notes
on
in
august
we
are
told
she
wrote
a
little
play
about
landlords
and
tenants
for
the
children
of
her
sister
beddoes
edgeworth
tried
to
get
the
play
produced
on
the
london
boards
writing
to
her
aunt
ruxton
maria
says
has
answered
as
i
foresaw
he
must
that
in
the
present
state
of
this
country
the
lord
chamberlain
would
not
license
the
absentee
besides
there
would
be
a
difficulty
in
finding
actors
for
so
many
irish
characters
the
little
drama
was
then
turned
into
a
story
by
edgeworth
advice
patronage
was
laid
aside
for
the
moment
and
the
absentee
appeared
in
its
place
in
the
second
part
of
tales
of
fashionable
life
we
all
know
lord
macaulay
verdict
upon
this
favourite
story
of
his
the
last
scene
of
which
he
specially
admired
and
compared
to
the
odyssey
lord
macaulay
was
not
the
only
notable
admirer
of
the
absentee
the
present
writer
remembers
hearing
professor
ruskin
on
one
occasion
break
out
in
praise
and
admiration
of
the
book
can
learn
more
by
reading
it
of
irish
politics
he
said
from
a
thousand
columns
out
of
edgeworth
tells
us
that
much
of
it
was
written
while
maria
was
suffering
a
misery
of
toothache
miss
edgeworth
own
letters
all
about
this
time
are
much
more
concerned
with
sociabilities
than
with
literature
we
read
of
a
pleasant
dance
at
burke
of
philosophers
at
sport
in
connemara
of
cribbage
and
company
and
country
houses
and
lord
longford
merry
anecdotes
during
her
visit
to
him
miss
edgeworth
who
scarcely
mentions
her
own
works
seems
much
interested
at
this
time
in
a
book
called
mary
and
her
cat
which
she
is
reading
with
some
of
the
children
little
scraps
of
news
i
can
not
resist
quoting
one
or
two
of
them
come
in
oddly
mixed
with
these
personal
records
of
work
and
family
talk
is
news
of
the
empress
marie
louise
who
is
liked
not
at
all
by
the
parisians
she
is
too
haughty
and
sits
back
in
her
carriage
when
she
goes
through
the
streets
josephine
who
is
living
very
happily
amusing
herself
with
her
gardens
and
her
shrubberies
this
empress
and
kennedy
and
the
seedsmen
are
in
partnership
says
miss
edgeworth
and
then
among
the
lists
of
all
the
grand
people
maria
meets
in
london
in
madame
de
stael
is
mentioned
as
expected
she
gives
an
interesting
account
of
an
actual
visitor
peggy
langan
who
was
to
thady
in
castle
rackrent
peggy
went
to
england
with
beddoes
and
was
for
thirty
years
in
the
service
of
haldimand
we
are
told
and
was
own
sister
to
simple
susan
the
story
of
the
absentee
is
a
very
simple
one
and
concerns
irish
landlords
living
in
england
who
ignore
their
natural
duties
and
station
in
life
and
whose
chief
ambition
is
to
take
their
place
in
the
english
fashionable
world
the
grand
english
ladies
are
talking
of
lady
clonbrony
if
you
knew
all
she
endures
to
look
speak
move
breathe
like
an
englishwoman
you
would
pity
her
said
lady
langdale
yes
and
you
cawnt
conceive
the
peens
she
teekes
to
talk
of
the
teebles
and
cheers
and
to
thank
q
and
with
so
much
teeste
to
speak
pure
english
said
dareville
pure
cockney
you
mean
said
lady
langdale
lord
colambre
the
son
of
the
lady
in
question
here
walks
across
the
room
not
wishing
to
listen
to
any
more
strictures
upon
his
mother
he
is
the
very
most
charming
of
walking
gentlemen
and
when
stung
by
conscience
he
goes
off
to
ireland
disguised
in
a
big
cloak
to
visit
his
father
tenantry
and
to
judge
for
himself
of
the
state
of
affairs
all
our
sympathies
go
with
him
on
his
way
he
stops
at
tusculum
scarcely
less
well
known
than
its
classical
namesake
he
is
entertained
by
raffarty
that
esthetical
lady
who
is
determined
to
have
a
little
of
everything
at
tusculum
she
leads
the
way
into
a
little
conservatory
and
a
little
pinery
and
a
little
grapery
and
a
little
aviary
and
a
little
pheasantry
and
a
little
dairy
for
show
and
a
little
cottage
for
ditto
with
a
grotto
full
of
shells
and
a
little
hermitage
full
of
earwigs
and
a
little
ruin
full
of
to
enlarge
and
multiply
the
effect
of
the
gothic
but
you
could
only
put
your
head
in
because
it
was
just
fresh
painted
and
though
there
had
been
a
fire
ordered
in
the
ruin
all
night
it
had
only
smoked
they
proceeded
and
walked
through
the
grounds
from
which
raffarty
though
she
had
done
her
best
could
not
take
that
which
nature
had
given
she
pointed
out
to
my
lord
a
happy
moving
termination
consisting
of
a
chinese
bridge
with
a
fisherman
leaning
over
the
rails
on
a
sudden
the
fisherman
was
seen
to
tumble
over
the
bridge
into
the
water
the
gentlemen
ran
to
extricate
the
poor
fellow
while
they
heard
raffarty
bawling
to
his
lordship
to
beg
he
would
never
mind
and
not
trouble
himself
they
arrived
at
the
bridge
they
saw
the
man
hanging
from
part
of
the
bridge
and
apparently
struggling
in
the
water
but
when
they
attempted
to
pull
him
up
they
found
it
was
only
a
stuffed
figure
which
had
been
pulled
into
the
stream
by
a
real
fish
which
had
seized
hold
of
the
bait
the
is
too
long
to
quote
but
it
is
written
in
miss
edgeworth
most
racy
and
delightful
vein
of
fun
one
more
little
fact
should
not
be
omitted
in
any
mention
of
the
absentee
one
of
the
heroines
is
miss
broadhurst
the
heiress
the
edgeworth
family
were
much
interested
soon
after
the
book
appeared
to
hear
that
a
real
living
miss
broadhurst
an
heiress
had
appeared
upon
the
scenes
and
was
moreover
engaged
to
be
married
to
sneyd
edgeworth
one
of
the
eldest
sons
of
the
family
in
the
story
says
edgeworth
miss
broadhurst
selects
from
her
lovers
one
who
worth
and
wit
and
then
she
goes
on
to
quote
an
old
epigram
of
edgeworth
on
himself
which
concluded
with
an
edge
to
his
wit
and
there
worth
in
his
heart
edgeworth
who
was
as
usual
busy
building
church
spires
for
himself
and
other
people
abandoned
his
engineering
for
a
time
to
criticise
his
daughter
story
and
he
advised
that
the
conclusion
of
the
absentee
should
be
a
letter
from
larry
the
postilion
wrote
one
she
wrote
another
says
edgeworth
much
preferred
hers
which
is
the
admirable
finale
of
the
absentee
and
just
about
this
time
lord
ross
is
applied
to
to
frank
the
edgeworth
manuscripts
can
not
by
any
form
of
words
express
how
delighted
i
am
that
you
are
none
of
you
angry
with
me
writes
modest
maria
to
her
cousin
miss
ruxton
that
my
uncle
and
aunt
are
pleased
with
what
they
have
read
of
the
absentee
i
long
to
hear
whether
their
favour
continues
to
the
end
and
extends
to
the
catastrophe
that
dangerous
rock
upon
which
poor
authors
are
wrecked
the
absentee
chapter
i
you
to
be
at
lady
clonbrony
gala
next
week
said
lady
langdale
to
dareville
whilst
they
were
waiting
for
their
carriages
in
the
of
the
opera
house
yes
everybody
to
be
there
i
hear
replied
dareville
ladyship
of
course
i
do
know
if
i
possibly
can
lady
clonbrony
makes
it
such
a
point
with
me
that
i
believe
i
must
look
in
upon
her
for
a
few
minutes
they
are
going
to
a
prodigious
expense
on
this
occasion
soho
tells
me
the
reception
rooms
are
all
to
be
new
furnished
and
in
the
most
magnificent
style
what
a
famous
rate
those
clonbronies
are
dashing
on
said
colonel
heathcock
to
anything
are
they
these
clonbronies
that
one
hears
of
so
much
of
late
said
her
grace
of
torcaster
absentees
i
know
but
how
do
they
support
all
this
enormous
expense
son
will
have
a
prodigiously
fine
estate
when
some
quin
dies
said
dareville
everybody
who
comes
from
ireland
will
have
a
fine
estate
when
somebody
dies
said
her
grace
what
have
they
at
present
thousand
a
year
they
say
replied
dareville
thousand
i
believe
cried
lady
langdale
it
a
rule
you
know
to
believe
only
half
the
world
says
thousand
have
they
possibly
said
her
grace
know
nothing
about
them
have
no
acquaintance
among
the
irish
torcaster
knows
something
of
lady
clonbrony
she
has
fastened
herself
by
some
means
upon
him
but
i
charge
him
not
to
commit
me
positively
i
could
not
for
anybody
and
much
less
for
that
sort
of
person
extend
the
circle
of
my
acquaintance
that
is
so
cruel
of
your
grace
said
dareville
laughing
poor
lady
clonbrony
works
so
hard
and
pays
so
high
to
get
into
certain
circles
you
knew
all
she
endures
to
look
speak
move
breathe
like
an
englishwoman
you
would
pity
her
said
lady
langdale
and
you
cawnt
conceive
the
peens
she
teekes
to
talk
of
the
teebles
and
cheers
and
to
thank
q
and
with
so
much
teeste
to
speak
pure
english
said
dareville
cockney
you
mean
said
lady
langdale
why
does
lady
clonbrony
want
to
pass
for
english
said
the
duchess
because
she
is
not
quite
irish
bred
and
born
only
bred
not
born
said
dareville
she
could
not
be
five
minutes
in
your
grace
company
before
she
would
tell
you
that
she
was
henglish
born
in
hoxfordshire
must
be
a
vastly
amusing
personage
i
should
like
to
meet
her
if
one
could
see
and
hear
her
said
the
duchess
lord
clonbrony
what
is
he
nobody
said
dareville
never
even
hears
of
him
tribe
of
daughters
too
i
suppose
no
said
lady
langdale
would
be
past
all
endurance
a
cousin
though
a
grace
nugent
said
dareville
lady
clonbrony
has
with
her
part
of
her
too
said
colonel
heathcock
fine
girl
never
saw
her
look
better
than
at
the
opera
complexion
as
lady
clonbrony
says
when
she
means
a
high
colour
said
lady
langdale
nugent
is
not
a
lady
beauty
said
dareville
she
any
fortune
colonel
honour
do
know
said
the
colonel
a
son
somewhere
is
not
there
said
lady
langdale
know
honour
replied
the
colonel
at
cambridge
not
of
age
yet
said
dareville
me
here
is
lady
clonbrony
come
back
i
thought
she
was
gone
half
an
hour
ago
whispered
one
of
lady
langdale
daughters
leaning
between
her
mother
and
dareville
is
that
gentleman
that
passed
us
just
now
way
the
door
there
now
mamma
you
can
see
him
he
is
speaking
to
lady
clonbrony
to
miss
nugent
now
lady
clonbrony
is
introducing
him
to
miss
broadhurst
see
him
now
said
lady
langdale
examining
him
through
her
glass
very
young
man
indeed
an
irishman
i
am
sure
by
his
manner
said
her
grace
said
lady
langdale
is
miss
broadhurst
talking
to
now
really
honour
do
know
replied
heathcock
yet
he
certainly
looks
like
somebody
one
certainly
should
know
pursued
lady
langdale
i
do
recollect
seeing
him
anywhere
before
now
was
all
the
satisfaction
she
could
gain
from
the
insensible
immovable
colonel
however
her
ladyship
after
sending
a
whisper
along
the
line
gained
the
desired
information
that
the
young
gentleman
was
lord
colambre
son
only
son
of
lord
and
lady
clonbrony
that
he
was
just
come
from
cambridge
that
he
was
not
yet
of
age
that
he
would
be
of
age
within
a
year
that
he
would
then
after
the
death
of
somebody
come
into
possession
of
a
fine
estate
by
the
mother
side
therefore
my
dear
said
she
turning
round
to
the
daughter
who
had
first
pointed
him
out
understand
we
should
never
talk
about
other
people
affairs
mamma
never
i
hope
to
goodness
mamma
lord
colambre
did
not
hear
what
you
and
dareville
were
saying
could
he
child
he
was
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
beg
your
pardon
he
was
at
my
elbow
close
behind
us
but
i
never
thought
about
him
till
i
heard
somebody
say
my
lord
heavens
i
hope
he
did
hear
for
my
part
i
said
nothing
cried
lady
langdale
for
my
part
i
said
nothing
but
what
everybody
knows
cried
dareville
for
my
part
i
am
guilty
only
of
hearing
said
the
duchess
pray
colonel
heathcock
have
the
goodness
to
see
what
my
people
are
about
and
what
chance
we
have
of
getting
away
duchess
of
torcaster
carriage
stops
the
way
a
joyful
sound
to
colonel
heathcock
and
to
her
grace
and
not
less
agreeable
at
this
instant
to
lady
langdale
who
the
moment
she
was
disembarrassed
of
the
duchess
pressed
through
the
crowd
to
lady
clonbrony
and
addressing
her
with
smiles
and
complacency
was
to
have
a
little
moment
to
speak
to
her
could
not
sooner
get
through
the
crowd
would
certainly
do
herself
the
honour
to
be
at
her
ladyship
gala
on
wednesday
while
lady
langdale
spoke
she
never
seemed
to
see
or
think
of
anybody
but
lady
clonbrony
though
all
the
time
she
was
intent
upon
every
motion
of
lord
colambre
and
whilst
she
was
obliged
to
listen
with
a
face
of
sympathy
to
a
long
complaint
of
lady
clonbrony
about
soho
want
of
taste
in
ottomans
she
was
vexed
to
perceive
that
his
lordship
showed
no
desire
to
be
introduced
to
her
or
to
her
daughters
but
on
the
contrary
was
standing
talking
to
miss
nugent
his
mother
at
the
end
of
her
speech
looked
round
for
colambre
called
him
twice
before
he
heard
introduced
him
to
lady
langdale
and
to
lady
and
lady
anne
and
to
dareville
to
all
of
whom
he
bowed
with
an
air
of
proud
coldness
which
gave
them
reason
to
regret
that
their
remarks
upon
his
mother
and
his
family
had
not
been
made
sotto
voce
langdale
carriage
stops
the
way
lord
colambre
made
no
offer
of
his
services
notwithstanding
a
look
from
his
mother
incapable
of
the
meanness
of
voluntarily
listening
to
a
conversation
not
intended
for
him
to
hear
he
had
however
been
compelled
by
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
to
remain
a
few
minutes
stationary
where
he
could
not
avoid
hearing
the
remarks
of
the
fashionable
friends
disdaining
dissimulation
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
displeasure
perhaps
his
vexation
was
increased
by
his
consciousness
that
there
was
some
mixture
of
truth
in
their
sarcasms
he
was
sensible
that
his
mother
in
some
points
her
manners
for
instance
was
oblivious
to
ridicule
and
satire
in
lady
clonbrony
address
there
was
a
mixture
of
constraint
affectation
and
indecision
unusual
in
a
person
of
her
birth
rank
and
knowledge
of
the
world
a
natural
and
unnatural
manner
seemed
struggling
in
all
her
gestures
and
in
every
syllable
that
she
articulated
a
naturally
free
familiar
precipitate
irish
manner
had
been
schooled
and
schooled
late
in
life
into
a
sober
cold
still
stiff
deportment
which
she
mistook
for
english
a
strong
hibernian
accent
she
had
with
infinite
difficulty
changed
into
an
english
tone
mistaking
reverse
of
wrong
for
right
she
caricatured
the
english
pronunciation
and
the
extraordinary
precision
of
her
london
phraseology
betrayed
her
not
to
be
a
londoner
as
the
man
who
strove
to
pass
for
an
athenian
was
detected
by
his
attic
dialect
not
aware
of
her
real
danger
lady
clonbrony
was
on
the
opposite
side
in
continual
apprehension
every
time
she
opened
her
lips
lest
some
treacherous
a
or
e
some
strong
r
some
puzzling
aspirate
or
some
unguarded
note
interrogative
or
expostulatory
should
betray
her
to
be
an
irishwoman
dareville
had
in
her
mimickry
perhaps
a
little
exaggerated
as
to
the
teebles
and
cheers
but
still
the
general
likeness
of
the
representation
of
lady
clonbrony
was
strong
enough
to
strike
and
vex
her
son
he
had
now
for
the
first
time
an
opportunity
of
judging
of
the
estimation
in
which
his
mother
and
his
family
were
held
by
certain
leaders
of
the
ton
of
whom
in
her
letters
she
had
spoken
so
much
and
into
whose
society
or
rather
into
whose
parties
she
had
been
admitted
he
saw
that
the
renegade
cowardice
with
which
she
denied
abjured
and
reviled
her
own
country
gained
nothing
but
ridicule
and
contempt
he
loved
his
mother
and
whilst
he
endeavoured
to
conceal
her
faults
and
foibles
as
much
as
possible
from
his
own
heart
he
could
not
endure
those
who
dragged
them
to
light
and
ridicule
the
next
morning
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
lord
colambre
remembrance
when
he
awoke
was
the
sound
of
the
contemptuous
emphasis
which
had
been
laid
on
the
words
irish
absentees
this
led
to
recollections
of
his
native
country
to
comparisons
of
past
and
present
scenes
to
future
plans
of
life
young
and
careless
as
he
seemed
lord
colambre
was
capable
of
serious
reflection
of
naturally
quick
and
strong
capacity
ardent
affections
impetuous
temper
the
early
years
of
his
childhood
passed
at
his
father
castle
in
ireland
where
from
the
lowest
servant
to
the
dependant
of
the
family
everybody
had
conspired
to
wait
upon
to
fondle
to
flatter
to
worship
this
darling
of
their
lord
yet
he
was
not
spoiled
not
rendered
selfish
for
in
the
midst
of
this
flattery
and
servility
some
strokes
of
genuine
generous
affection
had
gone
home
to
his
little
heart
and
though
unqualified
submission
had
increased
the
natural
impetuosity
of
his
temper
and
though
visions
of
his
future
grandeur
had
touched
his
infant
thought
yet
fortunately
before
he
acquired
any
fixed
habits
of
insolence
or
tyranny
he
was
carried
far
away
from
all
that
were
bound
or
willing
to
submit
to
his
commands
far
away
from
all
signs
of
hereditary
grandeur
plunged
into
one
of
our
great
public
schools
into
a
new
world
forced
to
struggle
mind
and
body
with
his
equals
his
rivals
the
little
lord
became
a
spirited
schoolboy
and
in
time
a
man
fortunately
for
him
science
and
literature
happened
to
be
the
fashion
among
a
set
of
clever
young
men
with
whom
he
was
at
cambridge
his
ambition
for
intellectual
superiority
was
raised
his
views
were
enlarged
his
tastes
and
his
manners
formed
the
sobriety
of
english
good
sense
mixed
most
advantageously
with
irish
vivacity
english
prudence
governed
but
did
not
extinguish
his
irish
enthusiasm
but
in
fact
english
and
irish
had
not
been
invidiously
contrasted
in
his
mind
he
had
been
so
long
resident
in
england
and
so
intimately
connected
with
englishmen
that
he
was
not
oblivious
to
any
of
the
commonplace
ridicule
thrown
upon
hibernians
and
he
had
lived
with
men
who
were
too
well
informed
and
liberal
to
misjudge
or
depreciate
a
sister
country
he
had
found
from
experience
that
however
reserved
the
english
may
be
in
manner
they
are
warm
at
heart
that
however
averse
they
may
be
from
forming
new
acquaintance
their
esteem
and
confidence
once
gained
they
make
the
most
solid
friends
he
had
formed
friendships
in
england
he
was
fully
sensible
of
the
superior
comforts
refinement
and
information
of
english
society
but
his
own
country
was
endeared
to
him
by
early
association
and
a
sense
of
duty
and
patriotism
attached
him
to
ireland
and
shall
i
too
be
an
absentee
was
a
question
which
resulted
from
these
reflections
a
question
which
he
was
not
yet
prepared
to
answer
decidedly
in
the
meantime
the
first
business
of
the
morning
was
to
execute
a
commission
for
a
cambridge
friend
berryl
had
bought
from
mordicai
a
famous
london
coachmaker
a
curricle
warranted
sound
for
which
he
had
paid
a
sound
price
upon
express
condition
that
mordicai
barring
accidents
should
be
answerable
for
all
repairs
of
the
curricle
for
six
months
in
three
both
the
carriage
and
body
were
found
to
be
good
for
nothing
the
curricle
had
been
returned
to
mordicai
nothing
had
since
been
heard
of
it
or
from
him
and
lord
colambre
had
undertaken
to
pay
him
and
it
a
visit
and
to
make
all
proper
inquiries
accordingly
he
went
to
the
coachmaker
and
obtaining
no
satisfaction
from
the
underlings
desired
to
see
the
head
of
the
house
he
was
answered
that
mordicai
was
not
at
home
his
lordship
had
never
seen
mordicai
but
just
then
he
saw
walking
across
the
yard
a
man
who
looked
something
like
a
bond
street
coxcomb
but
not
the
least
like
a
gentleman
who
called
in
the
tone
of
a
master
for
mordicai
barouche
it
appeared
and
he
was
stepping
into
it
when
lord
colambre
took
the
liberty
of
stopping
him
and
pointing
to
the
wreck
of
berryl
curricle
now
standing
in
the
yard
began
a
statement
of
his
friend
grievances
and
an
appeal
to
common
justice
and
conscience
which
he
unknowing
the
nature
of
the
man
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
imagined
must
be
irresistible
mordicai
stood
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
dark
wooden
face
indeed
in
his
face
there
appeared
to
be
no
muscles
or
none
which
could
move
so
that
though
he
had
what
are
generally
called
handsome
features
there
was
all
together
something
unnatural
and
shocking
in
his
countenance
when
at
last
his
eyes
turned
and
his
lips
opened
this
seemed
to
be
done
by
machinery
and
not
by
the
will
of
a
living
creature
or
from
the
impulse
of
a
rational
soul
lord
colambre
was
so
much
struck
with
this
strange
physiognomy
that
he
actually
forgot
much
he
had
to
say
of
springs
and
wheels
but
it
was
no
matter
whatever
he
had
said
it
would
have
come
to
the
same
thing
and
mordicai
would
have
answered
as
he
now
did
it
was
my
partner
made
that
bargain
not
myself
and
i
do
hold
myself
bound
by
it
for
he
is
the
only
and
not
empowered
to
act
in
the
way
of
business
had
berryl
bargained
with
me
i
should
have
told
him
that
he
should
have
looked
to
these
things
before
his
carriage
went
out
of
our
yard
the
indignation
of
lord
colambre
kindled
at
these
words
but
in
vain
to
all
that
indignation
could
by
word
or
look
urge
against
mordicai
he
replied
so
sir
the
law
is
open
to
your
friend
the
law
is
open
to
all
men
who
can
pay
for
it
lord
colambre
turned
in
despair
from
the
callous
and
listened
to
one
of
his
more
workmen
who
was
reviewing
the
disabled
curricle
and
whilst
he
was
waiting
to
know
the
sum
of
his
friend
misfortune
a
fat
jolly
falstaff
looking
personage
came
into
the
yard
accosted
mordicai
with
a
degree
of
familiarity
which
from
a
gentleman
appeared
to
lord
colambre
to
be
almost
impossible
are
you
mordicai
my
good
fellow
cried
he
speaking
with
a
strong
irish
accent
is
this
whispered
lord
colambre
to
the
foreman
who
was
examining
the
curricle
terence
sir
there
must
be
entire
new
wheels
tell
me
my
tight
fellow
continued
sir
terence
holding
mordicai
fast
in
the
name
of
all
the
saints
good
or
bad
in
the
calendar
do
you
reckon
to
let
us
sport
the
suicide
mordicai
forcibly
drew
his
mouth
into
what
he
meant
for
a
smile
and
answered
soon
as
possible
sir
terence
sir
terence
in
a
tone
of
jocose
wheedling
expostulation
entreated
him
to
have
the
carriage
finished
out
of
hand
now
mordy
my
precious
let
us
have
it
by
the
birthday
and
come
and
dine
with
us
o
monday
at
the
hibernian
hotel
there
a
rare
one
will
you
mordicai
accepted
the
invitation
and
promised
faithfully
that
the
suicide
should
be
finished
by
the
birthday
sir
terence
shook
hands
upon
this
promise
and
after
telling
a
good
story
which
made
one
of
the
workmen
in
the
yard
an
irishman
grin
with
delight
walked
off
mordicai
first
waiting
till
the
knight
was
out
of
hearing
called
aloud
grinning
rascal
mind
at
your
peril
and
do
let
that
there
carriage
be
touched
d
see
till
further
orders
one
of
mordicai
clerks
with
a
huge
pen
behind
his
ear
observed
that
mordicai
was
right
in
that
caution
for
that
to
the
best
of
his
comprehension
sir
terence
and
his
principal
too
were
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
mordicai
coolly
answered
that
he
was
well
aware
of
that
but
that
the
estate
could
afford
to
dip
further
that
for
his
part
he
was
under
no
apprehension
he
knew
how
to
look
sharp
and
to
bite
before
he
was
bit
that
he
knew
sir
terence
and
his
principal
were
leagued
together
to
give
the
creditors
the
go
by
but
that
clever
as
they
both
were
at
that
work
he
trusted
he
was
their
match
you
be
so
good
sir
to
finish
making
out
this
estimate
for
me
interrupted
lord
colambre
sir
pound
four
and
the
perch
let
us
see
mordicai
ask
him
ask
paddy
about
sir
terence
said
the
foreman
pointing
back
over
his
shoulder
to
the
irish
workman
who
was
at
this
moment
pretending
to
be
wondrous
hard
at
work
however
when
mordicai
defied
him
to
tell
him
anything
he
did
not
know
paddy
parting
with
an
untasted
bit
of
tobacco
began
and
recounted
some
of
sir
terence
exploits
in
evading
duns
replevying
cattle
fighting
sheriffs
bribing
subs
managing
cants
tricking
custodees
in
language
so
strange
and
with
a
countenance
and
gestures
so
full
of
enjoyment
of
the
jest
that
whilst
mordicai
stood
for
a
moment
aghast
with
astonishment
lord
colambre
could
not
help
laughing
partly
at
and
partly
with
his
countryman
all
the
yard
were
in
a
roar
of
laughter
though
they
did
not
understand
half
of
what
they
heard
but
their
risible
muscles
were
acted
upon
mechanically
or
maliciously
merely
by
the
sound
of
the
irish
brogue
mordicai
waiting
till
the
laugh
was
over
dryly
observed
that
law
is
executed
in
another
guess
sort
of
way
in
england
from
what
it
is
in
ireland
therefore
for
his
part
he
desired
nothing
better
than
to
set
his
wits
fairly
against
such
sharks
that
there
was
a
pleasure
in
doing
up
a
debtor
which
none
but
a
creditor
could
know
a
moment
sir
if
you
have
a
moment
patience
sir
if
you
please
said
the
slow
foreman
to
lord
colambre
must
go
down
the
pounds
once
more
and
then
i
let
you
have
it
tell
you
what
smithfield
continued
mordicai
coming
close
beside
his
foreman
and
speaking
very
low
but
with
a
voice
trembling
with
anger
for
he
was
piqued
by
his
foreman
doubts
of
his
capacity
to
cope
with
sir
terence
tell
you
what
smithfield
i
be
cursed
if
i
do
get
every
inch
of
them
into
my
power
you
know
how
are
the
best
judge
sir
replied
the
foreman
i
would
not
undertake
sir
terence
and
the
question
is
whether
the
estate
will
answer
the
lot
of
the
debts
and
whether
you
know
them
all
for
certain
do
sir
i
tell
you
there
green
there
blancham
there
gray
there
soho
naming
several
more
and
to
my
knowledge
lord
clonbrony
sir
cried
lord
colambre
in
a
voice
which
made
mordicai
and
everybody
present
start
am
his
son
devil
said
mordicai
bless
every
bone
in
his
body
then
he
an
irishman
cried
paddy
there
was
the
rason
my
heart
warmed
to
him
from
the
first
minute
he
come
into
the
yard
though
i
did
not
know
it
till
now
sir
are
you
my
lord
colambre
said
mordicai
recovering
but
not
clearly
recovering
his
intellects
beg
pardon
but
i
did
not
know
you
was
lord
colambre
i
thought
you
told
me
you
was
the
friend
of
mr
berryl
do
not
see
the
incompatibility
of
the
assertion
sir
replied
lord
colambre
taking
from
the
bewildered
foreman
unresisting
hand
the
account
which
he
had
been
so
long
furnishing
me
leave
my
lord
said
mordicai
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
perhaps
we
can
compromise
that
business
for
your
friend
berryl
since
he
is
your
lordship
friend
perhaps
we
can
contrive
to
compromise
and
split
the
difference
to
compromise
and
split
the
difference
mordicai
thought
were
favourite
phrases
and
approved
hibernian
modes
of
doing
business
which
would
conciliate
this
young
irish
nobleman
and
dissipate
the
proud
tempest
which
had
gathered
and
now
swelled
in
his
breast
sir
no
cried
lord
colambre
holding
firm
the
paper
want
no
favour
from
you
i
will
accept
of
none
for
my
friend
or
for
myself
no
my
lord
i
should
not
presume
to
offer
but
i
should
wish
if
you
allow
me
to
do
your
friend
justice
lord
colambre
recollecting
that
he
had
no
right
in
his
pride
to
ding
away
his
friend
money
let
mordicai
look
at
the
account
and
his
impetuous
temper
in
a
few
moments
recovered
by
good
sense
he
considered
that
as
his
person
was
utterly
unknown
to
mordicai
no
offence
could
have
been
intended
to
him
and
that
perhaps
in
what
had
been
said
of
his
father
debts
and
distress
there
might
be
more
truth
than
he
was
aware
of
prudently
therefore
controlling
his
feelings
and
commanding
himself
he
suffered
mordicai
to
show
him
into
a
parlour
to
settle
his
friend
business
in
a
few
minutes
the
account
was
reduced
to
a
reasonable
form
and
in
consideration
of
the
partner
having
made
the
bargain
by
which
mordicai
felt
himself
influenced
in
honour
though
not
bound
in
law
he
undertook
to
have
the
curricle
made
better
than
new
again
for
berryl
for
twenty
guineas
then
came
awkward
apologies
to
lord
colambre
which
he
ill
endured
ourselves
my
lord
continued
mordicai
but
the
familiarity
of
the
phrase
ourselves
this
implication
of
equality
lord
colambre
could
not
admit
he
moved
hastily
towards
the
door
and
departed
chapter
ii
full
of
what
he
had
heard
and
impatient
to
obtain
further
information
respecting
the
state
of
his
father
affairs
lord
colambre
hastened
home
but
his
father
was
out
and
his
mother
was
engaged
with
soho
directing
or
rather
being
directed
how
her
apartments
should
be
fitted
up
for
her
gala
as
lord
colambre
entered
the
room
he
saw
his
mother
miss
nugent
and
soho
standing
at
a
large
table
which
was
covered
with
rolls
of
paper
patterns
and
drawings
of
furniture
soho
was
speaking
in
a
conceited
dictatorial
tone
asserting
that
there
was
no
in
nature
for
that
room
equal
to
the
fawn
which
fawn
he
so
pronounced
that
lady
clonbrony
understood
it
to
be
la
belle
uniforme
and
under
this
mistake
repeated
and
assented
to
the
assertion
till
it
was
set
to
rights
with
condescending
superiority
by
the
upholsterer
this
first
architectural
upholsterer
of
the
age
as
he
styled
himself
and
was
universally
admitted
to
be
by
all
the
world
of
fashion
then
with
full

the
corners
covered
with
blue
silk
and
silver
fringe
elegantly
fanciful
with
my
statira
canopy
here
light
blue
silk
draperies
aerial
tint
with
silver
balls
and
for
seats
here
the
seraglio
ottomans
superfine
scarlet
your
paws
griffin
golden
and
golden
tripods
here
with
antique
cranes
and
oriental
alabaster
tables
here
and
there
quite
appropriate
your
feels
let
me
reflect
for
the
next
apartment
it
strikes
me
as
your
do
value
expense
the
alhambra
hangings
my
own
thought
entirely
now
before
i
unroll
them
lady
clonbrony
i
must
beg
you
not
mention
i
shown
them
i
give
you
my
sacred
honour
not
a
soul
has
set
eye
upon
the
alhambra
hangings
except
dareville
who
stole
a
peep
i
refused
absolutely
refused
the
duchess
of
torcaster
but
i
ca
refuse
your
so
see
unrolling
them
scagliola
porphyry
columns
supporting
the
grand
dome
entablature
silvered
and
decorated
with
imitative
bronze
ornaments
under
the
entablature
a
valance
in
pelmets
of
puffed
scarlet
silk
would
have
an
unparalleled
grand
effect
seen
through
the
arches
with
the
trebisond
trellice
paper
would
make
a
tout
ensemble
novel
beyond
example
on
that
trebisond
trellice
paper
i
confess
ladies
i
do
pique
myself
for
the
little
room
i
recommend
turning
it
temporarily
into
a
chinese
pagoda
with
this
chinese
pagoda
paper
with
the
porcelain
border
and
josses
and
jars
and
beakers
to
match
and
i
can
venture
to
promise
one
vase
of
size
and
beauty
oh
indubitably
if
your
prefers
it
you
can
have
the
egyptian
hieroglyphic
paper
with
the
ibis
border
to
match
the
only
objection
is
one
sees
it
everywhere
quite
antediluvian
gone
to
the
hotels
even
but
to
be
sure
if
your
has
a
fancy
at
all
events
i
humbly
recommend
what
her
grace
of
torcaster
longs
to
patronise
my
moon
curtains
with
candlelight
draperies
a
demisaison
elegance
this
i
hit
off
yesterday
and
true
your
quite
correct
out
of
the
common
completely
and
of
course
you
have
the
sphynx
candelabras
and
the
phoenix
argands
oh
nothing
else
lights
now
expense
expense
of
the
whole
impossible
to
calculate
here
on
the
spot
but
nothing
at
all
worth
your
ladyship
consideration
at
another
moment
lord
colambre
might
have
been
amused
with
all
this
rhodomontade
and
with
the
airs
and
voluble
conceit
of
the
orator
but
after
what
he
had
heard
at
mordicai
this
whole
scene
struck
him
more
with
melancholy
than
with
mirth
he
was
alarmed
by
the
prospect
of
new
and
unbounded
expense
provoked
almost
past
enduring
by
the
jargon
and
impertinence
of
this
upholsterer
mortified
and
vexed
to
the
heart
to
see
his
mother
the
dupe
the
sport
of
such
a
coxcomb
of
puppies
insufferable
my
own
mother
lord
colambre
repeated
to
himself
as
he
walked
hastily
up
and
down
the
room
wo
you
let
us
have
your
judgment
your
teeste
said
his
mother
me
i
have
no
taste
no
judgment
in
these
things
he
sometimes
paused
and
looked
at
soho
with
a
strong
inclination
to
but
knowing
that
he
should
say
too
much
if
he
said
anything
he
was
silent
never
dared
to
approach
the
council
table
but
continued
walking
up
and
down
the
room
till
he
heard
a
voice
which
at
once
arrested
his
attention
and
soothed
his
ire
he
approached
the
table
instantly
and
listened
whilst
grace
nugent
said
everything
he
wished
to
have
said
and
with
all
the
propriety
and
delicacy
with
which
he
thought
he
could
not
have
spoken
he
leaned
on
the
table
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
years
ago
he
had
seen
his
cousin
last
night
he
had
thought
her
handsome
pleasing
graceful
but
now
he
saw
a
new
person
or
he
saw
her
in
a
new
light
he
marked
the
superior
intelligence
the
animation
the
eloquence
of
her
countenance
its
variety
whilst
alternately
with
arch
raillery
or
grave
humour
she
played
off
soho
and
made
him
magnify
the
ridicule
till
it
was
apparent
even
to
lady
clonbrony
he
observed
the
anxiety
lest
his
mother
should
expose
her
own
foibles
he
was
touched
by
the
respectful
earnest
kindness
the
soft
tones
of
persuasion
with
which
she
addressed
his
mother
the
care
not
to
presume
upon
her
own
influence
the
good
sense
the
taste
she
showed
yet
not
displaying
her
superiority
the
address
temper
and
patience
with
which
she
at
last
accomplished
her
purpose
and
prevented
lady
clonbrony
from
doing
anything
preposterously
absurd
or
exorbitantly
extravagant
lord
colambre
was
actually
sorry
when
the
business
was
ended
when
soho
departed
for
grace
nugent
was
then
silent
and
it
was
necessary
to
remove
his
eyes
from
that
countenance
on
which
he
had
gazed
unobserved
beautiful
and
graceful
yet
so
unconscious
was
she
of
her
charms
that
the
eye
of
admiration
could
rest
upon
her
without
her
perceiving
it
she
seemed
so
intent
upon
others
as
totally
to
forget
herself
the
whole
train
of
lord
colambre
thoughts
was
so
completely
deranged
that
although
he
was
sensible
there
was
something
of
importance
he
had
to
say
to
his
mother
yet
when
soho
departure
left
him
opportunity
to
speak
he
stood
silent
unable
to
recollect
anything
but
grace
nugent
when
grace
nugent
left
the
room
after
some
minutes
silence
and
some
effort
lord
colambre
said
to
his
mother
madam
do
you
know
anything
of
sir
terence
said
lady
clonbrony
drawing
up
her
head
proudly
know
he
is
a
person
i
can
not
endure
he
is
no
friend
of
mine
i
can
assure
you
nor
any
such
sort
of
person
thought
it
was
impossible
cried
colambre
with
exultation
only
wish
your
father
colambre
could
say
as
much
added
lady
clonbrony
lord
colambre
countenance
fell
again
and
again
he
was
silent
for
some
time
my
father
dine
at
home
suppose
not
he
seldom
dines
at
home
my
father
may
have
some
cause
to
be
uneasy
about
said
lady
clonbrony
in
a
tone
and
with
a
look
of
curiosity
which
convinced
her
son
that
she
knew
nothing
of
his
debts
or
distresses
if
he
had
any
what
repeated
her
ladyship
here
was
no
receding
and
lord
colambre
never
had
recourse
to
artifice
his
affairs
i
was
going
to
say
madam
but
since
you
know
nothing
of
any
difficulties
or
embarrassments
i
am
persuaded
that
none
exist
nay
i
cawnt
tell
you
that
colambre
there
are
difficulties
for
ready
money
i
confess
when
i
ask
for
it
which
surprise
me
often
i
know
nothing
of
affairs
ladies
of
a
certain
rank
seldom
do
you
know
but
considering
your
father
estate
and
the
fortune
i
brought
him
added
her
ladyship
proudly
cawnt
conceive
it
at
all
grace
nugent
indeed
often
talks
to
me
of
embarrassments
and
economy
but
that
poor
thing
is
very
natural
for
her
because
her
fortune
is
not
particularly
large
and
she
has
left
it
all
or
almost
all
in
her
uncle
and
guardian
hands
i
know
she
often
distressed
for
odd
money
to
lend
me
and
that
makes
her
anxious
not
miss
nugent
very
much
admired
in
london
course
in
the
company
she
is
in
you
know
she
has
every
advantage
and
she
has
a
natural
family
air
of
fashion
not
but
what
she
would
have
got
on
much
better
if
when
she
first
appeared
in
she
had
taken
my
advice
and
wrote
herself
on
her
cards
miss
de
nogent
which
would
have
taken
off
the
prejudice
against
the
iricism
of
nugent
you
know
and
there
is
a
count
de
nogent
did
not
know
there
was
any
such
prejudice
there
may
be
among
a
certain
set
but
i
should
think
not
among
people
big
your
pawdon
colambre
surely
i
that
was
born
in
england
an
bawn
must
be
well
infawmed
on
this
pint
anyway
lord
colambre
was
respectfully
silent
resumed
he
wonder
that
miss
nugent
is
not
married
is
her
own
entirely
she
has
refused
very
good
offers
establishments
that
i
own
i
think
as
lady
langdale
says
i
was
to
blame
to
allow
her
to
let
pass
but
young
ledies
till
they
are
twenty
always
think
they
can
do
better
martingale
of
martingale
proposed
for
her
but
she
objected
to
him
on
account
of
he
being
on
the
turf
and
albans
a
year
because
i
reelly
forget
what
i
believe
only
because
she
did
not
like
him
and
something
about
principles
now
there
is
colonel
heathcock
one
of
the
most
fashionable
young
men
you
see
always
with
the
duchess
of
torcaster
and
that
set
heathcock
takes
a
vast
deal
of
notice
of
her
for
him
and
yet
i
persuaded
she
would
not
have
him
if
he
came
to
the
pint
and
for
no
reason
reelly
now
that
she
can
give
me
but
because
she
says
he
a
coxcomb
grace
has
a
tincture
of
irish
pride
but
for
my
part
i
rejoice
that
she
is
so
difficult
for
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
her
nugent
is
indeed
very
much
attached
to
you
mother
i
am
convinced
said
lord
colambre
beginning
his
sentence
with
great
enthusiasm
and
ending
it
with
great
sobriety
then
she
a
sweet
girl
and
i
am
very
partial
to
her
there
the
truth
cried
lady
clonbrony
in
an
undisguised
irish
accent
and
with
her
natural
warm
manner
but
a
moment
afterwards
her
features
and
whole
form
resumed
their
constrained
stillness
and
stiffness
and
in
her
english
accent
she
continued
you
put
my
idees
out
of
my
head
colambre
i
had
something
to
say
to
you
oh
i
know
what
it
was
we
were
talking
of
embarrassments
and
i
wished
to
do
your
father
the
justice
to
mention
to
you
that
he
has
been
uncommon
liberal
to
me
about
this
gala
and
has
reelly
given
me
and
i
a
notion
indeed
i
know
that
it
is
you
colambre
i
am
to
thank
for
this
did
not
your
father
give
you
any
hint
i
have
seen
my
father
but
for
half
an
hour
since
i
came
to
town
and
in
that
time
he
said
nothing
to
me
of
his
affairs
what
i
allude
to
is
more
your
affair
did
not
speak
to
me
of
any
affairs
he
spoke
only
of
my
horses
i
suppose
my
lord
leaves
it
to
me
to
open
the
matter
to
you
i
have
the
pleasure
to
tell
you
that
we
have
in
view
for
you
and
i
think
i
may
say
with
more
than
the
approbation
of
all
her
family
an
alliance
my
dear
mother
you
can
not
be
serious
cried
lord
colambre
know
i
am
not
of
years
of
discretion
yet
i
shall
not
think
of
marrying
these
ten
years
at
least
not
nay
my
dear
colambre
do
go
i
beg
i
am
serious
i
assure
you
and
to
convince
you
of
it
i
shall
tell
you
candidly
at
once
all
your
father
told
me
that
now
you
done
with
cambridge
and
are
come
to
he
agrees
with
me
in
wishing
that
you
should
make
the
figure
you
ought
to
make
colambre
as
sole
to
the
clonbrony
estate
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
on
the
other
hand
living
in
and
making
you
the
handsome
allowance
you
ought
to
have
are
both
together
more
than
your
father
can
afford
without
inconvenience
he
tells
me
assure
you
mother
i
shall
be
content
no
you
must
not
be
content
child
and
you
must
hear
me
you
must
live
in
a
becoming
style
and
make
a
proper
appearance
i
could
not
present
you
to
my
friends
here
nor
be
happy
if
you
did
not
colambre
now
the
way
is
clear
before
you
you
have
birth
and
title
here
is
fortune
ready
made
you
will
have
a
noble
estate
of
your
own
when
old
quin
dies
and
you
will
not
be
any
encumbrance
or
inconvenience
to
your
father
or
anybody
marrying
an
heiress
accomplishes
all
this
at
once
and
the
young
lady
is
everything
we
could
wish
besides
you
will
meet
again
at
the
gala
indeed
between
ourselves
she
is
the
grand
object
of
the
gala
all
her
friends
will
come
en
masse
and
one
should
wish
that
they
should
see
things
in
proper
style
you
have
seen
the
young
lady
in
question
colambre
miss
broadhurst
do
you
recollect
the
young
lady
i
introduced
you
to
last
night
after
the
opera
little
plain
girl
covered
with
diamonds
who
was
standing
beside
miss
nugent
yes
but
you
wo
think
her
plain
when
you
see
more
of
her
that
wears
off
i
thought
her
plain
at
first
i
hope
hope
said
lord
colambre
you
will
not
take
it
unkindly
of
me
my
dear
mother
if
i
tell
you
at
once
that
i
have
no
thoughts
of
marrying
at
present
and
that
i
never
will
marry
for
money
marrying
an
heiress
is
not
even
a
new
way
of
paying
old
debts
at
all
events
it
is
one
to
which
no
distress
could
persuade
me
to
have
recourse
and
as
i
must
if
i
outlive
old
quin
have
an
independent
fortune
there
is
no
occasion
to
purchase
one
by
marriage
is
no
distress
that
i
know
of
in
the
case
cried
lady
clonbrony
is
your
imagination
running
colambre
but
merely
for
your
establishment
your
independence
i
want
none
independence
i
do
desire
and
will
preserve
assure
my
father
my
dear
mother
that
i
will
not
be
an
expense
to
him
i
will
live
within
the
allowance
he
made
me
at
cambridge
i
will
give
up
half
of
it
i
will
do
anything
for
his
convenience
but
marry
for
money
that
i
can
not
do
colambre
you
are
very
disobliging
said
lady
clonbrony
with
an
expression
of
disappointment
and
displeasure
your
father
says
if
you
do
marry
miss
broadhurst
we
ca
live
in
another
winter
this
said
which
had
she
been
at
the
moment
mistress
of
herself
she
would
not
have
let
out
lady
clonbrony
abruptly
quitted
the
room
her
son
stood
motionless
saying
to
himself
this
my
mother
how
altered
the
next
morning
he
seized
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
his
father
whom
he
caught
with
difficulty
just
when
he
was
going
out
as
usual
for
the
day
lord
colambre
with
all
the
respect
due
to
his
father
and
with
that
affectionate
manner
by
which
he
always
knew
how
to
soften
the
strength
of
his
expressions
made
nearly
the
same
declarations
of
his
resolution
by
which
his
mother
had
been
so
much
surprised
and
offended
lord
clonbrony
seemed
more
embarrassed
but
not
so
much
displeased
when
lord
colambre
adverted
as
delicately
as
he
could
to
the
selfishness
of
desiring
from
him
the
sacrifice
of
liberty
for
life
to
say
nothing
of
his
affections
merely
to
enable
his
family
to
make
a
splendid
figure
in
london
lord
clonbrony
exclaimed
all
nonsense
cursed
nonsense
that
the
way
we
are
obliged
to
state
the
thing
to
your
mother
my
dear
boy
because
i
might
talk
her
deaf
before
she
would
understand
or
listen
to
anything
else
but
for
my
own
share
i
do
care
a
rush
if
london
was
sunk
in
the
salt
sea
little
dublin
for
my
money
as
sir
terence
says
is
sir
terence
may
i
ask
sir
do
you
know
terry
ay
you
been
so
long
at
cambridge
i
forgot
and
did
you
never
see
terry
have
seen
him
sir
i
met
him
yesterday
at
mordicai
the
coachmaker
exclaimed
lord
clonbrony
with
a
sudden
blush
which
he
endeavoured
to
hide
by
taking
snuff
is
a
damned
rascal
that
mordicai
i
hope
you
did
believe
a
word
he
said
nobody
does
that
knows
him
am
glad
sir
that
you
seem
to
know
him
so
well
and
to
be
upon
your
guard
against
him
replied
lord
colambre
from
what
i
heard
of
his
conversation
when
he
was
not
aware
who
i
was
i
am
convinced
he
would
do
you
any
injury
in
his
power
shall
never
have
me
in
his
power
i
promise
him
we
shall
take
care
of
that
but
what
did
he
say
lord
colambre
repeated
the
substance
of
what
mordicai
had
said
and
lord
clonbrony
reiterated
rascal
damned
rascal
i
get
out
of
his
hands
i
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
but
as
he
spoke
he
exhibited
evident
symptoms
of
uneasiness
moving
continually
and
shifting
from
leg
to
leg
like
a
foundered
horse
he
could
not
bring
himself
positively
to
deny
that
he
had
debts
and
difficulties
but
he
would
by
no
means
open
the
state
of
his
affairs
to
his
son
father
is
called
upon
to
do
that
said
he
to
himself
but
a
fool
would
do
it
lord
colambre
perceiving
his
father
embarrassment
withdrew
his
eyes
respectfully
refrained
from
all
further
inquiries
and
simply
repeated
the
assurance
he
had
made
to
his
mother
that
he
would
put
his
family
to
no
additional
expense
and
that
if
it
was
necessary
he
would
willingly
give
up
half
his
allowance
at
all
not
at
all
my
dear
boy
said
his
father
would
rather
cramp
myself
than
that
you
should
be
cramped
a
thousand
times
over
but
it
is
all
my
lady
clonbrony
nonsense
if
people
would
but
as
they
ought
stay
in
their
own
country
live
on
their
own
estates
and
kill
their
own
mutton
money
need
never
be
wanting
for
killing
their
own
mutton
lord
colambre
did
not
see
the
indispensable
necessity
but
he
rejoiced
to
hear
his
father
assert
that
people
should
reside
in
their
own
country
cried
lord
clonbrony
to
strengthen
his
assertion
as
he
always
thought
it
necessary
to
do
by
quoting
some
other
person
opinion
sir
terence
always
says
and
that
the
reason
your
mother
ca
endure
poor
terry
you
do
know
terry
no
you
have
only
seen
him
but
indeed
to
see
him
is
to
know
him
for
he
is
the
most
good
fellow
in
europe
do
pretend
to
know
him
yet
said
lord
colambre
am
not
so
presumptuous
as
to
form
my
opinion
at
first
sight
curse
your
modesty
interrupted
lord
clonbrony
mean
you
do
pretend
to
like
him
yet
but
terry
will
make
you
like
him
i
defy
you
not
i
introduce
you
to
him
him
to
you
i
mean
most
generous
dog
upon
earth
convivial
jovial
with
wit
and
humour
enough
in
his
own
way
to
split
you
split
me
if
he
has
not
you
need
not
cast
down
your
eyes
colambre
what
your
objection
have
made
none
sir
but
if
you
urge
me
i
can
only
say
that
if
he
has
all
these
good
qualities
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
he
does
not
look
and
speak
a
little
more
like
a
gentleman
gentleman
he
is
as
much
a
gentleman
as
any
of
your
formal
prigs
not
the
exact
cambridge
cut
maybe
curse
your
english
education
was
none
of
my
advice
i
suppose
you
mean
to
take
after
your
mother
in
the
notion
that
nothing
can
be
good
or
genteel
but
what
english
from
it
sir
i
assure
you
i
am
as
warm
a
friend
to
ireland
as
your
heart
could
wish
you
will
have
no
reason
in
that
respect
at
least
nor
i
hope
in
any
other
to
curse
my
english
education
and
if
my
gratitude
and
affection
can
avail
you
shall
never
regret
the
kindness
and
liberality
with
which
you
have
i
fear
distressed
yourself
to
afford
me
the
means
of
becoming
all
that
a
british
nobleman
ought
to
be
you
distress
me
now
said
lord
clonbrony
i
did
expect
it
or
i
would
make
a
fool
of
myself
this
way
added
he
ashamed
of
his
emotion
and
whiffling
it
off
have
an
irish
heart
that
i
see
which
no
education
can
spoil
but
you
must
like
terry
i
give
you
time
as
he
said
to
me
when
first
he
taught
me
to
like
usquebaugh
good
morning
to
you
whilst
lady
clonbrony
in
consequence
of
her
residence
in
london
had
become
more
of
a
fine
lady
lord
clonbrony
since
he
left
ireland
had
become
less
of
a
gentleman
lady
clonbrony
born
an
englishwoman
disclaiming
and
disencumbering
herself
of
all
the
irish
in
town
had
by
giving
splendid
entertainments
at
an
enormous
expense
made
her
way
into
a
certain
set
of
fashionable
company
but
lord
clonbrony
who
was
somebody
in
ireland
who
was
a
great
person
in
dublin
found
himself
nobody
in
england
a
mere
cipher
in
london
looked
down
upon
by
the
fine
people
with
whom
his
lady
associated
and
heartily
weary
of
them
he
retreated
from
them
altogether
and
sought
entertainment
and
in
society
beneath
him
indeed
both
in
rank
and
education
but
in
which
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
himself
the
first
person
in
company
of
these
associates
the
first
in
talents
and
in
jovial
profligacy
was
sir
terence
a
man
of
low
extraction
who
had
been
knighted
by
an
irish
in
some
convivial
frolic
no
one
could
tell
a
good
story
or
sing
a
good
song
better
than
sir
terence
he
exaggerated
his
native
brogue
and
his
natural
propensity
to
blunder
caring
little
whether
the
company
laughed
at
him
or
with
him
provided
they
laughed
and
laugh
laugh
and
live
was
his
motto
and
certainly
he
lived
on
laughing
as
well
as
many
better
men
can
contrive
to
live
on
a
thousand
a
year
lord
clonbrony
brought
sir
terence
home
with
him
next
day
to
introduce
him
to
lord
colambre
and
it
happened
that
on
this
occasion
terence
appeared
to
peculiar
disadvantage
because
like
many
other
people
gatoit
avoit
en
voulant
avoir
celui
pas
having
been
apprised
that
lord
colambre
was
a
fine
scholar
fresh
from
cambridge
and
being
conscious
of
his
own
deficiencies
of
literature
instead
of
trusting
to
his
natural
talents
he
summoned
to
his
aid
with
no
small
effort
all
the
scraps
of
learning
he
had
acquired
in
early
days
and
even
brought
before
the
company
all
the
gods
and
goddesses
with
whom
he
had
formed
an
acquaintance
at
school
though
embarrassed
by
this
unusual
encumbrance
of
learning
he
endeavoured
to
make
all
subservient
to
his
immediate
design
of
paying
his
court
to
lady
clonbrony
by
forwarding
the
object
she
had
most
anxiously
in
view
the
match
between
her
son
and
miss
broadhurst
so
miss
nugent
said
he
not
daring
with
all
his
assurance
to
address
himself
directly
to
lady
clonbrony
so
miss
nugent
you
are
going
to
have
great
doings
i
told
and
a
wonderful
grand
gala
there
nothing
in
the
wide
world
equal
to
being
in
a
good
handsome
crowd
no
later
now
than
the
last
ball
at
the
castle
that
was
before
i
left
dublin
miss
nugent
the
apartments
owing
to
the
popularity
of
my
was
so
throng
so
throng
that
i
remember
very
well
in
the
doorway
a
lady
and
a
very
genteel
woman
she
was
too
though
a
stranger
to
me
saying
to
me
sir
your
finger
in
my
ear
i
know
it
madam
says
i
but
i
ca
take
it
out
till
the
crowd
give
me
elbow
room
it
gala
i
thinking
of
now
i
hear
you
are
to
have
the
golden
venus
my
lady
clonbrony
wo
you
this
freezing
monosyllable
notwithstanding
sir
terence
pursued
his
course
fluently
golden
venus
sure
miss
nugent
you
that
are
so
quick
ca
but
know
i
would
apostrophise
miss
broadhurst
that
is
but
that
wo
be
long
so
i
hope
my
lord
colambre
have
you
seen
much
yet
of
that
young
lady
sir
i
hope
you
wo
be
long
so
i
hear
great
talk
now
of
the
venus
of
medicis
and
the
venus
of
this
and
that
with
the
florence
venus
and
the
sable
venus
and
that
other
venus
that
washing
of
her
hair
and
a
hundred
other
venuses
some
good
some
bad
but
be
that
as
it
will
my
lord
trust
a
fool
ye
may
when
he
tells
you
truth
the
golden
venus
is
the
only
one
on
earth
that
can
stand
or
that
will
stand
through
all
ages
and
temperatures
for
gold

court
gold

the
camp
and
men
below
and

take
care
terry
do
you
know
what
you
saying
interrupted
lord
clonbrony
i
do
i
replied
terry
if
you
please
my
lord
that
it
was
for
a
golden
pippin
that
the
three
goddesses
fit
and
that
the
hippomenes
was
about
golden
apples
and
did
not
hercules
rob
a
garden
for
golden
apples
and
did
not
the
pious
eneas
himself
take
a
golden
branch
with
him
to
make
himself
welcome
to
his
father
in
hell
said
sir
terence
winking
at
lord
colambre
terry
you
know
more
about
books
than
i
should
have
suspected
said
lord
clonbrony
you
would
not
have
suspected
me
to
have
such
a
great
acquaintance
among
the
goddesses
neither
would
you
my
lord
but
apropos
before
we
quit
of
what
material
think
ye
was
that
same
venus
famous
girdle
now
that
made
roses
and
lilies
so
quickly
appear
why
what
was
it
but
a
girdle
of
sterling
gold
i
engage
for
gold
is
the
only
true
thing
for
a
young
man
to
look
after
in
a
wife
sir
terence
paused
but
no
applause
ensued
them
talk
of
cupids
and
darts
and
the
mother
of
the
loves
and
graces
minerva
may
sing
odes
and
dythambrics
or
whatsoever
her
wisdomship
pleases
let
her
sing
or
let
her
say
she
never
get
a
husband
in
this
world
or
the
other
without
she
had
a
good
thumping
fortin
and
then
she
go
off
like
wildfire
no
terry
there
you
out
minerva
has
too
bad
a
character
for
learning
to
be
a
favourite
with
gentlemen
said
lord
clonbrony
do
tell
me
i
get
her
off
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
and
thank
you
too
if
she
had
fifty
thousand
down
or
a
thousand
a
year
in
land
would
you
have
a
man
so
nice
as
to
balk
when
house
and
land
is
because
of
the
encumbrance
of
a
little
learning
i
never
heard
that
miss
broadhurst
was
anything
of
a
learned
lady
broadhurst
said
grace
nugent
did
you
get
round
to
miss
broadhurst
by
the
way
of
tipperary
said
lord
colambre
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
it
was
apropos
to
a
good
fortune
which
i
hope
will
not
be
out
of
your
way
even
if
you
went
by
tipperary
she
has
besides
in
the
funds
a
clear
landed
property
of
per
annum
well
some
people
talk
of
morality
and
some
of
religion
but
give
me
a
little
snug
property
but
my
lord
i
a
little
business
to
transact
this
morning
and
must
not
be
idling
and
indulging
myself
here
so
bowing
to
the
ladies
he
departed
i
am
glad
that
man
is
gone
said
lady
clonbrony
a
relief
to
one
ears
i
am
sure
i
wonder
my
lord
how
you
can
bear
to
carry
that
strange
creature
always
about
with
you
so
vulgar
as
he
is
diverts
me
said
lord
clonbrony
many
of
your
fine
ladies
or
gentlemen
put
me
to
sleep
what
signifies
what
accent
people
speak
in
that
have
nothing
to
say
hey
colambre
lord
colambre
from
respect
to
his
father
did
not
express
his
opinion
but
his
aversion
to
sir
terence
was
stronger
even
than
his
mother
though
lady
clonbrony
detestation
of
him
was
much
increased
by
perceiving
that
his
coarse
hints
about
miss
broadhurst
had
operated
against
her
favourite
scheme
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
lord
clonbrony
talked
of
bringing
sir
terence
with
him
that
night
to
her
gala
she
absolutely
grew
pale
with
horror
heavens
lady
langdale
dareville
lady
pococke
lady
chatterton
lady
d
lady
g
his
grace
of
v
what
would
they
think
of
him
and
miss
broadhurst
to
see
him
going
about
with
my
lord
clonbrony
it
could
not
be
no
her
ladyship
made
the
most
solemn
and
desperate
protestation
that
she
would
sooner
give
up
her
gala
altogether
tie
up
the
knocker
say
she
was
sick
rather
be
sick
or
be
dead
than
be
obliged
to
have
such
a
creature
as
sir
terence
at
her
gala
it
your
own
way
my
dear
as
you
have
everything
else
cried
lord
clonbrony
taking
up
his
hat
and
preparing
to
decamp
take
notice
if
you
wo
receive
him
you
need
not
expect
me
so
a
good
morning
to
you
my
lady
clonbrony
you
may
find
a
worse
friend
in
need
yet
than
that
same
sir
terence
trust
i
shall
never
be
in
need
my
lord
replied
her
ladyship
would
be
strange
indeed
if
i
were
with
the
fortune
i
brought
that
fortune
of
hers
cried
lord
clonbrony
stopping
both
his
ears
as
he
ran
out
of
the
room
i
never
hear
the
end
of
that
fortune
when
i
seen
the
end
of
it
long
ago
during
this
matrimonial
dialogue
grace
nugent
and
lord
colambre
never
once
looked
at
each
other
grace
was
very
diligently
trying
the
changes
that
could
be
made
in
the
positions
of
a
a
cat
a
dog
a
cup
and
a
brahmin
on
the
mantelpiece
lord
colambre
as
diligently
reading
the
newspaper
my
dear
colambre
said
lady
clonbrony
down
the
paper
and
listen
to
me
let
me
entreat
you
not
to
neglect
miss
broadhurst
as
i
know
that
the
family
come
here
chiefly
on
your
account
dear
mother
i
never
can
neglect
any
deserving
young
lady
and
particularly
one
of
your
guests
but
i
shall
be
careful
not
to
do
more
than
not
to
neglect
for
i
never
will
pretend
what
i
do
not
feel
my
dear
colambre
miss
broadhurst
is
everything
you
could
wish
except
being
a
beauty
madam
said
lord
colambre
fixing
his
eyes
on
grace
nugent
think
that
i
can
see
no
farther
than
a
handsome
face
the
unconscious
grace
nugent
now
made
a
warm
eulogium
of
miss
broadhurst
sense
and
wit
and
independence
of
character
did
not
know
that
miss
broadhurst
was
a
friend
of
yours
miss
nugent
is
i
assure
you
a
friend
of
mine
and
as
a
proof
i
will
not
praise
her
at
this
moment
i
will
go
farther
still
i
will
promise
that
i
never
will
praise
her
to
you
till
you
begin
to
praise
her
to
me
lord
colambre
smiled
and
now
listened
as
if
he
wished
that
grace
should
go
on
speaking
even
of
miss
broadhurst
my
sweet
grace
cried
lady
clonbrony
she
knows
how
to
manage
these
men
not
one
of
them
can
resist
her
lord
colambre
for
his
part
did
not
deny
the
truth
of
this
assertion
added
lady
clonbrony
him
promise
to
do
as
we
would
have
him
promises
are
dangerous
things
to
ask
or
to
give
said
grace
and
naughty
children
never
make
promises
especially
promises
to
be
good
without
longing
to
break
them
the
next
minute
at
least
child
persuade
him
i
charge
you
to
make
my
gala
go
off
well
that
the
first
thing
we
ought
to
think
of
now
ring
the
bell
and
all
heads
and
hands
i
put
in
requisition
for
the
gala
chapter
iii
the
opening
of
her
gala
the
display
of
her
splendid
the
turkish
tent
the
alhambra
the
pagoda
formed
a
proud
moment
to
lady
clonbrony
much
did
she
enjoy
and
much
too
naturally
notwithstanding
all
her
efforts
to
be
stiff
and
stately
much
too
naturally
did
she
show
her
enjoyment
of
the
surprise
excited
in
some
and
affected
by
others
on
their
first
entrance
one
young
very
young
lady
expressed
her
astonishment
so
audibly
as
to
attract
the
notice
of
all
the
bystanders
lady
clonbrony
delighted
seized
both
her
hands
shook
them
and
laughed
heartily
then
as
the
young
lady
with
her
party
passed
on
her
ladyship
recovered
herself
drew
up
her
head
and
said
to
the
company
near
her
thing
i
hope
i
covered
her
little
naivete
properly
how
new
she
must
be
then
with
dignity
and
of
aspect
her
ladyship
went
gliding
about
most
importantly
busy
introducing
my
lady
this
to
the
sphynx
candelabra
and
my
lady
that
to
the
trebisond
trellice
placing
some
delightfully
for
the
perspective
of
the
alhambra
establishing
others
quite
to
her
satisfaction
on
seraglio
ottomans
and
honouring
others
with
a
seat
under
the
statira
canopy
receiving
and
answering
compliments
from
successive
crowds
of
select
friends
imagining
herself
the
mirror
of
fashion
and
the
admiration
of
the
whole
world
lady
clonbrony
was
for
her
hour
as
happy
certainly
as
ever
woman
was
in
similar
circumstances
her
son
looked
at
her
and
wished
that
this
happiness
could
last
naturally
inclined
to
sympathy
lord
colambre
reproached
himself
for
not
feeling
as
gay
at
this
instant
as
the
occasion
required
but
the
festive
scene
the
blazing
lights
the
hubbub
failed
to
raise
his
spirits
as
a
dead
weight
upon
them
hung
the
remembrance
of
mordicai
denunciations
and
through
the
midst
of
this
eastern
magnificence
this
unbounded
profusion
he
thought
he
saw
future
domestic
misery
and
ruin
to
those
he
loved
best
in
the
world
the
only
object
present
on
which
his
eye
rested
with
pleasure
was
grace
nugent
beautiful
in
elegant
and
dignified
simplicity
thoughtless
of
herself
yet
with
a
look
of
thought
and
with
an
air
of
melancholy
which
accorded
exactly
with
his
own
feelings
and
which
he
believed
to
arise
from
the
same
reflections
that
had
passed
in
his
own
mind
broadhurst
colambre
all
the
broadhursts
said
his
mother
wakening
him
as
she
passed
by
to
receive
them
as
they
entered
miss
broadhurst
appeared
plainly
dressed
plainly
even
to
singularity
without
any
diamonds
or
ornament
philippa
to
you
my
dear
lady
clonbrony
this
figure
rather
than
not
bring
her
at
all
said
puffing
broadhurst
had
all
the
difficulty
in
the
world
to
get
her
out
at
all
and
now
i
promised
she
shall
stay
but
half
an
hour
sore
throat
terrible
cold
she
took
in
the
morning
i
swear
for
her
she
not
have
come
for
any
one
but
you
the
young
lady
did
not
seem
inclined
to
swear
or
even
to
say
this
for
herself
she
stood
wonderfully
unconcerned
and
passive
with
an
expression
of
humour
lurking
in
her
eyes
and
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
whilst
lady
clonbrony
was
and
and
and
and
whilst
everybody
was
hoping
and
fearing
and
busying
themselves
about
her
broadhurst
you
better
sit
here
for
heaven
sake
miss
broadhurst
not
there
broadhurst
if
you
take
my
opinion
and
broadhurst
if
i
may
advise
nugent
cried
lady
clonbrony
broadhurst
always
listens
to
you
do
my
dear
persuade
miss
broadhurst
to
take
care
of
herself
and
let
us
take
her
to
the
inner
little
pagoda
where
she
can
be
so
warm
and
so
retired
the
very
thing
for
an
invalid
colambre
pioneer
the
way
for
us
for
the
crowd
immense
lady
anne
and
lady
catharine
h
lady
langdale
daughters
were
at
this
time
leaning
on
miss
nugent
arm
and
moved
along
with
this
party
to
the
inner
pagoda
there
was
to
be
cards
in
one
room
music
in
another
dancing
in
a
third
and
in
this
little
room
there
were
prints
and
etc
you
will
be
quite
to
yourselves
said
lady
clonbrony
me
establish
you
comfortably
in
this
which
i
call
my
sanctuary
my
snuggery
colambre
that
little
table
miss
broadhurst
you
play
chess
colambre
you
play
with
miss
broadhurst
thank
your
ladyship
said
miss
broadhurst
i
know
nothing
of
chess
but
the
moves
lady
catharine
you
will
play
and
i
will
look
on
miss
broadhurst
drew
her
seat
to
the
fire
lady
catharine
sat
down
to
play
with
lord
colambre
lady
clonbrony
withdrew
again
recommending
miss
broadhurst
to
grace
nugent
care
after
some
commonplace
conversation
lady
anne
h
looking
at
the
company
in
the
adjoining
apartment
asked
her
sister
how
old
miss
somebody
was
who
passed
by
this
led
to
reflections
upon
the
comparative
age
and
youthful
appearance
of
several
of
their
acquaintance
and
upon
the
care
with
which
mothers
concealed
the
age
of
their
daughters
glances
passed
between
lady
catharine
and
lady
anne
my
part
said
miss
broadhurst
mother
would
that
point
of
secrecy
in
vain
for
me
for
i
am
willing
to
tell
my
age
even
if
my
face
did
not
tell
it
for
me
to
all
whom
it
may
concern
i
am
past
shall
be
the
of
next
july
bless
me
i
thought
you
were
not
twenty
cried
lady
anne
next
july
impossible
cried
lady
catharine
possible
said
miss
broadhurst
quite
unconcerned
lord
colambre
would
you
believe
it
can
you
believe
it
asked
lady
catharine
he
can
said
miss
broadhurst
you
see
that
he
believes
it
as
firmly
as
you
and
i
do
why
should
you
force
his
lordship
to
pay
a
compliment
contrary
to
his
better
judgment
or
to
extort
a
smile
from
him
under
false
pretences
i
am
sure
he
sees
that
you
ladies
and
i
trust
he
perceives
that
i
do
not
think
the
worse
of
him
for
this
lord
colambre
smiled
now
without
any
false
pretence
and
relieved
at
once
from
all
apprehension
of
her
joining
in
his
mother
views
or
of
her
expecting
particular
attention
from
him
he
became
at
ease
with
miss
broadhurst
shelved
a
desire
to
converse
with
her
and
listened
eagerly
to
what
she
said
he
recollected
that
grace
nugent
had
told
him
that
this
young
lady
had
no
common
character
and
neglecting
his
move
at
chess
he
looked
up
at
grace
as
much
as
to
say
her
out
pray
but
grace
was
too
good
a
friend
to
comply
with
that
request
she
left
miss
broadhurst
to
unfold
her
own
character
is
your
move
my
lord
said
lady
catharine
beg
your
ladyship
pardon
not
these
rooms
beautiful
miss
broadhurst
said
lady
catharine
determined
if
possible
to
turn
the
conversation
into
a
commonplace
safe
channel
for
she
had
just
felt
what
most
of
miss
broadhurst
acquaintance
had
in
their
turn
felt
that
she
had
an
odd
way
of
startling
people
by
setting
their
own
secret
little
motives
suddenly
before
them
not
these
rooms
beautiful
certainly
the
beauty
of
the
rooms
would
have
answered
lady
catharine
purpose
for
some
time
had
not
lady
anne
imprudently
brought
the
conversation
back
again
to
miss
broadhurst
you
know
miss
broadhurst
said
she
if
i
had
fifty
sore
throats
i
could
not
have
refrained
from
my
diamonds
on
this
gala
night
and
such
diamonds
as
you
have
now
really
i
could
not
believe
you
to
be
the
same
person
we
saw
blazing
at
the
opera
the
other
night
could
not
you
lady
anne
that
is
the
very
thing
that
entertains
me
i
only
wish
that
i
could
lay
aside
my
fortune
sometimes
as
well
as
my
diamonds
and
see
how
few
people
would
know
me
then
might
not
i
grace
by
the
golden
rule
which
next
to
practice
is
the
best
rule
in
the
world
calculate
and
answer
that
question
am
persuaded
said
lord
colambre
miss
broadhurst
has
friends
on
whom
the
experiment
would
make
no
difference
am
convinced
of
it
said
miss
broadhurst
that
is
what
makes
me
tolerably
happy
though
i
have
the
misfortune
to
be
an
heiress
is
the
oddest
speech
said
lady
anne
i
should
so
like
to
be
a
great
heiress
and
to
have
like
you
such
thousands
and
thousands
at
command
what
can
the
thousands
upon
thousands
do
for
me
hearts
you
know
lady
anne
are
to
be
won
only
by
radiant
eyes
bought
hearts
your
ladyship
certainly
would
not
recommend
they
such
poor
things
no
wear
at
all
turn
them
which
way
you
will
you
can
make
nothing
of
them
tried
then
have
you
said
lady
catharine
my
cost
very
nearly
taken
in
by
them
half
a
dozen
times
for
they
are
brought
to
me
by
dozens
and
they
are
so
made
up
for
sale
and
the
people
do
so
swear
to
you
that
it
real
real
love
and
it
looks
so
like
it
and
if
you
stoop
to
examine
it
you
hear
it
pressed
upon
you
by
such
elegant
oaths
by
all
that
lovely
by
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
by
your
own
charming
self
why
what
can
one
do
but
look
like
a
fool
and
believe
for
these
men
at
the
time
all
look
so
like
gentlemen
that
one
can
not
bring
oneself
flatly
to
tell
them
that
they
are
cheats
and
swindlers
that
they
are
perjuring
their
precious
souls
besides
to
call
a
lover
a
perjured
creature
is
to
encourage
him
he
would
have
a
right
to
complain
if
you
went
back
after
that
dear
what
a
move
was
there
cried
lady
catharine
broadhurst
is
so
entertaining
notwithstanding
her
sore
throat
that
one
can
positively
attend
to
nothing
else
and
she
talks
of
love
and
lovers
too
with
such
connaissance
de
fait
counts
her
lovers
by
dozens
tied
up
in
knots
no
no
did
i
say
lovers
suitors
i
should
have
said
there
nothing
less
like
a
lover
a
true
lover
than
a
suitor
as
all
the
world
knows
ever
since
the
days
of
penelope
dozens
never
had
a
lover
in
my
life
and
fear
with
much
reason
i
never
shall
have
one
to
my
mind
lord
you
given
up
the
game
cried
lady
catharine
you
make
no
battle
would
be
so
vain
to
combat
against
your
ladyship
said
lord
colambre
rising
and
bowing
politely
to
lady
catharine
but
turning
the
next
instant
to
converse
with
miss
broadhurst
but
when
i
talked
of
liking
to
be
an
heiress
said
lady
anne
was
not
thinking
of
lovers
one
is
not
always
thinking
of
lovers
you
know
added
lady
catharine
always
replied
miss
broadhurst
lovers
out
of
the
question
on
all
sides
what
would
your
ladyship
buy
with
the
thousands
upon
thousands
everything
if
i
were
you
said
lady
anne
to
begin
with
said
lady
catharine
my
old
objection
bought
rank
is
but
a
shabby
thing
there
is
so
little
difference
made
between
bought
and
hereditary
rank
in
these
days
said
lady
catharine
see
a
great
deal
still
said
miss
broadhurst
much
that
i
would
never
buy
a
title
title
without
birth
to
be
sure
said
lady
anne
not
be
so
well
worth
buying
and
as
birth
certainly
is
not
to
be
bought
even
birth
were
it
to
be
bought
i
would
not
buy
said
miss
broadhurst
i
could
be
sure
to
have
with
it
all
the
politeness
all
the
noble
sentiments
all
the
magnanimity
in
short
all
that
should
grace
and
dignify
high
birth
said
lord
colambre
grace
nugent
smiled
colambre
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
put
my
mother
in
mind
i
must
go
away
am
bound
to
obey
but
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
said
his
lordship
we
to
have
any
dancing
i
wonder
said
lady
catharine
nugent
i
am
afraid
we
have
made
miss
broadhurst
talk
so
much
in
spite
of
her
hoarseness
that
lady
clonbrony
will
be
quite
angry
with
us
and
here
she
comes
my
lady
clonbrony
came
to
hope
to
beg
that
miss
broadhurst
would
not
think
of
running
away
but
miss
broadhurst
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
stay
lady
clonbrony
was
delighted
to
see
that
her
son
assisted
grace
nugent
most
carefully
in
shawling
miss
broadhurst
his
lordship
conducted
her
to
her
carriage
and
his
mother
drew
many
happy
auguries
from
the
gallantry
of
his
manner
and
from
the
young
lady
having
stayed
instead
of
half
an
hour
a
circumstance
which
lady
catharine
did
not
fail
to
remark
the
dancing
which
under
various
pretences
lady
clonbrony
had
delayed
till
lord
colambre
was
at
liberty
began
immediately
after
miss
broadhurst
departure
and
the
chalked
mosaic
pavement
of
the
alhambra
was
in
a
few
minutes
effaced
by
the
dancers
feet
how
transient
are
all
human
joys
especially
those
of
vanity
even
on
this
long
meditated
this
long
desired
this
gala
night
lady
clonbrony
found
her
triumph
incomplete
inadequate
to
her
expectations
for
the
first
hour
all
had
been
compliment
success
and
smiles
presently
came
the
buts
and
the
hesitated
objections
and
the
with
faint
praise
all
that
could
be
borne
everybody
has
his
taste
and
one
person
taste
is
as
good
as
another
and
while
she
had
soho
to
cite
lady
clonbrony
thought
she
might
be
well
satisfied
but
she
could
not
be
satisfied
with
colonel
heathcock
who
dressed
in
black
had
stretched
his
length
of
limb
under
the
statira
canopy
upon
the
couch
when
after
having
monopolised
attention
and
been
the
subject
of
much
bad
wit
about
black
swans
and
rare
birds
and
swans
being
geese
and
geese
being
swans
the
colonel
condescended
to
rise
and
as
dareville
said
to
vacate
his
couch
that
couch
was
no
longer
white
the
black
impression
of
the
colonel
remained
on
the
sullied
snow
now
really
did
recollect
i
was
in
black
was
all
the
apology
he
made
lady
clonbrony
was
particularly
vexed
that
the
appearance
of
the
statira
canopy
should
be
spoiled
before
the
effect
had
been
seen
by
lady
pococke
and
lady
chatterton
and
lady
g
lady
p
and
the
duke
of
v
and
a
party
of
superlative
fashionables
who
had
promised
to
look
in
upon
her
but
who
late
as
it
was
had
not
yet
arrived
they
came
in
at
last
but
lady
clonbrony
had
no
reason
to
regret
for
their
sake
the
statira
couch
it
would
have
been
lost
upon
them
as
was
everything
else
which
she
had
prepared
with
so
much
pains
and
cost
to
excite
their
admiration
they
came
resolute
not
to
admire
skilled
in
the
art
of
making
others
unhappy
they
just
looked
round
with
an
air
of
apathy
you
had
soho
soho
has
done
wonders
for
you
here
vastly
well
vastly
well
soho
very
clever
in
his
way
others
of
great
importance
came
in
full
of
some
slight
accident
that
had
happened
to
themselves
or
their
horses
or
their
carriages
and
with
privileged
selfishness
engrossed
the
attention
of
all
within
their
sphere
of
conversation
well
lady
clonbrony
got
over
all
this
and
got
over
the
history
of
a
letter
about
a
chimney
that
was
on
fire
a
week
ago
at
the
duke
of
v
old
house
in
brecknockshire
in
gratitude
for
the
smiling
patience
with
which
she
listened
to
him
his
grace
of
v
fixed
his
glass
to
look
at
the
alhambra
and
had
just
pronounced
it
to
be
very
well
when
the
dowager
lady
chatterton
made
a
terrible
discovery
a
discovery
that
filled
lady
clonbrony
with
astonishment
and
indignation
soho
had
played
her
false
what
was
her
mortification
when
the
dowager
assured
her
that
these
identical
alhambra
hangings
had
not
only
been
shown
by
soho
to
the
duchess
of
torcaster
but
that
her
grace
had
had
the
refusal
of
them
and
had
actually
rejected
them
in
consequence
of
sir
horace
grant
the
great
traveller
objecting
to
some
of
the
proportions
of
the
pillars
soho
had
engaged
to
make
a
new
set
vastly
improved
by
sir
horace
suggestions
for
her
grace
of
torcaster
now
lady
chatterton
was
the
greatest
talker
extant
and
she
went
about
the
rooms
telling
everybody
of
her
acquaintance
and
she
was
acquainted
with
everybody
how
shamefully
soho
had
imposed
upon
poor
lady
clonbrony
protesting
she
could
not
forgive
the
man
said
she
though
the
duchess
of
torcaster
has
been
his
constant
customer
for
ages
and
his
patroness
and
all
that
yet
this
does
not
excuse
him
and
lady
clonbrony
being
a
stranger
and
from
ireland
makes
the
thing
worse
from
ireland
that
was
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
but
there
was
no
remedy
in
vain
poor
lady
clonbrony
followed
the
dowager
about
the
rooms
to
correct
this
mistake
and
to
represent
in
justice
to
soho
though
he
had
used
her
so
ill
that
he
knew
she
was
an
englishwoman
the
dowager
was
deaf
and
no
whisper
could
reach
her
ear
and
when
lady
clonbrony
was
obliged
to
bawl
an
explanation
in
her
car
the
dowager
only
repeated
justice
to
mr
soho
no
no
he
has
not
done
you
justice
my
dear
lady
clonbrony
and
i
expose
him
to
everybody
englishwoman
no
no
no
soho
could
not
take
you
for
an
englishwoman
all
who
secretly
envied
or
ridiculed
lady
clonbrony
enjoyed
this
scene
the
alhambra
hangings
which
had
been
in
one
short
hour
before
the
admiration
of
the
world
were
now
regarded
by
every
eye
with
contempt
as
cast
hangings
and
every
tongue
was
busy
declaiming
against
soho
everybody
declared
that
from
the
first
the
want
of
proportion
had
them
but
that
they
would
not
mention
it
till
others
found
it
out
people
usually
revenge
themselves
for
having
admired
too
much
by
afterwards
despising
and
depreciating
without
mercy
in
all
great
assemblies
the
perception
of
ridicule
is
quickly
caught
and
quickly
too
revealed
lady
clonbrony
even
in
her
own
house
on
her
gala
night
became
an
object
of
ridicule
decently
masked
indeed
under
the
appearance
of
condolence
with
her
ladyship
and
of
indignation
against
abominable
mr
soho
lady
langdale
who
was
now
for
reasons
of
her
own
upon
her
good
behaviour
did
penance
as
she
said
for
her
former
imprudence
by
abstaining
even
from
whispered
sarcasms
she
looked
on
with
penitential
gravity
said
nothing
herself
and
endeavoured
to
keep
dareville
in
order
but
that
was
no
easy
task
dareville
had
no
daughters
had
nothing
to
gain
from
the
acquaintance
of
my
lady
clonbrony
and
conscious
that
her
ladyship
would
bear
a
vast
deal
from
her
presence
rather
than
forego
the
honour
of
her
sanction
dareville
without
any
motives
of
interest
or
of
sufficient
power
to
restrain
her
talent
and
habit
of
ridicule
free
from
hope
or
fear
gave
full
scope
to
all
the
malice
of
mockery
and
all
the
insolence
of
fashion
her
slings
and
arrows
numerous
as
they
were
and
outrageous
were
directed
against
such
petty
objects
and
the
mischief
was
so
quick
in
its
aim
and
its
operation
that
felt
but
not
seen
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
register
the
hits
or
to
describe
the
nature
of
the
wounds
some
hits
sufficiently
palpable
however
were
recorded
for
the
advantage
of
posterity
when
lady
clonbrony
led
her
to
look
at
the
chinese
pagoda
the
lady
paused
with
her
foot
on
the
threshold
as
if
afraid
to
enter
this
porcelain
elysium
as
she
called
it
fool
paradise
she
would
have
said
and
by
her
hesitation
and
by
the
word
suggested
the
idea
but
belles
without
petticoats
can
enter
here
said
she
drawing
her
clothes
tight
round
her
i
have
but
two
and
lady
langdale
has
but
one
prevailed
upon
to
venture
in
she
walked
on
with
prodigious
care
and
trepidation
affecting
to
be
alarmed
at
the
crowd
of
strange
forms
and
monsters
by
which
she
was
surrounded
a
creature
here
that
i
ever
saw
before
in
nature
well
now
i
may
boast
i
been
in
a
real
chinese
pagoda
yes
everything
is
appropriate
here
i
flatter
myself
said
lady
clonbrony
how
good
of
you
my
dear
lady
clonbrony
in
defiance
of
bulls
and
blunders
to
allow
us
a
comfortable
english
fireplace
and
plenty
of
newcastle
coal
in
china
and
a
white
marble
no
white
velvet
hearthrug
painted
with
beautiful
flowers
oh
the
delicate
the
useful
thing
vexed
by
the
emphasis
on
the
word
useful
lady
clonbrony
endeavoured
to
turn
off
the
attention
of
the
company
langdale
your
ladyship
a
judge
of
china
this
vase
is
an
unique
i
am
told
am
told
interrupted
dareville
is
the
very
vase
in
which
b
the
nabob
father
who
was
you
know
a
china
captain
smuggled
his
dear
little
chinese
wife
and
all
her
fortune
out
of
canton
positively
actually
put
the
lid
on
packed
her
up
and
sent
her
off
on
shipboard
true
true
upon
my
veracity
i
tell
you
my
authority
with
this
story
dareville
drew
all
attention
from
the
jar
to
lady
clonbrony
infinite
mortification
lady
langdale
at
length
turned
to
look
at
a
vast
range
of
china
jars
baba
and
the
forty
thieves
exclaimed
dareville
hope
you
have
boiling
oil
ready
lady
clonbrony
was
obliged
to
laugh
and
to
vow
that
dareville
was
uncommon
pleasant
now
said
her
ladyship
me
take
you
on
to
the
turkish
tent
having
with
great
difficulty
got
the
malicious
wit
out
of
the
pagoda
and
into
the
turkish
tent
lady
clonbrony
began
to
breathe
more
freely
for
here
she
thought
she
was
upon
safe
ground
i
flatter
myself
said
she
correct
and
appropriate
and
quite
picturesque
the
company
dispersed
in
happy
groups
or
reposing
on
seraglio
ottomans
drinking
lemonade
and
sherbet
beautiful
fatimas
admiring
or
being
admired
here
quite
correct
appropriate
and
picturesque
repeated
dareville
this
lady
powers
as
a
mimic
were
extraordinary
and
she
found
them
irresistible
hitherto
she
had
imitated
lady
clonbrony
air
and
accent
only
behind
her
back
but
bolder
grown
she
now
ventured
in
spite
of
lady
langdale
warning
pinches
to
mimic
her
kind
hostess
before
her
face
and
to
her
face
now
whenever
lady
clonbrony
saw
anything
that
struck
her
fancy
in
the
dress
of
her
fashionable
friends
she
had
a
way
of
hanging
her
head
aside
and
saying
with
a
peculiar
sentimental
drawl
pretty
how
elegant
now
that
quite
suits
my
teeste
this
phrase
precisely
in
the
same
accent
and
with
the
head
set
to
the
same
angle
of
affectation
dareville
had
the
assurance
to
address
to
her
ladyship
apropos
to
something
which
she
pretended
to
admire
in
lady
clonbrony
costume
a
costume
which
excessively
fashionable
in
each
of
its
parts
was
all
together
so
extraordinarily
unbecoming
as
to
be
fit
for
a
the
perception
of
this
added
to
the
effect
of
dareville
mimicry
was
almost
too
much
for
lady
langdale
she
could
not
possibly
have
stood
it
but
for
the
appearance
of
miss
nugent
at
this
instant
behind
lady
clonbrony
grace
gave
one
glance
of
indignation
which
seemed
suddenly
to
strike
dareville
silence
for
a
moment
ensued
and
afterwards
the
tone
of
the
conversation
was
changed
explain
this
to
me
said
a
lady
drawing
salisbury
aside
you
are
in
the
secret
do
explain
this
to
me
for
unless
i
had
seen
it
i
could
not
have
believed
it
nay
though
i
have
seen
it
i
do
not
believe
it
how
was
that
daring
spirit
laid
by
what
spell
the
spell
which
superior
minds
always
cast
on
inferior
spirits
fine
said
the
lady
laughing
as
old
as
the
days
of
leonora
de
galigai
quoted
a
million
times
now
tell
me
something
new
and
to
the
purpose
and
better
suited
to
modern
days
then
since
you
will
not
allow
me
to
talk
of
superior
minds
in
the
present
days
let
me
ask
you
if
you
have
never
observed
that
a
wit
once
conquered
in
company
by
a
wit
of
a
higher
order
is
thenceforward
in
complete
subjection
to
the
conqueror
whenever
and
wherever
they
meet
would
not
persuade
me
that
yonder
girl
could
ever
be
a
match
for
the
veteran
dareville
she
may
have
the
wit
but
has
she
the
courage
no
one
has
more
courage
more
civil
courage
where
her
own
dignity
or
the
interests
of
her
friends
are
concerned
i
will
tell
you
an
instance
or
two
tell
it
me
now
a
safe
place
safest
in
the
world
in
such
a
crowd
as
this
follow
my
example
take
a
glass
of
orgeat
sip
from
time
to
time
thus
speak
low
looking
innocent
all
the
while
straight
forward
or
now
and
then
up
at
the
lamps
keep
on
in
an
even
tone
use
no
names
and
you
may
tell
anything
then
when
miss
nugent
first
came
to
london
lady
langdale
names
already
did
not
i
warn
ye
how
can
i
make
myself
intelligible
ca
you
use
or
genealogy
what
stops
you
is
only
lord
colambre
a
very
safe
person
i
have
a
notion
when
the
eulogium
is
of
grace
nugent
lord
colambre
who
had
now
performed
his
arduous
duties
as
a
dancer
and
had
disembarrassed
himself
of
all
his
partners
came
into
the
turkish
tent
just
at
this
moment
to
refresh
himself
and
just
in
time
to
hear
salisbury
anecdotes
go
on
langdale
you
know
sets
an
inordinate
value
upon
her
curtsies
in
public
and
she
used
to
treat
miss
nugent
as
her
ladyship
treats
many
other
people
sometimes
noticing
and
sometimes
pretending
not
to
know
her
according
to
the
company
she
happened
to
be
with
one
day
they
met
in
some
fine
company
lady
langdale
looked
as
if
she
was
afraid
of
committing
herself
by
a
curtsy
miss
nugent
waited
for
a
good
opportunity
and
when
all
the
world
was
silent
leant
forward
and
called
to
lady
langdale
as
if
she
had
something
to
communicate
of
the
greatest
consequence
skreening
her
whisper
with
her
hand
as
in
an
aside
on
the
stage
langdale
you
may
curtsy
to
me
now
nobody
is
looking
retort
courteous
said
lord
colambre
only
retort
for
a
woman
her
ladyship
deserved
it
so
well
but
dareville
what
happened
about
her
dareville
you
remember
some
years
ago
went
to
ireland
with
some
to
whom
she
was
related
there
she
was
most
hospitably
received
by
lord
and
lady
clonbrony
went
to
their
country
house
was
as
intimate
with
lady
clonbrony
and
with
miss
nugent
as
possible
stayed
at
clonbrony
castle
for
a
month
and
yet
when
lady
clonbrony
came
to
london
never
took
the
least
notice
of
her
at
last
meeting
at
the
house
of
a
common
friend
dareville
could
not
avoid
recognising
her
ladyship
but
even
then
did
it
in
the
least
civil
manner
and
most
cursory
style
possible
lady
clonbrony
did
know
you
were
in
england
when
did
you
come
how
long
shall
you
stay
in
town
hope
before
you
leave
england
your
ladyship
and
miss
nugent
will
give
us
a
day
a
day
lady
clonbrony
was
so
astonished
by
this
impudence
of
ingratitude
that
she
hesitated
how
to
take
it
but
miss
nugent
quite
coolly
and
with
a
smile
answered
day
certainly
to
you
who
gave
us
a
month
now
comprehend
perfectly
why
dareville
declines
insulting
miss
nugent
friends
in
her
presence
lord
colambre
said
nothing
but
thought
much
i
wish
my
mother
thought
he
some
of
grace
nugent
proper
pride
she
would
not
then
waste
her
fortune
spirits
health
and
life
in
courting
such
people
as
these
he
had
not
seen
he
could
not
have
borne
to
have
beheld
the
manner
in
which
his
mother
had
been
treated
by
some
of
her
guests
but
he
observed
that
she
now
looked
harassed
and
vexed
and
he
was
provoked
and
mortified
by
hearing
her
begging
and
beseeching
some
of
these
saucy
leaders
of
the
ton
to
oblige
her
to
do
her
the
favour
to
do
her
the
honour
to
stay
to
supper
it
was
just
ready
actually
announced
they
would
not
they
could
not
they
were
obliged
to
run
away
engaged
to
the
duchess
of
torcaster
colambre
what
is
the
matter
said
miss
nugent
going
up
to
him
as
he
stood
aloof
and
indignant
look
so
like
a
chafed
lion
others
may
perhaps
read
your
countenance
as
well
as
i
do
can
read
my
mind
so
well
replied
he
my
dear
grace
supper
cried
she
duty
to
your
neighbour
your
hand
to
your
partner
lady
catharine
as
they
went
downstairs
to
supper
observed
that
miss
nugent
had
not
been
dancing
that
she
had
kept
quite
in
the
background
all
night
quite
in
the
shade
said
lord
colambre
are
contented
in
the
shade
are
the
best
able
to
bear
the
light
and
i
am
not
surprised
that
one
so
interesting
in
the
background
should
not
desire
to
be
the
foremost
figure
in
a
piece
the
supper
room
fitted
up
at
great
expense
with
scenery
to
imitate
vauxhall
opened
into
a
superb
greenhouse
lighted
with
coloured
lamps
a
band
of
music
at
a
distance
every
delicacy
every
luxury
that
could
gratify
the
senses
appeared
in
profusion
the
company
ate
and
drank
enjoyed
themselves
went
away
and
laughed
at
their
hostess
some
indeed
who
thought
they
had
been
neglected
were
in
too
bad
humour
to
laugh
but
abused
her
in
sober
earnest
for
lady
clonbrony
had
offended
half
nay
of
her
guests
by
what
they
termed
her
exclusive
attention
to
those
very
leaders
of
the
ton
from
whom
she
had
suffered
so
much
and
who
had
made
it
obvious
to
all
that
they
thought
they
did
her
too
much
honour
in
appearing
at
her
gala
so
ended
the
gala
for
which
she
had
lavished
such
sums
for
which
she
had
laboured
so
indefatigably
and
from
which
she
had
expected
such
triumph
bid
the
musicians
stop
they
are
playing
to
empty
benches
said
lady
clonbrony
my
dear
will
you
see
that
these
lamps
are
safely
put
out
i
am
so
tired
so
worn
out
i
must
go
to
bed
and
i
am
sure
i
have
caught
cold
too
what
a
nervous
business
it
is
to
manage
these
things
i
wonder
how
one
gets
through
it
or
why
one
does
it
chapter
iv
lady
clonbrony
was
taken
ill
the
day
after
her
gala
she
had
caught
cold
by
standing
when
much
overheated
in
a
violent
draught
of
wind
paying
her
parting
compliments
to
the
duke
of
v
who
thought
her
a
bore
and
wished
her
in
heaven
all
the
time
for
keeping
his
horses
standing
her
ladyship
illness
was
severe
and
long
she
was
confined
to
her
room
for
some
weeks
by
a
rheumatic
fever
and
an
inflammation
in
her
eyes
every
day
when
lord
colambre
went
to
see
his
mother
he
found
miss
nugent
in
her
apartment
and
every
hour
he
found
fresh
reason
to
admire
this
charming
girl
the
affectionate
tenderness
the
indefatigable
patience
the
strong
attachment
she
showed
for
her
aunt
actually
raised
lady
clonbrony
in
her
son
opinion
he
was
persuaded
she
must
surely
have
some
good
or
great
qualities
or
she
could
not
have
excited
such
strong
affection
a
few
foibles
out
of
the
question
such
as
her
love
of
fine
people
her
affectation
of
being
english
and
other
affectations
too
tedious
to
mention
lady
clonbrony
was
really
a
good
woman
had
good
principles
moral
and
religious
and
selfishness
not
immediately
interfering
she
was
and
though
her
soul
and
attention
were
so
completely
absorbed
in
the
duties
of
acquaintanceship
that
she
did
not
know
it
she
really
had
affections
they
were
concentrated
upon
a
few
near
relations
she
was
extremely
fond
and
extremely
proud
of
her
son
next
to
her
son
she
was
fonder
of
her
niece
than
of
any
other
creature
she
had
received
grace
nugent
into
her
family
when
she
was
left
an
orphan
and
deserted
by
some
of
her
other
relations
she
had
bred
her
up
and
had
treated
her
with
constant
kindness
this
kindness
and
these
obligations
had
raised
the
warmest
gratitude
in
miss
nugent
heart
and
it
was
the
strong
principle
of
gratitude
which
rendered
her
capable
of
endurance
and
exertions
seemingly
far
above
her
strength
this
young
lady
was
not
of
a
robust
appearance
though
she
now
underwent
extraordinary
fatigue
her
aunt
could
scarcely
bear
that
she
should
leave
her
for
a
moment
she
could
not
close
her
eyes
unless
grace
sat
up
with
her
many
hours
every
night
night
after
night
she
bore
this
fatigue
and
yet
with
little
sleep
or
rest
she
preserved
her
health
at
least
supported
her
spirits
and
every
morning
when
lord
colambre
came
into
his
mother
room
he
saw
miss
nugent
look
as
blooming
as
if
she
had
enjoyed
the
most
refreshing
sleep
the
bloom
was
as
he
observed
not
permanent
it
came
and
went
with
every
emotion
of
her
feeling
heart
and
he
soon
learned
to
fancy
her
almost
as
handsome
when
she
was
pale
as
when
she
had
a
colour
he
had
thought
her
beautiful
when
he
beheld
her
in
all
the
radiance
of
light
and
with
all
the
advantages
of
dress
at
the
gala
but
he
found
her
infinitely
more
lovely
and
interesting
now
when
he
saw
her
in
a
a
chamber
where
often
he
could
but
just
discern
her
form
or
distinguish
her
except
by
her
graceful
motion
as
she
passed
or
when
but
for
a
moment
a
drawn
aside
let
the
sun
shine
upon
her
face
or
on
the
unadorned
ringlets
of
her
hair
much
must
be
allowed
for
an
inflammation
in
the
eyes
and
something
for
a
rheumatic
fever
yet
it
may
seem
strange
that
lady
clonbrony
should
be
so
blind
and
deaf
as
neither
to
see
nor
hear
all
this
time
that
having
lived
so
long
in
the
world
it
should
never
occur
to
her
that
it
was
rather
imprudent
to
have
a
young
lady
not
eighteen
nursing
her
and
such
a
young
lady
when
her
son
not
and
such
a
son
came
to
visit
her
daily
but
so
it
was
lady
clonbrony
knew
nothing
of
love
she
had
read
of
it
indeed
in
novels
which
sometimes
for
fashion
sake
she
had
looked
at
and
over
which
she
had
been
obliged
to
doze
but
this
was
only
love
in
books
love
in
real
life
she
had
never
met
with
in
the
life
she
led
how
should
she
she
had
heard
of
its
making
young
people
and
old
people
even
do
foolish
things
but
those
were
foolish
people
and
if
they
were
worse
than
foolish
why
it
was
shocking
and
nobody
visited
them
but
lady
clonbrony
had
not
for
her
own
part
the
slightest
notion
how
people
could
be
brought
to
this
pass
nor
how
anybody
out
of
bedlam
could
prefer
to
a
good
house
a
decent
equipage
and
a
proper
establishment
what
is
called
love
in
a
cottage
as
to
colambre
she
had
too
good
an
opinion
of
his
understanding
to
say
nothing
of
his
duty
to
his
family
his
pride
his
rank
and
his
being
her
son
to
let
such
an
idea
cross
her
imagination
as
to
her
niece
in
the
first
place
she
was
her
niece
and
first
cousins
should
never
marry
because
they
form
no
new
connexions
to
strengthen
the
family
interest
or
raise
its
consequence
this
doctrine
her
ladyship
had
repeated
for
years
so
often
and
so
dogmatically
that
she
conceived
it
to
be
incontrovertible
and
of
as
full
force
as
any
law
of
the
land
or
as
any
moral
or
religious
obligation
she
would
as
soon
have
suspected
her
niece
of
an
intention
of
stealing
her
diamond
necklace
as
of
purloining
colambre
heart
or
marrying
this
heir
of
the
house
of
clonbrony
miss
nugent
was
so
well
apprised
and
so
thoroughly
convinced
of
all
this
that
she
never
for
one
moment
allowed
herself
to
think
of
lord
colambre
as
a
lover
duty
honour
and
gratitude
gratitude
the
strong
feeling
and
principle
of
her
mind
forbade
it
she
had
so
prepared
and
habituated
herself
to
consider
him
as
a
person
with
whom
she
could
not
possibly
be
united
that
with
perfect
ease
and
simplicity
she
behaved
towards
him
exactly
as
if
he
was
her
brother
not
in
the
equivocating
sentimental
romance
style
in
which
ladies
talk
of
treating
men
as
their
brothers
whom
they
are
all
the
time
secretly
thinking
of
and
endeavouring
to
please
as
lovers
not
using
this
phrase
as
a
convenient
pretence
a
safe
mode
of
securing
herself
from
suspicion
or
scandal
and
of
enjoying
the
advantages
of
confidence
and
the
intimacy
of
friendship
till
the
propitious
moment
when
it
should
be
time
to
declare
or
avow
the
secret
of
the
heart
no
this
young
lady
was
quite
above
all
she
had
no
mental
reservation
no
metaphysical
subtleties
but
with
plain
unsophisticated
morality
in
good
faith
and
simple
truth
acted
as
she
professed
thought
what
she
said
and
was
that
which
she
seemed
to
be
as
soon
as
lady
clonbrony
was
able
to
see
anybody
her
niece
sent
to
broadhurst
who
was
very
intimate
with
the
family
she
used
to
come
frequently
almost
every
evening
to
sit
with
the
invalid
miss
broadhurst
accompanied
her
mother
for
she
did
not
like
to
go
out
with
any
other
chaperon
it
was
disagreeable
to
spend
her
time
alone
at
home
and
most
agreeable
to
spend
it
with
her
friend
miss
nugent
in
this
she
had
no
design
no
coquetry
miss
broadhurst
had
too
lofty
and
independent
a
spirit
to
stoop
to
coquetry
she
thought
that
in
their
interview
at
the
gala
she
understood
lord
colambre
and
that
he
understood
her
that
he
was
not
inclined
to
court
her
for
her
fortune
that
she
would
not
be
content
with
any
suitor
who
was
not
a
lover
she
was
two
or
three
years
older
than
lord
colambre
perfectly
aware
of
her
want
of
beauty
yet
with
a
just
sense
of
her
own
merit
and
of
what
was
becoming
and
due
to
the
dignity
of
her
sex
this
she
trusted
was
visible
in
her
manners
and
established
in
lord
colambre
mind
so
that
she
ran
no
risk
of
being
misunderstood
by
him
and
as
to
what
the
rest
of
the
world
thought
she
was
so
well
used
to
hear
weekly
and
daily
reports
of
her
going
to
be
married
to
fifty
different
people
that
she
cared
little
for
what
was
said
on
this
subject
indeed
conscious
of
rectitude
and
with
an
utter
contempt
for
mean
and
commonplace
gossiping
she
was
for
a
woman
and
a
young
woman
rather
too
disdainful
of
the
opinion
of
the
world
broadhurst
though
her
daughter
had
fully
explained
herself
respecting
lord
colambre
before
she
began
this
course
of
visiting
yet
rejoiced
that
even
on
this
footing
there
should
be
constant
intercourse
between
them
it
was
broadhurst
warmest
wish
that
her
daughter
should
obtain
rank
and
connect
herself
with
an
ancient
family
she
was
sensible
that
the
young
lady
being
older
than
the
gentleman
might
be
an
obstacle
and
very
sorry
she
was
to
find
that
her
daughter
had
so
imprudently
so
unnecessarily
declared
her
age
but
still
this
little
obstacle
might
be
overcome
much
greater
difficulties
in
the
marriage
of
inferior
heiresses
were
every
day
got
over
and
thought
nothing
of
then
as
to
the
young
lady
own
sentiments
her
mother
knew
them
better
than
she
did
herself
she
understood
her
daughter
pride
that
she
dreaded
to
be
made
an
object
of
bargain
and
sale
but
broadhurst
who
with
all
her
coarseness
of
mind
had
rather
a
better
notion
of
love
matters
than
lady
clonbrony
perceived
through
her
daughter
horror
of
being
offered
to
lord
colambre
through
her
anxiety
that
nothing
approaching
to
an
advance
on
the
part
of
her
family
should
be
made
that
if
lord
colambre
should
himself
advance
he
would
stand
a
better
chance
of
being
accepted
than
any
other
of
the
numerous
persons
who
had
yet
aspired
to
the
favour
of
this
heiress
the
very
circumstance
of
his
having
paid
no
court
to
her
at
first
operated
in
his
favour
for
it
proved
that
he
was
not
mercenary
and
that
whatever
attention
he
might
afterwards
show
she
must
be
sure
would
be
sincere
and
disinterested
now
let
them
but
see
one
another
in
this
easy
intimate
kind
of
way
and
you
will
find
my
dear
lady
clonbrony
things
will
go
on
of
their
own
accord
all
the
better
for
our
minding
our
cards
and
never
minding
anything
else
i
remember
when
i
was
young
but
let
that
pass
let
the
young
people
see
one
another
and
manage
their
own
affairs
their
own
way
let
them
be
together
that
all
i
say
ask
half
the
men
you
are
acquainted
with
why
they
married
and
their
answer
if
they
speak
truth
will
be
because
i
met
miss
at
such
a
place
and
we
were
continually
together
propinquity
propinquity
as
my
father
used
to
say
and
he
was
married
five
times
and
twice
to
heiresses
in
consequence
of
this
plan
of
leaving
things
to
themselves
every
evening
lady
clonbrony
made
out
her
own
little
with
broadhurst
and
a
and
miss
pratt
a
brother
and
sister
who
were
the
most
obliging
convenient
neighbours
imaginable
from
time
to
time
as
lady
clonbrony
gathered
up
her
cards
she
would
direct
an
inquiring
glance
to
the
group
of
young
people
at
the
other
table
whilst
the
more
prudent
broadhurst
sat
plump
with
her
back
to
them
pursing
up
her
lips
and
contracting
her
brows
in
token
of
deep
calculation
looking
down
impenetrable
at
her
cards
never
even
noticing
lady
clonbrony
glances
but
inquiring
from
her
partner
many
they
were
by
honours
the
young
party
generally
consisted
of
miss
broadhurst
lord
colambre
miss
nugent
and
her
admirer
salisbury
salisbury
was
a
gentleman
very
agreeable
and
well
informed
he
had
travelled
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
had
lived
in
the
best
company
had
acquired
what
is
called
good
tact
was
full
of
anecdote
not
mere
gossiping
anecdotes
that
lead
to
nothing
but
anecdotes
characteristic
of
national
manners
of
human
nature
in
general
or
of
those
illustrious
individuals
who
excite
public
curiosity
and
interest
miss
nugent
had
seen
him
always
in
large
companies
where
he
was
admired
for
his
and
for
his
entertaining
anecdotes
but
where
he
had
no
opportunity
of
producing
any
of
the
higher
powers
of
his
understanding
or
showing
character
she
found
that
salisbury
appeared
to
her
quite
a
different
person
when
conversing
with
lord
colambre
lord
colambre
with
that
ardent
thirst
for
knowledge
which
it
is
always
agreeable
to
gratify
had
an
air
of
openness
and
generosity
a
frankness
a
warmth
of
manner
which
with
good
breeding
but
with
something
beyond
it
and
superior
to
its
established
forms
irresistibly
won
the
confidence
and
attracted
the
affection
of
those
with
whom
he
conversed
his
manners
were
peculiarly
agreeable
to
a
person
like
salisbury
tired
of
the
sameness
and
egotism
of
men
of
the
world
miss
nugent
had
seldom
till
now
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
much
conversation
on
literary
subjects
in
the
life
she
had
been
compelled
to
lead
she
had
acquired
accomplishments
had
exercised
her
understanding
upon
everything
that
passed
before
her
and
from
circumstances
had
formed
her
judgment
and
her
taste
by
observations
on
real
life
but
the
ample
page
of
knowledge
had
never
been
unrolled
to
her
eyes
she
had
never
had
opportunities
of
acquiring
literature
herself
but
she
admired
it
in
others
particularly
in
her
friend
miss
broadhurst
miss
broadhurst
had
received
all
the
advantages
of
education
which
money
could
procure
and
had
profited
by
them
in
a
manner
uncommon
among
those
for
whom
they
are
purchased
in
such
abundance
she
not
only
had
had
many
masters
and
read
many
books
but
had
thought
of
what
she
read
and
had
supplied
by
the
strength
and
energy
of
her
own
mind
what
can
not
be
acquired
by
the
assistance
of
masters
miss
nugent
perhaps
overvaluing
the
information
that
she
did
not
possess
and
free
from
all
idea
of
envy
looked
up
to
her
friend
as
to
a
superior
being
with
a
sort
of
enthusiastic
admiration
and
now
with
attention
listened
by
turns
to
her
to
salisbury
and
to
lord
colambre
whilst
they
conversed
on
literary
subjects
listened
with
a
countenance
so
full
of
intelligence
of
animation
so
expressive
of
every
good
and
kind
affection
that
the
gentlemen
did
not
always
know
what
they
were
saying
go
on
said
she
once
to
salisbury
stop
perhaps
from
politeness
to
me
from
compassion
to
my
ignorance
but
though
i
am
ignorant
you
do
not
tire
me
i
assure
you
did
you
ever
condescend
to
read
the
arabian
tales
like
him
whose
eyes
were
touched
by
the
magical
application
from
the
dervise
i
am
enabled
at
once
to
see
the
riches
of
a
new
world
oh
how
unlike
how
superior
to
that
in
which
i
have
lived
the
great
world
as
it
is
called
lord
colambre
brought
down
a
beautiful
edition
of
the
arabian
tales
looked
for
the
story
to
which
miss
nugent
had
alluded
and
showed
it
to
miss
broadhurst
who
was
also
searching
for
it
in
another
volume
lady
clonbrony
from
her
saw
the
young
people
thus
engaged
profess
not
to
understand
these
things
so
well
as
you
say
you
do
my
dear
broadhurst
whispered
she
look
there
now
they
are
at
their
books
what
do
you
expect
can
come
of
that
sort
of
thing
so
and
downright
rude
of
colambre
i
must
give
him
a
hint
no
for
mercy
sake
my
dear
lady
clonbrony
no
hints
no
hints
no
remarks
what
would
you
have
she
reading
and
my
lord
at
the
back
of
her
chair
leaning
over
and
allowed
mind
to
lean
over
to
read
the
same
thing
ca
be
better
never
saw
any
man
yet
allowed
to
come
so
near
her
now
lady
clonbrony
not
a
word
not
a
look
i
beseech
well
but
if
they
had
a
little
music
daughter
tired
of
music
how
much
do
i
owe
your
ladyship
now
three
rubbers
i
think
now
though
you
would
not
believe
it
of
a
young
girl
continued
broadhurst
can
assure
your
ladyship
my
daughter
would
often
rather
go
to
a
book
than
a
ball
now
that
very
extraordinary
in
the
style
in
which
she
has
been
brought
up
yet
books
and
all
that
are
so
fashionable
now
that
it
very
natural
said
lady
clonbrony
about
this
time
berryl
lord
colambre
cambridge
friend
for
whom
his
lordship
had
fought
the
battle
of
the
curricle
with
mordicai
came
to
town
lord
colambre
introduced
him
to
his
mother
by
whom
he
was
graciously
received
for
berryl
was
a
young
gentleman
of
good
figure
good
address
good
family
heir
to
a
good
fortune
and
in
every
respect
a
fit
match
for
miss
nugent
lady
clonbrony
thought
that
it
would
be
wise
to
secure
him
for
her
niece
before
he
should
make
his
appearance
in
the
london
world
where
mothers
and
daughters
would
soon
make
him
feel
his
own
consequence
berryl
as
lord
colambre
intimate
friend
was
admitted
to
the
private
evening
parties
at
lady
clonbrony
and
he
contributed
to
render
them
still
more
agreeable
his
information
his
habits
of
thinking
and
his
views
were
all
totally
different
from
salisbury
and
their
collision
continually
struck
out
that
sparkling
novelty
which
pleases
peculiarly
in
conversation
berryl
education
disposition
and
tastes
fitted
him
exactly
for
the
station
which
he
was
destined
to
fill
in
society
that
of
a
country
gentleman
not
meaning
by
that
expression
a
mere
eating
drinking
hunting
shooting
ignorant
country
squire
of
the
old
race
which
is
now
nearly
extinct
but
a
cultivated
enlightened
independent
english
country
gentleman
the
happiest
perhaps
of
human
beings
on
the
comparative
felicity
of
the
town
and
country
life
on
the
dignity
utility
elegance
and
interesting
nature
of
their
different
occupations
and
general
scheme
of
passing
their
time
berryl
and
salisbury
had
one
evening
a
playful
entertaining
and
perhaps
instructive
conversation
each
party
at
the
end
remaining
as
frequently
happens
of
their
own
opinion
it
was
observed
that
miss
broadhurst
ably
and
warmly
defended
berryl
side
of
the
question
and
in
their
views
plans
and
estimates
of
life
there
appeared
a
remarkable
and
as
lord
colambre
thought
a
happy
coincidence
when
she
was
at
last
called
upon
to
give
her
decisive
judgment
between
a
town
and
a
country
life
she
declared
that
she
were
condemned
to
the
extremes
of
either
she
should
prefer
a
country
life
as
much
as
she
should
prefer
robinson
crusoe
diary
to
the
journal
of
the
idle
man
in
the
spectator
bless
me
broadhurst
do
you
hear
what
your
daughter
is
saying
cried
lady
clonbrony
who
from
the
lent
an
attentive
ear
to
all
that
was
going
forward
it
possible
that
miss
broadhurst
with
her
fortune
and
pretensions
and
sense
can
really
be
serious
in
saying
she
would
be
content
to
live
in
the
country
that
you
say
child
about
living
in
the
country
said
broadhurst
miss
broadhurst
repeated
what
she
had
said
always
think
so
who
have
lived
in
town
said
broadhurst
are
always
dreaming
of
sheep
and
sheephooks
but
the
first
winter
the
country
cures
them
a
shepherdess
in
winter
is
a
sad
and
sorry
sort
of
personage
except
at
a
masquerade
said
lady
clonbrony
am
sure
miss
broadhurst
sentiments
about
town
life
and
all
that
must
delight
you
for
do
you
know
he
is
always
trying
to
persuade
me
to
give
up
living
in
town
colambre
and
miss
broadhurst
perfectly
agree
your
cards
my
dear
lady
clonbrony
interrupted
broadhurst
pity
to
your
partner
pratt
has
certainly
the
patience
of
job
your
ladyship
has
revoked
twice
this
hand
lady
clonbrony
begged
a
thousand
pardons
fixed
her
eyes
and
endeavoured
to
fix
her
mind
on
the
cards
but
there
was
something
said
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
about
an
estate
in
cambridgeshire
which
soon
distracted
her
attention
again
pratt
certainly
had
the
patience
of
job
she
revoked
and
lost
the
game
though
they
had
four
by
honours
as
soon
as
she
rose
from
the
and
could
speak
to
broadhurst
apart
she
communicated
her
apprehensions
my
dear
madam
said
she
believe
i
have
done
very
wrong
to
admit
berryl
just
now
though
it
was
on
grace
account
i
did
it
but
i
did
not
know
miss
broadhurst
had
an
estate
in
cambridgeshire
their
two
estates
just
close
to
one
another
i
heard
them
say
lord
bless
me
there
the
danger
of
propinquity
indeed
danger
no
danger
persisted
broadhurst
know
my
girl
better
than
you
do
begging
your
ladyship
pardon
no
one
thinks
less
of
estates
than
she
does
i
only
know
i
heard
her
talking
of
them
and
earnestly
too
very
likely
but
do
you
know
that
girls
never
think
of
what
they
are
talking
about
or
rather
never
talk
of
what
they
are
thinking
about
and
they
have
always
ten
times
more
to
say
to
the
man
they
do
care
for
than
to
him
they
do
extraordinary
said
lady
clonbrony
only
hope
you
are
right
am
sure
of
it
said
broadhurst
let
things
go
on
and
mind
your
cards
i
beseech
you
night
better
than
you
did
and
you
will
see
that
things
will
turn
out
just
as
i
prophesied
lord
colambre
will
come
to
a
proposal
before
the
end
of
the
week
and
will
be
accepted
or
my
name
not
broadhurst
why
in
plain
english
i
am
clear
my
girl
likes
him
and
when
that
the
case
you
know
can
you
doubt
how
the
thing
will
end
broadhurst
was
perfectly
right
in
every
point
of
her
reasoning
but
one
from
long
habit
of
seeing
and
considering
that
such
an
heiress
as
her
daughter
might
marry
whom
she
pleased
from
constantly
seeing
that
she
was
the
person
to
decide
and
to
reject
broadhurst
had
literally
taken
it
for
granted
that
everything
was
to
depend
upon
her
daughter
inclinations
she
was
not
mistaken
in
the
present
case
in
opining
that
the
young
lady
would
not
be
averse
to
lord
colambre
if
he
came
to
what
she
called
a
proposal
it
really
never
occurred
to
broadhurst
that
any
man
whom
her
daughter
was
the
least
inclined
to
favour
could
think
of
anybody
else
in
these
affairs
as
the
matron
thought
herself
she
saw
but
one
side
of
the
question
blind
and
dull
of
comprehension
as
she
thought
lady
clonbrony
on
this
subject
she
was
herself
so
completely
blinded
by
her
own
prejudices
as
to
be
incapable
of
discerning
the
plain
thing
that
was
before
her
eyes
videlicet
that
lord
colambre
preferred
grace
nugent
lord
colambre
made
no
proposal
before
the
end
of
the
week
but
this
broadhurst
attributed
to
an
unexpected
occurrence
which
prevented
things
from
going
on
in
the
train
in
which
they
had
been
proceeding
so
smoothly
sir
john
berryl
berryl
father
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
dangerous
illness
the
news
was
brought
to
berryl
one
evening
whilst
he
was
at
lady
clonbrony
the
circumstances
of
domestic
distress
which
afterwards
occurred
in
the
family
of
his
friend
entirely
occupied
lord
colambre
time
and
attention
all
thoughts
of
love
were
suspended
and
his
whole
mind
was
given
up
to
the
active
services
of
friendship
the
sudden
illness
of
sir
john
berryl
spread
an
alarm
among
his
creditors
which
brought
to
light
at
once
the
disorder
of
his
affairs
of
which
his
son
had
no
knowledge
or
suspicion
lady
berryl
had
been
a
very
expensive
woman
especially
in
equipages
and
mordicai
the
coachmaker
appeared
at
this
time
the
foremost
and
the
most
inexorable
of
their
creditors
conscious
that
the
charges
in
his
account
were
exorbitant
and
that
they
would
not
be
allowed
if
examined
by
a
court
of
justice
that
it
was
a
debt
which
only
ignorance
and
extravagance
could
have
in
the
first
instance
incurred
swelled
afterwards
to
an
amazing
amount
by
interest
and
interest
upon
interest
mordicai
was
impatient
to
obtain
payment
whilst
sir
john
yet
lived
or
at
least
to
obtain
legal
security
for
the
whole
sum
from
the
heir
berryl
offered
his
bond
for
the
amount
of
the
reasonable
charges
in
his
account
but
this
mordicai
absolutely
refused
declaring
that
now
he
had
the
power
in
his
own
hands
he
would
use
it
to
obtain
the
utmost
penny
of
his
debt
that
he
would
not
let
the
thing
slip
through
his
fingers
that
a
debtor
never
yet
escaped
him
and
never
should
that
a
man
lying
upon
his
deathbed
was
no
excuse
to
a
creditor
that
he
was
not
a
whiffler
to
stand
upon
ceremony
about
disturbing
a
gentleman
in
his
last
moments
that
he
was
not
to
be
cheated
out
of
his
due
by
such
niceties
that
he
was
prepared
to
go
all
lengths
the
law
would
allow
for
that
as
to
what
people
said
of
him
he
did
not
care
a
doit
your
face
with
your
hands
if
you
like
it
berryl
you
may
be
ashamed
for
me
but
i
feel
no
shame
for
myself
i
am
not
so
weak
mordicai
countenance
said
more
than
his
words
livid
with
malice
and
with
atrocious
determination
in
his
eyes
he
stood
sir
said
he
may
look
at
me
as
you
please
it
is
possible
i
am
in
earnest
consult
what
you
do
now
behind
my
back
or
before
my
face
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
for
nothing
will
do
but
my
money
or
your
bond
berryl
the
arrest
is
made
on
the
person
of
your
father
luckily
made
while
the
breath
is
still
in
the
body
yes

forward
to
strike
me
if
you
dare
your
father
sir
john
berryl
sick
or
well

my
prisoner
lady
berryl
and
berryl
sisters
in
an
agony
of
grief
rushed
into
the
room
all
useless
cried
mordicai
turning
his
back
upon
the
ladies
tricks
upon
creditors
wo
do
with
me
i
used
to
these
scenes
i
not
made
of
such
stuff
as
you
think
leave
a
gentleman
in
peace
in
his
last
moments
no
he
ought
not
nor
sha
die
in
peace
if
he
do
pay
his
debts
and
if
you
are
all
so
mighty
sorry
ladies
there
the
gentleman
you
may
kneel
to
if
tenderness
is
the
order
of
the
day
it
for
the
son
to
show
it
not
me
ay
now
berryl
cried
he
as
berryl
took
up
the
bond
to
sign
it
beginning
to
know
i
not
a
fool
to
be
trifled
with
stop
your
hand
if
you
choose
it
sir
it
all
the
same
to
me
the
person
or
the
money
i
carry
with
me
out
of
this
house
beryl
signed
the
bond
and
threw
it
to
him
monster
quit
the
house
is
not
actionable
i
wish
you
had
called
me
rascal
said
mordicai
grinning
a
horrible
smile
and
taking
up
the
bond
deliberately
returned
it
to
berryl
paper
is
worth
nothing
to
me
sir
it
is
not
witnessed
berryl
hastily
left
the
room
and
returned
with
lord
colambre
mordicai
changed
countenance
and
grew
pale
for
a
moment
at
sight
of
lord
colambre
my
lord
since
it
so
happens
i
am
not
sorry
that
you
should
be
witness
to
this
paper
said
he
indeed
not
sorry
that
you
should
witness
the
whole
proceeding
for
i
trust
i
shall
be
able
to
explain
to
you
my
conduct
do
not
come
here
sir
interrupted
lord
colambre
listen
to
any
explanations
of
your
conduct
which
i
perfectly
understand
i
come
to
witness
a
bond
for
my
friend
berryl
if
you
think
proper
to
extort
from
him
such
a
bond
extort
nothing
my
lord
berryl
it
is
quite
a
voluntary
act
take
notice
on
your
part
sign
or
not
witness
or
not
as
you
please
gentlemen
said
mordicai
sticking
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
recovering
his
look
of
black
and
fixed
determination
it
witness
it
my
dear
lord
said
berryl
looking
at
his
mother
and
weeping
sisters
it
quick
berryl
must
just
run
over
his
name
again
in
your
presence
my
lord
with
a
dry
pen
said
mordicai
putting
the
pen
into
berryl
hand
sir
said
lord
colambre
friend
shall
never
sign
it
you
please
my
lord
the
bond
or
the
body
before
i
quit
this
house
said
mordicai
sir
shall
you
have
and
you
quit
this
house
directly
how
my
lord
how
this
the
arrest
you
have
made
is
as
illegal
as
it
is
inhuman
my
lord
said
mordicai
startled
sir
i
came
into
this
house
at
the
moment
when
your
bailiff
asked
and
was
refused
admittance
afterwards
in
the
confusion
of
the
family
above
stairs
he
forced
open
the
house
door
with
an
iron
bar
i
saw
him
i
am
ready
to
give
evidence
of
the
fact
now
proceed
at
your
peril
mordicai
without
reply
snatched
up
his
hat
and
walked
towards
the
door
but
lord
colambre
held
the
door
open
the
door
was
immediately
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
mordicai
seeing
his
indignant
look
and
proud
form
hesitated
to
pass
for
he
had
always
heard
that
irishmen
are
in
the
executive
part
of
justice
on
sir
repeated
lord
colambre
with
an
air
of
ineffable
contempt
am
a
gentleman
you
have
nothing
to
fear
mordicai
ran
downstairs
lord
colambre
before
he
went
back
into
the
room
waited
to
see
mordicai
and
his
bailiff
out
of
the
house
when
mordicai
was
fairly
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
turned
and
white
with
rage
looked
up
at
lord
colambre
begins
at
home
my
lord
said
he
at
home
you
shall
pay
for
this
added
he
standing
by
the
house
door
for
lord
colambre
moved
forward
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
i
give
you
this
warning
because
i
know
it
will
be
of
no
use
to
you
your
most
obedient
my
lord
the
house
door
closed
after
mordicai
heaven
thought
lord
colambre
i
did
not
horsewhip
that
mean
wretch
this
warning
shall
be
of
use
to
me
but
it
is
not
time
to
think
of
that
yet
lord
colambre
turned
from
his
own
affairs
to
those
of
his
friend
to
offer
all
the
assistance
and
consolation
in
his
power
sir
john
berryl
died
that
night
his
daughters
who
had
lived
in
the
highest
style
in
london
were
left
totally
unprovided
for
his
widow
had
mortgaged
her
jointure
berryl
had
an
estate
now
left
to
him
but
without
any
income
he
could
not
be
so
dishonest
as
to
refuse
to
pay
his
father
just
debts
he
could
not
let
his
mother
and
sisters
starve
the
scene
of
distress
to
which
lord
colambre
was
witness
in
this
family
made
a
still
greater
impression
upon
him
than
had
been
made
by
the
warning
or
the
threats
of
mordicai
the
similarity
between
the
circumstances
of
his
friend
family
and
of
his
own
struck
him
forcibly
all
this
evil
had
arisen
from
lady
berryl
passion
for
living
in
london
and
at
she
had
made
her
husband
an
absentee
an
absentee
from
his
home
his
affairs
his
duties
and
his
estate
the
sea
the
irish
channel
did
not
indeed
flow
between
him
and
his
estate
but
it
was
of
little
importance
whether
the
separation
was
effected
by
land
or
water
the
consequences
the
negligence
the
extravagance
were
the
same
of
the
few
people
of
his
age
who
are
capable
of
profiting
by
the
experience
of
others
lord
colambre
was
one
as
an
elegant
writer
has
observed
an
article
that
may
be
borrowed
with
safety
and
is
often
dearly
bought
chapter
v
in
the
meantime
lady
clonbrony
had
been
occupied
with
thoughts
very
different
from
those
which
passed
in
the
mind
of
her
son
though
she
had
never
completely
recovered
from
her
rheumatic
pains
she
had
become
inordinately
impatient
of
confinement
to
her
own
house
and
weary
of
those
dull
evenings
at
home
which
had
in
her
son
absence
become
insupportable
she
told
over
her
visiting
tickets
regularly
twice
a
day
and
gave
to
every
card
of
invitation
a
heartfelt
sigh
miss
pratt
alarmed
her
ladyship
by
bringing
intelligence
of
some
parties
given
by
persons
of
consequence
to
which
she
was
not
invited
she
feared
that
she
should
be
forgotten
in
the
world
well
knowing
how
soon
the
world
forgets
those
they
do
not
see
every
day
and
everywhere
how
miserable
is
the
fine
lady
lot
who
can
not
forget
the
world
and
who
is
forgot
by
the
world
in
a
moment
how
much
more
miserable
still
is
the
condition
of
a
fine
lady
working
her
way
up
in
the
world
with
care
and
pains
by
her
every
the
slightest
failure
of
attention
from
persons
of
rank
and
fashion
is
marked
and
felt
with
jealous
anxiety
and
with
a
sense
of
mortification
the
most
acute
an
invitation
omitted
is
a
matter
of
the
most
serious
consequence
not
only
as
it
regards
the
present
but
the
future
for
if
she
be
not
invited
by
lady
a
it
will
lower
her
in
the
eyes
of
lady
b
and
of
all
the
ladies
of
the
alphabet
it
will
form
a
precedent
of
the
most
dangerous
and
inevitable
application
if
she
has
nine
invitations
and
the
tenth
be
wanting
the
nine
have
no
power
to
make
her
happy
this
was
precisely
lady
clonbrony
case
there
was
to
be
a
party
at
lady
james
for
which
lady
clonbrony
had
no
card
ungrateful
so
monstrous
of
lady
st
james
what
was
the
gala
so
soon
forgotten
and
all
the
marked
attentions
paid
that
night
to
lady
st
james
attentions
you
know
pratt
which
were
looked
upon
with
a
jealous
eye
and
made
me
enemies
enough
i
am
told
in
another
quarter
of
all
people
i
did
not
expect
to
be
slighted
by
lady
st
james
miss
pratt
who
was
ever
ready
to
undertake
the
defence
of
any
person
who
had
a
title
pleaded
in
mitigation
of
censure
that
perhaps
lady
james
might
not
be
aware
that
her
ladyship
was
yet
well
enough
to
venture
out
my
dear
miss
pratt
that
can
not
be
the
thing
for
in
spite
of
my
rheumatism
which
really
was
bad
enough
last
sunday
i
went
on
purpose
to
the
royal
chapel
to
show
myself
in
the
closet
and
knelt
close
to
her
ladyship
and
my
dear
we
curtsied
and
she
congratulated
me
after
church
upon
my
being
abroad
again
and
was
so
happy
to
see
me
look
so
well
and
all
that
oh
it
is
something
very
extraordinary
and
unaccountable
i
daresay
a
card
will
come
yet
said
miss
pratt
upon
this
hint
lady
clonbrony
hope
revived
and
staying
her
anger
she
began
to
consider
how
she
could
manage
to
get
herself
invited
refreshing
tickets
were
left
next
morning
at
lady
james
with
their
corners
properly
turned
up
to
do
the
thing
better
separate
tickets
for
herself
and
for
miss
nugent
were
left
for
each
member
of
the
family
and
her
civil
messages
left
with
the
footman
extended
to
the
utmost
possibility
of
remainder
it
had
occurred
to
her
ladyship
that
for
miss
somebody
the
companion
of
whom
she
had
never
in
her
life
thought
before
she
had
omitted
to
leave
a
card
last
time
and
she
now
left
a
note
of
explanation
she
further
with
her
rheumatic
head
and
arm
out
of
the
sat
the
wind
blowing
keen
upon
her
explaining
to
the
porter
and
the
footman
to
discover
whether
her
former
tickets
had
gone
safely
up
to
lady
james
and
on
the
present
occasion
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
she
slid
handsome
expedition
money
into
the
servant
hand
you
will
be
sure
to
remember
certainly
your
ladyship
she
well
knew
what
dire
offence
has
frequently
been
taken
what
sad
disasters
have
occurred
in
the
fashionable
world
from
the
neglect
of
a
porter
in
delivering
or
of
a
footman
in
carrying
up
one
of
those
talismanic
cards
but
in
spite
of
all
her
manoeuvres
no
invitation
to
the
party
arrived
next
day
pratt
was
next
set
to
work
miss
pratt
was
a
most
convenient
who
in
consequence
of
doing
a
thousand
little
services
to
which
few
others
of
her
rank
in
life
would
stoop
had
obtained
the
entree
to
a
number
of
great
houses
and
was
behind
the
scenes
in
many
fashionable
families
pratt
could
find
out
and
pratt
could
hint
and
pratt
could
manage
to
get
things
done
cleverly
and
hints
were
given
in
all
directions
to
work
round
to
lady
james
but
still
they
did
not
take
effect
at
last
pratt
suggested
that
perhaps
though
everything
else
had
failed
dried
salmon
might
be
tried
with
success
lord
clonbrony
had
just
had
some
uncommonly
good
from
ireland
which
pratt
knew
lady
james
would
like
to
have
at
her
supper
because
a
certain
personage
whom
she
would
not
name
was
particularly
fond
of
wheel
within
wheel
in
the
fine
world
as
well
as
in
the
political
world
bribes
for
all
occasions
and
for
all
ranks
the
timely
present
was
sent
accepted
with
many
thanks
and
understood
as
it
was
meant
per
favour
of
this
propitiatory
offering
and
of
a
promise
of
half
a
dozen
pair
of
real
limerick
gloves
to
miss
pratt
a
promise
which
pratt
clearly
comprehended
to
be
a
conditional
promise
the
grand
object
was
at
length
accomplished
the
very
day
before
the
party
was
to
take
place
came
cards
of
invitation
to
lady
clonbrony
and
to
miss
nugent
with
lady
james
apologies
her
ladyship
was
concerned
to
find
that
by
some
negligence
of
her
servants
these
cards
were
not
sent
in
proper
time
slight
an
apology
will
do
from
some
people
thought
miss
nugent
eager
to
forgive
when
it
is
for
our
interest
or
our
pleasure
how
well
people
act
the
being
deceived
even
when
all
parties
know
that
they
see
the
whole
truth
and
how
low
pride
will
stoop
to
gain
its
object
ashamed
of
the
whole
transaction
miss
nugent
earnestly
wished
that
a
refusal
should
be
sent
and
reminded
her
aunt
of
her
rheumatism
but
rheumatism
and
all
other
objections
were
overruled
lady
clonbrony
would
go
it
was
just
when
this
affair
was
thus
in
her
opinion
successfully
settled
that
lord
colambre
came
in
with
a
countenance
of
unusual
seriousness
his
mind
full
of
the
melancholy
scenes
he
had
witnessed
in
his
friend
family
is
the
matter
colambre
he
related
what
had
passed
he
described
the
brutal
conduct
of
mordicai
the
anguish
of
the
mother
and
sisters
the
distress
of
berryl
tears
rolled
down
miss
nugent
cheeks
lady
clonbrony
declared
it
was
very
shocking
listened
with
attention
to
all
the
particulars
but
never
failed
to
correct
her
son
whenever
he
said
berryl
arthur
berryl
you
mean
she
was
however
really
touched
with
compassion
when
he
spoke
of
lady
berryl
destitute
condition
and
her
son
was
going
on
to
repeat
what
mordicai
had
said
to
him
but
lady
clonbrony
interrupted
my
dear
colambre
do
repeat
that
detestable
man
impertinent
speeches
to
me
if
there
is
anything
really
about
business
speak
to
your
father
at
any
rate
do
tell
us
of
it
now
because
i
a
hundred
things
to
do
said
her
ladyship
hurrying
out
of
the
room
grace
nugent
i
want
you
lord
colambre
sighed
deeply
despair
said
miss
nugent
as
she
followed
to
obey
her
aunt
summons
despair
do
attempt
to
speak
to
her
again
till
morning
her
head
is
now
full
of
lady
james
party
when
it
is
emptied
of
that
you
will
have
a
better
chance
never
despair
while
you
encourage
me
to
hope
that
any
good
can
be
done
lady
clonbrony
was
particularly
glad
that
she
had
carried
her
point
about
this
party
at
lady
james
because
from
the
first
private
intimation
that
the
duchess
of
torcaster
was
to
be
there
her
ladyship
flattered
herself
that
the
introduction
might
then
be
accomplished
but
of
this
hope
lady
james
had
likewise
received
intimation
from
the
miss
pratt
and
a
warning
note
was
despatched
to
the
duchess
to
let
her
grace
know
that
circumstances
had
occurred
which
had
rendered
it
impossible
not
to
ask
the
clonbronies
an
excuse
of
course
for
not
going
to
this
party
was
sent
by
the
duchess
her
grace
did
not
like
large
parties
she
would
have
the
pleasure
of
accepting
lady
james
invitation
for
her
select
party
on
wednesday
the
into
these
select
parties
lady
clonbrony
had
never
been
admitted
in
return
for
her
great
entertainments
she
was
invited
to
great
entertainments
to
large
parties
but
farther
she
could
never
penetrate
at
lady
st
james
and
with
her
set
lady
clonbrony
suffered
a
different
kind
of
mortification
from
that
which
lady
langdale
and
dareville
made
her
endure
she
was
safe
from
the
witty
raillery
the
sly
innuendo
the
insolent
mimicry
but
she
was
kept
at
a
cold
impassable
distance
by
ceremony
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
farther
was
expressed
in
every
look
in
every
word
and
in
a
thousand
different
ways
by
the
most
punctilious
respect
and
nice
regard
to
precedency
even
by
words
of
courtesy
ladyship
does
me
honour
lady
james
contrived
to
mortify
and
to
mark
the
difference
between
those
with
whom
she
was
and
with
whom
she
was
not
upon
terms
of
intimacy
and
equality
thus
the
ancient
grandees
of
spain
drew
a
line
of
demarcation
between
themselves
and
the
nobility
whenever
or
wherever
they
met
they
treated
the
new
nobles
with
the
utmost
respect
never
addressed
them
but
with
all
their
titles
with
low
bows
and
with
all
the
appearance
of
being
with
the
most
perfect
consideration
anything
but
their
equals
whilst
towards
one
another
the
grandees
laid
aside
their
state
and
omitting
their
titles
it
was
and
a
freedom
and
familiarity
which
marked
equality
entrenched
in
etiquette
in
this
manner
and
mocked
with
marks
of
respect
it
was
impossible
either
to
intrude
or
to
complain
of
being
excluded
at
supper
at
lady
james
lady
clonbrony
present
was
pronounced
by
some
gentleman
to
be
remarkably
high
flavoured
this
observation
turned
the
conversation
to
irish
commodities
and
ireland
lady
clonbrony
possessed
by
the
idea
that
it
was
disadvantageous
to
appear
as
an
irishwoman
or
as
a
favourer
of
ireland
began
to
be
embarrassed
by
lady
james
repeated
thanks
had
it
been
in
her
power
to
offer
anything
else
with
propriety
she
would
not
have
thought
of
sending
her
ladyship
anything
from
ireland
vexed
by
the
questions
that
were
asked
her
about
her
country
lady
clonbrony
as
usual
denied
it
to
be
her
country
and
went
on
to
depreciate
and
abuse
everything
irish
to
declare
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
living
in
ireland
and
that
for
her
own
part
she
was
resolved
never
to
return
thither
lady
james
preserving
perfect
silence
let
her
go
on
lady
clonbrony
imagining
that
this
silence
arose
from
coincidence
of
opinion
proceeded
with
all
the
eloquence
she
possessed
which
was
very
little
repeating
the
same
exclamations
and
reiterating
her
vow
of
perpetual
expatriation
till
at
last
an
elderly
lady
who
was
a
stranger
to
her
and
whom
she
had
till
this
moment
scarcely
noticed
took
up
the
defence
of
ireland
with
much
warmth
and
energy
the
eloquence
with
which
she
spoke
and
the
respect
with
which
she
was
heard
astonished
lady
clonbrony
is
she
whispered
her
ladyship
not
your
ladyship
know
lady
oranmore
the
irish
lady
oranmore
bless
me
what
have
i
said
what
have
i
done
oh
why
did
not
you
give
me
a
hint
lady
st
james
was
not
aware
that
your
ladyship
was
not
acquainted
with
lady
oranmore
replied
lady
james
unmoved
by
her
distress
everybody
sympathised
with
lady
oranmore
and
admired
the
honest
zeal
with
which
she
abided
by
her
country
and
defended
it
against
unjust
aspersions
and
affected
execrations
every
one
present
enjoyed
lady
clonbrony
confusion
except
miss
nugent
who
sat
with
her
eyes
bowed
down
by
penetrative
shame
during
the
whole
of
this
scene
she
was
glad
that
lord
colambre
was
not
witness
to
it
and
comforted
herself
with
the
hope
that
upon
the
whole
lady
clonbrony
would
be
benefited
by
the
pain
she
had
felt
this
instance
might
convince
her
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
deny
her
country
to
be
received
in
any
company
in
england
and
that
those
who
have
the
courage
and
steadiness
to
be
themselves
and
to
support
what
they
feel
and
believe
to
be
the
truth
must
command
respect
miss
nugent
hoped
that
in
consequence
of
this
conviction
lady
clonbrony
would
lay
aside
the
little
affectations
by
which
her
manners
were
painfully
constrained
and
ridiculous
and
above
all
she
hoped
that
what
lady
oranmore
had
said
of
ireland
might
dispose
her
aunt
to
listen
with
patience
to
all
lord
colambre
might
urge
in
favour
of
returning
to
her
home
but
miss
nugent
hoped
in
vain
lady
clonbrony
never
in
her
life
generalised
any
observations
or
drew
any
but
a
partial
conclusion
from
the
most
striking
facts
my
dear
grace
said
she
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
in
their
carriage
a
scrape
i
got
into
at
supper
and
what
disgrace
i
came
to
and
all
this
because
i
did
not
know
lady
oranmore
now
you
see
the
inconceivable
disadvantage
of
not
knowing
everybody
everybody
of
a
certain
rank
of
course
i
mean
miss
nugent
endeavoured
to
slide
in
her
own
moral
on
the
occasion
but
it
would
not
do
my
dear
lady
oranmore
may
talk
in
that
kind
of
style
of
ireland
because
on
the
other
hand
she
is
so
highly
connected
in
england
and
besides
she
is
an
old
lady
and
may
take
liberties
in
short
she
is
lady
oranmore
and
that
enough
the
next
morning
when
they
all
met
at
breakfast
lady
clonbrony
complained
bitterly
of
her
increased
rheumatism
of
the
disagreeable
stupid
party
they
had
had
the
preceding
night
and
of
the
necessity
of
going
to
another
formal
party
that
night
the
next
and
the
next
and
in
the
true
fine
lady
style
deplored
her
situation
and
the
impossibility
of
avoiding
those
things
which
felt
they
curse
yet
covet
still
to
br
miss
nugent
determined
to
retire
as
soon
as
she
could
from
the
to
leave
lord
colambre
an
opportunity
of
talking
over
his
family
affairs
at
full
liberty
she
knew
by
the
seriousness
of
his
countenance
that
his
mind
was
intent
upon
doing
so
and
she
hoped
that
his
influence
with
his
father
and
mother
would
not
be
exerted
in
vain
but
just
as
she
was
rising
from
the
in
came
sir
terence
and
seating
himself
quite
at
his
ease
in
spite
of
lady
clonbrony
repulsive
looks
his
awe
of
lord
colambre
having
now
worn
off
tired
said
he
have
a
right
to
be
tired
for
it
no
small
walk
i
taken
for
the
good
of
this
noble
family
this
morning
and
miss
nugent
before
i
say
more
i
take
a
cup
of
ta
from
you
if
you
please
lady
clonbrony
rose
with
great
stateliness
and
walked
to
the
farthest
end
of
the
room
where
she
established
herself
at
her
and
began
to
write
notes
sir
terence
wiped
his
forehead
deliberately
i
had
a
fine
run
miss
nugent
i
believe
you
never
saw
me
run
but
i
can
run
i
promise
you
when
it
to
serve
a
friend
and
my
lord
turning
to
lord
clonbrony
what
do
you
think
i
run
for
this
morning
to
buy
a
bargain
and
of
what
a
bargain
of
a
bad
debt
a
debt
of
yours
which
i
bargained
for
and
up
just
in
time
and
mordicai
ready
to
hang
himself
this
minute
for
what
do
you
think
but
that
rascal
was
bringing
upon
you
but
an
execution
he
was
execution
repeated
everybody
present
except
lord
colambre
how
has
this
been
prevented
sir
said
lord
colambre
let
me
alone
for
that
said
sir
terence
got
a
hint
from
my
little
friend
paddy
brady
who
would
not
be
paid
for
it
either
though
he
as
poor
as
a
rat
well
as
soon
as
i
got
the
hint
i
dropped
the
thing
i
had
in
my
hand
which
was
the
dublin
evening
and
ran
for
the
bare
life
for
there
was
a
coach
in
my
slippers
as
i
was
to
get
into
the
prior
creditor
shoes
who
is
the
little
solicitor
that
lives
in
crutched
friars
which
mordicai
never
dreamt
of
luckily
so
he
was
very
genteel
though
he
was
taken
on
a
sudden
and
from
his
breakfast
which
an
englishman
do
like
particularly
i
popped
him
a
douceur
of
a
draught
at
days
on
garraghty
the
agent
of
which
he
must
get
notice
but
i
wo
descant
on
the
law
before
the
ladies
he
handed
me
over
his
debt
and
execution
and
he
made
me
prior
creditor
in
a
trice
then
i
took
coach
in
state
the
first
i
met
and
away
with
me
to
long
acre
saw
mordicai
sir
says
i
i
hear
you
meditating
an
execution
on
a
friend
of
mine
am
i
said
the
rascal
who
told
you
so
no
matter
said
i
but
i
just
called
in
to
let
you
know
there
no
use
in
life
of
your
execution
for
there
a
prior
creditor
with
his
execution
to
be
satisfied
first
so
he
made
a
great
many
black
faces
and
said
a
great
deal
which
i
never
listened
to
but
came
off
here
clean
to
tell
you
all
the
story
one
word
of
which
do
i
understand
said
lady
clonbrony
my
dear
you
are
very
ungrateful
said
lord
clonbrony
lord
colambre
said
nothing
for
he
wished
to
learn
more
of
sir
terence
character
of
the
state
of
his
father
affairs
and
of
the
family
methods
of
proceeding
in
matters
of
business
terry
i
know
i
very
thankful
to
you
but
an
execution
an
ugly
thing
and
i
hope
there
no
danger
fear
said
sir
terence
i
been
at
my
wits
ends
for
myself
or
my
friends
ever
since
i
come
to
man
estate
to
years
of
discretion
i
should
say
for
the
deuce
a
foot
of
estate
have
i
but
use
has
sharpened
my
wits
pretty
well
for
your
service
so
never
be
in
dread
my
good
lord
for
look
ye
cried
the
reckless
knight
sticking
his
arms
akimbo
ye
here
in
sir
terence
stands
a
host
that
desires
no
better
than
to
encounter
single
witted
all
the
duns
in
the
united
kingdoms
mordicai
the
jew
inclusive
that
the
devil
that
mordicai
said
lord
clonbrony
the
only
man
an
earth
i
dread
he
is
only
a
coachmaker
is
not
he
said
lady
clonbrony
ca
think
how
you
can
talk
my
lord
of
dreading
such
a
low
man
tell
him
if
he
troublesome
we
wo
bespeak
any
more
carriages
and
i
sure
i
wish
you
would
not
be
so
silly
my
lord
to
employ
him
any
more
when
you
know
he
disappointed
me
the
last
birthday
about
the
landau
which
i
have
not
got
yet
my
dear
said
lord
clonbrony
do
know
what
you
are
talking
of
terry
i
say
even
a
friendly
execution
is
an
ugly
thing
phoo
an
ugly
thing
so
is
a
fit
of
the
gout
but
one
all
the
better
for
it
after
is
just
a
renewal
of
life
my
lord
for
which
one
must
pay
a
bit
of
a
fine
you
know
take
patience
and
leave
me
to
manage
all
properly
you
know
i
used
to
these
things
only
you
recollect
if
you
please
how
i
managed
my
friend
lord
it
bad
to
be
mentioning
names
but
lord
did
i
bring
him
through
cleverly
when
there
was
that
rascally
attempt
to
seize
the
family
plate
i
had
notice
and
what
did
i
do
but
broke
open
a
partition
between
that
lord
house
and
my
lodgings
which
i
had
taken
next
door
and
so
when
the
sheriff
officers
were
searching
below
on
the
ground
floor
i
just
shoved
the
plate
easy
through
to
my
bedchamber
at
a
moment
warning
and
then
bid
the
gentlemen
walk
in
for
they
could
set
a
foot
in
my
paradise
the
devils
so
they
stood
looking
at
it
through
the
wall
and
cursing
me
and
i
holding
both
my
sides
with
laughter
at
their
fallen
faces
sir
terence
and
lord
clonbrony
laughed
in
concert

a
good
story
said
miss
nugent
smiling
surely
sir
terence
such
things
are
never
done
in
real
life
ay
are
they
and
i
could
tell
you
a
hundred
better
strokes
my
dear
miss
nugent
cried
lady
clonbrony
pray
have
the
goodness
to
seal
and
send
these
notes
for
really
whispered
she
as
her
niece
came
to
the
table
cawnt
stee
i
cawnt
bear
that
man
vice
his
accent
grows
horrider
and
horrider
her
ladyship
rose
and
left
the
room
then
continued
sir
terence
following
up
miss
nugent
to
the
table
where
she
was
sealing
letters
must
tell
you
how
i
sarved
that
same
man
on
another
occasion
and
got
the
victory
too
no
general
officer
could
talk
of
his
victories
or
fight
his
battles
again
with
more
complacency
than
sir
terence
recounted
his
civil
exploits
i
tell
miss
nugent
there
was
a
footman
in
the
family
not
an
irishman
but
one
of
your
powdered
english
scoundrels
that
ladies
are
so
fond
of
having
hanging
to
the
backs
of
their
carriages
one
fleming
he
was
that
turned
spy
and
traitor
and
informer
went
privately
and
gave
notice
to
the
creditors
where
the
plate
was
hid
in
the
thickness
of
the
chimney
but
if
he
did
what
happened
why
i
had
my
an
honest
little
irish
boy
in
the
creditor
shop
that
i
had
secured
with
a
little
douceur
of
usquebaugh
and
he
outwitted
as
was
natural
the
english
lying
valet
and
gave
us
notice
just
in
the
nick
and
i
got
ready
for
their
reception
and
miss
nugent
i
only
wish
you
seen
the
excellent
sport
we
had
letting
them
follow
the
scent
they
got
and
when
they
were
sure
of
their
game
what
did
they
find
ha
ha
ha
dragged
out
after
a
world
of
labour
a
heavy
box
of
a
load
of
brickbats
not
an
item
of
my
friend
plate
that
was
all
snug
in
the
where
them
dunces
never
thought
of
looking
for
it
ha
ha
ha
come
terry
cried
lord
clonbrony
pull
down
your
pride
how
finely
another
time
your
job
of
the
false
ceiling
answered
in
the
hall
i
heard
that
story
and
have
been
told
how
the
sheriffs
fellow
thrust
his
bayonet
up
through
your
false
plaster
and
down
came
tumbling
the
family
plate
hey
terry
that
hit
cost
your
friend
lord
more
than
your
head
worth
terry
ask
your
pardon
my
lord
it
never
cost
him
a
farthing
he
paid
for
the
plate
to
redeem
it
and
did
not
i
make
up
for
that
at
the
races
of
the
creditors
learned
that
my
lord
horse
naboclish
was
to
run
at
races
and
as
the
sheriff
officer
knew
he
dare
not
touch
him
on
the
what
does
he
do
but
he
comes
down
early
in
the
morning
on
the
and
walks
straight
down
to
the
livery
stables
he
had
an
exact
description
of
the
stables
and
the
stall
and
the
horse
was
there
seeing
the
horse
taken
care
of
and
knowing
the
cut
of
the
fellow
jib
what
does
i
do
but
whips
the
off
naboclish
and
claps
them
upon
a
garrone
that
the
priest
would
not
ride
comes
the
bailiff
good
morrow
to
you
sir
says
i
leading
out
of
the
stable
my
lord

with
an
ould
saddle
and
bridle

i
to
the
groom
who
was
rubbing
down
the
garrone
heels

your
hits
and
wet
the
plate
not
so
fast
neither
says
the
bailiff
here
my
writ
for
seizing
the
horse
och
says
i
you
would
be
so
cruel
that
all
my
eye
says
he
seizing
the
garrone
while
i
mounted
naboclish
and
rode
him
off
deliberately
to
ha
ha
that
was
neat
i
grant
you
terry
said
lord
clonbrony
what
a
dolt
of
a
born
ignoramus
must
that
sheriffs
fellow
have
been
not
to
know
naboclish
when
he
saw
him
stay
my
lord
stay
miss
nugent
i
have
more
for
you
following
her
wherever
she
moved
did
not
let
him
off
so
even
at
the
cant
i
bid
and
bid
against
them
for
the
pretended
naboclish
till
i
left
him
on
their
hands
for
guineas
ha
ha
ha
was
not
that
famous
said
miss
nugent
can
not
believe
you
are
in
earnest
sir
terence
surely
this
would
be
out
with
it
my
dear
miss
nugent
am
afraid
of
offending
you
ca
my
dear
i
defy
you
say
the
word
that
came
to
the
tongue
end
it
always
the
best
was
going
to
say
swindling
said
the
young
lady
colouring
deeply
you
was
going
to
say
wrong
then
it
not
called
swindling
amongst
gentlemen
who
know
the
world
it
only
jockeying
fine
sport
and
very
honourable
to
help
a
friend
at
a
dead
lift
anything
to
get
a
friend
out
of
a
present
pressing
difficulty
when
the
present
difficulty
is
over
do
your
friends
never
think
of
the
future
future
leave
the
future
to
posterity
said
sir
terence
counsel
only
for
the
present
and
when
the
evil
comes
it
time
enough
to
think
of
it
i
ca
bring
the
guns
of
my
wits
to
bear
till
the
enemy
alongside
of
me
or
within
sight
of
me
at
the
least
and
besides
there
never
was
a
good
commander
yet
by
sea
or
land
that
would
tell
his
little
expedients
beforehand
or
before
the
very
day
of
battle
must
be
a
sad
thing
said
miss
nugent
sighing
deeply
be
reduced
to
live
by
little
expedients
daily
expedients
lord
colambre
struck
his
forehead
but
said
nothing
if
you
are
beating
your
brains
about
your
own
affairs
my
lord
colambre
my
dear
said
sir
terence
an
easy
way
of
settling
your
family
affairs
at
once
and
since
you
do
like
little
daily
expedients
miss
nugent
there
one
great
expedient
and
an
expedient
for
life
that
will
settle
it
all
to
your
satisfaction
and
ours
i
hinted
it
delicately
to
you
before
but
between
friends
delicacy
is
impertinent
so
i
tell
you
in
plain
english
you
nothing
to
do
but
go
and
propose
yourself
just
as
you
stand
to
the
heiress
miss
b
that
desires
no
better
cried
lord
colambre
stepping
forward
red
with
sudden
anger
miss
nugent
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
my
lord
terence
continued
lord
colambre
in
a
moderated
tone
are
wrong
to
mention
that
young
lady
name
in
such
a
manner
then
i
said
only
miss
b
and
there
are
a
whole
hive
of
bees
but
i
engage
she
thank
me
for
what
i
suggested
and
think
herself
the
queen
bee
if
my
expedient
was
adopted
by
you
terence
said
his
lordship
smiling
my
father
thinks
proper
that
you
should
manage
his
affairs
and
devise
expedients
for
him
i
have
nothing
to
say
on
that
point
but
i
must
beg
you
will
not
trouble
yourself
to
suggest
expedients
for
me
and
that
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
leave
me
to
settle
my
own
affairs
sir
terence
made
a
low
bow
and
was
silent
for
five
seconds
then
turning
to
lord
clonbrony
who
looked
much
more
abashed
than
he
did
the
wise
one
my
good
lord
i
believe
there
are
some
men
noblemen
too
that
do
know
their
friends
from
their
enemies
it
my
firm
persuasion
now
that
if
i
had
served
you
as
i
served
my
friend
i
was
talking
of
your
son
there
would
ten
to
one
think
i
had
done
him
an
injury
by
saving
the
family
plate
certainly
should
sir
the
family
plate
sir
is
not
the
first
object
in
my
mind
replied
lord
colambre
honour
nay
miss
nugent
i
must
speak
continued
his
lordship
perceiving
by
her
countenance
that
she
was
alarmed
fear
miss
nugent
dear
said
sir
terence
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
faith
then
my
lord
colambre
i
agree
with
you
that
family
honour
a
mighty
fine
thing
only
troublesome
to
one
self
and
one
friends
and
expensive
to
keep
up
with
all
the
other
expenses
and
debts
a
gentleman
has
nowadays
so
i
that
am
under
no
natural
obligations
to
it
by
birth
or
otherwise
have
just
stood
by
through
life
and
asked
myself
before
i
would
volunteer
being
bound
to
it
what
could
this
same
family
honour
do
for
a
man
in
this
world
and
first
and
foremost
i
never
remember
to
see
family
honour
stand
a
man
in
much
stead
in
a
court
of
law
never
saw
family
honour
stand
against
an
execution
or
a
custodiam
or
an
injunction
even
is
a
rare
thing
this
same
family
honour
and
a
very
fine
thing
but
i
never
knew
it
yet
at
a
pinch
pay
for
a
pair
of
boots
even
added
sir
terence
drawing
up
his
own
with
much
complacency
at
this
moment
sir
terence
was
called
out
of
the
room
by
one
who
wanted
to
speak
to
him
on
particular
business
dear
father
cried
lord
colambre
not
follow
him
stay
for
one
moment
and
hear
your
son
your
true
friend
miss
nugent
went
out
of
the
room
that
she
might
leave
the
father
and
son
at
liberty
your
natural
friend
for
one
moment
cried
lord
colambre
me
beseech
you
father
not
to
have
recourse
to
any
of
these
paltry
expedients
but
trust
your
son
with
the
state
of
your
affairs
and
we
shall
find
some
honourable
means
yes
yes
very
true
when
you
of
age
colambre
we
talk
of
it
but
nothing
can
be
done
till
then
we
shall
get
on
we
shall
get
through
very
well
till
then
with
terry
assistance
and
i
must
beg
you
will
not
say
a
word
more
against
terry
i
ca
bear
it
i
ca
hear
it
i
ca
do
without
him
pray
do
detain
me
i
can
say
no
more
except
added
he
returning
to
his
usual
concluding
sentence
there
need
at
all
events
be
none
of
this
if
people
would
but
live
upon
their
own
estates
and
kill
their
own
mutton
he
stole
out
of
the
room
glad
to
escape
however
shabbily
from
present
explanation
and
present
pain
there
are
persons
without
resource
who
in
difficulties
return
always
to
the
same
point
and
usually
to
the
same
words
while
lord
colambre
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
much
vexed
and
disappointed
at
finding
that
he
could
make
no
impression
on
his
father
mind
nor
obtain
his
confidence
as
to
his
family
affairs
lady
clonbrony
woman
petito
knocked
at
the
door
with
a
message
from
her
lady
to
beg
if
lord
colambre
was
by
himself
he
would
go
to
her
as
she
wished
to
have
a
conference
with
him
he
obeyed
her
summons
down
my
dear
colambre
and
she
began
precisely
with
her
old
sentence
the
fortune
i
brought
your
father
and
with
my
lord
estate
i
cawnt
understand
the
meaning
of
all
these
pecuniary
difficulties
and
all
that
strange
creature
sir
terence
says
is
algebra
to
me
who
speak
english
and
i
am
particularly
sorry
he
was
let
in
this
morning
but
he
such
a
brute
that
he
does
not
think
anything
of
forcing
one
door
and
he
tells
my
footman
he
does
not
mind
not
at
home
a
pinch
of
snuff
now
what
can
you
do
with
a
man
who
could
say
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
the
world
at
an
end
wish
my
father
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
as
much
as
you
can
wish
it
said
lord
colambre
i
have
said
all
that
a
son
can
with
propriety
say
and
without
effect
particularly
provokes
me
against
him
continued
lady
clonbrony
what
i
have
just
heard
from
grace
who
was
really
hurt
by
it
too
for
she
is
the
warmest
friend
in
the
world
i
allude
to
the
creature
indelicate
way
of
touching
upon
a
tender
pint
and
mentioning
an
amiable
young
heiress
name
my
dear
colambre
i
trust
you
have
given
me
credit
for
my
inviolable
silence
all
this
time
upon
the
pint
nearest
my
heart
i
am
rejoiced
to
hear
you
was
so
warm
when
she
was
mentioned
inadvertently
by
that
brute
and
i
trust
you
now
see
the
advantages
of
the
projected
union
in
as
strong
and
agreeable
a
pint
of
view
as
i
do
my
own
colambre
and
i
should
leave
things
to
themselves
and
let
you
prolong
the
dees
of
courtship
as
you
please
only
for
what
i
now
hear
incidentally
from
my
lord
and
the
brute
about
pecuniary
embarrassments
and
the
necessity
of
something
being
done
before
next
winter
and
indeed
i
think
now
in
propriety
the
proposal
can
not
be
delayed
much
longer
for
the
world
begins
to
talk
of
the
thing
as
done
and
even
broadhurst
i
know
had
no
doubt
that
if
this
contretemps
about
the
poor
berryls
had
not
occurred
your
proposal
would
have
been
made
before
the
end
of
last
week
our
hero
was
not
a
man
to
make
a
proposal
because
broadhurst
expected
it
or
to
marry
because
the
world
said
he
was
going
to
be
married
he
steadily
said
that
from
the
first
moment
the
subject
had
been
mentioned
he
had
explained
himself
distinctly
that
the
young
lady
friends
could
not
therefore
be
under
any
doubt
as
to
his
intentions
that
if
they
had
voluntarily
deceived
themselves
or
exposed
the
lady
in
situations
from
which
the
world
was
led
to
make
false
conclusions
he
was
not
answerable
he
felt
his
conscience
at
ease
entirely
so
as
he
was
convinced
that
the
young
lady
herself
for
whose
merit
talents
independence
and
generosity
of
character
he
professed
high
respect
esteem
and
admiration
had
no
doubts
either
of
the
extent
or
the
nature
of
his
regard
respect
esteem
admiration
why
my
dearest
colambre
this
is
saying
all
i
want
satisfies
me
and
i
am
sure
would
satisfy
mrs
broadhurst
and
miss
broadhurst
too
doubt
it
will
but
not
if
i
aspired
to
the
honour
of
miss
broadhurst
hand
or
professed
myself
her
lover
dear
you
are
mistaken
miss
broadhurst
is
too
sensible
a
girl
a
vast
deal
to
look
for
love
and
a
dying
lover
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff
i
am
persuaded
indeed
i
have
it
from
good
from
the
best
authority
that
the
young
lady
you
know
one
must
be
delicate
in
these
cases
where
a
young
lady
of
such
fortune
and
no
despicable
family
too
is
concerned
therefore
i
can
not
speak
quite
plainly
but
i
say
i
have
it
from
the
best
authority
that
you
would
be
preferred
to
any
other
suitor
and
in
short
that
beg
your
pardon
madam
for
interrupting
you
cried
lord
colambre
colouring
a
good
deal
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
say
that
the
only
authority
on
which
i
could
believe
this
is
one
from
which
i
am
morally
certain
i
shall
never
hear
it
from
miss
broadhurst
herself
child
if
you
would
only
ask
her
the
question
she
would
tell
you
it
is
truth
i
daresay
as
i
have
no
curiosity
on
the
subject
bless
me
i
thought
everybody
had
curiosity
but
still
without
curiosity
i
am
sure
it
would
gratify
you
when
you
did
hear
it
and
ca
you
just
put
the
simple
question
now
that
is
so
very
provoking
when
the
thing
is
all
but
done
well
take
your
own
time
all
i
will
ask
of
you
then
is
to
let
things
go
on
as
they
are
going
smoothly
and
pleasantly
and
i
not
press
you
farther
on
the
subject
at
present
let
things
go
on
smoothly
that
all
i
ask
and
say
nothing
wish
i
could
oblige
you
mother
but
i
can
not
do
this
since
you
tell
me
that
the
world
and
miss
broadhurst
friends
have
already
misunderstood
my
intentions
it
becomes
necessary
in
justice
to
the
young
lady
and
to
myself
that
i
should
make
all
further
doubt
impossible
i
shall
therefore
put
an
end
to
it
at
once
by
leaving
town
lady
clonbrony
breathless
for
a
moment
with
surprise
exclaimed
me
leave
town
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
impossible
i
never
saw
such
a
precipitate
rash
young
man
but
stay
only
a
few
weeks
colambre
the
physicians
advise
buxton
for
my
rheumatism
and
you
shall
take
us
to
buxton
early
in
the
season
you
can
not
refuse
me
that
why
if
miss
broadhurst
was
a
dragon
you
could
not
be
in
a
greater
hurry
to
run
away
from
her
what
are
you
afraid
of
doing
what
is
wrong
the
only
thing
i
trust
of
which
i
shall
ever
be
afraid
lady
clonbrony
tried
persuasion
and
argument
such
argument
as
she
could
use
but
all
in
vain
lord
colambre
was
firm
in
his
resolution
at
last
she
came
to
tears
and
her
son
in
much
agitation
said
can
not
bear
this
mother
i
would
do
anything
you
ask
that
i
could
do
with
honour
but
this
is
impossible
impossible
i
will
take
all
blame
upon
myself
and
you
are
sure
that
miss
broadhurst
does
not
misunderstand
you
and
you
esteem
her
and
admire
her
and
all
that
and
all
i
ask
is
that
you
go
on
as
you
are
and
see
more
of
her
and
how
do
you
know
but
you
may
fall
in
love
with
her
as
you
call
it
madam
since
you
press
me
so
far
my
affections
are
engaged
to
another
person
do
not
look
so
dreadfully
shocked
my
dear
mother
i
have
told
you
truly
that
i
think
myself
too
young
much
too
young
yet
to
marry
in
the
circumstances
in
which
i
know
my
family
are
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
not
for
some
years
be
able
to
marry
as
i
wish
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
i
shall
not
take
any
step
i
shall
not
even
declare
my
attachment
to
the
object
of
my
affection
without
your
knowledge
and
far
from
being
inclined
to
follow
headlong
my
own
passions
strong
as
they
are
be
assured
that
the
honour
of
my
family
your
happiness
my
mother
my
father
are
my
first
objects
i
shall
never
think
of
my
own
till
these
are
secured
of
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
lady
clonbrony
heard
only
the
sound
of
the
words
from
the
moment
her
son
had
pronounced
that
his
affections
were
engaged
she
had
been
running
over
in
her
head
every
probable
and
improbable
person
she
could
think
of
at
last
suddenly
starting
up
she
opened
one
of
the
into
the
next
apartment
and
called
grace
nugent
put
down
your
pencil
grace
this
minute
and
come
here
miss
nugent
obeyed
with
her
usual
alacrity
and
the
moment
she
entered
the
room
lady
clonbrony
fixing
her
eyes
full
upon
her
said
your
cousin
colambre
tells
me
his
affections
are
engaged
to
miss
broadhurst
no
doubt
said
miss
nugent
smiling
with
a
simplicity
and
openness
of
countenance
which
assured
lady
clonbrony
that
all
was
safe
in
that
quarter
a
suspicion
which
had
darted
into
her
mind
was
dispelled
doubt
ay
do
you
hear
that
no
doubt
colambre
grace
you
see
has
no
doubt
nobody
has
any
doubt
but
yourself
colambre
are
your
affections
engaged
and
not
to
miss
broadhurst
said
miss
nugent
approaching
lord
colambre
now
you
see
how
you
surprise
and
disappoint
everybody
colambre
am
sorry
that
miss
nugent
should
be
disappointed
said
lord
colambre
because
i
am
disappointed
pray
do
not
call
me
miss
nugent
or
turn
away
from
me
as
if
you
were
displeased
must
then
be
some
cambridgeshire
lady
said
lady
clonbrony
am
sure
i
am
very
sorry
he
ever
went
to
cambridge
oxford
i
advised
one
of
the
miss
berryls
i
presume
who
have
nothing
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
those
berryls
there
was
the
reason
of
the
son
vast
intimacy
grace
you
may
give
up
all
thoughts
of
sir
arthur
have
no
thoughts
to
give
up
said
miss
nugent
smiling
broadhurst
continued
she
going
on
eagerly
with
what
she
was
saying
to
lord
colambre
broadhurst
is
my
friend
a
friend
i
love
and
admire
but
you
will
allow
that
i
strictly
kept
my
promise
never
to
praise
her
to
you
till
you
should
begin
to
praise
her
to
me
now
recollect
last
night
you
did
praise
her
to
me
so
justly
that
i
thought
you
liked
her
i
confess
so
that
it
is
natural
i
should
feel
a
little
disappointed
now
you
know
the
whole
of
my
mind
i
have
no
intention
to
encroach
on
your
confidence
therefore
there
is
no
occasion
to
look
so
embarrassed
i
give
you
my
word
i
will
never
speak
to
you
again
upon
the
subject
said
she
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
you
will
never
again
call
me
miss
nugent
am
i
not
your
own
cousin
grace
do
not
be
displeased
with
her
are
my
own
dear
cousin
grace
and
nothing
can
be
farther
from
my
mind
than
any
thought
of
being
displeased
with
her
especially
just
at
this
moment
when
i
am
going
away
probably
for
a
considerable
time
when
where
morning
for
ireland
of
all
places
cried
lady
clonbrony
upon
earth
puts
it
into
your
head
to
go
to
ireland
you
do
very
well
to
go
out
of
the
way
of
falling
in
love
ridiculously
since
that
is
the
reason
of
your
going
but
what
put
ireland
into
your
head
child
will
not
presume
to
ask
my
mother
what
put
ireland
out
of
her
head
said
lord
colambre
smiling
she
will
recollect
that
it
is
my
native
country
was
your
father
fault
not
mine
said
lady
clonbrony
i
wished
to
have
been
confined
in
england
but
he
would
have
it
to
say
that
his
son
and
heir
was
born
at
clonbrony
castle
and
there
was
a
great
argument
between
him
and
my
uncle
and
something
about
the
prince
of
wales
and
caernarvon
castle
was
thrown
in
and
that
turned
the
scale
much
against
my
will
for
it
was
my
wish
that
my
son
should
be
an
englishman
born
like
myself
but
after
all
i
do
see
that
having
the
misfortune
to
be
born
in
a
country
should
tie
one
to
it
in
any
sort
of
way
and
i
should
have
hoped
your
english
edication
colambre
would
have
given
you
too
liberal
idears
for
that
so
i
reelly
do
see
why
you
should
go
to
ireland
merely
because
it
your
native
country
merely
because
it
is
my
native
country
but
i
wish
to
go
thither
i
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
it
because
it
is
the
country
in
which
my
father
property
lies
and
from
which
we
draw
our
subsistence
lord
bless
me
what
a
word
fitter
for
a
pauper
than
a
nobleman
subsistence
then
if
you
are
going
to
look
after
your
father
property
i
hope
you
will
make
the
agents
do
their
duty
and
send
us
remittances
and
pray
how
long
do
you
mean
to
stay
i
am
of
age
madam
if
you
have
no
objection
i
will
spend
the
ensuing
months
in
travelling
in
ireland
and
i
will
return
here
by
the
time
i
am
of
age
unless
you
and
my
father
should
before
that
time
be
in
ireland
the
least
chance
of
that
if
i
can
prevent
it
i
promise
you
said
lady
clonbrony
lord
colambre
and
miss
nugent
sighed
i
am
sure
i
shall
take
it
very
unkindly
of
you
colambre
if
you
go
and
turn
out
a
partisan
for
ireland
after
all
like
grace
nugent
partisan
no
i
hope
not
a
partisan
but
a
friend
said
miss
nugent
child
i
hate
to
hear
people
women
especially
and
young
ladies
particularly
talk
of
being
friends
to
this
country
or
that
country
what
can
they
know
about
countries
better
think
of
being
friends
to
themselves
and
friends
to
their
friends
was
wrong
said
miss
nugent
call
myself
a
friend
to
ireland
i
meant
to
say
that
ireland
had
been
a
friend
to
me
that
i
found
irish
friends
when
i
had
no
other
an
irish
home
when
i
had
no
other
that
my
earliest
and
happiest
years
under
your
kind
care
had
been
spent
there
and
that
i
can
never
forget
that
my
dear
aunt
i
hope
you
do
not
wish
that
i
should
forbid
my
sweet
grace
said
lady
clonbrony
touched
by
her
voice
and
manner
forbid
i
do
wish
you
to
do
or
be
anything
but
what
you
are
for
i
am
convinced
there
nothing
i
could
ask
you
would
not
do
for
me
and
i
can
tell
you
there
few
things
you
could
ask
love
i
would
not
do
for
you
a
wish
was
instantly
expressed
in
the
eyes
of
her
niece
lady
clonbrony
though
not
usually
quick
at
interpreting
the
wishes
of
others
understood
and
answered
before
she
ventured
to
make
her
request
in
words
anything
but
that
grace
return
to
clonbrony
while
i
am
able
to
live
in
london
that
i
never
can
or
will
do
for
you
or
anybody
looking
at
her
son
in
all
the
pride
of
obstinacy
there
is
an
end
of
the
matter
go
you
where
you
please
colambre
and
i
shall
stay
where
i
please
i
suppose
as
your
mother
i
have
a
right
to
say
this
much
her
son
with
the
utmost
respect
assured
her
that
he
had
no
design
to
infringe
upon
her
undoubted
liberty
of
judging
for
herself
that
he
had
never
interfered
except
so
far
as
to
tell
her
circumstances
of
her
affairs
with
which
she
seemed
to
be
totally
unacquainted
and
of
which
it
might
be
dangerous
to
her
to
continue
in
ignorance
talk
to
me
about
affairs
cried
she
drawing
her
hand
away
from
her
son
to
my
lord
or
my
lord
agents
since
you
are
going
to
ireland
about
business
i
know
nothing
about
business
but
this
i
know
i
shall
stay
in
england
and
be
in
london
every
season
as
long
as
i
can
afford
it
and
when
i
can
not
afford
to
live
here
i
hope
i
shall
not
live
anywhere
that
my
notion
of
life
and
that
my
determination
once
for
all
for
if
none
of
the
rest
of
the
clonbrony
family
have
any
i
thank
heaven
i
have
some
spirit
saying
this
with
her
most
stately
manner
she
walked
out
of
the
room
lord
colambre
instantly
followed
her
for
after
the
resolution
and
the
promise
he
had
made
he
did
not
dare
to
trust
himself
at
this
moment
with
miss
nugent
there
was
to
be
a
concert
this
night
at
lady
clonbrony
at
which
and
miss
broadhurst
were
of
course
expected
that
they
might
not
be
quite
unprepared
for
the
event
of
her
son
going
to
ireland
lady
clonbrony
wrote
a
note
to
broadhurst
begging
her
to
come
half
an
hour
earlier
than
the
time
mentioned
in
the
cards
she
might
talk
over
something
particular
that
had
just
occurred
what
passed
at
this
cabinet
council
as
it
seems
to
have
had
no
immediate
influence
on
affairs
we
need
not
record
suffice
it
to
observe
that
a
great
deal
was
said
and
nothing
done
miss
broadhurst
however
was
not
a
young
lady
who
could
be
easily
deceived
even
where
her
passions
were
concerned
the
moment
her
mother
told
her
of
lord
colambre
intended
departure
she
saw
the
whole
truth
she
had
a
strong
mind
was
capable
of
drawing
aside
at
once
the
curtain
of
and
looking
steadily
at
the
skeleton
of
truth
she
had
a
generous
perhaps
because
a
strong
mind
for
surrounded
as
she
had
been
from
her
childhood
by
every
means
of
which
wealth
and
flattery
could
bestow
she
had
discovered
early
what
few
persons
in
her
situation
discover
till
late
in
life
that
selfish
gratifications
may
render
us
incapable
of
other
happiness
but
can
never
of
themselves
make
us
happy
despising
flatterers
she
had
determined
to
make
herself
friends
to
make
them
in
the
only
possible
way
by
deserving
them
her
father
made
his
immense
fortune
by
the
power
and
habit
of
constant
bold
and
just
calculation
the
power
and
habit
which
she
had
learned
from
him
she
applied
on
a
far
larger
scale
with
him
it
was
confined
to
speculations
for
the
acquisition
of
money
with
her
it
extended
to
the
attainment
of
happiness
he
was
calculating
and
mercenary
she
was
estimative
and
generous
miss
nugent
was
dressing
for
the
concert
or
rather
was
sitting
before
her
glass
reflecting
when
miss
broadhurst
came
into
her
room
miss
nugent
immediately
sent
her
maid
out
of
the
room
said
miss
broadhurst
looking
at
grace
with
an
air
of
open
deliberate
composure
and
i
are
thinking
of
the
same
thing
of
the
same
person
of
lord
colambre
said
miss
nugent
ingenuously
and
sorrowfully
i
can
put
your
mind
at
ease
at
once
my
dear
friend
by
assuring
you
that
i
shall
think
of
him
no
more
that
i
have
thought
of
him
i
do
not
deny
i
have
thought
that
if
notwithstanding
the
difference
in
our
ages
and
other
differences
he
had
preferred
me
i
should
have
preferred
him
to
any
person
who
has
ever
yet
addressed
me
on
our
first
acquaintance
i
clearly
saw
that
he
was
not
disposed
to
pay
court
to
my
fortune
and
i
had
also
then
coolness
of
judgment
sufficient
to
perceive
that
it
was
not
probable
he
should
fall
in
love
with
my
person
but
i
was
too
proud
in
my
humility
too
strong
in
my
honesty
too
brave
too
ignorant
in
short
i
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
we
are
all
of
us
more
or
less
subject
to
the
delusions
of
vanity
or
hope
or
love
i
even
i
who
thought
myself
so
did
not
know
how
with
one
flutter
of
his
wings
cupid
can
set
the
whole
atmosphere
in
motion
change
the
proportions
size
colour
value
of
every
object
lead
us
into
a
mirage
and
leave
us
in
a
dismal
desert
dearest
friend
said
miss
nugent
in
a
tone
of
true
sympathy
none
but
a
coward
or
a
fool
would
sit
down
in
the
desert
and
weep
instead
of
trying
to
make
his
way
back
before
the
storm
rises
obliterates
the
track
and
overwhelms
everything
poetry
apart
my
dear
grace
you
may
be
assured
that
i
shall
think
no
more
of
lord
colambre
believe
you
are
right
but
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
it
must
be
so
spare
me
your
sorrow
sorrow
is
for
lord
colambre
said
miss
nugent
will
he
find
such
a
wife
not
in
miss
berryl
i
am
sure
pretty
as
she
is
a
mere
fine
lady
is
it
possible
that
lord
colambre
lord
colambre
should
prefer
such
a
girl
lord
colambre
miss
broadhurst
looked
at
her
friend
as
she
spoke
and
saw
truth
in
her
eyes
saw
that
she
had
no
suspicion
that
she
was
herself
the
person
beloved
me
grace
are
you
sorry
that
lord
colambre
is
going
away
i
am
glad
i
was
sorry
when
i
first
heard
it
but
now
i
am
glad
very
glad
it
may
save
him
from
a
marriage
unworthy
of
him
restore
him
to
himself
and
reserve
him
for
the
only
woman
i
ever
saw
who
is
suited
to
him
who
is
equal
to
him
who
would
value
and
love
him
as
he
deserves
to
be
valued
and
loved
my
dear
if
you
mean
me
i
am
not
and
i
never
can
be
that
woman
therefore
as
you
are
my
friend
and
wish
my
happiness
as
i
sincerely
believe
you
do
never
i
conjure
you
present
such
an
idea
before
my
mind
again
it
is
out
of
my
mind
i
hope
for
ever
it
is
important
to
me
that
you
should
know
and
believe
this
at
least
i
will
preserve
my
friends
now
let
this
subject
never
be
mentioned
or
alluded
to
again
between
us
my
dear
we
have
subjects
enough
of
conversation
we
need
not
have
recourse
to
pernicious
sentimental
gossipings
there
is
a
great
difference
between
wanting
a
confidante
and
treating
a
friend
with
confidence
my
confidence
you
possess
all
that
ought
all
that
is
to
be
known
of
my
mind
you
know
and
now
i
will
leave
you
in
peace
to
dress
for
the
concert
do
go
you
do
interrupt
me
i
shall
be
dressed
in
a
few
minutes
stay
with
me
and
you
may
be
assured
that
neither
now
nor
at
any
other
time
shall
i
ever
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
you
desire
me
to
avoid
i
entirely

with
you
about
confidantes
and
sentimental
gossipings
i
love
you
for
not
loving

a
thundering
knock
at
the
door
announced
the
arrival
of
company
no
more
of
love
but
as
much
as
you
please
of
friendship

yourself
as
fast
as
you
can
said
miss
broadhurst
dress
is
the
order
of
the
day
order
of
the
day
and
order
of
the
night
and
all
for
people
i
do
care
for
in
the
least
said
grace
life
passes
me
miss
nugent
cried
petito
lady
clonbrony
woman
coming
in
with
a
face
of
alarm
dressed
yet
my
lady
is
gone
down
and
broadhurst
and
my
lady
pococke
come
and
the
honourable
trembleham
and
signor
the
italian
singing
gentleman
has
been
walking
up
and
down
the
apartments
there
by
himself
disconsolate
this
and
i
wondering
all
the
time
nobody
rang
for
me
but
my
lady
dressed
lord
knows
how
without
anybody
oh
merciful
miss
nugent
if
you
could
stand
still
for
one
single
particle
of
a
second
so
then
i
thought
of
stepping
in
to
miss
nugent
for
the
young
ladies
are
talking
so
fast
says
i
to
myself
at
the
door
they
will
never
know
how
time
goes
unless
i
give
a
hint
but
now
my
lady
is
below
there
no
need
to
be
sure
to
be
nervous
so
we
may
take
the
thing
quietly
without
being
in
a
flustrum
dear
ladies
is
not
this
now
a
very
sudden
motion
of
our
young
lord
for
ireland
lud
a
mercy
miss
nugent
i
sure
your
motions
is
sudden
enough
and
your
dress
behind
is
all
i
sure
i
ca
tell
how
never
mind
said
the
young
lady
escaping
from
her
will
do
very
well
thank
you
petito
will
do
very
well
never
mind
repeated
petito
muttering
to
herself
as
she
looked
after
the
ladies
whilst
they
ran
downstairs
ca
abide
to
dress
any
young
lady
who
says
never
mind
and
it
will
do
very
well
that
and
her
never
talking
to
one
confidantially
or
trusting
one
with
the
least
bit
of
her
secrets
is
the
thing
i
ca
put
up
with
from
miss
nugent
and
miss
broadhurst
holding
the
pins
to
me
as
much
as
to
say
do
your
business
petito
and
do
now
that
so
impertinent
as
if
one
was
the
same
flesh
and
blood
and
had
not
as
good
a
right
to
talk
of
everything
and
hear
of
everything
as
themselves
and
broadhurst
too
with
my
lady
and
pursing
up
her
city
mouth
when
i
come
in
and
turning
off
the
discourse
to
snuff
forsooth
as
if
i
was
an
ignoramus
to
think
they
closeted
themselves
to
talk
of
snuff
now
i
think
a
lady
of
quality
woman
has
as
good
a
right
to
be
trusted
with
her
lady
secrets
as
with
her
jewels
and
if
my
lady
clonbrony
was
a
real
lady
of
quality
she
know
that
and
consider
the
one
as
much
my
paraphernalia
as
the
other
so
i
shall
tell
my
lady
as
i
always
do
when
she
vexes
me
that
i
never
lived
in
an
irish
family
before
and
do
know
the
ways
of
it
then
she
tell
me
she
was
born
in
hoxfordshire
then
i
shall
say
with
my
saucy
look
oh
was
you
my
lady
i
always
forget
that
you
was
an
englishwoman
then
maybe
she
say
forget
you
forget
yourself
strangely
petito
then
i
shall
say
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
if
your
ladyship
thinks
so
my
lady
i
better
go
and
i
desire
no
better
than
that
she
would
take
me
at
my
word
for
my
lady
dashfort
is
a
much
better
place
i
told
and
she
dying
to
have
me
i
know
and
having
formed
this
resolution
petito
concluded
her
apparently
interminable
soliloquy
and
went
with
my
lord
gentleman
into
the
antechamber
to
hear
the
concert
and
give
her
judgment
on
everything
as
she
peeped
in
through
the
vista
of
heads
into
the
apollo
saloon
for
the
alhambra
was
transformed
into
the
apollo
saloon
she
saw
that
whilst
the
company
rank
behind
rank
in
close
semicircles
had
crowded
round
the
performers
to
hear
a
favourite
singer
miss
broadhurst
and
lord
colambre
were
standing
in
the
outer
semicircle
talking
to
one
another
earnestly
now
would
petito
have
given
up
her
reversionary
chance
of
the
three
nearly
new
gowns
she
expected
from
lady
clonbrony
in
case
she
stayed
or
in
case
she
went
the
reversionary
chance
of
any
dress
of
lady
dashfort
except
her
scarlet
velvet
merely
to
hear
what
miss
broadhurst
and
lord
colambre
were
saying
alas
she
could
only
see
their
lips
move
and
of
what
they
were
talking
whether
of
music
or
love
and
whether
the
match
was
to
be
on
or
off
she
could
only
conjecture
but
the
diplomatic
style
having
now
descended
to
petito
talked
to
her
friends
in
the
antechamber
with
as
mysterious
and
consequential
an
air
and
tone
as
a
charge
or
as
the
lady
of
a
charge
could
have
assumed
she
spoke
of
her
private
belief
of
the
impression
left
upon
her
mind
and
her
confidantial
reasons
for
thinking
as
she
did
of
her
had
it
from
the
fountain
head
and
of
fear
of
any
committal
of
her
authorities
notwithstanding
all
these
authorities
lord
colambre
left
london
next
day
and
pursued
his
way
to
ireland
determined
that
he
would
see
and
judge
of
that
country
for
himself
and
decide
whether
his
mother
dislike
to
residing
there
was
founded
on
caprice
or
reasonable
causes
in
the
meantime
it
was
reported
in
london
that
his
lordship
was
gone
to
ireland
to
make
out
the
title
to
some
estate
which
would
be
necessary
for
his
marriage
settlement
with
the
great
heiress
miss
broadhurst
whether
petito
or
sir
terence
had
the
greater
share
in
raising
and
spreading
this
report
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
but
it
is
certain
however
or
by
whomsoever
raised
it
was
most
useful
to
lord
clonbrony
by
keeping
his
creditors
quiet
chapter
vi
the
tide
did
not
permit
the
packet
to
reach
the
and
the
impatient
lord
colambre
stepped
into
a
boat
and
was
rowed
across
the
bay
of
dublin
it
was
a
fine
summer
morning
the
sun
shone
bright
on
the
wicklow
mountains
he
admired
he
exulted
in
the
beauty
of
the
prospect
and
all
the
early
associations
of
his
childhood
and
the
patriotic
hopes
of
his
riper
years
swelled
his
heart
as
he
approached
the
shores
of
his
native
land
but
scarcely
had
he
touched
his
mother
earth
when
the
whole
course
of
his
ideas
was
changed
and
if
his
heart
swelled
it
swelled
no
more
with
pleasurable
sensations
for
instantly
he
found
himself
surrounded
and
attacked
by
a
swarm
of
beggars
and
harpies
with
strange
figures
and
stranger
tones
some
craving
his
charity
some
snatching
away
his
luggage
and
at
the
same
time
bidding
him
trouble
himself
and
fear
a
scramble
in
the
boat
and
on
shore
for
bags
and
parcels
began
and
an
amphibious
fight
betwixt
men
who
had
one
foot
on
sea
and
one
on
land
was
seen
and
long
and
loud
the
battle
of
trunks
and
portmanteaus
raged
the
vanquished
departed
clinching
their
empty
hands
at
their
opponents
and
swearing
inextinguishable
hatred
while
the
smiling
victors
stood
at
ease
each
grasping
his
booty
bag
basket
parcel
or
portmanteau
your
honour
where
will
these
go
where
will
we
carry
all
to
for
your
honour
was
now
the
question
without
waiting
for
an
answer
most
of
the
goods
were
carried
at
the
discretion
of
the
porters
to
the
where
to
his
lordship
astonishment
after
this
scene
of
confusion
he
found
that
he
had
lost
nothing
but
his
patience
all
his
goods
were
safe
and
a
few
tinpennies
made
his
officious
porters
happy
men
and
boys
blessings
were
showered
upon
his
honour
and
he
was
left
in
peace
at
an
excellent
hotel
in
street
dublin
he
rested
refreshed
himself
recovered
his
and
walked
into
the
where
he
found
several
officers
english
irish
and
scotch
one
english
officer
a
very
man
of
middle
age
was
sitting
reading
a
little
pamphlet
when
lord
colambre
entered
he
looked
up
from
time
to
time
and
in
a
few
minutes
rose
and
joined
the
conversation
it
turned
upon
the
beauties
and
defects
of
the
city
of
dublin
sir
james
brooke
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
gentleman
showed
one
of
his
brother
officers
the
book
which
he
had
been
reading
observing
that
in
his
opinion
it
contained
one
of
the
best
views
of
dublin
which
he
had
ever
seen
evidently
drawn
by
the
hand
of
a
master
though
in
a
slight
playful
and
ironical
style
it
was
intercepted
letter
from
china
the
conversation
extended
from
dublin
to
various
parts
of
ireland
with
all
which
sir
james
brooke
showed
that
he
was
well
acquainted
observing
that
this
conversation
was
particularly
interesting
to
lord
colambre
and
quickly
perceiving
that
he
was
speaking
to
one
not
ignorant
of
books
sir
james
spoke
of
different
representations
and
misrepresentations
of
ireland
in
answer
to
lord
colambre
inquiries
he
named
the
works
which
had
afforded
him
most
satisfaction
and
with
discriminative
not
superficial
celerity
touched
on
all
ancient
and
modern
authors
from
spenser
and
davies
to
young
and
beaufort
lord
colambre
became
anxious
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
a
gentleman
who
appeared
so
able
and
willing
to
afford
him
information
sir
james
brooke
on
his
part
was
flattered
by
this
eagerness
of
attention
and
pleased
by
our
hero
manners
and
conversation
so
that
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
they
spent
much
of
their
time
together
whilst
they
were
at
this
hotel
and
meeting
frequently
in
society
in
dublin
their
acquaintance
every
day
increased
and
grew
into
intimacy
an
intimacy
which
was
highly
advantageous
to
lord
colambre
views
of
obtaining
a
just
idea
of
the
state
of
manners
in
ireland
sir
james
brooke
had
at
different
periods
been
quartered
in
various
parts
of
the
country
had
resided
long
enough
in
each
to
become
familiar
with
the
people
and
had
varied
his
residence
sufficiently
to
form
comparisons
between
different
counties
their
habits
and
characteristics
hence
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
direct
the
attention
of
our
young
observer
at
once
to
the
points
most
worthy
of
his
examination
and
to
save
him
from
the
common
error
of
travellers
the
deducing
general
conclusions
from
a
few
particular
cases
or
arguing
from
exceptions
as
if
they
were
rules
lord
colambre
from
his
family
connexions
had
of
course
immediate
introduction
into
the
best
society
in
dublin
or
rather
into
all
the
good
society
of
dublin
in
dublin
there
is
positively
good
company
and
positively
bad
but
not
as
in
london
many
degrees
of
comparison
not
innumerable
luminaries
of
the
polite
world
moving
in
different
orbits
of
fashion
but
all
the
bright
planets
of
note
and
name
move
and
revolve
in
the
same
narrow
limits
lord
colambre
did
not
find
that
either
his
father
or
his
mother
representations
of
society
in
dublin
resembled
the
reality
which
he
now
beheld
lady
clonbrony
had
in
terms
of
detestation
described
dublin
such
as
it
appeared
to
her
soon
after
the
union
lord
clonbrony
had
painted
it
with
convivial
enthusiasm
such
as
he
saw
it
long
and
long
before
the
union
when
first
he
drank
claret
at
the
fashionable
clubs
this
picture
unchanged
in
his
memory
and
unchangeable
by
his
imagination
had
remained
and
ever
would
remain
the
same
the
hospitality
of
which
the
father
boasted
the
son
found
in
all
its
warmth
but
meliorated
and
refined
less
convivial
more
social
the
fashion
of
hospitality
had
improved
to
make
the
stranger
eat
or
drink
to
excess
to
set
before
him
old
wine
and
old
plate
was
no
longer
the
sum
of
good
breeding
the
guest
now
escaped
the
pomp
of
grand
entertainments
was
allowed
to
enjoy
ease
and
conversation
and
to
taste
some
of
that
feast
of
reason
and
that
flow
of
soul
so
often
talked
of
and
so
seldom
enjoyed
lord
colambre
found
a
spirit
of
improvement
a
desire
for
knowledge
and
a
taste
for
science
and
literature
in
most
companies
particularly
among
gentlemen
belonging
to
the
irish
bar
nor
did
he
in
dublin
society
see
any
of
that
confusion
of
ranks
or
predominance
of
vulgarity
of
which
his
mother
had
complained
lady
clonbrony
had
assured
him
that
the
last
time
she
had
been
at
the
at
the
castle
a
lady
whom
she
afterwards
found
to
be
a
grocer
wife
had
turned
angrily
when
her
ladyship
had
accidentally
trodden
on
her
train
and
had
exclaimed
with
a
strong
brogue
thank
you
for
the
rest
of
my
tail
sir
james
brooke
to
whom
lord
colambre
without
giving
up
his
authority
mentioned
the
fact
declared
that
he
had
no
doubt
the
thing
had
happened
precisely
as
it
was
stated
but
that
this
was
one
of
the
extraordinary
cases
which
ought
not
to
pass
into
a
general
rule
that
it
was
a
slight
instance
of
that
influence
of
temporary
causes
from
which
no
conclusions
as
to
national
manners
should
be
drawn
happened
continued
sir
james
be
quartered
in
dublin
soon
after
the
union
took
place
and
i
remember
the
great
but
transient
change
that
appeared
from
the
removal
of
both
houses
of
parliament
most
of
the
nobility
and
many
of
the
principal
families
among
the
irish
commoners
either
hurried
in
high
hopes
to
london
or
retired
disgusted
and
in
despair
to
their
houses
in
the
country
immediately
in
dublin
commerce
rose
into
the
vacated
seats
of
rank
wealth
rose
into
the
place
of
birth
new
faces
and
new
equipages
appeared
people
who
had
never
been
heard
of
before
started
into
notice
pushed
themselves
forward
not
scrupling
to
elbow
their
way
even
at
the
castle
and
they
were
presented
to
my
and
to
my
for
their
excellencies
for
the
time
being
might
have
played
their
parts
to
empty
benches
had
they
not
admitted
such
persons
for
the
moment
to
fill
their
court
those
of
former
times
of
hereditary
pretensions
and
minds
and
manners
were
scandalised
at
all
this
and
they
complained
with
justice
that
the
whole
tone
of
society
was
altered
that
the
decorum
elegance
polish
and
charm
of
society
was
gone
and
i
among
the
rest
said
sir
james
felt
and
deplored
their
change
but
now
it
is
all
over
we
may
acknowledge
that
perhaps
even
those
things
which
we
felt
most
disagreeable
at
the
time
were
productive
of
eventual
benefit
a
few
families
had
set
the
fashion
from
time
immemorial
everything
had
in
dublin
been
submitted
to
their
hereditary
authority
and
conversation
though
it
had
been
rendered
polite
by
their
example
was
at
the
same
time
limited
within
narrow
bounds
young
people
educated
upon
a
more
enlarged
plan
in
time
grew
up
and
no
authority
or
fashion
forbidding
it
necessarily
rose
to
their
just
place
and
enjoyed
their
due
influence
in
society
the
want
of
manners
joined
to
the
want
of
knowledge
in
the
new
set
created
universal
disgust
they
were
compelled
some
by
ridicule
some
by
bankruptcies
to
fall
back
into
their
former
places
from
which
they
could
never
more
emerge
in
the
meantime
some
of
the
irish
nobility
and
gentry
who
had
been
living
at
an
unusual
expense
in
london
an
expense
beyond
their
incomes
were
glad
to
return
home
to
refit
and
they
brought
with
them
a
new
stock
of
ideas
and
some
taste
for
science
and
literature
which
within
these
latter
years
have
become
fashionable
indeed
indispensable
in
london
that
part
of
the
irish
aristocracy
who
immediately
upon
the
first
incursions
of
the
vulgarians
had
fled
in
despair
to
their
fastnesses
in
the
country
hearing
of
the
improvements
which
had
gradually
taken
place
in
society
and
assured
of
the
final
expulsion
of
the
barbarians
ventured
from
their
retreats
and
returned
to
their
posts
in
town
so
that
now
concluded
sir
james
find
a
society
in
dublin
composed
of
a
most
agreeable
and
salutary
mixture
of
birth
and
education
gentility
and
knowledge
manner
and
matter
and
you
see
pervading
the
whole
new
life
and
energy
new
talent
new
ambition
a
desire
and
a
determination
to
improve
and
be
improved
a
perception
that
higher
distinction
can
now
be
obtained
in
almost
all
company
by
genius
and
merit
than
by
airs
and
dress
so
much
for
the
higher
order
now
among
the
class
of
tradesmen
and
shopkeepers
you
may
amuse
yourself
my
lord
with
marking
the
difference
between
them
and
persons
of
the
same
rank
in
london
lord
colambre
had
several
commissions
to
execute
for
his
english
friends
and
he
made
it
his
amusement
in
every
shop
to
observe
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
people
he
remarked
that
there
are
in
dublin
two
classes
of
tradespeople
one
who
go
into
business
with
intent
to
make
it
their
occupation
for
life
and
as
a
slow
but
sure
means
of
providing
for
themselves
and
their
families
another
class
who
take
up
trade
merely
as
a
temporary
resource
to
which
they
condescend
for
a
few
years
trusting
that
they
shall
in
that
time
make
a
fortune
retire
and
commence
or
recommence
gentlemen
the
irish
regular
men
of
business
are
like
all
other
men
of
business
punctual
frugal
careful
and
so
forth
with
the
addition
of
more
intelligence
invention
and
enterprise
than
are
usually
found
in
englishmen
of
the
same
rank
but
the
dublin
tradesmen
pro
tempore
are
a
class
by
themselves
they
begin
without
capital
buy
stock
upon
credit
in
hopes
of
making
large
profits
and
in
the
same
hopes
sell
upon
credit
now
if
the
credit
they
can
obtain
is
longer
than
that
which
they
are
forced
to
give
they
go
on
and
prosper
if
not
they
break
turn
bankrupts
and
sometimes
as
bankrupts
thrive
by
such
men
of
course
every
short
cut
to
fortune
is
followed
whilst
every
habit
which
requires
time
to
prove
its
advantage
is
disregarded
nor
with
such
views
can
a
character
for
punctuality
have
its
just
value
in
the
head
of
a
man
who
intends
to
be
a
tradesman
and
a
gentleman
the
ideas
of
the
honesty
and
the
duties
of
a
tradesman
and
of
the
honour
and
the
accomplishments
of
a
gentleman
are
oddly
jumbled
together
and
the
characteristics
of
both
are
lost
in
the
compound
he
will
oblige
you
but
he
will
not
obey
you
he
will
do
you
a
favour
but
he
will
not
do
you
justice
he
will
do
anything
to
serve
you
but
the
particular
thing
you
order
he
neglects
he
asks
your
pardon
for
he
would
not
for
all
the
goods
in
his
warehouse
disoblige
you
not
for
the
sake
of
your
custom
but
he
has
a
particular
regard
for
your
family
economy
in
the
eyes
of
such
a
tradesman
is
if
not
a
mean
vice
at
least
a
shabby
virtue
which
he
is
too
polite
to
suspect
his
customers
of
and
particularly
proud
to
prove
himself
superior
to
many
london
tradesmen
after
making
their
thousands
and
their
tens
of
thousands
feel
pride
in
still
continuing
to
live
like
plain
men
of
business
but
from
the
moment
a
dublin
tradesman
of
this
style
has
made
a
few
hundreds
he
sets
up
his
gig
and
then
his
head
is
in
his
carriage
and
not
in
his
business
and
when
he
has
made
a
few
thousands
he
buys
or
builds
a
and
then
and
thenceforward
his
head
heart
and
soul
are
in
his
and
only
his
body
in
the
shop
with
his
customers
whilst
he
is
making
money
his
wife
or
rather
his
lady
is
spending
twice
as
much
out
of
town
as
he
makes
in
it
at
the
word
let
no
one
figure
to
himself
a
snug
little
box
like
that
in
which
a
warm
london
citizen
after
long
years
of
toil
indulges
himself
one
day
out
of
seven
in
repose
enjoying
from
his
gazabo
the
smell
of
the
dust
and
the
view
of
passing
coaches
on
the
london
road
no
these
hibernian
villas
are
on
a
much
more
magnificent
scale
some
of
them
formerly
belonged
to
irish
members
of
parliament
who
are
at
a
distance
from
their
after
the
union
these
were
bought
by
citizens
and
tradesmen
who
spoiled
by
the
mixture
of
their
own
fancies
what
had
originally
been
designed
by
men
of
good
taste
some
time
after
lord
colambre
arrival
in
dublin
he
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
one
of
these
villas
which
belonged
to
raffarty
a
grocer
lady
and
sister
to
one
of
lord
clonbrony
agents
nicholas
garraghty
lord
colambre
was
surprised
to
find
that
his
father
agent
resided
in
dublin
he
had
been
used
to
see
agents
or
stewards
as
they
are
called
in
england
live
in
the
country
and
usually
on
the
estate
of
which
they
have
the
management
nicholas
garraghty
however
had
a
handsome
house
in
a
fashionable
part
of
dublin
lord
colambre
called
several
times
to
see
him
but
he
was
out
of
town
receiving
rents
for
some
other
gentlemen
as
he
was
agent
for
more
than
one
property
though
our
hero
had
not
the
honour
of
seeing
garraghty
he
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
raffarty
one
day
at
her
brother
house
just
as
his
lordship
came
to
the
door
she
was
going
on
her
to
her
villa
called
tusculum
situate
near
bray
she
spoke
much
of
the
beauties
of
the
vicinity
of
dublin
found
his
lordship
was
going
with
sir
james
brooke
and
a
party
of
gentlemen
to
see
the
county
of
wicklow
and
his
lordship
and
party
were
entreated
to
do
her
the
honour
of
taking
in
his
way
a
little
collation
at
tusculum
our
hero
was
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
more
of
a
species
of
fine
lady
with
which
he
was
unacquainted
the
invitation
was
verbally
made
and
verbally
accepted
but
the
lady
afterwards
thought
it
necessary
to
send
a
written
invitation
in
due
form
and
the
note
she
sent
directed
to
the
most
right
honourable
the
lord
viscount
colambre
on
opening
it
he
perceived
that
it
could
not
have
been
intended
for
him
it
ran
as
follows
my
dear
juliana
i
have
got
a
promise
from
colambre
that
he
will
be
with
us
at
tusculum
on
friday
the
in
his
way
from
the
county
of
wicklow
for
the
collation

mentioned
and

a
large
party
of
officers

early
with
your
house
or
as
many
as

let
it
transpire
to
but

anything
and
tell
her

concerned

the
night
with
me
so

not
have
beds
excuse
haste
and
compliments
etc
tusculum
sunday
after
a
charming
tour
in
the
county
of
wicklow
where
the
beauty
of
the
natural
scenery
and
the
taste
with
which
those
natural
beauties
had
been
cultivated
far
surpassed
the
sanguine
expectations
lord
colambre
had
formed
his
lordship
and
his
companions
arrived
at
tusculum
where
he
found
raffarty
and
miss
juliana
very
elegant
with
a
large
party
of
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
bray
assembled
in
a
fine
with
bad
pictures
and
gaudy
gilding
the
windows
were
all
shut
and
the
company
were
playing
cards
with
all
their
might
this
was
the
fashion
of
the
neighbourhood
in
compliment
to
lord
colambre
and
the
officers
the
ladies
left
the
and
raffarty
observing
that
his
lordship
seemed
partial
to
walking
took
him
out
as
she
said
do
the
honours
of
nature
and
art
his
lordship
was
much
amused
by
the
mixture
which
was
now
exhibited
to
him
of
taste
and
incongruity
ingenuity
and
absurdity
genius
and
blunder
by
the
contrast
between
the
finery
and
vulgarity
the
affectation
and
ignorance
of
the
lady
of
the
villa
we
should
be
obliged
to
stop
too
long
at
tusculum
were
we
to
attempt
to
detail
all
the
odd
circumstances
of
this
visit
but
we
may
record
an
example
or
two
which
may
give
a
sufficient
idea
of
the
whole
in
the
first
place
before
they
left
the
miss
juliana
pointed
out
to
his
lordship
attention
a
picture
over
the
not
it
a
fine
piece
my
lord
said
she
naming
the
price
raffarty
had
lately
paid
for
it
at
an
has
a
right
to
be
a
fine
piece
indeed
for
it
cost
a
fine
price
nevertheless
this
fine
piece
was
a
vile
daub
and
our
hero
could
only
avoid
the
sin
of
flattery
or
the
danger
of
offending
the
lady
by
protesting
that
he
had
no
judgment
in
pictures
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
connoisseur
or
conoscenti
myself
but
i
told
the
style
is
undeniably
modern
and
was
not
i
lucky
juliana
not
to
let
that
medona
be
knocked
down
to
me
i
was
just
going
to
bid
when
i
heard
such
smart
bidding
but
fortunately
the
auctioneer
let
out
that
it
was
done
by
a
very
old
master
a
hundred
years
old
oh
your
most
obedient
thinks
i
if
that
the
case
it
not
for
my
money
so
i
bought
this
in
lieu
of
the
thing
and
had
it
a
bargain
in
architecture
rafferty
had
as
good
a
taste
and
as
much
skill
as
in
painting
there
had
been
a
handsome
portico
in
front
of
the
house
but
this
interfering
with
the
lady
desire
to
have
a
veranda
which
she
said
could
not
be
dispensed
with
she
had
raised
the
whole
portico
to
the
second
story
where
it
stood
or
seemed
to
stand
upon
a
tarpaulin
roof
but
raffarty
explained
that
the
pillars
though
they
looked
so
properly
substantial
were
really
hollow
and
as
light
as
feathers
and
were
supported
with
cramps
without
disobliging
the
front
wall
of
the
house
at
all
to
signify
she
showed
the
company
any
farther
she
said
must
premise
to
his
lordship
that
she
had
been
originally
stinted
in
room
for
her
improvements
so
that
she
could
not
follow
her
genius
liberally
she
had
been
reduced
to
have
some
things
on
a
confined
scale
and
occasionally
to
consult
her
but
she
prided
herself
upon
having
put
as
much
into
a
light
pattern
as
could
well
be
that
had
been
her
whole
ambition
study
and
problem
for
she
was
determined
to
have
at
least
the
honour
of
having
a
little
taste
of
everything
at
tusculum
so
she
led
the
way
to
a
little
conservatory
and
a
little
pinery
and
a
little
grapery
and
a
little
aviary
and
a
little
pheasantry
and
a
little
dairy
for
show
and
a
little
cottage
for
ditto
with
a
grotto
full
of
shells
and
a
little
hermitage
full
of
earwigs
and
a
little
ruin
full
of
enlarge
and
multiply
the
effect
of
the
gothic
you
could
only
put
your
head
in
because
it
was
just
fresh
painted
and
though
there
had
been
a
fire
ordered
in
the
ruin
all
night
it
had
only
smoked
in
all
raffarty
buildings
whether
ancient
or
modern
there
was
a
studied
crookedness
she
said
hated
everything
straight
it
was
so
formal
and
unpicturesque
uniformity
and
conformity
she
observed
had
their
day
but
now
thank
the
stars
of
the
present
day
irregularity
and
deformity
bear
the
bell
and
have
the
majority
as
they
proceeded
and
walked
through
the
grounds
from
which
raffarty
though
she
had
done
her
best
could
not
take
that
which
nature
had
given
she
pointed
out
to
my
lord
happy
moving
termination
consisting
of
a
chinese
bridge
with
a
fisherman
leaning
over
the
rails
on
a
sudden
the
fisherman
was
seen
to
tumble
over
the
bridge
into
the
water
the
gentlemen
ran
to
extricate
the
poor
fellow
while
they
heard
raffarty
bawling
to
his
lordship
to
beg
he
would
never
mind
and
not
trouble
himself
when
they
arrived
at
the
bridge
they
saw
the
man
hanging
from
part
of
the
bridge
and
apparently
struggling
in
the
water
but
when
they
attempted
to
pull
him
up
they
found
it
was
only
a
stuffed
figure
which
had
been
pulled
into
the
stream
by
a
real
fish
which
had
seized
hold
of
the
bait
raffarty
vexed
by
the
fisherman
fall
and
by
the
laughter
it
occasioned
did
not
recover
herself
sufficiently
to
be
happily
ridiculous
during
the
remainder
of
the
walk
nor
till
dinner
was
announced
when
she
apologised
for
changed
the
collation
at
first
intended
into
a
dinner
which
she
hoped
would
be
found
no
bad
substitute
and
which
she
flattered
herself
might
prevail
on
my
lord
and
the
gentlemen
to
sleep
as
there
was
no
moon
the
dinner
had
two
great
faults
profusion
and
pretension
there
was
in
fact
ten
times
more
on
the
table
than
was
necessary
and
the
entertainment
was
far
above
the
circumstances
of
the
person
by
whom
it
was
given
for
instance
the
dish
of
fish
at
the
head
of
the
table
had
been
brought
across
the
island
from
sligo
and
had
cost
five
guineas
as
the
lady
of
the
house
failed
not
to
make
known
but
after
all
things
were
not
of
a
piece
there
was
a
disparity
between
the
entertainment
and
the
attendants
there
was
no
proportion
or
fitness
of
things
a
painful
endeavour
at
what
could
not
be
attained
and
a
toiling
in
vain
to
conceal
and
repair
deficiencies
and
blunders
had
the
mistress
of
the
house
been
quiet
had
she
as
broadhurst
would
say
but
let
things
alone
let
things
take
their
course
all
would
have
passed
off
with
people
but
she
was
incessantly
apologising
and
fussing
and
fretting
inwardly
and
outwardly
and
directing
and
calling
to
her
servants
striving
to
make
a
butler
who
was
deaf
a
boy
who
was
do
the
business
of
five
accomplished
footmen
of
parts
and
figure
the
mistress
of
the
house
called
for
clean
plates
plates
none
did
come
when
she
did
call
for
them
raffarty
called
larry
my
lord

there
james
bread
to
captain
bowles
james
port
wine
to
the
major
james
james
kenny
james
panting
james
toiled
after
her
in
vain
at
length
one
course
was
fairly
got
through
and
after
a
torturing
the
second
course
appeared
and
james
kenny
was
intent
upon
one
thing
and
larry
upon
another
so
that
the
for
the
hare
was
spilt
by
their
collision
but
what
was
worse
there
seemed
little
chance
that
the
whole
of
this
second
course
should
ever
be
placed
altogether
rightly
upon
the
table
raffarty
cleared
her
throat
and
nodded
and
pointed
and
sighed
and
set
larry
after
kenny
and
kenny
after
larry
for
what
one
did
the
other
undid
and
at
last
the
lady
anger
kindled
and
she
spoke
james
kenny
set

at
this
corner
and
put
down
the
grass
and

james
the
pyramid
in
the
middle
ca
ye
the
pyramid
in
changing
places
was
overturned
then
it
was
that
the
mistress
of
the
feast
falling
back
in
her
seat
and
lifting
up
her
hands
and
eyes
in
despair
ejaculated
james
james
the
pyramid
was
raised
by
the
assistance
of
the
military
engineers
and
stood
trembling
again
on
its
base
but
the
lady
temper
could
not
be
so
easily
restored
to
its
equilibrium
the
comedy
of
errors
which
this
day
visit
exhibited
amused
all
the
spectators
but
lord
colambre
after
he
had
smiled
sometimes
similar
foibles
and
follies
in
persons
of
different
rank
fortune
and
manner
appear
to
common
observers
so
unlike
that
they
laugh
without
scruples
of
conscience
in
one
case
at
what
in
another
ought
to
touch
themselves
most
nearly
it
was
the
same
desire
to
appear
what
they
were
not
the
same
vain
ambition
to
vie
with
superior
rank
and
fortune
or
fashion
which
actuated
lady
clonbrony
and
raffarty
and
whilst
this
ridiculous
grocer
wife
made
herself
the
sport
of
some
of
her
guests
lord
colambre
sighed
from
the
reflection
that
what
she
was
to
them
his
mother
was
to
persons
in
a
higher
rank
of
he
sighed
still
more
deeply
when
he
considered
that
in
whatever
station
or
with
whatever
fortune
extravagance
that
is
the
living
beyond
our
income
must
lead
to
distress
and
meanness
and
end
in
shame
and
ruin
in
the
morning
as
they
were
riding
away
from
tusculum
and
talking
over
their
visit
the
officers
laughed
heartily
and
rallying
lord
colambre
upon
his
seriousness
accused
him
of
having
fallen
in
love
with
raffarty
or
with
the
elegant
miss
juliana
our
hero
who
wished
never
to
be
nice
overmuch
or
serious
out
of
season
laughed
with
those
that
laughed
and
endeavoured
to
catch
the
spirit
of
the
jest
but
sir
james
brooke
who
now
was
well
acquainted
with
his
countenance
and
who
knew
something
of
the
history
of
his
family
understood
his
real
feelings
and
sympathising
in
them
endeavoured
to
give
the
conversation
a
new
turn
there
bowles
said
he
as
they
were
just
riding
into
the
town
of
bray
at
the
barouche
standing
at
that
green
door
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
town
is
not
that
lady
dashfort
barouche
looks
like
what
she
sported
in
dublin
last
year
said
bowles
you
do
think
she
give
us
the
same
two
seasons
besides
she
is
not
in
ireland
is
she
i
did
not
hear
of
her
intending
to
come
over
again
beg
your
pardon
said
another
officer
will
come
again
to
so
good
a
market
to
marry
her
other
daughter
i
hear
she
said
or
swore
that
she
will
marry
the
young
widow
lady
isabel
to
an
irish
nobleman
she
says
she
swears
and
whatever
she
swears
she
do
replied
bowles
a
care
my
lord
colambre
if
she
sets
her
heart
upon
you
for
lady
isabel
she
has
you
nothing
can
save
you
heart
she
has
none
so
there
you
safe
my
lord
said
the
other
officer
if
lady
isabel
sets
her
eye
upon
you
no
basilisk
is
surer
if
lady
dashfort
had
landed
i
am
sure
we
should
have
heard
of
it
for
she
makes
noise
enough
wherever
she
goes
especially
in
dublin
where
all
she
said
and
did
was
echoed
and
magnified
till
one
could
hear
of
nothing
else
i
do
think
she
has
landed
hope
to
heaven
they
may
never
land
again
in
ireland
cried
sir
james
brooke
worthless
woman
especially
one
worthless
englishwoman
of
rank
does
incalculable
mischief
in
a
country
like
this
which
looks
up
to
the
sister
country
for
fashion
for
my
own
part
as
a
warm
friend
to
ireland
i
would
rather
see
all
the
toads
and
serpents
and
venomous
reptiles
that
patrick
carried
off
in
his
bag
come
back
to
this
island
than
these
two
dashers
why
they
would
bite
half
the
women
and
girls
in
the
kingdom
with
the
rage
for
mischief
before
half
the
husbands
and
fathers
could
turn
their
heads
about
and
once
bit
there
no
cure
in
nature
or
art
horses
to
this
barouche
cried
captain
sir
whose
carriage
is
this
said
the
captain
to
a
servant
who
was
standing
beside
it
lady
dashfort
sir
it
belongs
to
answered
the
servant
in
rather
a
surly
english
tone
and
turning
to
a
boy
who
was
lounging
at
the
door
bid
them
bring
out
the
horses
for
my
ladies
is
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
captain
bowles
stopped
to
make
his
servant
alter
the
girths
of
his
horse
and
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
the
whole
party
halted
captain
bowles
beckoned
to
the
landlord
of
the
inn
who
was
standing
at
his
door
lady
dashfort
is
here
again
this
is
her
barouche
is
not
it
sir
she
is
it
is
has
she
sold
her
fine
horses
no
sir
this
is
not
her
carriage
at
all
she
is
not
here
that
is
she
is
here
in
ireland
but
down
in
the
county
of
wicklow
on
a
visit
and
this
is
not
her
own
carriage
at
all
that
is
to
say
not
that
which
she
has
with
herself
driving
but
only
just
the
cast
barouche
like
as
she
keeps
for
the
lady
maids
the
lady
maids
that
is
good
that
is
new
faith
sir
james
do
you
hear
that
then
and
it
true
and
not
a
word
of
a
lie
said
the
honest
landlord
this
minute
we
got
a
directory
of
five
of
them
abigails
sitting
within
in
our
house
as
fine
ladies
as
great
dashers
too
every
bit
as
their
principals
and
kicking
up
as
much
dust
on
the
road
every
grain
think
of
them
now
the
likes
of
them
that
must
have
four
horses
and
would
not
stir
a
foot
with
one
less
as
the
gentleman
gentleman
there
was
telling
and
boasting
to
me
about
now
when
the
barouche
was
ordered
for
them
there
at
the
lady
house
where
lady
dashfort
is
on
a
visit
they
said
they
would
not
get
in
till
they
get
four
horses
and
their
ladies
backed
them
and
so
the
four
horses
was
got
and
they
just
drove
out
here
to
see
the
points
of
view
for
fashion
sake
like
their
betters
and
up
with
their
glasses
like
their
ladies
and
then
out
with
their
watches
and
is
it
time
to
lunch
so
there
they
have
been
lunching
within
on
what
they
brought
with
them
for
nothing
in
our
house
could
they
touch
of
course
they
brought
themselves
a
picknick
lunch
with
madeira
and
champagne
to
wash
it
down
why
gentlemen
what
do
you
think
but
a
set
of
them
as
they
were
bragging
to
me
turned
out
of
a
at
cheltenham
last
year
because
they
had
not
to
their
lunch
but
here
they
come
shawls
and
veils
and
all
streamers
flying
but
mum
is
my
cue
captain
are
these
girths
to
your
fancy
now
said
the
landlord
aloud
then
as
he
stooped
to
alter
a
buckle
he
said
in
a
voice
meant
to
be
heard
only
by
captain
bowles
there
a
tongue
male
or
female
in
the
three
kingdoms
it
in
that
foremost
woman
mrs
petito
petito
repeated
lord
colambre
as
the
name
caught
his
ear
and
approaching
the
barouche
in
which
the
five
abigails
were
now
seated
he
saw
the
identical
petito
who
when
he
left
london
had
been
in
his
mother
service
she
recognised
his
lordship
with
very
gracious
intimacy
and
before
he
had
time
to
ask
any
questions
she
answered
all
she
conceived
he
was
going
to
ask
and
with
a
volubility
which
justified
the
landlord
eulogium
of
her
tongue
my
lord
i
left
my
lady
clonbrony
some
time
back
the
day
after
you
left
town
and
both
her
ladyship
and
miss
nugent
was
charmingly
and
would
have
sent
their
loves
to
your
lordship
i
sure
if
they
any
notion
i
should
have
met
you
my
lord
so
soon
and
i
was
very
sorry
to
part
with
them
but
the
fact
was
my
lord
said
petito
laying
a
detaining
hand
upon
lord
colambre
whip
one
end
of
which
he
unwittingly
trusted
within
her
reach
and
my
lady
had
a
little
difference
which
the
best
friends
you
know
sometimes
have
so
my
lady
clonbrony
was
so
condescending
to
give
me
up
to
my
lady
dashfort
and
i
knew
no
more
than
the
child
unborn
that
her
ladyship
had
it
in
contemplation
to
cross
the
seas
but
to
oblige
my
lady
and
as
colonel
heathcock
with
his
regiment
of
militia
was
coming
for
purtection
in
the
packet
at
the
same
time
and
we
to
have
the
i
waived
my
objections
to
ireland
and
indeed
though
i
was
greatly
frighted
at
first
having
heard
all
we
heard
you
know
my
lord
from
lady
clonbrony
of
there
being
no
living
in
ireland
and
expecting
to
see
no
trees
nor
accommodation
nor
anything
but
bogs
all
along
yet
i
declare
i
was
very
agreeably
surprised
for
as
far
as
i
seen
at
dublin
and
in
the
vicinity
the
accommodations
and
everything
of
that
nature
now
is
vastly
with
lord
said
sir
james
brooke
shall
be
late
lord
colambre
shortly
withdrawing
his
whip
from
petito
turned
his
horse
away
she
stretching
over
the
back
of
the
barouche
as
he
rode
off
bawled
to
him
lord
we
at
stephen
green
when
we
at
dublin
but
as
he
did
not
choose
to
hear
she
raised
her
voice
to
its
highest
pitch
adding
where
are
you
my
lord
to
be
found
as
i
have
a
parcel
of
miss
nugent
for
you
lord
colambre
instantly
turned
back
and
gave
his
direction
done
faith
said
the
major
did
not
hear
her
say
when
lady
dashfort
is
to
be
in
town
said
captain
bowles
bowles
have
you
a
mind
to
lose
more
of
your
guineas
to
lady
dashfort
and
to
be
jockied
out
of
another
horse
by
lady
isabel
confound
it
no
i
keep
out
of
the
way
of
that
i
have
had
enough
said
captain
bowles
is
my
lord
colambre
turn
now
you
hear
that
lady
dashfort
would
be
very
proud
to
see
him
his
lordship
is
in
for
it
and
with
such
an
auxiliary
as
petito
lady
dashfort
has
him
for
lady
isabel
as
sure
as
he
has
a
heart
or
hand
compliments
to
the
ladies
but
my
heart
is
engaged
said
lord
colambre
my
hand
shall
go
with
my
heart
or
not
at
all
engaged
to
a
very
amiable
charming
woman
no
doubt
said
sir
james
brooke
have
an
excellent
opinion
of
your
taste
and
if
you
can
return
the
compliment
to
my
judgment
take
my
advice
do
trust
to
your
heart
being
engaged
much
less
plead
that
engagement
for
it
would
be
lady
dashfort
sport
and
lady
isabel
joy
to
make
you
break
your
engagement
and
break
your
mistress
heart
the
fairer
the
more
amiable
the
more
beloved
the
greater
the
triumph
the
greater
the
delight
in
giving
pain
all
the
time
love
would
be
out
of
the
question
neither
mother
nor
daughter
would
care
if
you
were
hanged
or
as
lady
dashfort
would
herself
have
expressed
it
if
you
were
such
women
i
should
think
a
man
heart
could
be
in
no
great
danger
said
lord
colambre
you
might
be
mistaken
my
lord
there
a
way
to
every
man
heart
which
no
man
in
his
own
case
is
aware
of
but
which
every
woman
knows
right
well
and
none
better
than
these
ladies
by
his
vanity
said
captain
bowles
am
not
so
vain
as
to
think
myself
without
vanity
said
lord
colambre
love
i
should
imagine
is
a
stronger
passion
than
vanity
should
imagine
stay
till
you
are
tried
my
lord
excuse
me
said
captain
bowles
laughing
lord
colambre
felt
the
good
sense
of
this
and
determined
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
these
dangerous
ladies
indeed
though
he
had
talked
he
had
scarcely
yet
thought
of
them
for
his
imagination
was
intent
upon
that
packet
from
miss
nugent
which
petito
said
she
had
for
him
he
heard
nothing
of
it
or
of
her
for
some
days
he
sent
his
servant
every
day
to
stephen
green
to
inquire
if
lady
dashfort
had
returned
to
town
her
ladyship
at
last
returned
but
petito
could
not
deliver
the
parcel
to
any
hand
but
lord
colambre
own
and
she
would
not
stir
out
because
her
lady
was
indisposed
no
longer
able
to
restrain
his
impatience
lord
colambre
went
himself
knocked
at
lady
dashfort
door
inquired
for
petito
was
shown
into
her
parlour
the
parcel
was
delivered
to
him
but
to
his
utter
disappointment
it
was
a
parcel
for
not
from
miss
nugent
it
contained
merely
an
odd
volume
of
some
book
of
miss
nugent
which
petito
said
she
had
put
up
along
with
her
things
in
a
mistake
and
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
return
it
by
the
next
opportunity
of
a
safe
conveyance
whilst
lord
colambre
to
comfort
himself
for
his
disappointment
was
fixing
his
eyes
upon
miss
nugent
name
written
by
her
own
hand
in
the
first
leaf
of
the
book
the
door
opened
and
the
figure
of
an
woman
in
deep
mourning
appeared
appeared
for
one
moment
and
retired
my
lord
colambre
about
a
parcel
i
was
bringing
for
him
from
england
my
lady
my
lady
isabel
my
lord
said
petito
whilst
petito
was
saying
this
the
entrance
and
retreat
had
been
made
and
made
with
such
dignity
grace
and
modesty
with
such
innocence
eyes
had
been
raised
upon
him
fixed
and
withdrawn
with
such
a
gracious
bend
the
lady
isabel
had
bowed
to
him
as
she
retired
with
such
a
smile
and
with
so
soft
a
voice
had
repeated
colambre
that
his
lordship
though
well
aware
that
all
this
was
mere
acting
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
as
he
left
the
house
is
a
pity
it
is
only
acting
there
is
certainly
something
very
engaging
in
this
woman
it
is
a
pity
she
is
an
actress
and
so
young
a
much
younger
woman
than
i
expected
a
widow
before
most
women
are
wives
so
young
surely
she
can
not
be
such
a
fiend
as
they
described
her
to
be
a
few
nights
afterwards
lord
colambre
was
with
some
of
his
acquaintance
at
the
theatre
when
lady
isabel
and
her
mother
came
into
the
box
where
seats
had
been
reserved
for
them
and
where
their
appearance
instantly
made
that
sensation
which
is
usually
created
by
the
entrance
of
persons
of
the
first
notoriety
in
the
fashionable
world
lord
colambre
was
not
a
man
to
be
dazzled
by
fashion
or
to
mistake
notoriety
for
deference
paid
to
merit
and
for
the
admiration
commanded
by
beauty
or
talents
lady
dashfort
coarse
person
loud
voice
daring
manners
and
indelicate
wit
disgusted
him
almost
past
endurance
he
saw
sir
james
brooke
in
the
box
opposite
to
him
and
twice
determined
to
go
round
to
him
his
lordship
had
crossed
the
benches
and
once
his
hand
was
upon
the
lock
of
the
door
but
attracted
as
much
by
the
daughter
as
repelled
by
the
mother
he
could
move
no
farther
the
mother
masculine
boldness
heightened
by
contrast
the
charms
of
the
daughter
soft
sentimentality
the
lady
isabel
seemed
to
shrink
from
the
indelicacy
of
her
mother
manners
and
seemed
peculiarly
distressed
by
the
strange
efforts
lady
dashfort
made
from
time
to
time
to
drag
her
forward
and
to
fix
upon
her
the
attention
of
gentlemen
colonel
heathcock
who
as
petito
had
informed
lord
colambre
had
come
over
with
his
regiment
to
ireland
was
beckoned
into
their
box
by
lady
dashfort
by
her
squeezed
into
a
seat
next
to
lady
isabel
but
lady
isabel
seemed
to
feel
sovereign
contempt
properly
repressed
by
politeness
for
what
in
a
low
whisper
to
a
female
friend
on
the
other
side
of
her
she
called
inanity
of
this
sad
coxcomb
other
coxcombs
of
a
more
vivacious
style
who
stationed
themselves
round
her
mother
or
to
whom
her
mother
stretched
from
box
to
box
to
talk
seemed
to
engage
no
more
of
lady
isabel
attention
than
just
what
she
was
compelled
to
give
by
lady
dashfort
repeated
calls
of
isabel
colonel
g
isabel
lord
d
bowing
to
you
belie
belie
sir
harry
b
isabel
child
with
your
eyes
on
the
stage
did
you
never
see
a
play
before
novice
major
p
waiting
to
catch
your
eye
this
quarter
of
an
hour
and
now
her
eyes
gone
down
to
her
sir
harry
do
take
it
from
her
eyes
so
radiant
only
made
to
read
lady
isabel
appeared
to
suffer
so
exquisitely
and
so
naturally
from
this
persecution
that
lord
colambre
said
to
himself
this
be
acting
it
is
the
best
acting
i
ever
saw
if
this
be
art
it
deserves
to
be
nature
and
with
this
sentiment
he
did
himself
the
honour
of
handing
lady
isabel
to
her
carriage
this
night
and
with
this
sentiment
he
awoke
next
morning
and
by
the
time
he
had
dressed
and
breakfasted
he
determined
that
it
was
impossible
all
that
he
had
seen
could
be
acting
woman
no
young
woman
could
have
such
art
sir
james
brooke
had
been
unwarrantably
severe
he
would
go
and
tell
him
so
but
sir
james
brooke
this
day
received
orders
for
his
regiment
to
march
to
quarters
in
a
distant
part
of
ireland
his
head
was
full
of
arms
and
ammunition
and
knapsacks
and
billets
and
routes
and
there
was
no
possibility
even
in
the
present
chivalrous
disposition
of
our
hero
to
enter
upon
the
defence
of
the
lady
isabel
indeed
in
the
regret
he
felt
for
the
approaching
and
unexpected
departure
of
his
friend
lord
colambre
forgot
the
fair
lady
but
just
when
sir
james
had
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
stopped
the
bye
my
dear
lord
i
saw
you
at
the
play
last
night
you
seemed
to
be
much
interested
do
think
me
impertinent
if
i
remind
you
of
our
conversation
when
we
were
riding
home
from
tusculum
and
if
i
warn
you
said
he
mounting
his
horse
beware
of
counterfeits
for
such
are
abroad
reining
in
his
impatient
steed
sir
james
turned
again
and
added
not
words
is
my
motto
remember
we
can
judge
better
by
the
conduct
of
people
towards
others
than
by
their
manner
towards
ourselves
chapter
vii
our
hero
was
quite
convinced
of
the
good
sense
of
his
friend
last
remark
that
it
is
safer
to
judge
of
people
by
their
conduct
to
others
than
by
their
manners
towards
ourselves
but
as
yet
he
felt
scarcely
any
interest
on
the
subject
of
lady
dashfort
or
lady
isabel
characters
however
he
inquired
and
listened
to
all
the
evidence
he
could
obtain
respecting
this
mother
and
daughter
he
heard
terrible
reports
of
the
mischief
they
had
done
in
families
the
extravagance
into
which
they
had
led
men
the
imprudence
to
say
no
worse
into
which
they
had
betrayed
women
matches
broken
off
reputations
ruined
husbands
alienated
from
their
wives
and
wives
made
jealous
of
their
husbands
but
in
some
of
these
stories
he
discovered
exaggeration
so
flagrant
as
to
make
him
doubt
the
whole
in
others
it
could
not
be
positively
determined
whether
the
mother
or
daughter
had
been
the
person
most
to
blame
lord
colambre
always
followed
the
charitable
rule
of
believing
only
half
what
the
world
says
and
here
he
thought
it
fair
to
believe
which
half
he
pleased
he
further
observed
that
though
all
joined
in
abusing
these
ladies
in
their
absence
when
present
they
seemed
universally
admired
though
everybody
cried
and
yet
everybody
visited
them
no
parties
so
crowded
as
lady
dashfort
no
party
deemed
pleasant
or
fashionable
where
lady
dashfort
or
lady
isabel
was
not
the
of
the
mother
were
everywhere
repeated
the
dress
and
air
of
the
daughter
everywhere
imitated
yet
lord
colambre
could
not
help
being
surprised
at
their
popularity
in
dublin
because
independently
of
all
moral
objections
there
were
causes
of
a
different
sort
sufficient
he
thought
to
prevent
lady
dashfort
from
being
liked
by
the
irish
indeed
by
any
society
she
in
general
affected
to
be
and
inattentive
to
the
feelings
and
opinions
of
others
careless
whom
she
offended
by
her
wit
or
by
her
decided
tone
there
are
some
persons
in
so
high
a
region
of
fashion
that
they
imagine
themselves
above
the
thunder
of
vulgar
censure
lady
dashfort
felt
herself
in
this
exalted
situation
and
fancied
she
might
the
innocuous
thunder
roll
below
her
rank
was
so
high
that
none
could
dare
to
call
her
vulgar
what
would
have
been
gross
in
any
one
of
meaner
note
in
her
was
freedom
or
originality
or
lady
dashfort
way
it
was
lady
dashfort
pleasure
and
pride
to
show
her
power
in
perverting
the
public
taste
she
often
said
to
those
english
companions
with
whom
she
was
intimate
see
what
follies
i
can
lead
these
fools
into
hear
the
nonsense
i
can
make
them
repeat
as
wit
upon
some
occasion
one
of
her
friends
ventured
to
fear
that
something
she
had
said
was
too
strong
strong
was
it
well
i
like
to
be
strong
woe
be
to
the
weak
on
another
occasion
she
was
told
that
certain
visitors
had
seen
her
ladyship
yawning
did
i
glad
of
it
the
yawn
sent
them
away
or
i
should
have
snored
rude
was
i
they
wo
complain
to
say
i
was
rude
to
them
would
be
to
say
that
i
did
not
think
it
worth
my
while
to
be
otherwise
barbarians
are
not
we
the
civilised
english
come
to
teach
them
manners
and
fashions
whoever
does
not
conform
and
swear
allegiance
too
we
shall
keep
out
of
the
english
pale
lady
dashfort
forced
her
way
and
she
set
the
fashion
fashion
which
converts
the
ugliest
dress
into
what
is
beautiful
and
charming
governs
the
public
mode
in
morals
and
in
manners
and
thus
when
great
talents
and
high
rank
combine
they
can
debase
or
elevate
the
public
taste
with
lord
colambre
she
played
more
artfully
she
drew
him
out
in
defence
of
his
beloved
country
and
gave
him
opportunities
of
appearing
to
advantage
this
he
could
not
help
feeling
especially
when
the
lady
isabel
was
present
lady
dashfort
had
dealt
long
enough
with
human
nature
to
know
that
to
make
any
man
pleased
with
her
she
should
begin
by
making
him
pleased
with
himself
insensibly
the
antipathy
that
lord
colambre
had
originally
felt
to
lady
dashfort
wore
off
her
faults
he
began
to
think
were
assumed
he
pardoned
her
defiance
of
good
breeding
when
he
observed
that
she
could
when
she
chose
it
be
most
engagingly
polite
it
was
not
that
she
did
not
know
what
was
right
but
that
she
did
not
think
it
always
for
her
interest
to
practise
it
the
party
opposed
to
lady
dashfort
affirmed
that
her
wit
depended
merely
on
unexpectedness
a
characteristic
which
may
be
applied
to
any
impropriety
of
speech
manner
or
conduct
in
some
of
her
ladyship
repartees
however
lord
colambre
now
acknowledged
there
was
more
than
unexpectedness
there
was
real
wit
but
it
was
of
a
sort
utterly
unfit
for
a
woman
and
he
was
sorry
that
lady
isabel
should
hear
it
in
short
exceptionable
as
it
was
altogether
lady
dashfort
conversation
had
become
entertaining
to
him
and
though
he
could
never
esteem
or
feel
in
the
least
interested
about
her
he
began
to
allow
that
she
could
be
agreeable
i
knew
how
it
would
be
said
she
when
some
of
her
friends
told
her
this
began
by
detesting
me
and
did
i
not
tell
you
that
if
i
thought
it
worth
my
while
to
make
him
like
me
he
must
sooner
or
later
i
delight
in
seeing
people
begin
with
me
as
they
do
with
olives
making
all
manner
of
horrid
faces
and
silly
protestations
that
they
will
never
touch
an
olive
again
as
long
as
they
live
but
after
a
little
time
these
very
folk
grow
so
desperately
fond
of
olives
that
there
is
no
dessert
without
them
isabel
child
you
are
in
the
sweet
line
but
sweets
cloy
you
never
heard
of
anybody
living
on
marmalade
did
ye
lady
isabel
answered
by
a
sweet
do
you
justice
you
play
lydia
languish
vastly
well
pursued
the
mother
lydia
by
herself
would
soon
tire
somebody
must
keep
up
the
spirit
and
bustle
and
carry
on
the
plot
of
the
piece
and
i
am
that
somebody
as
you
shall
see
is
not
that
our
hero
voice
which
i
hear
on
the
stairs
it
was
lord
colambre
his
lordship
had
by
this
time
become
a
constant
visitor
at
lady
dashfort
not
that
he
had
forgotten
or
that
he
meant
to
disregard
his
friend
sir
james
brooke
parting
words
he
promised
himself
faithfully
that
if
anything
should
occur
to
give
him
reason
to
suspect
designs
such
as
those
to
which
the
warning
pointed
he
would
be
on
his
guard
and
would
prove
his
generalship
by
an
able
retreat
but
to
imagine
attacks
where
none
were
attempted
to
suspect
ambuscades
in
the
open
country
would
be
ridiculous
and
cowardly
thought
our
hero
forfend
i
should
be
such
a
coxcomb
as
to
fancy
every
woman
who
speaks
to
me
has
designs
upon
my
precious
heart
or
on
my
more
precious
estate
as
he
walked
from
his
hotel
to
lady
dashfort
house
ingeniously
wrong
he
came
to
this
conclusion
just
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
and
just
as
her
ladyship
had
settled
her
future
plan
of
operations
after
talking
over
the
nothings
of
the
day
and
after
having
given
two
or
three
cuts
at
the
society
of
dublin
with
two
or
three
compliments
to
individuals
who
she
knew
were
favourites
with
his
lordship
she
suddenly
turned
to
him
lord
i
think
you
told
me
or
my
own
sagacity
discovered
that
you
want
to
see
something
of
ireland
and
that
you
do
intend
like
most
travellers
to
turn
round
see
nothing
and
go
home
content
lord
colambre
assured
her
ladyship
that
she
had
judged
him
rightly
for
that
nothing
would
content
him
but
seeing
all
that
was
possible
to
be
seen
of
his
native
country
it
was
for
this
special
purpose
he
came
to
ireland
well
very
good
purpose
ca
be
better
but
now
how
to
accomplish
it
you
know
the
portuguese
proverb
says
you
go
to
hell
for
the
good
things
you
intend
to
do
and
to
heaven
for
those
you
do
now
let
us
see
what
you
will
do
dublin
i
suppose
you
seen
enough
of
by
this
time
through
and
through
round
and
round
this
makes
me
first
giddy
and
then
sick
let
me
show
you
the
country
not
the
face
of
it
but
the
body
of
it
the
people
not
castle
this
or
newtown
that
but
their
inhabitants
i
know
them
i
have
the
key
or
the
picklock
to
their
minds
an
irishman
is
as
different
an
animal
on
his
guard
and
off
his
guard
as
a
miss
in
school
from
a
miss
out
of
school
a
fine
country
for
game
i
show
you
and
if
you
are
a
good
marksman
you
may
have
plenty
of
shots
at
folly
as
it
flies
lord
colambre
smiled
to
isabel
pursued
her
ladyship
shall
put
her
in
charge
of
heathcock
who
is
going
with
us
she
wo
thank
me
for
that
but
you
will
nay
no
fibs
man
you
know
i
know
as
who
does
not
that
has
seen
the
world
that
though
a
pretty
woman
is
a
mighty
pretty
thing
yet
she
is
confoundedly
in
one
way
when
anything
else
is
to
be
seen
heard
or
understood
every
objection
anticipated
and
removed
and
so
far
a
prospect
held
out
of
attaining
all
the
information
he
desired
with
more
than
all
the
amusement
he
could
have
expected
lord
colambre
seemed
much
tempted
to
accept
the
invitation
but
he
hesitated
because
as
he
said
her
ladyship
might
be
going
to
pay
visits
where
he
was
not
acquainted
you
do
let
that
be
a
in
the
way
of
your
tender
conscience
i
am
going
to
killpatrickstown
where
you
be
as
welcome
as
light
you
know
them
they
know
you
at
least
you
shall
have
a
proper
letter
of
invitation
from
my
lord
and
my
lady
killpatrick
and
all
that
and
as
to
the
rest
you
know
a
young
man
is
always
welcome
a
young
nobleman
kindly
welcome
i
wo
say
such
a
young
man
and
such
a
young
nobleman
for
that
might
put
you
to
pour
bows
or
your
blushes
but
nobilitas
by
itself
nobility
is
enough
in
all
parties
in
all
families
where
there
are
girls
and
of
course
balls
as
there
are
always
at
killpatrickstown
do
be
alarmed
you
shall
not
be
forced
to
dance
or
asked
to
marry
i
be
your
security
you
shall
be
at
full
liberty
and
it
is
a
house
where
you
can
do
just
what
you
will
indeed
i
go
to
no
others
these
killpatricks
are
the
best
creatures
in
the
world
they
think
nothing
good
or
grand
enough
for
me
if
i
let
them
they
would
lay
down
cloth
of
gold

their
bogs

i

anything
i

you
come
that
settled
and
so
it
was
settled
our
hero
went
to
killpatrickstown
here
sumptuous
and
unfinished
you
see
said
lady
dashfort
to
lord
colambre
the
day
after
their
arrival
begun
as
if
the
projectors
thought
they
had
the
command
of
the
mines
of
peru
and
ended
as
if
the
possessors
had
not
sixpence
des
arrangemens
provisatoires
temporary
expedients
in
plain
english
luxuries
enough
for
an
english
prince
of
the
blood
comforts
not
enough
for
an
english
woman
and
you
may
be
sure
that
great
repairs
and
alterations
have
gone
on
to
fit
this
house
for
our
reception
and
for
our
english
eyes
poor
people
english
visitors
in
this
point
of
view
are
horribly
expensive
to
the
irish
did
you
ever
hear
that
in
the
last
century
or
in
the
century
before
the
last
to
put
my
story
far
enough
back
so
that
it
shall
not
touch
anybody
living
when
a
certain
english
nobleman
lord
blank
a
sent
to
let
his
irish
friend
lord
blank
b
know
that
he
and
all
his
train
were
coming
over
to
pay
him
a
visit
the
irish
nobleman
blank
b
knowing
the
deplorable
condition
of
his
castle
sat
down
fairly
to
calculate
whether
it
would
cost
him
most
to
put
the
building
in
good
and
sufficient
repair
fit
to
receive
these
english
visitors
or
to
burn
it
to
the
ground
he
found
the
balance
to
be
in
favour
of
burning
which
was
wisely
accomplished
next
day
perhaps
killpatrick
would
have
done
well
to
follow
this
example
resolve
me
which
is
worst
to
be
burnt
out
of
house
and
home
or
to
be
eaten
out
of
house
and
home
in
this
house
above
and
below
stairs
including
first
and
second
table
housekeeper
room
lady
maids
room
butler
room
and
gentleman
one
hundred
and
four
people
sit
down
to
dinner
every
day
as
petito
informs
me
beside
kitchen
boys
and
what
they
call
who
never
sit
down
but
who
do
not
eat
or
waste
the
less
for
that
and
retainers
and
friends
friends
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
generation
who
must
get
their
bit
and
their
sup
for
sure
it
only
biddy
they
say
continued
lady
dashfort
imitating
their
irish
brogue
sure
is
nothing
at
all
out
of
all
his
honour
my
lord
has
how
could
he
feel
it
feel
it
become
sensible
of
it
know
it
long
life
to
him
he
not
that
way
not
a
couple
in
all
ireland
and
that
saying
a
great
dale
looks
less
after
their
own
nor
is
more
or
or
greater
nor
than
my
lord
and
my
lady
killpatrick
now
there
encouragement
for
a
lord
and
a
lady
to
ruin
themselves
lady
dashfort
imitated
the
irish
brogue
in
perfection
boasted
that
was
mistress
of
fourteen
different
brogues
and
had
brogues
for
all
occasions
by
her
mixture
of
mimickry
sarcasm
exaggeration
and
truth
she
succeeded
continually
in
making
lord
colambre
laugh
at
everything
at
which
she
wished
to
make
him
laugh
at
every
thing
but
not
every
body
whenever
she
became
personal
he
became
serious
or
at
least
endeavoured
to
become
serious
and
if
he
could
not
instantly
resume
the
command
of
his
risible
muscles
he
reproached
himself
is
shameful
to
laugh
at
these
people
indeed
lady
dashfort
in
their
own
house
these
hospitable
people
who
are
entertaining
us
us
true
and
if
we
are
entertained
how
can
we
help
laughing
all
expostulation
was
thus
turned
off
by
a
jest
as
it
was
her
pride
to
make
lord
colambre
laugh
in
spite
of
his
better
feelings
and
principles
this
he
saw
and
this
seemed
to
him
to
be
her
sole
object
but
there
he
was
mistaken
as
she
pretended
to
be
none
dealt
more
in
the
impromptu
fait
a
loisir
and
mentally
as
she
affected
to
be
none
had
more
longanimity
for
their
own
interest
it
was
her
settled
purpose
to
make
the
irish
and
ireland
ridiculous
and
contemptible
to
lord
colambre
to
disgust
him
with
his
native
country
to
make
him
abandon
the
wish
of
residing
on
his
own
estate
to
confirm
him
an
absentee
was
her
object
previously
to
her
ultimate
plan
of
marrying
him
to
her
daughter
her
daughter
was
poor
she
would
therefore
be
glad
to
get
an
irish
peer
for
her
but
would
be
very
sorry
she
said
to
see
isabel
banished
to
ireland
and
the
young
widow
declared
she
could
never
bring
herself
to
be
buried
alive
in
clonbrony
castle
in
addition
to
these
considerations
lady
dashfort
received
certain
hints
from
petito
which
worked
all
to
the
same
point
yes
my
lady
i
heard
a
great
deal
about
all
that
when
i
was
at
lady
clonbrony
said
petito
one
day
as
she
was
attending
at
her
lady
toilette
and
encouraged
to
begin
chattering
i
own
i
was
originally
under
the
universal
error
that
my
lord
colambre
was
to
be
married
to
the
great
heiress
miss
broadhurst
but
i
have
been
converted
and
reformed
on
that
score
and
am
at
present
quite
in
another
way
and
style
of
thinking
petito
paused
in
hopes
that
her
lady
would
ask
what
was
her
present
way
of
thinking
but
lady
dashfort
certain
that
she
would
tell
her
without
being
asked
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
speak
particularly
as
she
did
not
choose
to
appear
violently
interested
on
the
present
way
of
thinking
resumed
petito
in
consequence
of
my
having
with
my
own
eyes
and
ears
witnessed
and
overheard
his
lordship
behaviour
and
words
the
morning
he
was
coming
away
from
lunnun
for
ireland
when
he
was
morally
certain
nobody
was
up
nor
overhearing
nor
overseeing
him
there
did
i
notice
him
my
lady
stopping
in
the
antechamber
ejaculating
over
one
of
miss
nugent
gloves
which
he
had
picked
up
limerick
said
he
quite
loud
to
himself
for
it
was
a
limerick
glove
my
lady
limerick
dear
ireland
she
loves
you
as
well
as
i
do
or
words
to
that
effect
and
then
a
sigh
and
downstairs
and
off
so
thinks
i
now
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
and
i
would
give
much
myself
for
miss
broadhurst
chance
of
that
young
lord
with
all
her
bank
stock
scrip
and
omnum
now
i
see
how
the
land
lies
and
i
sorry
for
it
for
she
no
fortin
and
she
so
proud
she
never
said
a
hint
to
me
of
the
matter
but
my
lord
colambre
is
a
sweet
gentleman
and
do
run
on
so
you
must
not
meddle
with
what
you
do
understand
the
miss
killpatricks
to
be
sure
are
sweet
girls
particularly
the
youngest
her
ladyship
toilette
was
finished
and
she
left
petito
to
go
down
to
my
lady
killpatrick
woman
to
tell
as
a
very
great
secret
the
schemes
that
were
in
contemplation
among
the
higher
powers
in
favour
of
the
youngest
of
the
miss
killpatricks
ireland
is
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
is
it
repeated
lady
dashfort
to
herself
shall
not
be
long
so
from
this
time
forward
not
a
day
scarcely
an
hour
passed
but
her
ladyship
did
or
said
something
to
depreciate
the
country
or
its
inhabitants
in
our
hero
estimation
with
treacherous
ability
she
knew
and
followed
all
the
arts
of
misrepresentation
all
those
injurious
arts
which
his
friend
sir
james
brooke
had
with
such
honest
indignation
reprobated
she
knew
how
not
only
to
seize
the
ridiculous
points
to
make
the
most
respectable
people
ridiculous
but
she
knew
how
to
select
the
worst
instances
the
worst
exceptions
and
to
produce
them
as
examples
as
precedents
from
which
to
condemn
whole
classes
and
establish
general
false
conclusions
respecting
a
nation
in
the
neighbourhood
of
killpatrickstown
lady
dashfort
said
there
were
several
squireens
or
little
squires
a
race
of
men
who
have
succeeded
to
the
buckeens
described
by
young
and
crumpe
squireens
are
persons
who
with
good
long
leases
or
valuable
farms
possess
incomes
from
three
to
eight
hundred
a
year
who
keep
a
pack
of
hounds
take
out
a
commission
of
the
peace
sometimes
before
they
can
spell
as
her
ladyship
said
and
almost
always
before
they
know
anything
of
law
or
justice
busy
and
loud
about
small
matters
jobbers
at
assizes
combining
with
one
another
and
trying
upon
every
occasion
public
or
private
to
push
themselves
forward
to
the
annoyance
of
their
superiors
and
the
terror
of
those
below
them
in
the
usual
course
of
things
these
men
are
not
often
to
be
found
in
the
society
of
gentry
except
perhaps
among
those
gentlemen
or
noblemen
who
like
to
see
at
their
tables
or
who
find
it
for
their
convenience
to
have
underling
magistrates
to
protect
their
favourites
or
to
propose
and
carry
jobs
for
them
on
grand
juries
at
election
times
however
these
persons
rise
into
sudden
importance
with
all
who
have
views
upon
the
county
lady
dashfort
hinted
to
lord
killpatrick
that
her
private
letters
from
england
spoke
of
an
approaching
dissolution
of
parliament
she
knew
that
upon
this
hint
a
round
of
invitations
would
be
sent
to
the
squireens
and
she
was
morally
certain
that
they
would
be
more
disagreeable
to
lord
colambre
and
give
him
a
worse
idea
of
the
country
than
any
other
people
who
could
be
produced
day
after
day
some
of
these
personages
made
their
appearance
and
lady
dashfort
took
care
to
draw
them
out
upon
the
subjects
on
which
she
knew
that
they
would
show
the
most
ignorance
and
the
most
illiberal
spirit
this
succeeded
beyond
her
most
sanguine
expectations
colambre
how
i
pity
you
for
being
compelled
to
these
permanent
sittings
after
dinner
said
lady
isabel
to
him
one
night
when
he
came
late
to
the
ladies
from
the
killpatrick
insisted
upon
my
staying
to
help
him
to
push
about
that
electioneering
bottle
said
lord
colambre
if
that
were
all
if
these
gentlemen
would
only
drink
but
their
conversation
i
do
wonder
my
mother
dreads
returning
to
clonbrony
castle
if
my
father
must
have
such
company
as
this
but
surely
it
can
not
be
necessary
indispensable
positively
indispensable
cried
lady
dashfort
living
in
ireland
without
it
you
know
in
every
country
in
the
world
you
must
live
with
the
people
of
the
country
or
be
torn
to
pieces
for
my
part
i
should
prefer
being
torn
to
pieces
lady
dashfort
and
lady
isabel
knew
how
to
take
advantage
of
the
contrast
between
their
own
conversation
and
that
of
the
persons
by
whom
lord
colambre
was
so
justly
disgusted
they
happily
relieved
his
fatigue
with
wit
satire
poetry
and
sentiment
so
that
he
every
day
became
more
exclusively
fond
of
their
company
for
lady
killpatrick
and
the
miss
killpatricks
were
mere
commonplace
people
in
the
mornings
he
rode
or
walked
with
lady
dashfort
and
lady
isabel
lady
dashfort
by
way
of
fulfilling
her
promise
of
showing
him
the
people
used
frequently
to
take
him
into
the
cabins
and
talk
to
their
inhabitants
lord
and
lady
killpatrick
who
had
lived
always
for
the
fashionable
world
had
taken
little
pains
to
improve
the
condition
of
their
tenants
the
few
attempts
they
had
made
were
injudicious
they
had
built
ornamented
picturesque
cottages
within
view
of
their
demesne
and
favourite
followers
of
the
family
people
with
half
a
century
habit
of
indolence
and
dirt
were
promoted
to
these
fine
dwellings
the
consequences
were
such
as
lady
dashfort
delighted
to
point
out
everything
let
to
go
to
ruin
for
the
want
of
a
moment
care
or
pulled
to
pieces
for
the
sake
of
the
most
trifling
surreptitious
profit
the
people
most
assisted
always
appearing
proportionally
wretched
and
discontented
no
one
could
with
more
ease
and
more
knowledge
of
her
ground
than
lady
dashfort
do
the
dishonour
of
a
country
in
every
cabin
that
she
entered
by
the
first
glance
of
her
eye
at
the
head
kerchiefed
in
no
comely
guise
or
by
the
corners
of
the
mouth
or
by
the
bit
of
a
broken
pipe
which
in
ireland
never
characterises
stout
labour
or
by
the
first
sound
of
the
voice
the
drawling
accent
on
honour
or
lady
she
could
distinguish
the
proper
objects
of
her
charitable
designs
that
is
to
say
those
of
the
old
uneducated
race
whom
no
one
can
help
because
they
will
never
help
themselves
to
these
she
constantly
addressed
herself
making
them
give
in
all
their
despairing
tones
a
history
of
their
complaints
and
grievances
then
asking
them
questions
aptly
contrived
to
expose
their
habits
of
their
servility
and
flattery
one
moment
and
their
litigious
and
encroaching
spirit
the
next
thus
giving
lord
colambre
the
most
unfavourable
idea
of
the
disposition
and
character
of
the
lower
class
of
the
irish
people
lady
isabel
the
while
standing
by
with
the
most
amiable
air
of
pity
with
expressions
of
the
finest
moral
sensibility
softening
all
her
mother
said
finding
ever
some
excuse
for
the
poor
creatures
and
following
with
angelic
sweetness
to
heal
the
wounds
her
mother
inflicted
when
lady
dashfort
thought
she
had
sufficiently
worked
upon
lord
colambre
mind
to
weaken
his
enthusiasm
for
his
native
country
and
when
lady
isabel
had
by
the
appearance
of
every
virtue
added
to
a
delicate
preference
if
not
partiality
for
our
hero
ingratiated
herself
into
his
good
opinion
and
obtained
an
interest
in
his
mind
the
wily
mother
ventured
an
attack
of
a
more
decisive
nature
and
so
contrived
it
was
that
if
it
failed
it
should
appear
to
have
been
made
without
design
to
injure
and
in
total
ignorance
one
day
lady
dashfort
who
in
fact
was
not
proud
of
her
family
though
she
pretended
to
be
so
had
herself
prevailed
on
though
with
much
difficulty
by
lady
killpatrick
to
do
the
very
thing
she
wanted
to
do
to
show
her
genealogy
which
had
been
beautifully
blazoned
and
which
was
to
be
produced
as
evidence
in
the
lawsuit
that
brought
her
to
ireland
lord
colambre
stood
politely
looking
on
and
listening
while
her
ladyship
explained
the
splendid
of
her
family
pointing
to
each
medallion
that
was
filled
gloriously
with
noble
and
even
with
royal
names
till
at
last
she
stopped
short
and
covering
one
medallion
with
her
finger
she
said
over
that
dear
lady
killpatrick
you
are
not
to
see
that
lord
colambre
that
a
little
blot
in
our
scutcheon
you
know
isabel
we
never
talk
of
that
prudent
match
of
john
what
could
he
expect
by
marrying
into
that
family
where
you
know
all
the
men
were
not
sans
peur
and
none
of
the
women
sans
reproche
mamma
cried
lady
isabel
one
exception
one
isabel
persisted
lady
dashfort
was
lady
and
the
other
sister
that
married
the
man
with
the
long
nose
and
the
daughter
again
of
whom
they
contrived
to
make
an
honest
woman
by
getting
her
married
in
time
to
a
and
who
contrived
to
get
herself
into
doctors
commons
the
very
next
year
dear
mamma
that
is
enough
and
too
much
oh
pray
do
go
on
cried
lady
isabel
who
had
appeared
very
much
distressed
during
her
mother
speech
do
know
what
you
are
saying
indeed
you
do
likely
child
but
that
compliment
i
can
return
to
you
on
the
spot
and
with
interest
for
you
seem
to
me
at
this
instant
not
to
know
either
what
you
are
saying
or
what
you
are
doing
come
come
explain
no
pray
say
so
no
more
i
will
explain
myself
another
time
there
you
are
wrong
isabel
in
point
of
anything
is
better
than
hints
and
mystery
since
i
have
been
so
unlucky
as
to
touch
upon
the
subject
better
go
through
with
it
and
with
all
the
boldness
of
innocence
ask
the
question
are
you
my
lord
colambre
or
are
you
not
related
or
connected
with
any
of
the
st
omars
that
i
know
of
said
lord
colambre
i
really
am
so
bad
a
genealogist
that
i
can
not
answer
positively
i
must
put
the
substance
of
my
question
into
a
new
form
have
you
or
have
you
not
a
cousin
of
the
name
of
nugent
nugent
grace
nugent
yes
said
lord
colambre
with
as
much
firmness
of
voice
as
he
could
command
and
with
as
little
change
of
countenance
as
possible
but
as
the
question
came
upon
him
so
unexpectedly
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
answer
with
an
air
of
absolute
indifference
and
composure
her
mother
was
said
lady
dashfort
aunt
by
marriage
her
maiden
name
was
reynolds
i
think
but
she
died
when
i
was
quite
a
child
i
know
very
little
about
her
i
never
saw
her
in
my
life
but
i
am
certain
she
was
a
reynolds
my
dear
lord
continued
lady
dashfort
am
perfectly
aware
that
she
did
take
and
bear
the
name
of
reynolds
but
that
was
not
her
maiden
name
her
maiden
name
was
but
perhaps
it
is
a
family
secret
that
has
been
kept
for
some
good
reason
from
you
and
from
the
poor
girl
herself
the
maiden
name
was
omar
depend
upon
it
nay
i
would
not
have
told
this
to
you
my
lord
if
i
could
have
conceived
that
it
would
affect
you
so
violently
pursued
lady
dashfort
in
a
tone
of
raillery
see
you
are
no
worse
off
than
we
are
we
have
an
intermarriage
with
the
omars
i
did
not
think
you
would
be
so
much
shocked
at
a
discovery
which
proves
that
our
family
and
yours
have
some
little
connexion
lord
colambre
endeavoured
to
answer
and
mechanically
said
something
about
to
have
the
honour
lady
dashfort
truly
happy
to
see
that
her
blow
had
hit
the
mark
so
well
turned
from
his
lordship
without
seeming
to
observe
how
seriously
he
was
affected
and
lady
isabel
sighed
and
looked
with
compassion
on
lord
colambre
and
then
reproachfully
at
her
mother
but
lord
colambre
heeded
not
her
looks
and
heard
not
of
her
sighs
he
heard
nothing
saw
nothing
though
his
eyes
were
intently
fixed
on
the
genealogy
on
which
lady
dashfort
was
still
descanting
to
lady
killpatrick
he
took
the
first
opportunity
he
could
of
quitting
the
room
and
went
out
to
take
a
solitary
walk
he
is
departed
but
not
in
peace
to
reflect
upon
what
has
been
said
whispered
lady
dashfort
to
her
daughter
hope
it
will
do
him
a
vast
deal
of
good
of
the
women
sans
reproche
none
without
one
exception
said
lord
colambre
to
himself
grace
nugent
mother
a
st
omar
is
it
possible
lady
dashfort
seems
certain
she
could
not
assert
a
positive
falsehood
no
motive
she
does
not
know
that
miss
nugent
is
the
person
to
whom
i
am
attached
she
spoke
at
random
and
i
have
heard
it
first
from
a
stranger
not
from
my
mother
why
was
it
kept
secret
from
me
now
i
understand
the
reason
why
my
mother
evidently
never
wished
that
i
should
think
of
miss
nugent
why
she
always
spoke
so
vehemently
against
the
marriages
of
relations
of
cousins
why
not
tell
me
the
truth
it
would
have
had
the
strongest
effect
had
she
known
my
mind
lord
colambre
had
the
greatest
dread
of
marrying
any
woman
whose
mother
had
conducted
herself
his
reason
his
prejudices
his
pride
his
delicacy
and
even
his
limited
experience
were
all
against
it
all
his
hopes
his
plans
of
future
happiness
were
shaken
to
their
very
foundation
he
felt
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
that
stunned
his
mind
and
from
which
he
could
not
recover
his
faculties
the
whole
of
that
day
he
was
like
one
in
a
dream
at
night
the
painful
idea
continually
recurred
to
him
and
whenever
he
was
falling
asleep
the
sound
of
lady
dashfort
voice
returned
upon
his
ear
saying
the
words
could
he
expect
when
he
married
one
of
the
omars
none
of
the
women
sans
reproche
in
the
morning
he
rose
early
and
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
write
a
letter
to
his
mother
requesting
unless
there
was
some
important
reason
for
her
declining
to
answer
the
question
that
she
would
immediately
relieve
his
mind
from
a
great
uneasiness
he
altered
the
word
four
times
but
at
last
left
it
uneasiness
he
stated
what
he
had
heard
and
besought
his
mother
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
without
reserve
chapter
viii
one
morning
lady
dashfort
had
formed
an
ingenious
scheme
for
leaving
lady
isabel
and
lord
colambre
but
the
sudden
entrance
of
heathcock
disconcerted
her
intentions
he
came
to
beg
lady
dashfort
interest
with
count
for
permission
to
hunt
and
shoot
on
his
for
myself
honour
but
for
two
officers
who
are
quartered
at
the
next
town
here
who
will
indubitably
hang
or
drown
themselves
if
they
are
debarred
from
sporting

this
count
said
lord
colambre
miss
white
lady
killpatrick
companion
said
was
a
great
oddity
lady
dashfort
he
was
singular
and
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
who
was
at
breakfast
declared
he
was
a
man
of
uncommon
knowledge
merit
and
politeness
i
know
of
him
said
heathcock
that
he
is
a
great
sportsman
with
a
long
queue
a
hat
and
long
skirts
to
a
laced
waistcoat
lord
colambre
expressed
a
wish
to
see
this
extraordinary
personage
and
lady
dashfort
to
cover
her
former
design
and
perhaps
thinking
absence
might
be
as
effectual
as
too
much
propinquity
immediately
offered
to
call
upon
the
officers
in
their
way
and
carry
them
with
heathcock
and
lord
colambre
to
halloran
castle
lady
isabel
retired
with
much
mortification
but
with
becoming
grace
and
captain
benson
and
captain
williamson
were
taken
to
the
count
captain
benson
who
was
a
famous
whip
took
his
seat
on
the
box
of
the
barouche
and
the
rest
of
the
party
had
the
pleasure
of
her
ladyship
conversation
for
three
or
four
miles
of
her
ladyship
conversation
for
lord
colambre
thoughts
were
far
distant
captain
williamson
had
not
anything
to
say
and
heathcock
nothing
but
now
honour
they
arrived
at
halloran
castle
a
fine
old
building
part
of
it
in
ruins
and
part
repaired
with
great
judgment
and
taste
when
the
carriage
stopped
a
appeared
on
the
steps
at
the
open
count
was
out
but
his
servant
said
he
would
be
at
home
immediately
if
lady
dashfort
and
the
gentlemen
would
be
pleased
to
walk
in
on
one
side
of
the
lofty
and
spacious
hall
stood
the
skeleton
of
an
elk
on
the
other
side
the
perfect
skeleton
of
a
which
as
the
servant
said
his
master
had
made
out
with
great
care
from
the
different
bones
of
many
of
this
curious
species
of
deer
found
in
the
lakes
in
the
neighbourhood
the
brace
of
officers
witnessed
their
wonder
with
sundry
strange
oaths
and
honour
now
said
heathcock
and
too
genteel
to
wonder
at
or
admire
anything
in
the
creation
dragged
out
his
watch
with
some
difficulty
saying
wonder
now
whether
they
are
likely
to
think
of
giving
us
anything
to
eat
in
this
place
and
turning
his
back
upon
the
he
straight
walked
out
again
upon
the
steps
called
to
his
groom
and
began
to
make
some
inquiry
about
his
led
horse
lord
colambre
surveyed
the
prodigious
skeletons
with
rational
curiosity
and
with
that
sense
of
awe
and
admiration
by
which
a
superior
mind
is
always
struck
on
beholding
any
of
the
great
works
of
providence
my
dear
lord
said
lady
dashfort
our
sublime
sensations
we
are
keeping
my
old
friend
alick
brady
this
venerable
person
waiting
to
show
us
into
the
the
servant
bowed
respectfully
more
respectfully
than
servants
of
modern
date
lady
the
has
been
lately
painted
the
smell
of
paint
may
be
disagreeable
with
your
leave
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
showing
you
into
my
master
study
he
opened
the
door
went
in
before
her
and
stood
holding
up
his
finger
as
if
making
a
signal
of
silence
to
some
one
within
her
ladyship
entered
and
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
an
odd
assembly
an
eagle
a
goat
a
dog
an
otter
several
gold
and
silver
fish
in
a
glass
globe
and
a
white
mouse
in
a
cage
the
eagle
quick
of
eye
but
quiet
of
demeanour
was
perched
upon
his
stand
the
otter
lay
under
the
table
perfectly
harmless
the
angora
goat
a
beautiful
and
remarkably
little
creature
of
its
kind
with
long
curling
silky
hair
was
walking
about
the
room
with
the
air
of
a
beauty
and
a
favourite
the
dog
a
tall
irish
greyhound
one
of
the
few
of
that
fine
race
which
is
now
almost
extinct
had
been
given
to
count
by
an
irish
nobleman
a
relation
of
lady
dashfort
this
dog
who
had
formerly
known
her
ladyship
looked
at
her
with
ears
erect
recognised
her
and
went
to
meet
her
the
moment
she
entered
the
servant
answered
for
the
peaceable
behaviour
of
all
the
rest
of
the
company
of
animals
and
retired
lady
dashfort
began
to
feed
the
eagle
from
a
silver
plate
on
his
stand
lord
colambre
examined
the
inscription
on
his
collar
the
other
men
stood
in
amaze
heathcock
who
came
in
last
astonished
out
of
his
constant
now
the
moment
he
put
himself
in
at
the
door
exclaimed
what
all
this
live
lumber
and
he
stumbled
over
the
goat
who
was
at
that
moment
crossing
the
way
the
colonel
spur
caught
in
the
goat
curly
beard
the
colonel
shook
his
foot
and
entangled
the
spur
worse
and
worse
the
goat
struggled
and
butted
the
colonel
skated
forward
on
the
polished
oak
floor
balancing
himself
with
outstretched
arms
the
indignant
eagle
screamed
and
passing
by
perched
on
heathcock
shoulders
too
to
have
recourse
to
the
terrors
of
his
beak
he
scrupled
not
to
scream
and
flap
his
wings
about
the
colonel
ears
lady
dashfort
the
while
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
laughing
and
begging
heathcock
pardon
take
care
of
the
dog
my
dear
colonel
cried
she
this
kind
of
dog
seizes
his
enemy
by
the
back
and
shakes
him
to
death
the
officers
holding
their
sides
laughed
and
begged
no
pardon
while
lord
colambre
the
only
person
who
was
not
absolutely
incapacitated
tried
to
disentangle
the
spur
and
to
liberate
the
colonel
from
the
goat
and
the
goat
from
the
colonel
an
attempt
in
which
he
at
last
succeeded
at
the
expense
of
a
considerable
portion
of
the
goat
beard
the
eagle
however
still
kept
his
place
and
yet
mindful
of
the
wrongs
of
his
insulted
friend
the
goat
had
stretched
his
wings
to
give
another
buffet
count
entered
and
the
bird
quitting
his
prey
flew
down
to
greet
his
master
the
count
was
a
fine
old
gentleman
fresh
from
the
chace
his
hunting
accoutrements
hanging
carelessly
about
him
he
advanced
unembarrassed
to
the
lady
and
received
his
other
guests
with
a
mixture
of
military
ease
and
dignity
without
adverting
to
the
awkward
and
ridiculous
situation
in
which
he
had
found
poor
heathcock
he
apologised
in
general
for
his
troublesome
favourites
one
of
them
said
he
patting
the
head
of
the
dog
which
lay
quiet
at
lady
dashfort
feet
see
i
have
no
need
to
apologise
he
is
where
he
ought
to
be
poor
fellow
he
has
never
lost
his
taste
for
the
good
company
to
which
he
was
early
accustomed
as
to
the
rest
said
he
turning
to
lady
dashfort
mouse
a
bird
and
a
fish
are
you
know
tribute
from
earth
air
and
water
for
my
conqueror
from
no
barbarous
scythian
said
lord
colambre
smiling
the
count
looked
at
lord
colambre
as
at
a
person
worthy
his
attention
but
his
first
care
was
to
keep
the
peace
between
his
loving
subjects
and
his
foreign
visitors
it
was
difficult
to
dislodge
the
old
settlers
to
make
room
for
the
newcomers
but
he
adjusted
these
things
with
admirable
facility
and
with
a
master
hand
and
master
eye
compelled
each
favourite
to
retreat
into
the
back
settlements
with
becoming
attention
he
stroked
and
kept
quiet
old
victory
his
eagle
who
eyed
colonel
heathcock
still
as
if
he
did
not
like
him
and
whom
the
colonel
eyed
as
if
he
wished
his
neck
fairly
wrung
off
the
little
goat
had
nestled
himself
close
up
to
his
liberator
lord
colambre
and
lay
perfectly
quiet
with
his
eyes
closed
going
very
wisely
to
sleep
and
submitting
philosophically
to
the
loss
of
one
half
of
his
beard
conversation
now
commenced
and
was
carried
on
by
count
with
much
ability
and
spirit
and
with
such
quickness
of
discrimination
and
delicacy
of
taste
as
quite
surprised
and
delighted
our
hero
to
the
lady
the
count
attention
was
first
directed
he
listened
to
her
as
she
spoke
bending
with
an
air
of
deference
and
devotion
she
made
her
request
for
permission
for
major
benson
and
captain
williamson
to
hunt
and
shoot
in
his
grounds
this
was
instantly
granted
ladyship
requests
were
to
him
commands
the
count
said
gamekeeper
should
be
instructed
to
give
the
gentlemen
her
friends
every
liberty
and
all
possible
assistance
then
turning
to
the
officers
he
said
he
had
just
heard
that
several
regiments
of
english
militia
had
lately
landed
in
ireland
that
one
regiment
was
arrived
at
killpatrickstown
he
rejoiced
in
the
advantages
ireland
and
he
hoped
he
might
be
permitted
to
add
england
would
probably
derive
from
the
exchange
of
the
militia
of
both
countries
habits
would
be
improved
ideas
enlarged
the
two
countries
have
the
same
interest
and
from
the
inhabitants
discovering
more
of
each
other
good
qualities
and
interchanging
little
good
offices
in
common
life
their
esteem
and
affection
for
each
other
would
increase
and
rest
upon
the
firm
basis
of
mutual
utility
to
all
this
major
benson
and
captain
williamson
made
no
reply
major
looks
so
like
a
stuffed
man
of
straw
whispered
lady
dashfort
to
lord
colambre
the
captain
so
like
the
knave
of
clubs
putting
forth
one
manly
leg
count
now
turned
the
conversation
to
field
sports
and
then
the
captain
and
major
opened
at
once
now
sir
said
the
major
in
this
country
i
suppose
and
now
do
you
manage
the
thing
here
as
we
do
over
night
you
know
before
the
hunt
when
the
fox
is
out
stopping
up
the
earths
of
the
cover
we
mean
to
draw
and
all
the
rest
for
four
miles
round
next
morning
we
assemble
at
the
cover
side
and
the
huntsman
throws
in
the
hounds
the
gossip
here
is
no
small
part
of
the
entertainment
but
as
soon
as
we
hear
the
hounds
give
tongue
favourite
hounds
interposed
williamson
favourite
hounds
to
be
sure
continued
benson
is
a
dead
silence
till
pug
is
well
out
of
cover
and
the
whole
pack
well
in
then
cheer
the
hounds
with
till
your
lungs
crack
away
he
goes
in
gallant
style
and
the
whole
field
is
hard
up
till
pug
takes
a
stiff
country
then
they
who
have
pluck
lag
see
no
more
of
him
and
with
a
fine
blazing
scent
there
are
but
few
of
us
in
at
the
death
we
are
fairly
in
at
the
death
i
hope
said
lady
dashfort
was
thrown
out
sadly
at
one
time
in
the
chace
lord
colambre
with
the
count
permission
took
up
a
book
in
which
the
count
pencil
lay
pasley
on
the
military
policy
of
great
britain
it
was
marked
with
many
notes
of
admiration
and
with
hands
pointing
to
remarkable
passages
is
a
book
that
leaves
a
strong
impression
on
the
mind
said
the
count
lord
colambre
read
one
of
the
marked
passages
beginning
with
that
distinguishes
a
soldier
in
outward
appearance
from
a
citizen
is
so
trifling
but
at
this
instant
our
hero
attention
was
distracted
by
seeing
in
a
book
this
title
of
a
chapter
of
the
nugents
now
sir
said
captain
williamson
i
do
interrupt
you
as
you
are
such
a
famous
maybe
you
may
be
a
fisherman
too
and
now
in
ireland
do
you
a
smart
pinch
on
his
elbow
from
his
major
who
stood
behind
him
stopped
the
captain
short
as
he
pronounced
the
word
like
all
awkward
people
he
turned
directly
to
ask
by
his
looks
what
was
the
matter
the
major
took
advantage
of
his
discomfiture
and
stepping
before
him
determined
to
have
the
fishing
to
himself
and
went
on
with
i
presume
you
understand
fishing
too
as
well
as
hunting
the
count
bowed
do
not
presume
to
say
that
sir
pray
count
in
this
country
do
you
arm
your
hook
this
ways
give
me
leave
taking
the
whip
from
williamson
reluctant
hand
ways
laying
the
outermost
part
of
your
feather
this
fashion
next
to
your
hook
and
the
point
next
to
your
shank
this
wise
and
that
wise
and
then
sir
count
you
take
the
hackle
of
a
cock
neck
plover
topping
better
said
williamson
work
your
gold
and
silver
thread
pursued
benson
to
your
wings
and
when
your
head
made
you
fasten
all
you
never
showed
how
your
head
made
interrupted
williamson
gentleman
knows
how
a
head
made
any
man
can
make
a
head
i
suppose
so
sir
you
fasten
all
never
get
your
head
fast
on
that
way
while
the
world
stands
cried
williamson
enough
for
all
purposes
i
bet
you
a
rump
and
dozen
captain
and
then
sir
count
you
divide
your
wings
with
a
needle
pin
point
will
do
said
williamson
the
count
to
reconcile
matters
produced
from
an
indian
cabinet
which
he
had
opened
for
the
lady
inspection
a
little
basket
containing
a
variety
of
artificial
flies
of
curious
construction
which
as
he
spread
them
on
the
table
made
williamson
and
benson
eyes
almost
sparkle
with
delight
there
was
the
for
the
month
of
march
and
the
much
in
vogue
for
april
and
the
of
red

black

and
red

lord
colambre
whose

was
in
the
of

wished
them
all
at
the
bottom
of

all
these
and

upon
the

before
the
sportsmen
wondering

honour
now
were
the
first
words
which
heathcock
had
uttered
since
his
battle
with
the
goat
dear
heathcock
are
you
alive
still
said
lady
dashfort
had
really
forgotten
your
existence
so
had
count
but
he
did
not
say
so
ladyship
has
the
advantage
of
me
there
said
heathcock
stretching
himself
wish
i
could
forget
my
existence
for
in
my
mind
existence
is
a
horrible
bore
thought
you
was
a
sportsman
said
williamson
sir
a
fisherman
sir
look
you
there
sir
pointing
to
the
flies
tell
a
body
life
a
bore
ca
always
fish
or
shoot
i
apprehend
sir
said
heathcock
always
but
sometimes
said
williamson
laughing
i
suspect
shrewdly
you
forgot
some
of
your
sporting
in
bond
street
honour
now
said
the
colonel
retreating
again
to
his
safe
entrenchment
of
affectation
from
which
he
never
could
venture
without
imminent
danger
honour
cried
lady
dashfort
can
swear
for
heathcock
that
i
have
eaten
excellent
hares
and
ducks
of
his
shooting
which
to
my
knowledge
added
she
in
a
loud
whisper
bought
in
the
market
emptum
aprum
said
lord
colambre
to
the
count
without
danger
of
being
understood
by
those
whom
it
concerned
the
count
smiled
a
second
time
but
politely
turning
the
attention
of
the
company
from
the
unfortunate
colonel
by
addressing
himself
to
the
laughing
sportsmen
you
seem
to
value
these
said
he
sweeping
the
artificial
flies
from
the
table
into
the
little
basket
from
which
they
had
been
taken
you
do
me
the
honour
to
accept
of
them
they
are
all
of
my
own
making
and
consequently
of
irish
manufacture
then
ringing
the
bell
he
asked
lady
dashfort
permission
to
have
the
basket
put
into
her
carriage
benson
and
williamson
followed
the
servant
to
prevent
them
from
being
tossed
into
the
boot
heathcock
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
taking
snuff
count
turned
from
him
to
lord
colambre
who
had
just
got
happily
to
the
of
the
nugents
when
lady
dashfort
coming
between
them
and
spying
the
title
of
the
chapter
exclaimed
have
you
there
antiquities
my
delight
but
i
never
look
at
engravings
when
i
can
see
realities
lord
colambre
was
then
compelled
to
follow
as
she
led
the
way
into
the
hall
where
the
count
took
down
golden
ornaments
and
spears
and
jointed
horns
of
curious
workmanship
that
had
been
found
on
his
estate
and
he
told
of
spermaceti
wrapped
in
carpets
and
he
showed
small
urns
enclosing
ashes
and
from
among
these
urns
he
selected
one
which
he
put
into
the
hands
of
lord
colambre
telling
him
that
it
had
been
lately
found
in
an
old
in
his
neighbourhood
which
had
been
the
of
some
of
the
nugent
family
was
just
looking
at
the
account
of
it
in
the
book
which
you
saw
open
on
my
and
as
you
seem
to
take
an
interest
in
that
family
my
lord
perhaps
said
the
count
may
think
this
urn
worth
your
acceptance
lord
colambre
said
would
be
highly
valuable
to
him
as
the
nugents
were
his
near
relations
lady
dashfort
little
expected
this
blow
she
however
carried
him
off
to
the
and
from
to
to
various
architectural
antiquities
and
to
the
real
and
fabulous
history
of
ireland
on
all
which
the
count
spoke
with
learning
and
enthusiasm
but
now
to
colonel
heathcock
great
joy
and
relief
a
handsome
collation
appeared
in
the
of
which
ulick
opened
the
you
have
made
an
excellent
house
of
your
castle
said
lady
dashfort
will
be
when
it
is
finished
said
the
count
am
afraid
added
he
smiling
live
like
many
other
irish
gentlemen
who
never
are
but
always
to
be
blest
with
a
good
house
i
began
on
too
large
a
scale
and
can
never
hope
to
live
to
finish
it
honour
here
a
good
thing
which
i
hope
we
shall
live
to
finish
said
heathcock
sitting
down
before
the
collation
and
heartily
did
he
eat
of
grouse
pie
and
of
irish
ortolans
which
as
lady
dashfort
observed
him
indemnity
for
the
past
and
security
for
the
future
now
your
irish
ortolans
are
famous
good
eating
said
heathcock
being
quartered
in
ireland
faith
to
taste
said
benson
the
count
recommended
to
lady
dashfort
some
of
delicate
sweetmeat
the
irish
plum
me
sir
count
cried
williamson
by
far
the
best
thing
of
the
kind
i
ever
tasted
in
all
my
life
where
could
you
get
this
dublin
at
my
dear
godey
where
only
in
his
majesty
dominions
it
is
to
be
had
said
the
count
the
whole
dish
vanished
in
a
few
seconds
honour
i
do
believe
this
is
the
thing
the
queen
so
fond
of
said
heathcock
then
heartily
did
he
drink
of
the
count
excellent
hungarian
wines
and
by
the
common
bond
of
sympathy
between
those
who
have
no
other
tastes
but
eating
and
drinking
the
colonel
the
major
and
the
captain
were
now
all
the
best
companions
possible
for
one
another
whilst
prolonged
the
rich
repast
lady
dashfort
and
lord
colambre
went
to
the
window
to
admire
the
prospect
lady
dashfort
asked
the
count
the
name
of
some
distant
hill
said
the
count
hill
was
once
covered
with
fine
wood
but
it
was
all
cut
down
two
years
ago
could
have
been
so
cruel
said
her
ladyship
forget
the
present
proprietor
name
said
the
count
he
is
one
of
those
who
according
to
the
clause
of
distress
in
their
leases
lead
drive
and
carry
away
but
never
enter
their
lands
one
of
those
enemies
to
ireland
these
cruel
absentees
lady
dashfort
looked
through
her
glass
at
the
mountain
lord
colambre
sighed
and
endeavouring
to
pass
it
off
with
a
smile
said
frankly
to
the
count
are
not
aware
i
am
sure
count
that
you
are
speaking
to
the
son
of
an
irish
absentee
nay
do
not
be
shocked
my
dear
sir
i
tell
you
only
because
i
thought
it
fair
to
do
so
but
let
me
assure
you
that
nothing
you
could
say
on
that
subject
could
hurt
me
personally
because
i
feel
that
i
am
not
that
i
never
can
be
an
enemy
to
ireland
an
absentee
voluntarily
i
never
yet
have
been
and
as
to
the
future
i
declare
declare
you
know
nothing
of
the
future
interrupted
lady
dashfort
in
a
tone
know
nothing
make
no
rash
vows
and
you
will
break
none
the
undaunted
assurance
of
lady
dashfort
genius
for
intrigue
gave
her
an
air
of
frank
imprudence
which
prevented
lord
colambre
from
suspecting
that
more
was
meant
than
met
the
ear
the
count
and
he
took
leave
of
one
another
with
mutual
regard
and
lady
dashfort
rejoiced
to
have
got
our
hero
out
of
halloran
castle
chapter
ix
lord
colambre
had
waited
with
great
impatience
for
an
answer
to
the
letter
of
inquiry
which
he
had
written
about
miss
nugent
mother
a
letter
from
lady
clonbrony
arrived
he
opened
it
with
the
greatest
eagerness
passed
over
warm
weather
warm
bath
buxton
balls
miss
broadhurst
your
friend
sir
arthur
berryl
very
assiduous
the
name
of
grace
nugent
he
found
at
last
and
read
as
follows
her
mother
maiden
name
was
omar
and
there
was
a
faux
pas
certainly
she
was
i
am
told
for
it
was
before
my
time
educated
at
a
convent
abroad
and
there
was
an
affair
with
a
captain
reynolds
a
young
officer
which
her
friends
were
obliged
to
hush
up
she
brought
an
infant
to
england
with
her
and
took
the
name
of
reynolds
but
none
of
that
family
would
acknowledge
her
and
she
lived
in
great
obscurity
till
your
uncle
nugent
saw
fell
in
love
with
her
and
knowing
her
whole
history
married
her
he
adopted
the
child
gave
her
his
name
and
after
some
years
the
whole
story
was
forgotten
nothing
could
be
more
disadvantageous
to
grace
than
to
have
it
revived
this
is
the
reason
we
kept
it
secret
lord
colambre
tore
the
letter
to
bits
from
the
perturbation
which
lady
dashfort
saw
in
his
countenance
she
guessed
the
nature
of
the
letter
which
he
had
been
reading
and
for
the
arrival
of
which
he
had
been
so
impatient
has
worked
said
she
to
herself
le
coup
philippe
je
te
tiens
lord
colambre
appeared
this
day
more
sensible
than
he
had
ever
yet
seemed
to
the
charms
of
the
fair
isabel
a
and
many
a
heart
is
caught
at
the
rebound
said
lady
dashfort
now
is
your
time
and
so
it
was
or
so
perhaps
it
would
have
been
but
for
a
circumstance
which
her
ladyship
with
all
her
genius
for
intrigue
had
never
taken
into
her
consideration
count
came
to
return
the
visit
which
had
been
paid
to
him
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
spoke
of
the
officers
who
had
been
introduced
to
him
and
told
lady
dashfort
that
he
had
heard
a
report
which
shocked
him
much
he
hoped
it
could
not
be
true
that
one
of
these
officers
had
introduced
his
mistress
as
his
wife
to
lady
oranmore
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
this
officer
it
was
said
had
let
lady
oranmore
send
her
carriage
for
this
woman
and
that
she
had
dined
at
oranmore
with
her
ladyship
and
her
daughters
fact
i
can
not
believe
it
i
can
not
believe
it
to
be
possible
that
any
gentleman
that
any
officer
could
do
such
a
thing
said
the
count
is
this
all
exclaimed
lady
dashfort
this
all
the
terrible
affair
my
good
count
which
has
brought
your
face
to
this
prodigious
length
the
count
looked
at
lady
dashfort
with
astonishment
a
look
of
virtuous
indignation
continued
she
i
never
behold
on
or
off
the
stage
forgive
me
for
laughing
count
but
believe
me
comedy
goes
through
the
world
better
than
tragedy
and
take
it
all
in
all
does
rather
less
mischief
as
to
the
thing
in
question
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
dare
say
it
is
not
true
but
now
suppose
it
was
it
is
only
a
silly
quiz
of
a
raw
young
officer
upon
a
prudish
old
dowager
i
know
nothing
about
it
for
my
part
but
after
all
what
irreparable
mischief
has
been
done
laugh
at
the
thing
and
then
it
is
a
jest
a
bad
one
perhaps
but
still
only
a
jest
and
there
an
end
of
it
but
take
it
seriously
and
there
is
no
knowing
where
it
might
end
in
half
a
dozen
duels
maybe
that
madam
said
the
count
oranmore
prudence
and
presence
of
mind
have
prevented
all
danger
her
ladyship
would
not
understand
the
insult
she
said
or
she
acted
as
if
she
said
je
ne
veux
rien
voir
rien
ecouter
rien
savoir
lady
oranmore
is
one
of
the
most
respectable
i
beg
your
pardon
interrupted
lady
dashfort
i
must
tell
you
that
your
favourite
lady
oranmore
has
behaved
very
ill
to
me
purposely
omitted
to
invite
isabel
to
her
ball
offended
and
insulted
me
her
praises
therefore
can
not
be
the
most
agreeable
subject
of
conversation
you
can
choose
for
my
amusement
and
as
to
the
rest
you
who
have
such
variety
and
so
much
politeness
will
i
am
sure
have
the
goodness
to
indulge
my
caprice
in
this
instance
i
shall
obey
your
ladyship
and
be
silent
whatever
pleasure
it
might
give
me
to
speak
on
that
subject
said
the
count
i
trust
lady
dashfort
will
reward
me
by
the
assurance
that
however
playfully
she
may
have
just
now
spoken
she
seriously
disapproves
and
is
shocked
shocked
shocked
to
death
if
that
will
satisfy
you
my
dear
count
the
count
obviously
was
not
satisfied
he
had
civil
as
well
as
military
courage
and
his
sense
of
right
and
wrong
could
stand
against
the
raillery
and
ridicule
of
a
fine
lady
the
conversation
ended
lady
dashfort
thought
it
would
have
no
further
consequences
and
she
did
not
regret
the
loss
of
a
man
like
count
who
lived
retired
in
his
castle
and
who
could
not
have
any
influence
upon
the
opinion
of
the
fashionable
world
however
upon
turning
from
the
count
to
lord
colambre
who
she
thought
had
been
occupied
with
lady
isabel
and
to
whom
she
imagined
all
this
dispute
was
uninteresting
she
perceived
by
his
countenance
that
she
had
made
a
great
mistake
still
she
trusted
that
her
power
over
lord
colambre
was
sufficient
easily
to
efface
whatever
unfavourable
impression
this
conversation
had
made
upon
his
mind
he
had
no
personal
interest
in
the
affair
and
she
had
generally
found
that
people
are
easily
satisfied
about
any
wrong
or
insult
public
or
private
in
which
they
have
no
immediate
concern
but
all
the
charms
of
her
conversation
were
now
tried
in
vain
to
reclaim
him
from
the
reverie
into
which
he
had
fallen
his
friend
sir
james
brooke
parting
advice
occurred
to
our
hero
his
eyes
began
to
open
to
lady
dashfort
character
and
he
was
from
this
moment
freed
from
her
power
lady
isabel
however
had
taken
no
part
in
all
this
she
was
blameless
and
independently
of
her
mother
and
in
pretended
opposition
of
sentiment
she
might
have
continued
to
retain
the
influence
she
had
gained
over
lord
colambre
but
that
a
slight
accident
revealed
to
him
her
real
disposition
it
happened
on
the
evening
of
this
day
that
lady
isabel
came
into
the
library
with
one
of
the
young
ladies
of
the
house
talking
very
eagerly
without
perceiving
lord
colambre
who
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
recesses
reading
dear
creature
you
are
quite
mistaken
said
lady
isabel
was
never
a
favourite
of
mine
i
always
detested
him
i
only
flirted
with
him
to
plague
his
wife
oh
that
wife
my
dear
elizabeth
i
do
hate
cried
she
clasping
her
hands
and
expressing
hatred
with
all
her
soul
and
with
all
her
strength
detest
that
lady
de
cresey
to
such
a
degree
that
to
purchase
the
pleasure
of
making
her
feel
the
pangs
of
jealousy
for
one
hour
look
i
would
this
moment
lay
down
this
finger
and
let
it
be
cut
off
the
face
the
whole
figure
of
lady
isabel
at
this
moment
appeared
to
lord
colambre
suddenly
metamorphosed
instead
of
the
soft
gentle
amiable
female
all
sweet
charity
and
tender
sympathy
formed
to
love
and
to
be
loved
he
beheld
one
possessed
and
convulsed
by
an
evil
spirit
her
beauty
if
beauty
it
could
be
called
the
beauty
of
a
fiend
some
ejaculation
which
he
unconsciously
uttered
made
lady
isabel
start
she
saw
him
saw
the
expression
of
his
countenance
and
knew
that
all
was
over
lord
colambre
to
the
utter
astonishment
and
disappointment
of
lady
dashfort
and
to
the
still
greater
mortification
of
lady
isabel
announced
this
night
that
it
was
necessary
he
should
immediately
pursue
his
tour
in
ireland
we
pass
over
all
the
castles
in
the
air
which
the
young
ladies
of
the
family
had
built
and
which
now
fell
to
the
ground
we
pass
all
the
civil
speeches
of
lord
and
lady
killpatrick
all
the
vehement
remonstrances
of
lady
dashfort
and
the
vain
sighs
of
lady
isabel
to
the
last
moment
lady
dashfort
said
will
not
go
but
he
went
and
when
he
was
gone
lady
dashfort
exclaimed
man
has
escaped
from
me
and
after
a
pause
turning
to
her
daughter
she
in
the
most
taunting
and
contemptuous
terms
reproached
her
as
the
cause
of
this
failure
concluding
by
a
declaration
that
she
must
in
future
manage
her
own
affairs
and
had
best
settle
her
mind
to
marry
heathcock
since
every
one
else
was
too
wise
to
think
of
her
lady
isabel
of
course
retorted
but
we
leave
this
amiable
mother
and
daughter
to
recriminate
in
appropriate
terms
and
we
follow
our
hero
rejoiced
that
he
has
been
disentangled
from
their
snares
those
who
have
never
been
in
similar
peril
will
wonder
much
that
he
did
not
escape
sooner
those
who
have
ever
been
in
like
danger
will
wonder
more
that
he
escaped
at
all
those
who
are
best
acquainted
with
the
heart
or
imagination
of
man
will
be
most
ready
to
acknowledge
that
the
combined
charms
of
wit
beauty
and
flattery
may
for
a
time
suspend
the
action
of
right
reason
in
the
mind
of
the
greatest
philosopher
or
operate
against
the
resolutions
of
the
greatest
of
heroes
lord
colambre
pursued
his
way
to
castle
halloran
desirous
before
he
quitted
this
part
of
the
country
to
take
leave
of
the
count
who
had
shown
him
much
civility
and
for
whose
honourable
conduct
and
generous
character
he
had
conceived
a
high
esteem
which
no
little
peculiarities
of
antiquated
dress
or
manner
could
diminish
indeed
the
politeness
of
what
was
formerly
called
a
gentleman
pleased
him
better
than
the
indolent
or
insolent
selfishness
of
modern
men
of
the
ton
perhaps
notwithstanding
our
hero
determination
to
turn
his
mind
from
everything
connected
with
the
idea
of
miss
nugent
some
latent
curiosity
about
the
of
the
nugents
might
have
operated
to
make
him
call
upon
the
count
in
this
hope
he
was
disappointed
for
a
cross
miller
to
whom
the
was
set
on
which
the
was
found
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
refuse
admittance
and
none
could
enter
his
ground
count
was
much
pleased
by
lord
colambre
visit
the
very
day
of
lord
colambre
arrival
at
halloran
castle
the
count
was
going
to
oranmore
he
was
dressed
and
his
carriage
was
waiting
therefore
lord
colambre
begged
that
he
might
not
detain
him
and
the
count
requested
his
lordship
to
accompany
him
me
have
the
honour
of
introducing
you
my
lord
to
a
family
with
whom
i
am
persuaded
you
will
be
pleased
by
whom
you
will
be
appreciated
and
at
whose
house
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
best
manner
of
living
of
the
irish
nobility
lord
colambre
accepted
the
invitation
and
was
introduced
at
oranmore
the
dignified
appearance
and
respectable
character
of
lady
oranmore
the
charming
unaffected
manners
of
her
daughters
the
air
of
domestic
happiness
and
comfort
in
her
family
the
becoming
magnificence
free
from
ostentation
in
her
whole
establishment
the
respect
and
affection
with
which
she
was
treated
by
all
who
approached
her
delighted
and
touched
lord
colambre
the
more
perhaps
because
he
had
heard
this
family
so
unjustly
abused
and
because
he
saw
lady
oranmore
and
her
daughter
in
immediate
contrast
to
lady
dashfort
and
lady
isabel
a
little
circumstance
which
occurred
during
this
visit
increased
his
interest
for
the
family
when
lady
de
cresey
little
boys
came
in
after
dinner
one
of
them
was
playing
with
a
seal
which
had
just
been
torn
from
a
letter
the
child
showed
it
to
lord
colambre
and
asked
him
to
read
the
motto
the
motto
was
not
words
his
friend
sir
james
brooke
motto
and
his
arms
lord
colambre
eagerly
inquired
if
this
family
was
acquainted
with
sir
james
and
he
soon
perceived
that
they
were
not
only
acquainted
with
him
but
that
they
were
particularly
interested
about
him
lady
oranmore
second
daughter
lady
harriet
appeared
particularly
pleased
by
the
manner
in
which
lord
colambre
spoke
of
sir
james
and
the
child
who
had
now
established
himself
on
his
lordship
knee
turned
round
and
whispered
in
his
ear
aunt
harriet
gave
me
the
seal
sir
james
is
to
be
married
to
aunt
harriet
and
then
he
will
be
my
uncle
some
of
the
principal
gentry
of
this
part
of
the
country
happened
to
dine
at
oranmore
one
of
the
days
lord
colambre
was
there
he
was
surprised
at
the
discovery
that
there
were
so
many
agreeable
and
people
of
whom
while
he
was
at
killpatrickstown
he
had
seen
nothing
he
now
discerned
how
far
he
had
been
deceived
by
lady
dashfort
both
the
count
and
lord
and
lady
oranmore
who
were
warmly
attached
to
their
country
exhorted
him
to
make
himself
amends
for
the
time
he
had
lost
by
seeing
with
his
own
eyes
and
judging
with
his
own
understanding
of
the
country
and
its
own
inhabitants
during
the
remainder
of
the
time
he
was
to
stay
in
ireland
the
higher
classes
in
most
countries
they
observed
were
generally
similar
but
in
the
lower
class
he
would
find
many
characteristic
differences
when
he
first
came
to
ireland
he
had
been
very
eager
to
go
and
see
his
father
estate
and
to
judge
of
the
conduct
of
his
agents
and
the
condition
of
his
tenantry
but
this
eagerness
had
subsided
and
the
design
had
almost
faded
from
his
mind
whilst
under
the
influence
of
lady
dashfort
misrepresentations
a
mistake
relative
to
some
remittance
from
his
banker
in
dublin
obliged
him
to
delay
his
journey
a
few
days
and
during
that
time
lord
and
lady
oranmore
showed
him
the
neat
cottages
the
schools
in
their
neighbourhood
they
showed
him
not
only
what
could
be
done
but
what
had
been
done
by
the
influence
of
great
proprietors
residing
on
their
own
estates
and
encouraging
the
people
by
judicious
kindness
he
saw
he
acknowledged
the
truth
of
this
but
it
did
not
come
home
to
his
feelings
now
as
it
would
have
done
a
little
while
ago
his
views
and
plans
were
altered
he
looked
forward
to
the
idea
of
marrying
and
settling
in
ireland
and
then
everything
in
the
country
was
interesting
to
him
but
since
he
had
forbidden
himself
to
think
of
a
union
with
miss
nugent
his
mind
had
lost
its
object
and
its
spring
he
was
not
sufficiently
calm
to
think
of
the
public
good
his
thoughts
were
absorbed
by
his
private
concern
he
knew
and
repeated
to
himself
that
he
ought
to
visit
his
own
and
his
father
estates
and
to
see
the
condition
of
his
tenantry
he
desired
to
fulfil
his
duties
but
they
ceased
to
appear
to
him
easy
and
pleasurable
for
hope
and
love
no
longer
brightened
his
prospects
that
he
might
see
and
hear
more
than
he
could
as
to
the
estate
he
sent
his
servant
to
dublin
to
wait
for
him
there
he
travelled
incognito
wrapped
himself
in
a
shabby
greatcoat
and
took
the
name
of
evans
he
arrived
at
a
village
or
as
it
was
called
a
town
which
bore
the
name
of
colambre
he
was
agreeably
surprised
by
the
air
of
neatness
and
finish
in
the
houses
and
in
the
street
which
had
a
paved
footway
he
slept
at
a
small
but
excellent
inn
excellent
perhaps
because
it
was
small
and
proportioned
to
the
situation
and
business
of
the
place
good
supper
good
bed
good
attendance
nothing
out
of
repair
no
things
pressed
into
services
for
what
they
were
never
intended
by
nature
or
art
none
of
what
are
vulgarly
called
no
chambermaid
slipshod
or
waiter
smelling
of
whisky
but
all
tight
and
right
and
everybody
doing
their
own
business
and
doing
it
as
if
it
was
their
everyday
occupation
not
as
if
it
was
done
by
particular
desire
for
first
or
last
time
this
season
the
landlord
came
in
at
supper
to
inquire
whether
anything
was
wanted
lord
colambre
took
this
opportunity
of
entering
into
conversation
with
him
and
asked
him
to
whom
the
town
belonged
and
who
were
the
proprietors
of
the
neighbouring
estates
town
belongs
to
an
absentee
lord
one
lord
clonbrony
who
lives
always
beyond
the
seas
in
london
and
never
seen
the
town
since
it
was
a
town
to
call
a
town
does
the
land
in
the
neighbourhood
belong
to
this
lord
clonbrony
does
sir
he
a
great
proprietor
but
knows
nothing
of
his
property
nor
of
us
never
set
foot
among
us
to
my
knowledge
since
i
was
as
high
as
the
table
he
might
as
well
be
a
west
india
planter
and
we
negroes
for
anything
he
knows
to
the
contrary
has
no
more
care
nor
thought
about
us
than
if
he
were
in
jamaica
or
the
other
world
shame
for
him
but
there
too
many
to
keep
him
in
countenance
lord
colambre
asked
him
what
wine
he
could
have
and
then
inquired
who
managed
the
estate
for
this
absentee
burke
sir
and
i
do
know
why
god
was
so
kind
to
give
so
good
an
agent
to
an
absentee
like
lord
clonbrony
except
it
was
for
the
sake
of
us
who
is
under
him
and
knows
the
blessing
and
is
thankful
for
the
same
good
cutlets
said
lord
colambre
am
happy
to
hear
it
sir
they
have
a
right
to
be
good
for
burke
sent
her
own
cook
to
teach
my
wife
to
dress
cutlets
the
agent
is
a
good
agent
is
he
is
thanks
be
to
heaven
and
that
what
few
can
boast
especially
when
the
landlord
living
over
the
seas
we
have
the
luck
to
have
got
a
good
agent
over
us
in
burke
who
is
a
right
bred
gentleman
a
snug
little
property
of
his
own
honestly
made
with
the
good
will
and
good
wishes
and
respect
of
all
he
live
in
the
neighbourhood
convanient
convenient
near
at
the
end
of
the
town
in
the
house
on
the
hill
as
you
passed
sir
to
the
left
with
the
trees
about
it
all
of
his
planting
finely
grown
too
for
there
a
blessing
on
all
he
does
and
he
has
done
a
there
salad
sir
if
you
are
partial
to
it
very
fine
lettuce
burke
sent
us
the
plants
herself
salad
so
this
burke
has
done
a
great
deal
has
he
in
what
way
every
way
sir
sure
was
not
it
he
that
had
improved
and
fostered
and
made
the
town
of
colambre
no
thanks
to
the
proprietor
nor
to
the
young
man
whose
name
it
bears
neither
you
any
porter
pray
sir
have
sir
as
good
i
hope
as
you
drink
in
london
for
it
the
same
you
get
there
i
understand
from
cork
and
i
have
some
of
my
own
brewing
which
they
say
you
could
not
tell
the
difference
between
it
and
cork
quality
if
you
be
pleased
to
try
harry
the
corkscrew
the
porter
of
his
own
brewing
was
pronounced
to
be
extremely
good
and
the
landlord
observed
it
was
burke
encouraged
him
to
learn
to
brew
and
lent
him
his
own
brewer
for
a
time
to
teach
him
burke
i
find
is
apropos
to
porter
apropos
to
salad
apropos
to
cutlets
apropos
to
everything
said
lord
colambre
smiling
seems
to
be
a
of
an
agent
i
suppose
you
are
a
great
favourite
of
his
and
you
do
what
you
please
with
him
no
sir
i
could
not
say
that
burke
does
not
have
favourites
anyway
but
according
to
my
deserts
i
trust
i
stand
well
enough
with
him
for
in
truth
he
is
a
right
good
agent
lord
colambre
still
pressed
for
particulars
he
was
an
englishman
and
a
stranger
he
said
and
did
not
exactly
know
what
was
meant
in
ireland
by
a
good
agent
he
is
the
man
that
will
encourage
the
improving
tenant
and
show
no
favour
or
affection
but
justice
which
comes
even
to
all
and
does
best
for
all
at
the
long
run
and
residing
always
in
the
country
like
burke
and
understanding
country
business
and
going
about
continually
among
the
tenantry
he
knows
when
to
press
for
the
rent
and
when
to
leave
the
money
to
lay
out
upon
the
land
and
according
as
they
would
want
it
can
give
a
tenant
a
help
or
a
check
properly
then
no
called
for
no
presents
nor
nor
even
taken
or
offered
no
underhand
hints
about
proposals
when
land
would
be
out
of
lease
but
a
considerable
preference
if
desarved
to
the
old
tenant
and
if
not
a
fair
advertisement
and
the
best
offer
and
tenant
accepted
no
screwing
of
the
land
to
the
highest
penny
just
to
please
the
head
landlord
for
the
minute
and
ruin
him
at
the
end
by
the
tenant
racking
the
land
and
running
off
with
the
year
rent
nor
no
bargains
to
his
own
relations
or
friends
did
burke
ever
give
or
grant
but
all
fair
between
landlord
and
tenant
and
that
the
thing
that
will
last
and
that
what
i
call
the
good
agent
lord
colambre
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
and
begged
the
innkeeper
to
drink
the
good
agent
health
in
which
he
was
heartily
pledged
thank
your
honour
burke
health
and
long
may
he
live
over
and
amongst
us
he
saved
me
from
drink
and
ruin
when
i
was
once
inclined
to
it
and
made
a
man
of
me
and
all
my
family
the
particulars
we
can
not
stay
to
detail
this
grateful
man
however
took
pleasure
in
sounding
the
praises
of
his
benefactor
and
in
raising
him
in
the
opinion
of
the
traveller
you
time
and
are
curious
about
such
things
sir
perhaps
you
walk
up
to
the
school
that
burke
has
for
the
poor
children
and
look
at
the
and
see
how
clean
he
takes
a
pride
to
keep
the
town
and
any
house
in
the
town
from
the
priest
to
the
parson
that
you
go
into
will
give
you
the
same
character
as
i
do
of
burke
from
the
brogue
to
the
boot
all
speak
the
same
of
him
and
can
say
no
other
god
for
ever
bless
and
keep
him
over
us
upon
making
further
inquiries
everything
the
innkeeper
had
said
was
confirmed
by
different
inhabitants
of
the
village
lord
colambre
conversed
with
the
shopkeepers
with
the
cottagers
and
without
making
any
alarming
inquiries
he
obtained
all
the
information
he
wanted
he
went
to
the
village
school
a
pretty
cheerful
house
with
a
neat
garden
and
a
met
burke
introduced
himself
to
her
as
a
traveller
the
school
was
shown
to
him
it
was
just
what
it
ought
to
be
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
had
been
attempted
there
was
neither
too
much
interference
nor
too
little
attention
nothing
for
exhibition
care
to
teach
well
without
any
vain
attempt
to
teach
in
a
wonderfully
short
time
all
that
experience
proves
to
be
useful
in
both
bell
and
lancaster
modes
of
teaching
burke
had
adopted
leaving
it
to
zealots
to
fight
about
the
rest
that
no
attempts
at
proselytism
had
been
made
and
that
no
illiberal
distinctions
had
been
made
in
this
school
lord
colambre
was
convinced
in
the
best
manner
possible
by
seeing
the
children
of
protestants
and
catholics
sitting
on
the
same
benches
learning
from
the
same
books
and
speaking
to
one
another
with
the
same
cordial
familiarity
burke
was
an
unaffected
sensible
woman
free
from
all
party
prejudices
and
without
ostentation
desirous
and
capable
of
doing
good
lord
colambre
was
much
pleased
with
her
and
very
glad
that
she
invited
him
to
dinner
burke
did
not
come
in
till
late
for
he
had
been
detained
portioning
out
some
meadows
which
were
of
great
consequence
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
he
brought
home
to
dine
with
him
the
clergyman
and
the
priest
of
the
parish
both
of
whom
he
had
taken
successful
pains
to
accommodate
with
the
land
which
suited
their
respective
convenience
the
good
terms
on
which
they
seemed
to
be
with
each
other
and
with
him
appeared
to
lord
colambre
to
do
honour
to
burke
all
the
favourable
accounts
his
lordship
had
received
of
this
gentleman
were
confirmed
by
what
he
saw
and
heard
after
the
clergyman
and
priest
had
taken
leave
upon
lord
colambre
expressing
some
surprise
mixed
with
satisfaction
at
seeing
the
harmony
which
subsisted
between
them
burke
assured
him
that
this
was
the
same
in
many
parts
of
ireland
he
observed
that
the
suspicion
of
never
fails
to
produce
it
so
he
had
often
found
that
taking
it
for
granted
that
no
exists
has
the
most
conciliating
effect
he
said
to
please
opposite
parties
he
used
no
arts
but
he
tried
to
make
all
his
neighbours
live
comfortably
together
by
making
them
acquainted
with
each
other
good
qualities
by
giving
them
opportunities
of
meeting
sociably
and
from
time
to
time
of
doing
each
other
little
services
and
good
offices
he
had
so
much
to
do
he
said
he
had
no
time
for
controversy
he
was
a
plain
man
made
it
a
rule
not
to
meddle
with
speculative
points
and
to
avoid
all
irritating
discussions
he
was
not
to
rule
the
country
but
to
live
in
it
and
make
others
live
as
happily
as
he
could
having
nothing
to
conceal
in
his
character
opinions
or
circumstances
burke
was
perfectly
open
and
unreserved
in
his
manner
and
conversation
freely
answered
all
the
traveller
inquiries
and
took
pains
to
show
him
everything
he
desired
to
see
lord
colambre
said
he
had
thoughts
of
settling
in
ireland
and
declared
with
truth
that
he
had
not
seen
any
part
of
the
country
he
should
like
better
to
live
in
than
this
neighbourhood
he
went
over
most
of
the
estate
with
burke
and
had
ample
opportunities
of
convincing
himself
that
this
gentleman
was
indeed
as
the
innkeeper
had
described
him
right
good
gentleman
and
a
right
good
agent
he
paid
burke
some
just
compliments
on
the
state
of
the
tenantry
and
the
neat
and
flourishing
appearance
of
the
town
of
colambre
pleasure
it
will
give
the
proprietor
when
he
sees
all
you
have
done
said
lord
colambre
sir
do
speak
of
it
that
breaks
my
heart
he
never
has
shown
the
least
interest
in
anything
i
have
done
he
is
quite
dissatisfied
with
me
because
i
have
not
ruined
his
tenantry
by
forcing
them
to
pay
more
than
the
land
is
worth
because
i
have
not
squeezed
money
from
them
by
fining
down
rents
and
but
all
this
as
an
englishman
sir
must
be
unintelligible
to
you
the
end
of
the
matter
is
that
attached
as
i
am
to
this
place
and
the
people
about
me
and
as
i
hope
the
tenantry
are
to
me
i
fear
i
shall
be
obliged
to
give
up
the
agency
up
the
agency
how
so
you
must
not
cried
lord
colambre
and
for
the
moment
he
forgot
himself
but
burke
took
this
only
for
an
expression
of
must
i
am
afraid
continued
he
employer
lord
clonbrony
is
displeased
with
me
continual
calls
for
money
come
upon
me
from
england
and
complaints
of
my
slow
remittances
lord
clonbrony
is
in
embarrassed
circumstances
said
lord
colambre
never
speak
of
my
employer
affairs
sir
replied
burke
now
for
the
first
time
assuming
an
air
of
reserve
beg
pardon
sir
i
seem
to
have
asked
an
indiscreet
question
burke
was
silent
my
reserve
should
give
you
a
false
impression
i
will
add
sir
resumed
burke
i
really
am
not
acquainted
with
the
state
of
his
lordship
affairs
in
general
i
know
only
what
belongs
to
the
estate
under
my
own
management
the
principal
part
of
his
lordship
property
the
clonbrony
estate
is
under
another
agent
mr
garraghty
repeated
lord
colambre
sort
of
a
person
is
he
but
i
may
take
it
for
granted
that
it
can
not
fall
to
the
lot
of
one
and
the
same
absentee
to
have
two
such
agents
as
mr
burke
burke
bowed
and
seemed
pleased
by
the
compliment
which
he
knew
he
deserved
but
not
a
word
did
he
say
of
garraghty
and
lord
colambre
afraid
of
betraying
himself
by
some
other
indiscreet
question
changed
the
conversation
that
very
night
the
post
brought
a
letter
to
burke
from
lord
clonbrony
which
burke
gave
to
his
wife
as
soon
as
he
had
read
it
saying
the
reward
of
all
my
services
burke
glanced
her
eye
over
the
letter
and
being
extremely
fond
of
her
husband
and
sensible
of
his
deserving
far
different
treatment
burst
into
indignant
exclamations
the
reward
of
all
your
services
indeed
what
an
unreasonable
ungrateful
man
so
this
is
the
thanks
for
all
you
have
done
for
lord
clonbrony
does
not
know
what
i
have
done
my
dear
he
never
has
seen
what
i
have
done
shame
for
him
never
i
suppose
looks
over
his
accounts
or
understands
them
shame
for
him
he
listens
to
foolish
reports
or
misrepresentations
perhaps
he
is
at
a
distance
and
can
not
find
out
the
truth
shame
for
him
it
quietly
my
dear
we
have
the
comfort
of
a
good
conscience
the
agency
may
be
taken
from
me
by
this
lord
but
the
sense
of
having
done
my
duty
no
lord
or
man
upon
earth
can
give
or
take
away
a
letter
said
burke
taking
it
up
again
even
the
civility
to
write
with
his
own
hand
only
his
signature
to
the
scrawl
looks
as
if
it
was
written
by
a
drunken
man
does
not
it
mr
evans
said
she
showing
the
letter
to
lord
colambre
who
immediately
recognised
the
writing
of
sir
terence
does
not
look
like
the
hand
of
a
gentleman
indeed
said
lord
colambre
has
lord
clonbrony
own
signature
let
it
be
what
it
will
said
burke
looking
closely
at
it
clonbrony
own
writing
the
signature
is
i
am
clear
of
that
lord
clonbrony
son
was
clear
of
it
also
but
he
took
care
not
to
give
any
opinion
on
that
point
pray
read
it
sir
read
it
said
burke
pleased
by
his
tone
of
indignation
it
pray
a
gentleman
may
write
a
bad
hand
but
no
gentleman
could
write
such
a
letter
as
that
to
burke
pray
read
it
sir
you
who
have
seen
something
of
what
burke
has
done
for
the
town
of
colambre
and
what
he
has
made
of
the
tenantry
and
the
estate
of
lord
clonbrony
lord
colambre
read
and
was
convinced
that
his
father
had
never
written
or
read
the
letter
but
had
signed
it
trusting
to
sir
terence
having
expressed
his
sentiments
properly
sir
as
i
have
no
further
occasion
for
your
services
you
will
take
notice
that
i
hereby
request
you
will
forthwith
hand
over
on
or
before
the
of
november
next
your
accounts
with
the
balance
due
of
the
which
i
understand
is
more
than
ought
to
be
at
this
season
to
nicholas
college
green
dublin
who
in
future
will
act
as
agent
and
shall
get
by
post
immediately
a
power
of
attorney
for
the
same
entitling
him
to
receive
and
manage
the
colambre
as
well
as
the
clonbrony
estate
for
sir
your
obedient
humble
servant
clonbrony
square
though
misrepresentation
caprice
or
interest
might
have
induced
lord
clonbrony
to
desire
to
change
his
agent
yet
lord
colambre
knew
that
his
father
never
could
have
announced
his
wishes
in
such
a
style
and
as
he
returned
the
letter
to
burke
he
repeated
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
that
any
nobleman
could
have
written
such
a
letter
that
it
must
have
been
written
by
some
inferior
person
and
that
his
lordship
had
signed
it
without
reading
it
dear
i
sorry
you
showed
that
letter
to
evans
said
burke
do
like
to
expose
lord
clonbrony
he
is
a
gentleman
misled
by
ignorant
or
designing
people
at
all
events
it
is
not
for
us
to
expose
him
has
exposed
himself
said
burke
the
world
should
know
it
was
very
kind
to
me
when
i
was
a
young
man
said
burke
must
not
forget
that
now
because
we
are
angry
my
love
no
my
love
to
be
sure
we
should
not
but
who
could
have
recollected
it
just
at
this
minute
but
yourself
and
now
sir
turning
to
lord
colambre
see
what
kind
of
a
man
this
is
now
is
it
not
difficult
for
me
to
bear
patiently
to
see
him
only
difficult
but
impossible
i
should
think
madam
said
lord
colambre
know
even
i
who
am
a
stranger
can
not
help
feeling
for
both
of
you
as
you
must
see
i
do
half
the
world
who
do
know
him
continued
burke
they
hear
that
lord
clonbrony
agency
is
taken
from
him
will
think
perhaps
that
he
is
to
blame
madam
said
lord
colambre
you
need
not
fear
burke
may
safely
trust
to
his
character
from
what
i
have
within
these
two
days
seen
and
heard
i
am
convinced
that
such
is
the
respect
he
has
deserved
and
acquired
that
no
blame
can
touch
him
i
thank
you
said
burke
the
tears
coming
into
her
eyes
can
judge
you
do
him
justice
but
there
are
so
many
who
do
know
him
and
who
will
decide
without
knowing
any
of
the
facts
my
dear
happens
about
everything
to
everybody
said
burke
we
must
have
patience
time
sets
all
judgments
right
sooner
or
later
the
sooner
the
better
said
burke
evans
i
hope
you
will
be
so
kind
if
ever
you
hear
this
business
talked
of
evans
lives
in
wales
my
dear
but
he
is
travelling
through
ireland
my
dear
and
he
said
he
should
return
to
dublin
and
you
know
there
he
certainly
will
hear
it
talked
of
and
i
hope
he
will
do
me
the
favour
to
state
what
he
has
seen
and
knows
to
be
the
truth
assured
that
i
will
do
burke
justice
as
far
as
it
is
in
my
power
said
lord
colambre
restraining
himself
much
that
he
might
not
say
more
than
became
his
assumed
character
he
took
leave
of
this
worthy
family
that
night
and
early
the
next
morning
departed
thought
he
as
he
drove
away
from
this
and
flourishing
place
happy
i
might
be
settled
here
with
such
a
wife
as
her
of
whom
i
must
think
no
more
he
pursued
his
way
to
clonbrony
his
father
other
estate
which
was
at
a
considerable
distance
from
colambre
he
was
resolved
to
know
what
kind
of
agent
nicholas
garraghty
might
be
who
was
to
supersede
burke
and
by
power
of
attorney
to
be
immediately
entitled
to
receive
and
manage
the
colambre
as
well
as
the
clonbrony
estate
chapter
x
towards
the
evening
of
the
second
day
journey
the
driver
of
lord
colambre
hackney
chaise
stopped
and
jumping
off
the
wooden
bar
on
which
he
had
been
seated
exclaimed
come
to
the
bad
step
now
the
bad
road
beginning
upon
us
please
your
honour
road
that
is
very
uncommon
in
this
country
i
never
saw
such
fine
roads
as
you
have
in
ireland
true
and
god
bless
your
honour
that
sensible
of
that
same
for
it
not
what
all
the
foreign
quality
i
drive
have
the
manners
to
notice
god
bless
your
honour
i
heard
you
a
welshman
but
whether
or
no
i
am
sure
you
are
a
gentleman
anyway
welsh
or
other
notwithstanding
the
shabby
greatcoat
the
shrewd
postillion
perceived
by
our
hero
language
that
he
was
a
gentleman
after
much
dragging
at
the
horses
heads
and
pushing
and
lifting
the
carriage
was
got
over
what
the
postillion
said
was
the
worst
part
of
the
bad
step
but
as
the
road
not
yet
to
say
good
he
continued
walking
beside
the
carriage
only
bad
just
hereabouts
and
that
by
accident
said
he
account
of
there
being
no
jantleman
resident
in
it
nor
near
but
only
a
bit
of
an
a
great
little
rogue
who
gets
his
own
turn
out
of
the
roads
and
of
everything
else
in
life
i
larry
brady
that
am
telling
your
honour
have
a
good
right
to
know
for
myself
and
my
father
and
my
brother
pat
brady
the
wheelwright
had
once
a
farm
under
him
but
was
ruined
horse
and
foot
all
along
with
him
and
cast
out
and
my
brother
forced
to
fly
the
country
and
is
now
working
in
some
coachmaker
yard
in
london
banished
he
is
and
here
am
i
forced
to
be
what
i
am
and
now
that
i
reduced
to
drive
a
hack
the
agent
a
curse
to
me
still
with
these
bad
roads
killing
my
horses
and
wheels
and
a
shame
to
the
country
which
i
think
more
of
bad
luck
to
him
know
your
brother
he
lives
with
mordicai
in
long
acre
in
london
god
bless
you
for
that
they
came
at
this
time
within
view
of
a
range
of
about
men
and
boys
sitting
astride
on
heaps
of
broken
stones
on
each
side
of
the
road
they
were
all
armed
with
hammers
with
which
they
began
to
pound
with
great
diligence
and
noise
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
carriage
the
chaise
passed
between
these
batteries
the
stones
flying
on
all
sides
are
you
jem
how
are
you
phil
said
larry
hold
your
hand
ca
ye
while
i
stop
and
get
the
stones
out
of
the
horses
feet
so
you
making
up
the
rent
are
you
for
st
dennis
said
one
of
the
pounders
coming
close
to
the
postillion
and
pointing
his
thumb
back
towards
the
chaise
have
you
in
it
you
need
not
scruple
he
a
very
honest
man
he
only
a
man
from
north
wales
one
evans
an
innocent
jantleman
that
sent
over
to
travel
up
and
down
the
country
to
find
is
there
any
copper
mines
in
it
do
you
know
larry
i
know
very
well
from
one
that
was
tould
and
i
seen
him
tax
the
man
of
the
king
head
with
a
copper
at
first
sight
which
was
only
lead
to
look
at
you
think
to
them
that
was
not
skilful
in
copper
so
lend
me
a
knife
till
i
cut
a
out
of
the
hedge
for
this
one
wo
go
far
whilst
larry
was
making
the
all
scruple
being
removed
his
question
about
dennis
and
the
rent
was
answered
it
the
rint
sure
enough
we
pounding
out
for
him
for
he
sent
the
driver
round
days
to
warn
us
old
nick
would
be
down
to
take
a
sweep
among
us
and
there
only
six
clear
days
saturday
night
before
the
assizes
sure
so
we
must
see
and
get
it
finished
anyway
to
clear
the
presentment
again
the
swearing
day
for
he
and
paddy
hart
is
the
overseers
themselves
and
paddy
is
to
swear
to
it
dennis
is
it
then
you
one
great
comfort
and
security
that
he
wo
be
particular
about
the
swearing
for
since
ever
he
had
his
head
on
his
shoulders
an
oath
never
stuck
in
dennis
throat
more
than
in
his
own
brother
old
nick
head
upon
his
shoulders
repeated
lord
colambre
did
you
ever
hear
that
dennis
head
was
off
his
shoulders
never
was
plase
your
honour
to
my
knowledge
you
never
among
your
saints
hear
of
dennis
carrying
his
head
in
his
hand
said
colambre
rael
saint
said
the
postillion
suddenly
changing
his
tone
and
looking
shocked
do
be
talking
that
way
of
the
saints
plase
your
honour
of
what
st
dennis
were
you
talking
just
now
whom
do
you
mean
by
dennis
and
whom
do
you
call
old
nick
nick
answered
the
postillion
coming
close
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
whispering
nick
plase
your
honour
is
our
nickname
for
one
nicholas
garraghty
of
college
green
dublin
and
dennis
is
his
brother
dennis
who
is
old
nick
brother
in
all
things
and
would
fain
be
a
saint
only
he
is
a
sinner
he
lives
just
by
here
in
the
country
to
lord
clonbrony
as
old
nick
is
it
only
a
joke
among
the
people
that
are
not
fond
of
them
at
all
lord
clonbrony
himself
is
a
very
good
jantleman
if
he
was
not
an
absentee
resident
in
london
leaving
us
and
everything
to
the
likes
of
them
lord
colambre
listened
with
all
possible
composure
and
attention
but
the
postillion
having
now
made
his
of
wood
and
fixed
himself
he
mounted
his
bar
and
drove
on
saying
to
lord
colambre
as
he
looked
at
the
cratures
they
could
keep
their
cattle
out
of
pound
or
themselves
out
of
jail
but
by
making
this
road
then
a
very
profitable
business
have
higher
wages
than
other
men
in
this
part
of
the
country
is
and
it
is
not
they
have
and
they
have
not
plase
your
honour
do
understand
you
becaase
you
an
englishman
that
is
a
welshman
i
beg
your
honour
pardon
but
i
tell
you
how
that
is
and
i
go
slow
over
these
broken
stones
for
i
ca
go
fast
it
is
where
there
no
jantleman
over
these
as
here
they
do
as
they
plase
and
when
they
have
set
the
land
they
get
rasonable
from
the
head
landlords
to
poor
cratures
at
a
that
they
ca
live
and
pay
the
rent
they
say
says
that
have
no
conscience
at
all
not
all
but
some
like
dennis
says
says
he
i
get
you
a
road
to
make
up
the
rent
that
is
plase
your
honour
the
agent
gets
them
a
presentment
for
so
many
perches
of
road
from
the
grand
jury
at
twice
the
price
that
would
make
the
road
and
tenants
are
by
this
means
as
they
take
the
road
by
contract
at
the
price
given
by
the
county
able
to
pay
all
they
get
by
the
job
over
and
above
potatoes
and
salt
back
again
to
the
agent
for
the
arrear
on
the
land
do
i
make
your
honour
sensible
do
i
make
you
understand
make
me
much
more
sensible
than
i
ever
was
before
said
lord
colambre
is
not
this
cheating
the
county
and
suppose
replied
larry
not
it
all
for
my
good
and
yours
too
plase
your
honour
said
larry
looking
very
shrewdly
good
said
lord
colambre
startled
have
i
to
do
with
it
you
to
do
with
the
roads
as
well
as
me
when
you
travelling
upon
them
plase
your
honour
and
sure
they
never
be
got
made
at
all
if
they
were
made
this
ways
and
it
the
best
way
in
the
wide
world
and
the
finest
roads
we
have
and
when
the
rael
jantlemen
resident
in
the
country
there
no
jobbing
can
be
because
they
then
the
leading
men
on
the
grand
jury
and
these
journeymen
jantlemen
are
then
kept
in
order
and
all
right
lord
colambre
was
much
surprised
at
larry
knowledge
of
the
manner
in
which
county
business
is
managed
as
well
as
by
his
shrewd
good
sense
he
did
not
know
that
this
is
not
uncommon
in
his
rank
of
life
in
ireland
whilst
larry
was
speaking
lord
colambre
was
looking
from
side
to
side
at
the
desolation
of
the
prospect
this
is
lord
clonbrony
estate
is
it
all
you
see
and
as
far
and
farther
than
you
can
see
my
lord
clonbrony
wrote
and
ordered
plantations
here
time
back
and
enough
was
paid
to
labourers
for
ditching
and
planting
and
what
next
why
what
did
the
do
but
let
the
goats
in
through
gaps
left
o
purpose
to
bark
the
trees
and
then
the
trees
was
all
banished
and
next
the
cattle
was
let
in
trespassing
and
winked
at
till
the
land
was
all
poached
and
then
the
land
was
waste
and
cried
down
and
dennis
wrote
up
to
dublin
to
old
nick
and
he
over
to
the
landlord
how
none
would
take
it
or
bid
anything
at
all
for
it
so
then
it
fell
to
him
a
cheap
bargain
oh
the
tricks
of
them
who
knows
if
i
do
presently
lord
colambre
attention
was
roused
again
by
seeing
a
man
running
as
if
for
his
life
across
a
bog
near
the
roadside
he
leaped
over
the
ditch
and
was
upon
the
road
in
an
instant
he
seemed
startled
at
first
at
the
sight
of
the
carriage
but
looking
at
the
postillion
larry
nodded
and
he
smiled
and
said
safe
my
good
friend
may
i
ask
what
that
is
you
have
on
your
shoulder
said
lord
colambre
plase
your
honour
it
is
only
a
private
still
which
i
just
caught
out
yonder
in
the
bog
and
i
carrying
it
in
with
all
speed
to
the
gauger
to
make
a
discovery
that
the
jantleman
may
benefit
by
the
reward
i
expect
he
make
me
a
compliment
up
behind
and
i
give
you
a
lift
said
the
postillion
you
kindly
but
better
my
legs
said
the
man
and
turning
down
a
lane
off
he
ran
again
as
fast
as
possible
he
make
me
a
compliment
repeated
lord
colambre
make
a
discovery
ay
plase
your
honour
for
the
law
is
said
larry
if
an
unlawful
still
that
is
a
still
without
license
for
whisky
is
found
half
the
benefit
of
the
fine
that
put
upon
the
parish
goes
to
him
that
made
the
discovery
that
what
that
man
is
after
for
he
an
informer
should
not
have
thought
from
what
i
see
of
you
said
lord
colambre
smiling
you
larry
would
have
offered
an
informer
a
lift
plase
your
honour
said
larry
smiling
archly
not
i
give
the
laws
a
lift
when
in
my
power
scarcely
had
he
uttered
these
words
and
scarcely
was
the
informer
out
of
sight
when
across
the
same
bog
and
over
the
ditch
came
another
man
a
half
kind
of
gentleman
with
a
red
silk
handkerchief
about
his
neck
and
a
whip
in
his
hand
you
see
any
man
pass
the
road
friend
said
he
to
the
postillion
who
would
i
see
or
why
would
i
tell
replied
larry
in
a
sulky
tone
come
be
smart
said
the
man
with
the
silver
whip
offering
to
put
half
a
crown
into
the
postillion
hand
me
which
way
he
took
have
none
a
your
silver
do
touch
me
with
it
said
larry
if
you
take
my
advice
you
strike
across
back
and
follow
the
fields
out
to
killogenesawee
the
exciseman
set
out
again
immediately
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
which
the
man
who
carried
the
still
had
taken
lord
colambre
now
perceived
that
the
pretended
informer
had
been
running
off
to
conceal
a
still
of
his
own
gauger
plase
your
honour
said
larry
looking
back
at
lord
colambre
gauger
is
a
you
put
him
on
a
wrong
scent
said
lord
colambre
i
told
him
no
lie
i
only
said
if
you
take
my
advice
and
why
was
he
such
a
fool
as
to
take
my
advice
when
i
would
take
his
fee
this
is
the
way
larry
you
give
a
lift
to
the
laws
the
laws
would
give
a
lift
to
me
plase
your
honour
maybe
i
do
as
much
by
them
but
it
only
these
revenue
laws
i
mean
for
i
never
to
my
knowledge
broke
another
commandment
but
it
what
no
honest
poor
man
among
his
neighbours
would
scruple
to
take
a
glass
of
potsheen
glass
of
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
said
lord
colambre
potsheen
plase
your
honour
becaase
it
the
little
whisky
that
made
in
the
private
still
or
pot
and
sheen
becaase
it
a
fond
word
for
whatsoever
we
like
and
for
what
we
have
little
of
and
would
make
much
of
after
taking
the
glass
of
it
no
man
could
go
and
inform
to
ruin
the
cratures
for
they
all
shelter
on
that
estate
under
favour
of
them
that
go
shares
and
make
rent
of
but
i
never
inform
again
and
after
all
if
the
truth
was
known
and
my
lord
clonbrony
should
be
informed
against
and
presented
for
it
his
neglect
is
the
bottom
of
the
nuisance
find
all
the
blame
is
thrown
upon
this
poor
lord
clonbrony
said
lord
colambre
he
is
absent
said
larry
would
not
be
so
was
he
prisint
but
your
honour
was
talking
to
me
about
the
laws
your
honour
a
stranger
in
this
country
and
astray
about
them
things
sure
why
would
i
mind
the
laws
about
whisky
more
than
the
quality
or
the
judge
on
the
bench
do
you
mean
was
not
i
prisint
in
the
myself
when
the
jidge
on
the
bench
judging
a
still
and
across
the
court
came
in
one
with
a
sly
jug
of
potsheen
for
the
jidge
himself
who
prefarred
it
when
the
right
thing
to
claret
and
when
i
seen
that
by
the
laws
a
man
might
talk
himself
dumb
to
me
after
again
potsheen
or
in
favour
of
the
revenue
or
and
there
they
may
go
on
with
their
gaugers
and
their
surveyors
and
their
supervisors
and
their
and
their
setting
one
after
another
or
one
over
the
head
of
another
or
what
way
they
will
we
can
baffle
and
laugh
at
did
i
know
next
door
to
our
inn
last
year
ten
set
upon
one
distiller
and
he
was
too
cunning
for
them
and
it
will
always
be
so
while
ever
the
people
think
it
no
sin
no
till
then
not
all
their
dockets
and
permits
signify
a
rush
or
a
turf
and
the
gauging
rod
even
who
fears
it
they
may
spare
that
rod
for
it
will
never
mend
the
child
how
much
longer
larry
dissertation
on
the
distillery
laws
would
have
continued
had
not
his
ideas
been
interrupted
we
can
not
guess
but
he
saw
he
was
coming
to
a
town
and
he
gathered
up
the
reins
and
plied
the
whip
ambitious
to
make
a
figure
in
the
eyes
of
its
inhabitants
this
town
consisted
of
one
row
of
miserable
huts
sunk
beneath
the
side
of
the
road
the
mud
walls
crooked
in
every
direction
some
of
them
opening
in
wide
cracks
or
zigzag
fissures
from
top
to
bottom
as
if
there
had
just
been
an
earthquake
all
the
roofs
sunk
in
various
places
thatch
off
or
overgrown
with
grass
no
chimneys
the
smoke
making
its
way
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
or
rising
in
clouds
from
the
top
of
the
open
door
dunghills
before
the
doors
and
green
standing
puddles
squalid
children
with
scarcely
rags
to
cover
them
gazing
at
the
carriage
town
said
the
postillion
a
snug
place
when
my
lady
clonbrony
was
at
home
to
whitewash
it
and
the
like
as
they
drove
by
some
men
and
women
put
their
heads
through
the
smoke
out
of
the
cabins
pale
women
with
long
black
or
yellow
locks
men
with
countenances
and
figures
bereft
of
hope
and
energy
wretched
people
said
lord
colambre
it
not
their
fault
neither
said
larry
my
own
uncle
one
of
them
and
as
thriving
and
hard
a
working
man
as
could
be
in
all
ireland
he
was
afore
he
was
tramped
under
foot
and
his
heart
broke
i
was
at
his
funeral
this
time
last
year
and
for
it
may
the
agent
own
heart
if
he
has
any
burn
lord
colambre
interrupted
this
denunciation
by
touching
larry
shoulder
and
asking
some
question
which
as
larry
did
not
distinctly
comprehend
he
pulled
up
the
reins
and
the
various
noises
of
the
vehicle
stopped
suddenly
i
did
not
hear
well
plase
your
honour
are
those
people
pointing
to
a
man
and
woman
curious
figures
who
had
come
out
of
a
cabin
the
door
of
which
the
woman
who
came
out
last
locked
and
carefully
hiding
the
key
in
the
thatch
turned
her
back
upon
the
man
and
they
walked
away
in
different
directions
the
woman
bending
under
a
huge
bundle
on
her
back
covered
by
a
yellow
petticoat
turned
over
her
shoulders
from
the
top
of
this
bundle
the
head
of
an
infant
appeared
a
little
boy
almost
naked
followed
her
with
a
kettle
and
two
girls
one
of
whom
could
but
just
walk
held
her
hand
and
clung
to
her
ragged
petticoat
forming
altogether
a
complete
group
of
beggars
the
woman
stopped
and
looked
back
after
the
man
the
man
was
a
figure
with
gray
hair
a
wallet
hung
at
the
end
of
a
stick
over
one
shoulder
a
in
the
other

walked
off

without
ever
casting

time
till

came
to
a
piece
of
the
road
freshly
covered
with
broken
stones
where
he
was
obliged
again
to
go
slowly
they

and
look
so
hard
and
she
a
lady

born
no
more
than

said
larry
that
no
excuse
for
him
his
heart
as
hard
as
that
stone
said
larry
my
own
people
knew
that
long
ago
and
now
his
own
know
it
and
what
right
have
we
to
complain
since
he
as
bad
to
his
own
flesh
and
blood
as
to
us
with
this
consolation
and
with
a
speed
you
given
to
the
carman
larry
was
driving
off
but
the
carman
called
to
him
and
pointed
to
a
house
at
the
corner
of
which
on
a
high
pole
was
swinging
an
iron
sign
of
three
set
in
a
crooked
frame
and
at
the
window
hung
an
empty
bottle
proclaiming
whisky
within
i
do
care
if
i
do
said
larry
i
no
other
comfort
left
me
in
life
now
i
beg
your
honour
pardon
sir
for
a
minute
added
he
throwing
the
reins
into
the
carriage
to
lord
colambre
as
he
leaped
down
all
remonstrance
and
power
of
lungs
to
reclaim
him
vain
he
darted
into
the
with
the
carman
reappeared
before
lord
colambre
could
accomplish
getting
out
remounted
his
seat
and
taking
the
reins
thank
your
honour
said
he
i
bring
you
into
clonbrony
before
it
yet
though
it
nightfall
and
that
four
good
miles
but
a
spur
in
the
head
is
worth
two
in
the
heel
larry
to
demonstrate
the
truth
of
his
favourite
axiom
drove
off
at
such
a
furious
rate
over
great
stones
left
in
the
middle
of
the
road
by
carmen
who
had
been
driving
in
the
gudgeons
of
their
to
hinder
them
from
lacing
opening
perhaps
from
lacher
to
loosen
that
lord
colambre
thought
life
and
limb
in
imminent
danger
and
feeling
that
at
all
events
the
jolting
and
bumping
was
past
endurance
he
had
recourse
to
larry
shoulder
and
shook
and
pulled
and
called
to
him
to
go
slower
but
in
vain
at
last
the
wheel
struck
full
against
a
heap
of
stones
at
a
turn
of
the
road
the
wooden
came
off
and
the
chaise
was
overset
lord
colambre
was
a
little
bruised
but
glad
to
escape
without
fractured
bones
beg
your
honour
pardon
said
larry
completely
sobered
as
glad
as
the
best
pair
of
boots
ever
i
see
to
see
your
honour
nothing
the
worse
for
it
it
was
the
and
them
barrows
of
loose
stones
that
ought
to
be
fined
anyway
if
there
was
any
justice
in
the
country
pole
is
broke
how
are
we
to
get
on
said
lord
colambre
murder
and
no
smith
nearer
than
clonbrony
nor
rope
even
it
a
folly
to
talk
we
ca
get
to
clonbrony
nor
stir
a
step
backward
or
forward
the
night
then
do
you
mean
to
leave
me
all
night
in
the
middle
of
the
road
cried
lord
colambre
quite
exasperated
it
me
please
your
honour
i
would
not
use
any
jantleman
so
ill
barring
i
could
do
no
other
replied
the
postillion
coolly
then
leaping
across
the
ditch
or
as
he
called
it
the
gripe
of
the
ditch
he
scrambled
up
and
while
he
was
scrambling
said
your
honour
will
lend
me
your
hand
till
i
pull
you
up
the
back
of
the
ditch
the
horses
will
stand
while
we
go
i
find
you
as
pretty
a
lodging
for
the
night
with
a
widow
of
a
brother
of
my
shister
husband
that
was
as
ever
you
slept
in
your
life
for
old
nick
or
dennis
has
not
found
out
yet
and
your
honour
will
be
no
compare
snugger
than
the
inn
at
clonbrony
which
has
no
roof
the
devil
a
stick
but
where
will
i
get
your
honour
hand
for
it
coming
on
so
dark
i
ca
see
rightly
there
you
up
now
safe
yonder
candle
the
house
and
ask
whether
they
can
give
us
a
night
lodging
it
ask
when
i
see
the
light
sure
they
be
proud
to
give
the
traveller
all
the
beds
in
the
house
let
alone
one
take
care
of
the
potato
furrows
that
all
and
follow
me
straight
i
go
on
to
meet
the
dog
who
knows
me
and
might
be
strange
to
your
honour
welcome
were
the
first
words
lord
colambre
heard
when
he
approached
the
cottage
and
welcome
was
in
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
in
the
countenance
of
the
old
woman
who
came
out
shading
her
from
the
wind
and
holding
it
so
as
to
light
the
path
when
he
entered
the
cottage
he
saw
a
cheerful
fire
and
a
neat
pretty
young
woman
making
it
blaze
she
curtsied
put
her
out
of
the
way
set
a
stool
by
the
fire
for
the
stranger
and
repeating
in
a
very
low
tone
of
voice
welcome
retired
down
some
eggs
dear
there
plenty
in
the
bowl
said
the
old
woman
calling
to
her
do
the
bacon
was
not
we
lucky
to
be
up
the
boy
gone
to
bed
but
waken
him
said
she
turning
to
the
postillion
he
help

down
by

began
to
count
the

in
a
little
bit
of

which
she
held
in
her
hand
and
after
she
had
counted

i
ask
what
that
is
said
lord
colambre
looking
at
the
notched
stick
which
the
young
woman
held
in
her
hand
and
on
which
her
eyes
were
still
fixed
it
a
tally
plase
your
honour
oh

a
foreigner
it
the
way
the

do
keep
the
account
of
the
day
work
with
the
overseer
the
bailiff
a
notch
for
every
day
the
bailiff
makes
on
his
stick
and
the
labourer
the
like
on
his
stick
to
tally
and
when
we
come
to
make
up
the
account
it
by
the
notches
we
go
and
there
been
a
mistake
and
is
a
dispute
here
between
our
boy
and
the
overseer
and
she
was
counting
the
boy
tally
that
in
bed
tired
for

and
turning

away
for
your
heart
full
she
went
instantly
the
boy
her
brother
said
lord
colambre
he
her
bachelor
said
the
old
woman
lowering
her
voice
bachelor
is
her
sweetheart
for
she
is
not
my
daughter
though
you
heard
her
call
me
mother
the
boy
my
son
but
i
am
afeard
they
must
give
it
up
for
they
too
poor
and
the
times
is
hard
and
the
agent
harder
than
the
times
there
two
of
them
the
under
and
the
upper
and
they
grind
the
substance
of
one
between
them
and
then
blow
one
away
like
chaff
but
we
not
be
talking
of
that
to
spoil
your
honour
night
rest
the
room
ready
and
here
the
rushlight
she
showed
him
into
a
very
small
but
neat
room
a
bed
said
lord
colambre
these
red
check
curtains
said
she
letting
them
down
have
lasted
well
they
were
give
me
by
a
good
friend
now
far
away
over
the
seas
my
lady
clonbrony
and
made
by
the
prettiest
hands
ever
you
see
her
niece
miss
grace
nugent
and
she
a
little
child
that
time
sweet
love
all
gone
the
old
woman
wiped
a
tear
from
her
eye
and
lord
colambre
did
what
he
could
to
appear
indifferent
she
set
down
the
candle
and
left
the
room
lord
colambre
went
to
bed
but
he
lay
awake
sweet
and
bitter
thoughts
chapter
xi
the
kettle
was
on
the
fire
set
everything
prepared
for
her
guest
by
the
hospitable
hostess
who
thinking
the
gentleman
would
take
tea
to
his
breakfast
had
sent
off
a
gossoon
by
the
first
light
to
clonbrony
for
an
ounce
of
tea
a
quarter
of
sugar
and
a
loaf
of
white
bread
and
there
was
on
the
little
table
good
cream
milk
butter
eggs
all
the
promise
of
an
excellent
breakfast
it
was
a
fresh
morning
and
there
was
a
pleasant
fire
on
the
hearth
neatly
swept
up
the
old
woman
was
sitting
in
her
chimney
corner
behind
a
little
skreen
of
whitewashed
wall
built
out
into
the
room
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
those
who
sat
at
the
fire
from
the
blast
of
the
door
there
was
a
loophole
in
this
wall
to
let
the
light
in
just
at
the
height
of
a
person
head
who
was
sitting
near
the
chimney
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
now
came
through
it
shining
across
the
face
of
the
old
woman
as
she
sat
knitting
lord
colambre
thought
he
had
seldom
seen
a
more
agreeable
countenance
intelligent
eyes
benevolent
smile
a
natural
expression
of
cheerfulness
subdued
by
age
and
misfortune
to
you
kindly
sir
and
i
hope
you
got
the
night
well
a
fine
day
for
us
this
sunday
morning
my
grace
is
gone
to
early
prayers
so
your
honour
will
be
content
with
an
old
woman
to
make
your
breakfast
oh
let
me
put
in
plenty
or
it
will
never
be
good
and
if
your
honour
takes
an
old
hand
will
engage
to
make
that
to
your
liking
anyway
for
by
great
happiness
we
have
what
will
just
answer
for
you
of
the
nicest
meal
the
miller
made
my
grace
a
compliment
of
last
time
she
went
to
the
mill
lord
colambre
observed
that
this
miller
had
good
taste
and
his
lordship
paid
some
compliment
to
grace
beauty
which
the
old
woman
received
with
a
smile
but
turned
off
the
conversation
said
she
looking
out
of
the
window
not
that
there
a
nice
little
garden
the
boy
dug
for
her
and
me
at
his
breakfast
and
dinner
hours
ah
he
a
good
boy
and
a
good
warrant
to
work
and
the
good
son
desarves
the
good
wife
and
it
he
that
will
make
the
good
husband
and
with
my
goodwill
he
and
no
other
shall
get
her
and
with
her
goodwill
the
same
and
i
bid
keep
up
their
heart
and
hope
the
best
for
there
no
use
in
fearing
the
worst
till
it
comes
lord
colambre
wished
very
much
to
know
the
worst
you
would
not
think
a
stranger
impertinent
for
asking
said
he
if
it
would
not
be
painful
to
you
to
explain
impertinent
your
honour
it
very
kind
and
sure
none
a
stranger
to
one
heart
that
feels
for
one
and
for
myself
i
can
talk
of
my
troubles
without
thinking
of
them
so
i
tell
you
all
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
all
that
is
is
that
we
must
quit
and
give
up
this
little
snug
place
and
house
and
farm
and
all
to
the
agent
which
would
be
hard
on
us
and
me
a
widow
when
my
husband
did
all
that
is
done
to
the
land
and
if
your
honour
was
a
judge
you
could
see
if
you
stepped
out
there
has
been
a
deal
done
and
built
the
house
and
all
but
it
plased
heaven
to
take
him
well
he
was
too
good
for
this
world
and
i
satisfied
i
not
saying
a
word
again
that
i
trust
we
shall
meet
in
heaven
and
be
happy
surely
and
meantime
here
my
boy
that
will
make
me
as
happy
as
ever
widow
was
on
earth
if
the
agent
will
let
him
and
i
ca
think
the
agent
though
they
that
know
him
best
call
him
old
nick
would
be
so
wicked
to
take
from
us
that
which
he
never
gave
us
the
good
lord
himself
granted
us
the
lase
the
life
dropped
and
the
years
is
out
but
we
had
a
promise
of
renewal
in
writing
from
the
landlord
god
bless
him
if
he
was
not
away
he
be
a
good
gentleman
and
we
be
happy
and
safe
if
you
have
a
promise
in
writing
of
a
renewal
surely
you
are
safe
whether
your
landlord
is
absent
or
present
no
i
that
makes
a
great
differ
when
there
no
eye
or
hand
over
the
agent
i
would
not
wish
to
speak
or
think
ill
of
him
or
any
man
but
was
he
an
angel
he
could
not
know
to
do
the
tenantry
justice
the
way
he
is
living
always
in
dublin
and
coming
down
to
the
country
only
the
receiving
days
to
make
a
sweep
among
us
and
gather
up
the
rents
in
a
hurry
and
he
in
such
haste
back
to
town
can
just
stay
to
count
over
our
money
and
give
the
receipts
happy
for
us
if
we
get
that
same
but
ca
expect
he
should
have
time
to
see
or
hear
us
or
mind
our
improvements
any
more
than
listen
to
our
complaints
oh
there
great
excuse
for
the
gentleman
if
that
was
any
comfort
for
us
added
she
smiling
if
he
does
not
live
amongst
you
himself
has
not
he
some
who
lives
in
the
country
said
lord
colambre
has
so
he
should
know
your
concerns
does
he
mind
them
should
know
he
should
know
better
but
as
to
minding
our
concerns
your
honour
knows
continued
she
smiling
again
one
in
this
world
must
mind
their
own
concerns
and
it
would
be
a
good
world
if
it
was
even
so
there
a
great
deal
in
all
things
that
do
appear
at
first
sight
dennis
wanted
grace
for
a
wife
for
his
bailiff
but
she
would
not
have
him
and
dennis
was
very
sweet
to
her
himself
but
grace
is
rather
high
with
him
as
proper
and
he
has
a
grudge
again
us
ever
since
yet
indeed
there
added
she
after
another
pause
you
say
i
think
we
are
safe
for
we
have
that
memorandum
in
writing
with
a
pencil
given
under
his
own
hand
on
the
back
of
the
lase
to
me
by
the
same
token
when
my
good
lord
had
his
foot
on
the
step
of
the
coach
going
away
and
i
never
forget
the
smile
of
her
that
got
that
good
turn
done
for
me
miss
grace
and
just
when
she
was
going
to
england
and
london
and
young
as
she
was
to
have
the
thought
to
stop
and
turn
to
the
likes
of
me
oh
then
if
you
could
see
her
and
know
her
as
i
did
that
was
the
comforting
angel
upon
earth
look
and
voice
and
heart
and
all
oh
that
she
was
here
present
this
minute
but
did
you
scald
yourself
said
the
widow
to
lord
colambre
you
must
have
scalded
yourself
for
you
poured
the
kettle
straight
over
your
hand
and
it
boiling
o
deear
to
think
of
so
young
a
gentleman
hand
shaking
so
like
my
own
luckily
to
prevent
her
pursuing
her
observations
from
the
hand
to
the
face
which
might
have
betrayed
more
than
lord
colambre
wished
she
should
know
her
own
grace
came
in
at
this
instant
it
for
you
safe
mother
dear
the
lase
said
grace
throwing
a
packet
into
her
lap
the
old
woman
lifted
up
her
hands
to
heaven
with
the
lease
between
be
to
heaven
grace
passed
on
and
sunk
down
on
the
first
seat
she
could
reach
her
face
flushed
and
looking
much
fatigued
she
loosened
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
and
cloak
i
tired
but
recollecting
herself
she
rose
and
curtsied
to
the
gentleman
tired
ye
dear
after
prayers
we
had
to
go
for
the
agent
was
not
at
prayers
nor
at
home
for
us
when
we
called
we
had
to
go
all
the
way
up
to
the
castle
and
there
by
great
good
luck
we
found
nick
garraghty
himself
come
from
dublin
and
the
lase
in
his
hands
and
he
sealed
it
up
that
way
and
handed
it
to
me
very
civil
i
never
saw
him
so
good
though
he
offered
me
a
glass
of
spirits
which
was
not
manners
to
a
decent
young
woman
in
a
morning
as
brian
noticed
after
brian
would
not
take
any
either
nor
never
does
we
met
dennis
and
the
driver
coming
home
and
he
says
the
rent
must
be
paid
or
instead
of
renewing
he
seize
and
sell
all
mother
dear
i
would
have
dropped
with
the
walk
but
for
brian
arm
a
wonder
dear
what
makes
you
so
weak
that
used
to
be
so
strong
if
we
can
sell
the
cow
for
anything
at
all
to
dennis
since
his
eye
is
set
upon
her
better
let
him
have
her
mother
dear
and
that
and
my
yarn
which
garraghty
says
she
allow
me
for
will
make
up
the
rent
and
brian
need
not
talk
of
america
but
it
must
be
in
golden
guineas
the
agent
will
take
the
rent
no
other
way
and
you
wo
get
a
guinea
for
less
than
five
shillings
well
even
so
it
easy
selling
my
new
gown
to
one
that
covets
it
and
that
will
give
me
in
exchange
the
price
of
the
gold
or
suppose
that
would
not
do
add
this
cloak
it
handsome
and
i
know
a
friend
would
be
glad
to
take
it
and
i
part
it
as
ready
as
look
at
it
at
all
sure
rather
than
that
he
should
be
forced
to
talk
of
emigrating
or
oh
worse
again
listing
for
the
bounty
to
save
us
from
the
cant
or
the
jail
by
going
to
the
hospital
or
his
grave
maybe
oh
mother
child
this
is
what
makes
you
weak
fretting
do
be
that
way
sure
here
the
lase
and
that
good
comfort
and
the
soldiers
will
be
gone
out
of
clonbrony
and
then
that
off
your
mind
and
as
to
america
it
only
talk
i
wo
let
him
he
dutiful
and
would
sooner
sell
my
dresser
and
down
to
my
bed
dear
than
see
you
sell
anything
of
yours
love
promise
me
you
wo
why
did
brian
come
home
all
the
way
with
you
grace
would
have
seen
me
home
said
grace
only
that
he
went
up
a
piece
of
the
mountain
for
some
stones
or
ore
for
the
gentleman
for
he
had
the
manners
to
think
of
him
this
morning
though
shame
for
me
i
had
not
when
i
come
in
or
i
would
not
have
told
you
all
this
and
he
himself
by
see
there
he
is
mother
brian
came
in
very
hot
out
of
breath
with
his
hat
full
of
stones
morrow
to
your
honour
i
was
in
bed
last
night
and
sorry
they
did
not
call
me
up
to
be
of
sarvice
larry
was
telling
us
this
morning
your
honour
from
wales
and
looking
for
mines
in
ireland
and
i
heard
talk
that
there
was
one
on
our
mountain
maybe
you
be
curous
to
see
and
so
i
brought
the
best
i
could
but
i
no
judge
i
neither
thought
lord
colambre
but
he
thanked
the
young
man
and
determined
to
avail
himself
of
larry
misconception
or
false
report
examined
the
stones
very
gravely
and
said
promises
well
lapis
caliminaris
schist
stone
rhomboidal
crystal
blend
garrawachy
and
all
the
strange
names
he
could
think
of
jumbling
them
together
at
a
venture
lase
is
it
cried
the
young
man
with
joy
sparkling
in
his
eyes
as
his
mother
held
up
the
packet
all
safe
and
he
an
honest
man
and
shame
on
me
that
could
suspect
he
meant
us
wrong
lend
me
the
papers
he
cracked
the
seals
and
taking
off
the
cover
the
lase
sure
enough
shame
on
me
but
stay
where
the
memorandum
there
sure
said
his
mother
my
lord
pencil
writ
it
i
do
grace
dear
look
the
young
man
put
it
into
her
hands
and
stood
without
power
to
utter
a
syllable
not
here
it
gone
no
sign
of
it
heaven
that
ca
be
said
the
old
woman
putting
on
her
spectacles
me
see
i
remember
the
very
spot
taken
away
it
rubbed
clean
out
oh
was
i
fool
but
who
could
have
thought
he
be
the
villain
the
young
man
seemed
neither
to
see
nor
hear
but
to
be
absorbed
in

lord
colambre
speaking
in
the
tone
of
a
master
striking
the
young
man
shoulder
who
was
kneeling
at
grace
feet
but
recollecting
and
restraining
himself
he
added
in
a
quiet
voice
promise
you
i
shall
never
forget
the
hospitality
i
have
received
in
this
house
and
i
am
sorry
to

obliged

in
distress
these
words
uttered
with
difficulty
he
hurried
out
of
the
house
and
into
his
carriage
back
to
them
said
he
to
the
postillion
back
and
ask
whether
if
i
should

my
good
friend
larry

me
to
clonbrony
and
do
not
say
another
word
for
i
not
in
a
talking
humour
larry
nodded
mounted
and
drove
to
clonbrony
clonbrony
was
now
a
melancholy
scene
the
houses
which
had
been
built
in
a
better
style
of
architecture
than
usual
were
in
a
ruinous
condition
the
dashing
was
off
the
walls
no
glass
in
the
windows
and
many
of
the
roofs
without
slates
for
the
stillness
of
the
place
lord
colambre
in
some
measure
accounted
by
considering
that
it
was
sunday
therefore
of
course
all
the
shops
were
shut
up
and
all
the
people
at
prayers
he
alighted
at
the
inn
which
completely
answered
larry
representation
of
it
nobody
to
be
seen
but
a
drunken
waiter
who
as
well
as
he
could
articulate
informed
lord
colambre
that
mistress
was
in
her
bed
since
the
hostler
at
the
and
the
cook
at
second
prayers
lord
colambre
walked
to
the
church
but
the
church
gate
was
locked
and
broken
a
calf
two
pigs
and
an
ass
in
the
churchyard
and
several
boys
with
more
of
skin
apparent
than
clothes
were
playing
at
hustlecap
upon
a
tombstone
which
upon
nearer
observation
he
saw
was
the
monument
of
his
own
family
one
of
the
boys
came
to
the
gate
and
told
lord
colambre
was
no
use
in
going
into
the
church
becaase
there
was
no
church
there
nor
had
not
been
this
twelvemonth
becaase
there
was
no
curate
and
the
parson
was
away
always
since
the
lord
was
at
home
that
is
was
not
at
home
he
nor
the
family
lord
colambre
returned
to
the
inn
where
after
waiting
a
considerable
time
he
gave
up
the
point
he
could
not
get
any
dinner
and
in
the
evening
he
walked
out
again
into
the
town
he
found
several
however
open
which
were
full
of
people
all
of
them
as
busy
and
as
noisy
as
possible
he
observed
that
the
interest
was
created
by
an
advertisement
of
several
farms
on
the
clonbrony
estate
to
be
set
by
nicholas
garraghty
esq
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
being
witness
incognito
to
various
schemes
for
outwitting
the
agents
and
defrauding
the
landlord
but
on
a
sudden
the
scene
was
changed
a
boy
ran
in
crying
out
that
dennis
was
riding
down
the
hill
into
the
town
and
if
you
would
not
have
the
license
said
the
boy
care
of
yourself
you
would
have
the
licence
lord
colambre
perceived
by
what
followed
meant
you
have
not
a
licence
brannagan
immediately
snatched
an
untasted
glass
of
whisky
from
a
customer
lips
who
cried
murder
gave
it
and
the
bottle
he
held
in
his
hand
to
his
wife
who
swallowed
the
spirits
and
ran
away
with
the
bottle
and
glass
into
some
back
hole
whilst
the
bystanders
laughed
saying
thought
of
peggy
out
all
of
you
at
the
back
door
for
the
love
of
heaven
if
you
would
be
the
ruin
of
me
said
the
man
of
the
house
setting
a
ladder
to
a
corner
of
the
shop
hoist
me
up
the
keg
to
the
loft
added
he
running
up
the
ladder
one
of
yees
step
up
street
and
give
rose
notice
for
she
selling
too
the
keg
was
hoisted
up
the
ladder
removed
the
shop
cleared
of
all
the
customers
the
shutters
shut
the
door
barred
the
counter
cleaned
your
stones
sir
if
you
plase
said
the
wife
as
she
rubbed
the
counter
say
nothing
of
what
you
seen
at
all
but
that
you
a
stranger
and
a
traveller
seeking
a
lodging
if
you
questioned
or
waiting
to
see
dennis
there
no
smell
of
whisky
in
it
now
is
there
sir
lord
colambre
could
not
flatter
her
so
far
as
to
say
this
he
could
only
hope
no
one
would
perceive
it
and
if
he
would
the
smell
of
whisky
was
nothing
as
the
wife
affirmed
it
was
everywhere
in
nature
and
no
proof
again
any
one
good
or
bad
dennis
may
come
when
he
will
or
old
nick
himself
so
she
tied
up
a
blue
handkerchief
over
her
head
and
had
the
toothache
bad
lord
colambre
turned
to
look
for
the
man
of
the
house
safe
in
bed
said
the
wife
bed
when
you
turned
your
head
while
i
was
tying
the
handkerchief
over
my
face
within
the
room
look
he
is
snug
and
there
he
was
in
bed
certainly
and
his
clothes
on
the
chest
a
knock
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
dennis
himself
stay
till
i
unbar
the
door
said
the
woman
and
making
a
great
difficulty
she
let
him
in
groaning
and
saying
was
all
done
up
for
the
night
plase
your
honour
and
myself
with
the
toothache
very
bad
and
the
lodger
that
going
to
take
an
egg
only
before
he
go
into
his
bed
my
man
in
it
and
asleep
long
ago
with
a
magisterial
air
though
with
a
look
of
blank
disappointment
dennis
garraghty
walked
on
looked
into
the
room
saw
the
good
man
of
the
house
asleep
heard
him
snore
and
then
returning
asked
lord
colambre
he
was
and
what
brought
him
there
our
hero
said
he
was
from
england
and
a
traveller
and
now
bolder
grown
as
a
geologist
he
talked
of
his
specimens
and
his
hopes
of
finding
a
mine
in
the
neighbouring
mountains
then
adopting
as
well
as
he
could
the
servile
tone
and
abject
manner
in
which
he
found
dennis
was
to
be
addressed
hoped
he
might
get
encouragement
from
the
gentleman
at
the
head
of
the
estate
bore
is
it
well
do
bore
me
about
it
i
ca
give
you
any
answer
now
my
good
friend
i
engaged
out
he
strutted
to
him
up
the
town
if
you
have
a
mind
to
get
your
answer
whispered
the
woman
lord
colambre
followed
for
he
wished
to
see
the
end
of
this
scene
sir
what
are
you
following
and
sticking
to
me
like
my
shadow
for
said
dennis
turning
suddenly
upon
lord
colambre
his
lordship
bowed
low
for
my
answer
sir
when
you
are
at
leisure
or
may
i
call
upon
you
tomorrow
seem
to
be
a
civil
kind
of
fellow
but
as
to
boring
i
do
know
if
you
undertake
it
at
your
own
expense
i
dare
say
there
may
be
minerals
in
the
ground
well
you
may
call
at
the
castle
and
when
my
brother
has
done
with
the
tenantry
i
speak
to
him
for
you
and
we
consult
together
and
see
what
we
think
it
too
late
in
ireland
nobody
speaks
to
a
gentleman
about
business
after
dinner
your
servant
sir
anybody
can
show
you
the
way
to
the
castle
in
the
morning
and
pushing
by
his
lordship
he
called
to
a
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
who
had
obviously
been
waiting
for
him
he
went
under
a
gateway
with
this
man
and
gave
him
a
bag
of
guineas
he
then
called
for
his
horse
which
was
brought
to
him
by
a
man
whom
colambre
had
heard
declaring
that
he
would
bid
for
the
land
that
was
advertised
whilst
another
who
had
the
same
intentions
most
respectfully
held
dennis
stirrup
whilst
he
mounted
without
thanking
either
of
these
men
dennis
clapped
spurs
to
his
steed
and
rode
away
no
thanks
indeed
were
deserved
for
the
moment
he
was
out
of
hearing
both
cursed
him
after
the
manner
of
their
country
luck
go
with
you
then
and
may
you
break
your
neck
before
you
get
home
if
it
was
not
for
the
lase
i
to
get
and
that
paid
for
lord
colambre
followed
the
crowd
into
a
where
a
new
scene
presented
itself
to
his
view
the
man
to
whom
dennis
gave
the
bag
of
gold
was
now
selling
this
very
gold
to
the
tenants
who
were
to
pay
their
rent
next
day
at
the
castle
the
agent
would
take
nothing
but
gold
the
same
guineas
were
bought
and
sold
several
times
over
to
the
great
profit
of
the
agent
and
loss
of
the
poor
tenants
for
as
the
rents
were
paid
the
guineas
were
resold
to
another
set
and
the
remittances
made
through
bankers
to
the
landlord
who
as
the
poor
man
who
explained
the
transaction
to
lord
colambre
expressed
it
nothing
by
the
business
bad
or
good
but
the
of
the
tenantry
the
higgling
for
the
price
of
the
gold
the
time
lost
in
disputing
about
the
goodness
of
the
notes
among
some
poor
tenants
who
could
not
read
or
write
and
who
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
man
with
the
bag
in
his
hand
the
vexation
the
useless
harassing
of
all
who
were
obliged
to
submit
ultimately
lord
colambre
saw
and
all
this
time
he
endured
the
smell
of
tobacco
and
whisky
and
of
the
sound
of
various
brogues
the
din
of
men
wrangling
brawling
threatening
whining
drawling
cajoling
cursing
and
every
variety
of
wretchedness
is
this
my
father
town
of
clonbrony
thought
lord
colambre
this
ireland
no
it
is
not
ireland
let
me
not
like
most
of
those
who
forsake
their
native
country
traduce
it
let
me
not
even
to
my
own
mind
commit
the
injustice
of
taking
a
speck
for
the
whole
what
i
have
just
seen
is
the
picture
only
of
that
to
which
an
irish
estate
and
irish
tenantry
may
be
degraded
in
the
absence
of
those
whose
duty
and
interest
it
is
to
reside
in
ireland
to
uphold
justice
by
example
and
authority
but
who
neglecting
this
duty
commit
power
to
bad
hands
and
bad
hearts
abandon
their
tenantry
to
oppression
and
their
property
to
ruin
it
was
now
fine
moonlight
and
lord
colambre
met
with
a
boy
who
said
he
could
show
him
a
short
way
across
the
fields
to
the
widow
cottage
chapter
xii
all
were
asleep
at
the
cottage
when
lord
colambre
arrived
except
the
widow
who
was
sitting
up
waiting
for
him
and
who
had
brought
her
dog
into
the
house
that
he
might
not
fly
at
him
or
bark
at
his
return
she
had
a
roast
chicken
ready
for
her
guest
and
it
was
but
this
she
never
told
him
the
only
chicken
she
had
left
all
the
others
had
been
sent
with
the
as
a
present
to
the
lady
while
he
was
eating
his
supper
which
he
ate
with
the
better
appetite
as
he
had
had
no
dinner
the
good
woman
took
down
from
the
shelf
a
which
she
gave
him
not
that
your
book
said
she
boy
brian
found
it
after
you
in
the
potato
furrow
where
you
dropped
it
you
said
lord
colambre
are
bank
notes
in
it
which
i
could
not
afford
to
lose
there
said
she
never
opened
it
nor
i
then
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
about
grace
and
the
young
man
the
widow
answered
are
all
in
heart
now
i
thank
ye
kindly
sir
for
asking
they
sleep
easy
anyway
and
i
in
great
spirits
for
them
and
myself
for
all
smooth
now
after
we
parted
you
brian
saw
dennis
himself
about
the
lase
and
memorandum
which
he
never
denied
but
knew
nothing
about
but
be
that
as
it
may
says
he
you
improving
tenants
and
i
confident
my
brother
will
consider
ye
so
what
you
do
is
you
give
up
the
possession
to
myself
that
will
call
for
it
by
just
for
form
sake
and
then
go
up
to
the
castle
with
the
new
lase
ready
drawn
in
your
hand
and
if
all
paid
off
clear
of
the
rent
and
all
that
due
you
get
the
new
lase
signed
i
promise
you
that
upon
the
word
and
honour
of
a
gentleman
and
there
no
going
beyond
that
you
know
sir
so
my
boy
came
home
as
light
as
a
feather
and
as
gay
as
a
lark
to
bring
us
the
good
news
only
he
was
afraid
we
might
not
make
up
the
rent
guineas
and
all
and
because
he
could
not
get
paid
for
the
work
he
done
on
account
of
the
mistake
in
the
overseer
tally
i
sold
the
cow
to
a
neighbour
but
needs
must
as
they
say
when
old
nick
drives
said
the
widow
smiling
still
it
was
but
paper
we
got
for
the
cow
then
that
must
be
gold
before
the
agent
would
take
or
touch
it
so
i
was
laying
out
to
sell
the
dresser
and
had
taken
the
plates
and
cups
and
little
things
off
it
and
my
boy
was
lifting
it
out
with
andy
the
carpenter
that
was
agreeing
for
it
when
in
comes
grace
all
rosy
and
out
of
breath
it
a
wonder
i
minded
her
run
out
and
not
missed
her
mother
says
she
here
the
gold
for
you
do
be
stirring
your
dresser
and
where
your
gown
and
cloak
grace
says
i
but
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
maybe
i
tiring
you
lord
colambre
encouraged
her
to
go
on
where
your
gown
and
cloak
grace
says
gone
says
she
the
cloak
was
too
warm
and
heavy
and
i
do
doubt
mother
but
it
was
that
helped
to
make
me
faint
this
morning
and
as
to
the
gown
sure
i
a
very
nice
one
here
that
you
spun
for
me
yourself
mother
and
that
i
prize
above
all
the
gowns
ever
came
out
of
a
loom
and
that
brian
said
become
me
to
his
fancy
above
any
gown
ever
he
see
me
wear
and
what
could
i
wish
for
more
now
i
a
mind
to
scold
her
for
going
to
sell
the
gown
to
me
but
i
do
know
how
it
was
i
could
scold
her
just
then
so
kissed
her
and
brian
the
same
and
that
was
what
no
man
ever
did
before
and
she
had
a
mind
to
be
angry
with
him
but
could
not
nor
ought
not
says
i
for
he
as
good
as
your
husband
now
grace
and
no
man
can
part
yees
now
says
i
putting
their
hands
together
well
i
never
saw
her
look
so
pretty
nor
there
was
not
a
happier
boy
that
minute
on
god
earth
than
my
son
nor
a
happier
mother
than
myself
and
i
thanked
god
that
had
given
them
to
me
and
down
they
both
fell
on
their
knees
for
my
blessing
little
worth
as
it
was
and
my
heart
blessing
they
had
and
i
laid
my
hands
upon
them
it
the
priest
you
must
get
to
do
this
for
you
says
i
and
brian
just
held
up
the
ring
to
show
me
all
was
ready
on
his
part
but
could
not
speak
then
there
no
america
any
more
said
grace
low
to
me
and
her
heart
was
on
her
lips
but
the
colour
came
and
went
and
i
was
afeared
she
have
swooned
again
but
not
for
sorrow
so
i
carried
her
off
well
if
she
was
not
my
own
but
she
is
not
my
own
born
so
i
may
say
it
there
never
was
a
better
girl
nor
a
more
nor
generous
never
thinking
anything
she
could
do
or
give
too
much
for
them
she
loved
and
anything
at
all
would
do
for
herself
the
sweetest
natured
and
tempered
both
and
always
was
from
this
high
the
bond
that
held
all
together
and
joy
of
the
house
like
her
namesake
cried
lord
colambre
your
honour
not
it
late
said
lord
colambre
stretching
himself
and
gaping
walked
a
great
way
the
old
woman
lighted
his
rushlight
showed
him
to
his
red
check
bed
and
wished
him
a
very
good
night
not
without
some
slight
sentiment
of
displeasure
at
his
gaping
thus
at
the
panegyric
on
her
darling
grace
before
she
left
the
room
however
her
resentment
vanished
upon
his
saying
that
he
hoped
with
her
permission
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
of
the
young
couple
early
in
the
morning
brian
went
to
the
priest
to
ask
his
reverence
when
it
would
be
convenient
to
marry
him
and
whilst
he
was
gone
dennis
garraghty
came
to
the
cottage
to
receive
the
rent
and
possession
the
rent
was
ready
in
gold
and
counted
into
his
hand
occasion
for
a
receipt

a
new
lase

a
receipt
in
full
for
everything
well
sir

the
widow

pair
of

and
here
they
are
ready
all
to
signing
dennis
said
his
brother
must
settle
that
part
of
the
business
and
that
they
must
carry
them
up
to
the
castle
first
give
me
the
possession
then
as
he
instructed
her
she
gave
up
the
key
of
the
door
to
him
and
a
bit
of
the
thatch
of
the
house
and
he
raked
out
the
fire
and
said
every
living
creature
must
go
out
only
form
of
law
said
he
must
my
lodger
get
up
and
turn
out
sir
said
she
must
turn
out
to
be
sure
not
a
living
soul
must
be
left
in
it
or
it
no
legal
possession
properly
who
is
your
lodger
on
lord
colambre
appearing
dennis
showed
some
surprise
and
said
thought

man
who
spoke
to
me
at
his
house
about

the
widow
sir

you

walk
out
of
this
lodging
now
if

please
my
good
friend
so
dennis
pushed
his
lordship
out
by
the
shoulders
repeating
as
the
widow
turned
back
and
looked
with
some
surprise
and
alarm
for
form
sake
only
for
form
sake
then
locking
the
door
took
the
key
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
the
widow
held
out
her
hand
for
it
form

so
said
brian
so
she
let
him
lead
her
into
the
priest
house
and
she
did
not
make
any
of
the
awkward
draggings
back
or
ridiculous
scenes
of
grimace
sometimes
exhibited
on
these
occasions
but
blushing
rosy
red
yet
with
more
than
could
have
been
expected
from
her
timid
nature
she
gave
her
hand
to
the
man
she
loved
and
listened
with
attentive
devotion
to
the
holy
ceremony
thought
lord
colambre
whilst
he
congratulated
the
bride
i
ever
be
as
happy
as
these
poor
people
are
at
this
moment
he
longed
to
make
them
some
little
present
but
all
he
could
venture
at
this
moment
was
to
pay
the
priest
dues
the
priest
positively
refused
to
take
anything
are
the
best
couple
in
my
parish
said
he

thankful

grace

said
lord
colambre
you
very
kind
said
the
widow
smiling
i
would
doubt
you
if
you
had
the
power
i
hope
then
the
agent
will
give
you
encouragement
about
them
mines
that
we
may
keep
you
among
us
am
determined
to
settle
among
you
generous
people
cried
lord
colambre
the
agent
gives
me
encouragement
or
not
added
he
it
was
a
long
walk
to
clonbrony
castle
the
old
woman
as
she
said
herself
would
not
have
been
able
for
it
but
for
a
lift
given
to
her
by
a
friendly
carman
whom
they
met
on
the
road
with
an
empty
car
this
carman
was
finnucan
who
dissipated
lord
colambre
fears
of
meeting
and
being
recognised
by
raffarty
for
he
in
answer
to
the
question
of
is
at
the
castle
replied
raffarty
will
be
in
it
afore
night
but
she
on
the
road
still
there
none
but
old
nick
in
it
yet
and
he
more
of
a
neger
than
ever
for
think
that
he
would
not
pay
me
a
farthing
for
the
carriage
of
his
shister
boxes
and
bandboxes
down
if
you
going
to
have
any
dealings
with
him
god
grant
ye
a
safe
deliverance
said
the
widow
and
her
son
and
daughter
lord
colambre
attention
was
now
engaged
by
the
view
of
the
castle
and
park
of
clonbrony
he
had
not
seen
it
since
he
was
six
years
old
some
faint
reminiscence
from
his
childhood
made
him
feel
or
fancy
that
he
knew
the
place
it
was
a
fine
castle
spacious
park
but
all
about
it
from
the
broken
piers
at
the
great
entrance
to
the
messy
gravel
and
loose
steps
at
the
had
an
air
of
desertion
and
melancholy
walks
overgrown
shrubberies
wild
plantations
run
up
into
bare
poles
fine
trees
cut
down
and
lying
on
the
gravel
in
lots
to
be
sold
a
hill
that
had
been
covered
with
an
oak
wood
in
which
in
his
childhood
our
hero
used
to
play
and
which
he
called
the
black
forest
was
gone
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
white
stumps
of
the
trees
for
it
had
been
freshly
cut
down
to
make
up
the
last
how
it
went
when
sold
but
no
matter
said
finnucan
all
it
the
back
way
into
the
yard
i
take
you
i
suppose
and
such
a
yard
it
no
matter
repeated
lord
colambre
to
himself
all
alike
in
the
kitchen
a
great
dinner
was
dressing
for
garraghty
friends
who
were
to
make
merry
with
him
when
the
business
of
the
day
was
over
the
keys
of
the
cellar
till
i
get
out
the
claret
for
after

says
one
the

and
very
proper
when

your
nose
out
of
the
kitchen
young
man

said
the
agent
cook
shutting
the
door
in
lord

face
the

the
office

said
the
footman
the
office
is
damp
for
him
and
it
not
there
he

anybody
but
in
my
lady
so
up
the
grand
staircase
they
went
and
through
the
magnificent
apartments
hung
with
pictures
of
great
value
spoiling
with
damp
is
it
a
pity
to
see
them
there
my
lady
and
all

said
the
widow
lord
colambre
stopped
before
a
portrait
of
miss

he

one
of
the
tenants

the
surveyor

the
replied
another
should

viceroy

but
in
the
there
was
a
full
levee
and
fine
smell
of
greatcoats
would
you
put
your
hats
on
the
silk
cushions
said
the
widow
to
some
men
in
the
doorway
who
were
throwing
off
their
greasy
hats
on
a
damask
not
where
else
the
lady
was
in
it

she
to

he

irish
i

manners
good
woman

ye
added
he
as
he
shook
the
ink
out
of
his
pen
on
the
wilton
carpet
when
he
had
finished
signing
his
name
to
a
paper
on
his
knee
may
wait
long
before
you
get
to
the
speech
of
the
great
man
said
another
who
was
working
his
way
through
numbers
they
continued
pushing
forward
till
they
came
within
sight
of
nicholas
garraghty
seated
in
state
and
a
worse
countenance
or
a
more
perfect
picture
of
an
insolent
petty
tyrant
in
office
lord
colambre
had
never
beheld
we
forbear
all
further
detail
of
this
levee
all
the
same
as
lord
colambre
repeated
to
himself
on
every
fresh
instance
of
roguery
or
oppression
to
which
he
was
witness
and
having
completely
made
up
his
mind
on
the
subject
he
sat
down
quietly
in
the
background
waiting
till
it
should
come
to
the
widow
turn
to
be
dealt
with
for
he
was
now
interested
only
to
see
how
she
would
be
treated
the
room
gradually
thinned
dennis
garraghty
came
in
and
sat
down
at
the
table
to
help
his
brother
to
count
the
heaps
of
gold
dennis
i
glad
to
see
you
as
kind
as
your
promise

me
here

the
widow
walking
up
to
him

a
good
word
for
me
here

she

strangeness
in
bringing
money
or
taking

said
nicholas
garraghty
holding

his
hand

me
beg

you
will
consider
yourself
as
at
home
in
this
house
whilst
any
circumstances
make
it
desirable
to
you
the
hospitality
you
showed
me
you
can
not
think
that
i
now
forget
my
lord
you
too
good
how
few
too
kind
kinder
than
my
own
and
bursting
into
tears
she
escaped
out
of
the
room
lord
colambre
returned
to
the
party
round
the
table
who
were
in
various
attitudes
of
astonishment
and
with
faces
of
fear
horror
hope
joy
doubt
continued
his
lordship
incurred
if
not
by
vice
will
always
find
a
refuge
in
this
house
i
speak
in
my
father
name
for
i
know
i
speak
his
sentiments
but
never
more
shall
vice
said
he
darting
such
a
look
at
the
brother
agents
as
they
felt
to
the
backbone
more
shall
vice
shall
fraud
enter
here
he
paused
and
there
was
a
momentary
silence
spoke
the
true
thing
and
the
rael
gentleman
my
own
heart
satisfied
said
brian
folding
his
arms
and
standing
erect
so
is
mine
said
grace
taking
breath
with
a
deep
sigh
the
widow
advancing
put
on
her
spectacles
and
looking
up
close
at
lord
colambre
face
it
a
wonder
i
did
know
the
family
likeness
lord
colambre
now
recollecting
that
he
still
wore
the
old
greatcoat
threw
it
off
bless
him
then
now
i
know
him
anywhere
i
willing
to
die
now
for
we
all
be
happy
lord
since
it
is
so
my
lord
may
i
ask
you
said
garraghty
now
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
able
to
articulate
but
scarcely
to
express
his
ideas
what
your
lordship
hinted
just
now
hinted
nothing
sir
i
spoke
plainly
beg
pardon
my
lord
said
old
nick
vice
was
levelled
at
me
because
if
it
was
my
lord
trying
to
stand
erect
me
tell
your
lordship
if
i
could
think
it
was
it
did
not
hit
you
sir
no
matter
at
whom
it
was
levelled
let
me
ask
my
lord
if
i
may
presume
whether
in
what
you
suggested
by
the
word
fraud
your
lordship
had
any
particular
meaning
said
dennis
very
particular
meaning
sir
feel
in
your
pocket
for
the
key
of
this
widow
house
and
deliver
it
to
her
if
that
all
the
meaning
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
i
never
meant
to
detain
it
longer
than
till
the
leases
were
signed
said
dennis
i
ready
to
sign
the
leases
this
minute
said
the
brother
it
sir
this
minute
i
have
read
them
i
will
be
answerable
to
my
father
as
to
that
my
lord
i
have
power
to
sign
for
your
father
he
signed
the
leases
they
were
duly
witnessed
by
lord
colambre
deliver
this
as
my
act
and
deed
said
garraghty
lord
continued
he
see
at
the
first
word
from
you
and
had
i
known
sooner
the
interest
you
took
in
the
family
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
for
i
make
it
a
principle
to
oblige
you
my
lord
me
said
lord
colambre
with
disdain
when
gentlemen
and
noblemen
travel
incognito
and
lodge
in
cabins
added
dennis
with
a
satanic
smile
glancing
his
eye
on
grace
have
good
reasons
no
doubt
not
judge
my
heart
by
your
own
sir
said
lord
colambre
coolly
two
things
in
nature
can
i
trust
be
more
different
my
purpose
in
travelling
incognito
has
been
fully
answered
i
was
determined
to
see
and
judge
how
my
father
estates
were
managed
and
i
have
seen
compared
and
judged
i
have
seen
the
difference
between
the
clonbrony
and
the
colambre
property
and
i
shall
represent
what
i
have
seen
to
my
father
to
that
my
lord
if
we
are
to
come
to
that
but
i
trust
your
lordship
will
suffer
me
to
explain
these
go
about
your
business
my
good
friends
you
have
all
you
want
and
my
lord
after
dinner
when
you
are
cool
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
make
you
sensible
that
things
have
been
represented
to
your
lordship
in
a
mistaken
light
and
i
flatter
myself
i
shall
convince
you
i
have
not
only
always
acted
the
part
of
a
friend
to
the
family
but
am
particularly
willing
to
conciliate
your
lordship
goodwill
said
he
sweeping
the
rouleaus
of
gold
into
a
bag
accommodation
in
my
power
at
any
time
want
no
accommodation
sir
were
i
starving
i
would
accept
of
none
from
you
never
can
you
conciliate
my
goodwill
for
you
can
never
deserve
it
that
be
the
case
my
lord
i
must
conduct
myself
accordingly
but
it
fair
to
warn
you
before
you
make
any
representation
to
my
lord
clonbrony
that
if
he
should
think
of
changing
his
agent
there
are
accounts
to
be
settled
between
us
that
may
be
a
consideration
sir
no
consideration
my
father
never
shall
be
the
slave
of
such
a
paltry
consideration
very
well
my
lord
you
know
best
if
you
choose
to
make
an
assumpsit
i
sure
i
shall
not
object
to
the
security
your
lordship
will
be
of
age
soon
i
know
i
sure
i
satisfied
but
added
he
with
a
malicious
smile
rather
apprehend
you
do
know
what
you
undertake
i
only
premise
that
the
balance
of
accounts
between
us
is
not
what
can
properly
be
called
a
paltry
consideration
that
point
perhaps
sir
you
and
i
may
differ
well
my
lord
you
will
follow
your
own
principles
if
it
suits
your
convenience
it
does
or
not
sir
i
shall
abide
by
my
principles
the
letters
to
the
when
do
you
go
to
england
my
lord
sir
said

nicholas
and
dennis
with
an
air
of
dismay
nicholas
got
up

out
of
the
window
and
whispered
something
to
his
brother
who
instantly
left
the
room
colambre
saw
the
at
the
door
which
had
brought
raffarty
to
the
castle
and
larry
standing
beside
it
his
lordship
instantly
threw
up
the

and
holding
between

finger
and
thumb
a
piece
cried

proffered
bribe
to
each
offer
larry
replied
ca

honour
they
engaged
and
looking
up
to
the

at

in
consternation

that
larry

some
dinner
and
whilst
the
postillion
was
eating
and
the
horses
finishing
their
oats
his
lordship
wrote
the
following
letter

which
to
prevent

possibility
of
accident
he
determined
to
put

his
own
hand

passed
through
the
town

request
to
you
that

was
ready
and
lord
colambre
having

eaten
a
slice
of
his
own
venison
ran
down
to
the
carriage
followed
by
the
thanks
and
blessings
of
the
widow
her
son
and
daughter
who
could
hardly
make
their
way
after
him

multitude
of
voices

stopped
at
the
and
beckoned
to
the
widow
before
whom
others
had
pressed
an
opening

made
for

instantly
there
that

chapter
xiii
larry
drove
off
at
full
gallop
and
kept
on
at
a
good
rate
till
he
got
out
of
the
great
gate
and
beyond
the
sight
of
the
crowd
then
pulling
up
he
turned
to
lord
colambre
your
honour
i
did
not
know
nor
guess
ye
was
my
lord
when
i
let
you
have
the
horses

not
know
who
you
was
from
adam
i
take
my
affidavit

occasion
said
lord
colambre

you
do
repent
letting
me
have
the
horses
now
you
do
know
who
i
am
not
at
all
sure
i
as
glad
as
the
best
horse
i
ever
crossed
that
your
honour
is
my
lord
but
i
was
only
telling
your
honour
that
you
might
not
be
looking
upon
me
as
a
do
not
look
upon
you
as
a
larry
but
keep
on
that
time
may
serve
me
in
two
words
he
explained
his
cause
of
haste
and
no
sooner
explained
than
understood
larry
thundered
away
through
the
town
of
clonbrony
bending
over
his
horses
plying
the
whip
and
lending
his
very
soul
at
every
lash
with
much
difficulty
lord
colambre
stopped
him
at
the
end
of
the
town
at
the
the
post
was
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
overtake
the
mail
said
larry
and
as
he
spoke
he
slid
down
from
his
seat
and
darted
into
the
reappearing
in
a
few
moments
with
a
copper
of
ale
and
a
horn
in
his
hand
he
and
another
man
held
open
the
horses
mouths
and
poured
the
ale
through
the
horn
down
their
throats
they
go
with
spirit
and
with
the
hope
of
overtaking
the
mail
larry
made
them
go
life
or
death
as
he
said
but
in
vain
at
the
next
stage
at
his
own
larry
roared
for
fresh
horses
till
he
got
them
harnessed
them
with
his
own
hands
holding
the
piece
which
lord
colambre
had
given
him
in
his
mouth
all
the
while
for
he
could
not
take
time
to
put
it
into
his
pocket
ye
i
wish
i
was
driving
you
all
the
way
then
said
he
the
other
postillion
was
not
yet
ready
your
honour
sees
said
he
putting
his
head
into
the
carriage
of
them
garraghties
old
nick
and
dennis
the
best
part
that
is
the
worst
part
of
what

for
it
but

best
to

the
meantime
my
good
fellow
keep
away
from
the
sign
of
the
a
man
of
your
sense
to
drink
and
make
an
idiot
and
a
brute
of
yourself
and
it
was
only
when
i
had
lost
hope
i
took
to
it
but
now
bring
me
the
book
one
of
yees
out
of
the
landlady
by
the
virtue
of
this
book
and
by
all
the
books
that

was
shut
and
opened
i
wo
touch
a
drop
of
spirits
good
or
bad
till

see
your
honour

or
some
of
the
family

time

long
i
live
on

if
you
disappoint
me
i
do
swear
but
i
take
to
the
whisky
for
comfort
all
the
rest
of
my
days
but
do
be
staying
here
wasting
your
time
advising
me
bartley

the
reins
ca
ye
cried
he
giving
them
to
the
fresh
postillion
keep
on
for
your
life
for
there
thousands
of
pounds
depending
on
the
race
so
off
off
bartley
with
speed
of
light
bartley
did
his
best
and
such
was
the
excellence
of
the
roads
that
notwithstanding
the
rate
at
which
our
hero
travelled
he
arrived
safely
in
dublin
and
just
in
time
to
put
his
letter
into
the
and
to
sail
in
that
night
packet
the
wind
was
fair
when
lord
colambre
went
on
board
but
before
they
got
out
of
the
bay
it
changed
they
made
no
way
all
night
in
the
course
of
the
next
day
they
had
the
mortification
to
see
another
packet
from
dublin
sail
past
them
and
when
they
landed
at
holyhead
were
told
the
packet
which
had
left
ireland
twelve
hours
after
them
had
been
in
an
hour
before
them
the
passengers
had
taken
their
places
in
the
coach
and
engaged
what
horses
could
be
had
lord
colambre
was
afraid
that
garraghty
was
one
of
them
a
person
exactly
answering
his
description

taken
four
horses
and
set
out
half
an
hour
before

just
as
those
who
had
taken
their
places
in
the

were
getting
into
the

gentleman
with
whom
he
had
been
acquainted
in
dublin

barrister
who
was
come
over
during
the
long
vacation
to
make

explained
the
reason

reach
london

had
the
to
give
up
to
him
his
place

you
find
the
other
agent
in
ireland
or
anywhere
else
will
do
that
to
my
knowledge
i
never
did
anything
by
word
or
deed
to
offend
my
lord
colambre
nor
could
not
for
i
never
saw
him
but
for
ten
minutes
in
my
days
and
then
he
was
in
such
a
foaming
passion
begging
his
lordship
pardon
owing
to
the
misrepresentations
he
met
with
of
me
i
presume
from
a
parcel
of
blackguards
that
he
went
amongst
incognito
he
would
not
let
me
or
my
brother
dennis
say
a
word
to
set
him
right
but
exposed
me
before
all
the
tenantry
and
then
threw
himself
into
a
hack
and
drove
off
here
to
stop
the
signing
of
these
leases
i
perceive
but
i
trust
concluded
he
putting
the
replenished
down
with
a
heavy
sound
on
the
table
opposite
to
lord
clonbrony
trust
my
lord
clonbrony
will
do
me
justice
that
all
i
have
to
say
comprehend
the
force
of
your
last
argument
fully
sir
said
lord
colambre
i
ask
how
many
guineas
there
are
in
the
bag
i
do
ask
whether
they
are
my
father
or
not
are
to
be
your
lordship
father
sir
if
he
thinks
proper
replied
garraghty
many
i
do
know
that
i
can
justly
positively
say
five
hundred
suppose
they
would
be
my
father
if
he
signed
those
leases
i
understand
that
perfectly
and
understand
that
my
father
would
lose
three
times
that
sum
by
the
my
dear
father
you
start
but
it
is
true
is
not
this
the
rent
sir
at
which
you
were
going
to
let
garraghty
have
the
land
placing
a
paper
before
lord
clonbrony
is
the
very
thing
here
sir
written
with
my
own
hand
are
copies
of
the
proposals
i
saw
from
responsible
respectable
tenants
offered
and
is
it
so
or
is
it
not
mr
garraghty
deny
it
if
you
can
garraghty
grew
pale
his
lips
quivered
he
stammered
and
after
a
shocking
convulsion
of
face
could
at
last
articulate
only
there
was
a
great
difference
between
tenant
and
tenant
his
lordship
must
be
sensible
especially
for
so
large
a
rent
great
a
difference
as
between
agent
and
agent
i
am
sensible
especially
for
so
large
a
property
said
lord
colambre
with
cool
contempt
find
sir
i
am
well
informed
with
regard
to
this
transaction
you
will
find
also
that
i
am
equally
well
informed
with
respect
to
every
part
of
your
conduct
towards
my
father
and
his
tenantry
if
in
relating
to
him
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
i
should
make
any
mistakes
you
are
here
and
i
am
glad
you
are
to
set
me
right
and
to
do
yourself
justice
as
to
that
i
should
not
presume
to
contradict
anything
your
lordship
asserts
from
your
own
authority
where
would
be
the
use
i
leave
it
all
to
your
lordship
but
as
it
is
not
particularly
agreeable
to
stay
to
hear
one
self
abused
sir
terence
i
thank
you
to
hand
me
my
hat
and
if
you
have
the
goodness
my
lord
clonbrony
to
look
over
finally
the
accounts
before
morning
i
call
at
your
leisure
to
settle
the
balance
as
you
find
convenient
as
to
the
leases
i
quite
indifferent
so
saying
he
took
up
his
you
call
again
in
the
morning
mr
garraghty
said
sir
terence
by
that
time
i
hope
we
shall
understand
this
misunderstanding
better
sir
terence
pulled
lord
clonbrony
sleeve
let
him
go
with
the
money
it
much
wanted
him
go
said
lord
colambre
can
be
had
by
honourable
means
he
talks
as
if
he
had
the
bank
of
england
at
his
command
as
every
young
man
does
said
sir
terence
lord
colambre
deigned
no
reply
lord
clonbrony
walked
undecidedly
between
his
agent
and
his
son
looked
at
sir
terence
and
said
nothing
garraghty
departed
lord
clonbrony
called
after
him
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
shall
be
at
home
and
at
leisure
in
the
morning
sir
terence
ran
downstairs
after
him
lord
colambre
waited
quietly
for
their
return
hundred
guineas
at
a
stroke
of
a
that
was
a
neat
hit
narrowly
missed
of
honest
nick
said
lord
clonbrony
bad
too
bad
faith
i
am
much
very
much
obliged
to
you
colambre
for
that
hint
by
morning
we
shall
have
him
in
another
tune
he
must
double
the
bag
or
quit
said
sir
terence
it
if
you
please
terry
sure
three
times
five
fifteen
fifteen
hundred
down
or
he
does
not
get
my
signature
to
those
leases
for
his
brother
nor
get
the
agency
of
the
colambre
colambre
what
more
have
you
to
tell
of
him
for
since
he
is
making
out
his
accounts
against
me
it
is
no
harm
to
have
a
per
contra
against
him
that
may
ease
my
balance
fair
very
fair
said
sir
terence
lord
trust
me
for
remembering
all
the
charges
against
him
every
item
and
when
he
ca
clear
himself
if
i
do
make
him
buy
a
good
character
dear
enough
why
say
i
a
fool
and
do
know
the
value
of
character
good
or
bad
you
know
the
value
of
character
sir
terence
said
lord
colambre
know
that
it
is
not
to
be
bought
or
sold
then
turning
from
sir
terence
to
his
father
he
gave
a
full
and
true
account
of
all
he
had
seen
in
his
progress
through
his
irish
estates
and
drew
a
faithful
picture
both
of
the
bad
and
good
agent
lord
clonbrony
who
had
benevolent
feelings
and
was
fond
of
his
tenantry
was
touched
and
when
his
son
ceased
speaking
repeated
several
times
rascal
how
dare
he
use
my
tenants
so
the
in
particular
rascal
bad
heart
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
but
suddenly
recollecting
himself
he
turned
to
sir
terence
and
added
sooner
said
than
done
i
tell
you
honestly
colambre
your
friend
burke
may
be
the
best
man
in
the
world
but
he
is
the
worst
man
to
apply
to
for
a
remittance
or
a
loan
in
a
hurry
he
always
tells
me
he
ca
distress
the
tenants
he
never
at
coming
into
the
agency
even
said
sir
terence
a
good
round
sum
to
the
landlord
by
way
of
security
for
his
good
behaviour
now
honest
nick
did
that
much
for
us
at
coming
in
at
going
out
is
he
not
to
be
repaid
said
lord
colambre
the
devil
said
lord
clonbrony
that
the
very
reason
i
ca
conveniently
turn
him
out
will
make
it
convenient
to
you
sir
if
you
will
permit
me
said
lord
colambre
a
few
days
i
shall
be
of
age
and
will
join
with
you
in
raising
whatever
sum
you
want
to
free
you
from
this
man
allow
me
to
look
over
his
account
and
whatever
the
honest
balance
may
be
let
him
have
it
dear
boy
said
lord
clonbrony
a
generous
fellow
fine
irish
heart
glad
you
my
son
but
there
more
much
more
that
you
do
know
added
he
looking
at
sir
terence
who
cleared
his
throat
and
lord
clonbrony
who
was
on
the
point
of
opening
all
his
affairs
to
his
son
stopped
short
said
he
will
not
say
anything
more
of
this
at
present
for
nothing
effectual
can
be
done
till
you
are
of
age
and
then
we
shall
see
all
about
it
lord
colambre
perfectly
understood
what
his
father
meant
and
what
was
meant
by
the
clearing
of
sir
terence
throat
lord
clonbrony
wanted
his
son
to
join
him
in
opening
the
estate
to
pay
his
debts
and
sir
terence
feared
that
if
lord
colambre
were
abruptly
told
the
whole
sum
total
of
the
debts
he
would
never
be
persuaded
to
join
in
selling
or
mortgaging
so
much
of
his
patrimony
as
would
be
necessary
for
their
payment
sir
terence
thought
that
the
young
man
ignorant
probably
of
business
and
unsuspicious
of
the
state
of
his
father
affairs
might
be
brought
by
proper
management
to
any
measures
they
desired
lord
clonbrony
wavered
between
the
temptation
to
throw
himself
upon
the
generosity
of
his
son
and
the
immediate
convenience
of
borrowing
a
sum
of
money
from
his
agent
to
relieve
his
present
embarrassments
can
be
settled
repeated
he
colambre
is
of
age
so
it
does
not
signify
talking
of
it
so
sir
said
lord
colambre
my
act
in
law
may
not
be
valid
till
i
am
of
age
my
promise
as
a
man
of
honour
is
binding
now
and
i
trust
would
be
as
satisfactory
to
my
father
as
any
legal
deed
whatever
my
dear
boy
but
what
said
lord
colambre
following
his
father
eye
which
turned
to
sir
terence
as
if
asking
his
permission
to
explain
my
father
friend
sir
you
ought
permit
me
to
say
at
this
moment
to
use
your
influence
to
prevail
upon
him
to
throw
aside
all
reserve
with
a
son
whose
warmest
wish
is
to
serve
him
and
to
see
him
at
ease
and
happy
dear
boy
cried
lord
clonbrony
i
ca
stand
it
but
how
shall
i
bring
myself
to
name
the
amount
of
the
debts
some
time
or
other
i
must
know
it
said
lord
colambre
can
not
be
better
prepared
at
any
moment
than
the
present
never
more
disposed
to
give
my
assistance
to
relieve
all
difficulties
blindfold
i
can
not
be
led
to
any
purpose
sir
said
he
looking
at
sir
terence
attempt
would
be
degrading
and
futile
blindfolded
i
will
not
be
but
with
my
eyes
open
i
will
see
and
go
straight
and
prompt
as
heart
can
go
to
my
father
interest
without
a
look
or
thought
to
my
own
patrick
the
spirit
of
a
prince
and
an
irish
prince
spoke
there
cried
sir
terence
if
i
fifty
hearts
you
have
all
in
your
hand
this
minute
at
your
service
and
warm
blindfold
you
after
that
the
man
that
would
attempt
it
desarves
to
be
shot
and
i
have
no
sincerer
pleasure
in
life
than
shooting
him
this
moment
was
he
my
best
friend
but
it
not
clonbrony
or
your
father
my
lord
would
act
that
way
no
more
than
sir
terence
there
the
schedule
of
the
debts
drawing
a
paper
from
his
bosom
i
swear
to
the
lot
and
not
a
man
on
earth
could
do
that
but
myself
lord
colambre
opened
the
paper
his
father
turned
aside
covering
his
face
with
both
his
hands
man
said
sir
terence
know
him
now
better
than
you
he
will
stand
you
find
the
shock
of
that
regiment
of
figures
he
is
steel
to
the
backbone
and
proof
spirit
thank
you
my
dear
father
said
lord
colambre
trusting
me
thus
at
once
with
a
view
of
the
truth
at
first
sight
it
is
i
acknowledge
worse
than
i
expected
but
i
make
no
doubt
that
when
you
allow
me
to
examine
garraghty
accounts
and
mordicai
claims
we
shall
be
able
to
reduce
this
alarming
total
considerably
my
dear
father
you
think
we
learn
nothing
but
latin
and
greek
at
cambridge
but
you
are
mistaken
devil
a
pound
nor
a
penny
said
sir
terence
you
have
to
deal
with
a
jew
and
old
nick
and
i
not
a
match
for
them
i
do
know
who
is
and
i
have
no
hope
of
getting
any
abatement
i
looked
over
the
accounts
till
i
sick
you
will
observe
that
fifteen
hundred
guineas
have
been
saved
to
my
father
at
one
stroke
by
his
not
signing
those
leases
to
you
my
lord
not
your
father
if
you
plase
said
sir
terence
now
i
upon
the
square
with
you
i
must
be
straight
as
an
arrow
and
deal
with
you
as
the
son
and
friend
of
my
friend
before
i
was
considering
you
only
as
the
son
and
heir
which
is
quite
another
thing
you
know
accordingly
acting
for
your
father
here
i
was
making
the
best
bargain
against
you
i
could
honestly
now
i
tell
you
i
knew
the
value
of
the
lands
well
enough
we
were
as
sharp
as
garraghty
and
he
knew
it
we
were
to
have
had
the
difference
from
him
partly
in
cash
and
partly
in
balance
of
accounts
you
comprehend
and
you
only
would
have
been
the
loser
and
never
would
have
known
it
maybe
till
after
we
all
were
dead
and
buried
and
then
you
might
have
set
aside
garraghty
lease
easy
and
no
harm
done
to
any
but
a
rogue
that
desarved
it
and
in
the
meantime
an
accommodation
to
my
honest
friend
my
lord
your
father
here
but
as
fate
would
have
it
you
upset
all
by
your
progress
incognito
through
them
estates
well
it
best
as
it
is
and
i
am
better
pleased
to
be
as
we
are
trusting
all
to
a
generous
son
own
heart
now
put
the
poor
father
out
of
pain
and
tell
us
what
you
do
my
dear
one
word
then
said
lord
colambre
will
upon
two
conditions
either
join
my
father
in
levying
fines
to
enable
him
to
sell
or
mortgage
whatever
portion
of
his
estate
is
necessary
for
the
payment
of
these
debts
or
i
will
in
whatever
other
mode
he
can
point
out
as
more
agreeable
or
more
advantageous
to
him
join
in
giving
security
to
his
creditors
noble
fellow
cried
sir
terence
but
an
irishman
could
do
it
lord
clonbrony
melted
to
tears
could
not
articulate
but
held
his
arms
open
to
embrace
his
son
you
have
not
heard
my
conditions
yet
said
lord
colambre
confound
the
conditions
cried
sir
terence
conditions
could
he
ask
that
i
could
refuse
at
this
minute
said
lord
clonbrony
i
was
it
my
heart
blood
and
were
i
to
be
hanged
for
it
cried
sir
terence
what
are
the
conditions
garraghty
shall
be
dismissed
from
the
agency
welcome
and
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
the
rogue
the
tyrant
said
lord
clonbrony
to
be
beforehand
with
you
in
your
next
wish
put
burke
into
his
place
write
the
letter
for
you
to
sign
my
lord
this
minute
cried
terry
all
the
pleasure
in
life
no
it
my
lord
colambre
should
do
that
in
all
justice
what
your
next
condition
i
hope
it
no
worse
said
lord
clonbrony
you
and
my
mother
should
cease
to
be
absentees
murder
said
sir
terence
that
not
so
easy
for
there
are
two
words
to
that
bargain
lord
clonbrony
declared
that
for
his
own
part
he
was
ready
to
return
to
ireland
next
morning
and
to
promise
to
reside
on
his
estate
all
the
rest
of
his
days
that
there
was
nothing
he
desired
more
provided
lady
clonbrony
would
consent
to
it
but
that
he
could
not
promise
for
her
that
she
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
on
that
point
that
he
had
often
tried
but
that
there
was
no
moving
her
and
that
in
short
he
could
not
promise
on
her
part
but
it
was
on
this
condition
lord
colambre
said
he
must
insist
without
this
condition
was
granted
he
would
not
engage
to
do
anything
we
must
only
see
how
it
will
be
when
she
comes
to
town
she
will
come
up
from
buxton
the
day
you
of
age
to
sign
some
papers
said
lord
clonbrony
added
he
with
a
very
dejected
look
and
voice
all
to
depend
on
my
lady
clonbrony
consenting
to
return
to
ireland
i
as
far
from
all
hope
of
being
at
ease
as
ever
my
conscience
we
all
at
sea
again
said
sir
terence
lord
colambre
was
silent
but
in
his
silence
there
was
such
an
air
of
firmness
that
both
lord
clonbrony
and
sir
terence
were
convinced
entreaties
would
on
this
point
be
fruitless
lord
clonbrony
sighed
deeply
when
it
ruin
or
safety
and
her
husband
and
all
belonging
to
her
at
stake
the
woman
ca
persist
in
being
a
mule
said
sir
terence
whom
are
you
talking
said
lord
colambre
whom
oh
i
beg
your
lordship
pardon
i
thought
i
was
talking
to
my
lord
but
in
other
words
as
you
are
her
son
i
persuaded
her
ladyship
your
mother
will
prove
herself
a
reasonable
woman
when
she
sees
she
ca
help
it
so
my
lord
clonbrony
cheer
up
a
great
deal
may
be
done
by
the
fear
of
mordicai
and
an
execution
especially
now
the
prior
creditor
since
there
no
reserve
between
you
and
i
now
my
lord
colambre
said
sir
terence
must
tell
you
all
and
how
we
shambled
on
those
months
while
you
were
in
ireland
first
mordicai
went
to
law
to
prove
i
was
in
a
conspiracy
with
your
father
pretending
to
be
prior
creditor
to
keep
him
off
and
out
of
his
own
which
after
a
world
of
swearing
and
law
always
takes
time
to
do
justice
that
one
comfort
the
villain
proved
at
last
to
be
true
enough
and
so
cast
us
and
i
was
forced
to
be
paid
off
last
week
so
there
no
prior
creditor
or
any
shield
of
pretence
that
way
then
his
execution
was
coming
down
upon
us
and
nothing
to
stay
it
till
i
thought
of
a
monthly
annuity
to
mordicai
in
the
shape
of
a
wager
so
the
morning
after
he
cast
us
i
went
to
him
mordicai
says
i
you
must
be
plased
to
see
a
man
you
beaten
so
handsomely
and
though
i
sore
both
for
myself
and
my
friend
yet
you
see
i
can
laugh
still
though
an
execution
is
no
laughing
matter
and
i
sinsible
you
one
in
petto
in
your
sleeve
for
my
friend
lord
clonbrony
but
i
lay
you
a
wager
of
a
hundred
guineas
in
paper
that
a
marriage
of
his
son
with
a
certain
heiress
before
next
will
set
all
to
rights
and
pay
you
with
a
compliment
too
heavens
sir
terence
surely
you
said
no
such
thing
did
but
what
was
it
but
a
wager
which
is
nothing
but
a
dream
and
when
lost
as
i
am
as
sinsible
as
you
are
that
it
must
be
why
what
is
it
after
all
but
a
bonus
in
a
form
to
mordicai
which
i
grant
you
is
more
than
he
deserves
for
staying
the
execution
till
you
be
of
age
and
even
for
my
lady
clonbrony
sake
though
i
know
she
hates
me
like
poison
rather
than
have
her
disturbed
by
an
execution
i
pay
the
hundred
guineas
this
minute
out
of
my
own
pocket
if
i
had
em
in
it
a
thundering
knock
at
the
door
was
heard
at
this
moment
heed
it
let
thunder
said
sir
terence
it
is
they
wo
get
in
for
my
lord
bid
them
let
none
in
for
their
life
it
necessary
for
us
to
be
very
particular
about
the
now
and
i
advise
a
double
chain
for
it
and
to
have
the
footmen
well
tutored
to
look
before
they
run
to
a
double
rap
for
a
double
rap
might
be
a
double
trap
lady
and
miss
nugent
my
lord
said
a
footman
throwing
open
the
door
mother
miss
nugent
cried
lord
colambre
springing
eagerly
forward
here
said
his
mother
it
all
too
late
now
and
no
matter
where
you
are
lady
clonbrony
coldly
suffered
her
son
to
embrace
her
and
he
without
considering
the
coldness
of
her
manner
scarcely
hearing
and
not
at
all
understanding
the
words
she
said
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
cousin
who
with
a
countenance
all
radiant
with
affectionate
joy
held
out
her
hand
to
him
cousin
colambre
what
an
unexpected
pleasure
he
seized
the
hand
but
as
he
was
going
to
kiss
it
the
recollection
of
omar
crossed
his
mind
he
checked
himself
and
said
something
about
joy
and
pleasure
but
his
countenance
expressed
neither
and
miss
nugent
much
surprised
by
the
coldness
of
his
manner
withdrew
her
hand
and
turning
away
left
the
room
darling
called
lord
clonbrony
so
fast
before
you
given
me
a
word
or
a
kiss
she
came
back
and
hastily
kissed
her
uncle
who
folded
her
in
his
arms
must
i
let
you
go
and
what
makes
you
so
pale
my
dear
child
am
a
little
a
little
tired
i
will
be
with
you
again
soon
her
uncle
let
her
go
famous
buxton
baths
do
seem
to
have
agreed
with
her
by
all
i
can
see
said
lord
clonbrony
lord
the
buxton
baths
are
no
way
to
blame
but
i
know
what
is
to
blame
and
who
is
to
blame
said
lady
clonbrony
in
a
tone
of
displeasure
fixing
her
eyes
upon
her
son
you
may
well
look
confounded
colambre
but
it
is
too
late
now
you
should
have
known
your
own
mind
in
time
i
see
you
have
heard
it
then
but
i
am
sure
i
do
know
how
for
it
was
only
decided
the
day
i
left
buxton
the
news
could
hardly
travel
faster
than
i
did
pray
how
did
you
hear
it
what
said
lord
colambre
that
miss
broadhurst
is
going
to
be
married
is
that
all
said
our
hero
much
relieved
now
lord
colambre
you
reelly
are
too
much
for
my
patience
but
i
flatter
myself
you
will
feel
when
i
tell
you
that
it
is
your
friend
sir
arthur
berryl
as
i
always
prophesied
who
has
carried
off
the
prize
from
you
for
the
fear
of
displeasing
my
dear
mother
i
should
say
that
i
do
feel
sincere
pleasure
in
this
marriage
i
always
wished
it
my
friend
sir
arthur
from
the
first
moment
trusted
me
with
the
secret
of
his
attachment
he
knew
that
he
had
my
warm
good
wishes
for
his
success
he
knew
that
i
thought
most
highly
of
the
young
lady
but
that
i
never
thought
of
her
as
a
wife
for
myself
why
did
not
you
that
is
the
very
thing
i
complain
of
said
lady
clonbrony
it
is
all
over
now
you
may
set
your
heart
at
ease
for
they
are
to
be
married
on
thursday
and
poor
broadhurst
is
ready
to
break
her
heart
for
she
was
set
upon
a
coronet
for
her
daughter
and
you
ungrateful
as
you
are
you
do
know
how
she
wished
you
to
be
the
happy
man
but
only
conceive
after
all
that
had
passed
miss
broadhurst
had
the
assurance
to
expect
i
would
let
my
niece
be
her
bridesmaid
oh
i
flatly
refused
that
is
i
told
grace
it
could
not
be
and
that
there
might
be
no
affront
to
broadhurst
who
did
not
deserve
it
i
pretended
grace
had
never
mentioned
it
but
ordered
my
carriage
and
left
buxton
directly
grace
was
hurt
for
she
is
very
warm
in
her
friendships
i
am
sorry
to
hurt
grace
but
reelly
i
could
not
let
her
be
bridesmaid
and
that
if
you
must
know
is
what
vexed
her
and
made
the
tears
come
in
her
eyes
i
suppose
and
i
sorry
for
it
but
one
must
keep
up
one
dignity
a
little
after
all
miss
broadhurst
was
only
a
citizen
and
reelly
now
a
very
odd
girl
never
did
anything
like
anybody
else
settled
her
marriage
at
last
in
the
oddest
way
grace
can
you
tell
the
particulars
i
own
i
am
tired
of
the
subject
and
tired
of
my
journey
my
lord
i
shall
take
leave
to
dine
in
my
own
room
continued
her
ladyship
as
she
quitted
the
room
hope
her
ladyship
did
not
notice
me
said
sir
terence
coming
from
behind
a
terry
what
did
you
hide
for
said
lord
clonbrony
i
did
hide
nor
would
from
any
man
living
let
alone
any
woman
leaving
any
woman
out
of
the
question
hide
no
but
i
just
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
behind
this
curtain
that
my
poor
lady
clonbrony
might
not
be
discomfited
and
shocked
by
the
sight
of
one
whom
she
ca
abide
the
very
minute
she
come
home
oh
i
some
consideration
it
would
have
put
her
out
of
humour
worse
with
both
of
you
too
and
for
that
there
no
need
as
far
as
i
see
so
i
take
myself
off
to
my
to
dine
and
maybe
you
may
get
her
down
and
into
spirits
again
but
for
your
lives
do
touch
upon
ireland
the
night
nor
till
she
has
fairly
got
the
better
of
the
marriage
apropos
there
my
wager
to
mordicai
gone
at
a
slap
it
i
that
ought
to
be
scolding
you
my
lord
colambre
but
i
trust
you
will
do
as
well
yet
not
in
point
of
purse
maybe
but
i
not
one
of
those
that
think
that
money
everything
though
i
grant
you
in
this
world
there
nothing
to
be
had
without
it
love
excepted
which
most
people
do
believe
in
but
not
i
in
particular
cases
so
i
leave
you
with
my
blessing
and
i
a
notion
at
this
time
that
is
better
than
my
company
your
most
devoted
the
sir
terence
would
not
be
persuaded
by
lord
clonbrony
to
stay
nodding
at
lord
colambre
as
he
went
out
of
the
room
he
said
an
eye
in
going
to
your
heart
ease
too
when
i
played
myself
i
never
liked
sir
terence
was
not
deficient
in
penetration
but
he
never
could
help
boasting
of
his
discoveries
lord
colambre
was
grateful
for
his
judicious
departure
and
followed
his
equally
judicious
advice
not
to
touch
upon
ireland
this
night
lady
clonbrony
was
full
of
buxton
and
he
was
glad
to
be
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
talking
and
he
indulged
himself
in
considering
what
might
be
passing
in
miss
nugent
mind
she
now
appeared
in
remarkably
good
spirits
for
her
aunt
had
given
her
a
hint
that
she
thought
her
out
of
humour
because
she
had
not
been
permitted
to
be
miss
broadhurst
bridesmaid
and
she
was
determined
to
exert
herself
to
dispel
this
notion
this
it
was
now
easy
for
her
to
do
because
she
had
by
this
time
in
her
own
imagination
found
a
plausible
excuse
for
that
coldness
in
lord
colambre
reception
of
her
by
which
she
had
at
first
been
hurt
she
had
settled
it
that
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
she
was
of
his
mother
sentiments
respecting
miss
broadhurst
marriage
and
that
this
idea
and
perhaps
the
apprehension
of
her
reproaches
had
caused
his
embarrassment
she
knew
that
she
could
easily
set
this
misunderstanding
right
accordingly
when
lady
clonbrony
had
talked
herself
to
sleep
about
buxton
and
was
taking
her
afternoon
nap
as
it
was
her
custom
to
do
when
she
had
neither
cards
nor
company
to
keep
her
awake
miss
nugent
began
to
explain
her
own
sentiments
and
to
give
lord
colambre
as
her
aunt
had
desired
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
miss
broadhurst
marriage
had
been
settled
the
first
place
said
she
me
assure
you
that
i
rejoice
in
this
marriage
i
think
your
friend
sir
arthur
berryl
is
every
way
deserving
of
my
friend
miss
broadhurst
and
this
from
me
said
she
smiling
no
slight
eulogium
i
have
marked
the
rise
and
progress
of
their
attachment
and
it
has
been
founded
on
the
perception
of
such
excellent
qualities
on
each
side
that
i
have
no
fear
for
its
permanence
sir
arthur
berryl
honourable
conduct
in
paying
his
father
debts
and
his
generosity
to
his
mother
and
sisters
whose
fortunes
were
left
entirely
dependent
upon
him
first
pleased
my
friend
it
was
like
what
she
would
have
done
herself
and
like
in
short
it
is
what
few
young
men
as
she
said
of
the
present
day
would
do
then
his
refraining
from
all
personal
expenses
his
going
without
equipage
and
without
horses
that
he
might
do
what
he
felt
to
be
right
whilst
it
exposed
him
continually
to
the
ridicule
of
fashionable
young
men
or
to
the
charge
of
avarice
made
a
very
different
impression
on
miss
broadhurst
mind
her
esteem
and
admiration
were
excited
by
these
proofs
of
strength
of
character
and
of
just
and
good
principles
you
go
on
you
will
make
me
envious
and
jealous
of
my
friend
said
lord
colambre
jealous
oh
it
is
too
late
now
besides
you
can
not
be
jealous
for
you
never
loved
never
loved
miss
broadhurst
i
acknowledge
was
the
advantage
sir
arthur
berryl
had
over
you
he
loved
and
my
friend
saw
it
was
said
lord
colambre
was
repeated
miss
nugent
if
you
mean
that
she
was
vain
and
apt
to
fancy
people
in
love
with
her
i
can
assure
you
that
you
are
mistaken
never
was
woman
young
or
old
more
to
the
views
of
those
by
whom
she
was
addressed
no
flattery
no
fashion
could
blind
her
judgment
knew
how
to
choose
a
friend
well
i
am
sure
said
lord
colambre
a
friend
for
life
too
i
am
sure
you
will
allow
and
she
had
such
numbers
such
strange
variety
of
admirers
as
might
have
puzzled
the
choice
and
turned
the
brain
of
any
inferior
person
such
a
succession
of
lovers
as
she
has
had
this
summer
ever
since
you
went
to
ireland
they
appeared
and
vanished
like
figures
in
a
she
had
three
noble
admirers
rank
in
three
different
forms
offered
themselves
first
came
in
hobbling
rank
and
gout
next
rank
and
gaming
then
rank
very
high
rank
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
all
of
these
were
rejected
and
as
they
moved
off
i
thought
broadhurst
would
have
broken
her
heart
next
came
fashion
with
his
head
heart
and
soul
in
his
cravat
he
quickly
made
his
bow
or
rather
his
nod
and
walked
off
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
then
came
a
man
of
gallantry
but
whispered
miss
nugent
was
a
mistress
in
the
wood
and
my
friend
could
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
gentleman
if
she
liked
the
man
interrupted
lord
clonbrony
i
suppose
she
did
for
all
women
but
yourself
grace
like
men
of
gallantry
miss
broadhurst
was
a
goose
for
refusing
him
on
account
of
the
mistress
because
she
might
have
been
bought
up
and
settled
with
a
few
thousand
pounds
that
as
it
may
said
miss
nugent
friend
did
not
like
and
would
not
accept
of
the
man
of
gallantry
so
he
retired
and
comforted
himself
with
a
copy
of
verses
then
came
a
man
of
wit
but
still
it
was
wit
without
worth
and
presently
came
worth
without
wit
she
preferred
wit
and
worth
united
which
she
fortunately
at
last
found
lord
colambre
in
your
friend
sir
arthur
berryl
my
girl
said
her
uncle
glad
to
see
you
got
up
your
spirits
again
though
you
were
not
to
be
bridesmaid
well
i
hope
you
be
bride
soon
i
sure
you
ought
to
be
and
you
should
think
of
rewarding
that
poor
salisbury
who
plagues
me
to
death
whenever
he
can
catch
hold
of
me
about
you
he
must
have
our
definitive
at
last
you
know
grace
a
silence
ensued
which
neither
miss
nugent
nor
lord
colambre
seemed
willing
or
able
to
break
very
good
company
faith
you
three
one
of
ye
asleep
and
the
other
two
saying
nothing
to
keep
one
awake
colambre
have
you
no
dublin
news
grace
have
you
no
buxton
scandal
what
was
it
lady
clonbrony
told
us
you
tell
us
about
the
oddness
of
miss
broadhurst
settling
her
marriage
tell
me
that
for
i
love
to
hear
odd
things
you
will
not
think
it
odd
said
she
evening
but
i
should
begin
by
telling
you
that
three
of
her
admirers
beside
sir
arthur
berryl
had
followed
her
to
buxton
and
had
been
paying
their
court
to
her
all
the
time
we
were
there
and
at
last
grew
impatient
for
her
decision
for
her
definitive
said
lord
clonbrony
miss
nugent
was
put
out
again
but
resumed
one
evening
just
before
the
dancing
began
the
gentlemen
were
all
standing
round
miss
broadhurst
one
of
them
said
i
wish
miss
broadhurst
would
decide
that
whoever
she
dances
with
should
be
her
partner
for
life
what
a
happy
man
he
would
be
but
how
can
i
decide
said
miss
broadhurst
i
wish
i
had
a
friend
to
plead
for
me
said
one
of
the
suitors
looking
at
me
have
you
no
friend
of
your
own
said
miss
broadhurst
plenty
of
friends
said
the
gentleman
plenty
then
you
must
be
a
very
happy
man
replied
miss
broadhurst
come
said
she
laughing
i
will
dance
with
that
man
who
can
convince
me
that
he
has
near
relations
excepted
one
true
friend
in
the
world
that
man
who
has
made
the
best
friend
i
dare
say
will
make
the
best
husband
that
moment
continued
miss
nugent
was
certain
who
would
be
her
choice
the
gentlemen
all
declared
at
first
that
they
had
abundance
of
excellent
friends
the
best
friends
in
the
world
but
when
miss
broadhurst
them
as
to
what
their
friends
had
done
for
them
or
what
they
were
willing
to
do
modern
friendship
dwindled
into
a
ridiculously
small
compass
i
can
not
give
you
the
particulars
of
the
though
it
was
conducted
with
great
spirit
and
humour
by
miss
broadhurst
but
i
can
tell
you
the
result
that
sir
arthur
berryl
by
incontrovertible
facts
and
eloquence
warm
from
the
heart
convinced
everybody
present
that
he
had
the
best
friend
in
the
world
and
miss
broadhurst
as
he
finished
speaking
gave
him
her
hand
and
he
led
her
off
in
triumph
so
you
see
lord
colambre
you
were
at
last
the
cause
of
my
friend
marriage
she
turned
to
lord
colambre
as
she
spoke
these
words
with
such
an
affectionate
smile
and
such
an
expression
of
open
inmost
tenderness
in
her
whole
countenance
that
our
hero
could
hardly
resist
the
impulse
of
his
passion
could
hardly
restrain
himself
from
falling
at
her
feet
that
instant
and
declaring
his
love
omar
st
omar
it
must
not
be
must
be
gone
said
lord
clonbrony
pulling
out
his
watch
is
time
to
go
to
my
club
and
poor
terry
will
wonder
what
has
become
of
me
lord
colambre
instantly
offered
to
accompany
his
father
much
to
lord
clonbrony
and
more
to
miss
nugent
surprise
said
she
to
herself
so
long
an
absence
leave
me
leave
his
mother
with
whom
he
always
used
to
stay
on
purpose
to
avoid
me
what
can
i
have
done
to
displease
him
it
is
clear
it
was
not
about
miss
broadhurst
marriage
he
was
offended
for
he
looked
pleased
and
like
himself
whilst
i
was
talking
of
that
but
the
moment
afterwards
what
a
constrained
unintelligible
expression
of
countenance
and
leaves
me
to
go
to
a
club
which
he
detests
as
the
gentlemen
shut
the
door
on
leaving
the
room
lady
clonbrony
wakened
and
starting
up
exclaimed
the
matter
are
they
gone
is
colambre
gone
with
my
uncle
odd
very
odd
of
him
to
go
and
leave
me
he
always
used
to
stay
with
me
what
did
he
say
about
me
then
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
him
or
about
anything
indeed
for
i
excessively
tired
and
stupid
alone
in
london
as
bad
as
anywhere
else
ring
the
bell
and
we
go
to
bed
directly
if
you
have
no
objection
grace
grace
made
no
objection
lady
clonbrony
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
in
ten
minutes
miss
nugent
went
to
bed
but
she
lay
awake
considering
what
could
be
the
cause
of
her
cousin
colambre
hard
unkindness
and
of
altered
eye
she
was
openness
itself
and
she
determined
that
the
first
moment
she
could
speak
to
him
alone
she
would
at
once
ask
for
an
explanation
with
this
resolution
she
rose
in
the
morning
and
went
down
to
the
in
hopes
of
meeting
him
as
it
had
formerly
been
his
custom
to
be
early
and
she
expected
to
find
him
reading
in
his
usual
place
chapter
xiv
no
lord
colambre
was
not
in
his
accustomed
place
reading
in
the
nor
did
he
make
his
appearance
till
both
his
father
and
mother
had
been
some
time
at
breakfast
morning
to
you
my
lord
colambre
said
his
mother
in
a
reproachful
tone
the
moment
he
entered
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
company
last
night
morning
to
you
colambre
said
his
father
in
a
more
jocose
tone
of
reproach
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
good
company
last
night
morning
to
you
lord
colambre
said
miss
nugent
and
though
she
endeavoured
to
throw
all
reproach
from
her
looks
and
to
let
none
be
heard
in
her
voice
yet
there
was
a
slight
tremulous
motion
in
that
voice
which
struck
our
hero
to
the
heart
thank
you
for
missing
me
said
he
addressing
himself
to
his
mother
stayed
away
but
half
an
hour
i
accompanied
my
father
to
james
street
and
when
i
returned
i
found
that
every
one
had
retired
to
rest
was
that
the
case
said
lady
clonbrony
own
i
thought
it
very
unlike
you
to
leave
me
in
that
sort
of
way
lest
you
should
be
jealous
of
that
when
he
was
accompanying
me
said
lord
clonbrony
must
remark
that
though
i
had
his
body
with
me
i
had
none
of
his
mind
that
he
left
at
home
with
you
ladies
or
with
some
fair
one
across
the
water
for
the
deuce
of
two
words
did
he
bestow
upon
me
with
all
his
pretence
of
accompanying
me
colambre
seems
to
have
a
fair
chance
of
a
pleasant
breakfast
said
miss
nugent
smiling
on
all
sides
have
heard
none
on
your
side
grace
said
lord
clonbrony
that
the
reason
i
suppose
he
wisely
takes
his
seat
beside
you
but
come
we
will
not
badger
you
any
more
my
dear
boy
we
have
given
him
as
fine
a
complexion
amongst
us
as
if
he
had
been
out
hunting
these
three
hours
have
not
we
grace
colambre
has
been
a
season
or
two
more
in
he
not
be
so
easily
put
out
of
countenance
said
lady
clonbrony
do
see
young
men
of
fashion
here
blushing
about
nothing
nor
about
anything
my
dear
said
lord
clonbrony
that
no
proof
they
do
nothing
they
ought
to
blush
for
they
do
there
no
occasion
for
ladies
to
inquire
said
lady
clonbrony
this
i
know
that
it
a
great
disadvantage
to
a
young
man
of
a
certain
rank
to
blush
for
no
people
who
live
in
a
certain
set
ever
do
and
it
is
the
most
opposite
thing
possible
to
a
certain
air
which
i
own
i
think
colambre
wants
and
now
that
he
has
done
travelling
in
ireland
which
is
no
use
in
pint
of
giving
a
gentleman
a
travelled
air
or
anything
of
that
sort
i
hope
he
will
put
himself
under
my
conduct
for
next
winter
campaign
in
town
lord
clonbrony
looked
as
if
he
did
not
know
how
to
look
and
after
drumming
on
the
table
for
some
seconds
said
i
told
you
how
it
would
be
that
a
fatal
hard
condition
of
yours
a
hard
condition
i
hope
my
dear
father
said
lord
colambre
it
must
be
since
it
ca
be
fulfilled
or
wo
be
fulfilled
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
replied
lord
clonbrony
sighing
am
persuaded
sir
that
it
will
be
fulfilled
said
lord
colambre
am
persuaded
that
when
my
mother
hears
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
when
she
finds
that
your
happiness
and
the
happiness
of
her
whole
family
depend
upon
her
yielding
her
taste
on
one
subject
i
see
now
what
you
are
about
cried
lady
clonbrony
are
coming
round
with
your
persuasions
and
prefaces
to
ask
me
to
give
up
and
go
back
with
you
to
ireland
my
lord
you
may
save
yourselves
the
trouble
all
of
you
for
no
earthly
persuasions
shall
make
me
do
it
i
will
never
give
up
my
taste
on
that
pint
my
happiness
has
a
right
to
be
as
much
considered
as
your
father
colambre
or
anybody
and
in
one
word
i
wo
do
it
cried
she
rising
angrily
from
the
did
not
i
tell
you
how
it
would
be
cried
lord
clonbrony
mother
has
not
heard
me
yet
said
lord
colambre
laying
his
hand
upon
his
mother
arm
as
she
attempted
to
pass
me
madam
for
your
own
sake
you
do
not
know
what
will
happen
this
very
day
this
very
hour
perhaps
if
you
do
not
listen
to
me
what
will
happen
said
lady
clonbrony
stopping
short
indeed
she
little
knows
said
lord
clonbrony
hanging
over
her
head
over
my
head
said
lady
clonbrony
looking
up
what
an
execution
madam
said
lord
colambre
me
an
execution
said
lady
clonbrony
sitting
down
again
i
heard
you
talk
of
an
execution
months
ago
my
lord
before
my
son
went
to
ireland
and
it
blew
over
i
heard
no
more
of
it
wo

over

said
lord
clonbrony

more
of
it
now
sir
terence
it
was
you
may
remember
that
settled
it
then
and
ca

for
him
since
he
understands
these
cases
and
i
will
ask
him
to
dinner
myself
for
your
sake
and
be
very
civil
to
him
my
lord
your
civility
either
for
my
sake
or
your
own
will
not
signify
a
straw
my
dear
in
this
case
anything
that
poor
terry
could
do
he
do
and
welcome
without
it
but
he
can
do
nothing
that
very
extraordinary
but
i
clear
no
one
dare
to
bring
a
real
execution
against
us
in
earnest
and
you
are
only
trying
to
frighten
me
to
your
purpose
like
a
child
but
it
sha
do
well
my
dear
you
see
too
late
a
knock
at
the
house
door
is
it
what
is
it
cried
lord
clonbrony
growing
very
pale
lord
colambre
changed
colour
too
and
ran
downstairs
let
let
anybody
in
for
your
life
colambre
under
any
pretence
cried
lord
clonbrony
calling
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
then
running
to
the
window
all
that
good
it
mordicai
himself
and
the
people
with
him
your
head
on
me
my
dear
aunt
said
miss
nugent
lady
clonbrony
leant
back
trembling
and
ready
to
faint
he
walking
off
now
the
rascal
could
not
get
in
safe
for
the
present
cried
lord
clonbrony
rubbing
his
hands
and
repeating
for
the
present
for
the
present
repeated
lord
colambre
coming
again
into
the
room
for
the
present
hour
could
not
get
in
i
suppose
oh
i
warned
all
the
servants
well
said
lord
clonbrony
and
so
did
terry
ay
there
the
rascal
mordicai
walking
off
at
the
end
of
the
street
i
know
his
walk
a
mile
off
gad
i
can
breathe
again
i
am
glad
he
gone
but
he
will
come
back
and
always
lie
in
wait
and
some
time
or
other
when
we
off
our
guard
unawares
he
slide
in
slide
in
oh
horrid
cried
lady
clonbrony
sitting
up
and
wiping
away
the
water
which
miss
nugent
had
sprinkled
on
her
face
you
much
alarmed
said
lord
colambre
with
a
voice
of
tenderness
looking
at
his
mother
first
but
his
eyes
fixing
on
miss
nugent
said
lady
clonbrony
never
thought
it
would
reelly
come
to
this
will
really
come
to
much
more
my
dear
said
lord
clonbrony
you
may
depend
upon
unless
you
prevent
it
what
can
i
do
i
know
nothing
of
business
how
should
i
lord
clonbrony
but
i
know
there
colambre
i
was
always
told
that
when
he
was
of
age
everything
should
be
settled
and
why
ca
he
settle
it
when
he
upon
the
spot
upon
one
condition
i
will
cried
lord
colambre
what
loss
to
myself
my
dear
mother
i
need
not
mention
i
will
mention
it
cried
lord
clonbrony
the
loss
it
will
be
of
nearly
half
the
estate
he
would
have
had
if
we
had
not
spent
it
oh
i
am
excessively
sorry
my
son
to
be
at
such
a
loss
it
must
not
be
can
not
be
otherwise
said
lord
clonbrony
it
ca
be
this
way
either
my
lady
clonbrony
unless
you
comply
with
his
condition
and
consent
to
return
to
ireland
can
not
i
will
not
replied
lady
clonbrony
this
your
condition
colambre
i
take
it
exceedingly
ill
of
you
i
think
it
very
unkind
and
unhandsome
and
ungenerous
and
undutiful
of
you
colambre
you
my
son
she
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
reproaches
then
came
to
entreaties
and
tears
but
our
hero
prepared
for
this
had
steeled
his
mind
and
he
stood
resolved
not
to
indulge
his
own
feelings
or
to
yield
to
caprice
or
persuasion
but
to
do
that
which
he
knew
was
best
for
the
happiness
of
hundreds
of
tenants
who
depended
upon
them
best
for
both
his
father
and
his
mother
ultimate
happiness
and
respectability
all
in
vain
cried
lord
clonbrony
have
no
resource
but
one
and
i
must
condescend
now
to
go
to
him
this
minute
for
mordicai
will
be
back
and
seize
all
i
must
sign
and
leave
all
to
garraghty
sign
sign
my
lord
and
settle
with
colambre
i
heard
all
the
complaints
you
brought
over
against
that
man
my
lord
spent
half
the
night
telling
them
to
me
but
all
agents
are
bad
i
suppose
at
any
rate
i
ca
help
it
sign
sign
my
lord
he
has
money
yes
do
go
and
settle
with
him
my
lord
lord
colambre
and
miss
nugent
at
one
and
the
same
moment
stopped
lord
clonbrony
as
he
was
quitting
the
room
and
then
approached
lady
clonbrony
with
supplicating
looks
but
she
turned
her
head
to
the
other
side
and
as
if
putting
away
their
entreaties
made
a
repelling
motion
with
both
her
hands
and
exclaimed
grace
nugent
no
colambre
no
no
colambre
i
never
hear
of
leaving
there
no
living
out
of
i
ca
i
wo
live
out
of
i
say
her
son
saw
that
the
londonomania
was
now
stronger
than
ever
upon
her
but
resolved
to
make
one
desperate
appeal
to
her
natural
feelings
which
though
smothered
he
could
not
believe
were
wholly
extinguished
he
caught
her
repelling
hands
and
pressing
them
with
respectful
tenderness
to
his
lips
my
dear
mother
you
once
loved
your
son
said
he
him
better
than
anything
in
this
world
if
one
spark
of
affection
for
him
remains
hear
him
now
and
forgive
him
if
he
pass
the
bounds
bounds
he
never
passed
before
of
filial
duty
mother
in
compliance
with
your
wishes
my
father
left
ireland
left
his
home
his
duties
his
friends
his
natural
connexions
and
for
many
years
he
has
lived
in
england
and
you
have
spent
many
seasons
in
london
in
the
very
best
company
in
the
very
first
circles
said
lady
clonbrony
as
the
english
are
said
to
be
in
general
to
strangers
replied
lord
colambre
very
best
company
if
you
mean
the
most
fashionable
have
accepted
of
our
entertainments
we
have
forced
our
way
into
their
frozen
circles
we
have
been
permitted
to
breathe
in
these
elevated
regions
of
fashion
we
have
it
to
say
that
the
duke
of
this
and
my
lady
that
are
of
our
acquaintance
we
may
say
more
we
may
boast
that
we
have
vied
with
those
whom
we
could
never
equal
and
at
what
expense
have
we
done
all
this
for
a
single
season
the
last
winter
i
will
go
no
farther
at
the
expense
of
a
great
part
of
your
timber
the
growth
of
a
century
swallowed
in
the
entertainments
of
one
winter
in
london
our
hills
to
be
bare
for
another
half
century
to
come
but
let
the
trees
go
i
think
more
of
your
tenants
of
those
left
under
the
tyranny
of
a
bad
agent
at
the
expense
of
every
comfort
every
hope
they
enjoyed
tenants
who
were
thriving
and
prosperous
who
used
to
smile
upon
you
and
to
bless
you
both
in
one
cottage
i
have
seen
here
lord
clonbrony
unable
to
restrain
his
emotion
hurried
out
of
the
room
i
am
sure
it
is
not
my
fault
said
lady
clonbrony
i
brought
my
lord
a
large
fortune
and
i
am
confident
i
have
not
after
all
spent
more
any
season
in
the
best
company
than
he
has
among
a
set
of
low
people
in
his
muddling
discreditable
way
how
has
he
been
reduced
to
this
said
lord
colambre
he
not
formerly
live
with
gentlemen
his
equals
in
his
own
country
his
contemporaries
men
of
the
first
station
and
character
whom
i
met
in
dublin
spoke
of
him
in
a
manner
that
gratified
the
heart
of
his
son
he
was
respectable
and
respected
at
his
own
home
but
when
he
was
forced
away
from
that
home
deprived
of
his
objects
his
occupations
induced
him
to
live
in
london
or
at
where
he
could
find
no

down
late
in
life
in
the
midst
of
strangers

and
reserved
himself
too
proud
to
bend
to
those
who
disdained
him

an
irishman

he
not
more
to
be
pitied
than
blamed
for
yes

his
son
must
say
the
word
the
degradation
which
has
ensued

this

him

that
he
is
capable

to

that
you
grant
our
request
she
kneeled
beside
lord
colambre
as
she
spoke
it
possible
to
resist
that
voice
that
look
thought
lord
colambre
anybody
knew
said
lady
clonbrony
anybody
could
conceive
how
i
detest
the
sight
the
thoughts
of
that
old
yellow
damask
furniture
in
the
at
clonbrony
castle
heavens
cried
lord
colambre
starting
up
and
looking
at
his
mother
in
stupefied
astonishment
that
what
you
are
thinking
of
yellow
damask
furniture
said
her
niece
smiling
oh
if
that
all
that
shall
never
offend
your
eyes
again
aunt
my
painted
velvet
chairs
are
finished
and
trust
the
furnishing
that
room
to
me
the
legacy
lately
left
me
can
not
be
better
applied
you
shall
see
how
beautifully
it
will
be
furnished
if
i
had
money
i
should
like
to
do
it
myself
but
it
would
take
an
immensity
to
new
furnish
clonbrony
castle
properly
furniture
in
this
house
said
miss
nugent
looking
round
do
a
great
deal
towards
it
i
declare
cried
lady
clonbrony
never
struck
me
before
grace
i
protest
and
what
would
not
suit
one
might
sell
or
exchange
here
and
it
would
be
a
great
amusement
to
me
and
i
should
like
to
set
the
fashion
of
something
better
in
that
country
and
i
declare
now
i
should
like
to
see
those
poor
people
and
that
widow
i
do
assure
you
i
think
i
was
happier
at
home
only
that
one
gets
i
do
know
how
a
notion
one
nobody
out
of
but
after
all
there
many
drawbacks
in
and
many
people
are
very
impertinent
i
allow
and
if
there
a
woman
in
the
world
i
hate
it
is
dareville
and
if
i
was
leaving
i
should
not
regret
lady
langdale
neither
and
lady
james
is
as
cold
as
a
stone
colambre
may
well
say
frozen
circles
these
sort
of
people
are
really
very
cold
and
have
i
do
believe
no
hearts
i
do
verily
think
there
is
one
of
them
would
regret
me
more
hey
let
me
see
dublin
the
winter
merrion
square
new
furnished
and
the
summer
clonbrony
castle
lord
colambre
and
miss
nugent
waited
in
silence
till
her
mind
should
have
worked
itself
clear
one
great
obstacle
had
been
removed
and
now
that
the
yellow
damask
had
been
taken
out
of
her
imagination
they
no
longer
despaired
lord
clonbrony
put
his
head
into
the
room
hopes
any
if
not
let
me
go
he
saw
the
doubting
expression
of
lady
clonbrony
countenance
hope
in
the
face
of
his
son
and
niece
dear
dear
lady
clonbrony
make
us
all
happy
by
one
word
said
he
kissing
her
never
kissed
me
so
since
we
left
ireland
before
said
lady
clonbrony
since
it
must
be
so
let
us
go
said
she
i
ever
see
such
joy
said
lord
clonbrony
clasping
his
hands
never
expected
such
joy
in
my
life
i
must
go
and
tell
poor
terry
and
off
he
ran
now
since
we
are
to
go
said
lady
clonbrony
let
us
go
immediately
before
the
thing
gets
wind
else
i
shall
have
dareville
and
lady
langdale
and
lady
james
and
all
the
world
coming
to
condole
with
me
just
to
satisfy
their
own
curiosity
and
then
miss
pratt
who
hears
everything
that
everybody
says
and
more
than
they
say
will
come
and
tell
me
how
it
is
reported
everywhere
that
we
are
ruined
i
never
could
bear
to
stay
and
hear
all
this
i
tell
you
what
i
do
you
are
to
be
of
age
the
day
after
colambre
very
well
there
are
some
papers
for
me
to
sign
i
must
stay
to
put
my
name
to
them
and
that
done
that
minute
i
leave
you
and
lord
clonbrony
to
settle
all
the
rest
and
i
get
into
my
carriage
with
grace
and
go
down
to
buxton
again
where
you
can
come
for
me
and
take
me
up
when
you
all
ready
to
go
to
ireland
and
we
shall
be
so
far
on
our
way
colambre
what
do
you
say
to
this
if
you
like
it
madam
said
he
giving
one
hasty
glance
at
miss
nugent
and
withdrawing
his
eyes
is
the
best
possible
arrangement
thought
grace
is
the
best
possible
arrangement
which
takes
us
away
i
like
it
said
lady
clonbrony
be
sure
i
do
or
i
should
not
propose
it
what
is
colambre
thinking
of
i
know
grace
at
all
events
what
you
and
i
must
think
of
of
having
the
furniture
packed
up
and
settling
what
to
go
and
what
to
be
exchanged
and
all
that
now
my
dear
go
and
write
a
note
directly
to
soho
and
bid
him
come
himself
immediately
and
we
go
and
make
out
a
catalogue
this
instant
of
what
furniture
i
will
have
packed
so
with
her
head
full
of
furniture
lady
clonbrony
retired
go
to
my
business
colambre
and
i
leave
you
to
settle
yours
in
peace
in
peace
never
was
our
hero
mind
less
at
peace
than
at
this
moment
the
more
his
heart
felt
that
it
was
painful
the
more
his
reason
told
him
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
part
from
grace
nugent
to
his
union
with
her
there
was
an
obstacle
which
his
prudence
told
him
ought
to
be
insurmountable
yet
he
felt
that
during
the
few
days
he
had
been
with
her
the
few
hours
he
had
been
near
her
he
had
with
his
utmost
power
over
himself
scarcely
been
master
of
his
passion
or
capable
of
concealing
it
from
its
object
it
could
not
have
been
done
but
for
her
perfect
simplicity
and
innocence
but
how
could
this
be
supposed
on
his
part
how
could
he
venture
to
live
with
this
charming
girl
how
could
he
settle
at
home
what
resource
his
mind
turned
towards
the
army
he
thought
that
abroad
and
in
active
life
he
should
lose
all
the
painful
recollections
and
drive
from
his
heart
all
the
resentments
which
could
now
be
only
a
source
of
unavailing
regret
but
his
mother
his
mother
who
had
now
yielded
her
own
taste
to
his
entreaties
for
the
good
of
her
family
she
expected
him
to
return
and
live
with
her
in
ireland
though
not
actually
promised
or
specified
he
knew
that
she
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
upon
this
hope
this
faith
she
consented
he
knew
that
she
would
be
shocked
at
the
bare
idea
of
his
going
into
the
army
there
was
one
chance
our
hero
tried
at
this
moment
to
think
it
the
best
possible
chance
that
miss
nugent
might
marry
salisbury
and
settle
in
england
on
this
idea
he
relied
as
the
only
means
of
extricating
him
from
difficulties
it
was
necessary
to
turn
his
thoughts
immediately
to
business
to
execute
his
promises
to
his
father
two
great
objects
were
now
to
be
accomplished
the
payment
of
his
father
debts
and
the
settlement
of
the
irish
agent
accounts
and
in
transacting
this
complicated
business
he
derived
considerable
assistance
from
sir
terence
and
from
sir
arthur
berryl
solicitor
edwards
whilst
acting
for
sir
arthur
on
a
former
occasion
lord
colambre
had
gained
the
entire
confidence
of
this
solicitor
who
was
a
man
of
the
first
eminence
edwards
took
the
papers
and
lord
clonbrony
home
with
him
saying
that
he
would
give
an
answer
the
next
morning
he
then
waited
upon
lord
colambre
and
informed
him
that
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
sir
arthur
berryl
who
with
the
consent
and
desire
of
his
lady
requested
that
whatever
money
might
be
required
by
lord
clonbrony
should
be
immediately
supplied
on
their
account
without
waiting
till
lord
colambre
should
be
of
age
as
the
ready
money
might
be
of
same
convenience
to
him
in
accelerating
the
journey
to
ireland
which
sir
arthur
and
lady
berryl
knew
was
his
lordship
object
sir
terence
now
supplied
edwards
with
accurate
information
as
to
the
demands
that
were
made
upon
lord
clonbrony
and
of
the
respective
characters
of
the
creditors
edwards
undertook
to
settle
with
the
fair
claimants
sir
terence
with
the
rogues
so
that
by
the
advancement
of
ready
money
from
the
berryls
and
by
the
detection
of
false
and
exaggerated
charges
which
sir
terence
made
among
the
inferior
class
the
debts
were
reduced
nearly
to
one
half
of
their
former
amount
mordicai
who
had
been
foiled
in
his
vile
attempt
to
become
sole
creditor
had
however
a
demand
of
more
than
seven
thousand
pounds
upon
lord
clonbrony
which
he
had
raised
to
this
enormous
sum
in
six
or
seven
years
by
means
well
known
to
himself
he
stood
the
foremost
in
the
list
not
from
the
greatness
of
the
sum
but
from
the
danger
of
his
adding
to
it
the
expenses
of
law
sir
terence
undertook
to
pay
the
whole
with
five
thousand
pounds
lord
clonbrony
thought
it
impossible
the
solicitor
thought
it
improvident
because
he
knew
that
upon
a
trial
a
much
greater
abatement
would
be
allowed
but
lord
colambre
was
determined
from
the
present
embarrassments
of
his
own
situation
to
leave
nothing
undone
that
could
be
accomplished
immediately
sir
terence
pleased
with
his
commission
immediately
went
to
mordicai
sir
terence
said
mordicai
hope
you
are
come
to
pay
me
my
hundred
guineas

from
my
lord
colambre
said
mordicai
that
he

of
age
these
three
days
matter
for
that
he
has
sent
me
to
look
over
your
account
and
to
hope
that
you
will
make
some
small
abatement
in
the
total
sir
terence

think

clever
in
things
of
this
sort
but

behind

will
take
five
thousand
down
and

discharge

demand

if
you
have
that
money

if
not
i
know
how
to
get
it
and
along
with
it
complete
revenge
for
all
the
insults
i
have
received
from
that
greenhorn
his
son
brady
cried
sir
terence
you

that

that
word

you
to
witness

a
rebellion

it
was

bundle
to
you

the
edwards

mordicai
how

of
your
clutches
and
we
have
enough
to

with
our
money

i
must
allow
you

a
very
wheedling
way
here
thompson
make
out
a
receipt
for
lord
clonbrony
i
never
go
to
law
with
an
old
customer
if
i
can
help
it
this
business
settled
soho
was
next
to
be
dealt
with
he
came
at
lady
clonbrony
summons
and
was
taking
directions
with
the
utmost
sang
froid
for
packing
up
and
sending
off
the
very
furniture
for
which
he
was
not
paid
lord
colambre
called
him
into
his
father
study
and
producing
his
bill
he
began
to
point
out
various
articles
which
were
charged
at
prices
that
were
obviously
extravagant
really
my
lord
they
are
abundantly
extravagant
if
i
charged
vulgar
prices
i
should
be
only
a
vulgar
tradesman
i
however
am
not
a
broker
nor
a
jew
of
the
article
superintendence
which
is
only
i
can
not
abate
a
dolt
on
the
rest
of
the
bill
if
you
mean
to
offer
ready
i
mean
without
any
negotiation
to
abate
thirty
per
cent
and
i
hope
that
is
a
fair
and
gentlemanly
offer
soho
there
is
your
money
lord
colambre
i
would
give
the
contents
of
three
such
bills
to
be
sure
of
such
noblemanly
conduct
as
yours
lady
clonbrony
furniture
shall
be
safely
packed
without
costing
her
a
farthing
with
the
help
of
edwards
the
solicitor
every
other
claim
was
soon
settled
and
lord
clonbrony
for
the
first
time
since
he
left
ireland
found
himself
out
of
debt
and
out
of
danger
old
nick
account
could
not
be
settled
in
london
lord
colambre
had
detected
numerous
false
charges
and
sundry
impositions
the
land
which
had
been
purposely
let
to
run
wild
so
far
from
yielding
any
rent
was
made
a
source
of
constant
expense
as
remaining
still
unset
this
was
a
large
tract
for
which
dennis
had
at
length
offered
a
small
rent
upon
a
fair
calculation
of
the
profits
of
the
ground
and
from
other
items
in
the
account
nicholas
garraghty
appeared
at
last
to
be
not
the
creditor
but
the
debtor
to
lord
clonbrony
he
was
dismissed
with
disgrace
which
perhaps
he
might
not
have
felt
if
it
had
not
been
accompanied
by
pecuniary
loss
and
followed
by
the
fear
of
losing
his
other
agencies
and
by
the
dread
of
immediate
bankruptcy
burke
was
appointed
agent
in
his
stead
to
the
clonbrony
as
well
as
the
colambre
estate
his
appointment
was
announced
to
him
by
the
following
letter
to
burke
at
colambre
dear
madam
the
traveller
whom
you
so
hospitably
received
some
months
ago
was
lord
colambre
he
now
writes
to
you
in
his
proper
person
he
promised
you
that
he
would
as
far
as
it
might
be
in
his
power
do
justice
to
burke
conduct
and
character
by
representing
what
he
had
done
for
lord
clonbrony
in
the
town
of
colambre
and
in
the
whole
management
of
the
tenantry
and
property
under
his
care
happily
for
my
father
my
dear
madam
he
is
now
as
fully
convinced
as
you
could
wish
him
to
be
of
burke
merits
and
he
begs
me
to
express
his
sense
of
the
obligations
he
is
under
to
him
and
to
you
he
entreats
that
you
will
pardon
the
impropriety
of
a
letter
which
as
i
assured
you
the
moment
i
saw
it
he
never
wrote
or
read
this
will
he
says
cure
him
for
life
of
putting
his
signature
to
any
paper
without
reading
it
he
hopes
that
you
will
forget
that
such
a
letter
was
ever
received
and
that
you
will
use
your
influence
with
burke
to
induce
him
to
continue
to
our
family
his
regard
and
valuable
services
lord
clonbrony
encloses
a
power
of
attorney
enabling
burke
to
act
in
future
for
him
if
burke
will
do
him
that
favour
in
managing
the
clonbrony
as
well
as
the
colambre
estate
lord
clonbrony
will
be
in
ireland
in
the
course
of
next
month
and
intends
to
have
the
pleasure
of
soon
paying
his
respects
in
person
to
burke
at
i
am
dear
madam
your
obliged
guest
and
faithful
servant
colambre
grosvenor
square
london
lord
colambre
was
so
continually
occupied
with
business
during
the
two
days
previous
to
his
coming
of
age
every
morning
at
his
solicitor
chambers
every
evening
in
his
father
study
that
miss
nugent
never
saw
him
but
at
breakfast
or
dinner
and
though
she
watched
for
it
most
anxiously
never
could
find
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
alone
or
of
asking
an
explanation
of
the
change
and
inconsistencies
of
his
manner
at
last
she
began
to
think
that
in
the
midst
of
so
much
business
of
importance
by
which
he
seemed
harassed
she
should
do
wrong
to
torment
him
by
speaking
of
any
small
disquietude
that
concerned
only
herself
she
determined
to
suppress
her
doubts
to
keep
her
feelings
to
herself
and
to
endeavour
by
constant
kindness
to
regain
that
place
in
his
affections
which
she
imagined
that
she
had
lost
will
go
right
again
thought
she
we
shall
all
be
happy
when
he
returns
with
us
to
ireland
to
that
dear
home
which
he
loves
as
well
as
i
do
the
day
lord
colambre
was
of
age
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
sign
a
bond
for
five
thousand
pounds
miss
nugent
fortune
which
had
been
lent
to
his
father
who
was
her
guardian
sir
i
believe
said
he
giving
it
to
his
father
as
soon
as
signed
i
believe
is
the
first
debt
you
would
wish
to
have
secured
thought
of
my
dear
boy
i
god
bless
you
that
has
weighed
more
upon
my
conscience
and
heart
than
all
the
rest
though
i
never
said
anything
about
it
i
used
whenever
i
met
salisbury
to
wish
myself
fairly
down
at
the
centre
of
the
earth
not
that
he
ever
thought
of
fortune
i
sure
for
he
often
told
me
and
i
believed
him
he
would
rather
have
miss
nugent
without
a
penny
if
he
could
get
her
than
the
first
fortune
in
the
empire
but
i
glad
she
will
not
go
to
him
penniless
for
all
that
and
by
my
fault
especially
there
there
my
name
to
it
do
witness
it
terry
but
colambre
you
must
give
it
to
her
you
must
take
it
to
grace
me
sir
it
is
no
gift
of
mine
it
is
a
debt
of
yours
i
beg
you
will
take
the
bond
to
her
yourself
my
dear
father
dear
son
you
must
not
always
have
your
own
way
and
hide
everything
good
you
do
or
give
me
the
honour
of
it
i
wo
be
the
jay
in
borrowed
feathers
i
have
borrowed
enough
in
my
life
and
i
done
with
borrowing
now
thanks
to
you
colambre
so
come
along
with
me
for
i
be
hanged
if
ever
i
give
this
joint
bond
to
miss
nugent
without
you
along
with
me
leave
lady
clonbrony
here
to
sign
these
papers
terry
will
witness
them
properly
and
you
come
along
with
me
pray
my
lord
said
her
ladyship
the
carriage
to
the
door
for
as
soon
as
you
have
my
signature
i
hope
you
let
me
off
to
buxton
certainly
the
carriage
is
ordered
everything
ready
my
dear
pray
tell
grace
to
be
ready
added
lady
clonbrony
not
necessary
for
she
is
always
ready
said
lord
clonbrony
colambre
added
he
taking
his
son
under
the
arm
and
carrying
him
up
to
miss
nugent
they
knocked
and
were
admitted
said
lord
clonbrony
always
ready
so
i
said
here
colambre
my
darling
continued
he
secured
your
fortune
to
you
to
my
heart
content
but
he
would
not
condescend
to
come
up
to
tell
you
so
till
i
made
him
here
the
bond
put
your
hand
to
it
colambre
you
were
ready
enough
to
do
that
when
it
cost
you
something
and
now
all
i
have
to
ask
of
you
is
to
persuade
her
to
marry
out
of
hand
that
i
may
see
her
happy
before
i
die
now
my
heart
at
ease
i
can
meet
salisbury
with
a
safe
conscience
one
kiss
my
little
grace
if
anybody
can
persuade
you
i
sure
it
that
man
that
now
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
it
colambre
will
or
your
heart
not
made
like
mine
so
i
leave
you
and
out
of
the
room
walked
he
leaving
his
poor
son
in
as
awkward
embarrassing
and
painful
a
situation
as
could
well
be
conceived
half
a
dozen
indistinct
ideas
crossed
his
mind
quick
conflicting
feelings
made
his
heart
beat
and
stop
and
how
it
would
have
ended
if
he
had
been
left
to
himself
whether
he
would
have
stood
or
fallen
have
spoken
or
have
continued
silent
can
never
now
be
known
for
all
was
decided
without
the
action
of
his
will
he
was
awakened
from
his
trance
by
these
simple
words
from
miss
nugent
much
obliged
to
you
cousin
colambre
more
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
in
thinking
of
me
first
in
the
midst
of
all
your
other
business
than
by
your
securing
my
fortune
friendship
and
your
friendship
is
worth
more
to
me
than
fortune
may
i
believe
that
is
secured
it
oh
grace
can
you
doubt
it
will
not
it
would
make
me
too
unhappy
i
will
not
need
not
is
enough
i
am
satisfied
i
ask
no
farther
explanation
you
are
truth
itself
one
word
from
you
is
security
sufficient
we
are
friends
for
life
said
she
taking
his
hand
between
both
of
hers
not
we
are
and
therefore
sit
down
cousin
grace
and
let
me
claim
the
privilege
of
friendship
and
speak
to
you
of
him
who
aspires
to
be
more
than
your
friend
for
life
mr
salisbury
said
miss
nugent
saw
him
yesterday
we
had
a
very
long
conversation
i
believe
he
understands
my
sentiments
perfectly
and
that
he
no
longer
thinks
of
being
more
to
me
than
a
friend
for
life
have
refused
him
i
have
a
high
opinion
of
salisbury
understanding
a
great
esteem
for
his
character
i
like
his
manners
and
conversation
but
i
do
not
love
him
and
therefore
you
know
i
could
not
marry
him
my
dear
miss
nugent
with
a
high
opinion
a
great
esteem
and
liking
his
manners
and
conversation
in
such
a
mind
as
yours
can
there
be
a
better
foundation
for
love
is
an
excellent
foundation
said
she
i
never
went
any
farther
than
the
foundation
and
indeed
i
never
wished
to
proceed
any
farther
lord
colambre
scarcely
dared
to
ask
why
but
after
some
pause
he
said
do
wish
to
intrude
upon
your
confidence
can
not
intrude
upon
my
confidence
i
am
ready
to
give
it
to
you
entirely
frankly
i
hesitated
only
because
another
person
was
concerned
do
you
remember
at
my
aunt
gala
a
lady
who
danced
with
mr
salisbury
in
the
least
lady
with
whom
you
and
salisbury
were
talking
just
before
supper
in
the
turkish
tent
in
the
least
we
went
down
to
supper
you
told
me
you
had
had
a
delightful
conversation
with
her
that
you
thought
her
a
charming
woman
charming
woman
i
have
not
the
slightest
recollection
of
her
you
told
me
that
she
and
salisbury
had
been
praising
me
a
et
i
recollect
her
now
perfectly
said
lord
colambre
what
of
her
is
the
woman
who
i
hope
will
be
salisbury
ever
since
i
have
been
acquainted
with
them
both
i
have
seen
that
they
were
suited
to
each
other
and
fancy
indeed
i
am
almost
sure
that
she
could
love
him
tenderly
love
him
and
i
know
i
could
not
but
my
own
sentiments
you
may
be
sure
are
all
i
ever
told
mr
salisbury
of
your
own
sentiments
you
may
not
be
sure
said
lord
colambre
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
give
him
up
from
false
generosity
interrupted
miss
nugent
totally
misunderstand
me
there
is
no
generosity
nothing
for
me
to
give
up
in
the
case
i
did
not
refuse
salisbury
from
generosity
but
because
i
did
not
love
him
perhaps
my
seeing
this
at
first
prevented
me
from
thinking
of
him
as
a
lover
but
from
whatever
cause
i
certainly
never
felt
love
for
salisbury
nor
any
of
that
pity
which
is
said
to
lead
to
love
perhaps
added
she
smiling
i
was
aware
that
he
would
be
so
much
better
off
after
i
refused
him
so
much
happier
with
one
suited
to
him
in
age
talents
fortune
and
love
what
bliss
did
he
but
know
his
bliss
were
his
he
but
know
his
bliss
repeated
lord
colambre
is
not
he
the
best
judge
of
his
own
bliss
am
not
i
the
best
judge
of
mine
said
miss
nugent
go
no
farther
are
and
i
have
no
right
to
go
farther
yet
this
much
permit
me
to
say
my
dear
grace
that
it
would
give
me
sincere
pleasure
that
is
real
satisfaction
to
see
you
happily
established
you
my
dear
lord
colambre
but
you
spoke
that
like
a
man
of
seventy
at
least
with
the
most
solemn
gravity
of
demeanour
meant
to
be
serious
not
solemn
said
lord
colambre
endeavouring
to
change
his
tone
now
said
she
in
a
playful
tone
have
seriously
accomplished
the
task
my
good
uncle
set
you
so
i
will
report
well
of
you
to
him
and
certify
that
you
did
all
that
in
you
lay
to
exhort
me
to
marry
that
you
have
even
assured
me
that
it
would
give
you
sincere
pleasure
that
is
real
satisfaction
to
see
me
happily
established
grace
if
you
knew
how
much
i
felt
when
i
said
that
you
would
spare
this
raillery
will
be
serious
i
am
most
seriously
convinced
of
the
sincerity
of
your
affection
for
me
i
know
my
happiness
is
your
object
in
all
you
have
said
and
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
the
interest
you
take
about
me
but
really
and
truly
i
do
not
wish
to
marry
this
is
not
a
mere
commonplace
speech
but
i
have
not
yet
seen
any
man
i
could
love
i
like
you
cousin
colambre
better
than
salisbury
i
would
rather
live
with
you
than
with
him
you
know
that
is
a
certain
proof
that
i
am
not
likely
to
be
in
love
with
him
i
am
happy
as
i
am
especially
now
we
are
all
going
to
dear
ireland
home
to
live
together
you
can
not
conceive
with
what
pleasure
i
look
forward
to
that
lord
colambre
was
not
vain
but
love
quickly
sees
love
where
it
exists
or
foresees
the
probability
the
possibility
of
its
existence
he
saw
that
miss
nugent
might
love
him
tenderly
passionately
but
that
duty
habit
the
prepossession
that
it
was
impossible
she
could
marry
her
cousin
colambre
a
prepossession
instilled
into
her
by
his
mother
had
absolutely
prevented
her
from
ever
yet
thinking
of
him
as
a
lover
he
saw
the
hazard
for
her
he
felt
the
danger
for
himself
never
had
she
appeared
to
him
so
attractive
as
at
this
moment
when
he
felt
the
hope
that
he
could
obtain
return
of
love
st
omar
why
why
is
she
a
st
omar
illegitimate
no
omar
sans
reproche
my
wife
she
can
not
be
i
will
not
engage
her
affections
swift
as
thoughts
in
moments
of
strong
feeling
pass
in
the
mind
without
being
put
into
words
our
hero
thought
all
this
and
determined
cost
what
it
would
to
act
honourably
spoke
of
my
returning
to
ireland
my
dear
grace
i
have
not
yet
told
you
my
plans
are
not
you
returning
with
us
said
she
precipitately
not
you
going
to
ireland
home
with
us
i
am
going
to
serve
a
campaign
or
two
abroad
i
think
every
young
man
in
these
times
heavens
what
does
this
mean
what
can
you
mean
cried
she
fixing
her
eyes
upon
his
as
if
she
would
read
his
very
soul
what
reason
oh
tell
me
the
truth
and
at
once
his
change
of
colour
his
hand
that
trembled
and
withdrew
from
hers
the
expression
of
his
eyes
as
they
met
hers
revealed
the
truth
to
her
at
once
as
it
flashed
across
her
mind
she
started
back
her
face
grew
crimson
and
in
the
same
instant
pale
as
death
you
see
you
feel
the
truth
now
said
lord
colambre
see
you
feel
that
i
love
you
passionately
let
me
not
hear
it
said
she
must
not
ought
not
never
till
this
moment
did
such
a
thought
cross
my
mind
i
thought
it
impossible
oh
make
me
think
so
still
will
it
is
impossible
that
we
can
ever
be
united
always
thought
so
said
she
taking
breath
with
a
deep
sigh
why
not
live
as
we
have
lived
can
not
i
can
not
answer
for
myself
i
will
not
run
the
risk
and
therefore
i
must
quit
you
knowing
as
i
do
that
there
is
an
invincible
obstacle
to
our
union
of
what
nature
i
can
not
explain
i
beg
you
not
to
inquire
need
not
beg
it
i
shall
not
inquire
i
have
no
curiosity
none
said
she
in
a
passive
dejected
tone
is
not
what
i
am
thinking
of
in
the
least
i
know
there
are
invincible
obstacles
i
wish
it
to
be
so
but
if
invincible
you
who
have
so
much
sense
honour
and
virtue
hope
my
dear
cousin
that
i
have
honour
and
virtue
but
there
are
temptations
to
which
no
wise
no
good
man
will
expose
himself
innocent
creature
you
do
not
know
the
power
of
love
i
rejoice
that
you
have
always
thought
it
impossible
think
so
still
it
will
save
you
from
all
i
must
endure
think
of
me
but
as
your
cousin
your
friend
give
your
heart
to
some
happier
man
as
your
friend
your
true
friend
i
conjure
you
give
your
heart
to
some
more
fortunate
man
marry
if
you
can
feel
love
marry
and
be
happy
honour
virtue
yes
i
have
both
and
i
will
not
forfeit
them
yes
i
will
merit
your
esteem
and
my
own
by
actions
not
words
and
i
give
you
the
strongest
proof
by
tearing
myself
from
you
at
this
moment
farewell
carriage
at
the
door
miss
nugent
and
my
lady
calling
for
you
said
her
maid
your
key
and
here
your
gloves
my
dear
carriage
at
the
door
miss
nugent
said
lady
clonbrony
woman
coming
eagerly
with
parcels
in
her
hand
as
miss
nugent
passed
her
and
ran
downstairs
i
do
know
where
i
laid
my
lady
numbrella
for
my
life
do
your
anne
indeed
but
i
know
here
my
own
young
lady
watch
that
she
has
left
bless
me
i
never
knew
her
to
forget
anything
on
a
journey
before
she
is
going
to
be
married
as
sure
as
my
name
le
maistre
and
to
my
lord
colambre
for
he
has
been
here
this
hour
to
my
certain
bible
knowledge
oh
you
see
she
will
be
lady
colambre
wish
she
may
with
all
my
heart
said
anne
i
must
run
down
they
waiting
no
said
le
maistre
seizing
anne
arm
and
holding
her
fast
you
may
safely
for
they
all
kissing
and
taking
leave
and
all
that
you
know
and
my
lady
is
talking
on
about
soho
and
giving
a
hundred
directions
about
legs
of
tables
and
so
forth
i
warrant
she
always
an
hour
after
she
ready
before
she
gets
in
and
i
looking
for
the
numbrella
so
stay
and
tell
me
petito
wrote
over
word
it
was
to
be
lady
isabel
and
then
a
contradiction
came
it
was
turned
into
the
youngest
of
the
killpatricks
and
now
here
he
in
miss
nugent
to
the
last
moment
now
in
my
opinion
that
am
not
censorious
this
does
not
look
so
pretty
but
according
to
my
verdict
he
is
only
making
a
fool
of
miss
nugent
like
the
rest
and
his
lordship
seems
too
like
what
you
might
call
a
male
cocket
or
a
masculine
jilt
more
like
a
masculine
jilt
than
yourself
le
maistre
cried
anne
taking
fire
my
young
lady
is
not
a
lady
to
be
made
a
fool
of
i
promise
you
nor
is
my
lord
likely
to
make
a
fool
of
any
woman
us
all
that
no
great
praise
for
any
young
nobleman
miss
anne
le
maistre
le
maistre
are
you
above
cried
a
footman
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
lady
calling
for
you
well
very
well
said
sharp
le
maistre
well
and
if
she
is
manners
sir
come
up
for
one
ca
you
and
do
stand
bawling
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
as
if
one
had
no
ears
to
be
saved
i
coming
as
fast
as
i
conveniently
can
le
maistre
stood
in
the
doorway
so
as
to
fill
it
up
and
prevent
anne
from
passing
anne
miss
anne
le
maistre
cried
another
footman
lady
in
the
carriage
and
miss
nugent
nugent
is

cried
le
maistre
running
downstairs
followed
by
anne
for
the
world
in
would
i
have
missed
seeing
him

nugent
in
for
by
that
i
could
have
judged
definitively
lord

beg

i
afeard

le
maistre
as

the
hall

a
thousand
pardons
but
i
was
hunting
high
and
low
for
my
lady
numbrella
lord
colambre
did
not
hear
or
heed
her
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
they
never
moved
lord
clonbrony
was
at
the
open
kneeling
on
the
step
and
receiving
lady
clonbrony
last
words
for
soho
the
two
stood
together
on
the
steps
at
our
young
lord
how
he
stands
whispered
le
maistre
to
anne
image
of
despair
and
she
the
picture
of
death
i
do
know
what
to
think
i
but
do
stare
if
you
can
help
it
said
anne
in
get
in

she
as

said
lady
clonbrony
as
to
bloom

in

cheeks

from

farthest
side
of
the
coach
to
the
window
colambre

forced
to
appear

forgot
to
say
that

so
ill
in
my
life

you
grace
as
he
did
the
minute
we
drove
on
he
should
take
advice
i
a
mind
cried
lady
clonbrony
laying
her
hand
on
the
cord
to
stop
the
coachman
a
mind
to
turn
about

him
so
and
ask
what

the
matter

scarcely
able
to
speak
lady
clonbrony

go
the
cord
what

the
matter
with
you
my
dear
grace
for
you
are
certainly

soon

salisbury
drove
on
rapidly
lady
clonbrony
ideas

taken
the
salisbury
channel

know
that
salisbury
was
going
to
buxton

replied
lady
clonbrony

love

brought
the
fine
bloom
back

chapter
xv
for
ever
gone
from
me
said
lord
colambre
to
himself
as
the
carriage
drove
away
shall
i
see
her
more
never
will
i
see
her
more
till
she
is
married
lord
colambre
went
to
his
own
room
locked
the
door
and
was
relieved
in
some
degree
by
the
sense
of
privacy
by
the
feeling
that
he
could
now
indulge
his
reflections
undisturbed
he
had
consolation
he
had
done
what
was
honourable
he
had
transgressed
no
duty
abandoned
no
principle
he
had
not
injured
the
happiness
of
any
human
being
he
had
not
to
gratify
himself
hazarded
the
peace
of
the
woman
he
loved
he
had
not
sought
to
win
her
heart
of
her
innocent
her
warm
susceptible
heart
he
might
perhaps
have
robbed
her
he
knew
it
but
he
had
left
it
untouched
he
hoped
entire
in
her
own
power
to
bless
with
it
hereafter
some
man
worthy
of
her
in
the
hope
that
she
might
be
happy
lord
colambre
felt
relief
and
in
the
consciousness
that
he
had
made
his
parents
happy
he
rejoiced
but
as
soon
as
his
mind
turned
that
way
for
consolation
came
the
bitter
concomitant
reflection
that
his
mother
must
be
disappointed
in
her
hopes
of
his
accompanying
her
home
and
of
his
living
with
her
in
ireland
she
would
be
miserable
when
she
should
hear
that
he
was
going
abroad
into
the
army
and
yet
it
must
be
so
and
he
must
write
and
tell
her
so
sooner
this
difficulty
is
off
my
mind
the
sooner
this
painful
letter
is
written
the
better
thought
he
must
be
done
i
will
do
it
immediately
he
snatched
up
his
pen
and
began
a
letter
my
dear
mother
miss
nugent
he
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
his
door
gentleman
below
my
lord
said
a
servant
wishes
to
see
you
i
can
not
see
any
gentleman
did
you
say
i
was
at
home
my
lord
i
said
you
was
not
at
home
for
i
thought
you
would
not
choose
to
be
at
home
and
your
own
man
was
not
in
the
way
for
me
to
ask
so
i
denied
you
but
the
gentleman
would
not
be
denied
he
said
i
must
come
and
see
if
you
was
at
home
so
as
he
spoke
as
if
he
was
a
gentleman
not
used
to
be
denied
i
thought
it
might
be
somebody
of
consequence
and
i
showed
him
into
the
front
i
think
he
said
he
was
sure
you
be
at
home
for
a
friend
from
ireland
friend
from
ireland
why
did
not
you
tell
me
that
sooner
said
lord
colambre
rising
and
running
downstairs
james
brooke
i
daresay
no
not
sir
james
brooke
but
one
he
was
almost
as
glad
to
see
count
dear
count
the
greater
pleasure
for
being
unexpected
came
to
london
but
yesterday
said
the
count
i
could
not
be
here
a
day
without
doing
myself
the
honour
of
paying
my
respects
to
lord
colambre
do
me
not
only
honour
but
pleasure
my
dear
count
people
when
they
like
one
another
always
find
each
other
out
and
contrive
to
meet
even
in
london
are
too
polite
to
ask
what
brought
such
a
superannuated
militaire
as
i
am
said
the
count
his
retirement
into
this
gay
world
again
a
relation
of
mine
who
is
one
of
our
ministry
knew
that
i
had
some
maps
and
plans
and
charts
which
might
be
serviceable
in
an
expedition
they
are
planning
i
might
have
trusted
my
charts
across
the
channel
without
coming
myself
to
convoy
them
you
will
say
but
my
relation
fancied
young
relations
you
know
if
they
are
good
for
anything
are
apt
to
overvalue
the
heads
of
old
relations
fancied
that
mine
was
worth
bringing
all
the
way
from
halloran
castle
to
london
to
consult
with
so
you
know
when
this
was
signified
to
me
by
a
letter
from
the
secretary
in
office
private
most
confidential
what
could
i
do
but
do
myself
the
honour
to
obey
for
though
honour
voice
can
not
provoke
the
silent
dust
yet
flattery
soothes
the
dull
cold
ear
of
age
but
enough
and
too
much
of
myself
said
the
count
me
my
dear
lord
something
of
yourself
i
do
not
think
england
seems
to
agree
with
you
so
well
as
ireland
for
excuse
me
in
point
of
health
you
do
look
like
the
same
man
i
saw
some
weeks
ago
mind
has
been
ill
at
ease
of
late
said
lord
colambre
there
the
thing
the
body
pays
for
the
mind
but
those
who
have
feeling
minds
pain
and
pleasure
altogether
computed
have
the
advantage
or
at
least
they
think
so
for
they
would
not
change
with
those
who
have
them
not
were
they
to
gain
by
the
bargain
the
most
robust
body
that
the
most
selfish
coxcomb
or
the
heaviest
dunce
extant
ever
boasted
for
instance
would
you
now
my
lord
at
this
moment
change
altogether
with
major
benson
or
captain
williamson
or
even
our
friend
really
now
pon
honour
would
you
i
glad
to
see
you
smile
thank
you
for
making
me
smile
for
i
assure
you
i
want
it
i
wish
if
you
would
not
think
me
encroaching
upon
your
politeness
and
kindness
in
honouring
me
with
this
visit
you
see
continued
he
opening
the
doors
of
the
back
and
pointing
to
large
packages
see
we
are
all
preparing
for
a
march
my
mother
has
left
town
half
an
hour
ago
my
father
engaged
to
dine
abroad
only
i
at
home
and
in
this
state
of
confusion
could
i
even
venture
to
ask
count
to
stay
and
dine
with
me
without
being
able
to
offer
him
irish
ortolans
or
irish
plums
in
short
will
you
let
me
rob
you
of
two
or
three
hours
of
your
time
i
am
anxious
to
have
your
opinion
on
a
subject
of
some
importance
to
me
and
on
one
where
you
are
peculiarly
qualified
to
judge
and
decide
for
me
dear
lord
frankly
i
have
nothing
half
so
good
or
so
agreeable
to
do
with
my
time
command
my
hours
i
have
already
told
you
how
much
it
flatters
me
to
be
consulted
by
the
most
helpless
clerk
in
office
how
much
more
about
the
private
concerns
of
an
enlightened
young
friend
will
lord
colambre
permit
me
to
say
i
hope
so
for
though
the
length
of
our
acquaintance
might
not
justify
the
word
yet
regard
and
intimacy
are
not
always
in
proportion
to
the
time
people
have
known
each
other
but
to
their
mutual
perception
of
certain
attaching
qualities
a
certain
similarity
and
suitableness
of
character
the
good
count
seeing
that
lord
colambre
was
in
much
distress
of
mind
did
all
he
could
to
soothe
him
by
kindness
far
from
making
any
difficulty
about
giving
up
a
few
hours
of
his
time
he
seemed
to
have
no
other
object
in
london
and
no
purpose
in
life
but
to
attend
to
our
hero
to
put
him
at
ease
and
to
give
him
time
to
recover
and
arrange
his
thoughts
the
count
talked
of
indifferent
subjects
think
i
heard
you
mention
the
name
of
sir
james
brooke
i
expected
to
have
seen
him
when
the
servant
first
mentioned
a
friend
from
ireland
because
sir
james
had
told
me
that
as
soon
as
he
could
get
leave
of
absence
he
would
come
to
england
is
come
is
now
at
his
estate
is
huntingdonshire
doing
what
do
you
think
i
will
give
you
a
leading
hint
recollect
the
seal
which
the
little
de
cresey
put
into
your
hands
the
day
you
dined
at
oranmore
faithful
to
his
motto
deeds
not
words
he
is
this
instant
i
believe
at
deeds
making
out
marriage
settlements
getting
ready
to
put
his
seal
to
the
happy
articles
man
i
give
him
joy
said
lord
colambre
man
going
to
be
married
to
such
a
woman
daughter
of
such
a
mother
of
such
a
mother
that
is
indeed
a
great
addition
and
a
great
security
to
his
happiness
said
the
count
a
family
to
marry
into
good
from
generation
to
generation
illustrious
by
character
as
well
as
by
genealogy
all
the
sons
brave
and
all
the
daughters
chaste
lord
colambre
with
difficulty
repressed
his
i
could
choose
i
would
rather
that
a
woman
i
loved
were
of
such
a
family
than
that
she
had
for
her
dower
the
mines
of
peru
would
i
cried
lord
colambre
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
my
lord
and
with
such
energy
so
few
young
men
of
the
present
day
look
to
what
i
call
good
connexion
in
marrying
a
man
does
not
to
be
sure
marry
his
wife
mother
and
yet
a
prudent
man
when
he
begins
to
think
of
the
daughter
would
look
sharp
at
the
mother
ay
and
back
to
the
grandmother
too
and
along
the
whole
female
line
of
ancestry
most
true
he
ought
he
must
i
have
a
notion
said
the
count
smiling
lordship
practice
has
been
conformable
to
your
theory
mine
said
lord
colambre
starling
and
looking
at
the
count
with
surprise
beg
your
pardon
said
the
count
did
not
intend
to
surprise
your
confidence
but
you
forget
that
i
was
present
and
saw
the
impression
which
was
made
on
your
mind
by
a
mother
want
of
a
proper
sense
of
delicacy
and
propriety
lady
dashfort
lady
dashfort
she
was
quite
out
of
my
head
lady
isabel
i
hope
she
is
quite
out
of
your
heart
never
was
in
it
said
lord
colambre
laid
siege
to
it
said
the
count
i
am
glad
your
heart
did
not
surrender
at
discretion
or
rather
without
discretion
then
i
may
tell
you
without
fear
or
preface
that
the
lady
isabel
who
talks
of
refinement
delicacy
sense
is
going
to
stoop
at
once
and
marry
heathcock
lord
colambre
was
not
surprised
but
concerned
and
disgusted
as
he
always
felt
even
when
he
did
not
care
for
the
individual
from
hearing
anything
which
tended
to
lower
the
female
sex
in
public
estimation
to
myself
said
he
can
not
say
i
have
had
an
escape
for
i
do
think
i
ever
was
in
much
danger
is
difficult
to
measure
danger
when
it
is
over
past
danger
like
past
pain
is
soon
forgotten
said
the
old
general
all
events
i
rejoice
in
your
present
safety
is
she
really
going
to
be
married
to
heathcock
said
lord
colambre
they
all
came
over
in
the
same
packet
with
me
and
they
are
all
in
town
now
buying
jewels
and
equipages
and
horses
heathcock
you
know
is
as
good
as
another
man
a
peu
pres
for
all
those
purposes
his
father
is
dead
and
left
him
a
large
estate
que
voulez
vous
as
the
french
valet
said
to
me
on
the
occasion
que
monsieur
est
un
homme
de
bien
il
a
des
biens
a
ce
dit
lord
colambre
could
not
help
smiling
they
got
heathcock
to
fall
in
love
is
what
puzzles
me
said
his
lordship
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
an
oyster
falling
in
love
as
that
being
own
i
should
have
sooner
thought
replied
the
count
his
falling
in
love
with
an
oyster
and
so
would
you
if
you
had
seen
him
as
i
did
devouring
oysters
on
shipboard
can
the
lovely
heroine
hope
to
vie
br
with
a
fat
turtle
or
a
pie
br
but
that
is
not
our
affair
let
the
lady
isabel
look
to
it
dinner
was
announced
and
no
farther
conversation
of
any
consequence
passed
between
the
count
and
lord
colambre
till
the
cloth
was
removed
and
the
servants
had
withdrawn
then
our
hero
opened
on
the
subject
which
was
heavy
at
his
heart
dear
count
to
go
back
to
the
burial
place
of
the
nugents
where
my
head
was
lost
the
first
time
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
you
know
or
possibly
said
he
smiling
do
not
know
that
i
have
a
cousin
of
the
name
of
nugent
told
me
replied
the
count
you
had
near
relations
of
that
name
but
i
do
not
recollect
that
you
mentioned
any
one
in
particular
never
named
miss
nugent
to
you
no
it
is
not
easy
to
me
to
talk
of
her
and
impossible
to
me
to
describe
her
if
you
had
come
one
sooner
this
morning
you
would
have
seen
her
i
know
she
is
exactly
suited
to
your
excellent
taste
but
it
is
not
at
first
sight
she
pleases
most
she
gains
upon
the
affections
attaches
the
heart
and
unfolds
upon
the
judgment
in
temper
manners
and
good
sense
in
every
quality
a
man
can
or
should
desire
in
a
wife
i
never
saw
her
equal
yet
there
is
an
obstacle
an
invincible
obstacle
the
nature
of
which
i
can
not
explain
to
you
that
forbids
me
to
think
of
her
as
a
wife
she
lives
with
my
father
and
mother
they
are
returning
to
ireland
i
wished
earnestly
wished
on
many
accounts
to
have
accompanied
them
chiefly
on
my
mother
but
it
can
not
be
the
first
thing
a
man
must
do
is
to
act
honourably
and
that
he
may
do
so
he
must
keep
out
of
the
way
of
a
temptation
which
he
believes
to
be
above
his
strength
i
will
never
see
miss
nugent
again
till
she
is
married
i
must
either
stay
in
england
or
go
abroad
i
have
a
mind
to
serve
a
campaign
or
two
if
i
could
get
a
commission
in
a
regiment
going
to
spain
but
i
understand
so
many
are
eager
to
go
at
this
moment
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
a
commission
in
such
a
regiment
is
difficult
said
the
count
added
he
after
thinking
for
a
moment
have
it
i
can
get
the
thing
done
for
you
and
directly
major
benson
in
consequence
of
that
affair
you
know
about
his
mistress
is
forced
to
quit
the
regiment
when
the
came
to
quarters
and
the
rest
of
the
officers
heard
the
fact
they
would
not
keep
company
with
benson
and
would
not
mess
with
him
i
know
he
wants
to
sell
out
and
that
regiment
is
to
be
ordered
immediately
to
spain
i
will
have
the
thing
done
for
you
if
you
request
it
give
me
your
advice
count
you
are
well
acquainted
with
the
military
profession
with
military
life
would
you
advise
me
i
wo
speak
of
myself
because
we
judge
better
by
general
views
than
by
particular
cases
would
you
advise
a
young
man
at
present
to
go
into
the
army
the
count
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
replied
you
seriously
ask
my
opinion
my
lord
i
must
lay
aside
my
own
prepossessions
and
endeavour
to
speak
with
impartiality
to
go
into
the
army
in
these
days
my
lord
is
in
my
sober
opinion
the
most
absurd
and
base
or
the
wisest
and
noblest
thing
a
young
man
can
do
to
enter
into
the
army
with
the
hope
of
escaping
from
the
application
necessary
to
acquire
knowledge
letters
and
science
i
run
no
risk
my
lord
in
saying
this
to
you
to
go
into
the
army
with
the
hope
of
escaping
from
knowledge
letters
science
and
morality
to
wear
a
red
coat
and
an
epaulette
to
be
called
captain
to
figure
at
a
ball
to
lounge
away
time
in
country
sports
at
country
quarters
was
never
even
in
times
of
peace
creditable
but
it
is
now
absurd
and
base
submitting
to
a
certain
portion
of
ennui
and
contempt
this
mode
of
life
for
an
officer
was
formerly
practicable
but
now
can
not
be
submitted
to
without
utter
irremediable
disgrace
officers
are
now
in
general
men
of
education
and
information
want
of
knowledge
sense
manners
must
consequently
be
immediately
detected
ridiculed
and
despised
in
a
military
man
of
this
we
have
not
long
since
seen
lamentable
examples
in
the
raw
officers
who
have
lately
disgraced
themselves
in
my
neighbourhood
in
ireland
that
major
benson
and
captain
williamson
but
i
will
not
advert
to
such
insignificant
individuals
such
are
rare
exceptions
i
leave
them
out
of
the
question
i
reason
on
general
principles
the
life
of
an
officer
is
not
now
a
life
of
parade
of
coxcombical
or
of
profligate
idleness
but
of
active
service
of
continual
hardship
and
danger
all
the
descriptions
which
we
see
in
ancient
history
of
a
soldier
life
descriptions
which
in
times
of
peace
appeared
like
romance
are
now
realised
military
exploits
fill
every
day
newspapers
every
day
conversation
a
martial
spirit
is
now
essential
to
the
liberty
and
the
existence
of
our
own
country
in
the
present
state
of
things
the
military
must
be
the
most
honourable
profession
because
the
most
useful
every
movement
of
an
army
is
followed
wherever
it
goes
by
the
public
hopes
and
fears
every
officer
must
now
feel
besides
this
sense
of
collective
importance
a
belief
that
his
only
dependence
must
be
on
his
own
merit
and
thus
his
ambition
his
enthusiasm
are
raised
and
when
once
this
noble
ardour
is
kindled
in
the
breast
it
excites
to
exertion
and
supports
under
endurance
but
i
forget
myself
said
the
count
checking
his
enthusiasm
promised
to
speak
soberly
if
i
have
said
too
much
your
own
good
sense
my
lord
will
correct
me
and
your
will
forgive
the
prolixity
of
an
old
man
touched
upon
his
favourite
subject
the
passion
of
his
youth
lord
colambre
of
course
assured
the
count
that
he
was
not
tired
indeed
the
enthusiasm
with
which
this
old
officer
spoke
of
his
profession
and
the
high
point
of
view
in
which
he
placed
it
increased
our
hero
desire
to
serve
a
campaign
abroad
good
sense
politeness
and
experience
of
the
world
preserved
count
from
that
foible
with
which
old
officers
are
commonly
reproached
of
talking
continually
of
their
own
military
exploits
though
retired
from
the
world
he
had
contrived
by
reading
the
best
books
and
corresponding
with
persons
of
good
information
to
keep
up
with
the
current
of
modern
affairs
and
he
seldom
spoke
of
those
in
which
he
had
been
formerly
engaged
he
rather
too
studiously
avoided
speaking
of
himself
and
this
fear
of
egotism
diminished
the
peculiar
interest
he
might
have
inspired
it
disappointed
curiosity
and
deprived
those
with
whom
he
conversed
of
many
entertaining
and
instructive
anecdotes
however
he
sometimes
made
exceptions
to
his
general
rule
in
favour
of
persons
who
peculiarly
pleased
him
and
lord
colambre
was
of
this
number
he
this
evening
for
the
first
time
spoke
to
his
lordship
of
the
years
he
had
spent
in
the
austrian
service
told
him
anecdotes
of
the
emperor
spoke
of
many
distinguished
public
characters
whom
he
had
known
abroad
of
those
officers
who
had
been
his
friends
and
companions
among
others
he
mentioned
with
particular
regard
a
young
english
officer
who
had
been
at
the
same
time
with
him
in
the
austrian
service
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
reynolds
the
name
struck
lord
colambre
it
was
the
name
of
the
officer
who
had
been
the
cause
of
the
disgrace
of
miss
omar
of
miss
nugent
mother
there
are
so
many
reynoldses
he
eagerly
asked
the
age
the
character
of
this
officer
was
a
gallant
youth
said
the
count
too
adventurous
too
rash
he
fell
after
distinguishing
himself
in
a
glorious
manner
in
his
twentieth
year
died
in
my
arms
or
unmarried
cried
lord
colambre
he
had
been
privately
married
less
than
a
year
before
his
death
to
a
very
young
english
lady
who
had
been
educated
at
a
convent
in
vienna
he
was
heir
to
a
considerable
property
i
believe
and
the
young
lady
had
little
fortune
and
the
affair
was
kept
secret
from
the
fear
of
offending
his
friends
or
for
some
other
reason
i
do
not
recollect
the
particulars
he
acknowledge
his
marriage
said
lord
colambre
till
he
was
dying
then
he
confided
his
secret
to
me
you
recollect
the
name
of
the
young
lady
he
married
miss
st
omar
omar
repeated
lord
colambre
with
an
expression
of
lively
joy
in
his
countenance
are
you
certain
my
dear
count
that
she
was
really
married
legally
married
to
reynolds
her
marriage
has
been
denied
by
all
his
friends
and
relations
hers
have
never
been
able
to
establish
it
her
daughter
is
my
dear
count
were
you
present
at
the
marriage
said
the
count
was
not
present
at
the
marriage
i
never
saw
the
lady
nor
do
i
know
anything
of
the
affair
except
that
reynolds
when
he
was
dying
assured
me
that
he
was
privately
married
to
a
miss
omar
who
was
then
boarding
at
a
convent
in
vienna
the
young
man
expressed
great
regret
at
leaving
her
totally
unprovided
for
but
said
that
he
trusted
his
father
would
acknowledge
her
and
that
her
friends
would
be
reconciled
to
her
he
was
not
of
age
he
said
to
make
a
will
but
i
think
he
told
me
that
his
child
who
at
that
time
was
not
born
would
even
if
it
should
be
a
girl
inherit
a
considerable
property
with
this
i
can
not
however
charge
my
memory
positively
but
he
put
a
packet
into
my
hands
which
he
told
me
contained
a
certificate
of
his
marriage
and
i
think
he
said
a
letter
to
his
father
this
he
requested
that
i
would
transmit
to
england
by
some
safe
hand
immediately
after
his
death
i
went
to
the
english
ambassador
who
was
then
leaving
vienna
and
delivered
the
packet
into
his
hands
he
promised
to
have
it
safely
delivered
i
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
day
with
the
troops
to
a
distant
part
of
the
country
when
i
returned
i
inquired
at
the
convent
what
had
become
of
miss
omar
i
should
say
reynolds
and
i
was
told
that
she
had
removed
from
the
convent
to
private
lodgings
in
the
town
some
time
previous
to
the
birth
of
her
child
the
abbess
seemed
much
scandalised
by
the
whole
transaction
and
i
remember
i
relieved
her
mind
by
assuring
her
that
there
had
been
a
regular
marriage
for
poor
young
reynolds
sake
i
made
farther
inquiries
about
the
widow
intending
of
course
to
act
as
a
friend
if
she
was
in
any
difficulty
or
distress
but
i
found
on
inquiry
at
her
lodgings
that
her
brother
had
come
from
england
for
her
and
had
carried
her
and
her
infant
away
the
active
scenes
continued
the
count
which
i
was
immediately
afterwards
engaged
drove
the
whole
affair
from
my
mind
now
that
your
questions
have
recalled
them
i
feel
certain
of
the
facts
i
have
mentioned
and
i
am
ready
to
establish
them
by
my
testimony
lord
colambre
thanked
him
with
an
eagerness
that
showed
how
much
he
was
interested
in
the
event
it
was
clear
he
said
either
that
the
packet
left
with
the
ambassador
had
not
been
delivered
or
that
the
father
of
reynolds
had
suppressed
the
certificate
of
the
marriage
as
it
had
never
been
acknowledged
by
him
or
by
any
of
the
family
lord
colambre
now
frankly
told
the
count
why
he
was
so
anxious
about
this
affair
and
count
with
all
the
warmth
of
youth
and
with
all
the
ardent
generosity
characteristic
of
his
country
entered
into
his
feelings
declaring
that
he
would
never
rest
till
he
had
established
the
truth
said
the
count
ambassador
who
took
the
packet
in
charge
is
dead
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
difficulty
he
must
have
had
some
secretary
said
lord
colambre
was
his
secretary
we
can
apply
to
him
secretary
is
now
charge
in
vienna
we
can
not
get
at
him
whose
hands
have
that
ambassador
papers
fallen
who
is
his
executor
said
lord
colambre
executor
now
you
have
it
cried
the
count
executor
is
the
very
man
who
will
do
your
business
your
friend
sir
james
brooke
is
the
executor
all
papers
of
course
are
in
his
hands
or
he
can
have
access
to
any
that
are
in
the
hands
of
the
family
the
family
seat
is
within
a
few
miles
of
sir
james
brooke
in
huntingdonshire
where
as
i
told
you
before
he
now
is
go
to
him
immediately
set
out
in
the
mail
this
night
just
in
time
cried
lord
colambre
pulling
out
his
watch
with
one
hand
and
ringing
the
bell
with
the
other
and
take
a
place
for
me
in
the
mail
for
huntingdon
go
directly
said
lord
colambre
to
the
servant
take
two
places
if
you
please
sir
said
the
count
lord
i
will
accompany
you
but
this
lord
colambre
would
not
permit
as
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
fatigue
the
good
old
general
and
a
letter
from
him
to
sir
james
brooke
would
do
all
that
the
count
could
effect
by
his
presence
the
search
for
the
papers
would
be
made
by
sir
james
and
if
the
packet
could
be
recovered
or
if
any
memorandum
or
mode
of
ascertaining
that
it
had
actually
been
delivered
to
old
reynolds
could
be
discovered
lord
colambre
said
he
would
then
call
upon
the
count
for
his
assistance
and
trouble
him
to
identify
the
packet
or
to
go
with
him
to
reynolds
to
make
farther
inquiries
and
to
certify
at
all
events
the
young
man
dying
acknowledgment
of
his
marriage
and
of
his
child
the
place
in
the
mail
just
in
time
was
taken
lord
colambre
sent
a
servant
in
search
of
his
father
with
a
note
explaining
the
necessity
of
his
sudden
departure
all
the
business
which
remained
to
be
done
in
town
he
knew
lord
clonbrony
could
accomplish
without
his
assistance
then
he
wrote
a
few
lines
to
his
mother
on
the
very
sheet
of
paper
on
which
a
few
hours
before
he
had
sorrowfully
and
slowly
begun
my
dear
mother
miss
nugent
he
now
joyfully
and
rapidly
went
on
my
dear
mother
and
miss
nugent
i
hope
to
be
with
you
on
wednesday
but
if
unforeseen
circumstances
should
delay
me
i
will
certainly
write
to
you
dear
mother
believe
me
your
obliged
and
grateful
son
colambre
the
count
in
the
meantime
wrote
a
letter
for
him
to
sir
james
brooke
describing
the
packet
which
he
had
given
to
the
ambassador
and
relating
all
the
circumstances
that
could
lead
to
its
recovery
lord
colambre
almost
before
the
wax
was
hard
seized
possession
of
the
letter
the
count
seeming
almost
as
eager
to
hurry
him
off
as
he
was
to
set
out
he
thanked
the
count
with
few
words
but
with
strong
feeling
joy
and
love
returned
in
full
tide
upon
our
hero
soul
all
the
military
ideas
which
but
an
hour
before
filled
his
imagination
were
put
to
flight
spain
vanished
and
green
ireland
reappeared
just
as
they
shook
hands
at
parting
the
good
old
general
with
a
smile
said
to
him
believe
i
had
better
not
stir
in
the
matter
of
benson
commission
till
i
hear
more
from
you
my
harangue
in
favour
of
the
military
profession
will
i
fancy
prove
like
most
other
harangues
en
pure
perte
chapter
xvi
in
what
words
of
polite
circumlocution
or
of
cautious
diplomacy
shall
we
say
or
hint
that
the
deceased
ambassador
papers
were
found
in
shameful
disorder
his
excellency
executor
sir
james
brooke
however
was
indefatigable
in
his
researches
he
and
lord
colambre
spent
two
whole
days
in
looking
over
portfolios
of
letters
and
memorials
and
manifestoes
and
bundles
of
paper
of
the
most
heterogeneous
sorts
some
of
them
without
any
docket
or
direction
to
lead
to
a
knowledge
of
their
contents
others
written
upon
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
an
erroneous
notion
of
their
nature
so
that
it
was
necessary
to
untie
every
paper
separately
at
last
when
they
had
opened
as
they
thought
every
paper
and
wearied
and
in
despair
were
just
on
the
point
of
giving
up
the
search
lord
colambre
spied
a
bundle
of
old
newspapers
at
the
bottom
of
a
trunk
are
only
old
vienna
gazettes
i
looked
at
them
said
sir
james
lord
colambre
upon
this
assurance
was
going
to
throw
them
into
the
trunk
again
but
observing
that
the
bundle
had
not
been
untied
he
opened
it
and
of
the
newspapers
he
found
a
rough
copy
of
the
ambassador
journal
and
with
it
the
packet
directed
to
ralph
reynolds
old
court
suffolk
per
favour
of
his
excellency
earl
a
note
on
the
cover
signed
stating
when
received
by
him
and
the
date
of
the
day
when
delivered
to
the
ambassador
seals
unbroken
our
hero
was
in
such
a
transport
of
joy
at
the
sight
of
this
packet
and
his
friend
sir
james
brooke
so
full
of
his
congratulations
that
they
forgot
to
curse
the
ambassador
carelessness
which
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
evil
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
deliver
the
packet
to
ralph
reynolds
old
court
suffolk
but
when
lord
colambre
arrived
at
old
court
suffolk
he
found
all
the
gates
locked
and
no
admittance
to
be
had
at
last
an
old
woman
came
out
of
the
porter
lodge
who
said
reynolds
was
not
there
and
she
could
not
say
where
he
was
after
our
hero
had
opened
her
heart
by
the
present
of
half
a
guinea
she
explained
that
she
not
justly
say
where
he
was
because
that
he
never
let
anybody
of
his
own
people
know
where
he
was
any
day
he
had
several
different
houses
and
places
in
different
parts
and
counties
and
other
shires
as
she
heard
and
by
times
he
was
at
one
and
by
times
at
another
the
names
of
two
of
the
places
toddrington
and
little
wrestham
she
knew
but
there
were
others
to
which
she
could
give
no
direction
he
had
houses
in
odd
parts
of
london
too
that
he
let
and
sometimes
when
the
lodgers
time
was
out
he
would
go
and
be
never
heard
of
for
a
month
maybe
in
one
of
them
in
short
there
was
no
telling
or
saying
where
he
was
or
would
be
one
day
of
the
week
by
where
he
had
been
the
last
when
lord
colambre
expressed
some
surprise
that
an
old
gentleman
as
he
conceived
ralph
reynolds
to
be
should
change
places
so
frequently
the
old
woman
answered
though
her
master
was
a
deal
on
the
wrong
side
of
seventy
and
though
to
look
at
him
you
think
he
was
glued
to
his
chair
and
would
fall
to
pieces
if
he
should
stir
out
of
it
yet
was
as
alert
and
thought
no
more
of
going
about
than
if
he
was
as
young
as
the
gentleman
who
was
now
speaking
to
her
it
was
old
reynolds
delight
to
come
down
and
surprise
his
people
at
his
different
places
and
see
that
they
were
keeping
all
tight
sort
of
a
man
is
he
is
he
a
miser
said
lord
colambre
is
a
miser
and
he
is
not
a
miser
said
the
woman
he
think
as
much
of
the
waste
of
a
penny
as
another
man
would
of
a
hundred
pounds
and
yet
he
would
give
a
hundred
pounds
easier
than
another
would
give
a
penny
when
he
in
the
humour
but
his
humour
is
very
odd
and
there
no
knowing
where
to
have
him
he
and
more
than
a
mule
and
his
deafness
made
him
worse
in
this
because
he
never
heard
what
nobody
said
but
would
say
on
his
own
way
he
was
very
odd
but
not
cracked
no
he
was
as
when
he
took
a
thing
the
right
way
as
any
man
could
be
and
as
clever
and
could
talk
as
well
as
any
member
of
parliament
and
and
where
he
would
take
a
fancy
but
then
maybe
it
would
be
to
a
dog
he
was
remarkable
fond
of
dogs
or
a
cat
or
a
rat
even
that
he
would
take
a
fancy
and
think
more
of
than
he
would
of
a
christian
but
poor
gentleman
there
great
allowance
said
she
be
made
for
him
that
lost
his
son
and
heir
that
would
have
been
heir
to
all
and
a
fine
youth
that
he
doted
upon
but
continued
the
old
woman
in
whose
mind
the
transitions
from
great
to
little
from
serious
to
trivial
were
ludicrously
abrupt
was
no
reason
why
the
old
gentleman
should
scold
me
last
time
he
was
here
as
he
did
for
as
long
as
ever
he
could
stand
over
me
only
because
i
killed
a
mouse
who
was
eating
my
cheese
and
before
night
he
beat
a
boy
for
stealing
a
piece
of
that
same
cheese
and
he
would
never
when
down
here
let
me
set
a
my
good
woman
interrupted
lord
colambre
who
was
little
interested
in
this
affair
of
the
and
nowise
curious
to
learn
more
of
reynolds
domestic
economy
not
trouble
you
any
farther
if
you
can
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
the
road
to
toddrington
or
to
little
wickham
i
think
you
call
it
little
wickham
repeated
the
woman
laughing
bless
you
sir
where
do
you
come
from
it
little
wrestham
surely
everybody
knows
near
lantry
and
keep
the
pike
till
you
come
to
the
turn
at
rotherford
and
then
you
strike
off
into
the
to
the
left
and
then
again
turn
at
the
ford
to
the
right
but
if
you
are
going
to
toddrington
you
do
go
the
road
to
market
which
is
at
the
first
turn
to
the
left
and
the
road
where
there
no
quarter
and
toddrington
lies
but
for
wrestham
you
take
the
road
to
market
it
was
some
time
before
our
hero
could
persuade
the
old
woman
to
stick
to
little
wrestham
or
to
toddrington
and
not
to
mix
the
directions
for
the
different
roads
together
he
took
patience
for
his
impatience
only
confused
his
director
the
more
in
process
of
time
he
made
out
and
wrote
down
the
various
turns
that
he
was
to
follow
to
reach
little
wrestham
but
no
human
power
could
get
her
from
little
wrestham
to
toddrington
though
she
knew
the
road
perfectly
well
but
she
had
for
the
seventeen
last
years
been
used
to
go
other
road
and
all
the
carriers
went
that
way
and
passed
the
door
and
that
was
all
she
could
certify
little
wrestham
after
turning
to
the
left
and
right
as
often
as
his
directory
required
our
hero
happily
reached
but
unhappily
he
found
no
reynolds
there
only
a
steward
who
gave
nearly
the
same
account
of
his
master
as
had
been
given
by
the
old
woman
and
could
not
guess
even
where
the
gentleman
might
now
be
toddrington
was
as
likely
as
any
place
but
he
could
not
say
against
fortune
to
toddrington
our
hero
proceeded
through
roads
such
roads
very
different
from
the
irish
roads
waggon
ruts
into
which
the
carriage
wheels
sunk
nearly
to
the
nave
and
from
time
to
time
of
despond
through
which
it
seemed
impossible
to
drag
walk
wade
or
swim
and
all
the
time
with
a
sulky
postillion
how
unlike
my
larry
thought
lord
colambre
at
length
in
a
very
narrow
lane
going
up
a
hill
said
to
be
two
miles
of
ascent
they
overtook
a
heavy
laden
waggon
and
they
were
obliged
to
go
step
by
step
behind
it
whilst
enjoying
the
gentleman
impatience
much
and
the
postillion
sulkiness
more
the
waggoner
in
his
embroidered
frock
walked
in
state
with
his
long
sceptre
in
his
hand
the
postillion
muttered
not
loud
but
deep
deep
or
loud
no
purpose
would
they
have
answered
the
waggoner
temper
was
proof
against
curse
in
or
out
of
the
english
language
and
from
their
snail
pace
neither
dickens
nor
devil
nor
any
postillion
in
england
could
make
him
put
his
horses
lord
colambre
jumped
out
of
the
chaise
and
walking
beside
him
began
to
talk
to
him
and
spoke
of
his
horses
their
bells
their
trappings
the
beauty
and
strength
of
the
the
value
of
the
whole
team
which
his
lordship
happening
to
guess
right
within
ten
pounds
and
showing
moreover
some
skill
about
and
and
being
fortunately
of
the
waggoner
own
opinion
in
the
great
question
about
conical
and
cylindrical
rims
he
was
pleased
with
the
young
chap
of
a
gentleman
and
in
spite
of
the
chuffiness
of
his
appearance
and
churlishness
of
his
speech
this
waggoner
bosom
made
of
penetrating
stuff
he
determined
to
let
the
gentleman
pass
accordingly
when
up
the
hill
and
the
head
of
the
came
near
an
open
gate
the
waggoner
without
saying
one
word
or
turning
his
head
touched
the
horse
with
his
long
whip
and
the
horse
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
then
came
jeho
and
strange
calls
and
sounds
which
all
the
other
horses
of
the
team
obeyed
and
the
waggon
turned
into
the
farmyard
master
while
i
turn
you
may
pass
the
covering
of
the
waggon
caught
in
the
hedge
as
the
waggon
turned
in
and
as
the
sacking
was
drawn
back
some
of
the
packages
were
disturbed
a
cheese
was
just
rolling
off
on
the
side
next
lord
colambre
he
stopped
it
from
falling
the
direction
caught
his
quick
eye
ralph
reynolds
esq
scratched
out
lion
square
london
written
in
another
hand
below
i
have
found
him
and
surely
i
know
that
hand
said
lord
colambre
to
himself
looking
more
closely
at
the
direction
the
original
direction
was
certainly
in
a
handwriting
well
known
to
him
it
was
lady
dashfort
there
cheese
that
you
looking
at
so
said
the
waggoner
has
been
a
great
traveller
for
it
came
all
the
way
down
from
and
now
it
going
all
the
way
up
again
back
on
account
of
not
finding
the
gentleman
at
home
and
the
man
that
booked
it
told
me
as
how
it
came
from
foreign
parts
lord
colambre
took
down
the
direction
tossed
the
honest
waggoner
a
guinea
wished
him
passed
and
went
on
as
soon
as
he
could
he
turned
into
the
london
road
at
the
first
town
got
a
place
in
the
mail
reached
london
saw
his
father
went
directly
to
his
friend
count
who
was
delighted
when
he
beheld
the
packet
lord
colambre
was
extremely
eager
to
go
immediately
to
old
reynolds
fatigued
as
he
was
for
he
had
travelled
night
and
day
and
had
scarcely
allowed
himself
mind
or
body
one
moment
repose
must
sleep
and
lovers
too
or
they
soon
will
cease
to
be
heroes
or
lovers
said
the
count
rest
perturbed
spirit
this
night
and
morning
we
finish
the
adventure
in
red
lion
square
or
i
will
accompany
you
when
and
where
you
will
if
necessary
to
earth
remotest
bounds
the
next
morning
lord
colambre
went
to
breakfast
with
the
count
the
count
who
was
not
in
love
was
not
up
for
our
hero
was
half
an
hour
earlier
than
the
time
appointed
the
old
servant
ulick
who
had
attended
his
master
to
england
was
very
glad
to
see
lord
colambre
again
and
showing
him
into
the
breakfast
parlour
could
not
help
saying
in
defence
of
his
master
punctuality
clocks
i
suppose
my
lord
are
half
an
hour
faster
than
ours
my
master
will
be
ready
to
the
moment
the
count
soon
appeared
breakfast
was
soon
over
and
the
carriage
at
the
door
for
the
count
sympathised
in
his
young
friend
impatience
as
they
were
setting
out
the
count
large
irish
dog
pushed
out
of
the
house
door
to
follow
them
and
his
master
would
have
forbidden
him
but
lord
colambre
begged
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
accompany
them
for
his
lordship
recollected
the
old
woman
having
mentioned
that
reynolds
was
fond
of
dogs
they
arrived
in
red
lion
square
found
the
house
of
reynolds
and
contrary
to
the
count
prognostics
found
the
old
gentleman
up
and
they
saw
him
in
his
red
at
his
parlour
window
after
some
minutes
running
backwards
and
forwards
of
a
boy
in
the
passage
and
two
or
three
peeps
taken
over
the
blinds
by
the
old
gentleman
they
were
admitted
the
boy
could
not
master
their
names
so
they
were
obliged
reciprocally
to
announce
themselves
and
lord
colambre
the
names
seemed
to
make
no
impression
on
the
old
gentleman
but
he
deliberately
looked
at
the
count
and
his
lordship
as
if
studying
what
rather
than
who
they
were
in
spite
of
the
red
and
a
flowered
reynolds
looked
like
a
gentleman
an
odd
gentleman
but
still
a
gentleman
as
count
came
into
the
room
and
as
his
large
dog
attempted
to
follow
the
count
voice
expressed
shall
i
let
him
in
or
shut
the
door
let
him
in
by
all
means
sir
if
you
please
i
am
fond
of
dogs
and
a
finer
one
i
never
saw
pray
gentlemen
be
seated
said
he
a
portion
of
the
complacency
inspired
by
the
sight
of
the
dog
diffusing
itself
over
his
manner
towards
the
master
of
so
fine
an
animal
and
even
extending
to
the
master
companion
though
in
an
inferior
degree
whilst
reynolds
stroked
the
dog
the
count
told
him
that
dog
was
of
a
curious
breed
now
almost
extinct
the
irish
greyhound
of
which
only
one
nobleman
in
ireland
it
is
said
has
now
a
few
of
the
species
remaining
in
his
possession
now
lie
down
hannibal
said
the
count
reynolds
we
have
taken
the
liberty
though
strangers
of
waiting
upon
you
beg
your
pardon
sir
interrupted
reynolds
did
i
understand
you
rightly
that
a
few
of
the
same
species
are
still
to
be
had
from
one
nobleman
in
ireland
pray
what
is
his
name
said
he
taking
out
his
pencil
the
count
wrote
the
name
for
him
but
observed
that
had
asserted
only
that
a
few
of
these
dogs
remained
in
the
possession
of
that
nobleman
he
could
not
answer
for
it
that
they
were
to
be
had
i
have
ways
and
means
said
old
reynolds
and
rapping
his
and
talking
as
it
was
his
custom
loud
to
himself
dashfort
knows
all
those
irish
lords
she
shall
get
one
for
me
ay
ay
count
replied
as
if
the
words
had
been
addressed
to
him
dashfort
is
in
england
know
it
sir
she
is
in
london
said
reynolds
hastily
do
you
know
of
her
know
sir
that
she
is
not
likely
to
return
to
ireland
and
that
i
am
and
so
is
my
young
friend
here
and
if
the
thing
can
be
accomplished
we
will
get
it
done
for
you
lord
colambre
joined
in
this
promise
and
added
that
the
dog
could
be
obtained
he
would
undertake
to
have
him
safely
sent
over
to
england
gentlemen
i
much
obliged
that
is
when
you
have
done
the
thing
i
shall
be
much
obliged
but
maybe
you
are
only
making
me
civil
speeches
that
sir
said
the
count
smiling
with
much
temper
own
sagacity
and
knowledge
of
the
world
must
enable
you
to
judge
my
own
part
i
can
only
say
cried
lord
colambre
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
being
reproached
with
saying
one
thing
and
meaning
another
i
see
said
old
reynolds
nodding
as
he
looked
at
lord
colambre
added
he
nodding
at
the
count
a
time
for
everything
i
was
hot
once
both
answers
good
for
their
ages
this
speech
lord
colombre
and
the
count
tacitly
agreed
to
consider
as
another
apart
which
they
were
not
to
hear
or
seem
to
hear
the
count
began
again
on
the
business
of
their
visit
as
he
saw
that
lord
colambre
was
boiling
with
impatience
and
feared
that
he
should
boil
over
and
spoil
all
the
count
commenced
with
reynolds
your
name
sounds
to
me
like
the
name
of
a
friend
for
i
had
once
a
friend
of
that
name
i
had
once
the
pleasure
and
a
very
great
pleasure
it
was
to
me
to
be
intimately
acquainted
abroad
on
the
continent
with
a
very
amiable
and
gallant
youth
your
son
care
sir
said
the
old
man
starting
up
from
his
chair
and
instantly
sinking
down
again
care
do
mention
him
to
me
unless
you
would
strike
me
dead
on
the
spot
the
convulsed
motions
of
his
fingers
and
face
worked
for
some
moments
whilst
the
count
and
lord
colambre
much
shocked
and
alarmed
stood
in
silence
the
convulsed
motions
ceased
and
the
old
man
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
as
if
to
relieve
some
sense
of
expression
uncovered
his
gray
hairs
and
after
leaning
back
to
rest
himself
with
his
eyes
fixed
and
in
reverie
for
a
few
moments
he
sat
upright
again
in
his
chair
and
exclaimed
as
he
looked
round
did
not
somebody
say
that
word
who
is
so
cruel
to
say
that
word
before
me
nobody
has
ever
spoken
of
him
to
me
but
once
since
his
death
do
you
know
sir
said
he
fixing
his
eyes
on
count
and
laying
his
cold
hand
on
him
you
know
where
he
was
buried
i
ask
you
sir
do
you
remember
how
he
died
well
too
well
cried
the
count
so
much
affected
as
to
be
scarcely
able
to
pronounce
the
words
died
in
my
arms
i
buried
him
myself
cried
reynolds
do
you
say
so
sir
said
he
studying
the
count
face
with
a
sort
of
bewildered
earnestness
his
body
was
sent
over
to
me
in
a
lead
coffin
and
i
saw
it
and
i
was
asked
and
i
answered
in
the
family
vault
but
the
shock
is
over
said
he
gentlemen
if
the
business
of
your
visit
relates
to
that
subject
i
trust
i
am
now
sufficiently
composed
to
attend
to
you
indeed
i
ought
to
be
prepared
for
i
had
reason
for
years
to
expect
the
stroke
and
yet
when
it
came
it
seemed
sudden
it
stunned
me
put
an
end
to
all
my
worldly
prospects
left
me
childless
without
a
single
descendant
or
relation
near
enough
to
be
dear
to
me
i
am
an
insulated
being
sir
you
are
not
an
insulated
being
said
lord
colambre
have
a
near
relation
who
will
who
must
be
dear
to
you
who
will
make
you
amends
for
all
you
have
lost
all
you
have
suffered
who
will
bring
peace
and
joy
to
your
heart
you
have
a
sir
i
have
no
said
old
reynolds
his
face
and
whole
form
becoming
rigid
with
the
expression
of
obstinacy
have
no
descendant
than
be
forced
to
acknowledge
an
illegitimate
child
lord
i
entreat
as
a
friend
i
command
you
to
be
patient
said
the
count
who
saw
lord
colambre
indignation
suddenly
rise
then
this
is
the
purpose
of
your
visit
continued
old
reynolds
you
come
from
my
enemies
from
the
omars
and
you
are
in
a
league
with
them
continued
old
reynolds
all
this
time
it
is
of
my
eldest
son
you
have
been
talking
sir
replied
the
count
captain
reynolds
who
fell
in
battle
in
the
austrian
service
about
nineteen
years
ago
a
more
gallant
and
amiable
youth
never
lived
pleasure
revived
through
the
dull
look
of
obstinacy
in
the
father
eyes
was
as
you
say
sir
a
gallant
an
amiable
youth
once
and
he
was
my
pride
and
i
loved
him
too
once
but
did
not
you
know
i
had
another
sir
we
did
not
we
are
you
may
perceive
totally
ignorant
of
your
family
and
of
your
affairs
we
have
no
connexion
whatever
or
knowledge
of
any
of
the
st
omars
detest
the
sound
of
the
name
cried
lord
colambre
good
good
well
well
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
a
thousand
times
i
am
a
hasty
very
hasty
old
man
but
i
have
been
harassed
persecuted
hunted
by
wretches
who
got
a
scent
of
my
gold
often
in
my
rage
i
longed
to
throw
my
to
my
pursuers
and
bid
them
leave
me
to
die
in
peace
you
have
feelings
i
see
both
of
you
gentlemen
excuse
me
and
bear
with
my
temper
with
you
much
enforced
the
best
tempers
will
emit
a
hasty
spark
said
the
count
looking
at
lord
colambre
who
was
now
cool
again
and
who
with
a
countenance
full
of
compassion
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
poor
no
not
the
poor
but
the
unhappy
old
man
i
had
another
son
continued
reynolds
on
him
all
my
affections
concentrated
when
i
lost
my
eldest
and
for
him
i
desired
to
preserve
the
estate
which
his
mother
brought
into
my
family
since
you
know
nothing
of
my
affairs
let
me
explain
to
you
that
estate
was
so
settled
that
it
would
have
gone
to
the
child
even
the
daughter
of
my
eldest
son
if
there
had
been
a
legitimate
child
but
i
knew
there
was
no
marriage
and
i
held
out
firm
to
my
opinion
if
there
was
a
marriage
said
i
show
me
the
marriage
certificate
and
i
will
acknowledge
the
marriage
and
acknowledge
the
child
but
they
could
not
and
i
knew
they
could
not
and
i
kept
the
estate
for
my
darling
boy
cried
the
old
gentleman
with
the
exultation
of
successful
positiveness
again
appearing
strong
in
his
physiognomy
but
suddenly
changing
and
relaxing
his
countenance
fell
and
he
added
now
i
have
no
darling
boy
what
use
all
all
must
go
to
the
or
i
must
will
it
to
a
stranger
a
lady
of
quality
who
has
just
found
out
she
is
my
relation
god
knows
how
i
no
genealogist
and
sends
me
irish
cheese
and
iceland
moss
for
my
breakfast
and
her
to
me
oh
i
sick
of
it
all
see
through
it
wish
i
was
blind
wish
i
had
a
where
flatterers
could
not
find
me
pursued
chased
must
change
my
lodgings
again
will
will
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
again
you
were
going
to
tell
me
sir
something
more
of
my
eldest
son
and
how
i
was
led
away
from
the
subject
i
do
know
but
i
meant
only
to
have
assured
you
that
his
memory
was
dear
to
me
till
i
was
so
tormented
about
that
unfortunate
affair
of
his
pretended
marriage
that
at
length
i
hated
to
hear
him
named
but
the
at
last
will
triumph
over
me
my
good
sir
not
if
you
triumph
over
yourself
and
do
justice
cried
lord
colambre
you
listen
to
the
truth
which
my
friend
will
tell
you
and
if
you
will
read
and
believe
the
confirmation
of
it
under
your
son
own
hand
in
this
packet
own
hand
indeed
his
seal
unbroken
but
how
when
where
why
was
it
kept
so
long
and
how
came
it
into
your
hands
count
told
reynolds
that
the
packet
had
been
given
to
him
by
captain
reynolds
on
his
deathbed
related
the
dying
acknowledgment
which
captain
reynolds
had
made
of
his
marriage
and
gave
an
account
of
the
delivery
of
the
packet
to
the
ambassador
who
had
promised
to
transmit
it
faithfully
lord
colambre
told
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
mislaid
and
at
last
recovered
from
among
the
deceased
ambassador
papers
the
father
still
gazed
at
the
direction
and
the
seals
son
handwriting
my
son
seals
but
where
is
the
certificate
of
the
marriage
repeated
he
it
is
withinside
of
this
packet
i
have
done
great
but
i
am
convinced
it
never
was
a
marriage
i
wish
now
it
could
be
proved
only
in
that
case
i
have
for
years
done
great
you
open
the
packet
sir
said
lord
colambre
reynolds
looked
up
at
him
with
a
look
that
said
do
clearly
know
what
interest
you
have
in
all
this
but
unable
to
speak
and
his
hands
trembling
so
that
he
could
scarcely
break
the
seals
he
tore
off
the
cover
laid
the
papers
before
him
sat
down
and
took
breath
lord
colambre
however
impatient
had
now
too
much
humanity
to
hurry
the
old
gentleman
he
only
ran
for
the
spectacles
which
he
espied
on
the
rubbed
them
bright
and
held
them
ready
reynolds
stretched
his
hand
out
for
them
put
them
on
and
the
first
paper
he
opened
was
the
certificate
of
the
marriage
he
read
it
aloud
and
putting
it
down
said
i
acknowledge
the
marriage
i
always
said
if
there
is
a
marriage
there
must
be
a
certificate
and
you
see
now
there
is
a
certificate
i
acknowledge
the
marriage
now
cried
lord
colambre
am
happy
positively
happy
acknowledge
your
sir
acknowledge
miss
nugent
who
sir
miss
reynolds
your
i
ask
no
more

what
you
will
with
your
fortune
now
i
understand
i
begin
to
understand
this
young
gentleman
is
in
love
but
where
is
my
how
shall
i
know
she
is
my
i
have
not
heard
of

since
she
was
an
infant
i
forgot
her
existence
i
have
done
her
great
injustice
knows
nothing
of
it
sir
said
lord
colambre
who
now
entered
into
a
full
explanation
of
miss
nugent
history
and
of
her
connexion
with
his
family
and
of
his
own
attachment
to
her
concluding
the
whole
by
assuring
reynolds
that
his
had
every
virtue
under
heaven
as
to
your
fortune
sir
i
know
that
she
will
as
i
do
say
matter
what
she
will
say
interrupted
old
reynolds
is
she
when
i
see
her
i
shall
hear
what
she
says
tell
me
where
she
is
let
me
see
her
i
long
to
see
whether
there
is
any
likeness
to
her
poor
father
where
is
she
let
me
see
her
immediately
is
one
hundred
and
sixty
miles
off
sir
at
buxton
my
lord
and
what
is
a
hundred
and
sixty
miles
i
suppose
you
think
i
ca
stir
from
my
chair
but
you
are
mistaken
i
think
nothing
of
a
journey
of
a
hundred
and
sixty
miles
i
ready
to
set
off
this
instant
lord
colambre
said
that
he
was
sure
miss
reynolds
would
obey
her
grandfather
slightest
summons
as
it
was
her
duty
to
do
and
would
be
with
him
as
soon
as
possible
if
this
would
be
more
agreeable
to
him
will
write
to
her
instantly
said
his
lordship
you
will
commission
me
my
lord
i
do
not
commission
i
will
go
i
think
nothing
i
say
of
a
journey
of
a
hundred
and
sixty
miles
i
go
and
set
out
morning
lord
colambre
and
the
count
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
result
of
their
visit
now
thought
it
best
to
leave
old
reynolds
at
liberty
to
rest
himself
after
so
many
strong
and
varied
feelings
they
paid
their
parting
compliments
settled
the
time
for
the
next
day
journey
and
were
just
going
to
quit
the
room
when
lord
colambre
heard
in
the
passage
a
voice
the
voice
of
petito
no
my
compliments
and
my
lady
dashfort
best
compliments
and
i
will
call
again
no
cried
old
reynolds
pulling
his
bell
have
no
calling
again
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
let
her
in
now
and
i
see
her
jack
let
in
that
woman
now
or
never
lady
gone
sir
out
of
the
street
door
her
then
now
or
never
tell
her
she
was
in
a
hackney
coach
old
reynolds
jumped
up
and
went
to
the
window
himself
and
seeing
the
hackney
coachman
just
turning
beckoned
at
the
window
and
petito
was
set
down
again
and
ushered
in
by
jack
who
announced
her
as
lady
sir
the
only
lady
he
had
seen
in
that
house
dear
reynolds
i
so
obliged
to
you
for
letting
me
in
cried
petito
adjusting
her
shawl
in
the
passage
and
speaking
in
a
voice
and
manner
well
mimicked
after
her
betters
are
so
very
good
and
kind
and
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
are
not
obliged
to
me
and
i
am
neither
good
nor
kind
said
old
reynolds
strange
man
said
petito
advancing
graceful
in
shawl
drapery
but
she
stopped
short
lord
colambre
and
count
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
did
not
know
petito
was
an
acquaintance
of
yours
gentlemen
said
reynolds
smiling
shrewdly
count
was
too
polite
to
deny
his
acquaintance
with
a
lady
who
challenged
it
by
thus
naming
him
but
he
had
not
the
slightest
recollection
of
her
though
it
seems
he
had
met
her
on
the
stairs
when
he
visited
lady
dashfort
at
killpatrickstown
lord
colambre
was
undeniably
an
old
aquaintance
and
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
from
her
first
natural
start
and
vulgar
exclamation
she
with
very
easy
familiarity
hoped
lady
clonbrony
and
my
lord
and
miss
nugent
and
all
her
friends
in
the
family
were
well
and
said
did
not
know
whether
she
was
to
congratulate
his
lordship
or
not
upon
miss
broadhurst
my
lady
berryl
marriage
but
she
should
soon
have
to
hope
for
his
lordship
congratulations
for
another
marriage
in
her
present
family
lady
isabel
to
colonel
heathcock
who
has
come
in
for
a
large
portion
and
they
are
buying
the
wedding
clothes
sights
of
clothes
and
the
this
day
and
lady
dashfort
and
my
lady
isabel
sent
me
especially
sir
to
you
reynolds
and
to
tell
you
sir
before
anybody
else
and
to
hope
the
cheese
come
safe
up
again
at
last
and
to
ask
whether
the
iceland
moss
agrees
with
your
chocolate
and
is
palatable
it
the
most
diluent
thing
upon
the
universal
earth
and
the
most
tonic
and
fashionable
the
dutches
of
torcaster
takes
it
always
for
breakfast
and
lady
james
too
is
quite
a
convert
and
i
hear
the
duke
of
v
takes
it
too
the
devil
may
take
it
too
for
anything
that
i
care
said
old
reynolds
my
dear
dear
sir
you
are
so
refractory
a
patient
am
no
patient
at
all
and
have
no
patience
either
i
am
as
well
as
you
are
or
my
lady
dashfort
either
and
hope
god
willing
long
to
continue
so
petito
smiled
aside
at
lord
colambre
to
mark
her
perception
of
the
man
strangeness
then
in
a
cajoling
voice
addressing
herself
to
the
old
gentleman
long
i
hope
to
continue
so
if
heaven
grants
my
daily
and
nightly
prayers
and
my
lady
dashfort
also
so
reynolds
if
the
ladies
prayers
are
of
any
avail
you
ought
to
be
purely
and
i
suppose
ladies
prayers
have
the
precedency
in
efficacy
but
it
was
not
of
prayers
and
deathbed
affairs
i
came
commissioned
to
treat
not
of
burials
which
heaven
above
forbid
but
of
weddings
my
diplomacy
was
to
speak
and
to
premise
my
lady
dashfort
would
have
come
herself
in
her
carriage
but
is
hurried
out
of
her
senses
and
my
lady
isabel
could
not
in
proper
modesty
so
they
sent
me
as
their
double
to
hope
you
my
dear
reynolds
who
is
one
of
the
family
relations
will
honour
the
wedding
with
your
presence
would
be
no
honour
and
they
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
said
the
intractable
reynolds
will
be
no
advantage
either
but
that
they
do
not
know
as
well
as
i
do
petito
to
save
you
and
your
lady
all
trouble
about
me
in
future
please
to
let
my
lady
dashfort
know
that
i
have
just
received
and
read
the
certificate
of
my
son
captain
reynolds
marriage
with
miss
omar
i
have
acknowledged
the
marriage
better
late
than
never
and
morning
god
willing
shall
set
out
with
this
young
nobleman
for
buxton
where
i
hope
to
see
and
intend
publicly
to
acknowledge
my
provided
she
will
acknowledge
me
exclaimed
petito
new
turns
are
here
well
sir
i
shall
tell
my
lady
of
the
metamorphoses
that
have
taken
place
though
by
what
magic
as
i
have
not
the
honour
to
deal
in
the
black
art
i
ca
guess
but
since
it
seems
annoying
and
inopportune
i
shall
take
my
finale
and
shall
thus
have
a
verbal
as
you
are
leaving
town
it
seems
for
buxton
so
early
in
the
morning
my
lord
colambre
if
i
see
rightly
into
a
millstone
as
i
hope
and
believe
i
do
on
the
present
occasion
i
have
to
congratulate
your
lordship
have
i
upon
something
like
a
succession
or
a
windfall
in
this
denewment
and
i
beg
you
make
my
humble
respects
acceptable
to
the
miss
grace
nugent
that
was
and
i
wo
derrogate
her
by
any
other
name
in
the
interregnum
as
i
am
persuaded
it
will
only
be
a
temporary
name
scarce
worth
assuming
except
for
the
honour
of
the
public
adoption
and
that
will
i
confident
be
soon
exchanged
for
a
viscount
title
or
i
have
no
sagacity
nor
sympathy
i
hope
i
do
pray
do
let
me
put
you
to
the
blush
my
lord
lord
colambre
would
not
have
let
her
if
he
could
have
helped
it
your
most
obedient
i
had
the
honour
of
meeting
you
at
killpatrickstown
said
petito
backing
to
the
door
and
twitching
her
shawl
she
stumbled
nearly
fell
down
over
the
large
dog
caught
by
the
door
and
recovered
herself
hannibal
rose
and
shook
his
ears
fellow
you
are
of
my
acquaintance
too
she
would
have
stroked
his
head
but
hannibal
walked
off
indignant
and
so
did
she
thus
ended
certain
hopes
for
petito
had
conceived
that
her
diplomacy
might
be
turned
to
account
that
in
her
character
of
an
ambassadress
as
lady
dashfort
double
by
the
aid
of
iceland
moss
in
chocolate
flattery
properly
administered
that
by
bearing
with
all
her
dear
reynolds
oddnesses
and
roughneses
she
might
in
time
that
is
to
say
before
he
made
a
new
will
become
his
dear
petito
or
for
stranger
things
have
happened
and
do
happen
every
day
his
dear
reynolds
petito
however
was
good
at
a
retreat
and
she
flattered
herself
that
at
least
nothing
of
this
underplot
had
appeared
and
at
all
events
she
secured
by
her
services
in
this
embassy
the
object
of
her
ambition
lady
dashfort
scarlet
velvet
gown
yet
a
thread
the
worse
for
the
wear
one
cordial
look
at
this
comforted
her
for
the
loss
of
her
expected
octogenaire
and
she
proceeded
to
discomfit
her
lady
by
repeating
the
message
with
which
strange
old
reynolds
had
charged
her
so
ended
all
lady
dashfort
hopes
of
his
fortune
since
the
death
of
his
youngest
son
she
had
been
indefatigable
in
her
attentions
and
sanguine
in
her
hopes
the
disappointment
affected
both
her
interest
and
her
pride
as
an
intrigante
it
was
necessary
however
to
keep
her
feelings
to
herself
for
if
heathcock
should
hear
anything
of
the
matter
before
the
articles
were
signed
he
might
off
so
she
put
him
and
lady
isabel
into
her
coach
directly
drove
to
gray
to
make
sure
at
all
events
of
the
jewels
in
the
meantime
count
and
lord
colambre
delighted
with
the
result
of
their
visit
took
leave
of
reynolds
after
having
arranged
the
journey
and
appointed
the
hour
for
setting
off
the
next
day
lord
colambre
proposed
to
call
upon
reynolds
in
the
evening
and
introduce
his
father
lord
clonbrony
but
reynolds
said
no
i
not
ceremonious
i
have
given
you
proofs
enough
of
that
i
think
in
the
short
time
we
been
already
acquainted
time
enough
to
introduce
your
father
to
me
when
we
are
in
a
carriage
going
our
journey
then
we
can
talk
and
get
acquainted
but
merely
to
come
this
evening
in
a
hurry
and
say
lord
clonbrony
reynolds
reynolds
lord
clonbrony
and
then
bob
our
two
heads
at
one
another
and
scrape
one
foot
back
and
away
where
the
use
of
that
nonsense
at
my
time
of
life
or
at
any
time
of
life
no
no
we
have
enough
to
do
without
that
i
good
morning
to
you
count
i
thank
you
heartily
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
i
liked
you
lucky
too
that
you
brought
your
dog
with
you
was
hannibal
made
me
first
let
you
in
i
saw
him
over
the
top
of
the
hannibal
my
good
fellow
i
more
obliged
to
you
than
you
can
guess
are
we
all
said
lord
colambre
hannibal
was
well
patted
and
then
they
parted
in
returning
home
they
met
sir
james
brooke
told
you
said
sir
james
should
be
in
london
almost
as
soon
as
you
have
you
found
old
reynolds
come
from
him
does
your
business
prosper
i
hope
as
well
as
mine
a
history
of
all
that
had
passed
up
to
the
present
moment
was
given
and
hearty
congratulations
received
are
you
going
now
sir
james
can
not
you
come
with
us
said
lord
colambre
and
the
count
replied
sir
james
perhaps
you
can
come
with
me
i
going
to
gray
to
give
some
old
family
diamonds
either
to
be
new
set
or
exchanged
count
i
know
you
are
a
judge
of
these
things
pray
come
and
give
me
your
opinion
consult
your
bride
elect
said
the
count
she
knows
little
of
the
matter
and
cares
less
replied
sir
james
so
this
bride
elect
or
i
mistake
her
much
said
the
count
as
they
passed
by
the
window
and
saw
lady
isabel
who
with
lady
dashfort
had
been
holding
consultation
deep
with
the
jeweller
and
heathcock
playing
personnage
muet
lady
dashfort
who
had
always
as
old
reynolds
expressed
it
head
upon
her
shoulders
presence
of
mind
where
her
interests
were
concerned
ran
to
the
door
before
the
count
and
lord
colambre
could
enter
giving
a
hand
to
each
as
if
they
had
all
parted
the
best
friends
in
the
world
do
how
do
give
you
joy
give
me
joy
and
all
that
but
mind
not
a
word
said
she
laying
her
finger
upon
her
lips
a
word
before
heathcock
of
old
reynolds
or
of
the
best
part
of
the
old
fool
his
fortune
the
gentlemen
bowed
in
sign
of
submission
to
her
ladyship
commands
and
comprehended
that
she
feared
heathcock
might
be
off
if
the
best
part
of
his
bride
her
fortune
or
her
expectations
were
lowered
in
value
or
in
prospect
low
is
she
reduced
whispered
lord
colambre
such
a
husband
is
thought
a
prize
and
to
be
secured
by
a
manoeuvre
he
sighed
that
generous
sigh
said
sir
james
brooke
is
wasted
lady
isabel
as
they
approached
turned
from
a
mirror
at
which
she
was
trying
on
a
diamond
crescent
her
face
clouded
at
sight
of
count
and
lord
colambre
and
grew
dark
as
hatred
when
she
saw
sir
james
brooke
she
walked
away
to
the
farther
end
of
the
shop
and
asked
one
of
the
shopmen
the
price
of
a
diamond
necklace
which
lay
upon
the
counter
the
man
said
really
did
not
know
it
belonged
to
lady
oranmore
it
had
just
been
new
set
for
one
of
her
ladyship
daughters
who
is
going
to
be
married
to
sir
james
brooke
one
of
the
gentlemen
my
lady
who
are
just
come
in
then
calling
to
his
master
he
asked
him
the
price
of
the
necklace
he
named
the
value
which
was
considerable
really
thought
lady
oranmore
and
her
daughters
were
vastly
too
philosophical
to
think
of
diamonds
said
lady
isabel
to
her
mother
with
a
sort
of
sentimental
sneer
in
her
voice
and
countenance
it
is
some
comfort
to
me
to
find
in
these
philosophy
and
love
do
not
so
wholly
engross
the
heart
that
they
feel
every
vanity
in
fondness
lost
be
difficult
in
some
cases
thought
many
present
honour
are
cursed
expensive
things
i
know
said
heathcock
be
that
as
it
may
whispered
he
to
the
lady
though
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
others
laid
a
damned
round
wager
that
no
woman
diamonds
married
this
winter
under
a
countess
in
shall
eclipse
lady
isabel
heathcock
and
gray
here
to
be
judge
lady
isabel
paid
for
this
promise
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
with
one
of
those
smiles
which
she
had
formerly
bestowed
upon
lord
colambre
and
which
he
had
once
fancied
expressed
so
much
sensibility
such
discriminative
and
delicate
application
our
hero
felt
so
much
contempt
that
he
never
wasted
another
sigh
of
pity
for
her
degradation
lady
dashfort
came
up
to
him
as
he
was
standing
alone
and
whilst
the
count
and
sir
james
were
settling
about
the
diamonds
lord
colambre
said
she
in
a
low
voice
know
your
thoughts
and
i
could
moralise
as
well
as
you
if
i
did
not
prefer
laughing
you
are
right
enough
and
so
am
i
and
so
is
isabel
we
are
all
right
for
look
here
women
have
not
always
the
liberty
of
choice
and
therefore
they
ca
be
expected
to
have
always
the
power
of
refusal
the
mother
satisfied
with
her
convenient
optimism
got
into
her
carriage
with
her
daughter
her
daughter
diamonds
and
her
precious
her
daughter
companion
for
life
more
i
see
said
count
to
lord
colambre
as
they
left
the
shop
more
i
find
reason
to
congratulate
you
upon
your
escape
my
dear
lord
owe
it
not
to
my
own
wit
or
wisdom
said
lord
colambre
much
to
love
and
much
to
friendship
added
he
turning
to
sir
james
brooke
was
the
friend
who
early
warned
me
against
the
siren
voice
who
before
i
knew
lady
isabel
told
me
what
i
have
since
found
to
be
true
that
passions
alternately
govern
her
fate
br
her
business
is
love
but
her
pleasure
is
hate
br
is
dreadfully
severe
sir
james
said
count
i
am
afraid
it
is
just
am
sure
it
is
just
or
i
would
not
have
said
it
replied
sir
james
brooke
the
foibles
of
the
sex
i
hope
i
have
as
much
indulgence
as
any
man
and
for
the
errors
of
passion
as
much
pity
but
i
can
not
repress
the
indignation
the
abhorrence
i
feel
against
women
cold
and
vain
who
use
their
wit
and
their
charms
only
to
make
others
miserable
lord
colambre
recollected
at
this
moment
lady
isabel
look
and
voice
when
she
declared
that
would
let
her
little
finger
be
cut
off
to
purchase
the
pleasure
of
inflicting
on
lady
de
cresey
for
one
hour
the
torture
of
jealousy
continued
sir
james
brooke
that
i
am
going
to
marry
into
an
irish
family
i
may
feel
with
peculiar
energy
disapprobation
of
this
mother
and
daughter
on
another
account
but
you
lord
colambre
will
do
me
the
justice
to
recollect
that
before
i
had
any
personal
interest
in
the
country
i
expressed
as
a
general
friend
to
ireland
antipathy
to
those
who
return
the
hospitality
they
received
from
a
people
by
publicly
setting
the
example
of
elegant
sentimental
hypocrisy
or
daring
disregard
of
decorum
by
privately
endeavouring
to
destroy
the
domestic
peace
of
families
on
which
at
last
public
as
well
as
private
virtue
and
happiness
depend
i
do
rejoice
my
dear
lord
colambre
to
hear
you
say
that
i
had
any
share
in
saving
you
from
the
siren
and
now
i
will
never
speak
of
these
ladies
more
i
am
sorry
you
can
not
stay
in
town
to
see
but
why
should
i
be
sorry
we
shall
meet
again
i
trust
and
i
shall
introduce
you
and
you
i
hope
will
introduce
me
to
a
very
different
charmer
farewell
you
have
my
warm
good
wishes
wherever
you
go
sir
james
turned
off
quickly
to
the
street
in
which
lady
oranmore
lived
and
lord
colambre
had
not
time
to
tell
him
that
he
knew
and
admired
his
intended
bride
count
promised
to
do
this
for
him
now
said
the
good
count
am
to
take
leave
of
you
and
i
assure
you
i
do
it
with
so
much
reluctance
that
nothing
less
than
positive
engagements
to
stay
in
town
would
prevent
me
from
setting
off
with
you
but
i
shall
be
soon
very
soon
at
liberty
to
return
to
ireland
and
clonbrony
castle
if
you
will
give
me
leave
i
will
see
before
i
see
halloran
castle
lord
colambre
joyfully
thanked
his
friend
for
this
promise
it
is
to
indulge
myself
i
long
to
see
you
happy
long
to
behold
the
choice
of
such
a
heart
as
yours
pray
do
not
steal
a
march
upon
me
let
me
know
in
time
i
will
leave
everything
even
the
siege
of
for
your
wedding
but
i
trust
i
shall
be
in
time
you
will
my
dear
count
if
ever
that
wedding
repeated
the
count
repeated
lord
colambre
which
when
we
last
parted
appeared
to
me
invincible
prevented
my
having
ever
even
attempted
to
make
an
impression
on
the
heart
of
the
woman
i
love
and
if
you
knew
her
count
as
well
as
i
do
you
would
know
that
her
love
could
not
unsought
be
won
that
i
can
not
doubt
or
she
would
not
be
your
choice
but
when
her
love
is
sought
we
have
every
reason
to
hope
said
the
count
smiling
it
may
because
it
ought
to
be
won
by
tried
honour
and
affection
i
only
require
to
be
left
in
hope
i
leave
you
hope
said
lord
colambre
nugent
miss
reynolds
i
should
say
has
been
in
the
habit
of
considering
a
union
with
me
as
impossible
my
mother
early
instilled
this
idea
into
her
mind
miss
nugent
thought
that
duty
forbad
her
to
think
of
me
she
told
me
so
i
have
seen
it
in
all
her
conduct
and
manners
the
barriers
of
habit
the
ideas
of
duty
can
not
ought
not
to
be
thrown
down
or
suddenly
changed
in
a
female
mind
and
you
i
am
sure
know
enough
of
the
best
female
hearts
to
be
aware
that
time
well
let
this
dear
good
charmer
take
her
own
time
provided
there
none
given
to
affectation
or
prudery
or
coquetry
and
from
all
these
of
course
she
must
be
free
and
of
course
i
must
be
content
adieu

revoir
chapter
xvii
as
lord
colambre
was
returning
home
he
was
overtaken
by
sir
terence
my
lord
cried
sir
terence
out
of
breath
have
led
me
a
pretty
dance
all
over
the
town
here
a
letter
somewhere
down
in
my
safe
pocket
for
you
which
has
cost
me
trouble
enough
phoo
where
is
it
now
it
from
miss
nugent
said
he
holding
up
the
letter
the
direction
to
grosvenor
square
london
had
been
scratched
out
and
it
had
been
by
sir
terence
to
the
lord
viscount
colambre
at
sir
james
brooke
brookwood
huntingdonshire
or
elsewhere
with
speed
the
more
haste
the
worse
speed
for
away
it
went
to
brookwood
huntingdonshire
where
i
knew
if
anywhere
you
was
to
be
found
but
as
fate
and
the
post
would
have
it
there
the
letter
went
coursing
after
you
while
you
were
running
round
and
back
and
forwards
and
everywhere
i
understand
to
toddrington
and
wrestham
and
where
not
through
all
them
english
places
where
there
no
so
i
took
it
for
granted
that
it
found
its
way
to
the
office
or
was
sticking
up
across
a
pane
in
the
d
d
postmaster
window
at
huntingdon
for
the
whole
town
to
see
and
it
a
and
some
puppy
to
claim
it
under
false
pretence
and
you
all
the
time
without
it
and
it
might
breed
a
coolness
betwixt
you
and
miss
nugent
my
dear
sir
terence
give
me
the
letter
now
you
have
me
my
dear
lord
if
you
knew
what
a
race
i
have
had
missing
you
here
by
five
minutes
and
there
by
five
seconds
but
i
have
you
at
last
and
you
have
it
and
i
paid
this
minute
for
all
i
liquidated
of
my
substance
by
the
pleasure
i
have
in
seeing
you
crack
the
seal
and
read
it
but
take
care
you
do
tumble
over
the
orange
woman
orange
barrows
are
a
great
nuisance
when
one
studying
a
letter
in
the
streets
of
london
or
the
metropolis
but
never
heed
stick
to
my
arm
and
i
guide
you
like
a
blind
man
safe
through
the
thick
of
them
miss
nugent
letter
which
lord
colambre
read
in
spite
of
the
jostling
of
passengers
and
the
incessant
talking
of
sir
terence
was
as
follows
let
me
not
be
the
cause
of
banishing
you
from
your
home
and
your
country
where
you
would
do
so
much
good
and
make
so
many
happy
let
me
not
be
the
cause
of
your
breaking
your
promise
to
your
mother
of
your
disappointing
my
dear
aunt
so
cruelly
who
has
complied
with
all
our
wishes
and
who
sacrifices
to
oblige
us
her
favourite
tastes
how
could
she
ever
be
happy
in
ireland
how
could
clonbrony
castle
be
a
home
to
her
without
her
son
if
you
take
away
all
she
had
of
amusement
and
pleasure
as
it
is
called
are
not
you
bound
to
give
her
in
their
stead
that
domestic
happiness
which
she
can
enjoy
only
with
you
and
by
your
means
if
instead
of
living
with
her
you
go
into
the
army
she
will
be
in
daily
nightly
anxiety
and
alarm
about
you
and
her
son
will
instead
of
being
a
comfort
be
a
source
of
torment
to
her
i
will
hope
that
you
will
do
now
as
you
have
always
hitherto
done
on
every
occasion
where
i
have
seen
you
act
what
is
right
and
just
and
kind
come
here
on
the
day
you
promised
my
aunt
you
would
before
that
time
i
shall
be
in
cambridgeshire
with
my
friend
lady
berryl
she
is
so
good
as
to
come
to
buxton
for
me
i
shall
remain
with
her
instead
of
returning
to
ireland
i
have
explained
my
reasons
to
my
dear
aunt
could
i
have
any
concealment
from
her
to
whom
from
my
earliest
childhood
i
owe
everything
that
kindness
and
affection
could
give
she
is
satisfied
she
consents
to
my
living
henceforward
with
lady
berryl
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
by
your
conduct
that
you
approve
of
your
affectionate
cousin
and
friend
grace
nugent
this
letter
as
may
be
imagined
by
those
who
like
him
are
capable
of
feeling
honourable
and
generous
conduct
gave
our
hero
exquisite
pleasure
poor
sir
terence
enjoyed
his
lordship
delight
and
forgot
himself
so
completely
that
he
never
even
inquired
whether
lord
colambre
had
thought
of
an
affair
on
which
he
had
spoken
to
him
some
time
before
and
which
materially
concerned
sir
terence
interest
the
next
morning
when
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
and
sir
terence
was
just
taking
leave
of
his
friend
lord
clonbrony
and
actually
in
tears
wishing
them
all
manner
of
happiness
though
he
said
there
was
none
left
now
in
london
or
the
wide
world
even
for
him
lord
colambre
went
up
to
him
and
said
terence
you
have
never
inquired
whether
i
have
done
your
business
my
dear
i
not
thinking
of
that
now
time
enough
by
the
post
i
can
write
after
you
but
my
thoughts
wo
turn
for
me
to
business
now
no
matter
business
is
done
replied
lord
colambre
i
wonder
how
you
could
think
of
it
with
all
you
had
upon
your
mind
and
heart
when
anything
upon
my
heart
good
morning
to
my
head
it
not
worth
a
lemon
to
you
and
thank
you
kindly
and
all
happiness
attend
you
to
you
sir
terence
said
lord
clonbrony
since
it
so
ordered
i
must
live
without
you
you
live
better
without
me
my
lord
i
am
not
a
good
liver
i
know
nor
the
best
of
all
companions
for
a
nobleman
young
or
old
and
now
you
be
rich
and
not
put
to
your
shifts
and
your
wits
what
would
i
have
to
do
for
you
sir
terence
you
know
was
only
the
poor
nobleman
friend
and
you
never
want
to
call
upon
him
again
thanks
to
your
jewel
your
of
a
son
there
so
we
part
here
and
depend
upon
it
you
better
without
me
that
all
my
comfort
or
my
heart
would
break
the
carriage
is
waiting
this
long
time
and
this
young
lover
itching
to
be
off
god
bless
you
both
that
my
last
word
they
called
in
red
lion
square
punctual
to
the
moment
on
old
reynolds
but
his
were
shut
he
had
been
seized
in
the
night
with
a
violent
fit
of
the
gout
which
as
he
said
held
him
fast
by
the
leg
here
said
he
giving
lord
colambre
a
letter
what
will
do
your
business
without
me
take
this
written
acknowledgment
i
have
penned
for
you
and
give
my
her
father
letter
to
read
it
would
touch
a
heart
of
stone
touched
mine
wish
i
could
drag
the
mother
back
out
of
her
grave
to
do
her
justice
all
one
now
you
see
at
last
i
not
a
suspicious
rascal
however
for
i
do
suspect
you
of
palming
a
false
upon
me
you
said
lord
colambre
your
leave
to
come
up
to
town
to
you
sir
you
would
satisfy
yourself
at
least
as
to
what
resemblance
she
may
bear
to
her
father
miss
reynolds
will
come
instantly
and
she
will
nurse
you
no
i
wo
have
her
come
if
she
comes
i
wo
see
her
sha
begin
by
nursing
me
not
selfish
as
soon
as
i
get
rid
of
this
gout
i
shall
be
my
own
man
and
young
again
and
i
soon
be
after
you
across
the
sea
that
sha
stop
me
i
come
to
what
the
name
of
your
place
in
ireland
and
see
what
likeness
i
can
find
to
her
poor
father
in
this
of
mine
that
you
puffed
so
finely
yesterday
and
let
me
see
whether
she
will
wheedle
me
as
finely
as
petito
would
do
get
ready
your
marriage
settlements
do
you
hear
till
you
have
seen
my
will
which
i
shall
sign
at
what
the
name
of
your
place
write
it
down
there
there
pen
and
ink
and
leave
me
for
the
twinge
is
coming
and
i
shall
roar
you
permit
me
sir
to
leave
my
own
servant
with
you
to
take
care
of
you
i
can
answer
for
his
attention
and
fidelity
me
see
his
face
and
i
tell
you
lord
colambre
servant
was
summoned
i
like
his
face
god
bless
you
leave
me
lord
colambre
gave
his
servant
a
charge
to
bear
with
reynolds
rough
manner
and
temper
and
to
pay
the
poor
old
gentleman
every
possible
attention
then
our
hero
proceeded
with
his
father
on
his
journey
and
on
this
journey
nothing
happened
worthy
of
note
on
his
first
perusal
of
the
letter
from
grace
lord
colambre
had
feared
that
she
would
have
left
buxton
with
lady
berryl
before
he
could
reach
it
but
upon
recollection
he
hoped
that
the
few
lines
he
had
written
addressed
to
his
mother
and
miss
nugent
with
the
assurance
that
he
should
be
with
them
on
wednesday
would
be
sufficient
to
show
her
that
some
great
change
had
happened
and
consequently
sufficient
to
prevent
her
from
quitting
her
aunt
till
she
could
know
whether
such
a
separation
would
be
necessary
he
argued
wisely
more
wisely
than
grace
had
reasoned
for
notwithstanding
this
note
she
would
have
left
buxton
before
his
arrival
but
for
lady
berryl
strength
of
mind
and
positive
determination
not
to
set
out
with
her
till
lord
colambre
should
arrive
to
explain
in
the
interval
poor
grace
was
indeed
in
an
anxious
state
of
suspense
and
her
uncertainty
whether
she
was
doing
right
or
wrong
by
staying
to
see
lord
colambre
tormented
her
most
dear
you
can
not
help
yourself
be
quiet
said
lady
berryl
will
take
the
whole
upon
my
conscience
and
i
hope
my
conscience
may
never
have
anything
worse
to
answer
for
grace
was
the
first
person
who
from
her
window
saw
lord
colambre
the
instant
the
carriage
drove
to
the
door
she
ran
to
her
friend
lady
berryl
apartment
is
come
now
take
me
away
yet
my
sweet
friend
lie
down
upon
this
sofa
if
you
please
and
keep
yourself
tranquil
whilst
i
go
and
see
what
you
ought
to
do
and
depend
upon
me
for
a
true
friend
in
whose
mind
as
in
your
own
duty
is
the
first
object
depend
on
you
entirely
said
grace
sinking
down
on
the
sofa
you
see
i
obey
you
thanks
to
you
for
lying
down
when
you
ca
stand
lady
berryl
went
to
lady
clonbrony
apartment
she
was
met
by
sir
arthur
my
love
come
quick
lord
colambre
is
arrived
know
it
and
does
he
go
to
ireland
speak
instantly
that
i
may
tell
grace
nugent
can
tell
her
nothing
yet
my
love
for
we
know
nothing
lord
colambre
will
not
say
a
word
till
you
come
but
i
know
by
his
countenance
that
he
has
good
and
extraordinary
news
they
passed
rapidly
along
the
passage
to
lady
clonbrony
room
my
dear
dear
lady
berryl
come
or
i
shall
die
with
impatience
cried
lady
clonbrony
in
a
voice
and
manner
between
laughing
and
crying
now
you
have
congratulated
are
very
happy
and
very
glad
and
all
that
now
for
mercy
sake
sit
down
lord
clonbrony
for
heaven
sake
sit
down
beside
me
here
or
anywhere
now
colambre
begin
and
tell
us
all
at
once
but
as
nothing
is
so
tedious
as
a
tale
lord
colambre
narrative
need
not
here
be
repeated
he
began
with
count
visit
immediately
after
lady
clonbrony
had
left
london
and
went
through
the
history
of
the
discovery
that
captain
reynolds
was
the
husband
of
miss
omar
and
the
father
of
grace
the
dying
acknowledgment
of
his
marriage
the
packet
delivered
by
count
to
the
careless
ambassador
how
recovered
by
the
assistance
of
his
executor
sir
james
brooke
the
travels
from
wrestham
to
toddrington
and
thence
to
red
lion
square
the
interview
with
old
reynolds
and
its
final
result
all
was
related
as
succinctly
as
the
impatient
curiosity
of
lord
colambre
auditors
could
desire
wonder
upon
wonder
and
joy
upon
joy
cried
lady
clonbrony
my
darling
grace
is
as
legitimate
as
i
am
and
an
heiress
after
all
where
is
she
where
is
she
in
your
room
lady
berryl
oh
colambre
why
would
you
let
her
be
by
lady
berryl
do
you
know
he
would
not
let
me
send
for
her
though
she
was
the
person
of
all
others
most
concerned
that
very
reason
and
that
lord
colambre
was
quite
right
i
am
sure
you
must
be
sensible
when
you
recollect
that
grace
has
no
idea
that
she
is
not
the
daughter
of
nugent
she
has
no
suspicion
that
the
breath
of
blame
ever
lighted
upon
her
mother
this
part
of
the
story
can
not
be
announced
to
her
with
too
much
caution
and
indeed
her
mind
has
been
so
much
harassed
and
agitated
and
she
is
at
present
so
far
from
strong
that
great
delicacy
very
true
lady
berryl
interrupted
lady
clonbrony
i
be
as
delicate
as
you
please
about
it
afterwards
but
in
the
first
and
foremost
place
i
must
tell
her
the
best
part
of
the
story
that
she
an
heiress
madam
never
killed
anybody
so
darting
through
all
opposition
lady
clonbrony
made
her
way
into
the
room
where
grace
was
lying
get
up
get
up
my
own
grace
and
be
surprised
well
you
may
you
are
an
heiress
after
all
i
my
dear
aunt
said
grace
as
i
lady
clonbrony
and
a
very
great
heiress
and
no
more
colambre
cousin
than
lady
berryl
here
so
now
begin
and
love
him
as
fast
as
you
please
i
give
my
consent
and
here
he
is
lady
clonbrony
turned
to
her
son
who
just
appeared
at
the
door
mother
what
have
you
done
have
i
done
cried
lady
clonbrony
following
her
son
eyes
bless
me
grace
fainted
dead
lady
berryl
oh
what
have
i
done
my
dear
lady
berryl
what
shall
we
do
her
colour
coming
again
said
lord
clonbrony
away
my
dear
lady
clonbrony
for
the
present
and
so
will
i
though
i
long
to
talk
to
the
darling
girl
myself
but
she
is
not
equal
to
it
yet
when
grace
came
to
herself
she
first
saw
lady
berryl
leaning
over
her
and
raising
herself
a
little
she
said
has
happened
i
do
know
yet
i
do
know
whether
i
am
happy
or
not
then
seeing
lord
colambre
she
sat
quite
upright
received
my
letter
cousin
i
hope
do
you
go
to
ireland
with
my
aunt
and
with
you
i
hope
my
beloved
friend
said
colambre
once
assured
me
that
i
had
such
a
share
of
your
esteem
and
affection
that
the
idea
of
my
accompanying
you
to
ireland
was
not
disagreeable
to
you
you
flattered
me
that
i
formed
part
of
your
agreeable
associations
with
home
sit
down
by
me
wo
you
my
dear
lady
berryl
but
then
i
considered
you
as
my
cousin
lord
colambre
and
i
thought
you
felt
the
same
towards
me
but
now
now
my
charming
grace
said
lord
colambre
kneeling
beside
her
and
taking
her
hand
invincible
obstacle
opposes
my
passion
no
invincible
obstacle
did
i
say
let
me
hope
that
i
may
say
no
obstacle
but
what
depends
on
the
change
in
the
nature
of
your
sentiments
you
heard
my
mother
consent
you
saw
her
joy
scarcely
knew
what
i
heard
or
saw
said
grace
blushing
deeply
what
i
now
see
and
hear
but
of
this
i
feel
secure
before
i
comprehend
the
mystery
before
you
explain
to
me
the
causes
of
your
change
of
conduct
that
you
have
never
been
actuated
by
caprice
but
governed
by
wise
and
honourable
motives
as
to
my
going
to
ireland
or
remaining
with
lady
berryl
she
has
heard
all
the
circumstances
she
is
my
friend
and
yours
a
better
friend
can
not
be
to
her
i
appeal
she
will
decide
for
me
what
i
ought
to
do
she
promised
to
take
me
from
hence
instantly
if
i
ought
to
go
did
and
i
would
do
so
without
hesitation
if
any
duty
or
any
prudence
required
it
but
after
having
heard
all
the
circumstances
i
can
only
tell
you
that
i
willingly
resign
the
pleasure
of
your
company
tell
her
my
dear
lady
berryl
said
lord
colambre
friend
as
you
are
explain
to
her
you
can
better
than
any
of
us
all
that
is
to
be
known
let
her
know
my
whole
conduct
and
then
let
her
decide
for
herself
and
i
shall
submit
to
her
decision
it
is
difficult
my
dear
grace
to
restrain
the
expression
of
love
of
passion
such
as
i
feel
but
i
have
some
power
over
myself
you
know
it
and
this
i
can
promise
you
that
your
affections
shall
be
free
as
air
that
no
wishes
of
friends
no
interference
nothing
but
your
own
unbiassed
choice
will
i
allow
if
my
life
depended
upon
it
to
operate
in
my
favour
be
assured
my
dearest
grace
added
he
smiling
as
he
retired
shall
have
time
to
know
whether
you
are
happy
or
not
the
moment
he
had
left
the
room
she
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
her
friend
and
her
heart
oppressed
with
various
feelings
was
relieved
by
tears
a
species
of
relief
to
which
she
was
not
habituated
am
happy
said
she
what
was
the
invincible
obstacle
what
was
the
meaning
of
my
aunt
words
and
what
was
the
cause
of
her
joy
explain
all
this
to
me
my
dear
friend
for
i
am
still
as
if
i
were
in
a
dream
with
all
the
delicacy
which
lady
clonbrony
deemed
superfluous
lady
berryl
explained
nothing
could
surpass
the
astonishment
of
grace
on
first
learning
that
nugent
was
not
her
father
when
she
was
told
of
the
stigma
that
had
been
cast
on
her
birth
the
suspicions
the
disgrace
to
which
her
mother
had
been
subjected
for
so
many
years
that
mother
whom
she
had
so
loved
and
respected
who
had
with
such
care
instilled
into
the
mind
of
her
daughter
the
principles
of
virtue
and
religion
that
mother
whom
grace
had
always
seen
the
example
of
every
virtue
she
taught
on
whom
her
daughter
never
suspected
that
the
touch
of
blame
the
breath
of
scandal
could
rest
grace
could
express
her
sensations
only
by
repeating
in
tones
of
astonishment
pathos
indignation
mother
my
mother
my
mother
for
some
time
she
was
incapable
of
attending
to
any
other
idea
or
of
feeling
any
other
sensations
when
her
mind
was
able
to
admit
the
thought
her
friend
soothed
her
by
recalling
the
expressions
of
lord
colambre
love
the
struggle
by
which
he
had
been
agitated
when
he
fancied
a
union
with
her
opposed
by
an
invincible
obstacle
grace
sighed
and
acknowledged
that
in
prudence
it
ought
to
have
been
an
invincible
obstacle
she
admired
the
firmness
of
his
decision
the
honour
with
which
he
had
acted
towards
her
one
moment
she
exclaimed
if
i
had
been
the
daughter
of
a
mother
who
had
conducted
herself
ill
he
never
would
have
trusted
me
the
next
moment
she
recollected
with
pleasure
the
joy
she
had
just
seen
in
his
eyes
the
affection
the
passion
that
spoke
in
every
word
and
look
then
dwelt
upon
the
sober
certainty
that
all
obstacles
were
removed
no
duty
opposes
my
loving
him
and
my
aunt
wishes
it
my
kind
aunt
and
i
may
think
of
you
my
best
friend
would
not
assure
me
of
this
if
you
were
not
certain
of
the
oh
how
can
i
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
and
for
that
best
of
all
kindness
sympathy
you
see
your
calmness
your
strength
of
mind
supports
and
tranquillises
me
i
would
rather
have
heard
all
i
have
just
learnt
from
you
than
from
any
other
person
living
i
could
not
have
borne
it
from
any
one
else
no
one
else
knows
my
mind
so
perfectly
yet
my
aunt
is
very
good
and
my
dear
uncle
should
not
i
go
to
him
but
he
is
not
my
uncle
she
is
not
my
aunt
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
think
that
they
are
not
my
relations
and
that
i
am
nothing
to
them
may
be
everything
to
them
my
dear
grace
said
lady
berryl
you
please
you
may
be
their
daughter
grace
blushed
and
smiled
and
sighed
and
was
consoled
but
then
she
recollected
her
new
relation
reynolds
her
grandfather
whom
she
had
never
seen
who
had
for
years
disowned
her
treated
her
mother
with
injustice
she
could
scarcely
think
of
him
with
complaisancy
yet
when
his
age
his
sufferings
his
desolate
state
were
represented
she
pitied
him
and
faithful
to
her
strong
sense
of
duty
would
have
gone
instantly
to
offer
him
every
assistance
and
attention
in
her
power
lady
berryl
assured
her
that
reynolds
had
positively
forbidden
her
going
to
him
and
that
he
had
assured
lord
colambre
he
would
not
see
her
if
she
went
to
him
after
such
rapid
and
varied
emotions
poor
grace
desired
repose
and
her
friend
took
care
that
it
should
be
secured
to
her
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
the
meantime
lord
clonbrony
had
kindly
and
judiciously
employed
his
lady
in
a
discussion
about
certain
velvet
furniture
which
grace
had
painted
for
the
at
clonbrony
castle
in
lady
clonbrony
mind
as
in
some
bad
paintings
there
was
no
keeping
all
objects
great
and
small
were
upon
the
same
level
the
moment
her
son
entered
the
room
her
ladyship
exclaimed
pleasant
at
once
here
your
father
tells
me
grace
velvet
furniture
all
packed
really
soho
the
best
man
in
the
world
of
his
kind
and
the
cleverest
and
so
after
all
my
dear
colambre
as
i
always
hoped
and
prophesied
at
last
you
will
marry
an
heiress
terry
said
lord
clonbrony
win
his
wager
from
mordicai
repeated
lady
clonbrony
odious
terry
i
hope
my
lord
that
he
is
not
to
be
one
of
my
comforts
in
ireland
my
dear
mother
he
is
much
better
provided
for
than
we
could
have
expected
one
of
my
father
first
objects
was
to
prevent
him
from
being
any
encumbrance
to
you
we
consulted
him
as
to
the
means
of
making
him
happy
and
the
knight
acknowledged
that
he
had
long
been
casting
a
sheep
eye
at
a
little
snug
place
that
will
soon
be
open
in
his
native
country
the
chair
of
assistant
barrister
at
the
sessions
assistant
barrister
said
my
father
but
my
dear
terry
you
have
all
your
life
been
evading
the
laws
and
very
frequently
breaking
the
peace
do
you
think
this
has
qualified
you
peculiarly
for
being
a
guardian
of
the
laws
sir
terence
replied
yes
sure
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
is
no
bad
maxim
and
did
not
colquhoun
the
scotchman
get
himself
made
a
great
justice
by
his
making
all
the
world
as
wise
as
himself
about
thieves
of
all
sorts
by
land
and
by
water
and
in
the
air
too
where
he
detected
the
and
is
not
barrington
of
botany
bay
father
now
began
to
be
seriously
alarmed
lest
sir
terence
should
insist
upon
his
using
his
interest
to
make
him
an
assistant
barrister
he
was
not
aware
that
five
years
practice
at
the
bar
was
a
necessary
accomplishment
for
this
office
when
fortunately
for
all
parties
my
good
friend
count
helped
us
out
of
the
difficulty
by
starting
an
idea
full
of
practical
justice
a
literary
friend
of
the
count
had
been
for
some
time
promised
a
lucrative
situation
under
government
but
unfortunately
he
was
a
man
of
so
much
merit
and
ability
that
they
could
not
find
employment
for
him
at
home
and
they
gave
him
a
commission
i
should
rather
say
a
contract
abroad
for
supplying
the
army
with
hungarian
horses
now
the
gentleman
had
not
the
slightest
skill
in
horseflesh
and
as
sir
terence
is
a
complete
jockey
the
count
observed
that
he
would
be
the
best
possible
deputy
for
his
literary
friend
we
warranted
him
to
be
a
thoroughgoing
friend
and
i
do
think
the
coalition
will
be
well
for
both
parties
the
count
has
settled
it
all
and
i
left
sir
terence
comfortably
provided
for
out
of
your
way
my
dear
mother
and
as
happy
as
he
could
be
when
parting
from
my
father
lord
colambre
was
assiduous
in
engaging
his
mother
attention
upon
any
subject
which
could
for
the
present
draw
her
thoughts
away
from
her
young
friend
but
at
every
pause
in
the
conversation
her
ladyship
repeated
grace
is
an
heiress
after
all
so
after
all
they
know
they
are
not
cousins
well
i
prefer
grace
a
thousand
times
over
to
any
other
heiress
in
england
no
obstacle
no
objection
they
have
my
consent
i
always
prophesied
colambre
would
marry
an
heiress
but
why
not
marry
directly
her
ardour
and
impatience
to
hurry
things
forward
seemed
now
likely
to
retard
the
accomplishment
of
her
own
wishes
and
lord
clonbrony
who
understood
rather
more
of
the
passion
of
love
than
his
lady
ever
had
felt
or
understood
saw
the
agony
into
which
she
threw
her
son
and
felt
for
his
darling
grace
with
a
degree
of
delicacy
and
address
of
which
few
would
have
supposed
lord
clonbrony
capable
his
lordship
with
his
son
in
endeavours
to
keep
lady
clonbrony
quiet
and
to
suppress
the
hourly
thanksgivings
of
grace
turning
out
an
heiress
on
one
point
however
she
vowed
she
would
not
be
overruled
she
would
have
a
splendid
wedding
at
clonbrony
castle
such
as
should
become
an
heir
and
heiress
and
the
wedding
she
hoped
would
be
immediately
on
their
return
to
ireland
she
should
announce
the
thing
to
her
friends
directly
on
her
arrival
at
clonbrony
castle
dear
said
lord
clonbrony
must
wait
in
the
first
place
the
pleasure
of
old
reynolds
fit
of
the
gout
that
true
because
of
his
will
said
her
ladyship
a
will
soon
made
is
not
it
that
ca
be
much
delay
then
there
must
be
settlements
said
lord
clonbrony
take
time
lovers
like
all
the
rest
of
mankind
must
submit
to
the
law
delay
in
the
meantime
my
dear
as
these
buxton
baths
agree
with
you
so
well
and
as
grace
does
not
seem
to
be
over
and
above
strong
for
travelling
a
long
journey
and
as
there
are
many
curious
and
beautiful
scenes
of
nature
here
in
derbyshire
matlock
and
the
wonders
of
the
peak
and
so
on
which
the
young
people
would
be
glad
to
see
together
and
may
not
have
another
opportunity
soon
why
not
rest
ourselves
a
little
for
another
reason
too
continued
his
lordship
bringing
together
as
many
arguments
as
he
could
for
he
had
often
found
that
though
lady
clonbrony
was
a
match
for
any
single
argument
her
understanding
could
be
easily
overpowered
by
a
number
of
whatever
sort
my
dear
here
sir
arthur
and
lady
berryl
come
to
buxton
on
purpose
to
meet
us
and
we
owe
them
some
compliment
and
something
more
than
compliment
i
think
so
i
do
see
why
we
should
be
in
a
hurry
to
leave
them
or
quit
buxton
a
few
weeks
sooner
or
later
ca
signify
and
clonbrony
castle
will
be
getting
all
the
while
into
better
order
for
us
burke
is
gone
down
there
and
if
we
stay
here
quietly
there
will
be
time
for
the
velvet
furniture
to
get
there
before
us
and
to
be
unpacked
and
up
in
the
true
my
lord
said
lady
clonbrony
there
is
a
great
deal
of
reason
in
all
you
say
so
i
second
that
motion
as
colambre
i
see
subscribes
to
it
they
stayed
some
time
in
derbyshire
and
every
day
lord
clonbrony
proposed
some
pleasant
excursion
and
contrived
that
the
young
people
should
be
left
to
themselves
as
broadhurst
used
so
strenuously
to
advise
the
recollection
of
whose
authoritative
maxims
fortunately
still
operated
upon
lady
clonbrony
to
the
great
ease
and
advantage
of
the
lovers
happy
as
a
lover
a
friend
a
son
happy
in
the
consciousness
of
having
restored
a
father
to
respectability
and
persuaded
a
mother
to
quit
the
feverish
joys
of
fashion
for
the
pleasures
of
domestic
life
happy
in
the
hope
of
winning
the
whole
heart
of
the
woman
he
loved
and
whose
esteem
he
knew
he
possessed
and
deserved
happy
in
developing
every
day
every
hour
fresh
charm
in
his
destined
bride
we
leave
our
hero
returning
to
his
native
country
and
we
leave
him
with
the
reasonable
expectation
that
he
will
support
through
life
the
promise
of
his
early
character
that
his
patriotic
views
will
extend
with
his
power
to
carry
wishes
into
action
that
his
attachment
to
his
countrymen
will
still
increase
upon
further
acquaintance
and
that
he
will
long
diffuse
happiness
through
the
wide
circle
which
is
peculiarly
subject
to
the
influence
and
example
of
a
great
resident
irish
proprietor
letter
from
larry
to
his
brother
pat
brady
at
mordicai
coachmaker
london
my
dear
brother
yours
of
the
inclosing
the
five
pound
note
for
my
father
came
safe
to
hand
monday
last
and
with
his
thanks
and
blessing
to
you
he
commends
it
to
you
herewith
inclosed
back
again
on
account
of
his
being
in
no
immediate
necessity
nor
likelihood
to
want
in
future
as
you
shall
hear
forthwith
but
wants
you
over
with
all
speed
and
the
note
will
answer
for
travelling
charges
for
we
ca
enjoy
the
luck
it
has
pleased
god
to
give
us
without
yees
put
the
rest
in
your
pocket
and
read
it
when
you
time
old
nick
gone
and
dennis
along
with
him
to
the
place
he
come
from
praise
be
to
god
the
ould
lord
has
found
him
out
in
his
tricks
and
i
helped
him
to
that
through
the
young
lord
that
i
driv
as
i
informed
you
in
my
last
when
he
was
a
welchman
which
was
the
best
turn
ever
i
did
though
i
did
not
know
it
no
more
than
adam
that
time
so
ould
nick
turned
out
of
the
agency
clean
and
clear
and
the
day
after
it
was
known
there
was
surprising
great
joy
through
the
whole
country
not
surprising
either
but
just
what
you
might
knowing
him
rasonably
expect
he
that
is
old
nick
and
dennis
would
have
been
burnt
that
night
i
mane
in
effigy
through
the
town
of
clonbrony
but
that
the
new
man
burke
come
down
that
day
too
soon
to
stop
it
and
said
was
not
becoming
to
trample
on
the
fallen
or
something
that
way
that
put
an
end
to
it
and
though
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
many
and
to
me
in
particular
i
could
not
but
like
the
jantleman
the
better
for
it
anyhow
they
say
he
is
a
very
good
jantleman
and
as
unlike
old
nick
or
the
saint
as
can
be
and
takes
no
duty
fowl
nor
glove
nor
nor
asks
duty
work
nor
duty
turf
well
when
i
was
disappointed
of
the
effigy
i
comforted
myself
by
making
a
bonfire
of
old
nick
big
rick
of
duty
turf
which
by
great
luck
was
out
in
the
road
away
from
all
or
thatch
or
yards
to
take
fire
so
no
danger
in
life
or
objection
and
such
another
blaze
i
wished
you
seed
it
and
all
the
men
women
and
children
in
the
town
and
country
far
and
near
gathered
round
it
shouting
and
dancing
like
mad
and
it
was
light
as
day
quite
across
the
bog
as
far
as
bartley
finnigan
house
and
i
heard
after
they
seen
it
from
all
parts
of
the
three
counties
and
they
thought
it
was
john
eve
in
a
mistake
or
could
make
out
what
it
was
but
all
took
it
in
good
part
for
a
good
sign
and
were
in
great
joy
as
for
dennis
and
ould
nick
an
attorney
had
his
foot
upon
em
with
an
habere
a
latitat
and
three
executions
hanging
over
and
there
the
end
of
rogues
and
a
great
example
in
the
country
and
no
more
about
it
for
i
ca
be
wasting
more
ink
upon
them
that
do
desarve
it
at
my
hands
when
i
want
it
for
them
that
do
you
shall
see
so
some
weeks
past
and
there
was
great
cleaning
at
clonbrony
castle
and
in
the
town
of
clonbrony
and
the
new
agent
smart
and
clever
and
he
had
the
glaziers
and
the
painters
and
the
slaters
up
and
down
in
the
town
wherever
wanted
and
you
would
know
it
again
thinks
i
this
is
no
bad
sign
now
cock
up
your
ears
pat
for
the
great
news
is
coming
and
the
good
the
master
come
home
long
life
to
him
and
family
come
home
yesterday
all
entirely
the
ould
lord
and
the
young
lord
ay
there
the
man
paddy
and
my
lady
and
miss
nugent
and
i
driv
miss
nugent
maid
that
maid
that
was
and
another
so
i
had
the
luck
to
be
in
it
along
wid
and
see
all
from
first
to
last
and
first
i
must
tell
you
my
young
lord
colambre
remembered
and
noticed
me
the
minute
he
lit
at
our
inn
and
condescended
to
beckon
at
me
out
of
the
yard
to
him
and
axed
me
larry
says
he
you
keep
your
promise
oath
again
the
whisky
is
it
says
i
lord
i
surely
did
said
i
which
was
true
as
all
the
country
knows
i
never
tasted
a
drop
since
i
proud
to
see
your
honour
my
lord
as
good
as
your
word
too
and
back
again
among
us
so
then
there
was
a
call
for
the
horses
and
no
more
at
that
time
passed
betwix
my
young
lord
and
me
but
that
he
pointed
me
out
to
the
ould
one
as
i
went
off
i
noticed
and
thanked
him
for
it
in
my
heart
though
i
did
not
know
all
the
good
was
to
come
of
it
well
no
more
of
myself
for
the
present
ogh
it
i
driv
well
and
we
all
got
to
the
great
gate
of
the
park
before
sunset
and
as
fine
an
evening
as
ever
you
see
with
the
sun
shining
on
the
tops
of
the
trees
as
the
ladies
noticed
the
leaves
changed
but
not
dropped
though
so
late
in
the
season
i
believe
the
leaves
knew
what
they
were
about
and
kept
on
on
purpose
to
welcome
them
and
the
birds
were
singing
and
i
stopped
whistling
that
they
might
hear
them
but
sorrow
bit
could
they
hear
when
they
got
to
the
park
gate
for
there
was
such
a
crowd
and
such
a
shout
as
you
never
see
and
they
had
the
horses
off
every
carriage
entirely
and
home
with
blessings
through
the
park
and
god
bless
when
they
got
out
they
did
go
shut
themselves
up
in
the
great
but
went
straight
out
to
the
tirrass
to
satisfy
the
eyes
and
hearts
that
followed
them
my
lady
laning
on
my
young
lord
and
miss
grace
nugent
that
was
the
beautifullest
angel
that
ever
you
set
eyes
on
with
the
finest
complexion
and
sweetest
of
smiles
laning
upon
the
ould
lord
arm
who
had
his
hat
off
bowing
to
all
and
noticing
the
old
tenants
as
he
passed
by
name
oh
there
was
great
gladness
and
tears
in
the
midst
for
joy
i
could
scarce
keep
from
myself
after
a
turn
or
two
upon
the
tirrass
my
lord
colambre
quit
his
mother
arm
for
a
minute
and
he
come
to
the
edge
of
the
slope
and
looked
down
and
through
all
the
crowd
for
some
one
it
the
widow
my
lord
says
i
yonder
with
the
spectacles
on
her
nose
betwixt
her
son
and
daughter
as
usual
then
my
lord
beckoned
and
they
did
not
know
which
of
the
tree
would
stir
and
then
he
gave
tree
beckons
with
his
own
finger
and
they
all
tree
came
fast
enough
to
the
bottom
of
the
slope
forenent
my
lord
and
he
went
down
and
helped
the
widow
up
oh
he
the
true
jantleman
and
brought
all
tree
up
on
the
tirrass
to
my
lady
and
miss
nugent
and
i
was
up
close
after
that
i
might
hear
which
was
manners
but
i
could
help
it
so
what
he
said
i
do
well
know
for
i
could
not
get
near
enough
after
all
but
i
saw
my
lady
smile
very
kind
and
take
the
widow
by
the
hand
and
then
my
lord
colambre
grace
to
miss
nugent
and
there
was
the
word
namesake
and
something
about
a
check
curtains
but
whatever
it
was
they
was
all
greatly
pleased
then
my
lord
colambre
turned
and
looked
for
brian
who
had
fell
back
and
took
him
with
some
commendation
to
my
lord
his
father
and
my
lord
the
master
said
which
i
did
know
till
after
that
they
should
have
their
house
and
farm
at
the
ould
rent
and
at
the
surprise
the
widow
dropped
down
dead
and
there
was
a
cry
as
for
ten
berrings
says
i
only
kilt
for
joy
and
i
went
and
lift
her
up
for
her
son
had
no
more
strength
that
minute
than
the
child
new
born
and
grace
trembled
like
a
leaf
as
white
as
the
sheet
but
not
long
for
the
mother
came
to
and
was
as
well
as
ever
when
i
brought
some
water
which
miss
nugent
handed
to
her
with
her
own
hand
was
always
pretty
and
good
said
the
widow
laying
her
hand
upon
miss
nugent
kind
and
good
to
me
and
mine
that
minute
there
was
music
from
below
the
blind
harper
with
his
harp
that
struck
up
nugent
and
that
finished
and
my
lord
colambre
smiling
with
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
too
and
the
ould
lord
quite
wiping
his
i
ran
to
the
tirrass
brink
to
bid
play
it
again
but
as
i
run
i
thought
i
heard
a
voice
call
larry
calls
larry
says
i
lord
colambre
calls
you
larry
says
all
at
once
and
four
takes
me
by
the
shoulders
and
spins
me
round
my
young
lord
calling
you
larry
run
for
your
life
so
i
run
back
for
my
life
and
walked
respectful
with
my
hat
in
my
hand
when
i
got
near
on
your
hat
my
father
desires
it
says
my
lord
colambre
the
ould
lord
made
a
sign
to
that
purpose
but
was
too
full
to
speak
your
father
continues
my
young
he
very
ould
my
lord
says
i
did
ask
you
how
ould
he
was
says
he
where
is
he
behind
the
crowd
below
on
account
of
his
infirmities
he
could
walk
so
fast
as
the
rest
my
lord
says
i
his
heart
is
with
you
if
not
his
body
must
have
his
body
too
so
bring
him
bodily
before
us
and
this
shall
be
your
warrant
for
so
doing
said
my
lord
joking
for
he
knows
the
natur
of
us
paddy
and
how
we
love
a
joke
in
our
hearts
as
well
as
if
he
had
lived
all
his
life
in
ireland
and
by
the
same
token
will
for
that
rason
do
what
he
pleases
with
us
and
more
maybe
than
a
man
twice
as
good
that
never
would
smile
on
us
but
i
telling
you
of
my
father
a
warrant
for
you
father
says
i
must
have
you
bodily
before
the
justice
and
my
lord
so
he
changed
colour
a
bit
at
first
but
he
saw
me
smile
i
done
no
sin
said
he
larry
you
may
lead
me
now
as
you
led
me
all
my
life
and
up
the
slope
he
went
with
me
as
light
as
fifteen
and
when
we
got
up
my
lord
clonbrony
said
am
sorry
an
old
tenant
and
a
good
old
tenant
as
i
hear
you
were
should
have
been
turned
out
of
your
farm
fret
it
no
great
matter
my
lord
said
my
father
shall
be
soon
out
of
the
way
but
if
you
would
be
so
kind
to
speak
a
word
for
my
boy
here
and
that
i
could
afford
while
the
life
is
in
me

my
other
boy

out
of
banishment

my
lord
clonbrony

word

i
proffer
but
i
know

clasped
my
two
hands
and
prayed
for
him
inwardly
and
my
father
was
dropping
down
on
his
knees
but
the
master
would
not
let
him
and
obsarved
that
posture
should
only
be
for
his
god
and
sure
enough
in
that
posture
when
he
was
out
of
sight
we
did
pray
for
him
that
night
and
will
all
our
days
but
before

quit
his
presence
