the
reader
will
perceive
from
the
body
of
this
work
that
the
history
of
prostitution
was
commenced
in
the
year
it
was
completed
and
ready
for
the
press
at
the
close
of
on
the
morning
of
february
the
island
hospital
on
blackwell
island
was
entirely
consumed
by
fire
which
spread
so
rapidly
as
to
render
it
impossible
to
save
any
thing
from
the
flames
among
the
property
destroyed
my

were

fortunately
the
first
draught
of
this

had
been
previously
removed
from

and
was
preserved
and
from
that
the
present

has
been

advantage
has
been
taken
of
the
opportunity
thus
afforded
carefully
to
revise
the

some
additional

bringing
the

of
new
york
especially
to
the
present
time
the
chapters
describing
foreign
prostitution
are
not
claimed
to
be
entirely
original
they
are
compilations
and
condensations
from
every
available
source
it
is
believed
that
the
authorities
have
been
named
in
most
cases
where
the
ideas
of
others
have
been
used
but
owing
to
the
loss
of
all
the
original
works
it
is
highly
probable
that
in
some
instances
this
has
been
overlooked
should

discover
any

of

arguments
are
unnecessary
to
prove
the
existence
of
prostitution
the
evil
is
so
notorious
that
none
can
possibly
gainsay
it
but
when
its
extent
its
causes
or
its
effects
are
questioned
a
remarkable
degree
of
ignorance
or
carelessness
is
manifested
few
care
to
know
the
secret
springs
from
which
prostitution
emanates
few
are
anxious
to
know
how
wide
the
stream
extends
few
have
any
desire
to
know
the
devastation
it
causes
society
has
formally
laid
a
prohibition
on
the
subject
and
he
who
presumes
to
argue
that
what
affects
one
may
injure
all
he
who
believes
that
the
malady
in
his
neighbor
family
may
visit
his
own
he
who
dares
to
intimate
that
a
vice
which
has
blighted
the
happiness
of
one
parent
and
ruined
the
character
of
one
daughter
may
produce
must
inevitably
produce
the
same
sad
results
in
another
circle
in
short
he
who
dares
allude
to
the
subject
of
prostitution
in
any
other
than
a
mysterious
and
whispered
manner
must
prepare
to
meet
the
frowns
and
censure
of
society
keen
was
the
knowledge
of
human
nature
acute
the
perception
of
worldly
sentiment
in
the
breast
of
an
accomplished
woman
lately
deceased
when
she
wrote
to
such
grievances
as
society
can
not
readily
cure
it
usually
forbids
utterance
on
pain
of
its
scorn
this
scorn
being
only
a
sort
of
tinseled
cloak
to
its
deformed
weakness
how
true
the
idea
many
a
man
who
has
attempted
to
unveil
a
hidden
crime
or
probe
a
secret
sorrow
but
too
well
knows
not
then
to
prove
that
prostitution
exists
for
that
is
so
glaringly
palpable
that
all
must
perforce
concede
it
but
to
ascertain
its
origin
progress
and
end
is
the
object
of
these
pages
the
finger
of
scorn
may
be
pointed
at
the
labor
the
world
may
wrap
itself
in
a
mantle
of
prudery
and
close
its
ears
against
sickening
details
the
complacent
public
may
demur
at
an
approach
to
sin
and
misery
the
community
may
object
to
view
wretchedness
drawn
from
the
obscurity
of
its
to
the
full
light
of
investigation
nevertheless
there
is
now
existing
a
moral
pestilence
which
creeps
insidiously
into
the
privacy
of
the
domestic
circle
and
draws
thence
the
myriads
of
its
victims
and
which
saps
the
foundation
of
that
holy
confidence
the
first
the
most
beautiful
attraction
of
home
there
is
an
physical
danger
so
fatally
destructive
that
the
world
would
recoil
as
from
the
spring
of
a
serpent
could
they
but
appreciate
its
malignity
a
malignity
which
is
daily
and
hourly
threatening
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
community
which
for
hundreds
of
years
has
been
slowly
but
steadily
making
its
way
onward
leaving
a
track
marked
with
broken
hopes
ruined
frames
and
sad
recollections
of
stricken
friends
and
which
now
in
the
full
force
of
an
impetus
acquired
and
aggravated
by
concealment
almost
defies
opposition
there
is
a
social
wrong
which
forces
upon
the
community
vast
expenditures
for
an
object
of
which
they
are
ignorant
which
swells
the
public
taxes
and
increases
individual
outlay
for
a
vice
which
has
hitherto
been
studiously
kept
in
concealment
these
reasons
were
sufficiently
powerful
to
induce
the
necessary
researches
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
work
and
they
are
considered
sufficient
to
justify
its
publication
an
unseen
evil
of
which
only
the
effects
are
visible
is
more
frightful
than
one
whose
dimensions
are
apparent
no
statesman
would
grapple
with
a
political
question
until
he
knew
its
form
and
pressure
no
philanthropist
can
satisfactorily
encounter
an
unknown
misery
both
may
judge
to
some
slight
extent
of
the
evil
they
can
not
see
but
the
one
can
not
venture
to
remove
it
nor
the
other
to
modify
its
woes
until
its
power
is
fully
known
this
has
so
far
been
the
case
with
prostitution
the
world
has
studiously
drawn
a
screen
before
it
and
when
the
sufferings
of
its
victims
became
so
apparent
that
the
vice
was
palpable
an
additional
mystery
was
thrown
around
it
and
the
people
of
the
nineteenth
century
know
it
but
as
a
sin
with
which
they
can
not
interfere
it
has
all
the
imagined
force
of
a
monster
because
of
its
obscurity
all
the
virulence
of
an
avenging
fiend
because
its
true
powers
are
hidden
and
even
those
who
suffered
from
its
poison
have
been
led
to
believe
that
its
mysteries
were
so
inscrutable
as
to
defy
all
approach
hitherto
reticence
has
been
the
policy
this
position
has
been
held
too
long
for
it
is
false
in
principle
and
injurious
in
tendency
the
day
has
arrived
when
the
shroud
must
be
removed
when
the
public
safety
imperiously
demands
an
investigation
into
the
matter
when
those
who
regard
it
as
a
small
wrong
may
have
their
attention
directed
to
its
real
proportions
and
when
those
who
have
viewed
it
as
an
unmanageable
giant
may
be
alike
undeceived
a
small
matter
it
decidedly
is
not
the
eternal
ruin
of
one
misguided
woman
would
effectually
preclude
such
an
opinion
the
physical
ruin
of
an
impetuous
man
would
prohibit
such
an
estimate
and
both
these
are
among
those
daily
consequences
which
call
for
an
investigation
there
is
scarcely
a
person
in
the
community
who
can
not
recall
some
circumstance
he
has
known
to
support
this
assertion
for
so
has
been
the
baneful
influence
of
prostitution
that
there
are
comparatively
few
but
have
suffered
through
friends
or
relatives
if
not
in
their
own
persons
nor
is
it
unmanageable
except
when
concealed
stripped
of
the
veil
of
secrecy
which
has
enveloped
it
there
appears
a
vice
arising
from
an
inextinguishable
natural
impulse
on
the
part
of
one
sex
fostered
by
confiding
weakness
in
the
other
from
social
disabilities
on
one
side
and
social
oppression
on
the
other
from
the
wiles
of
the
deceiver
working
upon
unsuspecting
credulity
and
finally
the
stern
necessity
to
it
is
a
mere
absurdity
to
assert
that
prostitution
can
ever
be
eradicated
strenuous
and
efforts
for
this
purpose
have
been
made
at
different
times
the
whole
power
of
the
church
where
it
possessed
not
merely
a
spiritual
but
an
actual
secular
arm
has
been
in
vain
directed
against
it
nature
defied
the
mandates
of
the
clergy
and
the
threatened
punishments
of
an
were
futile
to
deter
men
from
seeking
and
women
from
granting
sinful
pleasures
in
this
world
monarchs
victorious
in
the
field
and
unsurpassed
in
the
have
bent
all
their
energies
of
will
and
brought
all
the
aids
of
power
to
crush
it
out
but
before
these
vice
has
not
quailed
the
guilty
women
have
been
banished
scourged
branded
executed
their
partners
have
been
subjected
to
the
same
punishment
held
up
to
public
opinion
as
immoral
denuded
of
their
civil
rights
have
seen
their
offenses
visited
upon
their
families
have
been
led
to
the
stake
the
gibbet
and
the
block
and
still
prostitution
exists
the
teachings
of
morality
and
virtue
have
been
powerless
here
in
some
cases
they
restrain
individuals
upon
the
aggregate
they
are
inoperative
the
researches
of
science
have
been
unheeded
they
have
traced
the
physical
results
of
vice
and
have
foreshadowed
its
course
they
have
demonstrated
that
the
suffering
parents
of
this
generation
will
bequeath
to
their
posterity
a
heritage
of
ruined
powers
that
the
malady
which
illicit
pleasure
communicates
is
destructive
to
the
hopes
of
man
that
the
human
frame
is
perceptibly
and
regularly
depreciating
by
the
operation
of
this
poison
and
have
shown
that
even
the
desire
for
health
and
long
life
one
of
the
most
powerful
motives
that
ever
influences
a
human
being
has
been
of
no
avail
to
stem
the
torrent
but
if
history
proves
that
prostitution
can
not
be
suppressed
it
also
demonstrates
that
it
can
be
regulated
and
directed
into
channels
where
its
most
injurious
results
can
be
encountered
and
its
dangerous
tendencies
either
entirely
arrested
or
materially
weakened
this
is
the
policy
to
which
civilized
communities
are
tending
and
to
aid
the
movement
it
is
needful
that
the
subject
be
examined
even
at
the
risk
of
the
world
contumely
in
some
of
the
countries
of
continental
europe
the
examination
has
been
made
and
the
natural
consequences
of
a
searching
and
philosophical
investigation
are
there
seen
in
legislation
which
aims
not
to
dam
a
wild
torrent
but
to
lead
it
where
its
rage
may
be
harmlessly
spent
when
a
mighty
river
overflows
its
banks
the
uncontrollable
flood
works
ruin
and
devastation
along
its
course
but
the
same
river
confined
to
its
natural
channel
may
be
of
immense
service
in
carrying
off
a
vast
amount
of
filth
and
that
otherwise
would
cause
pestilence
and
death
in
this
western
hemisphere
and
in
the
prudery
has
stood
aloof
from
inquiring
into
a
vice
which
every
one
admits
to
be
offensive
to
the
moral
sense
of
the
people
and
has
submitted
to
an
accumulation
of
evils
rather
than
seek
to
abate
them
until
the
suffering
and
the
wrong
have
become
so
boldly
defined
that
they
force
themselves
upon
the
public
eye
assuredly
it
is
high
time
to
inaugurate
a
new
line
of
action
to
cast
aside
as
unworthy
those
puerile
doubts
of
propriety
and
expediency
which
have
stood
in
the
way
of
an
onward
progress
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
propriety
supplies
an
argument
in
favor
of
the
proposed
course
conventionally
it
has
been
construed
to
mean
an
indefinite
something
which
every
person
has
moulded
to
suit
his
own
predilections
upon
the
same
principle
that
a
man
who
makes
his
living
dishonestly
would
consider
it
a
glaring
impropriety
to
examine
the
laws
of
fraud
has
the
world
decided
it
an
outrage
against
propriety
to
inquire
into
a
vice
which
many
secretly
practice
but
all
publicly
condemn
reasoning
like
this
has
been
too
often
applied
and
with
too
great
an
effect
can
there
possibly
be
an
impropriety
in
investigating
a
vice
which
threatens
the
purity
and
peace
of
the
community
because
in
so
doing
unpleasant
facts
will
be
disclosed
is
there
not
a
far
more
striking
inconsistency
in
supinely
allowing
the
same
vice
to
exist
and
increase
without
hinderance
or
examination
again
it
must
be
conceded
that
the
demands
of
propriety
are
universal
they
are
not
restricted
to
any
person
or
place
but
press
with
equal
force
upon
every
member
of
the
community
in
every
possible
situation
the
common
welfare
is
involved
in
their
general
application
and
he
well
merits
the
good
opinion
of
his
who
points
them
to
a
case
where
propriety
is
outraged
and
asks
their
aid
to
apply
the
remedy
in
a
word
demands
an
exposure
of
all
acts
of
and
the
application
of
the
needful
cure
then
the
question
arises
in
what
form
shall
the
exposure
be
made
truth
admits
of
but
one
reply
it
must
be
so
explicit
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
its
meaning
it
must
be
so
guarded
as
not
to
offend
in
its
application
if
the
first
of
these
rules
is
not
observed
any
disclosure
will
be
worthless
if
the
remarks
are
vague
indefinite
or
generalized
no
good
result
can
accrue
take
a
simple
illustration
it
conveys
no
determinate
idea
to
a
benevolent
man
to
say
there
is
distress
in
a
certain
city
but
point
him
to
the
particular
locality
and
give
him
the
precise
circumstances
and
his
sympathy
is
at
once
aroused
and
effectively
exerted
the
same
rule
is
equally
applicable
to
a
monster
vice
and
to
an
individual
hardship
and
upon
this
principle
have
the
disclosures
of
the
following
pages
been
based
the
idea
has
been
to
particularize
sufficiently
to
draw
attention
but
not
enough
to
gratify
a
prurient
inclination
to
exhibit
the
evil
in
a
truthful
aspect
but
not
in
a
fascinating
form
none
can
doubt
the
truth
of
pope
lines
vice
is
a
monster
of
so
frightful
mien
as
to
be
hated
needs
but
to
be
seen
yet
seen
too
oft
familiar
with
her
face
we
first
endure
then
pity
then
embrace
the
endeavor
should
be
to
fulfill
the
imperative
demands
of
propriety
without
disturbing
the
conventional
prejudices
implied
by
the
same
word
then
as
to
expediency
or
the
fitness
to
effect
some
good
end
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
mere
fact
of
proving
prostitution
capable
of
control
is
a
good
object
and
it
is
apparent
that
such
proof
can
not
be
afforded
while
the
vice
remains
a
myth
something
must
be
known
of
its
haunts
and
its
customs
ere
any
one
can
decide
in
what
shape
a
supervisory
power
can
be
best
applied
this
knowledge
must
be
obtained
in
defiance
of
prejudices
commonplace
objections
about
the
danger
of
touching
impure
objects
are
best
met
by
the
remark
that
to
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
though
benevolence
may
at
times
lead
its
devotees
through
scenes
where
moral
purity
is
shocked
and
to
neighborhoods
where
filth
and
obscenity
vitiate
the
very
air
they
breathe
there
is
no
contamination
to
those
whose
motives
are
good
inexpediency
has
been
urged
as
often
and
as
falsely
as
impropriety
in
their
application
to
this
subject
both
are
perverted
from
their
legitimate
meaning
both
are
made
subservient
to
a
false
taste
or
a
mawkish
sensibility
which
fears
to
encounter
an
imaginary
danger
the
safety
of
the
community
so
far
as
its
sanitary
condition
is
concerned
imperatively
demands
an
inquiry
like
this
it
is
no
longer
necessary
to
prove
that
syphilitic
taint
is
propagated
by
the
direct
agency
of
prostitution
that
fact
has
been
demonstrated
years
ago
and
reasoning
from
it
we
rightly
infer
that
the
ravages
of
that
poison
can
be
checked
by
compelling
abandoned
women
to
certain
judicious
observances
one
thing
is
absolutely
certain
that
the
public
health
can
not
be
endangered
by
the
interference
and
there
is
a
moral
certainty
that
it
may
be
materially
benefited
the
value
of
this
investigation
so
far
as
relates
to
purely
physical
questions
consists
in
not
merely
pointing
out
where
the
evil
is
but
in
showing
to
what
extent
it
exists
and
then
contrasting
the
state
of
venereal
disease
its
rapid
increase
and
augmenting
virulence
in
this
country
with
its
condition
in
those
nations
where
similar
investigations
have
resulted
in
practical
measures
public
safety
imperatively
demands
this
investigation
as
a
means
of
tracing
the
habitual
resorts
of
criminals
it
is
not
necessary
to
inform
any
man
conversant
with
city
life
that
houses
of
ill
fame
are
the
common
resort
of
the
most
abandoned
of
the
male
part
of
the
community
there
the
assassin
against
whose
hand
no
life
is
secure
has
a
safe
retreat
the
burglar
who
commits
his
depredations
under
cover
of
the
shade
of
night
the
swindler
who
defrauds
the
honest
trader
by
false
representations
the
counterfeiter
who
earns
a
precarious
living
by
his
unholy
trade
these
hold
there
high
carnival
there
they
meet
to
recount
their
exploits
and
divide
the
spoils
to
devise
new
schemes
of
wickedness
or
lay
plans
by
which
simple
youths
may
be
allured
to
vilest
practices
there
is
another
phase
of
public
safety
which
demands
this
investigation
namely
the
preservation
of
female
honor
those
who
frequent
these
haunts
of
vice
are
forever
employed
in
casting
about
snares
to
entrap
the
young
the
unwary
or
the
friendless
woman
they
tempt
her
to
minister
to
their
libidinous
desires
and
swell
the
already
overcrowded
ranks
of
frailty
while
these
resorts
are
secret
there
is
every
facility
for
such
infamous
conduct
with
but
slight
probability
of
its
detection
and
still
slighter
opportunities
for
prevention
thither
too
young
men
and
even
boys
are
inveigled
by
those
who
have
grown
old
in
vice
and
there
are
they
taught
the
horrid
mysteries
of
unhallowed
passion
many
a
promising
youth
has
left
such
haunts
as
these
not
only
with
a
ruined
constitution
but
with
loss
of
character
and
honor
many
whose
names
swell
the
criminal
records
of
the
day
date
their
first
step
in
crime
from
the
hour
they
entered
a
common
brothel
again
public
safety
demands
this
investigation
because
of
the
superior
opportunities
it
will
afford
to
reformatory
measures
start
not
at
the
supposition
of
reforming
courtesans
there
is
hope
even
for
them
for
they
are
human
beings
though
depraved
their
hearts
throb
with
the
same
sympathies
that
move
the
more
favored
of
their
sex
their
minds
are
susceptible
to
the
same
emotions
as
those
of
other
females
few
of
them
become
vile
from
natural
instincts
poor
victims
of
circumstances
many
of
them
would
gladly
amend
if
the
proper
means
were
used
at
the
proper
time
there
is
in
every
human
heart
some
not
entirely
barren
part
where
flowers
of
richest
scent
may
blow
and
fruit
in
glorious
sunlight
grow
this
consummation
can
be
achieved
only
when
the
of
the
world
shall
yield
to
true
benevolence
and
charity
be
in
deed
what
it
professes
in
name
if
public
safety
is
thus
urgent
private
interest
also
has
arguments
in
favor
of
investigating
prostitution
no
one
need
be
told
that
public
aid
is
required
to
give
medical
treatment
to
the
unfortunate
men
and
women
tainted
by
this
vice
nor
need
any
one
be
assured
that
such
aid
administered
with
every
regard
to
economy
requires
yearly
a
large
portion
of
the
taxes
paid
by
individuals
it
would
be
sheer
folly
to
assert
that
any
measures
which
can
follow
this
inquiry
will
be
efficacious
in
eradicating
syphilis
but
experience
proves
that
an
effective
supervision
would
materially
abate
its
influence
render
it
curable
in
a
much
shorter
space
of
time
and
reduce
the
expenses
for
each
patient
in
a
corresponding
ratio
another
large
claim
upon
the
public
funds
arises
from
the
necessity
of
employing
an
extensive
judicial
and
police
organization
to
deal
with
the
crime
and
the
criminals
generated
and
fostered
in
houses
of
ill
fame
nests
of
vice
as
they
are
now
in
their
darkness
and
seclusion
it
would
be
impossible
to
suppose
a
more
fitting
nursery
for
crime
or
one
whence
more
criminals
would
emanate
as
with
disease
so
with
crime
it
can
not
be
suppressed
by
placing
its
retreats
under
public
notice
but
it
can
be
watched
and
once
brought
to
the
light
of
day
half
its
dangers
and
difficulties
become
surmountable
finally
private
interest
demands
this
investigation
on
mere
private
grounds
the
individual
and
personal
expenses
caused
by
diseases
contracted
by
debauchery
there
is
the
money
a
working
man
must
pay
for
his
cure
this
is
his
share
of
the
loss
there
is
the
unproductive
time
and
the
loss
of
profits
upon
his
labor
this
is
his
employer
sacrifice
there
is
the
deprivation
of
comforts
and
necessaries
experienced
by
his
family
and
dependents
this
is
their
penalty
society
is
thus
involved
in
a
general
loss
on
account
of
an
act
of
folly
or
passion
or
crime
call
it
which
you
please
committed
in
a
concealed
and
secret
haunt
and
such
loss
could
be
saved
by
the
intervention
of
proper
means
common
sense
asks
for
a
full
investigation
of
all
the
evils
attending
prostitution
in
the
affairs
of
life
any
man
who
feels
the
pressure
of
a
particular
evil
looks
at
once
for
its
cause
he
may
be
neither
a
philosopher
nor
a
logician
and
may
never
have
heard
of
or
read
any
of
the
luminous
treatises
which
professedly
simplify
science
yet
he
knows
very
well
that
for
every
effect
there
must
be
some
adequate
cause
and
for
this
he
generally
searches
diligently
till
he
can
find
and
remove
it
but
here
in
the
city
of
new
york
is
a
population
who
claim
to
be
as
intelligent
as
any
on
the
western
continent
who
have
been
for
years
suffering
from
the
effects
of
a
vice
in
purse
and
person
who
have
paid
and
are
paying
every
year
large
sums
of
money
on
account
of
it
who
witness
every
day
some
broken
constitution
or
ruined
character
resulting
from
it
and
who
yet
have
never
thought
of
seeking
out
the
cause
is
it
now
too
late
to
enlist
your
sympathies
in
the
undertaking
hence
we
conclude
that
propriety
expediency
public
safety
private
interest
and
common
sense
demand
an
investigation
like
this
now
submitted
to
the
reader
and
what
is
the
argument
brought
forward
to
oppose
it
the
world
scorn
this
scorn
being
only
a
sort
of
tinseled
cloak
to
its
deformed
weakness
but
is
not
this
scorn
powerless
against
the
array
of
favoring
motives
will
it
stand
the
test
of
comparison
with
any
one
of
them
much
less
of
all
is
not
its
influence
lost
when
its
real
character
is
known
the
reckless
carelessness
which
has
suffered
a
growing
vice
to
increase
and
multiply
which
has
permitted
a
deadly
to
take
root
and
blossom
in
the
community
until
its
poisonous
exhalations
threaten
universal
infection
which
has
by
its
actual
indifference
fostered
vice
promoted
seduction
perpetuated
disease
and
entailed
death
shall
this
deformed
weakness
now
raise
its
trembling
hands
and
exhibit
its
tottering
frame
and
lift
its
puny
voice
to
forbid
an
examination
into
the
sources
of
the
danger
has
not
the
finger
of
this
scorn
too
long
forbid
the
search
for
truth
has
not
the
hour
arrived
when
truth
will
speak
and
when
her
voice
must
be
heard
now
the
question
will
arise
has
the
world
indifference
produced
these
evils
undoubtedly
it
has
and
in
the
following
manner
laws
have
been
placed
upon
the
declaring
prostitutes
and
houses
of
prostitution
and
all
who
live
by
such
means
illegal
and
immoral
there
the
law
yet
stands
at
uncertain
intervals
some
poor
and
friendless
woman
is
arrested
as
a
vagrant
and
to
appease
the
offended
majesty
of
law
she
is
sent
to
prison
a
scapegoat
for
five
thousand
of
her
class
it
also
sometimes
happens
that
another
woman
equally
guilty
but
with
money
or
influence
is
arrested
at
the
same
time
and
for
the
same
offense
and
before
she
reaches
the
prison
walls
a
legal
quibble
has
been
raised
and
she
is
free
is
there
no
culpable
indifference
in
this
houses
of
prostitution
are
proscribed
by
law
how
many
of
them
are
ever
indicted
or
if
indicted
how
many
are
suppressed
this
too
is
owing
to
criminal
neglect
and
it
is
aggravated
by
the
injurious
effects
arising
from
the
mere
circumstance
of
allowing
a
law
to
exist
and
making
no
efforts
to
enforce
it
the
character
of
a
people
is
judged
not
by
the
laws
that
are
made
but
by
the
strictness
with
which
those
that
do
exist
are
enforced
and
observed
in
regard
to
the
first
there
may
be
exhibited
an
acute
perception
of
an
existing
evil
and
a
desire
to
reform
it
by
legislation
but
a
second
glance
may
reveal
no
wish
to
make
this
legislation
effective
in
the
special
matter
of
prostitution
the
opinion
is
expressed
elsewhere
that
prohibitory
laws
are
worse
than
useless
and
in
the
experience
of
new
york
city
there
is
nothing
to
shake
that
opinion
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
efforts
made
to
enforce
them
are
so
few
and
far
between
had
existing
laws
been
more
vigorously
enforced
their
inefficiency
would
long
since
have
been
much
better
understood
than
it
now
is
and
people
would
not
have
rested
under
the
delusion
that
every
thing
necessary
has
been
done
there
are
yet
other
cases
of
culpable
indifference
these
same
proscribed
houses
of
prostitution
are
suffered
to
exist
uncontrolled
and
to
spread
disease
and
increase
crime
and
vagrancy
in
all
parts
of
the
city
it
has
been
generally
conceded
that
they
can
not
be
suppressed
what
effort
has
been
made
to
hold
in
check
their
baneful
influence
none
literally
none
the
statesman
has
looked
on
appalled
at
an
evil
of
whose
magnitude
he
could
form
no
correct
idea
the
clergyman
has
hesitated
to
encounter
those
who
he
judged
would
not
respectfully
receive
his
admonitions
the
masses
of
society
have
shrunk
from
considering
a
subject
which
was
repugnant
and
distasteful
is
there
no
guilty
indifference
in
this
there
can
be
but
one
answer
to
this
query
but
one
opinion
as
to
the
share
this
general
apathy
has
had
in
fostering
the
evil
to
substitute
for
this
apathy
a
healthy
action
is
the
object
of
this
investigation
it
is
but
the
means
to
an
end
in
themselves
as
mere
matters
of
information
the
facts
and
deductions
presented
in
the
following
pages
can
do
nothing
but
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
exertion
but
of
this
necessity
they
do
afford
overwhelming
demonstration
thus
much
for
the
general
arguments
as
to
the
necessity
of
a
work
of
this
nature
there
are
other
special
and
local
causes
which
led
to
its
accomplishment
in
the
present
form
the
governors
of
the
of
the
city
and
county
of
new
york
or
as
they
are
more
generally
known
the
ten
governors
is
a
body
called
into
existence
by
an
act
of
the
state
legislature
passed
april
specially
to
take
charge
of
the
vagrant
and
pauper
institutions
of
the
city
the
present
members
of
the
board
are
the
following
citizens
godfrey
gunther
isaac
oliver
washington
smith

anthony
dugro
esq
cornelius
anderson

isaac
townsend

daniel
tiemann

benjamin

at
the
time
these
investigations
commenced
two
other
prominent
men
were
also
members
of
the
organization
hon
edward
west
now
surrogate
of
the
city
and
simeon
draper
esq
both
of
these
gentlemen
had
served
as
president
of
the
board
of
governors
with
honor
to
themselves
and
satisfaction
to
their
colleagues
and
the
public
both
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
projected
inquiry
and
to
both
am
i
indebted
for
much
valuable
assistance
the
act
establishing
the
board
of
governors
assigned
to
them
with
their
other
duties
medical
care
of
all
persons
who
had
contracted
infectious
diseases
in
the
practice
of
debauchery
and
who
required
charitable
aid
to
restore
them
to
the
result
was
that
a
very
large
number
of
persons
both
male
and
female
chargeable
to
the
citizens
of
new
york
through
the
medium
of
the
institutions
on
blackwell
island
came
under
their
cognizance
and
they
became
convinced
that
some
measures
were
necessary
in
connection
therewith
individual
members
had
held
this
opinion
for
some
time
before
any
official
action
was
taken
and
foremost
among
such
was
governor
isaac
townsend
this
gentleman
was
one
of
the
originally
appointed
governors
and
has
been
connected
with
the
board
by
ever
since
a
circumstance
which
made
him
perfectly
acquainted
with
all
the
workings
of
the
present
system
and
to
him
the
public
is
indebted
for
the
conception
of
this
undertaking
for
years
has
he
labored
to
bring
about
this
result
with
an
indomitable
energy
and
perseverance
equaled
only
by
his
known
benevolence
and
honesty
of
purpose
he
frequently
made
the
practicability
of
such
a
measure
the
subject
of
conversation
with
the
gentleman
who
preceded
me
as
resident
physician
of
blackwell
island
and
on
my
appointment
the
subject
was
again
urged
by
him
nor
could
i
be
unaware
of
its
importance
no
official
action
was
taken
until
the
commencement
of
the
year
at
that
time
townsend
was
president
of
the
board
and
one
of
his
first
acts
in
that
capacity
was
to
submit
a
list
of
interrogatories
on
the
subject
which
were
adopted
and
transmitted
to
me
i
transcribe
them
from
the
minutes
of
the
board
at
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
governors
of
the
held
january
the
following
interrogatories
were
presented
by
the
president
what
proportion
of
the
inmates
of
the
institutions
on
island
under
your
medical
charge
are
in
your
opinion
directly
or
indirectly
suffering
from
syphilis
are
or
are
not
the
number
of
such
inmates
steadily
on
the
increase
do
not
patients
in
the
different
institutions
particularly
in
the
penitentiary
hospital
often
leave
before
the
disease
is
cured
so
that
they
are
liable
to
infect
other
persons
after
their
departure
are
not
the
offspring
of
parents
affected
with
constitutional
syphilis
subject
to
many
diseases
of
like
character
which
cause
them
to
become
a
charge
upon
the
city
for
long
periods
of
time
and
often
for
life
what
are
your
views
in
reference
to
the
best
means
of
checking
and
decreasing
this
disease
and
what
plan
in
your
opinion
could
be
adopted
to
relieve
new
york
city
of
the
enormous
amount
of
misery
and
expense
caused
by
syphilis
you
will
reply
in
full
to
the
above
queries
at
the
earliest
possible
date
that
a
copy
of
the
above
be
sent
to
the
resident
physician
blackwell
island
to
reply
to
these
questions
especially
to
the
fifth
i
discovered
that
it
would
be
requisite
to
extend
my
investigations
beyond
the
limits
of
the
institutions
on
blackwell
island
this
idea
was
communicated
to
president
townsend
who
joined
me
in
appreciating
the
necessity
of
such
a
movement
he
also
was
the
means
of
interesting
mayor
wood
and
other
officers
of
the
city
in
the
investigation
as
subsequently
carried
on
while
his
continued
exertions
and
earnest
support
aided
me
generally
in
the
prosecution
of
the
labor
and
merit
my
most
sincere
and
grateful
acknowledgments
the
steps
thus
taken
are
fully
detailed
in
the
following
letter
to
the
board
of
governors
that
letter
or
preliminary
report
having
been
called
for
in
connection
with
the
reports
from
the
medical
board
of
bellevue
hospital
and
from
the
resident
physician
of
randall
island
which
will
be
found
in
chapter
xxxvii
of
this
work
isaac
townsend
of
the
board
of
dear
sir
in
reply
to
your
letter
asking
for
answers
to
certain
interrogatories
on
the
subject
of
prostitution
and
its
diseases
i
have
to
state
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
report
nor
can
i
do
so
for
some
considerable
length
of
time
to
come
had
i
confined
myself
to
simply
answering
the
queries
propounded
as
regards
the
institutions
under
my
medical
charge
simply
given
you
the
gross
numbers
with
the
percentages
of
those
who
have
suffered
or
are
now
suffering
from
venereal
disease
such
reply
could
have
been
sent
to
you
long
ago
a
report
of
this
kind
from
this
department
would
have
been
looked
upon
by
the
public
at
large
as
containing
the
history
of
nearly
all
the
prostitution
in
the
city
and
particularly
would
a
majority
of
the
public
have
believed
that
nineteen
twentieths
of
the
disease
resulting
from
prostitution
found
its
home
here
such
is
not
the
fact
great
as
is
the
number
of
prostitutes
annually
sent
here
and
enormous
as
is
the
number
of
cases
of
venereal
disease
yearly
treated
here
yet
these
compose
but
a
small
fraction
of
the
sum
total
actually
existing
in
this
city
there
are
but
few
more
prostitutes
on
the
island
than
are
to
be
found
on
the
same
number
of
acres
in
certain
portions
of
the
city
and
as
for
the
venereal
disease
why
gentlemen
the
island
has
the
advantage
it
is
the
least
dangerous
locality
believing
these
to
be
facts
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
think
that
any
practical
good
would
be
accomplished
by
giving
you
the
statistics
of
these
institutions
alone
it
would
have
been
merely
doing
what
has
been
done
before
and
would
have
yielded
no
additional
information
for
your
guidance
but
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
time
had
come
when
your
attention
might
be
solicited
to
the
various
facts
attending
the
aggregate
prostitution
of
the
city
for
despite
all
our
prohibitory
laws
it
is
a
fact
which
can
not
be
questioned
or
denied
that
this
vice
is
attaining
a
position
and
extent
in
this
community
which
can
not
be
viewed
without
alarm
it
has
more
than
kept
pace
with
the
growth
of
our
city
unlike
the
vice
of
a
few
years
since
it
no
longer
confines
itself
to
secrecy
and
darkness
but
boldly
strides
through
our
most
thronged
and
elegant
thoroughfares
and
there
in
the
broad
light
of
the
sun
it
jostles
the
pure
the
virtuous
and
the
good
it
is
in
your
gay
streets
and
in
your
quiet
streets
it
is
in
your
squares
and
in
your
suburban
retreats
and
summer
resorts
it
is
in
your
theatres
your
opera
your
hotels
nay
it
is
even
intruding
itself
into
the
private
circles
and
slowly
but
steadily
extending
its
poison
known
but
to
few
and
entirely
unsuspected
by
the
majority
of
our
citizens
the
whole
machinery
of
the
law
has
been
turned
against
these
females
without
success
its
only
result
having
been
a
resolve
on
their
part
to
confront
society
with
the
charge
of
harsh
cruel
and
unjust
treatment
from
these
considerations
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
obtain
all
the
facts
which
could
possibly
be
collected
having
any
relation
to
the
vice
in
question
assured
that
you
were
desirous
of
taking
a
comprehensive
view
of
it
and
hence
the
resolve
if
possible
to
trace
to
the
prostitution
and
its
attendant
diseases
so
as
to
be
enabled
to
bring
the
subject
before
you
in
a
form
which
should
exhibit
it
in
its
proper
colors
and
dimensions
the
first
step
in
this
investigation
was
to
obtain
ample
and
reliable
information
of
the
extent
of
the
vice
as
it
exists
outside
of
these
departments
a
step
which
would
have
been
beyond
my
power
alone
from
the
bold
and
reformatory
stand
which
his
honor
mayor
wood
had
taken
in
regard
to
many
matters
connected
with
our
city
government
it
was
believed
that
he
would
render
his
assistance
if
convinced
of
the
propriety
and
prospective
usefulness
of
the
investigation
and
the
result
of
an
application
by
president
isaac
townsend
to
his
honor
fully
justified
the
correctness
of
this
supposition
he
was
found
not
only
willing
to
aid
in
this
great
work
but
fully
alive
to
its
necessity
and
importance
the
plan
adopted
to
forward
the
inquiry
was
to
take
a
census
of
the
city
so
far
as
regards
prostitution
including
the
number
of
houses
of
prostitution
the
number
of
prostitutes
the
causes
which
led
them
to
become
such
their
ages
habits
early
history
education
religious
instruction
occupation
and
which
census
is
now
being
taken
by
the
chief
of
police
george
matsell
and
the
captains
of
police
simultaneously
with
this
inquiries
are
also
being
prosecuted
concerning
the
extent
of
venereal
disease
in
new
york
which
will
afford
interesting
information
this
of
course
will
be
done
without
individual
exposure
nor
will
the
report
when
completed
assume
the
form
of
a
by
which
persons
can
find
houses
of
ill
fame
i
am
desirous
of
obtaining
the
aggregate
facts
of
the
vice
and
shall
be
cautious
to
take
no
steps
toward
gratifying
a
prurient
curiosity
or
lacerating
a
rankling
wound
when
these
facts
are
before
you
they
will
be
their
own
argument
for
the
necessity
of
action
i
do
not
trouble
you
on
this
occasion
with
any
remarks
upon
the
deadly
nature
of
the
venereal
poison
but
when
you
are
informed
as
to
the
facilities
for
its
diffusion
will
be
the
proper
time
to
do
so
neither
would
it
be
consistent
with
this
stage
of
the
inquiry
to
enter
into
any
discussion
as
to
the
plans
that
could
be
adopted
in
mitigation
of
the
vice
for
although
prohibitory
measures
have
failed
to
suppress
or
even
check
it
yet
until
its
full
extent
is
known
i
do
not
imagine
that
you
would
deem
it
prudent
to
attempt
to
grapple
a
monster
whose
strength
was
not
fully
ascertained
you
perceive
that
to
obtain
all
the
information
necessary
on
this
matter
will
be
a
work
requiring
both
time
and
labor
and
i
respectfully
ask
your
forbearance
with
the
assurance
that
i
will
lay
the
result
of
my
inquiries
before
you
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
and
with
the
hope
that
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
the
subject
will
be
an
apology
for
the
time
to
which
it
is
necessarily

i

very
respectfully
william
sanger
physician
blackwell
to
aid
the
police
officers
in
the
duty
of
taking
the
census
alluded
to
above
a
schedule
of
questions
was
prepared
this
was
submitted
to
the
board
of
governors
by
governor
townsend
and
a
resolution
was
adopted
at
their
meeting
of
october
sanctioning
the
plan
adopted
and
authorizing
him
to
have
a
sufficient
number
of
copies
printed
the
mayor
the
district
attorney
the
chief
of
police
and
the
captains
of
the
several
districts
willingly
and
zealously
with
governor
townsend
and
myself
and
every
possible
exertion
was
used
to
obtain
accurate
and
extensive
information
it
became
my
duty
to
assist
the
officers
in
the
execution
of
their
task
and
i
am
thus
enabled
to
speak
with
certainty
as
to
the
authenticity
of
the
statistics
given
which
were
mainly
collected
my
own
i
gladly
avail
myself
of
the
present
opportunity
to
record
my
obligations
for
services
rendered
by
his
honor
fernando

of
the

is

and
upon
whom
fell
the

of

i
am
more
particularly
indebted
the
necessary
particulars
were
finally
obtained
and
are
embodied
in
chapters
xxxii
to
xxxvii
of
this
work
but
there
was
still
an
important
point
to
determine
namely
what
had
been
done
elsewhere
and
what
was
the
result
of
such
action
to
check
prostitution
and
diminish
the
ravages
of
venereal
disease
the
continent
of
europe
presented
a
field
for
this
inquiry
and
to
it
i
turned
for
the
information
required
which
is
given
in
the
various
chapters
devoted
to
the
several
countries
in
such
a
form
as
to
show
the
measures
which
have
been
taken
the
effect
and
the
causes
which
led
to
legislative
interference
contrasted
with
those
other
parts
of
the
world
where
as
yet
no
remedial
plans
have
been
tried
notwithstanding
the
necessity
which
calls
for
them
the
reader
is
now
in
possession
of
the
facts
which
led
to
this
inquiry
is
it
too
much
to
ask
his
attention
to
the
analysis
and
exhibition
of
prostitution
as
it
is
at
the
present
time
he
being
well
assured
that
no
assertions
will
be
made
that
are
not
supported
by
good
authority
nor
any
conclusions
drawn
from
doubtful
premises
so
far
as
new
york
alone
is
concerned
the
evil
is
known
to
a
large
portion
of
her
citizens
although
its
ramifications
are
but
very
imperfectly
understood
and
the
endeavor
will
be
to
present
all
possible
information
on
the
matter
and
to
give
a
truthful
unexaggerated
picture
of
the
depravity
disagreeable
as
this
must
be
from
the
nature
of
the
task
it
is
hopeful
from
a
belief
that
the
result
will
tend
to
public
good
one
of
the
most
painfully
interesting
branches
of
the
inquiry
is
that
relating
to
the
ages
of
the
unfortunate
women
their
number
includes
many
who
are
but
mere
children
who
but
recently
knelt
at
a
mother
side
and
in
infantile
accents
breathed
a
prayer
to
the
almighty
who
but
recently
sprang
with
eager
joyous
bound
to
the
returning
footsteps
of
a
father
who
in
a
happy
and
innocent
home
have
but
recently
given
promise
of
a
bright
and
virtuous
life
therein
are
also
included
many
who
were
deprived
by
death
of
their
natural
protectors
and
who
thus
left
unwatched
and
uncared
for
have
fallen
before
the
destroyer
ere
yet
the
age
of
womanhood
was
reached
the
places
of
their
birth
form
an
interesting
subject
for
consideration
in
this
land
the
frigid
north
and
sunny
south
the
busy
east
and
fertile
west
have
each
contributed
their
quota
while
foreign
countries
have
sent
large
numbers
to
swell
the
mournful
aggregate
the
most
useful
portion
of
the
subject
will
be
found
it
is
imagined
in
replies
to
the
question
what
was
the
cause
of
your
becoming
a
prostitute
these
tend
to
expose
the
concealed
vices
of
mankind
and
to
prove
that
many
of
the
unfortunate
victims
are
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
among
the
reasons
assigned
for
a
deviation
from
the
paths
of
virtue
are
some
which
tell
of
man
deceit
others
where
the
machinations
employed
to
effect
the
purpose
raise
a
blush
for
humanity
others
where
a
wife
was
sacrificed
by
the
man
who
had
sworn
before
god
and
in
the
presence
of
men
to
protect
her
through
life
others
where
parents
have
urged
or
commanded
this
course
and
are
now
living
on
the
proceeds
of
their
children
shame
or
where
an
abuse
of
parental
authority
has
produced
the
same
effect
and
others
still
where
women
already
depraved
have
been
the
means
of
leading
their
to
disgrace
a
bare
allusion
to
these
wrongs
is
sickening
but
while
the
gangrene
of
prostitution
is
rapidly
extending
through
society
it
becomes
an
imperative
duty
to
examine
its
causes
completely
and
impartially
another
prolific
source
of
female
depravity
will
be
exhibited
by
the
several
tables
showing
the
description
of
employment
pursued
and
the
wages
received
by
women
previous
to
their
fall
and
it
will
be
a
question
for
the
political
economist
to
decide
how
far
mere
business
considerations
should
be
an
apology
on
the
part
of
employers
for
a
reduction
in
their
rates
of
remuneration
and
whether
the
saving
of
a
small
percentage
on
wages
is
not
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
enormous
amount
of
taxation
enforced
on
the
public
at
large
to
defray
the
expenses
incurred
on
account
of
a
system
of
vice
which
is
the
direct
result
in
many
cases
of
insufficient
compensation
for
honest
labor
in
conclusion
it
must
not
be
assumed
that
the
information
collected
from
two
thousand
women
in
new
york
city
relates
to
the
prostitutes
therein
the
many
difficulties
surrounding
the
investigation
and
especially
the
secrecy
to
which
prohibitory
laws
have
driven
this
class
of
persons
rendered
the
task
impossible
but
from
the
best
information
that
could
be
obtained
of
those
whose
knowledge
of
the
vice
was
derived
from
actual
experience
it
is
imagined
that
the
replies
represent
about
two
fifths
of
the
total
number
they
are
presented
with
full
confidence
in
their
general
authenticity
and
may
be
very
reasonably
concluded
to
offer
a
fair
average
of
the
whole
they
unquestionably
exhibit
an
appalling
amount
of
depravity
and
consequent
wretchedness
with
but
very
few
redeeming
features
and
present
mournful
subjects
for
reflection
to
all
classes
with
forcible
arguments
for
remedial
measures
without
this
end
in
prospect
it
would
have
been
scarcely
justifiable
at
least
in
a
moral
point
of
view
to
institute
this
inquiry
or
make
these
disclosures
but
it
certainly
may
be
reasonably
inferred
that
many
will
feel
sufficient
interest
in
the
advance
of
virtue
to
aid
in
the
mitigation
of
this
enormous
vice
which
threatens
all
social
relations
which
has
already
introduced
physical
suffering
into
so
many
families
and
the
influence
of
which
increasing
in
a
direct
ratio
to
its
existence
will
very
probably
extend
its
malignant
poison
mental
and
bodily
into
all
ranks
and
classes
of
the
community
the
necessity
for
action
is
apparent
but
its
successful
consummation
must
rest
with
the
public
at
large
who
have
the
bane
exhibited
before
them
in
its
actual
power
and
the
necessity
of
an
antidote
demonstrated
from
positive
facts
and
not
deduced
from
a
mere
arbitrary
theory
if
some
antidote
be
applied
even
though
a
partial
one
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
reflect
that
the
investigations
have
not
been
profitless
nor
the
labor
in
vain
history
of
prostitution
if
the
reader
has
not
already
perused
the
introduction
to
this
volume
he
is
advised
to
do
so
at
once
as
therein
are
stated
the
reasons
which
have
called
it
forth
and
extended
it
to
the
present
dimensions
chapter

the
eighteenth
century
tamar
and

of
syrian

of

condition
of
jewish
description
by
the
jews
of
babylon
our
earliest
acquaintance
with
the
human
race
discloses
some
sort
of
society
established
it
also
reveals
the
existence
of
a
marriage
tie
varying
in
stringency
and
incidental
effects
according
to
climate
morals
religion
or
accident
but
every
where
essentially
subversive
of
a
system
of
promiscuous
intercourse
no
nation
it
is
believed
has
ever
been
reported
by
a
trustworthy
traveler
on
sufficient
evidence
to
have
held
its
women
generally
in
common
still
there
appear
to
have
been
in
every
age
men
who
did
not
avail
themselves
of
the
marriage
covenant
or
who
could
not
be
bound
by
its
stipulations
and
their
appetites
created
a
demand
for
illegitimate
pleasures
which
female
weakness
supplied
this
may
be
assumed
to
be
the
real
origin
of
prostitution
throughout
the
world
though
in
particular
localities
this
first
cause
has
been
assisted
by
female
avarice
or
passion
religious
superstition
or
a
mistaken
sense
of
hospitality
accordingly
prostitution
is
coeval
with
society
it
stains
the
earliest
mythological
records
it
is
constantly
assumed
as
an
existing
fact
in
biblical
history
we
can
trace
it
from
the
earliest
twilight
in
which
history
dawns
to
the
clear
daylight
of
without
a
pause
or
a
moment
of
obscurity
our
most
ancient
historical
record
is
believed
to
be
the
books
of
moses
according
to
them
it
must
be
admitted
that
prostitutes
were
common
among
the
jews
in
the
eighteenth
century
before
christ
when
tamar
the
of
judah
desired
to
defeat
the
cruel
jewish
custom
and
to
bear
children
notwithstanding
her
widowhood
she
put
her
garments
off
from
her
and
covered
her
with
a
veil
and
wrapped
herself
and
sat
in
an
open
place
when
judah
saw
her
he
thought
her
a
harlot
for
she
had
covered
her
face
the
genesiacal
account
thus
shows
that
prostitutes
with
covered
faces
must
have
been
common
at
the
time
it
is
the
more
valuable
as
it
furnishes
the
particulars
of
the
transaction
to
keep
up
her
disguise
tamar
demands
a
kid
as
her
recompense
judah
agrees
and
leaves
his
signet
and
his
bracelets
and
his
staff
as
a
pledge
for
the
kid
it
appears
to
have
been
regarded
as
no
dishonor
to
have
commerce
with
a
prostitute
for
judah
sends
his
friend
the
adullamite
a
man
of
standing
to
deliver
the
kid
but
to
defraud
the
unfortunate
woman
of
her
gain
must
have
been
considered
shameful
for
when
judah
learns
that
she
has
disappeared
he
expresses
alarm
lest
we
be
shamed
for
not
having
paid
the
stipulated
price
it
may
also
be
noticed
as
an
illustration
of
the
connection
between
prostitution
and
pure
domestic
morals
that
when
judah
learns
that
his
is
pregnant
he
instantly
orders
her
to
be
burned
for
having
played
the
harlot
four
centuries
afterward
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
moses
to
legislate
on
the
jewish
morals
no
doubt
sadly
corrupted
by
their
sojourn
in
egypt
his
command
is
formal
and
emphatic
do
not
prostitute
thy
daughter
lest
the
land
fall
to
whoredom
there
shall
be
no
whore
of
the
daughters
of
israel
he
was
equally
decided
in
his
condemnation
of
worse
practices
to
which
it
would
appear
the
jews
were
much
addicted
he
laid
penalties
on
uncleanness
of
every
kind
and
on
fornication
but
it
would
appear
that
he
rather
confirmed
than
abrogated
the
customary
right
of
a
jewish
father
to
sell
his
daughter
as
a
concubine
with
the
practical
view
of
improving
the
physical
condition
of
the
race
moses
guarded
by
elaborate
laws
against
improper
and
corrupt
unions
adultery
and
rape
he
punished
with
death
the
bride
was
bound
under
pain
of
death
by
stoning
to
prove
to
the
satisfaction
not
only
of
her
husband
but
of
the
tribe
that
she
had
been
chaste
to
the
day
of
her
marriage
a
long
list
of
relatives
were
specified
among
whom
it
was
illegal
to
intermarry
furthermore
moses
endeavored
with
marked
zeal
to
check
the
progress
of
disease
among
both
sexes
whether
the
maladies
mentioned
in
leviticus
were
syphilitic
in
their
nature
it
were
difficult
to
say
modern
medical
science
admits
that
in
hot
climates
want
of
cleanliness
and
frequent
amorous
indulgence
will
generate
phenomena
similar
to
the
issue
so
frequently
mentioned
by
moses
however
this
be
it
is
certain
that
both
jews
and
jewesses
were
subject
to
diseases
apparently
similar
to
the
common
gonorrhoea
that
these
diseases
were
infectious
and
that
moses
in
reiterated
injunctions
forbade
all
sexual
intercourse
and
almost
all
association
with
persons
thus
afflicted
so
earnest
was
his
desire
to
eradicate
the
evil
from
the
people
that
he
extended
his
prohibition
to
women
during
the
period
of
their
menstrual
visitation
having
done
this
much
for
the
jews
moses
appears
to
have
connived
at
the
intercourse
of
their
young
men
with
foreign
prostitutes
he
took
an
ethiopian
concubine
himself
syrian
women
moabites
midianites
and
other
neighbors
of
the
jews
many
of
them
as
it
appears
young
and
lovely
but
with
debauched
and
vicious
principles
established
themselves
as
prostitutes
in
the
land
of
israel
for
many
years
until
the
time
of
solomon
they
were
excluded
from
jerusalem
and
the
large
cities
driven
to
the
highways
for
refuge
they
lived
in
booths
and
tents
where
they
combined
the
trade
of
a
peddler
with
the
calling
of
a
harlot
unlike
tamar
they
did
not
veil
the
face
reclining
within
the
tent
with
no
more
clothing
than
the
heat
of
the
climate
suggested
these
dissolute
girls
invited
the
complaisance
of
passengers
who
stopped
to
refresh
their
thirst
or
replenish
their
wardrobe
at
their
booth
so
long
as
their
practices
violated
no
law
of
nature
the
prudent
legislator
pursued
a
tolerant
policy
before
long
however
abominable
rites
in
honor
of
moloch
baal
or
belphegor
were
formally
established
by
the
strange
women
and
their
male
accomplices
moloch
whose
disgusting
exactions
we
find
in
phoenicia
and
at
carthage
also
demanded
male
worship
the
belly
of
the
god
statue
was
a
furnace
in
which
a
fierce
fire
was
kindled
and
fed
with
animal
sacrifice
around
it
the
priests
and
their
proselytes
danced
to
the
sound
of
music
sang
wild
songs
and
debased
themselves
by
practices
of
a
disgusting
and
unnatural
character
nor
was
the
worship
of
baal
less
revolting
he
too
had
his
statues
in
forms
eminently
calculated
to
excite
the
animal
passions
and
surrounded
by
cool
groves
in
which
the
most
shameless
prostitution
was
carried
on
by
all
who
would
deposit
an
offering
on
the
altars
of
the
idol
it
would
even
seem
from
several
passages
in
the
bible
that
the
participators
in
these
infamies
were
not
invariably
human
beings
against
such
enormities
the
wrath
of
moses
and
his
successors
was
aroused
on
hygienic
as
well
as
moral
and
religious
grounds
participation
in
the
rites
of
moloch
was
punished
with
death
aaron
grandson
did
not
hesitate
to
commit
a
double
homicide
to
mark
the
divine
abhorrence
of
the
daughters
of
midian
and
moses
himself
warned
by
the
frightful
progress
of
disease
among
the
male
jews
struck
at
its
roots
by
exterminating
every
female
midianite
among
his
captives
save
the
virgins
only
an
express
command
forbade
the
establishment
of
groves
near
the
jewish
temples
evidently
on
account
of
the
convenience
such
shady
retreats
afforded
to
prostitutes
yet
on
various
occasions
in
the
history
of
israel
we
find
accounts
of
the
destruction
of
such
groves
and
of
the
statues
of
the
gods
in
whose
honor
human
nature
was
defiled
solomon
whose
wisdom
was
singularly
alloyed
with
sensuality
not
only
set
the
example
of
inordinate
lust
keeping
it
is
said
seven
hundred
wives
and
three
hundred
concubines
but
repealed
the
wise
restrictions
of
his
predecessors
in
regard
to
prostitutes
allowing
them
to
exercise
their
calling
within
the
city
of
jerusalem
they
multiplied
so
fast
that
the
prophets
speak
of
them
wandering
on
all
the
hills
and
prostituting
themselves
under
every
tree
and
at
a
later
date

i
discerned
among

behold
there
met

of

she

loud

not

she
is
without
now
in

and
lieth
in

at

so
she
caught
him
and
kissed
him
and
with
an
impudent
face
said
unto
him
i

therefore

generally

until
the

the

not
permit
us
to

it

be
questioned
whether
it

among

a

made

by

at

nor

when

they

close

a

then

manner
in

and
to
the
sound
of

and
other
musical
instruments
there
is
little
reason
to
doubt
that
the
temples
like
those
of
baal
were
houses
of
prostitution
on
an
extensive
scale
herodotus
remarks
significantly
that
a
law
in
egypt
forbade
sexual
intercourse
within
the
walls
of
a
temple
and
exacted
of
both
sexes
that
intercourse
should
be
followed
by
ablution
before
the
temple
was
entered
where
piety
required
such
sacrifices
it
is
not
surprising
that
public
morals
were
loose
it
was
not
considered
wholly
shameful
for
an
egyptian
to
make
his
living

the
hire
of
his
daughter
person
and
a
king
is
mentioned
who
resorted
to
this
plan
in

to
discover

such
was
the
astonishing
appetite
of
the
men
that
young
and
beautiful
women
were
never
delivered
to
the

until
they
had
been
dead

the

its

and

to
the
beauty
of
its
courtesans

a
large
portion
of

is
doubtless
mythical

remains
to

the
opinion
that
she
was
though
a
prostitute
a
wealthy
and
highly
considered
person
in
chaldæa
too

babylonian
female
was
obliged
by
law
to
prostitute
herself
once
in
her
life
in
the
temple
of
the
chaldæan
venus
whose
name
was
mylitta
herodotus
appears
to
have
seen
the
park
and
grounds
in
which
this
singular
sacrifice
was
made
they
were
constantly
filled
with
women
with
strings
bound
round
their
hair
once
inside
the
place
no
woman
could
leave
it
until
she
had
paid
her
debt
and
had
deposited
on
the
altar
of
the
goddess
the
fee
received
from
her
lover
some
who
were
plain
remained
there
as
long
as
three
years
but
as
the
grounds
were
always
filled
with
a
troop
of
voluptuaries
in
search
of
pleasure
the
young
the
beautiful
the
seldom
needed
to
remain
over
a
few
minutes
this
strange
custom
is
mentioned
by
the
prophet
baruch
who
introduces
one
of
the
women
reproaching
her
neighbor
that
she
had
not
been
deemed
worthy
of
having
her
girdle
of
cord
burst
asunder
by
any
man
similar
statements
are
made
by
strabo
and
other
ancient
writers
at
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
the
demoralization
had
reached
a
climax
babylonian
banquets
were
scenes
of
infamies
when
the
meal
began
the
women
sat
modestly
enough
in
presence
of
their
fathers
and
husbands
but
as
the
wine
went
round
they
lost
all
restraint
threw
off
one
garment
after
another
and
enacted
scenes
of
glaring
immodesty
and
these
were
the
ladies
of
the
best
families
the
mylitta
of
chaldæa
became
astarte
in
phoenicia
at
carthage
and
in
syria
nothing
was
changed
but
the
name
the
voluptuous
rites
were
identical
in
addition
to
the
forced
prostitution
in
the
temples
however
the
phoenicians
and
most
of
their
colonies
maintained
for
many
years
the
practice
of
requiring
their
maidens
to
bestow
their
favors
on
any
strangers
who
visited
the
country
commercial
interest
no
doubt
had
some
share
in
promoting
so
scandalous
a
custom
on
the
high
shores
of
phoenicia
as
at
carthage
and
in
the
island
of
cyprus
the
traveler
sailing
past
in
his
boat
could
see
beautiful
girls
arrayed
in
light
garments
stretching
inviting
arms
to
him
originally
the
sum
paid
by
the
lover
was
offered
to
the
goddess
but
latterly
the
girls
kept
it
and
it
served
to
enhance
their
value
in
the
matrimonial
market
in
some
places
the
girl
was
free
if
she
chose
to
abandon
her
hair
to
the
goddess
but
lucian
notes
that
this
was
an
uncommonly
rare
occurrence
very
similar
were
the
customs
of
the
lydians
and
their
successors
in
empire
the
early
persians
their
venus
was
named
mithra
in
honor
of
whom
festivals
were
given
at
which
human
nature
was
horribly
outraged
fathers
and
daughters
sons
and
mothers
husbands
and
wives
sat
together
at
the
table
while
voluptuous
dances
and
music
inflamed
their
senses
and
when
the
wine
had
done
its
work
a
promiscuous
combat
of
sensuality
began
which
lasted
all
night
details
of
such
scenes

was
a

however

formally
established

of

at

and
filled
them
with
female
slaves
they
were
called
and
the
female
tenants
bought
with
the
public
money
and
bound
by
law
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
all
who
visited
them
they
were
in

public
servants
and
their
wretched
gains
were
a
legitimate
source
of
revenue
to
the
state
prostitution
became
a
state
monopoly
and
so
profitable
that
even
in
solon
lifetime
a
superb
temple
dedicated
to
venus
the
courtesan
was
built
out
of
the
fund
accruing
from
this
source
the
fee
charged
however
appears
to
have
been
small
in
solon
time
the
dicteriades
were
kept
widely
apart
from

of
repute
they
were
not
allowed
to
mix
in
religious
ceremonies
or
to
enter
the
temples
when
they
appeared
in
the
streets
they
were
obliged
to
wear
a
particular
costume
as
a
badge
of
infamy
they
forfeited
what
rights
of

they
may
have
possessed
in
virtue
of
their
birth
a
procurer
or
procuress
who
had
been
instrumental
in
introducing
a
athenian
girl
to
the
dicterion
incurred
the
penalty
of
death
nor
was
the
law
content
with
branding
with
infamy
prostitutes
and
their
accomplices
alone
their
children
were
bastards
that
is
to
say
they
could

duty

age
these
regulations
for
which
solon
obtained
the
praise
of
athenian
philosophers
were
not
long
maintained
in
force
tradition
imputed
to
the
profligacy
of
the
pisistratidæ
a
relaxation
of
the
laws
concerning
prostitutes
it
was
believed
that
the
sons
of
pisistratus
not
only
gave
to
the
dicteriades
the
freedom
of
the
city
but
allotted
to
them
seats
at
banquets
beside
the
most
respectable
matrons
and
on
certain
days
each
year
turned
them
into
their
father
beautiful
gardens
and
let
loose
upon
them
the
whole
petulance
of
the
athenian
youth
the
law
against
procuresses
was
modified
a
fine
being
substituted
for
death
about
the
same
time
says
the
scandalous
greek
chronicle
the
for
adultery
was
also
commuted
for
scourging
still
notwithstanding
this
falling
off
it
would
appear
that
athens
was
more
moral
than
her
neighbors
corinth
and
sparta
the
former
then
the
most
flourishing
of
greece
was
filled
with
a
very
low
class
of
prostitutes
no
laws
regulated
the
subject
any
female
who
chose
could
open
house
for
the
accommodation
of
travelers
and
seamen
and
though
corinth
was
yet
far
from
the
proverbial
celebrity
it
afterward
obtained
for
its
prostitutes
there
is
no
doubt
they
bore
a
fearful
proportion
to
the
aggregate
population
of
the
port
at
sparta
the
case
was
different
in
the
system
of
legislation
which
bears
the
name
of
lycurgus
the
individual
was
sacrificed
to
the
state
the
female
to
the
male
women
were
educated
for
the
sole
purpose
of
bearing
robust
children
virgins
were
allowed
to
wrestle
publicly
with
men
girls
were
habited
in
a
robe
open
at
the
skirts
which
only
partially
concealed
the
person
in
walking
whence
the
spartan
women
acquired
an
uncomplimentary
name
a
spartan
husband
was
authorized
to
lend
his
wife
to
any
handsome
man
for
the
purpose
of
begetting
children
that
these
laws
the
skillfully
contrived
appeals
to
the
sensual
appetites
and
the
constant
spectacle
of
nude
charms
must
have
led
to
a
general
profligacy
among
the
female
sex
is
quite
obvious
aristotle
affirms
positively
that
the
spartan
women
openly
committed
the
grossest
acts
of
debauchery
hence
it
may
be
inferred
that
prostitutes
by
profession
were
unnecessary
at
sparta
at
all
events
until
a
late
period
of
its
history
after
the
persian
wars
the
subject
of
athenian
prostitution
is
revealed
in
a
clearer
light
as
a
reaction
from
the
looseness
of
the
age
of
the
pisistratidæ
the
solonian
laws
were
reaffirmed
and
their
severity
heightened
it
has
been
imagined
from
certain
obscure
passages
in
greek
authors
that
the
courtesans
formed
several
corporations
each
of
which
was
responsible
for
the
acts
of
all
its
members
they
were
liable
to
vexatious
prosecutions
for
such
acts
as
inciting
men
to
commit
crime
ruining
thoughtless
youths
fomenting
treason
against
the
state
or
committing
impiety
against
such
charges
it
was
rarely
possible
to
establish
a
sound
defense
if
the
accuser
was
positive
the
areopagus
notoriously
biased
against
courtesans
unhesitatingly
condemned
the
culprit
to
death
or
imposed
on
her
corporation
a
heavy
fine
in
this
way
says
an
old
author
the
state
frequently
contrived
to
get
back
from
these
women
the
money
they
obtained
from
their
lovers
before
the
famous
case
of
phryne
they
were
wholly
at
the
mercy
of
their
profligate
associates
a
man
only
needed
to
threaten
an
accusation
of
impiety
or
the
like
to
obtain
a
receipt
in
full
phryne
so
long
the
favorite
of
the
athenians
was
thus
accused
of
various
vague
offenses
by
a
common
informer
named
euthias
her
friend
bacchis
fortunately
persuaded
hyperides
the
orator
to
undertake
her
case
and
he
softened
the
judges
by
exhibiting
her
marvelous
beauty
in
a
moment
of
affected
passion
henceforth
says
the
hetaira
bacchis
to
myrrhina
our
profits
are
secured
by
law
at
this
time
that
is
to
say
at
the
height
of
athenian
prosperity
there
were
four
classes
of
women
who
led
dissolute
lives
at
athens
the
highest
in
rank
and
repute
were
the
or
kept
women
who
lived
in
the
best
part
of
the
city
and
exercised
no
small
influence
over
the
manners
and
even
the
politics
of
the
state
next
came
the
or
who
were
dancers
as
well
they
were
usually
foreigners
bearing
some
resemblance
to
the
of
the
last
century
and
they
combined
the
most
unblushing
debauchery
with
their
special
calling
the
lowest
class
of
prostitutes
were
the
already
mentioned
they
were
originally
bound
to
reside
at
the
piræus
the
of
athens
some
four
miles
from
the
city
and
were
forbidden
to
walk
out
by
day
or
to
offend
the
eyes
of
the
public
by
open
indecency
lastly
came
the
who
were
slaves
owned
by
rich
men
with
the
knowledge
and
consent
of
their
wives
serving
equally
the
passions
of
their
master
and
the
caprices
of
their
mistress
these
all
paid
a
tax
to
the
state
called
which
was
farmed
out
to
speculators
who
levied
it
with
proverbial
harshness
upon
the
unfortunate
women
in
the
time
of
pericles
the
revenue
from
this
source
was
large
all
classes
too
wore
garments
of
many
colors
the
law
originally
specified
flowered
robes
as
the
costume
of
courtesans
but
this
leading
to
difficulties
a
farther
enactment
prohibited
prostitutes
from
wearing
precious
stuffs
such
as
scarlet
or
purple
or
jewels
thenceforth
the
custom
which
appears
to
have
been
general
throughout
the
greek
cities
and
colonies
prescribed
cheap
robes
with
flowers
or
stripes
of
many
colors
embroidered
or
painted
on
them
to
this
a
part
of
the
women
added
garlands
of
roses
it
was
lawful
in
some
cities
for
courtesans
to
wear
light
transparent
garments
but
at
sparta
as
may
be
imagined
the
reverse
was
the
rule
being
the
badge
of
virtuous
women
perhaps
the
most
singular
of
the
marks
by
which
a
greek
courtesan
was
known
was
her
hair
it
is
said
that
no
law
prescribed
the
habit
if
so
it
must
have
been
a
sort
of
de
which
led
all
courtesans
to
dye
their
hair
of
a
flaxen
or
blonde
color
allusions
to
this
custom
abound
in
the
light
literature
of
greece
frequently
a
flaxen
wig
was
substituted
for
the
dyed
locks
at
a
very
late
period
in
the
history
of
greece
modest
women
followed
the
fashion
of
sporting
golden
hair
this
forms
one
of
the
subjects
of
reprimand
addressed
to
the
women
of
greece
by
the
early
christian
preachers
the
dicteriades
or
common
prostitutes
of
athens
this
class
approaches
more
nearly
than
any
other
to
the
prostitutes
of
our
day
the
main
difference
being
that
the
former
were
bound
by
law
to
prostitute
themselves
when
required
to
do
so
on
the
payment
of
the
fixed
sum
and
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
leave
the
state
their
home
as
mentioned
already
was
properly
at
the
port
of
piræus
an
open
square
in
front
of
the
citadel
was
their
usual
haunt
it
was
surrounded
with
booths
where
petty
trade
or
gambling
was
carried
on
by
day
at
nightfall
the
prostitutes
swarmed
into
the
square
some
were
noisy
and
obscene
others
quiet
and
armed
with
affected
modesty
when
a
man
passed
on
his
way
from
the
port
to
the
city
the
troop
assailed
him
if
he
resisted
coarse
abuse
was
lavished
on
him
if
he
yielded
there
was
the
temple
of
venus
the
courtesan
close
by
and
there
was
the
wall
of
themistocles
under
the
friendly
shelter
of
either
of
which
the
bargain
could
be
consummated
were
the
customer
nice
the
great
dicterion
was
not
far
distant
and
a
score
or
more
of
smaller
rivals
were
even
nearer
at
hand
as
a
sign
was
there
to
testify
the
dicteria
were
under
the
control
of
the
municipal
police
the
door
was
open
night
and
day
a
bright
curtain
protecting
the
inmates
from
the
eye
of
the
and
in
the
better
class
of
establishments
a
fierce
dog
chained
in
the
vestibule
served
as
sentinel
at
the
curtain
sat
an
old
woman
often
a
thessalian
and
a
pretended
witch
who
received
the
money
before
admitting
visitors
originally
the
fee
was
an
obolus
about
three
cents
but
this
attempt
to
regulate
the
value
of
a
variable
merchandise
was
soon
abandoned
within
at
night
the
sounds
of
music
revelry
and
dancing
might
be
constantly
heard
the
visitor
was
not
kept
in
suspense
the
curtain
passed
he
was
in
full
view
of
the
dicteriades
standing
sitting
or
lying
about
the
room
some
engaged
in
smoothing
their
blonde
hair
some
in
conversation
some
anointing
themselves
with
perfumery
the
legal
principle
with
regard
to
the
dicteriades
appears
to
have
been
that
they
should
conceal
nothing
no
doubt
in
contrast
to
the
irregular
prostitutes
of
whom
something
will
be
said
presently
there
was
no
rule
however
forbidding
the
wearing
of
garments
in
the
dicterion
but
the
common
practice
appears
to
have
been
to
dispense
with
them
or
to
wear
a
light
scarf
thrown
over
the
person
this
custom
was
observed
by
day
as
well
as
by
night
and
a
visitor
has
described
the
girls
in
a
large
dicterion
as
standing
in
a
row
in
broad
daylight
without
any
robes
or
covering
it
seems
that
in
later
times
any
speculator
had
a
right
to
set
up
a
dicterion
on
paying
the
tax
to
the
state
an
athenian
forfeited
his
right
of
citizenship
by
so
doing
but
as
a
popular
establishment
was
very
lucrative
avaricious
men
frequently
embarked
in
the
business
under
an
assumed
name
comic
writers
have
lashed
these
wretches
severely
on
paying
the
tax
to
the
state
regularly
the
or
master
of
the
house
acquired
certain
rights
the
dicterion
was
an
inviolable
asylum
no
husband
being
allowed
to
pursue
his
wife
or
the
wife
her
husband
or
the
creditor
his
debtor
within
its
walls
public
decency
requires
says
demosthenes
that
men
shall
not
be
exposed
in
houses
of
prostitution
it
was
not
however
considered
wholly
shameful
to
frequent
such
places
there
appear
to
have
been
attached
to
these
dicteria
schools
of
prostitution
where
young
women
were
initiated
into
the
most
disgusting
practices
by
females
who
had
themselves
acquired
them
in
the
same
manner
alexis
vigorously
describes
the
frauds
taught
in
these
places
while
there
is
a
shocking
significance
in
an
expression
of
athenæus
you
will
be
well
satisfied
with
the
performance
of
the
women
in
the
dicteria
besides
these
regular
dicteriades
there
were
at
athens
as
there
have
been
in
every
large
city
a
number
of
women
who
exercised
the
calling
of
prostitutes
without
properly
belonging
to
any
of
the
recognized
classes
they
were
sometimes
called
free
dicteriades
sometimes
and
also
cheap
hetairæ
some
were
native
athenians
who
had
been
seduced
and
abandoned
and
who
led
by
stings
of
conscience
and
idleness
to
pursue
their
career
had
still
an
invincible
repugnance
to
adopt
the
flowered
robe
and
yellow
hair
of
the
regular
courtesan
they
roamed
the
piræus
and
even
the
streets
of
athens
after
dark
eking
out
a
miserable
subsistence
by
the
hardest
of
trades
and
haunting
the
dark
recesses
of
old
houses
or
the
shade
of
trees
others
again
were
old
hetairæ
whose
charms
had
faded
and
who
sought
a
scanty
subsistence
where
they
were
not
known
and
shrank
from
encountering
the
eye
of
a
lover
where
the
friendly
shade
of
night
would
not
hide
the
ravages
of
time
others
were
the
servants
of
hotels
and
taverns
who
were
always
expected
to
serve
the
caprices
of
visitors
all
of
these
led
a
most
miserable
life
now
and
then
we
hear
of
one
or
two
of
them
meeting
a
rich
and
inexperienced
traveler
after
which
the
heroine
of
the
exploit
naturally
ascended
to
the
rank
of
hetaira
but
in
general
their
customers
were
the
lowest
of
the
port
people
sailors
fishermen
their
price
was
a
meal
a
fish
a
handful
of
fruit
or
a
bottle
of
wine
one
poor
creature
who
belonged
to
no
class
in
particular
but
acquired
some
celebrity
by
being
kept
by
the
orator
ithatocles
was
named
didrachma
because
she
offered
her
favors
to
the
public
generally
for
two
drachmas
about
cents
perhaps
the
most
curious
fact
in
reference
to
these
prostitutes
is
the
singular
predominance
of
old
women
among
them
it
appears
to
have
been
adopted
as
an
invariable
rule
for
this
sort
of
courtesans
to
paint
their
faces
with
a
thick
ointment
and
it
is
even
said
that
the
great
painters
of
greece
did
not
disdain
to
beguile
their
leisure
hours
by
thus
improving
upon
nature
of
course
under
this
disguise
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
a
young
face
from
an
old
one
an
aged
prostitute
thus
bedizened
would
place
herself
at
an
open
window
with
a
sprig
of
myrtle
in
her
hand
with
which
she
would
beckon
to
people
in
the
street
when
a
customer
was
found
a
servant
would
open
the
door
and
conduct
him
in
silence
to
the
chamber
of
her
mistress
before
entering
he
paid
the
sum
demanded
when
he
found
himself
in
a
room
lighted
only
by
a
feeble
glimmer
passing
through
the
curtain
which
now
hung
down
over
the
window
in
such
a
twilight
the
most
venerable
old
woman
could
not
be
distinguished
from
a
venus
the
auletrides
or
female
were
a
common
accompaniment
to
an
athenian
banquet
the
flute
which
in
modern
times
is
played
by
men
was
rarely
seen
in
male
hands
in
greece
though
the
fable
ascribed
its
invention
to
the
god
pan
and
its
development
to
the
mythical
king
midas
it
was
monopolized
at
a
very
early
period
by
women
who
consoled
themselves
for
the
ravages
it
wrought
in
their
beauty
by
the
power
of
fascination
it
imparted
among
a
people
intensely
musical
soon
became
an
essential
rite
in
the
service
of
certain
deities
ceres
was
invariably
worshiped
to
the
sound
of
the
flute
and
when
the
athenians
had
once
tried
the
experiment
of
listening
to
after
dinner
they
never
would
dine
in
company
without
them
thebes
appears
to
have
been
the
native
city
of
the
earliest
famous
but
before
long
the
superior
beauty
of
the
asiatic
girls
ionians
and
phrygians
drove
their
theban
rivals
out
of
the
field
dancing
was
combined
with
and
in
this
art
the
asiatics
bore
the
palm
from
the
world
during
the
golden
days
of
greece
numbers
of
beautiful
girls
were
every
year
imported
into
athens
from
miletus
and
the
other
ionic
ports
in
asia
minor
just
as
in
more
modern
times
a
similar
trade
was
carried
on
between
trebizond
and
constantinople
an
athenian
hired
his
as
a
modern
european
noble
hires
his
band
they
charged
so
much
for
their
musical
performances
reserving
the
right
of
accepting
presents
in
the
course
of
the
evening
some
were
singers
as
well
as
performers
at
each
course
a
new
air
was
played
increasing
in
tenderness
and
expression
as
the
wine
circulated
it
is
stated
that
the
sounds
of
a
good
excited
people
to
such
a
state
of
phrensy
that
they
would
take
off
their
rings
and
jeweled
ornaments
to
throw
them
to
the
performers
those
who
have
witnessed
a
triumphant
operatic
soirée
can
readily
believe
the
statement
but
the
fair
artists
did
not
wholly
rely
on
their
music
for
their
success
the
performer
danced
while
she
played
accompanying
every
note
with
a
harmonious
movement
of
the
body
there
is
no
doubt
these
dances
were
in
the
highest
degree
immoral
and
lascivious
athenæus
tells
a
story
of
an
embassy
from
arcadia
waiting
upon
king
antigonus
and
being
invited
to
dinner
after
the
hunger
of
the
venerable
guests
was
appeased
phrygian
were
introduced
they
were
draped
in
veils
arranged
with
much
coquetry
at
the
given
signal
they
began
to
play
and
dance
balancing
themselves
alternately
on
each
foot
and
gradually
increasing
the
rapidity
of
their
movements
as
the
performance
went
on
the
dancers
uncovered
their
heads
then
their
busts
lastly
they
threw
the
veils
aside
altogether
and
stood
before
the
wondering
embassadors
with
only
a
short
tunic
around
the
loins
in
this
state
they
danced
so
indecently
that
the
aged
arcadians
excited
beyond
control
forgot
where
they
were
and
rushed
upon
them
the
king
laughed
the
courtiers
were
shocked
at
such
but
the
dancers
discharged
the
sacred
duty
of
hospitality
a
who
had
achieved
a
success
of
this
kind
was
enabled
to
conclude
a
lucrative
bargain
for
other
performances
we
find
allusions
to
fees
as
high
as
two
talents
say
and
fifty
pieces
of
gold
though
these
were
evidently
unusual
charges
many
of
the
most
fashionable
were
slaves
who
had
been
brought
to
greece
by
speculators
they
were
commonly
sold
by
auction
at
the
when
their
owner
judged
that
the
enthusiasm
of
the
guests
had
attained
the
highest
point
an
anecdote
is
told
of
one
of
the
most
esteemed
names
in
greek
philosophy
in
reference
to
this
strange
custom
he
was
dining
with
a
party
of
young
men
when
a
youthful
was
introduced
she
crept
to
the
philosopher
feet
and
seemed
to
shelter
herself
from
insult
under
the
shadow
of
his
venerable
beard
but
he
a
disciple
of
zeno
spurned
her
and
burst
forth
into
a
strain
of
moralizing
piqued
by
the
affront
the
girl
rose
and
played
and
danced
with
inimitable
grace
and
pruriency
at
the
close
of
the
performance
her
owner
put
her
up
to
auction
and
one
of
the
first
bidders
was
the
philosopher
she
was
adjudged
to
another
however
and
the
sage
so
far
forgot
his
principles
as
to
engage
in
a
fierce
conflict
with
the
victor
for
the
possession
of
the
prize
hand
to
hand
battles
on
these
occasions
were
common
in
the
best
society
at
athens
and
a
in
fashion
made
a
boast
of
the
riots
she
had
caused
of
the
fortunes
realized
by
successful
artists
in
this
line
an
idea
may
be
formed
from
the
gorgeous
presents
made
to
the
delphian
oracle
by
and
from
the
fact
that
the
finest
houses
at
alexandria
were
inscribed
with
the
names
of
famous
greek
auletrides
as
might
be
inferred
from
the
character
of
their
dances
the
auletrides
were
capable
of
every
infamy
constantly
breathing
an
atmosphere
of
debauchery
and
accustomed
to
the
daily
spectacle
of
nudities
they
naturally
attained
a
pitch
of
amorous
exaltation
of
which
we
at
the
present
day
can
hardly
form
an
idea
they
kept
a
cherished
festival
in
honor
of
venus
peribasia
which
was
originally
established
by
cypselus
of
corinth
at
that
ceremony
all
the
great
of
greece
assembled
to
celebrate
their
calling
men
were
not
usually
allowed
to
be
present
a
regulation
prompted
perhaps
by
modesty
as
the
judgment
of
paris
was
renewed
at
the
festival
and
prizes
were
awarded
for
every
description
of
beauty
the
ceremony
was
often
mentioned
as
the
callipygian
games
and
a
sketch
of
a
scene
which
took
place
at
one
of
these
reunions
contained
in
a
letter
from
a
famous
justifies
the
appellation
the
banquet
lasted
from
dark
till
dawn
with
wines
perfumes
delicate
viands
songs
and
music
an
was
a
dispute
between
two
of
the
guests
as
to
their
respective
beauty
a
trial
was
demanded
by
the
company
and
a
long
and
graphic
account
is
given
of
the
exhibition
but
modern
tastes
will
not
allow
us
to
transcribe
the
details
a
knowledge
of
these
scandalous
scenes
it
may
be
briefly
observed
would
be
worse
than
useless
were
it
not
that
they
illustrate
the
life
of
greek
courtesans
and
being
performed
under
the
sanction
of
religion
and
the
law
they
throw
no
inconsiderable
light
on
the
real
character
of
greek
society
their
value
may
be
best
apprehended
by
trying
to
realize
what
the
effect
would
be
if
similar
scenes
occurred
annually
in
some
public
edifice
in
our
large
cities
under
the
auspices
of
the
police
with
the
approval
of
the
clergy
and
with
the
full
knowledge
of
the
best
female
society
it
has
been
suggested
that
these
festivals
were
originated
by
or
gave
rise
to
those
enormous
aberrations
of
the
greek
female
mind
known
to
the
ancients
as
lesbian
love
there
is
no
doubt
grave
reason
to
believe
something
of
the
kind
indeed
lucian
affirms
that
while
avarice
prompted
common
pleasures
taste
and
feeling
inclined
the
toward
their
own
sex
on
so
repulsive
a
theme
it
is
unnecessary
to
enlarge
many
seem
to
have
been
susceptible
of
lasting
affections
in
the
remains
we
have
of
the
erotic
works
of
the
greeks
several
names
are
mentioned
as
those
of
successful
whose
gains
were
consumed
by
exacting
lovers
it
does
not
appear
that
they
often
or
ever
married
the
most
famous
of
all
the
was
lamia
who
after
being
the
delight
of
alexandria
and
of
king
ptolemy
for
some
fifteen
or
twenty
years
was
taken
with
the
city
by
demetrius
of
macedon
and
raised
to
the
rank
of
his
mistress
she
was
forty
years
of
age
at
this
time
yet
her
skill
was
such
that
she
ruled
despotically
her
dissolute
lover
and
left
a
memorable
name
in
greek
history
the
ancients
asserted
that
she
owed
her
name
lamia
which
means
a
sort
of
vampire
or
bloodsucker
to
the
most
loathsome
depravities
her
power
was
so
great
that
when
demetrius
levied
a
tax
of
some
on
the
city
of
athens
he
gave
the
whole
to
her
to
buy
her
soap
as
he
said
the
athenians
revenged
themselves
by
saying
that
lamia
person
must
be
very
dirty
since
she
needed
so
much
soap
to
wash
it
but
they
soon
found
it
to
their
interest
to
build
a
temple
in
her
honor
and
deify
her
under
the
name
of
venus
lamia
the
hetairæ
or
kept
women
the
hetairæ
were
by
far
the
most
important
class
of
women
in
greece
they
filled
so
large
a
place
in
society
that
virtuous
females
were
entirely
thrown
into
the
shade
and
it
must
have
been
quite
possible
for
a
chaste
athenian
girl
endowed
with
ambition
to
look
up
to
them
and
covet
their
splendid
infamy
an
athenian
matron
was
expected
to
live
at
home
she
was
not
allowed
to
be
present
at
the
games
or
the
theatres
she
was
bound
when
she
appeared
in
public
to
be
veiled
and
to
hasten
whither
she
was
going
without
delay
she
received
no
education
and
could
not
share
the
elevated
thoughts
or
ideas
of
her
husband
she
had
no
right
to
claim
any
warmth
of
affection
from
him
though
he
possessed
entire
control
over
her
now
to
judge
of
the
position
into
which
this
social
system
thrust
the
female
sex
one
must
glance
at
the
mythology
or
to
speak
more
correctly
at
the
religious
faith
of
the
greek
people
it
has
been
conjectured
that
they
derived
their
idea
of
venus
from
the
east
however
this
be
venus
was
certainly
one
of
the
earliest
goddesses
to
whom
their
homage
was
paid
solon
erected
opposite
his
dicterion
a
temple
to
venus
pandemos
or
the
public
venus
in
that
temple
were
two
statues
one
of
the
goddess
the
other
of
a
nymph
pitho
who
presided
over
persuasion
and
the
attitudes
and
execution
of
the
statues
were
such
that
they
explained
the
character
without
inscription
at
this
temple
a
festival
was
held
on
the
fourth
of
each
month
to
which
all
the
men
of
athens
were
invited
but
venus
pandemos
soon
made
way
for
newer
and
more
barefaced
rivals
twenty
temples
were
raised
in
various
cities
of
greece
to
venus
the
courtesan
in
one
author
we
find
allusion
made
to
venus
mucheia
or
the
venus
of
houses
of
another
celebrates
venus
castnia
or
the
goddess
of
indecency
others
honor
venus
scotia
the
patroness
of
darkness
and
venus
derceto
the
guardian
deity
of
more
famous
still
was
venus
divaricatrix
whose
surname
derived
it
is
said
by
a
father
of
the
church
divaricatis
must
be
left
in
a
learned
tongue
and
still
more
renowned
was
venus
callipyge
whose
statue
is
at
this
day
one
of
the
choice
ornaments
of
one
of
the
best
european
collections
of
antiquities
it
owed
its
charm
to
the
marvelous
beauty
of
the
limbs
and
was
understood
to
have
been
designed
from
two
syracusan
sisters
whose
extraordinary
symmetry
in
this
particular
had
been
noticed
by
a
countryman
who
surprised
them
while
bathing
all
these
venuses
had
temples
and
sacrifices
and
priestesses
their
worship
was
naturally
analogous
to
their
name
and
consistent
with
their
history
their
devotees
were
every
man
in
greece
yet
it
was
in
this
society
trained
to
such
spectacles
and
nurtured
in
such
a
creed
that
matrons
and
maidens
were
taught
to
lead
a
life
of
purity
seclusion
and
the
consequence
was
obvious
while
ignorance
and
forcible
restraint
prevented
the
women
from
generally
breaking
loose
the
men
grew
more
and
more
addicted
to
the
society
of
hetairæ
and
more
liable
to
regard
their
wives
as
mere
articles
of
furniture
nor
was
the
anomaly
without
effect
upon
the
kept
women
they
alone
of
their
sex
saw
the
plays
of
alexander
and
aristophanes
they
alone
had
the
of
the
studio
of
phidias
and
apelles
they
alone
heard
socrates
reason
and
discussed
politics
with
pericles
they
alone
shared
in
the
intellectual
movement
of
greece
no
women
but
hetairæ
drove
through
the
streets
with
uncovered
face
and
gorgeous
apparel
none
but
they
mingled
in
the
assemblages
of
great
men
at
the
pnyx
or
the
stoa
none
but
they
could
gather
round
them
of
an
evening
the
choicest
spirits
of
the
day
and
elicit
in
the
freedom
of
unrestrained
intercourse
wit
and
wisdom
flashing
fancy
and
burning
eloquence
what
wonder
that
the
hetairæ
should
have
filled
so
prominent
a
part
in
greek
society
and
how
small
a
compensation
to
virtuous
women
to
know
that
their
rivals
could
not
stand
by
the
altar
when
sacrifice
was
offered
could
not
give
birth
to
a
citizen
there
are
many
reasons
besides
these
why
the
contest
was
unequal
tradition
reported
several
occasions
on
which
hetairæ
had
rendered
signal
service
to
the
state
leæna
for
instance
the
mistress
of
harmodius
had
bitten
off
her
tongue
rather
than
reveal
the
names
of
her
recollections
like
these
more
than
nullified
the
nominal
brand
of
the
law
again
every
wise
legislator
saw
the
necessity
of
encouraging
any
form
of
rational
intercourse
in
order
to
arrest
the
startling
progress
which
the
most
degrading
of
enormities
was
making
in
greece
when
alcibiades
was
openly
courted
by
the
first
philosophers
and
statesmen
it
was
virtue
to
applaud
aspasia
and
besides
it
can
not
be
questioned
in
view
of
the
greek
memoirs
we
possess
that
many
of
the
leading
hetairæ
were
women
of
remarkable
mind
as
well
as
unusual
attractions
indeed
the
leading
trait
in
their
history
is
their
intellectuality
as
contrasted
with
other
classes
of
dissolute
women
in
antiquity
that
trait
can
be
best
illustrated
by
referring
to
the
lives
of
a
few
of
the
more
celebrated
hetairæ
a
milesian
prostitute
named
thargelia
accompanied
xerxes
on
his
invasion
of
greece
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
position
in
society
occupied
by
prostitutes
from
the
fact
that
xerxes
employed
this
woman
as
negotiator
with
the
court
of
thessaly
just
as
in
later
times
modern
ministers
have
used
duchesses
thargelia
married
the
king
of
thessaly
fired
by
her
success
another
milesian
girl
named
aspasia
established
herself
at
athens
she
set
up
a
house
of
prostitution
and
peopled
it
with
the
most
lovely
girls
of
the
ionic
cities
but
wherein
she
differed
from
her
rivals
and
predecessors
was
the
prominence
she
gave
to
intellect
in
her
establishment
she
lectured
publicly
among
her
girls
and
their
visitors
on
rhetoric
and
philosophy
and
with
such
marked
ability
that
she
counted
among
her
patrons
and
lovers
the
first
men
of
greece
including
socrates
alcibiades
and
pericles
the
last
divorced
his
wife
in
order
to
marry
her
and
was
accused
of
allowing
her
to
govern
athens
then
at
the
height
of
its
power
and
prosperity
she
is
said
to
have
incited
the
war
against
samos
and
the
principal
cause
of
that
against
megara
was
believed
to
have
been
the
rape
by
citizens
of
megara
of
two
of
aspasia
girls
what
a
wonderful
light
these
facts
throw
on
greek
society
enraged
beyond
control
at
her
success
the
virtuous
women
of
athens
rose
against
her
she
was
publicly
insulted
at
the
theatre
was
attacked
in
the
street
and
as
a
last
resort
was
accused
of
impiety
before
the
areopagus
pericles
then
in
the
decline
of
his
power
and
unable
to
save
his
friends
phidias
and
anaxagoras
appeared
as
her
advocate
but
on
such
an
occasion
his
eloquence
failed
him
he
could
only
seize
his
beloved
wife
in
his
arms
press
her
to
his
breast
and
burst
into
tears
in
presence
of
the
court
the
appeal
succeeded
possibly
the
judges
made
allowance
for
popular
prejudice
at
all
events
aspasia
was
acquitted
and
restored
to
society
she
lived
to
be
the
delight
of
a
flour
merchant
under
whose
roof
her
lectures
on
philosophy
were
continued
with
undiminished
success
to
the
day
of
her
death
her
friend
and
the
inheritor
of
her
mantle
hipparchia
led
an
equally
remarkable
life
she
was
an
athenian
by
birth
and
of
good
family
but
having
heard
the
cynic
crates
speak
she
declared
to
her
parents
that
nothing
would
restrain
her
from
yielding
herself
to
him
she
kept
her
word
and
became
the
philosopher
mistress
in
spite
of
his
dirt
his
poverty
and
his
grossness
she
is
reported
to
have
acquired
great
reputation
as
a
practical
professor
of
the
cynic
philosophy
having
engaged
one
day
in
a
fierce
discussion
with
a
somewhat
brutal
philosopher
of
a
rival
sect
the
latter
by
way
of
answer
to
a
question
she
put
violently
exposed
her
person
before
the
whole
assembly
well
said
she
coolly
what
does
that
prove
this
woman
was
one
of
the
most
voluminous
and
esteemed
authors
of
her
day
bacchis
the
mistress
of
the
orator
hyperides
illustrates
the
character
of
the
athenian
kept
woman
from
another
point
of
view
she
was
extremely
beautiful
and
gifted
with
a
sweet
disposition
one
of
her
early
admirers
had
presented
her
with
a
necklace
of
enormous
value
the
first
ladies
of
athens
and
even
foreign
women
of
rank
coveted
the
precious
trinket
in
vain
she
was
in
the
height
of
her
fame
and
charms
when
she
heard
the
orator
hyperides
plead
smitten
on
the
spot
she
became
his
mistress
and
observed
a
fidelity
toward
him
which
was
neither
usual
with
her
class
nor
reciprocated
by
her
lover
on
one
occasion
a
rival
announced
that
the
price
of
her
complaisance
would
be
the
possession
of
the
necklace
of
bacchis
the
lover
had
the
meanness
to
ask
for
it
and
bacchis
gave
it
without
a
word
again
when
all
athens
knew
that
she
was
the
mistress
of
hyperides
an
officious
friend
came
to
tell
her
that
her
lover
was
at
that
moment
making
love
to
another
woman
bacchis
received
the
announcement
tranquilly
what
do
you
intend
to
do
asked
her
visitor
with
impetuosity
to
wait
for
him
was
the
meek
answer
she
died
very
young
and
her
lover
partially
atoned
for
his
ill
treatment
by
pronouncing
a
splendid
oration
over
her
remains
very
few
passages
in
greek
literature
are
marked
by
such
eloquent
tenderness
and
genuine
feeling
as
this
fragment
of
hyperides
gnathena
and
her
heir
and
successor
gnathenion
were
famous
in
their
day
as
wits
the
biography
of
the
first
was
written
in
verse
by
the
poet
machon
she
began
life
as
the
mistress
of
the
comic
poet
dyphiles
but
soon
abandoned
him
to
keep
a
sort
of
for
the
wit
and
fashion
of
athens
the
best
society
gathered
around
her
board
and
at
the
close
of
the
meal
she
sold
herself
by
auction
athenæus
has
chronicled
a
number
of
her
witty
and
sarcastic
sayings
adding
that
the
grace
of
her
elocution
imparted
a
singular
charm
to
every
thing
she
said
her
protegée
gnathenion
grew
up
in
time
to
receive
the
mantle
which
age
was
wresting
from
the
shoulders
of
gnathena
an
anecdote
is
preserved
which
throws
some
light
upon
the
profits
of
the
calling
of
hetairæ
at
the
temple
of
venus
gnathena
and
her
protegée
met
an
old
persian
satrap
richly
clothed
in
purple
who
was
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
latter
and
demanded
her
price
gnathena
answered
a
thousand
drachmas
about
two
hundred
dollars
the
satrap
exclaimed
at
such
extortion
and
offered
five
hundred
observing
that
he
would
return
again
at
your
age
maliciously
retorted
gnathena
once
is
too
much
and
turned
on
her
heel
in
her
old
age
it
appears
that
gnathena
was
reduced
to
the
disgraceful
calling
which
the
greeks
termed
but
the
fame
of
these
hetairæ
is
eclipsed
by
that
of
the
only
two
kept
women
who
can
rank
with
aspasia
lais
and
phryne
lais
was
a
sicilian
by
birth
like
the
empress
catharine
of
russia
she
was
taken
prisoner
when
her
native
city
was
captured
and
sold
as
a
slave
the
painter
apelles
saw
her
carrying
water
from
a
well
and
struck
with
the
beauty
of
her
figure
he
bought
her
and
trained
her
in
his
own
house
this
again
is
a
striking
picture
fancy
a
leading
modern
painter
deliberately
training
a
prostitute
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
apelles
gathered
round
him
the
best
society
in
greece
lais
when
her
education
was
complete
was
as
remarkable
for
wit
and
information
as
for
her
matchless
figure
and
lovely
face
her
master
freed
her
and
established
her
at
corinth
then
in
the
height
of
its
prosperity
and
the
largest
commercial
emporium
of
greece
corinth
and
the
corinthian
prostitutes
deserve
particular
notice
it
appears
that
almost
every
house
in
the
place
was
in
fact
a
house
of
prostitution
there
were
regular
schools
where
the
art
of
debauchery
was
taught
and
frequent
importations
of
young
girls
from
lesbos
phoenicia
and
the
ægean
islands
supplied
them
with
pupils
ancient
erotic
writers
are
full
of
allusions
to
the
danger
of
visiting
corinth
the
proverb
cuivis
homini
contingit
adire
which
most
moderns
have
erroneously
conceived
to
refer
to
lais
alone
was
in
fact
an
adage
justified
by
the
experience
of
merchants
and
sailors
it
would
be
incorrect
however
to
compare
corinth
with
modern
where
the
natural
demands
of
sailors
require
a
cheap
supply
of
women
the
hetairæ
of
corinth
charged
as
high
as
a
talent
say
for
a
single
night
company
and
appears
to
have
been
no
unusual
fee
for
the
common
sailors
the
commercial
shrewdness
of
the
corinthians
had
established
a
temple
to
venus
containing
a
thousand
young
slaves
who
were
obliged
to
prostitute
themselves
for
a
single
obolus
a
cent
it
was
in
this
metropolis
of
prostitution
that
lais
commenced
business
she
soon
rose
to
the
first
rank
in
her
trade
her
capriciousness
gave
additional
value
to
her
charms
even
money
could
not
purchase
her
when
it
was
her
whim
not
to
yield
she
refused
from
the
orator
demosthenes
who
had
actually
turned
his
property
into
money
to
lay
it
at
her
feet
but
she
yielded
gratuitously
to
the
muddy
ragged
cynic
diogenes
and
graciously
shared
the
patrimony
of
the
philosopher
aristippus
to
the
latter
who
occupied
no
mean
rank
in
greek
society
a
remark
was
made
to
the
effect
that
he
ought
to
debar
his
mistress
from
promiscuous
intercourse
for
his
own
sake
he
replied
phlegmatically
would
you
object
to
live
in
a
house
or
sail
in
a
ship
because
others
had
just
preceded
you
in
the
one
or
the
other
xenocrates
the
disciple
of
plato
resisted
lais
successfully
she
had
made
a
wager
that
she
would
overcome
his
stoical
coldness
rushing
into
his
house
one
evening
in
affected
terror
she
besought
an
asylum
as
she
said
thieves
had
chased
her
the
philosopher
sternly
bade
her
fear
nothing
she
sat
silent
till
xenocrates
went
to
bed
then
throwing
off
her
dress
and
revealing
all
her
wonderful
beauty
she
placed
herself
at
his
side
he
gruffly
submitted
to
this
encroachment
growing
bolder
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
caressed
him
and
exhausted
her
arts
of
fascination
but
xenocrates
remained
unmoved
i
wagered
she
cried
to
rouse
a
man
not
a
statue
and
springing
from
the
couch
she
resumed
her
dress
and
disappeared
the
people
of
corinth
desired
to
possess
her
statue
and
having
spent
her
money
in
embellishing
the
city
perhaps
she
was
entitled
to
this
mark
of
respect
myron
the
sculptor
was
deputed
to
model
her
charms
he
was
old
and
gray
but
so
fascinating
was
her
beauty
that
at
his
second
visit
he
laid
at
her
feet
all
the
savings
of
his
life
the
haughty
courtesan
spurned
him
he
went
away
placed
himself
in
the
hands
of
a
skillful
perfumer
had
his
hair
and
beard
dyed
and
his
appearance
rejuvenated
then
he
renewed
his
suit
my
poor
friend
said
lais
with
a
bitter
smile
you
are
asking
what
i
refused
yesterday
to
your
father
in
old
age
lais
had
leisure
to
repent
of
her
caprices
she
had
spent
her
money
as
fast
as
she
made
it
and
she
retained
her
calling
long
after
her
charms
had
vanished
epicrates
has
drawn
a
melancholy
picture
of
a
drunken
old
woman
wandering
over
the
quay
at
corinth
and
seeking
to
sell
for
three
cents
what
had
once
been
considered
cheap
at
a
thousand
dollars
such
was
the
end
of
lais
phryne
was
more
fortunate
she
husbanded
her
attractions
with
judgment
and
to
the
close
of
her
long
life
retained
her
rank
and
her
value
her
wealth
was
such
that
when
alexander
destroyed
thebes
she
offered
to
rebuild
the
city
at
her
own
expense
provided
the
thebans
would
commemorate
the
fact
by
an
inscription
they
refused
she
had
counted
among
her
lovers
the
most
famous
men
of
the
day
among
whom
were

orator
hyperides
whose
successful
defense
of
his
mistress
has
already
been
mentioned
the
painter
apelles
and
the
sculptor
praxiteles
it
was
to
her
that
the
latter
gave
his
crowning
work
his
cupid
he
and
apelles
were
both
privileged
to
admire
and
reproduce
her
nude
charms
a
privilege
rigorously
denied
even
to
the
most
opulent
of
her
lovers
phryne
was
a
prodigious
favorite
with
the
athenian
people
she
played
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
festival
of
neptune
and
venus
at
a
certain
point
in
the
ceremony
she
appeared
on
the
steps
of
the
temple

the

her
usual

and
slowly
disrobed
herself
in

of

next
advanced

into

and
offered
sacrifice
to

returning
like
a
drying
her
hair
from
which
the
water
dripped
over
her
exquisite
limbs
she
paused
for
a
moment
before
the
crowd
which
shouted
in
a
phrensy
of
enthusiasm
as

some
years

of

she
was

of

were
undeniable

no

was
ever

her

cost
and
historians
admiring
in
after
ages
its
splendor
and
its
size
inquired
with
mock
wonder
whether
the
bones
of
a
miltiades
or
a
cimon
or
a
pericles
lay
under
the
pile
harpalus
found
consolation
in
the
arms
of
a
greek
named
glycera
for
aught
we
know
the
poisoner
of
pythionice
she
too
became
queen
of
babylon
issued
her
decrees
held
her
court
submitted
to
be
worshiped
and
saw
her
statue
of
bronze
as
large
as
life
erected
in
the
babylonian
temples
she
was
a
woman
of
a
masculine
mind
in
a
feminine
body
when
alexander
returned
from
the
east
breathing
vengeance
against
faithless
servants
she
compelled
her
lover
to
fly
with
her
to
attica
where
she
raised
by
her
eloquence
her
money
and
her
address
an
army
of
six
thousand
men
to
oppose
the
hero
of
macedon
it
is
said
that
she
purchased
at
what
price
we
know
not
the
silence
of
demosthenes
she
certainly
bribed
the
athenian
people
with
large
donations
of
corn
but
she
could
not
bribe
or
persuade
her
wretched
lover
to
be
sensible
his
folly
soon
roused
the
athenians
against
him
and
he
was
exiled
with
his
mistress
in
this
exile
one
of
his
attendants
cut
the
throat
of
the
venerable
lover
and
glycera
left
a
widow
returned
to
athens
to
pursue
her
calling
as
a
hetaira
she
was
no
longer
young
and
needed
the
aid
of
the
dealer
in
cosmetics
but
her
prestige
as
the
of
babylon
procured
her
a
certain
celebrity
and
she
soon
obtained
a
position
in
the
society
of
athens
out
of
a
crowd
of
admirers
who
attached
themselves
to
her
court
she
chose
two
to
be
as
the
french
would
say
her
de
one
was
the
painter
pausias
the
other
the
comic
poet
menander
the
former
achieved
one
of
his
most
brilliant
triumphs
by
painting
the
portrait
of
his
mistress
but
whether
his
temper
was
not
congenial
to
hers
or
his
rival
inspired
an
exclusive
affection
glycera
soon
discarded
pausias
and
became
the
mistress
of
the
poet
alone
menander
we
are
led
to
believe
was
a
man
of
a
harsh
crabbed
disposition
the
haughty
glycera
was
the
only
one
whom
his
never
irritated
who
bore
with
all
his
ill
temper
when
he
was
successful
she
heightened
his
joy
when
his
plays
were
ill
received
and
he
returned
from
the
theatre
in
low
spirits
she
consoled
him
and
endured
the
keenest
affronts
without
murmuring
her
amiability
had
its
reward
from
being
one
of
the
most
dissolute
men
of
athens
menander
became
solidly
attached
and
faithful
to
glycera
and
so
soon
was
her
babylonish
career
forgotten
she
descended
to
posterity
in
the
athenian
heart
inseparably
coupled
with
the
dearest
of
their
comic
writers
another
famous
hetaira
was
leontium
who
succeeded
her
mistress
philenis
in
the
affections
of
the
philosopher
epicurus
she
is
said
to
have
borne
him
a
daughter
who
was
born
in
the
shade
of
a
grove
in
his
garden
but
whether
she
put
her
own
construction
upon
the
epicurean
philosophy
or
did
not
really
love
the
teacher
she
was
far
from
practicing
the
fidelity
which
was
due
to
so
distinguished
a
lover
she
figures
in
the
letters
of
alciphron
as
the
tender
friend
of
several
younger
fashionables
and
she
has
been
accused
with
what
truth
it
is
hard
to
say
of
attempting
a
compromise
between
the
doctrines
of
epicurus
and
those
of
diogenes
however
this
be
leontium
was
undoubtedly
a
woman
of
rare
ability
and
remarkable
taste
she
composed
several
works
among
others
one
against
theophrastus
which
excited
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
so
good
a
judge
as
cicero
she
survived
her
old
protector
and
died
in
obscurity
something
more
might
be
said
of
archeanassa
to
whose
wrinkles
plato
did
not
disdain
to
compose
an
amorous
epigram
of
theoris
a
beautiful
girl
who
preferred
the
glorious
old
age
of
sophocles
to
the
ardent
youth
of
demosthenes
and
whom
the
vindictive
orator
punished
by
having
her
condemned
to
death
of
archippa
the
last
mistress
and
sole
heir
of
sophocles
of
theodote
the
disciple
of
socrates
under
whose
counsels
she
carried
on
her
business
as
a
courtesan
and
whose
death
may
be
ascribed
in
some
part
to
the
spite
caused
by
theodote
rejection
of
aristophanes
and
of
others
who
figure
largely
in
every
reliable
history
of
intellectual
greece
but
we
must
stop
in
most
of
the
nations
to
which
reference
must
be
made
in
the
ensuing
pages
of
this
volume
prostitutes
have
figured
as
pariahs
in
greece
they
were
an
aristocracy
exercising
a
palpable
influence
over
the
national
policy
and
social
life
and
mingling
conspicuously
in
the
great
march
of
the
greek
intellect
no
less
than
eleven
authors
of
repute
have
employed
their
talents
as
historiographers
of
courtesans
at
athens
their
works
have
not
reached
us
entire
having
fallen
victims
to
the
chaste
scruples
of
the
clergy
of
the
middle
ages
but
enough
remains
in
the
quotations
of
athenæus
alciphron
letters
lucian
diogenes
laertius
aristophanes
aristænetus
and
others
to
enable
us
to
form
a
far
more
accurate
idea
of
the
athenian
hetairæ
than
we
can
obtain
of
the
prostitutes
of
the
last
generation
into
the
arts
practiced
by
the
graduates
of
the
corinthian
academies
it
is
hardly
possible
to
enter
at
least
in
a
modern
tongue
even
the
greeks
were
obliged
to
invent
verbs
to
designate
the
monstrosities
practiced
by
the
lesbian
and
phoenician
women
demosthenes
pleading
successfully
against
the
courtesan
neæra
describes
her
as
having
seven
young
girls
in
her
house
whom
she
knew
well
how
to
train
for
their
calling
as
was
proved
by
the
repeated
sales
of
their
virginity
one
may
form
an
idea
of
the
shocking
depravity
of
the
reigning
taste
from
the
sneers
which
were
lavished
upon
phryne
and
bacchis
who
steadily
adhered
to
natural
pleasures
the
use
of
philtres
or
charms
of
which
more
will
be
said
in
the
ensuing
chapter
on
roman
prostitution
was
common
in
greece
retired
courtesans
often
combined
the
manufacture
of
these
supposed
charms
with
the
business
of
a
midwife
they
made
potions
which
excited
love
and
potions
which
destroyed
it
charms
to
turn
love
into
hate
and
others
to
convert
hate
into
love
that
the
efficacy
of
the
latter
must
have
been
a
matter
of
pure
faith
need
not
be
demonstrated
though
the
belief
in
them
was
general
and
profound
the
former
are
well
known
in
the
pharmacopoeia
and
from
the
accounts
given
of
their
effects
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
they
were
successfully
employed
in
greece
as
well
by
jealous
husbands
and
suspicious
fathers
as
by
ardent
lovers
a
case
is
mentioned
by
no
less
an
authority
than
aristotle
of
a
woman
who
contrived
to
administer
an
amorous
potion
to
her
lover
who
died
of
it
the
woman
was
tried
for
murder
but
it
being
satisfactorily
proved
that
her
intention
was
not
to
cause
death
but
to
revive
an
extinct
love
she
was
acquitted
other
cases
are
mentioned
in
which
the
philtres
produced
madness
instead
of
love
similar
accidents

our
earliest
acquaintance
with
the
roman
laws
governing
prostitution
dates
from
the
reign
of
the
emperor
augustus
but
there
is
abundant
evidence
to
show
that
prostitutes
were
common
in
the
city
of
rome
at
the
time
when
authentic
history
begins
it
does
not
appear
that
religious
prostitution
was
ever
domiciled
in
italy
though
in
later
times
the
festivals
in
honor
of
certain
deities
were
scandalously
loose
and
to
judge
from
the
etruscan
paintings
the
morals
of
the
indigenous
italians
must
have
been
disgustingly
depraved
in
the
comedies
of
plautus
which
are
among
the
oldest
works
of
roman
literature
which
have
reached
us
the
prostitute
and
the
bawd
figure
conspicuously
they
were
thus
evidently
in
the
third
century
before
christ
characters
in
roman
society
when
the
floralian
games
were
instituted
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
no
credit
whatever
must
be
placed
in
the
puerile
stories
of
lactantius
about
the
courtesans
acca
laurentia
and
flora
but
it
is
certain
that
the
chief
attraction
of
these
infamous
celebrations
was
the
appearance
of
prostitutes
on
the
stage
in
a
state
of
nudity
and
their
lascivious
dances
in
the
presence
of
the
people
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
story
that
the
performance
was
suspended
during
the
presence
of
the
stern
moralist
cato
that
they
had
been
long
practiced
before
his
time
indeed
it
would
not
be
presuming
too
far
to
decide
without
other
evidence
that
prostitution
must
have
become
a
fixed
fact
at
rome
very
shortly
after
the
romans
began
to
mix
freely
with
the
greek
colonists
at
tarentum
and
the
other
greek
cities
in
italy
that
is
to
say
about
the
beginning
of
the
third
century
before
christ
we
learn
from
tacitus
that
from
time
immemorial
prostitutes
had
been
required
to
register
themselves
in
the
office
of
the
ædile
the
ceremony
appears
to
have
been
very
similar
to
that
now
imposed
by
law
on
french
prostitutes
the
woman
designing
to
become
a
prostitute
presented
herself
before
the
ædile
gave
her
age
place
of
birth
and
real
name
with
the
one
she
assumed
if
she
adopted
a
pseudonyme
the
public
officer
if
she
was
young
or
apparently
respectable
did
his
best
to
combat
her
resolution
failing
in
this
he
issued
to
her
a
license
ascertained
the
sum
which
she
was
to
demand
from
her
customers
and
entered
her
name
in
his
roll
it
might
be
inferred
from
a
law
of
justinian
that
a
prostitute
was
bound
to
take
an
oath
on
obtaining
her
license
to
discharge
the
duties
of
her
calling
to
the
end
of
her
life
for
the
law
in
question
very
properly
decided
that
an
oath
so
obviously
at
war
with
good
morals
was
not
binding
however
this
was
the
prostitute
once
inscribed
incurred
the
taint
of
infamy
which
nothing
could
wipe
off
repentance
was
impossible
even
when
she
married
and
became
the
mother
of
legitimate
children
the
fatal
inscription
was
still
there
to
bear
witness
of
her
infamy
in
rome
as
in
so
many
other
countries
the
principle
of
the
law
was
to
close
the
door
to
reform
and
to
render
vice
hopeless
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
that
these
regulations
were
in
force
at
a
very
early
period
of
the
republic
of
the
further
rules
established
under
the
imperial
regime
we
shall
speak
presently
meanwhile
it
may
be
observed
that
there
is
ground
for
hoping
that
at
the
best
age
of
the
republic
the
public
morals
were
not
generally
corrupt
the
old
stories
of
lucretia
and
virginia
would
have
had
no
point
among
a
demoralized
people
all
who
are
familiar
with
roman
history
will
remember
the
fierce
contest
waged
by
cato
the
censor
against
the
jewels
fine
dresses
and
carriages
of
the
roman
ladies
an
indication
that
graver
delinquencies
did
not
call
for
official
interference
this
same
cato
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
cohabited
with
a
female
slave
but
though
concubinage
was
recognized
by
the
roman
law
and
would
seem
to
have
involved
no
disgrace
at
a
later
period
the
intrigue
no
sooner
became
known
than
the
old
censor
married
a
second
wife
to
avoid
scandal
a
similar
inference
may
be
drawn
from
the
strange
story
told
by
livy
of
the
bacchanalian
mysteries
introduced
into
rome
by
foreigners
about
the
beginning
of
the
second
century
before
christ
it
is
not
easy
at
this
late
day
to
discover
what
is
true
and
what
false
in
the
statement
he
gives
but
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
that
young
persons
of
both
sexes
under
the
impulse
of
sensuality
had
established
societies
for
the
purpose
among
others
of
satisfying
depraved
instincts
to
what
extent
the
mania
had
extended
it
is
not
possible
to
judge
the
numbers
given
by
the
latin
writers
are
not
very
trustworthy
but
we
may
learn
how
strong
was
the
moral
sentiment
of
the
roman
people
from
the
very
stringent
decree
which
the
senate
issued
on
motion
of
the
consul
postumius
and
from
the
indiscriminate
executions
of
parties
implicated
in
the
mysterious
rites
other
evidences
of
the
purity
of
roman
morals
might
be
found
if
they
were
wanting
in
the
remarkable
fidelity
with
which
the
vestals
observed
their
oaths
in
the
tone
of
the
speeches
of
the
statesmen
of
the
time
in
the
high
character
sustained
by
such
matrons
as
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
and
finally
in
the
legislation
of
augustus
which
professed
rather
to
affirm
and
improve
the
old
laws
than
to
introduce
new
principles
as
we
approach
the
christian
era
the
picture
gradually
darkens
civil
wars
are
usually
fatal
to
private
virtue
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
the
age
of
sylla
and
clodius
was
by
no
means
a
moral
one
sylla
the
dictator
openly
led
a
life
of
scandalous
debauchery
clodius
the
tribune
is
accused
by
cicero
of
having
seduced
his
three
sisters
soldiers
who
had
made
a
campaign
in
profligate
greece
or
voluptuous
asia
naturally
brought
home
with
them
a
taste
for
the
pleasures
they
had
learned
to
enjoy
abroad
scipio
baths
were
dark
through
narrow
apertures
just
light
enough
was
admitted
to
spare
the
modesty
of
the
bathers
but
into
the
baths
which
were
erected
in
the
later
years
of
the
republic
the
light
shone
as
into
a
chamber
even
sylla
debauched
as
he
was
did
not
think
it
safe
to
abdicate
power
without
legislative
effort
to
purify
the
morals
he
had
so
largely
contributed
to
corrupt
by
his
example
of
the
augustan
age
and
the
two
or
three
centuries
which
followed
we
are
enabled
to
form
a
close
and
comprehensive
idea
our
information
ceases
to
be
meagre
on
some
points
indeed
it
is
only
too
abundant
the
object
of
the
julian
laws
was
to
preserve
the
roman
blood
from
corruption
and
still
farther
to
degrade
prostitutes
these
aims
were
partially
attained
by
prohibiting
the
intermarriage
of
citizens
with
the
relatives
or
descendants
of
prostitutes
by
exposing
adulterers
to
severe
penalties
and
declaring
the
tolerant
husband
an
accomplice
by
laying
penalties
on
bachelors
and
married
men
without
children
by
prohibiting
the
daughters
of
equestrians
from
becoming
prostitutes
tiberius
from
his
infamous
retreat
at
capreæ
sanctioned
a
decree
of
the
senate
which
enhanced
the
severity
of
the
laws
against
adultery
by
this
decree
it
was
made
a
penal
offense
for
a
matron
of
any
class
to
play
the
harlot
and
her
lover
the
owner
of
the
house
where
they
met
and
all
persons
who
connived
at
the
adultery
were
declared
equally
culpable
it
seems
to
have
been
not
uncommon
for
certain
married
women
to
inscribe
themselves
on
the
list
as
prostitutes
and
to
occupy
a
room
at
the
houses
of
ill
fame
this
was
pronounced
a
penal
offense
and
every
encouragement
was
held
out
both
to
husbands
and
to
common
informers
to
prosecute
in
other
respects
the
republican
legislation
is
believed
to
have
been
unaltered
by
the
emperors
the
formality
of
inscription
its
accompanying
infamy
the
consequences
of
the
act
remained
the
same
prostitutes
carried
on
their
trade
under
the
ædile
eye
he
patrolled
the
streets
and
entered
the
houses
of
ill
fame
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
he
saw
that
they
were
closed
between
daybreak
and
three
in
the
afternoon
in
case
of
brawls
he
arrested
and
punished
the
disturbers
of
the
peace
he
punished
by
fine
and
scourging
the
omission
of
a
to
inscribe
every
female
in
his
house
he
insisted
on
prostitutes
wearing
the
garments
prescribed
by
law
and
dyeing
their
hair
blue
or
yellow
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
break
into
a
house
without
being
habited
in
the
insignia
of
his
office
and
being
accompanied
by
his
lictors
when
the
ædile
hostilius
attempted
to
break
open
the
door
of
the
prostitute
mamilia
on
his
return
from
a
gay
dinner
the
latter
drove
him
off
with
stones
and
was
sustained
by
the
courts
the
ædile
was
bound
also
on
complaint
laid
by
a
prostitute
to
sentence
any
customer
of
hers
to
pay
the
sum
due
to
her
according
to
law
classes
of
prostitutes
it
was
the
duty
of
the
ædile
to
arrest
punish
and
drive
out
of
the
city
all
loose
prostitutes
who
were
not
inscribed
on
his
book
this
regulation
was
practically
a
dead
letter
at
no
time
in
the
history
of
the
empire
did
there
cease
to
be
a
large
and
class
of
prostitutes
who
were
not
recorded
they
were
distinguished
from
the
registered
prostitutes
by
the
name
of
they
paid
no
tax
to
the
state
while
their
registered
rivals
contributed
largely
to
the
municipal
treasury
and
if
they
ran
greater
risks
and
incurred
more
nominal
infamy
than
the
latter
they
more
frequently
contrived
to
rise
from
their
unhappy
condition
we
have
no
means
of
judging
of
the
number
of
prostitutes
exercising
their
calling
at
rome
capua
and
the
other
italian
cities
during
the
first
years
of
the
christian
era
during
trajan
reign
the
police
were
enabled
to
count
thousand
in
rome
alone
but
this
number
obviously
fell
short
of
the
truth
one
is
appalled
at
the
great
variety
of
classes
into
which
the
or
unregistered
prostitutes
were
divided
such
were
the
corresponding
to
the
or
french
whose
charms
enabled
them
to
exact
large
sums
from
their
visitors
the
who
belonged
to
respectable
families
and
took
to
evil
courses
through
lust
or
avarice
the
who
were
remarkable
for
their
beauty
of
form
and
disdained
the
use
of
clothing
the
or
who
haunted
the
groves
and
commons
and
were
distinguished
by
a
particular
cry
in
imitation
of
a
wolf
the
or
bakers
girls
who
sold
small
cakes
for
sacrifice
to
venus
and
priapus
in
the
form
of
the
male
and
female
organs
of
generation
the
whose
home
was
the
and
who
occasionally
officiated
as
mourners
at
funerals
the
at
inns
and
taverns
who
were
invariably
prostitutes
the
or
the
a
very
low
class
of
women
who
derived
the
name
from
a
cheap
and
unwholesome
beverage
drunk
in
the
lowest
holes
the
wretched
outcasts
whose
price
was
two
oboli
say
two
cents
the
country
girls
who
lurked
about
country
roads
the
who
were
thieves
as
well
as
prostitutes
the
seemingly
the
lowest
class
of
all
whose
fee
was
less
than
any
copper
coin
now
current
in
contradistinction
to
these
the
assumed
an
air
of
respectability
and
were
often
called
another
and
a
distinct
class
of
prostitutes
were
the
female
dancers
who
were
eagerly
sought
after
and
more
numerous
than
at
athens
they
were
ionians
lesbians
syrians
egyptians
nubians
negresses
indians
but
the
most
famous
were
spaniards
their
dances
were
of
the
same
character
as
those
of
the
greek
the
erotic
poets
of
rome
have
not
shrunk
from
celebrating
the
astonishing
depravity
of
their
performances
horace
faintly
deplored
the
progress
which
the
ionic
dances
were
making
even
among
the
roman
virgins
these
prostitutes
carried
on
their
calling
in
defiance
of
law
if
detected
they
were
liable
to
be
whipped
and
driven
out
of
the
city
but
as
their
customers
belonged
to
the
wealthier
classes
they
rarely
suffered
the
penalty
of
their
conduct
apart
again
from
all
these
was
the
large
class
of
persons
who
traded
in
prostitutes
the
proper
name
for
these
wretches
was
bawd
which
was
of
both
sexes
though
usually
represented
on
the
stage
as
a
beardless
man
with
shaven
head
under
this
name
quite
a
number
of
varieties
were
included
such
as
the
or
keepers
of
regular
houses
of
ill
fame
the
and
pimps
and
women
who
negotiated
immoral
transactions
and
others
then
as
almost
every
baker
barber
and
perfumer
combined
the
or
trade
in
prostitutes
with
his
other
calling
their
various
names
became
synonymous
with
this
miserable
class
was
regarded
with
the
greatest
loathing
at
rome
this
hasty
classification
of
the
roman
prostitutes
would
be
incomplete
without
some
notice
however
brief
of
male
prostitutes
fortunately
the
progress
of
good
morals
has
divested
this
repulsive
theme
of
its
importance
the
object
of
this
work
can
be
obtained
without
entering
into
details
on
a
branch
of
the
subject
which
in
this
country
is
not
likely
to
require
fresh
legislative
notice
but
the
reader
would
form
an
imperfect
idea
of
the
state
of
morals
at
rome
were
he
left
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
the
number
of
male
prostitutes
was
probably
full
as
large
as
that
of
females
that
as
in
greece
the
degrading
phenomenon
involved
very
little
disgrace
that
all
the
roman
authors
allude
to
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
leading
men
of
the
empire
were
known
to
be
addicted
to
such
habits
that
the
ædile
abstained
from
interference
save
where
a
roman
youth
suffered
violence
and
that
to
judge
from
the
language
of
the
writers
of
the
first
second
and
third
centuries
of
the
christian
era
the
romans
like
some
asiatic
races
appeared
to
give
the
preference
to
unnatural
lusts
houses
of
prostitution
having
examined
the
laws
which
governed
prostitution
at
rome
and
the
classes
into
which
prostitutes
were
divided
it
is
now
requisite
to
glance
at
the
establishments
in
which
prostitution
was
carried
on
dufour
and
others
have
followed
publius
victor
and
sextus
rufus
in
supposing
that
during
the
augustine
age
there
were
houses
of
ill
fame
at
rome
and
a
much
larger
number
of
establishments
where
prostitution
was
carried
on
without
the
supervision
of
the
ædile
as
it
is
now
generally
admitted
that
the
works
bearing
the
name
of
publius
victor
and
sextus
rufus
are
forgeries
of
comparatively
recent
date
the
statement
loses
all
claim
to
credit
and
we
are
left
without
statistical
information
as
to
the
number
of
houses
of
prostitution
at
rome
registered
prostitutes
were
to
be
found
in
the
establishments
called
lupanaria
these
differed
from
the
greek
dicteria
in
being
of
various
classes
from
the
house
of
the
peace
ward
to
the
filthy
dens
of
the
esquiline
and
suburran
wards
and
farther
in
the
wide
range
of
prices
exacted
by
the
keepers
of
the
various
houses
it
is
inferred
from
the
results
of
the
excavations
at
pompeii
and
some
meagre
hints
thrown
out
by
latin
authors
that
the
lupanaria
at
rome
were
small
in
size
the
most
prosperous
were
built
like
good
roman
houses
with
a
square
sometimes
with
a
fountain
playing
in
the
middle
upon
this
yard
opened
the
cells
of
the
prostitutes
in
smaller
establishments
the
cells
opened
upon
a
hall
or
porch
which
seemingly
was
used
as
a
the
cells
were
dark
closets
illuminated
at
night
by
a
small
bronze
lamp
sometimes
they
contained
a
bed
but
as
often
a
few
cushions
or
a
mere
mat
with
a
dirty
counterpane
constituted
their
whole
furniture
over
the
door
of
each
cell
hung
a
tablet
with
the
name
of
the
prostitute
who
occupied
it
and
the
price
she
set
on
her
favors
on
the
other
side
with
the
word
when
a
prostitute
received
a
visitor
in
her
cell
she
turned
the
tablet
round
to
warn
intruders
that
she
was
engaged
over
the
door
of
the
house
a
suggestive
image
was
either
painted
or
represented
in
stone
or
marble
one
of
these
signs
may
be
seen
to
this
day
in
pompeii
within
similar
indecent
sculptures
abounded
bronze
ornaments
of
this
style
hung
round
the
necks
of
the
courtesans
the
lamps
were
in
the
same
shape
and
so
were
a
variety
of
other
utensils
the
walls
were
covered
with
appropriate
frescoes
in
the
establishments
it
is
understood
that
scenes
from
the
mythology
were
the
usual
subjects
of
these
artistic
decorations
but
we
have
evidence
enough
at
pompeii
to
show
that
gross
indecency
not
poetical
effect
was
the
main
object
sought
by
painters
in
these
works
regular
houses
of
prostitution
were
of
two
kinds
establishments
owned
and
managed
by
a
bawd
who
supplied
the
cells
with
slaves
or
hired
prostitutes
and
establishments
where
the
bawd
merely
let
his
cells
to
prostitutes
for
a
given
sum
in
the
former
case
the
bawd
was
the
principal
in
the
latter
the
women
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
the
former
were
the
more
respectable
petronius
alludes
to
a
house
where
so
much
was
paid
for
the
use
of
a
cell
and
the
sum
was
an
less
than
two
cents
messalina
evidently
betook
herself
to
one
of
these
establishments
which
for
clearness
sake
we
may
call
assignation
houses
and
as
it
appears
she
was
paid
in
copper
it
is
safe
to
infer
that
the
house
was
of
slender
respectability
the
best
houses
were
abundantly
supplied
with
servants
and
luxuries
a
swarm
of
pimps
and
runners
sought
custom
for
them
in
every
part
of
the
city
women
were
in
readiness
to
repair
with
skill
the
ravages
which
amorous
conflicts
caused
in
the
toilets
of
the
prostitutes
boys
attended
at
the
door
of
the
cell
with
water
for
ablution
servants
who
bore
the
inconsistent
title
of
were
ready
to
supply
wine
and
other
refreshments
to
customers
and
not
a
few
of
the
lupinaria
kept
a
cashier
called
whose
business
it
was
to
discuss
bargains
with
visitors
and
to
receive
the
money
before
turning
the
tablet
under
many
public
and
some
of
the
best
private
houses
at
rome
were
arches
the
tops
of
which
were
only
a
few
feet
above
the
level
of
the
street
these
arches
dark
and
deserted
became
a
refuge
for
prostitutes
their
name
at
last
became
synonymous
with
and
we
have
borrowed
from
it
our
generic
word
fornication
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
there
were
several
score
of
arches
of
this
character
and
used
for
this
purpose
under
the
great
circus
and
other
theatres
at
rome
besides
those
under
and
stores
the
want
of
fresh
air
was
severely
felt
in
these
vile
abodes
frequent
allusions
to
the
stench
exhaled
from
the
mouth
of
a
fornix
are
made
in
the
roman
authors
establishments
of
a
lower
character
still
were
the
in
which
the
girls
occupied
a
balcony
above
the
street
the
where
no
cells
were
used
and
promiscuous
intercourse
took
place
openly
the
or
the
or
suburb
houses
of
the
very
lowest
stamp
the
clearest
picture
of
a
roman
house
of
ill
fame
is
that
given
in
the
famous
passage
of
juvenal
which
may
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
original

hardly
be
added

the
passages
in
italics
contain
useful
information
we
shall
allude
to
some
of
them
hereafter
meanwhile
it
is
evident
from
the
line
that
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
night
the
keepers
of
houses
of
ill
fame
were
in
the
habit
of
closing
their
establishments
and
sending
their
girls
home
the
law
required
them
to
close
at
daybreak
but
probably
a
much
earlier
hour
may
have
suited
their
interest
allusion
has
already
been
made
to
the
fornices
under
the
circus
it
is
well
understood
that
prostitutes
were
great
frequenters
of
the
spectacles
and
that
in
the
arched
fornices
underneath
the
seats
and
the
stage
they
were
always
ready
to
satisfy
the
passions
which
the
comedies
and
pantomimes
only
too
frequently
aroused
this
was
one
formidable
rival
to
the
regular
lupinaria
the
baths
were
another
in
the
early
roman
baths
darkness
or
at
best
a
faint
twilight
reigned
and
besides
not
only
were
the
sexes
separated
but
old
and
young
men
were
not
allowed
to
bathe
together
but
after
sylla
wars
though
there
were
separate
and
for
the
sexes
they
could
meet
freely
in
the
corridors
and
chambers
and
any
immorality
short
of
actual
prostitution
could
take
place
men
and
women
girls
and
boys
mixed
together
in
a
state
of
perfect
nudity
and
in
such
close
proximity
that
contact
could
hardly
be
avoided
such
an
assemblage
would
obviously
be
a
place
of
resort
for
dealers
in
prostitutes
in
search
of
merchandise
at
a
later
period
cells
were
attached
to
the
and
young
men
and
women
kept
on
the
premises
partly
as
bath
attendants
and
partly
as
prostitutes
after
the
bath
the
bathers
male
and
female
were
rubbed
down
kneaded
and
anointed
by
these
attendants
it
would
appear
that
women
submitted
to
have
this
indecent
service
performed
for
them
by
men
and
that
health
was
not
always
the
object
sought
even
by
the
roman
matrons
several
emperors
endeavored
to
remedy
these
frightful
immoralities
hadrian
forbade
the
intermixture
of
men
and
women
in
the
public
baths
similar
enactments
were
made
by
marcus
aurelius
and
alexander
severus
but
heliogabalus
is
said
to
have
delighted
in
uniting
the
sexes
even
in
the
as
early
as
the
augustan
era
however
the
baths
were
regarded
as
little
better
than
houses
of
prostitution
under
a
respectable
name
taverns
or
houses
of
entertainment
were
also
in
some
measure
brothels
the
law
regarded
all
servants
waiting
upon
travelers
at
inns
or
taverns
as
prostitutes
it
would
appear
also
that
butchers
bakers
and
barbers
shops
were
open
to
a
suspicion
of
being
used
for
purposes
of
prostitution
the
plebeian
ædiles
constantly
made
it
their
business
to
visit
these
in
search
of
unregistered
prostitutes
though
as
might
be
expected
from
the
number
of
delinquents
and
the
very
incomplete
municipal
police
system
of
rome
with
very
little
success
the
establishments
which
generally
included
a
were
haunted
by
a
low
class
of
prostitutes
to
whom
allusion
has
already
been
made
in
the
cellar
where
the
mill
stood
cells
were
often
constructed
and
the
ædiles
knew
well
that
all
who
entered
there
did
not
go
to
buy
bread
finally
prostitution
to
a
very
large
extent
was
carried
on
in
the
open
air
the
shades
of
certain
statues
and
temples
such
as
those
of
marsyas
pan
priapus
venus
were
common
resorts
for
prostitutes
it
is
said
that
julia
the
daughter
of
the
emperor
augustus
prostituted
herself
under
the
shade
of
a
statue
of
marsyas
similar
haunts
of
abandoned
women
were
the
arches
of
aqueducts
the
porticoes
of
temples
the
cavities
in
walls
etc
even
the
streets
in
the
poorer
wards
of
the
city
appear
to
have
been
infested
by
the
very
lowest
class
of
prostitutes
whose
natural
favors
had
long
ceased
to
be
merchantable
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
streets
of
rome
were
not
lighted
and
that
profound
darkness
reigned
when
the
moon
was
clouded
over
habits
and
manners
of
prostitutes
a
grand
distinction
between
roman
and
greek
prostitution
lies
in
the
manner
in
which
commerce
with
prostitutes
was
viewed
in
the
two
communities
at
athens
there
was
nothing
disgraceful
in
frequenting
the
dicterion
or
keeping
an
hetaira
at
rome
on
the
contrary
a
married
man
who
visited
a
house
of
ill
fame
was
an
and
liable
to
the
penalties
of
adultery
an
habitual
frequenter
of
such
places
was
a
or
both
of
which
were
terms
of
scathing
reproach
when
cicero
wishes
to
overwhelm
catiline
he
says
his
followers
are
until
the
lowest
age
of
roman
degradation
moreover
no
man
of
any
character
entered
a
house
of
ill
fame
without
hiding
his
face
with
the
skirt
of
his
dress
even
caligula
and
heliogabalus
concealed
their
faces
when
they
visited
the
women
of
the
town
the
law
prescribed
with
care
the
dress
of
roman
prostitutes
on
the
principle
that
they
were
to
be
distinguished
in
all
things
from
honest
women
thus
they
were
not
allowed
to
wear
the
chaste
which
concealed
the
form
or
the
or
fillet
with
which
roman
ladies
bound
their
hair
or
to
wear
shoes
or
jewels
or
purple
robes
these
were
the
insignia
of
virtue
prostitutes
wore
the
like
men
their
hair
dyed
yellow
or
red
or
filled
with
golden
spangles
was
dressed
in
some
asiatic
fashion
they
wore
sandals
with
gilt
thongs
tying
over
the
instep
and
their
dress
was
directed
to
be
of
flowered
material
in
practice
however
these
rules
were
not
strictly
observed
courtesans
wore
jewels
and
purple
robes
and
not
a
few
boldly
concealed
their
profligacy
under
the
others
seeking
rather
to
avoid
than
to
court
misapprehension
as
to
their
calling
wore
the
green
toga
proudly
and
over
it
the
sort
of
jacket
called
which
like
the
white
sheet
of
baronial
times
was
the
badge
of
adultery
others
again
preferred
the
silk
and
gauze
dresses
of
the
east
which
according
to
the
expression
of
a
classical
writer
seemed
invented
to
exhibit
more
conspicuously
what
they
were
intended
to
hide
robes
of
tyre
were
likewise
in
use
whose
texture
may
be
inferred
from
the
name
of
textile
vapor
which
they
received
the
law
strictly
prohibited
the
use
of
vehicles
of
any
kind
to
courtesans
this
also
was
frequently
infringed
under
several
emperors
prostitutes
were
seen
in
open
litters
in
the
most
public
parts
of
rome
and
others
in
litters
which
closed
with
curtains
and
served
the
purpose
of
a
a
law
of
domitian
imposed
heavy
penalties
on
a
courtesan
who
was
seen
in
a
litter
in
the
lupanar
of
course
rules
regarding
costume
were
unheeded
prostitutes
retained
their
hair
black
but
as
to
the
rest
of
their
person
they
were
governed
by
their
own
taste
nudity
appears
to
have
been
quite
common
if
not
the
rule
petronius
describes
his
hero
walking
in
the
street
and
seeing
from
thence
naked
prostitutes
at
the
doors
of
the
lupanaria
some
covered
their
busts
with
golden
stuffs
others
veiled
their
faces
it
has
already
been
mentioned
that
the
rate
of
remuneration
exacted
by
the
prostitutes
was
fixed
by
themselves
though
apparently
announced
to
the
ædile
it
is
impossible
to
form
any
idea
of
the
average
amount
of
this
charge
the
lowest
classes
as
has
been
mentioned
sold
their
miserable
favors
for
about
two
tenths
of
a
cent
another
large
class
were
satisfied
with
two
cents
the
only
direct
light
that
is
thrown
on
this
branch
of
the
subject
flows
from
an
obscure
passage
in
the
strange
romance
entitled
apollonius
of
tyre
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
written
by
a
christian
named
symposius
in
that
work
the
capture
of
a
virgin
named
tarsia
by
a
bawd
is
described
the
bawd
orders
a
sign
or
advertisement
to
be
hung
out
inscribed
he
who
deflours
tarsia
shall
pay
half
a
pound
afterward
she
shall
be
at
the
public
service
for
a
gold
piece
the
half
pound
has
been
assumed
by
commentators
to
mean
half
a
roman
pound
of
silver
and
to
have
been
worth
the
gold
piece
according
to
the
best
computation
was
about
equivalent
to
but
whether
these
figures
can
be
regarded
as
an
average
admits
of
doubt
even
supposing
our
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
sums
mentioned
in
the
ancient
work
to
be
accurate
the
allusion
to
tarsia
suggests
some
notice
of
the
practice
of
the
roman
bawds
when
they
had
secured
a
virgin
it
will
be
found
faithfully
described
in
that
old
english
play
pericles
prince
of
tyre
which
is
sometimes
bound
up
with
shakspeare
works
when
a
bawd
had
purchased
a
virgin
as
a
slave
or
when
as
sometimes
happened
under
the
later
emperors
a
virgin
was
handed
to
him
to
be
prostituted
as
a
punishment
for
crime
the
door
of
his
house
was
adorned
with
twigs
of
laurel
a
lamp
of
unusual
size
was
hung
out
at
night
and
a
tablet
exhibited
somewhat
similar
to
the
one
quoted
above
stating
that
a
virgin
had
been
received
and
enumerating
her
charms
with
cruel
grossness
when
a
purchaser
had
been
found
and
a
bargain
struck
the
unfortunate
girl
often
a
mere
child
was
surrendered
to
his
brutality
and
the
wretch
issued
from
the
cell
afterward
to
be
himself
crowned
with
laurel
by
the
slaves
of
the
establishment
thus
far
of
common
prostitutes
though
the
romans
had
no
loose
women
who
could
compare
in
point
of
standing
influence
or
intellect
with
the
greek
hetairæ
their
highest
class
of
prostitutes
the
or
were
very
far
above
the
unfortunate
creatures
just
described
they
were
not
inscribed
in
the
ædile
rolls
they
haunted
no
lupanar
or
tavern
or
baker
stall
they
were
not
seen
lurking
about
shady
spots
at
night
they
wore
no
distinguishing
costume
it
was
in
broad
daylight
at
the
theatre
in
the
streets
in
the
via
sacra
which
was
the
favorite
resort
of
fashionable
rome
that
they
were
to
be
found
and
there
they
were
only
to
be
distinguished
from
virtuous
matrons
by
the
superior
elegance
of
their
dress
and
the
swarm
of
admirers
by
whom
they
were
surrounded
indeed
under
the
later
emperors
the
distinction
outward
or
inward
between
these
prostitutes
and
the
roman
matrons
appears
to
have
been
very
slight
indeed
they
were
surrounded
or
followed
by
slaves
of
either
sex
a
favorite
being
the
most
usual
attendant
their
meaning
glances
are
frequently
the
subject
of
caustic
allusions
in
the
roman
poets
many
of
them
were
foreigners
and
expressed
themselves
by
signs
from
ignorance
of
the
latin
tongue
these
women
were
usually
the
mistresses
of
rich
men
though
not
necessarily
faithful
to
their
lovers
we
possess
no
such
biographies
of
them
as
we
have
of
the
greek
hetairæ
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
suppose
that
their
lives
ever
formed
the
theme
of
serious
works
though
the
roman
erotic
library
was
rich
what
little
we
know
of
them
we
glean
mostly
from
the
verses
of
horace
tibullus
ovid
propertius
catullus
martial
and
from
such
works
as
the
satyricon
of
petronius
and
the
novel
of
apuleius
and
that
little
is
hardly
worth
the
knowing
the
first
five
poets
mentioned
catullus
horace
propertius
ovid
and
tibullus
devoted
no
small
portion
of
their
time
and
talent
to
the
celebration
of
their
mistresses
but
beyond
their
names
lydia
chloe
lalage
lesbia
cynthia
delia
neæra
corinna
we
are
taught
nothing
about
them
but
what
might
have
been
taken
for
granted
that
they
were
occasionally
beautiful
lascivious
extravagant
often
faithless
and
heartless
from
passages
in
ovid
and
also
in
one
or
two
of
the
others
it
may
be
inferred
that
it
was
not
uncommon
for
these
great
prostitutes
to
have
a
nominal
husband
who
undertook
the
duty
of
negotiating
their
immoral
bargains
the
only
really
useful
information
we
derive
from
these
erotic
effusions
relates
to
the
poets
themselves
all
the
five
we
have
mentioned
moved
in
the
best
society
at
rome
some
of
them
like
horace
saw
their
fame
culminate
during
their
lifetime
others
filled
important
stations
under
government
ovid
was
intimate
with
the
emperor
augustus
and
his
exile
is
supposed
to
have
been
caused
by
some
improper
discoveries
he
made
with
regard
to
the
emperor
relations
with
his
daughter
yet
it
is
quite
evident
that
all
these
persons
habitually
lived
with
prostitutes
felt
no
shame
on
that
account
and
recorded
unblushingly
the
charms
and
exploits
of
their
mistresses
in
verses
intended
to
be
read
indiscriminately
by
the
roman
youths
between
ovid
and
martial
the
distance
is
immense
half
a
century
divided
them
in
point
of
time
whole
ages
in
tone
during
the
augustan
era
the
language
of
poets
though
much
freer
than
would
be
tolerated
was
not
invariably
coarse
no
gross
expressions
are
used
by
the
poets
of
that
day
in
addressing
their
mistresses
and
even
common
prostitutes
are
addressed
with
epithets
which
a
modern
lover
might
apply
to
his
betrothed
but
martial
knows
no
decency
it
may
safely
be
said
that
his
epigrams
ought
never
again
to
be
translated
into
a
modern
tongue
expressions
designating
the
most
loathsome
depravities
and
which
happily
have
no
equivalent
and
need
none
in
our
language
abound
in
his
pages
pictures
of
the
most
revolting
pruriency
succeed
each
other
rapidly
in
a
word
such
language
is
used
and
such
scenes
depicted
as
would
involve
the
expulsion
of
their
utterer
from
any
house
of
ill
fame
in
modern
times
yet
martial
enjoyed
high
favor
under
government
he
was
enabled
to
procure
the
naturalization
of
many
of
his
spanish
friends
he
possessed
a
country
and
a
town
house
both
probably
gifts
from
the
emperor
his
works
even
in
his
lifetime
were
carefully
sought
after
not
only
in
rome
but
in
gaul
spain
and
the
other
provinces
upon
the
character
and
life
of
courtesans
in
his
day
he
throws
but
little
light
the
women
whose
hideous
depravity
he
celebrates
must
have
been
well
known
at
rome
their
names
must
have
been
familiar
to
the
ears
of
roman
society
but
this
feature
of
roman
civilization
the
notoriety
of
prostitutes
and
of
their
vile
arts
properly
belongs
to
another
division
of
the
subject
roman
society
it
was
often
said
by
the
ancients
that
the
more
prostitutes
there
were
the
safer
would
be
virtuous
women
well
done
said
the
moralist
to
a
youth
entering
a
house
of
ill
fame
so
shalt
thou
spare
matrons
and
maidens
as
this
idea
rests
upon
a
slender
substratum
of
plausibility
it
may
be
as
well
to
expose
its
fallacy
which
can
be
done
very
completely
by
a
glance
at
roman
society
under
the
emperors
even
allowing
for
poetical
exaggeration
it
may
safely
be
said
that
there
is
no
modern
society
perhaps
there
has
never
existed
any
since
the
fall
of
rome
to
which
juvenal
famous
satire
on
women
can
be
applied
independently
of
the
unnatural
lusts
which
were
so
unblushingly
avowed
the
picture
drawn
by
the
roman
surpasses
modern
credibility
that
it
was
faithful
to
nature
and
fact
there
is
unhappily
too
much
reason
to
believe
the
causes
must
be
sought
in
various
directions
two
marked
distinctions
between
modern
and
ancient
society
may
at
once
be
noticed
in
no
modern
civilized
society
is
it
allowable
to
present
immodest
images
to
the
eye
or
to
utter
immodest
words
in
the
ear
of
females
or
youth
at
rome
the
contrary
was
the
rule
the
walls
of
respectable
houses
were
covered
with
paintings
of
which
one
hardly
dares
in
our
times
to
mention
the
subjects
lascivious
frescoes
and
lewd
sculptures
such
as
would
be
seized
in
any
modern
country
by
the
police
filled
the
halls
of
the
most
virtuous
roman
citizens
and
nobles
ingenuity
had
been
taxed
to
the
utmost
to
reproduce
certain
indecent
objects
under
new
forms
nor
was
common
indecency
adequate
to
supply
the
depraved
taste
of
the
romans
such
groups
as
satyrs
and
nymphs
leda
and
the
swan
pasiphæ
and
the
bull
satyrs
and
were
abundant
some
of
them
have
been
found
and
exhibit
a
wonderful
artistic
skill
all
of
these
were
daily
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
children
and
young
girls
who
as
propertius
says
were
not
allowed
to
remain
novices
in
any
infamy
again
though
a
horace
would
use
polite
expressions
in
addressing
tyndaris
or
lalage
the
latin
tongue
was
much
freer
than
any
modern
one
there
is
not
a
latin
author
of
the
best
age
in
whose
writings
the
coarsest
words
can
not
be
found
the
comedies
were
frightfully
obscene
both
in
ideas
and
expressions
a
youth
or
a
maiden
could
not
begin
to
acquire
instruction
without
meeting
words
of
the
grossest
meaning
the
convenient
adage
non
was
invented
to
hide
the
pruriency
of
authors
and
one
of
the
worst
puts
in
the
wretched
plea
that
though
his
page
is
lewd
his
life
is
pure
it
is
quite
certain
that
whatever
might
have
been
the
effect
on
the
poet
his
readers
could
not
but
be
demoralized
by
the
lewdness
of
his
verses
add
to
these
causes
of
immorality
the
baths
and
a
fair
case
in
support
of
juvenal
will
be
already
made
out
a
young
roman
girl
with
warm
southern
blood
in
her
veins
who
could
gaze
on
the
unveiled
pictures
of
the
loves
of
venus
read
the
shameful
epigrams
of
martial
or
the
burning
of
catullus
go
to
the
baths
and
see
the
nudity
of
scores
of
men
and
women
be
touched
herself
by
a
hundred
lewd
hands
as
well
as
those
of
the
bathers
who
rubbed
her
dry
and
kneaded
her
limbs
a
young
girl
who
could
withstand
such
experiences
and
remain
virtuous
would
need
indeed
to
be
a
miracle
of
principle
and
strength
of
mind
but
even
then
religion
and
law
remained
to
assail
her
she
could
not
walk
through
the
streets
of
rome
without
seeing
temples
raised
to
the
honor
of
venus
that
venus
who
was
the
mother
of
rome
as
the
patroness
of
illicit
pleasures
in
every
field
and
in
many
a
square
statues
of
priapus
whose
enormous
indecency
was
his
chief
characteristic
presented
themselves
to
view
often
surrounded
by
pious
matrons
in
quest
of
favor
from
the
god
once
a
year
at
the
lupercalia
she
saw
young
men
running
naked
through
the
streets
armed
with
thongs
with
which
they
struck
every
woman
they
saw
and
she
noticed
that
matrons
courted
this
flagellation
as
a
means
of
becoming
prolific
what
she
may
have
known
of
the
dionysia
or
saturnalia
the
wild
games
in
honor
of
bacchus
and
of
those
other
dissolute
festivals
known
as
the
eves
of
venus
which
were
kept
in
april
it
is
not
easy
to
say
but
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
these
lewd
scenes
were
intended
only
for
the
vicious
or
that
they
were
kept
a
secret
when
her
marriage
approached
the
remains
of
her
modesty
were
effectually
destroyed
before
marriage
she
was
led
to
the
statue
of
mutinus
a
nude
sitting
figure
and
made
to
sit
on
his
knee
ejus
pudicitiam

deus
delibasse
this
usage
was
so
deeply
rooted
among
the
romans
that
when
augustus
destroyed
the
temple
of
mutinus
in
the
velian
ward
in
consequence
of
the
immoralities
to
which
it
gave
rise
a
dozen
others

rose
to
take
its
place
on
the

statuettes
of

deities
and
hung
over
the
nuptial
bed
subacta

sponso
viro

se
commoveat
quum
and
in
the
morning
the
jealous
husband
exacted
by
measuring
the
neck
of
his
bride
proof
to
his
superstitious
mind
that
she
had
yielded
him
her
virginity
in
the
older
age
of
the
republic
it
was
not
considered
decent
for
women
to
recline
on
couches
at
table
as
men
did
this
however
soon
became
quite
common
men
and
women
lay
together
on
the
same
couch
so
close
that
hardly
room
for
eating
was
left
and
this
was
the
custom
not
only
with
women
of
loose
morals
but
with
the
most
respectable
matrons
at
the
feast
of
trimalchio
which
is
the
best
recital
of
a
roman
dinner
we
have
the
wife
of
the
host
and
the
wife
of
habinus
both
appeared
before
the
guests
habinus
amused
them
by
seizing
his
host
wife
by
the
feet
and
throwing
her
forward
so
that
her
dress
flew
up
and
exposed
her
knees
and
trimalchio
himself
did
not
blush
to
show
his
preference
for
a
giton
in
the
presence
of
the
company
and
to
throw
a
cup
at
his
wife
head
when
her
jealousy
led
her
to
remonstrate
the
voyage
of
the
hero
of
the
satyricon
furnishes
other
pictures
of
the
intensely
depraved
feeling
which
pervaded
roman
society
the
author
does
not
seem
to
admit
the
possibility
of
virtue
existence
all
his
men
and
women
are
equally
vicious
and
shameless
the
open
spectacle
of
the
most
hideous
debauchery
only
provokes
a
laugh
if
a
man
declines
to
accede
to
the
propositions
which
the
women
are
the
first
to
make
it
must
be
because
he
is
a
disciple
of
the
and
whole
cities
are
depicted
as
joining
in
the
hue
and
cry
after
the
lost
of
a
noted
debauchee
the
which
cicero
enumerates
among
the
symptoms
of
corruption
in
his
time
had
become
of
universal
usage
it
was
for
them
that
the
cooks
of
rome
exhausted
their
art
in
devising
the
dishes
which
have
puzzled
modern
gastronomists
for
them
that
the
rare
old
wines
of
italy
were
stowed
away
in
cellars
for
them

perhaps
difficult
to

he
founded
on
the

of

with

were

sketch
of
his
journeys
given
by

the
allusions
to
his

that

was
his
pride
to
have

most

of

something
more
than
they
knew
his
pleasure
to
wallow
among

naked
and
to
pull
down
into
the
sink
of
bestiality
in
which
he
lived
the
first
officers
of
the
empire
when
such
was
the
example
set
by
men
in
high
places
there
is
no
need
of
inquiring
farther
into
the
condition
of
the
public
morals
a
censor
like
tacitus
might
indignantly
reprove
but
a
martial
and
he
was
no
doubt
a
better
exponent
of
public
and
social
life
than
the
stern
historian
would
only
laugh
and
copy
the
model
before
him
it
may
safely
be
asserted
that
there
does
not
exist
in
any
modern
language
a
piece
of
writing
which
indicates
so
hopelessly
depraved
a
state
of
morals
as
martial
epigram
on
his
wife
secret
diseases
at
rome
at
what
period
and
where
venereal
diseases
first
made
their
appearance
is
a
matter
of
doubt
it
was
long
the
opinion
of
the
faculty
that
they
were
of
modern
origin
and
that
europe
had
derived
them
from
america
where
the
sailors
of
columbus
had
first
contracted
them
this
opinion
does
not
appear
to
rest
on
any
solid
basis
and
is
now
generally
rejected
the
fact
is
that
the
venereal
disease
prevailed
extensively
in
europe
in
the
fifteenth
century
but
the
presumption
from
an
imposing
mass
of
circumstantial
evidence
is
that
it
has
afflicted
humanity
from
the
beginning
of
history
still
it
is
strange
that
greek
and
latin
authors
do
not
mention
it
there
is
a
passage
in
juvenal
in
which
allusion
is
made
to
a
disgusting
disease
which
appears
to
bear
resemblance
to
venereal
disease
epigrams
of
martial
hint
at
something
of
the
same
kind
celsus
describes
several
diseases
of
the
generative
organs
but
none
of
these
authors
ascribe
the
diseases
they
mention
to
venereal
intercourse
celsus
prefaces
what
he
says
on
the
subject
of
this
class
of
maladies
with
an
apology
nothing
but
a
sense
of
duty
has
led
him
to
allude
to
matters
so
delicate
but
he
feels
that
he
ought
not
to
allow
his
country
to
lose
the
benefit
of
his
experience
and
he
conceives
it
to
be
desirable
to
disseminate
among
the
people
some
medical
principles
with
regard
to
a
class
of
diseases
which
are
never
revealed
to
any
one
after
this
apology
he
proceeds
to
speak
of
a
disease
which
he
calls
which
seems
to
have
borne
a
striking
analogy
to
the
modern
it
has
been
supposed
that
the
which
he
describes
at
length
was
also
of
a
syphilitic
character
and
the
symptoms
detailed
by
aretous
who
wrote
in
the
latter
half
of
the
first
century
certainly
remind
the
reader
of
secondary
syphilis
but
the
best
opinion
of
appears
to
be
that
the
diseases
are
distinct
and
unconnected
women
afflicted
with
secret
diseases
were
called
which
explains
itself
they
prayed
to
juno
fluonia
for
relief
and
used
the
by
way
of
medicine
the
greek
term
for
this
herb
being
which
the
romans
converted
into
that
word
came
to
be
applied
to
the
disease
for
which
it
was
given
whether
in
the
case
of
females
or
males
modern
science
has
obtained
thence
the
term
bubo
the
romans
said
of
a
female
who
communicated
a
disease
to
a
man
te
we
find
moreover
in
the
later
writers
allusions
to
the
the
the
which
were
all
secret
diseases
of
a
type
if
not
syphilitic
strongly
resembling
it
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
no
passage
in
the
ancient
writers
directly
ascribes
these
diseases
to
commerce
with
prostitutes
roman
doctors
declined
to
treat
secret
diseases
they
were
called
by
the
generic
term
and
it
was
considered
unbecoming
to
confess
to
them
or
to
treat
them
rich
men
owned
a
slave
doctor
who
was
in
the
confidence
of
the
family
and
to
whom
such
delicate
secrets
would
naturally
be
confided
but
the
mass
of
the
people
were
restrained
by
shame
from
communicating
their
misfortunes
as
was
the
case
among
the
jews
the
unhappy
patient
was
driven
to
seclusion
as
the
only
remedy
however
cruel
and
senseless
this
practice
may
have
been
as
regarded
the
sufferer
it
was
of
service
to
the
people
as
it
prevented
in
some
degree
the
spread
of
contagion
up
to
the
period
of
the
civil
wars
and
perhaps
as
late
as
the
christian
era
the
only
physicians
at
rome
were
enchanters
and
midwives
the
standing
of
the
former
may
be
inferred
from
a
passage
in
horace
where
he
classes
them
with
the
lowest
outcasts
of
roman
society
the
enchanters
made
philtres
to
produce
or
impede
the
sensual
appetite
they
were
execrated
and
even
so
amorous
a
poet
as
ovid
felt
bound
to
warn
young
girls
against
the
evil
effects
of
the
aphrodisiacs
they
concocted
midwives
also
made
philtres
and
are
often
confounded
with
the
the
healing
science
of
the
three
classes

have
been
small

of
augustus
greek
physicians
began
to
settle
at
rome
they
possessed
much
theory
and
some
practical
experience
as
the
treatise
of
celsus
shows
and
soon
became
an
important
class
in
roman
society
it
was
not
however
till
the
reign
of
nero
that
an
office
of
public
physician
was
created
under
that
emperor
a
greek
named
andromachus
was
appointed
or
court
physician
and
were
soon
afterward
appointed
for
the
people
they
were
allowed
to
receive
money
from
the
rich
but
they
were
bound
in
consideration
of
various
privileges
bestowed
on
their
office
to
treat
the
poor
gratuitously
they
were
stationed
in
every
city
in
the
empire
rome
had
fourteen
besides
those
attached
to
the
vestals
the
gymnasia
and
the
court
other
large
cities
had
ten
and
so
on
down
to
the
small
towns
which
had
one
or
two
from
the
duties
and
privileges
of
the
it
would
appear
they
were
subject
to
the
ædiles
it
may
seem
almost
superfluous
to
add
that
no
careful
medical
reader
of
the
history
of
rome
under
the
empire
can
doubt
but
the
archiatii
filled
no
sinecure
and
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
diseases
they
treated
were
directly
traceable
to
prostitution

perhaps
the
most
marked
originality
of

was
the
stress
it
laid
on
chastity
it
has
been
well
remarked
that
even
the
most
austere
of
the
pagan
moralists
recommended
chastity
on
grounds
alone
the
apostles
exacted
it
as
a
moral
and

duty

preached

as
fervently
as
against

inveighs
in

nor
can
it
be
doubted
that
under
divine
providence
the
obvious
merit
of
this
feature

exercised
a
large
influence
in

a
just
boast
of
the
purity
of
their
morals
their
adversaries
met
them
on
this
ground
at
great
disadvantage
it
was
notorious
that
the
college
of
vestals
had
been
sustained
with
great
difficulty
latterly
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
supply
vacancies
with
children
and
even
under
these
circumstances
the
number
of
vestals
buried
alive
bore
but
a
very
small
proportion
to
the
number
who
had
incurred
this
dread
penalty
nor
could
it
be
denied
that
the
chastity
of
the
roman
virgins
was
at
best
but
partial
the
purest
among
them
being
accustomed
to
unchaste
language
and
unchaste
sights
the
christian
congregations
on
the
contrary
contained
numbers
of
virgins
who
had
devoted
themselves
to
celibacy

the
love
of

they
were
modest

holy
institution
whose
sole
end
was
the
procreation
of
children
it
was
not
to
be
used
as
was
the
case
too
often
among
the
heathen
as
a
cloak
for
immoralities
christ
they
said
permitted
marriage
but
did
not
permit
luxury
the
early
fathers
imposed
severe
penitences
on
fornication
adultery
and
other
varieties
of
sensuality
persecution
aided
the
church
in
the
great
work
of
purifying
public
morals
by
forcing
it
to
keep
in
view
the
christian
distinction
between
moral
and
physical
guilt
at
what
time
it
became
usual
to
condemn
christian
virgins
to
the
brothel
it
is
difficult
to
discover
the
practice
may
have
arisen
from
the
hideous
custom
which
enjoined
the
violation
of
roman
maidens
before
execution
if
the
existence
of
such
a
custom
can
be
assumed
on
the
authority
of
so
loose
a
chronicler
as
suetonius
however
this
be
this
horrible
refinement
of
brutality
was
in
use
in
the
time
of
marcus
aurelius
virgins
were
seized
and
required
to
sacrifice
to
idols
refusing
they
were
dragged
often
naked
through
the
streets
to
a
brothel
and
there
abandoned
to
the
lubricity
of
the
populace
the
piety
of
the
early
christians
prompted
the
belief
that
on
many
conspicuous
occasions
the
almighty
had
interfered
to
protect
his
chosen
children
in
this
dire
calamity
agnes
having
refused
to
sacrifice
to
vesta
was
said
to
have
been
stripped
naked
by
the
order
of
the
prefect
but
no
sooner
had
her
garments
fallen
than
her
hair
grew
miraculously
and
enveloped
her
as
in
a
shroud
dragged
to
the
brothel
a
wonderful
light
shone
from
her
body
and
the
appalled
at
the
sight
instead
of
offering
her
violence
fell
at
her
knees
till
at
last
the
son
bolder
and
more
reckless
than
the
others
advanced
to
consummate
her
sentence
and
was
struck
dead
at
her
feet
by
a
thunderbolt
theodora
a
noble
lady
of
alexandria
was
equally
undaunted
and
equally
faithful
to
her
creed
the
judge
allowed
her
three
days
to
deliberate
warning
her
of
the
consequences
of
obstinacy
she
was
firm
and
was
led
into
a
house
of
prostitution
there
in
the
midst
of
debauched
persons
of
both
sexes
she
prayed
to
god
for
help
and
the
sight
of
the
virgin
bent
in
fervent
prayer
struck
awe
into
the
minds
of
the
people
at
last
a
soldier
declared
that
he
would
fulfill
the
judgment
thrust
into
a
cell
with
theodora
he
confessed
that
he
was
a
christian
dressed
her
in
his
clothes
and
enabled
her
to
escape
he
was
seized
and
executed
but
the
christian
virgin
refusing
to
purchase
her
safety
at
such
a
price
gave
herself
up
and
died
with
him
similar
stories
are
contained
in
several
of
the
christian
fathers
there
is
unhappily
no
reason
to
doubt
that
in
many
instances
the
brutal
mandate
of
the
pagan
judges
was
rigorously
executed
and
that
the
faith
of
many
christian
virgins
was
assailed
through
the
channel
of
their
virtue
this
appears
to
have
been
frequently
the
case
during
the
persecution
of
diocletian
when
we
hear
of
christian
women
being
suspended
naked
by
one
foot
and
tortured
in
other
savage
and
infernal
ways
the
practice
led
to
the
clear
enunciation
of
the
important
doctrine
of
moral
chastity
already
stated
by
christ
himself
in
the
gospel
the
romans
could
not
conceive
a
chaste
soul
in
a
body
that
had
endured
pollution
and
hence
for
lucretia
there
was
no
resource
but
the
poniard
it
was
left
for
augustin
jerome
and
the
other
fathers
to
assert
boldly
that
the
crime
lay
in
the
intention
and
not
in
the
act
that
a
chaste
heart
might
inhabit
a
body
which
brutal
force
had
soiled
and
that
the
christian
virgins
whom
an
infamous
judge
had
sentenced
to
the
brothel
were
none
the
less
acceptable
servants
of
god
the
only
retaliation
attempted
by
the
early
christians
was
the
conversion
of
prostitutes
the
works
of
the
fathers
contain
many
narratives
of
remarkable
conversions
of
this
character
and
a
learned
jesuit
once
compiled
a
voluminous
work
on
the
subject
the
egyptian
mary
was
the
type
of
the
class
she
confessed
to
zosimus
that
she
had
spent
seventeen
years
in
the
practice
of
prostitution
at
alexandria
her
heart
being
opened
she
took
ship
for
jerusalem
paid
her
passage
by
exercising
her
calling
on
board
and
expiated
her
sins
by
a
life
of
penitence
in
the
woods
of
judæa
she
lived
the
legend
said
years
in
the
woods
naked
and
alone
without
seeing
a
man
a
chapel
was
built
at
paris
during
the
middle
ages
in
her
honor
the
painted
windows
representing
her
in
the
exercise
of
her
calling
on
shipboard
were
in
existence
at
a
very
late
period
in
revenge
for
the
victories
of
the
christians
the
pagans
accused
them
of
committing
the
grossest
immoralities
for
many
centuries
the
early
christian
congregations
met
under
circumstances
of
great
difficulty
in
secret
in
catacombs
their
religious
rites
were
performed
mysteriously
lights
were
often
extinguished
to
foil
the
object
of
spies
and
informers
these
peculiarities
served
as
the
pretext
for
many
obvious
calumnies
it
was
commonly
believed
even
by
men
of
the
calibre
of
tacitus
that
the
christian
rites
bore
strong
resemblances
to
those
rites
of
isis
which
at
an
early
period
of
roman
history
had
created
such
alarm
and
horror
at
rome
nor
were
these
calumnies
confined
to
the
heathen
in
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
when
sectarian
rivalries
menaced
the
destruction
of
the
church
similar
accusations
were
freely
bandied
that
they
were
wholly
unfounded
in
every
case
seems
difficult
to
believe
in
the
face
of
the
clear
statements
of
such
writers
as
epiphanes
what
the
precise
doctrines
of
the
various
sects
called
adamites
cainites
nicolaites
and
some
subdivisions
of
gnostics
may
have
been
it
were
perhaps
superfluous
now
to
inquire
but
it
seems
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
in
some
instances
men
of
depraved
instincts
may
have
availed
themselves
of
the
cloak
of
christianity
to
conceal
the
gratification
of
sensual
habits
or
on
the
other
hand
that
minds
in
a
state
of
religious
exaltation
may
have
stumbled
upon
impurities
in
the
search
for
the
state
of
nature
in
comparatively
late
times
we
have
seen
in
america
as
well
as
savoy
a
few
persons
of
weak
minds
give
way
to
religious
enthusiasm
in
a
manner
that
warred
with
public
decency
similar
aberrations
may
have
been
more
frequent
during
the
seething
era
which
preceded
the
establishment
of
christianity
and
prostitution
in
some
shape
or
other
may
have
again
become
a
religious
rite
in
certain
deluded
or
knavish
sects
nor
was
it
unnatural
unjust
though
it
certainly
was
for
the
heathen
to
charge
christianity
at
large
with
the
vices
of
those
of
its
followers
who
worshiped
in
a
state
of
nudity
and
accompanied
prayer
with
promiscuous
intercourse
even
in
the
bosom
of
the
true
church
practices
would
break
out
from
time
to
time
which
jarred
sadly
with
the
moral
theory
of
the
apostles
many
persons
of
both
sexes
under
the
influence
of
religious
enthusiasm
sought
relief
for
their
troubled
souls
in
solitude
and
unwisely
attempted
to
mortify
the
flesh
by
practices
which
too
often
sharpened
the
appetites
one
only
needs
to
read
the
eloquent
effusions
of
jerome
to
become
satisfied
that
the
course
of
life
adopted
by
many
early
christian
recluses
of
both
sexes
must
have
led
unwittingly
to
moral
aberrations
young
men
and
young
women
devoting
themselves
to
a
life
of
seclusion
in
the
woods
living
like
wild
beasts
without
clothing
and
without
shame
would
naturally
revive
the
system
of
religious
prostitution
in
a
more
or
less
modified
shape
on
the
other
hand
in
many
parts
of
europe
christian
churches
thought
it
not
unsafe
to
accept
the
legacies
of
the
heathen
religions
in
the
shapes
of
idols
forms
and
ceremonies
saints
succeeded
to
the
honors
of
gods
dances
in
honor
of
venus
became
dances
in
honor
of
the
virgin
statues
which
were
originally
intended
to
represent
heathen
deities
were
saved
from
destruction
by
being
adopted
as
fair
representations
of
christian
saints
until
very
recent
times
there
existed
in
various
parts
of
europe
statues
of
priapus
under
the
name
of
some
saint
retaining
the
indecency
of
the
idol
and
associated
with
the
belief
of
some
simple
women
that
the
image
possessed
the
power
assigned
it
in
mythology
in
processions
during
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
sacred
virgins
were
seen
to
wear
round
their
necks
the
obscene
symbol
of
the
old
worship
and
in
places
the
holy
bread
retained
the
shape
of
the
roman
and
john
chrysostom
complains
that
in
places
he
designates
women
were
baptized
in
a
state
of
nature
without
even
being
permitted
to
veil
their
sex
a
majority
of
christian
teachers
unwilling
to
deprive
the
masses
of
a
superstitious
convenience
afforded
them
by
paganism
allowed
them
to
pray
to
certain
saints
not
only
for
fertility
but
for
the
removal
of
impotence
from
husbands
and
lovers
to
these
immoral
features
must
be
added
occasional
instances
of
looseness
in
conventual
life
the
preamble
of
various
edicts
in
france
and
elsewhere
leaves
no
room
to
doubt
that
in
several
instances
immoral
persons
had
assumed
the
religious
garb
and
collected
themselves
together
in
religious
communities
for
the
purpose
of
gratifying
sensuality
these
were
the
aids
christianity
afforded
to
prostitution
in
its
various
forms
they
are
a
mere
trifle
in
comparison
with
the
obstacles
it
threw
in
its
way
independently
of
the
effect
produced
by
the
moral
teaching
of
paul
and
the
apostles
the
rising
power
of
the
church
was
vigorously
exerted
to
modify
the
legislation
both
of
the
eastern
and
western
empires
on
the
subject
of
sexual
depravities
the
fathers
did
not
uniformly
proscribe
prostitution
saint
augustin
said
suppress
prostitution
and
capricious
lusts
will
overthrow
society
jerome
recognized
prostitution
and
argued
that
as
mary
magdalene
had
been
saved
so
might
any
prostitute
who
repented
the
canons
of
the
apostles
excluded
from
the
ministry
all
persons
who
were
convicted
of
having
commerce
with
prostitutes
and
excommunicated
those
who
were
guilty
of
rape
but
they
passed
no
general
sentence
on
prostitutes
but
the
apostolic
constitution
branded
as
sinful
any
sexual
intercourse
non
adhibetur
ad
generationem
filiorum
sed
tota
ad
voluptatem
the
same
principle
is
asserted
in
various
passages
of
the
work
wine
being
denounced
as
a
provocation
to
impurity
and
the
faithful
are
warned
against
the
society
of
lewd
persons
the
council
of
elvira
pronounced
the
penalty
of
excommunication
against
bawds
and
prostitutes
but
it
expressly
commanded
priests
to
receive
at
the
prostitutes
who
had
married
christians
augustin
conceived
that
no
church
should
admit
prostitutes
to
the
altar
till
they
had
abandoned
the
calling
a
similar
doctrine
was
expressed
by
the
council
of
toledo
at
a
later
period
as
we
advance
in
mediæval
history
we
find
the
councils
recognizing
prostitution
and
prostitutes
as
a
class
in
at
the
council
of
basle
a
holy
father
presented
a
paper
on
the
subject
of
prostitution
in
which
it
was
implied
to
be
the
only
safeguard
of
good
morals
a
century
later
the
council
of
milan
took
especial
pains
to
identify
prostitutes
as
a
class
they
were
to
wear
a
distinctive
dress
with
no
ornaments
of
gold
silver
or
silk
to
reside
in
places
expressly
designated
by
the
bishops
at
a
distance
from
cathedrals
to
avoid
taverns
and
hostelries
the
execution
of
the
decree
was
intrusted
to
the
bishops
and
the
civil
magistrates
the
or
tax
paid
by
all
persons
subsisting
by
prostitution
was
exacted
by
the
emperors
from
caligula
to
theodosius
it
was
usually
collected
every
five
years
zosimus
accuses
constantine
of
having
enlarged
and
remodeled
the
tax
but
apparently
without
foundation
the
early
christians
made
it
a
subject
of
reproach
to
the
emperors
in
consequence
of
their
assaults
theodosius
abandoned
that
portion
of
the
law
which
laid
a
tax
on
bawds
leaving
the
tax
on
prostitutes
the
latter
was
levied
as
rigorously
as
ever
a
contemporary
writer
describes
the
imperial
agents
hunting
for
prostitutes
in
taverns
and
houses
of
prostitution
and
forcing
them
to
purchase
by
payment
of
the
tax
the
right
of
pursuing
their
calling
at
length
in
the
fifth
century
prostitution
and
the
tax
on
prostitutes
or
were
formally
abolished
by
the
emperor
anastasius
and
the
records
and
rolls
of
the
collectors
burned
it
is
said
that
some
time
afterward
the
emperor
gave
out
that
he
had
repented
of
what
he
had
done
and
desired
to
see
the
the
announcement
gave
great
joy
to
the
debauchees
and
numbers
of
persons
prepared
to
avail
themselves
of
the
of
the
law
the
emperor
let
it
be
known
that
he
desired
to
have
matters
placed
so
far
as
could
be
on
their
old
footing
and
would
therefore
desire
to
collect
as
many
as
possible
of
the
old
rolls
and
records
they
were
gathered
together
at
all
parts
and
laid
at
the
imperial
feet
notice
was
then
given
to
the
people
to
meet
at
the
circus
on
a
given
day
when
they
were
all
assembled
the
whole
collection
of
documents
was
burned
amid
the
frantic
applause
of
the
populace
it
has
been
asserted
however
that
the
was
revived
subsequently
and
was
levied
under
justinian
that
legislator
altered
the
old
roman
laws
regarding
prostitution
and
relieved
prostitutes
from
the
ineffaceable
ban
of
infamy
which
the
republican
jurisprudence
had
laid
on
them
he
permitted
the
marriage
of
citizens
with
prostitutes
and
encouraged
it
by
his
example
his
own
wife
the
empress
theodora
had
been
a
and
a
prostitute
when
she
attained
the
imperial
dignity
her
first
thought
was
of
her
old
companions
she
built
a
magnificent
on
the
south
shore
of
the
bosphorus
and
in
one
night
caused
five
hundred
prostitutes
in
constantinople
to
be
seized
and
conveyed
thither
they
were
kindly
treated
their
every
wish
was
gratified
but
no
man
entered
their
asylum
the
experiment
was
a
complete
failure
most
of
the
girls
committed
suicide
in
their
despair
and
the
remainder
soon
died
of
and
vexation
theodosius
had
laid
heavy
penalties
on
justinian
reiterated
them
and
increased
their
weight
the
seizure
and
prostitution
of
a
girl
he
punished
with
death
he
who
connived
at
the
prostitution
of
females
was
to
be
expelled
from
the
city
where
he
lived
and
any
person
harboring
him
was
to
be
fined
one
hundred
gold
pieces
whatever
legislation
could
effect
to
uproot
the
system
of
procurers
and
public
prostitution
justinian
did
but
his
laws
contain
no
trace
of
any
harsh
policy
toward
prostitutes
those
unfortunate
creatures
he
regarded
with
an
indulgent
humanity
which
for
the
sake
of
human
nature
one
may
perhaps
ascribe

debaucheries

played
a
prominent

the

which
occasionally
strove
to
redeem

disgraceful

so
far
as

were

there
is
no

the

judged
correctly

tempered
the
ardor
of
northern
sensuality

the
harshness
of

the

from
the

of

unknown
an
old
law
or
usage
directed
that
prostitutes
should
be
stoned
but
we
do
not
hear
of
this
law
being
carried
into
effect
simultaneously
with
the
consolidation
of
the
kingdom
of
the
franks
we
note
that
concubinage
was
an
established
institution
recognized
by
the
law
and
sanctioned
by
the
church
all
the
frank
chiefs
who
could
afford
the
luxury
kept
harems
or
as
they
were
called
in
that
day
peopled
by
young
girls
who
ministered
to
their
pleasures
the
plan
as
it
appears
bore
some
resemblance
to
that
which
is
at
present
in
use
in
turkey
and
some
other
mohammedan
countries
the
chief
had
one
lawful
and
proper
wife
a
sort
of
and
other
wives
whose
matrimonial
rights
were
less
clearly
defined
but
still
whose
condition
was
not
necessarily
disreputable
how
the
people
lived
we
are
not
so
well
qualified
to
say
but
no
doubt
prostitution
prevailed
to
some
extent
among
them
though
in
all
probability
the
public
morals
were
purer
than
they
became
toward
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
perhaps
the
first
authentic
legislative
notice
of
prostitution
in
france
is
to
be
found
in
the
capitularies
of
charlemagne
that
monarch
who
seems
to
have
seen
no
mischief
in
the
system
of
was
severe
upon
common
prostitution
he
directed
vulgar
prostitutes
to
be
scourged
and
a
like
penalty
to
be
inflicted
on
all
who
harbored
them
kept
houses
of
debauch
or
lent
their
assistance
to
prostitutes
or
debauchees
in
other
words
charlemagne
treated
the
same
act
as
a
crime
among
the
poor
and
as
an
excusable
habit
among
the
rich
our
information
regarding
society
in
the
middle
ages
is
necessarily
obscure
and
scanty
but
we
have
enough
to
learn
that
immorality
prevailed
to
an
alarming
degree
during
the
tenth
eleventh
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
probably
the
rich
men
who
had
their
were
the
most
virtuous
class
in
the
nation
most
of
the
kings
set
an
example
of
loose
intercourse
with
the
ladies
of
the
court
the
armies
of
the
time
were
noted
for
the
ravages
they
committed
among
the
female
population
of
the
countries
where
they
were
quartered
both
of
these
classes
seem
to
have
yielded
the
palm
of
debauchery
to
the
clergy
it
is
a
fact
well
known
to
antiquaries
though
visual
evidence
of
it
is
becoming
scarce
that
most
of
the
great
works
of
gothic
architecture
which
date
from
this
period
were
profusely
adorned
with
lewd
sculptures
whose
subjects
were
taken
from
the
religious
orders
in
one
place
a
monk
was
represented
in
carnal
connection
with
a
female
devotee
in
others
were
seen
an
abbot
engaged
with
nuns
a
naked
nun
worried
by
monkeys
youthful
penitents
undergoing
flagellation
at
the
hands
of
their
confessor
lady
abbesses
offering
hospitality
to
strangers
etc
these
obscene
works
of
art
formerly
encumbered
the
doors
windows
arches
and
niches
of
many
of
the
finest
gothic
cathedrals
in
france
modesty
has
lately
insisted
on
their
removal
but
many
of
the
works
themselves
have
been
rescued
from
destruction
by
the
zeal
of
antiquaries
and
it
is
believed
some
have
still
escaped
the
iconoclastic
hand
of
the
modern
church
when
such
was
the
condition
of
the
clergy
and
such
the
notoriety
of
that
condition
it
would
be
unjustifiable
to
expect
purity
of
morals
among
the
people
louis
viii
made
an
effort
to
regulate
prostitution
it
proved
fruitless
and
it
was
left
to
the
next
king
of
the
same
name
louis
to
make
the
first
serious
endeavor
to
check
the
progress
of
the
evil
in
france
his
edict
which
dates
from
directed
that
all
prostitutes
and
persons
making
a
living
indirectly
out
of
prostitution
such
as
and
procurers
should
be
forthwith
exiled
from
the
kingdom
it
was
partially
put
in
force
a
large
number
of
unfortunate
females
were
seized
and
imprisoned
or
sent
across
the
frontier
severe
punishments
were
inflicted
on
those
who
returned
to
the
city
of
paris
after
their
expulsion
a
panic
seized
the
customers
of
brothels
and
for
a
few
months
public
decency
was
restored
but
the
inevitable
consequences
of
the
arbitrary
decree
of
the
king
soon
began
to
be
felt
though
the
officers
of
justice
had
forcibly
confined
in
establishments
resembling
magdalen
hospitals
a
large
proportion
of
the
most
notorious
prostitutes
and
exiled
many
more
others
arose
to
take
their
places
clandestine
traffic
succeeded
to
the
former
open
and
in
the
dark
the
evils
of
the
disease
were
necessarily
aggravated
more
than
that
as
has
usually
been
the
case
when
prostitution
has
been
violently
and
suddenly
suppressed
the
number
of
virtuous
women
became
less
and
corruption
invaded
the
family
circle
tradesmen
complained
that
since
the
passage
of
the
ordinance
they
found
it
impossible
to
guard
the
virtue
of
their
wives
and
daughters
against
the
enterprises
of
the
military
and
the
students
at
last
complaints
of
the
evil
effects
of
the
ordinance
became
so
general
and
so
pressing
that
after
a
lapse
of
two
years
it
was
repealed
a
new
royal
decree
prostitution
under
rules
which
though
not
particularly
enlightened
or
humane
still
placed
it
on
a
sounder
footing
than
it
had
occupied
before
the
royal
attention
had
been
directed
to
the
subject
prostitutes
were
forbidden
to
live
in
certain
parts
of
the
city
of
paris
were
not
allowed
to
wear
jewelry
or
fine
stuffs
and
were
placed
under
the
direct
supervision
of
a
police
magistrate
whose
official
or
popular
title
was
roi
des
the
king
of
ribaldry
the
duties
of
this
officer
appear
to
have
been
analogous
to
those
of
the
roman
ædiles
who
had
charge
of
prostitution
he
was
empowered
to
arrest
and
confine
females
who
infringed
the
law
either
in
their
dress
their
domicil
or
their
behavior
it
was
afterward
urged
against
the
maintenance
of
the
office
of
des
that
it
was
usually
filled
by
reckless
depraved
men
who
discharged
its
duties
more
in
view
of
their
private
interests
and
the
gratification
of
their
sensuality
than
from
regard
to
the
public
morals
instances
of
gross
tyranny
were
proved
against
them
and
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
show
that
their
appointment
had
been
beneficial
to
the
public
but
little
regret
was
felt
when
the
office
was
abolished
by
francis
i
to
return
to
louis
ix
in
his
old
age
he
repented
of
what
he
had
done
and
returned
to
the
spirit
of
his
early
ordinance
in
his
instructions
to
his
son
and
successor
he
adjured
him
to
remove
from
his
country
the
shameful
stain
of
prostitution
and
indicated
plainly
enough
that
the
best
mode
of
attaining
that
end
would
be
by
the
ordinance
of
philip
dutifully
fulfilled
his
father
request
prostitution
was
again
declared
a
legal
misdemeanor
and
a
formidable
array
of
penalties
was
again
brought
to
bear
against
offending
females
and
their
accomplices
but
like
many
a
legislative
act
in
more
modern
times
philip
ordinance
was
too
obviously
at
variance
with
public
policy
and
popular
sentiment
to
be
carried
into
effect
it
was
quietly
allowed
to
remain
a
dead
letter
and
with
probably
few
exceptions
the
prostitutes
of
paris
pursued
their
calling
unmolested
a
few
years
afterward
its
nullification
was
authoritatively
sanctioned
by
fresh
sumptuary
laws
a
royal
edict
directed
courtesans
to
wear
a
of
a
particular
color
as
a
badge
of
their
calling
the
whole
force
of
the
government
was
rallied
to
enforce
this
rule
and
also
those
which
had
been
enacted
by
louis
ix
the
records
of
the
court
contain
innumerable
reports
of
the
arrests
of
prostitutes
for
violating
these
enactments
when
they
had
taken
up
their
abode
in
a
prohibited
street
they
were
imprisoned
and
dislodged
when
their
offense
was
wearing
unlawful
garments
or
jewelry
the
forbidden
objects
were
seized
and
sold
the
constable
apparently
sharing
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
pimps
and
procurers
were
dealt
with
more
severely
as
usual
the
contained
a
variety
of
conflicting
enactments
on
this
subject
and
menaced
them
with
all
kinds
of
penalties
from
burning
alive
to
fine
and
imprisonment
it
appears
beyond
a
doubt
that
during
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
several
notorious
procuresses
were
burned
alive
at
paris
others
were
put
in
the
pillory
were
scourged
and
had
their
ears
cropped
while
many
of
the
richer
class
escaped
with
a
fine
there
are
records
of
cases
in
which
the
procuress
was
exposed
naked
to
the
insults
of
the
mob
for
a
whole
day
and
toward
evening
the
hair
on
her
body
was
burned
off
with
a
flaming
torch
others
again
were
chased
through
the
city
in
a
state
of
nudity
and
pelted
with
stones
these
barbarous
penalties
appear
to
have
been
very
much
to
the
taste
of
the
people
procuresses
have
always
been
an
odious
class
and
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
the
punishment
of
a
notorious
wretch
of
the
class
was
observed
as
a
joyous
holiday
by
the
populace
of
the
french
capital
on
the
other
hand
the
prostitutes
themselves
were
often
subjects
of
public
sympathy
peculiar
reasons
operated
at
this
period
to
produce
a
favorable
sentiment
with
regard
to
prostitutes
the
horrible
depravities
of
the
templars
were
becoming
known
society
was
at
the
symptom
of
a
revival
of
the
worst
vice
of
the
ancients
there
have
been
as
is
known
ingenious
and
eloquent
efforts
made
in
comparatively
recent
times
to
throw
a
veil
over
the
corruptions
of
the
templars
and
to
prove
that
they
fell
victims
to
royal
jealousy
but
the
argument
is
not
sustained
by
the
facts
documents
on
whose
authenticity
and
credibility
no
possible
suspicion
can
be
cast
establish
incontrovertibly
that
the
sect
of
the
templars
was
tainted
with
unnatural
vices
and
that
one
of
the
chief
secrets
of
its
maintenance
was
the
facility
it
afforded
to
debased
men
for
the
gratification
of
monstrous
propensities
that
this
was
the
opinion
which
prevailed
in
paris
at
the
time
of
the
outburst
which
finally
led
to
the
suppression
of
the
order
there
is
no
room
to
question
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
the
horror
such
discoveries
must
have
awakened
would
lead
men
to
entertain
more
lenient
views
with
regard
to
a
vice
which
had
at
least
the
merit
of
being
in
conformity
with
natural
instinct
thus
far
of
paris
only
during
the
middle
ages
as
is
well
known
most
of
the
provinces
of
france
were
communities
which
administered
their
own
affairs
and
received
no
police
regulations
from
the
crown
a
complete
examination
of
the
subject
throughout
france
would
therefore
involve
as
many
histories
as
there
were
provinces
our
space
of
course
forbids
any
thing
of
the
kind
and
we
can
only
glance
at
leading
divisions
most
of
the
northern
people
had
adopted
partly
from
the
old
germanic
constitutions
and
partly
from
the
roman
law
severe
provisions
against
prostitution
but
they
were
nowhere
apparently
put
in
force
occasionally
a
notorious
or
professional
procuress
was
severely
punished
but
prostitutes
were
rarely
molested
in
the
north
and
west
of
france
indeed
toleration
was
obviously
the
natural
policy
for
we
are
not
led
to
believe
that
in
that
section
of
country
the
evil
was
ever
carried
to
great
excess
in
normandy
brittany
picardy
and
the
great
northern
and
western
provinces
a
virtuous
simplicity
was
the
rule
of
life
among
the
peasants
and
even
the
cities
did
not
present
any
striking
contrast
in
many
provinces
usage
not
fortified
by
the
text
of
any
custom
allowed
the
seigneur
to
levy
toll
upon
prostitutes
exercising
their
calling
within
the
limits
of
his
jurisdiction
some
old
titles
and
records
refer
to
this
practice
one
sets
down
the
tax
paid
by
each
prostitute
at
four
to
the
seigneur
others
intimate
that
the
tax
may
be
paid
in
money
or
in
kind
at
the
option
of
the
seigneur
in
many
seigniories
this
singular
tax
was
regarded
with
the
contempt
it
deserved
in
the
south
of
france
we
meet
with
a
different
spectacle
there
prostitution
had
long
been
a
feature
of
society
the
warm
passions
of
the
southerners
required
a
vent
and
in
the
absence
of
some
it
was
obvious
to
all
that
the
ungovernable
lusts
of
the
men
would
soon
kindle
the
inflammable
passions
of
the
dark
southern
women
public
houses
of
prostitution
were
therefore
established
in
three
of
the
largest
cities
of
the
south
toulouse
avignon
and
montpellier
that
of
toulouse
was
established
by
royal
charter
which
declared
that
the
profits
of
the
enterprise
should
be
shared
equally
by
the
city
and
the
university
the
building
appropriated
for
the
purpose
was
large
and
commodious
bearing
the
name
of
the
in
it
were
lodged
not
only
the
resident
prostitutes
of
the
city
but
any
loose
women
who
traveled
that
way
and
desired
to
exercise
their
impure
calling
it
would
appear
that
they
received
a
salary
from
the
city
and
that
the
fees
exacted
from
the
customers
were
divided
between
the
two
public
bodies
to
which
the
enterprise
was
granted
they
were
obliged
to
wear
white
scarfs
and
white
ribbons
or
cords
on
one
of
their
arms
as
a
badge
of
their
calling
when
the
unfortunate
monarch
charles
vi
visited
toulouse
the
prostitutes
of
the
abbaye
met
him
in
a
body
and
presented
an
address
the
king
received
them
graciously
and
promised
to
grant
them
whatever
largess
they
should
request
they
begged
to
be
released
from
the
duty
of
wearing
the
white
badges
and
the
king
faithful
to
his
promise
granted
the
boon
a
royal
declaration
specially
exempted
them
from
the
old
rule
but
the
people
of
toulouse
no
doubt
irritated
by
the
want
of
some
distinguishing
mark
between
their
wives
and
daughters
and
the
foolish
women
by
common
consent
mobbed
the
prostitutes
who
availed
themselves
of
the
ordinance
none
of
them
could
venture
to
appear
in
public
without
being
liable
to
insult
and
even
bodily
injury
resolutely
bent
on
carrying
their
point
the
women
shut
themselves
up
in
the
abbaye
and
did
their
best
to
keep
customers
at
a
distance
their
calculation
was
just
the
city
and
the
university
soon
felt
the
effects
of
the
diminution
of
visitors
at
the
abbaye
the
corporation
appealed
to
the
king
and
when
during
the
disorders
which
distracted
france
at
that
time
charles
vii
visited
toulouse
a
formal
petition
was
presented
to
him
by
the
praying
that
he
would
take
such
steps
as
his
wisdom
might
seem
fit
to
mediate
between
the
prostitutes
and
the
people
and
restore
to
the
abbaye
its
former
prosperity
the
king
acted
with
energy
he
denounced
the
assailants
of
the
prostitutes
in
the
severest
language
and
planted
his
own
royal
de
over
the
door
of
the
abbaye
as
a
protection
to
the
occupants
but
the
people
did
not
respect
the
royal
arms
any
more
than
they
did
the
foolish
women
on
the
contrary
assaults
on
the
abbaye
became
more
numerous
than
ever
the
prostitutes
complained
incessantly
of
having
suffered
violence
at
the
hands
of
wild
youths
who
refused
to
pay
for
their
pleasures
and
the
civic
authorities
proving
incompetent
to
check
the
disorder
the
prostitutes
found
themselves
compelled
to
seek
refuge
in
a
new
part
of
the
city
where
it
is
to
be
presumed
they
enlisted
adequate
support
among
their
own
individual
acquaintances
for
a
hundred
years
they
inhabited
their
new
domicil
in
peace
and
quiet
the
university
then
dislodging
them
in
order
to
occupy
the
spot
the
city
built
them
a
new
abbaye
beyond
the
precincts
of
the
respectable
wards
it
was
called
the
and
its
fame
and
profits
equaled
that
of
the
old
abbaye
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
city
yielded
to
the
scruples
of
some
moralists
of
the
day
and
ceded
the
revenues
of
the
chateau
vert
to
the
hospitals
but
the
grant
being
made
on
condition
that
the
hospitals
should
receive
and
cure
all
females
attacked
by
venereal
disease
it
was
found
after
six
years
trial
that
it
cost
more
than
it
yielded
the
hospitals
surrendered
the
chateau
to
the
city
it
happened
just
at
this
time
that
many
eminent
philosophers
and
economists
were
advocating
a
return
to
the
old
ecclesiastical
policy
of
suppressing
prostitution
altogether
after
a
discussion
which
lasted
several
years
the
city
of
toulouse
adopted
these
views
and
closed
the
chateau
vert
a
magistrate
high
in
authority
left
on
record
his
protest
against
this
course
founded
on
the
scenes
of
immorality
he
had
himself
witnessed
in
the
suburbs
and
the
country
in
the
neighborhood
of
toulouse
but
the
city
authorities
adhered
to
their
opinion
and
contented
themselves
with
arresting
some
of
the
most
shameless
of
the
free
prostitutes
from
that
time
forth
prostitution
at
toulouse
was
subject
to
the
same
rules
as
in
the
rest
of
france
the
history
of
prostitution
at
montpellier
was
analogous
at
an
early
period
the
monopoly
which
the
crown
had
granted
to
the
city
being
farmed
out
to
individuals
fell
into
the
hands
of
two
bankers
in
whose
family
it
remained
for
several
generations
during
their
tenure
a
brothel
was
established
in
the
city
by
a
speculator
of
the
day
but
the
holders
of
the
monopoly
prosecuted
him
and
obtained
a
perpetual
injunction
restraining
him
from
lodging
or
harboring
prostitutes
at
avignon
prostitution
was
legalized
by
jane
of
naples
just
before
the
cession
of
the
city
to
the
pope
the
ordinance
establishing
a
public
brothel
seems
to
have
been
drawn
with
care
and
though
doubts
have
lately
been
thrown
on
its
authenticity
they
are
not
so
well
founded
as
to
justify
its
rejection
prostitutes
were
ordered
to
live
in
the
brothel
they
were
bound
to
wear
a
red
as
a
badge
of
their
calling
the
brothel
was
to
be
visited
weekly
by
the
bailli
and
a
barber
the
latter
of
whom
was
to
examine
the
girls
and
confine
separately
all
who
seemed
infected
no
jew
was
allowed
to
enter
the
brothel
on
any
pretext
its
doors
were
to
be
closed
on
saints
days
and
special
regulations
guarded
against
the
prevalence
of
scenes
of
riot
and
disorder
this
ordinance
seems
to
have
remained
in
force
during
the
whole
occupation
of
avignon
by
the
popes
and
its
penalties
were
occasionally
inflicted
on
offenders
but
if
petrarch
and
other
contemporary
writers
are
to
be
believed
the
city
was
none
the
less
a
refuge
for
debauchees
and
a
scandal
to
christendom
petrarch
complains
that
it
was
far
more
depraved
than
old
rome
and
a
popular
proverb
confirms
at
least
in
part
his
opinion
there
were
however
in
some
southern
provinces
severe
laws
against
prostitution
although
some
of
the
penalties
seem
to
have
been
framed
as
much
with
the
view
of
stimulating
as
of
repressing
the
passions
in
one
or
two
cities
we
find
accounts
of
prostitutes
and
their
customers
being
forced
to
walk
naked
through
the
streets
by
way
of
expiation
in
others
the
punishment
of
the
iron
cage
was
inflicted
on
pimps
and
procuresses
when
a
procuress
had
rendered
herself
particularly
obnoxious
she
was
seized
stripped
naked
and
dragged
in
the
midst
of
a
great
crowd
to
the
water
side
there
she
was
thrust
into
an
iron
cage
in
which
she
was
forced
to
kneel
when
the
cage
door
was
closed
she
was
thrown
into
the
river
and
allowed
to
remain
under
water
long
enough
to
produce
temporary
suffocation
this
shocking
punishment
was
repeated
several
times
a
potent
influence
over
the
morals
of
the
southern
people
the
higher
classes
at
least
was
exercised
by
the
institution
of
chivalry
it
was
of
the
essence
of
that
institution
to
promote
spiritual
at
the
expense
of
sensual
gratification
the
chevalier
adored
his
mistress
in
secret
for
years
without
even
venturing
to
breathe
her
name
for
years
he
carried
a
scarf
or
a
ribbon
in
her
honor
through
and
dangers
of
every
kind
happy
when
after
a
lustrum
spent
in
sighs
and
hopes
the
charmer
condescended
to
reward
his
fidelity
with
a
gracious
smile
it
is
evident
that
sexual
intercourse
must
have
been
rare
among
people
who
set
so
high
a
value
on
the
merest
compliments
and
slightest
tokens
of
affection
nor
can
there
be
any
question
but
the
effect
of
chivalry
was
to
impart
a
high
tone
to
the
feelings
and
language
of
society
and
to
soften
the
manners
of
all
who
came
within
its
influence
if
on
the
other
hand
we
glance
at
the
literature
which
flourished
in
france
during
the
period
of
the
revival
of
learning
we
can
not
but
infer
that
the
morals
of
the
people
at
large
were
not
pure
during
the
thirteenth
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
the
standard
reading
of
the
educated
classes
among
the
french
was
the
celebrated
de
la
a
work
of
remarkable
talent
but
at
the
same
time
distinguished
by
a
cynic
vein
of
philosophy
and
a
singular
obscenity
of
language
no
portion
of
that
work
was
wholly
free
from
lewd
expressions
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
quote
fifty
lines
of
it
in
a
modern
language
the
doctrine
of
the
author
with
regard
to
women
was
insulting
and
cynical
they
were
uniformly
depicted
as
being
restrained
only
by
legal
difficulties
from
giving
way
to
the
loosest
passions
and
all
men
in
like
manner
were
painted
as
seducers
adulterers
and
violators
of
young
girls
such
was
the
reading
of
the
best
society
in
france
the
de
la
was
to
them
what
shakspeare
is
to
us
nor
was
it
alone
of
its
kind
of
the
works
which
that
age
has
bequeathed
to
us
nearly
all
are
tainted
with
the
same
grossness
of
language
and
pruriency
of
idea
all
or
nearly
all
breathe
the
air
of
the
brothel
it
was
rather
a
matter
of
boasting
than
of
shame
with
the
authors
villon
and
regnier
seem
to
plume
themselves
on
their
familiarity
with
scenes
of
debauch
and
their
extensive
acquaintance
among
the
prostitute
class
the
best
of
their
works
are
descriptions
of
episodes
of
dissipation
their
most
lively
sketches
have
prostitutes
or
their
fortunes
or
their
diseases
for
the
themes
they
seemed
to
fancy
they
were
imitating
horace
when
they
borrowed
his
most
odious
blemishes
some
of
them
were
actors
as
well
as
poets
and
used
the
machinery
of
the
stage
to
disseminate
their
lewd
compositions
though
it
was
still
unusual
or
even
unlawful
for
women
to
appear
on
the
stage
in
their
time
the
boys
who
played
female
parts
were
well
drilled
to
the
business
and
the
performances
which
delighted
the
towns
and
villages
of
france
fell
but
little
short
in
point
of
grossness
of
the
theatrical
enormities
of
the
imperial
era
at
rome
one
may
form
some
idea
of
the
popularity
of
erotic
literature
at
this
period
in
france
from
the
amazing
vocabulary
of
erotic
terms
which
is
gathered
from
the
works
of
rabelais
beroald
de
verville
regnier
brantome
and
their
contemporaries
there
was
not
a
form
of
lewdness
for
which
an
appropriate
name
had
not
been
invented
and
as
to
the
ordinary
acts
and
instruments
of
prostitution
a
dictionary
of
synonyms
might
have
been
compiled
without
embracing
all
of
them
monsieur
dufour
in
his
conscientious
work
fills
a
couple
of
pages
with
the
mere
words
that
were
employed
to
express
the
act
of
fornication
many
events
likewise
indicate
a
loose
state
of
morals
the
history
of
the
and
filling
some
space
in
every
treatise
on
demonology
is
a
most
curious
feature
of
the
morals
of
the
day
the
existence
of
demons
who
made
a
practice
of
assailing
the
virtue
of
girls
and
boys
was
admitted
by
some
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
who
quoted
the
words
of
genesis
in
support
of
the
singular
doctrine
they
were
of
two
kinds
from
the
latin
male
demons
who
assailed
the
chastity
of
girls
and
female
demons
who
robbed
boys
of
their
innocence
the
old
chronicles
are
full
of
accounts
of
the
mischievous
deeds
of
these
evil
spirits
as
might
be
expected
the
were
more
numerous
and
more
enterprising
than
the
for
one
boy
who
confessed
that
a
female
demon
had
attacked
him
in
his
sleep
and
compelled
him
to
minister
to
her
sensuality
there
were
a
score
of
girls
who
furnished
very
tolerable
evidence
of
having
yielded
their
virginity
to
creatures
of
the
male
gender
who
they
were
satisfied
could
be
none
other
than
devils
the
ecclesiastical
writers
of
the
period
have
preserved
a
number
of
scandalous
stories
of
the
kind
which
were
so
well
credited
that
pope
innocent
viii
felt
impelled
to
issue
a
bull
on
the
subject
and
provide
the
faithful
with
an
efficacious
formula
of
exorcism
females
most
of
whom
appeared
to
be
nuns
confessed
that
they
had
been
subject
to
the
scandalous
visits
of
the
demons
for
long
periods
of
time
and
that
neither
fasting
nor
prayer
nor
spiritual
exercise
could
release
them
from
the
hated
plague
some
girls
were
brought
to
admit
a
similar
intercourse
and
were
burnt
at
the
stake
as
partakers
of
the
nature
of
sorceresses
married
women
made
similar
confessions
they
stated
that
they
were
able
to
affirm
that
intercourse
with
demons
was
extremely
painful
that
their
frigid
nature
combined
with
their
monstrous
proportions
rendered
their
society
a
severe
affliction
independently
of
the
sin
it
was
noticed
that
the
women
married
or
single
who
applied
to
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
for
relief
from
this
curious
form
of
torment
were
almost
invariably
young
and
pretty
in
the
year
a
public
discussion
took
place
at
paris
on
the
question
whether
there
exist
and
and
whether
they
can
procreate
their
species
the
discussion
was
long
and
elaborate
it
was
conducted
by
a
body
of
learned
doctors
in
presence
of
a
large
audience
composed
partly
of
ladies
and
while
the
judgment
of
the
tribunal
appeared
to
be
in
the
negative
it
was
not
so
emphatic
as
to
settle
the
question
even
a
century
later
when
one
of
the
royal
physicians
undertook
to
explode
the
theory
of
lewd
demons
and
to
prove
that
girls
had
endeavored
to
conceal
their
intercourse
with
lovers
by
attributing
to
them
a
devilish
character
the
public
was
not
convinced
and
the
were
not
left
without
believers
the
laws
still
pronounced
the
penalty
of
death
against
all
persons
male
or
female
who
had
commerce
with
demons
another
practice
which
was
brought
to
a
close
about
the
same
time
was
entitled
sabat
des
the
witches
vigil
it
appears
that
at
the
earliest
times
of
which
we
have
any
record
the
inhabitants
of
france
and
germany
were
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
nocturnal
assemblies
in
which
witchcraft
was
believed
or
pretended
to
occupy
a
prominent
place
in
the
thirteenth
century
they
were
denounced
by
pope
gregory
who
was
satisfied
that
the
devil
had
to
do
with
them
and
that
their
prime
object
was
the
gratification
of
sensuality
his
bull
did
not
attain
its
object
the
witches
meetings
were
still
held
or
believed
to
have
been
held
throughout
the
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
part
of
the
sixteenth
centuries
the
popular
belief
was
that
the
persons
in
league
with
witches
anointed
their
bodies
with
magical
ointment
bestrode
a
broom
and
were
forthwith
carried
through
the
air
to
the
place
of
meeting
that
satan
was
present
at
the
ceremony
in
the
form
of
a
huge
and
received
the
homage
of
the
witches
and
their
proselytes
that
songs
and
dances
followed
next
in
order
and
that
the
whole
performance
was
closed
with
a
scene
of
promiscuous
debauchery
the
inquisition
took
the
matter
in
hand
and
obtained
affidavits
from
several
females
averring
that
they
had
had
commerce
with
demons
on
these
occasions
and
relating
with
singular
crudity
the
peculiar
sensations
they
experienced
on
the
strength
of
this
evidence
prosecutions
were
instituted
and
many
persons
were
condemned
and
executed
it
has
been
usual
in
modern
times
to
regard
the
persecution
of
the
witches
as
a
proof
of
the
barbarous
intolerance
of
the
ancient
church
but
in
truth
a
careful
examination
of
the
evidence
leaves
no
room
for
doubting
that
witchcraft
was
only
the
cloak
of
real
vices
most
of
the
persons
who
were
burned
in
france
as
sorcerers
had
really
used
the
popular
belief
in
magic
to
hide
their
own
debaucheries
and
had
succeeded
in
depraving
large
numbers
of
youth
of
both
sexes
it
was
stated
by
a
theological
writer
of
the
time
of
francis
that
in
his
day
there
were
one
hundred
thousand
persons
sold
to
satan
in
france
allowing
for
some
exaggeration
it
must
still
be
inferred
from
this
statement
that
this
form
of
prostitution
had
assumed
alarming
proportions
nor
is
there
any
good
reason
for
doubting
but
priests
and
other
persons
of
lewd
propensities
turned
the
simplicity
of
the
village
girls
to
account
in
very
many
instances
and
richly
earned
the
severe
penalty
that
was
inflicted
upon
them
by
the
arm
of
the
church
the
vigil
or
disappears
from
history
during
the
sixteenth
century
that
it
had
been
for
some
time
before
its
extinction
a
haunt
of
debauchees
and
a
fertile
source
of
prostitution
the
writers
on
demonology
and
the
old
chroniclers
establish
incontrovertibly
other
aids
to
prostitution
were
obtained
from
the
very
ranks
of
the
church
during
the
middle
ages
numbers
of
strange
sects
appeared
many
of
which
relied
for
success
on
the
favor
they
allowed
to
sensuality
at
the
present
day
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
what
proportion
of
the
stories
that
are
in
print
respecting
many
of
these
sects
were
the
fruit
of
sectarian
jealousy
on
the
part
of
their
rivals
some
of
them
were
doubtless
calumniated
but
there
are
others
about
whose
character
and
practices
there
is
no
room
for
controversy
the
flagellants
for
instance
who
counted
eight
hundred
thousand
proselytes
in
france
in
the
fourteenth
century
were
unquestionably
depraved
they
marched
in
procession
men
and
women
together
through
the
cities
of
france
each
member
of
the
society
using
the
whip
freely
on
the
bare
back
of
the
person
before
him
and
at
night
they
assembled
in
country
places
and
proceeded
to
more
serious
flagellations
the
opinion
of
learned
persons
ascribed
erotic
effects
to
these
flagellations
it
being
said
apparently
with
truth
that
when
the
flagellants
had
excited
their
senses
by
their
discipline
they
gave
way
to
frantic
debauchery
however
this
be
it
is
plain
that
the
spectacle
of
naked
men
and
women
marching
in
procession
and
scourging
one
another
can
not
but
have
been
provocative
of
prostitution
another
similar
sect
was
the
adamites
who
argued
that
nudity
was
the
law
of
nature
and
that
clothes
were
an
abomination
in
the
sight
of
god
it
is
said
that
at
first
the
adamites
insisted
on
nudity
only
during
their
religious
exercises
and
that
their
proselytes
stripped
themselves
within
the
place
of
worship
but
one
picard
who
became
a
leading
authority
in
the
sect
took
the
ground
that
their
principles
should
be
carried
out
boldly
in
the
face
of
the
world
he
and
his
followers
male
and
female
accordingly
appeared
in
the
streets
in
the
costume
in
which
they
were
born
the
inquisition
very
properly
laid
hands
on
them
punished
some
and
exiled
the
others
again
if
we
pass
from
individual
accidents
to
the
state
of
society
at
large
we
shall
find
many
features
that
can
not
have
been
aids
to
virtue
allusion
has
already
been
made
to
the
obscene
character
of
much
of
the
early
poetry
of
france
and
to
the
excessive
grossness
of
those
works
especially
which
obtained
and
perhaps
deserved
the
widest
popularity
many
of
the
customs
of
the
day
were
equally
adverse
to
sound
morals
to
cite
one
by
way
of
example
on
the
des
which
fell
on
the
of
december
men
were
allowed
to
invade
the
of
girls
and
if
they
could
find
them
in
bed
to
administer
the
chastisement
which
used
to
be
common
in
schools
hence
arose
the
proverbial
expression
les
innocents
à
which
meant
to
birch
a
person
on
the
bare
skin
no
doubt
the
old
chroniclers
were
justified
in
saying
that
when
the
girl
was
worth
the
trouble
the
invader
of
the
chamber
was
not
satisfied
with
inflicting
a
chastisement
marriages
were
attended
with
ceremonies
far
grosser
than
any
that
were
practiced
in
rome
it
was
not
only
decorous
it
was
fashionable
both
for
men
and
women
to
spy
out
the
of
the
couple
and
the
fortunate
man
or
girl
who
had
contrived
to
see
the
interior
of
the
room
through
a
chink
in
the
wall
or
a
hole
in
the
door
was
loudly
applauded
when
the
result
of
his
or
her
discoveries
was
made
known
the
invention
of
bridal
chambers
is
therefore
not
original
in
america
as
some
have
supposed
strange
to
say
neither
the
lewdness
of
the
poets
nor
the
grossness
of
the
social
habits
of
the
times
strikes
one
as
more
singular
than
the
tone
of
the
sermons
which
were
delivered
in
paris
at
the
same
period
one
of
the
most
famous
preachers
of
the
day
was
maillard
who
rose
to
eminence
under
louis
xi
his
sermons
on
the
luxury
and
corruptions
of
the
times
were
very
popular
we
find
him
cursing
the
burgesses
who
for
the
sake
of
gain
let
their
houses
to
prostitutes
vivere
de
posterioribus
he
cries
indignantly
he
denounces
with
extraordinary
virulence
the
crimes
of
impudicity
which
are
committed
in
churches
and
which
the
pillars
and
nave
would
denounce
if
they
had
eyes
and
a
voice
he
did
not
spare
his
congregation
turning
fiercely
to
the
women
who
sat
before
him
he
apostrophized
them
dicatis

dicitis
he
thunders
against
this
latter
class
the
procuresses
who
ought
he
says
to
be
burned
at
the
stake
especially
when
as
is
often
the
case
they
are
both
the
mothers
and
the
venders
of
their
daughters
words
fail
him
to
denounce
the
intercourse
of
abandoned
women
with
ecclesiastics
he
invokes
the
divine
wrath
upon
those
of
his
congregation
dant

both
he
and
other
famous
preachers
of
the
day
pronounced
maledictions
upon
lewd
convents
which
some
of
them
say
are
mere
seraglios
for
the
bishops
and
monks
where
every
abomination
is
practiced
it
was
estimated
that
at
this
time
say
the
fifteenth
century
when
paris
was
comparatively
a
small
city
it
contained
five
to
six
thousand
prostitutes
who
were
said
by
an
italian
to
be
far
more
beautiful
and
attractive
than
any
prostitutes

the

will
enable
the
reader
to
form
an
idea
of
the
state
of
society
at
large
it
remains
to
say
something
of
the
court
which
in
some
respects
was
france
from
louis
ix
to
charles
inclusive
it
is
said
that
the
kings
of
france
set
no
example
of
debauchery
and
that
the
court
rather
encouraged
virtue
than
vice
when
the
of
philip
the
handsome
scandalized
paris
by
their
loose
life
in
the
tour
de
nesle
into
which
they
were
said
to
make
a
practice
of
inveigling
students
whom
they
assassinated
when
their
lubricity
was
satiated
the
king
had
them
brought
to
punishment
and
dealt
with
as
though
the
popular
scandal
was
well
founded
in
fact
when
charles
vi
ascended
the
throne
the
scene
changed
this
unfortunate
monarch
was
not
only
himself
weak
and
depraved
but
his
wife
isabel
of
bavaria
was
more
vicious
still
the
pair
encouraged
every
practice
that
could
shock
modesty
or
outrage
decency
the
queen
lived
almost
openly
with
her
lover
the
duke
of
orleans
the
king
so
long
as
he
retained
his
reason
was
a
leading
actor
in
the
scandalous
masquerades
of
the
court
and
narrowly
escaped
losing
his
life
on
one
occasion
when
he
disguised
himself
as
a
devil
and
danced
immodestly
before
the
ladies
of
the
court
round
his
loins
as
round
those
of
his
a
sort
of
girdle
of
tow
had
been
fastened
and
all
the
masqueraders
were
chained
together
in
the
midst
of
their
dances
some
foolish
person
threw
a
lighted
torch
at
them
their
girdles
took
fire
and
all
were
burned
to
death
except
the
king
whom
the
duchess
of
berri
saved
by
courageously
raising
her
skirts
and
throwing
them
over
the
burning
monarch
charles
had
had
many
mistresses
in
his
youth
when
he
went
mad
the
physicians
directed
the
queen
to
refuse
to
discharge
her
conjugal
duty
charles
had
enough
of
his
former
nature
left
to
resent
this
privation
he
even
employed
force
and
succeeded
at
last
in
compelling
his
wife
to
resume
her
place
in
the
royal
couch
she
contrived
however
to
defraud
him
by
hiring
a
pretty
girl
to
take
her
place
it
is
said
charles
never
detected
the
fraud
his
wife
meanwhile
gave
the
reins
to
her
loose
passions
and
was
known
to
have
had
at
least
a
score
of
lovers
a
very
striking
picture
of
the
manners
of
the
time
is
afforded
by
the
story
of
agnes
sorel
she
was
as
is
known
the
mistress
of
charles
a
lady
of
good
family
and
otherwise
than
as
the
king
mistress
of
spotless
reputation
her
influence
over
the
king
she
used
for
the
best
of
purposes
it
was
she
who
roused
him
to
make
the
efforts
which
eventually
expelled
the
foreigner
from
france
her
private
character
was
laudable
she
was
amiable
generous
kind
and
true
yet
when
she
visited
paris
in
company
with
the
king
the
crowd
followed
her
whenever
she
appeared
in
the
streets
insulting
her
and
calling
her
a
prostitute
in
the
grossest
terms
the
king
lived
with
her
eighteen
years
but
never
ventured
to
acknowledge
her
publicly
as
his
mistress
of
the
four
daughters
she
bore
him
three
only
were
legitimated
by
his
successor
louis
xi
had
a
seraglio
and
a
colony
of
bastards
before
he
became
king
nor
did
he
alter
his
mode
of
life
when
he
assumed
control
of
the
kingdom
his
favorites
were
usually
chosen
from
the
lowest
class
of
his
subjects
many
of
whom
had
gone
through
an
apprenticeship
for
the
king
service
in
the
houses
of
prostitution
of
the
capital
louis
never
pretended
to
bear
them
any
affection
he
used
them
as
he
used
the
men
of
letters
who
composed
for
his
diversion
the
lewd
tales
which
have
reached
us
charles
viii
appears
to
have
been
more
virtuous
than
his
predecessors
though
of
course
he
did
not
pique
himself
upon
any
conjugal
fidelity
a
story
is
told
which
reflects
credit
upon
his
character
it
is
said
that
during
his
campaign
in
italy
when
he
retired
to
his
chamber
one
evening
he
found
there
a
young
girl
of
marvelous
beauty
in
a
state
of
complete
déshabillé
she
was
kneeling
and
in
tears
when
the
king
entered
on
charles
inquiring
the
cause
of
her
sorrow
she
confessed
that
her
parents
had
sold
her
to
the
king
valet
for
the
use
of
his
majesty
and
conjured
charles
to
spare
her
the
king
was
touched
by
her
distress
he
inquired
into
the
facts
and
finding
that
they
were
as
she
stated
and
farther
that
she
was
betrothed
to
a
youth
of
the
neighborhood
he
sent
for
him
and
married
the
young
couple
forthwith
it
appears
certain
that
charles
death
was
caused
by
his
indiscreet
commerce
with
the
sex
all
the
chroniclers
state
that
he
fell
a
victim
to
the
indulgence
of
his
passions
being
frail
of
body
and
of
feeble
constitution
the
court
of
louis
xii
was
purer
than
that
of
his
predecessors
owing
to
the
austere
virtue
of
the
queen
louis
himself
had
shared
the
profligacies
of
his
family
in
his
youth
but
on
becoming
king
he
allowed
his
wife
to
regulate
his
household
according
to
her
principles
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
say
the
old
chroniclers
prostitution
was
banished
from
court
we
shall
have
something
to
say
of
francis
in
connection
with
syphilis
of
which
he
was
a
conspicuous
and
an
early
victim
at
the
age
of
eighteen
his
mother
stated
that
he
had
been
punished
where
he
sinned
the
misfortune
did
not
operate
as
a
warning
his
life
was
notoriously
dissolute
at
a
time
when
profligacy
was
so
much
the
rule
that
it
was
hardly
likely
to
be
noticed
brantome
asserts
positively
that
his
expedition
to
italy
was
prompted
by
the
desire
to
make
acquaintance
with
a
courtesan
of
milan
whose
charms
admiral
bonnivet
had
extolled
previous
to
his
time
it
seems
there
had
always
been
attached
to
the
court
a
body
of
prostitutes
for
the
use
of
the
courtiers
francis
suppressed
this
body
and
actually
invited
the
ladies
of
the
court
to
take
their
place
brantome
reviews
this
policy
and
while
he
praises
it
in
view
of
the
joyous
pastimes
to
which
it
led
he
is
bound
to
acknowledge
that
it
produced
the
greatest
immorality
ever
known
in
france
the
ladies
of
the
town
followed
the
example
of
those
of
the
court
and
but
little
was
wanting
but
that
every
woman
in
france
became
a
prostitute
it
was
the
custom
during
this
reign
for
the
king
to
invite
all
his
courtiers
and
their
wives
and
daughters
to
lodge
at
the
royal
palaces
from
time
to
time
the
ladies
had
apartments
by
themselves
and
to
each
room
the
king
had
a
key
we
are
assured
that
the
husbands
fathers
and
brothers
of
ladies
who
refused
to
submit
to
the
royal
demands
had
but
little
chance
of
retaining
their
offices
if
they
had
been
guilty
of
maladministration
or
peculation
as
was
the
case
with
most
of
them
they
could
hope
for
pardon
only
through
the
complaisance
of
their
female
relatives
the
story
of
de
vallier
who
was
reprieved
on
the
scaffold
in
payment
for
the
favors
which
his
daughter
the
beautiful
diana
of
poictiers
had
granted
to
the
king
is
too
well
known
to
need
repetition
here
it
was
the
boast
of
francis
that
he
had
always
respected
the
honor
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
and
the
boast
was
just
from
his
point
of
view
his
visits
to
his
mistresses
were
always
made
in
a
mysterious
manner
and
at
night
even
to
the
duchess
of
etampes
who
was
his
acknowledged
mistress
and
procuress
for
a
period
of
nearly
twenty
years
he
never
behaved
in
public
in
a
manner
to
compromise
her
reputation
in
private
he
was
not
so
scrupulous
when
this
lady
husband
disturbed
the
king
one
evening
francis
drew
his
sword
on
him
and
threatened
to
kill
him
instantly
if
he
dared
to
reveal
what
every
one
knew
or
to
punish
the
wife
at
whose
adultery
he
had
connived
for
years
his
idea
seems
to
have
been
that
words
alone
constituted
the
sin
of
debauchery
on
one
occasion
he
took
all
the
ladies
of
the
court
to
see
the
royal
deer
in
the
rutting
season
but
when
a
gentleman
ventured
a
very
obvious
pleasantry
on
the
scene
he
exiled
him
from
court
for
life
his
death
has
been
frequently
described
some
writers
imply
by
their
silence
doubts
of
the
authenticity
of
the
story
of
belle
but
it
rests
on
very
tolerable
evidence
this
lady
who
was
uncommonly
beautiful
was
the
wife
of
a
lawyer
or
a
merchant
the
authorities
do
not
agree
on
the
point
the
king
solicited
her
favors
but
strange
to
say
was
met
with
a
positive
refusal
on
consultation
with
the
court
lawyers
however
francis
was
informed
that
he
could
by
the
exercise
of
his
royal
prerogative
enjoy
the
company
of
any
woman
he
pleased
and
the
ferronnière
was
accordingly
notified
that
the
king
commanded
her
to
yield
to
his
desires
she
confided
the
order
to
her
husband
who
on
reflection
counseled
her
to
submit
meanwhile
ferronnière
himself
used
his
best
endeavors
to
catch
a
syphilitic
disease
which
he
communicated
to
his
wife
she
gave
it
to
the
king
who
died
of
it
after
much
suffering
henry
ii
had
the
merit
of
fidelity
not
to
his
wife
but
to
his
mistress
the
latter
was
the
famous
diana
de
poictiers
whose
successful
intercession
with
francis
on
her
father
behalf
has
been
already
noticed
brantome
asserts
that
she
did
not
emulate
the
constancy
of
her
royal
lover
saying
that
in
her
youth
she
had
obliged
many
persons
he
tells
a
story
which
if
true
reflects
credit
on
the
temper
of
the
king
visiting
his
mistress
one
day
he
surprised
her
in
the
company
of
a
courtier
named
brissac
who
had
only
time
to
hide
himself
under
the
bed
after
spending
some
moments
with
diana
the
king
asked
for
some
refreshments
some
boxes
of
confectionery
were
brought
him
and
in
the
midst
of
his
meal
he
took
a
box
and
threw
it
under
the
bed
saying
halloo
brissac
every
body
must
live
diana
lost
no
portion
of
her
lover
heart
in
consequence
of
her
infidelities
this
she
owed
in
some
degree
to
her
extraordinary
beauty
which
she
preserved
so
late
in
life
that
it
was
commonly
reported
she
was
in
the
habit
of
using
soap
made
of
liquid
gold
henry
was
proud
of
his
mistress
and
never
concealed
their
liaison
he
had
his
arms
interwoven
with
hers
on
many
public
buildings
and
pieces
of
plate
he
used
constantly
to
ride
through
the
streets
with
the
beautiful
diana
on
his
crupper
and
he
showed
her
so
marked
a
preference
over
his
wife
that
judicious
courtiers
never
made
the
mistake
of
courting
the
latter
but
the
orderly
life
of
the
king
was
not
imitated
by
the
court
according
to
brantome
and
sauval
the
excesses
of
the
age
of
francis
were
aggravated
under
henry
it
was
rare
says
the
former
that
ladies
presented
their
virginity
to
their
husbands
and
husbands
who
objected
to
the
intimacy
of
their
wives
with
kings
princes
noblemen
and
others
of
the
court
were
eschewed
from
society
a
woman
was
held
to
be
virtuous
because
she
begged
her
lover
to
wait
till
she
was
married
to
gratify
his
desires
married
women
who
retained
their
love
for
the
same
for
several
years
were
considered
models
of
purity
brantome
intimates
distinctly
that
ordinary
debauchery
fell
short
of
the
desires
of
the
courtiers
incest
sodomy
and
similar
enormities
could
alone
satiate
the
passions
of
the
old
debauchees
of
the
day
the
same
writer
partially
explains
the
spread
of
vice
by
saying
that
within
the
last
half
century
the
ladies
of
france
had
acquired
the
arts
of
italy
nor
is
it
doubtful
that
with
the
medicis
many
of
the
monstrous
vices
which
have
been
peculiar
to
italy
ever
since
the
age
of
imperial
rome
were
imported
into
france
we
hear
of
all
kinds
of
instruments
of
debauchery
of
lewd
books
and
lewd
pictures
of
indecent
sculptures
and
bronzes
being
sold
without
let
or
hinderance
in
the
stores
of
paris
it
was
the
age
of
aretino
and
besides
that
famous
or
infamous
writer
a
number
of
other
italians
had
competed
for
the
prize
of
lewdness
in
composition
poets
painters
sculptors
seemed
to
try
how
far
art
could
be
prostituted
cellini
leonardo
da
vinci
giulio
romano
nicollo
abate
and
indeed
almost
all
their
contemporaries
debased
their
genius
by
the
execution
of
indecent
works
many
of
these
found
their
way
to
paris
when
pope
clement
vii
undertook
to
prosecute
the
authors
of
indecent
works
whether
in
letters
or
art
most
of
the
compositions
that
were
endangered
by
his
bull
were
transported
to
france
brantome
alludes
to
many
of
them
as
being
quite
common
in
his
time
he
describes
for
instance
a
silver
goblet
on
which
the
most
indecent
scenes
were
graven
and
which
a
nobleman
of
the
court
always
obliged
the
ladies
who
visited
him
to
use
at
table
other
noblemen
had
their
rooms
painted
in
fresco
in
similar
taste
it
is
stated
that
anne
of
austria
caused
three
hundred
thousand
écus
worth
of
frescoes
of
this
kind
to
be
removed
from
the
ceilings
of
the
palace
at
fontainebleau
but
in
the
reign
of
henry
ii
it
does
not
appear
that
any
one
was
ever
prosecuted
for
dealing
in
this
kind
of
merchandise
during
the
three
following
reigns
it
was
catharine
of
medicis
who
gave
the
tone
to
the
court
and
really
ruled
the
kingdom
all
historians
concur
in
stating
that
she
used
prostitution
as
the
mainspring
of
her
policy
she
had
a
court
of
sometimes
two
to
three
hundred
ladies
of
honor
whom
she
employed
to
worm
out
the
secrets
of
the
politicians
of
the
day
they
were
known
as
the
queen
flying
squadron
and
it
appears
they
performed
their
duties
successfully
of
course
at
the
cost
of
whatever
virtue
or
decency
the
court
still
retained
brantome
is
still
our
authority
for
asserting
that
they
introduced
a
new
feature
of
debauchery
they
took
the
initiative
in
affairs
of
this
kind
and
instead
of
yielding
to
the
entreaties
of
lovers
it
was
they
who
pressed
their
lovers
to
meet
them
half
way
he
likewise
informs
us
that
they
aided
the
establishment
in
france
of
other
vices
which
had
hitherto
been
peculiar
to
southern
and
eastern
climates
by
the
revival
of
practices
which
had
been
common
among
the
of
athens
it
has
been
asserted
that
catharine
willfully
tutored
her
children
in
habits
of
debauchery
in
order
to
divert
their
minds
from
politics
and
retain
control
over
the
kingdom
but
this
scandal
does
not
appear
to
rest
on
authentic
evidence
it
is
unquestionable
however
that
charles
the
author
of
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
lived
in
incestuous
intercourse
with
his
sister
margaret
and
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
the
story
that
catharine
more
than
once
entertained
the
king
and
court
at
a
banquet
at
which
nude
females
served
as
waiters
perhaps
the
best
idea
of
the
morals
of
the
time
can
be
obtained
from
the
adventures
of
the
margaret
just
mentioned
who
married
henry
king
of
navarre
and
afterward
king
of
france
it
is
said
that
at
the
age
of
eleven
she
had
two
lovers
both
of
whom
claimed
to
have
robbed
her
of
her
virtue
marrying
the
king
of
navarre
she
found
means
to
leave
her
husband
and
reside
at
paris
whose
air
suited
her
better
than
the
country
here
her
debaucheries
were
a
common
theme
of
scandal
her
lovers
being
counted
by
the
score
happening
at
last
to
give
birth
to
a
child
which
mysteriously
disappeared
her
brother
henry
iii
sent
her
to
her
husband
in
a
henry
of
navarre
refused
to
cohabit
with
her
the
king
vainly
endeavored
to
reconcile
the
couple
with
more
zeal
than
tact
he
used
as
an
argument
with
his
cousin
that
the
mother
of
the
king
of
navarre
had
not
herself
led
an
irreproachable
life
at
this
henry
burst
into
a
laugh
and
remarked
to
the
envoy
that
the
king
was
very
complimentary
in
his
letters
his
majesty
having
in
the
first
described
the
vices
of
the
wife
and
in
the
second
alluded
to
the
frailties
of
the
mother
he
persisted
in
refusing
to
receive
margaret
and
she
took
refuge
in
the
little
town
of
agen
but
no
sooner
began
to
lead
her
usual
life
there
than
the
people
rose
and
expelled
her
she
found
a
second
refuge
in
the
fortress
of
usson
and
there
she
lived
twenty
years
in
a
sort
of
prison
which
she
converted
into
a
brothel
she
was
debarred
from
the
society
of
men
of
fashion
and
courtiers
but
for
her
purposes
servants
secretaries
musicians
and
even
the
peasants
of
the
neighborhood
answered
as
well
and
of
these
there
was
no
lack
returning
to
paris
in
her
old
age
she
did
not
alter
her
course
of
life
she
became
outwardly
devout
and
established
a
nunnery
and
monastery
near
her
hotel
the
latter
the
people
said
in
order
to
have
monks
always
at
hand
but
the
list
of
her
lovers
remained
undiminished
to
the
very
verge
of
her
death
nor
did
her
husband
present
any
striking
contrast
to
his
wife
though
he
reflected
so
severely
upon
her
in
the
work
published
under
the
title
divorce
bayle
remarks
that
had
he
not
expended
so
large
a
portion
of
his
energy
in
the
pursuit
of
sensual
pleasures
he
would
have
been
one
of
the
greatest
heroes
of
history
he
was
profuse
and
indiscriminate
in
his
attachments
duchess
or
farmer
daughter
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
he
changed
his
mistress
once
a
month
at
least
as
an
exception
to
this
rule
his
affection
for
gabrielle
a
very
lovely
creature
whom
he
shared
with
the
marquis
of
bellegarde
and
who
bore
him
or
them
three
children
lasted
several
years
he
was
not
faithful
to
her
and
made
no
secret
of
his
infidelities
but
he
loved
her
passionately
on
one
occasion
he
left
his
army
in
the
midst
of
a
campaign
disguised
himself
as
a
peasant
and
traveled
through
the
enemy
country
to
meet
her
he
once
went
to
see
her
but
was
stopped
at
the
door
with
the
announcement
that
bellegarde
was
with
her
his
first
impulse
was
one
of
rage
drawing
his
sword
he
rushed
toward
the
door
but
stopped
half
way
and
saying
no
it
would
make
her
angry
he
returned
home
gabrielle
was
a
very
beautiful
and
charming
person
she
was
in
the
habit
of
having
herself
painted
in
a
state
of
perfect
nudity
with
her
children
playing
around
her
when
she
died
henry
proposed
to
replace
her
by
mademoiselle
whose
beauty
had
made
some
sensation
at
court
negotiations
were
opened
with
the
lady
who
dutifully
placed
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
her
family
and
father
mother
and
brothers
began
to
treat
with
the
king
for
the
prostitution
of
their
daughter
and
sister
they
asked
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
the
king
thought
the
sum
large
and
offered
fifty
thousand
but
the
family
refusing
to
give
way
he
acceded
to
their
demands
they
then
added
that
they
would
like
to
have
a
promise
of
marriage
conditioned
upon
the
lady
bearing
a
male
child
within
a
year
to
this
likewise
henry
agreed
in
spite
of
sully
remonstrances
and
mdlle
became
the
acknowledged
mistress
of
the
king
it
need
not
be
added
that
the
promise
of
marriage
was
never
fulfilled
some
time
afterward
henry
fell
in
love
with
a
young
lady
who
was
betrothed
to
marshal
bassompierre
as
ardent
as
ever
he
sent
for
the
marshal
explained
his
feelings
and
ordered
bassompierre
to
renounce
his
claims
the
marshal
obeyed
and
henry
married
the
lady
who
was
a
montmorency
to
the
prince
of
condé
the
marriage
was
hardly
over
before
the
king
opened
negotiations
with
the
bride
it
will
be
scarcely
credited
that
the
emissary
he
employed
was
the
mother
of
the
prince
of
condé
who
left
no
means
untried
to
effect
the
dishonor
of
her
son
the
prince
of
less
complacent
temper
than
most
other
courtiers
refused
to
allow
his
wife
to
become
the
king
mistress
he
removed
her
from
france
and
just
as
henry
was
about
to
send
after
her
the
assassin
ravaillac
freed
condé
from
the
danger
the
disorders
of
henry
the
predecessor
of
the
king
of
navarre
are
shamefully
notorious
there
was
a
time
during
his
reign
when
for
the
same
reason
which
induced
the
establishment
of
at
athens
prostitution
almost
seemed
a
desirable
institution
at
paris
in
his
youth
he
had
been
a
famous
seducer
of
the
ladies
of
honor
an
anecdote
of
his
life
at
this
period
not
only
reveals
the
tone
of
the
court
but
happily
shows
that
depravity
was
not
so
universal
as
might
be
imagined
when
henry
was
chosen
king
of
poland
he
was
anxious
to
settle
his
mistress
mdlle
de
chateauneuf
by
finding
her
a
husband
he
applied
to
a
courtier
the
provost
of
paris
de
nantonillet
but
received
the
scathing
reply
that
de
nantonillet
would
not
marry
a
prostitute
till
the
king
had
established
brothels
in
the
louvre
it
is
best
perhaps
to
throw
a
veil
over
the
later
stories
of
henry
his
and
the
frightful
infamies
that
were
practiced
in
paris
in
his
time
they
may
be
divined
from
the
fact
that
brantome
mentions
some
orgies
in
which
the
king
and
a
party
of
friends
male
and
female
stripped
themselves
naked
and
tried
to
place
themselves
on
a
level
with
the
brute
creation
as
rather
redeeming
instances
of
his
sensuality
we
shall
take
occasion
hereafter
to
follow
the
history
of
the
court
from
louis
xiii
to
modern
times
meanwhile
some
features
of
society
bearing
on
prostitution
in
the
age
we
have
sketched
must
be
briefly
noted
it
is
asserted
by
all
the
chroniclers
that
the
influence
of
the
league
was
most
pernicious
a
sort
of
religious
enthusiasm
seems
to
have
been
kindled
by
the
sectarian
strife
of
the
period
and
practices
which
purported
to
be
religious
but
were
only
immoral
were
encouraged
by
the
highest
authorities
religious
fanaticism
ruled
throughout
france
men
and
women
walked
naked
in
processions
which
were
led
by
the
curates
as
was
natural
at
an
age
of
civil
war
violence
was
freely
used
toward
females
by
both
of
the
contending
armies
at
every
city
that
was
taken
either
by
the
leaguers
or
the
huguenots
all
the
women
married
and
single
were
violated
by
the
soldiery
such
at
least
is
the
statement
of
a
contemporary
historian
moreover
in
the
general
confusion
no
proper
police
was
enforced
either
at
paris
or
elsewhere
and
the
windows
of
teemed
with
lewd
pictures
which
no
one
says
the
historian
thought
of
having
seized
it
was
in
fact
a
period
of
anarchy
the
de
by
beroalde
de
venille
which
has
reached
us
affords
some
criterion
of
the
popular
literature
of
the
day
aretino
text
and
plates
was
much
in
vogue
and
sanchez
and
benedicti
left
their
lay
rivals
far
behind
in
the
composition
of
works
which
may
contend
for
the
palm
of
lewdness
with
martial
or
petronius
throughout
the
middle
ages
and
indeed
up
to
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
great
complaint
was
made
by
the
clergy
of
the
indecency
of
the
dress
of
the
people
of
france
about
the
thirteenth
century
it
became
fashionable
to
adorn
the
toe
of
the
shoe
or
boot
with
an
ornament
in
metal
either
a
lion
claw
or
an
eagle
beak
or
something
of
that
kind
some
immodest
person
ventured
to
substitute
a
sexual
image
in
bronze
for
the
usual
appendage
and
the
fashion
soon
became
general
women
even
adopted
it
and
all
the
best
society
of
paris
soon
exhibited
the
indecency
on
their
feet
the
king
forbade
their
use
by
royal
edicts
and
a
special
bull
was
fulminated
against
them
by
pope
urban
but
the
monstrous
shoes
held
their
ground
against
both
and
were
only
disused
when
fashion
set
in
a
different
direction
the
was
another
enormity
of
the
same
character
originally
it
is
said
the
invented
the
idea
of
a
small
bag
hanging
between
the
knees
in
which
a
knife
or
other
utensil
could
be
carried
the
fashion
was
adopted
about
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
by
men
of
rank
and
became
immediately
of
an
immodest
nature
all
the
arts
of
fashion
were
called
into
requisition
to
give
the
the
most
novel
and
remarkable
appearance
and
every
possible
means
was
used
to
render
them
at
once
disgustingly
indecent
and
extravagantly
rich
they
were
attached
to
the
dress
with
ribbons
and
when
the
wearer
was
a
rich
man
were
adorned
with
jewels
and
lace
at
the
time
montaigne
wrote
had
almost
gone
out
of
vogue
they
were
worn
only
by
old
men
who
in
the
language
of
the
essayist
make
public
parade
of
what
can
not
decently
be
mentioned
women
on
their
side
invented
hoops
bustles
and
dresses
the
libraries
contain
a
large
collection
of
works
written
by
moralists
and
preachers
of
the
time
against
these
indecent
abuses
of
the
ladies
as
they
are
all
in
use
at
the
present
time
we
may
perhaps
conclude
that
the
old
french
moralists
were
unnecessarily
alarmed
but
it
is
likely
that
the
form
of
the
bustle
was
by
no
means
as
modest
as
that
of
modern
crinoline
skirts
and
that
the
fashion
of
ladies
drawers
had
not
yet
come
in
such
at
least
is
the
inference
from
some
of
the
criticisms
they
provoked
the
exposure
of
the
breasts
was
checked
for
a
time
under
louis
but
the
reform
was
evanescent
and
the
custom
against
which
churchmen
thundered
in
the
sixteenth
century
survives
some
allusion
has
already
been
made
to
the
theatre
theatricals
were
forbidden
by
the
early
french
kings
at
the
instigation
of
the
church
but
the
prohibition
was
evaded
by
the
performance
of
scenes
from
the
gospel
dramatized
from
the
remains
of
these
moralities
it
would
appear
that
they
were
always
coarse
and
often
immoral
the
devil
always
played
a
prominent
part
and
would
have
been
inconsistent
had
he
not
outraged
decency
under
henry
iii
women
began
to
appear
on
the
stage
and
farces
very
broad
in
ideas
and
language
began
to
be
played
instead
of
the
old
moralities
we
are
led
to
believe
that
nothing
was
too
scandalous
to
be
represented
on
the
stage
in
fact
the
idea
seems
to
have
been
to
crowd
as
much
sensuality
and
vice
into
the
farces
as
possible
scarcely
any
incident
of
life
was
too
indecent
to
be
either
portrayed
or
described
and
if
the
latter
the
description
was
given
in
the
most
undisguised
language
it
is
altogether
impossible
to
transcribe
scenes
of
this
nature
enough
to
say
that
women
were
made
to
go
through
the
pains
of
childbirth
on
the
stage
husband
and
wife
went
to
bed
in
presence
of
the
public
and
when
modesty
prompted
the
retirement
of
actors
for
causes
still
more
indecent
a
colleague
rarely
failed
to
explain
why
they
had
retired
and
what
they
were
doing
behind
the
curtain
many
of
la
fontaine
most
stories
were
taken
from
farces
which
were
once
acted
with
copious
pantomime
before
the
ladies
of
paris
even
as
late
as
the
reign
of
henry
plays
of
this
character
were
commonly
acted
at
paris
at
the
hotel
de
bourgogne
it
was
usual
for
the
star
actor
to
speak
a
prologue
or
an
interlude
which
was
invariably
recommended
by
its
indecency
we
have
some
of
the
titles
of
these
prologues
and
they
were
generally
of
the
same
character
as
the
one
on
the
question
vir
an

se
magis
delectet
in
of
the
number
of
regular
prostitutes
exercising
their
calling
in
france
during
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
no
correct
estimate
can
be
made
it
was
undoubtedly
large
during
the
religious
wars
a
writer
on
the
side
of
protestantism
undertook
to
draw
up
a
statement
of
the
number
of
prostitutes
and
lewd
women
whose
vices
were
chargeable
to
the
clergy
his
estimate
is
of
course
open
to
suspicion
as
being
a
sectarian
performance
but
allowing
for
great
exaggeration
it
will
still
appear
alarming
he
calculates
that
there
were
at
that
time
one
million
of
women
more
or
less
who
led
habitually
lewd
lives
and
ministered
to
the
passions
of
the
clergy
these
were
independent
of
the
married
women
who
were
led
into
adultery
and
of
the
pimps
and
procuresses
who
were
in
clerical
pay
to
return
to
the
laws
regulating
prostitution
it
appears
that
a
serious
effort
was
made
to
put
it
down
under
the
sovereignty
of
catharine
of
medicis
an
ordinance
of
charles
dated
prohibited
the
opening
or
keeping
of
any
brothel
or
house
of
reception
for
prostitutes
in
paris
for
a
short
period
it
seems
that
the
practice
was
actually
suppressed
and
the
consequence
is
said
to
have
been
a
large
increase
of
secret
debauchery
a
few
years
after
the
passage
of
the
ordinance
a
huguenot
clergyman
named
cayet
proposed
to
public
brothels
in
the
interest
of
the
public
morals
but
the
authorities
of
his
church
assailed
him
so
vehemently
that
his
scheme
fell
to
the
ground
without
having
had
the
benefit
of
a
public
discussion
and
he
was
himself
driven
to
join
the
romanists
in
an
ordinance
of
henry
iii
reaffirmed
the
ordinance
of
and
alleged
that
the
magistrates
of
the
city
had
connived
at
the
establishment
of
brothels
ordinances
of
the
provost
followed
in
the
same
strain
and
all
prostitutes
were
required
to
leave
paris
within
hours
an
ordinance
dated
was
still
more
rigorous
it
condemned
all
men
concerned
in
the
traffic
of
prostitution
to
the
galleys
for
life
and
all
women
and
girls
to
be
whipped
shaved
and
banished
for
life
without
any
formal
trial
as
might
be
imagined
this
ordinance
was
alternately
disregarded
and
made
to
serve
the
purposes
of
private
malice
men
who
wished
to
revenge
themselves
on
their
mistresses
accused
them
of
being
prostitutes
but
does
not
appear
that
the
actual
supply
was
ever

subsequent

novels

we
have
thus
sketched
the
history
of
prostitution
in
france
from
the
commencement
of
the
french
nation
to
the
reign
of
louis
xiii
this
chapter
will
complete
the
subject
to
the
present
day
the
ordinance
of
prohibiting
prostitution
in
any
shape
and
granting
hours
only
to
prostitutes
and
their
accomplices
to
evacuate
paris
remained
in
force
till
late
in
the
eighteenth
century
though
so
far
as
the
general
traffic
went
it
was
a
dead
letter
it
enabled
the
police
authorities
to
imprison
or
exile
unruly
prostitutes
from
time
to
time
and
was
the
basis
of
the
measure
by
which
the
colonists
of
canada
were
first
supplied
with
wives
direct
from
the
paris
stews
it
also
enabled
noblemen
and
officials
connected
with
government
to
avenge
themselves
upon
unfaithful
mistresses
and
to
exercise
a
convenient
sort
of
tyranny
over
the
pretty
and
of
the
metropolis
in
louis
xiv
made
some
alteration
in
the
laws
governing
prostitution
he
provided
prisons
for
the
detention
of
prostitutes
and
armed
the
lieutenant
of
police
with
authority
to
correct
them
and
he
drew
a
broad
line
of
distinction
between
dissolute
women
who
were
not
actually
upon
the
town
and
the
class
of
prostitutes
proper
a
farther
police
regulation
on
the
subject
was
made
in
by
that
measure
a
sort
of
regularity
was
introduced
into
the
procedure
against
courtesans
and
lewd
women
they
were
definitely
divided
into
two
classes
women
who
led
dissolute
lives
without
being
precisely
prostitutes
and
prostitutes
proper
the
police
were
authorized
to
interfere
against
both
on
complaint
of
any
person
who
charged
them
with
outraging
public
decency
in
the
case
of
prostitutes
the
proceeding
was
summary
the
culprit
was
summoned
condemned
on
slight
evidence
and
sentenced
either
to
exile
imprisonment
or
more
rarely
to
a
whipping
or
the
loss
of
her
hair
with
regard
to
dissolute
women
who
were
not
regular
prostitutes
the
authorities
proceeded
more
cautiously
they
were
entitled
to
all
the
privileges
of
other
accused
persons
sentences
rendered
against
them
being
subject
to
appeal
and
when
found
guilty
the
penalty
inflicted
was
usually
a
fine
occasionally
the
houses
where
they
had
carried
on
their
calling
were
closed
the
furniture
was
thrown
out
of
the
window
and
a
crier
proclaimed
their
disgrace
throughout
the
city
monsieur
who
had
the
patience
to
read
all
the
records
of
proceedings
against
prostitutes
in
the
city
of
paris
from
to
the
law
from
these
instances
of
its
application
and
concludes
that
notwithstanding
the
ordinance
of
brothels
were
licensed
by
the
police
that
prostitutes
were
never
troubled
except
on
complaint
of
a
responsible
person
that
brothels
were
disorderly
that
riots
rows
and
murders
not
unfrequently
occurred
within
their
walls
or
in
their
neighborhood
that
the
punishment
was
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
magistrate
that
the
penalties
inflicted
were
lighter
toward
the
close
of
the
period
examined
that
certain
streets
in
paris
were
wholly
occupied
by
prostitutes
probably
with
a
view
to
enlarge
the
discretion
of
the
magistrates
a
new
ordinance
was
passed
in
renewing
in
peremptory
language
the
prohibitive
provisions
of
the
enactment
of
this
ordinance
which
bears
the
name
and
probably
emanated
from
the
office
of
lenoir
the
police
magistrate
declares
that
no
public
woman
shall
hereafter
try
to
catch
men
on
the
wharves
or
boulevards
or
in
the
streets
or
squares
of
paris
under
penalty
of
being
shaved
whipped
and
imprisoned
that
no
householder
shall
let
his
house
or
any
part
thereof
to
prostitutes
under
penalty
of
five
hundred
francs
fine
and
that
keepers
shall
allow
no
men
and
women
to
sleep
together
without
seeing
their
marriage
contract
the
most
curious
feature
in
connection
with
this
ordinance
was
the
fact
that
it
was
not
intended
or
held
to
interfere
with
established
brothels
which
the
government
continued
to
license
as
before
it
was
intended
to
affect
private
prostitutes
only
we
may
judge
of
its
success
from
the
general
statement
that
soon
after
its
passage
the
streets
and
squares
were
thronged
with
prostitutes
no
woman
or
modest
person
could
walk
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
at
night
lewd
women
showed
themselves
at
their
windows
in
a
state
of
nudity
and
shocked
public
decency
still
more
glaringly
by
their
postures
in
the
streets
it
was
in
fact
so
complete
a
failure
that
two
years
after
its
establishment
it
was
practically
repealed
by
a
new
police
regulation
in
the
whole
body
of
the
legislation
of
the
monarchy
was
abolished
and
in
its
stead
the
republican
legislature
enacted
a
code
which
was
the
only
law
in
force
in
france
that
code
making
no
reference
to
prostitution
it
was
inferred
by
lawyers
that
women
had
a
natural
right
to
prostitute
their
bodies
if
they
chose
and
accordingly
the
traffic
became
open
and
free
the
consequence
of
this
was
a
tremendous
development
of
the
vice
prostitutes
established
themselves
in
every
street
and
monopolized
every
public
place
paris
became
scarcely
habitable
for
modest
women
an
outcry
against
this
monstrous
state
of
things
reached
the
executive
directory
in
and
that
body
sent
a
message
to
the
council
of
five
hundred
begging
them
to
legislate
on
the
subject
the
message
was
clear
and
able
calling
upon
the
council
to
define
prostitute
and
suggesting
that
reiterated
offenses
legally
proved
public
notoriety
or
arrest
in
the
act
appeared
to
constitute
proof
of
prostitution
it
seemed
to
call
for
penalties
in
the
shape
of
imprisonment
on
women
exercising
this
calling
but
neither
this
suggestion
nor
a
subsequent
project
of
the
same
character
was
ever
carried
into
effect
napoleon
swept
the
palais
royal
of
the
prostitutes
who
had
made
it
their
and
broke
up
some
of
the
greatest
brothels
by
harassing
their
inmates
in
various
ways
but
he
made
no
law
on
the
subject
in
pasquier
prefect
of
police
drafted
a
bill
for
the
regulation
of
prostitutes
but
it
never
went
into
effect
and
the
imperial
ordinance
drawn
by
the
prefect
has
been
lost
five
years
later
anglis
prefect
of
police
under
louis
attempted
the
same
thing
with
no
better
success
the
law
officers
of
the
crown
seeming
to
have
supposed
that
the
general
provisions
of
the
articles
of
the
code
on
public
decency
and
outrages
upon
public
morality
covered
the
particular
case
of
prostitution
the
last
efforts
that
were
made
in
france
to
obtain
a
law
for
the
regulation
of
prostitution
were
in
and
when
the
ministry
seriously
thought
of
settling
the
whole
matter
by
a
royal
declaration
these
endeavors
had
the
same
fate
as
the
former
ones
leading
to
no
result
a
general
impression
has
prevailed
of
late
years
that
the
moral
sense
of
the
public
would
be
shocked
by
any
legislative
act
licensing
so
great
a
sin
as
prostitution
and
as
the
government
has
assumed
without
constitutional
warrant
the
control
and
regulation
of
prostitutes
and
has
exercised
as
full
authority
as
it
could
have
done
had
there
been
a
law
on
the
subject
the
deficiency
has
hardly
been
felt
a
conscientious
official
has
occasionally
experienced
qualms
of
conscience
at
acting
without
legal
warrant
the
government
has
sometimes
been
frightened
by
a
menace
of
resistance
from
some
bold
lawyer
but
no
trouble
has
ever
actually
arisen
and
custom
now
gives
to
the
police
regulations
the
force
of
law
we
shall
review
these
regulations
in
another
place
meanwhile
a
glance
must
be
cast
upon
the
progress
of
morality
in
france
during
the
seventeenth
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
the
gallantry
which
distinguished
the
court
of
henry
iv
became
more
refined
though
not
less
criminal
under
louis
xiii
adultery
and
seduction
were
matters
in
the
circles
which
educated
mary
queen
of
scots
and
developed
the
wit
of
the
author
of
grammont
memoirs
every
lady
was
presumed
to
have
a
lover
every
man
of
fashion
more
than
one
mistress
richelieu
boasted
that
no
lady
could
reject
him
when
he
chose
to
throw
the
handkerchief
and
mazarin
was
accused
of
intrigues
with
the
queen
herself
louis
did
not
blush
to
visit
his
mistresses
at
the
head
of
his
guards
and
in
all
the
pomp
of
royalty
and
as
an
instance
of
their
influence
over
him
it
has
been
stated
that
it
was
at
the
request
of
mademoiselle
de
la
fayette
that
he
consented
to
visit
his
wife
nine
months
before
the
birth
of
louis
xiv
a
race
of
women
had
sprung
up
under
the
teaching
of
the
medicis
who
combined
political
skill
with
licentious
propensities
and
conducted
state
and
amorous
intrigues
with
equal
ardor
and
success
the
ladies
who
surrounded
anne
of
austria
and
mary
of
medicis
and
that
brilliant
circle
which
has
been
described
in
the
memoirs
of
madame
de
longueville
and
madame
de
sablé
were
undoubtedly
as
dissipated
as
they
were
refined
their
virtues
were
in
inverse
proportion
to
their
wit
paris
no
longer
witnessed
the
louvre
converted
into
a
royal
preserve
or
detestable
debauchees
haunting
its
dark
passages
but
there
reigned
throughout
the
court
an
air
of
polished
sensuality
which
in
point
of
fact
must
have
been
at
least
equally
prejudicial
to
good
morals
louis
xiv
imbibed
the
spirit
of
the
age
during
his
minority
royal
mistresses
had
become
a
recognized
institution
fathers
and
husbands
rather
courting
than
dreading
dishonor
at
the
hands
of
the
king
after
having
dispensed
his
favors
with
some
impartiality
among
the
ladies
of
the
court
he
discovered
apparently
to
his
surprise
that
one
of
them
a
charming
girl
named
louise
de
la
vallière
really
loved
him
the
only
person
who
showed
much
annoyance
at
the
warmth
with
which
the
king
entered
upon
this
new
liaison
was
the
duchess
of
orleans
henrietta
of
england
the
king
who
seems
to
have
expected
that
she
would
be
the
fortunate
recipient
of
whatever
crumbs
might
fall
from
the
royal
table
she
was
unable
however
to
divert
louis
from
his
purpose
la
vallière
became
his
mistress
and
bore
him
two
children
when
he
grew
tired
of
her
as
he
did
soon
after
the
birth
of
her
second
child
she
retired
into
a
convent
and
expiated
her
fault
by
thirty
years
austere
penitence
the
king
then
turned
his
attention
to
a
lady
of
noble
rank
the
wife
of
the
marquis
of
montespan
and
in
a
business
manner
exiled
the
marquis
to
his
estate
and
lived
with
his
wife
a
woman
otherwise
virtuous
proud
and
queenly
she
lived
with
the
king
for
fourteen
years
and
bore
him
eight
children
these
children
were
openly
legitimated
by
louis
and
were
married
by
him
to
members
of
the
royal
family
he
even
contemplated
securing
the
throne
to
them
though
they
were
thus
doubly
adulterine
the
last
mistress
of
louis
xiv
was
the
famous
madame
de
maintenon
the
widow
of
the
poet
scarron
a
person
of
remarkable
abilities
and
old
enough
to
have
recovered
from
the
passions
which
were
said
to
have
disturbed
her
youth
she
was
introduced
to
the
king
as
the
governess
of
his
illegitimate
children
and
by
her
arts
contrived
not
only
to
wean
the
king
heart
from
his
mistress
but
even
to
alienate
the
children
from
their
mother
for
years
she
wielded
supreme
control
over
louis
mind
and
whatever
may
be
said
of
her
early
life
and
however
harsh
a
judgment
must
be
formed
of
her
political
measures
it
must
be
allowed
that
in
general
her
influence
was
exercised
for
the
good
of
religion
and
morality
under
her
direction
the
court
became
positively
devout
intrigues
were
concealed
not
ostentatiously
paraded
before
the
public
eye
and
the
ladies
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
were
obliged
to
lead
at
least
outwardly
decorous
lives
she
might
not
be
able
to
check
the
monstrous
practices
of
the
duke
of
orleans
but
much
of
the
looseness
of
the
court
she
could
and
really
did
bring
to
an
end
her
royal
lover
who
at
first
piqued
himself
upon
rising
as
far
above
obligations
of
fidelity
to
his
mistresses
as
he
considered
himself
superior
to
political
obligations
to
his
people
resigned
himself
to
the
spiritual
direction
of
the
marquise
and
allowed
old
age
to
assert
its
rights
in
condemning
him
to
virtue
all
things
considered
the
last
twenty
years
of
louis
xiv
reign
was
perhaps
the
most
moral
in
the
whole
history
of
the
monarchy
this
is
well
illustrated
in
the
history
of
the
literature
of
the
day
the
leading
philosophers
writers
and
poets
of
the
age
of
louis
xiv
forbore
to
shock
decency
and
may
be
read
as
safely
as
any
modern
work
preachers
bossuet
massillon
bourdaloue
exercised
a
potent
influence
over
the
tone
of
letters
and
society
corneille
racine
and
their
contemporaries
provided
the
stage
with
a
repertory
that
could
never
bring
a
blush
to
the
cheek
even
molière
who
did
occasionally
let
slip
a
joke
of
questionable
propriety
for
the
pit
sake
seems
a
daring
innovator
when
he
is
contrasted
with
his
predecessors
decency
is
in
fact
one
of
the
most
striking
characteristics
of
the
literature
of
the
age
we
may
also
date
from
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
the
final
extinction
of
many
of
the
old
feudal
rights
which
were
at
war
with
morality
horrible
as
it
may
seem
there
were
parts
of
france
where
the
custom
allowed
the
seigneur
to
debauch
the
daughter
of
his
vassal
without
obstacle
or
penalty
in
some
provinces
it
is
said
to
have
been
customary
for
the
seigneur
to
enjoy
the
first
night
of
every
girl
married
within
his
manor
in
others
the
peculiar
authority
of
the
seigneur
over
the
serfs
who
were
attached
to
the
glebe
was
held
to
endow
him
with
the
right
of
using
the
bodies
of
their
wives
and
daughters
as
he
saw
fit
no
written
custom
justified
these
monstrous
privileges
but
frequent
allusions
to
them
in
the
old
french
writers
show
that
in
certain
parts
they
were
sanctioned
by
usage
louis
xiv
made
it
his
especial
business
to
break
down
the
privileges
of
the
nobility
and
it
was
no
doubt
to
the
general
police
regulations
he
made
for
the
government
of
the
kingdom
at
large
that
the
extinction
of
these
rights
was
mainly
due
with
the
regency
the
scene
changes
the
duke
of
orleans
had
long
been
one
of
the
most
depraved
men
in
france
so
long
as
louis
xiv
lived
he
had
perforce
observed
a
certain
outward
decorum
but
the
death
of
the
monarch
and
the
duke
seizure
of
the
regency
enabled
him
to
give
free
scope
to
his
propensities
he
resided
in
the
palais
royal
and
gave
suppers
there
almost
every
evening
to
a
select
circle
of
roués
and
fast
women
among
whom
madame
de
parabère
long
held
the
place
of
honor
the
company
not
unfrequently
varied
the
entertainment
by
the
performance
of
charades
and
tableaux
among
which
the
judgment
of
paris
was
a
favorite
of
the
regent
the
conversation
of
the
guests
was
so
gross
as
to
shock
all
but
the
initiated
and
when
they
separated
they
were
generally
all
intoxicated
the
most
startling
and
horrible
feature
of
these
entertainments
was
the
fact
that
the
regent
daughter
the
duchess
of
berri
was
almost
always
present
her
life
was
a
romance
married
while
a
child
to
the
due
de
berri
by
her
passionate
temper
and
her
levities
she
was
the
bane
of
her
husband
life
she
embraced
the
infidel
and
licentious
doctrines
of
the
age
in
company
with
her
father
and
the
pair
were
so
fond
of
each
other
that
the
most
horrible
suspicions
began
to
gain
ground
they
were
dispelled
for
a
time
by
the
discovery
of
an
intrigue
between
the
duchess
and
her
chamberlain
which
so
provoked
the
duke
that
he
seized
his
wife
by
the
hair
and
beat
her
on
his
death
which
occurred
soon
afterward
she
gave
the
reins
to
her
passion
and
set
an
example
of
scandal
at
the
luxembourg
where
she
had
apartments
she
exhibited
the
state
of
a
queen
and
lover
succeeded
lover
with
startling
rapidity
at
last
she
seems
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
an
officer
of
her
guards
named
riom
whose
only
merit
was
youth
he
subdued
her
she
became
as
docile
and
submissive
to
him
as
she
had
been
intractable
and
haughty
with
her
former
lovers
and
all
paris
was
talking
of
the
transformation
after
about
a
year
of
this
she
gave
birth
to
a
child
during
the
pains
of
childbirth
she
was
not
expected
to
live
and
the
curate
of
sulpice
was
sent
for
in
all
haste
to
administer
the
extreme
unction
the
ecclesiastic
happened
to
be
a
rigid
champion
of
morality
and
he
refused
to
administer
the
rite
till
riom
had
been
dismissed
from
the
luxembourg
the
duchess
would
not
consent
to
part
with
her
lover
and
for
many
hours
this
strange
conflict
went
on
by
the
bedside
of
the
failing
woman
the
curate
was
obstinate
however
and
no
sacrament
was
administered
but
the
duchess
recovering
the
regent
used
his
authority
and
sent
riom
to
join
his
regiment
it
killed
his
daughter
she
invited
her
father
to
sup
with
her
and
used
all
her
eloquence
to
persuade
him
to
let
her
marry
riom
but
the
regent
remaining
firm
she
withdrew
to
her
chamber
took
to
her
bed
and
died
two
days
afterward
in
alluding
to
the
regent
mistresses
a
word
should
be
said
of
the
famous
claudine
du
tencin
whose
adventures
shed
a
flood
of
light
on
the
morals
of
the
day
she
was
a
pretty
girl
of
respectable
if
not
noble
family
living
in
a
distant
province
to
escape
from
a
marriage
that
was
forced
on
her
she
took
refuge
in
a
convent
instead
however
of
suiting
her
habits
to
her
place
of
residence
she
contrived
to
alter
the
mode
of
life
at
the
convent
so
as
to
meet
her
desires
and
it
became
famous
for
the
gayety
of
its
social
entertainments
and
the
liveliness
of
its
inmates
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
were
allowed
to
share
its
hospitality
was
the
poet
destouches
he
was
smitten
with
the
pretty
claudine
who
acknowledged
the
charm
of
his
accomplishments
and
after
a
few
months
intimacy
gave
birth
to
a
male
child
who
became
the
mathematician
and
philosopher
claudine
had
a
brother
an
abbé
a
man
of
considerable
cunning
and
no
principle
whatever
he
persuaded
his
sister
to
go
to
paris
and
seek
her
fortune
he
obtained
an
introduction
for
her
to
the
regent
and
claudine
contrived
to
produce
such
an
impression
that
she
was
soon
installed
as
titular
mistress
this
did
not
last
long
however
one
day
venturing
to
remonstrate
with
the
regent
on
his
loose
mode
of
life
his
habitual
drunkenness
her
lover
lost
patience
with
her
and
suddenly
summoned
a
crowd
of
his
courtiers
from
the
to
witness
the
déshabillé
and
listen
to
the
sermons
of
madame
in
revenge
claudine
rushed
out
and
became
the
mistress
of
the
prime
minister
cardinal
dubois
her
brother
the
abbé
got
a
bishopric
for
his
share
in
the
transaction
at
the
death
of
dubois
madame
du
tencin
gave
him
as
successor
the
duke
of
richelieu
the
most
famous
of
the
court
but
she
was
growing
old
and
ambition
had
more
attractions
for
her
than
love
she
became
an
authoress
wrote
religious
works
and
novels
patronized
letters
and
brought
out
montesquieu
spirit
of
laws
her
salons
became
the
most
fashionable
in
paris
it
was
not
a
little
singular
that
she
should
have
been
the
head
of
one
literary
clique
and
her
son
the
chief
of
another
neither
positively
jealous
of
the
other
yet
living
on
terms
of
cold
reserve
louis
xv
trod
in
the
steps
of
his
and
the
regent
his
amours
attracted
no
attention
being
evanescent
and
trifling
till
he
quarreled
with
the
queen
and
bestowed
the
title
of
mistress
on
the
countess
of
mailly
this
lady
had
four
sisters
three
of
whom
had
reached
womanhood
they
were
jealous
of
their
sister
success
and
solicited
a
share
of
the
royal
favor
the
monarch
graciously
granted
their
prayer
and
admitted
all
four
into
an
associate
he
was
much
hurt
when
the
fifth
at
the
age
of
sixteen
declined
an
interest
in
this
delectable
partnership
falling
ill
soon
afterward
he
allowed
his
confessor
to
frighten
him
into
parting
with
the
sisters
and
when
he
got
well
replaced
them
by
the
wife
of
the
subfarmer
of
the
finances
madame
le
normand
he
created
her
marquise
de
pompadour
and
compelled
the
court
to
recognize
her
happily
for
him
she
was
a
person
of
moderate
taste
and
habits
she
patronized
letters
was
the
friend
of
voltaire
and
seems
to
have
employed
her
influence
over
the
king
for
his
advantage
and
that
of
the
public
it
is
recorded
as
an
instance
of
the
heartlessness
of
the
king
that
when
she
died
he
stood
at
a
window
to
watch
her
funeral
pass
and
noticing
that
it
was
a
rainy
day
observed
with
a
smile
that
the
marquise
had
bad
weather
for
her
long
journey
her
successor
was
madame
dubarry
a
common
prostitute
fished
out
of
the
paris
stews
in
consequence
of
her
skill
in
debauchery
her
real
name
was
vanbernier
but
in
order
to
present
her
at
court
a
nobleman
of
the
name
of
dubarry
was
persuaded
to
marry
her
it
was
under
her
reign
that
the
aux
in
which
madame
de
pompadour
was
said
to
have
had
a
hand
reached
its
highest
point
of
celebrity
and
eclat
this
was
a
royal
seraglio
filled
with
the
most
beautiful
girls
that
could
be
bought
or
stolen
the
monstrous
old
debauchee
who
filled
the
throne
of
france
had
a
weakness
for
very
young
girls
fifteen
being
the
age
at
which
he
preferred
his
mistresses
under
the
skillful
directions
of
dubarry
a
host
of
pimps
and
purveyors
searched
france
for
young
girls
to
suit
the
king
fancy
where
negotiations
could
not
be
effected
the
prerogative
was
stretched
and
the
police
authorities
judiciously
blinded
but
we
are
led
to
believe
that
it
was
seldom
necessary
to
resort
to
these
violent
measures
and
that
french
fathers
of
that
day
seldom
made
difficulties
except
about
the
sum
to
be
paid
that
the
king
was
liberal
may
be
inferred
from
the
sum
which
this
seraglio
cost
him
not
less
than
one
hundred
millions
of
francs
it
was
a
large
handsomely
furnished
building
at
versailles
giving
every
woman
her
separate
apartments
the
king
rarely
visited
each
one
more
than
three
or
four
times
but
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
he
prided
himself
on
observing
the
etiquette
of
a
husband
he
insisted
on
the
poor
child
whom
he
was
about
to
ruin
kneeling
down
by
the
bedside
and
saying
her
prayers
in
his
presence
it
need
hardly
be
observed
that
the
parc
aux
cerfs
was
the
great
reservoir
from
whence
the
brothels
of
the
time
derived
their
supply
of
recruits
after
a
residence
of
a
few
weeks
or
months
in
case
they
became
pregnant
the
poor
children
were
thrown
out
upon
the
world
and
ruin
was
a
necessity
the
last
monarch
of
the
old
french
line
the
unfortunate
louis
forms
a
bright
contrast
to
his
predecessors
his
education
had
been
severe
his
principles
were
naturally
strict
placed
upon
the
throne
after
the
revolution
had
become
inevitable
his
whole
attention
was
devoted
to
the
business
of
reigning
and
attempting
reforms
which
came
quite
too
late
neither
he
nor
his
wife
ever
gave
rise
to
merited
scandal
the
profligate
character
of
the
court
was
however
sustained
by
the
orleans
family
and
their
connections
philippe
egalité
was
a
true
descendant
of
the
regent
on
the
very
eve
of
the
revolution
he
indulged
in
orgies
that
were
closely
imitated
from
those
of
the
palais
royal
our
sketch
of
the
immoralities
of
the
french
court
naturally
ends
here
though
the
period
of
the
directory
was
marked
by
a
general
looseness
in
the
best
french
society
and
both
napoleon
and
louis
xviii
set
no
example
of
conjugal
fidelity
to
their
subjects
yet
vice
was
not
exhibited
so
openly
under
them
as
it
had
been
under
former
kings
and
the
laws
of
decency
were
not
actually
set
at
defiance
their
frailties
were
private
matters
into
which
it
is
scarcely
the
duty
of
the
historian
to
intrude
the
same
may
be
said
of
charles
and
louis
philippe
the
former
had
in
his
youth
been
a
sharer
of
many
of
the
excesses
of
the
orleans
family
but
at
the
time
he
became
king
he
was
an
old
man
and
could
afford
to
lead
a
decent
life
louis
philippe
had
never
afforded
a
theme
for
scandal
and
as
king
he
set
an
example
of
rigorous
morality
if
we
turn
back
now
to
the
period
of
the
regency
we
shall
find
letters
sympathizing
in
the
most
marked
manner
with
the
court
under
the
regime
of
severe
etiquette
and
decency
established
by
louis
authors
respected
the
ear
of
innocence
under
the
brutal
sway
of
the
regent
and
the
lewd
influence
of
the
satyr
louis
the
old
prostitution
of
literature
was
revived
thus
we
find
that
the
most
successful
authors
of
the
day
such
as
voltaire
handled
themes
grossly
immoral
in
themselves
and
rendered
still
more
offensive
by
their
mode
of
treatment
the
most
popular
novel
of
the
eighteenth
century
manon
lescant
the
work
by
the
way
of
an
abbé
is
the
narrative
of
the
adventures
of
a
prostitute
of
all
the
romance
writers
of
that
age
no
one
was
more
widely
popular
or
more
generally
read
than
crebillon
whose
works
would
almost
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police
at
the
present
time
diderot
mirabeau
montesquieu
and
with
few
exceptions
all
the
most
eminent
men
of
france
prostituted
their
genius
to
the
composition
of
erotic
works
which
were
widely
read
by
women
as
well
as
men
of
the
light
poetry
of
the
eighteenth
century
very
little
is
fit
for
modern
reading
the
poets
being
as
a
general
rule
either
dull
or
depraved
nor
were
the
arts
behindhand
frescoes
differing
but
little
from
those
which
had
adorned
fontainebleau
under
francis
again
covered
the
walls
of
rich
men
houses
and
the
most
fortunate
painters
of
the
day
were
those
who
could
best
outrage
decency
without
positively
suggesting
the
brothel
lewd
books
and
pictures
were
freely
sold
in
paris
during
the
regency
the
reign
of
louis
and
the
revolutionary
period
napoleon
burned
all
he
could
find
but
there
still
remained
enough
to
supply
the
demand
almost
ever
since
it
should
be
noticed
in
connection
with
the
state
of
morals
in
france
during
the
second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
the
tendency
of
the
philosophical
doctrines
which
were
then
current
was
to
undermine
the
respect
paid
to
marriage
and
chastity
the
former
being
a
sacrament
was
assailed
as
part
of
the
ecclesiastical
system
the
latter
was
conceived
to
be
at
war
with
the
natural
and
therefore
the
proper
passions
of
mankind
several
of
the
philosophers
left
it
to
be
inferred
from
their
writings
or
stated
broadly
that
promiscuous
intercourse
or
at
all
events
unlimited
facilities
of
divorce
were
the
natural
destiny
of
the
human
race
and
that
the
restrictions
which
have
been
imposed
on
sensual
gratification
had
no
warrant
in
reason
or
sound
ethics
these
foolish
notions
brought
forth
fruits
after
their
kind
under
the
directory
prostitutes
were
received
into
certain
societies
and
ladies
of
fashion
became
prostitutes
even
under
the
empire
it
was
not
unusual
for
a
lady
to
request
her
husband
to
pay
her
a
visit
as
it
was
well
perhaps
to
avoid
questions
of
legitimacy
arising
at
any
future
period
there
was
one
branch
of
society
in
which
morality
had
made
great
progress
during
the
century
that
was
the
church
it
still
contained
cardinals
like
dubois
and
bishops
and
abbés
like
du
tencin
but
the
vast
body
of
the
country
clergy
led
pure
moral
lives
this
point
is
placed
beyond
a
doubt
by
the
silence
of
the
parties
opposed
to
the
hierarchy
when
the
revolution
broke
out
and
they
were
so
disposed
to
assail
the
priesthood
on
every
vulnerable
point
it
may
be
broadly
stated
that
the
vices
which
had
infected
the
whole
body
of
the
clergy
during
the
sixteenth
century
had
disappeared
by
the
eighteenth
despite
the
law
of
celibacy
the
country
curates
were
as
a
rule
moral
austere
virtuous
men
chapter
ix
syphilis
first
recorded
appearance

condition
of

syphilitic
plan
of
establishment
of
the
hospital
du
reforms
visiting
statistics
of
progress
and
condition
of
disease
it
properly
belongs
to
this
chapter
to
allude
to
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
diseases
termed
syphilitic
whether
they
were
of
ancient
date
whether
the
shameful
diseases
which
have
been
mentioned
in
the
chapter
devoted
to
prostitution
at
rome
were
the
same
as
the
modern
syphilis
may
be
decided
by
the
reader
it
will
suffice
here
to
say
that
throughout
the
middle
ages
a
species
of
disease
termed
sometimes
leprosy
sometimes
appears
to
have
prevailed
in
france
as
in
other
european
countries
and
to
have
chosen
for
its
chief
seat
the
organs
of
generation
it
was
not
however
till
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
that
public
attention
began
to
be
generally
directed
to
the
subject
of
sexual
disease
we
shall
briefly
enumerate
the
earliest
notices
of
its
appearance
when
charles
viii
entered
naples
in
he
found
the
city
suffering
from
a
plague
syphilis
to
which
the
prejudice
of
the
natives
gave
the
name
of
french
malady
italy
said
the
writers
of
the
day
was
attacked
simultaneously
by
the
french
army
and
this
new
disease
most
of
the
italian
writers
accuse
the
french
of
its
introduction
benevenis
however
says
they
got
it
from
the
spaniards
and
guicciardini
candidly
admits
that
his
countrymen
were
the
real
propagators
of
the
malady
german
physicians
likewise
traced
its
origin
to
naples
and
placed
it
about
the
year
ascribing
it
to
an
untoward
planetary
conjunction
the
disease
appeared
at
barcelona
in
and
in
other
parts
of
spain
in
the
following
year
but
sixty
years
before
in
public
regulations
had
been
made
in
london
to
prevent
the
admission
of
persons
attacked
with
a
disease
very
similar
to
syphilis
into
houses
of
prostitution
and
requiring
the
police
to
keep
constant
watch
over
such
as
should
show
symptoms
of
this
the
first
authentic
allusion
to
the
disease
in
france
is
the
ordinance
of
the
parliament
of
paris
dated
ordering
all
persons
attacked
by
the
large
pox
to
vacate
the
city
within
hours
and
not
to
return
till
they
were
cured
providing
a
sort
of
hospital
for
those
who
can
not
move
and
appointing
agents
to
bestow
four
on
the
exiles
to
pay
for
their
journey
this
ordinance
alludes
to
the
disease
having
been
prevalent
for
two
years
it
may
therefore
be
taken
for
granted
that
whether
syphilitic
diseases
had
existed
before
or
not
they
prevailed
to
a
very
alarming
extent
throughout
europe
at
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
to
prevent
misconception
it
may
be
as
well
to
give
the
diagnostic
signs
of
the
french
malady
as
furnished
by
fracastor
the
patients
were
in
low
spirits
and
broken
down
their
faces
were
pale
most
of
them
had
chancres
upon
the
organs
of
generation
these
chancres
were
obstinate
when
cured
in
one
place
they
reappeared
in
another
and
the
work
was
never
ended
pustules
with
a
hard
surface
appeared
upon
the
skin
generally
on
the
head
first
on
first
appearing
they
were
small
but
gradually
increased
to
the
size
of
an
acorn
which
they
resembled
in
shape
in
some
cases
they
were
dry
in
others
humid
some
were
livid
others
white
and
pale
others
again
hard
and
reddish
they
burst
after
a
few
days
and
discharged
an
incredible
quantity
of
vile
fetid
humor
when
they
began
to
suppurate
they
became
true
phagedænic
ulcers
consuming
both
flesh
and
bone
when
they
attacked
the
upper
part
of
the
body
they
gave
rise
to
malign
fluxions
which
gnawed
away
the
palate
or
the
windpipe
or
the
throat
or
the
tonsils
some
patients
lost
their
lips
others
the
nose
others
the
eyes
others
the
whole
organs
of
generation
many
were
troubled
with
moist
tumors
on
the
limbs
which
grew
as
large
as
eggs
or
small
loaves
when
they
burst
a
white
and
mucilaginous
liquor
exuded
from
them
they
were
usually
found
on
the
legs
and
arms
some
were
ulcerated
others
again
remained
callous
to
the
last
and
as
if
this
was
not
enough
the
patients
suffered
terrible
pains
especially
at
night
not
only
in
the
articulations
but
in
the
limbs
and
nerves
some
sufferers
however
had
pustules
without
pains
others
pains
without
pustules
but
in
most
cases
both
occurred
together
the
patients
were
languid
had
no
appetite
desired
to
remain
constantly
in
bed
the
face
and
legs
swelled
some
had
a
slight
fever
but
this
was
rare
others
had
severe
headaches
for
which
no
remedy
could
be
found
at
first
it
seems
the
faculty
strangely
misapprehending
its
duties
refused
to
treat
patients
assailed
by
this
new
plague
as
at
rome
they
were
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
quacks
barbers
and
old
women
about
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
however
the
extent
of
the
mischief
provoked
sympathy
from
the
physicians
and
one
or
two
treatises
appeared
on
the
subject
sudorifics
seem
to
have
been
the
chief
agent
employed
large
use
was
made
of
holy
wood
the
wood
of
the
which
was
imported
from
america
for
the
purpose
it
was
doses
of
holy
wood
in
decoction
which
are
said
to
have
saved
the
life
of
the
great
erasmus
after
the
passage
of
the
law
of
a
house
in
the
faubourg
germain
was
appropriated
to
the
reception
of
the
victims
of
syphilis
but
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
attempt
was
made
to
treat
them
there
they
were
left
to
die
or
to
quack
themselves
eighteen
years
after
in
the
house
in
question
being
too
small
for
the
numbers
of
the
sick
and
it
being
clearly
shown
that
syphilis
was
not
contagious
except
by
sexual
intercourse
or
positive
peculiar
contact
with
the
person
afflicted
a
new
decree
of
parliament
appropriated
funds
for
the
construction
of
a
hospital
for
persons
attacked
by
the
large
pox
grands
and
directed
that
they
should
be
properly
cared
for
this
decree
was
never
carried
into
effect
thirty
years
afterward
the
condition
of
the
sick
was
far
worse
than
it
had
ever
been
they
being
left
to
die
in
the
streets
a
new
decree
in
appointed
commissioners
to
choose
a
locality
for
a
hospital
and
notwithstanding
some
opposition
from
the
religious
authorities
they
performed
their
task
a
small
hospital
was
appropriated
to
syphilitic
patients
and
persons
suffering
from
itch
epilepsy
and
vitus
dance
it
was
soon
filled
and
several
patients
were
thrust
into
the
same
bed
owing
to
mismanagement
on
the
part
of
the
directors
it
was
short
of
linen
lint
and
medicine
the
parliament
interfered
but
without
success
and
in
despair
the
unfortunate
sufferers
contrived
to
effect
an
entrance
into
the
hospital
general
the
hotel
dieu
they
were
soon
admitted
on
the
same
terms
as
other
sufferers
but
as
the
establishment
was
far
too
small
to
accommodate
all
who
sought
refuge
there
they
were
thrust
four
and
five
together
into
the
same
bed
and
persons
with
syphilitic
diseases
lay
by
the
side
of
men
in
contagious
fevers
and
others
with
broken
legs
and
arms
the
parliament
interfered
a
second
time
the
municipal
officers
of
paris
were
assembled
and
called
upon
to
provide
a
hospital
for
venereal
cases
but
for
many
years
the
strenuous
opposition
of
the
hotel
dieu
neutralized
all
the
efforts
that
were
made
it
was
not
till
that
the
project
of
the
parliament
was
realized
and
a
syphilitic
hospital
actually
opened
up
to
this
time
that
is
to
say
for
a
period
of
a
century
and
a
quarter
persons
attacked
by
venereal
disease
were
left
to
the
care
of
providence
males
could
with
some
exertion
occasionally
obtain
admission
to
the
hotel
dieu
where
they
often
contracted
new
diseases
without
getting
rid
of
the
old
but
of
females
not
a
word
had
yet
been
spoken
no
one
in
that
hundred
and
years
had
ever
raised
a
voice
to
plead
on
behalf
of
the
prostitutes
it
never
seems
to
have
occurred
even
to
the
parliament
which
had
so
much
sympathy
for
the
that
the
women
likewise
deserved
pity
and
attention
we
possess
no
information
with
regard
to
the
treatment
used
in
this
new
hospital
it
is
certain
however
that
in
obedience
to
the
law
of
its
foundation
patients
were
soundly
whipped
when
they
entered
and
when
they
left
it
by
way
of
punishing
them
for
having
contracted
the
disease
in
the
managers
of
the
hospital
declared
that
this
practice
deterred
many
sick
persons
from
coming
forward
and
confessing
their
condition
but
it
prevailed
apparently
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
afterward
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
under
the
reign
of
louis
a
hospital
prison
named
the
salpétrière
was
established
for
the
reception
of
prostitutes
but
by
a
strange
inconsistency
in
it
was
closed
to
women
suffering
from
syphilis
and
physicians
were
directed
to
examine
all
women
who
showed
symptoms
of
syphilis
on
the
face
a
few
years
experience
showed
the
fallacy
of
this
system
diseased
women
were
confined
in
the
place
should
they
not
be
treated
there
the
physicians
thought
they
should
and
accordingly
though
in
violation
of
the
rules
of
the
establishment
a
small
room
was
appropriated
to
this
class
of
patients
it
appears
that
at
this
time
a
prostitute
found
some
difficulty
in
obtaining
admission
to
the
salpétrière
it
being
not
unusual
for
unfortunate
creatures
to
have
themselves
arrested
for
vagabondage
and
to
submit
voluntarily
to
the
whipping
which
the
ethics
of
the
day
required
in
the
case
of
females
as
well
as
males
in
order
to
obtain
medical
treatment
it
will
be
seen
that
our
new
york
system
can
not
claim
the
merit
of
originality
prostitutes
in
fact
flocked
to
the
salpétrière
in
such
numbers
that
the
room
furnished
by
the
connivance
of
the
authorities
was
soon
far
too
small
to
accommodate
them
the
hospital
managers
declared
to
the
royal
government
that
medical
treatment
was
out
of
the
question
in
so
crowded
an
apartment
and
that
a
putrid
fever
might
be
expected
if
better
accommodations
were
not
provided
in
reply
the
government
placed
at
their
disposal
a
ward
in
the
hospital
of
bicêtre
this
was
in
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
afterward
the
severe
cases
of
venereal
disease
were
sent
to
bicêtre
the
milder
ones
kept
at
salpétrière
both
establishments
were
a
disgrace
to
humanity
the
patients
were
cheated
of
the
food
allowed
them
and
supplied
with
cheap
broth
and
cheese
in
its
stead
no
baths
and
but
few
medicines
were
at
their
command
their
ward
was
filthy
close
and
in
ruin
patients
were
often
obliged
to
wait
so
long
for
medical
attendance
that
their
maladies
became
incurable
the
air
in
which
they
lived
was
pestiferous
and
no
one
could
visit
the
hospital
without
being
shocked
at
its
aspect
medical
men
who
saw
the
place
expressed
amazement
that
so
many
persons
should
exist
in
so
small
a
room
eight
women
slept
in
a
bed
and
in
the
room
appropriated
to
those
whose
turn
for
treatment
had
not
come
the
patients
slept
by
gangs
one
half
sleeping
from
to
and
the
remainder
from
to
the
floor
was
covered
with
dirt
and
filth
and
the
windows
were
nailed
down
for
fear
of
their
being
broken
if
opened
there
was
but
little
linen
and
that
was
in
rags
and
abominably
dirty
one
hundred
persons
only
were
treated
at
a
time
fifty
men
and
fifty
women
a
new
batch
was
admitted
to
treatment
every
two
months
and
as
the
hospital
always
contained
from
three
to
four
hundred
sufferers
some
cases
remained
six
or
eight
months
without
any
treatment
whatever
many
died
before
they
reached
the
hands
of
the
doctors
the
diet
was
the
same
for
all
those
who
had
not
been
admitted
to
treatment
were
supplied
with
coarse
bread
cheese
rancid
butter
and
very
seldom
a
little
meat
the
surgeons
of
bicêtre
usually
made
fortunes
in
a
short
time
if
any
thing
farther
were
needed
to
characterize
the
hospital
of
bicêtre
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
would
be
the
rules
in
virtue
of
which
no
diseased
person
could
claim
admission
until
a
complete
year
had
elapsed
from
the
time
of
their
first
application
and
every
diseased
person
was
turned
out
whether
ill
or
well
after
six
weeks
treatment
it
was
stated
to
that
the
average
mortality
was
one
hundred
women
and
sixty
men
per
annum
in
cullerier
was
appointed
surgeon
in
charge
of
syphilitic
cases
at
bicêtre
he
commenced
his
administration
by
denouncing
the
state
of
things
he
found
there
and
it
is
mainly
from
the
he
addressed
to
the
government
that
the
preceding
facts
have
been
obtained
his
representations
seem
to
have
met
with
but
little
success
in
however
the
bulk
of
the
prisoners
at
bicêtre
were
set
free
and
he
immediately
availed
himself
of
the
increased
room
to
accommodate
his
patients
the
reform
was
so
slight
or
rather
so
vast
a
reform
was
needed
that
the
moment
the
attention
of
the
republican
government
was
drawn
to
the
subject
it
removed
the
syphilitic
cases
from
the
hospital
of
bicêtre
to
the
hospital
of
the
capuchins
that
establishment
was
enlarged
and
named
the
hospital
of
the
south
du
midi
gardens
and
baths
were
provided
ample
wards
permitted
the
classification
of
diseases
the
food
was
of
the
best
kind
and
sufficient
in
quantity
this
immense
step
was
the
work
of
the
republican
authorities
it
was
however
only
the
first
of
a
series
of
reforms
originally
men
and
women
of
all
grades
were
admitted
promiscuously
this
led
to
grave
inconveniences
the
decorum
of
the
hospital
was
frequently
disturbed
by
the
conduct
of
some
of
the
men
with
regard
to
the
prostitutes
in
the
adjoining
wards
to
obviate
this
a
new
hospital
was
set
apart
under
the
reign
of
charles
for
the
reception
of
male
patients
only
it
is
the
hospital
de
lourcine
a
still
more
serious
trouble
arose
from
the
mixture
of
prostitutes
with
other
women
who
from
the
infidelity
of
their
husbands
hereditary
disease
or
other
causes
found
themselves
infected
with
syphilis
for
some
time
complaints
had
been
made
on
this
head
but
an
accident
which
occurred
in
compelled
the
authorities
to
act
the
daughter
of
a
professional
nurse
residing
in
the
vicinity
of
paris
caught
syphilis
from
a
child
her
mother
was
nursing
who
had
inherited
the
disease
it
took
the
shape
of
a
virulent
chancre
on
the
palate
and
the
girl
was
sent
to
the
hospital
du
midi
for
treatment
she
found
herself
thrust
among
the
vilest
prostitutes
whose
language
and
sentiments
shocked
her
so
terribly
that
she
insisted
on
leaving
the
hospital
at
once
the
physician
on
duty
declined
to
grant
her
request
whereupon
the
poor
girl
contrived
to
get
into
the
yard
and
threw
herself
into
a
well
she
was
drowned
and
on
an
autopsy
of
her
corpse
it
appeared
that
she
was
a
virgin
this
dreadful
incident
aroused
the
public
mind
hitherto
the
disposal
of
the
prostitutes
had
been
a
subject
of
dispute
between
the
administration
of
the
hospital
and
that
of
the
city
each
wishing
to
thrust
them
upon
the
other
the
government
now
interfered
and
special
accommodation
was
provided
for
prostitutes
at
the
prison
of
saint
lazare
the
hospital
du
midi
was
devoted
exclusively
to
such
women
as
were
not
inscribed
on
the
rolls
of
the
police
before
these
distributions
took
place
when
men
and
women
were
indiscriminately
received
at
the
hospital
du
midi
the
average
annual
admissions
from
to
were
from
to
it
exceeded
an
average
of
twenty
years
ago
the
mortality
was
said
to
be
less
than
two
per
cent
it
was
ten
per
cent
at
bicêtre
at
the
hospital
du
midi
diseased
persons
who
do
not
desire
admission
to
the
hospital
are
treated
outside
all
the
medicines
they
require
being
furnished
them
free
of
charge
it
would
appear
from
stray
allusions
in
various
old
ordinances
that
some
sort
of
medical
office
had
been
established
in
the
eighteenth
century
by
the
government
for
the
purpose
of
affording
gratuitous
advice
to
prostitutes
and
denouncing
those
who
were
diseased
but
there
exists
no
positive
evidence
of
any
such
establishment
or
office
it
was
not
till
that
a
regulation
was
made
by
the
prefect
of
police
requiring
all
public
women
to
submit
to
be
visited
by
a
physician
appointed
by
him
the
plan
was
a
bad
one
as
the
physician
was
paid
by
fees
which
he
was
authorized
to
exact
and
it
was
rendered
worse
in
practice
by
the
dishonesty
of
the
man
chosen
for
the
office
one
coulon
this
individual
made
money
and
neglected
his
duties
the
system
was
altered
in
and
a
dispensary
established
with
a
strong
medical
staff
who
were
directed
to
visit
all
the
prostitutes
in
paris
this
institution
is
still
in
existence
it
will
be
further
noticed
in
the
next
chapter
when
the
dispensary
was
established
its
medical
officers
were
directed
to
offer
to
prostitutes
the
choice
of
being
treated
at
home
or
going
to
the
hospital
almost
all
chose
the
former
the
physicians
then
undertook
to
decide
themselves
which
should
go
to
the
hospital
and
which
remain
in
their
houses
the
results
of
their
experience
and
the
policy
it
compelled
them
to
adopt
are
shown
in
the
following
table
which
was
compiled
by

the
system
of

it
was
found
they
could
not
be
compelled
to
take
the
medicines
given
them
and
that
though
laboring
under
the
most
severe
disease
they
would
not
abstain
from
the
exercise
of
their
calling
the
tables
prepared
by
the
sanitary
office
or
dispensary
at
paris
afford
a
clear
view
of
the
extent
and
progress
of
disease
in
that
city

those
which
are
furnished
by

other

that
the

of

to

varies
widely
in
different
years
in
it

is
to

six

prostitutes
were

four

five

would
seem
a
tolerably
fair

from
another

by
the

we
gather
that
during

the
vast
importance
of
the
subject
will
doubtless
justify
the
length
at
which
it
must
be
treated
it
was
usual
during
the

to
estimate
the
number
of

in

at

thirty
thousand
even
as
late
as
the
number
was
said
by
good
authority
to
be
not
less
than
eighteen
thousand
the
police
rolls
show
that
these
calculations
were
wide
of
the
mark
according
to
them
the
average
number
of
prostitutes
inscribed
had
risen
from
about
in
to
in
the
last
year
of
which
we
have
any
record

that
the
number
at

those
bordering

being
the
most
fruitful
of
prostitutes
and

being
largely
in

tailors
plasterers
pavers

whereas
there
were
only
surgeons

and

the
inference
drawn
by
from
this
is
that
brothels
are
supplied
from
the
classes
of
domestics
and
and
that
girls
not
bred
to
work
rarely
find
their
way
into
them
rather
more
than
one
third
of
the
fathers
of
these
prostitutes
were
unable
to
sign
their
names
of
the
prostitutes
born
at
paris
about
one
fourth
were
illegitimate
of
those
born
in
the
departments
one
eighth
were
illegitimate
rather
more
than
half
the
paris
prostitutes
could
not
write
their
names
a
degree
of
ignorance
which
argues
very
remarkable
neglect
on
the
part
of
parents
for
at
paris
every
one
may
learn
to
write
gratuitously
and
a
person
who
can
not
write
will
always
experience
difficulty
in
obtaining
employment
nearly
half
the
prostitutes
were
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
inclusive
one
declared
herself
or
was
proved
to
be
only
twelve
years
old
were
over
fifty
two

over
sixty
on
reference
to
the
rolls

it
appeared
that
the
bulk
of
the
prostitutes
registered
themselves
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
but
were
inscribed
before
the
age
of
fourteen

may
be
assumed
to
be
the
period
of
puberty
in
france

passing

total
it
appears
that
there
were
in
paris
in
two
hundred
and
twenty
tolerated
houses
that
is
to
say
brothels
the
rules
regarding
these
are
numerous
they
can
not
be
established
in
certain
localities
such
as
the
boulevards
or
other
great
thoroughfares
they
must
not
be
within
one
hundred
yards
of
a
church
or
within
fifty
or
sixty
yards
of
a
school
whether
for
boys
or
girls
of
a
palace
or
other
public
building
or
of
a
large
the
proprietor
of
the
house
must
have
given
his
consent
before
the
house
can
be
used
as
a
brothel
two
houses
can
not
be
established
side
by
side
much
less
can
they
have
the
same
entry
as
a
general
rule
a
preference
is
given
to
small
narrow
streets
especially
de
and
to
places
where
brothels
have
been
established
before
with
regard
to
the
interior
of
these
houses
they
must
contain
a
room
for
each
girl
on
no
account
are
two
prostitutes
allowed
to
occupy
the
same
room
much
less
the
same
bed
each
room
must
moreover
be
amply
provided
with
utensils
soap
and
water
for
ablution
no
house
of
prostitution
can
have
back
or
side
doors
or
in
any
way
communicate
with
the
adjoining
buildings
no
house
can
contain
dark
closets
or
dark
passages
or
concealed
in
none
of
them
can
any
trade
or
traffic
be
carried
on
with
regard
to
the
class
of
houses
called
de
assignation
houses
the
police
authorities
require
that
in
every
such
house
two
regular
prostitutes
inscribed
on
the
police
rolls
shall
live
permanently
the
object
of
this
rule
is
to
obtain
a
control
and
supervision
over
these
houses
before
it
was
adopted
the
police
was
often
embarrassed
by
denials
of
its
authority
to
invade
them
it
is
found
that
the
prostitutes
being
naturally
hostile
to
the
mistresses
of
the
houses
will
act
as
agents
of
the
police
in
the
event
of
any
scandalous
proceedings
the
windows
of
houses
of
prostitution
must
be
roughed
as
also
must
those
of
rooms
where
individual
prostitutes
live
they
can
only
be
partially
opened
these
regulations
were
made
in
consequence
of
the
shocking
scenes
that
were
witnessed
at
the
windows
of
brothels
after
the
revolution
naked
women
being
the
least
of
the
scandals
that
used
to
be
exposed
no
one
can
keep
a
house
of
prostitution
in
paris
without
an
authorization
from
the
police
men
are
never
permitted
to
keep
establishments
of
the
kind
a
woman
who
desires
to
open
a
house
must
apply
in
writing
to
the
prefect
of
police
on
receipt
of
her
application
reference
is
made
to
the
commissary
of
police
of
the
ward
to
ascertain
her
character
if
she
has
been
condemned
for
crime
or
misdemeanor
her
request
is
rarely
granted
if
she
stands
in
the
police
books
as
a
woman
requiring
supervision
she
can
not
succeed
nor
can
she
obtain
a
license
under
ordinary
circumstances
she
has
been
a
prostitute
the
reason
of
this
regulation
is
obvious
no
one
but
a
prostitute
understands
the
business
thoroughly
and
as
the
position
of
is
found
to
be
the
most
demoralizing
station
in
the
world
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
paris
police
to
throw
impediments
in
the
way
of
persons
not
wholly
depraved
devoting
themselves
to
so
dangerous
a
calling
furthermore
the
applicant
must
have
reached
a
certain
age
she
must
also
be
of
sober
habits
and
apparently
possessed
of
sufficient
force
of
character
to
be
able
to
command
a
house
full
of
prostitutes
she
must
possess
a
sum
of
money
sufficient
to
guarantee
her
against
immediate
failure
and
she
must
own
the
furniture
in
the
house
she
wishes
to
keep
when
all
these
conditions
are
fulfilled
the
applicant
receives
a
in
which
the
number
of
girls
she
is
allowed
to
keep
is
specified
in
this
book
she
is
bound
to
enter
the
name
of
every
prostitute
she
receives
whether
as
a
boarder
or
a
transient
lodger
her
age
the
date
of
her
entry
into
her
house
the
date
of
her
inspection
by
a
physician
and
the
date
of
her
departure
from
the
house
a
printed
form
in
the
beginning
of
the
reminds
the
mistress
of
the
house
that
she
is
bound
under
heavy
penalties
to
inscribe
on
the
police
rolls
every
girl
she
receives
within
hours
of
her
arrival
in
the
event
of
the
neglect
of
these
rules
by
the
keepers
of
houses
of
prostitution
the
license
is
revoked
it
is
understood
that
the
police
enforce
this
regulation
with
due
rigor
much
has
been
said
and
written
about
the
manner
in
which
the
keepers
of
houses
of
prostitution
obtain
recruits
whose
sources
of
information
were
the
best
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
most
of
the
prostitutes
are
obtained
from
the
hospitals
especially
the
hospital
du
midi
where
female
venereal
diseases
are
treated
it
appears
that
this
hospital
and
others
are
haunted
by
old
women
who
have
been
prostitutes
and
who
in
their
old
age
eke
out
a
livelihood
by
enticing
others
into
the
same
calling
they
soon
discover
the
antecedents
and
disposition
of
every
young
girl
they
find
in
hospitals
and
if
she
be
pretty
or
engaging
she
must
either
have
much
principle
or
careful
friends
to
rescue
her
from
the
clutches
of
the
old
hags
while
she
lies
ill
on
a
bed
of
pain
the
latter
are
constantly
with
her
and
gain
her
friendship
they
know
the
devices
that
are
needed
to
impose
on
her
simplicity
and
not
unfrequently
are
enabled
to
strengthen
their
promises
by
small
donations
in
money
or
a
weekly
stipend
during
her
convalescence
for
a
pretty
girl
as
much
as
fifty
francs
will
be
paid
by
a
as
the
girls
in
france
with
few
exceptions
come
to
paris
to
be
cured
when
they
have
contracted
disease
from
association
with
lovers
it
seems
quite
likely
that
as
supposes
these
hospitals
are
a
fruitful
source
of
prostitutes
other
have
female
agents
in
the
country
towns
who
send
them
girls
one
woman
who
kept
for
many
years
one
of
the
largest
establishments
in
france
employed
a
traveling
clerk
with
a
large
salary
some
obtain
boarders
from
their
own
province
or
native
city
others
who
have
followed
a
trade
get
recruits
from
the
acquaintances
they
made
at
the
workshop
latterly
it
would
seem
pimps
have
carried
on
their
trade
with
unusual
boldness
and
success
some
time
since
it
was
noticed
that
an
uncommon
number
of
girls
arrived
at
paris
from
rheims
they
all
came
provided
with
the
name
and
address
of
the
houses
to
which
they
were
destined
and
drove
there
from
the
information
was
sent
to
the
police
authorities
of
rheims
and
on
their
arrival
the
girls
were
sent
back
again
the
design
of
the
authorities
was
baffled
for
a
while
by
the
cunning
of
the
pimps
who
sent
their
recruits
round
by
other
roads
but
the
police
finally
triumphed
by
refusing
for
a
year
or
two
to
inscribe
any
prostitutes
from
rheims
it
is
notorious
however
that
the
same
traffic
is
carried
on
at
the
present
day
to
an
alarming
extent
between
london
and
paris
london
and
brussels
and
other
large
cities
in
the
neighborhood
several
societies
have
been
formed
and
the
police
have
made
great
exertions
to
suppress
the
trade
but
without
any
particular
success
it
is
understood
that
the
prostitutes
of
paris
receive
nothing
for
their
labors
but
their
board
lodging
and
dress
the
latter
is
often
expensive
in
houses
it
will
exceed
five
hundred
francs
which
in
female
attire
will
go
as
far
at
paris
as
five
hundred
dollars
will
in
new
york
the
whole
of
the
fees
exacted
from
visitors
goes
to
the
mistress
and
the
girls
are
reluctantly
permitted
to
retain
the
presents
they
sometimes
receive
from
their
lovers
they
are
usually
in
debt
to
the
mistress
who
having
no
other
means
of
retaining
them
under
her
control
hastens
to
advance
them
money
for
jewelry
carriages
fine
eating
and
expensive
wines
no
written
contract
binds
them
to
remain
where
they
are
they
may
leave
when
they
please
if
they
can
pay
their
debts
and
the
obligation
they
incur
for
the
latter
is
one
of
honor
only
and
can
not
be
enforced
in
the
courts
houses
of
prostitution
when
well
conducted
are
very
profitable
in
paris
it
is
estimated
that
the
net
profits
accruing
from
each
girl
ought
to
be
ten
francs
or
more
per
day
many
keepers
of
houses
have
retired
with
from
ten
to
thousand
francs
a
year
and
have
married
their
daughters
well
the
of
a
popular
house
has
been
sold
for
sixty
thousand
francs
twelve
thousand
dollars
we
now
come
to
the
great
feature
of
the
paris
system
the
inscription
of
prostitutes
in
a
department
of
the
prefecture
of
police
called
the
des
it
seems
that
some
sort
of
inscription
was
in
use
before
the
revolution
but
no
law
referring
to
it
or
records
of
the
rolls
can
be
found
various
systems
were
employed
during
the
republic
and
the
empire
the
one
now
in
use
was
adopted
in
and
amended
by
a
police
regulation
of
prostitutes
are
inscribed
either
on
their
own
request
on
the
requisition
of
the
mistress
of
a
house
or
on
the
report
of
the
inspector
of
prostitutes
when
a
girl
appears
before
the
bureau
under
any
of
these
circumstances
she
is
asked
the
following
questions
the
answers
being
taken
down
in
writing
her
name
age
trade
and
residence
whether
she
is
a
widow
wife
or
spinster
whether
her
father
and
mother
are
living
and
what
their
calling
was
or
is
whether
she
lives
with
them
and
if
not
when
and
how
she
left
them
whether
she
has
had
children
and
where
they
are
how
long
she
has
been
at
paris
whether
any
one
has
a
right
to
claim
her
whether
she
has
ever
been
arrested
and
if
yes
how
often
and
for
what
offenses
whether
she
has
ever
been
a
prostitute
before
and
for
what
period
of
time
whether
she
has
or
has
had
venereal
disease
whether
she
has
received
any
education
what
her
motive
is
in
inscribing
herself
the
answers
to
these
inquiries
suggest
others
which
are
put
at
the
discretion
of
the
officials
their
practice
is
so
great
that
they
are
rarely
deceived
by
the
women
affirms
that
they
could
tell
an
old
prostitute
merely
by
the
way
she
sat
down
the
interrogatory
over
the
girl
is
taken
by
an
inspector
to
the
dispensary
and
examined
and
the
physician
on
duty
reports
the
result
which
is
added
to
the
inquiry
meanwhile
the
police
registers
have
been
consulted
and
if
the
girl
has
been
an
old
offender
or
is
known
to
the
police
she
is
now
identified
if
the
girl
has
her
baptismal
certificate
de
with
her
she
is
forthwith
inscribed
and
registered
among
the
public
women
of
paris
as
prostitutes
rarely
possess
this
document
however
a
provisional
inscription
is
usually
effected
and
a
direct
application
is
made
to
the
mayor
of
the
city
or
where
she
was
born
for
the
certificate
this
application
varies
according
to
the
age
of
the
girl
if
she
is
of
age
it
is
simply
a
demand
for
the
de
of
who
says
she
is
a
native
of
your
city
or
if
on
the
contrary
she
is
a
minor
the
application
states
that
a
girl
who
calls
herself
and
says
she
was
born
at
has
applied
for
inscription
in
this
office
i
desire
you
to
ascertain
the
position
of
her
family
and
what
means
they
propose
to
take
in
case
they
desire
to
secure
the
return
of
this
young
girl
it
often
happens
that
the
family
implore
the
intervention
of
the
police
in
that
case
the
girl
is
sent
back
to
the
place
whence
she
came
in
many
cases
the
family
decline
to
interfere
and
then
the
girl
is
duly
inscribed
on
the
register
she
signs
a
document
in
which
she
states
that
being
duly
acquainted
with
the
sanitary
regulations
established
by
the
prefecture
for
public
women
she
declares
that
she
will
submit
to
them
will
allow
herself
to
be
visited
periodically
by
the
physicians
of
the
dispensary
and
will
conform
in
all
respects
to
the
rules
in
force
of
course
this
procedure
is
occasionally
delayed
by
falsehoods
uttered
by
the
women
it
often
used
to
happen
that
the
mayors
would
report
that
no
person
of
the
name
given
had
been
born
at
the
time
fixed
in
their
city
or
commune
in
that
case
the
girl
was
recalled
and
made
to
understand
that
truth
was
better
policy
than
falsehood
girls
rarely
held
out
longer
than
a
fortnight
or
so
and
at
the
present
time
the
number
of
false
declarations
is
very
small
indeed
they
seem
satisfied
that
the
police
are
an
omniscient
machine
which
can
not
be
deceived
when
the
girl
is
brought
to
the
office
either
by
a
or
an
inspector
the
proceeding
is
slightly
varied
in
the
latter
case
she
has
been
arrested
for
indulging
in
clandestine
prostitution
but
she
almost
invariably
denies
the
fact
and
pleads
her
innocence
the
rule
in
this
case
is
to
admonish
her
and
let
her
go
it
is
not
till
the
third
or
fourth
offense
has
been
committed
that
she
is
inscribed
when
the
mistress
of
a
house
brings
a
girl
to
the
office
interrogatories
similar
to
the
above
are
put
to
her
if
she
has
relations
or
friends
at
paris
they
are
sent
for
and
consulted
when
the
girl
appears
evidently
lost
she
is
duly
inscribed
but
if
she
shows
any
signs
of
shame
or
contrition
she
is
often
sent
home
by
the
office
at
the
public
expense
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
when
a
girl
is
found
diseased
she
is
sent
to
hospital
and
her
inscription
held
over
it
occasionally
happens
that
virgins
present
themselves
at
the
office
and
desire
to
be
inscribed
in
their
case
the
officials
use
compulsion
to
rescue
them
from
infamy
in
a
word
the
paris
system
with
regard
to
inscriptions
is
to
inscribe
no
girl
with
regard
to
whom
it
is
not
manifest
that
she
will
carry
on
the
calling
of
a
prostitute
whether
she
be
inscribed
or
not
from
the
following
table
prepared
by
from
the
records
of
a
series
of
years
it
appears
that
the
mistresses
of
houses
inscribe
over
one
third
of
the
total
prostitutes
girls
inscribed
at
their
own
request
by
mistresses
of
houses
by
inspectors
total
the
age
at
which
girls
can
be
inscribed
has
varied
under
different
administrators
under
one
it
was
seventeen
under
his
successor
eighteen
under
the
next
years
but
now
the
general
rule
is
that
no
girl
should
be
inscribed
under
the
age
of
sixteen
exceptions
to
this
rule
are
made
in
the
case
of
younger
girls
of
thirteen
fourteen
or
fifteen
who
lead
a
life
of
prostitution
and
are
frequently
attacked
by
disease
from
a
regard
to
public
health
they
are
inscribed
notwithstanding
their
age
only
second
in
importance
to
the
subject
of
inscription
is
that
of
radiation
the
obliteration
of
an
inscription
this
is
the
process
by
which
a
prostitute
takes
leave
of
her
calling
throws
off
the
control
of
the
police
and
regains
her
civil
rights
at
rome
as
has
been
shown
already
no
such
formality
as
radiation
was
known
to
the
law
a
prostitute
always
a
was
the
roman
rule
this
system
did
not
long
sustain
the
test
of
a
christian
examination
the
policy
of
the
french
des
on
this
head
is
governed
by
two
very
simple
maxims
the
amendment
of
prostitutes
ought
to
be
encouraged
as
much
as
possible
but
no
prostitute
should
be
released
from
the
supervision
of
the
police
and
the
visits
of
the
dispensary
physicians
until
there
is
reasonable
ground
for
believing
that
her
repentance
and
alteration
of
life
are
sincere
and
likely
to
be
permanent
a
person
desiring
to
have
her
name
struck
from
the
rolls
of
public
women
must
make
a
written
application
specifying
her
reasons
for
desiring
to
change
her
mode
of
life
and
indicating
the
means
of
support
on
which
she
is
henceforth
to
rely
in
three
cases
the
demand
is
granted
forthwith
when
the
girl
that
she
is
about
to
marry
when
she
produces
the
certificate
of
a
physician
that
she
is
attacked
by
an
organic
disease
which
renders
it
impossible
for
her
to
continue
the
calling
of
a
prostitute
and
when
she
has
gone
to
live
with
her
relations
and
produces
evidence
of
her
late
good
behavior
in
all
other
cases
the
office
awards
a
provisional
radiation
for
a
period
of
time
which
varies
according
to
circumstances
from
three
months
to
a
year
the
girl
is
still
under
the
supervision
of
the
police
such
supervision
being
obviously
secret
and
discreet
when
the
girl
passes
triumphantly
through
this
period
of
probation
her
name
is
definitely
struck
from
the
roll
of
prostitutes
when
a
girl
after
having
her
name
thus
struck
out
desires
to
be
inscribed
afresh
her
request
is
granted
without
delay
or
inquiry
it
being
wisely
supposed
that
she
has
repented
of
her
decision
a
also
takes
place
when
a
girl
after
radiation
is
found
in
a
house
of
prostitution
even
as
a
servant
a
prostitute
is
struck
from
the
rolls
by
authority
of
the
office
when
she
has
disappeared
and
no
trace
of
her
has
been
found
for
three
months
gives
the
following
table
of
radiations
which
taken
in
connection
with
the
table
already
given
of
the
number
of
prostitutes
registered
shows
the
movement
of
reform
women
struck
off
the
rolls
of
prostitutes
at
their
of
absence
once
inscribed
prostitutes
are
divided
into
three
classes
those
who
live
in
a
licensed
or
tolerated
brothel
those
who
live
alone
in
furnished
rooms
those
who
live
in
rooms
which
they
furnish
and
outwardly
bear
no
mark
of
infamy
in
the
eye
of
the
law
there
is
no
difference
between
the
three
classes
all
are
equally
subject
to
police
and
medical
supervision
every
girl
that
is
inscribed
receives
a
card
bearing
her
name
and
the
number
of
her
page
in
the
register
a
blank
column
of
this
card
is
left
to
be
filled
by
a
memorandum
of
the
date
of
each
visit
by
the
physicians
of
the
dispensary
but
the
three
classes
differ
in
respect
of
the
place
where
they
are
visited
the
dispensary
physicians
visit
the
inmates
of
brothels
in
the
houses
where
they
live
all
other
prostitutes
visit
them
at
the
dispensary
yet
another
visit
is
made
by
the
dispensary
physicians
to
the
dépôt
or
at
the
prefecture
of
police
as
there
are
always
a
certain
number
of
prostitutes
arrested
for
drunkenness
or
disorderly
conduct
every
night
it
was
thought
well
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
their
confinement
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
their
health
all
houses
of
prostitution
are
visited
by
the
dispensary
physicians
once
a
week
the
hour
of
the
visit
is
known
beforehand
and
every
girl
must
be
present
and
pass
inspection
the
examination
is
private
the
result
is
noted
in
a
folio
kept
by
the
physician
and
a
corresponding
memorandum
is
made
in
the
of
the
house
and
on
the
card
of
the
prostitute
when
disease
is
detected
the
mistress
of
the
house
is
notified
and
cautioned
not
to
allow
the
girl
diseased
to
receive
any
visitors
that
afternoon
or
the
next
morning
she
comes
or
is
brought
to
the
dispensary
where
she
undergoes
a
second
examination
and
if
the
result
is
the
same
as
at
the
first
she
is
forthwith
sent
to
saint
lazare
for
treatment
free
prostitutes
that
is
to
say
those
who
live
in
lodgings
or
rooms
furnished
by
themselves
are
bound
to
visit
the
dispensary
and
submit
to
examination
once
a
fortnight
they
choose
the
time
and
day
themselves
but
more
than
a
fortnight
must
not
elapse
between
the
visits
it
appears
from
tables
published
by
that
these
rules
are
strictly
enforced
free
prostitutes
are
visited
nearly
thirty
times
a
year
and
prostitutes
in
tolerated
houses
more
than
fifty
times
we
have
alluded
elsewhere
to
the
results
of
the
visits
experience
has
proved
that
the
only
safe
method
of
punishment
for
prostitutes
is
imprisonment
formerly
they
were
whipped
and
at
a
later
date
their
hair
was
cut
off
but
the
humane
spirit
of
modern
legislation
has
rejected
both
these
punishments
as
unduly
cruel
at
the
present
day
offenses
against
the
rules
concerning
prostitution
de
are
punished
by
imprisonment
misdemeanors
and
crimes
provided
against
by
the
code
being
within
the
cognizance
of
the
ordinary
courts
in
the
case
of
prostitutes
as
well
as
other
persons
de
have
been
divided
by
the
des
into
two
classes
slight
offenses
and
grave
offenses
slight
offenses
are
to
appear
in
forbidden
places
to
appear
at
forbidden
hours
to
get
drunk
and
lie
down
in
doorways
streets
or
other
thoroughfares
to
demand
admittance
to
to
walk
through
the
streets
in
daylight
in
such
a
way
as
to
attract
the
notice
of
people
passing
to
rap
on
the
windows
of
their
rooms
to
absent
themselves
from
the
medical
inspection
to
beg
to
remain
more
than
hours
in
their
house
after
having
been
pronounced
diseased
by
the
physician
to
escape
from
the
hospital
or
dispensary
to
go
out
of
doors
with
bare
head
or
neck
to
remain
in
paris
after
having
been
ordered
to
leave
and
presented
with
a
passport
this
class
of
offenses
is
punished
by
imprisonment
for
not
less
than
a
fortnight
or
more
than
three
months
one
month
is
the
usual
term
a
prostitute
is
held
to
be
guilty
of
grave
offenses
when
she
insults
outrageously
the
visiting
physician
fails
to
visit
the
dispensary
continues
to
prostitute
herself
after
being
pronounced
diseased
uses
obscene
language
in
public
appears
naked
at
her
window
assails
men
with
violence
and
endeavors
to
drag
them
to
her
home
these
offenses
are
punished
by
imprisonment
for
not
less
than
three
months
and
not
more
than
a
year
rarely
more
than
six
months
the
time
is
fixed
in
these
cases
with
reference
to
the
former
character
of
the
prostitute
when
a
prostitute
is
arrested
she
is
taken
to
the
prefecture
of
police
where
there
is
a
room
specially
appropriated
to
her
class
she
is
tried
within
usually
within
hours
of
her
arrival
when
condemned
she
is
conveyed
in
a
close
carriage
or
van
to
the
prison
the
prison
at
paris
usually
contains
from
four
hundred
and
fifty
to
six
hundred
inmates
they
are
all
obliged
to
work
a
few
are
generally
found
incapable
either
from
idiocy
blindness
or
incorrigible
obstinacy
of
performing
even
the
simplest
work
these
are
lodged
in
a
department
called
the
ward
of
the
imbeciles
the
others
are
allowed
to
choose
their
work
the
bulk
naturally
take
to
sewing
they
are
paid
a
small
sum
for
what
they
do
partly
as
they
proceed
with
the
work
and
the
balance
when
they
leave
the
prison
industrious
girls
receive
from
the
money
coming
to
them
from
five
to
eight
daily
that
this
added
to
the
ample
food
supplied
by
the
prison
suffices
for
their
wants
is
proved
by
the
frequent
purchases
they
make
of
flowers
and
other
superfluities
formerly
prostitutes
in
prison
were
not
expected
to
work
and
at
this
period
fights
and
disturbances
were
of
constant
occurrence
now
the
discipline
is
excellent
and
the
prisoners
orderly
the
only
penalty
for
disobedience
of
rules
or
misconduct
is
close
confinement
in
the
admits
that
the
prison
discipline
is
so
gentle
that
the
punishment
has
no
terrors
for
prostitutes
it
is
quite
common
to
find
girls
who
have
been
thirty
times
condemned
to
imprisonment
he
recommends
the
use
of
the
as
a
corrective
his
experience
led
him
to
question
the
utility
of
nuns
and
priests
in
the
prostitutes
prison
he
does
not
think
they
do
any
good
and
inclines
to
the
belief
that
the
counsels
and
visits
of
married
women
who
look
rather
to
the
moral
than
religious
reform
of
the
women
would
be
productive
of
more
benefit
the
old
practice
in
france
was
to
admit
visitors
to
the
prison
at
certain
hours
and
in
a
certain
room
but
this
was
found
to
be
productive
of
great
evils
the
scenes
in
the
visitors
room
were
outrageous
and
a
new
system
was
accordingly
adopted
no
one
was
allowed
to
visit
a
prostitute
but
a
relation
and
even
such
a
one
was
required
to
obtain
a
written
permit
from
the
prefecture
of
police
a
certain
number
of
prostitutes
are
sent
every
year
to
the
prison
of
denis
these
are
those
who
from
physical
or
mental
infirmities
such
as
fistula
cancer
incurable
organic
disease
idiocy
are
incapacitated
from
pursuing
their
calling
and
run
risk
of
starvation
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
of
these
are
sent
to
denis
in
the
course
of
the
year
the
mortality
among
them
there
is
not
less
than
per
cent
per
annum
until
a
few
years
ago
a
tax
was
levied
on
the
paris
prostitutes
for
the
support
of
the
dispensary
each
mistress
of
a
house
paid
twelve
francs
per
month
each
girl
living
alone
three
francs
per
month
a
fine
of
two
francs
was
also
laid
on
all
prostitutes
who
were
behind
their
time
in
visiting
the
dispensary
the
product
of
these
various
taxes
amounted
to
from
to
ninety
thousand
francs
per
annum
the
system
was
abolished
on
the
ground
of
its
immorality
a
popular
notion
is
said
to
have
prevailed
that
the
police
received
half
a
million
or
more
from
the
tax
on
prostitution
and
attacks
on
the
administration
in
consequence
were
incessant
the
police
authorities
gave
way
at
last
and
the
municipal
council
of
the
city
undertook
to
defray
the
cost
of
the
dispensary
for
the
future
similar
taxes
appear
to
have
existed
at
lyons
strasbourg
and
other
cities
allusion
has
been
made
to
inspectors
at
the
time
wrote
there
were
ten
inspectors
who
had
each
charge
of
one
tenth
of
the
city
their
business
was
to
see
that
the
regulations
governing
prostitutes
were
carried
out
they
arrested
offending
women
and
transferred
them
to
the
prefecture
of
police
in
case
of
resistance
they
summoned
the
aid
of
the
ordinary
police
of
the
ward
they
were
not
allowed
themselves
to
use
violence
either
to
arrest
or
drag
a
girl
to
prison
they
were
usually
picked
men
of
good
character
their
salary
was
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
besides
handsome
presents
in
conclusion
a
word
must
be
said
of
the
establishment
called
the
it
is
a
magdalen
asylum
established
many
years
ago
by
some
benevolent
ladies
and
now
mainly
supported
by
an
annual
vote
from
the
city
of
paris
and
an
allowance
from
the
hospitals
it
receives
prostitutes
who
desire
to
reform
feeds
clothes
and
instructs
them
provides
them
with
places
when
they
desire
to
leave
or
with
work
when
they
wish
to
remain
in
the
establishment
the
rule
is
that
no
prostitute
can
be
received
under
eighteen
or
over
years
of
age
beyond
these
limits
it
has
been
found
that
the
humane
efforts
of
the
directresses
of
the
establishment
have
rarely
led
to
any
result
no
compulsion
is
used
in
any
case
by
the
managers
girls
are
free
to
leave
as
they
are
free
to
come
so
long
as
they
remain
however
they
must
conform
to
the
rules
of
the
establishment
which
are
strict
without
being
monastic
the
average
admissions
to
the
asylum
for
the
first
twelve
years
of
its
existence
were
twenty
per
annum
the
mortality
among
the
residents
was
very
large
being
equal
to
twenty
per
cent
on
the
total
number
during
the
twelve
years
of
the
whole
number
two
hundred
and
forty
were
dismissed
for
insubordination
left
of
their
own
accord
and
probably
returned
to
their
old
courses
and
fifteen
were
returned
to
the
police
the
remainder
were
either
restored
to
their
families
or
placed
in
situations
in
the
hospitals
or
elsewhere
small
as
these
numbers
appear
in
comparison
with
the
large
army
of
prostitutes
exercising
their
calling
at
paris
it
is
not
at
all
doubtful
but
the
establishment
is
a
useful
one
no
one
can
help
but
concur
with
when
he
observes
that
did
it
not
exist
it
would
be
necessary
to
create
it
as
has
written
the
best
we
might
almost
say
the
only
philosophical
work
on
prostitution
extant
it
may
be
useful
to
subjoin
the
test
of
the
statute
which
he
proposed
to
regulate
the
subject
of
prostitution
law
relative
to
the
repression
of
prostitution
the
duty
of
repressing
prostitution
whether
with
provocation
on
the
public
highway
or
otherwise
is
intrusted
at
paris
to
the
prefect
of
police
and
in
all
the
other
of
france
to
the
mayors
respectively
a
discretionary
authority
over
all
persons
engaged
in
public
prostitution
is
vested
in
these
functionaries
within
the
scope
of
their
powers
shall
constitute
evidence
of
public
prostitution
either
direct
provocation
thereto
on
the
public
highway
public
notoriety
or
legal
proof
adduced
after
accusation
and
trial
the
prefect
of
police
at
paris
and
the
mayors
in
the
other
shall
make
any
and
all
regulations
which
they
may
deem
suitable
for
the
repression
of
prostitution
and
such
regulations
shall
bear
upon
all
those
who
encourage
prostitution
as
a
trade
lodgers
and
landlords
and
tenants
the
dispensary
at
paris
for
the
superintendence
of
women
of
the
town
is
placed
on
the
same
footing
as
the
public
health
establishments
other
similar
dispensaries
may
be
established
wherever
they
are
needed
a
full
report
of
the
proceedings
of
these
dispensaries
shall
be
forwarded
annually
to
the
minister
of
the
interior
duchatelet
conceived
this
short
law
to
be
adequate
for
the
purpose
it
may
be
presumed
that
he
took
for
granted
that
the
mayors
of
the
would
never
attempt
to
carry
out
original
views
of
their
own
on
the
subject
he
doubtless
gave
them
credit
for
sufficient
to
adopt
without
question
the
elaborate
and
sensible
plan
which
experience
has
taught
the
authorities
of
paris
how
far
this
assumption
was
justifiable
appears
uncertain
in
view
of
the
fact
that
at
lyons
and
strasbourg
the
prostitutional
system
has
always
differed
from
that
of
the
capital
in
both
those
cities
a
tax
has
been
levied
on
prostitutes
till
a
very
late
period
at
lyons
it
was
exacted

by
lord
foundling
true
character
of
italian
people
of
modern
art
and
literature
dowered
with
the
fatal
heritage
of
beauty
italy
in
the
varied
passages
of
her
career
among
the
nations
has
been
as
remarkable
for
the
vice
and
sensuality
of
her
children
as
she
has
been
eminent
for
their
talents
and
acquirements
the
heart
of
the
historical
student
thrills
with
respectful
sympathy
over
the
sorrows
and
ennobling
virtues
of
her
patriots
in
all
ages
or
his
intellect
is
captivated
with
enthusiastic
admiration
and
reverence
in
considering
the
monuments
of
resplendent
genius
given
to
mankind
by
her
sons
let
him
turn
the
page
and
his
soul
recoils
in
disgust
and
deepest
horror
from
the
narrative
of
corruption
the
most
abandoned
ambition
the
most
unscrupulous
lust
the
most
abominable
crime
the
most
tremendous
to
which
the
history
of
the
world
scarcely
offers
a
parallel
and
which
brands
the
perpetrators
with
the
execration
of
all
succeeding
generations
the
most
glorious
era
of
the
italian
republics
immediately
preceded
their
downfall
like
shining
lights
they
perished
by
their
own
effulgence
the
mutual
jealousies
of
florence
pisa
genoa
lucca
and
the
numerous
independent
cities
and
states
stirred
up
in
them
a
noble
and
emulous
rage
to
excel
each
other
in
the
encouragement
they
gave
to
art
and
letters
and
the
mighty
works
produced
by
their
respective
citizens
but
the
same
sentiment
also
roused
them
to
deadlier
feuds
and
the
common
field
of
national
patriotism
being
shut
up
they
exhausted
themselves
and
each
other
by
struggles
and
incredible
sacrifices
of
blood
and
treasure
thus
they
paved
the
way
to
the
introduction
of
the
foreigner
and
the
mercenary
who
completed
their
ruin
until
in
place
of
the
small
but
illustrious
republics
which
formed
a
diadem
of
brightest
gems
arose
a
system
of
petty
tyrants
who
plunged
the
country
into
misery
and
degradation
these
in
turn
were
swept
away
by
the
strong
arm
of
a
despotism
which
has
never
since
relaxed
its
grasp
of
this
loveliest
country
of
the
earth
no
influence
played
a
more
important
part
in
bringing
about
this
catastrophe
than
that
of
the
court
of
rome
by
the
intrigues
of
the
roman
pontiffs
the
mutual
jealousies
of
the
states
were
exacerbated
and
their
quarrels
fomented
while
these
results
were
caused
by
the
political
actions
of
the
popes
and
their
advisers
the
worst
effects
were
produced
upon
public
manners
and
morals
by
their
example
the
abuses
which
had
established
themselves
among
the
roman
hierarchy
were
the
natural
consequences
of
long
and
undisturbed
enjoyment
by
the
clergy
of
their
vast
immunities
and
privileges
the
demoralization
and
dissoluteness
which
thus
existed
and
which
spread
its
poison
throughout
the
civilized
world
but
especially
throughout
italy
are
attested
to
posterity
by
all
contemporary
writers
the
enormous
iniquity
which
distinguished
such
men
as
john
sextus
or
alexander
is
notorious
to
all
although
the
character
of
communities
is
not
to
be
inferred
from
the
actions
of
exceptional
prodigies
either
of
virtue
or
vice
it
is
evident
that
the
system
which
could
place
monsters
like
these
in
the
august
positions
they
filled
must
have
been
rotten
to
the
core
the
worth
of
a
leo
or
a
clement
vii
consisted
in
the
absence
of
the
grosser
vices
rather
than
in
any
positive
excellence
and
the
encouragement
given
by
such
men
to
objectionable
practices
did
more
to
confirm
a
laxity
of
morals
than
the
odious
and
unpardonable
offenses
of
their
predecessors
some
of
the
political
profligacy
of
the
court
of
rome
and
through
its
example
of
the
other
italian
courts
was
owing
to
the
system
which
had
sprung
up
of
each
pope
providing
for
his
family
the
term
nephew
was
in
common
use
as
expressing
the
relationship
which
existed
between
the
pope
and
the
individuals
selected
for
advancement
the
priests
of
all
denominations
had
nephews
and
nieces
to
provide
for
and
the
abuses
covered
by
the
term
were
objects
of
the
keenest
satire
in
fact
innocent
viii
thus
provided
for
eight
openly
avowed
sons
and
daughters
the
obligations
of
sextus
iv
were
also
well
known
other
popes
whose
sins
were
not
in
this
particular
direction
having
no
sons
adopted
a
nephew
and
one
or
two
feeling
the
want
of
ties
of
kindred
or
family
relationship
actually
adopted
strangers
in
one
instance
the
donna
olimpia
a
niece
by
marriage
and
a
lady
of
ability
and
a
manly
spirit
took
the
place
of
a
nephew
in
the
court
of
innocent
without
any
imputation
on
the
character
of
either
pope
or
niece
the
effect
produced
by
this
example
in
high
places
particularly
upon
the
clergy
and
through
them
on
the
community
can
be
imagined
by
a
decree
of
the
church
in
the
eleventh
session
of
the
lateran
council
it
appears
that
the
clergy
were
accustomed
to
live
in
a
state
of
public
concubinage
nay
more
to
allow
others
to
do
so
for
money
paid
to
them

permission

the

compelled
some
attention
to
morals
among
the
clergy
and
for
a
time
an
earnest
endeavor
was
made
at
a
purification
of
the
church
this
was
one
of
the
chief
labors
of
the
famous
council
of
trent
that
council
certainly
did
repress
the
abuses
among
the
general
clergy
but
the
were
they
could
not
touch
the
cardinals
archbishops
or
the
pope
himself
and
thus
little
radical
change
was
effected
among
the
chief
dignitaries
there
are
not
wanting
writers
who
acquit
the
italian
national
character
of
blame
in
the
matter
attributing
the
general
corruption
partly
to
the
frightful
example
of
foreign
invaders
the
invasion
of
charles
himself
a
dissolute
monarch
with
the
universal
licentiousness
of
the
french
troops
did
undoubtedly
contribute
largely
to
ruin
the
morals
of
the
people
at
large
but
to
use
the
words
of
machiavelli
if
the
papal
court
were
removed
to
switzerland
the
simplest
and
most
religious
people
of
europe
would
in
an
incredibly
short
time
have
become
utterly
depraved
by
the
vicious
example
of
the
italian
priesthood
the
ecclesiastics
did
not
confine
themselves
to
licentiousness
of
conduct
the
clerical
writers
are
charged
with
a
taste
for
that
lowest
practice
of
debased
minds
obscenity
in
which
particular
they
exceed
the
lay
writers
roscoe
an
accomplished
italian
scholar
and
a
man
not
given
to
railing
maintains
this
allegation
this
reminds
us
of
pope
lines
immodest
words
admit
of
no
defense
for
want
of
decency
is
want
of
sense
for
the
limited
range
of
our
present
subject
history
so
profuse
of
illustration
of
war
bloodshed
and
the
personal
adventures
of
men
noteworthy
by
their
position
or
character
is
exceedingly
chary
of
materials
in
the
case
of
italy
the
testimony
as
to
the
morals
of
men
in
high
places
is
superabundant
and
these
and
the
legislative
enactments
of
the
period
will
furnish
some
of
the
information
of
which
we
are
in
search
in
the
fifteenth
century
charles
in
his
wars
to
gain
naples
from
the
spaniards
drew
down
unspeakable
miseries
upon
the
wretched
italians
his
armies
are
reputed
to
have
indulged
in
every
excess
of
unbridled
license
and
rapine
and
it
was
during
the
siege
of
naples
that
the
venereal
disease
is
said
to
have
first
made
its
appearance
although
the
particulars
given
of
this
malady
in
chapter
under
the
head
of
france
show
that
syphilis
existed
in
naples
two
or
three
years
before
the
siege
as
generally
happens
with
new
diseases
whether
from
fear
or
ignorance
of
the
means
to
control
them
it
was
represented
that
the
affliction
was
of
a
malignity
never
since
known
its
frightful
ravages
and
disgusting
character
impressed
the
minds
of
men
with
a
belief
that
it
was
a
new
scourge
sent
specially
as
a
punishment
for
the
debauchery
and
prostitution
of
the
period
each
party
retorting
on
the
other
the
charge
of
having
introduced
it
and
styling
it
or
de
according
to
the
nation
to
which
they
belonged
no
class
seems
to
have
been
exempt
from
it
sextus

of

of
the
wealthiest
and
most
dissolute
ecclesiastics
of
the
age
was
rotten
from
his
middle
to
the
soles
of
his
feet
even
the
haughty
and
majestic
julius
ii
would
not
expose
his
feet
to
the
obeisance
of
the
faithful
because
they
were
discolored
by
the
morbus
gallicus
leo
his
accomplished
and
munificent
successor
was
said
to
have
owed
his
elevation
to
the
fact
that
he
was
in
such
a
depraved
state
of
body
as
to
render
necessary
a
surgical
operation
in
the
consistorium
while
the
election
was
proceeding
the
cardinals
selecting
the
most
sickly
candidate
for
the
papal
tiara
an
unequivocal
allusion
to
the
pursuits
is
found
in
an
honorary
inscription
to

on
his
entrance
into

of

charles
indeed
is
by
some
authors
asserted
to
have
been
actually
the
first
who
introduced
the
venereal
disease
into
italy
an
eccentric
trophy
of
public
license
is
to
be
found
in
the
poem
of
fracastoro
a
physician
and
accomplished
writer
a
really
elegant
production
under
the
title
of
syphilis
the
argument
of
it
is
drawn
from
the
sufferings
of
syphilus
a
shepherd
who
has
been
punished
by
apollo
with
a
malignant
disease
for
impiety
in
this
work
the
author
introduces
the
reader
to
the
inner
regions
of
the
earth
to
the
mines
minerals
and
attendant
sprites
and
explains
the
discovery
of
mercury
and
its
beneficent
and
healing
influences
on
the
invalid
who
once
cured
is
enjoined
to
pay
his
vows
to
diana
in
that
turbulent
and
reprobate
artist
benvenuto
cellini
in
his
autobiography
one
of
the
most
spirited
representations
of
national
manners
extant
gives
an
account
of
a
syphilitic
disease
which
he
contracted
from
a
courtesan
he
says
little
of
the
mode
of
cure
but
it
is
evident
from
the
above
that
the
use
of
mercury
was
known
at
a
very
early
period
after
public
attention
was
generally
directed
to
the
disorder
the
excesses
of
this
iron
age
were
not
limited
to
ordinary
licentiousness
crimes
against
nature
seem
to
have
been
prevalent
and
are
even
alleged
to
have
been
a
source
of
revenue
in
a
collection
of
papal
lives
which
has
fallen
under
our
notice
but
which
is
not
very
particular
in
giving
its
authorities
we
find
it
stated
that
a
memorial
was
presented
to
sextus
iv
by
certain
individuals
of
the
family
of
the
cardinal
of
lucia
for
an
indulgence
to
commit
sodomy
and
that
the
pope
wrote
at
the
bottom
of
it
the
usual
the
case
of
beatrice
cenci
is
better
attested
every
one
recollects
the
accumulated
horrors
of
the
story
the
father
hating
his
children
his
wife
all
mankind
introduces
prostitutes
to
his
house
and
debauches
his
daughter
beatrice
by
force
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
bishop
she
procures
him
to
be
murdered
and
with
her
was
executed
for
the
crime
the
pope
refusing
to
show
any
mercy
the
count
cenci
had
been
addicted
to
unnatural
offenses
and
had
thrice
compounded
with
the
papal
government
for
his
crimes
by
paying
an
enormous
sum
of
money
and
the
narrator
says
that
the
acrimony
of
the
pope
toward
the
wretched
daughter
was
for
having
cut
off
a
profitable
source
of
revenue
in
naples
the
laws
on
the
subject
of
prostitution
were
extremely
severe
previous
to
the
thirteenth
century
every
procuress
endeavoring
to
corrupt
innocent
females
was
punished
like
an
adulteress
by
mutilation
of
her
nose
the
mother
who
prostituted
her
daughter
suffered
this
punishment
until
king
frederick
absolved
such
women
as
trafficked
with
their
children
from
the
pressure
of
want
the
same
prince
however
decreed
against
all
who
were
found
guilty
of
preparing
drugs
or
inflammatory
liquors
to
aid
in
their
designs
upon
virtuous
females
death
in
case
of
injuries
resulting
from
their
acts
and
imprisonment
when
no
serious
harm
was
effected
these
laws
proved
insufficient
for
their
purpose
and
toward
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
profligacy
ran
riot
in
naples
ruffiani
multiplied
in
its
streets
procuring
by
force
or
corruption
multitudes
of
victims
to
fill
the
taverns
and
brothels
of
the
city
penalties
of
extreme
severity
were
proclaimed
against
them
the
ruffiani
were
ordered
to
quit
the
kingdom
and
prostitutes
were
prohibited
from
harboring
such
persons
among
them
any
woman
who
disobeyed
was
condemned
to
be
burned
in
the
forehead
with
an
iron
whipped
in
the
most
humiliating
manner
and
exiled
under
king
roger
a
charge
of
seduction
was
never
taken
but
william
the
successor
of
that
prince
punished
with
death
the
crime
of
rape
the
victim
however
was
required
to
prove
that
she
had
shrieked
aloud
and
that
she
had
preferred
her
complaint
within
eight
days
or
that
she
had
been
detained
by
force
when
once
a
woman
had
prostituted
herself
she
had
no
right
to
refuse
to
yield
her
person
to
any
one
in
naples
prostitutes
in
spite
of
the
law
passed
to
confine
brothels
to
particular
quarters
established
themselves
in
the
most
beautiful
streets
of
the
city
in
palatial
buildings
and
there
with
incessant
clamor
congregated
a
horde
of
thieves
profligates
and
vagabonds
of
every
kind
until
the
chief
quarter
became
uninhabitable
in
they
were
ordered
to
quit
the
street
of
catalana
within
eight
days
under
pain
of
the
scourge
for
the
women
the
galleys
for
such
of
the
proprietors
as
were
commoners
while
simple
banishment
was
declared
against
the
nobles
one
example
of
good
legislation
was
the
pragmatic
law
of
to
protect
unfortunate
women
against
the
cupidity
the
extortions
and
the
frauds
of
and
others
men
were
in
the
habit
of
going
into
places
of
amusement
with
single
girls
contracting
a
heavy
debt
and
then
leaving
their
victims
to
pay
these
were
then
given
the
choice
of
a
disgraceful
whipping
or
an
engagement
in
the
house
they
often
consented
and
spent
the
remainder
of
their
days
in
dependence
on
their
creditors
without
ability
to
liberate
themselves
by
the
new
law
masters
of
taverns
were
forbidden
to
give
credit
to
prostitutes
for
more
than
a
certain
sum
and
this
only
to
supply
them
with
food
and
clothing
absolutely
necessary
if
they
exceeded
this
amount
they
had
no
means
of
legal
recovery
the
most
remarkable
feature
in
neapolitan
legislation
on
this
subject
was
the
establishment
at
an
unknown
but
early
date
of
the
court
of
prostitutes
this
tribunal
which
sat
at
naples
had
its
peculiar
constitution
and
had
jurisdiction
over
all
cases
connected
with
prostitution
blasphemy
and
some
other
infamous
offenses
toward
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
had
risen
to
extraordinary
power
and
was
prolific
of
abuses
it
practiced
all
kinds
of
exaction
and
violence
every
species
of
partiality
and
injustice
and
even
presumed
to
promulgate
edicts
of
its
own
the
judges
flung
into
prison
numbers
of
young
girls
whom
they
compelled
to
buy
their
liberty
with
money
and
sometimes
even
dared
to
seize
women
who
though
of
lax
conduct
could
not
be
included
in
the
professional
class
this
was
discovered
and
led
to
a
reform
of
the
court
in
its
powers
were
strictly
defined
and
its
form
of
procedure
placed
under
regulation
while
the
avenues
to
corruption
were
narrowed
the
institution
existed
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
after
this
in
rome
in
the
eleventh
century
a
brothel
and
a
church
stood
side
by
side
and
five
hundred
years
after
under
the
pontificate
of
paul
prostitutes
were
numerous
statutes
were
enacted
and
many
precautions
taken
which
prove
the
grossness
of
manners
at
that
epoch
one
convicted
of
selling
a
girl
to
infamy
was
heavily
fined
and
if
he
did
not
pay
within
ten
days
had
one
foot
cut
off
the
nobility
and
common
people
alike
indulged
habitually
in
all
kinds
of
excess
tortures
floggings
brandings
banishment
were
inflicted
on
some
to
terrify
others
but
with
very
incomplete
success
to
carry
off
and
detain
a
prostitute
against
her
will
was
punished
by
amputation
of
the
right
hand
imprisonment
flogging
or
exile
the
rich
however
invariably
bought
immunity
for
themselves
among
the
most
extraordinary
acts
of
legislation
on
this
subject
was
the
bull
of
clement
who
desired
to
endow
the
church
with
the
surplus
gains
of
the
brothel
every
person
guilty
of
prostitution
was
forced
when
disposing
of
her
property
either
at
death
or
during
life
to
assign
half
of
it
to
a
convent
this
regulation
was
easily
eluded
and
proved
utterly
inefficacious
a
tribunal
was
also
established
having
jurisdiction
over
brothels
upon
which
a
tax
was
laid
continuing
in
existence
until
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
efforts
were
made
to
confine
this
class
of
dwellings
to
a
particular
quarter
but
without
success
in
some
of
the
italian
states
as
in
lombardy
men
were
forbidden
to
give
prostitutes
an
asylum
they
were
prohibited
from
appearing
among
honest
citizens
and
were
prevented
from
purchasing
clothes
or
food
and
from
borrowing
money
by
the
hire
of
their
persons
after
a
time
however
a
system
of
licensed
brothels
in
imitation
of
the
institutions
founded
at
toulouse
and
montpellier
was
introduced
into
parts
of
italy
and
the
brothels
became
very
numerous
there
was
one
at
mantua
and
venice
was
a
very
sink
of
prostitution
in
the
government
enlisted
women
in
this
service
to
guard
the
virtue
of
the
other
classes
a
matron
was
placed
over
them
who
governed
them
received
their
gains
and
made
a
monthly
division
of
profit
the
names
of
several
women
the
most
notorious
and
beautiful
of
the
venetian
courtesans
are
preserved
by
nicolo
daglioni
a
very
small
sum
was
paid
them
by
their
patrons
the
laws
regulating
prostitution
and
prostitutes
seem
to
have
had
a
wonderful
similarity
throughout
europe
among
other
enactments
were
those
regulating
clothing
which
were
at
one
time
promulgated
in
every
state
some
of
these
were
sumptuary
and
merely
prohibited
the
wearing
of
fashionable
attire
others
directed
particular
costumes
as
a
badge
of
the
prostitute
calling
and
to
distinguish
them
in
public
from
women
at
mantua
prostitutes
when
they
appeared
in
the
streets
were
ordered
to
cover
the
rest
of
their
clothes
with
a
short
white
cloak
and
wear
a
badge
on
their
breast
at
bergamo
the
cloak
was
yellow
in
parma
white
in
milan
at
first
black
woolen
cloth
and
then
black
silk
if
disobedient
they
might
be
fined
and
in
case
of
a
second
offense
whipped
and
any
one
might
strip
off
the
garment
of
a
girl
illegally
attired
in
the
duchy
of
asola
in
piedmont
a
regulation
was
established
that
a
mother
could
disinherit
her
daughter
for
leading
a
vicious
life
but
she
lost
this
privilege
if
it
was
proved
that
she
had
connived
at
her
immorality
the
father
had
equal
authority
but
with
one
curious
limitation
when
says
the
law
a
father
has
sought
to
marry
his
daughter
and
has
endowed
her
sufficiently
if
she
refuses
to
marry
and
becomes
a
prostitute
he
may
cut
her
off
but
if
he
have
opposed
her
marriage
until
she
has
reached
the
age
of
and
she
then
become
a
libertine
he
can
not
refuse
to
bequeath
her
his
property
and
the
woman
on
every
opportunity
to
marry
is
bound
to
present
herself
before
her
father
and
demand
his
consent
if
he
refused
it
he
was
not
allowed
to
punish
her
in
cases
where
at
the
age
of
thirty
she
became
a
harlot
the
efforts
to
root
out
prostitution
from
houses
and
neighborhoods
in
italy
had
as
elsewhere
the
result
of
driving
loose
women
to
places
of
public
resort
the
baths
were
regularly
frequented
in
every
city
in
the
peninsula
hence
the
use
of
the
word
as
expressive
of
a
disreputable
place
so
that
there
was
scarcely
a
who
was
not
also
a
in
avignon
which
in
consequence
of
the
schism
of
the
popes
may
be
considered
a
second
rome
a
statute
of
the
church
in
interdicted
to
the
priests
and
clergy
the
use
of
certain
baths
notorious
as
brothels
the
license
of
prostitution
was
soon
taken
away
in
avignon
the
residence
of
the
popes
in
that
city
had
attracted
a
concourse
of
strangers
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
and
brothels
sprung
up
at
the
doors
of
the
churches
and
close
to
the
papal
residence
and
bishops
palaces
they
brought
so
much
scandal
on
the
community
that
an
edict
was
passed
driving
prostitutes
out
of
the
city
in
endeavoring
to
investigate
the
condition
of
prostitution
in
modern
italy
our
inquiries
and
researches
have
been
almost
profitless
from
the
dearth
of
reliable
statistical
information
as
to
any
part
of
that
most
interesting
country
in
the
fine
arts
and
in
certain
departments
of
abstract
science
the
republic
of
letters
can
show
numerous
records
of
italy
state
and
progress
in
all
that
tells
of
the
people
their
condition
their
relations
to
each
other
and
their
rulers
the
statements
of
writers
both
native
and
foreign
are
so
contradictory
so
imbued
with
party
passions
and
prejudices
or
so
flippantly
careless
and
inaccurate
that
we
must
peruse
them
with
constant
suspicion
at
the
same
time
official
documents
are
so
sparingly
given
to
the
world
that
it
is
hopeless
to
fall
back
upon
them
it
is
customary
to
think
and
speak
of
italy
like
germany
as
a
whole
in
reality
however
a
wide
difference
prevails
among
the
inhabitants
of
piedmont
tuscany
and
austrian
italy
the
papal
states
and
naples
rome
though
not
the
political
capital
of
italy
must
be
considered
the
capital
in
virtue
of
her
papal
court
her
past
traditions
and
her
large
concourse
of
foreigners
but
even
her
manners
scarcely
give
the
tone
to
the
remainder
of
the
country
in
rome
prostitution
is
tolerated
though
not
legally
permitted
there
are
no
statistics
from
which
the
number
of
prostitutes
can
be
calculated
at
one
time
there
were
said
to
be
five
thousand
of
these
unfortunates
in
the
city
but
this
estimate
is
only
another
sample
of
the
carelessness
which
is
to
be
observed
in
writers
on
this
subject
under
paul
iv
there
were
only
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
forty
years
after
they
had
increased
to
one
hundred
thousand
public
prostitutes
are
now
as
rarely
seen
in
the
streets
of
rome
as
in
those
of
other
italian
cities
it
is
said
also
that
there
are
scarcely
any
public
brothels
there
is
a
law
that
a
woman
guilty
of
adultery
shall
be
imprisoned
for
three
months
but
italian
usages
are
averse
to
legal
proceedings
the
scandal
is
offensive
to
society
besides
the
courts
require
positive
proof
of
the
offense
with
regard
to
seduction
the
laws
are
equally
stringent
but
such
cases
when
brought
to
notice
are
usually
compromised
by
permission
of
the
authorities
either
by
payment
of
a
sum
of
money
or
by
marriage
syphilis
is
always
of
considerable
extent
in
rome
and
the
venereal
ward
in
san
jacomo
is
always
full

the
siege

by

there
are
in
rome
nineteen
hospitals
for
the
treatment
of
the
sick
in
eight
public
hospitals
the
average
number
of
patients
daily
is
about
fourteen

the

for

the
albergo

the
finest
in
italy
it
accommodates
upward
of
three
thousand
paupers
of

provided
with
workshops
and
schools
so
as
to
afford
suitable
employment
and

of

utterly

to

of
the

they
can
gain
by
begging

bask
in

sun
all

on

on

with
the
utmost
complacency
an
epicurean
might
find
in
this
abnegation
of
the
cares
of
life
a
sound
practical
philosophy
that
such
a
class
is
in
the
highest
degree
obnoxious
to
society
must
be
apparent
to
every
one
in
the
famous
rising
of
cardinal
ruffo
at
the
time
of
the
french
occupation
in
the
lazaroni
perpetrated
the
most
frightful
excesses
and
are
said
to
have
been
relied
on
by
the
imbecile
bourbon
government
as
their
chief
friends
and
supporters
against
the
dangers
of
french
republicanism
modern
progress
has
drawn
even
naples
and
the
lazaroni
within
its
magic
circle
and
an
accomplished
traveler
expresses
doubts
of
their
alleged
unconquerable
laziness
for
he
has
seen
them
work
wear
clothes
sleep
at
home
earn
money
when
they
had
a
chance
and
conduct
themselves
very
much
like
other
people
perhaps
as
with
the
irish
a
want
of
fair
remuneration
may
be
at
the
root
of
their
idleness
a
singular
institution
of
italian
society
is
the
or
this
is
a
distant
male
relative
or
friend
who
invariably
attends
a
married
lady
on
all
occasions
of
her
appearance
in
public
he
pays
her
all
conceivable
attentions
and
performs
even
the
most
servile
offices
carries
her
fan
her
parasol
or
her
lapdog
we
are
not
aware
that
any
foreigner
has
been
able
to
settle
this
anomaly
of
social
life
to
his
satisfaction
the
italians
themselves
sometimes
maintain
that
there
is
no
immorality
or
impropriety
in
the
arrangement
that
it
is
a
matter
of
etiquette
in
which
the
heart
is
in
no
way
concerned
the
husband
is
perfectly
cognizant
of
it
and
the
appearance
of
the
cicisbeo
with
the
lady
is
more
than
that
of
her
husband
originally
there
can
be
very
little
question
that
the
institution
was
of
an
amorous
character
and
the
parties
met
privately
at
the
casini
where
certain
apartments
were
specially
dedicated
to
the
use
of
the
ladies
and
their
cavalieri
with
the
french
occupation
of
the
custom
became
the
subject
of
immoderate
raillery
and
satire
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
it
has
been
but
partially
revived
in
place
however
of
the
cicisbeo
or
cavaliere
servente
whose
services
and
attentions
were
a
form
of
society
it
is
we
fear
undeniable
that
more
intimate
though
less
avowed
relations
exist
between
many
italian
ladies
and
other
men
than
their
husbands
that
there
are
numerous
and
admirable
exceptions
to
the
rule
if
it
be
a
rule
we
freely
admit
but
unless
the
concurrent
testimony
of
all
writers
and
travelers
in
italy
be
absolutely
false
and
either
basely
slanderous
or
culpably
careless
the
marriage
vow
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
cloak
for
a
license
that
is
inadmissible
to
the
unmarried
woman
the
testimony
of
a
profligate
man
is
rarely
to
be
taken
against
women
and
though
the
witness
be
a
lord
and
a
poet
we
do
not
know
that
this
should
make
a
difference
were
the
case
one
of
mere
abuse
coupled
however
as
the
inculpation
is
with
extenuatory
remarks
we
think
lord
observations
valuable
in
a
letter
to
murray
the
celebrated
london
publisher
february
he
says
you
ask
me
for
a
volume
of
manners
in
italy
perhaps
i
am
in
the
case
to
know
more
of
them
than
most
englishmen
i
have
lived
in
their
houses
and
in
the
heart
of
their
families
sometimes
merely
as
di
and
sometimes
as
di
of
the
and
in
neither
case
do
i
feel
justified
in
making
a
book
of
them
their
moral
is
not
your
moral
their
life
is
not
your
life
you
would
not
understand
it
it
is
not
english
nor
french
nor
german
which
you
would
all
understand
i
know
not
how
to
make
you
comprehend
a
people
who
are
at
once
temperate
and
profligate
serious
in
their
characters
and
buffoons
in
their
amusements
capable
of
impressions
and
passions
which
are
at
once
sudden
and
durable
i
should
know
something
of
the
matter
having
had
a
pretty
general
experience
among
their
women
from
the
fisherman
wife
up
to
the
whom
i
serve
they
are
extremely
tenacious
and
jealous
as
furies
not
permitting
their
lovers
even
to
marry
if
they
can
help
it
and
keeping
them
always
to
them
in
public
as
in
private
the
reason
is
that
they
marry
for
their
parents
and
love
for
themselves
they
exact
fidelity
from
a
lover
as
a
debt
of
honor
while
they
pay
the
husband
as
a
tradesman
you
hear
a
person
character
male
or
female
canvassed
not
as
depending
on
their
conduct
to
their
husbands
or
wives
but
to
their
mistress
or
lover
if
i
wrote
a
quarto
i
know
that
i
could
do
more
than
amplify
what
i
have
here
noted
it
is
to
be
observed
that
while
they
do
all
this
the
greatest
outward
respect
is
to
be
paid
to
the
husbands
not
only
by
the
ladies
but
by
their
particularly
if
the
husband
serve
no
one
himself
which
is
not
often
the
case
however
so
that
you
would
often
suppose
them
relations
the
making
the
figure
of
one
adopted
in
the
family
sometimes
the
ladies
run
a
little
restive
and
elope
or
divide
or
make
a
scene
but
this
is
at
the
starting
generally
when
they
know
no
better
or
when
they
fall
in
love
with
a
foreigner
or
some
such
anomaly
and
is
always
reckoned
unnecessary
and
extravagant
as
a
counterpoise
to
these
opinions
of
lord
byron
it
is
but
fair
to
give
that
of
valery
a
traveler
whose
personal
opportunities
may
have
been
less
than
in
the
case
of
the
noble
poet
the
morals
of
the
italian
cities
which
we
still
judge
of
from
the
commonplace
reports
of
travelers
of
the
last
century
are
now
neither
better
nor
worse
than
those
of
other
capitals
perhaps
at
naples
they
are
even
better
the
countess
pepoli
a
lady
of
patriotic
and
literary
family
has
written
an
able
educational
manual
in
which
she
claims
consideration
for
the
number
of
good
and
virtuous
women
in
italy
whose
existence
is
ignored
by
the
prejudiced
writers
of
extravagant
diatribes
but
we
are
afraid
that
the
very
exception
and
the
pains
she
takes
to
prove
the
temptations
to
which
the
married
woman
is
exposed
only
affirm
the
truth
of
the
general
charge
whatever
allegations
of
veracious
or
exaggerated
unchastity
or
immorality
may
be
made
against
the
italians
they
are
generally
to
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
aristocracy
and
upper
classes
among
the
humbler
italians
the
peasantry
and
the
country
poor
there
is
no
ground
for
ascribing
to
them
either
greater
idleness
or
worse
morals
than
are
to
be
found
in
other
parts
of
europe
foundling
hospitals
are
to
be
met
with
in
most
great
cities
of
continental
europe
among
protestants
a
strong
prejudice
exists
against
these
institutions
that
they
prevent
infanticide
is
their
operation
as
an
encouragement
of
illicit
intercourse
can
not
be
estimated
without
some
minute
inquiries
into
the
illegitimacy
of
places
which
encourage
them
and
of
others
which
are
without
them
the
proportion
of
children
in
the
foundling
hospitals
of
italy
is
certainly
large
but
it
is
believed
on
good
grounds
that
a
considerable
number
of
them
are
legitimate
and
are
abandoned
by
their
parents
on
account
of
their
poverty
of
the
really
illegitimate
there
are
no
means
of
saying
with
accuracy
nor
as
far
as
we
know
have
any
attempts
been
made

we
have
already
alluded
to
the

of

the

chiefly
confined

between
the
ancient
spaniards
and
the
romans
a
most
intimate
connection
subsisted
from
an
early
period
of
the
roman
republic
and
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
former
bore
the
closest
resemblance
to
those
of
the
latter
this
affinity
continued
so
long
as
the
roman
empire
had
a
name
and
after
the
establishment
of
christianity
as
the
state
religion
the
ties
of
kindred
and
dependence
were
drawn
still
closer
for
the
spanish
kingdom
has
ever
been
the
favored
heritage
and
its
rulers
the
most
obedient
sons
of
rome
thus
the
maxims
of
the
roman
civil
law
were
early
incorporated
into
the
political
system
and
they
still
remain
the
chief
pillars
of
spanish
jurisprudence
accordingly
we
find
in
their
legislation
on
prostitution
that
the
spaniards
together
with
the
general
theories
adopted
the
specific
enactments
of
other
latin
nations
by
the
code
of
alphonse
in
the
twelfth
century
procurers
were
to
be
condemned
to
civil
death
such
offenders
were
thus
classified
men
who
trafficked
in
debauchery
these
were
to
be
banished
keepers
of
houses
of
accommodation
who
were
to
be
fined
and
their
houses
confiscated
who
hired
out
prostitutes
which
prostitutes
if
slaves
were
to
be
manumitted
if
free
were
to
be
dowried
at
the
cost
of
the
offenders
so
that
they
might
have
a
chance
of
marriage
husbands
conniving
at
the
prostitution
or
dishonor
of
their
wives
these
were
liable
to
capital
punishment
a
class
of
persons
styled
ruffiani
whence
the
modern
word
ruffian
these
latter
were
analogous
to
the
pimp
and
bully
of
the
present
day
and
from
the
repeated
and
very
severe
laws
against
them
seem
to
have
given
great
trouble
to
the
authorities
they
were
banished
flogged
imprisoned
in
short
got
rid
of
on
any
terms
girls
who
supported
them
were
publicly
whipped
and
the
general
laws
upon
the
matter
were
similar
to
those
noted
in
the
previous
chapter
on
italy
in
spain
the
profligacy
of
public
morals
attained
a
pitch
beyond
all
precedent
possibly
owing
in
some
measure
to
draconian
legislation
further
laws
were
from
time
to
time
passed
against
the
ruffiani
as
preceding
edicts
had
fallen
into
desuetude
and
their
presence
and
traffic
was
encouraged
by
the
prostitutes
these
latter
were
forbidden
to
harbor
the
men
and
on
breach
of
this
prohibition
were
to
be
branded
publicly
whipped
and
banished
the
kingdom
procurers
procuresses
and
adulteresses
were
punished
by
mutilation
of
the
nose
mothers
who
trafficked
in
their
children
virtue
under
pressure
of
extreme
were
also
liable
to
this
barbarous
punishment
in
and
edicts
were
again
passed
against
the
ruffiani
they
were
styled
a
highly
objectionable
class
dangerous
to
public
order
on
the
first
conviction
as
a
ruffiano
the
offender
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
at
the
galleys
for
a
second
conviction
he
received
two
hundred
blows
or
stripes
and
was
sent
to
the
galleys
for
life
up
to
this
time
the
court
of
spain
seems
to
have
been
almost
as
strongly
tinctured
with
licentiousness
as
those
of
other
nations
about
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
henry

the

was
greeted
by
the
festivities
and

pageants
which
belonged
to
the
age
of

in
her
own
country
joanna
had
been
ardently
beloved
in
the
land
of
her
adoption
her
light
and
lively
manners
gave
occasion

grossest
suspicions

most
favored
lover
he
was
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
the
kingdom
at
a
tournament
near
madrid
he
maintained
the
superior
beauty
of
his
mistress
against
all
comers
and
displayed
so
much
prowess
in
the
presence
of
the
king
as
induced
henry
to
commemorate
the
event
by
the
erection
of
a
monastery
dedicated
to
st
john
it
does
not
appear
however
whom
beltran
de
la
cueva
indicated
as
the
lady
of
his
love
on
this
occasion
two
anecdotes
may
be
mentioned
as
characteristic
of
the
gallantry
of
the
times
the
archbishop
of
seville
concluded
a
superb
given
in
honor
of
the
royal
nuptials
by
introducing
on
the
table
two
vases
filled
with
rings
garnished
with
precious
stones
to
be
distributed
among
his
female
guests
at
a
ball
given
on
another
occasion
the
young
queen
having
condescended
to
dance
with
the
french
embassador
the
latter
made
a
solemn
vow
in
commemoration
of
so
distinguished
an
honor
never
to
dance
with
any
other
woman
while
the
queen
levity
laid
her
open
to
suspicion
the
licentiousness
of
her
husband
was
undisguised
one
of
joanna
maids
of
honor
acquired
an
ascendency
over
henry
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
and
after
the
exhibition
of
some
disgraceful
scenes
the
palace
became
divided
by
the
factions
of
the
hostile
fair
ones
the
archbishop
of
seville
did
not
blush
to
espouse
the
cause
of
the
paramour
who
maintained
a
magnificence
of
state
which
rivaled
royalty
itself
the
public
were
still
more
scandalized
by
henry
sacrilegious
intrusion
of
another
of
his
mistresses
into
the
post
of
abbess
of
a
convent
in
toledo
after
the
expulsion
of
her
predecessor
a
lady
of
noble
rank
and
irreproachable
character
these
examples
of
corruption
influenced
alike
the
people
and
the
clergy
the
middle
class
imitated
their
superiors
and
indulged
in
an
excess
of
luxury
equally
demoralizing
and
ruinous
the
archbishop
of
james
was
hunted
from
his
see
by
the
indignant
populace
in
consequence
of
an
outrage
attempted
on
a
youthful
bride
as
she
was
returning
from
church
after
the
performance
of
the
nuptial
ceremony
under
the
reign
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
a
total
change
was
effected
they
both
exhibited
a
practical
wisdom
in
their
own
personal
relations
which
always
commands
respect
and
which
however
it
may
have
savored
of
worldly
policy
in
ferdinand
was
in
his
consort
founded
on
the
purest
and
most
exalted
principles
under
such
a
sovereign
the
court
which
had
been
little
better
than
a
brothel
in
the
preceding
reign
became
the
nursery
of
virtue
and
generous
ambition
isabella
watched
assiduously
over
the
nurture
of
the
damsels
of
the
court
whom
she
received
into
the
royal
palace
causing
them
to
be
educated
under
her
own
eye
and
endowing
them
with
liberal
portions
on
their
marriage
joanna
the
second
daughter
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
was
unfortunate
in
her
marriage
to
philip
son
of
the
archduke
maximilian
and
sovereign
in
right
of
his
mother
of
the
low
countries
the
couple
embarked
for
flanders
in
the
year
and
soon
after
their
arrival
the
inconstancy
of
the
husband
and
the
ungovernable
sensibility
of
the
wife
occasioned
some
scandalous
scenes
philip
was
openly
enamored
of
one
of
the
ladies
in
her
suite
and
his
injured
wife
in
a
paroxysm
of
jealousy
personally
assaulted
her
rival
and
caused
the
beautiful
locks
which
had
excited
the
admiration
of
her
fickle
husband
to
be
shorn
from
her
head
this
outrage
so
affected
philip
that
he
vented
his
indignation
against
joanna
in
the
coarsest
and
most
unmanly
terms
and
finally
refused
to
have
any
farther
intercourse
with
her
public
brothels
were
established
in
spain
as
in
other
countries
of
europe
one
of
great
extent
being
in
existence
in
valencia
in
the
fifteenth
century
it
constituted
a
complete
suburb
in
itself
similar
to
the
ghetto
or
jews
suburb
of
most
capital
cities
indeed
from
its
description
it
is
doubtful
if
it
was
not
a
rogue
sanctuary
similar
to
the
well
known
alsatia
in
london
it
was
surrounded
by
a
wall
with
one
gate
only
at
which
a
warder
was
stationed
he
was
a
public
city
officer
and
one
of
his
duties
was
to
warn
all
comers
of
the
risk
their
property
ran
in
visiting
such
a
place
if
they
wished
to
leave
valuables
in
his
care
they
could
do
so
and
receive
them
on
their
exit
there
were
some
hundreds
of
girls
resident
in
this
vast
den
of
iniquity
to
add
to
the
disgrace
of
the
locality
the
place
of
public
execution
was
at
its
gate
in
the
rents
profits
and
emoluments
of
the
public
brothels
of
seville
were
assigned
to
alonzo
fajardo
the
master
of
the
royal
table
in
there
is
an
enactment
in
granada
fixing
the
rents
to
be
paid
by
the
women
for
their
rooms
and
accommodation
in
public
brothels
and
also
detailing
the
furniture
and
food
with
which
they
were
to
be
provided
in
return
this
is
similar
to
the
minute
legislation
of
the
german
cities
this
public
provision
having
been
made
no
person
was
allowed
to
lend
these
women
the
authorities
of
various
cities
might
not
permit
a
prostitute
to
reside
in
the
town
without
previous
examination
by
a
duly
licensed
physician
who
was
to
declare
upon
oath
whether
the
woman
then
was
or
had
recently
been
diseased
by
some
of
the
spanish
laws
kept
mistresses
or
concubines
seem
to
have
been
a
legal
institution
for
men
of
rank
were
forbidden
to
take
procuresses
or
prostitutes
as
concubines
this
breach
of
the
ordinary
institutions
of
christianity
may
probably
have
been
a
compromise
of
moorish
and
christian
usages
and
morals
before
the
final
deadly
struggle
which
ended
in
the
expulsion
of
the
moors
intermarriages
were
not
uncommon
among
the
two
peoples
interchange
of
friendship
and
close
intimacy
existed
between
the
races
and
a
mutual
tolerance
of
each
other
laws
and
customs
was
maintained
except
by
the
enthusiasts
of
either
religion
the
spanish
jurists
distinctly
recognized
the
woman
right
to
recover
the
wages
of
her
infamy
the
scholiasts
struck
out
various
fine
distinctions
for
which
the
monkish
dialecticians
were
so
deservedly
ridiculed
by
the
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
these
were
debated
and
discussed
with
the
utmost
eagerness
one
question
was
whether
if
the
man
paid
beforehand
and
the
woman
refused
to
complete
the
contract
he
could
compel
her
the
weight
of
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
as
he
contemplated
an
immorality
he
could
neither
recover
the
money
nor
enforce
the
agreement
another
equally
important
point
was
the
use
to
which
the
gains
of
prostitution
might
be
lawfully
applied
the
legality
of
their
gains
would
seem
to
have
overridden
the
mode
of
their
expenditure
but
casuists
thought
otherwise
and
by
a
royal
edict
of
alphonse
it
was
decided
that
priests
could
not
receive
funds
obtained
from
such
impure
sources
by
the
old
spanish
law
prostitutes
were
subjected
to
various
disabilities
in
matters
of
inheritance
or
testamentary
disposition
as
mentioned
in
the
review
of
the
old
german
customs
the
church
considered
it
a
meritorious
act
to
marry
a
harlot
on
the
assumption
that
thereby
a
brand
was
saved
from
the
burning
it
is
related
of
a
young
man
that
while
being
led
to
the
scaffold
a
courtesan
struck
by
his
manly
beauty
and
bearing
offered
to
marry
him
whereby
in
virtue
of
a
law
or
usage
his
life
would
be
saved
he
rejected
her
proposition
as
existence
was
not
worth
redemption
at
such
a
price
it
is
added
that
his
life
was
nevertheless
spared
in
consideration
of
his
spirit
and
courage
in
by
order
of
philip
the
regulations
in
force
in
the
principal
towns
of
andalusia
were
extended
to
those
of
castile
by
these
it
was
enacted
that
a
woman
became
a
prostitute
of
her
own
free
will
and
that
no
one
could
compel
her
to
continue
such
even
though
she
had
incurred
debts
a
surgeon
was
directed
to
pay
her
a
weekly
visit
at
her
house
and
report
to
the
deputies
of
the
consistory
those
who
were
diseased
in
order
that
they
might
be
removed
to
hospital
the
keeper
of
a
brothel
could
not
receive
into
his
house
any
one
who
had
not
been
previously
examined
nor
allow
any
one
who
was
diseased
to
remain
there
under
a
fine
of
a
thousand
maravedis
with
thirty
days
imprisonment
each
room
was
to
contain
certain
furniture
and
the
house
was
to
be
closed
on
holidays
during
lent
ember
week
and
on
all
fast
days
under
a
punishment
of
a
hundred
stripes
to
each
woman
who
received
visitors
as
well
as
to
the
keeper
of
the
house
these
and
other
orders
were
to
be
hung
upon
different
parts
of
the
house
under
a
fine
about
six
dollars
and
eight
days
imprisonment
the
subject
of
venereal
disease
in
spain
has
acquired
some
interest
from
a
generally
received
opinion
that
its
appearance
was
made
in
that
country
whence
it
was
disseminated
throughout
europe
columbus
and
his
crew
were
reported
to
have
introduced
it
from
america
but
later
investigations
have
proved
that
syphilis
was
not
known
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
until
imported
by
europeans
facts
have
been
advanced
in
preceding
pages
showing
its
almost
simultaneous
appearance
in
italy
and
spain
and
we
recur
to
the
subject
now
merely
with
reference
to
the
theory
of
its
american
origin
a
late
work
sulla
storia
de
mali
venerei
di
domenice
thiene
enumerates
some
proofs
on
the
question
the
main
points
are
that
neither
columbus
nor
his
son
allude
in
any
way
to
such
a
disease
in
the
new
world
among
frequent
notices
of
the
disease
in
the
years
following
the
discovery
of
america
there
is
no
mention
of
its
originating
there
but
on
the
contrary
a
uniform
derivation
of
it
from
some
other
source
is
assigned
that
the
disorder
was
known
and
described
before
the
siege
of
naples
and
therefore
could
not
be
introduced
by
the
spaniards
at
that
time
that
it
was
known
in
a
variety
of
countries
in
and
the
early
part
of
a
rapidity
of
diffusion
irreconcilable
with
its
importation
by
columbus
in
that
the
first
work
professing
to
trace
its
origin
in
america
was
not
published
till
and
was
the
production
not
of
a
spaniard
but
a
foreigner
the
question
of
its
origin
is
more
definitely
settled
by
a
letter
of
peter
martyr
noticing
the
symptoms
in
the
most
unequivocal
manner
and
dated
april
about
five
years
before
the
return
of
columbus
some
doubts
have
been
thrown
upon
the
accuracy
of
this
letter
but
they
do
not
invalidate
it
in
madrid
in
a
special
hospital
for
venereal
patients
was
founded
by
antoine
martin
of
the
order
of
jean
de
dieu
in
the
spaniards
passed
an
ordinance
that
no
female
domestics
under
forty
years
of
age
should
be
taken
to
service
by
unmarried
men
the
tenor
of
this
law
bespeaks
the
evil
intended
to
be
remedied
in
the
present
day
little
is
done
in
spain
in
reference
to
prostitution
by
legislation
on
the
subject
in
his
memoir
on
the
subject
to
the
brussels
congress
ramon
de
la
segra
tells
us
that
the
old
edicts
have
gradually
become
obsolete
and
that
neither
the
municipal
authorities
or
general
government
take
any
farther
interest
in
the
question
than
an
occasional
enforcement
of
the
catholic
laws
against
immorality
and
women
of
ill
fame
it
is
said
that
in
seville
houses
of
prostitution
have
a
custom
of
retaining
the
services
of
a
physician
at
their
own
expense
whose
office
is
to
attend
and
make
examinations
of
the
women
cadiz
is
notorious
for
its
attractive
climate
and
its
dissipations
in
the
last
century
a
tone
of
manners
prevailed
in
the
spanish
peninsula
which
was
materially
changed
by
the
french
occupation
sweeping
away
many
of
the
laxities
of
the
age
in
the
italian
system
of
an
attendant
upon
married
ladies
was
adopted
in
spain
these
were
termed
and
it
is
stated
that
in
the
cities
they
were
principally
military
men
but
in
the
country
the
monks
performed
the
duty
the
fidelity
and
affection
of
the
women
were
directed
to
their
gallants
and
it
even
was
thought
discreditable
without
very
sufficient
reason
to
be
guilty
of
fickleness
in
this
particular
married
men
were
even
the
of
other
men
wives
neglecting
their
own
or
leaving
them
to
follow
the
bent
of
their
private
inclinations
no
husband
was
jealous
but
it
was
etiquette
for
spanish
ladies
to
keep
up
an
external
decorum
and
to
abstain
from
marked
attentions
to
a
in
the
husband
presence
although
he
might
be
perfectly
aware
of
his
wife
infidelity
and
of
her
lover
presence
in
the
house
a
curious
illustration
of
this
extraordinary
state
of
public
manners
is
given
in
an
incident
that
occurred
in
carthagena
a
gentleman
one
morning
remarked
to
a
friend
before
i
go
to
rest
this
night
the
whole
city
will
be
thrown
into
confusion
he
occasioned
this
public
disorder
by
going
home
an
hour
sooner
than
his
usual
time
whereby
his
wife
was
compelled
to
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
the
arrival
at
his
own
house
produced
a
similar
effect
which
was
multiplied
through
polite
society
all
round
the
town
by
the
spanish
laws
which
were
in
many
provinces
especially
favorable
to
women
they
could
make
cases
against
their
husbands
of
ill
treatment
and
if
they
had
beaten
them
the
punishment
might
be
made
very
severe
these
laws
were
as
may
be
supposed
the
frequent
means
of
flagrant
injustice
in
barcelona
there
was
a
magdalen
institution
having
the
double
object
of
reforming
prostitutes
and
of
correcting
women
who
failed
in
the
marriage
vow
or
who
neglected
or
disgraced
their
families
the
former
department
was
called
the
casa
de
galera
the
latter
the
casa
de
correccion
the
prostitutes
were
partially
supported
at
the
public
cost
their
extra
food
beyond
bread
and
meat
being
provided
by
their
own
labor
to
which
they
were
obliged
to
devote
themselves
all
day
the
lady
culprits
were
supported
by
their
relations
they
were
imprisoned
by
the
sentence
of
a
particular
court
on
the
complaint
of
a
member
of
their
family
and
they
as
well
as
the
prostitutes
were
required
to
work
when
deemed
necessary
these
offenders
received
personal
correction
drunkenness
was
one
of
the
grounds
of
incarceration
the
precise
offenses
are
not
mentioned
by
our
author
but
the
fashions
and
customs
of
nations
are
so
distinct
that
indiscretion
or
even
familiarity
in
one
might
be
immorality
in
another
a
leading
principle
in
spanish
manners
is
not
to
give
offense
people
may
be
as
vicious
as
they
please
it
may
be
even
notorious
that
they
are
so
but
their
manners
must
be
outwardly
correct
there
is
little
doubt
the
violation
of
this
maxim
was
the
principal
cause
of
imprisonment
in
barcelona
there
was
also
in
a
foundling
hospital
liberally
supported
a
curious
custom
was
observed
in
reference
to
the
girls
they
were
led
in
procession
when
of
marriageable
age
and
any
one
who
took
a
fancy
to
a
young
woman
might
ask
her
hand
indicating
his
choice
by
throwing
a
handkerchief
on
her
in
public
in
the
asturias
certain
forms
of
disease
appeared
with
excessive
virulence
and
were
very
common
syphilis
was
prevalent
there
was
a
hospital
at
oviedo
for
its
cure
but
patients
had
considerable
reluctance
to
apply
to
it
whether
incident
to
this
prevalence
of
syphilis
or
not
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
but
leprosy
was
very
general
and
there
were
twenty
or
more
large
houses
for
its
cure
in
the
asturias
the
common
itch
in
a
highly
aggravated
form
was
also
general
and
often
productive
of
parasitical
vermin
the
present
state
of
spanish
society
is
the
subject
of
the
usual
discrepancies
between
travelers
owing
to
their
different
prejudices
means
of
information
or
opportunities
of
making
observations
no
country
of
europe
retains
more
of
its
original
peculiarities
and
national
habits
than
spain
under
the
fervid
sun
of
andalusia
the
same
rigorous
observance
of
proprieties
is
hardly
to
be
found
as
in
the
northern
climate
of
biscay
whose
hardy
sons
have
ever
been
the
defenders
of
their
rights
and
political
privileges
madrid
as
the
capital
might
be
thought
a
fair
illustration
of
the
habits
and
manners
of
the
great
bulk
of
the
city
populations
whose
peculiarities
of
race
have
not
been
smoothed
away
by
intercommunication
the
traveling
facilities
of
spain
being
yet
among
the
worst
in
europe
the
descendants
of
the
goth
and
the
moor
are
still
distinct
in
character
a
general
prejudice
exists
as
to
the
morality
of
southern
nations
in
europe
and
the
spanish
women
are
by
no
means
exempt
from
a
full
share
of
this
unfortunate
opinion
nevertheless
a
recent
writer
says
i
speak
my
sincere
opinion
when
i
say
that
with
the
exception
of
a
few
fashionable
persons
whose
lives
do
indeed
seem
to
pass
in
one
constant
round
of
dissipations
whose
time
is
spent
in
driving
on
the
prado
attending
the
theatre
the
opera
or
the
precisely
as
their
compeers
do
in
every
other
great
city
the
spanish
women
are
the
most
domestic
in
the
world
the
most
devoted
to
the
care
of
their
children
the
most
truly
pious
and
the
best
this
latter
circumstance
may
arise
from
the
fact
that
their
fortunes
are
rarely
equal
to
their
rank
and
that
a
lavish
expenditure
would
soon
bring
ruin
upon
the
possessors
of
the
most
ancient
names
and
most
splendid
palaces
in
madrid
this
opinion
is
confined
solely
to
the
higher
classes
of
the
city
of
madrid
it
expresses
nothing
as
to
the
great
bulk
of
the
population
and
however
gratifying
the
record
of
worth
may
be
we
fear
the
eulogy
must
be
taken
grano
of
the
education
of
spanish
women
donn
piatt
states
that
by
reason
of
the
small
fortunes
of
the
nobility
the
daughters
of
an
ancient
house
must
be
made
useful
before
they
are
accomplished
that
the
first
consideration
however
is
their
religious
education
to
which
and
to
the
preparation
for
confirmation
the
great
juvenile
rite
of
catholic
countries
the
utmost
care
and
attention
are
devoted
next
after
their
religious
tuition
the
greatest
pains
are
taken
to
make
them
accomplished
housekeepers
they
are
taught
to
make
their
own
clothes
to
keep
accounts
to
regulate
their
expenditure
and
to
attend
to
the
most
minute
details
of
the
family
economy
the
advantages
of
a
good
solid
education
are
not
neglected
their
natural
capacity
and
innate
taste
for
the
arts
especially
as
musicians
and
painters
rapidly
develop
themselves
under
very
moderate
tuition
to
acquirements
of
a
superior
character
and
the
productions
of
young
women
of
high
station
are
spoken
of
with
much
admiration
one
trait
of
spanish
character
that
speaks
loudly
in
favor
of
the
women
is
the
devotion
respect
and
obedience
paid
by
sons
to
their
mothers
long
after
age
has
relieved
them
from
maternal
tutelage
in
madrid
there
is
a
hospital
for
foundlings
which
are
said
to
amount
to
about
four
thousand
annually
these
are
actual
foundlings
exposed
publicly
to
the
compassion
of
the
charitable
it
is
principally
served
by
the
sisters
of
charity
the
infants
are
intrusted
to
nurses
and
at
the
age
of
seven
they
are
transferred
to
the
unprotected
college
where
they
receive
instruction
in
the
simpler
rudiments
of
education
and
their
religious
and
moral
training
is
cared
for
there
is
also
an
asylum
to
which
others
are
drafted
to
learn
some
practical
handicraft
such
as
making
embroidery
and
which
seems
in
a
great
measure
a
institution
there
are
three

portugal
conventual
life
in
depravity
of

against
adultery
and
venereal
foundling
hospitals
of
lisbon
and
singular
institutions
for
wives
a
writer
on
portugal
in
the
year
complains
of
the
scandalous
licentiousness
of
the
monks
and
nuns
of
whom
there
were
no
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
in
a
population
of
two
millions
it
is
said
that
the
convent
odivelas
the
harem
of
the
monarch
john
contained
three
hundred
women
accounted
the
most
beautiful
and
accomplished
courtesans
in
the
kingdom
the
great
marquis
de
pombal
suppressed
many
of
these
convents
and
was
the
general
reformer
of
the
religious
orders
of
the
effect
of
such
an
example
from
such
quarters
on
the
population
at
that
time
sunk
as
they
were
in
the
most
imbecile
ignorance
little
need
be
said
the
women
of
portugal
were
reputed
to
surpass
all
european
females
in
gallantry
and
their
attractions
were
such
that
only
one
interview
was
necessary
to
complete
the
conquest
to
this
condition
of
common
immorality
the
rigor
of
their
husbands
and
male
relations
may
have
contributed
not
a
little
they
are
said
to
have
been
outrageously
jealous
and
to
have
made
no
scruple
of
murdering
any
stranger
who
gave
them
even
the
weakest
grounds
of
suspicion
in
the
fundamental
laws
of
portugal
promulgated
in
it
is
enacted
that
if
a
married
woman
commit
adultery
and
the
husband
complain
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
is
the
king
the
adulterer
and
adulteress
shall
be
condemned
to
the
flames
but
if
the
husband
retain
the
wife
neither
party
shall
be
punished
in
the
case
of
a
rape
perpetrated
on
the
person
of
a
lady
of
rank
all
the
property
of
the
ravisher
went
to
the
lady
and
in
case
the
female
were
not
noble
the
man
without
regard
to
his
rank
was
obliged
to
marry
her
the
writer
whom
we
have
already
quoted
speaks
of
the
venereal
disease
as
being
at
the
time
he
wrote
habitual
in
portugal
and
that
the
portuguese
not
knowing
how
to
cure
it
its
malignity
had
become
so
intensified
that
in
some
cases
individuals
who
had
contracted
a
peculiar
form
of
the
malady
had
died
in
a
few
hours
as
though
struck
down
by
an
active
and
deadly
poison
this
is
most
probably
the
exaggeration
of
popular
opinion
on
the
subject
more
recent
writers
are
chary
of
information
and
avoid
the
mention
of
matters
so
offensive
to
ears
polite
the
manners
and
morals
of
the
higher
ranks
of
society
must
have
undergone
a
material
change
for
the
better
in
the
present
century
for
an
english
nobleman
lord
porchester
since
earl
of
caernarvon
speaks
in
very
favorable
terms
of
the
propriety
amiability
and
excellence
of
the
portuguese
ladies
which
excepting
in
the
matter
of
intellectual
education
left
them
in
no
wise
behind
the
worthy
of
their
sex
in
other
countries
of
europe
among
the
lower
classes
however
it
would
not
seem
that
the
tone
of
morals
had
been
very
much
amended
whether
we
consider
their
regard
for
female
virtue
or
their
cultivation
of
the
maternal
tenderness
and
solicitude
natural
to
all
created
beings
in
the
neighborhood
of
oporto
country
women
may
be
met
conveying
little
babies
to
the
foundling
hospital
four
or
five
together
in
a
basket
these
helpless
creatures
are
the
illegitimate
children
of
peasant
girls
openly
deserted
in
the
villages
and
thus
forwarded
by
the
authorities
to
the
care
of
those
pious
strangers
who
undertake
their
nurture
and
preservation
in
these
cases
says
kingston
the
females
are
not
treated
by
their
parents
with
any
harshness
or
rigor
they
are
rather
compassionated
for
their
misfortune
and
are
only
sent
away
from
home
when
found
obstinately
persistent
in
a
course
of
evil
as
may
be
supposed
the
foundling
hospitals
have
abundant
claims
on
their
funds
the
real
casapia
at
belem
near
lisbon
and
another
hospital
in
lisbon
attached
to
the
casa
de
misericordia
receive
together
nearly
three
thousand
children
who
are
brought
up
to
different
callings
and
otherwise
prepared
for
active
life
as
is
usual
in
such
institutions
there
is
a
similar
asylum
equally
frequented
in
oporto
in
this
city
there
is
also
an
asylum
in
which
husbands
may
place
their
wives
during
their
own
absence
from
home
it
often
happens
that
ladies
on
such
occasions
enter
the
asylum
of
their
own
accord
there
is
also
in
oporto
an
establishment
in
the
nature
of
a
penitentiary
in
which
husbands
may
immure
their
faithless
wives
or
even
those
who
give
grounds
of
suspicion
it
is
presumed
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
even
in
portugal
this
must
be
done
under
color
of
some
legal
authority
chapter

algeria
prostitution
in
algiers
before
the
unnatural
tax
on
decree
of
number
of
prostitutes
and
nationality
of
causes
of
clandestine
punishment
of
prostitutes
a
pamphlet
has
lately
appeared
in
france
on
the
subject
of
prostitution
in
algiers
its
author
duchesne
has
rendered
service
by
collecting
a
large
number
of
important
facts
and
statistical
data
when
the
french
conquered
algiers
in
they
found
prostitution
established
there
and
prevailing
to
a
large
extent
so
far
as
we
are
able
to
ascertain
it
had
always
been
a
leading
feature
of
algerian
society
travelers
had
noticed
it
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
in
it
was
estimated
that
with
a
population
of
thirty
thousand
algiers
contained
three
thousand
prostitutes
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
notice
the
unreliable
character
of
similar
estimates
in
general
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
number
of
lewd
women
at
algiers
under
arab
rule
was
inordinately
large
they
were
mainly
moors
arabs
and
negresses
all
were
under
the
control
of
the
chief
of
the
native
police
the
mezonar
he
kept
a
list
of
them
and
laid
a
tax
amounting
to
about
two
dollars
per
month
on
each
as
he
paid
a
fixed
sum
to
the
government
for
the
privilege
of
collecting
this
tax
it
was
to
his
interest
to
increase
the
number
of
prostitutes
as
much
as
possible
and
he
appears
to
have
done
so
he
kept
in
his
employ
a
number
of
spies
who
watched
women
suspected
of
immoral
habits
and
denounced
them
whenever
they
were
detected
in
which
event
they
were
inscribed
on
the
mezonar
list
and
became
prostitutes
for
life
he
was
empowered
to
compel
every
prostitute
to
discharge
the
duties
of
her
calling
and
was
frequently
applied
to
by
strangers
to
supply
them
with
women
he
was
not
allowed
however
to
lease
women
to
christians
or
jews
twice
a
year
the
mezonar
gave
a
public
fête
to
which
all
the
male
inhabitants
of
algiers
were
invited
the
prostitutes
formed
the
female
portion
of
the
assemblage
and
the
public
officer
profited
by
the
increased
patronage
they
obtained
during
the
festivities
as
well
as
by
the
sale
of
tickets
for
the
entertainment
it
is
right
also
to
add
that
the
french
found
that
other
feature
of
oriental
manners
unnatural
habits
largely
developed
at
algiers
the
cafés
the
streets
the
baths
the
public
places
were
full
of
boys
of
remarkable
beauty
who
more
than
shared
with
the
women
the
favor
of
the
wealthier
natives
owing
to
a
criminal
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
french
authorities
no
systematic
endeavor
has
ever
been
made
to
eradicate
this
shameful
vice
which
appears
still
to
prevail
to
an
alarming
extent
the
influx
of
population
mainly
soldiery
into
a
city
thus
steeped
in
immorality
produced
natural
results
a
few
weeks
after
the
invasion
the
french
general
was
compelled
to
establish
a
dispensary
and
to
decree
that
all
dissolute
women
must
undergo
an
examination
there
once
a
week
a
tax
of
five
francs
per
month
was
laid
upon
prostitutes
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
establishment
within
less
than
a
year
such
grave
abuses
had
crept
into
the
collection
of
this
tax
that
it
was
resolved
to
farm
it
out
and
it
was
adjudged
at
auction
to
a
man
who
agreed
to
pay
francs
per
month
for
its
proceeds
in
the
monthly
tax
was
raised
successively
to
seven
and
nine
francs
per
girl
and
on
these
rates
it
was
farmed
to
one
balré
who
paid
for
the
privilege
of
collecting
it
he
was
also
entitled
to
levy
and
retain
the
amount
of
all
fines
imposed
by
the
police
on
prostitutes
and
to
charge
women
ten
francs
each
time
they
went
to
a
fête
outside
the
city
and
five
francs
if
the
fête
were
within
the
limits
the
profits
of
the
farm
were
so
great
that
in
balré
was
able
to
pay
the
government
francs
four
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
per
month
under
this
system
the
gravest
inconveniences
occurred
and
became
so
troublesome
that
in
november
the
governor
promulgated
a
decree
remodeling
the
regulations
in
force
on
the
subject
it
appears
the
farm
system
was
then
abandoned
and
the
government
agents
who
were
intrusted
with
the
collection
of
the
tax
robbed
both
the
prostitutes
and
the
state
shamefully
hence
in
december
a
new
decree
was
issued
by
the
governor
repealing
all
former
laws
and
regulations
and
placing
the
whole
subject
under
the
control
of
the
commissary
of
police
the
leading
provisions
of
that
decree
were
as
follows
every
public
woman
who
desires
to
prostitute
herself
must
declare
her
intention
beforehand
to
the
comptroller
of
public
women
who
shall
enter
her
name
in
his
register
and
present
her
with
a
which
he
shall
sign
every
girl
inscribed
on
the
register
shall
place
in
the
hands
of
the
treasurer
of
the
dispensary
monthly
a
sum
of
twenty
francs
if
she
be
a
kept
woman
and
ten
francs
if
she
be
not
kept
the
treasurer
shall
give
her
a
receipt
for
the
same
and
record
it
in
his
the
mayor
shall
be
authorized
to
remit
this
monthly
due
as
well
as
any
fines
that
may
have
been
incurred
when
the
girl
owing
the
same
can
prove
by
a
certificate
from
the
comptroller
the
treasurer
and
the
physician
that
she
is
indigent
every
girl
who
shall
not
have
paid
her
monthly
due
as
well
as
her
fines
within
ten
days
after
the
visit
to
the
dispensary
shall
undergo
an
imprisonment
of
not
less
than
five
days
and
not
more
than
three
months
unless
she
establish
her
indigence
as
aforesaid
girls
detained
in
prison
shall
on
the
first
symptoms
of
syphilis
be
transferred
to
the
dispensary
for
treatment
after
which
they
shall
be
remanded
to
prison
to
serve
the
remainder
of
the
time
the
physician
of
the
dispensary
shall
not
only
treat
patients
in
that
establishment
but
shall
pay
accidental
and
all
necessary
to
the
prostitutes
who
are
hereby
subjected
to
such
visits
he
shall
visit
the
dispensary
twice
a
day
from
to
and
from
to
he
shall
enter
upon
his
and
upon
the
of
the
girl
the
result
of
all
accidental
or
necessary
visits
he
shall
receive
a
salary
of
two
thousand
francs
this
law
is
in
force
at
the
present
time
and
is
said
to
have
led
to
great
inconvenience
police
agents
are
accused
of
levying
black
mail
on
the
prostitutes
to
an
enormous
extent
in
the
shape
of
fines
dues
for
going
to
balls
for
escaping
the
visit
to
the
dispensary
presents
to
the
policeman
on
the
birth
of
his
children
etc
the
product
of
the
tax
is
inordinately
large
amounting
independently
of
fines
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
francs
or
dollars
per
annum
for
each
girl
several
administrators
have
recommended
its
diminution
or
total
suppression
but
it
is
still
retained
in
the
year
when
the
present
law
was
passed
the
number
of
women
inscribed
on
the
police
register
was
the
total
population
of
algiers
being
of
whom
two
thirds
were
africans
and
one
third
europeans
but
the
mayor
of
the
city
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
this
figure
was
in
reality
far
below
the
truth
in
measures
were
taken
for
enforcing
the
police
regulations
more
strictly
than
before
and
some
care
was
used
to
procure
correct
statistics
of
population
and
prostitution
we
compile
the
following
table
from
several
given
by
duchesne
population
average
african
total
estimated
to
these
figures
some
of
which
are
only
approximative
must
be
added
the
number
of
french
soldiers
in
the
garrison
at
algiers
at
times
the
effective
force
has
been
as
large
as
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
men
another
point
of
interest
is
the
nationality
of
the
prostitutes
of
algiers
it
is
known
that
the
native
women
are
loose
in
their
morals
in
many
parts
of
the
interior
it
is
common
for
fathers
or
brothers
to
let
out
their
daughters
or
sisters
by
the
night
or
the
week
to
strangers
and
the
young
women
themselves
are
only
too
willing
to
ratify
a
bargain
which
promises
to
gratify
their
unbounded
sensuality
the
following
table
gives
the
nationality
of
the
registered
prostitutes
during
the
period
europeans
great
africans
arabs
on
inquiring
for
the
causes
of
prostitution
at
algiers
duchesne
found
that
they
might
be
summed
up
under
three
heads
poverty
mainly
due
to
the
french
conquest
and
the
wars
which
followed
to
the
present
day
it
appears
that
it
is
not
unusual
for
an
arab
chief
to
relieve
his
wants
by
sending
his
prettiest
daughter
to
algiers
to
perform
a
campaign
as
a
prostitute
the
idleness
in
which
all
arab
and
moorish
women
are
trained
it
was
proved
that
while
all
the
european
women
were
capable
of
working
at
some
calling
or
other
and
did
work
during
their
stay
in
the
hospital
not
one
of
the
native
women
had
any
idea
of
manual
employment
a
few
could
sing
and
had
at
one
time
gained
a
livelihood
as
but
the
immense
majority
were
absolutely
incapable
of
doing
any
thing
for
a
livelihood
the
oriental
idea
that
the
woman
is
a
chattel
to
be
sold
or
hired
out
by
her
legitimate
owner
father
brother
or
husband
this
idea
which
prevails
in
many
savage
nations
among
others
many
of
our
own
indian
tribes
is
of
course
the
best
of
all
entering
wedges
for
prostitution
there
are
fourteen
houses
of
prostitution
at
algiers
all
kept
it
seems
by
europeans
and
the
greater
part
by
retired
prostitutes
the
natives
object
to
living
under
the
control
of
a
they
live
alone
in
their
own
rooms
sometimes
three
or
four
of
them
club
together
and
form
a
partnership
their
rooms
are
generally
shabby
and
ill
furnished
arab
prostitutes
seldom
appear
in
the
streets
and
when
they
do
they
are
veiled
and
dressed
like
modest
women
they
may
be
seen
at
their
windows
of
an
evening
peeping
through
small
holes
contrived
for
the
purpose
and
smoking
cigarettes
their
customers
are
procured
by
means
of
runners
who
are
mostly
small
boys
as
may
be
inferred
from
the
amount
of
the
tax
on
prostitutes
clandestine
prostitution
is
very
extensively
practiced
at
algiers
we
have
no
details
or
even
approximate
estimates
of
the
number
of
clandestine
prostitutes
but
it
doubtless
exceeds
that
of
the
registered
women
many
of
them
are
attached
to
the
garrison
and
are
handed
from
regiment
to
regiment
shielded
from
the
police
by
being
claimed
as
wives
by
some
of
the
soldiers
others
in
like
manner
prevail
upon
some
colonist
to
afford
them
a
temporary
home
and
so
elude
the
visit
of
the
physician
duchesne
had
reason
to
believe
that
syphilis
prevailed
to
an
alarming
extent
among
the
secret
prostitutes
and
that
until
the
tax
was
removed
and
they
were
encouraged
to
register
themselves
on
the
police
roll
it
would
continue
to
be
general
and
virulent
formerly
the
baths
were
the
great
haunts
of
clandestine
prostitutes
it
is
known
that
in
most
eastern
countries
the
bath
is
not
only
a
sanitary
necessity
but
a
common
ally
of
sensuality
at
algiers
before
the
conquest
men
and
women
are
said
to
have
bathed
promiscuously
and
frightful
scenes
of
debauchery
occurred
daily
under
french
rule
this
has
been
reformed
men
may
not
bathe
from
to
but
duchesne
was
led
to
believe
that
it
was
quite
common
for
men
to
introduce
women
into
the
baths
at
night
with
the
connivance
of
the
bath
officials
indeed
some
of
the
latter
appear
to
fill
the
same
office
to
the
algerine
bathers
as
the
roman
bath
servants
did
to
the
dissolute
men
of
that
day
it
now
remains
to
speak
of
the
dispensary
at
algiers
it
was
established
as
has
been
stated
within
a
few
days
after
the
capture
of
the
place
for
nearly
ten
years
it
was
a
scandal
to
the
faculty
and
the
authorities
the
wards
were
too
small
there
were
not
beds
enough
for
the
women
every
thing
was
either
deficient
in
quantity
or
objectionable
in
quality
in
orders
were
given
for
the
establishment
of
a
proper
and
commodious
dispensary
three
old
moorish
houses
were
hired
and
divided
into
wards
they
contain
at
present
thirteen
wards
with
beds
for
patients
a
containing
six
baths
a
hall
for
the
visits
of
prostitutes
and
the
necessary
offices
etc
the
staff
of
the
dispensary
consists
of
a
director
treasurer
physician
apothecary
clerk
cook
assistant
apothecary
porter
five
laborers
and
four
police
agents
all
the
washing
is
done
in
the
establishment
the
commissariat
is
on
the
amplest
scale
meat
soup
vegetables
of
all
kinds

supplied
in
abundance
to
the
patients
every
morning
at
seven
the
women
are
visited
by
the
physician
assisted
by
the
apothecary
those
who
are
able
to
walk
are
examined
in
the
de
the
others
in
their
beds
the
average
number
of
patients
during
the
year
appears
to
be
from
five
hundred
and
fifty
to
six
hundred
the
average
duration
of
the
treatment
is
from
to
days
the
cost
to
the
dispensary
averages
from
one
and
a
half
to
one
and
three
quarters
franc
per
day
for
each
girl
about
thirty
or
cents
the
dispensary
physician
reported
to
duchesne
that
so
far
as
his
observation
went
syphilis
was
more
severe
on
the
than
in
the
interior
and
in
the
months
of
september
october
november
and
december
than
at
any
other
period
of
the
year
prostitutes
are
punished
for
being
more
than
hours
behind
time
in
visiting
the
dispensary
for
leaving
it
during
treatment
for
insulting
the
physician
or
other
authorities
for
continuing
to
exercise
their
calling
after
being
attacked
by
disease
the
penalty
is
imprisonment
either
in
the
ordinary
prison
or
in
the
solitary
cell
formerly
the
was
used
and
in
bad
cases
a

hair
was
cut
off
and
her
nose
slit
but
these
savage
relics
of
moorish
legislation

long

abandoned
solitary
confinement

found
to
answer
every
useful
purpose
chapter

belgium
hospitals
and
charitable
estimate
of
the
marriage
regulations
as
to
sanitary
ordinances
belgium
takes
a
more
prominent
position
in
europe
than
its
mere
extent
would
warrant
this
influence
is
derived
from
the
vigorous
and
effective
stand
made
in
behalf
of
rational
freedom
and
from
the
manner
in
which
free
institutions
have
been
originated
and
maintained
the
hospitals
and
other
eleemosynary
institutions
of
belgium
are
of
a
magnificent
character
supported
at
an
annual
expenditure
of
nearly
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
almost
every
town
and
many
of
the
larger
villages
have
hospitals
for
the
sick
sometimes
maintained
at
corporation
expense
sometimes
by
private
endowments
in
hospitals
during
the
four
years
from
to
inclusive
no
less
than
persons
were
treated
foundling
hospitals
are
a
marked
feature
of
these
charitable
establishments
the
turning
table
which
was
formerly
in
use
in
all
such
institutions
has
lately
been
abandoned
in
most
of
them
but
still
remains
in
use
at
those
of
brussels
and
antwerp
the
total
number
of
children
annually
abandoned
in
belgium
is
estimated
to
exceed
eight
thousand
out
of
one
hundred
and
thousand
births
a
ratio
of
about
one
in
eighteen
the
average
expense
attendant
upon
the
maintenance
of
each
infant
is
about
francs
marriage
in
belgium
is
by
law
simply
a
civil
contract
requiring
fifteen
days
notice
posted
in
front
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
notwithstanding
the
simplicity
of
this
ceremonial
it
is
affirmed
that
an
enormous
extent
of
immorality
and
illegitimacy
is
to
be
met
with
and
that
a
virtuous
is
altogether
exceptional
there
being
scarcely
one
of
them
who
has
not
an
illegitimate
child
while
they
maintain
with
the
most
unyielding
confidence
that
so
long
as
the
father
is
a
sweetheart
there
is
no
moral
turpitude
in
the
case
belgium
is
remarkable
for
its
regulations
with
respect
to
prostitution
and
the
spread
of
venereal
disease
the
perfections
of
the
latter
arrangements
are
shown
in
the
fact
that
out
of
an
army
of
thirty
thousand
men
there
were
less
than
two
hundred
cases
of
syphilis
in
the
year
the
brothels
of
brussels
are
of
two
kinds
maisons
de
and
maisons
de
these
are
visited
by
filles
who
keep
their
appointments
there
the
two
classes
of
houses
are
distinguished
by
lanterns
hung
over
the
doors
all
classes
of
prostitutes
are
required
to
be
examined
twice
a
week
those
who
live
in
brothels
of
the
first
and
second
class
are
visited
by
the
physicians
while
the
very
poor
women
of
the
third
class
and
all
those
who
do
not
reside
in
brothels
are
obliged
to
attend
at
the
dispensary
if
they
are
punctual
in
their
visits
for
four
weeks
in
succession
they
are
exempt
from
all
tax
but
if
on
the
contrary
their
attendance
is
irregular
they
can
be
imprisoned
from
one
to
five
days
any
woman
who
does
not
live
in
a
brothel
can
be
examined
at
her
own
residence
provided
that
she
pays
at
the
dispensary
a
sum
amounting
to
about
cents
for
this
she
receives
four
visits
and
the
physicians
will
continue
to
call
upon
her
as
long
as
the
payments
are
made
in
advance
thus
the
denizens
of
the
aristocratic
brothels
are
saved
the
inconvenience
of
attending
at
the
dispensary
as
also
that
portion
living
in
private
lodgings
who
can
afford
to
pay
the
fee
to
release
themselves
from
going
to
the
office
as
common
prostitutes
while
the
pauper
of
the
third
class
must
wait
at
the
dispensary
until
examined
and
then
return
to
her
squalid
home
where
none
but
her
companions
and
the
are
ever
seen
the
medical
staff
of
the
dispensary
is
composed
of
a
superintending
inspector
whose
duty
is
to
be
present
in
the
dispensary
when
examinations
are
being
made
and
to
visit
the
houses
once
a
fortnight
at
least
of
two
medical
inspectors
who
during
alternate
months
examine
one
the
women
in
the
brothels
the
other
those
who
attend
at
the
dispensary
the
date
and
result
of
every
examination
are
marked
on
a
card
belonging
to

the
ancient
legislative
enactments
respecting
prostitution
in
hamburg
seem
to
have
been
of
the
same
character
and
based
upon
the
same
principles
as
in
other
continental
cities
namely
a
partial
toleration
of
a
necessary
evil
for
the
sake
of
preventing
injurious
excesses
this
may
be
traced
in
the
oldest
extant
law
on
the
subject
dated
in
in
the
public
for
are
entries
of
charges
which
imply
that
public
brothels
were
built
by
the
corporation
though
we
find
no
satisfactory
information
as
to
whether
they
were
managed
by
an
appointed
official
as
in
cologne
strasbourg
or
avignon
or
were
leased
by
the
city
to
an
individual
as
in
ulm
it
will
be
interesting
to
give
a
sketch
of
the
regulations
of
prostitution
in
the
latter
city
before
proceeding
with
the
investigation
concerning
hamburg
the
laws
of
the
city
of
ulm
in
or
at
least
that
portion
of
them
called
woman
house
laws
provided
that
the
houses
should
be
leased
and
the
lessee
on
becoming
tenant
swore
to
serve
the
city
faithfully
to
prevent
all
foul
play
or
concealment
of
suspicious
goods
in
his
house
to
provide
clean
healthy
women
and
never
to
keep
less
than
fourteen
he
was
bound
to
observe
a
fixed
dietary
scale
the
daily
meals
were
to
be
of
the
value
of
sixpence
on
meat
days
every
woman
was
to
have
two
dishes
soup
with
meat
and
vegetables
and
a
roast
or
boiled
joint
as
most
convenient
on
and
in
lent
they
were
to
have
the
same
number
of
dishes
which
out
of
lent
might
consist
of
eggs
and
baked
meat
as
a
change
to
this
they
might
have
herrings
and
eggs
or
fishes
probably
fish
which
they
could
cook
for
themselves
and
to
which
the
keeper
must
add
white
bread
if
a
woman
refused
the
food
provided
he
was
bound
to
give
her
something
of
the
value
of
sixpence
he
was
also
to
sell
them
wine
when
they
required
it
if
a
woman
was
pregnant
he
was
to
put
her
out
of
the
house
in
the
woman
house
there
was
a
chest
for
general
purposes
and
a
for
the
accounts
between
the
host
and
the
women
every
woman
who
kept
company
with
a
man
at
night
must
pay
the
keeper
a
kreutzer
the
remainder
of
the
fee
being
her
own
property
all
money
the
women
obtained
in
the
day
was
to
be
put
into
the
general
chest
the
third
of
this
belonged
to
the
host
the
balance
was
paid
to
the
women
at
the
end
of
the
week
less
any
debts
they
had
contracted
in
the
mean
time
a
woman
resided
in
every
house
who
made
financial
arrangements
between
inmates
and
visitors
if
a
woman
received
a
present
in
addition
to
the
stipulated
fee
she
was
at
liberty
to
spend
it
on
clothes
shoes
or
personal
matters
to
which
nobody
could
lay
claim
the
keeper
could
not
supply
the
women
with
clothes
without
the
knowledge
and
consent
of
the
master
of
the
beggars
a
local
functionary
who
seems
to
have
combined
the
supervision
of
brothels
and
of
known
vagrants
and
beggars
the
host
was
required
to
provide
at
his
own
cost
a
cook
and
a
cook
maid
girls
or
women
could
with
their
own
consent
be
apprenticed
to
the
women
keeper
by
their
parents
or
husbands
but
if
one
was
apprenticed
against
her
will
and
she
or
her
friends
wished
to
cancel
the
agreement
the
keeper
was
bound
to
release
her
without
requiring
the
repayment
of
any
money
he
might
have
disbursed
for
her
if
a
woman
who
had
accumulated
a
guilder
of
her
own
wished
to
quit
her
sinful
life
she
was
allowed
to
tender
it
to
the
keeper
in
discharge
of
all
her
liabilities
and
must
then
be
permitted
to
leave
the
house
wearing
the
clothes
she
wore
when
she
entered
it
or
if
they
were
worn
out
in
her
common
monday
clothes
a
woman
who
desired
might
leave
without
this
payment
if
she
had
nothing
to
give
but
if
subsequently
detected
in
any
other
house
the
keeper
could
enforce
his
demands
against
her
the
discharge
not
affecting
his
claim
under
such
circumstances
every
monday
each
woman
had
to
contribute
one
penny
and
the
host
twopence
to
the
to
purchase
tapers
for
the
virgin
and
the
saints
to
be
offered
in
the
cathedral
on
sunday
nights
if
any
of
the
women
were
sick
or
could
not
support
themselves
they
were
to
be
provided
with
necessaries
from
the
to
which
for
greater
security
there
were
two
keys
one
kept
by
the
host
and
the
other
by
the
master
of
the
beggars
each
woman
had
to
spin
daily
for
the
keeper
two
hanks
of
yarn
or
in
default
to
pay
three
hellers
for
each
hank
on
sunday
and
after
vespers
and
in
passion
week
the
house
was
not
to
be
opened
if
the
keeper
broke
any
of
these
regulations
the
council
could
dismiss
him
the
oath
taken
by
the
master
of
the
beggars
required
him
to
visit
the
every
quarter
day
to
read
the
laws
to
the
women
and
to
report
to
the
council
any
offenses
he
found
existing
in
hamburg
in
the
calling
of
was
limited
to
certain
streets
apart
from
the
ordinarily
frequented
thoroughfares
a
rule
which
would
imply
that
the
authorities
had
discontinued
building
public
brothels
and
relinquished
the
business
to
individuals
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
different
course
of
action
was
adopted
and
in
place
of
toleration
and
limitation
of
brothels
strict
laws
were
made
in
reference
to
visiting
suspected
places
and
the
custody
of
persons
of
bad
character
the
were
pulled
down
and
the
women
expelled
the
criminal
records
contain
frequent
instances
where
the
pillory
or
exile
was
inflicted
for
the
crime
of
prostitution
in
and
again
in
the
hamburgers
enacted
very
severe
laws
against
offenders
under
the
title
of
by
which
both
sexes
were
subject
to
pains
and
penalties
but
men
seem
to
have
been
allowed
to
clear
themselves
on
oath
the
officers
of
justice
were
directed
to
make
domiciliary
visits
in
search
of
offenders
and
the
pillory
bread
and
water
the
house
of
correction
or
banishment
are
the
penalties
threatened
on
habitual
in
germany
prostitution
received
a
terrible
impulse
from
the
french
revolution
when
the
general
disruption
of
public
obligations
paved
the
way
to
unbounded
private
license
probably
the
licentiousness
of
europe
at
the
end
of
the
last
and
commencement
of
the
present
century
was
more
extravagant
than
at
any
other
time
the
irruption
of
immigrants
at
the
fall
of
the
french
monarchy
flooded
hamburg
with
parisian
morals
and
customs
places
of
entertainment
and
sensual
gratification
arose
in
all
directions
the
homely
simple
manners
of
the
were
subverted
and
a
less
rigid
line
of
conduct
took
their
place
in
the
words
of
a
writer
of
the
day
our
were
metamorphosed
into
restaurants
our
into
saloons
our
into
pavilions
our
cellars
into
halls
our
girls
into
demoiselles
in
short
we
were
thoroughly
polished
up
by
the
immoral
shoal
of
immigrants
quick
and
unrestrained
strode
the
crowd
over
our
pleasant
streets
and
modesty
and
respectability
fled
with
averted
faces
to
the
sorrow
of
the
few
good
men
the
name
was
granted
to
many
of
the
common
women
their
places
of
resort
being
called
houses
in
those
days
the
hamburgers
saw
with
astonishment
houses
fitted
up
and
furnished
in
the
style
of
mansions
with
costly
upholstery
and
among
the
women
were
the
who
received
their
friends
at
certain
hours
and
whose
favors
were
dispensed
for
a
louis
or
a
ducat
they
frequented
the
first
and
second
boxes
of
the
german
and
french
theatres
and
drove
through
the
public
streets
in
handsome
carriages
some
of
the
keepers
of
this
class
of
houses
had
physicians
in
their
pay
whose
services
were
always
available
by
the
inmates
were
given
here
and
sometimes
a
ball
took
place
these
were
literally
the
aristocracy
of
prostitution
the
second
third
and
fourth
grades
resided
in
inferior
streets
or
in
the
suburbs
differing
in
their
attractions
according
to
the
rank
which
they
assumed
but
all
equally
shameless
and
unequivocal
in
their
conduct
and
appearance
notwithstanding
this
rapid
spread
of
prostitution
the
police
of
the
city
can
not
justly
be
charged
with
neglect
of
duty
any
public
outrage
being
followed
by
condign
punishment
at
one
time
a
whole
of
nymphs
of
the
was
dispatched
to
the
colonies
at
another
a
raid
was
made
on
the
most
conspicuous
houses
some
of
the
inmates
alarmed
into
decency
of
conduct
and
the
incorrigible
publicly
exhibited
in
the
streets
decorated
with
inscriptions
signifying
their
offenses
the
voice
of
the
few
was
powerless
against
the
corruptions
of
the
many
the
pamphlets
and
papers
of
the
time
teem
with
the
proffered
services
of
and
even
the
hamburg
ladies
themselves
were
far
from
perfection
if
we
may
credit
the
evidence
of
a
fictitious
petition
praying
among
other
things
that
the
ladies
restrict
the
indecency
of
their
costume
and
not
make
such
a
liberal
display
of
their
charms
it
was
impossible
such
an
extravagant
state
of
society
should
long
exist
a
reaction
was
inevitable
and
we
find
accordingly
an
ordinance
enacted
in
by
the
proctor
abendroth
in
reference
to
the
matter
it
recognized
and
prostitution
as
a
calling
and
permitted
it
under
certain
restrictions
a
tax
on
the
class
was
imposed
and
means
were
prescribed
by
which
a
register
of
all
persons
engaged
therein
was
to
be
kept
and
their
health
and
general
good
conduct
maintained
and
enforced
the
official
justification
of
the
tax
is
found
in
the
order
itself
which
declares
that
for
the
purposes
aforesaid
police
register
and
supervision
medical
examination
maintenance
in
sickness
poverty
etc
and
in
order
that
the
public
shall
be
at
no
charges
each
housekeeper
shall
for
every
woman
residing
with
him
pay
two
marks
to
the
treasury
the
surplus
of
this
treasury
shall
go
to
the
hospital
during
the
french
occupation
in
the
police
renewed
and
enforced
the
stringent
regulations
on
the
subject
of
common
houses
and
women
the
preamble
of
their
instructions
april
is
worthy
of
notice
public
and
personal
safety
require
a
constant
inspection
as
well
of
the
public
houses
dedicated
to
debauchery
as
of
the
women
and
girls
who
frequent
the
same
live
therein
or
dwell
there
from
time
to
time
this
inspection
must
also
be
extended
to
those
places
which
are
not
expressly
appointed
for
but
which
nevertheless
must
be
included
among
the
public
houses
inasmuch
as
they
serve
for
refuge
to
the
women
and
girls
who
wander
about
the
streets
the
grounds
of
this
inspection
are
in
one
respect
they
belong
to
the
maintenance
of
public
order
it
is
needful
that
no
one
be
withdrawn
from
the
eye
of
the
police
nor
find
an
asylum
in
such
houses
it
is
likewise
expedient
that
the
magistracy
take
notice
of
disgraceful
and
disorderly
proceedings
or
prevent
those
which
take
place
too
often
in
the
town
the
other
grounds
respect
the
public
health
the
habits
of
debauchery
have
become
so
general
and
inspection
has
for
some
years
become
so
difficult
that
the
most
dangerous
maladies
have
increased
to
an
unprecedented
extent
all
classes
of
society
complain
and
call
loudly
for
regulations
to
restrain
these
evils
these
considerations
have
moved
the
general
police
commissary
to
renew
in
full
force
the
laws
and
regulations
and
to
order
them
to
be
enforced
with
rigor
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
after
the
withdrawal
of
the
french
the
vigilance
of
the
police
authorities
seems
to
have
relaxed
if
we
are
to
judge
by
complaints
published
at
the
time
in
which
they
are
accused
of
complicity
with
the
unfortunates
who
infested
the
streets
of
hamburg
and
are
said
by
the
agency
of
a
trifling
bribe
to
be
able
to
ply
their
hideous
trade
unobstructed
and
to
the
great
annoyance
of
the
virtuously
disposed
who
after
certain
hours
of
the
evening
are
unable
to
pass
along
the
streets
in
the
previously
existing
police
regulations
against
prostitutes
being
proved
very
ineffectual
insomuch
that
they
infest
the
public
streets
and
ways
not
only
to
the
offense
of
decency
and
propriety
but
to
the
endangerment
of
public
order
and
safety
it
was
ordered
that
the
regulations
should
be
renewed
and
additional
powers
were
given
to
the
police
to
enforce
the
registry
of
individuals
coming
within
the
scope
of
the
law
at
this
time
we
find
some
information
as
to
the
number
of
prostitutes
who
are
stated
to
be
about
five
hundred
chiefly
foreigners
and
their
receipts
from
their
patrons
but
we
have
no
guide
to
the
number
of
women
who
pursued
their
calling
privately
which
must
have
been
large
the
civic
administration
of
the
senator
hudtwalcker
is
marked
by
earnest
endeavors
to
control
prostitution
and
restrict
it
within
known
bounds
some
of
his
views
on
the
subject
met
much
opposition
he
wished
to
close
up
one
end
of
a
notorious
street
and
to
wall
up
the
back
windows
stationing
a
watchman
constantly
at
the
end
left
open
after
great
personal
attention
to
the
subject
he
published
the
result
of
his
experience
his
principles
are
those
upon
which
the
present
police
regulations
of
hamburg
are
based
he
says
all
and
girls
should
be
distinctly
made
to
understand
that
their
infamous
and
ruinous
calling
is
only
not
permitted
or
authorized
or
even
well
wished
still
less
can
they
feel
that
they
have
any
right
to
compare
themselves
with
worthy
citizens
as
though
their
calling
because
an
impost
is
levied
on
them
can
be
put
on
a
level
with
other
permitted
callings
they
must
remember
that
this
impost
is
raised
solely
to
defray
the
necessary
cost
of
police
supervision
and
of
the
cure
of
maladies
brought
on
the
common
women
by
their

profligate
course

and

having
thus
briefly
sketched
the
progress
of
legislation
on
prostitution
in
hamburg
based
upon
the
principle
that
prostitution
is
a
necessary
evil
and
as
such
must
be
endured
under
strict
supervision
of
the
authorities
it
seems
an
appropriate
place
to
copy
the
following
remarks
of
an
eminent
local
writer
that
brothels
are
an
evil
no
one
can
deny
still
the
arguments
against
the
sufferance
of
brothels
are
except
as
to
that
incontestable
truth
no
answer
to
the
which
is
the
very
of
the
thing
and
which
necessity
is
based
on
the
uncontrollable
nature
of
sexual
intercourse
and
on
the
circumstances
of
our
social
condition
the
sufferance
of
brothels
is
necessary
for
the
repression
of
profligacy
of
private
prostitution
as
well
as
of
its
kindred
crimes
adultery
rape
abortion
infanticide
and
all
kinds
of
illicit
gratification
of
sexual
passion
the
latter
cases
occur
very
rarely
with
us
of
pæderasty
or
sodomy
we
find
but
few
instances
and
of
that
unnatural
intercourse
of
women
with
each
other
referred
to
by
as
common
among
the
parisian
girls
we
find
no
trace
the
sufferance
of
brothels
operates
to
the
suppression
of
private
prostitution
in
so
far
as
and
the
women
are
for
their
own
interest
opposed
to
it
and
are
serviceable
to
the
police
in
its
detection
unquestionably
private
prostitution
is
an
incalculably
greater
evil
than
public
vice
on
grounds
of
public
policy
in
regard
to
health
it
is
quite
erroneous
to
suppose
that
these
legalized
brothels
contribute
to
the
spread
of
syphilitic
maladies
this
should
rather
be
imputed
to
the
private
prostitution
which
would
ensue
on
the
breaking
up
of
the
brothels
and
from
which
that
medical
police
supervision
that
now
limits
the
spread
of
infection
would
of
course
be
withdrawn
the
experience
of
all
time
proves
that
by
means
of
secret
prostitution
the
intensity
and
virulence
of
venereal
disorders
have
been
aggravated
to
the
multiplication
of
those
appalling
examples
familiar
to
every
medical
reader
and
which
cause
one
to
shudder
with
horror
while
numerically
disease
and
its
consequences
have
been
carried
into
every
class
of
society
it
is
precisely
our
knowledge
of
these
very
facts
which
has
induced
the
sufferance
or
rather
the
regulation
of
these
brothels
absolutely
impracticable
inasmuch
as
the
evil
is
rooted
in
an
unconquerable
physical
requirement
it
would
seem
as
if
the
zeal
against
public
brothels
implied
that
by
their
extinction
a
limitation
of
sexual
intercourse
except
in
marriage
would
be
effected
this
is
erroneous
for
reliable
details
prove
that
for
every
hundred
brothel
women
there
would
be
two
hundred
private
prostitutes
and
no
human
power
could
prevent
this
in
a
great
city
and
frequented
like
hamburg
the
hope
of
amending
this
would
be
purely
chimerical
thus
much
for
hamburg
legislation
and
the
sound
arguments
in
its
favor
we
will
now
give
some
facts
illustrative
of
the
vice
as
it
exists
at
the
present
time
using
a
pamphlet
by
lippert
entitled
prostitution
in
hamburg
it
must
be
premised
that
for
the
purpose
hamburg
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
city
proper
and
the
suburb
of
paul
the
latter
is
under
a
distinct
municipal
authority
and
is
the
ordinary
residence
of
seamen
and
those
depending
on
a
seafaring
life
for
many
years
the
police
returns
of
the
city
proper
would
show
about
five
hundred
of
the
registered
common
women
and
one
hundred
registered
brothels
the
police
regulations
requiring
monthly
payment
of
the
personal
and
house
tax
and
also
a
renewal
of
the
permission
to
keep
brothels
at
the
same
time
is
a
very
convenient
method
of
obtaining
a
census
of
the
class
the
following
is
a
statement
of
the
largest
and
smallest
monthly
number
of
registered
women
for
several
years
year
largest
number
smallest
number
no
no
reports
these
monthly
reports
do
not
show
any
marked
variation
at
any
particular
period
the
rise
and
fall
being
arbitrary
the
fluctuation
is
not
very
great
in
the
aggregate
although
from
november
to
january
there
was
a
decrease
of
or
nearly
one
fifth
while
between
november
and
january
there
was
a
corresponding
increase
since
that
time
the
numbers
have
remained
steadily
at
about
one
point
the
housekeepers
return
does
not
vary
to
the
same
extent
the
average
is
but
it
decreased
in
to
of
these
housekeepers
in
the
year
there
were
males
females
in
december
there
were
registered
women
who
were
subdivided
into
those
living
in
registered
houses
living
privately
in
may
there
were
registered
women
who
were
subdivided
into
those
living
in
registered
houses
living
privately
at
this
period
there
were
four
registered
houses
without
any
women
in
them
in
august
there
were
registered
women
who
were
subdivided
into
those
living
in
registered
houses
living
privately
these
figures
show
that
the
number
of
those
living
privately
is
gradually
diminishing
more
of
them
being
concentrated
in
the
registered
houses
lippert
is
of
opinion
that
prostitution
decreases
in
the
summer
and
increases
in
the
winter
months
the
statistics
will
certainly
support
this
theory
but
the
difference
is
so
small
as
scarcely
to
warrant
its
reception
as
a
rule
thus
the
months
of
may
and
july
for
five
years
give
a
monthly
average
of
and
the
months
of
november
and
january
for
the
same
time
give
a
monthly
average
of
showing
an
average
increase
in
the
winter
months
of
or
about
one
third
of
one
per
cent
on
the
average
number
of
prostitutes
in
reference
to
the
classes
from
which
the
ranks
of
the
common
women
in
hamburg
are
recruited
lippert
states
that
four
fifths
are
from
the
agricultural
districts
of
the
vicinity
that
they
live
as
or
in
other
callings
for
a
time
and
then
become
prostitutes
as
a
matter
of
business
without
any
desire
to
controvert
his
opinion
on
local
questions
it
may
be
doubted
whether
bad
example
vicious
education
ignorance
of
moral
or
religious
obligations
or
temptation
are
not
sufficient
to
account
for
their
fall
aside
from
this
sweeping
denunciation
this
commercial
view
of
the
question
opposed
as
it
is
to
all
experience
in
every
civilized
country
where
any
inquiries
on
the
subject
have
been
made
the
private
prostitutes
whether
registered
or
unregistered
are
mainly
seamstresses
or
others
dependent
upon
daily
labor
these
women
seem
to
retain
some
natural
sense
of
the
disgrace
attached
to
open
and
avowed
courtesans
and
in
their
secrecy
and
quiet
retain
a
few
feminine
characteristics
of
which
the
common
brothel
woman
is
destitute
we
have
no
reliable
detail
of
private
unregistered
prostitution
or
of
mere
houses
of
accommodation
in
hamburg
but
an
important
fact
is
to
be
found
in
the
number
of
illegitimate
children
and
the
decrease
in
proportion
to
the
population
of
the
number
of
marriages
the
following
results
are
taken
from
neddermeyer
statistics
and
topography
of
hamburg
in
the
marriages
were
about
in
from
to
in
the
proportion
of
illegitimate
to
legitimate
children
is
about
to
the
actual
number
of
illegitimate
births
being
as
follows
years
illegitimate
births
the
population
of
hamburg
was
in
or
upward
was
assumed
as
the
number
we
have
now
to
examine
the
physiological
and
pathological
peculiarities
of
the
hamburg
prostitutes
the
police
regulations
require
that
no
registered
woman
shall
be
under
twenty
years
of
age
but
in
this
they
have
a
discretionary
power
so
as
to
keep
under
inspection
and
supervision
some
younger
girls
whom
neither
the
nor
prison
can
reclaim
the
experience
of
the
hamburg
authorities
having
convinced
them
that
such
institutions
are
seldom
successful
in
the
work
of
a
truth
which
will
ere
long
be
more
generally
acknowledged
especially
in
reference
to
abandoned
women
than
it
is
at
the
present
day
the
official
list
for
shows
that
of
the
registered
prostitutes
there
were
under
years
of
age
from
to
years
total
in
of
women
living
in
registered
houses
there
were
from
years
to
years
of
age
total
the
of
the
women
reported
in
included
most
of
the
countries
in
germany
there
were
from
hamburg
hanover
prussia
holstein
other
parts
of
germany
holland
russia
france
total
the
nativity
returns
for
women
in
do
not
vary
materially
from
the
above
the
difference
in
the
being
that
there
were
four
instead
of
five
born
out
of
germany
these
tables
show
that
about
one
in
five
are
natives
of
hamburg
city
and
territory
lippert
notices
this
fact
as
a
small
proportion
and
accounts
for
it
by
enumerating
the
difficulties
of
local
relationship
parentage
which
would
be
opposed
to
the
registration
of
native
women
these
circumstances
favor
the
presumption
that
many
of
the
unregistered
women
are
city
born
the
hamburger
berg
or
paul
suburb
is
on
the
west
side
of
hamburg
and
has
already
been
mentioned
as
the
abode
of
seamen
and
their
dependents
brothels
were
tolerated
here
in
deference
to
the
wants
of
the
inhabitants
at
a
time
when
they
were
strictly
excluded
from
the
city
proper
the
women
and
the
houses
are
of
a
different
type
from
those
of
other
parts
of
hamburg
all
the
prostitutes
live
in
registered
houses
unregistered
or
private
traffic
in
this
quarter
being
rigorously
opposed
by
the
authorities
the
brothels
and
their
inmates
are
in
the
most
flourishing
condition
at
the
end
of
autumn
when
the
home
voyages
are
completed
and
the
sailors
paid
off
for
a
time
mirth
and
excitement
bear
the
sway
when
the
wages
are
all
spent
things
relapse
into
their
old
condition
and
sometimes
the
keepers
dismiss
some
of
their
women
the
supply
being
in
excess
of
the
demand
during
the
year
the
number
of
registered
women
in
this
district
was
january
may
august
december
the
women
registered
in
december
were
distributed
among
nineteen
tolerated
houses
in
seven
of
these
music
and
dancing
were
permitted
and
they
contained
respectively
women
leaving
only
women
to
inhabit
the
remaining
twelve
houses
the
ages
of
these
women
were
under
years
from
to
years
total
the
places
of
birth
do
not
vary
materially
from
the
proportions
given
already
other
matters
relating
to
this
particular
class
will
be
found
hereafter
in
their
the
great
majority
of
the
registered
women
present
no
pleasing
aspect
generally
taken
from
the
rudest
classes
they
are
coarse
and
unattractive
in
their
appearance
and
from
the
consequences
of
irregular
indulgence
and
continual
exposure
they
soon
lose
the
womanly
characteristics
they
once
possessed
but
this
is
not
a
portrait
of
the
whole
among
the
unregistered
private
women
may
be
found
some
of
considerable
beauty
the
registered
women
who
reside
in
private
or
in
brothels
have
some
prepossessing
members
of
their
ranks
while
the
paul
suburb
has
few
but
of
the
roughest
kind
physical
strength
seems
more
in
demand
among
the
of
that
section
than
a
graceful
form
or
a
pretty
face
in
their
bodily
peculiarities
and
diseases
there
is
no
difference
between
the
public
women
of
hamburg
and
those
of
other
cities
at
the
commencement
of
their
career
they
frequently
become
thin
and
emaciated
but
after
a
time
probably
owing
to
their
idle
life
and
good
food
regain
their
substance
in
their
phrenological
development
we
find
a
marked
preponderance
of
the
animal
instincts
over
the
intellectual
faculties
the
effect
of
their
mode
of
life
will
depend
somewhat
upon
individual
constitution
the
teeth
of
women
of
the
town
are
generally
bad
but
in
hamburg
they
are
in
excellent
order
much
better
than
the
majority
of
the
general
population
their
complexion
is
pale
and
they
endeavor
to
remedy
this
by
the
constant
use
of
coarse
cloths
applications
of
eau
de
cologne
and
other
stimulants
but
very
rarely
by
painting
except
among
the
lowest
classes
they
soon
lose
their
hair
from
dissipation
the
use
of
pomatum
curling
irons
etc
it
is
however
in
the
rough
harsh
voice
that
the
most
conspicuous
result
of
their
calling
is
shown
we
will
leave
for
the
present
the
medical
portion
of
this
inquiry
and
give
a
sketch
of
their
domestic
or
life
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
police
divisions
are
into
registered
or
unregistered
and
public
or
private
women
the
public
women
are
under
the
special
control
and
supervision
of
a
police
authority
charged
with
this
duty
without
his
express
cognizance
and
permission
they
can
not
be
registered
or
written
in
nor
can
they
have
liberty
to
change
their
residence
or
to
be
written
out
this
officer
is
the
collector
of
the
impost
upon
them
and
upon
the
which
is
paid
over
to
the
fund
we
can
not
give
the
detailed
application
of
this
money
but
in
general
terms
it
does
not
swell
the
revenues
of
the
city
and
to
avoid
public
scandal
is
applied
exclusively
to
the
police
and
medical
services
required
by
the
class
the
keepers
and
women
are
of
three
grades
it
does
not
clearly
appear
whether
a
woman
can
select
the
class
with
whom
she
will
associate
we
are
inclined
to
think
the
magistrates
decide
this
point
and
allot
her
to
the
one
for
which
she
seems
best
adapted
in
their
apparel
and
food
there
exists
the
usual
difference
that
may
be
found
in
all
places
and
ranks
of
life
the
police
regulations
and
the
generally
sober
style
of
dress
among
the
hamburgers
restrict
any
immodest
display
of
the
person
or
extravagance
of
attire
the
women
are
generally
costumed
with
taste
and
elegance
while
among
the
lower
ranks
plain
and
serviceable
garments
are
in
demand
in
most
cases
of
the
registered
women
residing
in
brothels
the
keeper
supplies
the
clothes
and
very
often
charges
extravagant
prices
for
them
extortionate
demands
in
this
respect
are
a
fruitful
source
of
complaints
to
the
police
who
moderate
the
bills
with
no
very
tender
sympathy
for
the
creditor
the
clothes
and
jewelry
of
some
of
the
women
are
hired
from
some
but
others
seldom
resort
to
this
expedient
excepting
for
trinkets
the
food
of
the
is
good
and
plentiful
varying
according
to
the
rate
of
the
brothel
in
which
they
live
the
old
sumptuary
laws
are
not
in
force
but
the
interest
of
the
keeper
induces
him
to
desire
a
prudent
popularity
among
his
women
and
to
maintain
the
character
of
his
house
by
the
liberality
of
his
entertainment
both
in
quantity
and
quality
a
considerable
portion
of
their
liquids
is
coffee
of
which
they
are
very
fond
wines
and
liquors
are
supplied
by
the
house
only
on
holidays
but
visitors
can
purchase
them
at
any
time
they
wish
drunkenness
is
comparatively
rare
among
the
better
class
partly
owing
to
the
care
of
the
keeper
but
more
from
dread
of
the
police
supervision
and
consequent
punishment
in
their
intellectual
capacity
there
is
nothing
to
distinguish
the
prostitutes
in
hamburg
few
can
read
and
fewer
still
can
write
those
who
can
read
seek
their
amusement
in
the
old
romances
of
the
circulating
libraries
seldom
perusing
that
libidinous
style
of
publications
known
among
us
as
literature
this
seems
the
universal
practice
of
the
class
wherever
any
inquiries
have
been
made
like
other
ignorant
persons
they
are
superstitious
lippert
mentions
one
particular
omen
connected
with
their
calling
she
who
picks
up
any
article
which
has
been
thrown
away
is
sure
to
receive
a
visit
from
a
man
soon
after
he
does
not
say
whether
this
has
been
verified
by
experience
their
ordinary
routine
of
life
is
one
of
useless
idleness
they
rise
about
ten
and
take
breakfast
of
which
coffee
is
the
staple
the
morning
is
loitered
away
in
dressing
reading
novels
playing
cards
or
dominoes
and
kindred
occupations
in
some
of
the
houses
they
dispel
their
by
assisting
in
domestic
work
but
this
is
a
matter
of
favor
which
they
are
careful
shall
not
become
an
obligation
by
the
middle
of
the
day
they
are
ready
for
dinner
in
the
afternoon
they
add
the
finishing
touches
to
their
dress
and
wait
the
arrival
of
visitors
some
resort
to
the
public
lounges
or
dancing
saloons
to
form
or
cultivate
acquaintances
but
the
aristocracy
of
the
order
hold
it
more
becoming
to
their
dignity
to
stay
at
home
and
wait
for
their
friends
in
that
fine
and
peculiar
quality
of
modesty
which
adds
the
crowning
grace
to
woman
charms
even
the
prostitute
is
not
wholly
deficient
some
trace
of
the
angel
attribute
is
visible
but
mostly
in
the
private
women
where
a
regard
for
the
decent
proprieties
of
life
yet
lingers
amid
the
wreck
of
character
and
to
such
it
frequently
forms
the
chief
attraction
religion
has
an
influence
over
some
strangely
at
variance
with
its
dictates
as
are
their
lives
but
a
large
majority
are
entirely
destitute
of
any
such
sentiment
occasionally
biblical
pictures
may
be
seen
in
the
rooms
of
brothels
but
merely
as
ornaments
for
they
are
neutralized
by
the
contiguity
of
others
more
consonant
with
the
place
in
their
relations
to
the
male
sex
there
are
differences
between
women
residing
in
public
brothels
and
those
living
privately
whether
registered
or
unregistered
partly
from
inclination
but
mainly
from
policy
on
the
part
of
the
keeper
the
former
seldom
own
allegiance
to
any
particular
lover
it
is
true
that
any
one
who
is
able
and
willing
to
pay
liberally
can
come
and
go
as
he
pleases
provided
he
does
not
interfere
with
the
girl
business
in
other
profitable
quarters
not
so
with
the
private
women
who
frequently
have
particular
lovers
to
whom
they
show
much
kindness
although
from
them
they
often
receive
but
little
sympathy
or
protection
many
of
these
men
not
scrupling
to
exist
entirely
upon
the
earnings
of
a
woman
whom
they
would
publicly
insult
if
they
met
her
away
from
home
in
their
personal
conduct
toward
each
other
the
women
residing
in
one
house
are
constrained
and
envious
in
the
first
class
there
is
a
ceremonious
retention
of
the
forms
of
politeness
but
they
are
too
frequently
brought
into
personal
rivalry
to
entertain
much
good
feeling
in
the
lower
classes
jealousy
often
finds
vent
in
reproaches
or
blows
and
frequently
a
conflict
ensues
requiring
the
interposition
of
the
host
or
of
a
neighboring
police
officer
among
those
who
live
alone
warm
friendships
are
not
uncommon
much
timely
assistance
is
afforded
in
times
of
sickness
or
want
good
offices
are
reciprocated
and
it
sometimes
happens
in
the
delicate
matter
of
their
visitors
that
a
man
who
has
been
in
the
habit
of
favoring
one
woman
will
not
find
his
attentions
welcomed
by
others
their
crimes
and
offenses
include
the
ordinary
category
but
it
is
asserted
that
theft
is
less
common
in
hamburg
than
elsewhere
and
when
it
does
take
place
it
is
more
frequently
committed
by
the
irregular
members
of
the
body
than
by
the
duly
registered
women
it
will
be
perceived
that
the
system
of
registration
offers
too
many
facilities
for
detection
a
fact
to
which
the
unusual
honesty
must
doubtless
be
ascribed
personal
quarrels
and
assaults
or
drunkenness
among
the
older
members
consign
them
to
the
house
of
detention
or
house
of
correction
those
imprisoned
from
various
causes
generally
amount
to
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
the
licensed
brothels
are
supplied
with
inmates
by
females
whose
services
are
recognized
by
the
authorities
in
case
of
any
emergency
the
keeper
applies
to
one
of
the
procuresses
and
if
the
girl
she
offers
suits
him
the
candidate
is
first
subjected
to
a
medical
examination
passed
safely
through
this
ordeal
she
is
taken
to
the
police
office
and
written
in
to
her
new
keeper
who
is
bound
to
discharge
certain
of
her
debts
as
the
amount
due
his
predecessor
for
instance
if
the
medical
officers
report
her
sick
she
is
sent
to
the
infirmary
if
she
belong
to
hamburg
but
if
a
foreigner
is
dispatched
out
of
the
city
forthwith
in
cases
where
a
woman
thus
applying
to
the
authorities
has
not
previously
lived
as
a
prostitute
she
is
usually
exhorted
by
the
magistrate
to
abandon
her
intention
and
return
to
the
paths
of
virtue
a
routine
piece
of
benevolence
which
is
usually
fruitless
the
ordinary
police
fee
for
registration
is
two
marks
the
physician
fee
is
one
mark
and
the
agent
usual
remuneration
four
marks
the
registered
women
are
thus
kept
strictly
under
the
eye
of
the
police
and
whenever
they
are
disposed
to
quit
their
wretched
life
have
the
special
protection
of
that
body
the
keepers
naturally
throw
all
possible
obstacles
in
the
way
of
such
a
determination
especially
if
a
girl
is
much
in
debt
but
by
some
means
whenever
a
woman
is
under
any
restraint
and
is
consequently
unable
to
apply
personally
to
the
police
an
anonymous
note
finds
its
way
to
the
office
and
speedily
effects
the
desired
object
the
authorities
do
not
sympathize
in
any
way
with
the
but
use
all
their
energies
to
serve
the
women
whenever
any
occasion
offers
the
registered
women
are
designated
as
brothel
women
who
live
in
licensed
houses
as
private
women
sich
wohnende
when
they
live
by
themselves
in
which
case
their
landlords
are
mostly
mechanics
hucksters
or
laundresses
and
the
common
who
ply
their
trade
in
the
streets
and
find
shelter
in
the
abodes
of
indigence
and
misery
these
last
are
the
lowest
grade
of
the
registered
women
most
of
the
brothels
are
in
the
oldest
parts
of
the
city
to
which
they
were
originally
limited
but
the
leading
houses
may
be
found
in
the
a
street
of
moderate
traffic
in
a
good
neighborhood
here
the
women
are
seated
at
the
windows
conspicuously
dressed
up
and
prepared
for
the
public
eye
making
themselves
known
to
passengers
by
their
gestures
and
salutations
some
of
these
houses
accommodate
as
many
as
fourteen
inmates
they
are
well
supplied
with
good
mahogany
furniture
and
fine
draperies
and
are
neat
and
elegant
throughout
the
women
are
generally
from
twenty
to
years
old
and
are
attractively
dressed
and
decorated
the
venereal
disease
is
very
rare
among
this
class
great
attention
being
paid
to
personal
cleanliness
and
the
bath
very
frequently
used
the
men
who
visit
this
neighborhood
consist
of
merchants
the
richer
public
and
business
employés
officers
and
especially
the
numerous
commercial
men
who
resort
to
hamburg
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
the
denizens
of
the
the
and
lead
but
a
dull
life
as
it
is
the
custom
in
those
localities
for
the
women
to
sit
at
the
windows
all
day
their
great
diurnal
event
is
the
visit
of
the
who
while
contributing
to
the
adornment
of
the
person
a
very
serious
affair
owing
to
the
quantity
of
false
hair
required
and
the
necessity
of
making
effect
vary
from
yesterday
also
retails
the
latest
items
of
interesting
news
or
scandal
whenever
any
of
these
women
go
out
to
walk
it
is
customary
for
the
keeper
to
send
together
two
who
are
at
variance
with
each
other
so
as
to
establish
a
mutual
check
the
and
walk
over
the
next
important
occurrence
is
dinner
after
which
they
spend
their
time
solely
at
the
doors
or
windows
the
hours
of
closing
in
these
first
and
second
rate
brothels
are
not
so
strictly
enforced
by
the
police
as
in
the
lower
parts
occasionally
the
women
are
allowed
to
visit
the
balls
at
the
celebrated
hall
of
mirrors
or
other
dancing
saloons
in
the
vicinity
in
houses
the
accounts
between
the
keeper
and
the
women
are
but
little
understood
as
already
observed
some
of
them
hire
their
clothes
others
purchase
from
the
landlord
on
credit
and
he
charges
accordingly
but
these
matters
trouble
the
women
very
slightly
if
they
leave
one
house
to
reside
in
another
the
new
keeper
pays
the
old
one
bill
if
a
woman
abandons
prostitution
entirely
the
host
demand
is
totally
irrecoverable
in
the
second
and
third
rate
houses
the
charges
for
board
and
lodging
are
better
understood
it
will
average
about
twenty
marks
five
dollars
a
week
washing
fire
and
light
being
extra
charges
the
keeper
will
supply
fortunate
or
attractive
women
with
articles
of
dress
to
any
reasonable
amount
but
his
liberality
is
restricted
toward
those
who
have
fewer
visitors
his
endeavor
is
to
keep
all
in
debt
and
in
this
he
is
usually
successful
their
ornaments
are
usually
the
property
of
the
landlord
and
form
a
common
stock
distributed
among
his
boarders
in
the
manner
best
calculated
to
increase
or
display
their
powers
of
fascination
and
resumed
by
him
at
discretion
passing
over
some
intermediate
classes
of
brothels
which
present
no
remarkable
characteristics
to
those
in
the
we
find
the
lowest
grade
of
registered
houses
and
registered
women
most
of
these
are
and
the
police
exercise
the
right
of
determining
the
prices
to
be
charged
for
liquors
here
may
frequently
be
seen
host
guests
and
girls
drinking
and
frolicking
together
in
a
small
back
room
where
scenes
of
gross
indelicacy
to
use
a
mild
term
frequently
take
place
the
women
in
this
district
have
literally
to
work
hard
and
are
generally
required
to
perform
all
the
domestic
labor
of
the
establishment
in
winter
it
is
a
common
occurrence
for
them
to
take
a
shovel
and
clear
the
snow
and
ice
from
the
pavement
in
front
of
their
domicile
like
others
of
their
calling
they
are
seldom
out
of
the
landlord
debt
their
board
costing
them
from
ten
to
fourteen
marks
weekly
say
three
to
four
dollars
washing
fire
and
light
cost
a
dollar
more
and
the
charge
is
about
fifty
cents
in
addition
to
this
they
must
pay
the
weekly
medical
and
monthly
police
tax
they
spend
a
miserably
monotonous
existence
seldom
leaving
the
house
for
weeks
or
even
months
except
when
they
are
required
to
visit
the
doctors
or
the
police
their
visitors
are
from
the
roughest
and
most
animalized
of
the
population
and
the
treatment
they
receive
is
merely
that
of
purchasable
commodities
intended
to
supply
the
grosser
wants
of
men
whose
lives
are
centred
in
sensuality
like
their
compeers
of
the
paul
suburb
they
are
usually
women
of
great
strength
and
endurance
but
soon
degenerate
into
mere
passive
passionless
tools
could
it
be
imagined
that
they
were
of
reflective
habits
it
would
be
impossible
to
conceive
a
more
severe
punishment
than
their
own
sense
of
the
degradation
the
total
loss
of
all
womanly
feelings
exhibited
in
their
daily
existence
the
among
whom
are
some
jews
have
no
striking
peculiarities
as
a
class
it
has
been
already
shown
that
both
sexes
are
engaged
in
the
hideous
trade
and
despite
the
police
regulations
and
restrictions
the
obligations
and
disabilities
under
which
they
are
placed
it
is
undoubtedly
a
most
lucrative
occupation
the
rental
of
a
registered
house
is
usually
double
the
ordinary
charge
for
similar
tenements
there
are
some
keepers
who
own
the
houses
in
which
they
live
in
their
liabilities
must
be
included
the
regulation
which
makes
them
responsible
for
thefts
committed
in
their
houses
and
for
any
violence
or
disorder
which
may
take
place
there
the
penalties
for
which
are
fine
imprisonment
and
loss
of
license
they
also
sustain
considerable
losses
from
the
repentance
of
some
of
their
inmates
but
in
spite
of
all
untoward
circumstances
they
contrive
to
make
money
rapidly
the
period
during
which
they
continue
in
is
uncertain
many
of
them
continuing
their
houses
from
inclination
long
after
they
have
accumulated
sufficient
property
to
retire
of
the
female
keepers
some
are
young
and
handsome
but
these
do
not
find
much
favor
with
their
women
who
dread
the
effects
of
an
opposition
they
are
rarely
married
but
cohabit
with
some
man
for
the
sake
of
his
protection
among
these
husbands
are
some
whose
qualifications
and
previous
positions
render
it
surprising
that
they
should
consent
to
purchase
existence
from
so
polluted
a
source
the
housekeepers
of
the
hamburger
berg
are
not
only
under
a
separate
municipal
jurisdiction
but
are
in
themselves
a
different
class
of
people
they
are
mostly
men
their
dealings
being
principally
with
sailors
and
their
visitors
sometimes
demanding
more
physical
strength
than
a
woman
could
command
to
restrain
them
within
the
prescribed
limits
their
houses
are
but
indifferently
furnished
and
the
whole
arrangements
are
very
humble
and
unpretending
in
character
a
few
years
ago
fatal
quarrels
were
not
uncommon
among
their
customers
but
this
pugnacious
tendency
has
been
materially
checked
by
a
stricter
and
more
constant
police
visitation
even
now
jealousy
will
sometimes
cause
a
furious
contest
between
two
of
the
hardy
sons
of
neptune
the
singular
fidelity
of
some
sailors
to
particular
women
will
account
for
this
when
a
man
returns
from
a
long
voyage
he
is
desirous
of
paying
his
attentions
to
the
female
who
has
before
shared
his
affections
and
his
wages
and
if
he
finds
her
under
the
protection
of
another
man
the
natural
result
is
a
trial
of
strength
as
to
who
shall
be
the
possessor
of
the
beauty
in
dispute
these
tournaments
or
the
general
fray
which
sometimes
arises
at
the
close
of
the
sunday
evening
dance
require
to
be
subdued
by
no
gentle
means
hearty
blows
are
far
more
effectual
than
words
or
threats
some
of
these
registered
hosts
have
followed
their
calling
for
many
years
one
noble
incident
in
connection
with
them
must
not
be
omitted
in
the
severe
winter
of
the
landlord
of
the
four
lions
a
of
years
standing
maintained
at
his
own
cost
for
some
months
nearly
one
hundred
poor
families
many
of
them
with
three
or
four
children
each
in
the
there
is
music
every
evening
except
saturday
on
from
six
to
eleven
and
on
sundays
from
four
to
eleven
at
eleven
the
music
is
stopped
and
at
twelve
the
house
is
peremptorily
closed
the
evenings
during
the
week
are
comparatively
dull
affairs
and
male
visitors
are
sometimes
so
scarce
that
the
women
are
compelled
to
dance
with
each
other
or
sit
in
inglorious
idleness
a
scene
of
the
wildest
uproar
and
most
uncontrolled
mirth
is
exhibited
on
sunday
evenings
every
variety
of
national
dance
may
then
be
seen
cachucha
reel
jig
waltz
and
hornpipe
have
each
their
several
admirers
songs
and
shouts
are
heard
in
every
conceivable
dialect
and
the
room
becomes
literally
confusion
worse
confounded
until
the
hour
arrives
for
closing
of
the
registered
women
living
by
themselves
there
is
little
to
note
they
are
more
industrious
than
those
in
brothels
many
of
them
have
a
fixed
occupation
but
resort
to
prostitution
to
increase
their
income
money
earned
in
this
way
is
occasionally
required
for
the
common
necessaries
of
life
but
is
more
frequently
spent
in
personal
gratification
in
the
way
of
fine
dresses
ornaments
or
is
appropriated
to
support
the
extravagance
of
some
lover
who
repays
the
generosity
by
a
little
flattering
attention
or
an
occasional
escort
to
some
dancing
saloon
in
the
suburbs
the
visitors
to
these
women
are
more
select
than
those
to
the
courtesans
hitherto
described
in
the
lowest
ranks
of
prostitution
the
common
to
be
met
at
all
times
and
places
under
all
circumstances
and
of
all
ages
we
find
the
most
prolific
sources
of
infection
a
certain
though
very
small
remnant
of
decency
seconded
by
the
invaluable
watchfulness
of
the
police
secures
the
visitor
from
disease
among
the
inmates
of
registered
houses
but
the
is
under
no
such
control
young
girls
scarcely
more
than
children
old
women
almost
grandmothers
ply
their
frightful
trade
on
the
walls
around
the
city
and
in
other
obscure
places
where
a
trifling
present
will
purchase
their
caresses
their
principal
customers
are
young
boys
and
very
old
men
their
practices
being
continued
under
the
shades
of
evening
until
the
arrival
of
the
drives
them
to
their
wretched
dens
the
hamburg
police
are
perfectly
cognizant
of
these
proceedings
and
wage
perpetual
war
against
individuals
but
find
it
altogether
impossible
to
suppress
the
class
among
whom
are
the
habitual
tenants
of
the
jail
and
the
house
of
correction
no
one
can
differ
in
opinion
from
lippert
who
says
in
this
class
of
women
the
most
pernicious
results
of
prostitution
are
to
be
found
private
or
domestic
prostitution
so
widely
extended
in
every
great
town
exists
in
less
proportion
in
hamburg
than
in
other
capital
cities
of
the
same
extent
that
disgraceful
union
in
evil
occasionally
met
with
on
the
continent
in
which
husband
and
wife
mutually
agree
to
follow
their
inclinations
or
lusts
untrammeled
by
each
other
is
scarcely
known
the
kept
woman
is
comparatively
rare
the
expense
attendant
upon
such
an
appendage
of
luxury
is
a
serious
consideration
and
none
but
the
wealthy
patrician
or
successful
business
man
venture
on
the
step
it
is
assumed
on
very
good
authority
that
there
are
not
fifty
mistresses
in
hamburg
those
residing
there
are
under
no
police
control
as
in
a
public
point
of
view
they
commit
no
breach
of
law
under
the
second
head
of
private
prostitution
we
find
those
who
having
legitimate
employment
increase
their
earnings
in
this
manner
we
have
alluded
already
to
the
same
class
of
registered
women
but
the
greater
portion
keep
themselves
aloof
from
police
observation
as
long
as
possible
they
are
composed
of
laundresses
and
others
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
they
represent
the
majority
of
women
dependent
upon
those
occupations
the
contrary
is
the
fact
for
in
hamburg
as
every
where
else
are
to
be
found
many
bright
examples
of
chastity
in
the
midst
of
poverty
of
patient
persevering
industry
and
integrity
in
unfavorable
circumstances
those
working
women
who
are
willing
to
accept
the
price
of
sin
are
known
in
the
streets
by
a
peculiar
gait
by
their
searching
and
inviting
glances
or
their
treacherous
but
winning
smile
and
also
by
frequently
walking
in
the
same
neighborhood
they
are
seldom
seen
abroad
during
the
day
but
in
the
afternoon
about
hours
they
begin
to
resort
to
the
streets
near
the
encountering
the
men
as
they
hurry
to
and
from
the
centre
of
business
in
the
evening
they
promenade
in
the
vicinity
of
the
hotels
and
theatres
on
the
the
new
walls
when
night
helps
their
and
shrouds
them
in
a
little
more
mystery
they
are
fond
of
attending
the
theatres
and
dancing
saloons
on
sundays
and
holidays
like
the
parisian
in
company
with
a
lover
but
the
sum
of
their
enjoyment
is
complete
if
they
can
participate
in
the
annual
shrove
tuesday
ball
and
masquerade
at
the
apollo
saal
the
elb
pavilion
or
the
theatre
another
class
of
private
prostitutes
is
known
to
the
police
by
the
term
hedge
w
these
are
of
the
lower
class
of
female
operatives
from
their
proximity
to
the
junior
members
of
families
often
spread
disease
in
the
household
of
their
employers
lippert
records
as
a
medical
fact
that
examinations
have
frequently
shown
the
domestics
in
the
highest
families
to
be
literally
saturated
with
venereal
disease
and
he
states
his
opinion
that
six
out
of
every
ten
who
are
found
in
the
streets
at
night
are
accessible
to
pecuniary
temptation
this
ratio
is
very
large
but
as
it
is
a
local
matter
with
which
he
is
presumed
to
be
well
acquainted
it
would
be
out
of
place
to
attempt
either
to
sustain
or
controvert
it
all
these
private
prostitutes
resort
to
the
houses
of
accommodation
which
exist
in
spite
of
the
constant
watchfulness
of
the
police
when
they
are
hunted
up
and
rooted
out
of
one
place
they
reappear
under
another
guise
elsewhere
a
removal
being
facilitated
by
the
slender
nature
of
their
equipment
which
seldom
consists
of
more
than
furniture
for
one
room
for
genteel
delinquents
they
are
placed
where
the
accommodation
is
veiled
under
the
french
disguise
of
or
some
such
flimsy
artifice
to
the
question
what
becomes
of
the
prostitutes
hamburg
offers
no
special
reply
under
favorable
circumstances
they
abandon
their
calling
and
become
the
wives
of
mechanics
or
small
tradesmen
or
they
carry
on
some
business
for
themselves
and
strive
to
become
reputable
members
of
society
or
they
become
companion
to
some
man
and
follow
his
fortunes
usually
reverting
to
common
prostitution
when
their
charms
are
entirely
lost
and
no
hope
remains
of
earning
a
living
from
their
sale
they
sometimes
but
very
rarely
become
sometimes
procuresses
and
more
frequently
servants
in
the
registered
houses
some
of
the
dancing
saloons
already
mentioned
have
attained
european
celebrity
they
stand
in
the
same
relation
to
common
women
as
the
exchange
does
to
the
mercantile
community
their
female
visitors
are
mostly
prostitutes
a
fact
which
deprives
the
scene
of
many
fascinations
existing
in
other
cities
in
the
end
of
the
last
century
there
was
no
public
place
expressly
designed
for
dancing
until
with
the
many
equivocal
blessings
disseminated
by
the
french
revolution
they
also
became
an
institution
the
hamburg
saloons
are
conducted
with
order
and
quiet
and
are
generally
closed
about
one
in
the
morning
one
of
the
most
important
the
bacchus
hall
was
burned
down
some
few
years
since
and
the
authorities
have
as
yet
refused
to
grant
a
license
for
its
as
public
places
which
in
some
degree
facilitate
prostitution
mention
must
be
made
of
the
common
sleeping
apartments
locally
called
deep
cellars
these
are
roomy
vaults
many
feet
under
ground
in
which
the
poor
find
nightly
shelter
at
very
low
prices
they
are
provided
with
beds
and
bedding
in
the
depth
of
poverty
to
which
some
of
their
customers
have
fallen
they
can
not
afford
to
pay
two
schellings
about
four
cents
for
the
luxury
of
a
bed
and
these
repose
their
weary
limbs
on
some
foul
straw
or
on
the
ground
at
the
charge
of
half
a
schelling
some
of
these
cellars
are
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
street
and
it
will
not
require
a
very
vivid
imagination
to
portray
their
horrors
the
beer
and
wine
houses
of
hamburg
are
tolerably
free
from
prostitution
but
a
new
class
has
lately
sprung
up
called
and
in
these
the
guests
are
served
by
females
in
fancy
costume
swiss
polish
or
circassian
as
the
case
may
be
many
of
these
contain
private
rooms
for
prostitution
and
although
they
are
closely
watched
by
the
police
who
sometimes
ungallantly
expel
the
fair
foreigners
and
close
the
establishments
they
still
flourish
others
being
speedily
opened
elsewhere
to
fill
up
the
gap
from
this
general
description
of
prostitutes
their
habitations
and
customs
we
will
proceed
to
a
consideration
of
their
condition
as
to
health
and
the
extent
and
virulence
of
syphilis
among
them
still
taking
the
pamphlet
of
lippert
for
our
guide
it
is
generally
imagined
that
the
excessive
action
of
the
generative
organs
interferes
with
the
power
of
procreation
in
common
women
lippert
undertakes
to
controvert
this
opinion
with
what
success
medical
men
whose
professional
experience
has
been
among
this
class
will
be
able
to
judge
he
supports
his
views
by
general
assertions
rather
than
by
specific
facts
but
refers
in
corroboration
to
instances
in
which
children
have
been
born
while
the
mothers
were
living
in
a
state
of
open
prostitution
as
also
to
those
cases
where
women
who
have
abandoned
the
habit
of
promiscuous
intercourse
confine
themselves
to
one
man
by
marriage
or
cohabitation
and
then
become
mothers
he
attributes
their
sterility
during
prostitution
to
their
wild
and
irregular
life
their
constant
exposure
to
weather
and
argues
that
the
powers
of
conception
are
suspended
but
not
destroyed
thereby
he
also
introduces
the
fact
that
abortions
are
frequently
produced
in
hamburg
by
the
common
women
themselves
or
by
some
old
crones
who
preside
over
their
orgies
and
are
stated
to
have
a
long
list
of
drugs
applicable
to
this
purpose
which
they
use
in
a
reckless
manner
the
medical
police
are
not
unaware
of
these
proceedings
but
find
them
difficult
to
detect
as
a
woman
will
endeavor
to
avoid
the
stated
examination
by
pleading
excessive
menstruation
or
inventing
some
story
she
thinks
likely
to
deceive
until
all
traces
of
the
abortion
are
removed
the
remarks
of
lippert
would
lead
to
the
belief
that
the
of
the
female
organs
was
more
favorable
to
health
than
the
disuse
would
be
a
conclusion
which
most
physicians
will
not
be
willing
to
admit
he
adds
cancer
of
the
womb
occurred
but
once
in
my
experience
of
eleven
years
at
the
general
infirmary
and
cases
of
prolapsus
uteri
are
very
rare
a
disease
incident
to
common
women
w
colic
happens
in
hamburg
as
elsewhere
but
is
attributed
to
exposure
to
the
weather
more
than
any
other
cause
it
consists
of
pain
in
the
womb
extending
across
the
abdomen
round
to
the
loins
and
sometimes
including
the
whole
region
of
the
stomach
it
is
frequently
accompanied
with
gastric
derangement
sickness
or
diarrhoea
the
enlargement
of
the
clitoris
so
much
insisted
on
by
some
writers
lippert
altogether
doubts
except
as
a
very
exceptional
case
nor
does
he
admit
any
effect
of
prostitution
on
the
rectum
unless
induced
by
unnatural
intercourse
as
a
general
result
of
his
observations
he
concludes
that
apart
from
syphilitic
affections
the
generative
organs
of
a
prostitute
do
not
usually
differ
from
those
of
a
virtuous
woman
we
find
some
returns
of
diseases
not
directly
connected
with
prostitution
thus
cases
of
itch
which
is
now
becoming
rare
were
in
of
other
general
maladies
including
fevers
inflammation
of
the
lungs
liver
womb
rheumatism
piles
jaundice
gout
dropsy
and
diarrhoea
the
following
are
reported
convulsions
are
more
rare
than
in
the
female
sex
in
general
of
hysteria
there
is
scarcely
a
trace
and
a
few
cases
of
epilepsy
are
ascribed
to
the
use
of
ardent
spirits
delirium
tremens
seldom
occurs
the
vigilance
of
the
police
and
the
prompt
committal
to
prison
of
every
prostitute
found
drunk
and
disorderly
may
account
for
this
the
proportion
of
cases
of
delirium
tremens
was
only
about
one
in
one
thousand
mania
sometimes
shows
itself
remorse
may
produce
this
as
may
a
violent
affection
for
some
particular
man
of
the
actual
extent
of
venereal
disease
in
hamburg
or
any
other
city
it
is
impossible
to
speak
with
certainty
but
the
fact
that
in
the
general
hospital
there
it
is
of
a
very
mild
type
is
an
argument
in
favor
of
medical
inspection
lippert
says
the
usual
form
is
gonorrhoea
with
its
complications
bubo
inflammation
of
the
scrotum
phymosis
paraphymosis
etc
inflammation
of
the
prostate
gland
and
stricture
are
comparatively
rare
disease
of
the
rectum
is
very
rare
but
there
are
examples
we
have
excoriations
and
irritations
of
the
sexual
organs
the
simple
chancre
is
common
the
indurated
chancre
not
unfrequent
the
phagedænic
chancre
is
seldom
met
with
in
general
the
sores
have
a
mild
character
and
heal
easily
with
simple
treatment
and
regular
topical
applications
is
extremely
general
this
is
a
group
of
small
pustules
quickly
healing
up
but
as
quickly
breaking
out
again
often
in
regular
periodical
recurrence
it
is
found
especially
on
men
who
have
suffered
from
gonorrhoea
or
chancre
secondary
syphilis
ulcers
of
the
neck
eruptions
syphilitic
inflammation
of
the
eyes
tumors
etc
these
prevail
more
at
some
times
than
at
others
how
far
the
the
weather
and
season
the
idiosyncrasy
of
the
person
or
the
intensity
of
the
infection
operate
we
have
yet
to
learn
syphilis
is
in
it
is
often
observable
that
the
disease
takes
peculiar
aspects
and
what
may
be
called
exotic
forms
are
occasionally
encountered
with
sailors
syphilis
is
frequently
latent
or
only
partially
cured
and
is
intensified
by
their
habits
and
diet
sexual
intercourse
with
them
will
produce
it
in
an
exaggerated
character
this
is
not
so
much
the
case
in
hamburg
owing
to
the
constant
and
prompt
medical
attention
still
some
distinction
is
observable
between
the
venereal
maladies
of
the
city
women
and
those
of
the
paul
suburb
among
the
latter
the
cases
of
a
malignant
type
generally
occur
the
negro
sailor
is
held
in
very
bad
repute
by
these
women
and
some
keepers
will
not
allow
him
to
enter
their
houses
believing
that
infection
from
a
colored
man
is
of
the
worst
kind
and
almost
incurable
the
medical
returns
for
the
year
give
the
following
tables
relating
to
the
women
in
the
paul
suburb
in
january
there
were
women
of
whom
were
sick
the
diseases
were
venereal
disease
itch
colic
gastric
fever
rheumatic
fever
catarrh
of
lungs
calculus
total
in
may
of
women
were

were

venereal

itch
sprain

disorder

total
this
would
give
an
average
of
about
ten
per
cent
of
the
women
of
the
suburb
sick
from
the
facts
we
have
quoted
it
is
evident
that
the
virulence
of
syphilitic
affections
among
the
registered
women
is
unquestionably
mitigated
syphilis
is
secondary
syphilis
but
occasional
while
primary
forms
have
lost
their
malignity
there
is
a
marked
aggravation
of
the
disease
during
the
summer
months
when
a
considerable
influx
of
strangers
takes
place
this
was
particularly
observable
after
the
great
fire
in
mildness
of
the
disease
and
its
easy
control
can
be
ascribed
to
nothing
but
the
weekly
medical
supervision
the
women
are
visited
at
their
own
houses
and
any
reluctance
or
refusal
renders
them
liable
to
contrasted
with
this
state
of
affairs
we
have
the
severity
of
syphilis
among
unregistered
women
who
conceal
their
disease
as
long
as
they
can
of
those
arrested
many
are
found
to
be
diseased
in
an
aggravated
form
in
the
year
of
unregistered
women
sent
to
prison
had
syphilis
or
nearly
one
third
of
the
whole
says
this
proportion
is
exceeded
by
the
same
class
in
paris
where
the
infected
amount
to
one
half
the
illicit
prostitutes
the
is
a
medical
institution
especially
designed
for
bad
characters
who
are
arrested
by
the
police
be
they
registered
or
unregistered
the
general
infirmary
has
also
a
venereal
ward
the
police
authorities
contribute
annually
from
the
amount
raised
by
the
impost
on
brothels
and
prostitutes
marks
to
the
funds
of
this
infirmary
from
the
following
facts
this
would
seem
an
inadequate
amount
in
there
were
received
and
treated
females
with
syphilis
the
total
residence
amounting
to
days
or
a
average
of
days
each
the
stipend
allowed
for
which
service
would
be
about
and
a
half
cents
per
the
number
of
female
cases
of
syphilis
received
into
the
same
institution
in
was
registered
women
unregistered
women
total
and
in
registered
women
unregistered
women
total
the
state
of
the
male
venereal
patients
proves
the
same
general
amelioration
in
the
character
of
the
disease
the
cases
however
are
worse
than
among
the
registered
women
which
must
be
ascribed
to
the

all
that
ends
this
strange
eventful
history
before
dismissing
this
subject
we
will
give
a
sketch
of
the
hamburg
magdalen
hospital
this
institution
was
founded
in
through
the
exertions
of
the
burgomaster
abendroth
and
others
and
was
constructed
on
the
model
of
a
similar
asylum
in
london
the
object
is
to
reclaim
women
from
vice
by
means
that
can
be
applied
only
in
a
place
expressly
dedicated
to
the
purpose
the
number
of
inmates
is
small
only
twelve
can
be
received
the
business
of
the
asylum
is
conducted
by
a
committee
including
two
ministers
a
physician
three
female
overseers
and
a
matron
the
overseers
are
respectable
married
women
or
widows
who
voluntarily
undertake
the
duties
of
a
they
assume
the
direction
of
the
household
affairs
alternately
for
a
month
each
they
meet
frequently
at
the
house
assist
in
divine
service
and
take
care
of
the
girls
who
are
discharged
these
are
provided
with
situations
or
placed
in
business
and
require
to
be
upheld
and
maintained
in
their
new
character
the
chaplain
assists
the
ladies
committee
in
their
duties
but
directs
his
energies
particularly
to
the
religious
instruction
of
the
inmates
frequent
meetings
for
prayer
are
held
and
every
half
year
the
sacrament
is
administered
to
such
as
he
deems
duly
prepared
to
receive
it
and
who
have
a
competent
knowledge
of
its
importance
and
efficacy
to
be
qualified
for
admission
the
applicant
must
be
young
and
must
have
a
desire
to
amend
the
limited
room
will
not
allow
the
reception
of
old
or
women
who
would
flock
there
in
crowds
to
obtain
a
shelter
under
which
they
could
die
in
peace
when
a
woman
application
is
granted
she
must
go
through
a
novitiate
of
four
or
eight
weeks
during
this
time
she
works
and
eats
with
the
other
inmates
but
sleeps
alone
and
is
closely
watched
by
a
member
of
the
committee
when
her
novitiate
expires
and
she
is
fully
received
she
is
requested
to
give
an
explicit
account
of
her
life
every
particular
of
which
is
recorded
her
name
is
not
disclosed
to
her
companions
but
she
as
are
all
the
others
is
known
only
by
a
christian
name
the
women
are
employed
in
all
kinds
of
housework
needlework
or
when
practicable
in
any
manner
which
will
accustom
them
to
continued
physical
exertion
their
previous
life
having
made
indolence
almost
second
nature
this
course
is
adopted
to
inculcate
the
necessity
of
industry
a
strict
account
of
the
produce
of
their
labor
is
kept
and
a
portion
is
set
apart
as
a
fund
for
their
benefit
the
time
of
their
stay
is
usually
about
two
years
when
they
leave
they
give
the
chaplain
a
written
promise
of
good
conduct
and
receive
from
him
a
bible
and
a
and
the
sum
of
money
accumulated
for
them
the
results
of
this
benevolent
attempt
are
sufficient
to
encourage
the
laborers
in
the
good
work
and
we
can
not
but
think
that
their
endeavors
must
be
productive
of
great
good
based
as
they
are
upon
the
sound
principle
of
receiving
but
a
few
women
and
treating
them
as
members
of
one
family
in
opposition
to
the
general
theory
of
such
institutions
whose
managers
attempt
to
crowd
in
as
large
a
number
as
a
large
building
will
contain
and
in
the
endeavor
to
generalize
rules
for
reformation
lose
the
valuable
opportunities
for

intercourse
was
looked
upon
as
enervating
to
youth
and
discreditable
or
even
disgraceful
to
men
until
their
valor
had
been
proved
by
deeds
of
arms
and
their
experience
authorized
them
to
assume
the
duties
of
husbands
and
fathers
in
the
middle
ages
when
the
legislative
and
executive
functions
were
vested
in
one
individual
and
the
rights
and
obligations
of
the
governing
power
were
of
a
paternal
or
patriarchal
character
we
find
much
of
their
directed
to
the
preservation
of
morality
the
repression
of
extravagance
and
the
minute
regulation
of
public
economy
in
their
edicts
against
prostitution
this
paternal
spirit
was
visible
in
conjunction
with
what
may
be
considered
a
due
regard
to
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
the
punishments
being
professedly
directed
against
a
breach
of
morality
or
a
public
scandal
because
it
was
a
disgrace
to
families
and
a
peril
to
husbands
and
fathers
rather
than
a
vice
in
itself
the
provisions
tacitly
sanctioned
its
existence
and
while
they
severely
punished
any
invasion
of
domestic
peace
or
infraction
of
marital
rights
it
seems
to
be
conceded
that
when
no
such
relationships
were
involved
illicit
intercourse
was
regarded
as
an
allowable
solace
or
an
actual
necessity
for
the
physical
requirements
of
unmarried
men
we
learn
from
the
german
historian
fiducin
beitrage
zur
geschichte
der
stadt
that
the
german
laws
rendered
it
obligatory
on
every
honorable
man
to
espouse
a
virtuous
maiden
and
the
term
illegitimate
child
was
the
bitterest
form
of
reproach
the
early
statutes
were
very
severe
in
the
punishment
of
immodest
females
and
some
carried
this
principle
so
far
as
to
require
that
a
woman
who
led
an
unchaste
life
in
her
father
house
should
be
burned
at
the
stake
the
ecclesiastical
legislation
moderated
this
severity
and
crimes
against
morality
became
sins
which
were
expiated
by
public
penance
the
citizens
of
berlin
became
convinced
that
the
penances
of
the
church
were
not
sufficiently
potent
to
counteract
the
evil
the
morals
of
the
clergy
themselves
being
frequently
impeached
and
secular
government
was
suggested
in
place
of
ecclesiastical
this
seemed
especially
necessary
because
the
canon
law
which
ordained
the
celibacy
of
the
priesthood
pronounced
it
to
be
a
work
of
mercy
to
marry
an
erring
woman
in
opposition
to
the
berlin
sheriff
law
declaring
the
children
of
such
marriages
illegitimate
and
persons
were
not
wanting
who
held
the
opinion
that
the
work
of
mercy
recommended
by
the
church
was
at
times
advocated
by
the
clergy
as
a
means
of
covering
their
own
frailties
the
same
writer
records
instances
as
late
as
the
close
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
which
adultery
was
punished
by
death
the
offenders
in
each
case
being
married
persons
he
also
cites
the
records
of
the
fourteenth
century
to
show
that
the
same
punishment
was
inflicted
on
those
who
acted
as
procurers
or
procuresses
wherever
family
honor
was
encroached
on
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
law
required
that
an
immodest
woman
belonging
to
any
reputable
family
should
be
publicly
shorn
of
her
hair
and
condemned
to
wear
a
linen
veil
nor
was
any
distinction
made
between
unmarried
women
and
widows
against
whom
the
offense
was
proved
about
the
same
period
the
trade
guilds
enacted
stringent
laws
prohibiting
the
admission
of
improper
characters
to
their
public
festivals
and
restraining
their
members
from
marrying
women
of
that
class
to
attain
this
end
any
master
tradesman
who
designed
to
marry
was
compelled
to
introduce
his
intended
bride
at
a
meeting
of
the
company
that
all
might
be
convinced
of
her
discreet
character
and
conduct
and
any
who
married
without
observing
this
requirement
were
expelled
the
association
the
guilds
inflicted
the
same
penalties
on
any
of
their
members
who
had
intercourse
with
improper
characters
or
who
seduced
a
virtuous
woman
and
subsequently
married
her
a
certain
recognition
of
the
existence
of
public
women
may
be
traced
throughout
these
regulations
which
appear
to
have
admitted
the
necessity
from
regard
to
the
rigorously
enforced
sanctity
of
the
domestic
circle
but
at
the
same
time
endeavored
to
prevent
the
increase
of
immorality
by
attaching
odium
to
its
followers
again
turning
to
the
pages
of
fiducin
we
find
that
in
all
the
great
towns
of
the
german
empire
the
public
protection
of
women
of
pleasure
seems
to
have
been
a
regular
thing
in
proof
of
which
he
says
did
a
creditor
in
taking
proceedings
against
his
debtor
find
it
necessary
to
put
up
at
an
inn
one
of
the
allowed
items
of
his
expenditure
was
a
reasonable
sum
for
the
company
of
a
woman
during
his
stay
this
was
a
question
of
state
etiquette
in
berlin
in
a
sum
having
been
officially
expended
in
that
year
to
retain
some
handsome
women
to
grace
a
public
festival
and
banquet
given
to
a
distinguished
guest
diedrich
quitzow
whose
the
citizens
desired
to
cultivate
during
this
period
of
toleration
the
expediency
of
controlling
public
women
was
unquestioned
but
the
first
berlin
enactment
of
material
importance
to
this
investigation
bears
date
in
and
is
remarkable
as
clearly
enunciating
the
principles
which
have
been
adhered
to
with
only
a
short
interval
ever
since
the
first
section
declares
by
law
this
traffic
is
decidedly
not
permitted
but
simply
tolerated
as
a
necessary
evil

and
require
the
keeper
of
any
house
of

to
give
notice
to
the
commissary

his
women
leave
him

when
he
receives

new

the
purpose

protecting
the
health

as
well
as
that
of
the
women
themselves
that
every
woman
shall
pay
him
two
groschen
for
each
visit
and
that
upon
observing
the
slightest
signs
of
disease
the
surgeon
shall
require
the
housekeeper
to
detain
the
woman
in
her
room

for
the
entire

so
far
infected

can
not

and
provide
that
the
debts
of
a
woman
must
be
paid
before
she
can
remove
from
one
house

prostitution
to
another

the
benefit
of
the
the

not

clause
is
the
noticeable
feature
in
these
regulations
and
indicates
the
policy
which
was
then
generally
adopted
throughout
the
kingdom
in
reference
to
the
period
succeeding
the
issue
of
these
rules
which
continued
in
force
till
we
find
some
information
in
the
pages
of
fiducin
thus
in
an
inquiry
proved
that
the
inmates
of
brothels
and
also
the
secret
prostitutes
were
mostly
the
children
of
soldiers
who
had
been
brought
to
vice
as
a
trade
either
from
the
want
of
a
proper
bringing
up
or
of
a
skillful
measures
for
the
extermination
of
the
evil
having
been
found
they
were
obliged
to
adopt
the
system
of
a
larger
toleration
of
common
brothels
to
be
strictly
watched
over
by
the
police
as
a
necessary
outlet
for
the
tendency
to
immorality
the
number
of
houses
of
ill
fame
increased
in
proportion
to
the
population
the
influx
of
strangers
and
the
additions
to
the
garrison
made
under
frederick
ii
and
still
more
so
after
the
close
of
the
seven
years
war
in
the
year
there
were
one
hundred
such
houses
in
berlin
each
containing
eight
or
nine
women
they
were
divided
into
three
classes
the
lowest
were
those
in
which
the
women
dressed
in
plain
clothes
and
were
frequented
mostly
by
hamburg
or
amsterdam
mariners
the
second
class
of
women
paraded
themselves
with
painted
faces
haunted
the
more
retired
corners
of
the
town
had
little
attractive
about
their
persons
or
dress
and
were
principally
visited
by
mechanics
and
laborers
the
third
and
apparently
the
most
select
of
the
kind
was
a
description
of
frequented
by
females
who
were
designated
these
did
not
live
in
the
houses
but
used
them
merely
as
a
convenient
rendezvous
in
a
new
code
of
regulations
appeared
the
bulk
of
which
continued
in
force
in
berlin
and
other
towns
for
many
years
the
rules
of
were
too
vague
made
no
provision
for
a
variety
of
cases
likely
to
arise
and
were
silent
as
to
the
question
of
private
prostitution
many
inconveniences
had
arisen
from
these
omissions
and
in
consequence
a
memorial
was
addressed
to
the
government
by
the
police
director
von
eisenhardt
containing
suggestions
for
amendments
to
the
law
the
preamble
of
the
royal
reply
to
this
application
acknowledges
the
attention
of
the
police
to
the
matter
with
much
satisfaction
admits
prostitution
to
be
a
necessary
evil
in
a
great
city
where
many
men
are
not
in
a
position
to
marry
although
of
an
age
when
the
sexual
instincts
are
at
the
highest
in
order
thereby
to
avoid
greater
disorders
which
are
not
to
be
restrained
by
any
law
or
authority
and
which
take
their
rise
from
an
inextinguishable
natural
impulse
but
expressly
reiterates
that
it
is
only
to
be
tolerated
and
that
it
can
not
without
impropriety
and
consequences
injurious
to
morality
be
established
by
the
public
laws
which
do
not
contain
any
sanction
whatever
to
common
prostitution
the
sections
following
this
preamble
provide
that
any
one
who
seduces
a
woman
or
induces
her
to
carry
on
a
venal
traffic
with
her
person
shall
be
liable
to
one
year
imprisonment
in
the
house
of
correction
and
on
repetition
of
the
offense
besides
doubling
the
punishment
shall
be
whipped
and
driven
from
the
country
declare
any
man
or
woman
who
communicates
the
venereal
disease
liable
for
the
expenses
of
the
cure
and
incidental
damages
together
with
imprisonment
for
three
months
commutable
by
paying
a
fine
of
one
hundred
dollars
prohibit
taking
young
women
from
the
country
into
houses
of
prostitution
by
any
device
against
their
will
and
authorize
the
punishment
of
any
man
who
willfully
infects
a
common
woman
in
reference
to
the
special
directions
touching
brothels
and
prostitutes
the
document
provides
as
a
leading
point
that
every
thing
which
exceeds
the
mere
gratification
of
the
natural
passions
and
tends
to
the
advancement
of
debauchery
or
the
misuse
of
our
toleration
of
a
necessary
evil
must
be
prevented
and
accordingly
the
women
are
prohibited
from
increasing
their
attractions
by
painting
or
distinguishing
attire
and
also
from
soliciting
passengers
in
the
public
streets
or
at
the
doors
or
windows
of
their
houses
as
this
is
not
only
in
contravention
to
public
morals
but
especially
perilous
to
male
youth
and
such
means
of
increasing
the
gains
of
people
seeking
their
livelihood
in
this
manner
is
not
to
be
tolerated
for
similar
reasons
the
keepers
of
houses
were
restrained
from
offering
wines
or
other
strong
drinks
to
their
visitors
although
it
is
admitted
they
can
not
be
prevented
from
providing
refreshments
yet
stimulants
are
forbidden
because
they
are
great
inducements
to
debauchery
whereby
other
excesses
may
be
caused
the
orders
farther
provide
that
no
woman
shall
become
a
resident
in
a
house
of
prostitution
without
previously
appearing
before
the
police
and
obtaining
permission
from
them
and
the
police
are
directed
not
to
allow
this
permission
to
any
female
under
age
unless
they
are
satisfied
that
she
has
previously
made
a
trade
of
prostitution
the
section
containing
this
stipulation
is
prefaced
by
a
statement
that
keepers
of
these
houses
seek
especially
to
obtain
blooming
young
girls
who
can
not
be
procured
without
infamous
seduction
calculated
to
lead
to
debauchery
in
reference
to
precautions
against
infection
it
provides
that
the
prostitutes
and
keepers
of
houses
shall
be
instructed
by
some
competent
surgeon
in
the
signs
of
venereal
diseases
so
that
they
may
detect
it
in
their
visitors
or
themselves
also
that
any
man
communicating
infection
to
a
prostitute
may
be
sentenced
to
make
ample
compensation
if
the
woman
can
identify
him
and
farther
that
the
punishment
inflicted
upon
girls
infecting
their
visitors
shall
also
be
inflicted
on
the
housekeepers
as
although
they
may
be
innocent
their
being
included
in
the
punishment
for
an
incident
of
their
trade
is
for
the
general
weal
all
fines
received
were
to
accrue
to
the
medical
institutions
provided
for
the
cure
of
syphilis
again
it
was
deemed
that
the
venereal
disease
was
much
extended
by
common
and
no
women
but
such
as
resided
in
the
known
houses
where
medical
visits
of
inspection
were
constantly
paid
were
to
be
tolerated
and
the
were
instructed
to
arrest
those
common
women
who
were
in
the
habit
of
plying
their
trade
in
the
streets
after
dark
a
portion
of
the
penalty
exacted
being
awarded
to
the
officers
who
made
such
arrests
to
encourage
their
zeal
but
they
were
strictly
cautioned
against
annoying
innocent
persons
inasmuch
as
blunders
in
such
matters
create
ill
impressions
against
the
authorities
and
because
the
honor
and
happiness
of
the
person
might
be
irretrievably
injured
so
that
it
would
be
better
to
pass
over
a
guilty
person
here
and
there
than
to
inculpate
a
single
innocent
one
the
royal
rescript
concludes
by
directing
that
a
strict
be
kept
over
the
females
of
the
garrison
many
of
whom
are
stated
in
very
plain
language
to
be
of
improper
character
these
directions
were
subsequently
embodied
in
the
general
statute
or
law
of
the
land
and
upon
that
the
police
regulations
which
we
quote
hereafter
were
based
the
statute
formally
declares
procurers
and
procuresses
liable
to
imprisonment
for
from
six
months
to
three
years
in
the
house
of
correction
with
a
welcome
and
farewell
a
sound
whipping
when
admitted
and
another
when
discharged
in
the
cases
of
parents
or
guardians
who
may
aid
in
or
connive
at
the
prostitution
of
their
children
or
wards
the
term
of
imprisonment
is
doubled
and
made
more
severe
it
requires
all
common
women
to
reside
in
the
tolerated
houses
under
the
eye
of
the
state
which
houses
are
only
to
be
permitted
in
populous
cities
and
not
elsewhere
than
in
retired
and
back
streets
therein
the
consent
of
the
police
authorities
having
been
first
obtained
and
in
any
case
where
a
house
of
prostitution
was
established
without
this
consent
or
in
defiance
of
the
public
orders
the
keeper
was
to
be
liable
to
one
or
two
years
imprisonment
the
police
are
strictly
commanded
to
keep
all
tolerated
houses
under
strict
and
constant
to
make
frequent
visits
in
company
with
medical
men
so
as
to
check
the
progress
of
venereal
disease
to
prevent
the
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors
therein
to
see
that
no
woman
was
introduced
without
the
knowledge
and
permission
of
the
authorities
under
a
fine
of
fifty
thalers
for
each
offense
and
more
especially
that
no
innocent
female
was
by
force
or
deceit
compelled
or
induced
to
live
therein
which
latter
offense
imposes
a
public
exhibition
in
the
stocks
or
pillory
we
presume
and
from
six
to
ten
years
imprisonment
with
welcome
and
farewell
on
the
keeper
who
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
keep
such
a
house
again
under
any
circumstances
the
police
are
farther
enjoined
to
see
that
the
mistress
of
the
house
informs
the
authorities
of
the
pregnancy
of
any
woman
residing
in
the
house
as
soon
as
she
is
aware
of
it
herself
but
if
it
is
concealed
she
the
mistress
is
liable
to
imprisonment
especially
if
a
secret
birth
takes
place
the
mistress
is
required
to
take
charge
of
any
woman
who
becomes
pregnant
if
there
is
no
public
institution
to
which
she
can
be
removed
and
is
at
liberty
to
seek
compensation
from
the
father
of
the
child
or
if
he
can
not
be
found
she
has
a
claim
upon
the
mother
the
child
must
be
removed
from
the
house
as
soon
as
it
is
weaned
and
is
to
be
cared
for
at
the
public
cost
if
the
parents
have
not
means
to
do
so
if
the
keeper
of
the
house
or
the
inmates
themselves
conceal
any
venereal
infection
from
the
knowledge
of
the
police
they
render
themselves
liable
to
imprisonment
from
three
months
to
a
year
with
welcome
and
farewell
if
thefts
assaults
or
other
offenses
occur
in
such
houses
the
keeper
is
in
all
cases
liable
to
the
injured
party
who
can
not
in
any
other
way
obtain
his
indemnity
and
is
also
suspected
of
complicity
in
the
offense
so
long
as
the
contrary
can
not
be
substantiated
and
if
it
is
proved
that
he
did
not
exert
all
his
power
to
prevent
such
occurrences
his
neglect
is
to
be
punished
by
fine
or
imprisonment
no
woman
desirous
of
leaving
a
tolerated
house
to
change
her
mode
of
life
and
support
herself
honestly
can
be
retained
against
her
inclination
and
no
difficulties
may
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
her
doing
so
nor
will
the
master
be
allowed
to
force
her
to
remain
even
though
she
may
be
in
his
debt
under
the
penalty
of
the
loss
of
his
permission
from
the
police
prostitutes
who
do
not
conform
to
the
regulations
and
place
themselves
under
supervision
are
to
be
arrested
and
imprisoned
for
three
months
and
when
their
term
of
imprisonment
has
expired
are
to
be
sent
to
the
and
detained
there
until
they
have
inclination
and
opportunity
for
honorable
employment
any
females
not
being
inmates
of
the
tolerated
houses
who
had
intercourse
while
suffering
from
disease
and
thereby
infected
men
are
declared
liable
to
an
imprisonment
for
three
months
this
comprehensive
legal
enactment
left
many
matters
of
detail
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
and
accordingly
they
issued
their
rules
the
opposition
these
subsequently
encountered
makes
them
important
in
the
history
of
prostitution
in
berlin
and
although
they
are
in
many
points
a
mere
repetition
of
the
terms
of
the
statute
we
give
them
they
are
entitled
provisions
against
the
misleading
of
young
women
into
brothels
and
for
prevention
of
the
spread
of
venereal
disease
it
has
been
brought
to
notice
that
simple
young
girls
especially
from
the
smaller
towns
under
the
craftiest
pretensions
to
place
them
in
good
situations
have
been
brought
to
berlin
and
without
their
knowledge
of
the
fact
taken
to
brothels
and
therein
against
their
will
led
astray
to
their
ruin
and
to
the
life
of
a
common
prostitute
at
the
same
time
it
is
matter
of
remark
that
common
prostitutes
after
they
have
been
diseased
continue
their
practices
as
long
as
the
state
of
their
sickness
permits
and
thereby
farther
infection
is
extraordinarily
increased
and
extended
with
the
express
view
of
meeting
such
infamous
seductions
and
the
highly
injurious
results
of
the
communication
of
venereal
disease
the
following
directions
are
brought
to
the
cognizance
and
perfect
information
of
the
keepers
of
houses
of
prostitution
and
of
the
females
who
make
a
trade
of
their
persons
no
one
can
set
on
foot
a
brothel
or
keep
women
for
the
purposes
of
prostitution
without
having
communicated
previously
with
the
police
directory
on
the
subject
and
obtained
their
permission
in
writing
whoso
acts
contrary
to
this
shall
together
with
absolute
withdrawal
of
his
license
be
liable
to
one
or
two
years
in
the
house
of
correction
every
must
before
taking
a
girl
into
his
service
produce
her
before
the

directory
and
must
not
conclude
any
contract
with
her
until
the
police
director
has
given
him
written
leave
to
do
so
whereupon
forthwith
the
conditions
upon
which
the
keeper
and
said
woman
have
agreed
are
to
be
registered
with
the
police
and
an
abstract
thereof
shall
be
given
to
each
party
for
which
eight
groschen
are
to
be
paid
as
fees
the
to
whom
the
police
director
toleration
is
extended
must
at
his
order
produce
the
common
prostitutes
and
submit
the
same
to
a
similar
license
and
the
conditions
must
be
drawn
up
for
them
in
the
manner
if
a
keeper
omits
the
same
and
is
accused
of
having
any
woman
for
common
use
in
his
house
for
hours
without
such
notice
he
shall
pay
a
fine
of
fifty
thalers
and
upon
the
third
offense
in
addition
to
the
said
fine
his
trade
shall
be
stopped
and
he
shall
not
carry
on
the
same
any
more
further
it
shall
be
no
excuse
that
the
person
in
question
was
not
there
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution
inasmuch
as
he
is
enjoined
to
point
out
every
female
whom
he
receives
into
his
house
without
exception
and
neglect
of
this
shall
be
taken
as
a
proof
of
contravention
under
penalty
of
the
same
punishment
he
must
give
a
similar
notice
if
a
common
woman
comes
to
him
from
another
house
females
under
age
who
have
not
before
the
publication
of
these
ordinances
notoriously
abandoned
themselves
to
common
prostitution
are
not
to
be
received
by
any
and
when
he
produces
such
persons
before
the
police
directory
the
permit
shall
not
be
allowed
if
he
acts
contrary
to
this
prohibition
he
shall
be
punished
with
two
years
labor

former
keeper

after
three
months

given
when
it

the
royal
rescript
the
statute
and
the
police
ordinance
of
are
founded
upon
the
principle
that
prostitution
is
a
necessary
evil
which
if
unregulated
tends
to
demoralize
all
society
and
inflict
physical
suffering
on
its
votaries
but
as
it
can
never
be
suppressed
it
is
tolerated
in
order
that
those
who
practice
it
may
be
brought
under
supervision
and
control
in
furtherance
of
this
idea
another
police
order
was
promulgated
in
prohibiting
music
and
dancing
at
the
tolerated
houses
and
limiting
the
resort
of
prostitutes
to
public
places
of
amusement
the
immediate
effect
of
this
measure
was
to
close
several
served
by
women
at
the
same
time
the
women
were
classified
into
first
second
and
third
classes
and
the
monthly
tax
graduated
to
one
thaler
cents
two
thirds
of
a
thaler
and
one
third
of
a
thaler
which
was
appropriated
to
the
healing
fund
as
directed
by
the
regulations
of
this
impost
was
doubled
at
a
subsequent
period
in
consequence
of
public
calamities
to
enforce
the
police
directions
and
collect
the
tax
a
census
of
the
public
prostitutes
in
berlin
was
taken
in
june
when
they
amounted
to
the
toleration
was
withdrawn
from
some
of
these
for
various
reasons
and
the
numbers
were
in
july
august
september
october
a
period
of
fairs
and
other
assemblages
and
the
average
finally
settled
at
about
in
a
population
of
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretionary
power
vested
in
the
police
of
berlin
as
in
most
other
cities
of
continental
europe
they
found
it
necessary
to
extend
their
toleration
so
as
to
include
in
their
supervision
those
private
prostitutes
who
could
not
be
permitted
to
reside
in
the
tolerated
houses
because
they
had
not
reached
the
age
prescribed
by
law
which
in
prussia
fixes
majority
at
years
and
also
another
class
who
were
secretly
visited
at
private
lodgings
by
those
wealthy
libertines
whose
pride
would
not
allow
them
to
enter
a
common
brothel
and
whose
consequently
exposed
them
to
liabilities
which
the
spirit
of
the
law
justified
the
police
in
encountering
the
persons
mostly
widows
with
whom
the
private
prostitutes
resided
were
made
answerable
to
the
police
and
subjected
to
the
same
rules
as
the
tolerated
houses
under
the
new
scale
of
impost
there
were
in
brothels
of
the
class
with
inmates
private
prostitutes
of
the
class
total
about
this
period
an
epoch
of
general
political
movement
men
of
the
highest
rank
in
prussia
began
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
tolerating
prostitution
and
orders
were
given
in
opposition
to
the
remonstrances
of
the
police
to
take
measures
which
would
effectually
compel
to
close
their
houses
this
appears
to
have
been
the
first
positive
attempt
at
absolute
repression
and
the
police
intimated
that
illicit
prostitution
would
be
its
inevitable
result
in
reply
they
were
directed
that
if
their
prediction
should
be
verified
they
must
pursue
the
vice
more
closely
in
the
number
of
registered
women
had
decreased
to
it
was
notorious
that
illicit
prostitution
had
increased
this
fact
was
not
denied
by
the
police
they
ascribed
it
very
justly
to
the
restrictions
imposed
on
the
tolerated
houses
which
were
now
actually
less
than
ever
at
a
time
when
the
resident
population
of
berlin
was
twenty
thousand
more
than
at
the
last
computation
exclusive
of
a
large
influx
of
troops
and
foreigners
they
were
not
supported
in
their
views
but
were
ordered
on
the
ground
of
extensive
disease
among
the
soldiery
to
crush
out
the
illicit
prostitution
and
this
order
they
vainly
endeavored
to
accomplish
an
inquiry
into
the
comparative
state
of
the
venereal
disease
was
directed
at
the
same
time
and
the
state
physician
reported
that
was
less
disease
among
registered
than
illicit
prostitutes
and
inferred
that
a
diminution
of
tolerated
but
strictly
guarded
regular
brothels
was
not
for
the
public
the
year
when
the
french
army
overran
europe
was
a
period
of
general
war
and
trouble
the
police
regulations
fell
into
abeyance
and
prostitution
became
comparatively
free
and
uncontrolled
the
french
military
commanders
in
berlin
made
complaints
to
the
police
of
the
lawless
state
of
the
town
particularly
specifying
some
of
the
brothels
which
had
become
nests
of
gamblers
wherein
robbery
duels
suicides
and
other
offenses
were
of
frequent
occurrence
the
results
of
an
inspection
were
as
follows
brothels
containing
women
private
prostitutes
in
addition
to
this
there
were
of
notorious
illicit
prostitutes
known
to
the
police
of
whom
were
stated
to
have
disease
in
its
worst
forms
and
also
reasonably
suspected
of
prostitution
making
an
aggregate
known
to
the
authorities
of
there
were
also
seventy
which
were
known
as
places
of
accommodation
the
population
at
this
time
was
about
the
figures
thus
given
from
an
official
enumeration
are
the
best
practical
commentary
upon
the
effects
of
the
abandonment
of
a
tried
system
of
the
state
of
affairs
disclosed
by
this
inquiry
called
forth
a
ministerial
rescript
dated
may
which
we
copy
the
are
by
reason
of
the
great
influence
they
have
on
morality
and
health
a
very
important
branch
of
police
administration
should
desire
to
be
satisfied
whether
it
is
more
desirable
to
suppress
or
tolerate
in
any
case
it
is
however
improper
and
injurious
to
license
them
and
thus
to
give
them
a
certain
sanction
still
less
can
they
be
tolerated
in
public
neighborhoods
of
a
city
it
is
rather
to
be
desired
that
upon
every
convenient
and
properly
occurring
opportunity
they
should
be
stamped
with
the
brand
of
the
deepest
depravity
and
infamy
we
have
therefore
commanded
the
police
directory
to
effect
the
removal
of
all
such
houses
into
quiet
retired
streets
of
the
suburbs
and
liberties
and
we
direct
you
to
take
into
consideration
whether
a
like
regulation
can
not
be
accomplished
here
in
the
city
of
berlin
whereupon
you
will
make
to
us
a
report
you
are
also
to
take
into
consideration
what
can
be
done
to
brand
such
places
with
the
deepest
depravity
and
infamy
in
obedience
to
this
order
which
had
doubtless
emanated
direct
from
royalty
itself
herr
von
gruner
the
head
of
the
berlin
police
communicated
a
report
containing
his
conclusions
as
follows
that
closing
or
even
limiting
the
brothels
would
lead
to
very
general
ill
health
that
in
consequence
of
the
exertions
of
the
police
illicit
prostitution
had
been
diminished
very
much
and
even
the
number
of
the
registered
women
had
decreased
that
in
there
were
in
berlin
first
class
brothel
containing
women
second
third
private
prostitutes
total
registered
that
this
number
might
seem
larger
than
before
but
the
passage
of
troops
and
the
large
garrison
of
berlin
had
led
to
the
increase
and
evidently
a
great
increase
of
secret
prostitution
and
its
results
would
have
been
experienced
in
place
of
the
registered
prostitution
had
not
an
extension
of
this
same
registered
prostitution
been
tolerated
that
particular
streets
in
which
brothels
were
to
be
found
were
certainly
no
longer
suitable
places
on
account
of
the
greater
traffic
which
they
had
gained
and
these
houses
might
on
that
account
be
removed
to
back
streets
including
the
etc
that
he
did
not
know
in
what
manner
brand
of
depravity
and
infamy
could
be
impressed
on
the
trade
of
prostitution
except
by
directing
a
particular
costume
differing
from
the
clothing
of
respectable
women
in
continuation
of
this
report
the
commissary
states
his
opinion
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
public
order
to
keep
the
common
houses
in
narrow
limits
as
it
would
bring
together
all
the
idle
people
which
might
lead
to
a
disturbance
that
a
special
costume
for
the
women
would
be
of
no
use
at
home
and
out
of
doors
it
would
only
give
occasion
for
a
public
scandal
without
effecting
the
purpose
of
their
reform
that
lastly
he
objects
to
the
toleration
of
private
prostitutes
as
there
is
no
good
result
from
their
registration
except
their
health
and
the
general
regulation
in
that
and
other
matters
is
much
better
secured
in
the
brothels
among
the
official
correspondence
on
this
matter
we
find
another
document
worthy
of
notice
it
is
a
report
by
a
to
the
superior
police
authorities
dated
january
there
are
such
houses
of
prostitution
and
compared
with
the
population
of
berlin
that
is
not
many
they
are
divided
into
three
classes
and
together
with
the
prostitutes
living
on
their
own
account
are
controlled
in
conformity
with
the
regulations
of
february
in
compliance
with
such
rules
they
pay
the
taxes
to
the
healing
fund
past
negligent
mismanagement
has
unfortunately
permitted
several
brothels
in
streets
their
removal
to
more
retired
places
i
find
highly
desirable
it
is
urgent
that
no
more
private
women
of
the
town
should
be
tolerated
but
rather
that
they
should
if
they
can
not
return
to
good
conduct
be
sent
into
the
or
where
they
are
not
natives
of
berlin
be
sent
out
of
the
city
forthwith
or
otherwise
be
sent
to
the
house
of
industry
these
women
living
alone
are
very
perilous
to
morality
and
health
inasmuch
as
they
can
not
be
so
perfectly
controlled
as
in
the
brothels
in
modesty
of
deportment
cleanliness
and
retirement
also
because
they
are
able
to
withhold
themselves
from
medical
inspection
and
to
carry
on
their
trade
when
they
know
themselves
to
be
suffering
from
venereal
diseases
the
lists
of
the
prostitutes
under
treatment
at
the
charité
demonstrate
this
the
opinion
that
this
living
alone
favors
a
return
to
virtue
is
not
supported
by
experience
were
it
even
so
the
disadvantages
enumerated
are
more
important
than
so
rare
and
problematical
a
benefit
the
question
the
toleration
of
brothels
in
large
cities
and
their
regulation
by
the
police
so
that
infected
females
should
not
be
permitted
therein
is
advisable
in
order
to
counteract
the
seduction
of
respectable
females
can
not
be
categorically
answered
in
the
affirmative
still
in
berlin
it
seems
that
brothels
if
not
a
necessary
evil
can
not
be
momentarily
abolished
but
such
steps
must
be
devised
as
will
gradually
remove
the
evil
and
make
the
disgrace
generally
noticeable
to
this
end
the
above
propositions
touching
private
prostitutes
and
removal
of
brothels
from
public
streets
will
be
carried
into
effect
express
limitations
of
the
brothels
to
two
or
three
streets
would
give
occasion
to
gatherings
on
holidays
that
might
lead
to
riots
and
other
excesses
a
special
external
designation
of
prostitutes
would
only
lead
to
uproar
without
causing
the
women
to
feel
the
odium
of
their
calling
more
than
at
present
the
remainder
of
this
report
is
unimportant
in
october
a
public
order
was
made
for
effectuating
its
recommendations
after
this
event
the
king
became
impressed
with
an
idea
of
the
impolicy
and
impropriety
of
the
toleration
system
and
a
lengthy
correspondence
ensued
between
the
various
departments
and
state
officials
on
the
subject
the
royal
rescripts
enunciating
the
opinions
on
the
subject
in
general
objecting
to
the
details
of
the
police
management
or
directing
reports
on
some
particular
incident
of
the
system
the
police
authorities
fortified
by
experience
as
opposed
to
theory
adhering
to
the
toleration
practice
and
demanding
increased
powers
to
restrain
private
prostitution
and
compel
all
such
persons
to
enter
the
public
houses
the
matter
was
brought
to
a
close
in
by
an
order
from
the
crown
for
a
total
closing
of
the
tolerated
brothels
the
police
president
lecoq
thought
it
advisable
to
communicate
with
the
authorities
of
the
town
of
breslau
before
he
complied
with
this
order
requesting
some
information
as
to
the
state
of
public
morals
there
it
being
stated
that
there
was
not
a
single
brothel
or
registered
prostitute
to
be
found
within
its
limits
the
reply
from
the
breslau
officials
was
in
the
affirmative
as
to
the
fact
as
to
the
results
they
had
consulted
with
the
state
physician
and
the
hospital
physician
and
their
opinion
was
that
closing
the
brothels
and
withdrawal
of
toleration
not
been
as
in
spite
of
the
police
vigilance
illicit
prostitution
had
increased
since
and
procuresses
carried
on
their
arts
more
extensively
their
operations
being
altogether
secret
and
under
no
police
control
the
venereal
disease
had
not
nothing
counteracted
it
so
effectually
as
the
medical
inspection
of
known
that
its
secret
spread
had
been
so
great
as
to
extend
its
ravages
through
the
instrumentality
of
female
servants
into
respectable
that
the
hospital
returns
proved
but
little
because
the
cases
were
suffered
to
run
on
or
were
privately
cured
but
these
returns
were
given
as
follows
venereal
cases
in
illegitimate
births
years
breslau
hospital
in
breslau
the
years
and
were
those
of
the
french
invasion
in
the
brothels
in
breslau
were
closed
the
general
peace
of
diverted
the
energies
of
crowned
heads
and
leading
statesmen
from
matters
of
internal
policy
and
the
police
of
berlin
were
left
at
liberty
to
pursue
their
old
plans
then
the
inhabitants
began
to
object
to
brothels
and
to
petition
against
those
in
their
immediate
neighborhood
this
drew
from
the
police
an
argumentative
document
in
which
they
fully
reviewed
the
question
but
refused
the
prayer
of
the
petition
the
change
of
localities
alterations
in
the
law
and
other
circumstances
made
a
of
the
code
of
desirable
and
this
took
place
in
the
alterations
are
chiefly
in
minor
details
of
no
general
interest
but
the
law
against
frequenting
places
of
public
amusement
was
made
part
of
this
police
order
which
declared
that
the
presence
of
prostitutes
at
houses
of
public
entertainment
was
strictly
forbidden
the
most
material
change
consisted
in
some
very
minute
directions
for
guarding
against
venereal
disease
to
this
end
every
was
required
to
furnish
each
woman
in
his
house
with
a
proper
syringe
which
she
was
directed
to
use
frequently
under
the
orders
of
the
medical
visitors
the
private
prostitutes
were
directed
to
observe
similar
precautions
and
in
place
of
a
fixed
weekly
inspection
by
a
medical
officer
he
was
ordered
to
make
his
visits
at
uncertain
intervals
at
this
time
there
were
brothels
in
berlin
some
of
the
citizens
renewed
their
petitions
for
a
removal
of
a
portion
of
them
but
with
no
better
success
than
before
in
the
morality
of
the
system
of
toleration
was
again
questioned
by
those
in
authority
and
the
minister
of
the
interior
in
a
rescript
to
the
authorities
of
the
rhine
provinces
alluded
to
the
matter
of
prostitution
and
expressed
himself
as
strongly
opposed
to
any
system
of
toleration
we
quote
a
portion
of
his
remarks
as
for
the
granting
of
licenses
to
brothels
i
can
not
accede
to
it
inasmuch
as
the
advantages
to
be
gained
are
in
my
opinion
illusory
and
in
no
degree
countervail
the
inconvenience
of
the
state
sanction
thus
afforded
to
discreditable
institutions
all
attempts
by
the
police
to
introduce
decency
and
propriety
by
means
of
brothel
regulations
are
idle
brothels
are
not
an
invention
of
necessity
but
are
simply
an
offshoot
of
immoral
no
one
has
a
right
to
expect
himself
to
be
protected
from
injury
and
disease
while
seeking
the
gratification
of
unreasonable
sexual
enjoyments
the
opinion
that
brothels
are
outlets
for
dangerous
arts
of
seduction
has
never
been
substantiated
had
the
police
ever
realized
the
suppression
of
illicit
prostitution
by
means
of
tolerated
brothels
then
indeed
a
decided
opinion
might
be
formed
as
to
the
utility
in
a
sanitary
point
of
view
of
brothels
opinions
of
this
nature
from
such
a
quarter
notwithstanding
their
absurdity
in
many
respects
could
not
be
without
their
effect
and
induced
the
citizens
to
renew
their
petitions
for
the
suppression
or
removal
of
some
of
the
tolerated
houses
of
prostitution
in
a
ministerial
order
enjoined
such
removal
it
was
promptly
obeyed
some
brothels
were
at
once
suppressed
and
others
were
removed
and
concentrated
in
a
notorious
spot
called
the
königsmauer
the
relative
number
of
brothels
and
prostitutes
in
the
years
and
was
as
follows
brothels
prostitutes
of
brothels
in
of
prostitutes
in
forty
more
women
crowded
into
a
less
number
of
houses
an
average
of
ten
prostitutes
to
each
brothel
instead
of
six
as
before
is
but
a
poor
commentary
on
enforced
suppression
the
known
inclination
of
the
highest
persons
in
the
kingdom
to
put
down
brothels
speedily
induced
a
renewal
of
the
agitation
against
them
so
far
as
locality
was
in
question
it
was
admitted
that
no
more
suitable
place
could
have
been
found
the
königsmauer
was
a
spot
shunned
by
decent
people
from
old
times
out
of
the
way
and
with
few
inhabitants
but
those
interested
in
the
traffic
there
was
nobody
to
suffer
and
the
whole
argument
virtually
turned
upon
the
moral
consequences
of
the
government
regulations
and
their
utility
to
the
public
among
the
petitions
of
one
had
been
presented
from
a
number
of
berlin
citizens
to
prince
william
the
uncle
of
the
king
stating
that
these
brothels
were
an
abomination
that
many
of
them
were
splendidly
fitted
up
in
which
all
means
of
excitement
were
used
that
the
women
appeared
at
the
windows
exposed
and
in
short
the
memorialists
said
all
that
is
customarily
said
on
such
occasions
but
they
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
the
police
possessed
both
power
and
inclination
to
suppress
such
grievances
or
else
it
never
occurred
to
these
berlin
citizens
that
their
assistance
given
to
the
police
would
have
speedily
checked
the
evils
the
memorial
was
handed
to
the
king
himself
and
he
required
a
report
upon
the
matter
from
the
director
of
police
this
was
duly
furnished
and
represented
that
the
corruption
of
manners
in
berlin
and
in
the
parts
of
berlin
complained
of
was
not
more
extreme
than
in
other
great
cities
of
germany
and
in
like
places
that
in
the
limitation
of
the
ineradicable
vice
of
prostitution
by
her
police
regulations
berlin
had
greatly
the
advantage
of
vienna
for
in
berlin
including
the
garrison
had
a
population
of
souls
among
whom
there
was
of
course
a
very
large
number
of
unmarried
men
that
the
syphilitic
cases
in
the
charité
had
been
in
men
women
total
assuming
that
one
third
of
the
venereal
cases
in
berlin
were
treated
privately
this
gives
an
average
of
in
or
in
every
four
hundred
and
fifty
men
there
is
one
syphilitic
subject
whereas
calculation
for
vienna
is
in
every
the
same
report
continues
every
official
will
bear
out
my
assertion
that
the
number
of
brothels
is
in
inverse
proportion
to
illicit
prostitution
that
is
the
fewer
of
the
former
the
more
of
the
latter
and
the
greater
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
them
and
preventing
syphilis
in
another
memorial
was
presented
with
further
complaints
against
the
same
houses
in
the
königsmauer
this
was
referred
to
the
police
authorities
with
the
brief
injunction
make
an
end
of
the
nuisances
about
which
there
are
so
many
complaints
the
of
the
province
of
brandenburg
now
joined
their
influence
to
swell
the
public
outcry
that
the
few
houses
of
prostitution
on
the
königsmauer
were
hurtful
to
public
morals
and
a
bad
example
to
youth
and
on
the
ground
of
interest
in
their
students
and
pupils
demanded
that
they
be
closed
the
police
who
had
previously
taken
every
precaution
against
a
violation
of
public
decency
now
deputed
a
special
inspector
to
give
his
personal
attention
to
the
locality
he
reported
there
was
no
valid
ground
of
complaint
as
to
the
outward
conduct
of
the
inhabitants
or
the
internal
management
of
the
houses
thus
satisfied
as
to
the
nature
of
the
opposition
the
police
treated
the
college
officials
somewhat
cavalierly
and
recommended
them
to
prohibit
their
students
visiting
such
an
place
a
very
sensible
piece
of
advice
and
the
best
that
could
have
been
given
under
the
circumstances
according
to
behrend
who
has
written
on
prostitution
in
berlin
the
leading
spirits
of
this
agitation
were
a
clergyman
and
a
distiller
who
had
a
brewery
and
in
the
vicinity
of
the
königsmauer
the
clergyman
proceeded
upon
moral
and
religious
grounds
and
led
the
crusade
against
brothels
as
a
public
disgrace
unworthy
a
christian
nation
we
do
not
learn
what
line
of
argument
the
distiller
adopted
or
whether
the
prohibition
of
liquor
in
houses
of
prostitution
influenced
his
zeal
these
agitators
applied
to
the
police
with
a
succession
of
general
complaints
as
to
the
luxury
of
the
houses
the
gains
of
the
women
the
bad
example
to
the
young
and
other
topics
of
a
similar
nature
they
met
with
but
scant
favor
however
they
were
assured
that
every
possible
means
should
be
used
to
keep
the
offenders
within
the
bounds
of
existing
rules
the
memorialists
then
carried
their
grievances
to
various
influential
people
and
at
length
to
count
arnim
the
minister
of
the
interior
to
whom
a
petition
was
presented
praying
the
entire
suppression
of
all
tolerated
brothels
this
petition
contained
all
the
allegations
and
arguments
which
could
possibly
be
advanced
against
the
places
in
question
augmented
by
much
rhetorical
flourish
about
the
degradation
of
royal
officers
the
desecration
of
the
baptismal
register
produced
by
prostitutes
at
the
time
of
inscription
the
insult
to
majesty
in
allowing
brothels
to
exist
in
a
street
called
königsmauer
and
many
similarly
weighty
points
the
practical
knowledge
of
the
police
as
to
the
effect
of
registration
in
checking
more
baneful
excesses
was
theoretically
disputed
the
propositions
on
which
the
toleration
system
was
based
were
denied
the
defense
of
the
plan
by
those
cognizant
of
its
working
was
entirely
ruled
out
so
that
to
a
person
unacquainted
with
both
sides
of
the
question
a
sufficient
case
was
presented
the
ministerial
reply
was
favorable
but
not
conclusive
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
number
of
brothels
is
to
be
reduced
one
half
which
are
to
be
removed
beyond
the
city
walls
to
the
most
retired
position
possible
where
annoyance
to
the
neighbors
is
not
to
be
feared
for
the
control
of
those
remaining
patrols
of
gens
are
to
be
kept
afoot
and
relieved
six
times
a
day
every
third
breach
of
the
regulations
whether
in
small
or
great
matters
will
be
followed
by
the
closing
of
the
house
should
these
orders
not
be
sufficient
the
police
are
empowered
to
close
all
the
houses
for
it
must
be
understood
that
brothels
are
not
licensed
but
only
tolerated
as
necessity
requires
and
care
for
public
decency
permits
the
police
authorities
foresaw
difficulties
in
the
details
of
these
proceedings
and
asked
for
more
explicit
instructions
which
were
supplied
in
the
second
communication
was
this
remarkable
passage
should
a
diminution
in
the
number
of
brothels
take
place
and
thereby
the
number
of
common
prostitutes
be
affected
we
shall
then
learn
by
experience
whether
consequences
injurious
to
public
morality
and
order
ensue
and
the
decision
of
the
main
question
can
then
be
made
with
certainty
whether
we
can
not
advance
to
the
entire
abolition
of
brothels
in
following
the
prescribed
course
and
overthrowing
an
established
system
in
order
to
furnish
ministerial
experience
of
the
trouble
it
would
cause
the
police
instituted
a
series
of
inquiries
and
embodied
the
result
in
a
report
to
the
minister
of
the
interior
dated
july
which
shows
that
there
were
brothels
containing
women
registered
private
prostitutes
total
the
amount
received
and
disbursed
on
account
of
the
healing
fund
was
also
reported
in
thalers
thus
received
disbursed
it
concludes
with
the
opinion
entertained
by
the
police
as
for
the
influence
which
the
extinction
of
brothels
may
have
upon
the
morals
safety
and
health
of
society
the
police
authorities
think
themselves
obliged
as
before
to
declare
against
the
expediency
of
the
proceeding
what
should
be
done
in
case
this
course
should
be
adopted
is
a
question
that
requires
much
consideration
meanwhile
the
police
are
of
opinion
it
would
be
highly
objectionable
to
close
the
brothels
before
other
measures
are
prepared
in
reference
to
prostitution
no
such
measures
were
prepared
the
king
would
hear
no
farther
argument
upon
the
matter
and
by
positive
royal
command
the
brothels
were
closed
and
registered
prostitution
stopped
december
berlin
became
nominally
as
virtuous
as
an
edict
from
the
throne
could
make
it
the
majority
of
the
prostitutes
were
either
sent
to
their
former
homes
or
supplied
with
passports
for
places
out
of
the
kingdom
a
few
were
left
houseless
friendless
and
destitute
history
does
not
say
whether
the
friends
of
enforced
continence
provided
for
these
sufferers
this
summary
edict
seriously
embarrassed
the
police
especially
as
the
state
laws
tolerating
prostitution
were
unrepealed
they
applied
to
the
authorities
of
halle
and
cologne
where
a
similar
measure
had
been
enforced
and
the
substance
of
the
replies
received
was
as
follows
from
halle
since
the
french
occupation
the
brothels
had
been
put
down
there
had
been
a
few
persons
charged
with
prostitution
whom
the
police
caught
and
and
sent
to
jail
where
they
were
cured
there
were
however
very
few
vicious
persons
in
halle
and
there
had
been
no
need
of
special
provision
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
honest
livelihood
for
the
common
women
as
to
syphilis
there
had
been
no
increase
of
cases
since
the
last
of
the
brothels
the
authorities
of
cologne
had
no
such
pleasing
tale
to
tell
they
say
at
the
end
of
the
french
occupation
the
authorities
had
put
down
all
the
licensed
brothels
and
at
the
same
time
made
vigilant
search
for
private
prostitutes
legal
difficulties
had
for
many
years
been
in
the
way
as
the
laws
made
no
provision
against
private
prostitution
when
not
carried
on
as
a
trade
for
gain
and
the
technical
proof
was
difficult
against
procurers
and
procuresses
the
law
was
ineffective
except
in
cases
where
the
seduced
female
was
under
age
when
the
amendments
in
the
law
had
taken
place
the
police
had
worked
vigorously
and
in
the
years
and
a
time
when
illicit
prostitution
had
enormously
increased
they
had
presented
three
hundred
cases
of
that
offense
regarded
syphilis
the
city
physician
was
of
opinion
that
in
late
years
the
disease
had
increased
among
all
classes
and
had
appeared
in
a
much
worse
in
consequence
however
of
the
increased
energy
of
the
police
affairs
had
become
under
better
control
and
the
number
of
private
brothels
had
materially
diminished
so
that
there
are
now
but
about
fifteen
in
the
city
the
secret
prostitution
was
not
however
under
any
control
the
police
found
it
impracticable
to
keep
vicious
persons
in
check
who
in
default
of
other
accommodation
committed
the
most
depraved
acts
in
stray
vehicles
or
any
suitable
the
writer
of
this
official
communication
added
his
private
opinion
based
upon
the
experience
of
some
years
that
no
effective
steps
could
be
devised
to
suppress
prostitution
all
that
could
be
done
would
be
to
palliate
it
and
keep
it
under
these
statements
were
not
calculated
to
relieve
the
anxiety
of
the
berlin
officials
who
were
pressed
by
the
ministers
to
devise
plans
for
executing
the
royal
orders
they
accordingly
met
in
much
embarrassment
and
prepared
a
scheme
which
was
not
acceptable
to
the
superior
powers
it
was
ordered
eventually
that
the
women
suspected
of
prostitution
being
about
or
in
berlin
should
be
warned
by
the
police
to
discontinue
their
practices
if
found
out
they
were
to
be
punished
and
after
punishment
to
be
continued
under
until
good
behavior
during
such
period
they
were
to
be
periodically
examined
for
disease
at
the
police
office
by
medical
men
the
punishment
to
be
made
more
severe
on
the
repetition
of
the
offense
these
orders
following
immediately
the
suppression
mandate
will
strike
every
one
as
reaffirming
the
principles
of
the
toleration
system
in
the
most
important
particular
the
regard
for
public
health
the
police
used
all
their
energy
to
enforce
them
but
at
the
same
time
represented
their
fears
of
the
consequences
namely
the
spread
of
prostitution
the
increase
of
disease
and
a
general
licentiousness
of
habits
it
now
remains
to
trace
the
effects
of
the
suppression
of
registered
brothels
and
local
authorities
afford
abundant
and
satisfactory
proof
that
the
fears
of
the
police
were
realized
the
july
says
well
meant
but
altogether
erroneous
is
the
proposition
that
brothels
can
be
dispensed
with
in
times
of
general
intelligence
and
education
and
that
now
this
relic
of
barbarism
can
be
done
away
with
already
only
two
years
after
the
closing
of
the
brothels
this
deception
has
been
exploded
and
we
have
bought
experience
at
the
public
cost
the
illicit
prostitutes
who
well
know
how
to
escape
the
hands
of
the
police
have
spread
their
nets
of
demoralization
over
the
whole
city
and
against
them
the
old
prostitution
houses
which
were
under
a
purifying
police
control
in
sanitary
and
general
matters
afforded
safety
and
protection
in
another
local
paper
we
find
prostitution
which
had
previously
kept
out
of
sight
in
dark
and
retired
corners
now
came
forward
boldly
and
openly
for
it
found
protection
and
countenance
in
the
large
number
of
its
supporters
and
no
police
care
could
restrain
it
the
prostitutes
did
not
merely
traverse
the
streets
and
frequent
the
public
thoroughfares
to
hunt
their
prey
thereby
insulting
virtuous
women
and
putting
them
to
the
blush
they
crowded
the
fashionable
promenades
the
concerts
the
theatres
and
other
places
of
amusement
where
they
claimed
the
foremost
places
and
set
the
fashion
of
the
hour
they
were
conspicuous
for
their
brilliant
toilettes
and
their
example
was
captivating
and
pernicious
to
the
youth
of
both
sexes
from
a
work
called
berlin
by
sass
we
obtain
the
annexed
view
of
public
life
in
berlin
no
city
in
germany
can
boast
of
the
splendid
of
berlin
one
in
particular
near
the
brandenburg
gate
and
the
is
remarkable
for
its
size
and
presents
a
magnificent
exterior
especially
in
the
evening
when
hundreds
of
lamps
stream
through
the
windows
and
light
up
the
park
in
front
the
interior
is
of
corresponding
splendor
and
when
the
vast
hall
resounds
with
the
music
of
the
grand
orchestra
and
is
filled
with
a
gay
crowd
rustling
in
silks
or
satins
or
lounging
in
the
hall
or
whirling
in
the
giddy
waltz
it
is
certainly
a
scene
to
intoxicate
the
youth
who
frequent
it
in
search
of
adventure
or
to
drink
in
the
poison
of
seductive
and
deceiving
although
bright
and
fascinating
eyes
should
the
foreigner
visit
this
scene
on
one
of
its
gay
nights
he
may
get
a
glimpse
of
the
depths
of
berlin
life
many
a
veil
is
lifted
here
this
splendid
scene
has
its
dark
side
this
is
not
respectable
berlin
this
whirling
laughing
crowd
is
frivolous
berlin
whether
of
wealth
extravagance
and
folly
or
of
poverty
vice
and
necessity
the
prostitute
and
the
swindler
are
on
every
side
formerly
the
female
visitors
were
of
good
repute
but
gradually
courtesans
and
women
of
light
character
slipped
in
until
at
length
no
lady
could
be
seen
there
and
the
aforesaid
foreigner
who
lounges
through
the
rooms
admiring
the
elegant
and
lovely
women
who
surround
him
in
charge
of
some
highly
respectable
elderly
person
an
or
a
or
possibly
in
company
with
her
husband
seeks
to
know
the
names
and
position
of
such
evident
celebrity
and
fashion
not
you
know
her
any
police
officer
can
tell
you
her
history
are
the
replies
he
receives
there
is
a
class
of
men
at
this
place
who
perform
a
function
singular
to
the
uninitiated
these
worthies
are
the
of
the
ladies
they
play
the
careless
or
the
strict
cavalier
are
on
occasion
appear
or
keep
out
of
sight
according
to
the
proprieties
of
the
moment
from
the
same
writer
we
extract
the
following
sketch
of
a
dancing
saloon
the
price
of
admission
is
ten
groschen
about
twenty
cents
which
insures
a
company
who
can
pay
the
male
public
are
of
all
conditions
and
include
students
clerks
and
artists
with
of
course
a
fair
share
of
rogues
and
pickpockets
the
majority
of
the
women
are
prostitutes
there
may
be
found
girls
of
rare
beauty
steeped
to
the
lips
in
all
the
arts
of
iniquity
the
philosopher
may
see
life
essentially
in
the
same
grade
as
in
the
last
description
but
in
a
somewhat
less
artificial
condition
scenes
of
bacchant
excitement
and
of
wildest
abandonment
may
be
witnessed
here
the
outward
show
is
all
mirth
and
happiness
pleasure
unrestrained
seems
the
business
of
the
place
turn
the
picture
the
most
showy
of
the
costumes
are
hired
the
gayety
is
for
a
living
the
liberty
is
licentiousness
these
creatures
who
all
blithesome
as
they
seem
the
victims
of
others
who
fleece
them
of
every
thing
they
can
earn
are
now
engaged
in
securing
victims
from
whom
they
may
wring
the
gains
which
are
to
pay
the
hire
of
their
elegant
dresses
or
furnish
means
for
further
excesses
or
perhaps
to
pay
for
their
supper
that
evening
it
is
the
fashion
of
the
place
for
each
to
invite
a
to
supper
where
the
quantity
of
wine
drunk
is
incredible
how
many
a
young
man
has
to
trace
not
merely
loss
of
cash
and
health
to
such
a
place
but
also
loss
of
honor
the
who
have
no
such
agreeable
partners
sit
apart
sullen
and
discontented
oftentimes
they
have
no
money
to
pay
for
their
own
refreshments
pair
by
pair
the
crowd
diminishes
until
toward
three
or
four
when
the
place
is
closed
the
lowest
are
the
inferior
to
the
saloons
where
again
quoting
the
dance
is
carried
to
its
wildest
excess
to
music
in
a
pestilential
atmosphere
the
poor
are
extravagant
drunkenness
and
profligacy
abound
servants
of
both
sexes
soldiers
and
journeymen
workwomen
and
prostitutes
make
up
the
public
here
on
the
most
frivolous
pretenses
concubinage
and
marriage
are
arranged
and
from
this
scene
of
folly
and
vice
the
family
is
ushered
to
the
world
the
is
met
here
the
type
of
country
simplicity
who
after
a
night
of
tumult
and
uproar
with
her
lover
will
go
in
the
morning
to
nurse
the
child
whose
mother
neglects
her
parental
duties
at
the
dictates
of
fashion
the
working
classes
have
their
representatives
who
drown
their
cares
in
drink
while
boys
and
girls
make
up
the
motley
party
in
these
assemblies
there
is
a
difference
some
are
attended
by
citizens
of
the
humbler
classes
by
working
men
and
women
others
by
criminals
and
their
paramours
in
these
latter
resorts
the
excesses
are
of
a
more
frightful
character
than
in
those
where
a
show
of
decency
restrains
the
grosser
exhibitions
youth
of
both
sexes
are
among
the
criminals
who
are
habituated
to
smoking
drinking
and
the
wildest
orgies
long
before
their
frames
have
attained
a
proper
development
physiognomies
which
might
have
sprung
from
the
most
hideous
fancy
of
poet
or
painter
may
be
met
with
in
an
anonymous
pamphlet
entitled
prostitution
in
berlin
is
another
hideous
picture
in
the
königstadt
there
is
a
drinking
saloon
where
besides
the
wife
of
the
host
there
are
two
young
girls
who
exceed
all
compeers
in
shamelessness
and
depravity
the
elder
betrays
secondary
syphilis
in
her
voice
the
younger
has
such
noble
features
is
of
such
beauty
and
is
altogether
of
such
prepossessing
appearance
that
the
infamy
of
her
conduct
is
incredible
in
the
evening
these
girls
and
the
host
are
generally
drunk
at
one
or
two
in
the
morning
the
place
is
a
perfect
hell
the
whole
company
guests
host
and
girls
being
mad
with
liquor
some
are
dancing
with
the
girls
to
the
tinkle
of
a
guitar
the
player
of
which
acted
her
part
in
one
of
the
abolished
brothels
others
are
roaring
obscene
songs
if
the
has
brought
her
daughter
then
the
tumult
of
the
den
is
complete
it
is
never
closed
before
four
in
the
morning
when
the
girls
retire
to
their
dwellings
in
company
with
one
or
the
other
of
their
guests
in
reading
these
descriptions
it
must
be
remembered
that
under
the
toleration
system
the
police
would
not
permit
prostitutes
to
visit
places
of
public
amusement
nor
would
they
allow
music
and
dancing
in
the
brothels
another
part
of
sass
work
contains
a
truly
horrid
picture
of
the
immorality
of
the
city
we
transcribe
it
in
conclusion
of
this
branch
of
the
subject
private
life
in
berlin
let
us
enter
the
house
the
first
floor
is
inhabited
by
a
family
of
distinction
husband
and
wife
have
been
separated
for
years
he
lives
on
one
side
she
on
the
other
both
go
out
in
public
together
the
proprieties
are
kept
in
view
but
servants
will
chatter
on
the
second
floor
lives
an
assessor
with
his
kept
woman
when
he
is
out
of
town
as
the
house
is
well
aware
a
doctor
pays
her
a
visit
on
the
other
side
the
staircase
lives
a
carrier
with
his
wife
and
child
the
wife
had
not
mentioned
that
this
child
was
born
before
marriage
he
found
it
out
of
course
they
quarreled
and
he
now
takes
his
revenge
in
drunkenness
blows
and
abuse
we
ascend
to
the
third
floor
on
the
right
of
the
stairs
is
a
teacher
who
has
had
a
child
by
his
sister
the
wife
grieves
sorely
over
the
same
with
him
lodges
a
who
ran
away
from
his
wife
and
three
children
and
now
lives
with
his
concubine
and
one
child
in
a
wretched
little
cupboard
on
the
left
is
a
family
his
pay
is
fifteen
thalers
twelve
dollars
a
month
but
the
people
seem
very
comfortable
their
daughter
has
a
very
nice
front
room
well
furnished
and
is
kept
by
a
very
wealthy
merchant
a
married
man
exactly
opposite
there
is
a
house
of
accommodation
and
close
by
there
is
a
midwife
whose
announces
institute
for
ladies
of
condition
where
they
can
go
through
their
confinement
in
retirement
i
can
assure
the
reader
that
in
this
sketch
of
sexual
and
family
life
in
berlin
i
have
extenuated
nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
in
estimating
the
effects
of
the
suppression
of
brothels
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
medical
testimony
in
loewe
pamphlet
prostitution
with
reference
to
berlin
we
find
in
vain
the
charité
after
the
ordinary
wards
were
full
of
venereal
patients
set
aside
other
parts
of
the
building
the
patients
were
still
poured
in
from
the
houses
of
detention
until
at
length
the
directors
of
the
charité
refused
farther
admission
the
consequence
of
which
was
a
long
and
angry
correspondence
between
them
and
the
police
the
minister
of
the
interior
interfered
and
ordered
more
accommodation
for
the
charité
this
was
done
but
the
new
wards
were
soon
filled
with
venereal
females
the
patients
exceeded
the
accommodations
and
at
last
it
was
found
necessary
to
take
the
cholera
lazaret
for
syphilitic
cases
against
this
arrangement
the
magistracy
of
berlin
remonstrated
that
the
present
influx
of
venereal
patients
must
be
regarded
as
the
inevitable
natural
consequence
of
the
abolition
of
the
brothels
that
this
abolition
had
not
originated
with
them
therefore
they
were
not
bound
to
provide
for
it
behrend
to
whose
work
we
have
already
alluded
gives
much
statistical
information
from
original
documents
showing
the
results
of
suppression
he
says
in
out
of
women
brought
to
punishment
for
begging
and
similar
offenses
there
were
about
common
unregistered
prostitutes
in
the
period
of
reducing
the
number
of
brothels
there
were
such
women
in
a
year
after
their
suppression
there
were
notorious
prostitutes
those
in
the
opinion
of
the
police
constituted
but
a
portion
of
those
who
practiced
prostitution
but
yet
had
an
apparent
means
of
living
behind
the
königsmauer
the
traffic
is
carried
on
worse
than
formerly
while
the
place
itself
is
the
scene
of
disorder
and
irregularity
which
used
not
to
be
under
the
former
system
these
offenses
can
not
be
punished
owing
to
the
difficulties
of
technical
proof
which
must
always
exist
the
police
have
done
what
is
possible
by
continually
patrolling
the
streets
and
arresting
openly
objectionable
characters
and
even
those
who
are
informed
against
as
being
diseased
but
they
can
do
no
more
prostitution
which
was
formerly
confined
within
a
limited
district
is
now
spread
over
the
whole
respecting
the
influence
of
the
withdrawal
of
toleration
upon
the
public
health
behrend
concludes
there
is
a
greater
amount
of
syphilis
he
gives
the
following
list
of
cases
in
the
charité
year
females
males
he
also
investigated
the
average
time
each
patient
was
under
treatment
as
tending
to
show
the
malignity
of
the
disease
and
reports
year
men
days
women
days
both
sexes
these
facts
are
corroborated
by
the
registers
of
the
military
lazaret
from
returns
made
to
the
police
department
by
herr
lohmeyer
general
staff
physician
it
appears
there
were
in
the
garrison
in
and
syphilitic
cases
of
these
cases
of
primary
syphilis
required
days
of
attendance
secondary
in
and
the
first
six
months
of
there
were
cases
cases
of
primary
syphilis
required
days
of
attendance
secondary
behrend
states
as
the
results
of
conversations
and
communications
with
many
of
the
medical
profession
and
of
his
own
experience
that
in
the
last
four
years
there
are
more
cases
of
syphilis
that
in
consequence
of
the
increased
facilities
for
communication
the
disease
has
spread
to
the
small
towns
and
villages
that
it
has
been
introduced
more
frequently
into
private
families
that
the
character
of
the
disease
is
more
obstinate
thereby
operating
severely
on
the
constitution
and
on
future
generations
that
since
the
abolition
of
the
toleration
system
unnatural
crimes
have
been
much
more
frequently
met
with
as
to
the
influence
on
public
morals
he
contends
that
the
abolition
has
produced
the
most
injurious
consequences
particularly
alluding
to
the
desecration
of
matrimony
he
says
it
is
common
for
persons
of
vicious
habits
to
arrange
a
marriage
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
them
to
avoid
the
police
interference
this
marriage
bond
is
broken
when
convenient
and
other
marriages
are
formed
sometimes
two
couples
will
mutually
exchange
and
go
through
the
ceremony
he
also
made
inquiries

registered

nationality
of

of

but
very
few
remarks
are
necessary
concerning
prostitution
in
leipzig
where
no
striking
peculiarity
marks
the
common
women
as
a
class
and
the
legislation
is
based
on
the
ordinary
german
principle
of
toleration
if
we
reckon
its
garrison
as
a
part
of
the
population
of
the
town
the
number
of
inhabitants
will
amount
to
about
one
hundred
thousand
nearly
one
third
of
whom
are
soldiers
or
transient
residents
it
is
subject
to
many
fluctuations
at
various
times
but
the
general
average
may
be
assumed
at
the
number
stated
of
the
permanent
residents
there
are
about
six
hundred
well
known
and
professed
male
rogues
and
blacklegs
these
are
under
the
constant
and
vigilant
of
the
police
they
unquestionably
exert
a
considerable
influence
on
the
female
morality
of
the
place
not
only
from
their
own
for
which
men
of
this
character
are
notorious
wherever
located
but
by
the
agency
they
frequently
assume
to
arrange
the
pleasures
of
their
victims
and
acquaintances
it
need
therefore
occasion
no
surprise
to
ascertain
that
in
addition
to
about
three
hundred
registered
prostitutes
who
are
subject
to
medical
and
police
supervision
there
are
about
twelve
hundred
women
who
notoriously
frequent
the
city
from
the
neighboring
towns
and
villages
for
purposes
of
prostitution
whenever
a
large
influx
of
visitors
makes
it
probable
that
leipzig
will
be
a
lucrative
market
for
them
these
are
not
directly
under
any
police
control
to
this
number
of
fifteen
hundred
avowed
and
known
prostitutes
who
are
to
be
found
in
the
city
during
busy
seasons
of
the
year
must
be
added
the
class
of
irregular
or
private
courtesans
mostly
composed
of
domestics
it
is
estimated
there
are
three
thousand
in
the
city
and
the
habits
of
a
large
number
of
them
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
including
them
in
this
enumeration
indeed
those
who
have
had
the
best
opportunities
for
observation
do
not
hesitate
to
assert
that
at
least
one
third
are
vicious
assuming
this
to
be
an
accurate
calculation
we
have
prostitutes
or
one
in
every
forty
of
the
gross
population
exclusive
of
kept
mistresses
or
those
frail
women
in
the
more
aristocratic
circles
of
society
who
should
properly
be
classed
with
them
in
this
respect
we
have
no
reason
to
conclude
that
leipzig
is
either
better
or
worse
than
other
large
cities
of
the
present
day
there
are
about
common
brothels
in
leipzig
the
majority
of
which
are
registered
and
closely
watched
by
the
police
they
are
situated
in
the
lowest
and
least
frequented
parts
of
the
city
and
many
of
them
present
in
excess
some
of
the
worst
features
of
such
places
to
escape
their
annoyances
as
far
as
possible
and
retain
that
outward
show
of
respectability
most
acceptable
to
their
visitors
many
of
the
prostitutes
have
private
lodgings
in
various
parts
of
the
town
resorting
to
every
conceivable
disguise
to
conceal
or
modify
their
real
character
very
many
of
them
are
said
to
be
married
women
whose
husbands
not
merely
connive
at
but
frequently
compel
this
loathsome
trade
for
the
sake
of
its
emoluments
the
proprietors
of
the
tolerated
brothels
assume
a
virtue
if
they
have
it
not
and
seek
to
disguise
their
houses
under
the
names
of
or
restaurants
a
course
recognized
by
the
authorities
who
do
not
insist
upon
calling
such
places
by
the
vernacular
designation
as
is
done
in
hamburg
or
berlin
the
women
inhabiting
these
houses
are
principally
natives
of
altenburg
berlin
dresden
or
brunswick
those
from
the
latter
district
are
noted
by
travelers
for
their
personal
beauty
very
few
polish
women
are
found
here
the
requisite
supply
of
women
is
kept
up
through
the
agency
of
procuresses
as
in
hamburg
who
are
remunerated
by
the
in
proportion
to
the
distance
they
have
traveled
to
secure
recruits
or
according
to
the
attractions
of
the
girl
or
her
probable
success
in
the
establishment
in
regard
to
dress
manners
conduct
and
the
other
incidents
of
their
calling
there
is
little
distinction
between
the
prostitutes
of
leipzig
and
those
of
other
european
cities
a
late
anonymous
writer
gives
them
credit
as
a
class
for
a
studious
literary
habit
and
names
a
somewhat
intelligent
selection
of
light
works
as
those
they
prefer
to
read
such
as
the
writings
of
fredrika
bremer
bulwer
walter
scott
caroline
pichler
schiller
and
others
if
this
statement
be
correct
it
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
great
local
demand
for
literature
books
and
furs
being
universally
known
as
the
great
staples
of
leipzig
and
the
fact
can
scarcely
be
assumed
as
indicative
of
any
especial
inclination
for
prostitution
and
studious
habits
or
reflective
minds
are
very
seldom
associated
the
majority
of
the
are
stated
to
be
in
their
tastes
they
keep
the
women
plentifully
supplied
with
cards
and
dominoes
which
they
use
more
for
the
purpose
of
predicting
good
fortunes
to
their
visitors
and
themselves
than
for
gambling
we
have
never
heard
that
any
of
their
liberal
prognostications
have
been
verified
apparently
the
same
usages
and
habits
of
life
prevail
among
the
common
women
of
leipzig
as
among
those
of
paris
hamburg
berlin
london
or
elsewhere
indolent
from
the
nature
of
their
position
envious
from
their
relationship
to
their
compeers
their
life
would
seem
to
pass
in
a
routine
of
doing
nothing
with
considerable
zest
or
of
quarreling
among
each
other
with
noteworthy
animation
no
material
variation
from
the
ordinary
routine
of
sickness
caused
by
prostitution
has
been
discovered

number
of
strangers
may
happen
to
be
in
the
city
the
medical
and
police
surveillance
of
prostitutes
in
european
countries
being
modeled
almost
literally
from
one
system
as
is
also
the
strictness
with
which
it
is
now
enforced
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
any
thing
of
its
workings
in
leipzig
farther
than
the
fact
that
the
variable
and
floating
nature
of
the
population
at
times
makes
its
application
a
difficult
task
a
description
of
it
would
be
only
a
repetition
of
what
has
already
been
said
of
paris
hamburg
or
berlin
the
great
fairs
draw
a
large
concourse
of
strangers
from
all
parts
of
the
world
to
leipzig
and
its
geographical
position
beyond
the
centre
of
europe
brings
it
so
close
to
the
frontiers
of
turkey
poland
the
danubian
provinces
and
russia
that
the
scene
at
these
meetings
is
perhaps
more
motley
and
curious
in
race
costume
and
characteristics
than
in
any
other
city
in
the
world
among
so
heterogeneous
a
mass
there
exist
many
standards
of
morality
the
habits
of
some
of
the
visitors
entail
a
large
share
of
sorrows
on
the
prostitutes
more
in
fact
than
are
generally
experienced
by
any
but
the
very
lowest
grade
of
women
in
other
places
when
in
the
tolerated
houses
these
rude
hordes
abandon
themselves
to
the
grossest
licentiousness
use
expressions
compared
with
which
the
ordinary
conversation
of
brothels
is
chaste
and
refined
and
seek
to
extinguish
every
vestige
of
shame
or
womanly
feeling
in
their
companions
if
a
woman
ventures
to
remonstrate
at
such
extravagant
lewdness
the
reply
is
well
now
be
silent
i
have
paid
you
and
you
are
mine
as
long
as
i
have
you
it
may
therefore
be
easily
credited
that
during
such
periods
no
shadow
of
decency
can
be
found
in
the
common
houses
any
which
exists
and
truth
compels
the
admission
that
it
is
very
rare
during
the
crowded
season
can
only
be
traced
among
those
women
who
have
private
lodgings
the
only
compensation
for
such
depravity
is
found
in
the
large
sums
obtained
by
the
women
from
their
lovers
in
some
cases
amounting
to
forty
thalers
about
thirty
dollars
per
week
of
this
one
half
always
goes
to
the
as
his
share
and
calculating
his
expenses
to
be
five
thalers
per
week
for
the
board
and
lodging
of
each
woman
it
will
be
seen
that
his
profits
are
not
inconsiderable
the
sum
retained
by
the
women
is
spent
for
articles
of
dress
pleasure
etc
this
calculation
is
for
a
time
when
the
town
is
in
the
full
tide
of
commercial
prosperity
but
if
we
assume
the
average
receipts
at
ordinary
times
to
be
one
half
only
we
shall
be
able
to
form
a
tolerably
good
idea
of
the
financial
result
of
prostitution

leipzig

prostitutes
are
very
numerous
in

this
might
be
expected
from
the
mixed
character
of
the
city
at
once
a
capital
military
station
and
it
has
been
remarked
by
a
traveler
of
great
experience
that
it
is
very
rare
to
see
a
drunken
man
or
a
in
copenhagen
all
seem
to
have
a
home
or
a
place
to
go
to
and
the
general
character
of
the
danes
is
that
of
an
orderly
educated
people
some
of
the
prostitutes
of
copenhagen
live
in
a
kind
of
hotel
where
they
hold
public
entertainments
others
live
in
brothels
and
others
still
have
private
lodgings
there
is
nothing
remarkable
enough
about
them
to
call
for
any
particular
description
they
are
under
police
regulation
to
some
extent
and
receive
a
sort
of
half
permission
which
is
not
withdrawn
during
good
conduct
a
regulation
is
extant
which
professes
to
limit
the
number
of
children
they
are
allowed
to
bear
without
becoming
amenable
to
the
law
as
criminals
it
requires
that
the
mother
of
more
than
two
illegitimate
children
be
fined
and
imprisoned
as
may
be
readily
imagined
the
law
is
very
rarely
enforced
its
impolicy
if
rigorously
applied
being
since
it
would
operate
as
a
direct
premium
for
abortion
formal
concessions
are
not
granted
either
to

with
whom
they
lodge
neither
are
there
in
denmark
brothels
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
as
they
are
found
in
other
countries
so
writes
a
danish
official
his
distinction
is
too
nice
to
be
appreciated
the
copenhagen
police
know
of
the
existence
of
such
women
and
put
them
under
strict
regulations
not
altogether
prohibitory
they
control
and
interfere
with
prostitutes
they
do
not
tolerate

that
if

nothing

strongly
similar

that

of

both

the
delineation

characteristics
and
individual
propensities
or
delinquencies
are
unimportant
except
so
far
as
they
illustrate
national
character
it
has
been
well
observed
that
a
virtue
or
vice
does
not
consist
in
the
arithmetical
increase
or
decrease
of
immoral
actions
but
in
the
prevailing
sentiment
of
an
age
or
people
which
condemns
or
approves
them
it
is
in
this
respect
that
the
conduct
of
monarchs
and
courtiers
becomes
of
importance
in
the
estimate
of
national
manners
especially
in
a

the
czar
of

is
at
once
the
religious
and
political
leader
of

and
his
personal
conduct
becomes
the
standard
of
their
moral
relations
offering
encouragement
and
support
to
the
good
or
sanction
and
justification
to
the
depraved
peter
first
wife
eudoxia
was
a
woman
of
virtue
and
merit
neither
her
youth
nor
beauty
secured
the
affections
of
her
husband
she
did
not
escape
the
voice
of
slander
gleboff
her
alleged
lover
was
impaled
by
peter
who
went
to
see
him
writhing
in
his
death
agonies
when
the
wretched
man
avenged
himself
in
the
only
way
left
him
he
spat
in
the
czar
face
eudoxia
was
subsequently
sent
to
a
nunnery
at
moscow
by
peter
orders
and
at
last
took
the
veil
under
the
name
of
helena
scarcely
had
peter
attained
the
crown
when
he
formed
a
connection
with
catharine
the
romantic
history
of
her
origin
and
elevation
is
too
well
known
to
repeat
here
her
husband
a
swedish
dragoon
was
living
and
she
was
the
mistress
first
of
marshal
sheremeloff
then
of
mentchikoff
in
whose
house
peter
saw
her
and
whence
he
took
her
she
acquired
great
influence
over
the
czar
untamed
ferocity
and
to
her
infinite
credit
this
influence
was
always
used
to
mitigate
the
fearful
rigor
of
his
punishments
and
to
soothe
his
otherwise
implacably
revengeful
spirit
during
the
lifetime
of
her
husband
and
of
his
first
wife
peter
married
her
the
pleasing
traits
of
catharine
character
were
obscured
by
the
irregularity
of
her
life
raised
by
the
affection
of
peter
to
the
imperial
throne
she
set
an
example
of
dissoluteness
to
her
subjects
there
is
ample
reason
for
believing
that
she
had
several
intrigues
during
peter
lifetime
but
the
case
of
moens
de
la
croix
is
beyond
question
and
the
discovery
of
her
infidelity
in
this
instance
led
to
her
separation
from
peter
and
the
death
of
her
lover
in
after
the
campaign
against
the
turks
in
which
catharine
had
accompanied
the
czar
and
had
by
her
spirit
and
example
kept
up
the
courage
of
the
army
amid
great
difficulties
and
reverses
peter
determined
on
publicly
crowning
her
a
ceremony
very
unusual
in
russia
and
almost
tantamount
to
declaring
her
his
successor
moens
de
la
croix
was
the
young
brother
of
anne
de
la
croix
one
of
peter
early
mistresses
he
was
catharine
chamberlain
his
office
brought
him
in
close
attendance
on
the
empress
and
an
intimacy
was
established
this
was
for
a
time
notorious
to
every
one
except
peter
himself
at
length
however
his
suspicions
were
aroused
and
by
setting
spies
on
catharine
he
became
a
personal
witness
to
her
infidelity
the
first
explosion
of
his
resentment
was
terrific
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
executing
both
the
empress
and
her
paramour
but
by
the
temperate
advice
of
some
of
his
friends
who
counseled
him
to
avoid
a
scandal
it
was
determined
to
arrest
moens
on
a
false
charge
of
conspiracy
moens
and
his
sister
were
accordingly
seized
and
confined
in
an
apartment
in
the
winter
palace
peter
permitted
nobody
to
approach
them
and
took
them
their
food
with
his
own
hands
when
they
were
examined
as
to
the
conspiracy
moens
to
save
the
empress
with
the
public
confessed
to
every
thing
he
was
accordingly
condemned
and
beheaded
his
sister
was
knouted
and
sent
to
siberia
catharine
had
presented
her
lover
with
her
miniature
on
a
bracelet
which
he
always
wore
as
he
walked
to
his
death
he
managed
to
deliver
it
unperceived
to
the
lutheran
minister
who
accompanied
him
with
instructions
to
convey
it
back
to
the
empress
privately
which
was
accomplished
the
czar
was
a
spectator
of
the
execution
after
which
the
head
of
the
culprit
was
fixed
on
a
stake
according
to
custom
to
terrify
catharine
the
more
effectually
peter
drove
her
round
the
head
of
her
lover
happily
for
her
she
managed
to
preserve
during
the
torture
of
this
horrid
spectacle
after
this
the
czar
only
spoke
to
her
in
public
at
peter
death
catharine
ascended
the
throne
of
russia
by
virtue
of
a
pretended
dying
declaration
of
her
husband
she
went
through
a
pantomime
of
sorrows
and
tears
over
his
body
but
as
soon
as
she
was
firmly
seated
she
abandoned
herself
to
pleasure
and
voluptuousness
and
had
two
lovers
prince
sapicha
and
loewenwolden
at
the
same
time
these
two
rivals
equally
strove
to
please
her
and
alternately
received
proofs
of
her
tenderness
without
suffering
their
happiness
to
be
marred
by
jealousy
the
irregularity
of
the
empress
life
and
her
intemperate
use
of
ardent
liquors
hastened
her
death
which
took
place
in
her
year
peter
himself
was
a
wretched
example
of
conjugal
infidelity
and
low
debauchery
his
associates
were
often
of
the
very
lowest
of
the
populace
it
is
true
that
in
his
time
the
highest
were
not
much
removed
from
their
inferiors
in
decency
of
manners
while
the
inferiors
often
had
the
advantage
if
not
of
intellectual
cultivation
at
least
of
practical
intelligence
in
which
peter
took
delight
he
spent
many
of
his
hours
drinking
brandy
and
other
liquors
with
sailors
carpenters
and
artisans
irrespective
of
his
temporary
assumption
of
the
working
man
pursuits
he
consorted
indiscriminately
with
women
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
eventually
he
contracted
the
venereal
disease
from
neglect
and
the
general
depravity
of
his
life
the
disease
became
so
aggravated
that
at
last
it
proved
the
indirect
cause
of
his
death
he
himself
used
to
say
that
he
had
taken
it
from
madame
tchnertichoff
wife
of
the
general
and
diplomatist
of
that
name
upon
the
fact
being
mentioned
to
her
whether
casually
or
with
does
not
appear
she
is
reported
to
have
replied
very
naïvely
that
she
had
not
given
it
to
him
but
that
he
on
the
contrary
had
such
loose
habits
and
low
associates
that
he
had
given
it
to
her
it
was
in
that
peter
was
attacked
with
this
malady
and
while
suffering
from
it
he
marched
into
persia
and
shared
the
fatigues
of
the
meanest
soldier
throughout
the
campaign
the
heat
drought
and
constant
dust
increased
the
disease
frightfully
and
the
pains
became
so
excruciating
that
he
could
not
conceal
them
from
his
immediate
attendants
still
however
he
would
not
consult
the
court
physician
but
directed
his
servant
to
get
advice
as
if
for
some
one
else
he
then
went
to
the
hot
baths
of
plonetz
and
apparently
recovered
but
it
seems
the
disease
was
not
cured
it
was
merely
palliated
by
this
treatment
and
he
was
obliged
on
a
relapse
to
have
recourse
to
the
regular
physicians
and
for
three
months
his
life
was
despaired
of
at
last
he
recovered
but
now
in
spite
of
all
warnings
he
resumed
his
usual
habits
of
life
renewed
his
long
and
severe
journeys
his
public
works
and
his
general
activity
of
mind
and
body
while
he
in
nowise
amended
other
and
more
injurious
pursuits
and
practices
on
november
while
on
a
journey
to
finland
he
stopped
at
the
port
of
lachta
there
from
the
shore
he
saw
a
small
vessel
full
of
soldiers
and
sailors
which
had
struck
upon
a
shoal
perceiving
their
imminent
danger
he
shouted
to
them
but
the
boisterous
wind
drowned
his
voice
he
sprang
into
a
skiff
pulled
out
to
the
shoal
and
having
reached
the
vessel
jumped
into
the
water
got
her
off
and
landed
the
passengers
all
safe
he
neglected
all
the
precautions
necessary
in
the
then
state
of
his
health
and
was
seized
with
violent
fever
and
at
the
same
time
his
former
pangs
came
on
with
all
their
old
force
he
was
taken
back
to
petersburg
where
he
obtained
partial
relief
from
his
sufferings
he
employed
one
of
his
intervals
of
ease
in
celebrating
the
great
festival
of
blessing
the
waters
of
the
neva
and
by
his
intemperance
in
the
festivities
renewed
his
attack
and
after
a
period
of
protracted
agony
died
on
the
of
january
peter
is
described
as
having
been
excessively
libidinous
in
temperament
and
his
coarse
promiscuous
amours
were
made
the
common
subject
of
his
jocularity
even
in
the
presence
of
catharine
he
was
even
addicted
to
abominable
depravities
which
are
stated
by
contemporary
writers
to
have
been
the
common
practice
of
the
russians
at
that
time
peter
at
times
gave
way
to
fits
of
lust
in
which
like
a
furious
beast
he
regarded
neither
age
nor
sex
unnatural
vices
were
punished
in
the
russian
army
at
this
time
by
an
express
military
regulation
and
the
crime
was
a
standing
reproach
with
the
people
who
were
said
to
have
acquired
it
from
the
greeks
of
the
lower
empire
anne
the
successor
of
peter
and
catharine
had
two
publicly
avowed
lovers
dolgorouki
and
ernest
john
biren
the
latter
was
the
better
known
as
his
influence
and
importance
during
anne
reign
were
very
great
dolgorouki
had
become
one
of
the
deputies
to
announce
to
anne
her
succession
to
the
throne
which
office
he
accepted
with
the
hope
of
being
able
to
resume
his
former
intimate
relations
with
his
future
sovereign
when
he
entered
the
apartments
he
found
a
man
in
mean
apparel
seated
by
the
side
of
the
princess
he
ordered
him
to
withdraw
and
upon
his
inattention
to
the
order
took
him
by
the
arm
to
turn
him
out
when
the
empress
stopped
him
this
unknown
person
was
biren
who
became
regent
of
the
empire
anne
was
not
sunk
in
the
same
abyss
of
profligacy
as
her
successor
elizabeth
nor
in
brutality
as
her
ancestor
peter
she
had
been
brought
up
in
courland
and
had
acquired
some
little
refinement
of
ideas
and
manners
gluttony
and
drunkenness
were
somewhat
less
in
vogue
at
her
court
but
dissipation
ruinous
gambling
and
boundless
extravagance
were
in
full
fashion
the
whole
court
became
a
body
of
buffoons
and
jokers
and
the
most
absurd
and
preposterous
fashions
of
dress
the
rudest
and
most
boisterous
romps
and
gambols
were
generally
practiced
as
a
specimen
of
court
manners
the
practical
joke
played
on
prince
galitzin
in
which
there
was
as
much
malice
as
fun
may
be
remembered
having
given
offense
by
changing
his
religion
the
prince
was
compulsorily
married
to
a
girl
of
the
lowest
birth
a
palace
was
built
in
his
honor
but
the
material
was
ice
and
all
the
furniture
was
composed
of
the
same
the
wedding
procession
consisting
of
more
than
three
hundred
persons
in
their
national
costumes
who
had
been
collected
from
all
the
provinces
of
russia
passed
along
the
streets
the
couple
were
mounted
in
a
pagoda
on
the
back
of
an
elephant
when
the
ball
was
over
the
bride
and
bridegroom
were
conducted
to
their
nuptial
chamber
like
the
rest
of
the
house
all
of
ice
and
were
there
installed
in
an
ice
bedstead
and
guards
were
posted
at
the
door
to
prevent
them
escaping
from
the
room
before
morning
anne
died
in
and
after
a
short
interregnum
elizabeth
daughter
of
peter
came
to
the
throne
she
inherited
all
her
father
vices
and
sensuality
but
none
of
his
great
qualities
before
she
became
empress
elizabeth
had
outraged
all
propriety
had
openly
carried
on
an
improper
intercourse
with
the
and
soldiers
of
the
guards
who
had
been
quartered
near
her
dwelling
the
lust
and
drunkenness
in
which
she
wallowed
indisposed
her
from
all
longings
after
greatness
but
there
were
others
who
needed
her
name
and
a
conspiracy
being
formed
she
became
empress
in
spite
of
herself
her
chief
paramour
at
the
time
was
grunstein
sergeant
in
the
guards
who
was
elevated
to
the
rank
of
the
other
soldiers
and
officers
who
had
been
the
ministers
of
her
lewdness
were
made
officers
these
individuals
frequented
the
common
public
houses
got
drunk
made
their
way
into
the
houses
of
persons
of
condition
and
committed
all
sorts
of
depredations
with
impunity
when
the
men
who
could
boast
of
the
empress
favors
became
intolerable
they
were
drafted
off
to
the
army
as
officers
in
regiments
on
service
elizabeth
is
said
to
have
been
privately
married
to
razamoffsky
as
also
to
the
chevalier
who
visited
the
court
of
russia
in
the
disguise
of
a
woman
and
undoubtedly
enjoyed
elizabeth
favors
whatever
may
be
the
truth
about
her
marriage
to
him
elizabeth
withdrew
herself
for
whole
months
from
business
and
was
drunk
for
days
or
even
weeks
consecutively
she
had
a
reputation
for
humanity
but
although
she
sentenced
no
one
to
death
not
less
than
eighty
thousand
of
her
subjects
were
tortured
or
sent
to
siberia
during
her
reign
her
extravagance
was
such
that
when
she
died
there
were
in
her
wardrobe
some
fifteen
thousand
dresses
thousands
of
pairs
of
sleeves
and
several
hundred
pieces
of
french
and
other
silks
catharine
ii
of
russia
was
like
peter
a
compound
of
the
noblest
intellectual
endowments
with
a
moral
organization
of
unsurpassed
depravity
she
has
usually
been
considered
a
monster
of
lust
but
she
was
no
less
infamous
for
her
cruelty
and
for
the
total
absence
of
all
those
qualities
and
feelings
which
form
the
chief
grace
and
beauty
of
inner
life
her
favorite
in
the
tauric
palace
was
adorned
with
pictures
representing
the
sacking
of
ohkzakoff
and
ismail
in
which
the
painter
had
surpassed
the
gloomy
vision
of
a
carravaggio
and
had
depicted
the
assault
the
carnage
the
mutilation
and
all
the
hideous
details
of
such
scenes
in
these
catharine
is
said
to
have
taken
great
delight
she
hated
music
and
never
could
permit
other
sounds
than
those
of
drums
trumpets
and
similar
barbaric
instruments
within
her
hearing
and
yet
it
is
said
that
in
her
outset
in
life
as
princess
of
anhalt
zerbst
she
had
a
womanly
heart
delicacy
of
taste
and
refinement
of
intellect
that
it
was
not
till
long
after
her
husband
peter
had
insulted
her
by
open
neglect
of
her
very
winning
person
and
youthful
graces
and
had
abandoned
her
for
the
vulgar
and
ugly
princess
woronzoff
that
she
committed
herself
to
the
terrible
career
which
she
afterward
pursued
so
steadily
the
duchesse
in
her
memoir
of
catharine
tells
us
that
her
first
lover
soltikoff
was
forced
upon
her
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
by
the
crafty
and
unscrupulous
bestujeff
the
able
minister
of
elizabeth
for
the
sake
of
procuring
an
heir
to
the
grand
duke
peter
catharine
remonstrated
and
threatened
to
complain
to
whom
will
you
complain
asked
the
minister
coldly
catharine
submitted
and
accepted
the
lover
thus
imposed
upon
her
at
the
time
of
this
adultery
for
expediency
sake
catharine
was
deeply
intent
upon
study
with
a
view
to
qualify
herself
worthily
for
her
future
destiny
disgusted
as
she
was
with
the
indecencies
of
the
russian
court
subsequently
it
was
considered
expedient
to
remove
soltikoff
catharine
had
given
birth
to
a
child
and
was
not
pleased
with
this
dismissal
but
the
impassible
bestujeff
only
sneered
at
her
remonstrances
and
professions
of
affection
for
the
dismissed
lover
and
recommended
her
to
choose
another
this
was
a
lesson
she
was
not
slow
to
carry
out
the
list
of
her
paramours
was
little
less
numerous
than
that
of
elizabeth
after
catharine
had
caused
peter
iii
to
be
murdered
and
had
ascended
the
throne
as
empress
in
her
own
right
she
abandoned
herself
to
the
fullest
gratification
of
her
passions
both
royal
and
personal
besides
the
vulgar
crowd
whom
she
selected
as
the
recipients
of
her
filthy
favors
the
world
knew
as
the
public
and
recognized
paramours
the
names
of
orloff
by
whom
she
had
a
son
called
count
bobruski
wassilitchikoff
potemkin
louskoi
mornonoff
and
zuboff
these
were
appointed
in
a
manner
that
was
reduced
to
a
system
and
an
etiquette
was
established
as
precise
as
that
of
naming
a
state
minister
when
catharine
was
tired
of
her
present
favorite
one
of
her
intimate
friends
was
commissioned
to
look
out
for
another
at
other
times
her
notice
having
fallen
on
some
young
man
who
pleased
her
fancy
she
signified
her
wishes
to
some
female
friend
and
thereupon
an
entertainment
was
arranged
at
the
lady
house
which
the
empress
honored
with
her
presence
and
thereby
gained
an
opportunity
of
closer
acquaintanceship
with
the
chosen
individual
he
then
received
orders
to
attend
at
the
palace
where
he
was
introduced
to
the
court
physician
and
examined
as
to
his
general
health
and
physical
condition
after
this
he
was
placed
under
the
charge
of
a
certain
mademoiselle
protasoff
the
various
examinations
having
been
successfully
passed
the
favorite
was
installed
into
the
regular
apartments
of
office
which
were
immediately
contiguous
to
those
of
the
empress
on
the
first
day
of
his
installation
he
received
one
hundred
thousand
rubles
about
thousand
dollars
for
linen
and
an
allowance
of
twelve
thousand
rubles
per
month
besides
which
all
his
household
expenses
were
defrayed
he
was
required
to
attend
the
empress
wherever
she
went
and
was
not
permitted
to
leave
the
palace
without
her
permission
he
might
not
converse
familiarly
with
other
women
and
if
he
dined
with
his
friends
it
was
imperative
that
the
mistress
of
the
house
should
be
absent
when
a
favorite
had
completed
his
term
of
service
he
received
orders
to
travel
and
from
that
moment
all
access
to
her
majesty
was
denied
the
favorites
rarely
rebelled
against
their
destiny
in
this
particular
but
potemkin
and
orloff
who
had
far
other
views
than
those
of
dalliance
had
the
temerity
to
disobey
the
order
and
succeeded
in
retaining
power
and
the
friendship
of
the
empress
long
after
their
personal
claims
on
her
tenderness
were
at
an
end
on
terminating
the
intimacy
the
favorite
usually
received
magnificent
gifts
potemkin
after
he
had
ceased
his
functions
as
favorite
became
pander
to
his
royal
mistress
thereby
securing
the
double
advantage
of
the
favor
of
the
empress
and
the
patronage
of
the
favorite
from
whom
he
levied
a
handsome
fee
for
the
introduction
potemkin
and
orloff
were
at
one
period
rivals
in
which
contest
orloff
was
at
last
defeated
but
when
potemkin
reached
his
pride
of
place
he
became
so
necessary
to
catharine
in
his
higher
capacity
that
he
set
up
and
pulled
down
the
favorite
of
the
hour
as
he
pleased
and
even
ventured
upon
the
most
extravagant
flights
of
insolence
and
personal
disrespect
to
the
empress
orloff
had
been
also
the
rival
of
poniatowski
but
his
superior
capacity
and
brutal
energy
of
will
made
him
respected
and
feared
by
catharine
long
after
she
had
ceased
to
like
him
the
pecuniary
results
to
the
state
enormous
as
was
the
plunder
was
perhaps
the
least
of
the
evils
sustained
through
this
system
of
iniquity
the
registered
gifts
to
the
twelve
favorites
amounted
to
upward
of
one
hundred
million
dollars
lanskoi
who
had
held
no
political
offices
and
the
whole
of
whose
fortune
was
drawn
from
the
flagitious
profits
of
his
post
of
dishonor
died
after
less
than
four
years
of
office
worth
in
cash
only
and
exclusive
of
valuables
seven
millions
of
rubles
potemkin
wealth
which
was
accumulated
from
all
sources
of
public
robbery
and
private
extortion
was
fabulous
at
his
death
he
owned
two
hundred
thousand
serfs
he
had
whole
cupboards
filled
with
gold
coin
jewels
and
he
held
orders
and
his
fortune
was
estimated
at
sixty
million
dollars
in
the
closing
days
of
catharine
reign
she
found
a
lower
deep
into
which
to
plunge
when
upward
of
sixty
she
took
into
office
as
her
favorite
zuboff
who
was
not
quite
she
now
formed
the
society
of
the
little
hermitage
this
was
a
picked
company
of
wits
and
libertines
of
both
sexes
over
whose
scenes
of
debauchery
and
revelry
the
empress
presided
an
inner
penetralia
even
of
these
orgies
was
established
and
called
the
little
society
the
pernicious
influence
of
such
an
example
set
for
so
long
a
period
of
time
by
a
sovereign
distinguished
for
ability
and
whose
reign
had
been
rendered
famous
by
its
successful
foreign
enterprises
was
the
almost
universal
corruption
of
the
russian
court
and
aristocracy
of
both
sexes
the
women
in
imitation
of
her
majesty
kept
men
with
the
title
and
office
of
favorites
this
was
as
customary
as
any
other
piece
of
fashion
and
was
recognized
by
husbands
tender
intrigues
were
unknown
strong
passion
was
still
more
rare
marriage
was
merely
an
association
there
was
a
club
called
the
club
of
natural
philosophers
which
was
a
society
of
men
and
women
of
the
highest
classes
the
object
of
whose
meetings
was
indiscriminate
sexual
intercourse
the
members
met
to
feast
and
after
the
banquet
they
retired
in
pairs
chosen
by
lot
this
club
was
afterward
put
down
by
the
russian
police
in
common
with
all
other
secret
societies
a
hospital
was
founded
by
catharine
for
fifty
ladies
affected
with
venereal
disease
these
were
all
to
be
taken
care
of
no
question
was
permitted
as
to
name
or
quality
and
the
linen
of
the
establishment
was
marked
with
the
significant
word
discretion
catharine
end
was
sudden
and
frightful
she
had
grown
corpulent
and
her
legs
and
body
had
swollen
and
burst
she
moved
about
with
considerable
difficulty
although
her
imperious
will
would
not
allow
her
to
give
way
in
her
career
either
of
ambition
or
profligacy
she
was
at
the
little
hermitage
november
in
remarkably
high
spirits
and
even
joked
her
buffoon
leof
nauskin
among
other
things
as
to
his
death
and
his
fears
thereupon
the
next
morning
the
dread
messenger
of
whose
advent
she
had
made
sport
brought
his
orders
for
her
she
fell
into
an
apoplectic
fit
and
after
hours
of
insensibility
died
unblessing
and
unblessed
to
be
succeeded
by
paul
her
detested
son
by
her
first
lover
soltikoff
the
emperor
or
as
he
was
better
known
by
napoleon
sobriquet
the
mad
emperor
paul
was
too
remarkable
for
his
eccentricities
to
make
himself
conspicuous
for
his
gallantries
even
in
this
particular
he
preserved
his
eccentricity
he
neglected
his
wife
an
amiable
and
handsome
woman
the
mother
of
alexander
and
nicholas
for
an
ugly
mistress
mademoiselle
nelidoff
and
for
another
mademoiselle
lapukhin
who
would
not
accept
his
addresses
but
to
whom
he
nevertheless
professed
the
patient
devotion
of
don
quixote
the
most
noteworthy
circumstance
in
this
connection
of
paul
life
was
the
indirect
effect
of
female
frailty
in
procuring
his
murder
the
enemies
who
subsequently
plotted
his
downfall
and
destruction
procured
their
return
from
banishment
through
the
offices
of
a
certain
mademoiselle
chevalier
a
french
actress
who
ruled
kutaisoff
who
on
his
part
ruled
the
czar
as
we
approach
our
own
times
the
description
of
historical
characters
becomes
liable
to
the
tinge
of
prejudice
or
partiality
alexander
the
son
and
successor
of
paul
was
distinguished
by
the
amenity
of
his
disposition
and
the
philosophical
tone
of
his
political
theories
he
was
married
at
an
early
age
by
order
of
his
grandmother
catharine
who
in
his
case
insisted
on
making
him
a
good
husband
and
took
numerous
precautions
for
that
purpose
all
of
which
her
example
neutralized
or
belied
the
selection
made
for
him
might
under
the
conditions
of
humble
life
or
a
free
choice
have
turned
out
happily
as
it
was
he
preferred
the
society
of
the
ladies
of
his
court
and
in
particular
of
the
countess
narishkin
by
whom
he
had
three
children
the
countess
proved
inconstant
and
all
his
children
by
her
died
to
alexander
deep
grief
after
the
loss
of
these
illegitimate
children
the
affections
of
alexander
were
turned
toward
the
empress
whose
true
worth
he
recognized
when
it
was
too
late
she
was
struck
with
disease
and
he
was
on
a
journey
to
southern
russia
to
select
a
suitable
spot
for
a
residence
for
her
when
he
was
seized
with
the
fever
of
which
he
died
if
alexander
mild
character
had
but
little
influence
on
his
subjects
the
name
of
his
successor
nicholas
has
been
identified
with
the
very
existence
of
the
russian
people
as
much
as
any
sovereign
since
peter
the
great
his
example
and
expressed
will
have
had
immense
effect
both
for
good
and
evil
it
is
almost
impossible
to
arrive
at
the
true
character
of
nicholas
at
the
present
time
for
the
reasons
just
mentioned
in
his
private
life
as
husband
and
father
and
in
his
public
life
as
ruler
and
politician
writers
are
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other
party
prejudice
denies
him
all
worth
or
makes
him
a
very
socrates
golovin
and
authors
of
the
democratic
school
affirm
in
addition
to
his
other
offenses
that
nicholas
had
several
illegitimate
children
and
also
that
no
woman
could
feel
herself
secure
from
nicholas
importunities
while
writers
like
von
tietz
jermann
and
other
panegyrists
of
the
russian
court
describe
nicholas
as
an
exemplary
husband
and
father
a
model
to
his
subjects
in
his
domestic
relations
they
allege
farther
that
the
gross
immorality
which
has
been
the
chief
feature
of
russian
society
was
very
much
discouraged
and
rendered
altogether
unfashionable
by
the
estimable
manners
of
the
imperial
family
truth
is
rarely
found
in
extremes
the
prevalent
usage
among
sovereigns
in
this
century
has
been
to
assume
a
virtue
if
they
have
it
not
and
to
maintain
a
respectable
exterior
for
the
sake
of
public
opinion
so
politic
a
ruler
as
nicholas
was
not
likely
to
reject
this
he
did
all
that
could
be
done
to
bring
virtue
into
good
repute
at
court
but
too
many
little
incidents
are
told
of
him
to
justify
a
belief
in
his
perfect
spotlessness
the
characters
of
individuals
even
as
rulers
would
be
unimportant
to
us
were
it
not
that
in
russia
society
is
in
a
transition
state
and
shows
itself
plastic
in
the
hands
of
an
energetic
emperor
the
state
i
am
the
state
was
perfectly
true
in
the
mouth
of
nicholas
by
his
subjects
he
was
held
in
an
esteem
little
short
of
idolatry
and
he
was
in
every
sense
of
the
word
the
most
remarkable
man
in
his
vast
dominions
thompson
an
english
traveler
who
has
spoken
very
favorably
of
the
personal
worth
of
the
emperor
nicholas
says
of
the
morality
of
the
upper
classes
among
the
russians
denied
the
advantages
of
rational
amusement
and
innocent
social
enjoyments
deprived
of
those
resources
which
while
they
dispel
elevate
the
feelings
the
mind
resorts
to
sensual
indulgences
and
to
the
gratification
of
the
passions
for
the
purpose
of
finding
recreation
and
relief
from
the
deadening
pressure
of
despotism
immorality
and
intrigue
are
of
universal
prevalence
and
in
a
social
sense
are
hardly
looked
upon
as
criminal
acts
while
gambling
and
debauchery
are
the
natural
consequences
of
the
tedious
monotony
from
which
all
seek
to
escape
by
indulging
in
gross
and
vicious
excitement
under
the
system
of
serfage
now
approaching
its
end
it
was
almost
impossible
that
there
should
be
such
a
thing
as
public
morality
in
the
lower
classes
the
russians
both
noble
and
serf
are
false
and
dishonest
to
a
proverb
prostitution
in
such
cases
is
a
superfluous
term
a
woman
had
no
right
or
opportunity
to
be
virtuous
the
morality
of
petersburg
is
undoubtedly
of
the
lowest
and
yet
we
have
not
met
with
any
accounts
of
local
prostitution
there
it
is
a
city
of
men
containing
one
hundred
thousand
more
males
than
females
kelly
says
the
women
form
only
two
sevenths
of
the
entire
population
and
calls
it
an
alarming
fact
the
climate
is
unfavorable
to
female
beauty
and
it
is
generally
conceded
that
the
men
are
handsomer
than
the
women
the
german
girls
have
an
almost
exclusive
reputation
for
good
looks
in
petersburg
by
reason
of
the
disproportion
of
the
sexes
it
is
said
that
ladies
can
not
venture
out
unattended
this
is
etiquette
among
the
higher
classes
of
all
continental
europe
and
the
simple
fact
without
the
reason
would
not
be
surprising
the
attention
to
minutiæ
which
distinguishes
a
despotism
and
which
is
so
remarkable
a
feature
of
russian
state
craft
does
not
allow
us
to
suppose
there
are
no
statistical
papers
on
the
subject
of
prostitution
on
the
contrary
it
is
perfectly
well
known
that
such
are
in
existence
the
secrecy
which
is
scrupulously
maintained
in
all
public
matters
and
the
watchful
vigilance
of
the
police
over
strangers
prevents
them
obtaining
any
information
except
on
the
most
patent
and
notorious
subjects
the
remarks
of
travelers
on
russian
society
are
very
vague
and
general
and
unsupported
by
any
of
those
details
which
could
alone
authenticate
them
we
have
already
alluded
to
the
ancient
oriental
seclusion
of
women
among
the
russians
this
was
so
strict
that
a
suitor
never
saw
or
at
least
was
presumed
never
to
have
seen
the
face
of
his
bride
before
marriage
in
ivan
the
great
told
a
german
embassador
who
demanded
his
daughter
in
marriage
for
the
margrave
of
baden
that
russians
never
showed
their
daughters
to
any
one
before
the
match
was
decided
peter
the
great
abolished
this
lottery
and
directed
that
the
parties
might
see
each
other
but
he
still
found
it
necessary
to
promulgate
a
strong
ukase
against
parents
compelling
children
to
marry
against
their
wishes
the
compromise
of
the
ancient
custom
which
has
been
brought
about
by
this
law
is
that
the
elders
of
the
family
usually
for
the
juniors
then
succeeds
the
bridal
promenade
at
which
the
young
people
if
unknown
to
each
other
are
led
accidentally
to
meet
in
the
same
walk
having
thus
managed
an
interview
the
father
of
the
young
man
if
all
the
preliminaries
have
been
satisfactory
so
far
sends
to
the
bride
father
and
a
general
family
meeting
takes
place
at
which
the
arrangements
are
completed
the
dowry
determined
and
then
follows
the
betrothal
the
elect
pair
kneel
down
on
a
fur
mat
and
exchange
rings
the
preparations
for
the
marriage
are
commenced
during
which
time
the
lovers
have
frequent
opportunities
of
meeting
and
becoming
better
known
to
each
other
this
is
a
general
period
of
visiting
and
parties
on
the
the
bridemaids
unbraid
the
lady
hair
and
she
receives
her
husband
with
flowing
locks
this
is
a
remnant
of
ancient
russian
usage
when
the
greatest
outrage
that
could
be
committed
on
a
woman
was
to
unbraid
her
hair
it
is
generally
believed
that
among
the
lower
orders
the
wife
is
bound
to
draw
off
her
husband
boots
on
the
and
also
that
the
russian
peasant
beats
his
wife
at
the
commencement
of
her
married
life
so
as
to
indicate
supremacy
as
to
the
substantial
observance
of
the
latter
practice
modern
travelers
differ
although
it
would
seem
that
symbolically
it
is
still
maintained
a
curious
exhibition
takes
place
on
whitsunday
in
the
petersburg
summer
garden
called
the
bride
fair
all
the
marriageable
daughters
of
the
russian
tradesmen
turn
out
on
that
day
for
a
promenade
the
young
men
in
their
best
attire
come
forth
to
view
them
the
brides
expectant
do
not
limit
their
display
to
their
charms
but
second
them
by
attractions
of
a
more
substantial
character
adorning
themselves
with
trinkets
jewels
or
even
now
and
then
with
silver
plate
and
other
valuables
useful
in
housekeeping
this
has
been
inveighed
against
as
indicative
of
the
prevalent
indelicacy
of
the
russians
a
sort
of
is
it
more
reprehensible
than
many
customs
nearer
home
it
is
now
however
falling
into
disuse
the
conjugal
relations
of
the
russian
nobility
were
extremely
loose
and
indefensible
during
the
time
when
vice
was
fashion
and
virtue
in
a
courtier
would
have
been
deemed
condemnation
of
the
higher
powers
then
and
even
down
to
the
reign
of
the
emperor
nicholas
marriage
was
simply
an
affair
of
convenience
the
husband
living
at
moscow
or
petersburg
the
wife
in
paris
or
italy
such
separations
frequently
lasting
for
years
the
foundling
hospital
at
petersburg
the
is
the
most
magnificent
foundation
of
the
kind
in
europe
and
it
pleases
the
authorities
to
give
information
upon
its
features
the
endowments
are
enormous
owing
to
the
munificence
of
successive
sovereigns
who
have
made
it
a
kind
of
state
caprice
the
annual
expenditure
exceeds
five
millions
two
hundred
thousand
rubles
the
number
of
children
in
this

is
commensurate
with
its
wealth
upward
of
thousand

the

is
open

for

the
daily
average
of
children
brought
is
about
twenty
the
only
question
asked
is
if
the

has
been
baptized
and
by
what
name

not

the

the
mortality
which
takes
place
among
these
helpless

of

and
misfortune
is
enormous
some

in
the

when
just

which

the
total

an
incident
which
is
said
to
have
occurred
at
this

has
gone
the
rounds
of
the

the
story
is
that
one
of
the
young
women
having
given
birth
to
an
infant
and
the
delinquent
not
being
discovered
the
emperor
nicholas
heard
of

occurrence
and
made
a
visit
of
inspection
having
summoned
the
pupils
before
him
he
demanded
to
know
the
guilty
one
adding
that
if
she
came
forward
she
should
be
pardoned
no
one
obeyed
the
invitation
and
he
was
going
away
with
threats
of
disgracing
the
whole
body
when
one
girl
to
save
her
companions
came
forward
threw
herself
at
his
feet
and
confessed
her
fault
nicholas
kicked
her
out
of

that
it
was
too
late

this
standard

almost
any
country

the

of
the

be
indifferent

that
of
england
and
france
what
then
must
be
the
condition
of
the
towns
and
in
particular
of
the
capital
the
figures
are
such
as
to
justify
the
allegation
against
stockholm
of
being
the
most
immoral
capital
in
europe
and
also
the
presumption
that
the
late
decrease
in
its
population
from
which
it
is
but
recently
recovering
is
a
direct
consequence
of
the
vice
that
stains
it
with
so
large
an
amount
of
illegitimacy
it
is
not
surprising
that
infanticide
should
be
of
common
occurrence
the
penalty
of
this
crime
is
death
although
from
a
growing
aversion
to
capital
punishment
it
is
generally
commuted

are
numerous
foundling
hospitals
throughout

by
gustavus

for
the
children
of
military
men
of
broken
health
and

it
has
been
perverted
from
the
simplicity
of
its
original
foundation
and
now
receives
children
of
all
comers
who
pay
an
entrance
fee
of
about
dollars
no
questions
are
asked
on
the

of
an
infant
to
the
asylum
and
excepting
the
fee
it
is
in
no
respect
different
from
the
ordinary
foundling
hospitals
this
very
fee
however
it
is
considered
by
some
writers
makes
all
the
difference
as
it
in
some
measure
justifies
those
parents
who
having
adequate
means
choose
to
release
themselves
of
the
care
and
expense
of
their
offspring
and
who
use
this
payment
as
a
salve
to
their
consciences

that
they

to
that
extent
done
their
duty
the

an

of

one

per

in
prostitution
was
forbidden
by
express
enactment
throughout
all
sweden
and
women
who
had
not
a
legally
recognized
occupation
were
liable
to
imprisonment
as
disorderly
characters
the
prostitute
of
course
came
within
the
category
it
was
asserted
at
the
time
that
there
was
no
common
prostitution
but
a
counter
statement
was
made
by
the
jurist
angelot
who
affirmed
that
every
house
of
entertainment
was
a
brothel
and
every
servant
a
loose
woman
this
prohibitory
system
did
not
work
so
well
as
had
been
anticipated
and
in
a
change
was
effected
a
large
hotel
was
taken
by
the
corporation
and
after
the
plan
of
various
cities
in
the
middle
ages
was
managed
by
public
officers
thus
a
government
brothel
was
established
nor
did
this
lewdness
by
authority
have
the
desired
effect
the
brothel
was
filled
with
women
but
no
customers
appeared
private
brothels
were
resorted
to
for
a
time
and
were
opened
under
regular
licenses
they
have
now
disappeared
and
as
the
inefficient
police
management
never
succeeded
in
repressing
illicit
prostitution
even
while
tolerated
brothels
were
in
existence
it
will
surprise
no
one
to
learn
that
stockholm
is
now
one
vast
seething
of
private
harlotry
there
are
lock
hospitals
throughout
sweden
established
by
public
funds
and
kept
up
by
direct
taxation
as
a
charge
upon
the
municipal
rates
the
stockholm
hospital
for
syphilis
in
received
seven
hundred
and
one
patients
of
whom
one
hundred
and
were
from
the
country
and
the
remainder
from
the
city
the
capital
contained
in
that
year
persons
of
both
sexes
above
the
age
of
fifteen
consequently
person
in
every
was
affected
with
the
superficial
aspect
of
society
in
sweden
is
certainly
not
such
as
here
described
the
upper
classes
are
cultivated
polite
and
observant
of
all
the
usual
refinements
of
modern
society
while
to
the
humbler
classes
excepting
that
intercourse
is
free
and
unrestrained
among
them
there
is
no
ground
for
attributing
any
unusual
departure
from
modesty
and
propriety
neither
are
the
laws
remarkably
stringent
although
difficulties
are
thrown
in
the
way
of
affiliation
they
are
the
same
in
principle
as
those
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
modern
statute
law
of
england
still
that
there
is
such
an
excess
of
immorality
can
not
be
doubted
the
official
statistics
of
the
country
prove
it
were
any
possible
doubt
thrown
upon
the
statements
of
the
many
travelers
of
the
highest
repute
for
correctness
and
reliability
who
have
noticed
it
the
latest
publication
upon
the
matter
is
from
bayard
taylor
who
writing
from
stockholm
under
date
may
says
i
must
not
close
this
letter
without
saying
a
word
about
its
stockholm
morals
it
has
been
called
the
most
licentious
city
in
europe
and
i
have
no
doubt
with
the
most
perfect
justice
vienna
may
surpass
it
in
the
amount
of
conjugal
infidelity
but
certainly
not
in
general
incontinence
very
nearly
half
the
registered
births
are
illegitimate
to
say
nothing
of
the
illegitimate
children
born
in
wedlock
of
the
and
seamstresses
in
the
city
it
is
very
safe
to
say
that
scarcely
one
out
of
a
hundred
is
chaste
while
as
rakish
young
swedes
have
coolly
informed
me
a
large
proportion
of
girls
of
respectable
parentage
are
no
better
the
men
of
course
are
much
worse
than
the
women
and
even
in
paris
one
sees
fewer
physical
signs
of
excessive
debauchery
here
the
number
of
young
men
and
hoary
sinners
is
astonishing
i
have
never
been
in
any
place
where
licentiousness
was
so
open
and
avowed
and
yet
where
the
slang
of
a
sham
morality
was
so
prevalent
there
are
no
houses
of
prostitution
in
stockholm
and
the
city
would
be
scandalized
at
the
idea
of
allowing
such
a
thing
a
few
years
ago
two
were
established
and
the
fact
was
no
sooner
known
than
a
virtuous
mob
arose
and
violently
pulled
them
down
at
the
restaurants
young
blades
order
their
dinners
of
the
female
waiters
with
an
arm
around
their
waists
while
the
old
men
place
their
hands
unblushingly
upon
their
bosoms
all
the
baths
in
stockholm
are
attended
by
women
generally
and
hideous
i
must
confess
who
perform
the
usual
scrubbing
and
shampooing
with
the
greatest
nonchalance
one
does
not
wonder
when
he
is
told
of
young
men
who
have
passed
safely
through
the
ordeals
of
berlin
and
paris
and
have
come
at
last
to
stockholm
to
be
ruined
which
is
best
a
city
like
stockholm
where
prostitution
is
prohibited
or
new
york
where
it
is
tacitly
allowed
or
hamburg
where
it
is
legalized
we
have
spoken
of
the
difference
between
sweden
and
norway
in
their
moral
relations
at
first
this
is
not
apparent
for
illegitimacy
is
as
frequent
in
one
as
the
other
but
there
are
attendant
qualifying
circumstances
which
go
to
constitute
a
material
variation
in
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
the
unexplained
fact
we
may
remark
that
and
open
prostitution
are
rare
illegitimacy
is
of
considerable
extent
averaging
one
in
five
or
in
some
parts
one
in
three
of
the
total
births
the
people
are
betrothed
by
the
practice
of
the
lutheran
church
a
long
time
before
the
actual
marriage
this
is
considered
as
nothing
more
than
a
wholesome
check
upon
hasty
unions
in
a
general
point
of
view
in
norway
however
this
probationary
period
is
extended
to
a
limit
beyond
the
endurance
of
flesh
and
blood
the
wedding
is
a
prodigious
and
it
is
absolutely
indispensable
that
the
means
for
an
extravagant
hospitality
should
have
been
accumulated
before
the
parties
dare
attempt
the
public
ceremony
the
profusion
is
so
great
as
sometimes
to
dissipate
a
whole
year
earnings
the
obligation
to
this
expense
increases
the
delay
required
by
the
church
and
it
frequently
happens
that
the
affianced
cohabit
before
the
nuptial
benediction
is
pronounced
as
the
betrothal
is
a
the
arrangement
loses
part
of
its
offensive
character
in
the
eyes
of
the
parties
themselves
and
also
of
their
neighbors
the
children
are
legitimatized
by
the
subsequent
marriage
which
takes
place
in
by
far
the
largest
number
of
cases
in
those
occasional
instances
where
the
wedding
ceremony
is
not
duly
completed
there
is
a
particular
legal
act
by
which
a
child
can
be
acknowledged
failure
of
marriage
under
such
circumstances
or
failure
of
natural
duty
to
offspring
is
against
the
sentiment
of
the
people
while
these
facts
do
not
alter
the
actual
concubinage
or
illegitimacy
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
a
considerable
difference
exists
between
such
conduct
however
reprehensible
and
those
habits
which
may
be
fairly
characterized
as
licentiousness
or
profligacy
norway
is
very
far
from
being
free

a
physician
of
the

has
recently
endeavored
to
cure
syphilis
in
its
secondary
stage
by
means
of
inoculation
having
first
tried
the
experiment
upon
himself
and
there
is
now
a
hospital
where
this
form
of
treatment
is
practiced
upon
two
or
three
hundred
patients
with
the
greatest
success

intended
to

the
sight
of

around

so
sickened
me
that
i
had
no
courage
to
undertake
the
task
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
whether
the
malady
exists
with
the
same
virulence

the

among
the
crude

at
legislation
there
are

but
whether
the
necessity
for
these
enactments
was
owing
to
general
licentiousness
or
to
the
existence
of
a
regular
class
of
prostitutes
does
not
appear
at
the
period
of
the
roman
invasion
the
morals
of
the
britons
were
as
low
as
might
be
expected
from
their
nomadic
habits
the
population
was
divided
into
small
communities
of
men
and
women
who
appear
to
have
lived
promiscuously
no
woman
being
attached
to
any
particular
man
but
all
cohabiting
according
to
inclination
the
carnal
instinct
being
the
feeling
which
regulated
sexual
intercourse
a
sort
of
marriage
was
instituted
but
with
no
idea
that
either
of
the
parties
to
it
should
be
restricted
by
its
obligations
its
only
object
seemed
to
be
to
provide
means
for
rearing
the
children
and
to
fix
somewhere
the
responsibility
of
their
nurture
and
support
a
society
constituted
as
this
was
can
of
course
be
considered
scarcely
a
step
removed
from
barbarism
the
regulation
to
provide
for
the
children
was
necessary
to
prevent
depopulation
its
tendency
was
to
remove
from
the
woman
path
every
obstacle
to
lust
over
the
man
it
exercised
but
very
slight
control
a
still
farther
proof
of
the
demoralized
condition
of
the
people
is
found
in
the
gross
ceremonies
attending
these
marriages
the
man
appeared
on
his
wedding
day
dressed
in
all
the
rude
trappings
of
the
time
the
woman
was
entirely
naked
a
repulsive
coarseness
marked
their
licentiousness
and
the
rudeness
of
manners
was
nowhere
more
conspicuous
than
in
the
relations
existing
between
the
sexes
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
imported
into
england
the
laws
and
customs
prevailing
in
their
own
country
the
rules
they
made
against
adultery
were
frightfully
severe
when
a
couple
were
detected
in
the
commission
of
the
offense
the
woman
was
compelled
to
commit
suicide
to
avoid
the
greater
tortures
awaiting
her
if
she
refused
her
body
was
then
placed
on
a
pile
of
brushwood
and
consumed
nor
did
her
partner
in
guilt
escape
punishment
he
was
usually
put
to
death
on
the
spot
where
her
ashes
lay
collected
these
penalties
would
appear
to
be
sufficiently
severe
but
in
some
instances
worse
were
inflicted
where
the
case
was
one
of
peculiar
aggravation
the
adulteress
was
hunted
down
by
a
number
of
infuriate
demireps
of
her
own
sex
each
armed
with
a
club
a
knife
or
some
other
formidable
weapon
and
stabbed
or
beaten
to
death
if
one
party
of
her
pursuers
became
weary
of
the
sport
another
took
their
places
until
the
victim
expired
beneath
the
blows
these
extremely
rigid
ideas
of
the
do
not
seem
to
have
been
consistent
for
while
adultery
was
punished
in
the
severe
manner
described
incest
was
not
only
permitted
but
commonly
practiced
and
it
was
even
the
custom
for
relations
to
marry
within
the
closest
degrees
of
consanguinity
but
they
were
not
long
located
in
england
before
the
more
savage
traits
of
their
character
were
softened
down
and
the
women
soon
found
amusement
more
suitable
to
their
sex
than
that
of
chasing
their
erring
sisters
as
quarry
the
marriage
ceremonies
also
assumed
a
more
refined
and
decent
character
although
the
wife
continued
to
be
regularly
purchased
by
her
husband
and
the
contract
was
still
considered
a
mere
matter
of
bargain
and
sale
by
the
laws
of
ethelbert
marriageable
women
were
made
commodities
of
barter
and
enactments
of
this
character
are
to
be
found
in
existence
long
subsequent
to
his
reign
as
the
were
a
hardy
vigorous
race
and
existed
chiefly
by
hunting
fishing
and
a
rude
and
imperfect
system
of
agriculture
it
is
not
probable
that
prostitution
existed
among
them
to
any
great
extent
the
fatigues
of
the
chase
and
field
exhausted
the
energy
of
the
body
and
diminished
the
desire
and
capacity
for
sexual
indulgence
and
living
in
small
detached
communities
as
they
did
they
knew
nothing
of
the
stimulating
incentives
of
city
life
yet
that
prostitutes
existed
and
lived
by
the
wages
of
their
profession
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
women
who
were
entitled
by
law
to
hold
and
dispose
of
property
bequeathed
their
wealth
to
their
daughters
with
the
occasional
stipulation
that
they
should
live
chaste
lives
in
the
event
of
their
remaining
single
and
not
earn
money
by
prostituting
their
persons
in
the
reign
of
canute
a
law
was
enacted
by
which
any
one
found
guilty
of
adultery
was
to
be
punished
by
the
loss
of
the
nose
and
the
ears
in
the
course
of
time
the
crime
came
to
be
punished
by
a
fine
paid
to
the
husband
of
the
woman
this
penalty
soon
fell
into
disrepute
as
it
was
found
that
some
husbands
and
wives
took
advantage
of
it
to
extort
fines
from
persons
possessing
more
money
than
prudence
by
a
subsequent
enactment
the
male
adulterer
became
the
property
of
the
king
who
might
send
him
to
the
wars
or
employ
him
at
hard
labor
as
he
pleased
by
a
law
of
edgar
time
the
adulterer
of
either
sex
was
compelled
to
live
for
three
days
in
each
week
on
bread
and
water
for
seven
years
this
was
treating
the
evil
on
physiological
principles
we
can
not
infer
any
very
strict
condition
of
morals
as
the
result
of
this
harsh
legislation
when
punishment
is
carried
to
an
extreme
entirely
disproportioned
to
the
offense
it
is
as
likely
to
fail
in
its
object
as
mistaken
lenity
forgery
and
arson
were
more
frequent
in
england
when
punished
with
death
than
they
are
at
present
and
although
we
have
no
statistics
of
the
time
from
which
we
can
deduce
any
positive
conclusions
we
may
reasonably
imagine
that
neither
the
death
penalty
nor
the
other
barbarous
punishments
substituted
for
it
exercised
any
very
powerful
influence
in
the
diminution
of
the
crime
among
our
hardy
progenitors
it
may
have
taught
them
greater
caution
and
dissimulation
in
the
prosecution
of
their
evil
purposes
but
it
did
not
render
them
the
less
eager
to
profit
by
the
opportunities
thrown
in
their
way
it
has
been
already
shown
that
the
founders
of
christianity
treated
illicit
sexual
indulgence
as
a
sin
and
resorted
to
extreme
measures
for
its
suppression
but
yet
to
some
extent
tolerated
prostitution
shortly
after
he
had
established
himself
in
britain
augustine
put
some
curious
queries
to
the
pope
touching
the
manner
in
which
chastity
among
converts
to
the
new
faith
should
be
enforced
the
nature
of
these
interrogatories
and
replies
forbids
their
appearance
here
that
augustine
required
to
be
instructed
on
such
prurient
details
proves
that
he
was
a
believer
in
the
jewish
observances
of
physical
ablutions
and
cleansing
of
the
person
being
necessary
to
the
removal
of
moral
impurities
and
that
he
carried
his
scrutiny
into
the
morals
of
his
flock
much
farther
than
was
consistent
with
modesty
and
good
sense
however
much
his
religious
teachings
might
have
improved
the
manners
of
the
people
the
regulations
alluded
to
would
have
exercised
no
very
salutary
or
efficacious
influence
over
them
the
lives
of
the
early
kings
and
rulers
of
britain
serve
to
illustrate
the
morals
of
the
nation
during
their
respective
reigns
not
only
by
exhibiting
individual
examples
where
the
condition
of
the
masses
is
hidden
from
view
but
by
affording
us
an
index
to
that
condition
when
it
is
considered
that
the
manners
of
the
court
have
in
all
ages
and
all
countries
exercised
an
important
influence
on
those
of
the
people
augustine
converted
ethelbert
but
his
son
endbald
deserted
the
christian
church
because
it
refused
its
sanction
to
his
becoming
his
wife
it
is
true
that
he
afterward
divorced
her
and
returned
to
christianity
but
in
this
he
was
influenced
rather
by
satiety
than
by
the
promptings
of
a
reviving
faith
many
of
the
other
kings
of
the
heptarchy
were
as
remarkable
for
the
headstrong
ardor
of
their
passion
as
endbald
canulph
of
wessex
had
in
the
year
an
intrigue
with
one
of
his
female
subjects
and
frequently
quitted
his
court
to
enjoy
her
society
in
the
country
during
one
of
these
clandestine
excursions
he
was
surprised
and
surrounded
in
the
night
by
the
followers
of
kynchard
a
rival
pretender
to
the
throne
and
murdered
in
the
arms
of
his
mistress
in
the
ninth
century
prostitution
seems
to
have
been
a
prevailing
vice
throughout
the
country
and
frequent
references
are
made
to
it
in
the
discussions
of
the
period
in
the
arguments
used
in
favor
of
tithes
in
the
time
of
athelstan
it
was
held
by
some
canonists
that
the
clergy
had
a
right
to
demand
one
tenth
of
the
profits
earned
by
prostitutes
in
the
exercise
of
their
calling
it
is
but
right
to
add
that
the
church
did
not
persist
in
enforcing
this
extraordinary
claim
edwy
who
ascended
the
throne
at
the
early
age
of
seventeen
became
involved
in
a
controversy
with
the
monks
on
the
question
then
first
started
of
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
the
celebrated
dunstan
favored
the
new
doctrine
but
edwy
opposed
it
the
youthful
and
inexperienced
prince
was
no
match
for
his
sagacious
antagonist
as
he
soon
after
discovered
on
the
day
of
his
coronation
which
took
place
soon
after
his
marriage
with
his
cousin
elgiva
whom
he
loved
and
resolved
to
wed
though
she
was
within
the
degrees
of
consanguinity
prohibited
by
the
church
his
nobles
were
indulging
in
the
pleasures
of
the
banquet
when
it
was
discovered
that
edwy
had
stolen
away
dunstan
and
odo
archbishop
of
canterbury
conjecturing
the
cause
of
his
absence
proceeded
to
the
private
apartments
of
the
queen
and
found
him
in
her
company
they
tore
him
from
her
and
dragged
him
back
to
the
party
elgiva
face
was
seared
with
a
iron
to
destroy
her
beauty
and
she
was
transported
to
ireland
her
wounds
being
soon
healed
and
all
trace
of
the
injuries
removed
she
returned
to
her
own
country
but
was
met
by
a
party
the
archbishop
had
sent
to
intercept
her
and
put
to
death
thus
professedly
to
preserve
the
morals
of
the
king
these
high
ecclesiastics
committed
crimes
of
far
greater
gravity
than
a
marriage
even
between
persons
more
nearly
related
than
edwy
and
elgiva
edgar
who
succeeded
edwy
was
of
a
still
more
passionate
and
licentious
disposition
he
broke
into
a
convent
and
carried
off
one
of
the
nuns
named
editha
who
was
remarkable
for
her
beauty
in
the
heat
of
passion
he
violated
her
person
and
for
the
double
offense
of
abduction
and
rape
the
church
according
to
the
peculiar
morality
of
the
times
punished
him
by
compelling
him
to
resign
his
crown
for
the
period
of
seven
years
by
a
curious
inconsistency
he
was
permitted
to
retain
possession
of
editha
who
lived
with
him
as
a
concubine
another
of
his
mistresses
he
obtained
by
a
less
violent
process
in
passing
through
andover
he
accidentally
met
the
daughter
of
a
neighboring
noble
who
fascinated
him
by
her
remarkable
beauty
listening
only
to
the
suggestion
of
his
passion
he
proceeded
immediately
to
the
residence
of
the
maiden
mother
and
informing
her
of
the
violent
love
with
which
she
had
inspired
him
demanded
that
she
should
be
permitted
to
share
his
bed
that
night
the
mother
fearing
to
excite
the
king
anger
by
a
refusal
resorted
to
a
stratagem
by
which
she
hoped
to
evade
his
wrath
and
at
the
same
time
preserve
the
chastity
of
her
daughter
she
directed
a
handsome
to
introduce
herself
into
the
young
lady
chamber
and
the
king
was
admitted
after
dark
when
edgar
discovered
the
trick
which
had
been
played
on
him
he
manifested
no
resentment
and
the
accidental
partner
of
his
bed
became
afterward
his
favorite
mistress
these
were
not
his
only
amours
elfrida
daughter
of
the
earl
of
devonshire
was
distinguished
by
extraordinary
beauty
and
the
fame
of
her
charms
reached
the
court
although
she
resided
in
the
country
in
strict
retirement
and
had
never
been
a
mile
from
home
edgar
hearing
of
her
beauty
and
doubting
whether
her
appearance
justified
the
extravagant
praise
lavished
on
it
sent
one
of
his
trusted
favorites
earl
athelwold
to
her
father
residence
to
make
a
report
to
him
on
the
subject
athelwold
himself
like
many
a
similar
envoy
fell
in
love
with
the
young
lady
and
informed
the
king
that
rumor
had
greatly
exaggerated
her
merits
and
that
she
was
positively
ungainly
this
was
sufficient
to
allay
the
king
curiosity
and
athelwold
shortly
afterward
secured
the
young
hand
in
marriage
he
explained
the
matter
to
edgar
by
remarking
that
it
was
her
fortune
which
induced
him
to
overlook
her
homely
features
the
king
desired
him
to
introduce
her
at
court
and
athelwold
persistently
refusing
the
king
suspected
the
true
state
of
the
case
he
intimated
to
the
earl
that
he
had
determined
to
visit
the
castle
where
she
resided
and
the
husband
dreading
the
consequences
implored
his
wife
to
conceal
her
beauty
as
much
as
possible
elfrida
did
precisely
the
contrary
and
set
off
her
charms
by
the
richest
and
most
becoming
toilette
in
her
wardrobe
edgar
was
so
enraged
at
the
deception
practiced
on
him
that
he
put
the
unfortunate
earl
to
death
and
married
the
widow
the
infusion
of
danish
blood
does
not
seem
to
have
exercised
an
improving
influence
on
manners
judging
from
the
following
the
contrary
may
be
inferred
ethelred
kept
a
number
of
danish
troops
in
his
pay
who
were
stationed
in
different
parts
of
the
country
a
complaint
was
made
to
the
king
that
the
danes
had
attained
such
a
pitch
of
refinement
and
made
such
an
advance
in
luxury
that
they
combed
their
hair
daily
and
were
guilty
of
other
acts
of
personal
embellishment
equally
reprehensible
worse
still
it
was
averred
that
the
women
looked
with
favor
on
these
practices
of
the
danes
and
that
the
latter
debauched
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
english
and
disgraced
the
nation
it
is
evident
that
women
who
could
thus
easily
be
led
away
were
only
virtuous
from
the
want
of
opportunity
the
legislation
of
this
period
shows
that
prostitution
was
not
only
tolerated
but
indirectly
encouraged
if
a
man
seduced
the
wife
of
another
he
was
compelled
by
an
early
saxon
law
to
pay
a
fine
to
the
husband
and
to
procure
for
him
another
woman
whom
he
was
to
remunerate
for
admitting
him
to
her
bed
this
was
not
only
offering
a
direct
premium
to
prostitution
by
providing
for
the
debauching
of
a
woman
every
time
another
chose
to
be
seduced
but
it
shows
that
females
were
in
the
habit
of
cohabiting
with
men
for
hire
the
fines
for
adultery
were
graduated
according
to
the
rank
of
the
woman
if
she
happened
to
be
the
wife
of
a
nobleman
her
chastity
was
valued
at
the
moderate
sum
of
six
pounds
sterling
about
thirty
dollars
while
the
wife
of
a
churl
brought
to
her
husband
as
a
salve
for
his
injured
honor
about
a
dollar
and
a
half
the
effect
of
these
enactments
could
not
but
exercise
a
demoralizing
and
injurious
influence
on
the
manners
of
the
people
they
reduced
the
estimate
of
female
chastity
to
that
of
a
cheap
marketable
commodity
whose
loss
could
be
repaid
by
a
small
money
compensation
by
the
laws
of
ethelbert
a
man
was
permitted
to
buy
a
wife
provided
the
purchase
was
made
openly
and
many
such
transactions
are
recorded
the
price
being
sometimes
paid
down
in
money
and
sometimes
in
palfreys
and
other
kinds
of
property
the
practice
however
was
soon
modified
and
it
became
necessary
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
bride
the
husband
was
compelled
to
support
and
protect
her
and
to
treat
her
with
respect
a
couple
desirous
of
contracting
marriage
were
formally
betrothed
in
presence
of
the
priest
and
this
practice
having
something
of
an
ecclesiastical
obligation
without
any
of
its
legal
force
was
frequently
productive
of
the
same
evil
consequences
as
in
norway
at
the
present
day
this
custom
of
betrothal
prevailed
down
to
the
time
of
elizabeth
the
normans
introduced
into
england
if
not
a
higher
standard
of
morals
at
least
a
greater
refinement
in
vice
their
laws
were
moulded
by
the
spirit
of
the
feudal
system
which
they
imported
with
them
under
their
sway
society
was
divided
into
two
classes
feudal
lords
and
their
vassals
the
lord
could
dispose
of
the
person
and
property
of
the
vassal
limited
indeed
by
certain
restrictions
but
still
leaving
so
much
power
in
his
hands
as
to
render
the
latter
a
virtual
slave
thus
by
the
laws
of
the
time
a
vassal
who
seduced
or
debauched
his
lord
wife
or
near
relative
or
who
even
took
improper
liberties
with
them
might
be
punished
by
the
forfeiture
of
his
land
when
a
baron
died
the
estate
escheated
to
the
king
who
took
immediate
possession
and
kept
it
until
the
heir
applied
to
do
homage
for
it
and
pay
such
a
fee
as
the
king
might
demand
if
the
heir
happened
to
be
a
minor
the
king
retained
possession
of
the
estate
until
he
reached
his
majority
and
when
the
inheritance
devolved
on
a
female
the
king
might
give
her
any
husband
he
thought
proper
he
often
turned
this
privilege
to
account
by
selling
the
right
to
the
hand
and
fortune
of
an
heiress
geoffrey
de
mandeville
paid
henry
iii
a
sum
equal
to
about
twenty
thousand
dollars
for
permission
to
wed
isabel
countess
of
gloucester
with
the
right
to
all
her
lands
and
revenues
even
a
male
heir
could
not
select
his
own
bride
except
by
purchasing
permission
from
the
king
otherwise
he
had
to
accept
his
majesty
choice
we
have
no
means
of
estimating
the
amount
of
licentiousness
arising
from
these
arbitrary
regulations
but
we
only
require
a
little
acquaintance
with
human
nature
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
they
must
have
been
a
prolific
source
of
vice
the
husband
being
selected
by
the
king
from
purely
mercenary
or
interested
motives
no
attention
was
of
course
paid
to
disparity
of
ages
or
other
circumstances
on
which
the
purity
of
the
depends
when
the
inclinations
are
forced
in
this
way
women
as
well
as
men
are
apt
to
revenge
themselves
on
their
partners
by
seeking
illicit
enjoyments
mercenary
marriages
when
projected
as
they
are
even
in
our
day
from
sordid
motives
on
the
part
of
parents
or
guardians
almost
invariably
lead
to
infidelity
and
many
an
old
dotard
who
forces
himself
upon
a
girl
under
age
merely
serves
as
a
screen
for
her
clandestine
amours
in
the
reign
of
henry
grave
disputes
occurred
between
the
civil
and
ecclesiastical
courts
on
the
subject
of
bastardy
the
common
law
deemed
all
children
to
be
illegitimate
who
had
been
born
before
marriage
by
the
canon
law
they
were
held
to
be
legitimate
if
the
parents
married
subsequent
to
their
birth
when
a
dispute
of
inheritance
arose
it
was
customary
for
the
civil
to
issue
writs
to
the
spiritual
courts
directing
an
inquiry
to
be
instituted
into
the
legitimacy
of
the
claimants
and
as
the
bishops
always
returned
answers
in
accordance
with
the
canon
law
all
persons
whose
parents
had
married
at
any
period
were
legitimate
when
it
is
considered
how
strongly
most
parents
feel
for
the
honor
of
their
offspring
the
tendency
of
such
decisions
to
increase
prostitution
becomes
apparent
it
may
be
considered
unjust
to
inflict
disabilities
on
the
child
for
the
sins
of
the
parent
but
such
penalties
undoubtedly
have
the
effect
of
imposing
a
check
upon
concubinage
we
have
stated
that
the
king
claimed
the
disposal
of
the
hands
and
fortunes
of
heiresses
the
barons
claimed
a
still
greater
privilege
from
their
tenants
in
some
localities
the
feudal
lord
insisted
upon
enjoying
the
person
of
one
of
the
daughters
of
each
tenant
who
happened
to
be
blessed
with
a
plurality
of
them
he
returned
her
to
her
parents
within
a
given
time
every
extreme
is
followed
by
a
reaction
in
the
opposite
direction
the
abject
condition
of
women
as
indicated
by
the
foregoing
facts
led
to
the
institution
of
chivalry
which
elevated
her
from
the
position
of
a
slave
and
the
mere
instrument
of
sensual
gratification
to
that
almost
of
a
deity
thus
assigning
her
a
rank
as
much
above
her
real
sphere
as
her
former
one
had
been
beneath
it
previous
to
the
advent
of
this
system
women
could
not
appear
at
any
public
exhibition
or
place
of
amusement
unless
accompanied
by
a
band
of
armed
retainers
any
female
encountered
alone
and
unprotected
was
liable
to
insult
chivalry
if
it
did
not
put
an
end
to
greatly
modified
this
state
of
things
by
its
rules
each
of
its
members
was
constituted
a
champion
of
female
virtue
and
honor
no
man
was
admitted
into
the
order
whose
valor
was
not
above
suspicion
and
a
word
uttered
by
him
derogatory
to
the
excluded
him
from
its
ranks
no
woman
however
was
deemed
worthy
of
knightly
protection
who
had
not
preserved
her
honor
it
being
to
that
quality
alone
that
knighthood
volunteered
its
safeguard
at
public
ceremonies
if
a
woman
of
easy
virtue
ventured
to
take
precedence
of
a
woman
of
honorable
fame
she
was
immediately
reminded
of
the
impropriety
of
her
conduct
by
some
member
of
the
order
and
compelled
to
retire
to
the
rear
this
recognition
of
virtue
had
a
strong
tendency
to
promote
female
chastity
it
could
not
put
a
stop
to
voluntary
prostitution
but
it
at
least
prevented
virtuous
women
being
necessitated
to
yield
their
honor
to
force
it
held
out
moreover
an
attractive
premium
to
correct
conduct
among
the
sex
by
making
it
the
object
of
heroic
exploits
celebrated
in
the
romantic
lays
of
minstrels
and
troubadours
its
observances
have
a
fantastic
aspect
in
the
light
of
modern
civilization
but
they
unquestionably
exercised
a
powerful
corrective
influence
over
the
female
character
so
degraded
at
its
commencement
while
at
the
same
time
they
elevated
that
of
the
male
sex
by
teaching
them
to
respect
themselves
in
the
wars
of
the
period
it
was
against
the
rules
of
chivalry
to
take
women
prisoners
when
a
town
was
captured
and
entered
by
victorious
troops
the
first
step
taken
was
to
make
proclamation
that
no
violence
should
be
offered
to
any
female
this
conduct
was
so
much
at
variance
with
the
notions
and
habits
of
soldiery
that
the
feelings
which
sustained
chivalry
must
have
taken
deep
root
in
the
minds
of
all
classes
to
restrain
the
passions
of
the
military
strengthened
as
they
were
by
dissolute
habits
and
the
absence
of
opportunity
for
their
gratification
during
service
in
the
field
to
such
an
extreme
was
this
feeling
of
deferential
courtesy
to
the
sex
carried
that
the
normans
were
severely
censured
for
their
conduct
at
the
capture
of
the
castle
of
du
guesclin
it
being
alleged
that
they
disturbed
the
repose
of
the
ladies
but
as
the
tendency
of
every
human
institution
is
to
degenerate
from
its
original
purpose
the
rigid
purism
which
marked
the
foundation
of
chivalry
soon
began
to
relax
and
disorders
crept
in
and
sapped
the
basis
of
a
system
which
was
too
theoretically
perfect
to
have
any
extended
duration
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
the
precise
character
of
the
relations
which
existed
between
the
troubadours
and
the
mistresses
to
whose
service
they
devoted
themselves
and
who
were
frequently
married
women
the
knight
bertram
happened
to
lose
the
favor
of
his
mistress
the
wife
of
talleyrand
de
perigord
in
consequence
of
stories
which
had
been
related
to
her
implicating
his
fidelity
and
charging
him
with
dividing
his
knightly
attentions
he
protests
his
innocence
of
these
accusations
in
a
lay
as
impassioned
as
that
of
a
lover
to
the
object
of
his
adoration
and
invokes
a
number
of
knightly
calamities
upon
himself
if
his
devotion
to
her
be
not
above
suspicion
it
is
hardly
credible
that
the
loves
of
such
ardent
admirers
was
immaculate
platonism
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
husbands
were
rarely
or
never
jealous
of
them
goes
some
way
to
refute
the
idea
that
they
had
a
more
serious
character
the
lords
of
those
times
were
proud
of
the
protestations
of
regard
offered
to
their
ladies
and
rewarded
the
troubadours
with
rich
and
valuable
presents
the
lords
of
our
day
grown
wise
by
experience
make
a
point
of
keeping
all
such
interlopers
at
a
distance
while
chivalry
poised
its
lance
in
defense
of
the
lucretias
and
then
of
the
dulcineas
of
the
day
the
religious
view
of
the
commerce
of
the
sexes
was
particularly
ascetic
although
the
most
profound
devotion
was
paid
to
woman
in
the
abstract
by
the
order
the
church
sought
to
encourage
perpetual
celibacy
the
seclusion
of
women
and
the
separation
of
the
sexes
the
clergy
were
forbidden
to
marry
and
the
idea
seemed
to
prevail
that
it
was
impossible
for
men
and
women
to
mingle
without
being
under
the
influence
of
lascivious
ideas
and
ready
to
carry
them
into
practice
as
soon
as
opportunity
offered
the
attempt
to
organize
society
on
such
a
basis
had
an
inevitable
tendency
to
produce
demoralization
its
obvious
result
instead
of
promoting
chastity
was
to
increase
secret
licentiousness
and
encourage
prostitution
even
the
voluntary
vows
of
knights
and
troubadours
were
in
the
end
as
little
observed
as
these
ecclesiastical
precepts
the
profligacy
of
the
troubadours
became
open
and
undisguised
and
the
virtue
of
their
mistresses
naturally
kept
pace
with
their
example
the
knights
who
enlisted
in
the
crusades
with
a
large
amount
of
zeal
and
but
a
small
share
of
wealth
supported
their
retainers
by
robberies
on
the
way
and
the
females
who
accompanied
them
acted
as
camp
followers
usually
do
no
institution
which
deals
merely
in
external
observances
can
restrain
immorality
in
circumstances
favorable
to
its
development
and
hence
chivalry
was
forced
to
yield
before
more
powerful
influences
that
it
served
its
purpose
in
elevating
the
condition
of
woman
and
in
giving
a
better
tone
to
society
at
large
it
would
be
unjust
to
deny
even
when
chivalry
declined
and
ceased
to
inspire
feats
of
we
find
women
instead
of
falling
back
into
the
degrading
position
they
had
formerly
occupied
employing
themselves
in
intellectual
pursuits
publishing
books
mixing
in
public
controversies
distinguishing
themselves
in
the
acquisition
of
languages
and
even
taking
a
leading
part
in
the
political
affairs
of
the
times
among
the
women
who
acquired
a
historical
notoriety
by
their
position
as
royal
mistresses
during
the
epoch
comprised
between
the
norman
conquest
and
the
reign
of
henry
were
the
fair
rosamond
concubine
of
henry
and
jane
shore
the
mistress
of
edward
iv
the
misfortunes
as
well
as
the
generous
qualities
of
these
fair
sinners
have
thrown
a
sort
of
halo
around
them
rosamond
surnamed
the
fair
on
account
of
her
exquisite
beauty
was
the
daughter
of
walter
lord
clifford
and
was
educated
in
the
nunnery
of
godstow
the
popular
tradition
concerning
her
is
that
henry
hearing
of
her
charms
paid
her
a
visit
but
finding
her
virtue
inflexible
had
to
exercise
his
authority
as
sovereign
to
compel
her
to
yield
to
his
wishes
he
placed
her
in
a
building
erected
in
the
midst
of
a
labyrinth
at
woodstock
access
to
which
could
only
be
obtained
by
a
clew
of
thread
henry
located
her
here
to
protect
her
from
the
jealousy
of
his
queen
eleanor
she
bore
the
king
two
sons
william
longsword
earl
of
salisbury
and
geoffrey
bishop
of
lincoln
during
the
king
absence
in
france
he
intrusted
the
keeping
of
woodstock
and
the
care
of
the
fair
rosamond
to
one
lord
thomas
who
endeavored
to
seduce
her
in
revenge
for
the
rejection
of
his
overtures
the
faithless
warden
conducted
queen
eleanor
to
her
retreat
and
the
latter
is
said
to
have
mixed
a
cup
of
poison
which
her
minions
compelled
the
unfortunate
rosamond
to
drink
it
is
also
alleged
that
the
queen
struck
the
poor
girl
on
her
lip
with
her
clenched
hand
some
assert
that
rosamond
died
a
natural
death
in
a
convent
at
oxford
and
attribute
the
origin
of
the
story
of
poisoning
to
the
figure
of
a
cup
which
was
sculptured
on
her
tomb
it
is
more
probable
that
this
effigy
was
placed
there
to
commemorate
the
actual
event
rosamond
was
buried
in
the
church
of
godstow
opposite
the
high
altar
where
her
remains
lay
undisturbed
until
they
were
ordered
to
be
removed
with
every
mark
of
indignity
by
hugh
bishop
of
lincoln
in
the
year
she
was
regarded
by
the
people
as
a
saint
if
not
a
martyr
and
wonderful
legends
were
related
concerning
her
jane
shore
the
celebrated
concubine
of
edward
was
the
wife
of
matthew
shore
a
goldsmith
in
lombard
street
london
edward
possessed
a
good
figure
and
pleasing
address
and
was
fond
of
athletic
sports
and
exercises
which
he
enjoyed
in
company
with
the
citizens
among
whom
he
became
exceedingly
popular
his
popularity
extended
to
many
of
the
citizens
wives
and
it
was
not
considered
out
of
the
natural
course
of
things
that
mrs
shore
should
be
removed
from
lombard
street
to
shine
at
court
as
the
royal
favorite
historians
represent
her
as
extremely
beautiful
remarkably
gay
in
temperament
and
of
uncommon
generosity
the
king
it
is
said
was
no
less
charmed
with
her
temper
and
disposition
than
with
her
person
she
never
made
use
of
her
influence
over
him
to
the
prejudice
of
any
one
and
if
she
ever
importuned
him
it
was
in
favor
of
the
unfortunate
after
the
death
of
edward
she
attached
herself
to
lord
hastings
and
when
richard
iii
cut
off
that
nobleman
as
an
obstacle
to
his
schemes
she
was
arrested
as
an
accomplice
on
the
ridiculous
charge
of
witchcraft
this
accusation
however
terminated
in
a
public
penance
with
the
loss
of
whatever
little
property
she
possessed
notwithstanding
the
severities
exercised
against
her
it
is
certain
that
she
was
alive
in
the
reign
of
henry
when
sir
thomas
more
mentions
having
seen
her
poor
and
shriveled
without
the
least
trace
of
her
former
beauty
rowe
in
his
tragedy
of
jane
shore
has
adopted
the
popular
story
related
in
the
old
ballad
of
her
perishing
from
hunger
in
a
ditch
where
shoreditch
now
stands
but
stow
assures
us
that
that
street
was
thus
named
previous
to
the
time
of
jane
shore
the
example
of
none
of
the
english
kings
had
a
greater
influence
in
bringing
the
marriage
tie
into
disrepute
than
that
of
henry
viii
an
effort
has
been
made
by
fronde
in
his
new
history
of
england
to
redeem
the
character
of
this
monarch
from
some
portion
of
the
obloquy
with
which
it
is
covered
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
an
unmitigated
monster
curious
to
say
during
his
youth
and
early
manhood
he
betrayed
no
evidence
of
the
brutal
passions
which
afterward
moved
him
he
was
the
husband
of
catharine
for
seventeen
years
before
his
domestic
conduct
incurred
reproach
at
that
late
period
of
his
career
he
conceived
a
violent
passion
for
anne
boleyn
and
in
order
to
get
her
to
share
his
bed
sought
to
divorce
his
wife
from
this
period
he
seemed
to
become
the
prey
of
a
restless
concupiscence
which
sought
gratification
in
new
objects
of
indulgence
and
his
passion
for
the
women
he
married
and
beheaded
was
as
as
it
was
violent
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
his
marriage
with
anne
boleyn
was
more
than
adulterous
it
is
said
anne
mother
had
been
more
complaisant
to
henry
than
her
duty
to
her
husband
or
the
laws
of
morality
would
have
sanctioned
and
we
have
the
authority
of
bishop
fisher
for
concluding
that
anne
was
the
result
of
this
illicit
connection
and
that
when
the
king
expressed
an
intention
of
marrying
her
lady
boleyn
exhorted
him
to
abandon
his
design
as
anne
was
his
own
daughter
henry
was
not
to
be
deterred
by
an
obstacle
of
this
sort
he
had
great
difficulty
in
procuring
a
divorce
and
in
the
mean
while
he
and
anne
had
become
so
intimate
that
she
began
to
exhibit
proofs
of
the
connection
which
could
not
be
concealed
a
private
marriage
was
resorted
to
considerations
of
state
rendering
it
prudent
to
keep
the
union
secret
catharine
was
divorced
through
the
instrumentality
of
cranmer
but
henry
did
not
long
continue
to
repose
confidence
in
his
new
bride
soon
after
the
marriage
was
made
public
and
she
had
been
formally
inaugurated
as
queen
she
attended
a
at
greenwich
accompanied
by
the
king
and
a
large
concourse
of
spectators
the
king
observed
her
exchange
amorous
signals
with
one
of
the
combatants
who
was
also
one
of
her
paramours
henry
had
entertained
suspicions
of
her
connection
with
this
man
and
this
proof
as
he
regarded
it
of
her
infidelity
aroused
his
jealousy
he
left
the
scene
on
the
instant
and
returned
to
westminster
where
he
issued
orders
to
have
her
immediately
arrested
she
was
thrown
into
prison
and
tried
on
the
joint
charges
of
adultery
and
incest
she
was
accused
of
having
committed
adultery
with
four
separate
members
of
the
king
household
and
of
having
had
incestuous
intercourse
with
her
own
brother
lord
rochford
she
was
tried
found
guilty
and
executed
whether
she
committed
the
entire
criminality
laid
to
her
charge
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
that
the
incidents
of
the
career
just
described
were
in
perfect
unison
with
the
doings
of
henry
and
his
court
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
influence
of
such
examples
on
the
morals
of
the
people
at
large
there
is
unfortunately
as
little
question
if
court
manners
and
court
styles
are
zealously
followed
the
vices
that
spring
from
them
are
not
less
assiduously
improved
upon
henry
strong
sexual
passions
as
well
as
his
arbitrary
disposition
were
bequeathed
to
his
daughter
elizabeth
however
historians
may
differ
as
to
the
degree
of
her
depravity
they
all
agree
that
her
right
to
the
title
of
virgin
queen
was
exceedingly
ill
founded
many
of
her
delinquencies
with
persons
of
the
opposite
sex
were
notorious
although
perhaps
difficult
of
proof
while
she
had
not
the
slightest
claim
to
beauty
she
delighted
in
flattery
and
could
swallow
any
amount
of
gross
and
fulsome
adulation
her
vanity
so
blinded
her
that
she
never
perceived
that
the
extravagant
praises
lavished
on
her
personal
attractions
were
merely
covert
satire
it
is
said
that
elizabeth
indulged
in
almost
indiscriminate
lewdness
and
that
leicester
hatton
essex
mountjoy
and
numerous
others
shared
her
favors
in
one
of
the
notes
appended
to
hume
fourth
volume
the
nature
of
elizabeth
dealings
with
a
large
number
of
her
favorites
is
set
forth
the
author
of
the
statement
being
the
countess
of
shrewsbury
mary
queen
of
scots
at
a
time
when
friendly
relations
existed
between
her
and
elizabeth
wrote
to
the
latter
that
the
countess
had
reported
that
elizabeth
had
given
a
promise
of
marriage
to
a
certain
courtier
but
finding
the
marriage
inexpedient
had
dispensed
with
the
ceremony
and
admitted
him
to
her
bed
the
countess
also
stated
that
she
had
been
equally
indulgent
to
simier
the
french
agent
and
that
hatton
another
of
her
paramours
had
spread
many
reports
indicative
of
her
extreme
sexual
passion
the
immediate
successors
of
elizabeth
were
of
a
different
personal
temperament
and
did
not
abandon
themselves
to
such
scandalous
excesses
james
had
no
mistresses
and
was
not
of
a
character
to
seek
pleasure
in
extravagant
licentiousness
but
his
court
was
not
free
from
the
scenes
which
had
disgraced
those
of
henry
and
elizabeth
james
being
desirous
of
uniting
the
earl
of
essex
with
the
lady
frances
howard
daughter
of
the
earl
of
suffolk
had
the
young
couple
betrothed
although
they
had
not
attained
the
age
of
puberty
the
earl
was
only
fourteen
years
of
age
while
lady
frances
was
but
thirteen
and
it
was
deemed
proper
for
the
youth
to
travel
until
both
should
have
arrived
at
the
maturity
necessary
for
the
consummation
of
the
marriage
relation
after
four
years
spent
on
the
continent
the
earl
returned
to
england
and
found
his
affianced
bride
in
the
full
lustre
of
extraordinary
beauty
and
of
the
fame
which
great
personal
charms
excite
he
had
also
the
mortification
to
find
himself
repulsed
when
he
approached
her
as
a
husband
and
was
met
by
every
manifestation
of
dislike
and
contempt
he
complained
to
her
parents
on
the
subject
and
they
compelled
her
to
accompany
him
to
the
country
although
the
young
countess
obeyed
this
mandate
literally
the
feud
between
her
and
essex
was
far
from
terminated
she
recognized
him
as
her
husband
in
name
only
and
sedulously
kept
herself
aloof
from
his
society
nor
could
any
of
his
endeavors
overcome
her
repugnance
the
lady
persisted
in
her
obstinacy
the
husband
redoubled
his
attentions
and
importunities
but
finding
that
she
was
invincible
he
finally
abandoned
the
pursuit
and
separated
from
her
the
cause
of
this
strange
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
countess
was
the
passion
which
she
entertained
for
a
scotch
adventurer
named
robert
carr
who
had
found
a
favorable
reception
from
the
king
by
whom
he
was
created
viscount
rochester
she
believed
that
by
refusing
to
consummate
her
marriage
with
essex
she
would
not
be
considered
by
the
world
in
the
light
of
his
wife
and
she
hoped
to
procure
a
divorce
which
would
enable
her
to
marry
rochester
as
their
mutual
attachment
was
ardent
and
their
opportunities
for
being
together
frequent
they
anticipated
the
probability
of
a
marriage
and
indulged
their
passions
without
waiting
for
the
ceremony
they
did
not
find
as
much
trouble
in
procuring
a
divorce
as
they
had
anticipated
the
king
who
had
a
strong
partiality
for
rochester
favored
their
views
and
essex
finding
that
his
suit
was
hopeless
with
his
wife
opposed
no
obstacle
to
the
nullification
of
his
marriage
the
grounds
on
which
the
countess
sued
out
the
divorce
were
of
rather
a
curious
character
the
chief
allegation
against
essex
was
impotency
at
that
time
a
firm
faith
existed
in
the
absurd
notions
that
there
were
people
who
possessed
the
power
of
witchcraft
enabling
them
among
other
things
to
deprive
a
man
of
his
virility
it
was
asserted
and
maintained
that
essex
had
been
subjected
to
this
influence
and
was
therefore
incompetent
to
occupy
the
position
of
a
married
man
the
divorce
was
secured
and
rochester
and
the
countess
experienced
no
farther
obstacle
to
the

however
of

they
excised

their

to
the

of

impulses
natural
to
the

breast
in

repress
the
excesses
arising
from

that

are
the
best
safeguard
against
criminal
indulgence
but
the
puritans
thought
otherwise
and
looked
upon
joyous
exhilaration
of
any
kind
as
almost
sinful
they
enforced
their
gloomy
doctrines
with
a
tyranny
as
unbending
as
their
tenets
themselves
were
harsh
and
unnatural
theatrical
entertainments
dancing
were
sternly
placed
under

and
puritanism
presented
merely
a
heavy
and
murky
atmosphere
with
scarcely
a
social
star
to
enliven
its
gloomy
aspect
when
the
restoration
removed
the
oppressive
weight
of
fanaticism
from
the
public
spirit
it
rebounded
as
far
above
a
healthy
pitch
as
it
had
been
formerly
depressed
below
it
an
immediate
revolution
took
place
in
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
people
the
theatres
which
had
been
closed
by
the
puritans
were
at
once
reopened
and
the
populace
abandoned
themselves
to
pleasurable
excesses
with
an
eagerness
proportionate
to
the
restraint
which
had
been
imposed
on
them
this
license
would
in

have
been
checked
by
reflection
had
not
the
impulse
been
supplied
from
the
quarter
where
a
repressive
influence
should
have
been
exercised
the
merry
monarch
and
his
court
led
the
race
in
this
national
carnival
and
the
examples
which
they
set
only
served
to
stimulate
the
public
appetite
for
debauchery
indeed
the
court
of
charles
was
little
better
than
a
public
brothel
and
the
wit
with
which
its
orgies
were
embellished
only
served
to
increase
the
dangers
arising
from
its
conspicuous
position
and
its
power
over
men
minds
as
the
centre
from
which
all
rank
and
consideration
flowed
the
conduct
of
the
courtiers
was
strictly
modeled
on
that
of
their
royal
master
and
their
social
accomplishments
only
imperfectly
varnished
over
the
gross
features
of
a
coarse
sensuality
women
were
flattered
and
caressed
but
not
respected
and
the
homage
paid
them
was
such
as
no
decent
woman
in
our
time
would
consent
to
receive
the
most
faithful
portraiture
of
the
manners
of
this
epoch
is
to
be
found
in
its
dramatic
literature
the
staple
incidents
of
the
pieces
represented
at
the
theatres
consisted
of
love
intrigues
seductions
and
rapes
the
fop
of
the
play
never
elicited
such
hearty
applause
as
when
he
recounted
his
exploits
in
the
ruin
of
female
virtue
among
the
citizens
wives
the
theatre
not
only
fostered
lewdness
by
depicting
it
in
glowing
and
attractive
colors
but
its
actors
spread
abroad
the
corruption
which
it
was
their
business
to
delineate
their
personal
character
corresponded
in
too
many
instances
with
the
parts
which
they
performed
and
they
in
private
the
debaucheries
which
they
presented
on
the
stage
the
theatre
itself
became
a
central
rendezvous
for
immoral
characters
and
the
place
where
assignations
were
most
conveniently
fixed
lively
wenches
under
the
pretense
of
selling
oranges
to
the
spectators
frequented
the
pit
and
took
their
places
in
the
front
row
with
their
backs
to
the
stage
it
was
well
understood
that
they
were
as
ready
to
sell
favors
as
fruit
and
in
fact
that
they
had
come
from
the
neighboring
brothels
for
that
express
purpose
deep
drinking
was
another
characteristic
feature
of
the
times
and
bacchanalian
orgies
were
freely
indulged
in
by
all
classes
from
the
king
to
the
beggar
differing
little
in
the
extremes
to
which
they
were
pushed
conversation
even
in
what
was
called
the
best
society
was
disfigured
by
the
grossest
obscenity
and
blasphemy
and
consisted
in
the
extravagance
to
which
this
vicious
conduct
was
extended
even
the
peasantry
endeavored
to
imitate
the
costumes
and
carriage
of
the
courtiers
and
country
women
were
to
be
seen
in
flaunting
dresses
cut
so
as
to
expose
as
much
as
possible
of
the
person
up
to
this
period
no
female
had
ever
appeared
upon
the
english
stage
where
women
were
introduced
their
parts
had
been
filled
by
boys
neither
was
it
customary
for
a
monarch
to
show
himself
at
a
public
representation
of
a
play
but
when
they
were
enacted
for
his
amusement
the
performance
took
place
in
some
apartment
of
the
royal
palace
in
charles
reign
women
for
the
first
time
appeared
on
the
stage
and
performed
the
parts
allotted
to
the
heroines
of
the
drama
the
king
and
queen
became
regular
frequenters
of
the
theatre
and
encouraged
by
their
presence
the
and
broad
indecencies
of
the
pieces
in
vogue
we
may
remark
parenthetically
that
unmarried
actresses
usually
adopted
the
title
mistress
before
their
names
the
word
miss
as
then
applied
signifying
that
she
who
bore
it
was
a
concubine
in
modern
days
it
is
the
habit
to
reverse
this
practice
as
the
marriage
state
is
considered
to
divest
the
actress
of
half
her
attractions
there
were
but
two
theatres
in
london
at
this
period
the
king
theatre
where
the
celebrated
nell
gwynne
and
rebecca
marshall
were
the
chief
actresses
and
the
duke
where
another
company
performed
one
day
the
reigning
favorites
at
the
king
theatre
had
a
violent
quarrel
and
marshall
called
nell
lord
buckhurst
mistress
nell
contented
herself
with
rejoining
that
she
was
but
one
man
mistress
though
brought
up
in
a
brothel
while
marshall
bore
the
same
relation
to
three
or
four
notwithstanding
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
presbyterian
their
own
accounts
of
each
other
leave
no
doubt
as
to
their
morality
the
pieces
represented
in
the
london
theatres
in
the
time
of
charles
ii
were
as
we
have
before
stated
filled
with
indecent
allusions
and
their
interest
with
the
public
turned
on
the
number
and
intensity
of
these
prurient
passages
the
ladies
never
attended
the
first
representation
of
a
comedy
except
in
masks
and
when
the
dames
of
the
court
with
their
established
reputations
for
gallantry
were
apprehensive
of
being
seen
at
them
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
licentious
character
of
the
pieces
most
in
favor
but
many
of
these
plays
are
still
in
evidence
to
speak
for
themselves
it
will
be
seen
that
in
the
majority
the
plot
is
so
framed
as
to
admit
the
greatest
license
in
libidinous
allusions
the
distinguishing
feature
of
them
is
that
the
most
immodest
passages
are
put
into
the
mouths
of
women
and
indeed
we
know
that
that
actress
was
the
most
successful
who
took
the
greatest
liberties
with
the
text
and
most
improved
upon
its
lewdness
of
expression
as
a
specimen
of
the
general
character
of
these
plays
we
may
name
all
mistaken
or
the
mad
couple
quite
a
favorite
with
the
public
in
its
day
the
hero
is
importuned
by
six
clamorous
unfortunates
whose
ruin
he
has
effected
and
dunned
in
addition
by
the
nurses
of
their
illegitimate
offspring
for
wages
owing
to
them
the
delectable
superstructure
of
obscene
dialogue
which
is
raised
on
this
foundation
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
the
usual
hour
at
which
the
theatres
opened
their
doors
was
four
in
the
afternoon
and
after
the
close
of
the
performances
the
audience
generally
repaired
to
some
garden
or
other
place
of
public
amusement
here
scenes
were
enacted
which
proved
a
fit
sequel
to
those
witnessed
on
the
stage
the
had
a
superior
known
as
orange
moll
who
occupied
a
position
somewhat
analogous
to
that
of
the
modern
she
attended
the
girls
to
the
theatre
and
superintended
and
directed
their
operations
there
during
the
lewd
conversations
were
carried
on
between
the
and
the
gallants
which
were
interspersed
with
obscene
jokes
and
highly
relished
by
the
audience
the
custom
of
interpellating
the
gay
women
who
frequented
the
theatre
was
continued
to
a
period
comparatively
recent
every
one
has
heard
the
story
of
peg
plunket
and
the
duke
of
rutland
in
the
days
when
the
gods
of
the
dublin
theatre
were
esteemed
the
most
discriminating
though
boisterous
and
rollicking
audience
of
the
three
kingdoms
charles
selected
several
of
his
mistresses
from
the
stage
for
which
he
had
a
passionate
fondness
miss
davis
literally
sang
and
danced
her
way
into
his
affections
her
conquest
of
the
king
was
consummated
by
the
manner
in
which
she
sang
the
popular
ballad
my
lodging
is
on
the
cold
ground
charles
thought
she
was
deserving
of
warmer
quarters
and
raised
her
to
his
own
bed
he
established
her
in
a
splendid
residence
and
lavished
on
her
the
most
extravagant
gifts
the
queen
at
first
resented
the
open
and
undisguised
infidelities
of
the
king
and
publicly
manifested
her
sense
of
them
on
one
occasion
by
quitting
the
theatre
when
miss
davis
made
her
appearance
on
the
stage
but
finding
it
impossible
to
reclaim
him
from
his
vicious
propensities
she
abandoned
all
hopes
of
restricting
his
libertinism
or
even
of
keeping
him
within
the
bounds
of
conventional
decency
the
countess
of
castlemaine
afterward
created
duchess
of
cleveland
was
of
a
more
jealous
temperament
than
the
queen
and
took
a
more
characteristic
revenge
on
charles
for
his
frailties
she
took
another
lover
and
went
to
reside
at
his
house
very
much
to
the
comfort
of
her
royal
patron
who
had
a
kingly
dislike
of
trouble
after
quarreling
with
lord
buckhurst
nell
gwynne
returned
to
the
stage
but
had
not
long
resumed
her
profession
when
it
was
rumored
that
she
had
made
a
conquest
of
the
king
these
reports
were
apparently
contradicted
by
her
continued
appearance
at
the
theatre
and
the
progress
she
made
in
her
art
which
could
only
be
the
result
of
careful
study
a
tragedy
by
dryden
was
advertised
the
principal
character
to
be
performed
by
nell
but
before
the
night
of
its
first
representation
arrived
it
was
found
necessary
to
postpone
the
performance
owing
to
nell
not
being
in
a
condition
to
appear
from
this
time
her
connection
with
charles
no
longer
remained
a
secret
nell
like
her
predecessors
was
not
long
suffered
to
maintain
uncontested
her
supremacy
over
the
king
affections
when
the
duchesse
the
sister
of
charles
paid
a
visit
to
the
english
court
in
she
had
in
her
train
a
handsome
maid
who
was
admired
for
her
simple
and
childish
style
of
beauty
whether
instigated
by
the
courtiers
who
accompanied
her
mistress
whose
visit
was
a
political
one
or
prompted
by
her
own
sagacity
she
made
her
acquiescence
in
the
king
desires
conditional
upon
his
executing
the
shameful
treaty
which
gave
france
such
important
advantages
and
rendered
charles
a
mere
tributary
to
the
french
king
this
girl
louise
de
querouaille
became
the
rival
of
nell
gwynne
and
had
a
child
by
charles
who
was
created
duke
of
richmond
so
scandalously
public
had
the
relations
of
charles
with
the
loose
women
who
surrounded
him
become
and
so
flagrant
and
unblushing
was
the
conduct
of
the
latter
that
the
queen
could
no
longer
reside
in
the
palace
of
whitehall
and
accordingly
removed
to
somerset
house
in
the
strand
this
feeling
of
indignation
on
the
part
of
her
majesty
soon
extended
to
the
virtuously
disposed
part
of
the
public
efforts
were
made
to
apply
a
remedy
to
the
disorder
which
threatened
to
corrupt
the
whole
framework
of
english
society
in
parliament
it
was
proposed
to
levy
a
tax
on
the
which
had
become
undisguised
nests
of
prostitution
the
debate
which
ensued
elicited
a
witticism
which
led
to
serious
consequences
to
the
gentleman
who
uttered
it
on
sir
john
birkenhead
remarking
that
the
players
were
the
king
servants
and
part
of
his
pleasures
sir
john
coventry
was
imprudent
enough
to
inquire
whether
the
king
pleasures
lay
among
the
men
that
acted
or
the
women
for
this
offense
to
charles
he
was
waylaid
by
some
of
the
courtiers
who
slit
his
nose
and
otherwise
maltreated
him
it
is
impossible
however
to
deny
that
this
very
license
of
manners
rendered
the
king
popular
with
a
certain
class
of
his
subjects
the
only
exception
taken
by
them
to
his
conduct
was
the
selection
of
a
foreigner
as
one
of
his
mistresses
and
even
this
would
have
passed
without
comment
but
for
the
political
consequences
of
the
connection
it
was
generally
understood
among
the
people
that
mademoiselle
de
querouaille
or
carwell
as
she
was
commonly
called
was
an
agent
used
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
ascendency
of
french
interests
this
brought
upon
her
the
hostility
of
the
populace
who
availed
themselves
of
every
opportunity
of
manifesting
their
dislike
to
her
nell
gwynne
was
an
english
woman
a
protestant
and
the
idol
of
the
town
she
was
known
by
the
title
of
the
protestant
mistress
while
carwell
went
by

king
popish
concubine
nell
was
one
day
insulted
in
her
carriage
at
oxford
and
came
very
near
being
mobbed
by
the
populace
in
mistake
for
carwell
with
her
usual
wit
and
presence
of
mind
she
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
quieted
the
rioters
by
telling
them
that
she
was
the
protestant
w
as
the
literature
of
the
times
reflected
the
general
licentiousness
of
manners
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
arts
would
escape
their
demoralizing
influence
most
of
the
paintings
then
executed
were
characterized
by
the
same
freedom
of
expression
which
was
used
on
the
stage
there
is
an
old
print
extant
of
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
reclining
on
a
bank
of
violets
wearing
no
other
covering
than
a
lace
robe
and
in
another
nell
gwynne
is
represented
in
the
same
condition
it
is
said
that
this
dress
had
belonged
to
the
duchess
and
had
been
much
admired
by
the
king
but
that
with
her
usual
love
of
mischief
nell
had
purloined
it
greatly
to
the
amusement
of
her
royal
lover
and
very
much
to
the
chagrin
and
mortification
of
the
duchess
the
king
had
his
own
peculiar
way
of
celebrating
the
sabbath
on
that
day
he
usually
collected
his
mistresses
around
him
and
amused
himself
by
toying
with
them
and
humoring
their
caprices
we
have
a
picture
by
a
contemporaneous
writer
of
one
of
his
sunday
evenings
at
whitehall
where
the
court
resided
it
was
shortly
before
his
death
charles
sat
in
the
centre
of
a
group
of
these
women
indulging
in
the
most
frivolous
amusements
and
apparently
in
high
humor
at
a
little
distance
stood
a
page
singing
for
the
delectation
of
the
king
mistresses
while
round
a
were
seated
a
number
of
his
courtiers
playing
for
stakes
which
sometimes
ran
as
high
as
ten
thousand
dollars
of
our
money
the
orgies
of
the
night
were
kept
up
until
daylight
broke
in
upon
the
revelers
at
eight
the
same
morning
the
king
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
apoplexy
and
died
within
a
week
james
though
of
a
grave
and
stern
character
was
scarcely
less
amorous
in
his
temperament
than
charles
they
differed
however
in
their
tastes
charles
required
beauty
in
his
mistresses
and
nell
gwynne
and
some
of
his
other
concubines
were
not
only
beautiful
in
person
but
possessed
of
intellectual
graces
which
gilded
their
gross
sensuality
james
cared
but
little
for
personal
attractions
and
lavished
his
favors
on
and
women
his
wife
was
below
him
in
rank
and
he
did
not
stoop
to
her
for
her
beauty
for
she
was
plain
if
not
downright
ugly
in
her
features
he
soon
transferred
his
affections
to
a
still
plainer
mistress
arabella
churchill
his
strongest
attachment
was
however
that
which
he
entertained
for
catharine
sedley
who
possessed
a
powerful
influence
over
him
she
was
the
daughter
of
sir
charles
sedley
and
seems
to
have
inherited
from
him
the
strong
passions
and
reckless
disregard
of
public
opinion
by
which
he
was
distinguished
sedley
writings
were
more
licentious
than
those
of
any
of
his
contemporaries
his
literary
talents
were
not
of
a
high
order
but
he
possessed
fair
conversational
abilities
which
made
his
society
attractive
the
extreme
dissoluteness
of
his
life
and
disregard
of
all
decency
provoked
censure
even
in
that
age
of
loose
morals
on
one
occasion
after
a
drunken
revel
with
some
of
his
profligate
companions
he
presented
himself
on
the
balcony
of
a
tavern
near
covent
garden
in
a
state
of
complete
nudity
and
commenced
a
harangue
so
full
of
lewdness
and
obscenity
that
the
crowd
pelted
him
with
stones
and
other
missiles
and
compelled
him
to
withdraw
into
the
house
a
daughter
inheriting
these
propensities
and
brought
up
under
the
influence
of
this
example
could
not
fail
to
become
conspicuous
for
similar
traits
of
character
her
person
possessed
none
of
the
attributes
which
render
women
attractive
a
lank
spare
figure
a
hollow
cheek
sallow
face
and
an
eye
of
glaring
brightness
comprised
the
sum
total
of
her
charms
charles
whose
taste
was
more
cultivated
remarked
that
his
confessor
must
have
recommended
catharine
to
his
brother
as
a
penance
for
his
sins
she
herself
had
the
discrimination
not
to
be
insensible
to
the
truth
of
this
remark
and
was
even
in
the
habit
of
boasting
of
her
own
plain
looks
her
taste
for
finery
was
as
great
as
if
she
possessed
attractions
worth
setting
off
by
its
aid
james
when
he
formed
this
connection
had
advanced
to
middle
age
and
it
is
difficult
to
account
for
the
influence
which
she
contrived
to
exercise
over
him
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
he
promised
the
queen
to
abandon
her
but
his
good
resolutions
soon
gave
way
whenever
the
absence
of
his
wife
afforded
the
opportunity
chiffinch
might
be
seen
conducting
catharine
through
the
private
passage
leading
to
his
chamber
notwithstanding
all
the
affected
austerity
of
his
manners
james
was
in
reality
but
little
better
than
his
volatile
brother
at
no
period
in
the
history
of
england
as
we
have
just
shown
had
the
licentiousness
of
the
court
been
greater
than
it
was
during
the
reigns
of
charles
ii
and
james
ii
only
to
be
exceeded
perhaps
by
the
fearful
abyss
of
debauchery
and
atheism
which
a
few
years
later
was
beheld
in
the
courts
of
louis
xv
and
the
regent
of
france
the
vigor
and
intellect
of
the
early
part
of
the
reign
of
louis
the
magnificence
of
his
tastes
and
the
glory
of
his
enterprises
stand
out
in
powerful
contrast
to
the
doings
of
the
imbecile
corrupt
and
utterly
profligate
and
debased
court
of
england
the
influence
of
this
most
pernicious
example
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
arrive
at
the
great
body
of
the
people
especially
in
the
country
in
those
times
of
difficult
communication
were
probably
but
little
affected
by
the
extravagance
of
the
restored
cavaliers
added
to
which
there
was
a
powerful
leaven
of
religious
feeling
working
through
the
country
which
did
not
for
some
time
settle
down
into
the
apathy
that
called
for
a
new
manifestation
of
puritan
feeling
in
the
establishment
of
wesleyan
methodism
in
the
upper
classes
of
society
however
the
of
the
courts
of
charles
and
james
was
yet
felt
throughout
the
reigns
of
the
succeeding
sovereigns
even
down
to
the
time
of
george
iii
the
writings
of
contemporary
authors
especially
of
the
comic
dramatists
the
abstract
and
brief
chronicles
of
the
times
are
a
fair
type
of
the
public
morals
and
intelligence
in
all
ages
at
this
epoch
we
have
from
these
sources
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
reaction
which
had
taken
place
after
the
removal
of
the
compulsory
restraint
of
puritan
control
the
nation
seemed
at
once
to
have
lost
its
reason
modesty
and
decency
were
badges
of
puritan
republicanism
and
therefore
unsuited
to
loyal
men
who
showed
their
attachment
to
the
monarchy
by
their
abandonment
of
decorum
and
violation
of
every
moral
virtue
the
productions
of
the
favorite
authors
teem
with
coarse
images
unequivocal
allusions
and
gross
facts
wit
degenerated
into
blasphemy
liveliness
into
obscenity
metaphors
into
lasciviousness
the
scenes
that
took
place
in
the
court
and
which
constituted
its
daily
amusements
were
disgusting
to
the
last
degree
the
mere
commerce
of
the
sexes
and
the
libertinism
of
the
period
in
that
respect
were
the
smallest
vices
and
might
almost
be
considered
merely
follies
but
the
venality
and
corruption
were
open
and
shameless
the
courtiers
cast
aside
the
last
rag
of
patriotic
propriety
and
avarice
cruelty
lust
and
perjury
filled
the
measure
of
wickedness
on
one
occasion
it
is
said
an
infant
was
prematurely
born
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
palace
and
charles
with
many
jocular
remarks
had
the
body
conveyed
to
his
own
closet
for
dissection
by
his
own
hand
an
incident
of
such
brutality
which
might
be
frequently
paralleled
by
others
equally
bad
in
degree
though
different
in
fact
shows
the
hideous
destitution
of
all
decency
with
which
the
court
must
have
been
cursed
the
pages
of
rochester
etherege
buckingham
congreve
vanburgh
and
fletcher
in
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
and
prior
gay
swift
and
scores
of
inferior
writers
in
the
commencement
of
the
eighteenth
century
all
exhibit
this
state
of
affairs
while
the
noble
muse
even
of
a
dryden
could
stoop
to
earn
base
applause
by
lending
her
powers
to
the
decoration
of
vice
and
voluntarily
quitting
her
native
regions
to
wallow
in
the
mire
the
vices
of
this
period
must
have
left
an
ineradicable
taint
behind
them
when
after
the
full
tide
of
iniquity
had
swept
on
and
purer
waters
were
succeeding
we
find
lord
chesterfield
a
british
statesman
of
distinguished
ability
and
high
position
thus
advising
his
own
son
let
the
great
book
of
the
world
be
your
principal
study
versate
manu
versate
which
may
be
rendered
thus
turn
over
men
by
day
and
women
by
night
i
mean
only
the
best
editions
while
as
we
have
already
observed
there
was
probably
a
wholesome
religious
element
in
a
portion
of
the
population
which
operated
as
an
antiseptic
against
the
rottenness
of
the
court
it
is
impossible
but
that
the
capital
must
have
been
imbued
with
the
reckless
iniquity
outrageous
dissoluteness
and
general
immorality
of
the
higher
classes
the
poets
playwrights
essayists
and
biographers
of
the
age
all
bear
traces
of
the
effects
of
bad
example
in
high
places
on
public
manners
a
critic
of
those
days
says
the
accomplished
gentleman
of
the
english
stage
is
a
person
that
is
familiar
with
other
men
wives
and
indifferent
to
his
own
and
the
fine
lady
is
generally
a
composition
of
sprightliness
and
falsehood
a
thorough
disrespect
for
female
virtue
or
rather
the
admiration
of
libertinism
tainted
the
life
blood
of
the
capital
and
when
passing
over
the
coarse
wit
of
prior
or
the
perverted
genius
of
dryden
we
come
to
the
sober
and
moderate
writings
of
essayists
and
satirists
we
find
material
which
gives
us
some
little
insight
into
the
lower
london
life
of
the
period
and
that
which
has
more
immediate
interest
for
us
in
this
inquiry
in
the
delightful
and
ever
youthful
pages
of
the
spectator
there
are
some
incidents
of
great
pathos
touching
the
state
of
those
unfortunates
whose
condition
was
then
as
now
one
of
the
disgraces
of
civilization
one
paper
contains
a
singularly
apposite
remark
i
was
told
says
the
writer
a
woman
of
the
town
by
a
roman
catholic
gentleman
last
week
who
i
hope
is
absolved
for
what
then
passed
between
us
that
in
countries
where
popery
prevails
besides
the
advantages
of
licensed
stews
there
are
larger
endowments
given
for
the
i
think
he
called
them
this
manner
of
treating
poor
sinners
has
we
think
great
humanity
in
it
and
as
you
spectator
are
a
person
who
pretends
to
carry
your
reflections
upon
all
subjects
which
occur
to
you
i
beg
therefore
of
you
to
lay
before
the
world
the
condition
of
us
poor
vagrants
who
are
really
in
a
way
of
labor
instead
of
idleness
at
another
time
the
spectator
himself
meets
a
slim
young
girl
of
about
seventeen
who
with
a
pert
air
asked
me
if
i
was
for
a
pint
of
wine
i
could
observe
as
exact
features
as
ever
i
had
seen
the
whole
person
in
a
word
of
a
woman
exquisitely
beautiful
she
affected
to
allure
me
with
a
forced
wantonness
in
her
look
and
air
but
i
saw
it
checked
with
hunger
and
cold
her
eyes
were
wan
and
eager
her
dress
thin
and
tawdry
her
mien
genteel
and
childish
this
strange
figure
gave
me
much
anguish
of
heart
and
to
avoid
being
seen
with
her
i
went
away
but
could
not
avoid
giving
her
a
crown
the
poor
thing
sighed
courtesied
and
with
a
blessing
expressed
with
the
utmost
vehemence
turned
from
me
this
creature
is
what
they
call
come
upon
the
the
arts
of
the
procuresses
their
experiments
on
inexperienced
country
girls
their
attendance
at
and
public
places
to
hunt
for
and
entrap
the
unwary
the
regular
customers
they
have
for
new
wares
the
mode
first
of
offering
them
to
private
sale
and
when
the
first
gloss
is
worn
off
casting
them
on
the
public
market
are
all
as
true
of
as
of
the
day
for
which
it
was
written
in
one
case
the
spectator
being
at
a
overhears
a
lady
inquiring
of
a
young
girl
her
parentage
and
character
and
especially
if
she
has
been
properly
brought
up
and
has
been
taught
her
catechism
desirous
of
seeing
a
lady
who
had
so
proper
an
idea

to

peeps
through
and
sees
the
face
of
a
bawd
thus
decoying
a
young
girl
just
arrived
in
london
one
amusing
cheat
in
the
business
of
these
is
complained
of
by
a

a
consideration
they
profess
to
introduce
some
ambitious

off

of
his

to
the
great
injury
of

it
was
reserved
for

respectable
the

exercised
but
a
negative
influence
on
their
subjects
they
were
merely
viewed
as
political
necessities

no

decidedly

no

in
some
degree
fashionable
the
slough
of
libertinism
in
which
louis
xv
and
the
regent
orleans
had
plunged
themselves
seemed
in
france
to
have
created
some
reaction
louis
xvi
in
paris
and
george
iii
in
london
presented
the
rare
spectacle
to
their
respective
subjects
of
two
men
whose
domestic
life
and
character
were
unimpeachable
but
as
the
sons
of
george
especially
the
prince
of
wales
and
the
duke
of
york
attained
their
majority
they
were
surrounded
by
bands
of
flatterers
and
parasites
who
stimulated
and
encouraged
the
natural
proneness
of
youth
to
pleasure
and
dissipation
the
libertinism
and
excesses
of
the
stuarts
again
became
devoid
it
is
true
of
political
debasement
and
national
dishonor
checked
also
by
parental
disapprobation
and
by
the
influence
of
public
opinion
this
though
very
weak
was
not
quite
powerless
and
though
lenient
to
the
errors
of
youth
it
drew
an
unfavorable
comparison
between
the
reckless
extravagance
and
dissolute
tastes
of
the
princes
and
the
moderate
and
personally
estimable
conduct
of
the
king
and
queen
the
masses
of
the
english
people
were
distinguished
for
plain
good
sense
and
attachment
to
the
cause
of
religion
and
morality
and
although
drinking
gambling
boxing
and
racing
were
in
honor
of
the
royal
princes
fashionable
amusements
and
their
attainment
coveted
and
emulated
by
many
of
the
rising
generation
still
the
general
sentiment
of
the
nation
at
this
period
was
condemnatory
of
these
vices
those
inclined
to
charitable
views
of
human
nature
found
excuses
in
the
temptations
of
youth
a
fine
person
a
commanding
position
and
lastly
in
the
infamous
counsels
of
those
who
found
political
capital
in
the
encouragement
of
these
excesses
thereby
promoting
a
division
between
the
heir
to
the
throne
and
his
sovereign
parent
others
there
were
who
beheld
in
george
whether
as
prince
or
monarch
a
modern
tiberius
a
man
of
ungovernable
lusts
a
ruthless
libertine
and
a
debased
sensualist
without
any
redeeming
qualities
as
a
fact
apart
from
causes
and
political
prejudices
george
iv
was
undoubtedly
a
debauchee
and
a
man
of
dissolute
habits
but
he
was
a
man
of
liberal
education
of
cultivated
taste
of
distinguished
appearance
and
elegant
manners
he
and
the
count
brother
of
louis
were
considered
the
most
finished
gentlemen
in
europe
so
far
as
mannerism
went
these
externals
glossed
over
and
even
lent
a
charm
to
the
vices
of
his
youth
and
the
mysterious
orgies
of
carlton
house
were
associated
in
the
public
mind
with
the
brilliant
wit
of
sheridan
the
manly
grace
of
wyndham
that
of
an
english
gentleman
the
vast
talent
of
fox
and
the
enchanting
grace
of
georgiana
duchess
of
devonshire
the
bright
particular
star
amid
a
galaxy
of
minor
luminaries
the
respectability
belonged
to
the
court
party
the
genius
and
fascination
were
ranged
on
the
side
of
the
prince
of
wales
it
is
difficult
even
at
this
brief
lapse
of
time
and
when
so
many
are
yet
surviving
to
speak
with
any
degree
of
confidence
of
the
state
of
general
public
morals
in
england
as
affected
by
the
french
revolution
and
the
violent
tory
and
whig
contests
of
the
period
the
literature
which
preceded
and
accompanied
the
french
revolution
went
the
whole
length
of
undermining
and
unsettling
every
established
institution
both
of
politics
and
religion
without
building
up
an
effective
substitute
in
place
of
the
structure
destroyed
the
doctrines
of
moral
obligation
and
the
balance
of
general
convenience
which
according
to
the
volney
voltaire
and
rousseau
school
were
to
supersede
the
effete
and
dogmas
of
the
gospel
were
little
known
and
less
liked
in
england
at
the
outset
of
the
french
movements
the
cause
had
the
sympathy
of
the
english
liberals
but
afterward
when
the
social
and
political
excesses
of
the
time
disgusted
even
its
moderate
british
supporters
and
when
the
and
apparently
innate
antagonism
of
the
two
nations
was
revived
by
the
war
the
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
english
people
for
french
manners
french
literature
french
men
french
every
thing
knew
no
bounds
thus
while
the
leaven
of
parisian
philosophy
was
fermenting
in
the
breasts
of
all
continental
europe
it
is
our
opinion
that
its
influence
in
england
was
purely
of
a
reactionary
character
and
as
under
the
last
stuarts
patriotism
and
libertinism
went
hand
in
hand
so
in
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
and
the
commencement
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
an
englishman
love
of
his
own
country
and
his
hatred
of
france
were
associated
with
a
detestation
of
the
heresies
of
french
philosophers
and
patriarchs
of
the
effect
produced
on
the
morals
of
the
people
by
the
loose
manner
in
which
previous
to
the
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
we
have
the
evidence
brought
forward
in
the
debates
on
lord
hardwicke
marriage
bill
anterior
to
that
time
a
boy
of
fourteen
and
a
girl
of
twelve
years
of
age
might
marry
against
the
will
of
their
parents
or
guardians
without
any
possibility
of
dissolving
such
marriage
the
law
indeed
required
the
publication
of
banns
but
custom
and
the
dispensing
power
had
rendered
them
nugatory
a
dispensation
could
be
purchased
for
a
couple
of
crowns
and
the
marriage
could
take
place
in
a
closet
or
a
tavern
before
two
friends
who
acted
as
witnesses
but
dispensations
were
not
always
necessary
there
were
privileged
places
such
as
may
fair
and
the
fleet
where
the
marriage
ceremony
could
be
performed
at
a
moment
notice
and
without
any
inconvenient
questions
being
asked
gretna
green
on
the
borders
of
scotland
was
long
a
famous
place
for
runaway
matches
it
has
been
questioned
how
far
the
scotch
law
of
marriage
was
conducive
to
morality
but
judging
from
its
effects
upon
the
people
themselves
it
can
scarcely
be
considered
an
ally
of
vice
this
law
which
has
only
been
repealed
within
a
few
years
treated
marriage
as
a
civil
contract
valid
if
contracted
before
witnesses
and
required
no
ceremony
or
preparatory
notice
that
unions
so
formed
were
binding
admits
of
no
possible
dispute
the
question
has
been
tried
in
the
british
courts
of
law
on
every
conceivable
ground
and
their
legality
has
been
always
affirmed
but
in
the
case
of
marriages
at
may
fair
or
the
fleet
the
same
certainty
did
not
exist
gretna
green
is
the
first
village
after
passing
the
dividing
line
between
england
and
scotland
and
owes
its
fame
to
its
locality
it
has
doubtless
been
the
scene
of
many
heartless
adventures
for
which
the
actual
law
of
the
land
must
be
held
accountable
the
marriage
act
which
came
into
operation
in
had
for
its
object
the
prevention
of
clandestine
marriages
in
england
but
did
not
interfere
with
the
law
of
scotland
it
sought
to
effect
this
reform
by
making
it
necessary
to
the
validity
of
a
marriage
without
license
that
it
should
take
place
after
the
proclamation
of
banns
on
three
sundays
in
the
parish
church
before
a
person
in
orders
between
single
persons
consenting
of
sound
mind
and
of
the

of

or
of
the
age
of
fourteen

and
twelve

the
consent
of

and

without
their
consent

but
while
the

are
observed
the
omission
is
but
a
veiling
of
the
subject
the
reality
exists
though
unseen
in
the
london
of
july
an
incident
is
thus
related
by
a
correspondent
i
was
standing
on
a
railway
platform
at
with
a
friend
waiting
for
a
train
when
two
ladies
came
into
the
station
i
was
acquainted
with
one
of
them
the
younger
well
she
told
me
she
was
going
to
london
having
been
fortunate
enough
to
get
a
liberal
engagement
as
governess
in
the
family
of
the
lady
under
whose
charge
she
then
was
and
who
had
even
taken
the
trouble
to
come
into
the
country
to
see
her
and
her
friends
to
ascertain
that
was
likely
in
all
respects
to
the
train
coming
in
sight
the
fares
were
paid
the
elder
lady
paying
both
i
saw
them
into
the
carriage
and
the
door
being
closed
i
bowed
to
them
and
rejoined
my
friend
who
happened
to
be
a
london
man
about
town
i
will
say
said
he
with
a
laugh
country
gentlemen
are
pretty
independent
of
public
opinion
you
are
not
ashamed
of
your
little
transactions
being
known
do
you
mean
i
asked
i
mean
your
talking
to
that
girl
and
her
duenna
on
an
open
platform
that
is
miss
an
intimate
friend
of
ours
then
i
can
tell
you
said
the
londoner
to
me
coolly
friend
is
madam
one
of
the
most
noted
procuresses
in
london
and
she
has
got
hold
of
a
new
victim
if
she
is
a
victim
and
no
mistake
i
saw
there
was
not
a
minute
to
lose
i
rushed
to
the
guard
of
the
train
and
got
him
to
wait
a
moment
i
then
hurried
to
the
where
the
ladies
were
you
must
get
out
that
person
is
an
unfit
companion
for
you
madam
we
know
who
you
are
that
was
one
victim
rescued
but
how
many
are
lost
in
another
case
the
practices
of
a
scoundrel
named
phinn
were
made
the
subject
of
a
public
warning
by
the
lord
mayor
of
london
from
his
judicial
chair
this
fellow
plan
was
to
advertise
from
abroad
for
ladies
to
go
to
cologne
or
other
places
on
the
rhine
to
become
governesses
in
his
family
which
was
traveling
and
whose
governess
had
unexpectedly
left
them
or
been
taken
ill
or
was
otherwise
got
rid
of
the
candidates
were
to
pay
their
own
passage
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
when
the
appointments
of
the
situation
were
to
commence
in
some
cases
in
which
the
practices
of
this
rascal
had
failed
of
their
full
effect
he
had
succeeded
in
defrauding
poor
women
of
their
funds
and
they
had
found
the
utmost
difficulty
in
making
their
way
home
again
while
it
is
impossible
to
have
any
precognizance
of
the
persons
and
circumstances
among
which
these
wretches
find
their
prey
some
cases
are
peculiarly
within
the
scope
of
their
operations
young
females
who
have
lost
their
natural
protectors
and
are
brought
into
contact
with
the
world
under
their
own
guidance
are
easily
imposed
upon
by
the
pretended
friendship
of
these
persons
and
being
under
a
pretense
of
employment
inveigled
into
their
houses
are
there
kept
until
their
fall
is
accomplished
by
persuasion
or
force
it
is
said
that
women
even
attend
regularly
at
churches
and
for
the
purpose
of
decoying
female
children
they
first
accost
them
and
interest
them
without
making
any
direct
advances
the
next
time
they
proceed
a
little
farther
and
soon
invite
them
to
accompany
them
a
little
distance
when
they
lead
them
to
a
brothel
they
have
been
known
to
take
the
children
away
in
the
presence
of
the
teacher
who
seeing
them
act
as
acquaintances
had
no
suspicion
of
the
real
nature
of
their
associations
the
london
society
for
the
protection
of
young
females
have
recorded
instances
of
children
of
eleven
years
of
age
being
entrapped
by
procuresses
into
houses
of
prostitution
those
who
are
thus
decoyed
are
not
permitted
to
escape
nor
to
go
into
the
streets
for
two
or
three
months
by
that
time
they
are
supposed
to
be
incapable
of
retracing
their
steps
or
to
have
become
reconciled
to
their
mode
of
life
and
are
permitted
to
go
or
remain
occasionally
they
are
turned
adrift
to
seek
new
lodgings
their
places
being
supplied
by
fresh
arrivals
some
of
these
children
find
their
way
home
again
but
the
majority
of
them
are
of
course
irretrievably
lost
and
continue
in
the
course
into
which
they
have
been
thus
indoctrinated
the
procuresses
have
agents
in
different
parts
of
london
whose
business
it
is
to
discover
young
persons
and
others
who
are
dissatisfied
with
their
earnings
and
condition
in
life
and
who
may
be
considered
suitable
subjects
the
number
of
servants
out
of
place
in
london
alone
is
enormous
many
thousands
in
number
and
as
service
is
no
inheritance
such
a
body
constitutes
a
very
favorable
field
of
operations
the
intermediate
agents
in
these
cases
are
small
laundresses
charwomen
and
such
others
as
from
their
avocations
have
the
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
young
women
in
service
common
too
residing
in
the
suburbs
of
london
contribute
their
quota
of
assistance
young
women
coming
fresh
from
the
country
and
sleeping
in
such
places
for
a
night
receive
recommendations
to
procuresses
and
as
servants
for
hiring
servants
which
in
london
are
called
servants
bazars
and
are
not
under
any
license
are
visited
by
these
people
in
search
of
new
faces
in
some
cases
procuresses
are
found
to
act
on
behalf
of
particular
individuals
only
in
one
case
such
a
woman
kept
a
small
shop
to
which
she
invited
in
the
neighborhood
after
a
little
acquaintance
by
her
assistance
aided
by
liberal
entertainment
with
wines
and
spirits
her
employers
two

enabled

in
a
short
space

a
constant
trade
in
prostitution
is
carried
on
between
london
and
hamburg
london
and
paris
and
london
and
the
country
three
or
four
years
ago
a
trial
took
place
at
the
central
criminal
court
london
of
a
man
and
woman
who
were
engaged
in
the
importation
of
females
for
purposes
of
prostitution
the
prisoners
were
convicted
the
details
of
the
trial
show
that
a
regular
organization
existed
in
some
cases
parisian
prostitutes
were
hired
in
paris
for
the
london
market
by
the
ordinary
agents
in
such
contracts
in
other
cases
the
parties
in
both
capitals
decoyed
young
women
into
their
service
on
pretense
of
reputable
engagements
and
shipped
them
over
to
their
consignees
of
course
every
care
is
taken
in
these
matters
to
keep
the
transaction
confidential
for
although
the
english
laws
are
practically
most
defective
still
in
cases
exciting
any
degree
of
notoriety
and
in
which
the
offense
can
be
satisfactorily
established
by
legal
proof
prosecutions
do
take
place
we
can
not
close
this
branch
of
our
subject
better
than
by
once
again
quoting
from
the
spectator
and
giving
a
genuine
letter
which
although
written
a
century
and
a
half
ago
is
just
such
a
one
as
might
for
a
similar
purpose
be
penned
at
the
present
day
it
as
accurately
describes
the
mode
in
which
articles
of
trade
in
the
procuress
line
are
disposed
of
now
as
then
my
lord
i
having
a
great
esteem
for
your
honor
and
a
better
opinion
of
you
than
of
any
of
the
quality
makes
me
acquaint
you
of
an
affair
that
i
hope
will
oblige
you
to
know
i
have
a
niece
that
came
to
town
about
a
fortnight
ago
her
parents
being
lately
dead
she
came
to
me
expecting
to
have
found
me
in
so
good
a
condition
as
to
set
her
up
in
a
milliner
shop
her
father
gave
fourscore
pounds
with
her
for
five
years
her
time
is
out
and
she
is
not
sixteen
as
pretty
a
gentlewoman
as
ever
you
saw
a
little
woman
which
i
know
your
lordship
likes
and
as
fair
a
complexion
for
red
and
white
as
ever
i
saw
i
doubt
not
but
your
lordship
will
be
of
the
same
opinion
she
designs
to
go
down
about
a
month
hence
except
i
can
provide
for
her
which
i
can
not
at
present
her
father
was
one
with
whom
all
he
had
died
with
him
so
there
is
four
children
left
destitute
so
if
your
lordship
thinks
fit
to
make
an
appointment
where
i
shall
wait
on
you
with
my
niece
by
a
line
or
two
i
stay
for
your
answer
for
i
have
no
place
fitted
up
since
i
left
my
house
fit
to
entertain
your
honor
i
told
her
she
should
go
with
me
to
see
a
gentleman
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
so
i
desire
you
to
take
no
notice
of
my
letter
by
reason
she
is
ignorant
of
the
ways
of
the
town
my
lord
i
desire
if
you
meet
us
to
come
alone
for
upon
my
word
and
honor
you
are
the
first
that
i
ever
mentioned
her
to
next
to
procuresses
in
this
gradation
of
iniquity
are
the
who
although
often
procuresses
are
not
necessarily
so
shakspeare
who
included
all
human
existence
in
the
sphere
of
his
observation
says
of
them
a
bawd
a
wicked
bawd
the
evil
that
thou
causest
to
be
done
that
is
thy
means
to
live
do
thou
but
think
what
is
to
cram
a
maw
or
clothe
a
back
from
such
a
filthy
vice
say
to
thyself
from
their
abominable
and
beastly
touches
i
drink
i
eat
array
myself
and
live
canst
thou
believe
thy
living
is
a
life
so
stinkingly
depending
many
of
these
persons
have
been
prostitutes
themselves
and
when
past
service
in
the
one
branch
of
business
have
naturally
fallen
into
the
other
others
without
having
been
such
adopt
the
trade
from
inclination
or
circumstances
the
condition
of
these
people
and
the
interior
of
their
houses
are
as
various
as
the
people
themselves
at
the
west
end
of
london
there
is
a
considerable
degree
of
style
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
town
they
are
sordid
and
filthy
habitations
fit
only
for
deeds
of
darkness
they
are
confined
to
private
streets
alleys
and
lanes
out
of
the
great
thoroughfares
the
law
is
usually
put
in
operation
in
england
against
the
as
the
representatives
of
the
whole
class
as
they
get
the
chief
profits
of
the
trade
so
they
run
all
the
legal
risks
the
indictments
against
them
however
are
comparatively
few
there
is
no
public
prosecutor
in
england
as
with
us
the
police
administration
of
the
metropolis
perhaps
the
best
organized
the
most
efficient
and
cheapest
department
of
the
public
service
does
not
include
the
prevention
of
brothels
within
its
duties
which
are
confined
to
the
preservation
of
life
and
property
the
prosecution
of
and
abolition
of
their
establishments
are
usually
undertaken
by
the
parish
authorities
when
the
places
are
so
conducted
as
to
become
a
nuisance
to
the
neighborhood
and
police
officers
merely
interfere
to
prevent
the
assemblage
of
prostitutes
in
the
public
streets
or
the
solicitation
of
passengers
by
them
virtually
this
provision
is
little
better
than
a
dead
letter
and
the
women
evade
it
by
walking
when
an
officer
is
in
sight
and
thus
deprive
him
of
the
only
proof
which
would
enable
him
to
make
an
arrest
some
of
the
girls
who
pay
exorbitant
board
also
stipulate
to
give
their
mistresses
one
half
of
their
cash
receipts
which
are
frequently
very
large
in
the
case
of
attractive
women
amounting
sometimes
to
one
or
two
hundred
dollars
a
week
the
mistress
is
treasurer
and
the
prostitutes
rarely
succeed
in
receiving
back
what
ostensibly
belongs
to
them
the
very
prosecution
before
mentioned
originated
in
a
french
girl
being
cheated
by
the
the
clothing
is
furnished
by
the
mistress
and
for
this
she
charges
prices
which
absorb
the
entire
earnings
of
the
girls
she
even
contrives
to
furnish
them
with
such
a
number
of
showy
and
useless
garments
that
she
keeps
them
always
in
her
debt
and
so
has
a
lien
on
each
to
prevent
her
leaving
as
long
as
she
is
a
profitable
member
of
the
establishment
some
girls
who
have
been
seduced
have
when
entering
on
a
life
of
prostitution
extensive
and
valuable
wardrobes
the
mistress
runs
them
into
debts
of
her
own
contracting
and
if
they
become
dissatisfied
with
their
treatment
and
desire
to
leave
they
are
held
for
the
debt
by
the
common
law
of
england
all
debts
incurred
for
an
immoral
purpose
are
void
but
this
law
is
of
little
value
to
those
who
are
ignorant
of
its
existence
besides
which
the
have
possession
of
the
booty
and
thus
effectually
drive
the
debtor
to
an
adjustment
of
the
matters
in
dispute
such
of
the
as
have
no
lawful
husbands
form
intimacies
with
some
man
whom
they
support
in
slang
dialect
there
is
a
class
of
men
called
spooneys
who
support
the
women
or
furnish
them
with
funds
when
necessary
they
set
them
up
in
business
become
responsible
for
their
debts
and
assist
them
in
all
their
difficulties
the
fancy
men
are
those
who
do
nothing
for
them
but
live
at
their
expense
the
lower
class
of
have
no
spooneys
but
they
invariably
have
fancy
men
who
act
as
bullies
and
settle
by
physical
force
any
disputes
that
may
arise
between
the
inmates
and
their
visitors
these
men
spend
the
day
in
taverns
and
the
night
in
the
particular
brothels
to
which
they
are
attached
and
are
frequently
felons
of
the
deepest
dye
some
of
the
are
married
women
and
even
mothers
of
families
the
husbands
are
lazy
worthless
wretches
addicted
to
gambling
and
drinking
and
brutally
indifferent
to
the
sources
from
which
their
luxuries
are
supplied
in
some
cases
the
wealthier
individuals
have
been
known
to
send
their
children
to
good
schools
away
from
home
and
to
have
kept
them
in
ignorance
of
their
own
wretched
vocation
thus
sin
entails
its
own
punishment
the
number
of
brothels
in
london
has
been
variously
estimated
the
whole
number
of
houses
at
the
last
census
was
three
hundred
thousand
and
upward
among
them
it
was
calculated
and
probably
correctly
that
there
were
five
thousand
brothels
including
houses
of
assignation
the
rents
of
these
establishments
vary
as
much
as
the
houses
and
situations
from
fifteen
hundred
down
to
one
hundred
dollars
a
year
in
good
neighborhoods
we
should
be
slow
to
believe
that
landlords
had
any
previous
knowledge
of
the
purposes
to
which
their
houses
are
to
be
applied
independent
of
moral
objection
such
a
house
deteriorates
the
character
of
the
property
indeed
the
clauses
in
leases
of
the
great
london
properties
are
very
strict
and
include
all
objectionable
trades
as
causes
of
forfeiture
the
owners
of
the
houses
are
of
all
classes
the
almonry
of
westminster
once
the
abode
of
caxton
which
within
these
six
or
eight
years
has
been
pulled
down
was
one
of
the
vilest
aggregations
of
vice
and
crime
in
existence
this
was
the
property
of
the
dean
and
chapter
of
westminster
abbey
the
common
law
of
england
as
already
mentioned
in
the
matter
of
dress
prohibits
the
recovery
of
the
rents
of
houses
let
for
immoral
purposes
many
of
the
themselves
hire
houses
furnish
them
and
sublet
them
it
has
been
made
a
matter
of
reproach
that
landlords
should
even
indirectly
derive
income
from
such
sources
but
poverty
and
vice
are
closely
allied
where
poverty
exists
vice
will
come
it
is
impossible
for
a
landlord
to
exclude
any
class
of
tenants
in
a
particular
neighborhood
suited
to
them
and
those
who
know
aught
about
the
improvement
and
ventilation
of
large
cities
and
the
breaking
up
of
bad
neighborhoods
are
well
aware
that
they
are
accompanied
with
a
fearful
amount
of
extra
misery
to
the
very
poor
in
a
subsequent
portion
of
this
work
we
have
endeavored
to
analyze
the
causes
of
prostitution
as
it
exists
in
the
city
of
new
york
it
may
be
reasonably
supposed
that
the
same
reasons
would
be
applicable
to
the
kindred
people
of
great
britain
we
give
the
following
mainly
deduced
from
english
writers
as
indicating
the
sentiments
of
the
in
that
kingdom
as
to
the
sources
of
so
an
evil
which
must
be
sought
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
national
as
well
as
personal
a
professional
man
tait
to
whose
pages
we
have
turned
for
information
as
to
prostitution
in
great
britain
classifies
the
causes
as
natural
and
accidental
the
natural
he
subdivides
into
licentiousness
of
disposition
irritability
of
temper
pride
and
love
of
dress
dishonesty
and
love
of
property
and
indolence
the
accidental
include
seduction
marriages
low
wages
want
of
employment
intemperance
poverty
defective
education
bad
example
of
parents
obscene
publications
and
a
number
of
minor
causes
without
assenting
to
the
classification
we
will
accept
the
enumeration
the
operation
of
sexual
desire
on
the
female
sex
is
a
mooted
question
among
english
writers
on
prostitution
whether
it
is
latent
and
never
powerful
enough
to
provoke
evil
courses
until
it
is
itself
stimulated
and
roused
into
energy
by
external
circumstances
or
whether
it
be
an
active
principle
impelling
the
female
mind
to
sacrifice
and
reputation
in
the
gratification
of
dominant
impulses
has
been
frequently
discussed
many
consider
that
its
influence
on
the
inducement
of
prostitution
is
no
less
unsatisfactory
of
solution
than
the
physiological
problem
alleging
that
those
who
have
followed
the
bent
of
their
natural
appetites
would
undoubtedly
prefer
to
ascribe
their
lapse
to
other
circumstances
this
subject
is
treated
more
fully
elsewhere
and
it
is
needless
to
repeat
here
the
views
there
expressed
that
sexual
desire
does
exercise
a
potent
influence
on
the
female
organization
can
not
be
questioned
which
is
a
perverted
indulgence
of
the
natural
instinct
is
well
known
to
english
physicians
as
being
practiced
among
young
women
to
a
great
extent
though
in
a
far
less
degree
than
among
young
men
its
frightful
influences
upon
the
latter
have
been
the
subject
of
the
liveliest
anxiety
to
those
who
have
made
the
care
of
youth
their
profession
and
this
source
of
trouble
is
shared
to
some
degree
by
female
teachers
such
subjects
seem
by
common
consent
to
be
banished
from
rational
investigation
by
the
majority
of
people
as
if
shutting
one
eyes
to
the
fact
would
prove
its
this
false
delicacy
is
more
injurious
than
is
commonly
supposed
for
the
unchecked
indulgence
in
such
habits
is
not
only
destructive
of
health
but
in
the
highest
degree
inimical
to
the
moral
feeling
and
directly
subversive
of
all
leaving
but
one
step
to
complete
the
final
descent
the
effect
of
undue
familiarity
and
too
unrestrained
an
intercourse
between
the
sexes
can
not
be
exaggerated
as
paving
the
way
for
the
last
lapse
from
virtue
it
is
precisely
these
familiarities
which
in
minds
excite
the
first
impulses
of
desire
and
even
where
such
a
result
does
not
immediately
flow
from
too
free
an
intercourse
it
breaks
down
that
modesty
and
reserve
which
so
much
enhance
the
beauty
of
woman
and
constitute
her
best
safeguard
the
inclined
plane
by
which
the
female
who
permits
the
first
freedom
glides
unchecked
to
final
ruin
though
gradual
is
very
difficult
to
retrace
the
unrestricted
intercourse
permitted
or
rather
encouraged
between
the
sexes
at
places
of
public
amusement
much
facilitates
the
opportunities
of
seduction
prostitutes
frequently
and
we
believe
with
truth
allege
seduction
as
the
first
step
toward
their
abandoned
course
of
life
and
the
allegation
itself
should
induce
a
sympathy
for
the
misfortune
of
their
present
existence
although
in
some
cases
the
story
can
not
be
implicitly
believed
at
the
same
time
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
heartless
seduction
is
but
too
frequent
a
circumstance
in
such
cases
and
contributes
its
sad
quota
of
heavy
account
to
prostitution
it
is
a
general
opinion
that
cases
of
so
called
seduction
in
england
occur
between
employers
and
female
servants
and
that
of
these
are
vast
numbers
by
seduction
in
such
circumstances
is
meant
the
inducement
to
do
wrong
by
promises
or
other
suasives
in
opposition
to
the
commonly
received
idea
which
makes
the
fall
the
result
of
strong
personal
attachment
in
a
work
like
this
we
must
notice
the
largest
definitions
and
can
not
consistently
limit
ourselves
to
the
inducement
customarily
brought
forward
in
law
proceedings
namely
a
promise
of
marriage
in
this
sense
illegitimate
children
may
be
said
to
be
the
consequence
of
seduction
certainly
not
all
of
them
however
because
many
persons
voluntarily
and
with
their
eyes
open
enter
upon
cohabitation
arrangements
but
doubtless
many
are
once
seduced
of
course
the
female
becomes
herself
the
seducer
of
the
inexperienced
the
policy
of
english
law
of
late
years
has
been
to
compel
the
woman
to
protect
herself
in
the
main
a
wise
policy
but
the
balance
of
human
justice
is
very
unevenly
maintained
the
male
the
real
delinquent
incurs
no
legal
punishment
and
but
little
social
reprobation
actions
for
seduction
are
very
unpopular
and
those
brought
bear
but
an
infinitesimal
proportion
to
the
occurrence
of
the
crime
the
of
proof
in
bastardy
affiliations
of
course
rests
upon
the
woman
of
late
years
the
alterations
in
the
law
have
thrown
great
difficulties
in
her
way
by
what
is
called
the
necessity
of
corroborative
evidence
namely
some
kind
of
admission
direct
or
indirect
or
some
overt
act
which
will
furnish
oral
or
documentary
testimony
other
than
the
woman
unsupported
statement
this
may
be
strictly
expedient
but
it
renders
the
man
almost
irresponsible
if
he
only
play
his
part
with
knavish
prudence
lastly
popular
feeling
is
against
charges
of
rape
acquittal
is
very
frequent
and
the
usual
rebuttal
is
to
impeach
the
character
of
the
prosecutrix
the
opinion
of
one
of
england
greatest
judges
has
passed
into
a
proverb
no
charge
so
easy
to
make
none
so
difficult
to
disprove
queen
elizabeth
mode
of
proving
her
disbelief
of
rape
is
also
expressive
of
public
opinion
from
the
combination
of
these
circumstances
it
would
seem
that
seduction
must
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
lead
to
prostitution
inasmuch
as
in
ordinary
english
parlance
the
mother
of
a
bastard
and
a
prostitute
are
almost
synonymous
overcrowded
the
natural
impulses
of
animal
instinct
in
both
sexes
seem
to
be
implicated
in
the
effect
of
crowded
sleeping
apartments
as
met
with
in
the
habitations
of
the
poor
both
in
town
and
country
in
the
latter
we
have
the
show
and
sometimes
the
reality
of
family
life
and
virtuous
poverty
in
the
towns
we
find
abodes
of
poverty
sometimes
honest
sometimes
in
closest
propinquity
or
intimacy
with
vice
and
there
too
we
have
the
of
the
lowest
depravity
and
vagabondism
those
who
have
not
given
their
attention
to
the
condition
of
the
poor
and
the
relation
which
their
lives
hold
to
the
ordinary
habits
of
decency
and
morality
have
much
difficulty
in
comprehending
or
even
believing
statements
which
embody
the
plainest
truths
it
is
hard
to
realize
things
as
they
are
if
the
mind
has
been
full
of
ideal
pictures
of
things
as
they
should
be
the
dives
of
society
has
been
often
reproached
with
his
ignorance
of
lazarus
the
sin
lies
exactly
in
that
ignorance
as
carlyle
finely
says
the
duty
of
christian
society
is
to
find
its
work
and
to
do
it
negative
virtue
is
of
no
practical
use
to
the
community
but
yet
the
ignorance
is
natural
enough
and
no
easier
of
removal
than
other
ignorance
it
has
been
generally
attributed
to
the
wealthy
and
upper
classes
of
society
but
it
exists
just
the
same
differing
only
a
little
in
degree
in
the
middle
class
and
moderately
rich
members
of
the
english
social
system
the
misery
and
inconvenience
which
the
poor
suffer
from
the
straitness
of
their
domestic
arrangements
are
beyond
belief
girls
and
boys
sleep
in
the
same
bed
brothers
and
sisters
to
say
nothing
of
less
intimate
relations
are
in
the
closest
contiguity
and
even
strangers
who
are
admitted
into
the
little
home
to
help
in
eking
out
the
rent
are
placed
on
the
same
family
footing
this
momentous
question
to
the
moral
of
the
poor
has
excited
very
lively
interest
in
england
and
has
called
into
active
operation
several
philanthropic
associations
which
have
in
view
the
employment
of
capital
in
improving
and
cheapening
the
dwellings
of
the
working
classes
in
london
this
system
of
close
lodging
was
carried
to
a
fearful
pitch
in
some
places
from
five
to
thirteen
persons
slept
in
a
single
bed
while
in
the
country
the
evil
was
nearly
as
bad
although
from
the
slight
restraint
imposed
by
family
ties
the
actual
evil
is
positively
less
though
the
moral
contamination
is
of
nearly
the
same
extent
and
paves
the
way
for
other
relations
out
of
doors
the
facts
which
justify
these
conclusions
are
to
be
found
in
a
variety
of
shapes
parliamentary
reports
statistical
tables
appeals
from
clergymen
addresses
from
philanthropic
associations
etc
the
honorable
and
reverend
osborne
a
clergyman
well
known
for
his
philanthropic
exertions
in
behalf
of
the
poor
says
of
country
life
in
england
from
infancy
to
puberty
the
laborer
children
sleep
in
the
same
room
with
his
wife
and
himself
and
whatever
attempts
at
decency
may
be
made
and
i
have
seen
many
ingenious
and
most
praiseworthy
attempts
still
there
is
the
fact
of
the
old
and
the
young
married
and
unmarried
of
both
sexes
all
herded
together
in
one
and
the
same
sleeping
apartment
i
do
not
choose
to
put
on
paper
the
disgusting
scenes
that
i
have
known
to
occur
from
the
promiscuous
crowding
of
the
sexes
together
however
to
what
the
mind
of
the
young
female
is
exposed
from
her
very
childhood
i
have
long
ceased
to
wonder
at
the
otherwise
seeming
precocious
licentiousness
of
conversation
which
may
be
heard
in
every
field
where
many
of
the
young
are
at
work
austin
assistant
commissioner
says
the
sleeping
of
boys
and
girls
young
men
and
young
women
in
beds
almost
touching
one
another
must
have
the
effect
of
breaking
down
the
great
barriers
between
the
sexes
the
accommodation
for
sleeping
is
such
as
necessarily
to
create
early
and
illicit
familiarity
between
the
sexes
without
entering
into
disgusting
details
the
pain
of
perusing
which
could
add
nothing
to
the
value
of
the
statements
the
conclusion
is
indisputable
that
much
of
prostitution
if
not
of
prostitution
for
hire
certainly
of
prostitution
from
corrupt
and
profligate
motives
is
engendered
by
the
vicious
habits
induced
by
habitual
proximity
of
the
sexes
in
early
life
the
prostitutes
themselves
frequently
assign
these
habits
as
the
commencement
of
their
career
of
vice
and
some
even
admit
the
breach
of
the
closest
natural
ties
during
early
youth
by
reason
of
the
too
great
facilities
thus
offered
the
great
importance
of
this
want
of
decency
and
propriety
in
family
life
can
not
be
overrated
the
contagious
nature
of
vice
is
proverbial
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
imagine
the
power
attained
by
children
and
the
fatal
readiness
with
which
their
sinful
words
and
practices
are
propagated
the
cheap
are
a
pendant
to
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
although
they
do
not
produce
the
same
early
pernicious
results
as
indecency
and
immorality
in
family
life
the
latter
prepare
the
way
to
the
scenes
of
the
common
in
which
the
lowest
depth
of
vice
is
speedily
reached
here
prostitution
is
habitual
a
regular
institution
of
the
place
the
smallest
imaginable
quantities
of
food
can
be
purchased
adults
youths
and
children
of
both
sexes
are
received
and
herd
promiscuously
together
the
prices
of
beds
are
of
the
lowest
from
three
to
six
cents
no
questions
are
asked
and
the
place
is
free
to
all
a
is
soon
initiated
or
rather
forced
into
all
the
mysteries
of
iniquity
obscenity
and
blasphemy
are
the
staple
conversation
of
the
inmates
every
indecency
is
openly
performed
the
girls
recite
aloud
their
experiences
of
life
ten
or
a
dozen
sleep
in
one
bed
many
in
a
state
of
nudity
indeed
the
details
of
these
places
are
horrible
beyond
description
unmitigated
vice
and
lustful
orgies
reign
unchecked
by
precept
or
example
and
the
point
of
rivalry
is
as
to
who
shall
excel
in
filth
and
abomination
example
is
the
next
immediate
cause
in
what
may
be
considered
the
natural
series
there
are
a
few
prostitutes
who
have
children
that
these
latter
should
follow
the
same
course
is
quite
in
the
common
course
of
events
although
considerable
anxiety
is
occasionally
evinced
by
such
women
to
have
their
children
brought
up
to
better
courses
such
redemption
is
all
but
impossible
in
ordinary
life
however
the
mind
of
youth
is
often
perverted
by
direct
evil
example
in
the
elders
and
as
we
have
already
remarked
the
corruption
of
the
human
affections
in
their
family
life
where
they
ought
to
be
sweetest
and
purest
is
more
fatally
demoralizing
and
more
certain
to
insure
eventual
ruin
than
almost
any
other
fathers
and
mothers
are
both
wanting
often
enough
in
their
duty
although
it
is
a
matter
of
universal
faith
that
the
influence
and
example
of
the
father
are
of
less
importance
than
that
of
the
mother
a
bad
man
may
have
virtuous
children
a
bad
woman
hardly
ever
there
are
cases
where
the
mother
and
daughter
sleep
in
the
same
bed
each
with
a
male
partner
in
the
city
of
edinburgh
there
are
two
mothers
prostitutes
each
with
four
daughters
prostitutes
five
prostitute
mothers
each
with
three
prostitute
daughters
ten
such
with
two
daughters
each
and
such
with
one
daughter
each
all
following
the
practices
of
the
mothers
such
influences
brought
to
bear
on
the
young
are
irresistible
this
may
perhaps
account
for
the
number
of
sisters
who
carry
on
prostitution
the
effect
of
mere
sisterly
example
would
be
sufficient
to
account
for
the
circumstance
but
the
parental
becomes
almost
a
compulsion
inasmuch
as
the
parent
in
such
circumstances
the
mother
will
not
only
connive
at
but
be
the
main
cause
of
her
child
ruin
for
her
own
direct
profit
and
advantage
this
indeed
seems
more
accordant
with
our
ideas
of
the
natural
tendencies
of
prostitutes
and
procuresses
than
that
such
persons
should
be
excessively
anxious
for
their
children
purity
and
moral
welfare
poverty
is
an
integral
part
of
nearly
all
the
conditions
of
life
which
we
have
to
consider
as
incentives
to
prostitution
some
instances
more
perhaps
than
may
be
generally
credited
poverty
is
a
direct
and
proximate
cause
of
this
in
other
words
previously
and
otherwise
virtuous
do
prostitute
their
bodies
for
in
most
of
the
cases
enumerated
except
that
purely
natural
but
rare
one
innate
sexual
desire
poverty
is
a
remote
cause
from
the
number
of
the
human
race
who
are
under
its
griping
chilling
pressure
poverty
may
be
set
down
as
a
fruitful
source
of
prostitution
the
connection
of
political
circumstances
with
the
phases
of
public
morals
is
more
intimate
than
the
consideration
of
the
superficial
differences
of
the
two
matters
would
at
first
sight
imply
but
an
attentive
comparison
of
the
state
of
public
prosperity
with
the
state
of
public
crime
will
show
that
crime
is
somewhat
dependent
on
food
the
man
with
a
stomach
is
no
foe
to
order
prostitution
as
a
means
of
supplying
the
cravings
of
hunger
is
part
of
the
same
connection
it
is
true
that
in
england
there
are
and
from
and
in
which
every
destitute
person
without
reference
to
character
has
a
right
to
food
and
shelter
in
the
first
place
however
the
are
objects
of
unmitigated
aversion
to
the
poorer
classes
various
rules
in
themselves
hard
but
rendered
necessary
by
consideration
for
the
as
well
as
for
the
beneficiaries
such
as
separation
of
husband
and
wife
while
receiving
relief
separation
of
child
and
parent
make
the
system
odious
to
the
worthy
and
honest
poor
while
the
strict
rules
and
the
restraint
and
discipline
enforced
within
the
walls
make
it
still
more
odious
to
those
who
place
their
happiness
in
license
and
irregularity
added
to
this
in
populous
and
poor
districts
the
claims
upon
the
in
seasons
of
distress
are
too
numerous
for
its
capabilities
it
is
an
awful
truth
that
notwithstanding
the
enormous
revenues
nearly
fifty
millions
of
dollars
per
annum
collected
for
poor
relief
and
the
immense
establishments
instituted
throughout
the
country
for
the
support
and
shelter
of
the
distressed
sometimes
the
number
of
applicants
is
so
great
that
their
demands
can
not
be
met
possibly
if
these
unfortunates
could
be
distributed
throughout
the
kingdom
so
that
the
poverty
of
one
spot
could
be
balanced
by
the
comparative
prosperity
of
another
the
fearful
starvation
in
the
midst
of
plenty
which
is
occasionally
witnessed
need
not
occur
but
in
the
mean
while
and
until
the
time
when
all
the
schemes
and
devices
of
modern
improvement
and
advancement
shall
be
finally
perfected
and
universal
happiness
attained
there
is
a
mass
of
inconceivable
wretchedness
to
be
dealt
with
in
household
words
for
november
dickens
gives
a
harrowing
picture
of
london
distress
of
which
he
was
himself
an
it
was
a
dark
rainy
evening
and
close
against
the
wall
of
whitechapel
lay
five
bundles
of
rags
dickens
and
his
friend
looked
at
them
and
attempted
to
rouse
them
in
vain
they
knocked
at
the
door
were
admitted
saw
the
master
of
the
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
there
were
five
human
beings
females
lying
on
the
ground
outside
cold
and
hungry
he
did
at
first
he
was
annoyed
such
applications
were
frequent
how
could
he
meet
them
the
house
was
full
the
casual
ward
was
full
what
could
he
do
more
when
he
found
that
dickens
aim
was
inquiry
not
he
was
softened
the
case
was
certainly
shocking
how
was
it
to
be
met
dickens
said
he
had
heard
outside
that
these
wretched
beings
had
been
there
two
nights
already
it
was
very
possible
he
could
not
deny
or
affirm
it
there
were
often
more
in
the
same
plight
sometimes
twenty
or
thirty
he
the
master
was
obliged
to
give
preference
to
women
with
children
the
place
was
full
unable
to
do
more
dickens
left
on
getting
outside
he
roused
one
of
these
poor
wretches
she
looked
up
but
said
nothing
he
asked
her
if
she
was
hungry
she
merely
looked
an
affirmative
would
she
know
where
to
get
something
to
eat
she
again
assented
in
the
same
way
then
take
this
and
for
sake
go
and
get
something
she
took
it
made
no
sign
of
thanks
gathered
herself
up
and
slunk
away
wilted
into
darkness
silent
and
heedless
of
all
things
to
what
will
not
such
misery
as
this
compel
suffering
human
nature
in
times
of
commercial
depression
the
police
of
london
note
an
increase
of
street
prostitution
it
is
said
in
the
cities
of
england
that
the
permanent
prostitution
of
each
place
has
a
numerical
relation
to
the
means
of
occupation
in
edinburgh
there
are
but
few
chances
of
employing
female
labor
glasgow
dundee
and
paisley
are
the
seats
of
manufactures
and
employ
female
labor
extensively
according
to
tait
the
prostitution
of
edinburgh
far
exceeds
its
proportion
of
prostitution
to
population
as
compared
with
the
manufacturing
towns
it
seems
unnecessary
to
multiply
instances
of
poverty
and
indigence
inasmuch
as
the
fact
is
most
miserably
indisputable
at
three
cents
at
five
or
six
cents
unceasing
labor
of
fourteen
hours
a
day
bringing
in
only
sixty
or
eighty
cents
a
week
and
competition
even
to
obtain
this
as
the
london
once
said
the
needle
is
the
normal
employment
of
every
english
woman
what
then
must
be
the
condition
of
those
tens
of
thousands
who
have
nothing
but
that
to
depend
upon
of
late
years
too
a
still
farther
competition
has
been
introduced
in
that
ingenious
invention
of
our
country
the
sewing
machine
in
order
to
show
the
relation
between
unpaid
and
excessive
labor
and
prostitution
we
will
instance
a
few
cases
one
young
woman
said
she
made
moleskin
pantaloons
a
very
strong
stiff
fabric
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
cents
per
pair
she
could
manage
twelve
pairs
per
week
when
there
was
full
employment
sometimes
she
could
not
get
work
she
worked
from
six
in
the
morning
until
ten
at
night
with
full
work
she
could
make
two
dollars
a
week
out
of
which
she
had
to
expend
cents
for
thread
and
candle
on
an
average
in
consequence
of
short
work
she
could
not
make
more
than
cents
a
week
her
father
was
dead
and
she
had
to
support
her
mother
who
was
sixty
years
of
age
this
girl
endured
her
mode
of
existence
for
three
years
till
at
length
she
agreed
to
live
with
a
young
man
when
she
made
this
statement
she
was
within
three
months
of
her
confinement
she
felt
the
disgrace
of
her
condition
to
relieve
her
from
which
she
said
she
prayed
for
death
and
would
not
have
gone
wrong
if
she
could
have
helped
it
such
a
case
as
this
scarcely
comes
within
the
term
prostitution
but
she
stated
that
many
girls
at
the
shop
advised
prostitution
as
a
resource
and
that
others
should
do
as
they
did
as
by
that
means
they
had
procured
plenty
to
eat
and
clothes
to
wear
she
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
none
of
the
thousands
of
girls
who
work
at
the
same
business
earn
a
livelihood
by
their
needle
but
that
all
must
and
do
prostitute
themselves
eke
out
a
another
woman
a
case
more
directly
in
point
also
said
she
could
not
earn
more
than
cents
she
was
a
widow
and
had
three
children
when
her
husband
died
herself
and
her
children
had
to
live
on
these
cents
she
might
have
gone
into
the
and
been
there
better
supported
than
by
her
labor
had
she
done
so
the
laws
of
the
are
inexorable
she
would
have
been
separated
from
her
children
although
one
child
died
she
was
now
so
reduced
that
she
could
not
procure
food
she
took
to
the
streets
for
a
living
and
she
declared
that
hundreds
of
married
and
single
women
were
doing
the
same
thing
for
the
same
reasons
a
widow
who
had
buried
all
her
children
could
not
support
herself
from
sheer
inability
to
do
so
she
took
to
prostitution
a
remarkably
young
woman
whose
character
for
sobriety
honesty
and
industry
was
vouched
by
a
number
of
witnesses
as
unimpeachable
had
been
compelled
to
work
at
fine
shirts
by
which
she
could
not
earn
more
on
an
average
than
cents
a
week
she
had
a
child
and
being
unwilling
to
go
to
the
she
was
driven
by
indigence
to
the
streets
struck
with
remorse
and
shame
and
for
the
sake
of
her
child
determined
to
abandon
prostitution
she
fasted
whole
days
sleeping
in
in
sheds
once
her
child
legs
froze
to
her
side
and
necessity
again
compelled
her
to
take
to
her
former
course
her
father
had
been
an
independent
preacher
these
circumstances
and
innumerable
others
will
establish
incontestably
the
intimate
relation
which
poverty
bears
to
prostitution
a
consideration
of
such
circumstances
as
the
foregoing
and
the
observation
of
hosts
of
others
of
a
similar
character
which
will
come
within
the
cognizance
of
any
one
who
searches
into
human
motives
must
incline
all
but
the
most
outrageously
virtuous
to
judge
more
tenderly
of
the
failings
and
errors
of
their
all
young
females
engaged
in
sewing
are
liable
to
the
same
distress
and
the
same
resource
against
it
is
of
course
open
to
all
the
hard
labor
and
long
hours
are
the
least
part
of
the
evil
although
in
that
light
even
there
would
be
ground
for
commiseration
the
real
grievance
is
that
the
most
patient
and
industrious
can
not
by
any
hours
of
labor
earn
a
sufficiency
to
support
themselves
it
is
true
that
the
is
the
legal
refuge
of
the
poor
but
the
tender
mercies
of
the
have
passed
into
a
proverb
the
policy
of
the
as
administered
is
to
deter
the
needy
from
applying
for
relief
except
in
very
extreme
cases
hence
many
rules
are
made
and
much
formality
is
interposed
which
render
the
legal
provisions
so
irksome
and
unbearable
that
many
fly
to
the
nearest
means
of
satisfying
their
wants
rather
than
demand
their
legal
rights
domestic
servants
are
in
respect
of
their
removal
from
absolute
want
while
in
service
more
happily
situated
than
those
who
are
thus
dependent
upon
the
needle
but
they
are
open
to
influences
of
another
kind
we
mean
seduction
by
masters
and
male
members
of
the
household
where
this
evil
begins
is
an
exceedingly
difficult
question
to
determine
when
corrupted
they
become
themselves
by
the
very
opportunities
they
possess
ready
and
dangerous
instruments
of
corruption
and
contribute
to
disseminate
the
poisons
of
immorality
and
of
bodily
disease
we
have
already
incidentally
mentioned
that
this
class
is
at
times
open
to
a
great
deal
of
poverty
and
distress
namely
when
out
of
service
and
at
such
times
they
are
peculiarly
the
mark
for
the
lures
of
persons
who
make
seduction
their
business
and
profitable
occupation
the
domestic
servants
and
the
are
the
principal
adult
laborers
of
great
britain
except
the
factory
girls
in
there
were
female
domestic
servants
seamstresses
and
of
these
one
third
were
under
twenty
years
of
age
places
of
public
amusement
in
england
are
few
when
compared
with
those
of
the
continent
and
their
influence
must
be
proportionately
less
on
the
continent
dancing
saloons
are
a
prominent
feature
in
england
this
character
of
entertainment
is
almost
unknown
in
london
there
are
a
few
places
of
this
sort
such
for
example
as
cremorne
gardens
tait
lays
some
stress
on
the
evil
effects
of
in
edinburgh
we
should
be
inclined
to
think
the
cases
of
misconduct
traceable
to
these
places
actually
few
in
number
though
not
unworthy
of
notice
the
single
females
who
frequent
theatres
and
other
similar
places
in
england
without
friends
or
family
escort
have
very
little
virtue
to
risk
the
country
fairs
are
far
more
injurious
they
are
indiscriminately
attended
by
all
ages
and
sexes
and
their
effects
upon
the
female
agricultural
population
are
often
very
pernicious
greenwich
fair
a
three
days
scene
of
rollicking
and
junketing
was
held
at
easter
and
whitsuntide
in
the
outskirts
of
london
but
is
now
abolished
it
had
its
uses
a
century
or
two
ago
but
recently
had
been
attended
by
all
the
idlers
of
london
of
both
sexes
and
was
justly
dreaded
by
the
friends
of
youth
it
is
proverbial
that
more
young
women
were
debauched
at
greenwich
fair
allowing
for
its
duration
than
at
any
other
place
in
england
marriages
are
decidedly
a
cause
of
prostitution
certainly
breach
of
the
marriage
vow
is
one
thing
prostitution
for
hire
another
in
estimating
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
edinburgh
at
eight
hundred
tait
adds
two
hundred
to
them
under
the
head
of
married
women
which
he
considers
accrue
from
marriages
that
the
marriage
was
is
plainly
shown
by
its
result
and
that
want
of
congeniality
and
temperament
is
the
cause
of
prostitution
to
the
extent
thus
named
we
have
no
ground
to
question
he
speaks
of
such
women
selling
their
favors
generally
to
one
lover
only
occasionally
to
any
one
who
will
pay
although
the
latter
forms
what
is
commonly
known
as
prostitution
no
other
construction
can
be
put
upon
the
former
love
of
dress
is
another
incident
which
many
writers
and
tait
among
them
have
introduced
into
the
direct
causes
of
prostitution
we
should
consider
it
doubtful
if
any
woman
ever
positively
sold
her
virtue
for
a
new
gown
or
a
knot
of
ribbons
of
course
after
the
rubicon
is
crossed
all
subsequent
steps
are
easy
and
may
be
taken
from
any
motive
the
love
of
admiration
which
under
regulation
is
sometimes
a
commendable
instinct
when
uncontrolled
becomes
a
snare
the
love
of
dress
is
a
modification
of
this
sentiment
and
may
help
to
work
out
the
effect
when
other
causes
have
overthrown
the
balance
of
the
mind
juvenile
we
have
now
arrived
in
the
consideration
of
the
causes
of
prostitution
in
england
at
decidedly
the
most
painful
of
all
the
phenomena
connected
with
this
condition
of
human
life
namely
the
immense
extent
of
juvenile
depravity
we
have
already
sketched
the
evils
of
insufficient
house
accommodation
and
its
noxious
effects
upon
the
morals
of
the
rising
generation
in
this
connection
also
bad
example
is
particularly
prominent
perhaps
indeed
with
respect
to
the
young
evil
communications
are
the
greatest
dangers
the
was
formerly
one
great
of
vice
and
the
greatest
license
and
irregularity
prevailed
in
every
department
that
children
born
or
brought
up
in
such
a
place
should
grow
up
debased
was
perfectly
in
the
expected
course
of
things
now
however
under
the
new
commission
the
scene
is
stripped
of
its
more
revolting
accessories
the
sexes
do
not
mingle
children
do
not
associate
with
adults
some
modicum
of
education
is
given
the
sweetest
and
holiest
of
all
ties
that
of
family
is
yet
wanting
and
is
totally
deficient
in
the
absence
of
these
protective
influences
the
wonder
is
not
that
so
many
children
should
turn
out
ill
but
that
so
many
girls
should
turn
out
well
formerly
also
there
was
a
system
of
compulsory
pauper
apprenticeship
and
the
interests
of
the
parish
apprentice
out
of
doors
were
very
little
looked
after
this
again
has
been
altered
both
in
town
and
country
and
the
improvement
is
marked
even
with
all
this
it
is
recorded
in
the
london
june
that
a
correspondent
visiting
one
of
the
metropolitan
was
struck
by
the
happy
and
healthy
appearance
of
the
female
children
and
inquired
of
the
master
of
the
what
became
of
all
of
them
he
was
informed
that
they
were
sent
out
at
the
age
of
fourteen
as
servants
or
in
other
capacities
and
that
of
them
after
coming
backward
and
forward
from
their
places
to
the
eventually
got
corrupted
and
took
to
the
streets
factories
are
made
accountable
by
many
writers
for
much
juvenile
immorality
and
prostitution
factories
in
england
are
as
most
of
our
readers
are
aware
institutions
materially
differing
in
some
respects
from
those
of
our
own
country
in
no
feature
is
there
so
wide
a
dissimilarity
as
in
the
character
of
the
the
factory
children
of
england
are
the
offspring
of
the
poorest
of
the
community
whose
only
heritage
is
pauperism
with
wages
at
no
time
too
good
and
often
at
starvation
point
the
miserable
earnings
of
the
factory
operatives
are
still
farther
reduced
by
constant
strikes
and
contests
with
their
employers
in
which
it
is
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
workmen
must
yield
macaulay
tells
us
that
two
centuries
ago
the
employment
of
children
in
factories
and
the
dependence
of
the
parent
bread
upon
the
children
earnings
was
a
notorious
fact
much
condemned
by
philanthropists
the
introduction
of
machinery
and
the
value
of
gradually
aggravated
all
the
horrors
of
the
factory
system
the
enormity
of
which
called
down
the
indignation
of
the
community
and
compelled
the
protective
interference
of
parliament
the
ten
hours
bill
the
factory
childrens
education
regulations
appointment
by
government
of
factory
commissioners
and
inspectors
have
all
contributed
to
ameliorate
the
hard
lot
of
the
factory
child
the
employment
of
very
young
children
in
factories
is
still
to
be
regretted
or
rather
its
necessity
for
probably
it
is
better
they
should
be
employed
in
a
not
very
laborious
occupation
than
left
to
roam
the
streets
the
direct
influence
of
factory
work
on
juvenile
prostitution
is
insisted
on
by
many
writers
by
others
some
reservations
have
been
introduced
such
as
the
young
associate
only
during
hours
of
recreation
in
business
hours
they
are
generally
employed
in
different
parts
of
the
building
they
have
a
certain
amount
of
education
their
parents
are
generally
or
very
often
employed
in
the
same
establishment
assume
that
these
children
were
not
in
the
factory
where
would
they
be
and
what
could
they
do
are
evil
influences
rife
only
in
the
factory
the
overcrowding
at
home
the
frequent
drunkenness
and
debauchery
of
their
parents
and
associates
the
endless
indigence
the
frequent
visits
to
the
are
all
circumstances
which
have
been
considered
and
argued
in
the
case
but
of
the
fact
of
juvenile
prostitution
and
depravity
in
factory
populations
none
can
doubt
of
its
being
exclusively
or
chiefly
attributable
to
factory
life
others
are
not
certain
that
children
who
labor
in
factories
and
thereby
contribute
to
the
family
earnings
and
their
own
support
could
do
better
in
the
present
condition
of
english
society
is
doubtful
are
required
to
devote
a
portion
of
their
time
to
education
are
established
personal
attention
is
paid
by
leading
to
the
improvement
of
the
poor
many
build
good
cottages
for
which
by
the
way
they
receive
a
good
interest
in
the
way
of
rent
many
inspect
the
schools
some
build
and
pay
the
teachers
the
good
example
of
benevolent
in
a
measure
compels
others
whose
moral
perceptions
are
less
keen
to
follow
them
we
would
not
be
supposed
to
argue
that
english
cotton
factories
are
types
of
the
millennium
any
more
than
are
similar
institutions
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
in
fact
we
have
a
very
decided
opinion
on
the
matter
but
common
honesty
requires
that
the
opinion
of
all
who
have
investigated
the
subject
should
be
fairly
recorded
in
submitting
the
various
arguments
adduced
in
favor
of
factory
labor
and
its
bearing
on
immorality
we
present
merely
subjects
for
consideration
disease
in
a
fact
of
importance
to
public
health
is
the
disease
acquired
by
children
in
the
first
address
issued
by
the
london
society
for
the
protection
of
young
females
it
is
stated
that
in
three
of
the
london
hospitals
during
the
preceding
eight
years
there
had
been
no
less
than
two
thousand
seven
hundred
cases
of
venereal
disease
in
children
between
eleven
and
sixteen
years
of
age
ryan
on
the
same
subject
speaking
from
his
professional
experience
as
medical
officer
of
several
charities
mentions
the
shock
he
felt
on
seeing
numerous
cases
of
venereal
disease
in
children
miller
of
glasgow
testifies
to
the
same
fact
the
very
imperfect
data
which
exist
on
this
important
branch
of
our
subject
will
not
enable
one
to
form
any
sound
opinion
on
the
spread
of
disease
from
these
juvenile
sources
it
is
however
reasonable
to
conclude
from
the
few
facts
and
from
the
very
facilities
afforded
at
their
age
for
intercommunication
between
children
that
the
spread
of
disease
from
direct
contamination
and
the
deterioration
of
health
and
constitution
from
unknown
excesses
must
be
very
great
obscene
of
these
there
are
vast
numbers
and
the
extent
of
juvenile
contamination
from
this
source
must
be
very
great
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
vice
in
london
reports
having
seized
at
different
periods
thousands
of
obscene
books
and
prints
all
of
which
they
caused
to
be
destroyed
within
a
period
of
three
years
they
procured
the
destruction
of
blasphemous
and
impure
books
obscene
publications
obscene
songs
on
sheets
obscene
prints
and
even
this
was
but
an
item
in
the
calculation
the
police
of
london
take
but
little
interest
in
this
matter
the
society
is
the
principal
agent
in
the
repression
of
this
infamous
species
of
depravity
there
are
certain
places
in
london
in
which
the
trade
still
lives
and
flourishes
notwithstanding
the
attacks
made
upon
it
holywell
street
in
the
strand
and
the
vicinity
of
leicester
square
are
places
of
disgraceful
notoriety
in
this
respect
the
secret
is
that
wherever
there
is
a
public
demand
no
repressive
laws
will
ever
prevent
trade
the
attempt
at
repression
but
makes
it
more
profitable
to
the
corruption
of
the
youthful
mind
and
the
preparatives
for
prostitution
these
publications
must
contribute
it
is
matter
of
question
what
number
of
prostitutes
have
become
such
directly
from
this
cause
the
results
of
visitorial
inspection
do
not
show
among
london
prostitutes
any
more
than
elsewhere
a
taste
for
books
and
prints
of
an
obscene
tendency
their
taste
in
literature
is
that
which
would
prevail
among
persons
of
low
intellectual
calibre
startling
tales
romances
with
a
plentiful
spice
of
horrors
thrilling
highly
wrought
and
exaggerated
narratives
are
their
taste
in
the
practice
of
prostitution
the
use
of
indecent
or
prurient
prints
is
chiefly
for
the
adornment
of
rooms
in
brothels
in
the
relations
between
education
and
crime
are
found
no
distinctive
marks
whereby
prostitution
may
be
separated
from
any
other
development
of
vice
or
immorality
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
same
general
laws
which
apply
to
the
unregulated
manifestation
of
the
passions
apply
to
those
with
which
prostitution
is
chiefly
implicated
in
the
present
generation
it
is
generally
assumed
that
crime
is
the
offspring
of
ignorance
therefore
education
is
the
cry
education
has
become
a
party
watchword
in
england
the
necessity
of
education
the
quality
and
the
quantity
with
all
the
minor
propositions
that
branch
off
from
the
main
question
are
and
have
been
for
years
the
subject
of
the
hottest
polemics
but
recent
results
evolved
from
statistical
inquiries
would
seem
to
call
up
the
previous
question
as
to
the
value
of
education
at
all
the
present
work
is
not
the
place
in
which
to
discuss
the
fact
or
to
point
out
a
remedy
or
indicate
the
deficiencies
of
a
system
which
can
suffer
such
a
question
to
arise
we
give
the
facts
from
the
parliamentary
reports
of
it
appears
that
the
number
of
educated
criminals
in
england
was
at
that
time
more
than
twice
and
in
scotland
more
than
three
and
a
half
that
of
the
uneducated
years
england
scotland
in
calculating
a
percentage
on
certain
criminal
returns
during
the
undermentioned
years
the
results
were
educated
education
this
table
which
on
its
face
conclusively
establishes
an
increase
in
criminals
imperfectly
educated
and
a
decrease
both
in
those
who
could
read
and
write
well
and
those
who
could
not
read
or
write
at
all
may
be
and
has
been
made
the
subject
of
much
remark
as
proving
the
injury
of
education
in
the
first
place
it
only
shows
the
effects
of
partial
education
if
it
shows
any
thing
but
the
misfortune
of
statistical
results
is
that
they
are
relied
on
too
implicitly
with
a
subservience
to
figures
and
facts
whereas
they
require
to
be
accompanied
with
explanatory
circumstances
which
may
either
enhance
their
value
up
to
the
point
of
mathematical
demonstration
or
may
so
pare
them
away
as
to
render
them
perfectly
worthless
in
the
consideration
of
the
above
figures
all
that
would
seem
to
appear
is
that
there
was
an
increase
of
education
keeping
pace
with
the
increase
of
population
and
that
in
the
statistics
of
crime
the
increase
of
imperfectly
educated
people
would
be
as
perceptible
as
elsewhere
mere
reading
and
writing
unaccompanied
by
moral
elevation
will
not
reform
mankind
alone
they
will
not
prevent
a
hungry
man
from
satisfying
his
hunger
the
words
of
cæsar
apply
to
criminals
equally
as
to
conspirators
let
me
have
men
about
me
that
are
fat
men
and
such
as
sleep
yon
cassius
has
a
lean
and
hungry
look
pursuing
this
question
and
turning
to
the
population
tables
of
the
period
of
the
last
census
we
find
that
middlesex
was
the
most
generally
educated
county
taking
the
signature
of
the
marriage
register
as
the
test
of
education
per
cent
signed
the
marriage
register
yet
in
the
list
of
criminality
middlesex
stood
third
of
all
the
counties
of
england
gloucester
which
was
first
in
crime
was
far
from
being
the
most
ignorant
there
per
cent
signed
the
register
the
general
average
of
the
whole
population
by
the
same
list
is
forty
per
cent
here
again
is
a
qualifying
circumstance
london
is
included
in
middlesex
with
its
vast
seething
mass
of
human
misery
and
corruption
to
swell
the
record
of
crime
while
its
general
population
is
of
course
about
the
most
intelligent
of
the
british
empire
so
that
in
the
same
spot
is
found
at
once
the
greatest
intelligence
and
the
greatest
misery
we
are
not
aware
of
such
qualifying
circumstances
in
gloucestershire
ryan
writing
on
this
point
refers
to
the
metropolitan
police
report
for
by
which
it
appears
that
of
prostitutes
arrested
in
that
year
there
could
not
read
or
write
read
and
write
imperfectly
well
had
received
a
good
education
total
this
is
a
tolerably
fair
criterion
for
although
as
before
said
the
police
only
interfere
with
and
all
these
came
under
the
technical
term
of
drunk
and
disorderly
still
we
believe
the
state
of
prostitution
in
london
to
be
such
that
an
average
proportion
of
all
classes
of
courtesans
pass
through
the
hands
of
the
police
during
the
year
tait
speaking
of
edinburgh
confirms
the
view
put
forward
as
to
educational
influences
a
large
proportion
of
the
edinburgh
prostitutes
per
cent
read
and
write
the
scottish
peasantry
are
perhaps
the
in
europe
and
those
girls
who
come
to
edinburgh
from
the
country
are
no
exception
to
the
rule
the
uneducated
tait
thinks
are
city
girls
as
to
the
religious
denomination
of
prostitutes
for
that
a
prostitute
may
have
a
religion
we
may
say
in
the
kindly
spirit
of
corporal
trim
but
doubtingly
a
negro
has
a
soul
your
honor
in
edinburgh
they
include
all
sects
except
independents
baptists
and
quakers
there
may
be
those
who
smile
at
the
idea
of
a
prostitute
having
any
belief
how
many
of
us
are
there
whose
actions
are
accordant
with
our
religious
professions
of
london
we
have
no
data
on
this
point
illegitimate
births
seem
by
common
consent
of
most
writers
to
be
classed
with
details
of
prostitution
in
france
it
is
said
by
those
who
profess
intimate
local
knowledge
there
is
almost
a
prejudice
against
marriage
although
it
can
be
performed
as
a
legal
ceremony
we
think
bayle
john
states
this
fact
in
the
poorer
districts
of
london
the
east
end
for
example
it
is
notorious
that
numbers
live
in
a
state
of
concubinage
again
in
the
country
and
away
from
the
dense
population
of
towns
a
woman
of
immoral
habits
may
often
be
found
who
has
had
two
or
three
illegitimate
children
by
different
men
with
whom
she
has
cohabited
such
a
woman
would
most
probably
have
been
a
prostitute
in
a
town
as
it
is
she
is
no
better
still
she
is
not
a
prostitute
for
hire
but
to
proceed
to
details
the
number
of
illegitimate
births
in
every
thousand
births
in
the
various
counties
is
as
follows
cumberland
norfolk
hereford
salop
nottingham
cheshire
westmoreland
suffolk
derby
berks
leicester
north
wales
south
wales
york
stafford
sussex
cambridge
lincoln
middlesex
cumberland
is
a
pastoral
and
mountainous
county
with
a
population
norfolk
is
an
agricultural
and
grazing
county
broken
up
into
large
farms
neither
county
has
many
large
towns
stafford
is
a
manufacturing
county
with
a
long
list
of
small
towns
in
which
as
great
indigence
and
misery
can
be
found
as
in
any
part
of
england
middlesex
contains
london
here
then
we
see
at
once
that
illegitimacy
and
prostitution
are
not
the
same
thing
where
there
are
no
prostitutes
there
are
bastards
but
the
women
in
the
country
are
mostly
employed
they
are
obliged
to
work
in
the
fields
rough
country
labor
or
in
some
domestic
manufacture
such
as
etc
an
apparent
paradox
may
be
here
mentioned
although
not
intimately
affecting
these
investigations
the
preponderance
of
bastards
is
accompanied
by
a
preponderance
of
early
marriages
this
has
been
accounted
for
by
the
theory
that
both
are
dependent
on
sexual
instincts
precociously
or
excessively
stimulated
which
seek
marriage
when
practicable
or
illicit
intercourse
where
not
illegitimacy
is
somewhat
regulated
by
the
disproportionate
number
of
the
sexes
in
an
excess
of
females
there
are
few
bastards
in
an
excess
of
males
there
are
many
upon
this
fact
unattended
by
qualifying
circumstances
might
be
based
an
argument
as
to
the
innate
sexual
instinct
in
females
it
might
have
been
expected
the
relations
would
be
somewhat
different
namely
an
increase
of
prostitution
with
an
excess
of
men
but
an
increase
of
bastards
with
an
excess
of
women
the
number
of
rapes
in
england
seems
to
be
governed
by
the
excess
of
men
over
women
where
the
number
of
illegitimate
children
exceeds
the
average
rape
is
less
frequent
the
cases
of
abuse
of
children
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
twelve
are
three
in
every
ten
million
of
the
whole
population
there
is
some
difficulty
in
this
matter
arising
from
a
legal
technicality
on
the
subject
of
age
in
any
case
neither
of
the
last
items
of
criminality
is
of
any
value
inasmuch
as
they
include
only
those
cases
judicially
investigated
and
proved
to
conviction
many
are
guilty
yet
acquitted
and
many
more
are
never
charged
with
the
offense
shame
prevents
parties
prosecuting
or
in
the
case
of
children
the
fact
does
not
transpire
or
else
it
is
compromised
keeping
a
brothel
is
as
we
have
said
an
offense
at
common
law
we
have
a
computation
of
the
number
of
offenses
of
this
kind
based
upon
every
ten
million
of
the
population
in
middlesex
it
was
two
hundred
and
in
lancashire
one
hundred
and
both
counties
include
the
most
populous
towns
in
england
lancashire
contains
manchester
and
liverpool
this
fact
also
is
of
little
value
owing
to
the
peculiar
administration
of
the
law
on
the
subject
remote
or
indirect
injuries
to
the
public
safety
are
not
noticed
in
england
the
police
may
be
well
aware
of
crime
meditated
and
planned
and
of
the
haunts
of
crime
but
the
theory
of
public
justice
is
cure
not
prevention
concealment
of
birth
is
an
offense
which
as
it
emanates
from
undue
sexual
intercourse
is
generally
associated
with
prostitution
in
hereford
and
other
counties
the
proportion
of
illegitimate
births
is
out
of
every
thousand
born
and
there
were
concealments
to
every
thousand
bastards
in
four
counties
the
illegitimate
births
were
in
a
thousand
and
the
concealments
thirteen
in
a
thousand
illegitimates
in
fifteen
counties
there
were
illegitimates
in
every
thousand
births
and
concealments
to
every
thousand
illegitimates
with
the
largest
proportion
of
illegitimates
there
are
the
fewest
concealments
namely
with
illegitimates
out
of
a
thousand
births
there
were
only
twelve
concealments
to
a
thousand
illegitimates
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
ascertain
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
london
with
any
degree
of
certainty
and
even
a
satisfactory
approximation
is
exceedingly
difficult
nevertheless
it
is
most
important
to
attain
as
nearly
as
possible
to
the
actual
facts
because
without
this
knowledge
no
adequate
idea
can
be
formed
of
the
vast
of
disease
and
corruption
in
constant
action
in
a
great
capital
city
shedding
forth
and
disseminating
its
pernicious
growth
on
every
side
through
channels
unknown
and
unsuspected
colquhoun
a
magistrate
of
the
british
metropolis
toward
the
close
of
the
last
century
made
an
arbitrary
enumeration
fixing
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
london
at
fifty
thousand
drs
ryan
campbell
talbot
and
others
carry
their
estimate
in
to
eighty
thousand
mayne
now
sir
richard
mayne
chief
commissioner
of
the
metropolitan
police
in
made
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
regular
london
prostitutes
which
he
considers
were
then
eight
thousand
and
upward
the
seemingly
irreconcilable
discrepancy
of
these
numbers
is
no
doubt
to
be
found
in
the
loose
terminology
of
the
one
party
and
the
technicality
of
the
other
the
term
prostitute
would
seem
to
be
best
applied
to
those
unhappy
females
who
make
prostitution
their
sole
calling
and
may
therefore
be
styled
regular
prostitutes
while
the
larger
estimate
includes
all
shades
both
regular
and
occasional
or
irregular
by
which
is
understood
those
females
with
whom
prostitution
is
auxiliary
to
some
reputable
calling
we
can
not
find
that
any
reliable
or
detailed
returns
have
been
made
on
this
branch
of
public
life
by
the
london
police
although
they
must
possess
peculiar
and
exclusive
powers
of
preparing
them
as
long
back
as
the
following
rough
calculation
was
made
prostitutes
in
brothels
prostitutes
walking
the
streets
infesting
low
neighborhoods
on
this
return
mayne
very
probably
based
his
estimate
of
talbot
the
secretary
of
the
society
for
the
protection
of
young
females
made
the
subject
one
of
special
inquiry
both
personally
and
with
the
aid
of
the
local
police
of
the
different
cities
and
although
his
details
are
very
meagre
he
professes
to
have
satisfied
himself
of
the
general
accuracy
of
the
following
figures
showing
the
regular
prostitutes
in
various
cities
edinburgh
glasgow
liverpool
leeds
manchester
all
parties
are
however
agreed
in
representing
that
it
is
impracticable
to
form
any
thing
like
a
correct
estimate
of
the
number
of
female
servants
milliners
and
women
in
the
upper
and
middle
classes
of
society
who
might
properly
be
classed
with
prostitutes
or
of
the
women
who
frequent
theatres
barracks
ships
prisons
etc
in
the
police
of
dublin
published
in
their
statistical
returns
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
that
city
which
is
the
only
public
or
official
paper
on
the
point
having
any
appearance
of
system
or
accuracy
it
is
as
follows
brothels
prostitutes
this
table
shows
a
steady
decrease
in
the
number
of
these
women
we
are
uninformed
as
to
any
local
causes
for
this
nor
do
we
know
whether
it
has
been
balanced
by
an
increase
of
sly
or
occasional
prostitution
from
the
preceding
figures
a
calculation
has
been
made
of
the
regular
prostitutes
relatively
to
the
population
in
the
several
towns
it
appears
to
have
been
based
on
the
number
of
inhabitants
at
the
date
of
the
various
estimates
that
of
dublin
is
according
to
the
census
of
the
remainder
according
to
that
of
proportion
of
prostitutes
to
population
proportion
to
population
number
of
to
total
to
males
to
females
population
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to
the
mean
of
the
above
maybe
taken
as
a
fair
representation
of
the
general
state
of
the
kingdom
the
qualifying
circumstances
to
which
we
have
already
made
allusion
as
peculiar
to
each
city
or
district
are
of
course
neutralized
by
the
aggregate
for
example
liverpool
is
a
great
town
and
a
large
number
of
regular
prostitutes
would
be
inevitable
there
in
manchester
a
large
manufacturing
city
with
an
immense
pauper
and
factory
operative
population
the
trade
of
prostitution
would
meet
with
less
profitable
custom
accordingly
we
find
the
proportion
much
smaller
glasgow
is
both
manufacturing
and
commercial
there
again
the
proportion
is
larger
dublin
has
but
little
commerce
but
is
a
capital
city
and
has
a
court
and
a
large
garrison
the
combination
of
all
these
circumstances
is
found
in
london
and
a
fair
estimate
would
be
obtained
by
adding
all
the
preceding
proportions
together
which
would
give
a
mean
of
about
in
and
this
upon
the
population
is
within
a
fraction
of
ten
thousand
we
have
seen
that
mayne
in
stated
his
opinion
to
be
that
there
were
about
eight
thousand
regular
prostitutes
in
london
qualifying
that
statement
by
a
profession
of
total
ignorance
as
to
the
irregulars
who
did
not
make
prostitution
their
only
means
of
living
mayne
had
peculiar
sources
of
information
open
to
him
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
his
opinion
was
well
founded
from
the
above
calculation
from
the
best
sources
available
to
us
on
this
very
obscure
question
we
are
satisfied
to
assume
ten
thousand
as
at
least
a
probable
approximation
to
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
london
mayne
in
his
statement
on
this
subject
mentioned
that
there
were
brothels
some
authors
have
attempted
to
make
a
calculation
of
the
number
of
prostitutes
on
the
basis
of
this
number
of
houses
one
has
assumed
three
another
ten
wardlaw
has
fixed
upon
five
women
per
house
without
as
it
appears
to
us
any
precise
reason
for
preferring
that
figure
these
different
opinions
may
be
thus
worked
out
women
in
each
house
would
give
prostitutes
as
in
dublin
would
give
as
in
cork
we
have
not
been
able
to
obtain
mayne
statement
and
failing
that
we
may
be
in
error
but
we
should
be
inclined
to
think
that
in
his
official
capacity
as
a
magistrate
and
in
his
personal
character
as
a
lawyer
mayne
would
be
apt
to
assign
the
term
brothel
indiscriminately
to
all
houses
trading
in
prostitution
whether
houses
of
assignation
or
houses
in
which
prostitutes
habitually
reside
if
our
reading
of
the
word
brothels
in
this
sense
be
correct
it
is
clear
that
any
attempt
to
enumerate
on
the
basis
of
the
women
attached
to
each
house
would
be
fallacious
the
expression
used
by
the
dublin
police
is
houses
frequented
or
occupied
and
its
ambiguity
shows
that
the
authorities
there
considered
the
word
brothel
in
the
sense
given
to
it
by
english
jurists
how
does
this
number
of
ten
thousand
regular
prostitutes
bear
on
the
population
in
london
there
are
above
twenty
years
of
age
male
female
bachelors
spinsters
husbands
wives
widowers
widows
totals
omitting
fractions
the
proportions
would
be
on
bachelors
and
widowers
in
total
male
population
female
aggregate
population
above
twenty
years
of
age
this
would
establish
ten
thousand
as
the
nucleus
of
the
prostitution
system
of
london
those
females
who
come
within
the
designation
of
irregular
prostitutes
are
in
no
respect
less
prejudicial
to
the
community
than
the
regulars
the
difference
is
that
they
have
some
other
real
or
nominal
occupation
which
they
follow
according
to
circumstances
an
even
moderately
correct
estimate
of
their
number
is
little
better
than
and
we
therefore
think
it
expedient
to
put
our
readers
in
possession
of
our
own
limited
means
of
information
and
take
them
on
to
a
conclusion
there
are
so
many
elements
to
be
taken
into
the
account
and
the
data
are
so
scanty
that
we
only
consider
ourselves
justified
in
intimating
an
opinion
rather
than
announcing
a
satisfactory
conclusion
to
show
the
extremes
to
which
the
doctrine
of
possibilities
may
lead
in
this
development
of
misery
and
vice
we
will
recur
to
the
statement
of
some
of
the
london
prostitute
themselves
we
quote
from
mayhew
letters
to
the
morning
chronicle
i
now
come
to
the
second
test
that
was
adopted
in
order
to
verify
my
conclusions
this
was
the
convening
of
such
a
number
of
and
as
would
enable
me
to
arrive
at
a
correct
average
as
to
the
earnings
of
the
class
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
do
this
not
only
with
regard
to
the
more
respectable
portions
of
the
operatives
but
also
with
reference
to
those
who
i
had
been
given
to
understand
resorted
to
prostitution
in
order
to
eke
out
their
subsistence
i
consulted
a
friend
who
is
well
acquainted
with
the
habits
and
feelings
of
as
to
the
possibility
of
gathering
together
a
number
of
women
who
would
be
willing
to
state
that
they
had
been
forced
to
take
to
the
streets
on
account
of
the
low
prices
for
their
work
he
told
me
he
was
afraid
from
the
shame
of
their
mode
of
life
becoming
known
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
collect
together
a
number
of
females
who
would
be
ready
to
say
as
much
publicly
however
it
was
decided
that
at
least
the
experiment
should
be
made
and
that
every
thing
should
be
done
to
assure
the
parties
of
the
strict
privacy
of
the
assemblage
it
was
arranged
that
this
gentleman
and
myself
should
be
the
only
male
persons
visible
on
the
occasion
and
that
the
place
of
meeting
should
be
as
dimly
lighted
as
possible
so
they
could
scarcely
see
or
be
seen
by
one
another
or
by
us
cards
of
admission
were
issued
privately
and
to
my
astonishment
as
many
as
came
on
the
evening
named
to
the
appointed
place
intent
upon
making
known
the
sorrows
and
sufferings
that
had
driven
them
to
fly
to
the
streets
in
order
to
get
the
bread
which
the
wretched
prices
paid
for
their
labor
would
not
permit
them
to
obtain
never
in
all
history
was
such
a
sight
seen
or
such
tales
heard
there
in
the
dim
haze
of
the
large
bare
room
in
which
they
met
sat
women
and
girls
some
with
babies
sucking
at
their
breasts
others
in
rags
and
even
those
borrowed
in
order
that
they
might
come
and
tell
their
misery
to
the
world
i
have
witnessed
many
a
scene
of
sorrow
lately
i
have
heard
stories
that
have
unmanned
me
but
never
till
last
wednesday
had
i
heard
or
seen
any
thing
so
solemn
so
terrible
as
this
if
ever
eloquence
was
listened
to
it
was
in
the
outpourings
of
these
poor
lorn
mothers
hearts
for
their
little
ones
as
each
told
her
woes
and
struggles
and
published
her
shame
amid
the
convulsive
sobs
of
others
nay
of
all
present
behind
a
screen
removed
from
sight
so
as
not
to
wound
the
modesty
of
the
women
who
were
nevertheless
aware
of
their
presence
sat
two
reporters
from
this
journal
to
take
down
the
confessions
and
declarations
of
those
assembled
and
to
them
i
am
indebted
for
the
following
report
of
the
statements
made
at
the
meeting
then
follow
a
series
of
most
statements
all
to
the
same
purport
as
those
quoted
in
other
parts
of
this
work
and
bearing
all
the
internal
evidence
of
truth
the
letter
concludes
with
the
following
sentence
they
were
unanimous
in
declaring
that
a
large
number
of
the
trade
probably
one
fourth
of
the
whole
or
one
half
of
those
who
had
no
husbands
or
parents
to
support
them
resorted
to
the
streets
to
eke
out
a
living
accordingly
assuming
the
government
returns
to
be
correct
and
that
there
are
upward
of
eleven
thousand
females
under
twenty
living
by
needle
and
slop
work
the
numerical
amount
of
prostitution
becomes
awful
to
contemplate
thus
then
we
have
it
in
evidence
that
probably
one
fourth
of
all
women
engaged
in
sewing
occupations
for
a
livelihood
are
compelled
to
have
occasional
recourse
to
prostitution
as
their
only
and
compulsory
refuge
from
starvation
the
number
of
women
engaged
in
these
sewing
occupations
is
enormous
according
to
the
census
of
they
constitute
indeed
the
main
support
of
the
female
working
population
throughout
great
britain
exclusive
of
domestic
servants
laundresses
and
persons
employed
in
agricultural
pursuits
and
in
the
cotton
and
linen
factories
the
figures
for
the
three
kingdoms
are
as
follows
hatters
furriers
tailors
milliners
seamstresses
glovers
in
all
great
britain
this
class
numbers
of
whom
there
are
under
twenty
years
of
age
we
have
not
the
details
of
the
occupations
of
london
but
the
proportion
which
the
population
of
the
metropolis
bears
to
that
of
great
britain
is
about
one
ninth
one
ninth
of
the
above
aggregate
would
give
for
london
about
women
engaged
in
the
sewing
trades
all
of
whom
it
may
be
assumed
are
over
fifteen
we
omit
from
the
consideration
of
female
trades
those
engaged
in
agricultural
pursuits
and
factories
such
occupations
having
comparatively
few
representatives
in
the
metropolitan
districts
although
there
are
more
of
them
than
would
be
supposed
laundresses
are
also
omitted
as
a
very
large
proportion
of
them
in
and
about
london
are
as
is
well
known
married
and
women
but
another
class
to
which
all
writers
assign
a
large
amount
of
prostitution
are
domestic
servants
a
body
most
numerously
represented
in
london
there
are
in
the
metropolis
domestic
servants
the
peculiarly
unprotected
character
of
whom
as
a
class
may
be
inferred
from
the
singular
fact
that
to
the
the
hospital
and
the
lunatic
asylum
they
supply
an
immense
number
of
inmates
exceeding
that
of
any
other
class
thus
then
are
shown
two
very
large
figures
amounting
together
to
as
the
stock
from
which
prostitutes
to
any
extent
may
be
procured
some
consideration
perhaps
of
the
ages
of
prostitutes
and
of
other
circumstances
in
the
condition
of
the
female
population
may
enable
us
to
appreciate
the
state
of
the
case
without
being
driven
to
the
necessity
of
looking
on
these
enormous
totals
as
incapable
of
reduction
nature
would
indicate
the
period
between
and
as
the
age
during
which
the
trade
of
prostitution
must
be
carried
on
much
has
been
said
as
to
the
means
used
for
decoying
young
children
for
purposes
of
prostitution
of
the
fact
we
are
perfectly
convinced
but
should
think
it
of
little
numerical
importance
in
the
aggregate
body
the
influence
of
evil
communication
on
the
young
is
of
infinitely
greater
mischief
and
the
extent
of
youthful
depravity
from
this
cause
is
very
great
among
the
poorer
classes
and
would
oblige
us
to
date
the
commencing
age
of
prostitution
back
to
twelve
years
as
to
the
period
of
life
at
which
the
prostitute
career
is
terminated
it
is
contended
by
some
of
the
english
writers

tait
says
in
less
than
one
year
from
the
commencement
of
their
wicked
career
these
females
bear
evident
marks
of
their
approaching
decay
and
in
the
course
of
three
years
very
few
can
be
recognized
by
their
old
acquaintance
if
they
are
so
fortunate
as
to
survive
that
period
these
remarks
apply
more
especially
to
those
who
are
above
twenty
years
of
age
when
they
join
the
ranks
of
the
victims
from
the
average
of
edinburgh
tait
goes
on
to
assume
that
not
above
one
in
eleven
survives
years
of
age
and
taking
together
those
who
persist
in
vice
and
those
who
after
having
abandoned
it
die
of
diseases
which
originated
from
the
excesses
they
were
addicted
to
during
its
continuance
perhaps
not
less
than
a
fifth
or
sixth
of
all
who
have
embraced
this
course

annually
ryan
seems
to
adopt
an
opinion
that
the
average
duration
of
life
after
commencing
prostitution
is
four
years
captain
miller
of
glasgow
thinks
that
the
average
age
at
which
women
become
abandoned
is
from
fifteen
to
twenty
and
the
average
duration
of
women
continuing
this
vice
is
about
five
years
the
ages
of
patients
admitted
into
the
lock
hospital
at
edinburgh
were
as
follows
under
years
from
years
to
years
over
years
total
these
figures
alone
would
go
to
make
out
the
presumption
that
the
ages
of
prostitutes
are
between
twelve
and
thirty
and
that
are
between
fifteen
and
according
to
the
above
table
nine
tenths
of
the
number
at
twenty
have
disappeared
at
thirty
and
according
to
captain
miller
opinion
that
cases
of
reform
and
abandonment
of
their
life
are
very
rare
the
conclusion
would
be
that
their
career
ends
in
death
the
duration
of
prostitution
being
ascertained
we
would
find
the
number
of
women
between
the
ages
of
fifteen
and
in
the
whole
female
population
this
is
one
fifth
but
the
very
aged
or
the
very
youthful
are
necessarily
excluded
from
the
classes
of
and
servants
of
servants
indeed
there
are
five
and
upward
under
twenty
to
three
above
twenty
years
of
age
this
therefore
would
indicate
very
little
reduction
of
the
numbers
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
some
portion
of
the
above
are
married
women
having
husbands
living
and
if
so
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
supposition
that
their
wives
are
not
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
prostitution
in
fact
the
poor
creatures
themselves
seem
to
imply
that
immunity
the
number
of
wives
is
about
one
third
of
the
whole
female
population
of
these
wives
about
one
fourth
are
employed
in
trades
apart
from
those
of
their
husbands
if
we
deduct
only
such
a
proportion
from
the
it
makes
something
when
we
have
to
deal
with
such
enormous
masses
we
should
strike
off
nearly
leaving
only
there
is
comfort
however
in
the
fact
that
of
these
three
fourths
are
known
to
be
over
twenty
years
of
age
and
if
we
only
assume
one
half
instead
of
three
fourths
allowing
the
other
fourth
for
the
difference
between
twenty
and
years
of
age
it
brings
our
figure
down
to
thousand
all
these
deductions
are
we
fear
in
excess
and
it
must
be
recollected
moreover
that
the
above
large
sums
by
no
means
include
all
the
female
occupations
of
london
but
merely
those
classes
which
either
from
the
temptation
incident
to
their
position
or
from
the
imperative
demands
of
want
and
necessity
are
by
competent
authority
supposed
to
be
peculiarly
obnoxious
to
the
risk
of
prostitution
if
to
this
large
number
of
women
which
we
can
not
assume
at
less
than
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
be
added
all
the
other
denizens
of
a
great
city
unexampled
in
its
magnitude
embracing
in
itself
all
the
peculiarities
of
all
other
cities
at
once
a
manufacturing
a
commercial
a
garrison
and
a
capital
city
and
finally
containing
the
largest
population
in
the
world
one
such
item
being
nearly
four
hundred
thousand
single
females
over
twelve
years
of
age
then
indeed
the
mass
of
misery
wretchedness
vice
and
crime
there
accumulated
appals
the
mind
seeking
to
grapple
with
it
and
oppresses
us
with
the
apprehension
that
even
eighty
thousand
the
highest
estimate
which
has
been
made
is
when
understood
to
include
all
contingencies
not
an
incredible
figure
englishmen
pride
themselves
and
it
must
be
admitted
not
without
reason
on
their
numerous
and
admirable
public
charities
in
this
particular
direction
it
would
seem
that
public
munificence
has
not
been
so
liberally
displayed
as
in
some
others
joy
shall
be
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
more
than
over
ninety

nine
just
persons

not

fear

to
minds
and
hearts
of
earthly
mould
people
in
charitable
as
in
other
institutions
like
to
see
a
return
for
their
investment
and
notwithstanding
the
immense
field
for
benevolent
labor
in
prostitution
there
is
a
general
impression
among
both
the
public
and
officials
that
it
is
an
irretrievably
barren
waste
and
that
it
is
worse
than
profitless
to
squander
money
and
time
upon
it
the
results
which
have
been
achieved
would
however
show
that
the
exertions
of
philanthropy
although
not
producing
so
much
fruit
as
in
some
other
quarters
have
not
been
entirely
vain
in
reference
to
these
results
too
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
discipline
of
the
various
institutions
is
severe
and
even
repellent

policy
ill
adapted

insure
a

of
success

course

gone
through

shattered
fabric
failed
at
the
enormous
extent
of
this
evil
its
causes
the
difficulty
of
combating
it
either
by
religious
arguments
legislative
provisions
or
appeals
to
common
sense
and
physical
welfare
may
well
deter
the
philanthropist
from
the
attempt
to
purify
this
stable
of
augeas
but
benevolence
has
accomplished
tasks
as
arduous
and
we
can
not
conclude
this
chapter
better
than
by
a
short
description
of
the
discouragements
which
attended
the
first
efforts
of
fry
in
the
reformation
of
the
prostitute
felons
in
newgate
and
of
the
blessed
results
of
her
indomitable
perseverance
and
immovable
faith
this
admirable
woman
on
her
first
visit
to
newgate
found
the
female
side
of
the
jail
in
a
condition
which
no
language
can
describe
nearly
three
hundred
women
sent
there
for
every
gradation
of
crime
and
some
under
sentence
of
death
were
crowded
together
in
two
small
wards
and
two
cells
they
all
slept
as
well
as
a
crowd
of
children
on
the
floor
at
times
one
hundred
and
twenty
in
a
ward
without
even
a
mat
for
bedding
many
of
them
were
nearly
naked
they
were
all
drunk
and
her
ears
were
offended
by
the
most
terrible
imprecations
the
authorities
of
the
prison
of
course
advised
her
against
going
among
them
were
sure
that
nothing
could
be
she
however
determined
to
make
the
trial
she
went
alone
into
what
she
felt
was
like
a
den
of
wild
beasts
in
vain
the
governor
reasoned
with
her
she
had
put
her
hand
to
the
plow
and
was
not
to
be
turned
back
in
one
short
month
such
was
the
effect
of
her
merely
and
religious
instruction
that
she
felt
herself
justified
in
inviting
the
the
sheriffs
and
several
of
the
aldermen
to
satisfy
themselves
by
personal
investigation
of
the
result
of
the
exertions
which
she
herself
and
some
few
lady
members
of
the
society
of
friends
who
had
joined
her
in
the
good
work
had
effected
thus
was
conviction
forced
upon
the
obtuse
intellects
of
corporate
authorities
and
hence
was
dated
the
era
of
prison
reform
in
england
in
our
own
country
where
the
means
of
diffusing
intelligence
are
unbounded
and
whose
reformatory
system
for
criminals
has
already
claimed
the
attention
of
european
statesmen
and
philanthropists
there
can
be
no
insuperable
barrier
even
in
so
difficult
an
undertaking
as
that
to
which
our
labors
are
directed
paraphrasing
the
opinion
of
one
of
the
most
distinguished
essayists
of
this
century
we
venture
to
assert
that
it
is
impossible
that
social
abuses
should
be
suffered
to
exist
in
this
country
and
in
this
stage
of
society
for
many
years
after
their
mischief
and
iniquity
have
been
made
manifest

the
sense
of

the
best
english
and
french
writers
are
of
opinion
that
syphilis
as
it
exists
at
present
has
in
some
shape
or
another
always
existed
among
mankind
although
it
was
not
known
to
science
or
history
in
a
distinct
manner
until
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
period
at
which
syphilis
first
made
its
appearance
in
england
is
involved
in
obscurity
but
we
know
that
it
began
to
attract
attention
early
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
first
official
recognition
of
it
found
on
record
is
a
police
regulation
of
the
year
during
the
reign
of
henry
excluding
venereal
patients
from
the
london
hospitals
and
requiring
them
to
be
strictly
guarded
at
night
in
the
time
of
henry
viii
there
were
six
lazar
houses
in
london
for
the
reception
of
venereal
patients
namely
at
knightsbridge
hammersmith
highgate
kingsland
george
gate
and
these
localities
were
doubtless
fixed
upon
as
being
some
distance
from
the
city
that
the
disease
however
must
have
been
known
long
before
the
period
above
specified
is
certain
from
passages
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
the
previous
century
john
of
gaddesden
who
wrote
in
and
who
was
a
fellow
of
merton
college
oxford
thus
speaks
of
the
possibility
of
contracting
the
disease
from
leprous
women

wm

upon
whose
pages
as
an
english
standard
writer
on
this
subject
we
draw
largely
is
of
opinion
that
leprosy
which
was
formerly
so
common
in
europe
consisted
merely
of
what
we
now
call
secondary
syphilis
some
of
the
jewish
observances
were
no
doubt
dictated
by
a
scientific
appreciation
of
the
influences
which
predisposed
the
body
to
the
effects
of
syphilitic
virus
the
practice
of
circumcision
seems
instituted
with
a
direct
view
to
the
preservation
of
the
chosen
people
from
venereal
contagion
to
which
in
a
hot
climate
and
with
the
extreme
deficiency
of
means
for
general
cleanliness
they
would
be
liable
as
to
the
type
of
the
disease
in
former
times
there
seems
no
ground
for
believing
that
it
was
more
severe
than
at
present
while
its
numerical
importance
must
have
been
much
smaller
the
following
extract
is
from
a
treatise
by
queen
elizabeth
surgeon
if
i
be
not
deceived
in
my
opinion
i
suppose
the
disease
itself
was
never
more
rife
in
naples
italie
france
or
spain
than
it
is
in
this
day
in
the
realme
of
england
i
may
speak
boldly
because
i
speak
truly
and
yet
i
speake
it
with
grief
of
minde
that
in
the
hospital
of
bartholomew
in
london
there
hath
been
cured
of
this
disease
by
me
and
three
others
within
five
years

the
number
of
one
thousand
and
more
i
speak
nothing
of

and
other
houses
about
the
citie
wherein
an
infinite
number
are
daily
cured
it
happened
very
seldom
in

i
staid
there
among
every
twenty
diseased
that
were
taken
into
the
said
house

was
most
commonly
on
the
monday
ten
of
them
were
infected
with
the
it
was
supposed
in
former
ages
that
syphilis
was
transmissible
by
personal
communication
touching
the
clothes
drinking
out
of
the
same
vessels
or
even
breathing
the
same
air
with
infected
persons
and
accordingly
we
find
the
lower
orders
of
people
driven
out
into
the
fields
to
die
and
physicians
refusing
to
attend
the
sick
for
fear
of
infection
some
writers
indeed
doubted
this
kind
of
contagious
influence
and
held
that
it
required
intercourse
or
at
least
contact
but
nobles
and
especially
the
clergy
preferred
to
ascribe
their
maladies
to
misfortune
rather
than
to
licentiousness
and
sought
to
put
down
such
innovating
doctrines
the
consequence
was
that
patients
were
shunned
universally
and
left
to
die
or
get
well
without
assistance
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
therefore
that
in
numerous
instances
the
disease
should
assume
its
most
inveterate
aspect
and
hence
the
notices
found
among
many
old
writers
as
to
the
supposed
malignancy
and
incurability
of
what
they
were
disposed
to
consider
a
malady
that
the
disease
in
reality
differed
little
from
that
which
exists
in
our
day
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
cases
of
the
once
formidable
black
lion
are
occasionally
to
be
met
with
in
the
london
hospitals

a
remnant
of

barbarous
system
was
retained
in
the
regulations
of
middlesex
hospital
london
by
which
an
admission
fee
of
forty
shillings
sterling
ten
dollars
was
directed
to
be
paid
by
venereal
patients
the
reason
assigned
for
it
was
that
a
hospital
intended
for
the
virtuous
might
not
be
made
subsidiary
to
purposes
of
vice
the
regulation
however
became
a
nullity
and
was
repealed
owing
principally
to
the
fact
that
the
guardians
were
in
the
habit
of
paying
the
forty
shillings
and
sending
in
pauper
patients
well
knowing
that
the
cost
of
cure
in
the
would
far
exceed
the
admission
fees
in

similar
regulation
exists
even

is

evaded

medical
foundations
put
aside
and
their

thrown
into
the

of

we
should
have

suppose
the
private
practice
of

to
yield
only

have

without

one
would
very
readily
imagine
that
london
alone
furnished
venereal

per

again
on
the
number
of
single
men
and
widowers
in

above
twenty
years
of
age
upward
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
the
venereal
cases
if
in
the
same
proportion
as
among
soldiers
and
sailors
would
in
the
same
period
amount
to
and
upward
there
is
however
another
way
of
conjecturing
the
amount
of
disease
introduced
into
the
community
by
prostitution
which
english
writers
have
adopted
the
review
a
periodical
of
high
standing
speaking
of
the
extent
of
venereal
disease
and
its
effects
on
the
population
says
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
to
represent
the
public
prostitutes
of
england
wales
and
scotland
fifty
thousand
is
an
estimate
too
low
we
presume
there
will
be
no
objection
made
to
the
assumption
that
unless
each
of
these
fifty
thousand
prostitutes
submitted
to
at
least
one
act
of
intercourse
during
every
hours
she
could
not
obtain
means
sufficient
to
support
life
the
result
of
the
evidence
contained
in
the
first
report
of
the
constabulary
force
of
england
was
that
about
two
per
cent
of
the
prostitutes
of
london
were
suffering
under
some
form
of
venereal
disease
but
yet
we
will
descend
even
lower
and
presume
that
of
one
hundred
healthy
prostitutes
if
each
submits
to
one
indiscriminate
sexual
act
in
hours
not
more
than
one
would
become
infected
with
syphilis
an
estimate
which
is
without
doubt
far
too
low
yet
if
admitted
to
be
correct
the
necessary
consequence
will
be
that
of
the
fifty
thousand
prostitutes
five
hundred
are
diseased
within
the
aforesaid
hours
if
we
next
admit
that
a
fifth
of
these
five
hundred
diseased
women
are
admitted
to
hospitals
on
the
day
on
which
disease
appears
it
follows
there
are
every
day
on
the
streets
four
hundred
diseased
women
let
it
be
supposed
that
the
power
of
these
four
hundred
to
infect
be
limited
to
twelve
days
and
that
of
every
six
persons
who
at
the
rate
of
one
each
night
have
connection
with
these
women
five
become
infected
it
will
follow
that
will
be
four
thousand
men
infected
every
night
and
consequently
one
million
four
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
in
the
farther
as
there
are
every
night
four
hundred
women
diseased
by
these
men
one
hundred
and
thousand
five
hundred
public
prostitutes
will
be
syphilized
during
the
year
and
hence
million
six
hundred
and
thousand
five
hundred
cases
of
syphilis
in
both
sexes
occur
every
twelve
if
then
the
entire
population
had
intercourse
with
prostitutes
in
an
equal
ratio
the
gross
population
of
great
britain
of
all
ages
and
sexes
would
during
eighteen
years
have
been
affected
with
primary
syphilis
be
it
remembered
we
do
not
assert
that
more
than
a
million
and
a
half
of
persons
are
attacked
every
year
but
that
that
number
of
cases
occur
annually
in
england
wales
and
scotland
though
the
same
individual
may
be
attacked
more
than
once
although
it
is
evident
that
all
the
estimates
used
for
these
calculations
are
we
know
no
other
word
that
expresses
it
ridiculously
low
yet
we
find
that
more
than
a
million
and
a
half
cases
of
syphilis
occur
every
year
an
amount
which
is
probably
not
half
the
actual
number
how
enormous
then
must
be
the
number
of
children
born
with
secondary
syphilis
how
immense
the
mortality
among
them
how
vast
an
amount
of
public
and
private
money
expended
in
the
cure
of
this
disease

of

the
cuna
or

the
social
condition
of
mexico
is
of
importance
as
it
was
formerly
the
chief
seat
of
spanish
domination
in
america
and
its
manners
and
government
gave
the
key
to
all
the
other
colonies
and
viceroyalties
which
owed
allegiance
to
the
crown
of
spain
whatever
the
state
of
the
native
population
may
have
been
when
spanish
leaders
and
their
myrmidons
burst
upon
them
and
broke
up
the
kingdom
of
the
mexican
emperors
they
rapidly
succumbed
beneath
the
lust
avarice
and
cruelty
which
were
ever
the
distinctive
features
of
spanish
warfare
and
conquest
in
every
clime
and
against
every
people
of
the
enormities
perpetrated
by
these
soldiers
the
history
of
the
mexican
conquest
gives
us
innumerable
instances
but
one
solitary
example
from
bernal
de
diaz
will
be
enough
he
tells
us
that
when
they
took
women
prisoners
they
made
a
division
of
them
at
night
for
the
sake
of
greater
peace
and
quietness
and
that
they
branded
them
with
the
marks
of
their
owners
they
were
thus
at
liberty
to
choose
the
handsomest
of
the
indian
women
and
reserve
them
for
their
own
uses
what
these
uses
were
can
be
easily
supposed
the
fate
of
less
favored
female
prisoners
is
left
in
doubt
they
were
turned
over
to
their
savage
allies
to
be
butchered
in
cold
blood
or
otherwise
disposed
of
as
most
convenient
from
mexico
the
flood
of
spanish
cruelty
and
immorality
spread
itself
like
a
stream
of
lava
over
the
whole
of
south
america
the
chivalry
of
the
soldiery
soon
degenerated
and
the
and
lofty
motives
darkened
though
they
were
by
bigotry
and
cruelty
in
some
cases
which
had
distinguished
the
priests
were
lost
inglorious
ease
and
luxurious
indolence
now
superseded
that
love
of
adventure
and
unconquerable
daring
which
distinguished
cortez
and
pizarro
and
their
comrades
no
trace
of
the
old
heroic
character
remained
save
the
grinding
oppression
and
reckless
selfishness
which
usually
accompany
ambition
an
illustration
of
the
loose
manners
which
prevailed
in
mexico
among
the
clergy
is
to
be
found
in
the
voyages
of
thomas
page
a
dominican
monk
who
visited
mexico
with
some
of
his
order
on
their
road
to
the
western
coast
of
america
and
to
asia
as
missionaries
from
this
work
published
in
we
learn
that
the
writer
and
his
companions
visited
the
prior
of
vera
cruz
on
their
journey
and
after
a
sumptuous
dinner
adjourned
by
invitation
to
his
cell
they
found
it
richly
tapestried
and
adorned
with
feathers
of
the
birds
of
michoacou
the
walls
were
hung
with
various
pictures
of
merit
rich
rugs
of
silk
covered
the
tables
porcelain
of
china
filled
the
cupboards
and
sideboards
and
there
were
vases
and
bowls
containing
preserved
fruits
and
sweetmeats
my
companions
says
he
were
scandalized
by
such
an
exhibition
the
holy
friar
talked
to
us
of
his
ancestry
of
his
good
parts
of
the
influence
he
had
with
the
father
provincial
of
the
love
the
principal
ladies
of
the
place
bore
him
of
his
beautiful
voice
and
skill
in
music
he
took
his
guitar
and
sang
us
a
sonnet
in
praise
of
a
certain
lady
afterward
speaking
of
the
franciscans
of
jalapa
thomas
page
says
their
lives
are
so
free
and
immodest
that
it
might
be
suspected
with
reason
that
they
had
renounced
only
that
which
they
could
not
obtain
after
witnessing
a
gambling
scene
in
a
convent
he
concludes
that
the
cause
of
so
many
friars
and
jesuits
passing
from
spain
to
regions
so
distant
was
libertinage
rather
than
love
of
preaching
the
gospel
the
same
writer
subsequently
passes
from
portraiture
to
more
general
delineation
and
thus
depicts
the
body
of
the
clergy
it
seems
that
all
wickedness
is
allowable
so
that
the
churches
and
clergy
flourish
nay
while
the
purse
is
open
to
lasciviousness
if
it
be
also
open
to
enrich
the
temple
walls
and
roof
it
is
better
than
any
holy
water
in
their
lifetime
the
mexicans
strive
to
excel
one
another
in
their
gifts
to
the
cloisters
of
nuns
and
friars
among
the
benefactors
was
one
alonzo
cuellar
so
rich
that
he
was
reported
to
have
a
closet
in
his
house
laid
with
bars
of
gold
instead
of
bricks
this
man
built
a
nunnery
for
franciscan
nuns
which
cost
him
thirty
thousand
ducats
and
left
to
it
two
thousand
dollars
yearly
and
yet
his
life
was
so
scandalous
that
commonly
in
the
night
with
two
servants
he
would
go
round
the
city
visiting
scandalous
persons
and
at
every
house
letting
fall
a
bead
and
tying
a
knot
that
when
he
came
home
in
the
morning
he
might
number
by
his
beads
the
uncivil
stations
he
had
visited
that
night
great
alms
and
liberality
toward
religious
houses
are
coupled
with
great
and
scandalous
wickedness
they
wallow
in
the
bed
of
riches
and
wealth
and
make
their
alms
the
coverlet
to
conceal
their
loose
and
lascivious
lives
i
will
not
speak
much
of
the
lives
of
the
friars
and
nuns
of
this
city
but
only
that
they
enjoy
there
more
liberty
than
in
europe
where
they
have
too
much
and
that
surely
the
scandals
committed
by
them
do
cry
up
to
heaven
for
vengeance
judgment
and
destruction
it
is
ordinary
for
the
friars
to
visit
their
devoted
nuns
and
to
spend
whole
days
with
them
hearing
their
music
and
feeding
on
their
sweetmeats
for
this
purpose
they
have
many
chambers
which
they
call
loquatories
to
talk
in
with
wooden
bars
between
the
nuns
and
them
and
in
these
chambers
are
tables
for
the
friars
to
dine
at
and
while
they
dine
the
nuns
recreate
them
with
their
voices
we
need
no
addition
to
these
deep
shadows
from
the
dark
pencil
of
so
vigorous
a
limner
as
worthy
thomas
page
to
delineate
character
nearly
two
hundred
years
ago
but
we
can
scarcely
believe
it
equally
applicable
to
the
present
day
the
reign
of
oppression
in
mexico
it
is
to
be
hoped
is
approaching
its
end
and
recent
events
have
shown
that
the
population
is
alive
to
some
of
those
truths
which
were
long
ago
patent
to
all
the
world
except
those
most
intimately
concerned
of
modern
mexican
society
an
accomplished
female
writer
who
had
the
best
opportunities
of
judging
says
it
is
long
before
a
stranger
even
suspects
the
state
of
morals
in
this
country
for
whatever
be
the
private
conduct
of
individuals
the
most
perfect
decorum
prevails
in
outward
behavior
but
indolence
is
the
mother
of
vice
they
rarely
gossip
to
strangers
about
their
neighbors
faults
habit
has
rendered
them
tolerably
indifferent
as
to
the
subsisting
among
particular
friends
and
as
long
as
a
woman
attends
church
regularly
is
a
patroness
of
charitable
institutions
and
gives
no
scandal
by
her
outward
behavior
she
may
do
pretty
much
as
she
pleases
as
for
flirtations
in
public
they
are
unknown
the
present
amiability
of
the
mexican
ladies
is
admitted
on
all
hands
as
is
the
genial
warmth
of
their
manner
some
travelers
indeed
and
among
them
waddy
thompson
are
of
opinion
that
this
is
attributed
to
them
as
a
fault
and
that
the
reproach
of
unchastity
is
unjustly
urged
against
them
as
there
is
no
city
in
europe
where
there
is
less
immorality
the
constant
presence
of
a
duenna
and
the
who
is
an
appurtenance
of
every
household
of
respectability
are
excellent
checks
on
immorality
but
this
would
rather
argue
the
necessity
of
a
safeguard
not
found
in
the
female
virtue
of
mexico
besides
these
appendages
of
rank
have
lost
their
real
meaning
and
the
duenna
may
be
converted
into
the
convenient
cloak
or
abettor
of
an
intrigue
the
more
safe
as
she
is
the
supposed
protectress
of
the
husband
honor
a
native
writer
in
summing
up
the
character
of
his
countrymen
says
that
they
are
moderate
in
eating
but
their
passion
for
liquor
is
carried
to
the
greatest
excess
the
affection
which
husbands
bear
their
wives
is
certainly
much
less
than
that
borne
by
wives
to
their
husbands
and
is
very
common
for
the
men
to
love
their
neighbors
wives
better
than
their
this
censure
presupposes
as
a
necessary
consequence
that
the
neighbors
wives
must
show
some
reciprocity
the
general
immorality
of
the
lower
classes
in
mexico
would
almost
exclude
the
expectation
of
a
system
of
prostitution
as
we
usually
understand
the
term
puebla
a
manufacturing
town
near
mexico
is
summarily
described
as
having
a
most
devout
female
population
and
a
most
abandoned
one
but
this
is
matter
of
conduct
rather
than
of
calling
the
enumeration
of
offenses
in
the
justice
list
of
mexico
does
not
tell
of
one
prostitute
although
it
contains
a
large
number
of
persons
guilty
of
incontinence
the
exact
meaning
of
this
offense
in
its
legal
and
technical
sense
is
not
given
us
but
we
presume
it
relates
to
improper
and
disgusting
practices
the
charge
of
violation
of
public
decency
although
it
may
relate
to
mutual
familiarities
will
probably
include
both
indecency
and
immorality

the

on
this
particular
some
writers
are
of
opinion
that
what
was
written
in
will
apply
with
almost
equal
force
in
the
present
day
a
position
certainly
open
to
doubt
the
lower
orders
of
the
priests
and
friars
in
mexico
are
generally
uneducated
and
frequently
licentious
the
most
revolting
spectacles
of
vice
and
immorality
are
exhibited
by
some
of
them
they
are
remarkable
for
the
appearance
they
present
but
they
can
not
be
considered
types
of
the
class
for
the
higher
orders
and
respectable
members
of
the
priesthood
are
exempt
from
the
imputation
of
such
flagrant
immorality
even
these
are
not
blameless
members
of
the
church
many
of
them
have
nephews
and
nieces
in
their
houses

at
least
those
who
call
them
uncle
but
to
whom
scandal
ascribes
a
closer
relationship
among
the
charitable
institutions
in
mexico
perhaps
the
most
important
is
the

it
is
supported
by
private
individuals
and
the

of

has
been
about
a
month
in
the
hospital
it
is
sent
with
an
indian
nurse
to
one
of
the
adjacent
villages
but
if
sick
or
feeble
it
remains
in
the
institution
under
the
immediate
inspection
of
the
society
these
nurses
are
subject
to
a
responsible
person
who
lives
in
the
village
and
answers
for
their
good
conduct
the
child
is
brought
back
to
the
hospital
when
weaned
and
remains
in
its
charge
for
life
few
however
are
left
to
grow
up
in
the

they
are
adopted
by
respectable
persons
who
bring
them
up
either
as

as
their

in

the
natives
far
outnumbered
their

and
the
same
ruthless

was
extended
to

as
to

the
consequence
was
that
before
the
lapse
of
many
generations
from

conquest
there
were
but
two
classes
throughout
the
vast
spanish

could
not

the

a
state

reigned
supreme

paralleled
by
the
debasement
of
its

in

including
san

guatemala
yucatan
costa

and
honduras
the
condition
of
the

is
very
much
the

as
in

the
statements
of
travelers
in
those
regions
are
very
vague
in
reference
to
the
subject
of
public
morality
and
give
us
no
reliable
or
detailed
information
on
the
specialities
which
would
be
of
service
in
this
inquiry
in
yucatan
the
ladies
are
said
to
be
somewhat
more
domesticated
than
their
mexican
neighbors
and
to
interest
themselves
in
the
management
of
their
households
and
the
education
of
their

but
still
the
standard
of
morality
is
not
very
high
if
measured
by
united

habits
and
ideas
in
the
neighboring
republic
of
guatemala
the
free
manners
prevalent
in
the
country
districts
of
the
kindred
territories
are
usually
met
with
but
these
would
rather
indicate
low
ideas
of
decency
than
any
actual
immorality
difference
of
climate
and
of
race
would
make
many
things
tolerable
or
even
reputable
which
our
colder
skies
and
more
rigid
notions
would
totally
exclude
from
the
observances
of
civilized
society
the
indian
populations
of
south
america
have
become
so
completely
slaves
during
long
years
of
bondage
that
they
have
lost
their
prominent
characteristics
and
are
but
a
reflex
of
their
masters
in
the
lowest
state
of
ignorance
the
women
may
be
generally
described
as
of
very
loose
morals
yet
kind
and
gentle
unless
roused
by
jealousy
in
which
case
they
can
use
the
knife
as
promptly
as
their
male
friends
it
is
said
they
make
very
affectionate
mothers
there
are
a
few
tribes
who
have
preserved
some
semblance
of
nationality
the
caribs
of
honduras
are
a
hardy
and
athletic
race
polygamy
is
general
among
them
three
or
four
wives
being
a
not
uncommon
number
the
husband
is
compelled
to
have
a
separate
house
and
plantation
for
each
and
if
he
make
one
a
present
he
must
give
the
others
something
of
equal
value
he
must
also
divide
his
time
among
them
giving
a
week
to
each
in
succession
when
a
carib
takes
a
wife
he
fells
a
plantation
and
builds
a
house
the
wife
then
takes
the
management
and
he
becomes
a
gentleman
the
women
attend
their
plantations
with
great
care
and
in
the
course
of
twelve
or
fifteen
months
have
every
description
of
breadstuff
under
cultivation
about
christmas
they
engage
several
creers
and
freight
them
with
produce
for
truxillo
and
belize
hiring
their
husbands
and
others
as
sailors
it
is
also
the
custom
when
a
woman
can
not
do
all
the
work
required
on
her
plantation
for
her
to
engage
her
husband
as
a
laborer
and
pay
him
two
dollars
per
week
industry
and
forethought
are
peculiar
traits
of
the
carib
women
consequently
they
easily
surround
themselves
with
necessaries
and
comforts
the
data
bearing
on
the
proportion
of
the
sexes
in
the
aggregate
population
although
too
imperfect
to
be
worth
presenting
yet
go
to
show
that
as
in
mexico
there
is
a
considerable
preponderance
of
females
the
disproportion
in
births
is
not
so
great
as
in
deaths
for
while
the
number
of
males
and
females
born
is
nearly
equal
more
of
the
former
than
the
latter
die
annually
there
are
more
old
women
than
old
men
ascribable
no
doubt
to
the
greater
sobriety
of
the
women
drunkenness
being
a
vice
which
under
the
tropics
is
rapid
in
its
consequences
in
nicaragua
the
women
number
two
to
one
of
the
male
population

of
cuscatlan

excess
of

over

peru

though
neighboring
countries
and
both
in
the
strip
of
western
coast
between
the
andes
and
the

present
considerable
difference
of
condition
chili
is
rapidly
rising
in
political
importance
by
means
of
the
internal
energy
of
the
people
and
the
development
of
natural
resources
by
native
and
foreign
enterprise
and
capital
it
has
been
asserted
by
resident
that
female
virtue
was
at
so
low
an
ebb
in
chili
within
a
few
years
that
in
most
families
even
of
good
standing
there
were
one
or
more
children
who
were
called
children
of
the
house
and
whose
parentage
was
distributed
generally
among
the
ladies
of
the
family
nay
we
have
heard
that
the
rites
of
hospitality
sometimes
included
civilities
in
respect
to
the
females
which
are
usually
considered
as
peculiar
to
certain
oriental
nations
a
rapid
change
for
the
better
is
however
taking
place
in
these
usages
and
even
the
of
valparaiso
is
described
by
wilkes
as
being
greatly
improved
from
the
period
of
his
first
visit
when
few
sailors
left
it
without
having
lost
both
their
money
and
health
among
its
women
peru
has
made
but
little
advance
in
its
recent
political
changes
the
government
is
in
a
state
of
continual
anarchy
a
new
mine
of
wealth
has
been
discovered
in
the
guano
deposits
of
the
chincha
islands
which
has
attracted
great
numbers
of
foreign
vessels
to
its
shores
but
the
wealth
acquired
from
this
source
has
done
little
for
the
people
lima
the
capital
has
long
been
remarkable
for
the
levity
and
dissipation
of
its
inhabitants
the
very
dress
of
the
ladies
which
may
have
been
originally
intended
to
insure
seclusion
and
privacy
has
become
an
emblem
of
intrigue
it
consists
of
a
peculiar
hood
and
petticoat
covering
the
wearer
entirely
who
when
thus
in
domino
is
styled
and
is
by
common
usage
held
to
be
secure
from
all
impertinent
interference
or
insult
the
same
term
is
applied
to
a
shawl
worn
over
the
head
so
as
to
cover
the
mouth
and
forehead
under
this
concealment
the
wearer
is
known
only
to
the
most
intimate
friends
and
ladies
thus
attired
frequent
the
theatres
it
is
favorable
to
intrigue
and
so
perfect
is
the
security
that
any
place
of
amusement
may
be
visited
with
impunity
and
even
if
suspected
by
the
husband
or
relative
she
is
protected
from
discovery
by
the
respect
attached
to
the
custom
tschudi
draws
a
very
cheerless
picture
of
the
state
and
prospects
of
peru
its
moral
degradation
is
significantly
typified
in
the
decline
of
its
population
which
has
been
continually
diminishing
since
the
establishment
of
its
independence
that
noble
land
which
contained
an
enormous
population
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
numbered
in
less
than
inhabitants
not
so
many
as
were
formerly
found
in
the
department
of
cusco
alone
the
deaths
in
lima
vary
annually
from
to
out
of
a
population
of
in
the
ten
months
from
january
to
october
they
were
the
births
in
that
period
being
of
which
were
illegitimate
not
less
remarkable
than
the
number
of
illegitimate
children
is
that
of
the
infants
exposed
and
found
dead
these
afford
the
most
striking
proofs
of
the
immorality
which
prevails
in
lima
especially
among
the
colored
people
to
them
belong
nearly
two
thirds
of
the
illegitimate
births
and
fully
four
fifths
of
the
children
cast
out
to
die
there
is
reason
to
suspect
though
it
can
not
be
positively
proved
that
no
small
portion
of
the
latter
suffer
a
violent
death
by
the
hands
of
their
mothers
when
a
dead
child
is
picked
up
before
the
church
of
san
lazaro
or
in
the
street
it
is
carried
without
a
word
of
inquiry
to
the
pantheon
frequently
it
is
not
even
thought
worth
while
to
bury
it
i
have
seen
the
vultures
dragging
about
the
sweltering
carcasses
of
infants
and
devouring
them
in
populous
streets
on
comparing
the
lists
of
births
and
deaths
from
to
i
satisfied
myself
that
the
annual
excess
of
the
latter
over
the
former
averages
the
women
of
lima
are
far
superior
to
the
men
both
corporeally
and
intellectually
though
their
conduct
in
many
respects
is
any
thing
but
exemplary
they
cling
with
invincible
tenacity
to
the
use
of
their
national
walking
garb
the
y
in
which
they
take
their
pleasure
in
the
streets
making
keen
play
with
the
one
eye
they
leave
uncovered
and
quite
secure
in
that
disguise
from
detection
even
by
the
most
jealous
scrutiny
the
veil
is
inviolable
any
man
who
should
attempt
to
pluck
off
a
woman
would
be
very
severely
handled
by
the
populace
the
history
of
their
lives
comprises
two
phases
in
the
full
bloom
of
their
fascinating
beauty
their
time
is
divided
between
doing
naught
and
naughty
doings
when
their
charms
are
on
the
wane
they
take
to
devotion
and
scandal
a
young
lady
of
lima
rises
late
dresses
her
hair
with
orange
or
jasmine
flowers
and
waits
for
breakfast
after
which
she
receives
or
pays
visits
during
the
heat
of
the
day
she
swings
in
a
hammock
or
reclines
on
a
sofa
smoking
a
cigar
after
dinner
she
again
pays
visits
and
finishes
the
evening
either
in
the
theatre
or
the
plaza
or
on
the
bridge
few
ladies
occupy
themselves
with
needlework
or
netting
though
some
of
them
possess
great
skill
in
those
arts
the
pride
which
the
fair
limeñas
take
in
their
dainty
little
feet
knows
no
bounds
walking
sitting
or
standing
swinging
in
the
hammock
or
lying
on
the
sofa
they
are
ever
watchful
to
let
their
tiny
feet
be
seen
praise
of
their
virtue
their
intelligence
or
their
beauty
sounds
not
half
so
sweetly
in
their
ears
as
encomiums
bestowed
on
their
pretty
feet
they
take
the
most
scrupulous
care
of
them
and
avoid
every
thing
that
might
favor
their
enlargement
a
large
foot
an
english
foot
as
they
say
is
an
abomination
to
them
i
once
heard

lady
deservedly
extolled
by
some
fair
dames
of
lima
but
they
wound
up
their
eulogy
with
these
words
que
pie
valgame
dio
sparece
una
lancha
but
what
a
foot
good
heavens
it
is
like
a
great
boat
and
yet
the
foot
in
question
would
by
no
means
have
been
thought
large
in
europe
the
limeñas
possess
in
an
extraordinary
degree
talents
which
unhappily
are
seldom
cultivated
as
they
should
be
they
have
great
penetration
sound
judgment
and
very
correct
views
respecting
the
most
diversified
affairs
of
life
like
the
women
of
seville
they
are
remarkable
for
their
quick
and
pointed
repartees
and
a
limeña
is
sure
never
to
come
off
second
best
in
a
war
of
words
they
possess
a
rare
firmness
of
character
and
a
courage
not
generally
given
to
their
sex
in
these
respects
they
are
far
superior
to
the
dastardly
vacillating
men
and
they
have
played
as
important
a
part
as
the
latter
often
one
much
more
so
in
all
the
political
troubles
of
their
country
ambitious
and
aspiring
accustomed
to
conduct
with
ease
the
maziest
intrigues
with
a
presence
of
mind
that
never
fails
them
at
critical
moments
passionate
and
bold
they
mingle
in
the
great
game
of
politics
with
momentous
effect
and
usually
turn
it
to
their
own
advantage
seldom
to
that
of
the
state
add
to
this
picture
that
though
delicate
modest
women
are
rare
actual
adultery
is
not
often
committed
by
the
sex
but
that
concubinage
is
more
common
or
rather
perhaps
more
public
than
in
europe
the
father
being
usually
very
fond
and
careful
of
his
natural
children
and
a
fair
view
is
obtained
of
female
character
in
lima
the
white
creoles
are
noted
for
sensuality
and
some
of
the
dances
in
which
they
indulge
are
of
indescribable
obscenity
the
influx
of
foreign
ships
and
seamen
into
callao
the
port
of
lima
has
brought
in
its
train
the
usual
accompaniments
drunkenness
and
debauchery
a
few
years
ago
it
was
almost
in
decay
and
ruin
now
it
swarms
with
and
prostitutes
and
is
probably
as
profligate
a
place
as
any
in
the
western
hemisphere
passing
to
the
atlantic
coast
of
south
america
we
find
robertson
the
author
of
letters
from
paraguay
writing
of
female
spanish
society
at
the
city
of
santa
fe
i
was
particularly
struck
by
the
extremely
free
nature
to
use
the
very
gentlest
expression
of
the
conversation
which
was
adopted
with
the
ladies
young
and
old
it
was
such
as
to
make
me
with
my
unsophisticated
english
feelings
blush
at
every
turn
although
such
modesty
whenever
it
was
observed
caused
a
hearty
laugh
the
same
author
speaking
of
female
society
in
rio
says
there
is
no
society
at
rio
for
i
can
not
call
that
society
from
which
females
are
excluded
generally
speaking
the
husband
of
a
brazilian
wife
is
not
so
much
her
companion
as
her
keeper
his
house
is
the
abode
of
jealousy
and
distrust
for
he
can
not
always
stretch
his
confidence
to
the
point
of
imagining
fidelity
in
the
wife
of
his
bosom
any
more
than
he
can
rely
on
the
virtuous
forbearance
of
the
friend
of
his
heart
his
daughters
are
brought
up
in
moorish
seclusion
and
his
wife
is
delivered
over
to
the
keeping
of
a
train
of
sombre
slaves
and
domestics
it
may
be
thought
that
some
of
these
remarks
are
applicable
to
periods
of
time
and
conditions
of
society
now
happily
passed
away
but
the
poison
of
moral
depravity
when
once
taken
up
is
not
to
be
speedily
eliminated
from
the
system
of
nations
more
than
of
individuals
a
very
recent
traveler
stewart
testifies
to
the
demoralization
of
female
society
in
all
classes
with
such
uniform
representations
of
the
general
immorality
and
of
the
low
estimate
in
which
female
virtue
is
held
in
south
america
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
there
are
any
special
details
on
the
subject
of
our
investigation
prostitution
is
in
some
degree
attendant
upon
a
state
of
public
feeling
in
which
the
purity
of
wives
and
daughters
is
held
in
respect
not
viewed
with
jealousy
but
with
reverence
in
south
america
even
in
the
present
time
females
mix
but
little
in
society
their
education
is
very
limited
terminates
early
and
they
are
always
under
some
kind
of
guardianship
or
chaperonage
in
public
this
does
not
elevate
the
female
character
freedom
and
are
the
best
protectives
to
virtue
and
honor
and
the
seclusion
of
women
from
general
society
only
serves
to
invest
them
with
the
attraction
of
mystery
to
the
libertine
while
it
takes
away
from
themselves
the
experience
and
in
which
they
find
a
safeguard
in
south
america
generally
the
character
of
the
priesthood
is
unfortunately
open
to
reprobation
in
brazil
the
priests
are
reputed
to
be
free
livers
nearly
all
of
them
have
families
and
when
seen
leaving
the
dwellings
of
their
wives
or
of
the
females
they
visit
they
speak
of
them
as
their
nieces
or
sisters
some
unequivocally
admit
the
relationship
existing
and
acknowledge
their
children
the
value
of
the
priestly
character
in
estimating
the
standard
of
morality
among
a
population
is
unquestionably
great
an
enlightened
native
said
to
ewbank
the
priesthood
of
this
country
is
superlatively
corrupt
it
is
impossible
for
men
to
be
worse
or
to
imagine
them
worse
in
the
churches
they
appear
respectable
and
devout
but
their
secret
crimes
have
made
this
city
a
sodom
there
are
of
course
honorable
exceptions
another
a
man
of
unquestionable
authority
said
they
are
assuredly
the
most
licentious
and
profligate
part
of
the
community
the
exceptions
are
rare
celibacy
being
one
of
their
dogmas
you
will
find
nearly
the
whole
with
families
at
rio
janeiro
there
is
a
foundling
hospital
established
in
which
is
a
noble
institution
the
boys
are
provided
for
at
botofoga
and
are
in
due
time
apprenticed
to
trades
the
girls
reside
in
the
city
establishment
and
are
taught
to
read
write
sew
etc
at
each
anniversary
bachelors
in
want
of
wives
attend
at
the
festival
and
if
they
see
girls
to
their
liking
make
themselves
known
if
a
girl
accepts
such
a
lover
he
makes
his
application
to
the
managers
who
inquire
into
his
character
and
if
satisfactory
the
marriage
takes
place
and
a
small
dowry
is
given
from
the
funds
of
the
society
in
the
management
of
the
institution
or
the
reception
of
infants
there
is
nothing
peculiarly
worthy
notice
but
if
those
who
are
averse
to
such
institutions
contrast
the
blessed
results
of
saving
these
helpless
infants
from
misery
and
the
horror
of
beholding
their
dead
bodies
cast
on
dunghills
to
be
devoured
as
carrion
by
obscene
animals
and
birds
of
prey
as
has
been
mentioned
in
the
notice
of
lima
they
would
on
such
grounds
even
if
there
were
no
better
to
be
urged
suspend
a
hasty
judgment

north
american

decrease
of
the
indian
treatment
of
stealing
domestic
life
among
the
crow
pine
leaf
female
conjugal
female
intrigue
and
decency
of
outward
effects
of
contact
with
white
traders
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
the
vast
continent
of
america
have
been
variously
described
by
different
writers
one
man
lauding
them
as
models
of
chivalry
and
virtue
another
decrying
them
as
the
personification
of
meanness
and
vice
hence
it
is
only
at
a
recent
period
comparatively
speaking
that
any
reliable
information
has
been
obtainable
on
the
subject
in
the
limited
space
that
can
be
given
to
a
consideration
of
the
indian
and
his
social
habits
we
shall
endeavor
to
reject
both
romance
and
vituperation
we
do
not
believe
him
so
stoically
virtuous
as
the
former
class
of
writers
depict
nor
do
we
think
that
all
of
the
race
are
so
deeply
sunk
in
depravity
as
the
latter
represent
in
addition
to
the
authorities
quoted
in
the
progress
of
the
chapter
we
are
under
obligations
to
horace
john
article
on
prostitution
incorporated
by
mayhew
in
his
tracts
on
london
labor
and
the
london
poor
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
of
jamestown
and
plymouth
it
was
estimated
that
there
were
about
two
millions
of
indians
scattered
over
this
continent
they
were
then
a
brave
and
hardy
people
who
lived
on
the
produce
of
the
chase
varying
their
locations
as
the
facilities
for
hunting
required
when
the
last
census
of
the
united
states
was
taken
their
numbers
were
about
four
hundred
thousand
exclusive
of
fifteen
thousand
in
canada
and
the
british
possessions
this
decrease
has
been
ascribed
to
the
occupation
of
their
by
white
men
and
the
consequent
extermination
of
the
game
upon
which
they
depended
for
subsistence
the
free
use
of
intoxicating
liquors
and
the
introduction
of
and
other
fatal
diseases
these
causes
will
in
all
probability
result
in
the
entire
extinction
of
the
race
in
the
small
number
mentioned
are
many
children
of
white
fathers
and
indian
mothers
it
might
naturally
be
supposed
that
in
the
several
tribes
composing
this
people
there
would
exist
great
diversity
of
manners
but
these
are
found
only
in
minor
particulars
the
social
institutions
of
the
north
american
indians
are
so
generally
uniform
as
to
render
it
possible
to
sketch
the
whole
at
one
view
their
occupations
are
still
confined
to
the
chase
and
the
to
perform
a
round
of
daily
labor
even
though
it
insured
the
most
ample
provision
for
his
wants
would
be
contrary
alike
to
the
inclination
and
the
supposed
dignity
of
the
red
man
who
will
scarcely
deign
to
follow
any
pursuit
which
does
not
combine
enterprise
and
excitement
woman
therefore
becomes
the
drudge
and
slave
upon
her
devolves
the
duty
of
cultivating
the
ground
whenever
any
attempt
is
made
to
assist
the
spontaneous
efforts
of
nature
she
it
is
who
must
bear
the
load
of
game
which
her
husband
has
killed
must
carry
wood
and
water
build
huts
and
make
canoes
in
fishing
and
in
reaping
their
scanty
harvest
the
man
will
at
times
condescend
to
assist
her
but
otherwise
all
the
labor
falls
to
her
share
in
those
tribes
visited
by
traders
her
duties
are
still
heavier
she
must
join
in
the
hunt
and
afterward
dress
and
prepare
the
skins
and
furs
which
are
to
be
bartered
for
whisky
and
other
luxuries
to
this
degraded
condition
the
women
seem
perfectly
reconciled
and
expertness
at
the
assigned
employment
is
a
source
of
pride
to
them
the
treatment
of
the
female
sex
is
generally
admitted
to
be
a
standard
by
which
man
moral
qualities
can
be
estimated
it
may
be
doubted
if
this
rule
would
apply
to
the
indian
tribes
for
those
who
treat
their
females
most
mildly
are
by
no
means
the
most
virtuous
nor
is
their
deference
attended
by
any
increase
of
attachment
the
general
opinion
of
a
value
being
the
consideration
of
her
capacity
to
be
useful
where
they
aid
in
procuring
food
or
luxuries
for
the
tribe
they
are
held
in
more
esteem
while
in
places
where
the
chief
burden
of
providing
rests
upon
the
men
they
are
treated
with
severity
even
when
oppressed
with
these
laborious
occupations
the
women
have
as
much
native
vanity
in
respect
to
decoration
as
the
sex
in
any
part
of
the
world
and
an
accurate
observer
remarks
that
judging
from
the
time
a
squaw
often
occupies
in
arranging
her
hair
or
disposing
her
scanty
dress
or
painting
her
round
cheeks
with
glaring
circles
of
vermilion
it
is
evident
that
personal
ornament
occupies
as
much
of
her
thoughts
as
among
fashionable
women
in
civilized
society
courtship
and
marriage
are
differently
arranged
among
various
tribes
the
predominant
custom
is
for
a
man
to
procure
a
wife
by
purchase
from
her
father
thus
acquiring
a
property
over
which
he
has
absolute
control
and
which
he
can
barter
away
or
dispose
of
in
any
manner
he
pleases
the
example
of
powhatan
who
was
chief
ruler
over
thirty
tribes
in
virginia
at
the
time
of
the
english
colonization
is
a
case
in
point
it
is
said
that
he
always
had
a
multitude
of
wives
about
him
and
when
he
wearied
of
any
would
distribute
them
as
presents
among
his
principal
warriors
in
most
cases
the
woman
is
not
consulted
at
all
the
whole
transaction
being
a
mercantile
one
in
others
an
infant
female
is
betrothed
by
her
father
for
a
consideration
to
some
man
who
requires
a
wife
either
for
himself
or
for
his
son
the
girl
remains
with
her
parents
until
the
age
of
puberty
when
the
contract
is
completed
at
which
time
the
father
often
makes
a
present
to
the
husband
equal
in
value
to
the
price
originally
paid
for
his
daughter
another
mode
of
obtaining
a
wife
is
to
steal
a
girl
from
some
neighboring
tribe
captain
clarke
who
crossed
the
rocky
mountains
in
the
years
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
an
expedition
ordered
by
the
executive
of
the
united
states
records
instances
of
this
kind
he
says
one
of
the
ahnahaways
had
stolen
a
minnetaree
girl
the
whole
nation
immediately
espoused
the
quarrel
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
warriors
were
marching
down
to
avenge
the
insult
the
chief
took
possession
of
the
girl
and
sent
her
by
messengers
to
the
hands
of
her
countrymen
in
time
to
avert
the
threatened
calamity
a
young
minnetaree
had
carried
off
the
daughter
of
a
chief
of
the
mandans
the
father
went
to
the
village
and
found
his
daughter
whom
he
brought
home
and
at
the
same
time
took
possession
of
a
horse
belonging
to
the
offender
this
reprisal
satisfied
his
vengeance
the
stealing
of
young
women
is
one
of
the
most
common
offenses
a
more
peaceable
kind
of
preliminary
to
matrimony
is
for
a
man
desiring
a
wife
to
offer
a
small
present
to
the
woman
if
she
accepts
it
and
offers
him
one
in
return
the
match
is
complete
or
he
may
tell
her
his
wishes
without
any
introductory
gift
and
if
agreeable
she
will
reply
accordingly
others
will
not
venture
to
express
their
thoughts
but
will
sit
quietly
by
a
girl
side
and
if
she
does
not
remove
from
her
seat
her
assent
is
understood
to
be
given
still
another
custom
is
for
the
lover
to
enter
the
woman
tent
at
night
bearing
a
lighted
torch
if
she
allows
it
to
burn
it
is
a
sign
that
his
attentions
are
not
desired
but
if
she
extinguishes
it
she
thus
intimates
that
he
is
accepted
it
will
not
require
much
knowledge
of
human
nature
to
imagine
the
consequences
of
these
nocturnal
visits
a
recently
published
work
life
and
adventures
of
james
beckwourth
new
york
professes
to
give
an
accurate
account
of
the
domestic
life
of
the
crow
indians
among
whom
he
lived
for
some
years
and
became
a
chief
of
the
tribe
who
believed
that
he
was
one
of
themselves
and
had
been
stolen
from
them
in
infancy
it
may
be
necessary
to
say
that
we
only
quote
him
on
points
where
corroborative
evidence
can
be
obtained
from
other
sources
his
character
for
veracity
is
questionable
and
among
the
miners
of
california
where
he
is
known
any
extravagant
tale
is
proverbially
called
one
of
jem
beckwourth
lies
his
first
experience
of
matrimony
showing
that
the
woman
consent
was
not
asked
but
that
the
arrangements
were
made
by
the
parents
is
thus
stated
while
conversing
with
my
father
he
suddenly
demanded
if
i
wanted
a
wife
i
assented
well
said
he
shall
have
a
pretty
wife
and
a
good
one
away
he
strode
to
the
lodge
of
one
of
the
greatest
braves
and
asked
one
of
his
daughters
of
him
to
bestow
upon
his
son
the
consent
of
the
parent
was
readily
given
he
had
three
very
pretty
daughters
and
the
ensuing
day
they
were
brought
to
my
father
lodge
and
i
was
requested
to
take
my
choice
the
eldest
was
named
water
and
i
chose
her
the
acceptance
of
my
wife
was
the
completion
of
the
ceremony
and
i
was
a
married
man
as
sacredly
in
their
eyes
as
if
the
holy
christian
church
had
fastened
the
irrevocable
knot
upon
us
cases
are
also
recorded
by
indian
travelers
wherein
a
custom
more
assimilating
to
civilized
notions
is
adopted
a
young
man
will
court
a
girl
for
a
length
of
time
using
all
his
endeavors
to
cultivate
her
affections
and
the
woman
upon
her
part
will
entertain
an
equal
tenderness
for
him
again
turning
to
the
pages
of
beckwourth
we
find
an
instance
of
this
in
the
case
of
a
woman
who
attracted
his
attention
it
must
not
be
considered
that
he
was
a
victim
of
the
romantic
affliction
called
first
love
for
he
had
some
six
or
eight
wives
in
the
tribe
at
the
time
his
description
is
as
follows
in
connection
with
my
indian
experience
i
conceive
it
to
be
my
duty
to
devote
a
few
lines
to
one
of
the
bravest
women
that
ever
lived
namely
leaf
in
indian
she
possessed
great
intellectual
powers
her
features
were
pleasing
and
her
form
symmetrical
she
had
lost
a
twin
brother
in
an
attack
on
the
village
and
was
left
to
avenge
his
death
she
was
at
that
time
twelve
years
of
age
and
solemnly
vowed
that
she
would
never
marry
until
she
had
killed
a
hundred
of
the
enemy
with
her
own
hand
whenever
a
started
pine
leaf
was
the
first
to
volunteer
to
accompany
them
she
had
chosen
my
party
to
serve
in
i
began
to
feel
more
than
a
common
attachment
toward
her
one
day
while
riding
leisurely
along
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
provided
we
both
returned
safe
she
laughed
and
said
i
will
marry
you
we
return
but
when
the
pine
leaves
turn
yellow
i
reflected
that
it
would
soon
be
winter
and
regarded
her
promise
as
valid
a
few
days
afterward
it
occurred
to
me
that
pine
leaves
do
not
turn
yellow
and
i
saw
i
had
been
practiced
upon
when
i
again
spoke
to
her
on
the
subject
i
said
leaf
you
promised
to
marry
me
when
the
pine
leaves
turn
yellow
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
they
never
turn
yellow
am
i
to
understand
that
you
never
intend
to
marry
me
i
will
marry
you
she
said
with
a
coquettish
smile
when
you
shall
find
a
redheaded
indian
i
saw
i
advanced
nothing
by
importuning
her
and
i
let
the
matter
rest
it
would
occupy
too
much
space
to
recite
all
the
details
of
a
long
courtship
including
scenes
in
war
and
chase
at
the
camp
or
on
excursions
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
heroine
accomplished
her
vow
and
seemed
convinced
of
the
sincerity
of
her
lover
she
concluded
the
courtship
thus
she
then
approached
me
every
eye
being
intently
fixed
upon
her
at
me
she
said
know
that
your
heart
is
crying
for
the
follies
of
the
people
but
let
it
cry
no
more
i
am
yours
after
you
have
so
long
been
seeking
me
i
believe
you
love
me
our
lodge
shall
be
a
happy
one
and
when
you
depart
to
the
happy
i
will
be
already
there
to
welcome
you
this
day
i
become
your
wife
women
will
sometimes
voluntarily
ask
men
to
marry
them
promising
to
be
faithful
and
obedient
this
request
is
seldom
refused
as
the
marriage
tie
is
easily
dissolved
if
the
union
proves
unpleasant
tanner
who
was
taken
prisoner
by
a
and
lived
among
various
tribes
in
the
northwest
for
nearly
thirty
years
relates
a
case
in
point
the
woman
endeavors
to
secure
him
as
her
husband
commenced
with
an
invitation
to
smoke
with
her
he
acceded
but
either
his
blood
was
not
so
warm
as
that
coursing
through
indian
veins
or
from
some
other
cause
it
was
long
before
he
consented
to
the
proposed
companionship
which
a
red
man
would
have
accepted
on
the
spot
the
girl
resolutely
pursued
him
and
at
last
with
the
consent
of
her
father
took
possession
of
his
hut
while
he
was
absent
when
he
returned
he
could
not
put
the
young
woman
to
shame
by
sending
her
back
to
her
friends
and
so
they
became
man
and
wife
beckwourth
also
had
some
experience
of
this
custom
a
little
girl
who
had
often
asked
me
to
marry
her
came
to
me
one
day
and
with
every
importunity
insisted
on
my
accepting
her
as
my
wife
i
said
you
are
older
i
will
talk
to
you
about
it
but
she
would
not
be
put
off
are
a
great
brave
she
said
if
i
am
your
wife
you
will
paint
my
face
when
you
return
from
the
war
and
i
shall
be
proud
the
little
innocent
used
such
powerful
appeals
that
i
told
her
she
might
be
my
wife
he
lived
with
her
until
he
left
the
indians
and
her
son
is
now
chief
of
the
tribe
the
women
taken
prisoners
in
war
are
frequently
married
into
the
tribe
that
captured
them
but
never
to
the
captors
who
stand
in
the
relation
of
brothers
to
them
and
by
whom
they
are
protected
from
insult
a
warrior
who
has
taken
a
female
prisoner
usually
makes
an
exchange
with
another
who
has
had
the
same
fortune
each
being
thus
accommodated
without
infringing
upon
custom
if
a
man
has
seized
more
than
he
can
dispose
of
in
that
way
he
generally
gives
them
to
any
man
who
will
accept
them
in
the
same
manner
a
woman
whose
husband
has
been
killed
in
battle
will
ask
a
warrior
for
a
male
prisoner
who
accordingly
becomes
the
successor
of
one
whom
he
has
probably
slain
in
these
cases
the
man
is
adopted
as
one
of
the
tribe
is
kindly
treated
and
entitled
to
his
share
of
all
their
advantages
the
marriages
are
without
ceremony
of
any
kind
the
parties
agree
to
live
with
each
other
as
long
as
they
can
do
so
with
mutual
satisfaction
and
the
man
conducts
his
bride
to
his
hut
at
once
or
resides
with
her
at
her
father
cabin
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
ordinary
requirements
of
a
married
life
are
systematically
unheeded
for
as
a
general
rule
the
squaws
are
faithful
to
their
husbands
who
upon
their
part
rigidly
exact
this
fidelity
even
if
they
do
not
practice
it
themselves
the
general
description
of
the
position
of
indian
women
already
given
applies
equally
to
their
state
after
marriage
they
continue
sometimes
the
abject
slaves
otherwise
the
patient
servants
of
their
husbands
while
he
eats
the
food
she
has
cooked
and
probably
caught
herself
she
must
wait
in
submissive
silence
at
all
times
she
approaches
him
with
the
deference
due
to
a
superior
being
an
indian
will
never
evince
the
slightest
symptom
of
tenderness
toward
his
wife
this
would
be
opposed
to
his
idea
of
manly
dignity
but
the
eagerness
with
which
he
will
revenge
her
wrongs
proves
that
his
apparent
apathy
springs
only
from
pride
or
a
fancied
sense
of
decorum
when
catlin
proposed
to
paint
the
portrait
of
the
wife
of
a
sioux
chief
his
offer
was
ridiculed
and
it
was
considered
marvelous
that
he
should
honor
a
woman
in
the
same
manner
he
had
honored
the
warriors
as
the
former
had
never
taken
any
scalps
never
done
any
thing
but
make
fires
dress
skins
and
other
servile
employments
to
infer
from
these
facts
that
there
is
no
conjugal
affection
among
this
people
would
be
erroneous
notwithstanding
their
assumed
indifference
instances
are
not
rare
of
strong
mutual
attachment
to
an
indian
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
affection
in
his
indolently
walking
through
the
forest
while
his
wife
follows
him
bearing
the
heavy
wigwam
poles
his
ideas
never
having
been
led
to
consider
this
as
other
than
her
natural
duty
many
pictures
of
domestic
happiness
are
exhibited
among
the
indians
and
the
blackfeet
sanee
and
blood
tribes
strongly
desire
that
their
wives
may
live
long
and
look
young
heckewelder
relates
a
singular
instance
of
indulgence
in
there
was
a
scarcity
of
food
among
many
tribes
and
during
the
prevalence
of
this
famine
a
sick
woman
wished
for
a
mess
of
indian
corn
her
husband
rode
about
a
hundred
miles
to
obtain
it
gave
his
horse
in
exchange
for
a
hatful
and
returned
home
on
foot
with
the
coveted
dainty
these
lords
of
creation
attempt
to
enforce
their
marital
rights
with
much
severity
and
if
their
suspicions
are
excited
against
their
wives
become
very
indignant
and
punish
them
by
beating
biting
off
the
nose
dismissing
them
in
disgrace
or
even
killing
them
the
wife
of
a
mandan
indian
ran
away
from
him
in
consequence
of
a
quarrel
by
so
doing
she
forfeited
her
life
which
custom
would
have
justified
the
husband
in
taking
and
he
would
have
murdered
her
but
for
the
interposition
of
the
travelers
who
gave
him
a
few
presents
and
persuaded
him
to
take
his
wife
home
they
went
off
together
but
by
no
means
in
a
state
of
much
apparent
love
this
trouble
arose
from
jealousy
in
another
case
a
minnetaree
had
much
abused
his
wife
for
the
same
reason
and
she
sought
refuge
in
the
camp
her
husband
followed
and
demanded
her
and
she
returned
with
him
as
we
had
no
authority
to
separate
those
whom
even
indian
rites
had
united
since
an
indian
considers
his
wife
as
so
much
property
equally
valuable
as
his
horse
and
for
the
same
reason
for
the
labor
she
can
perform
we
can
easily
understand
that
polygamy
is
universally
allowed
though
it
is
not
generally
practiced
being
confined
to
great
chiefs
and
as
the
rank
and
file
are
often
too
poor
to
buy
a
second
wife
many
follow
the
custom
for
the
mere
purpose
of
amassing
wealth
but
others
of
the
stoic
warriors
delight
in
the
harem
from
the
same
sensual
motives
as
a
turk
or
hindu
among
the
communities
that
catlin
had
an
opportunity
of
visiting
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
to
find
from
six
to
fourteen
wives
in
the
same
lodge
he
mentions
an
instance
in
which
a
young
chief
of
the
mandans
took
four
wives
in
one
day
paying
a
horse
or
two
for
each
these
brides
were
from
twelve
to
fourteen
years
of
age
an
indian
marriage
at
this
age
is
far
from
uncommon
and
indeed
it
appears
from
good
testimony
that
celibacy
beyond
the
age
of
puberty
is
very
rare
some
of
the
females
are
mothers
before
they
are
twelve
years
old
it
is
not
universal
for
the
wives
to
live
all
in
one
hut
some
tribes
requiring
separate
lodgings
for
each
this
custom
is
in
force
among
the
crows
and
beckwourth
relates
that
on
returning
from
one
of
his
excursions
he
made
a
round
of
visits
to
his
wives
some
of
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
months
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
man
to
marry
his
wife
sister
and
indeed
the
whole
family
of
girls
on
the
supposition
that
his
household
will
thus
be
rendered
more
harmonious
for
the
same
reason
a
cherokee
will
marry
a
mother
and
her
daughter
at
one
time
though
he
will
not
upon
any
account
take
a
wife
from
his
own
kindred
among
the
oregon
tribes
it
is
strictly
required
that
each
wife
should
be
purchased
from
a
different
family
so
well
established
among
indians
is
the
custom
of
polygamy
that
civilization
meets
the
greatest
difficulty
in
opposing
it
and
if
ever
abolished
it
will
overthrow
their
whole
social
system
and
in
changing
their
national
character
tend
to
their
speedy
extinction
sir
george
simpson
relates
an
amusing
anecdote
of
an
indian
who
came
into
the
settled
districts
of
british
north
america
learned
to
read
and
write
and
adopted
the
principle
of
monogamy
returning
to
his
tribe
he
endeavored
to
persuade
them
to
the
same
course
long
and
earnest
were
the
debates
on
the
question
and
the
was
instead
of
converting
them
they
reconverted
him
he
took
a
great
number
of
wives
foreswore
books
and
never
again
appeared
in
the
character
of
a
social
reformer
another
chief
offered
to
renounce
polygamy
he
having
five
wives
and
a
large
fortune
in
horses
and
cattle
falling
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
in
the
service
of
the
hudson
bay
company
he
dismissed
his
harem
and
presented
himself
with
great
parade
and
confidence
to
make
his
matrimonial
proposal
to
the
lady
family
to
his
extreme
disgust
and
mortification
they
rejected
the
honor
of
his
distinguished
alliance
he
revenged
himself
by
refilling
his
hut
with
women
as
quickly
as
possible
if
the
obligation
of
marriage
is
easily
contracted
divorce
is
effected
with
as
little
trouble
it
is
not
often
that
a
separation
takes
place
for
it
is
held
dishonorable
to
forsake
a
wife
for
a
trifling
cause
particularly
if
she
has
borne
children
when
it
does
occur
the
offspring
are
usually
permitted
to
decide
which
of
the
parents
they
will
accompany
although
usage
gives
the
mother
the
right
to
take
charge
of
them
in
some
instances
the
form
of
divorce
is
simply
for
the
husband
to
bid
his
wife
go
in
others
he
will
not
take
the
trouble
to
give
her
notice
of
his
discontent
but
will
quietly
put
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
move
off
himself
there
are
a
few
instances
of
this
being
done
for
very
slight
reasons
but
in
addition
to
the
restraint
of
custom
just
mentioned
the
actual
value
of
the
wife
is
a
subject
of
consideration
where
a
separation
does
take
place
the
man
will
often
endeavor
to
renew
the
connection
a
missionary
mentions
a
woman
who
contracted
a
new
marriage
after
her
husband
left
her
he
returned
and
claimed
her
the
dispute
was
referred
to
a
chief
and
he
either
wanting
a
precedent
or
distrusting
his
judicial
capacity
could
think
of
no
better
expedient
than
placing
the
woman
at
an
equal
distance
from
each
claimant
and
then
ordering
the
men
to
run
promising
that
the
one
who
first
reached
her
should
retain
possession
of
the
prize
in
some
tribes
divorce
renders
it
impossible
for
the
woman
to
marry
again
but
in
others
she
can
make
a
new
alliance
as
soon
as
free
from
the
old
one
it
is
difficult
to
form
any
opinion
as
to
the
morality
of
females
among
a
people
where
marriages
are
contracted
and
dissolved
so
easily
we
may
safely
say
that
they
have
very
little
idea
of
chastity
as
a
positive
virtue
notwithstanding
their
general
although
not
invariable
fidelity
when
married
which
may
probably
be
induced
more
by
fear
of
consequences
than
sense
of
duty
of
prostitution
for
a
price
as
known
in
civilized
communities
we
find
no
trace
in
the
indian
nations
while
in
a
normal
condition
but
if
we
assume
webster
definition
the
act
of
offering
the
body
to
an
indiscriminate
intercourse
with
men
it
can
scarcely
be
claimed
that
they
are
free
the
predominant
motive
seems
to
be
an
inordinate
sexual
appetite
which
must
be
gratified
if
not
in
legitimate
marriage
then
by
illicit
intercourse
we
are
told
that
in
most
large
assemblies
of
indians
there
are
to
be
seen
voluptuous
looking
females
whose
passions
urge
them
to
this
and
carver
in
his
travels
in
north
america
says
that
among
the
manedowessis
it
was
a
custom
when
a
young
woman
could
not
get
a
husband
for
her
to
assemble
all
the
leading
warriors
of
the
tribe
at
a
feast
and
when
their
hunger
was
appeased
to
retire
behind
a
screen
and
submit
to
the
embraces
of
each
in
succession
this
gained
her
great
applause
and
always
insured
her
a
husband
though
the
custom
is
now
almost
obsolete
the
principle
still
exists
and
prostitution
is
regarded
by
many
as
the
shortest
road
to
marriage
the
birth
of
a
bastard
child
entails
little
shame
upon
a
girl
and
that
such
children
are
not
more
frequent
is
due
less
to
their
chastity
than
to
the
means
they
employ
to
procure
abortion
one
of
the
reasons
advanced
for
their
early
marriages
is
that
the
impetuosity
of
the
girls
would
render
it
difficult
to
obtain
a
virtuous
wife
if
the
union
was
delayed
the
confessions
upon
starting
for
war
or
what
is
called
the
secret
would
also
favor
the
opinion
that
abstract
virtue
is
at
a
low
ebb
at
these
times
every
warrior
is
required
to
relate
to
his
companions
each
act
of
illicit
intercourse
he
has
committed
since
the
last
excursion
naming
his
partner
and
enumerating
the
facts
attending
the
frailty
this
obligation
is
enforced
by
the
most
rigid
oaths
known
to
indian
customs
this
immorality
is
not
confined
to
the
single
women
for
the
squaws
are
at
times
as
ready
to
take
part
in
an
intrigue
as
any
in
civilized
nations
beckwourth
whose
experience
of
indian
manners
seems
to
have
embraced
every
conceivable
phase
of
life
relates
his
adventures
in
this
way
a
brave
named
rain
was
elected
chief
of
the
village
he
possessed
a
most
beautiful
squaw
who
was
the
admiration
of
the
young
men
and
all
were
plotting
to
win
her
from
her
lord
i
determined
to
steal
her
be
the
consequences
what
they
might
having
enticed
the
husband
to
a
he
says
i
went
to
big
rain
lodge
dressed
and
painted
in
the
extreme
of
fashion
and
saw
the
lady
reclining
upon
her
couch
she
started
up
saying
is
here
it
is
i
do
you
want
here
have
come
to
see
you
because
i
love
you
you
know
that
i
am
the
chief
wife
i
know
it
but
he
does
not
love
you
as
i
do
i
can
paint
your
face
and
bring
you
fine
horses
but
as
long
as
you
are
the
wife
of
big
rain
he
will
never
paint
your
face
with
you
by
my
side
i
could
bring
home
many
scalps
then
we
could
often
dance
and
our
hearts
would
be
merry
now
she
pleaded
if
my
husband
should
return
i
fear
he
would
kill
you
go
for
your
own
sake
and
for
mine
i
will
not
go
till
you
give
me
a
pledge
that
you
will
be
mine
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
slipped
a
ring
from
her
finger
and
placed
it
on
mine
all
i
had
to
do
now
was
to
watch
for
a
favorable
chance
to
take
her
away
the
appointed
time
had
arrived
and
on
going
to
the
place
of
assignation
i
found
the
lady
true
to
her
word
in
fact
she
was
there
first
we
joined
the
party
and
were
absent
about
a
week
we
succeeded
in
capturing
stealing
one
hundred
and
seventeen
horses
and
arrived
safe
with
them
in
the
camp
meanwhile
big
rain
discovered
the
loss
of
his
wife
when
we
rode
in
he
took
no
part
in
the
rejoicing
but
ordered
his
wife
and
me
to
be
surrounded
and
with
half
a
dozen
of
his
sisters
all
armed
with
scourges
administered
a
most
unmerciful
whipping
i
received
it
with
indian
fortitude
if
i
had
resisted
they
would
have
been
justified
in
killing
me
also
if
they
had
drawn
one
drop
of
blood
i
should
have
been
justified
in
taking
their
lives
without
wishing
to
delay
the
progress
of
the
narrative
we
can
not
resist
the
impulse
to
express
admiration
of
the
indian
punishment
for
a
seducer
of
married
women
could
the
same
unromantic
penalty
be
duly
and
zealously
inflicted
for
similar
transgressions
in
places
of
more
pretensions
some
of
the
scandals
of
civilized
life
would
be
curtailed
to
resume
i
sent
word
to
the
wife
of
big
rain
that
i
should
go
out
again
the
next
night
and
should
expect
her
company
she
returned
a
favorable
answer
and
was
faithful
to
her
promise
on
my
return
i
received
another
such
flogging
as
the
first
two
nights
afterward
i
started
on
a
third
expedition
my
new
wife
accompanying
me
and
received
a
third
sound
thrashing
from
her
husband
finally
he
grew
furious
but
my
soldiers
said
to
him
have
whipped
him
three
times
and
shall
whip
him
no
more
we
will
buy
your
claim
he
acceded
to
the
offer
and
consented
to
resign
all
interest
and
title
in
big
rain
for
the
consideration
of
one
ten
guns
ten
chief
coats
of
scarlet
cloth
ten
pairs
of
new
leggins
and
the
same
number
of
moccasins
this
was
not
a
bad
remuneration
for
a
faithless
woman
in
another
case
an
intrigue
resulted
tragically
one
of
the
wives
of
a
minnetaree
chief
eloped
with
a
man
who
had
formerly
been
her
lover
he
deserted
her
in
a
short
time
she
returned
to
her
father
hut
whither
her
husband
traced
her
he
walked
deliberately
into
the
hut
smoked
quietly
for
a
time
and
then
took
her
by
the
hair
led
her
to
the
door
and
killed
her
with
a
single
blow
of
his
tomahawk
the
caprice
or
generosity
of
the
same
chief
gave
a
very
different
conclusion
to
a
similar
incident
which
occurred
some
time
afterward
another
of
his
wives
eloped
with
a
young
man
who
was
not
able
to
support
her
as
she
wished
and
both
returned
to
the
village
she
presented
herself
before
her
husband
and
asked
his
pardon
he
sent
for
the
man
inquired
if
they
still
loved
each
other
and
on
their
acknowledgment
gave
up
his
wife
to
her
lover
made
them
a
present
of
three
horses
and
restored
them
both
to
his
favor
with
the
exception
of
some
national
customs
the
outward
life
of
the
indian
is
generally
decent
a
temporary
interval
of
wild
license
corresponding
to
the
saturnalia
of
the
ancients
and
called
the
festival
of
dreams
is
common
among
the
canadian
tribes
this
carnival
lasts
fifteen
days
and
laying
aside
all
their
usual
gravity
they
then
commit
every
imaginable
extravagance
our
authority
does
not
say
whether
immorality
forms
a
portion
of
this
relaxation
but
from
the
custom
of
other
bands
it
is
not
improbable
lewis
and
clarke
mention
several
instances
in
which
they
were
present
at
dancing
and
similar
festivals
and
witnessed
exhibitions
of
the
most
foul
and
revolting
indecency
catlin
records
his
opinion
that
the
old
world
has
very
little
of
superior
morality
or
virtue
to
hold
as
an
example
to
the
north
american
indians
and
we
are
not
inclined
to
enter
into
any
long
comparison
of
the
races
the
manners
of
each
have
been
described
and
while
it
would
be
unjust
to
expect
the
untutored
son
of
the
forest
to
display
as
much
delicacy
as
his
more
cultivated
it
would
be
equally
ungenerous
to
assert
that
the
white
female
population
as
an
aggregate
are
governed
by
the
impulses
which
apparently
sway
the
indian
woman
but
whatever
doubts
there
may
exist
as
to
the
immorality
of
the
indian
women
in
their
natural
state
all
are
entirely
removed
as
soon
as
they
come
in
contact
with
the
white
race
those
in
the
provinces
of
nova
scotia
new
brunswick
and
canada
have
rapidly
learned
the
worst
of
vices
they
are
drunken
sensual
and
depraved
the
venereal
disease
commits
frightful
ravages
among
them
in
fact
most
of
their
sickness
arises
from
excess
of
one
kind
or
another
maclean

his
years

hudson
bay
says
that
the
men
employed
by
the
company
are
reconciled
to
their
hard
employment
and
poor
remuneration
by
the
immorality
of
the
women
of
whom
numbers
are
prostitutes
selling
themselves
for
the
smallest
remuneration
on
the
northwest

chastity
is
scarcely
even
a

the

are
the
most
licentious
and
at
some
places
where
ships
touch
for
supplies
hundreds
of
women
come
down
to
the
beach
and
by
indecent
exposures
of
their
persons
endeavor
to
obtain
permission
to
come
on
board
sir
george
simpson
received
a
visit
from
a
chief
who
wanted
to
negotiate
the
loan
of
lady
simpson
and
offered
his
squaw
in
temporary
exchange
many
of
the
traders
on
the
upper
missouri
from
motives
of
policy
connect
themselves
with
women
of
the
tribes
the
most
beautiful
girls
aspire
to
this
station
which
elevates
them
above
their
ordinary
servile
occupations
these
engagements
are
not
marriages
in
our
sense
of
the
word
a
price
is
paid
for
the
girl
and
she
is
transferred
at
once
to
the
trader
house
with
equal
facility
he
can
annul
the
contract
for
which
her
father
is
not
sorry
as
he
is
thus
enabled
to
sell
her
over
again
the
tariff
of
prices
will
range
from
two
horses
to
a
handful
of
awls
such
is
the
remuneration
for
which
an
indian
chief
will
prostitute
his
daughter
it
must
be
added
that
occasionally
the
couple
live
permanently
together
as
man
and
wife
the

of
their
doing

barbarous

west
borneo
the
relations
of
the
sexes
among
uneducated
races
are
modified
by
every
circumstance
of
their
position
but
the
natural
ascendency
of
the
strong
over
the
weak
is
universally
displayed
and
wherever
woman
is
allowed
a
social
rank
approaching
that
of
man
it
will
be
found
that
a
degree
of
civilization
has
been
attained
many
branches
of
the
human
family
have
advanced
more
or
less
beyond
the
utterly
savage
state
the
love
of
ornament
and
the
practice
of
exchange
having
raised
them
one
step
in
the
scale
while
they
vary
as
much
in
the
characteristics
of
their
barbarism
as
civilized
nations
do
in
their
refinement
waiving
generalities
a
better
idea
of
their
respective
customs
will
be
obtained
by
noticing
the
position
of
females
among
the
different
nations
africa
some
of
the
most
wild
and
savage
tribes
of
the
human
family
are
to
be
found
in
the
immense
peninsula
of
africa
observation
has
proved
that
a
medium
state
of
refinement
is
accompanied
with
the
least
immorality
and
that
it
is
among
the
merest
savages
and
the
most
communities
that
the
greatest
profligacy
exists
in
order
to
present
the
subject
clearly
we
will
make
a
geographical
arrangement
and
commencing
from
the
south
pass
over
the
continent
till
we
reach
the
valley
of
the
lower
nile
the
hottentots
are
a
dissolute
profligate
race
and
have
borne
that
character
from
the
earliest
period
it
was
remarked
by
van
riebeck
in
and
confirmed
by
colonel
napier
in
the
latter
describing
them
as
proverbially
unchaste
indecency
and
lewdness
are
their
characteristics
and
even
now
though
accustomed
to
clothing
it
is
not
uncommon
for
them
to
strip
themselves
and
dance
in
a
lascivious
manner
at
their
festivals
the
females
prostitute
themselves
readily
to
strangers
some
from
inclination
others
for
money
or
a
gift
of
finery
but
we
have
no
means
of
estimating
the
numbers
of
this
disreputable
class
a
few
of
superior
order
are
scattered
among
these
degraded
creatures
and
intelligent
and
women
have
attracted
the
notice
of
travelers
the
pastoral
kaffirs
are
more
moral
though
more
ferocious
than
the
hottentots
being
more
addicted
to
arms
and
less
to
debauch
they
practice
polygamy
buying
their
wives
for
so
many
head
of
cattle
the
girls
undergo
a
probation
before
marriage
during
which
they
are
kept
in
seclusion
as
the
tribe
wander
from
place
to
place
they
carry
their
women
with
them
and
upon
them
all
the
domestic
labor
falls
even
the
wives
assisting
in
grinding
corn
and
similar
work
divorce
is
easy
on
very
slight
grounds
we
occasionally
hear
of
women
committing
fornication
but
no
professed
class
of
prostitutes
has
been
described
marriage
is
not
held
as
a
sacred
tie
but
adultery
by
a
wife
is
severely
punished
natural
affections
appear
extremely
weak
among
the
kaffirs
and
mothers
have
but
little
attachment
to
their
children
the
sickly
and
feeble
being
sometimes
abandoned
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
rearing
them
ward
knew
of
a
woman
who
buried
alive
a
sickly
daughter
the
little
creature
was
but
imperfectly
interred
it
burst
from
the
grave
and
ran
home
a
second
time
it
was
subjected
to
the
same
torture
and
again
escaped
a
third
attempt
was
made
with
a
similar
result
when
its
mother
received
it
and
it
ultimately
recovered
such
instances
of
inhumanity
are
not
rare
husbands
frequently
drag
their
sick
wives
into
a
thicket
and
leave
them
to
die
it
is
important
to
mention
that
where
these
people
have
embraced
christianity
their
manners
have
totally
changed
polygamy
has
been
renounced
and
they
manifest
an
inclination
to
conform
to
the
morals
taught
them
between
the
tropics
the
people
are
notorious
for
licentiousness
morality
is
a
strange
idea
to
them
nor
is
a
man
restrained
by
any
social
law
from
intercourse
with
as
many
females
as
he
pleases
the
result
is
that
women
are
regarded
strictly
as
marketable
commodities
and
the
commonest
feelings
of
humanity
are
unknown
on
the
gold
coast
husbands
openly
prostitute
their
wives
for
money
in
other
places
an
adulterer
pays
a
fine
to
the
husband
and
many
urge
their
wives
to
commit
the
crime
for
the
sake
of
the
penalty
when
laird
visited
the
niger
in
he
found
the
condition
of
the
females
upon
its
borders
most
humiliating
polygamy
was
universal
and
wives
were
reduced
to
slavery
in
their
own
houses
in
short
the
race
may
be
described
as
the
most
idle
ignorant
and
profligate
in
africa
the
king
possessed
one
hundred
and
forty
wives
one
of
whom
was
under
thirteen
years
of
age
and
all
had
been
purchased
for
a
few
muskets
or
a
piece
of
cloth
half
a
dozen
of
the
fattest
were
known
as
his
favorites
and
one
of
them
was
said
to
weigh
over
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
the
mother
of
this
prince
lived
in
his
palace
and
amused
the
court
with
obscene
dances
adultery
by
any
inmate
of
the
harem
was
punished
with
death
when
a
man
died
one
at
least
of
his
wives
was
expected
to
attend
him
she
was
bound
and
thrown
into
the
river
in
another
place
the
woman
was
buried
alive
and
in
the
kingdom
of
fundal
when
a
chief
died
leaving
fifteen
wives
the
king
selected
the
ugliest
to
be
hanged
over
the
grave
and
transferred
the
remaining
fourteen
to
his
own
quarters
the
native
of
western
africa
looks
upon
his
wife
as
a
source
of
pleasure
and
gain
reckoning
her
as
property
to
the
amount
she
can
earn
with
a
strange
inconsistency
some
of
these
barbarians
profess
a
sentiment
of
attachment
the
king
of
atta
told
lander
that
he
loved
him
as
he
loved
his
wife
as
he
was
a
polygamist
it
is
to
be
assumed
the
traveler
thought
it
a
divided
affection
marriage
is
held
as
one
of
the
common
occurrences
of
life
when
a
man
is
old
enough
he
takes
a
wife
and
goes
on
adding
to
his
property
until
he
probably
owns
a
hundred
if
he
has
means
enough
to
buy
them
even
under
this
system
many
women
can
not
obtain
stated
husbands
as
some
men
will
not
take
permanent
wives
but
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
no
single
man
lives
without
female
intercourse
and
no
single
woman
remains
chaste
a
wife
suspected
of
adultery
is
forced
to
drink
a
poisonous
decoction
but
she
sometimes
bribes
the
priest
to
render
it
harmless
widows
who
have
lived
on
bad
terms
with
their
husbands
have
to
undergo
the
same
ordeal
an
illicit
connection
with
the
king
wife
results
in
death
to
both
parties
but
for
the
wife
of
a
chief
the
gift
of
a
slave
is
an
expiation
the
price
of
a
handsome
wife
is
from
eighteen
to
dollars
a
one
is
worth
about
seven
dollars
as
a
inclination
varies
he
often
sells
one
wife
and
buys
another
with
the
proceeds
of
the
transaction
in
the
kingdom
of
dahomey
once
the
centre
of
the
a
most
profligate
population
is
found
and
the
traveler
entering
its
is
immediately
struck
with
the
immodesty
of
the
women
throughout
the
country
the
same
characteristic
is
observable
they
are
profligates
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
the
king
is
superior
in
brutality
and
filthiness
traits
which
seem
hereditary
to
the
throne
of
dahomey
to
any
of
his
subjects
he
has
thousands
of
wives
his
chiefs
have
hundreds
his
subjects
tens
the
royal
favorites
are
too
sacred
for
the
gaze
of
common
people
who
must
turn
aside
or
hide
their
faces
if
any
of
them
are
passing
strangers
are
excluded
from
the
harem
but
the
privileged
nobility
attend
the
king
feasts
at
which
his
wives
take
a
leading
part
in
drinking
rum
and
conducting
the
debauch
when
the
king
desires
to
confer
honor
on
any
favorite
he
chooses
a
wife
for
him
and
presents
her
publicly
she
hands
her
husband
a
cup
of
rum
which
is
a
sign
of
union
the
king
of
dahomey
supports
an
army
of
several
thousand
amazons
who
dress
in
male
attire
do
not
marry
and
are
supposed
not
to
have
intercourse
with
men
these
troops
were
long
considered
invincible
but
a
few
years
ago
they
encountered
a
defeat
on
one
of
their
marauding
expeditions
and
a
thousand
or
more
were
killed
on
the
field
as
the
king
and

it

scarcely

so

appear
to
be

prevail
which
shock
our
ideas
of

is
usually
a
secret
crime
and
their
general
customs
with

outwardly
decent
still
the

is
degraded

are

strong
evidence
of

there
are
two
kinds
of

numerous
adulteries

rare
the

in
a
word
the
morals
of
the
country
are
of
the
lowest
description
in
the
mohammedan
states
of
the
neighborhood
the
condition
of
the
female
sex
is
also
degraded
and
if
there
is
less
general
prostitution
it
is
because
every
woman
is
the
slave
of
some
man

and
is
closely
watched
by
him

the
rank
of

the
general
demeanor
of
the

is
modest
and

our

limited
that
any
inquiry
into

but
enough
has
been
stated
to
give
a
fair
idea
of
the
average
morality
statistics
are
of
course
impossible
but
from
a
description
in
general
terms
we
can
not
hesitate
to
form
an
opinion
australasia
in
this
division
of
the
earth
surface
are
generally
included
the
great
island
of
australia
papua
or
new
guinea
and
some
adjacent
islands
comprising
new
caledonia
and
van
diemen
land
politically
and
geographically
the
islands
of
new
zealand
are
also
in
this
division
but
there
is
some
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
this
distribution
for
ethnographical
purposes
opinions
vary
as
to
the
state
of
the
new
zealanders
there
is
much
similarity
between
them
and
the
inhabitants
of
some
of
the
polynesian
islands
while
there
are
equally
strong
points
of
resemblance
between
them
and
the
australian
aborigines
the
new
zealander
when
discovered
by
cook
was
far
superior
to
the
australian
in
intelligence
and
in
the
arts
of
life
he
inhabited
a
decent
hut
could
build
a
stockade
fort
and
lived
upon
cooked
food
the
australian
lived
in
a
hollow
tree
could
put
together
a
temporary
hut
made
of
bark
and
brush
and
fed
upon
grubs
roots
and
raw
flesh
among
such
a
race
as
the
australian
blacks
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
position
occupied
by
women
was
of
the
most
degrading
and
brutal
character
the
australian
savage
does
not
even
pay
his
future
spouse
the
compliment
of
wooing
her
might
makes
right
in
their
case
the
woman
is
often
betrothed
by
her
parent
or
kinsman
and
becomes
her
husband
property
by
sale
and
bargain
if
this
has
not
been
effected
in
the
usual
way
he
acquires
his
marital
privileges
by
an
inroad
on
the
grounds
of
another
tribe
and
then
meeting
a
woman
he
knocks
her
down
with
his
a
heavy
club
and
carries
her
to
a
place
of
security
where
he
makes
himself
master
of
her
person
by
force
this
indeed
is
so
usual
a
course
of
procedure
that
it
has
given
rise
to
a
belief
that
the
australian
rival
bachelors
compete
for
a
wife
by
knocking
her
on
the
head
and
whoever
fells
her
bears
away
the
belle
the
habits
of
the
native
australians
are
not
so
observable
now
as
they
were
at
the
commencement
of
the
system
of
colonization
at
first
a
continual
intercourse
was
kept
up
between
them
and
the
settlers
the
reciprocal
injuries
inflicted
upon
each
other
in
which
the
whites
were
more
to
blame
than
the
natives
brought
about
an
exterminating
warfare
the
black
race
has
gradually
wasted
away
from
the
settled
or
rather
partially
settled
country
while
the
interior
tribes
have
retreated
in
south
australia
new
south
wales
and
victoria
far
into
the
wilderness
beyond
ordinary
communication
with
the
white
man
in
van
diemen
land
the
natives
were
almost
extirpated
by
the
constant
warfare
carried
on
between
them
and
the
settlers
convict
as
well
as
free
and
the
government
was
obliged
to
take
the
few
survivors
under
its
protection
and
to
establish
a
place
of
refuge
for
them
they
were
accordingly
collected
and
deported
to
an
island
in
bass
straits
under
the
charge
of
a
special
commissioner
but
notwithstanding
the
increased
comforts
of
their
condition
and
their
immunity
from
the
murderous
hostility
of
their
white
foes
they
have
languished
and
instead
of
the
population
increasing
it
has
gradually
decreased
until
at
the
present
time
it
is
believed
that
the
numbers
are
under
one
hundred
in
central
australia
north
of
the
murray
the
tribes
are
still
comparatively
numerous
and
in
some
cases
warlike
and
hostile
to
settlers
the
married
women
among
the
aborigines
are
called
gins
and
the
single
girls
lubbras
the
women
follow
their
lords
on
their
migrations
and
excursions
carry
the
loads
and
do
all
the
work
they
bear
patiently
and
submissively
the
blows
and
to
which
they
are
subject
polygamy
is
practiced
by
the
more
powerful
men
of
the
tribes
who
appropriate
to
themselves
such
women
as
they
choose
and
cast
them
off
at
pleasure
now
and
then
they
sell
or
present
a
gin
to
a
friend
in
want
of
such
a
commodity
there
is
considerable
disproportion
between
the
sexes
attributable
partly
to
continual
partly
to
the
habit
prevalent
among
savage
nations
of
destroying
female
infants
at
one
time
in
the
history
of
these
colonies
the
outlying
and
shepherds
occasionally
endeavored
to
solace
their
loneliness
with
a
lubbra
whom
they
had
managed
to
decoy
from
her
lawful
owner
but
the
from
such
unions
are
very
rare
the
natives
notwithstanding
the
low
estimate
they
have
of
their
women
are
exceedingly
jealous
of
them
as
property
and
keep
them
away
as
much
as
possible
from
the
stations
chastity
is
at
all
times
of
little
account
among
savages
always
excepting
the
old
celts
and
teutons
who
held
continence
in
high
esteem
and
whose
women
were
objects
of
general
respect
from
the
peculiar
habits
of
the
australian
aborigines
themselves
it
can
scarcely
be
said
that
prostitution
exists
as
an
institution
the
woman
has
no
choice
in
the
matter
as
between
the
gins
and
lubbras
and
the
white
settlers
there
is
scarcely
any
chance
for
prostitution
a
woman
now
and
then
visits
the
towns
or
settlements
but
always
in
company
with
her
male
friends
when
quite
young
the
girls
are
not
more
disagreeable
than
others
of
their
complexion
when
more
advanced
in
years
they
are
absolutely
repulsive
and
are
rendered
hideous
by
scars
and
other
evidences
of
brutality
at
all
times
both
sexes
are
loathsome
in
their
persons
and
are
clad
in
filthy
blankets
or
unless
when
they
can
pick
up
tattered
remnants
of
european
clothing
among
the
new
zealanders
the
state
of
the
women
was
a
little
better
than
among
the
australians
the
amelioration
was
rather
in
degree
than
principle
they
were
subject
to
the
same
control
by
parents
and
kinsmen
they
were
disposed
of
in
marriage
as
matter
of
right
and
were
often
betrothed
from
infancy
in
which
case
they
were
or
to
other
persons
than
the
young
chief
or
warrior
who
had
purchased
the
reversion
cruel
punishments
of
the
women
for
infidelity
were
general
and
even
for
minor
offenses
they
were
subject
to
very
severe
chastisement
in
one
case
even
recently
a
new
zealand
woman
was
suspended
by
the
heels
naked
and
in
that
position
unmercifully
whipped
her
sense
of
the
outrage
was
so
keen
that
she
committed
suicide
licentiousness
among
the
women
was
probably
more
rare
formerly
than
now
adultery
was
punished
in
both
parties
by
death
and
the
family
of
the
male
offender
were
often
involved
in
the
punishment
now
however
the
constant
visits
of
whalers
and
seafaring
men
the
gradual
settlement
of
whites
in
the
islands
and
above
all
the
profits
and
advantages
derivable
from
illicit
intercourse
cause
the
women
to
be
free
of
their
persons
parents
and
even
husbands
are
oftentimes
the
principal
gainers
by
the
transaction
and
even
negotiate
the
profit
to
be
made
the
marriage
ceremony
too
was
formerly
of
so
easy
a
character
that
whatever
the
new
zealand
woman
might
have
thought
of
it
no
settler
and
especially
no
seaman
would
feel
himself
bound
by
the
tie
and
although
associations
based
on
this
weak
bond
were
not
wrong
in
the
woman
they
paved
the
way
for
less
excusable
relations
the
influence
of
civilized
institutions
and
the
presence
of
a
regular
clergy
and
missionaries
is
effecting
some
improvement
in
native
morals
and
many
lawful
marriages
have
taken
place
between
the
whites
and
the
native
women
the
offspring
of
which
a
fine
race
of
may
be
met
with
throughout
the
australian
colonies
the
example
of
the
consideration
in
which
the
native
women
thus
married
are
held
and
the
rights
and
social
position
that
they
acquire
is
not
without
influence
on
others
and
predisposes
them
to
the
same
course
among
the
tribes
removed
from
the
coast
and
withdrawn
from
civilized
control
the
ancient
customs
are
still
kept
up
in
their
integrity
and
the
chiefs
and
natives
jealously
resist
all
encroachments
on
their
independence
among
those
chiefs
even
who
have
been
converted
to
a
nominal
christianity
rauperaha
for
instance
heathen
institutions
of
revenge
for
injury
polygamy
power
of
life
and
death
over
their
wives
and
followers
are
maintained
and
the
humanizing
lessons
of
the
gospel
have
made
but
little
way
toward
an
amendment
of
their
barbarous
lives
in
new
zealand
it
is
asserted
that
the
venereal
disease
is
very
prevalent
among
the
natives
and
from
their
diet
and
licentious
habits
is
often
fatal
in
colonial
white
society
there
are
no
particular
incidents
to
characterize
prostitution
at
all
times
during
the
continuance
of
transportation
female
immorality
has
been
very
prevalent
the
general
law
so
often
observed
as
attendant
upon
irregularity
of
the
sexes
has
been
powerfully
operative
besides
there
have
been
local
influences
at
work
to
deteriorate
female
manners
the
large
importations
of
convict
women
who
were
always
the
most
unruly
and
vicious
of
the
felon
population
and
who
notoriously
gave
more
trouble
and
vexation
to
the
authorities
than
any
one
else
was
prejudicial
to
public
virtue
just
however
as
on
account
of
these
faults
women
of
indifferent
character
were
lightly
esteemed
so
did
the
respectable
females
gain
in
public
opinion
however
poor
their
worldly
condition
there
was
not
much
regular
prostitution
although
incontinence
prevailed
there
was
a
continual
system
of
marriage
going
on
among
the
convicts
when
a
man
chose
to
marry
he
brushed
himself
up
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
went
to
the
nearest
superintendent
to
whom
he
intimated
his
desire
for
matrimony
permission
was
always
given
the
eligibles
at
the
station
were
forwarded
for
his
inspection
and
the
selected
one
rarely
refused
inasmuch
as
her
connubial
bonds
relieved
her
during
good
behavior
from
the
more
galling
bondage
of
the
law
some
of
these
unions
turned
out
more
satisfactorily
than
might
have
been
expected
from
the
character
of
the
parties
especially
of
the
women
south
australia
and
the
gold
colony
of
victoria
never
were
penal
settlements
the
deficiency
of
respectable
young
women
was
very
much
felt
by
the
colonists
and
the
home
government
made
many
efforts
to
supply
the
want
a
large
number
of
young
women
went
out
from
great
britain
under
the
charge
of
matrons
and
medical
officers
and
in
the
majority
of
cases
their
arrival
was
hailed
with
great
satisfaction
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
a
young
man
a
settler
far
away
up
the
country
to
come
down
to
the
government
depôts
at
adelaide
or
melbourne
on
the
arrival
of
a
female
emigrant
ship
and
then
and
there
to
pick
out
his
partner
for
life
of
course
the
greater
number
were
hired
out
to
service
by
the
colonists
and
in
the
order
of
events
passed
from
service
to
independence
parental
care
and
precaution
were
exercised
by
the
authorities
over
the
young
women
thus
sent
abroad
they
were
not
allowed
to
hire
into
or
the
parties
who
hired
them
required
to
be
known
they
had
liberty
to
remain
at
the
depôt
for
some
months
if
not
suited
and
for
any
length
of
time
in
case
of
sickness
on
arrival
and
afterward
during
good
conduct
the
depôt
was
an
asylum
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
notwithstanding
all
these
safeguards
there
was
a
constant
supply
of
prostitution
the
good
intentions
of
the
emigration
commissioners
in
london
were
too
frequently
neutralized
by
the
depraved
character
of
officers
of
the
vessels
in
which
females
were
sent
or
by
the
interested
conduct
of
the
local
authorities
in
england
a
good
reputation
was
essential
to
the
intending
emigrant
but
frequently
masters
of
and
parish
officers
shipped
off
unworthy
or
troublesome
characters
who
were
better
got
rid
of
at
any
price
during
the
gold
mania
prostitution
in
australia
was
rampant
the
enormous
gains
and
flaunting
extravagance
were
a
great
temptation
to
young
women
who
could
not
readily
suit
themselves
with
situations
and
who
disliked
the
moderate
restraints
of
the
depôt
the
persuasive
arts
of
the
procuress
and
were
not
wanting
it
was
a
singular
fact
that
at
one
time
all
the
public
vehicles
were
owned
by
the
profits
of
these
joint
callings
were
perfectly
fabulous
it
was
an
sight
to
see
a
party
of
prostitutes
in
the
most
gaudy
costumes
parading
the
streets
in
open
carriages
indeed
it
was
generally
understood
to
be
part
of
their
contract
that
they
should
have
unlimited
clothing
of
the
most
garish
colors
and
style
and
expensive
material
and
also
sunday
rides
in
open
carriages
the
police
authorities
did
what
they
could
to
check
this
shameful
display
but
they
were
powerless
before
the
reckless
extravagance
of
the
miners
and
the
influx
of
women
it
is
believed
that
this
excess
has
now
toned
down
and
miners
having
taken
to
buying
land
and
to
marriage
order
is
once
more
resuming
sway
and
prostitution
in
the
gold
colonies
though
not
at
an
end
is
much

these
last
have
been
rendered
famous
of
late
years
by
hermann
melville
typee
and
omoo
the
south
sea
islands
were
usually
depicted
in
the
most
glowing
colors
by
early
navigators
the
lands
were
the
fairest
on
earth
surface
the
climate
was
unsurpassed
combining
the
genial
warmth
of
the
tropics
with
the
fresh
breezes
of
ocean
the
soil
spontaneously
bringing
forth
in
luxuriant
abundance
the
loveliest
and
most
valuable
vegetable
productions
and
finally
the
inhabitants
were
fitted
both
in
person
and
disposition
to
tenant
such
an
eden
it
is
easy
to
comprehend
the
frame
of
mind
which
led
to
these
descriptions
the
seaman
after
wandering
over
the
pathless
ocean
with
only
the
dark
waste
of
waters
in
view
might
well
recognize
a
paradise
in
the
green
hills
and
shady
groves
of
the
islands
of
the
pacific
and
angels
in
their
dusky
denizens
but
these
pictures
were
eminently
fallacious
the
virtues
of
savage
life
disappear
on
close
acquaintanceship
implacable
ferocity
among
themselves
sanguinary
and
exterminating
warfare
cannibalism
unbounded
licentiousness
and
its
concomitants
of
unnatural
lust
and
lasciviousness
debasing
and
horrid
idolatry
infanticide
the
most
grinding
tyranny
of
the
strong
over
the
weak
and
of
the
man
over
the
woman
who
is
not
permitted
to
live
in
the
same
dwelling
eat
the
same
food
cook
at
the
same
fire
or
even
use
the
same
dish
as
her
lord
and
master
these
enormities
are
the
ordinary
conditions
of
savage
life
some
local
modifications
may
be
found
but
such
were
the
main
incidents
in
polynesian
life
and
character
it
is
true
that
in
the
first
instance
the
natives
received
the
whites
with
all
friendship
and
evinced
toward
their
visitors
much
hospitality
and
gentleness
of
demeanor
this
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
wonder
and
reverence
with
which
they
regarded
foreigners
looking
on
them
as
superior
beings
of
another
sphere
and
awestruck
at
their
wonderful
powers
at
the
astonishing
engines
they
wielded
and
managed
and
at
their
unknown
attributes
but
familiarity
lessened
respect
some
and
unjustifiable
tyranny
brought
out
the
offensive
points
of
savage
character
and
theft
treachery
and
murder
were
soon
practiced
as
freely
against
the
whites
as
against
each
other
whenever
fear
of
consequences
did
not
restrain
them
the
murder
of
captain
cook
and
the
attack
on
la
perouse
were
remarkable
cases
on
account
of
the
boldness
of
the
savages
and
the
public
loss
in
the
death
of
the
great
navigator
but
they
were
not
isolated
outrages
many
a
small
and
vessel
perished
among
the
islands
and
on
repeated
occasions
when
landings
were
effected
the
mariners
ran
great
risks
from
the
uncertain
despotism
of
the
natives
whatever
may
have
been
their
other
qualities
either
among
themselves
or
in
their
intercourse
with
foreigners
licentiousness
was
the
universal
characteristic
of
the
south
sea
islanders
it
was
not
merely
polygamy
or
excess
among
a
few
of
the
more
powerful
members
of
the
community
but
the
ordinary
habit
among
all
classes
chastity
whenever
met
with
was
not
a
customary
part
of
woman
life
but
only
an
incident
dependent
on
particular
circumstances
in
fact
an
abnormal
condition
it
was
associated
with
either
marriage
or
betrothal
a
peculiar
institution
of
all
these
islanders
was
the
or
a
ceremony
performable
either
by
priest
or
chief
whereby
places
persons
or
property
could
be
rendered
unapproachable
by
other
than
the
lawful
owner
the
breach
of
this
law
has
always
been
the
greatest
violation
of
propriety
and
public
feeling
of
which
a
native
or
foreigner
could
be
guilty
when
young
girls
were
betrothed
at
an
early
age
either
to
boys
of
corresponding
years
or
to
older
persons
such
females
were
this
insured
chastity
until
they
had
reached
a
marriageable
age
as
this
betrothal
system
was
almost
exclusively
confined
to
chiefs
it
follows
that
the
obligation
to
chastity
was
very
limited
the
farther
inference
would
be
that
chastity
was
associated
rather
with
property
in
the
female
than
propriety
in
the
woman
another
institution
of
the
south
sea
islanders
was
that
of
the
these
were
a
body
of
men
and
women
banded
together
for
certain
purposes
which
had
originally
been
of
a
religious
character
they
had
probably
been
once
men
or
wizards
as
among
the
negroes
and
indians
the
custom
so
often
observable
among
heathen
nations
of
incorporating
amusements
and
festivities
into
religious
rites
had
been
taken
up
by
these
areoi
and
in
process
of
time
they
degenerated
into
mere
mimes
or
buffoons
and
yet
preserved
to
themselves
by
prescriptive
right
all
the
immunities
and
privileges
otherwise
accorded
to
priests
they
traveled
about
from
place
to
place
and
sometimes
from
island
to
island
their
observances
yet
retained
a
trace
of
their
religious
origin
inasmuch
as
they
commenced
with
a
sacrifice
to
the
gods
after
which
they
entertained
the
people
with
theatrical
performances
in
which
obscene
songs
and
lascivious
dances
formed
the
chief
features
they
gave
dialogues
and
recitations
in
which
they
freely
satirized
all
classes
not
excepting
the
priests
they
were
every
where
gladly
received
and
had
a
right
to
free
quarters
wherever
they
stopped
it
is
said
the
members
were
usually
the
handsomest
of
both
sexes
the
women
being
the
most
profligate
among
the
inhabitants
tradition
maintained
that
these
persons
had
been
originally
incorporated
by
the
gods
and
that
one
of
their
rules
was
perpetual
celibacy
and
that
they
should
have
no
descendants
this
though
it
might
perhaps
in
the
outset
have
been
a
prohibition
intended
for
pure
purposes
has
ended
in
the
perversion
of
such
an
intention
in
their
present
condition
whether
degenerate
or
not
the
inhibition
is
not
taken
to
exclude
them
from
sexual
intercourse
and
enjoyment
but
from
its
natural
consequences
their
lives
were
accordingly
most
abandoned
and
abortion
and
infanticide
were
invariably
practiced
nor
were
their
enormities
confined
to
their
own
body
after
their
representations
the
wildest
excesses
were
perpetrated
in
all
quarters
resistance
or
retaliation
was
impossible
by
the
sufferer
on
account
of
the
fear
these
wretches
excited
by
the
mysterious
powers
with
which
they
were
accredited
and
which
were
in
reality
the
secret
affiliations
of
all
the
bands
when
performing
the
areoi
painted
their
bodies
black
and
their
faces
scarlet
they
wore
dresses
of
plants
and
flowers
they
were
divided
into
several
classes
named
after
some
particular
ornament
and
taking
into
account
the
subordinate
members
of
the
troops
and
the
attendants
who
performed
the
menial
offices
they
must
have
been
exceedingly
numerous
places
were
specially
built
for
their
reception
and
for
the
greater
convenience
of
their
representations
candidates
for
admission
into
their
number
were
received
by
secret
ceremonies
akin
to
the
mysteries
of
paganism
solemnities
intended
to
awe
the
vulgar
were
performed
and
the
idea
of
special
reservation
of
the
blessings
of
a
future
elysium
to
these
deceivers
was
promulgated
and
believed
the
existence
of
such
organized
societies
could
not
but
be
in
the
highest
degree
subversive
to
all
order
and
decency
accordingly
when
the
missionaries
first
arrived
they
found
the
general
depravity
of
morals
the
greatest
difficulty
they
had
to
encounter
obscenity
libidinousness
and
incontinence
were
so
ingrafted
into
the
very
nature
of
the
people
that
they
seemed
almost
ineradicable
accordingly
we
find
it
narrated
of
an
intelligent
convert
that
he
expressed
his
conviction
that
the
people
ought
to
be
induced
to
discontinue
infanticide
human
sacrifice
and
demon
worship
but
that
preservation
of
female
virtue
and
christian
marriage
would
never
be
obtained
the
society
islands
are
said
to
have
been
formerly
proverbial
even
in
polynesia
for
the
licentiousness
which
is
still
remarkably
prevalent
among
them
the
missionary
regulations
have
apparently
mitigated
the
evils
and
they
have
succeeded
in
establishing
laws
on
the
subject
which
are
not
however
binding
upon
strangers
the
foreigners
who
come
to
these
islands
while
denouncing
the
conduct
of
the
inhabitants
are
too
often
the
chief
instigators
to
vice
and
finding
themselves
checked
in
their
misconduct
they
vent
their
disappointment
on
the
missionaries
the
foreign
influences
at
work
in
these
islands
are
of
a
nature
one
striving
for
the
improvement
of
the
natives
and
the
inculcation
of
virtuous
principles
and
the
encouragement
or
enforcement
of
virtuous
practices
the
other
including
all
the
base
and
sordid
passions
and
motives
of
seamen
and
whalers
bent
on
the
reckless
enjoyment
of
the
passing
hour
of
traders
and
adventurers
eager
in
quest
of
gain
and
among
the
worst
specimens
of
runaway
seamen
and
even
convicts
from
the
australian
settlements
all
these
influences
combine
to
check
the
advancement
of
the
natives
the
beauty
of
the
women
in
these
islands
has
been
much
exaggerated
commodore
wilkes
says
i
did
not
see
among
them
a
single
woman
whom
i
could
call
handsome
they
have
indeed
a
certain
sleepiness
about
the
eyes
which
may
be
fascinating
to
some
but
i
should
rather
ascribe
the
celebrity
which
their
charms
have
acquired
among
navigators
to
their
cheerfulness
and
gayety
others
who
visit
them
with
equally
cool
judgment
tell
us
that
they
were
disappointed
in
their
appearance
for
there
were
few
who
could
be
called
handsome
nevertheless
they
had
eminent
feminine
graces
their
manners
being
affable
and
engaging
their
step
easy
and
graceful
their
behavior
free
and
unguarded
their
temper
mild
gentle
and
unaffected
slow
to
take
offense
easily
pacified
seldom
retaining
resentment
or
revenge
whatever
the
provocation
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
their
demeanor
was
winning
and
affable
and
their
conduct
sportive
and
playful
their
industry
was
not
very
great
the
few
wants
of
the
islanders
being
amply
supplied
by
nature
the
women
prepared
the
poe
from
the
and
the
ava
and
till
europeans
introduced
the
hog
this
was
their
usual
diet
if
we
except
the
cannibal
feasts
of
the
warriors
in
which
the
women
took
no
part
the
female
occupations
were
weaving
flowers
and
grasses
into
garlands
and
mats
their
chief
amusement
was
paddling
the
canoe
or
sporting
in
the
surf
for
all
the
islanders
took
to
the
water
and
the
women
were
perhaps
from
the
greater
buoyancy
of
their
persons
better
swimmers
than
the
men
before
the
arrival
of
the
missionaries
it
was
customary
for
the
women
to
swim
out
to
a
ship
and
swarm
on
board
where
scenes
of
debauchery
and
indecency
commenced
lasting
as
long
as
the
vessel
lay
in
the
harbor
and
the
fascination
of
which
worked
so
powerfully
on
the
excited
passions
of
the
seamen
that
desertions
and
mutiny
were
continually
occurring
the
earliest
intercourse
of
whites
has
never
yet
been
beneficial
to
the
untutored
savage
and
had
these
occurrences
only
taken
place
on
board
the
ships
of
foreigners
it
might
have
been
laid
to
the
account
of
foreign
corruption
but
this
was
not
the
case
the
gains
derivable
from
the
white
men
visits
might
give
profligacy
a
greater
zest
for
both
sexes
of
the
natives
for
indiscriminate
intercourse
was
a
institution
ere
yet
the
european
came
the
south
sea
islanders
are
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
keeping
their
women
in
a
subordinate
and
inferior
condition
a
chief
is
sometimes
and
his
women
may
not
approach
him
he
may
see
them
when
he
pleases
at
all
times
the
woman
is
in
bondage
those
of
the
chief
live
in
separate
apartments
from
their
master
and
are
not
permitted
to
associate
with
him
on
equal
terms
excepting
when
the
female
is
of
high
blood
in
this
case
she
is
perfectly
independent
can
exercise
the
same
powers
as
her
husband
and
in
some
particulars
can
even
throw
off
her
allegiance
to
him
polygamy
was
and
still
is
practiced
among
the
chiefs
even
where
missionary
influences
have
been
successful
the
chiefs
look
upon
the
abolition
of
polygamy
as
a
most
objectionable
innovation
they
look
back
to
their
past
liberty
with
regret
and
can
not
understand
why
they
are
restricted
to
one
wife
polygamy
could
of
course
only
be
practiced
by
the
powerful
at
the
expense
of
the
weak
already
from
various
causes
operating
among
savages
there
was
a
preponderance
of
males
over
females
rendered
still
more
great
by
polygamy
this
again
depreciated
female
virtue
justifying
illicit
intercourse
to
those
who
lived
in
forced
celibacy
and
in
its
consequences
came
concealment
and
infanticide
to
such
an
extent
was
illicit
intercourse
carried
that
some
writers
assert
that
no
girl
ever
reached
the
age
of
puberty
a
virgin
the
nature
of
the
marriage
bond
is
very
uncertain
the
husband
could
get
rid
of
the
wife
at
pleasure
there
seems
to
have
been
a
slight
distinction
between
marriage
and
concubinage
most
of
these
social
institutions
are
extended
over
all
the
islands
alike
with
very
few
local
differences
infanticide
for
example
has
been
practiced
in
most
of
the
islands
but
not
invariably
so
at
tutuila
one
of
the
samoan
group
it
had
never
obtained
circumcision
was
common
among
most
of
the
natives
among
the
samoans
the
women
are
treated
with
consideration
the
men
do
all
the
hard
work
even
to
cooking
while
the
women
perform
only
labor
attend
to
the
children
and
prepare
the
food
for
the
fire
in
the
sandwich
islands
there
is
no
such
chivalrous
sentiment
at
the
arrival
of
the
missionaries
there
were
no
marriage
institutions
among
them
the
only
laws
were
such
as
to
regulate
somewhat
their
licentiousness
there
were
traditions
to
show
that
at
some
past
time
before
the
discovery
of
the
island
the
marriage
tie
had
been
held
in
respect
by
the
natives
and
that
the
marriage
ceremony
had
been
an
important
one
at
present
personal
chastisement
of
the
wife
by
her
husband
is
not
infrequent
and
it
is
spoken
of
by
them
as
a
matter
of
course
the
relations
of
parents
to
children
differed
much
at
different
periods
the
samoans
seem
to
have
been
the
most
observant
of
moral
obligations
and
natural
ties
among
them
it
was
the
usage
of
the
mothers
to
suckle
the
children
for
several
years
and
to
bring
them
up
with
great
care
and
attention
so
much
so
that
a
crippled
child
was
sometimes
discreditable
as
evincing
a
degree
of
culpable
carelessness
in
the
mother
the
society
and
sandwich
islanders
whose
lives
were
habitually
dissolute
shunned
all
trouble
which
interfered
with
their
freedom
of
intercourse
and
children
were
considered
especially
burdensome
infanticide
prevailed
to
a
frightful
extent
among
them
and
as
if
the
ordinary
dissoluteness
of
the
people
had
not
been
ample
inducement
to
this
most
flagitious
crime
the
tyranny
of
the
rulers
invented
a
in
whose
operation
children
over
ten
were
included
the
poorer
inhabitants
of
these
blissful
regions
who
already
felt
the
rod
of
oppression
too
severely
found
in
this
an
additional
motive
to
but
in
its
operation
it
was
even
more
cruel
than
infanticide
for
many
children
who
had
been
suffered
to
live
were
put
to
death
as
they
approached
the
period
when
they
would
be
liable
to
taxation
the
murder
was
consummated
sometimes
by
the
parents
at
times
mercifully
and
at
times
horribly
there
were
a
class
of
persons
who
practiced
professionally
in
the
samoan
group
the
girls
are
often
early
betrothed
without
reference
to
years
the
girl
being
taboo
until
of
marriageable
age
during
the
intervening
period
the
bridegroom
accumulates
property
the
marriage
festival
is
held
with
all
circumstances
of
uproar
and
debauchery
and
the
guests
stay
as
long
as
there
is
any
thing
to
eat
the
consummation
of
the
marriage
and
the
virginity
of
the
bride
are
published
by
the
proofs
required
in
the
jewish
law
when
a
man
in
this
group
wishes
to
take
a
wife
he
must
ask
the
consent
this
obtained
he
presents
to
the
girl
of
his
choice
a
basket
of
by
accepting
which
she
accepts
the
donor
the
husband
then
pays
the
parents
a
sum
of
money
for
her
according
to
her
rank
and
estimation
sometimes
the
courtship
is
to
the
family
without
consulting
the
girl
who
is
expected
to
conform
to
her
parents
will
in
the
matter
a
samoan
may
repudiate
his
wife
and
marry
again
on
certain
conditions
but
the
woman
may
not
leave
her
husband
without
his
consent
adultery
among
the
samoans
was
formerly
punished
by
death
and
the
marriage
vow
is
strictly
observed
by
them
it
is
considered
highly
discreditable
for
a
young
woman
to
form
a
connection
with
a
native
before
marriage
although
temporary
intercourse
with
a
foreigner
is
not
considered
objectionable
it
may
be
that
such
a
distinction
is
in
compliment
to
the
conceded
superiority
of
the
white
but
the
explanation
of
a
chief
would
rather
put
the
question
on
convenience
than
morality
for
he
objected
to
native
young
men
as
always
hanging
about
the
premises
and
attaching
themselves
to
the
young
woman
whereas
the
foreigner
gave
his
presents
and
sailed
away
when
the
period
of
his
stay
was
ended
leaving
the
object
of
his
choice
free
again
the
marquesas
islands
have
a
singular
institution
similar
to
one
prevalent
among
the
ancient
lacedæmonians
a
woman
has
more
than
one
husband
this
has
been
called
polyandrism
but
it
does
not
seem
precisely
such
a
wife
of
a
young
warrior
unknown
to
fame
is
honored
by
the
advances
of
a
more
distinguished
individual
by
whom
children
may
be
begotten
the
superior
chief
takes
the
wife
and
her
lawful
husband
under
his
protection
and
into
his
hut
the
population
of
some
of
the
districts
in
the
sandwich
islands
is
rapidly
decreasing
by
a
register
kept
in
hawaii
it
appears
there
are
three
deaths
to
one
birth
this
disproportion
is
attributed
to
low
habit
of
body
the
consequence
of
venereal
disease
syphilis
was
introduced
into
these
islands
by
cook
expedition
and
the
whole
of
the
natives
in
some
districts
are
now
said
to
be
reduced
to
a
morbid
sickly
state
many
of
the
women
being
incapable
of
and
but
few
of
the
children
attaining
maturity
there
are
other
concurrent
causes
to
contribute
toward
this
decay
among
which
the
difference
of
food
and
the
introduction
of
clothing
and
consequent
diminution
of
ablution
among
a
people
who
spent
half
their
lives
in
the
water
are
not
unimportant
but
the
district
of
hanapepe
where
the
decrease
was
most
rapid
was
that
in
which
the
virus
was
first
introduced
and
here
it
is
still
most
virulent
in
its
action
and
effects
whatever
the
causes
the
same
effect
is
in
powerful
operation
though
not
to
the
same
depopulating
extent
in
other
places
at
waialua
in
the
population
was
in
it
had
fallen
to
there
had
been
no
war
nor
epidemic
it
was
the
ordinary
condition
of
the
people
sterility
and
abortion
are
considered
the
most
potent
causes
abortion
is
very
common
and
there
are
cases
in
which
women
have
had
six
or
seven
and
sometimes
ten
in
as
many
years
and
no
children
personal
and
mutual
abuse
had
been
much
practiced
in
early
life
among
the
settlers
and
is
a
cause
of
sterility
previous
to
infanticide
was
as
we
have
shown
common
but
here
as
elsewhere
the
marriage
regulations
which
have
been
enforced
by
the
missionaries
and
adopted
by
the
converted
natives
are
already
operating
in
a
reactionary
manner
against
the
decrease
of
population
and
infanticide
is
almost
unknown
the
for
children
over
ten
years
of
age
has
been
repealed
and
in
its
stead
premiums
are
given
for
rearing
large
families
of
legitimate
children
it
is
admitted
by
all
that
licentiousness
prevails
extensively
among
the
people
even
at
present
but
to
a
far
less
degree
than
formerly
when
promiscuous
intercourse
was
universal
men
were
living
with
several
wives
and
all
improvement
in
this
respect
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
labors
of
christian
missionaries
to
them
the
sandwich
islanders
owe
their
moral
code
and
the
enactment
of
laws
respecting
marriage
as
well
as
their
political
institutions
the
observance
of
outward
morality
and
decency
of
behavior
has
as
we
have
mentioned
been
made
compulsory
in
those
islands
in
which
the
missionaries
have
permanently
fixed
themselves
and
acquired
sufficient
power
to
make
their
regulations
respected
they
have
interdicted
public
gatherings
for
the
purpose
of
amusement
and
even
suppressed
private
games
and
diversions
this
has
been
objected
to
as
an
interference
with
innocent
recreation
and
pastime
and
as
encouraging
formalism
but
the
missionaries
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
paganism
was
deeply
rooted
in
the
daily
life
and
habits
of
the
people
in
all
religious
festivals
feasting
dancing
and
diversion
formed
so
prominent
a
part
that
the
only
method
of
eradicating
the
attachment
of
the
people
to
their
heathen
practices
was
to
abolish
the
usages
which
made
the
worship
attractive
the
dances
are
always
immodest
often
lascivious
and
grossly
indecent
they
consist
of
little
more
than
contortions
and
twistings
of
the
limbs
and
body
and
of
throwing
themselves
into
postures
which
as
they
are
mostly
performed
by
females
are
highly
conducive
to
immorality
even
among
the
samoans
the
dances
as
performed
by
the
women
are
of
the
same
libidinous
character
with
the
others
though
the
dances
of
the
men
are
not
indecorous
the
diseases
generally
prevalent
are
skin
affections
from
the
delightful
climate
and
simple
diet
of
the
people
these
are
not
of
a
very
severe
character
the
islanders
have
been
no
gainers
in
this
respect
by
their
intercourse
with
europeans
the
venereal
disease
has
been
introduced
and
from
the
deficiency
of
medical
treatment
makes
great
ravages
secondary
syphilis
is
sometimes
severe
at
tutuila
one
of
the
samoan
group
it
is
said
that
venereal
disease
is
entirely
unknown
while
in
the
other
islands
of
the
group
it
is
very
rare
political
circumstances
the
introduction
of
new
elements
into
polynesian
life
the
daily
increasing
intercourse
between
the
islanders
and
foreigners
all
contribute
to
make
the
alterations
in
the
social
aspects
of
the
south
sea
islands
very
rapid
so
that
every
year
may
work
new
changes
some
recent
writers
affect
to
doubt
the
benefits
of
missionary
labors
among
the
islanders
who
as
they
say
have
been
thereby
diverted
from
their
innocent
and
simple
habits
of
life
in
place
of
which
it
is
alleged
a
harsh
and
hypocritical
austerity
has
been
adopted
the
purity
of
their
morals
and
the
vigor
of
their
constitutions
have
been
sapped
and
destroyed
by
the
contact
with
europeans
and
americans
and
the
whole
result
of
foreign
intercourse
has
been
unmixed
evil
we
reject
these
conclusions
as
savoring
too
strongly
of
party
prejudice
and
class
antipathies
the
tendency
of
the
gospel
always
is
to
purify
and
elevate
savage
tribes
the
missionaries
have
perhaps
overestimated
and
overstated
the
extent
of
benefit
accomplished
by
them
and
the
gayety
and
cheerfulness
so
pleasing
in
appearance
to
the
casual
visitor
yet
so
deceptive
in
reality
may
have
been
diminished
but
the
purity
of
savage
life
is
a
delusion
and
something
has
been
achieved
if
only
an
outward
conformity
to
the
laws
and
dictates
of
christianity
has
been
produced
west
indies
a
very
slight
notice
of
the
west
indies
will
suffice
for
of
the
savage
races
scarcely
a
vestige
remains
of
the
negro
population
a
general
view
is
all
that
is
required
and
the
civilized
colonists
retain
so
much
of
the
impress
of
the
countries
whence
they
came
as
to
require
no
special
remarks
when
columbus
first
visited
these
beautiful
islands
he
found
them
inhabited
by
two
classes
of
men
the
savage
caribs
who
delighted
in
war
and
preyed
upon
the
weaker
tribes
and
the
simple
communities
whose
pacific
habits
made
them
victims
of
their
violent
neighbors
the
people
were
alike
distinct
in
the
treatment
of
women
the
peaceful
islanders
admitted
females
to
a
participation
in
all
the
delights
of
their
rural
life
allowing
them
to
mingle
in
the
dance
to
inherit
power
and
to
share
all
their
pleasures
among
the
cannibal
caribs
a
different
fashion
prevailed
the
handsomest
of
their
were
retained
as
slaves
the
rest
were
drowned
the
lot
of
these
exiles
as
of
the
carib
women
themselves
was
hard
enough
the
nation
was
low
and
barbarous
and
its
women
were
treated
accordingly
the
men
regarding
them
as
an
inferior
race
whose
degradation
was
only
natural
a
wife
was
her
husband
slave
and
all
the
drudgery
of
life
fell
upon
her
she
approached
him
with
abject
humility
and
if
she
ever
complained
of
it
was
at
the
risk
of
her
life
her
children
however
were
loved
and
watched
with
tender
care
the
original
inhabitants
of
the
west
indian
islands
have
disappeared
and
are
succeeded
by
a
mixture
of
races
of
whom
the
negroes
claim
our
attention
now
among
the
blacks
of
antigua
as
an
example
immorality
is
characteristic
infanticide
is
frequently
practiced
even
since
the
emancipation
bill
was
passed
the
reason
for
this
is
clear
under
slavery
negroes
could
not
contract
a
legal
marriage
they
therefore
cohabited
and
the
union
lasted
as
long
as
their
affection
or
appetite
existed
no
disgrace
attached
to
a
woman
who
had
borne
children
to
several
men
now
an
idea
of
female
virtue
has
been
awakened
and
they
seek
to
escape
the
consequences
of
an
illicit
amour
by
destroying
its
offspring
upon
the
principle
that
where
no
tangible
evidence
of
a
crime
exists
no
crime
has
been
committed
during
slavery
concubinage
was
general
and
although
many
masters
offered
rewards
to
such
as
lived
faithfully
with
one
partner
the
vice
was
all
but
universal
and
a
permanent
engagement
between
a
man
and
woman
was
seldom
formed
two
females
frequently
lived
with
one
man
one
being
considered
his
wife
and
the
other
his
mistress
when
the
negroes
were
emancipated
in
many
were
anxious
to
be
legally
married
and
others
put
away
the
partners
of
their
compulsory
servitude
and
took
new
companions
bigamy
was
not
uncommon
then
nor
is
it
rare
now
many
devices
being
adopted
to
elude
the
stringent
laws
on
this
matter
concubinage
is
less
general
than
formerly
but
the
marriage
covenant
is
by
no
means
respected
nor
is
chastity
much
esteemed
in
lucia
sexual
intercourse
was
unrestrained
and
almost
promiscuous
and
the
negroes
of
the
island
are
even
to
this
day
averse
to
matrimony
and
inclined
to
concubinage
in
either
relation
they
are
equally
faithless
the
only
redeeming
feature
being
love
of
their
children
the
same
low
state
of
morals
is
observable
in
santa
cruz
but
in
jamaica
the
negroes
are
mostly
married
and
faithful
to
their
engagements
formerly
the
intercourse
of
the
sexes
was
loose
profligate
and
lewd
when
the
missionaries
attempted
to
reform
this
any
who
submitted
to
their
teachings
were
ridiculed
by
the
demoralized
of
their
comrades
it
must
be
admitted
that
europeans
have
not
shown
any
good
example
to
the
negroes
but
on
the
contrary
have
encouraged
their
vices
java
a
curious
system
of
manners
now
prevails
in
java
hindoos
have
been
succeeded
by
mohammedans
and
they
in
turn
have
given
place
to
dutch
each
having
impressed
some
characteristic
on
the
people
as
elsewhere
the
condition
of
the
female
sex
will
indicate
the
general
character
the
institution
of
marriage
is
universally
known
if
not
practiced
or
respected
and
the
lot
of
women
may
be
considered
fortunate
they
are
not
in
any
manner
and
the
seclusion
imposed
upon
the
more
opulent
is
rather
a
withdrawal
from
the
indiscriminate
gaze
of
the
people
than
that
lonely
secrecy
exacted
by
jealousy
in
some
parts
of
the
east
the
condition
of
the
sex
in
java
is
an
exception
to
the
habits
of
asiatics
they
associate
with
the
men
in
all
the
pleasures
and
offices
of
life
eat
with
them
and
live
on
terms
of
mutual
equality
they
are
sometimes
permitted
to
ascend
the
throne
and
in
short
nowhere
throughout
the
island
are
they
treated
with
coarseness
violence
or
neglect
they
are
willing
and
industrious
and
are
admitted
to
many
honorable
employments
men
sometimes
act
tyrannically
in
their
households
but
this
only
shows
the
fault
of
an
individual
not
of
a
class
polygamy
and
concubinage
are
practiced
by
the
nobility
without
reference
to
public
opinion
but
are
not
generally
adopted
being
regarded
as
vicious
luxuries
the
first
wife
is
always
mistress
of
the
household
the
others
are
her
servants
who
may
minister
to
her
husband
pleasures
but
do
not
share
his
rank
or
wealth
no
man
will
give
his
daughter
as
second
or
third
wife
unless
to
some
one
far
superior
in
rank
to
himself
and
a
woman
considers
it
dishonorable
not
in
the
abstract
to
prostitute
herself
but
to
form
a
connection
with
any
man
of
humbler
birth
than
herself
but
though
polygamy
and
concubinage
are
seldom
known
in
java
their
absence
must
not
be
considered
as
implying
superior
morality
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
most
immoral
country
in
asia
a
woman
who
would
not
condescend
to
be
the
second
wife
of
a
chief
would
not
scruple
to
commit
adultery
with
him
in
general
terms
both
sexes
are
profligate
and
depraved
although
the
islanders
boast
the
chastity
of
their
women
as
a
distinguishing
ornament
because
a
married
woman
would
shriek
if
a
stranger
attempted
to
kiss
her
before
her
attendants
divorce
can
be
procured
in
java
with
the
utmost
freedom
and
is
a
privilege
in
which
the
women
indulge
themselves
to
a
wanton
degree
if
a
wife
pays
her
husband
a
sum
of
money
he
must
leave
her
he
is
not
legally
bound
to
accept
her
offer
but
public
opinion
considers
it
disreputable
to
live
with
a
woman
who
has
thus
signified
her
wishes
for
a
separation
and
he
yields
to
general
sentiment
what
is
not
exacted
by
law
the
husband
is
often
changed
three
or
four
times
before
the
woman
is
thirty
years
old
and
some
boast
the
exercise
of
this
privilege
twelve
times
as
the
means
of
subsistence
abound
and
are
procured
as
easily
by
women
as
by
men
the
former
are
independent
of
the
latter
and
find
no
difficulty
in
living
without
husbands
unfortunately
for
the
theories
of
some
female
reformers
of
the
present
day
who
imagine
that
such
independence
foreshadows
the
millennium
of
woman
rights
it
must
be
admitted
that
where
the
experiment
has
been
tried
the
sex
are
proverbially
dissolute
among
the
wealthier
classes
the
utmost
immorality
prevails
and
in
the
great
towns
the
population
is
debauched
to
the
last
degree
intrigues
with
married
women
continually
occur
and
are
prosecuted
almost
before
the
face
of
the
husbands
who
are
often
so
tame
and
servile
that
they
dare
not
assert
their
conjugal
rights
travelers
have
noticed
flagrant
instances
of
the
looseness
of
japanese
manners
but
one
case
will
suffice
one
of
the
princes
who
had
seduced
a
married
woman
and
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
her
at
times
when
her
husband
an
officer
in
the
public
guard
was
on
duty
was
surprised
in
her
company
on
one
occasion
the
chief
having
returned
home
earlier
than
was
expected
he
knew
the
rank
of
his
visitor
and
discreetly
coughed
so
that
the
prince
had
time
to
escape
he
then
went
to
the
chamber
and
flogged
his
wife
she
complained
to
the
prince
who
was
particularly
desirous
at
that
time
to
conciliate
his
subjects
he
sent
for
the
husband
made
him
many
rich
presents
and
allowed
him
to
select
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
royal
household
in
place
of
the
frail
one
who
had
betrayed
him
the
husband
accepted
the
allowed
his
wife
to
return
home
with
him
and
all
the
parties
were
satisfied
in
java
women
are
usually
married
very
young
as
their
chastity
is
in
danger
as
soon
as
they
reach
maturity
at
eighteen
or
twenty
a
girl
is
considered
to
be
getting
old
and
scarcely
any
are
unmarried
after
yet
age
does
not
exclude
a
woman
from
the
probabilities
of
matrimony
for
widows
often
procure
husbands
at
fifty
the
preliminary
arrangements
are
made
by
the
parents
as
scandal
would
not
allow
the
young
people
to
take
any
part
in
a
transaction
in
which
they
are
looked
upon
as
the
natives
express
it
as
mere
puppets
the
father
of
the
youth
having
made
a
suitable
choice
proposes
to
the
parents
of
the
girl
if
they
are
willing
the
betrothal
is
ratified
by
some
trifling
present
and
visits
are
made
that
the
intended
nuptials
may
be
publicly
known
subsequently
the
price
of
the
lady
is
arranged
varying
according
to
the
rank
and
circumstances
of
the
family
sometimes
this
is
plainly
called
the
and
sometimes
by
a
more
delicate
term
the
deposit
it
is
considered
as
a
settlement
for
the
bride
the
only
religious
feature
in
the
marriage
ceremony
is
an
exchange
of
vows
in
the
mosque
this
is
followed
by
many
observances
of
etiquette
and
parade
finally
the
married
couple
eat
from
the
same
vessel
to
testify
their
common
fortune
or

bride
washes
her
husband
feet
in
token
of
subjection
the
javanese
support
a
large
class
of
women
as
public
dancers
the
inhabitants
are
passionately
fond
of
this
amusement
but
no
respectable
woman
will
join
in
it
and
all
its
female
partisans
are
prostitutes
in
fact
the
words
and
are
synonymous
in
their
language
a
chief
of
high
rank
is
not
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
one
of
these
women
who
figure
at
most
large
entertainments
and
frequently
amass
enough
money
to
induce
some
petty
chief
to
marry
them
so
strong
however
is
their
ruling
passion
they
soon
ascertain
that
domesticity
is
not
their
sphere
and
become
tired
of
their
husbands
whom
they
divorce
without
ceremony
and
coolly
return
to
their
public
life
the
dress
in
which
they
perform
is
very
immodest
but
they
seldom
descend
to
such
obscene
and
degrading
postures
as
may
be
witnessed
in
other
eastern
countries
european
example
has
not
done
much
for
java
the
dutch
merchant
has
usually
a
native
female
called
his
housekeeper
in
every
city
public
prostitutes
abound
while
about
the
roads
in
the
vicinity
may
be
found
others
ready
for
hire
their
disguise
as
dancers
is
thought
to
conceal
their
profligacy
sumatra
the
population
of
this
island
is
divided
into
several
tribes
slightly
differing
in
their
manners
the
rejangs
who
may
be
supposed
to
represent
its
original
inhabitants
are
rude
barbarians
scrupulously
attentive
to
the
show
but
wanting
the
spirit
of
delicacy
they
drape
their
women
from
head
to
foot
dread
lest
a
virgin
should
expose
any
part
of
her
person
and
yet
modesty
is
not
a
characteristic
of
the
people
in
towns
and
villages
those
in
rural
districts
who
are
not
so
rigid
as
to
costume
are
more
distinguished
by
decency
the
customs
of
sumatra
are
of
a
peculiar
character
great
importance
being
attached
to
required
formulas
and
the
ritual
is
more
essential
than
the
principle
it
is
curious
to
examine
the
intricate
details
of
a
sumatran
marriage
contract
which
appears
to
be
so
little
understood
even
by
the
people
themselves
that
we
are
informed
one
of
these
documents
is
sufficient
to
originate
an
almost
endless
litigation
there
are
several
modes
of
forming
a
marriage
contract
the
first
is
when
one
man
agrees
to
pay
another
a
certain
sum
in
exchange
for
his
daughter
a
portion
of
the
amount
say
about
five
dollars
is
generally
held
back
to
keep
the
transaction
open
and
allow
the
girl
parents
a
chance
to
complain
if
she
is
ill
used
if
the
husband
wound
her
he
is
liable
to
a
fine
and
in
many
ways
his
authority
is
controlled
but
if
he
insists
on
paying
the
balance
of
the
her
parents
must
accept
it
and
then
their
right
of
interference
ceases
if
a
father
desires
to
get
rid
of
a
girl
suffering
from
any
infirmity
he
sells
her
without
this
reservation
and
she
has
fewer
privileges
in
consequence
in
other
cases
marriage
is
an
affair
of
barter
one
virgin
being
given
for
another
a
man
having
a
son
and
a
daughter
will
give
the
latter
in
exchange
for
a
wife
for
the
former
or
a
brother
will
dispose
of
his
sister
in
the
same
way
sometimes
a
girl
evades
these
customs
by
eloping
with
a
lover
of
her
own
choice
if
the
fugitives
are
overtaken
on
the
road
they
can
be
separated
but
if
they
have
taken
refuge
in
any
house
and
the
man
declares
his
willingness
to
obey
existing
rules
his
wife
is
secured
to
him
the
jewish
custom
of
a
man
marrying
his
brother
widow
is
in
force
among
the
sumatrans
and
if
there
be
no
brother
she
must
be
taken
by
the
nearest
male
relative
the
father
excepted
who
is
made
responsible
for
any
balance
of
her
which
may
be
due
adultery
is
not
frequently
committed
under
this
system
but
when
it
is
the
husband
chastises
his
wife
himself
or
else
forgives
the
offense
if
he
desire
to
divorce
her
he
may
claim
back
the
less
dollars
which
is
allowed
her
parents
for
depreciation
in
the
woman
value
if
a
man
who
has
taken
a
wife
is
unable
to
pay
the
whole
price
her
friends
may
sue
for
a
divorce
but
then
they
must
return
all
they
have
received
from
him
the
ceremony
of
divorce
consists
in
cutting
a
ratan
in
two
in
presence
of
the
parties
and
their
witnesses
another
kind
of
marriage
is
when
a
girl
father
selects
some
man
whom
he
adopts
into
his
family
receiving
a
premium
of
about
twenty
dollars
the
family
thus
acquire
a
property
in
the
young
husband
they
are
answerable
for
his
debts
claim
all
he
earns
and
have
the
privilege
of
turning
him
out
of
doors
when
they
are
tired
of
him
the
malays
of
sumalda
have
generally
adopted
a
third
kind
of
marriage
which
they
call
in
this
the
families
approach
each
other
on
an
equal
level
a
small
sum
about
twelve
dollars
is
paid
to
the
parents
and
an
agreement
is
made
that
all
property
shall
be
common
between
husband
and
wife
and
if
a
divorce
takes
place
it
shall
be
fairly
divided
the
actual
ceremony
of
marriage
is
simple
a
feast
is
given
the
couple
join
their
hands
and
some
one
pronounces
them
man
and
wife
where
the
female
is
an
article
of
sale
little
of
what
we
call
courtship
can
be
expected
it
is
opposed
to
the
manners
of
the
country
which
impose
strict
separation
of
the
sexes
in
youth
and
besides
when
a
man
pays
the
price
of
his
wife
he
considers
he
is
entitled
to
possession
without
any
question
as
to
her
predilections
but
traces
of
courtship
may
be
met
with
on
the
very
few
occasions
when
young
people
are
allowed
to
meet
such
as
public
festivals
a
degree
of
respect
is
shown
to
women
contrasting
very
favorably
with
the
observances
of
more
civilized
communities
and
mutual
attachments
sometimes
spring
from
these
associations
the
festivals
are
enlivened
by
dances
and
songs
the
former
have
been
described
as
licentious
but
an
english
traveler
says
he
has
often
seen
more
immodest
displays
in
a
in
his
native
country
the
songs
are
extempore
and
love
is
the
constant
theme
polygamy
is
permitted
but
only
a
few
chiefs
have
more
than
one
wife
to
be
a
second
one
is
considered
far
below
the
dignity
of
a
respectable
woman
and
a
man
would
demand
a
divorce
for
his
daughter
if
her
husband
was
about
to
take
an
additional
companion
marsden
the
traveler
already
mentioned
says
that
in
the
country
parts
of
sumatra
chastity
is
general
but
the
merit
is
lost
when
he
adds
that
interest
causes
the
parents
to
be
watchful
of
their
daughters
because
the
selling
price
of
a
virgin
is
far
above
that
of
a
woman
who
has
been
defiled
if
a
case
of
seduction
occurs
the
seducer
can
be
forced
to
marry
the
girl
and
pay
her
original
price
or
else
give
her
parents
the
sum
which
they
would
lose
by
her
error
regular
prostitution
is
rare
in
the
bazars
of
the
towns
some
women
of
this
class
may
be
found
and
in
the
profligacy
abounds
troops
of
professional
courtesans
parading
the
streets
no
one
would
estimate
the
morality
of
a
country
from
the
spectacles
exhibited
in
maritime
cities
as
a
general
rule
the
sumatran
is
content
to
marry
and
is
faithful
to
his
wife
this
may
proceed
from
temperament
rather
than
morality
as
their
ideas
on
the
latter
are
not
very
rigid
this
is
shown
by
their
opinion
of
incest
which
they
regard
as
an
infraction
of
conventional
law
sometimes
punishing
it
by
a
fine
and
at
other
times
confirming
the
marriage
unless
it
occurs
within
the
first
degree
of
relationship
borneo
notwithstanding
the
attention
which
has
been
drawn
to
the
island
of
borneo
within
the
last
few
years
it
is
yet
but
little
known
to
the
general
reader
the
investigations
of
sir
james
brooke
and
others
have
enabled
us
to
discern
many
of
its
social
features
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
borneo
are
in
a
state
of
barbarism
some
wander
naked
in
the
forest
and
subsist
on
the
spontaneous
productions
of
the
earth
others
cultivate
the
soil
dwell
in
villages
and
trade
with
their
neighbors
the

communities
are
more
advanced
than
those
who
live
inland
and
the
inhabitants
of
are
more
educated
and
more
profligate
than
any
these
have
been
farther
debased
by
the
abominable
system
of
piracy
which
until
recently
was
their
occupation
among
the
sea
dyaks
or
dwellers
on
the
coast
there
is
no
social
law
to
govern
sexual
intercourse
before
marriage
nor
is
the
authority
of
parents
recognized
in
the
matter
the
dyak
girl
selects
a
husband
for
herself
and
while
she
remains
single
incurs
no
disgrace
by
cohabiting
with
as
many
as
she
pleases
after
marriage
she
is
subject
to
more
stringent
rules
for
as
a
man
is
allowed
only
one
wife
he
requires
her
to
be
faithful
or
in
default
punishes
her
with
a
severe
whipping
if
he
is
incontinent
he
incurs
a
similar
penalty
cases
of
adultery
are
not
frequent
though
they
sometimes
occur
in
time
of
war
the
ceremony
of
marriage
is
as
simple
as
possible
the
consent
of
the
woman
is
first
obtained
then
the
bride
and
bridegroom
meet
and
give
a
feast
which
completes
the
contract
if
a
girl
becomes
pregnant
the
father
of
the
child
must
marry
her
and
this
is
a
common
way
of
securing
a
husband
a
man
and
woman
live
together
for
a
time
and
separate
if
there
is
no
prospect
of
a
family
during
this
probation
constancy
is
not
considered
indispensable
the
fear
of
not
becoming
the
father
of
a
family
a
misfortune
greatly
dreaded
by
the
dyaks
favors
the
loose
intercourse
of
unmarried
people

some
tribes

duties
of
hospitality

he
shall
be
furnished
with
a
female
companion
at
every
place
where
he
sleeps
among
the

early

unknown
polygamy

ever

that
act

they

the

to
this
is
ascribed
the

common

a
conclusion
warranted
to
some
extent
by
the
imbecile
state
of

families
condemned
to
perpetual
intermarriages
it
is
said
that
many
prostitutes
may
be
found
among
the
people
of
the
south
but
this
rests
on
doubtful
testimony
and
in
the
dyak
language
there
is
no
word
to
express
the
vice
the
sibnouan
females
are
neither
concealed
from

before

they

the

they
are
not
so
degraded
as
in
other
barbarous

they
eat

take
part
in

there
is

more

their

an
english
physician
lately
received
a
message
from
the
wife
of
a
chief
appointing
a
secret
meeting
he
was
punctual
to
the
assignation
and
met
the
lady
who
asked
him
for
a
close
of
arsenic
to
poison
her
husband
as
he
her
report
says
that
the
englishman
was
disappointed
in
the
nature
of
the
interview
but
firmly
refused
to
grant
her
request
the
rich
malays
allow
their
wives
to
keep
female
slaves
and
the
jealousy
of
the
mistress
renders
their
situation
any
thing
but
pleasant
they
sometimes
serve
as
concubines
in
which
case
the
law
renders
them
free
but
many
refuse
to
avail
themselves
of
this
advantage
we
have
no
definite
account
of
prostitutes
in
towns
but
they
appear
to
be
of
several
classes
those
who
cohabit
temporarily
with
the
malays
those
who
prostitute
themselves
indiscriminately
to
all
comers
and
those
who
are
supported
by
sailors
and
profligate
chinese
who
invariably
create
such
a
class
wherever
they
settle
it
is
certain
that
women
of
this
class
exist
in
considerable
numbers

women
occupy
an
inferior
position
in
persia
where
they
are
literally
the
property
of
men
the
lower
classes
consider
them
valuable
for
their
labor
the
rich
regard
them
as
instruments
of
pleasure
while
persian
poetry
and
romance
are
devoted
to
the
praise
of
female
charms
the
realities
of
life
prove
that
the
sex
is
held
in
slight
esteem
the
wives
of
the
shah
vegetate
within
the
walls
of
a
luxurious
prison
and
if
one
is
ever
permitted
to
breathe
the
air
outside
she
is
paraded
in
solemn
procession
guarded
by
a
troup
of
eunuchs
armed
with
loaded
muskets
in
order
to
drive
off
any
curious
wayfarer
who
might
be
tempted
to
gaze
on
the
charms
of
a
royal
mistress
nor
is
this
isolation
peculiar
to
them
it
pervades
all
the
upper
classes
and
brothers
are
not
allowed
to
see
their
sisters
after
a
certain
age
this
jealousy
is
not
decreased
by
the
polygamy
which
is
common
in
the
country
the
religious
laws
limit
a
persian
to
four
wives
but
allow
him
to
keep
as
many
concubines
as
he
can
afford
and
in
pursuance
of
this
privilege
the
harem
of
the
palace
is
said
to
contain
at
times
more
than
a
thousand
women
who
need
a
stringent
discipline
to
keep
them
in
order
they
are
arranged
with
a
strict
regard
to
precedence
the
chief
favorite
lives
in
splendor
her
attire
is
covered
with
costly
jewels
and
she
has
the
privilege
of
sitting
in
the
royal
presence
her
inferiors
are
subject
to
much
rigor
and
the
eunuchs
preserve
decorum
by
administering
personal
chastisement
with
the
heel
of
a
slipper
on
the
face
of
a
refractory
woman
they
seem
insensible
to
any
degradation
many
of
them
lead
a
pleasant
idle
life
lounging
for
hours
in
the
warm
bath
and
emerging
with
enervated
frames
to
deck
their
pretty
persons
in
order
to
render
themselves
attractive
to
the
shah
they
court
his
favor
as
much
as
they
fear
his
frown
and
with
good
reason
the
former
can
raise
them
to
the
summit
of
their
ambition
the
latter
can
condemn
them
to
be
fastened
in
a
sack
and
thrown
from
a
lofty
tower
common
usage
permits
a
persian
to
take
a
woman
in
three
different
ways
he
may
marry
purchase
or
hire
her
in
the
first
case
betrothal
sometimes
takes
place
in
infancy
but
it
must
be
subsequently
confirmed
by
the
parties
in
this
they
seldom
fail
for
if
a
girl
shows
any
repugnance
to
ratify
her
father
contract
he
whips
her
until
she
consents
and
she
requires
little
of
this
kind
of
argument
to
induce
compliance
the
nuptial
ceremony
must
be
witnessed
by
two
persons
one
of
whom
is
a
legal
officer
to
attest
the
contract
this
is
delivered
to
the
bride
and
by
her
carefully
preserved
as
it
proves
her
title
to
provision
in
the
event
of
widowhood
or
divorce
though
a
man
has
the
right
to
put
away
his
wife
when
he
pleases
the
attendant
expense
and
scandal
render
it
a
rare
proceeding
mohammedan
jealousy
farther
protects
the
woman
as
no
one
will
willingly
allow
a
female
with
whom
he
has
lived
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
another
in
addition
to
this
interest
restrains
a
husband
from
using
his
privileges
in
a
direct
manner
as
when
he
takes
the
initiative
he
must
pay
back
the
dowry
he
received
with
his
wife
if
she
applies
for
divorce
he
is
free
from
this
obligation
the
advantage
being
thus
on
the
side
a
species
of
tyranny
is
frequently
practiced
until
the
woman
is
forced
to
open
the
suit
when
he
gets
rid
of
her
but
retains
her
property
a
persian
may
purchase
as
many
female
slaves
as
he
desires
these
acquire
no
advantage
of
position
by
being
his
concubines
he
may
sell
or
otherwise
dispose
of
them
at
any
moment
he
thinks
proper
the
custom
of
hiring
wives
still
prevails
in
persia
though
strict
mohammedans
abhor
and
condemn
the
practice
which
was
prohibited
by
omar
the
successor
of
mohammed
in
operation
it
is
an
agreement
made
by
a
man
and
woman
to
cohabit
a
specified
time
for
an
agreed
sum
of
money
the
children
springing
from
this
union
must
be
supported
by
the
father
if
the
man
terminate
the
connection
prematurely
he
must
still
pay
the
whole
stipulated
amount
and
the
woman
is
restrained
from
accepting
any
other
protector
until
a
sufficient
time
has
elapsed
to
prove
whether
she
is
pregnant
by
the
former
although
these
contracts
are
ranked
as
marriages
few
readers
will
be
inclined
to
think
them
any
thing
but
systematic
prostitution
formerly
there
were
numerous
open
and
avowed
prostitutes
in
persia
among
whom
the
dancing
girls
were
conspicuous
for
the
beauty
of
their
persons
and
the
melody
of
their
voices
they
had
considerable
sway
until
the
time
of
futteh
ali
khan
who
crowded
his
palace
with
concubines
and
from
among
them
issued
edicts
to
suppress
immorality
prohibiting
the
dancing
girls
from
approaching
the
court
and
exiling
them
to
the
distant
provinces
social
life
was
most
depraved
under
the
sefi
dynasty
public
brothels
were
very
numerous
and
largely
contributed
to
the
national
revenue
no
less
than
thirty
thousand
prostitutes
paying
an
annual
tax
in
ispahan
alone
the
governors
of
provinces
allowed
similar
privileges
for
money
and
there
was
scarcely
a
town
which
had
not
one
licensed
brothel
at
least
whose
inmates
also
licensed
and
taxed
were
known
as
or
the
worthless
as
soon
as
the
shops
were
closed
these
houses
were
opened
and
the
women
repaired
to
particular
localities
where
they
sat
in
rows
closely
veiled
with
each
company
was
an
old
harridan
whose
business
was
to
show
the
faces
of
her
troop
to
any
man
desiring
a
companion
and
to
receive
his
payment
when
the
selection
was
made
under
the
reigning
family
this
system
has
been
checked
no
licenses
are
now
given
and
prostitution
has
retired
to
secrecy
but
the
vice
has
in
no
way
decreased
and
public
brothels
abound
in
all
the
cities
of
persia
afghanistan
marriage
in
afghanistan
is
a
commercial
transaction
the
women
being
sold
for
prices
varying
according
to
circumstances
this
system
is
carried
to
such
an
extent
that
if
a
widow
marries
the
friends
of
her
first
husband
can
recover
from
his
successor
the
amount
originally
paid
for
her
the
necessity
of
purchasing
a
wife
renders
many
of
the
poorer
classes
unable
to
marry
until
well
advanced
in
years
in
opposition
to
the
custom
of
their
wealthy
neighbors
among
whom
bridegrooms
of
fifteen
and
brides
of
twelve
years
old
are
common
the
prior
intercourse
of
the
sexes
is
regulated
by
various
circumstances
in
crowded
towns
men
have
little
opportunity
of
associating
with
women
and
there
professional
exist
their
functions
are
in
the
first
place
to
see
and
report
upon
any
girl
whom
a
man
may
wish
to
marry
then
to
ascertain
if
her
family
would
agree
to
the
match
and
finally
to
make
arrangements
for
a
public
proposal
this
is
made
by
the
father
in
company
with
a
number
of
male
friends
to
the
father
of
the
girl
while
a
similar
deputation
of
females
waits
upon
the
mother
presents
are
made
the
selling
price
determined
and
the
couple
are
betrothed
soon
after
the
parties
sign
a
mutual
contract
stipulation
is
made
for
provision
for
the
woman
if
divorced
a
festival
is
given
the
bridegroom
pays
for
his
wife
and
she
is
delivered
at
the
dwelling
of
her
future
master
similar
formalities
take
place
in
the
country
but
as
the
social
intercourse
is
less
restricted
there
marriages
frequently
spring
from
attachment
and
the
negotiations
are
mere
matters
of
etiquette
a
romantic
lover
may
obtain
his
mistress
without
the
consent
of
her
parents
by
tearing
away
her
veil
cutting
off
a
lock
of
her
hair
or
throwing
a
large
white
cloth
over
her
and
declaring
her
his
affianced
bride
these
proceedings
do
not
release
him
from
the
obligation
to
pay
for
her
which
is
only
evaded
by
an
elopement
a
serious
step
considered
by
the
girl
family
as
equivalent
to
murder
and
revenged
accordingly
unless
the
couple
secure
shelter
and
protection
from
some
neighboring
tribe
sometimes
a
man
never
sees
his
bride
until
the
marriage
is
completed
in
certain
districts
where
this
rule
nominally
exists
it
is
practically
violated
secret
interviews
between
the
bride
and
bridegroom
being
tolerated
and
called
the
sport
of
the
betrothed
the
young
man
steals
after
dark
to
the
house
of
his
charmer
affecting
to
conceal
his
presence
from
the
men
and
is
introduced
by
the
mother
to
her
room
where
the
couple
are
left
till
the
morning
undisturbed
the
ordinary
result
of
this
is
the
anticipation
of
nuptial
privileges
and
cases
have
been
known
where
the
bride
has
borne
several
children
before
she
has
been
formally
delivered
to
her
husband
polygamy
is
allowed
but
is
too
expensive
to
be
practiced
by
the
majority
of
the
people
although
some
rich
men
maintain
a
large
number
of
concubines
in
addition
to
the
four
legal
wives
the
social
condition
of
females
is
low
in
afghanistan
among
the
more
barbarous
tribes
they
labor
in
the
fields
with
the
poor
all
the
drudgery
of
the
house
falls
upon
them
while
the
rich
keep
them
secluded
in
the
harems
the
law
allows
a
man
the
privilege
of
beating
his
wife
but
custom
is
more
chivalrous
than
the
code
and
considers
such
an
act
disgraceful
of
avowed
prostitutes
in
this
region
we
know
but
little
beyond
the
bare
fact
that
such
a
class
exists
and
that
their
profligacy
is
materially
aided
by
the
ignorance
and
insipidity
of
the
wives
and
concubines
when
contrasted
with
the
knowledge
of
the
world
and
comparatively
polished
manners
exhibited
by
courtesans
whose
society
is
frequently
sought
as
a
relief
from
the
monotony
of
home
kashmir
unoppressed
by
any
rigid
code
of
etiquette
and
naturally
addicted
to
pleasure
the
people
of
kashmir
find
much
of
their
enjoyment
in
female
society
and
from
the
earliest
times
have
been
noted
for
their
love
of
singers
and
dancers
in
former
days
the
capital
city
was
the
scene
of
constant
revels
in
which
morality
was
but
a
secondary
consideration
and
now
the
inhabitants
relieve
the
continual
struggle
against
misfortune
and
despotism
by
indulging
in
gross
vices
and
drown
the
sense
of
hopeless
poverty
in
the
gratification
of
animal
passions
the
women
of
this
delightful
valley
have
long
been
celebrated
for
their
beauty
and
are
still
called
the
flower
of
the
oriental
race
the
face
is
of
a
dark
complexion
richly
flushed
with
pink
the
eyes
large
and
overflowing
with
a
peculiar
liquid
brilliance
the
features
regular
harmonious
and
fine
the
limbs
and
bodies
are
models
of
grace
but
all
writers
agree
that
art
does
nothing
to
aid
nature
and
it
is
not
unusual
to
see
eyes
unsurpassed
for
brightness
and
expression
flashing
from
a
very
dirty
face
among
the
poorer
classes
filth
and
degradation
render
many
women
actually
repulsive
notwithstanding
their
resplendent
beauty
travelers
always
remark
the
dancing
girls
who
have
acquired
so
much
renown
in
kashmir
the
village
of
changus
was
at
one
time
celebrated
for
a
colony
of
these
women
who
excelled
all
others
in
the
valley
but
now
its
famous
beauties
have
disappeared
and
live
only
in
the
traditions
of
the
place
the
dancing
girls
may
be
divided
into
several
classes
among
the
higher
may
be
found
those
who
are
virtuous
and
modest
probably
to
about
the
same
extent
as
among
actresses
opera
singers
and
ballet
girls
in
civilized
communities
others
frequent
entertainments
at
the
houses
of
rich
men
or
public
festivals
and
estimate
their
favors
at
a
very
high
price
while
the
remainder
are
avowed
harlots
prostituting
themselves
indiscriminately
to
any
who
desire
their
company
many
of
these
are
devoted
to
the
service
of
some
god
whose
temple
is
enriched
from
the
gains
of
their
calling
the
watul
or
gipsy
tribe
of
kashmir
is
remarkable
for
many
lovely
women
who
are
taught
to
please
the
taste
of
the
voluptuary
they
sing
licentious
songs
in
an
amorous
tone
dance
in
a
lascivious
measure
dress
in
a
peculiarly
fascinating
manner
and
seduce
by
the
very
expression
of
their
countenances
when
they
join
a
company
of
dancing
girls
they
are
uniformly
successful
in
their
vocation
and
have
been
known
to
amass
large
sums
of
money
now
that
the
valley
is
in
its
decadence
their
charms
find
a
more
profitable
market
in
other
places
the
bands
of
dancing
girls
are
usually
accompanied
by
sundry
hideous
duennas
whose
conspicuous
ugliness
forms
a
striking
contrast
to
their
charge
the
nach
girls
are
under
the
surveillance
of
the
government
which
licenses
their
prostitution
they
are
actual
slaves
and
can
not
sing
or
dance
without
permission
from
their
overseer
to
whom
they
must
resign
a
large
portion
of
their
earnings
in
addition
to
these
who
may
be
styled
poetical
courtesans
there
exists
a
swarm
of
prostitutes
frequenting
low
houses
in
the
cities
or
boats
on
the
lake
but
of
them
we
have
no
distinct
account
it
is
certain
that
they
are
largely
visited
by
the
more
immoral
of
the
population
and
an
accurate
idea
of
their
may
be
formed
from
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
traveler
moorcraft
who
gave
gratuitous
medical
advice
to
the
poor
of
serinaghur
had
at
one
time
nearly
seven
thousand
patients
on
his
lists
a
very
large
number
of
whom
were
suffering
from
loathsome
diseases
induced
by
the
grossest
and
most
persevering
profligacy
in
short
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
that
the
manners
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
interesting
and
beautiful
valley
are
corrupt
to
the
last
degree
india
india
exhibits
in
its
different
communities
many
aspects
of
social
life
but
it
may
be
said
in
general
terms
that
the
state
of
woman
is
degraded
as
she
is
absolutely
dependent
upon
man
and
can
do
nothing
of
her

with
reverence
is
bound
to
him
so
long
as
he
desires
it
whatever
his
conduct
may
be
and
if
she
rebel
is
liable
to
be
chastised
with
a
rope
or
a
cane
in
a
cruel
manner
debarred
the
advantages
of
education
not
allowed
to
eat
with
their
husbands
or
to
mix
in
society
women
are
yet
not
treated
as
abject
slaves
and
from
the
few
revelations
of
the
zenana
which
have
been
made
it
may
be
inferred
that
its
inmates
receive
considerable
deference
and
attention
polygamy
is
permitted
in
india
but
not
encouraged
by
the
religious
law
and
only
sanctioned
in
certain
cases
such
as
barrenness
inconstancy
or
some
similar
cause
and
then
the
wife
consent
must
be
obtained
before
a
second
and
subordinate
wife
can
be
added
to
the
household
marriage
is
viewed
as
a
religious
duty
by
the
hindoos
only
a
few
being
exempt
from
the
obligation
it
is
forbidden
to
purchase
a
wife
for
money
but
the
girls
have
little
choice
as
to
their
destiny
being
usually
betrothed
while
young
a
father
has
the
right
to
dispose
of
his
daughter
until
three
years
after
the
age
of
puberty
when
she
may
choose
a
husband
for
herself
not
many
remain
single
till
that
time
as
celibacy
would
be
accounted
disgraceful
and
few
men
would
marry
a
maiden
so
old
in
bengal
betrothal
takes
place
with
many
rites
and
much
ostentation
the
is
taken
to
her
future
husband
house
and
remains
there
a
short
time
when
she
returns
to
her
parents
until
mature
the
anxiety
to
dispose
of
a
daughter
as
young
as
possible
arises
from
the
fact
that
her
birth
is
regarded
as
inauspicious
and
even
as
a
domestic
calamity
from
which
her
parents
are
glad
to
escape
hence
the
character
of
the
bridegroom
is
a
secondary
consideration
and
marriage
often
results
unhappily
in
fact
little
else
can
be
expected
where
the
parties
are
absolutely
strangers
to
each
other
until
the
union
is
effected
the
uneducated
wife
without
a
gleam
of
knowledge
amuses
herself
by
a
thousand
trivial
devices
such
as
adorning
her
person
curling
her
hair
or
listening
to
the
gossip
of
her
slaves
it
is
nevertheless
generally
admitted
that
the
majority
of
hindoo
women
are
faithful
to
their
marital
vows
the
severe
laws
against
unchastity
are
framed
more
for
preserving
than
morals
and
severely
punish
any
woman
detected
in
an
intrigue
with
a
man
of
different
grade
to
herself
divorce
may
be
easily
effected
by
the
husband
but
the
wife
has
no
corresponding
power
a
man
who
calls
his
wife
mother
renounces
her
by
that
act
a
barren
wife
may
be
superseded
in
the
eighth
year
she
who
bears
only
daughters
or
whose
children
die
in
the
birth
in
the
eleventh
year
and
one
of
an
unkind
disposition
may
be
divorced
without
any
delay
the
customs
that
prevail
in
different
provinces
respecting
wives
and
their
treatment
may
be
described
in
a
few
words
in
arracan
when
a
man
wants
money
he
pawns
his
wife
for
a
certain
sum
or
else
sells
her
altogether
in
the
southern
parts
of
the
peninsula
polygamy
is
largely
practiced
the
shaynagas
of
canara
are
not
allowed
to
take
a
second
wife
unless
the
first
be
childless
the
corannas
the
panchalura
and
other
tribes
permitted
polygamy
and
the
purchase
of
wives
among
the
woddas
every
man
had
as
many
wives
as
he
pleased
all
worked
for
him
and
a
lazy
one
was
divorced
the
carruburru
took
no
notice
of
an
act
of
adultery
if
the
wife
was
a
woman
otherwise
she
might
live
with
any
man
who
chose
to
keep
her
in
rajpootana
woman
holds
a
higher
position
and
exercises
considerable
influence
on
the
actions
and
tastes
of
men
for
a
rajpoot
consults
his
wife
on
every
important
occasion
the
estimation
in
which
they
are
held
is
indicated
by
a
national
proverb
which
says
when
wives
are
honored
the
gods
are
pleased
when
they
are
dishonored
the
gods
are
offended
this
district
exhibits
the
hindoo
women
in
the
most
favorable
circumstances
and
even
here
they
hold
but
a
subordinate
place
as
must
always
be
the
case
where
polygamy
is
tolerated
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
review
all
the
local
peculiarities
of
so
extended
a
people
enough
has
been
said
to
show
the
social
condition
of
married
women
it
remains
to
give
some
account
of
prostitution
some
of
the
dancing
women
and
musicians
of
southern
india
were
attached
to
every
temple
a
portion
were
reserved
by
the
sensual
brahmins
for
their
exclusive
pleasures
and
the
rest
hired
themselves
out
indiscriminately
each
troop
was
under
a
chief
who
regulated
their
performances
and
prices
in
the
temple
of
tulava
near
mangalore
a
curious
custom
existed
any
woman
could
dedicate
herself
to
prostitution
by
eating
some
of
the
rice
which
had
been
offered
to
the
idol
and
was
allowed
her
choice
to
live
within
or
without
its
precincts
in
the
former
case
she
received
a
daily
allowance
of
food
and
her
prostitution
was
limited
to
the
priests
in
the
latter
her
amours
were
unrestricted
but
a
stipulated
portion
of
her
profits
must
be
given
to
the
temple
in
sindh
every
town
has
a
troop
of
dancing
girls
many
of
whom
are
very
handsome
before
the
british
conquest
the
vice
was
largely
encouraged
numbers
of
the
women
acquired
considerable
fortunes
and
their
political
influence
was
potent
in
the
of
the
debauched
amirs
an
evident
reform
has
taken
place
of
late
years
the
lascivious
scenes
of
the
southern
country
are
not
enacted
at
least
to
the
same
extent
in
hindostan
proper
where
the
interest
of
the
english
government
has
been
directed
against
immorality
toward
the
close
of
the
last
century
an
official
report
was
made
on
the
morals
of
british
india
it
was
bad
enough
much
laxity
prevailed
in
private
life
receptacles
for
women
of
bad
character
abounded
prostitutes
had
a
place
in
society
made
an
important
figure
at
great
entertainments
and
were
admitted
to
the
zenanas
to
exhibit
their
voluptuous
dances
contrasted
with
former
years
a
great
improvement
is
now
perceptible
and
the
profligacy
of
large
cities
scarcely
exceeds
the
vices
of
european
communities
thus
benares
with
a
population
of
had
prostitutes
and
decca
with
nearly
inhabitants
had
prostitutes
apart
from
governmental
influences
it
can
scarcely
be
denied
that
europeans
have
contributed
to
the
advance
of
vice
by
taking
temporary
companions
these
were
scarcely
considered
improper
the
custom
was
to
purchase
girls
from
their
mothers
many
of
them
were
faithful
and
attached
to
their
protectors
but
their
extravagance
and
propensity
for
gambling
made
them
very
costly
adjuncts
the
religious
ceremonies
originated
by
the
brahmins
were
often
but
scenes
of
the
wildest
debauchery
rivaling
the
ancient
egyptian
festival
of
bubastis
and
no
good
would
result
from
an
extended
description
of
dances
performed
by
nude
or
women
of
the
desecration
of
wives
by
a
licentious
priesthood
or
of
the
disgusting
polygamy
of
the
brahmins
suffice
it
to
say
that
such
customs
existed
but
are
now
yielding
to
more
refined
observances
the
general
profligacy
of
the
country
has
introduced
syphilis
in
most
parts
of
hindostan
some
assert
that
it
was
carried
there
after
the
discovery
of
america
but
neither
history
nor
tradition
warrants
this
opinion
it
may
be
noticed
that
it
is
not
called
by
any
sanscrit
word
but
is
known
by
a
persian
appellation
our
notice
of
india
would
be
incomplete
without
an
allusion
to
the
or
burning
of
widows
and
to
infanticide
the
shastres
are
full
of
recommendations
to
perform
the
first
of
these
shocking
observances
and
promise
ineffable
bliss
to
the
voluntary
victim
it
was
carried
to
such
an
extent
that
fifteen
thousand
women
are
reported
to
have
perished
in
one
year
in
bengal
this
is
doubtless
an
exaggeration
although
the
number
was
confessedly
very
large
among
the
horrible
details
of
the
practice
we
find
that
betrothed
children
of
eight
or
ten
years
old
and
women
of
have
alike
been
thrown
into
the
burning
pile
fearful
scenes
have
been
witnessed
on
these
occasions
a
miserable
wretch
has
twice
escaped
from
the
fire
and
clung
to
the
feet
of
a
traveler
vainly
imploring
him
to
save
her
and
then
naked
and
with
the
flesh
already
burned
from
parts
of
her
body
has
been
bound
and
thrown
into
the
flames
by
the
frantic
relatives
let
british
rule
in
india
be
what
it
may
no
man
no
aborigines
protection
society
can
regret
its
spread
in
conjunction
with
the
services
rendered
to
our
common
humanity
by
the
abolition
of
the
infanticide
formerly
prevailed
to
a
great
extent
but
is
now
almost
extirpated
from
british
india
the
crime
was
sanctioned
by
custom
but
not
by
religion
or
tradition
its
victims
were
chiefly
females
and
their
murder
was
in
consequence
of
the
difficulty
of
marrying
them
within
the
required
bounds
of
or
of
the
ruinous
expenses
which
fashion
required
should
be
incurred
at
the
wedding
ceremonies
rather
than
from
any
other
cause
it
appears
to
have
been
the
custom
among
the
ancient
dwellers
on
the
banks
of
the
indus
for
the
father
of
a
female
child
to
carry
it
to
the
and
publicly
demand
if
any
one
wanted
a
wife
if
the
reply
was
in
the
affirmative
it
was
betrothed
at
once
and
carefully
reared
but
otherwise
it
was
immediately
killed
wilkinson
asserted
years
ago
that
twenty
thousand
children
were
annually
murdered
in
malwa
and
rajpootana
but
by
the
system
of
rewarding
parents
who
reared
their
offspring
and
the
gradual
introduction
of
salutary
laws
a
mighty
reform
has
been
effected
ceylon
under
the
original
institutions
of
the
singhalese
they
never
licensed
public
prostitution
nor
made
brothels
of
the
temples
as
in
india
whatever
effect
the
buddhist
religion
produced
was
in
favor
of
virtue
but
the
character
of
the
people
is
naturally
sensual
profligacy
among
men
and
want
of
chastity
among
women
are
general
characteristics
and
even
those
who
profess
christianity
and
acknowledge
the
moral
law
of
england
are
not
free
from
this
stain
in
ceylon
as
indeed
in
most
parts
of
asia
marriage
is
contracted
at
an
early
age
a
man
attains
his
majority
at
sixteen
and
a
girl
as
soon
as
marriageable
by
nature
is
marriageable
by
law
at
which
time
her
parents
or
relatives
give
a
feast
inviting
a
number
of
single
men
soon
after
a
man
who
may
desire
to
marry
her
sends
one
of
his
friends
to
her
parents
to
mention
in
apparently
a
casual
manner
that
a
rumor
of
the
intended
marriage
of
his
friend
and
their
daughter
is
in
circulation
if
this
announcement
meets
a
favorable
reception
the
father
of
the
bridegroom
calls
inquires
the
amount
of
the
dowry
and
carries
the
negotiation
a
few
steps
farther
mutual
visits
are
then
exchanged
preliminaries
settled
and
an
auspicious
day
fixed
for
the
wedding
which
takes
place
with
much
ceremony
the
stars
are
consulted
in
every
step
and
should
the
bridegroom
horoscope
differ
from
the
bride
his
younger
brother
may
act
as
his
proxy
at
the
ceremony
the
whole
buddhaical
ritual
is
a
tedious
succession
of
formalities
entails
enormous
expenses
and
can
not
be
followed
by
the
poor
to
those
of
low
caste
it
is
positively
forbidden
even
if
they
are
rich
enough
to
meet
the
outlay
and
with
these
marriage
is
limited
to
a
simple
agreement
between
the
parents
of
the
young
couple
among
the
kandians
polyandrism
prevails
to
a
great
extent
a
matron
of
high
being
sometimes
the
wife
of
eight
brothers
the
people
justify
this
custom
upon
several
grounds
among
the
rich
because
it
prevents
litigation
saves
property
from
minute
subdivision
and
concentrates
family
influence
with
the
poor
because
it
reduces
expenses
and
frequently
where
one
brother
could
not
alone
maintain
a
wife
and
family
the
association
of
several
can
command
the
means
this
plurality
of
husbands
is
not
necessarily
confined
to
brothers
for
a
man
may
with
his
wife
consent
introduce
a
stranger
who
is
called
an
associated
husband
and
is
entitled
to
all
marital
rights
this
practice
does
not
extend
beyond
the
province
of
kandy
although
it
was
formerly
prevalent
throughout
the
maritime
districts
of
the
island
another
kandian
peculiarity
was
a
kind
of
marriage
called
bema
in
which
the
husband
lived
at
his
wife
house
he
received
but
little
respect
from
his
relations
and
could
be
ejected
at
once
if
unpopular
there
is
an
ancient
proverb
in
reference
to
this
dubious
arrangement
which
says
that
a
man
married
according
to
the
bema
process
should
only
take
to
his
bride
house
a
pair
of
sandals
to
protect
his
feet
a
palm
leaf
to
shield
his
head
a
staff
to
support
him
if
sick
and
a
lantern
in
case
he
should
be
expelled
in
the
dark
so
that
he
may
be
prepared
to
depart
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
in
ceylon
women
frequently
seek
for
divorces
for
the
most
trivial
causes
and
as
separation
can
be
attained
by
a
mere
return
of
the
marriage
gifts
it
often
takes
place
if
a
child
is
born
within
nine
months
from
this
separation
the
husband
is
required
to
support
it
for
three
years
if
a
married
woman
commits
adultery
and
the
husband
is
a
witness
he
may
kill
her
lover
when
a
man
puts
away
his
wife
on
account
of
an
intrigue
he
may
disinherit
her
and
the
whole
of
her
offspring
even
if
the
latter
were
born
before
any
crime
had
been
committed
by
their
mother
if
he
seeks
a
divorce
from
caprice
he
must
relinquish
all
his
wife
property
and
share
with
her
whatever
may
have
accumulated
during
their
cohabitation
the
singhalese
do
not
always
exercise
their
privileges
but
are
frequently
indulgent
husbands
and
forgive
offenses
which
most
people
hold
unpardonable
in
proof
of
this
a
kandian
asked
the
british
authorities
to
compel
the
return
of
an
unfaithful
wife
pleading
his
love
for
her
and
promising
to
forget
her
frailty
english
jurisdiction
did
not
extend
so
far
as
this
and
the
woman
coolly
turned
her
back
upon
her
husband
and
accompanied
her
paramour
whom
she
soon
after
deserted
for
a
third
partner
many
instances
of
this
kind
have
induced
the
native
poets
to
produce
a
number
of
satirical
effusions
upon
woman
inconstancy
and
a
traveler
translates
the
following
specimen
seen
the
in
flower
white
plumage
on
the
crow
and
fishes
footsteps
on
the
deep
have
traced
through
ebb
and
flow
if
man
it
is
who
thus
asserts
his
words
you
may
believe
but
all
that
woman
says
distrust
she
speaks
but
to
deceive
to
understand
the
first
clause
it
will
be
necessary
to
remember
that
the
adumbra
is
a
kind
of
and
the
natives
assert
that
no
mortal
has
ever
seen
it
in
bloom
infanticide
was
at
one
time
common
in
ceylon
and
all
female
children
except
the
were
liable
to
be
sacrificed
especially
if
born
under
a
malignant
planet
but
latterly
the
british
government
have
denounced
the
crime
as
murder
and
punished
it
accordingly
this
has
had
the
effect
of
gradually
abolishing
it
and
the
population
has
increased
in
consequence
the
social
condition
of
the
singhalese
women
is
not
so
degraded
as
in
other
parts
of
the
east
but
their
moral
character
does
not
correspond
profligacy
is
prevalent
open
and
acknowledged
prostitution
is
rare
excepting
in
the
towns
and
of
its
extent
there
we
have
no
reliable
particulars
under
the
kandian
dynasty
a
common
harlot
had
her
hair
and
ears
cut
off
and
was
publicly
whipped
in
a
state
of
nudity
ultra
gangetic
nations
in
this
division
we
include
the
immense
tract
lying
between
hindostan
and
china
although
these
countries
present
some
variety
of
customs
and
degrees
of
progress
yet
generally
speaking
their
manners
are
uniform
in
all
the
condition
of
women
is
extremely
low
they
are
held
in
contempt
are
taught
to
abase
themselves
in
their
own
minds
and
employ
their
license
by
degrading
themselves
still
farther
the
effect
of
asiatic
despotism
is
plainly
visible
every
man
is
the
king
serf
and
the
support
of
the
community
devolves
upon
the
women
who
in
cochin
china
especially
plow
sow
reap
fell
trees
build
and
perform
all
the

offices
civilization
assigns
to
the
stronger
sex
the
marriage
contract
is
a
mere
bargain
a
man
buys
his
wife
and
may
extend
his
purchases
as
far
as
he
pleases
the
first
bought
being
usually
the
chief
a
simple
agreement
before
witnesses
seals
the
union
which
can
be
dissolved
with
equal
facility
the
only
requisite
in
cochin
china
being
to
break
a
chopstick
or
porcupine
quill
in
presence
of
a
third
person
a
man
has
also
the
privilege
of
selling
his
inferior
wives
the
unmarried
women
are
almost
universally
unchaste
and
do
not
incur
infamy
or
lose
the
chance
of
marriage
by
prostituting
themselves
custom
allows
a
father
to
yield
his
daughter
to
any
visitor
he
may
wish
to
honor
or
to
hire
her
for
a
stipulated
price
to
any
one
desirous
of
her
company
and
she
has
no
power
to
resist
the
arrangement
although
she
can
not
be
married
against
her
will
a
wife
is
considered
sacred
more
as
the
property
of
her
husband
than
from
respect
to
her
chastity
the
theory
of
the
law
is
that
a
man
harem
can
not
be
invaded
even
by
the
king
himself
but
asiatic
absolutism
was
never
famed
for
its
adherence
to
law
when
personal
interest
was
in
the
other
scale
and
there
is
but
little
exception
in
this
case
adultery
is
punished
in
siam
by
fine
and
in
cochin
china
by
death
in
burmah
executions
of
females
are
very
rare
but
they
are
disciplined
with
the
aid
of
the
bamboo
husbands
sometimes
flogging
their
wives
in
the
open
streets
although
professed
prostitutes
exist
in
large
numbers
throughout
the
region
still
there
are
not
so
many
as
might
be
expected
because
no
single
woman
is
required
to
be
chaste
little
is
known
of
their
habits
peculiarities
or
position
except
that
in
siam
they
are
incapacitated
from
giving
evidence
before
a
justice
this
restriction
does
not
seem
to
arise
from
a
consideration
of
their
immorality
but
from
local
prejudices
and
the
disability
under
which
they
labor
is
also
extended
to
braziers
and
blacksmiths
celebes
leaving
the
asiatic
continent
for
a
short
time
we
will
now
examine
the
condition
of
the
inhabitants
of
celebes
this
island
is
noticed
here
rather
than
with
java
sumatra
and
borneo
which
are
included
in
the
list
of
barbarous
nations
because
it
enjoys
a
considerable
degree
of
civilization
and
in
its
political
and
social
state
is
far
in
advance
of
other
countries
of
the
indian
archipelago
the
idea
of
freedom
is
recognized
in
its
public
system
and
its
institutions
have
assumed
a
republican
form
women
are
not
excluded
from
their
share
in
public
business
and
though
their
influence
is
usually
indirect
their
counsel
is
sought
by
the
men
on
all
important
occasions
in
wajo
they
are
not
only
elected
to
the
throne
or
rather
the
presidential
chair
but
also
often
fill
the
great
offices
of
state
four
out
of
the
six
councilors
are
frequently
females
their
domestic
condition
to
some
extent
corresponds
with
their
political
privileges
the
wife
has
the
uncontrolled
management
of
her
household
eating
with
her
husband
and
mingling
freely
with
the
other
sex
on
public
or
festival
occasions
the
women
ride
about
transact
business
and
even
visit
foreigners
as
they
please
and
their
chastity
is
better
guarded
by
the
sense
of
honor
and
the
pride
of
virtue
than
by
the
jealousy
of
husbands
or
the
surveillance
of
parents
this
is
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
for
the
reverse
we
find
the
barbarian
practice
of
polygamy
which
is
universally
permitted
under
certain
restrictions
the
most
important
of
these
is
that
two
wives
seldom
inhabit
the
same
house
each
has
usually
a
separate
dwelling
the
men
can
easily
procure
a
divorce
and
if
the
wish
to
separate
is
mutual
nothing
remains
but
to
do
so
as
quickly
as
possible
if
the
woman
alone
desires
to
be
released
from
the
matrimonial
bond
she
must
produce
a
reasonable
ground
of
complaint
concubinage
is
rarely
practiced
although
some
man
may
take
a
woman
of
inferior
rank
as
a
companion
until
he
can
marry
a
girl
whose
birth
equals
his
own
the
morals
of
both
men
and
women
are
superior
to
those
of
any
other
race
in
eastern
or
western
asia
prostitution
is
all
but
unknown
the
dancing
girls
are
generally
admitted
to
be
of
easy
virtue
but
even
they
preserve
decorum
in
their
manners
and
dress
with
great
decency
although
their
public
performances
are
of
a
lascivious
nature
china
in
the
immense
empire
of
china
a
general
uniformity
of
manners
is
observable
for
its
civilization
has
been
cast
in
a
mould
fashioned
by
despotism
and
the
iron
discipline
of
its
government
forces
all
to
yield
there
is
great
reason
to
believe
that
prostitution
forms
no
exception
to
the
rule
we
know
that
a
remarkable
system
exists
that
frail
women
abound
in
the
celestial
empire
and
form
a
distinct
class
we
know
something
of
the
manner
in
which
they
live
and
how
or
by
whom
they
are
encouraged
but
no
traveler
has
as
yet
given
any
lucid
account
of
the
vice
and
its
connections
and
our
comparatively
meagre
knowledge
is
drawn
from
a
multiplicity
of
sources
the
general
condition
of
the
female
sex
in
china
is
inferior
to
the
male
and
the
precepts
and
examples
of
confucius
have
taught
the
people
that
the
former
were
created
for
the
convenience
of
the
latter
feminine
virtue
is
severely
guarded
by
the
law
not
for
the
sake
of
virtue
but
for
the
of
the
state
and
the
interest
of
the
men
but
national
morality
inculcated
by
codes
essays
and
poems
is
in
fact
a
dead
letter
for
the
chinese
rank
among
the
most
immoral
people
on
the
earth
the
inferiority
of
women
is
recognized
in
their
politics
which
embrace
the
spirit
of
the
salic
law
the
throne
can
be
occupied
only
by
a
man
and
an
illegitimate
son
is
more
respected
than
a
legitimate
daughter
the
paternal
government
of
china
has
not
failed
to
legislate
on
the
subject
of
marriage
in
this
contract
the
inclinations
of
the
parties
themselves
are
practically
ignored
parental
authority
is
supreme
and
it
is
not
unusual
for
weddings
to
take
place
between
persons
who
have
never
seen
each
other
before
the
union
matchmaking
is
followed
as
a
profession
by
some
old
women
who
are
remunerated
when
they
succeed
when
two
families
commence
a
negotiation
of
this
kind
all
particulars
are
required
to
be
fully
explained
on
both
sides
so
that
no
deceit
can
be
practiced
the
engagement
is
then
drawn
and
the
amount
of
presents
agreed
on
this
contract
is
irrevocable
if
the
friends
of
the
girl
desire
to
break
off
the
match
the
one
who
had
authority
to
dispose
of
her
receives
fifty
strokes
of
the
bamboo
and
the
marriage
proceeds
if
the
bridegroom
or
the
friend
who
controls
him
is
dissatisfied
he
receives
the
same
punishment
and
must
fulfill
his
engagement
if
either
of
the
parties
is
incontinent
after
betrothal
the
crime
is
punished
as
adultery
if
any
deceit
has
been
practiced
and
either
person
has
falsely
represented
the
party
about
to
be
married
the
offender
is
severely
punished
and
the
marriage
is
void
even
if
completed
in
spite
of
all
precautions
such
instances
sometimes
occur
it
must
be
noticed
that
though
betrothal
binds
a
woman
positively
to
her
future
husband
yet
he
can
not
force
her
from
her
friends
before
the
stipulated
time
has
expired
nor
can
they
retain
her
beyond
the
assigned
day
polygamy
is
allowed
under
certain
restrictions
the
first
wife
is
usually
chosen
from
a
family
equal
in
station
to
that
of
the
husband
and
acquires
all
the
rights
and
privileges
which
belong
to
a
chief
wife
in
any
asiatic
country
the
man
may
then
take
as
many
more
women
as
he
can
afford
to
keep
but
these
are
inferior
in
rank
to
the
first
married
although
the
children
have
a
contingent
claim
to
the
inheritance
this
position
if
it
brings
no
positive
honor
brings
little
shame
it
is
sanctioned
by
usage
but
was
originally
condemned
by
strict
moralists
who
designated
the
arrangement
by
a
word
compounded
of
and
it
is
a
position
which
only
a
poor
or
humble
woman
will
consent
to
occupy
a
national
proverb
says
it
is
more
honorable
to
be
the
wife
of
a
poor
man
than
the
concubine
of
an
emperor
the
social
rule
which
makes
all
subsequent
wives
subordinate
to
the
one
first
married
may
probably
have
had
some
effect
in
forming
this
opinion
the
chinese
system
is
rigid
as
to
the
degrees
of
consanguinity
between
which
marriage
may
be
contracted
in
ancient
times
the
reverse
of
this
seems
to
have
been
the
rule
and
tradition
says
that
much
immorality
was
the
result
the
law
now
prohibits
all
unions
between
persons
of
the
same
family
name
and
is
attended
with
some
inconvenience
because
the
number
of
proper
names
is
small
if
such
a
marriage
is
contracted
it
is
declared
void
and
the
parties
are
punished
by
blows
and
a
fine
if
the
couple
are
previously
related
by
marriage
within
four
degrees
the
union
is
declared
incestuous
and
the
offenders
are
punished
with
the
bamboo
or
in
extreme
cases
by
strangling
or
decapitation
not
only
are
the
degrees
of
relationship
definitely
specified
but
the
union
of
classes
is
under
restriction
an
officer
of
government
must
not
marry
into
a
family
under
his
jurisdiction
or
if
he
does
is
subject
to
a
heavy
punishment
the
same
being
accorded
to
the
girl
relations
if
they
have
voluntarily
aided
him
but
they
are
exempt
if
their
submission
was
the
result
of
his
authority
to
marry
a
woman
absconding
from
justice
is
prohibited
to
forcibly
wed
a
freeman
daughter
subjects
the
offender
to
strangulation
an
officer
of
government
or
any
hereditary
functionary
who
marries
a
woman
of
a
disreputable
class
receives
sixty
strokes
of
the
bamboo
and
the
same
awaits
any
priest
who
marries
at
all
he
being
also
expelled
from
his
order
slaves
and
free
persons
are
forbidden
to
intermarry
those
who
connive
at
an
illegal
union
are
considered
criminals
and
punished
accordingly
according
to
chinese
law
any
one
of
seven
specified
causes
are
allowed
to
justify
divorce
namely
barrenness
lasciviousness
disregard
of
the
husband
parents
talkativeness
thievish
propensities
an
envious
suspicious
temper
or
inveterate
infirmity
against
these
the
woman
has
three
pleas
any
one
of
which
if
substantiated
will
annul
the
application
they
are
that
she
has
mourned
three
years
for
her
family
that
the
family
has
become
rich
having
been
poor
at
the
time
of
marriage
or
that
she
has
no
father
or
mother
living
to
receive
her
these
are
useless
when
she
has
committed
adultery
in
which
case
her
husband
is
positively
forbidden
to
retain
her
but
under
other
circumstances
they
present
a
check
to
his
caprice
in
cases
of
adultery
a
man
may
kill
both
his
wife
and
her
paramour
if
he
detect
them
and
execute
his
vengeance
forthwith
but
he
must
not
put
her
to
death
for
any
other
crime
in
the
same
connection
may
be
mentioned
a
law
denouncing
severe
penalties
on
any
man
who
lends
his
wife
or
daughter
this
is
not
an
obsolete
enactment
against
an
unknown
offense
for
instances
do
sometimes
occur
of
poor
men
selling
their
wives
as
concubines
to
their
richer
neighbors
while
others
prostitute
them
for
gain
from
this
view
of
the
social
condition
of
women
and
the
laws
of
marriage
it
is
necessary
to
pass
to
a
subject
which
has
given
china
an
unenviable
notoriety
namely
the
custom
of
infanticide
two
causes
appear
to
have
encouraged
this
practice
the
poverty
of
the
lower
classes
and
the
severity
of
the
laws
respecting
illicit
sexual
intercourse
the
former
is
the
principal
cause
when
the
parents
are
so
indigent
as
to
have
no
hope
of
maintaining
their
children
the
daughters
are
murdered
for
a
son
can
earn
his
living
in
a
few
years
and
assist
his
parents
in
addition
among
this
class
the
birth
of
a
female
is
viewed
as
a
calamity
several
methods
are
adopted
to
destroy
the
child
it
may
be
drowned
in
warm
water
its
throat
may
be
pinched
a
wet
cloth
may
be
pressed
over
its
mouth
it
may
be
choked
with
rice
or
it
may
be
buried
alive
when
smith
a
missionary
was
in
the
suburbs
of
canton
in
he
made
many
inquiries
as
to
the
extent
of
infanticide
a
native
assured
him
that
within
a
circle
of
ten
miles
radius
the
children
killed
each
year
not
exceed
five
in
fokien
province
the
crime
was
more
general
and
at
a
place
called
kea
king
chow
there
were
computed
to
be
from
five
to
six
hundred
cases
every
month
a
foundling
hospital
at
canton
was
named
as
preventing
much
of
the
crime
but
it
seems
to
have
received
only
five
hundred
infants
yearly
but
a
very
small
proportion
of
the
births
the
chinese
generally
confess
that
infanticide
is
practiced
throughout
the
empire
and
is
regarded
as
an
innocent
and
proper
expedient
for
lightening
the
pressure
of
poverty
it
is
not
wholly
confined
to
the
poor
the
rich
resort
to
it
to
conceal
their
amours
the
laws
punish
illicit
intercourse
with
from
seventy
to
one
hundred
strokes
of
the
bamboo
if
a
child
is
born
its
support
devolves
upon
the
father
but
in
cases
where
the
connection
has
been
concealed
this
evidence
is
usually
destroyed
prostitution
prevails
to
a
prodigious
extent
seduction
and
adultery
says
williams
in
his
survey
of
the
chinese
empire
are
comparatively
infrequent
but
brothels
and
their
inmates
are
found
every
where
on
land
and
water
one
danger
attending
young
girls
walking
alone
is
that
they
will
be
stolen
for
incarceration
in
these
gates
of
hell
this
allusion
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
in
there
were
from
eight
to
ten
thousand
prostitutes
in
and
near
canton
of
whom
the
greater
portion
had
been
stolen
while
children
and
regularly
trained
for
this
life
many
kidnappers
gained
a
living
by
stealing
young
girls
and
selling
them
to
the
brothels
and
in
times
of
want
parents
have
been
known
to
lead
their
daughters
through
the
streets
and
offer
them
for
sale
a
recent
visitor
to
canton
describes
the
sale
of
children
as
an
affair
which
is
looked
upon
as
a
simple
mercantile
transaction
some
are
disposed
of
for
concubines
but
others
are
deliberately
bartered
to
be
brought
up
as
prostitutes
and
are
transferred
at
once
to
the
brothels
of
chinese
houses
of
prostitution
we
have
no
particular
description
but
one
singular
feature
is
the
brothel
junks
which
are
moored
in
conspicuous
stations
on
the
pearl
river
and
are
distinguished
by
their
superior
decorations
many
of
them
are
called
flower
boats
and
form
whole
avenues
in
the
floating
suburbs
of
canton
the
women
lead
a
life
of
reckless
extravagance
plunging
into
all
the
excitements
which
are
offered
by
their
mode
of
life
to
release
themselves
from
or
reflection
diseases
are
very
prevalent
among
them
and
visitors
suffer
severely
for
their
temporary
pleasures
they
are
usually
congregated
in
troops
under
the
government
of
a
man
who
is
answerable
for
their
conduct
or
for
any
violation
of
public
peace
or
decency
the
last
can
scarcely
be
considered
an
offense
for
the
chinese
make
a
display
of
their
visits
to
brothels
persons
pass
to
and
from
the
flower
boats
without
any
attempt
at
concealment
and
rich
men
sometimes
make
up
a
party
send
to
one
of
the
junks
retain
as
many
women
as
they
wish
and
collectively
pass
the
time
in
debauch
and
licentiousness
this
is
not
the
only
form
prostitution
assumes
in
china
women
of
the
poorer
classes
whose
friends
are
not
able
to
provide
for
them
are
lodged
in
prison
under
the
care
of
female
warders
and
these
employ
their
prisoners
in
prostitution
for
their
benefit
an
incident
which
occurred
at
shenshee
a
few
years
since
reveals
another
phase
a
young
widow
resided
there
with
her
both
being
supported
by
the
prostitution
of
the
former
her
charms
failed
she
was
deserted
by
her
visitors
and
starvation
seemed
inevitable
the
old
woman
would
not
recognize
her
daughter
inability
to
support
her
and
flogged
her
the
prostitute
in
attempting
killed
her
mother
she
was
convicted
of
the
crime
but
as
the
victim
had
acted
illegally
in
endeavoring
to
force
her
to
prostitution
the
sentence
of
the
court
which
had
ordered
her
to
be
hewn
to
pieces
was
commuted
into
decapitation
as
before
remarked
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
we
have
not
more
reliable
information
of
the
vice
which
is
acknowledged
to
be
all
but
universal
in
china
japan
the
recent
connection
established
by
american
enterprise
with
the
empire
of
japan
the
zipangi
of
columbus
makes
the
institutions
of
that
country
more
than
usually
interesting
from
the
earliest
accounts
of
the
dutch
and
jesuit
writers
to
the
present
time
we
know
that
the
japanese
like
the
chinese
have
attained
a
high
degree
of
civilization
and
among
both
the
vices
which
in
the
present
experience
of
mankind
seem
the
accompaniments
of
that
improvement
have
been
developed
in
a
remarkable
degree
among
savage
tribes
female
honor
is
held
in
very
little
esteem
the
woman
is
merely
property
as
we
advance
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
they
take
higher
grade
and
virtue
and
modesty
are
more
cherished
our
information
concerning
japan
is
even
yet
comparatively
limited
but
no
circumstance
of
its
ordinary
life
seems
more
clear
than
that
female
virtue
among
the
higher
classes
is
much
valued
and
that
at
the
same
time
there
is
an
enormous
extent
of
public
prostitution
in
which
men
of
all
ranks
indulge
the
jesuit
charleroix
koempfer
adams
and
some
dutch
writers
have
given
accounts
of
japan
from
the
sixteenth
century
to
the
present
time
like
most
oriental
nations
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
japanese
have
undergone
so
little
change
that
the
practices
of
a
century
ago
are
the
fashions
of
the
most
recent
traveler
for
those
who
composed
commodore
perry
expedition
can
hardly
be
said
to
come
under
that
denomination
is
captain
golownin
and
he
had
opportunities
for
close
observation
not
equaled
since
the
times
of
the
early
writers
he
was
commander
of
the
russian
diana
and
visited
the
japanese
empire
in
having
paid
a
visit
of
ceremony
ashore
he
was
induced
by
the
duplicity
of
the
japanese
who
are
adepts
in
all
the
political
arts
of
lying
and
hypocrisy
to
trust
himself
in
their
hands
a
second
time
without
arms
or
escort
the
japanese
had
an
old
grudge
to
settle
with
the
russians
on
account
of
injuries
done
them
by
certain
individuals
of
that
nation
and
took
the
opportunity
of
rendering
a
pro
by
entrapping
the
unlucky
golownin
who
was
thus
made
prisoner
he
was
treated
at
first
with
much
indignity
and
severity
afterward
with
more
indulgence
but
did
not
regain
his
liberty
for
upward
of
two
years
the
japanese
can
marry
only
one
wife
but
have
as
many
concubines
as
they
please
the
precise
value
of
the
distinction
is
not
readily
appreciated
as
the
concubine
does
not
lose
caste
by
her
position
there
are
great
facilities
of
divorce
and
without
cause
shown
but
a
gentleman
who
exercises
this
privilege
loses
his
character
as
a
husband
and
can
only
procure
another
wife
or
additional
concubines
by
paying
a
large
price
to
his
adultery
is
punished
with
death
either
by
law
or
at
the
hands
of
the
husband
japanese
husbands
are
represented
as
jealous
and
as
keeping
their
wives
and
women
in
strict
seclusion
this
strictness
is
relaxed
in
the
cases
of
the
middle
and
poorer
classes
the
necessities
of
the
household
removing
those
artificial
obligations
imposed
on
the
higher
ranks
by
pride
or
fashion
but
even
the
women
of
the
humbler
ranks
do
not
converse
with
or
even
speak
to
strangers
unless
in
the
presence
of
their
husbands
an
anecdote
is
told
in
adams
narrative
which
somewhat
resembles
that
of
lucretia
in
roman
history
and
which
would
imply
great
among
the
high
caste
of
japanese
ladies
a
nobleman
made
dishonorable
advances
toward
a
lady
of
rank
during
her
husband
absence
on
a
journey
and
notwithstanding
a
repulse
from
her
seized
an
opportunity
to
gratify
his
passion
by
violence
on
the
husband
return
the
wife
treated
him
with
reserve
and
declined
any
explanation
of
her
singular
conduct
which
however
she
promised
to
afford
at
a
banquet
to
be
given
the
following
day
accordingly
during
the
feast
at
which
the
author
of
the
outrage
was
present
when
the
guests
had
satisfied
their
appetites
the
lady
made
her
appearance
she
told
her
husband
and
his
friends
what
had
happened
denounced
herself
as
unworthy
to
live
received
the
caresses
of
her
husband
and
relations
by
whom
however
she
refused
to
be
comforted
and
then
leaped
from
the
parapet
of
the
house
and
so
killed
herself
meanwhile
the
criminal
had
escaped
but
when
the
guests
rushed
out
to
pick
up
the
devoted
wife
they
found
the
nobleman
weltering
in
his
own
blood
at
her
side
he
had
ripped
himself
up
the
ordinary
way
of
committing
suicide
in
japan
the
japanese
brothels
are
of
great
splendor
and
very
numerously
frequented
containing
thirty
forty
fifty
or
even
a
larger
number
of
women
every
place
of
public
entertainment
or
refreshment
maintains
prostitutes
as
a
part
of
the
establishment
on
stopping
at
a
tavern
it
is
customary
for
the
courtesans
of
the
house
to
come
out
painted
and
bedizened
and
set
forth
the
claims
of
their
house
to
the
patronage
exhibiting
themselves
as
one
of
the
items
of
the
bill
of
fare
no
village
however
insignificant
is
without
one
or
more
houses
of
ill
fame
and
there
are
villages
on
roads
in
popular
districts
the
whole
of
whose
female
inhabitants
are
prostitutes
two
in
particular
agasaki
and
goy
are
thus
described
by
koempfer
the
females
are
designated
which
literally
signifies
a
castle
turned
upside
down
it
is
uncertain
whether
the
government
licenses
these
places
or
merely
tolerates
them
the
former
is
the
more
probable
when
it
is
considered
that
in
their
mythology
they
have
a
goddess
analogous
to
the
corinthian
venus
in
whose
worship
prostitution
is
a
recognized
part
of
the
ceremony
attached
to
the
temple
of
this
impure
deity
are
a
large
number
of
priestesses
six
hundred
or
upward
who
all
prostitute
themselves
to
the
worshipers
notwithstanding
this
large
force
there
are
constant
offers
to
recruit
the
ranks
by
young
girls
the
extent
of
this
vice
which
is
universal
throughout
the
empire
would
cause
it
to
be
taken
as
a
regular
institution
of
japan
nothing
is
done
courtesans
form
part
of
a
pleasure
party
parents
sell
their
children
to
or
apprentice
them
for
a
time
to
such
places
and
at
the
expiration
of
their
term
they
resume
it
is
said
but
this
is
doubtful
their
places
in
society
without
any
stain
on
their
reputations
husbands
make
bargains
for
the
transfer
of
their
wives
charms
which
is
a
legitimate
charge
over
and
above
the
gratuity
to
be
accorded
to
the
lady
koempfer
in
describing
the
prostitute
quarter
of
nagasaki
says
it
consists
of
very
handsome
houses
the
poor
people
sell
their
prettiest
daughters
to
the
who
bring
the
girls
up
with
various
accomplishments
the
price
of
these
women
is
regulated
by
law
and
many
of
the
prostitutes
are
enabled
to
abandon
their
calling
for
their
good
education
and
agreeable
manners
procure
them
husbands
and
in
their
married
condition
they
are
fully
as
good
as
others
in
his
lifetime
the
is
said
by
some
writers
to
rank
with
the
skinner
or
tanner
an
opprobrious
calling
while
others
say
he
ranks
with
merchants
and
his
company
is
not
deemed
objectionable
this
latter
statement
if
true
may
be
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
he
holds
a
government
license
in
japan
as
in
china
the
crown
is
the
fountain
of
all
distinction
and
every
government
official
has
peculiar
privileges
and
a
distinct
position
in
the
social
scale
after
his
death
however
the
is
held
in
great
disesteem
the
sanctity
of
the
to
which
particular
reverence
attaches
would
be
polluted
by
his
unholy
presence
and
his
odious
remains
are
denied
the
rite
of
sepulture
and
are
dragged
in
the
clothes
in
which
he
died
to
a
dunghill
there
to
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
and
birds
of
prey
prostitution
as
a
public
institution
is
said
to
have
been
introduced
into
japan
by
a
certain
warlike
emperor
or
usurper
who
leading
his
troops
from
one
place
to
another
in
the
empire
feared
lest
from
want
of
home
comforts
and
domestic
ties
they
might
become
disgusted
and
abandon
his
service
accordingly
as
a
substitute
for
lawful
enjoyments
he
had
stations
for
bands
of
prostitutes
at
various
points
to
the
nearest
of
which
he
led
his
fatigued
soldiers
after
his
engagements
another
statement
as
to
the
origin
of
this
system
is
that
on
one
occasion
during
a
revolution
the
spiritual
emperor
having
fled
attended
by
his
and
a
numerous
band
of
female
attendants
temporary
nuns
the
emperor
and
his
drowned
themselves
in
fear
of
capture
by
the
enemies
whereupon
the
attendant
nuns
cut
off
from
all
other
resource
adopted
libertinism
as
a
means
of
livelihood
and
this
gave
the
first
public
example
and
sanction
to
a
reprobate
state
of
life
there
are
in
japan
various
religious
institutions
of
a
character
similar
to
convents
and
monasteries
the
vow
of
celibacy
and
chastity
is
one
of
the
requisites
of
this
state
yet
notwithstanding
this
vow
the
monks
are
described
as
living
very
intemperately
seducing
both
women
and
girls
and
committing
other
shameful
enormities
among
the
mendicant
religious
orders
to
which
both
sexes
belong
the
nuns
are
numerous
they
are
described
as
being
very
women
they
are
generally
the
children
of
indigent
parents
and
good
looks
are
essential
to
success
in
their
calling
between
which
and
prostitution
there
seems
no
difference
save
in
name
indeed
many
of
these
mendicant
nuns
go
direct
from
the
brothel
to
their
new
employment
which
combining
various
qualifications
is
probably
more
lucrative
we
have
been
unable
to
find
any
information
as
to
the
nature
or
extent
of
venereal
diseases
if
any
in
japan
of
infanticide
also
we
have
no
account
commodore
perry
in
the
narrative
of
his
expedition
confirms
the
facts
above
stated
so
far
as
his
opportunities
for
observation
extended
difficulties
were
at
first
thrown
in
the
way
of
his
seeing
the
japanese
women
and
when
he
walked
about
the
interpreters
preceded
him
and
under
a
show
of
doing
him
honor
ordered
all
the
women
into
their
houses
afterward
on
the
commodore
remonstrance
the
women
were
allowed
to
make
their
appearance
and
their
manners
and
looks
were
not
by
any
means
unpleasing
when
the
officers
of
the
expedition
were
entertained
they
sometimes
waited
on
the
party
with
tea
coffee
and
other
refreshments
their
manners
were
mild
their
countenances
were
soft
and
pleasing
the
only
objectionable
point
about
them
being
the
abominable
habit
of
blackening
their
teeth
with
a
highly
corrosive
pigment
partly
composed
of
iron
filings
and
a
fermented
liquor
called
saki
which
affected
the
gums
very
offensively
and
caused
an
appearance
and
odor
decidedly
unpleasing
to
the
tastes
of
western
travelers
the
women
of
the
working
classes
were
engaged
in
hard
field
and
labor
but
not
to
a
greater
extent
than
in
densely
populated
countries
in
most
parts
of
the
world
commodore
perry
assumes
that
licentiousness
must
be
prevalent
in
large
cities
but
he
bears
his
testimony
to
the
good
conduct
of
the
women
whom
the
people
of
the
expedition
met
while
on
shore
the
opportunities
of
information
and
particular
inquiry
were
however
not
very
great
owing
to
the
more
important
political
objects
of
the
visit
and
the
not
very
protracted
stay
of
the
squadron
in
japan
not
content
with
the
excess
of
incontinence
in
which
the
japanese
as
a
nation
indulge
they
largely
practice
unnatural
vices
and
the
youth
of
the
province
of
kioto
which
is
the
peculiar
appanage
of
the
spiritual
emperor
are
celebrated
on
account
of
their
beauty
and
command
a
high
price
in
this
horrid
traffic
tartar
races
central
asia
is
but
little
known
and
seldom
visited
among
the
most
remarkable
of
its
people
are
the
kirghiz
kazaks
who
form
a
nation
of
shepherds
they
dwell
in
huts
or
temporary
habitations
of
covered
with
fleeces
and
are
a
robust
hardy
race
addicted
to
sensual
enjoyments
their
manners
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
female
sex
are
coarse
but
it
is
curious
to
remark
that
while
the
men
are
indolent
and
licentious
the
women
are
fond
of
exertion
for
which
their
only
recompense
is
to
be
treated
as
slaves
the
kirghiz
when
rich
enough
eagerly
avail
themselves
of
the
privilege
of
polygamy
indeed
this
part
of
the
mohammedan
creed
is
the
one
they
have
embraced
with
most
ardor
yet
few
possess
sufficient
wealth
to
marry
more
than
one
wife
the
price
paid
for
a
woman
will
range
from
five
or
six
sheep
among
the
poorer
classes
to
two
hundred
five
hundred
or
even
a
thousand
horses
among
the
rich
to
which
are
added
different
household
effects
and
occasionally
a
few
male
or
female
slaves
a
considerable
share
of
these
payments
is
absorbed
by
the
mohammedan
moolahs
who
find
a
profitable
source
of
revenue
in
marrying
these
people
they
consecrate
the
union
as
soon
as
projected
and
immediately
the
amount
of
the
or
price
has
been
arranged
between
the
parties
the
moolah
solemnly
asks
the
parents
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
do
you
consent
to
the
union
of
the
children
repeating
the
question
three
times
to
each
and
then
reading
prayers
for
the
happiness
of
the
couple
to
be
married
no
marriage
is
complete
till
the
whole
of
the
stipulated
amount
is
paid
but
neither
party
can
honorably
retract
after
the
first
installment
has
been
offered
and
accepted
from
that
time
the
bridegroom
has
leave
to
visit
his
bride
if
he
engages
not
to
take
away
her
chastity
in
cases
where
this
liberty
leads
to
an
anticipation
of
the
final
ceremony
the
unpaid
portion
of
the
is
not
allowed
to
protract
the
union
which
is
hastened
as
much
as
possible
if
a
man
find
his
wife
to
have
been
incontinent
before
he
married
her
he
may
return
her
to
her
parents
and
demand
the
restitution
of
her
price
or
the
substitution
of
one
of
her
sisters
if
he
actually
detects
her
in
the
commission
of
adultery
he
may
kill
her
otherwise
the
adulterer
is
fined
and
the
wife
may
be
divorced
or
chastised
the
morals
of
the
kirghiz
are
good
chastity
in
the
woman
is
highly
prized
and
the
sensuality
of
the
men
is
served
by
prostitutes
who
live
in
each
camp
either
in
companies
or
in
separate
tents
numbers
of
these
women
appear
wherever
the
russians
have
encampments
and
virulent
disease
among
them
has
tended
rapidly
to
thin
the
people
the
prostitutes
are
composed
of
two
classes
widows
and
divorced
women
who
have
no
other
means
of
subsistence
and
linger
out
a
miserable
life
in
dirt
rags
and
contempt
and
a
few
who
addict
themselves
to
prostitution
from
mere
licentiousness
circassia
the
race
known
as
abassians
considered
the
aborigines
of
the
caucasus
were
described
by
strabo
as
a
predatory
people
pirates
at
sea
and
robbers
on
land
these
characteristics
they
preserve
to
the
present
day
but
otherwise
they
are
a
virtuous
nation
strange
to
the
worst
vices
of
civilized
life
and
humble
in
their
desires
their
religion
permits
polygamy
but
as
wives
are
costly
they
are
usually
contented
with
one
who
is
the
companion
rather
than
the
menial
of
her
husband
the
women
are
industrious
are
allowed
full
liberty
and
are
free
in
their
social
intercourse
the
veil
being
worn
only
to
screen
their
complexions
and
not
for
seclusion
their
laws
against
immorality
are
stringent
an
act
of
illicit
intercourse
is
punished
by
fine
or
banishment
a
dishonest
wife
is
returned
to
her
parents
and
by
them
sold
as
a
slave
as
is
also
a
wanton
girl
illegitimate
children
can
not
claim
any
relationship
and
if
sold
as
slaves
or
assassinated
no
one
is
expected
to
redeem
them
in
the
one
case
or
avenge
them
in
the
other
when
a
man
desires
to
divorce
his
wife
he
must
give
his
reasons
before
a
council
of
elders
and
if
they
are
not
satisfied
he
must
pay
her
parents
a
stated
amount
to
recompense
them
for
the
burden
thus
thrown
upon
them
should
the
woman
marry
again
within
two
years

a

introduce
his

at

they
observe
one
singular
custom
a
husband
never
appears
abroad
with
his
wife
and
scarcely
ever
sees
her
during
the
day
this
is
in

with
ancient
habits

is
a
prolongation
of

requires
a

after
he
has

by

is

leading

if
she

there
is
a
general
opinion
that
circassians
will
sell
their
daughters
to
any
turk
or
persian
who
wishes
to
buy
them

this
is
not

they
are

great
precautions

of

the

and
depraved
in

tastes
the
turk
is
too
indolent
to
acquire
even
the
means
of
gratifying
his
most
powerful
cravings
satisfying
his
pride
with
the
memory
of
former
glories
his
lust
looks
forward
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
paradise
crowded
with
beautiful
ministers
of
pleasure
and
he
passes
his
time
in
an
atmosphere
of
epicurean
speculation
lounging
on
cushions
and
sipping
coffee
with
a
dreamy
indifference

the

positive
want

spend
the
rest
of
their
time
waiting
the
sensual
heaven
promised
by
their
prophet
in
such
a
lethargy
the
most
violent
passions
are
fostered
and
when
these
become
excited
the
turk
can
not
be

polygamy
is
now
growing
into
disrepute
there
recent
laws
have
conferred
many
privileges
upon
women
in
matters
of
property
and
their
comparative
independence
has
rendered
them
averse
to
a
position
in
which
they
only
acquire

their

this
stipulation
is
very
seldom
violated
the
customs
of
the
country
do
not
permit
a
man
to
see
his
wife
before
marriage
she
may
gratify
her
curiosity
by
a
stealthy
glance
at
him
but
this
privilege
is
seldom
used
in

of
the
separation
of

the

is
occupied
with
rejoicings

expends

the

the
dancing
girls
of

are
prostitutes
by
profession
their
performances
are
much
enjoyed
by
all
classes

they
dance
as
lasciviously

they
are
often
invited
to
amuse
the

a

is
drawn
up

he
supports

while
he
remains
when
he
is

of
her

wishes
to
leave

she
returns
to

particularly
as
an
account
of
algeria
under
the
french
has
already
been
given
the
mass
of
the
population
are
moors
and
therefore
our
remarks
will
mainly
apply
to
them
like
the
turks
they
are
proud
ignorant
sensual
and
depraved
and
their
treatment
of
women
exactly
accords
with
this
character
they
regard
the
female
sex
but
as
material
instruments
of
man
gratification
and
this
idea
is
become
so
generally
received
that
the
sole
education
of
a
girl
is
such
as
will
render
her
acceptable
to
some
gross
sensualist
intellect
and
sentiment
are
not
the
possessions
which
will
recommend
her

attractive
she
must
be
a
girl
of
such
bulk
as
to
be
a
good
load
for
a
camel
is
considered
a
perfect
beauty
and
accordingly
the
mother
does
not
train
her
daughter
in
seductive
arts
but
feeds
her
into
a
seductive
appearance
as
pigeons
are
fed
in

parts

she
is
made

swallow
every
day

any
reluctance
she
may

the

are
extremely
jealous
of
their
enormous

some
have
been

to
kill
their
women

others

forbidden
them

an
extensive
system

the
public
dancers
who
all
belong
to
the
sisterhood
exist
in
large
numbers
and
are
very
much
encouraged
their
society
is
a
favorite
recreation
with
moors
of
all
classes
a
man
entertaining
a
party
of
friends
will
send
for
a
company
of
dancers
to
amuse
them
there
amid
the
fumes
of
tobacco
and
sometimes
of
liquor
for
the
precepts
of
the
koran
are
disregarded
on
such
occasions
the
women
practice
the
most
degrading
obscenities
and
the
orgies
become
such

describe
these
prostitutes

classes
from
the

vulgar
wretches

the

a
late
traveler
was
introduced
by
a
friend
to
a
moorish
lady
he
was
ushered
into
a
spacious
apartment
hung
with
silks
reclining
on
a
splendid
divan
with
every
appliance
of
wealth
around
her
was
a
woman
of
extreme
loveliness
elegant
in
her
manners
and
address
she
seemed
a
model
of
feminine
grace
nor
did
the
visitor
discover
until
after
he
had
left
her
that
he
had
been
conversing
with
a
moorish
prostitute
siberia
the
state
of
manners
to
which
the
population
of
these
snowy
tracts
has
arrived
is
very
low
they
are
rude
ignorant
and
gross
the
condition
and
character
of
the
female
sex
correspond
with
that
of
the
male
in
the
perpetual
migration
of
tribes
they
bear
the
heaviest
burdens
and
in
their
habitations
the
man
regards
his
wife
as
a
mere
domestic
slave
to
whom
it
is
unnecessary
even
to
speak
a
kind
word
there
are
some
exceptions
to
this
rule
especially
toward
the
centre
of
the
district
removed
from
russia
on
the
one
hand
and
the
sea
on
the
other
where
more
equality
of
the
sexes
is
observable
a
wife
is
generally
obtained
by
purchase
and
if
a
man
is
not
rich
enough
to
pay
the
sum
demanded
by
the
parents
of
a
girl
for
the
privilege
of
marrying
her
he
hires
himself
to
them
for
a
term
ranging
from
three
to
ten
years
according
to
an
agreement
and
his
services
in
that
time
are
considered
equivalent
to
the
value
of
his
bride
these
contracts
are
faithfully
observed
the
woman
is
invariably
given
up
at
the
specified
time
and
the
man
released
from
his
servile
condition
and
admitted
to
all
the
dignities
and
rights
of
a
where
the
bridegroom
is
in
a
condition
to
pay
for
his
bride
the
preliminary
negotiations
are
managed
by
his
friends
and
her
parents
they
are
very
quietly
arranged
but
the
spirit
of
bargaining
is
strong
on
both
sides
the
stipulated
amount
must
be
paid
before
the
marriage
is
completed
and
if
a
man
steals
away
his
bride
before
he
has
paid
the
full
cost
the
father
watches
an
opportunity
and
recaptures
her
retaining
her
in
pledge
until
the
balance
is
forthcoming
the
marriage
ceremonies
vary
in
different
tribes
with
some
there
is
no
feast
or
form
of
any
kind
with
others
every
marriage
must
take
place
in
a
hut
where
no
impure
things
can
have
been
the
most
detailed
account
of
marriage
ceremonies
we
can
find
is
among
the
tschuwasses
they
offer
a
sacrifice
of
bread
and
honey
to
the
sun
on
the
betrothal
that
he
may
look
down
with
favor
on
the
union
when
the
arrives
the
bride
hides
herself
behind
a
screen
while
the
guests
are
assembling
when
the
party
is
complete
she
walks
three
times
round
the
room
followed
by
a
train
of
virgins
bearing
bread
and
honey
then
the
bridegroom
enters
removes
her
veil
kisses
her
and
they
exchange
rings
she
is
now
saluted
as
the
betrothed
girl
and
is
again
led
behind
the
screen
whence
she
emerges
wearing
a
matron
cap
the
concluding
rite
is
for
her
to
pull
off
her
new
husband
boots
thus
promising
obedience
to
him
in
this
tribe
the
husband
can
divorce
his
wife
by
merely
taking
her
cap
from
her
head
polygamy
is
practiced
by
many
though
some
prefer
to
take
one
wife
for
another
as
often
as
inclination
prompts
them
rather
than
take
charge
of
several
at
the

time
jealousy
is
little
known
among
any
of
the
races
of
siberia
modesty
is
not
a
female
characteristic
nor
is
chastity
very
highly
prized
if
a
wife
commit
adultery
the
husband
usually
exacts
a
fine
from
the
paramour
for
invading
his
rights
without
permission
their
barbarous
manners
would
not
induce
us
to
expect
any
refined
modesty
a
traveler
was
introduced
to
the
family
of
a
rich
man
the
head
of
a
tribe
and
upon
entering
his
but
spacious
habitation
found
himself
in
company
with
five
or
six
women
wives
and
daughters
all
entirely
naked
who
appeared
excessively
diverted
at
being
discovered
in
such
a
state
the
dancing
women
are
as
lewd
as
can
possibly
be
conceived
indeed
obscene
postures
are
the
principal
features
of
their
entertainments
a
licentious
intercourse
between
unmarried
persons
is
almost
universal
with
some
religious
dissensions
are
extremely
bitter
but
profligacy
is
more
powerful
and
a
woman
who
would
rigidly
refuse
to
eat
or
drink
with
a
man
of
some
other
creed
will
prostitute
herself
to
him
from
sheer
lust
abandoned
women
reside
in
all
the
towns
in
large
numbers
and
are
scarcely
reprobated
by
other
classes
the
education
of
a
siberian
girl
appears
to
be
simply
telling
her
that
marriage
is
her
destiny
and
that
her
husband
will
require
her
to
be
faithful
with
this
view
she
forms
acquaintances
is
seduced
by
one
and
yields
to
another
until
her
profligacy
becomes
so
notorious
that
no
one
will
purchase
her
as
a
wife
and
she
follows
as
a
means
of
living
the
habits
she
had
resorted
to
for
the
indulgence
of
her
vicious
appetite
it
is
said
that
many
prostitutes
become
so
from
this
cause

the
esquimaux
require
but
a
very
short
notice
as
a
race
they
are
dirty
poor
and
immoral
dishonesty
is
a
prominent
characteristic
especially
manifested
toward
any
strangers
coming
within
their
reach
the
lamented
kane
in
his
arctic
explorations
mentions
the
trouble
to
which
he
was
exposed
in
guarding
his
stores
from
their
pilfering
propensities
but
after
he
had
administered
one
or
two
lessons
of
chastisement
they
abandoned
this
habit
and
became
of
great
assistance
to
him
he
says
there
is
a
frankness
and
cordiality
in
their
way
of
receiving
their
guests
whatever
may
be
the
infirmities
of
their
notions
of
honesty
and
when
he
parted
from
them
on
his
perilous
journey
south
he
remarks
when
trouble
came
to
us
and
them
and
we
bent
ourselves
to
their
habits
when
we
looked
to
them
to
procure
us
fresh
meat
and
they
found
at
our
brig
shelter
during
their
wild
never
were
friends
more
true
although
numberless
articles
of
inestimable
value
to
them
have
been
scattered
upon
the
ice
unwatched
they
have
not
stolen
a
nail
the
esquimaux
women
are
not
absolute
slaves
their
duties
are
almost
entirely
domestic
and
during
the
winter
especially
their
life
is
one
of
ease
and
pleasure
so
far
as
their
notions
can
comprehend
such
advantages

inside

two
or
three
families
together
they
spend
their
time
in

and
sleeping
alternately
both
sexes
being
perfectly
naked
except
a
small
apron
worn
by
the
women
as
a
badge
of
their
sex
this
nudity
arises
from
the
excessive
heat
of
their
cabins
which
are
rendered
impervious
to
the
cold
outside
kane
mentions
one
occasion
on
which
he
was
a
visitor
when
the
thermometer
outside
stood
at
below
zero
and
inside
the
temperature
mounted

says
bursting
into

thus
an

i
fell

respecting
the
morality
of
the
men
or
the
virtue
of
the

little
is
known
parry
says
that
husbands
frequently
offer
their
wives
to
strangers
for
a
very
small
sum
and
also
that
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
change
of
wives
to
be
made
for
a
short
time
he
adds
that
in
no
country
is
prostitution
carried
to
a
greater
extent
the
departure
of
the
men
on
an
expedition

a
signal
to
their
wives
to
abandon
all
restraint

rules
paramount
and
the
children
are
taught
to
watch
outside
the
hut
lest
the
husband
should
return
unexpectedly
and
find
his
habitation
occupied
by
a
stranger
their
marriage
contract
is
a
mere
social
arrangement
easily
dissolved
but
this
is
rarely
done
the
general
custom
being
for
a
man
to
chastise
his
wife
when
she
displeases
him
the
usual
form
of

discipline
consists
in
forcing
her
to

kane
is
of
opinion
that
the
services
of
the
lutheran
and

missionaries
have
produced
a
beneficial
influence
on
the
morals
of
the
people
what
may
be
called
their
normal
religious
notions
extended
only
to
the
recognition
of
supernatural
agencies
and
to
certain
usages
by
which
these
could
be
conciliated

were
not
considered
crimes

have
aided

made

ravages
among

thin

impress
them
with
the
idea
that
they
are
so
rapidly
dying
out
as
to
be
able
to
mark
their
progress
toward
extinction
within

this
is
more
applicable
to

from

of

murder
and

still
exist

now
the

not

render

essentially
a

how
long

you
observed
any
of
its
requirements
in
addition
to
this
comprehensive
series
space
was
left
for
any
remarks
the
examiner
might
wish
to
make
upon
other
points
the
queries
were
printed
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
with
sufficient
blanks
for
the
answers
and
the
officer
was
desired
as
soon
as
he
had
obtained
all
the
information
required
to
fold
the
sheet
and
sign
his
name
on
a
line
left
for
that
purpose
with
the
date
the
inquiries
were
made
the
locality
of
the
house
in
which
the
woman
resided
and
the
police
district
in
which
it
was
comprised
it
is
a
matter
of
much
regret
that
in
the
burning
of
the
island
hospital
blackwell
island
on
february
all
the
schedules
were
destroyed
they
contained
many
facts
which
from
want
of
space
are
but
slightly
alluded
to
in
the
following
pages
and
would
have
been
of
material
service
in
any
measures
hereafter
taken
to
mitigate
the
sorrows
or
prevent
the
excesses
of
the
abandoned
women
of
new
york
farther
prelude
is
unnecessary
it
only
remains
to
give
the
answers
as
received
with
such
deductions
as
may
arise
from
them
how
old
will
you
be
next
age
number
years
total
the
facts
exhibited
by
this
table
are
sufficiently
palpable
to
render
remarks
almost
unnecessary
but
the
existence
of
juvenile
degradation
is
so
clearly
proven
as
to
call
for
a
few
observations
between
the
ages
of
fifteen
and
twenty
years
are
found
about
three
eighths
of
the
whole
number
embraced
in
this
return
between
the
ages
of
and
years
nearly
three
eighths
more
of
the
whole
number
are
included
giving
in
the
first
ten
years
of
the
table
three
quarters
of
the
aggregate
prostitution
while
the
next
period
of
five
years
or
from
to
thirty
contains
one
eighth
more
it
is
thus
upon
record
that
seven
out
of
every
eight
women
who
came
under
this
investigation
had
not
yet
reached
thirty
years
of
age
beyond
this
standard
each
year
shows
but
a
few
and
of
these
veterans
the
majority
are
those
who
are
now
keeping
houses
of
ill
fame
comparing
this
with
the
ages
of
residents
in
new
york
as
given
in
the
census
reports
it
will
appear
that
prostitutes
under
twenty
years
of
age
are
in
excess
about
per
cent
as
this
inquiry
shows
that
every
four
abandoned
women
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
thirty
there
are
three
between
fifteen
and
but
the
official
classification
proves
that
for
every
four
women
in
the
state
between
twenty
and
thirty
years
old
there
are
between
fifteen
and
twenty
while
juvenile
degradation
is
an
inseparable
adjunct
of
prostitution
premature
old
age
is
its
invariable
result
take
for
example
the
career
of
a
female
who
enters
a
house
of
prostitution
at
sixteen
years
of
age
her
step
is
elastic
her
eye
bright
she
is
the
observed
of
all
observers
the
of
the
place
flock
around
her
gloat
over
her
ruin
while
they
praise
her
beauty
and
try
to
drag
her
down
to
their
own
level
of
depravity
while
flattering
her
vanity
as
the
last
spark
of
inherent
virtue
flickers
and
dies
in
her
bosom
and
she
becomes
sensible
that
she
is
indeed
lost
that
her
anticipated
happiness
proves
but
splendid
misery
she
also
becomes
conscious
that
the
door
of
reformation
is
practically
closed
against
her
but
this
life
of
gay
depravity
can
not
last
her
mind
becomes
tainted
with
the
moral
miasma
in
which
she
lives
her
physical
powers
wane
under
the
trials
imposed
upon
them
and
her
career
in
a
fashionable
house
of
prostitution
comes
to
an
end
she
must
descend
in
the
ladder
of
vice
follow
her
from
one
step
to
another
in
her
downward
career
you
may
find
her
in
our
aristocratic
promenades
she
will
be
forced
to
walk
in
more
secluded
streets
you
may
see
her
glittering
at
one
of
the
fashionable
theatres
she
will
be
found
in
some
one
of
the
infamous
resorts
which
abound
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
she
may
associate
with
the
wealthy
of
the
land
none
will
be
too
low
for
her
company
she
has
servants
to
do
her
bidding
she
may
be
buried
in
a
coffin
and
a
nameless
grave
this
is
no
fancy
sketch
but
an
outline
of
the
course
of
many
women
now
living
as
prostitutes
of
the
lowest
class
in
the
city
of
new
york
any
one
conversant
with
the
subject
knows
that
there
is
a
well
understood
gradation
in
this
life
and
as
soon
as
a
woman
ceases
to
be
attractive
in
the
higher
walks
as
soon
as
her
youth
and
beauty
fade
she
must
either
descend
in
the
scale
nor
will
any
deny
that
of
those
who
commence
a
life
of
shame
in
their
youth
under
the
most
specious
and
flattering
delusions
the
majority
are
found
in
a
short
time
plunged
into
the
deepest
misery
and
degradation
here
is
seen
at
a
glance
a
reason
for
the
large
number
of
juvenile
prostitutes
youth
is
a
marketable
commodity
and
when
its
charms
are
lost
they
must
be
replaced
the
following
cases
from

will
substantiate
this
view
for
obvious
reasons
the

are
suppressed

the

selection
taken

it
is
not

to
pursue
this
subject
farther
as
sufficient
facts
have
been
adduced
to
support
the
assertion
that

is
the
grand
desideratum

been
traced
from

haunts

have
been
shown
as
suffering
pain
and
sickness
in
a
public
institution
or
dying
there
in
torture
but
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
calculate
the

produced
in
the
respective
families
they
had
abandoned
the
excruciating
parental
agony
caused
by
the
departure
of
a
daughter
from
the
paths
of
virtue
seems
more
a
matter
for
private
contemplation
by
each
reader
than
for
any
delineation
here
we
have
witnessed
the
meetings
of
parents
with
their
lost
children
have
stood
beside
the
bed
where
a
frail
suffering
woman
was
yielding
her
last
breath
and
have
shuddered
at
the
awful
mental
agony
overpowering
her
physical
suffering
no
doubt
can
exist
that
were
it
possible
to
introduce
the
reader
of
these
pages
to
such
scenes
or
even
could
they
be
adequately
described
in
all
their
accumulated
horrors
the
cordial
of
all
the
friends
of
virtue
and
humanity
would
be
secured
in
furtherance
of
any
plan
which
would
check
this
mighty
torrent
of
vice
and
woe
from
the
fact
that
youth
is
the
grand
desideratum
it
is
evident
that
a
constant
succession
of
young
people
will
be
driven
into
this
arena
either
by
force
or
treachery
average
duration
of
life
among
these
women
does
not
exceed
four
years
from
the
beginning
of
their
career
there
are
as
in
all
cases
exceptions
to
this
rule
but
it
is
a
tolerably
well
established
fact
that
one
fourth
of
the
total
number
of
abandoned
women
in
this
city
die
every
year
thus
by
estimating
the
prostitutes
in
new
york
at
six
thousand
and
this
is
not
an
exaggerated
calculation
as
will
be
proved
hereafter
the
appalling
number
of
one
thousand
five
hundred
erring
women
are
hurried
to
their
last
long
homes
each
year
of
our
existence
neglected
and
contemned
while
living
they
pass
from
this
world
unnoticed
and
unwept
but
their
deaths
leave
vacancies
which
must
be
supplied
the
inexorable
demands
of
vice
and
dissipation
must
be
gratified
and
who
can
tell
what
innocent
and
happy
family
circle
may
next
have
to
mourn
the
ruin
and
disgrace
of
one
of
its
members
in
a
subsequent
portion
of
this
work
it
will
be
necessary
to
notice
the
means
employed
for
ensnaring
the
innocent
and
unsuspecting
and
to
show
that
this
is
a
danger
which
threatens
all
classes
of
the

the

who
were

within
the
limits
of
the

slightly
exceeds
three
eighths
of
the
aggregate
from
whom
replies
to
these
queries
were
obtained
they
are
natives
of

and

and
may
be
subdivided
in
geographical
order
as
follows
the
eastern
district
containing
maine
new

vermont
massachusetts
connecticut
and
rhode

contributes
one

and

to

the

the
western
states
ohio
illinois
missouri
and

also
twelve
women
on
what
hypothesis
can
these
proportions
be
explained
maine
on
the
extreme
northeast
with
a
rocky
coast
fronting
on
the
wild
atlantic
with
a
harsh
cold
climate
sends
women
from
her
population
of
while
virginia
with
inhabitants
contributes
but
nine
this
difference
in
favor
of
the
southern
state
can
not
be
explained
on
the
ground
of
distance
for
the
boundaries
of
each
state
are
nearly
equidistant
from
new
york
nor
can
it
be
sustained
by
the
idea
that
maine
has
more
as
the
maritime
coast
of
the
southern
state
is
at
least
equal
to
that
of
the
northern
one
and
the
ordinary
tendencies
to
immorality
in
towns
would
be
equally
felt
in
each
the
case
is
still
farther
involved
by
the
fact
that
in
all
southern
cities
the
majority
of
prostitutes
are
from
the
north
and
it
is
a
circumstance
that
at
certain
periods
large
numbers
of
courtesans
from
new
york
boston
and
other
cities
emigrate
southward
were
the
generally
received
opinion
of
the
effects
of
a
warm
climate
upon
female
organization
to
be
adopted
in
this
connection
not
only
would
there
be
no
necessity
for
this
exodus
but
the
number
of
prostitutes
received
from
virginia
should
largely
exceed
those
from
maine
this
fact
is
sufficient
to
confirm
the
idea
already
expressed
that
fraud
or
force
is
used
to
entrap
these
females
the
natives
of
a
bleak
northern
state
are
far
more
likely
to
be
deceived
by
the
artful
misrepresentations
of
emissaries
from
new
york
than
the
denizens
of
the
southern
portion
of
our
union
the
former
lead
a
life
of
comparative
hardship
the
latter
one
of
comparative
ease
in
maine
over
six
thousand
women
or
one
in
every
of
the
female
population
are
immured
for
six
days
in
every
week
in
a
crowded
factory
in
virginia
over
three
thousand
women
or
one
in
every
one
hundred
and
of
the
female
population
are
similarly
employed
this
mode
of
life
will
form
a
matter
for
subsequent
consideration
so
far
as
its
tendencies
to
immorality
are
concerned
again
place
in
contrast
rhode
island
with
eighteen
women
living
by
prostitution
in
new
york
and
a
population
of
only
and
maryland
with
fifteen
prostitutes
in
new
york
and
a
population
of
and
a
more
palpable
difference
in
favor
of
the
southern
state
is
apparent
the
former
sends
one
prostitute
out
of
every
eight
thousand
of
her
inhabitants
the
latter
one
out
of
every
thousand
calculating
on
the
basis
of
the
respective
populations
vermont
and
new
hampshire
have
nearly
the
same
proportion
as
maine
massachusetts
exceeds
the
average
and
connecticut
the
land
of
steady
habits
has
a
still
larger
excess
new
jersey
has
the
largest
proportion
of
any
state
in
the
union
and
pennsylvania
shows
about
the
average
of
maine
the
southern
and
western
states
have
but
few
representatives
new
york
the
home
state
will
be
noticed
in
due
course
the
preceding
facts
will
supply
materials
for
reflection
in
conjunction
with
the
question
on
what
hypothesis
can
these
proportions
be
explained
the
answer
to
this
query
would
seem
to
be
that
the
excess
from
the
eastern
and
middle
states
arises
from
the
employment
of
a
much
larger
proportion
of
females
in
manufacturing
and
sedentary
occupations
a
young
woman
of
ardent
temperament
can
not
but
feel
the
hardship
of
this
position
in
life
as
compared
with
her
more
favored
sisters
in
other
states
and
when
such
an
idea
has
once
obtained
possession
of
her
mind
it
forms
a
subject
for
constant
thought
thus
when
already
predisposed
in
favor
of
any
change
she
falls
into
the
hands
of
the
tempter
a
pliant
victim
beyond
the
hardship
attendant
on
her
daily
labor
the
associations
which
are
formed
in
factories
or
workshops
where
both
sexes
are
employed
very
frequently
result
disastrously
for
the
female
notwithstanding
all
the
care
which
may
be
taken
on
the
part
of
employers
and
it
is
a
subject
for
national
pride
that
american
manufacturers
are
doing
far
more
to
elevate
the
moral
character
of
their
employés
than
the
same
class
of
men
in
other
lands
it
is
morally
impossible
that
these
intimacies
can
be
entirely
suppressed
nor
can
their
ruinous
effects
be
prevented
study
the
moral
statistics
of
any
of
the
manufacturing
towns
in
great
britain
or
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
the
same
results
are
presented
but
in
a
more
alarming
degree
because
there
the
supervision
is
not
only
weak
in
itself
but
is
frequently
intrusted
to
improper
persons
whose
interest
is
often
in
direct
opposition
to
their
duty
a
few
words
in
respect
to
the
state
of
new
york
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
proportion
to
the
population
far
exceeds
the
ratio
from
any
other
state
new
beyond
the
effect
of
manufactures
which
operate
here
to
a
corresponding
extent
as
in
other
states
the
immense
maritime
business
of
new
york
city
and
the
constant
flood
of
immigrants
and
strangers
passing
through
it
must
be
taken
into
consideration
this
constantly
fills
some
localities
with
sailors
men
proverbial
for
having
in
every
port
a
wife
and
many
of
whom
are
notorious
frequenters
of
houses
of
prostitution
this
circumstance
proves
that
this
infernal
traffic
is
governed
by
the
same
rules
which
regulate
commercial
transactions
namely
that
the
supply
is
in
proportion
to
the
demand
if
by
any
miracle
all
the
seamen
and
strangers
visiting
new
york
could
be
transformed
into
moral
men
at
least
from
one
half
to
two
thirds
of
the
houses
of
ill
fame
would
be
absolutely
bankrupt
the
constant
flood
of
immigration
leaves
a
mass
of
behind
it
consisting
in
the
first
place
of
men
idle
and
vicious
in
their
own
lands
who
transfer
their
vices
to
the
country
of
their
adoption
and
for
a
time
after
arrival
here
devote
what
means
they
possess
to
the
pursuit
of
debauchery
and
materially
help
to
swell
the
torrent
of
immorality
another
class
of
immigrants
are
women
many
of
whom
are
sent
here
by
charitable
associations
or
public
bodies
in
foreign
lands
as
the
most
economical
way
to
get
rid
of
them
many
of
these
females
become
mothers
almost
as
soon
as
they
land
on
these
shores
in
fact
the
probability
of
such
an
event
sometimes
hastens
their
departure
they
exist
here
in
the
most
squalid
misery
in
some
tenement
house
or
hovel
their
children
receive
none
of
the
advantages
of
education
for
as
soon
as
they
can
beg
they
are
compelled
to
aid
in
the
struggle
for
bread
and
the
most
frequent
result
is
that
the
boys
are
arrested
for
some
petty
theft
and
the
girls
become
prostitutes
thus
contributing
to
meet
the
demand
caused
by
the
classes
already
mentioned
but
in
addition
to
these
foreign
children
born
by
accident
in
our
state
the
proportion
of
prostitutes
from
new
york
is
increased
by
the
facility
offered
for
transit
from
the
interior
to
the
city
doubtless
there
are
many
courtesans
from
the
eastern
and
southern
districts
who
find
their
way
to
some
of
the
large
cities
in
their
own
part
of
the
country
and
so
on
the
same
principle
when
a
woman
in
this
state
has
fallen
into
vicious
habits
her
natural
resort
is
to
this
metropolis
in
addition
to
the
more
extended
market
it
offers
for
her
charms
its
advantages
as
a
great
central
rendezvous
for
the
nation
must
not
be
overlooked
here
a
prostitute
can
live
until
her
attractions
wane
and
hence
she
can
easily
reach
any
southern
or
other
point
where
abandoned
women
are
in
demand
despite
of
the
large
number
of
prostitutes
ascertained
to
have
been
born
within
the
bounds
of
new
york
state
it
can
not
be
conceded
that
we
are
any
less
moral
than
our
neighbors
in
other
parts
of
the
confederation
it
is
a
matter
for
the
most
serious
consideration
to
be
followed
by
sound
and
judicious
action
either
legislative
or
personal
that
so
large
a
number
of
american
girls
fall
victims
to
this
fell
destroyer
in
a
land
where
a
good
education
is
within
the
reach
of
every
one
where
industry
if
properly
applied
in
the
right
channels
will
afford
a
comfortable
maintenance
for
all
where
the
natural
resources
are
sufficient
to
support
nearly
half
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
were
you
born
abroad
if
so
in
what
country

england

ireland

prussia
saxony
scotland
switzerland
wales
west
indies
at
sea
total
born
abroad
it
has
been
frequently
remarked
and
as
generally
believed
in
the
absence
of
any
satisfactory
information
on
the
subject
that
a
very
large
majority
of
the
prostitutes
in
new
york
are
of
foreign
birth
but
the
facts
already
developed
with
the
few
remarks
which
will
be
made
upon
the
above
table
of
nativities
go
far
toward
falsifying
that
opinion
the
enumeration
shows
that
five
eighths
only
were
born
abroad
the
dominions
of
great
britain
furnishing
the
largest
proportion
the
ratio
in
which
the
several
parts
of
that
kingdom
supply
the
new
world
with
courtesans
may
be
stated
in
round
numbers
as
follows
ireland
contributes
one
prostitute
to
every
four
thousand
of
her
population
british
north
america
one
prostitute
to
every
seven
thousand
of
population
scotland
one
prostitute
to
every
sixteen
thousand
of
population
england
and
wales
one
prostitute
to
every
fifty
thousand
of
population
of
course
this
will
be
understood
as
referring
to
all
prostitutes
now
living
in
this
city
assuming
the
average
nativities
of
all
to
be
fairly
represented
in
the
replies
obtained
from
a
portion
but
these
numbers
being
based
upon
the
population
of
the
several
countries
give
but
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
the
extent
of
vice
among
that
portion
of
their
people
who
have
settled
in
america
and
a
more
satisfactory
comparison
can
be
drawn
from
the
records
of
emigration
upon
an
examination
of
the
arrivals
in
each
year
from
the
time
the
existing
board
of
commissioners
of
emigration
was
organized
to
the
end
of
a
period
of
ten
years
it
is
found
that
the
numbers
average
two
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
per
annum
which
gives
a
proportion
of
one
prostitute
to
every
two
hundred
and
fifty
emigrants
this
is
based
upon
the
theory
that
one
fourth
of
the
abandoned
women
die
or
are
otherwise
removed
from
the
city
every
year
to
repeat
this
fact
in
plainer
words
of
every
two
hundred
and
fifty
emigrants
men
women
and
children
who
land
at
our
docks
at
least
one
woman
eventually
becomes
known
as
a
prostitute
this
demoralization
may
be
accounted
for
in
several
ways
there
is
frequently
a
protracted
interval
between
the
time
when
families
arrive
at
the
intended
port
of
departure
and
the
day
on
which
they
sail
and
during
this
space
they
are
exposed
to
all
the
malign
influences
invariably
existing
in
large
towns
which
must
impart
vicious
ideas
to
young
people
who
have
recently
left
some
secluded
part
of
the
country
take
liverpool
for
instance
the
port
whence
the
largest
number
of
emigrants
come
to
us
and
which
contains
one
prostitute
for
every
inhabitants
and
the
wonder
will
be
not
that
so
many
are
contaminated
but
that
so
many
escape
when
the
dangers
of
the
town
are
surmounted
another
source
of
immorality
is
found
in
the
steerage
passage
across
the
atlantic
this
occupies
from
one
to
three
months
during
which
time
the
females
are
necessarily
in
constant
communication
with
the
other
sex
and
frequently
exposed
to
scenes
of
indelicacy
too
glaring
to
be
described
here
and
this
in
addition
to
the
constant
machinations
of
the
abandoned
and
unprincipled
men
who
are
to
be
found
in
greater
or
less
numbers
in
every
ship
complement
of
crew
and
passengers
under
such
circumstances
the
germ
implanted
in
the
town
often
develops
into
its
legitimate
fruit
but
when
the
ship
has
reached
her
haven
and
the
perils
of
the
sea
are
passed
there
are
dangers
to
be
encountered
on
land
the
present
arrangements
for
disembarking
emigrants
at
castle
garden
have
removed
many
of
the
most
objectionable
features
formerly
incident
to
their
entry
into
the
land
of
their
adoption
yet
there
are
many
still
remaining
if
a
family
desire
to
travel
to
the
interior
of
the
country
they
can
do
so
at
once
but
should
they
remain
in
the
city
they
are
exposed
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
emigrant
keepers
generally
themselves
natives
of
the
old
country
who
having
been
swindled
on
their
arrival
are
both
competent
and
willing
to
practice
the
same
impositions
on
others
it
must
not
be
concluded
that
all
who
follow
the
business
are
worthy
of
this
sweeping
condemnation
many
of
them
are
undoubtedly
honest
yet
it
can
not
be
denied
that
others
do
pursue
this
nefarious
course
and
when
they
have
drained
all
the
resources
of
their
customers
they
turn
them
adrift
to
beg
or
starve
or
sin
for
a
subsistence
to
one
or
the
other
of
these
causes
many
girls
owe
their
ruin
indeed
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
a
majority
of
the
prostitutes
of
foreign
birth
are
more
or
less
influenced
thereby
in
addition
to
these
there
are
other
snares
constantly
set
for
strangers
to
which
we
shall
hereafter
allude
it
is
scarcely
within
the
province
of
this
section
to
notice
measures
calculated
to
remove
the
evils
named
with
the
first
the
american
people
have
no
possible
means
of
interfering
with
regard
to
the
second
many
difficulties
must
be
encountered
and
overcome
the
commissioners
of
emigration
have
taken
steps
to
avert
some
of
the
evils
and
in
consequence
of
their
application
to
the
present
congress
a
bill
has
been
introduced
making
it
a
penal
offense
for
any
officer
or
sailor
on
emigrant
ships
to
have
carnal
intercourse
with
any
passenger
whether
with
or
without
her
consent
the
third
evil
named
is
a
local
question
peculiarly
and
entirely
under
our
own
control
and
at
the
risk
of
anticipating
the
subject
it
may
be
suggested
that
the
most
effectual
way
of
obviating
it
would
be
the
organization
of
a
plan
offering
inducements
and
facilities
for
young
women
to
leave
the
city
thus
removing
them
from
its
baneful
influences
to
a
part
of
the
country
where
their
own
labor
would
give
them
the
means
of
a
comfortable
subsistence
and
a
virtuous
life
it
is
but
poor
policy
to
retain
in
new
york
numbers
of
persons
who
can
by
no
possibility
procure
employment
in
an
already
overcrowded
field
of
labor
and
who
must
eventually
consent
to
earn
a
precarious
living
by
the
sacrifice
of
virtue
it
matters
not
through
what
agency
their
ruin
is
effected
whether
by
the
oppression
of
a
keeper
the
intrigues
of
an
or
the
wiles
of
abandoned
ones
of
their
own
sex
the
degradation
is
an
indisputable
fact
and
the
expenses
to
every
citizen
from
the
extra
cost
of
police
supervision
courts
of
justice
hospitals
and
penitentiaries
would
probably
be
enough
to
remove
many
from
the
city
who
are
debauched
for
the
want
of
opportunity
to
leave
it
would
be
far
better
to
try
the
system
of
prevention
in
the
first
instance
and
this
would
probably
be
successful
in
many
cases
whereas
any
reformatory
plan
is
almost
useless
where
the
rubicon
has
been
passed
how
long
have
you
resided
in
the
united
states
length
of
residence
numbers
under
months
year
years
years
and
upward
from
birth
unascertained
total
in
intimate
connection
with
the
subject
of
the
nativities
of
prostitutes
now
in
new
york
are
the
answers
to
the
above
inquiry
deducting
the
number
of
women
it
will
be
found
that
five
hundred
and
or
more
than
per
cent
of
the
foreigners
have
resided
in
the
united
states
less
than
five
years
and
of
this
number
one
hundred
and
fifteen
or
nearly
per
have
resided
here
less
than
one
year
these
averages
support
to
some
extent
the
opinion
already
advanced
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
prostitutes
in
new
york
city
were
either
seduced
previous
to
leaving
their
port
of
departure
or
on
their
passage
or
very
soon
after
their
arrival
here
when
they
commenced
forthwith
a
practice
which
forces
them
eventually
to
become
a
burden
upon
the
community
in
a
majority
of
cases
this
must
be
the
result
of
their
career
the
successive
fall
from
one
gradation
of
their
wretched
life
to
a
lower
finally
landing
them
in
the
prisons
or
hospitals
of
a
city
toward
whose
expenses
neither
their
pecuniary
ability
nor
their
labor
have
ever
contributed
a
farthing
their
support
thus
falls
upon
the
working
population
an
argument
of
dollars
and
cents
which
will
not
be
without
its
influence
in
a
consideration
of
the
numerous
evils
of
prostitution
the
remaining
per
having
been
in
the
united
states
more
than
five
years
are
by
law
entitled
to
receive
any
assistance
which
their
necessities
may
demand
from
local
funds
but
of
this
number
there
are
some
who
have
doubtless
been
chargeable
to
public
institutions
before
they
had
completed
the
required
term
of
residence
as
there
are
unquestionably
many
who
in
order
to
procure
relief
make
false
representations
as
to
the
time
of
their
arrival
reasoning
from
facts
there
can
be
little
exaggeration
in
the
estimate
that
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
per
annum
is
the
amount
which
the
citizens
of
new
york
contribute
to
the
support
of
foreigners
who
have
been
less
than
five
years
in
the
united
states
nor
can
this
be
prevented
unless
the
claims
of
suffering
humanity
are
entirely
ignored
of
course
the
idea
that
a
sick
or
disabled
man
or
woman
is
to
be
left
to
perish
can
not
be
entertained
for
one
moment
if
they
are
in
want
or
in
pain
every
dictate
of
our
common
nature
demands
that
they
shall
be
relieved
but
it
may
be
suggested
to
those
interested
in
the
question
of
local
taxation
to
give
their
prompt
assistance
to
any
practicable
scheme
which
will
diminish
the
amount
of
vice
and
consequently
reduce
the
expenses
resulting
therefrom
such
as
a
plan
for
shielding
emigrants
from
corrupting
influences
and
forwarding
the
destitute
to
sections
where
labor
may
be
obtained
upon
the
moral
effects
of
such
an
arrangement
it
is
unnecessary
to
remark
as
they
are
of
its
successful
working
and
eventual
economy
but
little
doubt
can
be
entertained
how

have

these
tables
require
no
comment
the
attention
of
the
reader
may
merely
be
called
to
the
fact
that
three
hundred
and
women
have
been
already
reported
as
born
in
the
state
of
new
york
of
which
number
three
hundred
and
have
resided
within
its
limits
continuously
from
the
time
of
their
birth
and
that
one
hundred
and
or
nearly
one
half
were
natives
of
new
york
city
and
have
resided
therein
from
the
day
they
were
born
this
fact
alone
demonstrates
that
the
influences
of
metropolitan
life
are
not
very
favorable
to
the
advance
of
female
morality
what
induced

emigrate

already
in

states
no
special
cause
assigned
total
of
foreigners
this
table
shows
that
a
majority
of
the
prostitutes
of
foreign
birth
were
induced
to
emigrate
to
the
united
states
either
by
considerations
of
policy
four
hundred
and
eleven
assigning
as
their
reason
a
desire
to
improve
their
condition
in
life
or
from
family
connections
six
hundred
and
nineteen
having
arrived
with
relatives
and
friends
or
with
the
purpose
of
joining
relatives
and
friends
already
in
this
country
it
will
not
be
denied
by
any
one
familiar
with
the
subject
that
one
main
reason
for
emigration
is
always
found
in
the
comparative
difficulty
of
earning
a
livelihood
in
the
place
of
the
emigrant
nativity
and
the
expectation
of
doing
better
in
a
strange
land
a
conclusion
sustained
by
the
fact
that
a
prosperous
year
in
europe
serves
to
check
the
arrivals
here
and
with
the
difficult
problem
of
labor
and
remuneration
in
the
old
world
it
would
be
out
of
place
to
interfere
but
it
may
be
remarked
that
badly
as
many
branches
of
female
employment
are
paid
for
with
us
they
are
still
worse
paid
for
in
england
reference
to
a
previous
chapter
treating
of
the
causes
of
prostitution
in
that
country
will
at
once
establish
this
point
and
the
instances
therein
quoted
of
the
wages
paid
in
london
will
remove
all
surprise
that
this
country
should
be
a
receptacle
for
underpaid
operatives
or
that
the
hope
of
realizing
better
wages
should
be
sufficiently
powerful
to
sever
all
ties
of
and
home
but
many
of
these
impoverished
women
were
actually
dependent
upon
friends
for
the
payment
of
their
and
consequently
arrived
here
almost
literally
penniless
with
very
slight
prospects
of
obtaining
work
and
frequently
with
but
one
alternative
and
the
only
one
they
had
before
coming
here
which
they
must
embrace
or
starve
another
class
assign
as
a
reason
for
expatriation
the
ill
usage
of
parents
in
itself
a
prolific
cause
of
prostitution
under
any
circumstances
but
more
especially
when
its
effects
have
been
to
drive
the
girl
a
distance
of
four
thousand
miles
from
home
from
an
examination
of
these
causes
alone
it
is
apparent
that
however
well
qualified
physically
and
morally
to
add
their
quota
to
the
prosperity
of
the
united
states
had
their
exertions
been
properly
directed
yet
the
circumstances
under
which
these
women
emigrated
were
so
embarrassing
as
to
render
them
easy
victims
to
those
whose
special
business
seems
to
be
to
ensnare
the
friendless
and
unfortunate
this
branch
of
inquiry
may
be
continued
by
a
reference
to
the
following
table
giving
a
summary
of
answers
to
the
did
you
receive
any
assistance
and
if
so
to
what
amount
to
enable
you
to
emigrate
to

united
states
amount
of
assistance

their
own

specified
rec
assistance
each
totals
total
of
prostitutes
it
appears
that
only
two
hundred
and
or
about
one
fifth
of
the
total
number
paid
their
own
the
remainder
having
received
pecuniary
assistance
toward
that
object
ranging
from
an
unspecified
amount
which
in
all
probability
was
not
more
than
the
positive
expenses
of
the
voyage
to
six
hundred
dollars
it
will
be
observed
that
the
majority
did
not
receive
more
than
forty
dollars
each
eight
hundred
and
of
those
assisted
stating
that
such
help
did
not
exceed
that
sum
this
certainly
was
but
a
very
inadequate
amount
to
pay
the
expenses
of
an
outfit
and
a
voyage
across
the
atlantic
and
then
to
support
a
person
in
a
strange
land
until
employment
could
be
secured
particularly
if
she
was
but
one
of
a
family
each
member
of
which
had
the
same
imperative
necessity
for
work
as
herself
these
remarks
may
be
thought
inconsistent
with
the
statements
published
in
of
the
amount
of
money
brought
to
this
country
by
immigrants
but
it
may
be
suggested
that
although
these
reports
gave
a
correct
statement
of
the
sum
in
the
possession
of
all
the
passengers
by
a
certain
vessel
they
are
altogether
silent
as
to
the
numbers
who
were
destitute
they
merely
proved
what
has
been
universally
conceded
within
the
last
three
or
four
years
namely
that
among
the
immigrants
arriving
are
many
with
considerable
cash
means
but
it
does
not
require
much
reflection
to
convince
any
one
that
when
a
family
bring
available
funds
with
them
they
will
leave
new
york
as
quickly
as
possible
in
search
of
some
locality
where
their
money
may
be
advantageously
employed
this
is
still
more
likely
as
the
fact
of
their
being
possessed
of
capital
proves
them
to
have
practiced
habits
of
industry
and
economy
at
home
which
would
scarcely
abandon
them
when
they
reached
the
new
world
the
aggregated
facts
as
to
property
do
not
touch
isolated
cases
of
poverty
the
most
dangerous
to
this
community
because
individuals
who
are
forced
to
remain
in
the
city
from
want
of
means
to
leave
it
not
only
swell
its
long
list
of
paupers
but
are
in
circumstances
which
may
materially
influence
them
to
become
prostitutes
and
have
the
spur
of
necessity
to
urge
them
forward
in
this
or
any
other
course
which
may
offer
a
respite
from
starvation
the
following
table
corroborates
this
theory
it
consists
of
replies
to
the
other
part
of
the
same
did
you
receive
any
assistance
and
if
so
from
whom
to
enable
you
to
emigrate
to
the
united
states
by
whom
assisted
numbers

their
own
expenses
by
relatives
or
friends
by
money
remitted
by
relatives
or
friends
in
the
stole
money

their
friends
by
seducers
by
public
authorities
totals
total
of
prostitutes
as
a
general
rule
the
parties
by
whom
assistance
was
rendered
were
not
likely
to
advance
any
amount
beyond
what
was
absolutely
required
even
this
amount
would
perhaps
be
reduced
before
the
termination
of
the
voyage
if
it
should
prove
a
protracted
one
and
the
provisions
of
the
passengers
be
exhausted
as
there
are
on
board
every
ship
persons
who
are
willing
to
sell
articles
of
food
at
prices
ranging
from
three
to
six
times
their
value
and
who
are
equally
ready
to
supply
demands
for
brandy
or
tobacco
also
on
a
review
of
the
responses
given
to
the
three
questions
which
have
been
under
consideration
in
this
section
it
appears
that
the
opinions
expressed
are
legitimate
deductions
from
the
premises
they
may
be
thus
recapitulated
the
majority
of
those
immigrants
who
subsequently
become
prostitutes
in
new
york
were
almost
destitute
in
their
own
country
they
arrive
here
with
little
or
no
means
of
support
their
poverty
renders
them
peculiarly
liable
to
yield
to
temptation
if
indeed
many
of
them
have
not
previously
fallen
thus
if
we
do
not
receive
them
as
prostitutes
when
they
reach
our
shores
we
receive
them
in
a
condition
immediately
to
become
such

the
sake
of
subsistence

you
read
and
write

of

total
seven
hundred
and
fourteen
of
the
women
who
were
examined
in
new
york
city
say
that
they
can
read
and
write
this
must
not
be
regarded
as
proof
that
they
have
received
a
superior
or
even
a
medium
education
but
is
a
phrase
which
may
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
they
can
read
a
page
of
printed
matter
without
much
trouble
and
can
sign
their
names
although
truth
compels
the
admission
that
their
writing
is
very
often
a
species
of
penmanship
extremely
difficult
to
decipher
beyond
such
acquirements
as
these
very
few
scarcely
one
in
each
five
hundred
have
progressed
five
hundred
and
can
read
and
write
a
grade
of
education
which
may
be
defined
as
midway
between
the
amount
of
knowledge
already
described
and
a
state
of
total
ignorance
enough
in
fact
to
relieve
them
from
the
suspicion
of
being
altogether
illiterate
which
is
the
sole
advantage
they
can
claim
over
the
two
hundred
and
nineteen
who
can
or
the
five
hundred
and
who
confess
that
they
neither
read
nor
as
a
whole
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
prostitutes
in
new
york
believe
where
ignorance
is
bliss
is
folly
to
be
wise
these
remarks
are
made
from
observations
upon
this
class
during
a
long
hospital
experience
but
seriously
such
a
state
of
ignorance
is
most
deplorable
to
give
an
idea
of
the
facilities
for
acquiring
education
in
the
various
countries
from
which
these
prostitutes
reach
us
the
following
statement
from
the
united
states
census
for
is
submitted
the
ratio
of
persons
receiving

is
as

the
following
is
a
fair
average
estimate
of
the
acquirements
of
native
and
prostitutes
degree
of
education
natives
foreigners
can
read
and
write
well
per
cent
per
imperfectly
uneducated
the
average
of
educational
facilities
in
the
united
states
is
as
one
to
five
in
european
countries
it
is
one
to
ten
in
other
words
every
one
in
this
country
has
twice
the
opportunities
for
education
compared
with
those
born
in
the
old
world
opportunities
which
in
the
cases
of
these
women
at
least
have
not
been
improved
to
their
full
extent
of
those
who
claim
to
be
well
educated
the
united
states
show
more
than
the
average
in
the
class
imperfectly
educated
foreigners
show
one
half
of
their
number
and
the
superior
advantages
in
this
country
only
produce
exactly
the
same
proportion
the
proportion
of
those
uneducated
is
not
much
more
favorable
in
natives
than
in
foreigners
some
allowances
must
be
made
however
in
this
calculation
for
the
fact
that
many
children
of
foreign
birth
arrive
here
at
an
early
age
and
gain
such
education
as
they
possess
in
american
institutions
but
even
this
will
but
slightly
affect
the
disproportion
alluded
to
but
no
possible
modification
of
the
facts
can
be
conceived
sufficient
to
excuse
the
negligence
of
the
parents
or
friends
of
one
fourth
of
the
prostitutes
in
this
city
at
the
present
day
when
education
may
be
obtained
literally
without
money
and
without
price
sectarian
bigotry
must
be
held
responsible
for
much
of
this
offense
if
our
children
can
not
be
educated
as
we
please
they
shall
not
be
educated
at
all
if
they
must
not
read
the
books
we
wish
they
shall
never
learn
the
alphabet
is
in
effect
if
not
in
words
the
language
of
thousands
in
this
country
what
are
the
results
of
this
cruel
policy
the
children
go
forth
into
the
world
the
boys
to
earn
a
precarious
living
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
the
girls
condemned
to
the
most
servile
work
in
any
family
where
their
stupidity
may
find
a
shelter
until
they
meet
with
some
man
of
their
own
mental
calibre
whom
they
marry
and
forthwith
bring
up
their
unfortunate
children
in
the
same
manner
in
which
they
themselves
were
reared
this
is
the
brightest
view
of
the
future
of
ignorant
children
the
darker
shades
are
depicted
in
the
annals
of
vice
and
crime
may
be
seen
daily
in
our
prisons
hospitals
and
pauper
the
picture
is
not
overdrawn
nor
will
the
reply
so
common
in
this
generation
these
are
the
children
of
foreigners
serve
to
exonerate
the
parents
for
even
if
all
the
uneducated
native
women
who
have
answered
these
questions
were
born
of
foreign
parentage
a
fact
which
must
be
proved
before
it
is
admitted
but
which
we
are
not
inclined
to
concede
yet
they
were
born
on
our
soil
where
public
schools
were
open
to
receive
them
and
their
intelligence
would
enhance
the
credit
of
the
land
in
the
same
proportion
that
their
ignorance
diminishes
it
a
love
of
their
adopted
country
its
institutions
and
its
fame
is
not
too
much
to
ask
of
parents
who
derive
their
maintenance
from
its
resources
it
is
a
libel
upon
the
parental
instinct
it
can
not
be
called
feeling
to
allow
any
child
in
the
united
states
to
arrive
at
years
of
maturity
without
acquiring
a
good
plain
solid
education
fathers
or
mothers
who
pursue
such
a
course
as
this
would
consider
themselves
unjustly
accused
if
told
they
were
training
their
daughters
to
become
prostitutes
but
such
is
the
fact
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
imagine
any
thing
so
likely
to
lead
a
woman
from
the
paths
of
rectitude
as
ignorance
coupled
with
the
conviction
that
such
ignorance
is
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
her
progress
in
life
it
drives
her
to
intoxication
to
drown
her
reflections
and
from
intoxication
to
prostitution
the
transition
is
easy
and
almost
certain
here
then
are
a
number
of
young
women
thrown
into
society
every
year
without
the
least
education
untrained
for
good
and
only
fit
for
evil
ignorant
of
their
duties
to
themselves
or
to
the
world
with
sensibilities
callous
because
they
have
never
been
cultivated
with
faculties
on
a
level
with
the
inferior
animals
from
the
same
cause
they
are
expected
to
succeed
in
life
it
would
be
as
consistent
to
take
a
man
who
had
never
seen
a
and
give
him
the
control
of
a
locomotive
and
a
train
of
cars
without
anticipating
an
accident
as
it
is
to
presume
in
this
day
of
knowledge
that
an
uneducated
man
or
woman
can
ever
become
a
respectable
and
useful
member
of
society
could
our
liberal
facilities
for
education
be
duly
improved
much
would
be
done
to
prevent
the
vice
of
prostitution
no
classical
or
extraordinary
tuition
is
required
to
accomplish
this
end
merely
common
sense
rightly
cultivated
and
conscience
enlightened
and
developed
so
as
to
appreciate
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
will
do
much
to
aid
a
woman
to
pass
unscathed
through
trials
which
constantly
ruin
the
ignorant
the
question
has
sometimes
arisen
whether
it
should
not
be
made
compulsory
on
parents
to
educate
their
children
the
present
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
that
subject
but
the
following
statistics
will
show
to
what
extent
the
duty
is
neglected
the
united
states
census
for
reports
population
of
new
york

no
returns
are
made
of
the
numbers
attending

and
these
must
be
sought
from
other
sources
the
report
of
the
board
of
education
for
states
the
average
daily
attendance
at
the
ward
or
public
schools
to
be
the
same
document
gives
data
from
which
the
attendance
at
religious
corporate
or
other
public
schools
can
be
calculated
but
says
nothing
of
private
schools
an
approximate
estimate
of
the
latter
can
however
be
made
with
the
help
of
the
united
states
census
in
the
proportions
were
about
one
private
to
every
twelve
public
scholars
and
since
that
period
there
has
probably
been
but
little
change
in
the
ratio
from
these
facts
the
subjoined
may
be
assumed
a
reasonably
correct
statement
average
attendance
at
public
schools
allowance
of
twenty
per
cent
for
absentees
whose
names
are
on
the
school
registers
but
who
attend
irregularly
corporate
schools
receiving
state
assistance
without
estimated
private
schools
total
children
attending
school
this
would
give
a
school
attendance
of
per
cent
of
the
population
between
the
ages
of
five
and
fifteen
years
or
ten
per
cent
less
than
in
that
the
proportionate
numbers
receiving
education
are
diminishing
is
susceptible
of
proof
from
one
fact
in
the
pupils
in
the
public
schools
were
more
than
in
during
the
last
fifteen
years
the
population
of
the
city
has
increased
more
than
twenty
thousand
per
annum
and
of
this
increase
about
one
fifth
or
four
thousand
are
between
the
ages
of
five
and
fifteen
it
follows
that
in
there
were
four
thousand
additional
children
in
new
york
as
compared
with
but
there
were
only
additional
attendants
at
the
public
schools
admitting
that
other
schools
received
the
same
increase
of
pupils
an
admission
more
liberal
than
facts
would
warrant
the
education
of
seven
hundred
only
would
be
provided
for
leaving
three
thousand
three
hundred
destitute
of
instruction
in
the
course
of
the
year
the
attention
of
the
board
of
education
was
directed
to
the
large
number
of
children
not
attending
any
school
and
upon
the
basis
of
a
partial
census
of
the
city
they
were
assumed
to
amount
to
sixty
thousand
this
was
conceded
to
be
an
the
figures
given
above
would
make
the
number
which
may
very
likely
be
nearer
the
truth
but
even
this
may
be
in
excess
and
to
allow
for
all
possible
contingencies
we
will
place
it
at
thirty
thousand
even
this
is
an
alarming
statement
the
suggestion
that
of
all
the
children
in
our
city
nearly
per
cent
are
growing
up
in
a
state
of
perfect
ignorance
presents
so
many
frightful
considerations
that
the
mind
revolts
at
the
bare
possibility
but
the
facts
will
not
permit
any
other
construction
if
this
criminal
neglect
be
continued
it
must
produce
fatal
consequences
to
society
and
the
view
of
impending
results
would
almost
sanction
a
compulsory
education
are
you

condition
numbers
single

total
the
civil
condition
of
the
prostitutes
in
new
york
city
furnishes
matter
of
serious
consideration
in
view
of
the
slight
restraints
which
the
ordinarily
received
rules
of
society
place
upon
the
passions
and
the
utter
inefficiency
of
such
regulations
to
counteract
the
influences
tending
to
female
degradation
influences
in
fact
which
they
very
frequently
augment
rather
than
check
in
the
cases
of
many
females
now
under
notice
marriage
was
invested
not
only
with
the
sanctions
of
a
civil
contract
between
the
parties
as
recognized
by
our
state
laws
but
according
to
the
tenets
of
the
roman
catholic
church
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
seven
holy
sacraments
which
it
is
deemed
an
act
of
sacrilege
to
violate
yet
in
the
face
of
these
ordinances
the
civil
contract
is
broken
the
sacrament
is
profaned
in
one
fourth
of
the
total
number
of
cases
or
four
hundred
and
ninety
out
of
two
thousand
which
are
now
under
notice
it
would
be
out
of
place
to
enter
here
on
any
disquisition
respecting
the
duties
of
the
married
state
regarded
in
its
abuses
as
provocative
of
prostitution
it
is
noticed
hereafter
enjoined
by
the
precepts
of
holy
writ
supported
by
the
sentiment
of
the
world
and
respected
by
all
virtuous
men
marriage
is
an
institution
which
needs
no
argument
to
enforce
its
claims
to
the
most
rigid
observance
that
this
sacred
compact
is
too
frequently
violated
by
one
or
other
of
the
contracting
parties
is
proved
by
almost
daily
experience
either
in
courts
of
law
or
by
intercourse
with
the
world
conflicting
testimony
sometimes
renders
it
doubtful
to
whom
the
blame
ought
to
be
imputed
but
there
can
be
no
uncertainty
whatever
as
to
the
opinions
entertained
by
society
at
large
in
such
cases
if
the
husband
has
been
guilty
of
a
breach
of
his
conjugal
duties
he
reads
the
whole
of
the
evidence
graphically
reported
with
occasional
embellishments
in
the
columns
of
the
daily
papers
flatters
himself
that
he
is
acquiring
notoriety
is
congratulated
by
friends
of
his
own
predilections
on
his
success
and
in
a
short
time
is
fully
reinstated
in
his
former
social
position
on
the
contrary
if
the
weight
of
evidence
is
against
the
wife
the
whole
artillery
of
the
scorn
is
leveled
at
her
head
she
is
driven
from
society
crushed
by
the
proudly
virtuous
frowns
of
her
own
sex
and
the
contemptuous
sneers
of
the
other
dishonored
and
despised
she
is
too
often
left
with
no
means
of
existence
but
indiscriminate
prostitution
the
temptation
to
such
degradation
being
aggravated
by
the
consciousness
of
her
previous
infidelity
and
its
results
there
is
no
possibility
of
salvation
for
her
the
moral
world
has
resolved
she
shall
not
repent
and
the
least
attempt
on
her
part
to
atone
for
an
error
over
which
she
mourns
with
all
the
intensity
of
her
nature
is
sternly
resisted
by
the
virtuous
indignation
of
society
which
erects
an
impassable
barrier
between
herself
and
her
hopes
of
reformation
of
the
prostitutes
in
new
york
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixteen
have
never
been
married
their
sin
is
the
less
because
they
have
not
to
answer
for
broken
vows
nor
have
they
any
outraged
confidence
on
which
to
brood
but
to
endure
only
the
sin
and
odium
attached
to
their
present
condition
two
hundred
and
prostitutes
are
widowed
in
their
cases
death
has
put
an
end
to
the
marital
contract
and
thus
left
free
to
act
for
themselves
they
stand
in
nearly
the
same
condition
as
single
women
an
investigation
of
the
nativities
of
these
women
shows
that
about
one
third
each
of
the
single
and
married
prostitutes
are
natives
of
the
united
states
and
of
widows
about
one
half
were
born
in
this
country
the
question
may
arise
as
to
the
causes
to
be
assigned
for
the
depravity
of
married
women
and
for
the
large
proportion
of
widows
in
the
ranks
of
the
abandoned
it
would
certainly
appear
that
one
of
the
principal
if
not
principal
cause
which
can
be
specified
is
the
very
early
age
at
which
such
marriages
are
contracted
young
people
yield
to
the
impulse
of
a
moment
acknowledge
the
charms
of
a
person
they
meet
in
a
or
public
assembly
and
are
married
with
a
very
imperfect
knowledge
of
each
other
character
with
but
little
reflection
on
the
probable
result
of
the
alliance
and
with
but
a
slight
appreciation
of
the
obligations
they
are
contracting
it
was
a
wise
regulation
whether
regarded
physically
or
morally
which
fixed
the
earliest
period
of
marriage
in
ancient
germany
at
years
and
declared
the
union
invalid
if
the
parties
had
not
reached
that
time
of
life
nor
would
the
morality
of
new
york
suffer
if
a
similar
restriction
was
the
rule
instead
of
the
exception
here
the
annexed
cases
selected
at
random
from
the
replies
received
are
submitted
in
support
of
this
opinion
now
nineteen
years
of
age
is
a
married
woman
who
has
been
separated
from
her
husband
five
years
and
must
therefore
have
been
married
when
less
than
fourteen
years
old
now
years
of
age
has
been
a
widow
for
five
years
and
was
married
at
fifteen
was
married
at
sixteen
and
at
fifteen
now
years
old
has
been
a
widow
more
than
twelve
years
aged
has
been
a
widow
seven
years
both
these
women
were
under
sixteen
when
married
the
list
might
be
extended
almost
indefinitely
the
following
inquiry
as
a
continuation
of
the
same
branch
of
the
subject
is
embodied
in
this
section
if
married
is
your
husband
living
with
you
or
what
caused
the
separation
causes
numbers
living
together
of

desertion
of
to

with
other
women
intemperance
husbands
went
to
sea
refused
to
support
them
infidelity
no
cause
assigned
totals
aggregate
of
married
women
the
most
striking
and
painful
fact
in
these
answers
is
revealed
in
the
first
line
of
the
table
which
contains
an
announcement
so
disgraceful
to
humanity
that
but
for
the
positive
evidence
adduced
by
the
figures
it
would
be
scarcely
credited
namely
that
of
four
hundred
and
ninety
married
women
now
living
as
prostitutes
more
than
one
seventh
are
cohabiting
with
their
husbands
it
can
not
be
controverted
that
such
cohabitation
necessarily
implies
a
knowledge
of
the
degradation
and
a
participation
in
the
wages
of
her
shame
nor
will
any
argument
however
plausible
succeed
in
removing
from
the
public
mind
the
conviction
that
the
man
is
far
the
more
guilty
party
of
the
two
and
he
can
not
escape
the
suspicion
that
he
was
the
primary
agent
in
leading
his
wife
to
prostitution
or
in
legal
parlance
he
was
an
accessory
before
the
fact
while
such
a
consideration
will
not
exonerate
the
woman
from
her
offenses
it
may
be
justly
pleaded
in
extenuation
although
it
will
not
prove
her
guiltless
it
will
sink
him
to
the
lowest
depths
of
disgrace
the
conduct
of
husbands
is
alleged
in
a
majority
of
the
cases
as
the
cause
of
separation
two
hundred
and
out
of
four
hundred
and
nineteen
women
give
the
following
causes
husbands
refused
to
support
their
wives
deserted
their
wives
to
live
with
other
women
of
husbands
total
the
cases
wherein
intemperance
infidelity
or
no
cause
assigned
were
replied
are
vague
and
may
be
construed
to
attach
blame
to
either
or
both
sufficient
has
been
proved
to
show
that
in
many
cases
prostitution
among
married
women
is
the
result
of
circumstances
which
must
have
exercised
a
very
powerful
influence
over
them
the
refusal
of
a
husband
to
support
his
wife
his
desertion
of
her
or
an
act
of
adultery
with
another
woman
are
each
occurrences
which
must
operate
injuriously
upon
the
mind
of
any
female
and
by
the
keen
torture
such
outrages
inflict
on
the
sensitiveness
of
her
nature
must
drive
her
into
a
course
of
dissipation
many
women
thus
circumstanced
have
actually
confessed
that
they
made
the
first
false
step
while
smarting
from
injuries
inflicted
by
their
natural
protectors
with
the
idea
of
being
revenged
upon
their
brutal
or
faithless
companions
for
their
unkindness
morality
will
argue
and
very
truly
that
this
is
no
excuse
for
crime
but
much
allowance
must
be
made
for
the
extreme
nature
of
the
provocation
and
the
fact
that
most
of
these
women
are
uneducated
and
have
not
sufficient
mental
or
moral
illumination
to
reason
correctly
upon
the
nature
and
consequences
of
their
voluntary
debauchery
or
even
to
curb
the
violence
of
their
passions
of
husbands
a
crime
particularly
rife
in
england
and
apparently
fast
becoming
naturalized
here
also
stands
as
a
prominent
cause
of
vice
and
is
one
which
can
not
be
too
pointedly
condemned
it
strikes
at
the
root
of
the
social
fabric
and
must
invariably
be
denounced
both
on
account
of
its
enormity
as
an
offense
and
of
its
almost
inevitable
consequences
to
the
woman
a
sense
of
degradation
too
often
followed
by
the
sacrifice
of
rectitude
as
the
only
means
to
escape
such
brutal
tyranny
without
advocating
capital
punishment
it
may
be
allowable
to
suggest
the
query
whether
our
city
would
not
be
benefited
if
all
such
unmanly
offenders
against
propriety
were
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
of
married
women
and
hanged
without
benefit
of
clergy
the
following

so
throughout
the

the

little

for

the
principal
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
it
being
that
the

of

are
driven
to
a
course
of
vice
from
the
destitution
ensuing
on

it
has
been
shown
that
a
large
number
of
them
are
very
young
and
it
can
be
scarcely
necessary
to
repeat
that
any
young
woman
in
a
state
of

will
be
surrounded
with

she
can
with
difficulty
resist

taking
the

calculating
upon

it
will
appear

or
to

the

liable
physically
to
inherit
the
diseases
of
the

morally

endure
the
disgrace
attached

very
probably
to
be

in

in

of

and
perpetuate
the

to
which
they
owe
their

the

more

the

years
is
under

of
age
from

to
total
the
population
between

ages
in

this
would
give
a
mortality
of

or
about
to
every
ten
children
under
five
years
of
age
it
is
not
exceeding
the
bounds
of
probability
to
assume
that
the
greater
part
of
the
children
of
prostitutes
die
before
they
reach
the
age
of
five
years
which
will
give
a
mortality
among
that
class
of
nearly
times
the
average

this
calculation
must
be
taken
in
connection
with
the
cases
of
abortion
produced
by
extraneous
means
not
admitted
in
the
replies
to
the
interrogatories
and
which
will
probably
never
be
known
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
that
these
are
far
more
frequent
than
recorded
in
the
tables
under
the
heads
of
premature
births
and
the
following
numbers
are
reported
years
premature

total
the
births
during
the
same
period
were

this
would
show
a
proportion
of
per
or
one
to
every
eight
of
all
the
children
born
in
new
york
city
it
is
not
to
be
taken
for
granted
that
all
these
are
the
result
of
improper
conduct
although
unquestionably
many
are
so
applying
the
same
ratio
to
the
children
of
prostitutes
and
calculating
the
births
in
these
tables
as
extending
over
a
period
of
five
years
would
give
cases
each
year
but
multiplying
the
average
by
four
the
proportion
of
deaths
from
natural
causes
we
shall
find
the
appalling
number
of
one
hundred
and
cases
each
year
an
array
of
infantile
mortality
presenting
features
which
place
it
almost
on
a
level
with
the
infanticide
of
some
eastern
nations
were
it
possible
to
form
any
definite
idea
of
the
abortions
actually
procured
and
which
are
suspected
on
reasonable
grounds
to
amount
to
a
very
considerable
number
the
amount
would
be
startling
the
sacrifice
of
infant
life
attribute
it
to
what
cause
you
may
is
one
of
the
most
deplorable
results
of
prostitution
and
urgently
demands
active
interference
the
attention
of
the
american
medical
association
has
been
drawn
to
this
subject
and
from
a
report
on
infant

in

by
meredith
reese
published
in
their

we
extract
the
causes
of
mortality
among
children
of
tender
age
are
in
a
multitude
of
cases
to
be
found
only
by
extending
our
inquiries
to
their
life
and
the
physiological
state
of
the
parents
but
especially
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
mothers
their
hygienic
and
moral
habits
and
circumstances
celibacy
should
be
required
of
all
syphilitic
persons
of
either
sex
it
will
at
once
occur
to
the
mind
of
the
reader
that
enforced
celibacy
would
not
affect
the
maternity
of
prostitutes
they
are
liable
to
give
birth
to
children
and
as
their
physiological
condition
is
such
as
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
their
children
being
healthy
the
only
way
to
check
infant
mortality
in
this
class
is
to
deal
with
the
mothers
and
adopt
means
if
not
to
prevent
their
infection
at
least
to
limit
the
ravages
of
disease
as
much
as
possible
this
point
is
discussed
more
fully
in
the
chapter
on
remedial
measures
to
men
tainted
with
syphilis
the
same
course
of
reasoning
would
apply
if
debarred
from
marriage
the
sexual
appetite
would
drive
them
to
commerce
with
prostitutes

their
illegitimate
children
swell
the
total
of
mortality
the
health
of

be
protected

this

it

it
may
be
remarked
as
was
done
in
considering
the
question
of

that
they
are
with
scarcely
a
solitary
exception
those
who
having

engaged
in
and
are
thus
exempted
from
many
dangers
attending
the

of
a

if
the

rule
had
been
observed
here
in

cases
as
was
done
in
the
inquiries
at

namely
to
exclude
them
from
the
list

the
relative

given

would
have
shown
still
more

it
may
be
asked
what
peculiar
dangers
attend
the
life
of
a

in
this

there
is
a
frightful
physical
malady
to
which
all
are
liable

which
will
be
alluded
to
under
its
proper
head
there
are
other
dangers
to
which
prostitutes
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
are
exposed
it
is
not
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
that
at
intervals
the
public
is
shocked
by
accounts
in
our
daily
papers
of
cowardly
and
outrageous
assaults
upon
these
unfortunate
women
perpetrated
by
ruffians
of
the
other
sex
sometimes
it
is
an
onslaught
made
by
a
party
of
men
for
little
or
no
provocation
on
a
number
of
females
or
it
may
be
an
attack
of
a
paramour

to
this

description
of

almost
every
one

brutal
control

in
many
cases
singular
as
it
may
appear
an
actual
love
is
felt
by
the
woman
for
her
man
in
others
it
is
a
mere
arrangement
for
mutual
convenience
the
man
taking
her
part
in
all
quarrels
and
the
woman
providing
funds
to
maintain
him
in
idleness
the
intemperate
habits
of
the
prostitutes
also
tend
materially
to
shorten
their

in

physical
dangers
must
be
considered
the
mental
anguish
they
undergo

a

are
the
subjects
of
thought
indulged
by
many
who
would
never

be
a
needless
repetition
to
dwell
upon
them
here
it
is
sufficient
for
the
present
purpose
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
more
than
two
fifths
of
the
total
number
of
prostitutes
examined
during
the
investigation
confess
that
they
have
suffered
from
syphilis
or
gonorrhoea
the
probability
is
that
the
real
number
far
exceeds
this
average
that
alarming
as
is
the
confession
the
actual
facts
are
much
worse
this
opinion
is
based
upon
the
results
of
professional
experience
and
a
knowledge
of
the
difficulty
which
exists
in
obtaining
any
voluntary
reliable
statement
on
the
subject
even
assuming
that
the
answers
obtained
are
correct
they
indicate
ample
cause
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
disease
and
its
introduction
into
almost
every
branch
of
society
one
half
of
the
total
number
who
confess
that
they
have
suffered
or
are
suffering
from
this
disease
state
that
they
have
been
so
afflicted
once
only
in
other
forms
of
sickness
which
admit
of
a
perfect
cure
this
would
be
no
cause
for
alarm
but
in
this
instance
it
is
a
mooted
point
among
medical
writers
whether
the
syphilitic
taint
can
ever
be
eradicated
from
the
system
where
it
has
been
implanted
and
the
arguments
on
each
side
are
urged
with
great
ability
without
presuming
to
pass
an
opinion
on
the
question
or
expressing
any
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
those
learned
men
who
think
it
possible
to
remove
the
taint
from
the
body
it
is
policy
to
urge
in
this
case
the
views
of
their
opponents
that
it
can
not
be
eradicated
upon
this
ground
every
citizen
is
competent
to
determine
for
himself
the
amount
of
public
mischief
resulting
daily
from
a
mass
of
prostitutes
two
out
of
every
five
of
whom
are
diseased
what
was
the
cause
of
your
becoming
a
prostitute
causes
numbers
inclination
destitution
seduced
and
abandoned
drink
and
the
desire
to
drink
of
parents
relatives
or
husbands
as
an
easy

bad

persuaded
by
prostitutes
too
idle
to

seduced
on
board
emigrant
ships
in
emigrant
boarding
houses
total
this
question
is
probably
the
most
important
of
the
series
as
the
replies
lay
open
to
a
considerable
extent
those
hidden
springs
of
evil
which
have
hitherto
been
known
only
from
their
results
first
in
order
stands
the
reply
inclination
which
can
only
be
understood
as
meaning
a
voluntary
resort
to
prostitution
in
order
to
gratify
the
sexual
passions
five
hundred
and
thirteen
women
more
than
one
fourth
of
the
gross
number
give
this
as
their
reason
if
their
representations
were
borne
out
by
facts
it
would
make
the
task
of
grappling
with
the
vice
a
most
arduous
one
and
afford
very
slight
grounds
to
hope
for
any
amelioration
but
it
is
imagined
that
the
circumstances
which
induced
the
ruin
of
most
of
those
who
gave
the
answer
will
prove
that
if
a
positive
inclination
to
vice
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
fall
it
was
but
the
result
of
other
and
controlling
influences
in
itself
such
an
answer
would
imply
an
innate
depravity
a
want
of
true
womanly
feeling
which
is
actually
incredible
the
force
of
desire
can
neither
be
denied
nor
disputed
but
still
in
the
bosoms
of
most
females
that
force
exists
in
a
slumbering
state
until
aroused
by
some
outside
influences
no
woman
can
understand
its
power
until
some
positive
cause
of
excitement
exists
what
is
sufficient
to
awaken
the
dormant
passion
is
a
question
that
admits
innumerable
answers
acquaintance
with
the
opposite
sex
particularly
if
extended
so
far
as
to
become
a
reciprocal
affection
will
tend
to
this
so
will
the
companionship
of
females
who
have
yielded
to
its
power
and
so
will
the
excitement
of
intoxication
but
it
must
be
repeated
and
most
decidedly
that
without
these
or
some
other
equally
stimulating
cause
the
full
force
of
sexual
desire
is
seldom
known
to
a
virtuous
woman
in
the
male
sex
nature
has
provided
a
more
susceptible
organization
than
in
females
apparently
with
the
beneficent
design
of
repressing
those
evils
which
must
result
from
mutual
appetite
equally
felt
by
both
in
other
words
man
is
the
animal
so
far
as
sexual
desire
is
involved
were
it
otherwise
and
the
passions
in
both
sexes
equal
illegitimacy
and
prostitution
would
be
far
more
rife
in
our
midst
than
at
present
some
few
of
the
cases
in
which
the
reply
inclination
was
given
are
herewith
submitted
with
the
explanation
which
accompanied
each
return
while
virtuous
this
girl
had
visited
where
she
became
acquainted
with
prostitutes
who
persuaded
her
that
they
led
an
easy
merry
life
her
inclination
was
the
result
of
female
persuasion
left
her
husband
and
became
a
prostitute
willingly
in
order
to
obtain
intoxicating
liquors
which
had
been
refused
her
at
home
was
deserted
by
her
husband
because
she
drank
to
excess
and
became
a
prostitute
in
order
to
obtain
liquor
in
this
and
the
preceding
case
inclination
was
the
result
solely
of
intemperance
willingly
sacrificed
her
virtue
to
a
man
she
loved
her
inclination
was
swayed
by
the
advice
of
women
already
on
the
town
continued
this
course
from
inclination
after
having
been
seduced
by
her
lover
this
girl
inclination
arose
from
a
love
of
liquor
enough
has
been
quoted
to
prove
that
in
many
of
the
cases
what
is
called
willing
prostitution
is
the
sequel
of
some
communication
or
circumstances
which
undermine
the
principles
of
virtue
and
arouse
the
latent
passions
destitution
is
assigned
as
a
reason
in
five
hundred
and
cases
in
many
of
these
it
is
unquestionably
true
that
positive
actual
want
the
apparent
and
dreaded
approach
of
starvation
was
the
real
cause
of
degradation
the
following
instances
of
this
imperative
necessity
will
appeal
to
the
understanding
and
the
heart
more
forcibly
than
any
arguments
that
could
be
used
as
in
all
the
selections
already
made
or
that
may
be
made
hereafter
these
cases
are
taken
indiscriminately
from
the
replies
received
and
might
be
indefinitely
extended
during
the
progress
of
this
investigation
in
one
of
the
lower
wards
of
the
city
attention
was
drawn
to
a
pale
but
girl
about
seventeen
years
of
age
from
whose
replies
the
following
narrative
is
condensed
retaining
her
own
words
as
nearly
as
possible
i
have
been
leading
this
life
from
about
the
middle
of
last
january
it
was
absolute
want
that
drove
me
to
it
my
sister
who
was
about
three
years
older
than
i
am
lived
with
me
she
was
deformed
and
a
cripple
from
a
fall
she
had
while
a
child
and
could
not
do
any
hard
work
she
could
do
a
little
sewing
and
when
we
both
were
able
to
get
work
we
could
just
make
a
living
when
the
heavy
came
our
work
stopped
and
we
were
in
want
of
food
and
coals
one
very
cold
morning
just
after
i
had
been
to
the
store
the
landlord
agent
called
for
some
rent
we
owed
and
told
us
that
if
we
could
not
pay
it
we
should
have
to
move
the
agent
was
a
kind
man
and
gave
us
a
little
money
to
buy
some
coals
we
did
not
know
what
we
were
to
do
and
were
both
crying
about
it
when
the
woman
who
keeps
this
house
where
she
was
then
living
came
in
and
brought
some
sewing
for
us
to
do
that
day
she
said
that
she
had
been
recommended
to
us
by
a
woman
who
lived
in
the
same
house
but
i
found
out
since
that
she
had
watched
me
and
only
said
this
for
an
excuse
when
the
work
was
done
i
brought
it
home
here
i
had
heard
of
such
places
before
but
had
never
been
inside
one
i
was
very
cold
and
she
made
me
sit
down
by
the
fire
and
began
to
talk
to
me
saying
how
much
better
off
i
should
be
if
i
would
come
and
live
with
her
i
told
her
i
could
not
leave
my
sister
who
was
the
only
relation
i
had
and
could
not
help
herself
but
she
said
i
should
be
able
to
help
my
sister
and
that
she
would
find
some
light
sewing
for
her
to
do
so
that
she
should
not
want
she
talked
a
good
deal
more
and
i
felt
inclined
to
do
as
she
wanted
me
but
then
i
thought
how
wicked
it
would
be
and
at
last
i
told
her
i
would
think
about
it
when
i
got
home
and
saw
my
sister
so
sick
as
she
was
and
wanting
many
little
things
that
we
had
no
money
to
buy
and
no
friends
to
help
us
to
my
heart
almost
broke
however
i
said
nothing
to
her
then
i
laid
awake
all
night
thinking
and
in
the
morning
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
here
i
told
her
what
i
was
going
to
do
and
she
begged
me
not
but
my
mind
was
made
up
she
said
it
would
be
sin
and
i
told
her
that
i
should
have
to
answer
for
that
and
that
i
was
forced
to
do
it
because
there
was
no
other
way
to
keep
myself
and
help
her
and
i
knew
she
could
not
work
much
for
herself
and
i
was
sure
she
would
not
live
a
day
if
we
were
turned
into
the
streets
she
tried
all
she
could
to
persuade
me
not
but
i
was
determined
and
so
i
came
here
i
hated
the
thoughts
of
such
a
life
and
my
only
reason
for
coming
was
that
i
might
help
her
i
thought
that
if
i
had
been
alone
i
would
sooner
have
starved
but
i
could
not
bear
to
see
her
suffering
she
only
lived
a
few
weeks
after
i
came
here
i
broke
her
heart
i
do
not
like
the
life
i
would
do
almost
any
thing
to
get
out
of
it
but
now
that
i
have
done
i
can
not
get
any
one
to
give
me
work
and
i
must
stop
here
unless
i
wish
to
be
starved
to
death
this
plain
and
affecting
narrative
needs
no
comment
it
reveals
the
history
of
many
an
unfortunate
woman
in
this
city
and
while
it
must
appeal
to
every
sensitive
heart
it
argues
most
forcibly
for
some
intervention
in
such
cases
the
following
statements
of
other
women
who
have
suffered
and
fallen
in
a
similar
manner
will
show
that
the
preceding
is
not
an
isolated
case
a
widow
with
one
child
earned
per
week
as
a
tailoress
a
servant
was
taken
sick
while
in
a
situation
spent
all
her
money
and
could
get
no
employment
when
she
recovered
quoting
her
own
words
had
no
work
no
money
and
no
home
a
widow
with
three
children
could
earn
two
dollars
weekly
at
but
could
not
obtain
steady
employment
even
at
those
prices
had
been
out
of
place
for
some
time
and
had
no
money
earned
from
two
to
three
dollars
per
week
as
tailoress
but
had
been
out
of
employment
for
some
time
the
examining
officer
reports
in
this
case
this
girl
a
tailoress
is
a
stranger
without
any
relations
she
received
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
week
which
would
not
maintain
her
a
servant
was
receiving
five
dollars
a
month
she
sent
all
her
earnings
to
her
mother
and
soon
after
lost
her
situation
when
she
had
no
means
to
support
herself
also
a
servant
received
dollar
a
month
a
landed
in
baltimore
from
germany
and
was
robbed
of
all
her
money
the
very
day
she
reached
the
shore
a
earned
one
dollar
a
week
the
captain
of
police
in
the
district
where
this
woman
resides
says
this
girl
struggled
hard
with
the
world
before
she
became
a
prostitute
sleeping
in
at
night
and
living
on
bread
and
water
during
the
day
he
adds
in
my
experience
of
three
years
i
have
known
fifty
whose
history
would
be
similar
to
hers
and
who
are
now
prostitutes
these
details
give
some
insight
into
the
of
city
life
the
most
prominent
fact
is
that
a
large
number
of
females
both
operatives
and
domestics
earn
so
small
wages
that
a
temporary
cessation
of
their
business
or
being
a
short
time
out
of
a
situation
is
sufficient
to
reduce
them
to
absolute
distress
provident
habits
are
useless
in
their
cases
for
much
as
they
may
feel
the
necessity
have
nothing
to
and
the
very
day
that
they
encounter
a
reverse
sees
them
penniless
the
struggle
a
virtuous
girl
will
wage
against
fate
in
such
circumstances
may
be
conceived
it
is
a
literal
battle
for
life
and
in
the
result
life
is
too
often
preserved
only
by
the
sacrifice
of
virtue
seduced
and
abandoned
two
hundred
and
women
make
this
reply
these
numbers
give
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
actual
total
that
should
be
recorded
under
the
designation
as
many
who
are
included
in
other
classes
should
doubtless
have
been
returned
in
this
it
has
already
been
shown
that
under
the
answer
inclination
are
comprised
the
responses
of
many
who
were
the
victims
of
seduction
before
such
inclination
existed
and
there
can
be
no
question
that
among
those
who
assign
drink
and
the
desire
to
drink
as
the
cause
of
their
becoming
prostitutes
may
be
found
many
whose
first
departure
from
the
rules
of
sobriety
was
actuated
by
a
desire
to
drive
from
their
memories
all
recollections
of
their
falsehoods
of
the
number
who
were
persuaded
by
women
themselves
already
fallen
to
become
public
courtesans
it
is
but
reasonable
to
conclude
that
many
had
previously
yielded
their
honor
to
some
lover
under
false
protestations
of
attachment
and
fidelity
it
is
needless
to
resort
to
argument
to
prove
that
seduction
is
a
vast
social
wrong
involving
in
its
consequences
not
only
the
entire
loss
of
female
character
but
also
totally
destroying
the
consciousness
of
integrity
on
the
part
of
the
male
sex
it
matters
not
under
what
circumstances
the
crime
may
be
perpetrated
none
can
be
found
that
will
exonerate
the
active
offender
from
the
imputation
of
fraud
and
treachery
a
woman
heart
longs
for
a
reciprocal
affection
and
to
insure
this
she
will
occasionally
yield
her
honor
to
her
lover
importunities
but
only
when
her
attachment
has
become
so
concentrated
upon
its
object
as
to
invest
him
with
every
attribute
of
perfection
to
find
in
every
word
he
utters
and
every
action
he
performs
but
some
token
of
his
devotion
to
her
love
is
then
literally
a
passion
an
idolatry
and
its
power
is
universally
acknowledged
but
this
passion
can
not
be
the
growth
of
an
hour
its
developments
are
gradual
from
the
first
stage
of
mere
acquaintance
it
ripens
progressively
under
the
influence
of
tender
words
and
solemn
vows
frequently
sincere
but
often
simulated
until
the
woman
owns
to
herself
and
admits
to
her
lover
that
she
regards
him
with
affection
such
an
acknowledgment
virtually
placing
her
future
life
in
his
custody
should
inspire
him
with
the
high
resolve
to
protect
her
name
and
fame
to
justify
the
confidence
she
has
reposed
but
not
unfrequently
is
it
made
the
medium
for
dishonorable
exactions
and
for
a
momentary
gratification
valueless
to
him
except
as
a
proof
of
her
fervent
adoration
and
fatal
in
its
consequences
to
her
he
tramples
on
the
priceless
jewel
of
her
honor
confidingly
surrendered
to
this
love
and
truth
it
should
be
remembered
that
in
order
to
accomplish
this
base
end
he
must
have
resorted
to
base
means
must
either
have
professed
a
love
he
did
not
feel
or
have
allowed
his
affection
to
cool
as
he
approached
its
consummation
pure
and
sincere
attachment
would
effectually
prevent
the
lover
from
performing
any
act
which
could
possibly
compromise
the
woman
he
adores
none
but
an
unmitigated
ruffian
can
calmly
and
deliberately
wrong
an
unsuspecting
female
who
has
acknowledged
a
tender
sentiment
toward
him
thus
placing
herself
so
entirely
in
his
power
the
crime
of
seduction
can
be
viewed
only
as
a
mean
and
atrocious
perjury
and
strangely
callous
must
he
be
whose
conscience
in
after
life
does
not
pursue
him
with
scorpion
stings
and
fiery
tortures
but
how
account
for
the
participation
of
the
female
in
the
crime
simply
by
viewing
it
as
an
idolatry
of
devotion
which
is
willing
to
surrender
all
to
the
demands
of
him
she
worships
to
the
intensity
of
her
affections
which
absorbs
all
other
considerations
to
a
perfect
insanity
of
love
excited
and
sustained
by
a
supposed
equal
devotion
to
herself
as
soon
as
this
conviction
of
a
mutual
love
possesses
her
mind
as
soon
as
her
heart
responds
to
its
magic
touch
she
lives
in
a
new
atmosphere
her
individuality
is
lost
her
thoughts
revert
only
to
her
lover
devoted
to
the
promotion
of
his
happiness
she
thinks
not
of
her
own
and
only
when
it
is
too
late
does
she
awake
from
the
spell
that
lures
her
to
destruction
in
such
a
case
as
this
a
woman
does
not
merit
the
contempt
with
which
her
conduct
is
visited
she
has
sinned
from
weakness
not
from
vice
she
has
been
made
the
victim
of
her
own
unbounded
love
her
richest
and
purest
affections
moralists
say
that
all
human
passions
should
be
held
in
check
by
reason
and
virtue
and
none
can
deny
the
truthfulness
of
the
assertion
but
while
they
apply
the
sentiment
to
the
weaker
party
who
is
the
sufferer
would
it
not
be
advisable
to
recommend
the
same
restraining
influences
to
him
who
is
the
inflictor
no
woman
possessed
of
the
smallest
share
of
decency
or
the
slightest
appreciation
of
virtue
would
voluntarily
surrender
herself
without
some
powerful
motive
not
in
herself
but
imparted
by
her
destroyer
well
aware
of
the
world
opinion
she
would
not
recklessly
defy
it
and
precipitate
herself
into
an
abyss
of
degradation
and
shame
unless
some
overruling
influence
had
urged
her
forward
this
motive
and
this
influence
it
is
believed
may
be
uniformly
traced
to
her
weak
but
truly
feminine
dependence
upon
another
vows
naturally
unsuspicious
herself
she
can
not
believe
that
the
being
whom
she
has
almost
deified
can
be
aught
but
good
and
noble
and
trustworthy
sincere
in
her
own
professions
she
believes
there
is
equal
sincerity
in
his
protestations
willing
to
sacrifice
all
to
him
she
feels
implicitly
assured
that
he
will
protect
her
from
harm
thus
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
in
most
cases
of
seduction
female
virtue
is
trustingly
surrendered
to
the
specious
arguments
and
false
promises
of
dishonorable
men
the
experiences
of
life
are
amply
sufficient
to
justify
this
opinion
for
it
is
a
fact
that
these
specious
arguments
and
false
promises
are
continually
resorted
to
by
many
men
for
the
express
purposes
of
seduction
and
nefarious
as
these
cases
confessedly
are
still
they
form
common
incidents
in
the
lives
of
some
who
claim
to
be
what
the
world
calls
respectable
men
who
in
the
ordinary
relations
of
life
would
scruple
to
defraud
their
neighbors
of
a
dollar
do
not
hesitate
to
rob
a
confiding
woman
of
her
chastity
they
who
in
a
business
point
of
view
would
regard
obtaining
goods
under
false
pretenses
as
an
act
to
be
visited
with
all
the
severity
of
the
law
hesitate
not
to
obtain
by
even
viler
fraud
the
surrender
of
woman
virtue
to
their
fiendish
lust
is
there
no
inconsistency
in
the
social
laws
which
condemn
a
swindler
to
the
state
prison
his
and
condemn
a
woman
to
perpetual
infamy
her
undoubtedly
there
are
cases
where
the
woman
is
the
seducer
but
these
are
so
rare
as
to
be
hardly
worth
mentioning
seduction
is
a
social
wrong
its
entire
consequences
are
not
comprised
in
the
injury
inflicted
on
the
woman
or
the
sense
of
perfidy
oppressing
the
conscience
of
the
man
beyond
the
fact
that
she
is
in
the
ordinary
language
of
the
day
ruined
the
victim
has
endured
an
attack
upon
her
principles
which
must
materially
affect
her
future
life
the
world
may
not
know
of
her
transgression
and
in
consequence
public
obloquy
may
not
be
added
to
her
burden
but
she
is
too
painfully
conscious
of
her
fall
and
every
thought
of
her
lacerated
and
bleeding
heart
is
embittered
with
a
sense
of
man
wrong
and
outrage
memory
points
to
the
many
bright
passages
in
their
acquaintance
and
says
these
shone
but
to
ensnare
you
to
the
many
tokens
of
endearment
received
from
her
betrayer
and
says
these
were
but
so
many
arguments
to
effect
your
ruin
to
the
many
vows
he
breathed
and
says
these
were
but
perjury
to
the
many
smiles
with
which
she
was
greeted
and
says
these
were
but
so
many
hypocritical
devices
she
remembers
the
thrill
of
joy
with
which
her
heart
so
gayly
bounded
when
he
first
told
her
she
was
beloved
and
she
contrasts
her
ecstasy
then
with
her
agonies
now
she
remembers
with
detestation
the
caresses
he
was
wont
to
bestow
but
above
all
she
remembers
and
her
blood
boils
with
indignation
as
the
thought
is
forced
upon
her
that
by
these
means
he
has
wrought
her
shame
she
has
learned
in
the
school
of
sorrow
that
promises
of
fidelity
are
valueless
and
her
future
life
whether
spent
in
sorrow
and
repentance
for
the
past
or
in
a
wild
impetuous
career
of
subsequent
vice
will
be
indelibly
marked
with
the
remembrance
of
his
treachery
it
can
not
be
a
matter
of
surprise
that
with
this
feeling
of
injustice
and
insult
burning
at
her
heart
her
career
should
be
one
in
which
she
becomes
the
aggressor
and
man
the
victim
for
it
is
a
certain
fact
that
in
this
desire
of
revenge
upon
the
sex
for
the
falsehood
of
one
will
be
found
a
cause
of
the
increase
of
prostitution
the
probabilities
of
a
decrease
in
the
crime
of
seduction
are
very
slight
so
long
as
the
present
public
sentiment
prevails
while
the
seducer
is
allowed
to
go
unpunished
and
the
full
measure
of
retribution
is
directed
against
his
victim
while
the
offender
escapes
but
the
offended
is
condemned
unprincipled
men
ready
to
take
advantage
of
woman
trustful
nature
abound
and
they
pursue
their
diabolical
course
unmolested
legal
enactments
can
scarcely
ever
reach
them
although
sometimes
a
poor
man
without
friends
or
money
is
indicted
and
convicted
the
remedy
must
be
left
to
the
world
at
large
when
our
domestic
relations
are
such
that
a
man
known
to
be
guilty
of
this
crime
can
obtain
no
admission
into
the
family
circle
when
the
virtuous
and
respectable
members
of
the
community
agree
that
no
such
man
shall
be
welcomed
to
their
society
when
worth
and
honor
assert
their
supremacy
over
wealth
and
boldness
there
may
be
hopes
of
a
reformation
but
not
till
then
the
following
cases
will
exhibit
some
of
the
results
of
seduction
a
native
of
pennsylvania
seventeen
years
of
age
was
induced
to
run
away
from
home
with
her
lover
who
promised
to
marry
her
as
soon
as
they
reached
philadelphia
instead
of
keeping
his
word
he
deserted
her
she
was
afraid
to
go
home
and
had
no
means
of
living
except
by
prostitution
which
she
practiced
for
eight
months
in
philadelphia
and
then
came
to
new
york
to
reside
her
father
a
physician
died
when
she
was
about
ten
years
old
and
her
mother
subsequently
married
a
in
whose
house
the
girl
was
reared
and
to
the
associations
of
which
she
probably
to
some
extent
owes
her
fall
from
virtue
in
one
of
the
most
aristocratic
houses
of
prostitution
in
new
york
was
found
the
daughter
of
a
merchant
a
man
of
large
property
residing
in
one
of
the
southern
states
she
was
a
beautiful
girl
had
received
a
superior
education
spoke
several
languages
fluently
and
seemed
keenly
sensible
of
her
degradation
two
years
before
this
time
she
had
been
on
a
visit
to
some
relations
in
europe
and
on
her
return
voyage
in
one
of
her
vessels
she
was
seduced
by
the
captain
and
became
pregnant
he
solemnly
asserted
that
he
would
marry
her
as
soon
as
they
reached
their
port
but
the
ship
had
no
sooner
arrived
than
he
left
her
the
poor
girl
parents
would
not
receive
her
back
into
their
family
and
she
came
to
new
york
and
prostituted
herself
for
support
a
the
child
of
respectable
parents
in
germany
was
seduced
in
her
native
place
by
a
man
to
whom
she
was
attached
he
promised
to
marry
her
if
she
would
accompany
him
to
the
united
states
she
obtained
the
permission
and
necessary
funds
from
her
parents
and
two
days
after
they
landed
in
new
york
her
seducer
deserted
her
carrying
off
all
the
money
she
had
brought
from
home
a
sixteen
years
of
age
was
seduced
by
a
married
man
who
now
visits
her
occasionally
was
seduced
in
new
jersey
brought
to
new
york
and
deserted
among
strangers
was
seduced
by
her
employer
a
married
man
was
seduced
while
at
school
in
troy
and
was
ashamed
to
return
to
her
parents
followed
a
lover
from
england
who
had
promised
to
marry
her
when
she
arrived
in
new
york
he
seduced
and
diseased
her
and
then
she
discovered
that
he
was
a
married
man
there
is
no
necessity
to
multiply
these
cases
drink
and
the
desire
to
drink
we
will
alter
an
old
saying
and
render
it
when
a
woman
she
is
lost
it
will
be
conceded
that
the
habit
of
intoxication
in
woman
if
not
an
indication
of
the
existence
of
actual
depravity
or
vice
is
a
sure
precursor
of
it
for
drunkenness
and
debauchery
are
inseparable
companions
one
almost
invariably
following
the
other
in
some
cases
a
woman
living
in
service
becomes
a
drunkard
she
forms
acquaintances
among
the
depraved
of
her
own
sex
and
willingly
joins
their
ranks
married
women
acquire
the
habit
of
drinking
and
forsake
their
husbands
and
families
to
gratify
not
so
much
their
sexual
appetite
as
their
passion
for
liquor
young
women
are
often
persuaded
to
take
one
or
two
glasses
of
liquor
and
then
their
ruin
may
be
soon
expected
others
are
induced
to
drink
spirits
in
which
a
narcotic
has
been
infused
to
render
them
insensible
to
their
ruin
in
short
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
enumerate
the
many
temptations
which
can
be
employed
when
intoxicating
drinks
are
used
as
the
agent
of
parents
husbands
or
relatives
is
a
prolific
cause
of
prostitution
one
hundred
and
women
assigning
it
as
a
reason
for
their
fall
in
consideration
of
their
important
relations
to
society
it
may
be
well
to
inquire
what
are
the
duties
of
parents
husbands
and
relatives
in
all
countries
where
the
obligations
of
the
marriage
contract
are
recognized
one
of
its
most
stringent
requirements
is
found
in
the
necessity
to
provide
for
the
children
of
such
union
this
is
acknowledged
as
a
moral
duty
on
account
of
the
relationship
between
parents
and
children
it
is
recognized
as
a
religious
duty
because
specially
enjoined
in
holy
writ
and
it
is
regarded
as
a
civil
duty
because
the
future
welfare
of
any
community
must
depend
upon
the
training
of
its
future
citizens
as
to
the
moral
duty
what
arguments
would
be
effectual
to
prove
to
a
parent
the
necessity
of
bestowing
a
kindly
education
upon
his
child
surely
nature
itself
would
supply
all
the
necessary
reasons
the
still
small
voice
of
conscience
will
whisper
to
him
i
have
been
the
instrument
of
bringing
this
child
into
the
world
and
i
am
therefore
responsible
for
its
welfare
and
even
plain
common
sense
despised
as
it
is
since
a
certain
philosophy
has
come
into
fashion
would
say
i
am
the
father
of
a
child
and
it
is
my
interest
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
it
the
religious
duties
are
abundantly
enforced
in
the
scriptures
these
while
requiring
in
explicit
terms
the
obedience
of
children
to
their
parents
and
annexing
to
such
commandment
the
only
promise
which
the
decalogue
contains
are
equally
plain
in
specifying
the
duties
of
parents
these
points
are
acknowledged
by
all
sects
and
parties
and
commentators
or
preachers
however
much
they
may
differ
on
questions
of
theology
or
articles
of
faith
or
rules
of
church
government
are
unanimous
upon
the
extent
of
parental
obligation
the
civil
duties
are
important
for
the
reason
already
assigned
children
will
be
our
successors
in
this
arena
as
we
have
succeeded
the
patriot
fathers
who
achieved
our
independence
and
made
us
the
people
that
we
are
the
principles
enunciated
by
every
shot
fired
during
the
revolutionary
war
have
descended
to
us
but
we
are
only
trustees
for
their
safe
transmission
to
the
next
generation
and
we
shall
be
recreant
to
our
duty
false
to
the
memory
of
our
ancestors
and
traitors
to
our
country
if
we
allow
our
children
to
assume
the
responsibilities
that
will
naturally
devolve
upon
them
without
due
preparation
for
the
sacred
trust
having
thus
briefly
alluded
to
the
duties
of
parents
it
remains
to
give
some
information
as
to
the
manner
in
which
such
obligations
are
performed
selected
from
the
returns
received
in
the
progress
of
this
investigation
a
very
well
educated
girl
i
was
seduced
at
eighteen
years
of
age
and
to
leave
home
to
hide
my
disgrace
admitting
that
this
girl
had
been
led
into
an
error
the
plain
duty
of
her
parents
in
every
point
of
view
was
to
endeavor
to
reform
her
instead
of
driving
her
from
home
human
nature
in
its
most
favorable
condition
is
fallible
all
are
liable
to
error
but
as
all
hope
for
forgiveness
so
should
they
forgive
this
is
the
doctrine
of
the
sublime
prayer
taught
by
our
savior
to
his
apostles
this
is
the
duty
of
humanity
the
bruised
reed
he
will
not
break
is
a
divine
promise
from
which
poor
finite
man
might
draw
a
valuable
lesson
my
parents
wanted
me
to
marry
an
old
man
and
i
refused
i
had
a
very
unhappy
home
afterward
this
case
was
directly
in
conflict
with
the
dictates
of
nature
she
had
formed
an
attachment
for
a
man
who
would
in
all
human
probability
have
made
her
a
good
husband
and
caused
her
to
remain
a
virtuous
member
of
society
but
her
parents
wanted
her
to
marry
an
old
man
and
in
consequence
of
refusal
treated
her
with
unkindness
she
has
now
poor
girl
to
answer
for
her
sin
of
incontinence
but
who
can
tell
what
other
offenses
would
have
been
laid
to
her
charge
had
she
married
as
desired
by
her
parents
how
many
awful
deeds
recorded
in
the
annals
of
criminal
jurisprudence
have
been
produced
by
marriages
how
many
outrages
how
much
bloodshed
owe
their
origin
to
such
a
cause
parents
who
for
their
own
selfish
purposes
would
drive
a
daughter
into
a
marriage
repugnant
to
her
feelings
deserve
the
severest
condemnation
so
far
from
performing
their
duty
in
the
matter
they
are
acting
in
diametrical
opposition
to
it
my
stepmother
me
the
stepmother
in
this
case
stands
in
the
place
of
the
natural
parent
in
assuming
the
duties
she
assumes
all
the
responsibilities
of
the
relation
and
is
equally
guilty
as
if
this
girl
were
her
own
child
women
feelings
in
a
normal
state
are
generally
kind
gentle
and
forgiving
but
when
they
are
perverted
she
becomes
more
inveterate
than
man
so
it
was
in
this
instance
my
mother
me
and
drove
me
from
home
my
father
was
very
kind
but
he
died
when
i
was
seven
years
old
a
similar
case
to
the
preceding
in
the
perversion
of
feminine
feelings
coupled
with
the
melancholy
fact
that
the
girl
father
who
had
always
used
her
kindly
died
when
she
was
a
child
it
would
be
natural
to
conclude
that
all
the
affections
of
a
widow
would
concentrate
upon
her
children
but
the
reverse
of
this
is
too
frequently
found
to
be
true
and
as
soon
as
the
husband
to
whom
her
vows
were
pledged
is
laid
in
the
grave
and
the
children
are
deprived
of
his
protecting
hand
her
love
is
alienated
from
them
a
mother
duties
to
her
offspring
are
increased
by
her
husband
death
but
she
neglects
them
and
does
violence
to
the
maternal
instinct
i
support
my
mother
it
may
possibly
be
objected
that
this
case
does
not
come
within
the
scope
of
this
section
as
showing
no
positive
neglect
of
parental
duty
but
by
implication
it
is
decidedly
entitled
to
a
place
in
the
catalogue
it
is
unfortunately
for
the
sake
of
morality
but
one
of
many
similar
instances
which
have
been
encountered
and
some
of
which
will
be
noticed
in
due
course
the
conclusion
is
that
if
this
mother
had
properly
trained
her
daughter
in
early
life
she
would
not
now
have
to
endure
the
agony
arising
from
the
knowledge
that
every
morsel
of
food
she
eats
every
article
of
clothing
she
wears
is
purchased
with
the
proceeds
of
her
child
shame
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
any
position
more
disgusting
than
this
any
circumstance
more
horrible
than
that
of
a
mother
quietly
depending
for
existence
upon
the
prostitution
of
a
daughter
with
the
certainty
that
the
inevitable
result
of
such
a
vicious
course
of
life
will
drive
the
child
of
her
affection
to
a
premature
grave
and
a
dreadful
eternity
my
father
accused
me
of
being
a
prostitute
when
i
was
innocent
he
would
give
me
no
clothes
to
wear
my
mother
was
a
confirmed
drunkard
and
used
to
be
away
from
home
most
of
the
time
here
we
have
a
combination
of
horrors
scarcely
equaled
in
the
field
of
romance
the
unjust
accusations
of
the
father
and
his
conduct
in
not
supplying
his
child
with
the
actual
necessaries
of
life
joined
with
the
drunkenness
of
the
mother
present
such
an
accumulation
of
cruelty
and
vice
that
it
would
have
been
a
miracle
had
the
girl
remained
virtuous
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
no
one
will
claim
for
this
couple
the
performance
of
any
one
of
the
duties
enjoined
by
their
position
i
had
no
work
and
went
home
my
father
was
a
drunkard
and
me
and
the
rest
of
the
family
here
is
a
specimen
of
a
father
cruelty
his
daughter
is
out
of
employment
and
has
no
home
but
with
her
parents
and
he
maddened
with
liquor
abuses
her
for
flying
to
her
natural
protectors
where
was
she
to
expect
aid
and
comfort
but
from
the
authors
of
her
being
and
how
was
such
expectation
realized
she
was
forced
to
resort
to
prostitution
as
a
means
of
living
my
parents
are
rich
they
would
not
let
me
live
at
home
because
i
had
been
seduced
in
this
case
there
was
no
excuse
for
parental
unkindness
blessed
with
an
ample
supply
of
this
world
treasures
they
could
calmly
see
their
daughter
exposed
to
want
and
penury
living
in
the
enjoyment
of
opulence
themselves
they
could
doom
her
to
earn
a
miserable
subsistence
by
a
life
of
shame
satisfied
with
their
own
lot
and
complacently
surveying
the
comforts
which
surrounded
them
they
condemned
her
to
a
course
of
infamy
in
which
no
enjoyment
could
be
found
to
cheer
her
path
where
every
day
must
add
fresh
tortures
to
her
lot
every
hour
sink
her
yet
lower
in
the
social
scale
why
because
an
indiscretion
or
a
crime
call
it
which
you
please
had
made
her
a
fitting
object
for
their
kindness
because
her
own
act
had
placed
her
in
a
position
where
she
felt
her
disgrace
and
asked
their
sympathy
and
aid
to
retrace
her
steps
can
there
be
a
more
pitiable
object
than
a
woman
who
has
sacrificed
her
virtue
to
the
importunity
the
entreaties
or
the
vows
of
her
lover
when
she
reflects
upon
her
conduct
the
delirium
of
love
is
past
but
the
overwhelming
sense
of
shame
is
left
she
feels
that
a
momentary
act
has
blasted
her
future
life
she
knows
that
the
world
will
condemn
her
and
the
only
resource
she
has
is
an
appeal
to
her
parents
if
they
kindly
take
her
by
the
hand
in
all
probability
the
evil
will
extend
no
farther
and
she
may
regain
her
position
in
life
if
they
refuse
their
sympathy
they
practically
drive
her
to
a
course
of
vice
for
there
is
no
other
road
open
to
her
who
then
is
responsible
for
her
but
those
who
have
the
power
to
preserve
her
from
farther
guilt
and
shame
j
i
am
the
eldest
of
a
large
family
my
father
is
a
drunkard
and
would
not
support
his
children
i
have
supported
my
parents
brothers
and
sisters
for
the
last
five
years
this
is
an
example
of
an
outrageous
social
crime
which
can
not
be
contemplated
without
horror
the
parents
of
a
family
with
their
remaining
children
relying
for
subsistence
upon
the
aid
furnished
from
the
sinful
earnings
of
the
in
this
instance
the
economy
of
nature
is
reversed
the
filial
affection
which
leads
a
child
to
support
her
aged
and
infirm
parents
can
be
understood
and
appreciated
but
it
is
impossible
to
reprobate
too
severely
the
conduct
of
a
man
whose
own
actions
have
reduced
him
to
poverty
and
who
then
encourages
his
daughter
to
lead
a
life
of
prostitution
that
he
may
revel
on
money
produced
by
a
course
of
debauchery
which
he
was
mainly
instrumental
in
producing
a
my
lover
seduced
and
diseased
me
while
i
was
working
in
a
factory
i
went
home
and
my
parents
turned
me
out
neither
loss
of
character
nor
physical
suffering
were
sufficient
punishment
for
this
poor
girl
only
eighteen
years
of
age
nor
could
the
probability
of
a
future
moral
life
induce
her
parents
to
pardon
the
first
offense
they
had
sent
her
to
work
amid
associations
which
were
almost
certain
to
cause
her
ruin
this
of
itself
is
a
sufficient
ground
for
their
condemnation
for
they
were
in
comfortable
circumstances
and
could
not
plead
poverty
as
an
excuse
and
when
this
ruin
was
accomplished
they
added
to
their
former
crime
by
refusing
a
shelter
to
the
sufferer
these
cases
are
taken
from
actual
facts
the
words
included
in
inverted
commas
are
as
nearly
as
possible
those
used
by
the
women
when
being
questioned
as
to
the
truth
of
the
statements
we
hesitate
not
to
believe
them
to
be
substantially
correct
they
are
not
a
fiftieth
part
of
the
instances
in
which
similar
disclosures
have
been
made
but
they
are
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
argument
and
to
prove
that
the
assertions
made
in
other
places
rest
upon
a
solid
foundation
and
are
not
mere
fancies
of
the
brain
it
would
certainly
be
much
more
to
the
credit
of
society
if
their
authenticity
were
not
so
indisputable
the
foregoing
examples
strongly
suggest
and
justify
a
farther
consideration
of
the
duties
of
parents
while
these
include
the
obligation
to
furnish
a
child
with
food
and
clothing
they
do
not
stop
at
that
point
it
would
be
erroneous
indeed
for
any
father
to
imagine
he
had
fulfilled
all
the
requirements
of
his
position
when
he
gave
a
child
enough
to
eat
and
to
wear
he
would
attend
to
the
wants
of
his
cattle
in
the
same
way
but
there
is
something
more
to
be
done
in
the
case
of
his
children
he
must
so
treat
them
as
to
induce
on
their
part
a
sentiment
of
gratitude
children
are
proverbially
and
they
seem
to
have
a
natural
faculty
for
logic
so
far
as
they
themselves
are
concerned
they
can
very
soon
discriminate
whether
a
parent
is
doing
barely
just
as
much
as
the
laws
of
the
country
and
the
voice
of
public
opinion
require
or
whether
he
is
acting
toward
them
with
true
paternal
affection
in
the
former
case
they
become
selfish
and
practice
all
their
little
arts
to
obtain
as
many
advantages
that
the
law
allows
them
as
possible
without
entertaining
any
feelings
of
respect
or
affection
toward
their
parents
because
they
know
that
such
obligations
can
not
be
evaded
without
censure
in
the
latter
case
their
gratitude
and
affection
forms
a
return
for
the
kindness
bestowed
they
immediately
perceive
that
they
are
loved
and
as
a
natural
consequence
endeavor
to
manifest
love
in
return
by
acting
in
a
manner
most
pleasing
to
their
parents
by
simply
encouraging
this
sentiment
children
can
be
moulded
much
as
the
father
wishes
whereas
by
destroying
it
he
loses
one
of
the
most
effective
aids
to
his
government
there
are
so
many
different
ways
by
which
this
affection
for
children
can
be
manifested
and
they
are
all
so
simple
and
so
certainly
effective
that
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
conceive
how
any
man
or
woman
of
the
most
ordinary
intelligence
can
overlook
them
in
addition
to
providing
for
the
personal
wants
of
his
family
their
education
claims
a
large
portion
of
the
parents
care
not
only
the
mere
tuition
imparted
in
schools
but
a
careful
training
at
home
as
preliminary
to
their
conflict
with
the
world
is
required
it
is
the
instruction
and
advice
given
in
the
quiet
of
the
domestic
circle
that
exercises
the
most
powerful
influence
most
effectually
shapes
the
destiny
of
the
future
man
or
woman
no
person
is
justified
in
delaying
the
performance
of
this
duty
so
soon
as
a
child
can
talk
and
walk
so
soon
is
this
guidance
necessary
it
would
be
an
interesting
and
important
matter
of
investigation
to
ascertain
if
possible
the
time
of
life
at
which
children
become
influenced
by
the
temptations
which
surround
them
the
result
would
show
a
much
earlier
age
than
is
generally
supposed
a
boy
when
playing
with
his
companions
overhears
an
improper
expression
from
one
of
them
his
mind
retains
it
and
it
may
prove
the
germ
from
which
habits
of
profanity
subsequently
spring
a
girl
may
notice
an
improper
action
which
will
rest
upon
her
memory
and
produce
sad
fruit
hereafter
thus
the
education
of
children
for
the
ordinary
duties
of
life
can
not
be
commenced
too
soon
if
delayed
the
probabilities
are
that
when
you
attempt
to
cultivate
the
soil
in
after
years
you
will
find
it
already
choked
with
weeds
which
require
more
time
and
trouble
to
eradicate
than
would
the
inculcation
of
proper
principles
in
early
life
a
lady
remarked
upon
one
occasion
in
presence
of
an
eminent
preacher
that
she
thought
children
should
not
be
trained
to
any
religious
exercises
until
they
had
arrived
at
an
age
when
they
could
fully
understand
such
subjects
the
reply
of
the
aged
minister
is
appropriate
to
the
present
subject
he
said
madam
if
you
do
not
implant
good
doctrines
in
your
children
minds
before
that
time
the
devil
will
fill
them
with
mischievous
ones
a
somewhat
prevalent
error
in
the
training
of
children
must
not
be
passed
unnoticed
namely
excessive
rigidity
this
practice
is
common
in
many
but
unthinking
families
professing
christianity
every
thing
is
conducted
with
as
much
mathematical
precision
as
if
they
were
demonstrating
a
problem
in
euclid
such
a
system
is
open
to
very
grave
objections
from
the
numerous
cases
in
which
it
has
proved
prejudicial
to
the
child
best
interests
it
acts
precisely
like
the
spring
of
a
watch
which
you
can
retain
in
a
fixed
position
by
a
mechanical
contrivance
but
which
resumes
its
elasticity
and
power
the
moment
the
pressure
is
removed
children
minds
are
elastic
also
you
can
confine
them
within
any
circle
you
please
by
the
exercise
of
parental
authority
but
in
a
large
proportion
of
cases
the
end
sought
to
be
attained
is
surely
defeated
many
justly
blame
this
cause
for
the
mishaps
of
their
future
lives
it
presents
virtue
and
religion
in
a
repulsive
aspect
picturing
them
only
as
connected
with
asceticism
not
recognizing
the
beauty
and
happiness
which
are
their
chief
attractions
thus
is
engendered
in
the
minds
of
children
an
intuitive
dislike
for
what
they
are
taught
to
consider
as
a
bondage
it
is
not
uncommon
to
hear
men
describe
the
way
in
which
their
youthful
sabbaths
were
spent
and
attribute
to
the
irksome
monotony
of
that
discipline
their
subsequent
distaste
for
even
a
few
hours
confinement
in
church
this
strictness
like
ambition
overleaps
itself
and
extinguishes
the
spirit
it
is
designed
to
foster
the
proper
way
to
educate
children
for
lives
of
usefulness
honor
and
happiness
the
most
effective
plan
to
reach
the
desired
end
is
to
cultivate
their
affections
and
reason
instead
of
repressing
the
one
and
fettering
the
other
by
stringent
applications
of
arbitrary
rule
but
no
man
or
woman
can
educate
children
properly
unless
their
precepts
are
confirmed
by
example
talk
to
your
son
as
long
as
you
please
upon
the
advantages
of
temperance
and
then
let
him
see
you
in
a
state
of
intoxication
the
next
day
and
all
your
labor
will
be
fruitless
enlarge
in
the
presence
of
your
daughter
upon
the
value
of
integrity
and
then
allow
her
to
hear
you
utter
a
falsehood
and
she
will
contrast
the
theory
and
practice
and
conclude
that
the
former
is
worthless
parents
must
educate
themselves
before
they
can
hope
to
instruct
their
children
and
must
lead
a
life
in
conformity
with
the
principles
they
teach
if
they
expect
any
beneficial
results
from
their
endeavors
before
leaving
this
part
of
the
subject
another
matter
may
be
mentioned
namely
the
necessity
of
winning
the
confidence
of
children
their
hearts
pine
for
sympathy
if
they
are
in
trouble
encourage
them
to
reveal
their
perplexities
to
you
sigh
with
them
when
they
are
sad
and
rejoice
with
them
when
they
are
happy
a
girl
who
has
been
in
the
habit
of
imparting
all
her
childish
sorrows
to
her
mother
and
has
there
found
a
heart
which
would
beat
in
unison
with
her
own
will
not
withhold
her
confidence
as
she
grows
in
years
remember
that
children
while
a
blessing
to
their
parents
are
also
a
responsibility
you
have
the
power
to
train
them
for
good
or
evil
you
can
win
their
trust
or
inspire
them
with
distrust
you
can
make
them
useful
members
of
society
or
render
them
nuisances
to
the
community
to
you
their
destiny
is
confided
to
a
great
extent
and
from
you
will
be
required
an
account
of
the
stewardship
the
length
to
which
these
observations
have
been
extended
can
be
justified
by
the
importance
of
the
subject
and
the
conviction
that
a
more
careful
fulfillment
of
parental
duties
would
go
very
far
toward
diminishing
prostitution
every
man
must
admit
it
to
be
his
duty
to
aid
in
effecting
this
desirable
consummation
and
while
it
would
be
utopian
to
imagine
that
the
vice
can
be
eradicated
by
family
influences
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
its
extent
may
be
materially
curtailed
great
as
are
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
a
father
they
are
equaled
by
those
devolving
upon
a
husband
he
has
to
provide
for
the
welfare
of
his
wife
besides
caring
for
the
interests
of
his
children
when
he
marries
he
vows
to
remain
faithful
to
the
woman
of
his
choice
to
love
honor
and
cherish
her
so
long
as
they
both
shall
live
this
is
an
implied
oath
if
not
audibly
expressed
in
all
circumstances
and
any
violation
of
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
perjury
of
course
the
obligation
is
a
mutual
one
the
wife
is
bound
by
the
same
ties
and
in
as
stringent
a
form
as
the
husband
it
can
not
be
said
that
every
case
of
prostitution
in
a
married
woman
is
the
result
of
her
husband
misconduct
but
it
is
notorious
that
many
women
are
induced
or
compelled
by
such
misconduct
to
abandon
a
life
of
virtue
all
married
prostitutes
can
not
be
exonerated
from
the
charge
of
guilt
yet
the
facts
which
will
be
hereafter
quoted
prove
that
many
were
driven
to
a
life
of
shame
by
those
who
had
solemnly
sworn
to
protect
and
cherish
them
the
violation
of
any
known
duty
is
a
positive
crime
against
society
but
it
becomes
increased
in
magnitude
when
it
involves
more
than
one
person
in
the
offense
it
is
then
the
cause
of
a
second
transgression
and
sophistry
would
vainly
attempt
to
prove
that
the
man
who
committed
the
first
and
caused
the
commission
of
the
second
offense
was
not
morally
responsible
for
both
descending
from
generalities
it
may
be
truly
asserted
that
the
man
whose
conduct
to
his
wife
is
such
as
to
lead
her
to
vicious
practices
is
guilty
in
both
respects
here
are
some
few
cases
in
point
my
husband
deserted
me
and
four
children
i
had
no
means
to
live
in
this
case
the
husband
violated
the
law
of
god
in
forcibly
rending
the
matrimonial
bond
and
violated
the
laws
of
his
country
by
leaving
his
wife
and
children
as
burdens
on
society
for
the
former
of
these
offenses
he
must
answer
at
the
bar
of
infinite
justice
for
the
latter
he
is
liable
to
punishment
in
this
world
then
why
not
punish
him
asks
some
one
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
he
could
not
be
found
in
this
day
the
law
does
not
assume
the
latitude
claimed
by
the
spanish
inquisition
and
sentence
a
man
to
punishment
without
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
plead
his
cause
a
woman
in
a
state
of
destitution
with
four
hungry
children
looking
to
her
for
bread
has
neither
time
nor
means
to
pursue
a
delinquent
husband
her
present
necessities
require
her
immediate
attention
and
so
he
escapes
the
penalty
the
laws
have
awarded
and
can
live
although
it
may
be
with
an
uneasy
conscience
in
some
other
place
and
probably
repeat
there
the
iniquities
he
has
practiced
here
the
custom
of
deserting
wives
and
children
would
receive
a
severe
check
were
it
possible
in
every
instance
to
enforce
the
legal
provisions
respecting
abandonment
my
husband
committed
adultery
i
caught
him
with
another
woman
and
then
he
left
me
this
individual
turpitude
was
enhanced
by
his
boldness
he
seems
to
have
recklessly
defied
all
consequences
to
have
been
entirely
callous
to
any
sense
of
shame
and
when
detected
in
his
adulterous
intercourse
he
adds
desertion
to
his
offense
he
regarded
not
the
feelings
of
her
whom
in
early
life
he
had
won
to
his
side
by
vows
of
affection
he
outraged
the
laws
of
decency
and
trampled
upon
the
statutes
of
his
country
his
wife
agony
may
be
conceived
although
words
would
be
faint
to
express
it
and
the
mental
sufferings
she
must
have
endured
before
she
abandoned
herself
to
indiscriminate
prostitution
as
a
means
of
living
will
not
aggravate
her
offense
my
husband
eloped
with
another
woman
i
support
the
child
here
the
husband
was
morally
as
guilty
as
in
the
previous
case
but
without
the
disgusting
bravado
which
characterized
that
he
had
however
another
claim
which
should
have
secured
his
fidelity
namely
an
infant
child
but
this
tie
was
powerless
to
restrain
him
fascinated
by
the
charms
of
another
forgetting
all
the
rights
of
his
wife
all
the
obligations
of
paternity
and
all
the
requirements
of
morality
he
basely
abandoned
those
dependent
on
him
and
forced
the
wife
whose
virtue
he
was
bound
to
protect
into
a
career
of
vice
to
support
his
child
a
my
husband
accused
me
of
infidelity
which
was
not
true
i
only
lived
with
him
five
months
i
was
pregnant
by
him
and
after
my
child
was
born
i
went
on
the
town
to
support
it
the
first
idea
derived
from
this
statement
would
be
that
five
months
of
matrimonial
life
had
been
sufficient
to
change
this
husband
from
a
devoted
lover
to
a
revengeful
tyrant
who
would
not
scruple
to
resort
to
a
groundless
accusation
to
effect
his
purpose
in
this
short
space
of
time
he
conveniently
forgot
the
promises
he
had
made
repudiated
the
bonds
in
which
his
own
act
had
placed
him
and
to
accomplish
a
separation
from
his
wife
did
not
hesitate
to
bear
false
witness
against
her
placing
her
in
a
position
from
which
she
could
extricate
herself
only
by
performing
a
logical
impossibility
namely
by
proving
a
negative
nor
could
the
probable
destiny
of
his
unborn
child
influence
his
determination
it
mattered
not
to
him
whether
the
infant
first
saw
the
light
in
a
den
of
infamy
nor
whether
his
unkindness
killed
it
before
it
was
born
so
that
he
could
desert
his
wife
neither
did
it
make
any
difference
to
him
whether
she
starved
to
death
or
maintained
her
existence
by
the
most
loathsome
means
he
was
satiated
with
possession
and
neither
the
voice
of
nature
nor
the
dictates
of
conscience
could
arrest
his
purpose
the
result
was
precisely
what
might
have
been
expected
she
became
a
prostitute
rather
than
starve
and
let
her
child
starve
my
husband
brought
me
here
a
house
of
ill
fame
i
did
not
know
what
kind
of
a
place
it
was
he
lives
with
me
and
i
follow
prostitution
another
variety
of
unnatural
conduct
the
wife
in
this
case
was
a
very
young
woman
not
exceeding
eighteen
years
of
age
the
husband
held
a
respectable
and
employment
and
was
in
possession
of
ample
means
to
support
her
by
false
representations
he
induced
her
within
three
months
after
marriage
to
board
in
a
fashionable
house
of
prostitution
she
soon
discovered
its
character
but
eventually
succumbed
to
his
orders
and
became
guilty
he
resides
with
her
and
is
supported
by
her
what
language
can
be
used
adequately
to
denounce
such
a
piece
of
treachery
on
the
part
of
a
wretch
claiming
to
be
human
i
came
to
this
city
from
illinois
with
my
husband
when
we
got
here
he
deserted
me
i
have
two
children
dependent
on
me
this
man
brought
his
wife
from
a
distant
state
to
a
strange
city
where
she
had
no
friends
nor
relatives
to
advise
and
assist
her
and
there
abandoned
her
with
two
helpless
children
to
the
mercy
of
the
world
had
he
left
her
where
she
had
been
living
previously
it
is
possible
she
might
have
found
sufficient
friends
to
assist
her
until
she
was
able
to
support
herself
but
with
a
refinement
of
cruelty
he
transferred
her
to
a
place
where
she
was
unknown
and
then
effected
his
escape
the
entire
circumstances
favor
the
supposed
existence
of
a
determination
to
abandon
her
as
soon
as
they
arrived
in
new
york
where
he
could
act
thus
with
more
safety
than
in
her
native
place
i
was
married
when
i
was
seventeen
years
old
and
have
had
three
children
the
two
boys
are
living
now
the
girl
is
dead
my
oldest
boy
is
nearly
five
years
old
and
the
other
one
is
eighteen
months
my
husband
is
a
sailor
we
lived
very
comfortably
till
my
last
child
was
born
and
then
he
began
to
drink
very
hard
and
did
not
support
me
and
i
have
not
seen
him
or
heard
any
thing
about
him
for
six
months
after
he
left
me
i
tried
to
keep
my
children
by
washing
or
going
out
to
day
work
but
i
could
not
earn
enough
i
never
could
earn
more
than
two
or
three
dollars
a
week
when
i
had
work
which
was
not
always
my
father
and
mother
died
when
i
was
a
child
i
had
nobody
to
help
me
and
could
not
support
my
children
so
i
came
to
this
place
my
boys
are
now
living
in
the
city
and
i
support
them
with
what
i
earn
by
prostitution
it
was
only
to
keep
them
that
i
came
here
these
were
the
words
used
by
an
honest
sorrowful
looking
woman
encountered
in
the
course
of
this
investigation
in
the
fourth
police
district
of
the
city
no
reasonable
doubt
can
be
entertained
of
the
truth
of
the
story
the
manner
in
which
she
told
it
plainly
indicated
that
she
was
narrating
facts
some
inquiries
were
made
respecting
her
of
the
keeper
of
the
house
and
he
for
it
was
a
man
stated
that
he
knew
her
story
to
be
correct
he
had
at
first
employed
her
as
a
servant
because
he
wished
to
help
her
but
the
wages
he
could
pay
were
insufficient
to
support
her
children
and
she
eventually
prostituted
herself
because
she
could
earn
more
at
this
horrible
calling
and
was
thus
enabled
to
discharge
her
maternal
duty
but
at
what
a
sacrifice
was
this
obtained
in
order
to
feed
her
helpless
offspring
she
was
forced
to
yield
her
honor
to
prevent
them
suffering
from
the
pains
of
hunger
she
voluntarily
chose
to
endure
the
pangs
of
a
guilty
conscience
to
prolong
their
lives
she
periled
her
own
and
at
the
time
when
this
alternative
was
forced
upon
her
the
husband
was
lavishing
his
money
for
intoxicating
liquor
if
she
sinned
and
this
fact
can
not
be
denied
however
charity
may
view
it
it
was
the
of
his
duty
that
urged
nay
positively
forced
her
to
sin
she
must
endure
the
punishment
of
her
offenses
but
after
reading
her
simple
statement
let
casuists
decide
what
amount
of
condemnation
will
rest
upon
the
man
whose
desertion
compelled
her
to
violate
the
law
of
chastity
in
order
to
support
his
children
my
husband
had
another
wife
when
i
married
him
i
left
him
when
i
found
this
out
i
was
pregnant
by
him
and
had
no
other
way
to
live
than
by
prostitution
in
point
of
law
this
is
not
a
married
woman
the
existence
of
the
former
wife
rendering
the
second
union
invalid
but
this
is
no
excuse
for
the
man
conduct
in
fact
it
materially
aggravates
his
guilt
in
the
first
place
he
deserts
a
woman
whom
he
was
legally
bound
to
support
leaving
her
to
battle
her
way
through
life
to
resist
the
temptations
which
would
be
sure
to
assail
her
careless
whether
she
lived
or
died
and
heedless
whether
she
retained
her
character
or
sank
into
vice
and
then
with
the
greatest
goes
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
with
another
woman
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
feelings
of
the
latter
when
she
discovered
the
fraud
which
had
been
practiced
to
secure
her
hand
and
the
indignation
which
caused
her
to
leave
him
immediately
notwithstanding
her
condition
nor
will
it
require
much
stretch
of
fancy
to
picture
the
mental
suffering
she
endured
her
agony
during
the
hour
of
nature
trial
before
she
consented
to
earn
a
precarious
living
as
a
prostitute
such
cases
are
of
frequent
occurrence
and
even
the
probability
of
a
criminal
indictment
is
insufficient
to
deter
some
men
no
punishment
could
be
too
severe
for
such
offenses
even
considering
them
without
any
reference
to
this
particular
instance
because
they
pervert
one
of
our
most
solemn
contracts
and
destroy
all
confidence
in
the
security
of
the
marriage
tie
my
husband
was
a
drunkard
and
beat
me
how
much
of
misery
and
crime
is
contained
in
these
few
words
either
of
the
vices
practiced
by
this
fellow
is
enough
to
make
a
woman
wretched
the
combination
is
sufficient
to
drive
her
mad
she
would
doubtless
sit
and
ponder
during
the
long
and
weary
night
hours
when
he
was
carousing
with
his
drunken
companions
and
would
contrast
her
present
wretched
state
with
the
happiness
of
early
days
her
thoughts
would
revert
to
the
time
he
won
her
love
to
the
day
on
which
he
brought
her
to
his
home
a
bride
and
then
she
would
cast
her
eyes
around
the
room
now
robbed
of
almost
every
thing
portable
to
supply
his
insane
appetite
for
liquor
and
a
heavy
sigh
would
burst
from
her
heart
but
still
she
would
continue
her
sad
reminiscences
and
think
of
the
kindness
he
displayed
then
and
of
his
brutal
ferocity
now
would
remember
his
considerate
tenderness
and
compare
it
with
his
maniac
fury
and
then
something
would
whisper
to
her
why
do
you
endure
it
and
her
woman
nature
would
be
aroused
resistance
would
take
the
place
of
submission
and
she
would
leave
her
home
and
him
who
had
desecrated
it
and
immolate
herself
upon
the
altar
of
vice
a
victim
to
her
husband
drunkenness
and
cruelty
my
husband
left
me
because
i
was
sickly
and
could
not
do
hard
work
this
woman
husband
may
be
pictured
as
a
lazy
worthless
fellow
probably
one
who
married
not
to
secure
a
helpmate
and
a
partner
but
to
obtain
a
slave
her
health
would
not
allow
her
to
perform
as
much
drudgery
as
he
expected
the
speculation
did
not
turn
out
as
well
as
he
had
anticipated
and
he
left
her
destitute
to
starve
or
sin
as
she
thought
fit
my
husband
was
intemperate
and
turned
out
to
be
a
thief
he
was
sent
to
prison
still
another
victim
of
a
drunken
husband
but
he
carried
his
vicious
habits
to
a
point
where
the
laws
of
his
country
would
reach
him
had
he
merely
deserted
his
wife
nobody
would
have
thought
it
his
business
to
arrest
him
but
he
stole
some
person
property
and
all
the
enginery
of
the
law
was
forthwith
arrayed
against
him
in
the
one
instance
his
conduct
condemns
his
wife
to
shame
in
this
world
and
perhaps
perdition
in
the
next
and
the
public
looks
quietly
on
and
says
nothing
in
the
other
case
he
defrauds
his
neighbor
of
some
dollars
and
cents
and
the
indignant
community
demands
his
condign
punishment
what
conclusion
can
be
drawn
from
these
facts
honor
character
and
life
are
ruined
and
the
offender
escapes
money
is
stolen
and
he
is
punished
is
money
more
valuable
than
the
character
and
life
of
woman
it
requires
no
argument
to
prove
that
when
the
care
of
a
child
is
assumed
by
its
relatives
the
parental
obligations
also
devolve
upon
them
nor
can
there
be
any
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
duty
of
relations
to
assist
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
any
children
whom
death
or
other
circumstances
may
have
deprived
of
their
natural
protectors
were
not
these
principles
generally
recognized
all
large
cities
would
be
crowded
with
destitute
orphans
the
beneficial
results
often
arising
from
such
guardianships
argue
very
strongly
in
their
favor
but
still
the
imperative
duty
is
frequently
evaded
or
acknowledged
and
made
the
opportunity
for
an
exhibition
of
tyranny
which
naturally
tends
to
the
encouragement
of
vice
take
the
following
cases
in
illustration
i
support
my
aunt
in
this
case
the
duties
of
the
aunt
were
not
merely
evaded
but
she
adds
to
her
neglect
a
positive
approval
of
the
girl
abandoned
life
by
voluntarily
receiving
a
portion
of
her
earnings
what
species
of
education
she
bestowed
upon
her
niece
may
be
inferred
from
its
results
such
disclosures
are
almost
too
disgusting
to
be
criticised
my
parents
were
dead
i
came
to
this
country
with
an
uncle
and
aunt
who
me
from
the
time
i
landed
till
i
ran
away
the
death
of
her
parents
should
have
been
a
passport
to
the
affection
of
the
relatives
to
whose
charge
she
was
intrusted
but
instead
of
producing
such
an
effect
they
brought
her
to
a
strange
land
and
practiced
a
succession
of
cruelties
until
she
could
endure
them
no
longer
it
is
more
than
probable
that
this
was
a
plan
intended
to
drive
her
from
their
home
they
neither
acknowledged
their
duty
to
supply
the
places
of
the
father
and
mother
she
had
lost
nor
did
they
recognize
the
force
of
relationship
which
at
least
should
have
protected
her
from
positive
unkindness
nor
did
they
possess
any
of
those
feelings
of
sympathy
which
every
person
must
entertain
toward
an
orphan
they
could
not
have
been
unaware
of
the
probability
of
her
falling
into
bad
company
and
vicious
habits
if
she
left
their
care
but
no
regard
for
her
happiness
or
character
seems
to
have
entered
into
their
calculations
which
may
have
been
somewhat
in
this
form
she
is
an
expense
to
us
so
we
will
contrive
to
drive
her
away
if
she
can
make
her
living
honestly
so
much
the
better
if
she
turns
out
a
prostitute
that
is
her
own
concern
it
was
not
solely
own
but
it
involved
them
also
in
its
consequences
through
their
agency
in
its
accomplishment
and
morally
speaking
they
are
as
liable
for
her
ruin
as
if
they
had
actually
and
not
indirectly
caused
it
the
following
cases
closely
resemble
each
other
and
are
presented
in
conjunction
my
parents
were
dead
i
lived
with
my
uncle
who
treated
me
very
unkindly
my
parents
died
when
i
was
young
i
lived
with
an
uncle
and
aunt
who
used
me
the
deprivation
of
each
of
these
unfortunate
women
in
the
death
of
their
parents
a
loss
almost
incalculable
in
its
results
placed
them
under
the
guardianship
of
those
who
alike
neglected
their
duties
and
rendered
the
trust
a
medium
for
unkindness
to
the
orphans
it
seems
surprising
that
the
memory
of
a
deceased
brother
or
sister
can
not
secure
even
ordinary
care
for
their
children
it
can
not
be
expected
that
the
surviving
relatives
would
exhibit
the
same
amount
of
affection
as
would
have
been
shown
by
the
parents
but
disappointment
must
be
experienced
if
they
make
no
pretensions
to
kindness
the
dictates
of
nature
are
violated
when
harshness
takes
the
place
of
sympathy
and
destitution
is
considered
a
sufficient
warrant
for
deliberate
and
continuous
such
conduct
renders
a
girl
reckless
and
misanthropic
and
will
drive
her
to
seek
in
unhallowed
love
the
affection
her
guardians
have
refused
i
was
taken
by
my
to
a
house
of
prostitution
and
there
violated
it
is
not
often
such
a
case
of
barbarity
is
found
in
civilized
life
nor
indeed
in
less
polished
communities
as
this
forcible
violation
of
a
young
girl
through
the
aid
and
connivance
of
her
the
mind
recoils
with
disgust
from
the
instances
of
rape
so
frequently
occurring
but
this
case
is
so
peculiarly
aggravated
that
it
can
not
be
contemplated
without
a
feeling
of
shame
for
the
depravity
of
human
nature
in
the
one
case
the
brutal
passions
of
a
man
are
displayed
in
a
brutal
manner
in
the
other
the
same
cause
exists
to
a
similar
extent
coupled
with
the
blackest
perfidy
of
a
female
relative
to
such
a
shameless
violation
of
the
laws
of
consanguinity
such
an
outrageous
conspiracy
between
a
vile
man
and
a
monster
of
a
woman
the
sister
must
have
been
induced
to
lend
her
aid
by
some
means
best
known
to
herself
it
is
quite
impossible
to
imagine
she
possessed
a
single
spark
of
virtue
on
the
contrary
she
must
have
sunk
long
before
this
occurrence
to
the
lowest
depths
of
vice
or
she
never
would
have
been
an
instrument
in
such
an
infernal
scheme
the
consideration
she
received
is
of
course
known
only
to
the
parties
themselves
but
it
would
give
a
farther
insight
to
her
character
if
the
reader
could
be
informed
of
the
estimate
set
by
a
upon
an
orphan
virtue
the
result
of
the
outrage
is
no
doubt
exactly
what
the
criminals
anticipated
the
victim
knew
that
her
character
was
ruined
that
she
had
no
alternative
but
prostitution
and
while
the
guilty
pair
who
literally
forced
her
to
sin
can
congratulate
each
other
on
the
success
of
their
machinations
she
must
endure
the
penalty
in
a
life
of
crime
and
misery
i
was
detected
and
exposed
by
my
brother
this
girl
who
had
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
a
man
whom
she
loved
not
wisely
but
too
well
may
assign
her
subsequent
career
of
vice
to
the
conduct
of
her
brother
he
must
have
been
sadly
deficient
in
all
kindly
feeling
thus
to
parade
his
sister
dishonor
and
also
possessed
of
a
very
limited
knowledge
of
human
nature
or
a
large
amount
of
malevolence
it
can
scarcely
be
imagined
that
he
acted
from
ignorance
as
he
must
have
been
certain
that
such
an
exposure
would
most
probably
induce
his
sister
to
continue
an
intercourse
which
was
publicly
known
and
therefore
could
not
augment
her
disgrace
nor
can
it
be
conceived
that
a
malicious
desire
to
blast
her
character
governed
his
conduct
but
whatever
his
motive
the
result
was
the
same
she
was
forced
to
a
life
of
prostitution
from
which
she
might
have
been
rescued
had
kind
and
affectionate
means
been
employed
instead
of
the
cruel
and
heedless
course
which
was
adopted
my
parents
died
when
i
was
young
i
was
brought
up
by
relatives
who
went
to
california
when
i
was
sixteen
years
old
and
left
me
destitute
i
had
no
trade
there
is
no
allegation
that
this
relatives
used
her
unkindly
during
the
time
she
lived
with
them
but
they
deserted
her
in
a
helpless
condition
at
the
very
time
when
she
most
needed
their
guardianship
they
could
not
have
been
ignorant
of
the
many
temptations
to
which
a
young
woman
without
protectors
or
means
of
livelihood
is
exposed
in
new
york
and
yet
they
removed
to
a
distance
and
left
her
to
meet
these
trials
alone
a
girl
whom
they
had
reared
from
infancy
and
for
whom
they
must
have
entertained
considerable
affection
they
tamely
abandoned
to
an
almost
certain
fate
far
worse
than
death
to
say
the
least
it
was
a
most
inconsiderate
step
and
has
resulted
very
disastrously
my
husband
deserted
me
to
live
with
another
woman
my
parents
were
dead
i
went
to
my
brother
house
and
he
turned
me
out
fraternal
unkindness
farther
exemplified
an
orphan
sister
deserted
by
her
husband
asked
from
her
brother
the
shelter
of
his
roof
and
he
drove
her
from
the
house
such
conduct
would
have
been
barbarous
if
even
a
stranger
had
made
the
appeal
in
the
present
instance
it
exhibits
a
cruelty
which
can
not
be
too
severely
reprobated
my
parents
were
dead
i
was
out
of
place
i
had
no
relations
but
an
uncle
who
would
not
give
me
any
shelter
unless
i
paid
him
for
it
i
went
on
the
town
to
get
money
to
pay
for
my
lodgings
this
uncle
name
ought
to
be
handed
down
to
posterity
as
a
synonym
of
selfishness
and
as
indicating
another
manner
in
which
money
can
be
made
his
miserly
propensities
must
have
been
very
strongly
developed
when
he
refused
a
shelter
to
his
destitute
niece
unless
she
paid
for
it
it
certainly
did
not
matter
to
him
how
or
where
she
obtained
the
means
and
doubtless
his
equanimity
was
not
disturbed
when
he
ascertained
that
the
money
she
paid
him
was
the
price
of
her
shame
the
coin
was
as
bright
in
his
hand
as
useful
to
him
to
hoard
or
to
spend
as
if
it
had
been
her
honest
earning
probably
he
would
have
been
excessively
annoyed
it
is
the
characteristic
of
such
men
if
any
person
had
told
him
that
he
was
the
means
of
making
this
girl
a
prostitute
but
can
it
be
denied
that
such
was
the
fact
when
he
received
some
portion
of
the
money
earned
by
his
niece
prostitution
before
he
would
allow
her
to
sleep
in
his
house
my
sister
me
because
i
had
no
work
here
a
sister
seems
to
have
regarded
money
as
the
chief
good
the
applicant
was
out
of
employment
in
itself
enough
to
enlist
one
sympathies
she
was
in
want
which
should
have
been
an
additional
reason
for
kindness
and
yet
for
these
causes
a
sister
her
in
thus
endeavoring
to
show
the
several
duties
of
parents
husbands
and
relatives
to
those
dependent
females
who
are
liable
to
be
exposed
at
any
moment
to
temptations
leading
from
the
path
of
virtue
cases
have
been
exhibited
in
which
a
departure
from
the
universally
recognized
obligations
of
these
classes
has
added
recruits
to
the
ranks
of
prostitution
in
these
remarks
the
endeavor
has
been
to
advance
nothing
resting
on
a
theory
to
advocate
nothing
unless
supported
by
facts
or
acknowledged
by
common
sense
to
exonerate
no
one
from
blame
when
circumstances
demanded
a
censure
and
to
condemn
none
in
favor
of
whom
there
could
be
an
existing
doubt
the
recorded
extracts
giving
an
insight
beyond
the
scene
of
public
view
exhibiting
the
secret
machinery
of
the
family
circle
can
not
be
contemplated
without
a
mingled
feeling
of
sorrow
and
shame
sorrow
that
so
many
females
who
might
have
been
useful
members
of
society
have
been
forced
into
the
ranks
of
sin
and
shame
that
the
instruments
in
these
proceedings
were
those
who
should
have
exerted
every
power
to
prevent
such
a
result
cases
have
now
been
presented
to
the
reader
where
a
sorrowing
girl
has
been
denied
the
opportunity
of
repentance
and
driven
from
a
father
home
where
another
has
been
expelled
from
the
family
circle
because
she
would
not
consent
to
an
marriage
where
stepfathers
and
stepmothers
have
violated
their
duties
and
despised
the
obligations
they
had
voluntarily
assumed
where
a
has
driven
her
daughter
to
ruin
where
parents
were
living
and
reveling
upon
the
wages
of
their
children
dishonor
where
false
accusations
and
unkind
treatment
were
resorted
to
and
from
their
natural
effects
drove
a
girl
from
home
and
virtue
where
drunkenness
and
debauchery
made
home
a
hell
upon
earth
where
parents
in
affluent
circumstances
have
driven
a
child
from
their
home
where
prostitution
was
willingly
embraced
as
an
escape
from
parental
tyranny
again
instances
have
been
cited
where
husbands
have
deserted
their
wives
and
children
where
the
marital
vow
has
been
broken
in
the
most
glaring
manner
and
the
crime
followed
by
deliberate
abandonment
where
the
affections
have
been
slighted
and
her
love
relinquished
for
the
purchased
caresses
of
another
woman
where
a
charge
of
infidelity
has
been
made
against
a
wife
without
cause
where
a
husband
has
deliberately
brought
his
wife
to
a
house
of
prostitution
and
is
now
leading
an
idle
worthless
life
upon
her
earnings
where
another
husband
brought
his
wife
to
a
strange
city
in
order
to
desert
her
and
her
children
where
the
solemn
contract
of
marriage
has
been
perverted
where
a
drunken
husband
has
raised
his
hand
against
the
woman
he
had
sworn
to
protect
where
a
sickness
and
incapacity
for
labor
was
made
a
reason
for
her
desertion
where
a
man
insane
thirst
for
intoxicating
liquor
has
forced
a
woman
to
prostitution
for
a
maintenance
where
the
husband
has
been
committed
to
prison
for
theft
farther
cases
have
been
given
where
an
aunt
lives
upon
the
proceeds
of
a
niece
prostitution
where
uncles
and
aunts
have
systematically
their
orphan
relatives
where
a
procured
and
assisted
at
the
violation
of
a
child
where
a
brother
unkindness
forced
his
sister
to
continue
a
life
of
shame
where
relatives
to
whom
an
orphan
child
was
intrusted
abandoned
her
when
she
most
needed
their
care
where
a
brother
refused
an
asylum
to
a
deserted
and
suffering
sister
where
an
uncle
forced
a
girl
to
prostitute
herself
for
money
to
pay
him
for
her
lodgings
as
already
stated
these
cases
are
all
facts
collected
in
the
course
of
this
investigation
and
are
believed
to
be
substantially
correct
with
such
disclosures
as
these
can
any
one
be
surprised
at
the
continued
spread
of
prostitution
the
family
circle
is
one
of
the
sources
whence
it
emanates
so
is
the
matrimonial
bond
and
so
are
the
different
branches
of
consanguinity
when
fathers
husbands
and
relatives
thus
forget
their
duties
and
lend
their
influence
to
swell
the
tide
of
vice
it
is
no
matter
of
surprise
that
strangers
should
be
found
ready
and
eager
to
contribute
their
share
to
the
polluted
current
but
the
evil
is
not
incurable
if
public
opinion
can
be
enlisted
on
the
side
of
public
morals
and
parents
are
satisfied
by
unmistakable
demonstrations
that
the
voice
of
an
indignant
people
will
be
raised
against
them
if
practices
similar
to
those
narrated
continue
to
occur
husbands
too
must
be
convinced
that
any
infraction
of
their
marriage
vows
will
expose
them
to
popular
odium
and
if
they
have
contracted
an
hasty
alliance
the
responsibility
must
be
borne
by
themselves
the
contracts
they
voluntarily
made
must
be
fulfilled
relatives
also
must
be
warned
that
the
performance
of
their
duties
will
be
rigidly
required
there
is
no
deficiency
of
legislation
on
this
subject
all
that
is
wanted
is
determination
to
enforce
existing
laws
and
when
this
is
done
some
of
the
main
causes
of
prostitution
will
be
removed
to
resume
the
analysis
of
the
table
of
replies
women
were
persuaded
by
prostitutes
to
embrace
a
life
of
depravity
one
of
the
most
common
modes
by
which
this
end
is
accomplished
is
to
inveigle
a
girl
into
some
house
of
prostitution
as
a
servant
and
this
is
frequently
done
through
the
medium
of
an
intelligence
office
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
new
york
are
acquainted
with
the
arrangements
and
routine
of
business
in
those
offices
but
they
may
be
described
as
a
matter
of
information
to
others
imagine
a
large
room
generally
a
basement
in
some
leading
thoroughfare
upon
entering
from
the
street
you
will
observe
two
doors
marked
respectively
entrance
for
employers
and
entrance
for
servants
passing
through
the
first
you
approach
a
desk
where
the
proprietor
or
his
clerk
is
seated
with
his
register
books
before
him
you
make
known
your
wish
to
engage
a
servant
specifying
her
duties
and
the
wages
you
are
willing
to
pay
this
is
registered
with
your
name
and
address
the
fee
is
paid
and
you
are
invited
to
walk
into
the
other
department
and
ascertain
whether
any
of
the
throng
who
are
waiting
there
will
suit
your
purpose
if
successful
in
the
search
it
is
merely
necessary
to
inform
the
that
you
are
suited
and
to
take
your
servant
home
with
you
but
if
you
do
not
succeed
a
woman
will
be
sent
to
the
registered
address
and
the
will
continue
to
send
until
you
are
satisfied
servants
who
wish
to
obtain
situations
register
their
wants
and
pay
a
fee
if
there
are
no
places
likely
to
suit
them
on
the
list
of
employers
they
have
permission
to
remain
in
the
until
an
applicant
appears
in
these
may
be
found
a
crowd
of
expectants
varying
from
twenty
to
one
hundred
according
to
the
business
transacted
by
the
office
in
theory
this
arrangement
is
a
very
good
one
in
practice
it
is
frequently
abused
a
respectable
housekeeper
who
wishes
to
engage
a
servant
will
find
but
little
trouble
in
doing
so
and
any
person
wishing
to
make
the
office
a
medium
for
securing
females
for
improper
purposes
will
seldom
be
disappointed
it
is
rarely
that
the
proprietors
notice
the
arrangements
made
they
merely
act
as
brokers
and
make
known
the
wants
of
each
party
and
do
not
interfere
with
the
character
of
either
unless
it
is
so
notoriously
bad
as
to
force
them
to
notice
it
for
their
own
sake
so
long
as
the
employer
and
servant
agree
the
is
contented
the
following
facts
illustrate
the
manner
in
which
young
women
are
sometimes
entrapped
a
man
went
into
an
intelligence
office
and
represented
himself
as
a
storekeeper
residing
some
twenty
miles
from
new
york
he
wished
to
hire
a
girl
as
seamstress
and
chambermaid
who
must
go
home
with
him
the
same
afternoon
glancing
around
the
he
soon
saw
one
of
sufficiently
attractive
appearance
to
whom
he
made
the
proposition
the
wages
he
offered
were
liberal
the
work
was
described
as
light
and
the
woman
made
an
arrangement
to
accompany
him
forthwith
he
told
her
that
he
had
a
little
business
to
transact
before
he
could
leave
the
city
but
that
she
could
wait
for
him
at
his
sister
until
the
cars
were
ready
to
start
she
had
but
slight
knowledge
of
the
temptations
of
new
york
and
went
with
him
to
a
brothel
the
keeper
of
which
he
stated
to
be
his
sister
here
she
remained
for
some
hours
waiting
his
return
the
sister
expressed
her
surprise
at
his
absence
but
concluded
that
his
business
had
detained
him
and
with
apparently
a
kindly
feeling
told
the
girl
that
she
would
be
welcome
to
sleep
there
that
night
her
suspicions
were
lulled
by
the
seeming
respectability
of
the
persons
and
she
remained
in
the
course
of
the
evening
the
character
of
the
house
became
evident
and
then
the
proprietress
offered
to
engage
her
as
a
servant
solemnly
promising
that
she
should
not
be
exposed
to
any
insult
almost
a
total
stranger
in
the
city
and
destitute
of
money
she
consented
a
very
few
days
in
such
a
of
vice
was
sufficient
to
deaden
her
sense
of
right
and
wrong
and
within
a
fortnight
she
was
enrolled
as
a
prostitute
keepers
of
houses
sometimes
visit
these
offices
themselves
but
generally
some
unknown
agent
is
employed
or
at
times
one
of
the
prostitutes
is
plainly
dressed
and
sent
to
register
her
name
as
wishing
a
situation
so
as
to
be
able
to
obtain
admission
to
the
there
she
enters
into
conversation
with
the
other
women
whom
she
uses
all
the
art
she
possesses
to
induce
to
visit
her
employer
and
very
frequently
with
the
same
result
as
in
the
case
just
narrated
there
exists
among
many
prostitutes
a
fiendish
desire
to
reduce
the
virtuous
of
their
own
sex
to
a
similar
degradation
with
themselves
since
they
can
not
elevate
their
own
characters
they
strive
to
debase
those
of
others
to
accomplish
this
they
spare
neither
trouble
nor
misrepresentation
one
system
in
which
they
are
commonly
employed
may
be
noted
although
the
mode
is
similar
to
the
case
of
the
just
given
a
man
had
resolved
to
ruin
a
woman
who
placed
implicit
confidence
in
his
sincerity
and
admitted
that
she
loved
him
he
found
that
her
modesty
and
good
sense
were
proof
against
his
persuasive
powers
and
he
finally
resorted
to
stratagem
and
invited
her
to
walk
with
him
to
visit
some
relations
he
took
her
to
a
brothel
introduced
its
keeper
who
had
already
been
instructed
in
her
part
as
his
aunt
and
one
or
two
of
the
inmates
represented
her
daughters
the
deception
was
maintained
for
a
time
family
matters
were
discussed
and
refreshments
introduced
a
glass
of
drugged
wine
was
handed
to
the
victim
and
as
soon
as
its
effects
were
visible
the
villainous
deed
was
effected
such
machinations
as
this
show
that
not
only
are
many
of
these
prostitutes
dangerous
to
society
from
their
open
and
avowed
life
of
crime
but
also
from
the
influences
they
exert
to
deceive
the
honest
of
their
own
sex
allusion
has
been
already
made
to
the
numerous
dangers
which
surround
young
women
during
their
passage
to
this
country
on
crowded
emigrant
ships
or
after
their
arrival
in
the
equally
crowded
emigrant
and
it
is
needless
to
repeat
them
in
this
section
but
an
incomplete
statement
of
the
causes
of
prostitution
would
be
presented
if
the
injurious
effects
of
some
of
our
fashionable
were
suffered
to
pass
without
notice
startling
as
such
an
assertion
may
appear
it
is
no
more
strange
than
true
a
system
of
education
the
prominent
design
of
which
is
to
impart
a
knowledge
of
the
modern
accomplishments
to
the
almost
total
exclusion
of
moral
training
to
make
the
pupils
present
the
most
dazzling
appearance
in
society
regardless
of
their
real
interests
and
duties
does
in
some
cases
lead
to
unhappy
results
filial
affection
or
early
training
or
innate
virtue
enable
many
to
overcome
these
temptations
but
others
succumb
to
them
one
case
in
particular
it
is
desirable
to
record
although
several
of
a
similar
nature
were
met
with
a
girl
eighteen
years
of
age
born
in
louisiana
of
highly
respectable
parents
was
induced
to
elope
from
a
in
the
vicinity
of
new
orleans
with
a
man
who
accorded
with
her
romantic
ideal
of
a
lover
no
marriage
vows
ever
passed
between
them
she
trusted
him
as
the
heroine
of
a
modern
novel
would
have
done
and
he
deceived
her
as
all
modern
rakes
deceive
their
victims
she
lived
with
him
for
a
considerable
time
when
he
deserted
her
she
was
left
almost
destitute
she
was
afraid
to
return
to
her
parents
knowing
that
they
were
acquainted
with
the
life
she
had
been
leading
and
she
had
no
other
means
of
support
than
open
and
avowed
prostitution
these
features
of
her
history
should
present
a
warning
to
both
parents
and
daughters
of
the
dangers
attending
a
superficial
and
improper
system
of
education
of
course
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
all
schools
are
open
to
such
objections
in
the
numerous
institutions
of
the
kind
scattered
throughout
the
land
the
majority
are
worthy
of
every
confidence
instances
like
this
are
probably
exceptions
to
the
rule
but
still
what
has
been
pernicious
in
one
case
may
be
in
another
and
the
education
of
young
women
forming
as
it
does
their
character
for
life
should
be
conducted
as
far
as
possible
so
as
to
secure
their
safety
honor
and
usefulness
in
a
subsequent
chapter
this
superficial
education
will
be
farther
noticed
one
of
the
improvements
of
modern
times
is
the
introduction
of
physiology
as
a
branch
of
education
in
our
schools
yet
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
knowledge
communicated
to
youth
upon
a
subject
so
important
is
still
extremely
limited
indeed
such
is
the
present
state
of
public
opinion
that
any
or
teacher
that
should
impart
thorough
instruction
in
regard
to
all
the
organs
and
functions
of
the
human
body
would
be
considered
entirely
unfit
for
use
or
duty
notwithstanding
this
the
young
of
both
sexes
do
become
informed
upon
the
subjects
of
marriage
procreation
and
maternity
and
how
by
force
of
natural
curiosity
and
injurious
association
it
is
the
imperative
duty
of
parents
to
rightly
inform
their
children
concerning
the
things
which
they
must
inevitably
know
in
consequence
of
their
neglect
of
this
duty
both
boys
and
girls
are
left
to
find
out
all
they
can
about
the
mysteries
of
their
being
from
ignorant
servants
or
corrupt
companions
let
fathers
teach
their
sons
and
mothers
their
daughters
at
the
earliest
practicable
age
all
that
their
future
makes
it
necessary
for
them
to
know
the
information
thus
acquired
will
be
invested
with
a
sacredness
and
delicacy
entirely
wanting
when
obtained
from
unreliable
and
pernicious
sources
thus
would
many
of
the
injurious
influences
incident
to
the
present
secrecy
upon
such
subjects
be
avoided
of
the
evil
habits
and
practices
common
among
youth
physicians
are
well
cognizant
and
many
a
parent
has
had
to
mourn
their
sad
results
in
the
premature
death
or
dethroned
reason
of
children
who
with
proper
physical
training
might
have
been
their
pride
and
joy
next
to
the
responsibility
of
parents
in
this
matter
is
that
of
teachers
who
with
all
judiciousness
and
delicacy
should
supply
the
deficiencies
of
ignorant
or
incapable
parents
in
the
physiological
education
of
all
committed
to
their
care
and
here
a
word
in
regard
to
the
bad
effects
of
so
called
classical
studies
are
they
not
oftentimes
acquired
at
the
risk
of
outraged
delicacy
or
undermined
moral
principles
mythology
in
particular
introduces
our
youth
to
courtesans
who
are
described
as
goddesses
and
goddesses
who
are
but
courtesans
in
disguise
poetry
and
history
as
frequently
have
for
their
themes
the
ecstasies
of
illicit
love
as
the
innocent
joys
of
pure
affection
shall
these
branches
of
study
be
totally
ignored
by
no
means
but
let
their
harmless
flowers
and
wholesome
fruit
alone
be
culled
for
youthful
minds
to
the
utter
exclusion
of
all
poisonous
ones
however
beautiful
this
lack
of
information
has
resulted
in
another
evil
in
the
impetus
it
has
given
to
the
sale
of
obscene
books
and
prints
recent
legal
proceedings
have
checked
this
nefarious
trade
but
it
still
exists
boys
and
young
men
may
be
found
loitering
at
all
hours
round
hotels
docks
depôts
and
other
public
places
ostensibly
selling
newspapers
or
pamphlets
but
secretly
offering
vile
lecherous
publications
to
those
who
are
likely
to
be
customers
they
generally
select
young
and
inexperienced
persons
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
these
are
the
most
probable
purchasers
and
will
submit
to
the
most
extortion
and
in
the
second
they
can
be
more
easily
imposed
upon
the
venders
have
a
trick
which
they
frequently
perform
and
which
can
scarcely
be
regretted
in
a
small
bound
volume
they
insert
about
half
a
dozen
obscene
plates
which
are
cut
to
fit
the
size
of
the
printed
page
having
fixed
upon
a
victim
they
cautiously
draw
his
attention
to
the
pictures
by
rapidly
turning
over
the
leaves
but
do
not
allow
him
to
take
the
book
into
his
hands
although
they
give
him
a
good
opportunity
to
note
its
binding
he
never
dreams
that
the
plates
are
loose
and
feels
sure
that
in
buying
the
book
he
buys
the
pictures
also
when
the
price
is
agreed
upon
the
salesman
hints
that
as
he
is
watched
the
customer
had
better
turn
his
back
for
a
moment
while
taking
the
money
from
his
and
in
this
interval
he
slips
the
plates
from
between
the
leaves
and
conceals
them
the
next
moment
the
parties
are
again
face
to
face
the
price
is
handed
over
and
the
book
he
had
seen
before
is
handed
to
the
purchaser
under
a
renewed
caution
and
is
carefully
pocketed
the
leaves
and
at
the
first
opportunity
the
prize
is
covertly
drawn
forth
to
be
examined
more
minutely
and
the
unwary
one
finds
that
he
has
paid
several
dollars
for
some
few
printed
pages
without
pictures
which
would
have
been
dear
at
as
many
cents
despite
all
precautions
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
manufacture
of
these
obscene
books
is
largely
carried
on
in
this
city
it
is
needless
to
remind
any
resident
of
the
large
seizures
made
in
new
york
during
the
last
two
years
or
to
particularize
the
stock
condemned
more
caution
is
observed
now
and
the
is
made
the
vehicle
for
distribution
circulars
are
issued
which
describe
the
publications
and
their
prices
modes
of
transmitting
money
are
indicated
and
the
advertiser
plainly
says
that
he
will
not
allow
any
personal
interviews
on
account
of
the
dangers
which
surround
the
traffic
by
using
an
indefinite
number
of
and
often
changing
the
address
to
which
letters
are
sent
he
succeeds
in
eluding
the
vigilance
of
the
police
and
secures
many
remittances
not
less
dangerous
than
the
directly
obscene
publications
is
a
class
of
voluptuous
novels
which
is
rapidly
circulating
some
are
translations
from
the
french
but
one
man
now
living
in
england
has
written
and
published
more
disgustingly
minute
works
under
the
guise
of
honest
fiction
than
ever
emanated
from
the
parisian
presses
he
writes
in
a
strain
eminently
calculated
to
excite
the
passions
but
so
carefully
guarded
as
to
avoid
absolute
obscenity
and
embellishes
his
works
with
which
approach
lasciviousness
as
nearly
as
possible
without
being
indictable
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
publishers
have
been
found
in
this
and
other
cities
who
are
willing
to
use
their
imprints
on
the
of
his
trash
and
sell
works
which
can
not
but
be
productive
of
the
worst
consequences
those
who
have
seen
much
of
the
cheap
pamphlets
or
literature
offered
in
new
york
will
have
no
difficulty
in
recalling
the
name
of
the
author
alluded
to
and
those
who
are
ignorant
of
it
would
only
be
injured
by
its
disclosure
there
can
be
but
one
opinion
as
to
the
share
obscene
and
voluptuous
books
have
in
ruining
the
character
of
the
young
and
they
may
justly
be
considered
as
causes
indirect
it
may
be
of
prostitution
some
of
the
sources
of
prostitution
have
been
thus
examined
to
expose
them
all
would
require
a
volume
but
it
is
hoped
that
sufficient
has
been
developed
to
induce
observation
and
inquiry
and
prompt
action

the
premises

no

by
the
fact

above
that
seventeen
of
every
twenty
women
examined
in

reply
to
this
question
in
the
affirmative
for
it
is
almost
impossible
to
conceive
that
any
honest
occupation
can
be
associated
with
vice
of
such
character
the
small
minority
who
have
other
means
consists
principally
of
women
who
work
at
their
trades
or
occupations
at
intervals
or
who
receive
some
slight
payment
for
assisting
in
the
ordinary
work
or
for
sewing
in
the
houses
of
ill
fame
where
they
reside
it
is
difficult
to
believe
women
working
as
domestics
in
brothels
are
virtuous
themselves
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
fact
that
they
are
in
every
sense
of
the
word
prostitutes
the
only
difference
being
that
they
work
a
portion
of
the
time
while
the
boarders
do
not
work
at
all
those
who
follow
an
employment
at
intervals
are
mostly
women
whose
trades
are
uncertain
and
who
are
liable
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
to
be
without
employment
then
real
necessity
forces
them
on
the
town
until
a
return
of
business
provides
them
with
work
they
are
more
to
be
pitied
than
blamed
there
is
another
class
not
entirely
dependent
on
prostitution
it
consists
mostly
of
german
girls
who
receive
from
five
to
six
dollars
per
month
as
dancers
in
the
public
in
the
first
ward
of
new

there
are
several
of
these
establishments
and
the
captain
of
police
in
that
district
has
attached
some
interesting
memoranda
to
his
returns
from
which
is
gleaned
the
following
information
respecting
these
places
and
their
inhabitants
it
is
submitted
to
the
reader
in
order
that
he
may
draw
his
own
conclusions
as
to
the
virtue
of
the
dancers
these
are
generally
kept
by
germans
who
consider
dancing
a
proper
and
legitimate
business
they
are
in
general
very
quiet
the
girls
employed
to
dance
do
not
consider
themselves
prostitutes
because
the
proprietors
will
not
allow
them
to
be
known
as
such
each
girl
receives
monthly
from
five
to
six
dollars
and
her
board
and
almost
every
one
of
them
hires
a
room
in
the
neighborhood
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution
i
have
classed
them
all
as
prostitutes
because
in
addition
to
the
previous
fact
i
know
that
the
majority
of
them
have
lived
as
such
very
few
of
these
girls
are
excessive
drinkers
although
the
regulations
of
the
require
them
to
drink
after
each
dance
with
their
partners
yet
the
proprietor
has
always
a
bottle
of
water
slightly
colored
with
port
wine
from
which
they
drink
and
he
charges
the
partner
the
same
price
as
for
liquor
alluding
to
the
keeper
of
one
of
these
places
the
same
officer
says
the
proprietress
of
this
house
is
a
german
woman
over
seventy
years
of
age
she
established
the
house
over
eighteen
years
since
to
my
certain
knowledge
her
husband
had
just
then
arrived
from
germany
with
their
four
children
they
were
not

hundred

total
wherever
the
social

has
been
considered
one
fact
has
always
been
painfully
apparent
namely
the
difficulties
which
surround
her
in
any
attempt
to
procure
employment
beyond
the
beaten
track
of
needlework
or
domestic
service
numerous
light
or
sedentary
employments
now
pursued
by
men
might
with
much
greater
propriety
be
confided
to
women
but
custom
seems
to
have
fixed
an
arbitrary
law
which
can
not
be
altered
if
a
lady
enters
a
dry
goods
store
she
is
waited
upon
by
some
stalwart
young
man
whose
energy
and
muscle
would
be
far
more
useful
in
tilling
the
ground
or
in
some
other
employment
if
she
wishes
to
make
a
purchase
of
jewelry
she
is
served
by
the
same
class
of
attendants
why
should
not
females
have
this
branch
of
employment
at
their
command
it
would
in
a
majority
of
cases
be
more
consonant
with
the
feelings
of
the
purchasers
and
consequently
more
to
the
interest
of
it
would
open
an
honorable
field
of
exertion
to
the
women
and
improve
the
condition
of
the

who
now
monopolize
such
employments
by
forcing
them
to
obtain
work
suitable
to
their
sex
and
strength
and
driving
from
the
crowded
cities
into
the
open
country
some
whose
effeminacy
is
fast
bringing
them
to
positive
idleness
and
ruin
many
people
are
prepared
to
frown
upon
any
attempt
to
improve
the
social
condition
of
dependent
women
they
regard
it
as
a
part
of
that
myth
which
they
call
opposition
to
constituted
authorities
without
any
reference
to
the
consideration
which
should
form
the
basis
of
all
society
namely
ensuring
the
greatest
amount
of
good
to
the
greatest
number
others
who
are
opposed
to
any
amelioration
sustain
their
views
by
a
libel
upon
woman
and
upon
her
almighty
creator
they
assert
that
she
has
not
sufficient
intellect
for
any
thing
beyond
routine
employment
or
blame
her
because
she
has
received
only
such
an
imperfect
education
as
the
world
has
thought
proper
to
award
her
and
thus
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
cultivate
her
faculties
it
is
not
necessary
to
point
to
the
productions
and
achievements
of
women
even
in
our
own
days
omitting
all
mention
of
what
has
been
done
heretofore
to
expose
the
fallacy
of
this
proposition
the
facts
are
patent
to
the
world
with
special
reference
to
the
subject
in
hand
it
may
be
asserted
unhesitatingly
and
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
were
there
more
avenues
of
employment
open
to
females
there
would
be
a
corresponding
decrease
in
prostitution
and
many
of
those
who
are
now
ranked
with
the
daughters
of

members
of
the
community
in
the
list
of
occupations
pursued
by
the
women
who
are
now
prostitutes
in
new
york
a
most
lamentable
monotony
is
visible
domestic
service
and
sewing
are
the
two
principal
resources
from
the
gross
number
of
two
thousand

those
who
lived
with
their
parents
or
friends
children
attending
school
domestic
servants
and
housekeepers
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
and
there
is
a
balance
of
nearly
six
hundred
of
whom
depend
upon
needles
and
thread
for
an
existence
in
the
total
number
reported
there
are
four
or
exactly
one
in
every
five
who
relied
for
support
upon
any
occupation
requiring
mental
culture
that
is
one
artist
and
three
this
fact
in
itself
sustains
the
theories
that
mental
cultivation
and
sufficient
employment
are
restrictions
to
the
spread
of
prostitution
if
women
are
compelled
to
undergo
merely
the
slavery
of
life
no
moral
advancement
can
ever
be
expected
from
them
if
every
approach
to
remunerative
employment
is
systematically
closed
against
them
nothing
but
degradation
can
ensue
and
the
moralist
who
shuddered
with
horror
at
the
bare
possibility
of
a
woman
being
allowed
to
earn
a
competent
living
in
a
respectable
manner
will
ejaculate
what
awful
depravity
exists
in
the
female
sex
he
and
others
of
his
class
drive
a
woman
to
starvation
by
refusing
to
give
her
employment
and
then
condemn
her
for
maintaining
a
wretched
existence
at
the
price
of
virtue
but
to
notice
more
particularly
the
employments
which
the
courtesans
of
new
york
have
followed
the
domestic
servants
amount
to
no
modern
fashion
has
yet
been
introduced
to
deprive
females
of
this
sphere
of
labor
but
so
progressive
is
the
age
that
even
that
may
be
accomplished
within
a
few
years
and
the
advertising
columns
of
the
newspapers
teem
with
announcements
of
some
the
space
will
not
permit
any
extended
remarks
on
this
employment
but
while
allowing
that
many
employers
treat
their
servants
as
human
beings
gifted
with
the
same
sensibilities
and
feelings
as
themselves
it
must
be
regretted
that
there
are
others
who
use
them
in
a
manner
which
would
bring
a
blush
to
the
cheek
of
a
southern
with
such
mistresses
the
incapacity
of
servants
is
a
constant
theme
nor
do
they
ever
ask
themselves
if
they
have
learned
the
science
of
governing
assuming
that
they
themselves
are
right
they
conclude
that
the
help
is
of
course
wrong
is
it
any
wonder
that
girls
are
driven
to
intoxication
and
disgrace
by
this
conduct
another
reason
which
forces
to
prostitution
is
the
excessive
number
who
are
constantly
out
of
employment
estimated
at
one
fourth
of
those
resident
in
the
city
an
evil
which
would
be
diminished
were
there
more
opportunities
for
female
labor
what
is
the
position
of
the
far
worse
than
that
of
the
servant
the
latter
has
a
home
and
food
in
addition
to
her
wages
the
former
must
lodge
and
keep
herself
out
of
earnings
which
do
not
much
exceed
in
amount
the
servant
pay
the
labor
by
which
this
miserable
pittance
is
earned
so
truthfully
depicted
in
the
universally
known
song
of
the
shirt
is
distressing
and
enervating
to
a
degree
working
from
early
dawn
till
late
at
night
with
trembling
fingers
aching
head
and
very
often
an
empty
stomach
the
poor
seamstress
ruins
her
health
to
obtain
a
spare
and
insufficient
living
there
is
no
variety
in
her
employment
it
is
the
same
endless
round
of
stitches
varied
only
by
a
wearisome
journey
once
or
twice
a
week
to
the
store
whence
she
receives
her
work
and
where
the
probabilities
are
that
a
portion
of
her
scanty
wages
will
be
deducted
for
some
alleged
deficiency
in
the
work
she
has
no
redress
but
must
submit
or
be
discharged
nor
is
the
position
of
a
milliner
or
much
superior
to
this
she
has
a
room
provided
for
her
in
the
employer
establishment
and
there
she
must
remain
so
long
as
the
inexorable
demands
of
fashion
or
the
necessity
of
preparing
bonnets
or
dresses
for
some
special
occasion
require
it
matters
not
if
she
faint
from
exhaustion
and
fatigue
wants
her
and
the
poor
slave
we
use
this
word
advisedly
must
labor
as
if
her
eternal
salvation
rested
on
her
nimble
fingers
but
the
gay
robe
which
is
to
deck
the
form
of
beauty
is
completed
the
hour
of
release
has
come
at
last
and
as
at
night
the
wearied
girl
walks
feebly
through
the
almost
deserted
streets
she
meets
some
of
the
frail
of
her
own
sex
bedecked
in
finery
with
countenances
beaming
from
the
effects
of
their
potations
and
the
thought
flashes
across
her
mind
they
are
better
off
than
i
am
her
human
nature
can
scarcely
repress
such
an
exclamation
which
is
too
often
but
the
precursor
of
her
own
ruin
and
are
no
better
off
they
must
work
in
crowded
shops

inhale
each
other

speaking

as
their
remuneration
barely
sufficient
to
find
them

and
shelter
it
is
needless
to
pursue
this
subject
enough
has
surely
been
advanced
to
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
a
more
extended
field
of
female
labor
how
long
is
it

you
abandoned

would
arise
from
it

been
already
made
in
reference
to
other
questions
in
most
instances
the
occupation
is
abandoned
as
soon
as
the
first
false
step
is
taken
unless
in
those
cases
of
destitution
where
a
previous
want
of
employment
renders
prostitution
necessary
as
the
only
means
of
living
of
course
as
before
observed
a
life
of
prostitution
must
be
incompatible
with
any
description
of
honest
employment
and
in
those
cases
where
a
woman
has
followed
any
trade
or
occupation
after
she
had
yielded
to
promiscuous
intercourse
it
will
generally
be
found
that
her
motive
was
to
deceive
the
world
as
to
her
own
pursuits
or
else
to
satisfy
her
conscience
that
she
was

this
question
is
of
equal
importance
with
that
referring
to
the
number
of
employments
available
for
females
and
the
replies
quoted
above
will
give
as
many
reasons
for
prostitution
as
in
the
former
case
from
the
work
of
a
french
author
on
this
subject
the
following
is
condensed
as
indicative
of
the
hardships
and
insufficient
remuneration
of
women
employed
in
factories
in
france
women
are
employed
principally
in
the
manufacture
of
cotton
silk
and
wool
the
preparation
of
cotton
presents
two
dangerous
features
in
the
and
are
performed
solely
by
in
the
manufacture
of
silk
there
are
also
two
processes
dangerous
to
life
and
are
performed
by
the
woolen
manufacture
has
no
real
danger
but
in
the
and
the
carders
are
of
these
mortal
occupations
there
is
not
one
that
will
afford
the
workwoman
a
sufficient
maintenance
the
average
wages
being
from
sixteen
to
sous
per
day
subject
to
the
fluctuations
of
trade
commenting
upon
these
facts
the
westminster
review
says
we
took
some
pains
to
ascertain
the
relative
wages
of
men
and
women
employed
in
the
same
trades
in
england
and
almost
in
every
instance
it
appeared
that
for
the
same
work
performed
in
the
same
time
they
received
one
third
less
sometimes
one
half
less
than
men
without
any
inferiority
of
skill
being
alleged
one
master
gravely
said
that
he
women
less
because
they
ate
in
a
subsequent
chapter
of
this
volume
will
be
found
some
particulars
of
the
wages
paid
in
manufacturing
districts
of
the
united
states
and
the
same
disparity
between
male
and
female
operatives
will
be
noticed
assigns
insufficient
wages
as
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
prostitution
in
paris
he
says
what
are
the
earnings
of
our
laundresses
our
seamstresses
our
milliners
compare
the
wages
of
the
most
skillful
with
those
of
the
more
ordinary
and
moderately
able
and
we
shall
see
if
it
be
possible
for
these
latter
to
procure
even
the
strict
necessaries
of
life
and
if
we
farther
compare
the
price
of
their
work
with
that
of
their
dishonor
we
shall
cease
to
be
surprised
that
so
great
a
number
should
fall
into
improprieties
thus
made
almost
inevitable
this
low
rate
of
wages
is
defended
upon
the
plea
of
competition
a
manufacturer
practically
says
if
one
man
or
woman
will
do
my
work
for
five
per
cent
less
than
another
i
must
employ
him
or
her
unless
i
am
prepared
to
carry
on
my
business
at
a
positive
loss
for
if
i
do
not
give
them
work
my
neighbor
will
valid
as
this
reason
may
be
in
the
old
countries
where
the
supply
of
labor
far
exceeds
the
demand
it
is
invalid
in
america
where
there
is
a
constant
demand
for
workers
our
cities
are
overcrowded
remove
some
of
their
inhabitants
to
the
country
in
our
cities
work
can
not
be
obtained
in
the
country
both
male
and
female
laborers
are
urgently
required
in
cities
an
unemployed
woman
is
exposed
to
innumerable
temptations
in
the
country
she
need
never
be
unemployed
and
consequently
would
escape
such
dangers
the
difference
between
the
new
and
old
worlds
is
simply
that
in
the
former
the
cities
are
overcrowded
but
the
country
is
free
in
the
latter
both
cities
and
country
are
full
to
repletion
in
the
city
of
new
york
one
fourth
part
of
the
domestic
servants
are
constantly
out
of
employment
remove
them
and
while
the
wants
of
the
community
will
be
amply
supplied
the
market
value
of
a
faithful
servant
would
increase
to
a
living
rate
send
away
a
number
of
reducing
the
supply
of
labor
to
meet
the
actual
demand
tailors
and
must
employ
seamstresses
and
in
such
cases
they
could
not
obtain
them
without
paying
remunerative
wages
the
prices
of
our
wearing
apparel
would
probably
be
advanced
five
per
with
a
saving
of
fifteen
per
cent
taxation
in
the
reduced
expenses
of
police
judiciary
prisons
hospitals
and
charitable
institutions
the
experience
of
the
winter
of
has
proved
that
but
very
slight
difficulties
attend
this
plan
when
efficiently
carried
out
and
to
the
children
aid
society
and
the
other
benevolent
organizations
which
have
shown
not
only
the
possibility
but
the
success
of
the
system
all
praise
is
due
no
man
entering
upon
a
farm
in
the
west
requires
any
argument
to
convince
him
that
his
property
will
increase
in
value
as
it
is
cultivated
and
many
will
gladly
advance
the
sum
necessary
to
pay
the
expenses
of
a
servant
journey
out
as
fast
as
men
are
sent
to
fell
the
timber
or
break
the
prairie
the
farmer
necessities
force
him
to
engage
women
for
the
increasing
work
of
his
house
and
dairy
and
to
supply
the
places
of
those
who
obtain
husbands
in
their
new
home
when
the
tide
of
emigration
to
the
australian
colonies
commenced
nearly
the
whole
of
those
who
left
england
were
single
men
and
in
a
few
months
the
cry
was
ringing
from
one
end
of
the
island
to
the
other
send
us
female
help
send
us
wives
a
benevolent
woman
resident
in
the
colony
repeated
the
demand
and
subsequently
lent
the
aid
of
her
powerful
talents
to
it
she
made
a
voyage
to
england
and
there
influenced
public
opinion
to
such
an
extent
that
the
british
government
yielded
to
the
outside
pressure
and
many
of
healthy
and
virtuous
women
were
sent
out
at
the
national
expense
to
supply
the
want
the
subsequent
advancement
of
the
colony
has
proved
that
the
measure
was
a
judicious
one
nor
can
the
abuses
to
which
it
became
subject
detract
from
its
merits
similar
plans
with
respect
to
destitute
children
have
been
practiced
in
new
york
for
several
years
and
their
subsequent
extension
to
meet
the
wants
of
adult
females
has
been
limited
only
by
the
means
of
the
projectors
if
the
necessity
and
prospective
benefit
of
this
emigration
were
known
and
appreciated
the
required
funds
could
be
raised
without
any
difficulty
the
citizens
of
new
york
are
never
dilatory
in
responding
to
calls
upon
their
benevolence
in
aid
of
any
practicable
and
judicious
scheme
of
philanthropy
and
under
the
management
of
an
energetic
business
committee
arrangements
could
be
made
which
would
render
the
movement
within
a
few
years
the
competition
which
keeps
wages
at
starvation
point
is
aggravated
by
a
notion
entertained
by
many
native
women
and
by
some
foreigners
who
have
been
long
in
the
country
that
domestic
service
is
ungenteel
this
idea
drives
them
to
needlework
to
maintain
their
respectability
and
thus
while
service
is
abandoned
the
ranks
of
seamstresses
are
augmented
by
decreasing
the
number
to
be
employed
and
consequently
advancing
their
wages
and
insuring
better
treatment
from
their
employers
the
life
would
be
divested
of
many
of
its
objections
and
would
once
more
be
deemed
respectable
this
consummation
rests
more
with
mistresses
than
servants
the
former
give
tone
to
the
manners
of
the
latter
it
can
not
be
denied
that
many
young
women
date
their
ruin
from
unkind
or
unwomanly
treatment
by
their
mistresses
who
have
given
a
free
rein
to
their
caprices
confident
that
if
a
girl
left
them
they
could
soon
supply
her
place
this
confidence
would
be
shaken
if
a
housekeeper
knew
that
servants
were
less
plentiful
and
her
own
interest
would
induce
her
to
use
well
those
who
suited
her
such
a
conclusion
would
be
an
important
step
toward
reducing
prostitution
and
elevating
the
character
of
the
masses
it
can
not
be
expected
that
this
vice
will
decrease
in
new
york
when
five
hundred
and
out
of
a
total
of
two
thousand
earn
only
one
dollar
weekly
no
economist
however
closely
he
may
calculate
will
pretend
that
fourteen
cents
a
day
will
supply
any
woman
with
lodging
food
and
clothes
she
who
should
attempt
to
exist
on
such
a
sum
would
starve
to
death
in
less
than
a
month
and
yet
it
is
a
notorious
fact
that
many
are
expected
to
support
themselves
upon
it
how
such
expectations
are
realized
and
the
sad
manner
in
which
the
deficiency
is
made
up
are
amply
shown
by
the
result
of
this
and
similar
investigations
here
and
elsewhere
thus
far
manufacturers
have
been
blamed
for
the
depression
of
wages
but
is
not
the
consumer
equally
open
to
censure
he
purchases
an
article
of
dress
from
a
because
it
is
a
trifle
cheaper
than
in
b
store
the
cost
of
the
raw
material
is
the
same
to
each
and
each
uses
the
same
quantity
in
every
article
but
if
a
can
find
customers
for
three
times
the
amount
of
goods
which
b
can
sell
on
account
of
the
saving
he
effects
through
paying
lower
wages
it
is
scarcely
in
human
nature
decidedly
not
in
commercial
nature
to
be
expected
that
he
will
refuse
the
opportunity
he
flatters
himself
that
competition
forces
him
to
make
the
reduction
and
as
the
public
do
not
denounce
his
action
but
flock
to
his
store
so
long
as
his
price
continues
lower
than
his
neighbor
he
concludes
that
his
customers
should
bear
the
blame
nor
are
his
conclusions
false
the
public
sanction
a
system
which
enforces
starvation
or
crime
and
for
the
sake
of
saving
a
few
cents
add
their
influence
to
swell
the
ranks
of
prostitutes
and
condemn
many
a
poor
woman
to
eternal
ruin
before
leaving
the
question
of
employment
the
effects
of
different
branches
of
female
occupation
as
inducing
or
favoring
immorality
must
be
noticed
apart
from
the
low
rate
of
wages
paid
to
women
thus
causing
destitution
which
forces
them
to
vice
the
associations
of
most
of
the
few
trades
they
are
in
the
habit
of
pursuing
are
prejudicial
to
virtue
the
trade
of
tailoress
or
seamstress
may
be
cited
as
a
case
in
point
one
mode
in
which
this
business
is
conducted
between
employer
and
employed
is
as
follows
the
woman
leaves
either
a
cash
deposit
or
the
guarantee
of
some
responsible
person
at
the
store
and
receives
a
certain
amount
of
materials
to
be
made
up
by
a
specified
time
when
she
returns
the
manufactured
goods
she
is
paid
and
has
more
work
given
her
to
make
up
this
may
seem
a
very
simple
course
and
so
it
is
but
one
feature
in
it
gives
rather
a
sinister
aspect
the
person
who
delivers
the
materials
receives
the
work
and
pronounces
on
its
execution
is
almost
invariably
a
man
and
upon
his
decision
rests
the
question
whether
the
operative
shall
be
paid
her
full
wages
or
whether
any
portion
of
her
miserable
earnings
shall
be
deducted
because
the
work
is
not
done
to
his
satisfaction
in
many
cases
he
wields
a
power
the
determinations
of
which
amount
to
this
shall
i
have
any
food
or
shall
i
starve
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
hardly
any
thing
short
of
positive
want
can
force
a
girl
to
undertake
this
labor
at
its
present
price
and
it
is
reasonable
to
imagine
that
her
necessities
will
force
her
to
use
every
means
to
accomplish
her
task
in
a
satisfactory
manner
if
she
finds
that
a
smile
bestowed
upon
her
employer
or
his
clerk
will
aid
her
in
the
struggle
for
bread
she
will
not
present
herself
with
a
scowling
face
or
if
a
kind
entreaty
will
be
the
means
of
procuring
her
a
dinner
as
a
favor
she
will
not
expose
herself
to
hunger
by
demanding
it
as
a
right
in
this
there
is
no
moral
or
actual
wrong
but
there
are
instances
where
lubricity
has
exacted
farther
concessions
and
the
sacrifice
of
a
woman
virtue
been
required
as
an
equivalent
for
the
privilege
of
sewing
at
almost
nominal
prices
if
this
is
conceded
the
victim
may
be
assured
of
the
best
work
and
the
most
favors
until
her
seducer
becomes
satiated
with
possession
when
means
will
easily
be
found
to
displace
her
for
some
new
favorite
if
the
outrageous
request
is
denied
she
will
get
no
more
work
from
that
shop
and
may
seek
other
employment
with
almost
a
certainty
of
meeting
the
same
indignity
elsewhere
that
this
is
a
frequent
occurrence
unfortunately
can
not
be
denied
that
it
exercises
much
influence
on
public
prostitution
can
not
be
doubted
the
employment
of
females
in
various
trades
in
this
city
in
the
pursuit
of
which
they
are
forced
into
constant
communication
with
male
operatives
has
a
disastrous
effect
upon
their
characters
the
daily
routine
goes
very
far
toward
weakening
that
modesty
and
reserve
which
are
the
best
protectives
against
the
seducer
and
renders
them
liable
to
temptation
in
many
shapes
a
girl
frequently
forms
an
attachment
to
a
man
working
in
the
same
shop
believing
it
to
be
a
mutual
one
and
only
finds
out
her
mistake
when
she
has
yielded
to
his
persuasions
and
is
deserted
or
women
contract
acquaintance
for
the
sake
of
having
an
escort
on
their
holiday
recreations
or
because
some
other
woman
has
done
so
or
as
the
mere
gratification
of
an
idle
fancy
but
all
tend
in
the
same
direction
and
aid
to
undermine
principles
and
jeopardize
character
in
this
connection
only
city
employments
have
been
mentioned
but
the
same
reasoning
may
be
applied
with
greater
force
to
factory
life
in
any
of
our
manufacturing
districts
there
the
operatives
of
both
sexes
in
one
mill
may
sometimes
be
counted
by
hundreds
and
their
large
numbers
cause
a
more
frequent
and
constant
communication
than
in
smaller
workshops
it
has
been
urged
in
support
of
the
superior
morality
of
such
places
that
the
very
nature
of
the
employment
requires
the
most
constant
attention
to
be
paid
to
it
and
precludes
the
possibility
of
any
idle
time
we
freely
concede
to
the
apologists
all
the
advantages
they
claim
and
admit
that
during
the
time
say
ten
hours
daily
when
the
machinery
is
running
neither
males
nor
females
can
abandon
their
respective
positions
but
unfortunately
for
the
force
of
the
argument
the
motion
is
not
a
perpetual
one
a
or
a
can
run
for
a
week
or
a
month
without
complaining
of
fatigue
but
human
machines
become
exhausted
after
a
few
hours
consecutive
labor
machinery
can
receive
the
necessary
attention
and
supplies
without
arresting
its
progress
but
men
and
women
must
sometimes
cease
work
in
order
to
eat
and
drink
granting
then
that
during
actual
working
hours
a
young
woman
can
not
leave
her
post
yet
the
mind
is
free
and
the
range
of
thought
when
locomotion
is
denied
her
will
often
turn
to
the
hardships
of
her
position
busy
as
may
be
her
hands
her
brain
is
disengaged
and
while
her
mechanical
duties
are
adroitly
performed
the
mental
faculties
will
be
in
full
exercise
and
for
these
she
has
ample
scope
dissatisfied
with
her
close
confinement
in
the
factory
weary
of
the
dreadful
monotony
which
makes
but
a
repetition
of
yesterday
and
a
sure
type
of
she
is
happy
when
the
bell
rings
the
signal
to
leave
work
to
escape
from
the
building
and
renew
outside
its
walls
an
acquaintance
she
has
formed
before
and
too
frequently
the
persuasions
and
promises
of
her
lover
will
induce
her
to
seek
in
some
less
guarded
position
the
independence
for
which
she
longs
it
may
be
taken
as
a
general
rule
that
any
confinement
or
restraint
which
is
irksome
to
human
nature
must
result
injuriously
domestic
servants
are
not
exempt
from
temptation
when
employed
in
large
establishments
where
both
sexes
are
engaged
and
many
a
poor
girl
ascribes
her
ruin
to
the
associations
formed
in
places
of
this
description
thus
far
it
has
been
supposed
that
man
is
the
chief
agent
in
the
propagation
of
vice
nor
is
there
any
apparent
reason
to
recede
from
that
position
the
numerous
cases
of
seduction
under
false
promises
and
subsequent
desertion
of
seduction
by
married
men
of
violations
of
helpless
and
unprotected
females
are
abundantly
sufficient
to
prove
this
much
as
it
may
be
regretted
for
the
credit
of
the
stronger
sex
and
also
to
vindicate
the
opinion
that
employing
males
and
females
under
one
roof
in
different
branches
of
the
same
business
has
a
strong
tendency
to
promote
prostitution
sometimes
however
it
is
true
that
woman
lost
and
abandoned
herself
lends
her
aid
to
drag
her
down
to
perdition
in
many
of
the
stores
and
workshops
in
our
city
in
every
factory
throughout
the
country
such
are
to
be
found
and
their
insidious
influence
is
quickly
felt
by
false
representations
and
elaborate
coloring
they
work
upon
the
minds
of
the
simple
or
inflame
the
passions
of
the
ambitious
but
in
either
case
their
object
is
the

it

this
table
shows
that
almost
all
classes
of
society
are
exposed
to
the
influences
which
result
in
prostitution
from
the
children
of
men
of
property
bankers
merchants
and
professional
men
down
to
the
families
of
mechanics
and
laborers
the
numerous
and
varied
occupations
of
the
fathers
of
those
women
who
answered
the
question
renders
any
classification
of
them
almost
impossible
a
majority
of
the
parents
were
either
mechanics
or
laborers
men
who
earned
the
daily
food
for
themselves
and
families
by
manual
labor
and
whose
resources
would
be
governed
by
the
ordinary
fluctuations
of
trade
in
following
the
proportion
of
natives
and
foreigners
as
exhibited
in
previous
tables
it
must
be
remembered
that
about
five
eighths
of
these
fathers
were
residents
of
other
countries
than
the
united
states
when
those
daughters
were
born
whose
replies
form
the
bases
of
these
statistics
and
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
labor
is
nowhere
so
well
remunerated
as
with
us
the
average
wages
for
instance
of
a
mechanic
in
england
or
ireland
seldom
exceed
and
indeed
rarely
amount
to
nine
dollars
per
week
and
an
ordinary
laborer
is
very
well
paid
if
he
receives
half
that
sum
this
estimate
refers
to
large
cities
where
the
expenses
of
maintaining
a
family
are
as
heavy
as
in
new
york
and
it
indicates
poverty
which
has
already
been
proved
to
be
one
of
the
main
causes
of
female
depravity
if
the
investigation
is
pursued
into
the
rural
districts
of

britain
the

be
found
lower
than
they

reduction
in
the

expenditure
except
in
the
item
of
the

only
cents
a

will
surprise
any
one
who

not
fully
acquainted

the
hardships
endured
by
this
unfortunate
class

the
state
of
destitution
in
which
they
are

to
it
can
not
with

propriety
be
called

more
than
one
half
of
the
foreigners
are
from
ireland
and
no
person
acquainted
with
the
social
history
of
that
unhappy
country
need
be
told
of
the
want
and
deprivation
endured
by
its
peasantry
of
their
useless
efforts
to
benefit
themselves
or
of
the
ruin
starvation
and
disease
with
which
they
are
so
frequently
afflicted
to
constitute
a
farmer
in
ireland
a
man
must
hire
an
acre
or
two
of
land
for
which
he
pays
a
heavy
rent
as
two
or
sometimes
three
have
to
obtain
their
profits
before
the
landlord
receives
his
share
in
this
field
he
plants
as
many
potatoes
as
can
be
crowded
into
it
and
in
his
hut
or
cabin
he
keeps
a
pig
or
some
fowls
regularly
domesticated
as
members
of
the
family
and
receiving
more
attention
than
the
children
from
the
sale
of
the
pig
the
rent
has
to
be
obtained
and
from
the
proceeds
of
the
poultry
with
the
potatoes
all
their
wants
have
to
be
supplied
thus
with
the
potatoes
he
raises
for
almost
his
sole
means
of
support
with
peat
from
some
bog
in
the
neighborhood
to
furnish
him
with
fuel
he
lives
until
the
impoverished
soil
refuses
to
yield
its
annual
crop
or
yields
it
in
a
diseased
and
poisonous
state
when
fever
and
starvation
come
to
fill
his
cup
of
misery
and
render
him
dependent
upon
charity
for
an
existence
and
this
in
a
land
peculiarly
rich
in
all
that
is
necessary
to
make
its
people
a
great
and
happy
nation
this
has
been
known
as
the
state
of
ireland
for
many
years
and
in
this
condition
it
unquestionably
was
when
the
women
who
here
are
now
prostitutes
were
born
there
whether
the
severe
lessons
taught
by
the
last

the
more
enlightened

liberal
policy
which
has
governed

since
that
terrible
calamity

the
introduction
of

enterprise
and
the
large
exodus
of
the
natives
of

have
been
of
advantage
to
the
country
it
is
difficult
to
determine
in
the
face
of
the
conflicting
testimony
furnished
respectively
by
english
and
irish
partisans
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
that
an
improvement
must
have
taken
place
under
these
circumstances
but
this
is
not
the
place
to
argue
the
political
questions
so
often
agitated
there
and
elsewhere
it
is
enough
for
the
purpose
of
this
work
to
show
the
poverty
of
twenty
years
ago
and
the
vice
resulting
from
it
now
and
to
remind
the
reader
that
because
of
the
lamentable
manner
in
which
the
irish
have
suffered
in

calamity

nourished

mournful

less
degree
in
order
to
maintain
that
artificial
state
of
excitement
which
is
indispensably
necessary
to
their
calling
one
of
the
class
in
london
said
to
mayhew
when
he
was
making
the
inquiries
alluded
to
in
the
chapters
upon
english
prostitution
could
the
life
we
do
without
and
drinking
is
undoubtedly
universal
among
abandoned
women
even
according
to
the
most
favorable
view
of
the
replies
to
the
query
now
under
consideration
and
admitting
them
to
be
strictly
correct
it
will
be
found
that
five
sixths
of
the
total
number
confess
they
are
in
the
habit
of
using
intoxicating
liquors
but
with
the
knowledge
of
facts
already
ascertained
in
other
cases
the
inquirer
will
be
compelled
to
believe
that
this
is
not
the
whole
truth
for
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
three
hundred
and
who
claim
to
be
total
abstinents
indulge
themselves
in
occasional
potations
in
prosecuting
investigations
like
the
present
there
are
many
difficulties
to
encounter
a
woman
who
is
found
residing
in
a
house
of
ill
fame
will
scarcely
attempt
to
deny
that
she
is
a
prostitute
although
even
this
has
been
done
in
some
cases
yet
she
will
equivocate
upon
other
matters
the
facts
of
her
birth
family
and
life
will
probably
be
given
correctly
because
there
exists
no
motive
for
concealment
but
the
answers
to
any
questions
which
she
deems
degrading
such
as
relate
for
example
to
her
habits
or
the
state
of
her
health
must
be
received
with
some
considerable
allowance
and
compared
with
facts
among
the
more
aristocratic
prostitutes
it
is
considered
a
disgrace
to
be
absolutely
intoxicated
and
the
keeper
of
a
house
would
scarcely
retain
a
boarder
who
was
addicted
to
habitual
inebriety
still
the
most
fastidious
are
ready
and
eager
to
sell
champagne
or
what
passes
for
it
to
any
visitor
of
liberal
disposition
and
will
generally
condescend
to
assist
him
to
drink
it
of
course
inviting
all
the
ladies
to
participate
in
the
lower
grades
it
is
not
deemed
disreputable
to
be
inebriated
but
the
proprietors
knowing
intoxication
would
interfere
with
their
business
interdict
it
until
late
at
night
when
the
mirth
and
fun
grows
fast
and
furious
and
when
visitors
women
proprietors
and
servants
frequently
all
contrive
to
be
drunk
and
close
the
night
with
a
general
saturnalia
the
following
morning
every
thing
is
changed
the
proprietor
takes
his
stand
behind
the
bar
and
tenders
the
inmates
as
they
appear
their
bitters
namely
a
bumper
of
raw
spirits
the
visitors
depart
about
their
business
and
the
women
await
with
all
the
patience
they
can
command
the
result
of
another
day
campaign
anxiously
watching
for
any
contingency
which
may
arise
likely
to
bring
them
another
glass
of
liquor
even
in
this
case
they
are
narrowly
watched
and
as
soon
as
the
depression
from
the
previous
night
debauch
has
been
overcome
they
must
either
take
temperance
drinks
or
colored
water
when
any
stray
customer
invites
them
to
the
bar
decided
impression
is
that
not
one
per
cent
of
the
prostitutes
in
new
york
practice
their
calling
without
partaking
of
intoxicating
the
effects
of
this
habit
are
well
known
in
the
first
instance
the
woman
drinks
but
little
probably
just
enough
to
cause
a
slight
artificial
excitement
and
bring
a
color
to
her
cheeks
after
a
time
the
proportion
must
be
increased
as
the
effect
upon
the
system
is
diminished
until
the
finale
is
a
habit
of
confirmed
and
constant
drinking
as
a
general
rule
the
horrible
consequences
then
become
apparent
the
whole
frame
is
relaxed
and
every
movement
of
the
limbs
is
a
motion
of
uncertainty
the
brain
is
impaired
the
reasoning
faculties
are
destroyed
the
powers
of
the
stomach
and
digestive
organs
are
weakened
and
an
attack
of
delirium
tremens
is
the
usually
cured
if
cured
at
all
at
the
public
expense
in
a
hospital
or
prison
a
work
of
fiction
published
some
ten
years
ago
gives
the
following
truthful
account
of
the
effects
of
drunkenness
on
prostitutes
by
one
of
whom
the
words
are
supposed
to
be
used
i
must
have
drink
such
as
live
like
me
could
not
bear
life
without
drink
it
the
only
thing
to
keep
us
from
suicide
if
we
did
not
drink
we
could
not
stand
the
memory
of
what
we
have
been
and
the
thought
of
what
we
are
for
a
day
if
i
go
without
food
and
without
shelter
i
must
have
my
dram
oh
what
awful
nights
i
have
had
in
prison
for
want
of
it
she
glared
round
with
terrified
eyes
as
if
dreading
to
see
some
supernatural
creature
near
her
and
then
continued
it
is
dreadful
to
see
them
there
they
go
round
and
round
my
bed
the
whole
night
through
my
mother
carrying
my
baby
and
sister
mary
and
all
looking
at
me
with
their
sad
stony
eyes
oh
it
is
terrible
they
do
turn
back
either
but
pass
behind
the
head
of
the
bed
and
i
feel
their
eyes
on
me
every
where
if
i
creep
under
the
clothes
i
still
see
them
and
what
is
worse
they
see
me
must
have
drink
i
can
not
pass
without
a
dram
i
dare
although
this
is
an
imaginary
picture
its
counterpart
can
be
seen
at
almost
any
time
in
the
hospitals
under
the
charge
of
the
governors
of
the
alms
house
on
blackwell
island
new
york
city
where
large
numbers
of
such
cases
are
constantly
treated
in
in
the
penitentiary
hospital
alone
more
than
fourteen
hundred
persons
received
medical
assistance
for
delirium
tremens
and
other
maladies
arising
from
excess
in
drinking
this
fact
induced
the
remarks
in
the
report
for
that
year
that
the
cases
actually
treated
here
during
the
last
year
were
directly
caused
by
the
lowest
and
foulest
kinds
of
dissipation
and
vice
a
fact
which
speaks
in
favor
of
shutting
up
shops
and
shows
the
absolute
necessity
of
adopting
some
plan
whereby
the
enormous
amount
of
prostitution
now
among
us
shall
be
decreased
since
then
an
alteration
in
the
law
has
sentenced
drunken
persons
to
an
incarceration
in
the
city
prison
and
the
number
sent
to
blackwell
island
has
diminished
but
not
to
the
extent
which
would
be
supposed
as
during
the
hospitals
thereon
afforded
relief
to
seven
hundred
and
inebriates
the
fearful
havoc
upon
the
constitution
is
produced
as
well
by
the
quality
as
the
quantity
of
the
liquors
consumed
let
any
man
not
thoroughly
informed
on
these
subjects
taste
a
glass
of
the
compounds
retailed
at
these
places
and
he
will
be
immediately
convinced
that
it
would
be
quite
as
judicious
an
act
to
swallow
the
same
quantity
of
camphene
or
sulphuric
acid
if
diluted
sweetened
and
colored
the
various
liquors
gin
rum
brandy
whisky
or
wine
having
nothing
in
common
with
the
genuine
articles
of
commerce
but
the
name
are
so
many
varieties
of
the
cheapest
and
most
poisonous
raw
spirits
that
the
markets
afford
and
are
manufactured
in
this
city
in
large
quantities
to
meet
the
demands
arising
from
such
places
instances
have
been
known
where
liquors
subsequently
sold
in
houses
of
ill
fame
as
pure
french
brandy
have
been
furnished
by
wholesale
dealers
at
prices
ranging
from
to
fifty
cents
a
gallon
there
may
be
exceptions
some
few
brothels
of
the
higher
rank
may
sell
what
is
called
good
liquor
but
they
are
very
rare
indeed
is
it
any
matter
of
surprise
that
drunkenness
or
more
properly
speaking
stupefaction
and
insensibility
are
so
rife
that
so
many
constitutions
are
ruined
and
so
many
characters
destroyed
when
agencies
like
these
are
tolerated
did
your
father
drink
intoxicating
liquors
if
so
to
what
extent
fathers
habits
numbers
did
not
drink
liquor
drank
moderately
intemperately
unascertained

did
your
mother
drink
intoxicating
liquors
if
so
to
what
extent
mothers
habits
numbers
did
not
drink
liquor
drank
moderately
intemperately
unascertained
totals
aggregate
how
much
of
the
intemperate
habits
of
these
women
must
be
traced
to
the
influence
of
the
parent
example
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
fathers
one
thousand
one
hundred
and
mothers
are
represented
as
having
been
addicted
to
the
use
of
liquors
in
various
degrees
the
moderate
in
both
cases
exceeding
the
intemperate
drinkers
and
yet
even
moderate
drinking
when
pursued
by
parents
in
the
presence
of
or
to
the
knowledge
of
children
is
a
practice
open
to
the
gravest
censure
in
the
mind
of
a
child
any
action
is
deemed
right
if
performed
by
a
father
or
mother
as
the
children
advance
in
years
parental
customs
are
followed
and
in
such
a
case
as
this
probably
the
single
glass
of
beer
or
wine
of
the
father
lays
the
foundation
of
intemperance
in
the
children
without
undertaking
to
argue
the
question
of
the
absolute
necessity
for
a
total
abstinence
from
all
liquors
under
all
circumstances
the
proposition
may
be
seriously
submitted
that
the
effect
of
this
personal
example
upon
children
is
satisfactorily
ascertained
from
many
different
sources
to
be
prejudicial
to
their
best
interests
and
a
natural
deduction
therefore
is
that
it
is
the
duty
of
parents
to
abstain
instances
are
upon
record
where
both
fathers
and
mothers
in
the
temporary
insanity
of
intoxication
have
turned
their
daughters
from
home
into
the
streets
and
that
too
in
cases
where
not
even
the
remotest
grounds
existed
for
any
suspicion
of
improper
conduct
on
the
part
of
these
children
occurrences
like
this
are
sufficient
to
enforce
the
necessity
of
temperance
on
the
part
of
parents
in
view
of
the
fearful
responsibility
which
rests
upon
them
were
your
parents
protestants
catholics
or
religion
numbers
protestants
roman
catholics
total
were
you
trained
to
any
religion
if
so
was
it
protestant
or
catholic
religion
numbers
protestant
roman
catholic
no
religious
training
total
do
you
profess
the
same
religion
now
profession
numbers
profess
religion
as
educated
total
how
long
is
it
since
you
have
observed
any
of
its
requirements
time
numbers
year
and
under
from
to
years
unascertained
totals
it
certainly
seems
a
very
incongruous
association
to
connect
religion
and
prostitution
to
place
in
juxtaposition
the
most
noble
aspirations
of
which
the
mind
is
capable
and
the
lowest
degradation
to
which
the
body
can
descend
but
such
a
contrast
is
not
without
its
moral
it
is
not
too
great
a
stretch
of
imagination
to
suppose
that
of
those
unfortunate
women
who
subsequently
lost
their
position
in
society
some
had
the
advantages
of
an
early
christian
education
were
taught
to
believe
in
and
reverence
the
inspired
writings
were
taught
that
there
is
a
god
who
judgeth
the
world
and
that
there
exists
for
all
a
future
state
reflecting
upon
this
and
considering
how
deplorably
such
have
fallen
from
the
observance
of
precepts
inculcated
in
the
days
of
childhood
all
persons
will
feel
the
necessity
of
watchfulness
and
care
that
the
same
fate
does
not
befall
themselves
or
their
connections
the
facts
may
teach
another
lesson
it
may
be
presumed
that
some
of
these
women
were
trained
in
the
rigid
and
austere
manner
animadverted
upon
in
the
remarks
on
the
causes
of
prostitution
and
that
their
present
career
is
but
the
recoil
from
that
unnatural
restraint
such
conclusion
would
afford
a
solemn
warning
to
all
who
have
charge
of
the
education
of
children
to
choose
the
happy
mean
between
the
extremes
of
careless
laxity
and
excessive
harshness
either
course
is
alike
fatal
to
the
welfare
of
their
trust
and
must
end
in
disappointment
and
sorrow
if
it
were
consistent
with
propriety
it
would
not
be
possible
to
make
any
comparison
between
the
results
of
protestant
and
roman
catholic
teachings
because
of
the
nearly
equal
number
in
each
case
in
the
table
exhibiting
the
religions
professed
by
the
parents
there
are
seventeen
more
roman
catholics
than
protestants
in
the
table
of
the
religions
professed
by
the
prostitutes
themselves
there
are
five
more
roman
catholics
than
protestants
the
relative
value
of
the
two
creeds
as
rules
of
life
can
not
therefore
be
made
the
subject
of
argument
from
such
data
so
far
as
our
duties
to
the
almighty
to
our
and
to
ourselves
so
far
as
the
obligations
to
virtue
and
morality
are
concerned
the
adherents
of
both
parties
are
agreed
and
in
the
investigation
of
the
intricate
social
problem
of
female
depravity
it
matters
but
little
whether
a
majority
of
the
pitiable
subjects
of
the
inquiry
were
educated
in
the
tenets
of
the
church
of
rome
or
in
the
doctrines
of
the
reformation
if
the
articles
of
faith
of
either
church
are
honestly
observed
by
those
who
professedly
believe
in
them
they
will
be
effective
in
preventing
immorality
but
when
this
observance
is
confined
to
words
and
not
exemplified
by
actions
neither
the
simple
rituals
of
protestantism
nor
the
more
elaborate
and
artistically
arranged
ceremonials
of
roman
catholicism
can
be
of
any
avail
neither
if
our
lives
accord
not
with
our
profession
will
it
make
an
iota
of
difference
in
our
future
destiny
whether
we
have
bowed
the
knee
in
a
temple
devoted
to
roman
catholic
service
before
the
image
of
a
crucified
savior
and
endeavored
to
train
our
thoughts
to
a
contemplation
of
his
mercy
and
beneficence
or
have
knelt
in
a
protestant
church
and
there
joined
in
the
public
confession
that
we
are
sinners
the
facts
exhibited
in
the
tables
show
that
women
had
parents
who
were
professedly
members
of
one
or
the
other
of
these
communions
that
women
out
of
were
taught
to
believe
in
the
necessity
of
some
religion
and
that
of
these
women
still
assert
their
confidence
in
the
creed
in
which
they
were
educated
it
can
not
be
expected
that
living
in
the
constant
practice
of
that
which
their
consciences
must
teach
them
is
sinful
these
women
would
have
continued
to
observe
the
outward
form
of
religion
by
comparing
the
table
upon
this
point
with
the
one
framed
from
the
replies
to
the
question
for
what
length
of
time
have
you
been
a
prostitute
it
will
be
observed
that
admit
they
have
been
prostitutes
for
six
years
and
upward
and
confess
they
have
neglected
to
observe
the
requirements
of
religion
for
the
same
space
of
time
a
coincidence
which
leads
us
charitably
to
suppose
that
the
crime
and
the
omission
are
nearly
parallel
so
far
as
dates
are
concerned
and
that
hypocritical
professions
of
religion
do
not
rank
among
prostitutes
offenses
but
even
with
their
neglect
of
the
outward
requirements
of
faith
and
while
in
the
actual
commission
of
known
and
acknowledged
sin
they
still
preserve
many
traits
which
are
much
to
their
credit
they
possess
one
of
the
chief
virtues
belonging
to
the
female
character
which
never
seems
to
become
extinct
or
materially
impaired
namely
kindness
to
each
other
when
sick
or
destitute
and
indeed
to
all
who
are
in
suffering
or
distress
this
has
attracted
the
attention
and
called
forth
the
admiration
of
every
one
who
has
been
thrown
into
contact
with
them
a
very
touching
instance
of
these
amiable
feelings
occurred
some
years
ago
and
is
narrated
in
the
westminster
review
for
july
a
poor
girl
who
was
rapidly
sinking
into
a
decline
after
a
short
but
impetuous
course
of
infamy
had
no
means
of
support
but
from
the
continued
exercise
of
her
calling
with
a
mixture
of
kindness
and
conscientiousness
which
may
well
surprise
us
under
the
circumstances
her
companions
in
degradation
resolved
among
themselves
that
as
they
said
at
least
she
should
not
be
compelled
to
die
in
sin
and
contributed
from
their
own
sad
earnings
a
sufficient
sum
to
enable
her
to
pass
her
few
remaining
days
in
comfort
and
repentance
this
is
far
from
being
an
exceptional
case
an
extended
hospital
experience
has
brought
under
our
personal
observation
many
acts
of
real
sympathy
and
kindness
toward
each
other
among
the
prostitute
class
if
one
of
their
number
is
discharged
and
is
unprovided
with
suitable
clothing
they
will
club
their
scanty
resources
to
supply
her
needs
frequently
contributing
articles
they
really
want
themselves
in
any
case
of
serious
sickness
where
prompt
attention
is
required
they
form
most
reliable
nurses
and
will
cheerfully
sacrifice
their
own
rest
at
any
time
to
minister
to
the
sufferer
performing
their
duties
with
the
utmost
care
and
tenderness
their
fidelity
to
each
other
is
strongly
marked
it
is
literally
impossible
in
any
case
where
a
breach
of
discipline
has
occurred
to
find
a
woman
who
will
bear
witness
against
any
of

companions

neither
threats
nor
promises
are
sufficiently

to

these
traits

not

with
any

of
offering
them
as
an
equivalent
to
the

merely
to

it
will
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
say
somewhat
concerning
the
manner
of
life
among
prostitutes
how
they
occupy
the
time
and
what
facilities
they
possess
for
mental
or
bodily
recreation
the
domestic
life
of
a
number
of
women
whose
every
action
is
contrary
to
all
the
rules
of
virtue
who
are
living
in
the
constant
violation
of
the
law
with
a
daily
subsistence
contributed
by
those
whose
folly
or
passions
make
them
visitors
to
their
abode
can
not
but
possess
considerable
interest
to
all
who
have
followed
thus
far
in
this
painful
task
in
entering
upon
the
subject
the
endeavor
will
be
to
give
such
particulars
as
will
enable
the
reader
to
form
satisfactory
conclusions
without
recording
what
would
merely
minister
to
a
prurient
curiosity
the
object
is
to
give
information
as
explicitly
as
possible
without
offending
the
most
sensitive
delicacy
wounding
the
most
refined
feelings
or
unnecessarily
parading
these
poor
women
before
the
public
eye
the
subject
is
invested
with
such
an
array
of
real
and
palpable
horrors
as
to
render
unnecessary
any
endeavor
to
excite
undue
emotion
by
penetrating
the
mysteries
of
the
saturnalia
there
is
a
wide
diversity
among
the
various
grades
of
prostitutes
in
new
york
the
first
class
are
those
who
reside
in
what
are
technically
called
parlor
houses
these
very
seldom
leave
their
abodes
unless
for
the
purpose
of
making
purchases
of
dress
jewelry
or
articles
of
toilette
or
taking
an
afternoon
promenade
on
the
fashionable
side
of
broadway
excepting
when
they
accompany
their
lovers
or
visitors
in
a
ride
or
to
some
public
place
of
amusement
these
utterly
repudiate
the
name
of
and
very
seldom
perform
any
act
in
public
which
would
expose
them
to
reprobation
or
attract
the
attention
of
the
police
they
assume
to
be
and
are
in
fact
the
most
respectable
of
their
class
if
any
respectability
can
be
associated
with
so
vicious
a
course
being
almost
invariably
young
and
handsome
and
always
very
well
dressed
they
pass
through
the
streets
without
their
real
character
being
suspected
by
the
uninitiated
the
houses
in
which
this
class
of
courtesans
reside
are
furnished
with
a
lavish
display
of
luxury
scarcely
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
good
taste
however
and
mostly
exhibiting
a
quantity
of
magnificent
furniture
crowded
together
without
taste
or
judgment
for
the
sake
of
ostentation
the
most
costly
cabinet
and
upholstery
work
is
freely
employed
in
their
decoration
particularly
in
the
rooms
used
as
reception
parlors
large
mirrors
adorn
the
walls
which
are
frequently
handsomely
frescoed
and
gilt
paintings
and
engravings
in
rich
frames
vases
and
statuettes
add
their
charms
carpets
of
luxurious
softness
cover
the
floors
while
sofas
ottomans
and
easy
chairs
abound
music
has
its
representative
in
a
beautiful
pianoforte
upon
which
some
professed
player
is
paid
a
liberal
salary
to
perform
even
the
passages
halls
and
stairways
are
furnished
in
a
similar
style
in
such
an
abode
as
this
probably
dwell
from
three
to
ten
prostitutes
each
paying
weekly
for
her
board
from
ten
to
sixteen
dollars
exclusive
of
extras
which
will
be
noticed
hereafter
their
active
life
comprises
about
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
daily
ranging
from
noon
to
midnight
or
early
morning
their
visitors
are
mostly
of
what
may
be
called
the
aristocratic
class
young
middle
aged
and
even
old
men
of
property
of
all
callings
and
professions
any
one
who
can
command
a
liberal
supply
of
money
is
welcome
but
without
this
indispensable
requisite
his
company
is
not
sought
or
appreciated
none
of
the
disgusting
practices
common
in
houses
of
a
lower
grade
are
met
with
here
there
is
no
palpable
obscenity
and
but
little
that
can
outrage
propriety
of
course
there
is
a
perfect
freedom
of
manner
between
prostitutes
and
visitors
but
so
far
as
the
public
eye
can
penetrate
the
requirements
of
common
decency
are
not
openly
violated
profanity
as
may
naturally
be
expected
exists
to
some
extent
it
is
an
almost
invariable
accompaniment
of
prostitution
but
even
that
is
divested
of
its
grossness
and
is
not
of
frequent
occurrence
there
is
no
or
public
drinking
place
in
the
house
but
it
is
a
general
custom
for
each
visitor
to
invite
his
inamorata
and
her
companions
to
take
champagne
with
him
which
is
supplied
by
the
keeper
of
the
place
at
the
charge
of
three
dollars
a
bottle
as
remarked
in
the
preceding
chapter
excessive
drunkenness
is
rare
both
prostitutes
and
keepers
trying
to
suppress
it
because
an
intoxicated
man
would
be
likely
to
give
them
trouble
damage
their
furniture
and
injure
the
reputation
of
the
house
by
means
of
a
small
aperture
in
the
front
door
covered
by
a
the
candidates
for
admission
can
be
examined
before
entrance
is
given
and
the
door
is
kept
closed
against
any
person
who
is
likely
to
prove
an
annoyance
as
a
natural
consequence
of
their
position
the
women
exert
all
their
powers
of
fascination
by
adopting
the
latest
and
most
superb
fashions
in
dress
and
by
a
very
tasteful
arrangement
of
their
hair
for
which
purpose
a
hair
dresser
visits
them
every
day
charging
each
woman
two
or
three
dollars
a
week
for
his
assistance
besides
these
they
practice
a
thousand
other
artifices
unknown
to
mere
lookers
on
in
order
to
secure
the
favor
of
their
visitors
about
three
fourths
of
the
courtesans
of
this
grade
are
natives
of
the
united
states
and
mostly
from
new
england
or
the
middle
states
some
of
them
are
very
well
educated
accomplished
musicians
and
artists
are
sometimes
found
among
them
while
others
aspire
to
literature
with
the
greater
number
much
elegance
and
refinement
of
manner
or
a
close
observance
of
what
may
be
called
the
conventionalities
of
life
is
seen
their
income
is
large
but
so
are
their
expenses
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
state
that
their
individual
receipts
very
seldom
fall
short
of
fifty
dollars
per
week
from
this
amount
deduct
the
sum
charged
for
their
board
an
additional
fee
which
they
pay
the
proprietress
for
every
visitor
they
entertain
the
expenses
of
perfumery
the
cost
of
their
washing
which
is
all
done
at
their
own
charge
away
from
the
house
and
must
be
considerable
and
the
remainder
will
give
their
expenditure
for
dress
all
are
not
equally
extravagant
some
seem
to
consider
prostitution
a
business
and
act
upon
the
idea
of
saving
as
much
money
as
possible
in
one
case
a
woman
asserted
that
she
had
seven
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank
which
she
had
accumulated
by
prostitution
in
a
few
years
and
her
statement
was
confirmed
by
the
captain
of
police
for
the
district
the
economical
ones
are
generally
shrewd
calculating
who
argue
that
if
they
can
save
enough
during
the
zenith
of
their
charms
to
support
them
when
their
attractions
fail
or
to
help
them
establish
a
house
of
this
description
on
their
own
account
they
are
only
doing
their
duty
others
have
dependent
relatives
whom
they
support
or
illegitimate
children
whom
they
maintain
and
educate
frequently
appropriating
considerable
sums
for
these
purposes
in
nearly
all
of
them
kindness
toward
the
unfortunate
of
their
own
sex
and
grade
is
a
striking
trait
much
as
they
may
quarrel
among
each
other
when
all
are
alike
in
health
let
one
be
visited
with
sickness
or
overcome
by
misfortune
and
as
a
general
rule
their
envy
or
jealousy
is
forgotten
and
they
freely
contribute
to
her
support
their
means
of
amusement
are
limited
when
they
have
no
visitors
they
generally
indulge
in
a
luxurious
indolence
for
any
useful
employment
such
as
even
sewing
or
fancy
needlework
they
have
but
little
inclination
and
their
general
refuge
from
is
found
in
reading
novels
these
are
not
as
would
be
generally
supposed
works
of
lascivious
character
to
these
they
seem
to
have
an
objection
most
probably
because
their
own
experience
has
proved
the
fallacies
of
the
descriptions
of
the
delights
of
love
which
abound
in
such
productions
to
one
source
of
recreation
they
are
extremely
partial
namely
driving
in
carriages
some
few
miles
out
of
town
and
they
frequently
persuade
their
visitors
to
indulge
them
in
these
rural
excursions
they
are
well
acquainted
with
the
most
pleasant
drives
and
know
exactly
where
to
find
quiet
and
retired
hotels
where
all
the
delicacies
of
the
season
can
be
served
in
the
most
approved
style
if
they
can
not
induce
their
friends
to
gratify
them
in
this
manner
they
will
endeavor
to
secure
an
invitation
to
take
luncheon
or
oysters
at
some
fashionable
saloon
dress
gay
life
and
excitement
seem
necessary
to
their
existence
and
amid
all
this
array
of
luxurious
homes
of
splendid
dresses
of
comparative
affluence
the
question
arises
are
they
happy
a
consideration
will
prompt
the
answer
that
they
can
not
be
continued
indulgence
in
their
course
of
life
tends
to
obliterate
the
sense
of
degradation
and
makes
their
career
almost
second
nature
but
even
the
most
confirmed
must
at
times
reflect
the
memory
of
what
they
have
been
the
thought
of
what
they
are
the
dread
of
what
they
must
be
haunt
their
minds
conscience
will
make
itself
heard
many
a
poor
girl
dressed
in
silks
or
satins
gleaming
with
jewelry
and
receiving
with
a
gay
smile
the
lavish
compliments
of
her
friend
is
mentally
racked
with
a
keen
appreciation
of
her
true
position
she
knows
that
the
world
condemns
her
and
her
own
heart
admits
the
justice
of
the
verdict
she
knows
that
he
who
is
so
ostentatiously
parading
his
admiration
regards
her
but
as
a
purchased
instrument
to
minister
to
his
gratification
she
feels
that
she
is
emphatically
alone
in
the
world
and
her
merry
laugh
but
ill
conceals
a
breaking
heart
these
houses
are
generally
kept
by
women
who
have
themselves
passed
through
the
initiatory
course
of
a
prostitute
life
in
some
cases
they
own
the
real
estate
and
furniture
in
others
they
hire
or
lease
the
house
paying
an
exorbitant
rent
often
to
some
wealthy
man
who
considers
himself
a
respectable
member
of
society
and
provide
their
own
furniture
in
other
cases

and

on

at
the
financial
effects
of
the
system
of
prostitution
will
furnish
a
theme
for
some
remarks
hereafter
these
facts
are
quoted
now
to
explain
the
expenses
connected
with
houses
of
course
where
such
outlays
are
incurred
the
receipts
must
correspond
the
following
statement
will
exhibit
the
weekly
receipts
in
a
house
where
ten
boarders
reside
board
for
ten
women
at
per
week
each
fees
for
visitors
say
one
each
day
to
each
woman
each
profit
from
sale
of
one
basket
of
champagne
each
day
weekly
total
this
estimate
does
not
reach
the
daily
average
of
visitors
and
a
more
correct
statement
would
be
board
for
ten
women
at
per
week
each
fees
for
visitors
say
two
each
day
to
each
woman
each
profit
from
sale
of
two
baskets
of
champagne
each
day
weekly
total
taking
the
mean
of
these
two
calculations
will
give
receipts
exceeding
thousand
dollars
per
year
or
five
hundred
dollars
weekly
the
cost
of
maintaining
these
luxurious
establishments
in
addition
to
the
rent
is
considerable
but
still
there
is
a
very
large
excess
this
is
satisfactorily
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
women
who
own
the
houses
in
which
they
conduct
their
traffic
have
almost
without
exception
purchased
them
they
commenced
housekeeping
and
also
that
many
of
them
own
considerable
personal
property
in
addition
to
the
real
estate
one
woman
is
positively
affirmed
to
be
worth
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
many
are
reported
as
worth
sums
ranging
from
fifty
thousand
downward
and
many
more
are
reputed
to
be
rich
but
no
special
amount
mentioned
the
management
of
many
of
the
houses
is
confided
to
a
housekeeper
acting
for
the
principal
who
is
rarely
visible
unless
specially
called
for
and
under
this
housekeeper
are
a
number
of
servants
varying
from
three
to
seven
according
to
the
size
of
the
house
and
the
number
of
boarders
it
accommodates
these
servants
are
almost
invariably
colored
women
and
no
difficulty
is
ever
experienced
in
obtaining
a
full
complement
their
wages
are
liberal
their
perquisites
considerable
and
their
work
light
a
neat
and
breakfast
is
prepared
for
the
lady
boarders
about
eleven
or
twelve
and
their
dinner
is
served
about
five
or
six
as
a
general
rule
these
are
the
only
meals
supplied
them
in
the
course
of
the
day
if
they
require
any
thing
more
they
send
out
for
it
or
persuade
their
visitors
to
escort
them
to
some
saloon
the
proprietors
of
this
class
of
houses
assume
to
be
respectable
women
when
they
are
away
from
the
scenes
of
their
business
an
anecdote
and
a
true
one
has
been
related
of
one
of
them
who
on
a
recent
visit
to
newport
so
effectually
carried
out
her
disguise
as
to
receive
the
escort
of
a
reverend
gentleman
a
of
this
city
to
the
and
elsewhere
with
his
family
he
thinking
her
a
most
amiable
and
deeply
afflicted
widow
some
of
them
have
private
residences
up
town
in
the
quiet
respectable
streets
and
come
to
their
houses
of
prostitution
every
forenoon
returning
at
night
a
portion
of
them
profess
to
be
religious
frequently
attending
some
place
of
worship
the
better
to
preserve
their
mask
naturally
benevolent
as
are
all
women
they
contribute
liberally
to
charitable
objects
and
freely
relieve
any
indigent
persons
who
may
ask
their
assistance
even
in
political
matters
they
have
some
weight
their
resources
and
connections
proving
valuable
to
some
aspirant
for
local
distinction
who
has
promised
them
that
he
will
if
elected
use
all
his
influence
to
protect
them
from
annoyance
toward
the
miserable
women
whose
vice
is
the
source
of
their
wealth
these
proprietors
act
as
interest
dictates
a
girl
who
has
not
the
tact
or
disposition
to
attract
visitors
is
seldom
treated
with
much
consideration
while
one
who
is
successful
receives
more
favors
but
favors
generally
speaking
of
a
nature
to
render
her
subservient
to
their
wishes
such
as
the
loan
of
money
to
purchase
new
and
fashionable
articles
of
dress
a
short
credit
for
her
board
or
some
equivalent
which
will
place
her
under
an
obligation
and
render
it
difficult
for
her
to
leave
the
house
they
are
actuated
in
this
by
a
desire
to
retain
an
attractive
girl
for
in
addition
to
the
actual
cash
payments
she
makes
she
also
possesses
the
power
of
inducing
her
visitors
to
be
liberal
in
their
orders
for
wine
and
the
profit
from
its
sale
about
two
hundred
per
is
an
important
source
of
revenue
the
excessive
demands
made
upon
the
earnings
of
prostitutes
by
these
women
has
been
productive
of
a
serious
social
evil
many
unfortunate
girls
can
not
appreciate
the
advantages
of
leading
a
vicious
life
for
the
benefit
of
a
landlady
and
in
have
hired
apartments
in
some
private
house
so
as
to
secure
their
earnings
for
themselves
this
is
generally
arranged
so
that
two
of
them
engage
a
suite
of
rooms
say
a
parlor
and
two
representing
themselves
as
virtuous
women
governesses
or
seamstresses
and
frequently
as
the
wives
of
sailors
or
of
men
who
are
in
california
or
some
other
distant
land
here
they
either
board
themselves
or
resort
to
some
saloon
and
to
this
lodging
or
to
the
house
of
assignation
which
will
be
noticed
in
due
course
they
introduce
their
visitors
it
is
a
fact
more
than
suspected
that
many
prostitutes
are
living
in
this
manner
in
our
city
it
is
needless
to
enlarge
upon
the
injurious
effects
likely
to
result
therefrom
before
leaving
this
branch
of
the
subject
there
is
another
characteristic
of
keepers
of
these
houses
which
must
be
noticed
namely
an
exaggerated
affection
for
some
man
to
whom
they
are
passionately
attached
some
few
of
them
are
professedly
living
with
their
husbands
but
this
is
an
exception
to
the
ordinary
rule
generally
speaking
they
are
the
mistresses
of
some
persons
upon
whom
they
lavish
all
their
tenderness
and
for
whose
gratification
they
willingly
incur
any
amount
of
expense
some
of
these
individuals
are
men
upon
town
gamblers
or
rowdies
of
the
higher
class
whose
noblest
aspirations
are
satisfied
by
a
liberal
supply
of
money
they
will
readily
ignore
all
social
virtues
for
the
same
consideration
it
is
related
as
a
fact
concerning
a
celebrated
in
the
city
that
when
she
was
residing
in
the
interior
of
the
state
some
years
since
she
became
desperately
enamored
of
a
young
man
whose
friends
discovered
the
connection
they
removed
him
to
the
far
west
undaunted
by
the
dangers
and
difficulties
which
surrounded
her
she
followed
him
and
during
her
journey
through
the
large
towns
had
many
offers
of
protection
from
men
acquainted
with
her
antecedents
true
to
her
affection
she
refused
them
all
and
traced
her
lover
to
the
forests
here
she
remained
with
him
living
in
a
log
hut
deprived
of
many
of
the
necessaries
and
all
of
the
comforts
and
elegances
of
life
for
three
years
at
least
infidelity
to
her
love
can
not
be
charged
against
this
woman
and
is
it
not
a
natural
conclusion
that
a
heart
so
sincere
and
devoted
in
its
attachment
could
have
been
led
to
a
more
virtuous
course
had
a
different
social
feeling
existed
toward
her
and
her
former
transgressions
as
a
general
rule
the
keepers
of
these
houses
will
not
permit
the
boarders
to
have
the
men
whom
they
style
their
lovers
residing
with
them
although
they
allow
them
to
visit
a
constant
residence
is
considered
as
likely
to
engross
too
much
of
the
girl
time
to
the
neglect
of
the
interest
of
the
proprietress
we
come
now
to
the
second
grade
of
prostitutes
and
houses
of
prostitution
many
of
the
women
of
this
rank
are
those
who
made
their
in
houses
but
left
them
when
their
charms
began
to
fade
to
some
extent
they
endeavor
to
carry
out
the
same
rules
of
conduct
which
governed
them
while
there
and
generally
speaking
the
management
of
some
portion
of
the
houses
of
this
grade
assimilates
very
much
with
the
former
the
same
privacy
being
observed
though
in
a
less
expensive
manner
in
others
a
marked
difference
is
perceptible
and
these
will
now
claim
attention
a
longer
continuance
in
the
habits
of
prostitution
and
the
association
with
a
less
aristocratic
class
of
visitors
has
diminished
the
refinement
of
the
women
and
imparted
to
them
coarser
manners
there
is
not
the
same
desire
to
assume
a
virtue
if
they
have
it
not
or
the
same
ambition
to
make
vice
seem
unlike
itself
degradation
has
had
its
effect
upon
them
and
now
that
they
are
reduced
to
a
humbler
sphere
they
feel
more
of
the
world
pressure
and
become
more
daring
and
reckless
in
their
conduct
many
of
the
and
women
frequenting
theatres
are
of
this
class
and
any
one
who
has
ever
come
in
contact
with
them
would
have
found
no
difficulty
in
at
once
assigning
their
true
position
it
is
right
to
say
here
that
many
of
the
managers
of
our
best
theatres
have
abolished
the
third
tier
so
called
and
if
any
improper
woman
visits
them
she
must
do
so
under
the
assumed
garb
of
respectability
and
conduct
herself
accordingly
other
women
in
this
grade
or
rather
this
section
of
the
second
grade
commenced
their
life
of
vice
in
it
and
as
the
natural
tendency
of
prostitution
is
to
depress
instead
of
elevating
its
followers
they
have
very
little
chance
of
ever
rising
beyond
their
present
rank
although
such
instances
do
occasionally
happen
the
keeper
of
a
house
sometimes
consenting
to
receive
a
boarder
from
a
lower
rank
if
she
has
only
recently
commenced
prostitution
and
is
sufficiently
prepossessing
in
manners
and
appearance
for
this
exaltation
a
great
number
of
women
are
found
in
this
class
victims
of
emigrant
or
of
seduction
on
board
ship
during
their
passage
to
this
country
the
houses
are
generally
conducted
in
a
similar
manner
to
those
of
the
first
class
with
this
distinction
that
what
is
costly
luxury
in
the
one
is
replaced
by
tawdry
finery
in
the
other
and
for
expensive
mirrors
and
valuable
paintings
they
substitute
cheaper
ornamentation
their
are
of
much
inferior
finish
they
also
furnish
wine
and
brandy
to
customers
who
wish
for
them
drunkenness
is
more
general
both
with
the
prostitutes
and
their
visitors
and
the
most
revolting
scenes
are
not
uncommon
profanity
is
indulged
in
to
a
considerable
extent
and
in
some
places
seems
the
vernacular
language
the
attempts
at
fascination
made
by
the
women
are
more
excessive
and
frequently
vulgar
to
a
degree
which
while
it
excites
a
smile
also
inspires
disgust
the
general
charge
for
board
here
will
be
from
six
to
ten
dollars
a
week
rarely
reaching
the
latter
figure
when
evening
approaches
if
there
is
little
or
no
company
in
the
house
the
girls
resort
to
the
streets
dressed
in
their
most
attractive
finery
in
the
expectation
of
finding
some
man
whom
they
can
induce
to
accompany
them
home
they
are
seldom
unsuccessful
in
this
search
and
very
frequently
repeat
it
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
others
of
them
visit
the
third
tier
of
such
theatres
as
will
admit
them
and
there
exert
their
charms
to
secure
conquest
intercourse
with
these
women
is
attended
with
considerable
danger
professional
experience
having
shown
many
of
them
to
be
infected
with
syphilis
while
numbers
are
connected
with
dishonest
men
who
would
not
scruple
to
rob
a
stranger
if
any
opportunity
offered
for
the
purpose
such
opportunity
being
not
unfrequently
afforded
by
some
arrangement
of
the
woman
herself
in
such
places
vice
presents
comparatively
few
attractions
and
yet
these
houses
are
numerously
visited
principally
by
travelers
clerks
from
stores
the
higher
class
of
mechanics
some
of
whom
will
spend
in
an
evening
the
earnings
of
a
week
the
women
who
preside
over
these
brothels
are
usually
of
the
and
frequently
of
the
order
the
latter
being
those
who
can
by
their
own
strength
suppress
any
riot
that
may
occur
without
calling
in
aid
from
the
police
and
generally
calculate
to
preserve
a
moderate
decorum
in
their
establishments
their
profits
are
very
large
derived
not
merely
from
the
board
money
and
extras
paid
by
the
women
but
also
from
the
wines
and
liquors
they
sell
they
do
not
endeavor
to
screen
their
own
character
as
do
those
of
the
upper
class
but
openly
acknowledge
what
they
are
and
do
not
hesitate
to
give
their
personal
attention
to
the
business
of
the
place
anxious
to
accumulate
money
as
rapidly
as
possible
they
are
not
very
particular
about
the
means
they
employ
and
although
they
would
not
allow
any
positive
act
of
dishonesty
to
be
performed
toward
a
visitor
while
he
was
in
the
house
on
account
of
the
trouble
to
which
it
might
subsequently
expose
them
yet
they
would
scarcely
consider
it
their
duty
to
warn
him
against
the
proceedings
of
the
men
who
live
as
lovers
with
the
prostitutes
under
their
roofs
the
virtue
of
these
keepers
is
certainly
not
of
a
very
rigid
order
and
their
favored
lovers
are
universally
selected
from
among
men
of
the
same
character
as
themselves
the
meals
provided
for
boarders
are
served
at
about
the
same
hours
as
in
the
fashionable
houses
but
they
lack
that
neatness
and
arrangement
which
a
good
cook
would
give
the
domestic
matters
being
mostly
confided
to
inexperienced
servants
and
frequently
to
some
old
prostitutes
who
are
retained
at
nominal
wages
to
do
as
much
work
as
they
can
and
in
their
own
style
it
has
been
already
stated
that
some
of
the
houses
of
prostitution
are
conducted
in
a
similar
manner
to
those
of
the
first
and
therefore
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
give
any
detailed
account
of
them
which
would
be
a
mere
repetition
of
what
has
been
once
described
the
lower
class
have
been
taken
as
illustrating
the
second
grade
and
consequently
the
account
must
not
be
taken
as
a
sweeping
condemnation
of
the
whole
the
next
or
third
grade
of
prostitutes
and
houses
of
prostitution
may
be
found
very
fully
developed
in
the
first
police
district
among
the
germans
in
the
fourth
district
where
sailors
mostly
resort
and
also
in
the
third
fifth
sixth
and
fourteenth
districts
a
majority
of
the
women
in
these
districts
are
of
foreign
birth
the
largest
proportion
being
irish
and
german
although
rated
as
houses
some
of
them
are
equal
in
all
respects
and
sometimes
superior
in
many
to
houses
of
the
second
class
most
of
the
women
are
young
and
many
of
them
are
very
while
the
houses
particularly
those
kept
by
germans
are
in
general
conducted
very
quietly
even
in
those
places
resorted
to
by
sailors
the
principal
part
of
any
noise
which
may
occur
is
caused
by
the
boisterous
mirth
and
practical
jokes
of
the
visitors
themselves
the
houses
are
in
every
sense
of
the
word
public
places
of
prostitution
and
neither
women
nor
keepers
seek
to
disguise
the
fact
in
any
manner
the
general
argument
seeming
to
be
we
live
by
prostitution
no
matter
who
knows
it
there
are
many
distinctive
features
in
the
several
districts
but
the
first
and
the
fourth
will
be
fair
average
types
of
the
whole
and
these
we
will
notice
briefly
commencing
with
the
german
houses
in
the
first
district
here
drinking
is
openly
carried
on
although
seldom
to
such
an
extent
as
to
cause
absolute
intoxication
there
is
a
public
opening
directly
from
the
street
where
can
be
obtained
lager
beer
and
german
wines
as
well
as
the
usual
liquors
sold
in
this
is
the
of
the
establishment
and
a
stranger
in
the
city
who
might
walk
in
to
get
a
glass
of
lager
beer
without
knowing
the
character
of
the
place
or
being
aware
of
the
signification
of
the
crimson
and
white
curtains
festooned
over
the
windows
would
find
himself
followed
to
the
bar
by
some
german
girl
who
would
ask
him
in
broken
english
if
he
would
treat
her
if
he
feels
inclined
to
gaze
around
him
and
study
human
nature
in
this
phase
he
sees
that
the
room
is
very
clean
a
common
sofa
one
or
two
settees
and
a
number
of
chairs
are
ranged
round
the
walls
there
is
a
small
table
with
some
german
newspapers
upon
it
a
piano
upon
which
the
proprietor
or
his
at
intervals
performs
a
national
melody
and
a
few
prints
or
engravings
complete
its
furniture
two
or
three
girls
are
in
different
parts
of
the
room
engaged
in
knitting
or
sewing
for
german
girls
whether
virtuous
or
prostitute
seem
to
have
a
horror
of
idleness
and
even
in
such
a
place
as
this
are
seldom
seen
without
their
work
every
thing
bears
an
unmistakable
teutonic
appearance
from
the
proprietor
or
the
to
the
mistress
or
madame
as
she
is
generally
called
and
the
women
themselves
all
plainly
tell
their
origin
he
is
surprised
at
the
entire
absence
of
all
those
noisy
elements
generally
considered
inseparable
from
a
house
of
prostitution
he
can
sit
there
and
smoke
his
cigar
in
as
much
peace
as
at
any
hotel
in
the
city
and
if
he
once
tells
a
woman
he
does
not
wish
to
have
any
conversation
with
her
he
will
scarcely
be
annoyed
again
unless
he
makes
the
first
advances
if
he
thinks
proper
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
proprietor
he
will
be
certain
of
a
courteous
reply
and
will
frequently
find
him
an
intelligent
and
communicative
man
finally
concluding
to
resist
the
temptations
around
him
he
leaves
the
place
in
the
most
perfect
security
and
without
the
least
fear
of
being
insulted
the
majority
of
the
girls
here
have
recently
arrived
in
the
united
states
some
have
embraced
this
course
of
life
from
absolute
poverty
and
friendlessness
some
have
followed
it
in
their
own
country
others
have
been
the
victims
of
seduction
and
with
some
the
ruling
motive
seems
to
have
been
a
desire
to
speak
and
be
spoken
to
in
their
native
tongue
their
pecuniary
arrangement
with
the
proprietor
for
there
is
almost
invariably
a
man
at
the
head
of
each
establishment
is
that
they
shall
give
him
one
half
of
all
the
money
they
receive
for
which
he
provides
them
with
board
and
lodging
they
are
not
generally
intemperate
women
the
light
german
wines
being
their
principal
beverage
and
although
they
frequently
indulge
in
profanity
yet
as
it
is
in
their
national
language
it
is
unintelligible
to
those
who
understand
only
english
and
the
annoyance
is
consequently
restricted
they
are
generally
honest
in
fact
it
is
the
testimony
of
those
best
qualified
to
judge
that
there
is
very
seldom
much
disturbance
and
very
rarely
any
dishonesty
practiced
in
this
class
of
brothels
it
can
not
be
said
that
literally
there
is
not
much
noise
for
any
one
who
has
been
in
a
room
where
two
or
three
germans
of
each
sex
were
talking
and
gesticulating
with
their
characteristic
earnestness
will
be
of
opinion
that
they
talked
quite
loud
enough
but
by
is
to
be
understood
quarreling
or
fighting
which
sometimes
occurs
but
not
very
frequently
as
before
remarked
a
man
and
his
wife
are
mostly
the
keepers
of
such
houses
the
man
sometimes
with
a
lad
for
his
assistant
attends
to
the
and
takes
charge
of
the
money
the
wife
does
the
cooking
and
general
and
the
girls
attend
to
their
own
rooms
by
this
division
of
labor
the
work
is
generally
done
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
and
the
expenses
being
light
a
considerable
profit
is
made
there
are
mostly
three
or
four
girls
in
each
house
seldom
exceeding
that
number
and
the
rule
among
is
to
consider
any
girl
an
unprofitable
acquisition
who
does
not
pay
them
about
ten
dollars
a
week
their
rents
are
low
because
they
have
but
little
room
the
basement
of
an
house
is
generally
the
extent
of
their
accommodation
the
front
part
of
this
forms
the
and
the
remainder
is
partitioned
into
very
small
there
is
another
feature
connected
with
german
prostitution
and
exhibited
in
the
same
neighborhood
which
has
already
received
a
cursory
notice
on
a
former
page
namely
their
saltatory
amusements
are
carried
on
more
or
less
in
all
their
houses
of
prostitution
but
in
these
saloons
it
is
considered
a
respectable
business
enterprise
although
the
morality
of
the
establishments
is
at
least
questionable
the
is
a
large
open
apartment
devoid
of
all
furniture
excepting
chairs
or
benches
round
the
walls
the
musical
arrangements
generally
comprise
a
piano
and
violin
and
the
dances
are
national
waltzes
and
polkas
no
charge
is
made
for
admission
and
the
bar
is
the
only
source
of
revenue
the
orchestra
occasionally
appeal
to
the
charitable
for
assistance
and
the
call
is
mostly
responded
to
in
a
liberal
manner
the
business
commences
in
the
evening
and
is
invariably
discontinued
at
midnight
the
places
are
frequented
by
very
few
but
germans
and
order
is
well
maintained
leaving
the
germans
of
the
first
district
the
reader
attention
will
now
be
asked
to
the
brothels
of
the
fourth
police
district
here
the
principal
part
of
the
women
are
of
irish
parentage
some
few
are
natives
of
the
united
states
the
greater
part
of
the
visitors
are
sailors
when
a
succession
of
storms
which
have
driven
vessels
off
the
coast
is
followed
by
a
fair
wind
so
as
to
allow
them
to
enter
the
harbor
in
large
numbers
these
houses
are
crowded
and
for
a
few
days
or
while
the
sailors
wages
last
a
very
extensive
business
is
carried
on
the
as
in
the
case
of
the
german
houses
is
the
and
here
may
be
seen
at
almost
any
hour
of
the
day
a
number
of
sailors
verifying
the
truth
of
the
old
proverb
which
says
they
resemble
two
distinct
animals
in
earning
and
spending
their
money
it
matters
not
who
it
may
be
but
any
one
who
enters
the
room
is
almost
sure
to
be
asked
to
take
a
drink
immediately
and
if
he
remains
in
less
than
five
minutes
somebody
else
will
ask
him
to
take
another
a
sailor
with
cash
in
his
pocket
has
a
decided
antipathy
to
drinking
alone
and
generally
invites
every
one
in
the
room
male
and
female
to
partake
with
him
by
such
a
course
he
very
soon
gets
intoxicated
when
the
girl
whom
he
has
honored
with
his
special
attention
convoys
him
to
bed
and
leaves
him
there
to
sleep
himself
sober
in
these
houses
less
neatness
is
observable
than
in
those
just
noticed
but
they
have
entirely
a
different
class
of
customers
a
german
in
the
midst
of
his
pleasures
likes
to
see
every
thing
neat
and
orderly
about
him
a
sailor
is
not
particular
so
that
his
pleasures
are
unobstructed
a
curious
observer
also
does
not
meet
with
the
same
civility
if
he
comes
to
spend
money
he
is
welcome
if
not
the
landlord
does
not
care
about
his
company
considerable
is
practiced
not
what
may
be
termed
gambling
but
for
amusement
the
stakes
being
seldom
more
than
intoxicating
drinks
for
the
players
there
is
less
noisy
rowdyism
than
might
be
expected
since
the
men
who
generally
cause
such
disturbances
lack
the
courage
to
impose
upon
a
crowd
of
sailors
who
are
always
able
and
willing
to
take
their
own
part
and
resent
any
interference
still
occasional
quarrels
occur
among
the
visitors
themselves
frequently
resulting
in
a
pitched
battle
the
landlord
is
then
called
for
and
his
knowledge
of
his
customers
enables
him
speedily
to
discover
the
aggressor
who
always
happens
to
be
the
man
that
has
the
least
money
and
he
is
forthwith
pushed
into
the
street
without
any
ceremony
as
a
kind
of
to
the
rest
of
the
company
the
landlord
is
a
character
in
his
way
he
is
a
man
who
has
been
to
sea
himself
for
no
one
else
would
be
deemed
fit
to
keep
a
house
where
sailors
resort
and
is
usually
a
large
powerful
man
by
the
freemasonry
of
the
craft
and
by
freely
joining
his
visitors
whenever
they
ask
him
to
drink
and
occasionally
treating
them
in
return
he
is
sure
of
their
custom
until
their
wages
are
all
spent
and
they
are
obliged
to
go
to
sea
again
the
women
in
these
houses
use
liquor
very
freely
but
they
are
not
permitted
to
get
drunk
in
the
daytime
if
the
landlord
observes
any
symptom
of
intoxication
he
gives
them
water
instead
of
gin
the
next
time
they
are
asked
to
drink
as
he
knows
very
well
his
prospects
for
business
would
be
injured
unless
the
girls
were
kept
sufficiently
sober
to
be
on
the
watch
for
contingencies
or
as
he
phrases
it
to
look
out
for
chances
in
some
of
these
houses
it
is
the
rule
that
all
the
money
received
by
the
girls
is
to
be
given
to
the
landlord
who
provides
them
with
clothing
and
necessaries
but
in
others
a
fixed
rate
of
board
six
or
eight
dollars
a
week
is
paid
and
the
women
retain
the
surplus
in
either
case
it
is
a
very
profitable
business
particularly
where
many
girls
are
kept
in
one
house
that
we
visited
in
the
fourth
district
the
keeper
informed
us
that
his
expenses
amounted
to
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
weekly
and
of
course
some
estimate
can
be
made
from
this
as
to
the
amount
of
business
he
transacted
the
in
this
neighborhood
are
not
conducted
on
the
platonic
principles
of
the
germans
they
are
in
fact
so
many
accessories
to
prostitution
and
many
scenes
there
witnessed
will
not
permit
description
the
women
residing
in
the
house
are
there
dressed
in
the
most
tawdry
finery
they
can
command
many
of
them
assuming
the
bloomer
costume
the
band
consists
of
a
violin
a
banjo
and
a
tambourine
and
whatever
is
wanting
in
musical
ability
is
adequately
supplied
by
vigorous
execution
the
bar
is
very
liberally
patronized
and
before
midnight
drunkenness
is
the
rule
and
sobriety
the
exception
passing
now
to
the
fourth
grade
of
this
vice
we
find
prostitution
in
a
most
repulsive
form
the
women
themselves
diseased
and
dirty
the
houses
redolent
of
bad
rum
the
prostitutes
are
the
refuse
of
the
other
classes
who
have
fallen
through
the
successive
gradations
on
account
of
disease
and
drunkenness
or
they
are
some
of
those
children
of
iniquity
who
born
in
scenes
of
vice
and
squalid
misery
know
nothing
of
a
virtuous
or
happy
course
of
life
destiny
seems
from
their
birth
to
have
intended
them
for
vagrants
and
has
planted
them
so
low
in
the
moral
scale
that
they
can
scarcely
hope
to
rise
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
a
specification
of
the
localities
of
these
houses
any
one
who
has
been
through
the
purlieus
of
new
york
city
must
have
observed
some
of
them
and
it
will
be
quite
sufficient
to
glance
at
a
few
of
their
peculiarities
they
are
generally
kept
by
an
old
prostitute
who
gathers
around
her
some
of
the
most
debased
of
her
class
takes
a
cheap
basement
wherever
she
can
obtain
possession
of
one
suited
to
her
purpose
erects
a
small
bar
furnished
with
three
or
four
bottles
of
the
commonest
liquor
she
can
procure
partitions
off
one
or
two
small
hovels
of
and
forthwith
begins
housekeeping
her
arrangements
are
about
as
extensive
as
her
preparations
she
seldom
professes
to
board
the
girls
generally
making
a
charge
for
every
visitor
they
entertain
and
giving
them
the
privilege
of
cooking
any
thing
they
want
these
dens
are
largely
patronized
by
the
vilest
of
the
male
sex
the
petty
thieves
who
hang
around
the
public
markets
stealing
from
the
wagons
or
who
haunt
the
doors
of
grocery
stores
and
abstract
whatever
they
can
reach
as
they
find
them
convenient
places
of
concealment
and
can
frequently
dispose
of
their
booty
by
means
of
the
women
another
class
of
visitors
consists
of
the
lowest
order
of
rowdies
who
assume
a
free
license
to
perpetrate
any
mischief
they
please
because
there
is
no
one
to
interfere
with
them
a
fatal
case
of
this
nature
which
occurred
but
a
few
months
since
will
be
fresh
in
the
recollection
of
all
citizens
it
is
dangerous
for
a
stranger
to
enter
a
place
of
this
description
for
if
he
does
not
get
his
pocket
picked
by
the
one
he
will
most
probably
be
assaulted
by
the
other
class
of
visitors
upon
such
establishments
the
police
are
compelled
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
and
although
they
have
no
power
to
enter
them
except
some
actual
necessity
calls
for
their
services
yet
they
frequently
induce
a
neighbor
to
make
a
complaint
against
the
keepers
for
maintaining
a
disorderly
house
and
then
duly
armed
with
a
warrant
they
enter
and
arrest
every
one
found
on
the
premises
the
of
such
an
experiment
at
housekeeping
as
this
is
very
frequently
a
commitment
for
vagrancy
to
blackwell
island
the
character
of
the
place
will
be
a
sufficient
proof
that
syphilis
abounds
there
and
its
dangers
must
be
added
to
those
already
enumerated
the
divisions
thus
made
are
presumed
to
be
accurate
as
far
as
the
distinctive
characters
of
the
various
grades
are
concerned
but
the
lines
of
demarkation
are
of
course
arbitrary
any
attempt
to
classify
so
large
a
social
evil
must
from
its
very
nature
be
incomplete
and
in
this
case
farther
experience
or
a
more
extended
inquiry
would
very
probably
warrant
an
alteration
in
the
arrangement
but
there
is
another
class
of
whom
a
few
words
must
be
said
namely
those
truly
wretched
beings
the
outcasts
of
the
outcasts
in
many
cases
destitute
of
home
or
shelter
diseased
starving
and
afflicted
with
an
insatiable
thirst
for
ardent
spirits
they
present
most
ghastly
and
spectacles
retaining
scarcely
any
vestiges
of
humanity
these
wretched
beings
can
be
found
clustered
round
the
bars
of
in
low
neighborhoods
begging
for
the
price
of
a
glass
of
gin
much
of
their
time
is
spent
in
the
prisons
on
island
from
which
they
are
no
sooner
released
than
they
return
to
their
old
haunts
and
habits
they
can
scarcely
be
called
prostitutes
for
their
aspect
is
so
disgustingly
hideous
that
all
feminine
characteristics
are
blotted
out
and
thoroughly
sensual
and
animalized
must
he
be
who
could
accept
their
favors
they
are
in
every
sense
of
the
word
outcasts
compelled
for
the
short
time
they
may
be
in
the
city
and
this
is
seldom
more
than
a
few
days
at
once
to
eke
out
a
wretched
existence
by
stealing
or
begging
frequently
so
miserable
that
they
gladly
hail
the
day
on
which
they
are
returned
to
prison
they
present
subjects
for
mournful
consideration
and
the
reflection
that
they
are
experiencing
the
degradation
to
which
every
prostitute
in
the
city
is
rapidly
tending
should
be
a
powerful
argument
in
favor
of
any
remedial
measures
which
can
be
devised
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
the
frail
women
of
new
york
and
prevent
them
from
falling
so
far
below
humanity
houses
of
assignation
every
resident
of
new
york
is
aware
of
the
existence
of
houses
used
especially
as
places
for
the
meeting
of
the
sexes
with
a
view
to
illicit
intercourse
but
so
carefully
have
all
particulars
respecting
them
been
concealed
from
the
public
gaze
that
very
little
more
than
this
mere
fact
is
generally
known
particularly
with
reference
to
those
of
a
higher
grade
secrecy
is
necessary
to
their
continuance
and
essential
for
the
maintenance
of
the
social
position
of
their
patrons
the
most
exclusive
are
generally
situated
in
the
quietest
and
most
respectable
portion
of
the
city
they
are
fitted
up
neatly
and
even
luxuriously
but
without
any
extravagant
or
gaudy
display
their
arrangements
of
course
do
not
require
reception
or
sitting
rooms
and
the
whole
care
bestowed
upon
them
is
lavished
on
the
the
appointments
of
which
contain
every
possible
comfort
and
convenience
the
keepers
of
this
class
of
houses
are
generally
very
shrewd
quiet
cautious
women
who
never
seek
to
penetrate
into
any
engagements
made
by
their
visitors
who
never
know
any
person
that
enters
their
house
and
from
whom
it
is
impossible
to
obtain
information
by
any
means
in
fact
it
has
been
said
that
the
keepers
and
servants
around
these
places
have
neither
eyes
ears
nor
tongues
money
is
confessedly
their
object
and
as
they
receive
liberal
pay
dictates
quietness
because
if
they
adopted
any
other
course
their
houses
would
inevitably
become
known
to
the
public
which
would
be
an
effectual
barrier
against
visitors
and
result
in
an
entire
loss
of
their
customers
consequently
if
a
liberal
bribe
could
ever
induce
treachery
their
shrewdness
enables
them
to
discern
that
such
an
act
would
at
once
and
forever
close
their
establishments
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
as
the
intrinsic
value
of
these
houses
as
places
for
meeting
depends
upon
the
secrecy
and
selectness
with
which
they
are
operated
in
order
to
carry
out
this
principle
fully
arrangements
are
made
with
much
precision
two
parties
are
not
allowed
to
meet
casually
in
the
halls
or
staircases
the
keeper
maintains
a
strict
watch
in
order
that
ingress
and
egress
may
be
free
and
uninterrupted
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
desire
to
make
money
on
her
side
and
the
fascination
of
illicit
passion
on
the
part
of
her
visitors
conjointly
tend
to
insure
more
actual
secrecy
than
could
be
obtained
by
any
system
of
oaths
or
discipline
in
some
of
the
most
exclusive
the
system
is
carried
to
such
an
extreme
that
no
accommodation
will
be
afforded
to
parties
unless
the
gentleman
has
been
previously
introduced
to
the
proprietress
and
his
character
for
secrecy
and
integrity
vouched
for
by
some
person
with
whom
she
is
acquainted
this
rule
is
adopted
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
house
becoming
known
as
a
place
of
assignation
to
any
one
who
might
use
his
knowledge
to
the
prejudice
of
the
keeper
or
her
visitors
no
public
women
reside
in
these
houses
nor
would
they
be
admitted
under
any
pretext
as
such
a
course
would
attract
attention
and
defeat
the
purposes
contemplated
many
of
them
are
open
for
months
without
the
knowledge
of
the
neighbors
or
of
the
police
of
the
district
as
visitors
very
rarely
enter
or
leave
together
and
to
prevent
any
delay
the
outer
door
is
generally
kept
unlocked
so
that
persons
pass
immediately
into
the
hall
where
a
second
door
with
a
bell
attached
is
generally
found
the
business
of
these
houses
is
done
mainly
during
the
promenade
hours
of
broadway
say
from
eleven
or
twelve
to
four
or
five
the
visitors
are
confined
to
the
upper
walks
of
life
the
men
being
of
all
sorts
of
business
and
the
women
exclusively
from
our
fashionable
society
if
the
mysterious
personal
advertisements
in
the
daily
papers
could
be
understood
by
the
outside
world
it
would
be
seen
that
appointments
are
not
unfrequently
made
through
their
agency
arrangements
for
a
meeting
are
generally
made
with
the
keepers
in
advance
and
at
the
designated
time
the
parties
arrive
from
different
directions
and
proceed
direct
to
the
room
which
has
been
already
selected
if
they
wish
it
they
can
obtain
wine
or
refreshments
by
ringing
a
bell
in
their
apartment
a
majority
of
the
females
who
visit
these
places
can
scarcely
be
called
prostitutes
notwithstanding
their
undeniable
fall
from
virtue
they
sin
but
with
one
individual
and
that
in
many
cases
from
positive
affection
and
in
others
from
the
desire
of
sexual
gratification
whatever
may
be
the
motive
it
does
not
concern
the
keeper
of
the
house
whose
only
business
is
to
receive
the
rent
of
her
room
which
ranges
from
two
or
three
dollars
upward
to
any
amount
that
policy
or
the
desire
to
insure
secrecy
may
dictate
doubtless
very
few
of
the
visitors
regard
money
in
their
negotiations
females
are
very
frequently
closely
veiled
when
they
enter
the
house
so
that
their
features
can
not
be
recognized
as
has
been
illustrated
in
trials
for
divorce
in
this
city
especially
if
the
prior
arrangements
for
the
meeting
have
been
made
by
the
gentlemen
if
on
the
other
hand
the
lady
takes
the
preliminary
steps
she
can
scarcely
be
unknown
to
the
proprietress
in
whose
keeping
she
consequently
places
her
character
the
unsuspecting
moral
men
of
new
york
will
scarcely
credit
these
facts
but
men
of
the
world
know
that
such
meetings
and
places
for
meeting
are
not
uncommon
it
may
be
objected
that
the
exposure
of
these
mysteries
imparts
information
which
may
lead
the
uninitiated
into
similar
practices
it
is
believed
that
the
information
here
given
is
not
sufficiently
definite
for
this
end
and
certainly
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
design
of
this
work
than
to
aid
an
immoral
purpose
but
it
is
a
duty
to
record
the
general
facts
in
order
that
our
citizens
may
be
aware
of
the
dangers
that
abound
on
every
side
and
particularly
is
it
necessary
because
many
of
the
female
visitors
are
married
women
who
take
advantage
of
the
absence
of
their
husbands
at
business
a
question
will
arise
who
are
the
women
that
keep
these
houses
that
they
can
not
have
lived
as
common
prostitutes
or
been
the
keepers
of
houses
of
prostitution
is
evident
in
the
first
place
the
acquaintances
they
would
have
made
in
either
of
those
avocations
would
preclude
the
possibility
of
their
maintaining
the
inviolable
secrecy
necessary
in
a
house
of
assignation
and
again
no
female
would
enter
a
place
of
this
description
the
keeper
of
which
would
be
likely
to
betray
her
it
is
apprehended
that
some
of
these
houses
originate
in
the
following
manner
in
fact
we
know
of
more
than
one
that
did
commence
so
a
female
engaged
in
an
intrigue
which
she
can
not
carry
out
at
her
own
residence
and
desiring
a
place
of
security
for
her
meetings
has
an
acquaintance
with
some
shrewd
woman
possibly
one
who
works
for
her
as
seamstress
or
in
some
other
capacity
whom
she
makes
partially
a
confidant
she
tells
her
that
she
is
desirous
of
seeing
a
gentleman
whom
for
some
particular
reason
she
can
not
invite
to
her
house
and
asks
if
she
will
accommodate
her
with
a
room
in
which
the
interview
can
take
place
it
is
not
likely
that
a
person
who
felt
under
any
obligation
to
her
employer
would
refuse
such
a
request
especially
for
so
simple
a
purpose
as
a
short
conversation
the
meeting
accordingly
takes
place
and
a
handsome
present
is
made
her
it
is
frequently
repeated
until
she
becomes
suspicious
and
finally
satisfied
that
these
interviews
are
for
the
purpose
of
sexual
intercourse
by
this
time
it
has
become
a
question
of
with
her
she
argues
that
if
she
refuses
to
extend
any
future
accommodation
she
will
lose
not
only
a
considerable
income
from
the
presents
but
also
all
employment
from
the
lady
she
knows
that
by
allowing
such
meetings
she
realizes
considerably
more
than
she
can
procure
by
her
daily
labor
and
is
generally
strong
enough
to
overcome
her
scruples
she
goes
on
extending
her
accommodations
and
enlarging
the
circle
of
her
visitors
until
she
becomes
mistress
of
a
select
house
of
assignation
which
will
be
always
liberally
patronized
so
long
as
her
power
of
maintaining
the
requisite
secrecy
remains
unimpeached
some
of
these
women
are
from
distant
cities
entire
strangers
in
new
york
except
to
their
immediate
customers
if
they
are
widows
who
have
children
these
are
invariably
educated
away
from
home
from
the
privacy
observed
it
is
very
difficult
to
estimate
their
receipts
which
must
be
large
they
sometimes
degenerate
into
keepers
of
houses
of
public
prostitution
and
then
become
dangerous
members
of
society
on
account
of
the
secrets
which
have
been
intrusted
to
them
probably
some
of
our
citizens
might
be
enabled
to
give
more
particulars
of
these
houses
than
are
here
collected
what
has
been
stated
is
gathered
from
authentic
sources
and
may
command
implicit
belief
indeed
so
trustworthy
is
the
authority
that
it
may
be
confidently
asserted
that
even
fifth
avenue
and
union
square
are
not
exempt
from
these
resorts
such
houses
must
be
regarded
as
the
connecting
link
between
the
licentious
excesses
of
the
capitals
of
europe
and
this
city
of
the
new
world
they
are
dangerous
from
their
secrecy
and
exclusiveness
as
yet
they
are
rare
and
it
speaks
well
for
the
morals
of
our
upper
classes
that
they
are
so
it
shows
that
the
majority
of
people
in
the
higher
walks
of
life
are
untainted
but
the
course
of
deterioration
has
commenced
will
not
american
good
sense
and
american
morality
check
this
base
imitation
of
a
foreign
custom
the
recently
avowed
sentiments
or
rather
the
resuscitation
of
sentiments
which
were
proclaimed
years
ago
respecting
the
obligations
of
marriage
and
the
theory
of
free
love
have
doubtless
increased
the
patrons
of
houses
of
assignation
among
our
fashionable
people
or
weak
romantic
heads
made
giddy
by
the
sudden
acquisition
of
wealth
for
the
last
fifteen
years
a
loose
code
of
morals
has
been
promulgated
among
us
the
foreign
apostles
of
which
many
of
them
pretending
to
nobility
but
being
in
truth
mere
adventurers
have
visited
us
and
by
them
and
through
their
influence
many
intrigues
have
originated
a
spice
of
romance
in
the
american
character
has
induced
many
to
join
this
movement
in
search
of
adventure
while
a
portion
of
our
female
society
are
ardent
admirers
of
every
thing
foreign
be
it
a
lord
or
a
lace
veil
and
these
delight
in
an
intrigue
because
it
is
an
exotic
the
facilities
of
communication
with
europe
are
now
so
great
that
american
travel
on
that
continent
is
largely
on
the
increase
and
perhaps
there
are
at
this
time
in
the
cities
of
continental
europe
more
representatives
of
our
society
than
of
any
other
nation
many
of
our
people
go
there
with
the
laudable
desire
to
improve
their
minds
by
general
culture
or
for
the
study
of
particular
branches
of
science
or
art
but
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
some
come
back
to
our
shores
with
ideas
calculated
to
be
any
thing
but
beneficial
to
their
native
country
in
a
social
or
moral
point
of
view
the
sons
of
our
staid
and
solid
men
go
to
the
capital
of
the
french
empire
to
study
medicine
apart
from
the
impropriety
of
this
course
when
there
are
the
same
facilities
for
study
here
where
a
few
seconds
of
lightning
intercourse
will
place
them
in
immediate
communication
with
their
friends
instead
of
their
being
separated
four
thousand
miles
from
parents
and
guardians
does
the
end
justify
the
means
what
course
do
these
young
men
frequently
pursue
unable
to
speak
the
language
intelligibly
they
resort
to
the
acquaintance
of
a
in
order
to
study
in
her
company
the
language
they
acquire
by
this
means
is
at
best
a
vulgar
but
they
also
obtain
a
knowledge
of
intrigue
entirely
incompatible
with
the
simplicity
and
purity
of
our
republican
institutions
a
species
of
male
and
female
diplomacy
foreign
to
the
character
of
our
people
young
ladies
too
when
they
return
from
a
foreign
tour
are
more
fascinated
with
the
charms
and
successes
of
the
favored
mistress
of
some
european
prince
or
potentate
than
benefited
by
the
useful
solid
lessons
of
travel
with
them
as
with
the
others
it
is
all
superficiality
superficial
when
they
started
superficial
while
traveling
they
are
still
more
superficial
when
they
return
there
are
always
people
in
this
country
who
will
ape
foreign
manners
and
to
this
cause
must
be
assigned
the
gradual
approximation
of
our
fashionable
society
to
the
vices
of
the
european
capitals
their
ladylike
and
gentlemanlike
frailties
their
genteel
peccadilloes
and
affectations
the
effects
of
foreign
travel
upon
such
persons
can
not
but
be
injurious
it
demands
a
clear
head
and
a
sound
heart
to
decide
between
the
vicious
frivolities
and
the
positive
good
submitted
to
their
notice
and
with
the
class
mentioned
it
requires
but
little
judgment
to
know
which
will
first
attract
them
they
must
see
lord
a
or
count
b
no
matter
what
valuable
opportunities
for
instruction
they
miss
they
must
become
in
the
observances
of
courts
and
the
manners
of
courtiers
no
matter
what
else
they
leave
undone
as
remedial
measures
for
another
evil
are
elsewhere
spoken
of
this
may
be
an
appropriate
place
to
suggest
for
profound
consideration
whether
it
would
not
be
a
wise
policy
to
adopt
some
preventive
system
for
this
evil
we
might
establish
a
phrenological
and
psychological
bureau
armed
with
full
powers
to
examine
all
persons
desiring
to
travel
so
as
to
ascertain
whether
they
may
safely
make
the
grand
tour
and
have
sufficient
strength
of
intellect
and
firmness
of
principle
to
resist
the
vitiating
influences
and
examples
which
will
surround
them
there
so
that
they
may
return
only
with
a
knowledge
of
the
good
and
valuable
lessons
taught
but
the
evils
of
foreign
manners
and
customs
are
not
imported
solely
by
the
traveling
class
of
our
own
community
the
political
turmoils
of
europe
in
the
last
eight
or
ten
years
have
thrown
among
us
numerous
who
have
been
reared
in
the
of
intrigue
and
who
styling
themselves
depend
upon
our
unexampled
prosperity
the
increase
of
our
wealth
the
improvement
of
our
country
and
our
known
predilections
for
foreigners
to
enable
them
to
make
a
living
and
also
to
establish
the
same
state
of
morals
and
manners
existing
in
the
cities
whence
they
came
the
united
states
are
now
the
great
for
art
which
with
science
music
and
poetry
aids
to
improve
the
mind
at
the
same
time
these
bring
with
them
an
excessive
devotion
to
fashion
both
in
dress
and
manners
as
the
dress
and
the
lascivious
waltz
which
are
so
decidedly
positive
degenerations
from
our
normal
state
that
none
but
the
most
superficial
will
ever
copy
that
we
are
rapidly
introducing
many
of
the
most
absurd
follies
and
worst
vices
of
europe
is
a
patent
fact
almost
every
one
can
specify
acts
now
tolerated
in
respectable
families
which
so
far
from
being
permitted
fifteen
years
ago
would
have
been
thought
by
our
plain
parents
amply
sufficient
to
warrant
the
exclusion
of
the
offender
from
the
domestic
circle
and
it
is
an
equally
conspicuous
fact
that
our
social
morality
is
deteriorating
in
a
direct
ratio
to
the
introduction
of
these
habits
every
day
makes
the
system
of
new
york
more
like
that
of
the
most
depraved
capitals
of
continental
europe
and
it
remains
for
the
good
innate
sense
of
the
bulk
of
the
american
people
to
say
how
much
farther
we
shall
proceed
in
this
frivolous
intriguing
and
despicable
manner
of
living
or
whether
they
will
not
strive
to
perpetuate
the
stern
morality
of
the
puritan
fathers
our
great
moral
safeguard
so
far
and
thus
put
an
effectual
barrier
against
the
inroads
of
a
torrent
which
must
undermine
our
whole
social
fabric
and
finally
crush
us
beneath
the
ruins
the
second
class
of
are
to
a
great
extent
private
but
not
so
rigidly
exclusive
as
the
others
their
furniture
is
of
the
same
luxurious
style
but
of
a
more
gaudy
character
generally
the
same
routine
is
observed
in
regard
to
entrance
as
in
those
of
the
first
class
the
principal
portion
of
the
females
who
resort
to
them
are
married
women
most
of
whom
are
from
the
upper
classes
whose
sexual
passions
are
not
gratified
elsewhere
or
who
resort
to
this
means
to
obtain
more
money
to
expend
in
dress
kept
mistresses
residing
with
their
lovers
as
husband
and
wife
in
hotels
or
whose
attachment
is
not
strong
enough
to
keep
them
faithful
to
one
man
occasionally
the
best
class
of
or
or
females
whose
occupations
such
as
milliners
artificial
florists
lead
them
into
contact
with
the
fashionable
classes
it
is
told
on
good
authority
that
there
are
husbands
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
their
wives
visit
such
places
and
who
live
wholly
or
in
part
upon
money
earned
in
this
way
these
cases
are
not
supposed
to
be
numerous
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
for
the
credit
of
our
national
character
that
the
number
will
become
still
smaller
a
few
prostitutes
of
the
upper
grades
sometimes
visit
this
class
of
houses
they
are
known
to
the
keeper
and
she
encourages
them
for
the
following
reason
an
habitué
of
the
place
will
make
an
appointment
to
visit
it
at
a
specified
time
and
he
tells
the
keeper
he
would
wish
to
meet
a
female
there
at
the
appointed
day
his
wishes
are
gratified
the
keeper
having
acted
as
negotiator
with
one
of
the
girls
mentioned
more
wine
is
consumed
in
these
houses
than
in
the
strictly
select
ones
probably
from
the
different
class
who
frequent
them
the
houses
of
assignation
are
not
situated
in
such
select
parts
of
the
city
as
are
the
other
two
classes
some
of
them
are
managed
with
much
privacy
and
seclusion
while
others
are
simply
houses
of
public
prostitution
on
a
large
scale
their
principal
female
patrons
are
those
prostitutes
who
have
rebelled
against
the
exorbitant
charges
made
by
keepers
of
fashionable
houses
and
who
resort
to
prostitution
to
augment
their
income
many
of
these
live
some
distance
up
town
and
any
one
who
is
journeying
downward
in
the
after
part
of
the
day
may
see
numbers
of
them
going
to
these
places
in
the
cars
and
stages
this
is
another
imitation
of
the
french
and
english
systems
very
little
disguise
is
attempted
about
these
houses
each
has
a
parlor
or
where
a
man
can
have
a
bottle
of
wine
and
one
or
two
of
the
girls
named
will
join
him
of
course
many
couples
visit
there
but
a
large
number
of
men
go
alone
knowing
that
there
are
always
women
in
the
house
fast
young
men
about
town
are
in
the
habit
of
keeping
their
mistresses
at
these
houses
as
more
economical
than
boarding
with
them
at
hotels
considerable
disease
is
propagated
in
such
places
a
contingency
from
which
the
first
and
second
classes
are
almost
entirely
exempt
business
is
generally
over
here
in
three
or
four
hours
commencing
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
but
it
is
unquestionably
a
source
of
considerable
revenue
to
the
keeper
particularly
in
those
cases
where
she
acts
as
procuress
since
in
addition
to
the
rent
of
the
room
which
the
man
pays
she
always
receives
a
from
the
woman
there
is
another
or
fourth
class
of
to
which
the
commonest
portion
of
take
their
company
and
these
may
be
emphatically
described
by
an
old
saying
cheap
and
nasty
dirty
and
insufficient
accommodations
are
the
equivalents
for
low
prices
and
such
places
are
in
the
general
estimation
of
connoiseurs
very
and
despicable
notwithstanding
this
they
thrive
and
multiply
from
which
it
may
safely
be
inferred
that
they
are
profitable
in
a
business
point
of
view
repulsive
as
they
may
be
in
their
features
and
arrangements
some
of
them
are
ingeniously
arranged
with
a
view
to
robbery
and
are
called
the
plan
adopted
is
somewhat
as
follows
some
man
generally
a
countryman
not
very
well
informed
in
the
tricks
of
the
metropolis
meets
with
a
prostitute
and
agrees
to
her
to
an
she
is
in
league
with
the
panel
thieves
and
therefore
introduces
her
victim
to
one
of
their
rooms
the
apartment
seldom
contains
more
furniture
than
a
bed
and
a
chair
or
lounge
with
the
floor
covered
with
a
thick
carpet
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
the
man
himself
locks
the
door
by
which
he
enters
and
when
undressing
naturally
throws
his
clothes
upon
the
chair
or
lounge
the
bedstead
is
placed
so
that
the
feet
come
toward
the
only
door
in
the
room
with
one
side
against
the
wall
and
the
head
and
other
side
hung
with
curtains
which
the
woman
carefully
draws
as
soon
as
the
man
lies
down
by
her
side
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
of
course
concealed
by
the
drapery
from
any
one
occupying
it
is
another
door
which
forms
the
secret
entrance
it
is
so
adroitly
arranged
and
so
neatly
covered
with
paper
the
same
as
the
walls
that
no
one
would
suspect
its
existence
the
hinges
and
fastening
on
the
outside
are
oiled
so
that
no
noise
can
be
perceived
when
it
is
opened
and
the
operator
steals
with
step
over
the
carpet
and
quietly
examines
the
clothes
without
alarming
the
unsuspecting
stranger
the
thief
completes
his
inspection
appropriates
as
much
as
he
thinks
proper
and
the
temporary
occupant
of
the
apartment
resumes
his
clothes
and
prepares
to
leave
if
his
suspicions
are
excited
by
the
circumstance
that
his
wallet
looks
less
plethoric
than
it
did
and
an
examination
reveals
that
some
of
its
contents
are
missing
he
knows
not
how
to
account
for
it
he
is
perfectly
certain
that
no
one
has
entered
that
room
while
he
was
there
and
if
he
has
visited
much
before
meeting
the
girl
he
concludes
that
he
must
have
lost
some
of
his
money
in
his
career
and
that
the
only
way
is
to
take
the
loss
contentedly
and
avoid

in

sometimes
the
loser
has
not
enough
philosophy
for
this
and
if
he
can
be
certain
that
his

was
right
when
he
entered
the

will
call
in
the

and
thus
expose

of

this
is
comparatively
a
rare
case
as
most

would
rather
submit
to
a
pecuniary
loss
than
encounter
the
trouble
and
exposure
attending

it
will
be
necessary
to

this

must
include
the

in

the

propagated
through

the

represent
about

this
is
allowing
an
increase
of
twenty
per
cent
during

in
consequence
of
the

panic
of
last
autumn
and
the
resulting
paralysis
of

and
suffering
of
the
laboring
community
in
the
progress
of
this
investigation
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
consult
those
whose
acquaintance
with
the
details
of
city
life
would
entitle
their
opinions
to
confidence
as
to
the
actual
number
of

within

much
information
obtained

september
george
matsell
chief
of

dear
sir
during
the
last
twenty
years
various
estimates
have
been
made
by
different
persons
foreigners
and
natives
interested
and
not
interested
as
to
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
the
city
of
new
york
it
is
generally
supposed
that
they
reach
the
large
number
of
or
thirty
thousand
you
sir
have
been
at
the
head
of
the
police
department
of
the
city
for
the
past
fifteen
years
while
previous
to
that
time
you
acted
if
i
mistake
not
as
one
of
the
police
justices
of
the
city
i
presume
therefore
that
you
have
a
considerable
knowledge
of
prostitution
as
it
exists
here
and
consequently
can
give
a
very
correct
opinion
as
to
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
new
york
city
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
if
at
your
earliest
leisure
and
in
any
form
most
convenient
to
yourself
you
will
state
what
you
believe
to
be
the
total
number
of
prostitutes
now
in
the
city
it
is
proper
to
add
that
with
your
permission
i
intend
to
publish
this
letter
with
your
answer
in
the
report
on
prostitution
which
i
am
preparing
and
shall
soon
have
the
honor
to
lay
before
the
public
yours
respectfully

office

doctor
william
sanger
dear
sir
i
received
your
letter
asking
me
to
express
in
writing
my
estimate
of
the
whole
number
of
known
public
prostitutes
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
the
absence
of
any
law
compelling
the
registering
of
public
prostitutes
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
testify
with
accuracy
to
the
exact
number
of
such
persons
in
the
city
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
stating
that
in
my
opinion
they
do
not
number
over
five
thousand
persons
if
indeed
they
reach
so
high
a
figure
having
been
engaged
in
public
life
for
many
years
my
opinion
is
based
on
the
observations
made
by
me
from
time
to
time
and
from
various
official
reports
made
to
me
you
are
at
liberty
to
make
such
use
of
this
answer
to
your
interrogatory
as
you
may
deem
proper
very
respectfully
yours
geo
matsell
chief
of
police
this
communication
in
addition
to
the
facts
gleaned
from
other
sources
was
amply
sufficient
to
warrant
the
conclusion
that
the
known
public
prostitutes
in
new
york
did
not
exceed
five
thousand
in
number
at
the
close
of
the
year
then
ensued
the
summer
with
its
artificial
inflation
that
false
prosperity
which
excites
unbounded
hopes
and
stimulates
to
measureless
extravagance
followed
by
the
revulsion
and
panic
of
the
fall
and
winter
trade
was
literally
dead
operatives
never
too
well
paid
were
threatened
with
starvation
females
particularly
felt
the
rigid
pressure
of
the
times
in
many
families
the
embarrassments
of
the
fathers
compelled
a
reduction
of
the
servants
employed
and
a
large
number
of
domestics
were
added
to
the
aggregate
of
that
class
already
out
of
situations
the
occupations
of
the
army
of
seamstresses
milliners
and
tailoresses
were
suspended
and
their
struggles
for
bread
were
merged
in
the
general
cry
for
labor
it
was
in
short
a
trying
time
alike
for
the
sufferers
and
the
observers
but
one
resort
seemed
available
the
poor
workless
houseless
foodless
woman
must
have
recourse
to
prostitution
as
a
means
of
preserving
life
as
usual
in
any
time
of
great
excitement
surmise
ran
actually
wild
as
to
the
extent
of
the
consequences
and
extravagant
theories
abounded
one
gentleman
actually
stating
in
a
public
meeting
that
a
thousand
virtuous
girls
were
becoming
prostitutes
every
week
through
sheer
starvation
an
assertion
so
appalling
as
this
is
its
own
refutation
it
assumes
that
one
woman
in
every
hundred
of
the
female
population
of
new
york
city
between
the
ages
of
fifteen
and
thirty
years
became
a
prostitute
every
week
and
therefore
during
the
six
months
of
fall
and
winter
thousand
women
one
fourth
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
ages
named
one
in
every
four
of
all
the
women
under
middle
age
would
have
been
forced
into
vice
the
practice
of
jumping
at
conclusions
upon
serious
matters
like
this
is
much
to
be
reprehended
an
exaggerated
statement
made
in
the
fervor
of
enthusiasm
while
advocating
a
benevolent
object
must
always
recoil
to
the
injury
of
the
cause
it
is
intended
to
promote
it
will
be
necessary
only
to
consider
for
a
moment
the
financial
condition
of
new
york
to
be
convinced
that
such
an
increase
of
prostitution
was
impossible
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
number
of
abandoned
women
is
regulated
by
the
demand
or
that
the
only
inducement
which
could
lead
virtuous
girls
to
the
course
alleged
must
have
been
the
necessity
to
earn
money
for
subsistence
but
this
necessity
to
earn
money
was
felt
as
strongly
by
men
as
by
women
the
revulsion
for
a
time
left
a
large
portion
of
the
community
without
resources
merchants
manufacturers
and
found
their
receipts
inadequate
to
meet
their
expenditures
commercial
clerks
salesmen
and
agents
were
discharged
mechanics
in
every
branch
were
without
work
and
consequently
without
wages
merchants
from
other
parts
of
the
country
had
no
money
to
meet
their
liabilities
or
make
fresh
purchases
and
therefore
did
not
visit
the
city
as
usual
these
causes
combined
to
reduce
the
business
of
houses
of
prostitution
and
instead
of
large
accessions
to
the
ranks
of
courtesans
many
of
this
very
class
were
forced
to
seek
a
refuge
in
the
public
charitable
institutions
hence
arose
the
increase
in
the
denizens
of
blackwell
island
where
hospital
and
penitentiary
were
alike
some
of
the
places
vacated
by
these
recipients
of
eleemosynary
aid
were
doubtless
filled
by
new
recruits
but
the
supposition
that
a
thousand
were
added
every
week
would
imply
a
change
in
the
whole
every
six
weeks
or
a
change
nearly
five
times
completed
during
the
fall
and
winter
that
female
virtue
was
yielded
in
many
instances
can
not
unfortunately
be
doubted
but
the
sufferers
did
not
become
public
prostitutes
poor
creatures
they
surrendered
themselves
unwillingly
to
some
temporary
acquaintance
probably
in
gratitude
for
assistance
already
rendered
or
anticipating
aid
to
be
afforded
there
is
something
truly
melancholy
in
the
consideration
that
bread
had
to
be
purchased
at
such
a
price
that
the
only
alternative
lay
between
voluntary
dishonor
and
killing
indigence
it
is
but
charity
to
conclude
that
the
woman
who
thus
acted
if
her
subsequent
course
was
not
a
continuous
life
of
abandonment
was
impelled
by
the
stern
necessity
of
the
times
rather
than
induced
by
a
laxity
of
moral
feeling
unchaste
as
she
must
be
admitted
she
can
scarcely
be
deemed
a
prostitute
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
word
it
would
be
foolish
to
deny
all
increase
of
prostitution
since
the
date
of
the
correspondence
just
transcribed
the
population
of
new
york
is
now
some
thirty
or
forty
thousand
more
than
at
that
time
and
female
degradation
has
extended
as
a
natural
consequence
relying
upon
the
estimate
of
five
thousand
as
correct
at
the
time
made
the
subsequent
augmentation
of
inhabitants
would
suppose
an
addition
of
about
three
hundred
prostitutes
but
to
take
the
widest
scope
and
assume
that
the
debasement
required
by
hunger
degenerated
into
a
habit
of
confirmed
vice
it
may
be
admitted
that
the
number
of
abandoned
women
in
new
york
has
increased
from
five
thousand
in
to
six
thousand
in
this
is
a
very
liberal
estimate
and
the
total
assigned
is
certainly
not
too
small
how
much
it
may
be
in
excess
can
not
be
said
with
precision
but
in
an
argument
of
this
nature
it
is
safer
to
err
in
the
direction
of
overstating
an
evil
than
to
be
lulled
into
false
security
by
too
flattering
a
representation
the
known
public
prostitutes
of
new
york
are
thus
presumed
to
amount
to
six
thousand
at
the
present
day
but
to
this
number
exceptions
might
be
taken
to
secure
farther
accuracy
additional
evidence
was
sought
in
the

the
assistance

none

where
no

prostitution
is

no

to

where

but
when

they
locate
in

to

i
presume
there
are
fifty
young
women
and

women
some
of
whom
pass
for
respectable

who
are
in
the
habit
of
going
across

of

it
is

to

that
there
are
in

at
least
five
hundred
prostitutes
of
all
ages

grades
and
colors
inspector
hartt
district
says
in
answer

this
being
a
hard
question
to
answer
the
answer
must
be
taken
as
entirely
supposed
to
be
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
inspector
curry
district
says
in
answer
to
question
probably
two
or
three
hundred
but
this
is
mere
we
know
there
are
a
great
many
some
of
them
very
young
those
reports
from
which
no
extracts
have
been
made
consist
simply
of
figures
without
any
remarks
and
are
given
fully
in
the
synopsis
it
will
be
observed
that
all
the
officers
quoted
give
the
number
of
prostitutes
more
as
a
conjecture
than
a
certainty
and
although
their
avocations
would
lead
them
to
know
most
of
the
disreputable
women
in
their
several
districts
none
of
them
assume
to
be
so
thoroughly
informed
as
to
be
enabled
to
answer
positively
to
the
numbers
they
give
must
be
added
the
floating
prostitute
population
of
city
and
district
prisons
hospitals
and
penitentiary
which
varies
from
one
thousand
to
two
thousand
and
may
be
taken
at
an
average
of
one
thousand
five
hundred
this
with
those
known
to
the
police
makes
a
total
of
and
the
balance
of
six
hundred
and
required
to
raise
the
number
to
six
thousand
is
but
a
moderate
allowance
for
those
who
have
escaped
the
eyes
of
the
officers
when
taking
the
census
as
before
remarked
it
is
better
to
overestimate
than
underestimate
the
abandoned
women
of
the
city
but
to
this
number
are
to
be
added
those
whose
calling
is
so
effectually
disguised
as
to
prevent
its
being
known
those
who
practice
prostitution
in
addition
to
some
legitimate
occupation
and
those
who
resort
to
illicit
pleasures
for
the
indulgence
of
their
passions
to
obtain
information
on
these
points
some
supplementary
questions
were
addressed
to
the
captains
of
police
at
the
commencement
of
this
investigation
in
and
their
replies
are
now
submitted
the
first
inquiry
was
how
many
houses
of
assignation
are
there
in
your
district
it
was
known
when
this
interrogatory
was
propounded
that
the
secrecy
maintained
in
these
places
would
in
some
instances
baffle
the
keenness
not
often
at
fault
of
our
shrewdest
police
officers
and
no
surprise
was
felt
when
their
replies
indicated
that
only
of
these
houses
were
known
to
them
reliable
information
from
other
sources
led
to
the
conviction
that
this
was
understated
the
investigation
of
may
fixes
the
number
at
which
is
also
too
low
and
we
shall
be
perfectly
justified
in
estimating
the
number
of
houses
of
assignation
in
new
york
at
one
hundred
the
next
question
was
what
to
the
best
of
your
belief
are
the
average
number
of
visitors
to
such
houses
every
hours
the
replies
gave
an
average
of
six
couples
to
each
house
every
day
or
an
aggregate
of
six
hundred
women
every
hours
this
was
followed
by
the
query
are
all
the
females
who
visit
these
houses
of
assignation
known
public
prostitutes
if
not
of
what
class
do
you
suppose
or
know
them
to
be
from
the
replies
it
was
found
that
about
two
fifths
were
known
as
prostitutes
the
remainder
being
sewing
or
shop
girls
kept
mistresses
widows
and
some
married
women
again
state
your
opinion
as
to
how
many
kept
mistresses
there
are
in
your
district
in
the
districts
two
hundred
and
were
ascertained
and
the
presumption
was
that
there
were
more
the
number
may
be
safely
taken
at
four
hundred
the
next
question
was
how
many
women
to
the
best
of
your
belief
and
that
you
have
not
previously
examined
are
there
in
your
district
that
obtain
a
livelihood
in
whole
or
in
part
by
prostitution
to
this
the
numbers
are
stated
upon
belief
for
the
nature
of
the
question
precludes
any
positive
information
as
about
four
hundred
can
you
form
an
opinion
as
to
how
many
women
in
your
district
who
are
not
impelled
by
necessity
prostitute
themselves
to
gratify
their
passions
no
definite
answers
were
obtained
to
this
the
general
suppositions
ranging
from
one
third
to
one
fourth
of
those
who
were
not
recognized
as
public
prostitutes
to
what
extent
in
your
opinion
is
prostitution
carried
on
in
the
tenant
houses
in
your
district
it
is
generally
admitted
that
there
is
some
but
no
calculation
can
be
made
with
any
accuracy
many
of
what
may
be
called
private
prostitutes
live
in
this
class
of
houses
but
their
visitors
would
be
taken
to
houses
of
assignation
where
the
numbers
are
included
in
the
estimate
given
it
is
believed
that
there
are
many
women
who
follow
prostitution
living
in
nearly
all
the
respectable
portions
of
the
city
they
singly
or
in
couples
hire
a
suite
of
rooms
and
under
the
garb
of
honest
labor
sewing
pass
as
respectable
among
those
living
near
them
it
is
also
known
that
such
as
these
are
the
great
frequenters
of
houses
of
assignation
how
many
such
women
to
the
best
of
your
belief
are
there
in
your
district
the
officers
reply
that
they
have
ascertained
that
there
are
about
two
hundred
but
they
believe
there
are
many
more
thus
much
for
the
information
we
have
been
enabled
to
collect
there
are
six
hundred
women
who
visit
these
houses
of
assignation
every
day
of
whom
two
fifths
are
known
as
public
prostitutes
and
the
remainder
are
of
other
classes
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
known
prostitutes
visit
such
houses
at
least
once
every
hours
which
leaves
over
three
hundred
visits
daily
for
the
others
kept
mistresses
or
married
women
who
resort
there
for
the
gratification
of
their
passions
probably
amount
to
one
hundred
per
day
it
can
scarcely
be
supposed
that
such
visit
houses
of
assignation
more
than
once
a
week
as
a
general
rule
while
the
others
sewing
or
shop
girls
who
resort
there
to
augment
their
income
would
probably
take
this
step
two
or
three
times
per
week
which
would
bring
their
number
to
about
four
hundred
it
thus
appears
that
a
very
fair
estimate
of
the
total
number
of
frail
women
who
are
now
in
new
york
may
be
stated
as
follows
known
public
prostitutes
women
who
visit
houses
of
assignation
for
sexual
gratification
women
who
visit
houses
of
assignation
to
augment
their
income
one
half
the
number
of
kept
mistresses
assuming
the
other
half
to
be
included
in
those
who
visit
houses
of
assignation
total
it
will
be
seen
that
to
arrive
at
this
conclusion
all
are
included
who
are
suspected
to
be
lost
to
virtue
although
of
the
number
who
visit
houses
of
assignation
for
sexual
gratification
many
are
guiltless
of
promiscuous
intercourse
this
total
number
falls
very
far
short
of
the
estimates
made
at
different
times
by
various
persons
that
there
are
from
twenty
to
thirty
thousand
prostitutes
in
new
york
city
such
rash
conclusions
hastily
formed
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
sometimes
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
wish
is
father
to
the
thought
must
give
place
to
the
results
of
a
careful
and
searching
investigation
made
for
this
special
purpose
the
of
examination
in
the
city
rendered
it
incumbent
on
those
having
it
in
charge
to
approximate
to
the
facts
and
is
itself
a
sufficient
guarantee
of
correctness
if
it
were
possible
to
parade
the
six
thousand
known
public
prostitutes
in
one
procession
they
would
make
a
much
larger
demonstration
than
the
mere
printed
words
six
thousand
suggest
to
the
reader
it
requires
a
man
who
is
in
the
habit
of
seeing
large
congregations
of
persons
to
comprehend
at
a
glance
the
aggregate
implied
in
this
statement
place
this
number
of
women
in
line
side
by
side
and
if
each
was
allowed
only
inches
of
room
they
would
extend
two
miles
and
four
hundred
and
eighty
yards
let
them
march
up
broadway
in
single
file
and
allow
each
woman
inches
and
that
is
as
little
room
as
possible
considering
the
required
space
for
locomotion
and
they
would
reach
from
the
city
hall
to
fortieth
street
or
let
them
all
ride
in
the
ordinary
city
stages
which
carry
twelve
passengers
each
and
it
would
be
necessary
to
charter
five
hundred
omnibuses
for
their
conveyance
these
simple
illustrations
will
make
the
extent
of
the
vice
plain
to
many
who
could
form
but
an
inadequate
idea
from
the
mere
figures
yet
the
estimate
will
probably
appear
low
to
those
residents
of
the
city
who
have
been
accustomed
to
believe
new
york
reeking
with
prostitution
in
every
hole
and
corner
while
it
will
seem
excessively
large
to
readers
residing
in
the
country
for
the
information
of
the
latter
it
may
be
remarked
that
vicious
as
manhattan
island
unquestionably
is
much
as
there
may
be
in
it
to
need
reform
in
this
matter
of
prostitution
it
must
not
bear
all
the
blame
of
these
six
thousand
women
for
although
they
certainly
reside
in
it
a
very
large
number
of
their
visitors
do
not
dwell
there
brooklyn
the
villages
on
long
island
fort
hamilton
new
utrecht
flushing

others
jersey
city
hoboken
hudson
staten
island
morrisania
fordham
contain
numbers
of
people
who
transact
their
daily
business
in
new
york
but
reside
in
those
places
in
very
few
of
these
localities
are
any
prostitutes
to
be
found
nor
would
they
be
encouraged
therein
while
new
york
is
so
close
at
hand
and
so
easy
of
access
again
the
strangers
flocking
into
this
city
from
all
parts
of
the
world
average
from
five
to
twenty
thousand
and
upward
every
day
and
they
must
relieve
it
of
some
part
of
this
obloquy
the
population
of
new
york
at
the
last
census
was
officially
stated
to
be
in
round
numbers
and
the
proportionate
increase
for
three
years
to
the
present
time
will
bring
it
very
near
if
illicit
intercourse
here
were
carried
on
only
by
permanent
residents
its
proportion
of
public
prostitutes
would
be
one
to
every
one
hundred
and
seventeen
of
the
inhabitants
but
the
calculation
must
include
the
denizens
of
the
places
already
enumerated
and
adding
for
them
and
the
number
of
strangers
constantly
visiting
the
city
we
have
a
total
of
persons
making
the
proportion
of
prostitutes
only
one
in
every
two
hundred
including
men
women
and
children
it
is
desirable
however
to
ascertain
what
proportion
courtesans
bear
to
the
classes
who
patronize
them
and
the
census
shows
that
males
above
the
age
of
fifteen
form
about
per
cent
of
the
population
a
wider
range
might
have
been
taken
as
it
is
notorious
that
many
boys
under
fifteen
years
old
especially
among
the
lower
classes
practice
the
vice
but
assuming
that
to
be
the
standard
there
is
one
prostitute
to
every
adult
males
certainly
not
a
large
proportion
in
a
commercial
and
maritime
city
it
is
impossible
to
form
any
idea
of
the
proportion
of
male
inhabitants
and
visitors
who
encourage
houses
of
prostitution
marriage
is
not
always
a
check
to
indiscriminate
intercourse
and
professions
of
religion
are
often
violated
for
illicit
gratification
still
there
are
a
vast
number
whom
these
obligations
bind
and
if
they
could
be
exactly
ascertained
this
would
make
a
corresponding
difference
in
the
proportions
as
the
case
now
is
new
york
city
stands
somewhat
in
the
position
of
a
seduced
woman
and
has
to
endure
all
the
odium
attached
to
the
number
of
prostitutes
residing
within
her
limits
while
her
neighbors
and
strangers
who
largely
participate
in
the
offense
are
like
seducers
and
escape
all
censure
saying
how
virtuous
is
our
town
or
village
compared
with
that
sink
of
iniquity
new
york
it
has
been
already
stated
what
the
effect
would
be
if
all
visitors
to
new
york
were
moral
men
and
although
the
remark
need
not
be
repeated
its
appositeness
is
apparent
from
the
prostitutes
within
our
borders
emanates
the
plague
of
syphilis
and
when
the
number
of
abandoned
women
is
considered
in
conjunction
with
the
certainty
that
each
of
them
is
liable
at
any
moment
to
contract
and
extend
the
malady
when
the
probabilities
of
such
extension
are
viewed
in
connection
with
the
acknowledged
fact
that
each
prostitute
in
new
york
receives
from
one
to
ten
visitors
every
day
instances
are
known
where
the
maximum
exceeds
and
sometimes
doubles
the
highest
number
here
given
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
of
the
danger
of
infection
nor
any
surprise
that
the
average
life
of
prostitutes
is
only
four
years
the
actual
extent
of
venereal
disease
must
be
the
first
point
of
inquiry
and
here
the
records
of
public
institutions
are
of
great
service
the
hospitals
on
blackwell
island
under
the
charge
of
the
governors
of
the
present
the
largest
array
of
cases
the
principal
part
of
which
were
treated
in
the
penitentiary
now
island
hospital
the
number
of
these
cases
was
in
upon
these
facts
the
writer
of
these
pages
remarked
in
his
annual
report
to
the
board
of
governors
for
the
ratio
of
venereal
disease
on
the
gross
number
of
patients
treated
in
was
per
cent
the
ratio
of
the
same
disease
in
was
showing
an
increase
in
the
year
of
the
ratio
of
venereal
disease
on
the
gross
number
of
patients
treated
during
was
showing
an
increase
in
as
compared
with
of
or
an
increase
as
compared
with
of
this
steady
increase
per
cent
in
one
year
and
per
cent
in
the
next
or
per
cent
within
two
years
may
be
considered
an
incontrovertible
proof
of
the
progress
of
this
malady
in
the
city
of
new
york
the
fact
that
the
people
regard
the
penitentiary
hospital
as
a
an
institution
to
which
nothing
but
the
direst
necessity
will
compel
them
to
apply
justifies
the
conclusion
that
the
cases
treated
are
but
a
fraction
of
the
disease
existing
and
its
increase
here
may
be
taken
as
a
sure
indication
of
a
corresponding
or
larger
increase
among
the
general
population
again
on
the
same
subject
in
in
my
last
report
i
took
the
opportunity
to
submit
to
your
honorable
board
facts
proving
the
increase
of
venereal
disease
and
i
then
gave
the
ratio
of
that
malady
on
the
gross
number
of
patients
treated
as
per
cent
in
the
year
the
ratio
was
per
cent
but
this
reduction
of
per
cent
must
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
other
diseases
much
beyond
the
general
average
have
been
treated
in
the
last
year
so
that
a
larger
number
of
venereal
cases
will
yet
show
a
smaller
percentage
the
cases
of
phthisis
pulmonalis
consumption
which
have
advanced
from
in
to
in
sufficiently
explain
that
the
decrease
of
venereal
affections
is
apparent
and
not
real
an
investigation
beyond
the
statistics
upon
which
these
remarks
were
based
and
including
the
penitentiary
hospital
and
penitentiary
had
shown
that
of
the
total
number
admitted
to
these
several
institutions
per
cent
had
suffered
or
were
suffering
from
venereal
disease
at
the
time
the
inquiry
was
made

this

on

subject

the

of
the
cases
of
this
malady
to
the
gross
number
of

treated

in
per

by
the
term
primary
syphilis
readers
will
understand
the
commencement
of
the
disease
or
symptoms
which
are
the
direct
consequence
of
an
impure
connection
in
contradistinction
to
secondary
syphilis
which
is
the
comparatively
remote
result
of
infection
never
appearing
until
after
the
primary
symptoms
are
well
developed
and
frequently
not
until
all
traces
of
them
are
removed
he
will
thus
see
that
every
case
of
primary
syphilis
is
in
itself
a
proof
of
recent
intercourse
with
a
diseased
person
these
cases
then
have
increased
from
per
cent
in
to
per
cent
in
and
per
cent
in
the
remarks
recently
quoted
explain
how
cases
in
make
a
smaller
percentage
than
in
the
fact
of
this
increase
compels
us
to
but
one
conclusion
and
that
is
a
very
important
and
suggestive
one
namely
that
with
prostitutes
in
was
attended
with
nearly
twice
the
risk
of
infection
incurred
in
and
of
course
the
health
of
abandoned
women
has
deteriorated
in
the
same
this
is
not
said
with
any
wish
on
the
part
of
the
writer
to
be
considered
an
alarmist
the
facts
are
those
which
have
come
under
his
personal
observation
the
inference
is
but
a
plain
and
natural
deduction
but
the
hospital
although
the
chief
is
not
the
only
institution
on
blackwell
island
where
patients
are
treated
for
venereal
disease
the
and
penitentiary
have
each
a
share
of
sufferers
from
this
malady
to
what
extent
will
be
shown
by
the
annexed
table

under

of

of

professedly

to
venereal
cases
by
a
report
from
the
medical
board
of
that
institution
which
will
be
found
in
the
next
chapter
it
is
seen
that
they
estimate
not
far
from
per
cent
of
the
inmates
of
bellevue
hospital
are
admitted
for
affections
which
have
their
origin
remotely
in
venereal
disease
these
data
are
sufficient
to
fix
the
numbers
thus
treated
as
follows
year
total
number
per
cent
for
of
patients
venereal
cases
in
regard
to
the
nursery
hospital
on
randall
island
it
is
stated
by
whittlesey
the
resident
physician
that
nine
tenths
of
all
diseases
treated
in
this
hospital
during
the
past
five
years
have
been
of
constitutional
origin
and
for
the
most
part
hereditary
the
exact
proportion
which
hereditary
syphilis
bears
to
this
sum
of
constitutional
depravity
can
not
be
stated
with
accuracy
it
is
an
estimate
far
within
the
bounds
of
probability
to
assume
that
one
half
of
the
diseases
referred
to
by
whittlesey
are
complicated
with
or
by
syphilitic
taint
and
the
numbers
in
the
nursery
hospital
will
therefore
stand
as
follows

for
of

the

there
are
other

such
as
luke

vincent

the

but
they
are
of
recent
origin
and
their

will
not
form
an
element
in
this
calculation
the
dispensaries
of
the
city
relieve
yearly
a
large
amount
of
sickness
in
the
new

dispensary

the
cases
of

are

this
gives
an
average
of
about
three

of
all
the

treated
the
northern
dispensary
waverley

does
not
publish
any
detailed
report
of
the

treated
and
to
make
an
estimate
it
will
be
necessary
to
assume
that
the
proportion
is
the

as
in
the

namely
three
per

by

the

the

will
be
made
as

to

treated
in

at

city
from
the

university
medical

the
following

has
been
obtained
it
is
undoubtedly
much
too
low
an
estimate
and
assuming
that
the
practice
of
the
others
is
of
the
same
extent
we
have
as
the
venereal

treated
in
the
three
colleges
as
many
of
the
patrons
of
new

houses
of
ill
fame
reside
out
of
the

some
further
information
must
be
sought
beyond
our
own
limits
without
professing
to
inquire
into
the
public
health
in
all
the
suburbs
previously
enumerated
it
will
be
sufficient
to
take
the
reports
of
the
superintendents
of
the
poor
of
king
county
to
ascertain
what
amount
of
syphilitic
infection
has
been
treated
at
the
public
cost
in
brooklyn
and
its
environs
the
reports
of
doctor
thomas
turner
resident

of
the

show
the
following

or
about
ten
per

on
the
total

treated
in
the
brooklyn

the
cases
of

received
and
treated
were
in
to
may
it
has
been
already
stated
that
sailors
are
great
patrons
of
prostitutes
and
to
obtain
any
true
statement
of
venereal
disease
among
them
some
estimate
respecting
this
class
must
be
made
for
this
purpose
the
reports
of
clarkson
moffatt
of
the
seaman
retreat
staten
island
new
york
are
available
the
number
of
cases
treated
in
the
several
years
is
here
given
to
april
this
is
nearly
per
cent
on
the
gross
number
treated
this
concludes
the
published
reports
of
charitable
institutions
and
the
question
next
arises
what
amount
of
syphilis
is
treated
by
physicians
in
private
practice
it
is
impossible
to
obtain
any
reliable
data
upon
this
head
the
medical
board
of
bellevue
hospital
composed
of
some
of
the
leading
members
of
the
profession
in
the
city
state
that
they
are
unable
to
say
what
proportion
of
the
practice
among
regular
and
qualified
physicians
in
this
city
is
derived
from
the
treatment
of
venereal
diseases
but
they
know
it
is
large
and
that
many
receive
more
from
this
source
than
from
all
other
sources
together
there
are
also
a
very
large
number
of
advertising
pretenders
who
offer
their
services
for
the
treatment
of
secret
diseases
and
many
whose
main
business
is
derived
from
a
similar
source
together
with
an
infinity
of
patent
medicines
announced
and
sold
as
specifics
for
all
venereal
maladies
upon
the
simple
commercial
principle
of
supply
and
demand
these
are
so
many
proofs
of
the
extent
of
the
evil
they
profess
to
relieve
should
the
number
of
cases
of
venereal
disease
treated
in
private
practice
by
qualified
physicians
and
by
advertisers
added
to
the
number
of
patients
who
supply
themselves
with
patent
or
other
medicines
from
be
regarded
as
equal
to
the
aggregate
of
those
treated
in
public
institutions
the
estimate
could
not
be
deemed
extravagant
the
design
is
now
to
ascertain
how
much
venereal
disease
exists
in
new
york
at
the
present
time
and
to
do
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
recapitulate
the
information
already
given

total
medical

and
those
acquainted
with
the

need
not
be
reminded
that
the
general
system
of
record
in
hospitals
includes
only
what
may
be
called
the
prominent
malady
thus
if
a
man
were
admitted
with
a
broken
limb
it
would
be
registered
as
a
fracture
and
if
the
same
man
were
suffering
indirectly
from
syphilis
at
the
same
time
no
entry
would
be
made
thereof
although
the
physician
rendered
him
every
professional
assistance
toward
its
cure
it
is
estimated
that
in
this
manner
a
large
number
of
the
cases
of
venereal
disease
treated
in
all
public
institutions
except
such
as
make
a
specialty
of
those
maladies
is
never
recorded
elsewhere
than
on
the
private
of
the
attending
physicians
more
particularly
is
this
the
rule
in
institutions
supported
wholly
or
in
part
by
voluntary
contributions
their
benevolent
directors
have
not
yet
outlived
the
prejudice
which
formerly
held
it
almost
as
disgraceful
to
treat
as
to
contract
syphilis
some
of
the
spirit
which
drove
the
unhappy
men
and
women
so
afflicted
from
civilized
life
to
perish
in
the
fields
or
woods
as
in
london
edinburgh
and
paris
during
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
and
at
a
later
period
drew
from
the
papal
government
a
bull
recognizing
the
affliction
as
a
direct
punishment
from
the
almighty
for
the
sin
of
incontinence
still
survives
in
the
present
generation
the
trustees
of
more
than
one
of
the
dispensaries
in
new
york
have
directed
their
medical
officers
not
to
prescribe
for
such
complaints
and
a
hospital
in
a
sister
city
which
receives
a
yearly
grant
from
public
funds
has
in
its
printed
rules
and
regulations
no
person
having
or
shall
be
admitted
as
a
charity
patient
some
remarks
are
made
hereafter
upon
this
course
and
the
facts
are
mentioned
now
to
explain
why
many
cases
of
venereal
disease
never
appear
upon
the
reports
of
institutions
where
patients
are
treated
practically
such
prohibitions
are
a
dead
letter
no
physician
of
a
public
institution
applied
to
by
a
poor
wretch
suffering
from
syphilis
could
pass
him
by
without
attempting
to
relieve
let
the
orders
of
the
board
of
trustees
be
what
they
may
his
mission
is
simply
to
apply
the
aid
of
science
and
skill
to
the
alleviation
of
any
ailment
which
may
be
presented
to
his
notice
and
his
appreciation
of
the
responsibility
of
his
office
is
too
keen
to
allow
him
to
refuse
the
prayer
of
such
an
applicant
hence
arises
the
circumstance
that
the
case
is
treated
under
some
other
name
if
then
the
cases
recorded
are
but
two
thirds
of
the
aggregate
the
numbers
stand
thus
cases
recorded
in
public
institutions
cases
not
recorded
total
cases
in
the
year
in
public
institutions
the
difficulty
of
forming
an
opinion
as
to
the
extent
of
venereal
disease
treated
in
private
practice
has
been
already
mentioned
in
the
absence
of
all
information
collateral
circumstances
form
the
only
guide
to
a
conclusion
the
amount
is
unquestionably
very
large
so
large
that
if
its
full
magnitude
could
be
discovered
and
announced
every
reader
must
be
astonished
the
first
consideration
to
support
this
view
may
be
found
in
the
army
of
advertising
empirics
who
make
it
a
source
of
revenue
each
of
these
men
must
have
numerous
patients
he
could
not
keep
up
his
business
without
them
any
practical
advertiser
knows
that
to
insert
an
announcement
of
some
twenty
or
thirty
lines
every
day
in
at
least
two
daily
papers
to
repeat
the
same
in
weekly
journals
and
in
addition
to
this
to
post
handbills
on
the
corner
of
every
street
and
employ
men
or
boys
to
deliver
them
to
passengers
at
docks
ferry
landings
and
depôts
can
not
be
done
without
a
considerable
outlay
whatever
its
prospective
advantages
may
be
no
one
supposes
these
charlatans
to
be
actuated
by
pure
disinterested
benevolence
they
crowd
the
columns
of
our
journals
and
insult
us
with
their
printed
announcements
in
the
public
thoroughfares
simply
because
it
pays
these
means
obtain
them
customers
and
whenever
this
result
ceases
the
announcements
will
be
discontinued
while
they
appear
there
is
positive
proof
that
their
issuers
are
gathering
patronage
the
number
of
patent
medicines
always
in
the
market
for
the
cure
of
secret
diseases
and
which
the
vendors
announce
can
be
sent
any
distance
securely
packed
and
safe
from
observation
affords
a
corroboration
they
are
made
and
sold
as
a
business
speculation
when
their
reputation
diminishes
and
the
public
become
doubtful
if
all
the
virtues
of
the
are
comprised
in
a
single
bottle
of
red
drop
or
unfortunate
friend
the
manufacture
will
soon
stop
and
the
inventors
will
resort
to
some
other
employment
for
their
capital
the
extent
to
which
advertising
empirics
and
patent
medicines
are
flourishing
is
an
undeniable
proof
of
the
prevalence
of
the
maladies
they
professedly
relieve
the
legitimate
business
of
affords
another
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
beyond
the
regular
nostrums
almost
every
druggist
in
the
city
sells
large
quantities
of
medicine
for
the
cure
of
venereal
disease
sometimes
a
man
will
candidly
tell
the
storekeeper
that
he
has
contracted
disease
and
ask
him
to
make
up
something
to
cure
it
at
other
times
a
prescription
which
has
been
efficacious
in
a
former
attack
will
be
presented
or
the
sufferer
has
taken
counsel
among
his
friends
and
companions
and
obtained
some
infallible
recipe
from
one
of
them
in
short
there
are
so
many
different
means
taken
by
persons
who
have
contracted
disease
that
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
the
various
methods
in
which
the
aid
of
the
may
be
invoked
there
are
many
traditional
recipes
which
can
be
used
without
the
necessity
of
purchasing
ingredients
of
a
druggist
one
favorite
remedy
among
the
lower
classes
is
pine
knot
bitters
bottles
of
this
preparation
are
kept
for
sale
in
liquor
stores
particularly
in
those
neighborhoods
where
prostitutes
most
do
congregate
another
reason
may
be
submitted
why
a
large
amount
of
venereal
disease
must
be
treated
privately
many
of
the
victims
are
men
who
move
in
a
respectable
sphere
of
society
and
have
probably
been
led
to
the
act
which
resulted
so
disastrously
in
a
moment
of
uncontrollable
passion
their
social
position
would
be
irreparably
damaged
should
they
enter
a
public
hospital
and
the
desire
to
retain
their
forces
them
to
secrecy
even
if
the
natural
repugnance
of
every
man
to
the
former
course
did
not
exist
it
is
vain
to
deny
that
while
medical
institutions
designed
for
the
public
good
are
so
managed
as
to
inflict
a
disgrace
upon
their
inmates
their
benefits
are
circumscribed
and
will
never
be
accepted
by
any
but
the
poor
unfortunates
who
have
no
other
means
of
obtaining
relief
in
the
case
of
syphilis
this
is
particularly
to
be
regretted
from
the
nature
of
the
disease
every
day
it
is
neglected
it
becomes
in
a
tenfold
degree
more
aggravated
and
entails
proportionate
misery
in
after
life
if
it
be
assumed
that
the
private
cases
of
venereal
disease
equal
in
number
those
treated
in
public
institutions
an
aggregate
is
obtained
of
more
than
cases
every
year
if
the
former
are
double
the
number
of
the
latter
the
sum
will
be
over
cases
per
annum
either
of
these
conjectures
is
below
the
truth
and
we
are
satisfied
from
professional
experience
and
inquiry
that
there
is
no
exaggeration
in
estimating
the
number
of
patients
treated
privately
every
year
for
as
at
least
quadruple
the
cases
receiving
assistance
in
hospitals
and
charitable
establishments
result
is
the
enormous
sum
of
thousand
cases
every
year
if
each
person
suffered
only
one
attack
each
year
this
would
represent
one
sixth
of
the
total
population
above
fifteen
years
of
age
but
many
persons
especially
among
abandoned
women
and
profligate
men
are
infected
several
times
in
the
course
of
twelve
months
and
any
attempt
to
say
what
proportion
of
individuals
are
represented
in
these
cases
would
be
mere
speculation
without
a
particle
of
conclusive
evidence
to
support
it
notwithstanding
the
magnitude
of
the
result
a
very
brief
consideration
will
show
that
it
is
not
extravagant
in
addition
to
the
arguments
already
advanced
in
this
chapter
the
reader
will
recollect
that
in
a
previous
section
it
has
been
shown
that
two
out
of
every
five
prostitutes
in
new
york
the
syphilitic
supposing
a
girl
relinquishes
her
calling
as
soon
as
she
becomes
aware
of
being
diseased
several
days
may
have
elapsed
before
she
discovered
her
condition
and
during
that
interval
she
must
have
infected
every
man
who
had
intercourse
with
her
to
take
the
most
liberal
view
it
may
be
conceded
that
the
portion
who
acknowledged
infection
were
not
all
suffering
from
the
primary
or
communicable
form
many
of
them
had
doubtless
recovered
from
that
but
if
only
one
half
were
so
suffering
and
each
of
these
infected
only
one
man
the
result
would
be
men
diseased
every
year
this
is
not
an
exaggerated
estimate
as
was
said
when
alluding
to
the
prostitutes
who
admitted
their
contamination
there
can
be
no
possible
suspicion
that
they
would
acknowledge
sickness
if
they
could
avoid
doing
so
and
consequently
the
sick
are
certainly
not
overrated
it
may
be
objected
that
the
numbers
who
owned
disease
were
spread
over
a
considerable
space
of
time
but
this
can
be
met
with
the
fact
that
the
inquiry
which
produced
this
result
was
in
progress
simultaneously
in
all
parts
of
the
city
at
the
farthest
it
did
not
extend
three
months
from
the
time
of
commencement
to
completion
and
the
natural
presumption
would
be
that
as
during
that
time
the
health
of
the
women
was
neither
better
nor
worse
than
in
any
other
three
months
of
any
year
the
same
proportion
of
diseased
women
could
be
found
whenever
an
investigation
was
made
in
other
words
that
two
out
of
five
prostitutes
in
new
york
are
diseased
the
calculation
that
of
these
diseased
women
one
half
only
are
affected
in
a
manner
which
renders
them
liable
to
infect
their
paramours
is
also
a
liberal
one
syphilis
when
manifested
in
its
secondary
stage
in
the
shape
of
sores
eruptions
and
blotches
upon
the
face
or
person
is
so
disgusting
that
no
prostitute
thus
disfigured
could
retain
her
place
in
any
brothel
unless
it
was
one
of
the
very
lowest
grade
because
her
appearance
would
immediately
repel
all
visitors
in
its
primary
or
local
form
it
is
of
course
concealed
from
her
customers
and
may
be
so
concealed
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
these
facts
borne
in
mind
is
it
not
almost
too
liberal
an
estimate
to
assume
that
one
half
who
admit
syphilis
are
suffering
in
the
secondary
or
palpable
form
this
line
of
argument
supported
by
the
facts
given
is
perfectly
justifiable
view
it
in
what
light
you
may
and
proves
that
the
estimate
of
cases
of
venereal
disease
annually
is
much
too
small
another
course
of
reasoning
may
be
adopted
the
time
occupied
in
taking
the
census
is
stated
at
three
months
this
included
all
the
needful
preliminary
measures
the
instructions
to
examiners
the
conferences
with
police
captains
etc
and
the
final
proceedings
such
as
arranging
and
writing
out
reports
allow
one
third
of
the
time
for
these
introductory
and
concluding
adjuncts
and
it
will
leave
about
sixty
days
including
sundays
or
working
days
devoted
to
the
actual
inquiry
the
inquiry
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
syphilis
in
such
a
proportion
of
women
as
would
amount
to
an
aggregate
of
two
thousand
on
the
total
number
of
public
prostitutes
suppose
the
disease
of
two
thousand
women
equally
distributed
over
the
days
or
in
other
words
that
an
average
number
were
infected
and
confessed
it
every
day
and
the
result
is
women
diseased
every
hours
we
wish
to
make
this
argument
as
plain
as
possible
and
the
reader
will
pardon
what
may
appear
needless
repetition
if
this
disease
existed
in
each
woman
for
four
days
before
she
was
conscious
of
it
or
it
became
so
troublesome
as
to
force
her
from
her
calling
and
during
this
interval
of
four
days
each
woman
had
intercourse
with
only
one
man
per
day
over
fifty
thousand
men
would
be
exposed
to
the
risk
almost
the
certainty
of
contracting
infection
in
the
course
of
the
year
as
the
said
in
the
course
of
a
similar
argument
upon
syphilis
in
london
this
estimate
is
ridiculously
small
in
the
first
place
a
majority
of
the
women
would
not
abandon
their
calling
in
four
days
after
infection
but
would
continue
it
as
long
as
they
could
possibly
submit
to
the
suffering
involved
every
resident
of
new
york
will
remember
the
excitement
caused
in
the
spring
of
the
year
by
the
arrest
of
a
large
number
of
prostitutes
in
the
public
streets
their
committal
to
blackwell
island
and
their
subsequent
discharge
on
writs
of
on
account
of
informality
in
the
proceedings
but
it
is
not
generally
known
that
of
those
arrested
at
that
time
a
very
large
proportion
certainly
more
than
one
half
were
suffering
from
syphilis
in
its
primary
form
and
many
of
them
in
its
most
inveterate
stage
we
make
this
assertion
from
our
own
knowledge
the
result
of
a
professional
examination
and
mention
the
circumstance
now
to
prove
that
women
will
not
abandon
their
calling
when
they
know
themselves
diseased
so
long
as
they
can
possibly
continue
it
if
the
estimate
had
been
made
that
each
woman
continued
prostitution
for
eight
days
instead
of
four
days
after
she
was
infected
it
would
have
been
a
closer
approximation
to
the
truth
and
it
would
have
shown
over
hundred
men
exposed
to
infection
every
year
again
the
supposition
that
a
prostitute
submits
to
but
one
act
of
prostitution
every
day
is
ridiculously
small
no
woman
could
pay
her
board
dress
and
live
in
the
expensive
manner
common
among
the
class
upon
the
money
she
would
receive
from
one
visitor
daily
even
two
visitors
is
a
very
low
estimate
and
four
is
very
far
from
an
unreasonably
large
one
but
suppositions
might
be
multiplied
and
the
argument
extended
almost
one
more
calculation
shall
be
submitted
and
then
the
reader
can
form
his
own
conclusion
upon
the
question
whether
the
theory
of
thousand
cases
of
venereal
disease
in
new
york
every
year
has
not
been
supported
by
a
mass
of
evidence
far
more
weighty
than
can
ordinarily
be
adduced
to
establish
a
controverted
point
it
shall
be
assumed
that
the
women
infected
every
day
continue
their
calling
for
six
days
after
the
appearance
of
venereal
disease
and
during
such
six
days
one
half
of
them
shall
submit
to
one
and
the
other
half
to
two
sexual
acts
daily
then
in
the
course
of
a
year
one
hundred
and
thousand
men
would
be
exposed
to
contamination
to
this
add
the
number
of
women
infected
which
at
daily
would
amount
to
nearly
thirteen
thousand
in
the
year
and
a
total
of
one
hundred
and
thousand
will
be
presented
or
nearly
double
the
number
assumed
as
a
basis
for
remark
it
is
needless
to
advance
farther
reasons
in
support
of
the
soundness
of
that
opinion
next
in
order
will
be
the
consideration
of
the
amount
of
money
prostitution
costs
the
public
the
amount
of
capital
invested
in
houses
of
ill
fame
and
the
outlay
consequent
thereupon
presents
a
total
which
can
not
but
surprise
all
who
have
not
deeply
reflected
upon
the
ramifications
of
the
evil
the
police
investigation
of
may
quoted
a
few
pages
back
gives
the
total
number
of
houses
of
prostitution
as
and
the
worth
of
property
thus
employed
can
be
ascertained
with
a
tolerable
degree
of
accuracy
from
information
obtained
in
many
cases
by
actual
inquiry
the
value
of
real
estate
where
it
was
owned
by
the
keepers
of
these
houses
has
been
already
given
in
some
instances
and
in
others
the
rent
may
be
assumed
equivalent
to
ten
per
cent
per
annum
upon
the
cost
of
the
property
which
is
certainly
not
an
undue
valuation
dividing
the
total
number
of
houses
into
four
classes
the
estimate
stands
as
follows
houses
of
the
first
class
are
estimated
from
actual
inquiry
to
be
worth
including
real
estate
and
furniture
each
or
a
total
of
houses
of
the
second
class
are
estimated
at
per
cent
less
than
those
of
the
first
class
namely
for
each
or
a
total
of
houses
of
the
third
class
at
each
houses
of
the
fourth
class
at
each
houses
of
prostitution
are
estimated
worth
add
for
houses
of
assignation
houses
of
the
first
class
at
each
second
third
fourth
total
for
houses
of
prostitution
and
assignation
in
addition
to
this
are
liquor
and
stores
mainly
dependent
upon
the
custom
of
prostitutes
and
their
companions
any
place
in
which
it
is
possible
to
carry
on
either
of
these
businesses
must
be
worth
a
year
rent
which
would
give
a
value
of
each
or
a
total
of
the
necessary
stock
fixtures
and
implements
can
not
be
worth
less
on
an
average
than
in
each
place
this
gives
a
total
of
and
an
aggregate
capital
of
invested
in
the
business
of
prostitution
that
this
is
not
an
extravagant
estimate
will
be
admitted
by
any
real
estate
owner
or
person
acquainted
with
the
value
of
property
in
the
city
especially
if
he
takes
into
consideration
the
location
of
many
of
the
houses
and
calculates
how
much
more
the
adjacent
lands
and
buildings
would
be
worth
if
these
resorts
of
vice
and
infamy
were
removed
on
a
scale
correspondingly
large
is
the
amount
of
money
actually
spent
upon
prostitutes
the
weekly
income
of
each
woman
can
not
be
less
than
ten
dollars
many
pay
much
more
than
that
sum
for
their
board
alone
and
in
houses
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
prostitute
to
realize
as
much
as
thirty
or
fifty
dollars
or
upward
in
a
week
but
if
the
income
is
taken
at
the
lowest
point
the
aggregate
receipts
of
six
thousand
courtesans
amount
to
per
week
or
per
year
every
visitor
to
a
house
of
prostitution
expends
more
or
less
money
for
wines
and
liquors
therein
in
some
cases
this
outlay
will
be
larger
than
the
cash
remuneration
given
to
the
women
but
other
men
are
not
so
lavish
in
their
hospitality
and
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
such
expenditures
amount
to
two
thirds
of
the
previous
item
a
weekly
total
of
or
spent
for
intoxicating
drinks
in
houses
of
prostitution
every
year
in
describing
the
customers
of
houses
of
assignation
it
has
already
been
remarked
that
in
the
first
class
many
of
the
female
visitors
take
that
step
not
for
gain
but
impelled
by
affection
or
sexual
desire
they
would
spurn
the
idea
of
being
paid
for
their
company
but
the
houses
at
which
their
intrigues
are
consummated
being
luxuriously
furnished
and
conducted
by
women
of
known
discretion
and
secrecy
have
a
high
tariff
of
prices
as
one
of
their
features
visitors
must
pay
as
much
there
for
accommodation
as
the
rent
of
a
room
and
compensation
to
a
female
would
amount
to
in
places
of
less
pretension
it
is
assumed
that
visits
are
paid
to
houses
of
assignation
every
week
and
for
the
foregoing
reason
estimating
them
to
cost
the
men
the
same
in
every
instance
and
fixing
that
cost
at
three
dollars
for
each
visit
this
item
will
amount
to
per
week
or
per
year
the
consumption
of
wine
and
liquor
is
small
in
houses
of
assignation
as
compared
with
houses
of
prostitution
it
may
probably
amount
to
per
week
or
per
year
the
income
of
the
liquor
and
stores
frequented
and
mainly
supported
by
prostitutes
and
their
friends
can
not
be
less
than
per
week
for
each
house
and
as
there
are
establishments
of
that
description
the
aggregate
of
money
disbursed
in
them
will
be
per
week
or
per
year
these
sums
exhibit
the
outlay
for
the
pleasures

very

and
if

the

this
is

on

liberal
a

for
no
one
believes
that
an
individual
requiring
professional

can
obtain
it
so
economically
in

as
in

nor
would
even
the
fact
that
in

the

are

and
supplied
with
all
necessaries
more
than
counterbalance
the
sums
which
must
be
paid
for

the
desire
not
needlessly
to
exaggerate
facts
which
are
sufficiently
comprehensive
without
such
a
procedure
is
the
only
reason
that
induces
so
low
an
estimate
but
there
are
yet
other
items
of
expenditure
which
must
be
noticed
before
the
long
array
is
completed
foremost
of
these
is
the
cost
for
support
of
abandoned
women
in
the
and
penitentiary
on
blackwell
island
the
proportion
of
females
committed
to
the
during
was
three
fifths
of
the
total
commitments
it
is
not
asserted
that
all
these
were
prostitutes
but
it
is
certain
that
the
larger
part
were
unchaste
and
for
argument
sake
we
will
take
the
ratio
as
two
abandoned
to
one
virtuous
woman
the
latter
representing
the
class
whom
poverty
sickness
or
friendlessness
may
have
driven
to
accept
a
shelter
in
the
institution
the
expenses
of
the
for
the
year
amounted
to
and
the
share
of
cost
incurred
on
behalf
of
prostitutes
would
therefore
be
per
year
or
per
week
the
females
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
from
courts
of
criminal
jurisdiction
during
amount
to
per
cent
of
the
total
number
incarcerated
it
will
violate
no
probability
to
assume
that
all
these
women
were
prostitutes
there
may
be
exceptions
to
the
rule
but
so
rare
are
they
as
not
to
invalidate
the
principle
the
penitentiary
was
supported
during
at
an
outlay
to
the
of
nearly
and
the
proportion
chargeable
to
prostitutes
at
the
ratio
given
above
is
per
year
or
per
week
a
farther
portion
of
the
expenses
of
the
and
penitentiary
might
very
plausibly
be
included
in
the
list
namely
the
share
incurred
by
the
maintenance
of
those
men
who
owe
their
imprisonment
either
to
crimes
committed
at
the
instigation
of
common
women
or
for
the
sake
of
supporting
them
or
to
a
course
of
idleness
and
dissipation
resulting
from
the
companionship
of
prostitutes
to
pursue
this
subject
in
all
its
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
nearly
every
male
prisoner
owes
his
confinement
less
or
more
remotely
to
one
or
the
other
of
these
causes
and
hence
it
could
be
argued
that
all
the
expenses
of
male
imprisonment
should
be
taken
into
this
account
on
the
other
hand
such
a
course
could
be
opposed
with
the
plea
that
crimes
which
send
men
to
blackwell
island
are
only
indirect
results
of
the
system
under
discussion
and
to
recognize
them
would
force
the
recognition
of
many
other
indirect
consequences
daily
occurring
elsewhere
strictly
speaking
the
position
is
scarcely
demonstrable
enough
to
form
an
arithmetical
calculation
but
its
moral
certainty
is
so
far
acknowledged
as
to
make
it
a
serious
matter
of
reflection
in
connection
with
the
attendant
evils
of
prostitution
to
resume
about
per
cent
of
the
population
of
the
blackwell
island
are
females
some
of
these
are
old
decrepit
women
whom
it
would
be
impossible
to
consider
as
prostitutes
others
are
virtuous
women
whose
poverty
has
driven
them
there
but
many
are
broken
down
prostitutes
who
have
lost
whatever
of
attraction
they
once
possessed
and
with
ruined
health
and
debilitated
constitutions
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
exist
even
in
the
lowest
brothels
they
make
the
their
last
and
there
await
the
final
summons
which
shall
close
their
career
of
sin
and
misery
yet
another
class
in
this
institution
is
composed
of
women
with
young
children
some
claim
to
be
respectable
married
women
while
others
are
known
as
disreputable
characters
but
the
former
have
little
to
support
their
pretensions
except
their
own
assertion
and
collateral
testimony
sometimes
invalidates
that
it
is
not
an
uncharitable
conclusion
that
at
least
one
half
of
the
female
inmates
of
the
owe
their
dependence
upon
charity
to
their
own
prostitution
the
support
of
the
in
cost
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
proportion
resulting
from
prostitution
on
the
above
data
is
per
year
or
per
week
the
children
on
randall
island
may
be
classified
according
to
the
rule
already
adopted
in
reference
to
disease
in
the
nursery
hospital
there
namely
to
assume
that
one
half
owe
if
not
their
existence
certainly
their
support
from
public
funds
to
causes
that
originated
in
vice
the
nursery
exclusive
of
the
hospital
cost
during
last
year
one
half
of
which
must
in
accordance
with
the
previous
estimate
be
charged
to
prostitution
namely
per
year
or
per
week
the
final
charge
arises
from
the
police
and
judiciary
expenses
of
the
city
of
new
york
of
which
it
is
believed
that
ten
per
cent
is
caused
by
prostitution
and
its
concomitant
crimes
and
sufferings
the
aggregate
forms
a
large
amount
and
will
be
rather
a
surmise
than
an
assertion
the
maintenance
of
and
of
and
their
of
the
city
judge
and
recorder
with
their
respective
courts
of
the
city
and
district
prisons
and
numerous
contingent
expenses
can
not
be
less
than
two
million
dollars
a
year
the
percentage
chargeable
to
prostitution
will
therefore
be
per
year
or
per
week
thus
much
for
preliminary
explanations
it
will
now
be
possible
to
present
the
reader
with
a
tabular
statement
of
the
weekly
and
yearly
cost
of
the
system
of
prostitution
existing
in
the
metropolis
of
the
new
world
those
who
have
followed
us
through
this
argument
and
noted
the
facts
upon
which
every
calculation
is
based
will
bear
witness
that
nothing
has
been
exaggerated
that
no
dollar
is
debited
to
the
vice
without
strong
presumptive
evidence
to
support
such
charge
and
that
the
endeavor
has
been
throughout
rather
to
underestimate
than
exceed
the
bounds
of
strict
probability
upon
this
ground
the
attention
of
the
public
is
earnestly
requested
to
the
first
exposition

to

the
proposition
we
may

permitted
to
hope
that
financial
considerations
combined
with
the
claims

humanity
the
appeals
of
virtue

morality
the
demands
of
public
health

the
future

of

exercise
that
influence
on
the
public

to
the
accomplishment
of
any
valuable
practical
result
from
the
present
investigation
before
leaving
the
subject
of
the
extent
of
prostitution
it
may
be
appropriate
to
remark
that
it
was
considered
advisable
to

prevalence
of
the
vice
in
some

the
leading

i
can
not
make
any
excuse
for
not
answering
your
letter
of
inquiry
that
will
justify
me
yours
of
september
was
unfortunately
mislaid
our
population
in
was
by
census
we
have
no
houses
of
ill
fame
in
our
city
none
of
assignation
there
are
no
public
prostitutes
it
may
appear
strange
to
you
that
the
above
should
be
the
case
but
there
is
good
reason
for
it
from
the
best
information
that
i
can
get
there
are
perhaps
fifty
private
prostitutes
in
this
city
composed
of
girls
living
at
service
or
as
seamstresses
but
who
conduct
themselves
so
as
not
to
be
known
our
city
is
so
near
to
new
york
that
as
soon
as
a
girl
turns
out
she
makes
her
way
to
it
where
associations
and
congenial
amusements
make
it
more
agreeable
it
is
rather
singular
but
so
soon
as
it
becomes
known
that
a
girl
is
loose
she
is
marked
and
followed
in
the
streets
by
boys
hooting
at
and
really
forcing
her
to
leave
town
occasionally
it
is
made
known
to
the
police
that
a
couple
of
girls
staid
a
night
or
two
at
some
when
they
are
arrested
as
vagrants
or
warned
off
and
they
are
gone
new

being
so
much
greater
field
for
them

your

sir
i
have
had
the
communication
addressed
to
you
by
wm
sanger
resident
physician
blackwell
island
new
york
in
regard
to
prostitutes
and
prostitution
in
the
city
of
new
haven
under
consideration
and
beg
leave
to
report
that
the
answers
to
the
questions
propounded
are
given
in
a
general
manner
with
near
approximation
to
exactness
without
pretending
to
be
minutely
accurate
and
to
the
first
question
namely
many
houses
of
prostitution
are
there
in
the
city
i
answer
that
the
number
now
known
as
such
to
the
police
is
and
that
these
are
only
such
some
of
them
occasionally
and
that
none
of
them
would
be
so
called
in
new
york
being
inconsiderable
in
poor
houses
and
conducted
with
great
secrecy
and
are
constantly
liable
to
the
penalties
of
a
law
peculiar
to
connecticut
which
punishes
rendering
it
impossible
for
them
to
gain
strength
and
become
permanent
and
to
the
second
inquiry
many
houses
of
assignation
are
there
in
the
city
i
answer
there
are
known
to
be
and
others
suspected
but
these
all
are
not
such
proper
but
are
connected
with
some
business
as
hotels
etc
and
to
the
third
inquiry
many
public
prostitutes
are
there
in
the
city
there
are
known
by
name
all
well
known
and
to
the
fourth
inquiry
many
private
prostitutes
are
there
in
the
city
i
answer
that
there
are
thirty
with
many
married
women
and
indeed
this
class
is
mostly
composed
of
married
women
and
to
the
fifth
question
many
kept
mistresses
are
there
in
the
city
the
answer
is
that
the
number
is
not
known
but
is
small
and
no
one
instance
is
certainly
known
to
us
the
population
of
the
city
is
thousand
all
which

that

resident
this
information
was
received
from
a
gentleman
himself
an
inhabitant
of
newark
there
is
no
doubt
that
much
of
the
vice
of
newark
finds
a
home
in
new
york
as
the
mayor
says
but
it
is
equally
certain
that
it
is
not
all
expatriated
the
mayor
of
philadelphia
is
particularly
wide
of
the
mark
there
may
not
be
as
many
public
prostitutes
there
as
in
new
york
but
it
is
proverbial
and
is
as
widely
known
as
is
philadelphia
itself
that
its
streets
abound
in
houses
of
assignation
and
private
houses
of
prostitution
pittsburgh
is
situated
at
the
head
of
navigation
on
the
ohio
river
at
the
confluence
of
the
alleghany
and
monongahela
rivers
both
navigable
she
has
canals
and
large
manufactories
and
if
closely
examined
would
probably
show
a
larger
proportion
of
prostitutes
than
above
reported
norfolk
is
the
largest
naval
depôt
in
this
country
and
its
population
can
not
be
held
responsible
for
all
the
prostitution
within
its
limits
in
both
norfolk
and
savannah
we
presume
that
the
larger
portion
of
the
abandoned
women
at
the
time
the
census
was
taken
were
colored
people
whose
virtue
is
always
at
a
discount
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
and
to
which
a
seaport
is
always
fatal
but
another
calculation
may
be
made
upon
the
assumption
that
the
males
who
have
commerce
with
prostitutes
form
only
one
fourth
of
the
population
and
the
proportions
resulting
from
that
are
as
follows
new
york
on
the
resident
population
of
the
city
proper
has
prostitute
to
every
men
but
including
the
suburbs
buffalo
has
louisville
has
newark
has
new
haven
has
norfolk
has
philadelphia
has
pittsburgh
has
savannah
has
to
arrive
at
an
average
we
will
omit
the
calculation
of
the
proportion
of
prostitutes
to
the
population
of
new
york
city
proper
it
having
been
shown
already
that
the
responsibility
of
much
of
it
must
rest
upon
the
suburbs
and
upon
visitors
and
also
omit
newark
philadelphia
and
pittsburg
because
the
reports
from
those
cities
are
palpably
underrated
this
done
the
mean
of
the
two
estimates
stands
thus
new
york
prostitute
to
every
men
buffalo
louisville
new
haven
norfolk
savannah
and
the
mean
of
the
whole
is
this
mean
may
be
fairly
assumed
as
the
proportion
existing
in
all
the
large
cities
of
the
union
and
the
farther
assumption
that
the
men
who
visit
houses
of
prostitution
form
one
fourth
of
the
total
population
will
give
a
basis
upon
which
the
total
number
of
the
prostitutes
in
the
united
states
may
be
estimated
with
some
accuracy
the
calculation
can
not
of
course
be
claimed
as
absolutely
correct
as
that
would
be
an
impossibility
but
is
submitted
as
a
probability
on
which
the
reader
can
form
his
own
conclusion
the
population
of
the
united
states
in
was
estimated
by
professor
de
bow
when
preparing
the
compendium
of
the
census
of
and
his
calculation
at
that
time
was
that
by
the
present
year
it
would
amount
to
persons
which
may
be
taken
in
round
numbers
from
this
must
be
deducted
slaves
which
will
leave
the
free
inhabitants
and
the
proportion
of
adult
males
to
this
number
is
it
may
next
be
assumed
that
one
half
of
these
men
live
in
country
places
or
small
cities
where
prostitution
does
not
exist
the
other
moiety
being
inhabitants
of
cities
with
a
population
of
twenty
thousand
or
upward
and
upon
the
basis
already
proved
of
one
prostitute
to
every
men
the
result
would
be
a
total
of
prostitutes
the
whole
area
of
the
united
states
is
square
miles
and
if
all
the
prostitutes
therein
were
equally
divided
over
this
surface
there
would
be
one
for
every
square
miles
or
if
they
were
walking
in
continuous
line
inches
from
each
other
they
would
make
a
column
nearly
miles
long
if
the
inhabitants
of
large
cities
were
only
one
third
the
number
of
prostitutes
would
be
these
suggestions
are
of
course
mere
matters
for
consideration
and
are
not
given
as
definite
facts
allusions
have
already
been
made
to
many
exaggerated
opinions
as
to
the
extent
of
prostitution
in
new
york
city
and
it
may
be
well
to
notice
in
this
place
some
passages
in
a
work
entitled
an
inquiry
into
the
extent
causes
and
consequences
of
prostitution
in
edinburgh
by
william
tait
surgeon
edition
the
author
starts
with
the
impression
that
the
capital
of
scotland
is
the
most
moral
city
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
after
fixing
the
number
of
public
prostitutes
in
edinburgh
at
eight
hundred
or
one
to
every
eighty
of
the
adult
male
population
remarks
in
london
there
is
one
for
every
sixty
and
in
paris
one
for
every
fifteen
edinburgh
is
thus
about
per
cent
better
than
london
while
the
latter
is
about
seventy
per
cent
better
than
paris
happy
edinburgh
and
what
is
to
be
said
of
the
chief
city
of
the
united
states
of
america
of
the
independent
liberal
religious
and
enlightened
inhabitants
of
new
york
it
will
scarcely
be
credited
that
that
city
furnishes
a
prostitute
for
every
six
or
seven
of
its
adult
male
population
alas
for
the
religion
and
morality
of
the
country
that
affords
such
a
demonstration
of
its
depravity
it
was
not
surpassed
even
by
the
metropolis
of
france
during
the
heat
and
fervor
of
the
revolution
when
libertinism
reigned
triumphant
and
the
laws
of
god
and
man
were
alike
set
at
defiance
page
this
picture
is
any
thing
but
flattering
to
our
national
pride
but
it
loses
very
much
of
its
effect
because
it
is
contrary
to
the
truth
it
will
however
satisfy
our
readers
that
tait
was
misinformed
and
they
may
feel
a
slight
gratification
in
the
conclusion
that
his
pathetic
lament
for
the
religion
and
morality
of
their
country
was
unnecessary
on
page
of
the
same
work
we
find
after
stating
that
there
were
upward
of
ten
thousand
abandoned
women
in
the
city
of
new
york
the
rev
chaplain
to
the
new
york
magdalen
asylum
goes
on
to
say
these
we
have
the
clearest
evidence
that
there
are
hundreds
of
private
harlots
and
kept
mistresses
many
of
whom
keep
up
a
show
of
industry
as
domestics
seamstresses
nurses
in
the
most
respectable
families
and
throng
the
houses
of
assignation
every
night
although
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
the
number
of
these
yet
enough
has
been
learned
from
the
facts
already
developed
to
convince
us
that
the
aggregate
is
alarmingly
great
perhaps
little
behind
the
proportion
of
the
city
of
london
whose
police
report
asserts
on
the
authority
of
accurate
researches
that
the
number
of
private
prostitutes
in
that
city
is
fully
equal
to
the
number
of
public
harlots
in
this
passage
tait
shifts
the
responsibility
of
his
figures
to
the
shoulders
of
the
rev
who
is
represented
as
declaring
the
number
of
public
prostitutes
in
new
york
sixteen
years
ago
to
be
ten
thousand
and
assuming
the
private
prostitutes
to
amount
to
the
same
number
making
an
aggregate
nearly
three
times
as
large
as
an
actual
and
searching
inquiry
has
found
at
the
present
time
during
the
last
sixteen
years
vice
has
not
decreased
in
new
york
but
has
steadily
increased
and
yet
the
most
diligent
search
can
discover
in
only
public
and
private
prostitutes
instead
of
the
twenty
thousand
mentioned
in
the
publication
under
notice
we
imagine
it
to
be
an
imperative
duty
to
be
tolerably
well
acquainted
with
a
social
evil
before
attempting
to
write
upon
it
and
although
tait
book
can
not
by
any
possibility
injure
our
city
on
account
of
the
palpable
misrepresentations
it
contains
we
allude
to
it
to
show
the
opinion
entertained
of
new
york
and
its
vices
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
were
an
apology
necessary
for
the
preset
work
such
statements
as
these
would
be
amply
sufficient
tait
loses
no
opportunity
to
hurl
a
sly
dart
at
new
york
thus
on
page
after
quoting
the
words
of
the
rev
as
to
the
character
of
an
abandoned
woman
in
new
york
he
tait
continues
he
says
nothing
of
the
state
of
religious
feeling
among
the
prostitutes
there
and
if
we
are
to
regard
his
statement
of
the
number
of
prostitutes
as
strictly
correct
it
may
very
well
be
questioned
whether
any
considerable
number
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
city
are
under
the
influence
of
sincere
religious
feeling
some
of
our
new
york
city
readers
may
probably
recollect
that
the
publication
of
inquiry
produced
very
considerable
excitement
here
at
the
time
and
opinions
were
freely
expressed
that
he
was
either
very
ignorant
on
matters
of
that
nature
or
intentionally
colored
his
statements
and
was
in
either
case
entirely
unfitted
for
the
task
he
had
assumed
tait
assumes
the
population
of
edinburgh
at
about
two
hundred
thousand
the
number
of
public
prostitutes
at
eight
hundred
and
of
private
prostitutes
at
nearly
twelve
hundred
or
a
total
of
two
thousand
abandoned
women
this
gives
one
prostitute
to
every
adult
males
if
we
adopt
his
system
of
calculation
or
one
prostitute
to
every
adult
males
if
we
adopt
the
system
of
calculation
which
has
been
applied
to
the
united
states
in
the
present
work
from
his
own
figures
then
it
can
be
seen
that
although
new
york
city
is
so
awfully
irreligious
it
has
less
prostitution
than
pious
edinburgh
again
on
page
while
speaking
of
the
demoralizing
effects
of
theatrical
representations
tait
says
in
the
report
of
the
house
of
refuge
in
new
york
it
is
stated
that
one
hundred
and
fifty
boys
and
girls
out
of
six
hundred
and
ninety
are
guilty
of
theft
and
impurity
to
get
a
seat
in
the
theatre
he
does
not
mark
this
as
a
quotation
nor
does
he
state
the
report
from
which
it
was
extracted
as
he
has
printed
it
it
must
be
supposed
correct
although
we
must
confess
we
can
not
see
very
clearly
what
connection
exists
between
the
new
york
house
of
refuge
and
prostitution
considering
the
ages
of
children
generally
admitted
to
that
institution
and
while
we
have
very
little
doubt
that
many
of
the
inmates
thereof
have
committed
theft
for
the
reason
he
assigns
we
are
rather
dubious
as
to
the
acts
of
impurity
alluded
to
except
in
a
very
few
exceptional
cases
farther
on
page
tait
quotes
the
address
of
the
rev
on
prostitution
in
america
as
follows
at
the
very
hour
in
the
morning
afternoon
and
evening
of
every
day
when
the
people
of
god
assemble
for
religious
worship
then
in
a
special
manner
do
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
meet
in
troops
at
harlots
houses
on
the
sabbath
days
the
rooms
are
so
filled
with
visitors
that
there
is
no
place
for
them
to
sit
down
and
on
that
account
many
are
refused
admission
at
the
doors
these
palpable
exaggerations
require
no
contradiction
they
show
however
the
extremes
of
misrepresentation
to
which
an
enthusiastic
and
incompetent
writer
may
be
led
inclined
to
exaggeration
as
tait
has
been
proved
to
be
he
yet
protests
in
page
against
some
opinions
upon
infanticide
by
prostitutes
in
new
york
advanced
by
his
informant
the
rev
and
quotes
the
opinion
of
to
prove
that
mothers
are
generally
very
fond
of
their
children
this
fact
warrants
the
conclusion
that
his
other
opinions
upon
social
morals
in
new
york
are
entirely
derived
from
who
is
shown
to
be
any
thing
but
a
credible
witness
his
reliance
upon
such
a
source
is
much
to
be
regretted
as
materially
impairing
the
value
and
truthfulness
of
his
otherwise
interesting
and
useful
volume
the
following
extracts
from
the
compendium
of
the
seventh
census
of
the
united
states
will
be
interesting
from
their
relation
to
various
points
which
have
been
discussed
in
the
progress
of
this
work
they
have
all
a
more
or
less
direct
bearing
upon
the
subject
of
prostitution
and
the
condensation
of
them
here
will
give
readers
an
opportunity
of
verifying
many
of
the
previous
remarks
the
estimated
population
of
the
union
at
the
present
time
has
been
already
given
as
persons
including
slaves
the
proportion
of
females
to
males
at
each
census
from
to
is
stated
as
follows
this
relates
only
to
the
free
population
in
enumerating
slaves
no
distinction
of
sex
was
made
earlier
than
the
year
the
ratio
of
male
and
female
slaves
since
that
date
is
as
follows
from
these
tables
it
appears
that
the
males
in
the
free
population
and
the
females
in
the
slave
population
have
been
steadily
increasing
but
with
no
determined
ratio
of
progression
taking
the
total
of
free
and
slave
population
since
the
census
of
the
excess
of
males
is
stated
thus
of
it
will
be
seen
from
this
that
in
the
males
were
in
excess
at
the
rate
of
per
and
by
applying
the
same
rule
to
the
population
of

fair
estimate
of

be

the

that

it
to
be

it

of

as

exists
in

york
at
the
present

an
evident
duty
is
to
inquire
what
measures
can
be
devised
to
stay
the
march
of
this
desolating
plague
in
its
ravages
on
the
health
and
morals
of
the
public
this
is
a
problem
the
solution
of
which
has
for
centuries
interested
philanthropists
and
statesmen
in
different
countries
they
commenced
with
the
theory
that
vice
could
be
suppressed
by
statutory
enactments
and
the
process
was
vigorously
tried
under
various
auspices
until
experience
demonstrated
that
it
virtually
increased
and
aggravated
the
evil
it
was
intended
to
suppress
at
subsequent
periods
however
different
measures
have
been
adopted
with
different
results
it
will
be
necessary
in
the
first
place
to
consider
the
effect
of
stringent
prohibitory
measures
the
records
given
in
the
previous
chapters
of
this
work
show
what
these
have
attempted
and
they
also
show
at
the
same
time
the
uselessness
of
endeavoring
to
eradicate
prostitution
by
compulsory
legislation
the
lash
the
dungeon
the
rack
and
the
stake
have
each
been
tried
and
all
have
proved
equally
powerless
to
accomplish
the
object
admitting
that
in
religion
morals
or
politics
it
is
impossible
to
force
concurrence
in
any
particular
sentiment
while
a
kindly
persuasive
plan
may
lead
to
its
adoption
admitting
that
all
attempts
to
compel
prostitutes
to
be
virtuous
have
notoriously
failed
has
not
the
time
arrived
for
a
change
of
policy
if
in
direct
ratio
to
the
stringency
of
prohibitory
measures
the
vice
sought
to
be
exterminated
has
steadily
increased
does
not
reason
suggest
the
expediency
of
resorting
to
other
measures
for
its
suppression
it
has
been
said
that
history
is
philosophy
teaching
by
example
and
if
such
instruction
is
well
considered
none
can
fail
to
see
therein
an
unanswerable
argument
against
excessive
severity
in
this
matter
the
several
statutes
proscribing
prostitution
have
been
detailed
and
their
specific
results
given
as
gathered
from
the
experience
of
various
countries
at
the
time
these
laws
were
in
force
it
is
hardly
probable
that
their
authors
regarded
them
as
unsusceptible
of
improvement
and
the
question
now
arises
for
decision
in
this
age
of
general
progress
is
it
not
our
duty
to
try
the
effect
of
some
other
line
of
action
in
this
country
in
common
with
other
nations
we
have
passed
laws
intended
to
crush
out
prostitution
have
made
vigorous
protests
on
paper
against
its
existence
and
there
our
labors
have
ended
the
experience
acquired
in
this
course
of
legislation
only
demonstrates
that
such
laws
can
not
be
enforced
so
as
to
produce
the
desired
effect
but
why
are
they
still
retained
on
the
statute
books
is
it
not
an
opprobrium
upon
our
national
character
to
allow
them
to
exist
if
they
are
never
to
be
enforced
if
they
are
powerless
for
good
effective
only
to
increase
the
plague
they
were
designed
to
check
why
not
expunge
them
at
once
and
substitute
others
more
practicable
and
more
useful
in
their
stead
a
candid
acknowledgment
of
error
whether
by
an
individual
or
a
community
is
always
a
creditable
and
graceful
act
it
shows
that
experience
has
dictated
a
wiser
course
that
reflection
and
experiment
have
condemned
the
former
plan
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
system
of
laws
will
entirely
eradicate
prostitution
history
social
arrangements
and
physiology
alike
forbid
any
such
utopian
idea
but
will
not
a
more
enlightened
policy
do
much
toward
diminishing
it
many
of
the
present
generation
can
recollect
the
time
when
it
was
considered
right
and
proper
to
imprison
an
insolvent
debtor
but
this
idea
is
now
wisely
repudiated
by
society
and
no
one
will
assert
that
the
effect
of
the
change
has
been
to
place
any
additional
difficulties
in
the
way
of
collecting
legal
claims
capital
punishment
has
been
abolished
in
many
cases
and
yet
it
is
a
fact
that
crime
has
diminished
where
this
experiment
has
been
tried
this
is
more
particularly
the
case
in
england
where
forgery
which
was
punished
with
death
is
comparatively
rare
since
the
amelioration
of
the
law
a
general
conviction
is
becoming
prevalent
that
the
most
effectual
way
to
deal
with
criminals
is
to
attempt
to
raise
them
above
what
they
were
in
contradistinction
to
the
old
plan
of
sinking
them
lower
it
is
now
freely
acknowledged
that
the
elevating
instead
of
the
depressing
process
is
consonant
both
with
the
spirit
of
our
republican
institutions
and
with
humanizing
policy
even
if
american
society
is
not
yet
prepared
to
take
a
course
directly
the
reverse
of
its
present
prohibitory
practice
prudence
dictates
the
adoption
of
some
medium
rule
by
which
prostitution
can
be
kept
in
check
without
being
encouraged
or
allowed
as
in
the
prussian
laws
which
expressly
declare
that
the
vice
is
tolerated
but
not
permitted
government
should
be
patriarchal
in
its
character
and
exercise
an
effective
but
parental
supervision
over
all
its
subjects
this
is
the
living
principle
which
gives
vitality
and
strength
to
any
organization
and
no
satisfactory
government
can
exist
if
it
is
absent
now
in
regard
to
prostitutes
admitting
that
they
have
erred
still
the
people
who
constitute
the
government
in
this
country
are
concerned
in
the
matter
and
their
mutual
obligations
their
policy
and
their
pecuniary
interests
require
that
these
wandering
members
of
the
body
corporate
should
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
reformation
which
will
give
this
opportunity
most
effectually
to
crush
them
under
the
weight
of
their
own
misdeeds
or
to
adopt
a
liberal
course
likely
to
induce
them
to
abandon
their
depraved
habits
one
of
the
secrets
which
bound
the
soldiers
of
the
empire
to
the
standard
of
napoleon
through
all
his
battles
and
vicissitudes
was
the
knowledge
that
france
regarded
them
as
her
children
and
would
not
fail
to
protect
and
support
them
the
words
i
am
a
roman
citizen
derived
their
magic
power
from
the
fact
that
the
roman
empire
treated
all
her
citizens
as
sons
and
watched
over
their
interests
with
parental
care
the
recent
outburst
of
popular
enthusiasm
in
our
own
country
when
the
commander
of
an
american
national
vessel
rescued
a
citizen
from
threatened
outrage
in
a
foreign
land
was
an
emphatic
recognition
of
the
principle
can
we
now
consistently
refuse
to
apply
the
rule
to
all
who
need
our
kindly
care
it
may
be
considered
a
bold
assertion
that
our
present
mode
of
dealing
with
prostitution
is
calculated
to
widely
extend
its
prevalence
yet
the
historical
facts
already
given
are
sufficient
to
prove
its
truth
without
further
argument
the
existing
rule
of
treatment
instead
of
suppressing
the
vice
merely
drives
it
into
seclusion
a
result
far
different
from
the
design
and
infinitely
increasing
its
power
to
those
secret
haunts
of
prostitution
resort
the
lowest
and
most
depraved
of
the
male
sex
with
the
full
knowledge
that
a
fundamental
law
of
our
commonwealth
considers
every
house
a
castle
into
which
no
officer
can
enter
unless
armed
with
a
special
legal
authority
or
called
in
to
suppress
an
outrage
the
result
of
such
seclusion
is
to
confirm
the
vicious
habits
of
the
prostitutes
and
frequently
to
lead
them
to
the
commission
of
other
and
more
heinous
offenses
again
secrecy
further
augments
prostitution
by
preventing
the
approach
of
those
benevolent
individuals
who
would
feel
a
pleasure
in
advising
and
directing
the
daughters
of
misery
for
their
real
good
philanthropists
have
organized
prison
associations
and
magdalen
asylums
to
bear
upon
prostitution
but
they
can
only
reach
it
in
its
lowest
grades
when
the
females
become
inmates
of
public
institutions
from
destitution
and
disease
reformers
can
not
come
near
the
and
they
are
consequently
now
as
far
from
the
consummation
of
their
praiseworthy
intentions
as
when
they
commenced
their
labors
because
prohibitory
measures
force
prostitutes
to
take
shelter
in
seclusion
and
it
is
only
when
women
are
consigned
to
our
hospitals
and
penitentiaries
that
they
become
accessible
by
this
time
they
are
so
far
sunk
in
depravity
as
to
afford
very
slender
hope
of
reformation
this
is
more
especially
true
of
magdalen
asylums
there
is
indeed
a
field
white
unto
the
harvest
for
benevolent
exertions
in
the
most
secluded
haunts
of
prostitution
if
they
could
only
be
made
accessible
sympathy
is
worthily
bestowed
upon
the
sick
or
dying
women
transferred
from
public
institutions
to
charitable
organizations
to
alleviate
the
sorrows
of
their
final
sufferings
to
soothe
the
agony
of
the
hour
of
death
to
divest
of
its
terrors
the
passage
from
this
world
to
the
dread
future
is
a
work
in
which
the
heart
of
any
christian
must
rejoice
but
it
is
only
a
part
of
the
duties
contemplated
by
such
asylums
while
their
projectors
gladly
administer
the
consolations
of
our
holy
religion
to
an
expiring
magdalen
they
also
seek
an
opportunity
to
direct
erring
women
to
the
paths
of
virtue
during
the
life
that
still
remains
to
them
to
guide
them
to
a
path
in
which
they
can
retrace
the
false
steps
already
taken
and
become
useful
members
of
society
this
opportunity
for
exertion
is
denied
under
the
system
which
drives
vice
into
seclusion
turning
now
from
considering
the
operation
of
repressive
laws
we
notice
the
importance
of
sanitary
and
quarantine
regulations
one
of
the
first
cares
of
a
good
government
is
to
preserve
and
promote
the
public
health
an
illustration
of
this
position
occurred
in
the
summer
of
when
fears
were
entertained
that
the
city
would
be
visited
by
a
frightful
epidemic
fever
the
public
voice
declared
through
the
newspapers
that
the
most
rigorous
and
careful
sanitary
measures
were
needed
and
the
cleaning
of
streets
the
removal
of
nuisances
the
purification
of
and
many
other
measures
of
the
same
kind
were
loudly
called
for
and
adopted
as
far
as
possible
while
the
quarantine
regulations
of
the
harbor
were
strictly
enforced
in
view
of
this
danger
so
dreadful
and
apparently
so
imminent
the
united
voice
of
public
opinion
sanctioned
the
very
course
advocated
here
namely
the
adoption
of
remedial
or
more
properly
speaking
preventive
measures
venereal
poison
is
as
destructive
although
not
so
suddenly
fatal
as
yellow
fever
and
every
motive
of
philanthropy
and
economy
urges
the
necessity
of
effective
means
for
its
counteraction
since
remedial
or
preventive
measures
have
been
adopted
in
paris
the
number
of
cases
of
disease
and
the
virulence
of
its
form
have
materially
abated
this
fact
is
asserted
not
merely
on
our
own
personal
knowledge
but
also
from
the
corroborative
testimony
of
physicians
who
have
had
recent
opportunities
of
investigating
the
subject
in
that
capital
the
diminution
can
be
easily
explained
by
a
comparison
of
the
laws
and
regulations
applicable
to
prostitution
we
in
new
york
by
our
stringent
prohibition
drive
the
vice
into
seclusion
and
deprive
ourselves
of
the
means
of
watching
either
its
progress
or
results
while
our
french
contemporaries
insist
that
it
shall
be
at
all
times
open
to
the
of
properly
appointed
persons
the
extent
of
syphilitic
infection
in
new
york
has
been
portrayed
in
the
preceding
chapter
but
the
danger
of
contamination
must
not
be
viewed
as
a
merely
local
question
from
its
commercial
importance
its
mercantile
marine
its
centralization
of
and
canals
and
its
facilities
for
river
navigation
this
city
is
now
the
great
point
of
arrival
and
departure
of
travelers
and
emigrants
from
and
to
all
parts
of
the
union
foreigners
reach
here
in
large
numbers
every
day
intending
to
travel
to
other
states
if
they
remain
in
the
city
a
few
days
only
they
are
exposed
to
its
temptations
and
may
contract
disease
which
by
their
agency
will
be
perpetuated
in
the
district
they
have
selected
as
their
future
home
returned
adventurers
from
the
pacific
shores
come
here
to
find
the
readiest
transit
to
their
several
destinations
they
are
exposed
to
the
same
temptations
with
a
probability
of
the
same
result
merchants
and
visit
this
commercial
emporium
to
obtain
supplies
of
goods
and
they
are
exposed
to
the
same
fascinations
and
the
same
contingencies
the
sailors
in
port
are
similarly
liable
in
short
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
imagine
the
extent
over
which
the
syphilitic
poison
originating
in
the
proud
and
wealthy
city
of
new
york
may
be
spread
nor
would
it
be
an
error
to
describe
the
empire
city
as
a
where
from
the
nature
of
its
laws
on
prostitution
syphilis
may
be
cultivated
and
disseminated
possessed
then
of
indubitable
proofs
of
the
existence
of
syphilis
and
the
knowledge
that
its
range
is
more
widely
extended
every
day
gathering
additional
malignity
in
its
progress
the
next
point
is
to
inquire
what
measures
have
been
adopted
to
check
its
ravages
these
have
hitherto
been
found
totally
inadequate
because
based
upon
an
erroneous
theory
namely
the
idea
of
suppression
the
principal
public
or
free
hospital
where
the
venereal
disease
is
treated
is
the
penitentiary
hospital
on
blackwell
island
now
known
as
the
island
hospital
to
obtain
the
benefit
of
medical
treatment
therein
it
is
necessary
that
the
patient
should
have
been
sentenced
from
the
court
of
sessions
to
the
penitentiary
for
the
commission
of
some
crime
or
committed
to
the
by
a
police
justice
for
vagrancy
drunkenness
or
disorderly
conduct
from
this
fact
it
will
be
seen
that
there
is
strictly
speaking
no
free
hospital
for
such
diseases
as
the
only
one
intended
for
their
treatment
will
or
can
receive
none
but
those
sentenced
for
an
infraction
of
the
laws
still
the
necessity
for
professional
assistance
compels
many
both
males
and
females
to
submit
to
the
degradation
of
a
police
commitment
unfortunate
women
or
laboring
men
find
that
they
are
suffering
from
infection
possibly
they
have
no
money
or
probably
they
have
exhausted
their
funds
in
payments
to
charlatans
and
so
resort
for
aid
and
advice
to
some
one
of
the
public
dispensaries
unless
the
case
is
a
slight
one
the
medical
officers
there
advise
them
to
resort
to
hospital
treatment
to
procure
which
the
poor
sufferers
are
furnished
with
a
certificate
of
their
state
and
directed
to
apply
to
a
police
justice
they
follow
this
advice
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
magistrate
only
remark
is
do
you
want
me
to
send
you
to
the
hospital
the
answer
of
course
is
in
the
affirmative
and
he
forthwith
signs
a
printed
commitment
to
the
penitentiary
or
for
a
time
named
therein
and
ranging
from
one
to
six
months
at
the
discretion
of
the
magistrate

of
one
of
these

you
the

to
convey
to
the

the
body
of
who
stands
charged
before
me
with
being
a

without
the

of

and

contracted
an
infectious
disease
in

the
venereal
disease
requiring
charitable
aid
to
restore
to
health
whereof
he
is
convicted
of

the
record
of
which
conviction
has
been
made
and
filed
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
sessions
of
the
city

aforesaid
and
it
appearing
to
me
that
the
said
is
an
improper
person
to
be
sent
to
the
you
the
said
warden
are
hereby
commanded
to
receive
into
your
custody
in
the
said

the
body
of
the
said
and
safely
keep
for
the
space
of
month
or
until
he
shall
be
thence
delivered
by
due
course
of
law
given
under
my
hand
and
seal
this
day
of
in
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
fifty
police
justice
this
is
technically
called
a
commitment
on
confession
and
its
effects
are
precisely
the
same
as
they
would
be
if
the
individual
had
been
convicted
of
any
tangible
act
of
vagrancy
he
is
in
law
and
in
fact
a
prisoner
for
the
space
of
time
named
in
the
commitment
he
must
wear
the
prison
garb
and
submit
to
the
prison
discipline
until
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
it
is
well
known
to
the
justices
that
a
penal
commitment
like
the
above
will
immediately
secure
the
sufferer
the
medical
attention
his
case
requires
but
they
have
no
power
to
send
any
one
direct
to
the
hospital
and
here
an
inquiry
will
naturally
suggest
itself
what
does
or
what
should
a
magistrate
know
about
committing
a
sick
person
and
how
can
he
decide
the
time
such
invalid
shall
remain
under
treatment
a
conclusion
will
be
that
the
whole
process
is
an
absurd
one
at
the
best
and
its
requirements
a
hardship
on
magistrates
already
overburdened
with
legitimate
duties
the
reader
attention
is
requested
to
the
pecuniary
effects
of
this
plan
to
illustrate
suppose
the
case
of
a
man
committed
for
six
months
he
is
suffering
from
some
form
of
venereal
disease
and
in
this
state
is
received
at
the
penitentiary
or
where
his
clothes
are
taken
from
him
the
institution
costume
supplied
and
the
particulars
of
his
name
age
nativity
occupation
are
registered
with
an
abstract
of
the
commitment
by
virtue
of
which
he
is
detained
he
is
then
subjected
to
medical
examination
and
transferred
to
the
hospital
in
this
institution
he
remains
until
cured
if
that
end
is
attained
before
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
and
is
then
to
the
penitentiary
or
the
average
time
required
for
the
successful
treatment
of
the
disease
named
in
the
blackwell
island
hospital
will
not
probably
exceed
months
and
often
a
much
shorter
period
is
sufficient
but
the
man
has
been
committed
for
months
and
for
the
unexpired
months
of
his
incarceration
he
has
to
be
fed
clothed
and
lodged
at
the
expense
of
the
department
the
labor
he
can
perform
will
never
amount
in
value
to
the
actual
cost
of
his
support
so
that
he
is
maintained
four
months
accordance
with
at
a
positive
cost
to
the
of
the
city
because
they
have
already
supported
him
for
two
months
in
the
hospital
in
the
aggregate
of
cases
during
a
year
these
costs
amount
to
a
very
large
sum
need
any
farther
argument
be
adduced
to
show
the
palpable
absurdity
of
the
system
a
few
words
upon
the
moral
effect
of
this
local
system
upon
prostitution
in
new
york
premising
that
being
a
prostitute
is
acknowledged
by
all
as
a
degradation
while
a
vagrancy
commitment
to
the
or
penitentiary
is
a
positive
disgrace
the
system
is
a
portion
of
the
plan
already
mentioned
and
it
says
in
effect
we
the
people
of
new
york
city
will
give
you
an
opportunity
to
be
cured
of
your
loathsome
and
destructive
malady
but
only
upon
the
condition
that
you
become
the
inmate
of
a
penal
institution
we
know
that
you
can
not
be
cured
unless
you
accept
our
terms
and
we
will
make
those
terms
as
hard
and
repulsive
to
human
nature
as
ingenuity
can
devise
it
has
been
a
medical
axiom
that
no
two
poisons
can
exist
in
the
system
at
one
and
the
same
time
but
the
citizens
of
new
york
have
been
experimenting
for
some
years
to
ascertain
whether
two
moral
poisons
can
not
be
coexistent
in
the
same
person
by
adding
farther
and
unnecessary
disgrace
to
the
vice
of
prostitution
thus
widening
the
gulf
between
the
sinner
and
her
possible
return
to
virtue
the
impolicy
of
making
syphilis
a
reason
for
imprisonment
except
so
far
as
curative
measures
actually
require
it
must
be
apparent
to
all
were
it
merely
from
the
fact
that
it
deters
many
who
are
suffering
from
embracing
the
opportunity
of
cure
until
they
are
absolutely
compelled
to
do
so
how
excessively
wrong
is
this
principle
in
a
hygienic
point
of
view
must
be
evident
a
directly
contrary
course
making
the
hospital
attractive
instead
of
repulsive
would
be
the
true
policy
and
would
be
the
most
economical
in
its
results
nor
is
it
justice
to
the
medical
departments
of
our
public
institutions
to
clog
their
labors
with
a
proviso
which
prevents
their
aid
being
sought
until
the
last
extremity
when
it
can
only
exert
a
palliative
and
not
a
curative
agency
if
syphilis
could
be
reached
in
its
primary
stages
their
task
would
be
much
less
difficult
and
their
services
much
more
effectual
whereas
little
or
nothing
can
be
accomplished
when
official
regulations
keep
away
the
patients
until
the
disease
becomes
constitutional
and
the
mischief
is
done
as
in
morals
so
is
it
in
medicine
any
evil
to
be
treated
with
success
must
be
encountered
in
its
first
stage
and
if
our
regulations
preclude
this
opportunity
but
slight
hopes
can
be
entertained
of
any
good
results
under
a
more
liberal
system
the
physician
and
the
philanthropist
could
combine
their
efforts
the
former
would
not
have
to
encounter
disease
inveterately
fixed
on
a
constitution
the
latter
would
not
find
his
benevolent
designs
frustrated
by
a
lengthened
career
of
depravity
now
become
habitual
the
effect
of
the
provision
which
offers
medical
aid
to
prisoners
only
is
that
every
woman
of
the
town
will
try
all
possible
means
to
dispense
with
the
treatment
it
is
only
when
she
has
actually
fallen
to
the
lowest
deep
of
her
class
when
one
step
more
will
plunge
her
into
a
bottomless
abyss
of
helpless
and
hopeless
woe
that
she
will
voluntarily
accept
the
proffered
aid
she
will
endure
torture
from
her
maladies
or
rely
upon
the
assistance
of
empirics
and
submit
to
all
their
extortions
rather
than
become
a
prisoner
but
when
every
resource
is
exhausted
and
her
physical
torments
plainly
tell
her
that
she
must
obtain
medical
relief
or
die
then
she
submits
once
in
the
hospital
she
is
relieved
after
a
period
of
protracted
sickness
and
leaves
it
to
return
to
her
old
haunts
because
she
can
go
nowhere
else
the
law
having
affixed
the
additional
disgrace
of
imprisonment
upon
her
former
bad
character
sociality
is
a
characteristic
of
human
nature
and
if
these
women
can
not
gain
admission
to
any
company
but
that
of
the
vicious
and
abandoned
they
prefer
that
to
solitude
returned
once
more
to
her
former
associates
the
time
soon
comes
when
farther
medical
assistance
is
needed
and
thus
she
alternates
for
a
few
months
or
years
between
prison
hospital
and
brothel
till
death
puts
an
end
to
her
sufferings
and
a
nameless
grave
in
potters
field
receives
the
remains
of
one
whom
charitable
measures
properly
applied
might
possibly
have
made
a
useful
member
of
society
the
sense
of
shame
which
follows
a
single
deviation
from
the
paths
of
virtue
drives
many
women
to
prostitution
why
add
to
the
existing
sense
of
shame
another
infamy
when
she
unfortunately
contracts
disease
can
we
consistently
blame
her
if
she
becomes
callous
when
every
legal
provision
directly
tends
to
indurate
her
sensibilities
the
misconduct
of
parents
toward
children
has
been
shown
as
one
of
the
causes
of
prostitution
the
father
or
mother
drives
from
the
paternal
roof
the
child
who
has
committed
but
a
single
error
then
under
the
pressure
of
hunger
she
inevitably
sins
more
deeply
becomes
diseased
applies
to
the
public
for
relief
and
is
sentenced
to
imprisonment
the
first
mistake
that
of
the
parents
makes
her
vicious
the
second
mistake
incarceration
confirms
her
in
vice
we
denounce
such
in
the
parents
while
practically
we
ourselves
as
the
natural
guardians
of
all
who
need
assistance
are
doing
precisely
the
same
thing
where
then
is
our
consistency
if
it
is
right
for
us
a
body
corporate
to
practice
such
cruel
oppression
is
it
not
equally
justifiable
for
each
member
of
the
body
to
act
in
the
same
manner
in
his
individual
capacity
of
course
what
is
right
for
the
multitude
must
be
right
for
the
individual
and
our
own
conduct
convicts
us
of
inconsistency
we
have
no
warrant
to
condemn
parents
for
single
acts
which
we
perform
collectively
or
if
we
are
right
in
censuring
them
we
are
wrong
in
performing
the
same
acts
ourselves
if
they
are
reprehensible
we
also
are
culpable
this
system
with
all
its
absurdity
its
prejudicial
effect
on
public
health
and
its
obvious
tendency
to
immorality
is
not
adequate
to
stay
the
destroying
scourge
on
the
contrary
it
is
likely
to
extend
its
ravages
if
a
prostitute
arrested
and
committed
to
blackwell
island
for
drunkenness
or
any
disorderly
conduct
is
found
to
be
diseased
or
if
she
commits
herself
knowing
that
she
is
infected
she
is
immediately
placed
under
medical
charge
she
will
probably
remain
contentedly
in
the
hospital
until
the
worst
symptoms
of
the
disease
are
subdued
by
this
time
the
discipline
of
the
institution
has
become
irksome
to
her
she
communicates
with
the
with
whom
she
formerly
boarded
or
with
some
lover
or
acquaintance
who
sues
out
a
writ
of
or
which
instantly
effects
her
discharge
she
now
returns
to
her
former
haunts
again
to
aid
in
disseminating
disease
farther
to
undermine
her
own
constitution
and
to
infect
men
who
will
in
turn
become
a
charge
upon
the
or
by
their
agency
cause
others
to
become
thus
liable
the
instance
of
wholesale
release
mentioned
in
the
previous
chapter
will
recur
to
the
mind
of
the
reader
the
experience
of
almost
every
day
confirms
these
statements
it
is
well
known
that
there
are
those
who
hang
around
the
various
police
courts
expressly
to
attend
to
such
business
and
who
make
a
large
income
from
this
source
exclusive
of
other
matters
pertaining
to
prostitution
in
which
they
occasionally
exert
their
abilities
the
vagrancy
commitments
by
which
women
are
sent
up
are
generally
insufficient
and
there
is
no
legal
power
to
detain
them
and
force
them
to
submit
to
the
treatment
they
so
much
require
it
has
been
asserted
by
legal
men
of
high
standing
that
nearly
the
whole
of
the
commitments
issued
by
police
justices
are
defective
and
that
there
exists
in
law
no
impediment
to
the
immediate
discharge
of
every
prostitute
now
on
blackwell
island
the
public
can
readily
perceive
the
necessary
inefficiency
of
these
institutions
so
far
as
the
prevention
of
venereal
disease
is
concerned
the
facility
with
which
prostitutes
committed
to
blackwell
island
can
obtain
their
discharge
may
be
attributed
to
want
of
care
in
making
out
the
commitments
a
recent
statute
prescribes
the
form
in
which
these
should
be
made
requiring
the
recital
of
admitted
or
substantiated
facts
and
the
filing
of
a
copy
of
the
original
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
sessions
these
requirements
are
not
observed
and
the
reason
assigned
by
magistrates
is
that
their
own
time
and
the
time
of
their
clerks
is
so
fully
occupied
by
the
press
of
business
before
them
that
they
can
not
proceed
as
minutely
as
the
act
directs
this
confirms
the
view
already
expressed
of
the
impolicy
and
impropriety
of
placing
such
onerous
and
duties
upon
the
justices
but
as
they
would
be
liable
to
be
sued
for
false
imprisonment
if
they
committed
under
this
act
without
observing
all
its
requirements
they
issue
their
commitments
in
the
old
form
required
by
the
revised
statutes
and
are
sheltered
thereby
from
ulterior
consequences
these
commitments
direct
the
persons
to
be
confined
in
the
penitentiary
but
the
local
arrangements
of
island
require
them
to
be
sent
to
the
and
unless
this
transfer
is
actually
made
in
each
case
by
the
governors
of
the
for
they
can
not
deputize
their
power
it
is
a
of
the
right
of
custody
and
consequently
entitles
the
prisoner
so
transferred
to
a
discharge
it
has
been
claimed
that
the
is
a
part
of
the
penitentiary
but
this
point
has
been
overruled
because
the
statute
establishing
the
plainly
shows
a
contrary
intent
a
prisoner
is
entitled
to
a
discharge
on
another
ground
namely
because
the
commitment
has
not
been
filed
as
directed
or
on
another
ground
that
the
commitment
does
not
recite
the
evidence
by
which
the
fact
of
vagrancy
was
proved
a
final
ground
of
discharge
which
is
never
pressed
till
all
the
minor
technicalities
have
failed
is
that
the
whole
proceeding
is
illegal
because
the
statute
of
has
not
been
complied
with
on
these
grounds
a
writ
of
or
is
sued
out
the
preliminary
steps
being
a
petition
from
the
prisoner
or
his
friend
setting
forth
that
he
is
illegally
detained
an
affidavit
of
verification
and
a
certificate
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
sessions
that
the
commitment
has
not
been
filed
in
his
office
upon
the
presentation
of
these
documents
the
judge
to
whom
application
is
made
issues
the
required
writ
and
specifies
the
time
at
which
it
shall
be
returnable
the
action
of
the
two
writs
is
similar
excepting
that
a
writ
of
requires
the
production
of
the
prisoner
before
the
judge
in
addition
to
a
return
of
the
cause
of
detention
while
a
writ
of
only
requires
a
return
of
the
cause
of
detention
the
return
is
made
by
the
person
having
custody
of
the
prisoner
and
consists
of
a
copy
of
the
commitment
under
which
he
is
held
and
from
the
informality
of
these
documents
it
will
be
apparent
there
can
be
no
legal
ground
for
his
detention
the
judge
is
strictly
prohibited
from
entertaining
any
question
beyond
the
legality
of
the
papers
with
the
moral
aspect
of
the
question
he
can
not
interfere
and
as
the
commitments
are
generally
informal
he
has
no
alternative
but
to
discharge
the
prisoner
application
for
these
writs
must
be
made
in
the
name
of
an
attorney
but
such
name
is
often
used
by
an
agent
who
transacts
the
business
and
divides
the
fee
with
his
principal
from
this
sketch
it
will
be
evident
that
if
the
prescribed
form
were
observed
in
these
commitments
frequent
discharges
would
be
avoided
or
there
would
be
so
many
difficulties
to
surmount
that
they
would
be
very
rarely
attempted
does
no
responsibility
rest
upon
the
public
and
on
our
for
negligence
in
this
matter
without
conceding
that
a
vagrancy
commitment
is
likely
to
reform
a
prostitute
in
fact
the
weight
of
evidence
is
against
the
possibility
of
its
doing
so
the
case
stands
thus
the
legislature
has
provided
a
mode
of
relief
which
was
deemed
effectual
at
the
time
but
this
mode
is
evaded
or
can
not
be
observed
by
those
upon
whom
its
administration
devolves
the
public
have
long
known
the
existence
of
these
difficulties
but
have
never
interfered
to
give
us
a
better
act
by
their
refusal
to
interfere
they
stand
in
the
position
of
aiders
and
abettors
in
this
neglect
or
worse
than
neglect
the
actual
propagation
of
a
dreadful
disease
had
public
opinion
been
concentrated
upon
this
matter
an
inquiry
would
long
ago
have
shown
the
fallacy
of
our
present
system
and
suggested
the
required
amendments
this
has
not
been
done
but
public
remissness
in
no
way
diminishes
public
responsibility
this
doctrine
of
public
accountability
may
be
profitably
examined
for
a
few
moments
in
connection
with
the
general
aspect
of
prostitution
few
will
deny
that
the
mass
of
the
people
are
answerable
for
many
of
its
evils
they
are
cognizant
of
the
existence
of
vice
in
the
aggregate
if
not
in
detail
they
can
understand
its
effects
and
are
not
ignorant
of
the
principal
causes
which
lead
to
it
yet
they
make
no
effort
to
remove
existing
causes
or
to
prevent
future
evils
they
practically
treat
women
as
an
inferior
race
of
beings
and
can
not
even
give
a
poor
seamstress
employment
without
saying
in
fact
if
not
in
words
you
can
not
be
trusted
to
make
this
unless
a
man
examines
every
button
hole
and
inspects
every
row
of
stitching
to
see
that
you
are
not
defrauding
us
the
only
way
to
secure
confidence
is
to
bestow
confidence
but
if
a
person
is
treated
in
a
manner
likely
to
destroy
the
inevitable
result
will
be
a
recklessness
as
to
his
or
her
own
character
despised
without
a
cause
treated
in
mere
business
matters
as
imbeciles
or
children
or
thieves
it
is
not
surprising
that
women
become
careless
as
to
their
future
life
and
smarting
under
the
injustice
of
their
position
too
frequently
degenerate
into
the
wretched
beings
who
infest
our
streets
and
pollute
the
atmosphere
with
their
deadly
infection
the
public
then
are
responsible
for
this
prostitution
because
they
have
never
bestowed
any
attention
upon
it
it
is
one
of
the
gravest
and
most
difficult
of
social
problems
involving
the
interests
of
every
man
in
the
community
and
yet
the
most
stupid
indifference
has
been
shown
respecting
it
the
subject
has
been
canvassed
by
medical
men
on
account
of
its
sad
effects
upon
the
physical
organization
its
extent
has
been
known
to
judicial
and
police
authorities
from
its
social
and
civil
results
but
the
great
body
of
the
public
have
hitherto
decided
that
they
know
nothing
and
want
to
know
nothing
about
it
they
admit
its
existence
being
too
evident
to
be
denied
but
so
far
they
have
taken
no
steps
to
ascertain
its
source
or
stay
its
progress
because
it
was
a
matter
with
which
they
were
afraid
to
interfere
and
now
the
deplorable
consequences
accruing
from
it
must
be
laid
to
their
charge
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
are
many
difficulties
attending
any
investigation
of
this
vice
that
many
but
timid
people
entertain
the
opinion
that
it
is
one
of
those
gangrenous
ulcers
upon
society
which
can
not
be
alluded
to
except
in
whispers
that
more
harm
would
result
from
instituting
inquiries
than
if
it
were
allowed
to
exist
and
fester
on
unnoticed
this
apathy
which
has
heretofore
been
the
policy
has
made
prostitution
the
monster
evil
which
it
now
is
and
upon
those
who
have
advocated
or
may
advocate
a
continuance
of
the
same
course
of
silence
and
inaction
the
sufferers
from
the
vice
may
justly
charge
their
destruction
the
masterly
inactivity
of
the
statesman
is
unquestionably
justifiable
in
any
case
where
passive
resistance
will
overcome
an
evil
but
in
dealing
with
prostitution
a
diametrically
opposite
method
must
be
pursued
it
requires
an
active
aggression
upon
all
old
prejudices
an
explosion
of
still
older
theories
a
vigorous
commencement
of
a
new
course
it
has
been
shown
elsewhere
that
the
public
are
responsible
for
prostitution
because
they
persist
in
excluding
women
from
many
kinds
of
employment
for
which
they
are
fitted
while
for
work
in
those
occupations
which
are
open
to
them
they
receive
an
entirely
inadequate
remuneration
it
has
also
been
shown
that
the
community
are
equally
responsible
on
account
of
their
with
known
and
acknowledged
evils
another
reason
why
accountability
can
not
be
evaded
may
be
designated
namely
the
carelessness
or
more
properly
heartlessness
with
which
the
character
of
woman
is
treated
let
there
be
but
a
breath
of
suspicion
against
her
fair
fame
no
matter
from
what
vile
source
it
may
emanate
and
the
energies
of
man
seem
directed
toward
her
destruction
she
is
down
keep
her
down
is
the
almost
universal
cry
and
this
malignant
process
is
continued
until
the
victim
is
positively
forced
into
a
life
of
undisguised
immorality
the
sacred
decision
let
him
that
is
without
sin
among
you
cast
the
first
stone
is
entirely
forgotten
and
the
most
violent
in
their
denunciations
are
frequently
those
who
are
the
most
blameworthy
themselves
the
whole
force
of
the
world
opinion
has
been
directed
not
to
the
censure
of
actually
guilty
parties
who
induced
the
crime
but
to
the
poor
wronged
sufferer
she
who
is
too
frequently
the
victim
of
falsehood
and
deceit
or
the
slave
of
an
absolute
necessity
must
expiate
her
fault
by
submitting
to
a
constant
succession
of
indignities
and
annoyances
he
whose
conduct
has
made
her
what
she
is
escapes
all
censure
but
some
moralist
will
ask
how
would
you
have
us
treat
such
women
treat
them
sir
as
human
beings
actuated
by
the
same
passions
as
yourself
as
susceptible
beings
keenly
sensitive
of
reproach
as
injured
beings
who
have
a
claim
upon
your
kindness
as
outraged
beings
who
have
a
demand
upon
your
justice
lead
them
into
a
path
by
which
they
can
escape
from
danger
protect
the
innocent
from
the
snares
which
environ
them
on
every
side
and
when
this
is
done
pour
the
vials
of
your
hottest
wrath
on
those
of
your
own
sex
whose
machinations
have
blighted
some
of
god
fairest
created
beings
public
responsibility
must
be
understood
in
its
broadest
and
most
literal
sense
as
meaning
the
individual
accountability
of
every
member
of
the
community
the
time
has
not
yet
arrived
unfortunately
when
this
matter
can
be
left
in
the
hands
of
corporations
or
legislatures
their
constituents
must
be
aroused
to
consideration
of
its
importance
before
any
satisfactory
action
can
or
will
be
taken
by
them
and
it
is
to
the
thinking
men
of
the
age
that
these
pages
are
addressed
in
the
full
confidence
that
so
soon
as
their
sympathies
are
enlisted
public
action
will
follow
to
this
end
an
endeavor
has
been
made
to
show
the
injurious
effects
of
prohibition
disappointing
expectation
as
a
means
of
decreasing
syphilis
or
of
curtailing
the
limits
of
prostitution
the
necessity
which
exists
for
effectual
preventive
measures
and
the
inefficient
or
worse
than
inefficient
nature
of
the
local
arrangements
of
new
york
to
accomplish
this
desideratum
thus
the
way
for
a
consideration
of
the
remedial
process
has
been
opened
and
now
with
such
evidence
as
he
has
before
him
the
reader
may
be
asked
in
all
sincerity
if
he
does
not
seriously
believe
that
would
be
a
prudent
step
instead
of
trying
to
extirpate
the
evil
to
place
prostitutes
and
prostitution
under
the
surveillance
of
a
medical
bureau
in
the
police
extirpation
never
has
been
never
can
be
accomplished
in
any
community
repression
and
restriction
as
proposed
have
been
tried
and
have
proved
successful
assuming
an
affirmative
answer
to
this
question
and
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
it
otherwise
if
the
facts
are
dispassionately
considered
attention
is
respectfully
requested
to
the
manner
in
which
the
change
could
be
effected
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
the
case
there
are
required
a
suitable
hospital
for
the
treatment
of
venereal
disease
a
legally
authorized
medical
visitation
of
all
known
houses
of
prostitution
with
full
power
to
order
the
immediate
removal
of
any
woman
found
to
be
infected
to
the
designated
hospital
the
power
to
detain
infected
persons
under
treatment
until
they
are
cured
a
term
of
time
which
none
but
medical
men
can
decide
by
a
suitable
hospital
is
meant
an
institution
devoted
to
the
treatment
of
such
diseases
like
the
special
hospitals
of
paris
and
other
continental
cities
and
entirely
removed
from
all
connection
with
any
punitive
establishment
the
rules
proposed
for
the
government
of
the
island
hospital
when
its
name
was
changed
from
penitentiary
hospital
do
not
by
any
means
meet
the
urgent
requirements
of
the
case
the
penitentiary
its
officers
and
inmates
must
be
entirely
shut
out
from
the
desired
hospital
and
no
or
keeper
of
criminals
must
have
any
jurisdiction
within
its
walls
or
over
its
grounds
inmates
of
hospitals
have
too
long
endured
the
stupid
interference
of
men
and
it
is
time
that
medical
law
exclusively
was
considered
in
the
direction
and
management
of
buildings
devoted
to
medical
purposes
this
is
especially
necessary
in
a
syphilitic
hospital
on
account
of
the
character
of
its
patients
amount
of
imprisonment
as
a
punishment
ever
yet
reformed
a
prostitute
and
it
never
will
all
intercourse
with
prisoners
be
it
ever
so
transient
has
but
confirmed
women
in
the
tendency
of
imprisonment
is
directly
contrary
to
any
reformation
confirming
previous
habits
instead
of
rooting
them
out
the
instinctive
dread
of
incarceration
has
prevented
many
from
availing
themselves
of
the
medical
advantages
offered
them
particularly
among
the
better
and
higher
grades
of
frail
women
we
want
a
hospital
exclusively
for
the
treatment
of
syphilis
with
the
power
to
place
and
keep
there
all
women
so
diseased
until
cured
matters
of
detail
can
be
arranged
in
such
a
manner
as
to
admit
of
a
proper
classification
based
upon
the
degree
of
moral
turpitude
belonging
to
each
payment
could
and
should
be
required
from
all
who
possess
the
means
for
expenses
actually
incurred
and
this
would
contribute
a
considerable
sum
to
meet
the
expenditures
of
the
institution
among
these
women
as
a
body
there
exists
an
excessive
amount
of
pride
those
of
the
upper
class
will
not
associate
with
any
of
a
lower
rank
and
in
fact
look
upon
them
in
very
much
the
same
manner
that
moralists
regard
the
whole
body
to
be
enabled
to
reach
them
at
all
a
liberal
management
must
be
adopted
but
will
not
this
be
deferring
to
vice
because
it
is
dressed
in
silks
or
satins
asks
some
one
most
decidedly
not
let
the
arrangements
be
what
they
might
such
a
hospital
as
described
would
afford
no
encouragement
to
vice
for
in
it
all
must
submit
to
the
same
course
of
treatment
varied
only
in
the
minor
accessories
which
surround
it
even
if
the
arrangements
were
exposed
to
an
objection
like
the
above
the
end
would
justify
the
means
the
city
of
new
york
contains
at
this
day
venereal
infection
sufficient
to
contaminate
all
the
male
population
of
the
united
states
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
it
has
been
proved
from
official
and
medical
statistics
that
this
malady
is
rapidly
on
the
increase
and
a
paramount
question
is
how
to
be
relieved
of
the
incubus
rigorous
prohibitory
measures
will
not
effect
this
they
only
make
the
matter
worse
punitive
hospitals
will
not
effect
this
they
have
been
tried
and
found
wanting
free
institutions
would
in
all
probability
succeed
in
accomplishing
far
more
than
any
other
measure
our
citizens
have
ever
tried
the
question
is
one
if
not
absolutely
of
life
certainly
of
healthy
existence
and
its
inestimable
importance
must
all
doubts
and
difficulties
in
view
of
the
dangers
surrounding
our
rising
generation
even
supposing
the
men
and
women
of
the
present
day
exempt
from
them
it
would
be
perfectly
inexcusable
to
refuse
any
available
plan
because
some
one
of
its
features
might
not
please
all
tastes
adopt
an
arrangement
similar
to
that
suggested
and
if
any
crudities
are
discovered
they
can
be
readily
cured
as
experience
points
them
out
the
plan
is
not
presented
as
a
perfect
one
but
merely
as
an
outline
sketch
of
what
is
necessary
a
regular
medical
visitation
of
all
prostitutes
is
an
essential
part
of
the
scheme
and
its
organization
should
be
a
matter
of
serious
consideration
the
parisian
plan
already
submitted
might
form
a
very
good
basis
and
an
arrangement
which
throws
the
whole
system
of
prostitution
open
to
an
effective
police
supervision
and
the
establishment
of
a
medical
bureau
in
connection
therewith
for
professional
purposes
is
suggested
as
most
desirable
this
medical
visitation
conducted
by
physicians
to
be
connected
with
the
police
department
and
sustained
by
the
power
of
that
body
should
be
confided
to
men
of
recognized
skill
and
known
integrity
to
insure
public
confidence
so
essentially
necessary
in
the
inception
of
any
social
innovation
it
would
be
necessary
that
the
agents
upon
whom
its
execution
devolved
should
be
men
of
tried
probity
and
acknowledged
reputation
both
professional
and
personal
the
slightest
symptom
of
disease
should
be
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
the
immediate
removal
of
any
woman
to
the
syphilitic
hospital
the
residence
of
any
woman
be
it
temporary
or
permanent
in
a
known
house
of
prostitution
must
subject
her
to
a
medical
examination
as
it
would
afford
a
very
strong
presumption
that
she
was
there
for
immoral
purposes
the
propriety
of
a
medical
examination
of
prostitutes
at
certain
intervals
can
not
be
doubted
and
in
fact
it
is
practically
admitted
at
the
present
time
by
some
few
of
the
in
the
city
these
pay
a
physician
a
liberal
salary
to
visit
their
boarders
every
few
days
for
the
express
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
plan
suggested
now
resorting
to
treatment
whenever
he
finds
it
necessary
some
of
the
most
aristocratic
houses
of
prostitution
are
thus
attended
but
the
system
is
in
use
more
especially
among
those
natives
of
continental
europe
who
are
now
keeping
houses
of
ill
fame
in
new
york
and
who
in
bringing
to
the
new
world
many
of
the
customs
of
the
old
have
thus
testified
to
the
benefit
of
the
regulations
enforced
there
but
although
such
visiting
physician
may
pronounce
a
girl
infected
the
world
has
no
security
that
she
will
not
continue
her
avocation
and
in
order
to
remove
all
doubt
upon
this
question
she
should
be
instantly
removed
to
an
institution
where
she
can
not
possibly
propagate
the
malady
this
must
be
done
under
conjoint
medical
and
police
authority
among
prostitutes
of
the
lower
grades
systematic
visitation
is
more
imperatively
necessary
they
will
not
place
themselves
under
medical
treatment
unless
they
are
compelled
but
until
their
disease
assumes
a
character
that
prevents
the
possibility
of
farther
concealment
from
their
visitors
they
continue
to
ply
their
loathsome
and
destructive
trade
the
summit
of
ambition
with
them
is
to
keep
their
liberty
so
long
as
they
can
earn
enough
to
provide
themselves
a
shelter
and
feed
their
ravenous
appetite
for
intoxicating
liquor
they
are
content
to
submit
to
the
pains
and
ravages
of
syphilis
alike
heedless
of
their
own
sufferings
and
the
injuries
they
inflict
on
others
we
have
had
cases
under
our
own
professional
treatment
where
women
have
actually
persevered
in
this
course
for
many
weeks
after
they
had
become
aware
they
were
diseased
solely
for
the
reasons
indicated
it
may
be
objected
that
such
a
plan
would
offer
a
premium
to
lewdness
by
circumscribing
the
dangers
of
infection
but
this
argument
can
have
little
weight
as
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
promiscuous
sexual
intercourse
can
be
carried
on
much
more
extensively
than
it
is
at
present
the
vice
seems
to
have
reached
its
culminating
point
experience
proves
that
in
all
ages
of
the
world
there
have
been
many
men
whose
passions
were
so
violent
and
so
ill
regulated
that
they
would
attain
their
gratification
at
any
risk
even
though
that
risk
included
the
probability
of
venereal
infection
as
in
games
of
hazard
every
player
hopes
to
be
a
winner
so
in
carnal
indulgences
every
man
flatters
himself
that
because
some
gratify
their
lusts
unscathed
for
a
long
series
of
years
so
may
he
that
as
hitherto
he
has
escaped
disease
in
his
unhallowed
amours
he
may
continue
equally
fortunate
to
the
end
of
his
career
this
is
confessedly
a
poor
dependence
but
it
is
the
reliance
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
the
followers
of
her
whose
house
is
the
way
to
hell
diseases
of
a
syphilitic
nature
are
viewed
by
some
persons
as
special
punishments
for
special
sins
and
hence
they
argue
that
it
would
be
an
interference
with
the
order
of
providence
to
attempt
to
eradicate
them
the
discussion
of
a
theological
question
would
be
altogether
out
of
place
in
these
pages
but
the
supposition
may
be
met
by
a
parallel
case
delirium
tremens
is
the
result
of
an
excessive
use
of
intoxicating
liquors
and
may
justly
be
considered
a
special
punishment
for
that
offense
but
did
any
body
ever
know
a
case
in
which
those
who
object
to
the
treatment
of
syphilis
extended
a
single
obstacle
to
the
case
of
a
drunkard
if
it
is
right
to
adopt
curative
measures
in
one
case
why
exclude
them
in
the
other
but
even
supposing
that
the
treatment
of
syphilis
is
open
to
this
objection
so
far
as
the
guilty
parties
are
concerned
shall
their
descendants
be
involved
in
suffering
because
the
parents
sinned
if
a
rigorous
medical
examination
offers
additional
inducements
to
prostitution
by
reducing
the
probabilities
of
disease
it
also
guarantees
that
helpless
wives
and
unborn
children
shall
not
be
included
in
its
list
of
victims
go
to
the
thousands
of
married
women
now
childless
or
suffering
from
abortion
ask
their
opinion
go
to
the
thousands
of
disappointed
husbands
whose
hopes
of
offspring
have
been
blighted
in
consequence
of
their
own
youthful
dissipation
ask
their
opinion
and
see
what
the
answers
would
be
go
and
ask
the
diseased
children
on
randall
island
and
in
their
emaciated
frames
read
their
testimony
the
evidence
thus
obtained
would
prove
unanswerable
arguments
in
favor
of
the
plan
proposed
it
can
not
be
imagined
that
forcing
diseased
women
to
submit
to
a
specific
routine
of
treatment
in
a
special
hospital
involves
any
undue
interference
with
their
personal
liberty
the
right
to
commit
a
wrong
be
it
social
moral
or
physical
never
can
exist
the
slightest
reflection
upon
such
a
proposition
will
at
once
prove
it
untenable
the
spread
of
venereal
disease
is
a
positive
wrong
and
therefore
a
woman
who
is
suffering
from
it
and
is
certain
or
likely
to
propagate
it
is
as
legitimate
an
object
for
compulsory
treatment
as
would
be
a
maniac
whom
we
should
find
roaming
through
the
streets
of
the
city
or
a
person
afflicted
with
yellow
fever
or
any
other
contagious
or
infectious
malady
if
either
of
these
cases
were
to
come
before
any
member
of
the
community
he
would
not
for
one
moment
regard
it
an
infringement
of
personal
liberty
to
place
the
subject
under
proper
care
and
restraint
on
the
contrary
he
would
think
of
the
danger
to
which
he
and
his
family
were
exposed
and
flinging
theory
to
the
winds
would
immediately
urge
prompt
and
practical
measures
this
is
all
that
is
asked
respecting
prostitution
let
the
public
be
once
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
extent
and
danger
of
syphilitic
infection
and
there
would
be
but
few
objectors
to
these
suggestions
among
that
few
the
principal
portion
doubtless
would
be
the
advertising
empirics
whose
disgusting
announcements
occupy
so
much
space
in
the
columns
of
our
daily
journals
that
they
derive
a
large
income
from
this
source
is
indisputable
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
if
the
recommendations
now
made
were
adopted
they
would
find
their
occupation
gone
speaking
in
all
candor
the
health
decency
and
good
morals
of
the
city
would
be
better
cared
for
in
their
absence
than
it
now
is
with
all
the
combinations
of
their
extraordinary
success
unequaled
experience
and
unparalleled
facilities
in
a
financial
view
the
money
they
extort
we
refrain
from
using
a
harsher
term
from
their
credulous
patients
could
be
far
better
applied
than
in
contributing
to
their
wealth
farther
such
an
institution
and
organization
as
has
been
described
would
be
useless
did
it
not
possess
the
absolute
power
to
retain
every
patient
under
treatment
until
cured
whatever
modification
of
principle
or
mode
of
action
may
be
ultimately
adopted
and
sooner
or
later
must
be
this
is
an
indispensable
requisite
one
half
the
danger
of
venereal
infection
arises
from
imperfectly
cured
cases
under
the
existing
system
as
already
explained
writs
can
be
issued
at
an
almost
nominal
cost
to
remove
any
or
all
of
the
prostitutes
now
under
medical
treatment
on
blackwell
island
and
such
an
abuse
of
a
valuable
privilege
on
account
of
mere
technical
errors
must
be
fatal
to
the
success
of
any
remedial
project
it
would
be
as
reasonable
for
a
lawyer
to
petition
the
courts
to
order
a
vessel
detained
in
quarantine
by
the
board
of
health
because
she
was
infected
with
yellow
fever
to
be
brought
to
her
wharf
in
this
city
and
there
to
have
permission
to
disseminate
the
disease
on
board
as
it
is
for
the
same
individual
to
apply
for
a
writ
of
the
effect
of
which
is
to
take
an
abandoned
woman
reeking
with
disease
from
an
institution
where
she
is
under
treatment
and
allow
her
to
extend
the
venereal
poison
to
every
one
who
may
have
intercourse
with
her
this
must
not
be
understood
as
indicating
a
wish
to
curtail
the
constitutional
privileges
attached
to
writs
of
or
but
merely
their
applicability
to
cases
like
the
supposed
one
how
can
the
evil
be
prevented
simply
by
making
any
legislative
enactment
on
the
subject
so
plain
that
it
can
not
be
misunderstood
or
evaded
no
lawyer
would
find
any
difficulty
in
drafting
a
short
act
giving
the
police
department
the
power
based
upon
an
affidavit
made
by
a
member
of
their
own
medical
bureau
to
remove
any
diseased
woman
to
a
proper
hospital
and
her
there
until
it
may
appear
to
a
casual
observer
that
this
detention
would
be
of
the
same
nature
as
the
imprisonment
required
by
the
existing
mode
but
a
little
thought
will
point
out
a
wide
difference
now
we
force
a
woman
to
become
an
inmate
of
a
penitentiary
and
add
disgrace
to
her
disease
by
assuming
her
to
have
been
guilty
of
crime
then
we
should
require
her
to
become
an
inmate
of
the
hospital
with
no
additional
disgrace
but
that
arising
from
the
fact
that
she
had
contracted
syphilis
by
vicious
habits
in
the
one
case
we
make
her
the
companion
of
some
of
the
vilest
wretches
on
the
face
of
the
earth
in
the
other
she
would
have
no
associates
but
those
of
her
own
class
the
medical
bureau
to
whom
these
reforms
should
be
intrusted
although
connected
with
the
police
department
would
require
to
be
an
independent
body
so
far
as
professional
duties
are
concerned
its
connection
would
be
necessary
because
there
would
be
many
cases
requiring
the
intervention
of
the
civil
power
and
its
isolation
would
be
equally
important
because
much
would
depend
on
the
discretion
of
the
examiners
and
many
contingencies
might
arise
where
a
strict
line
of
routine
duty
would
defeat
the
object
in
view
they
would
be
literally
a
detective
corps
and
with
a
known
amount
of
duty
before
them
must
be
left
to
choose
their
own
method
of
performing
it
any
definite
arrangements
or
positive
orders
from
a
board
would
only
embarrass
their
action
for
medical
and
executives
always
clash
when
they
aim
at
one
common
object
of
course
a
leading
requirement
in
their
instructions
must
be
that
their
examinations
be
rigid
and
thorough
no
measures
in
this
respect
could
meet
the
absolute
demands
of
the
case
or
satisfy
the
expectations
of
the
community
it
must
be
plainly
understood
by
the
world
that
the
medical
bureau
was
required
to
perform
its
whole
duty
uncompromisingly
and
fearlessly
and
that
its
members
were
men
who
would
not
evade
the
responsibility
in
their
investigations
many
cases
would
occur
where
their
services
would
be
valuable
to
society
beyond
the
pale
of
professional
duty
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
they
would
become
evangelists
but
they
could
be
the
willing
and
efficient
coadjutors
of
those
who
delight
to
bear
the
gospel
to
these
poor
degraded
beings
and
even
while
listening
to
a
recital
of
bodily
sufferings
instances
would
arise
where
the
acts
of
the
good
samaritan
would
be
required
at
their
hands
they
would
be
the
depositaries
of
many
a
narrative
of
wrong
and
outrage
of
sorrow
and
suffering
and
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
believe
that
of
the
histories
poured
into
their
ears
some
would
indicate
a
channel
by
which
the
lost
one
might
be
restored
to
home
and
friends
and
virtue
or
point
to
some
chord
in
the
mind
which
would
give
a
responsive
sound
when
touched
by
the
hand
of
pity
the
adoption
of
these
suggestions
would
be
at
least
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
lay
the
foundation
of
a
system
which
can
be
gradually
enlarged
until
it
embraces
regulations
as
to
registry
management
of
houses
of
ill
fame
to
the
same
extent
as
is
now
done
in
europe
and
here
a
few
words
relative
to
the
licensing
system
may
not
be
inappropriate
the
propriety
of
granting
licenses
and
thus
making
vice
a
sort
of
revenue
is
open
to
grave
objections
but
on
the
other
hand
acknowledged
social
evils
have
ere
this
been
made
to
contribute
to
the
public
funds
witness
the
dealing
in
ardent
spirits
the
city
does
now
and
has
for
years
derived
a
considerable
income
from
licenses
to
sell
liquors
a
great
number
of
wise
and
good
men
contend
that
the
sale
or
use
of
intoxicating
beverages
is
not
only
an
unmitigated
evil
but
even
criminal
they
have
entertained
and
publicly
declared
these
sentiments
for
years
but
still
the
license
system
is
continued
it
may
be
a
question
for
decision
whether
prostitution
is
not
as
liable
for
taxation
as
drunkenness
and
if
both
were
equally
taxed
whether
as
a
body
we
should
be
more
responsible
for
the
results
of
one
or
the
other
it
may
be
noticed
that
an
annual
tax
of
one
per
cent
upon
the
property
engaged
in
the
business
of
prostitution
and
a
similar
assessment
upon
the
revenue
of
houses
of
ill
fame
would
amount
to
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
plan
here
shadowed
forth
would
not
be
likely
to
extend
prostitution
but
on
the
contrary
there
is
very
little
doubt
but
it
would
check
it
even
if
it
did
not
the
community
would
reap
an
advantage
in
the
sanitary
reform
it
would
enforce
in
low
neighborhoods
many
of
the
brothels
are
as
dangerous
to
public
health
on
account
of
their
crowded
and
excessively
filthy
state
as
are
the
syphilized
inmates
themselves
such
places
would
legitimately
come
within
the
province
of
the
medical
inspectors
and
their
reports
thereon
to
the
police
executive
would
insure
immediate
attention
public
morals
would
be
advanced
by
such
visitations
these
houses
or
a
great
number
of
them
are
the
resort
of
all
species
of
dishonest
characters
who
would
unquestionably
abandon
them
at
least
as
places
of
residence
if
they
knew
they
were
at
any
moment
liable
to
a
domiciliary
visit
again
almost
every
person
has
in
his
remembrance
some
female
who
left
home
and
could
not
be
found
because
securely
secreted
in
some
one
of
these
houses
of
prostitution
at
least
it
is
not
uncommon
to
read
of
such
cases
in
the
daily
papers
accompanied
with
an
account
of
the
unsuccessful
search
of
her
friends
and
the
police
occurrences
like
this
could
not
take
place
if
all
known
houses
of
bad
repute
were
under
the
of
the
medical
police
department
nor
is
it
unreasonable
to
hope
that
prostitution
would
be
diminished
it
has
flourished
of
late
years
in
seclusion
but
our
plan
would
render
privacy
impossible
seclusion
has
attracted
many
unfortunate
women
whom
shame
or
a
dread
of
exposure
would
have
deterred
had
they
known
that
houses
of
ill
fame
were
always
open
to
the
visits
of
the
police
or
that
every
few
days
a
physician
would
make
a
tour
of
inspection
and
a
personal
examination
to
which
they
must
submit
generally
speaking
these
women
have
a
dread
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
a
doctor
and
in
present
circumstances
they
know
that
a
medical
examination
is
optional
with
themselves
until
they
become
so
sick
as
to
render
it
unavoidable
but
if
their
miserable
life
were
burdened
with
the
additional
annoyance
of
a
compulsory
medical
treatment
it
is
probable
that
a
considerable
check
might
be
imposed
thereon
public
decency
would
be
advanced
by
such
visitations
to
effectually
perform
their
duties
the
medical
bureau
and
the
general
police
department
would
find
it
necessary
to
make
themselves
personally
acquainted
with
these
women
and
to
keep
a
register
of
all
houses
where
prostitution
was
carried
on
now
the
prohibition
which
has
driven
it
into
secrecy
has
also
rendered
it
difficult
to
determine
who
are
frail
prostitutes
are
found
in
hotels
fashionable
restaurants
excursions
and
suburban
retreats
they
visit
balls
and
other
public
entertainments
sometimes
by
sufferance
but
more
frequently
because
they
are
not
known
it
is
needless
to
say
how
virtuous
women
can
be
annoyed
and
insulted
by
such
companionship
or
to
what
extent
prostitutes
can
use
their
influence
in
miscellaneous
society
if
the
police
were
personally
acquainted
with
these
women
they
could
act
in
the
same
manner
as
on
the
continent
of
europe
namely
touch
them
upon
the
shoulder
and
quietly
give
them
a
hint
to
leave
or
another
reform
could
easily
be
introduced
the
confinement
of
all
prostitutes
to
particular
localities
in
the
city
so
as
to
limit
their
influence
this
would
be
tantamount
to
the
ancient
regulations
prescribing
their
dress
or
some
distinctive
mark
and
to
the
present
arrangements
in
europe
where
the
houses
are
distinguished
by
some
specified
peculiarity
it
would
also
prevent
the
depreciation
of
property
which
takes
place
in
any
neighborhood
where
a
brothel
is
established
public
decency
would
be
served
in
another
manner
it
is
a
most
humiliating
admission
that
new
york
is
fast
approaching
to
the
condition
of
certain
foreign
cities
where
unnatural
practices
first
led
to
the
contemplation
and
adoption
of
these
or
similar
remedial
measures
in
our
case
are
known
to
the
but
are
so
revolting
that
they
never
have
been
and
never
can
be
made
public
of
course
such
an
organization
would
take
special
cognizance
of
these
detestable
abominations
objections
to
the
expense
of
the
plan
may
be
raised
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
it
will
be
large
yet
it
will
be
a
matter
of
economy
to
incur
it
even
at
the
risk
of
increasing
taxation
which
will
not
recollect
that
every
year
as
the
virulence
of
syphilis
was
abated
the
cause
of
the
expense
would
diminish
and
that
in
a
direct
ratio
to
the
energy
displayed
in
the
examination
would
be
the
progressive
reduction
of
expenditure
it
has
already
been
indicated
how
some
of
the
inmates
of
a
syphilitic
hospital
from
whom
hitherto
nothing
has
been
received
could
be
made
to
contribute
their
quota
of
the
cost
now
the
public
bear
all
the
expenses
either
as
assessments
or
as
private
payments
in
individual
attacks
the
magnitude
of
the
latter
item
has
been
already
estimated
and
were
it
possible
to
calculate
in
addition
the
value
of
lost
time
the
injury
to
business
and
the
deterioration
of
the
constitution
the
total
in
one
year
would
be
far
more
than
sufficient
to
carry
out
the
whole
of
this
plan
for
double
the
time
it
would
also
be
economy
to
incur
the
outlay
on
account
of
the
benefits
to
succeeding
generations
syphilis
is
not
confined
in
its
effects
to
the
of
the
men
or
women
who
contract
it
but
is
entailed
on
their
descendants
these
provided
they
survive
its
baneful
effects
during
infancy
are
mentally
and
physically
unfitted
for
business
or
the
active
pursuits
of
life
and
consequently
are
frequently
indebted
for
the
means
of
sustenance
to
their
friends
or
to
public
institutions
if
the
liability
to
that
disease
among
parents
can
be
removed
no
fears
need
be
entertained
about
their
children
we
are
not
so
sanguine
as
to
imagine
that
all
the
good
effects
above
enumerated
could
be
accomplished
it
would
be
a
work
of
time
but
the
sooner
it
is
commenced
the
better
for
all
the
interests
involved
many
persons
will
say
oh
these
evils
do
not
concern
us
these
diseases
will
never
injure
us
or
ours
why
should
we
trouble
ourselves
and
give
our
money
time
and
attention
to
such
matters
stop
reader
human
passion
exists
and
while
the
means
of
gratifying
it
can
be
obtained
you
and
yours
can
and
will
nay
do
now
suffer
from
it
directly
or
the
first
question
for
any
citizen
to
ask
himself
is
can
prostitution
be
abolished
can
it
be
crushed
out
if
this
be
answered
in
the
negative
as
it
must
be
then
the
next
question
brings
him
to
the
point
sought
to
be
attained
in
these
pages
namely
the
means
that
shall
be
taken
to
circumscribe
and
diminish
its
consequent
diseases
and
evils
this
question
has
latterly
been
attracting
some
attention
in
england
and
plans
to
mitigate
the
evil
have
been
publicly
discussed
the
chief
grounds
of
complaint
or
at
least
those
brought
most
prominently
forward
were
the
assembling
of
prostitutes
in
the
streets
the
annoyance
they
caused
to
passengers
and
the
disorderly
character
of
this
term
is
applied
in
london
to
those
public
houses
wine
and
cigar
saloons
which
are
situated
near
the
theatres
and
places
of
public
entertainment
and
being
permitted
to
remain
open
all
night
become
resorts
for
prostitutes
a
public
meeting
for
consultation
upon
these
evils
was
held
in
london
in
january
last
and
the
remarks
made
by
some
of
the
speakers
are
so
much
in
accordance
with
the
general
tenor
of
this
work
as
to
be
worth
extracting
in
justice
to
the
writer
it
must
be
premised
that
the
preceding
part
of
this
chapter
was
penned
twelve
months
before
the
report
of
this
meeting
was
made
public
the
chairman
observed
that
he
was
glad
to
see
so
general
an
interest
elicited
on
this
subject
and
that
he
hoped
it
would
lead
to
some
practical
result
it
would
in
fact
be
impossible
to
aggravate
the
evil
for
neither
in
paris
berlin
new
york
nor
even
in
the
cities
of
asia
was
there
such
a
public
exhibition
of
profligacy
the
following
resolutions
were
submitted
and
adopted
that
a
deputation
do
wait
as
early
as
possible
upon
sir
george
grey
for
the
purpose
of
most
respectfully
but
earnestly
representing
to
her
majesty
government
the
necessity
of
effectual
measures
being
taken
to
put
down
the
open
exhibition
of
street
prostitution
which
in
various
parts
of
the
metropolis
particularly
in
the
important
thoroughfares
of
the
haymarket
coventry
street
regent
street
portland
place
and
other
adjacent
localities
is
carried
on
with
a
disregard
of
public
decency
and
to
an
extent
tolerated
in
no
other
capital
or
city
of
the
civilized
world
that
such
deputation
be
instructed
to
urge
upon
her
government
the
following
measures
whereby
it
is
believed
that
the
evil
complained
of
may
be
effectually
controlled
firstly
the
enforcement
upon
a
systematic
plan
and
by
means
of
a
department
of
the
police
specially
appointed
and
instructed
for
that
purpose
of
the
provisions
of
the
and
of
victoria
cap
in
reference
to
street
prostitution
which
provisions
have
in
certain
localities
been
heretofore
carried
out
with
the
best
effect
and
in
others
have
been
ineffectual
only
because
acted
upon
partially
and
not
upon
any
uniform
system
and
secondly
the
passing
an
act
for
licensing
and
placing
under
proper
regulations
as
to
supervision
and
hours
of
closing
all
houses
of
entertainment
or
for
the
supply
of
refreshments
intended
to
be
opened
to
the
public
after
a
certain
fixed
hour
it
being
matter
of
public
notoriety
that
the
houses
of
this
description
popularly
known
as
have
by
becoming
the
places
of
resort
of
crowds
of
prostitutes
and
other
idle
and
disorderly
persons
at
all
hours
of
the
night
greatly
contributed
to
the
present
disgraceful
exhibition
of
street
prostitution
that
the
attention
of
the
government
be
also
directed
to
the
number
of
foreign
prostitutes
systematically
imported
into
this
country
and
to
the
means
of
controlling
this
evil
the
substance
of
one
of
the
addresses
made
on
the
subject
was
as
follows
the
speaker
begged
to
remind
the
meeting
that
a
change
had
already
been
effected
through
the
action
of
the
police
in
the
aspect
of
the
haymarket
and
regent
street
heretofore
so
much
complained
of
the
sense
that
the
public
eye
was
upon
their
class
had
caused
a
corresponding
amendment
in
the
dress
and
demeanor
of
the
females
frequenting
those
streets
and
the
objects
of
this
association
were
so
far
in
good
train
strongly
oppressive
or
as
some
delicately
said
repressive
measures
could
only
be
carried
out
by
an
extent
of
police
interference
inconsistent
with
the
prejudices
of
english
people
who
were
indisposed
to
deny
a
large
extent
of
personal
freedom
to
persons
of
even
the
most
disorderly
classes
who
had
not
absolutely
forfeited
their
civil
rights
if
the
association
went
the
length
of
advocating
that
the
act
of
prostitution
should
involve
such
forfeiture
and
the
entire
riddance
of
london
streets
from
the
presence
of
prostitutes
they
would
soon
find
their
hands
over
full
unless
they
thought
it
possible
to
exterminate
the
vice
altogether
they
would
find
that
its
wholesale
clearance
from
the
streets
would
necessitate
registration
licensing
and
confinement
in
certain
authorized
quarters
or
streets
as
prevailed
abroad
but
such
restrictions
would
entail
a
more
ample
recognition
and
legalization
than
had
hitherto
obtained
and
so
ample
indeed
as
to
be
very
distasteful
to
what
was
called
the
religious
public
it
would
be
obviously
unjust
to
exempt
from
pressure
the
prosperous
harlot
while
a
miserable
vulgar
painted
outcast
was
consignable
because
she
stood
out
from
the
picture
somewhat
broadly
to
the
police
cell
and
the
bridewell
the
meeting
must
be
aware
that
there
was
already
abroad
among
the
lower
half
million
of
londoners
an
impression
that
the
police
was
already
strict
enough
and
that
this
opinion
was
shared
by
numbers
of
intelligent
men
neither
paupers
nor
criminals
they
must
remember
that
many
a
gentleman
of
character
had
passed
a
night
in
a
police
cell
for
interfering
in
the
defense
of
prostitutes
against
the
police
and
this
sentiment
would
deepen
very
dangerously
if
the
police
pressure
were
put
on
double
or
as
some
would
have
it
tenfold
the
very
policemen
too
men
sprung
from
the
same
class
of
society
as
those
female
offenders
were
as
likely
as
any
one
else
to
be
fainthearted
in
the
work
of
relieving
the
eyes
and
ears
of
gentility
from
the
presence
of
those
whose
situation
they
were
not
slow
to
trace
to
the
schemes
and
desires
of
the
genteel
class
he
did
not
think
that
the
power
of
discrimination
could
be
safely
intrusted
to
the
constables
of
the
metropolitan
police
and
the
association
of
certain
with
the
police
as
witnesses
as
hinted
at
by
one
of
the
delegates
would
soon
if
established
fall
into
desuetude
with
the
view
of
checking
the
evil
in
a
satisfactory
manner
he
would
recommend
the
institution
of
a
special
service
of
street
orderlies
or
regulators
in
uniform
a
superior
temperate
and
discreet
class
of
men
if
possible
whose
functions
should
be
to
observe
not
to
spy
upon
all
prostitutes
especially
those
of
the
order
and
whose
circulation
as
opposed
to
loitering
and
haunting
particular
spots
they
should
insist
upon
they
should
work
not
by
threats
but
by
entreaty
advice
suggestion
but
in
case
of
contumacy
should
have
the
right
to
call
in
the
regular
force
he
believed
that
the
right
of
entry
and
inspection
of
all
places
of
ill
fame
should
be
vested
in
the
home
secretary
and
his
delegates
and
this
would
be
attained
least
oppressively
by
a
proper
system
of
licensing
forced
concentration
would
not
be
tolerated
here
but
concentration
was
valuable
as
bringing
immorality
more
under
control
parochial
crusades
though
a
public
blessing
had
often
the
effect
of
spreading
corruption
it
was
recollected
at
cambridge
that
when
a
certain
proctor
made
very
frequent
descents
upon
the
hamlet
of
barnwall
where
much
of
the
parasitical
vices
of
that
university
had
taken
root
the
people
in
question
far
from
cure
or
conversion
merely
extended
their
radius
into
more
rural
villages
these
were
so
soon
corrupted
that
representations
were
addressed
to
the
university
by
the
parochial
clergy
praying
that
the
plague
of
barnwall
should
be
confined
to
its
old
bounds
and
not
let
loose
upon
their
simpler
parishes
it
was
notorious
that
the
same
kind
of
thing
followed
on
a
very
large
scale
the
expulsion
of
prostitutes
from
brussels
and
it
could
not
be
supposed
that
the
attempt
to
strangle
the
growth
of
immorality
by
broadcasting
its
seeds
which
was
found
impracticable
under
the
powerful
discipline
of
the
english
university
and
the
belgian
capital
could
answer
among
this
enormous
and
when
roused
unmanageable
population
the
evicted
of
norton
street
in
the
parish
of
all
souls
had
settled
quietly
down
in
the
next
parish
incompressible
as
water
the
vice
had
but
shifted
its
ground
and
from
a
really
moral
point
of
view
more
harm
than
good
had
accrued
from
the
change
these
remarks
do
not
call
for
any
amplification
a
few
days
after
the
meeting
a
leading
article
appeared
in
the
london
it
must
be
remembered
that
for
many
years
the
settled
policy
of
the
conductors
of
that
journal
has
been
to
make
it
rather
the
exponent
than
the
leader
of
public
opinion
and
the
importance
generally
attached
to
it
arises
from
a
knowledge
of
this
fact
we
give
the
article
almost
entire
there
is
a
very
disagreeable
subject
which
we
are
compelled
to
bring
although
most
reluctantly
before
the
notice
of
the
public
because
it
has
become
necessary
to
bring
public
opinion
to
bear
upon
it
many
clergymen
and
gentlemen
are
now
associating
themselves
together
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
in
some
degree
with
the
notorious
evil
of
street
prostitution
it
is
our
earnest
desire
to
give
them
all
the
support
in
our
power
so
long
as
they
confine
themselves
to
reasonable
measures
of
discouragement
and
repression
let
us
not
nourish
any
visionary
expectations
it
would
be
simply
idle
to
suppose
that
the
evil
against
which
we
are
now
directing
our
efforts
can
be
put
down
by
the
strong
hand
of
power
it
is
with
moral
as
with
physical
disease
there
is
no
use
in
looking
for
an
entirely
satisfactory
result
from
the
treatment
of
symptoms
there
may
be
alleviation
there
may
be
diminution
of
the
disorder
but
there
will
be
no
perfect
cure
tends
to
raise
the
standard
of
public
morality
will
also
tend
to
diminish
in
such
a
case
we
are
dealing
with
two
parties
the
tempter
let
us
say
and
the
tempted
with
the
man
and
with
the
woman
it
is
probably
with
the
first
of
the
two
that
we
should
principally
concern
ourselves
if
we
would
bring
about
any
serious
result
it
is
on
the
sacred
action
of
family
life
with
the
thousand
influences
it
brings
to
bear
upon
the
minds
and
conduct
of
men
that
we
must
chiefly
depend
if
we
would
see
any
notable
diminution
in
the
numbers
of
those
unfortunate
creatures
who
now
parade
our
streets
let
it
be
once
understood
that
even
among
a
fellows
and
associates
immorality
is
a
thing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
at
least
we
should
get
rid
of
the
contagion
of
vice
time
was
and
the
time
is
not
a
very
remote
one
when
a
british
gentleman
we
speak
of
all
three
home
divisions
of
the
empire
would
nightly
stagger
or
be
carried
up
to
his
bed
fuddled
if
not
absolutely
drunk
a
man
who
should
thus
expose
himself
in
our
own
days
would
be
set
down
as
a
beast
and
his
society
would
be
avoided
by
all
who
set
store
on
their
own
good
name
in
this
respect
there
has
been
a
palpable
improvement
in
the
manners
of
the
age
surely
public
opinion
can
be
brought
to
bear
against
one
vice
as
well
as
another
the
time
may
come
when
a
man
may
shrink
from
presenting
himself
in
the
sacred
circle
of
his
mother
his
sisters
and
his
other
female
relatives
reeking
from
secret
immorality
conscience
can
turn
on
a
bull
eye
as
well
as
a
policeman
and
the
culprit
may
stand
although
no
one
has
been
there
to
convict
him
save
himself
the
influences
however
of
which
we
speak
are
of
slow
growth
and
can
not
be
much
quickened
by
the
hand
of
power
it
has
become
necessary
to
deal
at
once
with
certain
results
now
we
say
it
with
much
shame
that
in
no
capital
city
of
europe
is
there
daily
and
nightly
such
a
shameless
display
of
prostitution
as
in
london
at
paris
at
vienna
at
berlin
as
every
one
knows
there
is
plenty
of
vice
but
at
least
it
is
not
allowed
to
parade
the
streets
to
tempt
the
weak
to
offend
and
disgust
all
persons
if
any
one
would
see
the
evil
of
which
we
speak
in
its
full
development
let
him
pass
along
the
haymarket
and
its
neighborhood
at
night
when
the
and
the
are
open
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
to
make
your
way
along
without
molestation
in
regent
street
in
the
strand
in
fleet
street
the
same
nuisance
but
in
a
less
degree
prevails
now
we
are
well
aware
that
if
all
the
unfortunate
creatures
who
parade
these
localities
were
swept
away
if
the
and
were
closed
by
the
police
we
should
not
have
really
suppressed
immorality
we
should
however
have
removed
the
evil
from
the
sight
of
those
who
are
disgusted
and
annoyed
by
its
display
and
still
more
we
should
have
removed
it
from
the
sight
of
those
who
probably
had
they
not
been
tempted
by
the
sight
of
these
opportunities
would
not
have
fallen
now
as
one
practical
measure
for
the
discouragement
of
prostitution
all
these
and
others
might
be
placed
under
the
surveillance
of
the
police
licenses
for
opening
them
and
keeping
them
open
might
be
given
only
in
the
cases
of
persons
who
offered
some
guarantees
of
their
respectability
they
might
be
compelled
to
close
at
certain
hours
in
point
of
fact
the
community
could
tolerate
any
degree
of
inconvenience
inflicted
upon
their
frequenters
in
two
other
analogous
cases
similar
evils
have
been
dealt
with
in
this
way
and
with
the
happiest
results
we
speak
of
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
persons
who
are
firmly
resolved
to
play
and
to
bet
will
effect
their
purpose
even
now
but
at
least
the
sum
of
the
evils
resulting
from
these
two
vices
has
been
greatly
diminished
since
the
community
has
resolved
to
withdraw
from
them
its
recognition
england
should
not
grant
her
to
prostitution
this
is
one
thing
which
might
be
tried
another
would
be
to
give
increased
force
to
clauses
which
as
we
believe
already
exist
in
police
acts
by
which
the
police
are
empowered
to
stop
the
solicitation
and
gathering
together
of
prostitutes
in
the
public
streets
in
such
a
case
we
must
trample
down
definitions
and
exceptional
cases
with
an
elephant
foot
and
go
straight
for
results
the
rule
in
all
such
cases
is
to
give
the
power
and
to
leave
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
authorities
only
to
employ
it
on
proper
occasions
we
have
ample
guarantees
nowadays
that
such
discretion
can
not
be
abused
here
then
are
two
things
which
may
be
done
without
opening
any
visionary
trenches
the
police
may
be
directed
to
deal
with
prostitutes
as
they
do
with
mendicants
and
the
centres
of
pollution
may
be
brought
under
proper
regulation
we
know
well
enough
that
in
such
a
capital
as
london
it
is
hopeless
to
expect
that
vice
of
this
description
can
be
expunged
altogether
from
the
catalogue
of
our
national
sins
but
at
least
let
as
many
difficulties
as
possible
be
thrown
in
its
way
again
the
benevolent
persons
who
have
taken
it
in
hand
to
deal
with
this
monstrous
evil
assert
that
the
introduction
of
foreign
prostitutes
or
what
is
still
worse
of
girls
yet
uncontaminated
for
the
purposes
of
prostitution
might
be
discouraged
much
more
than
it
is
perhaps
totally
prevented
undoubtedly
england
does
not
desire
free
trade
in
prostitution
preventive
measures
upon
this
subject
are
surrounded
with
difficulties
but
that
is
no
reason
for
despair
but
one
for
additional
exertion
very
numerous
and
influential
meetings
have
been
held
upon
this
subject
and
we
augur
well
of
their
success
there
was
no
display
of
rigor
no
attempt
to
deal
with
impossibilities
the
speakers
in
the
main
contended
that
the
public
exhibition
of
prostitution
might
be
successfully
dealt
with
even
if
the
vice
were
beyond
their
reach
our
streets
at
least
can
be
purged
of
the
public
scandal
the
disgraceful
may
be
deprived
of
their
powers
of
corruption
the
keepers
of
brothels
may
be
brought
under
the
lash
of
the
law
and
the
importation
of
foreign
prostitutes
may
be
diminished
if
not
put
down
altogether
if
the
public
will
take
the
subject
up
in
earnest
such
were
the
principal
points
on
which
the
speakers
insisted
at
least
their
views
deserve
a
trial
this
plan
is
calculated
to
restrict
prostitution
by
placing
it
under
it
requires
no
additional
licensing
system
as
every
public
house
or
in
london
whether
kept
open
at
day
or
night
whether
of
a
respectable
or
immoral
class
requires
a
license
under
the
excise
laws
the
proposals
just
quoted
urge
that
the
permission
to
keep
these
places
of
entertainment
should
be
limited
and
given
only
in
the
cases
of
persons
who
offered
some
guarantees
of
their
respectability
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
reader
to
bear
in
mind
that
are
not
houses
of
prostitution
but
merely
resorts
for
prostitutes
as
already
mentioned
as
in
default
of
this
a
natural
construction
would
be
that
the
proposed
to
license
brothels
the
two
are
as
distinct
as
possible
and
it
would
be
as
consistent
to
style
some
of
the
fashionable
and
restaurants
of
new
york
houses
of
ill
fame
because
abandoned
women
resort
to
them
as
to
class
the
of
london
in
that
catalogue
they
are
simply
places
for
public
refreshment
in
the
neighborhoods
of
theatres
markets
which
are
permitted
to
continue
open
all
night
in
deference
to
a
supposed
public
requirement
and
though
from
the
character
of
their
visitants
they
can
not
be
considered
schools
of
morality
or
decency
yet
no
prostitution
takes
place
in
them
the
interests
of
the
proprietors
guard
against
this
as
it
would
immediately
cause
the
licenses
to
be
revoked
and
consequently
close
the
place
entirely
by
placing
the
resorts
of
london
prostitutes
under
this
restriction
much
would
be
gained
so
far
as
the
public
decency
of
the
streets
and
the
transit
of
passengers
are
concerned
but
no
possible
check
would
be
imposed
on
the
ravages
of
disease
the
proposition
at
the
meeting
to
license
the
brothels
would
do
this
but
as
was
anticipated
by
the
speaker
it
would
be
very
distasteful
to
the
religious
public
and
the
act
of
recognition
would
be
immediately
construed
as
an
act
of
approval
or
at
least
of
sanction
that
it
would
not
merit
this
censure
must
be
evident
the
only
approval
or
sanction
given
to
the
vice
would
in
fact
consist
in
saying
to
the
keepers
of
houses
of
ill
fame
we
shall
not
attempt
to
close
your
doors
for
we
know
that
would
be
impossible
but
we
shall
claim
the
right
of
entry
at
any
moment
to
watch
your
proceedings
it
has
ever
been
an
unquestioned
policy
to
choose
the
least
of
two
evils
when
you
must
take
one
and
if
the
british
government
should
ever
license
brothels
they
will
certainly
adopt
the
theory
to
the
population
of
london
less
danger
would
inure
from
this
toleration
than
from
the
unknown
unwatched
courtesans
who
haunt
their
streets
many
an
apparently
respectable
man
will
follow
a
woman
into
a
house
of
prostitution
when
it
is
conducted
quietly
and
furtively
who
would
hesitate
before
he
accompanied
her
into
a
known
and
licensed
brothel
while
many
a
stranger
who
may
date
his
physical
ruin
and
possibly
the
loss
of
character
and
honor
from
the
hour
when
he
entered
a
private
house
of
prostitution
would
be
saved
many
a
bitter
memory
had
an
official
recognition
of
its
true
character
met
him
on
its
threshold
and
intimated
that
it
was
the
resort
of
the
abandoned
and
vicious
in
london
as
in
new
york
we
do
not
believe
that
illicit
sexual
intercourse
can
be
carried
to
any
greater
extent
than
it
is
now
so
no
danger
of
an
increase
of
vice
need
be
apprehended
there
from
any
measures
calculated
to
remove
some
of
the
ulterior
and
fatal
effects
of
dissipation
in
contrast
to
the
public
display
of
immorality
in
the
streets
of
london
is
the
following
description
of
prostitution
in
paris
it
is
extracted
from
the
foreign
correspondence
of
a
new
york
journal
paris
thursday
may
in
a
late
letter
on
the
subject
of
the
of
the
foundling
hospitals
i
spoke
of
the
repugnance
of
protestant
communities
to
any
official
compromise
with
one
sin
in
order
even
to
destroy
a
greater
for
that
the
secret
reception
of
illegitimate
children
by
the
state
does
contribute
enormously
to
the
extinction
of
the
crime
of
infanticide
while
it
does
not
generally
increase
the
number
of
these
unfortunate
children
is
too
well
shown
by
statistics
to
remain
longer
a
question
for
discussion
but
we
have
another
and
a
more
striking
example
of
this
repugnance
to
a
collusion
with
one
evil
in
order
to
smother
out
another
and
a
greater
in
the
want
of
legislation
in
protestant
countries
on
the
subject
of
prostitution
for
many
months
as
you
know
the
municipality
officers
the
and
the
journals
of
london
have
been
excited
over
this
very
question
of
prostitution
and
no
wonder
one
need
but
to
leave
paris
and
fall
suddenly
in
the
streets
of
london
at
an
advanced
hour
of
the
evening
to
comprehend
the
excitement
of
its
citizens
on
this
subject
to
the
frenchman
crossing
the
channel
is
like
crossing
the
river
styx
he
falls
suddenly
into
a
pandemonium
of
street
disorder
and
drunken
licentiousness
for
which
he
is
not
prepared
he
recalls
mery
terrible
picture
in
and
does
not
find
it
overdrawn
he
sees
nothing
like
this
in
his
own
city
and
he
is
surprised
beyond
measure
for
he
has
been
taught
to
believe
in
the
puritanism
of
protestant
countries
when
an
american
or
an
englishman
habituated
to
the
revolting
of
new
york
or
london
first
arrives
in
paris
he
is
astonished
at
the
absolute
absence
of
similar
scenes
in
our
streets
he
has
perhaps
arrived
here
with
the
impression
most
foreigners
do
that
prostitution
and
revelry
and
drunken
debauchery
stalk
forth
in
the
day
and
render
hideous
the
night
but
he
forgets
that
he
has
arrived
in
a
city
where
there
are
laws
and
a
police
to
execute
them
in
a
city
where
refinement
and
the
proprieties
of
life
are
carried
to
their
extreme
perfection
and
where
such
license
and
debauchery
as
prevails
in
english
and
american
cities
would
be
an
absolute
contradiction
to
the
spirit
and
habits
of
the
people
the
reader
will
please
observe
that
i
do
not
speak
of
the
morals
of
the
people
but
of
their
ideas
of
decorum
and
of
the
proprieties
of
life
of
what
is
due
to
decency
and
an
ordinary
respect
for
appearances
this
extreme
attention
to
appearances
is
in
fact
one
of
the
principal
attractions
of
a
residence
in
paris
the
city
is
not
only
maintained
free
of
inanimate
filth
but
of
animate
filth
as
well
at
least
you
are
not
forced
to
see
it
if
you
do
not
wish
to
in
london
no
lady
dare
walk
out
unattended
after
in
the
evening
and
after
she
will
have
her
eyes
and
ears
insulted
no
matter
how
well
attended
while
in
paris
she
may
remain
in
the
streets
to
any
hour
of
the
night
and
neither
have
her
eyes
offended
nor
her
ears
insulted
how
is
this
happy
result
accomplished
in
the
official
register
of
the
police
of
paris
showed
public
girls
on
its
books
the
number
now
may
be
stated
at
these
girls
and
the
houses
in
which
they
live
are
subjected
to
a
series
of
stringent
laws
which
renders
them
innoxious
and
inoffensive
to
the
community
the
police
adopting
the
principle
that
since
it
is
impossible
to
suppress
the
evil
it
should
be
rendered
as
inoffensive
to
the
public
eye
and
to
the
public
salubrity
as
possible
all
these
houses
are
obliged
to
be
closed
at
precisely
the
girls
are
obliged
to
remain
in
the
house
and
the
windows
are
always
covered
with
blinds
night
and
day
a
few
girls
are
permitted
here
and
there
to
walk
up
and
down
in
front
of
their
door
from
to
precisely
but
it
is
against
the
law
to
accost
the
the
houses
are
visited
once
a
week
by
a
medical
and
an
ordinary
inspector
real
inspectors
appointed
by
government
and
not
humbugging
ward
politicians
another
class
of
girls
and
much
the
larger
class
are
those
who
frequent
the
public
balls
concerts
and
theatres
girls
who
live
alone
in
public
and
who
for
the
most
part
are
not
enrolled
on
the
nor
submitted
to
the
ordinary
sanitary
regulations
but
this
class
are
no
more
permitted
than
the
rest
either
in
the
street
or
at
their
favorite
evening
resorts
to
accost
people
for
purposes
of
commerce
the
streets
and
the
public
balls
are
full
of
policemen
in
citizen
dress
whose
business
it
is
to
detect
such
girls
as
violate
the
law
in
regard
to
addressing
people
and
to
put
their
names
on
the
thus
requiring
them
to
take
out
a
license
and
to
submit
to
all
the
police
regulations
on
the
new
class
to
which
they
have
entered
as
a
girl
regards
herself
as
forever
lost
when
her
name
is
once
placed
on
the
and
as
she
never
knows
when
an
officer
eye
may
be
upon
her
she
takes
good
care
to
violate
as
rarely
as
possible
this
law
prohibiting
solicitations
in
public
this
class
are
always
elegantly
dressed
it
is
notorious
even
that
they
are
the
first
to
initiate
and
to
propagate
those
very
fashions
which
make
the
tour
of
the
world
as
the
latest
paris
modes
many
of
them
are
reserved
and
elegant
in
their
manners
and
require
a
punctiliousness
of
etiquette
which
would
not
be
out
of
place
in
the
most
aristocratic
saloon
but
one
of
the
great
aids
to
the
paris
police
in
the
maintenance
of
public
decency
in
this
class
is
the
fact
that
they
do
not
use
strong
drinks
a
drunken
public
woman
is
never
seen
as
liquor
is
the
greatest
debaser
of
mankind
this
one
fact
strikes
out
a
marked
line
of
distinction
between
this
class
here
and
in
england
and
the
united
states
the
great
majority
do
not
lose
their
and
they
take
good
care
of
their
health
hoping
later
on
to
reform
and
get
married
this
is
here
the
rule
whereas
in
england
and
the
united
states
they
throw
themselves
away
as
rapidly
as
possible
it
is
thus
that
the
fashionable
promenades
of
paris
the
public
balls
and
the
gardens
even
may
be
frequented
by
ladies
and
children
at
all
hours
of
the
evening
and
night
without
once
seeing
any
of
those
offensive
movements
of
public
women
so
common
in
the
streets
of
english
and
american
cities
contrast
this
state
of
things
with
that
of
london
let
the
reader
if
he
has
ever
lived
there
recall
to
mind
the
strand
the
haymarket
piccadilly
leicester
square
and
regent
street
the
fashionable
business
quarters
of
the
city
one
hesitates
to
enter
upon
a
description
of
such
a
scene
it
refreshes
his
historical
recollections
of
the
decadence
of
rome
his
name
should
be
plato
to
look
upon
such
sights
the
streets
swarm
with
drunken
and
young
girls
often
mere
children
and
when
i
say
swarm
i
mean
that
you
have
to
push
your
way
to
get
through
them
is
it
then
strange
that
the
citizens
of
london
should
feel
scandalized
at
this
state
of
things
or
that
its
journals
or
its
should
seek
to
find
a
remedy
for
the
nuisance
they
will
think
of
every
thing
else
before
they
arrive
at
the
simple
and
beautifully
working
paris
system
because
they
are
a
protestant
people
and
must
not
compromise
with
a
sin
it
must
be
left
to
find
its
own
level
honorable
citizens
must
consent
to
allow
their
sons
often
their
families
to
come
in
contact
with
these
demoralizing
horrors
of
the
streets
they
must
suffer
individually
and
as
a
community
from
the
vile
tendencies
of
street
prostitution
because
they
hesitate
to
legalize
it
and
to
give
it
over
to
the
care
of
the
police
to
see
the
finest
evening
promenades
of
a
protestant
and
christian
city
given
up
exclusively
to
the
unutterable
shames
and
horrors
of
is
a
problem
in
the
catalogue
of
inconsistencies
which
catholic
and
infidel
france
can
not
fathom
in
france
the
law
acts
on
the
principle
that
for
a
public
woman
to
be
seen
in
the
street
is
an
insult
to
public
taste
and
hence
when
it
is
necessary
for
these
girls
to
be
conveyed
to
prison
to
the
hospital
or
to
the
dispensary
of
the
prefecture
of
police
they
are
mounted
in
close
carriages
constructed
for
the
purpose
or
when
by
hazard
they
are
obliged
to
take
a
public
they
are
required
to
keep
the
blinds
down
you
may
say
what
you
please
about
the
of
the
french
but
their
respect
for
the
public
eye
does
honor
to
their
civilization
and
their
law
on
this
evil
would
be
well
adopted
elsewhere
there
is
no
truer
principle
in
civil
government
than
that
the
moral
sores
of
society
should
be
hidden
as
much
as
possible
from
the
public
view
for
it
is
now
too
late
in
the
day
to
combat
the
maxim
long
ago
put
in
print
by
pope
that
vice
is
propagated
by
a
familiarity
with
it
the
french
law
may
be
culpable
in
permitting
masked
balls
and
the
keeping
of
concubines
but
these
are
affairs
that
belong
to
the
interior
which
the
public
need
not
see
if
they
do
not
wish
to
the
important
distinction
is
that
the
french
law
does
not
compel
an
honest
father
of
a
family
in
returning
from
church
or
theatre
to
push
his
way
through
mobs
of
drunken
lewd
women
who
salute
his
children
ears
with
language
they
ought
never
to
hear
in
one
of
its
last
articles
on
the
general
subject
of
prostitution
the
london
makes
some
judicious
remarks
which
are
completely
verified
in
the
same
class
in
paris
thus
the
declares
that
the
proper
method
of
diminishing
the
number
of
these
unfortunates
for
to
think
of
eradicating
the
evil
is
an
illusion
is
not
by
missionary
efforts
directed
to
them
but
rather
to
their
poor
parents
for
these
poor
girls
were
raised
in
sin
and
made
a
the
same
thing
holds
good
here
hundredths
of
all
the
public
women
of
paris
are
born
and
raised
in
filthiness
of
mind
and
body
at
the
age
of
ten
twelve
and
fourteen
years
they
are
already
prostitutes
and
thieves
and
when
they
get
their
first
silk
dress
their
first
fine
toilet
earned
in
their
shameful
profession
they
take
a
step
higher
in
the
scale
of
morality
for
then
they
cease
to
steal
they
acquire
a
certain
degree
of
pride
in
their
conduct
they
are
more
respectful
and
decently
behaved
so
that
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
the
immense
majority
of
the
public
women
of
paris
instead
of
making
a
fall
have
actually
been
promoted
in
the
scale
of
morality
but
all
these
women
know
nothing
else
than
the
life
in
which
they
have
been
raised
they
are
fit
for
nothing
else
they
are
incorrigibly
averse
to
all
the
moral
suasion
that
can
be
addressed
to
them
and
the
real
remedy
is
an
enlightenment
of
the
parents
of
such
children
a
general
improvement
in
the
moral
tone
of
the
lowest
classes
in
fine
if
it
is
an
evil
which
can
not
be
eradicated
if
the
children
of
beggars
and
and
will
fall
into
it
is
right
to
protect
society
at
least
from
the
public
demonstration
of
their
vile
occupation
by
the
passage
of
effective
police
laws
as
an
indication
that
the
sentiments
advanced
in
this
chapter
are
entertained
by
others
of
the
medical
profession
and
as
endorsing
our
views
to
a
considerable
extent
the
reader

is

to
the

board
bellevue

gentlemen
i
am
led
to
believe
that
a
large
number
of
the
inmates
of
bellevue
hospital
are
affected
with
syphilis
in
some
of
its
many
forms
and
believing
that
the
governors
of
the
are
called
upon
to
take
measures
to
remove
as
far
as
possible
the
cause
of
this
great
malady
to
dry
up
the
sources
of
an
evil
which
prevails
so
extensively
saps
the
health
and
taxes
the
wealth
of
the
city
largely
and
believing
farther
that
if
the
vice
can
not
be
stayed
humanity
as
well
as
policy
would
suggest
that
the
dangers
which
surround
it
can
be
lessened
i
propose
a
few
interrogatories
tending
toward
the
accomplishment
of
this
great
object
desiring
your
views
upon
them
in
reply
as
early
as
of
october
what
percentage
of
the
total
number
of
patients
admitted
to
bellevue
hospital
suffer
directly
or
indirectly
from
syphilis
are
there
not
patients
admitted
to
bellevue
hospital
whose
diseases
are
attributable
to
the
taint
of
syphilis
and
have
not
many
of
the
inmates
been
forced
to
place
themselves
under
treatment
therein
and
thus
become
dependent
on
the
city
from
being
unfitted
in
body
and
mind
for
the
ordinary
duties
of
life
in
consequence
of
syphilitic
diseases
are
not
the
children
of
parents
thus
affected
unhealthy
what
means
in
your
opinion
could
be
adopted
to
eradicate
or
lessen
the
disease
in
the
city
by
giving
the
above
queries
your
earliest
attention
you
will
greatly
oblige
your
very
obedient
servant
isaac

president
at
a
special
meeting
of
the
medical
board
of
bellevue

held

the

report
in

to
a
letter
from
isaac

president
of
the
board
of

of

touching
the
subjects

was

the
committee
appointed
by
the
medical

to
consider
and
reply
to
said
letter
on

the
report
was
accepted

ordered
for

report
on
prostitution
and
syphilis
to
isaac
townsend
president
of
the
board
of
governors
of
the
in
answer
to
your
inquiries
the
medical
board
of
bellevue
hospital
respectfully
reply
that
they
caused
a
census
of
the
hospital
to
be
taken
on
the
october
last
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
what
proportion
of
the
patients
had
suffered
from
venereal
diseases
from
that
enumeration
they
learn
that
out
of
persons
then
under
medical
and
surgical
treatment
or
about
one
third
had
been
so
affected
in
the
several
divisions
of
the
house
the
numbers
are
as
follows
viz
of
females
on
the
surgical
side
or
in
of
females
on
the
medical
side
or
in
nearly
of
males
on
the
medical
side
or
in
of
males
on
the
surgical
side
or
in
so
that
out
of
males
then
under
treatment
or
in
had
had
some
form
of
venereal
disease
and
among
females
or
in
had
been
similarly
affected
of
the
whole
number
who
confessed
that
they
had
had
affections
of
this
class
had
had
syphilis
and
had
had
gonorrhoea
of
the
who
had
had
syphilis
or
just
one
half
were
still
laboring
under
the
influence
of
the
poison
with
which
they
had
been
inoculated
in
many
instances
years
before
as
almost
all
these
patients
were
admitted
for
other
diseases
or
with
affections
which
the
physician
alone
would
recognize
as
the
remote
effects
of
syphilis
it
is
perhaps
fair
to
assume
that
they
represent
with
some
exaggeration
the
class
of
society
from
which
they
come
the
board
has
been
favored
with
the
census
of
the
new
york
hospital
broadway
taken
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
proportion
of
syphilitic
cases
among
the
patients
of
that
institution
from
which
it
appears
that
the
whole
number
of
patients
on
the
of
december
was
and
that
of
that
number
had
had
venereal
disease
and
were
then
under
treatment
for
the
same
affections
recently
contracted
counting
the
old
cases
alone
most
of
which
were
admitted
probably
for
other
diseases
this
proportion
considerably
exceeds
that
above
recorded
for
bellevue
hospital
it
being
as
high
as
in
it
is
proper
however
in
this
connection
to
state
that
the
returns
for
bellevue
hospital
are
believed
to
be
incomplete
they
are
based
in
a
considerable
degree
on
the
confessions
of
the
patients
and
it
is
known
that
many
especially
among
the
women
have
denied
any
contamination
when
facts
subsequently
developed
have
shown
that
their
statements
were
not
true
is
it
to
be
believed
then
that
one
in
three
or
even
one
in
four
of
that
large
class
of
our
population
whose
circumstances
compel
them
to
seek
the
occasional
aid
of
medical
charities
are
tainted
with
venereal
poison
this
the
medical
board
do
not
think
they
are
authorized
to
state
but
the
facts
here
cited
and
others
within
their
reach
justify
them
in
saying
that
venereal
diseases
prevail
to
an
alarming
extent
among
the
poor
of
the
city
the
large
number
of
women
sent
by
the
police
courts
to
be
treated
for
these
diseases
at
the
penitentiary
hospital
would
alone
be
sufficient
evidence
of
this
yet
such
persons
constitute
but
a
small
proportion
of
those
who
even
among
the
poor
suffer
from
these
disorders
dispensary
physicians
and
those
in
private
practice
can
show
a
much
longer
list
of
the
victims
of
impure
intercourse
but
the
disease
is
not
confined
to
this
class
the
advertisements
which
crowd
the
newspapers
introduced
by
men
who
their
practice
to
one
class
of
disease
in
which
they
treated
twenty
thousand
cases
more
or
less
demonstrate
how
large
is
the
company
of
irregulars
who
live
and
grow
rich
on
the
harvest
of
these
grapes
of
sodom
and
yet
their
long
list
of
would
disclose
but
a
fraction
of
the
evil
among
those
who
are
able
to
pay
for
medical
services
the
medical
board
are
unable
to
state
what
proportion
of
the
income
of
regular
and
qualified
physicians
in
this
city
is
derived
from
the
treatment
of
venereal
diseases
but
they
know
it
is
large
and
that
many
who
never
advertise
their
skill
receive
more
from
this
source
than
from
all
other
sources
together
they
believe
that
there
is
no
one
among
the
unavoidable
diseases
however
prevalent
for
the
treatment
of
which
the
citizens
of
new
york
pay
one
half
so
much
as
they
pay
to
be
relieved
from
the
consequences
of
their
illicit
pleasures
the
city
bills
of
mortality
give
little
information
regarding
the
frequency
of
venereal
affections
keeps
its
place
in
the
tables
and
counts
its
score
or
two
of
deaths
annually
although
this
class
of
disorders
is
not
frequently
fatal
except
among
children
it
is
credited
with
only
a
fraction
of
the
work
it
actually
performs
the
physician
does
not
feel
called
upon
in
his
return
of
the
causes
of
death
to
brand
his
patient
memory
with
disgrace
or
to
record
an
accusation
against
near
relatives
during
infancy
the
real
disease
is
buried
under
such
terms
as
marasmus
atrophia
infantile
debility
or
inflammation
while
in
adults
inflammation
of
the
throat
phagedæna
ulceration
scrofula
and
the
like
take
the
responsibility
of
the
death
these
affections
are
strictly
what
the
advertisers
denominate
them
diseases
a
leprosy
which
the
always
strives
to
conceal
and
so
long
as
it
spares
his
speech
and
countenance
usually
succeeds
in
concealing
the
physician
is
his
only
confidant
and
the
physician
refers
all
to
the
class
of
secrets
which
are
not
to
be
revealed
the
public
therefore
know
little
of
the
prevalence
of
such
diseases
and
still
less
of
the
fearful
ravages
they
are
capable
of
making
still
as
has
been
just
said
syphilis
is
not
often
the
immediate
cause
of
death
in
adults
after
its
first
local
effects
are
over
and
these
though
generally
mild
are
sometimes
frightful
the
poison
lingers
in
the
system
ready
to
break
out
on
any
provocation
in
some
one
of
its
many
disgusting
manifestations
often
deforming
and
branding
its
victim
threatening
life
and
making
it
a
burden
and
yet
refusing
the
poor
consolation
of
a
grave
like
the
vulture
which
fed
on
the
entrails
of
the
too
amorous
tityus
it
tortures
and
consumes
but
is
slow
to
destroy
and
often
its
visible
brand
like
the
scarlet
badge
once
worn
by
the
adulteress
proclaims
a
lasting
disgrace
the
protracted
suffering
of
mind
and
body
produced
by
this
class
of
distempers
the
and
often
loathsome
form
of
their
secondary
accidents
and
the
almost
irradicable
character
of
the
poison
seem
almost
to
justify
an
old
opinion
sanctioned
by
a
papal
bull
as
late
as
that
these
diseases
are
an
avenging
plague
appointed
by
heaven
as
a
special
punishment
for
a
special
sin
the
relentless
character
of
syphilitic
diseases
stands
out
in
painful
relief
in
its
transmission
from
parent
to
offspring
here
it
is
indeed
that
the
children
teeth
are
set
on
edge
because
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
the
contaminated
husband
or
wife
is
left
through
years
of
childlessness
or
of
successive
bereavements
to
mourn
over
early
follies
and
to
repent
when
repentance
is
fruitless
the
syphilitic
man
or
woman
can
hardly
become
the
parent
of
a
healthy
child
a
young
man
has
imbibed
the
contagion
it
has
become
constitutional
after
a
few
weeks
or
months
perhaps
of
treatment
the
visible
signs
of
the
disease
no
longer
torment
him
he
has
contracted
a
matrimonial
alliance
and
soon
marries
a
healthy
and
virtuous
woman
he
flatters
himself
that
he
is
cured
a
few
months
suffice
to
give
him
painful
proof
of
his
error
for
then
his
growing
hopes
of
paternity
are
suddenly
blasted
instead
of
the
child
of
his
hopes
he
sees
a
shriveled
and
leprous
corpse
this
is
but
the
first
in
a
series
of
similar
misfortunes
he
has
poisoned
the
fruit
of
his
loins
and
again
and
again
and
still
again
it
falls
withered
and
dead
at
length
nature
seems
to
have
triumphed
over
this
foe
to
domestic
happiness
and
the
parents
hearts
are
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
a
living
child
their
joy
is
the
child
is
feeble
and
sickly
and
in
a
few
days
or
weeks
another
death
is
added
to
the
penance
list
of
the
humbled
and
grieving
father
this
mournful
story
will
need
no
essential
changes
in
the
narration
should
the
poison
of
impure
intercourse
legitimate
or
illicit
linger
in
the
veins
of
the
mother
a
child
of
such
a
connection
may
be
born
in
apparent
health
but
before
six
months
have
passed
some
one
of
the
numerous
forms
of
infantile
syphilis
will
be
likely
to
appear
and
threaten
its
life
in
the
contest
which
follows
between
disease
and
the
treatment
the
physician
is
commonly
victorious
but
the
contest
is
in
many
cases
protracted
and
often
it
is
to
be
renewed
again
and
again
and
after
all
it
is
not
believed
that
children
thus
tainted
at
their
birth
often
grow
up
and
acquire
that
degree
of
health
and
vigor
which
is
popularly
ascribed
to
a
these
are
facts
familiar
to
physicians
practicing
in
large
towns
but
the
history
of
inherited
syphilis
is
not
complete
if
in
the
case
just
recited
the
wife
escape
contamination
from
her
husband
and
her
unborn
child
yet
the
sad
consequences
of
that
husband
folly
are
not
yet
exhausted
that
tainted
child
now
a
sickly
nursling
at
her
breast
has
a
venom
in
its
ulcerated
lips
which
can
inoculate
the
mother
with
its
own
loathsome
poison
while
it
draws
its
sustenance
from
the
sacred
fountain
of
infantile
life
but
this
is
not
all
these
little
innocents
sometimes
spread
their
disease
through
the
whole
circle
of
those
who
bestow
on
them
their
care
and
kindness
the
contagion
spreads
through
the
use
of
the
same
spoon
the
same
linen
and
even
by
that
highest
token
of
affection
a
kiss
it
has
been
known
that
a
single
diseased
child
has
contaminated
its
mother
a
hired
nurse
and
through
that
nurse
the
nurse
child
and
in
addition
to
these
the
husband
mother
and
the
mother
sister
such
are
sometimes
the
weighty
consequences
of
a
single
error
prevention
that
the
great
source
of
the
venereal
poison
is
prostitution
requires
no
argument
the
first
question
then
to
be
answered
is
can
prostitution
be
prevented
in
answering
this
question
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
the
history
of
the
world
demonstrates
the
existence
of
this
vice
in
all
ages
and
among
all
nations
since
the
day
its
first
pages
were
written
the
appetite
which
incites
it
has
always
been
stronger
than
moral
restraints
stronger
than
the
law
no
rigor
of
punishment
no
violence
of
public
denunciation
neither
exile
nor
the
dungeon
nor
yet
the
disgusting
malady
with
which
nature
punishes
the
practice
has
ever
effected
its
extermination
even
for
a
single
year
great
as
this
evil
has
always
been
it
can
not
be
denied
that
in
our
own
time
some
of
the
accidents
of
what
is
called
progress
of
tend
at
least
in
large
towns
greatly
to
increase
it
the
expenses
of
living
are
every
where
the
great
obstacle
to
early
marriages
whether
such
expenses
be
positively
necessary
or
be
demanded
by
the
social
position
of
the
individual
the
fashion
of
his
class
and
therefore
become
relatively
necessary
wherever
these
expenses
increase
more
rapidly
than
the
rewards
of
labor
marriage
becomes
impossible
for
a
constantly
increasing
number
or
can
only
be
purchased
at
the
price
of
social
position
but
abstinence
from
marriage
does
not
abolish
or
moderate
the
natural
appetites
the
great
law
of
nature
on
which
the
existence
of
the
race
depends
is
not
abrogated
by
any
artificial
state
of
society
moral
or
religious
principles
will
restrain
its
operations
in
some
human
laws
in
some
the
fear
of
consequences
in
some
yet
there
always
have
been
and
probably
always
will
be
many
of
both
sexes
who
are
not
restrained
by
any
of
these
considerations
these
have
sustained
and
probably
will
continue
to
sustain
not
only
prostitution
but
houses
of
prostitution
in
the
face
of
every
human
law
suppressed
in
one
form
it
immediately
assumes
another
again
pursued
it
retreats
to
where
darkness
and
secrecy
protect
it
from
the
pursuer
severe
penalties
have
heretofore
only
increased
the
evils
of
prostitution
if
a
hundred
women
are
consigned
to
prison
for
this
vice
before
a
month
has
elapsed
a
hundred
more
have
taken
their
places
and
the
hundred
though
punished
are
not
reformed
impelled
by
a
love
of
their
profession
or
some
by
the
passion
to
emulate
the
more
fortunate
of
their
sex
in
the
finery
of
dress
a
passion
which
first
occasioned
their
fall
many
by
want
and
all
by
a
sense
that
they
are
outcasts
they
are
no
sooner
liberated
than
they
return
with
new
zeal
to
the
life
from
which
they
have
been
detained
only
by
force
severe
laws
compel
secrecy
they
can
do
no
more
when
prostitution
is
criminal
disease
if
known
to
others
is
a
practical
conviction
under
such
circumstances
the
contaminated
will
be
slow
to
confess
disease
and
so
subject
themselves
to
punishment
yet
their
passions
and
their
necessities
alike
forbid
even
temporary
abstinence
they
spread
disease
without
limit
under
this
fact
lies
an
important
thought
were
it
no
more
disgraceful
to
contract
syphilis
than
it
is
to
have
fever
and
ague
the
diseased
would
seek
early
relief
which
is
nearly
equivalent
to
certain
relief
and
the
disorder
would
soon
be
confined
to
the
pitiable
few
who
have
lost
in
drunkenness
and
misery
the
instinctive
dread
of
all
that
is
foul
and
disgusting
in
personal
disease
prostitution
it
is
true
would
then
be
restored
to
its
old
roman
dignity
yet
disease
could
then
be
reached
and
all
but
but
a
respectable
syphilis
does
not
belong
to
our
age
and
nation
it
lost
caste
in
the
beginning
and
its
exploits
in
modern
times
have
not
been
of
a
character
to
win
it
friends
the
supposition
aims
only
to
show
by
contrast
the
evils
of
but
probably
injudicious
legislation
regarding
pains
and
penalties
if
the
whip
confiscation
and
banishment
in
the
hands
of
charlemagne
and
louis
aided
by
a
right
good
will
and
all
the
powers
of
a
military
despotism
could
not
suppress
prostitution
or
even
prevent
the
opening
of
houses
of
prostitution
if
penal
laws
in
europe
from
the
days
of
these
earnest
princes
until
now
have
utterly
failed
of
their
object
as
they
notoriously
have
it
is
fair
to
ask
how
much
more
can
prohibitory
laws
accomplish
in
a
country
where
the
right
of
private
judgment
and
personal
liberty
in
speech
and
action
are
the
very
foundation
of
the
body
politic
they
have
hitherto
been
ineffectual
in
spite
of
such
laws
the
vice
is
increasing
consequence
of
such
laws
its
most
enormous
physical
evil
is
extending
its
baleful
influence
through
every
rank
and
circle
of
it
is
still
emphatically
the
plague
of
the
poor
it
still
brings
sorrow
and
misery
to
the
firesides
of
the
affluent
and
titled
a
utopian
view
of
the
perfectibility
of
man
might
look
for
the
remedy
to
this
evil
in
universal
early
marriages
in
domestic
happiness
and
in
a
universal
moral
sense
which
will
compel
men
and
women
to
keep
their
marriage
vows
but
taking
man
as
he
is
we
find
the
tides
of
society
set
with
constantly
increasing
strength
against
early
marriages
that
domestic
happiness
is
not
synonymous
with
marriage
whether
early
or
late
and
that
the
moral
sense
which
should
teach
all
men
to
observe
even
their
solemn
promises
would
be
miraculous
for
these
things
the
law
has
done
all
that
has
been
thought
wise
to
attempt
probably
all
that
it
can
do
but
it
may
be
asked
if
government
has
the
power
to
relieve
society
of
the
vice
of
drunkenness
why
despair
of
its
power
regarding
prostitution
in
reply
it
may
be
asked
if
the
drunkard
himself
is
ever
cured
of
his
vicious
appetite
by
penalties
the
statute
despairs
of
this
it
even
recognizes
its
inability
to
prevent
the
sale
of
intoxicating
drinks
while
they
exist
it
therefore
claims
the
right
to
seize
and
destroy
them
can
it
seize
on
and
destroy
the
inborn
passion
which
fills
and
supports
houses
of
prostitution
then
it
can
not
do
for
the
one
what
it
hopes
to
do
for
the
other
again
the
suppression
of
slavery
and
the
have
been
cited
in
this
connection
as
illustrating
the
power
of
law
in
trespass
theft
violence
or
fraud
some
one
is
wronged
and
those
who
have
been
injured
seek
to
bring
the
offender
to
justice
here
there
is
no
aggrieved
person
all
who
are
in
interest
are
so
in
interest
that
they
deprecate
the
interference
of
all
law
except
what
they
claim
to
believe
is
the
law
of
nature
but
is
there
no
hope
in
the
societies
of
moral
reform
for
the
suppression
or
even
checking
of
the
general
vice
none
whatever
the
association
in
new
york
deserves
much
praise
for
its
zealous
benevolence
they
have
brought
back
some
of
these
erring
women
to
the
paths
of
virtue
but
they
have
done
no
more
to
stop
the
current
of
prostitution
than
he
could
do
to
dry
up
the
current
of
the
hudson
who
dips
water
with
a
bucket
in
truth
it
may
be
said
that
the
paths
of
virtue
have
been
found
to
be
slippery
places
for
some
that
would
be
thought
converts
wisdom
ways
have
been
found
too
peaceful
for
these
daughters
of
excitement
this
is
said
in
no
spirit
of
disparagement
to
the
efforts
of
the
society
they
may
well
be
proud
of
what
they
have
done
but
it
is
said
to
show
how
little
the
kindest
and
the
best
can
do
to
reclaim
those
who
have
once
fallen
from
virtue
and
honor
let
the
great
fact
then
be
well
understood
that
prohibitory
measures
have
always
failed
and
from
the
nature
of
the
case
must
forever
fail
to
suppress
prostitution
let
this
additional
fact
illustrated
in
the
foregoing
remark
be
well
considered
that
penalties
do
not
reform
the
offender
but
that
they
enforce
secrecy
in
the
offense
and
silence
regarding
its
consequences
which
is
a
chief
cause
of
the
present
wide
diffusion
of
the
venereal
poison
what
then
is
the
proper
province
of
legislation
in
this
important
matter
the
wise
lawgiver
does
not
attempt
impossibilities
he
knows
that
laws
which
experience
has
demonstrated
can
not
be
enforced
teach
disrespect
and
disobedience
to
all
law
he
knows
that
human
passions
can
not
be
changed
by
human
legislation
he
knows
that
if
he
attempt
the
impossible
greater
in
the
control
of
vice
he
is
certain
to
neglect
the
possible
and
important
less
he
knows
that
the
river
will
not
cease
to
flow
at
his
command
if
it
overflows
and
desolates
he
raises
its
banks
and
dikes
in
the
flood
to
prevent
a
general
inundation
for
hundreds
of
years
the
governments
of
europe
have
tried
in
vain
to
dry
up
the
sources
of
prostitution
with
the
opening
of
the
present
century
they
began
to
dike
in
the
river
and
prevent
avoidable
mischief
for
a
long
time
we
too
have
had
laws
against
prostitution
which
with
every
proper
effort
on
the
part
of
those
in
authority
have
proved
as
useless
as
those
who
live
by
this
illicit
traffic
could
desire
as
mischievous
in
spreading
disease
as
the
quack
advertiser
could
wish
is
it
not
time
then
to
inquire
whether
we
have
not
attempted
too
much
whether
if
we
attempt
less
we
shall
not
accomplish
more
may
we
not
be
able
to
limit
and
control
what
we
have
not
the
power
to
prevent
if
we
can
not
do
all
that
a
large
benevolence
might
wish
to
accomplish
in
the
name
of
humanity
is
it
not
our
duty
to
do
what
is
useful
and
practicable
all
that
is
possible
while
the
medical
board
are
persuaded
that
by
a
change
of
policy
such
as
is
suggested
by
the
facts
and
reasons
herewith
submitted
much
can
be
done
to
limit
and
control
prostitution
and
much
more
toward
the
eradication
of
venereal
diseases
they
are
not
yet
prepared
to
offer
the
details
of
a
plan
by
which
they
hope
these
important
ends
can
be
attained
with
the
assistance
of
the
board

are
now
in
correspondence
with
the
medical
officers
of
many
of
the
larger
cities
of
europe
where
restrictive
measures
have
replaced
prohibitory
when
they
have
obtained
the
information
which
they
hope
this
correspondence
will
furnish

november
dear

from
repeated
conversations
with
you
i
am
led
to
believe
that
many
diseases
incidental
to
the
children
on
randall

may
properly
be

to
parents
who
are
affected
with
constitutional

please
give
me
your
views
as
to
the
following
questions
as
early
as
december
among
the
children
under
your
care
to
what
extent
does
inherited
syphilis
exist
under
what
form
does
constitutional
syphilis
present
itself
and
what
diseases
are
attributable
to
its
taint
are
not
the

of

isaac

president
of
the
board
of

of
the
dear
sir
in
regard
to
the
interrogatories
contained
in
your
note
of
a
recent
date
on
the
subject
of
hereditary
syphilis
i
have
the
honor
to
reply
regarding
its
prevalence
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
nine
tenths
of
all
diseases
treated
in
this
hospital
during
the
past
five
years
have
been
of
constitutional
origin
and
for
the
most
part
hereditary
these
diseases
assume
a
variety
of
forms
and
involve
nearly
every
structure
of
the
body
terminating
in
cachexia
marasmus
phagedæna
etc
the
exact
proportion
which
hereditary
syphilis
bears
to
this
sum
of
constitutional
depravity
can
not
be
stated
with
accuracy
for
the
following
reasons
children
are
admitted
to
this
institution
between
two
and
fifteen
years
of
age
thus
throwing
out
of
the
category
infantile
syphilis
in
all
its
forms
and
except
in
few
cases
showing
none
of
its
specific
characteristics
having
been
modified
by
appropriate
treatment
but
manifests
itself
by
general
constitutional
depravity
and
determines
a
great
variety
of
diseases
embracing
nearly
every
form
of
skin
disease
affection
of
the
mucous
membranes
and
their
dependencies
diseases
of
the
eye
and
ear
of
the
bones
especially
of
joints
proving
the
prolific
and
lamentable
source
of
many
of
the
diseases
incident
to
children
of
the
class
presented
in
this
institution
making
then
due
allowance
for
its
masked
form
in
which
the
consequences
of
inherited
syphilis
appear
in
this
institution
together
with
the
absence
of
the
previous
history
both
of
patients
and
parents
it
is
believed
an
approximate
estimate
may
be
made
of
the
part
which
this
malady
bears
to
the
sum
of
constitutional
disease
from
the
foregoing
facts
and
from
careful
observation
during
the
past
few
years
in
this
branch
of
the
department
it
appears
that
human
degradation
is
the
source
of
the
stream
of
pollution
supplying
this
hospital
with
disease
and
farther
that
of
all
the
vices
which
make
up
the
sum
total
of
depravity
both
moral
and
physical
prostitution
and
its
consequences
furnish
the
larger
proportion
here
we
have
the
sad
picture
presented
of
a
large
number
of
children
doomed
to
an
early
grave
or
to
breathe
out
their
miserable
existence
bearing
a
loathsome
disease
carrying
the
penalties
of
vice
of
which
they
themselves
are
innocent
being
a
generation
contaminated
and
capable
only
of
contaminating
in
turn
in
the
above
sketch
i
have
confined
my
statement
to
syphilis
as
manifested
in
the
nursery
hospital
where
the
average
number
of
cases
of
disease
treated
is
about
two
thousand
from
this
field
is
excluded
every
variety
of
the
disease
except
the
one
constitutional
syphilis
affecting
children
after
having
been
modified
by
treatment
in
the
infant
whittelsey
it
has
been
stated
already
that
the
information
obtained
in
the
course
of
this
investigation
is
to
a
very
great
degree
undoubtedly
reliable
but
a
few
words
more
in
reference
to
the
same
subject
will
not
be
out
of
place
if
we
consider
the
importance
such
information
assumes
when
it
is
made
the
basis
of
serious
deduction
these
women
were
examined
singly
and
alone
and
a
person
who
has
been
engaged
for
a
number
of
years
in
any
particular
inquiry
is
able
by
his
experience
to
judge
whether
his
informants
are
speaking
the
truth
in
their
replies
for
this
among
other
reasons
we
are
satisfied
that
in
almost
every
case
there
was
no
deception
practiced
but
that
the
answers
obtained
were
true
in
all
essential
points
another
evidence
of
correctness
is
the
degree
of
congruity
that
characterized
the
greater
part
of
the
replies
farther
than
this
a
reference
to
the
questions
themselves
as
reprinted
in
chapter
xxxii
will
show
that
they
were
so
arranged
that
falsehoods
would
be
easily
detected
unless
very
carefully
contrived
before
the
time
of
examination
of
which
those
examined
had
no
notice
and
consequently
no
opportunity
for
fraud
or
deception
could
possibly
exist
it
is
not
denied
that
there
were
many
difficulties
to
be
encountered
although
the
mode
of
operation
was
simple
it
may
be
briefly
described
as
follows
the
captain
of
each
police
district
and
oftentimes
the
writer
with
him
explained
his
object
to
the
keeper
of
the
house
assuring
her
that
there
was
no
intention
to
annoy
harass
or
expose
her
and
particularly
that
no
prosecutions
should
be
based
upon
any
information
thus
collected
this
latter
promise
was
supported
by
a
letter
from
a
high
legal
functionary
addressed
to
the
mayor
and
police
department
assuring
them
that
the
particulars
they
collected
should
not
be
used
in
any
manner
prejudicial
to
the
women
themselves
as
it
was
believed
that
a
collection
of
the
necessary
information
required
by
such
a
work
as
the
present
would
be
productive
of
good
to
the
city
when
satisfied
upon
the
subject
of
prosecution
they
were
told
that
the
real
motive
was
to
obtain
correct
particulars
of
prostitution
without
exposing
individual
cases
so
as
to
enable
the
public
to
judge
of
its
extent
and
assist
them
in
forming
an
opinion
as
to
the
necessity
of
arrangements
which
would
ultimately
become
protective
to
our
citizens
at
large
as
well
as
to
housekeepers
and
courtesans
and
many
of
the
housekeepers
expressed
a
hope
that
the
design
might
be
accomplished
their
interests
therefore
led
them
to
speak
the
truth
in
short
from
the
precautions
taken
and
from
the
result
itself
very
little
doubt
can
be
entertained
as
to
the
authenticity
of
the
principal
part
of
the
replies
on
all
essential
points
and
upon
this
consideration
these
replies
have
been
made
the
basis
of
the
description
and
remarks
upon
prostitution
in
new
york
the
task
is
completed
and
the
reader
attention
may
be
invited
to
the
various
facts
substantiated
as
embodied
in
the
following
recapitulation
there
are
six
thousand
public
prostitutes
in
new
york
the
majority
of
these
are
from
fifteen
to
years
old
three
eighths
of
them
were
born
in
the
united
states
many
of
those
born
abroad
came
here
poor
to
improve
their
condition
is
at
a
very
low
standard
with
one
fifth
of
them
are
married
women
one
half
of
them
have
given
birth
to
children
and
more
than
one
half
of
these
children
are
illegitimate
the
ratio
of
mortality
among
children
of
prostitutes
is
four
times
greater
than
the
ordinary
ratio
among
children
in
new
york
many
of
these
children
are
living
in
the
abodes
of
vice
and
obscenity
the
majority
of
these
women
have
been
prostitutes
for
less
than
four
years
the
average
duration
of
a
prostitute
life
is
only
four
years
nearly
one
half
of
the
prostitutes
in
new
york
admit
that
they
are
or
have
been
sufferers
from
syphilis
seduction
destitution
ill
treatment
by
parents
husbands
or
relatives
intemperance
and
bad
company
are
the
main
causes
of
prostitution
women
in
this
city
have
not
sufficient
means
of
employment
their
employment
is
inadequately
remunerated
the
associations
of
many
employments
are
prejudicial
to
morality
six
sevenths
of
the
prostitutes
drink
intoxicating
liquors
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
parental
influences
induced
habits
of
intoxication
a
professed
respect
for
religion
is
common
among
them
a
capital
of
nearly
millions
of
is
invested
in
the
business
of
prostitution
the
annual
expenditure
on
account
of
prostitution
is
more
than
millions
of
prohibitory
measures
have
signally
failed
to
suppress
or
check
prostitution
a
necessity
exists
for
some
action

footnotes
since
this
introduction
was
written
some
changes
have
taken
place
in
the
constitution
of
the
board
of
governors
the
election
of
tiemann
to
the
mayoralty
caused
a
vacancy
which
is
now
filled
by
mcelroy
and
the
resignation
and
subsequent
death
of
taylor
has
resulted
in
the
election
of
william
pinkney
esq
now
president
of
the
board
now
secretary
of
the
board
to
explain
the
apparent
solecism
of
addressing
a
letter
to
president
townsend
detailing
actions
in
which
he
had
taken
so
important
a
part
it
may
be
necessary
to
say
that
a
standing
order
of
the
board
of
governors
requires
all
official
correspondence
with
them
to
be
addressed
to
their
president
see
chapter
xxxii
for
these
questions
it
is
quite
probable
that
the
commercial
and
financial
panic
which
commenced
about
the
time
these
pages
were
nearly
ready
for
the
press
and
continued
throughout
the
winter
of
has
added
to
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
new
york
city
very
likely
as
many
as
five
hundred
or
perhaps
a
thousand
but
certainly
not
to
the
extent
generally
imagined
allusions
have
been
made
elsewhere
to
the
exaggerated
estimates
of
the
extent
of
this
vice
and
the
opinions
publicly
expressed
in
regard
to
accessions
to
the
ranks
of
prostitutes
during
the
last
few
months
generally
seem
to
be
of
a
similarly

this
calculation
is
not
very
explicitly
stated
it
is
intended
to
show
that
syphilis
is
not
dangerously
prevalent
among
the
general
population
the
police
arrive
at
this
conclusion
by
deducting
the
cases
treated
in
the
charité
which
they
estimate
at
two
thirds
from
the

population

then
divide
the

prove

that
after
his
death
a
large
number
of
prurient
french
prints
which
were
in
the
of
london
and
designed
for
the
private
amusement
of
the
king
were
burned
the
story
of
the
prints
and
their
deflagration
may
be
true
but
it
is
very
questionable
if
they
were
for
royal
use
a
number
of
low

the
ineffectual
provisions
of
the
law
have
recently
engaged
the
attention
of
the
inhabitants
of
london
and
a
meeting
was
held
in
january
of
the
present
year
to
consider
the
evil
and
decide
what
steps
should
be
taken
in
the
premises
we
shall
notice
in
another
part
of
this
work
some
of
the
suggestions
made
on
that
occasion
general
secondary
questions
do
not
come
within
the
scope
of
this
work
but
the
labors
of
these
dwelling
improvement
associations
are
intimately
connected
with
the
subject
we
have
now
under
investigation
in
london
model
for
single
men
single
women
and
married
couples
with
their
children
have
been
tried
and
found
eminently
successful
both
as
a
moderate
investment
and
as
a
very
admirable
arrangement
for
promoting
the
comfort
and
health
of
the
working
classes
the
details
given
some
two
years
ago
through
the
daily
papers
on
the
lodgings
of
the
poor
and
the
very
poor
of
new
york
were
frightful
enough
to
excite
the
active
sympathy
of
the
benevolent
capitalists
of
this
great
city
the
very
best
philanthropy
is
that
which
teaches
and
enables
the
poor
man
to
benefit
his
own
condition
this
principle
is
practically
in
operation
all
over
the
united
states
but
in
great
cities
the
freedom
of
action
and
the
directly
beneficial
results
of
frugality
and
industry
are
not
so
immediate
as
in
country
places
the
attempt
by
the
poor
to
improve
their
own
dwellings
in
these
large
cities
is
almost
hopeless
because
it
does
not
depend
upon
individual
exertions
but
on
combination
both
of
money
and
knowledge
the
how
when
and
where
have
to
be
found
out
and
carried
through
very
small
difficulties
these
and
easily
overcome
if
those
who
have
the
requisite
means
to
carry
out
such
a
reform
and
thus
lend
their
aid
to
the
solution
of
an
important
social
problem
have
an
inclination
commensurate
with
their
resources

other

we
recollect
rightly
edinburgh
is
a

town
in
factory

moreover
we
should
always
expect
to
find
a
very
large
amount
of
immorality
which
would
somewhat
displace
open
and
avowed
prostitution
for
hire

sydney

a
great

was
thought
to
have
been
accomplished
in
one
particular
branch
of
female

and
business
when
the
leading
employers
had
been
induced
to
promise
that
the

to

it
would
be
interesting
to
know
whether
this
illicit
intercourse
is
by
way
of
cohabitation
or
merely
temporary
instances
are
not
rare
of
people
cohabiting
who
allege
themselves
too
poor
to
pay
the
marriage
fees
in
order
to
obviate
this
it
is
customary
for
ministers
in
poor
and
populous
parishes
in
england
where
the
circumstances
of
individual
parishioners
are
not
known
to
them
to
invite
all
parties
who
are
living
in
concubinage
to
come
and
be
married
free
of
expense
many
avail
themselves
of
this
offer
while
this
work
was
passing
through
the
press
we
met
with
a
recent
publication
by
wm
acton
of
london
entitled
prostitution
considered
in
its
moral
social
and
sanitary
aspects
which
gives
later
information
on
this
point
the
metropolitan
police
estimated
the
number
of
prostitutes
in
london
in
and
again
in
with
the
following
results
prostitutes
in
brothels
prostitutes
walking
the
streets
infesting
low
neighborhoods
total
acton
says
the
return
gives
after
all
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
grand
total
of
prostitution
were
there
any
possibility
of
reckoning
all
those
in
london
who
would
come
within
the
definition
of
prostitutes
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
estimates
of
the
boldest
who
have
preceded
me
would
be
thrown
into
the
p
an
estimate
of
cork
was
made
in
for
the
which
gave
two
hundred
and
fifty
prostitutes
living
in
eighty
brothels
besides
one
hundred
clandestine
prostitutes
their
ages
were
stated
as
between
sixteen
and
twenty
years
this
may
be
deemed
a
foregone
conclusion
but
it
was
based
upon
previous
inquiries
in
individual
cases
we
do
not
understand
this
figure
the
sum
of
the
sewing
trades
of
london
is
nearly
twenty
times
this
number
perhaps
mayhew
refers
only
to
including
the
very
commonest
garments
both
woolen
and
cotton
or
even
to
that
portion
of
the
trade
that
have
their
principal
abode
in
the
particular
localities
visited
the
reader
will
notice
that
neither
ryan
tait
nor
the
views
as
to
the
duration
of
life
expressed
in
the
portion
of
this
work
devoted
to
new
york
agree
with
those
german
authors
who
have
asserted
the
healthfulness
of
prostitution
see
chapter
hamburg
at
the
meeting
in
london
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
acton
late
surgeon
to
the
islington
dispensary
and
fellow
of
the
royal
medical
society
said
that
in
his
opinion
the
subject
under
discussion
was
one
worth
legislating
for
as
a
surgeon
he
had
investigated
the
subject
not
only
in
london
but
in
paris
and
other
continental
capitals
and
he
could
speak
with
some
authority
as
to
the
statistics
of
prostitution
and
the
manner
in
which
the
women
became
as
it
were
absorbed
in
the
population
by
whom
they
were
surrounded
calculations
based
upon
the
census
tables
it
had
come
out
that
of
all
the
unmarried
women
of
full
age
in
the
country
one
in
every
or
were
this
might
appear
a
startling
announcement
but
the
calculation
had
been
made
upon
returns
the
truth
of
which
had
not
been
questioned
it
was
a
popular
error
to
suppose
that
these
women
died
young
and
made
their
exits
from
life
in
hospitals
and
the
fact
was
not
so
women
of
that
class
were
all
picked
lives
and
dissipation
did
not
usually
kill
them
they
led
a
life
of
prostitution
for
two
three
or
four
years
and
then
either
married
or
got
into
some
service
or
employment
and
gradually
became
amalgamated
with
society
it
was
estimated
that
in
this
manner
about
per
cent
of
the
whole
number
amalgamated
each
year
with
the
population
from
these
remarks
we
may
deduce
the
same
continuance
of
a
life
of
prostitution
as
given
in
the
text
namely
an
average
of
four
years
but
they
advance
another
theory
as
to
its
termination
substituting
reformation
for
death
we
should
be
slow
to
give
an
unqualified
endorsement
to
this
opinion
that
cases
of
reformation
do
take
place
and
probably
to
a
greater
extent
than
is
generally
imagined
can
not
be
denied
but
that
one
fourth
of
the
total
number
of
prostitutes
abandon
their
sinful
life
every
year
and
become
virtuous
members
of
society
is
a
conclusion
that
american
experience
will
not
support
in
england
and
on
the
european
continent
there
may
be
a
class
of
men
in
the
lower
ranks
of
life
who
do
not
regard
virtue
as
a
qua
in
the
choice
of
a
wife
indeed
the
notorious
facility
with
which
the
mistresses
of
noblemen
or
gentlemen
can
be
married
to
a
dependent
sufficiently
proves
this
but
in
this
country
public
opinion
sets
strongly
in
the
opposite
direction
here
if
a
woman
once
errs
or
is
even
suspected
of
error
she
is
rigorously
excluded
from
virtuous
society
and
although
her
subsequent
life
may
be
irreproachable
the
lapse
is
seldom
forgiven
the
old
roman
law
once
a
prostitute
always
a
prostitute
is
too
sternly
enforced
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
acton
speech
is
the
first
intimation
we
have
met
of
so
very
liberal
a
benevolence
in
england
we
have
calculated
that
there
are
upward
of
six
hundred
thousand
women
in
london
between
fifteen
and
years
old
the
proportion
of
married
women
among
these
would
be
and
upward
unmarried
women
over
twenty
years
and
widows
about
a
very
singular
fact
in
connection
with
the
census
is
that
there
is
not
a
single
individual
returned
as
a
prostitute
this
is
not
that
the
authorities
do
not
take
cognizance
of
crime
for
there
are
female
prisoners
in
great
britain
all
of
whom
however
except
are
returned
as
having
some
legal
occupation
there
are

were
piled
with
myriads
of

carcasses
in

where
i
passed
the
last
day
of
these
festivities
grave
men
and
sedate
children
were
from
morning
till
midnight
hanging
strings
of
these
noisy
things
from
their
balconies
and
perpetually
renewing
them
as
they
exploded
the
women
in
their
rich
handsome
dresses
were
screeching
their
shrill
songs
and
twanging
their
lutes
on
every
veranda
in
the
chinese
quarter
while
the
lords
of
creation
assembled
at
a
round
table
were
cramming
the
repast
the
women
hired
singing
women
of
not
doubtful
reputation
in
the
intervals
of
their
music
take
their
seats
at
the
table
opposite
the
men
they
do
not
eat
but
their
business
being
to
promote
the
conviviality
of
the
feast
they
challenge
the
men
to
the
samshu
cup
and
drink
with
them
it
is
astonishing
to
see
what
a
quantity
of
diluted
samshu
these
painted
and
brocaded
can
drink
without
any
apparent
effect

excellent
but
it
lasted

i
loathed

i
believe
the
chinese
spend
fabulous
sums
in
these
entertainments
the
women
are
often
brought
from
distances
and
are
certainly
chosen
with
some
discrimination
they
are
an
imitation
of
the
chinese
lady
and
as
the
chinese
lady
has
no
education
and
no
duties
the
difference
between
the
poor
girl
and
the
poor
abject
wife
is
probably
not
observable
in
appearance
or
manner
the
dress
is
particularly
modest
and
becoming
they
all
have
great
quantities
of
black
hair
if
they
would
let
it
fall
disheveled
down
their
backs
as
the
manilla
women
do
they
would
be
more
picturesque
but
not
formal
and
decent
as
china
is
even
in
its
wantonness
the
chinawoman
hair
is
gummed
and
built
up
into
a
structure
rather
resembling
a
huge
and
the
edifice
is
adorned
with
combs
and
jewels
and
flowers
arranged
with
a
certain
taste
