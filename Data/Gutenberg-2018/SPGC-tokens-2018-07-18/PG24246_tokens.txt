mr

no

whatever

albert

as
i
am
albert
weener
one
weener
i
always
knew
i
should
write
a
book
something
to
help
tired
minds
lay
aside
the
cares
of
the
day
but
i
always
say
you
never
can
tell
what
around
the
corner
till
you
turn
it
and
everyone
has
become
so
accustomed
to
fantastic
occurrences
in
the
last
twenty
one
years
that
the
inspiring
and
relaxing
novel
i
used
to
dream
about
would
be
today
as
unreal
as
atlantis
instead
i
find
i
must
write
of
the
things
which
have
happened
to
me
in
that
time
it
all
began
with
the
word
itself
grass
gramina
the
family
gramineae
grasses
oh
i
responded
doubtfully
the
picture
in
my
mind
was
only
of
a
vague
area
in
parks
edged
with
benches
for
the
idle
anyway
i
was
far
too
resentful
to
pay
strict
attention
i
had
set
out
in
good
faith
not
for
the
first
time
in
my
career
as
a
salesman
to
answer
an
ad
offering
or
more
daily
to
top
producers
naturally
expecting
the
searching
onceover
of
an
alert
salesmanager
back
to
the
light
behind
a
shinytopped
desk
when
youve
handled
as
many
products
as
i
had
an
ad
like
that
has
the
right
sound
but
the
world
is
full
of
crackpots
and
some
of
the
most
pernicious
are
those
who
hoodwink
unsuspecting
canvassers
into
anticipating
a
sizzling
deal
where
there
is
actually
only
a
warm
hope
no
genuinely
highclass
proposition
ever
came
from
a
layout
without
aggressiveness
enough
to
put
on
some
kind
of
front
working
out
of
an
office
for
instance
not
an
outdated
rundown
apartment
in
the
wrong
part
of
hollywood
it
only
a
temporary
drawback
weener
which
restricts
the
metamorphizer
efficacy
to
grasses
the
wheeling
syllables
coming
in
a
deep
voice
from
the
middleaged
woman
emphasized
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
business
the
snuffy
apartment
the
unhomelike
livingroom
dust
and
books
its
only
furniture
the
unbelievable
kitchen
looking
like
a
pictured
warning
to
housewives
were
only
guffaws
before
the
final
buffoonery
of
discovering
the
j
s
francis
who
inserted
that
promising
ad
to
be
josephine
spencer
francis
wrong
location
wrong
atmosphere
wrong
gender
now
i
not
the
sort
of
man
who
would
restrict
women
to
a
place
in
the
nursery
no
indeed
i
believe
they
are
in
some
ways
just
as
capable
as
i
am
if
miss
francis
had
been
one
of
those
wellgroomed
efficient
ladies
who
have
earned
their
place
in
the
business
world
without
at
the
same
time
sacrificing
femininity
i
sure
i
would
not
have
suffered
such
a
pang
for
my
lost
time
and
carfare
but
wellgroomed
and
feminine
were
alike
inapplicable
adjectives
towering
above
me
she
was
at
least
five
foot
ten
while
i
am
of
average
height
she
strode
up
and
down
the
kitchen
which
apparently
was
office
and
laboratory
also
waving
her
arms
speaking
too
exuberantly
the
antithesis
of
moderation
and
restraint
she
was
an
aggregate
of
cylinders
big
and
small
her
shapeless
legs
were
columns
with
large
flatheeled
shoes
for
their
bases
supporting
the
inverted
pediment
of
great
hips
her
too
short
greasespotted
skirt
was
a
mighty
barrel
and
on
it
was
placed
the
tremendous
drum
of
her
torso
a
little
more
work
she
rumbled
a
few
interesting
problems
solved
and
the
metamorphizer
will
change
the
basic
structure
of
any
plant
inoculated
with
it
large
as
she
was
her
face
and
head
were
disproportionately
big
her
eyes
i
can
only
speak
of
as
enormous
i
dare
say
there
are
some
who
would
have
called
them
beautiful
in
moments
of
intensity
they
bored
into
mine
and
held
them
till
i
felt
quite
uncomfortable
think
of
what
this
discovery
means
she
urged
me
think
of
it
weener
plants
will
be
capable
of
making
use
of
anything
within
reach
understand
weener
anything
rocks
quartz
decomposed
granite
anything
she
took
a
gold
victorian
toothpick
from
the
pocket
of
her
mannish
jacket
and
used
it
energetically
i
shuddered
unfortunately
she
went
on
a
little
indistinctly
unfortunately
i
lack
resources
for
further
experiment
right
now
this
too
i
thought
despairingly
a
slight
cash
investment
just
enough
to
get
production
started
how
many
wishful
times
ive
heard
it
i
was
a
salesman
not
a
sucker
and
anyway
i
was
for
the
moment
without
liquid
capital
it
will
change
the
face
of
the
world
weener
no
more
usedup
areas
no
more
frantic
scrabbling
for
the
few
bits
of
naturally
rich
ground
no
more
struggle
to
get
artificial
fertilizers
to
wornout
soil
in
the
face
of
ignorance
and
poverty
she
thrust
out
a
hand
surprisingly
finely
and
economically
molded
barely
missing
a
piledup
heap
of
dishes
crowned
by
a
flowerpot
trailing
droopy
tendrils
excitedly
she
paced
the
floor
largely
taken
up
by
jars
and
flats
of
vegetation
some
green
and
flourishing
others
gray
and
sickly
all
constricting
her
movements
as
did
the
stove
supporting
a
glass
tank
robbed
of
the
goldfish
which
should
rightfully
have
gaped
against
its
sides
and
containing
instead
some
slimy
growth
topped
by
a
bubbling
brown
scum
i
simply
couldnt
understand
how
any
woman
could
so
far
oppose
what
must
have
been
her
natural
instinct
as
to
live
and
work
in
such
a
slatternly
place
it
wasnt
just
her
kitchen
which
was
disordered
and
dirty
her
person
too
was
slovenly
and
possibly
unclean
the
lank
gray
hair
swishing
about
her
ears
was
dark
perhaps
from
vigor
but
more
likely
from
frugality
with
soap
and
water
her
massive
heavychinned
face
was
untouched
by
makeup
and
suggested
an
equal
innocence
of
other
attentions
fertilizers
poo
expedients
weener
miserable
makeshift
expedients
her
unavoidable
eyes
bit
into
mine
what
is
a
fertilizer
a
tidbit
a
pap
a
lollypop
indians
use
fish
chinese
nightsoil
agricultural
chemists
concoct
tasty
tonics
of
nitrogen
and
potash
where
your
progress
putting
a
mechanical
whip
on
a
buggy
instead
of
inventing
an
internal
combustion
engine
ive
gone
directly
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
like
watt
like
maxwell
like
almroth
wright
no
use
being
held
back
because
youve
only
poor
materials
to
work
with
leap
ahead
with
imagination
change
the
plant
itself
weener
change
the
plant
itself
it
was
no
longer
politeness
which
held
me
if
i
could
have
freed
myself
from
her
eyes
i
would
have
escaped
thankfully
nourish
on
anything
she
shouted
rubbing
the
round
end
of
the
toothpick
vigorously
into
her
ear
sow
a
barren
waste
a
worthless
slagheap
with
lifegiving
corn
or
wheat
inoculate
the
plants
with
the
metamorphizer
and
you
have
a
crop
fatter
than
iowa
or
the
best
the
whole
world
will
teem
with
abundance
perhaps
but
what
was
the
sales
angle
where
did
i
come
in
i
didnt
know
a
dandelion
from
a
toadstool
and
was
quite
content
to
keep
my
distance
from
nature
had
she
inserted
the
ad
merely
to
lure
a
listener
her
whole
procedure
was
irregular
not
a
word
about
territories
and
commissions
if
i
could
bring
her
to
the
point
of
mentioning
the
necessary
investment
maybe
i
could
get
away
gracefully
you
said
you
were
stuck
i
prompted
resolved
to
get
the
painful
interview
over
with
stuck
stuck
oh
money
to
perfect
the
metamorphizer
luckily
it
will
do
it
itself
i
do
catch
look
about
you
what
do
you
see
i
glanced
around
and
started
to
say
a
measuring
glass
on
a
dirty
plate
next
to
half
a
cold
fried
egg
but
she
stopped
me
with
a
sweep
of
her
arm
which
came
dangerously
close
to
the
flasks
and
retorts
all
holding
dirtycolored
liquids
which
cluttered
the
sink
no
no
i
mean
outside
i
couldnt
see
outside
because
instead
of
a
window
i
was
facing
a
sickly
leaf
unaccountably
preserved
in
a
jar
of
alcohol
i
said
nothing
metaphorically
of
course
wheatfields
acres
and
acres
of
wheat
bread
wheat
a
grass
and
cornfields
iowa
wisconsin
illinois
not
a
state
in
the
union
without
corn
milo
oats
sorghum
rye
all
grasses
and
the
metamorphizer
will
work
on
all
of
them
i
always
a
man
with
an
open
mind
she
might
it
was
just
possible
she
might
have
something
afterall
but
could
i
work
with
her
go
out
in
the
sticks
and
talk
to
farmers
learn
to
sit
on
fence
rails
and
whittle
asking
after
crops
as
if
they
were
of
interest
to
me
no
no
it
was
fantastic
out
of
the
question
a
different
more
practical
setup
now
at
least
there
would
have
been
no
lack
of
prospects
if
you
wanted
to
go
miles
from
civilization
to
find
them
no
answers
like
we
never
read
magazines
thank
you
of
course
it
was
hardly
believable
a
woman
without
interest
in
keeping
herself
presentable
could
invent
any
such
fabulous
product
but
there
was
a
bare
chance
of
making
a
few
sales
just
on
the
idea
the
idea
it
suddenly
struck
me
she
had
the
whole
thing
backwards
grasses
she
said
and
went
on
about
wheat
and
corn
and
going
out
to
the
rubes
southern
california
was
dotted
with
lawns
wasnt
it
why
rush
around
to
the
hinterland
when
there
was
a
big
territory
next
door
and
undoubtedly
a
better
one
revive
your
old
tired
lawn
i
improvised
no
manures
fuss
cuss
or
muss
one
shot
of
the
meta
one
shot
of
francis
amazing
discovery
and
your
lawn
springs
to
new
life
lawns
nonsense
she
snorted
rudely
i
thought
do
you
think
ive
spent
years
in
order
to
satisfy
suburban
vanity
lawns
indeed
lawns
indeed
miss
francis
i
retorted
with
some
spirit
i
a
salesman
and
i
know
something
about
marketing
a
product
yours
should
be
sold
to
householders
for
their
lawns
should
it
well
i
say
it
shouldnt
listen
to
me
there
are
two
ways
of
making
a
discovery
one
is
to
cut
off
a
cat
hindleg
the
discovery
is
then
made
that
a
cat
with
one
leg
cut
off
has
three
legs
hah
the
other
way
is
to
find
out
your
need
and
then
search
for
a
method
of
filling
it
my
work
is
with
plants
i
do
take
a
daisy
and
see
if
i
can
make
it
produce
a
red
and
black
petaled
monstrosity
if
i
did
i
be
a
fashionable
horticulturist
delighted
to
encourage
imbeciles
to
grow
grass
in
a
desert
my
method
is
the
second
one
i
want
no
more
backward
countries
no
more
famines
in
india
or
china
no
more
dustbowls
no
more
wars
depressions
hungry
children
for
this
i
produced
the
metamorphizer
to
make
not
two
blades
of
grass
grow
where
one
sprouted
before
but
whole
fields
flourish
where
only
rocks
and
sandpiles
lay
no
weener
it
wo
do
i
ca
trade
in
my
vision
as
a
downpayment
on
a
means
to
encourage
a
waste
of
ground
seed
and
water
you
may
think
i
lost
such
rights
when
i
thought
up
the
name
metamorphizer
to
appeal
on
the
popular
level
but
there
a
difference
that
was
a
clincher
anyone
who
believed
metamorphizer
had
salesappeal
just
wasnt
all
there
but
why
should
i
disillusion
her
and
wound
her
pride
down
underneath
her
rough
exterior
i
supposed
she
could
be
as
sensitive
as
i
and
i
hope
i
am
not
without
chivalry
i
said
nothing
but
of
course
her
interdiction
of
the
only
possibility
killed
any
weakening
inclination
and
yet
yet
afterall
i
had
to
have
all
right
weener
this
pump
she
produced
miraculously
from
the
jumble
an
unwieldy
engine
dragging
a
long
and
tangling
tail
of
hose
behind
it
the
end
lost
among
mementos
of
unfinished
meals
this
pump
is
full
of
the
metamorphizer
enough
to
inoculate
a
hundred
and
fifty
acres
when
added
in
proper
proportion
to
the
irrigating
water
i
have
a
table
worked
out
to
show
you
about
that
the
tank
holds
five
gallons
get
a
gallon
a
dollar
and
a
half
an
acre
and
keep
ten
percent
for
yourself
be
sure
to
return
the
pump
every
night
i
had
to
say
for
her
that
when
she
got
down
to
business
she
didnt
waste
any
words
perhaps
this
contrasting
directness
so
startled
me
i
was
roped
in
before
i
could
refuse
on
the
other
hand
of
course
i
would
be
helping
out
someone
who
needed
my
assistance
badly
since
she
couldnt
with
all
the
obvious
factors
against
her
be
having
a
very
easy
time
sometimes
it
is
advisable
to
temper
business
judgment
with
kindness
her
first
offer
was
ridiculous
in
its
assumption
that
a
talent
skill
and
effort
were
worth
only
a
miserable
ten
percent
as
though
i
were
a
literary
agent
with
something
a
cinch
to
sell
i
began
to
feel
more
at
home
as
we
ironed
out
the
details
and
i
brought
the
knowledge
acquired
with
much
hard
work
and
painful
experience
into
the
bargaining
fifty
percent
i
wanted
and
fifty
percent
i
finally
got
by
demanding
seventyfive
she
became
as
interested
in
the
contest
as
she
had
been
before
in
benefits
to
humanity
and
i
perceived
a
keen
mind
under
all
her
eccentricity
i
ca
truthfully
say
i
got
to
like
her
but
i
reconciled
myself
and
eventually
was
on
my
way
with
the
pump
a
trifling
weight
to
miss
francis
judging
by
the
way
she
handled
it
but
uncomfortably
heavy
to
me
strapped
to
my
back
and
ten
feet
of
recalcitrant
hose
coiled
round
my
shoulder
she
turned
her
imperious
eyes
on
me
again
and
repeated
for
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
the
instructions
for
applying
as
though
i
were
less
intelligent
than
she
i
went
out
through
the
barren
livingroom
and
took
a
backward
glance
at
the
scaling
stucco
walls
of
the
apartmenthouse
shaking
my
head
it
was
a
queer
place
for
albert
weener
the
crackerjack
salesman
who
had
once
led
his
team
in
a
national
contest
to
put
over
a
threepiece
aluminum
deal
to
be
working
out
of
and
for
a
woman
and
for
such
a
woman
everything
is
for
the
best
is
my
philosophy
and
make
your
cross
your
crutch
is
a
good
thought
to
hold
so
i
reminded
myself
that
it
takes
fewer
muscles
to
smile
than
to
frown
and
no
one
sees
the
bright
side
of
things
if
he
wears
dark
glasses
since
it
takes
all
kinds
to
make
a
world
and
josephine
spencer
francis
was
one
of
those
kinds
wasnt
it
only
reasonable
to
suppose
there
were
other
kinds
who
would
buy
the
stuff
she
invented
the
only
way
to
sell
something
is
first
to
sell
yourself
and
i
piously
went
over
the
virtues
of
the
metamorphizer
in
my
mind
what
if
by
its
very
nature
there
could
be
no
repeat
business
i
wasnt
tying
myself
to
it
for
life
all
that
remained
was
to
find
myself
a
customer
i
tried
to
recall
the
location
of
the
nearest
rural
territory
san
fernando
valley
probably
a
long
tiresome
trip
and
expensive
unless
i
wished
to
demean
myself
by
thumbing
rides
a
difficult
thing
to
do
burdened
as
i
was
by
the
pump
if
she
hadnt
balked
unreasonably
about
putting
the
stuff
on
lawns
i
have
prospects
right
at
hand
i
was
suddenly
lawnconscious
there
was
probably
not
a
los
angeles
street
i
hadnt
covered
at
some
time
magazines
vacuums
old
gold
nearnylons
and
i
must
have
been
aware
of
green
spaces
before
most
of
the
houses
but
now
for
the
first
time
i
saw
lawns
neat
sharply
confined
smoothshaven
lawns
sagging
slipping
but
lawns
ragged
weedy
dissolute
lawns
halfbare
repulsively
crippled
hummocky
lawns
bright
lawns
insistent
on
former
respectability
and
trimness
yellow
and
gray
lawns
touched
with
the
craziness
of
age
quite
beyond
all
interest
in
looks
content
to
doze
easily
in
the
sun
if
miss
mixture
was
on
the
upandup
and
she
hadnt
introduced
a
perfectly
unreasonable
condition
why
i
couldnt
miss
on
the
other
hand
i
thought
suddenly
i
the
salesman
not
she
it
was
up
to
me
as
a
practical
man
to
determine
where
and
how
i
could
sell
to
the
best
advantage
with
sudden
resolution
i
walked
over
a
twinkling
greensward
and
rang
the
bell
good
afternoon
madam
i
can
see
from
your
garden
youre
a
lady
interested
in
keeping
it
lovely
not
my
garden
and
mrs
smith
not
home
the
door
shut
not
gently
the
next
house
had
no
lawn
at
all
but
was
fronted
with
a
rank
growth
of
ivy
i
felt
no
one
had
a
right
to
plant
ivy
when
i
was
selling
something
effective
only
on
the
family
gramineae
i
tramped
over
the
ivy
hard
and
rang
the
doorbell
on
the
other
side
good
afternoon
madam
i
can
see
from
the
appearance
of
your
lawn
youre
a
lady
who
really
cares
for
her
garden
i
introducing
to
a
restricted
group
just
one
or
two
in
each
neighborhood
a
new
preparation
an
astounding
discovery
by
a
renowned
scientist
which
will
make
your
grass
twice
as
green
and
many
times
as
vigorous
upon
one
application
without
the
aid
of
anything
else
natural
or
artificial
my
gardener
takes
care
of
all
that
but
madam
there
is
a
city
ordinance
against
unlicensed
solicitors
have
you
a
license
young
man
after
the
fifth
refusal
i
began
to
think
less
unkindly
of
miss
idea
of
selling
the
stuff
to
farmers
and
to
wonder
what
was
wrong
with
my
technique
after
some
understandable
hesitation
for
i
do
make
a
practice
of
being
odd
or
conspicuous
i
sat
down
on
the
curb
to
think
besides
the
pump
was
getting
wearisomely
heavy
i
couldnt
decide
exactly
what
was
unsatisfactory
in
my
routine
the
stuff
had
neither
been
used
nor
advertised
so
there
could
be
no
prejudice
against
it
no
one
had
yet
allowed
me
to
get
so
far
as
quoting
price
so
it
wasnt
too
expensive
the
process
of
elimination
brought
me
to
the
absurd
conclusion
that
the
fault
must
lie
in
me
not
in
my
appearance
i
reasoned
for
i
was
a
personable
young
man
a
little
over
thirty
at
the
time
with
no
obvious
defects
a
few
visits
to
the
dentist
wouldnt
have
removed
of
course
i
do
have
an
unfortunate
skin
condition
but
such
a
thing
an
act
of
god
as
the
lawyers
say
and
people
must
take
me
as
i
am
no
it
wasnt
my
appearance
or
was
it
that
monstrously
outsized
pump
who
wanted
to
listen
to
a
salestalk
from
a
man
apparently
prepared
for
an
immediate
gasattack
there
is
little
use
in
pressing
your
trousers
between
two
boards
under
the
mattress
if
you
discount
such
neatness
with
the
accouterment
of
an
invading
martian
i
uncoiled
the
hose
from
my
shoulder
and
eased
the
incubus
from
my
back
leaving
them
visible
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
crossed
the
most
miserable
lawn
yet
encountered
it
was
composed
of
what
i
since
learned
is
bermuda
a
plant
most
southern
californians
call
with
many
profane
prefixes
devilgrass
it
was
yellow
the
dirty
grayish
yellow
of
moldy
straw
and
bald
scuffed
spots
immodestly
exposed
the
cracked
parched
earth
beneath
over
the
walk
interwoven
stolons
had
been
felted
down
into
a
ragged
mat
repellent
alike
to
foot
and
eye
perversely
onto
what
had
once
been
flowerbeds
the
runners
crept
erect
bristling
spines
showing
faintly
green
on
top
the
only
live
color
in
the
miserable
expanse
where
the
grass
had
gone
to
seed
there
were
patches
of
muddy
purple
patches
which
enhanced
rather
than
relieved
the
diseased
color
of
the
whole
and
emphasized
the
dying
air
of
the
yard
it
was
a
neglected
unvalued
thing
an
odious
appendage
a
mistake
never
rectified
madam
i
began
your
lawn
is
deplorable
there
was
no
use
giving
her
the
line
about
anyway
now
the
pump
was
off
my
back
i
felt
reckless
i
threw
the
whole
book
of
salesmanship
away
it
the
most
neglected
lawn
in
the
neighborhood
it
is
madam
i
sorry
to
say
no
less
than
a
disgrace
she
was
a
woman
beyond
the
age
of
childbearing
her
dress
revealing
the
outlines
of
her
corset
and
she
looked
at
me
coldly
through
rimless
glassing
biting
the
bridge
of
her
inadequate
nose
so
what
she
asked
madam
i
said
for
ten
dollars
i
can
make
this
the
finest
lawn
in
the
block
the
pride
of
your
family
and
the
envy
of
your
neighbors
i
can
do
better
things
with
ten
dollars
than
spend
it
on
a
bunch
of
dead
grass
gratefully
i
knew
i
had
her
then
and
was
glad
i
hadnt
weakly
given
in
to
an
impulse
to
carry
out
the
crackpot
original
instructions
when
they
start
to
argue
my
motto
is
theyre
sold
i
took
a
good
breath
and
wound
up
for
the
clincher
i
wo
say
she
was
an
easy
sale
but
afterall
i
a
psychologist
i
found
all
her
weak
points
and
touched
them
expertly
even
so
she
made
me
cut
my
price
in
half
leaving
me
only
twofifty
according
to
my
agreement
with
miss
francis
but
it
was
an
icebreaker
i
got
the
pump
and
hose
collecting
at
the
same
time
an
audience
of
brats
who
assisted
me
by
shouting
what
ya
goin
a
do
mister
at
thing
for
mister
you
goin
a
water
mrs
dinkman
frontyard
mister
do
your
teeth
awwis
look
so
funny
mister
my
grampa
takes
his
teeth
out
at
night
and
puts
in
a
glass
of
water
do
you
take
out
your
teeth
at
night
mister
you
goin
a
put
that
stuff
on
our
garden
too
mister
hay
shirley
come
on
over
and
see
the
funnylooking
man
fixing
up
dinkman
yard
they
were
untiring
shrilling
their
questions
exclamations
and
comments
completely
driving
from
my
mind
the
details
of
the
actual
application
of
the
metamorphizer
anyway
miss
francis
had
been
concerned
with
putting
it
in
the
irrigation
water
which
didnt
apply
in
this
case
i
thought
a
moment
a
gallon
was
enough
for
thirty
acres
half
a
pint
should
suffice
for
this
more
than
suffice
irrigation
water
nonsense
i
squirt
it
on
and
tell
the
woman
to
hose
it
down
afterward
that
be
the
same
as
putting
it
in
the
water
wouldnt
it
to
come
to
this
practical
conclusion
under
the
brunt
of
the
assault
was
a
remarkable
feat
as
i
dribbled
the
stuff
over
the
sorry
devilgrass
they
kicked
the
pump
and
my
shins
mimicking
my
actions
tripping
me
as
they
skipped
under
my
legs
getting
wet
with
the
metamorphizer
i
hoped
with
mutually
deleterious
effect
and
generally
making
me
more
than
ever
thankful
for
my
bachelor
condition
twofifty
i
thought
angrily
squirting
a
fine
mist
at
a
particularly
dreary
spot
and
it
isnt
even
selling
manual
labor
working
with
my
hands
i
might
as
well
be
a
gardener
college
training
wide
experience
alert
and
aggressive
in
order
to
dribble
stuff
smelling
sickeningly
of
carnations
on
a
wasted
yard
i
coiled
up
my
hose
disgustedly
and
collected
a
reluctant
five
dollars
it
do
look
any
different
commented
mrs
dinkman
dubiously
madam
professor
francis
remarkable
discovery
works
miracles
but
not
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
in
a
week
youll
see
for
yourself
provided
of
course
you
wet
it
down
properly
in
a
week
youll
be
far
gone
with
my
five
dollars
diagnosed
mrs
dinkman
while
this
might
be
superficially
true
it
was
an
unfair
and
unkind
thing
to
say
and
it
wounded
me
i
reached
into
my
pocket
and
drew
out
an
old
card
one
printed
before
i
had
an
irreconcilable
difference
with
the
firm
employing
me
at
the
time
i
can
always
be
reached
at
this
address
mrs
dinkman
i
said
should
you
have
any
cause
for
dissatisfaction
which
i
sure
is
quite
impossible
besides
i
shall
be
daily
in
this
district
demonstrating
the
value
of
dr
francis
lawn
tonic
that
was
certainly
true
unless
i
made
a
better
connection
degrading
manual
labor
or
not
i
intended
to
sell
as
many
local
people
as
possible
on
the
strength
of
having
found
a
weak
spot
in
the
wall
of
salesresistance
before
the
effects
of
the
metamorphizer
became
apparent
for
in
strict
confidence
and
despite
its
being
an
undesirable
negative
attitude
i
was
a
little
dubious
that
those
effects
or
lack
of
them
would
stimulate
further
sales
my
alarmclock
as
it
did
every
morning
sundays
included
rang
at
sixthirty
for
i
am
a
man
of
habit
i
turned
it
off
remembering
instantly
i
had
given
miss
francis
neither
her
pump
nor
her
share
of
the
sale
of
course
it
was
more
convenient
and
timesaving
to
bring
them
both
together
and
i
was
sure
she
didnt
expect
me
to
follow
instructions
to
the
letter
like
an
officeboy
any
more
in
these
matters
than
she
had
in
her
restriction
to
agricultural
use
still
it
was
remiss
of
me
the
fact
is
i
had
spent
her
money
as
well
as
my
own
not
on
dissipation
i
hasten
to
say
but
on
dinner
and
an
installment
of
my
roomrent
this
was
embarrassing
but
i
looked
upon
it
merely
as
an
advance
quite
as
if
i
had
the
customary
drawingaccount
to
be
charged
against
my
next
commissions
my
acceptance
of
the
advance
merely
indicated
my
faith
in
the
future
of
the
metamorphizer
i
dissolved
a
yeastcake
in
a
glass
of
water
it
very
healthy
and
heard
it
alleviated
dermal
irritations
lathering
my
face
i
glanced
over
the
list
culled
from
the
dictionary
and
stuck
in
the
mirror
the
night
before
for
i
have
never
been
too
tired
to
improve
my
mind
by
this
easy
method
of
increasing
my
vocabulary
i
had
progressed
at
the
time
down
to
the
letter
while
drinking
my
coffee
never
more
than
two
cups
it
was
my
custom
to
read
and
digest
stock
and
bond
quotations
for
though
i
had
no
investments
the
only
time
i
had
been
able
to
take
a
flurry
there
was
an
unforeseen
recession
in
the
market
i
thought
a
man
who
didnt
keep
up
with
trends
and
conditions
unfitted
for
a
place
in
the
businessworld
besides
i
didnt
expect
to
be
straitened
indefinitely
and
i
believed
in
being
ready
to
take
proper
advantage
of
opportunity
when
it
came
as
a
man
may
devote
the
graver
part
of
his
mind
to
a
subject
and
then
turn
for
relaxation
to
a
lighter
aspect
so
i
had
for
years
been
interested
in
a
stock
called
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
concentrates
it
wasnt
a
highpriced
issue
nor
were
its
fluctuations
startling
for
six
months
of
the
year
year
in
and
year
out
it
would
be
quoted
at
of
a
cent
a
share
for
the
other
six
months
it
stood
at
i
didnt
know
what
pemmican
was
and
i
didnt
particularly
care
but
if
a
man
could
invest
at
he
could
double
his
money
overnight
when
it
rose
to
then
he
could
reverse
the
process
by
selling
before
it
went
down
and
so
snowball
into
fortune
it
was
a
daydream
but
a
harmless
one
satisfying
myself
consolidated
pemmican
was
bumbling
along
at
its
low
level
i
reluctantly
prepared
to
resume
miss
francis
pump
it
seemed
less
heavy
as
i
wound
the
hose
over
my
shoulder
and
i
felt
this
wasnt
due
to
the
negligible
quantity
i
expended
on
mrs
dinkman
grass
i
just
knew
i
was
going
to
have
a
successful
day
i
had
to
in
moments
of
fancy
i
often
think
a
salesman
is
more
truly
a
creative
artist
than
many
of
those
who
arrogate
the
title
to
themselves
he
uses
words
on
one
hand
and
the
receptivity
of
prospects
on
the
other
to
mold
a
cohesive
and
satisfying
whole
a
work
of
art
signed
and
dated
on
the
dotted
line
like
any
such
work
the
creation
implies
thoughtful
and
careful
preparation
so
it
was
that
i
got
off
the
bus
polishing
a
new
salestalk
to
fit
the
changed
situation
one
of
your
neighbors
i
have
just
applied
i
sneered
my
way
past
those
houses
refusing
my
services
the
day
before
they
couldnt
have
the
metamorphizer
at
any
price
now
then
it
hit
my
eyes
mrs
dinkman
lawn
i
mean
the
one
so
neglected
ailing
and
yellow
only
yesterday
it
wasnt
sad
and
sickly
now
the
most
enthusiastic
homeowner
wouldnt
have
disdained
it
there
wasnt
a
single
bare
spot
visible
in
the
whole
lush
healthy
expanse
and
it
was
green
green
not
just
here
and
there
but
over
every
inch
of
soft
undulating
surface
a
pale
applegreen
where
the
blades
waved
to
expose
its
underparts
and
a
rich
dazzling
emerald
on
top
even
the
runners
sinuously
encroaching
upon
the
sidewalk
were
deeply
virescent
the
metamorphizer
worked
the
metamorphizer
not
only
worked
but
it
worked
with
unbelievable
rapidity
overnight
i
knew
nothing
about
the
speed
at
which
ordinary
fertilizers
plant
stimulants
or
hormones
took
hold
but
commonsense
told
me
nothing
like
this
had
ever
happened
so
quickly
i
had
been
indulging
in
a
little
legitimate
puffery
in
saying
the
inoculant
worked
miracles
but
if
anything
that
had
been
an
understatement
it
just
went
to
show
how
impossible
it
is
for
a
real
salesman
to
be
too
enthusiastic
nerves
in
knees
and
fingers
quivering
i
walked
over
to
join
the
group
curiously
inspecting
the
translated
lawn
i
had
done
this
out
of
the
most
miserable
i
made
the
loveliest
and
for
a
paltry
five
dollars
i
tried
to
recapture
the
memory
of
what
it
had
looked
like
in
order
to
relish
the
contrast
more
but
it
was
impossible
the
vivid
present
blotted
out
the
decayed
past
completely
overnight
someone
said
yessir
just
overnight
wouldnt
of
believed
it
if
i
hadnt
noticed
just
yesterday
how
much
worse
an
the
city
dump
it
looked
bet
at
stuff
ten
inches
high
brother
you
can
say
that
again
foot
be
closer
anyhow
it
uh
fattestlookin
grass
i
seen
sence
i
lef
texas
an
the
greenest
guess
i
never
did
see
such
a
green
before
while
they
exclaimed
about
the
beauty
and
vigor
of
the
growth
my
mind
was
racing
in
high
along
practical
lines
achievement
isnt
worth
much
unless
you
can
harness
it
and
in
today
triumph
i
saw
benefit
no
more
canvassing
with
a
pump
undignifiedly
on
my
back
no
more
manual
labor
no
bold
as
the
thought
was
not
even
any
more
direct
selling
for
me
this
was
big
too
big
to
be
approached
in
any
cockroach
way
it
was
a
real
top
deal
in
a
class
with
nylon
or
jukeboxes
or
bubblegum
you
could
smell
the
money
in
it
first
of
all
i
have
to
tie
josephine
francis
down
with
an
ironclad
contract
agents
dealerships
distributors
and
a
general
salesmanager
albert
weener
at
the
top
incorporate
get
it
all
down
in
black
and
white
and
signed
by
miss
francis
right
away
for
her
own
good
an
idealistic
scientist
a
frail
woman
protect
her
from
the
vultures
try
to
rob
her
as
soon
as
they
saw
what
the
metamorphizer
would
do
such
a
woman
wouldnt
have
any
business
sense
i
see
she
got
a
comfortable
living
out
of
it
and
free
her
from
responsibility
then
she
could
potter
around
all
she
liked
incorporate
interest
big
money

it
on
a
nationwide
basis
a
cut
for
the
general
salesmanager

every
sale

my
way
to
being
a
millionaire
i
had
certainly
been
right
up
on
my
toes
in
picking
the
metamorphizer
as
a
winner
in
spite
of
miss
francis
kitchen
and
her
lack
of
aggressiveness
instinct
the
unerring
instinct
of
a
wideawake
salesman
for
the
right
product
and
for
the
right
market
i
mustnt
forget
that
had
i
been
content
with
her
original
limitation
i
still
be
bumbling
around
trying
to
interest
farmer
hicks
in
some
metamorphizer
for
his
hay
ja
notice
how
thick
it
was
well
that
bermuda
for
you
tell
me
they
actually
plant
it
on
purpose
in
florida
no
kiddin
yessir
know
one
thing
even
if
it
looks
pretty
right
now
i
wouldnt
want
that
stuff
on
my
place
have
to
cut
it
every
day
bet
ya
toughlookin
too
i
rather
take
my
exercise
in
bed
that
an
angle
i
thought
have
to
get
old
lady
francis
to
modify
her
formula
or
something
else
we
never
get
rich
slow
down
the
rate
of
growth
dilute
it
ought
to
be
more
profitable
too
have
to
find
out
how
cheaply
the
inoculant
can
be
produced
no
more
inefficient
hand
methods
of
course
the
fastness
of
growth
wouldnt
affect
the
sale
to
farmers
help
it
in
fact
no
doubt
she
had
more
than
i
originally
thought
in
that
aspect
i
conceded
generously
we
could
let
them
apply
it
themselves
mailorder
advertising
cut
costs
that
way
think
of
clover
and
alfalfa
or
werent
they
grasses
anyway
imagine
hay
or
wheat
as
tall
as
iowa
corn
and
corn
higher
than
a
smalltown
cityhall
fortune
there
be
a
dozen
fortunes
in
it
i
began
perspiring
the
deal
was
getting
bigger
and
bigger
it
wasnt
just
a
simple
matter
of
cutting
in
on
a
good
thing
all
the
angles
which
were
multiplying
at
a
tremendous
rate
had
to
be
covered
before
i
saw
miss
francis
again
i
darent
miss
any
bets
i
needed
a
staff
of
agricultural
experts
anyway
someone
who
could
cover
the
scientific
side
whatever
happened
to
my
freshman
chemistry
and
a
mob
of
lawyers
you
have
to
plug
every
loophole
tight
but
here
i
was
without
a
financial
resource
couldnt
hire
a
ditchdigger
much
less
the
highpriced
talent
i
needed
and
someone
else
might
get
a
brainstorm
when
he
saw
the
lawn
and
beat
me
to
it
i
visioned
myself
cheated
of
my
million
yes
a
really
fast
worker
some
unethical
promoter
willing
to
stoop
to
devious
methods
might
pass
at
any
moment
and
grasp
the
possibilities
have
miss
francis
signed
up
before
i
even
got
the
deal
straight
in
my
mind
how
could
he
miss
seeing
this
lawn
splendid
magnificent
beautiful
no
one
would
ever
call
this
stuff
devilgrass
angelgrass
would
be
more
appropriate
to
the
implications
of
such
a
heavenly
green
millions
in
it
simply
millions
say
arent
you
the
fellow
put
this
stuff
on
halfadozen
vacant
faces
gaped
at
me
the
burdening
pump
the
caudal
hose
curiosity
interest
imbecile
amusement
argued
in
their
expression
with
the
respect
due
the
worker
of
the
transformation
it
was
the
sort
of
look
connected
with
salesresistance
of
the
most
obstinate
kind
they
distracted
me
from
thinking
things
through
miz
dinkman
sure
looking
for
you
says
she
going
to
sue
you
here
was
an
unfortunate
development
an
angle
to
end
all
angles
unfavorable
publicity
the
abortifacient
of
new
enterprises
would
mean
you
could
hardly
give
the
stuff
away
my
imagination
raced
through
columns
of
newsprint
in
which
the
metamorphizer
was
made
the
butt
of
reporters
humor
mrs
dinkman
ire
would
have
to
be
placated
bought
off
perhaps
i
better
discuss
developments
with
miss
francis
right
away
afterall
whatever
i
decided
it
was
advisable
for
me
to
leave
this
vicinity
i
was
in
no
financial
position
to
soothe
mrs
dinkman
and
it
was
dubious
in
view
of
her
attitude
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
sell
any
more
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
probably
a
new
territory
was
the
answer
to
my
problem
a
few
sales
would
give
me
both
cash
in
hand
and
time
to
think
while
i
hesitated
mrs
dinkman
belligerency
dancing
like
a
sparkling
aura
about
her
came
out
of
her
garage
with
a
rusty
rattling
lawnmower
i
no
authority
on
gardentools
but
this
creaking
rickety
machine
was
clearly
no
match
for
the
lusty
growth
the
audience
felt
so
too
and
there
was
a
stir
of
sporting
interest
as
they
settled
down
to
watch
the
contest
determination
was
implicit
in
the
sharply
unnatural
lines
of
her
corset
and
the
firm
set
of
her
glasses
as
she
charged
into
the
gently
swaying
runners
the
wheels
turned
rebelliously
the
mower
bit
its
rusty
blades
grated
against
the
knife
something
clanked
forcibly
and
the
machine
stopped
dinkman
pushed
her
back
arched
with
effort
the
mower
didnt
budge
she
pulled
it
back
it
whirred
gratefully
the
clanking
stopped
and
she
tried
again
this
time
it
chewed
a
handful
of
grass
from
the
edge
found
it
distasteful
and
quit
once
more
anybody
know
how
to
make
this
damn
thing
work
mrs
dinkman
asked
exasperatedly
needs
oil
was
helpfully
volunteered
she
retired
into
the
garage
and
returned
with
a
lopsided
oilcan
oil
it
she
commanded
regally
the
helpful
one
reluctantly
pressed
his
thumb
against
the
wry
bottom
of
the
can
aiming
the
twisted
spout
at
odd
parts
of
the
mower
i
dunno
he
commented
i
do
either
said
mrs
dinkman
you
greener
weener
whatever
your
name
is
there
was
no
possibility
of
evasion
yes
mam
you
made
this
stuff
grow
now
you
can
cut
it
down
uncouth
guffaws
from
the
watching
idiots
mrs
dinkman
i
get
behind
that
lawnmower
young
man
if
you
do
want
to
be
involved
in
a
lawsuit
i
wasnt
afraid
of
such
a
consequence
in
itself
having
at
the
moment
nothing
to
attach
but
i
thought
of
miss
francis
and
future
sales
and
that
impalpable
thing
known
as
goodwill
yes
mam
i
repeated
i
discarded
pump
and
hose
to
move
reluctantly
toward
the
mower
under
my
feet
i
felt
the
springiness
of
the
grass
was
it
pure
fancy
or
did
it
truly
differ
in
quality
from
the
lawns
i
trod
so
indifferently
the
day
before
i
took
the
handle
if
oiling
had
improved
the
machine
its
previous
efficiency
must
have
been
slight
it
went
shakily
over
the
first
inch
of
grass
and
then
as
it
had
for
mrs
dinkman
it
stopped
for
me
by
now
the
spectators
had
increased
to
a
small
crowd
and
their
dull
humor
had
taken
the
form
of
cheerfully
offering
much
gratuitous
advice
tie
into
it
slim
build
up
the
old
muscle
back
her
up
and
take
a
good
run
go
home
an
do
some
settinup
exercises
come
back
next
year
got
to
put
the
old
back
behind
it
bud
give
her
the
gas
need
a
decent
mower
no
use
trying
to
cut
stuff
like
that
with
an
antique
yeah
get
a
good
mower
one
made
since
the
civil
war
no
one
around
here
got
an
honestogod
lawnmower
the
last
query
evidently
nettled
local
pride
for
soon
a
blithe
beamshouldered
little
man
trundled
up
a
shiny
rubbertired
machine
thisll
do
the
business
he
announced
confidently
as
i
relinquished
the
spotlight
to
him
with
understandable
readiness
it
a
regular
jimdandy
it
certainly
was
the
devilgrass
came
irreverently
above
the
wheels
and
flowed
with
graceful
inquisitiveness
over
the
blades
but
the
brisk
little
man
pushed
heartily
and
the
mechanism
revolved
with
a
barely
audible
clicking
it
did
not
balk
complain
or
hesitate
cleanly
severed
ends
of
grass
whirled
into
the
air
and
floated
down
on
the
neat
smooth
swath
left
behind
everyone
smiled
relievedly
at
the
jimdandy
triumph
and
my
sigh
was
loudest
and
most
heartfelt
i
edged
away
as
unobtrusively
as
i
could
i
have
no
sympathy
with
weaklings
who
complain
of
the
cards
being
stacked
but
it
did
seem
as
though
fate
were
dealing
unkindly
with
me
here
was
a
good
proposition
coming
just
at
the
time
i
needed
it
most
and
it
was
turning
bad
rapidly
walking
the
short
distance
to
miss
francis
i
was
unable
to
settle
my
mind
to
strike
a
mental
balancesheet
there
was
money
there
had
to
be
money
lots
and
lots
of
it
in
the
metamorphizer
but
it
was
possible
there
was
trouble
lots
and
lots
of
it
also
the
thing
was
well
dangerous
what
was
the
use
of
expending
ability
in
selling
something
which
could
have
kickbacks
acting
as
deterrents
to
future
sales
of
course
a
man
had
to
take
risks
the
door
after
a
properly
prudent
hesitation
clicked
brokenly
miss
francis
looked
as
though
she
added
insomnia
to
her
other
abstentions
otherwise
she
had
not
changed
even
to
her
skirt
and
the
smudge
on
her
left
nostril
if
youve
come
about
the
icebox
youre
a
week
late
i
fixed
it
myself
she
greeted
me
gruffly
weener
i
reminded
her
albert
weener
remember
i
selling
that
is
i
going
to
sell
the
product
you
invented
to
make
plants
eat
anything
oh
weener
yes
she
produced
the
toothpick
and
scratched
her
chin
with
it
about
the
metamorphizer
she
paused
and
rubbed
her
elbow
a
mistake
i
afraid
an
error
aha
i
thought
a
new
deal
someone
offered
to
back
her
steal
her
brainchild
negate
all
my
efforts
to
make
her
independent
and
cheat
me
of
the
reward
of
my
spadework
you
wouldnt
think
of
her
as
a
frail
credulous
woman
easily
taken
in
by
the
first
smooth
talker
but
a
woman
is
a
woman
afterall
look
miss
francis
i
argued
youve
got
a
big
thing
here
a
great
thing
the
possibilities
are
practically
unlimited
of
course
youll
have
to
have
a
manager
to
put
it
across
an
executive
a
man
with
business
experience
someone
who
can
tap
the
great
reservoir
of
buying
power
by
the
conviction
of
a
new
need
organize
a
sales
campaign
rationalize
production
put
the
whole
thing
on
a
commercial
basis
for
all
this
you
need
a
man
who
has
contacted
the
public
on
every
level
preferably
doortodoor
and
with
a
varied
background
she
strode
past
the
stove
which
had
gathered
new
accreta
during
the
night
and
looked
in
the
cloudy
mirror
as
though
searching
for
a
misplaced
thought
no
doubt
weener
no
doubt
but
before
all
these
romantically
streamlined
things
eventuate
there
must
be
a
hiatus
in
my
haste
i
overlooked
a
detail
yesterday
trivial
maybe
perhaps
vital
i
should
never
have
let
you
start
out
so
soon
this
was
bad
i
was
struggling
now
for
my
job
and
for
the
future
of
the
metamorphizer
miss
francis
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
mistakes
or
trivial
details
or
how
i
could
have
started
out
too
soon
but
whatever
the
trouble
is
i
sure
it
can
be
smoothed
out
easily
sometimes
you
know
obstacles
which
appear
tremendous
prove
to
be
nothing
at
all
in
experienced
hands
i
myself
have
had
occasion
to
put
things
right
for
a
number
of
different
concerns
really
miss
francis
you
mustnt
let
opportunity
slip
through
your
fingers
believe
me
i
know
what
a
big
thing
your
discovery
is
ive
seen
what
it
does
she
turned
those
too
sharp
eyes
on
me
discomfortingly
ah
she
said
so
soon
well
i
began
it
certainly
acted
quickly
i
stopped
when
i
saw
she
wasnt
hearing
me
she
sat
down
in
the
only
empty
chair
and
drummed
her
fingers
against
big
white
teeth
even
under
a
microscope
she
muttered
no
perceptible
reaction
for
fortyeight
hours
laboratory
conditions
or
my
own
idiocy
but
i
approximated
her
voice
trailed
off
and
for
a
full
minute
the
absolute
silence
of
the
kitchen
was
broken
only
by
the
melodramatic
dripping
of
a
tap
she
made
an
effort
to
pull
herself
together
and
addressed
me
in
her
old
abrupt
way
corn
or
wheat
ay
you
said
youve
seen
what
it
does
i
asked
you
if
you
had
applied
it
to
corn
or
wheat
or
what
she
was
looking
at
me
so
fixedly
i
had
a
slight
difficulty
in
putting
my
words
in
good
order
it
was
neither
mam
i
applied
some
of
the
stuff
to
a
lawn
a
weener
mam
but
i
said
general
instructions
miss
francis
i
sure
you
didnt
mean
to
tie
my
hands
another
long
silence
no
weener
i
didnt
mean
to
tie
your
hands
well
as
i
was
saying
i
applied
some
of
the
stuff
to
a
lawn
exactly
according
to
your
instructions
in
the
irrigation
water
well
not
precisely
but
just
as
good
i
assure
you
go
on
a
terrible
lawn
all
shot
last
night
this
morning
stop
what
kind
of
grass
or
do
you
know
of
course
i
know
i
answered
indignantly
did
she
think
i
was
an
idiot
it
was
devilgrass
ah
she
rubbed
the
back
of
her
hand
against
her
singularly
smooth
cheek
bermuda
stupid
stupid
stupid
how
could
i
have
been
so
blind
did
i
think
only
the
corn
would
be
affected
and
not
the
weeds
in
the
furrows
or
that
something
like
this
might
not
happen
i
didnt
feel
like
wasting
any
more
time
listening
to
her
soliloquy
this
morning
i
continued
it
was
as
green
all
right
weener
spare
me
your
poetry
show
it
to
me
well
now
miss
francis
i
wanted
understandably
enough
to
discuss
future
arrangements
before
she
saw
dinkman
lawn
immediately
weener
when
dealing
with
childish
persons
you
have
to
cater
to
their
whims
i
rid
myself
of
the
pump
i
never
dreamed
i
be
reluctant
to
part
with
the
monster
while
she
made
perfunctory
and
unconvincing
motions
to
fit
herself
for
the
street
of
course
she
neither
washed
nor
madeup
but
she
peered
in
the
glass
argumentatively
pulled
her
jacket
down
decisively
threw
her
shoulders
back
to
raise
it
askew
again
and
gave
the
swirl
of
hair
a
halfhearted
pat
i
like
to
go
over
the
matter
of
organizing
not
now
i
was
naturally
reluctant
to
be
seen
on
the
street
with
so
conspicuous
a
figure
but
i
could
hardly
escape
i
tried
to
match
her
swinging
stride
but
as
she
was
at
least
six
inches
taller
i
had
to
give
a
sort
of
skip
between
steps
which
was
less
than
dignified
searching
my
mind
to
find
a
tactful
approach
again
to
the
subject
of
proper
distribution
of
the
metamorphizer
i
felt
my
opportunity
slipping
away
every
moment
she
on
her
part
was
silent
and
so
abstracted
that
i
often
had
to
put
out
a
guiding
hand
to
avert
collision
with
other
pedestrians
or
stationary
objects
i
doubt
if
i
been
gone
from
mrs
dinkman
threequarters
of
an
hour
i
had
left
a
small
group
excited
at
the
free
show
consequent
upon
the
too
successful
beautification
of
a
local
eyesore
i
returned
to
a
sizable
crowd
viewing
an
impressive
phenomenon
the
homely
levity
had
vanished
no
one
shouted
jovial
advice
opinions
and
comments
passed
in
whispers
accompanied
by
furtive
glances
toward
the
lawn
as
though
it
were
sentient
and
might
be
offended
by
rude
speculation
as
we
pushed
through
the
bystanders
i
was
suddenly
aware
of
their
cautious
avoidance
of
contact
with
the
grass
itself
the
nearest
onlookers
stood
a
respectful
yard
back
and
when
unbalanced
by
the
push
of
those
behind
went
through
such
antics
to
avoid
treading
on
it
while
at
the
same
time
preserving
the
convention
of
innocence
of
any
taboo
that
they
frequently
pivoted
and
pirouetted
on
one
foot
in
an
awkward
ballet
the
very
hiding
of
their
inhibition
emphasized
the
new
awesomeness
of
the
grass
it
was
no
longer
to
be
lightly
approached
or
frivolously
treated
now
i
am
not
what
is
generally
called
a
man
of
religious
sensibilities
having
long
ago
discarded
belief
in
the
supernatural
and
i
am
not
overcome
at
odd
moments
by
mystical
feelings
furthermore
i
had
been
intimate
with
this
particular
patch
of
vegetation
for
some
eighteen
hours
i
had
viewed
its
decaying
state
i
had
injected
life
into
it
i
had
seen
it
in
the
first
flush
of
resurrection
in
spite
of
all
this
i
too
fell
under
the
spell
of
the
grass
and
knew
something
compounded
of
wonder
and
apprehension
the
neatly
cut
swaths
of
the
little
man
with
the
jimdandy
mower
came
to
a
dramatic
end
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
beyond
this
shorn
portion
the
grass
rose
in
a
threatening
crest
taller
than
a
man
knees
green
aloof
and
derisive
but
it
was
not
this
forbidding
sight
which
gave
me
such
a
queer
turn
it
was
the
mown
part
for
i
recalled
how
the
brisk
man
machine
had
cut
close
and
left
behind
short
crisp
stems
now
this
piece
was
almost
as
high
as
when
i
first
seen
it
grown
faster
in
an
hour
than
ordinary
grass
in
a
month
i
stole
a
look
at
miss
francis
to
see
how
she
was
taking
the
sight
but
there
was
no
emotion
visible
on
her
face
the
toothpick
was
once
more
in
play
and
the
luminous
eyes
fixed
straight
ahead
her
legs
were
spread
apart
and
she
seemed
firmly
in
position
for
hours
to
come
as
though
she
would
wait
for
the
grass
to
exhaust
its
phenomenal
growth
why
did
they
quit
cutting
i
asked
the
man
standing
beside
me
mower
give
out
dulled
the
blades
so
they
wouldnt
cut
no
more
going
to
give
up
and
let
it
grow
hell
no
sent
for
a
gardener
with
a
powermower
big
one
cut
anything
ought
to
be
here
now
he
was
too
honking
the
crowd
from
the
driveway
mrs
dinkman
was
with
him
looking
at
once
indignant
persecuted
uncomfortable
and
selfrighteous
it
was
evident
they
had
failed
to
reach
any
agreement
the
gardener
slammed
the
door
of
the
senescent
truck
with
vehement
lack
of
affection
i
cut
lots
a
devilgrass
lady
but
i
wo
tie
into
this
overgrown
stuff
at
that
price
you
got
no
right
to
expect
it
i
know
what
fair
and
it
not
reasonable
to
count
on
me
cutting
this
like
it
was
an
ordinary
lawn
you
know
yourself
it
isnt
fair
i
give
you
ten
dollars
and
that
my
last
word
listen
lady
when
i
get
through
this
job
i
have
to
take
my
mower
apart
and
have
it
resharpened
you
think
i
can
afford
to
do
that
for
a
tendollar
job
ten
dollars
repeated
mrs
dinkman
firmly
the
gardener
appealed
to
the
gallery
listen
folks
now
i
ask
you
is
this
fair
i
willing
to
be
reasonable
i
understand
this
lady
in
trouble
and
i
willing
to
help
but
i
ca
do
a
twentyfivedollar
job
for
ten
bucks
can
i
it
was
doubtful
if
the
observers
were
particularly
concerned
with
justice
what
they
desired
was
action
swift
and
drastic
a
general
resentment
at
being
balked
of
their
amusement
was
manifest
in
murmurs
of
go
ahead
do
it
what
the
matter
with
you
do
be
dumb
do
it
for
nothing
youll
get
plenty
business
out
of
it
they
appealed
to
his
nobler
and
baser
natures
but
he
remained
adamant
not
to
be
balked
by
his
churlishness
they
passed
a
hat
and
collected
which
i
thought
a
remarkably
generous
admission
price
when
this
was
added
to
mrs
dinkman
ten
dollars
the
gardener
still
protesting
reluctantly
agreed
to
perform
mrs
dinkman
prudently
holding
the
total
he
unloaded
the
powermower
with
many
flourishes
making
quite
an
undertaking
of
oiling
and
adjusting
the
roller
setting
the
blades
bending
down
to
assure
himself
of
the
gasoline
in
the
small
tank
finally
wheeling
the
contraption
into
place
with
great
spirit
the
motor
started
with
a
disgruntled
put
changing
into
a
series
of
resigned
explosions
as
he
guided
it
over
the
lawn
crosswise
to
the
lines
of
his
predecessor
miss
francis
followed
every
motion
with
rapt
attention
did
you
expect
this
i
asked
ay
the
abnormally
stimulated
growth
you
mean
yes
yes
and
no
work
in
the
laboratory
didnt
indicate
it
my
own
fault
i
didnt
realize
at
once
making
available
so
much
free
nitrogen
would
have
such
instant
results
but
last
night
yes
not
now
later
the
powermower
went
nicely
i
might
almost
say
smoothly
over
the
stuff
cut
before
muttering
and
chickling
happily
to
itself
as
it
dragged
the
panting
gardener
inescapably
harnessed
in
its
wake
but
the
mown
area
was
narrow
and
the
machine
quickly
jerked
through
it
and
made
the
last
easy
journey
along
the
wall
of
untouched
devilgrass
beyond
the
gardener
without
hesitation
aimed
his
machine
at
the
thicket
of
grass
it
growled
slowed
coughed
spat
struggled
and
thrashed
on
and
finally
conked
out
ah
said
miss
francis
oh
said
the
spectators
sonofabitch
said
the
gardener
he
yanked
the
grumbling
mower
back
angrily
inspecting
its
mechanism
in
the
manner
of
a
mother
with
a
wayward
son
and
began
again
there
was
desperate
determination
in
his
shoulders
as
he
added
his
forward
thrust
to
the
protesting
rhythm
the
machine
went
at
the
grass
like
a
bulldog
attacking
a
borzoi
it
bit
chewed
held
on
it
cut
a
new
six
inches
readily
another
foot
slowly
and
then
with
jolts
and
misfires
and
loud
imprecations
from
the
gardener
it
gave
up
again
you
judged
mrs
dinkman
do
know
how
to
cut
grass
the
gardener
wiped
his
sweaty
forehead
with
the
inside
of
his
wrist
you
you
should
have
a
law
against
you
he
answered
bitterly
and
inadequately
but
the
crowd
evidently
agreed
with
mrs
dinkman
verdict
for
there
were
mutterings
of
it
a
farmer
job
get
somebody
with
a
scythe
that
right
get
a
scythe
got
to
have
a
scythe
to
cut
hay
like
that
these
remarks
uttered
loudly
enough
for
him
to
hear
so
discouraged
the
gardener
that
after
three
more
futile
tries
he
reloaded
his
equipment
and
left
amidst
jeers
and
expressions
of
disfavor
without
attempting
to
collect
any
of
the
money
for
some
reason
the
failure
of
the
powermower
lightened
the
atmosphere
everyone
including
mrs
dinkman
seemed
convinced
that
scything
was
the
solution
tension
relaxed
and
the
bystanders
began
talking
in
something
above
a
whisper
this
will
just
about
ruin
our
sales
i
said
miss
francis
suspended
the
toothpick
before
her
chin
and
looked
at
me
as
though
i
said
dirty
words
in
the
presence
of
ladies
well
it
will
i
argued
you
ca
expect
people
to
have
their
lawns
inoculated
if
they
find
out
it
going
to
make
grass
act
this
way
her
eyes
might
have
been
microscopes
and
i
something
smeared
on
a
slide
weener
youre
the
sort
of
man
who
peddles
begins
at
to
the
inmates
of
an
old
peoples
home
i
couldnt
see
what
had
upset
her
the
last
idea
had
sound
salesappeal
but
it
was
a
low
income
market
oh
well
her
queer
notions
and
obscure
reactions
undoubtedly
went
with
her
scientific
gift
you
have
to
lead
individuals
of
this
type
for
their
own
good
otherwise
they
spend
their
lives
wandering
around
in
a
dreamy
fog
accomplishing
nothing
i
still
believe
youve
got
something
i
pointed
out
you
yourself
said
it
wasnt
perfected
but
perhaps
you
havent
realized
how
far
from
marketable
it
actually
is
yet
now
then
i
went
on
reasonably
youre
just
going
to
have
to
dilute
it
or
change
it
or
do
something
to
it
so
while
it
will
make
grass
nice
and
green
it
wo
let
it
grow
wild
like
this
the
fixed
look
could
be
annoying
it
was
nearly
impossible
to
turn
your
eyes
away
without
rudeness
once
she
caught
them
weener
the
metamorphizer
is
neither
fertilizer
nor
plant
food
it
is
a
chemical
compound
producing
a
controlled
mutation
in
any
treated
member
of
the
family
gramineae
dilution
might
make
it
not
work
the
mutation
might
not
take
place
but
it
couldnt
make
it
half
work
i
could
change
your
nature
by
forcibly
injecting
an
ounce
of
lead
into
your
cerebellum
the
change
would
not
only
be
irrevocable
but
it
wouldnt
make
the
slightest
difference
if
the
lead
were
adulterated
with
ironpyrites
or
not
but
miss
francis
i
expostulated
you
have
to
do
she
threw
her
hands
into
the
air
a
theatrical
gesture
even
more
than
ordinarily
unbecoming
why
why
to
make
your
discovery
marketable
of
course
now
in
the
face
of
this
miss
francis
i
said
with
dignity
you
are
a
lady
and
my
selfrespect
makes
me
treat
you
with
the
courtesy
due
your
sex
you
advertised
for
a
salesman
instead
of
sneering
at
my
honest
efforts
to
put
your
merchandise
across
to
the
public
i
think
youd
be
better
advised
to
worry
about
such
lowbrow
things
as
keeping
faith
am
i
to
keep
faith
in
a
vacuum
you
came
to
me
as
a
salesman
and
i
must
give
you
something
to
sell
this
is
simple
morality
but
if
such
a
grant
entails
concomitant
evils
surely
i
am
absolved
of
my
original
contract
i
do
know
what
youre
talking
about
i
told
her
frankly
your
stuff
made
the
grass
grow
too
fast
that
all
you
should
change
the
formula
or
find
a
new
one
or
else
or
else
youll
have
been
left
with
nothing
to
sell
i
despair
of
making
the
point
about
changing
the
formula
your
trust
in
my
powers
is
too
reverent
again
i
not
an
arrogant
woman
and
i
admit
to
some
responsibility
make
the
world
fit
for
alfred
weener
to
make
a
living
in
it
albert
not
alfred
i
corrected
her
i
not
touchy
goodness
knows
but
afterall
a
name
a
piece
of
property
your
pardon
albert
she
looked
down
at
me
with
such
a
placatory
and
genuinely
feminine
smile
i
decided
i
been
foolish
to
be
offended
she
a
nut
of
course
i
thought
indulgently
someone
whose
life
is
bounded
by
theories
and
testtubes
a
woman
with
no
conception
of
practical
reality
instead
of
being
affronted
it
would
be
better
to
show
her
patiently
how
essential
my
help
was
to
her
of
all
people
she
went
on
searching
my
face
with
those
discomfiting
eyes
of
all
people
ive
the
least
cause
for
moral
snobbery
anxious
to
get
a
few
dollars
to
carry
on
my
work
and
what
was
such
anxiety
but
selfindulgence
i
threw
the
metamorphizer
to
you
and
the
world
before
i
realized
that
it
was
not
only
imperfect
but
faulty
hell
is
paved
with
good
intentions
and
the
first
result
of
my
desire
to
benefit
mankind
has
been
to
injure
the
dinkmans
meditation
in
place
of
infatuation
would
have
shown
me
both
the
immediate
and
ultimate
wrongs
i
doubt
if
youd
been
gone
an
hour
yesterday
when
i
knew
i
made
a
blunder
in
permitting
you
to
go
out
with
danger
in
both
hands
i
do
know
what
youre
getting
at
i
said
stiffly
for
it
sounded
as
though
she
were
regarding
me
as
a
child
why
as
i
was
sitting
composing
my
thoughts
toward
extending
the
effectiveness
of
the
metamorphizer
beyond
gramina
it
suddenly
became
clear
to
me
i
erred
about
not
knowing
how
long
the
effect
of
the
inoculations
would
last
you
mean
you
found
out
if
she
brought
the
thing
under
control
and
the
effect
lasted
a
specified
time
there
might
be
repeat
business
afterall
i
found
out
a
great
deal
by
using
speculation
and
logic
for
a
change
instead
of
my
hands
and
memory
i
sat
and
thought
and
though
this
is
an
unorthodox
way
for
a
scientist
to
proceed
i
profited
by
it
i
reasoned
if
you
change
the
genetic
structure
of
a
plant
you
change
it
permanently
not
for
a
day
or
an
hour
but
for
its
existence
i
not
speaking
of
chance
mutations
you
understand
weener
coming
about
over
a
course
of
generations
generations
which
include
sports
degenerates
atavars
andsoforth
but
of
controlled
changes
brought
about
through
human
intervention
inoculation
by
the
metamorphizer
might
be
compared
to
cutting
off
a
man
leg
or
transplanting
part
of
his
brain
albert
what
happens
when
you
cut
off
a
man
leg
i
was
tired
of
being
talked
to
like
a
grammarschool
class
still
i
humored
her
why
then
he
has
only
one
leg
i
answered
agreeably
if
idiotically
true
more
than
that
he
has
a
onelegged
disposition
his
whole
ego
his
entire
spirit
is
changed
no
longer
a
twolegged
creature
reduced
he
is
another
warped
if
you
like
being
to
come
to
the
immediate
point
of
the
grass
if
you
engender
an
omnivorous
capacity
you
implant
an
insatiable
appetite
i
do
catch
if
you
give
a
man
a
big
belly
you
make
him
a
hog
a
chevvy
coupe
gently
breathing
steam
from
its
radiator
cap
interrupted
from
its
turtle
hung
the
blade
of
a
scythe
and
on
the
nervously
hinged
door
had
been
hopefully
lettered
barelli
plowing
while
the
coupe
was
trembling
for
some
seconds
before
quieting
down
i
sighed
a
double
relief
at
miss
francis
forgetfulness
of
the
money
due
her
and
the
soothing
of
my
fears
for
the
lawn
eating
its
way
downward
to
china
or
india
the
remark
about
gluttonous
abdomens
was
disturbing
and
of
course
there
will
be
no
further
sale
of
the
metamorphizer
she
concluded
her
eyes
now
totally
concerned
with
the
farmer
who
was
opening
the
turtle
with
the
air
of
a
man
expecting
to
be
unpleasantly
astonished
mr
barelli
came
as
to
a
deathbed
a
consoling
but
hopeless
smile
widening
his
narrow
face
only
inconsiderably
at
the
scythe
cradled
in
his
arms
someone
shouted
here
old
father
time
himself
mr
barelli
wasnt
amused
brushing
his
forehead
thoughtfully
with
tender
fingers
he
surveyed
with
saddened
eye
the
three
graduated
steps
of
grass
the
last
step
unessayed
by
his
predecessors
rose
nearly
four
feet
as
alien
to
the
concept
of
lawn
as
a
field
of
wheat
think
you
can
cut
it
one
of
the
audience
asked
mr
barelli
smiled
cheerlessly
and
didnt
answer
instead
he
uprooted
from
his
hip
pocket
a
slender
stone
and
began
phlegmatically
to
caress
the
blade
of
the
scythe
with
it
hay
that
stuff
not
goin
to
stop
growin
while
you
fool
around
got
to
do
things
right
explained
mr
barelli
gently
the
rhythmic
friction
of
stone
against
steel
prolonged
suspense
unbearably
all
kinds
of
speculation
crowded
my
mind
while
the
leisurely
performance
went
on
the
grass
was
growing
rapidly
faster
than
vegetation
had
ever
grown
before
could
it
grow
so
quickly
the
scythe
couldnt
keep
up
with
it
suppose
it
had
been
wheat
or
corn
planted
today
it
would
be
ready
to
harvest
next
week
fully
ripe
the
original
dream
of
miss
francis
would
pale
compared
with
the
reality
there
was
still
somewhere
somehow
a
fortune
in
the
metamorphizer
ready
at
last
mr
barelli
walked
delicately
across
the
stubble
as
if
it
were
a
substance
too
precious
to
be
trampled
brutally
again
he
measured
the
rippling
ascending
mass
with
his
eye
it
was
the
look
of
a
bridegroom
what
you
waitin
for
unheeding
he
scraped
bootwelt
semicircularly
on
the
sward
as
though
to
mark
a
stance
once
more
he
appraised
the
grass
crooked
his
knee
rested
his
hands
lightly
on
the
two
short
upraised
handholds
satisfied
at
length
with
his
preparations
he
finally
drew
the
scythe
back
with
a
sweeping
motion
of
both
arms
and
curved
it
forward
close
to
the
ground
it
embraced
a
sudden
island
lovingly
and
a
sheaf
of
grass
swooned
into
a
heap
i
was
reminded
of
old
woodcuts
in
a
history
of
the
french
revolution
the
bystanders
sighed
in
harmony
nothing
to
it
should
a
had
him
in
the
first
place
ca
beat
the
old
elbowgrease
no
sir
musclepower
do
it
every
time
guess
it
licked
now
all
right
all
right
mr
barelli
duplicated
his
sweep
and
another
sheaf
fell
another
and
another
one
of
the
oldest
human
rituals
remarked
miss
francis
swaying
her
body
in
time
with
the
farmer
an
act
of
devotion
to
ceres
but
all
this
husbandman
reaps
is
a
commentary
progress
i
pointed
out
now
they
have
machines
to
harvest
grain
all
uptodate
farmers
use
them
only
the
backward
ones
stick
to
primitive
tools
and
have
to
make
a
living
by
taking
on
odd
jobs
progress
she
repeated
looking
from
the
scythewielder
to
me
and
back
again
progress
weener
a
remarkable
conception
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
less
intense
spectators
began
to
move
off
not
to
be
sure
without
backward
glances
but
the
metronomic
swing
of
mr
barelli
blade
indicated
it
was
all
over
with
the
rank
grass
now
i
too
should
have
been
on
my
way
writing
off
the
metamorphizer
as
a
total
loss
and
considering
methods
for
making
a
new
and
more
profitable
connection
not
that
i
was
one
to
leave
a
sinking
ship
nor
had
i
lost
faith
in
the
potentialities
of
miss
francis
discovery
but
she
either
wasnt
smart
enough
to
modify
her
formula
or
else
but
there
really
wasnt
any
or
else
she
just
wasnt
smart
enough
to
make
the
metamorphizer
marketable
and
she
was
cheating
me
of
the
handsome
return
which
should
be
rightfully
mine
she
made
the
stuff
and
deceived
me
by
an
unscrupulously
worded
advertisement
now
no
longer
interested
she
asked
airily
if
further
effort
were
essential
who
wouldnt
be
indignant
and
to
cap
it
all
she
suddenly
ejaculated
ca
dawdle
around
here
all
day
and
after
snatching
up
a
handful
of
the
scythings
she
left
rolling
her
large
body
from
side
to
side
galloping
her
untidy
hair
up
and
down
over
her
neck
as
she
took
rapid
strides
evidently
the
attractions
of
her
messy
kitchen
were
more
to
her
taste
than
the
wholesome
air
of
outdoors
pottering
around
producing
another
mare
nest
and
eventually
i
suppose
getting
another
victim
but
i
couldnt
leave
so
cavalierly
every
leaf
stem
and
blade
of
the
cancerous
grass
held
me
in
somewhat
the
same
way
miss
intense
eyes
did
it
wasnt
an
aesthetic
or
morbid
attraction
its
basis
was
strictly
practical
if
it
could
have
been
controlled
if
only
the
growth
could
be
induced
on
a
modified
and
proper
scale
what
a
product
a
fury
of
frustration
rocked
my
customary
calm
the
stretch
and
retraction
of
the
mower
arms
the
swift
bright
curving
as
the
scythe
cut
deeper
fascinated
me
an
unscrupulous
man
just
as
a
whimsical
thought
might
go
about
in
the
night
inoculating
lawns
surreptitiously
and
appear
with
a
crew
next
day
to
offer
his
services
in
cutting
them
just
goes
to
show
how
easy
it
is
to
make
dishonest
speculations
but
of
course
such
things
do
pay
in
the
long
run
the
lush
area
was
being
reduced
but
perhaps
not
with
the
same
rapidity
as
at
first
when
mr
barelli
was
at
the
top
of
enthusiastic
if
the
adjective
was
applicable
vigor
oftener
and
oftener
and
oftener
he
paused
to
sharpen
his
implement
and
i
thought
the
cropped
shocks
were
becoming
smaller
and
smaller
as
the
movement
of
the
scythe
swept
the
guillotined
grass
backward
the
trailing
stolons
entangled
themselves
with
the
uncut
stand
pulling
the
sheaves
out
of
place
and
making
the
stacks
ragged
and
inadequate
looking
behind
me
a
cocky
voice
asked
what
cooking
around
here
chum
i
turned
round
to
a
young
man
thin
as
a
bamboo
pole
elegantly
tailored
who
yawned
to
advertise
gold
inlays
i
explained
while
he
looked
skeptical
bored
and
knowing
simultaneously
who
would
tha
flummox
bah
goom
he
inquired
ay
he
took
a
pack
of
playingcards
from
his
pocket
and
riffled
them
expertly
who
you
kidding
bud
he
translated
no
one
ask
anybody
here
if
this
wasnt
a
dead
lawn
yesterday
and
if
it
hasnt
grown
this
high
since
morning
he
yawned
again
and
proffered
me
the
deck
pick
any
card
he
suggested
to
avoid
rudeness
i
selected
one
he
put
the
pack
back
and
said
you
have
the
nine
of
diamonds
clever
eh
i
didnt
know
whether
it
was
or
not
he
accepted
the
pasteboard
from
me
and
said
peering
out
from
under
furry
black
eyebrows
if
i
brought
in
a
story
like
that
the
chief
would
fire
me
before
you
could
say
james
gordon
bennett
youre
a
reporter
acute
chap
newspaperman
name
of
gootes
jacson
gootes
not
wonder
i
thought
i
saw
an
answer
to
my
most
pressing
problem
one
has
to
stoop
occasionally
to
methods
which
if
they
didnt
lead
to
important
ends
might
almost
be
termed
petty
but
afterall
there
was
no
reason
mr
jacson
gootes
shouldnt
buy
me
a
dinner
in
return
for
information
valuable
to
him
let
get
away
from
here
i
suggested
he
fished
out
a
coin
showed
it
to
me
waved
his
arm
in
the
air
and
opened
an
empty
palm
for
my
inspection
ah
sho
would
like
to
cunnel
but
ahve
got
to
covah
thisyeah
even
if
it
out
of
this
mizzble
i
sure
i
can
give
you
details
to
bring
it
down
to
earth
i
told
him
make
it
a
story
your
editor
will
be
glad
to
have
he
pressed
tobacco
into
a
slender
pipe
as
emaciated
as
himself
you
do
know
w
if
he
got
a
beat
on
the
story
of
creation
he
be
sore
as
hell
because
god
wanted
a
byline
he
evidently
enjoyed
his
own
quip
for
he
repeated
several
times
in
different
accents
god
wanted
a
byline
he
puffed
a
matchflame
and
surveyed
the
field
of
mr
barelli
effort
hardworkin
feller
what
guess
i
better
have
a
chat
with
the
bounder
probably
closest
to
the
dashed
thing
mr
gootes
i
said
impressively
i
am
the
man
who
applied
the
inoculator
to
this
grass
now
shall
we
get
out
of
here
so
you
can
listen
to
my
story
sonabeesh
thees
gona
be
good
lead
away
amigo
i
prepare
both
ears
to
leesten
i
drew
him
toward
hollywood
boulevard
and
into
a
restaurant
i
calculated
might
not
be
too
expensive
for
his
generosity
besides
he
probably
had
an
expenseaccount
we
put
a
porcelaintopped
table
between
us
and
he
commanded
give
down
obediently
i
went
over
all
the
happenings
of
yesterday
omitting
only
miss
francis
name
and
the
revealing
wording
of
the
ad
gootes
surveyed
me
interestedly
you
certainly
started
something
here
acne
psoriasis
humor
like
his
was
beneath
offense
my
name
albert
weener
mine
mustard
he
produced
a
plastic
cup
and
rapidly
extracted
from
it
a
series
of
others
in
diminishing
sizes
i
wouldnt
have
thought
it
to
look
at
you
the
dirty
deed
i
mean
not
the
exzemical
hotdog
o
k
mister
weener
who
this
scientific
magnate
whyre
you
holding
him
out
on
me
scientists
do
like
to
be
disturbed
in
their
researches
i
temporized
no
more
does
a
man
in
a
whorehouse
he
retorted
vulgarly
story
no
good
without
him
that
was
what
i
thought
and
i
afraid
my
satisfaction
appeared
on
my
face
now
leely
man
no
try
a
hold
up
da
press
whatsa
matter
you
aready

maybe
you
better
repeat
the
order
you
know
in
these
cheap
places
they
do
like
to
have
you
sit
around
and
talk
without
spending
money
money
eh
laddie
i
nae
a
millionaire
he
balanced
a
full
glass
of
water
thoughtfully
upon
a
knifeblade
looking
around
for
applause
when
it
was
not
forthcoming
he
meekly
followed
my
suggestion
listen
gootes
i
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
sandwich
and
sipped
a
little
beer
i
want
to
help
you
get
your
story
he
waved
his
hand
and
pulled
a
handkerchief
out
of
his
ear
the
point
is
i
commenced
sopping
a
piece
of
bread
in
the
thick
gravy
if
i
were
to
betray
the
confidence
involved
i
couldnt
hope
to
continue
my
connection
and
i
lose
my
chances
to
benefit
from
this
remarkable
discovery
balls
exclaimed
gootes
forget
the
spiel
i
not
a
prospect
for
your
lawn
tonic
i
disregarded
the
interruption
i
not
a
mercenary
man
and
i
believe
in
enlightening
the
public
to
the
fullest
extent
compatible
with
decency
i
willing
to
make
a
sacrifice
for
the
general
good
yet
i
live
i
know
i
know
how
much
it
seems
to
me
fifty
dollars
would
be
little
enough
fifty
potatoes
he
went
through
an
elaborate
pantomime
of
shock
horror
indignation
grotesque
dismay
and
a
dozen
other
assorted
emotions
little
man
youre
fruitcake
sure
w
r
wouldnt
part
with
half
a
c
for
a
tipoff
on
the
secondcoming
no
brother
you
rang
the
wrong
bell
five
i
might
get
you
but
no
more
i
replied
firmly
i
was
not
in
need
of
charity
ignoring
his
pointed
look
at
the
remains
on
my
plate
and
this
was
strictly
a
business
proposition
payment
for
value
received
after
some
bargaining
he
finally
agreed
to
phone
his
managingeditor
and
propose
i
come
clean
for
twenty
dollars
while
he
was
on
this
errand
i
added
pie
and
coffee
to
the
check
it
is
well
to
be
provident
and
i
paid
for
my
meal
in
more
than
money
jacson
gootes
came
limply
from
the
phonebooth
his
bumptiousness
gone
no
soap
he
shook
his
head
dejectedly
old
man
said
only
pity
for
the
lower
mammals
prevented
him
from
letting
me
go
to
work
for
hearst
right
away
sorry
his
nerves
appeared
quite
shattered
capable
of
restoration
only
by
old
grandad
after
tossing
down
a
couple
of
bourbons
he
seemed
a
little
recovered
but
hardly
quite
well
enough
to
use
an
accent
or
perform
a
trick
i
sorry
also
i
said
since
we
can
be
of
no
further
use
to
each
other
do
take
a
powder
chum
he
urged
plaintively
what
about
a
last
gander
at
the
weed
together
as
we
walked
back
i
reflected
that
at
any
rate
i
was
saved
from
submitting
miss
francis
to
vulgar
publicity
everything
is
for
the
best
ive
seen
a
hundred
instances
to
prove
it
perhaps
who
knew
something
might
yet
happen
to
make
it
possible
for
me
to
profit
by
the
freak
growth
needs
a
transfusion
remarked
gootes
as
we
stood
on
the
sidewalk
before
it
indeed
it
was
anemically
green
uneven
hacked
and
ragged
shorn
of
its
emerald
beauty
a
high
fog
filtered
the
late
afternoon
light
to
show
mr
barelli
task
accomplished
and
the
curious
watchers
gone
it
was
no
smoothly
clipped
carpet
yet
it
was
no
longer
a
freakish
exotic
thing
rather
forlorn
it
looked
and
crippled
paleface
pay
out
much
wampum
to
get
um
cut
every
day
oh
it
probably
wo
take
long
till
the
strength
is
exhausted
says
you
well
ive
got
half
a
story
cheerio
i
sighed
if
only
miss
francis
could
control
it
a
fortune
i
walked
home
trying
to
figure
out
what
i
was
going
to
do
tomorrow
i
thought
i
was
prepared
for
anything
after
the
shocks
of
the
day
before
i
know
i
was
prepared
for
nothing
at
all
to
find
the
grass
as
i
left
it
or
even
reverted
to
its
original
decay
indeed
i
was
not
too
sure
that
my
memory
was
completely
accurate
that
the
thing
had
happened
so
fantastically
but
the
devilgrass
had
outdone
itself
and
made
my
anticipations
foolish
it
waved
a
green
crest
higher
than
the
crowd
a
crowd
three
times
the
size
of
yesterday
and
increasing
rapidly
all
the
scars
inflicted
on
it
the
indignities
of
scythe
and
mower
were
covered
by
a
new
and
even
more
prodigious
stand
which
made
all
its
former
growth
appear
puny
bold
and
insolent
it
had
repaired
the
hackedout
areas
and
risen
to
such
a
height
that
except
for
a
narrow
strip
at
the
top
all
the
windows
of
the
dinkman
house
were
smothered
of
the
garage
only
the
roof
islanded
and
bewildered
was
visible
apparently
resting
on
a
solid
foundation
of
devilgrass
it
sprawled
kittenishly
its
deceptive
softness
faintly
suggesting
fur
at
once
playful
and
destructive
my
optimism
of
the
night
before
was
dashed
this
voracious
growth
wasnt
going
to
dwindle
away
of
itself
it
would
have
to
be
killed
rooted
out
now
the
dinkman
lawn
wasnt
continuous
with
its
neighbors
but
until
now
had
been
set
off
by
chesthigh
hedges
the
day
before
these
had
contained
and
defined
the
growth
but
overwhelming
them
in
the
night
the
grass
had
swept
across
and
invaded
the
neat
civilized
plots
behind
blurring
sharply
cut
edges
curiously
investigating
flowerbeds
barbarously
strangling
shapely
bushes
but
these
werent
the
ravages
which
upset
me
it
was
reasonable
if
not
entirely
comfortable
to
see
shrubbery
plants
and
blossoms
swallowed
up
work
of
men
hands
they
may
be
but
they
bear
the
imprimatur
of
nature
the
cement
sidewalk
however
was
pure
artifice
stamped
with
the
trademark
of
man
indignity
and
defeat
were
symbolized
by
its
overrunning
it
was
an
arrogant
defiance
an
outrageous
challenge
offered
to
every
man
happening
by
but
the
grass
was
not
satisfied
with
this
irreverence
it
was
already
making
demands
on
curbing
and
gutter
junior
youve
got
a
story
now
w
r
fired
three
copyboys
and
a
proofreader
he
was
so
mad
at
himself
here
jacson
gootes
made
a
pass
in
the
air
simulated
astonishment
at
the
twentydollar
bill
which
appeared
miraculously
between
his
fingers
and
put
it
in
my
hand
thank
you
i
replied
coolly
just
what
is
this
for
faith
me
boy
such
innocence
ive
never
seen
since
i
left
the
old
sod
tis
but
a
little
token
of
esteem
from
himself
to
repay
you
for
the
trouble
of
leading
me
to
your
scientist
your
frankenstein
your
burbank
lead
on
my
boy
and
make
it
snappy
brother
he
added
because
ive
got
to
be
back
here
for
the
rescue
rescue
yeah
people
in
the
house
he
consulted
a
scrap
of
paper
pinkman
dinkman
dinkman
yeah
thanks
no
idea
how
sensitive
people
are
when
you
get
their
names
wrong
dinkmans
phoned
the
firedepartment
ca
get
out
rescue
any
minute
got
to
cover
that
imperative
trapped
in
home
by
freak
lawn
and
nail
down
your
scientist
at
the
same
time
i
was
very
anxious
myself
to
see
what
would
happen
here
so
i
suggested
since
i
could
take
him
to
the
discoverer
of
the
metamorphizer
any
time
that
we
better
stay
and
get
the
dinkman
story
first
with
overenthusiastic
praise
of
my
acuteness
he
agreed
and
began
practicing
his
sleightofhand
tricks
to
the
great
pleasure
of
some
children
the
same
ones
i
suspect
who
had
plagued
me
when
i
was
spraying
the
lawn
his
performance
was
terminated
by
the
rapidly
approaching
firesiren
the
crowd
seemed
of
several
minds
about
the
purpose
of
the
red
truck
squealing
around
the
corner
to
a
stop
some
like
gootes
had
heard
the
dinkmans
were
indeed
trapped
in
the
house
others
declared
the
firemen
had
come
to
cut
away
the
grass
onceandforall
still
others
held
the
loud
opinion
that
the
swift
growth
had
generated
a
spontaneous
combustion
but
having
made
their
abrupt
halt
the
truck
or
rather
the
firemen
on
it
anticlimactically
did
nothing
at
all
helmeted
and
accoutered
ready
for
instant
action
they
relaxed
contentedly
against
the
engine
oblivious
of
grass
bystanders
or
presumable
emergency
gootes
strolled
over
to
inquire
the
cause
of
their
indolence
waiting
for
the
chief
he
was
informed
thereupon
he
borrowed
a
helmet
possibly
on
the
strength
of
his
presscard
and
proceeded
to
pull
from
it
such
a
variety
of
objects
that
he
received
the
final
accolade
from
several
of
his
audience
when
they
told
him
admiringly
he
ought
to
be
on
the
stage
the
bystanders
were
not
seduced
by
this
entertainment
into
approval
of
the
firemen
idleness
and
inquired
sarcastically
why
they
had
left
their
cots
behind
or
if
they
thought
they
were
still
on
wpa
the
men
remained
impervious
until
the
chief
jumped
out
of
his
red
roadster
and
surveyed
the
scene
napoleonically
thought
somebody
was
pulling
a
rib
he
explained
to
no
one
in
particular
all
right
boys
there
folks
in
that
house
let
get
them
out
carrying
a
ladder
the
men
plunged
toward
the
house
their
boots
trod
the
sprawling
runners
heavily
spurning
and
crushing
them
carelessly
the
grass
responded
by
flowing
back
like
water
sloshing
over
ankles
and
lapping
at
calves
thoroughly
entangling
and
impeding
progress
panting
and
struggling
the
firemen
penetrated
only
a
short
way
into
the
mass
before
they
were
slowed
almost
to
a
standstill
from
the
sidelines
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
wrestling
with
an
invisible
octopus
feet
were
lifted
high
but
never
free
of
the
twining
vegetation
the
ladder
was
pulled
angrily
forward
but
the
clutch
of
the
grass
upon
it
became
firmer
with
every
tug
at
length
they
were
halted
although
their
efforts
still
gave
an
appearance
of
advance
thrashing
and
wrenching
they
urged
themselves
and
the
now
burdensome
ladder
against
the
invincible
wall
the
only
result
was
to
give
the
illusion
they
were
burying
themselves
in
the
clutching
tentacles
exertions
dwindled
the
struggle
grew
less
intense
then
they
retreated
fighting
their
way
out
of
the
enveloping
mass
in
a
panic
of
desperation
abandoning
the
ladder
the
chief
surveyed
them
with
less
than
approbation
cut
your
way
in
he
ordered
you
guys
think
those
axes
are
only
to
bust
up
furniture
with
obediently
wedges
of
bright
steel
flashed
against
the
green
wall
impatiently
i
await
the
rescue
of
fair
dinkmans
from
this
enchanted
keep
murmured
gootes
vainly
trying
to
balance
his
pipe
on
the
back
of
his
hand
it
looked
as
though
he
would
have
to
contain
his
impatience
for
some
time
the
firemen
slashed
unenthusiastically
at
the
grass
which
gave
way
only
grudgingly
and
by
inches
halfanhour
later
they
triumphantly
dragged
out
the
abandoned
ladder
stuff
like
rubber
bounds
back
instead
of
cutting
yeah
and
in
the
meantime
those
people
been
telephoning
again
want
to
know
what
the
delay
is
want
to
know
what
they
pay
taxes
for
threaten
to
sue
the
city
let
sue
long
as
theyre
in
there
they
ca
collect
funny
as
a
flat
tire
get
going
goldbrick
another
firetruck
rolled
up
and
there
was
much
kidding
back
and
forth
between
the
two
crews
this
was
clearly
no
situation
in
which
lives
or
property
were
at
stake
it
was
rather
in
line
with
assisting
distraught
cats
down
from
tops
of
telephonepoles
or
persuading
selfimmolated
children
to
unlock
the
bathroom
door
and
let
mommy
in
an
amusing
interval
in
a
tense
day
perhaps
those
manning
the
second
truck
were
more
naturally
ingenious
possibly
the
original
workers
sought
more
diverting
labor
at
any
rate
the
futile
chopping
was
abandoned
instead
several
long
ladders
were
hooked
together
and
the
synthesis
lowered
from
the
curb
to
the
edge
of
dinkman
roof
it
seemed
remarkably
fragile
but
it
reached
and
the
watchers
murmured
approval
no
longer
beset
by
novelty
the
men
took
easily
to
the
swaying
sagging
bridge
they
passed
over
the
baffled
grass
the
leader
carrying
another
short
ladder
which
he
hung
from
the
roof
stabbing
its
lower
rungs
down
into
the
matted
verdure
below
the
crossing
was
made
with
such
insouciance
the
wonder
was
they
hadnt
done
it
at
first
instead
of
wasting
time
on
other
expedients
the
firemen
went
down
the
vertical
ladder
and
forced
an
entrance
into
the
choked
windows
mrs
dinkman
came
out
first
helped
by
two
of
them
she
kept
pinching
her
glasses
into
place
with
one
hand
and
pulling
her
skirt
modestly
close
with
the
other
activities
leaving
her
very
little
to
grasp
the
ladder
with
the
firemen
seemed
quite
accustomed
to
this
sort
of
irrationality
and
paying
no
heed
to
the
rush
of
words
inaudible
to
us
on
the
street
bursting
from
her
they
coaxed
her
expertly
up
onto
the
roof
here
she
stood
statuesquely
outlined
against
the
bright
sky
berating
her
succorers
until
mr
dinkman
rounded
bald
and
calm
joined
her
at
first
mrs
dinkman
refused
to
try
the
bridge
to
the
street
but
after
some
urging
which
was
conveyed
to
us
by
the
gestures
of
the
firemen
she
ventured
gingerly
on
the
trembling
ladders
only
to
draw
back
quickly
one
of
the
firemen
demonstrated
the
ease
and
simplicity
of
the
journey
but
it
was
vain
mrs
dinkman
was
carried
across
gallantly
in
traditional
movie
style
with
mr
dinkman
and
the
crew
following
sedately
behind
a
crime
mrs
dinkman
was
saying
when
she
came
within
earshot
a
crime
malicious
mischief
ought
to
be
locked
up
for
life
do
upset
yourself
my
dear
urged
mr
dinkman
it
very
distressing
but
afterall
it
might
be
worse
adam
dinkman
has
misfortune
completely
unhinged
your
mind
money
thrown
in
the
gutter
imposed
on
by
oily
rascals
our
house
swallowed
up
by
this
this
unnatural
stuff
and
the
final
humiliation
of
being
pulled
out
of
our
own
home
in
front
of
a
gawking
crowd
she
turned
around
and
shouted
shoo
shoo
why
do
you
go
home
and
then
to
mr
dinkman
again
indeed
i
like
to
know
what
could
be
worse
well
now
began
mr
dinkman
but
i
didnt
hear
the
rest
for
i
was
afraid
by
rascals
mrs
dinkman
referred
quite
unjustly
to
me
and
i
thought
the
time
opportune
to
remind
gootes
he
hadnt
yet
completed
his
assignment
right
he
agreed
suddenly
assuming
the
abrupt
accents
of
an
improbable
englishman
oh
very
right
old
chap
let
toddle
along
and
see
what
fu
manchu
has
to
say
for
himself
first
off
though
i
shall
have
to
phone
in
to
fleet
street
i
mean
to
w
fine
you
can
ask
him
at
the
same
time
to
authorize
you
to
give
me
the
other
thirty
gootes
lost
his
british
speech
instantly
what
other
thirty
bum
why
the
balance
of
the
fifty
for
an
introduction
to
mi
to
the
maker
of
the
metamorphizer
to
compensate
me
you
know
for
my
loss
of
revenue
weener
you
have
all
the
earmarks
of
a
castiron
moocher
let
me
tell
you
suh
such
methods
are
unbecoming
they
suggest
damyankee
push
and
blackmail
remember
reconstruction
and
white
supremacy
suh
if
i
were
hypersensitive
to
the
silly
things
people
say
i
should
have
given
up
selling
long
before
i
pretended
not
to
hear
him
we
walked
into
a
drugstore
and
he
dropped
a
nickel
into
a
payphone
hunching
the
receiver
between
ear
and
shoulder
fifty
your
last
word
he
asked
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
i
nodded
hello
gootes
hya
beautiful
syphilis
all
cleared
up
now
now
baby
well
if
youre
going
to
be
formal
gim
me
w
he
turned
to
me
and
leered
while
he
waited
chief
gootes
got
the
dinkman
story
you
know
freak
growth
swallows
hollywood
mansion
yeah
yeah
i
know
but
chief
this
was
what
i
wanted
you
for
on
the
followup
i
have
the
fellow
who
put
the
stuff
on
the
grass
yeah
sure
i
did
yeah
and
the
sonofabitch
wants
to
hold
us
up
for
another
thirty
or
else
he
wo
sing
yeah
yeah
i
know
but
i
ca
chief
i
havent
got
a
lead
i
do
know
chief
not
much
of
a
one
i
guess
wait
a
minute
he
turned
to
me
listen
little
man
mr
le
ffaçasé
he
pronounced
it
and
he
pronounced
it
with
awe
i
too
was
properly
solemn
for
i
hadnt
realized
before
to
whom
he
referred
when
he
talked
so
lightly
of
w
i
knew
as
what
newspaper
reader
didnt
of
william
rufus
le
ffaçasé
the
last
of
the
great
editors
but
i
hadnt
connected
him
with
the
mr
le
ffaçasé
will
shoot
you
another
sawbuck
and
no
more
what
the
deal
now
the
famous
editor
reputation
was
such
that
you
didnt
tell
him
to
go
to
the
devil
even
through
the
medium
of
an
agent
it
would
have
been
like
writing
your
name
on
the
lincoln
memorial
it
was
reluctantly
therefore
that
i
shook
my
head
i
sorry
mr
gootes
i
apologized
i
certainly
like
to
oblige
he
cut
me
off
with
a
waving
hand
and
turned
cheerfully
back
to
the
telephone
no
soap
chief
o
o
all
right
put
the
rewrite
man
on
and
for
the
next
ten
minutes
he
went
over
the
events
at
the
dinkmans
carefully
spelling
out
all
names
including
the
napoleonic
firechief
i
began
to
suspect
gootes
wasnt
so
inefficient
a
reporter
as
he
appeared
the
story
given
in
he
hung
up
and
turned
to
me
well
so
long
little
man
been
nice
knowing
you
but
what
about
meeting
the
discoverer
of
the
metamorphizer
oh
that
well
w
r
thinks
we
do
need
him
anymore
not
enough
in
that
angle
i
suspected
he
was
bluffing
still
it
was
possible
he
wasnt
in
such
a
delicate
situation
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
but
bluff
in
turn
if
you
are
a
good
salesman
i
always
say
you
must
have
psychology
at
your
fingertips
very
well
mr
gootes
perhaps
i
shall
see
you
again
sometime
i
was
immediately
confronted
by
a
frenchman
affable
volatile
affectionate
ah
cher
ami
do
not
leave
me
with
the
abruptness
you
desolate
mon
coeur
alors
return
to
me
the
twenty
dollars
but
mr
gootes
none
of
it
bud
he
whisked
the
cards
out
and
showed
them
to
me
the
ace
of
spades
ghoulishly
visible
its
ominousness
tempered
only
by
the
word
bicycle
printed
across
it
do
hold
out
on
your
uncle
jacson
or
i
might
have
the
boys
take
you
for
a
little
trip
a
block
of
concrete
tastefully
inscribed
weener
ought
to
make
an
amusing
base
for
a
birdbath
say
listen
gootes
i
was
firm
i
reasonably
certain
youve
been
authorized
to
advance
me
the
other
thirty
but
i
hope
we
both
sensible
people
and
i
be
glad
to
sign
a
receipt
for
the
full
amount
if
youll
let
me
have
twentyfive
albert
youre
a
fine
fellow
a
prince
on
a
page
from
his
notebook
he
wrote
jacson
gootes
and
i
signed
it
he
handed
me
another
twentydollarbill
and
put
his
wallet
away
charge
the
other
five
to
agent
fees
he
suggested
lead
us
to
your
steinmetz
you
just
ca
expect
everyone
to
have
the
same
standards
of
probity
so
philosophically
i
pocketed
my
loss
and
gains
together
life
is
full
of
ups
and
downs
and
take
the
bad
with
the
good
gootes
was
in
high
spirits
after
his
piece
of
chicanery
and
as
we
went
down
the
street
he
practiced
quite
unsuccessfully
a
series
of
ventriloquial
exercises
the
appearance
of
the
apartmenthouse
drew
the
comment
from
him
that
it
was
a
good
thing
for
their
collective
bloodpressures
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
all
year
club
didnt
know
such
things
existed
in
the
heart
of
hollywood
it
no
better
than
i
live
in
myself
he
added
he
whistled
at
the
dismal
livingroom
and
raised
his
eyebrows
at
the
kitchen
before
i
could
mutter
an
introduction
miss
francis
growled
without
turning
around
if
youve
come
about
the
icebox
zounds
exclaimed
gootes
a
female
linnaeus
shades
of
dorothy
dix
i
do
know
who
you
are
young
man
but
youre
extremely
impudent
to
come
tramping
into
my
kitchen
adding
nothing
to
the
sum
of
knowledge
but
a
confirmation
of
my
sex
which
would
be
plain
to
any
mammal
if
youve
nein
fräulein
doktor
said
gootes
hastily
about
z
kelvinators
i
know
nossing
i
represent
fräulein

z
zeitung
miss
francis
pierced
his
turgid
explanation
with
a
sharp
spate
of
words
in
what
i
took
to
be
german
gootes
answered
with
difficult
slowness
but
he
fumbled
and
halted
before
long
and
abandoning
the
central
european
became
again
the
southern
gentleman
i
quite
understand
mam
how
any
delicately
reared
gentlewoman
would
resent
having
her
privacy
intruded
upon
by
rude
agents
of
the
yellow
press
but
consider
mam
we
live
in
a
progressive
age
and
having
made
a
great
contribution
to
science
you
can
hardly
escape
the
fame
rightfully
yours
you
are
a
public
figure
now
and
must
stand
in
the
light
would
it
not
be
preferable
mam
to
talk
as
lady
to
gentleman
i
am
related
to
the
taliaferros
of
ruffin
county
on
the
distaff
side
than
to
be
badgered
by
some
hack
journalist
miss
francis
squatted
ungracefully
on
her
heels
and
looked
up
from
the
flowerpot
she
had
been
engaged
with
i
havent
any
objection
to
publicity
hack
or
otherwise
she
said
mildly
i
am
merely
impressed
again
by
the
invulnerability
of
newspapers
to
thousands
of
important
discoveries
and
inventions
newsworthy
to
science
as
you
call
them
in
your
bland
ignorance
of
semantics
in
contrast
to
their
acute
almost
painful
sensitivity
to
any
mischance
gootes
unjointing
disproportioned
length
carelessly
against
the
sink
to
the
peril
of
several
jars
of
specimens
didnt
reply
instead
he
fluttered
his
arms
and
produced
a
halfdollar
apparently
from
miss
francis
hair
which
after
exhibiting
he
prudently
pocketed
tell
me
dr
francis
miss
show
me
how
you
did
that
trick
in
a
minute
miss
francis
it
a
honey
isnt
it
paid
fourbits
to
a
funhouse
in
utica
new
york
for
it
tell
me
how
did
you
come
to
make
your
great
discovery
i
was
born
i
went
to
school
i
read
books
i
reached
maturity
i
looked
through
a
microscope
yes
prodded
gootes
that
all
lassie
urged
gootes
underlining
the
honey
of
his
voice
with
a
tantalizing
glimpse
of
a
rapidfire
snatching
of
three
colored
handkerchiefs
out
of
the
air
tis
no
sensible
course
ye
follow
think
gurrl
what
the
press
can
do
to
a
recalcitrant
lass
like
yoursel
ye
wouldna
like
it
if
tomorrow
paper
branded
you
and
i
quote
unsexed
harpy
a
traitor
to
mankind
a
heartless
soulless
oh
shut
up
what
do
you
want
to
know
first
said
gootes
briskly
what
is
this
stuff
the
metamorphizer
he
nodded
you
want
the
chemical
formula
wouldnt
do
me
or
my
readers
the
least
bit
of
good
and
you
wouldnt
give
it
to
me
if
i
asked
why
should
you
no
enlighten
me
in
english
it
is
a
compound
on
the
order
of
colchicine
acting
through
the
somaplasm
of
the
plant
it
is
apparently
effective
only
on
the
family
gramineae
producing
a
constitutional
metabolic
change
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
as
yet
whether
this
change
is
transmissible
through
seed
to
offspring
hay
wait
a
minute
a
constitutional
metabolic
change
how
do
you
spell
metabolic
never
mind
the
proofreaders
catch
it
what
constitutional
change
are
you
a
botanist
young
man
gootes
shook
his
head
an
agrostologist
even
an
agronomist
then
you
ca
have
the
slightest
idea
what
i
talking
about
maybe
not
retorted
gootes
but
one
of
my
readers
might
just
give
me
a
rough
idea
plants
absorb
certain
minerals
in
suspension
that
is
they
absorb
some
and
reject
others
the
metamorphizer
seems
to
give
them
the
ability
to
break
down
even
the
most
stable
compound
select
what
they
need
and
also
fix
the
inert
nitrogen
of
the
air
to
nourish
themselves
repeated
gootes
writing
rapidly
o
if
i
get
you
which
is
doubtful
so
far
it
sounds
just
like
a
good
new
fertilizer
really
i
tried
to
make
myself
clear
now
do
get
sore
professor
just
give
out
on
what
made
the
grass
go
wild
i
can
only
hazard
a
guess
as
i
told
weener
if
you
create
a
capacity
you
engender
an
appetite
i
imagine
that
patch
of
just
couldnt
stop
absorbing
once
it
had
been
inoculated
aha
like
giving
a
man
a
taste
for
bourbon
if
it
pleases
you
to
put
it
that
way
o
o
now
let
have
an
idea
how
this
growth
can
be
stopped
theoretical
you
know
as
far
as
i
know
said
miss
francis
it
can
not
be
stopped
two
of
a
but
it
got
to
be
stopped
exclaimed
gootes
miss
francis
turned
silently
back
to
her
flowerpot
as
though
forgotten
us
gootes
coursed
the
kitchenfloor
like
a
puzzled
yet
anxious
hound
damn
it
it
got
to
be
stopped
he
halfway
extracted
his
pack
of
cards
then
hastily
withdrew
his
hand
as
though
guarding
the
gravity
otherwise
why
otherwise
itll
swallow
the
house
he
decided
on
the
cards
afterall
and
balanced
four
of
them
edgewise
on
the
back
of
his
hand
miss
francis
immediately
abandoned
the
flowerpot
to
stare
childishly
at
the
feat
in
fact
if
what
you
say
is
true
it
will
literally
swallow
up
the
house
digest
it
convert
it
into
devilgrass
what
i
say
is
true
how
much
elementary
physics
is
involved
in
that
trick
but
that
terrible
protested
gootes
he
regarded
a
bowl
of
algae
as
if
about
to
make
it
disappear
mentally
i
agreed
one
of
the
greatest
potential
moneymakers
of
the
age
lost
and
valueless
yes
she
agreed
it
is
terrible
terrible
as
the
starvation
in
a
hive
when
the
apiarist
takes
out
the
winter
honey
terrible
as
the
daily
business
in
an
abattoir
terrible
as
the
appetite
of
grown
fish
at
spawning
time
poo
fate
kismet
nature
ah
you
are
unconcerned
with
catastrophes
which
do
affect
man
local
man
substituted
gootes
los
angeles
man
stiffs
in
constantinople
are
strictly
ap
stuff
it
seems
to
me
i
broke
in
that
you
are
both
assuming
too
much
i
do
know
of
anything
that
calls
for
the
word
catastrophe
i
sure
sorry
if
the
dinkmans
house
is
swallowed
up
as
gootes
suggests
but
it
hasnt
been
and
i
sure
the
possibility
is
exaggerated
the
authorities
will
do
something
or
the
grass
will
stop
growing
i
do
see
any
point
in
looking
at
the
blackest
side
of
things
gootes
opened
his
mouth
in
pretended
astonishment
wal
i
swan
boy
a
philosopher
you
are
not
particularly
concerned
weener
i
do
know
any
reason
why
i
should
be
i
retorted
i
sold
your
product
in
good
faith
and
i
am
not
responsible
oh
blind
blind
do
you
imagine
one
man
can
suffer
and
you
not
suffer
is
your
name
simeon
stylites
do
you
think
for
an
instant
what
happens
to
any
man
doesnt
happen
to
everyman
are
you
not
your
keeper
she
twisted
her
hands
together
not
responsible
why
you
are
responsible
for
every
brutality
execution
meanness
and
calamity
in
the
world
today
i
had
often
heard
that
the
borderline
between
profundity
and
insanity
was
thin
and
inexact
and
it
was
now
clear
on
which
side
she
stood
i
looked
at
gootes
to
see
how
he
was
taking
her
hysterical
outburst
but
he
had
found
a
batch
of
empty
testtubes
which
he
was
building
into
a
perilously
swaying
structure
of
course
of
course
i
agreed
soothingly
backing
away
youre
quite
right
she
walked
the
floor
as
if
her
awkward
body
were
a
burden
is
the
instant
response
to
an
obvious
truth
platitude
even
always
a
diagnosis
of
lunacy
i
state
a
thought
so
old
no
one
knows
who
first
expressed
it
and
a
hearer
feels
bound
to
choose
between
offense
to
himself
and
contempt
for
the
speaker
believe
me
weener
i
was
offering
no
exclusive
indictment
i
too
am
guilty
infinitely
culpable
even
if
i
had
devoted
my
life
to
pure
science
perhaps
even
more
certainly
then
patterning
myself
on
a
medieval
monastic
faithful
to
vows
of
poverty
and
singleness
of
purpose
even
if
i
had
not
for
an
apparently
laudable
end
betrayed
my
efforts
to
a
base
greed
even
if
i
had
never
picked
for
a
moment
use
such
an
unworthy
do
not
be
insulted
again
weener
unworthiness
is
a
fact
insofar
as
there
are
any
facts
at
all
such
an
unworthy
tool
as
yourself
even
if
i
had
never
compounded
the
metamorphizer
even
if
i
had
been
a
biologist
or
an
astronomer
even
then
i
should
be
guilty
of
ruining
the
dinkmans
and
making
them
homeless
just
as
you
are
guilty
and
the
reporter
here
is
guilty
and
the
garbageman
is
guilty
and
the
pastor
in
his
pulpit
is
guilty
guilty
exclaimed
gootes
suddenly
guilty
what
kind
of
a
lousy
newspaperman
am
i
worrying
about
guilt
and
solutions
in
the
face
of
impending
calamity
instead
of
serving
it
redhot
to
a
palpitating
public
guilty
hell
i
ought
to
be
fired
or
anyway
shot
where
the
phone
i
manage
a
minimum
of
privacy
in
spite
of
inquiring
reporters
and
unemployed
canvassers
i
have
no
telephone
hokay
hole
everythings
i
return
immediate
i
followed
him
for
i
had
no
desire
to
be
left
alone
with
someone
who
might
prove
dangerous
but
his
long
legs
took
him
quickly
out
of
sight
before
i
could
catch
him
even
by
running
and
so
i
fell
into
a
more
sedate
pace
all
miss
francis
metaphysical
talk
was
beyond
me
but
what
little
i
could
make
of
it
was
pure
nonsense
guilty
why
i
had
never
done
anything
illegal
in
my
life
unless
taking
a
glass
of
beer
in
dry
territory
be
so
accounted
all
this
talk
about
guilt
suggested
some
sort
of
inverted
delusions
of
persecution
how
sad
it
was
the
eccentricity
of
genius
so
often
turned
its
possessors
into
cranks
i
was
thankful
to
be
of
mere
normal
intelligence
but
i
wasted
no
more
thought
on
her
putting
the
whole
episode
of
the
metamorphizer
behind
me
for
i
now
had
some
liquid
capital
it
was
true
it
didnt
amount
to
much
but
it
existed
crinkled
in
my
pocket
and
i
was
sure
with
my
experience
and
native
ability
i
could
turn
the
forty
dollars
into
a
much
larger
sum
but
a
resolve
to
forget
the
metamorphizer
didnt
enable
me
to
escape
mrs
dinkman
lawn
walking
down
hollywood
boulevard
formulating
rejecting
and
reshaping
plans
for
my
future
i
passed
a
radioshop
and
from
a
loudspeaker
hung
over
the
door
with
the
evident
purpose
of
inducing
suggestible
pedestrians
to
rush
in
and
purchase
sets
the
latest
report
of
the
devilgrass
advance
was
blared
out
at
me
station
kpar
the
voice
of
edendale
reaching
you
from
a
portable
transmitter
located
in
the
street
in
front
of
what
was
formerly
the
residence
of
mr
and
mrs
dinkman
i
guess
youve
all
heard
the
story
of
how
their
lawn
was
allegedly
sprinkled
with
some
chemical
which
made
the
grass
run
wild
i
do
know
anything
about
that
but
i
want
to
tell
you
this
grass
is
certainly
running
wild
it
must
be
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
high
think
of
that
folks
nearly
as
high
as
three
men
standing
on
each
other
shoulders
it
covered
the
roof
halfway
to
the
peak
and
choking
the
windows
and
doorways
of
the
houses
on
either
side
it
all
over
the
sidewalk
looks
like
an
enormous
green
woolly
rug
no
not
quite
right
anyway
it
all
over
the
sidewalk
and
it
would
be
right
out
here
in
the
street
where
i
talking
to
you
from
if
the
firedepartment
wasnt
on
the
job
constantly
chopping
off
the
creeping
ends
as
they
come
over
the
curb
i
want
to
tell
you
folks
it
a
frightening
sight
to
see
grass
the
same
kind
of
grass
growing
in
your
backyard
or
mine
magnified
or
maybe
i
mean
multiplied
a
hundred
times
or
maybe
more
and
coming
at
you
as
if
it
was
an
enemy
only
the
cold
steel
of
the
fireman
ax
saving
you
from
it
while
we
waiting
for
some
action
folks
well
not
exactly
that
the
grass
is
giving
us
plenty
of
action
all
right
i
try
to
bring
you
some
impressions
of
the
people
in
the
street
literally
in
the
street
because
the
sidewalk
is
covered
with
grass
pardon
me
sir
would
you
like
to
say
a
few
words

the
unseen
audience

this
phenomenon

by
the
sight
of
this
riot
of
vegetation

into
the
microphone

whole
crew

weedburners

and

this
thing
under
control
the
men

have
tanks
of
oil
or
kerosene
on
their
backs

minute

but
this
gentleman
doesnt
know
exactly

long
hoses
with
wide
nozzles
at
the
end
something
like
vacuumcleaners
well
that
not
quite
right
anyway
theyre
lighting
the
nozzles
now
makes
a
big
whoosh
now
i
bring
the
microphone
closer
and
maybe
you
can
catch
the
noise
of
the
flame
hear
it
that
quite
a
roar
i
guess
old
mr
grass
is
cooked
now
now
these
boys
are
advancing
in
a
straight
line
from
the
street
up
over
the
curb
holding
their
fiery
torches
in
front
of
them
the
devilgrass
is
shriveling
up
yessir
it
shriveling
right
up
like
a
gob
of
tobaccojuice
on
a
hot
stove
theyve
burned
about
two
feet
of
it
away
already
nothing
left
but
some
smoking
stems
quite
a
lot
of
smoking
stems
a
regular
compact
mass
of
them
but
all
the
green
stuff
has
been
burned
right
off
yes
folks
burned
clean
off
i
wish
we
had
television
here
so
i
could
show
you
how
that
thick
pad
of
stems
lies
there
without
a
bit
of
life
left
in
it
now
theyre
uncovering
the
sidewalk
i
following
right
behind
with
the
microphone
maybe
you
can
hear
the
roar
of
the
weedburners
again
now
i
like
to
have
you
keep
in
mind
the
height
of
this
grass
you
never
saw
grass
as
tall
as
this
unless
youve
been
in
the
jungle
or
south
america
or
someplace
where
grass
grows
this
high
i
mean
high
even
here
at
the
sidewalk
it
well
over
a
man
head
seven
or
eight
feet
and
this
crew
is
carving
right
into
it
cutting
it
like
steel
with
an
acetylenetorch
theyre
making
big
holes
in
it
you
hear
that
hissing
that
noise
like
a
steamhose
well
that
the
grass
shriveling
think
of
it
grass
with
so
much
sap
inside
it
hisses
it
drying
right
up
in
a
now
the
top
part
is
falling
down
toppling
forward
coming
like
a
breaking
wave
oops
hay
it
put
out
one
of
the
torches
by
smothering
it
drowned
it
in
grass
nothing
serious
the
boy
got
it
lit
again
progress
is
slow
here
folks
youve
got
to
realize
this
stuff
about
ten
feet
high
further
in
it
anyway
sixteen
feet
fighting
it
like
battling
an
octopus
with
a
million
arms
the
stuff
writhes
around
and
grows
all
the
time
it
terrific
imagine
tangles
of
barbedwire
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
bales
or
rolls
or
however
barbedwire
comes
covering
your
frontyard
and
house
only
it
isnt
barbedwire
at
all
but
green
living
grass
just
a
minute
folks
i
having
a
little
trouble
with
my
microphone
cable
nothing
serious
you
understand
tangled
a
bit
in
the
grass
behind
me
those
burnt
stems
stand
by
for
just
a
minute
this
is
kpar
the
voice
of
edendale
due
to
mechanical
difficulties
there
will
be
a
brief
musical
interlude
until
contact
is
resumed
with
our
portable
transmitter
bringing
you
an
onthespot
account
of
the
unusual
grass
kirk
quork
krrmp
ar
portable
transmitter
here
i
am
again
folks
in
the
street
in
front
of
the
dinkman
residence
a
little
out
of
breath
but
none
the
worse
off
ready
to
resume
the
blowbyblow
story
of
the
fight
against
the
devilgrass
that
was
a
little
trouble
back
there
but
it
all
right
now
seems
the
weedburners
hadnt
quite
finished
off
the
grass
in
the
parkwaystrip
between
the
curb
and
the
sidewalk
and
after
i
dragged
my
microphone
cable
across
it
it
sort
of
well
it
sort
of
came
to
life
again
and
tangled
up
the
cable
it
all
right
now
though
everything
under
control
the
boys
with
the
weedburners
have
come
back
and
are
going
over
the
parkwaystrip
again
just
to
make
sure
i
want
to
tell
you
this
stuff
really
can
grow
it
amazing
simply
amazing
youve
heard
of
plants
growing
while
you
look
at
them
well
this
grows
while
you
do
look
at
it
it
grows
while
your
back
is
turned
just
to
give
you
an
example
while
the
boys
have
been
busy
a
second
time
with
the
parkwaystrip
the
grass
has
come
back
and
grown
again
over
all
they
burned
up
beyond
the
sidewalk
and
now
it
starting
to
come
back
over
the
concrete
you
can
actually
see
it
move
the
creepers
run
out
in
front
and
crawl
ahead
like
thousands
of
little
green
snakes
imagine
seeing
grass
traveling
forward
like
an
army
of
worms
an
army
you
ca
stop
because
it
alive
alive
and
coming
at
you
alive

that
way
i
debated
whether
to
inform

of
my
discovery
of
her
craziness
and
decided
against
it
on
the
bare
possibility
it
would
be

the
bug
to
make
a
special
correspondent
on
my
advice
yunderstand
always
looking
out
for
my
pals
well
why
not
the
wheel
of
fortune
had
been
a
long
time
turning
before
stopping
at
the
proper
spot
i
had
never
had
any
doubt
i
someday
be
in
a
position
to
prove
my
writing
ability
now
all
those
who
had
sneered
at
me
years
before
my
english
teachers
and
editors
who
had
been
too
jealous
to
recognize
my
existence
by
anything
more
courteous
than
a
printed
rejection
would
have
to
acknowledge
their
injustice
and
in
the
meantime
all
my
accumulated
experience
had
been
added
to
enhance
my
original
talent
i
sold
everything
that
could
be
sold
doortodoor
and
a
man
acquires
not
only
an
ease
with
words
but
a
wide
knowledge
of
human
nature
this
way
certainly
i
was
better
equipped
all
around
than
many
of
these
highly
advertised
magazine
or
newspaper
authors
well
i
do
know
if
i
could
spare
the
time
o
k
bigshot
let
me
know
if
the
market
goes
down
and
i
come
around
and
put
up
more
margin
how
much
will
mr
le
ffaçasé
how
the
hell
do
i
know
more
than
youre
worth
more
than
i
getting
because
youre
a
ninetyday
wonder
the
guy
who
put
the
crap
on
the
grass
and
sent
it
nuts
less
than
he
have
given
come
and
get
it
straight
from
the
horse
mouth
my
only
previous
visits
to
newspaper
offices
had
been
to
place
advertisements
but
i
was
prepared
to
find
the
a
veritable
hive
of
activity
perhaps
some
part
of
the
big
building
which
housed
the
paper
did
hum
but
not
the
floor
devoted
to
the
editorial
staff
that
simply
dozed
gootes
led
me
from
the
elevator
through
an
enormous
room
where
men
and
an
occasional
woman
sat
indolently
before
typewriters
stared
druggedly
into
space
or
flew
paper
airplanes
out
of
open
windows
the
only
sign
of
animation
i
saw
as
we
walked
what
might
well
have
been
a
quartermile
was
one
reporter
i
judged
him
such
by
the
undersized
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
who
enthusiastically
munched
a
sandwich
while
perusing
a
magazine
containing
photographs
of
women
with
uncovered
breasts
even
the
nipples
showed
beyond
the
cityroom
was
a
battery
of
private
offices
i
will
certainly
not
conceal
the
existence
of
my
extreme
nervousness
as
we
neared
the
proximity
of
the
famous
editor
i
hung
back
from
the
groundglass
door
inscribed
in
shabby
peeling
letters
in
distinction
to
its
neighbors
newly
and
brightly
painted
le
ffaçasé
gootes
noting
my
trepidation
put
on
the
brogue
of
a
burlesque
irishman
is
it
afraid
of
himself
you
are
me
boy
sure
think
no
more
of
it
faith
and
wasnt
he
born
billy
casey
no
better
than
the
rest
of
us
for
all
his
mother
was
a
clancy
and
related
to
the
finnegans
he
written
so
often
about
coming
from
noble
huguenot
stock
he
almost
believes
it
himself
but
the
huguenots
were
dirty
protestants
and
when
his
time
comes
w
r
send
for
the
priest
and
take
the
last
sacraments
like
the
true
son
of
the
church
he
is
in
his
heart
so
buck
up
me
boy
and
come
in
and
view
the
biggest
faker
in
journalism
but
gootes
flippancy
reassured
me
no
more
than
did
the
bare
sunlit
office
behind
the
door
i
had
somehow
perhaps
from
the
movies
expected
to
see
an
editor
desk
piled
with
copypaper
while
he
himself
used
halfadozen
telephones
at
once
simultaneously
making
incomprehensible
gestures
at
countless
underlings
but
mr
le
ffaçasé
desk
was
nude
except
for
an
enameled
snuffbox
and
a
signed
photograph
of
a
president
whose
administration
had
been
subjected
daily
to
the
editor
bitterest
jabs
on
the
walls
hung
framed
originals
of
the
more
famous
political
cartoons
of
the
last
quartercentury
but
neither
telephone
nor
scrap
of
manuscript
was
in
evidence
but
who
could
examine
that
office
with
detached
scrutiny
while
william
rufus
le
ffaçasé
occupied
it
somnolent
in
a
leather
armchair
he
opened
tiny
sunken
eyes
to
regard
us
with
less
than
interest
as
we
entered
under
a
shiny
alpaca
coat
he
wore
an
oldfashioned
collarless
shirt
whose
neckband
was
fastened
with
a
diamond
stud
neither
collar
nor
tie
competed
with
the
brilliance
of
this
flashing
gem
resting
in
a
shaven
stubblefold
of
his
draped
neck
his
face
was
remarkably
long
his
upperlip
stretching
interminably
from
a
mouth
looking
to
have
been
freshly
smeared
with
vaseline
to
a
nose
not
unlike
a
golfclub
in
shape
from
the
snuffbox
on
his
desk
which
i
imagined
a
pretty
ornament
or
receptacle
for
small
objects
he
scooped
with
a
flat
thumb
a
conical
mound
of
graybrown
dust
and
this
with
a
sweeping
upward
motion
he
pushed
into
a
gaping
nostril
chief
this
is
albert
weener
how
do
mr
weener
gootes
who
the
bloody
hell
is
weener
why
chief
he
the
guy
who
put
the
stuff
on
the
grass
oh
he
surveyed
me
with
the
attention
due
a
worthy
but
not
particularly
valuable
specimen
you
bit
the
dog
ay
weener
gootes
burst
into
a
high
appreciative
cackle
le
ffaçasé
turned
the
deathray
of
his
left
eye
on
him
youre
a
syncophant
gootes
he
stated
flatly
a
miserable
groveling
lowlivered
cringing
fawning
mealymouthed
chickenhearted
toadeating
arselicking
slobbering
syncophant
i
couldnt
see
how
we
were
ever
to
reach
the
point
this
way
so
i
ventured
i
understand
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
inoculated
mrs
dinkman
lawn
you
want
me
to
contribute
desires
grow
smaller
as
intelligence
expands
growled
le
ffaçasé
i
want
nothing
except
to
find
a
few
undisturbed
moments
in
which
to
read
the
work
of
the
immortal
hobbes
i
sorry
i
said
i
understood
you
wished
me
to
report
the
progress
of
the
wildly
growing
grass
cityeditor
province
he
declared
uninterestedly
no
such
thing
on
the
gootes
informed
me
in
a
loud
whisper
le
ffaçasé
who
evidently
heard
him
glared
reached
down
and
retrieved
the
telephone
from
its
concealment
under
the
desk
and
snarled
into
the
mouthpiece
i
hate
to
interrupt
your
crapgame
with
the
trivial
concerns
of
this
organ
men
called
a
newspaper
till
you
got
on
the
payroll
i
sending
you
a
man
who
knows
something
about
the
crazy
grass
divorce
yourself
from
whatever
pornography
youre
gloating
over
at
the
moment
to
see
if
we
can
use
him
his
immediate
obliviousness
to
our
presence
was
so
insulting
that
if
gootes
had
not
made
the
first
move
to
leave
i
should
have
done
so
myself
i
do
know
what
vast
speculations
swept
upon
him
as
he
hung
up
the
telephone
but
i
thought
he
might
at
least
have
had
the
courtesy
to
nod
a
dismissal
youre
hired
bejesus
proclaimed
gootes
and
of
course
i
was
for
there
was
no
doubt
a
brilliantly
successful
figure
like
le
ffaçasé
whatever
my
opinion
of
his
intemperate
language
or
failure
in
the
niceties
of
deportment
he
was
a
forceful
man
had
sized
me
up
in
a
flash
and
sensed
my
ability
before
i
written
a
single
line
for
his
paper
the
wage
offered
by
the
even
assuming
as
they
undoubtedly
did
that
the
affair
of
the
grass
would
be
over
shortly
and
my
service
ended
was
high
enough
to
warrant
my
buying
a
secondhand
car
a
previous
unpleasantness
with
a
financecompany
made
the
transaction
difficult
with
as
little
cash
as
i
had
on
hand
but
a
phonecall
to
the
paper
established
my
bonafides
and
i
was
soon
driving
out
sunset
boulevard
in
a
tomatocolored
roadster
meditating
on
the
longdelayed
upsurge
of
my
fortunes
the
street
was
closed
off
by
a
road
barrier
quite
some
distance
away
and
tightly
parked
cars
testified
to
the
attraction
of
the
expanding
grass
scorning
these
idle
sightseers
i
pushed
and
shoved
my
way
forward
to
what
had
now
become
the
focus
of
all
my
interests
the
dinkmans
had
lived
in
a
city
block
an
urban
entity
it
was
no
pretentious
group
of
houses
nor
was
it
a
repetitive
design
out
of
some
subdividing
contractor
greedy
mind
moderatesized
mediumpriced
middleclass
bungalows
these
were
the
homes
of
the
dinkmans
and
their
neighbors
a
sample
from
a
pattern
which
varied
but
was
basically
the
same
here
and
in
oakland
seattle
and
louis
in
chicago
philadelphia
boston
and
cleveland
but
now
i
looked
upon
no
city
scene
no
picture
built
upon
the
substantial
foundation
of
daddy
at
the
office
all
day
fixing
a
leaky
faucet
of
an
evening
painting
the
woodwork
during
his
summer
vacation
or
mom
after
a
pleasant
afternoon
with
the
girls
unstintedly
opening
cans
for
supper
and
harassedly
watching
the
cleaning
woman
who
came
in
once
a
week
an
alien
presence
a
rude
fist
through
the
canvas
negated
the
convention
that
this
was
a
picture
of
reality
a
coneshaped
hill
rose
to
a
blurred
point
marking
the
burialplace
of
the
dinkman
house
it
was
a
child
drawing
of
a
coneshaped
hill
done
in
green
crayon
too
symmetrical
too
evenly
and
heavily
green
to
be
a
spontaneous
product
of
nature
man
unimaginative
hand
was
apparent
in
its
composition
the
sides
of
the
cone
flowed
past
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
adjacent
houses
blocking
them
as
it
had
previously
blocked
the
dinkmans
but
their
inhabitants
forewarned
had
gone
more
than
mere
desertion
was
implied
in
their
going
there
was
an
implicit
surrender
abandonment
to
the
invader
the
base
of
the
cone
accepting
capitulation
and
still
aggressive
had
reached
to
the
lawns
beyond
warning
these
householders
too
to
be
ready
for
flight
over
backfences
to
dwellings
fronting
another
street
and
establishing
itself
firmly
over
the
concrete
pavement
before
the
dinkmans
door
i
would
be
suppressing
part
of
the
truth
if
i
did
not
admit
that
for
the
smallest
moment
some
perverted
pride
made
me
cherish
this
hill
as
my
work
my
creation
but
for
me
it
would
not
have
existed
i
had
done
something
notable
i
had
caused
a
stir
it
was
the
same
kind
of
sensation
i
imagine
which
makes
criminals
boast
of
their
crimes
i
quickly
dismissed
this
morbid
thought
but
it
was
succeeded
by
one
almost
equally
unhealthy
for
i
was
ridden
by
a
sudden
wild
impulse
to
touch
feel
walk
on
roll
in
the
encroaching
grass
i
tried
to
control
myself
but
no
willing
of
mine
could
prevent
me
from
going
up
and
letting
the
long
runners
slip
through
my
half
open
hands
it
was
like
receiving
some
sort
of
electric
shock
though
the
blades
were
soft
and
tender
the
stems
communicated
to
my
palms
a
feeling
of
surging
vitality
implacable
life
and
ineluctable
strength
i
drew
back
from
the
green
mass
as
though
i
had
been
doing
something
venturesome
for
no
matter
what
botanists
or
naturalists
may
tell
us
to
the
contrary
we
habitually
think
of
plantlife
as
fixed
and
stolid
insensate
and
quiescent
but
this
abnormal
growth
was
no
passive
lawn
no
sleepy
patch
of
vegetation
as
i
stood
there
with
fascinated
attention
the
thing
moved
and
kept
on
moving
not
in
one
place
but
in
thousands
not
in
one
direction
but
toward
all
points
of
the
compass
it
writhed
and
twisted
in
nightmarish
unease
expanding
extending
increasing
spreading
spreading
spreading
its
movement
by
human
standards
was
slow
but
it
was
so
monstrous
to
see
this
great
mass
of
verdure
move
at
all
that
it
appeared
to
be
going
with
express
speed
inexorably
enveloping
everything
in
its
path
a
crack
in
the
roadway
disappeared
under
it
a
shrub
was
swallowed
up
a
patch
of
wall
vanished
the
eye
shifted
from
whole
to
detail
and
back
again
the
overrun
crack
was
duplicated
by
an
untouched
one
a
few
inches
away
it
too
went
the
fine
tentacles
on
top
of
the
mound
reached
upward
shimmering
like
the
air
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
near
my
feet
hundreds
of
runners
crept
ever
closer
the
pale
stolons
shiny
and
brittle
supporting
the
ominously
bristling
green
leaves
i
hope
ive
not
given
the
impression
there
was
no
human
activity
all
this
while
that
nothing
was
being
done
to
combat
the
living
glacier
on
the
contrary
there
was
tremendous
bustle
and
industry
the
weedburning
crew
was
still
fighting
a
rearguard
action
gaining
momentary
successes
here
and
there
driving
back
the
invading
tendrils
as
they
wriggled
over
concrete
sidewalk
and
roadway
only
to
be
defeated
as
the
main
mass
piling
higher
and
ever
higher
toppled
forward
on
the
temporarily
redeemed
areas
for
on
this
vastly
thicker
bulk
the
smoky
fingers
of
flame
had
no
more
effect
than
did
the
exertions
of
the
scythemen
hacking
futilely
away
at
the
tough
intricacies
or
the
rattling
reapers
entangling
themselves
to
become
like
waterlogged
ships
but
greatest
hopes
were
now
being
pinned
on
a
new
weapon
a
dozen
black
and
sootylooking
tanktrucks
had
come
up
and
from
them
like
the
arms
of
a
squid
thick
hoses
lazily
uncoiled
hundreds
of
gallons
of
dark
crudeoil
were
being
poured
upon
the
grass
at
least
ten
bystanders
eagerly
explained
to
any
who
would
listen
the
purpose
and
value
of
this
maneuver
petroleum
deadly
enemy
of
all
rooted
things
would
unquestionably
kill
the
weed
they
might
as
well
call
off
all
the
other
silly
efforts
for
in
a
day
or
two
as
soon
as
the
oil
soaked
into
the
ground
the
roots
would
die
the
monster
collapse
and
wither
away
i
wanted
with
all
my
heart
to
believe
in
this
hope
but
when
i
compared
the
feeble
brown
trickle
to
the
vast
green
body
i
was
gravely
doubtful
shaken
and
thoughtful
i
went
back
to
my
car
and
drove
homeward
reflecting
on
the
fortuitousness
of
human
actions
had
i
not
answered
miss
francis
ad
someone
else
would
have
been
the
agent
of
calamity
had
mrs
dinkman
been
away
from
home
that
day
another
place
than
hers
or
perhaps
no
place
at
all
might
have
been
engulfed
on
the
other
hand
i
might
still
be
searching
for
a
chance
to
prove
my
merit
to
the
world
it
seemed
to
me
suddenly
man
was
but
a
helpless
creature
afterall
it
wasnt
until
i
was
almost
at
my
own
frontdoor
i
remembered
the
purpose
of
my
visit
which
was
not
to
draw
philosophic
conclusions
but
to
order
my
impressions
so
the
columns
of
the
might
benefit
by
the
reactions
of
one
so
closely
connected
with
the
spread
of
the
devilgrass
i
began
tentatively
putting
sentences
together
and
by
the
time
i
got
to
my
room
and
sat
down
with
pencil
and
paper
i
was
in
a
ferment
of
creative
activity
now
i
can
not
account
for
this
but
the
instant
i
took
the
pencil
in
my
fingers
all
thought
of
the
grass
left
my
mind
no
effort
to
summon
back
those
fine
rolling
sentences
was
of
the
least
avail
i
slapped
my
forehead
and
muttered
grass
grass
bermuda
aloud
varying
it
with
such
key
words
as
dinkman
swallowing
up
green
hill
and
the
like
but
all
i
could
think
of
was
buying
a
tire
x
for
the
left
rear
wheel
paying
my
overdue
rent
gootes
infuriating
buffoonery
the
possibilities
for
a
man
of
my
caliber
in
florida
or
new
york
and
with
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
a
nice
mailorder
business
could
be
established
to
bring
in
a
comfortable
income
i
left
the
chair
and
walked
up
and
down
the
cramped
room
until
the
lodger
below
rapped
spitefully
on
his
ceiling
i
went
to
the
bathroom
and
washed
my
hands
i
came
back
and
inspected
my
teeth
in
the
mirror
then
i
resumed
my
seat
and
wrote
the
grass
after
a
moment
i
crossed
this
out
and
substituted
today
the
grass
i
decided
the
whole
approach
was
unimaginative
and
unworthy
of
me
i
turned
the
paper
over
and
began
like
a
dragon
springing
good
good
this
was
the
way
to
start
it
would
show
the
readers
at
once
they
were
dealing
with
a
man
of
imagination
like
a
dragon
springing
springing
from
what
what
did
dragons
spring
from
anyway
eggs
like
snakes
dragons
were
reptiles
werent
they
or
werent
they
give
up
the
metaphor
i
set
my
teeth
with
determination
and
began
again
not
unlike
a
fierce
and
belligerently
furious
dragon
or
some
other
ferocious
blustery
and
furious
chimerical
creature
a
menacing
and
comminatory
debacle
is
burning
fierily
in
the
heart
of
our
fair
and
increasingly
populous
city
as
one
with
an
innocent
yet
cardinal
part
in
the
unleashing
of
this
dire
menace
i
want
to
describe
how
the
exposure
of
this
threatening
menace
affected
me
as
i
looked
upon
its
menacing
and
malevolent
advance
today
i
sat
back
not
dissatisfied
with
my
beginning
and
thought
about
the
neat
little
bachelor
apartment
i
could
rent
on
what
the
was
paying
me
of
course
in
a
few
days
this
hullabaloo
would
be
all
over
for
though
i
had
little
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
the
crudeoil
i
knew
really
drastic
measures
would
be
taken
soon
and
the
whole
business
stopped
but
even
in
so
short
a
time
there
could
be
no
doubt
mr
le
ffaçasé
would
realize
he
needed
me
permanently
on
his
staff
and
i
would
be
assured
of
a
living
in
my
own
proper
sphere
thus
fired
with
the
thoughts
of
accomplishment
i
returned
to
my
task
but
i
can
not
say
it
went
easily
i
remembered
many
great
writers
indulged
in
stimulants
in
the
throes
of
composition
but
i
decided
such
a
course
might
blunt
the
keen
edge
of
my
mind
and
afterall
there
was
no
better
stimulant
than
plain
oldfashioned
perseverance
i
picked
up
the
pencil
again
and
doggedly
went
on
to
the
next
sentence
what
the
hell
this
demanded
the
cityeditor
looking
at
my
neatly
rolled
pile
of
manuscript
i
disdained
to
bandy
words
with
an
underling
too
lazy
to
make
an
effort
to
get
at
what
was
probably
the
finest
piece
of
writing
ever
brought
to
him
so
i
unrolled
my
story
flattening
it
out
so
he
might
read
it
the
more
easily
by
the
balls
of
benjamin
franklin
and
the
little
white
fringe
on
horace
greeley
chin
this
goddamned
thing
been
wrote
by
hand
arent
there
any
typewriters
anymore
did
mister
remington
commit
suicide
unbeknownst
to
me
i
sorry
i
said
stiffly
i
didnt
think
youd
have
any
difficulty
in
reading
my
handwriting
and
in
fact
the
whole
business
was
absurd
for
if
there
anything
i
pride
myself
on
it
the
gracefulness
and
legibility
of
my
penmanship
typewriters
might
well
be
mandatory
for
the
ephemeral
news
item
but
i
had
been
hired
as
a
special
correspondent
and
someday
my
manuscript
would
be
a
valuable
property
the
cityeditor
eyed
me
in
a
most
disagreeable
fashion
i
an
educated
man
he
stated
groton
harvard
and
the
wpa
no
doubt
with
time
and
care
i
could
decipher
this
bid
for
next
year
pulitzer
prize
but
i
must
consider
the
more
handicapped
members
of
the
staff
compositors
layoutmen
and
proofreaders
without
my
advantages
and
broadmindedness
they
might
be
so
startled
by
this
innovation
as
to
have
their
usefulness
permanently
crippled
no
i
afraid
mr
weener
i
must
ask
you
to
put
this
in
more
orthodox
form
and
type
it
up
just
another
example
of
pettish
bureaucracy
the
officiousness
of
the
except
for
the
nuisance
it
didnt
particularly
matter
when
mr
le
ffaçasé
read
my
contribution
i
knew
there
would
be
no
concern
in
future
whether
it
was
handwritten
typewritten
or
engraved
in
babylonic
cuneiform
on
a
freshly
baked
brick
nevertheless
i
went
over
to
one
of
the
unoccupied
desks
and
began
to
copy
what
i
had
written
on
the
machine
i
must
say
i
was
favorably
impressed
by
the
appearance
of
my
words
in
this
form
for
they
somehow
looked
more
important
and
enduring
while
still
engaged
in
this
task
i
was
slapped
so
heartily
on
the
back
i
was
knocked
forward
against
the
typewriter
and
gootes
perched
himself
on
a
corner
of
the
desk
working
the
jolly
old
mill
what
i
say
the
old
bugger
wants
to
know
where
your
stuff
is
fact
of
the
matter
he
wants
to
know
with
quite
a
bit
of
deuced
bad
language
not
a
softspoken
chap
you
know
w
i
be
through
in
a
minute
or
two
he
gathered
his
pipe
apparently
out
of
my
left
ear
and
his
tobacco
pouch
from
the
air
and
very
rudely
without
asking
my
permission
picked
up
the
top
sheet
and
started
to
read
it
a
thick
eyebrow
shot
up
immediately
and
he
allowed
his
pipe
to
hang
slackly
from
his
mouth
purple
he
exclaimed
magenta
violet
lavender
mauve
schmaltz
real
copperriveted
brassbound
steeljacketed
castiron
schmaltz
i
havent
seen
such
a
genuine
sample
since
my
kid
sister
wrote
up
jack
the
ripper
back
in
the
manifest
discrepancy
in
these
remarks
so
confused
me
my
fingers
stumbled
over
the
typewriter
keys
evidently
he
intended
some
kind
of
humor
or
sarcasm
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
how
could
his
younger
sister
bertie
boy
he
said
after
i
had
struggled
to
get
another
paragraph
down
it
breaks
my
heart
to
see
you
toil
so
let
take
in
as
much
as
youve
done
to
the
chief
and
either
he
be
so
impressed
he
put
a
stenographer
to
transcribing
the
rest
or
else
or
else
i
prompted
or
else
he
wo
come
on
mr
le
ffaçasé
had
apparently
not
stirred
since
last
we
were
in
his
office
he
opened
his
eyes
thumbed
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
asked
gootes
where
the
bloody
hell
is
that
stuff
on
the
grass
here
it
is
chief
no
date
no
who
what
when
and
where
but
very
litry
very
very
litry
the
editor
picked
up
my
copy
and
i
could
not
help
but
watch
him
anxiously
for
some
sign
of
his
reaction
it
came
forth
promptly
and
explosively
what
the
ingenious
and
delightfully
painful
hell
is
this
gootes
reported
by
our
special
writer
albert
weener
the
man
who
inoculated
the
loony
grass
gootes
you
are
the
endproduct
of
a
long
line
of
incestuous
idiots
the
winner
of
the
boobyprize
in
any
intelligencetest
but
you
have
outdone
yourself
in
bringing
me
this
verminous
and
maggoty
ordure
said
le
ffaçasé
throwing
my
efforts
to
the
floor
and
kicking
at
them
the
outrage
made
me
boil
and
if
he
had
not
been
an
older
man
i
might
have
done
him
an
injury
as
for
you
weener
i
doubt
if
you
will
ever
be
elevated
to
the
ranks
of
idiocy
get
the
sanguinary
hell
out
of
here
and
do

here
was
i
never
to
escape
from
the
malice
inspired
by
the
envy
my
literary
talent
aroused
i
had
certainly
expected
that
a
man
of
the
famous

would
be
above
such
pettiness
i
was
too
dismayed
and
downcast
by
the
meanness
of
human
nature
to
speak
le

snuffed
again
and
looked
malevolently
at
the

a
framed
caricature
of
himself
returned
the
stare
very
well
he
grudgingly
conceded
at
length

opened
my
mouth
to

he
turned
on
me
with
a
snarl
baring
yellow
and
twisted

was
the

piloted
by
unbalanced

it
seemed
incredible
impossible
it
should
be
so
but
two
such
similar
experiences
in
so
short
a
time
apparently
supported
this
gloomy
view
horrible
i
thought
as
i
preceded

out
of
the

office
unbelievably
horrible
son
advised
gootes
never
argue
with

he
has
the
makings

apoplexy
i
hope
you
just
keep
squawking
to
the

youll
get
further

let
go

we
take
look
at
el
grasso
grosso
by
the
moonlight
however
it
was
not
moonlight
illuminating
the
weird
tumulus
but
the
glare
of
a
battery
of
searchlights
suggesting
as
gootes
irreverently
remarked
the
opening
of
a
new
supermarket
during
my
absence
the
national
guard
had
arrived
and
focused
the
great
incandescent
beams
on
the
mound
which
now
covered
five
houses
and
whose
threat
had
driven
the
inhabitants
from
as
many
more
the
powdery
blue
lights
gave
the
grass
an
uncanny
yellowish
look
as
though
it
had
been
stricken
by
a
disease
the
rays
directed
low
were
constantly
being
interrupted
by
the
bodies
of
the
militiamen
hurrying
back
and
forth
to
accomplish
some
definite
task
what
goes
on
inquired
gootes
the
officer
addressed
had
two
gleaming
silver
bars
on
his
shoulder
he
seemed
very
young
and
nervous
sorry
no
one
allowed
this
far
without
special
authorization
working
press
gootes
produced
a
reporter
badge
from
the
bars
oh
excuse
me
say
that
was
a
sharp
little
stunt
mr
name
of
jacson
gootes
captain
eltwiss
how
did
you
learn
stuff
like
that
i
looked
at
him
for
the
name
was
somehow
vaguely
familiar
but
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
i
had
never
seen
that
smooth
boyish
face
before
talent
natural
talent
what
did
you
say
all
the
shootin
was
about
getting
ready
to
tunnel
under
answered
the
officer
affably
blow
the
thing
skyhigh
from
the
middle
and
get
rid
of
it
right
now
not
going
to
let
any
grass
grow
under
our
feet
but
i
read
an
article
saying
neither
dynamite
tnt
nor
nitroglycerin
would
be
effective
against
the
grass
might
even
do
more
harm
than
good
writers
captain
eltwiss
dismissed
literature
without
even
resorting
to
an
exclamationpoint
writers
to
underline
his
confidence
the
boneshaking
chatter
of
pneumatic
chisels
began
a
syncopated
rattle
military
directness
would
accomplish
in
one
swift
decisive
stroke
at
the
heart
of
things
what
civilian
fumbling
around
the
edges
had
failed
to
do
i
looked
with
almost
sentimental
regret
at
the
great
conical
heap
i
had
brought
it
into
being
in
a
few
hours
it
would
be
gone
and
whatever
fame
its
brief
existence
had
given
me
would
be
gone
with
it
with
swift
method
the
guardsmen
started
burrowing
in
ordered
relays
fresh
workers
replaced
tired
and
the
pile
of
excavated
dirt
grew
since
their
activity
except
for
its
urgency
and
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
didnt
differ
from
labors
observable
any
time
a
street
was
repaired
or
a
foundation
laid
i
saw
no
point
in
watching
hour
after
hour
i
thought
gootes
persistence
less
a
devotion
to
duty
than
the
idle
curiosity
which
makes
grown
men
gape
at
a
steamshovel
my
hints
being
lost
on
him
i
ascertained
the
hour
they
expected
to
be
finished
and
went
home
excitement
or
no
excitement
i
saw
no
reason
to
abandon
all
routine
my
forethought
was
proven
when
i
returned
refreshed
in
midmorning
as
the
last
shovelfuls
of
dirt
came
from
the
tunnel
and
the
explosive
charges
were
hurried
to
their
place
there
was
reason
for
haste
while
the
tunneling
had
been
going
on
all
the
grassfighting
activity
had
ceased
for
the
militia
had
ordered
weedburners
reapers
bulldozers
and
the
rest
off
the
scene
the
weed
unhampered
for
the
first
time
since
mrs
dinkman
attacked
it
with
her
lawnmower
responded
by
growing
and
growing
until
more
and
more
guardsmen
had
to
be
detached
to
the
duty
of
keeping
it
back
from
the
excavation
by
the
very
means
they
had
scorned
so
recently
even
their
most
frantic
efforts
could
not
prevent
the
grass
from
sending
its
most
advanced
tendrils
down
into
the
gaping
hole
where
the
wires
were
being
laid
to
detonate
the
charge
there
was
so
much
dashing
to
and
fro
so
many
orders
relayed
so
many
dispatches
delivered
that
i
thought
i
might
have
been
witnessing
an
outofdate
civilwar
play
instead
of
a
peacetime
action
of
the
california
national
guard
captain
eltwiss
i
kept
wondering
where
i
heard
the
name
was
constantly
being
interrupted
in
what
was
apparently
a
very
friendly
conversation
with
gootes
by
the
arrival
of
officiallooking
envelopes
which
he
immediately
stuffed
into
his
pocket
with
every
indication
of
vexation
silly
old
fools
he
muttered
each
time
the
incident
happened
quick
inspections
made
plans
checked
an
order
was
rasped
to
clear
the
vicinity
gootes
agonized
protest
that
he
had
to
report
the
occasion
for
the
readers
was
ignored
ca
start
making
exceptions
explained
captain
eltwiss
everyone
workingpress
militia
sightseers
and
all
had
to
move
back
a
couple
of
blocks
where
intervening
trees
and
houses
cut
us
off
from
any
view
of
the
green
hill
this
is

what
about

i
objected
with
a
mental
picture
of

bursting
into

nearest

demanding

the
roof
bushwa

no

z
old
box
over

allons
it
wasnt
till
he
had
urged
me
inside
and
up
a
flight
of
stairs
that
i
realized
the
box
was
miss
francis
apartmenthouse
it
had
been
a
logical
choice
since
its
height
and
ugliness
distinguished
it
even
from
its
unhandsome
neighbors
less
than
a
week
had
gone
by
since
i
had
come
here
for
the
first
time
as
i
followed
gootes
grasshopper
leaps
upward
at
a
more
dignified
pace
i
reflected
how
strangely
my
circumstances
had
changed
the
shoddily
carpeted
halls
were
musty
and
still
as
we
climbed
except
for
the
unheeded
squeaking
of
a
radio
someone
had
forgotten
to
turn
off
you
could
always
tell
when
a
radio
was
being
listened
to
for
when
disregarded
it
sulkily
gave
off
painfully
listless
noises
in
frustration
and
loneliness
i
wasnt
at
all
surprised
to
find
miss
francis
among
the
spectators
crowded
on
the
roof
in
evidence
of
having
no
more
important
occupation
i
somehow
expected
you
have
you
any
new
tricks
she
asked
gootes
coaxingly
ecod
your
worship
wot
time
ave
i
for
legerdemain
wif
your
elp
now
i
be
a
fine
stead
of
a

she
said
genially
busy
with
the
toothpick
youll
find
enough
respectable
laboratory
mechanics
eager
to
cooperate
how
long
will
it
be
before
they
shoot
do
you
know
gootes
shook
his
head
and
i
strained
my
eyes
toward
the
grass
symmetrical
and
shimmeringly
green
removed
as
it
now
was
from
all
connotations
of
danger
by
distance
and
the
promise
of
immediate
destruction
it
showed
serenely
beautiful
and
unaffected
by
the
machinations
of
its
attackers
i
could
almost
have
wept
as
i
traced
its
sloping
sides
upward
to
the
rounded
peak
on
top
reversing
all
previous
impressions
it
now
appeared
to
be
the
natural
inhabitant
and
all
the
houses
roadways
pavements
fences
automobiles
lightpoles
and
the
rest
of
the
evidences
of
civilization
the
intruders
but
even
as
i
looked
at
it
so
eagerly
it
moved
and
wavered
and
i
heard
the
muffled
boom
of
explosion
the
roof
trembled
and
windows
rattled
with
diminishing
echoes
the
noise
was
neither
a
great
nor
terrifying
one
and
i
distinctly
remember
thinking
it
quite
inadequate
to
the
occasion
i
believe
all
of
us
there
when
we
heard
the
report
expected
to
see
a
vast
hole
where
the
grass
had
been
i
sure
i
did
when
it
was
clear
this
hadnt
happened
i
continued
to
stare
hard
thinking
since
my
highschool
physics
was
so
hazy
i
had
somehow
reversed
the
relative
speed
of
sight
and
sound
and
we
had
heard
the
noise
before
seeing
the
destruction
but
the
green
bulk
was
still
there
oh
not
unchanged
by
any
means
the
smooth
picturebook
slope
had
become
jagged
and
bruised
while
the
regular
evenlyrounded
apex
had
turned
into
a
sort
of
phrygian
cap
with
its
pinnacle
woundedly
askew
the
outlines
which
had
been
sharp
were
now
blurred
its
evenness
had
become
scraggly
the

was
vexed
the

on
its
being
had
hurt
but
not
mortally
for
even
with

altered
it
remained
defiant
certain
inexorable
the
air
was
filled
with
small
green
particles
whirling
and
floating
downward
feathery
yet
clumsy
they
refused
to
obey
gravity
and
seek
the
earth
urgently
but
instead
shifted
and
changed
direction
coyly
spiraling
upward
and
sideways
before
yielding
to
the
inevitable
attraction

by

to
say
any
part
of
the

the
leaves
or
flowers
separated
from
the

whole
upon
receiving
water
and

will
root
itself
and

entity
the
dispersion
of
the
mass
far
from
making
the
whole
less
as
our
literary
friend
so
ingenuously
assumes
increases
it
to
what
mathematicians
call
the
power
because
each
particle
finding
a
new
restingplace
unhampered
by
the
competition
for
food
it
encountered
when
integrated
with
the
parent
mass
now
becomes
capable
of
spreading
infinitely
itself
unless
checked
by
factors
which
deprive
it
of
sustenance
these
facts
have
been
repeated
a
hundred
times
in
letters
telegrams
and
newspaper
articles
since
the
project
of
attempting
to
blow
up
the
inoculated
batch
was
known
in
spite
of
warnings
the
authorities
chose
to
go
ahead
no
make
no
mistake
this
fiasco
has
not
set
back
a
millimeter
rather
it
has
advanced
it
tremendously
there
was
silence
while
we
absorbed
this
unpleasant
bit
of
information
gootes
was
the
first
to
regain
his
usual
cockiness
and
he
asked
you
say
fiasco
professor
o
k
can
you
tell
us
just
why
it
was
a
fiasco
i
know
they
stuck
enough
soup
under
it
to
blow
the
whole
works
and
when
it
went
off
it
gave
out
with
a
good
bang
certainly

in
what
may
be
called
jumps
that
is
the
stems
are
short
and
jointed
those
aboveground
the
true
stems
are
called
stolons
and
those
below
from
which
the

spread
are
rhizomes

it
as

twelve

deep

it

trinitrotoluene
and

if
you

lesser

duplicated
and
accounted
for
the
situation
in

everything
now
seemed
unusually
and
perhaps
because
of
the
contrast
unreasonably
quiet
downstairs
the
radio
which
had
been
monotonously
soothing
a
presumptive
audience
of
unsatisfied
housewives
with
languid
ballads
raised
its
pitch
several
tones
as
though
for
the
first
time
it
had
become
interested
in
what
it
purveyed
yes
unseen
friends
god
is
preparing
his
vengeance
for
wickedness
and
sin
even
as
you
are
listening
you
have
been
warned
many
times
of
the
wrath
to
come
but
i
say
to
you
the
wrath
is
at
hand
even
now
god
is
giving
you
a
sign
of
his
displeasure
a
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
hand
but
o
my
unseen
friends
that
cloud
has
within
it
all
the
storms
cyclones
typhoons
hurricanes
and
tornadoes
necessary
to
destroy
you
and
yours
unless
you
repent
of
your
pride
and
sloth
judgment
will
surely
come
upon
you
the
lord
has
taken
a
simple
and
despisèd
weed
and
caused
it
to
multiply
in
defiance
of
all
your
puny
powers
and
efforts
o
my
friends
do
not
fight
this
grass
but
cherish
it
do
not
allow
it
to
be
cut
down
for
it
is
full
of
significance
for
you
call
off
all
your
minions
and
repent
lest
if
the
holy
messenger
be
injured
a
more
terrible
one
is
sent
but
now
my
friends
i
see
my
time
is
up
please
send
your
contributions
so
urgently
needed
to
carry
on
the
divine
work
to
brother
paul
care
of
the
station
to
which
you
are
listening
that
one
way
of
looking
at
it
said
gootes
adios
amigos
he
went
down
the
stairs
at
an
even
more
breakneck
pace
than
he
had
come
up
almost
in
front
of
the
apartmenthouse
door
we
nearly
collided
with
two
officers
in
angry
dispute
you
mean
to
tell
me
captain
that
not
one
of
the
urgent
orders
to
suspend
operations
came
through
to
you
colonel
i
havent
seen
a
thing
against
the
project
except
some
fool
articles
in
a
newspaper
suddenly
i
remembered
where
i
seen
the
name
eltwiss
it
was
on
the
financial
page
not
far
away
from
the
elusive
quotation
on
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
concentrates
for
which
i
been
idly
searching
eltwiss
explosives
cut
melon
funny
how
things
come
back
to
you
as
soon
as
you
put
them
out
of
your
mind
miss
francis
who
had
followed
us
down
was
busy
collecting
some
of
the
stolons
which
were
still
floating
lazily
downward
an
illiterate
patchwork
of
lifeless
and
uninteresting
scribbling
appeared
under
my
byline
day
after
day
in
the
not
a
word
not
a
thought
of
my
own
was
left
i
was
not
restrained
from
protest
by
the
absurd
threats
of
le
ffaçasé
but
prudence
dictated
not
throwing
away
dirty
water
before
i
got
clean
and
the
money
from
the
paper
while
negligible
of
course
yet
provided
my
most
pressing
needs
as
i
was
being
paid
for
my
name
while
my
talents
went
to
waste
i
was
free
to
go
anywhere
i
pleased
but
i
had
little
desire
to
leave
the
vicinity
of
the
grass
it
exerted
upon
me
more
understandably
the
same
fascination
as
on
the
merely
curious
but
i
was
not
permitted
unmolested
access
to
the
phenomenon
with
which
i
was
so
closely
concerned
an
officious
young
guardsman
warned
me
away
brusquely
and
i
was
not
allowed
to
come
near
until
i
swallowed
my
pride
and
claimed
connection
with
the
even
then
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
explain
myself
to
several
nervous
soldiers
on
pain
of
being
ordered
from
the
spot
i
was
struck
as
i
had
not
been
before
by
the
dynamic
quality
of
the
grass
never
the
same
for
successive
instants
constant
movement
and
struggle
as
the
expanding
parts
fought
for
room
among
themselves
pushing
upward
and
outward
seemed
to
indicate
perceptible
sentience
permeating
the
whole
body
preparing
brooding
it
was
disturbed
searching
alert
its
external
aspect
reflected
the
change
the
proportions
of
height
to
breadth
had
altered
since
the
explosion
the
peak
had
disappeared
flattening
out
into
an
irregular
plateau
its
progress
across
the
ground
however
had
been
vastly
accelerated
it
had
crossed
the
streets
on
all
sides
of
the
block
and
was
spreading
with
great
rapidity
over
the
whole
district
for
the
moment
no
new
effort
was
apparently
being
made
to
halt
its
progress
the
activities
of
the
militia
being
confined
to
patrolling
the
area
and
shooing
decent
citizens
away
i
wondered
if
a
new
strategy
contemplated
allowing
the
thing
to
exhaust
itself
since
it
looked
more
vigorous
with
each
passing
hour
i
saw
myself
on
the
payroll
of
the
for
a
long
time
to
come
captain
eltwiss
walked
by
and
i
asked
him
if
this
were
so
worry
he
reassured
me
we
hep
now
with
the
actual
unbeatable
mccoy
park
the
body
and
watch
what
happens
to
old
mr
grass
i
had
every
intention
of
staying
and
i
thought
it
advisable
to
remain
close
to
the
captain
in
order
if
his
boast
were
wellfounded
to
be
in
on
the
kill
he
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
although
i
did
not
think
it
tactful
to
refer
to
it
it
was
evident
his
little
difference
with
the
colonel
about
the
unreceived
orders
had
not
affected
him
we
chatted
amiably
i
mentioned
what
miss
francis
had
said
about
the
weed
springing
up
in
new
places
from
each
of
the
shreds
dispersed
by
the
explosion
but
he
merely
shrugged
and
laughed
i
know
these
longbearded
scientific
nuts
they
can
find
calamity
around
the
corner
quicker
than
a
drunk
can
find
a
bar
the
discoverer
of
the
metamorphizer
is
a
woman
so
her
long
beard
is
doubtful
i
told
him
just
a
little
irritated
by
his
cocksureness
he
laughed
with
as
much
ease
at
himself
as
at
anything
else
a
woman
scientist
ay
funny
things
womenll
do
when
they
ca
get
a
man
but
longbearded
or
flatchested
it
all
the
same
gruesome
that
what
they
are
gruesome
forget
it
after
we
get
this
cleaned
up
we
take
care
of
any
others
that
start
but
personally
i
do
think
therell
be
any
sounds
like
a
lot
of
theory
to
me
i
looked
contemptuously
at
him
for
he
had
that
unimaginative
approach
which
disdains
science
and
so
holds
civilization
back
on
its
upward
path
if
the
world
future
rested
with
people
like
this
i
thought
we
should
never
have
had
dynamite
or
germtheories
or
airplanes
capable
of
destroying
whole
cities
at
a
blow
but
captain
eltwiss
was
a
servant
to
the
science
he
looked
down
on
the
answer
he
had
bragged
about
now
appeared
and
it
was
a
scientific
contribution
if
ever
there
was
one
a
division
of
tanks
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
with
what
appeared
to
be
sledrunners
invertedly
attached
to
their
fronts
rolled
into
sight
wirecutters
he
explained
with
pride
same
equipment
used
for
barbedwire
on
the
normandy
beachhead
go
through
anything
like
cheese
the
tanks
drew
up
in
a
semicircle
and
the
drivers
came
out
of
their
vehicles
for
lastminute
preparations
a
final
check
was
made
of
gas
oil
and
the
positions
of
the
wirecutters
maps
showing
the
location
of
each
house
now
covered
by
the
grass
were
studied
and
compasspoints
checked
against
them
i
admired
the
thoroughness
and
efficiency
of
the
arrangements
so
did
the
captain
the
idea
is
simple
these
tanks
are
shocktroops
theyll
cut
their
way
into
the
middle
of
the
stuff
this
will
give
us
entranceways
and
a
central
operating
point
besides
hitting
the
grass
where
its
strength
is
greatest
from
there
he
paused
impressively
from
there
we
throw
everything
in
the
book
at
it
and
a
few
that
arent
all
the
stuff
they
used
before
we
came
only
we
use
it
efficiently
and
everything
else
even
stuff
just
got
the
release
from
washington
the
minute
one
of
these
stems
shows
we
stamp
it
out
we
fight
it
and
fight
it
until
we
beat
it
and
we
wo
leave
a
bit
of
it
no
sir
not
one
bit
of
it
alive
he
looked
at
me
triumphantly
behind
his
triumph
was
a
hint
of
the
vast
resources
and
the
slowmoving
but
unassailable
force
his
uniform
represented
it
sounded
as
though
he
had
been
correct
in
his
boast
and
something
drastic
indeed
would
happen
to
mr
grass
the
tanks
were
ready
to
go
at
last
and
the
drivers
climbed
back
into
them
and
disappeared
leaving
the
steel
monsters
looking
as
though
theyd
swallowed
the
men
like
bubbles
of
air
in
a
narrow
glass
tube
they
began
to
jerk
backward
and
forward
until
at
some
signal
i
presume
given
by
radio
they
jumped
ahead
their
exhausts
bellowing
defiance
of
the
grass
mauled
and
torn
by
their
treads
they
went
onward
with
careless
scorn
leaving
behind
a
bruised
and
trampled
pathway
the
captain
followed
in
the
track
and
i
after
him
though
i
must
admit
it
was
not
without
some
trepidation
i
put
my
feet
upon
the
battered
and
now
lifeless
mass
packed
into
a
hard
roadbed
for
i
recalled
clearly
how
the
grass
had
wrenched
the
ladder
from
the
firemen
and
how
it
had
impishly
attacked
the
broadcaster
equipment
the
tanks
moved
ahead
steadily
until
the
slope
of
the
mound
began
to
rise
sharply
and
the
runners
of
grass
instead
of
flattening
obediently
behind
curled
and
twisted
grotesquely
as
the
tracks
passed
over
them
lightly
slapping
at
the
impervious
steel
sides
small
bunches
mutilated
and
crushed
sprang
back
into
erectness
larger
ones
flopped
limply
as
their
props
were
pushed
aside
then
suddenly
the
tank
we
were
trailing
disappeared
there
was
no
warning
one
second
it
was
pursuing
its
way
an
implacable
executioner
the
next
it
had
plunged
into
the
weed
and
was
lost
to
sight
the
ends
of
the
grass
came
together
spitefully
behind
it
weaving
themselves
together
knitting
as
we
watched
an
opaque
blanket
it
closed
over
and
around
so
that
the
smooth
track
ended
abruptly
bitten
by
a
wiry
green
portcullis
i
was
dismayed
but
the
captain
seemed
happy
now
we
getting
somewhere
he
exclaimed
the
little
devils
are
eating
right
into
the
heart
of
the
old
sonofabitch
we
stood
there
gaping
stupidly
after
our
lost
champion
but
the
grass
mound
was
enigmatic
and
offered
us
no
information
as
to
its
progress
a
survey
of
the
other
tracks
showed
their
tanks
too
had
burrowed
into
the
heart
of
the
weed
like
so
many
hounds
after
a
rabbit
well
said
the
captain
who
by
now
had
apparently
accepted
me
as
his
confidant
let
go
and
see
what
coming
in
over
the
radio
i
was
glad
to
be
reminded
the
tanks
werent
lost
even
temporarily
and
that
we
would
soon
learn
of
their
advance
field
headquarters
had
been
set
up
in
a
house
about
two
blocks
away
and
there
after
exchanging
salutes
passwords
and
assorted
badinage
the
captain
led
the
men
in
contact
with
the
tanks
shoulders
hunched
fingers
rapid
with
pad
and
pencil
were
sitting
in
a
row
by
a
wall
on
which
had
been
tacked
a
large
and
detailed
map
of
the
district
in
addition
to
their
earphones
a
loudspeaker
had
also
been
thoughtfully
set
up
apparently
to
take
care
of
any
such
curious
visitors
as
ourselves
the
disadvantage
soon
manifest
was
that
no
plan
had
been
devised
to
unscramble
the
reports
from
the
various
tanks
as
a
consequence
whenever
two
or
three
came
in
together
the
reports
overlapped
resulting
in
a
jumble
of
unintelligible
sounds
from
the
loudspeaker
brf
brf
brm
it
was
saying
as
we
entered
the
room
rrr
rrr
about
three
hundred
meters
khorof
khorof
khorof
north
by
northeast
can
you
hear
me
fhq
come
in
fhq
there
was
a
further
muddle
of
words
then
i
think
my
motor
going
to
conk
out
shall
i
backtrack
fhq
come
in
fhq
rugged
place
to
stall
commented
captain
eltwiss
sympathetically
but
we
can
pull
him
out
in
halfashake
soons
we
get
things
under
control
the
loudspeaker
after
a
great
deal
of
gibberish
condescended
to
clarity
again
about
five
hundred
meters
supposed
to
join
at
this
point
ca
raise
him
by
radio
what
do
you
have
on
fhq
come
in
fhq
i
was
still
speculating
as
to
what
had
happened
to
when
the
loudspeaker
once
more
became
intelligible
and
the
going
getting
tougher
all
the
time
i
do
believe
these
goddamned
wirecutters
are
worth
a
pissinasnowhole
just
fouled
up
that
what
they
are
just
fouled
up
got
further
if
theyd
been
left
off
his
grumbling
was
blotted
out
for
a
moment
there
was
complete
babel
then
if
i
can
guess
it
somehow
got
in
the
motor
and
shorted
the
ignition
ive
got
to
take
a
chance
and
get
out
to
look
at
it
this
is
reporting
to
fhq
now
leaving
the
transmitter
stalled
so
i
turned
on
my
lights
can
you
hear
me
fhq
come
in
fhq
o
k
o
k
do
get
sore
so
i
turned
on
my
lights
i
not
going
to
do
a
bob
trout
but
i
want
to
tell
you
it
pretty
creepy
i
guess
this
stuff
looks
pretty
and
green
enough
on
top
especially
in
daylight
but
from
where
i
am
now
it
like
an
illustration
out
of
grimm
something
about
the
place
where
the
wicked
ogre
lived
not
a
bit
of
green
not
a
bit
of
light
except
from
my
own
which
penetrate
about
two
feet
ahead
and
stop
dead
yellow
and
reddishbrown
stems
thick
interlaced
how
the
hell
i
ever
got
this
far
i
like
to
know
but
not
as
much
as
how
i
going
to
get
out
i
sticking
my
head
out
of
the
turret
now
as
far
as
these
stemsll
let
me
which
isnt
far
theyre
a
solid
mass
on
top
of
the
machine
and
beside
it
i
going
to
take
a
few
tools
and
make
for
the
engine
only
thing
to
do
ca
sit
here
and
describe
grassroots
to
you
dogrobbers
all
day
long
see
if
i
ca
get
her
running
and
back
out
then
i
resign
from
the
state
of
california
right
then
this
is
leaving
the
transmitter
for
essential
repairs
and
signing
off
for
hours
the
reports
kept
coming
in
all
in
identically
the
same
vein
rapid
progress
followed
by
a
slowdown
then
either
engine
trouble
or
a
failure
to
keep
rendezvous
by
another
tank
all
messages
concluding
alike
now
leaving
transmitter
it
was
no
use
for
field
headquarters
frantically
to
order
them
to
stay
in
their
tanks
no
matter
what
happened
they
were
young
ablebodied
impatient
men
and
when
something
went
wrong
they
crawled
out
to
fight
their
way
through
a
few
feet
of
grass
to
fix
it
afterall
they
were
in
the
heart
of
a
great
city
their
machines
had
burrowed
straightforwardly
into
the
grass
and
no
threats
of
courtmartial
could
make
them
sit
and
look
silly
till
help
arrived
and
they
were
tamely
rescued
so
one
by
one
they
wormed
their
way
out
to
fix
the
ignition
adjust
the
carburetor
or
hack
free
the
cogs
which
moved
the
tracks
and
one
by
one
their
radios
became
silent
and
were
not
heard
again
the
captain
went
from
cockiness
to
doubt
from
doubt
to
anxiety
and
then
to
anguished
fury
he
had
been
so
completely
confident
of
the
maneuver
outcome
that
its
failure
drove
him
not
to
despair
but
to
anger
he
knew
most
of
the
tankdrivers
personally
and
the
picture
of
these
friends
trapped
in
their
tiny
evernarrowing
pockets
of
green
sent
him
into
a
frenzy
that
lew
brown
do
get
out
lew
stay
where
you
are
you
jackass
stay
where
you
are
lew
he
bellowed
into
the
unresponsive
loudspeaker
jake
white
jake
white
in
four
said
i
buy
him
a
drink
afterwards
joke
he
a
cocacola
boy
why
ca
you
stay
inside
jake
why
you
stay
put
unable
to
bear
it
longer
he
rushed
from
field
headquarters
shouting
let
get
out
boys
let
get
out
and
would
personally
have
led
a
volunteer
party
charging
on
foot
into
the
grass
if
he
had
not
been
forcibly
restrained
and
sympathetically
led
away
sobbing
hysterically
toward
hospitalization
and
calming
treatment
the
captain
impulse
though
impractical
was
shared
by
all
his
comrades
for
the
moment
the
destruction
of
the
grass
became
secondary
to
the
rescue
of
the
trapped
tankmen
if
field
headquarters
had
bustled
before
it
now
turned
into
a
veritable
beehive
with
officers
shouting
exhorting
complaining
and
men
running
backwards
and
forwards
as
though
there
were
no
specific
for
the
situation
except
unlimited
quantities
of
their
own
sweat
it
would
be
futile
to
relate
even
if
i
could
recall
them
all
the
various
methods
and
devices
which
were
suggested
and
rejected
or
tried
and
proved
failures
in
the
attempt
to
rescue
the
tankdrivers
press
and
radio
followed
every
daring
essay
and
carefully
planned
endeavor
until
the
last
vicarious
quiver
had
been
wrung
from
a
fascinated
public
for
twentyfour
hours
there
was
no
room
on
the
front
pages
of
the
newspapers
for
anything
but
the
latest
on
the
prisoners
of
the
grass
as
they
were
at
first
called
later
when
hope
for
their
rescue
had
diminished
and
they
were
forced
from
the
limelight
to
make
way
for
later
developments
they
were
known
simply
as
heroes
in
the
fight
against
the
weird
enemy
for
the
grass
had
not
paused
chivalrously
during
the
interval
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
to
take
renewed
vigor
from
the
victims
it
had
entombed
house
after
house
block
after
block
were
engulfed
the
names
of
those
forced
from
their
homes
were
no
longer
treated
individually
and
written
up
as
separate
stories
but
listed
in
alphabetical
order
like
battle
casualties
miss
francis
frantically
trying
to
get
all
her
specimens
and
equipment
moved
from
her
kitchen
in
time
had
been
ousted
from
the
peeling
stucco
and
joined
those
who
were
finding
shelter
with
some
difficulty
in
other
parts
of
the
city
the
southernmost
runners
crept
down
toward
hollywood
boulevard
where
every
effort
was
being
marshaled
to
combat
them
and
the
northernmost
wandered
around
and
seemingly
lost
themselves
in
the
desert
of
sagebrush
and
greasewood
about
hollywood
bowl
traffic
through
cahuenga
pass
the
great
artery
between
los
angeles
and
its
tributary
valley
was
threatened
with
disruption
but
while
the
parent
body
was
spreading
out
its
offspring
as
miss
francis
foresaw
had
come
into
existence
dozens
of
nuclei
were
reported
some
close
at
hand
others
far
away
as
the
sunset
strip
and
hollywoodland
these
smaller
bodies
were
vigorously
attacked
as
soon
as
discovered
but
of
course
they
had
in
every
case
made
progress
too
great
to
be
countered
for
they
were
at
first
naturally
indistinguishable
from
ordinary
devilgrass
and
by
the
time
their
true
character
was
determined
so
rapid
was
their
growth
they
were
already
beyond
all
possibility
of
control
the
grass
was
now
everyone
primary
thought
replacing
the
moon
among
lovers
the
incometax
among
individuals
of
importance
the
weather
among
strangers
and
illness
among
ladies
no
longer
interested
in
the
moon
as
topics
of
conversation
old
friends
meeting
casually
after
many
years
lapse
greeted
each
other
with
what
the
latest
on
the
grass
radiocomedians
fired
gagmen
with
weeks
of
service
behind
them
for
failure
to
provide
botanical
quips
or
conversely
hired
raw
writers
who
had
inhabited
the
fringes
of
hollywood
since
mack
sennett
days
on
the
strength
of
a
single
agrostological
illusion
newspapers
ran
long
articles
on
and
the
editors
of
their
garden
sections
were
roused
from
the
somnolence
into
which
they
had
sunk
upon
receiving
their
appointment
and
shoved
into
doubleleaded
boldfaced
position
textbooks
on
botany
began
outselling
popular
novels
and
a
mere
work
of
fiction
having
the
accidental
title
than
you
was
catapulted
onto
the
bestseller
list
before
anyone
realized
it
wasnt
an
academic
discussion
of
the
family
gramineae
contributors
to
scientifiction
magazines
burst
bloodvessels
happily
turning
out
ten
thousand
words
a
day
describing
their
heroes
adventures
amid
the
red
grass
of
mars
or
the
blue
grass
of
venus
after
they
had
singlehanded
with
the
help
of
a
deathray
and
the
heroine
pure
love
conquered
the
green
grass
of
tellus
professors
shy
and
otherwise
were
lured
from
their
classrooms
to
lecture
before
ladies
clubs
hitherto
sacred
to
the
accents
of
transoceanic
celebrities
and
eleanor
roosevelt
there
they
competed
on
alternate
forums
with
literate
gardeners
and
stuttering
horticultural
amateurs
stolon
rhizome
and
culm
became
words
replacing
crankshaft
and
piston
in
the
popular
vocabulary
the
puerile
reports
gootes
fabricated
under
my
name
as
the
man
responsible
for
the
phenomenon
were
syndicated
in
newspapers
from
coast
to
coast
and
a
query
as
to
rates
was
received
from
the
brother
paul
exhortations
on
the
radio
increased
in
both
length
and
intensity
as
the
grass
spread
pastors
of
other
churches
and
conductors
of
similar
programs
denounced
him
as
misled
realestate
operators
fearful
of
all
this
talk
about
the
grass
bringing
doom
and
so
depreciating
the
value
of
their
properties
complained
to
the
federal
communications
commission
sundayschools
voted
him
the
man
of
the
year
and
hundreds
of
motherly
ladies
stored
the
studio
with
cakes
baked
by
their
own
hands
brother
paul
answer
to
indorser
and
detractor
alike
was
to
buy
up
more
radiotime
no
one
doubted
the
government
would
at
length
awaken
from
its
apathy
and
counter
the
menace
swiftly
and
efficiently
as
always
before
in
crises
when
the
country
was
threatened
the
nation
with
the
highest
rate
of
production
per
manhour
the
greatest
efficiency
per
machine
the
greatest
wealth
per
capita
and
the
greatest
vision
per
mindseye
was
not
going
to
be
defeated
by
a
mere
weed
however
overgrown
while
waiting
the
inevitable
action
and
equally
inevitable
solution
the
public
had
all
the
excitement
of
war
without
suffering
the
accompanying
privations
and
bereavements
the
grass
was
a
nuisance
but
a
nuisance
with
titillating
compensations
most
people
felt
like
children
whose
schoolhouse
had
burned
down
they
were
sorry
they
knew
there
be
a
new
one
they
were
quite
ready
to
help
build
it
but
in
the
meantime
it
was
fun
the
was
gorged
with
letters
from
its
readers
on
the
subject
of
the
grass
many
of
them
wanted
to
know
what
a
newspaper
of
its
standing
meant
by
devoting
so
much
space
to
an
ephemeral
happening
while
many
more
asked
indignantly
why
more
space
wasnt
given
to
something
affecting
their
very
lives
and
fortunes
communist
partymembers
using
improbable
pennames
asked
passionately
if
this
was
not
a
direct
result
of
the
country
failure
to
come
to
a
thorough
understanding
with
the
soviet
union
terrified
propertyholders
irately
demanded
that
something
something
be
done
before
realestate
became
as
valueless
in
southern
california
as
it
already
was
in
red
russia
technocrats
demanded
the
government
be
immediately
turned
over
to
a
committee
of
engineers
and
competent
agronomists
who
would
deal
with
the
situation
as
it
deserved
after
harnessing
the
wasted
energy
of
the
populace
nationalists
hinted
darkly
that
the
whole
thing
was
the
result
of
a
plot
by
the
elders
of
zion
and
that
kaplan
delicatessen
in
conspiracy
with
a
cohen
notions
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
grass
brother
paul
wrote
and
his
letter
was
printed
for
he
now
advertised
his
radioprograms
in
the
columns
of
the
that
caesar
presumably
the
state
of
california
had
been
chastened
for
arrogating
to
itself
things
not
to
be
rendered
unto
caesar
and
the
tankmen
had
deservedly
perished
for
their
sacrilege
the
letter
aroused
fury
the
followers
of
brother
paul
either
didnt
read
the
or
were
satisfied
their
leader
needed
no
championing
if
they
did
and
other
letters
poured
in
calling
for
various
expressions
of
popular
disapproval
from
simple
boycott
up
through
tarring
and
feathering
to
plain
and
elaborated
with
gasoline
and
castration
lynching
the
grass
was
a
hot
topic
with
its
acute
perception
of
the
popular
taste
le

paper
printed
not
only
most
of
the
communications
the
unprintable
ones
were
circulated
among
the
staff
till
they
wore
out
or
disappeared
mysteriously
in
the
gents
room
but
maps
showing
the
daily
progress
of

guesses
as
to

having

day
the
paper
even
went
further
and
offered
a
reward
of
ten
thousand
dollars
to
anyone
advancing
a
suggestion
leading
to
the
destruction
of
the
intruder
its
circulation
jumped
at
the
expense
of
less
perspicacious
rivals
and
the
incoming
mail
already
many
times
normal
swelled
to
staggering
proportions
the
contest
was
taken
with
deadly
seriousness
for
the
livelihood
of
many
of
the
paper
readers
was
suddenly
threatened
by
its
subject
and
from
a
new
quarter
in
the
same
issue
as
the
offered
reward
there
appeared
an
interview
with
the
accredited
head
of
the
organized
motionpicture
producers
this
retiring
gentleman
was
rumored
to
be
completely
illiterate
an
unquestionable
slander
for
he
had
written
checks
to
support
every
cause
dedicated
to
keeping
wages
where
they
belonged
and
seeing
the
wage
earners
didnt
waste
the
money
so
benevolently
supplied
by
their
employers
i
got
the
details
of
the
interview
from
the
interviewer
himself
the
magnate
he
had
no
objection
to
the
description
had
been
irritable
and
minced
no
words
the
grass
was
bad
alike
for
production
and
boxoffice
taking
everyone
mind
off
the
prime
business
of
making
and
viewing
motionpictures
it
was
injuring
the
industry
and
he
couldnt
conceal
the
fact
that
the
industry
speaking
through
his
mouth
and
with
his
vocabulary
was
annoyed
unless
this
disgraceful
episode
ends
within
ten
days
he
had
said
sternly
the
motion
picture
industry
will
move
to
florida
it
was
an
ultimatum
southern
californians
heard
and
trembled
the
last
time
this
dread
interdiction
had
been
invoked
in
the
midst
of
a
bitter
election
fight
it
had
sent
them
scurrying
to
the
polls
to
do
their
benefactor
bidding
now
indeed
the
grass
menace
would
be
taken
seriously
the
next
day
paper
had
news
of
more
immediate
concern
to
me
the
governor
had
appointed
a
special
committee
to
investigate
the
situation
and
the
first
two
witnesses
to
be
called
were
josephine
spencer
francis
and
albert
weener
william
rufus
le
ffaçasé
was
as
enthusiastic
as
his
phlegmatic
nature
permitted
he
called
me
into
his
office
and
half
raised
the
snuffbox
off
the
desk
as
though
to
offer
me
an
unwelcome
pinch
youre
a
made
man
now
weener
he
said
thinking
better
of
his
generosity
and
putting
the
snuffbox
back
your
name
will
be
in
headlines
from
alabama
to
alberta
and
all
due
to
the
i
would
have
resented
this
as
a
gross
misappropriation
of
credit
for
surely
all
obligation
was
on
the
other
side
had
i
not
been
deeply
disturbed
by
the
prospect
of
being
haled
before
this
committee
like
a
criminal
before
the
bar
of
justice
i
much
rather
avoid
this
unpleasant
notoriety
mr
le
ffaçasé
i
protested
since
the
for
reasons
best
known
to
itself
chooses
not
to
avail
itself
of
my
contributions
but
prints
my
name
over
words
i
have
not
written
there
could
be
no
possible
objection
to
my
slipping
away
to
nevada
until
this
investigation
ends
his
face
became
a
pretty
shade
of
plum
weener
youre
a
thief
a
petty
cadging
sly
larcenous
pilfering
bloody
thief
you
take
the
honest
dollars
without
a
qualm
aye
with
a
smirk
on
your
imbecile
face
proposing
with
the
cool
impudence
of
the
born
embezzler
to
return
no
value
for
them
weener
you
forget
yourself
the
picked
you
out
of
a
gutter
a
nauseous
dungspattered
and
thoroughly
fitting
gutter
and
pays
you
well
mark
that
you
feebleminded
counterfeit
of
a
confidenceman
pays
you
well
not
for
your
futile
lecherous
pawings
at
the
chastity
of
the
english
language
but
out
of
the
boundless
generosity
which
only
a
newspaper
with
a
great
soul
can
have
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
in
gratitude
to
run
to
flee
to
hide
from
the
expression
of
authority
to
bring
disgrace
upon
the
very
newspaper
whose
munificence
pumps
life
into
your
boneless
soulless
gutless
carcass
not
another
word
not
a
sound
not
a
ghoulish
syllable
from
your
ineffective
vocabulary
out
of
my
presence
before
i
lose
my
temper
get
down
to
whatever
smokefilled
and
tastelessly
decorated
room
that
committee
is
meeting
in
and
do
not
leave
while
it
is
in
session
neither
to
eat
sleep
nor
move
those
bowels
whose
possession
i
gravely
doubt
you
hear
me
weener
for
some
reason
the
committee
was
not
attempting
to
get
the
story
of
the
grass
in
chronological
order
when
i
arrived
the
six
distinguished
gentlemen
were
trying
to
find
out
all
about
the
crudeoil
poured
apparently
without
effect
in
what
now
seemed
so
long
ago
but
which
actually
had
been
less
than
two
weeks
before
flanked
on
either
side
by
his
colleagues
the
little
black
plug
of
his
hearingaid
sticking
out
like
a
misplaced
unicorn
horn
was
the
chairman
senator
jones
his
looseskinned
old
fingers
resting
lightly
on
the
bright
table
the
nails
square
and
ridged
the
flesh
brownspotted
he
adjusted
a
pair
of
goldrimmed
spectacles
quickly
found
the
improvement
in
his
vision
unpleasant
and
rumbled
what
did
it
cost
the
taxpayers
on
the
stand
the
chief
of
police
was
settled
in
great
discomfort
so
far
forward
on
the
rounded
edge
of
his
chair
that
his
balance
was
a
source
of
fascinated
speculation
to
the
gallery
he
squirmed
a
perilous
half
inch
forward
but
before
he
had
time
to
reply
old
judge
robinson
of
the
state
supreme
court
who
scorned
any
palliation
of
his
deafness
such
as
senator
jones
condescended
to
cupped
his
left
ear
with
his
hand
and
shrieked
ay
ay
what
that
speak
up
ca
you
do
sit
there
mumbling
assemblyman
brown
head
of
the
legislature
antiracketeering
committee
intense
concentration
expressed
in
the
forward
push
of
his
vigorous
shoulders
and
the
creased
lines
on
his
youthful
forehead
asked
if
it
were
not
true
that
the
oil
had
been
held
up
by
a
union
jurisdictional
dispute
there
was
a
spattering
of
applause
from
the
listeners
at
this
adroit
question
and
one
man
in
the
back
of
the
room
cried
sha
and
then
sat
down
quickly
attorney
general
smith
wanted
to
know
just
who
had
ordered
the
oil
in
the
first
place
and
whether
the
propertyowners
had
given
their
consent
to
its
application
the
attorney
general
square
face
softened
and
rounded
by
fat
shone
on
the
wriggling
chief
like
a
klieglight
his
lips
irresistibly
suggesting
twin
slices
of
underdone
steak
parting
into
a
pleasant
smile
when
his
question
had
concluded
the
other
two
members
of
the
committee
seemed
about
to
inquire
further
when
the
chief
managed
to
stammer
he
was
awfully
sorry
gentlemen
but
he
had
been
out
of
town
and
hadnt
even
heard
of
the
oil
till
this
moment
he
was
instantly
dismissed
from
the
stand
and
a
new
witness
from
the
mayor
office
was
called
with
no
happier
results
he
too
was
about
to
be
excused
when
dr
johnson
who
represented
science
on
the
committee
descended
from
himalayan
abstraction
to
demand
what
effect
the
oil
had
had
on
the
grass
there
were
excited
whisperings
and
craning
of
feminine
heads
as
dr
johnson
propounded
his
question
the
interest
he
excited
was
however
largely
vicarious
for
he
was
famous
not
so
much
in
his
own
right
as
in
being
the
husband
of
the
widely
read
society
columnist
whose
malapropisms
caused
more
wry
enjoyment
and
fearsome
anticipation
than
an
elopement
to
nevada
and
what
effect
did
the
oil
have
on
the
grass
he
repeated
the
query
caused
confusion
for
it
seemed
the
committee
could
not
proceed
until
this
fact
had
been
ascertained
various
technicians
were
sent
for
and
the
doctor
tall
solemn
and
benign
looked
over
his
stiff
collar
and
the
black
string
tie
drooping
around
it
as
though
searching
for
some
profound
truth
which
would
be
readily
apparent
to
him
alone
the
experts
discoursed
at
some
length
in
esoteric
terms
one
even
bringing
a
portable
blackboard
on
which
he
demonstrated
with
diagrams
the
chemical
geologic
and
mathematical
aspects
of
the
problem
but
no
pertinent
information
was
forthcoming
till
some
minor
clerk
in
the
department
of
water
and
power
who
had
only
got
to
the
stand
through
a
confusion
of
names
said
boldly
no
effect
whatever
why
not
asked
judge
robinson
was
the
oil
adulterated
speak
up
speak
up
do
mumble
henry
miller
the
southland
bestknown
realtor
los
angeles
first
in
population
by
nineteen
ninety
nine
who
had
connections
in
the
oil
industry
as
well
as
in
citrus
and
walnut
packing
frowned
disapprovingly
the
clerk
said
he
didnt
know
but
he
might
venture
a
guess
senator
jones
informed
him
majestically
that
the
committee
was
concerned
with
facts
not
speculations
this
created
an
impasse
until
attorney
general
smith
tactfully
suggested
the
clerk
might
be
permitted
to
guess
entirely
off
the
record
after
the
official
stenographer
had
been
commanded
sternly
not
to
take
down
a
single
word
of
conjecture
the
witness
was
allowed
to
advance
the
opinion
that
the
oil
hadnt
killed
the
plant
because
it
had
never
reached
the
roots
ay
questioned
the
learned
judge
looking
as
though
neither
his
lunch
nor
breakfast
nor
for
that
matter
any
nourishment
absorbed
since
the
taft
administration
had
agreed
with
him
i
a
bit
of
a
gardener
myself
gentlemen
the
witness
assured
them
confidentially
settling
back
comfortably
i
putter
around
my
own
place
saturdays
and
sundays
and
i
know
what
devilgrass
is
like
i
can
well
imagine
a
bunch
of
it
twenty
or
twentyfive
feet
high
could
be
coated
with
many
many
gallons
of
oil
without
a
drop
seeping
down
into
the
ground
mr
miller
said
magisterially
not
really
good
american
oil
but
no
one
paid
attention
knowing
that
he
was
commenting
not
as
a
member
of
the
committee
but
in
his
other
capacity
as
the
head
of
an
organization
to
promote
brotherhood
and
democracy
by
deporting
all
foreignborn
and
the
descendants
of
foreignborn
to
their
original
countries
everyone
was
only
too
happy
to
have
the
oil
matter
concluded
at
any
cost
and
after
the
stenographer
was
ordered
to
resume
his
labors
the
next
witness
was
called
albert
weener
i
hope
i
may
never
again
have
to
submit
to
the
scrutiny
of
twelve
such
merciless
eyes
i
cast
my
own
down
at
the
brown
linoleum
until
every
stain
and
inkspot
was
impressed
ineradicably
on
my
mind
senator
jones
finally
broke
the
tension
by
asking
what
is
your
name
judge
robinson
enjoined
speak
up
speak
up
do
mumble
albert
weener
i
replied
there
was
a
faint
sigh
through
the
room
everyone
who
read
the
had
heard
of
me
and
what
is
your
occupation
mr
weener
asked
henry
miller
salesman
sir
i
answered
automatically
forgetting
my
present
connection
with
the
newspaper
and
he
smiled
at
me
sympathetically
you
belong
to
a
socalled
tradesunion
inquired
assemblyman
brown
i
will
ask
the
honorable
mr
brown
to
modify
his
question
by
having
the
word
struck
from
it
i
will
inform
the
honorable
attorney
general
that
my
question
stands
exactly
as
i
phrased
it
rejoined
assemblyman
brown
sharply
remind
the
attorney
general
i
myself
am
a
member
in
good
standing
of
a
legitimate
union
namely
the
international
brotherhood
of
embalmers
morticians
gravediggers
and
helpers
and
when
i
asked
the
witness
if
he
belonged
to
a
socalled
tradesunion
i
was
referring
to
any
one
of
those
groups
of
red
conspirators
who
attempt
to
strangle
the
economic
body
by
interfering
with
the
normal
course
of
business
and
mulcting
honest
citizens
of
tributary
dues
before
they
can
pursue
their
livelihoods
judge
robinson
cupped
his
ear
again
and
glared
at
me
speak
up
man
stop
mumbling
i
do
belong
to
any
union
i
answered
as
soon
as
there
was
a
chance
for
my
words
to
be
heard
senator
jones
took
a
notebook
from
his
pocket
consulted
it
put
it
back
scribbled
something
on
the
pad
in
front
of
him
tore
it
up
looked
at
his
notebook
again
and
asked
what
is
your
connection
with
this
um
grass
i
applied
miss
francis
metamorphizer
to
it
sir
i
answered
nonsense
said
judge
robinson
sharply
explain
yourself
demanded
attorney
general
smith
tell
us
just
what
this
stuff
is
and
how
you
applied
it
suggested
henry
miller
do
mumble
ordered
judge
robinson
i
sorry
gentlemen
i
do
know
exactly
what
it
is
youll
have
to
ask
miss
francis
that
but
senator
jones
interrupted
me
you
mean
to
say
you
applied
a
chemical
to
someone
lawn
a
piece
of
valuable
property
without
knowing
its
contents
he
asked
sternly
well
senator
i
began
do
you
habitually
act
in
this
irresponsible
manner
senator
i
do
you
understand
sir
that
consequences
necessarily
follow
actions
what
sort
of
world
would
this
be
if
everyone
rushed
around
blindly
using
things
of
whose
nature
they
were
completely
unaware
do
mumble
warned
judge
robinson
i
began
to
feel
very
low
indeed
and
could
only
say
haltingly
i
acted
in
good
faith
gentlemen
when
mr
miller
kindly
recommended
that
i
be
excused
since
i
had
evidently
given
all
the
information
at
my
command
subject
to
recall
growled
attorney
general
smith
oh
certainly
sir
certainly
agreed
mr
miller
and
i
was
thankfully
released
from
my
ordeal
josephine
spencer
francis
i
can
not
say
miss
francis
had
made
any
concessions
in
her
appearance
in
deference
to
the
committee
for
she
looked
as
though
she
had
come
straight
from
her
kitchen
a
suspicion
strengthened
by
the
strand
of
grass
she
carried
in
her
fingers
and
played
with
absently
throughout
she
appeared
quite
at
home
as
she
settled
herself
in
the
chair
scanning
with
the
greatest
interest
the
faces
of
the
committeemen
as
if
she
were
memorizing
each
feature
for
future
reference
the
honorable
body
returned
her
scrutiny
with
sharply
individual
emphasis
the
attorney
general
smiled
pleasantly
at
her
judge
robinson
looked
more
sour
than
ever
and
grunted
woman
mistake
senator
jones
bowed
toward
her
with
courtesy
assemblyman
brown
gave
her
a
sharp
onceover
mr
miller
pursed
his
lips
in
amusement
and
dr
johnson
gazed
at
her
in
horrified
fascination
senator
jones
bowed
for
a
second
time
and
inquired
her
name
he
received
the
information
and
chewed
it
meditatively
miss
francis
took
out
her
gold
toothpick
considered
the
etiquette
of
using
it
and
regretfully
put
it
away
in
time
to
hear
the
attorney
general
question
mrs
or
miss
francis
miss
she
replied
gruffly
senator
jones
drew
back
as
if
attacked
by
a
wasp
attorney
general
smith
said
hum
very
loudly
and
looked
at
assemblyman
brown
who
looked
blank
dr
johnson
nose
raised
itself
a
perceptible
inch
and
judge
robinson
sensing
a
sensation
among
his
colleagues
shouted
speak
up
madam
do
mumble
miller
who
hadnt
been
affected
inquired
what
is
your
occupation
miss
francis
agrostological
engineer
specializing
in
chemical
research
how
that
again
judge
robinson
managed
to
put
into
the
simple
gesture
of
cupping
his
ear
a
devastating
condemnation
of
miss
francis
women
in
general
science
and
presentday
society
she
politely
repeated
herself
astrology
what
that
got
to
do
with
the
grass
do
you
cast
horoscopes
agrostology
dr
johnson
murmured
to
the
ceiling
will
you
explain
please
in
simpler
terms
just
what
you
do
requested
attorney
general
smith
local
statutes
against
fortunetelling
burst
out
judge
robinson
i
have
spent
my
life
studying
reactions
of
plants
to
the
lighter
elements
and
the
effects
of
certain
compounds
on
their
growth
reproduction
and
metabolism
judge
robinson
removed
his
hand
from
behind
his
ear
and
rubbed
his
skull
irritably
assemblyman
brown
complained
there
entirely
too
much
talk
about
reaction
dr
johnson
inspected
a
paneled
wall
with
no
interest
whatever
and
senator
jones
stated
pontifically
you
are
an
agricultural
chemist
miss
francis
smiled
at
him
amiably
agriculture
is
a
broad
field
and
i
farm
one
small
corner
of
it
attorney
general
smith
leaned
forward
with
interest
from
what
university
did
you
obtain
your
degrees
miss
francis
she
slouched
back
comfortably
to
look
more
cylindrical
than
ever
none
she
stated
baldly
hay
mumble
senator
jones
said
i
afraid
i
did
not
quite
understand
your
reply
madam
i
hold
no
degrees
honors
or
diplomas
whatever
and
i
have
not
wasted
one
second
of
my
life
in
any
college
university
academy
or
other
alleged
institution
of
learning
the
degrees
good
enough
for
roger
bacon
erasmus
darwin
lavoisier
linnaeus
and
lamarck
are
good
enough
for
me
i
am
a
questioner
gentlemen
a

not
a
collector
of
alphabetical
letters
which
strung
together
in
any
form

fancy

continue
eternally
to
spell
nothing
whatever
sensation
one
of
the
experts
who
had
been
waiting
patiently
to
testify
folded
his
arms
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
this
is
what
comes
of
tolerating
women
in
the
professions
another
muttered
charlatan
ridiculous
dangerous
thing
shameful
sex
two
elderly
ladies
in
broadcloth
coats
with
fur
collars
later
identified
as
crusaders
for
antivivisection
cheered
feebly
and
were
promptly
ejected
senator
jones
took
off
his
spectacles
polished
them
exhaustively
tried
to
put
them
on
upside
down
gave
up
and
stated
gravely
this
is
an
extraordinary
admission
miss
um
francis
it
is
not
an
admission
at
all
it
is
a
statement
of
fact
as
for
its
irregularity
i
take
the
liberty
of
believing
we
unlettered
ones
are
in
the
majority
rather
than
minority
judge
robinson
warned
could
be
cited
for
contempt
miss
harrumph
dr
johnson
said
sharply
nonsense
madam
even
a
even
a
tree
surgeon
has
more
respect
for
learning
mr
miller
leaned
slightly
over
the
table
do
you
realize
that
in
your
ignorant
dabbling
you
have
ruined
hundreds
of
propertyowners
and
taxpayers
i
thought
there
was
some
law
against
practicing
without
a
license
speculated
assemblyman
brown
there
is
apparently
no
law
applying
intelligence
qualifications
for
members
of
the
legislature
remarked
miss
francis
pleasantly
senator
jones
lifted
his
gavel
idle
until
now
and
banged
it
on
the
table
smashing
his
spectacles
thoughtlessly
placed
in
front
of
him
a
moment
before
this
did
nothing
to
appease
his
rising
choler
silence
madam
we
have
perhaps
been
too
lenient
in
deference
to
your
um
sex
i
remind
you
that
this
body
is
vested
with
all
the
dignity
of
the
state
of
california
unless
you
apologize
instantly
i
shall
cite
you
for
contempt
i
beg
the
committee
pardon
the
investigators
held
a
whispered
conference
among
themselves
evidently
to
determine
whether
this
equivocal
apology
was
to
be
accepted
apparently
it
was
for
dr
johnson
now
asked
loftily
and
with
an
abstracted
air
as
though
he
already
knew
the
answer
and
considered
it
beneath
notice
what
was
this
magic
formula
you
caused
to
be
put
on
the
grass
malicious
spirits
averred
that
dickie
johnson
had
flunked
out
of
agricultural
school
had
an
obscure
european
diploma
and
that
his
fame
as
a
professor
at
creighton
university
was
based
on
the
gleaming
granite
and
stainless
steel
building
dedicated
to
research
in
agronomy
which
bore
the
legend
johnson
foundation
over
the
entrance
no
one
hearing
him
pronounce
magic
formula
putting
into
the
word
all
the
contempt
of
the
scientist
for
the
quack
could
ever
put
credence
in
the
base
slander
what
was
this
formula
you
caused
to
be
put
on
the
grass
he
repeated
miss
francis
reeled
off
a
list
of
elements
so
swiftly
i
sure
no
one
but
the
stenographer
caught
them
all
i
know
i
didnt
get
more
than
half
though
i
was
sitting
less
than
five
feet
from
her
magnesium
she
stated
iodine
carbon
nitrogen
hydrogen
helium
potash
sulphur
oxygen
dr
johnson
seemed
to
have
known
its
composition
since
grammarschool
days
senator
jones
asked
and
what
effect
did
you
expect
this
extraordinary
conglomeration
to
have
she
repeated
what
she
had
told
me
at
first
and
the
deductions
she
had
made
since
dr
johnson
smiled
a
true
man
of
science
he
stated
one
who
has
labored
for
years
to
acquire
those
degrees
you
affect
to
despise
would
have
been
trained
in
selfless
devotion
to
the
service
of
mankind
would
never
have
made
whatever
gross
error
your
ignorance
heightened
by
projection
into
a
sphere
for
which
you
are
probably
biologically
unfitted
though
this
is
perhaps
controversial
has
betrayed
you
into
for
had
you
freely
shared
your
work
with
colleagues
they
would
have
been
able
to
correct
your
mistakes
and
this
catastrophe
brought
on
by
selfish
greed
a
catastrophe
which
has
already
cost
millions
would
not
have
occurred
the
entire
committee
including
dr
johnson
himself
seemed
pleased
with
this
indictment
attorney
general
smith
looked
inquiringly
at
the
witness
as
though
inviting
her
to
answer
if
she
could
miss
francis
evidently
took
the
invitation
literally
for
she
addressed
herself
directly
to
dr
johnson
i
do
not
know
doctor
where
these
beautiful
and
eminently
sensible
ideals
you
have
so
eloquently
outlined
are
practiced
where
scientists
regardless
of
biological
fitness
share
with
each
other
their
advances
from
moment
to
moment
and
so
add
to
the
security
of
civilization
from
day
to
day
is
it
in
the
great
research
foundations
whose
unlimited
funds
are
used
to
lure
promising
young
men
to
their
staffs
much
as
athletes
used
to
be
given
scholarships
by
universities
anxious
to
improve
the
physical
qualities
of
american
youth
is
it
in
the
experimental
laboratories
of
great
industries
where
technological
advances
are
daily
suppressed
locked
away
in
safes
so
profits
may
not
be
diminished
by
the
expensive
retooling
necessary
to
put
these
advances
into
effect
or
is
it
in
a
field
closer
to
my
own
in
chemical
research
pure
science
if
you
like
where
truly
secrets
are
shared
on
an
international
scale
in
order
to
build
up
the
cartels
which
choke
production
by
increasing
prices
and
promote
those
industries
which
thrive

international
illwill
assemblyman
brown
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
in
measured
tones
this
woman
is
a
paid
agent
of
the
communist
international
i
have
heard
such
rantings
from
demagogues
on
streetcorners
i
demand
the
committee
listen
to
no
more
of
this
propaganda
mr
miller
gave
a
polite
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
assemblyman
indicating
at
once
full
agreement
with
what
the
legislator
said
and
apology
for
pursuing
his
questioning
of
miss
francis
he
then
asked
the
witness
sternly
what
is
your
real
name
i
afraid
i
do
quite
understand
the
only
name
i
have
is
josephine
spencer
francis
and
so
far
as
i
know
it
is
thus
written
on
my
birth
certificate
birth
certificate
ay
where
were
you
born
speak
up
do
mumble
russia
without
a
doubt
muttered
assemblyman
brown
youre
sure
it
isnt
franciski
or
franciscovitch
or
say
finklestein
my
name
is
not
finkelstein
although
i
do
not
find
myself
terrified
of
that
combination
of
syllables
i
was
born
in
moscow
another
sensation
i
thought
so
screamed
judge
robinson
triumphantly
aha
exclaimed
senator
jones
profoundly
the
leopard
doesnt
change
his
spots
or
the
red
his
or
her
color
asserted
assemblyman
brown
a
sabatoor
yelled
several
of
the
spectators
only
dr
johnson
seemed
unimpressed
with
the
revelation
he
smiled
in
moscow
idaho
concluded
miss
francis
picking
her
teeth
with
a
flourish
judge
robinson
screeched
ay
ay
what
all
this
hubbub
assemblyman
brown
sneered
a
very
unlikely
story
attorney
general
smith
wanted
it
proven
in
blackandwhite
while
senator
jones
remarked
miss
francis
taste
was
on
a
level
with
her
scholarship
she
waved
the
toothpick
toward
the
chairman
and
politely
waited
for
either
further
questions
or
dismissal
all
the
while
her
intense
interest
in
each
gesture
of
the
inquisitors
and
every
facet
of
the
investigation
had
not
diminished
at
all
as
she
sat
there
patiently
her
eyes
darted
from
one
to
the
other
as
they
consulted
and
only
came
to
rest
on
senator
jones
when
he
spoke
directly
to
her
again
and
what
steps
can
you
take
to
undo
hum
this
so
far
none
admitted
miss
francis
but
since
this
thing
has
happened
i
have
given
all
my
time
to
experiment
hoping
in
some
manner
to
reverse
the
action
of
the
metamorphizer
and
evolve
a
formula
whereby
the
growth
it
induced
will
be
inhibited
i
can
not
say
i
am
even
on
the
right
road
yet
for
you
must
recall
i
have
spent
my
adult
life
going
as
it
were
in
one
direction
and
it
is
now
not
a
matter
of
merely
retracing
my
steps
but
of
starting
out
for
an
entirely
different
destination
in
a
field
where
there
are
no
highwaymaps
and
few
compasspoints
i
can
not
say
i
am
even
optimistic
of
success
but
it
is
not
for
want
of
trying
be
assured
of
that
another
semisilence
while
the
committee
conferred
once
more
finally
senator
jones
spoke
in
grave
and
measured
tones
it
is
a
customary
politeness
in
hearings
of
this
nature
to
thank
the
witness
for
his
helpfulness
and
cooperation
this
courtesy
i
can
not
with
any
sincerity
extend
to
you
madam
it
seems
to
me
you
have
proven
yourself
the
opposite
of
a
good
citizen
that
you
have
set
yourself
up
in
your
arrogance
against
all
logical
authority
and
have
presumed
to
look
down
upon
the
work
and
methods
of
men
whose
standing
and
ways
of
procedure
are
recognized
by
all
sound
people
by
your
conceit
madam
you
have
caused
the
death
of
young
men
the
flower
of
our
state
manhood
who
gave
their
lives
in
a
vain
attempt
to
destroy
what
your
ignorance
created
if
i
may
be
permitted
a
rather
daring
and
perhaps
harsh
aside
i
think
this
should
strike
you
doubly
as
a
woman
who
has
not
brought
forth
offspring
to
carry
on
the
work
of
our
forefathers
and
as
one
who
with
doubtful
taste
boasts
of
that
sterility
i
think
the
results
of
your
socalled
experiments
should
chasten
you
and
make
you
heed
the
words
of
men
properly
qualified
in
a
field
where
you
are
clearly
not
so
someone
in
the
back
of
the
room
applauded
the
senator
eloquence
senator
jones
said
miss
francis
turning
her
eyes
on
him
with
the
attention
i
knew
so
well
the
look
which
meant
she
had
found
an
interest
for
the
moment
excluding
all
others
you
accuse
me
of
what
amounts
to
crime
or
at
least
criminal
folly
and
i
must
answer
that
your
accusations
are
at
once
both
true
and
false
i
have
been
foolish
but
it
was
not
in
despising
the
constrictions
and
falsity
of
the
academic
world
i
flouted
authority
but
it
was
not
the
authority
of
the
movingpicture
heroes
whose
comic
errors
are
perpetuated
for
generations
like
those
of
pasteur
or
so
quietly
repudiated
their
repudiation
passes
unnoticed
like
those
of
lister
in
order
to
protect
a
vested
interest
the
authority
i
have
flouted
in
my
arrogance
as
you
call
it
is
that
authority
all
scientists
recognized
in
the
days
when
science
was
scientific
and
called
itself
not
boastfully
by
the
name
of
all
knowledge
but
more
humbly
and
decently
natural
philosophy
that
authority
is
what
theologians
term
the
will
of
god
others
the
life
force
the
immaterial
principle
the
common
unconscious
or
whatever
you
will
when
i
along
with
all
the
academic
robots
whom
you
admire
denied
that
authority
we
did
not
make
ourselves
as
we
thought
men
of
pure
science
but
on
the
contrary
by
deposing
one
master
we
invited
in
a
horde
of
others
since
we
could
not
submit
to
moral
force
we
submitted
in
our
blind
stupidity
we
called
it
the
rejection
of
metaphysical
concepts
to
financial
force
to
political
force
to
social
force
and
finally
since
there
was
no
longer
any
reward
in
itself
for
our
speculations
we
submitted
to
the
lust
for
personal
aggrandizement
in
fortune
in
notoriety
in
castebound
irresponsibility
and
even
for
the
hypocritical
backslapping
of
our
fellows
in
the
counterrevolution
known
as
the
nineteenth
century
we
even
repudiated
the
name
of
speculation
and
it
became
a
term
of
disrepute
like
metaphysical
we
went
further
than
a
mere
disavowal
of
the
name
we
disavowed
the
whole
process
and
turned
with
disgust
from
the
using
of
our
minds
to
the
use
of
our
hands
in
a
manner
which
would
have
revolted
the
most
illiterate
of
carpathian
peasants
we
extirpated
the
salivary
glands
of
dogs
in
order
to
find
out
if
they
would
slobber
without
them
we
cut
off
the
tails
of
mice
to
discover
if
the
operation
affected
their
greatgrandchildren
we
decapitated
emasculated
malnourished
and
poisoned
rodents
against
whom
we
had
no
personal
animus
for
no
other
reason
than
to
keep
an
elaborate
apparatus
in
use
even
these
pastimes
failed
to
satisfy
our
undiscriminating
appetite
someone
a
little
stupider
a
little
less
imaginative
though
such
conditions
must
have
been
difficult
indeed
to
achieve
invented
what
is
called
the
control
experiment
whereby
if
theory
tested
be
correct
half
the
subjects
are
condemned
without
trial
to
execution
these
are
my
sins
that
in
despising
academic
ends
i
did
not
despise
academic
means
that
in
repudiating
the
brainlessness
of
the
professorial
mind
i
did
not
attempt
to
use
my
own
because
i
was
proud
of
the
integrity
which
made
me
choose
not
to
do
the
will
of
a
research
foundation
or
industrial
empire
i
overlooked
the
vital
fact
that
i
had
also
chosen
not
to
do
god
will
but
what
i
stupidly
thought
to
be
my
own
it
was
not
it
was
faintheartedness
sloth
placation
doubt
vagueness
and
romantical
misconception
in
a
word
it
was
the
aimlessness
and
falsity
of
the
nineteenth
century
coming
back
in
the
window
after
having
been
booted
out
the
door
my
folly
was
the
failure
to
recognize
it
i
have
deluded
myself
i
have
taken
halfmeasures
i
have
followed
false
paths
condemn
me
for
these
crimes
i
am
guilty
attorney
general
smith
said
acidly
this
is
neither
a
consulting
room
a
confessional
nor
a
court
of
law
i
suggest
the
witness
be
excused
and
her
last
hysterical
remarks
expunged
from
the
record
it
is
so
ordered
ruled
senator
jones
and
now
gentlemen
we
shall
recess
until
tomorrow
three
triumphant
the
hearings
of
the
committee
to
investigate
dangerous
vegetation
went
on
for
five
days
and
mr
le
ffaçasé
was
increasingly
delighted
as
the
proceedings
went
down
properly
edited
and
embellished
to
excite
reader
interest
in
the
columns
of
the
he
even
unbent
so
far
as
to
call
me
a
fool
without
any
adjectival
modification
which
was
for
him
the
height
of
geniality
i
do
want
to
give
the
impression
the
committee
stole
the
show
as
the
saying
goes
the
show
essentially
and
primarily
was
still
the
grass
itself
it
grew
while
the
honorable
body
inquired
and
it
grew
while
the
honorable
body
tired
by
its
labors
slept
it
increased
during
the
speeches
of
senator
jones
through
the
interjections
of
judge
robinson
and
as
dr
johnson
added
his
wisdom
to
the
deliberations
while
the
committee
probed
listened
and
digested
the
grass
finally
pushed
its
way
across
hollywood
boulevard
resisting
frantic
efforts
by
the
national
guard
the
fire
and
police
departments
and
a
volunteer
brigade
of
local
merchants
to
stem
its
course
it
defied
alike
sharpened
steel
fire
chemicals
and
explosives
even
the
smallest
runner
could
now
be
severed
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
for
in
its
advance
the
weed
had
toughened
some
said
because
of
its
omnivorous
diet
others
its
ability
to
absorb
nitrogen
from
the
air
and
its
rubbery
quality
caused
it
to
yield
to
onslaught
only
to
bound
back
apparently
uninjured
after
each
blow
one
of
the
most
disquieting
aspects
of
the
advance
was
its
variability
and
unpredictability
to
the
west
it
had
hardly
gone
five
blocks
from
the
dinkman
house
while
southward
it
had
crossed
santa
monica
boulevard
and
was
nosing
toward
melrose
its
growth
had
been
measured
and
checked
over
and
over
again
but
the
figures
were
never
constant
some
days
it
traveled
a
foot
an
hour
on
others
it
leapt
nearly
a
city
block
between
sunrise
and
nightfall
it
is
simple
to
put
down
the
grass
crossed
hollywood
boulevard
as
simple
as
saying
our
troops
advanced
or
the
man
was
hanged
at
dawn
but
when
i
write
these
words
less
than
a
generation
later
surrounded
by
rolling
hills
gentle
brooks
and
vast
lawns
sedate
and
tame
i
can
close
my
eyes
and
see
again
the
green
glacier
crawling
down
the
sidestreets
and
over
the
low
roofs
of
the
shops
to
pour
like
a
cascade
upon
the
busy
artery
once
more
i
can
feel
the
crawling
of
my
skin
as
i
looked
upon
the
methodical
obliteration
of
men
work
i
can
see
the
tendrils
splaying
out
over
the
sidewalks
choking
the
roadways
climbing
walls
finding
vulnerable
chinks
in
masonry
bunching
themselves
inside
apertures
and
bursting
out
carrying
with
them
fragments
of
their
momentary
prison
as
they
pursued
their
ruthless
course
now
the
uproar
and
clamor
of
a
disturbed
public
swelled
to
giant
volume
all
the
disruption
and
distress
going
before
had
been
news
this
was
disaster
all
same
glauman
chinese
all
same
remarked
gootes
and
indeed
i
have
heard
far
less
outcry
over
the
destruction
of
historic
landmarks
than
was
raised
when
the
grass
obscured
the
celebrated
footprints
recall
of
the
mayor
was
demanded
and
councilmen
official
limousines
were
frequently
overturned
meetings
denounced
the
inaction
of
the
authorities
a
gigantic
parade
bearing
placards
calling
for
an
end
to
procrastination
marched
past
the
cityhall
democrats
blamed
republicans
for
inefficiency
and
republicans
retorted
that
miss
francis
had
done
her
research
during
a
democratic
administration
every
means
previously
tried
and
found
wanting
was
tried
again
as
though
it
were
impossible
for
human
minds
to
acknowledge
defeat
by
an
insensate
plant
the
axes
the
scythes
weedburners
and
reapers
were
brought
out
again
only
to
prove
their
inability
to
cope
with
the
relentless
flow
of
the
grass
robot
tanks
loaded
with
explosives
disappeared
as
had
those
containing
the
soldiers
and
only
the
stifled
sound
of
their
explosion
registered
the
fact
that
they
had
fulfilled
their
design
if
not
their
purpose
it
was
difficult
for
the
man
on
the
street
to
understand
how
the
weapons
successful
in
normandy
and
tarawa
could
be
balked
by
vegetation
like
the
investigating
committee
pursuit
of
the
question
of
the
adulteration
they
wanted
to
know
if
the
tanks
were
firstline
vehicles
or
some
surplus
palmed
off
by
the
war
department
if
the
weedburners
were
properly
accredited
graminicides
or
just
a
bunch
of
bums
taken
from
the
reliefrolls
the
necessary
reverse
of
this
picture
was
the
jubilant
hailing
of
each
new
instrument
of
attack
the
brief
but
hysterical
enthusiasm
for
each
in
turn
as
the
ultimate
savior
because
of
my
unique
position
i
witnessed
the
trial
of
them
all
i
saw
tanks
dragging
rotary
plows
and
others
equipped
with
devices
like
electricfans
but
with
blades
of
hardened
steel
sharpened
to
razor
keenness
the
only
thing
this
latter
gadget
did
was
to
scatter
more
potential
nuclei
to
the
accommodating
wind
i
saw
the
flammenwerfer
the
dreadful
flamethrowers
which
had
scorched
the
bodies
of
men
like
burnt
toast
in
an
instant
direct
their
concentrated
fire
upon
the
advancing
runners
i
smelled
the
sweetly
sick
smell
of
steaming
sap
and
saw
the
runners
shrivel
and
curl
back
as
they
had
done
on
other
occasions
until
nothing
was
presented
to
the
flamethrowers
except
the
tangled
mass
of
interwoven
stems
denuded
of
all
foliage
upon
this
involved
wall
the
fire
had
no
effect
the
stems
did
not
wilt
the
hard
membranes
did
not
collapse
the
steely
network
did
not
retreat
it
seemed
a
drawn
battle
in
one
small
sector
yet
in
that
very
part
where
the
grass
paused
on
the
ground
it
rose
higher
into
the
air
like
a
poising
tidalwave
higher
and
higher
until
its
crest
unbalanced
toppled
forward
to
engulf
its
tormentors
then
the
unruffled
advance
resumed
again
some
resource
was
interposed
against
it
again
it
was
checked
for
an
instant
and
again
it
overcame
its
adversary
careless
of
obstacles
impartially
taking
to
itself
gouty
roominghouses
and
pimping
frenchprovincial
master
bedrooms
chateaus
hotdogstand
and
brown
derby
cornergrocery
and
pyramidal
foodmart
undeterred
by
anything
in
its
path
when
you
say
a
clump
of
weed
attacked
a
city
you
utter
an
absurdity
i
think
everyone
was
aware
of
the
fantastic
discrepancy
between
statement
of
the
event
and
the
event
itself
so
innocent
and
ridiculous
the
grass
looked
as
it
made
its
first
tentative
thrust
at
the
urban
nerves
the
green
blades
sloped
forward
like
some
prettily
arranged
but
unimaginative
corsage
upon
the
concrete
bosom
of
the
street
you
could
not
believe
those
fragile
seeming
strands
would
resist
the
impress
of
a
careless
boot
much
less
the
entire
arsenal
of
military
and
agricultural
implements
it
must
have
been
this
deceptive
fragility
which
broke
the
spirit
of
so
many
people
from
an
item
in
the
i
recalled
the
existence
of
one
of
mrs
dinkman
neighbors
who
had
rudely
refused
the
opportunity
to
have
his
lawn
treated
with
the
metamorphizer
he
had
left
an
incoherent
suicidenote
pigeons
in
the
grass
alas
too
many
pigeons
too
much
grass
pigeons
are
doves
but
noah
expressed
a
raven
contradiction
lies
roses
are
red
violets
are
blue
the
grass
is
green
and
i
am
thru
too
too
too
darling
kiddies
he
then
in
full
view
of
the
helpless
weedfighters
marched
on
into
the
grass
and
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
days
following
so
many
selfdestructions
succeeded
this
one
that
the
grass
became
known
in
the
papers
as
the
green
horror
perhaps
a
peculiar
sidelight
on
human
oddity
was
revealed
in
most
of
these
suicides
choosing
to
immolate
themselves
not
in
the
main
body
of
the
grass
but
in
one
of
the
many
smaller
nuclei
springing
up
in
close
proximity
it
was
my
fortune
to
witness
the
confluence
of
two
of
these
descendant
bodies
they
had
come
into
being
only
a
few
blocks
apart
understandably
their
true
character
was
unrecognized
until
they
were
out
of
control
and
had
enveloped
the
neighborhoods
of
their
origin
they
crept
toward
each
other
with
a
sort
of
incestuous
attraction
until
mere
yards
separated
them
they
paused
skittishly
the
runners
crawled
forward
speculatively
the
green
fronds
began
overlapping
like
clasping
fingers
then
with
accelerating
speed
came
together
much
as
a
pack
of
cards
in
the
hands
of
a
deft
shuffler
slides
edge
under
edge
to
make
a
compact
and
indivisible
whole
the
line
of
division
disappeared
the
two
became
one
and
where
before
there
had
been
left
a
narrow
path
for
men
to
tread
now
only
a
serene
line
of
vegetation
outlined
itself
against
the
unblinking
sky
i
have
said
mr
le
ffaçasé
had
softened
his
brutality
toward
me
but
his
favor
did
not
extend
so
pervasive
is
literary
jealousy
to
printing
my
own
reports
he
continued
to
subject
me
to
the
indignity
of
being
ghosted
a
thoroughly
expressive
term
which
by
a
combination
of
bad
conjugation
and
the
suggestion
of
insubstantiality
defines
the
sort
of
prose
produced
by
jacson
gootes
this
arrangement
instead
of
giving
me
some
freedom
shackled
me
to
the
reporter
who
dashed
from
celebrity
to
celebrity
grass
to
nuclei
office
to
point
of
momentary
interest
with
unflagging
energy
and
infuriating
jocosity
i
knew
his
repertory
of
tricks
and
accents
down
to
the
last
yawn
most
of
all
i
resented
his
irregular
habits
he
never
arrived
at
the
office
on
time
or
quit
after
a
proper
day
work
he
thought
nothing
of
getting
me
out
of
bed
before
i
had
my
eight
sleep
to
accompany
him
on
some
ridiculous
errand
bertie
old
dormouse
the
grass
is
knocking
at
the
doors
of
nbc
all
right
i
answered
annoyed
it
started
down
vine
street
yesterday
it
would
be
more
surprising
if
it
obligingly
paused
before
the
studios
cynic
he
said
pulling
the
bedclothes
away
from
my
face
i
consider
this
the
lowest
form
of
horseplay
i
know
of
how
quickly
your
ideals
have
been
tarnished
by
contact
with
the
vulgar
world
of
newspaperdom
front
and
center
bertie
lad
we
must
catch
the
grass
making
its
own
soundeffects
before
they
jerk
out
the
microphones
protests
having
no
effect
i
reluctantly
went
with
him
but
the
scene
was
merely
a
repetition
of
hundreds
of
previous
ones
the
grass
being
no
more
or
less
spectacular
for
nbc
than
for
watanabe
nursery
and
cut
flower
shop
a
halfmile
away
its
aftereffects
however
were
immediate
the
governor
declared
martial
law
in
los
angeles
county
and
ordered
the
evacuation
of
an
area
five
miles
wide
on
the
perimeter
of
the
grass
furious
cries
of
anguish
went
up
from
those
affected
by
the
arbitrary
order
what
authority
had
any
official
to
dispossess
honest
people
from
their
homes
in
times
of
peace
the
right
to
hold
their
property
unmolested
was
a
prerogative
vested
in
the
humblest
american
and
who
was
the
governor
to
abrogate
the
constitution
the
declaration
of
independence
and
manifold
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
in
embittered
fury
henry
miller
resigned
from
the
investigating
committee
now
defunct
anyway
its
voluminous
and
inconclusive
report
buried
in
the
state
archives
injunctions
issued
from
local
courts
like
ashes
from
a
stirring
volcano
but
the
militia
were
impervious
and
hustled
the
freeholders
from
their
homes
with
callous
disregard
for
the
sacred
dues
of
property
when
the
reason
behind
this
evacuation
order
leaked
out
a
still
greater
lamentation
was
evoked
for
the
national
guard
was
planning
nothing
less
than
a
saturation
incendiary
bombing
of
the
entire
area
the
bludgeon
which
reduced
the
cities
of
europe
to
mere
shells
must
surely
destroy
this
new
invader
even
the
stoutest
defenders
of
property
conceded
this
must
be
so
but
what
was
the
point
of
annihilating
the
enemy
if
their
holdings
were
to
be
sacrificed
in
the
process
no
no
let
the
governor
take
whatever
means
he
pleased
to
dispatch
the
weed
so
long
as
the
method
involved
left
them
homes
to
enjoy
when
things
were
as
they
inevitably
must
be
restored
to
normal
so
frantic
were
their
efforts
that
the
supreme
court
actually
forced
the
governor
to
postpone
his
proposed
bombing
though
it
did
not
discontinue
the
evacuation
there
were
few
indeed
who
understood
how
the
weed
would
digest
the
very
wood
bricks
or
stucco
and
who
packed
up
and
moved
out
ahead
of
the
troops
american
flags
and
shotguns
recalled
the
heroic
days
of
the
frontier
and
defiance
of
the
governor
edict
was
the
rule
instead
of
the
exception
fierce
old
ladies
dared
the
militiamen
to
lay
a
finger
on
them
or
their
possessions
and
apoplectic
gentlemen
eyes
as
glazed
as
those
of
the
huntingtrophies
on
their
walls
sputtered
refusals
to
stir
no
not
for
all
the
brutal
force
in
the
world
no
one
was
seriously
hurt
in
this
rebellion
the
commonest
wound
being
long
scratches
on
the
cheeks
of
the
guardsmen
inflicted
by
feminine
nails
as
with
various
degrees
of
resistance
the
inhabitants
were
carried
or
shooed
from
their
dwellings
while
the
wrangling
over
its
destruction
went
on
the
grass
continued
its
progress
out
through
cahuenga
pass
it
flowed
toward
fertile
san
fernando
valley
steadily
it
climbed
to
the
hilltops
masticating
sage
greasewood
oak
sycamore
and
manzanita
with
the
same
ease
it
bolted
houses
and
pavements
into
griffith
park
it
swaggered
mumbling
the
planetarium
mount
hollywood
and
fern
dell
in
successive
mouthfuls
and
swarmed
down
to
the
concretelined
bed
of
the
los
angeles
river
here
ineffectual
shallow
pools
had
preserved
illusion
and
given
tourists
something
at
which
to
laugh
in
the
dry
season
the
weed
licked
them
up
like
a
thirsty
cow
at
a
wallow
up
and
down
and
over
the
river
it
ran
each
day
with
greater
speed
it
broke
into
the
watermains
it
tore
down
the
poles
bearing
electric
telephone
and
telegraph
wires
it
forced
its
way
between
the
threaded
joints
of
gaspipes
and
turned
their
lethal
vapor
loose
in
the
air
until
all
services
in
the
vicinity
were
hastily
discontinued
short
weeks
after
i
inoculated
mrs
dinkman
lawn
that
part
of
los
angeles
known
as
hollywood
had
disappeared
from
the
map
of
civilization
and
had
become
one
solid
mass
of
green
devilgrass
no
one
refused
to
move
for
this
dispossessor
as
they
had
for
the
governor
thousands
of
homeless
fled
from
it
their
going
clogged
the
highways
with
automobiles
and
produced
an
artificial
gasoline
shortage
reminiscent
of
wartime
in
downtown
los
angeles
freightcars
stood
unloaded
on
their
sidings
their
consignees
out
of
business
and
the
warehouses
glutted
the
strain
on
local
transportation
already
enfeebled
by
a
publicservice
system
designed
for
a
city
one
twentieth
its
size
and
a
complete
lack
of
those
facilities
mandatory
in
every
other
large
center
of
population
increased
by
the
necessary
rerouting
around
the
affected
area
threatened
disruption
of
the
entire
organism
and
the
further
disintegration
of
the
city
already
weakened
coordination
the
values
of
realestate
dropped
houses
were
sold
for
a
song
officebuildings
for
an
aria
hotels
for
a
chorus
the
san
francisco
chamber
of
commerce
secure
in
the
knowledge
its
city
suffered
from
nothing
worse
than
fires
earthquakes
a
miserable
climate
and
an
invincible
provincialism
invited
displaced
businessmen
to
resettle
themselves
in
an
area
where
improbable
happenings
were
less
likely
and
the
state
of
oklahoma
organized
a
border
patrol
to
keep
out
californians
i
could
not
blame
the
realestate
men
for
attempting
to
unload
their
holdings
before
they
suffered
the
fate
of
one
tall
building
at
hollywood
and
highland
the
grass
closed
about
its
base
like
a
false
foundation
and
surged
on
to
new
conquests
leaving
the
monolith
bare
and
forlorn
in
its
new
surroundings
at
first
the
weed
satisfied
itself
with
jocular
and
teasing
ventures
up
the
smooth
sides
then
as
though
rasped
by
the
skyscraper
quiescence
it
forced
its
way
into
the
narrow
space
between
the
steel
sash
filling
the
lower
floor
and
bursting
out
again
in
a
riot
of
whirling
tendrils
up
the
sides
it
climbed
like
some
false
ivy
clinging
falling
back
building
upon
its
own
defeated
body
until
it
reached
another
story
and
another
and
another
at
each
one
the
tale
was
repeated
windows
burglariously
forced
a
floor
suffocated
egress
effected
and
another
height
of
wall
scaled
at
the
end
the
proud
structure
was
a
lonely
obelisk
furred
in
a
green
covering
to
the
very
flagpole
on
its
peak
from
which
waved
disappointed
yet
still
aspiring
runners
upward
and
outward
continuously
empty
lot
fillingstation
artistic
billboard
all
alike
to
the
greedy
fingers
like
thumb
and
index
they
formed
a
crescent
a
threatening
semicircle
reaching
forward
by
indirection
northward
and
southeastward
the
two
aqueducts
kept
the
desert
from
reclaiming
its
own
for
fifty
years
the
city
had
scraped
up
bought
pilfered
or
systematically
robbed
all
the
water
it
could
get
through
the
gray
wet
lines
siphons
opencuts
pumps
lifts
tunnels
the
metropolis
sucked
life
now
the
desert
had
an
ally
the
grassy
fingers
avoided
the
downtown
district
feeling
purposefully
and
dangerously
toward
the
aqueducts
i
spent
much
of
my
time
when
not
actively
watching
the
grass
in
the
office
i
had
now
agreed
to
write
articles
for
several
weekly
magazines
and
though
they
edited
my
copy
with
a
heavy
and
unappreciative
hand
still
they
never
outraged
me
as
le
ffaçasé
did
by
causing
another
man
to
usurp
my
name
since
i
was
in
both
senses
nominally
a
member
of
the
staff
i
had
no
qualms
about
using
the
journal
typewriters
and
stationery
for
the
construction
of
little
essays
on
the
grass
as
seen
through
the
eyes
of
one
who
had
cause
to
know
it
better
than
anyone
else
curse
of
be
upon
the
head
of
that
man
controls
this
rolled
out
gootes
in
pseudochurchillian
tones
monster
has
woven
a
web
we
summoned
bertie
i
got
up
resignedly
and
followed
him
to
the
managingeditor
office
we
were
not
greeted
directly
instead
a
question
was
thrown
furiously
over
our
heads
where
is
he
what
bristling
and
baseless
egomania
sways
him
to
affront
the
with
his
contumacious
and
indecent
unpunctuality
who
chief
asked
gootes
le
ffaçasé
ignored
him
when
this
great
newspaper
condescends
to
shed
the
light
of
acceptance
to
say
nothing
of
an
obese
and
taxable
paycheck
upon
the
gross
corpus
of
an
illiterate
moviecameraman
a
false
daguerre
a
spurious
steichen
a
dubious
eisenstein
it
has
a
right
to
expect
a
return
for
the
goods
showered
upon
such
a
deceitful
sluggard
still
ignoring
gootes
he
turned
to
me
and
apparently
putting
the
berated
one
from
his
mind
went
on
with
comparative
mildness
weener
an
unparalleled
experience
is
to
fall
to
your
lot
you
have
not
achieved
this
opportunity
through
any
excellence
of
your
own
for
i
must
say
after
lengthy
contact
no
vestige
of
merit
in
you
is
perceptible
either
to
the
nude
eye
or
through
an
ultramicroscope
nevertheless
by
pure
unhappy
chance
you
are
the
property
of
the
and
as
such
this
illustrious
organ
intends
to
confer
upon
you
the
signal
honor
of
being
a
columbus
a
van
diemen
an
amundsen
you
weener
in
your
unworthy
person
shall
be
the
first
man
to
set
foot
upon
a
virgin
land
this
speech
being
no
more
comprehensible
to
me
than
his
excoriation
of
an
unknown
individual
i
could
only
stay
silent
and
try
to
look
appreciative
yes
weener
you
some
refugee
from
the
busy
newsroom
of
the
zwingle
iowa
a
disdainful
handwave
referred
this
description
to
gootes
some
miserable
castoff
from
a
fourthrate
quickie
studio
masquerading
as
a
newscameraman
and
a
party
of
sheep
perhaps
i
could
simplify
my
whole
sentence
by
saying
merely
a
party
of
bloody
sheep
will
be
landed
by
parachute
on
top
of
the
grass
this
very
afternoon
he
smacked
his
lips
i
can
see
tomorrow
bannerline
now
of
destruction
views
handiwork
should
you
chance
to
survive
your
ghostwritten
impressions
for
which
we
pay
too
high
a
price
far
too
high
a
price
will
become
doubly
valuable
should
you
come
as
i
confidently
expect
to
a
logical
conclusion
the
will
supply
a
suitable
obituary
now
get
the
bloody
hell
out
of
here
and
either
let
me
see
you
never
again
or
as
a
triumphant
balboa
who
has
sat
if
not
upon
a
peak
in
darien
at
least
upon
something
more
important
than
your
own
backside
the
inside
of
the
converted
armybomber
smelled
like
exactly
what
it
was
a
barn
ten
sheep
and
a
solitary
goat
were
tethered
to
stanchions
along
the
sides
the
sheep
bleated
continuously
the
goat
looked
cynically
forbearing
and
all
gave
off
an
ammoniacal
smell
which
was
not
absorbed
by
the
bed
of
hay
under
their
hoofs
enthusiasm
for
this
venture
was
an
emotion
i
found
practically
impossible
to
summon
up
even
without
le
ffaçasé
sanguinary
prophecies
i
objected
to
the
trip
i
had
never
been
in
a
plane
in
my
life
and
this
for
no
other
reason
than
disinclination
i
feared
every
possible
consequence
of
the
parachutejump
from
instant
annihilation
through
a
broken
neck
in
the
jerk
of
its
opening
down
to
being
smothered
in
its
folds
on
the
ground
i
distinctly
did
not
want
to
go
but
caution
sometimes
defeats
itself
i
was
so
afraid
of
going
that
i
hesitated
to
admit
my
timidity
and
so
i
found
myself
herded
with
my
two
companions
the
pilot
and
crew
in
with
the
sheep
and
the
goat
i
was
not
resigned
but
i
was
quiescent
gootes
and
the
animals
were
not
while
we
waited
he
went
through
his
entire
stock
of
tricks
including
a
few
new
ones
which
were
not
completely
successful
before
the
cameraman
panting
arrived
ten
minutes
after
our
scheduled
departure
his
name
was
rafe
slafe
which
i
thought
an
improbable
combination
of
syllables
and
he
was
so
chubby
in
every
part
you
imagined
you
saw
the
smile
which
ought
to
have
gone
with
such
a
face
and
figure
before
his
breath
had
settled
down
to
a
normal
routine
gootes
had
rushed
upon
him
with
an
enthusiastic
ah
rafello
muchacho
give
to
me
the
abrazo
como
usted
compañero
slafe
scorned
reply
pushing
gootes
aside
with
one
plump
hand
while
with
the
other
he
tidied
the
sparse
black
hairs
of
his
mustache
which
was
trimmed
down
to
an
eyebrow
shading
his
lip
after
inspecting
and
rejecting
several
identical
bucketseats
he
found
one
less
to
his
distaste
than
the
others
and
stowed
his
equipment
which
was
extensive
requiring
several
puffing
trips
backandforth
next
to
it
then
he
lowered
his
backside
onto
the
unyielding
surface
with
the
same
anxiety
with
which
he
might
have
deposited
a
fortune
in
a
dubious
bank
his
hands
darted
in
and
out
of
pockets
which
apparently
held
a
small
pharmacopoeia
pulling
out
a
roll
of
absorbentcotton
from
which
he
plucked
two
wads
he
stuck
them
thoughtfully
in
his
ears
he
withdrew
a
nasalsyringe
and
used
it
vigorously
swallowed
gulps
of
a
clearly
labeled
seasickremedy
and
then
sucked
at
pills
from
various
boxes
whose
purpose
was
not
so
obvious
to
conclude
he
unstopped
a
glass
vial
and
sniffed
at
it
all
the
while
gootes
hovered
over
him
solicitously
deluging
him
with
friendly
queries
in
one
accent
or
another
i
lost
interest
in
both
fellowpassengers
for
the
plane
after
shaking
us
violently
started
forward
and
before
i
was
clearly
aware
of
it
had
left
the
ground
looking
from
the
windows
i
regretted
my
first
airplane
ride
hadnt
been
taken
under
less
trying
circumstances
for
it
was
an
extraordinarily
pleasant
experience
to
see
the
field
dwindle
into
a
miniature
of
itself
and
the
ground
beneath
become
nothing
more
than
a
large
and
highly
colored
reliefmap
to
our
right
was
the
stagnant
river
dammed
up
behind
the
blockading
arm
of
grass
leftward
downtown
the
thumb
of
the
cityhall
pointed
rudely
upward
and
far
beyond
was
the
listless
pacific
ahead
the
gridiron
of
streets
was
shockingly
interrupted
and
severed
by
the
great
green
mass
plumped
in
its
center
it
grew
to
enormous
bigness
and
everything
else
disappeared
we
were
over
and
looked
down
upon
it
a
pasture
hummock
magnified
beyond
belief
retaining
its
essential
identity
but
made
ominous
by
its
unappropriate
situation
and
size
as
we
hovered
above
the
very
pinnacle
the
rounded
peak
which
poked
up
at
us
the
pilot
spoke
over
the
intercommunication
system
we
will
circle
till
the
load
is
disposed
of
first
the
animals
will
be
dropped
then
the
equipment
finally
the
passengers
is
that
clear
everything
was
clear
to
me
except
how
we
should
escape
from
that
green
mountain
once
we
had
got
upon
it
this
was
apparently
in
the
hands
of
le
ffaçasé
a
realization
remembering
his
grisly
conversation
making
me
no
easier
in
my
mind
nor
did
i
relish
the
pilot
casual
description
of
myself
as
part
of
a
load
to
be
disposed
of
slafe
suddenly
came
to
life
and
after
peering
through
a
sort
of
lorgnette
hanging
round
his
neck
mumbling
unintelligibly
to
himself
all
the
while
started
his
camera
which
went
on
clicking
magically
with
no
apparent
help
from
him
efficiently
and
swiftly
the
crew
fastened
upon
the
helpless
and
bleating
sheep
their
parachutes
and
onebyone
dropped
them
through
the
open
bombbay
the
goat
went
last
and
she
did
not
bleat
but
dextrously
butted
two
of
her
persecutors
and
micturated
upon
the
third
before
being
cast
into
space
i
would
have
forgone
the
dubious
honor
of
being
the
first
to
land
upon
the
grass
but
the
crew
apparently
had
their
orders
i
was
courteously
tapped
upon
the
shoulder
i
presume
the
warders
are
polite
when
they
enter
the
condemned
cell
at
dawn
my
chute
was
strapped
upon
me
and
the
instructions
i
had
already
read
in
their
printed
form
at
least
sixty
times
were
repeated
verbally
so
much
to
my
confusion
that
when
i
was
finally
in
the
air
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
whether
i
counted
six
sixty
six
hundred
or
six
thousand
before
jerking
the
ripcord
whatever
the
number
it
was
evidently
not
too
far
wrong
for
although
i
received
a
marrowexploding
shock
the
parachute
opened
and
i
floated
down
but
no
sooner
were
my
fears
of
the
parachute
performance
relieved
than
i
was
for
the
first
time
assailed
with
apprehension
at
the
thought
of
my
destination
the
grass
the
weed
the
destroying
body
which
had
devoured
so
much
was
immediately
below
me
i
was
irrevocably
committed
to
come
upon
it
not
at
its
edges
where
other
men
battled
with
it
heroically
but
at
its
very
heart
where
there
were
none
to
challenge
it
still
tormented
and
dejected
i
landed
easily
and
safely
a
few
feet
from
the
goat
and
just
behind
the
rearquarters
of
one
of
the
sheep
and
now
i
pause
in
my
writing
to
sit
quite
still
and
remember
more
than
remember
live
through
again
the
sensation
of
that
first
physical
contact
with
the
heart
of
the
grass
ecstasy
is
a
pale
word
to
apply
to
the
joy
of
touching
and
resting
upon
that
verdure
soft
yes
it
was
soft
but
the
way
sand
is
soft
unyieldingly
unlike
sand
however
it
did
not
suggest
a
tightlypacked
foundation
but
rather
the
firmness
of
a
good
mattress
resting
on
a
wellmade
spring
it
was
resilient
like
carefully
tended
turf
yet
at
the
same
time
one
thought
not
of
the
solid
ground
beneath
but
of
feathers
or
even
more
of
buoyant
clouds
my
parachute
having
landed
me
gently
on
my
feet
i
sank
naturally
to
my
knees
and
then
impelled
by
some
other
force
than
gravity
my
body
fell
fully
forward
in
complete
relaxation
until
my
face
was
buried
in
the
thickly
growing
culms
and
my
arms
stretched
out
to
embrace
as
much
of
the
lush
surface
as
they
could
encompass
far
more
complex
than
the
mere
physical
reactions
were
the
psychical
ones
when
a
boy
i
had
like
every
other
daydreamed
of
discovering
new
continents
of
being
first
to
climb
a
hitherto
unscaled
peak
to
walk
before
others
the
shores
of
strange
archipelagoes
to
bring
back
tales
of
outlandish
places
and
unfrequented
isles
well
i
was
doing
these
things
now
long
after
the
disillusionment
adolescence
brought
to
these
childish
dreams
but
in
addition
it
was
in
a
sense
island
mountain
land
for
i
had
caused
it
to
be
a
sensation
of
tremendous
vivacity
and
wellbeing
seized
upon
me
i
could
not
have
lain
upon
the
grass
more
than
half
a
second
before
i
leaped
to
my
feet
with
a
nimbleness
quite
foreign
to
my
natural
habits
i
detached
the
encumbering
chute
and
jumped
and
danced
upon
the
sward
the
goat
regarded
me
speculatively
through
rectangular
pupils
but
did
not
offer
in
true
capricious
fashion
to
gambol
with
me
her
criticism
did
not
stay
me
for
i
felt
absolutely
free
extraordinarily
exhilarated
inordinately
stimulated
i
believe
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
shout
out
loud
and
break
into
song
the
descent
of
slafe
still
solemnly
recording
the
event
camera
before
him
in
the
position
of
present
arms
did
not
sober
my
intoxication
though
circumspection
caused
me
to
act
in
a
more
conventional
way
i
freed
him
from
his
harness
for
he
was
too
busy
taking
views
of
the
grass
the
sky
the
animals
and
me
to
perform
this
service
for
himself
i
do
not
know
if
he
was
affected
the
way
i
was
for
his
deceptively
genial
face
showed
no
emotion
as
he
went
on
aiming
his
camera
here
and
there
with
sour
thoroughness
then
apparently
satisfied
for
the
moment
he
applied
himself
once
more
to
the
nasalsyringe
and
the
pillboxes
on
gootes
however
the
consequence
of
the
landing
must
have
been
much
the
same
as
on
me
he
too
capered
and
sang
and
his
dialect
renderings
reached
a
new
low
such
as
even
a
burlesqueshow
comedian
would
have
spurned
tis
the
old
sod
itself
he
kept
repeating
erin
go
bragh
up
dev
and
he
laughed
inanely
we
must
have
wasted
fully
an
hour
in
this
fashion
before
enough
coolness
returned
to
allow
anything
like
calm
observation
when
it
did
we
unpacked
the
equipment
despite
obstacles
interposed
by
gootes
who
still
hilarious
found
great
delight
in
making
the
various
instruments
disappear
and
reappear
unexpectedly
it
was
quite
complete
and
we
or
rather
slafe
recorded
the
thermometer
and
barometer
readings
as
well
as
the
wind
direction
and
altitude
these
to
be
later
compared
with
others
taken
under
normal
conditions
at
the
same
hour
included
in
the
gear
were
telescope
and
binoculars
these
we
put
to
our
eyes
only
to
realize
with
surprise
that
we
were
located
in
the
center
of
a
hollow
bowl
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
feet
across
and
that
an
horizon
of
upsurging
vegetation
cut
off
our
view
of
anything
except
the
sky
itself
i
could
have
sworn
we
had
landed
on
a
flat
plateau
if
indeed
the
contour
had
not
sloped
upward
to
a
cap
how
then
did
we
come
to
find
ourselves
in
a
depression
did
the
grass
shift
like
the
sea
it
resembled
or
incredible
thought
had
our
weight
caused
us
to
sink
imperceptibly
into
a
soft
and
treacherous
bed
i
felt
my
happiness
oozing
away
what
is
man
i
thought
but
a
pigmy
trapped
in
a
bowl
bounded
by
an
unknown
beginning
and
headed
for
a
concealed
destination
it
was
sweet
to
be
but
whether
good
or
evil
lay
in
the
unseen
who
knew
uneasiness
which
did
not
quite
displace
my
earlier
buoyancy
took
hold
of
me
the
animals
in
contrast
gave
no
signals
of
disquiet
they
cropped
at
the
grass
without
nervousness
perhaps
more
from
habit
than
hunger
they
did
not
seem
to
be
obtaining
much
sustenance
clearly
they
found
it
hard
to
bite
off
mouthfuls
of
forage
rather
they
chewed
sidewise
like
a
cat
at
the
tough
rubbery
tendrils
i
tank
i
want
to
go
home
anyways
i
tank
i
want
to
get
out
of
dis
haole
remarked
gootes
slafe
had
unpacked
another
camera
and
attached
various
gadgets
to
it
pursing
his
lips
and
running
his
hands
lovingly
over
the
assembled
product
before
thrusting
it
downward
into
the
stolons
where
queer
shocks
of
radiance
seemed
to
indicate
he
was
taking
flashlight
pictures
of
the
subsurface
but
the
sheep
and
the
cameraman
could
not
distract
my
attention
from
the
appearance
of
a
trap
which
the
basin
of
grass
was
assuming
while
gootes
was
so
volatile
he
couldnt
even
put
on
a
simulated
stoicism
in
a
panic
i
started
to
climb
frantically
all
the
elation
of
my
first
encounter
with
the
mound
completely
evaporated
the
goat
raised
her
head
to
note
my
undignified
scrambling
but
the
sheep
kept
up
their
determined
nibbling
the
trough
as
i
said
could
not
have
been
more
than
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
across
and
though
the
loose
runners
impeded
my
progress
i
must
have
covered
twice
the
distance
to
the
edge
of
the
rim
before
i
realized
it
was
as
far
from
me
as
when
i
had
started
gootes
going
in
a
direction
oblique
to
mine
had
no
better
success
his
waving
arms
and
struggling
body
indicated
his
awareness
of
his
predicament
only
slafe
was
undisturbed
perhaps
unconscious
of
our
efforts
for
he
had
taken
out
still
another
camera
and
was
lying
on
his
back
pointing
it
over
our
heads
at
the
boundary
of
grass
and
sky
hysteria
burned
my
lungs
as
i
continued
the
dreamlike
battle
upward
fear
may
have
confused
me
but
it
seemed
as
though
the
enveloping
weed
was
now
positively
rather
than
merely
negatively
hampering
me
the
runners
whipped
around
my
legs
in
clinging
spirals
the
surface
always
soft
now
developed
treacherous
spots
like
quicksands
and
while
one
foot
remained
comparatively
secure
the
other
sank
deeply
tripping
me
prone
the
entangling
fronds
caught
at
my
arms
and
neck
the
green
blades
no
longer
tender
scratched
my
face
and
smothered
my
useless
cries
for
help
i
sobbed
childishly
knowing
myself
doomed
to
die
in
this
awful
morass
drowned
in
an
unnatural
sea
so
despairing
were
my
thoughts
that
i
gave
up
all
struggle
and
lay
there
weakly
crying
when
i
noticed
the
grass
relaxing
its
hold
i
was
sinking
in
no
farther
indeed
it
seemed
the
lightest
effort
would
set
me
free
i
rose
to
my
knees
and
finally
to
my
feet
but
i
was
so
shaken
by
my
battle
i
made
no
attempt
to
continue
forward
but
stood
gazing
around
me
marveling
that
i
was
still
even
if
only
for
a
few
more
moments
alive
belly
belong
you
walk
about
too
much
ay
him
fella
no
got
belly
gootes
had
given
up
his
endeavor
to
reach
the
rim
and
apparently
struggled
all
the
way
over
to
impart
if
i
understood
his
this
absurd
and
selfevident
piece
of
information
this
is
hardly
a
time
for
levity
i
rebuked
him
coldly
couldnt
think
of
a
better
reality
is
escaped
through
one
flippancy
or
another
rafe
has
his
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
still
industrious
cameraman
and
i
have
mine
i
bet
w
r
has
a
telescope
or
a
periscope
or
a
spectroscope
somehow
trained
on
us
right
now
and
will
see
to
it
the
rescue
party
arrives
ten
minutes
after
all
life
is
extinct
to
tell
the
truth
i
forgotten
our
expedition
was
but
a
stunt
initiated
by
the
to
rebound
to
its
greater
publicity
here
in
this
isolate
cup
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
of
an
anterior
existence
i
thought
of
myself
as
in
some
strange
manner
indigenous
to
and
part
of
the
weed
to
recall
now
that
we
were
here
purposefully
that
others
were
concerned
with
our
venture
and
that
we
might
reasonably
hope
for
succor
extricated
me
from
my
subjective
entanglement
with
the
grass
much
as
the
relaxation
of
my
body
a
short
while
before
freed
me
from
its
physical
bonds
i
looked
hopefully
at
the
empty
sky
of
course
we
would
get
help
at
any
moment
once
more
my
spirits
were
raised
there
was
no
point
in
trying
to
get
out
of
the
depression
now
seeing
we
could
as
easily
be
rescued
from
one
portion
of
the
grass
as
from
another
again
the
grass
was
soft
and
pleasant
to
touch
and
slafe
preoccupation
with
his
pictures
no
longer
seemed
either
eccentric
or
heroic
but
rather
proper
and
sensible
like
alice
and
the
red
queen
since
we
had
given
up
trying
to
reach
a
particular
spot
we
found
ourselves
able
to
travel
with
comparative
ease
we
inspected
slafe
activities
with
interest
and
responded
readily
to
his
autocratic
gestures
indicating
positions
and
poses
we
should
take
in
order
to
be
incorporated
in
his
record
but
our
gaiety
was
again
succeeded
by
another
period
of
despondency
we
repeated
all
our
antics
struggles
and
despair
again
i
fought
madly
against
the
enmeshing
weed
and
again
i
gave
myself
up
to
death
only
to
be
revived
in
the
moment
of
my
resignation
the
cameraman
was
still
untouched
by
the
successive
waves
of
fear
and
joyfulness
invincibly
armored
by
some
strange
spirit
he
kept
on
and
on
although
by
now
i
could
not
understand
in
those
moments
when
i
could
think
about
anything
other
than
the
grass
what
new
material
he
could
find
for
his
film
skyward
and
downward
to
all
points
of
the
compass
holding
his
cameras
at
crazy
angles
burlesquing
all
photographers
his
zeal
was
unabated
unaffected
even
by
the
force
of
the
grass
our
alternating
moods
underwent
a
subtle
change
the
spans
of
defeat
grew
longer
the
moments
of
hope
more
fleeting
the
sheep
too
at
last
were
infected
by
uneasiness
bleating
piteously
skyward
and
making
no
attempt
to
nibble
any
longer
the
goat
like
slafe
was
unmoved
she
disdained
the
emotional
sheep
and
now
with
horror
i
suddenly
realized
that
a
physical
change
had
marched
alongside
the
fluctuations
of
our
temper
the
circumference
of
the
bowl
was
the
same
as
at
first
but
imperceptibly
yet
swiftly
the
hollow
had
deepened
sunk
farther
from
the
sky
the
walls
had
become
almost
perpendicular
and
to
my
terror
i
found
myself
looking
upward
from
the
bottom
of
a
pit
at
the
retreating
sky
i
suppose
everyone
at
some
time
has
imagined
himself
irrevocably
imprisoned
cast
into
some
lightless
dungeon
and
left
to
die
such
visions
implied
human
instrumentality
human
whim
the
most
implacable
jailer
might
relent
but
this
this
was
an
incarceration
no
supplication
could
end
a
doom
not
to
be
stayed
silently
evenly
unmeasuredly
the
well
deepened
and
the
walls
became
more
sheer
like
kittens
about
to
be
ignominiously
drowned
we
slid
into
a
huddled
bunch
at
the
bottom
of
the
sack
men
and
animals
equally
helpless
and
distraught
fortunately
it
was
during
one
of
the
now
rare
periods
of
resurgence
that
we
saw
the
helicopter
for
i
do
not
think
we
should
have
had
the
spiritual
strength
needful
to
help
ourselves
had
it
come
during
our
times
of
dejection
gootes
and
i
yelled
and
waved
our
arms
frenziedly
while
slafe
exhibiting
faint
excitement
for
the
first
time
contorted
himself
to
aim
the
camera
at
the
machine
belly
evidently
the
pilot
spotted
us
without
difficulty
for
the
ship
came
to
a
hovering
rest
over
the
mouth
of
the
well
and
a
jacobsladder
unrolled
its
length
to
dangle
rope
sides
and
wooden
rungs
down
to
us
snatched
from
the
buzzsaw
as
the
express
thundered
across
the
switch
and
the
water
came
up
to
our
noses
chanted
gootes
w
r
has
a
vilely
melodramatic
sense
of
timing
the
ladder
was
nearest
slafe
but
working
more
furiously
than
ever
he
waved
it
impatiently
aside
and
so
i
grasped
it
and
started
upward
the
terror
of
the
ascent
paradoxically
was
a
welcome
one
for
it
was
the
common
fear
which
comes
to
men
on
the
battlefield
or
in
the
creaking
hours
of
the
night
the
natural
dread
of
ordinary
perils
and
not
the
unmanning
panic
inspired
by
the
awful
unknown
within
the
grass
the
helicopter
shuddered
and
dipped
causing
the
unanchored
ladder
to
sway
and
twist
until
with
each
convulsive
jerk
i
expected
to
be
thrown
off
i
bruised
and
burned
my
palms
with
the
tightness
of
my
grip
my
knees
twitched
and
my
face
and
back
and
chest
were
wet
but
in
spite
of
all
this
waves
of
thankfulness
surged
over
me
the
roaring
and
rattling
above
grew
louder
and
i
made
my
way
finally
into
the
open
glassfronted
cockpit
pulling
myself
in
with
the
last
bit
of
my
strength
for
a
long
moment
i
lay
huddled
there
exhausted
my
eye
took
in
every
trifle
every
bolthead
rivet
scratch
dent
indicator
seam
and
panel
playing
with
them
in
my
mind
making
and
rejecting
patterns
they
were
artificial
made
on
a
blessed
assemblyline
no
terrifying
product
of
nature
i
wondered
how
so
small
a
space
could
accommodate
us
all
and
was
devoutly
grateful
that
i
at
least
had
achieved
safety
reminded
of
my
companions
i
looked
out
and
down
the
grass
walls
towered
upward
almost
within
reach
beyond
the
hole
they
so
unexpectedly
made
in
its
surface
the
weed
stretched
out
levelly
peaceful
and
inviting
i
shuddered
and
peered
down
the
reversed
telescope
where
the
ladder
once
more
hung
temptingly
before
slafe
again
he
waved
it
aside
gootes
appeared
to
argue
with
him
for
he
shook
his
head
obstinately
and
went
on
using
his
camera
at
length
the
reporter
seized
him
forcibly
with
a
strength
i
had
not
known
he
possessed
and
boosted
him
up
the
first
rungs
of
the
ladder
slafe
seemed
at
last
resigned
to
leave
but
he
pointed
anxiously
to
his
other
cameras
and
cans
of
film
gootes
nodded
energetically
and
waved
the
photographer
upward
i
saw
every
detail
of
what
happened
then
emphasized
and
heightened
as
though
revealed
through
a
slowmotion
picture
i
heard
slafe
climb
on
board
and
knew
that
in
a
few
seconds
now
we
would
be
free
and
away
i
saw
the
bright
sun
reflect
itself
dazzlingly
upon
the
blades
of
the
grass
sloping
imperceptibly
away
to
merge
with
the
city
it
squatted
upon
in
the
distance
the
sun
where
we
were
was
dazzling
i
say
but
in
the
hole
where
gootes
was
now
tying
slafe
paraphernalia
to
the
ladder
the
shadow
of
the
walls
darkened
it
into
twilight
i
squinted
telepathically
urging
him
to
hurry
he
seemed
slow
and
fumbling
and
then
and
then
the
walls
collapsed
not
slowly
not
with
warning
not
dramatically
or
with
trumpets
they
came
together
as
silently
and
naturally
as
two
waves
close
a
trough
in
the
ocean
but
without
disturbance
or
upheaval
they
fell
into
an
embrace
into
a
coalescence
as
inevitable
as
the
well
they
obliterated
was
fortuitous
they
closed
like
the
jaws
of
a
trap
somehow
above
malevolence
leaving
only
the
top
of
the
ladder
projecting
upward
from
the
smooth
and
placid
surface
of
the
weed
whether
in
some
involuntary
recoil
the
pilot
pressed
a
wrong
control
or
whether
the
action
of
the
grass
itself
snatched
the
ladder
from
the
ship
i
do
know
but
that
last
bit
attached
to
the
machine
was
torn
free
and
fell
upon
the
green
it
was
the
only
thing
to
mark
the
spot
where
the
bowl
which
had
held
us
had
been
and
it
lay
a
brown
and
futile
tangle
of
rope
and
wood
a
helpless
speck
of
artifice
on
an
imperturbable
mass
of
vegetation
mr
le
ffaçasé
removed
the
tube
of
the
dictaphone
from
his
lips
as
i
entered
weener
although
a
rigid
adherence
to
fact
compels
me
to
claim
some
acquaintance
with
general
knowledge
and
a
slight
cognizance
of
abnormal
psychology
i
must
admit
bafflement
at
the
spectacle
of
your
mottled
complexion
once
more
in
these
rooms
sacred
to
the
perpetuation
of
truth
and
the
dissemination
of
enlightenment
everyday
you
embezzle
good
money
from
this
paper
under
pretense
of
giving
value
received
and
each
day
your
uselessness
becomes
more
conspicuous
almost
anyone
would
disapprove
the
divine
choice
in
the
matter
of
taking
gootes
and
leaving
you
alive
and
while
i
know
the
world
suffered
not
the
least
hurt
by
his
translation
to
whatever
baroque
noisy
and
entirely
public
hell
is
reserved
for
reporters
at
least
he
attempted
to
forge
some
ostensible
return
for
his
paycheck
mr
le
ffaçasé
i
began
indignantly
but
he
cut
me
off
you
unalloyed
imbecile
he
roared
at
least
have
the
prudence
if
not
the
intelligence
or
courtesy
to
be
silent
while
your
betters
are
speaking
gootes
was
a
bloody
knave
a
lazy
slipshod
slack
tasteless
absurd
fawning
thieving
conniving
sloven
but
even
if
he
had
the
energy
to
make
the
attempt
and
a
mind
to
put
to
it
he
could
not
in
ten
lifetimes
become
the
perfect
immaculate
and
prototypical
idiot
you
were
born
i
do
know
how
long
he
would
have
continued
in
this
insulting
vein
but
he
was
interrupted
by
the
concealed
telephone
what
in
the
name
of
the
ten
thousand
dubious
virgins
do
you
mean
by
annoying
me
he
bellowed
into
the
mouthpiece
yes
yes
i
know
all
about
deadlines
i
was
a
newspaperman
when
you
were
vainly
suckling
canine
dugs
are
you
ambitious
to
replace
me
go
get
with
child
a
mandrakeroot
you
you
journalist
i
will
meet
the
deadline
as
i
did
before
your
father
got
the
first
tepidly
lustful
idea
in
his
nulliparous
head
and
as
i
shall
after
you
have
followed
your
useless
testes
to
a
worthy
desuetude
he
replaced
the
receiver
and
picked
up
the
mouthpiece
of
the
dictaphone
again
paying
no
further
attention
to
me
he
enunciated
clearly
and
precisely
speaking
in
an
even
monotone
pausing
not
at
all
as
if
reading
from
some
prepared
script
though
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
a
vacant
spot
where
wall
and
ceiling
joined
in
the
death
today
of
jacson
gootes
the
lost
a
son
it
is
an
old
and
good
custom
on
these
solemn
occasions
to
pause
and
remember
the
dead
jacson
gootes
was
a
reporter
of
exceptional
probity
of
clear
understanding
of
indefatigable
effort
and
of
great
native
ability
his
serious
and
straightforward
approach
to
an
occupation
which
to
him
was
a
labor
of
love
was
balanced
by
a
sunny
yet
thoughtful
humor
a
combination
making
his
company
something
to
be
sought
beloved
of
his
fellow
workers
no
one
mourns
his
loss
more
sincerely
than
the
editor
through
whose
hands
passed
all
those
brilliant
contributions
now
finally
marked
as
all
newspaper
copy
is
but
though
the
has
suffered
a
personal
and
deeply
felt
bereavement
american
journalism
has
given
another
warrior
on
the
battlefield
not
by
compulsion
nor
arbitrary
selection
but
of
his
own
free
will
he
who
serves
the
public
through
the
press
is
a
soldier
and
as
a
soldier
he
is
ready
at
the
proper
time
to
go
forward
and
give
up
his
life
if
need
be
no
member
of
a
sturdy
army
was
more
worthy
of
a
gallant
end
than
jacson
gootes
he
died
not
in
some
burst
of
audacity
such
as
may
occasionally
actuate
men
to
astonishing
feats
but
doggedly
and
calmly
in
the
line
of
duty
more
than
a
mere
hero
he
was
a
good
newspaperman
there
were
tears
under
my
eyelids
as
the
editor
concluded
his
eulogy
under
that
gruff
and
even
overbearing
exterior
must
beat
a
warm
and
tender
heart
you
ca
go
by
appearances
i
always
say
and
i
felt
i
would
never
again
be
hurt
by
whatever
hasty
words
he
chose
to
hurl
at
me
wake
up
you
moonstruck
simpleton
and
stop
beaming
at
some
private
vision
the
time
has
passed
for
you
to
live
on
the
bounty
of
the
like
the
bloody
mendicant
you
are
you
have
outlived
your
usefulness
as
the
man
who
started
all
this
fuss
it
is
no
longer
good
publicity
the
matter
has
become
too
serious
no
weener
from
now
on
beneath
your
unearned
byline
the
public
will
know
you
only
as
the
first
to
set
foot
upon
this
terra
incognita
this
verdant
isle
which
flourishes
senselessly
where
only
yesterday
hollywood
nourished
senselessly
so
rest
no
more
upon
your
accidental
laurels
but
transform
yourself
into
what
nature
never
intended
a
useful
member
of
the
community
i
will
make
a
newspaperman
of
you
weener
if
i
have
to
beat
into
your
head
an
entire
typefont
from
fourpoint
up
to
and
including
those
rare
boldfaced
letters
we
keep
in
the
cellar
to
announce
on
our
final
page
one
the
end
of
the
world
you
will
cover
the
grass
as
before
and
you
will
bring
or
send
or
cause
in
some
other
manner
to
be
transmitted
to
me
copy
without
a
single
adjective
or
adverb
containing
nothing
more
lethal
than
verbs
nouns
prepositions
and
conjunctions
stating
facts
and
only
facts
clearly
and
distinctly
in
the
least
possible
number
of
words
compatible
with
the
usages
of
english
grammar
you
will
do
this
daily
and
conscientiously
weener
on
pain
of
instant
dismemberment
to
say
nothing
of
crucifixion
and
the
death
of
a
thousand
cuts
the
and
the
have
found
little
pieces
of
mine
written
without
special
instructions
suitable
for
their
columns
i
mentioned
defensively
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
me
with
such
concentrated
fury
i
thought
he
would
burst
the
diamond
stud
loose
from
his
shirtband
the
he
informed
me
was
founded
by
a
parsimonious
whoremaster
whose
sanctimonious
rantings
in
public
were
equaled
only
by
his
private
impieties
it
was
brought
to
greatness
if
inflated
circulation
be
a
synonym
by
a
veritable
journalistic
pimp
who
pandered
to
the
public
taste
for
literary
virgins
by
bribing
them
to
commit
their
perverse
acts
in
full
view
it
is
now
carried
on
by
a
spectral
corporation
losing
circulation
at
the
same
rate
a
haemophilic
loses
blood
as
for
the
it
is
enough
to
say
that
careful
research
proves
its
most
absorbing
reading
to
be
the

your
truss

is
it
not
natural
weener
that
two
such
journals
of
taste
and
enlightenment
should
appreciate
your
efforts
unfortunately
the
demands
accounts
written
in
intelligible
english
above
the
level
of
fourthgrade
grammarschool
i
would
have
been
shocked
beyond
measure
at
his
libelous
smirching
of
honored
names
and
hurt
as
well
by
his
slighting
reference
to
myself
had
i
not
known
from
the
revealing
editorial
he
had
dictated
what
a
sympathetic
and
kindly
nature
was
really
his
and
how
he
might
beneath
this
cynical
pose
have
an
admiration
great
as
mine
for
the
characters
he
had
just
slandered
you
will
be
the
new
peter
schlemihl
weener
from
now
on
you
will
go
forth
without
a
ghost
and
any
revision
essential
to
your
puny
assault
upon
the
republic
of
letters
will
be
done
by
me
and
god
help
you
if
i
find
much
to
do
for
my
life
is
passing
and
i
must
have
time
to
read
the
immortal
hobbes
before
i
die
in
spite
of
all
he
said
i
couldnt
help
but
believe
mr
le
ffaçasé
realized
my
true
worth
or
why
did
he
confer
on
me
what
was
practically
a
promotion
i
was
therefore
emboldened
to
suggest
the
cancellation
of
the
unjust
paycut
but
this
innocent
remark
called
forth
such
a
vituperative
stream
of
epithet
i
really
thought
the
apoplexy
gootes
had
predicted
was
about
to
strike
and
i
hurried
from
his
presence
lest
i
be
blamed
for
bringing
it
on
a
little
reading
brought
me
uptodate
on
the
state
of
the
grass
as
a
necessary
background
for
my
new

was
now
shaped

out
to

menacing
grass
where
he
met
his
death
under

had
another
note
about
the
weed
harassed
angelinos
distracted
terrified
by
encroaching
time
now
smothering
their
city
see
national
affairs
were
further
distracted
when
turning
on
their
radios
those
still
working
last
week
the
nasal
portentous
boom
of
the
evangelist
calling
himself
brother
paul
real
name

knight
mood
announced
the
advent
it
was
taking
place
in
the
heart
of
the
choking
grass
what
brought
death
and
disaster
to
the
country
city
offered
hope
and
bliss
to
followers
of
brother

all
you
have
advised
the
radiopreacher
to
your
savior
who
is
gathering
his
true
disciples
at
this
moment
in
the
very
center
of
the

do
not

for
he
will
sustain
and
comfort
you
in
the
thicket
through
which
the
unsaved
can
not

at

countless
followers
had
been
forcibly
restrained
from

unnumbered

gone
joyfully
to
their
beatification
not

as
joining

under

admitted
to
the
relief
rolls
of
san
diego
county
this
week
were
adam
dinkman
wife
whose
front
lawn
time
was
the
starting
point
of
the
plaguing
grass
said
dinkman
government
ought
to
pay
said
adam
dinkman
it
a
terrible
thing
i
resolved
to
send
the
dinkmans
some
money
as
soon
as
i
could
possibly
afford
it
i
made
a
note
to
this
effect
in
a
pocket
memorandumbook
feeling
the
glow
of
worthy
sacrifice
and
then
went
out
and
got
in
my
car
it
was
all
right
to
digest
facts
and
figures
about
the
weed
from
the
printed
page
but
it
was
necessary
to
see
again
its
physical
presence
before
writing
anything
for
so
critical
an
editor
as
w
r
le
ffaçasé
i
drove
through
the
second
street
tunnel
and
out
beverly
boulevard
there
several
miles
from
the
most
advanced
runners
of
the
grass
the
certainty
of
its
coming
lay
like
a
smothering
blanket
upon
the
unnaturally
silent
district
there
was
no
traffic
on
my
side
of
the
street
and
only
a
few
lastminute
straggling
jalopies
loaded
down
with
shameless
bedding
and
bundles
coughed
their
way
frantically
eastward
those
few
shops
still
unaccountably
open
were
bare
of
goods
and
the
idle
proprietors
walked
periodically
to
the
front
to
scan
the
western
sky
to
assure
themselves
the
grass
was
not
yet
in
sight
but
most
of
the
stores
were
closed
their
windows
broken
their
signs
already
tarnished
and
decrepit
with
the
age
which
seems
to
come
so
swiftly
upon
a
defunct
business
the
sidewalks
were
littered
with
rubbish
diagonally
flattened
papers
broken
boxes
odd
shoes
garbagecans
instead
of
standing
decorously
in
alleys
or
shamefacedly
along
the
curb
sprawled
in
lascivious
abandon
over
the
pavements
their
contents
strewn
widely
dogs
and
cats
deserted
by
fond
owners
snarled
and
fought
over
choicer
tidbits
i
had
not
realized
how
many
people
in
the
city
kept
pets
until
the
time
came
to
leave
them
behind
at
vermont
avenue
i
came
upon
what
i
was
sure
was
a
new
nucleus
a
lawn
green
and
tall
set
between
others
withered
and
yellow
but
i
did
not
even
bother
reporting
this
to
the
police
for
i
knew
that
before
long
the
main
body
would
take
it
to
its
bosom
and
now
looking
westward
i
could
see
the
grass
itself
a
half
mile
away
at
normandie
it
rose
high
in
the
air
dwarfing
the
buildings
in
its
path
blotting
out
the
mountains
behind
and
giving
the
illusion
of
rushing
straight
at
me
i
turned
the
car
north
not
with
the
idea
of
further
observation
but
because
standing
still
in
the
face
of
that
towering
palisade
seemed
somehow
to
invite
immediate
destruction
i
drove
slowly
and
thoughtfully
and
then
at
melrose
the
grass
came
in
sight
again
creeping
down
from
los
feliz
i
turned
back
toward
the
civic
center
it
would
not
be
more
than
a
couple
of
days
at
most
now
before
even
downtown
was
gone
during
my
drive
several
walkers
loaded
with
awkward
bundles
raised
imploring
thumbs
for
a
ride
but
knowing
to
what
lengths
desperation
will
drive
people
and
not
wishing
to
be
robbed
of
my
car
i
had
pressed
my
foot
down
and
driven
on
but
now
as
i
went
along
temple
near
rampart
a
beautiful
woman
incongruously
for
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
hot
october
dressed
in
a
fur
coat
and
with
each
gloved
hand
grasping
the
handle
of
a
suitcase
stepped
in
front
of
me
and
i
had
to
jam
on
the
brakes
to
avoid
running
over
her
the
car
stopped
radiator
almost
touching
her
but
she
made
no
attempt
to
move
a
small
hat
with
a
tiny
fringe
of
veil
concealed
her
eyes
but
her
sullen
mouth
looked
furiously
at
me
as
rigidly
clutching
her
luggage
she
barred
my
path
fearing
some
trap
i
turned
off
the
ignition
and
unobtrusively
slid
the
keys
into
a
sidepocket
before
getting
out
and
going
to
her
excuse
me
miss
can
i
help
you
she
threw
her
head
back
and
her
eyes
brown
and
glistening
appraised
me
through
heavily
painted
lashes
i
stood
there
stiffly
uncomfortable
under
her
gaze
till
i
suddenly
remembered
my
hat
and
lifted
it
with
an
awkward
bow
this
seemed
to
satisfy
her
for
still
without
speaking
she
nodded
and
thrust
the
two
suitcases
at
me
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
i
took
them
from
her
and
she
promptly
after
smoothing
her
gloves
walked
toward
the
passenger
side
of
the
car
you
want
me
to
take
you
somewhere
miss
i
inquired
quite
superfluously
she
bent
her
head
the
merest
fraction
and
then
rested
her
fingers
on
the
doorhandle
waiting
for
me
to
open
it
for
her
i
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
with
the
bags
they
were
beautifully
matched
expensive
luggage
to
put
them
in
the
turtle
and
then
had
to
make
myself
still
more
ridiculous
by
running
back
for
the
forgotten
key
resting
in
the
sidepocket
when
i
had
finally
stowed
away
the
baggage
and
opened
the
door
for
her
she
got
in
with
the
barest
of
condescending
nods
for
my
efforts
and
sat
staring
ahead
i
drove
very
slowly
nipping
off
little
glances
of
her
profile
as
we
moved
along
her
cheeks
were
smooth
as
a
chinadoll
her
nose
the
chiseled
replica
of
some
lovely
antique
marble
her
mouth
a
living
study
of
rounded
lines
never
had
i
been
so
close
to
such
an
alluring
woman
we
reached
the
civic
center
and
i
automatically
headed
for
the
building
but
i
could
not
bear
to
part
company
so
quickly
and
so
i
turned
left
instead
out
macy
street
now
we
found
ourselves
caught
in
the
traffic
snailing
eastward
in
low
gear
i
drove
a
block
then
stopped
and
waited
till
a
clear
ten
feet
ahead
permitted
another
painfully
slow
forward
motion
still
my
passenger
had
no
word
to
say
but
kept
staring
ahead
though
she
could
see
nothing
before
her
except
the
trunkladen
rearend
of
a
tottery
ford
long
past
its
majority
you
i
stumbled
i
that
is
i
mean
wasnt
there
somewhere
in
particular
you
wanted
to
go
she
nodded
still
without
looking
at
me
and
for
the
first
time
spoke
her
voice
was
deep
and
had
the
timbre
of
some
old
bronze
bell
yuma
she
said
yuma
arizona
i
asked
stupidly
again
she
nodded
faintly
in
a
panic
i
reckoned
the
contents
of
my
wallet
about
forty
dollars
i
thought
no
thirty
would
that
take
us
to
yuma
barely
perhaps
and
i
should
have
to
wire
the
for
money
to
return
besides
in
the
present
condition
of
the
roads
the
journey
would
be
a
matter
of
days
and
i
knew
she
would
accept
nothing
but
the
very
best
how
could
i
do
it
should
i
return
to
the
office
and
try
to
get
an
advance
on
next
week
salary
i
had
heard
from
more
than
one
disgruntled
reporter
that
it
was
an
impossibility
good
heavens
i
thought
i
shall
lose
her
whatever
happened
i
must
take
her
as
far
as
i
could
i
must
not
let
her
go
before
i
was
absolutely
forced
to
this
resolution
made
my
first
thought
was
to
cut
the
time
for
poking
along
in
this
packed
mass
i
was
burning
gasoline
without
getting
anywhere
taking
advantage
of
my
knowledge
of
the
sideroads
i
turned
off
at
the
first
chance
and
was
able
to
resume
a
normal
speed
as
i
avoided
towns
and
main
highways
still
she
continued
silent
until
at
length
passing
orangegroves
heavy
with
coppery
fruit
i
ventured
to
speak
myself
my
name
is
albert
weener
bert
the
right
rear
tire
kicked
up
some
dust
as
i
nervously
edged
off
the
road
somewhere
overhead
a
plane
ripped
through
the
hot
silk
of
the
sky
uh
what
uh
wo
you
tell
me
yours
still
facing
ahead
she
replied
it
isnt
necessary
after
a
few
more
miles
i
ventured
again
you
live
were
living
in
los
angeles
she
shook
her
head
impatiently
well
i
thought
really
then
poor
thing
she
probably
terribly
upset
home
and
family
lost
perhaps
money
gone
destitute
going
east
swallowing
pride
make
a
new
start
with
the
help
of
unsympathetic
relatives
she
has
only
me
to
depend
on
i
must
not
fail
her
break
the
ice
whatever
attitude
her
natural
pride
dictates
offer
your
services
i
on
the
i
said
i
the
man
who
first
walked
on
top
of
the
grass
ten
miles
later
i
inquired
wouldnt
you
be
more
comfortable
with
that
heavy
fur
coat
off
i
can
put
it
in
the
back
with
your
luggage
and
it
wo
be
crushed
she
shook
her
head
more
impatiently
suddenly
i
remembered
the
car
radio
installed
a
few
days
before
a
little
cheerful
music
calms
the
soul
i
turned
it
on
and
got
a
band
playing
a
brandnew
hit
green
as
grass
oh
no
no
noise
of
course
how
thoughtless
of
me
the
very
word
grass
reminded
her
of
her
tragic
situation
i
kicked
myself
for
my
tactlessness
we
skirted
riverside
and
joined
the
highway
again
at
beaumont
where
we
were
unavoidably
packed
into
the
slowmoving
mass
i
sorry
i
apologized
but
i
can
take
a
chance
again
at
banning
and
drive
up
into
the
mountains
to
get
away
from
this
an
hour
later
i
suggested
stopping
for
something
to
eat
she
shook
her
head
but
it
getting
late
i
said
pretty
soon
we
shall
have
to
think
about
stopping
for
the
night
she
raised
her
left
hand
imperatively
drive
all
night
this
would
certainly
solve
part
of
my
financial
problem
but
i
was
hungry
and
unreasonably
more
irritated
by
her
refusal
of
food
than
her
unsociability
i
have
to
eat
even
if
you
do
i
told
her
rudely
i
going
to
stop
at
the
next
place
i
see
with
the
same
left
hand
she
made
a
gesture
of
resignation
i
pulled
up
before
the
roadside
cafe
wo
you
change
your
mind
and
come
in
at
least
for
a
cup
of
coffee
no
i
went
in
angrily
and
ate
who
was
she
to
treat
me
like
a
hired
chauffeur
a
mere
pickup
i
raged
a
stray
woman
found
on
a
street
by
god
she
would
have
the
courtesy
at
least
to
address
me
her
benefactor
civilly
or
else
i
abandon
her
here
on
the
highway
and
return
to
los
angeles
i
finished
my
meal
full
of
determination
and
strode
back
purposefully
toward
the
car
she
was
still
sitting
rigid
staring
through
the
windshield
i
got
in
you
know
i
began
she
did
not
hear
me
i
turned
on
the
ignition
pressed
the
starterbutton
and
drove
ahead
soddeneyed
with
lack
of
sleep
and
outraged
at
her
taciturnity
i
breakfasted
alone
on
the
soggiest
wheatcakes
and
the
muddiest
coffee
i
have
ever
demeaned
my
stomach
with
the
absence
of
my
customary
morning
paper
added
the
final
touch
to
my
wretchedness
but
one
would
have
thought
to
look
at
my
companion
that
she
had
been
refreshed
by
a
lengthy
repose
had
bathed
at
leisure
and
eaten
the
most
delicate
of
continental
breakfasts
there
was
not
a
smudge
on
her
suede
gloves
nor
a
speck
upon
her
small
hat
and
the
mascara
on
her
eyelashes
might
have
been
renewed
but
a
moment
before
the
road
curved
through
vast
hummocks
of
sand
which
for
no
good
reason
reminded
me
of
the
grass
in
its
early
stages
reminded
i
wanted
to
know
what
the
latest
news
was
how
far
the
weed
had
progressed
in
the
night
thoughtlessly
without
remembering
her
interdiction
i
turned
the
knob
kfkfkk
squeaked
the
radio
please
she
said
in
anything
but
a
pleading
tone
and
turned
it
off
well
i
thought
this
is
certainly
going
too
far
i
opened
my
mouth
to
voice
the
angry
words
but
a
look
at
her
stopped
me
i
couldnt
help
but
feel
her
imperviousness
was
fragile
that
harsh
speech
might
shatter
a
calm
too
taut
to
be
anything
but
hysterical
i
drove
on
without
speaking
until
the
hummocks
gave
way
again
to
smooth
desert
we
soon
be
in
yuma
i
announced
arent
you
going
to
tell
me
your
name
it
isnt
important
she
repeated
but
it
important
to
me
i
told
her
boldly
i
want
to
know
who
the
beautiful
lady
was
whom
i
drove
from
los
angeles
to
yuma
she
shook
her
head
irritably
and
we
crossed
the
bridge
into
arizona
all
right
this
is
yuma
now
where
here
right
here
in
the
middle
of
the
road
she
nodded
i
looked
helplessly
at
her
but
her
gaze
was
still
fixed
ahead
resignedly
i
got
out
took
her
bags
from
the
turtle
and
set
them
beside
the
road
opened
the
door
she
descended
smoothed
her
gloves
straightened
the
edge
of
her
veil
brushed
an
immaterial
speck
from
her
coat
and
after
the
briefest
of
acknowledging
nods
picked
up
her
grips
but
ca
i
carry
them
for
you
she
did
not
even
answer
this
with
her
usual
headshake
but
began
walking
resolutely
back
over
the
way
we
had
come
bewildered
i
watched
her
a
moment
and
then
got
into
the
car
and
turned
it
around
trying
to
keep
her
in
sight
in
the
rearview
mirror
as
i
did
so
it
was
an
awkward
procedure
on
a
highway
heavy
with
traffic
by
the
time
i
had
reversed
my
direction
she
was
gone
due
either
to
le
ffaçasé
perverse
sense
of
humor
or
what
is
more
likely
his
excessive
meanness
with
money
my
collect
telegram
asking
for
funds
to
return
from
yuma
received
the
following
ridiculous
reply
know
no
sanguinary
weener
intelligencer
no
eleemosynary
institution
eat
cake
the
meaning
of
the
last
two
words
escaped
me
and
it
was
possible
they
were
added
purely
to
make
the
requisite
ten
at
all
events
le
ffaçasé
parsimony
made
a
very
inconvenient
and
unpleasant
trip
back
for
me
milestoned
by
my
few
valuable
possessions
pawned
with
suspicious
and
grasping
servicestation
owners
when
i
left
a
map
of
the
downtown
district
would
have
resembled
the
profile
of
a
bowl
now
it
was
a
bottle
with
only
a
narrow
neck
still
clear
the
weed
had
flung
itself
upon
pasadena
and
was
curving
back
along
huntington
drive
while
to
the
south
the
opposing
pincer
was
feeling
its
way
along
soto
street
into
boyle
heights
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
passed
through
the
police
lines
into
the
doomed
district
if
i
had
thought
deserted
beverly
boulevard
a
sad
sight
only
three
days
before
what
can
i
say
about
my
impression
of
the
city
nerve
center
in
its
last
hours
abandoned
automobiles
stood
in
the
streets
at
the
spot
where
they
had
run
out
of
gas
or
some
minor
mechanical
failure
had
halted
them
dead
streetcars
like
big
game
stopped
short
by
the
hunter
bullet
stayed
where
the
failure
of
electricpower
caught
them
the
tall
buildings
reeked
of
desertion
as
if
their
emptying
had
dulled
some
superficial
gloss
and
made
them
dim
and
colorless
but
contrast
the
dying
city
with
the
wall
of
living
green
north
west
and
south
towering
ever
higher
and
preparing
to
carry
out
the
sentence
already
passed
and
the
victim
becomes
insignificant
in
the
presence
of
the
executioner
i
was
reminded
of
the
well
where
gootes
died
for
here
except
on
one
small
side
the
grass
rose
like
the
inside
of
a
stovepipe
to
the
sky
but
i
suffered
neither
the
same
despair
nor
the
unaccountable
elation
i
had
upon
that
hill
perhaps
because
the
trough
was
so
much
bigger
or
because
the
animate
thing
was
not
beneath
my
feet
to
communicate
those
feelings
directly
there
had
evidently
been
some
looting
not
so
much
from
greed
as
from
the
natural
impulse
of
human
nature
to
steal
and
act
lawlessly
as
soon
as
police
vigilance
is
relaxed
here
and
there
stores
were
opened
nakedly
to
the
street
their
contents
spilled
about
but
such
scenes
were
surprisingly
rare
the
hopelessness
of
transporting
stolen
or
any
other
possessions
acting
as
a
greater
deterrent
than
morality
one
way
or
another
as
the
saying
has
it
crime
does
not
pay
few
people
were
visible
and
these
were
divided
sharply
into
two
categories
those
clearly
intent
upon
concluding
some
business
rushing
furiously
papers
briefcases
or
articles
of
worth
in
their
hands
and
those
obviously
without
purpose
dazed
listless
stumbling
against
the
curbstones
as
they
shambled
along
casting
furtive
glances
toward
the
green
glacier
in
the
background
the
newspaper
office
contained
only
people
of
the
first
type
le
ffaçasé
had
come
out
of
his
sanctuary
for
the
first
time
within
memory
of
anybody
on
the
staff
still
collarless
snuffbox
in
hand
he
napoleonically
directed
the
removal
of
those
valuables
without
which
the
newspaper
could
not
continue
he
was
cool
efficient
seemed
to
have
eyes
everywhere
and
know
everything
going
on
in
the
entire
building
he
spent
neither
greetings
nor
reproaches
on
me
indeed
was
not
looking
in
my
direction
but
somehow
sensed
my
presence
through
his
back
for
he
said
without
turning
round
weener
if
you
have
concluded
your
unaccountable
peregrinations
remove
the
two
files
marked
and
to
pomona
if
you
mislay
one
scrap
of
paper
they
contain
the
bartering
of
a
thousand
weeners
being
an
inadequate
equivalent
your
miserable
substance
will
be
attached
to
four
tractors
headed
in
divergent
directions
do
come
back
here
but
attempt
for
once
to
palliate
the
offense
of
your
birth
and
go
interview
that
francis
female
interview
her
not
yourself
bring
back
a
story
complete
and
terse
or
commit
the
first
sensible
act
of
your
life
with
any
weapon
you
choose
and
charge
the
instrument
to
the
i
havent
the
slightest
idea
where
miss
francis
is
to
be
found
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
issued
orders
to
four
or
five
other
people
and
continued
calmly
i
am
not
conducting
a
school
of
journalism
if
i
were
i
should
have
a
special
duncecap
imported
solely
for
your
use
the
lowest
copyboy
knows
better
than
to
utter
such
an
inanity
you
will
find
the
francis
and
interview
her
i
busy
get
the
hell
out
of
here
and
handle
those
files
carefully
if
you
value
that
cadaver
you
probably
think
of
as
the
repository
of
your
soul
i
am
not
a
drayman
and
i
resented
the
menial
duty
of
sliding
those
heavy
filecases
down
four
flights
of
stairs
but
at
a
time
like
this
i
thought
philosophically
a
man
has
duties
he
can
not
shirk
besides
le
ffaçasé
was
old
i
could
afford
to
humor
him
even
if
it
meant
demeaning
myself
with
one
of
the
cases
in
back
i
sadly
regarded
the
other
one
occupying
most
of
the
front
seat
if
she
had
at
least
given
me
her
name
i
would
have
searched
and
searched
until
i
found
her
this
train
of
thought
reminded
me
of
le
ffaçasé
command
to
find
miss
francis
and
so
i
concentrated
my
attention
on
getting
away
from
the
office
it
was
no
light
labor
the
stalled
streetcars
and
automobiles
presented
grave
hazards
to
the
unwary
the
air
smelt
of
death
and
nervously
i
pressed
the
accelerator
to
get
away
quickly
from
this
tomb
i
crossed
the
dry
riverbed
and
made
my
way
slowly
to
pomona
delivered
the
files
and
reluctantly
began
seeking
miss
francis
it
was
practically
impossible
to
discover
any
one
person
among
so
many
scattered
and
disorganized
people
but
chance
aided
my
native
intelligence
and
perseverance
only
the
day
before
she
had
been
involved
with
an
indignant
group
of
the
homeless
who
attributed
their
misfortunes
to
her
and
overcoming
their
natural
american
chivalry
toward
the
weaker
sex
had
tried
to
revenge
themselves
i
was
therefore
able
to
locate
her
not
ten
miles
from
the
temporary
headquarters
of
the
her
laboratory
was
an
abandoned
chickenhouse
which
must
have
reminded
her
constantly
of
her
lost
kitchen
she
looked
almost
jaunty
as
she
greeted
me
a
cobweb
from
the
roof
of
the
decaying
shed
caught
in
her
hair
i
have
no
profitable
secrets
to
market
weener
youre
wasting
your
time
with
me
i
am
not
here
as
a
salesman
miss
francis
i
said
the
would
like
to
tell
its
readers
how
you
are
getting
on
with
your
search
for
some
cure
for
the
grass
you
talk
as
if
were
a
disease
there
is
no
cure
for
life
but
death
since
she
was
going
to
be
so
touchy
about
the
grass
as
if
it
were
a
personal
possession
why
i
thought
it
as
much
mine
as
hers
i
substituted
a
more
diplomatic
form
of
words
well
i
have
made
an
interesting
discovery
she
conceded
grudgingly
and
pointed
to
a
row
of
flowerpots
her
eyes
lighting
as
she
scanned
the
single
blades
of
grass
perhaps
an
inch
and
a
half
high
growing
in
each
the
sight
meant
nothing
to
me
and
she
must
have
gathered
as
much
from
my
expression
she
explained
germinated
from
seeds
borne
by
the
inoculated
plant
obviously
the
omnivorous
capacity
has
not
been
transmitted
to
offspring
this
was
probably
fascinating
to
her
or
a
gardener
or
botanist
but
i
couldnt
see
how
it
concerned
me
or
the
it
could
be
a
vitamin
deficiency
she
muttered
incomprehensibly
or
evasion
of
the
laws
regarding
compulsory
education
these
plants
indicate
the
affected
grass
may
propagate
its
abnormal
condition
only
through
the
extension
of
the
already
changed
stolons
or
rhizomes
it
means
that
only
the
parent
which
is
presumably
not
immortal
is
aberrant
the
offspring
is
no
different
from
the
weed
householders
have
been
cursing
ever
since
the
mission
fathers
enslaved
the
digger
indians
why
then
i
exclaimed
suddenly
enlightened
all
we
have
to
do
is
wait
until
the
grass
dies
or
until
it
meets
some
insuperable
object
supplemented
miss
francis
my
faith
in
insuperable
objects
had
been
somewhat
shaken
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
be
before
the
grass
dies
i
asked
her
she
regarded
me
gravely
as
though
i
had
been
a
child
asking
an
absurd
question
possibly
a
thousand
years
my
enthusiasm
was
dampened
but
after
leaving
her
i
remembered
how
certain
types
of
people
always
look
for
the
dark
side
of
things
it
costs
no
more
to
be
an
optimist
than
a
pessimist
it
is
sunshine
grows
flowers
not
clouds
and
if
miss
francis
chose
to
think
the
grass
might
live
a
thousand
years
i
was
equally
free
to
think
it
might
die
next
week
thus
heartened
by
this
bit
of
homely
philosophy
just
as
valid
as
any
of
the
stuff
entombed
in
wordy
books
i
wrote
up
my
interview
careful
to
guide
myself
by
all
the
stifling
strictures
and
adjurations
impressed
upon
me
by
the
tyrannically
narrowminded
editor
if
i
may
anticipate
the
order
of
events
it
appeared
next
day
in
almost
recognizable
form
under
the
heading
abnormal
grass
to
die
soon
says
originator
the
small
city
of
pomona
was
swollen
to
boomtown
size
by
the
excursion
there
of
so
many
enterprises
forced
from
los
angeles
ordinary
citizens
without
heavy
responsibilities
when
uprooted
thought
only
of
putting
as
much
distance
as
possible
between
themselves
and
their
persecutor
but
the
officials
the
industrialists
the
businessmen
the
staffs
of
great
newspapers
hovered
close
by
like
small
boys
near
the
knothole
in
the
ballpark
fence
from
which
theyd
been
banished
by
an
officious
cop
the
was
lodged
over
the
printshop
of
a
local
tributary
which
had
agreed
to
the
ousting
with
the
most
hypocritical
assurances
of
joy
at
the
honor
done
them
and
payment
in
the
smallest
possible
type
by
the
addition
to
the
great
newspaper
masthead
of
the
words
and
pomona
packed
into
this
inadequate
space
were
the
entire
staff
and
files
of
the
metropolitan
daily
no
wonder
the
confusion
obviated
all
possibility
of
normal
routine
in
addition
the
disruption
of
railroad
schedules
made
the
delivery
of
mail
a
hazard
rather
than
a
certainty
perhaps
this
was
why
weeks
after
they
were
due
it
was
only
upon
my
return
from
interviewing
miss
francis
i
received
my
checks
from
the
and
the
it
may
have
been
the
boomtown
atmosphere
i
have
already
mentioned
or
because
at
the
same
time
i
got
my
weekly
salary
at
any
event
moved
by
an
unaccountable
impulse
i
took
the
two
checks
to
a
barbershop
where
perhaps
incongruously
a
wellknown
firm
of
los
angeles
stockbrokers
had
quartered
themselves
i
forced
the
checks
upon
a
troubledlooking
individual
too
taciturn
to
be
mistaken
for
the
barber
and
mumbling
buy
me
all
the
shares
of
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
concentrates
this
will
cover
hurried
out
before
sober
thought
could
cause
me
to
change
my
mind
for
certainly
this
was
no
investment
my
cool
judgment
would
approve
but
the
wildest
hunch
causing
me
to
embark
on
what
was
no
less
than
a
speculation
i
went
back
to
the
desk
i
shared
with
ten
others
bitterly
regretting
the
things
i
might
have
bought
with
the
money
and
berating
myself
for
my
rashness
only
the
abnormal
pressure
of
events
could
have
made
me
yield
to
so
irrational
an
impulse
in
the
meantime
things
happened
fast
barely
had
the
tardiest
employees
got
away
when
the
enveloping
jaws
of
the
weed
closed
tight
catching
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
property
within
the
project
to
bomb
the
grass
out
of
existence
dormant
for
some
weeks
could
no
longer
be
denied
even
its
most
ardent
advocates
however
now
conceded
reluctantly
that
ordinary
explosives
would
be
futile
more
than
futile
an
assistance
to
the
growth
by
scattering
the
propagating
fragments
for
the
first
time
people
began
talking
openly
of
using
the
outlawed
atomicbomb
the
instant
response
to
this
suggestion
was
an
overwhelming
opposition
the
president
congress
the
army
navy
and
public
opinion
generally
agreed
that
the
weapon
was
too
terrible
to
use
in
so
comparatively
trivial
a
cause
but
the
machinery
for
some
type
of
bombing
had
been
set
in
motion
and
had
to
be
used
the
fuel
was
stored
the
airfields
jammed
all
available
planes
new
old
obsolescent
and
obsolete
assembled
and
for
three
days
and
nights
the
great
fleets
shuttled
backandforth
over
the
jungled
area
dropping
thousands
of
tons
of
incendiary
bombs
following
close
behind
still
more
planes
dropped
cargoes
of
fuel
to
feed
the
colossal
bonfire
inverted
lightning
flashes
leapt
upward
and
after
them
great
rolling
white
yellow
red
and
blue
flames
the
smoke
the
smell
of
roasting
vegetation
the
roar
and
crackle
of
the
conflagration
and
the
heat
engendered
were
all
noticeable
as
far
away
as
capistrano
and
santa
barbara
down
from
the
sky
through
the
surface
of
the
grass
the
incendiaries
burned
great
patches
clear
to
the
earth
the
weed
which
had
resisted
fire
so
contemptuously
before
suddenly
became
inflammable
and
burned
like
celluloid
for
days
miles
of
twisted
stems
cleaned
of
blade
and
life
exposed
tortured
nakedness
to
aerial
reconnoiter
bald
spots
the
size
of
villages
appeared
black
and
smoldering
the
shape
of
the
mass
was
altered
and
altered
again
but
when
long
after
the
last
spark
flickered
out
and
the
last
ember
grew
dull
the
grass
itself
torn
and
injured
but
not
defeated
or
even
noticeably
beaten
back
remained
it
had
been
a
brilliant
performance
and
an
ineffective
one
the
failure
of
the
incendiary
bombing
not
only
produced
ruefully
triumphant
itoldyousos
from
disgruntled
and
doubly
outraged
propertyowners
but
a
new
crop
of
bids
for
the
reward
to
the
developer
of
a
saving
agent
from
suggested
emigrations
to
mars
and
giant
magnifying
glasses
set
up
to
wither
the
grass
with
the
aid
of
the
sun
they
ranged
to
projects
for
cutting
a
canal
clear
around
the
weed
from
san
francisco
bay
to
the
colorado
river
and
letting
the
pacific
ocean
do
the
rest
another
solution
envisaged
shutting
off
all
light
from
the
grass
by
means
of
innumerable
radiobeams
to
interrupt
the
sun
rays
in
the
hope
that
with
an
inability
to
manufacture
chlorophyll
an
atrophy
would
set
in
several
contestants
urged
inoculating
other
grasses
such
as
bamboo
with
the
metamorphizer
expecting
the
two
giants
of
vegetation
like
the
kilkenny
cats
would
end
by
devouring
each
other
this
proposal
received
such
wide
popular
support
there
is
reason
to
believe
it
got
some
serious
consideration
in
official
quarters
but
it
was
eventually
abandoned
on
the
ground
that
while
it
gave
only
a
single
slim
chance
of
success
it
certainly
doubled
the
potential
growths
to
contend
with
the
analogy
of
a
backfire
in
forest
conflagrations
was
deemed
poetic
but
inapplicable
more
comparatively
prosaic
courses
included
walling
in
the
grass
with
concrete
the
great
wall
of
china
was
the
only
work
of
man
visible
from
the
moon
were
americans
to
let
backward
china
best
them
a
concrete
wall
only
a
mile
high
and
half
a
mile
thick
could
be
seen
by
any
curious
astronomer
on
the
planet
venus
assuming
venerians
to
be
afflicted
with
terrestrial
vices
and
would
cost
no
more
than
a
very
small
war
to
say
nothing
of
employing
thousands
who
would
otherwise
dissipate
the
taxpayers
money
on
relief
a
variant
of
this
plan
was
to
smother
the
weed
with
tons
of
dry
cement
and
sand
from
airplanes
the
rainy
season
due
to
begin
in
a
few
months
would
add
the
necessary
water
and
the
grass
would
then
be
encased
in
a
presumably
unbreakable
tomb
but
the
most
popular
suggestion
embodied
the
use
of
salt
ordinary
table
salt
from
their
own
experience
in
backyard
and
garden
eager
men
and
women
wrote
in
urging
this
common
mineral
be
used
to
end
the
menace
of
the
grass
it
will
kill
ennything
wrote
an
imperial
valley
farmer
its
lethal
effect
on
plantlife
is
instantaneous
agreed
a
former
beverly
hills
resident
i
know
there
is
not
anything
like
salt
to
destroy
weeds
was
part
of
a
long
and
rambling
letter
on
blueruled
tabletpaper
in
the
june
of
or
i
can
not
remember
exactly
it
may
have
been
i
accidentally
dropped
some
salt
on
a
beautiful
plumbago
it
was
proposed
to
spray
the
surface
to
drive
tunnels
through
the
roots
to
conduct
brine
to
bombard
sectors
with
sixteeninch
guns
firing
shrapnel
loaded
with
salt
to
isolate
by
means
of
a
wide
saline
band
the
whole
territory
both
occupied
and
threatened
salt
enthusiasts
argued
that
nothing
except
a
few
million
tons
of
an
inexpensive
mineral
would
be
wasted
if
an
improbable
failure
occurred
but
if
successful
in
stopping
the
advance
the
country
could
wait
safely
behind
its
rampart
till
some
weapon
to
regain
the
overrun
area
was
found
but
the
salt
advocates
didnt
have
everything
their
own
way
there
arose
a
bitter
antisalt
faction
taking
pleasure
at
hurling
sneers
at
these
optimistic
predictions
and
delight
in
demolishing
the
arguments
miss
francis
they
said
who
ought
to
know
more
about
it
than
anyone
else
claimed
the
grass
would
break
down
even
the
most
stable
compound
and
take
what
it
needed
well
salt
was
a
compound
wasnt
it
if
the
prosalt
fanatics
had
their
way
they
would
just
be
offering
food
to
a
hungry
plant
the
salt
supporters
asked
what
proof
miss
francis
had
ever
advanced
that
the
plant
absorbed
everything
or
indeed
that
her
metamorphizer
had
anything
to
do
with
metabolism
and
had
not
merely
induced
some
kind
of
botanical
giantism
the
antisalts
jeering
at
their
enemies
as
salinists
and
salinites
promptly
threw
away
miss
hypothetical
support
and
relied
instead
on
the
proposition
that
if
the
salt
were
to
be
efficacious
an
unlikely
contingency
it
would

the

everyone
would

the

waited
for
nothing
it
seemed
to
take
new
strength
from
the
indignities
inflicted
upon
it
and
it
increased
if
anything
its
tempo
of
growth
it
plunged
into
the
ocean
in
a
dozen
spots
at
once
it
swarmed
over
sand
which
had
never
known
anything
but
cactus
and
the

became
great
humps
of

against
the

this
last
conquest
shocked
those
who
had
thought
the
mountains
immune
in
their
inhospitable
heights
uninoculated
had
always
shunned
coldness
though
it
survived
some
degrees
of

the
giant
growth

seemed
to
be
less
subject
to

inhibition

it

showed
slower

became
a
sterner
taskmaster
a
more
pettishly
exacting
employer

the
living
guts
of
william

he
raged
had
no
one
ever
driven
the
simple
elements
of
punctuation
into
my
bloody
head
had
no
schoolmaster
in
moments
of
heroic
enthusiasm
attempted
to
pound
a
few
rules
of
rhetoric
through
my
incrassate
skull
had
i
never
heard
of
taste
was
the
word
style
outside
my
macilent
vocabulary
what
the
devil
did
i
mean
by
standing
there
with
my
mouth
open
exposing
my
unfortunate
teeth
for
all
the
world
to
see
was
it
possible
for
any
allegedly
human
to
be
as
addlepated
as
i
and
had
i
been
thrust
from
my
mother
womb
i
suppress
his
horrible
adjectives
only
to
torment
and
afflict
his
longsuffering
editorial
patience
a
hundred
times
i
was
tempted
to
sever
my
connection
with
this
journalistic
autocrat
my
column
was
widely
read
and
two
publishinghouses
had
approached
me
with
the
idea
of
putting
out
a
book
any
editorial
revision
and
emendations
to
be
taken
care
of
by
them
without
disturbing
me
at
all
i
could
have
allied
myself
with
almost
any
paper
in
the
country
undoubtedly
at
better
than
the
meager
stipend
le
ffaçasé
doled
out
to
me
but
i
think
loyalty
is
one
of
the
most
admirable
of
virtues
and
it
was
not
in
my
nature
to
desert
the
certainly
not
till
i
could
secure
a
lengthy
and
ironclad
contract
such
as
for
some
reason
other
papers
seemed
unwilling
to
offer
me
in
accord
with
this
innate
loyalty
of
mine
i
take
no
credit
for
it
i
was
born
that
way
i
did
not
balk
at
the
assignments
given
me
though
they
ranged
from
the
hazardous
to
the
absurd
one
of
the
more
pleasant
of
these
excursions
thought
up
by
mr
le
ffaçasé
was
to
fly
over
the
grass
and
to
catalina
embark
on
a
chartered
boat
there
and
survey
the
parts
of
the
coast
now
overrun
a
fresh
point
of
observation
accompanying
me
was
the
moviecameraman
rafe
slafe
as
uncommunicative
and
earnest
in
his
medications
as
before
it
was
a
sad
sight
to
see
neat
rectangular
patterns
of
roads
and
highways
cultivated
fields
and
orangegroves
checkered
towns
and
sprawling
suburbs
come
to
an
abrupt
stop
where
they
were
blotted
out
by
the
regimented
uniformity
of
the
onrushing
grass
for
miles
we
flew
above
its
dazzling
green
until
our
eyes
ached
from
the
sameness
and
our
minds
were
dulled
from
the
lack
of
variety
below
on
the
sea
far
ahead
a
frothing
whitecap
broke
the
monotony
of
color
a
flyingfish
jumped
out
of
the
water
to
glisten
for
a
moment
in
the
sun
loose
seaweed
floated
on
the
surface
to
change
in
some
degree
the
intense
blue
but
here
below
no
alien
touch
lightened
the
unnatural
homogeneity
no
solitary
tree
broke
this
endless
pasture
now
healed
of
the
wounds
inflicted
by
the
incendiary
bombing
no
saltlick
wandering
stream
or
struggling
bush
enlivened
this
prairie
there
was
not
even
an
odd
conformation
a
higher
clump
here
or
there
a
dead
patch
to
relieve
the
unimaginative
symmetry
i
have
read
of
men
going
mad
in
solitary
confinement
from
looking
at
the
same
unchanging
walls
well
here
was
a
solitary
cell
hundreds
of
miles
in
area
and
its
power
to
destroy
the
mind
was
that
much
magnified
i
got
little
consolation
from
the
presence
of
the
others
for
the
pilot
was
engaged
in
navigation
while
slafe
was
as
ever
singlemindedly
recording
mile
after
mile
of
the
verdant
mat
beneath
never
pausing
nor
speaking
though
how
he
justified
the
use
of
so
much
film
when
one
foot
was
identical
with
what
went
before
and
the
next
i
could
not
understand
at
last
we
cleared
the
awful
cancer
and
flew
over
the
sea
a
thousand
variations
i
had
never
noticed
before
offered
themselves
to
my
suddenly
refreshed
eyes
not
for
one
split
second
was
the
water
the
same
leaping
tossing
spiraling
foaming
back
upon
itself
making
its
own
shadows
and
mirroring
in
an
infinitely
faceted
glass
the
sunlight
it
changed
so
constantly
it
was
impossible
to
grasp
even
a
fraction
of
its
mutations
but
slafe
evidently
did
not
share
my
blessed
relief
for
he
turned
his
camera
back
to
catch
every
last
glimpse
of
the
solid
green
i
was
so
happy
to
leave
behind
at
the
airport
on
the
way
to
the
boat
on
the
little
vessel
itself
i
expected
slafe
to
relax
to
indulge
in
a
conversational
word
to
do
something
to
mark
him
as
more
than
an
automaton
but
his
actions
were
confined
to
using
the
nasalsyringe
to
exchanging
one
camera
for
another
to
quizzing
the
sun
through
that
absurd
lorgnette
and
to
muttering
over
cans
of
film
which
he
sorted
and
resorted
always
to
his
inevitable
discontent
while
we
waited
to
start
a
perverse
fog
rolled
between
us
and
the
mainland
it
made
a
dramatic
curtain
over
the
object
of
our
visit
and
emphasized
the
normality
and
untouchedness
of
avalon
behind
us
as
the
boat
got
under
way
strain
my
eyes
as
i
could
eastward
not
the
faintest
suggestion
of
the
ominous
outline
showed
we
sped
toward
it
cutting
the
purple
sea
into
white
foam
slafe
was
in
the
bow
customarily
taciturn
the
crew
were
busy
alone
on
board
i
had
no
immediate
occupation
and
so
i
took
out
my
copy
of
the
and
after
reading
the
column
which
went
under
my
name
and
noting
the
incredible
bad
taste
which
had
diluted
when
it
had
not
excluded
everything
i
had
written
i
turned
as
for
consolation
to
the
marketquotations
the
average
was
down
again
as
might
be
expected
since
the
spread
of
the
weed
had
unsettled
the
delicate
balance
of
the
stockmarket
my
eyes
automatically
ran
down
the
column
and
over
to
the
corner
where
stocks
were
quoted
in
cents
to
reassure
my
faith
in
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
concentrates
there
it
was
immovable
through
any
storm
or
stress
or
injudicious
investment
by
albert
weener
cp
ac
i
must
have
raised
my
eyes
from
the
newspaper
just
about
the
time
the
fog
lifted
before
us
like
the
smokewreath
accompanying
the
discharge
of
some
giant
cannon
the
green
mass
volleyed
into
the
sea
it
did
not
slope
gently
like
a
beach
or
offer
a
rugged
shoulder
to
be
gnawed
away
as
a
rocky
cliff
but
thundered
forward
into
the
surging
brine
yielding
but
invincible
a
landforce
potent
as
the
wave
itself
hundreds
of
feet
into
the
air
it
towered
falling
abruptly
in
a
sharp
wall
its
ends
and
fringes
merging
with
the
surf
and
wallowing
in
happy
freedom
the
breakers
did
not
batter
it
for
it
offered
them
no
enmity
to
rage
and
boil
upon
but
giving
way
with
each
surge
smothered
the
eternal
anger
of
the
ocean
with
its
own
placid
surety
the
seagulls
the
helldivers
pelicans
seapigeons
had
not
been
affected
resting
briefly
on
the
weed
they
winged
out
for
their
food
and
returned
it
mattered
no
more
to
them
that
the
manmade
piers
and
wharves
the
seacoast
towns
gypjoints
rollercoasters
whorehouses
cottages
hotels
streets
gastanks
quarries
potterykilns
oilfields
and
factories
had
been
swallowed
up
than
if
some
old
wreck
in
the
sand
once
offering
them
foothold
had
been
taken
back
by
the
sea
if
i
thought
the
grass
awesome
from
the
land
monotonous
from
the
air
it
seemed
eternal
from
the
water
but
impressive
as
it
was
from
any
angle
there
were
just
so
many
things
i
could
say
about
it
my
art
unlike
slafe
not
permitting
of
endless
repetition
i
was
glad
to
get
back
to
the
pomona
office
to
pad
what
little
copy
i
had
retire
into
the
small
tent
i
shared
with
six
other
sufferers
from
the
housing
shortage
and
attempt
some
sleep
the
course
mapped
for
the
saltband
caused
almost
as
much
controversy
anguish
and
denunciation
as
the
proposal
itself
cities
and
towns
fought
to
have
the
saltband
laid
between
them
and
the
approaching
grass
understandably
ignoring
larger
calculations
and
considerations
cattle
ranchers
shot
at
surveying
parties
and
individual
farmers
or
homeowners
fought
against
having
their
particular
piece
of
property
covered
with
salt
the
original
plan
had
contemplated
straight
lines
eventually
the
band
twisted
and
turned
like
a
typewriter
ribbon
plagued
by
a
kitten
avoiding
not
only
natural
obstacles
but
the
domains
of
those
with
proper
influence
recovery
plants
worked
three
shifts
a
day
to
pile
up
great
mounds
of
the
white
crystals
which
were
hauled
to
the
airfields
by
trains
and
trucks
the
laden
trucks
moved
over
the
highways
bumper
to
bumper
the
freighttrains
engines
nosed
the
cabooses
of
those
in
front
all
other
goods
were
shunted
on
sidings
perishables
rotted
valuables
went
undelivered
all
transportation
was
reserved
for
the
salt
not
only
was
the
undertaking
unprecedented
for
its
magnitude
but
the
urgency
and
the
breakdowns
bottlenecks
shortages
and
disruptions
caused
by
the
grass
itself
added
to
the
formidable
accomplishment
but
the
people
were
aroused
and
aware
of
danger
and
they
put
almost
the
same
effort
behind
the
saltsowing
as
they
would
have
in
turning
out
instruments
of
war
the
sowing
itself
was
in
a
way
anticlimactic
by
the
whim
of
le
ffaçasé
i
went
in
one
of
the
planes
on
the
first
day
of
the
task
my
protests
as
always
proving
futile
i
spent
a
very
boresome
time
flying
backandforth
over
the
same
patch
of
ground
that
is
it
would
have
been
boresome
had
it
not
been
for
the
dangers
involved
for
in
order
to
sow
the
salt
evenly
and
thickly
it
was
necessary
to
fly
low
to
hedgehop
the
pilot
called
it
if
the
parachutejump
had
unnerved
me
the
flying
at
terrific
speed
straight
toward
a
tree
hill
or
electricpowerline
and
then
curving
upward
at
the
last
second
to
miss
them
by
a
whisper
must
have
put
gray
in
my
hair
and
taken
years
from
my
life
the
rivers
washes
and
creeks
on
the
inner
edge
had
been
roughly
dammed
to
lessen
future
erosion
of
the
salt
and
inappropriately
gay
flags
marked
the
boundaries
of
the
area
owing
to
our
speed
the
salt
billowed
out
behind
us
like
powdery
fumes
but
beyond
the
evidence
of
this
smoky
trail
we
might
merely
have
been
a
group
of
madmen
confusedly
searching
for
some
object
lost
upon
the
ground
in
reporting
for
the
it
was
impossible
to
dramatize
the
event
even
the
rewritemen
were
baffled
for
under
the
enormous
head
salt
sown
they
could
not
find
enough
copy
to
carry
over
from
page
one
the
sowing
of
the
salt
went
on
for
weeks
and
the
grass
leaped
forward
as
if
to
meet
it
it
raced
southward
through
long
beach
seal
beach
and
the
deserted
dunes
to
newport
and
balboa
it
came
east
in
a
fury
through
puente
and
monrovia
northeastward
it
moved
into
lancaster
simi
and
piru
only
in
its
course
north
did
the
weed
show
a
slower
pace
by
the
time
we
had
been
forced
to
leave
pomona
for
san
bernardino
it
had
got
no
farther
than
calabasas
and
malibu
the
westward
migration
of
the
american
people
was
abruptly
reversed
those
actually
displaced
by
the
grass
infected
others
through
whose
homes
they
passed
in
their
flight
with
their
own
panic
land
values
west
of
the
rockies
dropped
to
practically
nothing
and
the
rich
farms
of
the
great
plains
were
worth
no
more
than
they
had
been
a
hundred
years
before
people
had
seen
directly
heard
over
the
radio
or
read
in
newspapers
of
the
countless
methods
vainly
used
to
stop
the
grass
and
there
was
little
confidence
in
the
saltband
succeeding
where
other
devices
had
failed
true
there
were
hereandthere
individuals
or
whole
families
or
even
entire
communities
obstinate
enough
to
scorn
flight
but
in
the
opinion
of
most
they
were
like
pigheadedly
trustful
peasants
who
cling
in
the
face
of
all
warning
to
homes
on
the
slopes
of
an
active
volcano
it
was
generally
thought
the
government
itself
in
creating
the
saltband
was
making
no
more
than
a
gesture
whatever
the
validity
of
this
pessimism
the
work
itself
was
impressive
viewed
from
high
in
the
air
only
a
month
after
the
start
it
was
already
visible
after
two
months
it
was
a
thick
glistening
river
winding
over
mountain
desert
and
what
had
been
green
fields
a
white
crystalline
barrier
behind
which
the
country
waited
nervously
when
the
salt
had
been
first
proposed
batches
had
been
dumped
in
proximity
to
the
grass
but
the
quantity
had
been
too
small
to
demonstrate
any
conclusion
and
observers
had
been
immediately
driven
from
the
scene
of
the
experiments
by
the
grass
nevertheless
the
very
inclusiveness
of
these
trials
confirmed
the
doubts
of
the
waiting
country
as
the
narrow
gap
before
the
salt
was
closed
and
the
weed
rolled
to
it
near
capistrano
i
would
like
to
think
of
the
meeting
as
dramatic
heightened
by
inaudible
drumrolls
and
flashes
of
invisible
lightning
actually
the
conflict
was
pedestrian
manipulated
once
more
by
my
tyrant
i
was
stationed
like
other
reporters
and
radiomen
in
a
captive
balloon
for
the
utmost
in
discomfort
and
lack
of
dignity
let
me
recommend
this
ludicrous
invention
cramped
seasickened
inconvenienced
i
do
like
to
mention
this
but
provisions
for
answering
the
calls
of
nature
were
to
say
the
least
inadequate
i
swayed
and
rocked
in
that
inconsiderable
basket
chilled
blinded
by
the
dazzle
of
the
salt
knocked
about
by
gusts
of
irresponsible
wind
and
generally
disgusted
by
the
uselessness
of
my
pursuit
a
telescope
to
the
eye
and
constant
radioreports
from
shuttling
planes
told
of
the
approaching
grass
but
under
the
circumstances
weariness
rather
than
excitement
or
anxiety
was
the
prevailing
emotion
at
last
the
collision
came
the
long
runners
curiously
flat
from
the
air
pushed
their
way
ahead
the
salt
seemed
no
more
to
them
than
bare
ground
concrete
vegetation
or
any
of
the
hundred
obstacles
they
had
traveled
unstutteringly
the
vinelike
stolons
went
forward
a
foot
two
six
ten
no
recoil
no
hesitation
no
recognition
they
were
traversing
a
wall
erected
against
them
behind
these
first
outposts
the
higher
growth
came
on
and
still
farther
off
the
great
bulk
itself
reared
skyward
blotting
out
the
horizon
behind
threatening
inexhaustible
it
seemed
to
prod
its
precursors
to
demand
hungrily
ever
more
and
more
room
to
expand
but
the
creeping
of
the
runners
over
the
first
few
feet
of
salt
dwindled
to
a
stop
this
caused
experienced
observers
like
myself
no
elation
we
had
seen
it
happen
many
times
before
at
the
encountering
of
any
novel
obstacle
and
its
only
effect
had
been
to
make
the
weed
change
its
tactics
in
order
to
overcome
the
obstruction
as
it
did
now
a
second
rank
moved
forward
on
top
of
the
halted
first
a
third
upon
the
second
and
so
on
till
a
living
wall
frowned
down
upon
the
salt
throwing
its
shadow
across
it
for
hundreds
of
ominous
yards
it
towered
erect
and
then
repeating
the
tactic
invariably
successful
it
toppled
forward
to
create
a
bridgehead
from
which
to
launch
new
assaults
the
next
day
new
stolons
emerged
from
the
mass
but
now
for
the
first
time
excitement
seized
us
up
in
our
bobbing
post
of
observation
not
only
were
the
new
runners
visibly
shorter
in
length
but
they
crept
forward
more
slowly
haltingly
as
though
hurt
this
impression
was
generally
discredited
people
were
surfeited
with
optimism
they
felt
our
reports
were
wishful
thinking
their
pessimism
seemed
to
be
confirmed
when
the
weed
repeated
its
action
of
the
day
before
falling
ahead
of
itself
upon
the
salt
and
few
took
stock
in
our
excited
announcements
that
the
grass
had
covered
only
half
the
previous
distance
again
the
probing
fingers
poked
out
again
the
reserves
piled
up
again
the
mass
fell
but
it
fell
far
short
of
a
normal
leap
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
about
it
the
advance
had
been
slowed
almost
stopped
the
salt
was
working
everywhere
along
the
entire
band
the
story
was
the
same
the
grass
rushed
confidently
in
bit
off
great
chunks
then
smaller
then
smaller
until
its
movement
ceased
entirely
that
part
which
embedded
itself
in
the
salt
lost
the
dazzling
green
color
so
characteristic
and
turned
piebald
from
dirty
gray
through
brown
and
yellow
an
appearance
so
familiar
in
its
normal
counterpart
on
lawns
and
vacant
lots
the
encircled
area
filled
up
and
choked
with
the
balked
weed
time
after
time
it
essayed
the
deadly
band
only
to
be
thwarted
the
glistening
fortification
hardly
battered
stood
triumphant
imprisoning
the
invader
within
commentators
in
trembling
voices
broke
the
joyful
news
over
every
receivingset
and
even
the
stodgiest
newspapers
brought
out
their
blackest
type
to
announce
grass
stopped
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
befitted
a
farmer
knowing
something
of
grasses
on
his
own
account
issued
a
proclamation
of
thanksgiving
for
the
end
of
the
peril
which
had
beset
the
country
the
stockmarket
recovered
from
funereal
depths
and
jumped
upward
in
all
the
great
cities
hysterical
rapture
so
heated
the
blood
of
the
people
that
all
restraints
withered
in
frantic
joy
women
were
raped
in
the
streets
dozens
of
banks
were
looted
thousands
of
plateglasswindows
were
smashed
while
millions
of
celebrants
wept
tears
of
proof
ecstasy
torn
tickertapes
made
broadway
impassable
and
the
smallest
whistlestops
spontaneously
revived
the
old
custom
of
uprooting
outhouses
and
perching
them
on
the
church
steeple
i
had
my
own
particular
reason
to
rejoice
coincident
with
the
stoppage
of
the
grass
it
was
so
unreal
so
dreamlike
that
for
many
days
i
had
trouble
convincing
myself
of
its
actuality
it
began
with
a
series
of
agitated
telephone
messages
from
a
firm
of
stockbrokers
asking
for
my
immediate
presence
which
because
of
my
assignments
failed
to
reach
me
for
some
time
so
engrossed
was
i
in
the
events
surrounding
the
victory
over
the
grass
i
could
not
conceive
why
any
broker
would
want
to
see
me
and
so
put
off
my
visit
several
times
till
the
urgency
of
the
calls
began
to
pique
my
curiosity
the
man
who
greeted
me
was
runcible
with
little
strands
of
sickly
hair
twisted
mopwise
over
his
bald
head
his
striped
suit
was
rumpled
the
collar
of
his
shirt
was
wrinkled
and
dots
of
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
upperlip
and
forehead
mr
weener
he
asked
oh
thank
god
thank
god
completely
at
a
loss
i
followed
him
into
his
private
office
you
recall
commissioning
us
when
we
were
located
in
pomona
to
purchase
some
shares
of
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
concentrates
for
your
account
to
tell
the
truth
while
i
had
not
forgotten
the
event
i
had
been
sufficiently
ashamed
of
my
rashness
to
have
pushed
all
recollection
of
the
transaction
to
the
back
of
my
mind
but
i
nodded
confirmingly
no
doubt
you
would
be
willing
to
sell
at
a
handsome
profit
aha
i
thought
the
rise
of
the
market
has
sent
consolidated
pemmican
up
for
once
beyond
its
usual
i
am
probably
a
rich
man
and
this
fellow
wants
to
cheat
me
of
the
fruits
of
my
foresight
you
bought
the
stock
outright
of
course
mr
weener
he
affirmed
in
a
hurt
tone
good
then
i
will
take
immediate
delivery
he
pulled
out
a
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
lip
and
forehead
with
evident
inefficiency
for
the
perspiration
either
remained
or
started
afresh
mr
weener
he
said
i
am
authorized
to
offer
you
six
times
six
times
he
echoed
impressively
the
amount
of
your
original
investment
this
is
an
amazing
return
if
it
was
worth
it
to
him
it
was
worth
it
to
me
i
will
take
immediate
delivery
i
repeated
firmly
and
no
brokerage
fees
involved
he
added
as
one
making
an
unbelievable
concession
i
shook
my
head
mr
weener
he
said
i
have
been
empowered
to
make
you
an
incredible
tender
for
your
stock
not
only
will
the
boardofdirectors
of
consolidated
pemmican
return
to
you
six
times
the
amount
of
your
investment
but
they
will
assign
to
you
over
and
above
this
price
percent
of
the
company
votingstock
it
is
a
magnificent
and
unparalleled
bid
and
i
sincerely
advise
you
to
take
it
i
pressed
my
palms
into
the
back
of
the
chair
i
albert
weener
was
a
capitalist
the
money
involved
already
seemed
negligible
for
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
a
few
thousand
dollars
but
to
own
what
amounted
to
a
controlling
interest
even
in
a
defunct
or
somnolent
corporation
made
me
an
important
person
only
a
reflex
made
me
gasp
i
will
take
immediate
delivery
the
broker
dropped
his
hands
against
his
thighs
mr
weener
you
are
an
acute
man
mr
weener
i
must
confess
the
truth
you
have
bought
more
shares
of
consolidated
pemmican
than
there
are
in
existence
you
not
only
own
the
firm
lock
stock
and
barrel
but
you
owe
yourself
money
he
gave
a
weak
laugh
above
and
beyond
this
mr
weener
through
an
unfortunate
series
of
events
due
to
the
confusion
of
the
times
without
it
such
an
absurd
situation
would
never
have
occurred
several
people
our
own
firm
our
new
york
correspondents
and
the
present
heads
of
consolidated
pemmican
are
liable
to
prosecution
by
the
securities
exchange
commission
we
can
only
throw
ourselves
on
your
mercy
i
waved
this
aside
magnanimously
where
is
my
property
located
well
i
believe
consolidated
pemmican
has
an
office
in
new
york
yes
but
the
factory
the
works
where
is
the
product
made
strictly
speaking
i
understand
active
operations
ceased
back
in
however
there
is
a
plant
somewhere
in
new
jersey
i
think
i
look
it
up
for
you
my
dream
of
wealth
began
fading
as
the
whole
situation
became
clear
and
suspicions
implicit
in
the
peculiar
behavior
of
the
stock
were
confirmed
the
corporation
had
evidently
fallen
into
the
hands
of
unscrupulous
promoters
who
manipulated
for
the
small
but
steady
take
its
fluctuations
on
the
market
afforded
without
attempting
to
operate
the
factory
my
reasoning
ran
they
had
taken
advantage
of
the
low
price
to
double
whatever
they
cared
to
invest
twice
yearly
it
was
a
neat
and
wellshaped
little
racket
and
discovery
as
the
broker
admitted
would
have
exposed
them
to
legal
action
only
my
recklessness
with
the
checks
from
the
and
the
had
broken
the
routine
but
they
had
offered
me
several
thousand
dollars
evidently
in
cold
cash
defunct
or
not
then
the
business
was
presumably
worth
at
least
that
and
if
they
had
employed
the
stock
to
maintain
some
sort
of
income
why
i
could
certainly
learn
to
do
the
same
i
was
an
independent
man
afterall
except
for
the
slightly
embarrassing
detail
of
being
without
current
funds
i
was
also
free
of
le
ffaçasé
and
the
mr
blank
i
said
i
need
some
money
for
immediate
expenses
i
knew
youd
see
things
in
a
sensible
light
weener
i
have
your
check
in
a
minute
you
misunderstand
me
i
have
no
intention
of
giving
up
any
part
of
consolidated
pemmican
ah
no
he
looked
at
me
intently
weener
i
am
not
a
wealthy
man
above
and
beyond
that
since
this
grass
business
started
i
assure
you
any
common
laborer
has
made
more
money
than
i
any
common
laborer
he
repeated
sadly
oh
i
only
need
about
a
thousand
dollars
for
immediate
outlays
just
write
me
a
check
for
that
much
like
a
good
fellow
mr
weener
how
can
we
be
sure
you
wo
call
upon
us
again
for
more
ah
expensemoney
i
drew
myself
up
indignantly
mr
blank
no
one
has
ever
questioned
my
integrity
before
when
i
say
a
thousand
dollars
is
all
the
expensemoney
i
require
why
it
is
all
the
expensemoney
i
require
to
doubt
it
is
to
insult
me
ah
he
said
ah
i
agreed
reluctantly
he
wrote
the
check
and
handed
it
to
me
then
more
amicably
we
settled
the
details
of
the
stock
transfer
and
he
gave
me
the
location
of
my
property
i
went
back
to
the
office
with
the
springy
step
of
a
man
who
acknowledges
no
master
in
my
mind
i
prepared
a
triumph
i
would
wait
even
if
it
took
days
for
the
first
bullying
word
from
le
ffaçasé
and
then
i
would
magnificently
fling
my
resignation
in
his
face
when
the
grass
was
thought
to
be
invincible
miss
francis
as
the
discoverer
of
the
compound
which
started
it
on
its
course
was
the
recipient
of
a
universal
if
grudging
respect
those
whom
the
grass
had
made
homeless
hated
her
and
would
have
overcome
their
natural
feeling
of
protection
toward
a
woman
sufficiently
to
lynch
her
if
they
could
men
like
senator
jones
instinctively
disliked
her
others
like
dr
johnson
detested
her
but
no
one
thought
of
her
lightly
even
when
they
glibly
coupled
the
word
nut
with
her
name
when
it
was
found
the
saltband
worked
miss
francis
immediately
became
the
butt
of
all
the
ridicule
and
contumely
which
could
be
heaped
upon
her
head
what
could
you
expect
of
a
woman
who
meddled
with
things
outside
her
province
since
she
had
asserted
the
grass
would
absorb
everything
its
failure
to
absorb
the
salt
proved
beyond
all
doubt
she
was
an
ignoramus
a
dangerous
charlatan
and
a
crazy
woman
better
locked
up
who
had
destroyed
southern
california
to
her
own
obscure
benefit
the
victory
over
the
grass
became
a
victory
over
miss
francis
of
the
ordinary
gumchewing
moviegoing
maninthestreet
over
the
pretentious
highbrow
she
was
ignominiously
ejected
from
her
on
the
ground
that
it
was
more
needed
for
its
original
use
and
she
was
jeered
at
in
every
vehicle
of
public
expression
in
spite
of
my
natural
chivalry
i
can
not
say
i
pitied
her
in
her
fall
which
she
took
with
an
unbecoming
humility
amounting
to
arrogance
it
was
amazing
how
quickly
viewpoints
returned
to
an
apparent
normality
as
soon
as
the
grass
stopped
at
the
saltband
that
it
still
existed
in
undisputed
possession
of
nearly
all
southern
california
after
dispersing
and
scattering
millions
of
people
all
over
the
country
disturbing
by
its
very
being
a
large
part
of
the
national
economy
was
only
something
read
in
newspapers
an
accepted
fact
to
be
pushed
into
the
farthest
background
of
awareness
now
the
immediate
threat
was
gone
the
salt
patrol
vigilant
for
erosions
or
leachings
a
select
corps
was
alert
night
and
day
to
keep
the
saline
wall
intact
the
general
attitude
if
it
concerned
itself
at
all
with
the
events
of
the
past
half
year
looked
upon
it
merely
as
one
of
those
setbacks
periodically
afflicting
the
country
like
depressions
epidemics
floods
earthquakes
or
other
manmade
or
natural
misfortunes
the
united
states
had
been
a
great
nation
when
los
angeles
was
a
pueblo
of
five
thousand
people
the
movies
could
set
up
in
business
elsewhere
iowans
find
another
spot
for
senescence
the
country
go
on
much
as
usual
one
of
the
first
results
of
the
defeat
of
the
grass
was
the
building
almost
overnight
it
seemed
of
a
great
city
on
the
east
bank
of
the
salton
sea
displaced
realtors
from
the
metropolis
found
the
surrounding
mountains
ideally
suited
for
subdivision
and
laid
out
romantically
named
suburbs
large
enough
to
contain
the
entire
population
of
california
before
the
site
of
the
city
had
been
completely
surveyed
beyond
their
claims
the
memorial

of
eternal

of

all

these
essential
preliminaries
accomplished
the
city
itself
was
laid
out
watermains
installed
and

and

it
was
no
great
feat
to
divert
the
now
aimless
colorado
river
aqueduct
to
the
site
nor
to
erect
thousands
of
prefabricated
houses
the

was
declared
to
be
unequalled

at

and
as
a
gesture
to
those
who
might
suffer
from
homesickness
it
was
called
new
los
angeles
perhaps
in
relief
from
the
fear
and
despair
so
recently
dispelled
new
los
angeles
began
to
boom
from
the
moment
the
mayor
first
handed
the
key
to
a
passing
distinguished
visitor
it
grew
and
spread
as
the
grass
had
grown
and
spread
the
embryonic
skeletons
of
its
unborn
skyline
rivaled
the
height
of
the
green
mass

triumphant
in

its
presses
could
be
set
up
but
i
did
not
move
with
it
for
some
reason
perhaps
intuitively
forewarned
of
my
intention
le
ffaçasé
never
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
humiliate
him
as
i
planned
on
the
contrary
i
received
from
him
a
few
days
before
the
paper
removal
a
silly
and
characteristic
note
since
the
freak
grass
has
been
stopped
it
seems
indicated
other
abnormalities
be
terminated
also
your
usefulness
to
this
paper
always
debatable
is
now
clearly
at
an
end
as
of
this
moment
your
putative
services
will
be
no
longer
required
bitter
vexation
came
over
me
at
having
lost
the
opportunity
to
give
this
bully
a
piece
of
my
mind
and
my
impulse
was
to
go
immediately
to
his
office
and
tell
him
i
scorned
his
petty
paycheck
but
i
reflected
a
man
of
his
nature
would
merely
find
some
tricky
way
of
turning
the
interview
to
his
malicious
satisfaction
and
he
would
know
soon
enough
it
was
the
paper
which
was
suffering
a
loss
and
not
i
started
next
morning
and
drove
eastward
toward
my
property
quite
satisfied
to
leave
behind
forever
the
scenes
of
my
early
struggles
the
west
had
given
me
only
petty
irritations
in
the
east
with
its
older
culture
and
higher
level
of
intelligence
i
looked
forward
to
having
my
worth
appreciated
four
triumphant
everything
i
had
visualized
in
the
broker
office
turned
out
too
pessimistically
accurate
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
concentrates
was
nothing
but
a
mailing
address
in
one
of
the
most
forlorn
of
manhattan
buildings
long
before
jettisoned
by
the
tide
of
commerce
the
factory
no
bigger
than
a
very
small
house
was
a
brokenwindowed
affair
whose
solid
brick
construction
alone
saved
it
from
total
demolition
at
the
playful
hands
of
the
local
children
the
roof
had
long
since
fallen
in
and
symbolical
grass
and
weeds
had
pushed
their
way
through
cracks
in
the
floor
to
flourish
in
a
sickly
and
surreptitious
way
the
whole
concern
until
my
stock
purchase
had
been
the
chattel
and
creature
of
one
button
gwynnet
fles
in
appearance
he
was
such
a
genuine
yankee
lean
and
sharp
with
a
slight
stoop
and
prying
eyes
that
one
quite
expected
a
straw
to
protrude
from
between
his
thin
lips
or
have
him
draw
from
his
pocket
a
wooden
nutmeg
and
offer
it
for
sale
after
getting
to
know
him
i
learned
this
apparent
shrewdness
was
a
pure
defense
mechanism
that
he
was
really
an
artless
and
ingenuous
soul
who
had
been
taught
by
other
hands
the
swindle
he
practiced
for
many
years
and
had
merely
continued
it
because
he
knew
no
way
of
making
an
honest
living
he
was
like
myself
unattached
and
disarmed
whatever
lingering
suspicions
of
him
i
might
have
by
offering
to
share
his
quarters
with
me
until
i
should
have
found
suitable
accommodations
the
poor
fellow
was
completely
at
my
mercy
and
i
not
only
forbore
generously
to
press
my
advantage
but
made
him
vicepresident
of
the
newly
reorganized
concern
permitting
him
to
buy
back
a
portion
of
the
stock
he
had
sold
the
boom
in
the
market
having
sent
our
shares
up
to
an
abnormal
we
flooded
our
brokers
with
selling
offers
at
the
same
time
spreading
rumors
by
no
means
exaggerated
of
the
instability
buying
back
control
when
consolidated
pemmican
reached
its
norm
of
we
made
no
fortunes
on
this
transaction
but
i
was
enabled
to
look
ahead
to
a
year
on
a
more
comfortable
economic
level
than
ever
before
but
it
was
by
no
means
in
my
plans
merely
to
continue
to
milk
the
corporation
i
am
i
hope
not
without
vision
and
i
saw
consolidated
pemmican
under
my
direction
turned
into
an
active
and
flourishing
industry
its
very
decrepitude
i
reasoned
was
my
opportunity
starting
from
scratch
and
working
with
nothing
i
would
build
a
substantial
structure
one
of
the
new
businesses
which
had
sprung
up
was
that
of
personally
conducted
tours
of
the
grass
after
the
experience
of
gootes
and
myself
parachute
landings
had
been
ruled
out
as
too
hazardous
but
someone
happily
thought
of
the
use
of
snowshoes
and
it
was
on
these
clumsy
means
that
tourists
at
a
high
cost
and
at
less
than
snail
pace
tramped
wonderingly
over
the
tamed
menace
my
thought
then
as
i
explained
to
fles
was
to
reactivate
the
factory
and
sell
my
product
to
the
sightseers
food
high
in
calories
and
small
in
bulk
was
a
necessity
on
their
excursions
and
nourishing
pemmican
high
in
protein
quickly
replaced
the
cloying
and
messy
candybar
we
made
no
profit
but
we
suffered
no
loss
and
the
factory
was
in
actual
operation
so
that
no
snoopers
could
ever
accuse
us
of
selling
stock
in
an
enterprise
with
a
purely
imaginary
existence
i
liked
new
york
it
accorded
well
with
my
temperament
and
i
wondered
how
i
had
ever
endured
those
weary
years
far
from
the
center
of
the
country
financial
life
its
theaters
and
its
great
human
drama
give
me
the
old
times
square
and
the
east
fifties
any
day
and
you
can
keep
death
valley
and
functional
architecture
i
was
at
home
at
last
and
i
foresaw
a
future
of
slow
but
sure
progress
toward
a
position
of
eminence
and
respectability
the
undignified
days
of
miss
francis
and
le
ffaçasé
faded
from
my
mind
and
i
was
aware
of
the
grass
only
as
a
cause
for
selling
our
excellent
pemmican
i
wo
say
i
didnt
read
the
occasional
accounts
of
the
weed
appearing
in
or
the
newspapers
or
watch
films
of
it
in
the
movies
with
more
than
common
interest
but
it
was
no
longer
an
engrossing
factor
in
my
life
i
was
now
taken
up
with
larger
concerns
working
furiously
to
expand
my
success
and
for
a
year
after
leaving
the
i
doubt
if
i
gave
it
more
than
a
minute
thought
a
day
the
band
of
salt
remained
an
impregnable
bulwark
where
the
winter
rains
leached
it
new
tons
of
the
mineral
replaced
those
washed
away
constant
observation
showed
no
advance
if
anything
the
edge
of
the
grass
impinging
directly
on
the
salt
was
sullenly
retreating
the
central
bulk
remained
a
vast
obstinate
mass
but
most
people
thought
it
would
somehow
end
by
consuming
itself
if
indeed
this
doom
were
not
anticipated
by
fresh
scatterings
of
salt
striking
at
its
vitals
as
soon
as
the
rains
ceased
no
more
than
any
other
reader
then
was
i
disquieted
by
the
following
small
item
in
my
morning
paper
freak
weed
stirs
speculation
san
diego
mar
ap
an
unusual
patch
of
bermuda
grass
discovered
growing
in
one
of
the
city
parks
flower
beds
here
today
caused
an
excited
flurry
among
observers
reaching
to
a
height
of
nearly
four
feet
and
defying
all
efforts
of
the
park
gardeners
to
uproot
it
the
vivid
green
interloper
reminded
fearful
spectators
of
the
plague
which
over
ran
los
angeles
two
years
ago
scientists
were
reassuring
however
as
they
pointed
out
that
the
giantism
of
the
los
angeles
devil
grass
was
not
transmissible
by
seed
and
that
no
stolons
or
rhizomes
of
the
abnormal
plant
had
any
means
of
traveling
to
san
diego
protected
as
it
is
by
the
band
of
salt
confining
the
los
angeles
growth
i
was
even
more
confident
for
i
had
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
shoots
grown
by
miss
francis
from
seeds
of
the
inoculated
plant
a
genuine
freak
this
time
i
thought
and
promptly
forgot
the
item
would
have
forgotten
it
i
should
say
had
i
not
an
hour
later
received
a
telegram
return
instantly
can
use
your
impressions
of
new
grass
leffacase
i
knew
from
the
fact
he
had
only
used
nine
of
the
ten
words
paid
for
he
considered
the
situation
serious
the
answer
prompted
by
impulse
would
i
knew
not
be
transmitted
by
the
telegraph
company
and
on
second
thought
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
not
take
advantage
of
the
editor
need
business
was
slack
and
i
was
overworked
a
succession
of
petty
annoyances
had
driven
me
almost
to
a
nervous
breakdown
and
a
vacation
at
the
expense
of
the
new
los
angeles
sounded
pleasantly
restful
after
the
serious
work
of
grappling
with
industrial
affairs
of
course
i
did
not
need
their
paltry
few
dollars
but
at
the
moment
some
of
my
assets
were
frozen
and
a
weekly
paycheck
would
be
temporarily
convenient
saving
me
the
bother
of
liquidating
a
portion
of
my
smaller
investments
besides
if
as
was
barely
possible
this
new
growth
was
in
some
unbelievable
way
an
extension
of
the
old
it
would
of
course
ruin
our
sales
of
pemmican
to
the
tourists
and
it
behooved
me
to
be
on
the
spot
i
therefore
answered
consider

wire
transportation
next
day
the
great
transcontinental
plane
pouterpigeoned
along
the
runway
of
the
magnificent
new
los
angeles
airport
i
was
in
no
great
hurry
to
see
the
editor
but
took
a
taxi
instead
to
the
headquarters
of
the
american
alpinists
incorporated
where
there
was
frank
worry
over
the
news
and
acknowledgment
that
no
further
consignments
of
pemmican
would
be
accepted
until
the
situation
became
more
settled
i
left
their
offices
in
a
thoughtful
mood
pausing
only
to
wire
fles
to
unload
as
much
stock
as
he
could
for
even
if
this
were
only
a
temporary
scare
it
would
undoubtedly
affect
the
market
i
finally
drove
to
the
knowing
le
ffaçasé
i
hardly
expected
to
be
received
with
either
cordiality
or
politeness
but
i
was
not
quite
prepared
for
the
actual
salute
a
replica
of
his
original
office
had
been
devised
even
to
the
shabby
letters
on
the
door
and
he
was
seated
in
his
chair
beneath
the
gallery
of
cartoons
he
began
calmly
enough
when
i
entered
speaking
in
a
low
almost
gentle
tone
helping
himself
to
snuff
between
sentences
but
gradually
working
up
into
a
quite
artistic
crescendo
ah
weener
as
you
yourself
would
undoubtedly
put
it
in
your
inimitable
way
a
bad
penny
always
turns
up
i
could
not
say
revertit
suam
for
it
would
invert
a
relationship
the
puke
has
returned
to
the
dog
it
is
a
sad
thought
that
the
listless
exercise
which
eventuated
in
your
begetting
was
indulged
in
by
two
whose
genes
and
chromosomes
united
to
produce
a
male
rather
than
a
female
child
for
think
weener
if
you
had
been
born
a
woman
with
what
gusto
would
you
have
peddled
your
flaccid
flesh
upon
the
city
streets
and
offered
your
miserable
dogsbody
to
the
reluctant
use
of
undiscriminating
customers
you
are
the
paradigmatic
whore
weener
and
i
weep
for
the
physiological
accident
which
condemns
you
to
sell
your
servility
rather
than
your
vulva
ah
weener
it
restores
my
faith
in
human
depravity
to
have
you
around
to
attempt
your
petty
confidence
tricks
on
me
once
more
i
rejoice
to
find
i
had
not
overestimated
mankind
as
long
as
i
can
see
one
aspect
of
it
embodied
in
your
face
and
bad
complexion
as
the
great
gilbert
so
mildly
put
it
i
shall
give
orders
to
triplelock
the
pettycash
to
count
the
stampmoney
diligently
to
watch
all
checks
for
inept
forgery
welcome
back
to
the
and
be
grateful
for
nature
mistakes
since
they
afford
you
employment
as
well
as
existence
but
enough
of
the
friendly
garrulousness
of
an
old
man
whose
powers
are
failing
remove
your
unwholesomelooking
person
from
my
sight
and
convey
the
decrepit
vehicle
of
your
spirit
to
san
diego
it
is
but
a
gesture
i
expect
no
coherent
words
from
your
clogged
and
sputtery
pen
but
while
i
am
sufficiently
like
yourself
to
deceive
the
public
into
thinking
you
have
written
what
they
read
i
am
not
yet
great
enough
scoundrel
to
do
so
without
your
visiting
the
scene
of
your
presumed
labors
go
and
do
not
stop
on
the
way
to
draw
expensemoney
from
the
cashier
for
she
has
strict
orders
not
to
pay
it
jealousy
nothing
but
jealousy
i
thought
first
of
my
literary
ability
and
now
of
my
independence
of
his
crazy
whims
i
turned
my
back
deliberately
and
walked
slowly
out
to
show
my
contempt
for
his
rantings
in
my
heart
now
there
was
little
doubt
the
new
grass
was
an
extension
of
the
old
and
it
didnt
take
more
than
a
single
look
at
the
overrun
park
to
confirm
this
the
same
creeping
runners
growing
perceptibly
from
instant
to
instant
the
same
brilliant
color
the
same
towering
central
mass
gorged
with
food
i
could
have
described
it
line
by
line
and
blade
by
blade
in
my
sleep
i
wasted
no
more
time
gazing
at
it
but
hurried
away
after
hardly
more
than
a
minute
inspection
i
could
take
no
credit
for
my
perceptivity
since
everyone
in
san
diego
knew
as
well
as
i
that
this
was
no
duplicate
freak
but
the
same
the
identical
the
fearsome
grass
but
a
quite
understandable
conspiracy
had
been
tacitly
entered
into
the
knowledge
was
successfully
hushed
until
property
could
be
disposed
of
before
it
became
quite
worthless
the
conspiracy
defeated
itself
however
with
so
many
frantic
sellers
competing
against
each
other
and
the
news
was
out
by
the
time
the
first
of
my
new
columns
appeared
in
the
the
first
question
which
occurred
to
those
of
us
calm
enough
to
escape
panic
was
how
had
the
weed
jumped
the
saltband
it
was
answered
simultaneously
by
many
learned
professors
whose
desire
to
break
into
print
and
share
the
front
page
with
the
terrible
grass
overcame
their
natural
academic
reticence
there
was
no
doubt
that
originally
the
peculiar
voracity
of
the
inoculated
plant
had
not
been
inherited
but
it
was
equally
uncontroverted
that
somehow
during
the
period
it
had
been
halted
by
the
salt
a
mutation
had
happened
and
now
every
wind
blowing
over
the
weed
carried
seeds
no
longer
innocent
but
bearing
embryos
of
the
destroyer
terror
ran
before
the
grass
like
a
herald
the
shock
felt
when
los
angeles
went
down
was
multiplied
tenfold
now
there
was
no
predictable
course
men
could
shape
their
actions
to
avoid
no
longer
was
it
possible
to
watch
and
chart
the
daily
advance
of
a
single
body
so
a
partially
accurate
picture
could
be
formed
of
what
might
be
expected
tomorrow
instead
of
one
mass
there
were
countless
ones
at
the
whim
of
a
chance
wind
or
bird
seeds
might
alight
in
an
area
apparently
safe
and
overwhelm
a
community
miles
away
from
the
living
glacier
no
place
was
out
of
range
of
the
attack
no
square
foot
of
land
kept
any
value
the
stockmarket
crashed
and
i
congratulated
myself
on
having
sent
fles
orders
to
sell
a
day
or
two
later
the
exchanges
were
closed
and
shortly
after
the
banks
business
came
to
a
practical
standstill
the
great
industries
shut
down
and
all
normal
transactions
of
daily
life
were
conducted
by
means
of
barter
for
the
first
time
in
threequarters
of
a
century
the
farmer
was
topdog
his
eggs
and
milk
his
wheat
and
corn
and
potatoes
he
could
exchange
for
whatever
he
fancied
and
on
his
own
terms
fortunately
for
starving
citydwellers
his
appetite
for
manufactured
articles
and
for
luxuries
was
insatiable
their
automobiles
furcoats
costumejewelry
washingmachines
files
of
the
and
their
periodfurniture
left
the
city
flat
for
the
farm
to
come
back
in
the
more
acceptable
form
of
steaks
butter
fowl
and
turnips
the
whole
elaborate
structure
of
money
and
credit
seemed
to
disappear
overnight
like
some
tenuous
dream
the
frenzied
actions
of
the
humanbeings
had
no
effect
on
the
grass
the
saltband
still
stood
inviolate
as
did
smaller
counterparts
hastily
laid
around
the
earlier
of
the
seedborne
growths
but
everywhere
else
the
grass
swept
ahead
like
a
tidalwave
its
speed
seemingly
increased
by
the
months
of
repression
behind
it
swallowed
san
diego
in
a
gulp
and
leaped
beyond
the
united
states
to
take
in
baja
california
in
one
swift
downward
lick
it
sprang
upon
the
deserts
whose
lack
of
water
was
no
deterrent
now
always
sending
little
groups
ahead
like
paratroopers
or
fifthcolumnists
they
established
positions
till
the
main
body
came
up
and
consolidated
them
it
curled
up
the
high

this

did
not
mean
that
i
failed
to
follow
each

of
the

such
a
course
would
have
been
quite
impossible
since
its
every

affected
the
life

fortune
of
every

by

strange

it
spared
the

whether
it

some
disinclination

it

whether
it
was
sheer
accident

this

raised
queer
hopes
in

perhaps
their

be

the

of
the

with

not

the

then
the

abandoned
realestate

although
these

restored
a
similitude

it

a
feeble
imitation
of
its

self
many

almost
completely

at

a
reckless

seized
upon

the

coming
so
what
good
was
the

on

they
were

the
grass
was
coming
so
why
gather
together
the

to
meet
the

on
the

the

was
coming
what
was
the
use
of
depositing

probably
go
bust
tomorrow
the

would
have
been
worse
had
it
not

other
stern

the

tremendous

the
vanishing

little
suddenly
the

so
long
boasted
of
being
the
richest
country
in

found
itself
desperately
poor

little
to
relieve
the
suffering
of
the

deaths

mounted
and
the

crushed

of

there
was
a

brother
paul
now
on

repeated
his
exhortations
to
all
christians
urging
them
to
join
their
savior
in
the
midst
of
the

there
was
great
agitation
for
restraining
him
more
reserved
pastors
pointed
out
that
he
was
responsible
for
increasing
the
national
suicide
rate
but
the
federal
communications
commission
took
no
action
against
him
possibly
because
as
some
said
it
was
cheaper
to
let
a
percentage
of
the
surplus
population
find
an
ecstatic
death
than
to
feed
it
on
political
maps
the
united
states
had
lost
not
one
foot
of

population
statistics
showed
it
harbored
as
many
men
women
and

as
before
not
one
tenth
of
the
national
wealth
had
been
destroyed
by
the
grass
or
a
sixth
of
the
country
given
up
to
it
yet
it
had
done
what
seven
wars
and
many
vicissitudes
had
failed
to
do
it
brought
the
country
to
the
nadir
of
its
existence
to
a
hopeless
despondency
unknown
at
valley
forge
at
this
desperate
point
the
federal
government
decided
it
could
no
longer
temporize
with
the
clamor
for
using
atomic
power
against
the
grass
all
the
arguments
so
weighty
at
first
became
insignificant
against
the
insolent
facts
it
was
announced
in
a
washington
pressconference
that
as
soon
as
arrangements
could
be
made
the
most
fearful
of
all
weapons
would
be
employed
no
one
doubted
the
atomicbomb
would
do
the
trick
finally
and
conclusively
the
searing
volcanic
heat
irresistible
penetration
efficient
destructiveness
and
the
aftermath
of
apocalyptic
radiation
promised
the
end
of
the
grass
when
i
say
no
one
of
course
i
mean
no
clearthinking
person
of
vision
with
his
feet
on
the
ground
who
didnt
go
deliberately
out
of
his
way
to
look
for
the
dark
side
of
things
naturally
there
were
crackpots
as
there
always
are
who
opposed
the
use
of
the
bomb
for
various
untenable
reasons
and
among
them
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
miss
francis
though
her
pessimistic
and
unpopular
opinions
had
been
discredited
time
and
again
the
newspapers
possibly
to
enliven
their
now
perpetually
gloomy
columns
with
a
little
humor
gave
some
space
to
interviews
which
with
variations
predicated
on
editorial
policy
ran
something
like
this
will
you
tell
our
readers
what
you
think
of
using
the
atom
bomb
against
the
grass
i
think
it
at
the
very
best
a
waste
of
time
at
the
worst
extremely
dangerous
in
what
way
miss
francis
in
every
way
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
young
man
or
radioactivity
can
you
conceive
among
other
possibilities
and
mind
this
is
merely
a
possibility
a
quite
unscientific
guess
merely
advanced
in
the
vain
hope
of
avoiding
one
more
folly
of
the
whole
mass
becoming
radioactive
squaring
or
cubing
its
speed
of
growth
or
perhaps
throwing
before
it
a
lethal
band

wide
mind
you
i
not
anticipating
any
of
this
not
even
saying
it
is
a
probability
but
these
or
similar
hazards
may
well
attend
this
illconsidered
venture
you
speak
strongly
miss

none
of
the
rather
fantastic
things
you
predict
followed
hiroshima
nagasaki
or
bikini
in
the
first
place
i
tried
with
apparent
unsuccess
to
make
it
clear
i
not
predicting
i
am
merely
mentioning
possibilities
in
the
second
place
we
do
know
exactly
what
were
the
aftereffects
of
the
previous
bombs
because
of
a
general
inability
to
correlate
cause
and
effect
i
only
know
that
in
every
case
the
use
of
the
atomic
bomb
has
been
followed
at
greater
or
lesser
intervals
by
tidal
waves
earthquakes
and
other
phenomena
now
do
not
quote
me
as
saying
the
hilo
tidal
wave
was
the
result
of
the
nagasaki
bomb
or
the
chicagku
earthquake
the
bikini
for
i
didnt
i
only
point
out
that
they
followed
at
roughly
equal
intervals
then
you
are
opposed
to
the
bomb
common
sense
is
not
that
that
will
be
a
deterrent
what
would
you
substitute
for
it
if
i
had
a
counteragent
to
the
grass
ready
i
would
not
be
wasting
time
talking
to
reporters
i
am
working
on
one
when
it
is
found
by
me
or
another
it
will
be
a
true
counteragent

the

and

on
the
few
reputable

who
condescended
to

the

sundaysupplement

without

indeed

the

to
be
hypnotized
then
or
made
to
change
its

through
judicious
sessions
with
psychoanalysts
stationed
along
its
periphery
whether
because
of
miss
francis
prophesies
or
not
it
would
be
futile
to
deny
that
a
certain
amount
of
trepidation
accompanied
the
decision
to
use
the
bomb
residents
of
arizona
wanted
it
dropped
in
california
san
franciscans
urged
the
poetic
justice
and
great
utility
of
applying
it
to
the
very
spot
where
the
growth
originated
all
were
in
favor
of
the
devastation
at
the
farthest
possible
distance
from
themselves
partly
in
response
to
this
pressure
and
partly
in
consideration
of
other
factors
including
the
possibility
of
international
repercussions
the
commission
to
combat
dangerous
vegetation
decided
on
one
of
the
least
awesome
bombs
in
the
catalogue
just
a
little
bomb
hardly
more
than
a
toy
a
plaything
the
very
smallest
practicable
ought
to
allay
all
fears
and
set
everyone
mind
at
rest
if
it
were
effective
a
bigger
one
could
be
employed
or
numbers
of
smaller
ones
this
much
being
settled
there
was
still
the
question
of
where
to
initiate
the
attack
edge
or
heart
once
more
there
was
controversy
but
it
lacked
the
enthusiasm
remembered
by
veterans
of
the
salt
argument
a
certain
lassitude
in
debate
was
evident
as
though
too
much
excitement
had
been
dissipated
on
earlier
hopes
leaving
none
for
this
one
there
was
little
grumbling
or
soreness
when
the
decision
was
finally
confirmed
to
let
fall
the
bomb
on
what
had
been
long
beach
when
i
read
of
the
elaborate
preparations
being
made
to
cover
the
great
event
of
the
special
writers
experts
broadcasters
cameramen
i
was
thankful
indeed
i
was
no
longer
a
newspaperman
arbitrarily
to
be
ordered
aloft
or
sent
aboard
some
erratic
craft
offshore
on
the
bare
chance
i
might
catch
a
comprehensive
or
distinctive
enough
glance
of
the
action
to
repay
an
editor
for
my
discomfort
instead
i
sat
contentedly
in
my
apartment
and
listened
to
the
radio
whether
our
expectations
had
been
too
high
or
whether
all
the
eyewitnesses
became
simultaneously
inept
i
must
say
the
spot
broadcast
and
later
newspaper
and
magazine
accounts
were
uniformly
disappointing
it
was
like
the
hundredth
repetition
of
an
oftentold
story
the
flash
the
chaos
the
mushroomcloud
the
reverberation
were
all
in
precise
order
nothing
new
nothing
startling
and
i
imagine
the
rest
of
the
country
as
i
did
turned
away
from
the
radio
with
a
distinct
feeling
of
having
been
let
down
first
observation
through
telescope
and
by
airplanes
keeping
a
necessarily
cautious
distance
showed
the
bomb
had
destroyed
a
patch
of
vegetation
about
as
large
as
had
been
expected
though
not
spectacular
the
bombing
had
apparently
been
effective
on
a
comparatively
small
segment
and
it
was
anticipated
that
as
soon
as
it
was
safe
to
come
close
and
confirm
this
the
action
would
be
repeated
on
a
larger
scale
while
hundreds
more
of
the
baby
bombs
as
they
were
now
affectionately
called
were
ordered
and
preparations
made
systematically
to
blast
the
grass
out
of
existence
the
aerial
observers
kept
swooping
in
closer
and
closer
with
cameras
trained
to
catch
every
aspect
of
the
damage
there
was
no
doubt
an
area
of
approximately
four
square
miles
had
been
utterly
cleaned
of
the
weed
and
a
further
zone
nine
times
that
size
had
been
smashed
and
riven
the
grass
there
torn
and
mangled
in
all
probability
deprived
of
life
successive
reconnoitering
showed
no
changes
in
the
annihilated
center
but
on
the
tenth
day
after
the
explosion
a
most
startling
observation
of
the
peripheral
region
was
made
it
had
turned
a
brilliant
orange
not
a
brown
or
yellow
or
any
of
the
various
shades
of
decay
which
bermuda
in
its
original
form
took
on
at
times
but
a
glowing
and
unearthly
jewellike
blaze
the
strange
color
was
strictly
confined
to
the
devastated
edge
of
the
bombcrater
airmen
flying
low
could
see
its
distinction
from
the
rest
of
the
mass
clear
and
sharp
in
the
center
nothing
around
it
the
weird
orange
and
beyond
the
usual
and
accustomed
green
but
on
second
look
not
quite
usual
not
quite
accustomed
the
inoculated
grass
had
always
been
a
shade
or
two
more
intense
than
ordinary
this
just
beyond
the
orange
was
still
more
brilliant
not
only
that
but
it
behaved
unaccountably
it
writhed
and
spumed
upward
in
great
clumps
culminating
in
enormous
overhanging
caps
inevitably
suggesting
the
mushroomcloud
of
the
bomb
the
grass
had
always
been
cautious
of
the
sea
now
the
dazzling
growth
plunged
into
the
saltwater
with
frenzy
leaping
and
building
upon
itself
great
masses
of
vegetation
piers
causeways
isthmuses
of
grass
offered
the
illusion
of
growing
out
of
the
ocean
bottom
linking
themselves
to
the
land
extending
too
late
the
lost
coast
far
out
into
the
pacific
but
this
was
far
from
the
last
aftereffect
though
attention
had
naturally
been
diverted
from
the
orange
band
to
the
eccentric
behavior
of
the
contiguous
grass
it
did
not
go
unobserved
and
about
a
week
after
its
first
change
of
color
it
seemed
to
be
losing
its
unnatural
hue
and
turning
green
again
not
the
green
of
the
great
mass
nor
of
the
queer
periphery
nor
of
uninspired
devilgrass
it
was
a
green
unknown
in
living
plant
before
a
glassy
translucent
green
the
green
of
a
cathedral
window
in
the
moonlight
by
contrast
the
widening
circle
about
it
seemed
subdued
and
orderly
the
fantastic
shapes
the
tortured
writhings
the
unnatural
extensions
into
the
ocean
were
no
longer
manifest
instead
for
miles
around
the
ravaged
spot
where
the
bomb
had
been
dropped
the
grass
burst
into
bloom
purple
flowers
appeared
not
the
usual
muddy
brown
faintly
mauve
but
a
redviolet
brilliant
and
clear
the
period
of
generation
was
abnormally
shortened
seed
was
borne
almost
instantly
but
the
seed
was
a
sport
it
did
not
droop
and
detach
itself
and
sink
into
the
ground
instead
tufted
and
fluffy
like
dandelion
seed
or
thistledown
it
floated
upward
in
incredible
quantities
so
that
for
hundreds
of
miles
the
sky
was
obscured
by
this
cloud
bearing
the
germ
of
the
inoculated
grass
it
drifted
easily
and
the
winds
blew
it
beyond
the
confines
of
the
creeping
parent
it
lit
on
spots
far
from
the
threatening
advance
and
sprouted
overnight
into
great
clumps
of
devilgrass
all
the
anxiety
and
panic
which
had
gone
before
was
trivial
in
the
face
of
this
new
threat
now
the
advance
was
no
longer
calculable
or
predictable
at
any
moment
a
spot
apparently
beyond
danger
might
be
threatened
and
attacked
immediately
men
remembered
the
exotic
growth
of
flowers
which
came
up
to
hide
some
of
london
scars
after
the
blitz
and
the
lush
plantlife
observed
in
hiroshima
why
hadnt
the
allwise
scientists
remembered
and
taken
them
into
account
before
the
bomb
was
dropped
why
had
they
been
blind
to
this
obvious
danger
fortunately
the
anger
and
terror
were
assuaged
observers
soon
discovered
the
mutants
were
sterile
incapable
of
reproduction
more
than
that
though
the
new
clumps
spread
and
flourished
and
grew
rapidly
they
lacked
the
tenacity
and
stamina
of
the
parent
eventually
they
withered
and
dwindled
and
were
in
the
end
no
different
from
the
uninoculated
grass
now
a
third
change
was
seen
in
the
color
band
the
green
turned
distinctly
blue
and
the
sharp
line
between
it
and
the
rest
of
the
weed
vanished
as
the
blueness
shaded
out
imperceptibly
over
miles
into
the
green
the
barren
spot
made
by
the
bomb
was
covered
the
whole
mass
of
vegetation
thousands
of
square
miles
of
it
was
animated
by
a
surging
new
vigor
so
that
eastward
and
southward
the
rampant
tentacles
jumped
to
capture
and
occupy
great
new
swaths
of
territory
triumphantly
brother
paul
castigated
the
bombardiers
and
urged
repentance
for
the
blasphemy
to
avert
further
welldeserved
punishment

doors
on
special
days
of
humiliation
and
fasting
but
for
most
of
the
people
there
was
a
general
feeling
of
relief
the
ultimate
in
weapons
had
been
used
the
grass
would
wear
itself
out
in
good
time
meanwhile
they
were
thankful
the
effect
of
the
atomicbomb
had
been
no
worse
if
anything
the
spirit
of
the
country
despite
the
great
setback
was
better
after
the
dropping
of
the
bomb
than
before
i
was
so
fascinated
by
the
entire
episode
that
i
stayed
by
my
radio
practically
all
my
waking
hours
much
to
the
distress
of
button
fles
every
report
every
scrap
of
news
interested
me
so
it
was
that
i
caught
an
item
in
a
newscast
probably
unheard
by
most
or
smiled
aside
if
heard
organ
of
the
russian
poultry
farmers
editorialized
a
certain
imperialist
nation
unscrupulously
pilfering
the
technical
advance
of
soviet
science
is
using
atomic
power
contrary
to
international
law
this
is
intolerable
to
a
people
embracing
of
the
earth
surface
and
the
poultrymen
of
the
collective
red
have
unanimously
protested
against
such
capitalist
aggression
which
can
only
be
directed
against
the
soviet

great
suvarov

twentyfour
hours
after
the
ministerial
council
of
the
union
of
soviet
republics
declared
a
state
of
war
existed
through
no
action
of
its
own
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
at
first
the
people
were
incredulous
they
could
not
believe
the
radio
reports
were
anything
but
a
ghastly
mistake
an
accidental
garbling
produced
by
atmospheric
conditions
historians
had
told
them
from
their
schooldays
of
traditional
friendship
the
russian
fleet
came
to
the
atlantic
coast
in
to
escape
revolutionary
infection
but
the
americans
innocently
took
it
as
a
gesture
of
solidarity
in
the
civil
war
the
communist
party
had
repeated
with
the
monotony
of
a
popular
hymntune
at
a
revival
that
the
soviet
union
asked
only
to
be
let
alone
that
it
had
no
belligerent
designs
that
it
was
as
lincoln

of
the
modest
farmer

agitators
were
promptly
jailed
for
saying
the
soviet
union
wasnt
if
it
ever
had
been
a
socialist
country
its
imperialism
stemming
directly
from
its
rejection
of
the
socialist
idea
as
a
great
imperialist
power
bursting
with
natural
resources
it
must
inevitably
conflict
with
the
other
great
imperialist

in

had
done
what
we
could
to
thwart
russian
ambition
now
they
seized
the
opportunity
to

in

they
had
been
overweeningly
sure
this

or
great
fleets
of

would
sweep
across
the
skies
and
devastate
the
belligerents
within
three
hours
of

course
would
be

not

would
remain

in

nor
hardly
a

alive
but
three
hours
after
elmer
davis
heading
an
immediately
revived
office
of

information
announced
the
news
in
his
famous
monotone
new
york
and
chicago
and
seattle
were
still
standing
and
so
three
days
later
were
moscow
and
leningrad
and
vladivostok
astonishment
and
unbelief
were
nationwide
the
empire
state
the
palmolive
building
the
mark
hopkins
all
still
intact
only
when
commentators
rummaging
nervously
among
old
manuscripts
recalled
the
solemn
gentlemen
agreement
never
to
use
heavierthanaircraft
of
any
description
should
the
unthinkable
war
come
did
the
public
give
a
heartfelt
sigh
of
relief
of
course
both
the
soviet
union
and
the
united
states
were
nations
of
unstained
honor
and
rather
than
recall
their
pledged
word
would
have
suffered
the
loss
of
a
dozen
wars
everyone
breathed
easier
necks
relaxed
from
the
strain
of
scanning
the
skies
there
would
be
neither
bombs
rockets
nor
guided
missiles
in
this
war
as
soon
as
the
conviction
was
established
that
the
country
was
safe
from
the
memory
of
hiroshima
panic
gave
place
to
relief
and
for
the
first
time
some
of
the
old
spirit
was
manifest
there
was
no
rush
to
recruitingstations
but
selectiveservice
operating
smoothly
except
in
the
extreme
west
took
care
of
mobilization
and
the
war
was
accepted
if
not
with
enthusiasm
at
least
as
an
inescapable
fate
the
coming
of
the
grass
had
not
depleted
nor
unbalanced
the
resources
beyond
readjustment
but
it
had
upset
the
sensitive
workings
of
the
national
economy
this
was
tolerable
by
a
sick
land
and
the
grass
had
made
the
nation
sick
in
peacetime
but
war
is
the
health
of
the
state
and
the
president
moved
quickly
all
large
industries
were
immediately
seized
as
were
the
mines
and
means
of
transportation
a
basic
fiftyfivehour
workweek
was
imposed
a
new
chief
of
staff
and
of
naval
operations
was
appointed
and
the
young
men
went
off
to
camp
to
train
either
for
implementing
or
repelling
invasion
then
came
a
period
of
quiet
during
which
both
countries
attacked
each
other
ferociously
over
the
radio
in
the
socialistic
orgy
of
nationalizing
business
i
was
fortunate
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
concentrates
was
left
in
the
hands
of
private
initiative
better
than
that
it
had
not
been
tied
down
and
made
helpless
by
the
multiplicity
of
regulations
hampering
the
few
types
of
endeavor
remaining
nominally
free
of
regimenting
bureaucracy
opportunity
long
prepared
for
and
not
i
trust
undeserved
was
before
me
in
the
pass
to
which
our
country
had
come
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
be
of
most
service
supplying
our
armed
forces
with
fieldrations
such
an
unselfish
and
patriotic
desire
one
would
think
easy
of
realization
as
i
so
innocently
did
and
i
immediately
began
interviewing
numberless
officers
of
the
quartermaster
department
to
further
this
worthy
aim
i
certainly
believe
every
corporation
must
have
its
rules
otherwise
executives
would
be
besieged
all
day
by
timewasters
the
united
states
government
is
surely
a
corporation
as
i
always
used
to
say
in
advocating
election
of
a
business
administration
and
standard
procedures
and
regulations
are
essential
still
there
ought
to
be
a
limit
to
the
number
and
length
of
questionnaires
to
fill
out
and
the
number
of
underlings
to
interview
before
a
serious
businessman
can
get
to
see
a
responsible
official
after
making
three
fruitless
trips
to
washington
and
getting
exhaustively
familiar
with
countless
tantalizing
waitingrooms
i
became
impatient
the
man
i
needed
to
see
was
a
brigadier
general
thario
but
after
wasting
valuable
days
and
hours
i
was
no
nearer
reaching
him
than
in
the
beginning
i
had
filled
out
the
necessary
forms
and
stated
the
nature
of
my
business
so
often
i
began
to
be
alarmed
lest
my
hand
refuse
to
write
anything
else
and
i
be
condemned
for
the
rest
of
my
life
to
repeat
the
idiotic
phrases
called
for
in
the
blank
spaces
i
am
afraid
i
must
have
raised
my
voice
in
expressing
my
exasperation
to
the
young
lady
who
acted
as
receptionist
and
barrier
at
any
rate
she
looked
startled
and
i
think
pressed
a
button
on
her
desk
a
pinkfaced
whitemustached
gentleman
came
hastily
through
the
door
behind
her
the
jacket
of
his
uniform
fitted
snugly
at
the
waist
and
his
bald
head
was
sunburnt
and
shiny
what
this
what
this
going
on
here
i
saw
the
single
star
on
his
shoulderstraps
and
ventured
general
thario
he
hid
his
white
mustache
with
a
forefinger
pink
as
his
cheeks
yes
yes
but
you
must
have
an
appointment
to
speak
to
me
that
the
rule
you
know
must
have
an
appointment
he
appeared
extremely
nervous
and
harassed
his
eyes
darting
back
to
the
refuge
of
his
office
but
he
was
evidently
held
to
the
spot
by
whatever
distress
animated
his
receptionist
general
thario
i
persisted
firmly
i
quite
appreciate
your
viewpoint
but
i
have
been
trying
for
days
to
get
such
an
appointment
with
you
on
a
matter
of
vital
concern
and
i
have
been
put
off
every
time
by
what
i
can
only
describe
as
redtape
i
am
sorry
to
say
so
general
thario
but
i
must
repeat
redtape
he
looked
more
worried
than
before
and
his
eyes
ranged
over
the
room
for
some
escape
know
just
how
you
feel
he
muttered
know
just
how
you
feel
horrible
stuff
swaddled
in
it
here
simply
swaddled
in
it
strangled
he
cleared
his
throat
as
though
to
disembarrass
it
of
a
garrote
but
uh
hang
it
mr
weener
albert
weener
president
of
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
concentrates
incorporated
well
you
know
weener
man
your
position
appreciate
absolute
necessity
certain
amount
of
routine
keep
the
cranks
out
otherwise
swarming
with
them
simply
swarming
wartime
precautions
must
excuse
me
now
terribly
rushed
glad
to
have
met
swallowing
the
rest
of
the
sentence
and
putting
his
hand
over
his
mouth
lest
he
should
inadvertently
regurgitate
it
he
started
for
his
office
general
thario
i
pleaded
a
moment
consider
our
positions
reversed
i
have
long
since
established
my
identity
my
responsibility
i
want
nothing
for
myself
i
am
here
doing
a
patriotic
duty
surely
enough
of
the
routine
you
mention
has
been
complied
with
to
permit
me
to
speak
to
you
for
five
or
ten
minutes
do
for
one
moment
as
i
say
general
and
put
yourself
in
my
place
think
of
the
discouragement
you
as
a
citizen
would
feel
to
be
hampered
perhaps
more
than
is
necessary
he
took
his
hand
down
from
his
mouth
and
looked
at
me
out
of
blue
eyes
so
pale
as
to
be
almost
colorless
but
hang
it
you
know
mr
weener
highly
irregular
sympathize
completely
but
consider
do
like
being
put
in
such
a
position
why
do
you
come
back
in
the
morning
general
i
urged
flushed
with
victory
give
me
ten
minutes
now
he
collapsed
know
just
how
you
feel
wanted
to
be
out
in
the
field
myself
no
desk
soldier
lot
of
nonsense
if
you
ask
me
come
in
come
in
in
his
office
i
explained
the
sort
of
contract
i
was
anxious
to
secure
and
assured
him
of
my
ability
to
fulfill
its
terms
but
i
could
see
his
mind
was
not
intent
upon
the
specifications
for
fieldrations
looking
up
occasionally
from
a
dejected
study
of
his
knees
he
kept
inquiring
in
elliptical
practically
verbless
questions
how
many
men
my
plant
employed
whether
i
had
a
satisfactory
manager
and
if
a
knowledge
of
chemistry
was
essential
to
the
manufacture
of
concentrates
evading
or
discussing
in
the
vaguest
terms
the
actual
business
in
hand
however
he
seemed
very
friendly
and
affable
toward
me
personally
once
the
chill
air
of
the
waitingroom
had
been
left
behind
and
as
button
fles
had
advised
me
insistently
to
entertain
without
regard
to
expense
any
officials
with
whom
i
came
in
contact
i
thought
it
politic
to
invite
him
to
dinner
he
demurred
at
first
but
at
length
accepted
instructing
his
secretary
to
phone
his
wife
not
to
expect
him
home
early
i
suggested
mrs
thario
join
us
but
he
shook
his
head
muttering
no
place
for
women
mr
weener
no
place
for
women
whether
this
referred
to
washington
or
the
restaurant
where
we
were
going
or
to
his
life
largely
was
not
clear
wartime
washington
was
in
its
usual
chaotic
turmoil
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
a
taxi
so
we
had
to
walk
but
the
general
did
not
seem
at
all
averse
to
the
exercise
it
seemed
to
me
he
rather
enjoyed
returning
the
salutes
with
the
greatest
punctilio
and
flourish
on
our
way
we
came
to
one
of
the
capital
most
famous
taverns
and
i
thought
i
detected
a
hesitancy
in
his
stride
now
i
am
not
a
drinking
man
myself
i
limit
my
imbibing
to
an
occasional
glass
of
beer
on
account
of
the
yeast
it
contains
which
i
consider
beneficial
i
hope
however
i
am
no
prig
or
puritan
and
so
i
asked
casually
if
he
would
care
to
stop
in
for
an
appetizer
well
now
you
mention
it
mr
weener
hum
fact
is
do
mind
if
i
do
while
i
confined
myself
to
my
medicinal
beverage
the
general
conducted
a
most
remarkable
raid
on
the
bar
as
i
have
hinted
he
was
in
demeanor
a
mild
appearing
if
not
indeed
a
timid
man
in
the
course
of
an
conversation
no
word
of
profanity
such
as
is
affected
by
many
military
men
had
crossed
his
lips
the
framed
photograph
of
his
wife
and
daughters
on
his
desk
and
his
respectful
references
to
women
indicated
he
was
not
the
type
of
soldier
who
lusts
for
rapine
but
seated
before
that
dull
mahogany
bar
whatever
inhibitions
whatever
conventional
shackles
whatever
selfdenials
and
repressions
had
been
inculcated
fell
from
him
swiftly
and
completely
he
barked
his
orders
at
the
bartender
who
seemed
to
know
him
very
well
as
though
he
were
addressing
a
parade
formation
of
badly
disciplined
troops
not
only
did
general
thario
drink
enormously
but
he
broke
all
the
rules
i
had
ever
heard
laid
down
about
drinking
he
began
with
a
small
squat
glass
which
i
believe
is
called
an
oldfashioned
glass
containing
half
cognac
and
half
ryewhisky
he
followed
this
with
a
tall
tumbler
twelve
full
ounces
none
of
your
eightounce
thimbles
not
trifled
with
of
champagne
into
which
the
bartender
upon
his
instructions
and
under
his
critical
eye
poured
two
jiggers
of
tropical
rum
then
he
wiped
his
lips
with
a
handkerchief
pulled
from
his
sleeve
and
began
with
a
serious
air
on
a
combination
of
benedictine
and
tequila
the
more
he
imbibed
the
longer
more
complete
and
more
coherent
his
sentences
became
he
dropped
his
harassed
air
his
abdomen
receded
his
chest
expanded
bringing
to
my
notice
for
the
first
time
the
rows
of
ribbons
which
confirmed
his
earlier
assertion
that
he
was
not
a
desk
soldier
he
was
sipping
curaçao
liberally
laced
with
applejack
when
he
suggested
we
have
our
dinner
sent
in
rather
than
leave
this
comfortable
spot
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
mr
weener
i
going
to
call
you
albert
if
you
do
mind
i
said
i
didnt
mind
with
all
the
heartiness
at
my
command
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
albert
i
have
devoted
my
unfortunate
life
to
two
arts
the
military
and
the
potatory
as
you
may
have
noticed
most
of
the
miserable
creatures
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
bar
adopt
one
of
two
reprehensible
courses
either
they
treat
drinking
as
though
the
aim
of
blending
liquids
were
to
imitate
some
french
chef
fiddlefaddle
a
dash
of
bitters
a
squirt
of
orange
an
olive
cherry
or
onion
wrenched
from
its
proper
place
in
the
saladbowl
a
twist
of
lemonpeel
sprig
of
mint
or
lump
of
sugar
and
an
eyedropperful
of
whisky
or
else
they
embrace
the
opposite
extreme
of
vulgarity
and
gulp
whatever
rotgut
is
thrust
at
them
to
addle
their
undiscerning
brains
and
atrophy
their
undiscriminating
palates
either
practice
is
foreign
to
my
nature
and
philosophy
i
believe
the
happiest
combinations
of
liquors
are
simple
ones
containing
no
more
than
two
ingredients
each
of
which
should
be
noble
that
is
to
say
drinkable
in
its
own
right
he
raised
his
fresh
glass
containing
brandy
and
arrack
no
doubt
you
have
observed
a
catholicity
in
my
taste
i
range
through
the
whole
gamut
from
usquebaugh
to
sake
though
during
the
present
conflict
for
obvious
patriotic
reasons
i
cross
vodka
from
my
list
while
as
a
man
born
south
of
the
line
sir
i
leave
gin
to
nigras
i
must
say
though
somewhat
startled
by
his
manner
of
imbibing
i
was
inclined
to
like
general
thario
but
i
was
impatient
to
discuss
the
matter
of
a
contract
for
consolidated
pemmican
every
time
i
attempted
to
bring
the
subject
round
to
it
he
waved
me
grandly
aside
dinner
he
confirmed
when
the
waiters
brought
in
their
trays
yes
no
drink
is
complete
without
a
little
bit
of
the
right
food
to
garnish
it
eating
in
moderation
i
approve
of
but
mark
my
words
albert
the
man
who
takes
a
meal
on
an
empty
stomach
is
digging
his
grave
with
his
teeth
if
he
would
not
talk
business
i
could
only
hope
his
amiability
would
carry
over
till
i
saw
him
again
in
his
office
tomorrow
i
settled
down
as
far
as
i
could
simply
to
enjoy
his
company
you
may
have
been
surprised
at
my
referring
to
my
life
as
unfortunate
albert
but
it
is
a
judicious
adjective
vilely
unfortunate
i
come
of
a
military
family
you
know
you
will
find
footnotes
mentioning
the
tharios
in
the
history
of
every
war
this
country
has
had
he
finished
what
was
in
his
glass
my
misfortunes
like
tristram
shandy
began
before
my
birth
and
in
the
same
way
exactly
the
same
way
my
father
was
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
who
dreamed
his
life
away
over
the
campaigns
of
the
great
captains
instead
of
attempting
to
become
a
great
captain
himself
i
do
not
condemn
him
for
this
the
organization
of
the
army
is
such
as
to
encourage
impracticality
and
inadvertence
but
the
consequences
were
unfortunate
for
me
he
named
me
after
his
favorite
heroes
stuart
hannibal
ireton
thario
and
so
aloof
was
he
from
the
vulgarities
of
everyday
life
that
it
was
not
until
my
monogram
was
ordered
painted
upon
my
first
piece
of
luggage
that
the
unfortunate
combination
of
my
initials
was
noted
hannibal
and
ireton
promptly
suppressed
in
the
interests
of
decency
nevertheless
at
west
point
my
surname
was
twisted
by
fellow
classmates
into
lothario
giving
it
a
connotation
quite
foreign
to
my
nature
i
lived
down
both
vexations
only
to
encounter
a
third
though
ireton
remained
successfully
concealed
the
hannibal
leaked
out
and
when
during
the
world
war
i
had
the
misfortune
to
lead
a
company
which
was
decimated
his
hand
strayed
to
the
ribbons
on
his
chest
behind
my
back
the
enlistedmen
called
me
cannibal
thario
he
began
discussing
another
drink
of
one
thing
i
resolved
my
son
shall
not
suffer
as
i
have
suffered
i
did
not
send
him
to
west
point
so
he
might
win
decorations
on
the
field
of
valor
and
then
be
shunted
off
to
sit
behind
an
unsoldierly
desk
i
broke
with
tradition
when
i
kept
him
from
a
military
career
quite
on
purpose
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
his
welfare
and
not
some
silly
foible
of
my
own
when
i
called
him
by
the
simplest
name
i
could
find
what
is
your
son
name
i
was
constrained
to
ask
george
he
answered
proudly
george
thario
there
is
no
nickname
for
george
as
far
as
i
know
and
he
not
in
the
army
now
i
queried
more
in
politeness
than
interest
no
and
i
do
intend
he
shall
be
the
general
pink
face
grew
pinker
with
his
vehemence
albert
there
are
plenty
of
dunderheads
and
duffers
like
me
in
the
country
who
are
good
for
nothing
better
than
cannonfodder
let
them
go
and
be
killed
i
willing
enough
only
an
idiotic
general
staff
has
booted
me
into
the
quartermaster
corps
for
which
i
am
no
more
fitted
than
to
run
an
academy
for
lady
marines
but
i
not
willing
for
a
fine
sensitive
boy
a
talented
musician
like
george
to
suffer
the
harsh
brutalities
of
a
trainingcamp
and
battlefield
the
draft
i
began
tentatively
if
george
had
a
civilian
position
in
an
essential
industry
say
one
holding
a
contract
with
the
army
for
badly
needed
fieldrations
i
should
like
to
meet
your
son
i
said
i
have
been
looking
around
for
some
time
for
a
reliable
manager
george
might
consider
it
general
thario
squinted
his
glass
against
the
light
i
have
him
stop
by
your
hotel
tomorrow
the
little
radio
behind
the
bar
which
had
been
mumbling
to
itself
for
hours
spoke
loudly
we
interrupt
this
program
to
bring
you
a
newsflash
eire
has
declared
war
on
the
soviet
union
i
repeat
war
has
been
declared
on
the
union
of
soviet
republics
by
eire
keep
tuned
to
this
station
for
further
details
we
return
you
now
to
our
regular
program
there
was
an
absent
pattering
of
applause
and
general
thario
stood
up
gravely
glass
in
hand
gallant
little
eire
or
if
i
may
be
permitted
once
the
indulgence
of
using
the
good
old
name
we
know
and
love
so
well
brave
old
ireland
when
the
world
was
at
war
despite
every
provocation
she
stayed
peaceful
now
that
the
world
is
disgracefully
pacific
and
you
have
all
heard
foreign
ministers
unanimously
declaring
their
countries
neutral
so
fast
did
they
rush
to
the
microphones
that
they
were
still
panting
when
they
went
on
the
air
when
the
whole
world
was
cautious
ireland
true
to
her
traditions
joined
the
just
cause
gentlemen
i
give
you
our
fighting
ally
eire
departing
from
his
usual
custom
he
drank
the
toast
in
one
gulp
but
no
one
else
in
the
room
paid
any
attention
i
considered
this
lack
of
enthusiasm
for
a
courageous
gesture
quite
unworthy
and
meditated
for
a
moment
on
the
insensitivity
into
which
our
people
seemed
to
have
sunk
as
the
evening
went
on
the
general
grew
more
and
more
affable
and
if
possible
less
and
less
reticent
he
had
he
assured
me
been
the
constant
victim
either
of
men
or
of
circumstances
at
the
military
academy
he
had
trained
for
the
cavalry
only
to
find
himself
assigned
to
the
tank
corps
he
had
reconciled
himself
pursued
his
duties
with
zeal
and
was
shunted
off
to
the
infantry
where
swallowing
chagrin
he
had
led
his
men
bravely
into
a
crossfire
from
machineguns
for
this
he
got
innumerable
decorations
and
a
transfer
to
the
department
his
marriage
to
the
daughter
of
an
influential
politician
should
have
assured
peacetime
promotion
but
the
nuptials
coincided
with
an
election
depriving
the
family
party
of
power
now
another
war
had
come
and
he
was
a
mere
brigadier
pigeonholed
in
an
unimportant
office
with
juniors
broadly
hinting
at
his
retirement
while
classmates
were
leading
divisions
and
even
army
corps
to
glorious
victory
on
the
field
of
battle
at
least
they
would
have
been
leading
them
to
glorious
victory
if
there
had
been
any
action
at
all
invade
insisted
general
thario
becoming
sufficiently
stirred
by
his
fervor
to
lapse
into
sober
incoherence
invade
them
before
they
invade

abc
no
doubt
it
was
a
pity
he
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
try
these
tactics
i
was
one
of
the
few
who
had
not
become
a
military
theoretician
upon
the
outbreak
of
the
war
but
to
my
lay
mind
his
plan
sounded
feasible
nevertheless
i
was
more
interested
in
the
possible
contract
for
food
concentrates
than
in
any
strategy
no
matter
how
brilliant
afraid
i
showed
my
boredom
for
the
general
abruptly
declared
it
was
time
to
go
home
i
was
a
little
dubious
that
after
all
the
drinking
and
confidences
he
would
remember
to
send
his
son
around
and
to
tell
the
truth
in
the
calm
morning
i
felt
i
would
not
be
too
sorry
if
he
didnt
for
he
had
not
given
me
a
very
high
opinion
of
that
young
man
what
on
earth
consolidated
pemmican
could
do
with
a
musician
and
a
draftevader
as
generalmanager
even
if
the
title
as
it
must
be
were
purely
honorary
i
couldnt
imagine
i
had
been
long
up
shaved
and
breakfasted
and
had
attended
to
my
correspondence
before
the
telephone
rang
and
george
thario
announced
himself
at
my
disposal
he
was
what
people
call
a
handsome
young
man
that
is
he
was
big
and
burly
and
slow
and
his
eyelashes
were
perceptible
his
hair
was
short
and
he
wore
no
hat
but
lounged
about
the
room
with
his
hands
thumbs
out
in
his
jacketpockets
looking
at
me
vaguely
through
the
curling
smoke
from
a
bent
pipe
i
had
never
seen
anyone
look
less
like
a
musician
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
his
father
had
been
serious
in
so
describing
him
i
do
like
it
he
announced
abruptly
do
like
what
mr
thario
i
inquired
joe
to
you
he
corrected
mister
from
you
to
me
belies
our
prospective
relationship
just
call
me
joe
i
thought
your
name
was
george
baptismal
whim
of
the
old
man
but
it
a
stuffy
label
no
shortening
it
you
know
so
the
fellows
all
call
me
joe
chummier
like
the
idea
of
evading
the
draft
shows
a
lack
of
moral
courage
by
rights
i
ought
to
be
a
conchie
but
that
would
just
about
kill
the
old
lady
she
in
a
firstclass
uproar
as
it
is
like
to
see
me
in
the
frontlines
right
now
bursting
with
dulce
et
decorum
i
do
believe
it
would
bother
the
old
man
any
if
i
sat
out
the
duration
in
a
c
o
camp
but
it
hurt
his
job
like
hell
and
the
poor
old
boy
is
straining
his
guts
to
get
into
the
trenches
and
twirl
a
theoretical
saber
so
i
guess
i
slated
to
be
your
humble
and
obedient
mr
weener
i
be
delighted
to
have
you
join
our
firm
i
said
wryly
for
i
felt
he
would
be
a
completely
useless
appendage
in
this
i
am
glad
to
say
i
did
him
an
injustice
for
though
he
never
denied
his
essential
lack
of
interest
in
concentrates
and
the
whole
process
of
moneymaking
he
proved
nevertheless
at
such
times
as
he
chose
to
attend
to
his
duties
a
faithful
and
conscientious
employee
his
only
faults
being
lack
of
initiative
and
a
tendency
to
pamper
the
workers
in
the
plant
but
i
have
anticipated
at
the
moment
i
looked
upon
him
only
as
a
liability
to
be
balanced
in
good
time
by
the
asset
of
his
position
it
was
therefore
with
irritation
i
listened
to
his
insistence
on
my
coming
to
the
thario
home
that
afternoon
to
meet
his
mother
and
sisters
i
had
no
desire
for
purely
social
intercourse
last
outing
being
in
the
nature
of
a
business
investment
and
it
seemed
superfluous
to
be
forced
to
extend
courtesies
to
an
entire
family
because
of
involvement
with
one
member
however
great
my
reluctance
i
felt
i
couldnt
afford
to
risk
giving
offense
and
so
at
fouroclock
promptly
i
was
in
georgetown
using
the
knocker
of
a
door
looking
like
all
the
other
doors
on
both
sides
of
the
street
i
winifred
thario
and
youre
the
chewinggum
man
no
wait
a
minute
i
get
it
the
food
concentrate
man
who
going
to
make
joe
essential
to
the
war
effort
do
come
in
and
excuse
my
rudeness
i
the
youngest
you
know
except
for
joe
so
everybody
excuses
me
her
straight
blond
hair
looked
dead
the
vivacity
which
lit
her
windburned
face
seemed
a
false
vivacity
and
when
she
showed
her
large
white
teeth
i
thought
it
was
with
a
calculated
effort
she
led
me
into
a
livingroom
peopled
like
an
earlyvictorian
conversationpiece
behind
a
low
table
in
a
rockingchair
sat
a
large
fullbosomed
woman
with
the
same
dead
hair
and
weatherbeaten
cheeks
the
only
difference
being
that
the
blondness
of
her
hair
was
mitigated
by
gray
and
in
her
face
were
the
tiny
broken
red
lines
which
no
doubt
in
time
would
come
to
winifred
this
is
mama
said
winifred
accenting
the
second
syllable
strongly
and
contriving
at
once
to
be
vivacious
and
reverent
mama
inclined
her
head
toward
me
without
the
faintest
smile
welcoming
or
otherwise
placing
her
hand
as
she
did
so
regally
upon
the
teacozy
as
upon
a
royal
orb
mrs
thario
i
said
i
am
delighted
to
meet
you
mama
found
this
beneath
her
condescension
and
this
is
constance
the
general
firstborn
introduced
winifred
still
retaining
her
liveliness
despite
mama
low
temperature
constance
was
the
perfect
connectinglink
between
winifred
and
her
mother
not
yet
gray
but
soon
to
be
so
without
winifred
animation
but
with
the
same
voluntary
smile
showing
the
same
white
teeth
she
rose
and
shook
my
hand
as
she
might
have
shaken
a
naughty
puppy
with
a
vigorous
sidewise
jerk
disengaging
the
clasp
quickly
and
this
announced
winifred
brightly
is
pauline
to
say
that
pauline
thario
was
beautiful
would
be
like
saying
mount
everest
is
high
in
her
the
blond
hair
sparkled
like
newly
threshed
straw
the
teeth
were
just
as
white
and
even
but
they
did
not
seem
too
large
for
her
mouth
and
her
complexion
was
faultless
as
a
cosmetic
ad
she
was
an
unbelievably
exquisite
painting
placed
in
an
appropriate
frame
and
yet
and
yet
the
painting
had
a
quality
of
unreality
about
it
as
though
it
were
the
delineation
of
a
madonna
without
child
or
of
a
nun
there
was
no
vigor
to
her
beauty
no
touch
of
the
earthiness
or
of
blemish
necessary
to
make
the
loveliness
real
and
bring
it
home
she
did
not
offer
me
her
hand
but
bowed
in
a
manner
only
slightly
less
distant
than
her
mother
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
petitpoint
chair
thoroughly
illatease
you
must
tell
us
about
your
pills
mr
weener
urged
winifred
pills
i
asked
at
a
loss
yes
the
thingamyjigs
youre
going
to
have
joe
make
for
you
explained
constance
mama
made
a
loud
trumpeting
noise
which
so
startled
me
i
half
rose
from
my
seat
damned
slacker
she
exclaimed
looking
fiercely
right
over
my
head
now
mama
bloodpressure
enjoined
pauline
in
a
colorless
voice
mama
relapsed
into
immobility
and
winifred
went
on
quite
as
if
there
had
been
no
explosion
are
you
married
mr
weener
i
said
i
was
not
then
here
our
chance
for
pauline
decided
winifred
mr
weener
how
would
you
like
to
marry
pauline
i
could
do
nothing
but
smile
uncomfortably
was
this
the
sort
of
conversation
habitually
carried
on
in
their
circle
or
were
they
quite
mad
constance
mentioned
with
apparent
irrelevance
winifred
is
so
giddy
and
pauline
smiled
at
me
understandingly
but
winifred
went
on
weve
been
trying
to
marry
pauline
off
for
years
you
know
she
wonderful
to
look
at
but
she
hasnt
any
sexappeal
mama
snorted
damned
vulgar
thing
to
have
would
you
like
some
tea
mr
weener
asked
constance
tea
he
looks
like
a
secret
cocacola
guzzler
to
me
are
you
an
american
mr
uh
mama
demanded
fiercely
deigning
for
the
first
time
to
address
me
i
was
born
in
california
mrs
thario
i
assured
her
pity
pity
damned
shame
she
muttered
i
was
partially
relieved
from
my
uneasiness
by
the
appearance
of
george
thario
who
bounded
in
waved
lightly
at
his
sisters
and
kissed
his
mother
just
below
her
hairline
my
respectful
duty
mama
he
greeted
damned
hypocrisy
you
did
your
duty
youd
be
in
the
army
bloodpressure
warned
constance
have
they
made
you
thoroughly
miserable
mr
weener
do
mind
them
there
something
wrong
with
all
the
tharios
except
the
old
man
blood
gone
thin
from
too
much
intermarriage
just
like
incest
exclaimed
winifred
do
you
think
fascinating
mr
weener
eugene
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
morbid
objected
constance
damned
nonsense
grunted
mama
cream
or
lemon
mr
weener
inquired
constance
mama
moved
by
a
hospitable
reflex
filled
a
grudging
cup
cream
please
i
requested
turn
it
sour
muttered
mama
but
she
poured
the
cream
and
handed
the
cup
to
constance
who
passed

you
just
mustnt
forget
to
keep
pauline
in
mind
mr

she
would
be
a
terrific
help
when
you
become
horribly
rich
and
have
to
do
a

of
stuffy
entertaining
really
winifred
protested
constance
help
him
to
the
poorhouse
and
a
damned
good
riddance
i
spent
another
uneasy
fifteen
minutes
before
i
could
decently
make
my
departure
wondering
whether
i
hadnt
made
a
mistake
in
becoming
involved
with
the
tharios
at
all
but
there
being
no
question
of
the
solidity
of
the
general
position
i
decided
since
it
was
not
afterall
incumbent
upon
me
to
continue
a
social
connection
with
them
to
bear
with
it
and
confine
my
acquaintance
as
far
as
possible
to
joe
and
his
father
as
soon
as
the
contracts
were
awarded
the
struggle
began
to
obtain
necessary
labor
and
raw
materials
we
were
straining
everything
to
do
a
patriotic
service
to
the
country
in
time
of
war
but
we
came
up
against
the
competition
for
these
essentials
by
ruthless
capitalists
who
had
no
thought
but
to
milk
the
government
by
selling
them
supplies
at
an
enormous
profit
even
with
the
wholehearted
assistance
of
general
thario
it
was
an
endless
and
painful
task
to
comply
with
break
through
or
evade
the
restrictions
and
regulations
thrown
up
by
an
uncertain
and
slowmoving
administration
restrictions
designed
to
aid
our
competitors
and
hamper
us
yet
we
got
organized
at
last
and
by
the
time
three
russian
marshals
had
been
purged
and
the
american
highcommand
had
been
shaken
up
several
times
we
had
doubled
the
capacity
of
our
plant
and
were
negotiating
the
purchase
of
a
new
factory
in
florida
i
set
aside
a
block
of
stock
for
the
general
but
its
transfer
was
a
delicate
matter
on
account
of
the
indefatigable
nosiness
of
the
government
and
i
approached
his
son
for
advice
alberich
exclaimed
joe
incomprehensibly
just
wrap
it
up
and
mail
it
to
him
mama
god
bless
her
takes
care
of
all
financial
transactions
anyway
and
doubtless
with
great
force
i
thought
such
directness
i
pointed
out
might
have
embarrassing
repercussions
because
of
inevitably
smallminded
interpretation
if
the
facts
ever
became
public
we
finally
solved
the
problem
by
putting
the
gift
in
george
thario
name
he
making
a
will
leaving
it
to
the
general
i
informed
his
father
in
a
guarded
letter
of
what
we
had
done
and
he
replied
at
great
length
and
somewhat
indiscreetly
as
the
following
quotation
may
show
in
spite
of
pulling
every
handy
and
unhandy
wire
i
am
still
billeted
on
this
ridiculous
desk
the
general
staff
is
the
most
incompetent
set
of
blunderers
ever
to
wear
military
uniform
since
bull
run
they
never
heard
of
foch
much
less
of
falkenhayn
and
mackensen
to
say
nothing
of
rommel
guderian
or
montgomery
they
rest
idly
behind
their
washington
breastworks
when
the
order
of
the
day
should
be
attack
attack
and
again
attack
keeping
the
combat
entirely
verbal
weakening
the
spirit
of
our
forces
and
waiting
supinely
for
the
enemy
to
bring
the
war
to
us
although
i
was
too
much
occupied
with
the
press
of
business
to
follow
the
daytoday
progress
of
hostilities
there
was
little
doubt
the
general
was
justified
in
his
strictures
the
war
was
entirely
static
with
fear
of
raids
by
marauding
aircraft
allayed
the
only
remaining
uneasiness
of
the
public
had
been
whether
the
words
heavier
than
air
craft
covered
robot
or
v
bombs
but
when
weeks
had
passed
without
these
dreadful
missiles
whistling
downward
this
anxiety
also
went
and
the
country
settled
down
to
enjoy
a
wartime
prosperity
as
pleasant
notwithstanding
the
fiftyhour
week
rationing
and
the
exorbitant
incometax
as
the
peacetime
panic
had
been
miserable
in
my
own
case
consolidated
pemmican
was
quoted
at
and
i
was
on
my
way
in
spite
of
all
hampering
circumstances
to
reap
the
benefits
of
foresight
and
industry
unique
among
great
combats
not
a
shot
had
so
far
been
exchanged
and
everyone
except
cranks
began
to
look
upon
the
academic
conflict
as
an
unalloyed
benefit
gradually
the
war
began
leaving
the
frontpages
military
analysts
found
themselves
next
to
either
the
chessproblems
today
selected
recipe
or
the
weekly
horoscope
people
once
more
began
to
concern
themselves
with
the
grass
it
now
extended
in
a
vast
sweep
from
a
point
on
the
mexican
coast
below
the
town
of
mazatlan
northward
along
the
slope
of
the
rocky
mountains
up
into
canada
yukon
province
it
was
wildest
at
its
point
of
origin
covering
southern
california
and
nevada
arizona
and
part
of
new
mexico
and
it
was
narrowest
in
the
north
where
it
dabbled
with
delicate
fingers
at
the
mouth
of
the
mackenzie
river
it
had
spared
practically
all
of
alaska
nearly
all
of
british
columbia
most
of
washington
western
oregon
and
the
seacoast
of
northern
california
why
it
surged
up
to
the
rockies
and
not
over
them
when
it
had
conquered
individually
higher
mountains
was
not
understood
but
people
were
quick
once
more
to
take
hope
and
remember
the
plant
normal
distaste
for
cold
or
think
there
was
perhaps
something
in
the
rarefied
atmosphere
to
paralyze
the
seeds
or
inhibit
the
stolons
so
preventing
further
progress
even
through
the
comparatively
low
passes
it
came
at
such
a
slow
pace
methods
tried
fruitlessly
in
los
angeles
were
successful
in
keeping
it
back
everyone
was
quite
ready
to
wipe
off
the
far
west
if
the
grass
were
going
to
spare
the
rest
of
the
country
general
thario
indiscreet
letters
kept
coming
if
anything
they
increased
in
frequency
indiscretion
and
length
as
his
continued
frustration
in
securing
a
field
command
was
added
to
his
helpless
wrath
at
the
generalstaff
ineptitude
they
have
got
hold
of
that
odd
female
scientist
francis
he
wrote
and
have
made
her
turn
over
her
formula
for
making
grass
go
crazy
it
to
be
used
as
a
war
weapon
but
how
or
where
i
do
know
just
the
sort
of
silly
rot
a
lot
of
armchair
theorists
would
dream
up
later
he
wrote
indignantly
they
are
sending
a
group
of
picked
men
to
russia
to
inoculate
the
grasses
on
the
steppes
with
this
francis
stuff
sheer
waste
of
trained
men
bungling
incompetence
why
not
send
a
specially
selected
group
of
hypnotists
to
persuade
the
russians
to
sue
for
peace
it
would
be
better
to
have
given
them
mills
bombs
and
let
them
blow
up
the
kremlin
time
and
effort
and
good
men
thrown
away
still
later
he
wrote
with
unconcealed
satisfaction
well
that
silly
business
of
inoculating
the
steppes
came
to
exactly
nothing
our
fellows
got
through
of
course
and
did
their
job
but
nothing
happened
to
the
grass
either
francis
gave
them
the
wrong
formula
possibly
mislaid
the
right
one
in
her
handbag
or
else
what
worked
in
california
do
elsewhere
she
is
busy
trying
to
explain
herself
to
a
military
commission
right
now
for
my
part
they
can
either
shoot
her
or
put
her
in
charge
of
the
wac
it
of
no
moment
you
ca
fight
a
determined
enemy
with
sprayguns
and
formulas
attack
with
infantry
by
way
of
siberia
while
everyone
except
possibly
general
thario
and
others
in
similar
position
was
enjoying
the
new
comradeinarms
atmosphere
the
abortive
war
had
brought
on
a
sudden
series
of
submarine
attacks
on
the
pacific
fleet
provided
a
disagreeable
jolt
and
ended
the
bloodless
stage
of
the
conflict
tried
and
proved
methods
of
detection
and
defense
became
useless
the
warships
were
nothing
more
than
targets
for
the
enemy
torpedoes
in
quick
succession
the
battleships
and
were
sunk
as
were
the
carriers
and
as
well
as
the
cruisers
and
to
say
nothing
of
the
countless
destroyers
and
other
craft
never
had
the
navy
been
so
crippled
and
the
people
presaging
correctly
a
forthcoming
invasion
suffered
a
new
series
of
terrors
which
was
only
relieved
by
the
news
of
the
russian
landings
on
the
california
coast
at
cambria
san
simeon
and
big
sur
what
did
i
tell
you
what
did
i
tell
them
the
duffers
and
dunderheads
we
could
have
been
halfway
across
asia
by
now
instead
we
waited
and
hemmed
and
hawed
till
the
enemy
from
the
sheer
weight
of
our
inertia
was
forced
to
attack
the
whole
crew
should
be
courtmartialed
and
made
to
study
the
campaigns
of
generals
shafter
and
wheeler
as
punishment
general
thario
always
precise
handwriting
wavered
and
trembled
with
the
violence
of
his
disgust
an
impalpable
war
pregnant
with
annihilating
scientific
devices
and
other
unseen
bogies
was
one
thing
actual
invasion
of
the
sacred
soil
over
which
old
glory
flew
and
by
presumptuous
foreigners
who
couldnt
even
speak
english
was
quite
another
at
once
the
will
of
the
nation
stiffened
and
for
the
first
time
something
approaching
enthusiasm
was
manifest
cartoonists
moved
by
a
common
impulse
unanimously
drew
pictures
of
uncle
sam
rolling
up
his
sleeves
and
preparing
to
give
the
pesky
interlopers
a
good
trouncing
before
hurling
them
back
into
the
pacific
unfortunately
the
presence
of
the
grass
prevented
quick
eviction
of
the
unwelcome
visitors
only
a
small
portion
of
the
armed
forces
was
based
on
the
pacific
coast
because
of
the
logistical
problems
presented
by
inadequacies
of
supply
and
transportation
of
these
only
a
fraction
could
be
sent
to
the
threatened
places
for
fear
dispersions
of
the
main
body
would
prove
disastrous
if
the
landings
were
feints
thus
the
enemy
came
ashore
practically
unopposed
at
his
original
landingpoints
and
secured
small
additional
beachheads
at
gorda
lucia
morro
bay
and
carmel
east
of
the
grass
there
were
whole
armies
who
had
completed
basic
training
fit
and
supple
the
obvious
answer
to
the
invasion
was
to
load
them
on
transports
and
ship
them
to
the
theater
of
operations
unfortunately
the
agreement
not
to
use
heavierthanaircraft
was
an
insuperable
bar
to
this
action
that
the
pact
had
never
been
designed
to
prevent
nations
from
defending
their
soil
against
an
invader
was
certain
thousands
of
voices
urged
that
we
keep
the
spirit
of
the
treaty
and
disregard
the
letter
no
one
could
expect
us
to
sit
idly
by
and
let
our
homeland
be
invaded
because
of
overfinicky
interpretation
of
a
diplomatic
document
but
in
spite
of
this
clear
logic
the
american
people
were
swept
by
a
wave
of
timidity
if
we
use
airplanes
they
argued
so
will
the
russians
airplanes
mean
bombs
bombs
mean
atombombs
better
to
let
the
russians
hold
what
advantage
their
invasion
has
given
them
than
to
have
our
cities
destroyed
our
population
wiped
out
our
descendants
if
any
born
with
six
heads
or
a
dozen
arms
as
a
result
of
radioactivity
according
to
general
thario
for
a
while
it
was
touchandgo
whether
the
president
would
yield
to
the
men
of
vision
or
the
others
but
in
the
end
apprehension
and
calculation
ordained
that
every
effort
must
be
made
to
reinforce
the
defense
of
the
west
coast
except
the
effective
one
of
course
every
dirigible
was
commandeered
and
work
speeded
up
on
those
under
construction
troopships
heedless
of
their
vulnerability
rushed
for
the
panama
canal
while
negotiations
were
opened
with
mexico
looking
toward
transporting
divisions
over
its
territory
to
a
point
south
of
the
weed
while
confusion
and
defeatism
took
as
heavy
a
toll
of
the
spirit
as
an
actual
defeat
on
the
battlefield
the
russians
slowly
pushed
their
way
inland
and
consolidated
their
positions
the
american
units
offered
valiant
resistance
but
little
by
little
they
were
driven
northward
until
a
fairly
fixed
front
was
established
south
of
san
francisco
from
the
ocean
to
the
bay
and
a
more
fluid
one
from
the

to
the
edge
of

at

a

finest
of

where

but
it
is
not
far
from
a

for
its

in
a
mining
state
brigade
is
remarkably
fit
considering
and
the
men
are
rearing
to
go
keep
your
ear
open
for
some
news
it
wo
be
long
the
news
was
of
the
heroic
counterlandings
the
entire
fleet
disdainful
of
possible
submarine
action
stood
off
from
the
rear
of
the
russian
positions
bombarding
them
for
fortyeight
hours
preliminary
to
landing
marines
who
fought
their
way
inland
to
recapture
nearly
half
the
invaded
territory
simultaneously
the
army
below
san
francisco
pushed
the
russians
back
and
made
contact
at
some
points
with
the
marines
the
enemy
was
reduced
to
a
mere
foothold
but
the
whole
operation
proved
no
more
than
a
rearguard
action
as
general
thario
wrote
we
are
fighting
on
the
wrong
continent
joe
was
even
broader
and
more
emphatic
it
a
putup
job
he
complained

we
have
some
kind
of

off
i
had
suspected
him
of
being
some
kind
of
parlor
radical
and
although
he
would
doubtless
outgrow
his
youthful
notions
it
made
me
uneasy
to
have
a
crank
in
my
employ
but
beyond
urging
him
to
keep
his

strictly
to
himself

the
general

hadnt
altered
the

of
our

and
we
had
too
many
unscrupulous
competitors
to
rely
solely
upon
merit
for
the
continuance
of
our
sales
george
thario
attitude
was
symptomatic
of
the
demoralization
of
the
country
apparent
even
during
our
momentary
success
there
was
no
will
to
victory
and
the
generalstaff
if
one
could
believe
general
thario
was
too
unimaginative
and
inflexible
to
meet
the
peculiar
conditions
of
a
war
circumscribed
and
shaped
by
the
alien
glacier
dividing
the
country
and
diverting
normal
operations
into
novel
channels
so
the
new
landings
at
astoria
and
longview
though
anticipated
and
indeed
precisely
indicated
by
the
flimsiness
of
the
russian
resistance
to
the
counteroffensive
caught
the
highcommand
by
surprise
never
was
a
military
operation
more
certain
wrote
general
thario
and
never
was
less
done
to
meet
the
certainty
albert
if
a
businessman
conducted
himself
like
the
military
college
he
would
be
bankrupt
in
six
months
wherever
the
fault
lay
the
american
gains
were
wiped
out
and
the
invaders
swept
ahead
to
occupy
all
of
the
country
west
of
the
grass
boastfully
they
sent
us
newsreels
of
their
entries
into
portland
and
seattle
they
established
headquarters
in
san
francisco
and
paraded
forty
abreast
down
market
street
renamed
krassny
prospekt
the
russians
also
renamed
montgomery
street
and
van
ness
after
mooney
and
billings
respectively
but
for
some
reason
abandoned
these
designations
almost
immediately
but
for
all
their
celebrations
and
gun
salutes
this
was
as
far
as
they
could
go
the
monstrous
growth
which
had
clogged
our
defense
now
sealed
the
invaders
off
and
held
them
in
an
evershrinking
sector
now
came
another
period
of
quiescence
in
the
war
but
a
period
radically
different
in
temper
from
the
first
there
were
many
perhaps
constituting
a
majority
who
like
george
thario
wanted
a
peace
almost
any
kind
of
peace
to
be
made
others
attempted
to
ignore
the
presence
of
a
war
entirely
and
to
conduct
their
lives
as
though
it
did
not
exist
still
others
seemed
to
regard
it
as
some
kind
of
game
a
contest
carried
on
in
a
bloodless
vacuum
and
from
these
to
the
newspapers
and
the
wardepartment
came
the
hundreds
of
plans
nearly
all
of
them
entirely
fantastic
for
conquering
an
enemy
now
unassailably
entrenched
but
while
pessimism
and
lassitude
governed
the
united
states
the
intruders
were
taking
energetic
measures
to
increase
their
successes
i
have
been
present
at
the
questioning
of
two
spies
reported
general
thario
and
i
want
to
tell
you
the
enemy
is
not
going
to
miss
a
single
opportunity
unlike
ourselves
what
they
have
in
mind
i
can
not
guess
they
ca
fly
over
the
grass
any
more
than
we
can
as
long
as
they
want
to
conciliate
world
opinion
and
i
doubt
if
they
can
tunnel
under
it
but
that
they
intend
to
do
is
beyond
question
often
the
obvious
course
is
the
surprising
one
since
the
russians
couldnt
go
over
or
under
the
grass
they
decided
to
march
on
top
of
it
they
had
heard
of
our
prewar
snowshoe
excursions
on
its
surface
and
so
they
equipped
a
vast
army
with
this
clumsy
footgear
and
set
it
in
motion
with
supplytrains
on
wide
skis
pulled
by
the
men
themselves
russian
ingenuity
boasted
the
kremlin
would
succeed
in
conquering
the
grass
where
the
decadent
imperialists
had
failed
it
is
unbelievable
you
might
even
call
it
absurd
but
at
least
they
are
doing
something
not
sitting
twiddling
their
thumbs
my
men
would
give
six
months
pay
to
be
as
active
as
the
enemy
to
be
sure
they
are
grotesque
and
inefficient
so
was
the
army
of
italy
imagine
sending
an
army
or
armies
if
our
reports
are
correct
on
a
six
hundred
mile
march
without
an
airforce
without
artillery
without
any
mechanized
equipment
whatsoever
unless
like
the
army
of
italy
they
have
a
bonaparte
concealed
behind
their
lunacy
they
have
no
chance
at
all
of
success
but
by
the
military
genius
of
joseph
eggleston
johnston
if
i
were
a
younger
man
and
not
an
american
i
would
like
to
be
with
them
just
for
the
fun
they
are
having
by
its
very
nature
the
expedition
was
composed
exclusively
of
infantry
divisions
carrying
the
latest
type
of
automatic
rifle
the
field
commissaries
the
ambulances
the
baggagetrains
had
to
be
cut
to
the
barest
minimum
and
general
thario
wrote
that
evidently
because
of
the
impossibility
of
taking
along
artillery
the
enemy
had
also
abandoned
their
light
and
heavy
machineguns
against
this
determined
threat
behind
the
wall
of
the
rockies
the
american
army
waited
with
field
artillery
railway
guns
bazookas
and
flamethrowers
for
the
first
time
there
was
belief
in
a
russian
defeat
if
not
in
eventual
american
victory
but
the
waiting
americans
were
not
to
be
given
the
opportunity
for
handtohand
combat
since
planes
could
not
report
the
progress
of
the
snowshoers
over
the
grass
dirigibles
and
free
balloons
drifting
with
the
wind
gave
minutetominute
reports
though
many
of
the
airships
were
shot
down
and
many
more
of
the
balloons
blown
helplessly
out
of
the
area
enough
returned
to
give
a
picture
of
the
rapid
disintegration
of
the
invading
force
nothing
like
it
had
happened
to
an
army
since
the
snowshoes
adequate
enough
for
short
excursions
over
the
edge
of
the
grass
became
suicidal
instruments
on
a
march
of
weeks
starting
eastward
from
their
bases
in
northern
california
oregon
and
washington
in
military
formation
singing
triumphantly
in
minor
keys
the
slavic
steamroller
had
presented
an
imposing
sight
americans
in
the
occupied
area
seeing
column
after
column
of
closely
packed
soldiers
tramping
endlessly
up
and
over
the
grass
said
it
reminded
them
of
old
prints
of
pickett
charge
at
gettysburg
the
first
day
march
went
well
enough
though
it
covered
no
more
than
a
few
miles
at
night
they
camped
upon
great
squares
of
tarpaulin
and
in
the
morning
resumed
their
webfooted
way
but
the
night
had
not
proved
restful
for
over
the
edges
of
every
tarpaulin
the
eager
grass
had
thrust
impatient
runners
and
when
the
time
came
to
decamp
more
than
half
the
canvases
had
been
left
in
possession
of
the
weed
the
second
progress
was
slower
than
the
first
and
it
was
clear
to
the
observers
the
men
were
tiring
unduly
more
than
one
threw
away
his
rifle
to
make
the
marching
easier
some
freed
themselves
of
their
snowshoes
and
so
after
a
few
yards
sank
inextricably
tangled
into
the
grass
others
lay
down
exhausted
to
rise
no
more
the
men
in
the
balloons
could
see
by
the
way
the
feet
were
raised
that
the
inquisitive
stolons
were
more
and
more
entangling
themselves
in
the
webbing
still
the
soviet
command
poured
fresh
troops
onto
the
grass
profiting
perhaps
by
the
american
example
they
transported
new
supplies
to
the
army
by
dirigibles
replacing
the
lost
tarpaulins
and
rifles
daringly
sending
whole
divisions
of
snowshoers
by
parachute
almost
to
the
eastern
edge
this
last
experiment
proved
too
reckless
for
enough
of
these
adventurers
were
located
to
permit
their
annihilation
by
longrange
artillery
their
endurance
is
incredible
magnificent
eulogized
general
thario
enthusiastically
they
are
contending
not
only
with
the
prospect
of
meeting
fresh
unworn
troops
on
our
side
but
against
a
tireless
enemy
who
can
not
be
awed
or
hurt
and
even
more
against
their
own
feelings
of
fear
and
despair
which
must
come
upon
them
constantly
as
they
get
farther
into
this
green
desert
farther
from
natural
surroundings
deeper
into
the
silence
and
mystery
of
the
abnormal
barrier
they
have
undertaken
to
cross
they
are
supermen
and
only
supernatural
means
will
defeat
them
but
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
that
the
general
credited
the
foe
with
a
stronger
spirit
than
they
possessed
their
spirit
was
undoubtedly
high
but
it
could
not
stand
up
against
the
relentless
harassment
of
the
grass
the
weary
sodden
advance
went
on
slower
and
slower
the
toll
higher
and
higher
there
were
signs
of
dissatisfaction
mutiny
and
madness
some
units
turned
about
to
be
shot
down
by
those
behind
some
wandered
off
helplessly
until
lost
forever
the
dwindling
of
the
great
army
accelerated
airborne
replacements
dependent
on
such
erratic
transport
failed
to
fill
the
gaps
the
marchers
no
longer
fired
at
the
airships
overhead
they
moved
their
feet
slowly
hopelessly
stood
stockstill
for
hours
or
faltered
aimlessly
occasional
improvised
white
flags
could
be
seen
held
apathetically
up
toward
the
balloonists
long
after
their
brave
start
the
crazed
and
starving
survivors
began
trickling
into
the
american
lines
where
they
surrendered
they
were
dull
and
listless
except
for
one
strange
manifestation
they
shied
away
fearfully
from
every
living
plant
or
growth
but
did
they
see
a
bare
patch
of
soil
a
boulder
or
stretch
of
sand
they
clutched
kissed
mumbled
and
wept
over
it
in
a
very
frenzy
but
the
catastrophic
loss
of
their
great
armies
was
not
all
the
enemy
had
to
endure
as
the
grass
had
stood
our
ally
and
swallowed
the
attackers
helping
us
in
a
negative
fashion
as
it
were
it
now
turned
and
became
a
positive
force
in
our
relief
unnoticed
for
months
it
had
crept
northwestward
filching
precious
mile
after
mile
of
the
hostile
foothold
now
it
spurted
ahead
as
it
had
sometimes
done
before
at
a
furious
pace
to
take
over
the
coast
as
far
north
as
the
russian
river
which
now
doubled
the
irony
of
its
name
and
added
thousands
of
square
miles
to
its
area
at
the
enemy
expense
it
surged
directly
westward
too
making
what
was
left
of
the
invader
foothold
precarious
in
the
extreme
the
stockmarket
boomed
and
the
country
went
wild
with
joy
at
the
news
of
the
soviet
defeats
at
the
darkest
moment
we
had
been
delivered
by
forces
outside
ourselves
but
still
indubitably
american
hymns
of
praise
were
sung
to
the
grass
as
the
savior
of
the
nation
and
in
a
burst
of
gratitude
it
was
declared
a
national
park
forever
inviolate
rationing
restrictions
were
eased
and
many
industries
were
sensibly
returned
to
private
ownership
good
old
uncle
sam
was
unbeatable
afterall
but
if
the
americans
were
jubilant
the
russians
were
cast
into
deepest
gloom
accustomed
to
tremendous
wartime
losses
of
manpower
they
had
at
first
taken
the
news
stoically
interpreting
it
as
just
another
defeat
to
be
later
redeemed
by
pouring
fresh
troops
and
then
more
fresh
troops
after
those
which
had
gone
down
but
when
they
realized
they
had
lost
not
divisions
but
whole
armies
that
they
had
suffered
a
greater
blow
than
any
in
their
history
that
their
reserve
power
was
little
greater
than
the
armies
remaining
to
the
americans
and
finally
that
the
grass
the
foe
which
had
dealt
all
these
grievous
blows
was
rapidly
wiping
out
what
remained
of
their
bridgehead
they
began
to
murmur
against
the
war
itself
under
our
dear
little
uncle
stalin
they
said
this
would
never
have
taken
place
our
sons
and
brothers
would
not
have
been
sent
to
die
so
far
away
from
holy
mother
russia
down
with
the
enemies
of
stalin
down
with
the
warmongering
bureaucracy
the
kremlin
hastened
to
assure
the
population
it
was
carrying
out
the
wishes
of
the
sainted
stalin
it
convinced
them
of
the
purity
of
its
motives
by
machinegunning
all
demonstrators
and
executing
after
public
trials
all
saboteurs
and
traitors
for
some
reason
these
arguments
failed
to
win
over
the
people
and
on
november
a
new
slogan
was
heard
long
live
stalin
and
trotsky
which
proved
so
popular
that
in
a
short
time
the
entire
bureaucracy
was
liquidated
the
soviet
union
declared
an
unequivocal
workers
state
the
army
replaced
by
redguards
the
selling
of
soviet
bonds
decreed
a
contravention
of
socialist
economy
wages
of
all
were
equalized
and
the
word
stakhanovism
erased
from
all
russian
dictionaries
no
formal
peace
was
ever
made
neither
side
had
any
further
appetite
for
war
and
though
newspapers
like
the
continued
for
months
to
clamor
for
the
resumption
of
hostilities
even
to
using
aircraft
now
that
there
was
less
danger
of
reprisal
both
countries
seemed
content
to
return
quietly
to
the
status
quo
the
only
results
of
the
war
aside
from
the
tremendous
losses
was
that
in
america
the
grass
had
been
unmolested
for
a
year
and
the
soviet
union
had
a
new
constitution
one
of
the
peculiar
provisions
of
this
constitution
was
that
political
offenders
and
the
definition
was
now
severely
limited
leaving
out
ninetynine
percent
of
those
formerly
jeoparded
should
henceforth
expiate
their
crimes
by
spending
the
term
of
their
sentence
gazing
at
the
colossal
and
elaborate
tomb
of
stalin
which
occupied
the
center
of
red
square
general
stuart
thario
rudely
treated
by
an
ungrateful
republic
had
the
choice
of
a
permanent
colonelcy
or
retirement
i
have
always
thought
it
was
his
human
vanity
making
him
cling
to
the
title
of
general
which
caused
him
to
retire
at
any
rate
there
was
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
place
for
him
in
our
organization
and
if
his
son
salary
and
position
were
reduced
in
consequence
it
was
all
in
the
family
as
the
saying
goes
one
of
the
happy
results
of
our
unique
system
of
free
enterprise
was
the
rewarding
of
men
in
exact
proportion
to
their
merits
and
abilities
the
war
bringing
disruption
and
bankruptcy
to
so
many
shiftless
and
shortsighted
people
made
of
consolidated
pemmican
one
of
the
great
concerns
the
organization
welcoming
general
thario
was
far
different
from
the
one
which
had
hired
his
son
i
now
had
fourteen
factories
stretching
like
a
string
of
lustrous
pearls
from
quebec
down
to
montevideo
and
i
was
negotiating
to
open
new
branches
in
europe
and
the
far
east
i
had
been
elected
to
the
directorship
of
several
important
corporations
and
my
material
possessions
were
enough
to
constitute
a
nuisance
for
i
have
always
remained
a
simple
literary
sort
of
fellow
at
heart
requiring
secretaries
and
stewards
to
look
after
them
it
is
a
depressing
sidelight
on
human
nature
that
the
achievement
of
eminence
brings
with
it
the
malice
and
spite
of
petty
minds
and
no
one
of
prominence
can
avoid
becoming
the
target
of
stupid
and
unscrupulous
attack
it
would
be
pointless
now
to
go
into
those
carping
and
unjust
accusations
directed
at
me
by
irresponsible
newspaper
columnists
another
man
might
have
ignored
these
mean
assaults
but
i
am
naturally
sensitive
and
while
it
was
beneath
my
dignity
to
reply
personally
i
thought
it
perhaps
one
of
the
best
investments
i
could
make
to
add
a
newspaper
to
my
other
properties
now
i
am
certainly
not
the
sort
of
capitalist
portrayed
by
cartoonists
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
who
would
subvert
the
freedom
of
the
press
by
handpicking
an
editor
and
telling
him
what
to
say
i
think
the
proof
of
this
as
well
as
of
my
broadmindedness
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
paper
i
chose
to
buy
was
the
and
the
editor
i
retained
was
william
rufus
le
ffaçasé
the
had
lost
both
circulation
and
money
since
it
had
so
to
speak
no
home
base
but
moved
perhaps
by
sentiment
i
was
not
deterred
from
buying
it
for
this
reason
and
anyway
it
was
purchasable
at
a
more
reasonable
figure
on
this
account
small
circulation
or
no
it
or
rather
le
ffaçasé
himself
still
possessed
that
intangible
thing
called
prestige
and
i
was
satisfied
with
my
bargain
le
ffaçasé
showed
no
reluctance
as
why
indeed
should
he
to
continue
as
managingeditor
and
acted
toward
me
as
though
there
had
never
been
any
previous
association
but
i
did
not
object
to
this
harmless
eccentricity
as
a
smallerminded
person
might
have
as
publisher
i
named
general
thario
i
never
knew
exactly
what
purpose
a
publisher
serves
but
it
seemed
necessary
for
every
newspaper
to
have
one
whatever
the
duties
of
the
office
it
left
the
general
plenty
of
time
to
attend
to
the
concerns
of
consolidated
pemmican
i
fed
the
paper
judiciously
with
money
and
it
was
not
long
before
it
regained
most
of
the
circulation
it
had
lost
there
was
no
doubt
the
grass
our
ally
to
such
good
purpose
in
the
war
had
definitely
slowed
down
now
it
was
looked
upon
as
a
fixture
a
part
of
the
american
heritage
a
natural
phenomenon
which
had
outlived
its
sensational
period
and
come
to
be
taken
for
granted
botanists
pointed
out
that
despite
its
ability
to
sheathe
itself
against
a
chill
had
never
flourished
in
cold
areas
and
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
the
inoculated
grass
even
with
its
abnormal
metabolism
could
withstand
climates
foreign
to
its
habit
it
was
true
it
had
touched
in
one
place
the
arctic
tundra
but
it
was
confidently
expected
this
excursion
would
soon
cease
the
high
peaks
of
the
rockies
with
the
heavy
winter
snowdrifts
lying
between
them
promised
no
permanent
hospitality
and
what
seeds
blew
through
the
passes
and
lighted
on
the
great
plains
were
generally
isolated
by
saltbands
and
since
they
were
confined
to
comparatively
small
clumps
they
were
easily
wiped
out
by
salt
or
fire
to
all
appearance
the
grass
was
satiated
and
content
to
remain
crouching
over
what
it
had
won
only
a
minority
argued
that
in
its
new
form
it
might
be
infinitely
adaptable
before
when
stopped
it
had
produced
seeds
capable
of
bearing
the
parent
strain
so
now
they
argued
it
would
in
time
acclimate
itself
to
more
rigorous
temperatures
among
these
pessimists
miss
francis
emerging
from
welldeserved
obscurity
hysterically
ranged
herself
she
prophesied
new
sudden
and
sweeping
advances
and
demanded
money
and
effort
equal
to
that
expended
in
the
late
war
be
turned
to
combating
the
grass
as
if
taxes
were
not
already
outrageously
high
those
in
authority
with
a
little
judicious
advice
from
persons
of
standing
quite
properly
disregarded
her
querulous
importunities
the
whole
matter
of
dealing
with
the
weed
was
by
now
in
the
hands
of
a
permanent
body
the
federal
disruptions
commission
this
group
had
spent
the
first
six
months
of
its
existence
exactly
defining
and
asserting
its
jurisdiction
which
seemed
to
spread
just
as
the
vegetation
calling
it
into
being
did
and
the
second
six
months
wrangling
with
the
federal
trade
commission
over
certain
cease
and
desist
orders
issued
to
firms
using
allusions
to
the
grass
on
the
labels
of
their
products
thereby
implying
they
were
as
vigorous
or
of
as
wide
application
as
the
representation
the
disruptions
commission
had
no
objection
in
principle
to
this
castigation
they
merely
thought
it
should
have
come
from
their
regulatory
hands
but
with
the
end
of
the
war
a
new
spirit
animated
the
honorable
members
of
the
commission
and
as
a
token
of
revived
energy
they
issued
a
stern
directive
that
no
two
groups
engaged
in
antigraminous
research
were
to
pool
their
knowledge
for
competition
the
commission
argued
in
the
sixtyseven
page
order
spurred
enthusiasm
and
the
rivalry
between
workers
would
the
sooner
produce
a
solution
having
settled
this
basically
important
issue
they
turned
their
attention
to
investigating
the
slower
progress
of
the
grass
to
determine
whether
it
was
permanent
or
temporary
and
whether
its
present
sluggishness
could
be
turned
to
good
account
as
a
sort
of
side
project
perhaps
to
show
the
wideness
of
their
scope
they
undertook
as
well
to
study
the
reasons
for
the
failure
of
the
wartime
inoculation
of
the
steppes
as
contrasted
with
the
original
too
successful
california
one
they
planned
a
compilation
of
their
findings
tentatively
scheduled
to
cover
a
hundred
and
fortyseven
foliovolumes
which
would
remain
the
basic
work
for
all
approaching
the
problem
of
attacking
the
grass
and
as
an
important
public
figure
who
had
some
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
subject
they
requested
me
to
visit
at
my
own
expense
the
newest
outposts
of
the
weed
and
favor
them
with
my
observations
i
was
not
averse
to
the
suggestion
for
the
authority
of
the
commission
would
admit
me
to
areas
closed
to
ordinary
citizens
and
i
was
toying
with
the
idea
it
might
be
possible
in
some
way
to
use
the
devilgrass
as
an
ingredient
in
our
food
products
george
thario
having
shown
in
many
ways
he
was
growing
stale
on
the
job
and
in
need
of
a
vacation
i
decided
to
take
him
with
me
besides
if
the
thought
of
using
the
weed
as
a
source
of
cheap
rawmaterial
came
to
anything
the
engagement
of
his
interest
at
an
early
stage
would
increase
his
usefulness
before
setting
out
for
the
field
i
read
reports
of
investigators
on
the
spot
and
was
disquieted
to
note
a
unanimous
mention
of
new
stirrings
on
the
edges
of
the
green
glacier
i
decided
to
lose
no
time
and
we
set
out
at
once
in
my
personal
plane
for
a
mountain
lodge
kindly
offered
by
a
business
acquaintance
here
for
the
next
few
weeks
keeping
in
touch
with
my
manifold
affairs
only
by
telephone
joe
and
i
devoted
ourselves
to
observing
the
grass
or
rather
i
did
george
thario
idea
of
gathering
data
differed
radically
from
mine
i
feel
safe
to
say
as
well
as
from
that
of
almost
any
other
intelligent
man
in
a
way
he
reminded
me
of
the
cameraman
slafe
in
his
brooding
obliviousness
to
everything
except
the
grass
but
slafe
had
been
doing
a
job
for
which
he
was
being
paid
whereas
joe
was
only
yielding
to
his
own
mood
for
hours
he
lay
flat
on
his
belly
staring
through
binoculars
at
other
times
he
wandered
about
the
edge
looking
at
feeling
and
smelling
it
and
once
i
saw
him
bend
down
and
nibble
at
it
like
a
sheep
you
know
a
w
he
observed
enthusiastically
he
always
called
me
a
w
with
just
enough
of
a
curious
intonation
to
make
it
doubtful
whether
the
use
of
the
initials
was
respectful
or
satirical
you
know
a
w
i
understand
those
fellows
who
went
and
chucked
themselves
into
the
grass
it
sublime
it
has
never
happened
in
nature
before
ive
read
newspaper
and
magazine
accounts
and
either
the
writers
have
no
eyes
or
else
they
lie
for
the
hell
of
it
they
talk
about
the
brown
of
the
flowers
but
a
w
ive
seen
the
flowers
myself
and
theyre
a
vivid
glorious
purple
have
you
noticed
the
iridescent
sparkle
when
the
wind
ripples
the
blades
all
the
colors
of
the
spectrum
against
the
background
of
that
marvelous
green
there
nothing
marvelous
about
it
i
told
him
a
little
irritably
it
used
to
be
really
green
a
bright
even
color
but
up
here
where
it
high
and
cold
it
doesnt
look
much
different
from
ordinary
devilgrass
dirty
and
ugly
i
thought
his
enthusiasm
distinctly
out
of
place
in
the
circumstances
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
me
but
went
on
dreamily
and
the
sounds
it
makes
my
god
a
w
a
composer
give
half
the
years
of
his
life
to
reproduce
those
sounds
high
and
piercing
soft
and
muted
creating
tonepoems
and
études
there
in
its
lonely
grandeur
i
have
spoken
before
of
the
noise
produced
by
the
weed
a
thunderous
crackling
and
snapping
attributable
to
its
extraordinary
rate
of
growth
during
its
dormancy
the
sound
had
ceased
and
in
the
mountains
at
least
was
replaced
by
different
notes
and
combinations
of
notes
as
the
wind
blew
through
its
culms
and
scraped
the
tough
stems
against
each
other
occasionally
these
ululations
produced
reflections
extremely
pleasing
more
often
it
hurt
the
ears
with
a
shrieking
discordance
but
even
at
its
best
it
fell
far
short
to
my
mind
and
i
suppose
i
may
say
i
as
sensitive
to
beauty
as
anybody
of
meriting
joe
extravagant
rhapsodies
but
he
was
entranced
beyond
the
soberness
of
commonsense
he
filled
notebooks
those
thick
pulppapered
volumes
which
children
are
supposed
to
use
in
school
but
never
do
with
his
reactions
in
idle
moments
when
he
was
away
i
glanced
through
them
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
incoherent
meterless
poems
lists
of
adjectives
strained
interpretations
of
the
actions
of
the
grass
and
many
musical
notations
which
seemed
to
get
no
farther
than
a
repetitive
and
faltering
start
i
reproduce
a
few
pages

the

chaotic

who

in
all
this

i
thought
there
might
be
a
curious
and
interesting
little
observation
about
animal
migration
if
one
could
trust
the
accuracy
of
an
imagination
more
romantic
than
factual
and
i
reduced
it
to
some
kind
of
coherence
and
added
it
not
only
to
my
report
for
the
federal
disruptions
commission
but
for
the
dispatches
i
found
time
to
send
in
to
the
i
hardly
suppose
it
is
necessary
to
mention
that
by
now
my
literary
talents
could
no
longer
be
denied
or
ignored
and
that
these
items
were
not
edited
nor
garbled
but
appeared
exactly
as
i
had
written
them
boxed
and
doubleleaded
on
page
one
though
the
matter
was
really
trivial
and
in
confessing
it
i
do
mind
admitting
all
of
us
are
subject
to
petty
vanities
i
was
gratified
to
notice
too
that
le
ffaçasé
had
the
discernment
to
realize
how
much
the
public
appreciated
my
handling
the
news
about
the
grass
for
he
advertised
my
contributions
lavishly
in
my
news
stories
i
could
tell
no
less
than
the
full
truth
which
was
that
the
grass
after
remaining
patriotically
dormant
throughout
the
war
except
for
the
spurt
northward
to
destroy
the
remnants
of
the
invading
host
had
once
more
set
out
upon
the
march
the
loss
of
color
i
had
pointed
out
to
joe
was
less
apparent
each
day
of
our
stay
as
the
old
vividness
revived
with
its
renewed
energy
and
the
sweet
music
which
entranced
him
gave
place
to
the
familiar
crackling
growing
louder
with
each
foot
it
advanced
down
the
slope
culminating
every
so
often
in
thunderous
explosions
for
down
the
thousand
mile
incline
of
the
mississippibasin
it
was
pouring
with
accelerating
tempo
engulfing
or
driving
everything
before
it
it
was
the
old
story
of
the
creeping
stolons
the
steppedup
tangled
mass
and
the
great
towering
bulk
behind
the
falling
forward
and
then
the
continued
headway
once
more
the
eastbound
trains
and
highways
clogged
with
refugees
my
affairs
not
permitting
a
longer
stay
i
returned
to
new
york
but
i
could
not
pry
joe
from
his
preoccupation
a
w
he
argued
i
be
no
more
use
to
consolidated
pemmican
right
now
than
groundglass
in
a
ham
sandwich
my
backside
might
be
in
a
swivelchair
but
my
soul
would
be
right
up
here
it
whitman
translated
visibly
and
tangibly
a
w
lovely
and
soothing
death
undulate
round
and
round
besides
youve
got
the
old
man
now
he
worth
more
to
you
than
i
ever
will
be
he
loves
business
it
just
like
the
army
without
a
doddering
old
generalstaff
to
pull
him
back
every
time
he
gets
enthusiastic
if
anyone
else
in
my
organization
had
talked
like
this
i
would
have
fired
him
immediately
but
i
was
sure
down
underneath
his
aesthetic
poses
and
artistic
pretensions
there
was
a
foundation
of
good
commonsense
inherited
from
the
general
give
the
boy
his
head
i
thought
let
him
stay
here
and
rhapsodize
till
he
gets
sick
of
it
come
back
the
better
executive
for
having
got
it
out
of
his
system
also
as
he
himself
pointed
out
i
had
his
father
to
rely
on
and
he
was
a
man
to
whip
up
production
if
ever
there
was
one
the
chief
purpose
of
my
visit
to
the
grass
was
at
least
momentarily
a
failure
there
was
little
point
sampling
and
analyzing
the
weed
for
its
possible
use
as
an
ingredient
in
a
food
concentrate
if
it
were
impossible
to
set
up
a
permanent
place
to
gather
and
process
it
i
wo
say
i
considered
my
time
wasted
but
its
employment
had
not
been
profitable
but
even
immersed
in
the
everexpanding
affairs
of
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
industries
as
we
now
called
the
parent
company
i
could
not
get
away
from
the
grass
each
hour
eastward
thrust
was
reported
in
detail
by
an
hysterical
radio
and
every
day
the
newspapers
printed
maps
showing
the
newly
overrun
territory
once
more
the
grass
was
the
most
prominent
thought
in
men
minds
not
only
over
the
land
of
its
being
but
throughout
the
world
scientists
of
every
nationality
studied
it
at
firsthand
and
only
strict
laws
and
rigid
searches
by
customs
inspectors
prevented
the
importation
of
specimens
for
dissection
in
their
own
laboratories
the
formula
of
miss
francis
now
at
length
revealed
in
its
entirety
was
discussed
by
everyone
there
was
hardly
a
man
woman
or
child
who
did
not
dream
of
finding
some
means
to
destroy
or
halt
the
grass
and
thereby
make
of
himself
an
unparalleled
benefactor
a
new
crop
of
suggestions
was
harvested
by
the
in
addition
to
the
old
they
included
such
expedients
as
reinoculating
the
grass
with
the
metamorphizer
in
the
hope
either
of
its
cannibalistically
feeding
upon
itself
or
becoming
so
infected
with
giantism
as
to
blow
up
and
burst
the
failure
of
the
experiment
on
the
russian
steppes
was
ignored
or
forgotten
by
these
contributors
building
barriers
of
dryice
and
the
use
of
infrared
lamps
one
of
the
proposals
which
tickled
the
popular
imagination
was
a
plan
for
vast
areas
to
be
roofed
and
glassenclosed
giant
greenhouses
to
offer
refuge
for
mankind
in
the
very
teeth
of

everyone
except

in

ones
who
would
have
to
approve
the
expenditure
of
the
vast
sums
necessary
thought
there
was
something
in
the
idea
but
nothing
was
done
about
it
many
believing
physical
means
could
be
of
little
avail
suggested
metaphysical
ones
and
these
were
always
punctiliously
printed
by
the
they
ranged
from
disregarding
the
existence
of
the
weed
and
carrying
on
ordinary
life
as
though
it
presented
no
threat
through
holding
the
correct
thought
praying
daily
for
its
miraculous
disappearance
preferably
at
a
simultaneous
moment
to
reorganizing
the
spiritual
concepts
of

totality

the
bumping
of
the
car

the
cow
ive
had
to
leave
the
lodge
of
course
and
spend
my
nights
in
a
thin
house
with
a
roof
shaped
like
two
playingcards
with
the
misleading
sign
in
punishment
crippled
half
fallen
from
its
support
accommodated
if
accommodation
be
empty

with

then
punishment
was
unrighteous
i
shall
move
on
soon
perhaps
for
the
worse
since
there
is
green
now
beneath
the

if
i
can
ever
come
away
i
shall

i
not

give
my

tell

i

but
family
feeling
makes
it

joe
i
showed
the
letter
to
the
general
expecting
him
perhaps
to
be
annoyed
by
joe
instability
but
he
merely
said
boy
shouldnt
be
wasting
his
talents
put
it
in
sound
orchestrate
it
just
as
joe
enthusiasm
covered
only
one
aspect
of
the
grass
so
his
retreat
from
lodge
to
wayside
hostel
to
city
hotel
embraced
only
a
minute
sector
of
the
great
advance
neither
moral
nor
brute
force
slowed
the
weed
it
clutched
the
upper
reaches
of
the
rio
grande
and
ran
down
its
course
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
like
quicksilver
in
a
broken
thermometer
it
went
through
colorado
oklahoma
and
kansas
it
nibbled
at
the
forks
of
the
platte
it
left
behind
the
great
salt
lake
like
a
chip
diamond
lost
in
an
enormous
setting
there
is
no
benefit
to
be
derived
from
looking
at
the
darker
side
of
things
and
indeed
it
is
a
universal
observation
that
there
is
no
misfortune
without
its
compensation
the
loss
of
the
great
cattlegrazing
areas
of
the
west
increased
the
demand
for
our
concentrated
foods
by
the
hundredfold
we
paid
no
duty
on
the
products
shipped
in
from
our
south
american
factories
for
they
competed
only
with
ourselves
and
we
did
the
country
the
humanitarian
service
of
preventing
a
famine
by
rushing
carload
after
carload
westward
rising
above
all
thoughts
of
petty
gain
by
making
no
increase
whatever
in
our
prices
despite
the
expanding
demand
about
this
time
it
became
indisputable
that
button
gwynnet
fles
was
no
longer
of
value
to
consolidated
pemmican
his
yankee
shrewdness
and
caution
which
enabled
him
to
run
the
corporation
when
it
was
merely
a
name
and
a
quotation
on
the
stockmarket
had
the
limits
of
its
virtues
he
was
extraordinarily
provincial
in
outlook
and
quite
unable
to
see
the
concern
on
a
world
scale
in
view
of
our
vast
expansion
such
narrowness
had
become
an
unbearable
hindrance
i
had
permitted
him
to
hold
a
limited
number
of
shares
and
to
act
nominally
as
secretary
in
order
to
comply
with
the
regulations
of
the
security
and
exchange
commission
but
now
it
was
expedient
to
add
to
our
officers
directors
of
other
companies
whose
fields
were
complementary
to
ours
besides
in
general
thario
i
had
a
much
abler
assistant
and
so
perhaps
reluctantly
because
of
my
oversensitivity
i
displaced
fles
and
making
the
general
president
of
the
corporation
i
accepted
the
post
of
chairman
of
the
board
i
must
say
he
took
a
perfectly
natural
business
move
with
unbecoming
illgrace
it
was
mine
mr
weener
you
know
it
was
mine
and
i
did
not
protest
when
you
stole
it
i
worked
loyally
and
unselfishly
for
you
it
isnt
the
money
mr
weener
really
it
isnt
it
the
idea
of
being
thrown
out
of
my
own
business
at
least
let
me
stay
on
the
board
of
directors
youll
never
have
any
trouble
from
me
i
promise
you
that
it
distressed
me
to
reject
his
abject
plea
but
my
hands
were
tied
by
my
devotion
to
the
welfare
of
the
company
besides
he
annoyed
me
by
his
palpably
untrue
reference
to
what
had
been
a
legitimate
transaction
never
giving
a
thought
to
my
generosity
in
not
exposing
his
chicanery
nor
the
fact
that
the
dummy
he
manipulated
bore
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
firm
i
had
brought
by
my
own
effort
to
its
present
size
leaving
matters
in
the
able
hands
of
general
thario
after
warning
joe
he
had
better
soon
return
to
his
father
assistance
i
went
abroad
to
arrange
for
wider
european
representation
there
i
found
a
curious
eagerness
to
be
of
help
to
me
and
almost
fawning
servility
antipathetic
to
my
democratic
american
notions
oddly
enough
the
europeans
looked
upon
the
united
states
as
a
doomed
country
thinking
i
like
some
members
of
our
wealthier
classes
had
come
to
escape
disruption
and
dislocation
at
home
only
in
england
did
i
find
the
belief
prevalent
that
the
americans
would
somehow
muddle
through
because
afterall
theyre
the
same
sort
of
chaps
we
are
you
know
after
a
highly
successful
trip
i
returned
home
the
same
day
the
grass
reached
the
headwaters
of
the
mississippi
william
rufus
le
ffaçasé
astonished
me
as
well
as
every
newspaperman
in
the
country
by
resigning
as
editor
of
the
a
post
he
had
held
before
many
of
its
reporters
were
born
when
i
phoned
him
to
come
to
my
office
and
explain
himself
he
refused
in
tones
and
manner
i
had
not
heard
from
any
man
since
the
days
when
i
had
wasted
my
talents
as
a
subordinate
having
none
of
the
pettiness
of
pride
which
makes
some
men
fearful
of
their
position
since
he
would
not
come
to
my
office
i
went
to
his
there
he
shocked
me
for
the
third
time
a
high
glossy
collar
a
flowing
and
figured
cravat
concealed
the
famous
diamond
stud
while
instead
of
the
snuffbox
his
hands
hovered
over
a
package
of
cheap
cigarettes
weener
he
rasped
jettisoning
all
those
courtesies
to
which
i
had
become
accustomed
i
never
thought
i
be
glad
to
see
your
vapid
face
again
unless
on
a
marble
slab
in
some
city
morgue
but
now
youre
here
moneybags
slapping
the
insides
of
your
thighs
in
place
of
the
scrotum
for
which
you
could
have
no
possible
use
i
am
delighted
to
tell
you
in
person
to
take
my
paper
my
paper
sir
note
that
well
for
all
your
dirty
pawings
could
not
make
it
anything
but
mine
and
supposit
it
i
hope
it
frets
you
weener
for
the
sake
of
your
sniveling
but
immortal
soul
i
sincerely
hope
it
rasps
you
like
a
misplaced
hairshirt
you
will
get
some
miserable
lickspittle
to
take
my
place
some
mangy
bookkeeping
pimp
with
a
permanentwaved
wife
and
three
snottynosed
brats
but
the
spirit
and
guts
of
the
depart
with
w
r
le
ffaçasé
i
disregarded
both
his
illmanners
and
his
bombast
what
the
matter
bill
i
asked
kindly
is
it
more
money
you
can
write
your
own
ticket
you
know
within
reason
of
course
his
fingers
looked
for
the
snuffbox
but
found
only
the
cigarettes
which
he
inspected
puzzledly
weener
no
man
could
do
you
justice
you
are
the
bloody
prototype
of
all
the
arselickers
panders
arsonists
kidnapers
cutthroats
pickpockets
abortionists
pilferers
cheats
forgers
sneakthieves
sharpers
and
blackmailers
since
jacob
swindled
his
brother
do
not
fawn
upon
me
little
man
i
am
too
old
to
want
women
or
money
the
sands
are
running
out
and
i
shall
never
now
read
the
immortable
hobbes
but
i
not
die
in
your
bloody
harness
in
me
you
do
not
see
the
man
who
picked
up
the
torch
of
franklin
and
greeley
and
dana
where
henry
watterson
dropped
it
loose
of
your
gangrenous
chains
you
behold
the
freelance
correspondent
of
the
north
american
newspaper
alliance
the
man
who
will
devote
his
declining
years
to
reporting
in
the
terse
and
vivid
prose
for
which
he
is
justly
famous
the
progress
of
the
grass
which
strangles
the
country
as
you
have
tried
to
strangle
me
again
i
put
personal
feelings
aside
if
your
mind
is
really
made
up
we
want
your
stuff
for
the
bill
sir
you
may
want
i
hope
the
condition
persists
there
being
no
profit
in
arguing
with
a
madman
i
made
arrangements
to
replace
him
immediately
i
reproduce
here
not
for
selfjustification
which
would
be
superfluous
but
merely
for
what
amusement
it
may
afford
one
of
his
accounts
which
appeared
in
the
columns
of
so
many
third
and
fourth
rate
newspapers
i
wo
say
it
shows
the
decay
of
a
once
possibly
great
mind
but
it
certainly
reveals
that
the
suffered
no
irreparable
loss
today
at
dubuque
iowa
the
mississippi
was
crossed
not
by
redmen
in
canoes
nor
white
on
logs
or
clumsy
rafts
nor
yet
by
multiwheeled
locomotives
gliding
over
steel
bridges
nor
airplanes
so
high
the
wide
stream
was
a
thread
below
nature
and
devastation
hand
in
hand
for
the
moment
one
and
the
same
crossed
it
today
as
quantrell
or
kirby
smith
or
nathan
bedford
forrest
crossed
it
sabers
glittering
so
many
forgotten
years
ago
but
if
the
men
in
gray
and
butternut
raided
a
store
or
burned
a
tavern
they
thought
it
a
mighty
victory
and
went
home
rejoicing
the
green
invader
is
an
occupier
and
colonizer
come
to
remain
for
all
time
leaving
no
town
no
road
no
farm
where
it
has
passed
a
few
weeks
ago
dubuque
was
still
here
quiet
old
and
pleasant
the
butt
of
affectionate
jokes
the
grass
still
miles
away
the
population
still
hopeful
of
salvation
and
then
because
of
the
panic
the
frantic
scurry
to
save
things
once
valuable
and
now
only
valued
no
one
noticed
when
a
betraying
wind
blew
seeds
beyond
the
town
over
the
river
to
find
receptive
soil
on
the
wisconsin
side
the
seeds
germinated
the
clump
flourished
it
cut
the
highway
and
reached
down
the
banks
into
the
mississippi
waiting
and
while
it
waited
it
built
up
greater
bulk
for
itself
behind
and
beside
each
day
it
pushed
a
little
farther
toward
midstream
drowning
its
own
foremost
runners
so
those
behind
might
have
solidity
to
advance
upon
meanwhile
from
the
west
the
continent
imposed
upon
a
continent
came
closer
the
other
day
dubuque
went
its
weathered
bricks
and
immature
stucco
alike
obliterated
the
grass
ran
out
like
a
bather
on
a
cold
morning
hastening
to
the
water
before
timidity
halts
him
although
i
was
watching
i
could
not
tell
you
at
what
exact
instant
the
gap
was
closed
at
what
moment
the
runners
from
one
clump
intertwined
with
those
of
the
other
but
such
a
moment
did
occur
and
shedding
water
like
a
surfacing
whale
the
united
bodies
rose
from
the
riverbed
to
form
a
verdant
bridge
you
could
not
walk
across
it
at
least
no
man
i
know
would
want
to
try
but
it
gives
the
illusion
of
permanency
no
work
of
man
stone
or
steel
or
concrete
has
ever
given
and
it
is
a
dismaying
thing
to
see
trade
taken
over
by
nature
in
this
fashion
the
bridge
is
a
dam
also
all
the
debris
from
the
upper
reaches
collects
against
it
and
soon
there
will
be
floods
to
add
to
the
other
distress
the
grass
has
brought
more
than
half
the
country
is
gone
now
the
territories
pillaged
from
mexico
argued
from
britain
bought
from
france
have
all
been
lost
only
the
original
states
and
florida
remain
shall
we
be
more
successful
in
defending
our
basic
land
than
all
the
acquisitions
of
a
century
and
a
half
but
why
add
any
more
dry
senile
without
feeling
my
only
wonder
was
that
his
stuff
was
printed
even
in
the
obscure
media
where
it
appeared
with
twothirds
of
the
country
absorbed
and
a
hundred
fifty
million
people
squeezed
into
what
was
left
economic
conditions
became
worse
than
ever
no
european
ghetto
was
as
crowded
as
our
cities
and
no
overpopulated
countryside
farmed
so
intensively
to
so
little
purpose
an
almost
complete
cessation
of
employment
except
in
the
remnant
of
the
export
trade
valueless
money
english
shillings
and
poundnotes
illegally
circulated
being
the
prized
medium
of
exchange
starvation
only
irritated
rather
than
relieved
by
the
doles
of
food
seized
from
the
farmers
and
grudgingly
handed
out
to
the
urban
dwellers
each
election
saw
another
party
in
power
the
sole
demand
of
the
voters
being
for
an
administration
capable
of
stopping
the
grass
since
none
was
successful
the
dissatisfaction
and
anger
grew
together
with
the
panic
and
dislocation
messiahs
and
fuehrers
sprang
up
thickly
riots
in
all
cities
were
daily
occurrences
rating
no
more
than
obscure
paragraphs
while
in
many
areas
gangs
of
hoodlums
actually
maintained
themselves
in
power
for
weeks
at
a
time
ruling
their
possessions
like
feudal
baronies
and
exacting
tribute
from
all
travelers
through
their
domain
immigration
had
long
ago
been
stopped
but
now
the
government
in
order
to
preserve
what
space
was
left
for
genuine
americans
canceled
the
naturalization
of
all
foreignborn
and
ordered
them
immediately
deported
all
jews
who
had
been
in
the
country
less
than
three
generations
were
shipped
to
palestine
and
the
others
deprived
of
political
rights
in
order
to
encourage
them
to
leave
also
the
negroes
who
except
for
a
period
less
than
a
decade
in
length
had
never
had
any
political
or
civil
rights
planned
a
mass
migration
to
africa
a
project
enthusiastically
spurred
by
such
elder
statesmen
as
the
learned
maybank
and
the
judicious
rankin
this
movement
proved
abortive
when
statisticians
showed
there
were
not
enough
liquid
assets
among
the
colored
population
to
pay
a
profit
on
their
transportation
an
attempt
to
oust
all
catholics
failed
also
for
the
rather
odd
reason
that
many
of
the
minor
protestant
sects
joined
in
a
body
to
oppose
it
the
latterday
saints
now
busy
building
new
deseret
in
central
australia
and
the
church
of
christ
scientist
as
well
as
the
episcopalians
doweyites
shakers
christadelphians
and
the
congregation
of
the
chapel
of
the
former
and
latter
rains
presented
a
united
front
for
tolerance
and
equity
an
astonishing
byproduct
of
the
national
despair
and
turmoil
was
the
feverish
activity
in
all
fields
of
creative
endeavor
novels
streamed
from
the
presses
volumes
of
poetry
became
substantial
items
on
publishers
lists
and
those
which
failed
to
find
a
publisher
were
mimeographed
and
peddled
to
a
receptive
public
while
painters
working
with
renascence
enthusiasm
turned
out
great
canvases
as
fast
as
their
brushes
could
spread
the
oils
we
had
suddenly
become
a
nation
madly
devoted
to
the
arts
when
orpheus
crisodd
devilgrass
symphony
was
first
played
in
carnegie
hall
an
audience
three
times
as
great
as
that
admitted
had
to
be
accommodated
outside
with
loudspeakers
and
when
the
awesome
crescendo
of
horns
drums
and
broken
crockery
rubbed
over
slate
surfaces
announced
the
climax
of
the
sixth
movement
the
crowds
wept
even
for
mozart
the
hall
was
full
or
practically
full
in
the
lively
arts
the
impact
of
the
grass
was
more
overt
on
the
comicpage
superman
daily
pushed
it
back
and
there
was
great
regret
his
activities
were
limited
to
a
fourcolor
process
while
terry
lee
and
flash
gordon
everinspirited
by
the
sharp
outlines
of
mammaryglands
also
saved
the
country
even
lil
abner
and
snuffy
smith
battled
the
vegetation
while
no
one
but
jiggs
remained
absolutely
impervious
the
was
heard
on
every
radio
and
came
from
every
adolescent
phonograph
until
it
was
succeeded
by
bitty
seed
made
awfoo
nasty
perhaps
the
most
notable
feature
of
this
period
was
a
preoccupation
with
permanency
jerrybuilding
architectural
mode
since
the
first
falsefront
was
erected
over
the
first
smalltown
store
practically
disappeared
the
skyscrapers
were
no
longer
steel
skeletons
with
thin
facings
of
stone
hung
upon
them
like
a
slattern
apron
while
the
practice
of
daubing
mud
on
chickenwire
hastily
laid
over
paper
was
discontinued
everyone
wanted
to
build
for
all
time
even
though
the
grass
might
seize
upon
their
effort
next
week
in
new
york
the
cathedral
of
st
john
the
divine
was
finally
completed
and
a
new
one
dedicated
to
st
george
begun
the
demand
for
enduring
woods
replaced
the
market
for
green
pine
and
men
planned
homes
to
accommodate
their
greatgrandchildren
and
not
to
attract
prospective
buyers
before
the
plaster
cracked
naturally
forwardlooking
men
like
stuart
thario
and
myself
though
we
had
every
respect
for
culture
were
not
swamped
by
this
sudden
urge
to
encourage
the
effervescent
side
of
life
our
feet
were
still
upon
the
ground
and
though
we
knew
symphonies
and
novels
and
cathedrals
had
their
place
it
was
important
not
to
lose
sight
of
fundamentals
while
we
approved
in
principle
the
desire
for
permanency
we
took
reality
into
account
we
had
every
faith
in
the
future
of
the
country
being
certain
a
way
would
be
found
before
long
to
stop
the
encroachments
of
the
weed
nevertheless
as
a
proper
precaution
a
safeguarding
counterbalance
to
our
own
enthusiastic
patriotism
we
invested
our
surplus
funds
in
consols
and
european
bonds
while
hastening
our
plans
for
new
factories
on
other
continents
i
sure
george
thario
must
have
been
a
great
cross
to
his
father
although
the
general
never
spoke
of
him
save
in
the
most
affectionate
terms
living
like
a
tramp
he
sent
a
snapshot
once
showing
him
with
a
long
starveling
beard
dressed
in
careless
overalls
his
arm
over
the
shoulder
of
a
slovenly
looking
girl
he
stayed
always
on
the
edge
of
the
advancing
weed
moving
eastward
only
when
forced
he
wrote
from
galena

the

his

him
when
he

a

all

of

in
contrast
i
can
not
forbear
to
quote
le
ffaçasé
though
his
faults
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale
were
just
as
glaring
it
is
in
kentucky
now
birthstate
of
abraham
lincoln
sixteenth
president
of
the
united
states
a
country
which
once
stretched
south
of
the
parallel
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
i
have
been
traveling
extensively
in
what
is
left
of
lincoln
nation
remarked
chesterton
emigrate
this
country
was
settled
by
the
poor
and
thriftless
and
now
few
more
than
the
poor
and
thriftless
remain
in
it
let
me
try
to
present
an
overall
picture
what
is
left
of
the
country
has
become
a
nineteenth
century
ireland
with
all
economic
power
in
the
hands
of
absentees
it
is
not
that
everyone
below
the
level
of
a
millionaire
is
too
stupid
to
foresee
possibility
of
complete
destruction
or
the
middle
and
lower
classes
virtuously
imbued
with
such
fanatical
patriotism
they
are
prepared
for
mass
suicide
rather
than
leave
because
dukes
emigrating
and
sending
the
price
of
shippingspace
into
brackets
which
make
the
export
of
any
commodity
but
diamonds
or
their
own
hides
a
dubious
investment
even
the
pawning
of
all
the
family
assets
would
not
buy
steerage
passage
for
a
year
old
baby
besides
there
are
not
enough
bottoms
in
the
world
to
transport
a
hundred
and
fifty
million
people
if
the
grass
is
not
stopped
except
for
a
negligible
few
it
will
cover
americans
when
it
covers
america
no
wonder
a
strange
and
conflicting
spirit
animates
our
people
apathy
yes
there
is
apathy
you
can
see
it
on
the
faces
in
a
line
of
relief
clients
wondering
how
long
an
industrially
stagnant
country
can
continue
their
dole
even
though
now
it
consists
of
nothing
but
unpalatable
chemicals
socalled
despair
certainly
the
riots
and
lootings
especially
the
intensified
ones
recently
in
cleveland
and
pittsburgh
are
symptoms
of
it
the
overcrowded
churches
the
terrific
increase
in
drugging
and
drinking
the
sex
orgies
which
have
been
taking
place
practically
in
the
open
in
baltimore
and
philadelphia
and
boston
are
stigmata
of
desperation
hope
i
suppose
there
is
hope
congress
sits
in
uninterrupted
session
and
senators
lend
their
voices
night
and
day
to
the
destruction
of
the
grass
the
federal
disruptions
commission
has
published
the
eleventh
volume
of
its
report
and
is
currently
holding
hearings
to
determine
how
closely
the
extinct
buffalograss
is
related
to
every
research
laboratory
in
the
country
except
those
whose
staffs
and
equipment
have
been
moved
with
their
proprietary
industries
is
expending
its
energies
in
seeking
a
salvation
perhaps
only
in
the
deep
south
as
yet
protected
by
the
width
of
the
lower
mississippi
is
there
something
approaching
a
genuine
hope
although
ironically
that
may
be
the
product
of
ignorance
here
the
overlords
have
gone
and
the
poor
whites
unsupported
by
an
explicit
kinship
have
withdrawn
into
complete
listlessness
some
black
men
have
fled
but
to
most
the
grass
is
a
mere
bogey
incapable
of
frightening
those
who
have
survived
so
much
now
for
the
first
time
since
the
polls
are
open
to
all
and
there
are
again
negro
governors
and
black
legislatures
and
they
are
legislating
as
if
forever
farm
tenancy
has
been
abolished
the
great
plantations
have
been
expropriated
and
made
cooperative
the
homestead
act
of
has
been
applied
in
the
south
and
every
citizen
is
entitled
to
claim
a
quartersection
there
is
a
great
deal
of
laughter
at
this
childish
lawmaking
but
it
goes
on
changing
the
face
of
the
region
the
lawmakers
themselves
not
at
all
averse
to
the
joke
everything
le
ffaçasé
wrote
was
not
only
dull
but
biased
and
unjust
as
well
it
was
true
capital
was
leaving
the
country
rapidly
but
what
other
course
had
it
to
stay
and
attempt
to
carry
on
industry
in
the
midst
of
the
demoralization
was
obviously
impractical
the
plants
remained
and
when
a
way
was
found
to
conquer
the
grass
we
would
be
glad
to
reopen
them
for
this
would
be
a
practical
course
just
as
the
flight
of
capital
was
a
practical
course
standards
of
living
were
now
so
reduced
in
the
united
states
it
would
be
more
profitable
to
employ
cheap
american
labor
than
overpaid

or
european

now
no

his

overseeing
our

with
the

before
leaving

indeed
on

joe
had
married
the
female
of
the

or
contracted
some
sort
of
permanent
alliance
with
her
i
never
got
it
quite
straight
and
the
tharios
were
deplorably
careless
about
such
details
and
she
proved
as
eccentric
as
he
was
no
appeal
to

no
pleading
he
forgo
his
morbid
preoccupation
with
the
grass
for
the
sake
of
his
family

move
them
a
w
you
have
seen
it

it

it
ca
you
explain
miraculously
touched
with
the
gift
of
lucidity
for
fact
as
you
are
for
the
fictions
of
production
overhead
and
dividends
oh
not
to
mama
either
she
understands
better
than
i
or
not
at
all
but
to
the
old
man
or
connie
as
a
child
you
learn
for
the
first
time
of
death
the
heart
is
shuttered
in
a
little
cell
too
cruel
for
breathing
the
sun
is
gray
in
an
instant
you
forget
the
sky
is
bright
the
blood
pounds
years
later
the
adolescent
falls
in
love
with
death
primps
his
spirit
for
it
recalls
in
unpresumptuous
brotherhood
shelley
and
keats
and
chatterton
afterward
the
flush
fades
we
are
reconciled
to
life
but
the
promise
is
still
implicit
now
however
it
must
be
earned
awaited
haste
would
destroy
the
savor
the
award
assured
pace
becomes
dignified
but
death
is
not
death
life
is
never
mocked
the
grass
is
not
death
any
more
than
it
is
evil
the
grass
is
the
grass
it
is
me
and
i
am
it
my
father
house
there
are
many
mansions
if
it
were
not
so
i
would
not
have
told
you
no
i
suppose
not
yet
it
hurts
my
liver
to
offer
the
old
boy
incomprehensible
reasons
or
verbiage
like
neurosis
when
all
he
wants
is
to
protect
me
from
my
own
impulses
as
he
protected
me
from
the
army
florence
and
i
delight
in
him
he
comes
again
next
week
if
possible
but
we
can
not
convey
to
him
the
unthinkableness
of
leaving
i
heard
about
this
visit
later
from
the
general
joe
had
scoured
chicago
for
the
alcoholic
commodities
now
practically
unprocurable
and
returned
in
triumph
to
the
couple
furnished
room
there
they
entertained
him
with
two
bottles
of
cointreau
and
a
stone
demijohn
of
cornwhisky
touched
filial
affection
even
drank
the
cointreau
fiddling
stuff
no
wonder
it
was
still
available
in
the
drought

a
man
never
had

all
right
moved
in
circles
perhaps
not
accustomed
bit
rough
in
speech
but
heart
of
gold
give
you
the
shirt
right
off
her
back
hum
manner
of
speaking
know
what
i
mean
but
she
would
not
add
her
persuasions
to
those
of
the
general
got
to
stay
it
not
something
he
sat
down
and
thought
up
the
way
you
plan
dinner
or
whether
blue
goes
good
with
your
new
permanent
he
got
to
stay
because
he
got
to
stay
and
of
course
so
do
i
we
couldnt
be
satisfied
anywhere
we
couldnt
see
the
grass
life
too
dull
away
from
it
but
of
course
that
only
part
it
too
big
to
explain
but
george
joe
as
you
call
him
highly
talented
sensitive
shouldnt
be
allowed
to
decay
the
general
argued
fascination
understand
but
effort
of
will
break
the
spell
europe
birthplace
of
culture
reflection
give
him
a
proper
perspective
chance
to
do
things
even
when
the
evening
lengthened
and
he
became
more
lucid
under
the
stimulus
of
cornwhisky
and
cointreau
he
could
not
shake
them
judicious
retreat
especially
in
the
face
of
overwhelming
superiority
has
always
been
a
military
weapon
and
no
captain
no
matter
how
valiant
has
ever
feared
to
use
it
pop
george
thario
had
retorted
goodhumoredly
you
dragged
in
the
metaphor
not
youve
heard
of
the
alamo
and
vicksburg
and
corregidor
well
this
is
them
all
rolled
into
one
the
first
snows
of
this
ominous
winter
halted
progress
of
the
grass
it
went
sluggish
and
then
dormant
first
in
the
far
north
where
only
the
quick
growingseason
once
producing
cabbages
big
as
hogsheads
had
allowed
it
to
spread
at
a
rate
at
all
comparable
to
its
progress
farther
south
but
by
now
there
could
be
no
doubt
left
that
once
so
sensitive
to
cold
that
it
had
covered
itself
even
in
the
indistinguishable
southern
california
winter
with
a
protective
sheath
had
become
inured
to
frost
and
chill
hibernating
throughout
the
severest
cold
and
coming
back
vigorously
in
the
spring
it
now
extended
from
alaska
to
hudson
bay
covering
all
manitoba
and
parts
of
ontario
it
had
taken
to
itself
minnesota
the
northern
peninsula
of

wisconsin
a
great
chunk
of
illinois
and
stood
baffled
on
the
western
bank
of
the
mississippi
from
cairo
to
its
mouth
the
northwestern
underpopulated
half
of
mexico
was
overrun
the
grass
moving
but
sluggishly
into
the
estados
bordering
the
gulf
coast
i
can
not
say
this
delusive
safety
was
enjoyed
for
there
was
unbelievable
hardship
in
spite
of
the
great
bulk
of
the
coalfields
lying
east
of
the
grass
and
the
vast
quantities
of
oil
and
natural
gas
from
texas
there
was
a
fuel
famine
due
largely
to
the
breakdown
of
the
transportation
system
people
warmed
themselves
after
a
fashion
by
burning
furniture
and
rubbish
in
improvised
stoves
of
course
this
put
an
additional
strain
on
firedepartments
themselves
suffering
from
the
same
lack
of
new
equipment
tires
and
gasoline
afflicting
the
general
public
and
great
conflagrations
swept
through
akron
buffalo
and
hartford
garbage
collection
systems
broke
down
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
clear
the
streets
of
snow
broken
watermains
gaspipes
and
sewers
were
followed
by
typhus
and
typhoid
and
smallpox

cholera
and

plague
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of

relieved
only
in
small

those
refugees
sheltered
in
the
schoolhouses
long
since
closed
when
these
were
made
auxiliary
to
the
inadequate
hospitals
the
strangely
inappropriate
flowering
of
culture
so
profuse
the
year
before
no
longer
bloomed
a
few
invincible
enthusiasts
mufflered
and
raincoated
still
bore
the
icy

of

quorum
of

for
the
precious
remaining
tubes
of

and

while
it
was
presumed
that
in
traditionally
unheated
garrets
orthodox
poets
nourished
their
muse
on

all
enthusiasm
was
individual
property

fear
of

briefly
dormant
but
ever
in
the
background
of
all
minds
the
stream
of
novels
plays
and
poems
dried
up
publishers
amazed
that
what
had
been
profitable
the
year
before
was
no
longer
so
were
finally
convinced
and
stopped
printing
anything
remotely
literate
even
the
newspapers
limped
along
crippledly
their
presses
breaking
down
hourly
their
circulation
and
coverage
alike
dubious
the
streets
were
no
more
safe
at
night
than
in
sixteenth
century
london
even
in
the
greatest
cities
the
lighting
was
erratic
and
in
the
smaller
ones
it
had
been
abandoned
entirely
holdups
by
individuals
had
been
practically
given
up
perhaps
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
any
footpad
getting
away
with
his
loot
before
being
hijacked
by
another
but
small
compact
gangs
made
life
and
property
unsafe
at
night
tempers
were
extraordinarily
short
a
surprised
housebreaker
was
likely
to
add
battery
mayhem
and
arson
to
his
crimes
and
altercations
which
commonly
would
have
terminated
in
nothing
more
violent
than
lurid
epithets
now
frequently
ended
in
murder
since
too
many
of
the
homeless
took
advantage
of
the
law
to
commit
petty
offenses
and
so
secure
some
kind
of
shelter
for
themselves
all
law
enforcement
below
the
level
of
capital
crimes
went
by
default
prisoners
were
tried
quickly
often
in
batches
rarely
acquitted
and
sentences
of
death
were
executed
before
nightfall
so
as
to
conserve
both
prison
space
and
rations
in
rural
life
the
descent
was
neither
so
fast
nor
so
far
there
was
no
gasoline
to
run
cars
or
tractors
but
carefully
husbanded
storagebatteries
still
provided
enough
electricity
to
catch
the
news
on
the
radio
or
allow
the
washingmachine
to
do
the
week
laundry
to
a
great
extent
the
farmer
gave
up
his
dependence
on
manufactured
goods

when
he
could
barter
his
surplus
eggs
or
milk
for
them
and
instead
went
back
to
the
practices
of
his
forefather
becoming
for
all
intents
and
purposes
practically
selfsufficient
soap
from
woodashes
and
leftover
kitchen
grease
might
scratch
his
skin
and
a
jacket
of
rabbit
or
wolverine
hide
make
him
selfconscious
but
he
went
neither
cold
nor
hungry
nor
dirty
while
his
urban
counterpart
for
the
most
part
did
one
contingency
the
countrydweller
prepared
grimly
against
roaming
hordes
of
the
hungry
from
the
towns
driven
to
plunder
by
starvation
which
they
were
too
shiftless
to
alleviate
by
purchasing
concentrates
for
sale
everywhere
shotguns
were
loaded
corncribs
made
tight
stock
zealously
guarded
but
except
rarely
the
danger
had
been
overestimated
the
undernourished
proletariat
lacked
the
initiative
to
go
out
where
the
food
came
from
generations
had
conditioned
them
to
an
instinctive
belief
that
bread
came
from
the
bakery
meat
from
the
butcher
butter
from
the
grocer
driven
by
desperation
they
broke
into
scantily
supplied
food
depots
but
seldom
ventured
beyond
the
familiar
pavements
famine
took
its
victims
in
the
streets
the
farmers
continued
to
eat
i
arrived
in
new
york
on
the
clipper
from
london
in
of
this
dreadful
winter
i
had
boarded
the
plane
at
croydon
only
subconsciously
aware
of
the
drive
from
london
through
the
traditionally
neat
hedgerows
of
the
completely
placid
and
lawabiding
england
around
me
the
pleasant
officials
the
helpful
yet
not
servile
porters
long
island
shocked
me
by
contrast
it
had
come
to
its
present
condition
by
slow
degrees
but
to
the
returning
traveler
the
collapse
was
so
woefully
abrupt
it
seemed
to
have
happened
overnight
tension
and
hysteria
made
everyone
volatile
the
customs
officials
careless
of
the
position
of
those
whom
they
dealt
with
either
inspected
every
cubic
inch
of
luggage
with
boorish
suspicion
and
resultant
damage
or
else
waved
the
proffered
handbags
airily
aside
with
false
geniality
the
highways
repeating
a
pattern
i
had
cause
to
know
so
well
were
nearly
impassable
with
brokendown
cars
and
other
litter
the
streets
of
queens
cluttered
with
wreckage
and
refuse
were
bounded
by
houses
in
a
state
of
apathetic
disrepair
whose
filthy
windows
refused
to
look
upon
the
scene
before
them
the
great
bridges
over
the
east
river
were
not
being
properly
maintained
as
an
occasional
snapped
cable
hanging
over
the
water
like
a
drunken
snake
showed
it
was
dangerous
to
cross
them
but
there
was
no
other
way
the
ferryboats
had
long
since
broken
down
at
the
door
of
my
hotel
where
i
had
long
been
accustomed
to
just
the
right
degree
of
courteous
attention
a
screaming
mob
of
men
and
boys
wrapped
in
careless
rags
to
keep
out
the
cold
their
unwashed
skins
showing
where
the
coverings
had
slipped
begged
abjectly
for
the
privilege
of
carrying
my
bags
the
carpet
in
the
lobby
was
wrinkled
and
soiled
and
in
the
great
chandeliers
half
the
bulbs
were
blackened
though
the
building
was
served
by
its
own
powerstation
the
elevators
no
longer
ran
and
the
hot
water
was
rationed
as
in
a
fifthrate
french
pension
the
coverlet
on
the
bed
was
far
from
fresh
the
window
was
dusty
and
there
was
but
one
towel
in
the
bathroom
i
was
glad
i
had
not
brought
my
man
along
for
him
to
sneer
silently
at
an
american
luxury
hotel
i
picked
up
the
telephone
but
it
was
dead
i
think
nothing
gave
me
the
feeling
that
civilization
as
we
knew
it
had
ended
so
much
as
the
blank
silence
coming
from
the
dull
black
earpiece
this
even
more
than
the
automobile
had
been
the
symbol
of
american
life
and
activity
the
essential
means
of
communication
which
had
promoted
every
business
deal
every
social
function
every
romance
it
had
been
the
first
palliation
of
the
sickbed
and
the
last
admission
of
the
mourner
without
telephones
we
were
not
even
in
the
horse
and
buggy
days
we
had
returned
to
the
oxcart
i
replaced
the
receiver
slowly
in
its
cradle
and
looked
at
it
a
long
minute
before
going
back
downstairs
i
had
come
home
on
a
quixotic
and
more
or
less
unbusinesslike
mission
it
had
long
been
the
belief
of
consolidated
pemmican
chemists
that
the
grass
might
possibly
furnish
raw
material
for
food
concentrates
and
we
had
come
to
modify
our
opinion
about
the
necessity
for
a
processing
plant
in
close
proximity
however
at
secondhand
no
practicable
formula
had
been
evolved
strict
laws
against
the
transportation
of
any
specimens
and
even
stricter
ones
barring
them
from
every
foreign
country
made
experiment
in
our
main
research
laboratories
infeasible
but
we
still
maintained
a
skeleton
staff
in
our
jacksonville
plant
and
i
had
come
to
arrange
the
collection
of
a
large
enough
sample
for
them
to
get
to
work
in
earnest
it
was
a
tricky
business
and
i
had
no
one
beside
myself
whom
i
could
trust
to
undertake
it
except
general
thario
and
he
was
fully
occupied
in
addition
to
being
illegal
it
also
promised
little
profit
for
while
dislocation
of
the
normal
foodsupply
made
the
united
states
our
main
market
for
concentrates
american
currency
had
fallen
so
low
the
franc
stood
at
the
pound
sterling
at
it
was
hardly
worthwhile
to
import
our
products
of
course
as
a
good
citizen
i
didnt
send
american
money
abroad
content
to
purchase
rembrandts
botticellis
titians
or
el
grecos
or
when
i
couldnt
find
masterpieces
holding
a
stable
price
on
the
world
market
to
change
my
dollars
into
some
of
the
gold
from
fort
knox
now
only
a
useless
bulk
of
heavy
metal
my
first
thought
was
miss
francis
though
she
had
more
or
less
dropped
from
public
sight
my
staff
had
ascertained
she
was
living
in
a
small
south
carolina
town
my
telegrams
remaining
unanswered
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
undertake
a
trip
there
despite
strict
instructions
my
planes
had
not
been
kept
in
proper
condition
and
i
had
great
difficulty
getting
mechanics
to
service
them
there
were
plenty
of
skilled
men
unemployed
and
though
they
were
not
eager
to
earn
dollars
they
were
willing
to
work
for
other
rewards
but
the
pervading
atmosphere
of
tension
and
anxiety
made
concentration
difficult
they
bungled
out
of
impatience
committed
stupidities
they
would
normally
be
incapable
of
they
quit
without
cause
flew
into
rages
at
the
machines
the
tools
their
fellows
fate
at
or
without
the
slightest
provocation
my
pilot
was
surly
and
hilarious
by
turn
and
i
suspected
him
of
drinking
which
didnt
add
to
my
confidence
in
our
safety
we
flew
low
over
railroadtracks
stretching
an
empty
length
to
the
horizon
over
smokeless
factorychimneys
airports
whose
runways
were
broken
and
whose
landinglights
were
dark
the
land
was
green
and
rich
the
industrial
life
imposed
upon
it
till
yesterday
had
vanished
leaving
behind
it
the
bleaching
skeleton
of
its
being
the
field
upon
which
we
came
down
seemed
in
slightly
better
repair
than
others
we
had
sighted
the
only
other
ship
was
an
antique
biplane
which
deserved
housing
in
a
museum
as
i
looked
around
the
deserted
landingstrip
a
tall
negro
emerged
leisurely
from
one
of
the
buildings
and
walked
toward
us
where
are
the
airport
officials
i
asked
rather
sharply
for
i
didnt
relish
being
greeted
by
a
janitor
i
am
the
chief
dispatcher
in
fact
i
am
the
entire
personnel
at
the
moment
my
pilot
standing
behind
me
broke
in
boy
where
the
white
folks
around
here
the
chief
dispatcher
looked
at
him
steadily
a
long
moment
before
answering
i
imagine
you
will
find
people
of
various
shades
all
over
town
including
those
allegedly
white
was
there
anyone
in
particular
you
were
interested
in
or
are
you
solely
concerned
with
pigmentation
why
you
goddam
i
thought
it
advisable
to
prevent
a
possible
altercation
i
recalled
le
ffaçasé
articles
on
the
black
south
which
i
had
considered
vastly
overdrawn
evidently
they
were
not
for
the
chocolatecolored
man
spoke
with
all
the
ease
and
assurance
of
unquestioned
authority
i
want
to
get
to
a
miss
francis
at
i
consulted
my
notes
and
gave
him
the
address
can
you
get
me
a
taxi
or
car
he
smiled
gravely
we
are
without
such
luxuries
at
present
i
regret
to
say
but
there
will
be
a
bus
along
in
about
twenty
minutes
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
i
suffered
the
wasted
time
and
inconvenience
of
public
transportation
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
i
resigned
myself
philosophically
i
walked
with
the
chief
dispatcher
into
the
airport
waitingroom
dull
with
the
listless
air
not
of
unoccupancy
but
disuse
not
much
air
travel
i
remarked
idly
yours
is
the
first
plane
in
a
month
i
wonder
you
bother
to
keep
the
airport
open
at
all
we
do
what
we
can
to
preserve
the
forms
of
civilization
the
substance
unfortunately
can
not
be
affected
by
transportation
production
distribution
education
or
any
other
such
niceties
i
smiled
inwardly
what
children
these
black
people
were
afterall
i
was
relieved
from
further
ramblings
by
the
arrival
of
the
bus
which
was
as
laughable
as
the
chief
dispatcher
philosophizing
the
dented
and
rusty
vehicle
had
been
disencumbered
of
its
motor
and
was
hitched
to
four
mules
who
seemed
less
than
enthusiastic
over
their
lot
i
got
in
and
seated
myself
gingerly
on
one
of
the
dilapidated
seats
noting
that
the
warning
signs
for
white
and
for
colored
had
been
smeared
over
with
just
enough
paint
to
make
the
intent
of
obliteration
clear
without
actually
doing
so
how
miss
francis
contrived
to
make
every
place
she
lived
in
apartment
chickenhouse
or
cottage
look
exactly
alike
was
remarkable
nothing
is
more
absurd
than
the
notion
that
socalled
intellectual
workers
are
always
alert
as
miss
francis
demonstrated
by
her
greeting
to
me
well
weener
what
is
it
this
time
selling
on
commission
or
an
interview
it
was
inconceivable
any
literate
person
in
the
united
states
could
be
ignorant
of
my
position
it
is
neither
i
returned
with
some
dignity
i
am
here
to
do
you
a
favor
to
help
you
in
your
work
and
i
explained
my
proposition
she
squatted
back
on
her
heels
and
gave
me
that
old
familiar
searching
look
so
you
have
made
a
good
thing
out
of
the
metamorphizer
afterall
she
said
irrelevantly
and
untruthfully
weener
you
are
a
consistent
character
a
beautifully
consistent
character
please
come
to
the
point
miss
francis
i
am
a
busy
man
and
i
have
come
down
here
simply
to
see
you
will
you
accept
no
no
i
doubt
if
i
could
combine
my
research
with
your
attempt
to
process
the
inoculated
however
that
would
not
prevent
me
from
taking
you
up
and
using
you
in
order
to
further
a
good
cause
but
i
am
not
yet
ready
i
shall
not
be
ready
for
some
time
to
go
directly
to
the
grass
that
must
come
later
no
weener
i
was
exasperated
at
the
softness
of
my
impulse
which
had
made
me
seek
out
this
madwoman
to
do
her
a
favor
i
could
not
regret
my
charitable
nature
but
i
mentally
resolved
to
be
more
discriminating
in
future
besides
the
thought
of
miss
francis
for
the
work
had
been
sheer
sentimentality
the
sort
of
false
reasoning
which
would
make
of
every
mother
an
obstetrician
or
every
hen
an
oologist
as
i
sauntered
through
the
drowsy
streets
killing
time
till
the
driver
of
the
ridiculous
bus
should
decide
to
guide
his
mules
back
to
the
airport
i
was
struck
by
the
lack
of
tension
of
apprehension
and
anxiety
so
apparent
in
new
york
evidently
the
black
south
suffered
little
from
the
brooding
fear
and
terror
i
put
it
down
to
their
childish
thoughtlessness
walking
thus
reflectively
head
down
i
looked
up
suddenly
straight
into
the
face
of
the
strange
lady
i
had
driven
from
los
angeles
to
yuma
i
sure
i
opened
my
mouth
but
no
words
came
out
she
was
hurrying
rapidly
along
paying
no
attention
either
to
me
or
to
her
surroundings
aloof
and
exquisite
i
think
i
put
out
my
hand
or
made
some
other
reflexive
gesture
to
stop
her
but
either
she
failed
to
notice
or
misunderstood
when
i
finally
recovered
myself
and
set
out
after
her
she
had
vanished
i
waited
for
the
bus
wondering
if
i
had
been
victim
of
an
hallucination
in
spite
of
miss
francis
blindness
to
her
own
interest
i
still
had
a
prospective
superintendent
for
the
gathering
and
shipping
of
the
grass
george
thario
unless
his
obsession
had
sent
him
down
into
mississippi
or
louisiana
i
expected
to
find
him
in
indianapolis
the
short
journey
west
was
tedious
and
uncomfortable
repeating
the
pattern
of
the
one
southward
at
the
end
of
it
there
was
no
garrulous
chief
dispatcher
for
the
airport
was
completely
deserted
and
i
was
thankful
for
an
ample
stock
of
gas
for
the
return
flight
i
had
no
difficulty
locating
joe
in
an
immense
highceilinged
furnishedroom
in
one
of
the
ugliest
gray
weatherboarded
houses
of
which
the
city
never
celebrated
for
its
architecture
could
boast
the
first
thing
to
impress
me
was
the
room
warmth
for
the
first
time
since
landing
i
did
not
shiver
a
woodfire
burned
in
an
open
grate
and
a
kerosene
heater
smelled
obstinately
in
an
opposite
corner
a
grandpiano
stood
in
front
of
the
long
narrow
windows
and
on
it
slouched
several
thick
piles
of
curlyedged
paper
he
greeted
me
with
something
resembling
affection
the
tycoon
himself
workers
of
the
world
resume
your
chains
a
w
it
a
pleasure
to
see
you
and
looking
so
smooth
and
ordinary
and
unharassed
too
at
the
moment
everyone
else
is
tearing
himself
with
panic
or
anguish
how
do
you
do
it
i
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
joe
i
answered
worry
never
helped
anybody
accomplish
anything
and
it
takes
fewer
muscles
to
smile
than
to
frown
you
hear
that
florence
i
had
not
noticed
her
when
i
came
in
the
original
of
the
snapshot
sitting
placidly
in
a
corner
darning
socks
i
must
say
the
photograph
had
done
her
less
than
justice
for
though
she
was
undoubtedly
commonlooking
and
sloppy
with
heavy
breasts
and
coarse
red
cheeks
and
unconcealedly
dyed
hair
there
was
yet
about
her
an
air
of
great
vitality
kindness
and
good
nature
parenthetically
she
acknowledged
my
presence
with
a
pleasant
smile
you
hear
that
remind
me
the
next
time
i
am
troubled
by
a
transposition
or
a
solopassage
that
it
takes
less
muscles
to
smile
than
to
frown
for
i
have
got
to
work
at
last
a
w
the
loafing
and
inviting
of
my
soul
is
past
my
soul
has
responded
to
my
invitation
you
remember
devilgrass
symphony
a
horrible
misconception
if
ever
there
was
one
a
personal
insult
to
anyone
who
ever
saw
the
grass
a
dull
unintentional
joke
bad
schoenberg
if
that
isnt
a
tautology
combined
with
faint
memories
of
the
most
vulgar
wagner
if
that
isnt
another
tautology
threaded
together
on
like
a
and
ragtime
but
what
am
i
saying
a
w
to
you
who
are
so
free
from
the
virus
of
culture
what
the
hell
interest
have
you
in
symphony
or
my
symphony
or
anybody
symphony
except
the
polyphony
of
profits
i
hope
no
one
thinks
i
a
narrowminded
man
joe
i
reproved
him
i
venture
to
say
i
have
as
much
interest
in
art
as
the
next
person
ive
done
a
bit
of
writing
myself
you
know
and
literature
oh
sure
i
didnt
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
you
did
not
but
while
i
believe
music
is
a
fine
thing
in
its
place
i
came
to
discuss
a
different
subject
if
you
mean
taking
joe
back
to
europe
with
you
youre
out
of
luck
mr
weener
put
in
florence
placidly
he
almost
finished
the
first
movement
and
we
never
leave
the
grass
till
it
all
done
you
mistake
me
mrs
thario
i
have
a
proposition
for
your
husband
but
far
from
taking
him
away
from
the
grass
it
will
bring
him
closer
to
it
impossible
exclaimed
joe
i
am
the
grass
and
the
grass
is
me
in
mystical
union
we
have
become
a
single
entity
i
speak
with
its
voice
and
in
the
great
cadences
which
come
from
its
heart
you
can
hear
thario
first
transfigured
and
magnified
a
hundred
thousand
times
i
was
sorry
to
note
his
speech
always
so
simple
and
unaffected
in
contrast
to
his
letters
was
infected
with
an
unbecoming
pomposity
looking
at
him
closely
i
saw
he
had
lost
weight
his
flesh
had
shrunk
closer
to
his
big
frame
and
the
lines
of
his
skull
stood
out
sharply
in
his
cheek
and
jaw
there
was
the
faintest
touch
of
gray
in
his
hair
and
his
fingers
played
nervously
with
the
ragged
and
illadvised
beard
on
his
chin
he
hardly
looked
the
man
who
had
evaded
serious
work
in
order
to
encourage
a
silly
obsession
comfortably
supported
all
the
while
by
a
sizable
remittance
from
his
father
i
outlined
to
them
my
plans
for
gathering
samples
of
the
weed
florence
tucked
her
stillthreaded
needle
between
her
teeth
and
inspected
the
current
pair
of
socks
critically
joe
walked
over
to
the
piano
and
struck
several
discordant
notes
i
understand
there
are
several
parties
making
expeditions
onto
the
grass
i
said
lots
confirmed
joe
there
a
group
sent
out
by
brother
paul
on
some
very
mysterious
mission
it
called
the
sanctification
of
the
forerunner
god
knows
how
many
thousands
he
made
his
suckers
cough
up
for
theyre
equipped
with
all
the
latest
gadgets
for
polar
exploration
skis
and
dogsleds
moompitcher
cameras
radios
and
unheardof
quantities
of
your
very
best
pemmican
they
started
as
soon
as
the
snow
was
thick
enough
to
bear
their
weight
and
if
we
have
an
untimely
thaw
theyll
go
to
join
the
russians
then
there
the
government
bunch
the
disruptions
commission
having
finally
and
reluctantly
produced
an
idea
but
exactly
what
it
is
they
havent
confided
to
an
eager
citizenry
smaller
groups
too
scientists
and
nearscientists
enthusiasts
who
have
got
the
notion
somehow
that
animals
or
migratory
game
are
roaming
the
snow
on
top
of
the
grass
exactly
how
they
got
there
is
not
explained
planning
to
photograph
hunt
or
trap
and
just
plain
folk
making
the
trip
for
the
hell
of
it
we
might
have
gone
ourselves
if
it
hadnt
been
for
the
symphony
your
symphony
is
concerned
with
the
grass
i
asked
politely
it
concerned
with
combinations
of
sound
he
looked
at
me
sharply
and
banged
out
harsher
discords
with
life
if
you
want
to
talk
like
a
programnote
if
you
go
on
this
expedition
it
will
give
you
an
opportunity
to
gather
new
material
i
pointed
out
if
i
look
out
the
window
or
consult
my
navel
or
while
at
stool
or
cut
my
finger
i
will
get
new
material
with
much
less
hardship
the
last
thing
a
composer
or
writer
or
painter
needs
is
material
it
is
from
excess
of
material
he
is
the
besotted
creature
he
is
he
may
lack
leisure
or
energy
or
ability
or
an
active
colon
but
no
masterpiece
ever
was
or
conceivably
could
be
thwarted
from
lack
of
material
yet
you
have
tied
yourself
to
the
grass
not
to
prostitute
it
to
whatever
talents
i
have
but
because
it
is
the
most
magnificent
thing
on
earth
then
of
course
youll
go
i
said
why
do
you
go
yourself
a
w
do
you
good
to
live
out
in
the
open
i
ca
afford
the
time
joe
i
have
too
many
things
that
need
my
personal
attention
he
struck
a
series
of
great
thumping
notes
and
so
have
i
a
w
so
have
i
afraid
youll
have
to
get
somebody
else
i
could
neither
understand
nor
shake
his
obstinacy
and
when
i
left
them
i
had
almost
determined
to
abandon
the
whole
project
for
i
could
not
think
whom
else
trustworthy
i
could
get
his
idea
of
my
own
participation
was
fantastic
i
had
long
since
come
to
the
point
where
it
was
necessary
to
delegate
all
such
duties
to
subordinates
perhaps
it
was
joe
sly
remark
about
it
doing
me
good
to
be
out
in
the
open
or
the
difficulty
of
getting
a
conveyance
but
i
decided
to
walk
to
my
hotel
taxis
of
course
disappeared
with
gasoline
but
ingenious
men
unwilling
to
be
pauperized
by
accepting
the
dole
had
devised
rickshaws
and
bicycle
carriages
which
were
the
only
means
of
local
transportation
the
night
was
clear
and
cold
the
stars
gleaming
in
distant
purity
but
all
around
the
offensive
smell
of
the
disheveled
city
played
on
my
disgusted
nostrils
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
amen
brother
are
you
saved
when
the
figure
had
come
out
from
the
shadow
of
a
building
to
accost
me
my
first
thought
had
been
of
a
holdup
but
the
odd
salutation
made
this
seem
unlikely
what
do
you
want
i
asked
brother
are
you
a
christian
man
i
resented
the
impertinence
and
started
to
walk
on
he
followed
close
beside
me
harden
not
your
heart
miserable
sinner
but
let
jesus
dissolve
your
pride
as
he
washes
away
your
other
sins
be
not
high
and
mighty
for
the
high
shall
be
low
and
the
mighty
powerless
in
a
short
time
you
will
be
food
for
grass
the
grass
is
food
for
the
ox
the
divine
ox
with
seven
horns
which
shall
come
upon
the
world
with
a
great
trumpeting
and
bellowing
soon
after
the
forerunner
i
knew
of
the
great
multiplication
of
insanity
and
hoped
i
could
reach
the
hotel
before
he
grew
violent
what
is
your
name
i
temporized
call
me
brother
paul
for
i
was
once
saul
the
worldly
now
i
am
your
brother
in
christ
brother
paul
the
radio
preacher
we
are
all
members
one
of
another
and
he
who
watches
the
sparrow
fall
makes
no
distinction
between
one
manmade
label
and
another
all
of
us
who
have
found
christ
jesus
with
the
help
of
brother
paul
are
called
brother
paul
come
to
the
loving
arms
o
miserable
sinner
and
be
brother
paul
also
i
thought
it
might
be
very
confusing
i
have
always
been
interested
in
religion
o
puny
man
interested
in
life
and
interested
in
death
interested
in
being
and
interested
in
begetting
interested
in
religion
and
interested
in
dung
turn
from
those
interests
which
the
devil
pays
upon
your
mortgage
your
savior
resides
in
the
heart
of
the
grass
withhold
not
your
precious
soul
from
him
at
this
very
moment
the
forerunner
is
being
sanctified
and
after
her
there
will
come
the
ox
to
eat
the
grass
and
then
the
end
of
the
world
give
brother
paul
your
worthless
earthly
possessions
give
your
soul
to
jesus
and
hasten
that
glorious
day
hallelujah
the
fervid
jumble
ended
in
a
near
scream
what
a
waste
of
oratorical
and
perhaps
organizational
energy
i
mused
as
i
strode
along
rapidly
still
intent
on
escaping
the
fanatic
under
different
circumstances
i
thought
a
man
like
this
might
turn
out
to
be
a
capable
clerk
or
minor
executive
suddenly
i
had
a
hunch
mr
brother
paul
i
have
no
earthly
name
i
wish
youd
come
with
me
for
a
few
minutes
i
have
a
proposition
which
might
interest
you
in
the
darkness
i
could
see
him
peering
at
me
suspiciously
is
this
some
worldly
seduction
from
the
christian
path
i
think
you
will
find
what
i
have
to
offer
a
material
aid
to
your
church
i
have
no
church
he
said
we
are
christians
and
recognize
no
manmade
institution
well
then
to
your
movement
or
whatever
you
call
it
in
spite
of
his
reluctance
which
was
now
as
great
as
mine
had
been
originally
i
persuaded
him
to
accompany
me
he
sat
uneasily
forward
while
i
told
him
who
i
was
and
sketched
the
plan
for
collecting
some
of
the
grass
what
is
this
to
me
i
have
long
ago
put
aside
all
material
thoughts
and
now
care
only
for
the
life
of
the
spirit
this
must
be
true
i
thought
noting
his
shabby
clothes
sweatgreasy
muffler
at
once
hiding
and
revealing
lack
of
necktie
and
cracked
shoes
one
sock
brown
the
other
black
it
is
this
to
you
if
you
do
want
the
salary
and
bonus
attached
to
organizing
and
superintending
the
expedition
and
i
am
prepared
to
be
generous
you
can
turn
it
over
to
brother
paul
i
imagine
it
will
be
acceptable
he
shook
his
head
muttering
satan
satan
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
wide
and
divided
horizontally
like
an
inverted
jellymold
it
tapered
up
into
bracketing
ears
supporting
gingery
eaves
i
pressed
home
my
arguments
i
will
put
your
proposition
to
brother
paul
he
conceded
at
length
i
thought
distinctions
between
one
man
and
another
were
worldly
and
trivial
i
prodded
him
arent
you
brother
paul
satan
satan
he
repeated
i
sure
it
could
have
been
nothing
but
one
of
those
flashes
of
intuition
for
which
successful
executives
are
noted
which
caused
me
to
pick
this
man
in
spite
of
his
absurd
ranting
and
illfavored
appearance
not
intuition
really
but
an
ability
to
evaluate
and
classify
personalities
instantly
i
always
had
this
faculty
it
helped
me
in
my
early
experiences
as
a
salesman
and
blossomed
out
when
i
entered
my
proper
field
anthony
preblesham
for
that
was
his
worldly
name
did
not
disappoint
my
judgment
for
he
proved
one
of
the
most
aggressive
men
i
ever
hired
the
brother
paul
hocuspocus
which
he
quickly
dropped
had
merely
caught
and
canalized
an
abounding
energy
that
would
otherwise
have
flowed
aimlessly
in
a
stagnant
world
in
consolidated
pemmican
he
found
his
true
faith
his
zeal
for
our
products
proved
as
great
if
not
greater
than
his
former
hysteria
for
the
salvation
of
mankind
it
was
no
fault
of
his
that
the
expedition
he
led
proved
fruitless
the
men
tony
preblesham
took
with
him
were
all
brother
pauls
who
since
they
disdained
them
had
not
been
told
of
material
rewards
but
given
the
impression
they
were
furthering
their
fanatical
creed
they
built
a
camp
upon
the
grass
or
rather
upon
the
snow
which
overlay
the
grass
near
what
had
once
been
springfield
illinois
digging
down
through
the
snow
to
the
weed
they
discovered
it
to
have
lost
most
of
its
rubbery
qualities
of
resistance
in
dormancy
and
cut
with
comparative
ease
more
than
four
tons
which
were
transported
with
the
greatest
difficulty
to
the
florida
plant
here
to
anticipate
their
work
came
to
nothing
for
no
practicable
method
was
found
for
reducing
the
grass
to
a
form
in
which
its
nutritive
elements
could
be
economically
extracted
the
secrecy
surrounding
the
government
expedition
could
not
be
maintained
and
it
was
soon
learned
that
what
was
planned
was
nothing
less
than
an
attempt
to
burn
great
areas
of
the
weed
while
in
its
dormant
state
all
previous
attempts
to
fire
the
grass
had
been
made
when
the
sap
was
running
and
it
was
thought
that
in
its
dryer
condition
some
measure
of
success
might
be
obtained
the
public
instantly
translated
possibility
into
probability
and
probability
into
virtual
certainty
their
enthusiastic
optimism
making
the
winter
more
bearable
the
party
proceeded
not
more
than
a
couple
of
miles
beyond
the
eastern
edge
dragging
with
them
a
flexible
pipeline
through
which
was
pumped
fueloil
now
priceless
in
the
freezing
cities
methodically
they
sprayed
a
square
mile
and
set
it
afire
feeding
the
flames
with
the
oil
the
burning
area
sank
neatly
through
the
snow
exposing
the
grass
beneath
dry
yellow
and
brittle
the
stiff
interwoven
stolons
caught
oil
was
applied
unstintedly
the
crackling
and
roaring
and
snapping
could
be
heard
by
those
well
beyond
the
perimeter
of
the
grass
and
the
terrific
heat
forced
the
temporary
abandonment
of
the
work
the
spotbroadcasters
in
emotional
voices
gave
the
news
to
those
whose
radios
still
functioned
reporters
flashed
their
editors
burning
successful
will
stop
grass
if
multiplied
all
over
the
country
volunteer
crews
were
instantly
formed
to
repeat
the
experiment
when
the
flames
died
down
the
men
crept
closer
to
inspect
the
results
the
heat
had
melted
the
snow
for
many
yards
outside
the
orbit
of
fire
revealing
a
border
of
dull
and
sodden
grass
beyond
this
border
a
blackened
crater
had
eaten
its
way
straight
down
to
the
reclaimed
earth
below
shouting
and
rejoicing
greeted
this
evidence
of
triumph
what
if
the
grass
could
advance
at
will
in
summer
it
could
be
subdued
in
winter
and
thus
kept
in
check
till
the
ingenuity
which
devised
this
one
victory
could
win
another
working
furiously
the
oil
was
again
sprayed
this
time
over
a
still
larger
piece
and
again
the
flames
lit
the
sky
the
president
issued
a
proclamation
of
thanksgiving
the
american
dollar
rose
to
to
the
pound
and
several
prominent
expatriates
began
to
think
seriously
of
returning
home
the
second
fire
burned
through
the
night
and
aided
by
a
slight
change
in
the
weather
thawed
the
snow
over
a
great
area
eagerly
the
expedition
now
swollen
into
a
small
army
returned
to
continue
their
triumphant
labors
the
bright
sun
shone
upon
the
dirtied
snow
upon
naked
muddy
earth
in
the
center
of
the
crater
upon
the
network
of
burnt
and
blackened
stems
and
upon
the
wide
band
of
grayishgreen
grass
the
retreating
snow
had
laid
open
to
its
rays
grayishgreen
but
changing
in
color
at
every
moment
as
the
work
of
spraying
began
again
changing
color
becoming
more
verdant
thrusting
blades
into
the
air
moving
its
long
runners
upward
and
sideways
and
downward
toward
the
destroyed
part
revived
by
the
heat
relieved
of
the
snow
the
grass
fighting
for
its
life
with
the
same
intensity
which
animated
its
attackers
burst
into
a
fury
of
growth
it
covered
the
evidences
of
destruction
in
less
time
than
the
burning
had
taken
it
tore
the
pipeline
from
its
tormentors
hands
and
drove
them
away
with
threats
of
swift
immolation
defiantly
it
rose
to
a
pinnacle
hiding
its
mutilation
and
flaunted
its
vivid
tendrils
to
bear
witness
to
its
invulnerability
till
a
killing
frost
followed
by
another
snowfall
covered
it
again
since
the
delusive
hope
had
been
so
high
the
disappointment
threw
the
public
into
a
despair
greater
than
ever
before
the
nervous
tension
of
anxiety
was
replaced
by
a
listlessness
of
resignation
and
the
suicide
rate
high
before
now
doubled
for
the
first
time
a
general
admission
was
to
be
heard
that
no
solution
would
be
found
and
in
another
season
the
end
would
come
for
the
united
states
facing
the
prospect
squarely
an
exodus
of
the
little
people
as
distinguished
from
the
earlier
flight
of
men
of
wealth
and
foresight
from
the
country
began
this
was
the
first
countermeasure
attempted
since
the
grass
crossed
the
mississippi
and
in
reaction
to
its
collapse
the
return
of
brother
paul
expedition
passed
almost
unnoticed
only

published

to

it

the
coming
of

was
awaited
with
grim
foreboding
but
the
grass
was
not
bound
by
any
manmade
almanac
and
unable
to
contain
itself
till
the
melting
of
the
snow
again
leaped
the
barrier
of
the
mississippi
this
time
near
natchez
and
ran
through
the
south
like
water
from
a
sloshed
dishpan
the
prized

of

black
legislatures
were
wiped
out
more
quickly

than

been

spread

only

opening
of
the

pussywillow
and

showing
of

northward
and

decent

the
content
of
this
summary
less
than
two
centuries
past
a
small
group
of
smugglers
merchants
and
planters
united
in
an
insurrection
which
in
its
course
gathered
to
itself
such
an
accreta
of
riffraff
debtors
convicts
adventurers
careerists
foreigners
theoreticians
idealists
revolutionaries
soldiers
of
fortune
and
restless
men
that
at
the
height
of
their
numbers
they
composed
with
their
sympathizers
perhaps
a
third
of
the
people
in
the
country
after
seven
years
of
inept
war
in
which
they
had
all
the
breaks
including
that
of
a
halfhearted

they
established
this

a

some
of
the

thrown

what
does
the

matter
if
the

product
was

for
all
to
see
is
it
not
fitting
that
a

calling

lightly
country
meaning
a
land
abundantly
favored
by

should
find
its
dispatch
through
an
act
of

become
understandably
irritable
this
is
not
to
pose
the
editorial
question
of
justice
but
to
remember
in
passing
the
girdled
forests
abused
prairies
gullied

the
stupidly
harnessed
plains
wasted
coal
gas
petroleum
the
millions
of

a

this
was
the
last

from
the
once
great

it
was
assumed
generally
that
he
had
perished
with
so
many
others
it
was
only
some
time
later
i
heard
a
curious
story
for
whose
authenticity
i
can
not
vouch
true
to
the
flippant
prediction
of
jacson

returned
to
the

into
which
he

he
went

taking
upon
himself
the
obligation
of
silence
though
an
old
man
he
stayed
close
to
the

giving
what
assistance
and
comfort
he
could
to

beside
the

to
me
but
i
mention
them
for
what
they
are
worth
when

came
again
the
canadian

petitioned
the

and
more
than
half

been
wiped
from

from

stretched
a

sea
of

been
thrust
from

weed
i
can
not
say
life
on
the
other
continents
and
i
could
call
any
of
them
except
possibly
africa
my
home
was
undisturbed
by
the
disappearance
of
the
united
states
american
competition
gone
the
tempo
of
businesslife
seemed
to
run
slower
and
slower
production
dwindled
prices
rose
luxury
articles
were
made
in
abundance
but
manufacturers
hesitated

russia
after
her
new
revolution
was
a
quiet
backwater
economically
although
politically
she
caused
turmoil
by
giving
a
home
to
the
fourth
international
germany
became
the
leading
iron
and
steel
country
but
it
was
not
an
aggressive
leadership
rather
it
was
a
lackadaisical
acceptance
of
a
fortuitous
role
while
britain
often
on
deathbed
but
never
a
corpse
without
question
took
the
lead
in
international
affairs
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
industries
was
now
if
not
the
largest
certainly
one
of
the
largest
companies
in
the
world
we
purchased
sheep
in
australia
beef
and
wheat
and
corn
in
south
america
rice
and
millet
and
eggs
in
asia
fruit
and
sugar
and
milo
in
africa
and
what
the
farmers
of
europe
could
spare
to
process
and
ship
back
in
palatable
concentrated
form
to
a
world
which
now
constituted
our
market
besides
all
this
we
had
of
course
our
auxiliary
concerns
many
of
which
dominated
their
respective
fields
ministers
of
finance
consulted
me
before
proposing
new
budgets
and
there
was
not
a
statesman
outside
the
socialist
union
who
didnt
listen
respectfully
to
my
suggestions
tony
preblesham
had
proved
an
invaluable
find
never
the
type
to
whom
authority
in
the
largest
matters
could
be
delegated
nevertheless
he
was
extremely
handy
as
troubleshooter
exploiter
of
new
territory
or
negotiator
with
competitors
or
troublesome
laborleaders
the
pioneers
who
had
fled
to
the
north
had
little
to
offer
in
payment
for
the
vast
quantities
of
food
concentrates
they
required
but
the
land
was
rich
in
furs
timber
and
other
resources
with
permission
of
the
danish
authorities
i
sent
preblesham
to
julianthaab
there
he
established
our
headquarters
for
greenland
iceland
and
all
that
was
left
of
north
america
from
julianthaab
immediately
radiated
a
network
of
posts
where
our
products
were
traded
for
whatever
the
refugees
could
bring
in
but
the
americans
who
had
gone
into
the
icy
wastes
were
not
seeking
subsistence
they
were
striving
mightily
to
reach
some
place
of
sanctuary
where
they
could
no
longer
be
menaced
by
the
grass
beyond
the
arctic
circle
here
they
might
learn
to
imitate
the
innuit
living
on
fish
and
seals
and
an
occasional
obligingly
beached
whale
but
could
they
be
sure
on
territory
contiguous
or
very
nearly
contiguous
to
that
supporting
the
weed
that
they
could
count
on
immunity
they
did
not
believe
so
they
filled
up
newfoundland
in
the
hope
that
the
narrow
gulf
of
st
lawrence
and
the
narrower
straits
of
belle
isle
might
offer
protective
barriers
they
crossed
on
sleds
to
baffin
island
and
in
homemade
boats
to
greenland
before
the
grass
had
wiped
out
their
families
and
their
less
hardy
compatriots
left
behind
in
nova
scotia
and
prince
edward
island
these
pioneers
abandoned
the
continent
of
their
origin
the
only
effect
of
their
passage
having
been
to
exterminate
the
last
of
the
innuit
by
the
propagation
of
the
manifold
diseases
they
had
brought
with
them
in
the
south
the
tempo
was
slower
the
striving
for
escape
less
hysterical
and
more
philosophic
when
the
mexican
peon
heard
the
grass
was
in
the
next
village
he
packed
his
few
belongings
and
moved
farther
away
from
tampico
to
chiapas
the
nation
journeyed
easily
south
not
regretting
too
loudly
the
lands
left
behind
not
crowding
or
jostling
rudely
on
the
highways
not
failing
to
pause
for
siestas
when
the
sun
was
hot
but
traveling
steadily
in
a
quiet
resignation
that
seemed
beyond
resignation
the
extension
of
a
gracious
will
but
the
rest
of
the
world
even
in
the
lethargy
which
had
come
upon
it
in
viewing
the
loss
of
most
of
north
america
could
not
afford
to
leave
the
grass
to
its
own
devices
content
to
receive
the
refugees
it
drove
out
or
watch
them
die
a
world
congress
to
combat
the
grass
was
hastily
called
in
london
it
was
a
distinguished
body
of
representatives
from
all
the
nations
and
resembled
at
its
best
the
now
functionless
federal
disruptions
committee
at
the
opening
sitting
a
delegation
with
credentials
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
attempted
to
join
in
the
proceedings
one
of
the
french
members
rose
to
inquire
of
the
chairman
where
was
the
united
states
he
the
delegate
had
read
of
such
a
country
had
heard
it
spoken
of
and
none
too
favorably
but
did
it
exist
the
delegate
from
haiti
asked
for
the
floor
and
wished
to
assure
his
distinguished
colleague
from
the
motherland
of
culture
especially
did
he
wish
to
assure
this
learned
gentleman
bound
as
they
were
by
the
same
beautiful
and
meticulous
language
that
his
country
had
good
reason
to
know
the
united
states
actually
existed
or
had
done
so
at
one
time
his
glorious
land
bore
scars
inflicted
by
the
barbarians
his
own
grandfather
a
great
patriot
had
been
hunted
down
by
the
united
states
marines
as
a
bandit
he
implored
a
congress
with
humanitarian
designs
to
refuse
admission
to
the
delegates
of
the
socalled
united
states
one
of
the
german
delegates
after
wiping
the
perspiration
from
the
three
folds
on
the
back
of
his
neck
said
he
spoke
with
great
diffidence
for
fear
of
being
misunderstood
the
formerly
existent
country
had
twice
defeated
or
apparently
defeated
his
own
in
a
war
and
his
distinguished
colleagues
might
misinterpret
the
spirit
which
moved
him
nevertheless
he
could
not
refrain
from
remarking
that
it
appeared
to
him
that
a
just
providence
had
wiped
out
the
united
states
and
therefore
it
would
be
illogical
if
not
blasphemous
for
this
august
body
to
admit
a
delegation
from
a
nonexistent
country
the
american
delegation
attempted
to
point
out
feebly
that
hawaii
still
remained
and
puerto
rico
and
guam
the
members
from
the
various
sections
of
the
british
commonwealth
arguing
the
precedents
of
the
governmentsinexile
urged
the
acceptance
of
their
credentials
the
representative
of
switzerland
called
for
a
vote
and
the
credentials
were
rejected
this
controversy
being
settled
the
body
in
high
good
humor
selected
a
governing
committee
to
take
whatever
measures
it
deemed
necessary
to
protect
the
rest
of
the
world
from
the
menace
after
lengthy
debate
and
much
conflicting
testimony
from
experts
a
bold
plan
was
endorsed
it
was
decided
to
complete
the
digging
of
the
nicaragua
canal
and
blow
up
that
part
of
central
america
lying
between
it
and
the
isthmus
of
panama
it
was
a
colossal
feat
of
engineering
which
would
cost
billions
of
pounds
and
untold
manpower
but
the
nations
of
the
world
not
without
some
grumbling
finally
agreed
to
the
expenditure
while
technicians
from
all
over
the
world
directed
laborgangs
and
steamshovels
ammunitionships
loaded
with
tons
of
explosives
sailed
from
every
port
for
panama
and
colon
though
at
first
reluctant
with
their
contributions
the
countries
had
reconsidered
and
poured
forth
their
shares
without
stint
all
obsolete
warmaterials
were
shipped
to
the
scene
of
action
prisons
were
emptied
to
supply
the
needed
manpower
and
when
this
measure
fell
short
all
without
visible
means
of
support
were
added
to
the
roll
shortsightedly
costa
rica
protested
vigorously
the
proposed
destruction
of
its
entire
territory
and
there
were
even
momentary
uprisings
of
patriots
who
proposed
to
defend
their
nation
with
the
last
drop
of
blood
but
commonsense
and
international
amity
prevailed
especially
when
costa
ricans
were
promised
a
territory
twice
as
big
as
their
native
country
in
the
hinterland
between
colombia
and
venezuela
a
valueless
tract
both
nations
had
been
trying
in
vain
to
settle
for
decades
night
and
day
the
detonations
of
highexplosives
killed
fish
on
both
the
atlantic
and
pacific
sides
of
central
america
and
brought
stunned
birds
plummeting
down
from
the
skies
to
their
death
the
coastal
plains
fell
into
the
sea
great
mountains
were
reduced
to
powder
and
little
by
little
the
gap
between
north
and
south
america
widened
but
the
progress
of
the
work
was
infinitesimal
compared
with
the
advance
of
the
grass
it
swept
over
the
ancient
aztec
empire
down
to
the
isthmus
of
tehuantepec
the
ruins
of
mayan
civilization
excavated
once
were
buried
anew
the
demolition
engineers
measured
their
daily
progress
in
feet
the
grass
in
miles
when
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
met
in
lake
nicaragua
the
grass
was
in
yucatan
when
the
first
green
runners
invaded
guatemala
a
bare
twenty
miles
of
northern
panama
had
been
demolished
and
hardly
a
start
had
been
made
in
the
destruction
of
costa
rica
fleets
of
airplanes
bombed
the
connecting
strip
in
the
area
left
by
engineers
to
the
last
but
as
their
flights
went
on
the
grass
crept
into
british
honduras
the
workers
sent
another
twenty
miles
of
panama
into
nothingness
and
the
grass
completed
the
conquest
of
guatemala
they
blew
up
another
ten
miles
and
the
grass
took
over
el
salvador
dynamite
widened
the
nicaragua
canal
to
a
ridiculously
thin
barrier
as
the
grass
overran
honduras
they
stood
now
almost
facetoface
the
width
of
one
pitiful
little
banana
republic
between
them
on
one
hand
the
grass
funneled
and
constricted
to
a
strip
of
land
absurdly
inadequate
to
support
its
gargantuan
might
on
the
other
the
combined
resources
of
man
desperately
determined
to
destroy
the
bridge
before
the
invader
in
tropic
heat
the
work
was
kept
up
at
superhuman
pace
gangs
of
native
laborers
fainting
under
their
loads
were
blown
skyhigh
by
impatient
technicians
unwilling
to
waste
the
time
necessary
to
revive
them
in
selfdefense
the
south
american
states
doubled
their
contributions
at
the
edge
of
the
weed
all
the
offensive
weapons
of
the
world
were
massed
to
stay
it
as
long
as
possible
for
even
a
day
even
an
hour
delay
might
be
invaluable
but
the
grass
overbore
the
heavy
artillery
the
flamethrowers
the
bombs
the
radium
and
all
the
devices
in
its
path
the
inventions
of
war
whose
constant
improvement
was
the
pride
of
the
human
race
offered
no
more
obstacle
to
the
grass
than
a
few
anthills
might
to
a
herd
of
stampeding
elephants
it
swept
down
to
the
edge
of
the
ditch
and
paused
at
the
fiftymile
stretch
of
saltwater
between
it
and
the
shapeless
island
still
offering
the
temptation
of
a
foothold
in
front
of
the
now
vastly
enlarged
panama
canal
if
those
engaged
in
the
task
from
down
to
the
sweating
waterboys
had
worked
like
madmen
before
they
worked
like
triple
madmen
now
for
the
wind
might
blow
a
single
seed
onto
what
had
been
costa
rica
and
undo
all
they
had
so
far
accomplished
the
explosions
were
continuous
rocking
the
diminishing
territory
with
ceaseless
earthquakes
after
an
hour
on
the
job
men
reeled
away
deafened
blinded
and
shocked
on
the
south
american
side
as
had
been
planned
great
supercyclone
fans
were
set
up
to
blow
back
any
errant
seed
fed
by
vast
hydroelectric
plants
in
the
colombian
highlands
the
noise
of
their
revolving
blades
drowned
out
the
sounds
of
the
explosions
for
all
those
nearby
the
oceans
became
interested
participants
and
enormously
high
tides
possibly
caused
by
the
difference
in
level
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
clawed
away
great
hunks
of
land
the
great
island
became
a
small
island
the
small
island
an
islet
at
last
nothing
but
ruffling
blue
water
lay
between
the
grass
and
south
america
over
this
stretch
of
sea
the
great
fans
blew
their
steady
breath
protecting
the
continent
behind
from
the
fate
of
its
northern
twin
the
passage
between
was
forbidden
to
all
ships
for
fear
they
might
inadvertently
act
as
carriers
of
the
seed
the
lost
continent
was
not
only
isolated
it
was
sealed
off
from
the
sharp
apex
of
the
inverted
triangle
to
its
broad
base
in
the
arctic
ice
the
grass
flourished
in
one
undisputed
prairie
the
sole
legatee
of
all
the
hopes
trials
afflictions
dreams
and
victories
of
the
men
and
women
who
had
lived
there
since
the
first
alien
foot
was
set
upon
its
soil
five
south
pacific
sailing
i
can
not
say
the
world
greeted
the
end
of
the
north
american
continent
with
either
rejoicing
or
regret
relief
yes
when
the
news
of
the
last
demolition
was
given
and
it
was
clear
the
grass
was
unable
to
bridge
the
gap
the
imaginative
could
almost
hear
mankind
emit
a
vast
sigh
the
world
was
saved
they
could
go
about
their
business
now
having
written
off
a
sixth
of
themselves
i
was
reminded
of
miss
francis
remark
that
if
you
cut
off
a
man
leg
you
bestow
upon
him
a
crippled
mentality
for
approximately
two
centuries
the
united
states
had
been
a
leg
of
the
global
body
a
limb
so
constantly
inflicted
with
growingpains
it
caused
the
other
parts
to
writhe
in
sympathy
now
the
member
was
cut
off
and
everyone
thought
that
with
the
troublesome
appendage
gone
life
would
be
pleasanter
and
simpler
debtor
nations
expanded
their
chests
when
they
remembered
uncle
shylock
was
no
more
industrial
countries
looked
eagerly
to
enlarge
their
markets
in
those
places
where
americans
formerly
sold
goods
small
states
whose
inhabitants
were
occasionally
addicted
to
carrying
off
tourists
and
holding
them
for
ransom
now
felt
they
could
dispense
with
those
foreign
undersecretaries
whose
sole
business
it
had
been
to
write
diplomatic
notes
of
apology
but
it
was
a
crippled
world
and
the
lost
leg
still
twitched
spectrally
i
do
think
i
speak
now
as
a
native
of
the
united
states
for
with
my
international
interests
i
believe
i
have
become
completely
a
cosmopolitan
but
for
everyone
englishman
italian
afrikander
or
citizen
of
liberia
the
disappearance
of
america
created
a
revolution
in
their
lives
a
change
perhaps
not
immediately
apparent
but
eventually
to
be
recognized
by
all
it
was
the
trivial
things
we
americans
had
taken
for
granted
as
part
of
our
daily
lives
and
taught
the
rest
of
the
world
to
appreciate
which
were
most
quickly
missed
the
substitution
of
english
turkish
egyptian
or
russian
cigarettes
for
good
old
camels
or
luckies
the
impossibility
of
buying
a
bottle
of
cocacola
at
any
price
the
disappearance
of
the
solacing
wad
of
chewinggum
the
pulsing
downbeat
of
a
hot
band
these
were
the
first
things
whose
loss
was
noticed
for
a
long
time
i
had
been
too
busy
to
attend
movingpictures
except
rarely
but
a
man
especially
a
man
with
much
on
his
mind
needs
relaxation
and
i
would
not
choose
the
foreign
movies
with
their
morbid
emphasis
on
problems
and
crime
and
sex
in
preference
to
the
cleancut
american
product
which
always
satisfied
the
nobler
feelings
by
showing
the
reward
of
the
honest
the
downfall
of
evildoers
and
the
purity
of
love
and
motherhood
art
is
all
very
well
but
need
it
be
sordid
as
i
told
george
thario
i
am
no
philistine
i
think
the
parthenon
and
the
taj
mahal
are
lovely
buildings
but
i
would
not
care
to
have
an
office
in
either
of
them
give
me
radio
city
i
do
mind
the
highbrow
programs
the
british
broadcasting
corporation
put
on
i
myself
am
quite
capable
of
understanding
and
enjoying
them
but
i
imagine
there
are
thousands
of
housewives
who
would
prefer
a
good
serial
to
bring
romance
into
their
lives
i
do
object
to
a
commercial
world
in
which
competitors
go
through
the
formality
of
pretending
to
be
scrupulously
fair
in
talking
about
each
others
products
but
i
must
admit
i
missed
the
good
old
american
slapdash
advertising
which
yelled
buy
my
deodorant
or
youll
stink
wash
your
mouth
with
my
antiseptic
or
youll
lose
your
job
brush
your
teeth
with
my
dentifrice
or
no
one
will
kiss
you
powder
your
face
with
my
leadarsenate
or
youll
keep
your
maidenhead
i
would
give
a
lot
of
money
to
hear
a
singing
commercial
once
more
or
watch
the
neon
lights
north
of
times
square
urge
me
to
buy
something
for
which
i
have
no
possible
use
living
within
your
income
is
fine
but
the
world
lacks
the
goods
youd
have
bought
on
the
installmentplan
getting
what
you
need
is
sound
policy
but
how
many
lives
were
lightened
by
the
young
men
working
their
way
through
college
or
the
fullerbrushman
i
think
there
was
a
subconscious
realization
of
this
which
came
gradually
to
the
top
in
the
beginning
the
almost
universal
opinion
was
that
the
loss
of
the
aching
limb
was
for
the
better
i
have
heard
socalled
cultured
foreigners
discuss
the
matter
in
my
presence
doubtless
unaware
i
was
an
american
no
more
tourists
they
gloated
to
stand
with
their
backs
to
the
temple
of
heaven
in
pekin
and
explain
the
superior
construction
of
the
masonic
hall
at
cedar
rapids
no
more
visitors
to
the
champagne
caves
at
rheims
to
inquire
where
they
could
get
a
shot
of
real
bourbon
no
more
music
lovers
at
salzburg
or
glyndebourne
to
regret
audibly
the
lack
of
a
peppy
swingtune
no
more
gourmets
in
vienna
demanding
thick
steaks
rare
and
smothered
in
onions
but
this
period
of
smug
selfcongratulation
was
soon
succeeded
by
a
strange
nostalgia
which
took
the
form
of
romanticizing
the
lost
land
american
books
were
reprinted
in
vast
quantities
in
the
englishspeaking
nations
and
translated
anew
in
other
countries
american
movies
were
revived
and
imitated
fashionable
speech
was
powdered
with
what
were
conceived
to
be
yankee
expressions
and
a
southern
drawl
was
assiduously
cultivated
bestselling
historical
novels
were
laid
in
the
united
states
and
popular
operas
were
written
about
daniel
boone
davy
crockett
and
kit
carson
men
told
their
growing
sons
to
work
hard
for
now
there
was
left
no
land
of
opportunity
to
which
they
could
emigrate
no
country
where
they
could
become
rich
overnight
with
little
effort
instead
of
fairytales
children
demanded
stories
of
fortyniners
and
the
wedding
of
the
rails
and
on
the
streets
of
bombay
and
cairo
urchins
probably
quite
unaware
of
the
memorial
gesture
could
be
heard
whistling
but
handinhand
with
this
newfound
romantic
love
went
a
completely
practical
attitude
toward
those
americans
still
existing
in
the
flesh
the
earliest
expatriates
being
generally
men
of
substance
were
well
received
the
thousands
who
had
crossed
by
small
boats
from
canada
to
greenland
and
from
greenland
to
iceland
to
europe
were
by
definition
in
a
different
category
and
found
the
quota
system
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
had
devised
used
to
deny
their
own
entrance
they
were
as
bewildered
and
hurt
as
children
that
any
nation
could
be
at
once
so
shortsighted
and
so
heartless
as
to
bar
homeless
wanderers
we
bring
you
knowledge
and
skills
and
our
own
need
they
said
in
effect
we
will
be
an
asset
to
your
country
if
you
admit
us
the
americans
could
not
understand
they
themselves
had
been
fair
to
all
and
only
kept
out
undesirable
immigrants
gradually
the
world
geared
itself
to
a
slower
tempo
the
gogetter
followed
the
brontosaurus
to
extinction
and
we
americans
with
the
foresight
to
carry
on
our
businesses
from
new
bases
profited
by
the
unamerican
backwardness
of
our
competitors
at
this
time
i
daresay
i
was
among
the
hundred
most
important
figures
of
the
world
in
the
marketing
and
packaging
of
our
original
products
i
had
been
forced
to
acquire
papermills
and
large
interests
in
aluminum
and
steel
from
there
the
progression
to
tinmines
and
rollingmills
to
coalfields
and
railroads
to
shippinglines
and
machineshops
was
not
far
consolidated
pemmican
once
the
center
of
my
business
existence
was
now
but
a
minor
point
on
its
periphery
i
expanded
horizontally
and
vertically
delighted
to
show
my
competitors
that
americans
even
when
deprived
of
america
were
not
robbed
of
the
traditional
american
enterprise
it
was
at
this
time
many
months
after
we
had
given
up
all
hope
of
hearing
from
joe
again
that
general
thario
received
a
longdelayed
package
from
his
son
it
contained
the
third
movement
of
the
symphony
and
a
covering
letter
dear
father
stuart
thario
general
i
shall
not
finish
this
letter
tonight
it
will
be
sent
with
as
much
of
the
first
symphony
as
makes
a
worthy
essence
when
it
goes
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
but
there
is
a
place
perhaps
not
in
life
but
somewhere
for
the
imperfect
for
the
incomplete
the
great
and
small
alike
achieve
fulfillment
satisfaction
must
this
be
a
ruthless
denial
of
all
between
i
have
always
despised
musicologists
makers
of
programnotes
little
men
who
tell
you
the
opening
chords
of
opus
describe
fate
knocking
at
the
door
or
the
call
of
the
yellowhammer
a
child
draws
a
picture
and
writes
on
it
is
a
donkey
and
when
grown
proves
it
to
be
a
selfportrait
by
translating
the
jupiter
symphony
into
words
having
said
this
let
me
stultify
myself
but
for
private
ears
alone
as
a
bit
of
personal
history
not
an
explanation
to
be
appended
to
the
score
i
started
out
to
express
in
terms
of
strings
and
winds
the
emotions
roused
in
me
by
the
sight
and
thoughts
of
the
grass
much
as
lvb
took
a
mistaken
idealization
of
his
youth
as
a
startingpoint
for
opus
but
just
as
no
man
is
an
island
so
no
theme
stands
alone
there
is
a
cord
binding
the
lesser
to
the
greater
a
mystic
union
between
all
things
the
grass
is
not
an
entity
but
an
aspect
i
thought
i
was
writing
about
my
country
conceived
of
myself
in
a
reversed
snobbishness
a
haughty
humility
a
proud
abasement
as
a
sort
of
superior
smetana
did
you
know
that
as
a
boy
i
dreamed
of
the
day
when
i
should
receive
my
commission
as
second
lieutenant
boston
massachusetts
i
interrupted
this
letter
to
sketch
some
of
the
middle
section
of
the
fourth
movement
and
i
have
wasted
a
precious
week
following
a
false
trail
and
of
course
the
thought
persists
that
it
may
not
have
been
a
false
trail
at
all
but
the
right
one
the
business
of
saying
something
is
a
perpetual
wrestle
with
doubts
we
leave
here
tomorrow
for
an
unknown
destination
portsmouth
probably
and
then
somewhere
in
maine
hoping
to
wrench
from
fate
the
time
to
finish
the
score
it
seems
more
than
a
little
pompous
to
continue
my
explanation
the
grass
the
united
states
humanity
god
whatever
we
write
about
we
write
about
the
same
things
still
there
is
a
limit
to
individual
perception
and
it
seems
to
me
my
concern
at
least
my
musical
concern
is
enclosed
by
canada
and
mexico
the
pacific
and
atlantic
so
rightly
or
wrongly
even
if
the
miracle
occur
and
i
do
finish
in
time
i
can
not
leave
a
short
distance
such
a
short
distance
from
where
i
scribble
these
words
vanzetti
died
no
more
childish
thought
than
atonement
was
ever
conceived
it
is
a
base
and
baseless
gratification
evil
is
not
recalled
so
i
do
not
sentence
myself
for
the
murder
of
vanzetti
or
for
my
manifold
crimes
who
am
i
to
pass
judgment
even
on
me
but
all
of
us
accusers
and
accused
condemners
and
condemned
will
remain
forever
indistinguishable
if
the
requiem
for
our
faults
and
our
virtues
if
the
celebration
of
our
past
and
the
prayer
for
our
resurrection
can
be
orchestrated
then
the
fourth
movement
will
be
finished
if
not
aroostook
maine
by
the
best
calculations
we
have
about
three
more
days
i
do
not
think
the
symphony
can
be
finished
but
the
thought
no
longer
disturbs
me
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
complete
it
just
as
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
sit
on
fleecy
clouds
and
enjoy
eternal
nevermelting
nevercloying
icecreamcones
celestially
flavored
the
man
who
is
to
carry
this
letter
waits
impatiently
i
must
finish
quickly
before
his
conviction
of
my
insanity
outweighs
the
promises
i
have
made
of
reward
from
you
and
causes
him
to
run
from
me
my
love
to
mama
the
siblings
and
yourself
and
kindly
regards
to
the
great
magnate
joe
about
the
same
time
i
also
received
a
letter
which
somehow
got
through
the
protective
screening
of
my
secretaries
albert
weener
savoy
hotel
thames
embankment
sir
you
may
recall
making
an
offer
i
considered
premature
it
is
now
no
longer
so
i
am
at
home
afternoons
from
until
at
little
bow
street
floor
rear
josephine
spencer
francis
in
spite
of
her
rudeness
at
our
last
meeting
my
good
nature
caused
me
to
send
a
cab
for
her
she
wore
the
identical
gray
suit
of
years
before
and
her
face
was
still
unlined
and
dubiously
clean
how
do
you
do
miss
francis
i
glad
to
find
you
among
the
lucky
ones
nowadays
if
we
do
hear
from
old
friends
we
automatically
assume
their
loss
she
looked
at
me
as
one
scans
an
acquaintance
whose
name
has
been
embarrassingly
forgotten
there
is
no
profit
for
you
in
this
politeness
weener
she
said
abruptly
i
am
here
to
beg
a
favor
anything
i
can
do
for
you
miss
francis
will
be
a
pleasure
i
assured
her
she
began
using
a
toothpick
but
it
was
not
the
oldfashioned
gold
one
just
an
ordinary
wooden
splinter
hum
you
remember
asking
me
to
superintend
gathering
specimens
of
circumstances
have
greatly
altered
since
then
i
answered
they
have
a
habit
of
doing
so
i
merely
mentioned
your
offer
because
you
coupled
it
with
a
chance
to
advance
my
own
research
as
an
inducement
i
am
on
the
way
to
develop
the
counteragent
but
to
advance
further
i
need
to
make
tests
upon
the
living
grass
itself
the
world
control
congress
has
refused
me
permission
to
use
specimens
i
have
no
private
means
of
evading
their
fiat
an
excellent
thing
the
decrees
of
the
congress
are
issued
for
the
protection
of
all
hypocrisy
as
well
as
unctuousness
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
you
have
a
hundred
hireling
chemists
all
of
them
with
a
string
of
degrees
at
your
service
i
want
to
borrow
two
of
them
and
be
landed
on
some
american
mountain
above
the
snowline
where
i
can
continue
to
work
besides
being
illegal
to
mention
such
a
thing
is
apparently
hypocritical
such
a
hazardous
and
absurd
venture
is
hardly
in
the
nature
of
a
business
proposition
miss
francis
philanthropic
then
i
have
given
fifty
thousand
pounds
to
set
up
nurseryschools
right
here
in
london
so
the
mothers
of
the
little
brats
will
be
free
to
work
in
your
factories
i
have
donated
ten
thousand
pounds
to
indian
famine
relief
so
that
you
might
cut
the
wages
of
your
hindu
workers
i
have
subscribed
five
thousand
pounds
for
sanitation
in
szechwan
thereby
lessening
absenteeism
from
sickness
among
your
coolies
i
will
not
stoop
to
answer
your
insinuations
i
said
i
merely
mentioned
my
gifts
to
show
that
my
charities
are
on
a
worldwide
scale
and
there
is
little
room
in
them
for
the
relief
of
individuals
do
you
think
i
come
to
you
for
a
personal
sinecure
i
do
ask
if
you
have
no
concern
outside
selfish
interest
for
the
answer
is
immediate
and
obvious
but
isnt
it
to
that
same
selfish
interest
to
protect
what
remains
of
the
world
if
the
other
continents
go
as
north
america
has
gone
will
you
alone
be
divinely
translated
to
some
extraterrestrial
sphere
and
if
so
will
you
take
your
wealth
and
power
with
you
i
am
supporting
three
laboratories
devoted
exclusively
to
antigraminous
research
and
anyway
the
rest
of
the
world
is
amply
protected
by
the
oceans
she
removed
the
toothpick
in
order
to
laugh
unpleasantly
once
a
salesman
always
a
salesman
weener
lie
to
yourself
deny
facts
brazen
it
out
the
world
was
safe
behind
the
saltband
too
in
the
days
when
josephine
francis
was
a
quack
and
charlatan
admitting
your
great
attainments
miss
francis
the
fact
remains
that
you
are
a
woman
and
the
adventure
you
propose
is
hardly
one
for
a
lady
to
undertake
weener
you
are
ineffable
i
not
a
lady
i
a
chemist
the
conversation
deadlocked
as
i
waited
for
her
to
go
oddly
enough
in
spite
of
her
sex
and
the
illegality
of
her
proposal
i
was
inclined
to
help
her
if
she
had
approached
me
in
a
reasonable
manner
and
not
with
the
uncouth
bearing
of
a
superior
toward
an
inferior
if
she
find
a
counteragent
i
thought
if
she
could
find
a
weapon
then
the
possibility
of
utilizing
the
grass
as
a
raw
material
for
food
concentrates
a
design
still
tantalizingly
just
beyond
the
reach
of
our
researchworkers
might
be
realized
labor
costs
would
be
cut
to
a
minimum
i
could
not
let
the
woman
be
her
own
worst
enemy
i
was
big
enough
to
overlook
her
unfortunate
attitudes
and
see
through
the
cranky
exterior
to
the
worthy
idealist
and
true
woman
beneath
i
was
interrupted
in
my
thoughts
by
miss
francis
speaking
again
north
american
landtitles
have
no
value
right
now
but
a
man
with
money
who
knew
ahead
of
time
the
grass
could
be
destroyed
how
clumsy
i
thought
trying
to
appeal
to
a
cupidity
i
do
possess
as
if
i
would
cheat
people
by
buying
up
their
very
homes
for
sordid
speculation
miss
francis
i
said
purely
out
of
generosity
and
in
remembrance
of
old
times
i
am
inclined
to
consider
helping
you
i
suppose
you
have
the
details
of
the
equipment
you
will
need
the
qualifications
of
your
assistants
and
a
rough
idea
of
what
mountain
you
might
prefer
as
a
location
of
course
and
she
began
rattling
off
a
catalogue
of
items
stabbing
the
air
with
her
toothpick
as
a
sort
of
running
punctuation
i
stopped
her
with
a
raised
hand
please
reduce
your
list
to
writing
and
leave
it
with
my
secretary
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
i
picked
up
the
phone
and
cabled
tony
preblesham
to
report
to
me
immediately
the
decision
to
send
him
with
miss
francis
had
been
instantaneous
but
had
i
thought
about
it
for
hours
no
happier
design
could
have
been
conceived
outside
of
general
thario
there
was
not
another
man
in
my
organization
i
could
trust
so
implicitly
the
expedition
required
double
no
triple
secrecy
and
preblesham
could
not
only
guard
against
any
ulterior
and
selfish
aims
miss
francis
might
entertain
to
say
nothing
of
the
erratic
or
purely
feminine
impulses
which
could
possibly
operate
to
the
disadvantage
of
all
concerned
but
take
the
opportunity
to
give
the
continent
a
general
survey
both
to
keep
in
view
the
utilization
of
the
weed
whether
or
not
it
could
be
conquered
and
whatever
possibilities
a
lay
observer
might
see
as
to
the
grass
perishing
of
itself
albert

western
australia
dear
sir
according
to
instructions
our
party
left
paramaribo
on
the
inst
for
medellin
giving
out
that
we
were
going
to
see
possible
tin
deposits
near
there
at
medellin
i
checked
with
our
men
was
told
that
work
gangs
with
the
stuff
needed
to
make
landing
fields
together
with
caches
of
gas
oil
enough
for
times
the
flying
required
had
been
dropped
both
at
mt
whitney
on
banks
island
i
tell
you
the
boys
down
there
are
on
their
toes
of
course
i
did
not
tell
them
this
but
gave
them
a
real
old
fashioned
pep
talk
told
them
if
they
really
made
good
they
might
be
moved
up
to
rio
or
copenhagen
or
may
be
even
london
every
thing
being
in
medellin
we
left
on
the
heading
at
first
south
to
fool
any
nosey
cops
then
straight
west
so
as
to
be
out
of
range
of
the
patrol
boats
it
was
quite
late
before
we
could
head
north
and
the
navigator
was
flying
by
instruments
so
it
was
not
until
dawn
that
we
saw
land
you
can
sneer
all
you
like
at
bro
paul
of
course
he
has
not
had
the
benefits
of
an
education
like
you
but
i
want
to
tell
you
that
when
i
looked
out
of
the
port
saw
nothing
but
green
grass
where
houses
trees
mtns
ought
to
have
been
i
remembered
that
i
was
a
backslider
sinful
man
however
this
is
beside
the
point
the
lady
professor
miss
francis
i
mean
white
black
were
both
so
excited
they
could
hardly
eat
but
kept
making
funny
remarks
in
some
foreign
language
which
i
do
not
understand
however
i
do
not
think
there
was
any
thing
wrong
or
disloyal
to
you
in
their
conversation
you
would
have
thought
that
flying
over
so
much
green
would
have
got
tiresome
after
some
time
but
you
would
have
been
wrong
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
describe
it
to
you
but
i
can
only
say
again
that
it
made
me
think
of
my
account
with
my
maker
while
i
think
of
it
altho
it
does
not
belong
here
in
paramaribo
i
had
to
fire
our
local
man
as
he
had
got
into
trouble
with
the
police
there
was
giving
cons
pem
a
bad
name
he
said
it
was
on
the
firm
account
but
i
told
him
you
did
not
approve
of
breaking
the
law
at
all
we
had
no
trouble
sighting
the
party
at
mt
whitney
i
want
to
tell
you
it
was
a
great
relief
to
get
rid
of
the
scientists
altho
they
are
no
doubt
all
right
in
their
way
some
of
the
work
gang
kicked
at
being
left
behind
altho
that
was
in
our
agreement
they
said
they
were
sick
of
the
snow
the
sight
of
the
grass
beyond
i
said
we
only
had
room
in
the
transport
for
the
banks
is
gang
anyway
they
would
have
company
now
i
promised
them
we
would
pick
them
up
on
our
next
trip
miss
francis
the
others
acted
like
crazy
they
kept
shaking
each
other
hands
saying
we
are
here
we
are
here
altho
any
body
but
a
nut
would
have
thought
saying
it
was
a
waste
of
time
as
even
a
small
child
could
have
seen
that
they
were
and
any
way
why
any
body
should
want
to
be
there
is
some
thing
beyond
me
we
took
off
from
whitney
on
the
flying
back
west
there
were
no
land
marks
but
the
navigator
told
me
when
we
were
over
the
site
of
i
have
to
report
that
the
grass
looked
no
different
in
this
area
where
it
is
the
oldest
then
we
flew
north
looking
for
the
gt
salt
lake
according
to
instructions
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
we
could
not
find
it
altho
we
flew
back
forth
for
some
time
searching
while
the
instruments
were
checked
the
lake
has
disappeared
in
the
grass
we
headed
north
by
finding
no
land
marks
except
a
few
peaks
above
the
snow
on
the
rocky
mtns
i
am
very
glad
to
say
that
the
gt
lakes
are
still
there
altho
much
smaller
erie
ontario
so
shrunk
i
might
have
missed
them
if
the
pilot
had
not
pointed
them
out
the
lawrence
river
is
of
course
gone
we
followed
the
line
of
the
big
canadian
lakes
but
except
for
depressions
which
may
be
swamps
in
the
latitudes
of
the
gt
bear
gt
slave
lakes
there
is
nothing
but
grass
we
stayed
over
night
at
banks
is
it
was
very
cold
miserable
but
we
were
happy
to
remember
that
there
was
no
grass
underneath
the
snow
below
us
next
morning
the
after
fueling
up
we
took
off
with
the
ground
crew
for
the
homeward
trip
stopping
at
whitney
every
thing
was
except
that
i
did
not
see
the
lady
professor
miss
francis
i
mean
as
white
and
black
said
she
was
too
busy
i
will
be
in
london
to
meet
you
on
the
as
arranged
give
you
any
further
news
you
want
until
then
i
remain
yrs
truly
preblesham
in
chge
of
field
operations
cons
pem
i
can
not
say
preblesham
report
was
particularly
enlightening
but
it
at
least
squelched
any
notion
the
grass
might
be
dying
of
itself
i
did
not
expect
any
great
results
from
the
scientists
expedition
but
i
felt
it
worth
a
gamble
in
the
meantime
i
dismissed
the
lost
continent
from
my
mind
and
turned
to
more
immediate
concerns
the
disappearance
of
american
foundries
and
the
withdrawal
of
the
russian
products
from
export
after
their
second
revolution
had
forced
a
boom
in
european
steel
english
french
and
german
manufacturers
of
automobiles
rails
and
locomotives
anticipating
tremendously
enlarged
outlets
for
their
output
even
if
those
new
markets
still
fell
short
of
the
demand
formerly
drawing
upon
the
american
factories
had
earmarked
the
entire
world
supply
for
a
long
time
to
come
since
i
owned
large
blocks
of
stock
not
only
in
the
industries
but
in
the
rollingmills
as
well
this
boom
was
profitable
to
me
i
had
long
since
passed
the
point
where
it
was
necessary
no
matter
how
great
my
expenses
or
philanthropies
for
me
to
exert
myself
further
but
as
i
have
always
felt
anyone
who
gains
wealth
without
effort
is
no
better
than
a
parasite
i
was
contracting
for
new
plants
in
bohemia
poland
northern
italy
and
france
i
did
not
neglect
buying
heavily
into
the
briey
basin
and
into
the
swedish
oremines
to
ensure
the
future
supply
of
these
mills
in
spite
of
the
able
assistance
of
stuart
thario
and
the
excellent
spadework
of
preblesham
i
was
so
busy
at
this
time
for
in
addition
to
everything
else
the
sale
of
concentrates
diagrammed
an
everascending
spiral
that
food
and
sleep
seemed
to
be
only
irritating
curtailments
of
the
workingday
it
was
the
fashion
when
i
was
a
youth
for
novelists
to
sneer
at
businessmen
and
proclaim
that
the
conduct
of
industry
was
a
simple
affair
such
as
any
halfwit
could
attend
to
with
but
a
portion
of
his
mind
i
wish
these
cynics
could
have
come
to
know
the
delicate
workings
and
balances
of
my
intricate
empire
we
in
responsible
positions
and
myself
most
of
all
were
on
a
constant
alert
ready
for
instant
decision
or
personal
attention
to
a
mass
of
new
detail
at
any
moment
on
one
of
the
occasions
when
i
had
to
fly
to
copenhagen
it
was
winifred
and
not
general
thario
who
met
me
at
the
airport
general
t
is
so
upset
she
explained
in
her
vivacious
way
that
i
had
to
come
instead
but
perhaps
i
should
have
sent
pauline
i
assured
her
i
was
pleased
to
see
her
and
hastened
to
express
concern
for
her
father
oh
it
not
him
at
all
really
she
said
it
mama
she
all
bothered
about
joe
i
lowered
my
voice
respectfully
and
said
i
was
sure
mrs
thario
was
overcome
with
grief
and
perhaps
i
had
better
not
intrude
at
such
a
time
poo
dissented
winifred
mama
doesnt
know
what
grief
is
she
simply
delighted
at
joe
doing
a
custer
but
she
awfully
bothered
about
his
music
in
what
way
i
asked
do
you
mean
getting
it
performed
getting
it
performed
nothing
getting
it
suppressed
that
a
long
line
of
generals
and
admirals
should
wind
up
in
a
composer
is
to
her
a
disgrace
which
will
need
a
great
deal
of
living
down
it
preys
on
her
mind
poor
old
stuart
is
home
now
reading
her
choice
passages
from
the
of
the
by
theodore
roosevelt
to
soothe
her
nerves
i
had
been
more
than
a
little
apprehensive
of
meeting
mama
again
but
winifred
report
seemed
to
reassure
me
that
she
would
be
confined
if
not
to
bed
at
least
to
her
own
apartments
i
was
sadly
disillusioned
to
find
her
ensconced
in
a
comfortable
armchair
beside
a
brightly
burning
fire
the
general
with
a
book
held
open
by
his
thumb
he
greeted
me
with
his
usual
affection
albert
i
sorry
i
wasnt
able
to
get
to
the
airport
i
shook
his
hand
and
turned
to
his
wife
i
regret
to
hear
you
are
indisposed
mrs
thario
spare
me
your
damned
crocodile
tears
where
is
my
son
in
his
last
letter
he
suggested
he
would
remain
in
our
country
as
long
as
it
existed
however
it
is
possible
even
probable
he
escaped
let
us
hope
so
mrs
thario
that
the
sort
of
damned
hogwash
you
feed
to
green
troops
not
to
veterans
my
son
is
dead
in
action
my
grandfather
went
the
same
way
at
chancellorsville
do
you
think
me
some
whimpering
broompusher
to
weep
at
the
loss
of
a
son
on
the
battlefield
stuart
thario
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
easy
bloodpressure
no
excitement
not
in
regimentals
said
mama
and
relapsed
into
silence
we
had
a
very
uneasy
dinner
during
which
we
were
unable
to
discuss
business
owing
to
the
presence
of
the
ladies
afterward
the
general
and
i
withdrew
with
our
coffee
he
did
not
drink
at
home
so
i
missed
the
clarity
which
always
accompanied
his
indulgence
and
were
deep
in
figures
and
calculations
when
winifred
summoned
us
hastily
general
mr
weener
come
quickly
mama
we
hurried
into
the
living
room
i
for
one
anticipating
mama
if
not
in
the
throes
of
a
stroke
at
least
in
a
faint
but
she
was
standing
upright
before
the
open
fire
an
unsheathed
cavalry
saber
in
her
hand
it
was
clearly
a
family
relic
for
from
its
guard
dangled
the
golden
tassel
of
the
united
states
army
and
on
its
naked
blade
were
little
spots
of
rust
but
it
looked
dangerous
enough
as
she
warned
us
off
with
a
sweep
of
it
in
her
other
hand
i
recognized
the
bulky
manuscript
of
george
first
symphony
which
she
was
burning
page
by
page
some
damned
impostor
she
said
some
damned
impostor
harriet
protested
the
general
harriet
please
the
boy
work
only
copy
she
fed
another
leaf
to
the
fire
impostor
harriet
he
advanced
toward
her
but
she
waved
him
away
with
the
sharp
blade
ca
burn
george
work
this
way
gave
his
life
i
had
not
thought
highly
of
joe
talents
as
a
musician
believing
them
byandlarge
to
be
but
reflections
of
his
unfortunate
affectations
i
think
i
can
say
i
appreciate
good
music
and
ive
often
taken
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
from
hearing
a
hotelband
play
rubinstein
melody
in
f
or
like
classical
numbers
during
mealtimes
but
even
if
joe
symphony
was
but
a
series
of
harsh
and
disjointed
sounds
i
thought
its
destruction
a
dreadful
thing
for
mama
to
do
and
the
more
shocking
aside
from
any
question
of
artistic
taste
because
of
its
reversal
of
all
we
associate
with
the
attitude
of
true
motherhood
mrs
thario
i
protested
as
your
son
friend
i
beg
you
to
consider
impudence
declared
mama
pointing
the
sword
at
me
so
that
i
involuntarily
backed
up
although
already
at
a
respectful
distance
damned
impudence
she
repeated
feeding
another
page
to
the
fire
came
into
my
house
bold
as
brass
and
said
if
you
please
ha
i
cream
him
i
will
and
she
made
a
violent
gesture
with
the
saber
as
though
skewering
me
upon
its
length
i
whispered
to
constance
who
was
standing
closest
that
her
mother
had
undoubtedly
lost
her
reason
and
should
be
forcibly
restrained
unhappily
the
old
lady
keen
ears
caught
my
suggestion
oho
am
i
i
spend
my
life
making
more
money
than
i
can
spend
do
i
i
push
my
way
against
all
decency
into
the
company
of
my
betters
boring
them
and
myself
for
no
earthly
reason
do
i
i
live
on
crackers
and
milk
because
ive
spent
my
nervous
energy
piling
up
the
means
to
buy
an
endless
supply
of
steaks
and
chops
my
doctor
forbids
me
to
eat
i
starve
my
employees
half
to
death
in
order
to
give
the
money
i
steal
from
them
to
some
charity
which
hands
a
small
part
of
it
back
ay
i
hire
lobbyists
or
bribe
officials
to
pass
laws
and
then
employ
others
to
break
them
i
foster
nationalist
organizations
with
one
hand
and
build
up
international
cartels
with
the
other
do
i
i
crazy
am
i
excited
by
her
own
rhetoric
she
put
several
pages
at
once
into
the
flames
constance
pleaded
mama
this
is
all
we
have
left
of
joe
please
mama
sundays
the
church
banner
is
raised
above
the
flag
i
never
heard
a
post
chaplain
say
immortality
was
contained
on
pieces
of
paper
comfort
then
mama
suggested
winifred
creative
work
muttered
the
general
is
it
some
trivial
thing
to
endure
the
pangs
of
childbed
that
the
creations
of
men
are
so
exalted
i
have
offered
my
life
on
a
battlefield
no
less
and
no
more
than
my
grandfather
fought
on
at
chancellorsville
little
minds
do
not
judge
but
i
judge
i
bore
a
son
he
was
my
extension
as
this
weapon
is
my
extension
she
thrust
the
sword
forward
to
emphasize
her
utterance
i
will
not
hesitate
to
judge
my
son
if
he
did
not
die
in
proper
uniform
at
least
i
shall
not
have
him
go
down
as
a
maker
of
piano
notes
instead
of
buglecalls
she
threw
the
balance
of
the
score
into
the
fire
and
stirred
it
into
a
blaze
with
the
steel
point
the
ringing
of
the
telephonebell
put
a
period
to
the
scene
constance
who
spoke
several
languages
answered
it
she
carried
on
an
incomprehensible
conversation
for
a
minute
and
then
motioned
to
me
with
her
head
it
for
you
mr
weener
rio
i
wait
till
they
get
the
connection
through
she
turned
to
the
mouthpiece
again
and
encouraged
the
operator
with
a
soothing
flow
of
words
i
was
vastly
relieved
at
the
interruption
it
was
undoubtedly
preblesham
calling
me
on
some
routine
matter
but
it
served
to
distract
attention
from
the
still
muttering
old
lady
and
give
her
a
chance
to
subside
preblesham
voice
came
in
a
bodiless
waver
over
the
miles
a
w
can
you
hear
me
i
can
give
you
a
tip
just
about
three
hours
ahead
of
the
radio
and
newspapers
can
you
understand
me
our
big
competitor
has
bought
the
adjoining
property
do
you
get
me
a
w
i
nodded
at
the
receiver
as
though
he
could
see
me
my
thoughts
racing
furiously
ahead
i
had
understood
him
all
right
the
grass
had
somehow
jumped
the
saltwater
gap
and
was
loose
upon
another
continent
i
had
about
three
hours
in
which
to
dispose
of
all
my
south
american
holdings
before
their
value
vanished
telephone
facilities
in
the
thario
house
though
adequate
for
the
transaction
of
the
daily
business
were
completely
unequal
to
the
emergency
even
if
they
had
not
been
mama
occasional
sallies
from
her
fireplace
fort
saber
waving
threateningly
frequently
endangered
half
our
communications
and
we
suffered
all
the
while
from
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
continental
operators
who
seem
unable
ever
to
make
a
clear
connection
varying
this
annoyance
by
a
habit
of
either
dropping
dead
or
visiting
the
nearest
café
at
those
crucial
moments
when
they
did
not
interrupt
a
tense
interchange
by
polite
inquiries
as
to
whether
msieu
had
been
connected
i
must
say
that
in
this
crisis
stuart
thario
displayed
all
his
soldierly
qualities
to
the
full
sweeping
aside
his
domestic
concerns
as
he
would
at
the
order
of
mobilization
he
became
swift
decisive
vigorous
the
first
call
he
put
through
was
to
the
kristian
iv
hotel
engaging
every
available
empty
room
so
that
we
might
preempt
as
much
of
the
switchboard
as
possible
pressing
constance
and
winifred
into
service
as
secretaries
until
his
own
officestaff
could
be
summoned
and
leaving
pauline
to
deal
with
mama
he
had
us
established
in
the
hotel
less
than
threequarters
of
an
hour
from
the
time
preblesham
phoned
even
as
the
earliest
calls
were
being
put
through
a
barely
perceptible
signal
passed
from
the
general
to
winifred
and
presently
large
parts
of
the
kristian
iv
bar
were
being
arranged
on
a
long
table
at
the
elbow
i
had
little
time
for
observation
since
i
had
to
exert
all
my
powers
of
salesmanship
on
unseen
financiers
to
persuade
them
by
indirection
that
i
was
facing
a
financial
crisis
and
they
had
a
chance
to
snap
up
my
south
american
holdings
at
fractions
of
their
values
but
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
admired
the
way
stuart
thario
continuously
sipped
from
his
constantly
refilled
glass
without
hesitating
in
his
duplicating
endeavors
i
expected
the
news
to
break
and
end
our
efforts
at
any
moment
but
the
quickness
with
which
i
had
seized
upon
preblesham
information
confirmed
the
proverb
about
the
early
bird
the
threehour
reprieve
stretched
to
five
and
by
the
time
havas
flashed
the
news
i
had
liquefied
almost
all
of
my
now
worthless
assets
and
to
potential
financial
rivals
needless
to
say
i
had
not
trusted
solely
to
the
honor
of
the
men
with
whom
i
had
conversed
but
had
the
sale
confirmed
in
each
case
by
an
agent
on
the
spot
who
accepted
a
check
draft
or
cash
from
the
buyer
only
on
paper
did
i
suffer
the
slightest
loss
in
actuality
my
position
became
three
times
as
strong
as
before
the
world
took
the
extension
of
the
grass
to
south
america
with
a
philosophic
calm
which
can
only
be
described
as
amazing
even
the
latins
themselves
seemed
more
concerned
with
how
the
grass
had
jumped
the
gap
than
with
the
impending
fate
of
their
continent
the
generally
accepted
theory
was
that
it
had
somehow
mysteriously
come
by
way
of
the
west
indies
although
as
yet
the
grass
had
not
appeared
on
any
of
those
islands
and
even
cuba
within
sight
of
the
submerged
florida
keys
was
apparently
safe
behind
her
protective
supercyclone
fans
but
the
fact
the
grass
had
appeared
first
at
medellin
in
colombia
rather
than
in
the
tiny
bit
of
panama
remaining
seemed
to
show
it
had
not
come
directly
from
the
daggerpointed
mass
poised
above
the
continent
of
buenos
aires
said
in
a
long
editorial
entitled
does
humanity
betray
itself
when
the
colossus
of
the
north
was
evilly
enchanted
many
americans
except
possibly
our
friends
across
the
river
plate
breathed
more
easily
now
it
would
seem
their
rejoicing
was
premature
and
the
doom
of
the
yankee
is
also
to
be
the
doom
of
our
older
civilization
how
did
this
verdant
disease
spread
from
one
continent
to
another
that
is
the
question
which
tortures
every
human
heart
from
the
antarctic
to
the
caribbean
it
is
believed
the
cordon
around
north
america
has
not
been
generally
respected
scientists
with
the
noblest
motives
and
adventurers
urged
on
by
the
basest
are
alike
believed
to
have
visited
the
forbidden
continent
it
may
well
be
that
on
one
of
these
trips
the
seeds
of
the
gigantic
were
brought
back
it
is
well
known
that
the
agents
of
a
certain
yankee
capitalist
have
been
accustomed
to
taking
off
on
mysterious
journeys
near
the
very
spot
now
afflicted
by
the
emerald
plague
it
was
a
dastardly
hint
and
the
sort
of
thing
i
had
long
come
to
look
upon
as
inseparable
from
my
position
of
all
peoples
the
latinamericans
have
long
been
known
as
the
most
notoriously
ungrateful
for
the
work
we
did
in
developing
their
countries
why
in
some
backward
parts
the
natives
had
been
content
to
live
by
hunting
and
fishing
till
we
furnished
them
with
employment
and
paid
them
enough
so
they
could
buy
salt
fish
and
canned
meats
fortunately
innuendo
so
obviously
inspired
by
envy
was
not
taken
up
and
attention
soon
turned
from
the
insoluble
problem
of
the
bridging
of
the
gap
to
the
southward
progress
of
the
weed
itself
from
the
very
first
everyone
took
for
granted
the
victory
of
the
grass
no
concerted
efforts
were
made
either
to
confine
or
to
destroy
it
the
world
congress
to
combat
the
grass
far
from
being
inactive
worked
heroically
but
it
got
little
cooperation
from
the
peoples
most
closely
affected
when
at
one
time
it
seemed
as
though
the
congress
had
got
hold
of
a
possible
weapon
the
venezuelans
refused
them
the
necessary
sites
and
brazil
would
not
allow
passage
of
foreign
soldiers
over
its
soil
nationalism
suddenly
became
rampant
we
will
die
as
ecuadorians
descendants
of
the
incas
exclaimed
the
leading
newspaper
of
quito
of
lima
pointed
out
caustically
that
most
of
ecuador
area
really
belonged
to
peru
and
the
peruvians
were
the
true
descendants
of
the
incas
anyway
we
shall
all
die
as
unashamed
peruvians
thundered
in
vain
the
church
pointed
out
the
difference
between
christian
resignation
and
sinful
suicide
the
reply
of
most
south
americans
when
they
bothered
to
reply
at
all
was
either
that
the
coming
of
the
grass
expressed
god
will
toward
them
or
else
to
scorn
the
church
entirely
imitations
of
brother
paul
movement
flourished
with
additions
and
refinements
suited
to
the
latin
temperament
so
the
efforts
of
the
world
congress
were
almost
entirely
limited
to
searching
each
ship
plane
and
individual
leaving
the
doomed
continent
to
be
sure
none
of
the
fatal
seeds
were
transported
even
this
precaution
was
resented
as
an
infringement
on
national
sovereignty
but
the
resentment
was
limited
to
bellicose
pronouncements
in
the
newspapers
the
republics
looked
on
sullenly
while
their
honor
was
systematically
violated
by
phlegmatic
inspectors
the
grass
grew
to
unheardof
heights
in
the
tropical
valley
of
the
amazon
it
washed
the
slopes
of
the
andes
as
it
had
the
cordilleras
and
the
rockies
leaving
only
the
highest
peaks
free
of
its
presence
it
raced
across
the
llanos
the
savannas
and
the
pampas
and
covered
the
high
plateaus
in
a
slow
relentless
growth
the
people
ran
from
the
grass
not
in
a
straight
line
from
north
to
south
but
by
indirection
seeking
first
the
seacoasts
and
then
escape
from
the
afflicted
land
those
north
americans
who
had
eluded
the
grass
once
did
not
satisfy
themselves
with
halfmeasures
when
their
sanctuary
was
lost
but
bought
passage
on
any
bottom
capable
however
dubiously
of
keeping
out
the
sea
and
embarked
for
the
farthest
regions
in
point
of
time
i
am
now
about
halfway
through
my
narrative
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
only
eleven
years
have
passed
since
the
grass
conquered
south
america
indeed
it
is
extraordinarily
difficult
for
me
to
reconstruct
these
middle
years
at
all
not
because
they
were
hard
or
unpleasant
on
the
contrary
they
carried
me
from
one
success
to
another
but
because
they
have
in
memory
the
dreamlike
quality
of
unreality
elusive
vague
and
tantalizing
like
a
dream
too
was
the
actual
progress
of
the
grass
we
were
all
i
think
impressed
by
the
sense
of
repetition
of
a
scene
enacted
over
and
over
again
it
was
this
quality
which
gives
my
story
now
that
i
look
back
upon
it
a
certain
distortion
for
no
one
hearing
it
for
the
first
time
and
not
as
any
reader
of
these
words
must
be
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
events
could
believe
in
the
efforts
made
to
combat
the
grass
these
efforts
existed
we
did
not
yield
without
struggles
we
fought
for
south
america
as
we
had
fought
for
north
america
but
it
was
a
nightmare
fight
our
endeavors
seem
retrospectively
those
of
the
paralyzed
the
grass
gripped
the
continent
great
northern
bulge
squeezed
it
into
submission
and
worked
its
way
southward
to
the
slender
tip
driving
the
inhabitants
before
it
duplicating
previous
acts
by
sending
an
influx
from
sparsely
to
thickly
settled
areas
creating
despair
terror
disruption
and
confusion
pestilence
hysteria
and
famine
the
drama
was
not
played
through
in
one
act
but
many
to
a
world
waiting
the
conclusion
it
dragged
on
through
interminable
months
and
years
offering
no
change
no
sudden
twists
of
fortune
no
elusive
hopes
at
last
mercifully
the
tragedy
ended
the
green
curtain
came
down
and
covered
the
continent
to
the
strait
of
magellan
the
grass
looked
wistfully
across
at
tierra
del
fuego
the
land
of
ice
and
fire
but
even
its
voracity
balked
momentarily
at
any
rate
at
the
inhospitable
island
and
left
it
to
whatever
refugees
chose
its
shores
as
a
slower
but
still
certain
death
south
america
finally
gone
the
rest
of
the
globe
breathed
easier
it
would
be
a
slander
on
humanity
to
say
there
was
actual
rejoicing
when
the
world
congress
sealed
off
this
continent
too
but
whatever
sorrow
was
felt
for
its
loss
was
balanced
by
the
feeling
that
at
long
last
the
peril
of
the
grass
was
finally
ended
no
longer
would
speculative
germans
thoughtful
chinese
or
wakeful
englishmen
wonder
if
the
supercyclone
fans
were
indeed
an
effective
barrier
no
longer
would
cubans
colombians
or
venezuelans
look
northward
apprehensively
oceanic
barriers
now
confined
the
peril
and
though
the
world
was
shrunken
and
hurt
it
was
yet
alive
more
it
was
free
from
fear
for
the
first
time
since
the
mutated
seeds
had
blown
over
the
saltband
i
must
not
give
the
impression
that
a
wiping
off
of
the
grass
from
the
accountbooks
of
humanity
was
universal
and
complete
the
world
congress
periodically
considered
proposals
for
countermeasures
on
the
top
of
mount
whitney
miss
francis
still
labored
new
assistants
were
flown
to
her
as
the
old
ones
wandered
down
the
great
rockslide
from
the
old
stone
weatherhouse
off
into
the
grass
during
fits
of
despondency
went
mad
from
the
realization
that
except
for
problematical
survivors
on
the
polar
caps
they
were
alone
in
an
abandoned
hemisphere
or
died
of
simple
homesickness
in
the
researchlaboratories
of
consolidated
pemmican
formulas
for
utilizing
the
grass
were
still
tinkered
with
and
the
death
of
almost
every
publicspirited
man
of
fortune
revealed
a
will
containing
bequests
to
aid
those
seeking
means
of
controlling
the
weed
it
is
not
afterall
a
detached
history
of
the
past
twentyone
years
i
am
writing
contemporaries
are
only
too
well
aware
of
the
facts
and
posterity
will
find
them
dehydrated
in
textbooks
i
started
out
to
tell
of
my
own
personal
part
in
the
coming
of
the
grass
not
to
take
an
olympian
and
aloof
view
of
the
passion
of
man
the
very
mention
of
a
personal
part
brings
to
mind
a
subject
which
might
be
painful
were
i
of
a
petty
nature
there
were
people
who
willfully
blind
to
the
facts
held
me
responsible
in
the
face
of
all
reason
for
the
grass
itself
although
it
is
difficult
to
believe
there
have
been
many
occasions
when
i
have
been
denounced
by
demagogues
and
my
blood
called
for
by
vicious
mobs
but
enough
of
morbid
retrospection
i
think
i
can
say
at
this
time
there
was
with
the
exception
of
certain
indian
nabobs
hardly
a
wealthy
man
left
in
the
world
who
did
not
owe
in
some
way
the
retention
of
his
riches
to
me
i
controlled
more
than
half
the
steel
industry
i
owned
outright
the
majority
stocks
of
the
world
oil
cartel
coal
iron
copper
tin
and
other
mines
either
belonged
directly
to
me
or
to
tributary
companies
in
which
i
held
large
interests
along
with
the
demagoguery
of
attributing
the
grass
to
albert
weener
there
was
the
agitation
for
socialism
and
the
expropriation
of
all
private
property
the
attempt
to
deprive
men
of
the
fruit
of
their
endeavor
and
reduce
everyone
to
a
regimented
miserable
level
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
i
spared
no
effort
to
combat
the
insidious
agents
of
the
fourth
international
fortunately
for
the
preservation
of
the
free
enterprise
system
i
had
tools
ready
to
hand
the
overrunning
of
the
united
states
wiped
out
the
gangs
which
operated
so
freely
there
but
remnants
made
their
escape
taking
with
them
to
the
older
continents
their
philosophy
of
life
and
property
gathering
native
recruits
they
began
following
the
familiar
patterns
and
would
in
time
no
doubt
have
divided
the
world
into
countless
minute
baronies
however
i
was
able
to
subsidize
and
reason
with
enough
of
their
leaders
to
persuade
them
that
their
livelihood
and
very
existence
rested
on
a
basis
of
private
property
and
that
their
great
danger
came
not
from
each
other
but
from
the
advocates
of
socialism
they
saw
the
point
and
though
they
did
not
cease
from
warring
on
each
other
or
mulcting
the
general
public
they
were
ruthless
in
exterminating
the
socialists
and
they
left
the
goods
and
adjuncts
of
consolidated
pemmican
and
allied
industries
scrupulously
unmolested
strange
as
it
sounds
it
was
not
my
part
in
protecting
the
world
from
the
philosophy
of
equality
nor
my
ramified
properties
which
gave
me
my
unique
position
unbelievably
because
the
change
had
occurred
so
gradually
industry
though
still
a
vital
factor
no
longer
played
the
dominant
role
in
the
world
but
had
given
the
position
back
to
an
earlier
occupant
food
was
once
more
paramount
in
global
economy
loss
of
the
americas
had
cut
the
supply
in
half
without
reducing
the
population
correspondingly
the
socialist
union
remained
selfsufficient
and
uninterested
while
australia
new
zealand
and
the
cultivated
portions
of
africa
strove
to
feed
the
millions
of
europeans
and
asiatics
whose
lands
could
not
grow
enough
for
their
own
use
the
slightest
falling
off
of
the
harvest
produced
famine
at
this
point
consolidated
pemmican
practically
took
over
the
entire
business
of
agriculture
utilizing
byproducts
and
crops
otherwise
not
worth
gathering
waste
materials
and
growths
inedible
without
processing
with
plants
strung
out
all
over
the
four
continents
and
with
tremendously
reduced
shipping
costs
because
of
the
small
compass
in
which
so
much
food
could
be
contained
we
were
able
to
let
our
customers
earn
their
daily
concentrates
by
gathering
the
raw
materials
which
went
into
them
i
was
not
only
the
wealthiest
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
but
its
savior
and
providence
as
well
with
the
new
feeling
of
security
bathing
the
world
tension
dissolved
into
somnolence
and
the
tempo
of
daily
life
slackened
until
it
scarcely
seemed
to
move
at
all
the
waves
of
anxiety
suspicion
and
distrust
of
an
earlier
decade
calmed
into
peaceful
ripples
hardly
noticeable
in
a
pondlike
existence
no
longer
beset
by
thoughts
or
fears
of
wars
nations
relaxed
their
pride
armies
were
reduced
to
little
more
than
palaceguards
brassbands
and
parade
units
while
navies
were
kept
up
if
periodic
painting
and
retaining
in
commission
a
few
obsolete
cruisers
and
destroyers
be
so
termed
only
to
patrol
the
atlantic
and
pacific
shores
of
the
lost
hemisphere
the
struggle
for
existence
almost
disappeared
the
wagescales
set
by
consolidated
pemmican
were
enough
to
sustain
life
and
in
a
world
of
limited
horizons
men
became
content
with
that
the
bickering
characteristic
of
industrial
dispute
vanished
along
with
it
went
the
outmoded
weapon
of
the
tradesunion
it
was
a
halcyon
world
and
if
as
cranks
complained
illiteracy
increased
rapidly
it
could
only
be
because
with
everyman
livelihood
assured
his
natural
indolence
took
the
upper
hand
and
he
not
only
lost
refinements
superficially
acquired
but
was
uninterested
in
teaching
them
to
his
children
i
do
know
how
i
can
express
the
golden
sunlit
quality
of
this
period
it
was
not
an
heroic
age
no
great
deeds
were
performed
no
conflicts
resolved
no
fundamentshaking
ideas
broached
quiet
peace
content
these
were
the
keywords
of
the
era
preoccupation
with
politics
and
panaceas
gave
place
to
healthier
interests
sports
and
pageants
and
giant
fairs
men
became
satisfied
with
their
lot
and
if
they
to
a
great
extent
discarded
speculation
and
disquieting
philosophies
they
found
a
useful
substitute
in
quiet
meditation
until
now
i
had
never
had
the
time
to
live
in
a
manner
befitting
my
station
but
with
my
affairs
running
so
smoothly
that
even
stuart
thario
and
tony
preblesham
found
idle
time
i
began
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
easier
side
of
life
of
course
i
never
considered
making
my
permanent
home
anywhere
but
in
england
for
all
its
parochialism
and
oddities
it
was
the
nearest
i
could
come
to
approximating
my
own
country
i
bought
a
gentleman
park
in
hampshire
and
had
the
outmoded
house
torn
down
it
had
been
built
in
elizabethan
times
and
was
cold
drafty
and
uncomfortable
with
not
one
modern
convenience
for
a
time
i
considered
preserving
it
intact
as
a
sort
of
museumpiece
and
building
another
home
for
myself
on
the
grounds
but
when
i
was
assured
by
experts
that
tudor
architecture
was
not
considered
to
be
of
surpassing
merit
and
i
could
find
in
addition
no
other
advantageous
site
i
ordered
its
removal
i
called
in
the
best
architects
for
consultation
but
my
own
artistic
and
practical
sense
as
they
themselves
were
quick
to
acknowledge
furnished
the
basis
for
the
beautiful
mansion
i
put
up
moved
by
nostalgic
memories
of
my
lost
southland
i
built
a
great
and
ample
bungalow
of
some
sixty
rooms
stucco
topped
with
asbestos
tile
since
the
spanish
motif
natural
to
this
form
would
have
been
out
of
place
in
england
and
therefore
in
bad
taste
i
had
timbers
set
in
the
stucco
although
of
course
they
performed
no
function
but
that
of
decoration
the
supports
being
framework
which
was
not
visible
it
was
delightful
and
satisfying
to
come
into
the
spacious
and
cozy
livingroom
filled
with
overstuffed
easychairs
and
comfortable
couches
warmed
by
the
most
efficient
of
centralheating
systems
or
to
use
one
of
the
perfectly
appointed
bathrooms
whose
every
fixture
was
the
best
money
could
buy
and
recall
the
dank
stone
floors
and
walls
leading
up
to
a
mammoth
and
from
a
thermal
point
of
view
perfectly
useless
fireplace
flanked
by
the
coatsofarms
of
deadandgone
gentry
who
were
content
to
shuffle
out
on
inclement
mornings
to
answer
nature
calls
in
chilly
outhouses
so
large
and
commodious
an
establishment
required
an
enormous
staff
of
servants
which
in
turn
called
for
a
housekeeper
and
a
steward
to
supervise
their
activities
for
as
i
have
observed
many
times
the
farther
down
one
goes
on
the
wagescale
the
more
it
is
necessary
to
hire
a
highsalaried
executive
to
see
that
the
wage
is
earned
i
can
not
say
in
general
that
i
ever
learned
to
distinguish
between
one
retainer
and
another
except
of
course
my
personal
manservant
and
burlet
the
headbutler
whom
i
hired
right
from
under
the
nose
of
the
marquis
of
arpers
his
lordship
being
unable
to
match
my
offer
but
in
spite
of
the
confusion
caused
by
such
a
multiplicity
of
menials
i
one
day
noticed
an
undergardener
whose
face
was
tantalizingly
familiar
he
touched
his
cap
respectfully
as
i
approached
but
i
had
the
curious
feeling
that
it
was
a
taught
gesture
and
not
one
which
came
naturally
to
him
have
you
been
here
long
my
good
man
i
asked
still
trying
to
place
him
no
sir
he
answered
about
two
weeks
funny
i
almost
certain
ive
noticed
you
before
he
shook
his
head
and
made
a
tentative
gesture
with
the
hoe
or
rake
or
whatever
the
tool
was
in
his
hand
as
though
he
would
now
with
my
permission
resume
his
labors
what
is
your
name
i
inquired
not
believing
it
would
jog
my
memory
but
out
of
a
natural
politeness
toward
inferiors
who
always
feel
flattered
by
such
attention
dinkman
he
muttered
adam
dinkman
that
incredibly
dilapidated
frontlawn
overrun
with
sickly
devilgrass
and
spotted
with
bald
patches
mrs
dinkman
mean
bargaining
with
a
tired
man
who
was
doing
no
more
than
trying
to
make
a
living
and
her
later
domineering
harshness
toward
someone
who
was
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
misfortune
which
overcame
her
i
wondered
if
she
were
still
alive
or
had
lost
her
life
in
the
grass
while
an
indigent
on
public
charity
it
is
indeed
a
small
world
i
thought
and
how
far
we
have
both
come
since
i
humbled
myself
in
order
to
put
food
in
my
stomach
and
keep
a
roof
over
my
head
thank
you
dinkman
i
said
turning
away
a
warm
feeling
for
a
fellow
american
caused
me
to
call
in
my
steward
and
bid
him
give
dinkman
a
small
fortune
to
an
undergardener
and
let
him
go
though
he
might
not
realize
it
immediately
i
was
doing
him
a
tremendous
favor
for
an
american
with
in
england
was
bound
to
do
better
for
himself
in
some
small
business
than
he
could
hope
to
do
as
a
mere
servant
looking
back
upon
this
too
brief
time
of
tranquillity
and
satisfaction
i
can
not
help
but
sigh
for
its
passing
preceded
and
followed
by
periods
of
turbulence
and
stress
it
stands
out
in
my
life
as
an
incredible
moment
a
soothing
dream
perhaps
a
faint
defect
so
small
as
to
be
almost
unnoticed
was
a
feeling
of
solitariness
an
inevitable
concomitant
of
my
position
but
this
was
so
slight
that
i
could
not
even
define
it
as
loneliness
and
like
many
another
defect
it
merely
heightened
the
charm
of
the
whole
i
had
wealth
power
the
respect
of
the
world
the
unavoidable
detachment
from
the
mob
was
mitigated
by
simple
pleasures
my
estate
was
a
constant
delight
the
quaint
survivals
of
feudalism
among
the
tenantry
amused
me
and
though
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
pretend
an
interest
in
the
absurd
affectation
of
foxhunting
i
was
well
received
by
the
county
people
whose
insularity
and
aloofness
i
found
greatly
exaggerated
perhaps
by
outsiders
not
as
cosmopolitan
as
myself
excursions
to
london
and
other
cities
where
my
presence
was
demanded
or
could
be
helpful
afforded
me
a
frequent
change
of
scene
and
visits
by
important
people
as
well
as
more
intimate
ones
by
preblesham
and
the
tharios
prevented
the
ivies
for
so
my
place
was
called
from
ever
becoming
dull
to
me
the
general
fell
in
love
with
a
certain
ale
which
was
brewed
on
the
premises
and
declared
in
spite
of
his
lifelong
rule
to
the
contrary
that
it
could
be
mixed
with
irish
whisky
to
make
a
drink
so
agreeable
that
no
sane
man
would
want
a
better
the
girls
particularly
winifred
were
enchanted
with
my
private
woods
the
gardens
and
the
deerpark
but
mama
throughout
their
visits
remained
almost
entirely
silent
and
aloof
except
for
the
rare
remarks
which
seemed
to
burst
from
her
as
though
by
an
inescapable
inward
compulsion
these
were
always
insulting
and
always
directed
at
me
but
i
overlooked
them
knowing
her
to
be
deranged
perhaps
one
of
the
things
i
most
enjoyed
about
the
ivies
was
wandering
through
its
acres
breathing
through
my
pores
as
it
were
the
sense
of
possession
i
was
walking
through
the
cowslips
and
violets
punctuating
the
meadow
bordering
one
of
the
many
little
streams
when
i
came
upon
a
fellow
roughly
dressed
the
pockets
of
his
shootingjacket
bulging
and
a
fishingline
in
his
hand
for
a
moment
i
thought
him
one
of
the
gamekeepers
and
nodded
but
his
quick
look
and
furtive
gestures
instantly
revealed
him
as
a
poacher
youre
trespassing
you
know
i
said
with
some
severity
i
know
guvner
he
admitted
readily
but
i
wasnt
doing
no
harm
just
looking
at
this
bit
of
water
here
and
listening
to
the
birds
with
a
fishingline
in
your
hands
well
now
guvner
that
by
way
of
being
a
precaution
you
see
when
i
go
out
on
a
little
expedition
like
this
to
inspect
the
beauties
of
nature
which
i
admit
i
have
no
right
to
do
they
being
on
someone
else
land
i
always
say
to
myself
you
run
into
some
gent
looking
at
a
lovely
fat
trout
in
a
brook
and
he
hasnt
got
no
fishline
with
him
what
could
be
more
philanthropic
than
i
produce
my
bit
of
string
and
help
him
out
aint
that
a
proper
christian
attitude
guvner
possibly
but
what
may
i
ask
makes
your
pockets
bulge
so
suspiciously
is
that
another
philanthropy
accident
guvner
sheer
accident
walking
along
like
this
with
my
head
down
i
always
seem
to
come
upon
two
or
three
dead
hares
or
now
and
then
a
partridge
or
grouse
natural
mortality
you
understand
well
what
could
be
more
humane
than
to
stuff
them
in
my
pockets
and
take
them
home
for
proper
burial
you
know
in
spite
of
all
the
labour
governments
and
strange
doings
in
parliament
there
are
still
pretty
strict
laws
against
poaching
poaching
guvner
i
wouldnt
poach
i
respect
what
yours
just
as
i
respect
what
my
own
trespassing
maybe
i
likes
to
look
at
a
little
bit
of
sky
or
hear
a
meadowlark
or
smell
a
flower
or
two
but
poaching
really
guvner
you
hadnt
ought
to
take
away
a
character
i
thought
it
a
shame
so
sturdy
and
amusing
a
fellow
should
have
to
eke
out
his
living
so
precariously
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
said
i
give
you
a
note
right
now
to
my
head
gamekeeper
and
have
him
put
you
on
as
an
assistant
thirty
shillings
a
week
i
think
it
pays
well
now
thank
you
guvner
but
really
i
do
want
it
thirty
bob
a
week
what
should
i
do
with
it
nothing
but
go
down
to
the
holly
tree
and
get
drunk
every
night
i
much
better
off
as
i
am
total
abstinence
in
a
manner
of
speaking
no
no
guvner
i
appreciate
your
big
heart
but
i
happy
with
my
little
bit
of
fish
and
a
rabbit
in
the
pot
why
should
i
set
up
to
be
an
honest
workingman
and
get
dissatisfied
with
my
life
his
refusal
of
my
wellintentioned
offer
did
not
irk
me
in
a
large
and
tolerant
view
you
could
almost
say
we
were
both
parasites
upon
the
ivies
and
it
would
not
hurt
me
if
he
stole
a
little
of
my
game
to
keep
himself
alive
i
gave
him
a
note
to
protect
him
against
any
of
the
keepers
who
might
come
upon
him
as
i
had
and
we
parted
with
mutual
liking
i
remembering
for
my
part
that
i
was
an
american
and
all
men
poacher
and
landlord
alike
were
created
equal
no
matter
how
far
each
had
come
from
his
beginnings
shortly
after
miss
francis
ended
her
long
sojourn
at
mount
whitney
and
returned
to
england
the
ordeal
of
living
surrounded
by
the
grass
which
had
destroyed
her
assistants
seemed
to
have
made
no
other
change
in
her
than
the
fading
of
her
hair
which
was
now
completely
white
and
a
loss
of
weight
giving
her
a
deceptive
appearance
of
fragility
at
variance
with
the
forthrightness
of
her
manner
i
put
down
her
immunity
to
agoraphobia
as
just
another
evidence
that
she
was
already
mad
her
refusal
to
accept
the
limitations
of
her
sex
and
her
complete
indifference
to
our
respective
stations
were
mere
confirmations
with
her
usual
disregard
of
realities
she
assumed
i
would
go
on
financing
her
indefinitely
in
spite
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
i
had
paid
out
without
visible
result
ive
really
got
it
now
weener
she
assured
me
in
a
tone
hardly
befitting
a
suppliant
for
funds
in
spite
of
the
incompetents
you
kept
sending
in
spite
of
mistakes
and
blind
alleys
the
work
on
whitney
is
done
and
successfully
the
rest
is
routine
laboratory
work
a
matter
of
quantities
and
methods
of
application
i
do
know
that
i
can
spare
you
any
more
money
miss
francis
she
laughed
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
you
weener
are
your
millions
melting
away
or
do
you
think
any
of
the
spies
you
set
on
me
capable
of
carrying
on
or
are
you
just
trying
to
crack
the
whip
i
set
no
spies
and
i
have
no
whip
i
merely
feel
it
may
not
be
profitable
to
waste
any
more
money
on
fruitless
experiments
she
snorted
time
has
streamlined
and
inflated
your
platitudes
when
i
am
too
old
to
work
and
ready
for
euthanasia
i
shall
have
you
come
and
talk
me
to
death
to
hear
you
one
would
almost
think
you
had
no
interest
in
finding
a
method
to
counter
the
grass
her
egomania
and
impertinence
were
really
insufferable
her
notion
of
her
own
importance
was
ludicrous
interested
or
not
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
you
alone
are
capable
of
scientific
discovery
anyway
the
world
seems
pretty
well
off
as
it
is
she
tugged
at
her
hair
as
if
it
were
false
and
would
come
off
if
she
jerked
hard
enough
of
course
it
well
enough
off
from
your
pointofview
it
offers
you
more
food
than
you
could
eat
if
you
had
a
million
bellies
more
clothes
than
you
could
wear
out
in
a
million
years
more
houses
than
you
could
live
in
if
the
million
contradictions
which
go
to
make
up
any
single
human
were
suddenly
made
corporeal
of
course
youre
satisfied
why
shouldnt
you
be
if
the
grass
were
to
be
pushed
back
and
the
world
once
more
enlarged
if
hope
and
dissatisfaction
were
again
to
replace
despair
and
content
you
might
not
find
yourself
such
a
big
toad
in
a
small
puddle
and
you
wouldnt
like
that
would
you
i
had
intended
all
along
to
give
her
a
small
pension
to
keep
her
from
want
and
allow
her
to
putter
around
but
her
irrational
accusations
and
insults
only
showed
her
to
be
the
kind
from
whom
no
gratitude
could
be
expected
i
afraid
we
can
be
of
no
further
use
to
each
other
look
here
weener
you
ca
do
this
the
life
of
civilization
depends
on
countering
the
grass
do
tell
me
the
world
can
go
on
only
half
alive
look
around
you
and
notice
the
recession
every
day
outside
of
your
own
subservient
laboratories
what
scientific
work
is
being
done
since
palomar
and
mount
wilson
and
flagstaff
went
what
has
happened
in
astronomy
if
you
pick
up
the
shrunken
pages
of
your
or
do
you
wonder
at
the
reason
for
their
shrinkage
or
do
you
realize
there
are
fewer
literates
in
the
world
than
there
were
ten
years
ago
the
americas
were
upstart
continents
werent
they
i
am
not
speaking
sarcastically
my
point
is
not
a
chauvinistic
one
not
even
hemispherically
prideful
and
the
old
world
the
womb
of
culture
but
how
much
culture
has
that
womb
borne
since
the
americas
disappeared
without
a
doubt
there
are
exactly
the
same
number
of
composers
and
painters
writers
and
sculptors
alive
on
the
four
continents
today
as
there
were
when
there
were
six
but
in
this
drowsy
halfworld
how
many
books
of
importance
are
being
produced
there
are
plenty
of
books
already
in
existence
besides
those
things
go
by
cycles
god
give
me
patience
this
is
the
man
who
has
humanity
prostrate
humanity
seems
quite
content
in
the
position
you
ascribe
to
it
of
course
of
course
that
the
tragedy
it
content
the
same
way
a
man
who
has
just
had
his
legs
cut
off
is
content
suffering
from
shock
and
loss
of
blood
he
enters
a
merciful
coma
from
which
he
may
never
emerge
the
legs
do
not
write
the
books
or
think
the
thoughts
whether
these
activities
wait
for
the
cyclical
moment
or
not
but
the
brain
dependent
on
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
the
wellbeing
of
the
rest
of
the
body
for
proper
functioning
and
who
are
you
little
man
to
stand
in
the
way
of
assisting
the
patient
i
shall
not
argue
with
you
any
further
miss
francis
if
mankind
is
really
as
subject
to
your
efforts
as
your
conceit
leads
you
to
believe
then
i
am
sure
you
will
find
some
way
to
continue
them
i
sure
i
will
she
said
and
we
left
it
at
that
to
say
her
accusations
had
been
gravely
unjust
would
be
to
defend
myself
where
no
defense
is
called
for
i
merely
remark
in
passing
that
i
gave
orders
to
set
aside
a
still
greater
fund
toward
finding
a
reagent
against
the
grass
and
to
put
those
who
had
lately
assisted
miss
francis
in
charge
i
did
this
not
because
i
swallowed
her
strained
analogy
about
a
sufferer
with
his
legs
cut
off
but
for
purely
practical
reasons
the
world
was
very
well
as
it
was
but
an
effective
weapon
against
the
grass
might
at
last
make
possible
the
neverdiscarded
vision
of
utilizing
it
beneficially
meanwhile
life
went
on
with
a
smoothness
strange
and
gratifying
to
those
of
us
born
into
a
period
of
strife
and
restlessness
no
more
wars
strikes
riots
agitation
for
higher
wages
or
social
experiments
by
wildeyed
fanatics
those
whose
limitations
laid
out
a
career
of
toil
performed
their
function
with
as
much
efficiency
as
one
could
expect
and
we
others
who
had
risen
and
separated
ourselves
from
the
herd
carried
our
responsibilities
and
accepted
the
rewards
which
went
with
them
the
ships
of
the
world
congress
continued
patrolling
the
coasts
of
the
deserted
continents
and
restrictions
were
so
far
relaxed
as
to
permit
planeflights
over
the
area
to
take
motionpictures
and
confirm
the
grass
had
lost
none
of
its
vigor
beyond
this
the
generality
of
mankind
forgot
the
weed
and
the
regions
it
covered
living
geographically
as
though
columbus
had
never
set
forth
from
palos
it
was
at
this
time
a
new
philosophic
idea
was
advanced
giving
the
lie
to
miss
francis
dictum
that
no
new
thoughts
were
being
thought
which
was
briefly
that
the
grass
was
essentially
a
good
thing
in
itself
that
the
world
had
not
merely
made
the
best
of
a
bad
situation
but
had
been
brought
to
a
beneficent
condition
through
the
loss
of
the
western
hemisphere
mankind
had
desperately
needed
a
brake
upon
its
heedless
course
some
instrumentality
to
limit
it
and
bring
it
to
realization
of
its
proper
province
the
grass
had
acted
as
such
an
agent
and
now
rightly
chastised
man
could
go
about
his
fit
business
this
concept
gained
almost
immediate
popular
support
so
far
as
it
filtered
down
to
the
masses
at
all
prominent
schoolmen
endorsed
it
wholeheartedly
statesmen
gave
it
qualified
approval
in
principle
and
the
pope
issued
an
encyclical
calling
for
a
return
of
christian
resignation
and
submission
hardly
was
the
ink
dry
upon
the
expressions
of
thanksgiving
for
the
punishment
which
had
brought
about
a
new
and
better
frameofmind
than
the
philosophy
was
suddenly
and
dramatically
tested
by
events
the
island
of
juan
fernandez
robinson
crusoe
island
a
peak
pushed
out
of
the
waters
of
the
pacific
miles
west
of
chile
densely
populated
with
refugees
and
a
base
for
patrolboats
was
overrun
by
the
grass
it
was
an
impossible
happening
every
inhabitant
had
had
personal
experience
of
the
grass
and
was
fearfully
alert
against
its
appearance
the
patrols
covered
the
sea
between
it
and
the
mainland
constantly
the
distance
was
too
far
for
windborne
seeds
the
tenuous
hypothesis
that
gulls
had
acted
as
carriers
was
accepted
simply
for
want
of
a
better
but
the
world
congress
wasted
no
time
looking
backward
although
between
juan
fernandez
and
the
next
land
westward
the
distance
was
three
times
greater
than
between
it
and
south
america
the
congress
seized
upon
the
only
island
to
which
it
could
possibly
spread
and
made
of
it
a
veritable
fortress
against
the
grass
not
only
did
ships
guard
its
waters
by
day
and
keep
it
brilliantly
lit
with
their
searchlights
at
night
but
swift
pursuitplanes
bristling
with
machineguns
brought
down
every
bird
in
flight
within
a
thousand
miles
the
island
itself
was
sown
with
salt
a
halfmile
thick
after
being
mined
with
enough
explosives
to
blow
it
into
the
sea
the
world
or
that
portion
of
it
which
had
not
fully
accepted
all
the
implications
of
the
doctrine
of
submission
watched
eagerly
but
the
ships
patrolled
an
empty
sea
the
searchlights
reflected
only
the
glittering
saline
crystals
the
migrant
birds
never
reached
their
destination
the
outpost
held
impregnable
again
everyone
breathed
easier
five
hundred
miles
beyond
this
focalpoint
its
convict
settlement
long
abandoned
was
easter
island
rapa
nui
home
of
the
great
monoliths
whose
origin
had
ever
been
a
puzzle
erect
or
supine
these
colossal
statues
were
strewn
all
over
the
island
anthropologists
and
archaeologists
still
came
to
give
them
cursory
inspection
and
it
was
on
such
a
visit
an
unmistakable
clump
of
grass
was
found
immediately
the
ships
were
rushed
from
planes
carrying
tons
of
salt
took
off
from
australia
and
the
whole
machinery
of
the
world
congress
was
swiftly
put
in
operation
but
it
was
too
late
easter
island
was
swamped
uninhabited
ducie
went
next
and
pitcairn
home
of
the
descendants
of
the
mutineers
followed
before
even
the
slightest
precautions
could
be
taken
the
grass
was
jumping
gaps
of
thousands
of
miles
in
a
breathless
steeplechase
on
pitcairn
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
rescue
the
inhabitants
vessels
stood
by
to
carry
them
and
their
livestock
off
the
palebrown
men
and
women
left
for
the
most
part
docilely
but
the
last
adams
and
the
last
mccoy
refused
to
go
once
before
our
people
were
forced
to
leave
pitcairn
and
found
nothing
but
unhappiness
we
will
stay
on
the
island
to
which
our
fathers
brought
their
wives
there
was
no
stopping
the
grass
now
even
if
the
means
had
been
to
hand
the
gambiers
the
tuamotus
and
the
marquesas
were
swallowed
up
tahiti
dwellingplace
of
beautiful
if
syphilitic
women
disappeared
under
a
green
blanket
as
did
the
cook
islands
samoa
and
the
fijis
the
grass
jumped
southward
to
a
foothold
in
new
zealand
and
northward
into
micronesia
panic
infected
the
australians
and
a
mass
migration
to
the
central
part
of
the
country
was
begun
but
with
little
hope
the
surrounding
deserts
would
offer
any
effective
barrier
my
first
thought
when
i
heard
the
grass
for
the
second
time
had
broken
its
bounds
was
that
i
had
perhaps
been
a
little
hasty
with
miss
francis
it
was
not
at
all
likely
she
would
succeed
where
so
many
better
trained
and
better
equipped
scientists
had
so
far
failed
but
i
felt
a
vicarious
sympathy
with
her
as
being
out
of
the
picture
when
all
her
colleagues
were
striving
with
might
and
main
to
save
the
world
especially
after
the
years
she
had
spent
on
mount
whitney
it
would
be
an
act
of
simple
generosity
on
my
part
i
thought
to
give
her
the
wherewithal
to
entertain
the
illusion
of
importance
when
all
was
said
and
done
she
was
a
woman
and
i
could
afford
a
chivalrous
gesture
even
in
the
face
of
her
overweening
arrogance
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
responded
with
complete
illgrace
i
knew
youd
eventually
have
to
come
crawling
to
me
to
save
your
hide
you
mistake
the
situation
entirely
miss
francis
i
informed
her
with
dignity
i
am
conferring
not
asking
favors
i
have
every
confidence
in
my
research
staff
my
god
those
guineapig
murderers
those
discoveryforgers
those
whitesmocked
acolytes
in
the
temple
of
yes
you
value
your
life
or
your
purse
at
exactly
what
theyre
worth
if
you
expect
those
drugstoreclerks
to
preserve
them
for
you
i
doubt
if
either
is
in
the
slightest
danger
i
assured
her
confidently
hysterics
have
lost
perspective
long
before
the
grass
becomes
an
immediate
concern
my
drugstoreclerks
with
less
exalted
opinions
of
their
talents
than
you
will
have
found
the
means
to
destroy
it
a
soothing
fairytale
weener
the
truth
is
not
in
you
you
know
the
reason
you
come
to
me
is
that
youre
frightened
scared
terrified
well
strangely
enough
i
not
going
to
reject
your
munificence
i
accept
it
because
to
do
god
work
is
more
important
than
any
personal
pride
of
mine
or
any
knowledge
that
one
of
the
best
things
could
do
if
i
do
not
take
too
much
upon
myself
in
judging
a
fellowcreature
would
be
to
bury
albert
weener
i
remained
unmoved
by
her
tirade
when
you
returned
from
whitney
you
told
me
there
remained
only
details
to
be
worked
out
about
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
be
before
you
have
a
workable
compound
she
burst
into
a
laugh
and
took
out
her
toothpick
to
point
it
at
me
go
and
put
your
penny
in
another
slot
if
you
want
an
answer
to
an
idiot
question
like
that
how
long
a
day
a
month
a
year
ten
years
in
ten
years
i
began
exactly
she
said
and
put
away
the
toothpick
i
phoned
stuart
thario
to
fly
over
right
away
for
a
conference
general
i
began
we
have
to
start
looking
ahead
and
making
plans
he
hid
his
mustache
with
the
side
of
his
forefinger
do
quite
understand
albert
have
details
here
of
activities
next
three
years
i
pressed
the
buzzer
for
my
secretary
bring
general
thario
some
refreshment
i
ordered
the
command
was
not
only
familiar
on
the
occasion
of
his
visits
but
evidently
anticipated
for
she
appeared
in
a
moment
with
a
trayful
of
bottles
bad
habit
of
yours
albert
teetotalism
makes
the
brain
cloudy
insidious
he
took
a
long
drink
very
little
real
bourbon
left
european
imitation
vile
learning
to
like
holland
gin
he
drank
again
to
get
back
to
the
business
of
making
plans
general
i
urged
gently
not
one
of
those
people
getting
worried
about
the
grass
not
worried
just
trying
to
look
ahead
i
ca
afford
to
be
caught
napping
well
well
he
said
ca
pull
another
south
american
this
time
no
no
and
besides
i
not
concerned
with
money
now
albert
do
tell
me
youve
finally
got
enough
this
is
not
the
time
to
be
avaricious
i
reproved
him
if
the
grass
continues
to
spread
and
there
seems
to
be
little
doubt
it
will
all
of
new
zealand
north
island
was
finished
this
morning
he
interrupted
i
heard
it
myself
anyway
that
the
point
as
the
grass
advances
there
will
be
new
hordes
of
refugees
he
was
certainly
in
an
impatient
mood
this
morning
for
he
interrupted
me
again
new
markets
for
concentrates
he
suggested
i
looked
at
him
pityingly
was
the
old
man
mind
slipping
i
wondered
if
it
would
be
necessary
to
replace
him
general
i
said
gently
with
rare
exceptions
these
people
will
have
nothing
but
worthless
currency
goods
labor
have
you
seen
the
previous
batches
of
refugees
foresighted
enough
to
get
out
any
goods
of
value
before
starting
off
and
as
for
labor
all
our
workers
are
now
so
heavily
subsidized
by
the
dole
that
to
cut
wages
another
cent
corrected
general
thario
centime
if
you
like
would
be
merely
to
increase
our
taxes
well
well
he
said
i
see
i
have
been
hasty
what
did
you
have
in
mind
albert
retrenchment
cut
production
abandon
the
factories
in
the
immediate
path
of
the
grass
fix
on
reasonably
safe
spots
to
store
depots
of
the
finished
concentrates
others
for
raw
materials
or
perhaps
they
might
be
combined
what
about
the
factories
smaller
i
said
practically
portable
hum
he
frowned
you
do
intend
to
do
business
on
a
small
scale
minute
i
confirmed
what
about
the
mines
the
steelmills
the
oilfields
the
airplane
and
automobile
factories
the
shipyards
shut
them
down
i
ordered
ruthlessly
except
maybe
a
few
in
england
the
countries
where
theyre
located
will
grab
them
there
isnt
a
government
in
existence
who
would
dare
touch
anything
belonging
to
consolidated
pemmican
if
any
should
come
into
existence
our
individualistic
friends
would
take
care
of
the
situation
pay
gangsters
to
overturn
governments
they
would
hardly
be
legitimate
governments
anyway
a
man
has
a
right
to
protect
his
property
albert
he
complained
querulously
youre
condemning
civilization
to
death
general
i
said
youre
talking
like
a
wildeyed
crackpot
a
businessman
concern
is
with
business
he
leaves
abstractions
to
visionaries
our
plants
will
be
closed
down
because
until
the
grass
is
stopped
they
can
make
us
no
profit
let
some
idealistic
industrialist
take
care
of
civilization
albert
you
know
very
well
no
business
of
any
size
can
operate
today
without
your
active
support
think
again
albert
listen
to
me
as
a
friend
we
have
been
associated
a
long
time
and
to
some
extent
you
have
taken
joe
place
in
my
mind
consider
the
larger
aspects
suppose
you
do
make
a
profit
suppose
you
even
take
a
loss
you
can
afford
to
do
it
for
common
humanity
i
certainly
think
i
do
my
share
for
common
humanity
general
thario
and
it
cuts
me
to
the
heart
that
you
of
all
people
should
imply
such
a
sentimental
and
unjust
reproach
against
me
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
i
have
given
more
than
half
my
fortune
to
charitable
works
albert
albert
need
there
be
this
hypocrisy
between
you
and
me
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
only
know
i
called
you
to
evolve
specific
plans
and
you
have
embarked
instead
on
windy
platitudes
and
personal
insult
he
sat
for
a
long
time
quietly
his
drink
untouched
before
him
i
did
not
disturb
his
meditation
but
indulged
in
one
on
my
own
account
thinking
of
all
i
had
done
for
him
and
his
family
but
only
a
foolish
man
expects
gratitude
or
for
that
matter
any
reward
at
all
for
his
kindnesses
at
last
he
broke
his
silence
speaking
slowly
almost
painfully
i
have
not
had
what
could
be
called
a
successful
life
even
though
today
i
am
a
wealthy
man
he
resumed
his
drink
again
and
i
wondered
what
this
remark
had
to
do
with
the
subject
in
hand
perhaps
nothing
i
thought
he
is
just
rambling
along
while
he
reconciles
himself
to
the
situation
i
was
glad
he
was
going
to
be
sensible
afterall
not
that
it
mattered
i
could
get
many
able
lieutenants
but
for
oldtime
sake
i
was
pleased
at
the
abandonment
of
his
recalcitrance
he
relaxed
further
into
the
chair
while
i
waited
to
resume
the
practical
discussion
when
you
first
came
to
me
in
washington
albert
seeking
warcontracts
for
your
microscopic
business
i
suppose
there
was
even
then
a
mark
upon
your
forehead
but
i
was
too
heavy
with
the
guilt
of
my
own
affairs
to
see
it
we
all
have
our
price
albert
sometimes
it
is
another
star
on
the
shoulderstraps
or
a
peerage
or
wealth
or
the
apparent
safety
of
a
son
i
have
come
a
long
way
with
you
since
then
albert
through
shady
deals
and
brilliant
coups
and
dark
passages
which
would
not
bear
too
much
investigation
i
afraid
i
can
not
go
any
further
with
you
you
will
have
to
get
someone
else
to
kill
civilization
as
you
choose

agreed

have
always
tried
however
inadequately
to

my

stood
up
thank
you

said
i
shall
certainly
consider
the
sahara
as
location
for

you
wo
change
your
mind
about
this
whole
thing
albert
i
shook
my
head
how
could
i
fly
in
the
face
of
commonsense
to
gratify
the
silly
whim
of
an
old
man
whose
intelligence
was
clearly
not
what
it
had
once
been
i
was
afraid
not
he
muttered
afraid
not
i
do
blame
you
albert
men
are
as
god
created
them
or

as
the

say
you
didnt
put

called

thario
they
said
chronos
would
be
better
classical
allusion
escapes
the
enlistedman
he
walked
out
still
mumbling
inarticulately
and
i
sat
there
saddened
that
a
man
once
alert
and
vigorous
as
the
general
should
have
come
at
last
to
senility
and
an
enfeebled
mind
the
defection
of
general
thario
threw
a
great
burden
of
work
upon
my
shoulders
preblesham
was
able
enough
in
his
own
sphere
but
his
vision
was
not
sufficiently
broad
to
operate
at
the
highest
levels
the
process
of
closing
down
our
plants
was
more
complicated
than
had
been
anticipated
and
thario
military
mind
would
have
been
more
useful
than
preblesham
theological
one
the
employees
conceiving
through
some
fantastic
logic
that
their
jobs
were
as
much
their
property
as
the
mills
or
mines
or
factorybuildings
were
mine
rioted
and
had
to
be
pacified
the
first
time
such
a
tactic
was
resorted
to
in
years
in
some
places
these
misguided
men
actually
took
possession
of
the
places
where
they
worked
and
tried
to
operate
them
but
of
course
they
were
balked
by
their
own
inefficiency
human
nature
being
what
it
is
they
tried
to
blame
their
helplessness
on
my
control
of
their
sources
of
raw
material
and
their
consequent
inability
to
obtain
vital
supplies
as
well
as
the
cutting
off
of
light
and
power
from
the
seized
plants
but
this
was
mere
buckpassing
always
noticeable
when
some
radical
scheme
fails
but
the
setting
up
of
depots
in
the
sahara
as
general
thario
had
suggested
and
by
extension
in
arabia
was
a
different
matter
here
preblesham
genius
shone
he
flew
our
whole
australian
store
of
raw
materials
out
without
a
loss
he
recruited
gangs
of
chinese
coolies
with
an
efficiency
which
would
have
put
an
oldtime
blackbirder
to
shame
he
argued
cajoled
bullied
sweated
for
twentyfour
hours
a
day
and
when
in
six
months
he
had
completed
his
task
we
had
seven
depots
two
in
arabia
and
five
in
africa
complete
with
four
factories
with
enough
concentrates
on
hand
to
feed
the
world
for
a
year
if
the
world
had
the
means
to
pay
which
it
didnt
and
to
operate
for
five
during
those
six
months
the
grass
ravenously
snatched
morsel
after
morsel
new
zealand
south
island
new
caledonia
the
solomons
and
the
marianas
were
gobbled
at
the
same
moment
it
gorged
on
new
guinea
and
searched
out
the
minor
islands
of
the
east
indies
as
a
cat
searches
for
baby
fieldmice
in
a
nest
her
paw
has
discovered
it
took
a
bite
of
the
queensland
coast
just
below
the
great
barrier
reef
the
next
day
it
was
reported
near
townsville
and
soon
after
on
the
cape
york
peninsula
the
australian
finger
pointing
upward
to
islands
where
lived
little
black
men
with
woolly
hair
the
people
of
melbourne
and
sydney
and
brisbane
took
the
coming
of
the
grass
with
calm
anger
preparations
for
removal
had
been
made
months
before
and
this
migration
was
distinguished
from
previous
ones
by
its
order
and
completeness
but
although
they
moved
calmly
in
accordance
with
clear
plans
their
anger
was
directed
against
all
those
in
authority
who
had
failed
to
take
measures
to
protect
their
beloved
land
queensland
new
south
wales
victoria
and
tasmania
went
the
grass
swept
southward
like
a
sickle
cutting
through
south
australia
and
biting
deep
with
its
point
into
western
although
we
were
amply
provided
with
raw
material
considering
the
curtailment
of
our
activities
preblesham
on
the
spot
could
not
resist
buying
up
great
herds
of
sheep
for
a
penny
on
the
pound
and
having
them
driven
northward
in
the
hope
of
finding
somehow
a
means
to
ship
them
i
am
sorry
to
say
though
i
afraid
i
could
have
predicted
it
this
venture
was
a
total
loss
burlet
unfolding
the
on
my
breakfastplate
coughed
respectfully
if
i
could
speak
to
you
at
your
convenience
sir
what
is
it
burlet
lord
arpers
finally
come
through
with
a
higher
offer
not
at
all
sir
i
consider
the
question
of
service
closed
as
long
as
you
find
yourself
satisfied
sir
quite
satisfied
burlet
i
ad
in
mind
the
discussion
of
quite
another
matter
sir
not
relating
to
domestic
issues
very
well
burlet
come
into
the
library
after
breakfast
very
good
sir
with
a
world
of
problems
on
my
mind
i
thought
it
would
be
wryly
amusing
to
resolve
whatever
difficulties
troubled
my
butler
promptly
after
i
had
settled
myself
at
my
desk
and
before
i
rang
for
my
secretary
burlet
appeared
in
the
doorway
his
striped
vest
smoothed
down
over
his
rounded
abdomen
every
thin
hair
in
place
over
the
dome
of
his
balding
head
come
in
burlet
sit
down
what
on
your
mind
thank
you
sir
to
my
surprise
he
accepted
my
invitation
and
seated
himself
opposite
me
i
ave
been
speculating
sir
really
burlet
silly
thing
to
do
lost
all
your
wages
i
suppose
and
would
like
an
advance
you
misappre
end
me
sir
not
speculating
on
change
speculating
on
the
grass
oh
and
did
you
arrive
at
any
conclusion
burlet
i
believe
i
ave
sir
as
i
understand
it
scientists
and
statesmen
are
exerting
their
energies
to
fight
the
grass
that
right
i
was
beginning
to
be
bored
had
the
butler
fallen
prey
to
one
of
the
graminophile
sects
like
brother
paul
and
gone
through
all
this
rigmarole
merely
to
give
me
notice
previous
to
immolating
himself
and
so
far
they
ave
achieved
no
success
obviously
burlet
well
then
sir
would
it
not
be
a
sensible
precaution
to
find
some
means
of
refuge
until
and
if
they
find
a
way
to
kill
the
grass
there
is
no
burlet
the
means
will
be
found
and
shortly
of
that
i
am
sure
as
for
temporary
refuge
until
that
time
no
doubt
it
would
be
excellent
if
practicable
what
do
you
propose
emigration
to
mars
or
floating
islands
in
the
oceans
both
of
these
expedients
had
long
ago
been
put
forth
by
contestants
in
the
journeys
to
other
planets
would
not
solve
things
sir
assuming
the
construction
of
a
vessel
an
assumption
so
far
unwarranted
if
i
may
say
so
sir
it
would
accommodate
but
a
fraction
of
the
affected
populations
as
for
floating
islands
they
would
be
no
more
immune
to
airborne
seeds
than
stationary
ones
so
it
was
discovered
long
ago
burlet
quite
so
sir
then
if
i
may
say
so
protection
must
be
afforded
on
the
spot
and
how
do
you
propose
to
do
that
well
sir
by
the
building
of
vertical
cities
vertical
cities
yes
sir
i
believe
sites
should
be
selected
near
bodies
of
fresh
water
and
tremendous
excavations
made
the
walls
and
floor
of
the
excavations
should
be
lined
with
concrete
through
which
the
water
is
piped
the
cities
could
be
on
many
levels
the
topmost
peraps
several
miles
in
the
air
glass
enclosed
and
with
pipes
reaching
still
igher
to
bring
air
in
and
completely
tight
against
the
grass
they
should
be
selfcontained
generating
their
own
power
and
providing
their
food
by
ydroponic
farming
such
cities
could
hold
millions
of
people
now
doomed
until
a
way
is
found
to
kill
the
grass
there
was
a
faintly
familiar
ring
to
the
scheme
you
seem
to
have
worked
it
out
thoroughly
burlet
polishing
the
plate
sir
polishing
the
plate
it
leaves
the
mind
free
for
cerebration
i
ave
a
full
set
of
blueprints
and
specifications
if
youd
like
to
inspect
them
sir
it
was
fantastic
i
thought
and
probably
quite
impractical
but
i
promised
to
submit
his
plans
to
those
with
more
technical
knowledge
than
i
possessed
i
sent
his
carefully
written
papers
to
an
undersecretary
of
the
world
congress
and
forgot
the
matter
idleness
certainly
led
to
queer
occupations
vertical
cities
and
who
in
the
world
had
the
money
to
erect
these
nightmare
structures
only
albert
weener
that
was
probably
why
burlet
took
advantage
of
his
position
to
approach
me
with
the
scheme
completely
absurd
probably
the
complaints
of
the
australians
gave
final
impetus
to
the
congress
to
combat
the
grass
they
met
in
extraordinary
session
in
budapest
and
declared
themselves
the
executive
body
of
a
world
government
which
did
not
of
course
include
the
socialist
union
all
qualified
scientists
were
immediately
ordered
to
leave
whatever
employment
they
had
and
place
themselves
at
the
disposition
of
the
world
government
affluence
for
life
guaranteed
against
any
fluctuations
of
currency
was
promised
to
anyone
who
could
offer
not
necessarily
an
answer
but
an
idea
which
should
lead
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
in
hand
while
they
were
issuing
their
first
edicts
the
grass
finished
off
the
east
indies
covered
threequarters
of
australia
and
attacked
the
southern
philippines
millions
of
indonesians
traveling
the
comparatively
short
distances
in
anything
floatable
crowded
the
already
overpopulated
areas
of
asia
as
i
had
predicted
to
general
thario
these
refugees
carried
nothing
with
which
to
purchase
the
concentrates
to
keep
them
alive
and
conditions
of
famine
in
india
and
china
essentially
due
to
the
backwardness
of
these
countries
offered
no
subsistence
to
the
natives
much
less
to
an
influx
from
outside
the
grass
sped
northward
and
westward
through
the
malay
states
and
siam
up
into
china
and
burma
in
the
beginning
the
orientals
did
not
flee
but
stood
their
ground
village
by
village
and
family
by
family
opposing
the
advance
with
scythes
stones
and
pitiful
bonfires
of
their
household
belongings
with
hoes
flails
and
finally
with
their
bare
hands
but
the
naked
hand
no
matter
how
often
multiplied
was
as
unable
to
halt
the
green
flow
as
the
most
uptodate
weapons
of
modern
science
and
the
chinese
and
the
hindus
dying
at
their
posts
were
no
more
an
obstacle
than
mountain
or
desert
or
stretches
of
empty
sea
had
been
it
was
now
deemed
expedient
in
order
to
keep
public
hysteria
from
rising
to
new
selfdestructive
heights
to
tone
down
and
modify
the
news
this
proved
quite
difficult
at
first
for
the
people
in
their
shortsightedness
clamored
for
the
accounts
of
impending
doom
which
they
devoured
with
a
dreadful
fascination
but
eventually
when
the
wildest
rumors
produced
by
the
dearth
of
accurate
reports
were
disproved
many
of
the
people
in
western
europe
and
africa
actually
believed
the
grass
had
somehow
failed
to
make
headway
on
the
asiatic
continent
and
would
have
remained
in
their
pleasant
ignorance
had
it
not
been
for
the
premature
flight
of
masses
of
asiatics
for
the
phenomenon
contemporary
with
the
close
of
the
roman
empire
was
repeated
a
great
struggling
churning
sprawling
desperate
efflux
from
east
to
west
began
once
more
the
golden
horde
was
on
the
march
they
did
not
come
as
had
their
ancestors
on
wildly
charging
horses
threatening
with
lances
and
deadly
scimitars
but
on
foot
wretched
and
begging
even
had
i
been
as
maudlin
as
stuart
thario
desired
i
could
not
have
fed
these
people
for
there
were
no
longer
railroads
with
rollingstock
adequate
to
carry
the
freight
no
fleets
of
trucks
in
good
repair
nor
was
the
fuel
available
had
they
existed
the
world
receded
rapidly
from
the
machineage
and
as
it
did
so
famine
and
pestilence
increased
in
evermounting
spirals
the
mob
of
refugees
might
be
likened
to
a
beast
with
weak
almost
atrophied
legs
but
with
a
great
mouth
and
greater
stomach
it
moved
with
painful
slowness
crawling
over
the
face
of
southern
asia
finding
little
sustenance
as
it
came
leaving
none
whatever
after
it
left
the
beast
only
dimly
aware
of
the
grass
it
was
fleeing
from
could
formulate
no
thoughts
of
the
refuge
it
sought
without
plan
hope
or
malice
it
was
concerned
only
with
hunger
day
and
night
its
empty
gut
cried
for
food
the
starving
men
and
women
the
children
died
quickly
ate
first
all
that
was
available
in
the
stores
and
homes
then
scrabbled
in
the
fields
for
a
forgotten
grain
of
rice
or
wheat
they
ate
the
bark
and
fungus
from
the
trees
and
gleaned
the
pastures
of
their
weeds
and
dung
as
they
ate
they
moved
on
their
faminedistended
stomachs
craving
more
to
eat
driving
the
ones
who
were
but
one
step
further
from
starvation
ever
before
them
long
ago
they
had
chewed
on
the
leather
of
their
footgear
and
devoured
all
cats
dogs
and
rodents
they
ate
the
stiffened
and
putrid
carcasses
of
draft
animals
which
had
been
pushed
to
the
last
extremity
they
turned
upon
the
corpses
of
the
newly
dead
and
fed
on
them
and
at
length
did
not
wait
for
death
from
hunger
to
make
a
new
cadaver
but
mercifully
slew
the
weak
and
ate
the
still
warm
bodies
the
asiatic
influx
was
a
social
accordion
the
pulledout
end
the
high
notes
as
it
were
the
indian
princes
chinese
warlords
arrived
quickly
and
settled
into
a
welcoming
obscurity
they
came
by
plane
with
gold
and
jewels
and
government
bonds
and
shares
of
consolidated
pemmican
the
middle
creases
of
the
accordion
came
later
more
slowly
but
as
quickly
as
money
could
speed
their
way
men
of
wealth
when
they
began
their
journey
they
arrived
little
more
than
penniless
and
were
looked
upon
with
suspicion
tolerated
only
so
long
as
they
did
not
become
a
public
charge
the
low
notes
the
thick
and
heavy
pleats
took
not
days
nor
weeks
nor
months
but
years
to
make
the
trek
they
kept
but
a
step
ahead
of
the
grass
traveling
at
the
same
pace
they
came
not
alone
but
with
accretions
pushing
ahead
of
them
millions
of
their
same
dispossessed
hungry
penniless
kind
these
were
not
greeted
with
suspicion
but
with
hatred
machineguns
were
turned
upon
the
advancing
mobs
the
few
airplanes
in
service
were
commandeered
to
bomb
them
and
only
lack
of
fuel
and
explosives
allowed
them
to
sweep
into
europe
and
overwhelm
most
of
it
as
the
barbarians
had
overwhelmed
rome
but
i
anticipate
while
the
bulk
of
the
orientals
was
still
beyond
the
himalayas
and
the
gobi
europe
indulged
in
a
wild
saturnalia
to
celebrate
its
own
doom
all
pretense
of
sexual
morality
vanished
men
and
women
coupled
openly
upon
the
streets
the
small
illprinted
newspapers
carried
advertisements
promising
the
gratification
of
strange
lusts
a
new
cult
of
priapus
sprang
up
and
virgins
were
ceremoniously
deflowered
at
his
shrine
those
beyond
the
age
of
concupiscence
attended
celebrations
of
the
black
mass
although
i
was
told
by
one
communicant
that
participation
lacked
the
necessary
zest
since
none
possessed
a
faith
to
which
blasphemy
could
give
a
shocking
thrill
murder
was
indulged
in
purely
for
the
pleasure
men
and
women
hearing
of
the
cannibalism
raging
among
the
refugees
adopted
and
refined
it
for
their
own
amusement
small
promiscuous
groups
at
the
end
of
orgies
chose
the
man
and
woman
tiring
soonest
the
two
victims
were
thereupon
killed
and
devoured
by
their
late
paramours
as
there
was
a
cult
to
priapus
so
there
was
an
equally
strong
cult
to
diana
the
monasteries
and
convents
overflowed
but
in
the
tension
of
the
moment
many
were
not
satisfied
with
mere
vows
of
celibacy
in
secret
and
impressive
ceremonies
women
scarified
their
tenderest
parts
with
redhot
irons
thus
proving
themselves
forever
beyond
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
men
solemnly
castrated
themselves
and
threw
the
symbols
of
their
manhood
into
a
consuming
fire
i
wouldnt
want
to
give
the
impression
bestial
madness
of
one
kind
or
another
overtook
everyone
there
were
plenty
of
normal
people
like
myself
who
were
able
to
maintain
their
selfcontrol
and
canalize
those
energies
promoting
crimes
and
beastly
exhibitions
in
the
unrestrained
into
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
the
grass
would
be
gone
and
sanity
return
nor
would
i
like
anyone
to
think
law
and
order
had
completely
abdicated
its
function
as
offenses
multiplied
laws
grew
more
severe
misdemeanors
became
felonies
felonies
capital
offenses
when
death
by
hanging
became
the
prescribed
sentence
for
any
type
of
theft
it
was
necessary
to
make
the
punishment
for
murder
more
drastic
drawing
and
quartering
were
reinstituted
this
not
proving
an
efficient
deterrent
many
jurists
advocated
a
return
to
the
roman
practice
of
spreadeagling
a
man
to
death
but
the
churches
vigorously
objected
to
this
suggestion
as
blasphemous
believing
the
ordinary
sight
of
crucified
murderers
would
tend
to
debase
the
central
symbol
of
christianity
a
less
common
roman
usage
was
adopted
in
its
stead
that
of
being
torn
by
hungry
dogs
and
to
this
the
christians
did
not
object
but
the
utmost
severity
of
local
and
national
officials
even
when
backed
by
the
might
of
world
government
could
not
cope
with
the
waves
of
migrants
from
the
east
nor
the
heedlessness
of
law
they
brought
with
them
as
the
grass
pushed
the
indians
and
chinese
westward
they
in
turn
sent
the
mongols
the
afghans
and
the
persians
ahead
of
them
these
naturally
warlike
peoples
were
displaced
not
by
force
of
arms
but
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
and
so
doubly
overcome
by
being
dispossessed
of
their
homes
and
by
pacifists
at
that
they
vented
their
pique
upon
those
to
the
west
as
the
starving
and
destitute
trickled
into
europe
and
north
africa
giving
a
hint
of
the
flood
to
follow
i
congratulated
myself
on
the
foresight
which
led
to
our
retrenchment
for
i
know
these
ravening
hordes
would
have
devoured
the
property
of
consolidated
pemmican
with
as
little
respect
as
they
did
the
scant
store
of
ah
que
ram
singh
or
mohammed
ali
my
chief
concern
was
now
to
keep
my
industrial
and
organizational
machinery
intact
against
the
day
when
a
stable
market
could
again
be
established
to
this
end
i
kept
our
vast
staff
of
researchworkers
exempt
from
the
draft
of
the
world
government
which
had
been
quite
reasonable
in
the
matter
constantly
busy
for
every
delay
in
the
arresting
of
the
grass
meant
a
dead
loss
of
profits
josephine
francis
alone
and
as
always
proved
completely
uncooperative
undoubtedly
much
of
her
stubbornness
was
due
to
her
sex
the
residue
to
her
unorthodox
approach
to
the
mysteries
of
science
when
i
prodded
her
for
results
she
snarled
she
was
not
a
slotmachine
when
i
pointed
out
tactfully
that
only
my
money
made
possible
the
continuation
of
her
efforts
she
told
me
rudely
to
seek
the
wailing
wall
in
jerusalem
before
it
was
covered
by
the
grass
again
and
again
i
urged
her
to
give
me
some
idea
how
long
it
would
be
before
she
could
produce
a
chemical
even
for
experimental
use
against
the
grass
and
each
time
she
turned
me
aside
with
insult
or
rude
jest
i
had
set
her
up
in
or
rather
to
be
more
accurate
she
had
insisted
upon
a
completely
equipped
and
isolated
laboratory
in
surrey
as
it
was
convenient
to
my
hampshire
place
i
dropped
in
almost
daily
upon
her
but
i
can
not
say
my
visits
perceptibly
quickened
her
lethargy
worried
weener
she
asked
me
absently
putting
down
a
coffeepot
on
a
stack
of
microscope
slides
eat
gold
and
banknotes
drillpresses
and
openhearths
as
readily
as
quartz
and
mica
dead
bodies
and
abandoned
household
goods
i
couldnt
resist
the
opening
anything
in
fact
i
pointed
out
except
salt
a
daniel
she
exclaimed
a
daniel
come
to
judgment
oh
weener
thou
shouldst
have
been
born
a
chemist
and
what
is
the
other
mistake
give
me
leave
to
throw
away
my
retorts
and
testtubes
and
bunsen
burners
by
revealing
the
other
element
besides
sodium
refuses
for
every
mistake
there
is
another
mistake
which
supplements
it
sodium
was
the
blindspot
in
the
metamorphizer
when
i
find
the
balancing
blindspot
i
shall
know
not
only
the
second
element
which
the
grass
can
not
absorb
but
one
which
will
be
poison
to
it
i
not
a
chemist
miss
francis
i
said
but
it
seems
to
me
ive
heard
there
are
a
limited
number
of
elements
there
are
and
three
states
for
each
element
and
an
infinite
number
of
conditions
governing
their
application
what
the
matter
arent
your
trained
seals
performing
all
the
research
laboratories
of
consolidated
pemmican
are
going
night
and
day
then
what
the
devil
are
you
hounding
me
for
let
them
find
the
counteragent
two
heads
are
better
than
one
nonsense
two
blockheads
are
worse
than
one
insofar
as
they
tend
to
regard
each
other
as
a
source
of
wisdom
i
shall
conquer
the
grass
i
alone
i
josephine
spencer
francis
and
as
soon
as
possible
now
you
have
all
the
data
in
its
most
specific
form
and
i
shall
accomplish
this
because
i
must
and
not
because
i
love
albert
weener
or
care
a
litmuspaper
whether
or
not
his
offal
is
swallowed
up
i
have
done
what
i
have
done
god
forgive
me
and
i
shall
undo
it
but
the
matter
is
between
me
and
a
larger
accountant
than
the
clerk
who
signs
your
monthly
checks
what
do
you
think
about
temporary
protective
measures
in
the
meanwhile
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
weener
protective
measures
what
euphuistic
gibberish
is
this
i
outlined
briefly
my
butler
plan
of
vertical
cities
miss
francis
startled
me
with
a
laugh
resembling
the
burst
of
machinegun
fire
someone
been
pulling
your
leg
poor
terrified
maecenas
or
else
youre
befuddled
with
too
many
wonder
pipes
into
the
stratosphere
watersupply
piped
in
through
concrete
walls
doesnt
your
mad
inventor
know
the
seeds
would
find
these
apertures
in
an
instant
oh
those
are
possibly
minor
flaws
which
could
be
remedied
well
go
and
remedy
them
and
leave
me
to
my
work
or
pin
your
faith
on
substantialities
instead
of
flights
of
fancy
i
went
up
to
london
my
mind
full
of
a
thousand
problems
i
had
caught
the
economical
british
habit
of
using
the
trains
conserving
the
petrol
and
tyres
on
my
car
the
first
thing
i
saw
on
the
marylebone
platform
was
the
crude
picture
in
green
chalk
of
a
stolon
of
what
idiot
i
thought
as
i
irritably
rubbed
at
it
with
the
sole
of
my
shoe
what
feebleminded
creature
has
been
let
loose
to
do
a
thing
like
this
the
brittle
chalk
smeared
beneath
my
foot
but
the
representation
remained
almost
recognizable
on
my
way
to
the
savoy
i
saw
it
again
defacing
a
hoarding
and
as
i
paid
off
my
driver
i
thought
i
caught
another
glimpse
of
the
nonsensical
drawing
on
the
side
of
a
lorry
going
by
perhaps
my
sensitivity
perceived
these
signs
before
they
were
common
property
but
in
a
few
days
they
were
spread
all
over
europe
through
what
insane
impulse
i
do
not
know
for
whatever
reason
symbols
of
the
grass
blossomed
on
the
arc
de
triomphe
on
the
brandenburger
tor
on
the
pavement
of
the
ringstrasse
and
on
the
bridges
spanning
the
danube
between
buda
and
pesth
i
find
myself
in
retrospect
involuntarily
telescoping
the
time
of
events
looking
backward
years
become
days
and
months
minutes
at
the
time
i
saw
the
first
reproductions
of
the
grass
in
london
the
thing
itself
was
continents
away
busy
absorbing
the
fringes
of
asia
but
its
heralds
and
victims
went
before
it
changing
the
life
of
man
as
it
had
itself
changed
the
face
of
the
world
the
breakdown
of
civilization
beyond
the
channel
was
almost
complete
only
consolidated
pemmican
and
the
world
government
still
maintained
communication
facilities
and
with
the
blocking
of
the
normal
ways
of
commerce
the
world
government
found
it
difficult
to
spread
either
news
or
decrees
to
the
general
public
the
most
fantastic
and
contradictory
ideas
about
the
grass
were
held
by
the
masses
when
the
grass
was
in
the
deccan
and
still
well
below
the
yangtze
the
athenians
were
thrown
into
panic
by
the
rumor
it
had
appeared
in
salonika
at
the
same
time
there
was
wild
rejoicing
in
the
streets
of
marseilles
based
on
the
belief
large
stretches
of
north
america
had
become
miraculously
free
the
cult
of
the
grass
idolaters
flourished
despite
the
strictest
interdictions
and
great
massmeetings
were
frequently
held
during
which
the
worshipers
turned
their
faces
toward
the
southeast
and
prayed
fervently
for
speedy
immolation
it
was
quite
useless
for
the
world
government
to
attempt
to
spread
the
actual
facts
the
earlier
censorship
together
with
a
public
temper
that
preferred
to
believe
the
extremes
of
good
or
bad
rather
than
the
truth
of
gradual
yet
relentless
approach
made
people
heedless
of
broadcasts
rarely
received
even
by
state
operated
publicaddress
systems
or
of
handbills
which
even
the
still
literate
could
not
bother
to
decipher
the
idealization
of
the
socialist
union
once
the
soviet
union
which
had
risen
and
fallen
through
the
years
was
quickened
among
those
not
enamored
of
the
grass
there
must
be
some
intrinsic
virtue
in
this
land
which
had
not
only
been
immune
to
inoculation
by
the
metamorphizer
but
kept
the
encroaching
weed
from
invading
its
borders
in
spite
of
its
long
continued
proximity
across
bering
strait
and
the
aleutians
the
grass
had
jumped
gaps
thousands
of
ocean
miles
and
yet
it
had
not
bridged
that
narrow
strip
of
water
it
would
have
been
a
shock
to
these
people
had
they
known
as
i
knew
and
as
the
world
government
had
vainly
tried
to
tell
them
what
moscow
had
recently
and
reluctantly
admitted
the
grass
had
long
since
crossed
into
siberia
and
was
now
working
its
will
from
kamchatka
to
the
lena
river
the
people
of
japan
caught
between
the
jaws
of
a
closing
vise
responded
in
a
manner
peculiar
to
themselves
the
christians
now
forming
a
majority
declared
the
grass
a
punishment
for
the
sins
of
the
world
and
hoped
by
their
steadfastness
in
the
face
of
certain
death
to
earn
a
national
martyr
crown
and
thus
perhaps
redeem
those
still
benighted
the
shintoists
on
the
other
hand
agreed
the
grass
was
a
punishment
but
for
a
different
crime
had
the
doctrine
of
the
eight
corners
of
the
world
never
been
abandoned
the
japanese
would
never
have
permitted
the
grass
to
overwhelm
the
yamato
race
the
new
reign
name
saiji
they
argued
ought
not
to
mean
rule
by
the
people
as
it
was
usually
interpreted
but
rule
of
the
people
and
they
called
for
an
immediate

restoration
under
which
the
subjects
of
the
mikado
would
welcome
death
on
the
battlefield
in
a
manner
compatible
with
bushido
thus
redeeming
previous
aberrations
for
which
they
were
now
being
chastised
both
parties
agreed
that
under
no
circumstances
would
any
japanese
demean
himself
by
leaving
nippon
and
the
world
was
therefore
spared
an
additional
influx
from
these
islands
but
the
japanese
were
the
only
ones
who
refused
to
join
the
westward
stampede
plunging
the
world
daily
deeper
into
barbarism
we
in
england
had
cause
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
unique
position
the
channel
might
have
been
a
thousand
miles
wide
instead
of
twenty
the
turmoil
of
the
continent
and
of
africa
was
but
dimly
reflected
there
was
still
a
skeletal
vestige
of
trade
the
dole
kept
the
lazy
from
starvation
railways
still
functioned
on
greatly
reduced
schedules
and
the
wireless
continued
to
operate
from
good
morning
everybody
this
is
london
to
the
last
strains
of
save
the
although
i
was
constantly
rasped
by
inactivity
and
by
the
slowness
of
the
researchworkers
to
find
a
weapon
against
the
grass
i
was
happy
to
be
able
to
wait
out
this
terrible
period
in
so
ameliorative
a
spot
true
our
depots
in
the
arabian
and
sahara
deserts
were
unthreatened
by
either
the
grass
or
the
horde
but
i
should
have
found
it
uncomfortable
indeed
to
have
lived
in
either
place
in
hampshire
or
london
i
felt
myself
the
center
of
what
was
left
of
the
world
ready
to
jump
into
action
the
moment
the
great
discovery
was
finally
made
and
the
grass
began
to
recede
preblesham
my
right
hand
flew
weekly
to
africa
and
asia
minor
weeding
out
those
workers
who
threatened
to
become
useless
to
us
because
of
their
reaction
to
the
isolated
and
monotonous
conditions
at
the
depots
keeping
the
heavily
armed
guards
about
our
closed
continental
properties
alert
and
seeing
our
curtailed
activities
in
great
britain
were
judiciously
profitable
this
period
of
quiescence
suited
his
talents
perfectly
for
it
required
of
him
little
imagination
but
great
industry
and
force
i
had
noticed
for
some
time
a
slight
air
of
preoccupation
and
constraint
in
his
demeanor
during
his
reports
to
me
but
i
put
it
down
to
his
engrossment
with
our
affairs
and
resolved
to
make
him
take
an
extended
vacation
as
soon
as
he
could
be
spared
never
dreaming
of
disloyalty
from
him
i
was
shocked
then
and
deeply
wounded
when
at
the
close
of
one
of
our
conferences
he
announced
mr
weener
i
leaving
you
i
begged
him
to
tell
me
what
was
wrong
what
had
caused
him
to
come
to
this
decision
i
knew
i
said
that
he
was
overworked
and
offered
him
the
badly
needed
vacation
he
shook
his
head
it
aint
that
overwork
i
do
believe
there
is
such
a
thing
at
least
ive
never
suffered
from
it
no
mr
weener
my
trouble
is
something
no
amount
of
vacations
can
help
because
i
ca
get
away
from
a
voice
voice
tony
hallucinations
were
certainly
a
symptom
of
overwork
i
began
mentally
recalling
names
of
prominent
psychiatrists
a
voice
within
he
repeated
firmly
i
am
a
sinful
man
a
miserable
backslider
maybe
brother
paul
was
not
treading
a
true
path
i
doubt
if
he
was
or
i
would
not
have
been
led
aside
from
following
him
so
easily
but
when
i
was
doing
his
work
i
was
at
least
trying
to
do
the
will
of
god
and
not
the
will
of
another
man
no
better
spiritually
you
understand
mr
weener
spiritually
than
myself
but
now
his
voice
has
sought
me
out
again
and
i
must
once
more
take
up
the
cross
i
feel
a
call
to
go
on
a
mission
to
the
poor
heathens
and
urge
on
them
submission
to
their
father
rod
among
those
savages
across
the
channel
they
will
tear
you
limb
from
limb
christ
will
make
me
whole
again
tony
you
are
not
yourself
youre
upset
i
am
not
myself
mr
weener
i
have
become
as
a
little
child
again
and
do
my
father
bidding
i
am
upset
yes
turned
upsidedown
and
insideout
by
a
force
not
content
to
leave
men
in
wrong
attitudes
or
sinful
states
but
upset
i
stand
upright
and
go
about
my
father
business
god
bless
you
mr
weener
miss
francis
and
preblesham
at
opposite
ends
of
the
intellectual
scale
both
maundering
on
about
doing
the
will
of
god
and
general
thario
talking
about
marks
on
foreheads
what
sort
of
feebleminded
retrogressive
world
was
i
living
in
all
the
outworn
superstitions
of
religion
taking
hold
of
people
and
intruding
themselves
into
otherwise
normal
conversation
a
wave
of
madness
akin
to
the
plague
of
the
grass
must
be
sweeping
over
the
earth
was
my
conclusion
if
general
thario
desertion
had
thrown
an
extra
weight
on
my
shoulders
preblesham
burdened
me
with
all
the
petty
details
of
routine
it
was
now
i
who
had
to
inspect
our
depots
periodically
and
make
constant
trips
into
the
dangerous
regions
across
the
channel
to
see
that
the
shutdown
plants
were
being
properly
cared
for
i
resented
bitterly
the
trick
of
fate
preventing
me
from
finding
for
any
length
of
time
subordinates
to
whom
i
could
delegate
authority
nor
even
on
whom
i
could
rely
what
were
miss
francis
and
her
wellpaid
staff
doing
all
this
time
why
had
they
produced
nothing
in
return
for
the
fat
living
they
got
from
me
the
grass
was
halfway
across
asia
lapping
the
high
pamirs
from
the
south
and
from
the
north
digesting
korea
manchuria
mongolia
thrusting
runners
into
turkestan
and
still
no
progress
made
against
it
it
would
be
a
matter
of
mere
months
now
until
our
arabian
depots
would
be
in
the
danger
zone
i
could
only
conclude
these
socalled
scientists
were
little
better
than
fakers
completely
incompetent
when
confronted
by
emergency
they
were
ready
enough
to
announce
useless
and
inapplicable
discoveries
and
conclusions
byproducts
of
their
research
they
called
them
with
an
obviously
selfconscious
attempt
to
speak
the
language
of
industry
the
insects
living
in
and
below
the
grass
were
growing
ever
larger
and
more
numerous
expeditions
had
found
worms
the
size
of
snakes
and
bugs
big
as
birds
happy
in
their
environment
the
oceans
they
announced
were
drying
up
due
to
the
retention
of
moisture
in
the
soil
by
the
grass
and
added
complacently
that
in
a
million
years
or
so
assuming
the
grass
in
the
meantime
covered
the
earth
there
would
be
no
bodies
of
water
left
climates
were
equalizing
themselves
the
polar
icecaps
were
melting
and
spots
previously
too
cold
for
were
now
covered
i
felt
it
to
be
a
clear
case
of
embezzlement
that
they
had
used
my
money
paid
for
a
specific
purpose
to
make
these
useless
if
possibly
interesting
deductions
for
while
they
dawdled
and
read
learned
papers
to
each
other
the
grass
touched
the
persian
gulf
and
the
caspian
paused
before
lake
balkash
and
reached
the
yenisei
at
the
arctic
circle
far
to
the
south
it
jumped
from
india
to
the
maldives
from
the
maldives
to
the
seychelles
and
from
the
seychelles
on
to
the
great
island
of
madagascar
i
hammered
the
theme
of
time
time
at
miss
francis
but
her
only
response
was
a
helpless
sneer
at
my
impatience
at
intervals
burlet
inquired
of
me
what
progress
was
being
made
with
his
plan
for
cities
of
refuge
i
could
only
answer
him
truthfully
that
as
far
as
i
knew
the
world
government
had
it
under
consideration
but
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
sir
in
the
meantime
those
people
are
dying
quite
so
burlet
but
there
is
nothing
you
or
i
can
do
about
it
for
the
first
time
since
he
entered
my
service
i
caught
him
looking
almost
impertinently
at
me
i
faced
him
back
and
he
dropped
his
eyes
very
good
sir
thank
you
he
had
made
an
understatement
when
he
talked
about
those
people
dying
europe
was
a
madhouse
in
selfdefense
all
strangers
were
instantly
put
to
death
and
in
retaliation
the
invading
throngs
spared
no
native
peasants
feared
to
stay
their
ground
in
terror
of
the
oncoming
orientals
and
equally
dared
not
move
westward
where
certain
killing
awaited
them
at
the
hands
of
those
who
yesterday
had
been
their
neighbors
in
an
effort
to
cling
to
life
they
formed
small
bands
and
fought
impartially
both
the
static
and
dynamic
forces
farming
was
practically
abandoned
and
the
swollen
population
lived
entirely
on
wild
growth
or
upon
human
flesh
in
africa
the
situation
was
little
better
internecine
wars
and
slavery
made
their
reappearance
the
south
african
whites
mercilessly
slaughtered
the
blacks
against
a
possible
uprising
and
the
kaffirs
fleeing
northward
repeated
the
european
pattern
of
overcrowding
famine
and
pestilence
the
day
our
arabian
depots
were
abandoned
before
the
oncoming
grass
i
felt
my
heart
would
nearly
break
with
anguish
all
that
labor
all
that
forethought
all
those
precious
goods
gone
and
all
because
miss
francis
and
those
like
her
were
too
lazy
or
incompetent
to
do
the
work
for
which
they
were
paid
i
flew
to
the
spot
trying
vainly
to
salvage
something
but
lack
of
planes
and
fuel
made
it
impossible
during
this
trip
i
caught
my
first
sight
of
the
grass
for
years
i
suppose
no
human
eye
sees
anything
abstractly
but
only
in
relation
to
other
things
known
and
observed
with
more
than
half
the
world
in
its
grip
the
towering
wave
of
green
bore
no
more
resemblance
to
its
california
prototype
than
a
brontosaurus
to
the
harmless
lizard
scuttling
over
the
sunny
floor
of
an
outhouse
between
the
dirtysugar
sands
of
the
desert
and
the
oleograph
sky
it
was
a
third
band
of
brilliant
color
monstrously
outofplace
a
tidalwave
would
have
seemed
less
alien
and
awful
the
distance
was
great
enough
so
that
no
individual
part
stood
out
distinctly
instead
it
presented
itself
as
a
flat
belt
of
green
menacing
and
obdurate
as
my
plane
rose
i
looked
back
at
it
stretching
northward
southward
and
eastward
to
the
horizon
a
new
invader
in
a
land
weary
of
many
invaders
and
i
thought
of
the
dead
civilizations
it
covered
bactria
parthia
babylon
the
empire
of
lame
timur
cathay
cambodia
and
the
dominions
of
the
great
mogul
the
refuge
of
mankind
narrowed
continually
an
island
diminished
daily
by
a
lapping
surf
africa
was
thrice
beset
in
the
south
from
madagascar
in
the
center
from
the
steppingstones
in
the
indian
ocean
and
across
the
red
sea
where
the
grass
sucked
renewed
life
from
the
steaming
jungles
and
grew
with
unbelievable
rapidity
in
the
highlands
of
rhodesia
and
abyssinia
it
crept
slowly
over
the
plateaus
toward
the
slopes
of
kilimanjaro
and
the
drakensberg
unless
something
were
done
quickly
our
sahara
depots
would
go
the
way
of
the
arabian
ones
and
we
would
be
left
with
only
our
limited
british
facilities
until
the
day
when
africa
and
asia
would
be
reconquered
the
violence
and
murder
which
had
gone
before
were
tame
compared
with
the
new
fury
that
shook
the
feartortured
people
of
europe
helpless
in
the
nightmareridden
days
dreaming
through
twitching
nights
of
an
escape
geographically
nonexistent
dismembered
corpses
in
the
streets
arenas
packed
with
dead
bodies
fallow
fields
newly
fertilized
with
human
blood
added
their
stench
to
that
of
an
unwashed
disease
riddled
continent
a
rumor
was
circulated
that
there
were
still
jews
alive
and
those
who
but
yesterday
had
sought
each
other
in
mortal
combat
now
happily
united
to
hunt
down
a
common
prey
and
sure
enough
in
miserable
caverns
and
cellars
hitherto
overlooked
shunning
daylight
a
few
men
in
skullcaps
and
prayingshawls
were
found
dragged
out
into
the
disinterested
sunlight
with
their
families
and
exterminated
it
was
at
this
time
the
grass
crossed
the
urals
and
leaped
the
atlantic
into
iceland
in
england
george
bernard
shaw
whose
reported
death
some
years
before
had
been
mourned
by
those
who
had
never
read
a
word
of
his
rose
apparently
from
the
grave
to
deliver
himself
of
a
last
message
if
any
who
wept
over
my
senile
and
useless
carcass
had
taken
the
trouble
to
read
to
they
could
have
reassured
themselves
regarding
my
premature
demise
if
ever
there
was
to
be
a
longliver
that
longliver
would
have
to
be
me
this
was
determined
by
the
life
force
in
the
middle
of
the
xix
century
that
life
force
could
not
afford
to
rob
a
squinting
world
of
a
man
of
perfect
vision
like
haslam
i
forget
his
first
name
see
my
complete
works
if
you
interested
i
gave
myself
out
as
dead
in
order
to
avoid
the
gawking
of
a
curious
and
idle
multitude
i
was
recuperating
from
the
labors
of
my
first
century
in
order
to
throw
myself
into
the
more
arduous
ones
of
the
second
but
as
i
have
pointed
out
so
many
times
the
race
was
between
maturity
and
the
petulant
of
protracted
adolescence
mankind
had
either
to
take
thought
or
to
perish
and
it
has
chosen
perhaps
sensibly
after
all
to
perish
i
am
too
old
now
to
protest
against
selfindulgence
is
it
too
late
is
it
still
possible
to
survive
the
ship
is
now
indeed
upon
the
rocks
and
the
skipper
in
his
bunk
below
drinking
bottled
ditchwater
but
perhaps
a
captain
shotover
drunk
on
the
milk
of
human
kindness
rather
than
rum
will
emerge
upon
the
quarterdeck
and
blowing
his
whistle
call
all
hands
on
deck
before
the
last
rending
crash
in
that
unlikely
event
one
of
those
emerging
from
the
forecastle
will
be
bernard
shaw
in
spite
of
the
anarchic
and
unspeakable
conditions
on
the
continent
i
could
not
refrain
from
making
one
last
tour
of
inspection
the
thought
of
flooded
mines
pillaged
factories
and
gutted
mills
was
more
than
i
could
bear
the
stocks
of
oil
in
england
were
running
short
but
i
commanded
enough
to
fill
my
great
transportplane
we
flew
low
over
roads
crawling
with
humanity
as
a
sick
animal
crawls
with
vermin
some
cities
were
empty
obscenely
bereft
of
population
others
choked
with
wanderers
the
ruhr
was
a
valley
filled
with
the
dead
with
men
tearing
each
other
throats
in
a
frenzy
of
hunger
with
the
unburied
and
the
soon
to
be
buried
sleeping
sidebyside
through
restless
nights
not
a
building
was
still
whole
what
had
not
been
torn
down
in
pointless
rage
had
been
razed
by
reasonless
arson
not
one
brick
of
the
great
openhearths
had
been
left
in
place
not
one
girder
of
the
great
sheds
remained
erect
the
saar
was
in
little
better
case
and
the
mines
of
alsace
were
useless
for
the
next
quartercentury
the
industrial
district
around
paris
had
been
leveled
to
the
ground
by
the
mobs
and
belgium
looked
as
it
had
after
the
worst
devastation
of
war
i
had
expected
to
find
a
shambles
but
my
utmost
anticipations
were
exceeded
i
could
bring
myself
to
look
upon
no
more
and
my
pilot
informing
me
that
our
gas
was
low
i
ordered
him
to
return
we
were
in
sight
of
the
channel
not
far
from
calais
when
both
starboard
engines
developed
trouble
simultaneously
and
my
pilot
headed
for
a
landingfield
below
what
are
you
about
you
fool
i
shouted
at
him
gasline
fouled
i
think
i
can
fix
it
in
a
few
minutes
mr
weener
not
down
among
those
savages
we
wouldnt
have
a
chance
we
wouldnt
have
a
chance
over
the
channel
sir
i
rather
risk
my
neck
among
fellow
humans
than
in
the
water
maybe
you
would
but
i
wouldnt
straighten
out
the
plane
and
go
on
sorry
mr
weener
i
going
to
have
to
land
here
and
in
spite
of
my
protests
he
did
so
i
was
instantly
proved
right
for
before
we
came
to
a
stop
we
were
surrounded
by
an
assortment
of
filthy
and
emaciated
men
and
women
bearing
scythes
and
pitchforks
shouting
yelling
and
gesticulating
making
in
fact
such
an
uproar
that
no
comprehension
was
possible
however
there
was
no
misunderstanding
their
brusque
motions
ordering
us
away
from
the
plane
or
the
threatening
noises
which
reinforced
the
command
no
sooner
had
we
reluctantly
complied
than
they
proceeded
methodically
to
puncture
the
tires
and
smash
the
propellers
my
horror
at
this
marooning
among
the
degenerates
was
not
lessened
by
their
ugly
and
illdisposed
looks
and
i
feared
they
would
not
be
content
with
smashing
the
plane
but
would
take
out
their
animus
against
those
who
had
not
sunk
into
their
own
bestial
state
by
destroying
us
as
well
since
i
do
not
speak
much
french
i
could
only
say
to
the
man
nearest
me
a
sinister
fellow
in
a
blue
smock
with
a
brown
stockingcap
on
his
head
un
disgrace
ça
je
demandez
le
pourquoi
he
looked
at
me
for
a
baffled
moment
before
calling
jean
jean
jean
was
even
more
illfavored
having
a
scar
across
his
mouth
which
gave
him
an
artificial
harelip
however
he
spoke
english
of
a
kind
your
airship
has
been
confiscated
citizen
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
that
plane
is
my
personal
property
there
is
no
personal
property
in
the
republic
one
and
indivisible
replied
jean
be
thankful
your
life
is
spared
citizen
englishman
and
go
without
further
argumentations
i
suppose
it
was
reasonable
to
take
this
advice
but
i
could
not
resist
informing
him
i
am
not
an
englishman
but
an
american
we
also
had
a
republic
one
and
indivisible
he
shook
his
head
on
your
ways
citizen
the
republic
does
not
make
distinctions
between
one
bourgeois
and
another
i
looked
around
for
the
pilot
but
he
had
vanished
alone
furious
at
the
act
of
robbery
and
not
a
little
apprehensive
i
began
walking
toward
the
coast
but
i
was
not
steeled
against
isolation
among
the
barbarians
of
the
continent
nor
dressed
for
such
an
excursion
between
anxiety
lest
i
run
into
a
less
pompous
and
more
bloodthirsty
group
of
representatives
of
the
republic
one
and
indivisible
when
it
had
come
into
being
how
far
its
authority
extended
or
how
long
it
lasted
i
never
learned
and
the
burning
and
blistering
of
my
feet
in
their
thinsoled
shoes
i
doubt
if
i
was
more
than
a
few
miles
from
the
airfield
and
therefore
many
from
the
coast
when
darkness
fell
i
kept
on
tired
anxious
hungry
in
no
better
plight
than
thousands
of
other
wretches
who
at
the
same
moment
were
heading
the
same
way
under
identical
conditions
the
only
advantage
of
traveling
by
night
was
the
removal
of
my
fear
of
the
intentions
of
men
but
nature
made
up
for
this
by
putting
her
own
obstacles
in
my
way
the
hedgerows
which
had
been
allowed
to
grow
wild
the
unrepaired
roadways
sunken
and
marked
by
deep
holes
and
ruts
and
a
hundred
other
pitfalls
made
my
progress
agonizingly
slow
as
the
moon
rose
i
had
a
sudden
feeling
of
being
near
water
and
coming
out
from
a
thicket
i
was
confirmed
in
this
by
seeing
the
light
break
into
ripples
on
an
uneven
surface
but
tragically
it
was
not
the
channel
i
had
come
upon
merely
a
river
too
wide
to
cross
which
though
it
undoubtedly
led
to
my
goal
would
increase
the
length
of
my
journey
by
many
miles
i
afraid
i
gave
way
to
a
quite
unmanly
weakness
as
i
threw
myself
upon
the
hard
ground
and
thought
of
my
miserable
fate
i
may
have
lain
there
for
ten
minutes
or
twenty
the
moon
went
behind
a
cloud
the
air
grew
chilly
i
was
nerving
myself
to
get
up
and
resume
my
journey
though
to
what
purpose
i
could
not
conceive
for
i
would
be
little
better
off
on
a
norman
beach
than
inland
when
a
timid
hand
was
put
upon
my
shoulder
and
someone
said
questioningly
angleterre
i
sprang
up
england
oh
yes
england
can
you
help
me
get
there
the
moon
stayed
covered
and
i
could
not
see
his
face
in
the
dark
england
he
said
yes
i
take
you
i
followed
him
to
a
little
backwater
where
was
beached
a
rowboat
even
by
feel
in
the
blackness
it
seemed
to
me
a
very
small
and
frail
craft
to
chance
the
voyage
across
the
choppy
sea
but
i
had
no
choice
i
seated
myself
in
the
stern
while
he
took
the
oars
cast
off
and
rowed
us
down
the
river
toward
the
estuary
i
decided
he
must
be
one
of
that
company
of
smugglers
who
were
ferrying
refugees
into
britain
despite
the
strictest
watch
no
doubt
he
thinks
to
make
a
pretty
penny
for
tonight
work
i
thought
but
no
coastguard
would
turn
back
albert
weener
i
would
pay
him
well
for
his
help
but
he
could
not
blackmail
me
for
fabulous
ransom
still
the
moon
did
not
come
out
my
eyes
accustoming
themselves
to
the
dark
vaguely
discerned
the
shape
opposite
me
and
i
saw
he
was
a
short
man
but
beyond
this
i
could
not
distinguish
his
features
the
river
broadened
the
air
became
salty
the
wind
rose
and
soon
the
little
boat
was
bobbing
up
and
down
in
a
manner
to
give
discomfort
to
my
stomach
the
water
building
terraces
and
battlements
reflected
enough
light
to
impress
me
with
the
diminutiveness
of
the
boat
set
in
the
vastness
on
which
it
floated
behind
us
the
french
coast
was
a
looming
mass
then
a
thick
blob
finally
a
thin
blur
hardly
perceptible
to
strained
eyes
i
was
thoroughly
seasick
retching
and
vomiting
over
the
narrow
freeboard
steadily
and
rhythmically
the
man
rowed
with
tireless
arms
apparently
unaffected
by
the
boat
leaping
and
dropping
in
response
to
the
impulse
of
the
waves
and
in
my
intervals
of
relief
from
nausea
i
reflected
that
he
must
have
gained
plenty
of
practice
that
he
was
an
old
hand
in
making
this
trip
it
was
a
peculiar
way
to
gain
wealth
i
thought
caught
in
another
spasm
of
sickness
enriching
oneself
on
the
misery
of
others
i
vomited
and
dozed
dozed
and
vomited
the
night
was
endless
the
wind
was
bitter
what
riches
i
wondered
could
compensate
a
man
for
such
hardships
by
the
time
the
wanderers
got
to
the
channel
they
could
not
very
well
have
much
left
and
unless
my
smuggler
were
gifted
with
secondsight
he
could
not
know
judging
by
the
way
he
had
accosted
me
whether
he
was
carrying
a
man
who
could
pay
or
for
the
accommodation
well
i
philosophized
it
takes
all
kinds
to
make
a
world
and
who
am
i
to
say
this
illicit
trafficker
isnt
doing
as
much
good
in
his
way
as
i
in
mine
i
do
know
when
my
nausea
finally
left
me
unless
it
was
after
nothing
whatever
remained
in
my
stomach
i
sat
limp
and
cold
conscious
only
of
the
erratic
bobbing
of
the
little
vessel
and
the
ceaseless
rhythm
of
the
oars
at
last
unbelievably
the
sky
turned
from
black
to
gray
i
could
not
believe
it
anything
but
an
optical
illusion
in
the
endless
night
and
i
strained
to
dissipate
whatever
biliousness
was
affecting
my
vision
but
it
was
dawn
sure
enough
and
soon
it
revealed
the
pettish
wallowing
channel
and
the
fragile
outline
of
our
boat
even
tinier
than
i
had
conceived
i
shuddered
with
more
than
cold
had
i
known
what
a
cockleshell
it
was
i
might
have
paused
before
trusting
my
life
so
readily
to
it
line
by
line
the
increasing
light
drew
the
countenance
of
my
guide
at
first
he
was
nothing
but
a
shape
well
muffled
with
some
kind
of
flat
cap
upon
his
head
a
little
more
light
revealed
a
glittering
eye
more
a
great
hooked
nose
with
wide
nostrils
he
was
a
man
of
uncertain
age
bordering
upon
the
elderly
with
a
black
skullcap
under
which
curled
outward
two
silverygray
horns
of
hair
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
covered
with
a
grizzled
beard
he
must
have
been
studying
me
as
intently
for
he
now
broke
the
silence
which
had
prevailed
all
night
you
are
not
a
poor
man
he
announced
accusingly
how
is
it
you
have
waited
so
long
i
afraid
youve
made
a
mistake
in
me
my
friend
i
told
him
jovially
we
sha
be
making
an
illegal
entry
i
am
resident
in
england
and
can
come
home
at
any
time
he
was
silent
from
disappointment
i
concluded
never
mind
i
pay
you
as
much
as
a
refugee
within
reason
you
are
a
follower
of
reason
sir
i
tried
hard
to
make
out
more
of
his
still
obscured
face
for
there
was
a
note
of
irony
in
his
voice
i
believe
we
all
be
better
off
if
everyone
were
to
accept
things
philosophically
responsible
people
will
find
a
way
to
end
our
troubles
eventually
and
in
the
meantime
madness
and
violence
i
waved
my
hand
to
the
french
coast
behind
do
help
at
all
ah
he
said
without
pausing
in
his
rowing
men
alone
then
will
solve
man
problem
who
else
who
else
indeed
the
smuggler
answer
or
confirmation
or
whatever
the
equivocal
echo
was
irritated
me
you
think
our
problems
can
be
solved
from
the
outside
he
managed
to
shrug
his
shoulders
without
breaking
the
rhythm
of
his
arms
perhaps
my
english
is
unequal
to
understanding
what
you
mean
by
outside
all
the
forces
i
know
are
represented
within
i
was
baffled
and
switched
the
subject
to
more
immediate
themes
are
we
about
halfway
do
you
think
the
light
now
exposed
him
fully
his
hands
were
small
and
i
doubted
if
the
arms
extending
from
them
were
muscular
but
he
radiated
an
air
of
great
vitality
his
face
was
lined
his
eyes
fierce
under
outthrust
eyebrows
his
lips
where
the
crisp
waves
of
his
beard
permitted
them
to
show
stern
but
his
whole
demeanor
was
not
unkindly
it
is
easy
to
measure
how
far
we
have
come
but
who
can
say
how
far
we
have
to
go
this
metaphysical
doubletalk
annoyed
me
i
do
know
what
is
happening
to
people
i
said
either
they
act
like
those
over
there
i
gestured
toward
the
republic
one
and
indivisible
or
else
they
become
mystics
you
find
questions
without
immediate
answers
mystical
sir
i
like
my
questions
to
be
susceptible
to
an
answer
of
some
kind
you
are
a
man
of
thought
it
amused
me
to
speak
intimately
to
this
stranger
i
have
lived
inside
myself
a
great
many
years
naturally
my
mind
has
not
been
idle
all
the
while
you
have
not
married
i
never
had
the
time
ah
he
rowed
quietly
for
some
moments
had
the
time
he
repeated
thoughtfully
you
think
marriage
is
important
a
man
without
children
disowns
his
parents
sounds
like
a
proverb
it
is
not
just
an
observation
i
suppose
since
you
have
not
had
the
time
to
marry
you
have
devoted
your
life
to
good
works
i
have
given
employment
to
many
and
help
to
the
pauperized
it
is
commanded
to
be
charitable
i
have
given
millions
of
dollars
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
to
philanthropies
anonymously
of
course
you
must
be
a
godly
man
sir
i
am
an
agnostic
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
such
a
thing
he
shook
his
head
beneath
us
there
are
fish
who
do
not
know
it
is
the
sea
in
which
they
swim
above
us
there
are
birds
unaware
of
the
reaches
of
the
sky
the
fish
have
no
conception
of
sky
the
birds
know
nothing
of
the
deep
they
are
agnostics
also
well
it
doesnt
seem
to
do
them
any
harm
fishes
continue
to
spawn
and
birds
to
nest
without
the
benefits
of
esoteric
knowledge
exactly
fish
remain
fish
in
happy
ignorance
doubt
does
not
cause
a
bird
to
falter
in
its
flight
the
sun
was
pushed
into
the
air
from
the
waters
as
a
ball
is
pushed
by
the
thumb
and
forefinger
the
chalkcliffs
were
outlined
ahead
of
me
and
i
calculated
we
had
little
more
than
an
hour
to
go
you
have
chosen
a
strange
way
of
earning
a
living
my
friend
i
ventured
at
last
upon
some
is
laid
the
yoke
of
the
law
others
depend
upon
the
sun
for
light
he
said
perhaps
like
yourself
i
have
committed
some
great
sin
and
am
expiating
it
in
this
manner
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
am
conscious
of
no
sin
if
i
understand
the
meaning
of
the
theological
term
have
trespassed
he
murmured
dreamily
have
been
faithless
we
have
robbed
we
have
spoken
basely
we
have
committed
iniquity
we
have
wrought
unrighteousness
since
the
rational
world
discarded
the
superstitions
of
religion
halfacentury
ago
i
said
we
have
learned
that
good
and
evil
are
relative
terms
without
meaning
actually
for
the
first
time
he
suspended
his
oars
and
the
boat
wallowed
crazily
excuse
me
he
resumed
his
exertions
good
is
evil
sometimes
and
evil
is
good
upon
occasion
it
depends
on
circumstances
and
the
point
of
view
what
is
beneficial
at
one
time
and
place
may
be
detrimental
under
other
circumstances
ah
green
is
green
today
but
it
was
yellow
yesterday
and
will
be
blue
tomorrow
even
such
an
exaggeration
could
be
defended
however
that
was
not
my
meaning
have
wrought
unrighteousness
we
have
been
presumptuous
we
have
done
violence
we
have
forged
lies
we
have
counseled
evil
we
have
lied
we
have
scoffed
we
have
revolted
we
have
blasphemed
we
have
been
rebellious
we
have
acted
perversely
we
have
transgressed
we
have
persecuted
perhaps
you
have
i
interrupted
with
some
asperity
but
i
belong
in
that
category
far
from
persecuting
i
have
always
believed
in
tolerance
live
and
let
live
i
always
say
people
ca
help
the
color
of
their
skins
or
the
race
they
were
born
into
and
if
they
could
they
would
naturally
choose
to
be
white
northeuropean
gentiles
why
should
anyone
voluntarily
embrace
a
status
of
inconvenience
why
indeed
have
persecuted
we
have
been
stiffnecked
we
have
done
wickedly
we
have
corrupted
ourselves
we
have
committed
abominations
we
have
gone
astray
and
we
have
led
astray
we
both
fell
silent
after
this
catalogue
quite
inapplicable
to
the
situation
and
it
was
with
heartfelt
thanks
i
distinguished
each
fault
and
seam
in
the
dover
cliffs
as
well
as
the
breaking
line
of
surf
below
i
presumed
because
of
what
i
said
about
legal
entry
he
was
not
avoiding
the
coastguard
but
with
a
practiced
oar
he
suddenly
veered
and
drove
us
onto
a
minute
sandy
beach
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
obviously
unfrequented
and
probably
unknown
to
officialdom
a
narrow
yet
clearly
defined
path
led
upward
this
was
evidently
his
customary
haven
were
i
an
emotional
man
i
would
have
kissed
the
little
strip
of
shingle
as
it
was
i
contented
myself
with
a
deep
sigh
of
thanksgiving
my
guide
stood
on
the
sand
smoothing
the
long
shapeless
garment
he
wore
against
his
spare
body
he
had
taken
a
small
book
from
his
pocket
and
was
mumbling
some
unintelligible
words
aloud
i
was
struck
again
by
the
nervous
vigor
of
the
man
which
had
given
him
the
strength
to
row
all
night
against
a
harsh
sea
and
presumably
would
generate
the
energy
necessary
for
the
return
trip
i
pulled
out
my
wallet
and
extracted
two
banknotes
no
one
could
say
albert
weener
didnt
reward
service
handsomely
here
you
are
my
friend
i
said
and
thank
you
i
accept
your
thanks
he
bowed
slightly
putting
his
hands
behind
him
and
moving
toward
his
boat
perversely
since
he
seemed
bent
on
rejecting
my
reward
i
became
anxious
to
press
it
upon
him
do
be
foolish
i
argued
this
is
a
perilous
game
this
running
in
of
refugees
you
ca
do
it
for
pleasure
it
is
a
work
of
charity
i
do
know
how
this
shabby
fellow
conceived
charity
but
i
had
never
understood
that
virtue
to
conflict
with
the
law
you
mean
you
ferry
all
these
strays
for
nothing
my
payment
is
predetermined
and
exact
you
are
foolish
anyone
using
your
boat
for
illegal
entry
would
be
glad
to
give
everything
he
possessed
for
the
trip
there
are
many
penniless
ones
need
that
be
your
concern
to
the
extent
of
risking
your
life
and
devoting
all
your
time
i
can
speak
for
no
one
but
myself
it
need
be
my
concern
one
man
ca
do
much
oh
do
think
i
do
sympathize
with
your
attitude
i
too
pity
these
poor
people
deeply
i
have
given
thousands
of
pounds
to
relieve
them
their
plight
touches
your
heart
indeed
it
does
never
in
all
history
have
so
many
been
so
wretched
through
no
fault
of
their
own
ah
he
agreed
thoughtfully
for
you
it
is
something
strange
and
pathetic
tragic
would
be
a
better
word
but
for
us
it
is
an
old
story
he
pushed
his
boat
into
the
water
an
old
story
he
repeated
wait
wait
the
money
he
jumped
in
and
began
rowing
i
waved
the
banknotes
ridiculously
in
the
air
his
body
bent
backward
and
forward
urging
the
boat
away
from
me
with
each
pull
your
money
i
yelled
he
moved
steadily
toward
the
french
shore
i
watched
him
recede
into
the
channel
mists
and
thought
another
madman
i
turned
away
at
last
and
began
to
ascend
the
path
up
the
cliff
when
i
finally
got
back
to
hampshire
worn
out
by
my
ordeal
and
feeling
as
though
i
aged
ten
years
there
was
a
message
from
miss
francis
on
my
desk
even
her
bumptious
rudeness
could
not
conceal
the
jubilation
with
which
she
penned
it
to
assuage
your
natural
fear
for
the
continued
safety
of
albert
weener
invaluable
person
i
hasten
to
inform
you
that
i
believe
i
have
a
workable
compound
it
may
be
a
mere
matter
of
weeks
now
before
we
shall
begin
to
roll
back
six
weener
sees
it
whether
it
was
from
the
exposure
i
endured
on
that
dreadful
trip
or
from
disease
germs
which
must
have
been
plentiful
among
the
continental
savages
and
the
man
who
rowed
me
back
to
england
i
know
but
that
night
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
chill
an
aching
head
and
a
dry
enervating
fever
i
sent
for
the
doctor
and
went
to
bed
and
it
was
a
week
before
i
was
myself
enough
to
be
cognizant
of
what
was
going
on
around
me
during
my
illness
i
was
delirious
and
i
sure
i
afforded
my
nurses
plentiful
occasion
to
snicker
at
the
ravings
of
someone
of
no
inconsiderable
importance
as
he
lay
helpless
and
sick
paper
and
pencil
you
kep
callin
for
mr
weener
an
you
that
elpless
you
couldnt
old
up
your
own
and
you
said
you
ad
to
write
a
book
the
istory
of
the
grass
to
purge
yourself
you
said
lor
mr
weener
doctors
prescribe
purges
no
more
that
went
out
before
the
first
war
i
never
had
a
great
deal
of
patience
with
theories
of
psychology
they
seem
to
smack
too
much
of
the
confessional
and
the
catechism
but
as
i
understand
it
it
is
claimed
that
there
exists
what
is
called
an
unconscious
a
reservoir
of
all
sorts
of
thoughts
lurking
behind
the
conscious
mind
the
desires
of
this
unconscious
are
powerful
and
tend
to
be
expressed
any
time
the
conscious
mind
is
offguard
whether
this
metaphysical
construction
be
valid
or
not
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
such
thing
had
taken
place
while
i
was
sick
and
my
unconscious
or
whatever
it
was
had
outlined
a
very
sensible
project
there
was
no
reason
why
i
shouldnt
write
such
a
history
as
soon
as
i
could
take
the
time
from
my
affairs
certainly
i
had
the
talent
for
it
and
i
believed
it
would
give
me
some
satisfaction
my
pleasant
speculations
and
plans
for
this
literary
venture
were
interrupted
as
was
my
convalescence
by
the
loss
of
the
sahara
depots
when
i
got
the
news
my
principal
concern
wasnt
for
the
incalculable
damage
to
consolidated
pemmican
my
initial
reaction
was
amazement
at
the
ability
of
the
devilgrass
to
make
its
way
so
rapidly
across
a
sterile
and
waterless
waste
in
the
years
since
its
first
appearance
it
had
truly
adapted
itself
to
any
climate
altitude
or
condition
confronting
it
a
few
months
before
the
catastrophe
would
have
plunged
me
into
profound
depression
now
with
the
resilience
of
recovery
added
to
miss
francis
assurance
it
became
merely
another
setback
soon
to
be
redeemed
from
senegal
near
the
middle
of
the
great
african
bulge
to
tunis
at
the
continent
northern
edge
up
through
sardinia
and
corsica
the
latest
front
of
the
grass
was
arrayed
it
occupied
most
of
italy
and
climbed
the
alps
to
bite
the
eastern
tip
from
switzerland
it
took
bavaria
and
the
rest
of
germany
beyond
the
weser
only
the
netherlands
belgium
france
spain
and
portugal
a
geographical
purist
might
have
added
luxembourg
andorra
and
monaco
remained
untouched
upon
the
continent
into
this
insignificant
territory
and
the
british
isles
were
packed
all
that
was
left
of
the
world
two
billion
people
a
blinded
starving
mob
driven
mad
by
terror
how
many
there
were
there
squirming
struggling
dying
in
a
desperate
unwillingness
to
give
up
existence
no
matter
how
intolerable
no
one
could
calculate
any
more
than
a
census
could
be
taken
of
the
numbers
buried
beneath
the
grass
now
holding
untroubled
sway
over
ninetenths
of
the
globe
watchers
were
set
upon
the
english
coast
in
a
manner
reminiscent
of
i
do
know
exactly
what
value
the
giving
of
the
alarm
would
have
been
nevertheless
night
and
day
eyes
were
strained
through
binoculars
and
telescopes
for
signs
of
the
unique
green
on
the
horizon
or
the
first
seed
slipping
through
to
find
a
home
on
insular
soil
miss
francis
optimistic
news
had
been
communicated
to
the
authorities
but
not
given
out
over
the
bbc
this
was
an
obvious
precaution
against
a
wave
of
concerted
invasion
by
the
fear
obsessed
horde
beyond
the
channel
while
they
might
respect
our
barriers
if
the
hope
for
survival
was
dim
a
chance
pickup
of
the
news
that
the
grass
was
doomed
would
be
sure
to
send
its
destined
victims
frenziedly
seeking
a
refuge
until
the
consummation
occurred
if
such
a
thing
happened
our
tiny
islands
would
be
suffocated
by
refugees
our
stores
would
not
last
a
week
and
we
should
all
go
down
to
destruction
together
but
in
the
mysterious
way
of
rumor
the
news
spread
to
hearten
the
islanders
they
had
always
been
determined
to
fight
the
grass
if
necessary
as
the
chinese
had
fought
it
till
overwhelmed
indeed
what
other
course
had
they
but
now
their
need
was
only
to
hold
it
at
bay
until
the
new
discovery
could
be
implemented
and
there
was
good
chance
of
its
being
put
to
use
before
the
grass
had
got
far
beyond
the
rhine
now
we
were
on
the
last
lap
my
interest
in
the
progress
of
the
scientific
tests
was
such
that
i
insisted
upon
being
present
at
every
field
experiment
for
some
reason
miss
francis
didnt
care
for
this
and
tried
to
dissuade
me
both
by
her
disagreeable
manner
her
eccentricity
craziness
would
undoubtedly
be
a
more
accurate
term
increased
daily
and
by
her
assurances
i
couldnt
possibly
find
anything
to
hold
my
attention
there
but
of
course
i
overruled
her
and
didnt
miss
a
single
one
of
these
fascinating
if
sometimes
disappointing
trials
i
vividly
recall
the
first
one
she
had
reiterated
there
would
be
nothing
worth
watching
even
at
best
no
spectacular
results
were
expected
but
i
made
myself
one
of
the
party
just
the
same
the
theater
was
a
particularly
dismal
part
of
dartmoor
and
for
some
reason
probably
known
only
to
herself
she
had
chosen
dawn
for
the
time
we
arrived
cold
and
uncomfortable
in
two
saloon
cars
the
second
one
holding
several
long
cylinders
similar
to
the
oxygen
or
acetylene
tanks
commonly
used
in
american
industry
there
was
a
great
deal
of
mysterious
consultation
between
miss
francis
and
her
assistants
punctuated
by
ritualistic
samplings
of
the
vegetation
and
soil
when
these
ceremonies
were
complete
four
stakes
and
a
wooden
mallet
were
produced
and
the
corners
of
a
square
about
by
were
pegged
the
cylinders
were
unloaded
set
in
place
at
equal
intervals
along
one
side
of
the
square
turncocks
and
nozzles
with
elongated
sprayjets
attached
and
the
valves
opened
a
fine
mist
issued
forth
settling
gently
over
the
stakedout
area
miss
francis
her
toothpick
suspended
stood
in
rapt
contemplation
at
the
end
of
thirty
minutes
the
spray
was
turned
off
and
the
containers
rolled
back
into
the
car
except
for
the
artificial
dew
upon
it
the
moor
looked
exactly
as
it
had
before
well
weener
are
you
going
to
stand
there
and
gawk
for
the
next
twentyfour
hours
or
are
you
coming
back
with
us
i
could
tell
by
their
expressions
how
horrified
her
assistants
were
at
the
rudeness
to
which
i
become
so
accustomed
i
no
longer
noticed
it
it
not
a
success
then
i
asked
how
the
devil
do
i
know
i
have
no
crystal
ball
to
show
me
tomorrow
anyway
even
if
it
works
on
the
miscellaneous
growth
here
i
havent
the
remotest
idea
how
the
grass
will
react
to
it
this
is
only
a
remote
preliminary
as
i
told
you
before
and
why
you
encumbered
us
with
your
inquisitiveness
is
more
than
i
can
see
youre
coming
back
tomorrow
then
naturally
did
you
think
i
just
put
this
on
for
fun
in
order
to
go
away
and
forget
it
weener
i
always
knew
those
who
made
money
werent
particularly
brilliant
but
arent
you
a
little
backward
even
for
a
billionaire
there
was
no
doubt
she
indulged
in
these
boorish
discourtesies
simply
to
buoy
up
her
own
ego
which
must
have
suffered
greatly
she
presumed
on
her
sex
and
my
tolerance
taking
the
same
pleasure
in
baiting
me
on
whom
she
was
utterly
dependent
as
a
terrier
does
in
annoying
a
saint
bernard
knowing
the
big
dog
chivalry
will
protect
the
pest
when
we
returned
the
square
was
clean
of
all
growth
as
though
scraped
with
a
sharp
knife
only
traces
of
powdery
dust
not
yet
scattered
by
a
breeze
lay
here
and
there
i
was
jubilant
but
miss
francis
affected
an
air
of
contempt
ive
proved
nothing
i
didnt
know
before
merely
confirmed
the
powers
of
the
deterrent
under
optimum
conditions
it
has
killed
ordinary
grass
and
some
miscellaneous
weeds
and
that
all
i
can
say
so
far
what
it
will
do
to
inoculated
i
have
no
more
idea
than
you
but
youre
going
to
try
it
on
the
grass
immediately
no
i
not
she
answered
shortly
why
not
weener
either
leave
these
things
in
my
hands
or
else
go
do
them
yourself
you
annoy
me
i
was
not
to
be
put
off
in
so
cavalier
a
manner
and
after
we
parted
i
sent
for
one
of
her
assistants
and
ordered
him
to
load
a
plane
with
some
of
the
cylinders
and
fly
to
the
continent
for
the
purpose
of
using
the
stuff
directly
against
the
grass
when
he
protested
such
a
test
would
be
quite
useless
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
such
disloyalty
to
his
chief
as
he
quaintly
called
miss
francis
i
had
to
threaten
him
with
instant
discharge
and
blacklist
before
he
came
to
his
senses
i
sorry
to
say
he
turned
out
to
be
a
completely
unreliable
young
man
for
the
plane
and
its
crew
were
never
heard
from
again
a
loss
i
felt
deeply
for
planes
were
becoming
scarce
in
england
as
a
matter
of
fact
everything
except
illegal
entrants
who
continued
to
evade
the
authorities
was
becoming
scarce
in
england
now
the
stocks
of
petroleum
acquired
from
the
last
untouched
wells
and
refineries
and
hoarded
so
zealously
had
been
limited
by
the
storage
space
available
we
had
a
tremendous
amount
of
food
on
hand
yet
with
our
abnormally
swollen
population
and
the
constant
knowledge
that
the
british
isles
were
not
agriculturally
selfsufficient
wartime
rationing
of
the
utmost
stringency
was
resorted
to
the
people
accepted
their
hardships
lightened
by
the
hope
given
by
miss
francis
work
in
turn
made
possible
only
by
me
though
i
chafed
at
her
procrastination
and
forced
myself
to
swallow
her
incivilities
i
put
my
personal
reactions
aside
and
with
hardly
an
exception
turned
over
my
entire
scientific
resources
to
miss
francis
making
all
my
research
laboratories
subordinate
to
her
subject
only
to
a
prudent
check
exercised
by
a
governing
board
of
practical
businessmen
the
government
cooperated
wholeheartedly
and
thousands
worked
night
and
day
devising
possible
variants
of
the
basic
compound
and
means
of
applying
it
under
all
conditions
it
was
a
race
between
the
grass
and
the
conquerors
of
the
grass
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
outcome
the
only
question
now
was
how
far
the
grass
would
get
before
it
was
finally
stopped
the
second
experiment
was
carried
out
on
the
south
downs
the
containers
were
the
same
the
ceremonious
interchange
repeated
only
the
area
staked
out
covered
about
four
times
as
much
ground
as
the
first
we
departed
as
before
leaving
the
meadow
apparently
unharmed
returning
to
find
the
square
dead
and
wasted
once
more
i
urged
her
to
turn
the
compound
directly
upon
the
grass
what
if
it
isnt
perfected
what
harm
can
it
do
maybe
it
advanced
enough
to
halt
the
grass
even
if
it
doesnt
kill
it
she
stabbed
at
her
chest
with
the
toothpick
isnt
it
horrible
to
live
in
a
world
of
intellectual
sucklings
how
can
i
explain
what
going
on
i
have
a
basic
compound
in
the
same
sense
in
the
same
sense
let
us
say
that
i
know
iodine
to
be
a
poison
yes
that
will
do
if
i
wish
to
kill
a
man
some
millionaire
and
administer
too
little
far
from
acting
as
a
poison
it
will
be
positively
beneficial
this
is
a
miserably
oversimplified
analogy
perhaps
you
will
understand
it
i
was
extremely
dissatisfied
knowing
as
i
did
the
rapidly
worsening
situation
the
grass
was
in
the
iberian
peninsula
in
provence
burgundy
lorraine
champagne
and
holland
the
people
were
restive
no
longer
appeased
by
the
tentative
promise
of
redemption
through
miss
francis
efforts
the
bbc
named
a
date
for
the
first
attack
upon
the
grass
contradicted
itself
said
sensible
men
would
understand
these
matters
couldnt
be
pinned
down
to
hours
and
minutes
there
were
riots
at
clydeside
and
in
south
wales
and
i
feared
the
looting
of
my
warehouses
in
view
of
the
terrible
scarcity
of
food
it
wasnt
only
the
immediate
situation
which
was
bad
but
the
longrange
one
oil
reserves
in
the
united
kingdom
were
practically
exhausted
so
were
metals
vital
machinery
needed
immediate
replacement
as
soon
as
miss
francis
was
ready
to
go
into
action
the
strain
upon
our
obsolescent
technology
and
hungerweakened
manpower
would
be
crippling
the
general
mood
was
not
lightened
by
the
clergy
professionally
gloating
over
approaching
doom
nor
by
the
speculations
of
the
scientists
who
were
now
predicting
an
insect
and
aquatic
world
man
they
said
could
not
adapt
himself
to
the
grass
this
was
proved
to
the
hilt
by
the
tragedy
of
the
russian
armies
in
the
last
war
but
insects
had
fishes
didnt
need
to
and
birds
especially
those
who
nested
above
the
snowline
might
possibly
be
able
to
undoubtedly
these
orders
could
in
time
produce
a
creature
equal
if
not
superior
to
and
the
march
of
progress
stood
a
chance
to
continue
after
an
hiatus
of
a
few
million
years
or
so
the
combination
of
these
airy
and
abstract
speculations
with
their
slowness
to
produce
something
tangible
to
help
us
at
this
crisis
first
angered
and
then
profoundly
depressed
me
i
could
only
look
upon
the
whole
conglomeration
scientists
politicians
common
man
and
all
as
thoroughly
irresponsible
i
remembered
how
i
had
applied
myself
diligently
toiling
planning
imagining
to
reach
my
present
position
and
how
a
fraction
of
that
effort
if
it
had
been
exerted
by
these
people
could
stop
the
grass
overnight
in
this
frameofmind
my
thoughts
occupied
themselves
more
and
more
with
the
idea
i
had
uttered
during
my
illness
to
write
a
history
of
the
grass
would
at
least
afford
me
an
escape
from
the
daily
irritation
of
concerning
myself
exclusively
with
the
incompetents
and
blunderers
not
being
the
type
of
person
to
undertake
anything
i
was
not
prepared
to
finish
i
thought
it
might
be
advisable
to
keep
a
journal
first
to
get
myself
in
the
mood
for
the
larger
work
and
later
to
have
a
daytoday
account
of
momentous
events
as
seen

connected

lunch
at
chequers
with
the
pm
very
gloomy
says
miss
f
may
have
to
be
nationalized
feeble
joke
by
undersecretary
about
nationalization
of
women
proving
unsuccessful
during
the
bolshevik
revolution
ignoring
this
assured
the
pm
we
would
get
a
more
definite
date
from
her
during
the
week
privately
agreed
her
dilatoriness
unpardonable
i
shall
speak
to
f
tomorrow
home
by
gardeners
slovenly
signs
of
neglect
everywhere
called
in
s
and
gave
him
a
good
goingover
said
he
was
doing
the
best
he
could
sighed
for
the
good
old
days
tony
preblesham
would
never
have
shuffled
like
that
shall
i
have
to
get
a
new
steward
and
would
he
be
any
improvement
very
bored
after
dinner
almost
decided
to
start
the
book
scribbled
a
few
paragraphs
they
didnt
sound
too
bad
sleep
on
it
bbc
this
morning
reported
grass
in
the
ardennes
this
undoubtedly
means
a
new
influx
from
the
continent
the
coastguard
is
practically
powerless
and
we
will
be
picked
clean
in
spite
of
the
news
f
absolutely
refuses
to
set
a
definite
date
kept
my
temper
with
difficulty
came
home
to
be
annoyed
by
mrs
h
telling
me
k
one
of
the
housemaids
had
been
got
into
trouble
by
an
undergardener
asked
mrs
h
whether
or
not
it
wasnt
her
function
as
a
housekeeper
to
take
care
of
such
details
mrs
h
very
tart
said
in
normal
times
she
was
perfectly
capable
of
handling
the
situation
but
with
everything
going
to
pieces
she
didnt
know
whether
to
turn
off
k
or
the
undergardener
or
both
or
neither
i
thought
her
attitude
toward
me
symptomatic
of
the
general
slackness
and
demoralization
setting
in
all
over
instructed
her
to
discharge
them
both
and
not
bother
me
again
with
such
trivia
tried
to
phone
the
pm
but
the
line
was
down
another
symptom
as
a
sort
of
refuge
went
to
the
library
and
wrote
for
four
solid
hours
relating
the
origin
of
the
grass
feeling
much
better
afterwards
rang
for
mrs
h
and
told
her
merely
to
give
k
a
leave
of
absence
and
discharge
only
the
guilty
undergardener
i
could
see
she
didnt
approve
my
leniency
a
maniac
somehow
got
into
the
ivies
and
forced
his
way
into
the
library
where
i
was
writing
a
horrible
looking
fellow
with
a
tortured
face
he
waved
a
pistol
in
front
of
me
ranting
phrases
reminiscent
of
oldfashioned
soapbox
oratory
i
am
not
ashamed
to
admit
nervousness
for
this
is
not
the
first
time
my
life
has
been
threatened
since
attaining
prominence
happily
the
madman
aim
was
as
wild
as
his
speech
and
though
he
fired
four
shots
all
lodged
in
the
plaster
s
mrs
h
and
b
hearing
the
noise
rushed
in
and
grabbed
him
a
little
upset
by
the
episode
of
the
wouldbe
assassin
i
decided
to
go
up
to
london
for
the
day
the
library
would
be
unusable
anyway
while
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
being
repaired
shaking
experience
can
write
no
more
at
the
moment
i
was
walking
in
regent
square
when
i
saw
her
as
beautiful
and
mysterious
as
she
was
last
time
but
now
my
tongue
was
not
tied
oblivious
to
restraint
and
ridicule
i
shouted
rushed
after
her
i
but
really
that
is
all
i
rushed
after
her
but
she
disappeared
in
the
idle
crowd
people
looked
at
me
curiously
as
i
pushed
and
shoved
peering
crying
wait
wait
a
minute
but
she
was
gone
i
shall
go
back
to
the
ivies
tonight
if
i
stay
longer
in
london
i
fear
i
shall
be
subject
to
further
hallucinations
if
it
was
an
hallucination
and
not
the
strange
lady
herself
grass
reported
in
lyons
f
has
new
experiment
scheduled
for
tomorrow
despite
upset
condition
i
wrote
six
pages
of
my
history
the
work
of
concentrating
under
the
circumstances
was
terrific
but
i
feel
repaid
for
my
effort
i
am
the
captain
of
my
soul
s
says
the
cottagers
no
longer
paying
rent
told
him
to
evict
them
f
test
today
on
some
underbrush
in
a
wood
think
in
future
i
shall
go
only
to
inspect
the
results
the
spraying
is
very
dull
wrote
four
pages
and
tore
them
up
s
says
it
is
impossible
to
evict
tenants
asked
him
if
there
were
no
law
left
in
england
and
he
answered
not
very
much
i
shall
begin
looking
about
for
a
new
steward
hear
the
tharios
are
in
london
grass
reported
beyond
the
vosges
usual
aftermath
of
f
experiment
not
a
sign
of
vegetation
left
in
the
face
of
this
simply
maddening
that
she
doesnt
get
into
action
directly
against
the
grass
got
no
satisfaction
from
her
by
direct
questioning
can
her
whole
attitude
be
motivated
by
some
sort
of
diseased
and
magnified
femininity
noticed
burlet
at
breakfast
had
left
off
his
striped
waistcoat
such
a
thing
has
never
happened
before
not
surprised
when
he
requested
interview
he
began
by
saying
it
had
been
quite
some
time
since
he
put
before
me
his
plan
for
what
he
calls
vertical
cities
not
caring
for
his
attitude
pointed
out
that
it
was
quite
outside
my
province
as
an
employer
to
wetnurse
any
schemes
of
his
nevertheless
out
of
kindness
i
had
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
proper
people
but
mr
weener
sir
people
are
losing
their
lives
so
you
said
before
burlet
and
if
nothing
is
done
the
time
will
come
when
you
also
will
be
killed
by
refugees
or
drowned
by
the
grass
that
borders
on
impertinence
burlet
i
ope
i
ave
never
forgot
my
place
but
umanity
takes
precedence
over
umility
that
will
be
all
burlet
very
good
sir
if
convenient
i
should
like
to
give
notice
as
of
the
first
all
right
burlet
when
he
left
i
was
unreasonably
disturbed
if
i
had
pressed
his
scheme
but
it
was
impracticable
the
grass
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
antwerp
and
questions
are
being
asked
in
parliament
unless
the
government
can
offer
satisfactory
assurances
of
action
by
f
they
are
expected
to
fall
tomorrow
assured
the
pm
i
would
put
the
utmost
pressure
on
f
but
i
know
it
will
do
no
good
the
woman
is
mad
i
would
have
her
certified
and
locked
up
in
an
asylum
in
a
second
if
only
some
other
scientist
would
show
some
signs
of
getting
results
did
not
write
a
word
on
my
history
today
debate
in
parliament
got
nothing
from
f
but
rudeness
wrote
considerably
on
my
book
i
would
like
to
invite
stuart
thario
to
the
ivies
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
show
i
bear
no
malice
but
perhaps
it
would
not
be
wise
riots
in
sheffield
vote
of
confidence
in
commons
the
pm
asked
the
indulgence
of
the
house
and
played
a
record
of
churchill
famous
speech
turning
to
the
question
of
invasion
we
shall
not
fail
we
shall
go
on
to
the
end
we
shall
defend
our
island
whatever
the
cost
we
shall
fight
on
beaches
in
cities
and
on
the
hills
we
shall
never
surrender
result
the
government
squeaked
through
for
against
abstaining
no
one
satisfied
with
the
results
mrs
h
came
to
me
in
great
distress
it
seems
the
larder
is
empty
of
chutney
curry
and
worcestershire
sauce
and
none
of
these
items
can
be
purchased
at
fortnum
mason
or
anywhere
else
i
assured
her
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
since
i
did
not
care
particularly
for
any
of
these
delicacies
mrs
h
swept
this
aside
as
entirely
irrelevant
no
wellconducted
establishment
mr
weener
is
without
chutney
curry
or
worcestershire
the
insularity
of
the
english
is
incredible
i
have
not
tasted
cocacola
hotdogs
or
had
a
bottle
of
ketchup
for
more
than
a
year
but
i
complain
the
grass
is
in
the
schelde
estuary
almost
within
sight
of
the
english
coast
i
got
nothing
written
on
my
history
today
invited
to
see
film
of
a
flight
made
about
six
months
ago
over
what
was
once
the
united
states
very
moving
new
york
still
recognizable
from
the
awkward
shapes
assumed
there
by
the
grass
in
the
harbor
a
strange
mound
of
vegetation
several
of
the
ladies
wept
i
went
home
and
thought
about
george
thario
and
carried
my
history
of
the
grass
up
until
the
time
it
crossed
hollywood
boulevard
the
grass
is
now
in
ostend
definitely
in
sight
from
the
coast
grass
in
dunkirk
f
astounded
me
this
morning
by
coming
to
the
ivies
an
unprecedented
thing
she
is
finally
about
to
undertake
tests
directly
against
the
grass
and
wants
airplanes
and
gasoline
i
impressed
upon
her
how
limited
our
facilities
are
and
how
they
can
not
be
frittered
away
she
screamed
at
me
insanely
the
woman
is
positively
dangerous
in
these
frenzies
and
i
finally
calmed
her
with
the
assurance
only
superficially
exact
that
i
was
dependent
on
the
authorities
for
these
supplies
at
length
i
persuaded
her
she
could
just
as
well
use
motor
launches
since
the
grass
had
now
reached
the
channel
she
reluctantly
agreed
and
grumblingly
departed
my
joy
and
relief
in
her
belated
action
was
dampened
by
her
arrogant
intemperance
can
a
woman
so
unbalanced
really
save
humanity
wrote
wrote
attended
at
breakfast
by
footman
extremely
awkward
and
irritating
inquired
what
had
happened
to
burlet
reminded
he
had
left
annoyed
at
this
typical
lack
of
consideration
on
the
part
of
the
employed
classes
we
give
them
work
and
they
respond
with
a
lack
of
gratitude
which
is
amazing
in
spite
of
vexations
i
brought
my
history
up
to
the
wiping
out
of
los
angeles
leave
with
f
and
party
at
midnight
for
the
tests
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
set
down
the
extent
of
the
depression
which
besets
me
f
assurance
she
has
learned
a
great
deal
from
the
tests
and
didnt
for
a
minute
expect
to
drive
the
grass
back
at
this
point
doesnt
counter
the
fact
that
her
latest
spray
hadnt
the
slightest
effect
on
the
green
mass
which
has
now
replaced
the
sandy
beaches
of
the
pas
de
calais
at
great
personal
inconvenience
i
accompanied
her
on
her
fruitless
mission
and
i
didnt
find
her
excuses
even
when
clothed
in
scientific
verbiage
adequate
compensation
for
the
wasted
time
the
government
finally
fell
today
and
there
is
talk
of
a
coalition
of
national
unity
with
the
queen
herself
assuming
extraordinary
powers
there
was
general
agreement
that
this
would
be
quite
unconstitutional
but
that
wo
prevent
its
being
done
anyway
in
spite
of
the
stringent
watch
against
refugees
the
population
has
so
enlarged
that
rations
have
again
been
cut
mrs
h
says
she
doesnt
know
where
the
next
meal
is
coming
from

i
feel
she
exaggerates

refuse

different

nullify

what
a
lot
of
bluster
professional
authors
make
over
the
writing
of

they
should
have
had
the
necessity
every
businessman
knows
for
sticking
eternally
to
it
and
experience
in
a
newspaper
cityroom
as
i
had
just
before
luncheon
an
overworked
looking

bicycled
over

thoughtfully
allotted
the
patrolling
of

to
me
grass
in
troyes
and
châlons
the
assignment
of
everyone
to
a
definite
post
has
raised
the
general
spirit
ive
always
said
discipline
was
what
people
needed
in
times
of
crisis
takes
their
minds
off
their
troubles
the
prime
minister
spoke
briefly
over
the
wireless
announcing
he
was
in
constant
touch
with
all
the
researchworkers
including
miss
francis
annoyed
at
his
going
over
my
head
this
way
a
quite
unnecessary
discourtesy
marked
incivility
and
slipshodness
among
the
staff
spoke
to
mrs
h
and
to
s
both
agreed
it
was
deplorable
saw
no
immediate
help
for
it
so
upset
by
petty
annoyances
i
could
not
write
on
my
history
glorious
news
the
bbc
announced
the
antigrass
compound
would
be
perfected
before
christmas
f
denies
validity
of
the
wireless
report
said
no
one
with
the
remotest
trace
of
intelligence
would
make
such
a
statement
is
it
impossible
to
have
the
compound
by
then
i
asked
her
it
not
impossible
to
have
it
by
tomorrow
morning
good
heavens
weener
ca
you
understand
i
not
a
soothsayer
can
it
be
some
scientist
i
know
nothing
of
is
getting
ahead
of
her
very
dishonorable
of
the
government
if
so
despite
uncertainties
wrote
three
more
pages
riots
in
manchester
and
birmingham
demagogues
pointing
out
that
even
if
the
antigrass
compound
is
perfected
by
christmas
it
will
be
too
late
to
save
britain
they
do
count
apparently
on
the
channel
holding
the
plague
back
for
long
possible
the
government
may
fall
which
wo
disturb
me
as
i
prefer
the
other
party
anyway
after
a
long
period
of
silence
from
the
continent
radio
mondiale
went
on
the
air
from
cherbourg
asking
permission
for
the
government
to
come
to
london
the
watch
on
the
south
and
east
coasts
has
been
tripled
more
as
a
precaution
against
the
neverceasing
wave
of
invasion
than
the
grass
it
has
been
necessary
to
turn
machineguns
on
the
immigrant
boats
purely
in
selfdefense
the
rioting
in
the
midlands
has
died
down
possibly
on
the
double
assurance
that
permission
for
the
removal
of
the
french
government
had
been
refused
i
can
not
find
out
to
satisfy
my
idle
curiosity
if
it
is
still
the
republic
one
and
indivisible
which
made
the
request
or
whether
that
creation
was
succeeded
by
a
less
eccentric
one
and
that
christmas
was
a
conservative
estimate
for
the
perfection
of
the
compound
a
last
possible
date
brought
my
history
up
to
the
last
war
very
disheartening
talk
with
the
pm
today
it
seems
the
whole
business
of
setting
a
date
was
an
error
from
beginning
to
end
no
one
gave
any
such
promise
it
dare
not
be
denied
now
however
for
fear
of
the
effect
upon
the
public
i
must
begin
to
think
seriously
of
moving
to
ireland

the

blasted
all

hopes

so
she

have
told

so
i
might
urge
on
others

along
different
lines
motored
to
the
laboratory
and
spoke
about

she
agreed
it

be
a
wise
precaution

the
jackass

said
christmas

have
been
so
far
out
afterall
she

very
confident
came
home
relieved
of
all
my
recent
pessimism

my

i
pray
i

very
bad
news
the

two
hundred
miles
from

can
not
say
i
was
well
received
by
the
irish
agent
a
discourteous
and
surly
fellow
left
orders
to
contact
dublin
direct
as
soon
as
phone
service
is
resumed
it
seems
burlet
has
been
interesting
all
sorts
of
radicals
and
crackpots
in
his
scheme
for
glassenclosed
cities
local
mp
very
reproachful
you
should
have
warned
me
mr
weener
i
asked
him
if
he
honestly
thought
the
idea
practical
that
isnt
the
point
not
the
point
at
all
as
far
as
can
be
learned
france
is
completely
gone
now
it
is
supposed
a
fragment
of
spain
and
portugal
are
still
free
of
the
grass
and
a
little
bit
of
africa
it
is
almost
unbelievable
that
all
these
millions
have
perished
and
that
the
only
untouched
land
left
is
these
islands
many
irritations
the
phone
is
in
order
for
perhaps
halfanhour
a
day
only
the
wireless
approximates
a
normal
schedule
wrote
six
pages
dublin
apologized
profusely
for
the
stupidity
of
their
agent
and
offered
me
a
residence
near
kilkenny
and
all
the
facilities
of
trinity
for
f
and
her
staff
told
f
who
merely
grunted
she
then
stated
she
wanted
a
completely
equipped
seagoing
laboratory
for
work
along
the
french
coast
i
said
i
see
what
could
be
done
much
encouraged
by
this
request
the
arrogance
and
shortsightedness
of
the
workingclass
is
beyond
belief
they
refuse
absolutely
to
work
for
wages
any
longer
i
now
have
to
pay
for
all
services
in
concentrates
even
the
warehouse
guards
previously
so
loyal
will
accept
nothing
but
food
i
foresee
a
rapid
dwindling
of
our
precious
supplies
under
this
onslaught
with
all
the
shipping
consolidated
pemmican
owns
i
can
find
nothing
suitable
for
f
work
almost
decided
to
outfit
my
personal
yacht
for
that
purpose
it
would
be
convenient
to
use
for
the
irish
removal
if
that
becomes
necessary
burlet
ideas
have
found
their
way
into
parliament
the
independent
labour
member
from
south
tooting
asked
the
home
minister
why
nothing
had
been
done
about
vertical
cities
the
home
minister
replied
that
britons
never
would
permit
a
stolon
of
the
grass
to
grow
on
english
soil
and
therefore
such
fantastic
ideas
were
superfluous
ilp
mp
not
satisfied
ordered
the
to
southampton
for
refitting
it
will
cost
me
thousands
of
tons
of
precious
concentrates
besides
lying
for
weeks
in
a
dangerously
exposed
spot
but
i
can
make
a
better
deal
in
southampton
than
elsewhere
and
i
refuse
to
be
infected
by
the
general
cowardice
of
the
masses
speaking
of
the
general
temper
i
must
say
there
has
been
a
stiffening
of
spirit
in
the
last
week
or
so
very
laudable
and
encouraging
to
one
who
believes
in
the
essential
dignity
of
human
nature
no
new
report
on
the
grass
for
four
days
the
member
from
south
tooting
has
introduced
a
bill
to
start
construction
at
once
of
one
of
burlet
cities
the
bill
calls
for
the
conscription
of
manpower
for
the
work
and
whatever
materials
may
be
necessary
without
compensation
the
last
clause
is
of
course
aimed
directly
at
me
naturally
the
bill
will
not
pass
flew
to
kilkenny
i
fear
this
will
be
one
of
the
last
plane
trips
i
can
make
for
a
long
time
since
the
store
of
aviation
gasoline
is
just
about
exhausted
the
place
is
much
more
beautiful
than
hampshire
but
deplorably
inconvenient
however
since
the
irish
are
still
willing
to
work
for
money
i
have
ordered
extensive
alterations
i
have
stopped
all
sale
of
concentrates
since
money
will
buy
nothing
it
would
be
foolish
of
me
to
give
my
most
precious
asset
away
of
course
we
cut
the
deliveries
down
to
a
mere
dribble
some
time
ago
but
even
that
dribble
could
bleed
me
to
death
in
time
i
have
doubled
the
wages
in
concentrates
of
the
warehouse
guards
in
fear
of
possible
looting
the
last
three
days
have
been
filled
with
terror
and
suspense
it
began
when
a
patrolling
shepherd
on
the
isle
of
skye
found
a
suspicious
clump
of
grass
all
conditions
favored
the
invader
the
spot
was
isolated
communications
were
difficult
local
labor
was
inadequate
the
exhaustion
of
the
fuel
supply
made
it
impossible
to
fly
grassfighters
in
and
men
had
to
be
sent
by
sea
with
makeshift
equipment
happily
there
were
two
supercyclone
fans
at
lochinvar
which
had
been
shipped
there
by
mistake
and
these
were
immediately
dispatched
to
the
threatened
area
the
clump
was
fought
with
fire
and
dynamite
with
the
fans
preventing
the
broken
stolons
from
rooting
themselves
again
after
a
period
of
grave
anxiety
and
doubt
there
seems
to
be
no
question
this
particular
peril
has
been
averted
not
a
trace
of
the
threatening
weed
remains
the
queen
went
personally
to
westminster
abbey
to
give
thanks
work
on
the
proceeding
slowly
i
have
decided
to
keep
my
own
cabin
intact
and
have
the
adjoining
one
fitted
for
a
writing
room
then
i
can
accompany
f
on
her
experimental
excursions
and
not
lose
any
time
on
my
book
which
is
progressing
famously
what
a
satisfaction
creative
endeavor
is
the
bill
for
the
construction
of
burlet
city
was
debated
today
the
pm
stated
flatly
that
the
grass
would
be
overcome
before
the
city
could
be
built
cheers
the
hon
member
from
south
tooting
rose
to
inquire
if
the
right
hon
member
could
offer
something
besides
his
bare
word
for
this
groans
faint
applause
cries
of
shame
no
gentleman
etcetera
the
home
minister
begged
to
inform
the
hon
member
from
south
tooting
that
her
majesty
government
had
gone
deeply
into
the
question
of
the
socalled
vertical
cities
long
before
the
hon
member
had
ever
heard
of
them
did
the
hon
member
ever
consider
no
matter
how
many
precautions
were
taken
in
the
building
of
conduits
for
a
water
supply
that
seeds
of
the
grass
would
undoubtedly
find
their
way
in
through
that
medium
or
through
the
air
intakes
no
matter
how
high
dead
silence
the
hon
member
from
stoke
pogis
asked
if
the
opposition
to
his
hon
friend
bill
wasnt
the
result
of
pressure
by
a
certain
capitalist
concerned
principally
with
the
manufacture
of
concentrated
foods
groans
and
catcalls
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
inquired
if
the
hon
member
meant
to
impugn
the
integrity
of
the
government
cries
of
shame
no
unthinkable
etcetera
if
not
what
did
the
hon
member
imply
obstinate
silence
since
no
answer
was
forthcoming
he
would
move
for
a
division
result
the
bill
overwhelmingly
voted
down
since
the
skye
excitement
everyone
is
inclined
to
be
jittery
and
nerves
are
stretched
tightly
when
i
told
f
she
had
missed
a
great
opportunity
to
test
her
formula
in
scotland
she
blew
up
and
called
me
a
meddling
parasite
this
is
pretty
good
coming
from
a
dependent
only
my
forbearance
and
consideration
for
her
sex
kept
me
from
turning
her
out
on
the
spot
encouraged
by
the
skye
episode
a
group
of
volunteers
is
being
formed
to
attempt
an
attack
on
the
grass
covering
the
channel
islands
more
than
can
possibly
be
used
are
offering
their
services
i
subscribed
toward
the
venture
preparations
for
moving
to
kilkenny
almost
complete
even
if
f
gets
going
by
december
and
the
scottish
repulse
is
permanent
i
believe
i
shall
be
better
off
in
ireland
until
the
first
definite
victory
is
won
against
the
grass
the
grass
moved
again
and
this
time
all
attempts
to
repulse
it
failed
it
is
now
firmly
entrenched
on
both
the
orkneys
and
the
hebrides
terrible
pessimism
commons
voted
no
confidence
to
and
my
old
friend
d
n
is
back
in
office
almost
ready
find
i
can
get
a
crew
to
work
for
wages
when
not
in
port
luncheon
at
chequers
pm
urges
me
not
to
leave
england
as
it
might
shake
confidence
i
told
him
i
would
consider
the
matter
f
says
she
is
ready
to
make
new
tests
and
what
is
holding
up
work
on
the
replied
it
was
complete
except
for
my
cabins
she
had
the
effrontery
to
say
these
werent
important
and
she
was
ready
to
go
ahead
without
me
i
pointed
out
that
the
was
my
property
and
it
would
not
sail
until
i
was
properly
accommodated
i
shall
not
move
to
ireland
afterall
the
grass
has
a
foothold
in
ulster
the
irish
are
swarming
into
scotland
and
wales
impossible
to
keep
them
out
donegal
overrun
on
board
the
wrote
an
incredible
amount
still
beyond
me
how
anybody
can
call
the
fashioning
of
a
book
work
we
left
southampton
last
night
on
a
full
tide
and
are
now
cruising
the
channel
about
four
miles
from
the
french
coast
it
is
quite
unbelievable
under
this
tropical
green
blanket
lies
the
continent
of
europe
the
home
of
civilization
and
the
bodies
of
millions
too
except
for
a
few
gulls
who
shriek
their
way
inland
and
return
dejectedly
there
is
not
a
living
thing
in
sight
but
the
grass
i
have
reserved
the
afterdeck
to
myself
and
as
i
sit
here
now
scribbling
these
notes
i
think
what
impresses
me
more
than
anything
else
is
the
feeling
of
vitality
which
radiates
from
the
herbaceous
coast
the
dead
continent
is
alive
alive
as
never
before
wholly
alive
moving
with
millions
of
sensitive
feelers
in
every
direction
for
the
first
time
i
have
a
feeling
of
sympathy
for
joe
constant
talk
of
the
beauty
of
the
grass
but
in
spite
of
this
the
question
which
comes
to
my
mind
is
can
you
speak
glibly
about
the
beauty
of
something
which
has
strangled
nearly
all
the
world
sitting
on
the
gently
swaying
deck
i
was
moved
to
add
several
pages
to
my
history
but
now
we
are
approaching
the
narrower
part
of
the
channel
and
the
sea
is
getting
choppy
i
shall
have
to
give
up
my
jottings
for
a
while
f
finally
picked
a
spot
she
considered
suitable
the
remains
of
a
small
harbor
and
we
anchored
i
must
say
she
was
overfussy
one
cove
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
another
these
days
possibly
she
was
so
choosy
in
order
to
heighten
her
importance
repetition
of
the
involved
etiquette
of
inspecting
the
intended
victim
and
turning
on
the
sprays
only
this
time
the
suppressed
excitement
anticipating
possible
success
made
even
the
preliminaries
interesting
miss
francis
and
her
assistants
retired
for
a
mysterious
conference
immediately
after
the
application
and
i
stayed
up
late
talking
with
the
captain
till
he
was
called
away
by
some
duty
it
is
now
nearly
two
a
m
in
a
few
hours
we
shall
know
horribly
shaken
this
morning
to
find
the
grass
unaffected
even
wondered
for
a
moment
if
it
were
conceivable
that
f
would
never
find
the
right
compound
that
nothing
could
hurt
the
grass
had
i
been
illadvised
in
not
going
more
seriously
into
burlet
vertical
cities
f
very
phlegmatic
about
it
says
another
twelve
hours
of
observation
may
be
of
value
she
and
a
rowed
ashore
over
the
runners
trailing
in
the
water
and
with
great
difficulty
succeeded
in
hacking
off
a
few
runners
of
the
sprayed
grass
i
thought
her
undertaking
this
hazard
an
absurd
piece
of
bravado
she
might
just
as
well
have
sent
someone
else
disregarding
her
rudeness
in
not
inviting
me
i
accompanied
her
unasked
to
her
she
laid
the
stolons
on
an
enamelsurfaced
table
and
busied
herself
with
some
apparatus
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
these
segments
of
the
grass
they
lay
on
the
table
not
specimens
of
vegetation
but
stunned
creatures
ready
to
spring
to
vigorous
and
vengeful
life
when
they
recovered
it
was
impossible
not
to
pick
one
up
and
run
it
through
my
fingers
feeling
again
the
soft
electric
touch
miss
francis
preparations
were
interminable
if
she
follows
such
an
elaborate
ritual
for
the
mere
checking
of
an
unsuccessful
experiment
no
wonder
she
is
taking
years
to
get
anywhere
my
attention
wandered
and
i
started
to
leave
the
cabin
when
i
noticed
my
hand
still
held
one
of
the
specimens
it
was
withered
and
dry
the
enthusiasm
greeting
the
discovery
that
reagent
mortally
affected
the
grass
was
only
tempered
by
the
dampening
thought
that
its
action
had
been
incomplete
what
good
was
the
lethal
compound
if
its
work
were
final
only
when
the
sprayed
parts
were
severed
f
seemed
to
think
it
was
a
great
deal
of
good
her
manner
toward
me
boisterous
and
quite
out
of
keeping
with
our
respective
positions
and
sexes
could
almost
be
called
friendly
during
the
return
to
southampton
she
constantly
clapped
me
on
the
back
and
shouted
it
over
weener
it
all
over
now
but
it
isnt
over
i
protested
your
spray
hadnt
the
slightest
direct
effect
on
the
grass
oh
that
that
nothing
a
mere
impediment
a
matter
of
time
only
time
only
good
god
do
you
realize
the
grass
is
halfway
through
ireland
that
we
are
surrounded
now
on
four
sides
a
lastminute
rescue
is
quite
in
the
best
tradition
do
disturb
yourself
you
will
live
to
gloat
over
the
deaths
of
better
men
i
urged
the
pm
to
be
cautious
about
overoptimism
in
giving
out
the
news
he
nodded
his
head
solemnly
in
agreement
but
he
evidently
couldnt
communicate
whatever
wisdom
he
possessed
to
the
bbc
announcer
for
he
in
butter
voice
spoke
as
though
miss
francis
had
actually
destroyed
a
great
section
of
the
weed
upon
the
french
coast
there
were
celebrations
in
the
streets
of
london
and
a
vast
crowd
visited
the
cenotaph
and
sang
hoping
to
find
f
in
a
calmer
mood
i
asked
her
today
just
how
long
she
meant
by
a
matter
of
time
she
shrugged
it
off
not
more
than
four
or
five
months
she
said
blithely
in
a
month
at
most
the
grass
will
be
in
britain
let
it
come
she
responded
callously
we
shall
take
the
and
conclude
our
work
there
but
millions
will
die
in
the
meantime
i
protested
she
turned
on
me
with
what
i
can
only
describe
as
tigrish
ferocity
did
you
think
of
the
millions
you
condemned
to
death
when
you
refused
to
sell
concentrates
to
the
asiatic
refugees
how
could
i
sell
to
people
who
couldnt
buy
and
the
millions
who
died
because
you
refused
them
employment
am
i
responsible
for
those
too
shiftless
to
fend
for
themselves
i
my
brother
keeper
if
fifty
million
englishmen
die
because
i
can
not
hasten
the
process
of
trial
and
error
the
guilt
is
mine
and
i
admit
it
i
do
not
seek
to
exculpate
myself
by
pointing
a
finger
at
you
or
by
silly
and
pompous
evasions
of
my
responsibility
if
the
grass
comes
before
i
am
ready
the
fault
is
mine
in
the
meantime
while
one
creature
remains
alive
even
if
his
initials
be
a
w
i
shall
seek
to
preserve
him
as
long
as
there
is
a
foothold
on
land
i
shall
try
on
land
and
when
that
fails
we
shall
board
the
and
finish
our
work
there
somewhere
in
the
atlantic
you
mean
you
definitely
abandon
hope
of
perfecting
your
compound
before
england
goes
i
abandon
nothing
she
replied
i
think
it
quite
possible
finish
in
time
to
save
england
but
i
ca
afford
to
do
anything
but
look
forward
to
the
worst
and
that
is
that
we
be
driven
to
the
sea
i
was
appalled
by
the
picture
her
words
elicited
a
few
ships
containing
the
survivors
a
world
covered
with
the
grass
and
when
success
is
attained
we
shall
fight
our
way
back
inch
by
inch
but
this
piece
of
bombast
didnt
hearten
me
i
had
no
desire
to
fight
our
way
back
inch
by
inch
i
wanted
at
least
a
fragment
of
civilization
salvaged
f
has
not
been
the
only
one
to
think
of
the
high
seas
as
a
final
refuge
the
london
office
has
been
literally
besieged
by
men
of
wealth
eager
to
pay
any
price
to
charter
one
of
our
ships
i
have
given
orders
to
grant
no
more
charters
for
the
present
the
enthusiasm
is
subsiding
and
people
are
beginning
to
ask
how
long
it
will
be
before
they
can
expect
the
reconquest
of
the
continent
to
begin
bbc
spoke
cautiously
about
perfection
of
the
compound
for
the
first
time
opening
the
way
to
the
implication
that
it
doesnt

as

added
quite
a
bit
to
my
manuscript
mrs
h
in
very
dignified
mood
approached
me
said
she
heard
i
had
made
plans
to
leave
england
in
case
the
grass
threatened
she
asked
nothing
for
herself
she
said
being
quite
content
to
accept
whatever
fate
providence
had
in
store
for
her
but
would
i
take
her
daughter
and
family
along
on
the
they
would
be
quite
useful
she
added
lamely
i
said
i
would
give
the
matter
my
attention
but
assured
her
there
was
no
immediate
danger
grass
on
the
isle
of
man
ordered
stocking
of
the
with
as
much
concentrates
as
she
can
carry
the
supply
will
be
ample
for
a
full
crew
f
staff
and
myself
for
at
least
six
months
ive
known
for
years
that
f
is
insane
but
her
latest
phase
is
so
fantastic
and
preposterous
i
can
hardly
credit
it
she
demands
flatly
the
take
along
at
least
fifty
nubile
females
in
order
to
restock
the
world
after
its
reconquest
after
catching
my
breath
i
argued
with
her
the
prospect
of
england
loss
was
by
no
means
certain
yet
good
we
give
the
girls
a
seavoyage
and
land
them
back
safe
and
sound
we
have
enough
supplies
for
six
months
if
we
take
along
these
superfluous
passengers
our
time
will
be
cut
to
less
than
three
her
answer
was
a
brutal
piece
of
blackmail
no
women
no
go
if
f
were
a
young
man
instead
of
an
elderly
woman
i
could
understand
this
aberration
better
it
seems
mrs
h
grandchildren
are
all
girls
between
twelve
and
eighteen
which
leaves
the
problem
of
fulfilling
ultimatum
to
finding
fortyseven
others
i
have
delegated
the
selection
to
mrs

i
can
not

query
as
to
whether
this

objectionable
to
her

announces
she
is
ready
for
another
test
under

conditions

journey
to

out
of
the
question
we
decided
to
use
the

and
the
french

leaving

this
constant
series
of
frustrations
is
beyond
endurance
in
spite
of
f
noncommittal
pessimism
anticipating
success
only
after
the
grass
has
covered
england
i
feel
she
is
merely
making
some
sort
of
propitiatory
gesture
when
she
looks
on
the
darkest
side
of
the
picture
that
way
as
for
myself
i
convinced
the
grass
will
be
stopped
in
a
week
or
so
but
in
the
meantime
f
work
advances
by
the
inch
only
to
be
set
back
again
and
again
we
repeated
the
previous
test
with
just
enough
added
success
to
give
our
failure
the
quality
of
supreme
exasperation
this
time
there
was
no
question
but
what
the
growth
sprayed
actually
withered
within
twentyfour
hours
but
it
was
not
wiped
out
and
not
long
afterward
it
was
overrun
and
covered
up
by
a
new
and
vigorous
mass
such
a
victory
early
in
the
fight
would
have
meant
something
now
it
is
too
late
for
such
piecemeal
destruction
we
must
have
a
counteragent
which
communicates
its
lethal
effect
to
a
larger
area
of
the
grass
than
is
actually
touched
by
it
or
at
very
least
makes
the
affected
spot
untenable
for
future
growth
what
help
is
it
for
f
to
rub
her
hands
smugly
and
say
we
on
the
right
track
all
right
weve
been
on
the
right
track

months

for
a
horrible
moment
i
wondered
if
she
thought
i
was
arranging
for
a
harem
decided
purely
as
a
matter
of
convenience
and
not
from
panic
such
as
is
beginning
to
affect
even
the
traditionally
stolid
british
to
move
aboard
the
grass
on
the
outskirts
of
edinburgh
in
a
burst
of
energy
last
night
i
brought
my
history
down
to
the
grass
in
europe
disconcerting
hitch
most
of
the
crew
including
the
captain
want
to
take
their
wives
along
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
them
all
uxoriously
wed
at
any
rate
this
is
not
a
pleasure
excursion
agreed
the
captain
should
take
his
and
told
him
to
effect
some
compromise
on
the
others
the
capacity
of
the
is
not
elastic
grass
almost
to
the
tweed
pm
on
the
wireless
with
the
assurance
a
counteragent
will
be
perfected
within
the
week
f
furious
wanted
to
know
if
i
couldnt
control
my
politicians
better
i
answered
meekly
really
her
anger
was
ludicrous
that
i
was
an
american
citizen
not
part
of
the
british
electorate
and
therefore
had
no
influence
over
the
prime
minister
of
great
britain
seriously
however
perhaps
the
premature
announcement
will
spur
her
on
the
erratic
phone
service
finally
stopped
altogether
riots
and
looting
unenglish
manifestations
carried
out
in
a
very
english
way
hysterical
orators
called
for
the
destruction
of
all
foreign
refugees
from
the
grass
or
at
very
least
their
exclusion
from
the
benefits
of
the
lootings
in
every
case
the
mob
answered
them
in
almost
identical
language

play

and
share
alike

cheerfully
to
clean
out
all

the

getting
their

there
must
be
a
peculiar
salubrity
about
the
english

could
not

so
differently
at

and
abroad
thankful
indeed
all

into

but
quite
unexpectedly
england
has
also
been
invaded

another
quarter

durham

the

about
a
set
of

sails
for

tonight
heard
indirectly
that
the
tharios
had
managed
to
charter
a

tug
on

with
friends
this
takes

it

not

to
perfect

before
the

reaches
london
on

the
what
has
become
of
the
stolid
heroism
of
the
english
people
on
the
way
down
to
the
ship
i
ran
into
a
crowd
no
better
behaved
than
the
adherents
of
the
republic
one
and
indivisible
i
mention
the
episode
lightly
but
it
was
no
laughing
matter
i
was
lucky
to
escape
with
my
life
nervous
and
upset
with
the
strain
i
shall
not
return
to
the
ivies
till
the
grass
begins
its
retreat
too
restless
to
continue
my
book
paced
the
deck
a
long
time
the
fifty
girls
arrived
and
a
more
maddening
cargo
i
ca
imagine
i
gave
orders
to
keep
them
forward
but
their
shrill
presence
nevertheless
penetrates
aft
i
hear
all
electricity
has
been
cut
off
grass
in
yorkshire
f
came
aboard
with
the
other
scientists
and
immediately
wanted
to
know
why
we
didnt
set
sail
i
asked
her
if
her
work
could
be
carried
on
any
more
easily
at
sea
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
pointed
out
that
only
rats
leave
a
sinking
ship
and
england
was
far
from
overcome
she
favored
me
with
one
of
her
fixed
stares
you
are
dithery
weener
your
epigrams
have
lost
their
jaunty
air
of
discovery
and
your
face
is
almost
green
you
would
not
expect
me
to
remain
unaffected
by
the
events
around
us
miss
francis
wouldnt
i
she
retorted
incomprehensibly
and
went
below
to
her
the
grass
is
reported
in
essex
and
hertfordshire
i
understand
there
are
at
least
two
other
ships
equipped
for
research
and
manned
by
english
scientists
it
would
serve
f
right
if
they
perfected
a
counteragent
first
october
have
ordered
our
accompanying
ships
to
lie
offshore
lest
they
be
boarded
by
fearcrazed
refugees
for
the

now
in
the
vicinity
of
london
and

in
a
horrible
state
october
bbc
transmitting
from
penzance
faint
on
board
the
off
scilly
the
last
days
of
england
have
passed
heightening
the
horror
the
bbc
in
its
final
moments
forwent
its
policy
of
soothing
its
listeners
and
urging
calmness
upon
them
instead
it
organized
an
amazing
news
service
using
thousands
of
pigeons
carrying
messages
from
eyewitnesses
to
the
station
at
penzance
to
give
a
minutebyminute
account
of
the
end
dispassionately
and
detachedly
as
though
this
were
some
ordinary
disaster
announcer
after
announcer
went
on
the
air
and
read
reports
heartpiercing
anticlimactic
tragic
trivial
noble
and
thoroughly
english
reports
the
people
vented
their
futile
rage
and
terror
in
mass
pyromania
building
after
building
city
after
city
was
burned
to
the
ground
but
according
to
the
bbc
the
murderous
frenzy
of
the
continent
was
not
duplicated
inanimate
things
suffered
priceless
art
objects
were
kicked
around
in
the
streets
but
houses
were
carefully
emptied
of
inhabitants
before
being
put
to
the
torch
these
were
the
spectacular
happenings
the
emphatic
events
behind
them
and
in
the
majority
were
quieter
duller
transactions
churches
and
chapels
filled
with
people
sitting
quiet
in
pews
meditating
gatherings
in
the
country
where
the
participants
looked
at
the
sun
earth
and
sky
vast
meetings
in
hyde
park
proclaiming
the
indissoluble
brotherhood
of
man
even
in
the
face
of
extinction
we
heard
the
queen
and
her
consort
remained
in
buckingham
palace
to
the
last
but
this
may
be
only
romantic
rumor
at
all
events
england
is
gone
now
after
weathering
a
millennium
of
unsuccessful
invasions
from
where
i
sit
peacefully
bringing
my
history
uptodate
and
jotting
these
notes
in
my
diary
i
can
see
faintly
with
the
naked
eye
or
quite
distinctly
through
a
telescope
that
emerald
gem
set
in
a
silver
sea
the
great
cities
are
covered
the
barren
moors
the
lovely
lakes
the
gentle
streams
the
forbidding
crags
are
all
mantled
in
one
grassy
sward
england
is
gone
and
with
it
the
world
what
few
men
of
forethought
who
have
taken
to
ships
what
odd
survivors
there
may
be
in
arctic
wastes
or
on
lofty
andean
or
himalayan
peaks
together
with
the
complement
of
the
and
its
accompanying
escort
are
all
that
survive
of
humanity
it
is
an
awesome
thought
reading
this
over
it
seems
almost
as
though
i
had
been
untrue
to
my
fundamental
philosophy
the
world
has
gone
vanished
but
perhaps
it
is
for
the
best
afterall
we
shall
start
again
in
a
few
days
with
a
clean
slate
picking
up
from
where
we
left
off
for
we
have
books
and
tools
and
men
of
learning
and
intelligence
to
start
a
new
and
better
world
the
moment
the
grass
retreats
i
am
heartened
by
the
thought
below
miss
francis
and
her
coworkers
are
striving
for
the
solution
after
the
last
experiment
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
outcome
an
hour
ago
i
would
have
written
that
it
was
deplorable
this
outcome
couldnt
be
achieved
before
the
latest
victory
of
the
grass
now
i
begin
to
believe
it
may
be
a
lucky
delay
what
meaning
have
dates
now
we
shall
have
to
have
a
new
calendar
before
the
grass
and
after
the
grass
moved
by
some
incomprehensible
morbidity
i
had
a
stainless
steel
chest
complete
with
floats
made
before
embarkation
in
order
to
place
the
manuscript
and
diary
in
it
should
the
impossible
happen
i
have
it
now
on
the
deck
beside
me
as
a
reminder
never
to
give
way
to
a
weak
despair
f
promises
me
it
is
a
matter
of
days
if
not
hours
till
we
can
return
to
our
native
element
another
test
almost
completely
successful
f
certain
the
next
one
will
do
it
my
emotions
are
exhausted
i
have
completed
my
history
of
the
grass
down
to
the
commencement
of
this
diary
i
shall
take
a
wellearned
rest
from
my
literary
labors
for
a
few
days
f
announces
a
new
test
the
final
one
weener
the
final
one
for
tomorrow
experiment
with
the
now
perfected
compound
has
been
put
off
one
more
day
f
is
completely
calm
and
confident
of
the
outcome
she
is
below
now
making
lastminute
preparations
for
the
first
time
she
has
infected
me
with
her
certitude
although
i
never
doubted
ultimate
success
and
i
feel
tomorrow
will
actually
see
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
the
grass
which
started
so
long
ago
on
mrs
dinkman
lawn
how
far
i
and
the
world
have
come
since
then
would
i
go
back
to
that
day
if
i
had
the
power
it
seems
an
absurd
question
but
there
is
no
doubt
we
who
have
survived
have
gained
spiritual
stature
of
course
i
do
not
mean
anything
mystical
or
supernatural
by
this
observation
we
have
acquired
heightened
sensitivity
and
new
perceptions
brother
paul
ridiculous
mountebank
was
yet
correct
in
this
the
grass
chastised
us
rightly
whatever
sins
mankind
committed
have
been
wiped
out
and
expiated
we
are
out
of
sight
of
land
nothing
but
sea
and
sky
no
green
anywhere
on
the
eve
of
liberation
all
sorts
of
absurd
and
irrelevant
thoughts
jump
about
in
my
mind
the
strange
lady
joe
symphony
burned
by
his
mother
whatever
happened
to
william
rufus
le
ffaçasé
after
he
eschewed
his
profession
for
superstition
and
mrs
dinkman
for
some
annoying
reason
i
am
beset
with
the
thought
of
mrs
dinkman
i
can
see
her
pincenez
illadjusted
on
her
nose
i
can
hear
her
highpitched
complaining
voice
bargaining
with
me
over
the
cost
of
inoculating
her
lawn
the
ugly
stuff
of
her
tasteless
dress
is
before
my
eyes
it
is
so
real
to
me
i
swear
i
can
see
the
poor
irregular
lines
of
the
weaving
i
have
sat
here
in
a
dull
lethargy
undoubtedly
induced
by
my
overwrought
state
quite
understandable
in
the
light
of
what
is
to
happen
in
a
few
hours
my
eyes
on
the
seams
of
the
deck
reviewing
all
the
things
i
have
written
in
my
book
preparing
myself
a
way
for
the
glorious
and
triumphant
finish
but
i
am
beset
by
delusions
a
moment
ago
it
was
the
figure
of
mrs
dinkman
and
now
and
now
by
all
the
horror
that
has
overcome
mankind
it
is
a
waving
creeping
insatiable
runner
of
the
grass
i
have
made
no
attempt
to
pinch
off
the
green
stolon
it
must
be
three
inches
long
by
now
and
the
slim
end
is
waving
in
the
wind
seeking
for
a
suitable
spot
to
assure
its
hold
doubly
i
touched
it
with
my
hand
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
harm
it
i
managed
to
drag
my
eyes
away
from
the
plant
and
go
below
to
see
miss
francis
i
stood
outside
the
cabin
for
a
long
time
listening
to
the
noise
and
laughter
coupled
with
a
note
of
triumph
i
had
never
heard
before
and
which
i
sure
indicates
indubitable
success
there
can
be
no
question
of
that
there
can
be
no
question
of
that
the
stolon
has
pressed
itself
into
another
seam
the
blades
are
very
green
they
have
opened
themselves
to
the
sun
and
are
sucking
strength
for
the
new
shoots
i
have
put
my
manuscript
into
the
casket
which
floats
leaving
it
open
for
this
diary
if
it
should
be
necessary
but
of
course
such
a
contingency
is
absurd
absolutely
absurd
the
grass
has
found
another
seam
in
the
deck
