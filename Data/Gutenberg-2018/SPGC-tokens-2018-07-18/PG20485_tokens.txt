errata
the
lunatic
at
large
introductory
into
the
history
of
mr
francis
beveridge
as
supplied
by
the
obliging
candour
of
the
baron
von
blitzenberg
and
the
notes
of
dr
escott
dr
twiddel
and
his
friend
robert
welsh
make
a
kind
of
explanatory
entry
they
most
effectually
set
the
ball
and
so
the
story
starts
in
a
small
room
looking
out
on
a
very
uninteresting
london
street
it
was
about
three
o
clock
on
a
november
afternoon
that
season
of
fogs
and
rains
and
mud
when
long
for
fresh
air
and
hillsides
and
think
wistfully
of
the
warmth
and
lights
of
a
city
when
nobody
is
satisfied
and
everybody
has
a
cold
outside
the
window
of
the
room
there
were
a
few
feet
of
earth
adorned
with
a
low
bush
or
two
a
line
of
railings
a
street
and
on
the
other
side
a
long
row
of
uniform
yellow
brick
houses
the
apartment
itself
was
a
modest
chamber
containing
a
minimum
of
rented
furniture
and
a
flickering
by
a
small
caseful
of
medical
treatises
and
a
conspicuous
stethoscope
the
least
experienced
could
see
that
it
was
labelled
dr
twiddel
was
enjoying
one
of
those
moments
of
repose
that
occur
even
in
the
youngest
practitioner
s
existence
for
the
purposes
of
this
narrative
he
may
briefly
be
described
as
an
young
man
with
a
little
bit
of
fair
moustache
and
still
less
chin
no
practice
to
speak
of
and
a
considerable
quantity
of
unpaid
bills
a
man
of
such
features
and
in
such
circumstances
invites
temptation
at
the
present
moment
though
his
waistcoat
was
unbuttoned
and
his
feet
rested
on
the
mantelpiece
his
mind
seemed
not
quite
at
ease
he
looked
back
upon
a
number
of
fortunate
events
that
had
not
occurred
and
forward
to
various
unpleasant
things
that
might
occur
and
then
he
took
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
abstractedly
i
can
t
afford
to
refuse
he
reflected
lugubriously
and
yet
hang
it
i
must
say
i
don
t
fancy
the
when
metal
is
molten
it
can
be
poured
into
any
vessel
and
at
that
moment
a
certain
deep
receptacle
stood
on
the
very
doorstep
the
doctor
heard
the
bell
sat
up
briskly
stuffed
the
letter
back
into
his
pocket
and
buttoned
his
waistcoat
a
patient
at
last
and
instantly
there
arose
a
vision
of
a
simple
operation
a
fabulous
fee
and
twelve
sickly
millionaires
an
hour
ever
after
the
door
opened
and
a
loud
voice
hailed
him
familiarly
only
welsh
he
sighed
and
the
vision
went
the
way
of
all
the
others
the
gentleman
who
swaggered
in
and
clapped
the
doctor
on
the
back
who
next
threw
himself
into
the
easiest
chair
and
his
hat
and
coat
over
the
table
was
in
fact
mr
robert
welsh
from
the
moment
he
entered
he
pervaded
the
room
the
stethoscope
seemed
to
grow
less
conspicuous
dr
twiddel
s
chin
more
diminutive
the
apartment
itself
a
mere
background
to
this
guest
why
it
would
be
hard
to
say
precisely
he
was
a
man
with
an
air
of
the
most
consummate
assurance
and
a
person
by
some
deemed
handsome
yet
somehow
or
other
he
inevitably
recalled
the
uncles
of
history
perhaps
this
assurance
alone
gave
him
his
atmosphere
you
could
have
felt
his
egotism
in
the
dark
he
talked
in
a
loud
voice
and
with
a
great
air
of
mastery
over
all
the
contingencies
of
a
life
about
town
you
felt
that
here
sat
one
who
had
seen
the
world
and
gave
things
their
proper
proportions
who
had
learned
how
meretricious
was
orthodoxy
and
which
bars
could
really
be
recommended
he
chaffed
patronised
and
cheered
the
doctor
patients
had
been
scarce
had
they
well
after
all
there
were
many
consolations
did
twiddle
say
he
was
hard
up
welsh
himself
in
an
even
more
evil
case
he
narrated
various
unfortunate
transactions
connected
with
the
turf
and
other
pursuits
with
regret
no
doubt
and
yet
with
a
fine
rakish
defiance
of
destiny
twiddel
s
face
cleared
and
he
began
to
show
something
of
the
same
gallant
spirit
he
brought
out
a
tall
bottle
with
a
celtic
superscription
welsh
half
filled
his
glass
poured
in
some
water
from
a
dusty
decanter
and
proposed
the
toast
of
luck
to
the
two
most
deserving
sinners
in
london
the
doctor
was
fired
he
drew
the
same
letter
from
his
pocket
and
cried
by
jove
welsh
i
d
almost
forgotten
to
tell
you
of
a
lucky
offer
that
came
this
this
was
not
strictly
true
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
doctor
had
only
hesitated
to
tell
of
this
offer
lest
he
should
be
shamed
to
a
decision
but
welsh
was
infectious
congratulations
old
man
said
his
friend
what
s
it
all
about
here
s
a
letter
from
an
old
friend
of
my
people
watson
by
name
he
has
a
very
good
country
practice
and
he
offers
me
this
he
handed
the
letter
to
welsh
and
then
added
with
a
flutter
of
caution
i
haven
t
made
up
my
mind
yet
there
are
drawbacks
as
you
ll
welsh
opened
the
letter
and
read
dear
twiddel
am
happy
to
tell
you
that
i
am
at
last
able
to
put
something
in
your
way
a
gentleman
in
this
neighbourhood
one
of
my
most
esteemed
patients
has
lately
suffered
from
a
severe
mental
and
physical
shock
followed
by
brain
fever
and
is
still
i
regret
to
say
in
an
extremely
unstable
mental
condition
i
have
strongly
recommended
quiet
and
change
of
scene
and
at
my
suggestion
he
is
to
be
sent
abroad
under
the
care
of
a
medical
attendant
i
have
now
much
pleasure
in
offering
you
the
post
if
you
would
care
to
accept
it
you
will
find
your
patient
mr
an
extremely
agreeable
young
man
when
in
possession
of
his
proper
faculties
he
has
large
means
and
no
near
relatives
he
comes
of
one
of
the
best
families
in
the
county
and
though
he
has
i
surmise
sown
his
wild
oats
pretty
freely
he
was
considered
of
unusual
promise
previous
to
this
unfortunate
illness
he
is
of
an
amiable
and
pleasant
disposition
though
at
present
we
fear
inclined
to
suicidal
tendencies
i
have
no
particular
reason
to
think
he
is
at
all
homicidal
still
you
will
see
that
he
naturally
requires
most
careful
watching
it
is
possible
that
you
may
hesitate
to
leave
your
practice
which
i
trust
prospers
but
as
the
responsibility
is
considerable
the
fee
will
be
proportionately
and
all
expenses
five
hundred
quid
exclaimed
welsh
i
would
suggest
a
trip
on
the
continent
the
duration
and
the
places
to
be
visited
will
be
entirely
at
your
discretion
it
is
of
course
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
you
will
seek
quiet
localities
trusting
to
hear
from
you
at
your
very
earliest
convenience
believe
me
yours
sincerely
timothy
welsh
looked
at
his
friend
with
the
respect
that
prosperity
naturally
excites
he
smiled
on
him
as
an
equal
and
cried
heartily
congratulations
again
when
do
you
start
twiddel
fidgeted
uncomfortably
you
haven
t
made
up
my
mind
what
s
the
matter
hang
it
fact
is
i
don
t
altogether
like
the
scruples
of
any
kind
always
surprised
welsh
can
t
afford
to
leave
the
practice
he
asked
with
a
laugh
that
the
reason
replied
twiddel
uncomfortably
rot
old
man
there
s
a
girl
in
the
case
out
with
it
no
it
isn
t
that
you
see
it
s
the
very
devil
of
a
at
this
confession
of
weakness
he
looked
guiltily
at
his
heroic
friend
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
wished
he
had
screwed
up
his
courage
in
private
welsh
had
so
little
imagination
by
gad
exclaimed
welsh
i
d
manage
a
nunnery
for
i
daresay
you
would
but
a
suicidal
and
possibly
homicidal
lunatic
isn
t
a
welsh
looked
at
his
friend
with
diminished
respect
then
you
are
going
to
chuck
up
and
a
free
trip
on
the
continent
he
said
dr
watson
himself
admits
the
with
is
it
young
man
only
when
in
possession
of
his
proper
faculties
said
the
doctor
dismally
and
an
amiable
disposition
with
suicidal
tendencies
hang
it
i
should
have
thought
said
welsh
with
a
laugh
that
they
would
only
matter
to
but
he
is
homicidal
at
least
it
s
doubtful
i
want
to
know
a
little
more
about
that
thank
you
what
is
the
man
s
name
sounds
aristocratic
he
might
come
in
useful
afterwards
when
he
s
welsh
spoke
with
an
air
of
reflection
which
might
have
been
entirely
disinterested
he
d
probably
commit
suicide
first
said
twiddel
and
of
course
i
d
get
all
the
or
homicide
replied
welsh
when
no
he
wouldn
s
the
worst
of
it
i
d
be
blamed
for
having
my
own
throat
twiddel
said
his
friend
deliberately
it
seems
to
me
you
re
a
i
m
at
least
alive
cried
twiddel
warming
with
sympathy
for
himself
which
i
probably
wouldn
t
be
for
long
in
mr
essington
s
i
don
t
blame
your
nerves
dear
boy
said
welsh
with
a
smile
that
showed
all
his
teeth
only
your
head
here
are
going
there
must
be
some
he
paused
deep
in
reflection
how
would
it
do
he
remarked
in
a
minute
if
were
to
go
in
your
place
twiddel
laughed
and
shook
his
head
couldn
t
be
managed
couldn
t
possibly
i
m
no
said
welsh
i
foresee
he
fished
a
pipe
out
of
his
pocket
filled
and
lit
it
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
gazing
at
the
ceiling
twiddel
my
boy
he
said
at
length
will
you
give
me
a
percentage
of
the
fee
if
i
think
of
a
safe
dodge
for
getting
the
money
and
preserving
your
throat
twiddel
laughed
rather
he
said
i
am
perfectly
serious
replied
welsh
keenly
i
m
certain
the
thing
is
quite
he
half
closed
his
eyes
and
ruminated
in
silence
the
doctor
watched
afraid
somehow
or
other
he
felt
that
he
was
already
a
kind
of
guy
fawkes
there
was
something
so
unlawful
in
welsh
s
expression
they
sat
there
without
speaking
for
about
ten
minutes
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
welsh
sprang
up
with
a
shout
of
laughter
slapping
first
his
own
leg
and
then
the
doctor
s
back
by
gad
i
ve
got
it
he
cried
i
have
it
and
he
had
hence
this
tale
part
i
chapter
i
in
a
certain
fertile
and
county
of
england
there
stands
a
high
stone
wall
on
a
sunny
day
the
eye
of
the
traveller
passing
through
this
province
is
gratified
by
the
sparkle
of
myriads
of
broken
bottles
arranged
closely
and
continuously
along
its
above
these
shining
facets
the
boughs
of
tall
trees
swing
in
the
wind
and
throw
their
shadows
across
the
highway
the
wall
at
last
leaves
the
road
and
follows
the
park
round
its
entire
extent
its
height
never
varies
the
broken
bottles
glitter
perpetually
and
only
through
two
entrances
and
that
when
the
gates
are
open
can
one
gain
a
single
glimpse
inside
for
the
gates
are
solid
with
no
chinks
for
the
curious
the
country
all
round
is
undulating
and
here
and
there
from
the
crest
of
an
eminence
you
can
see
a
great
space
of
park
land
within
this
wall
and
in
winter
when
the
leaves
are
off
the
trees
you
may
spy
an
imposing
mansion
in
the
midst
any
native
will
inform
you
with
a
mixture
of
infectious
awe
and
becoming
pride
that
this
is
no
less
than
the
private
asylum
of
clankwood
this
ideal
institution
bore
the
enviable
reputation
of
containing
the
lunatics
in
england
it
was
credibly
reported
that
however
well
marked
their
symptoms
and
however
well
developed
their
delusions
none
but
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
most
unblemished
descent
were
permitted
to
enjoy
its
seclusion
the
dances
there
were
universally
considered
the
most
agreeable
functions
in
the
county
the
conversation
of
many
of
the
inmates
was
of
the
widest
range
and
the
most
refreshing
originality
and
the
demeanour
of
all
even
when
most
free
from
the
conventional
trammels
of
outside
society
bore
evidence
of
an
expensive
and
in
some
cases
of
a
christian
upbringing
this
is
scarcely
to
be
wondered
at
when
beneath
one
roof
were
assembled
the
to
three
dukedoms
two
suicidal
marquises
an
odd
archbishop
or
so
and
the
flower
of
the
baronetage
and
clergy
as
this
list
only
includes
a
few
of
the
celebrities
able
or
willing
to
be
introduced
to
distinguished
visitors
and
makes
no
mention
of
the
uncorroborated
dignities
such
as
the
classical
divinities
and
old
testament
duplicates
the
anxiety
shown
by
some
people
to
certify
their
relations
can
easily
be
understood
dr
congleton
the
proprietor
and
physician
of
clankwood
was
a
gentleman
singularly
well
fitted
to
act
as
host
on
the
occasion
of
asylum
reunions
no
one
could
exceed
him
in
the
respect
he
showed
to
a
coroneted
head
even
when
cracked
and
a
bishop
under
his
charge
was
always
secured
as
far
as
possible
from
the
least
whisper
of
heretical
conversation
he
possessed
besides
a
pleasant
rubicund
countenance
and
an
immaculate
wardrobe
he
was
further
fortunate
in
having
in
his
assistants
dr
escott
and
dr
sherlaw
two
young
gentlemen
whose
medical
knowledge
was
almost
equal
to
the
affability
of
their
manners
and
the
excellence
of
their
family
connections
one
november
night
these
two
were
sitting
over
a
comfortable
fire
in
sherlaw
s
room
twelve
o
clock
struck
escott
finished
the
remains
of
something
in
a
tumbler
rose
and
yawned
sleepily
time
to
turn
in
young
man
said
he
i
suppose
it
is
replied
sherlaw
a
very
pleasant
and
boyish
young
gentleman
hullo
what
s
that
a
cab
they
both
listened
and
some
way
off
they
could
just
pick
out
a
sound
like
wheels
upon
gravel
it
s
very
late
for
any
one
to
be
coming
in
said
escott
the
sound
grew
clearer
and
more
unmistakably
like
a
cab
rattling
quickly
up
the
drive
it
is
a
cab
said
sherlaw
they
heard
it
draw
up
before
the
front
door
and
then
there
came
a
pause
who
the
deuce
can
it
be
muttered
escott
in
a
few
minutes
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
servant
entered
a
new
case
sir
want
s
to
see
dr
congleton
a
man
or
a
woman
man
all
right
growled
sherlaw
i
ll
come
confound
bad
luck
old
man
laughed
escott
i
ll
wait
here
in
case
by
any
chance
you
want
he
fell
into
his
chair
again
lit
a
cigarette
and
sleepily
turned
over
the
pages
of
a
book
dr
sherlaw
was
away
for
a
little
time
and
when
he
returned
his
cheerful
face
wore
a
somewhat
mystified
expression
well
asked
escott
rather
a
rum
case
said
his
colleague
thoughtfully
what
s
the
matter
don
t
who
was
it
don
t
know
that
escott
opened
his
eyes
what
happened
then
well
said
sherlaw
drawing
his
chair
up
to
the
fire
again
i
ll
tell
you
just
what
did
happen
and
you
can
make
what
you
can
out
of
it
of
course
i
suppose
it
s
all
right
really
the
proceedings
were
a
little
unusual
don
t
you
know
i
went
down
to
the
door
and
there
i
found
a
with
a
man
standing
beside
it
the
door
of
the
cab
was
shut
and
there
seemed
to
be
two
more
men
inside
this
chap
who
d
got
youngish
me
at
once
as
though
he
d
bought
the
whole
place
you
dr
congleton
damn
your
impertinence
i
said
to
myself
ringing
people
up
at
this
hour
and
talking
like
a
bally
i
told
him
politely
i
wasn
t
old
congers
but
that
i
d
make
a
good
enough
substitute
for
the
likes
of
him
i
tell
you
what
it
is
said
the
johnnie
i
ve
brought
a
patient
for
dr
congleton
a
cousin
of
mine
and
i
ve
got
a
doctor
here
too
i
want
to
see
dr
he
s
probably
in
bed
i
said
but
i
ll
do
just
as
well
i
suppose
he
s
certified
and
all
oh
it
s
all
right
said
the
man
rather
as
though
he
expected
me
to
say
that
it
wasn
t
he
looked
a
little
doubtful
what
to
do
and
then
i
heard
some
one
inside
the
cab
call
him
he
stuck
his
head
in
the
window
and
they
confabbed
for
a
minute
and
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
with
the
most
magnificent
air
you
ever
saw
like
a
chap
buying
a
set
of
diamond
studs
my
friend
here
is
a
great
personal
friend
of
dr
congleton
and
it
s
a
i
mean
it
s
an
uncommonly
delicate
matter
we
must
see
well
if
you
insist
i
ll
see
if
i
can
get
him
i
said
but
you
d
better
come
in
and
so
the
johnnie
opened
the
door
of
the
cab
and
there
was
a
great
hauling
and
pushing
my
friend
pulling
an
arm
from
the
outside
and
the
doctor
shoving
from
within
and
at
last
they
fetched
out
their
patient
he
was
a
tall
man
in
a
very
long
light
and
a
cap
with
a
large
peak
shoved
over
his
eyes
and
he
seemed
very
unsteady
on
his
pins
drunk
by
george
i
said
to
myself
at
first
the
out
after
him
and
they
each
took
an
arm
lugged
their
patient
into
the
and
popped
him
into
an
armchair
there
he
collapsed
and
sat
with
his
head
hanging
down
as
limp
as
a
sucked
orange
i
asked
them
if
anything
was
the
matter
with
him
only
tired
a
little
sleepy
said
the
cousin
and
do
you
know
escott
what
i
d
stake
my
best
boots
was
the
matter
with
him
what
the
man
was
drugged
escott
looked
at
the
fire
thoughtfully
well
he
said
it
s
quite
possible
he
might
have
been
too
violent
to
why
couldn
t
they
have
said
so
then
h
m
not
knowing
can
t
say
what
happened
next
next
thing
was
i
asked
the
doctor
what
name
i
should
give
he
answered
in
a
kind
of
nervous
way
no
name
you
needn
t
give
any
name
i
know
dr
congleton
personally
ask
him
to
come
so
off
i
tooled
and
found
old
congers
just
thinking
of
turning
in
my
clients
are
sometimes
unnecessarily
discreet
he
remarked
in
his
pompous
way
when
i
told
him
about
the
arrival
and
of
course
he
added
his
usual
platitude
about
our
reputation
for
discretion
i
went
back
with
him
to
the
and
just
stood
at
the
door
long
enough
to
see
him
hail
the
doctor
chap
very
cordially
and
be
introduced
to
the
patient
s
cousin
and
then
i
came
away
rather
rum
isn
t
it
you
ve
certainly
made
the
best
of
the
yarn
said
escott
with
a
laugh
by
george
if
you
d
been
there
you
d
have
thought
it
funny
well
i
m
off
we
ll
probably
hear
what
it
s
all
but
in
the
morning
there
was
little
more
to
be
learned
about
the
s
history
and
antecedents
dr
congleton
spoke
of
the
matter
to
the
two
young
men
with
the
pompous
cough
that
signified
extreme
discretion
brought
by
an
old
friend
of
mine
he
said
a
curious
story
escott
but
quite
intelligible
there
seem
to
be
the
best
reasons
for
answering
no
questions
about
him
you
understand
certainly
sir
said
the
two
assistants
with
the
more
assurance
as
they
had
no
information
to
give
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
mind
satisfied
added
their
chief
by
the
way
sir
sherlaw
ventured
to
remark
hadn
t
they
given
him
something
in
the
way
of
a
eh
indeed
i
hardly
think
so
sherlaw
i
hardly
think
so
case
of
reaction
entirely
good
congleton
seems
satisfied
remarked
escott
i
ll
tell
you
what
said
the
junior
profoundly
old
congers
is
a
very
good
chap
and
all
that
but
he
s
not
what
i
should
call
extra
sharp
should
feel
uncommon
h
m
replied
escott
as
you
say
our
worthy
chief
is
not
extra
sharp
but
that
s
not
our
business
after
chapter
ii
by
the
way
said
escott
a
couple
of
days
later
how
is
your
mysterious
man
getting
on
i
haven
t
seen
him
myself
sherlaw
laughed
he
s
turning
out
a
regular
sportsman
by
george
for
the
first
day
he
was
more
or
less
in
the
same
state
in
which
he
arrived
then
he
began
to
wake
up
and
ask
questions
what
the
devil
is
this
place
he
said
to
me
in
the
evening
it
may
sound
profane
but
he
was
very
polite
i
assure
you
i
told
him
and
he
sort
of
raised
his
eyebrows
smiled
and
thanked
me
like
a
prime
minister
acknowledging
an
obligation
since
then
he
has
steadily
developed
sporting
not
to
say
frisky
tastes
he
went
out
this
morning
and
in
five
minutes
had
his
arm
round
one
of
the
prettiest
nurses
waist
and
she
didn
t
seem
to
mind
much
either
by
george
he
ll
want
a
bit
of
looking
after
i
take
seems
to
me
he
is
uncommonly
capable
of
taking
care
of
himself
the
rest
of
the
establishment
will
want
looking
after
from
this
time
forth
the
mysterious
gentleman
began
to
regularly
take
the
air
and
to
be
remarked
and
having
once
remarked
him
people
looked
again
mr
francis
beveridge
for
such
it
appeared
was
his
name
was
distinguished
even
for
clankwood
though
his
antecedents
were
involved
in
mystery
so
much
confidence
was
placed
in
dr
congleton
s
discrimination
that
the
unknown
stranger
was
at
once
received
on
the
most
friendly
terms
by
every
one
and
to
tell
the
truth
it
would
have
been
hard
to
repulse
him
for
long
his
manner
was
perfect
his
conversation
witty
to
the
extremest
verge
of
propriety
and
his
clothes
fashionable
in
cut
and
of
unquestionable
fit
bore
on
such
of
the
buttons
as
were
made
of
metal
the
hall
mark
of
a
leading
london
firm
he
wore
the
longest
and
most
silky
moustaches
ever
seen
and
beneath
them
a
short
beard
completed
his
the
ladies
king
charles
of
unhappy
memory
the
melancholic
mr
jones
quondam
author
of
lyrical
medley
declared
indeed
that
for
mr
beveridge
shaving
was
prohibited
and
darkly
whispered
suicidal
but
his
opinion
was
held
of
little
account
it
was
upon
a
morning
about
a
week
after
his
arrival
that
dr
escott
alone
in
the
saw
him
enter
escott
had
by
this
time
made
his
acquaintance
and
like
almost
everybody
else
had
already
succumbed
to
the
fascination
of
his
address
good
morning
doctor
he
said
i
wish
you
to
do
me
a
trifling
favour
a
mere
bending
of
your
escott
laughed
i
shall
be
delighted
what
is
it
mr
beveridge
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
and
displayed
his
i
only
want
you
to
be
good
enough
to
read
the
inscription
written
the
doctor
bent
down
francis
beveridge
he
said
that
s
all
i
and
that
s
all
i
see
said
mr
beveridge
now
what
can
you
read
here
i
am
not
troubling
you
he
held
out
his
handkerchief
as
he
spoke
not
a
bit
laughed
the
doctor
but
i
only
see
francis
beveridge
here
too
i
m
everything
has
got
it
said
mr
beveridge
shaking
his
head
it
would
be
hard
to
say
whether
humorously
or
sadly
francis
beveridge
on
everything
it
follows
i
suppose
that
i
am
francis
beveridge
what
else
asked
escott
who
was
much
amused
that
s
just
it
what
else
said
the
other
he
smiled
a
peculiarly
charming
smile
thanked
the
doctor
with
exaggerated
gratitude
and
strolled
out
again
he
is
a
rum
chap
reflected
escott
and
indeed
in
the
outside
world
he
might
safely
have
been
termed
rather
rum
but
here
in
this
backwater
so
full
of
the
oddest
flotsam
his
waywardness
was
rather
less
than
the
average
he
had
for
instance
a
diverting
habit
of
modifying
the
time
and
even
the
tune
of
the
hymns
on
sunday
and
he
confessed
to
having
kissed
all
the
nurses
and
housemaids
except
three
but
both
escott
and
sherlaw
declared
they
had
never
met
a
more
congenial
spirit
mr
beveridge
s
game
of
billiards
was
quite
remarkable
even
for
clankwood
where
the
enforced
leisure
of
many
of
the
noblemen
and
gentlemen
had
made
them
highly
proficient
on
the
spot
he
showed
every
promise
on
his
rare
opportunities
of
being
an
unusually
entertaining
small
hour
in
fact
he
was
evidently
a
man
whose
previous
career
whatever
it
might
have
been
and
his
own
statements
merely
served
to
increase
the
mystery
round
this
point
had
led
him
through
many
humorous
and
left
him
with
few
restrictive
prejudices
november
became
december
and
to
all
appearances
he
had
settled
down
in
his
new
residence
with
complete
resignation
when
that
unknowable
factor
that
upsets
so
many
calculations
came
upon
the
scene
factor
i
mean
that
wears
a
petticoat
mr
beveridge
strolled
into
escott
s
room
one
morning
to
find
the
doctor
inspecting
a
mixed
assortment
of
white
kid
gloves
do
these
mean
past
or
future
conquests
he
asked
with
his
smile
both
laughed
the
doctor
i
m
trying
to
pick
out
a
clean
pair
for
the
dance
you
go
then
don
t
you
know
it
s
our
own
monthly
ball
here
of
course
said
mr
beveridge
passing
his
hand
quickly
across
his
brow
i
must
have
heard
but
things
pass
so
quickly
through
my
head
he
laughed
a
little
conventional
laugh
and
gazed
at
the
gloves
you
are
coming
of
course
said
escott
if
you
can
lend
me
a
pair
of
these
can
you
spare
one
help
yourself
replied
the
doctor
mr
beveridge
selected
a
pair
with
the
care
of
a
man
who
is
particular
in
such
matters
put
them
in
his
pocket
thanked
the
doctor
and
went
out
hope
he
doesn
t
play
the
fool
thought
escott
invitations
to
the
balls
at
clankwood
were
naturally
in
great
demand
throughout
the
county
for
nowhere
were
noblemen
so
numerous
and
divinities
so
tangible
carriages
and
pairs
rolled
up
one
after
another
the
mansion
glittered
with
lights
the
strains
of
the
band
could
be
heard
loud
and
stirring
or
low
and
faintly
all
through
the
house
who
is
that
man
dancing
opposite
my
daughter
asked
the
countess
of
grillyer
a
mr
beveridge
replied
dr
congleton
mr
beveridge
in
fact
the
mark
of
all
eyes
was
dancing
in
a
set
of
lancers
the
couple
opposite
to
him
consisted
of
a
stout
elderly
gentleman
who
doubtless
for
the
best
reasons
styled
himself
the
emperor
of
the
two
americas
and
a
charming
little
pink
and
flaxen
lady
alicia
à
fyre
as
everybody
who
was
anybody
could
have
told
you
the
handsome
stranger
moved
as
might
be
expected
with
his
accustomed
grace
and
air
of
distinction
and
probably
to
convince
his
admirers
that
there
was
nothing
meretricious
in
his
performance
he
carried
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
whole
time
this
certainly
caused
a
little
inconvenience
to
his
partner
but
to
be
characteristic
in
clankwood
one
had
to
step
very
far
out
of
the
beaten
track
for
two
figures
the
emperor
snorted
disapproval
but
at
the
end
of
the
third
when
mr
beveridge
had
been
skipping
round
the
outskirts
of
the
set
his
hands
still
thrust
out
of
sight
somewhat
to
the
derangement
of
the
customary
procedure
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
hey
young
man
he
asked
in
his
most
stentorian
voice
as
the
music
ceased
are
you
afraid
of
having
your
pockets
picked
alas
replied
mr
beveridge
it
would
take
two
men
to
do
huh
snorted
the
emperor
you
are
so
strong
are
you
i
mean
answered
his
with
his
polite
smile
that
it
would
take
one
man
to
put
something
in
and
another
to
take
it
this
remark
not
only
turned
the
laugh
entirely
on
mr
beveridge
s
side
but
it
introduced
the
upsetting
factor
chapter
iii
the
lady
alicia
à
fyre
though
of
the
outer
everyday
world
herself
had
in
common
with
most
families
of
any
pretensions
to
ancient
dignity
a
creditable
sprinkling
of
uncles
and
cousins
domiciled
in
clankwood
and
so
she
frequently
attended
these
dances
her
eye
had
been
caught
by
a
tall
graceful
figure
executing
a
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
its
hands
in
its
pockets
the
face
of
this
gentleman
was
so
composed
and
handsome
and
he
seemed
so
oblivious
to
the
presence
of
everybody
else
that
her
interest
was
immediately
excited
during
the
set
of
lancers
in
which
he
was
her
she
watched
him
furtively
with
a
growing
feeling
of
admiration
she
had
never
heard
him
say
a
word
and
it
was
with
a
sensation
of
the
liveliest
interest
that
she
listened
to
his
brief
passage
with
her
partner
at
his
final
retort
her
tender
heart
was
overcome
with
pity
he
was
poor
then
or
at
least
he
was
allowed
the
use
of
no
money
and
all
of
him
that
was
outside
his
pockets
seemed
so
sane
and
so
gentlemanly
it
seemed
a
pity
to
let
him
lack
a
little
sympathy
the
lady
alicia
might
be
described
as
a
becoming
frock
stuffed
with
sentiment
through
a
pair
of
large
blue
eyes
she
drank
in
romance
and
with
the
reddest
and
most
undecided
of
lips
she
felt
a
vague
desire
to
kiss
something
at
the
end
of
the
dance
she
managed
by
a
series
of
little
manœuvres
to
find
herself
standing
close
to
his
elbow
she
sighed
twice
but
he
still
seemed
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
then
with
a
heroic
effort
she
summed
up
her
courage
and
said
in
a
low
and
rather
shaky
voice
are
mr
beveridge
turned
and
looked
down
on
her
with
great
interest
her
eyes
met
his
for
a
moment
and
straightway
sought
the
floor
thus
she
saw
nothing
of
a
smile
that
came
and
went
like
the
shadow
of
a
puff
of
smoke
he
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
folded
his
arms
and
with
an
air
of
the
deepest
dejection
sighed
heavily
she
took
courage
and
looked
up
again
and
then
as
he
only
gazed
into
space
in
the
most
romantically
melancholy
fashion
and
made
no
answer
she
asked
again
very
timidly
is
the
matter
without
saying
a
word
mr
beveridge
bent
courteously
and
offered
her
his
right
arm
she
took
it
with
the
most
delicious
trepidation
glancing
round
hurriedly
to
see
whether
the
countess
noticed
her
another
dance
was
just
beginning
and
in
the
general
movement
her
mysterious
acquaintance
led
her
without
observation
to
a
seat
in
the
window
of
a
corridor
there
he
pressed
her
hand
gently
stroked
his
long
moustaches
for
a
minute
and
then
said
with
an
air
of
reflection
there
are
three
ways
of
making
a
woman
like
one
i
am
slightly
out
of
practice
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
suggest
a
method
of
procedure
such
a
beginning
was
so
wholly
unexpected
that
lady
alicia
could
only
give
a
little
gasp
of
consternation
her
companion
after
pausing
an
instant
for
a
reply
went
on
in
the
same
tone
i
am
aware
that
i
have
begun
well
i
attracted
your
attention
i
elicited
your
sympathy
and
i
pressed
your
hand
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
t
remember
what
i
generally
do
poor
lady
alicia
who
had
come
with
a
bucketful
of
sympathy
ready
to
be
gulped
down
by
this
unfortunate
gentleman
was
only
able
to
stammer
really
don
t
know
hamilton
said
mr
beveridge
unblushingly
at
least
that
name
belongs
to
me
as
much
as
anything
can
be
said
to
in
a
world
where
my
creditors
claim
my
money
and
dr
congleton
my
you
are
confined
and
poor
you
mean
asked
lady
alicia
beginning
to
see
her
way
again
poor
and
confined
to
put
them
in
their
proper
order
for
if
i
had
the
wherewithal
to
purchase
a
balloon
i
should
certainly
cease
to
be
his
admirer
found
it
hard
to
reply
adequately
to
this
and
mr
beveridge
continued
to
return
to
the
delicate
subject
from
which
we
strayed
what
would
you
like
me
to
do
my
arm
round
your
waist
relate
my
troubles
or
turn
my
back
on
you
those
the
three
ways
you
spoke
make
women
like
you
i
mean
lady
alicia
ventured
to
ask
though
she
was
beginning
to
wish
the
sofa
was
larger
they
are
examples
of
the
three
classical
methods
cuddling
humbugging
and
piquing
which
do
you
prefer
tell
me
about
troubles
she
answered
gaining
courage
a
little
you
belong
to
the
sex
which
makes
no
mention
of
figs
and
spades
he
rejoined
but
i
understand
you
to
mean
that
you
prefer
he
drew
a
long
face
sighed
twice
and
looking
tenderly
into
lady
alicia
s
blue
eyes
began
in
a
gentle
reminiscent
voice
my
boyhood
was
troubled
and
unhappy
no
kind
words
no
caresses
i
was
beaten
by
a
cruel
stepfather
ignored
and
insulted
for
my
physical
deformities
by
a
heartless
he
stopped
to
sigh
again
and
lady
alicia
with
a
boldness
that
surprised
herself
and
a
perspicacity
that
would
have
surprised
her
friends
asked
how
could
mean
were
they
step
several
steps
he
replied
in
fact
quite
a
long
with
this
explanation
lady
alicia
was
forced
to
remain
satisfied
but
as
he
had
paused
a
second
time
and
seemed
to
be
immersed
in
the
study
of
his
shoes
she
inquired
again
you
spoke
of
physical
infirmities
do
you
deformities
he
corrected
up
to
the
age
of
fourteen
years
i
could
only
walk
sideways
and
my
hair
parted
in
the
he
spoke
so
seriously
that
these
unusual
maladies
seemed
to
her
the
most
touching
misfortunes
she
had
ever
heard
of
she
murmured
gently
yes
as
the
years
advanced
mr
beveridge
continued
and
i
became
more
nearly
the
same
weight
as
my
stepfather
my
life
grew
happier
it
was
decided
to
send
me
to
college
so
i
was
provided
with
an
insufficient
cheque
a
complete
set
of
plated
forks
and
three
and
despatched
to
the
university
of
oxford
at
least
i
think
that
was
the
name
of
the
corporation
which
took
my
money
and
endeavoured
to
restrict
my
habits
though
to
confess
the
truth
my
memory
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
there
i
learned
wisdom
by
the
practice
of
most
amusing
and
effective
method
my
tutor
used
to
tell
me
i
had
some
originality
i
apologised
for
its
presence
in
such
a
respectable
institution
and
undertook
to
pass
an
examination
instead
i
believe
i
succeeded
i
certainly
remember
giving
a
dinner
to
celebrate
something
thereupon
at
my
own
expense
the
university
inflicted
a
degree
upon
me
but
i
was
shortly
afterwards
compensated
by
the
death
of
my
uncle
and
my
accession
to
his
estates
having
enjoyed
a
university
education
and
accordingly
possessing
a
corrected
and
regulated
sentiment
i
was
naturally
inconsolable
at
the
decease
of
this
venerable
relative
who
for
so
long
had
shown
a
kindly
interest
in
the
poor
orphan
he
stopped
to
sigh
again
and
lady
alicia
asked
with
great
interest
but
your
you
always
had
them
hadn
t
you
never
he
replied
sadly
never
she
exclaimed
in
some
bewilderment
certainly
not
often
he
answered
and
oftener
than
not
never
if
you
had
told
me
beforehand
you
wished
to
hear
my
history
i
should
have
pruned
my
family
tree
into
a
more
presentable
shape
but
if
you
will
kindly
tell
me
as
i
go
along
which
of
my
relatives
you
disapprove
of
and
who
you
would
like
to
be
introduced
i
shall
arrange
the
plot
to
suit
i
only
wish
to
hear
the
true
story
mr
fortescue
he
corrected
i
certainly
prefer
to
be
called
by
one
name
at
a
time
but
never
by
the
same
twice
he
smiled
so
agreeably
as
he
said
this
that
lady
alicia
though
puzzled
and
a
little
hurt
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
back
let
me
hear
the
rest
she
said
it
is
no
truer
than
the
first
part
but
quite
as
entertaining
so
if
you
like
i
shall
endeavour
to
recall
the
series
of
painful
episodes
that
brought
me
to
clankwood
he
answered
very
seriously
lady
alicia
settled
herself
comfortably
into
one
corner
of
the
sofa
and
prepared
to
feel
affected
but
at
that
moment
the
portly
form
of
dr
congleton
appeared
from
the
direction
of
the
ballroom
with
a
still
more
portly
dowager
on
his
arm
my
mother
exclaimed
lady
alicia
rising
quickly
to
her
feet
indeed
said
mr
beveridge
who
still
kept
his
seat
she
certainly
looks
handsome
this
speech
made
lady
alicia
blush
very
becomingly
and
the
countess
looked
at
her
sharply
where
have
you
been
alicia
the
room
was
rather
warm
mamma
in
short
madam
interrupted
mr
beveridge
rising
and
bowing
your
charming
daughter
wished
to
study
a
lunatic
at
close
quarters
i
am
mad
and
i
obligingly
raved
he
ran
one
hand
through
his
hair
so
as
to
make
it
fall
over
his
eyes
blew
out
his
cheeks
and
uttering
a
yell
sprang
high
into
the
air
and
descended
in
a
sitting
posture
on
the
floor
that
madam
is
a
very
common
symptom
he
explained
with
a
smile
smoothing
down
his
hair
again
as
our
friend
dr
congleton
will
tell
both
the
doctor
and
the
countess
were
too
astonished
to
make
any
reply
so
he
turned
again
to
lady
alicia
and
offering
his
arm
said
let
me
lead
you
back
to
our
is
he
safe
whispered
the
countess
believe
so
replied
dr
congleton
in
some
confusion
but
i
shall
have
him
watched
more
as
they
entered
the
room
mr
beveridge
whispered
will
you
meet
a
poor
lunatic
again
and
the
lady
alicia
pressed
his
arm
chapter
iv
on
the
morning
after
the
dance
dr
congleton
summoned
dr
escott
to
his
room
escott
he
began
we
must
keep
a
little
sharper
eye
on
mr
indeed
sir
said
escott
he
seems
to
me
harmless
nevertheless
he
must
be
watched
lady
grillyer
was
considerably
alarmed
by
his
conduct
last
night
and
a
client
who
has
confided
so
many
of
her
relatives
to
my
care
must
be
treated
with
the
greatest
regard
i
receive
pheasants
at
christmas
from
no
fewer
than
fourteen
families
of
title
and
my
reputation
for
discretion
is
too
valuable
to
be
risked
when
mr
beveridge
is
not
under
your
own
eyes
you
must
see
that
moggridge
always
keeps
him
in
accordingly
moggridge
a
burly
and
seasoned
attendant
on
refractory
patients
was
told
off
to
keep
an
unobtrusive
eye
on
that
accomplished
gentleman
his
duties
appeared
light
enough
for
as
i
have
said
mr
beveridge
s
eccentricities
had
hitherto
been
merely
of
the
most
playful
nature
after
luncheon
on
this
same
day
he
gave
escott
twelve
breaks
and
a
beating
at
billiards
and
then
having
borrowed
and
approved
of
one
of
his
cigars
he
strolled
into
the
park
if
he
intended
to
escape
observation
he
certainly
showed
the
most
skilful
strategy
for
he
dodged
deviously
through
the
largest
trees
and
at
last
after
a
roundabout
ramble
struck
a
sheltered
walk
that
ran
underneath
the
high
outer
wall
it
was
a
sunny
winter
afternoon
the
boughs
were
stripped
and
the
leaves
lay
littered
on
the
walk
or
flickered
and
stirred
through
the
grass
in
this
spot
the
high
trees
stood
so
close
and
the
bare
branches
were
so
thick
that
there
was
still
an
air
of
quiet
and
seclusion
where
he
paced
and
smoked
every
now
and
then
he
stopped
and
listened
and
looked
at
his
watch
and
as
he
walked
backwards
and
forwards
an
amused
smile
would
come
and
go
all
at
once
he
heard
something
move
on
the
far
side
of
the
wall
he
paused
to
make
sure
and
then
he
whistled
the
sounds
outside
ceased
and
in
a
moment
something
fell
softly
behind
him
he
turned
quickly
and
snatched
up
a
little
buttonhole
of
flowers
with
a
still
smaller
note
tied
to
the
stems
an
uncommonly
happy
idea
he
said
to
himself
looking
at
the
missive
with
the
air
of
one
versed
in
these
matters
then
he
leisurely
proceeded
to
unfold
and
read
the
note
to
my
friend
he
read
if
i
may
call
you
a
friend
since
i
have
known
you
only
a
short
i
this
is
just
to
express
my
sympathy
and
although
i
can
not
express
it
well
still
perhaps
you
will
forgive
my
feeble
effort
at
this
point
just
as
he
was
regarding
the
double
mark
of
exclamation
with
reminiscent
entertainment
a
plaintive
voice
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
cried
in
a
stage
whisper
have
you
got
it
mr
beveridge
composed
his
face
and
heaving
his
shoulders
to
his
ears
in
the
effort
gave
vent
to
a
prodigious
sigh
a
million
thanks
my
fairest
and
kindest
of
friends
he
answered
in
the
same
tone
i
read
it
now
i
drink
it
in
he
kissed
the
back
of
his
hand
loudly
two
or
three
times
sighed
again
and
continued
his
reading
i
wish
i
could
help
you
it
ran
but
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
as
the
world
is
is
it
not
so
you
must
accept
a
friend
s
sympathy
if
it
does
not
seem
to
you
too
bold
and
forward
of
her
perhaps
we
may
meet
again
as
i
sometimes
go
to
clankwood
sympathetic
he
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
then
he
exclaimed
in
an
audible
aside
his
voice
shaking
with
the
most
affecting
thrill
we
may
meet
again
only
o
alicia
and
then
dropping
again
into
a
stage
whisper
he
asked
are
you
still
there
lady
alicia
a
timorous
voice
replied
yes
mr
fortescue
but
i
really
go
now
now
so
soon
i
have
stayed
too
long
tis
better
to
have
stayed
too
long
than
never
to
wear
stays
at
all
replied
mr
beveridge
there
was
no
response
for
a
moment
then
a
low
voice
a
little
hurt
and
a
good
deal
puzzled
asked
with
evident
hesitation
did
you
say
mr
fortescue
i
said
that
lady
alicia
s
stay
can
not
be
too
long
he
answered
softly
what
good
can
i
be
the
good
you
can
not
help
there
was
another
moment
s
pause
then
the
voice
whispered
i
don
t
quite
understand
my
alicia
understands
me
not
mr
beveridge
soliloquised
in
another
audible
aside
aloud
or
rather
in
a
little
lower
tone
he
answered
i
am
friendless
poor
and
imprisoned
what
is
the
good
in
your
staying
ah
lady
alicia
but
why
should
i
detain
you
go
fair
friend
go
and
forget
poor
francis
beveridge
there
came
a
soft
surprised
answer
francis
beveridge
alas
you
have
guessed
my
secret
yes
that
is
the
name
of
the
unhappiest
of
as
he
spoke
these
melancholy
words
he
threw
away
the
stump
of
his
cigar
took
another
from
his
case
and
bit
off
the
end
the
voice
replied
i
shall
remember
my
mr
beveridge
struck
a
match
h
sh
whatever
is
that
cried
the
voice
in
alarm
a
heart
breaking
he
replied
lighting
his
cigar
don
t
talk
like
that
said
the
voice
distresses
there
was
a
break
in
the
voice
and
alas
between
distress
and
consolation
there
are
fifteen
perpendicular
feet
of
stone
and
mortar
and
the
relics
of
twelve
hundred
bottles
of
bass
he
replied
perhaps
voice
perhaps
we
may
see
each
other
some
say
at
four
o
clock
he
suggested
pertinently
if
you
could
manage
to
be
passing
up
the
drive
at
that
there
was
another
pause
the
voice
began
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
sharp
crack
of
a
branch
behind
him
and
turning
instantly
he
spied
the
uncompromising
countenance
of
moggridge
peering
round
a
tree
about
twenty
paces
distant
lack
of
presence
of
mind
and
quick
decision
were
not
amongst
mr
beveridge
s
failings
he
struck
a
theatrical
attitude
at
once
and
began
in
a
loud
voice
gazing
up
at
the
tops
of
the
trees
he
comes
a
stranger
comes
yes
my
fair
friend
we
may
meet
again
but
only
for
a
while
ah
that
a
breaking
heart
should
be
lit
for
a
moment
and
then
the
lamp
be
put
out
meanwhile
moggridge
was
walking
towards
him
ha
moggridge
he
cried
good
time
you
was
goin
in
sir
said
moggridge
stolidly
and
to
himself
he
muttered
he
s
crackeder
than
i
thought
and
to
hisself
just
as
well
i
kept
a
heye
on
like
most
clever
people
mr
beveridge
generally
followed
the
line
of
least
resistance
he
slipped
his
arm
through
his
attendant
s
shouted
a
farewell
apparently
to
some
imaginary
divinity
overhead
and
turned
towards
the
house
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
he
remarked
yes
sir
replied
moggridge
funny
thing
your
turning
up
out
for
a
walk
i
suppose
for
a
stroll
s
to
he
stopped
that
on
these
chilly
afternoons
the
dear
good
doctor
is
afraid
of
my
health
that
s
kind
o
it
but
of
course
i
m
not
supposed
to
notice
anything
eh
moggridge
looked
a
trifle
uncomfortable
and
was
discreetly
silent
mr
beveridge
smiled
at
his
own
perspicacity
and
then
began
in
the
most
friendly
tone
well
i
feel
flattered
that
so
stout
a
man
has
been
told
off
to
take
care
of
me
what
an
arm
you
ve
got
pretty
fair
sir
said
moggridge
complacently
and
i
am
thankful
too
continued
mr
beveridge
that
you
re
a
man
of
some
sense
there
are
a
lot
of
fools
in
the
world
moggridge
and
i
m
somewhat
of
an
epicure
in
the
matter
of
mine
as
been
considered
pretty
sharp
moggridge
admitted
with
a
gratified
relaxation
of
his
wooden
countenance
have
a
cigar
his
patient
asked
taking
out
his
case
thank
you
sir
i
don
t
mind
if
i
you
will
find
it
a
capital
smoke
i
don
t
throw
them
away
on
every
moggridge
completely
thawed
lit
his
cigar
and
slackened
his
pace
for
such
frank
appreciation
of
his
merits
was
rare
in
a
critical
world
you
can
perhaps
believe
moggridge
said
mr
beveridge
reflectively
that
one
doesn
t
often
have
the
chance
of
talking
confidentially
to
a
man
of
sense
in
no
sir
i
should
himagine
and
so
one
has
sometimes
to
talk
to
this
was
said
so
sadly
that
moggridge
began
to
feel
uncomfortably
affected
ah
moggridge
one
can
not
always
keep
silence
even
when
one
least
wants
to
be
overheard
have
you
ever
been
in
love
moggridge
the
burly
keeper
changed
countenance
a
little
at
this
embarrassingly
direct
question
and
answered
diffidently
well
sir
to
be
sure
men
is
men
and
woming
will
be
the
deuce
they
will
replied
mr
beveridge
cordially
and
it
s
rather
hard
to
forget
em
eh
hindeed
it
is
i
remembered
this
afternoon
but
i
should
like
you
as
a
good
chap
to
forget
you
won
t
mention
my
moment
of
weakness
moggridge
no
sir
said
moggridge
stoutly
i
suppose
i
hought
to
report
what
i
sees
but
i
won
t
this
thank
you
said
mr
beveridge
pressing
his
arm
i
had
you
know
a
touch
of
the
sun
in
india
and
i
sometimes
talk
when
i
shouldn
t
though
after
all
that
isn
t
a
very
uncommon
and
so
it
happened
that
no
rumour
prejudicial
either
to
his
sanity
or
to
the
progress
of
his
friendship
with
the
lady
alicia
reached
the
ears
of
the
authorities
chapter
towards
four
o
clock
on
the
following
afternoon
mr
beveridge
and
moggridge
were
walking
leisurely
down
the
long
drive
leading
from
the
mansion
of
clankwood
to
the
gate
that
opened
on
the
humdrum
outer
world
finding
that
an
inelastic
matter
of
yards
was
all
the
tether
he
could
hope
for
mr
beveridge
thought
it
best
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
make
a
companion
of
this
necessity
so
he
kept
his
attendant
by
his
side
and
regaled
him
for
some
time
with
a
series
of
improbable
reminiscences
and
tolerable
cigars
till
at
last
round
a
bend
of
the
avenue
a
lady
on
horseback
came
into
view
as
she
drew
a
little
nearer
he
stopped
with
an
air
of
great
surprise
and
pleasure
i
believe
moggridge
that
must
be
lady
alicia
à
fyre
he
exclaimed
it
looks
huncommon
like
her
sir
replied
moggridge
i
must
really
speak
to
her
she
was
mr
beveridge
assumed
his
inimitable
air
of
manly
she
was
one
of
my
poor
mother
s
dearest
friends
do
you
mind
moggridge
falling
behind
a
little
in
fact
if
you
could
step
behind
a
tree
and
wait
here
for
me
it
would
be
pleasanter
for
us
both
we
used
to
meet
under
happier
circumstances
and
don
t
you
know
it
might
distress
her
to
be
reminded
of
my
such
a
reasonable
request
beseechingly
put
by
so
fine
a
gentleman
could
scarcely
be
refused
moggridge
retired
behind
the
trees
that
lined
the
avenue
and
mr
beveridge
advanced
alone
to
meet
the
lady
alicia
she
blushed
very
becomingly
as
he
raised
his
hat
i
hardly
expected
to
see
you
mr
beveridge
she
began
i
on
the
other
hand
have
been
thinking
of
nothing
else
he
replied
she
blushed
still
deeper
but
responded
a
little
reprovingly
it
s
very
polite
of
you
to
say
so
not
a
bit
said
he
i
have
a
dozen
equally
sentences
at
my
disposal
and
they
tell
me
a
most
deluding
way
of
saying
suddenly
out
of
her
depth
again
poor
lady
alicia
could
only
strike
out
at
random
who
tell
you
she
managed
to
say
first
so
far
as
my
poor
memory
goes
my
mother
s
lady
informed
me
of
the
fact
then
i
think
my
sister
s
governess
he
replied
ticking
off
his
informants
on
his
fingers
with
a
air
after
that
came
a
number
of
more
or
less
reliable
individuals
and
lastly
the
lady
alicia
à
me
i
m
sure
i
never
none
of
them
ever
he
interrupted
but
what
have
i
done
then
she
asked
tightening
her
reins
and
making
her
horse
fidget
a
foot
or
two
farther
away
you
have
begun
to
be
a
most
adorable
friend
to
a
most
unfortunate
still
lady
alicia
looked
at
him
a
little
dubiously
and
only
said
hope
i
m
not
too
there
are
no
degrees
in
friendly
he
replied
there
are
only
aloofly
friendly
and
more
than
think
i
ought
to
be
going
on
mr
that
experienced
diplomatist
perceived
that
it
was
necessary
to
further
embellish
himself
are
you
fond
of
soldiers
he
asked
abruptly
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
in
considerable
bewilderment
does
a
red
coat
a
medal
and
a
brass
band
appeal
to
you
are
you
apt
to
be
interested
in
her
majesty
s
army
i
generally
like
soldiers
she
admitted
still
much
surprised
at
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
then
i
was
a
i
held
a
commission
in
one
of
the
crackest
cavalry
regiments
he
began
dramatically
and
yet
with
a
great
air
of
sincerity
i
was
considered
one
of
the
most
promising
officers
in
the
mess
it
nearly
broke
my
heart
to
leave
the
he
turned
away
his
head
lady
alicia
was
visibly
affected
i
am
so
sorry
she
murmured
still
keeping
his
face
turned
away
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
pressed
it
gently
sorrow
can
not
give
me
my
freedom
he
said
if
there
is
anything
i
can
she
began
dismount
he
said
looking
up
at
her
tenderly
lady
alicia
never
quite
knew
how
it
happened
but
certainly
she
found
herself
standing
on
the
ground
and
the
next
moment
mr
beveridge
was
in
her
place
an
old
soldier
he
exclaimed
gaily
i
can
t
resist
the
temptation
of
having
a
and
with
that
he
started
at
a
gallop
towards
the
gate
with
a
blasphemous
ejaculation
moggridge
sprang
from
behind
his
tree
and
set
off
down
the
drive
in
hot
pursuit
lady
alicia
screamed
stop
stop
mean
mr
beveridge
stop
please
but
the
favorite
of
the
crack
regiment
despite
the
lady
s
saddle
sat
his
steed
well
and
rapidly
left
cries
and
footsteps
far
behind
the
lodge
was
nearly
half
a
mile
away
and
as
the
avenue
wound
between
palisades
of
old
trees
the
shouts
became
muffled
and
when
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
in
the
stretch
behind
him
no
sign
of
benefactress
or
pursuer
by
continued
exhortations
and
the
point
of
his
penknife
he
kept
his
horse
at
full
stretch
round
the
next
bend
he
knew
he
should
see
the
gates
five
to
one
on
the
blank
things
being
shut
he
muttered
he
swept
round
the
curve
and
there
ahead
of
him
he
saw
the
gates
grimly
closed
and
at
the
lodge
door
a
dismounted
groom
standing
beside
his
horse
only
remarking
damn
he
reined
up
turned
and
trotted
quietly
back
again
presently
he
met
moggridge
red
in
the
face
muddy
as
to
his
trousers
and
panting
hard
nice
little
nag
this
moggridge
he
remarked
airily
nice
sweat
you
ve
give
me
rejoined
his
attendant
wrathfully
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
ran
after
me
i
does
mean
to
say
moggridge
replied
grimly
seizing
the
reins
want
to
lead
him
very
makes
us
look
quite
like
the
derby
winner
coming
derby
loser
you
means
thanks
to
them
gates
bein
gates
shut
were
they
i
didn
t
happen
to
no
o
course
not
said
moggridge
sarcastically
that
there
sunstroke
you
got
in
india
prevented
you
i
suppose
have
a
cigar
to
this
overture
moggridge
made
no
reply
mr
beveridge
laughed
and
continued
lightly
i
had
no
idea
you
were
so
fond
of
exercise
i
d
have
given
you
a
lead
all
round
the
park
if
i
d
you
d
ave
given
me
a
lead
all
round
the
county
if
them
gates
ad
been
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
stop
this
fiery
animal
mr
beveridge
admitted
but
now
moggridge
the
run
is
over
i
think
i
can
take
lady
alicia
s
horse
back
to
her
moggridge
smiled
grimly
you
won
t
let
go
no
mr
beveridge
put
his
hand
behind
his
back
and
silently
drove
the
penknife
a
quarter
of
an
inch
into
his
mount
s
hind
quarters
in
an
instant
his
keeper
felt
himself
being
lifted
nearly
off
his
feet
and
in
another
actually
deposited
on
his
face
off
went
the
accomplished
horseman
again
at
top
speed
but
this
time
back
to
lady
alicia
he
saw
her
standing
by
the
side
of
the
drive
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
a
penitent
and
disconsolate
little
figure
when
she
heard
him
coming
she
dried
her
eyes
and
looked
up
but
her
face
was
still
tearful
well
i
am
back
from
my
ride
he
remarked
in
a
perfectly
usual
voice
dismounting
as
he
spoke
the
man
she
cried
where
is
that
dreadful
man
what
man
he
asked
in
some
surprise
the
man
who
chased
mr
beveridge
laughed
aloud
at
which
lady
alicia
took
fresh
refuge
in
her
handkerchief
he
follows
on
foot
he
replied
did
he
catch
you
oh
why
didn
t
you
escape
altogether
she
sobbed
mr
beveridge
looked
at
her
with
growing
interest
i
had
begun
to
forget
my
petticoat
psychology
he
reflected
aloud
after
his
unconventional
fashion
oh
here
he
comes
she
shuddered
all
blood
oh
what
have
you
done
to
him
on
my
honour
nothing
merely
haven
t
washed
his
by
this
time
moggridge
was
coming
close
upon
them
you
won
t
forget
a
poor
soldier
said
mr
beveridge
in
a
lower
voice
there
was
no
reply
a
soldier
he
added
with
a
sigh
glancing
at
her
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
so
poor
that
even
if
i
had
got
out
i
could
only
have
ridden
till
i
would
you
she
began
timidly
what
day
he
interrupted
hurriedly
tuesday
she
hesitated
four
o
clock
again
same
place
as
before
when
i
whistle
throw
it
over
at
before
they
had
time
to
say
more
moggridge
and
came
up
it
s
all
right
miss
he
said
coming
between
them
i
ll
see
that
he
plays
no
more
of
is
tricks
there
s
nothin
to
be
afrightened
stand
back
she
cried
don
t
come
near
me
moggridge
was
too
staggered
at
this
outburst
to
say
a
word
stand
away
she
said
and
the
bewildered
attendant
stood
away
she
turned
to
mr
beveridge
now
will
you
help
me
up
she
mounted
lightly
said
a
brief
farewell
and
forgetting
all
about
the
call
at
clankwood
she
had
ostensibly
come
to
pay
turned
her
horse
s
head
towards
the
lodge
well
i
m
blowed
said
moggridge
they
do
blow
one
his
patient
assented
naturally
enough
the
story
of
this
equestrian
adventure
soon
ran
through
clankwood
the
exact
particulars
however
were
a
little
hard
to
collect
for
while
moggridge
supplied
many
minute
and
picturesque
details
illustrating
his
own
activity
and
presence
of
mind
and
the
imminent
peril
of
the
lady
alicia
mr
beveridge
recounted
an
equally
vivid
story
of
a
runaway
horse
recovered
by
himself
to
its
fair
owner
s
unbounded
gratitude
official
opinion
naturally
accepted
the
official
account
and
for
the
next
few
days
mr
beveridge
became
an
object
of
considerable
anxiety
and
mistrust
i
can
t
make
the
man
out
said
sherlaw
to
escott
i
had
begun
to
think
there
was
nothing
much
the
matter
with
no
more
there
is
replied
escott
his
memory
seems
to
me
to
have
suffered
from
something
and
he
simply
supplies
its
place
in
conversation
from
his
imagination
and
in
action
from
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
the
methods
of
society
are
too
orthodox
for
such
an
aberration
and
as
his
friends
doubtless
pay
a
handsome
fee
to
keep
him
here
old
congers
labels
him
mad
and
locks
the
door
on
a
day
or
two
afterwards
official
opinion
was
a
little
disturbed
lady
alicia
in
reply
to
anxious
inquiries
gave
a
third
version
of
the
adventure
from
which
nothing
in
particular
could
be
gathered
except
that
nothing
in
particular
had
happened
what
do
you
make
of
this
escott
asked
dr
congleton
laying
her
note
before
his
assistant
merely
that
a
woman
wrote
hum
i
suppose
that
the
upon
which
the
doctor
looked
profound
and
went
to
lunch
chapter
vi
two
notes
and
seven
and
sixpence
in
silver
said
mr
beveridge
to
himself
ah
and
a
on
the
card
was
written
from
a
friend
if
you
will
accept
it
he
was
standing
under
the
wall
in
the
secluded
walk
holding
a
little
lady
s
purse
in
his
hand
and
listening
to
two
different
footsteps
one
little
pair
of
feet
were
hurrying
away
on
the
farther
side
of
the
high
wall
another
and
larger
were
approaching
him
at
a
run
wot
s
he
bin
up
to
now
i
wonder
moggridge
panted
to
the
second
pair
of
feet
belonged
to
him
shamming
and
sending
me
in
for
an
andkerchief
and
then
sneaking
off
here
by
isself
what
a
time
you
ve
been
said
mr
beveridge
slipping
the
purse
with
its
contents
into
his
pocket
i
was
so
infernally
cold
i
had
to
take
a
little
walk
got
the
handkerchief
in
silence
and
with
a
suspicious
solemnity
moggridge
handed
him
the
handkerchief
and
they
turned
back
for
the
house
now
for
a
balloon
mr
beveridge
reflected
certainly
it
was
cold
the
frost
nipped
sharp
that
night
and
next
morning
there
were
ice
gardens
on
the
windows
and
the
park
lay
white
all
through
the
winter
sunshine
by
evening
the
private
lake
was
reported
to
be
bearing
and
the
next
day
it
hummed
under
the
first
skaters
hardly
necessary
to
say
mr
beveridge
was
among
the
earliest
of
them
or
that
he
was
at
once
the
object
of
general
admiration
and
envy
he
traced
vines
and
q
s
and
performed
wonderful
feats
on
one
leg
all
morning
at
lunch
he
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
was
off
again
at
once
to
the
ice
when
he
reached
the
lake
in
the
afternoon
the
first
person
he
spied
was
lady
alicia
and
five
minutes
afterwards
they
were
sailing
off
together
hand
in
hand
i
knew
you
would
come
he
remarked
how
you
have
known
it
was
by
the
merest
chance
i
happened
to
it
has
always
been
by
the
merest
chance
that
any
of
them
have
ever
who
have
ever
come
she
inquired
with
a
vague
feeling
that
he
had
said
something
he
ought
not
to
have
and
that
she
was
doing
the
same
many
things
he
smiled
including
purses
which
reminds
me
that
i
am
eternally
your
she
blushed
and
said
i
hope
you
didn
t
not
much
he
answered
candidly
in
my
present
circumstances
a
note
is
more
acceptable
than
a
the
lady
alicia
again
remembered
the
maidenly
proprieties
and
tried
to
change
the
subject
what
beautiful
ice
she
said
the
question
now
is
he
continued
paying
no
heed
to
this
diversion
what
am
i
to
do
next
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
a
little
faintly
realising
dimly
that
she
was
being
regarded
as
a
in
some
unlawful
project
the
wall
is
high
there
is
on
the
top
and
i
shall
find
it
hard
to
bring
away
a
fresh
pair
of
trousers
and
probably
draughty
if
i
don
t
the
gates
are
always
kept
closed
and
it
isn
t
worth
any
one
s
while
to
open
them
for
less
the
price
of
a
ticket
up
to
town
what
are
we
to
do
we
she
gasped
you
and
i
he
explained
i
can
t
do
can
t
possibly
is
a
phrase
i
have
learned
to
really
mr
beveridge
i
mustn
t
do
mustn
t
is
an
invariable
preface
to
a
sin
never
use
it
it
s
a
temptation
in
it
wouldn
t
be
right
she
said
with
quite
a
show
of
firmness
he
looked
at
her
a
little
curiously
for
a
moment
he
almost
seemed
puzzled
then
he
pressed
her
hand
and
asked
tenderly
why
not
and
in
a
aside
he
added
that
s
the
correct
move
i
what
did
you
say
she
asked
i
said
why
not
he
answered
with
increasing
tenderness
but
you
said
something
i
added
a
brief
prayer
for
lady
alicia
sighed
and
repeated
a
little
less
firmly
it
wouldn
t
be
right
of
me
mr
but
what
would
be
wrong
this
was
said
with
even
more
fervour
my
are
very
particular
you
who
are
we
papa
is
strict
high
an
idea
seemed
to
strike
mr
beveridge
for
he
ruminated
in
silence
i
asked
mr
curate
you
know
lady
alicia
continued
with
a
heroic
effort
to
make
her
position
clear
you
told
him
he
exclaimed
oh
i
didn
t
say
who
it
mean
what
it
was
i
thought
of
mean
the
is
the
possibility
and
he
said
it
was
very
kind
of
me
to
think
of
it
but
i
mustn
t
do
anything
and
he
advised
me
to
read
a
book
he
gave
me
i
mustn
t
think
of
it
really
mr
to
himself
mr
beveridge
repeated
under
his
breath
archbishops
bishops
deacons
curates
fast
in
lent
and
an
anthem
after
the
creed
i
think
i
remember
enough
to
then
he
assumed
a
very
serious
face
and
said
aloud
your
scruples
do
your
heart
credit
they
have
given
me
an
insight
into
your
deep
and
sweet
character
which
emboldens
me
to
make
a
he
stopped
skating
folded
his
arms
and
continued
unblushingly
i
was
educated
for
the
church
but
the
prejudices
of
my
parents
the
immature
scepticism
of
youth
and
some
uncertainty
about
obtaining
my
archbishopric
induced
me
in
an
unfortunate
moment
which
i
never
ceased
to
bitterly
regret
to
quit
my
you
are
in
orders
she
exclaimed
i
was
in
several
i
cancelled
them
and
entered
the
navy

she
asked
excusably
bewildered
by
these
rapid
changes
of
occupation
for
five
years
i
was
never
but
she
but
you
said
you
were
in

mr
beveridge
gave
her
a
look
full
of
benignant
compassion
that
made
her
she
did
not
quite
know
why
feel
terribly
abashed
my
regiment
was
quartered
at
sea
he
condescended
to
explain
but
in
time
my
conscience
awoke
i
announced
my
intention
of
resuming
my
charge
my
uncle
was
furious
my
enemies
were
many

were
both
silent
she
ventured
once
to
glance
up
at
his
face
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
eyes
were
perhaps
it
was
that
her
own
were
a
little
dim
let
us
skate
on
he
said
abruptly
with
a
fine
air
of
resignation
by
the
way
he
suddenly
added
i
was
extremely
high
church
in
fact
almost
freezingly
for
five
minutes
they
skated
in
silence
then
lady
alicia
began
softly
supposing
went
what
is
the
use
of
talking
of
it
he
exclaimed
melodramatically
let
me
forget
my
hopes
you
a
friend
she
said
slowly
a
friend
who
tantalises
me
by
supposings
but
supposing
you
did
mr
beveridge
would
you
go
back
to
you
say
you
had
a
parish
i
had
a
large
populous
and
happy
parish
it
is
my
one
dream
to
sit
once
more
on
its
council
and
direct
my
of
course
that
makes
a
difference
mr
candles
didn
t
know
all
they
had
come
by
this
time
to
the
corner
of
a
little
island
that
lay
not
far
from
the
shore
in
the
channel
ahead
a
board
labelled
danger
marked
a
hidden
spring
behind
them
the
shining
ice
was
almost
bare
of
skaters
for
all
but
dr
escott
seemed
to
be
leaving
on
the
bank
they
could
see
moggridge
prowling
about
in
the
gathering
dusk
a
vigilant
reminder
of
captivity
mr
beveridge
took
the
whole
scene
in
with
it
is
to
be
feared
a
militant
rather
than
an
episcopal
eye
then
he
suddenly
asked
are
you
alone
you
drive
back
he
took
out
his
watch
and
made
a
brief
calculation
go
now
call
at
clankwood
or
do
anything
else
you
like
and
pass
down
the
drive
again
at
a
quarter
to
this
sudden
pinning
of
her
irresolution
almost
took
lady
alicia
s
breath
away
but
i
never
she
began
my
dear
friend
he
interrupted
in
the
hour
of
action
only
a
fool
ever
says
come
and
while
she
still
hesitated
they
were
off
again
she
tried
to
expostulate
my
dearest
friend
he
whispered
and
my
dear
old
vicarage
he
gave
her
no
time
to
protest
her
skates
were
off
she
was
on
her
way
to
her
carriage
and
he
was
striking
out
again
for
the
middle
of
the
lake
before
she
had
time
to
collect
her
wits
he
took
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
the
time
it
was
nearly
a
four
then
he
came
up
to
escott
who
by
this
time
was
the
only
other
soul
on
the
ice
about
time
we
were
going
in
said
escott
give
me
more
i
ll
show
you
how
to
do
that
vine
you
all
right
assented
the
doctor
a
minute
or
two
later
mr
beveridge
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
reflection
exclaimed
by
jove
there
s
that
poor
devil
moggridge
freezing
to
death
on
shore
can
t
you
manage
to
look
after
so
dangerous
a
lunatic
yourself
it
is
his
hallo
so
he
is
replied
escott
i
ll
send
him
and
so
there
were
only
left
the
two
men
on
the
ice
for
a
little
the
lesson
went
on
and
presently
leaving
the
doctor
to
practise
mr
beveridge
skated
away
by
himself
he
first
paused
opposite
a
seat
on
the
bank
over
which
hung
dr
escott
s
great
fur
coat
this
spectacle
appeared
to
afford
him
peculiar
pleasure
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
four
he
shut
the
watch
with
a
click
threw
a
glance
at
his
pupil
and
struck
out
for
the
island
if
the
doctor
had
been
looking
he
might
have
seen
him
round
it
in
the
gloaming
dr
escott
leaning
far
on
his
outside
edge
met
him
as
he
returned
what
s
that
under
your
coat
he
asked
a
picture
i
intend
to
ask
your
opinion
on
presently
replied
mr
beveridge
and
he
added
with
his
most
charming
air
but
now
before
we
go
in
let
me
give
you
a
ride
on
one
of
these
chairs
they
started
off
the
pace
growing
faster
and
faster
and
presently
dr
escott
saw
that
they
were
going
behind
the
island
look
out
for
the
spring
he
cried
it
must
be
bearing
now
replied
mr
beveridge
striking
out
harder
than
ever
they
have
taken
away
the
all
right
said
the
doctor
on
you
as
he
spoke
he
felt
a
violent
push
and
the
chair
slewing
round
as
it
went
flew
on
its
course
unguided
mr
beveridge
s
skates
rasped
on
the
ice
with
a
spray
of
white
powder
as
he
stopped
himself
suddenly
ahead
of
him
there
was
a
rending
crack
and
dr
escott
and
his
chair
disappeared
mr
beveridge
laughed
cheerfully
and
taking
from
under
his
coat
a
board
with
the
legend
danger
printed
in
large
characters
across
its
face
he
placed
it
beside
the
jagged
hole
here
is
the
picture
doctor
he
said
as
a
dripping
gasping
head
came
up
for
the
second
time
i
must
ask
a
thousand
pardons
for
i
say
liberty
but
as
you
know
i
m
off
my
head
good
night
let
me
recommend
a
hot
drink
when
you
come
out
there
are
only
five
feet
of
water
so
you
won
t
and
with
that
he
skated
rapidly
away
escott
had
a
glimpse
of
him
vanishing
round
the
corner
of
the
island
and
then
the
ice
broke
again
and
down
he
went
four
five
six
times
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
get
out
and
every
time
the
thin
ice
tore
under
his
hands
and
he
slipped
back
again
by
the
seventh
attempt
he
had
broken
his
way
to
the
thicker
sheet
he
got
one
leg
up
slipped
got
it
up
again
and
at
last
half
numbed
and
wholly
breathless
he
was
crawling
circumspectly
away
when
at
last
he
ventured
to
rise
to
his
feet
he
skated
with
all
the
speed
he
could
make
to
the
seat
where
he
had
left
his
coat
a
pair
of
skates
lay
there
instead
but
the
coat
had
vanished
dr
escott
s
philosophical
estimate
of
mr
beveridge
became
considerably
modified
thank
the
lord
he
can
t
get
out
of
the
grounds
he
said
to
himself
what
a
dangerous
devil
he
is
but
he
ll
be
sorry
for
this
performance
or
i
m
when
he
arrived
at
the
house
his
first
inquiries
were
for
his
tutor
in
the
art
of
and
he
was
rather
surprised
to
hear
that
he
had
not
yet
returned
for
he
only
imagined
himself
the
victim
of
a
peculiarly
practical
joke
men
with
lanterns
were
sent
out
to
search
the
park
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
mr
beveridge
inquiries
were
made
at
the
lodge
but
the
gatekeeper
could
swear
that
only
a
single
carriage
had
passed
through
dr
congleton
refused
at
first
to
believe
that
he
could
possibly
have
got
out
our
arrangements
are
perfect
thing
s
absurd
he
said
peremptorily
that
there
man
sir
replied
moggridge
who
had
been
summoned
is
the
slipperiest
customer
as
ever
i
seed
e
s
hout
sir
i
we
might
at
least
try
the
stations
suggested
escott
who
had
by
this
time
changed
and
indulged
in
the
hot
drink
recommended
the
doctor
began
to
be
a
little
shaken
well
well
said
he
i
ll
send
a
man
to
each
of
the
three
stations
within
walking
distance
and
whether
he
s
out
or
in
we
ll
have
him
by
morning
i
ve
always
taken
care
that
he
had
no
money
in
his
but
what
is
a
doctor
s
care
against
a
woman
s
heart
for
many
clankwood
had
to
lament
the
loss
of
the
gifted
francis
beveridge
chapter
vii
at
sixteen
minutes
to
five
mr
beveridge
stood
by
the
side
of
the
clankwood
avenue
comfortably
wrapped
in
dr
escort
s
fur
coat
and
smoking
with
the
greatest
relish
one
of
dr
escott
s
undeniable
cigars
it
was
almost
dark
the
air
bit
keen
the
dim
park
with
its
population
of
black
trees
was
filled
with
a
frosty
eager
stillness
all
round
the
invisible
wall
hemmed
him
in
the
ten
pounds
seventeen
shillings
and
sixpence
lay
useless
in
his
pocket
till
that
was
past
and
his
one
hope
depended
on
a
woman
but
mr
beveridge
was
an
amateur
in
the
sex
and
he
smiled
complacently
as
he
smoked
he
had
waited
barely
three
minutes
when
the
quick
clatter
of
a
pair
of
horses
fell
on
his
ears
and
presently
the
lights
of
a
carriage
and
pair
driving
swiftly
away
from
clankwood
raked
the
drive
on
either
side
as
they
rattled
up
to
him
he
gave
a
shout
to
the
coachman
to
stop
and
stepped
right
in
front
of
the
horses
with
something
that
sounded
unlike
a
blessing
the
pair
were
thrown
almost
on
their
haunches
to
check
them
in
time
never
stopping
to
explain
he
threw
open
the
door
and
sprang
in
the
coachman
hearing
no
sound
of
protest
whipped
up
again
and
mr
beveridge
found
himself
rolling
through
the
park
of
clankwood
in
the
countess
of
grillyer
s
carriage
with
a
very
timid
little
figure
by
his
side
even
in
that
moment
of
triumphant
excitement
the
excellence
of
his
manners
was
remarkable
the
first
thing
he
said
was
do
you
mind
smoking
in
her
confusion
of
mind
lady
alicia
could
only
reply
oh
no
and
not
till
some
time
afterwards
did
she
remember
that
the
odour
of
a
cigar
was
clinging
and
the
countess
s
nose
unusually
sensitive
after
this
first
remark
he
leaned
back
in
silence
gradually
filling
the
carriage
with
a
cloud
and
looking
out
of
the
windows
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
they
passed
quickly
through
the
lines
of
trees
and
the
open
spaces
of
frosty
they
drew
up
at
the
lodge
for
a
moment
he
heard
his
prison
gates
swing
open
the
harness
jingled
and
the
hoofs
began
to
clatter
again
a
swift
vision
of
lighted
windows
and
a
man
looking
on
them
incuriously
swept
by
and
then
they
were
rolling
over
a
country
road
between
hedgerows
and
under
the
free
stars
it
was
the
lady
alicia
who
spoke
first
i
never
thought
you
would
really
come
she
said
i
have
been
waiting
for
that
remark
he
replied
with
his
most
irresistible
smile
now
for
some
more
practical
as
he
did
not
immediately
begin
this
conversation
himself
her
curiosity
overcame
her
and
she
asked
how
did
you
manage
to
get
out
as
my
friend
dr
escott
offered
no
opposition
i
walked
did
he
really
let
you
he
never
even
it
s
all
right
she
said
with
an
inexplicable
sensation
of
disappointment
t
they
object
not
yet
he
replied
objections
to
my
movements
are
generally
made
after
they
have
been
somehow
she
felt
immensely
relieved
at
this
hint
of
opposition
i
m
so
glad
you
got
away
she
whispered
and
then
repented
in
a
flutter
not
more
so
than
i
am
he
answered
pressing
her
hand
and
now
he
added
i
should
like
to
know
how
near
ashditch
junction
you
propose
to
take
where
are
you
going
to
mr
beveridge
the
mr
beveridge
was
thrown
in
as
a
corrective
to
the
to
london
where
else
my
alicia
with
in
my
pocket
i
shall
be
able
to
eat
at
least
three
good
dinners
and
by
the
third
of
them
if
i
haven
t
fallen
on
my
feet
it
will
be
the
first
time
i
have
descended
so
but
she
asked
considerably
disconcerted
i
thought
you
were
going
back
to
your
for
a
moment
he
too
seemed
a
trifle
put
about
then
he
replied
readily
so
i
am
as
soon
as
i
have
purchased
the
necessary
outfit
restocked
my
ecclesiastical
library
and
called
on
my
she
felt
greatly
relieved
at
this
justification
of
her
share
in
the
adventure
drop
me
at
the
nearest
point
to
the
station
he
said
i
am
afraid
she
i
mean
i
think
you
had
better
get
out
soon
the
first
road
on
the
right
will
take
you
straight
there
and
we
had
better
not
pass
then
i
must
bid
you
farewell
and
he
sighed
most
effectively
farewell
my
benefactress
my
dear
alicia
shall
i
ever
see
you
shall
i
ever
hear
of
you
again
i
might
just
write
once
if
you
will
answer
it
i
mean
if
you
would
care
to
hear
from
such
she
found
it
difficult
to
finish
and
prudently
stopped
thanks
he
replied
cheerfully
do
shall
live
in
hopes
i
d
better
stop
the
carriage
he
let
down
the
window
when
she
said
hastily
but
i
don
t
know
your
he
reflected
for
an
instant
care
of
the
archbishop
of
york
will
always
find
me
he
replied
and
as
if
unwilling
to
let
his
emotion
be
observed
he
immediately
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
called
on
the
coachman
to
stop
he
whispered
tenderly
squeezing
her
fingers
with
one
hand
and
opening
the
door
with
the
other
don
t
quite
forget
me
she
whispered
back
never
he
replied
and
was
in
the
act
of
getting
out
when
he
suddenly
turned
and
exclaimed
i
must
be
more
out
of
practice
than
i
thought
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
protested
and
without
further
preamble
the
lady
alicia
found
herself
kissed
at
last
he
jumped
out
and
shut
the
door
and
the
carriage
with
its
faint
halo
clattered
into
the
darkness
they
are
wonderfully
alike
he
reflected
about
twenty
minutes
later
he
walked
leisurely
into
ashditch
junction
and
having
singled
out
the
he
accosted
him
with
an
air
of
beneficient
consideration
and
inquired
how
soon
he
could
catch
a
train
for
london
it
appeared
that
the
up
express
was
not
due
for
nearly
of
an
hour
a
little
too
long
to
wait
he
said
to
himself
as
he
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
purloined
fur
coat
to
keep
out
the
cold
and
picked
another
cigar
from
its
rightful
owner
s
case
by
way
of
further
defying
the
temperature
and
cementing
his
acquaintance
with
the
he
offered
to
regale
that
gratified
official
with
such
refreshments
as
the
station
bar
provided
in
the
consumption
of
a
beverage
difficult
to
obtain
in
any
quantity
at
clankwood
mr
beveridge
showed
himself
as
accomplished
as
in
every
other
feat
in
minutes
he
had
despatched
no
fewer
than
six
besides
completely
winning
the
s
heart
as
he
had
little
more
than
five
minutes
now
to
wait
he
bade
a
genial
farewell
to
the
lady
behind
the
bar
and
started
to
purchase
his
ticket
hardly
had
he
left
the
door
of
the
when
he
perceived
an
uncomfortably
familiar
figure
just
arrived
breathless
with
running
on
the
opposite
platform
the
light
of
a
lamp
fell
on
his
shining
face
it
was
moggridge
a
stout
heart
might
be
forgiven
for
sinking
at
the
sight
but
mr
beveridge
merely
turned
to
his
now
firm
friends
and
said
with
his
easiest
air
on
the
opposite
platform
i
perceive
one
of
my
runaway
lunatics
bring
a
couple
of
stout
porters
as
quickly
as
you
can
for
he
is
a
person
of
much
strength
and
address
my
name
he
drew
a
from
the
pocket
of
his
fur
coat
is
as
you
see
dr
escott
of
meanwhile
moggridge
after
hurriedly
investigating
the
platform
he
was
on
suddenly
spied
a
tall
figure
on
the
opposite
side
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
he
sprang
on
to
the
rails
and
had
just
mounted
the
other
side
as
the
and
two
porters
appeared
seeing
his
allies
by
his
side
mr
beveridge
never
said
a
word
but
throwing
off
his
hat
he
lowered
his
head
charged
his
keeper
and
picking
him
up
by
the
knees
threw
him
heavily
on
his
back
before
he
had
a
chance
of
recovering
himself
the
other
three
were
seated
on
his
chest
employed
in
winding
a
coil
of
rope
round
and
round
his
prostrate
form
two
minutes
later
moggridge
was
sitting
bound
hand
and
foot
in
the
booking
office
addressing
an
amused
audience
in
a
strain
of
perhaps
excusable
exasperation
which
however
merely
served
to
impress
the
ashditch
officials
with
a
growing
sense
of
their
address
in
capturing
so
dangerous
a
lunatic
in
the
middle
of
this
entertaining
scene
the
london
express
steamed
in
and
mr
beveridge
courteously
thanking
the
for
his
assistance
stepped
into
a
carriage
i
should
be
much
obliged
he
said
leaning
on
the
door
of
his
compartment
and
blowing
the
smoke
of
dr
escott
s
last
havannah
lightly
from
his
lips
if
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
keep
that
poor
fellow
in
the
station
till
it
is
rather
too
late
to
send
him
back
now
good
night
and
many
he
pressed
a
coin
into
the
s
hand
which
that
disappointed
official
only
discovered
on
emptying
his
pockets
at
night
to
be
an
ordinary
sixpence
the
guard
whistled
and
one
by
one
smoothly
and
slowly
and
then
in
a
bright
stream
the
station
lamps
slipped
by
the
last
of
them
flitted
into
the
night
and
the
train
swung
and
rattled
by
a
mile
a
minute
nearer
to
london
town
and
farther
from
the
high
stone
wall
there
was
no
other
stop
and
for
a
long
hour
the
adventurer
sat
with
his
legs
luxuriously
stretched
along
the
cushions
looking
out
into
a
fainter
duplicate
of
his
carriage
pierced
now
and
then
by
the
glitter
of
brighter
points
as
they
whisked
by
some
wayside
village
or
crossed
by
the
black
shadows
of
trees
the
whole
time
he
smiled
contentedly
doubtless
at
the
prospect
of
his
parish
work
all
at
once
he
seemed
stirred
and
turning
in
his
seat
laid
his
face
upon
the
window
and
pulled
down
the
blind
behind
his
head
so
that
he
could
see
into
the
night
he
had
spied
the
first
bright
filaments
of
london
quickly
they
spread
into
a
twinkling
network
and
then
as
quickly
were
shut
out
by
the
first
line
of
suburb
houses
through
the
gaps
they
grew
nearer
and
flared
cheerfully
the
train
hooted
over
an
archway
and
in
the
road
below
he
had
a
glimpse
of
shop
windows
and
crowded
pavements
and
moving
omnibuses
he
was
in
the
world
again
and
at
the
foretaste
of
all
this
life
he
laughed
like
a
delighted
child
last
of
all
came
the
spread
of
shining
rails
and
the
red
and
yellow
lights
of
many
signals
and
then
the
high
glass
roof
and
long
platforms
of
st
euston
s
cross
unencumbered
by
luggage
or
plans
mr
francis
beveridge
stuck
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
strolled
aimlessly
enough
out
of
the
station
into
the
tideway
of
the
euston
road
for
a
little
he
stood
on
the
pavement
watching
the
throng
of
people
and
the
perpetual
buses
and
drays
and
the
jingling
hansoms
picking
their
way
through
it
all
for
a
man
of
brains
he
moralised
even
though
he
be
certified
as
insane
for
probably
the
best
of
reasons
this
london
has
surely
fools
enough
to
provide
him
with
all
he
needs
and
more
than
he
deserves
i
shall
set
out
with
my
lantern
like
a
second
diogenes
to
look
for
a
foolish
and
so
he
strolled
along
again
to
the
first
opening
southwards
that
led
him
through
a
region
of
dingy
enough
brick
by
day
but
decked
now
with
its
string
of
lamps
and
bright
here
and
there
and
kept
alive
by
passing
buses
and
cabs
going
and
coming
from
the
station
farther
on
the
street
grew
gloomier
and
a
dark
square
with
a
grove
of
trees
in
the
middle
opened
off
one
side
but
rattle
or
quiet
flaring
shops
or
lodgings
he
found
it
all
too
fresh
and
amusing
to
hurry
back
to
my
parish
again
he
said
to
himself
smiling
broadly
at
the
drollery
of
the
idea
if
i
m
caught
i
ll
at
least
have
one
merry
night
in
my
wicked
humorous
old
he
reached
holborn
and
turned
west
in
the
happiest
and
most
enviable
of
moods
the
very
policemen
seemed
to
cast
a
friendly
eye
on
him
the
frosty
air
he
thought
made
the
lights
burn
brighter
and
the
crowd
move
more
briskly
than
ever
he
had
seen
them
suddenly
the
sight
of
a
hairdresser
s
saloon
brought
an
inspiration
he
stroked
his
beard
twisted
his
moustaches
half
regretfully
and
then
exclaiming
exit
mr
beveridge
turned
into
the
shop
part
ii
chapter
i
the
baron
rudolf
von
blitzenberg
sat
by
himself
at
a
table
in
the
of
the
hôtel
mayonaise
which
as
everybody
knows
is
the
largest
and
most
expensive
in
london
he
was
a
young
man
of
a
florid
and
burly
teutonic
type
and
the
most
ingenuous
countenance
being
possessed
of
a
curious
and
enterprising
disposition
as
well
as
the
most
ample
means
he
had
left
his
ancestral
castle
in
bavaria
to
study
for
a
few
months
the
customs
and
politics
of
england
in
the
language
he
was
already
proficient
and
he
had
promised
himself
an
amusing
as
well
as
an
instructive
visit
but
although
he
had
only
arrived
in
london
that
morning
he
was
already
beginning
to
feel
an
uncomfortable
apprehension
lest
in
both
respects
he
should
be
disappointed
though
his
introductions
were
the
best
with
which
the
british
ambassador
could
supply
him
they
were
only
three
or
four
in
number
not
wishing
to
be
hampered
with
too
many
acquaintances
he
had
rather
chosen
quality
than
quantity
and
now
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
he
had
found
to
his
chagrin
that
in
every
case
the
families
were
out
of
town
in
fact
so
far
as
he
could
learn
they
were
not
even
at
their
own
country
seats
one
was
abroad
another
gone
to
the
seaside
to
recover
from
the
mumps
or
a
third
paying
a
round
of
visits
the
disappointment
was
sharp
he
felt
utterly
at
sea
as
to
what
he
should
do
and
he
was
already
beginning
to
experience
the
loneliness
of
a
single
mortal
in
a
crowded
hotel
as
the
frosty
evening
was
setting
in
and
the
shops
were
being
lit
he
had
strolled
out
into
the
streets
in
the
vague
hope
of
meeting
some
strange
foreign
adventure
or
perhaps
even
happily
lighting
upon
some
diplomatic
acquaintance
but
he
found
the
pavements
crowded
with
a
throng
who
took
no
notice
of
him
at
all
but
seemed
every
man
and
most
women
of
them
to
be
pushing
steadily
and
generally
silently
towards
a
million
mysterious
goals
not
that
he
could
tell
they
were
silent
except
by
their
set
lips
for
the
noise
of
wheels
and
horses
on
so
many
hundreds
of
miles
of
streets
and
the
cries
of
busmen
and
vendors
of
evening
papers
made
such
a
hubbub
that
he
felt
before
long
in
a
maze
he
lost
his
way
four
times
and
was
patronisingly
set
right
by
beneficent
policemen
and
at
last
feeling
like
a
man
who
has
fallen
off
a
precipice
on
to
a
soft
the
worse
but
quite
struggled
back
to
his
hotel
there
he
spun
out
his
time
by
watching
the
people
come
and
go
and
at
last
dressed
with
extra
deliberation
about
eight
o
clock
he
sat
down
to
his
solitary
dinner
the
great
gilt
and
panelled
room
was
full
of
diners
and
bustling
waiters
but
there
was
not
a
face
the
baron
had
ever
seen
before
he
was
just
finishing
a
plate
of
whitebait
when
he
observed
a
stranger
enter
the
room
and
stroll
in
a
very
manner
down
the
middle
glancing
at
the
tables
round
him
as
though
he
was
looking
either
for
a
friend
or
a
desirable
seat
this
gentleman
was
tall
fair
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
tweeds
and
his
air
impressed
the
baron
as
being
natural
and
yet
distinguished
at
last
his
eye
fell
upon
the
baron
who
felt
conscious
of
undergoing
a
quick
critical
scrutiny
the
table
at
which
that
nobleman
sat
was
laid
for
two
and
coming
apparently
to
a
sudden
resolution
the
stranger
seated
himself
in
the
vacant
chair
in
an
agreeable
voice
and
with
an
unmistakably
air
he
asked
a
waiter
for
the
and
then
like
a
man
with
an
excellent
appetite
fell
to
upon
the
various
d
the
entire
collection
of
which
in
fact
he
consumed
in
a
wonderfully
short
space
of
time
the
baron
being
himself
no
trifler
with
his
victuals
regarded
this
feat
with
sympathetic
approval
and
began
to
feel
a
little
less
alone
in
the
world
his
naturally
open
disposition
was
warmed
besides
owing
to
a
slight
misconception
he
had
fallen
into
perfectly
excusable
however
in
a
foreigner
he
thought
he
had
read
somewhere
that
port
was
the
usual
accompaniment
to
the
first
courses
of
an
english
dinner
and
as
his
waiter
had
been
somewhat
dilatory
in
bringing
him
the
more
substantial
items
of
the
repast
he
had
already
drunk
three
of
this
cheering
wine
the
chill
recollections
of
his
sixteen
quarterings
and
the
exclusiveness
he
had
determined
to
maintain
as
becoming
to
his
rank
were
already
melting
and
he
met
the
stranger
s
eye
with
what
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
help
being
a
cordial
look
his
caught
the
glance
smiled
back
and
immediately
asked
with
the
most
charming
politeness
do
you
care
sir
to
split
a
bottle
of
champagne
said
the
baron
with
a
disappointed
consciousness
of
having
been
put
at
a
loss
in
his
english
by
the
very
first
man
who
had
spoken
to
him
i
beg
your
pardon
am
afraid
i
was
unintelligibly
idiomatic
to
divide
i
should
say
you
consuming
i
the
other
am
i
clear
sir
for
a
moment
the
baron
was
a
little
taken
aback
and
then
recollecting
that
the
dining
habits
of
the
english
were
still
new
to
him
he
concluded
that
the
suggestion
was
probably
a
customary
act
of
courtesy
he
had
already
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
gentleman
must
be
a
person
of
rank
and
he
replied
affably
is
vid
pleasure
zanks
the
pleasure
is
mine
said
the
and
half
the
bottle
he
added
smiling
the
baron
whose
perception
of
humour
had
been
abnormally
increased
by
this
time
laughed
hilariously
at
the
infection
of
his
new
acquaintance
s
smile
goot
goot
he
cried
ach
yah

i
right
sir
in
supposing
that
despite
the
perfection
of
your
english
accent
i
can
not
be
fortunate
enough
to
claim
you
as
a
countryman
asked
the
stranger
the
baron
s
resolutions
of
reticence
had
vanished
altogether
before
such
unexpected
and
he
could
not
but
think
friendliness
he
unburdened
his
heart
with
a
rush
you

a
cork
popped
and
the
champagne
frothed
into
the
stranger
s
glass
raising
it
to
his
lips
he
said

the

enthusiastically

it

when

readily
in

if

roared
the
baron
thinking
he
had
discovered
a
jest
ha
ha
ha
goot
zehr
goot
the
other
looked
a
trifle
astonished
for
an
instant
and
then
as
he
sipped
his
champagne
an
expression
of
intense
satisfaction
came
over
his
face
i
can
put
away
my
lantern
he
said
to
himself
i
have
found
may
i
have
the
boldness
to
ask
your
name
sir
he
asked
aloud
ze
baron
rudolph
von
blitzenberg
that
nobleman
replied
yours
i
dare
francis
bunker
at
your
service
you
are
noble
queried
the
baron
a
little
anxiously
for
his
prejudices
on
this
point
were
strong
according
to
your
standard
i
believe
i
may
say
so
that
s
to
say
my
family
have
borne
arms
for
two
hundred
odd
generations
per
cent
of
them
have
died
of
good
living
and
the
most
malicious
have
never
accused
us
of
brains
i
myself
may
not
be
very
typical
but
i
assure
you
it
isn
t
my
ancestors
the
latter
part
of
this
explanation
entirely
puzzled
the
baron
the
first
statement
though
eminently
satisfactory
was
also
a
little
bewildering
two
hondred
generations
he
asked
courteously
zat
is
a
vary
old
family
all
bore
arms
you
say
mistair
bonker
all
replied
mr
bunker
gravely
the
first
few
bore
tails
as
ha
ha
ha
laughed
the
baron
you
are
a
fonny
man
i
pairceive
vat
you
call
clown
yes
what
my
friends
call
clown
and
i
call
wit
mr
bunker
corrected
vit
ha
ha
ha
roared
the
baron
whose
mind
was
now
in
an
el
dorado
of
humour
when
jokes
grew
like
daisies
his
loneliness
had
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
as
course
succeeded
course
his
contentment
showed
itself
in
a
perpetually
beaming
smile
he
ceased
to
worry
even
about
his
friend
s
pedigree
convinced
in
his
mind
that
manners
so
delightful
and
distinguished
could
only
result
from
repeated
quarterings
and
unoccupied
forefathers
yet
by
the
time
dessert
arrived
and
he
had
again
returned
to
his
port
he
began
to
feel
an
extreme
curiosity
to
know
more
concerning
mr
bunker
he
himself
had
volunteered
a
large
quantity
of
miscellaneous
information
about
bavaria
its
customs
and
its
people
more
especially
the
habits
and
history
of
the
blitzenberg
family
about
himself
his
parentage
and
education
all
about
his
family
ghost
his
official
position
as
hereditary
to
the
bavarian
court
and
many
other
things
equally
entertaining
and
instructive
mr
bunker
for
his
part
had
so
far
confined
his
confidences
to
his
name
my
dear
bonker
said
the
baron
at
had
become
quite
familiar
by
this
vat
make
you
in
london
i
fear
you
are
bird
of
passage
do
you
stay
long
mr
bunker
cracked
a
nut
looking
very
serious
then
he
leant
on
one
elbow
glanced
up
at
the
ceiling
pensively
and
sighed
i
hope
i
do
not
ask
vat
i
should
not
the
baron
interposed
courteously
my
dear
baron
ask
what
you
like
replied
mr
bunker
in
a
city
full
of
strangers
or
of
friends
who
have
forgotten
me
you
alone
have
my
confidence
my
story
is
a
common
one
of
youthful
folly
and
present
repentance
but
such
as
it
is
you
are
welcome
to
the
baron
gulped
down
half
a
glass
of
port
and
leaned
forward
sympathetically
my
father
mr
bunker
continued
with
an
air
of
reminiscence
is
one
of
the
largest
landowners
and
the
head
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
families
in
the
north
of
england
i
was
his
eldest
son
and
heir
i
am
still
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
his
eldest
son
but
my
heirship
i
regret
to
say
is
more
doubtful
i
spent
a
prodigal
youth
and
a
larger
sum
of
money
than
my
poor
father
approved
of
he
was
a
strict
though
a
kind
parent
and
for
the
good
of
my
health
and
the
replenishment
of
the
family
coffers
which
had
been
sadly
drained
by
my
extravagance
he
sent
me
abroad
there
i
have
led
a
roving
life
for
the
last
six
years
and
at
last
my
wild
oats
sown
reaped
and
gathered
in
and
a
stackyard
they
made
i
can
assure
you
i
decided
to
return
to
england
and
become
an
ornament
to
respectable
society
like
you
i
arrived
in
london
but
only
to
find
to
my
disgust
that
my
family
have
gone
to
winter
in
egypt
so
you
see
that
at
present
i
am
like
a
shipwrecked
sailor
clinging
to
a
rock
and
waiting
with
what
patience
i
can
muster
for
a
boat
to
take
me
you
mean
inquired
the
baron
anxiously
that
you
vish
to
go
to
egypt
at
vonce
i
had
thought
of
it
though
there
is
a
difficulty
in
the
way
i
you
vill
not
stay
zen
here
my
dear
baron
why
should
i
i
have
neither
friends

mr

with
an
air
of
reluctant
candour
my
funds

rather
low
i
had
trusted
to
finding
my
father
at
home
but
as
he
isn
t
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
the
baron
seemed
struck
with
an
idea
which
he
hesitated
to
express
shall

smoke

friend

the

twenty
square
miles
of
strangers

when

upon

congenial
spirit

of

my
dear

said
mr
bunker
like
a
man
persuaded
against
his
will
what
can
i
say
i
confess
i
might
find
a
little
difficulty
in
replenishing
my
purse
without
resorting
to
disagreeable
means
and
if
you
really
wish

they
pledged
each
other
cordially
and
talked
from
that
moment
like
old
friends
the
baron
was
thoroughly
pleased
with
himself
and
mr
bunker
seemed
no
less
gratified
at
his
own
good
fortune
half
an
hour
went
quickly
by
and
then
the
baron
exclaimed
let
us
do
zomzing

burn
for
to
begin
zis
show
of
what
would
you
care
to

continued
the
baron
solemnly
i
must
not

and
yet
replied
his
friend
persuasively
even
wickedness
needs
a
bot
if
i
begin
i
may
not
stop
zomzing
more
qviet

first
night
haf
you
a
club
mr
bunker
pondered
for
a
moment
and
a
curious
smile
stole
across
his
face
then
it
vanished
and
he
answered
readily
certainly
baron
an
excellent
idea
i
haven
t
been
to
my
club
for
so
long
that
it
never
struck
me
let
us
goot
cried
the
baron
rising
with
alacrity
they
put
on
their
coats
mr
bunker
s
it
may
be
remarked
being
a
handsome
garment
the
porter
hailed
a
cab
and
the
driver
was
ordered
to
take
them
to
the
regent
s
club
in
pall
mall
the
baron
knew
it
by
reputation
as
the
most
exclusive
in
london
and
his
opinion
of
his
friend
rose
still
higher
they
joined
a
jingling
string
of
other
hansoms
and
sped
swiftly
through
the
exhilarating
bustle
of
the
streets
to
the
baron
it
seemed
as
if
a
great
change
had
come
over
the
city
since
he
wandered
disconsolately
before
dinner
carried
swiftly
to
the
music
of
the
little
bells
through
the
sharp
air
and
the
london
night
that
is
brighter
than
day
with
a
friend
by
his
side
and
a
good
dinner
within
he
marked
the
most
astonishing
difference
all
the
people
seemed
to
talk
and
laugh
and
for
his
own
part
he
found
it
hard
to
keep
his
tongue
still
i
know
ze
name
of
ze
regent
s
he
said
vun
club
of
ze
best
is
it
not
the
very
best
club
zey
are
all
noble
in
many
cases
the
receipts
for
their
escutcheons
are
still
in
their
though
the
precise
significance
of
this
explanation
was
not
quite
clear
to
the
baron
it
sounded
eminently
satisfactory
zo
he
said
i
shall
be
moch
interested
to
see
as
they
entered
the
club
the
porter
stared
at
them
curiously
and
even
made
a
movement
as
though
he
would
step
out
and
address
them
but
mr
bunker
wishing
him
a
courteous
good
evening
walked
briskly
up
to
the
racks
in
the
hall
a
young
man
had
just
hung
up
his
hat
and
as
he
was
divesting
himself
of
his
coat
mr
bunker
quickly
took
the
hat
down
glanced
at
the
name
inside
and
replaced
it
on
its
peg
then
he
held
out
his
hand
and
addressed
the
young
man
cordially
good
evening
transome
how
are
you
said
he
and
heedless
of
the
look
of
surprise
on
the
other
s
face
he
turned
towards
the
baron
and
added
let
me
introduce
the
baron
rudolph
von
transome
the
baron
has
just
come
to
england
and
i
thought
he
couldn
t
begin
better
than
by
a
visit
to
the
regent
s
let
us
come
into
the
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
all
on
the
best
of
terms
a
certain
perplexity
and
almost
shyness
that
the
young
man
showed
at
first
vanished
rapidly
before
the
baron
s
cordiality
and
mr
bunker
s
charm
of
manner
they
were
deeply
engrossed
in
a
discussion
on
the
reigning
sovereign
of
the
baron
s
native
land
a
monarch
of
whose
enlightened
policy
that
nobleman
spoke
with
pardonable
pride
when
two
elderly
gentlemen
entered
the
room
who
are
these
mr
bunker
whispered
to
transome
i
know
them
very
well
but
i
am
always
bad
at
lord
fabrigas
and
general
m
dermott
replied
transome
instantly
mr
bunker
rose
and
greeted
the
good
evening
lord
fabrigas
good
evening
general
you
have
just
come
in
time
to
be
introduced
to
the
baron
rudolph
von
blitzenberg
whom
you
doubtless
know
by
the
baron
rose
and
bowed
and
it
struck
him
that
elderly
english
gentlemen
were
singularly
stiff
and
constrained
in
their
manner
mr
bunker
however
continued
cheerfully
we
are
just
going
to
have
a
smoking
concert
will
you
begin
baron
i
know
not
english
songs
replied
the
baron
bot
i
should
like
moch
to
you
must
join
in
the
chorus
certainly
bonker
i
haf
a
voice
zat
is
you
yes
ze
mr
bunker
cleared
his
throat
and
just
as
the
general
was
on
the
point
of
interposing
a
remark
struck
up
hastily
and
for
the
first
time
in
its
long
and
honourable
history
the
of
the
regent
s
club
reechoed
to
a
popular
ditty
they
sometimes
call
em
duckies
they
sometimes
call
em
pets
and
sometimes
they
refer
to
em
as
dears
they
live
on
little
matters
that
a
gentleman
forgets
in
a
little
world
of
giggles
and
of
tears
there
are
different
varieties
from
which
a
man
may
choose
there
are
sorts
and
shapes
and
sizes
without
end
but
the
kind
i
d
pick
myself
is
the
kind
you
introduce
by
the
simple
title
of
my
lady
chorus
baron
and
then
he
trolled
in
waltz
time
this
edifying
my
lady
friend
my
lady
friend
can
t
you
twig
dear
boys
from
the
sound
of
the
kisses
she
isn
t
my
misses
she
s
only
my
lady
friend
in
a
voice
like
a
train
going
over
a
bridge
the
baron
chimed
my
laty
vrient
my
laty
vrient
can
not

i
am
afraid
said
mr
bunker
as
they
finished
the
chorus
that
i
can
t
remember
any
more
now
general
it
s
your
sir
replied
that
gallant
officer
who
had
listened
to
this
ditty
in
purple
and
petrified
astonishment
i
don
t
know
who
the
devil
you
are
but
i
can
tell
you
you
won
t
remain
a
member
of
this
club
much
longer
if
you
come
into
it
again
in
this
i
had
forgotten
said
mr
bunker
with
even
more
than
his
usual
politeness
that
such
an
admirable
critic
was
listening
to
me
i
must
apologise
for
my
poor
wishing
him
courteously
he
took
the
baron
by
the
arm
and
walked
out
while
that
somewhat
perplexed
nobleman
was
struggling
into
his
coat
his
friend
rapidly
and
dexterously
converted
all
the
silk
hats
he
could
see
into
the
condition
of
collapsed
opera
hats
and
then
picked
a
small
off
the
floor
the
baron
walked
out
through
the
door
first
but
mr
bunker
stopped
for
an
instant
opposite
the
s
box
and
crying
good
night
to
you
sir
hurled
the
bag
through
the
glass
rushed
after
his
friend
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
they
were
tearing
up
pall
mall
in
a
hansom
for
a
few
minutes
both
were
silent
then
the
baron
said
slowly
i
do
not
qvite
my
dear
baron
his
friend
explained
gaily
these
practical
jokes
are
very
common
in
our
clubs
they
are
quite
part
of
our
national
life
you
know
and
i
thought
you
ought
to
see
the
baron
said
nothing
but
he
began
to
realise
that
he
was
indeed
in
a
foreign
country
chapter

said
the
baron
mr
bunker
sipped
his
coffee
and
smiled
back
at
his
friend
what
would
you
like
said
he
they
were
sitting
in
the
baron
s
private
room
finishing
one
of
the
renowned
hôtel
mayonaise
breakfasts
out
of
the
windows
they
could
see
the
bright
curving
river
the
bare
tops
of
the
embankment
trees
a
file
of
barges
drifting
with
the
tide
and
clouds
hurrying
over
the
chaos
of
brick
on
the
opposite
shore
it
was
a
bright
breezy
morning
and
the
baron
felt
in
high
with
his
surroundings
on
maturer
consideration
the
entertaining
experience
of
the
night
before
had
greatly
raised
mr
bunker
in
his
estimation
he
had
chuckled
his
way
through
a
substantial
breakfast
and
in
such
good
company
felt
ready
for
any
adventure
that
might
turn
up
he
lit
a
cigar
pushed
back
his
chair
and
replied
blandly
i
am
in
your
hands
i
am
ready
to
enjoy

but

of
your
philosophical
temperament
can
draw

the
baron
excellent
you

and
we
share
the
entertainment
the
theory
is
perfect
but
i
m
afraid
we
need
a
programme
now
on
my
own
first
visit
to
london
i
remember
being
the
madame
tussaud
s
waxworks
the
tower
st
paul
s
cathedral
the
fishmarket
at
billingsgate
the
british
museum
and
a
number
of
other
damnably
edifying
spectacles
you
might
naturally
suppose
that
after
such
a
round
it
would
be
quite
superfluous
for
me
ever
to
come
up
to
town
again
yet
surprising
as
it
may
appear
most
of
the
knowledge
of
london
i
hope
to
put
at
your
disposal
has
been
gained
in
the
course
of
subsequent
bot
zese

zey
not
instrogtif
if
you
wish
to
learn
that
a
great
number
of
years
ago
a
vast
quantity
of
inconsequent
events
occurred
or
that
in
an
otherwise
amusing
enough
world
there
are
here
and
there
collected
so
many
roomfuls
of
cheerless
articles
i
can
strongly
recommend
a
visit
to
the
tower
of
london
or
the

mine

said
the
baron
thoughtfully
i
can

then
my
dear
baron
while
you
are
here
forget
it
and
yet
said
the
baron
still
thoughtfully
somzing
i
should
lairn
certainly
you
will
learn
something
of
what
goes
on
underneath
a
waistcoat
and
a
little
of
the
contents
of
a
corset
and
petticoat
also
of
the
strange
customs
of
this
city
and
the
excellence
of
british
ha
ha
ha
laughed
the
baron
who
thought
that
if
his
friend
had
not
actually
made
a
jest
it
was
at
least
time
for
one
to
occur

mr

continued
reflectively
we

pretty
extensive
operation

said
his
friend
a
gentleman
should
be
dressed
in
with
now
and
then
an
apology
for
his
extravagance
he
took
full
advantage
of
the
baron
s
generosity
and
ordered
such
an
assortment
of
garments
that
his
tailor
could
hardly
bow
low
enough
to
express
his
gratification
after
an
excellent
lunch
in
the
most
expensive
restaurant
to
be
found
they
walked
westwards
along
piccadilly
mr
bunker
pointing
out
the
various
objects
of
historical
or
ephemeral
interest
to
be
seen
in
that
thoroughfare
the
baron
drinking
in
this
information
with
the
serious
air
of
the
distinguished
traveller
and
now
we
come
to
the
park
said
mr
bunker
guard

with
the
moral
always
running
through
it
i
shall
not
the
sunshine
had
brought
out
a
great
many
carriages
and
a
sprinkling
of
walkers
along
the
railings
the
two
friends
strolled
among
them
eyeing
the
women
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
look
back
at
a
carriage
i
suppose
said
the
baron
zat
vile
you
haf
been
avay
your
frients
have
forgot
as
he
spoke
a
young
man
looked
hard
at
mr
bunker
and
even
made
a
movement
as
though
he
would
stop
and
speak
to
him
mr
bunker
looked
blandly
through
him
and
walked
on
do
you
not
know
zat
gentleman
which
gentleman
ze
young
man
zat
looked
so
at
some
young
men
have
a
way
of
staring
here
a
few
minutes
later
a
lady
in
a
passing
carriage
looked
round
sharply
at
them
with
an
air
of
great
surprise
and
half
bowed
surely
exclaimed
the
baron
zat
vas
a
frient
of
yours
i
am
not
a
friend
of
hers
then
mr
bunker
replied
with
a
laugh
her
bow
i
think
must
have
been
aimed
at
the
baron
shook
his
head
and
seemed
to
be
drawing
a
moral
baron
his
friend
exclaimed
suddenly
let
us
go
back
here
comes
one
of
our
most
popular
phenomena
a
london
fog
we
need
not
stay
in
the
park
to
observe
the
sun
was
already
obscured
there
stole
a
most
insidious
chill
through
the
air
like
the
changing
of
a
scene
on
the
stage
they
found
themselves
in
a
few
minutes
walking
in
a
little
ring
of
trees
and
road
and
iron
railings
instead
of
a
wide
sunny
park
the
roar
of
the
streets
came
from
behind
a
wall
of
mist
that
opened
mysteriously
to
let
a
phantom
carriage
in
and
out
and
closed
silently
behind
it
again
i
like
not
zis
said
the
baron
with
a
shiver
by
the
time
they
had
found
piccadilly
again
there
was
nothing
at
all
to
be
seen
but
the
light
of
the
nearest
lamp
as
large
and
far
away
as
a
struggling
sun
and
the
shadowy
people
who
flitted
by
their
talk
ceased
the
baron
turned
up
his
collar
and
sucked
his
cigar
lugubriously
and
mr
bunker
seemed
unusually
thoughtful
they
had
walked
nearly
as
far
as
piccadilly
circus
when
they
were
pulled
up
by
a
cab
turning
down
a
there
was
a
at
the
corner
and
under
it
stood
a
burly
man
his
red
face
quite
visible
as
they
came
up
to
his
shoulder
in
an
instant
mr
bunker
seized
the
baron
by
the
arm
pulled
him
round
and
began
to
walk
hastily
back
again
vat
for
zis
said
the
baron
in
great
astonishment
we
have
come
too
far
thanks
to
this
infernal
fog
we
must
cross
the
street
and
take
the
first
turning
on
the
other
side
i
must
apologise
baron
for
my
absence
of
the
cab
passed
by
and
the
man
strolled
on
like
lookin
for
a
needle
in
a
bloomin
haystack
he
said
to
himself
i
might
as
well
go
back
to
clankwood
e
s
a
good
riddance
i
chapter
iv
the
baron
and
mr
bunker
discussed
their
dinner
with
the
relish
of
approving
connoisseurs
mr
bunker
commended
the
hock
and
suggested
a
second
bottle
the
baron
praised
the
and
insisted
on
another
helping
the
frequent
laughter
arising
from
their
table
excited
general
remark
throughout
the
room
and
already
the
waiters
were
whispering
to
the
other
guests
that
this
was
a
german
nobleman
of
royal
blood
engaged
in
a
diplomatic
mission
of
importance
and
his
friend
a
ducal
member
of
the
english
cabinet
at
present
for
reasons
of
state
incognito
bonker
exclaimed
the
baron

his

a

mit
a

a
strange
city
man

well
i
ll
do
my
best
for
you
but
i
confess
the
provision
of
romantic
adventures
is
a
little
outside
the
programme
we
ve
ha

bonker
they
arrived
at
the
corinthian
theatre
about
the
middle
of
the
first
act
for
as
mr
bunker
explained
it
is
always
well
to
produce
a
good
first
impression
and
few
more
effective
means
can
be
devised
than
working
one
s
way
to
the
middle
of
a
line
of
stalls
with
the
play
already
in
progress
hardly
were
they
seated
when
the
baron
drove
his
elbow
into
his
friend
s
ribs
draped
for
the
night
it
may
be
remarked
with
one
of
the
baron
s
spare
and
exclaimed
in
an
excited
whisper
next
to
you
bonker
ach
zehr
hüpsch
even
before
this
hint
mr
bunker
had
observed
that
the
lady
on
the
other
side
of
him
was
possessed
of
exceptional
attractions
for
a
little
time
he
studied
her
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
he
noticed
that
the
stall
on
the
farther
side
of
her
was
empty
that
she
once
or
twice
looked
round
as
though
she
expected
somebody
and
that
she
seemed
not
altogether
unconscious
of
her
new
neighbours
he
further
observed
that
her
face
was
of
a
type
that
is
more
usually
engaged
in
attack
than
defence
then
he
whispered
would
you
like
to
know
her
ach
yah
replied
the
baron
eagerly
you
mr
bunker
smiled
confidently
a
few
minutes
later
he
happened
to
let
his
programme
fall
into
her
lap
i
beg
your
pardon
he
whispered
softly
and
glanced
into
her
eyes
with
a
smile
ready
his
usual
discernment
had
not
failed
him
she
smiled
and
instantly
he
produced
his
a
little
later
her
happened
to
slip
from
her
hand
and
though
they
only
slipped
slowly
it
was
no
doubt
owing
to
his
ready
presence
of
mind
that
their
fall
was
averted
this
time
their
fingers
happened
to
touch
and
they
smiled
without
an
apology
he
leant
towards
her
looking
however
at
the
play
they
shared
a
laugh
over
a
joke
that
she
might
have
been
excused
for
not
understanding
presently
a
criticism
of
some
situation
escaped
him
inadvertently
and
she
smiled
again
soon
after
she
gave
an
exclamation
and
he
answered
sympathetically
and
at
the
end
of
the
act
the
curtain
came
down
on
an
acquaintance
already
begun
as
the
lights
were
turned
up
and
here
and
there
men
began
to
go
out
she
again
looked
at
the
entrances
in
some
apparent
concern
either
lest
some
one
should
not
come
in
or
lest
some
one
should
he
is
late
said
mr
bunker
smiling
she
gave
a
very
enticing
look
of
surprise
and
consented
to
smile
back
before
she
coyly
looked
away
again
an
erring
husband
i
she
admitted
that
it
was
in
fact
a
husband
who
had
failed
her
but
she
added
i
m
mean
i
expect
he
ll
come
in
after
the
next
act
it
s
so
tiresome
of
him
to
disappoint
me
like
mr
bunker
expressed
the
deepest
sympathy
with
her
unfortunate
predicament
he
has
his
ticket
of
course
but
it
seemed
that
she
had
both
the
tickets
with
her
an
arrangement
which
he
immediately
denounced
as
likely
to
lead
to
difficulties
when
her
husband
arrived
he
further
in
the
most
obliging
manner
suggested
that
he
should
take
the
ticket
for
the
other
seat
to
the
booking
office
and
leave
instructions
for
its
being
given
to
the
gentleman
on
his
arrival
the
lady
gave
him
a
curious
little
glance
that
seemed
to
imply
a
mixture
of
doubt
as
to
his
motives
with
confidence
in
his
abilities
and
then
with
many
thanks
agreed
to
his
suggestion
mr
bunker
took
the
ticket
and
rose
at
once
that
i
may
be
sure
you
are
in
good
company
while
i
am
away
said
he
permit
me
to
introduce
my
friend
the
baron
rudolph
von
and
the
baron
promptly
took
his
vacant
seat
on
his
return
mr
bunker
found
his
friend
wreathed
in
smiles
and
engaged
in
the
most
animated
conversation
with
the
lady
and
before
the
last
act
was
over
he
gathered
from
such
scraps
of
conversation
as
reached
his
ears
that
rudolph
von
blitzenberg
had
little
to
learn
in
one
department
of
a
nobleman
s
duties
i
wonder
where
my
husband
can
be
the
lady
whispered
ach
heed
him
not
fair
lady
replied
the
baron
am
i
not
instead
of
a
hosband
i
m
afraid
you
re
a
very
naughty
man
ven
i
am
viz
you
the
gallant
baron
answered
i
forget
myself
all
bot
your
these
advances
being
made
in
the
most
dulcet
tones
of
which
the
nobleman
was
master
and
accompanied
by
the
most
enamoured
expression
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
lady
permitted
herself
to
listen
to
them
with
perhaps
too
ready
an
ear
what
mr
bunker
s
arrangement
with
the
booking
clerk
had
been
was
never
quite
clear
but
certainly
the
erring
husband
failed
to
make
his
appearance
at
all
and
at
the
last
fall
of
the
curtain
she
was
easily
persuaded
to
let
the
baron
escort
her
home
i
know
i
ought
not
but
if
a
husband
deserts
one
so
faithlessly
what
can
i
do
she
said
with
a
very
becoming
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
a
captivating
lift
of
her
eyebrows
ah
vat
indeed
he
desairves
not
so
fair
a
but
won
t
it
be
troubling
you
trouble
pleasure
and
captivation
excuse
me
baron
said
the
voice
of
mr
bunker
at
his
elbow
if
you
will
wait
here
at
the
door
i
shall
send
up
a
goot
cried
the
baron
a
zouzand
zanks
i
myself
added
mr
bunker
with
a
profound
bow
to
the
lady
shall
say
good
night
now
the
best
of
luck
baron
in
a
few
minutes
a
hansom
drove
up
and
the
baron
springing
in
beside
his
charge
told
the
man
to
drive
to
eaton
square
not
too
qvickly
he
added
in
a
stage
aside
they
reached
trafalgar
square
matters
inside
going
harmoniously
as
a
marriage
bell
in
fact
too
much
suggesting
that
simile
why
are
we
going
down
whitehall
the
lady
exclaimed
suddenly
i
know
not
replied
the
baron
placidly
ask
him
where
he
is
going
she
said
the
baron
as
in
duty
bound
asked
and
the
reassuring
reply
all
right
sir
came
back
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
i
seem
to
know
that
man
s
voice
the
lady
said
he
must
have
driven
me
to
me
all
ze
english
speak
ze
same
replied
the
baron
all
bot
you
my
fairest
viz
your
sound
like
you
call
is
it
though
his
charmer
had
serious
misgivings
regarding
their
cabman
s
topographical
knowledge
the
baron
s
company
proved
so
absorbing
that
it
was
not
till
they
were
being
rapidly
driven
over
vauxhall
bridge
that
she
at
last
took
alarm
at
first
the
baron
strove
to
soothe
her
by
the
most
approved
teutonic
blandishments
but
in
time
he
too
began
to
feel
concerned
and
in
a
voice
like
thunder
he
repeatedly
called
upon
the
driver
to
stop
no
reply
was
vouchsafed
and
the
pace
merely
grew
the
more
reckless
can
t
you
catch
the
reins
cried
the
lady
who
had
got
into
a
terrible
fright
the
baron
twice
essayed
the
feat
but
each
time
a
heavy
blow
over
the
knuckles
from
the
of
the
whip
forced
him
to
desist
the
lady
burst
into
tears
the
baron
swore
in
five
languages
alternately
and
still
the
cab
pursued
its
headlong
career
through
deserted
midnight
streets
past
infrequent
policemen
and
stray
belated
revellers
on
into
an
unknown
wilderness
of
brick
oh
don
t
let
him
murder
me
sobbed
the
lady
haf

oh

oh

wailed
the
lady
i
shall
do
it
again
they
must
have
covered
miles
and
still
the
speed
never
abated
when
suddenly
as
they
were
rounding
a
sharp
corner
the
horse
slipped
on
the
road
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
baron
and
the
lady
were
sitting
on
opposite
sides
of
their
fallen
steed
and
the
cabman
was
rubbing
his
head
some
yards
in
front
teufel
exclaimed
the
baron
rising
carefully
to
his
feet
ach
mine
dearest
vun
art
thou
hurt
the
lady
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
though
trying
to
decide
and
then
she
burst
into
hysterical
laughter
ach
zo
said
the
baron
much
relieved
zen
vill
i
see
ze
that
individual
was
still
rubbing
his
head
with
a
rueful
air
and
the
baron
was
about
to
pour
forth
all
his
indignation
when
at
the
sight
of
the
driver
s
face
he
started
back
in
blank
astonishment
bonker
it
is
i
indeed
my
dear
baron
replied
that
gentleman
politely
i
must
ask
a
thousand
pardons
for
causing
you
this
trifling
inconvenience
as
to
your
friend
i
don
t
know
how
i
am
to
make
my
peace
with
vat
means
zis
gasped
the
baron
i
was
merely
endeavouring
to
provide
the
spice
of
romance
you
required
besides
giving
you
the
opportunity
of
making
the
lady
s
better
acquaintance
can
i
do
anything
more
for
you
baron
and
you
my
dear
lady
can
i
assist
you
in
any
way
both
speaking
at
once
and
with
some
heat
gave
a
decidedly
affirmative
answer
where
are
we
asked
the
lady
who
hovered
between
fright
and
indignation
mr
bunker
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
would
be
rash
to
hazard
an
opinion
he
replied
well
cried
the
lady
her
indignation
quite
overcoming
her
fright
do
you
mean
to
say
you
ve
brought
us
here
against
our
wills
and
probably
got
me
into
trouble
and
you
don
t
even
know
where
we
are
mr
bunker
looked
up
at
the
heavens
with
a
studious
air
one
to
be
able
to
tell
something
of
our
whereabouts
from
one
of
those
stars
he
replied
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
don
t
quite
know
which
in
short
madame
it
is
not
from
want
of
goodwill
but
merely
through
ignorance
that
i
can
not
direct
the
lady
turned
impatiently
to
the
baron
helped
to
get
me
into
this
mess
she
said
tartly
what
do
you
propose
to
do
my
don
t
she
interrupted
stamping
her
foot
on
the
frosty
road
and
then
inconsequently
burst
into
tears
the
baron
and
mr
bunker
looked
at
one
another
it
is
a
fine
night
for
a
walk
and
the
cab
i
m
afraid
is
smashed
beyond
hope
of
redemption
give
the
lady
your
arm
baron
we
must
eventually
arrive
there
was
really
nothing
else
for
it
so
leaving
the
horse
and
cab
to
be
recovered
by
the
first
policeman
who
chanced
to
pass
they
set
out
on
foot
at
last
after
half
an
hour
s
ramble
through
the
solitudes
of
south
london
a
belated
cab
was
hailed
and
all
three
got
inside
once
on
her
way
home
the
lady
s
indignation
again
gave
way
to
fright
what
i
to
do
what
i
to
do
she
wailed
oh
whatever
will
my
husband
say
in
his
most
confident
and
irresistible
manner
mr
bunker
told
her
he
would
make
matters
all
right
for
her
at
whatever
cost
to
himself
and
so
infectious
was
his
assurance
that
when
at
last
they
reached
eaton
square
she
allowed
him
to
come
up
to
the
door
of
number
the
baron
prudently
remained
in
the
cab
for
as
he
explained
my
english
he
is
after
a
prolonged
knocking
and
ringing
the
door
at
length
opened
and
an
gentleman
appeared
arrayed
in
a
louisa
he
cried
what
the
on
earth
have
you
been
the
police
are
looking
for
you
all
over
london
and
may
i
venture
to
ask
who
this
is
with
you
mr
bunker
bowed
slightly
and
raised
his
hat
my
dear
sir
he
said
we
found
this
lady
in
a
lamentable
state
of
intoxication
in
the
tottenham
court
road
and
as
i
understand
you
have
a
kind
of
reversionary
interest
in
her
we
have
brought
her
here
as
for
you
sir
your
appearance
is
so
unprepossessing
that
i
am
unable
to
remain
any
longer
good
night
and
raising
his
hat
again
he
entered
the
cab
and
drove
off
assuring
the
baron
that
matters
were
satisfactorily
arranged
so
you
have
had
your
adventure
baron
he
added
with
a
smile
for
a
minute
or
two
the
baron
was
silent
then
he
broke
into
a
cheerful
guffaw
ha
ha
ha
you
are
a
fonny
devil
bonker
ach
bot
it
vas
pleasant
vile
it
lasted
chapter
a
few
days
passed
in
the
most
entertaining
manner
a
menu
of
amusements
was
regularly
prepared
suitable
to
a
catholic
taste
and
at
every
turn
the
baron
was
struck
by
the
enterprise
and
originality
of
his
friend
he
had
however
a
national
bent
for
serious
inquiry
and
now
and
then
doubts
crossed
his
mind
whether
with
all
his
moral
drawing
he
was
acquiring
quite
as
much
solid
information
as
he
had
set
out
to
gain
this
idea
grew
upon
him
till
one
morning
after
gazing
for
some
time
at
the
english
newspaper
he
always
made
a
point
of
reading
he
suddenly
exclaimed
bonker
i
haf
a
doubt
i
have
many
replied
mr
bunker
in
fact
i
have
few
positive
ideas
bot
mine
is
a
particulair
doubt
do
i
lairn
enoff
my
own
conception
of
enough
learning
baron
is
a
thing
like
a
smallest
coin
one
can
do
one
s
marketing
and
yet
said
the
baron
solemnly
for
my
own
share
i
am
not
satisfied
i
vould
lairn
more
of
ze
british
institutions
so
far
i
haf
lairned
of
ze
pleasures
my
dear
baron
they
are
the
british
the
baron
shook
his
head
and
fell
to
his
paper
again
while
mr
bunker
stretched
himself
on
the
sofa
and
gazed
through
his
at
the
ceiling
suddenly
the
baron
gave
an
exclamation
of
horror
my
dear
baron
what
is
the
matter
yet
anozer
outrage
cried
the
baron
zese
anarchists
zey
are
too
scandalous
at
all
ze
stations
zere
are
detectives
and
all
ze
ships
are
being
vatched
ach
it
is
terrible
mr
bunker
seemed
struck
with
an
idea
for
he
stared
at
the
ceiling
without
making
any
reply
and
his
eyes
had
the
baron
seen
them
twinkled
curiously
at
last
the
baron
laid

then

entertain
as
they
drove
down
he
was
in
his
wittiest
humour
and
the
baron
in
spite
of
his
desire
for
instruction

more
charmed
with
his
friend
than

asked
as
they
walked
into
the
station
i

no

humourist
my
dear
baron
shall
endeavour
to
edify
they
had
arrived
at
a
busy
hour
when
the
platforms
were
crowded
with
passengers
and
luggage
a
train
had
just
come
in
and
around
it
the
bustle
was
at
its
height
and
the
confusion
most
bewildering
wait
for
me
here
said
mr
bunker
i
shall
be
back
in
a
he
started
in
the
direction
of
the
and
then
doubling
back
through
the
crowd
walked
down
the
platform
and
stopped
opposite
a
an
old
gentleman
beside
himself
with
irritation
was
struggling
with
the
aid
of
a
porter
to
collect
his
luggage
and
presently
he
left
the
pile
he
had
got
together
and
made
a
rush
in
the
direction
of
a
large
portmanteau
that
was
just
being
tumbled
out
instantly
mr
bunker
picked
up
a
handbag
from
the
heap
and
walked
quickly
off
with
it
here
you
are
baron
he
said
as
he
came
up
to
his
friend
i
find
there
is
something
else
i
must
do
so
do
you
mind
holding
this
bag
for
a
few
minutes
if
you
will
walk
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
here
i
ll
find
you
more
easily
is
it
troubling
you
too
much
not
vun
bit
bonker
i
am
in
your
he
put
the
bag
into
the
baron
s
hand
with
his
pleasantest
smile
and
turned
away
rounding
a
corner
he
came
cautiously
back
again
through
the
crowd
and
stepped
up
to
a
policeman
keep
your
eye
on
that
man
officer
he
said
in
a
low
confidential
voice
and
an
air
of
quiet
authority
and
put
your
plain
clothes
men
on
his
track
i
know
him
for
one
of
the
most
dangerous
the
man
started
and
stared
hard
at
the
baron
and
presently
that
unconscious
nobleman
pacing
the
platform
in
growing
wonder
at
mr
bunker
s
lengthy
absence
and
looking
anxiously
round
him
on
all
sides
noticed
with
surprise
that
a
number
of
quietly
dressed
men
with
no
apparent
business
in
the
station
were
eyeing
him
with
it
seemed
to
him
an
interest
that
approached
suspicion
in
time
he
grew
annoyed
he
returned
their
glances
with
his
haughtiest
and
most
indignant
look
and
finally
stepping
up
to
one
of
them
asked
in
no
friendly
voice
vat
for
do
you
vatch
me
the
man
returned
an
evasive
answer
and
passing
one
of
his
whispered
foreign
i
was
sure
of
at
last
the
baron
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
laying
the
bag
down
by
the
door
of
the
turned
hastily
away
on
the
instant
mr
bunker
who
had
watched
these
proceedings
from
a
safe
distance
cried
in
a
loud
and
agonised
voice
down
with
your
men
sergeant
down
lie
down
it
will
explode
in
twenty
seconds
and
as
he
spoke
he
threw
himself
flat
on
his
face
so
infectious
were
his
commanding
voice
and
his
note
of
alarm
that
one
after
another
detectives
passengers
and
porters
cast
themselves
at
full
length
on
the
platform
the
baron
filled
with
terror
of
anarchist
plots
was
one
of
the
first
to
prostrate
himself
and
at
that
there
could
be
no
further
doubt
of
the
imminence
of
the
peril
the
cabs
rattled
and
voices
sounded
from
outside
an
engine
whistled
and
shunted
at
a
far
platform
but
never
before
at
that
hour
of
the
day
had
liverpool
street
station
been
so
silent
all
held
their
breath
and
heard
their
hearts
thump
as
they
gazed
in
horrible
fascination
at
that
fatal
bag
or
with
closed
eyes
stumbled
through
a
hasty
prayer
fully
a
minute
passed
and
the
suspense
was
growing
intolerable
when
with
a
loud
oath
an
old
gentleman
rose
to
his
feet
and
walked
briskly
up
to
the
bag
have
a
care
sir
for
heaven
s
sake
have
a
care
cried
mr
bunker
but
the
old
gentleman
merely
bent
over
the
terrible
object
and
picking
it
up
exclaimed
in
bewildered
wrath
it
s
my
bag
who
the
devil
brought
it
here
and
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
nonsense
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
roared
mr
bunker
while
like
sheepish
mushrooms
the
people
sprang
up
on
all
sides
my
dear
sir
said
mr
bunker
coming
up
to
the
old
gentleman
and
raising
his
hat
with
his
most
affable
air
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
on
recovering
your
lost
property
and
allow
me
further
to
introduce
my
friend
the
baron
rudolph
von
baron
von
cried
the
old
gentleman
did
you
take
my
bag
sir
and
if
so
are
you
a
thief
or
a
lunatic
for
an
instant
even
mr
bunker
himself
seemed
a
trifle
taken
aback
then
he
replied
politely
i
am
not
a
thief
then
what
you
been
doing
demanded
the
sergeant
merely
demonstrating
to
my
friend
the
baron
the
extraordinary
vigilance
of
the
english
for
a
time
neither
the
old
gentleman
nor
the
sergeant
seemed
quite
capable
of
taking
the
same
view
of
the
episode
as
mr
bunker
and
curiously
enough
the
baron
seemed
not
disinclined
to
let
his
friend
extricate
himself
as
best
he
could
no
one
however
could
resist
mr
bunker
and
before
very
long
he
and
the
baron
were
driving
up
bishopsgate
street
together
with
the
old
gentleman
s
lumbering
in
front
of
them
well
baron
are
you
satisfied
with
your
morning
s
instruction
asked
his
friend
a
german
nobleman
is
not
used
to
be
in
soch
a
position
replied
the
baron
stiffly
you
must
admit
however
that
the
in
the
detection
of
anarchy
was
neatly
i
admit
nozing
of
ze
kind
said
the
baron
stolidly
for
the
rest
of
the
drive
he
sat
obdurately
silent
he
went
to
his
room
with
the
mien
of
an
offended
man
during
lunch
he
only
opened
his
lips
to
eat
on
his
side
mr
bunker
maintained
a
cheerful
composure
and
seemed
not
a
whit
put
about
by
his
friend
s
lack
of
appreciation
anozzer
bottle
of
claret
said
the
baron
gruffly
to
a
waiter
mr
bunker
let
him
consume
it
entirely
by
himself
awaiting
the
results
with
patience
gradually
his
face
relaxed
a
little
until
all
at
once
when
the
bump
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
was
beginning
to
appear
above
the
wine
the
whole
room
was
startled
by
a
stentorian
ha

the
baron
expressed
no

wish

but
instead
he
began
to
show
a
desire
for
society

one

an
idea
seemed
to
seize
mr
bunker
let
me
see
the
paper
he
said
after
perusing
it
carefully
for
a
little
he
at
last
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
pleased
discovery
hullo
i
see
that
lady
tulliwuddle

giving
a
reception

of

glad
to
see
me
can
you
take
me
of
course
my
dear
baron
she
will
be
goot
cried
the
baron
ve
shall
mr
bunker
explained
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
arrive
very
late
and
so
it
was
not
until
after
twelve
o
clock
that
they
left
the
hôtel
mayonaise
for
the
regions
of
belgravia
the
baron
primed
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
arrayed
in
a
costume
which
mr
bunker
had
assured
him
was
the
very
latest
extreme
of
fashion
and
which
included
a
scarlet
watered
silk
waistcoat
a
pair
of
white
silk
socks
and
a
lavender
tie
was
in
a
condition
of
cheerfulness
verging
closely
on
hilarity
mr
bunker
that
as
he
said
he
might
better
serve
as
a
foil
to
his
friend
s
splendour
went
more
inconspicuously
dressed
but
was
likewise
well
charged
with
champagne
he
too
was
in
his
happiest
vein
and
the
vision
of
the
baron
s
finery
appeared
to
afford
him
peculiar
gratification
their
hansom
stopped
in
front
of
a
large
and
gaily
mansion
with
an
awning
leading
to
the
door
and
a
cluster
of
carriages
and
footmen
by
the
kerbstone
they
entered
and
having
divested
themselves
of
their
coats
mr
bunker
proposed
that
they
should
immediately
seek
the
bot
should
i
not
be
first
introduced
to
mine
hostess
asked
the
baron
my
dear
baron
a
formal
reception
of
the
guests
is
entirely
foreign
to
english
zo
i
did
not
know
the
was
crowded
and
having
secured
a
table
with
some
difficulty
mr
bunker
entered
immediately
into
conversation
with
a
solitary
young
gentleman
who
was
consuming
a
plate
of
oysters
before
they
had
exchanged
six
sentences
the
young
man
had
entirely
succumbed
to
mr
bunker
s
address
aided
possibly
by
the
young
man
s
supper
permit
me
to
introduce
my
friend
the
baron
rudolph
von
blitzenberg
a
nobleman
strange
as
yet
to
england
but
renowned
throughout
his
native
land
alike
for
his
talents
and
his
lofty
position
said
mr
bunker
ach
my
good
friend
exclaimed
the
baron
grasping
the
young
man
s
hand
das
ist
bonker
s
vat
you
call
nonsense
bot
i
am
delighted
zehr
delighted
to
meet
you
and
if
you
gom
to
bavaria
you
most
shoot
vid
me
bravo
ha
from
which
it
may
be
gathered
that
the
baron
was
in
a
genial
humour
who
is
that
girl
asked
mr
bunker
pointing
to
an
extremely
pretty
damsel
just
leaving
the
room
oh
that
s
my
cousin
lady
muriel
hilton
she
s
thought
rather
pretty
i
believe
answered
the
young
man
do
you
mind
introducing
me
certainly
said
their
new
friend
come
as
they
were
passing
through
the
room
a
little
incident
occurred
that
if
the
baron
s
perceptions
had
been
keener
might
have
given
him
cause
for
some
speculation
two
men
standing
by
the
door
looked
hard
at
mr
bunker
and
then
at
each
other
and
as
the
baron
passed
them
he
heard
one
say
it
looks
devilish
like
he
has
shaved
then
said
the
other
evidently
replied
the
first
speaker
but
i
thought
he
was
unlikely
to
appear
in
any
society
for
some
they
both
laughed
and
the
baron
heard
no
more
when
they
reached
the
ballroom
the
band
was
striking
up
a
polka
and
presently
mr
bunker
with
his
accustomed
grace
was
tearing
round
the
room
with
lady
muriel
while
the
delight
of
all
eyes
in
his
red
out
her
sister
in
a
very
short
time
the
other
dancers
found
the
baron
and
his
friend
s
onslaught
so
vigorous
that
prudence
compelled
them
to
take
shelter
along
the
wall
and
from
a
safe
distance
admire
the
evolutions
of
these
two
mysterious
guests
mr
bunker
was
enlivening
the
monotony
of
the
polka
by
the
judicious
introduction
of
hornpipe
steps
while
the
baron
his
high
above
his
head
shouted
and
stamped
in
his
wild
career
do
stop
for
a
minute
baron
gasped
his
fair
partner
himmel
nein
roared
the
baron
i
haf
gom
here
for
to
dance
ha
bonker
ha
at
last
lady
muriel
had
to
stop
through
sheer
exhaustion
but
mr
bunker
merely
letting
her
go
pursued
his
solitary
way
and
kicking
unimpeded
the
baron
stopped
breathless
to
admire
him
round
and
round
he
went
the
only
figure
in
the
middle
of
the
room
his
arms
akimbo
his
feet
and
kicking
to
the
music
while
high
above
the
band
resounded
his
friend
s
shouts
of
bravo
bonker
wunderschön
gott
in
himmel
higher
higher
till
at
length
missing
the
wall
in
an
attempt
to
find
support
the
baron
dropped
with
a
thud
into
a
sitting
posture
and
continued
his
demonstrations
from
the
floor
meanwhile
their
alarmed
hostess
was
holding
a
hasty
consultation
with
her
husband
and
when
the
music
at
last
stopped
and
mr
bunker
was
advancing
with
his
most
courteous
air
towards
his
late
partner
lord
tulliwuddle
stepped
up
to
him
and
touched
his
arm
may
i
speak
to
you
sir
he
said
certainly
replied
mr
bunker
i
shall
be
honoured
excuse
me
for
one
moment
lady
at
whose
invitation

demanded
his
host
sternly
i
have
the
pleasure
of
addressing
lord
tulliwuddle
have
i
not
you
have
mr
bunker
bent
towards
him
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
from
scotland
yard
exclaimed
his
lordship
hush
said
mr
bunker
glancing
cautiously
round
the
room
and
then
he
added
with
an
air
of
impressive
gravity
you

a
bathroom
on
the
third
floor
i
believe

have
replied
his
host
in
great
surprise

will
favour
me
by
coming

a
minute
my
lord

avoid
a
serious
private
scandal
say
nothing
about
it
at
present
to
any
in
blank
astonishment
and
some
alarm
lord
tulliwuddle
went
up
with
him
to
the
third
floor
where
the
house
was
still
and
the
sounds
of
revelry
reached
faintly
what
does
this
mean
sir
he
asked
if
i
am
right
in
my
conjectures
you
will
need
no
explanation
from
me
my
his
lordship
opened
a
door
and
turning
on
an
electric
light
revealed
a
small
and
bathroom
ha
no
said
mr
bunker
what
are

with
the
key
exclaimed
his
host
good
night
my
lord

shall
tell
them
to
send
up
breakfast
at
nine
said
mr
bunker
and
stepping
quickly
out
he
shut
and
locked
the
door
a
minute
later
he
was
back
in
the
ballroom
looking
anxiously
for
the
baron
but
that
nobleman
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
devil
he
said
to
himself
can
they
have
tackled
him
too
but
as
he
ran
downstairs
a
gust
of
cheerful
laughter
set
his
mind
at
ease

infectious
hilarity
they
all
looked
up
with
great
curiosity
at
mr

that
gentleman

cried
waving
his
hand
to
the
room
generally
ven
you
gom

bavaria
you
most
all
shoot
vid
me
bravo
my
goot
bonker
ha
ha
as
they
turned
away
from
the
table
one
of
the
young
men
who
had
been
looking
very
hard
at
mr
bunker
rose
and
touched
his
sleeve
i
say
aren
t
he
began
possibly
i
am
interrupted
mr
bunker
only
i
haven
t
the
slightest
recollection
of
the
an
astonished
lady
was
indicated
by
mr
bunker
as
the
hostess
and
to
her
the
baron
bade
an
affectionate
adieu
he
handed
a
sovereign
to
the
footman
embraced
the
butler
and
as
they
sped
eastwards
in
their
hansom
a
rousing
chorus
from
the
two
friends
awoke
the
echoes
of
piccadilly
bravo
bonker
himmel
i
haf
enjoyed
myself
sighed
the
exhausted
baron
chapter
vii
the
baron
and
mr
bunker
discussed
a
twelve
o
clock
breakfast
with
the
relish
of
men
who
had
done
a
good
night
s
work
the
baron
was
full
of
his
exploits
ze
lofly
lady
hilton
and
his
new
friends
seemed
to
have
made
a
vivid
impression
zey
vill
be
in
ze
park
of
course
he
suggested
possibly
replied
mr
bunker
without
any
great
enthusiasm
but
after
a
dance
it
is
rather
ze
lady
hilton
did
say
she
vent
to
ze
baron
i
do
not
remember
i
did
dance
so
hard
i
was
not
perhaps
distinct
but
i
shall
go
and
as
mr
bunker
s
attempts
to
throw
cold
water
on
this
scheme
proved
quite
futile
he
made
a
graceful
virtue
of
necessity
dressed
himself
with
care
and
set
out
in
the
afternoon
for
the
park
they
had
only
walked
as
far
as
piccadilly
circus
when
in
the
crowd
at
the
corner
his
eye
fell
upon
a
familiar
figure
it
was
the
burly
man
the
devil
moggridge
again
he
muttered
for
a
moment
he
thought
they
were
going
to
pass
unobserved
then
the
man
turned
his
head
their
way
and
mr
bunker
saw
him
start
he
never
looked
over
his
shoulder
but
after
walking
a
little
farther
he
called
the
baron
s
attention
to
a
shop
window
and
they
stopped
to
look
at
it
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
moggridge
about
twenty
yards
behind
them
stopping
too
he
was
glancing
towards
them
very
doubtfully
evidently
his
mind
was
not
yet
made
up
and
at
once
mr
bunker
s
fertile
brain
began
to
revolve
plans
a
little
farther
on
they
paused
before
another
window
and
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
then
mr
bunker
made
up
his
mind
he
looked
carefully
at
the
cabs
and
at
last
observed
a
young
man
driving
a
fresh
likely
horse
at
a
walking
pace
beside
the
pavement
he
caught
the
driver
s
eye
and
raised
his
stick
and
turning
suddenly
to
the
baron
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance
exclaimed
forgive
my
rudeness
baron
i
m
afraid
i
must
leave
you
i
had
clean
forgotten
an
important
engagement
in
the
city
for
this
appointment
in
ze
city
said
the
baron
in
considerable
surprise
i
did
not
know
you
had
friends
in
ze
i
have
just
heard
from
my
father
s
man
of
business
and
i
m
afraid
it
would
be
impolitic
not
to
see
him
do
you
mind
if
i
leave
you
here
surely
my
dear
fellow
i
vould
not
stop
you
already
i
feel
at
home
by
then
we
shall
meet
at
the
hotel
before
dinner
good
luck
with
the
ladies
mr
bunker
jumped
into
the
cab
saying
only
to
the
driver
to
the
city
as
quick
as
you
what
part
sir
oh
say
the
bank
hurry
up
then
as
the
man
whipped
up
mr
bunker
had
a
glimpse
of
moggridge
hailing
another
cab
and
peeping
cautiously
through
the
little
window
at
the
back
he
saw
him
starting
in
hot
pursuit
he
took
five
shillings
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
the
in
the
roof
do
you
see
that
other
cab
chasing
us
with
a
man
inside
yes
mr
bunker
handed
his
driver
the
money
get
rid
of
him
then
take
me
anywhere
through
the
city
you
like
and
when
he
s
off
the
scent
let
me
very
good
sir
replied
the
driver
cracking
his
whip
till
his
steed
began
to
move
past
the
buses
and
the
other
cabs
like
a
train
on
they
flew
clatter
and
jingle
twisting
like
a
snipe
through
the
traffic
mr
bunker
perceived
that
he
had
a
good
horse
and
a
good
driver
and
he
smiled
in
pleasant
excitement
he
lit
a
cigar
leaned
his
arms
on
the
doors
and
settled
himself
to
enjoy
the
race
the
black
lions
of
trafalgar
square
flew
by
then
the
colossal
hotels
of
northumberland
avenue
and
the
railway
bridge
at
charing
cross
and
they
were
going
at
a
gallop
along
the
embankment
he
got
swift
glimpses
of
other
cabs
and
the
trees
seemed
to
flit
past
like
on
a
railway
the
barges
and
lighters
on
the
river
dropped
one
by
one
behind
them
it
was
a
fair
course
for
a
race
with
never
a
check
before
blackfriar
s
bridge
as
they
turned
into
queen
victoria
street
he
opened
the
lid
and
asked
are
they
still
in
sight
yes
sir
i
m
afraid
we
ain
t
gaining
much
yet
but
i
ll
do
it
sir
no
mr
bunker
lay
back
and
laughed
this
is
better
than
the
park
he
said
to
himself
they
had
a
fine
drive
up
queen
victoria
street
before
they
plunged
into
the
whirlpool
of
traffic
at
the
bank
they
were
slowly
making
their
way
across
when
the
driver
spying
an
opening
in
another
stream
abruptly
wheeled
round
for
cornhill
and
presently
they
were
off
again
at
top
speed
thrown
them
off
asked
mr
bunker
tried
to
sir
but
they
were
too
sharp
and
got
clear
away
mr
bunker
saw
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
stern
chase
and
laughed
again
in
order
that
he
might
not
show
ostensibly
that
he
was
running
away
he
resisted
the
temptation
of
having
another
peep
through
the
back
and
resigned
himself
to
the
chances
of
the
chase
through
and
through
the
lanes
and
byways
of
the
city
they
drove
and
after
each
double
the
answer
from
the
box
was
always
the
same
the
cab
behind
could
not
be
shaken
off
work
your
way
round
to
holborn
and
try
a
run
west
mr
bunker
suggested
so
after
a
little
they
struck
newgate
street
and
presently
their
steed
stretched
himself
again
in
holborn
viaduct
gaining
now
cabby
a
little
sir
i
mr
bunker
sat
placidly
till
they
were
well
along
holborn
before
he
inquired
again
can
t
get
rid
of
im
no
ow
afride
it
ain
t
much
good
mr
bunker
passed
up
five
shillings
more
keep
your
tail
up
you
ll
do
it
yet
he
exhorted
try
a
turn
north
you
may
bother
him
among
the
so
they
doubled
north
and
as
the
evening
closed
in
their
wearied
horse
was
lashed
through
a
maze
of
monotonous
streets
and
tarnished
bloomsbury
squares
and
still
the
other
cab
stuck
to
their
trail
but
when
they
emerged
on
the
euston
road
mr
bunker
was
as
cheerful
as
ever
they
can
t
last
much
longer
he
said
to
his
driver
turn
up
regent
s
park
a
little
later
he
put
the
usual
question
and
got
the
same
unvarying
answer
the
horse
was
evidently
beginning
to
fail
and
he
saw
that
this
must
soon
come
to
an
end
the
and
the
shop
windows
were
all
lit
up
by
this
time
and
the
dusk
was
pretty
thick
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
might
venture
to
try
his
luck
on
foot
and
he
began
to
look
out
for
an
opening
where
a
cab
could
not
follow
they
were
flogging
along
a
noisy
road
where
there
was
little
other
traffic
on
one
side
stood
an
unbroken
row
of
houses
and
on
the
other
were
small
villas
with
little
strips
of
garden
about
them
all
at
once
he
saw
a
doctor
s
red
lamp
over
the
door
of
one
of
these
half
villas
and
an
inspiration
came
upon
him
one
can
always
visit
a
doctor
he
said
to
himself
and
smiled
in
great
amusement
at
something
in
the
reflection
he
stopped
the
cab
handed
the
man
half
a
sovereign
and
saying
only
drive
away
again
quickly
jumped
out
glanced
at
the
name
on
the
plate
and
pulled
the
bell
as
he
waited
on
the
step
he
saw
the
other
cab
stop
a
little
way
back
and
his
pursuer
emerge
a
frowsy
little
servant
opened
the
door
is
dr
twiddel
at
home
he
asked
dr
twiddel
s
abroad
sir
said
the
maid
no
one
in
at
all
then
dr
billson
sees
is
patients
en
there
when
do
you
expect
dr
billson
in
about
an
hour
sir
e
usually
comes
excellent
thought
mr
bunker
aloud
he
said
well
i
m
a
patient
i
ll
come
in
and
he
stepped
in
and
the
door
banged
behind
him
chapter
viii
this
w
y
sir
said
the
maid
and
mr
bunker
found
himself
in
the
little
room
where
this
story
opened
the
moment
he
was
alone
he
went
to
the
window
and
peeped
cautiously
between
the
slats
of
the
venetian
blind
the
street
was
quiet
both
cabs
had
disappeared
and
for
a
minute
or
two
he
could
see
nothing
even
of
moggridge
then
a
figure
moved
carefully
from
the
shelter
of
a
bush
a
little
way
down
the
railings
and
after
a
quick
look
at
the
house
stepped
back
again
he
means
to
play
the
waiting
game
said
mr
bunker
to
himself
long
may
you
wait
my
wary
moggridge
he
took
a
rapid
survey
of
the
room
he
saw
the
medical
library
the
rented
furniture
and
the
unlit
and
at
last
his
eye
fell
upon
a
box
of
cigarettes
to
one
of
these
he
helped
himself
and
leaned
his
back
against
the
mantelpiece
there
must
be
at
least
one
room
at
the
back
he
reflected
that
room
must
have
a
window
and
beyond
that
window
there
is
all
london
to
turn
to
friend
moggridge
i
trust
you
are
prepared
to
spend
the
evening
behind
your
he
had
another
look
through
the
blind
and
shook
his
head
a
little
too
light
yet
d
better
wait
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
to
while
away
the
time
he
proceeded
to
make
a
tour
of
the
room
for
as
he
said
to
himself
when
in
an
unknown
country
any
information
may
possibly
come
in
useful
there
was
nothing
whatever
from
which
he
could
draw
even
the
most
superficial
deduction
till
he
came
to
the
here
a
heap
of
bills
were
transfixed
by
a
long
skewer
and
at
his
first
glance
at
the
uppermost
his
face
assumed
an
expression
of
almost
ludicrous
bewilderment
he
actually
rubbed
his
eyes
before
he
looked
a
second
time
one
dozen
shirts
he
read
four
four
pair
socks
one
dozen
handkerchiefs
two
francis
beveridge
the
account
rendered
to
dr
twiddel
what
in
the
name
of
wonderment
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
sat
down
with
the
bill
in
his
hand
and
gazed
hard
at
it
precisely
my
outfit
he
said
to
himself
am
what
a
rum
thing
he
sat
for
about
ten
minutes
looking
hard
at
the
floor
then
he
burst
out
laughing
resumed
in
a
moment
his
air
of
philosophical
opportunism
and
set
about
a
further
search
of
the
desk
he
looked
at
the
bills
and
seemed
to
find
nothing
more
to
interest
him
then
he
glanced
at
one
or
two
letters
in
the
drawers
threw
the
first
few
back
again
and
at
last
paused
over
one
twiddel
to
billson
he
said
to
himself
this
may
possibly
be
worth
looking
it
was
dated
more
than
a
month
back
from
the
town
of
fogelschloss
dear
tom
it
ran
we
are
having
an
a
time
old
welsh
is
in
splendid
form
doing
the
part
to
perfection
he
has
never
given
himself
away
yet
not
even
when
drunk
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
has
been
too
often
but
then
old
welsh
is
so
funny
when
he
is
drunk
that
it
makes
him
all
the
more
like
the
original
or
at
least
what
the
original
is
supposed
to
be
of
course
we
don
t
dare
to
venture
into
places
where
we
would
see
too
many
english
this
is
quite
an
amusing
place
for
a
german
town
some
baths
and
a
kind
of
a
and
some
pretty
germans
there
is
a
sporting
aristocrat
here
in
an
old
castle
who
is
very
friendly
and
is
much
impressed
with
welsh
s
account
of
his
family
plate
and
and
has
asked
us
once
or
twice
to
come
out
and
see
him
we
are
no
end
of
swells
i
assure
you
ta
ta
old
chap
hope
the
practice
prospers
in
your
hands
don
t
kill
the
patients
before
i
come
thine
george
from
this
i
conclude
that
dr
twiddel
is
on
the
festive
side
of
forty
he
reflected
there
are
elements
of
mystery
and
a
general
atmosphere
of
alcohol
about
it
but
that
s
all
i
m
he
put
it
back
in
the
drawer
but
the
bill
he
slipped
into
his
pocket
and
now
thought
he
it
is
time
i
made
the
first
after
waiting
for
a
minute
or
two
to
make
sure
that
everything
was
quiet
he
gently
stepped
out
into
a
little
hall
on
the
right
hand
was
the
front
door
on
the
left
two
others
that
must
he
thought
open
into
rooms
on
the
back
he
chose
the
nearer
at
a
venture
and
entered
boldly
it
was
quite
dark
he
closed
the
door
again
softly
struck
a
match
and
looked
round
the
room
it
seemed
to
be
dr
twiddel
s
and
pipes
photographs
chairs
he
observed
a
he
pulled
aside
the
blind
and
looked
out
into
the
darkness
of
a
strip
of
for
a
minute
he
listened
intently
but
no
sound
came
from
the
house
then
he
threw
up
the
sash
and
scrambled
out
it
was
quite
dark
by
this
time
he
was
enclosed
between
two
rows
of
vague
black
houses
with
bright
windows
here
and
there
and
faintly
cutting
their
uncouth
designs
among
a
few
pale
london
stars
the
space
between
was
filled
with
the
two
lines
of
little
gardens
and
the
ranks
of
walls
and
in
the
middle
the
black
chasm
of
a
railway
cutting
a
frightened
cat
bolted
before
him
as
he
hurried
down
to
the
foot
of
the
strip
but
that
was
all
the
life
he
saw
he
looked
over
the
wall
right
into
the
deep
crevasse
a
little
way
off
on
the
one
hand
hung
a
cluster
of
and
the
shining
rails
reflected
them
all
along
to
the
mouth
of
a
tunnel
on
the
other
turning
his
head
this
way
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
anywhere
else
but
garden
wall
after
garden
wall
it
s
a
choice
between
a
through
these
gardens
a
along
this
wall
and
a
descent
into
the
cutting
he
reflected
the
walls
look
devilish
high
and
the
cutting
devilish
deep
hang
me
if
i
know
which
road
to
while
he
was
still
debating
this
somewhat
perplexing
question
he
felt
the
ground
begin
to
quiver
under
him
through
the
hum
of
london
there
gradually
arose
a
louder
roar
and
in
a
minute
the
of
an
engine
flashed
out
of
the
tunnel
one
after
another
a
string
of
bright
carriages
followed
it
each
more
slowly
than
the
carriage
in
front
till
the
whole
train
was
at
a
standstill
below
him
with
the
red
against
it
in
an
instant
his
decision
was
taken
at
the
peril
of
life
and
garments
he
scrambled
down
the
rocky
bank
picking
as
he
went
an
empty
compartment
and
just
as
the
train
began
to
move
again
he
swung
himself
up
and
sprang
into
a
carriage
unfortunately
he
had
chosen
the
wrong
one
in
his
haste
and
as
he
opened
the
door
he
saw
a
comical
vision
of
a
stout
little
old
gentleman
huddling
into
the
farther
corner
in
the
most
dire
consternation
who
are
you
sir
what
do
you
want
sir
spluttered
the
old
gentleman
if
you
come
any
nearer
me
step
sir
shall
instantly
communicate
with
the
guard
i
have
no
money
about
me
go
away
sir
i
regret
to
learn
that
you
have
no
money
replied
mr
bunker
imperturbably
but
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
not
at
present
in
a
condition
to
offer
a
he
sat
down
and
smiled
amicably
but
the
little
gentleman
was
not
to
be
quieted
so
easily
seeing
that
no
violence
was
apparently
intended
his
fright
changed
into
respectable
indignation
you
needn
t
try
to
be
funny
with
me
sir
you
are
committing
an
illegal
act
you
have
placed
yourself
in
an
uncommonly
serious
position
indeed
sir
replied
mr
bunker
i
myself
should
have
imagined
that
by
remaining
on
the
rails
i
should
have
been
much
more
seriously
the
old
gentleman
looked
at
him
like
an
angry
small
dog
that
longs
to
bite
if
it
only
dared
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
illegal
intrusion
he
demanded
who
are
you
where
did
you
come
from
i
had
the
misfortune
sir
explained
mr
bunker
politely
to
drop
my
hat
out
of
the
window
of
a
neighbouring
carriage
while
i
was
picking
it
up
the
train
started
and
i
had
to
enter
the
first
compartment
i
could
find
i
am
sorry
that
my
entry
frightened
frightened
me
spluttered
the
old
gentleman
i
am
not
afraid
sir
i
am
an
honest
man
who
need
fear
no
one
sir
i
do
not
believe
you
dropped
your
hat
it
is
perfectly
it
may
be
news
to
you
sir
replied
mr
bunker
that
by
gently
yet
firmly
passing
the
sleeve
of
your
coat
round
your
hat
in
the
direction
of
the
nap
it
is
possible
to
restore
the
gloss
thus
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
took
off
his
hat
drew
his
across
it
and
with
a
genial
smile
at
the
old
gentleman
replaced
it
on
his
head
but
his
neighbour
was
evidently
of
that
truculent
disposition
which
merely
growls
at
blandishments
he
snorted
and
replied
testily
that
is
all
very
well
sir
but
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
if
you
prefer
it
then
i
fell
off
the
telegraph
wires
in
an
attempt
to
recover
my
the
old
gentleman
became
purple
in
the
face
have
a
care
sir
i
am
a
director
of
this
company
and
at
the
next
station
i
shall
see
that
you
give
a
proper
account
of
yourself
and
here
we
are
sir
i
trust
you
have
a
more
credible
story
in
as
he
spoke
they
drew
up
beside
an
underground
platform
and
the
irascible
old
gentleman
with
a
very
threatening
face
that
was
not
yet
quite
cleared
of
alarm
bustled
out
in
a
prodigious
hurry
mr
bunker
lay
back
in
his
seat
and
replied
with
a
smile
i
shall
be
delighted
to
tell
any
story
within
the
bounds
of
strict
but
the
moment
he
saw
the
irate
director
disappear
in
the
crowd
he
whipped
out
too
and
with
the
least
possible
delay
transferred
himself
into
a
carriage
from
his
seat
near
the
window
he
watched
the
old
gentleman
hurry
back
with
three
officials
at
his
heels
and
hastily
search
each
compartment
in
turn
the
last
one
was
so
near
him
that
he
could
hear
his
friend
say
damn
it
the
rascal
has
bolted
in
the
crowd
and
with
that
the
four
of
them
rushed
off
to
the
barrier
to
intercept
or
pursue
this
suspicious
character
then
the
whistle
blew
and
as
the
train
moved
off
mr
bunker
remarked
complacently
if
a
little
mysteriously
to
himself
well
whoever
i
am
it
would
seem
i
m
rather
difficult
to
chapter
ix
mr
bunker
arrived
at
the
hôtel
mayonaise
in
what
from
his
appearance
was
an
unusually
reflective
state
of
mind
for
him
the
other
visitors
many
of
whom
had
begun
to
regard
him
and
his
noble
friend
with
great
interest
saw
him
pass
through
the
crowd
in
the
hall
and
about
the
lifts
with
a
thoughtful
air
he
went
straight
to
the
baron
s
room
outside
the
door
he
paused
for
an
instant
to
set
his
face
in
a
cheerful
smile
and
then
burst
gaily
in
upon
his
friend
well
my
dear
baron
he
cried
what
luck
in
the
park
the
baron
was
pulling
his
moustache
over
an
english
novel
he
laid
down
his
book
and
frowned
at
mr
bunker
i
do
not
onderstand
your
english
vays
he
replied
mr
bunker
perceived
that
something
was
very
much
amiss
nor
was
he
without
a
suspicion
of
the
cause
he
laughed
however
and
asked
what
s
the
matter

the
baron
with

solemn
deliberation

the
baron
grunted
with
inarticulate
indignation
and
nearly
pulled
his
moustache
out
by
the
roots
abruptly
he
broke
out
again

i
never

the
difficulty
of
attaching
any
blame
to

seemed
to
have
anything
but
a
soothing
effect
on
the
baron
you
could
almost
fancy
that
you

continued
after

and
that

asked
mr

in
what
seemed
rather
like
a
tone
of
relief
no
suddenly
he
did
turn
back
and
said

ze

laughed
mr

this
applause
served
to
reinstate
the
baron
a
little
in
his
own
good
opinion
he
laughed
too
though
rather
noisily
than
heartily
and
suddenly
became
grave
again
vat

zis
bonker
vat
haf
i
done
vy
should
zey
treat
me
zo
well
you
see
my
dear
baron
his
friend
explained
i
ought
to
have
warned
you
that
it
is
not
usual
in
england
to
address
ladies
you
have
met
at
a
dance
without
some
direct
invitation
on
their
part
at
the
same
time
it
is
evident
that
the
hiltons
and
the
other
man
who
of
course
must
be
connected
with
the
foreign
office
are
aware
of
some
sudden
strain
in
the
diplomatic
relations
between
england
and
germany
which
as
yet
is
unknown
to
the
public
your
ancient
name
and
your
high
rank
have
naturally
led
them
to
conclude
that
you
are
an
agent
of
the
german
government
and
an
international
significance
was
of
course
attached
to
your
presence
in
the
park
i
certainly
think
they
took
a
most
outrageous
advantage
of
a
trifling
detail
of
etiquette
to
repulse
you
but
then
you
must
remember
baron
that
their
families
might
have
been
seriously
compromised
with
the
government
if
they
had
been
seen
with
so
prominent
a
member
of
the
german
aristocracy
in
the
middle
of
hyde
zo
said
the
baron
thoughtfully
i

remain

a
very
select
and

might

egxellent

walked
along
the
esplanade
at
st
egbert
aha
said
the
baron
zis
is
more
fresh
zan
london
yes
replied
his
friend
we
are
now
in
the
presence
of
that
stimulating
element
which
provides
patriotic
britons
with
songs
and
dyspeptic
britons
with
an
a
stirring
breeze
swept
down
the
long
white
esplanade
threatening
hats
and
troubling
skirts
the
sea
rumbled
up
the
shingle
the
day
was
bright
and
pleasant
for
the
time
of
year
and
drove
the
baron
s
mischances
from
his
head
altogether
it
seemed
to
mr
bunker
that
the
omens
were
good
they
were
both
dressed
in
the
smartest
of
tweed
suits
and
walked
jauntily
like
men
who
knew
their
own
value
every
now
and
then
as
they
passed
a
pretty
face
the
baron
would
say
aha
bonker
zat
is
not
so
bad
eh
and
mr
bunker
who
seemed
not
unwilling
that
his
friend
should
find
some
entertaining
distraction
in
st
egbert
s
would
look
at
the
owners
of
these
faces
with
a
prospector
s
eye
and
his
own
unrivalled
assurance
they
had
walked
up
and
down
three
or
four
times
when
a
desire
for
a
different
species
of
diversion
began
to
overtake
the
baron
it
was
the
one
kind
of
desire
that
the
baron
never
even
tried
to
wrestle
with
my
vriend
bonker
said
he
is
it
not
somevere
about
time
for
loncheon
eh
i
should
say
it
was
precisely
the
ha
ha
zen
let
us
gom
and
eat
himmel
zis
sea
is
ze
fellow
to
make
von
hungry
the
baron
had
taken
a
private
suite
of
rooms
on
the
first
floor
of
the
best
hotel
in
st
egbert
s
and
after
a
very
substantial
lunch
mr
bunker
stretched
himself
on
the
luxurious
sofa
and
announced
his
intention
of
having
a
nap
i
shall
go
out
said
the
baron
you
vill
not
gom
i
shall
leave
you
to
make
a
conquest
replied
mr
bunker
besides
i
have
a
little
matter
i
want
to
look
so
the
baron
arranged
his
hat
airily
at
what
he
had
perceived
to
be
the
most
fashionable
and
effective
english
angle
and
strutted
off
to
the
esplanade
it
was
about
two
hours
later
that
he
burst
excitedly
into
the
room
crying
aha
mine
bonker
i
haf
disgovered
zomzing
and
then
he
stopped
in
some
surprise
ello
vat
make
you
my
vriend
his
friend
in
fact
seemed
to
be
somewhat
singularly
employed
through
a
dense
cloud
of
you
could
just
pick
him
out
of
the
depths
of
an
armchair
his
feet
resting
on
the
mantelpiece
while
his
lap
and
all
the
floor
round
about
were
covered
with
immense
books
the
baron
s
curiosity
was
still
further
excited
by
observing
that
they
consisted
principally
of
a
london
and
a
st
egbert
s
directory
several
volumes
of
a
dictionary
of
national
biography
and
one
or
two
peerages
and
county
family
compilations
he
looked
up
with
a
smile
you
may
well
wonder
my
dear
baron
the
fact
is
i
am
looking
for
a
a
name
vat
name
alas
if
i
knew
what
it
was
i
should
stop
looking
and
i
confess
i
m
rather
sick
of
the
vich
vay
do
you
look
zen
simply
by
wading
my
way
through
all
the
lists
of
names
i
could
steal
or
borrow
it
s
devilish
dry
ze
name
of
a
vriend
is
it
yes
but
i
m
afraid
i
must
wait
till
it
comes
and
what
is
this
discovery
baron
a
petticoat
i
presume
after
all
they
are
the
only
things
worth
finding
and
he
shut
the
books
one
after
another
a
petticoat
with
ze
fairest
girl
inside
it
exclaimed
the
baron
rapturously
your
eyes
seem
to
have
been
singularly
penetrating
baron
was
she

or
fair

or

or

how

mr

raised
his
eyebrows
it
s
hardly
the
time
of
year
for
a
romance
to
end
in
a
you
followed
the
divinity
to
her
rented
heaven
perhaps
the
baron
bent
forward
and
answered
in
a
stage
whisper
zey

then
i
can
only
wish

but

the
ha

ve

bonker
she

lofly
the
baron
awaited
dinner
with
even
more
than
his
usual
ardour
he
dressed
with
the
greatest
care
and
at
an
absurdly
early
hour
was
already
urging
his
friend
to
come
down
and
take
their
places
indeed
after
a
time
there
was
no
withholding
him
and
they
finally
took
their
seats
in
the
before
anybody
else
at
what
seemed
to
the
impatient
baron
unconscionably
long
intervals
a
few
people
dropped
in
and
began
to
study
their
menus
and
glance
with
an
air
of
uncomfortable
suspicion
at
their
neighbours
i
vonder
vill

he
said
three
or
four
times
at
least
console
yourself
my
dear
baron
his
friend
would
reply
they
always
come
that
s
seldom
the
and
the
baron
would
dally
with
his

the
most
unwonted
fashion
and

at
the
rapidity
with
which
the
courses
followed

another
do

vish
to
eat
he
began
and
then
laying
his
hand
on
his
friend
s
sleeve
he
whispered
she
goms
mr
bunker
turned
his
head
just
in
time
to
see
in
the
doorway
the
countess
of
grillyer
and
the
lady
alicia
à
fyre
is
she
not
fair
asked
the
baron
excitedly
i
entirely
approve
of
your
taste
baron
i
have
only
once
seen
any
one
quite
like
her
with
a
gratified
smile
the
baron
filled
his
glass
while
his
friend
seemed
amused
by
some
humorous
reflection
of
his
own
the
lady
alicia
and
her
mother
had
taken
their
seats
at
a
table
a
little
way
off
and
at
first
their
eyes
never
happened
to
turn
in
the
direction
of
the
two
friends
but
at
last
after
looking
at
the
ceiling
the
carpet
the
walls
the
other
people
everything
else
in
the
room
it
seemed
lady
alicia
s
glance
fell
for
an
instant
on
the
baron
that
nobleman
looked
as
interesting
as
a
mouthful
of
roast
duck
would
permit
him
but
the
glance
passed
serenely
on
to
mr
bunker
for
a
moment
it
remained
serene
suddenly
it
became
startled
and
puzzled
and
at
that
instant
mr
bunker
turned
his
own
eyes
full
upon
her
smiled
slightly
and
raised
his
glass
to
his
lips
the
glance
fell
and
the
lady
alicia
blushed
down
to
the
diamonds
in
her
necklace
the
baron
insisted
on
lingering
over
his
dinner
till
the
charmer
was
finished
and
so
by
a
fortuitous
coincidence
they
left
the
room
immediately
behind
the
countess
the
baron
passed
them
in
the
passage
and
a
few
yards
farther
he
looked
round
for
his
friend
and
the
countess
turned
to
look
for
her
daughter
they
saw
lady
alicia
following
with
an
intensely
unconscious
expression
while
mr
bunker
was
in
the
act
of
returning
to
the
i
wanted
to
secure
a
table
for
breakfast
he
explained
chapter
ii
the
baron
was
in
high
hopes
of
seeing
the
fair
unknown
at
breakfast
but
it
seemed
she
must
be
either
breakfasting
in
her
own
room
or
lying
long
abed
i
think
i
shall
go
out
for
a
little
constitutional
said
mr
bunker
when
he
had
finished
i
suppose
the
hotel
has
a
stronger
attraction
for
ach
yes
i
shall
remain
his
friend
replied
pairhaps
i
may
see
take
care
then
baron
i
shall
not
propose
till
you
return
bonker
no
said
mr
bunker
to
himself
i
don
t
think
you
just
outside
st
egbert
s
there
is
a
high
breezy
sweep
of
downs
falling
suddenly
to
a
chalky
seaward
cliff
it
overlooks
the
town
and
the
undulating
inland
country
and
a
great
spread
of
shining
sea
and
even
without
a
you
can
see
sail
after
sail
and
after
go
by
all
day
long
but
mr
bunker
had
apparently
walked
there
for
other
reasons
than
to
see
the
view
he
did
stop
once
or
twice
but
it
was
only
to
scan
the
downs
ahead
and
at
the
sight
of
a
fluttering
skirt
he
showed
no
interest
in
anything
else
but
made
a
straight
line
for
its
owner
for
her
part
the
lady
seemed
to
await
his
coming
she
gathered
her
countenance
into
an
expression
of
as
perfect
unconcern
as
a
little
heightening
of
her
colour
would
allow
her
and
returned
his
salute
with
rather
a
distant
bow
but
mr
bunker
was
not
to
be
damped
by
this
hint
of
barbed
wire
he
held
out
his
hand
and
exclaimed
cordially
my
dear
lady
alicia
this
is
charming
of
you
of
course
you
understand
mr
beveridge
it
s
perfectly
he
interrupted
gaily
i
understand
everything
i
should
and
nothing
i
shouldn
t
in
fact
i
have
altered
little
except
in
the
trifling
matter
of
a
beard
a
moustache
or
two
and
by
the
way
a
a
name
i
am
now
francis
bunker
but
as
much
at
your
service
as
but
mean
have
you
really
changed
your
name
circumstances
have
changed
it
just
as
circumstances
shaved
lady
alicia
made
a
great
endeavour
to
look
haughty
i
do
not
quite
understand
temporary
title
but
suggestive
and
simple
for
the
i
do
not
understand
your
conduct
why
have
you
changed
your
name
why
not
this
retort
was
so
evidently
unanswerable
that
lady
alicia
changed
her
inquiry
where
have
you
been
till
yesterday
in
then
you
didn
t
go
to
your
own
parish
she
demanded
reproachfully
there
were
difficulties
he
replied
in
fact
a
certified
lunatic
is
not
in
great
demand
as
a
parish
priest
they
seem
to
prefer
them
but
didn
t
you
try
hard
but
it
was
no
use
the
bishop
was
out
of
town
and
i
had
to
wait
till
his
return
besides
my
position
was
somewhat
insecure
i
have
had
at
least
two
remarkable
escapes
since
i
saw
you
are
you
safe
here
she
asked
hurriedly
with
your
consent
she
looked
a
little
troubled
i
don
t
know
that
i
am
doing
right
mr
thank
you
my
friend
he
interrupted
tenderly
don
t
she
began
hastily
you
mustn
t
talk
francis
beveridge
he
interrupted
the
trouble
is
this
rascal
bunker
bears
an
unconscionably
awkward
resemblance
to
our
old
you
must
see
that
it
is
absurd
he
agreed
perfectly
preposterous
i
laugh
whenever
i
think
of
it
poor
lady
alicia
felt
like
a
man
at
a
telephone
who
has
been
connected
with
the
wrong
person
again
she
made
a
desperate
shift
to
fall
back
on
a
becoming
pride
what
do
you
mean
she
demanded
if
i
mean
anything
at
all
which
is
always
rather
doubtful
he
replied
candidly
i
mean
that
beveridge
and
his
humbug
were
creatures
of
an
occasion
just
as
bunker
and
his
are
of
another
the
one
occasion
is
passed
and
with
it
the
first
entertaining
gentleman
has
vanished
into
space
the
second
gentleman
will
doubtless
follow
when
his
time
is
up
in
fact
i
may
be
said
to
be
a
series
of
dissolving
then
isn
t
what
you
said
true
i
m
afraid
you
must
be
more
specific
you
see
i
ve
talked
so
what
you
said
about
your
he
shook
his
head
humorously
i
have
no
means
of
checking
my
she
looked
at
him
in
a
troubled
way
and
then
her
eyes
fell
at
least
she
said
you
won
mustn
t
treat
me
you
as
beveridge
did
certainly
not
bunker
is
the
soul
of
circumspection
besides
he
doesn
t
require
to
get
out
of
an
then
it
was
only
to
get
away
she
cried
turning
scarlet
let
us
call
it
so
he
replied
looking
pensively
out
to
sea
it
seemed
wiser
to
lady
alicia
to
change
the
subject
who
is
the
friend
you
are
staying
with
she
asked
suddenly
my
old
friend
the
baron
rudolph
von
blitzenberg
and
your
own
most
recent
admirer
he
replied
i
am
at
present
living
with
in
fact
i
may
say
upon
does
he
know
if
you
meet
him
you
had
perhaps
better
not
inquire
into
my
past
i
meant
does
he
know
your
knowing
me
bless
them
thought
mr
bunker
one
forgets
they
re
not
thinking
about
us
my
noble
friend
has
no
idea
that
i
have
been
so
fortunate
he
replied
lady
alicia
looked
relieved
who
is
he
she
asked
a
german
nobleman
of
great
wealth
long
descent
and
the
most
accommodating
disposition
he
is
at
present
exploring
england
under
my
guidance
and
i
flatter
myself
that
he
has
already
seen
and
done
a
number
of
things
that
are
not
on
most
lady
alicia
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
she
said
with
a
little
hesitation
didn
t
you
get
a
letter
from
me
a
letter
no
he
replied
in
some
surprise
i
wrote
you
asked
me
to
and
i
wondered
if
you
were
to
what
address
did
you
write
the
address
you
gave
and
what
was
that
he
asked
still
evidently
puzzled
you
said
care
of
the
archbishop
of
york
would
find
mr
bunker
abruptly
looked
the
other
way
by
jove
he
said
as
if
lost
in
speculation
i
must
find
out
what
the
matter
was
i
can
t
imagine
why
they
haven
t
been
lady
alicia
appeared
a
little
dissatisfied
was
that
a
address
she
asked
suddenly
perfectly
he
replied
as
real
as
pentonville
jail
or
the
house
of
and
as
likely
to
find
me
he
added
to
himself
lady
alicia
seemed
to
hesitate
whether
to
pursue
the
subject
further
but
in
the
middle
of
her
debate
mr
bunker
asked
by
the
way
has
lady
grillyer
any
recollection
of
having
seen
me
before
no
she
doesn
t
remember
you
at
then
we
shall
meet
as
strangers
yes
i
think
it
would
be
better
don
t
you
it
will
save
our
imaginations
lady
alicia
looked
at
him
as
though
she
expected
something
more
but
as
nothing
came
she
said
i
think
it
s
time
i
went
for
the
present
then
my
dear
alicia
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
alicia
it
was
that
rascal
beveridge
who
made
the
slip
it
now
remains
to
make
your
formal
mustn
t
try
the
deuce
is
in
these
people
beginning
with
b
he
laughed
they
seem
to
do
things
without
he
pressed
her
hand
raised
his
hat
and
started
back
to
the
town
she
on
her
part
lingered
to
let
him
get
a
clear
start
of
her
and
her
blue
eyes
looked
as
though
a
breeze
had
blown
across
and
ruffled
them
mr
bunker
had
reached
the
esplanade
and
was
sauntering
easily
back
towards
the
hotel
looking
at
the
people
and
smiling
now
and
then
to
himself
when
he
observed
with
considerable
astonishment
two
familiar
figures
strolling
towards
him
they
were
none
other
than
the
baron
and
the
countess
engaged
in
animated
conversation
and
apparently
on
the
very
best
terms
with
each
other
at
the
sight
of
him
the
baron
beamed
joyfully
aha
bonker
so
you
haf
returned
he
cried
in
ze
meanvile
i
haf
had
vun
great
good
fortune
let
me
present
my
friend
mr
bonker
ze
lady
the
countess
bowed
most
graciously
and
raising
a
pair
of
mounted
on
a
stem
of
the
same
material
looked
at
mr
bunker
through
these
with
a
by
no
means
disapproving
glance
at
first
sight
it
was
evident
that
lady
alicia
must
take
after
her
noble
father
the
countess
was
aquiline
of
nose
large
of
person
and
emphatic
in
her
voice
and
manner
you
are
the
showman
mr
bunker
are
you
not
she
said
with
a
smile
for
which
many
of
her
acquaintances
would
have
given
a
tolerable
percentage
of
their
incomes
it
seems
replied
mr
bunker
smiling
back
agreeably
that
the
baron
is
now
the
showman
and
i
must
congratulate
him
on
his
first
for
an
instant
the
countess
seemed
a
trifle
taken
aback
it
was
a
considerable
number
of
years
since
she
had
been
addressed
in
precisely
this
strain
and
in
fact
at
no
time
had
her
admirers
ventured
quite
so
dashingly
to
the
attack
but
there
was
something
entirely
irresistible
in
mr
bunker
s
manner
partly
perhaps
because
he
never
made
the
mistake
of
heeding
a
first
rebuff
the
countess
coughed
then
smiled
a
little
again
and
said
to
the
baron
you
didn
t
tell
me
that
your
showman
supplied
the
little
speeches
as
i
could
not
know
it
zere
has
not
before
been
ze
reason
for
a
pretty
speech
responded
the
baron
gallantly
if
lady
grillyer
had
been
anybody
else
one
would
have
said
that
she
actually
giggled
certainly
a
little
wave
of
scandalised
satisfaction
rippled
all
over
her
oh
really
she
cried
i
don
t
know
which
of
you
is
the
worst
all
this
time
as
may
be
imagined
mr
bunker
had
been
in
a
state
of
high
mystification
at
his
friend
s
unusual
adroitness
how
the
deuce
did
he
get
hold
of
her
he
said
to
himself
in
the
next
pause
the
baron
solved
the
riddle
you
vil
vunder
bonker
he
said
how
i
did
gom
to
know
ze
lady
i
envied
certainly
replied
his
friend
with
a
side
glance
at
the
now
purring
countess
she
vas
of
my
introdogtions
bot
till
after
you
vent
out
zis
morning
i
did
not
lairn
her
name
zen
i
said
to
myself
ze
sun
shines
himmel
is
kind
here
now
is
ze
fair
lady
introdogtion
and
zo
zat
is
how
you
to
think
of
the
baron
being
here
and
our
only
finding
each
other
out
by
chance
said
the
countess
by
a
fortunate
providence
for
me
exclaimed
the
baron
fervently
baron
said
the
countess
trying
hard
to
look
severe
you
must
really
keep
some
of
these
nice
speeches
for
my
daughter
which
reminds
me
i
wonder
where
she
can
be
ach
here
she
goms
cried
the
baron
why
how
did
you
know
her
asked
the
countess
did
see
her
last
night
at
dinnair
explained
the
baron
turning
red
ah
of
course
i
remember
replied
the
countess
in
a
tone
but
her
motherly
eye
was
sharp
and
already
it
began
to
look
on
the
highly
eligible
rudolph
with
more
approval
than
ever
my
daughter
alicia
the
baron
rudolph
von
blitzenberg
mr
bunker
she
said
the
next
moment
the
baron
went
nearly
double
as
he
bowed
and
the
flourish
of
his
hat
stirred
the
dust
on
the
esplanade
mr
bunker
s
salutation
was
less
profound
but
his
face
expressed
an
almost
equal
degree
of
interested
respect
her
mother
thought
that
when
one
of
the
gentlemen
was
a
nobleman
with
an
indefinite
number
of
thousands
and
the
other
a
person
of
so
much
discrimination
lady
alicia
s
own
bow
might
have
been
a
trifle
less
reserved
but
then
even
the
most
astute
mother
can
not
know
the
reasons
for
everything
chapter
iii
alicia
said
the
countess
it
was
really
a
most
fortunate
coincidence
our
meeting
the
baron
at
st
egbert
she
paused
for
a
reply
and
looked
expectantly
at
her
daughter
it
was
not
the
first
time
in
the
course
of
the
morning
that
lady
alicia
had
listened
to
similar
observations
and
perhaps
that
was
why
she
answered
somewhat
listlessly
yes
wasn
t
it
the
countess
frowned
and
continued
with
emphasis
i
consider
him
one
of
the
most
agreeable
and
best
informed
young
men
i
have
ever
is
he
said
lady
alicia
absently
i
wonder
alicia
you
hadn
t
noticed
it
her
mother
observed
severely
you
talked
with
him
most
of
the
afternoon
i
should
have
thought
that
no
observant
girl
would
have
failed
to
have
been
struck
with
his
air
and
thought
him
very
pleasant
i
am
glad
you
had
so
much
sense
he
is
as
lady
alicia
made
no
reply
the
countess
felt
obliged
to
continue
his
list
of
virtues
herself
he
is
of
most
excellent
family
alicia
one
of
the
oldest
in
bavaria
i
don
t
remember
what
i
heard
his
income
was
in
pfennigs
or
whatever
they
measure
money
by
in
germany
but
i
know
that
it
is
more
than
in
english
money
a
very
large
sum
nowadays
she
added
as
if
had
grown
since
she
was
a
girl
yes
he
is
considered
besides
an
unusually
promising
and
intelligent
young
nobleman
and
in
germany
where
noblemen
are
still
constantly
used
that
says
a
great
deal
for
does
it
mamma
certainly
it
does
education
there
is
so
severe
that
young
englishmen
are
beginning
to
know
less
than
they
ever
did
and
in
most
cases
that
isn
t
saying
much
compare
the
baron
with
the
young
men
you
meet
here
she
looked
at
her
daughter
triumphantly
and
alicia
could
only
reply
yes
mamma
compare
them
and
see
the
difference
look
at
the
baron
s
friend
mr
bunker
who
is
a
very
agreeable
and
amusing
man
i
admit
but
look
at
the
difference
what
is
it
alicia
could
not
help
asking
is
it
alicia
it
is
in
short
the
effect
of
a
carefully
cultivated
mind
and
good
but
don
t
you
think
mr
bunker
cultivated
he
has
an
amusing
way
of
saying
things
then
you
must
remember
that
the
baron
is
doubtless
equally
entertaining
in
his
native
language
possibly
a
superficial
knowledge
of
a
few
of
the
leading
questions
of
the
day
but
the
baron
talked
to
me
for
half
an
hour
on
the
relations
of
something
or
other
in
germany
very
important
point
i
assure
i
always
thought
him
very
clever
said
lady
alicia
with
a
touch
of
warmth
and
then
instantly
changed
colour
at
the
horrible
slip
you
always
said
the
countess
in
alarmed
astonishment
you
hardly
spoke
to
him
yesterday
you
met
him
before
meant
the
baron
but
i
have
just
been
saying
that
he
was
but
i
thought
i
mean
it
seemed
as
though
you
considered
him
only
well
lady
alicia
s
blushes
and
confusion
deepened
her
mother
looked
at
her
with
a
softening
eye
suddenly
she
rose
kissed
her
affectionately
and
said
with
the
tenderness
of
triumph
my
girl
of
course
he
is
clever
well
informed
and
a
most
young
man
my
alicia
could
not
she
stopped
as
if
she
thought
this
was
perhaps
a
little
premature
though
the
countess
s
methods
inclined
to
the
summary
and
decisive
and
again
kissing
her
daughter
affectionately
remarked
gaily
let
me
see
why
it
s
almost
time
we
went
for
our
little
walk
we
mustn
t
really
disappoint
those
young
men
i
am
in
the
middle
of
such
an
amusing
discussion
with
mr
bunker
who
is
really
a
very
sensible
man
and
quite
worthy
of
the
baron
s
poor
lady
alicia
hardly
knew
whether
to
feel
more
relieved
at
her
escape
or
dismayed
at
the
construction
put
upon
her
explanation
she
went
out
to
meet
the
baron
determined
to
give
no
further
colour
to
her
mother
s
unlucky
misconception
the
countess
was
far
too
experienced
and
determined
a
general
to
leave
it
at
all
doubtful
who
should
walk
by
whose
side
and
who
should
have
the
opportunity
of
appreciating
whose
merits
but
lady
alicia
was
quite
resolved
that
the
baron
s
blandishments
should
fall
on
stony
ground
but
a
soft
heart
and
an
undecided
mouth
are
treacherous
companions
the
baron
was
so
amiable
and
so
gallant
that
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
she
was
obliged
to
abate
the
strictness
of
her
resolution
she
should
treat
him
with
the
friendliness
of
a
brother
she
learned
that
he
had
no
sisters
her
decision
was
confirmed
the
enamoured
and
delighted
baron
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
happy
loquacity
he
poured
out
particulars
of
his
travels
his
more
recordable
adventures
his
opinions
on
various
social
and
political
matters
and
at
last
even
of
the
family
ghost
the
hereditary
and
the
glories
of
bavaria
and
lady
alicia
listened
with
what
he
could
not
doubt
was
an
interest
touched
with
tenderness
i
wonder
she
said
artlessly
that
you
find
anything
to
admire
in
with
bavaria
i
two
zings
i
haf
not
zere
replied
the
baron
waving
his
hand
round
towards
the
horizon
vun
is
ze
vet
sheet
of
flowing
not
your
poet
so
ze
ozzer
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
is
ze
lady
alicia
à
there
are
some
people
who
catch
sentiment
whenever
it
happens
to
be
in
the
air
just
as
others
almost
equally
unfortunate
regularly
take
lady
alicia
s
reply
was
much
softer
than
she
intended
especially
as
she
could
have
told
anybody
that
the
baron
s
compliment
was
the
merest
figure
of
speech
you
needn
t
have
included
me
i
m
sure
not
a
great
ze
sea
is
less
so
zat
leaves
none
the
baron
smiled
didn
t
you
see
mean
anything
in
london
that
attracted
you
liked
zat
i
liked
yes
zat
pairhaps
for
the
moment
attracted
me
but
not
zat
shall
still
attract
me
ven
i
am
gone
the
baron
sighed
this
time
and
she
felt
impelled
to
reply
with
the
most
sisterly
kindness
should
of
course
like
to
think
that
you
didn
t
forget
us
you
need
not
then
lady
alicia
began
to
realise
that
this
was
more
like
a
second
cousin
than
a
brother
and
with
sudden
sprightliness
she
cried
i
wonder
where
that
steamer
s
going
the
baron
turned
his
eyes
towards
his
attraction
but
for
a
professed
lover
of
the
ocean
his
interest
appeared
slight
he
only
replied
absently
ach
zo
a
little
way
behind
them
walked
mr
bunker
and
the
countess
the
attention
of
lady
grillyer
was
divided
between
the
agreeable
conversation
of
her
companion
and
the
pleasant
spectacle
of
a
fabulous
number
of
pfennigs
bending
its
titled
head
over
her
daughter
in
the
middle
of
one
of
mr
bunker
s
most
amusing
stories
she
could
not
forbear
interrupting
with
a
complacent
they
make
a
very
handsome
couple
mr
bunker
politely
stopped
his
narrative
and
looked
critically
from
his
friend
s
gaily
checked
back
to
lady
alicia
s
trim
figure
pray
go
on
with
your
story
mr
bunker
said
the
countess
hastily
realising
that
she
had
thought
a
little
too
loudly
they
are
like
responded
mr
bunker
replying
to
her
first
they
are
like
a
pair
of
the
countess
raised
her
brows
and
looked
at
him
sharply
i
mean
of
course
the
best
i
think
said
the
countess
suspiciously
that
you
spoke
a
little
my
simile
was
a
little
premature
i
think
so
said
the
countess
decisively
let
us
call
them
then
an
odd
pair
smiled
mr
bunker
unruffled
and
only
hope
that
they
ll
turn
out
to
be
the
same
size
and
different
the
countess
actually
condescended
to
smile
back
she
is
a
child
she
murmured
his
income
i
think
is
sufficient
he
answered
humour
was
not
conspicuous
in
the
grillyer
family
the
countess
replied
seriously
i
am
one
of
those
people
mr
bunker
who
consider
some
things
come
before
money
but
the
baron
s
birth
and
position
are
fortunately
while
his
mental
qualities
said
mr
bunker
are
in
my
experience
almost
the
countess
was
confirmed
in
her
opinion
of
mr
bunker
s
discrimination
late
that
night
after
they
had
parted
with
their
friends
the
baron
smoked
in
the
most
unwonted
silence
while
mr
bunker
dozed
on
the
sofa
several
times
rudolph
threw
restive
glances
at
his
friend
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
that
he
needed
a
helping
hand
to
unburden
himself
of
at
last
the
silence
grew
so
intolerable
that
he
screwed
up
his
courage
and
with
desperate
resolution
exclaimed
bonker
mr
bunker
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
up
bonker
i
am
in
loff
mr
bunker
smiled
and
stretched
himself
out
again
i
have
also
been
in
love
he
replied
you
are
not
now
alas
vy
alas
because
follies
illusions
get
so
infernally
dull
the
baron
smiled
a
little
foolishly
i
haf
ze
illusions
i
then
he
broke
out
enthusiastically
ach
bot
is
she
not
lofly
bonker
if
she
will
bot
lof
me
back
i
shall
be
ze
happiest
man
out
of
heaven
you
have
wasted
no
time
the
baron
shook
his
head
in
melancholy
pleasure
you
are
quite
sure
it
is
really
love
this
time
his
friend
pursued
qvite
said
the
baron
with
the
firmness
of
a
martyr
there
are
so
many
not
so
close
zat
zey
can
deceive
ha
ha
ha
laughed
mr
bunker
these
first
symptoms
are
common
to
them
all
and
yet
the
varieties
of
the
disease
are
almost
beyond
counting
i
myself
have
suffered
from
it
in
eight
different
forms
there
was
the
virulent
variety
known
as
there
was
the
kind
that
accompanied
itself
by
a
course
of
the
restoration
dramatists
another
form
i
may
call
the
and
that
may
be
subdivided
into
at
least
two
then
there
schtop
schtop
cried
the
baron
ha
ha
ha
zat
will
do
teufel
i
most
examine
my
heart
strictly
and
yet
bonker
i
zink
my
loff
is
anozzer
they
are
all
that
baron
but
have
it
your
own
way
anything
i
can
do
to
make
you
worse
shall
be
zanks
my
best
of
friends
said
the
baron
warmly
seizing
his
hand
i
knew
you
would
stand
by
me
mr
bunker
gave
a
little
laugh
and
returning
the
pressure
replied
my
dear
fellow
i
d
do
anything
to
oblige
a
friend
in
such
an
interesting
chapter
iv
the
baron
was
a
few
minutes
late
in
joining
the
party
at
lunch
and
when
he
appeared
he
held
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
it
was
only
the
middle
of
the
next
day
and
yet
he
could
have
sworn
that
last
night
he
was
comparatively
he
felt
so
very
much
more
in
love
already
yet
anozzer
introdogtion
has
found
me
out
he
said
as
he
took
his
seat
i
have
here
a
letter
of
invitation
vich
i
do
not
zink
i
shall
he
threw
an
amorous
glance
at
lady
alicia
which
her
watchful
mother
rightly
interpreted
as
indicating
the
cause
of
his
intended
refusal
who
is
it
this
time
asked
mr
bunker
sir
richard
brierley
of
brierley
park
dampshire
is
zat
how
you
pronounce
it
sir
richard
brierley
exclaimed
the
countess
why
alicia
and
i
are
going
to
visit
some
relatives
of
ours
who
live
only
six
miles
from
brierley
park
when
has
he
asked
you
baron
ze
end
of
next
how
odd
we
are
going
down
to
dampshire
at
the
end
of
next
week
too
you
must
accept
baron
i
shall
exclaimed
the
overjoyed
baron
shall
ve
go
bonker
i
m
not
asked
i
m
ach
bot
zat
is
nozzing
i
shall
tell
as
you
please
baron
replied
mr
bunker
with
a
half
glance
at
lady
alicia
the
infatuated
baron
had
already
begun
to
dread
the
inevitable
hour
of
separation
and
this
piece
of
good
fortune
put
him
into
the
highest
spirits
he
felt
so
amiable
towards
the
whole
world
that
when
the
four
went
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
afternoon
he
lingered
for
a
minute
by
lady
grillyer
s
side
and
in
that
minute
mr
bunker
and
lady
alicia
were
out
of
hail
ahead
the
baron
s
face
fell
shall
i
come
down
to
this
place
said
mr
bunker
would
you
like
to
i
should
be
sorry
he
replied
to
part
lady
alicia
had
expected
a
slightly
different
ending
to
this
sentence
and
so
to
tell
the
truth
mr
bunker
had
intended
oh
if
you
can
t
stay
away
from
the
baron
you
had
better
it
is
certainly
very
hard
to
tear
myself
away
from
so
charming
a
person
as
the
baron
perhaps
you
can
feel
for
me
i
think
he
is
he
thinks
you
very
does
he
said
lady
alicia
with
great
indifference
and
a
moment
later
changed
the
subject
meanwhile
the
baron
was
growing
very
uneasy
of
course
it
was
quite
natural
that
mr
bunker
should
find
it
pleasant
to
walk
for
a
few
minutes
by
the
side
of
the
fairest
creature
on
earth
and
very
possibly
he
was
artfully
pleading
his
friend
s
cause
yet
the
baron
felt
uneasy
he
remembered
mr
bunker
s
invariable
success
with
the
gentler
sex
his
wit
his
happy
smile
and
his
good
looks
and
he
began
to
wish
most
sincerely
that
these
fascinations
were
being
exercised
on
the
now
somewhat
breathless
countess
for
his
efforts
to
overtake
the
pair
in
front
had
both
annoyed
and
exhausted
lady
grillyer
need
we
walk
quite
so
fast
baron
she
suggested
and
lady
grillyer
s
suggestions
were
of
the
kind
that
are
evidently
meant
to
be
acted
upon
ach
i
did
forged
said
the
baron
absently
and
without
further
remark
he
slackened
his
pace
for
a
few
yards
and
then
was
off
again
you
were
telling
me
gasped
the
countess
of
something
you
thought
zo
oh
yes
it
i
do
not
really
baron
said
the
countess
decidedly
i
can
not
go
any
farther
at
this
rate
let
us
turn
the
others
will
be
turning
too
in
a
in
fact
the
unlucky
baron
had
clean
run
lady
grillyer
s
maternal
instincts
off
their
feet
and
he
suffered
for
it
by
seeing
nothing
of
either
his
friend
or
his
charmer
for
an
hour
and
a
half
that
night
he
accepted
sir
richard
s
invitation
but
said
nothing
whatever
about
bringing
a
friend
for
the
next
week
rudolph
was
in
as
many
states
of
mind
as
there
were
hours
in
each
day
he
walked
and
rode
and
drove
with
lady
alicia
through
the
most
romantic
spots
he
could
find
he
purchased
a
large
assortment
of
and
under
her
tuition
essayed
to
play
that
most
dangerous
of
games
for
mixed
couples
in
turn
he
broke
every
club
in
his
set
the
cavities
he
hewed
in
the
links
are
still
pointed
out
to
the
curious
but
the
heart
of
the
lady
alicia
alone
he
seemed
unable
to
damage
there
was
always
a
moment
at
which
his
courage
failed
him
and
in
that
fatal
pause
she
invariably
changed
the
subject
with
the
most
innocent
air
in
the
world
every
now
and
then
the
greenest
spasms
of
jealousy
would
seize
him
why
did
she
elect
to
disappear
with
mr
bunker
on
the
very
morning
that
he
had
resolved
should
settle
his
fate
it
is
true
he
had
made
the
same
resolution
every
morning
but
on
this
particular
one
he
had
no
doubt
he
would
have
put
his
fate
to
the
touch
and
why
on
a
certain
moonlight
evening
was
he
left
to
the
unsentimental
company
of
the
countess
he
made
no
further
reference
to
the
visit
to
brierley
park
in
fact
he
shunned
discussion
of
any
kind
with
his
quondam
bosom
friend
the
time
slipped
past
till
the
visit
to
st
egbert
s
was
almost
at
an
end
on
the
day
after
all
four
were
going
to
leave
where
mr
bunker
was
going
his
friend
never
troubled
to
inquire
they
sat
together
latish
in
the
evening
in
the
baron
s
room
that
very
afternoon
lady
alicia
had
spent
more
time
in
mr
bunker
s
society
than
in
his
and
the
baron
felt
that
the
hour
had
come
for
an
explanation
bonker
i
haf
a
suspection
he
exclaimed
suddenly
it
is
not

my
dear
baron

not
doing
me

the
baron
reiterated
my
dear
fellow
replied
mr
bunker
it

you

the
baron
moodily
have
you

the
question

my
dear
baron
whose
fault
is
that
the
baron
was
silent

said
the
baron
sadly
she
treats
me
not
like
a
lover
she
talks
of
friendship
i
do
not
vish
a
frient
mr
bunker
looked
thoughtfully
up
at
the
ceiling
you
don
t
think
you
have
touched
her
heart
he
asked
at
length
i
fear
you
must
try
an
infallible
recipe
for
winning
a
woman
s
heart
you
must
be
in
in
trouble
i
have
tried
it
once
myself

bot

artfully

rooms

then
baron
you
must
be
laid
up
ill
or
not
just
as
you
please
a
grain
of
lady
alicia

sympathy
is
worth
more
than
a
ton
of
even
your
the
standard
chosen
for
the
measurement
of
his
wit
escaped
the
baron
the
scheme

him
ha

he
cried
how

do

reflected
and
his
smile
died
away
sopposing
he
said
slowly

next
morning
the
two
conspirators
breakfasted
early
the
baron
seemed
a
little
nervous
now
that
it
came
so
near
the
venture
but
his
friend
was
as
cheerful
as
a
schoolboy
and
his
confident
air
soon
put
fresh
courage
into
rudolph
mr
bunker
s
bedroom
opened
out
of
their
common
and
so
he
declared
that
in
the
afternoon
the
baron
must
be
laid
up
there
keep
your
room
all
morning
he
said
and
look
as
pale
as
you
can
i
shall
make
my
room
ready
for
when
the
baron
had
retired
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
gazed
for
a
few
minutes
round
his
bedroom
then
he
rang
his
bell
ordered
the
servant
to
make
the
bed
immediately
and
presently
went
out
to
do
some
shopping
on
the
way
he
sent
word
to
the
countess
telling
her
only
that
the
baron
was
indisposed
but
that
in
spite
of
this
misfortune
he
hoped
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
their
company
at
tea
the
rest
of
the
morning
he
spent
in
his
bedroom
prudently
keeping
out
of
the
ladies
way
when
after
a
substantial
lunch
which
he
insisted
upon
getting
up
to
eat
the
baron
was
allowed
to
enter
the
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
indeed
his
surprise
was
natural
the
room
was
as
full
of
flowers
as
a
conservatory
chairs
wardrobe
and
fireplace
were
most
artistically
draped
with
art
hangings
a
plate
filled
with
grapes
a
large
bottle
labelled
two
every
half
hour
and
a
were
placed
conspicuously
on
a
small
table
and
most
remarkable
feature
of
all
mr
bunker
s
bath
filled
with
water
and
alive
with
goldfish
stood
by
the
side
of
the
bed
a
couple
of
canaries
sang
in
a
cage
by
the
window
the
curtains
only
permitted
the
most
delicate
light
to
steal
into
the
room
and
in
short
the
whole
arrangement
reflected
the
utmost
credit
on
his
ingenious
friend
the
baron
was
delighted
but
a
little
puzzled
vat
for
are
zese
fishes
and
ze
canaries
he
asked
to
show
your
love
of
vy
so
there
is
nothing
that
pleases
a
woman
my
friend
you
zink
of
everyzing
exclaimed
the
baron
admiringly
when
four
o
clock
approached
he
drew
a
over
his
other
garments
and
got
into
bed
mr
bunker
at
first
was
in
favour
of
a
complete
change
of
attire
but
on
his
friend
s
expostulating
against
such
a
thorough
precaution
he
admitted
that
it
would
be
perhaps
rather
like
the
historic
blacking
of
othello
leave
it
all
to
me
my
dear
baron
he
said
reassuringly
as
he
tucked
him
in
and
with
that
he
went
into
the
other
room
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
their
guests
they
came
punctually
the
countess
was
full
of
concern
for
the
dear
baron
while
lady
alicia
he
could
not
help
thinking
appeared
unusually
reserved
in
fact
his
quick
eye
soon
divined
that
something
was
the
matter
she
has
either
been
getting
a
lecture
from
the
dowager
or
has
found
something
out
he
said
to
himself
however
it
seemed
that
if
she
had
found
anything
out
it
could
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
baron
s
indisposition
for
she
displayed
the
most
ingenuous
sympathy
and
he
thought
she
even
appeared
to
aim
it
pointedly
at
himself
so
sudden
exclaimed
the
countess
it
is
rather
sudden
but
we
ll
hope
it
may
pass
as
quickly
as
it
came
said
mr
bunker
conveying
a
skilful
impression
of
deep
concern
veiled
by
a
cheerful
manner
tell
me
honestly
mr
bunker
is
it
dangerous
demanded
the
countess
mr
bunker
hesitated
gave
a
laugh
and
replied
oh
dear
no
that
present
lady
grillyer
we
have
really
no
reason
to
be
i
am
sorry
murmured
lady
alicia
her
mother
looked
at
her
approvingly
poor
baron
she
said
in
a
tone
of
the
greatest
commiseration
so
far
from
home
sighed
mr
bunker
and
yet
so
cheerful
through
it
all
he
added
what
did
you
say
was
the
matter
asked
the
countess
mr
bunker
had
thought
it
both
wiser
and
more
effective
to
maintain
a
little
mystery
round
his
friend
s
malady
the
doctor
hasn
t
yet
given
a
decided
opinion
he
replied
can
t
we
do
anything
said
lady
alicia
softly
mr
bunker
thought
the
guests
were
nearly
worked
up
to
the
proper
pitch
of
sympathy
poor
rudolph
he
exclaimed
it
would
cheer
him
immensely
i
know
and
ease
my
own
anxiety
as
well
if
you
would
venture
in
to
see
him
for
a
few
minutes
in
such
a
case
there
is
no
sympathy
so
welcome
as
a
woman
the
countess
glanced
at
her
daughter
and
wavered
for
an
instant
between
those
proprieties
for
which
she
was
a
famous
stickler
and
this
admirable
chance
of
completing
the
baron
s
conquest
his
relations
are
far
away
said
mr
bunker
looking
pensively
out
of
the
window
we
might
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
alicia
suggested
lady
grillyer
yes
mamma
replied
lady
alicia
with
an
alacrity
that
rather
surprised
their
host
with
a
pleasantly
dejected
air
he
ushered
the
ladies
into
the
darkened
the
baron
striving
to
conceal
his
exultation
under
a
rueful
semblance
greeted
them
with
a
languid
yet
happy
smile
ah
lady
grillyer
zis
is
kind
indeed
and
you
lady
alicia
how
can
i
zank
you
my
daughter
and
i
are
much
distressed
baron
to
find
our
host
de
said
the
countess
graciously
just
when
you
wanted
to
go
away
too
added
lady
alicia
sympathetically
the
baron
emitted
a
happy
blend
of
sigh
and
groan
alas
he
replied
it
is
hard
you
must
hurry
up
and
get
better
said
the
countess
in
her
most
cheering
manner
it
won
t
do
to
disappoint
the
brierleys
you
you
must
come
down
for
of
the
time
smiled
her
daughter
these
expressions
of
sympathy
so
affected
the
baron
that
he
placed
his
hand
on
his
brow
and
turned
slightly
away
to
conceal
his
emotion
at
the
same
time
mr
bunker
with
dramatic
effect
sank
wearily
into
a
chair
and
laying
his
elbow
on
the
back
hid
his
own
face
in
his
hand
their
guests
jumped
to
the
most
alarming
conclusions
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
great
concern
dear
me
said
the
countess
surely
it
isn
t
so
very
serious
mr
bunker
it
isn
t
is
it
the
unlucky
baron
here
made
his
first
mistake
without
waiting
for
his
more
diplomatic
friend
to
reply
he
answered
hastily
ach
no
it
is
bot
a
lady
grillyer
s
expression
changed
a
cold
she
said
dear
me
that
can
t
be
so
very
serious
it
is
a
bad
cold
said
the
baron
by
this
time
the
ladies
eyes
were
growing
more
used
to
the
dim
light
and
mr
bunker
could
see
that
they
were
taking
rapid
stock
of
the
garnishings
this
i
suppose
is
your
said
the
countess
examining
the
bottle
the
baron
incautiously
admitted
it
was
two
every
half
hour
she
exclaimed
why
i
never
heard
of
taking
a
in
such
doses
besides
your
cough
doesn
t
seem
so
very
bad
ze
doctor
told
me
to
take
it
so
replied
the
baron
the
countess
turned
towards
mr
bunker
and
said
with
a
touch
of
suspicion
in
her
voice
i
thought
mr
bunker
the
doctor
had
given
no
the
baron
threw
a
glance
of
intense
ferocity
at
his
friend
in
the
baron
s
desire
to
spare
your
feelings
replied
mr
bunker
gravely
he
has
been
a
little
inaccurate
that
is
not
precisely
an
ordinary
oh
said
the
countess
lady
alicia
s
attention
had
been
strongly
attracted
by
the
bath
and
suddenly
she
exclaimed
why
there
are
goldfish
in
it
the
baron
s
nerve
was
fast
deserting
him
ze
doctor
ordered
zem
he
i
mean
i
am
fond
of
the
countess
looked
hard
at
the
unhappy
young
man
and
then
turned
severely
to
his
friend
is
the
matter
with
the
baron
she
demanded
mr
bunker
saw
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
heroic
measures
the
dog
was
destroyed
at
once
he
replied
with
intense
gravity
it
is
therefore
impossible
to
say
exactly
what
is
the
dog
cried
the
two
ladies
together
by
this
evening
he
continued
we
shall
know
the
the
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
the
countess
withdrawing
a
step
from
the
bed
i
mean
replied
mr
bunker
with
a
happy
inspiration
that
this
bath
is
a
delicate
test
no
victim
of
the
dread
disease
of
hydrophobia
can
bear
to
but
the
countess
gave
him
no
time
to
finish
even
as
he
was
speaking
the
baron
s
face
had
passed
through
a
series
of
the
most
extraordinary
expressions
which
she
not
unnaturally
put
down
to
premonitory
symptoms
it
s
beginning
already
she
shrieked
alicia
my
love
come
quickly
how
dare
you
expose
us
sir
calm
yourselves
i
assure
pleaded
mr
bunker
coming
hastily
after
them
but
they
were
at
the
door
before
him
the
hapless
baron
could
stand
it
no
longer
crying
no
no
it
is
false
he
sprang
out
of
bed
arrayed
in
a
tweed
suit
only
half
concealed
by
his
and
forgetting
all
about
the
bath
descended
with
a
great
splash
among
the
startled
goldfish
the
countess
paused
in
the
door
and
looked
at
him
with
horror
that
rapidly
passed
into
intense
indignation
i
am
not
ill
he
cried
it
vos
zat
rascal
bonker
s
plot
he
made
me
i
haf
not
hydrophobia
most
unkindest
cut
of
all
lady
alicia
went
off
into
hysterical
giggles
for
a
moment
her
mother
glared
at
the
two
young
men
in
silence
and
then
only
remarking
i
have
never
been
so
insulted
before
she
went
out
and
her
daughter
followed
her
as
the
door
closed
mr
bunker
went
off
into
roar
after
roar
of
laughter
but
the
humorous
side
of
the
situation
seemed
to
appeal
very
slightly
to
his
injured
friend
you
rascal
you
villain
he
shouted
zis
is
ze
end
of
our
friendship
bonker
do
you
use
ze
pistols
tell
me
sare
my
dear
baron
gasped
mr
bunker
i
could
not
put
such
an
inartistic
end
to
so
fine
a
joke
for
the
you
vill
not
fight
coward
poltroon
i
know
not
ze
english
name
bad
enoff
for

with
difficulty
mr
bunker
composed
himself
and
replied
still
smiling
after
all
baron
what
harm
has
been
done
i
get
all
the
blame
and
the
sympathy
you
wanted
is
sure
to
turn
to
false
friend
thundered
the
baron
my
dear
baron
said
mr
bunker
mildly
whose
fault
was
it
that
the
plot
miscarried
if
you
d
only
left
it
all
to
left
it
to
you
yes
i
left
too
moch
to
you
traitor
it
vas
a
trick
to
vin
ze
lady
alicia
for
yourself
speak
to
me
nevermore
and
with
that
the
infuriated
nobleman
rushed
off
to
his
own
room
as
there
was
no
further
sign
of
him
for
the
next
half
hour
mr
bunker
still
smiling
to
himself
at
the
recollection
went
out
to
take
the
air
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
descend
the
stairs
he
spied
lady
alicia
lingering
in
a
passage
he
turned
back
and
went
up
to
her
she
began
at
once
in
a
low
hurried
voice
that
seemed
to
have
a
strain
of
anger
running
beneath
it
i
got
the
two
letters
i
wrote
you
returned
to
me
through
the
office
nothing
was
known
about
you
at
the
address
you
i
am
not
surprised
he
replied
then
it
was
false
as
an
address
it
was
perfectly
genuine
only
it
didn
t
happen
to
be
were
you
in
the
church
not
to
my
personal
yet
you
said
you
were
i
was
in
an
she
looked
up
at
him
with
fine
contempt
while
he
smiled
back
at
her
with
great
amusement
you
have
deceived
she
said
and
you
have
treated
your
other
is
far
too
good
for
have
you
anything
to
say
for
yourself
not
a
word
he
replied
cheerfully
you
must
treat
me
again
i
let
as
a
smile
played
for
an
instant
about
his
face
she
added
quickly
i
don
t
i
shall
ever
see
you
again
in
future
we
are
not
to
the
lady
and
the
lunatic
said
he
well
perhaps
not
and
better
she
answered
coldly
and
added
as
they
parted
my
mother
of
course
is
extremely
angry
with
there
he
said
with
a
smile
you
see
i
still
come
in
she
hurried
away
and
mr
bunker
walked
slowly
downstairs
and
out
of
the
hotel
it
seems
to
me
he
reflected
that
i
shall
have
to
set
out
on
my
adventures
again
chapter
vi
the
baron
s
natural
good
temper
might
have
forgiven
his
friend
but
all
night
he
was
a
prey
to
something
against
which
no
temper
is
proof
the
baron
was
bitterly
jealous
all
through
breakfast
he
never
spoke
a
word
and
when
mr
bunker
asked
him
what
train
he
intended
to
take
he
replied
curtly
as
he
went
to
the
door
ze
and
where
do
you
go
now
vat
is
zat
to
you
i
go
for
a
valk
i
vould
be
then

said
mr
bunker
i
think
i
shall
go
up
to

replied
the
baron
opening
the
door
i
haf
no
furzer
vish
to
see
a
treacherous
zat
vill
neizer
be
true
nor
fight
bot
jost
takes
he
slammed
the
door
and
went
out
if
he
had
waited
for
a
moment
he
would
have
seen
a
look
in
mr
bunker
s
face
that
he
had
never
seen
before
he
half
started
from
his
chair
to
follow
and
then
sat
down
again
and
thought
with
his
lips
very
tight
set
all
at
once
they
broke
into
a
smile
that
was
grimmer
than
anything
the
baron
had
known
i
accept
your
challenge
baron
rudolph
von
blitzenberg
he
said
to
himself
but
the
weapons
i
shall
choose
he
took
a
telegraph
form
wrote
and
despatched
a
wire
and
then
with
considerable
haste
proceeded
to
pack
within
an
hour
he
had
left
the
hotel
when
a
servant
later
in
the
day
was
performing
under
the
baron
s
directions
the
same
office
for
him
a
series
of
discoveries
that
still
further
disturbed
his
peace
of
mind
were
jointly
made
not
only
the
more
sporting
portions
of
his
wardrobe
but
his
gun
and
cartridges
as
well
had
vanished
and
search
and
storm
as
he
liked
there
was
not
a
trace
of
them
to
be
found
ze
rascal
he
muttered
i
did
not
zink
he
was
zief
as
it
is
hardly
wonderful
that
he
arrived
at
brierley
station
in
anything
but
an
amiable
frame
of
mind
there
to
his
great
annoyance
and
surprise
he
found
no
signs
of
sir
richard
s
carriage
there
were
no
stables
near
and
after
fuming
for
some
time
on
the
platform
he
was
forced
to
leave
his
luggage
with
the
and
proceed
on
foot
to
brierley
park
he
arrived
shortly
before
seven
o
clock
after
a
dark
and
muddy
tramp
and
still
swearing
under
his
breath
pulled
the
bell
with
indignant
energy
i

blitzenberg

informed

suspiciously

morning

said

said
the
butler
turning
away
presently
a
stout
florid
gentleman
accompanied
by
three
friends
all
evidently
very
curious
and
amused
about
something
came
to
the
door
and
to
the
poor
baron
s
amazement
and
horror
he
recognised
in
one
of
these
none
other
than
mr
bunker
arrayed
with
much
splendour
in
his
own
ornate
shooting
suit
what

the
florid

you
vill
see
ze
so
completely
did
the
baron
lose
his
head
that
he
became
almost
inarticulate
with
rage
his
protestations
however
were
not
of
the
slightest
avail
that
morning
sir
richard
had
received
a
wire
informing
him
that
the
baron
was
coming
by
an
earlier
train
than
he
had
originally
intended
and
since
his
arrival
the
spurious
nobleman
had
so
ingratiated
himself
with
his
host
that
sir
richard
was
filled
with
nothing
but
sympathy
for
him
in
his
persecution
after
a
desperate
struggle
the
unfortunate
rudolph
was
overpowered
and
conveyed
in
the
undignified
fashion
known
as
the
frog
s
march
to
a
room
in
a
remote
wing
there
to
pass
the
night
under
lock
and
key
the
scoundrelly
german
impostor
exclaimed
a
young
man
a
fellow
visitor
of
the
baron
bunker
s
to
a
tall
gentleman
colonel
savage
seemed
lost
in
thought
it
is
a
curious
thing
trelawney
he
replied
at
length
that
the
footman
who
attends
the
baron
should
have
told
my
of
course
told
a
number
of
his
things
are
marked
francis
it
is
also
rather
strange
that
this
impostor
should
have
known
so
little
of
the
baron
s
movements
as
to
arrive
several
hours
after
him
assuming
he
had
hatched
a
plot
to
impersonate
but
the
man
s
obviously
must
be
said
the
colonel
the
house
party
were
assembled
in
the
waiting
for
dinner
to
be
announced
the
bogus
baron
was
engaged
in
an
animated
discussion
with
colonel
savage
on
the
subject
of
bavarian
shootings
and
the
colonel
having
omitted
to
inform
him
that
he
had
some
personal
experience
of
these
mr
bunker
was
serving
up
such
of
his
friend
s
anecdotes
as
he
could
remember
with
sauce
more
peculiarly
his
own
five
hondred
vild
boars
he
was
saying
eight
hondred
brace
of
partridges
many
bears
and
rabbits
so
moch
zat
it
took
five
veeks
to
bury
zem
all
zese
ve
did
shoot
before
breakfast
colonel
aftair
breakfast
again
ve
did
go
but
at
that
moment
his
attention
was
sharply
arrested
by
a
question
of
lady
brierley
s
has
dr
escott
arrived
she
asked
the
baron
bunker
paused
and
in
spite
of
his
habitual
coolness
the
observant
colonel
noticed
that
he
started
ever
so
slightly
he
came
half
an
hour
ago
replied
sir
richard
ah
here
he
as
he
spoke
a
figure
came
into
the
room
and
after
a
welcome
from
his
hostess
the
dinner
procession
started
whoever
is
that
tall
fair
man
in
front
dr
escott
asked
his
partner
as
they
crossed
the
hall
oh
that
s
the
baron
von
blitzenberg
such
an
amusing
man
we
are
all
in
love
with
him
all
through
dinner
the
spurious
baron
saw
that
dr
escott
s
eyes
turned
continually
and
curiously
on
him
yet
never
for
an
instant
did
his
spirits
droop
or
his
conversation
flag
witty
and
charming
as
ever
he
discoursed
in
his
comical
foreign
accent
to
the
amusement
of
all
within
hearing
and
by
the
time
the
gentlemen
adjourned
to
the
he
had
established
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
delightful
german
ever
seen
yet
dr
escott
grew
more
suspicious
and
bewildered
and
mr
bunker
felt
that
he
was
being
narrowly
watched
the
skill
at
billiards
of
a
certain
francis
beveridge
used
to
be
the
object
of
the
doctor
s
unbounded
admiration
and
it
was
with
the
liveliest
interest
that
he
watched
a
game
between
colonel
savage
and
the
baron
that
nobleman
knew
well
the
danger
of
displaying
his
old
dexterity
and
to
the
onlookers
it
soon
became
apparent
that
this
branch
of
his
education
had
been
neglected
he
not
only
missed
the
simplest
shots
but
seemed
very
ignorant
of
the
rules
of
the
english
game
and
in
consequence
he
came
in
for
a
little
chaff
from
sir
richard
and
trelawney
when
the
colonel
s
score
stood
at
and
the
baron
had
scarcely
reached
trelawney
cried
i
ll
bet
you
ten
to
one
you
don
t
win
baron
what
in
asked
the
baron
and
the
colonel
noticed
that
for
the
first
time
be
pronounced
a
correctly
sovereigns
said
trelawney
gaily
the
temptation
was
irresistible
done
said
the
baron
with
a
professional
disregard
for
conventions
he
bolted
the
white
into
the
middle
pocket
leaving
his
own
ball
nicely
beside
the
red
down
in
its
turn
went
the
red
and
mr
bunker
was
on
the
spot
three
followed
three
in
monotonous
succession
trelawney
s
face
growing
longer
and
dr
escott
getting
more
and
more
excited
till
with
a
smile
mr
bunker
laid
down
his
cue
a
sensational
winner
his
victory
was
received
in
silence
trelawney
handed
over
two
notes
without
a
word
and
the
colonel
returned
to
his
dr
escott
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
whispering
something
to
sir
richard
the
two
left
the
room
imperturbable
as
ever
mr
bunker
talked
gaily
for
a
few
minutes
to
an
unresponsive
audience
and
then
remarking
that
he
would
join
the
ladies
left
the
room
a
minute
or
two
later
sir
richard
with
an
anxious
face
returned
with
dr
escott
where
is
the
baron
he
asked
gone
to
join
the
ladies
replied
trelawney
adding
under
his
breath
n
him
but
the
baron
was
not
with
the
ladies
nor
search
the
house
as
they
might
was
there
a
trace
to
be
seen
of
that
accomplished
nobleman
he
has
gone
said
sir
richard
what
the
deuce
is
the
meaning
of
it
exclaimed
trelawney
colonel
savage
smiled
grimly
and
suggested
perhaps
he
wants
to
give
the
impostor
an
dr
escott
i
think
can
tell
you
replied
the
baronet
gentlemen
said
the
doctor
the
man
whom
you
have
met
as
the
baron
von
blitzenberg
is
none
other
than
a
most
cunning
and
determined
lunatic
he
escaped
from
the
asylum
where
i
am
at
present
assistant
doctor
after
all
but
murdering
me
he
has
been
seen
in
london
since
but
how
he
came
to
impersonate
the
unfortunate
gentleman
whom
you
locked
up
this
afternoon
i
can
not
before
they
broke
up
for
the
night
the
genuine
baron
released
from
confinement
and
soothed
by
the
humblest
apologies
and
a
heavy
supper
recounted
the
main
events
in
mr
beveridge
bunker
s
brief
career
in
town
on
his
exploits
in
st
egbert
s
he
felt
some
delicacy
in
touching
but
at
the
end
of
what
was
after
all
only
a
fragmentary
and
narrative
even
the
defrauded
trelawney
could
not
but
admit
that
whatever
the
departed
gentleman
s
failings
his
talents
at
least
were
worthy
of
a
better
cause
chapter
vii
the
party
at
brierley
park
had
gone
at
last
to
bed
the
baron
was
installed
in
his
late
usurper
s
room
and
from
the
the
hour
of
three
had
just
been
tolled
sympathy
and
sir
richard
s
cellar
had
greatly
mollified
the
baron
s
wrath
he
had
almost
begun
to
see
the
humorous
side
of
his
late
experience
as
a
rival
mr
bunker
was
extinct
and
with
an
easy
mind
and
a
placid
smile
he
had
fallen
asleep
some
two
hours
past
the
fire
burned
low
and
for
long
nothing
but
the
occasional
sigh
of
the
wind
in
the
trees
disturbed
the
silence
at
length
had
the
baron
been
awake
he
might
have
heard
the
stealthiest
of
footsteps
in
the
corridor
outside
then
they
stopped
his
door
was
gently
opened
and
first
a
head
and
then
a
whole
man
slipped
in
still
the
baron
slept
dreaming
peacefully
of
his
late
companion
they
were
driving
somewhere
in
a
hansom
mr
bunker
was
telling
one
of
his
most
amusing
stories
when
there
came
a
shock
the
hansom
seemed
to
turn
a
somersault
and
the
baron
awoke
at
first
he
thought
he
must
be
dreaming
still
the
electric
light
had
been
turned
on
and
the
room
was
bright
as
day
but
more
bewildering
yet
mr
bunker
was
seated
on
his
bed
gazing
at
him
with
an
expression
of
thoughtful
amusement
well
baron
he
said
i
trust
you
are
comfortable
in
these
excellent
the
baron
half
awake
and
wholly
astonished
was
unable
to
collect
his
ideas
in
time
to
make
any
reply
but
remember
continued
mr
bunker
you
have
a
reputation
to
live
up
to
i
have
set
the
standard
high
for
bavarian
the
indignant
baron
at
last
recovered
his
wits
if
you
do
not
go
away
he
said
raising
himself
on
his
elbows
i
shall
raise
ze
house
upon
you
have
you
forgotten
that
you
are
talking
to
a
dangerous
lunatic
who
probably
never
stirs
without
his
razor
the
baron
looked
at
him
and
turned
a
little
pale
he
made
no
further
movement
but
answered
stoutly
enough
vat
do
you
vant
in
the
first
place
i
want
my
brush
and
comb
a
few
clothes
and
my
events
happened
rather
more
quickly
this
evening
than
i
had
take
i
should
also
like
continued
mr
bunker
unmoved
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
i
think
i
owe
you
some
an
apology
or
i
m
afraid
it
s
my
last
zay
it
of
course
i
understand
that
you
make
no
hostile
demonstration
till
i
am
finished
a
hunted
man
must
take
precautions
you
i
vill
let
you
thanks
mr
bunker
folded
his
arms
leaned
his
back
against
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
began
in
his
way
i
have
amused
you
baron
now
and
then
you
must
admit
the
baron
made
no
reply
that
i
place
to
my
credit
and
i
think
few
debts
are
better
worth
repaying
on
the
other
hand
i
confess
i
have
subsisted
for
some
time
entirely
on
your
kindness
i
m
afraid
that
alone
counterbalances
the
debt
and
when
it
comes
to
my
being
the
means
of
your
taking
a
bath
in
mixed
company
and
spending
an
evening
in
a
locked
room
there
s
no
doubt
the
balance
is
greatly
on
your
i
zink
so
observed
the
baron
so
i
ll
tell
you
a
true
story
a
favour
with
which
i
haven
t
indulged
any
one
for
some
considerable
the
baron
coughed
but
said
nothing
my
biography
for
all
practical
purposes
mr
bunker
continued
begins
in
that
sequestered
retreat
clankwood
asylum
how
and
with
whom
i
came
there
i
haven
t
the
very
faintest
recollection
i
simply
woke
up
from
an
extraordinary
drowsiness
to
find
myself
recovering
from
a
sharp
attack
of
what
i
may
most
euphoniously
call
mental
excitement
the
original
cause
of
it
is
very
dim
in
my
mind
and
has
so
far
as
i
remember
nothing
to
do
with
the
rest
of
the
story
the
attack
was
very
short
i
believe
i
soon
came
to
something
more
or
less
like
myself
only
baron
the
singular
thing
is
that
it
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
new
better
or
worse
my
faulty
memory
does
not
permit
me
to
say
i
d
clean
forgotten
who
i
was
and
all
about
me
i
found
myself
called
francis
beveridge
but
that
wasn
t
my
old
name
i
ha
exclaimed
the
baron
growing
interested
despite
himself
and
the
most
remarkable
thing
of
all
is
that
up
till
this
day
i
haven
t
the
very
vaguest
notion
what
my
real
name
zo
said
the
baron
bot
vy
should
they
change
it
there
you
ve
laid
your
finger
on
the
mystery
baron
why
heaven
knows
i
wish
i
did
the
baron
looked
at
him
with
undisguised
interest
strange
he
said
thoughtfully
damnably
strange
i
found
myself
compelled
to
live
in
an
asylum
and
answer
to
a
new
name
and
really
don
t
you
know
under
the
circumstances
i
could
give
no
very
valid
reason
for
getting
out
i
seemed
to
have
blossomed
there
like
one
of
the
asylum
plants
i
couldn
t
possibly
have
been
more
identified
with
the
place
besides
i
m
free
to
confess
that
for
some
time
my
reason
taking
it
all
in
all
wasn
t
particularly
valid
on
any
point
by
george
i
had
a
funny
time
ha
ha
ha
his
mirth
was
so
infectious
that
the
baron
raised
his
voice
in
a
hearty
ha
ha
and
then
stopped
abruptly
and
said
cautiously
haf
a
care
bonker
zey
may
hear
however
baron
mr
bunker
continued
out
i
was
determined
to
get
and
out
i
came
in
the
manner
of
which
perhaps
my
friend
escott
has
already
informed
the
baron
grinned
and
nodded
i
came
up
to
town
and
on
my
very
first
evening
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
the
baron
rudolph
von
perhaps
you
may
remember
in
my
own
defence
baron
i
may
fairly
plead
that
since
i
could
remember
nothing
about
my
past
career
i
was
entitled
to
supply
the
details
from
my
imagination
after
all
i
have
no
proof
that
some
of
my
stories
may
not
have
been
correct
i
used
this
privilege
freely
in
clankwood
and
in
a
word
since
i
couldn
t
tell
the
truth
if
i
wanted
to
i
quenched
the
you
hombog
said
the
baron
not
without
a
note
of
admiration
i
was
and
i
gloried
in
it
baron
if
you
ever
want
to
know
how
ample
a
thing
life
can
be
become
a
certified
lunatic
you
are
quite
irresponsible
for
your
debts
your
crimes
and
not
least
your
words
it
certainly
enlarges
one
s
horizon
all
this
time
i
may
say
i
was
racking
my
by
the
way
have
been
steadily
growing
saner
in
other
some
recollections
of
my
previous
whereabouts
my
career
if
i
had
any
and
above
all
of
my
can
you
remember
nozing
i
can
remember
a
large
country
house
which
i
think
belonged
to
me
but
in
what
part
of
the
country
it
stands
i
haven
t
the
slightest
recollection
i
can
t
remember
any
family
and
as
no
one
has
inquired
for
me
i
don
t
suppose
i
had
any
many
festive
amusing
and
remember
distinctly
and
many
faces
but
there
s
nothing
to
piece
them
together
with
can
you
recall
one
or
two
incidents
in
town
when
people
spoke
to
me
or
bowed
to
me
yes
vell
i
vondered
i
suppose
they
knew
me
in
a
general
sort
of
way
i
knew
them
but
when
a
man
doesn
t
know
his
own
name
and
will
probably
be
replaced
in
an
asylum
if
he
s
identified
there
isn
t
much
encouragement
for
greeting
old
friends
and
do
you
remember
my
search
for
a
name
in
the
hotel
at
st
egbert
s
is
it
was
for
my
own
i
was
you
found
it
not
no
the
worst
of
it
is
i
can
t
even
remember
what
letter
it
began
with
sometimes
i
think
it
was
m
or
perhaps
n
and
sometimes
i
m
almost
sure
it
was
it
will
come
to
me
some
day
no
doubt
baron
but
till
it
does
i
shall
have
to
wander
about
a
nameless
man
looking
for
it
and
after
all
i
am
not
without
the
consolations
of
a
certain
useful
workaday
kind
of
he
rose
from
the
bed
and
smiled
humorously
at
his
friend
and
now
baron
he
said
it
only
remains
to
offer
you
such
thanks
and
apologies
as
a
lunatic
may
and
then
clear
out
before
the
cock
crows
these
are
my
brushes
i
there
was
still
something
on
the
baron
s
mind
he
lay
for
a
moment
watching
mr
bunker
collect
a
few
odds
and
ends
and
put
them
rapidly
into
a
small
bag
and
then
blurted
out
suddenly
ze
lady
you
loff
her
by
jove
exclaimed
mr
bunker
i
d
forgotten
all
about
her
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
i
once
met
her
before
when
she
showed
sympathy
i
may
an
unfortunate
gentleman
in
clankwood
that
s
you
do
not
loff
her
persisted
the
baron
i
my
dear
chap
no
you
are
most
welcome
to
the
does
she
not
loff
you
on
my
honour
no
i
told
her
a
few
early
reminiscences
she
happened
to
discover
they
were
not
what
is
generally
known
as
true
and
took
so
absurd
a
view
of
the
case
that
i
doubt
whether
she
would
speak
to
me
again
if
she
met
me
in
fact
baron
if
i
read
the
omens
i
ve
had
some
only
need
courage
and
a
the
bed
creaked
there
was
a
volcanic
upheaval
of
the
clothes
as
the
baron
sprang
out
on
to

sport
and
luck
in

my
frient
said
the
baron
squeezing
his
hand
his
friend
was
half
out
of
the
door
when
he
turned
and
said
with
an
intonation
quite
foreign
either
to
beveridge
or
bunker
and
yet
which
came
very
pleasantly
i
forgot
to
warn
you
of
one
thing
when
i
advised
you
to
try
the
of
certified
are
not
likely
to
make
so
good
a
friend
as
i
he
shut
the
door
noiselessly
and
was
gone
the
baron
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
for
fully
five
minutes
looking
blankly
at
the
closed
door
then
with
a
sigh
he
turned
out
the
light
and
tumbled
into
bed
again
part
iv
chapter
i
the
dover
express
was
nearing
town
evening
had
begun
to
draw
in
and
from
the
wayside
houses
people
saw
the
train
roar
by
like
a
huge
glowworm
but
they
could
hardly
guess
that
it
was
hurrying
two
real
actors
to
the
climax
of
a
real
comedy
from
the
opposite
sides
of
a
carriage
these
two
looked
cheerfully
at
one
another
the
channel
was
safely
behind
them
london
was
close
ahead
and
the
piston
of
the
engine
seemed
to
thump
a
triumphal
air
we
ve
done
it
twiddel
my
boy
said
the
one
thank
heaven
replied
the
other
myself
added
his
friend
yes
said
twiddel
you
played
your
part
uncommonly
well
it
was
the
deuce
of
a
fine
spree
sighed
welsh
the
deuce
assented
twiddel
i
m
only
sorry
it
s
all
over
welsh
went
on
gazing
regretfully
up
at
the
lamp
of
the
carriage
i
d
give
the
remains
of
my
character
and
my
chance
of
a
public
funeral
to
be
starting
again
from
paris
by
the
morning
train
twiddel
laughed
with
the
same
head
you
had
that
morning
yes
by
george
even
with
the
same
mile
of
dusty
gullet
it
s
all
over
now
said
twiddel
philosophically
and
yet
rather
at
least
the
amusing
part
of
all
the
fun
my
boy
all
the
fun
all
the
dinners
and
the
drinks
and
the
touching
of
hats
to
the
aristocratic
travellers
and
the
girls
that
sighed
and
the
bowing
and
scraping
do
you
remember
the
sporting
baronet
who
knew
my
uncle
now
i
m
plain
robert
welsh
whose
uncles
as
far
as
i
am
aware
don
t
know
a
baronet
among
he
smiled
a
little
sardonically
and
the
baron
at
fogelschloss
said
twiddel
who
insisted
on
learning
my
pedigree
back
to
alfred
the
great
gad
i
gave
it
him
though
and
i
doubt
whether
the
real
essington
could
have
done
as
much
i
d
rather
surprise
some
of
these
noblemen
if
i
turned
up
again
in
my
true
character
thank
the
lord
we
re
not
likely
to
meet
them
again
exclaimed
the
doctor
devoutly
no
said
welsh
here
endeth
the
second
his
friend
who
had
been
well
brought
up
looked
a
trifle
uncomfortable
at
this
quotation
i
say
he
remarked
a
few
minutes
later
we
haven
t
finished
yet
we
ve
got
to
get
the
man
out
again
and
hand
him
back
to
his
cured
said
welsh
with
a
laugh
i
wonder
how
he
is
we
ll
soon
they
fell
silent
again
while
the
train
hurried
nearer
and
nearer
london
town
welsh
seemed
to
be
musing
on
some
nice
point
it
might
be
of
conscience
it
might
also
conceivably
be
of
a
more
practical
texture
at
last
he
said
there
s
just
one
thing
old
man
what
about
the
fee
i
ll
get
a
cheque
for
it
i
suppose
his
friend
replied
with
an
almost
excessive
air
of
mastery
over
the
problem
ha
ha
laughed
welsh
you
know
what
i
mean
it
s
a
delicate
question
and
all
that
but
hang
it
it
s
got
to
be
what
has
the
division
of
the
twiddel
looked
dignified
i
ll
see
you
get
your
share
old
man
he
answered
easily
but
what
share
you
suggested
i
out
of
i
ve
done
all
the
deceiving
and
told
all
the
lies
come
old
man
well
what
do
you
want
do
you
remember
a
certain
crisis
when
we
d
made
a
you
d
made
a
slip
had
made
a
slip
and
you
wanted
to
chuck
the
game
and
bolt
do
you
remember
also
the
terms
i
proposed
when
i
offered
to
beard
the
local
god
almighty
in
his
lair
and
explain
it
all
away
and
how
he
became
our
bosom
pal
and
we
were
saved
well
to
me
to
you
said
welsh
decisively
rot
old
man
i
ll
share
fairly
if
you
insist
apiece
will
that
do
welsh
said
nothing
but
his
face
was
no
longer
the
countenance
of
the
jovial
adventurer
it
will
have
to
i
suppose
he
replied
at
length
it
was
with
this
little
cloud
on
the
horizon
that
they
saw
the
lights
of
london
twinkle
through
the
windows
and
were
carried
into
the
clamour
of
the
platforms
they
both
drove
first
to
twiddel
s
rooms
and
as
they
looked
out
once
more
on
the
life
and
lights
and
traffic
of
the
streets
their
faces
cleared
again
we
ll
have
a
merry
evening
cried
welsh
a
little
supper
suggested
twiddel
a
et
cetera
added
welsh
with
a
laugh
the
doctor
had
written
of
their
coming
and
they
found
a
fire
in
the
back
room
and
the
table
laid
ah
cried
welsh
this
looks
devilish
a
letter
for
me
said
twiddel
from
billson
i
he
read
it
and
threw
it
to
his
friend
remarking
i
call
this
rather
cool
of
welsh
dear
george
am
just
off
for
three
weeks
holiday
sorry
for
leaving
your
practice
but
i
think
it
can
look
after
itself
till
you
return
you
have
only
had
two
patients
and
one
fee
between
them
the
second
man
vanished
mysteriously
i
shall
tell
you
about
it
when
i
come
back
he
boned
a
bill
too
i
fancy
but
the
story
will
keep
i
am
looking
forward
to
hearing
the
true
tale
of
your
adventures
good
luck
to
ever
thomas
boned
a
bill
exclaimed
welsh
what
bill
i
wonder
something
that
came
when
i
was
away
i
suppose
hang
it
i
think
billson
might
have
looked
after
things
better
it
sounds
queer
said
welsh
reflectively
i
wonder
what
it
was
confound
billson
he
might
have
told
me
observed
the
doctor
but
i
say
you
know
we
have
something
more
practical
to
see
getting
the
man
out
again
well
let
s
have
a
little
grub
twiddel
rang
the
bell
and
the
frowsy
little
maid
entered
carrying
a
letter
on
a
tray
dinner
said
he
please
sir
began
the
maid
holding
out
the
tray
this
come
for
you
near
a
month
agow
but
missis
she
bin
and
forgot
to
send
it
hafter
confound
her
said
twiddel
taking
the
letter
he
looked
at
the
envelope
and
remarked
with
a
little
start
of
nervous
excitement
from
dr
news
of
mr
beveridge
laughed
welsh
the
doctor
read
the
first
few
lines
and
then
as
if
he
had
got
an
electric
shock
the
letter
fell
from
his
hand
and
an
expression
of
the
most
utter
and
lively
consternation
came
over
his
face
heavens
he
ejaculated
it
s
all
what
s
up
cried
welsh
snatching
at
the
letter
he
s
run
away
welsh
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
some
astonishment
and
then
burst
out
laughing
what
a
joke
he
cried
i
don
t
see
anything
to
make
a
fuss
about
we
re
jolly
well
rid
of
the
fee
i
won
t
get
a
penny
till
i
bring
him
back
and
the
whole
thing
will
be
found
out
as
the
full
meaning
of
this
predicament
burst
upon
welsh
his
face
underwent
a
change
by
no
means
pleasant
to
watch
for
a
full
minute
he
swore
and
then
an
ominous
silence
fell
upon
the
room
twiddel
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
let
me
see
the
letter
he
said
i
haven
t
finished
welsh
read
it
dear
twiddel
regret
to
inform
you
that
the
patient
francis
beveridge
whom
you
placed
under
my
care
has
escaped
from
clankwood
we
have
made
every
inquiry
consistent
with
strict
privacy
but
unfortunately
have
not
yet
been
able
to
lay
our
hands
upon
him
we
only
know
that
he
left
ashditch
junction
in
the
london
express
and
was
seen
walking
out
of
st
euston
s
cross
how
he
has
been
able
to
maintain
himself
in
concealment
without
money
or
clothes
i
am
unable
to
imagine
as
no
inquiries
have
been
made
for
him
by
his
cousin
mr
welsh
or
any
other
of
his
friends
or
relatives
i
am
writing
to
you
that
you
may
inform
them
and
i
hope
that
this
letter
may
follow
you
abroad
without
delay
i
may
add
that
the
circumstances
of
his
escape
showed
most
unusual
cunning
and
could
not
possibly
have
been
guarded
against
trusting
that
you
are
having
a
pleasant
holiday
i
am
yours
very
truly
adolphus
the
two
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
for
a
minute
and
then
welsh
said
fiercely
you
must
catch
him
again
twiddel
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
have
all
my
risk
and
trouble
for
nothing
must
catch
him
do
you
suppose
let
him
loose
you
must
catch
him
all
the
i
shan
t
bother
my
head
about
him
answered
twiddel
with
the
recklessness
of
despair
you
won
t
you
want
to
have
the
story
known
i
suppose
i
don
t
care
if
it
welsh
looked
at
him
for
a
minute
then
he
jumped
up
and
exclaimed
you
need
a
drink
old
man
let
s
hurry
up
that
with
the
first
course
their
countenances
cleared
a
little
with
the
second
they
were
almost
composed
by
the
end
of
dinner
they
had
started
hopefully
again
it
s
any
odds
on
the
man
s
still
being
in
town
said
welsh
he
had
no
money
or
clothes
and
evidently
he
hasn
t
gone
to
any
of
his
friends
or
the
whole
story
would
have
been
out
now
there
is
nowhere
where
a
man
can
lie
low
so
well
especially
if
he
is
hard
up
as
london
i
can
answer
from
experience
he
is
hardly
likely
to
be
in
the
west
end
or
the
best
class
of
suburbs
so
we
ve
something
to
go
upon
at
once
we
must
go
to
a
private
inquiry
office
and
put
men
on
his
track
and
then
we
must
take
the
town
in
beats
ourselves
so
much
is
clear
do
you
see
and
hadn
t
we
better
find
out
whether
anything
more
is
known
at
clankwood
suggested
twiddel
dr
congleton
wrote
a
month
ago
perhaps
they
have
caught
him
by
this
hardly
likely
i
m
afraid
he
d
have
written
to
you
if
they
had
still
we
can
but
but
i
say
the
doctor
suddenly
exclaimed
people
may
find
out
that
i
m
back
without
welsh
was
equal
to
the
emergency
you
must
leave
again
at
once
he
said
decisively
rising
from
the
table
and
there
s
no
good
wasting
time
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
bewildered
doctor
who
had
not
yet
assimilated
the
criminal
point
of
view
we
ll
put
our
luggage
straight
on
to
a
cab
drive
off
to
other
know
a
cheap
place
that
will
if
by
any
chance
inquiries
are
made
people
must
be
told
that
you
are
still
abroad
nobody
must
hear
of
your
coming
home
is
began
twiddel
dubiously
is
it
what
snapped
his
friend
is
it
worth
it
is
not
to
speak
of
two
reputations
worth
it
come
on
the
unfortunate
doctor
sighed
and
rose
too
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
the
nefarious
acquisition
of
fees
might
have
drawbacks
after
all
chapter
ii
the
chronicle
must
now
go
back
a
few
days
and
follow
another
i
must
either
be
a
clergyman
or
a
policeman
mr
bunker
reflected
in
the
corner
of
his
carriage
they
seem
to
me
to
be
on
the
whole
the
two
least
molested
professions
each
certainly
has
a
livery
which
if
its
occupier
is
ordinarily
judicious
ought
to
serve
as
a
certificate
of
sanity
to
me
all
policemen
are
precisely
alike
but
i
daresay
they
know
them
apart
in
the
force
and
as
all
the
beats
and
crossings
are
presumably
taken
already
i
might
excite
suspicion
by
my
mere
superfluity
besides
a
theatrical
costumier
s
uniform
would
possibly
lack
some
ridiculous
but
essential
he
lit
another
cigar
and
looked
humorously
out
of
the
window
i
shall
take
orders
an
amateur
theatrical
clergyman
s
costume
will
be
more
comfortable
and
probably
less
erroneous
they
allow
them
some
latitude
i
believe
and
i
don
t
suppose
there
are
any
visible
ordination
scars
whose
absence
would
give
me
away
i
shall
certainly
study
the
first
reverend
brother
i
meet
to
thus
wisely
ruminating
he
arrived
in
london
at
a
very
early
hour
on
a
chilly
morning
and
drove
straight
to
a
small
hotel
near
king
s
cross
where
the
landlord
was
much
gratified
at
receiving
so
respectable
a
guest
as
the
rev
alexander
butler
i
must
begin
with
a
said
mr
bunker
to
himself
i
think
it
s
it
is
true
the
reverend
gentleman
was
in
evening
clothes
while
his
hat
and
coat
had
a
singularly
secular
not
to
say
fashionable
appearance
but
as
he
mentioned
casually
in
the
course
of
some
extremely
affable
remarks
he
had
been
dining
in
a
country
house
and
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
changing
before
he
left
after
breakfasting
he
dressed
himself
in
an
equally
secular
suit
of
tweeds
and
went
out
he
mentioned
incidentally
to
call
at
his
tailor
s
for
his
professional
habit
which
he
seemed
surprised
to
learn
had
not
yet
been
forwarded
to
the
hotel
a
visit
to
a
certain
firm
of
theatrical
costumiers
was
followed
by
his
reappearance
in
a
cab
accompanied
by
a
bulky
brown
paper
parcel
and
presently
he
emerged
from
his
room
attired
more
consistently
with
his
office
much
to
his
own
satisfaction
for
as
he
observed
i
can
not
say
i
approve
of
clergymen
masquerading
as
his
opinion
on
the
converse
circumstance
was
not
expressed
much
to
his
landlord
s
disappointment
he
informed
him
that
he
should
probably
leave
again
that
afternoon
and
then
he
went
out
for
a
walk
about
half
an
hour
later
he
was
once
more
in
the
street
where
not
so
very
long
ago
a
very
exciting
had
finished
he
strolled
slowly
past
dr
twiddel
s
house
the
blinds
of
the
front
room
were
down
at
that
hour
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
it
and
he
saw
nothing
at
all
to
arrest
his
attention
then
he
looked
down
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
to
his
great
satisfaction
spied
a
card
with
the
legend
apartments
to
let
in
one
of
the
windows
of
a
house
immediately
opposite
he
rang
the
bell
and
in
a
moment
a
rotund
and
loquacious
landlady
appeared
yes
the
was
to
let
would
the
reverend
gentleman
come
up
and
see
it
mr
bunker
went
up
and
approved
they
readily
agreed
upon
terms
and
the
landlady
charmed
with
her
new
lodger
s
appearance
and
manners
no
less
than
with
the
respectability
of
his
profession
proceeded
to
descant
at
some
length
on
the
quiet
comfort
and
numerous
other
advantages
of
the
apartments
just
the
very
plice
you
wants
sir
we
ave
ad
clerical
gentlemen
ere
before
sir
in
fact
there
s
one
ere
now

floor
may
know
of
im
sir
reverend
mr
john
duggs
a
very
pleasant
gentleman
you
ll
find
him
sir
i
ll
tell
im
you
re
ere
sir
e
d
be
sure
to
like
to
meet
another
gentleman
of
the
syme
cloth
has
they
somehow
or
other
the
rev
mr
butler
failed
to
display
the
hearty
pleasure
at
this
announcement
that
the
worthy
mrs
gabbon
had
naturally
expected
aloud
he
merely
said
indeed
politely
but
with
no
unusual
interest
within
himself
he
reflected
the
deuce
take
mr
john
duggs
however
i
want
the
rooms
and
a
man
must
risk
as
a
precautionary
measure
he
visited
a
bookseller
on
his
way
back
and
purchased
a
small
assortment
of
the
works
on
theology
they
kept
in
stock
and
these
with
his
slender
luggage
he
brought
round
to
mrs
gabbon
s
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
he
looked
carefully
out
of
his
window
but
the
doctor
s
blinds
were
still
down
and
he
saw
no
one
coming
or
going
about
the
house
so
he
began
his
inquiries
by
calling
up
his
landlady
i
have
been
troubled
with
lumbago
mrs
gabbon
he
began
dearie
me
sir
said
mrs
gabbon
i
m
sorry
to
ear
that
you
that
looks
so
ealthy
too
well
one
never
knows
what
s
be
ind
a
appy
hexterior
does
one
sir
no
mrs
gabbon
replied
mr
bunker
solemnly
one
never
knows
what
even
a
clergyman
s
coat
that
s
very
true
sir
in
the
midst
of
life
we
are
lumbago
interposed
mr
bunker
mrs
gabbon
looked
a
trifle
startled
well
he
continued
with
the
same
gravity
i
may
unfortunately
have
occasion
to
consult
a
there
s
dr
smith
interrupted
mrs
gabbon
her
equanimity
quite
restored
by
his
ecclesiastical
tone
and
the
mention
of
ailments
e
attended
my
poor
dear
usband
hall
through
his
last
illness
an
huncommon
clever
doctor
sir
as
i
ought
to
know
sir
bein
no
doubt
an
excellent
man
mrs
gabbon
but
i
should
like
to
know
of
one
as
near
at
hand
as
possible
now
i
see
the
name
of
a
dr
i
wouldn
t
recommend
im
sir
said
mrs
gabbon
pursing
her
mouth
indeed
why
not
e
attended
mrs
brown
s
sir
bein
the
lady
as
has
the
ouse
next
door
what
he
give
didn
t
do
no
good
mrs
brown
tell
me
still
in
an
besides
which
he
ain
t
at
ome
where
has
he
gone
abroad
they
do
say
sir
though
i
don
t
rightly
know
much
about
has
he
been
away
long
mrs
gabbon
considered
it
must
ave
bin
before
the
middle
of
november
he
went
ha
exclaimed
mr
bunker
keenly
though
apparently
more
to
himself
than
his
landlady
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
the
middle
of
november
you
say
that
s
a
long
holiday
for
a
doctor
to
e
avn
t
no
practice
to
speak
of
as
i
knows
of
what
sort
of
a
man
is
or
old
by
my
opinion
sir
e
s
too
young
i
don
t
old
by
them
young
doctors
now
dr
smith
dr
twiddel
is
quite
a
young
man
then
what
i
d
call
little
better
than
a
boy
sir
they
tell
me
they
lets
em
loose
very
young
about
say
e
might
be
that
sir
but
i
don
t
know
much
about
im
sir
now
dr
smith
sir
e
s
in
fact
at
this
point
mrs
gabbon
showed
such
a
tendency
to
turn
the
conversation
back
to
the
merits
of
dr
smith
and
the
precise
nature
of
mr
bunker
s
ailment
that
her
lodger
in
despair
requested
her
to
bring
up
a
cup
of
tea
as
speedily
as
possible
before
the
middle
of
november
he
said
to
himself
it
is
certainly
a
curious
to
a
gentleman
of
mr
bunker
s
sociable
habits
and
active
mind
the
prospect
of
sitting
day
by
day
in
the
company
of
his
theological
treatises
and
talkative
landlady
and
watching
an
apparently
uninhabited
house
seemed
at
first
sight
even
less
entertaining
than
a
return
to
clankwood
but
as
he
said
of
himself
he
possessed
a
kind
of
easy
workaday
philosophy
and
besides
that
an
apparently
irresistible
attraction
for
the
incidents
of
life
he
had
barely
finished
his
cup
of
tea
and
was
sitting
over
the
fire
smoking
one
of
the
baron
s
cigars
and
looking
through
one
of
the
few
books
he
had
brought
that
bore
no
relation
to
divinity
his
feet
high
upon
the
side
of
the
mantelpiece
his
costume
perhaps
a
little
more
unbuttoned
than
the
strictest
propriety
might
approve
and
a
stiff
glass
of
at
his
elbow
when
there
came
a
rap
at
his
door
in
response
to
his
come
in
a
gentleman
dressed
in
clerical
attire
entered
he
had
a
broad
bearded
face
a
dull
eye
and
an
indescribably
average
aspect
the
devil
mr
john
duggs
himself
thought
mr
bunker
hastily
adopting
a
more
conventional
attitude
and
feeling
for
his
butler
i
believe
said
the
stranger
with
an
apologetic
air
the
same
replied
mr
bunker
smiling
affably
i
continued
his
visitor
advancing
with
more
confidence
am
mr
duggs
i
am
dwelling
at
present
in
the
apartment
immediately
above
you
and
hearing
of
the
arrival
of
a
through
my
worthy
friend
mrs
gabbon
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
calling
she
gave
me
to
understand
that
you
were
not
undesirous
of
making
my
acquaintance
mr
the
deuce
she
did
thought
mr
butler
aloud
he
answered
most
politely
i
am
honoured
mr
duggs
won
t
you
sit
down
first
casting
a
wary
eye
upon
a
chair
mr
duggs
seated
himself
carefully
on
the
edge
of
it
it
is
quite
evident
thought
mr
bunker
that
he
has
spotted
something
wrong
i
believe
a
bobby
would
have
been
safer
after
he
assumed
the
longest
face
he
could
draw
and
remarked
sententiously
the
weather
has
been
unpleasantly
cold
of
late
mr
he
flattered
himself
that
his
guest
seemed
instantly
more
at
his
ease
certainly
he
replied
with
as
much
cordiality
as
a
man
with
such
a
dull
eye
could
be
supposed
to
display
it
has
mr
butler
in
fact
i
have
suffered
from
a
chill
for
some
weeks
ahem
have
something
to
drink
suggested
mr
bunker
sympathetically
i
m
trying
a
little
whisky
myself
as
a
cure
for
am
sorry
i
do
not
touch
i
on
the
contrary
am
glad
to
hear
it
too
few
of
our
clergymen
nowadays
support
the
cause
of
temperance
by
mr
bunker
felt
a
little
natural
pride
in
this
happily
expressed
sentiment
but
his
visitor
merely
turned
his
cold
eye
on
the
whisky
bottle
and
breathed
heavily
confound
him
he
thought
i
ll
give
him
something
to
snort
at
if
he
is
going
to
conduct
himself
like
have
a
cigar
he
asked
aloud
mr
duggs
seemed
to
regard
the
a
little
less
unkindly
than
the
whisky
bottle
but
after
a
careful
look
at
it
he
replied
i
am
afraid
they
seem
a
little
too
strong
for
me
i
am
a
light
smoker
mr
really
smiled
mr
bunker
so
many
virtues
in
one
room
reminds
me
of
the
virgins
of
i
beg
your
pardon
the
what
asked
mr
duggs
with
a
startled
stare
mr
bunker
suspected
that
he
had
made
a
slip
in
his
biblical
reminiscences
but
he
continued
to
smile
imperturbably
and
inquired
with
a
perfect
air
of
surprise
haven
t
you
read
the
novel
i
referred
to
mr
duggs
appeared
a
little
relieved
but
he
answered
blankly
enough
not
what
is
the
book
you
refer
to
oh
don
t
you
know
to
tell
the
truth
i
forget
the
title
it
s
by
a
somewhat
lady
writer
of
religious
fiction
a
name
escapes
me
at
this
in
fact
as
mr
bunker
had
no
idea
how
long
his
friend
might
be
dwelling
in
the
apartment
immediately
above
him
he
thought
it
more
prudent
to
make
no
statement
that
could
possibly
be
checked
i
am
no
great
admirer
of
religious
fiction
of
any
kind
replied
mr
duggs
particularly
that
written
by
emotional
no
said
mr
bunker
pleasantly
i
should
imagine
your
own
doctrines
were
not
apt
to
err
on
the
sentimental
i
am
not
aware
that
i
have
said
anything
to
you
about
as
you
call
them
mr
still
don
t
you
think
one
can
generally
tell
a
man
s
creed
from
his
coat
and
his
sympathies
from
the
way
he
cocks
his
hat
i
think
replied
mr
duggs
that
our
ideas
of
our
vocation
are
somewhat
mine
is
i
admit
said
mr
bunker
who
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
strain
of
playing
his
part
was
really
too
great
and
was
now
being
happily
carried
along
by
his
tongue
mr
duggs
for
a
moment
was
evidently
disposed
to
give
battle
but
thinking
better
of
it
he
contented
himself
with
frowning
at
his
younger
opponent
and
abruptly
changed
the
subject
may
i
ask
what
position
you
hold
in
the
church
mr
butler
why
began
mr
bunker
lightly
it
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
say
a
clergyman
of
course
when
he
suddenly
recollected
that
he
might
be
anything
from
the
rank
of
curate
up
to
the
people
who
wear
gaiters
and
who
these
were
precisely
he
didn
t
know
an
ingenious
solution
suggested
itself
he
replied
with
a
preliminary
inquiry
have
you
ever
been
in
the
east
mr
duggs
i
regret
to
say
i
have
not
hitherto
had
the
thank
the
lord
for
that
thought
mr
bunker
i
have
been
a
missionary
he
said
quietly
and
looked
dreamily
into
the
fire
it
was
a
happy
move
mr
duggs
was
visibly
impressed
ah
he
said
indeed
i
am
much
interested
to
learn
this
mr
butler
me
perhaps
a
somewhat
different
view
of
where
did
your
work
lie
china
replied
mr
bunker
thinking
it
best
to
keep
as
far
abroad
as
possible
ha
exclaimed
mr
duggs
this
is
really
extremely
fortunate
i
am
at
present
mr
butler
studying
the
religions
and
customs
of
china
at
the
british
museum
with
a
view
to
going
out
there
myself
very
shortly
i
already
feel
i
know
almost
as
much
about
that
most
interesting
country
as
if
i
had
lived
there
i
should
like
to
talk
with
you
at
some
length
on
the
mr
bunker
saw
that
it
was
time
to
put
an
end
to
this
conversation
at
whatever
minor
risk
of
perturbing
his
visitor
he
had
been
a
little
alarmed
too
by
noticing
that
mr
duggs
dull
eye
had
wandered
frequently
to
his
theological
library
which
with
his
usual
foresight
he
had
strewn
conspicuously
on
the
table
and
that
any
expression
it
had
was
rather
of
suspicious
curiosity
than
gratification
i
should
like
to
hear
some
of
your
experiences
mr
duggs
continued
in
what
province
did
you
work
in
hung
hang
ho
replied
mr
bunker
his
visitor
looked
puzzled
but
he
continued
boldly
my
experiences
were
somewhat
unpleasant
i
became
engaged
to
a
mandarin
s
charming
girl
i
was
suspected
however
of
abetting
an
illicit
traffic
in
chinese
lanterns
my
companions
were
manicured
alive
and
i
only
made
my
escape
in
a
pagoda
or
a
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
notice
the
imminent
peril
of
my
life
don
t
go
to
china
mr
mr
duggs
rose
young
man
he
said
sternly
put
away
that
fatal
bottle
i
can
only
suppose
that
it
is
under
the
influence
of
drink
that
you
have
ventured
to
tell
me
such
an
irreverent
and
impossible
sir
began
mr
bunker
warmly
he
thought
that
an
outburst
of
indignation
would
probably
be
the
safest
way
of
concluding
the
interview
he
stopped
abruptly
and
listened
all
the
time
his
ears
had
been
alive
to
anything
going
on
outside
and
now
he
heard
a
cab
rattle
up
and
stop
close
by
it
might
be
at
dr
twiddel
s
he
thought
and
turning
from
his
visitor
he
sprang
to
the
window
remarking
distantly
i
hear
a
cab
it
is
possibly
a
friend
i
am
expecting
mr
duggs
stepped
to
the
other
window
it
was
only
however
a
hansom
at
the
door
of
the
next
house
out
of
which
a
very
young
lady
was
stepping
aha
said
mr
bunker
quite
forgetting
the
indignant
he
had
begun
to
play
rather
nice
is
this
your
friend
mr
duggs
mr
duggs
gave
him
one
look
of
his
dull
eyes
and
walked
straight
for
the
door
as
he
went
out
he
merely
remarked
our
acquaintance
has
been
brief
mr
butler
but
it
has
been
quite
quite
thought
mr
bunker
chapter
iii
that
was
mr
bunker
s
first
and
last
meeting
with
the
rev
john
duggs
and
he
took
no
small
credit
to
himself
for
having
so
effectually
incensed
his
neighbour
without
at
the
same
time
bringing
suspicion
on
anything
more
pertinent
than
his
sobriety
and
yet
sometimes
in
the
course
of
the
next
three
days
he
would
have
been
thankful
to
see
him
again
if
only
to
have
another
the
time
passed
most
wearily
the
blinds
were
never
raised
no
cabs
stopped
before
the
doctor
s
door
nobody
except
the
little
servant
ever
moved
about
the
house
he
could
think
of
no
plan
better
than
waiting
and
so
he
waited
showing
himself
seldom
in
the
streets
and
even
sitting
behind
the
curtain
while
he
watched
at
the
window
after
writing
at
some
length
to
the
baron
he
had
no
further
correspondence
that
he
could
distract
himself
with
he
was
even
forced
once
or
twice
to
dip
into
the
theological
works
mrs
gabbon
had
evidently
eard
sommat
from
mr
duggs
and
treated
him
to
little
of
her
society
the
boredom
became
so
excessive
that
he
decided
he
must
make
a
move
soon
however
rash
it
was
the
only
active
step
he
took
and
indeed
the
only
step
he
saw
his
way
to
take
was
a
call
on
dr
twiddel
s
but
luck
seemed
to
run
dead
against
him
dr
billson
had
departed
on
his
holiday
he
was
informed
and
would
not
return
for
three
weeks
so
mr
bunker
was
driven
back
to
his
window
and
the
baron
s
cigars
it
was
the
evening
of
his
fourth
day
in
mrs
gabbon
s
rooms
he
had
finished
a
modest
dinner
and
was
dealing
himself
hands
at
piquet
with
an
old
pack
of
cards
when
he
heard
the
rattle
of
a
cab
coming
up
the
street
the
usual
faint
flicker
of
hope
rose
the
cab
stopped
below
him
the
flicker
burned
brighter
and
in
an
instant
he
was
at
the
window
he
opened
the
slats
of
the
blind
and
the
flicker
was
aflame
before
the
doctor
s
house
a
cab
was
standing
laden
with
luggage
and
two
men
were
going
up
the
steps
he
watched
the
luggage
being
taken
in
and
the
cab
drive
away
and
then
he
turned
radiantly
back
to
the
fire
the
curtain
is
up
he
said
to
himself
what
s
the
first
act
to
be
presently
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
for
a
stroll
he
walked
slowly
past
the
doctor
s
house
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
or
heard
remembering
the
room
at
the
back
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
no
chink
of
light
about
the
front
windows
and
thinking
it
better
not
to
run
the
risk
of
being
seen
lingering
there
he
walked
on
he
was
in
such
good
spirits
and
had
been
cooped
up
so
continually
for
the
last
few
days
that
he
went
on
and
on
and
it
was
not
till
about
a
couple
of
hours
had
passed
that
he
approached
his
rooms
again
as
he
came
down
the
street
he
was
surprised
to
see
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
that
another
was
standing
before
the
doctor
s
house
also
laden
with
luggage
two
men
jumped
in
one
after
another
and
when
he
had
come
at
his
fastest
walk
within
twenty
yards
or
so
the
cabman
whipped
up
and
drove
rapidly
away
luggage
and
men
and
all
he
looked
up
and
down
for
a
hansom
but
there
were
none
to
be
seen
for
a
few
yards
he
set
off
at
a
run
in
pursuit
and
then
finding
that
the
horse
was
being
driven
at
a
great
rate
and
remembering
the
paucity
of
stray
cabs
in
the
quiet
streets
and
roads
round
about
he
stopped
and
considered
the
question
after
all
he
reflected
it
may
not
have
been
dr
twiddel
who
drove
away
in
fact
if
it
was
he
who
arrived
in
the
first
cab
it
s
any
odds
against
it
pooh
it
can
t
be
still
it
s
a
curious
thing
if
two
cabs
loaded
with
luggage
came
to
the
house
in
the
same
evening
and
one
drove
away
without
with
his
spirits
a
little
damped
in
spite
of
his
philosophy
he
went
back
to
his
rooms
in
the
morning
the
blinds
were
still
down
and
the
house
looked
as
deserted
as
ever
he
waited
till
lunch
and
then
he
went
out
boldly
and
pulled
the
doctor
s
bell
the
same
little
maid
appeared
but
she
evidently
did
not
recognise
the
fashionable
patient
who
disappeared
so
mysteriously
in
the
clergyman
at
the
door
is
dr
twiddel
at
home
no
sir
he
ain
t
back
he
hasn
t
been
back
no
mr
bunker
looked
at
her
keenly
and
then
said
to
himself
she
is
he
thought
he
would
try
a
chance
shot
but
he
was
expected
home
last
night
i
the
maid
looked
a
little
staggered
he
ain
t
been
she
replied
i
happen
to
have
heard
that
he
called
here
he
hazarded
again
this
time
she
was
evidently
put
about
he
ain
t
been
i
knows
he
slipped
into
her
hand
think
again
he
said
in
his
most
winning
accents
the
poor
little
maid
was
obviously
in
a
dilemma
do
you
want
him
particular
sir
she
fidgeted
a
little
he
told
me
he
pursued
that
he
might
look
in
at
his
rooms
last
night
he
left
no
message
for
me
what
name
sir
mr
no
then
my
dear
said
mr
bunker
with
his
most
insinuating
smile
he
was
here
for
a
little
you
can
t
deny
at
the
maid
s
embarrassed
glance
down
his
long
coat
he
suddenly
realised
that
there
was
perhaps
a
distinction
between
lay
and
clerical
smiles
he
might
have
just
looked
in
sir
she
admitted
but
he
didn
t
want
it
known
no
quite
right
i
advised
him
not
to
and
you
did
very
well
not
to
tell
me
at
he
smiled
approvingly
and
made
a
pretence
of
turning
away
oh
by
the
way
he
added
stopping
as
if
struck
by
an
is
he
still
in
town
he
promised
to
leave
word
for
me
but
he
has
evidently
i
don
t
know
sir
e
didn
t
what
he
left
word
at
all
no
mr
bunker
held
out
another
it
s
truth
sir
said
the
maid
drawing
back
we
don
t
know
where
e
take
it
all
the
same
you
have
been
very
discreet
you
have
no
idea
the
maid
hesitated
i
ear
mr
welsh
say
something
about
lookin
for
rooms
she
allowed
in
london
i
expect
so
sir
but
e
didn
t
say
no
mr
welsh
is
the
friend
who
came
with
him
of
course
yes
thanks
said
mr
bunker
by
the
way
dr
twiddel
might
not
like
your
telling
this
even
to
a
friend
so
you
needn
t
say
i
called
i
ll
tell
him
myself
when
i
see
him
and
i
won
t
give
you
he
smiled
benignly
and
the
little
maid
thanked
him
quite
gratefully
evidently
he
thought
as
he
went
away
i
was
meant
for
something
in
the
detective
he
returned
to
his
rooms
to
meditate
and
the
longer
he
thought
the
more
puzzled
he
became
and
yet
the
more
convinced
that
he
had
taken
up
a
thread
that
must
lead
him
somewhere
as
for
my
plan
of
action
he
considered
i
see
nothing
better
for
it
than
staying
where
i
watching
this
mysterious
doctor
must
surely
steal
back
some
night
now
and
then
i
might
go
round
the
town
and
try
a
cast
in
the
likeliest
hang
me
though
i
forgot
i
was
a
that
night
he
had
a
welcome
distraction
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
from
the
baron
it
was
written
from
brierley
park
in
the
baron
s
best
pointed
german
hand
and
it
ran
my
dear
bunker
was
greatly
more
delighted
than
i
am
able
to
express
to
you
from
the
amusing
correspondence
you
addressed
me
how
glad
i
am
i
can
assure
you
that
you
are
still
in
safety
and
comfort
remember
my
dear
friend
to
call
for
me
when
need
arises
although
i
do
think
you
can
guard
yourself
as
well
as
most
alone
this
leaves
me
happy
and
healthful
and
in
utmost
prosperity
with
the
kind
sir
richard
and
his
charming
lady
you
english
certainly
know
well
how
to
cause
time
to
pass
with
mirth
about
instruction
i
say
less
they
have
talked
of
you
here
i
laugh
and
keep
my
tongue
when
they
wonder
who
he
is
and
whither
gone
away
now
that
anger
is
passed
and
they
see
i
myself
enjoy
the
joke
they
say
and
especially
do
the
ladies
you
humbug
bunker
how
charming
was
the
imitation
baron
you
can
indeed
win
the
hearts
if
wishful
so
the
lady
grillyer
and
her
unexpressable
daughter
i
have
often
seen
they
come
here
for
two
nights
i
did
suggest
it
to
lady
brierley
and
i
fear
she
did
suspect
the
condition
of
my
heart
but
she
charmingly
smiled
she
asked
them
and
they
come
the
countess
i
fear
does
not
now
love
you
much
my
friend
but
then
she
knows
not
the
truth
the
lady
alicia
is
strangely
silent
on
the
matter
of
mr
bunker
but
in
time
she
also
doubtless
will
forgive
at
this
mr
bunker
smiled
in
some
amusement
when
they
leave
brierley
i
also
shall
take
my
departure
on
the
following
day
that
is
in
three
days
therefore
write
hastily
bunker
and
name
the
place
and
hour
where
we
shall
meet
again
and
dine
festively
i
expect
a
most
reverent
clergyman
and
much
instructive
discourse
ah
humbug
always
rudolph
von
is
sometimes
more
kind
and
sometimes
so
distant
ah
i
know
not
what
to
surmise
but
or
the
next
my
fate
will
be
decided
give
me
of
your
prayers
my
reverent
friend
von
dear
old
baron
said
mr
bunker
well
i
ve
at
least
a
dinner
to
look
forward
chapter
iv
dr
twiddel
meanwhile
was
no
less
anxious
to
make
the
rev
alexander
butler
s
acquaintance
than
the
rev
alexander
butler
was
to
make
his
not
that
he
was
aware
of
that
gentleman
s
recent
change
of
identity
and
occupation
but
most
industrious
endeavors
to
find
a
certain
mr
beveridge
were
made
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
he
and
welsh
were
living
modestly
and
obscurely
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
pentonville
road
scouring
the
town
by
day
studying
a
map
and
laying
the
most
ingenious
plans
at
night
welsh
s
first
effort
as
soon
as
they
were
established
in
their
new
quarters
was
to
induce
his
friend
to
go
down
to
clankwood
and
make
further
inquiries
but
this
twiddel
absolutely
declined
to
do
my
dear
chap
he
answered
supposing
anything
were
found
out
or
even
suspected
what
am
i
to
say
old
congleton
knows
me
well
and
for
his
own
sake
doesn
t
want
to
make
a
fuss
but
if
he
really
spots
that
something
is
wrong
he
will
be
so
afraid
of
his
reputation
that
he
d
give
me
away
like
a
how
are
you
going
to
give
things
away
by
going
down
and
seeing
him
they
have
guessed
anything
i
ll
give
it
away
i
haven
t
your
cheek
you
know
and
tact
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
d
much
better
go
it
isn
t
my
you
seem
to
be
making
it
yours
besides
dr
congleton
thinks
it
is
you
passed
yourself
off
as
the
chap
s
cousin
and
it
is
quite
natural
for
you
to
go
and
welsh
pondered
the
point
hang
it
he
said
at
last
it
would
do
just
as
well
to
write
perhaps
it
s
safer
after
well
you
why
should
i
rather
than
you
because
you
re
his
welsh
considered
again
well
i
don
t
suppose
it
matters
much
i
ll
write
if
you
re
it
was
these
amiable
little
touches
in
his
friend
s
conversation
that
helped
to
make
twiddel
s
lot
at
this
time
so
pleasant
in
fact
the
doctor
was
learning
a
good
deal
about
human
nature
in
cloudy
weather
with
great
care
welsh
composed
a
polite
note
of
anxious
inquiry
and
by
return
of
post
received
the
following
reply
my
dear
sir
regret
to
inform
you
that
we
have
not
so
far
recovered
your
cousin
mr
beveridge
in
all
probability
however
this
can
not
be
long
delayed
now
as
he
was
seen
within
the
last
week
at
a
country
house
in
dampshire
and
is
known
to
have
fled
to
london
immediately
on
his
recognition
but
before
he
could
be
secured
he
was
then
clean
shaved
and
had
been
passing
under
the
name
of
francis
bunker
we
are
making
strict
inquiries
for
him
in
london
nobody
can
regret
the
unfortunate
circumstance
of
his
escape
more
than
i
and
in
justice
to
myself
and
my
institution
i
can
assure
you
that
it
was
only
through
the
most
unforeseen
and
remarkable
ingenuity
on
your
cousin
s
part
that
it
occurred
trusting
that
i
may
soon
be
able
to
inform
you
of
his
recovery
i
am
yours
very
truly
adolphus
congleton
their
ardour
was
if
possible
increased
by
dr
congleton
s
letter
mr
beveridge
was
almost
certainly
in
london
and
they
knew
now
that
they
must
look
for
a
man
two
private
inquiry
detectives
were
at
work
and
on
their
own
account
they
had
mapped
the
likeliest
parts
of
london
into
beats
visiting
every
bar
and
restaurant
in
turn
and
occasionally
hanging
about
stations
and
the
for
buses
it
was
dreadfully
hard
work
and
after
four
days
of
it
even
welsh
began
to
get
a
little
sickened
hang
it
he
said
in
the
evening
i
haven
t
had
a
decent
dinner
since
we
came
back
mr
bunker
can
go
to
the
devil
for
i
m
going
to
dine
decently
i
m
sick
of
going
round
pubs
and
not
even
stopping
to
have
a
so
am
i
replied
twiddel
cordially
where
shall
we
go
the
café
maccarroni
suggested
welsh
we
can
t
afford
a
place
and
they
give
one
a
very
decent
dinner
the
café
maccarroni
in
holborn
is
nominally
of
foreign
extraction
the
waiters
and
the
stout
proprietor
come
from
sunnier
lands
many
of
the
diners
you
can
hear
talking
in
strange
tongues
with
quick
gesticulations
but
for
the
most
part
they
are
respectable
citizens
of
london
who
drink
chianti
because
it
stimulates
cheaply
and
not
unpleasantly
the
room
is
bright
and
clean
and
seldom
very
crowded
the
british
palate
can
be
tickled
with
tolerable
joints
and
cutlets
and
the
foreign
with
odds
and
ends
altogether
it
may
be
recommended
to
such
as
desire
to
dine
comfortably
and
not
too
conspicuously
the
hour
at
which
the
two
friends
entered
was
later
than
most
of
the
dine
and
they
had
the
room
almost
to
themselves
they
faced
each
other
across
a
small
table
beside
the
wall
and
very
soon
the
discomforts
of
their
researches
began
to
seem
more
tolerable
we
ll
catch
him
soon
old
man
said
welsh
smiling
more
affably
than
he
had
smiled
since
they
came
back
a
day
or
two
more
of
this
kind
of
work
and
even
london
won
t
be
able
to
conceal
him
any
dash
it
we
must
replied
twiddel
bravely
we
ll
show
old
congleton
how
to
look
for
a
ha
ha
laughed
welsh
i
think
he
ll
be
rather
relieved
himself
waiter
another
bottle
of
the
the
bottle
arrived
and
the
waiter
was
just
filling
their
glasses
when
a
young
clergyman
entered
the
room
and
walked
quietly
towards
the
farther
end
welsh
raised
his
glass
and
exclaimed
here
s
luck
to
ourselves
twiddel
old
man
at
that
moment
the
clergyman
was
passing
their
table
and
at
the
mention
of
this
toast
he
started
almost
imperceptibly
and
then
throwing
a
quick
glance
at
the
two
stopped
and
took
a
seat
at
the
next
table
with
his
back
turned
towards
them
welsh
who
was
at
the
farther
side
looked
at
him
with
some
annoyance
and
made
a
sign
to
twiddel
to
talk
a
little
more
quietly
to
the
waiter
who
came
with
the
the
clergyman
explained
in
a
quiet
voice
that
he
was
waiting
for
a
friend
and
asked
for
an
evening
paper
instead
in
which
he
soon
appeared
to
be
deeply
engrossed
at
first
the
conversation
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
but
in
a
few
minutes
they
insensibly
forgot
their
neighbour
and
the
voices
rose
again
by
starts
my
dear
fellow
welsh
was
saying
we
can
discuss
that
afterwards
we
haven
t
caught
him
i
want
to
settle
it
but
i
thought
it
was
no
it
wasn
t
said
twiddel
with
a
foreign
and
vinous
doggedness
what
do
you
suggest
then
divide
it
you
think
you
can
claim
half
the
credit
for
the
idea
and
half
the
trouble
i
can
claim
the
pooh
said
welsh
you
think
i
risked
nothing
come
come
let
s
talk
of
something
oh
rot
interrupted
twiddel
who
by
this
time
was
decidedly
flushed
you
needn
t
ride
the
high
horse
like
that
you
are
not
mr
any
with
a
violent
start
the
clergyman
brought
his
fist
crash
on
the
table
and
exclaimed
aloud
by
heaven
that
s
it
chapter
as
one
may
suppose
everybody
in
the
room
started
in
great
astonishment
at
this
extraordinary
outburst
with
a
sharp
hollo
twiddel
turned
in
his
seat
to
see
the
clergyman
standing
over
him
with
a
look
of
the
keenest
inquiry
in
his
face
may
i
ask
dr
twiddel
what
you
know
of
the
gentleman
you
just
named
he
said
with
perfect
politeness
the
doctor
gazed
at
him
blankly
and
the
colour
suddenly
left
his
face
but
welsh
s
nerves
were
stronger
and
as
he
looked
hard
at
the
stranger
a
jubilant
light
leaped
to
his
eyes
it
s
our
man
he
cried
before
his
friend
could
gather
his
wits
it
s
beveridge
or
bunker
or
whatever
he
calls
himself
waiter
instantly
three
waiters
all
agog
hurried
at
his
summons
mr
bunker
regarded
him
with
considerable
surprise
he
had
quite
expected
that
the
pair
would
be
thrown
into
confusion
but
not
that
it
would
take
this
form
excuse
me
sir
he
began
but
welsh
interrupted
him
by
crying
to
the
leading
fetch
a
cab
and
a
policeman
quick
as
the
man
hesitated
he
added
this
man
here
is
an
escaped
the
waiter
was
starting
for
the
door
when
mr
bunker
stepped
out
quickly
and
interrupted
him
stop
one
minute
waiter
he
said
with
a
quiet
unruffled
air
that
went
far
to
establish
his
sanity
do
i
look
like
a
lunatic
kindly
call
the
proprietor
the
stout
proprietor
was
already
on
his
way
to
their
table
and
the
one
or
two
other
diners
were
beginning
to
gather
round
mr
bunker
s
manner
had
impressed
even
welsh
and
after
his
nature
he
took
refuge
in
bluster
i
say
my
man
he
cried
this
won
t
pass
somebody
fetch
a
vat
is
dees
about
asked
the
proprietor
coming
up
your
wine
i
m
afraid
has
been
rather
too
powerful
for
this
gentleman
mr
bunker
explained
with
a
smile
look
here
blustered
welsh
do
you
know
you
ve
got
a
lunatic
in
the
room
you
can
perhaps
guess
it
smiled
mr
bunker
indicating
welsh
with
his
eyes
the
waiters
began
to
twitter
and
welsh
with
an
effort
pulled
himself
together
my
friend
here
he
said
is
dr
twiddel
a
practitioner
in
london
he
can
tell
you
that
he
certified
this
man
as
a
lunatic
and
that
he
afterwards
escaped
from
his
asylum
that
is
so
twiddel
yes
assented
twiddel
whose
colour
was
beginning
to
come
back
a
little
who
are
you
sare
asked
the
proprietor
show
him
your
card
twiddel
said
welsh
producing
his
own
and
handing
it
over
the
proprietor
looked
at
both
cards
and
then
turned
to
mr
bunker
and
who
are
you
sare
my
name
is
his
began
welsh
have
you
a
card
interposed
the
proprietor
i
am
sorry
i
have
not
replied
mr
bunker
to
still
call
him
by
the
name
of
his
choice
his
name
is
francis
beveridge
said
welsh
i
beg
your
pardon
it
is
any
other
description
welsh
asked
with
a
sneer
a
gentleman
i
no
other
occupation
not
unless
you
can
call
a
justice
of
the
peace
such
replied
mr
bunker
with
a
smile
and
yet
he
disguises
himself
as
a
clergyman
exclaimed
welsh
triumphantly
turning
to
the
proprietor
mr
bunker
saw
that
he
was
caught
but
he
merely
laughed
and
observed
my
friend
here
disguises
himself
in
liquor
a
much
less
respectable
unfortunately
the
humour
of
this
remark
was
somewhat
thrown
away
on
his
present
audience
indeed
coming
from
a
professed
clergyman
it
produced
an
unfavourable
impression
you
are
not
a
clergyman
said
the
proprietor
suspiciously
i
am
glad
to
say
i
am
not
replied
mr
bunker
frankly
den
vat
do
you
do
in
dis
dress
i
put
it
on
as
a
compliment
to
the
cloth
i
retain
it
at
present
for
decency
said
mr
bunker
whose
tongue
had
now
got
a
fair
start
of
him
mad
remarked
welsh
confidentially
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
really
excellent
dramatic
effect
by
this
time
the
audience
were
disposed
to
agree
with
him
you
can
give
no
better
account
of
yourself
dan
dis
asked
the
proprietor
i
am
anxious
to
replied
mr
bunker
but
a
public
restaurant
is
not
the
place
in
which
i
choose
to
give
fetch
the
cab
and
the
policeman
said
welsh
to
a
waiter
at
this
moment
another
gentleman
entered
the
room
and
at
the
sight
of
him
mr
bunker
s
face
brightened
and
he
stopped
the
waiter
by
a
cry
of
wait
one
moment
here
comes
a
gentleman
who
knows
everybody
turned
and
beheld
a
burly
very
fashionably
dressed
young
man
with
a
fair
moustache
and
a
cheerful
countenance
ach
bonker
he
cried
this
confirmation
of
mr
bunker
s
ought
one
would
expect
to
have
delighted
the
two
conspirators
but
instead
it
produced
the
most
remarkable
effect
twiddel
utterly
collapsed
while
even
welsh
s
impudence
at
last
deserted
him
neither
said
a
word
as
the
baron
von
blitzenberg
greeted
his
friend
with
affectionate
heartiness
my
friend
zis
is
good
for
ze
heart
bot
how
vat
makes
it
here
my
dear
baron
the
most
unfortunate
mistake
has
occurred
two
men
but
at
this
moment
he
stopped
in
great
surprise
for
the
baron
was
staring
hard
first
at
welsh
and
then
at
twiddel
ah
he
exclaimed
mr
i
zink
welsh
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
his
hesitation
was
evident
to
all
then
he
replied
no
you
are
surely
i
can
not
be
you
did
stay
in
fogelschloss
said
the
baron
is
not
zis
dr
twiddel
stammered
twiddel
looking
feebly
at
welsh
the
baron
looked
from
the
one
to
the
other
in
great
perplexity
when
mr
bunker
who
had
been
much
puzzled
by
this
conversation
broke
in
did
you
call
that
person
i
cairtainly
zought
it
where
did
you
meet
him
in
bavaria
at
my
own
you
are
mistaken
sir
said
welsh
one
moment
mr
welsh
said
mr
bunker
how
long
ago
was
this
baron
jost
before
i
gom
to
london
he
travelled
viz
zis
ozzer
gentleman
dr
you
are
wrong
sir
persisted
welsh
for
his
health
added
the
baron
a
light
began
to
dawn
on
mr
bunker
his
health
he
cried
and
then
smiled
politely
at
welsh
we
will
talk
this
over
mr
i
am
sorry
i
happen
to
be
going
said
welsh
taking
his
hat
and
coat
what
without
your
lunatic
asked
mr
bunker
that
is
dr
twiddel
s
affair
not
mine
kindly
let
me
pass
no
mr
welsh
if
you
go
now
it
will
be
in
the
company
of
that
policeman
you
were
so
anxious
to
send
there
was
such
an
unmistakable
threat
in
mr
bunker
s
voice
and
eye
that
welsh
hesitated
we
will
talk
it
over
mr
welsh
mr
bunker
repeated
distinctly
kindly
sit
down
i
have
several
things
to
ask
you
and
your
friend
dr
muttering
something
under
his
breath
welsh
hung
up
his
coat
and
hat
sat
down
and
then
assuming
an
air
of
great
impudence
remarked
fire
away
mr
or
whatever
you
call
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
this
piece
of
humour
mr
bunker
turned
to
the
bewildered
proprietor
and
to
the
intense
disappointment
of
the
audience
said
you
can
leave
us
now
thank
you
our
talk
is
likely
to
be
of
a
somewhat
private
as
their
gallery
withdrew
he
drew
up
a
chair
for
the
baron
and
all
four
sat
round
the
small
table
now
said
mr
bunker
to
welsh
you
will
perhaps
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
a
precise
account
of
your
doings
since
the
middle
of
i
m
if
i
do
replied
welsh
sare
interposed
the
baron
in
his
stateliest
manner
i
know
not
now
who
you
may
be
but
i
see
you
are
no
gentleman
ven
you
are
viz
vill
please
to
speak
the
stare
that
welsh
attempted
in
reply
was
somewhat
ineffective
perhaps
dr
twiddel
you
can
give
the
account
i
want
said
mr
bunker
the
poor
doctor
looked
at
his
friend
hesitated
and
finally
stammered
out
don
t
see
mr
bunker
pulled
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
him
perhaps
this
may
suggest
a
when
the
doctor
saw
the
bill
for
mr
beveridge
s
linen
the
last
of
his
courage
ebbed
away
he
glanced
helplessly
at
welsh
but
his
ally
was
now
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
such
an
irritating
assumption
of
indifference
and
the
prospective
fee
had
so
obviously
vanished
that
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
the
most
virtuous
resolutions
what
do
you
want
to
know
sir
he
asked
in
the
first
place
how
did
you
come
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
welsh
whose
sharp
wits
instantly
divined
the
weak
point
in
the
attack
cut
in
quickly
don
t
tell
him
if
he
doesn
t
know
already
but
twiddel
s
relapse
to
virtue
was
complete
i
was
asked
to
take
charge
of
you
he
hesitated
while
i
was
unwell
smiled
mr
bunker
yes
i
was
to
travel
with
ah
but
didn
t
like
the
idea
you
see
and
suggested
that
i
should
take
him
while
you
locked
me
up
in
clankwood
ha
ha
ha
laughed
mr
bunker
i
must
say
it
was
a
devilish
humorous
at
this
twiddel
began
to
take
heart
again
i
am
very
sorry
sir
he
began
when
the
baron
interrupted
excitedly
zen
vat
is
your
name
bonker
am
mr
the
baron
looked
at
the
other
two
in
turn
with
eyes
then
he
turned
indignantly
upon
welsh
you
were
impostor
zen
sare
you
gom
to
my
house
and
call
yourself
a
gentleman
and
impose
upon
me
and
tell
of
your
family
and
your
estates
you
a
you
say
low
bonker
i
can
not
sit
at
ze
same
table
viz
zese
persons
he
rose
as
he
spoke
one
moment
baron
before
we
send
these
gentlemen
back
to
their
really
promising
career
of
fraud
i
want
to
ask
one
or
two
more
he
turned
to
twiddel
what
were
you
to
be
paid
for
this
mr
bunker
opened
his
eyes
that
s
the
way
my
money
goes
from
your
anxiety
to
recapture
me
i
presume
you
have
not
yet
been
paid
no
i
assure
you
mr
essington
said
twiddel
eagerly
i
give
you
my
i
shall
judge
by
the
circumstances
rather
than
your
word
sir
it
is
perhaps
unnecessary
to
inform
you
that
you
have
had
your
trouble
for
he
looked
at
them
both
as
though
they
were
curious
animals
and
then
continued
you
mr
welsh
are
a
really
wonderfully
typical
rascal
i
am
glad
to
have
met
you
you
can
now
put
on
your
coat
and
as
welsh
still
sat
defiantly
he
added
sir
or
you
may
possibly
find
policemen
and
cabs
outside
i
have
something
else
to
say
to
dr
with
the
best
air
he
could
muster
welsh
silently
cocked
his
hat
on
the
side
of
his
head
threw
his
coat
over
his
arm
and
was
walking
out
when
a
watchful
waiter
intercepted
him
your
bill
my
friend
is
no
mr
welsh
cried
the
real
essington
i
think
you
had
better
pay
for
this
dinner
welsh
saw
the
vigilant
proprietor
already
coming
towards
him
and
with
a
look
that
augured
ill
for
twiddel
when
they
were
alone
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
ha
ha
laughed
essington
the
inevitable
bill
and
now
he
continued
turning
to
twiddel
you
doctor
seem
to
me
a
most
unfortunately
constructed
biped
your
nose
is
just
long
enough
to
enable
you
to
be
led
into
a
singularly
original
adventure
and
your
brains
just
too
few
to
carry
it
through
creditably
hang
me
if
i
wouldn
t
have
made
a
better
job
of
the
business
but
before
you
disappear
from
the
company
of
gentlemen
i
must
ask
you
to
do
one
favour
for
me
first
thing
morning
you
will
go
down
to
clankwood
tell
what
lie
you
please
and
obtain
my
legal
discharge
or
whatever
it
s
called
after
that
you
may
go
to
the
what
comes
much
to
the
same
thing
to
mr
all
i
care
you
will
do
this
without
fail
stammered
twiddel
certainly
you
may
now
the
faster
the
as
the
crestfallen
doctor
followed
his
ally
out
of
the
restaurant
the
baron
exclaimed
in
disgust
ze
cads
you
are
too
merciful
you
should
my
dear
baron
after
all
i
am
obliged
to
these
rascals
for
the
most
amusing
time
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
and
one
of
the
best
friends
i
ve
ever
ach
bonker
bot
vat
do
i
say
you
are
not
bonker
no
more
and
yet
may
i
call
you
so
jost
for
ze
sake
of
pleasant
times
it
vill
be
too
hard
to
i
d
rather
you
would
baron
it
will
be
a
perpetual
in
memoriam
record
of
my
departed
departed
bonker
departed
baron
his
friend
repeated
with
a
sigh
for
how
can
i
ever
hope
to
have
so
spacious
a
field
for
them
again
believe
me
they
will
wither
in
an
atmosphere
of
orthodoxy
and
now
let
us
order
but
first
said
the
baron
blushing
