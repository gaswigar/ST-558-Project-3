poem
fridthjof
saga
has
been

large

in
almost
every
possible
style

has
been
illustrated
and
it
has
been
set
to
music
it
has
been
translated
into
nearly
all
the
modern
european
languages
moreover
it
has
been
rendered

edited
an
american
edition
of
a
translation
by
rev
william
blackley
of
dublin
and
published
it
about
ten
years
ago
professor
anderson
has
just
published
in
his
viking
tales
a
translation
made
by
professor
george
stephens
of
copenhagen
and
which
received
the
sanction
of
bishop
himself
and
yet
we
venture
to
add
another
and
present
here
the
american
translation
taylor
said
in
his
preface
to
blackley
version
that
there
had
never
been
an
english
fridthjof
saga
which
was
satisfactory
to
swedes
this
is
probably
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
swedes
have
become
so
familiar
with
its
original
measures
and
so
accustomed
to
its
peculiar
rhythm
that
they
can
not
willingly
dispense
with
any
part
of
the
form
which
gave
it
several
of
the
metres
employed
by
him
were
unknown
to
swedish
readers
until
they
appeared
in
this
poem
experiment
of
introducing
them
was
a
successful
one
and
they
are
now
in
the
minds
of
swedes
as
much
a
part
of
the
work
as
the
story
itself
the
feminine
rhymes
occurring
in
fifteen
of
the
cantos
are
so
melodious
that
no
one
who
had
heard
the
original
even
if
he
did
not
understand
a
word
of
it
could
be
quite
satisfied
with
a
version
which
does
not
reproduce
them
the
feminine
rhymes
and
the
alliteration
of
canto
xxi
have
presented
obstacles
which
no
single
translation
has
hitherto
overcome
the
original
measures
the
feminine
rhymes
and
the
alliteration
of
drapa
are
in
our
estimation
essential
features
of
a
good
rendering
of
the
poem
and
if
we
have
done
our
work
well
we
do
not
fear
that
any
one
will
think
there
are
too
many
translations
for
a
fuller
history
of
fridthjof
saga
than
can
be
given
in
this
note
we
refer
the
reader
to
anderson
viking
tales
where
the
sagas
on
which
this
story
is
founded
appear
in
full
the
preparation
of
this
translation
has
been
a
home
work
which
has
brightened
for
us
the
firelight
of
many
a
pleasant
evening
we
publish
it
in
full
faith
that
it
will
have
a
like
happy
effect
in
whatever
home
it
may
be
read

two
rare
and
stately
plants
were

unequaled
grace
and
beauty
showing
the
one
a
sturdy
oak
tree
grew
with
stem
so
straight
and
true
its
crown
in
northern
tempests
shaking
like
helmet
plume
in
battle
quaking
the
other
like
a
rose
sprang
forth
when
tardy
winter
leaves
the
north
and
spring
which
in
the
buds
lies
dreaming
still
waits
with
gems
to
set
them
gleaming

raves

oak

so
they
grew
up
in
joy
and
glee
and
fridthjof
was
the
young
oak
tree
unfolding
in
the
vale
serenely
the
rose
was
ingeborg
the
queenly
saw
you
those
two
by
light
of
day
you
seem
in
freyja
house
to
stay
where
were
swinging
their
way
on
rosy
pinions
winging
but
seeing
them
by
moonlight
pale
round
dancing
in
the
leafy
vale
you
think
the
now
advances
and
leads
his
queen
in
fairy
dances
how
joyful
was
how
lovely
too
when
firs
he
learned
his
futhorc
through
no
kings
had
such
honor
brought
them
as
when
to
ingeborg
he
taught
them
how
joyously
his
boat
would
glide
with
those
two
the
dark
blue
tide
while
he
the
driving
sail
was
veering
her
small
white
hands
gave
hearty
cheering
no
bird
nest
found
so
high
a
spot
that
he
for
her
could
find
it
not
the
eagle
nest
from
clouds
he
sundered
and
eggs
and
young
he
deftly
plundered
however
swift
there
ran
no
brook
but
it
ingeborg
he
took
how
sweet
when
roaring
torrents
frighten
to
feel
her
soft
arms
round
him
tighten
the
first
spring
flowers
by
sunshine
fed
the
earliest
berries
turning
red
the
first
of
autumn
golden
treasure
he
proffered
her
with
eager
pleasure
but
quickly
sped
are
childhood
days
there
stands
a
youth
whose
ardent
gaze
with
pleading
and
with
hope
is
laden
and
there
with
budding
charms
a
maiden
young
fridthjof
followed
oft
the
chase
which
led
to
many
a
fearful
place
with
neither
spear
nor
lance
defended
the
wild
bear
life
he
quickly
ended
when
struggling
met
they
breast
to
breast
the
hunter
won
though
hardly
pressed
and
brought
the
bearskin
home
such
prizes
think
you
a
maiden
despises
for

courage
rare
the
brave
alone
deserves
the

each
one
the

grace
completing
as

fitly
meeting
and
when
in
winter
evenings
long
by
firelight
reading
in
a
song
of
fair
abodes
in
radiant

to
every
god

a

encloses

fairies
two
with
buds
of
roses
and
frigg
mild
eyes
are
blue
and
clear
as
heaven
when
no
clouds
appear
but
i
know
eyes
beside
whose
sparkles
a
light
blue
spring
day
quickly
darkles
and
gerd
fair
cheeks
why
praise
them
so
the
on

snow
i
know
of
cheeks
whose
rosy
warnings
portray
at
once
two
ruddy
mornings
i
know
a
heart
like
nanna
though
not
so
renowned
and
nanna
love
in
song
and
story
is
justly
reckoned
balder
glory
for
oh
what
joy
when
death
appears
to
have
a
faithful
maiden
tears
to
prove
a
love
so
strong
and
tender
with

grim
shades
i
gladly
wander
meanwhile
the

gayly
wove
in
cloth

and
as
she
sang
a
hero
story
she
also
wove
a
hero

soon
there
grew

fridthjof
face
and
though
at
first
almost
affrighted
she
blushes
smiles
and
is
delighted
the
birch
tree
stem
where
fridthjof
went
showed
i
and
f
in
beauty
blent
as
grew
those
runes
in
one
delighted
so
too
those
hearts
in
one
united
when
day
invests
the
upper
air
the
with
the
golden
hair
when
men
to
action
urge
each
other
they
think
alone
of
one
another
when
night
pervades
the
upper
air
the
with
the
raven
hair
when
stars
in
silence
greet
each
other
they
dream
alone
of
one
another

thine
emerald
hair
give
me
the

in

with
him
thorstein
viking
son
the
peasant
good
his
ancient
war
companion
grown
old
in
glory
his
brow
was
scarred
like
his
hair
was
hoary
they
stood
as
on
the
mountain
two
temples
stand
to
honored
gods
devoted
now
half
in
sand
and
many
words
of
wisdom
the
walls
are
saying
and
holy
recollections
through
domes
are
straying
the
evening
steals
upon
me
king
bele
said
the
helmet
now
is
heavy
and
stale
the
mead
the
fate
of
man
grows
darker
but
all
the
clearer
high
valhal
shines
before
me
as
death
draws
nearer
my
sons
i
here
have
summoned
and
thorstein
son
for
they
should
cling
together
as
we
have
done
but
i
would
give
the
eaglets
some
words
of
warning
words

in
death
be
sleeping
ere
dawns

morning
obedient
to
the
mandate

first
helge
dark
and
gloomy
with
sullen
glance
he
dwelt
amid
diviners
the
hand
he
proffered
was
red
with
blood
of
victims
on
altars
offered
the
next
who
came
was
halfdan
a
swain
his
countenance
was
noble
but
weak
and
vain
he
gaily
bore
a
falchion
with
which
he
gestured
and
seemed
a
youthful
maiden
in
armor
vestured
and
after
them
came
fridthjof
in
mantle
blue
he
was
stronger
than
the
others
and
taller
too
he
stood
between
the
brothers
by
contrast
seeming
like
noon
night
and
morning
in
splendor
beaming
ye
sons
the
king
said
gently
my
son
goes
down
together

the
kingdom
and
take
the
crown
for
unity
is
power
and
no
endeavor
while

is
circled

stem
can
sever
let
power
stand
as
sentry
on
every
hand
and
freedom
bloom
protected
throughout
the
land
the
sword
is
for
protection
and
not
for
plunder
and
shields
are
locks
for
peasants
no
foe
can
sunder
how
foolish
is
the
ruler
his
land
to
oppress
for
the
people
give
the
power
which
kings
possess
the
crown
of

deprived

needless

most
to

of

as
well
as

the
steadfast

o
halfdan
of

to

nor

the
world
soon

the
secrets
of
three
together
these
words
then
thorstein
uttered
in
clearest
tone
king
bele
unto
odin
goes
not
alone
we
always
stood
together
whatever
tried
us
and
death
now
drawing
near
shall
not
divide
us
fridthjof
old
age
hath
whispered
in
my
rapt
ear
full
many
words
of
wisdom
which
thou
must
hear
birds
fly
from
graves
to
odin
with
wisdom
freighted
the
words
by
old
men
spoken
should
not
be
slighted
first
give
the
high
gods
honor
for
good
or
ill
storms
come
as
well
as
sunshine
by
heaven
will
the
gods
perceive
the
secrets
in
thy
possession
and
years
must
make
atonement
for
each
transgression
obey
the
king
most
wisely
rules
one
alone
the
eyes
of
night
are
many
day
has
but
one
the
better
are
contented
by
best
directed
the
blade
must
have
a
handle
to
be
perfected
great
strength
is
heaven
dower
but
fridthjof
learn
that
power
devoid
of
wisdom
can
little
earn
strong
bears
by

are
taken
one
man
of
reason
set
shields
to
turn
the
sword
stroke
let
law
stop
treason
a
few
may
fear
the
haughty
whom
all
despise
and
with
the
proud
in
spirit
destruction
lies
those
once
flew
high
who
now
on
crutches
creeping
the
winds
rule

of
reaping
the
day
rightly
prize
whose
sun
has
sunk
advice
when
it
is
followed
and
ale
when
drunk
the
hopes
of
youth
on
shadows
are
often
rested
but
strength
of
sword
and
friendship
by
use
are
trust
not
the
snow
of
nor
ice
the
serpent
when
he
sleepeth
nor
girl
advice
the
mind
of
changeful
woman
not
long
abideth
and
fickleness
of
spirit
hideth
all
men
will
surely
perish
with
all
they
prize
but
one
thing
know
i
fridthjof
which
never
dies
and
that
is
reputation
therefore
ever
the
noble
action
strive
for
the
good
endeavor
so
warned
the
aged
chieftains
in
the
palace
hall
as
since
the
skald
has
chanted
in
so
passed
these
sayings
pithy
through
generations
and
still
from
graves
they
whisper
northern
nations
then
many
words
and
heartfelt
these
warriors
found
to
tell
their
lasting
friendship
so

quite

studded

were
the

upon

hanging

and
closely

also
between

flashed
down
a

chief
in
this

three
things
were
most
of
all
valued
first
of
the
three
was
a
sword
which
from

from

descended
called
angervadil
or
sometimes
too
brother
of
lightning

far
away
in

at

says
the
story
tempered
in

bjorn
bluetooth
the
first
one
who
bore
it
bjorn
lost
at
once
both
the
sword

there
cometh
a

misshapen
higher
in

shaggy
boldly
demanding
a
combat
or
kingdom
and
daughter
no
one
however
accepted
the
challenge
for
none
had
a
weapon
able
his
hard
skull
to
pierce
and
therefore
they
called
him
the
viking
whose
winters
scarce
fifteen
had
numbered
nobly
advancing
entered
the
fray
secure
in
his
strong
arm
and
good
angervadil
cleft
at
one
blow
the
hideous
goblin
and
rescued
the
maiden

the

it

by
robber
named
soti
roaming
abroad
through

long
was
it
ere
was
recovered
finally
so
runs
the
story
was
said
that
the
robber
had
buried
himself
with
his
ship
and
his
treasure
deep
on
the
far
coast
of
britain

with

the

ship
mounted
dashed
through
the
foaming
waves
straight
to
the
place
of
the
sepulcher
steering

gateway
bedded
in

covered
with

arched

the

rose
forbidding
light
issued
from
it
through
a
small
crevice
within
the
closed

peered
the
two
champions
there
the
pitched
viking
ship
stood
with
its
masts
its
yards
and
its
anchor
high
in
the
stern
sheets
was
seated
a
terrible
figure
clad
in
a
mantle
all
flaming
furious
demon
scouring
a
blade
that
with
blood
spots
was
covered
vain
was
his
labor
naught
could
remove
them
all
his
rich
booty
round
him
was
scattered
and
on
his
arm
was
the
ring
he
had
stolen
go
we
said
bele
down
thither
and
fight
with
the
hideous
goblin
two
a
spirit
of
fire
but
thorstein
half
angrily
answered
one
against
one
is
the
rule
of
our
fathers
i
fight
well
singly
long
they
contended
which
first
of
the
two
the
encounter
should
venture
proving
the
perilous
journey
bele
at
last
took
his
helmet
shaking
two
lots
therein
watched
by
the
stars
thorstein
saw
by
their
shimmer
his
was
the
lot
first
appearing
a
blow
from
his
javelin
of
iron
cleft
the
huge
bolts
and
strong
locks
he
descended
did
any
one
question
what
was
revealed
in
the
cavern
then
was
he
silent
and
shuddered
bele
at
first
heard
strange
music
it
rang
like
the
song
of
a
goblin
then
was
a
clattering
noise
like
the
clashing
of
blades
in
a
combat
lastly
a
hideous
shriek
then
silence
out
staggered
thorstein
confounded
bewildered
all
pale
was
his
face
for
with
death
had
he
battled
yet
bore
he
the
a
trophy
was
dear
bought
he
often
said
frowning
once
in
my
life
was
i
frightened
was
when
i
recovered
that
widely
renowned
was
that
ring
and
of
rings
was
the
chief
in
the
northland
lastly
the
ship
called
ellide
was
one
of
the
family
jewels
viking
so
say
they
returning
triumphant
from
venturesome
journeys
sailed
along
coasting
near
framness
there
he
espied
on
a
shipwreck
carelessly
swinging
a
sailor
sporting
as
with
the
billows
noble
of

tall
in

golden
his

studded
with

his
hair
but
his
beard
was
as
white
as
the
foam
of
the
ocean
viking
his
serpent
steered
thither
to
rescue
the
unfortunate
stranger
took
him
half
frozen
to
framness
and
there
as
a
guest
entertained
him
when
by
his
host
to
repose
he
was
bidden
smiling
he
answered
fair
sits
the
wind
and
my
ship
which
you
boarded
is
not
yet
disabled
long
ere
the
morning
i
trust
she
will
hear
me
a
hundred
miles
seaward
thanks
for
thy
bidding

well
meant
and
kindly
ah
could
i
only
leave
thee
a
gift
to
remind

through

a

was

sudden
as
ruled
by
a

reefed
were
the

unassisted
untouched
by

of

the

sped
through
the
clear

fastened
its

in

thee
the

the

the
heavy

matched
not
together

grew
in
one
broad
piece
united
it
stretched
its

in
the

like
a
dragon
its
stem
proudly
lifted
a
stately

high
in

with

all
blazing

flew
in

left

whom
he
honored
beyond
all
praising
in
glad
conversation
recalling
their
plays
when
life
morning
dew
presaged
bright
future
days
for
memory
truthful
keeps
life
rosy
gardens
in
noble
minds
youthful
how
fondly
she
greets
him
from
dale
and
from
park
from
loving
names
growing
in
white
birchen
bark
from
hills
where
flourish
the
oaks
which
the
ashes
of
heroes
nourish
is
never
so
pleasant
at
home
as
here
for
halfdan
is
childish
and
helge
severe
tho
kings
attending
to
nothing
but
prayers
and
praise
unending
and
no
one
nor
could
she
her
blushes
hide
to
whom
my
complainings
i
may
confide
the
palace
building
how
stifling
compared
with
the
groves
of
hilding
the
doves
that
we
petted
and
tamed
and
fed
by
hawks
oft
affrighted
away
have
fled
one
pair
remaineth
let
fridthjof
take
one
one
retaineth
she
long
like
another
her
friend
to
see
and
homeward
returning
will
fly
to
me
your
message
bind
it
beneath
her
flee
pinion
there
none
will
find
it
all
day
they
sat
whispering
side
by
side
nor
ceased
the
low
murmur
at
eventide
so
breathe
in
whispers
the
zephyrs
through
lindens
at
twilight
vespers
but
now
she
has
gone
and
his
joy
forsooth
has
gone
with
the
maiden
the
blood
of
youth
his
cheek
is
mounting
he
silently
sighs
while
the
past
recounting
his
grief
at
her
absence
he
sent
by
the
dove
which
joyous
set
out
with
its
message
of
love
but
oh
new
sorrow
it
stayed
with
its
mate
nor
returned
on
the
morrow
his
conduct
to
bjorn
was
displeasing
said
he
what
ails
our
young
eagle
he
seems
to
be
like
some
shy
sparrow
has
his
breast
or
his
pinion
been
pierced
by
an
arrow
what
wilt
thou
fridthjof
we
have
for
need
the
yellow
bacon
and
the
good
brown
mead
and
poets
singing
their
jubilant
music
forever
ringing
the
steeds
impatiently
stamp
in
the
stalls
to
the
chase
to
the
chase
the
falcon
calls
but
fridthjof
retaineth
his
gloom
he
hunteth
in
clouds
and
complaineth
ellide
is
restless
upon
the
main
she
frets
and
she
chafes
at
her
cable
chain
lie
still
my
treasure
our
fridthjof
is
peaceable
strife
is
no
pleasure
who
dies
on
his
pallet
is
dead
indeed
by
the
lance
as
did
odin
we
die
if
need
and
thus
ensure
us
a
welcome
to

and

secure

then
fridthjof
unloos

with
full

oh
that
my

soul
releasing
the

would
take
me
up

triumphantly
with

unceasing
i

when

rally
from

they
ride
but

join
not

with

thee

us
by

there
we
rest
us
the

a

and
when

valhal
sun
each
morning
with
his
clear
torch
in
splendor
rose
we
hasten
to
the

returning
yet
longing
for
our

repose
thy
golden
locks
with
sunshine
flushing
wreathed
with
a
starry
crown
should
be
so
my
pale

rosy
blushing
in
should
dance
with

then
by

from

guarded
i
with
thee
to

where

our

song
each
evening
fair
how
sweet
the
evening
vesper
it
cometh
forth
from

shore
how
soft
the
gentle
whisper
from
where
the
dead
live
evermore
they
tell
of
light
and
love
unbroken
in
homes
devoid
of
care
and
pain
where
joyous
words
alone
are
spoken
there
thou
my
love
shalt
ever
reign
oh
weep
not
love
those
tears
regretful
while
through
my
heart
the
streams
but
sweetly
sleep
of
grief
forgetful
may
love
and
fridthjof
fill
thy
dreams
oh
when
thine
arms
thou
foldest
round
me
when
thy
dear
eyes
but
look
on
me
how
quickly
breaks
the
spell
that
bound
me
how
turn
my
thoughts
from

to
thee

to
the

sings
the
lark
on
yonder
hillock
slumbers
beside
his
mate
with
folded
wings
how
happy
they
always
together
as
free
their
life
as
wings
that
bear
through
cheerless
storm
or
sunny
weather
above
the
clouds
that
happy
pair
see
daybreak
comes
nay
but
ascended
from
some
far
beacon
is
the
light
our
happy
talk
is
not
yet
ended
nor
yet
so
soon
the
lovely
night
bright
morning

and
when
night
cometh
slumber
still
your
waking
brings
to
fridthjof
sorrow
so
sleep
till
doomsday
if
you
will
vain
hope
no
longer
earth
reposes
the
morning
breeze
new
pleasure
seeks
already
bud
the
eastern
roses
as
fresh
as
those
on
checks
i
hear
the
winged
songsters
twitter
a
thoughtless
throng
in
the
opening
sky
all
life
astir
the
wavelets
glitter
and
lover
must
with
shadows
fly
ah
there
he
comes
in
glory
beaming
forgive
o
golden
sun
my
prayer
how
beautiful
in
splendor
gleaming
i
feel
i
know
a
god
is
near
oh
who
could
in
thy
path
advancing
with
equal
grace
and
power
tread
all
hearts
with
light
and
joy
entrancing
a
life
like
thine
victorious
lead
here
thy
watchful
eye
i
leave
her
my
peerless
beauty
of
the
north
let
not
the
rough
world
troubles
grieve
her
thy
likeness
on
the
earth
her
soul
is
pure
as
rays
of
morning
her
eyes
as
blue
as
thine
own
sky
the
same
rich
tints
thy
crown
adorning
among
her
golden
tresses

farewell
my
love
be
not
forgetful
some
longer
night
again
we
meet
i
lingering
kiss
thy
brow
regretful
one
kiss
i
give
thy
lips
so
sweet
sleep
now
beloved
in
thy
slumber
may
dreams
of
me
thy
bosom
swell
at

with

number
each

farewell
farewell
viii
the
parting
ingeborg
the
day
breaks
clear
and
fridthjof
cometh
not
though
yesterday
the
council
was
proclaimed
at
bele
grave
the
place
was
rightly
chosen
his
daughter
fate
should
be
determined
there
how
many
supplications
hath
it
cost
me
how
many
tears
by
freyja
counted
to
melt
the
ice
of
hate
around
fridthjof
heart
and
gain
a
promise
from
his
haughty
lips
to
give
his
hand
in
reconciliation
alas
how
hard
is
man
and
for
his
honor
so
calleth
he
his
pride
he
counts
it
not
or
lightly
counts
it
if
he
rudely
break
of
true
and
faithful
hearts
one
more
or
less
but
wretched
woman
leaning
on
his
breast
is
like
the
blooming
on
the
cliff
with
faded
tints
it
difficultly
holds
itself
unnoticed
fast
unto
the
rock
is
only
nourished
by
the
dews
of
night
but
yesterday
indeed
my
fate
was
fixed
and
now
the
evening
sun
hath
set
upon
it
still
fridthjof
cometh
not
the
pallid
stars
die
one
by
one
and
sadly
disappear
and
with
each
one
of
them
a
hope
is
quenched
and
goes
from
out
my
heart
unto
its
grave
ah
wherefore
still
to
hope
valhal
gods
no
longer
love
me
i
offended
them
and
balder
whose
shelter
i
reside
is
wroth
with
me
because
a
human
love
is
too
unholy
for
the
sight
of
gods
and
earthly
joy
must
never
risk
itself
beneath
the
in
which
the
grave
the
haughty
powers
have
fixed
their
and
yet
what
fault
is
mine
and
wherefore
frowns
the
pious
god
upon
a
maiden
love
is
it
not
pure
as
urd
bright
sparkling
fount
and
innocent
as
gefjon
morning
dream
the
shining
sun
doth
never
turn
away
from
loving
ones
its
pure
and
watchful
eyes
and
daylight
widow
starry
night
doth
hear
with
gladness
in
her
sorrow
all
their
vows
that
which
is
worthy
under
heaven
vault
can
that
be
guilty
the
temple
dome
i
love
my
fridthjof
oh
through
all
the
past
as
far
as
memory
runs
i
loved
him
well
a
holy
feeling
with
my
soul
i
know
not
whence
it
came
nor
comprehend
the
dismal
thought
that
it
was
ever
gone
as
fruit
is
timely
set
about
the
stone
and
groweth
up
and
round
about
it
all
in
summer
sunshine
wraps
its
cloth
of
gold
so
too
indeed
have
i
maturing
grown
about
this
stone
and
my
existence
is
of
my
affection
but
the
outer
shell
forgive
me
balder
with
a
faithful
heart
thy
hall
i
sought
and
with
a
faithful
one
will
i
go
hence
i
take
it
with
me
now
out
over
and
place
myself
with
all
my
love
before
great
valhal
gods
and
there
my
love
like
them
an
shall
see
itself
reflected
in
the
shields
and
fly
with
loosened
through
the
blue
unending
space
unto
the
allfather
bosom
from
whence
it
came
oh
wherefore
is
the
frown
in
morning
twilight
on
thy
brow
so
fair
there
floweth
in
my
veins
as
flows
in
thine
old
odin
blood
what
wilt
thou
kinsman
dear
my
ardent
love
i
can
not
offer
thee
nor
would
i
offer
it
worth
all
thy
joys
but
i
can
offer
thee
my
life
delight
can
cast
it
from
me
as
the
stately
queen
her
mantle
flings
aside
and
still
remains
her
queenly
self
but
my
resolve
is
taken
and
valhal
high
shall
never
be
ashamed
to
own
me
kindred
i
will
meet
my
fate
as
meets
the
hero
his
ah
here
he
comes
how
wild
he
seems
how
pale
is
done
is
done
my
angry
norn
she
comes
beside
him
now
be
strong
my
soul
at
last
i
welcome
thee
our
fate
is
fixed
is
plain
to
read
it
where
upon
thy
brow
it
stands
fridthjof
and
stand
not
there
as
well
the
runes
which
speak
of
shame
and
scorn
and
banishment
ingeborg
oh
fridthjof
think
relate
what
passed
for
i
have
long
foreseen
the
worst
and
am
prepared
for
all
fridthjof
i
found
the
council
at
our
fathers
graves
around
the
grassy
mounds
shield
meeting
shield
stood
many
northland
sons
with
swords
in
hand
one
circle
standing
close
within
another
unto
the
top
upon
the
judgment
seat
a
thunder
cloud
thy
brother
helge
sat
a
pallid
headsman
with
a
dusky
look
and
next
to
him
a
seeming
grown
up
child
sat
halfdan
playing
with
his
sword
then
i
arose
and
said
war
waiting
stands
within
thy
borders
beating
on
the
shield
thy
kingdom
now
king
helge
is
in
peril
give
me
my
sister
and
i
give
to
thee
mine
arm
it
may
be
usefu
in
this
strife
between
us
let
ill
will
forgotten
be
i
would
not
cherish
it
brother
to
reason
listen
king
and
save
at
once
thy
golden
crown
thy
purest
sister
heart
here
is
my
hand
by
i
swear
i
never
offer
it
again
to
thee
an
uproar
shook
the
thing
a
thousand
swords
approval
hammered
on
a
thousand
shields
the
clang
of
weapons
flew
to
heaven
which
heard
with
joy
the
assent
of
freemen
to
the
right
to
him
give
ingeborg
the
slender
lily
most
beautiful
our
dales
have
ever
grown
no
better
sword
our
favored
land
can
boast
to
him
give
ingeborg
our
the
reverend
hilding
with
his
stood
forth
and
spoke
in
words
of
wisdom
full
short
apothegms
as
keen
as
sharpened
swords
and
halfdan
too
from
off
of
royal
seat
arose
with
pleading
words
and
pleading
looks
but
it
was
all
in
vain
each
prayer
was
wasted
like
sunshine
lavished
on
a
barren
rock
no
growth
alluring
from
his
stony
heart
king
helge
sullen
countenance
was
like
his
heart
a
no
to
human
prayers
a
peasant
son
said
he
contemptuously
could
gain
but
who
profanes
the
temple
seems
to
holy
valhal
daughter
hast
thou
not
fridthjof
broken
balder
peace
hast
thou
not
seen
my
sister
in
his
temple
when
day
had
hid
itself
from
your
communion
say
yes
or
no
a
deafening
shout
resounded
from
all
those
rings
of
men
say
no
say
no
we
take
thee
at
thy
word
we
sue
for
thee
thou
son
of
thorstein
equal
to
a
king
say
no
say
no
and
ingeborg
is
thine
my
life
delight
hangs
on
a
feeble
word
said
i
but
fear
it
not
king
helge
i
would
not
lie
myself
to
valhal
joy
much
less
to
earth
thy
sister
i
have
seen
have
talked
with
her
beneath
the
temple
night
but
balder
peace
i
have
not
therefore
broken
they
let
me
say
no
more
abhorrent
cries
flew
through
the
thing
and
those
who
nearest
stood
drew
back
as
from
a
pestilent
disease
and
when
i
looked
around
their
superstition
had
palsied
every
tongue
and
blanched
each
cheek
so
lately
glowing
with
expectant
joy
and
then
king
helge
triumphed
with
a
voice
as
sad
as
awful
as
the
ghostly
in
vegtam
song
when
she
for
odin
sung
of
asas
fate
and
grim
hel
victory
so
sad
he
spoke
though
banishment
or
death
i
could
decree
by
our
ancestral
laws
against
this
crime
yet
i
be
mild
as
balder
whose
sacred
dwelling
thou
hast
so
profaned
the
western
sea
a
wreath
of
islands
holds
where
angantyr
the
earl
is
governor
as
long
as
bele
lived
the
earl
each
year
his
tribute
paid
but
ceased
when
bele
died
go
the
sea
and
drive
this
tribute
in
this
penance
thy
audacity
demands
is
said
sneered
he
with
meanest
mockery
that
angantyr
is
and
broods
like
dragon
fafner
his
gold
but
who
can
stand
our
new
sigurd
fafner
bane
exploits
more
manly
must
thou
undertake
than
luring
maidens
under
balder
roof
when
summer
comes
shall
we
expect
you
here
with
all
thy
honor
first
of
all
the
tribute
if
not
thou
art
to
every
man
a
felon
and
during
life
art
outlawed
through
the
land
his
judgment
rendered
he
dissolved
the
thing
ingeborg
and
your
decision
fridthjof
have
i
aught
to
choose
is
not
mine
honor
bound
by
his
decree
and
that
will
i
redeem
though
angantyr
his
paltry
gold
doth
hide
in
nastrand
flood
will
i
depart
ingeborg
and
leave
fridthjof
nay
nay
i
leave
thee
not
thou
goest
too
ingeborg
impossible
fridthjof
o
hear
me
ere
thou
answerest
thy
crafty
brother
seemeth
to
forget
that
angantyr
was
my
dear
father
friend
as
well
as
bele
perhaps
he
give
without
constraint
what
i
demand
if
not
a
worthy
advocate
a
sharp
one
too
have
i
is
always
ready
at
my
side
the
gold
he
covets
i
to
helge
send
and
thus
will
i
from
sacrificial
knife
of
this
crowned
hypocrite
redeem
us
both
but
we
my
beauteous
ingeborg
will
spread
seas
unknown
ellide
willing
sail
she
kindly
bear
us
to
a
friendlier
strand
where
exiled
love
may
safe
asylum
find
what
is
the
north
to
me
and
what
a
race
which
pales
at
every
word
of
priest
or
king
whose
shameless
hands
would
pluck
the
living
rose
from
out
the
sanctuary
of
my
heart
so
freyja
help
it
shall
not
prosper
them
the
wretched
slave
is
bound
unto
the
turf
where
he
was
born
hut
i
will
still
be
free
free
as
the
mountain
winds
a
little
earth
from
bele
grave
and
from
my
father
taken
can
find
a
place
upon
our
ship
and
that
is
all
of
fatherland
that
we
can
need
my
loved
one
there
another
sun
is
found
than
that
which
pales
above
these
hills
of
snow
and
there
another
sky
more
bright
than
this
and
milder
stars
with
glance
adorned
look
down
therefrom
in
balmy
summer
nights
on
lovers
wandering
in
the
laurel
groves
my
father
thorstein
viking
son
in
wars
had
journeyed
far
and
oft
i
heard
him
tell
by
fireside
light
in
winter
evenings
long
about
the
grecian
sea
with
islands
filled
fresh
groves
of
green
in
brightly
shining
waves
a
powerful
race
once
had
its
dwelling
there
and
holy
gods
the
marble
temples
graced
but
now
they
stand
deserted
grasses
thrive
in
paths
left
desolate
and
flowers
grow
from
out
the
runes
that
tell
of
ancient
lore
the
slender
columns
stand
like
budding
trees
entwined
by
graceful
stems
of
southern
vines
throughout
the
year
the
earth
spontaneous
yields
in
unsown
harvests
all
that
men
require
there
golden
apples
glow
between
the
leaves
and
blushing
grapes
from
every
bough
hang
down
and
ripening
swell
luxurious
as
thy
lips
there
there
we
build
us
near
the
wave
a
little
north
more
beautiful
than
this
and
with
our
ever
faithful
love
we
fill
the
radiant
temple
vaults
and
thus
delight
with
human
fondness
the
forgotten
gods
and
when
with
loosened
sheets
no
storms
are
there
the
sailor
idly
floats
along
our
isle
in
twilight
glow
and
turns
his
joyous
glance
from
ripples
to
the
strand
upon
the
temple
threshold
shall
he
see
a
second
freyja
aphrodite
called
in
southern
tongue
and
he
shall
wonder
at
the
golden
locks
seen
flowing
in
the
breeze
and
eyes
which
brighter
gleam
than
southern
skies
and
one
by
one
around
her
groweth
up
a
little
race
of
fairies
with
cheeks
where
yon
might
see
the
south
had
set
in
northern
snowdrifts
freshly
blooming
roses
ah
ingeborg
how
beautiful
how
near
stands
earthly
happiness
to
faithful
hearts
if
they
are
brave
enough
to
seize
it
when
disposed
it
follows
willingly
and
builds
for
them
a
vingolf
even
here
beneath
the
clouds
o
come
let
haste
away
each
spoken
word
a
moment
shorter
makes
our
waiting
joy
come
all
prepared
ellide
stretches
now
her
shadowy
eagle
wings
for
eager
flight
and
freshly
blowing
winds
now
guide
the
way
henceforth
from
this
inconstant
land
forever
why
tarriest
thou
ingeborg
i
can
not
follow
thee
fridthjof
not
follow
me
ingeborg
ah
fridthjof
thou
art
blest
thou
followest
none
but
always
in
the
front
the
stem
of
thy
good
dragon
ship
dost
place
thy
will
beside
the
helm
to
steer
the
way
with
steady
hand
above
the
wrathful
waves
how
widely
different
the
case
with
me
my
cruel
fate
is
held
in
other
hands
which
loosen
not
the
prey
although
it
bleed
and
sacrifice
lament
and
lonesome
pining
is
all
king
bele
daughter
knows
of
freedom
fridthjof
art
thou
not
free
if
so
thou
willest
in
the
grave
thy
father
sits
ingeborg
no
helge
is
my
father
is
in
my
father
stead
on
his
consent
my
hand
depends
and
will
not
steal
her
happiness
however
near
it
stands
ah
what
would
woman
be
if
she
cut
loose
the
sacred
band
with
which
the
allfather
binds
unto
the
stronger
power
her
gentle
being
the
pale
resembles
her
it
rises
with
the
wave
and
with
it
falls
the
sailor
keel
goes
forward
over
it
and
marks
it
not
although
it
cut
the
stem
such
is
indeed
her
fate
and
yet
the
flower
as
long
as
clings
the
root
unto
the
sand
its
growth
increases
borrowing
color
pure
from
its
pale
sister
stars
which
shine
above
itself
a
star
upon
the
waters
blue
but
rudely
broken
loose
it
ceaseless
drives
a
withered
leaf
along
deserted
waves
last
night
that
was
indeed
a
fearful
night
an
unrewarded
watch
i
kept
for
thee
and
children
of
the
night
the
serious
thoughts
with
raven
locks
went
thronging
closely
by
my
ever
watchful
burning
tearful
eyes
and
balder
too
the
bloodless
god
looked
down
on
me
with
frowning
glances
full
of
threats
last
night
i
pondered
my
wretched
fate
my
resolution
taken
i
remain
obedient
victim
at
my
brother
altar
yet
it
is
well
i
did
not
hear
thee
then
with
fabled
islands
floating
in
the
clouds
where
evening
glowing
twilights
always
show
a
flowery
world
of
peace
and
happy
love
who
knows
how
weak
one
is
my
childhood
dreams
though
silent
long
with
joy
rise
up
again
and
whisper
in
my
anxious
ear
with
voice
familiar
as
a
sister
kindly
tones
as
tender
as
a
lover
ardent
praise
i
hear
ye
not
ah
no
i
hear
ye
not
alluring
accents
once
so
fondly
loved
a
child
of
northland
can
not
elsewhere
dwell
too
pale
am
i
for
those
bright
summer
roses
too
colorless
my
mind
for
that
deep
glow
the
scorching
sun
would
quite
consume
me
there
of
anxious
longing
full
my
eyes
would
seek
the
northern
star
which
always
watchful
stands
a

our

graves
my
noble
fridthjof
shall
not
now
desert
the
cherished
hind
that
he
was
born
to
guard
he
shall
not
fling
away
his
honored
name
to
gain
so
poor
a
thing
a
maiden
love
a
life
where
spins
the
sun
from
year
to
year
and
where
each
day
is
ever
like
the
next
a
beauteous
but
unending
sameness
is
for
woman
only
but
for
manly
souls
and
most
for
thine
it
quiet
weary
dullness
thou
thrivest
best
where
storms
are
raging
round
on
foaming
pacers
the
heaving
sea
and
on
thy
tossing
plank
come
life
or
death
thou
mayest
fight
with
peril
for
thine
honor
the
beauteous
desert
thou
dost
paint
would
be
a
grave
for
high
achievements
not
yet
born
and
like
thy
shield
with
rust
would
be
dissolved
thine
independent
mind
it
shall
not
be
i
will
not
steal
away
my
fridthjof
name
from
poet
storied

i
will
not
quench
my
hero
glory
in
its
morning
dawn
be
wise
my
fridthjof
let
us
yield
unto
the
haughty
norn
let
us
rescue
yet
our
cherished
honor
from
this
wreck
of
life
our
happiness
we
can
not
save
is
gone
and
separate
we
must
fridthjof
and
wherefore
must
because
a
sleepless
night
disturbed
thy
mind
ingeborg
because
my
honor
must
be
saved
and
thine
fridthjof
a
woman
honor
rests
on
manly
love
ingeborg
not
long
loves
he
whom
he
can
not
respect
fridthjof
respect
is
not
by
fickle
fancy
gained
ingeborg
a
sense
of
justice
is
a
noble
fancy
fridthjof
our
love
strove
not
with
justice
yesterday
ingeborg
nor
love
to
day
but
all
the
more
our
flight
fridthjof
necessity
commands
our
flight
oh
come
ingeborg
what
right
and
noble
that
necessity
fridthjof
high
rides
the
sun
and
time
is
fleeting
by
ingeborg
ah
me
it
has
gone
by
gone
by
forever
fridthjof
consider
well
is
that
thy
last
resolve
ingeborg
i
have
considered
well
it
is
my
last
frydthjof
farewell
then
fare
thee
well
king
helge
sister
ingeborg
oh
fridthjof
fridthjof
must
we
separate
thus
hast
thou
indeed
no
friendly
glance
to
give
thy
childhood
friend
no
kindly
hand
to
reach
to
the
unfortunate
once
so
beloved
thou
i
stand
on
roses
here
and
turn
away
with
smiles
my
happiness
for
life
and
that
i
pangless
tear
from
out
my
breast
a
hope
that
hath
with
my
affections
grown
oh
wert
thou
not
my
heart
own
morning
dream
each
joy
that
i
have
known
was
fridthjof
named
and
all
of
life
that
great
or
noble
seemed
did
fridthjof
likeness
take
before
mine
eyes
bedim
the
image
not
oh
do
not
meet
with
cruelty
the
weak
one
offering
up
the
dearest
thing
upon
the
face
of
earth
the
dearest
thing
that
valhal
gods
can
give
that
offering
fridthjof
is
severe
enough
and
words
of
consolation
well
deserves
i
know
thou
lovest
me
that
i
have
known
since
my
being
first
began
to
dawn
and
thoughts
will
surely
follow
thee
for
years
to
come
wherever
thou
go
the
clang
of
warlike
weapons
deadens
grief
is
blown
away
upon
the
wild
wild
waves
nor
ventures
to
return
when
champions
all
their
victory
celebrate
with
drinking
horn
yet
sometimes
then
when
in
the
peace
of
night
thy
thoughts
review
again
forgotten
days
there
will
among
them
glide
an
image
pale
thou
knowest
well
it
fondly
greeteth
thee
from
regions
dear
it
is
the
image
of
that
virgin
pale
in
balder
holy
grove
thou
must
not
drive
it
thence
away
although
it
looketh
sorrowful
but
whisper
kind
into
its
ear
a
friendly
word
the
winds
of
night
on
faithful
wings
will
bear
it
me
one
comfort
yet
i
have
none
else
beside
for
me
there
naught
to
dissipate
my
grief
in
all
surrounding
me
it
hath
a
tongue
the
holy
temple
vaults
speak
but
of
thee
the
temple
god
which
should
all
threatening
seem
thy
likeness
takes
when
shines
the
streaming
moon
behold
the
sea
there
swam
thy
keel
through
foam
to
her
who
on
the
strand
awaited
thee
behold
the
woods
there
stand
so
many
stems
with
runes
engraven
in
the
bark
now
grows
the
bark
and
wears
away
my
name
and
that
betokens
death
the
sagas
say
i
ask
the
day
when
last
it
saw
thy
form
i
ask
the
night
but
both
are
silent
still
and
the
sea
which
bears
thee
gives
reply
but
with
a
solemn
sigh
along
the
shore
with
evening
ruddy
glow
i
send
to
thee
a
greeting
when
it
sinks
into
thy
waves
and
heaven
long
ship
the
fleeting
cloud
shall
take
on
board
the
wail
of
the
abandoned
one
so
shall
i
sit
within
my
virgin
bower
in
mourning
clad
of
all
life
joy
bereft
and
broken
lilies
sew
into
the
cloth
until
the
spring
its
cloth
doth
weave
and
sew
it
full
of
better
lilies
on
my
grave
and
when
i
sadly
take
the
harp
to
sing
unending
sorrow
in
profoundest
tones
then
burst
the
burning
tears
as
now
fridthjof
thou
conquerest
bele
daughter
weep
no
more
forgive
my
wrath
it
was
alone
my
sorrow
which
for
a
moment
took
a
wrathful
dress
a
wrathful
dress
it
can
not
long
endure
thou
art
my
kindest
norn
my
ingeborg
a
noble
mind
best
teaches
what
is
noble
necessity
real
wisdom
can
not
have
a
fairer
better
advocate
than
thou
thou
beauteous
vala
with
the
rosy
lips
i
yield
indeed
unto
necessity
i
part
with
thee
but
part
not
with
my
hope
i
take
it
with
me
over
western
waves
i
take
it
with
me
to
the
gates
of
death
the
nearest
sees
me
here
again
king
helge
so
i
hope
shall
see
me
too
then
from
my
promise
freed
his
bidding
done
the
calumny
against
me
too
atoned
then
i
request
thee
nay
but
i
demand
in
open
council
and
with
naked
swords
and
not
of
helge
but
of
northland
sons
who
only
can
dispose
a
princess
hand
i
have
a
word
for
him
who
dare
refuse
farewell
till
then
be
true
forget
me
not
and
take
in
memory
of
our
childhood

the

thy

fathoms
not
the

depths
of

twelve
best
champions
start
and
in
the
air
sharp
striking
they
brandish
sword
and
dart
they
storm
the
strand
where
by
it
the
weary
dragon
lay
but
fridthjof
sitting
nigh
it
looks
ready
for
the
fray
quite
easy
could
i
fell
thee
the
noisy
atle
cries
no
one
comes
here
i
tell
thee
but
either
fights
or
flies
if
peace
thou
believe
me
i
fight
but
am
no
churl
in
friendship
i
receive
thee
and
lead
thee
to
the
earl
although
i
scarcely
rested
is
fridthjof
sharp
reply
our
good
swords
must
be
tested
before
for
peace
i
cry
then
swift
the
fighter
his
flashing
swung
bright
glowed
the
runes
and
brighter
on
angervadil
tongue
blows
fell
without
cessation
now
deadly
blows
like
rain
and
now
in
quick
rotation
each
shield
is
cleft
in
twain
unhurt
with
wrath
unspoken
they
stand
within
the
ring
now
atle
sword
is
broken
and
fridthjof
sword
is
king
said
he
a
swordless
foeman
i
no
desire
to
slay
but
if
you
will
as
yeomen
we
try
another
way
as
waves
waves
are
pushing
and
breaking
crest
on
crest
so
on
each
other
rushing
they
wrestled
breast
to
breast
they
fought
like
two
bears
trying
their
strength
on
crust
of
snow
or
as
mad
waves
flying
the
eagle
meets
his
foe
the
firm
earth
trembled
round
them
though
based
on
solid
rock
and
oaks
though
strong
roots
bound
them
could
scarce
withstand
the
shock
their
brows
with
sweat
were
beaded
their
breasts
heaved
with
a
sound
the
brush
and
stones
unheeded
they
scattered
all
around
the
twelve
in
expectation
stood
quaking
on
the
sand
renowned
through
every
nation
that
struggle
on
the
strand
but
fridthjof
was
the
stronger
he
felled
his
foe
at
last
and
said
with
fiery
anger
his
knee
on
atle
breast
had
i
my
good
sword
ready
thou
berserk
blackbeard
now
thy
miserable
body
i
straightway
plunge
it
through
go
bring
it
who
prevent
thee
is
generous
atle
cry
and
if
it
will
content
thee
as
now
i
quiet
lie
why
should
it
make
me
sorrow
for
all
must
valhal
see
i
go
perhaps
thy
turn
will
be
then
fridthjof
quick
returning
desired
to
end
the
fray
raised
angervadil
burning
but
atle
quiet
lay
the
falling
blade
harmed
him
for
fridthjof
struck
the
sand
such
courage
had
disarmed
him
he
took
brave
atle
hand
with
gleeful
admonition
old
halvard
swung
his
staff
for
your
potation
there
nothing
here
to
quaff
upon
the
board
the
silver
dishes
glow
a
cold
meal
is
provoking
and
thirst
annoys
me
so
appeased
with
friendly
feeling
the
portals
they
pass
through
and
here
from
floor
to
ceiling
to
fridthjof
all
was
new
rough
planks
well
matched
together
lined
not
the
spacious
hall
but
golden
leather
was
stretched
along
the
wall
the
center
was
not
littered
by
mortared
hearthstone
wide
a
marble
fireplace
glittered
built
up
against

no

flitted
no

larded
the

graced
gold
bands
his
raised

guarded
with
flowers
his
horns
were
dressed
beside
each
champion
sitting
a
youthful
maiden
stood
an
evening
star
bright
flitting
behind
a
stormy
cloud
the
blue
eyes
beamed
in
showers
the
tresses
flowed
complete
as
sculptured
flowers
the
little
glowed
on
silver
stool
high
mounted
sat
angantyr
the
old
his
helm
shot
rays
uncounted
his
corselet
was
of
gold
his
mantle
rich
and
splendid
with
golden
stars
was
strewn
and
where
the
purple
ended
the
spotless
ermine
shone
three
steps
the
earl
descended
to
fridthjof
genially
he
said
with
hand
extended
come
higher
sit
by
me
of
horns
i
emptied
many
with
thorstein
in
his
day
his
son
more
famed
than
any
shall
not
sit
far
away
he
filled
each
goblet
brimming
with
wine
from
sicily
like
sparks
of
fire
was
gleaming
and
foaming
like
the
sea
welcome
exclaimed
the
speaker
my
friend
most
worthy
son
to
thorstein
fill
a
beaker
and
drink
now
every
one
now
woke
the
harpstring
slumbers
a
skald
from
morven
hills
in
gaul
melodious
numbers
sad
he
trills
but
thorstein
praise
was
chanted
in
old
norwayan
tongue
his
noble
deeds
were
vaunted
his
daring
valor
snug
the
earl
asked
much
concerning
his
friends
of
days
gone
by
in
words
replete
with
learning
young
fridthjof
made
reply
a
judgment
given
blindly
swift
accusation
brings
he
spoke
like
saga
kindly
remembering
holy
things
and
when
he
there
recounted
how
helge
goblins
sent
which
first
the
blue
waves
mounted
then
conquered
downward
went
the
champions
cheered
him
loudly
and
angantyr
the
same
in
high
approwd
proudly
they
echoed
fridthjof
name
but
when
he
spoke
in
anguish
of
in
her
bloom
how
she
was
left
to
languish
her
heart
with
grief
each
maiden
cheek
was
burning
each
bosom
sore
distressed
and
to
her
lover
turning
his
faithful
hand
she
pressed
his
embassy
to
mention
he
ventured
by
and
by
the
earl
gave
pleased
attention
and
then
he
made
reply
i
was
tributary
king
bele
health
maybe
to
drink
was
customary
but
from
his
law
we
free
his
sons
i
do
not
know
them
if
tribute
they
demand
custom
the
way
will
show
them
we
meet
them
on
the
strand
and
see
who
best
is
reckoned
but
thorstein
was
my
friend
his
daughter
then
he
beckoned
who
sat
quite
near
at
hand
then
rose
the
maiden
tender
from
stool
all
golden
bound
her
waist
is
trim
and
slender
her
bosom
full
and
round
each
dimpled
cheek
encloses
an
astrild
roguish
sprite
as
when
on
opening
roses
the
butterflies
alight
she
hastened
to
her
bower
a
green
silk
purse
she
brought
with
bird
and
tree
and
flower
and
beast
was
deftly
wrought
on
seas
were
vessels
beneath
the
silver
moon
of
gold
were
all
the
tassels
the
clasp
with
rubies
shone
she
placed
the
dainty
treasure
within
her
father
band
he
filled
it
brimming
measure
with
coin
from
foreign
land
this
welcome
gift
is
only
a
tribute
to
a
friend
and
now
the
winter
lonely
consent
with
us
to
spend
true
courage
knows
no
danger
but
heyd
and
ham
i
fear
revived
await
the
ranger
and
winter
storms
are
here
all
foes
the
deep
is
hiding
ellide
may
not
shun
and
many
whales
are
riding
the
waves
though
conquered
one
with
jesting
and
potation
the
hours
till
day
were
spent
without
inebriation
the
gladness
lent
a
brimming
skoal
was
given
to
angantyr
at
last
so
fridthjof
in
this
haven
the
cheerful
winter
passed
xii
the
return
now
spring
is
breathing
in
skies
of
blue
and
earth
her
carpet
has
woven
anew
and
fridthjof
grateful
his
kind
host
leaving
again
the
billowy
plain
is
cleaving
and
gayly
speeding
through
his
black
swan
ploweth
her
sunny
way
the
western
breezes
that
spring
is
bringing
like
nightingales
in
the
sails
are
singing
and
aeger
daughters
in
veils
of
blue
about
the
rudder
their
sports
pursue
ah
how
delightful
when
safely
clearing
a
foreign
land
to
be
homeward
steering
when
memory
pictures
the
smoke
that
curled
above
one
hearthstone
his
childhood
world
the
fount
where
playing
his
swift
feet
hurried
the
honored
graves
where
his
dead
are
buried
he
thinks
of
her
who
perchance
may
be
on
high
cliffs
standing
to
watch
the
sea
six
days
he
sailed
on
his
way
returning
the
seventh
a
strip
of
blue
discerning
low
down
the
horizon
he
neared
it
fast
saw
rock
and
islet
and
land
at
last
that
land
is
his
from
the
waves
advancing
he
sees
green
forests
in
sunlight
dancing
he
hears
the
roar
of
the
foaming
streams
can
trace
each
cliff
which
with
granite
gleams
salutes
the
headland
and
sound
then
glideth
along
by
the
groves
where
his
bideth
thinks
how
last
summer
each
evening
fair
with
her
beside
him
he
wandered
there
where
is
she
guesses
she
not
her
lover
is
near
her
safely
the
blue
waves
over
perhaps
removed
from
her
balder
care
she
strikes
the
harp
in
the
palace
where
her
grief
she
lessen
her
needle
plying
then
sudden
rises
his
falcon
flying
from
temple
turret
then
downward
flits
to
fridthjof
shoulder
and
there
he
sits
as
was
his
wont
of
his
love
to
assure
him
from
fridthjof
shoulder
can
none
allure
him
he
scratches
fast
with
his
claws
he
gives
no
quiet
he
makes
no
pause
to
fridthjof
ear
now
his
beak
he
bendeth
perchance
some
loved
one
a
message
sendeth
is
it
ingeborg
wildly
his
pulses
bound
but
none
interprets
the
broken
sound
ellide
gayly
the
headland
rounding
skips
lightly
on
like
a
roebuck
bounding
familiar
waters
surround
the
prow
where
happy
fridthjof
is
standing
now
he
rubs
his
eyes
and
his
hand
he
places
above
his
brow
to
discern
the
traces
of
home
so
dear
but
he
looks
in
vain
of
framness
ashes
alone
remain
the
naked
chimney
stands
lone
and
dreary
like
warriors
bones
of
their
weary
the
garden
place
is
a
blackened
floor
the
ashes
whirl
round
the
wasted
shore
in
bitter
mood
from
his
ship
he
hasteth
around
the
ruins
his
eyes
he
casteth
his
father
dwelling
his
childhood
pride
then
faithful
bran
with
the
shaggy
hide
comes
running
toward
him
each
moment
faster
of
forest
bears
had
he
oft
been
master
how
high
he
springs
in
his
gladsome
glee
how
leaps
with
pleasure
his
friend
to
see
the
steed
he
so
oft
had
ridden
comes
bounding
up
from
the
valley
hidden
with
neck
and
the
frame
of
a
hind
and
gold
mane
floating
upon
the
wind
he
curves
his
neck
and
he
stamps
while
standing
his
food
from
fridthjof
own
hand
demanding
but
fridthjof
poorer
by
far
than
they
has
nought
to
give
them
he
turns
away
unsheltered
sorrowful
stands
the
rover
he
looks
at
the
meadow
and
grove
burnt
over
of
hilding
coming
quite
unaware
his
with
silver
hair
at
what
i
see
i
can
scarcely
wonder
when
eagles
flit
then
their
nests
are
plunder
is
helge
deed
lest
the
land
be
wroth
so
well
he
keeps
his
crowning
oath
to
hate
mankind
and
to
gods
be
loyal
while
blackened
homes
mark
his
progress
royal
more
grief
it
gives
me
and
less
of
pain
but
where
does
my
ingeborg
meanwhile
remain
the
word
i
hear
hilding
said
in
sadness
i
fear
will
bring
you
but
little
gladness
you
scarce
had
sailed
when
king
ring
came
on
five
shields
i
counted
against
our
one
in
did
we
prove
our
valor
the
river
foamed
with
a
crimson
color
king
halfdan
jest
and
his
laugh
arose
so
too
the
sound
of
his
manly
blows
my
shield
i
held
as
a
buckler
him
well
pleased
with
fruits
his
bravery
bore
him
not
long
indeed
did
the
battle
last
king
helge
yielded
and
flying
fast
though
in
his
veins
was
welling
in
passing
framness
he
fired
the
dwelling
before
the
brothers
the
choice
was
placed
to
give
their
sister
to
ring
disgraced
by
her
alone
could
his
wrongs
be
righted
or
give
their
throne
for
his
offer
slighted
then
hither
and
thither
the
messengers
hied
but
now
has
ring
carried
home
his
bride
o
woman
woman
said
fridthjof
scorning
old
loke
thought
should
have
been
a
warning
his
thought
a
lie
was
in
woman
form
to
man
he
sent
it
his
heart
to
warm
a
lie
that
with
tears
alarms
us
forever
cheats
and
forever
charms
us
a
lie
with
bust
defined
of
virtue
and
faith
like
wind
from
out
whose
heart
folly
often
glances
on
whose
fresh
lips
basest
falsehood
dances
and
yet
how
dear
to
my
heart
was
she
and
dear
as
ever
she
still
must
be
my
wife
i
called
her
since
in
the
wildwood
we
played
together
in
happy
childhood
of
high
achievement
if
i
thought
her
love
alone
was
the
prize
i
sought
as
stems
which
grow
from
one
root
together
if
thor
strikes
one
then
they
both
will
wither
if
one
its
vesture
of
emerald
shows
the
other
mantles
with
green
its
boughs
our
lives
in
joy
and
in
grief
thus
blended
i
can
not
think
of
the
union
ended
but
i
alone
o
thou
noble
var
who
wanderest
over
the
earth
afar
to
record
on
gold
every
vow
that
spoken
forego
thy
pastime
the
vows
are
broken
the
tablet
filled
with
but
falsest
lies
the
faithful
gold
the
insult
cries
of
balder
nanna
i
oft
been
dreaming
but
truth
in
mortals
is
only
seeming
in
faithfulness
can
no
heart
rejoice
since
falsehood
borrows
my
ingeborg
voice
a
voice
like
wind
which
flower
fields
strayeth
or
music
when
brage
playeth
i
list
no
more
when
the
harp
is
tried
i
will
not
think
of
my
faithless
bride
where
storms
are
raging
there
will
i
follow
till
blood
thou
drinkest
thou
ocean
billow
where
swords
sow
seeds
for
pale
death
to
reap
on
mount
or
vale
i
my
vigil
keep
if
king
i
meet
and
to
combat
dare
him
i
smile
to
think
how
my
sword
shall
spare
him
but
if
in
battle
a
youth
i
meet
with
heart
enamored
and
visions
sweet
deluded
fool
who
on
faith
relieth
i
hew
him
down
the
vision
flyeth
will
kindly
slay
him
ere
yet
he
be
deceived
disgraced
and
betrayed
like
me
the
blood
that
youthful
no
boundaries
heedeth
old
hilding
said
how
much
it
needeth
the
cooling
touch
of
the
snows
of
age
you
wrong
the
maid
with
your
senseless
rage
my
beware
of
blaming
for
adverse
fortune
which
heaven
ordaining
the
wrathful
norns
upon
men
below
hurl
down
for
none
can
escape
the
blow
like
silent
vidar
no
outward
token
the
maiden
gave
that
her
heart
was
broken
her
grief
was
mute
as
in
southern
grove
the
voiceless
woe
of
the
widowed
dove
to
me
alone
who
her
childhood
guided
was
all
the
pain
she
endured
confided
as
dives
the
with
wounded
breast
lest
daylight
eye
should
upon
it
rest
and
there
remaineth
with
flowing
no
sign
of
weakness
or
misery
showing
so
she
in
darkness
her
suffering
bore
and
only
i
saw
her
anguish
sore
she
often
said
am
but
an
offering
for
bele
kingdom
who
talks
of
suffering
the
fragrant
with
leaf
and
vine
to
deck
the
victim
in
wreaths
they
twine
how
sweet
to
die
and
escape
from
anguish
but
no
in
pain
must
i
live
and
languish
for
balder
wrath
will
no
rest
allow
my
aching
heart
and
my
throbbing
brow
but
tell
to
no
one
my
secret
sorrow
i
rather
suffer
than
pity
borrow
king
bele
daughter
her
fate
may
dare
but
kindly
greeting
to
fridthjof
bear
the
wedding
day
with
its
footsteps
fateful
arrived
at
last
o
the
day
most
hateful
to
the
temple
marched
in
procession
sad
the
virgins
and
men
a
bard
dejected
the
train
was
guiding
the
pale
bride
followed
a
black
steed
riding
as
pale
was
she
as
the
wraith
which
sits
on
a
black
when
the
lightning
flits
from
off
the
saddle
i
quietly
took
her
nor
at
the
temple
door
forsook
her
but
led
her
up
to
the
altar
where
her
vows
she
uttered
in
accents
clear
she
wept
and
prayed
on
good
balder
calling
while
down
her
cheeks
were
the
falling
when
helge
saw
on
her
arm
your
band
he
tore
it
off
with
an
angry
hand
on
balder
image
now
hangs
the
jewel
my
wrath
burst
forth
at
this
act
so
cruel
my
sword
was
by
me
i
drew
it
forth
king
helge
then
was
but
little
worth
be
said
in
accents
broken
brother
might
surely
have
spared
this
token
how
much
one
suffers
ere
death
sets
free
the
allfather
judgeth
him
and
me
the
allfather
judgeth
said
fridthjof
slowly
i
too
would
give
him
my
judgment

wilt
thou

the

make
no

on
thy

never
sleep
in
a
house
for
a
foe
within
doors
you
may
view
on
his

sleeps
the

his

in
his
hand
and
his
tent
is

how
short
is
the
shaft
of
the
hammer
of
thor
but
an
ell
length
the
sword
blade
of
frey
enough
for
your

will
be
too
short
if
you
dare
near
the

hoist
the

to
the
top
o
how
merry
the
appears
let

let
her
drive
better
founder
than
strike
for
who
strikes
is
a
slave
to
his
fears
never
take
on
thy

the

she
freyja
herself
she
ensnare
for
the
dimples
she
wears
are
but
pitfalls
for
men
and
a
net
is
her
free
flowing
hair
wine
is
allfather
drink
and
the
cup
is
allowed
if
you
only
can
use
it
with
sense
he
who
falls
on
the

may
arise
who
falls
here
he
to
ran
the
goes
hence
if
a
merchant
sail
by
you
must
shelter
his
ship
but
the
weak
will
not
tribute
withhold
you
are
king
of
the
waves
he
a
slave
to
his
gains
and
your
steel
is
as
good
as
his
gold
let
your
goods
he
divided
by
lot
or
by
dice
how
it
falls
you
may
never
complain
but
the
himself
takes
no
part
in
the
lots
he
considers
the
honor
his
gain
if
a
come
there
is
grappling
and
strife
and
the
fight
the
shields
will
rejoice
if
you
yield
but
a

you
are
parted
from

is
the
law
you
may
act
by
your
choice
if
you
win
be
content
he
who
praying
for
peace
yields
his

is
no
longer
a
foe
prayer
a
hear
the
suppliant
voice
a
coward
who
answereth
no
wounds
are
viking
reward
and
the
pride
of
the
man
on
whose
breast
or
whose
forehead
they
stand
let
them
bleed
on
unbound
till
the
close
of
the
day
if
you
wish
to
be
one
of
our
band
thus
his
law
was
enrolled
and
his
name
every
day
through
all
foreign
coasts
grew
renowned
for
his
like
was
not
seen
on
the
sea
nor
the
valor
his
champions
crowned
then
he
sat
by
the
rudder
and
sullenly
gazed
in
the
depths
of
the
blue
rocking
tide
thou
art
deep
in
thy
depths
thriveth
peace
it
may
be
but
it
thriveth
not
here
where
we
ride
is
the
white
god
enraged
let
him
take
up
his
sword
i
will
fall
if
it
thus
is
designed
but
he
sits
in
the
skies
and
the
thoughts
he
sends
down
which
forever
are
clouding
my
mind
when
the
conflict
came
on
then
his
spirit
arose
like
an
eagle
refreshed
for
its
flight
and
his
brow
it
was
clear
and
his
voice
it
rang
high
like
the
thunderer
first
in
the
fight
so
from
conquest
to
conquest
unbroken
he
went
and
was
safe
the
high
foaming
grave
and
he
saw
in
the
south
many
islands
and
rocks
till
he
came
to
the
calm
grecian
wave
when
he
saw
the
green
groves
that
stand
out
from
the
waves
and
the
temple
before
him
uprose
what
he
thought
freyja
knows
and
the
poet
knows
too
and
the
lover
he
knows
ah
he
knows
here
we
ought
to
have
dwelt
here
the
island
and
grove
here
the
fane
as
my
father
set
forth
it
was
here
it
was
here
i
invited
my
love
but
the
cruel
one
staid
in
the
north
surely
peace
has
its
home
in
those
blissful
green
dales
in
the
colonnades
memory
words
like
the
whisper
of
love
are
the
murmuring
founts
and
a
the
voice
of
the
birds
where
is
ingeborg
now
hath
forgotten
me
quite
for
the
and
withered
old
king
i
can
never
forget
but
my
life
i
would
give
if
one
sight
of
my
love
it
would
bring
now
three
years
have
passed
by
since
the
land
i
beheld
where
heroic
achievement
prevails
tower
the
honored
mounts
yet
to
the
heavenly
blue
is
it
green
in
my

dales
on
the

where
my

is
laid
i

who
cares
for
the

thou

but
why
linger
i
longer
on
far
distant
waves
taking
tribute
and
striking
men
down
for
my
soul
but
despises
the
glittering
gold
and
gained
quite
enough
of
renown

it
points
to
the

king
ring
in
state
was
seated
at
drinking
mead
and
with
him
sat
his
consort
so
white
and
rosy
red
they
seemed
like
spring
and
autumn
when
both
together
seen
the
king
was
chilly
autumn
fresh
spring
the
fair
young
queen
a
man
unknown
there
entered
within
the
spacious
hall
from
head
to
foot
enveloped
a
covering
all
and
though
by
staff
supported
and
bent
with
age
and
care
he
stood
a
head
the
taller
than
any
champion
there
he
chose
for
seat
to
rest
him
a
bench
beside
the
door
now
the
poor
man
station
as
was
in
days
of
yore
the
courtiers
all
laughed
loudly
with
many
a
gibe
and
jest
and
with
the
finger
pointed
to
him
in
dressed
the
stranger
eyes
flashed
lightning
which
made
his
anger
felt
and
quick
a
young
man
seizing
with
one
hand
by
the
belt
both
up
and
down
he
turned
him
then
ceased
the
gleeful
din
for
all
the
rest

silent

i
had
been
what

an
uproar

many
questions

my
birthplace

misfortune
my
heritage
is
want
i
hither
came
but
lately
from
wolf
so
fierce
and
gaunt
in
youth
i
rode
a
dragon
upon
the
waters
blue
its
wings
were
stout
and
gayly
and
safely
too
it
flew
but
crippled
now
and
frozen
it
leaves
the
land
no
more
and
i
grown
old
and
weary
burn
salt
upon
the
shore
i
came
to
see
thy
wisdom
renowned
so
far
and
wide
and
when
they
met
me
rudely
for
scorn
i
not
abide
one
idiot
by
the
girdle
i
grasped
and
turned
him
round
for
that
i
beg
your
pardon
though
now

safe
and

words
are
wisely
chosen

must
agree

off
these
false
disguises
and
let
thy

and

ruleth
here
the
guest
now
loosed
the
bearskin
it
fell
from
off
his
head
where
stood
old
age
decrepit
each
saw
a
youth
instead
from
off
whose
noble
forehead
and
round
whose
shoulders
brave
the
light
locks
fell
and
floated
in
many
a
golden
wave
in
azure
velvet
mantle
he
then
stood
forth
erect
his
belt
a
silver
girdle
with
forest
beasts
bedecked
embossed
by
cunning
workman
each
figure
deftly
traced
and
round
and
round
the
hero
they
each
the
other
chased
a
massive
golden
circlet
his
sinewy
arm
displayed
his
hung
by
him
as
though
the
lightning
stayed
a
hero
glance
about
him
he
cast
from
time
to
time
and
stood
as
balder
beauteous
as
sublime
surprised
the
queen
cheeks
quickly
with
changing
color
glow
as
northern
lights
so
ruddy
paint
fields
of
driven
snow
as
two
twin
water
lilies
alarmed
by
tempest
swell
stand
swinging
on
the
billow
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
the
horn
a
shrill
blast
sounded
then
silence
reigned
throughout
the
hour
for
vows
was
coming
and
frey
boar
now
they
brought
his
mouth
contained
an
apple
wreaths
on
his
neck
were
laid
his
four
knees
bent
beneath
him
upon
a
silver
cade
king
ring
his
gray
locks
flowing
arose
and
now
the
boar
head
gently
touching
he
thus
declared
his
vow
i
swear
to
conquer
fridthjof
the
champion
in
war
so
help
me
frey
and
odin
and
likewise
mighty
thor
then
with
a
smile
defiant
uprose
the
stranger
tall
a
look
of
wrath
heroic
spread
his
features
all
he
smote
with
sword
the
table
till
through
the
hall
it
rang
and
up
from
oaken
benches
the
warriors
sprang
and
now
sir
king
please
listen
while
i
my
vow
shall
tell
young
fridthjof
is
my
kinsman
and
so
i
know
him
well
all
the
world
i
shield
him
i
give
you
here
my
word
so
help
me
now
my
norn
and
likewise
my
good
sword
the
king
then
laughed
right
daring
methinks
your
speech
said
he
but
in
this
northland
palace
shall
all
fair
words
be
free
my
queen
fill
him
a
bumper
of
wine
the
very
best
i
hope
that
through
the
winter
he
here
remain
our
guest
the
queen
then
took
the
goblet
before
her
it
was
placed
a
rare
and
costly
jewel
which
once
the
ure
head
graced
it
stood
on
feet
of
silver
and
on
its
golden
bands
were
runes
of
high
achievement
engraved
by
skillful
hands
with
downcast
eyes
she
reached
him
the
goblet
brimming
filled
but
with
a
hand
so
trembling
that
wine
thereon
was
spilled
as
evening
shades
so
ruddy
upon
the
lilies
glow
so
gleamed
the
drops
of
ruby
on
hand
as
white
as
snow
the
guest
the
horn
accepted
with
reverential
bow
not
two
men
could
have
drained
it
as
men
are
reckoned
now
without
an
instant
waiting
the
strong
man
at
a
draught
the
lovely
queen
to
honor
the
brimming
ruby
quaffed
the
skald
at
table
seated
his
waiting
harp
brought
forth
and
sang
a
heartfelt
story
of
true
love
in
the
north
of
hagbert
and
of
signe
and
at
the
deep
tones
peal
each
warrior
heart
was
melted
though
clad
his
breast
in
steel
he
sang
of
valhal
mansions
of
heroes
blest
reward
of
ancient
deeds
of
valor
on
fields
of
wave
and
sward
then
grasped
each
hand
its
then
flashed
each
eye
intent
and
quickly
round
the
table
the
foaming
went
and
lively
was
the
drinking
within
that
royal
hall
an
honest
yule
carousal
engaged
the
champions
all
the
sleep
that
followed
after
no

his

would
take
the

said
the
stranger
bold
it
may

and
the

is
too
deep
and
cold
the
king
answered
ring

not
easily
drowned
whoever
is
fearful
let
him
go
round
the
stranger
was
angered
and
sullen
frowned
then
quickly
his
skates
to
his
feet
he
bound
the
sets
out
he
is
strong
and
free
his
nostrils
are
flaming
so
glad

cried
the

as

passes
them
swiftly
whenever
he
will
he
writes
many
runes
on
the

besides
and
over
her

lovely
ingeborg
rides
they
swiftly
speed
onward
the
lake
to
span

under
them
lurketh
the
treacherous
ran
her
silvery
roof
in
a
trice
she
breaks
and
catches
the
sled
in
the
hole
she
makes
the
cheeks
of
the
beautiful
queen
turn
pale
then
comes
like
a
whirlwind
the
skater
in
mail
he
buries
his
skate
in
the
ice
to
clasp
the
steed
flowing

in

iron
grasp
with
one
single
effort
his

past
describing
flaps
its

about

and
like

wander
now
balder
precincts
i
remember
nor

the

they
my

thus
bewailed

soon
they
came
into
a
dark
and
lonesome
dell
gloomy
crowded
two
mountains
it
densest
shadows
fell
then
the
monarch
halted
saying
see
how
lovely
fresh
and
deep
i
am
weary
and
would
rest
me
fain
would
have
a
moment
sleep
sleep
not
here
for
hard
and
chilly
is
the
ground
o

indeed
up
thy
sleep

thee
let
me
back
the

lead
like

sleep

does
my

said
the
king
with
feeble
accents
grudge
his
host
a
moment
rest
fridthjof
then
took
off
his
mantle
and
outspread
it
a
tree
and
the
king
in
trusting
friendship
laid
his
head
on
fridthjof
knee
soon
he
slept
as
sleeps
the
hero
after
battle
rude
alarms
on
his
shield
or
as
an
infant
cradled
in
his
mother
arms
as
he
slumbers
hark
there
singeth
from
a
branch
a
bird
hasten
fridthjof
slay
the

by

stirred
take
the
queen
she
thine
by

thee
the
bridal
kiss
she
gave
human
eyes
do
not
behold
thee
deep
and
silent
is
the
grave
fridthjof
listens
hark
there
singeth
from

a

though
no

behold
thee

wilt

so
sang
both
the
birds
but
fridthjof
snatching
up

flung
it
from
him
with
a
shudder
far
into
the
gloomy
glade
flew
away
to

airily
the

singing
sweetly
as

the
reconciliation
completed
now
was
balder
temple
not
enclosed
as
heretofore
with
fence
of
wood
of
hammered
steel
with
golden
knobs
upon
each
bar
was
built
the
fence
round
balder
ground
like
champions
ranged
for
war
with
halberds
and
with
golden
helms
there
stood
it
now
on
guard
around
the
sanctuary
of
the
god
of
giant
stones
alone
the
massive
wall
was
built
and
joined
with
active
skill
a
noble
giant
work
for
all
eternity
as
is
upsala
shrine
where
norseland
saw
its
valhal
in
an
earthly
mold
it
stood
there
in
its
grandeur
on
the
mountain
cliff
and
mirrored
in
the
ocean
wave
its
lofty
brow
while
round
about
it
like
a
zone
of
beauteous
flowers
far
stretched
the
dale
of
balder
with
its
sighing
groves
its
song
of
birds
a
home
where
peace
might
reign
supreme
high
rose
the
portal
and
within
two
colonnades
supported
on
strong
omoplates
the
vaulted
canopy
and
beautiful
it
hung
above
the
temple
like
a
concave
shield
of
gold
at
farthest
end
stood
balder
altar
it
was
hewn
from
one
huge
block
of
northern
granite
round
it
coiled
a
graven
serpent
covered
with
written
runes
profoundest
thoughts
from
vala
and
from
but
in
the
wall
above
was
left
an
open
space
a
dark
blue
ground
all
filled
with
golden
stars
and
there
a
silver
image
sat
the
pious
god
as
calm
and
mild
as
sits
the
silver
moon
in
heaven
blue
thus
seemed
the
finished
shrine
in
couples
entered
now
twelve
temple
virgins
clad
in
robes
of
silver
gauze
with
roses
glowing
on
their
cheeks
and
roses
in
their
guileless
hearts
before
the
image
of
the
god
around
the
altar
newly
consecrate
they
danced
as
light
spring
winds
above
the
flowing
fountains
flit
as
dance
the
forest
elves
amid
the
waving
grass
while
yet
the
morning
dew
like
pearls
lies
glittering
there
and
while
they
danced
they
joyful
sang
a
sacred
song
of
pious
balder
and
how
dearly
he
was
loved
by
every
being
how
he
fell
hoder
dart
and
earth
and
sea
and
heaven
wept
yet
sounded
not
the
song
as
though
uttered
by
a
human
voice
but
as
a
tone
from
breidablik
from
balder
home
or
like
the
thought
of
lover
to
a
lonely
maid
when
pipes
the
quail
his
deep
notes
in
the
hush
of
night
and
over
northern
birches
falls
the
moonlight
soft
enraptured
fridthjof
stood
he
leaned
upon
his
sword
and
gazed
upon
the
dance
sweet
childhood
memories
thronged
his
vision
by
an
innocent
and
pleasant
folk
with
smiling
eyes
reflecting
heaven
blue
with
heads
surrounded
hy
a
halo
of
bright
locks
they
waved
a
kindly
salutation
to
their
childhood
friend
then
sank
the
bloody
shadow
of
his
viking
life
with
all
its
conflicts
all
its
perilous
exploits
down
into
night
and
in
his
fancy
stood
he
forth
a
monument
above
their
grave
and
ever
as
the
song
increased
his
spirit
soared
from
earthly
dales
below
to
valaskjalf
above
then
melted
human
hate
and
human
vengeance
too
as
melts
the
icy
coat
of
mail
from
off
the
cliff
when
shines
the
sun
in

the

of

balder
priest
most
high
not
young
and
beauteous
as

but
tall
in
form
with
heavenly
mildness
beaming
in
his
noble
face
while
down
about
his
girdle
flowed
his
silver
beard
an
unused
reverence
possessed
proud
fridthjof
heart
the
eagle
wings
upon

helmet
meekly
drooped
before
the
aged
man

thus
spoke

son
fridthjof
welcome
hither
i

thee
the
strong
man
gladly
roves
around

who
pallid
bites

hard
edge

weary
grown
and
thoughtful
wanders
home
at

thor
went
many

spite
his
belt
divine
and

of

steel
still
sits
the
on

lofty
throne
for
evil
is
itself
a
power
and
will
not
yield
and
piety
not
joined
with

is
children
play
like
the
sunbeams
on

breast
of
aeger
thrown
an
image
faint
which
falls
and
rises
with
the

foundationless
and
insecure
devoid

power
not
joined

eats
itself
away
as

unchecked

the
heron
of
oblivion

when

wakes

blushes
for

all
power
is
from
the
earth
of
ymer
body
formed
wild
waves
and
flowing
waters
are
the
veins
therein
from
various

are
its
tough
strong
sinews
forged

is
empty
desolate
unfruitful
till
the

piety
sends
down
then
spring
the

of

up

crown

golden

thus
with

opposing

when

balance
true

heavenly

the

half
extinguished
when
the

fell
the

then
withered
on
the

its

among

on

there
stood
an

built
abandoned
long

the

was
now
fast
closed

just
above
the

still
there
stood
a
strange
old
image
of
the
god
now
tottering
to
its
fall
but
no
one
dare
approach
for
there
a
saying
rife
among
the
people
went
from
age
to
age
that
he
who
first
the
temple
sought
should
jumala
behold
this
helge
heard
and
blinded
by
his
furious
wrath
went
up
the
ruined
steps
against
the
hated
god
intent
to
cast
the
temple
down
when
there
arrived
the
gate
was
closed
the
key
fast
rusted
in

lock
then
grasping
both
the
hard
and
fierce
he
shook
the
rotten
pillars
all
at
once
with
horrid
crash
down
fell
the
ponderous
image
crushing
in
its
fall
the
and
thus
he

beheld

last
