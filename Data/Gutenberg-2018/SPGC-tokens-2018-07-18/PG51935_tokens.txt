introduction
nietzsche
essay
wagner
in
bayreuth
appeared
in
and
his
next
publication
was
his
present
work
which
was
issued
in
a
comparison
of
the
books
will
show
that
the
two
years
of
meditation
intervening
had
brought
about
a
great
change
in
views
his
style
of
expressing
them
and
the
form
in
which
they
were
cast
the
dionysian
overflowing
with
life
gives
way
to
an
apollonian
thinker
with
a
touch
of
pessimism
the
long
essay
form
is
abandoned
and
instead
we
have
a
series
of
aphorisms
some
tinged
with
melancholy
others
with
satire
several
especially
towards
the
end
with
nietzschian
wit
at
its
best
and
a
few
at
the
beginning
so
very
abstruse
as
to
require
careful
study
since
the
bayreuth
festivals
of
nietzsche
had
gradually
come
to
see
wagner
as
he
really
was
the
ideal
musician
that
nietzsche
had
pictured
in
his
own
mind
turned
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
rather
dilettante
philosopher
an
opportunistic
decadent
with
a
suspicious
tendency
towards
christianity
the
young
philosopher
thereupon
proceeded
to
shake
off
the
influence
which
the
musician
had
exercised
upon
him
he
was
successful
in
doing
so
but
not
without
a
struggle
just
as
he
had
formerly
shaken
off
the
influence
of
schopenhauer
hence
he
writes
in
his
autobiography
is
the
monument
of
a
crisis
it
is
entitled
book
for
spirits
and
almost
every
line
in
it
represents
a
victory
in
its
pages
i
freed
myself
from
everything
foreign
to
my
real
nature
idealism
is
foreign
to
me
the
title
says
see
ideal
things
i
see
things
which
are
only
human
alas
i
know
man
the
term
spirit
must
here
be
understood
in
no
other
sense
than
this
a
man
who
has
once
more
taken
possession
of
himself
the
form
of
this
book
will
be
better
understood
when
it
is
remembered
that
at
this
period
nietzsche
was
beginning
to
suffer
from
stomach
trouble
and
headaches
as
a
cure
for
his
complaints
he
spent
his
time
in
travel
when
he
could
get
a
few
weeks
respite
from
his
duties
at
basel
university
and
it
was
in
the
course
of
his
solitary
walks
and
tours
that
the
majority
of
these
thoughts
occurred
to
him
and
were
jotted
down
there
and
then
a
few
of
them
however
date
further
back
as
he
tells
us
in
the
preface
to
the
second
part
of
this
work
many
of
them
he
says
occupied
his
mind
even
before
he
published
his
first
book
birth
of
and
several
others
as
we
learn
from
his
notebooks
and
posthumous
writings
date
from
the
period
of
the
out
of
it
must
be
clearly
understood
however
that
nietzsche
disease
must
not
be
looked
upon
in
the
same
way
as
that
of
an
ordinary
man
people
are
inclined
to
regard
a
sick
man
as
rancorous
but
any
one
who
rights
with
and
conquers
his
disease
and
even
exploits
it
as
nietzsche
did
benefits
thereby
to
an
extraordinary
degree
in
the
first
place
he
has
passed
through
several
stages
of
human
psychology
with
which
a
healthy
man
is
entirely
unacquainted
he
has
learnt
by
introspection
the
spiteful
and
revengeful
spirit
of
the
sick
man
and
his
religion
secondly
in
his
moments
of
freedom
from
pain
and
gloom
his
thoughts
will
be
all
the
more
brilliant
in
support
of
this
last
statement
one
instance
may
be
selected
out
of
hundreds
that
could
be
adduced
heinrich
heine
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
exile
from
his
native
country
tortured
by
headaches
and
finally
dying
in
a
foreign
land
as
the
result
of
a
spinal
disease
his
splendid
works
were
composed
in
his
moments
of
respite
from
illness
and
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
when
his
health
was
at
its
worst
he
gave
to
the
world
his
famous
we
would
likewise
do
well
to
recollect
goethe
saying
zart
gedicht
wie
regenbogen
wird
nur
auf
dunkelm
grund
gezogen
thus
neither
the
form
of
this
book
so
startling
at
first
to
those
who
have
been
brought
up
in
the
traditions
of
our
own
school
nor
the
treat
all
men
as
equals
and
proclaim
the
establishment
of
equal
rights
so
far
a
socialistic
mode
of
thought
which
is
based
on
is
possible
but
as
has
been
said
only
within
the
ranks
of
the
governing
classes
which
in
this
case
justice
with
sacrifices
and
abnegations
on
the
other
hand
to
equality
of
rights
as
do
the
socialists
of
the
subject
caste
is
by
no
means
the
outcome
of
justice
but
of
covetousness
if
you
expose
bloody
pieces
of
flesh
to
a
beast
and
then
withdraw
them
again
until
it
finally
begins
to
roar
do
you
think
that
the
roaring
implies
justice
theologians
on
the
other
hand
as
may
be
expected
will
find
no
such
ready
help
in
their
difficulties
from
nietzsche
they
must
on
the
contrary
be
on
their
guard
against
so
alert
an
adversary
a
duty
which
they
are
apparently
not
going
to
shirk
for
theologians
are
amongst
the
most
ardent
students
of
nietzsche
in
this
country
their
attention
may
therefore
be
drawn
to
aphorism
of
this
book
dealing
with
convictions
and
their
origin
which
will
no
doubt
be
successfully
refuted
by
the
defenders
of
the
true
faith
in
fact
there
is
not
a
single
paragraph
in
the
book
that
does
not
deserve
careful
study
by
all
serious
thinkers
on
the
whole
however
this
is
a
calm
book
and
those
who
are
accustomed
to
nietzsche
the
immoralist
may
be
somewhat
astonished
at
the
calm
tone
of
the
present
volume
the
explanation
is
that
nietzsche
was
now
just
beginning
to
walk
on
his
own
philosophical
path
his
aim
the
uplifting
of
the
type
man
was
still
in
view
but
the
way
leading
towards
it
was
once
more
uncertain
hence
the
peculiarly
calm
even
melancholic
and
what
nietzsche
himself
would
call
apollonian
tinge
of
many
of
these
aphorisms
so
different
from
the
style
of
his
earlier
and
later
writings
for
this
very
reason
however
the
book
may
appeal
all
the
more
to
english
readers
who
are
of
course
more
apollonian
than
dionysian
nietzsche
is
feeling
his
way
and
these
aphorisms
represent
his
first
steps
as
such
besides
having
a
high
intrinsic
value
of
themselves
they
are
enormous
aids
to
the
study
of
his
character
and
temperament

tender
poetry
like
rainbows
can
appear
only
on
a
dark
and
sombre
preface
i
have
been
told
frequently
and
always
with
great
surprise
that
there
is
something
common
and
distinctive
in
all
my
writings
from
the
of
to
the
latest
published
to
a
philosophy
of
the
they
all
contain
i
have
been
told
snares
and
nets
for
unwary
birds
and
an
almost
perpetual
unconscious
demand
for
the
inversion
of
customary
valuations
and
valued
customs
what
only
people
lay
down
my
writings
with
this
sigh
not
without
a
certain
dread
and
distrust
of
morality
itself
indeed
almost
tempted
and
encouraged
to
become
advocates
of
the
things
as
being
perhaps
only
the
disparaged
my
writings
have
been
called
a
school
of
suspicion
and
especially
of
disdain
more
happily
also
a
school
of
courage
and
even
of
audacity
indeed
i
myself
do
not
think
that
any
one
has
ever
looked
at
the
world
with
such
a
profound
suspicion
and
not
only
as
occasional
devil
advocate
but
equally
also
to
speak
theologically
as
enemy
and
impeacher
of
god
and
he
who
realises
something
of
the
consequences
involved
in
every
profound
suspicion
something
of
the
chills
and
anxieties
of
loneliness
to
which
every
uncompromising
of
condemns
him
who
is
affected
therewith
will
also
understand
how
often
i
sought
shelter
in
some
kind
of
reverence
or
hostility
or
scientificality
or
levity
or
stupidity
in
order
to
recover
from
myself
and
as
it
were
to
obtain
temporary
also
why
when
i
did
not
find
what
i
i
was
obliged
to
manufacture
it
to
counterfeit
and
to
imagine
it
in
a
suitable
manner
and
what
else
have
poets
ever
done
and
for
what
purpose
has
all
the
art
in
the
world
existed
what
i
always
required
most
however
for
my
cure
and
was
the
belief
that
i
was
isolated
in
such
circumstances
that
i
did
not
in
an
isolated
manner
a
magic
suspicion
of
relationship
and
similarity
to
others
in
outlook
and
desire
a
repose
in
the
confidence
of
friendship
a
blindness
in
both
parties
without
suspicion
or
note
of
interrogation
an
enjoyment
of
foregrounds
and
surfaces
of
the
near
and
the
nearest
of
all
that
has
colour
epidermis
and
outside
appearance
perhaps
i
might
be
reproached
in
this
respect
for
much
art
and
fine
false
coinage
for
instance
for
voluntarily
and
knowingly
shutting
my
eyes
to
schopenhauer
blind
will
to
morality
at
a
time
when
i
had
become
sufficiently
about
morality
also
for
deceiving
myself
about
richard
wagner
incurable
romanticism
as
if
it
were
a
beginning
and
not
an
end
also
about
the
greeks
also
about
the
germans
and
their
future
and
there
would
still
probably
be
quite
a
long
list
of
such
alsos
supposing
however
that
this
were
all
true
and
that
i
were
reproached
with
good
reason
what
do
know
what
you
know
as
to
how
much
artifice
of
how
much
rationality
and
higher
protection
there
is
in
such
and
how
much
falseness
i
still
in
order
to
allow
myself
again
and
again
the
luxury
of
sincerity
in
short
i
still
live
and
life
in
spite
of
ourselves
is
not
devised
by
morality
it
illusion
it
by
illusion
but
there
i
am
already
beginning
again
and
doing
what
i
have
always
done
old
immoralist
and
that
i
am
i
am
talking
beyond
good
and
evil
thus
then
when
i
found
it
necessary
i
once
on
a
time
the
free
spirits
to
whom
this
discouragingly
encouraging
book
with
the
title
is
dedicated
there
are
no
such
free
spirits
nor
have
there
been
such
but
as
already
said
i
then
required
them
for
company
to
keep
me
cheerful
in
the
midst
of
evils
sickness
loneliness
foreignness
inactivity
as
brave
companions
and
ghosts
with
whom
i
could
laugh
and
gossip
when
so
inclined
and
send
to
the
devil
when
they
became
bores
as
compensation
for
the
lack
of
friends
that
such
free
spirits
be
some
day
that
our
europe
have
such
bold
and
cheerful
wights
amongst
her
sons
of
and
the
day
after
as
the
shadows
of
a
hermit
phantasmagoria
should
be
the
last
to
doubt
thereof
already
i
see
them
slowly
slowly
and
perhaps
i
am
doing
something
to
hasten
their
coming
when
i
describe
in
advance
under
what
auspices
i
them
originate
and
upon
what
paths
i
them
come
one
may
suppose
that
a
spirit
in
which
the
type
free
spirit
is
to
become
fully
mature
and
sweet
has
had
its
decisive
event
in
a
emancipation
and
that
it
was
all
the
more
fettered
previously
and
apparently
bound
for
ever
to
its
corner
and
pillar
what
is
it
that
binds
most
strongly
what
cords
are
almost
unrendable
in
men
of
a
lofty
and
select
type
it
will
be
their
duties
the
reverence
which
is
suitable
to
youth
respect
and
tenderness
for
all
that
is
and
worthy
gratitude
to
the
land
which
bore
them
to
the
hand
which
led
them
to
the
sanctuary
where
they
learnt
to
adore
their
most
exalted
moments
themselves
will
bind
them
most
effectively
will
lay
upon
them
the
most
enduring
obligations
for
those
who
are
thus
bound
the
great
emancipation
comes
suddenly
like
an
earthquake
the
young
soul
is
all
at
once
convulsed
unloosened
and
extricated
it
does
not
itself
know
what
is
happening
an
impulsion
sway
and
it
like
a
command
a
will
and
a
wish
awaken
to
go
forth
on
their
course
anywhere
at
any
cost
a
violent
dangerous
curiosity
about
an
undiscovered
world
flames
and
flares
in
every
sense
better
to
die
than
live
says
the
imperious
voice
and
seduction
and
this
here
this
at
home
is
all
that
the
soul
has
hitherto
loved
a
sudden
fear
and
suspicion
of
that
which
it
loved
a
flash
of
disdain
for
what
was
called
its
duty
a
rebellious
arbitrary
volcanically
throbbing
longing
for
travel
foreignness
estrangement
coldness
disenchantment
glaciation
a
hatred
of
love
perhaps
a
sacrilegious
clutch
and
look
to
where
it
hitherto
adored
and
loved
perhaps
a
glow
of
shame
at
what
it
was
just
doing
and
at
the
same
time
a
rejoicing
it
was
doing
it
an
intoxicated
internal
exulting
thrill
which
betrays
a
triumph
a
triumph
over
what
over
whom
an
enigmatical
questionable
doubtful
triumph
but
the
triumph
nevertheless
such
evil
and
painful
incidents
belong
to
the
history
of
the
great
emancipation
it
is
at
the
same
time
a
disease
which
may
destroy
the
man
this
first
outbreak
of
power
and
will
to
this
will
to
will
and
how
much
disease
is
manifested
in
the
wild
attempts
and
eccentricities
by
which
the
liberated
and
emancipated
one
now
seeks
to
demonstrate
his
mastery
over
things
he
roves
about
raging
with
unsatisfied
longing
whatever
he
captures
has
to
suffer
for
the
dangerous
tension
of
his
pride
he
tears
to
pieces
whatever
attracts
him
with
a
malicious
laugh
he
twirls
round
whatever
he
finds
veiled
or
guarded
by
a
sense
of
shame
he
tries
how
these
things
look
when
turned
upside
down
it
is
a
matter
of
arbitrariness
with
him
and
pleasure
in
arbitrariness
if
he
now
perhaps
bestow
his
favour
on
what
had
hitherto
a
bad
repute
if
he
inquisitively
and
temptingly
haunt
what
is
specially
forbidden
in
the
background
of
his
activities
and
wanderings
for
he
is
restless
and
aimless
in
his
course
as
in
a
desert
stands
the
note
of
interrogation
of
an
increasingly
dangerous
curiosity
can
not
valuations
be
reversed
and
is
good
perhaps
evil
and
god
only
an
invention
and
artifice
of
the
devil
is
everything
perhaps
radically
false
and
if
we
are
the
deceived
are
we
not
thereby
also
deceivers
we
not
also
be
deceivers
such
thoughts
lead
and
mislead
him
more
and
more
onward
and
away
solitude
encircles
and
engirdles
him
always
more
threatening
more
throttling
more
that
terrible
goddess
and
sæva
but
who
knows
nowadays
what
is
from
this
morbid
solitariness
from
the
desert
of
such
years
of
experiment
it
is
still
a
long
way
to
the
copious
overflowing
safety
and
soundness
which
does
not
care
to
dispense
with
disease
itself
as
an
instrument
and
of
knowledge
to
that
freedom
of
spirit
which
is
equally
and
discipline
of
the
heart
and
gives
access
to
many
and
opposed
modes
of
thought
to
that
inward
comprehensiveness
and
daintiness
of
superabundance
which
excludes
any
danger
of
the
spirit
becoming
enamoured
and
lost
in
its
own
paths
and
lying
intoxicated
in
some
corner
or
other
to
that
excess
of
plastic
healing
formative
and
restorative
powers
which
is
exactly
the
sign
of
health
that
excess
which
gives
the
free
spirit
the
dangerous
prerogative
of
being
entitled
to
live
by
and
offer
itself
to
adventure
the
free
spirit
prerogative
of
mastership
long
years
of
convalescence
may
lie
in
between
years
full
of
magical
transformations
curbed
and
led
by
a
tough
to
health
which
often
dares
to
dress
and
disguise
itself
as
actual
health
there
is
a
middle
condition
therein
which
a
man
of
such
a
fate
never
calls
to
mind
later
on
without
emotion
a
pale
delicate
light
and
a
are
peculiar
to
him
a
feeling
of
freedom
prospect
and
haughtiness
a
in
which
curiosity
and
gentle
disdain
are
combined
a
free
spirit
this
cool
expression
does
good
in
every
condition
it
almost
warms
one
no
longer
lives
in
the
fetters
of
love
and
hatred
without
yea
without
nay
voluntarily
near
voluntarily
distant
preferring
to
escape
to
turn
aside
to
flutter
forth
to
fly
up
and
away
one
is
fastidious
like
every
one
who
has
once
seen
an
immense
variety
him
and
one
has
become
the
opposite
of
those
who
trouble
themselves
about
things
which
do
not
concern
them
in
fact
it
is
nothing
but
things
which
now
concern
the
free
spirit
and
how
many
things
which
no
longer
him
a
step
further
towards
recovery
and
the
free
spirit
again
draws
near
to
life
slowly
it
is
true
and
almost
stubbornly
almost
distrustfully
again
it
grows
warmer
around
him
and
as
it
were
yellower
feeling
and
sympathy
gain
depth
thawing
winds
of
every
kind
pass
lightly
over
him
he
almost
feels
as
if
his
eyes
were
now
first
opened
to
what
is
he
marvels
and
is
still
where
has
he
been
the
near
and
nearest
things
how
changed
they
appear
to
him
what
a
bloom
and
magic
they
have
acquired
meanwhile
he
looks
back
gratefully
grateful
to
his
wandering
his
austerity
and
his
and
his
flights
in
cold
heights
what
a
good
thing
that
he
did
not
always
stay
at
home
by
himself
like
a
sensitive
stupid
tenderling
he
has
been
himself
there
is
no
doubt
he
now
sees
himself
for
the
first
time
and
what
surprises
he
feels
thereby
what
thrills
unexperienced
hitherto
what
joy
even
in
the
weariness
in
the
old
illness
in
the
relapses
of
the
convalescent
how
he
likes
to
sit
still
and
suffer
to
practise
patience
to
lie
in
the
sun
who
is
as
familiar
as
he
with
the
joy
of
winter
with
the
patch
of
sunshine
upon
the
wall
they
are
the
most
grateful
animals
in
the
world
and
also
the
most
unassuming
these
lizards
of
convalescents
with
their
faces
towards
life
once
more
there
are
those
amongst
them
who
never
let
a
day
pass
without
hanging
a
little
hymn
of
praise
on
its
trailing
fringe
and
speaking
seriously
it
is
a
radical
for
all
pessimism
the
disease
of
old
idealists
and
to
become
ill
after
the
manner
of
these
free
spirits
to
remain
ill
a
good
while
and
then
grow
well
i
mean
better
for
a
still
longer
period
it
is
wisdom
practical
wisdom
to
prescribe
even
health
for
one
self
for
a
long
time
only
in
small
doses
about
this
time
it
may
at
last
happen
under
the
sudden
illuminations
of
still
disturbed
and
changing
health
that
the
enigma
of
that
great
emancipation
begins
to
reveal
itself
to
the
free
and
ever
freer
spirit
that
enigma
which
had
hitherto
lain
obscure
questionable
and
almost
intangible
in
his
memory
if
for
a
long
time
he
scarcely
dared
to
ask
himself
why
so
apart
so
alone
denying
everything
that
i
revered
denying
reverence
itself
why
this
hatred
this
suspicion
this
severity
towards
my
own
virtues
he
now
dares
and
asks
the
questions
aloud
and
already
hears
something
like
an
answer
to
them
thou
shouldst
become
master
over
thyself
and
master
also
of
thine
own
virtues
formerly
were
thy
masters
but
they
are
only
entitled
to
be
thy
tools
amongst
other
tools
thou
shouldst
obtain
power
over
thy
pro
and
contra
and
learn
how
to
put
them
forth
and
withdraw
them
again
in
accordance
with
thy
higher
purpose
thou
shouldst
learn
how
to
take
the
proper
perspective
of
every
valuation
the
shifting
distortion
and
apparent
teleology
of
the
horizons
and
everything
that
belongs
to
perspective
also
the
amount
of
stupidity
which
opposite
values
involve
and
all
the
intellectual
loss
with
which
every
pro
and
every
contra
has
to
be
paid
for
thou
shouldst
learn
how
much
injustice
there
is
in
every
for
and
against
injustice
as
inseparable
from
life
and
life
itself
as
by
the
perspective
and
its
injustice
above
all
thou
shouldst
see
clearly
where
the
injustice
is
always
greatest
namely
where
life
has
developed
most
punily
restrictedly
necessitously
and
incipiently
and
yet
can
not
help
regarding
as
the
purpose
and
standard
of
things
and
for
the
sake
of
secretly
basely
and
continuously
wasting
away
and
calling
in
question
the
higher
greater
and
richer
thou
shouldst
see
clearly
the
problem
of
gradation
of
rank
and
how
power
and
right
and
amplitude
of
perspective
grow
up
together
thou
shouldst
but
enough
the
free
spirit
henceforth
which
thou
shalt
he
has
obeyed
and
also
what
he
now
what
he
only
now
thus
doth
the
free
spirit
answer
himself
with
regard
to
the
riddle
of
emancipation
and
ends
therewith
while
he
generalises
his
case
in
order
thus
to
decide
with
regard
to
his
experience
as
it
has
happened
to
he
says
to
himself
so
must
it
happen
to
every
one
in
whom
a
seeks
to
embody
itself
and
to
into
the
world
the
secret
power
and
necessity
of
this
mission
will
operate
in
and
upon
the
destined
individuals
like
an
unconscious
pregnancy
long
before
they
have
had
the
mission
itself
in
view
and
have
known
its
name
our
destiny
rules
over
us
even
when
we
are
not
yet
aware
of
it
it
is
the
future
that
makes
laws
for
our
granted
that
it
is
problem
of
the
gradations
of
rank
of
which
we
may
say
that
it
is
problem
we
free
spirits
now
only
in
the
midday
of
our
life
do
we
first
understand
what
preparations
detours
tests
experiments
and
disguises
the
problem
needed
before
it
to
rise
before
us
and
how
we
had
first
to
experience
the
most
manifold
and
opposing
conditions
of
distress
and
happiness
in
soul
and
body
as
adventurers
and
circumnavigators
of
the
inner
world
called
man
as
surveyors
of
all
the
higher
and
the
also
called
man
penetrating
everywhere
almost
without
fear
rejecting
nothing
losing
nothing
tasting
everything
cleansing
everything
from
all
that
is
accidental
and
as
it
were
sifting
it
out
until
at
last
we
could
say
we
free
spirits
here
a
problem
here
a
long
ladder
the
rungs
of
which
we
ourselves
have
sat
upon
and
mounted
which
we
ourselves
at
some
time
have
here
a
higher
place
a
lower
place
an
an
immeasurably
long
order
a
hierarchy
which
we
here
problem
no
psychologist
or
augur
will
be
in
doubt
for
a
moment
as
to
what
stage
of
the
development
just
described
the
following
book
belongs
or
is
assigned
to
but
where
are
these
psychologists
nowadays
in
france
certainly
perhaps
in
russia
assuredly
not
in
germany
reasons
are
not
lacking
why
the
germans
could
still
even
count
this
as
an
honour
to
them
bad
enough
surely
for
one
who
in
this
respect
is
in
disposition
and
constitution
this
book
which
has
been
able
to
find
readers
in
a
wide
circle
of
countries
and
nations
it
has
been
about
ten
years
going
its
rounds
and
must
understand
some
sort
of
music
and
piping
art
by
means
of
which
even
coy
foreign
ears
are
seduced
into
listening
it
is
precisely
in
germany
that
this
book
has
been
most
negligently
read
and
worst
to
what
is
the
reason
it
demands
too
much
i
have
been
told
it
appeals
to
men
free
from
the
pressure
of
coarse
duties
it
wants
refined
and
fastidious
senses
it
needs
superfluity
superfluity
of
time
of
clearness
of
sky
and
heart
of
in
the
boldest
sense
of
the
term
purely
good
things
which
we
germans
of
do
not
possess
and
therefore
can
not
give
after
such
a
polite
answer
my
philosophy
advises
me
to
be
silent
and
not
to
question
further
besides
in
certain
cases
as
the
proverb
points
out
one
only
a
philosopher
by
being
silent
nice
footnote
an
allusion
to
the
mediæval
latin
distich
o
si
tacuisses
philosophus
human
first
division
first
and
last
things
chemistry
of
ideas
and
philosophical
problems
adopt
in
almost
all
matters
the
same
form
of
question
as
they
did
two
thousand
years
ago
how
can
anything
spring
from
its
opposite
for
instance
reason
out
of
unreason
the
sentient
out
of
the
dead
logic
out
of
unlogic
disinterested
contemplation
out
of
covetous
willing
life
for
others
out
of
egoism
truth
out
of
error
metaphysical
philosophy
has
helped
itself
over
those
difficulties
hitherto
by
denying
the
origin
of
one
thing
in
another
and
assuming
a
miraculous
origin
for
more
highly
valued
things
immediately
out
of
the
kernel
and
essence
of
the
thing
in
itself
historical
philosophy
on
the
contrary
which
is
no
longer
to
be
thought
of
as
separate
from
physical
science
the
youngest
of
all
philosophical
methods
has
ascertained
in
single
cases
and
presumably
this
will
happen
in
everything
that
there
are
no
opposites
except
in
the
usual
exaggeration
of
the
popular
or
metaphysical
point
of
view
and
that
an
error
of
reason
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
opposition
according
to
this
explanation
strictly
understood
there
is
neither
an
unegoistical
action
nor
an
entirely
disinterested
point
of
view
they
are
both
only
sublimations
in
which
the
fundamental
element
appears
almost
evaporated
and
is
only
to
be
discovered
by
the
closest
observation
all
that
we
require
and
which
can
only
be
given
us
by
the
present
advance
of
the
single
sciences
is
a
of
the
moral
religious
æsthetic
ideas
and
sentiments
as
also
of
those
emotions
which
we
experience
in
ourselves
both
in
the
great
and
in
the
small
phases
of
social
and
intellectual
intercourse
and
even
in
solitude
but
what
if
this
chemistry
should
result
in
the
fact
that
also
in
this
case
the
most
beautiful
colours
have
been
obtained
from
base
even
despised
materials
would
many
be
inclined
to
pursue
such
examinations
humanity
likes
to
put
all
questions
as
to
origin
and
beginning
out
of
its
mind
must
one
not
be
almost
dehumanised
to
feel
a
contrary
tendency
in
one
self
inherited
faults
of
all
philosophers
have
the
common
fault
that
they
start
from
man
in
his
present
state
and
hope
to
attain
their
end
by
an
analysis
of
him
unconsciously
they
look
upon
man
as
an
veritas
as
a
thing
unchangeable
in
all
commotion
as
a
sure
standard
of
things
but
everything
that
the
philosopher
says
about
man
is
really
nothing
more
than
testimony
about
the
man
of
a
space
of
time
a
lack
of
the
historical
sense
is
the
hereditary
fault
of
all
philosophers
many
indeed
unconsciously
mistake
the
very
latest
variety
of
man
such
as
has
arisen
under
the
influence
of
certain
religions
certain
political
events
for
the
permanent
form
from
which
one
must
set
out
they
will
not
learn
that
man
has
developed
that
his
faculty
of
knowledge
has
developed
also
whilst
for
some
of
them
the
entire
world
is
spun
out
of
this
faculty
of
knowledge
now
everything
in
human
development
happened
in
times
long
before
those
four
thousand
years
which
we
know
something
of
man
may
not
have
changed
much
during
this
time
but
the
philosopher
sees
instincts
in
the
present
man
and
takes
it
for
granted
that
this
is
one
of
the
unalterable
facts
of
mankind
and
consequently
can
furnish
a
key
to
the
understanding
of
the
world
the
entire
teleology
is
so
constructed
that
man
of
the
last
four
thousand
years
is
spoken
of
as
an
being
towards
which
all
things
in
the
world
have
from
the
beginning
a
natural
direction
but
everything
has
evolved
there
are
eternal
facts
as
there
are
likewise
no
absolute
truths
therefore
is
henceforth
necessary
and
with
it
the
virtue
of
diffidence
appreciation
of
unpretentious
it
is
a
mark
of
a
higher
culture
to
value
the
little
unpretentious
truths
which
have
been
found
by
means
of
strict
method
more
highly
than
the
and
dazzling
errors
which
spring
from
metaphysical
and
artistic
times
and
peoples
first
of
all
one
has
scorn
on
the
lips
for
the
former
as
if
here
nothing
could
have
equal
privileges
with
anything
else
so
unassuming
simple
bashful
apparently
discouraging
are
they
so
beautiful
stately
intoxicating
perhaps
even
animating
are
the
others
but
the
hardly
attained
the
certain
the
lasting
and
therefore
of
great
consequence
for
all
wider
knowledge
is
still
the
higher
to
keep
one
self
to
that
is
manly
and
shows
bravery
simplicity
and
forbearance
gradually
not
only
single
individuals
but
the
whole
of
mankind
will
be
raised
to
this
manliness
when
it
has
at
last
accustomed
itself
to
the
higher
appreciation
of
durable
lasting
knowledge
and
has
lost
all
belief
in
inspiration
and
the
miraculous
communication
of
truths
respecters
of
certainly
with
their
standard
of
the
beautiful
and
noble
will
first
of
all
have
good
reasons
for
mockery
as
soon
as
the
appreciation
of
unpretentious
truths
and
the
scientific
spirit
begin
to
obtain
the
mastery
but
only
because
their
eye
has
either
not
yet
recognised
the
charm
of
the
form
or
because
men
educated
in
that
spirit
are
not
yet
completely
and
inwardly
saturated
by
it
so
that
they
still
thoughtlessly
imitate
old
forms
and
badly
enough
as
one
does
who
no
longer
cares
much
about
the
matter
formerly
the
spirit
was
not
occupied
with
strict
thought
its
earnestness
then
lay
in
the
spinning
out
of
symbols
and
forms
this
is
changed
that
earnestness
in
the
symbolical
has
become
the
mark
of
a
lower
culture
as
our
arts
themselves
grow
evermore
intellectual
our
senses
more
spiritual
and
as
for
instance
people
now
judge
concerning
what
sounds
well
to
the
senses
quite
differently
from
how
they
did
a
hundred
years
ago
so
the
forms
of
our
life
grow
ever
more
to
the
eye
of
older
ages
perhaps
but
only
because
it
is
incapable
of
perceiving
how
the
kingdom
of
the
inward
spiritual
beauty
constantly
grows
deeper
and
wider
and
to
what
extent
the
inner
intellectual
look
may
be
of
more
importance
to
us
all
than
the
most
beautiful
bodily
frame
and
the
noblest
architectural
structure
astrology
and
the
it
is
probable
that
the
objects
of
religious
moral
æsthetic
and
logical
sentiment
likewise
belong
only
to
the
surface
of
things
while
man
willingly
believes
that
here
at
least
he
has
touched
the
heart
of
the
world
he
deceives
himself
because
those
things
enrapture
him
so
profoundly
and
make
him
so
profoundly
unhappy
and
he
therefore
shows
the
same
pride
here
as
in
astrology
for
astrology
believes
that
the
firmament
moves
round
the
destiny
of
man
the
moral
man
however
takes
it
for
granted
that
what
he
has
essentially
at
heart
must
also
be
the
essence
and
heart
of
things
misunderstanding
of
in
the
ages
of
a
rude
and
primitive
civilisation
man
believed
that
in
dreams
he
became
acquainted
with
a
actual
herein
lies
the
origin
of
all
metaphysics
without
dreams
there
could
have
been
found
no
reason
for
a
division
of
the
world
the
distinction
too
between
soul
and
body
is
connected
with
the
most
ancient
comprehension
of
dreams
also
the
supposition
of
an
imaginary
therefore
the
origin
of
all
belief
in
spirits
and
probably
also
the
belief
in
gods
the
dead
continues
to
live
he
appears
to
the
living
in
a
dream
thus
men
reasoned
of
old
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
the
scientific
spirit
partially
but
not
wholly
the
subdivisions
of
science
taken
separately
are
dealt
with
purely
in
relation
to
themselves
the
general
great
sciences
on
the
contrary
regarded
as
a
whole
call
up
the
question
certainly
a
very
one
wherefore
to
what
end
it
is
this
utilitarian
consideration
which
causes
them
to
be
dealt
with
less
impersonally
when
taken
as
a
whole
than
when
considered
in
their
various
parts
in
philosophy
above
all
as
the
apex
of
the
entire
pyramid
of
science
the
question
as
to
the
utility
of
knowledge
is
involuntarily
brought
forward
and
every
philosophy
has
the
unconscious
intention
of
ascribing
to
it
the
usefulness
for
this
reason
there
is
so
much
metaphysics
in
all
philosophies
and
such
a
shyness
of
the
apparently
unimportant
solutions
of
physics
for
the
importance
of
knowledge
for
life
appear
as
great
as
possible
here
is
the
antagonism
between
the
separate
provinces
of
science
and
philosophy
the
latter
desires
what
art
does
to
give
the
greatest
possible
depth
and
meaning
to
life
and
actions
in
the
former
one
seeks
knowledge
and
nothing
further
whatever
may
emerge
thereby
so
far
there
has
been
no
philosopher
in
whose
hands
philosophy
has
not
grown
into
an
apology
for
knowledge
on
this
point
at
least
every
one
is
an
optimist
that
the
greatest
usefulness
must
be
ascribed
to
knowledge
they
are
all
tyrannised
over
by
logic
and
this
is
optimism
in
its
essence
the
in
philosophy
separated
from
science
when
it
asked
the
question
which
is
the
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
life
which
enables
man
to
live
most
happily
this
happened
in
the
socratic
schools
the
veins
of
scientific
investigation
were
bound
up
by
the
point
of
view
of
and
are
so
still
pneumatic
explanation
of
metaphysics
explains
the
writing
of
nature
so
to
speak
as
the
church
and
her
learned
men
formerly
did
with
the
bible
a
great
deal
of
understanding
is
required
to
apply
to
nature
the
same
method
of
strict
interpretation
as
the
philologists
have
now
established
for
all
books
with
the
intention
of
clearly
understanding
what
the
text
means
but
not
suspecting
a
sense
or
even
taking
it
for
granted
just
however
as
with
regard
to
books
the
bad
art
of
interpretation
is
by
no
means
overcome
and
in
the
most
cultivated
society
one
still
constantly
comes
across
the
remains
of
allegorical
and
mystic
interpretation
so
it
is
also
with
regard
to
nature
indeed
it
is
even
much
worse
the
metaphysical
it
is
true
that
there
be
a
metaphysical
world
the
absolute
possibility
of
it
is
hardly
to
be
disputed
we
look
at
everything
through
the
human
head
and
can
not
cut
this
head
off
while
the
question
remains
what
would
be
left
of
the
world
if
it
had
been
cut
off
this
is
a
purely
scientific
problem
and
one
not
very
likely
to
trouble
mankind
but
everything
which
has
hitherto
made
metaphysical
suppositions
terrible
for
man
what
has
produced
them
is
passion
error
and
the
very
worst
methods
of
knowledge
not
the
best
have
taught
belief
therein
when
these
methods
have
been
discovered
as
the
foundation
of
all
existing
religions
and
metaphysics
they
have
been
refuted
then
there
still
always
remains
that
possibility
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
with
it
much
less
is
it
possible
to
let
happiness
salvation
and
life
depend
on
the
of
such
a
possibility
for
nothing
could
be
said
of
the
metaphysical
world
but
that
it
would
be
a
different
condition
a
condition
inaccessible
and
incomprehensible
to
us
it
would
be
a
thing
of
negative
qualities
were
the
existence
of
such
a
world
ever
so
well
proved
the
fact
would
nevertheless
remain
that
it
would
be
precisely
the
most
irrelevant
of
all
forms
of
knowledge
more
irrelevant
than
the
knowledge
of
the
chemical
analysis
of
water
to
the
sailor
in
danger
in
a
storm
the
harmlessness
of
metaphysics
in
the
directly
the
origins
of
religion
art
and
morals
have
been
so
described
that
one
can
perfectly
explain
them
without
having
recourse
to
metaphysical
concepts
at
the
beginning
and
in
the
course
of
the
path
the
strongest
interest
in
the
purely
theoretical
problem
of
the
and
the
phenomenon
ceases
for
however
it
may
be
here
with
religion
art
and
morals
we
do
not
touch
the
essence
of
the
world
in
itself
we
are
in
the
domain
of
representation
no
intuition
can
carry
us
further
with
the
greatest
calmness
we
shall
leave
the
question
as
to
how
our
own
conception
of
the
world
can
differ
so
widely
from
the
revealed
essence
of
the
world
to
physiology
and
the
history
of
the
evolution
of
organisms
and
ideas
language
as
a
presumptive
the
importance
of
language
for
the
development
of
culture
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
language
man
has
placed
a
world
of
his
own
beside
the
other
a
position
which
he
deemed
so
fixed
that
he
might
therefrom
lift
the
rest
of
the
world
off
its
hinges
and
make
himself
master
of
it
inasmuch
as
man
has
believed
in
the
ideas
and
names
of
things
as
for
a
great
length
of
time
he
has
acquired
that
pride
by
which
he
has
raised
himself
above
the
animal
he
really
thought
that
in
language
he
possessed
the
knowledge
of
the
world
the
maker
of
language
was
not
modest
enough
to
think
that
he
only
gave
designations
to
things
he
believed
rather
that
with
his
words
he
expressed
the
widest
knowledge
of
the
things
in
reality
language
is
the
first
step
in
the
endeavour
after
science
here
also
it
is
belief
in
ascertained
truth
from
which
the
mightiest
sources
of
strength
have
flowed
much
later
only
now
it
is
dawning
upon
men
that
they
have
propagated
a
tremendous
error
in
their
belief
in
language
fortunately
it
is
now
too
late
to
reverse
the
development
of
reason
which
is
founded
upon
that
belief
also
is
founded
upon
suppositions
to
which
nothing
in
the
actual
world
corresponds
for
instance
on
the
supposition
of
the
equality
of
things
and
the
identity
of
the
same
thing
at
different
points
of
time
but
that
particular
science
arose
out
of
the
contrary
belief
that
such
things
really
existed
in
the
actual
world
it
is
the
same
with
mathematics
which
would
certainly
not
have
arisen
if
it
had
been
known
from
the
beginning
that
in
nature
there
are
no
exactly
straight
lines
no
real
circle
no
absolute
standard
of
size
dream
and
the
function
of
the
brain
which
is
most
influenced
by
sleep
is
the
memory
not
that
it
entirely
ceases
but
it
is
brought
back
to
a
condition
of
imperfection
such
as
everyone
may
have
experienced
in
times
whether
asleep
or
awake
arbitrary
and
confused
as
it
is
it
constantly
confounds
things
on
the
ground
of
the
most
fleeting
resemblances
but
with
the
same
arbitrariness
and
confusion
the
ancients
invented
their
mythologies
and
even
at
the
present
day
travellers
are
accustomed
to
remark
how
prone
the
savage
is
to
forgetfulness
how
after
a
short
tension
of
memory
his
mind
begins
to
sway
here
and
there
from
sheer
weariness
and
gives
forth
lies
and
nonsense
but
in
dreams
we
all
resemble
the
savage
bad
recognition
and
erroneous
comparisons
are
the
reasons
of
the
bad
conclusions
of
which
we
are
guilty
in
dreams
so
that
when
we
clearly
recollect
what
we
have
dreamt
we
are
alarmed
at
ourselves
at
harbouring
so
much
foolishness
within
us
the
perfect
distinctness
of
all
which
absolute
faith
in
their
reality
recall
the
conditions
that
appertain
to
primitive
man
in
whom
hallucination
was
extraordinarily
frequent
and
sometimes
simultaneously
seized
entire
communities
entire
nations
therefore
in
sleep
and
in
dreams
we
once
more
carry
out
the
task
of
early
humanity
the
logic
of
in
sleep
our
nervous
system
is
perpetually
excited
by
numerous
inner
occurrences
nearly
all
the
organs
are
disjointed
and
in
a
state
of
activity
the
blood
runs
its
turbulent
course
the
position
of
the
sleeper
causes
pressure
on
certain
limbs
his
coverings
influence
his
sensations
in
various
ways
the
stomach
digests
and
by
its
movements
it
disturbs
other
organs
the
intestines
writhe
the
position
of
the
head
occasions
unaccustomed
play
of
muscles
the
feet
unshod
not
pressing
upon
the
floor
with
the
soles
occasion
the
feeling
of
the
unaccustomed
just
as
does
the
different
clothing
of
the
whole
body
all
this
according
to
its
daily
change
and
extent
excites
by
its
extraordinariness
the
entire
system
to
the
very
functions
of
the
brain
and
thus
there
are
a
hundred
occasions
for
the
spirit
to
be
surprised
and
to
seek
for
the
of
this
excitation
the
dream
however
is
seeking
and
representing
of
the
of
those
excited
sensations
that
is
of
the
supposed
causes
a
person
who
for
instance
binds
his
feet
with
two
straps
will
perhaps
dream
that
two
serpents
are
coiling
round
his
feet
this
is
first
hypothesis
then
a
belief
with
an
accompanying
picture
and
interpretation
these
serpents
must
be
the
of
those
sensations
which
i
the
sleeper
experience
so
decides
the
mind
of
the
sleeper
the
immediate
past
so
disclosed
becomes
to
him
the
present
through
his
excited
imagination
thus
every
one
knows
from
experience
how
quickly
the
dreamer
weaves
into
his
dream
a
loud
sound
that
he
hears
such
as
the
ringing
of
bells
or
the
firing
of
cannon
that
is
to
say
explains
it
from
so
that
he
first
he
experiences
the
producing
circumstances
and
then
that
sound
but
how
does
it
happen
that
the
mind
of
the
dreamer
is
always
so
mistaken
while
the
same
mind
when
awake
is
accustomed
to
be
so
temperate
careful
and
sceptical
with
regard
to
its
hypotheses
so
that
the
first
random
hypothesis
for
the
explanation
of
a
feeling
suffices
for
him
to
believe
immediately
in
its
truth
for
in
dreaming
we
believe
in
the
dream
as
if
it
were
a
reality
we
think
our
hypothesis
completely
proved
i
hold
that
as
man
now
still
reasons
in
dreams
so
men
reasoned
also
through
thousands
of
years
the
first
which
occurred
to
the
mind
to
explain
anything
that
required
an
explanation
was
sufficient
and
stood
for
truth
thus
according
to
travellers
tales
savages
still
do
to
this
very
day
this
ancient
element
in
human
nature
still
manifests
itself
in
our
dreams
for
it
is
the
foundation
upon
which
the
higher
reason
has
developed
and
still
develops
in
every
individual
the
dream
carries
us
back
into
remote
conditions
of
human
culture
and
provides
a
ready
means
of
understanding
them
better
is
now
so
easy
to
us
because
during
immense
periods
of
human
development
we
have
been
so
well
drilled
in
this
form
of
fantastic
and
cheap
explanation
by
means
of
the
first
agreeable
notions
in
so
far
dreaming
is
a
recreation
for
the
brain
which
by
day
has
to
satisfy
the
stern
demands
of
thought
as
they
are
laid
down
by
the
higher
culture
we
can
at
once
discern
an
allied
process
even
in
our
awakened
state
as
the
door
and
of
the
dream
if
we
shut
our
eyes
the
brain
produces
a
number
of
impressions
of
light
and
colour
probably
as
a
kind
of
and
echo
of
all
those
effects
of
light
which
crowd
in
upon
it
by
day
now
however
the
understanding
together
with
the
imagination
instantly
works
up
this
play
of
colour
shapeless
in
itself
into
definite
figures
forms
landscapes
and
animated
groups
the
actual
accompanying
process
thereby
is
again
a
kind
of
conclusion
from
the
effect
to
the
cause
since
the
mind
asks
whence
come
these
impressions
of
light
and
colour
it
supposes
those
figures
and
forms
as
causes
it
takes
them
for
the
origin
of
those
colours
and
lights
because
in
the
daytime
with
open
eyes
it
is
accustomed
to
find
a
producing
cause
for
every
colour
every
effect
of
light
here
therefore
the
imagination
constantly
places
pictures
before
the
mind
since
it
supports
itself
on
the
visual
impressions
of
the
day
in
their
production
and
the
does
just
the
same
thing
that
is
the
supposed
cause
is
deduced
from
the
effect
and
represented
after
the
effect
all
this
happens
with
extraordinary
rapidity
so
that
here
as
with
the
conjuror
a
confusion
of
judgment
may
arise
and
a
sequence
may
look
like
something
simultaneous
or
even
like
a
reversed
sequence
from
these
circumstances
we
may
gather
the
more
acute
logical
thinking
the
strict
discrimination
of
cause
and
effect
has
been
developed
when
our
reasoning
and
understanding
faculties
involuntarily
hark
back
to
those
primitive
forms
of
deduction
and
when
we
pass
about
half
our
life
in
this
condition
the
poet
too
and
the
artist
assign
causes
for
their
moods
and
conditions
which
are
by
no
means
the
true
ones
in
this
they
recall
an
older
humanity
and
can
assist
us
to
the
understanding
of
it
all
moods
bring
with
them
a
of
kindred
sensations
and
moods
they
grub
up
the
memory
so
to
speak
along
with
them
something
within
us
remembers
and
becomes
conscious
of
similar
conditions
and
their
origin
thus
there
are
formed
quick
habitual
connections
of
feelings
and
thoughts
which
eventually
when
they
follow
each
other
with
lightning
speed
are
no
longer
felt
as
complexes
but
as
in
this
sense
one
speaks
of
the
moral
feeling
of
the
religious
feeling
as
if
they
were
absolute
unities
in
reality
they
are
streams
with
a
hundred
sources
and
tributaries
here
also
as
so
often
happens
the
unity
of
the
word
is
no
security
for
the
unity
of
the
thing
no
internal
and
external
in
the
as
democritus
transferred
the
concepts
above
and
below
to
endless
space
where
they
have
no
sense
so
philosophers
in
general
have
transferred
the
concepts
internal
and
external
to
the
essence
and
appearance
of
the
world
they
think
that
with
deep
feelings
one
can
penetrate
deeply
into
the
internal
and
approach
the
heart
of
nature
but
these
feelings
are
only
deep
in
so
far
as
along
with
them
barely
noticeable
certain
complicated
groups
of
thoughts
which
we
call
deep
are
regularly
excited
a
feeling
is
deep
because
we
think
that
the
accompanying
thought
is
deep
but
the
deep
thought
can
nevertheless
be
very
far
from
the
truth
as
for
instance
every
metaphysical
one
if
one
take
away
from
the
deep
feeling
the
commingled
elements
of
thought
then
the
feeling
remains
and
this
guarantees
nothing
for
knowledge
but
itself
just
as
strong
faith
proves
only
its
strength
and
not
the
truth
of
what
is
believed
in
phenomenon
and
philosophers
are
in
the
habit
of
setting
themselves
before
life
and
experience
before
that
which
they
call
the
world
of
appearance
as
before
a
picture
that
is
once
for
all
unrolled
and
exhibits
unchangeably
fixed
the
same
process
this
process
they
think
must
be
rightly
interpreted
in
order
to
come
to
a
conclusion
about
the
being
that
produced
the
picture
about
the
therefore
which
is
always
accustomed
to
be
regarded
as
sufficient
ground
for
the
world
of
phenomenon
on
the
other
hand
since
one
always
makes
the
idea
of
the
metaphysical
stand
definitely
as
that
of
the
unconditioned
also
unconditioning
one
must
directly
disown
all
connection
between
the
unconditioned
the
metaphysical
world
and
the
world
which
is
known
to
us
so
that
the
should
most
certainly
appear
in
the
phenomenon
and
every
conclusion
from
the
former
as
regards
the
latter
is
to
be
rejected
both
sides
overlook
the
fact
that
that
picture
that
which
we
now
call
human
life
and
experience
has
gradually
evolved
nay
is
still
in
the
full
process
of
evolving
and
therefore
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
fixed
magnitude
from
which
a
conclusion
about
its
originator
might
be
deduced
the
sufficing
cause
or
even
merely
neglected
it
is
because
for
thousands
of
years
we
have
looked
into
the
world
with
moral
æsthetic
and
religious
pretensions
with
blind
inclination
passion
or
fear
and
have
surfeited
ourselves
in
the
vices
of
illogical
thought
that
this
world
has
gradually
so
marvellously
motley
terrible
full
of
meaning
and
of
soul
it
has
acquired
colour
but
we
were
the
colourists
the
human
intellect
on
the
basis
of
human
needs
of
human
emotions
has
caused
this
phenomenon
to
appear
and
has
carried
its
erroneous
fundamental
conceptions
into
things
late
very
late
it
takes
to
thinking
and
now
the
world
of
experience
and
the
seem
to
it
so
extraordinarily
different
and
separated
that
it
gives
up
drawing
conclusions
from
the
former
to
the
latter
or
in
a
terribly
mysterious
manner
demands
the
renunciation
of
our
intellect
of
our
personal
will
in
order
to
reach
the
essential
that
one
may
again
others
have
collected
all
the
characteristic
features
of
our
world
of
phenomenon
that
is
the
idea
of
the
world
spun
out
of
intellectual
errors
and
inherited
by
us
and
of
accusing
the
as
the
offenders
they
have
laid
the
blame
on
the
nature
of
things
as
being
the
cause
of
the
hard
fact
of
this
very
sinister
character
of
the
world
and
have
preached
the
deliverance
from
being
with
all
these
conceptions
the
constant
and
laborious
process
of
science
which
at
last
celebrates
its
greatest
triumph
in
a
of
the
origin
of
becomes
completed
in
various
ways
the
result
of
which
might
perhaps
run
as
follows
that
which
we
now
call
the
world
is
the
result
of
a
mass
of
errors
and
fantasies
which
arose
gradually
in
the
general
development
of
organic
being
which
are
with
each
other
and
are
now
inherited
by
us
as
the
accumulated
treasure
of
all
the
past
as
a
treasure
for
the
value
of
our
humanity
depends
upon
it
from
this
world
of
representation
strict
science
is
really
only
able
to
liberate
us
to
a
very
slight
extent
as
it
is
also
not
at
all
desirable
inasmuch
as
it
can
not
essentially
break
the
power
of
primitive
habits
of
feeling
but
it
can
gradually
elucidate
the
history
of
the
rise
of
that
world
as
representation
and
lift
us
at
least
for
moments
above
and
beyond
the
whole
process
perhaps
we
shall
then
recognise
that
the
thing
in
itself
is
worth
a
homeric
laugh
that
it
so
much
indeed
everything
and
really
empty
namely
empty
of
meaning
metaphysical
the
young
man
values
metaphysical
explanations
because
they
show
him
something
highly
significant
in
things
which
he
found
unpleasant
or
despicable
and
if
he
is
dissatisfied
with
himself
the
feeling
becomes
lighter
when
he
recognises
the
innermost
or
in
that
which
he
so
strongly
disapproves
of
in
himself
to
feel
himself
less
responsible
and
at
the
same
time
to
find
things
more
interesting
that
seems
to
him
a
double
benefit
for
which
he
has
to
thank
metaphysics
later
on
certainly
he
gets
distrustful
of
the
whole
metaphysical
method
of
explanation
then
perhaps
it
grows
clear
to
him
that
those
results
can
be
obtained
equally
well
and
more
scientifically
in
another
way
that
physical
and
historical
explanations
produce
the
feeling
of
personal
relief
to
at
least
the
same
extent
and
that
the
interest
in
life
and
its
problems
is
perhaps
still
more
aroused
thereby
fundamental
questions
of
when
the
history
of
the
rise
of
thought
comes
to
be
written
a
new
light
will
be
thrown
on
the
following
statement
of
a
distinguished
logician
the
primordial
general
law
of
the
cognisant
subject
consists
in
the
inner
necessity
of
recognising
every
object
in
itself
in
its
own
nature
as
a
thing
identical
with
itself
consequently
and
at
bottom
remaining
ever
the
same
and
unchangeable
in
short
in
recognising
everything
as
a
substance
even
this
law
which
is
here
called
primordial
has
evolved
it
will
some
day
be
shown
how
gradually
this
tendency
arises
in
the
lower
organisms
how
the
feeble
of
their
organisations
at
first
see
only
the
same
thing
how
then
when
the
various
awakenings
of
pleasure
and
displeasure
become
noticeable
various
substances
are
gradually
distinguished
but
each
with
one
attribute
one
single
relation
to
such
an
organism
the
first
step
in
logic
is
the
judgment
the
nature
of
which
according
to
the
decision
of
the
best
logicians
consists
in
belief
at
the
bottom
of
all
belief
lies
sensation
of
the
pleasant
or
the
in
relation
to
the
a
new
third
sensation
as
the
result
of
two
previous
single
sensations
is
the
judgment
in
its
simplest
form
we
organic
beings
have
originally
no
interest
in
anything
but
its
relation
to
in
connection
with
pleasure
and
pain
between
the
moments
the
states
of
feeling
when
we
become
conscious
of
this
connection
lie
moments
of
rest
of
the
world
and
everything
is
then
without
interest
for
us
we
notice
no
change
in
it
as
even
now
a
deeply
interested
person
does
not
notice
when
any
one
passes
him
to
the
plant
things
are
as
a
rule
tranquil
and
eternal
everything
like
itself
from
the
period
of
the
lower
organisms
man
has
inherited
the
belief
that
exist
this
theory
is
only
contradicted
by
the
matured
experience
of
the
most
advanced
science
the
primordial
belief
of
everything
organic
from
the
beginning
is
perhaps
even
this
that
all
the
rest
of
the
world
is
one
and
immovable
the
point
furthest
removed
from
those
early
beginnings
of
logic
is
the
idea
of
indeed
we
still
really
think
that
all
sensations
and
activities
are
acts
of
the
free
will
when
the
sentient
individual
contemplates
himself
he
regards
every
sensation
every
alteration
as
something
that
is
to
say
unconditioned
and
disconnected
it
rises
up
in
us
without
connection
with
anything
foregoing
or
following
we
are
hungry
but
do
not
originally
think
that
the
organism
must
be
nourished
the
feeling
seems
to
make
itself
felt
cause
and
purpose
it
isolates
itself
and
regards
itself
as
arbitrary
therefore
belief
in
the
freedom
of
the
will
is
an
original
error
of
everything
organic
as
old
as
the
existence
of
the
awakenings
of
logic
in
it
the
belief
in
unconditioned
substances
and
similar
things
is
equally
a
primordial
as
well
as
an
old
error
of
everything
organic
but
inasmuch
as
all
metaphysics
has
concerned
itself
chiefly
with
substance
and
the
freedom
of
will
it
may
be
designated
as
the
science
which
treats
of
the
fundamental
errors
of
mankind
but
treats
of
them
as
if
they
were
fundamental
truths
the
discovery
of
the
laws
of
numbers
is
made
upon
the
ground
of
the
original
already
prevailing
error
that
there
are
many
similar
things
but
in
reality
there
is
nothing
similar
at
least
that
there
are
things
but
there
is
no
thing
the
supposition
of
plurality
always
presumes
that
there
is
something
which
appears
frequently
but
here
already
error
reigns
already
we
imagine
beings
unities
which
do
not
exist
our
sensations
of
space
and
time
are
false
for
they
lead
examined
in
sequence
to
logical
contradictions
in
all
scientific
determinations
we
always
reckon
inevitably
with
certain
false
quantities
but
as
these
quantities
are
at
least
constant
as
for
instance
our
sensation
of
time
and
space
the
conclusions
of
science
have
still
perfect
accuracy
and
certainty
in
their
connection
with
one
another
one
may
continue
to
build
upon
them
until
that
final
limit
where
the
erroneous
original
suppositions
those
constant
faults
come
into
conflict
with
the
conclusions
for
instance
in
the
doctrine
of
atoms
there
still
we
always
feel
ourselves
compelled
to
the
acceptance
of
a
thing
or
material
that
is
moved
whilst
the
whole
scientific
procedure
has
pursued
the
very
task
of
resolving
everything
substantial
material
into
motion
here
too
we
still
separate
with
our
sensation
the
mover
and
the
moved
and
can
not
get
out
of
this
circle
because
the
belief
in
things
has
from
immemorial
times
been
bound
up
with
our
being
when
kant
says
the
understanding
does
not
derive
its
laws
from
nature
but
dictates
them
to
her
it
is
perfectly
true
with
regard
to
the
idea
of
nature
which
we
are
compelled
to
associate
with
her
nature
world
as
representation
that
is
to
say
as
error
but
which
is
the
summing
up
of
a
number
of
errors
of
the
understanding
the
laws
of
numbers
are
entirely
inapplicable
to
a
world
which
is
not
our
representation
these
laws
obtain
only
in
the
human
world
a
few
steps
a
degree
of
culture
and
assuredly
a
very
high
one
is
attained
when
man
rises
above
superstitious
and
religious
notions
and
fears
and
for
instance
no
longer
believes
in
guardian
angels
or
in
original
sin
and
has
also
ceased
to
talk
of
the
salvation
of
his
soul
if
he
has
attained
to
this
degree
of
freedom
he
has
still
also
to
overcome
metaphysics
with
the
greatest
exertion
of
his
intelligence
then
however
a
is
necessary
he
must
understand
the
historical
justification
as
well
as
the
psychological
in
such
representations
he
must
recognise
how
the
greatest
advancement
of
humanity
has
come
therefrom
and
how
without
such
a
retrocursive
movement
we
should
have
been
robbed
of
the
best
products
of
hitherto
existing
mankind
with
regard
to
philosophical
metaphysics
i
always
see
increasing
numbers
who
have
attained
to
the
negative
goal
that
all
positive
metaphysics
is
error
but
as
yet
few
who
climb
a
few
rungs
backwards
one
ought
to
look
out
perhaps
over
the
last
steps
of
the
ladder
but
not
try
to
stand
upon
them
the
most
enlightened
only
succeed
so
far
as
to
free
themselves
from
metaphysics
and
look
back
upon
it
with
superiority
while
it
is
necessary
here
too
as
in
the
hippodrome
to
turn
round
the
end
of
the
course
conjectural
victory
of
for
once
let
the
sceptical
be
accepted
granted
that
there
were
no
other
metaphysical
world
and
all
explanations
drawn
from
metaphysics
about
the
only
world
we
know
were
useless
to
us
in
what
light
should
we
then
look
upon
men
and
things
we
can
think
this
out
for
ourselves
it
is
useful
even
though
the
question
whether
anything
metaphysical
has
been
scientifically
proved
by
kant
and
schopenhauer
were
altogether
set
aside
for
it
is
quite
possible
according
to
historical
probability
that
some
time
or
other
man
as
a
general
rule
may
grow
the
question
will
then
be
this
what
form
will
human
society
take
under
the
influence
of
such
a
mode
of
thought
perhaps
the
of
some
metaphysical
world
or
other
is
already
so
that
mankind
will
never
get
rid
of
a
certain
distrust
of
it
and
when
there
is
distrust
of
metaphysics
there
are
on
the
whole
the
same
results
as
if
it
had
been
directly
refuted
and
no
longer
be
believed
in
the
historical
question
with
regard
to
an
unmetaphysical
frame
of
mind
in
mankind
remains
the
same
in
both
cases
unbelief
in
the
ære
an
actual
drawback
which
accompanies
the
cessation
of
metaphysical
views
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
individual
looks
upon
his
short
span
of
life
too
exclusively
and
receives
no
stronger
incentives
to
build
durable
institutions
intended
to
last
for
centuries
he
himself
wishes
to
pluck
the
fruit
from
the
tree
which
he
plants
and
therefore
he
no
longer
plants
those
trees
which
require
regular
care
for
centuries
and
which
are
destined
to
afford
shade
to
a
long
series
of
generations
for
metaphysical
views
furnish
the
belief
that
in
them
the
last
conclusive
foundation
has
been
given
upon
which
henceforth
all
the
future
of
mankind
is
compelled
to
settle
down
and
establish
itself
the
individual
furthers
his
salvation
when
for
instance
he
founds
a
church
or
convent
he
thinks
it
will
be
reckoned
to
him
and
recompensed
to
him
in
the
eternal
life
of
the
soul
it
is
work
for
the
soul
eternal
salvation
can
science
also
arouse
such
faith
in
its
results
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
needs
doubt
and
distrust
as
its
most
faithful
auxiliaries
nevertheless
in
the
course
of
time
the
sum
of
inviolable
truths
those
namely
which
have
weathered
all
the
storms
of
scepticism
and
all
destructive
analysis
may
have
become
so
great
in
the
regimen
of
health
for
instance
that
one
may
determine
to
found
thereupon
eternal
works
for
the
present
the
between
our
excited
ephemeral
existence
and
the
repose
of
metaphysical
ages
still
operates
too
strongly
because
the
two
ages
still
stand
too
closely
together
the
individual
man
himself
now
goes
through
too
many
inward
and
outward
developments
for
him
to
venture
to
arrange
his
own
lifetime
permanently
and
once
and
for
all
an
entirely
modern
man
for
instance
who
is
going
to
build
himself
a
house
has
a
feeling
as
if
he
were
going
to
immure
himself
alive
in
a
mausoleum
the
age
of
the
less
men
are
fettered
by
tradition
the
greater
becomes
the
inward
activity
of
their
motives
the
greater
again
in
proportion
thereto
the
outward
restlessness
the
confused
flux
of
mankind
the
polyphony
of
strivings
for
whom
is
there
still
an
absolute
compulsion
to
bind
himself
and
his
descendants
to
one
place
for
whom
is
there
still
anything
strictly
compulsory
as
all
styles
of
arts
are
imitated
simultaneously
so
also
are
all
grades
and
kinds
of
morality
of
customs
of
cultures
such
an
age
obtains
its
importance
because
in
it
the
various
views
of
the
world
customs
and
cultures
can
be
compared
and
experienced
simultaneously
which
was
formerly
not
possible
with
the
always
localised
sway
of
every
culture
corresponding
to
the
rooting
of
all
artistic
styles
in
place
and
time
an
increased
æsthetic
feeling
will
now
at
last
decide
amongst
so
many
forms
presenting
themselves
for
comparison
it
will
allow
the
greater
number
that
is
to
say
all
those
rejected
by
it
to
die
out
in
the
same
way
a
selection
amongst
the
forms
and
customs
of
the
higher
moralities
is
taking
place
of
which
the
aim
can
be
nothing
else
than
the
downfall
of
the
lower
moralities
it
is
the
age
of
comparison
that
is
its
pride
but
more
justly
also
its
grief
let
us
not
be
afraid
of
this
grief
rather
will
we
comprehend
as
adequately
as
possible
the
task
our
age
sets
us
posterity
will
bless
us
for
doing
so
a
posterity
which
knows
itself
to
be
as
much
above
the
terminated
original
national
cultures
as
above
the
culture
of
comparison
but
which
looks
back
with
gratitude
on
both
kinds
of
culture
as
upon
antiquities
worthy
of
veneration
the
possibility
of
when
a
scholar
of
the
ancient
culture
forswears
the
company
of
men
who
believe
in
progress
he
does
quite
right
for
the
greatness
and
goodness
of
ancient
culture
lie
behind
it
and
historical
education
compels
one
to
admit
that
they
can
never
be
fresh
again
an
unbearable
stupidity
or
an
equally
insufferable
fanaticism
would
be
necessary
to
deny
this
but
men
can
resolve
to
develop
themselves
towards
a
new
culture
whilst
formerly
they
only
developed
unconsciously
and
by
chance
they
can
now
create
better
conditions
for
the
rise
of
human
beings
for
their
nourishment
education
and
instruction
they
can
administer
the
earth
economically
as
a
whole
and
can
generally
weigh
and
restrain
the
powers
of
man
this
new
conscious
culture
kills
the
old
which
regarded
as
a
whole
has
led
an
unconscious
animal
and
plant
life
it
also
kills
distrust
in
progress
progress
is
i
must
say
that
it
is
and
almost
nonsensical
to
believe
that
progress
must
follow
but
how
could
one
deny
that
it
is
possible
on
the
other
hand
progress
in
the
sense
and
on
the
path
of
the
old
culture
is
not
even
thinkable
even
if
romantic
fantasy
has
also
constantly
used
the
word
progress
to
denote
its
aims
for
instance
circumscribed
primitive
national
cultures
it
borrows
the
picture
of
it
in
any
case
from
the
past
its
thoughts
and
ideas
on
this
subject
are
entirely
without
originality
private
and
œcumenical
since
the
belief
has
ceased
that
a
god
directs
in
general
the
fate
of
the
world
and
in
spite
of
all
apparent
crookedness
in
the
path
of
humanity
leads
it
on
gloriously
men
themselves
must
set
themselves
œcumenical
aims
embracing
the
whole
earth
the
older
morality
especially
that
of
kant
required
from
the
individual
actions
which
were
desired
from
all
men
that
was
a
delightfully
naïve
thing
as
if
each
one
knew
what
course
of
action
was
beneficial
to
the
whole
of
humanity
and
consequently
which
actions
in
general
were
desirable
it
is
a
theory
like
that
of
free
trade
taking
for
granted
that
the
general
harmony
result
of
itself
according
to
innate
laws
of
amelioration
perhaps
a
future
contemplation
of
the
needs
of
humanity
will
show
that
it
is
by
no
means
desirable
that
all
men
should
act
alike
in
the
interest
of
œcumenical
aims
it
might
rather
be
that
for
whole
sections
of
mankind
special
and
perhaps
under
certain
circumstances
even
evil
tasks
would
have
to
be
set
in
any
case
if
mankind
is
not
to
destroy
itself
by
such
a
conscious
universal
rule
there
must
previously
be
found
as
a
scientific
standard
for
œcumenical
aims
a
of
the
conditions
of
superior
to
what
has
hitherto
been
attained
herein
lies
the
enormous
task
of
the
great
minds
of
the
next
century
reaction
as
now
and
again
there
appear
rugged
powerful
impetuous
but
nevertheless
minds
which
conjure
up
once
more
a
past
phase
of
mankind
they
serve
to
prove
that
the
new
tendencies
against
which
they
are
working
are
not
yet
sufficiently
strong
that
they
still
lack
something
otherwise
they
would
show
better
opposition
to
those
exorcisers
thus
for
example
reformation
bears
witness
to
the
fact
that
in
his
century
all
the
movements
of
the
freedom
of
the
spirit
were
still
uncertain
tender
and
youthful
science
could
not
yet
lift
up
its
head
indeed
the
whole
renaissance
seems
like
an
early
spring
which
is
almost
snowed
under
again
but
in
this
century
also
schopenhauer
metaphysics
showed
that
even
now
the
scientific
spirit
is
not
yet
strong
enough
thus
the
whole
mediæval
christian
view
of
the
world
and
human
feeling
could
celebrate
its
resurrection
in
schopenhauer
doctrine
in
spite
of
the
long
achieved
destruction
of
all
christian
dogmas
there
is
much
science
in
his
doctrine
but
it
does
not
dominate
it
it
is
rather
the
old
metaphysical
requirement
that
does
so
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
greatest
and
quite
invaluable
advantages
which
we
gain
from
schopenhauer
that
he
occasionally
forces
our
sensations
back
into
older
mightier
modes
of
contemplating
the
world
and
man
to
which
no
other
path
would
so
easily
lead
us
the
gain
to
history
and
justice
is
very
great
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
would
so
easily
succeed
now
in
doing
justice
to
christianity
and
its
asiatic
relations
without
schopenhauer
assistance
which
is
specially
impossible
from
the
basis
of
still
existing
christianity
only
after
this
great
of
justice
only
after
we
have
corrected
so
essential
a
point
as
the
historical
mode
of
contemplation
which
the
age
of
enlightenment
brought
with
it
may
we
again
bear
onward
the
banner
of
enlightenment
the
banner
with
the
three
names
petrarch
erasmus
voltaire
we
have
turned
reaction
into
progress
a
substitute
for
it
is
believed
that
something
good
is
said
of
philosophy
when
it
is
put
forward
as
a
substitute
for
religion
for
the
people
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
spiritual
economy
there
is
need
at
times
of
an
order
of
thought
the
transition
from
religion
to
scientific
contemplation
is
a
violent
dangerous
leap
which
is
not
to
be
recommended
to
this
extent
the
recommendation
is
justifiable
but
one
should
eventually
learn
that
the
needs
which
have
been
satisfied
by
religion
and
are
now
to
be
satisfied
by
philosophy
are
not
unchangeable
these
themselves
can
be
and
think
for
instance
of
the
distress
of
soul
his
sighing
over
inward
corruption
his
anxiety
for
salvation
all
notions
which
originate
only
in
errors
of
reason
and
deserve
not
satisfaction
but
destruction
a
philosophy
can
serve
either
to
those
needs
or
to
them
for
they
are
acquired
temporally
limited
needs
which
are
based
upon
suppositions
contradictory
to
those
of
science
here
in
order
to
make
a
transition
is
far
rather
to
be
employed
to
relieve
the
mind
overburdened
with
emotions
for
those
notions
receive
much
less
support
from
it
than
from
a
metaphysical
philosophy
it
is
easier
then
to
pass
over
from
art
to
a
really
liberating
philosophical
science
away
with
those
wearisomely
hackneyed
terms
optimism
and
pessimism
for
the
occasion
for
using
them
becomes
less
and
less
from
day
to
day
only
the
chatterboxes
still
find
them
so
absolutely
necessary
for
why
in
all
the
world
should
any
one
wish
to
be
an
optimist
unless
he
had
a
god
to
defend
who
have
created
the
best
of
worlds
if
he
himself
be
goodness
and
perfection
what
thinker
however
still
needs
the
hypothesis
of
a
god
but
every
occasion
for
a
pessimistic
confession
of
faith
is
also
lacking
when
one
has
no
interest
in
being
annoyed
at
the
advocates
of
god
the
theologians
or
the
theologising
philosophers
and
in
energetically
defending
the
opposite
view
that
evil
reigns
that
pain
is
greater
than
pleasure
that
the
world
is
a
bungled
piece
of
work
the
manifestation
of
an
to
life
but
who
still
bothers
about
the
theologians
now
except
the
theologians
apart
from
all
theology
and
its
contentions
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
world
is
not
good
and
not
bad
to
say
nothing
of
its
being
the
best
or
the
worst
and
that
the
terms
good
and
bad
have
only
significance
with
respect
to
man
and
indeed
perhaps
they
are
not
justified
even
here
in
the
way
they
are
usually
employed
in
any
case
we
must
get
rid
of
both
the
calumniating
and
the
glorifying
conception
of
the
world
intoxicated
by
the
scent
of
the
it
is
supposed
that
the
ship
of
humanity
has
always
a
deeper
draught
the
heavier
it
is
laden
it
is
believed
that
the
deeper
a
man
thinks
the
more
delicately
he
feels
the
higher
he
values
himself
the
greater
his
distance
from
the
other
animals
the
more
he
appears
as
a
genius
amongst
the
animals
all
the
nearer
will
he
approach
the
real
essence
of
the
world
and
its
knowledge
this
he
actually
does
too
through
science
but
he
to
do
so
still
more
through
his
religions
and
arts
these
certainly
are
blossoms
of
the
world
but
by
no
means
any
to
the
root
of
the
than
the
stalk
it
is
not
possible
to
understand
the
nature
of
things
better
through
them
although
almost
every
one
believes
he
can
has
made
man
so
deep
sensitive
and
inventive
that
he
has
put
forth
such
blossoms
as
religions
and
arts
pure
knowledge
could
not
have
been
capable
of
it
whoever
were
to
unveil
for
us
the
essence
of
the
world
would
give
us
all
the
most
disagreeable
disillusionment
not
the
world
as
but
the
world
as
representation
as
error
is
so
full
of
meaning
so
deep
so
wonderful
bearing
happiness
and
unhappiness
in
its
bosom
this
result
leads
to
a
philosophy
of
the
logical
denial
of
the
world
which
however
can
be
combined
with
a
practical
just
as
well
as
with
its
opposite
bad
habits
in
the
usual
false
conclusions
of
mankind
are
these
a
thing
exists
therefore
it
has
a
right
to
exist
here
there
is
inference
from
the
ability
to
live
to
its
suitability
from
its
suitability
to
its
rightfulness
then
an
opinion
brings
happiness
therefore
it
is
the
true
opinion
its
effect
is
good
therefore
it
is
itself
good
and
true
to
the
effect
is
here
assigned
the
predicate
beneficent
good
in
the
sense
of
the
useful
and
the
cause
is
then
furnished
with
the
same
predicate
good
but
here
in
the
sense
of
the
logically
valid
the
inversion
of
the
sentences
would
read
thus
an
affair
can
not
be
carried
through
or
maintained
therefore
it
is
wrong
an
opinion
causes
pain
or
excites
therefore
it
is
false
the
free
spirit
who
learns
only
too
often
the
faultiness
of
this
mode
of
reasoning
and
has
to
suffer
from
its
consequences
frequently
gives
way
to
the
temptation
to
draw
the
very
opposite
conclusions
which
in
general
are
naturally
just
as
false
an
affair
can
not
be
carried
through
therefore
it
is
good
an
opinion
is
distressing
and
disturbing
therefore
it
is
true
the
illogical
one
of
those
things
that
may
drive
a
thinker
into
despair
is
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
illogical
is
necessary
for
man
and
that
out
of
the
illogical
comes
much
that
is
good
it
is
so
firmly
rooted
in
the
passions
in
language
in
art
in
religion
and
generally
in
everything
that
gives
value
to
life
that
it
can
not
be
withdrawn
without
thereby
hopelessly
injuring
these
beautiful
things
it
is
only
the
people
who
can
believe
that
the
nature
of
man
can
be
changed
into
a
purely
logical
one
but
if
there
were
degrees
of
proximity
to
this
goal
how
many
things
would
not
have
to
be
lost
on
this
course
even
the
most
rational
man
has
need
of
nature
again
from
time
to
time
his
fundamental
towards
all
things
injustice
all
judgments
on
the
value
of
life
are
illogically
developed
and
therefore
unjust
the
inexactitude
of
the
judgment
lies
firstly
in
the
manner
in
which
the
material
is
presented
namely
very
imperfectly
secondly
in
the
manner
in
which
the
conclusion
is
formed
out
of
it
and
thirdly
in
the
fact
that
every
separate
element
of
the
material
is
again
the
result
of
vitiated
recognition
and
this
too
of
necessity
for
instance
no
experience
of
an
individual
however
near
he
may
stand
to
us
can
be
perfect
so
that
we
could
have
a
logical
right
to
make
a
complete
estimate
of
him
all
estimates
are
rash
and
must
be
so
finally
the
standard
by
which
we
measure
our
nature
is
not
of
unalterable
dimensions
we
have
moods
and
vacillations
and
yet
we
should
have
to
recognise
ourselves
as
a
fixed
standard
in
order
to
estimate
correctly
the
relation
of
any
thing
whatever
to
ourselves
from
this
it
will
perhaps
follow
that
we
should
make
no
judgments
at
all
if
one
could
only
live
without
making
estimations
without
having
likes
and
dislikes
for
all
dislike
is
connected
with
an
estimation
as
well
as
all
inclination
an
impulse
towards
or
away
from
anything
without
a
feeling
that
something
advantageous
is
desired
something
injurious
avoided
an
impulse
without
any
kind
of
conscious
valuation
of
the
worth
of
the
aim
does
not
exist
in
man
we
are
from
the
beginning
illogical
and
therefore
unjust
beings
can
recognise
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
inexplicable
discords
of
existence
error
about
life
necessary
for
every
belief
in
the
value
and
worthiness
of
life
is
based
on
vitiated
thought
it
is
only
possible
through
the
fact
that
sympathy
for
the
general
life
and
suffering
of
mankind
is
very
weakly
developed
in
the
individual
even
the
rarer
people
who
think
outside
themselves
do
not
contemplate
this
general
life
but
only
a
limited
part
of
it
if
one
understands
how
to
direct
one
attention
chiefly
to
the
exceptions
i
mean
to
the
highly
gifted
and
the
rich
souls
if
one
regards
the
production
of
these
as
the
aim
of
the
whole
and
rejoices
in
its
operation
then
one
may
believe
in
the
value
of
life
because
one
thereby
the
other
men
one
consequently
thinks
fallaciously
so
too
when
one
directs
one
attention
to
all
mankind
but
only
considers
species
of
impulses
in
them
the
less
egoistical
ones
and
excuses
them
with
regard
to
the
other
instincts
one
may
then
again
entertain
hopes
of
mankind
in
general
and
believe
so
far
in
the
value
of
life
consequently
in
this
case
also
through
fallaciousness
of
thought
let
one
however
behave
in
this
or
that
manner
with
such
behaviour
one
is
an
amongst
men
now
most
people
bear
life
without
any
considerable
grumbling
and
consequently
in
the
value
of
existence
but
precisely
because
each
one
is
solely
and
and
does
not
step
out
of
himself
like
those
exceptions
everything
is
imperceptible
to
them
or
at
most
seems
only
a
faint
shadow
therefore
on
this
alone
is
based
the
value
of
life
for
the
ordinary
everyday
man
that
he
regards
himself
as
more
important
than
the
world
the
great
lack
of
imagination
from
which
he
suffers
is
the
reason
why
he
can
not
enter
into
the
feelings
of
other
beings
and
therefore
sympathises
as
little
as
possible
with
their
fate
and
suffering
he
on
the
other
hand
who
really
sympathise
therewith
would
have
to
despair
of
the
value
of
life
were
he
to
succeed
in
comprehending
and
feeling
in
himself
the
general
consciousness
of
mankind
he
would
collapse
with
a
curse
on
existence
for
mankind
as
a
whole
has
goals
consequently
man
in
considering
his
whole
course
can
not
find
in
it
his
comfort
and
support
but
his
despair
if
in
all
that
he
does
he
considers
the
final
aimlessness
of
man
his
own
activity
assumes
in
his
eyes
the
character
of
wastefulness
but
to
feel
one
self
just
as
much
wasted
as
humanity
and
not
only
as
an
individual
as
we
see
the
single
blossom
of
nature
wasted
is
a
feeling
above
all
other
feelings
but
who
is
capable
of
it
assuredly
only
a
poet
and
poets
always
know
how
to
console
themselves
for
but
does
not
our
philosophy
thus
become
a
tragedy
does
not
truth
become
hostile
to
life
to
improvement
a
question
seems
to
weigh
upon
our
tongue
and
yet
hesitate
to
make
itself
heard
whether
one
consciously
remain
in
untruthfulness
or
supposing
one
were
to
do
this
would
not
death
be
preferable
for
there
is
no
longer
any
must
morality
in
so
far
as
it
had
any
must
or
shalt
has
been
destroyed
by
our
mode
of
contemplation
just
as
religion
has
been
destroyed
knowledge
can
only
allow
pleasure
and
pain
benefit
and
injury
to
subsist
as
motives
but
how
will
these
motives
agree
with
the
sense
of
truth
they
also
contain
errors
for
as
already
said
inclination
and
aversion
and
their
very
incorrect
determinations
practically
regulate
our
pleasure
and
pain
the
whole
of
human
life
is
deeply
immersed
in
untruthfulness
the
individual
can
not
draw
it
up
out
of
this
well
without
thereby
taking
a
deep
dislike
to
his
whole
past
without
finding
his
present
motives
those
of
honour
for
instance
inconsistent
and
without
opposing
scorn
and
disdain
to
the
passions
which
conduce
to
happiness
in
the
future
is
it
true
that
there
remains
but
one
sole
way
of
thinking
which
brings
after
it
despair
as
a
personal
experience
as
a
theoretical
result
a
philosophy
of
dissolution
disintegration
and
i
believe
that
the
decision
with
regard
to
the
of
the
knowledge
will
be
given
through
the
of
a
man
i
could
imagine
another
just
as
well
as
that
one
described
which
is
possible
in
certain
natures
by
means
of
which
a
life
would
arise
much
simpler
freer
from
emotions
than
is
the
present
one
so
that
though
at
first
indeed
the
old
motives
of
passionate
desire
might
still
have
strength
from
old
hereditary
habit
they
would
gradually
become
weaker
under
the
influence
of
purifying
knowledge
one
would
live
at
last
amongst
men
and
with
one
self
as
with
without
praise
reproach
or
agitation
feasting
one
eyes
as
if
it
were
a
upon
much
of
which
one
was
formerly
afraid
one
would
be
free
from
the
emphasis
and
would
no
longer
feel
the
goading
of
the
thought
that
one
is
not
only
nature
or
more
than
nature
certainly
as
already
remarked
a
good
temperament
would
be
necessary
for
this
an
even
mild
and
naturally
joyous
soul
a
disposition
which
would
not
always
need
to
be
on
its
guard
against
spite
and
sudden
outbreaks
and
would
not
convey
in
its
utterances
anything
of
a
grumbling
or
sudden
nature
those
vexatious
qualities
of
old
dogs
and
men
who
have
been
long
chained
up
on
the
contrary
a
man
from
whom
the
ordinary
fetters
of
life
have
so
far
fallen
that
he
continues
to
live
only
for
the
sake
of
ever
better
knowledge
must
be
able
to
renounce
without
envy
and
regret
much
indeed
almost
everything
that
is
precious
to
other
men
he
must
regard
as
the
and
the
most
desirable
condition
the
free
fearless
soaring
over
men
customs
laws
and
the
traditional
valuations
of
things
the
joy
of
this
condition
he
imparts
willingly
and
he
perhaps
nothing
else
to
impart
wherein
to
be
sure
there
is
more
privation
and
renunciation
if
nevertheless
more
is
demanded
from
him
he
will
point
with
a
friendly
shake
of
his
head
to
his
brother
the
free
man
of
action
and
will
perhaps
not
conceal
a
little
derision
for
as
regards
this
freedom
it
is
a
very
peculiar
case
second
division
the
history
of
the
moral
sentiments
advantages
of
psychological
that
reflection
on
the
human
or
according
to
the
learned
expression
psychological
observation
is
one
of
the
means
by
which
one
may
lighten
the
burden
of
life
that
exercise
in
this
art
produces
presence
of
mind
in
difficult
circumstances
in
the
midst
of
tiresome
surroundings
even
that
from
the
most
thorny
and
unpleasant
periods
of
one
own
life
one
may
gather
maxims
and
thereby
feel
a
little
better
all
this
was
believed
was
known
in
former
centuries
why
was
it
forgotten
by
our
century
when
in
germany
at
least
even
in
all
europe
the
poverty
of
psychological
observation
betrays
itself
by
many
signs
not
exactly
in
novels
tales
and
philosophical
treatises
they
are
the
work
of
exceptional
individuals
rather
in
the
judgments
on
public
events
and
personalities
but
above
all
there
is
a
lack
of
the
art
of
psychological
analysis
and
in
every
rank
of
society
in
which
a
great
deal
is
talked
about
men
but
nothing
about
why
do
we
allow
the
richest
and
most
harmless
subject
of
conversation
to
escape
us
why
are
not
the
great
masters
of
psychological
maxims
more
read
for
without
any
exaggeration
the
educated
man
in
europe
who
has
read
la
rochefoucauld
and
his
kindred
in
mind
and
art
is
rarely
found
and
still
more
rare
is
he
who
knows
them
and
does
not
blame
them
it
is
probable
however
that
even
this
exceptional
reader
will
find
much
less
pleasure
in
them
than
the
form
of
this
artist
should
afford
him
for
even
the
clearest
head
is
not
capable
of
rightly
estimating
the
art
of
shaping
and
polishing
maxims
unless
he
has
really
been
brought
up
to
it
and
has
competed
in
it
without
this
practical
teaching
one
deems
this
shaping
and
polishing
to
be
easier
than
it
is
one
has
not
a
sufficient
perception
of
fitness
and
charm
for
this
reason
the
present
readers
of
maxims
find
in
them
a
comparatively
small
pleasure
hardly
a
mouthful
of
pleasantness
so
that
they
resemble
the
people
who
generally
look
at
cameos
who
praise
because
they
can
not
love
and
are
very
ready
to
admire
but
still
more
ready
to
run
away
or
should
there
be
a
to
that
theory
that
places
psychological
observation
amongst
the
means
of
charming
curing
and
relieving
existence
should
one
have
sufficiently
convinced
one
self
of
the
unpleasant
consequences
of
this
art
to
divert
from
it
designedly
the
attention
of
him
who
is
educating
himself
in
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
certain
blind
belief
in
the
goodness
of
human
nature
an
innate
aversion
to
the
analysis
of
human
actions
a
kind
of
with
respect
to
the
nakedness
of
the
soul
may
really
be
more
desirable
for
the
general
of
a
man
than
that
quality
useful
in
isolated
cases
of
psychological
and
perhaps
the
belief
in
goodness
in
virtuous
men
and
deeds
in
an
abundance
of
impersonal
goodwill
in
the
world
has
made
men
better
inasmuch
as
it
has
made
them
less
distrustful
when
one
imitates
plutarch
heroes
with
enthusiasm
and
turns
with
disgust
from
a
suspicious
examination
of
the
motives
for
their
actions
it
is
not
truth
which
benefits
thereby
but
the
welfare
of
human
society
the
psychological
mistake
and
generally
speaking
the
insensibility
on
this
matter
helps
humanity
forwards
while
the
recognition
of
truth
gains
more
through
the
stimulating
power
of
hypothesis
than
la
rochefoucauld
has
said
in
his
preface
to
the
first
edition
of
his
et
maximes

ce
que
le
monde

fantôme
formé
par

on

those
other
french
masters
of
who
have
lately
been
joined

a

good
marksmen
who
again
and
again
hit
the
but
it
is
the
of
human
nature
their
art
arouses
astonishment
but
in
the
end
a
spectator
who
is
not
led
by
the
spirit
of
science
but
by
humane
intentions
will
probably
execrate
an
art
which
appears
to
implant
in
the
soul
the
sense
of
the
disparagement
and
suspicion
of
mankind
however
it
may
be
with
reckoning
and
in
the
present
condition
of
philosophy
the
awakening
of
moral
observation
is
necessary
humanity
can
no
longer
be
spared
the
cruel
sight
of
the
psychological
with
its
knives
and
forceps
for
here
rules
that
science
which
inquires
into
the
origin
and
history
of
the
moral
sentiments
and
which
in
its
progress
has
to
draw
up
and
solve
complicated
sociological
problems
the
older
philosophy
knows
the
latter
one
not
at
all
and
has
always
avoided
the
examination
of
the
origin
and
history
of
moral
sentiments
on
any
feeble
pretext
with
what
consequences
it
is
now
very
easy
to
see
after
it
has
been
shown
by
many
examples
how
the
mistakes
of
the
greatest
philosophers
generally
have
their
in
a
wrong
explanation
of
certain
human
actions
and
sensations
just
as
on
the
ground
of
an
erroneous
analysis
for
instance
that
of
the
unselfish
actions
a
false
ethic
is
built
up
then
to
harmonise
with
this
again
religion
and
mythological
confusion
are
brought
in
to
assist
and
finally
the
shades
of
these
dismal
spirits
fall
also
over
physics
and
the
general
mode
of
regarding
the
world
if
it
is
certain
however
that
superficiality
in
psychological
observation
has
laid
and
still
lays
the
most
dangerous
snares
for
human
judgments
and
conclusions
then
there
is
need
now
of
that
endurance
of
work
which
does
not
grow
weary
of
piling
stone
upon
stone
pebble
on
pebble
there
is
need
of
courage
not
to
be
ashamed
of
such
humble
work
and
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
scorn
and
this
is
also
true
numberless
single
observations
on
the
human
and
have
first
been
discovered
and
given
utterance
to
in
circles
of
society
which
were
accustomed
to
offer
sacrifice
therewith
to
a
clever
desire
to
please
and
not
to
scientific
knowledge
and
the
odour
of
that
old
home
of
the
moral
maxim
a
very
seductive
odour
has
attached
itself
almost
inseparably
to
the
whole
species
so
that
on
its
account
the
scientific
man
involuntarily
betrays
a
certain
distrust
of
this
species
and
its
earnestness
but
it
is
sufficient
to
point
to
the
consequences
for
already
it
begins
to
be
seen
what
results
of
a
serious
kind
spring
from
the
ground
of
psychological
observation
what
after
all
is
the
principal
axiom
to
which
the
boldest
and
coldest
thinker
the
author
of
the
book
the
origin
of
moral
has
attained
by
means
of
his
incisive
and
decisive
analyses
of
human
actions
the
moral
man
he
says
is
no
nearer
to
the
intelligible
metaphysical
world
than
is
the
physical
man
this
theory
hardened
and
sharpened
under
the
of
historical
knowledge
may
some
time
or
other
perhaps
in
some
future
period
serve
as
the
axe
which
is
applied
to
the
root
of
the
metaphysical
need
of
man
whether
as
a
blessing
than
a
curse
to
the
general
welfare
it
is
not
easy
to
say
but
in
any
case
as
a
theory
with
the
most
important
consequences
at
once
fruitful
and
terrible
and
looking
into
the
world
with
that
which
all
great
knowledge
possesses
how
far
it
must
remain
for
ever
undecided
whether
psychological
observation
is
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
to
man
but
it
is
certain
that
it
is
necessary
because
science
can
not
do
without
it
science
however
has
no
consideration
for
ultimate
purposes
any
more
than
nature
has
but
just
as
the
latter
occasionally
achieves
things
of
the
greatest
suitableness
without
intending
to
do
so
so
also
true
science
as
the
of
nature
in
ideas
will
occasionally
and
in
many
ways
further
the
usefulness
and
welfare
of
man
also
without
intending
to
do
but
whoever
feels
too
chilled
by
the
breath
of
such
a
reflection
has
perhaps
too
little
fire
in
himself
let
him
look
around
him
meanwhile
and
he
will
become
aware
of
illnesses
which
have
need
of
and
of
men
who
are
so
kneaded
together
of
heat
and
spirit
that
they
can
hardly
find
an
atmosphere
that
is
cold
and
biting
enough
moreover
as
individuals
and
nations
that
are
too
serious
have
need
of
frivolities
as
others
too
mobile
and
excitable
have
need
occasionally
of
heavily
oppressing
burdens
for
the
sake
of
their
health
should
not
we
the
more
people
of
this
age
that
grows
visibly
more
and
more
inflamed
seize
all
quenching
and
cooling
means
that
exist
in
order
that
we
may
at
least
remain
as
constant
harmless
and
moderate
as
we
still
are
and
thus
perhaps
serve
some
time
or
other
as
mirror
and
for
this
age
the
fable
of
intelligible
the
history
of
the
sentiments
by
means
of
which
we
make
a
person
responsible
consists
of
the
following
principal
phases
first
all
single
actions
are
called
good
or
bad
without
any
regard
to
their
motives
but
only
on
account
of
the
useful
or
injurious
consequences
which
result
for
the
community
but
soon
the
origin
of
these
distinctions
is
forgotten
and
it
is
deemed
that
the
qualities
good
or
bad
are
contained
in
the
action
itself
without
regard
to
its
consequences
by
the
same
error
according
to
which
language
describes
the
stone
as
hard
the
tree
as
green
with
which
in
short
the
result
is
regarded
as
the
cause
then
the
goodness
or
badness
is
implanted
in
the
motive
and
the
action
in
itself
is
looked
upon
as
morally
ambiguous
mankind
even
goes
further
and
applies
the
predicate
good
or
bad
no
longer
to
single
motives
but
to
the
whole
nature
of
an
individual
out
of
whom
the
motive
grows
as
the
plant
grows
out
of
the
earth
thus
in
turn
man
is
made
responsible
for
his
operations
then
for
his
actions
then
for
his
motives
and
finally
for
his
nature
eventually
it
is
discovered
that
even
this
nature
can
not
be
responsible
inasmuch
as
it
is
an
absolutely
necessary
consequence
concreted
out
of
the
elements
and
influences
of
past
and
present
things
that
man
therefore
can
not
be
made
responsible
for
anything
neither
for
his
nature
nor
his
motives
nor
his
actions
nor
his
effects
it
has
therewith
come
to
be
recognised
that
the
history
of
moral
valuations
is
at
the
same
time
the
history
of
an
error
the
error
of
responsibility
which
is
based
upon
the
error
of
the
freedom
of
will
schopenhauer
thus
decided
against
it
because
certain
actions
bring
ill
humour
consciousness
of
guilt
in
their
train
there
must
be
a
responsibility
for
there
would
be
for
this
ill
humour
if
not
only
all
human
actions
were
not
done
of
necessity
which
is
actually
the
case
and
also
the
belief
of
this
philosopher
but
man
himself
from
the
same
necessity
is
precisely
the
that
he
is
which
schopenhauer
denies
from
the
fact
of
that
ill
humour
schopenhauer
thinks
he
can
prove
a
liberty
which
man
must
somehow
have
had
not
with
regard
to
actions
but
with
regard
to
nature
liberty
therefore
to
thus
or
otherwise
not
to
thus
or
otherwise
from
the
the
sphere
of
freedom
and
responsibility
there
results
in
his
opinion
the
the
sphere
of
strict
causality
necessity
and
irresponsibility
this
ill
humour
is
apparently
directed
to
the
in
so
far
it
is
erroneous
but
in
reality
it
is
directed
to
the
which
is
the
deed
of
a
free
will
the
fundamental
cause
of
the
existence
of
an
individual
man
becomes
that
which
he
to
be
his
will
is
anterior
to
his
existence
here
the
mistaken
conclusion
is
drawn
that
from
the
fact
of
the
ill
humour
the
justification
the
reasonable
of
this
ill
humour
is
presupposed
and
starting
from
this
mistaken
conclusion
schopenhauer
arrives
at
his
fantastic
sequence
of
the
intelligible
freedom
but
the
ill
humour
after
the
deed
is
not
necessarily
reasonable
indeed
it
is
assuredly
not
reasonable
for
it
is
based
upon
the
erroneous
presumption
that
the
action
need
have
inevitably
followed
therefore
it
is
only
because
man
himself
to
be
free
not
because
he
is
free
that
he
experiences
remorse
and
pricks
of
conscience
moreover
this
ill
humour
is
a
habit
that
can
be
broken
off
in
many
people
it
is
entirely
absent
in
connection
with
actions
where
others
experience
it
it
is
a
very
changeable
thing
and
one
which
is
connected
with
the
development
of
customs
and
culture
and
probably
only
existing
during
a
comparatively
short
period
of
the
world
history
nobody
is
responsible
for
his
actions
nobody
for
his
nature
to
judge
is
identical
with
being
unjust
this
also
applies
when
an
individual
judges
himself
the
theory
is
as
clear
as
sunlight
and
yet
every
one
prefers
to
go
back
into
the
shadow
and
the
untruth
for
fear
of
the
consequences
the
the
beast
in
us
wishes
to
be
deceived
morality
is
a
lie
of
necessity
in
order
that
we
may
not
be
torn
in
pieces
by
it
without
the
errors
which
lie
in
the
assumption
of
morality
man
would
have
remained
an
animal
thus
however
he
has
considered
himself
as
something
higher
and
has
laid
strict
laws
upon
himself
therefore
he
hates
the
grades
which
have
remained
nearer
to
animalness
whereby
the
former
scorn
of
the
slave
as
a
is
to
be
explained
as
a
fact
the
unchangeable
that
the
character
is
unchangeable
is
not
true
in
a
strict
sense
this
favourite
theory
means
rather
that
during
the
short
lifetime
of
an
individual
the
new
influencing
motives
can
not
penetrate
deeply
enough
to
destroy
the
ingrained
marks
of
many
thousands
of
years
but
if
one
were
to
imagine
a
man
of
eighty
thousand
years
one
would
have
in
him
an
absolutely
changeable
character
so
that
a
number
of
different
individuals
would
gradually
develop
out
of
him
the
shortness
of
human
life
misleads
us
into
forming
many
erroneous
ideas
about
the
qualities
of
man
the
order
of
possessions
and
the
hierarchy
of
possessions
according
as
this
or
the
other
is
coveted
by
a
lower
higher
or
highest
egoism
now
decides
what
is
moral
or
immoral
to
prefer
a
lesser
good
for
instance
the
gratification
of
the
senses
to
a
more
highly
valued
good
for
instance
health
is
accounted
immoral
and
also
to
prefer
luxury
to
liberty
the
hierarchy
of
possessions
however
is
not
fixed
and
equal
at
all
times
if
any
one
prefers
vengeance
to
justice
he
is
moral
according
to
the
standard
of
an
earlier
civilisation
but
immoral
according
to
the
present
one
to
be
immoral
therefore
denotes
that
an
individual
has
not
felt
or
not
felt
sufficiently
strongly
the
higher
finer
spiritual
motives
which
have
come
in
with
a
new
culture
it
marks
one
who
has
remained
behind
but
only
according
to
the
difference
of
degrees
the
order
of
possessions
itself
is
raised
and
lowered
according
to
a
moral
point
of
view
but
each
time
that
it
is
fixed
it
supplies
the
decision
as
to
whether
an
action
is
moral
or
immoral
cruel
people
as
those
who
have
remained
people
who
are
cruel
nowadays
must
be
accounted
for
by
us
as
the
grades
of
earlier
civilisations
which
have
survived
here
are
exposed
those
deeper
formations
in
the
mountain
of
humanity
which
usually
remain
concealed
they
are
backward
people
whose
brains
through
all
manner
of
accidents
in
the
course
of
inheritance
have
not
been
developed
in
so
delicate
and
manifold
a
way
they
show
us
what
we
all
and
horrify
us
but
they
themselves
are
as
little
responsible
as
is
a
block
of
granite
for
being
granite
there
must
too
be
grooves
and
twists
in
our
brains
which
answer
to
that
condition
of
mind
as
in
the
form
of
certain
human
organs
there
are
supposed
to
be
traces
of
a
but
these
grooves
and
twists
are
no
longer
the
bed
through
which
the
stream
of
our
sensation
flows
gratitude
and
the
reason
why
the
powerful
man
is
grateful
is
this
his
benefactor
through
the
benefit
he
confers
has
mistaken
and
intruded
into
the
sphere
of
the
powerful
man
now
the
latter
in
return
penetrates
into
the
sphere
of
the
benefactor
by
the
act
of
gratitude
it
is
a
milder
form
of
revenge
without
the
satisfaction
of
gratitude
the
powerful
man
would
have
shown
himself
powerless
and
would
have
been
reckoned
as
such
ever
after
therefore
every
society
of
the
good
which
originally
meant
the
powerful
places
gratitude
amongst
the
first
swift
propounded
the
maxim
that
men
were
grateful
in
the
same
proportion
as
they
were
revengeful
the
twofold
early
history
of
good
and
the
conception
of
good
and
evil
has
a
twofold
early
history
namely
in
the
soul
of
the
ruling
tribes
and
castes
whoever
has
the
power
of
returning
good
for
good
evil
for
evil
and
really
practises
requital
and
who
is
therefore
grateful
and
revengeful
is
called
good
whoever
is
powerless
and
unable
to
requite
is
reckoned
as
bad
as
a
good
man
one
is
reckoned
among
the
good
a
community
which
has
common
feelings
because
the
single
individuals
are
bound
to
one
another
by
the
sense
of
requital
as
a
bad
man
one
belongs
to
the
bad
to
a
party
of
subordinate
powerless
people
who
have
no
common
feeling
the
good
are
a
caste
the
bad
are
a
mass
like
dust
good
and
bad
have
for
a
long
time
meant
the
same
thing
as
noble
and
base
master
and
slave
on
the
other
hand
the
enemy
is
not
looked
upon
as
evil
he
can
requite
in
homer
the
trojan
and
the
greek
are
both
good
it
is
not
the
one
who
injures
us
but
the
one
who
is
despicable
who
is
called
bad
good
is
inherited
in
the
community
of
the
good
it
is
impossible
that
a
bad
man
could
spring
from
such
good
soil
if
nevertheless
one
of
the
good
ones
does
something
which
is
unworthy
of
the
good
refuge
is
sought
in
excuses
the
guilt
is
thrown
upon
a
god
for
instance
it
is
said
that
he
has
struck
the
good
man
with
blindness
and
in
the
soul
of
the
oppressed
and
powerless
here
every
man
is
looked
upon
as
hostile
inconsiderate
rapacious
cruel
cunning
be
he
noble
or
base
evil
is
the
distinguishing
word
for
man
even
for
every
conceivable
living
creature
for
a
god
human
divine
is
the
same
thing
as
devilish
evil
the
signs
of
goodness
helpfulness
pity
are
looked
upon
with
fear
as
spite
the
prelude
to
a
terrible
result
stupefaction
and
in
short
as
refined
malice
with
such
a
disposition
in
the
individual
a
community
could
hardly
exist
or
at
most
it
could
exist
only
in
its
crudest
form
so
that
in
all
places
where
this
conception
of
good
and
evil
obtains
the
downfall
of
the
single
individuals
of
their
tribes
and
races
is
at
our
present
civilisation
has
grown
up
on
the
soil
of
the
tribes
and
castes
sympathy
stronger
than
there
are
cases
when
sympathy
is
stronger
than
actual
suffering
for
instance
we
are
more
pained
when
one
of
our
friends
is
guilty
of
something
shameful
than
when
we
do
it
ourselves
for
one
thing
we
have
more
faith
in
the
purity
of
his
character
than
he
has
himself
then
our
love
for
him
probably
on
account
of
this
very
faith
is
stronger
than
his
love
for
himself
and
even
if
his
egoism
suffers
more
thereby
than
our
egoism
inasmuch
as
it
has
to
bear
more
of
the
bad
consequences
of
his
fault
the
in
us
this
word
is
not
to
be
taken
too
seriously
but
only
as
a
modification
of
the
expression
is
more
deeply
wounded
by
his
guilt
than
is
the
in
him
there
are
people
who
become
hypochondriacal
through
their
sympathy
and
concern
for
another
person
the
kind
of
sympathy
which
results
therefrom
is
nothing
but
a
disease
thus
there
is
also
a
christian
hypochondria
which
afflicts
those
solitary
people
who
keep
constantly
before
their
eyes
the
sufferings
and
death
of
christ
economy
of
goodness
and
love
as
the
most
healing
herbs
and
powers
in
human
intercourse
are
such
costly
discoveries
that
one
would
wish
as
much
economy
as
possible
to
be
exercised
in
the
employment
of
these
balsamic
means
but
this
is
impossible
the
economy
of
goodness
is
the
dream
of
the
most
daring
utopians
amongst
the
small
but
countlessly
frequent
and
therefore
very
effective
things
to
which
science
should
pay
more
attention
than
to
the
great
rare
things
is
to
be
reckoned
goodwill
i
mean
that
exhibition
of
a
friendly
disposition
in
intercourse
that
smiling
eye
that
clasp
of
the
hand
that
cheerfulness
with
which
almost
all
human
actions
are
usually
accompanied
every
teacher
every
official
adds
this
to
whatever
is
his
duty
it
is
the
perpetual
occupation
of
humanity
and
at
the
same
time
the
waves
of
its
light
in
which
everything
grows
in
the
narrowest
circle
namely
within
the
family
life
blooms
and
flourishes
only
through
that
goodwill
kindliness
friendliness
the
courtesy
of
the
heart
are
streams
of
impulses
and
have
given
far
more
powerful
assistance
to
culture
than
even
those
much
more
famous
demonstrations
which
are
called
pity
mercy
and
but
they
are
thought
little
of
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
not
much
that
is
in
them
the
of
these
small
doses
is
nevertheless
mighty
their
united
force
is
amongst
the
strongest
forces
thus
one
finds
much
more
happiness
in
the
world
than
sad
eyes
see
if
one
only
reckons
rightly
and
does
not
forget
all
those
moments
of
comfort
in
which
every
day
is
rich
even
in
the
most
harried
of
human
lives
the
wish
to
arouse
in
the
most
remarkable
passage
of
his
auto
portrait
first
printed
in
la
rochefoucauld
assuredly
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
when
he
warns
all
sensible
people
against
pity
when
he
advises
them
to
leave
that
to
those
orders
of
the
people
who
have
need
of
passion
because
it
is
not
ruled
by
reason
and
to
reach
the
point
of
helping
the
suffering
and
acting
energetically
in
an
accident
while
pity
according
to
his
and
plato
judgment
weakens
the
soul
certainly
we
should
pity
but
take
good
care
not
to
it
for
the
unfortunate
are
so
that
to
them
the
exhibition
of
pity
is
the
greatest
good
in
the
world
one
can
perhaps
give
a
more
forcible
warning
against
this
feeling
of
pity
if
one
looks
upon
that
need
of
the
unfortunate
not
exactly
as
stupidity
and
lack
of
intellect
a
kind
of
mental
derangement
which
misfortune
brings
with
it
and
as
such
indeed
la
rochefoucauld
appears
to
regard
it
but
as
something
quite
different
and
more
serious
observe
children
who
cry
and
scream
to
be
pitied
and
therefore
wait
for
the
moment
when
they
will
be
noticed
live
in
intercourse
with
the
sick
and
mentally
oppressed
and
ask
yourself
whether
that
ready
complaining
and
whimpering
that
making
a
show
of
misfortune
does
not
at
bottom
aim
at
the
spectators
miserable
the
pity
which
the
spectators
then
exhibit
is
in
so
far
a
consolation
for
the
weak
and
suffering
in
that
the
latter
recognise
therein
that
they
still
one
power
in
spite
of
their
weakness
power
of
giving
the
unfortunate
derives
a
sort
of
pleasure
from
this
feeling
of
superiority
of
which
the
exhibition
of
pity
makes
him
conscious
his
imagination
is
exalted
he
is
still
powerful
enough
to
give
the
world
pain
thus
the
thirst
for
pity
is
the
thirst
for
and
that
moreover
at
the
expense
of
his
it
shows
man
in
the
whole
inconsiderateness
of
his
own
dear
self
but
not
exactly
in
his
stupidity
as
la
rochefoucauld
thinks
in
of
all
questions
asked
and
of
all
answers
given
are
intended
to
cause
the
interlocutor
a
little
pain
for
this
reason
so
many
people
pine
for
company
it
enables
them
to
feel
their
power
there
is
a
powerful
charm
of
life
in
such
countless
but
very
small
doses
in
which
malice
makes
itself
felt
just
as
goodwill
spread
in
the
same
way
throughout
the
world
is
the
means
of
healing
but
are
there
many
honest
people
who
will
admit
that
it
is
pleasing
to
give
pain
that
one
not
infrequently
amuses
one
self
and
amuses
one
self
very
well
in
causing
mortifications
to
others
at
least
in
thought
and
firing
off
at
them
the
of
petty
malice
most
people
are
too
dishonest
and
a
few
are
too
good
to
know
anything
of
this
these
will
always
deny
that
prosper
mérimée
is
right
when
he
says
aussi
a
rien
de
plus
commun
que
de
faire
le
mal
pour
le
plaisir
de
le
how
appearance
becomes
the
actor
finally
reaches
such
a
point
that
even
in
the
deepest
sorrow
he
can
not
cease
from
thinking
about
the
impression
made
by
his
own
person
and
the
general
scenic
effect
for
instance
even
at
the
funeral
of
his
child
he
will
weep
over
his
own
sorrow
and
its
expression
like
one
of
his
own
audience
the
hypocrite
who
always
plays
one
and
the
same
part
ceases
at
last
to
be
a
hypocrite
for
instance
priests
who
as
young
men
are
generally
conscious
or
unconscious
hypocrites
become
at
last
natural
and
are
then
really
without
any
affectation
just
priests
or
if
the
father
does
not
succeed
so
far
perhaps
the
son
does
who
makes
use
of
his
father
progress
and
inherits
his
habits
if
any
one
long
and
obstinately
desires
to
something
he
finds
it
difficult
at
last
to
anything
else
the
profession
of
almost
every
individual
even
of
the
artist
begins
with
hypocrisy
with
an
imitating
from
without
with
a
copying
of
the
effective
he
who
always
wears
the
mask
of
a
friendly
expression
must
eventually
obtain
a
power
over
dispositions
without
which
the
expression
of
friendliness
is
not
to
be
compelled
and
finally
these
again
obtain
a
power
over
him
he
the
point
of
honour
in
in
all
great
deceivers
one
thing
is
noteworthy
to
which
they
owe
their
power
in
the
actual
act
of
deception
with
all
their
preparations
the
dreadful
voice
expression
and
mien
in
the
midst
of
their
effective
scenery
they
are
overcome
by
their
in
it
is
this
then
which
speaks
so
wonderfully
and
persuasively
to
the
spectators
the
founders
of
religions
are
distinguished
from
those
great
deceivers
in
that
they
never
awake
from
their
condition
of
or
at
times
but
very
rarely
they
have
an
enlightened
moment
when
doubt
overpowers
them
they
generally
console
themselves
however
by
ascribing
these
enlightened
moments
to
the
influence
of
the
evil
one
there
must
be
in
order
that
this
and
that
may
great
for
men
believe
in
the
truth
of
everything
that
is
visibly
strongly
believed
in
the
nominal
degrees
of
one
of
the
commonest
mistakes
is
this
because
some
one
is
truthful
and
honest
towards
us
he
must
speak
the
truth
thus
the
child
believes
in
its
parents
judgment
the
christian
in
the
assertions
of
the
founder
of
the
church
in
the
same
way
men
refuse
to
admit
that
all
those
things
which
men
defended
in
former
ages
with
the
sacrifice
of
life
and
happiness
were
nothing
but
errors
it
is
even
said
perhaps
that
they
were
degrees
of
the
truth
but
what
is
really
meant
is
that
when
a
man
has
honestly
believed
in
something
and
has
fought
and
died
for
his
faith
it
would
really
be
too
if
he
had
only
been
inspired
by
an
error
such
a
thing
seems
a
contradiction
of
eternal
justice
therefore
the
heart
of
sensitive
man
ever
enunciates
against
his
head
the
axiom
between
moral
action
and
intellectual
insight
there
must
absolutely
be
a
necessary
connection
it
is
unfortunately
otherwise
for
there
is
no
eternal
justice
why
do
people
mostly
speak
the
truth
in
daily
life
assuredly
not
because
a
god
has
forbidden
falsehood
but
firstly
because
it
is
more
convenient
as
falsehood
requires
invention
deceit
and
memory
as
swift
says
he
who
tells
a
lie
is
not
sensible
how
great
a
task
he
undertakes
for
in
order
to
uphold
one
lie
he
must
invent
twenty
others
therefore
because
it
is
advantageous
in
upright
circumstances
to
say
straight
out
i
want
this
i
have
done
that
and
so
on
because
in
other
words
the
path
of
compulsion
and
authority
is
surer
than
that
of
cunning
but
if
a
child
has
been
brought
up
in
complicated
domestic
circumstances
he
employs
falsehood
naturally
and
unconsciously
says
whatever
best
suits
his
interests
a
sense
of
truth
and
a
hatred
of
falsehood
are
quite
foreign
and
unknown
to
him
and
so
he
lies
in
all
innocence
throwing
suspicion
on
morality
for
faith
no
power
can
be
maintained
when
it
is
only
represented
by
hypocrites
no
matter
how
many
worldly
elements
the
catholic
church
possesses
its
strength
lies
in
those
still
numerous
priestly
natures
who
render
life
hard
and
full
of
meaning
for
themselves
and
whose
glance
and
worn
bodies
speak
of
nocturnal
vigils
hunger
burning
prayers
and
perhaps
even
of
scourging
these
move
men
and
inspire
them
with
fear
what
if
it
were
to
live
thus
this
is
the
terrible
question
which
their
aspect
brings
to
the
lips
whilst
they
spread
this
doubt
they
always
uprear
another
pillar
of
their
power
even
the
does
not
dare
to
withstand
such
unselfishness
with
hard
words
of
truth
and
to
say
thyself
deceived
deceive
not
others
only
the
difference
of
views
divides
them
from
him
certainly
no
difference
of
goodness
or
badness
but
men
generally
treat
unjustly
that
which
they
do
not
like
thus
we
speak
of
the
cunning
and
the
infamous
art
of
the
jesuits
but
overlook
the
which
every
individual
jesuit
practises
and
the
fact
that
the
lightened
manner
of
life
preached
by
jesuit
books
is
by
no
means
for
their
benefit
but
for
that
of
the
laity
we
may
even
ask
whether
with
precisely
similar
tactics
and
organisation
we
enlightened
ones
would
make
equally
good
tools
equally
admirable
through
indefatigableness
and
renunciation
victory
of
knowledge
over
radical
it
is
of
great
advantage
to
him
who
desires
to
be
wise
to
have
witnessed
for
a
time
the
spectacle
of
a
thoroughly
evil
and
degenerate
man
it
is
false
like
the
contrary
spectacle
but
for
whole
long
periods
it
held
the
mastery
and
its
roots
have
even
extended
and
ramified
themselves
to
us
and
our
world
in
order
to
understand
we
must
understand
but
then
in
order
to
mount
higher
we
must
rise
above
it
we
recognise
then
that
there
exist
no
sins
in
the
metaphysical
sense
but
in
the
same
sense
also
no
virtues
we
recognise
that
the
entire
domain
of
ethical
ideas
is
perpetually
tottering
that
there
are
higher
and
deeper
conceptions
of
good
and
evil
of
moral
and
immoral
he
who
does
not
desire
much
more
from
things
than
a
knowledge
of
them
easily
makes
peace
with
his
soul
and
will
make
a
mistake
or
commit
a
sin
as
the
world
calls
it
at
the
most
from
ignorance
but
hardly
from
covetousness
he
will
no
longer
wish
to
excommunicate
and
exterminate
desires
but
his
only
his
wholly
dominating
ambition
to
as
well
as
possible
at
all
times
will
make
him
cool
and
will
soften
all
the
savageness
in
his
disposition
moreover
he
has
been
freed
from
a
number
of
tormenting
conceptions
he
has
no
more
feeling
at
the
mention
of
the
words
punishments
of
hell
sinfulness
incapacity
for
good
he
recognises
in
them
only
the
vanishing
of
false
views
of
the
world
and
of
life
morality
as
the
of
a
good
author
who
really
has
his
heart
in
his
work
wishes
that
some
one
could
come
and
annihilate
him
by
representing
the
same
thing
in
a
clearer
way
and
answering
without
more
ado
the
problems
therein
proposed
the
loving
girl
wishes
she
could
prove
the
faithfulness
of
her
love
by
the
unfaithfulness
of
her
beloved
the
soldier
hopes
to
die
on
the
field
of
battle
for
his
victorious
fatherland
for
his
loftiest
desires

in
the
victory
of
his
country
the
mother
gives
to
the
child
that
of
which
she
deprives
herself
sleep
the
best
food
sometimes
her
health
and
fortune
but
are
all
these
conditions
are
these
deeds
of
morality
because
to
use
schopenhauer
expression
they
are
impossible
and
yet
performed
is
it
not
clear
that
in
all
four
cases
the
individual
loves
of
himself
a
thought
a
desire
a
production
better
than
else
of
himself
that
he
therefore
divides
his
nature
and
to
one
part
sacrifices
all
the
rest
is
it
something
different
when
an
obstinate
man
says
i
would
rather
be
shot
than
move
a
step
out
of
my
way
for
this
man
the
for
wish
inclination
longing
is
present
in
all
the
instances
mentioned
to
give
way
to
it
with
all
its
consequences
is
certainly
not
in
ethics
man
does
not
consider
himself
as
but
as
what
one
may
one
may
promise
actions
but
no
sentiments
for
these
are
involuntary
whoever
promises
to
love
or
hate
a
person
or
be
faithful
to
him
for
ever
promises
something
which
is
not
within
his
power
he
can
certainly
promise
such
actions
as
are
usually
the
results
of
love
hate
or
fidelity
but
which
may
also
spring
from
other
motives
for
many
ways
and
motives
lead
to
one
and
the
same
action
the
promise
to
love
some
one
for
ever
is
therefore
really
so
long
as
i
love
you
i
will
act
towards
you
in
a
loving
way
if
i
cease
to
love
you
you
will
still
receive
the
same
treatment
from
me
although
inspired
by
other
motives
so
that
our
will
still
be
deluded
into
the
belief
that
our
love
is
unchanged
and
ever
the
same
one
promises
therefore
the
continuation
of
the
semblance
of
love
when
without
one
speaks
vows
of
eternal
love
intellect
and
one
must
have
a
good
memory
to
be
able
to
keep
a
given
promise
one
must
have
a
strong
power
of
imagination
to
be
able
to
feel
pity
so
closely
is
morality
bound
to
the
goodness
of
the
intellect
to
wish
for
revenge
and
to
take
to
have
a
revengeful
thought
and
to
carry
it
into
effect
is
to
have
a
violent
attack
of
fever
which
passes
off
however
but
to
have
a
revengeful
thought
without
the
strength
and
courage
to
carry
it
out
is
a
chronic
disease
a
poisoning
of
body
and
soul
which
we
have
to
bear
about
with
us
morality
which
only
takes
intentions
into
account
considers
the
two
cases
as
equal
usually
the
former
case
is
regarded
as
the
worse
because
of
the
evil
consequences
which
may
perhaps
result
from
the
deed
of

both
estimates

the
power
of
waiting
is
so
difficult
that
even
great
poets
have
not
disdained
to
take
incapability
of
waiting
as
the
motive
for
their
works
thus
shakespeare
in
othello
or
sophocles
in
ajax
to
whom
suicide
had
he
been
able
to
let
his
feelings
cool
down
for
one
day
would
no
longer
have
seemed
necessary
as
the
oracle
intimated
he
would
probably
have
snapped
his
fingers
at
the
terrible
whisperings
of
wounded
vanity
and
said
to
himself
who
has
not
already
in
my
circumstances
mistaken
a
fool
for
a
hero
is
it
something
so
very
extraordinary
on
the
contrary
it
is
something
very
commonly
human
ajax
might
allow
himself
that
consolation
passion
will
not
wait
the
tragedy
in
the
lives
of
great
men
frequently
lies
in
their
conflict
with
the
times
and
the
baseness
of
their
but
in
their
incapacity
of
postponing
their
work
for
a
year
or
two
they
can
not
wait
in
all
duels
advising
friends
have
one
thing
to
decide
namely
whether
the
parties
concerned
can
still
wait
awhile
if
this
is
not
the
case
then
a
duel
is
advisable
inasmuch
as
each
of
the
two
says
either
i
continue
to
live
and
that
other
man
must
die
immediately
or
in
such
case
waiting
would
mean
a
prolonged
suffering
of
the
terrible
martyrdom
of
wounded
honour
in
the
face
of
the
insulter
and
this
may
entail
more
suffering
than
life
is
worth
revelling
in
coarser
individuals
who
feel
themselves
insulted
make
out
the
insult
to
be
as
great
as
possible
and
relate
the
affair
in
greatly
exaggerated
language
in
order
to
be
able
to
revel
thoroughly
in
the
rarely
awakened
feelings
of
hatred
and
revenge
the
value
of
in
order
to
maintain
their
in
their
own
eyes
and
a
certain
thoroughness
of
action
not
a
few
men
perhaps
even
the
majority
find
it
absolutely
necessary
to
run
down
and
disparage
all
their
acquaintances
but
as
mean
natures
are
numerous
and
since
it
is
very
important
whether
they
possess
that
thoroughness
or
lose
it
hence
the
man
in
a
we
must
beware
of
one
who
is
in
a
passion
against
us
as
of
one
who
has
once
sought
our
life
for
the
fact
that
we
still
live
is
due
to
the
absence
of
power
to
kill
if
looks
would
suffice
we
should
have
been
dead
long
ago
it
is
a
piece
of
rough
civilisation
to
force
some
one
into
silence
by
the
exhibition
of
physical
savageness
and
the
inspiring
of
fear
that
cold
glance
which
exalted
persons
employ
towards
their
servants
is
also
a
relic
of
that
caste
division
between
man
and
man
a
piece
of
rough
antiquity
women
the
preservers
of
ancient
things
have
also
faithfully
retained
this
of
an
ancient
habit
whither
honesty
can
somebody
had
the
bad
habit
of
occasionally
talking
quite
frankly
about
the
motives
of
his
actions
which
were
as
good
and
as
bad
as
the
motives
of
most
men
he
first
gave
offence
then
aroused
suspicion
was
then
gradually
excluded
from
society
and
declared
a
social
outlaw
until
at
last
justice
remembered
such
an
abandoned
creature
on
occasions
when
it
would
otherwise
have
had
no
eyes
or
would
have
closed
them
the
lack
of
power
to
hold
his
tongue
concerning
the
common
secret
and
the
irresponsible
tendency
to
see
what
no
one
wishes
to
see
himself
brought
him
to
a
prison
and
an
early
death
punishable
but
never
our
crime
against
criminals
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
treat
them
like
rascals
of
every
virtue
has
its
privileges
for
example
that
of
contributing
its
own
little
faggot
to
the
scaffold
of
every
condemned
man
morality
and
it
is
not
only
the
spectators
of
a
deed
who
frequently
judge
of
its
morality
or
immorality
according
to
its
consequences
but
the
doer
of
the
deed
himself
does
so
for
the
motives
and
intentions
are
seldom
sufficiently
clear
and
simple
and
sometimes
memory
itself
seems
clouded
by
the
consequences
of
the
deed
so
that
one
ascribes
the
deed
to
false
motives
or
looks
upon
unessential
motives
as
essential
success
often
gives
an
action
the
whole
honest
glamour
of
a
good
conscience
failure
casts
the
shadow
of
remorse
over
the
most
estimable
deed
hence
arises
the
practice
of
the
politician
who
thinks
only
grant
me
success
with
that
i
bring
all
honest
souls
over
to
my
side
and
make
myself
honest
in
my
own
eyes
in
the
same
way
success
must
replace
a
better
argument
many
educated
people
still
believe
that
the
triumph
of
christianity
over
greek
philosophy
is
a
proof
of
the
greater
truthfulness
of
the
former
although
in
this
case
it
is
only
the
coarser
and
more
powerful
that
has
triumphed
over
the
more
spiritual
and
delicate
which
possesses
the
greater
truth
may
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
the
awakening
sciences
have
agreed
with
epicurus
philosophy
on
point
after
point
but
on
point
after
point
have
rejected
christianity
love
and
why
do
we
love
to
the
disadvantage
of
justice
and
say
the
most
beautiful
things
about
it
as
if
it
were
something
very
much
higher
than
the
latter
is
it
not
visibly
more
stupid
than
justice
certainly
but
precisely
for
that
reason
all
the

every
one
it
is
blind
and
possesses
an
abundant
cornucopia
out
of
which
it
distributes
its
gifts
to
all
even
if
they
do
not
deserve
them
even
if
they
express
no
thanks
for
them
it
is
as
impartial
as
the
rain
which
according
to
the
bible
and
experience
makes
not
only
the
unjust
but
also
occasionally
the
just

the
skin
how
is
it
that
every
execution
offends
us
more
than
does
a
murder
it
is
the
coldness
of
the
judges
the
painful
preparations
the
conviction
that
a
human
being
is
here
being
used
as
a
warning
to
scare
others
for
the
guilt

not
punished
even
if

existed
it
lies

therefore
he

the

reach

and
influence
our
whole

not

the
martyr
in
spite
of
there
was
a
man
belonging
to
a
party
who
was
too
nervous
and
cowardly
ever
to
contradict
his
comrades
they
made
use
of
him
for
everything
they
demanded
everything
from
him
because
he
was
more
afraid
of
the
bad
opinion
of
his
companions
than
of
death
itself
his
was
a
miserable
feeble
soul
they
recognised
this
and
on
the
ground
of
these
qualities
they
made
a
hero
of
him
and
finally
even
a
martyr
although
the
coward
inwardly
always
said
no
with
his
lips
he
always
said
yes
even
on
the
scaffold
when
he
was
about
to
die
for
the
opinions
of
his
party
for
beside
him
stood
one
of
his
old
companions
who
so
tyrannised
over
him
by
word
and
look
that
he
really
suffered
death
in
the
most
respectable
manner
and
has
ever
since
been
celebrated
as
a
martyr
and
a
great
character
i
the
one
will
seldom
go
wrong
if
one
attributes
extreme
actions
to
vanity
average
ones
to
habit
and
petty
ones
to
fear
misunderstanding
concerning
whoever
has
known
immorality
in
connection
with
pleasure
as
is
the
case
with
a
man
who
has
a
youth
behind
him
imagines
that
virtue
must
be
connected
with
absence
of
whoever
on
the
contrary
has
been
much
plagued
by
his
passions
and
vices
longs
to
find
in
virtue
peace
and
the
soul
happiness
hence
it
is
possible
for
two
virtuous
persons
not
to
understand
each
other
at
all
the
the
ascetic
makes
a
necessity
of
virtue
transferring
honour
from
the
person
to
the
deeds
of
love
and
sacrifice
for
the
benefit
of
one
neighbour
are
generally
honoured
wherever
they
are
manifested
thereby
we
multiply
the
valuation
of
things
which
are
thus
loved
or
for
which
we
sacrifice
ourselves
although
perhaps
they
are
not
worth
much
in
themselves
a
brave
army
is
convinced
of
the
cause
for
which
it
fights
ambition
a
substitute
for
the
moral
the
moral
sense
must
not
be
lacking
in
those
natures
which
have
no
ambition
the
ambitious
manage
without
it
with
almost
the
same
results
for
this
reason
the
sons
of
unpretentious
unambitious
families
when
once
they
lose
the
moral
sense
generally
degenerate
very
quickly
into
complete
scamps
vanity
how
poor
would
be
the
human
mind
without
vanity
thus
however
it
resembles
a
and
constantly
replenished
bazaar
which
attracts
buyers
of
every
kind
there
they
can
find
almost
everything
obtain
almost
everything
provided
that
they
bring
the
right
sort
of
coin
namely
admiration
old
age
and
apart
from
the
commands
of
religion
the
question
may
well
be
asked
why
is
it
more
worthy
for
an
old
man
who
feels
his
powers
decline
to
await
his
slow
exhaustion
and
extinction
than
with
full
consciousness
to
set
a
limit
to
his
life
suicide
in
this
case
is
a
perfectly
natural
obvious
action
which
should
justly
arouse
respect
as
a
triumph
of
reason
and
did
arouse
it
in
those
times
when
the
heads
of
greek
philosophy
and
the
sturdiest
patriots
used
to
seek
death
through
suicide
the
seeking
on
the
contrary
to
prolong
existence
from
day
to
day
with
anxious
consultation
of
doctors
and
painful
mode
of
living
without
the
power
of
drawing
nearer
to
the
actual
aim
of
life
is
far
less
worthy
religion
is
rich
in
excuses
to
reply
to
the
demand
for
suicide
and
thus
it
ingratiates
itself
with
those
who
wish
to
cling
to
life
errors
of
the
sufferer
and
the
when
a
rich
man
deprives
a
poor
man
of
a
possession
for
instance
a
prince
taking
the
sweetheart
of
a
plebeian
an
error
arises
in
the
mind
of
the
poor
man
he
thinks
that
the
rich
man
must
be
utterly
infamous
to
take
away
from
him
the
little
that
he
has
but
the
rich
man
does
not
estimate
so
highly
the
value
of
a
possession
because
he
is
accustomed
to
have
many
hence
he
can
not
imagine
himself
in
the
poor
man
place
and
does
not
commit
nearly
so
great
a
wrong
as
the
latter
supposes
they
each
have
a
mistaken
idea
of
the
other
the
injustice
of
the
powerful
which
more
than
anything
else
rouses
indignation
in
history
is
by
no
means
so
great
as
it
appears
alone
the
mere
inherited
consciousness
of
being
a
higher
creation
with
higher
claims
produces
a
cold
temperament
and
leaves
the
conscience
quiet
we
all
of
us
feel
no
injustice
when
the
difference
is
very
great
between
ourselves
and
another
creature
and
kill
a
fly
for
instance
without
any
pricks
of
conscience
therefore
it
was
no
sign
of
badness
in
xerxes
whom
even
all
greeks
describe
as
superlatively
noble
when
he
took
a
son
away
from
his
father
and
had
him
cut
in
pieces
because
he
had
expressed
a
nervous
ominous
distrust
of
the
whole
campaign
in
this
case
the
individual
is
put
out
of
the
way
like
an
unpleasant
insect
he
is
too
lowly
to
be
allowed
any
longer
to
cause
annoyance
to
a
ruler
of
the
world
yes
every
cruel
man
is
not
so
cruel
as
the
one
imagines
the
idea
of
pain
is
not
the
same
as
its
endurance
it
is
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
unjust
judges
of
the
journalist
who
leads
public
opinion
astray
by
small
dishonesties
in
all
these
cases
cause
and
effect
are
surrounded
by
entirely
different
groups
of
feelings
and
thoughts
yet
one
unconsciously
takes
it
for
granted
that
doer
and
sufferer
think
and
feel
alike
and
according
to
this
supposition
we
measure
the
guilt
of
the
one
by
the
pain
of
the
other

are
enclosed

which
makes
the

the

the
soul
are
enwrapped
with

it
is
the
skin

apart
from

can
we
speak
of

in
this
case
the
man
wishes
to

but
at
the
expense
of
his
either
by
misleading
them
into
holding
a
false
opinion
about

or
by
aiming
at
a
degree
of
good
opinion
which
must
be
painful
to
every

by
arousing

the
individual
usually
wishes
to
corroborate
the
opinion
he
holds
of
himself
by
the
opinion
of
others
and
to
strengthen
it
in
his
own
eyes
but
the
strong
habit
of
authority
a
habit
as
old
as
man
himself
induces
many
to
support
by
authority
their
belief
in
themselves
that
is
to
say
they
accept
it
first
from
others
they
trust
the
judgment
of
others
more
than
their
own
the
interest
in
himself
the
wish
to
please
himself
attains
to
such
a
height
in
a
vain
man
that
he
misleads
others
into
having
a
false
all
too
elevated
estimation
of
him
and
yet
nevertheless
sets
store
by
their
authority
thus
causing
an
error
and
yet
believing
in
it
it
must
be
confessed
therefore
that
vain
people
do
not
wish
to
please
others
so
much
as
themselves
and
that
they
go
so
far
therein
as
to
neglect
their
advantage
for
they
often
endeavour
to
prejudice
their

injuriously
against

in

proves
himself
to
be
otherwise
what
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
morality
gives
only
think
what
a
sea
of
pleasant
tears
has
been
shed
over
descriptions
of
noble
and
unselfish
deeds
this
charm
of
life
would
vanish
if
the
belief
in
absolute
irresponsibility
were
to
obtain
supremacy
the
origin
of
justice
equity
has
its
origin
amongst
powers
which
are
fairly
equal
as
thucydides
in
the
terrible
dialogue
between
the
athenian
and
melian
ambassadors
rightly
comprehended
that
is
to
say
where
there
is
no
clearly
recognisable
supremacy
and
where
a
conflict
would
be
useless
and
would
injure
both
sides
there
arises
the
thought
of
coming
to
an
understanding
and
settling
the
opposing
claims
the
character
of
is
the
primary
character
of
justice
each
party
satisfies
the
other
as
each
obtains
what
he
values
more
than
the
other
each
one
receives
that
which
he
desires
as
his
own
henceforth
and
whatever
is
desired
is
received
in
return
justice
therefore
is
recompense
and
exchange
based
on
the
hypothesis
of
a
fairly
equal
degree
of
power
thus
originally
revenge
belongs
to
the
province
of
justice
it
is
an
exchange
also
justice
naturally
is
based
on
the
point
of
view
of
a
judicious
on
the
egoism
therefore
of
that
reflection
why
should
i
injure
myself
uselessly
and
perhaps
not
attain
my
aim
after
all
so
much
about
the
of
justice
because
man
according
to
his
intellectual
custom
has
the
original
purpose
of
just
and
reasonable
actions
and
particularly
because
for
hundreds
of
years
children
have
been
taught
to
admire
and
imitate
such
actions
the
idea
has
gradually
arisen
that
such
an
action
is
upon
this
idea
however
is
based
the
high
estimation
in
which
it
is
held
which
moreover
like
all
valuations
is
constantly
growing
for
something
that
is
valued
highly
is
striven
after
imitated
multiplied
and
increases
because
the
value
of
the
output
of
toil
and
enthusiasm
of
each
individual
is
added
to
the
value
of
the
thing
itself
how
little
moral
would
the
world
look
without
this
forgetfulness
a
poet
might
say
that
god
had
placed
forgetfulness
as
in
the
temple
of
human
dignity
the
right
of
the
when
any
one
submits
under
certain
conditions
to
a
greater
power
as
a
besieged
town
for
instance
the
is
that
one
can
destroy
one
self
burn
the
town
and
so
cause
the
mighty
one
a
great
loss
therefore
there
is
a
kind
of
here
on
the
basis
of
which
rights
may
be
determined
the
enemy
has
his
advantage
in
maintaining
it
in
so
far
there
are
also
rights
between
slaves
and
masters
that
is
precisely
so
far
as
the
possession
of
the
slave
is
useful
and
important
to
his
master
the
originally
extends
far
one
to
be
valuable
to
the
other
essentially
unlosable
unconquerable
and
so
forth
in
so
far
the
weaker
one
also
has
rights
but
lesser
ones
hence
the
famous
tantum
juris
habet
quantum
potentia
or
more
exactly
potentia
valere
the
three
phases
of
hitherto
existing
it
is
the
first
sign
that
the
animal
has
become
man
when
its
actions
no
longer
have
regard
only
to
momentary
welfare
but
to
what
is
enduring
when
it
grows
and
there
the
free
rule
of
reason
first
breaks
out
a
still
higher
step
is
reached
when
he
acts
according
to
the
principle
of
by
this
means
he
brings
himself
into
order
submits
to
common
feelings
and
that
exalts
him
still
higher
over
the
phase
in
which
he
was
led
only
by
the
idea
of
usefulness
from
a
personal
point
of
view
he
respects
and
wishes
to
be
respected
he
understands
usefulness
as
dependent
upon
what
he
thinks
of
others
and
what
others
think
of
him
eventually
he
acts
on
the
highest
step
of
the
existing
morality
according
to
standard
of
things
and
men
he
himself
decides
for
himself
and
others
what
is
honourable
what
is
useful
he
has
become
the
of
opinions
in
accordance
with
the
ever
more
highly
developed
idea
of
what
is
useful
and
honourable
knowledge
enables
him
to
place
that
which
is
most
useful
that
is
to
say
the
general
enduring
usefulness
above
the
personal
the
honourable
recognition
of
general
enduring
validity
above
the
momentary
he
lives
and
acts
as
a
collective
individual
the
morality
of
the
mature
the
impersonal
has
hitherto
been
looked
upon
as
the
actual
distinguishing
mark
of
moral
action
and
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
in
the
beginning
it
was
in
consideration
of
the
common
good
that
all
impersonal
actions
were
praised
and
distinguished
is
not
an
important
change
in
these
views
impending
now
when
it
is
more
and
more
recognised
that
it
is
precisely
in
the
possible
considerations
that
the
common
good
is
the
greatest
so
that
a
action
now
best
illustrates
the
present
idea
of
morality
as
utility
for
the
mass
to
make
a
whole
out
of
ourselves
and
in
all
that
we
do
to
keep
that
personality
in
view
carries
us
further
than
those
sympathetic
emotions
and
actions
for
the
benefit
of
others
we
all
still
suffer
certainly
from
the
too
small
consideration
of
the
personal
in
us
it
is
badly
developed
let
us
admit
it
rather
has
our
mind
been
forcibly
drawn
away
from
it
and
offered
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
state
to
science
or
to
those
who
stand
in
need
of
help
as
if
it
were
the
bad
part
which
must
be
sacrificed
we
are
still
willing
to
work
for
our
but
only
so
far
as
we
find
our
own
greatest
advantage
in
this
work
no
more
and
no
less
it
is
only
a
question
of
what
we
understand
as
advantage
the
unripe
undeveloped
crude
individual
will
understand
it
in
the
crudest
way
custom
and
to
be
moral
correct
and
virtuous
is
to
be
obedient
to
an
law
and
custom
whether
we
submit
with
difficulty
or
willingly
is
immaterial
enough
that
we
do
so
he
is
called
good
who
as
if
naturally
after
long
precedent
easily
and
willingly
therefore
does
what
is
right
according
to
whatever
this
may
be
as
for
instance
taking
revenge
if
to
take
revenge
be
considered
as
right
as
amongst
the
ancient
greeks
he
is
called
good
because
he
is
good
for
something
but
as
goodwill
pity
consideration
moderation
and
such
like
have
come
with
the
change
in
manners
to
be
looked
upon
as
good
for
something
as
useful
the
and
helpful
have
later
on
come
to
be
distinguished
specially
as
good
in
the
beginning
other
and
more
important
kinds
of
usefulness
stood
in
the
foreground
to
be
evil
is
to
be
not
moral
immoral
to
be
immoral
is
to
be
in
opposition
to
tradition
however
sensible
or
stupid
it
may
be
injury
to
the
community
the
neighbour
being
understood
thereby
has
however
been
looked
upon
by
the
social
laws
of
all
different
ages
as
being
eminently
the
actual
immorality
so
that
now
at
the
word
evil
we
immediately
think
of
voluntary
injury
to
one
neighbour
the
fundamental
antithesis
which
has
taught
man
the
distinction
between
moral
and
immoral
between
good
and
evil
is
not
the
egoistic
and
but
the
being
bound
to
the
tradition
law
and
solution
thereof
how
the
tradition
has
is
immaterial
at
all
events
without
regard
to
good
and
evil
or
any
immanent
categorical
imperative
but
above
all
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
a
a
generation
an
association
a
people
every
superstitious
custom
that
has
arisen
on
account
of
some
falsely
explained
accident
creates
a
tradition
which
it
is
moral
to
follow
to
separate
one
self
from
it
is
dangerous
but
more
dangerous
for
the
than
for
the
individual
because
the
godhead
punishes
the
community
for
every
outrage
and
every
violation
of
its
rights
and
the
individual
only
in
proportion
now
every
tradition
grows
continually
more
venerable
the
farther
off
lies
its
origin
the
more
this
is
lost
sight
of
the
veneration
paid
it
accumulates
from
generation
to
generation
the
tradition
at
last
becomes
holy
and
excites
awe
and
thus
in
any
case
the
morality
of
piety
is
a
much
older
morality
than
that
which
requires
actions
pleasure
in
traditional
an
important
species
of
pleasure
and
therewith
the
source
of
morality
arises
out
of
habit
man
does
what
is
habitual
to
him
more
easily
better
and
therefore
more
willingly
he
feels
a
pleasure
therein
and
knows
from
experience
that
the
habitual
has
been
tested
and
is
therefore
useful
a
custom
that
we
can
live
with
is
proved
to
be
wholesome
and
advantageous
in
contrast
to
all
new
and
not
yet
tested
experiments
according
to
this
morality
is
the
union
of
the
pleasant
and
the
useful
moreover
it
requires
no
reflection
as
soon
as
man
can
use
compulsion
he
uses
it
to
introduce
and
enforce
his
for
in
his
eyes
they
are
proved
as
the
wisdom
of
life
in
the
same
way
a
company
of
individuals
compels
each
single
one
to
adopt
the
same
customs
here
the
inference
is
wrong
because
we
feel
at
ease
with
a
morality
or
at
least
because
we
are
able
to
carry
on
existence
with
it
therefore
this
morality
is
necessary
for
it
seems
to
be
the
possibility
of
feeling
at
ease
the
ease
of
life
seems
to
grow
out
of
it
alone
this
comprehension
of
the
habitual
as
a
necessity
of
existence
is
pursued
even
to
the
smallest
details
of
custom
as
insight
into
genuine
causality
is
very
small
with
lower
peoples
and
civilisations
they
take
precautions
with
superstitious
fear
that
everything
should
go
in
its
same
groove
even
where
custom
is
difficult
hard
and
burdensome
it
is
preserved
on
account
of
its
apparent
highest
usefulness
it
is
not
known
that
the
same
degree
of
can
also
exist
with
other
customs
and
that
even
higher
degrees
may
be
attained
we
become
aware
however
that
all
customs
even
the
hardest
grow
pleasanter
and
milder
with
time
and
that
the
severest
way
of
life
may
become
a
habit
and
therefore
a
pleasure
pleasure
and
social
out
of
his
relations
with
other
men
man
obtains
a
new
species
of
in
addition
to
those
pleasurable
sensations
which
he
derives
from
himself
whereby
he
greatly
increases
the
scope
of
enjoyment
perhaps
he
has
already
taken
too
many
of
the
pleasures
of
this
sphere
from
animals
which
visibly
feel
pleasure
when
they
play
with
each
other
especially
the
mother
with
her
young
then
consider
the
sexual
relations
which
make
almost
every
female
interesting
to
a
male
with
regard
to
pleasure
and
the
feeling
of
pleasure
on
the
basis
of
human
relations
generally
makes
man
better
joy
in
common
pleasure
enjoyed
together
is
increased
it
gives
the
individual
security
makes
him
and
dispels
mistrust
and
envy
for
we
feel
ourselves
at
ease
and
see
others
at
ease
manifestations
of
awaken
the
idea
of
the
same
sensations
the
feeling
of
being
like
something
a
like
effect
is
produced
by
common
sufferings
the
same
bad
weather
dangers
enemies
upon
this
foundation
is
based
the
oldest
alliance
the
object
of
which
is
the
mutual
obviating
and
averting
of
a
threatening
danger
for
the
benefit
of
each
individual
and
thus
the
social
instinct
grows
out
of
pleasure
the
innocent
side
of
evil
all
evil
actions
are
prompted
by
the
instinct
of
preservation
or
more
exactly
by
the
desire
for
pleasure
and
the
avoidance
of
pain
on
the
part
of
the
individual
thus
prompted
but
not
evil
to
cause
pain
does
not
exist
except
in
the
brains
of
philosophers
neither
does
to
give
pleasure
pity
in
schopenhauer
meaning
in
the
social
condition
the
state
we
kill
the
creature
be
it
ape
or
man
who
tries
to
take
from
us
the
fruit
of
a
tree
when
we
are
hungry
and
approach
the
tree
as
we
should
still
do
with
animals
in
inhospitable
countries
the
evil
actions
which
now
most
rouse
our
indignation
are
based
upon
the
error
that
he
who
causes
them
has
a
free
will
that
he
had
the
option
therefore
of
not
doing
us
this
injury
this
belief
in
option
arouses
hatred
desire
for
revenge
spite
and
the
deterioration
of
the
whole
imagination
while
we
are
much
less
angry
with
an
animal
because
we
consider
it
irresponsible
to
do
injury
not
from
the
instinct
of
preservation
but
as
is
the
consequence
of
a
false
judgment
and
therefore
equally
innocent
the
individual
can
in
the
condition
which
lies
before
the
state
act
sternly
and
cruelly
towards
other
creatures
for
the
purpose
of
to
establish
his
existence
firmly
by
such
terrifying
proofs
of
his
power
thus
act
the
violent
the
mighty
the
original
founders
of
states
who
subdue
the
weaker
to
themselves
they
have
the
right
to
do
so
such
as
the
state
still
takes
for
itself
or
rather
there
is
no
right
that
can
hinder
this
the
ground
for
can
only
be
made
ready
when
a
stronger
individual
or
a
collective
individual
for
instance
society
or
the
state
subdues
the
single
individuals
them
out
of
their
singleness
and
forms
them
into
an
precedes
morality
indeed
morality
itself
is
compulsion
for
a
time
to
which
one
submits
for
the
avoidance
of
pain
later
on
it
becomes
custom
later
still
free
obedience
and
finally
almost
instinct
then
like
everything
long
accustomed
and
natural
it
is
connected
with
pleasure
and
is
henceforth
called
shame
exists
everywhere
where
there
is
a
mystery
this
however
is
a
religious
idea
which
was
widely
extended
in
the
older
times
of
human
civilisation
everywhere
were
found
bounded
domains
to
which
access
was
forbidden
by
divine
right
except
under
certain
conditions
at
first
locally
as
for
example
certain
spots
that
ought
not
to
be
trodden
by
the
feet
of
the
uninitiated
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
these
latter
experienced
horror
and
fear
this
feeling
was
a
good
deal
carried
over
into
other
relations
for
instance
the
sex
relations
which
as
a
privilege
and
of
riper
years
had
to
be
withheld
from
the
knowledge
of
the
young
for
their
advantage
relations
for
the
protection
and
sanctification
of
which
many
gods
were
invented
and
were
set
up
as
guardians
in
the
nuptial
chamber
in
turkish
this
room
is
on
this
account
called
harem
sanctuary
and
is
distinguished
with
the
same
name
therefore
that
is
used
for
the
entrance
courts
of
the
mosques
thus
the
kingdom
is
as
a
centre
from
which
radiate
power
and
glory
to
the
subjects
a
mystery
full
of
secrecy
and
shame
of
which
many
may
still
be
felt
among
nations
which
otherwise
do
not
by
any
means
belong
to
the
bashful
type
similarly
the
whole
world
of
inner
conditions
the
soul
is
still
a
mystery
for
all
who
are
not
philosophers
after
it
has
been
looked
upon
for
endless
ages
as
of
divine
origin
and
as
worthy
of
divine
intercourse
according
to
this
it
is
an
and
arouses
shame
judge
in
considering
earlier
periods
care
must
be
taken
not
to
fall
into
unjust
abuse
the
injustice
in
slavery
the
cruelty
in
the
suppression
of
persons
and
nations
is
not
to
be
measured
by
our
standard
for
the
instinct
of
justice
was
not
then
so
far
developed
who
dares
to
reproach
the
genevese
calvin
with
the
burning
of
the
physician
servet
it
was
an
action
following
and
resulting
from
his
convictions
and
in
the
same
way
the
inquisition
had
a
good
right
only
the
ruling
views
were
false
and
produced
a
result
which
seems
hard
to
us
because
those
views
have
now
grown
strange
to
us
besides
what
is
the
burning
of
a
single
individual
compared
with
eternal
pains
of
hell
for
almost
all
and
yet
this
idea
was
universal
at
that
time
without
essentially
injuring
by
its
dreadfulness
the
conception
of
a
god
with
us
too
political
sectarians
are
hardly
and
cruelly
treated
but
because
one
is
accustomed
to
believe
in
the
necessity
of
the
state
the
cruelty
is
not
so
deeply
felt
here
as
it
is
where
we
repudiate
the
views
cruelty
to
animals
in
children
and
italians
is
due
to
ignorance
the
animal
through
the
interests
of
church
teaching
has
been
placed
too
far
behind
man
much
that
is
dreadful
and
inhuman
in
history
much
that
one
hardly
likes
to
believe
is
mitigated
by
the
reflection
that
the
one
who
commands
and
the
one
who
carries
out
are
different
persons
the
former
does
not
behold
the
right
and
therefore
does
not
experience
the
strong
impression
on
the
imagination
the
latter
obeys
a
superior
and
therefore
feels
no
responsibility
most
princes
and
military
heads
through
lack
of
imagination
easily
appear
hard
and
cruel
without
really
being
so
is
not
evil
because
the
idea
of
the
neighbour
the
word
is
of
christian
origin
and
does
not
represent
the
truth
is
very
weak
in
us
and
we
feel
ourselves
almost
as
free
and
irresponsible
towards
him
as
towards
plants
and
stones
we
have
yet
to
that
others
suffer
and
this
can
never
be
completely
learnt
man
always
acts
rightly
we
do
not
complain
of
nature
as
immoral
because
it
sends
a
thunderstorm
and
makes
us
wet
why
do
we
call
those
who
injure
us
immoral
because
in
the
latter
case
we
take
for
granted
a
free
will
functioning
voluntarily
in
the
former
we
see
necessity
but
this
distinction
is
an
error
thus
we
do
not
call
even
intentional
injury
immoral
in
all
circumstances
for
instance
we
kill
a
fly
unhesitatingly
and
intentionally
only
because
its
buzzing
annoys
us
we
punish
a
criminal
intentionally
and
hurt
him
in
order
to
protect
ourselves
and
society
in
the
first
case
it
is
the
individual
who
in
order
to
preserve
himself
or
even
to
protect
himself
from
worry
does
intentional
injury
in
the
second
case
it
is
the
state
all
morals
allow
intentional
injury
the
case
of
necessity
that
is
when
it
is
a
matter
of
but
these
two
points
of
view
suffice
to
explain
all
evil
actions
committed
by
men
against
men
we
are
desirous
of
obtaining
pleasure
or
avoiding
pain
in
any
case
it
is
always
a
question
of
socrates
and
plato
are
right
whatever
man
does
he
always
does
well
that
is
he
does
that
which
seems
to
him
good
useful
according
to
the
degree
of
his
intellect
the
particular
standard
of
his
reasonableness
the
harmlessness
of
the
aim
of
malice
is
the
suffering
of
others
in
itself
but
our
own
enjoyment
for
instance
as
the
feeling
of
revenge
or
stronger
nervous
excitement
all
teasing
even
shows
the
pleasure
it
gives
to
exercise
our
power
on
others
and
bring
it
to
an
enjoyable
feeling
of
preponderance
is
it
to
taste
pleasure
at
the
expense
of
another
pain
is
malicious
joy
devilish
as
schopenhauer
says
we
give
ourselves
pleasure
in
nature
by
breaking
off
twigs
loosening
stones
fighting
with
wild
animals
and
do
this
in
order
to
become
thereby
conscious
of
our
strength
is
the
knowledge
therefore
that
another
suffers
through
us
the
same
thing
concerning
which
we
otherwise
feel
irresponsible
supposed
to
make
us
immoral
but
if
we
did
not
know
this
we
would
not
thereby
have
the
enjoyment
of
our
own
superiority
which
can
only
itself
by
the
suffering
of
others
for
instance
in
teasing
all
pleasure
is
neither
good
nor
evil
whence
should
come
the
decision
that
in
order
to
have
pleasure
ourselves
we
may
not
cause
displeasure
to
others
from
the
point
of
view
of
usefulness
alone
that
is
out
of
consideration
for
the
for
displeasure
when
the
injured
one
or
the
replacing
state
gives
the
expectation
of
resentment
and
revenge
this
only
can
have
been
the
original
reason
for
denying
ourselves
such
actions
aims
just
as
little
at
the
pleasure
of
others
as
malice
at
the
pain
of
others
for
it
contains
at
least
two
perhaps
many
more
elements
of
a
personal
pleasure
and
is
so
far
in
the
first
place
as
the
pleasure
of
emotion
which
is
the
kind
of
pity
that
exists
in
tragedy
and
then
when
it
impels
to
action
as
the
pleasure
of
satisfaction
in
the
exercise
of
power
if
besides
this
a
suffering
person
is
very
dear
to
us
we
lift
a
sorrow
from
ourselves
by
the
exercise
of
sympathetic
actions
except
by
a
few
philosophers
pity
has
always
been
placed
very
low
in
the
scale
of
moral
feelings
and
rightly
so
if
is
allowed
to
pass
as
moral
then
almost
all
manifestations
of
the
immoral
egoism
must
also
stand
men
injure
rob
or
kill
in
order
to
preserve
or
defend
themselves
to
prevent
personal
injury
they
lie
where
cunning
and
dissimulation
are
the
right
means
of
injury
when
our
existence
or
safety
preservation
of
our
comfort
is
concerned
is
conceded
to
be
moral
the
state
itself
injures
according
to
this
point
of
view
when
it
punishes
in
unintentional
injury
of
course
there
can
be
nothing
immoral
that
is
ruled
by
chance
is
there
then
a
kind
of
intentional
injury
where
our
existence
or
the
preservation
of
our
comfort
is
concerned
is
there
an
injuring
out
of
pure
for
instance
in
cruelty
if
one
does
not
know
how
much
an
action
hurts
it
is
no
deed
of
malice
thus
the
child
is
not
malicious
towards
the
animal
not
evil
he
examines
and
destroys
it
like
a
toy
but
we
ever
know
entirely
how
an
action
hurts
another
as
far
as
our
nervous
system
extends
we
protect
ourselves
from
pain
if
it
extended
farther
to
our
namely
we
should
do
no
one
an
injury
except
in
such
cases
as
we
injure
ourselves
where
we
cut
ourselves
for
the
sake
of
cure
tire
and
exert
ourselves
for
the
sake
of
health
we
by
analogy
that
something
hurts
somebody
and
through
memory
and
the
strength
of
imagination
we
may
suffer
from
it
ourselves
but
still
what
a
difference
there
is
between
toothache
and
the
pain
pity
that
the
sight
of
toothache
calls
forth
therefore
in
injury
out
of
malice
the
of
pain
produced
is
always
unknown
to
us
but
inasmuch
as
there
is
in
the
action
the
feeling
of
one
own
power
one
own
strong
excitement
the
action
is
committed
in
order
to
preserve
the
comfort
of
the
individual
and
is
regarded
therefore
from
a
similar
point
of
view
as
defence
and
falsehood
in
necessity
no
life
without
pleasure
the
struggle
for
pleasure
is
the
struggle
for
life
whether
the
individual
so
fights
this
fight
that
men
call
him
good
or
so
that
they
call
him
evil
is
determined
by
the
measure
and
the
constitution
of
his
recompensing
whoever
has
completely
comprehended
the
doctrine
of
absolute
irresponsibility
can
no
longer
include
the
punishing
and
recompensing
justice
in
the
idea
of
justice
should
this
consist
of
giving
to
each
man
his
due
for
he
who
is
punished
does
not
deserve
the
punishment
he
is
only
used
as
a
means
of
henceforth
warning
away
from
certain
actions
equally
so
he
who
is
rewarded
does
not
merit
this
reward
he
could
not
act
otherwise
than
he
did
therefore
the
reward
is
meant
only
as
an
encouragement
to
him
and
others
to
provide
a
motive
for
subsequent
actions
words
of
praise
are
flung
to
the
runners
on
the
course
not
to
the
one
who
has
reached
the
goal
neither
punishment
nor
reward
is
anything
that
comes
to
one
as
own
they
are
given
from
motives
of
usefulness
without
one
having
a
right
to
claim
them
hence
we
must
say
the
wise
man
gives
no
reward
because
the
deed
has
been
well
done
just
as
we
have
said
the
wise
man
does
not
punish
because
evil
has
been
committed
but
in
order
that
evil
shall
not
be
committed
if
punishment
and
reward
no
longer
existed
then
the
strongest
motives
which
deter
men
from
certain
actions
and
impel
them
to
certain
other
actions
would
also
no
longer
exist
the
needs
of
mankind
require
their
continuance
and
inasmuch
as
punishment
and
reward
blame
and
praise
work
most
sensibly
on
vanity
the
same
need
requires
the
continuance
of
vanity
at
the
in
looking
at
a
we
imagine
that
there
is
freedom
of
will
and
fancy
in
the
countless
turnings
twistings
and
breakings
of
the
waves
but
everything
is
compulsory
every
movement
can
be
mathematically
calculated
so
it
is
also
with
human
actions
one
would
have
to
be
able
to
calculate
every
single
action
beforehand
if
one
were
equally
so
all
progress
of
knowledge
every
error
all
malice
the
one
who
acts
certainly
labours
under
the
illusion
of
voluntariness
if
the
world
wheel
were
to
stand
still
for
a
moment
and
an
calculating
reason
were
there
to
make
use
of
this
pause
it
could
foretell
the
future
of
every
creature
to
the
remotest
times
and
mark
out
every
track
upon
which
that
wheel
would
continue
to
roll
the
delusion
of
the
acting
agent
about
himself
the
supposition
of
a
free
will
belongs
to
this
mechanism
which
still
remains
to
be
calculated
irresponsibility
and
the
complete
irresponsibility
of
man
for
his
actions
and
his
nature
is
the
bitterest
drop
which
he
who
understands
must
swallow
if
he
was
accustomed
to
see
the
patent
of
nobility
of
his
humanity
in
responsibility
and
duty
all
his
valuations
distinctions
disinclinations
are
thereby
deprived
of
value
and
become
false
his
deepest
feeling
for
the
sufferer
and
the
hero
was
based
on
an
error
he
may
no
longer
either
praise
or
blame
for
it
is
absurd
to
praise
and
blame
nature
and
necessity
in
the
same
way
as
he
loves
a
fine
work
of
art
but
does
not
praise
it
because
it
can
do
nothing
for
itself
in
the
same
way
as
he
regards
plants
so
must
he
regard
his
own
actions
and
those
of
mankind
he
can
admire
strength
beauty
abundance
in
themselves
but
must
find
no
merit
therein
the
chemical
progress
and
the
strife
of
the
elements
the
torments
of
the
sick
person
who
thirsts
after
recovery
are
all
equally
as
little
merits
as
those
struggles
of
the
soul
and
states
of
distress
in
which
we
are
torn
hither
and
thither
by
different
impulses
until
we
finally
decide
for
the
strongest
as
we
say
but
in
reality
it
is
the
strongest
motive
which
decides
for
us
all
these
motives
however
whatever
fine
names
we
may
give
them
have
all
grown
out
of
the
same
root
in
which
we
believe
the
evil
poisons
to
be
situated
between
good
and
evil
actions
there
is
no
difference
of
species
but
at
most
of
degree
good
actions
are
sublimated
evil
ones
evil
actions
are
vulgarised
and
stupefied
good
ones
the
single
longing
of
the
individual
for
together
with
the
fear
of
losing
it
satisfies
itself
in
all
circumstances
man
may
act
as
he
can
that
is
as
he
must
be
it
in
deeds
of
vanity
revenge
pleasure
usefulness
malice
cunning
be
it
in
deeds
of
sacrifice
of
pity
of
knowledge
the
degrees
of
the
power
of
judgment
determine
whither
any
one
lets
himself
be
drawn
through
this
longing
to
every
society
to
every
individual
a
scale
of
possessions
is
continually
present
according
to
which
he
determines
his
actions
and
judges
those
of
others
but
this
standard
changes
constantly
many
actions
are
called
evil
and
are
only
stupid
because
the
degree
of
intelligence
which
decided
for
them
was
very
low
in
a
certain
sense
even
actions
are
still
stupid
for
the
highest
degree
of
human
intelligence
which
can
now
be
attained
will
assuredly
be
yet
surpassed
and
then
in
a
retrospect
all
our
actions
and
judgments
will
appear
as
limited
and
hasty
as
the
actions
and
judgments
of
primitive
wild
peoples
now
appear
limited
and
hasty
to
us
to
recognise
all
this
may
be
deeply
painful
but
consolation
comes
after
such
pains
are
the
pangs
of
birth
the
butterfly
wants
to
break
through
its
chrysalis
it
rends
and
tears
it
and
is
then
blinded
and
confused
by
the
unaccustomed
light
the
kingdom
of
liberty
in
such
people
as
are
of
such
sadness
and
how
few
are
the
first
experiment
made
is
to
see
whether
can
change
from
a
into
a
mankind
the
sun
of
a
new
gospel
throws
its
rays
upon
the
highest
point
in
the
soul
of
each
single
individual
then
the
mists
gather
thicker
than
ever
and
the
brightest
light
and
the
dreariest
shadow
lie
side
by
side
everything
is
necessity
so
says
the
new
knowledge
and
this
knowledge
itself
is
necessity
everything
is
innocence
and
knowledge
is
the
road
to
insight
into
this
innocence
are
pleasure
egoism
vanity
for
the
production
of
the
moral
phenomena
and
their
highest
result
the
sense
for
truth
and
justice
in
knowledge
were
error
and
the
confusion
of
the
imagination
the
only
means
through
which
mankind
could
raise
itself
gradually
to
this
degree
of
and
who
would
dare
to
undervalue
these
means
who
would
dare
to
be
sad
if
he
perceived
the
goal
to
which
those
roads
led
everything
in
the
domain
of
morality
has
evolved
is
changeable
unstable
everything
is
dissolved
it
is
true
but
is
also
streaming
towards
one
even
if
the
inherited
habit
of
erroneous
valuation
love
and
hatred
continue
to
reign
in
us
yet
under
the
influence
of
growing
knowledge
it
will
become
weaker
a
new
habit
that
of
comprehension
of
not
loving
not
hating
of
overlooking
is
gradually
implanting
itself
in
us
upon
the
same
ground
and
in
thousands
of
years
will
perhaps
be
powerful
enough
to
give
humanity
the
strength
to
produce
wise
innocent
consciously
innocent
men
as
it
now
produces
unwise
men
is
the
necessary
preliminary
step
not

this
is
the
untranslatable
word
which
means
joy
at
the
misfortune
of
third
division
the
religious
life
the
double
fight
against
when
misfortune
overtakes
us
we
can
either
pass
over
i
it
so
lightly
that
its
cause
is
removed
or
so
that
the
result
which
it
has
on
our
temperament
is
altered
through
a
changing
therefore
of
the
evil
into
a
good
the
utility
of
which
is
perhaps
not
visible
until
later
on
religion
and
art
also
metaphysical
philosophy
work
upon
the
changing
of
the
temperament
partly
through
the
changing
of
our
judgment
on
events
for
instance
with
the
help
of
the
phrase
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
partly
through
the
awakening
of
a
pleasure
in
pain
in
emotion
generally
whence
the
tragic
art
takes
its
the
more
a
man
is
inclined
to
twist
and
arrange
meanings
the
less
he
will
grasp
the
causes
of
evil
and
disperse
them
the
momentary
mitigation
and
influence
of
a
narcotic
as
for
example
in
toothache
suffices
him
even
in
more
serious
sufferings
the
more
the
dominion
of
creeds
and
all
arts
dispense
with
narcotics
the
more
strictly
men
attend
to
the
actual
removing
of
the
evil
which
is
certainly
bad
for
writers
of
tragedy
for
the
material
for
tragedy
is
growing
scarcer
because
the
domain
of
pitiless
inexorable
fate
is
growing
ever
narrower
but
worse
still
for
the
priests
for
they
have
hitherto
lived
on
the
narcotisation
of
human
woes
sorrow
is
how
greatly
we
should
like
to
exchange
the
false
assertions
of
the
priests
that
there
is
a
god
who
desires
good
from
us
a
guardian
and
witness
of
every
action
every
moment
every
thought
who
loves
us
and
seeks
our
welfare
in
all
misfortune
how
greatly
we
would
like
to
exchange
these
ideas
for
truths
which
would
be
just
as
healing
pacifying
and
beneficial
as
those
errors
but
there
are
no
such
truths
at
most
philosophy
can
oppose
to
them
metaphysical
appearances
at
bottom
also
untruths
the
tragedy
consists
in
the
fact
that
we
can
not
those
dogmas
of
religion
and
metaphysics
if
we
have
strict
methods
of
truth
in
heart
and
brain
on
the
other
hand
mankind
has
through
development
become
so
delicate
irritable
and
suffering
that
it
has
need
of
the
highest
means
of
healing
and
consolation
whence
also
the
danger
arises
that
man
would
bleed
to
death
from
recognised
truth
or
more
correctly
from
discovered
error
byron
has
expressed
this
in
the
immortal
lines
sorrow
is
knowledge
they
who
know
the
most
must
mourn
the
deepest
the
fatal
truth
the
tree
of
knowledge
is
not
that
of
life
for
such
troubles
there
is
no
better
help
than
to
recall
the
stately
levity
of
horace
at
least
for
the
worst
hours
and
eclipses
of
the
soul
and
to
say
with
him
quid
æternis
minorem
consiliis
animum
fatigas
cur
non
sub
alta
vel
platano
vel
hac
pinu
jacentes
but
assuredly
frivolity
or
melancholy
of
every
degree
is
better
than
a
romantic
retrospection
and
desertion
of
the
flag
an
approach
to
christianity
in
any
form
for
according
to
the
present
condition
of
knowledge
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
approach
it
without
hopelessly
soiling
our
and
giving
ourselves
away
to
ourselves
and
others
those
pains
may
be
unpleasant
enough
but
we
can
not
become
leaders
and
educators
of
mankind
without
pain
and
woe
to
him
who
would
wish
to
attempt
this
and
no
longer
have
that
clear
conscience
the
truth
in
in
the
period
of
rationalism
justice
was
not
done
to
the
importance
of
religion
of
that
there
is
no
doubt
but
equally
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
the
reaction
that
followed
this
rationalism
justice
was
far
overstepped
for
religions
were
treated
lovingly
even
amorously
and
for
instance
a
deeper
even
the
very
deepest
understanding
of
the
world
was
ascribed
to
them
which
science
has
only
to
strip
of
its
dogmatic
garment
in
order
to
possess
the
truth
in
unmythical
form
religions
should
therefore
this
was
the
opinion
of
all
opposers
of
rationalism
allegorico
with
all
consideration
for
the
understanding
of
the
masses
give
utterance
to
that
ancient
wisdom
which
is
wisdom
itself
inasmuch
as
all
true
science
of
later
times
has
always
led
up
to
it
instead
of
away
from
it
so
that
between
the
oldest
wisdom
of
mankind
and
all
later
harmonies
similarity
of
discernment
and
a
progress
of
knowledge
in
case
one
should
wish
to
speak
of
such
a
thing
rests
not
upon
the
nature
but
upon
the
way
of
communicating
it
this
whole
conception
of
religion
and
science
is
thoroughly
erroneous
and
none
would
still
dare
to
profess
it
if
schopenhauer
eloquence
had
not
taken
it
under
its
protection
this
resonant
eloquence
which
however
only
reached
its
hearers
a
generation
later
as
surely
as
from
schopenhauer
interpretations
of
men
and
the
world
much
may
be
gained
for
the
understanding
of
the
christian
and
other
religions
so
surely
also
is
he
mistaken
about
the
of
religion
for
therein
he
himself
was
only
a
too
docile
pupil
of
the
scientific
teachers
of
his
time
who
all
worshipped
romanticism
and
had
forsworn
the
spirit
of
enlightenment
had
he
been
born
in
our
present
age
he
could
not
possibly
have
talked
about
the
of
religion
he
would
much
rather
have
given
honour
to
truth
as
he
used
to
do
with
the
words
religion
direct
or
indirect
either
as
dogma
or
as
allegory
has
ever
contained
a
for
each
has
been
born
of
fear
and
necessity
through
the
byways
of
reason
did
it
slip
into
existence
once
perhaps
when
imperilled
by
science
some
philosophic
doctrine
has
lied
itself
into
its
system
in
order
that
it
may
be
found
there
later
but
this
is
a
theological
trick
of
the
time
when
a
religion
already
doubts
itself
these
tricks
of
theology
which
certainly
were
practised
in
the
early
days
of
christianity
as
the
religion
of
a
scholarly
period
steeped
in
philosophy
have
led
to
that
superstition
of
the
allegoricus
but
yet
more
the
habits
of
the
philosophers
especially
the
the
poetical
philosophers
and
the
philosophising
artists
to
treat
all
the
sensations
which
they
discovered
in
as
the
fundamental
nature
of
man
in
general
and
hence
to
allow
their
own
religious
feelings
an
important
influence
in
the
building
up
of
their
systems
as
philosophers
frequently
philosophised
under
the
custom
of
religious
habits
or
at
least
under
the
anciently
inherited
power
of
that
metaphysical
need
they
developed
doctrinal
opinions
which
really
bore
a
great
resemblance
to
the
jewish
or
christian
or
indian
religious
views
a
resemblance
namely
such
as
children
usually
bear
to
their
mothers
only
that
in
this
case
the
fathers
were
not
clear
about
that
motherhood
as
happens
sometimes
but
in
their
innocence
romanced
about
a
family
likeness
between
all
religion
and
science
in
reality
between
religions
and
real
science
there
exists
neither
relationship
nor
friendship
nor
even
enmity
they
live
on
different
planets
every
philosophy
which
shows
a
religious
comet
tail
shining
in
the
darkness
of
its
last
prospects
makes
all
the
science
it
contains
suspicious
all
this
is
presumably
also
religion
even
though
in
the
guise
of
science
moreover
if
all
nations
were
to
agree
about
certain
religious
matters
for
instance
the
existence
of
a
god
which
it
may
be
remarked
is
not
the
case
with
regard
to
this
point
this
would
only
be
an
argument
those
affirmed
matters
for
instance
the
existence
of
a
god
the
and
in
general
can
only
take
place
in
case
of
a
huge
folly
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
omnium
sapientium
with
regard
to
any
single
thing

applied
to

the
consists
in
this
that
the
counts
as
a
folly
the
origin
of
the
religious
if
we
go
back
to
the
times
in
which
the
religious
life
flourished
to
the
greatest
extent
we
find
a
fundamental
conviction
which
we
now
no
longer
share
and
whereby
the
doors
leading
to
a
religious
life
are
closed
to
us
once
for
all
it
concerns
nature
and
intercourse
with
her
in
those
times
people
knew
nothing
of
natural

neither
for

nor
for

is
there
a

a

the
sunshine
the
rain
may
come
or
may
not

in

every
idea
of
natural
causality
is
lacking
when
one
rows
it
is
not
the
rowing
that
moves
the
boat
but
rowing
is
only
a
magical
ceremony
by
which
one
compels
a
to
move
the
boat
all
maladies
even
death
itself
are
the
result
of
magical
influences
illness
and
death
never
happen
naturally
the
whole
conception
of
natural
sequence
is
lacking
it
dawned
first
amongst
the
older
greeks
that
is
in
a
very
late
phase
of
humanity
in
the
conception
of
enthroned
above
the
gods
when
a
man
shoots
with
a
bow
there
is
still
always
present
an
irrational
hand
and
strength
if
the
wells
suddenly
dry
up
men
think
first
of
subterranean
and
their
tricks
it
must
be
the
arrow
of
a

beneath
whose
invisible
blow
a
man
suddenly
sinks
down
in

says
lubbock
a
carpenter
is
accustomed
to
offer
sacrifice
to
his
hammer
his
hatchet
and
the
rest
of
his
tools
in
the
same
way
a
brahmin
treats
the
pen
with
which
he
writes
a
soldier
the
weapons
he
requires
in
the
field
of

a
mason
his

a

his
plough
in
the
imagination
of
religious
people
all
nature
is
a
summary
of
the
actions
of
conscious
and
voluntary
creatures
an
enormous
complex
of
no
conclusion
may
be
drawn
with
regard
to
everything
that
is
outside
of
us
that
anything
will
so
and
so
be
so
and
so
the
approximately
sure
reliable
are
man
is
the
nature
is
this
theory
contains
the
fundamental
conviction
which
obtains
in
rude
religiously
productive
primitive
civilisations
we
men
feel
just
the
contrary
the
richer
man
now
feels
himself
inwardly
the
more
polyphonous
is
the
music
and
the
noise
of
his
soul
the
more
powerfully
the
symmetry
of
nature
works
upon
him
we
all
recognise
with
goethe
the
great
means
in
nature
for
the
appeasing
of
the
modern
soul
we
listen
to
the
pendulum
swing
of
this
greatest
of
clocks
with
a
longing
for
rest
for
home
and
tranquillity
as
if
we
could
absorb
this
symmetry
into
ourselves
and
could
only
thereby
arrive
at
the
enjoyment
of
ourselves
formerly
it
was
otherwise
if
we
consider
the
rude
early
condition
of
nations
or
contemplate
savages
at
close
quarters
we
find
them
most
strongly
influenced
by
and
by
the
individual
is
almost
automatically
bound
to
them
and
moves
with
the
uniformity
of
a
pendulum
to
him
nature
uncomprehended
terrible
mysterious
nature
must
appear
as
the
of
liberty
of
voluntariness
of
the
higher
power
even
as
a
superhuman
degree
of
existence
as
god
in
those
times
and
conditions
however
every
individual
felt
that
his
existence
his
happiness
and
that
of
the
family
and
the
state
and
the
success
of
all
undertakings
depended
on
those
spontaneities
of
nature
certain
natural
events
must
appear
at
the
right
time
others
be
absent
at
the
right
time
how
can
one
have
any
influence
on
these
terrible
unknown
things
how
can
one
bind
the
sphere
of
liberty
thus
he
asks
himself
thus
he
inquires
anxiously
is
there
then
no
means
of
making
those
powers
as
regular
through
tradition
and
law
as
you
are
yourself
the
aim
of
those
who
believe
in
magic
and
miracles
is
to
a
law
on
nature
and
briefly
the
religious
cult
is
a
result
of
this
aim
the
problem
which
those
people
have
set
themselves
is
closely
related
to
this
how
can
the
race
dictate
laws
to
the
rule
it
and
guide
its
actions
in
relation
to
the
weaker
one
would
first
remember
the
most
harmless
sort
of
compulsion
that
compulsion
which
one
exercises
when
one
has
gained
any
one
affection
by
imploring
and
praying
by
submission
by
the
obligation
of
regular
taxes
and
gifts
by
flattering
glorifications
it
is
also
possible
to
exercise
an
influence
upon
the
powers
of
nature
inasmuch
as
one
gains
the
affections
love
binds
and
becomes
bound
then
one
can
make
compacts
by
which
one
is
mutually
bound
to
a
certain
behaviour
where
one
gives
pledges
and
exchanges
vows
but
far
more
important
is
a
species
of
more
forcible
compulsion
by
magic
and
witchcraft
as
with
the
sorcerer
help
man
is
able
to
injure
a
more
powerful
enemy
and
keep
him
in
fear
as
the
works
at
a
distance
so
the
weaker
man
believes
he
can
influence
the
mightier
spirits
of
nature
the
principal
thing
in
all
witchcraft
is
that
we
must
get
into
our
possession
something
that
belongs
to
some
one
hair
nails
food
from
their
table
even
their
portrait
their
name
with
such
apparatus
we
can
then
practise
sorcery
for
the
fundamental
rule
is
to
everything
spiritual
there
belongs
something
corporeal
with
the
help
of
this
we
are
able
to
bind
the
spirit
to
injure
it
and
destroy
it
the
corporeal
furnishes
the
handles
with
which
we
can
grasp
the
spiritual
as
man
controls
man
so
he
controls
some
natural
spirit
or
other
for
this
has
also
its
corporeal
part
by
which
it
may
be
grasped
the
tree
and
compared
with
it
the
seed
from
which
it
sprang
this
enigmatical
contrast
seems
to
prove
that
the
same
spirit
embodied
itself
in
both
forms
now
small
now
large
a
stone
that
begins
to
roll
suddenly
is
the
body
in
which
a
spirit
operates
if
there
is
an
enormous
rock
lying
on
a
lonely
heath
it
seems
impossible
to
conceive
human
strength
sufficient
to
have
brought
it
there
consequently
the
stone
must
have
moved
there
by
itself
that
is
it
must
be
possessed
by
a
spirit
everything
that
has
a
body
is
susceptible
to
witchcraft
therefore
also
the
natural
spirits
if
a
god
is
bound
to
his
image
we
can
use
the
most
direct
compulsion
against
him
through
refusal
of
sacrificial
food
scourging
binding
in
fetters
and
so
on
in
order
to
obtain
by
force
the
missing
favour
of
their
god
the
lower
classes
in
china
wind
cords
round
the
image
of
the
one
who
has
left
them
in
the
lurch
pull
it
down
and
drag
it
through
the
streets
in
the
dust
and
the
dirt
you
dog
of
a
spirit
they
say
we
gave
you
a
magnificent
temple
to
live
in
we
gilded
you
prettily
we
fed
you
well
we
offered
you
sacrifice
and
yet
you
are
so
ungrateful
similar
forcible
measures
against
pictures
of
the
saints
and
virgin
when
they
refused
to
do
their
duty
in
pestilence
or
drought
have
been
witnessed
even
during
the
present
century
in
catholic
countries
through
all
these
magic
relations
to
nature
countless
ceremonies
have
been
called
into
life
and
at
last
when
the
confusion
has
grown
too
great
an
endeavour
has
been
made
to
order
and
systematise
them
in
order
that
the
favourable
course
of
the
whole
progress
of
nature
of
the
great
succession
of
the
seasons
may
seem
to
be
guaranteed
by
a
corresponding
course
of
a
system
of
procedure
the
essence
of
the
religious
cult
is
to
determine
and
confine
nature
to
human
advantage
impress
it
with
a
legality
therefore
which
it
did
not
originally
while
at
the
present
time
we
wish
to
recognise
the
legality
of
nature
in
order
to
adapt
ourselves
to
it
in
short
then
the
religious
cult
is
based
upon
the
representations
of
sorcery
between
man
and
man
and
the
sorcerer
is
older
than
the
priest
but
it
is
likewise
based
upon
other
and
nobler
representations
it
premises
the
sympathetic
relation
of
man
to
man
the
presence
of
goodwill
gratitude
the
hearing
of
pleaders
of
treaties
between
enemies
the
granting
of
pledges
and
the
claim
to
the
protection
of
property
in
very
low
stages
of
civilisation
man
does
not
stand
in
the
relation
of
a
helpless
slave
to
nature
he
is
necessarily
its
involuntary
bondsman
in
the
grade
of
religion
particularly
in
relation
to
the
olympian
gods
there
may
even
be
imagined
a
common
life
between
two
castes
a
nobler
and
more
powerful
one
and
one
less
noble
but
in
their
origin
both
belong
to
each
other
somehow
and
are
of
one
kind
they
need
not
be
ashamed
of
each
other
that
is
the
nobility
of
the
greek
religion
at
the
sight
of
certain
antique
sacrificial
the
fact
of
how
many
feelings
are
lost
to
us
may
be
seen
for
instance
in
the
mingling
of
the
even
of
the
with
the
religious
feeling
the
sensation
of
the
possibility
of
this
mixture
vanishes
we
only
comprehend
historically
that
it
existed
in
the
feasts
of
demeter
and
dionysus
in
the
christian
and
mysteries
but
we
also
know
that
which
is
noble
in
alliance
with
burlesque
and
such
like
the
touching
mingled
with
the
laughable
which
perhaps
a
later
age
will
not
be
able
to
understand
christianity
as
when
on
a
sunday
morning
we
hear
the
old
bells
ring
out
we
ask
ourselves
is
it
possible
this
is
done
on
account
of
a
jew
crucified
two
thousand
years
ago
who
said
he
was
the
son
of
god
the
proof
of
such
an
assertion
is
wanting
certainly
in
our
times
the
christian
religion
is
an
antiquity
that
dates
from
very
early
ages
and
the
fact
that
its
assertions
are
still
believed
when
otherwise
all
claims
are
subjected
to
such
strict
examination
is
perhaps
the
oldest
part
of
this
heritage
a
god
who
creates
a
son
from
a
mortal
woman
a
sage
who
requires
that
man
should
no
longer
work
no
longer
judge
but
should
pay
attention
to
the
signs
of
the
approaching
end
of
the
world
a
justice
that
accepts
an
innocent
being
as
a
substitute
in
sacrifice
one
who
commands
his
disciples
to
drink
his
blood
prayers
for
miraculous
intervention
sins
committed
against
a
god
and
atoned
for
through
a
god
the
fear
of
a
future
to
which
death
is
the
portal
the
form
of
the
cross
in
an
age
which
no
longer
knows
the
signification
and
the
shame
of
the
cross
how
terrible
all
this
appears
to
us
as
if
risen
from
the
grave
of
the
ancient
past
is
it
credible
that
such
things
are
still
believed
what
is
in
the
greeks
did
not
regard
the
homeric
gods
as
raised
above
them
like
masters
nor
themselves
as
being
under
them
like
servants
as
the
jews
did
they
only
saw
as
in
a
mirror
the
most
perfect
examples
of
their
own
caste
an
ideal
therefore
and
not
an
opposite
of
their
own
nature
there
is
a
feeling
of
relationship
a
mutual
interest
arises
a
kind
of
symmachy
man
thinks
highly
of
himself
when
he
gives
himself
such
gods
and
places
himself
in
a
relation
like
that
of
the
lower
nobility
towards
the
higher
while
the
italian
nations
hold
a
genuine
with
perpetual
fear
of
evil
and
mischievous
powers
and
tormenting
spirits
wherever
the
olympian
gods
retreated
into
the
background
greek
life
was
more
sombre
and
more
anxious
christianity
on
the
contrary
oppressed
man
and
crushed
him
utterly
sinking
him
as
if
in
deep
mire
then
into
the
feeling
of
absolute
depravity
it
suddenly
threw
the
light
of
divine
mercy
so
that
the
surprised
man
dazzled
by
forgiveness
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
for
a
moment
believed
that
he
bore
all
heaven
within
himself
all
psychological
feelings
of
christianity
work
upon
this
unhealthy
excess
of
sentiment
and
upon
the
deep
corruption
of
head
and
heart
it
necessitates
it
desires
to
destroy
break
stupefy
confuse
only
one
thing
it
does
not
desire
namely
and
therefore
it
is
in
the
deepest
sense
barbaric
asiatic
ignoble
and
to
be
religious
with
there
are
sober
and
industrious
people
on
whom
religion
is
embroidered
like
a
hem
of
higher
humanity
these
do
well
to
remain
religious
it
beautifies
them
all
people
who
do
not
understand
some
kind
of
trade
in
weapons
tongue
and
pen
included
as
weapons
become
servile
for
such
the
christian
religion
is
very
useful
for
then
servility
assumes
the
appearance
of
christian
virtues
and
is
surprisingly
beautified
people
to
whom
their
daily
life
appears
too
empty
and
monotonous
easily
grow
religious
this
is
comprehensible
and
excusable
only
they
have
no
right
to
demand
religious
sentiments
from
those
whose
daily
life
is
not
empty
and
monotonous
the
commonplace
if
christianity
were
right
with
its
theories
of
an
avenging
god
of
general
sinfulness
of
redemption
and
the
danger
of
eternal
damnation
it
would
be
a
sign
of
weak
intellect
and
lack
of
character
to
become
a
priest
apostle
or
hermit
and
to
work
only
with
fear
and
trembling
for
one
own
salvation
it
would
be
senseless
thus
to
neglect
eternal
benefits
for
temporary
comfort
taking
it
for
granted
that
there
belief
the
commonplace
christian
is
a
miserable
figure
a
man
that
really
can
not
add
two
and
two
together
and
who
moreover
just
because
of
his
mental
incapacity
for
responsibility
did
not
deserve
to
be
so
severely
punished
as
christianity
has
decreed
of
the
wisdom
of
it
is
a
clever
stroke
on
the
part
of
christianity
to
teach
the
utter
unworthiness
sinfulness
and
despicableness
of
mankind
so
loudly
that
the
disdain
of
their
is
no
longer
possible
he
may
sin
as
much
as
he
likes
he
is
not
essentially
different
from
me
it
is
i
who
am
unworthy
and
despicable
in
every
way
says
the
christian
to
himself
but
even
this
feeling
has
lost
its
sharpest
sting
because
the
christian
no
longer
believes
in
his
individual
despicableness
he
is
bad
as
men
are
generally
and
comforts
himself
a
little
with
the
axiom
we
are
all
of
one
kind
change
of
as
soon
as
a
religion
triumphs
it
has
for
its
enemies
all
those
who
would
have
been
its
first
disciples
the
fate
of
christianity
arose
for
the
purpose
of
lightening
the
heart
but
now
it
must
first
make
the
heart
heavy
in
order
afterwards
to
lighten
it
consequently
it
will
perish
the
proof
of
the
agreeable
opinion
is
accepted
as
true
this
is
the
proof
of
the
pleasure
or
as
the
church
says
the
proof
of
the
strength
of
which
all
religions
are
so
proud
when
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it
if
faith
did
not
make
blessed
it
would
not
be
believed
in
of
how
little
value
must
it
be
then
a
dangerous
whoever
now
allows
scope
to
his
religious
feelings
must
also
let
them
increase
he
can
not
do
otherwise
his
nature
then
gradually
changes
it
favours
whatever
is
connected
with
and
near
to
the
religious
element
the
whole
extent
of
judgment
and
feeling
becomes
clouded
overcast
with
religious
shadows
sensation
can
not
stand
still
one
must
therefore
take
care
the
blind
so
long
as
one
knows
well
the
strength
and
weakness
of
one
doctrine
one
art
one
religion
its
power
is
still
small
the
disciple
and
apostle
who
has
no
eyes
for
the
weaknesses
of
the
doctrine
the
religion
and
so
forth
dazzled
by
the
aspect
of
the
master
and
by
his
reverence
for
him
has
on
that
account
usually
more
power
than
the
master
himself
without
blind
disciples
the
influence
of
a
man
and
his
work
has
never
yet
become
great
to
help
a
doctrine
to
victory
often
means
only
so
to
mix
it
with
stupidity
that
the
weight
of
the
latter
carries
off
also
the
victory
for
the
former
church
there
is
not
enough
religion
in
the
world
even
to
destroy
religions
the
sinlessness
of
if
it
is
understood
how
sin
came
into
the
world
namely
through
errors
of
reason
by
which
men
held
each
other
even
the
single
individual
held
himself
to
be
much
blacker
and
much
worse
than
was
actually
the
case
the
whole
sensation
will
be
much
lightened
and
man
and
the
world
will
appear
in
a
blaze
of
innocence
which
it
will
do
one
good
to
contemplate
in
the
midst
of
nature
man
is
always
the
child
this
child
sometimes
has
a
heavy
and
terrifying
dream
but
when
it
opens
its
eyes
it
always
finds
itself
back
again
in
paradise
the
irreligiousness
of
homer
is
so
much
at
home
amongst
his
gods
and
is
so
familiar
with
them
as
a
poet
that
he
must
have
been
deeply
irreligious
that
which
the
popular
faith
gave
him
a
meagre
rude
partly
terrible
superstition
he
treated
as
freely
as
the
sculptor
does
his
clay
with
the
same
unconcern
therefore
which
æschylus
and
aristophanes
possessed
and
by
which
in
later
times
the
great
artists
of
the
renaissance
distinguished
themselves
as
also
did
shakespeare
and
goethe
the
art
and
power
of
false
all
the
visions
terrors
torpors
and
ecstasies
of
saints
are
forms
of
disease
which
are
only
by
reason
of
religious
and
psychological
errors
differently
by
him
namely
not
as
diseases
thus
perhaps
the
of
socrates
was
only
an
affection
of
the
ear
which
he
in
accordance
with
his
ruling
moral
mode
of
thought
differently
from
what
would
be
the
case
now
it
is
the
same
thing
with
the
madness
and
ravings
of
the
prophets
and
soothsayers
it
is
always
the
degree
of
knowledge
fantasy
effort
morality
in
the
head
and
heart
of
the
which
has
so
much
of
it
for
the
greatest
achievements
of
the
people
who
are
called
geniuses
and
saints
it
is
necessary
that
they
should
secure
interpreters
by
force
who
them
for
the
good
of
mankind
the
veneration
of
because
it
was
remarked
that
excitement
frequently
made
the
mind
clearer
and
produced
happy
inspirations
it
was
believed
that
the
happiest
inspirations
and
suggestions
were
called
forth
by
the
greatest
excitement
and
so
the
insane
were
revered
as
wise
and
oracular
this
is
based
on
a
false
conclusion
the
promises
of
the
aim
of
modern
science
is
as
little
pain
as
possible
as
long
a
life
as
possible
a
kind
of
eternal
blessedness
therefore
but
certainly
a
very
modest
one
as
compared
with
the
promises
of
religions
forbidden
there
is
not
sufficient
love
and
goodness
in
the
world
to
permit
us
to
give
some
of
it
away
to
imaginary
beings
the
continuance
of
the
religious
cult
in
the
the
roman
catholic
church
and
before
that
all
antique
cults
dominated
the
entire
range
of
means
by
which
man
was
put
into
unaccustomed
moods
and
rendered
incapable
of
the
cold
calculation
of
judgment
or
the
clear
thinking
of
reason
a
church
quivering
with
deep
tones
the
dull
regular
arresting
appeals
of
a
priestly
throng
unconsciously
communicates
its
tension
to
the
congregation
and
makes
it
listen
almost
fearfully
as
if
a
miracle
were
in
preparation
the
influence
of
the
architecture
which
as
the
dwelling
of
a
godhead
extends
into
the
uncertain
and
makes
its
apparition
to
be
feared
in
all
its
sombre
spaces
who
would
wish
to
bring
such
things
back
to
mankind
if
the
necessary
suppositions
are
no
longer
believed
but
the
of
all
this
are
not
lost
nevertheless
the
inner
world
of
noble
emotional
deeply
contrite
dispositions
full
of
presentiments
blessed
with
hope
is
inborn
in
mankind
mainly
through
this
cult
what
exists
of
it
now
in
the
soul
was
then
cultivated
on
a
large
scale
as
it
germinated
grew
up
and
blossomed
the
painful
consequences
of
however
much
we
may
think
we
have
weaned
ourselves
from
religion
it
has
nevertheless
not
been
done
so
thoroughly
as
to
deprive
us
of
pleasure
in
encountering
religious
sensations
and
moods
in
music
for
instance
and
if
a
philosophy
shows
us
the
justification
of
metaphysical
hopes
and
the
deep
peace
of
soul
to
be
thence
acquired
and
speaks
for
instance
of
the
whole
certain
gospel
in
the
gaze
of
raphael
madonnas
we
receive
such
statements
and
expositions
particularly
warmly
here
the
philosopher
finds
it
easier
to
prove
that
which
he
desires
to
give
corresponds
to
a
heart
that
desires
to
receive
hence
it
may
be
observed
how
the
less
thoughtful
free
spirits
really
only
take
offence
at
the
dogmas
but
are
well
acquainted
with
the
charm
of
religious
sensations
they
are
sorry
to
lose
hold
of
the
latter
for
the
sake
of
the
former
scientific
philosophy
must
be
very
careful
not
to
smuggle
in
errors
on
the
ground
of
that
need
a
need
which
has
grown
up
and
is
consequently
temporary
even
logicians
speak
of
presentiments
of
truth
in
ethics
and
in
art
for
instance
of
the
suspicion
that
the
nature
of
things
is
one
which
should
be
forbidden
to
them
between
the
carefully
established
truths
and
such
presaged
things
there
remains
the
unbridgable
chasm
that
those
are
due
to
intellect
and
these
to
requirement
hunger
does
not
prove
that
food
to
satisfy
it
but
that
it
desires
food
to
presage
does
not
mean
the
acknowledgment
of
the
existence
of
a
thing
in
any
one
degree
but
its
possibility
in
so
far
as
it
is
desired
or
feared
presage
does
not
advance
one
step
into
the
land
of
certainty
we
believe
involuntarily
that
the
portions
of
a
philosophy
which
are
tinged
with
religion
are
better
proved
than
others
but
actually
it
is
the
contrary
but
we
have
the
inward
desire
that
it
be
so
that
that
which
makes
blessed
therefore
may
be
also
the
true
this
desire
misleads
us
to
accept
bad
reasons
for
good
ones
of
the
christian
need
of
with
careful
reflection
it
must
be
possible
to
obtain
an
explanation
free
from
mythology
of
that
process
in
the
soul
of
a
christian
which
is
called
the
need
of
redemption
consequently
a
purely
psychological
explanation
up
to
the
present
the
psychological
explanations
of
religious
conditions
and
processes
have
certainly
been
held
in
some
disrepute
inasmuch
as
a
theology
which
called
itself
free
carried
on
its
unprofitable
practice
in
this
domain
for
here
from
the
beginning
as
the
mind
of
its
founder
schleiermacher
gives
us
reason
to
suppose
the
preservation
of
the
christian
religion
and
the
continuance
of
christian
theology
was
kept
in
view
a
theology
which
was
to
find
a
new
anchorage
in
the
psychological
analyses
of
religious
facts
and
above
all
a
new
occupation
unconcerned
about
such
predecessors
we
hazard
the
following
interpretation
of
the
phenomenon
in
question
man
is
conscious
of
certain
actions
which
stand
far
down
in
the
customary
rank
of
actions
he
even
discovers
in
himself
a
tendency
towards
similar
actions
a
tendency
which
appears
to
him
almost
as
unchangeable
as
his
whole
nature
how
willingly
would
he
try
himself
in
that
other
species
of
actions
which
in
the
general
valuation
are
recognised
as
the
loftiest
and
highest
how
gladly
would
he
feel
himself
to
be
full
of
the
good
consciousness
which
should
follow
an
unselfish
mode
of
thought
but
unfortunately
he
stops
short
at
this
wish
and
the
discontent
at
not
being
able
to
satisfy
it
is
added
to
all
the
other
discontents
which
his
lot
in
life
or
the
consequences
of
those
evil
actions
have
aroused
in
him
so
that
a
deep
is
the
result
with
the
search
for
a
physician
who
could
remove
this
and
all
its
causes
this
condition
would
not
be
felt
so
bitterly
if
man
would
only
compare
himself
frankly
with
other
men
then
he
would
have
no
reason
for
being
dissatisfied
with
himself
to
a
particular
extent
he
would
only
bear
his
share
of
the
common
burden
of
human
dissatisfaction
and
imperfection
but
he
compares
himself
with
a
being
who
is
said
to
be
capable
only
of
those
actions
which
are
called
and
to
live
in
the
perpetual
consciousness
of
an
unselfish
mode
of
thought
with
god
it
is
because
he
gazes
into
this
clear
mirror
that
his
image
appears
to
him
so
dark
so
unusually
warped
then
he
is
alarmed
by
the
thought
of
that
same
creature
in
so
far
as
it
floats
before
his
imagination
as
a
retributive
justice
in
all
possible
small
and
great
events
he
thinks
he
recognises
its
anger
and
menaces
that
he
even
feels
its
as
judge
and
executioner
who
will
help
him
in
this
danger
which
by
the
prospect
of
an
immeasurable
duration
of
punishment
exceeds
in
horror
all
the
other
terrors
of
the
idea
before
we
examine
the
further
consequences
of
this
mental
state
let
us
acknowledge
that
it
is
not
through
his
guilt
and
sin
that
man
has
got
into
this
condition
but
through
a
series
of
errors
of
reason
that
it
was
the
fault
of
the
mirror
if
his
image
appeared
so
dark
and
hateful
to
him
and
that
that
mirror
was
work
the
very
imperfect
work
of
human
imagination
and
power
of
judgment
in
the
first
place
a
nature
that
is
only
capable
of
purely
actions
is
more
fabulous
than
the
phœnix
it
can
not
even
be
clearly
imagined
just
because
when
closely
examined
the
whole
idea
action
vanishes
into
air
no
man
did
a
thing
which
was
done
only
for
others
and
without
any
personal
motive
how
should
he
be
to
do
anything
which
had
no
relation
to
himself
and
therefore
without
inward
obligation
which
must
always
have
its
foundation
in
a
personal
need
how
could
the
act
without
a
god
who
on
the
contrary
is
love
as
such
a
one
is
often
represented
would
not
be
capable
of
a
single
action
whereby
one
is
reminded
of
a
saying
of
lichtenberg
which
is
certainly
taken
from
a
lower
sphere
we
can
not
possibly
for
others
as
the
saying
is
we
feel
only
for
ourselves
this
sounds
hard
but
it
is
not
so
really
if
it
be
rightly
understood
we
do
not
love
father
or
mother
or
wife
or
child
but
the
pleasant
sensations
they
cause
us
or
as
rochefoucauld
says
on
croit
aimer
sa
maîtresse
pour
on
est
bien
to
know
the
reason
why
actions
of
love
are
valued
more
than
others
not
on
account
of
their
nature
namely
but
of
their
we
should
compare
the
examinations
already
mentioned
the
origin
of
moral
but
should
a
man
desire
to
be
entirely
like
that
god
of
love
to
do
and
wish
everything
for
others
and
nothing
for
himself
the
latter
is
impossible
for
the
reason
that
he
must
do
for
himself
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
the
love
of
others
then
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
the
other
is
sufficiently
egoistic
to
accept
that
sacrifice
again
and
again
that
living
for
him
so
that
the
people
of
love
and
sacrifice
have
an
interest
in
the
continuance
of
those
who
are
loveless
and
incapable
of
sacrifice
and
in
order
to
exist
the
highest
morality
would
be
obliged
positively
to
the
existence
of
whereby
it
would
certainly
annihilate
itself
further
the
conception
of
a
god
disturbs
and
humbles
so
long
as
it
is
believed
in
but
as
to
how
it
arose
there
can
no
longer
be
any
doubt
in
the
present
state
of
the
science
of
comparative
ethnology
and
with
a
comprehension
of
this
origin
all
belief
falls
to
the
ground
the
christian
who
compares
his
nature
with
god
is
like
don
quixote
who
his
own
bravery
because
his
head
was
full
of
the
marvellous
deeds
of
the
heroes
of
the
chivalric
romances
the
standard
of
measurement
in
both
cases
belongs
to
the
domain
of
fable
but
if
the
idea
of
god
is
removed
so
is
also
the
feeling
of
sin
as
a
trespass
against
divine
laws
as
a
stain
in
a
creature
vowed
to
god
then
perhaps
there
still
remains
that
dejection
which
is
intergrown
and
connected
with
the
fear
of
the
punishment
of
worldly
justice
or
of
the
scorn
of
men
the
dejection
of
the
pricks
of
conscience
the
sharpest
thorn
in
the
consciousness
of
sin
is
always
removed
if
we
recognise
that
though
by
our
own
deed
we
have
sinned
against
human
descent
human
laws
and
ordinances
still
that
we
have
not
imperilled
the
eternal
salvation
of
the
soul
and
its
relation
to
the
godhead
and
if
man
succeeds
in
gaining
philosophic
conviction
of
the
absolute
necessity
of
all
actions
and
their
entire
irresponsibility
and
absorbing
this
into
his
flesh
and
blood
even
those
remains
of
the
pricks
of
conscience
vanish
now
if
the
christian
as
we
have
said
has
fallen
into
the
way
of
in
consequence
of
certain
errors
through
a
false
unscientific
interpretation
of
his
actions
and
sensations
he
must
notice
with
great
surprise
how
that
state
of
contempt
the
pricks
of
conscience
and
displeasure
generally
does
not
endure
how
sometimes
there
come
hours
when
all
this
is
wafted
away
from
his
soul
and
he
feels
himself
once
more
free
and
courageous
in
truth
the
pleasure
in
himself
the
comfort
of
his
own
strength
together
with
the
necessary
weakening
through
time
of
every
deep
emotion
has
usually
been
victorious
man
loves
himself
once
again
he
feels
it
but
precisely
this
new
love
this
seems
to
him
incredible
he
can
only
see
in
it
the
wholly
undeserved
descent
of
a
stream
of
mercy
from
on
high
if
he
formerly
believed
that
in
every
event
he
could
recognise
warnings
menaces
punishments
and
every
kind
of
manifestation
of
divine
anger
he
now
finds
divine
goodness
in
all
his
experiences
this
event
appears
to
him
to
be
full
of
love
that
one
a
helpful
hint
a
third
and
indeed
his
whole
happy
mood
a
proof
that
god
is
merciful
as
formerly
in
his
state
of
pain
he
interpreted
his
actions
falsely
so
now
he
misinterprets
his
experiences
his
mood
of
comfort
he
believes
to
be
the
working
of
a
power
operating
outside
of
himself
the
love
with
which
he
really
loves
himself
seems
to
him
to
be
divine
love
that
which
he
calls
mercy
and
the
prologue
to
redemption
is
actually
therefore
a
certain
false
psychology
a
certain
kind
of
imaginative
interpretation
of
motives
and
experiences
is
the
necessary
preliminary
for
one
to
become
a
christian
and
to
feel
the
need
of
redemption
when
this
error
of
reason
and
imagination
is
recognised
one
ceases
to
be
a
christian
of
christian
asceticism
and
as
greatly
as
isolated
thinkers
have
endeavoured
to
depict
as
a
miracle
the
rare
manifestations
of
morality
which
are
generally
called
asceticism
and
holiness
miracles
which
it
would
be
almost
an
outrage
and
sacrilege
to
explain
by
the
light
of
common
sense
as
strong
also
is
the
inclination
towards
this
outrage
a
mighty
impulse
of
nature
has
at
all
times
led
to
a
protest
against
those
manifestations
science
in
so
far
as
it
is
an
imitation
of
nature
at
least
allows
itself
to
rise
against
the
supposed
inexplicableness
and
unapproachableness
of
these
objections
so
far
it
has
certainly
not
succeeded
those
appearances
are
still
unexplained
to
the
great
joy
of
the
worshippers
of
the
morally
marvellous
for
speaking
generally
the
unexplained
be
absolutely
inexplicable
the
inexplicable
absolutely
unnatural
supernatural
wonderful
thus
runs
the
demand
in
the
souls
of
all
religious
and
metaphysical
people
also
of
artists
if
they
should
happen
to
be
thinkers
at
the
same
time
whilst
the
scientist
sees
in
this
demand
the
evil
principle
in
itself
the
general
first
probability
upon
which
one
lights
in
the
contemplation
of
holiness
and
asceticism
is
this
that
their
nature
is
a
one
for
almost
everywhere
within
the
physical
world
as
well
as
in
the
moral
the
apparently
marvellous
has
been
successfully
traced
back
to
the
complicated
the
let
us
venture
therefore
to
isolate
separate
impulses
from
the
soul
of
saints
and
ascetics
and
finally
to
imagine
them
as
intergrown
there
is
a
of
self
to
the
sublimest
manifestation
of
which
belong
many
forms
of
asceticism
certain
individuals
have
such
great
need
of
exercising
their
power
and
love
of
ruling
that
in
default
of
other
objects
or
because
they
have
never
succeeded
otherwise
they
finally
the
idea
of
tyrannising
over
certain
parts
of
their
own
nature
portions
or
degrees
of
themselves
thus
many
a
thinker
confesses
to
views
which
evidently
do
not
serve
either
to
increase
or
improve
his
reputation
many
a
one
deliberately
calls
down
the
scorn
of
others
when
by
keeping
silence
he
could
easily
have
remained
respected
others
contradict
former
opinions
and
do
not
hesitate
to
be
called
inconsistent
on
the
contrary
they
strive
after
this
and
behave
like
reckless
riders
who
like
a
horse
best
when
it
has
grown
wild
unmanageable
and
covered
with
sweat
thus
man
climbs
dangerous
paths
up
the
highest
mountains
in
order
that
he
may
laugh
to
scorn
his
own
fear
and
his
trembling
knees
thus
the
philosopher
owns
to
views
on
asceticism
humility
holiness
in
the
brightness
of
which
his
own
picture
shows
to
the
worst
possible
disadvantage
this
crushing
of
one
self
this
scorn
of
one
own
nature
this
se
sperm
of
which
religion
has
made
so
much
is
really
a
very
high
degree
of
vanity
the
whole
moral
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
belongs
here
man
takes
a
genuine
delight
in
doing
violence
to
himself
by
these
exaggerated
claims
and
afterwards
idolising
these
tyrannical
demands
of
his
soul
in
every
ascetic
morality
man
worships
one
part
of
himself
as
a
god
and
is
obliged
therefore
to
diabolise
the
other
parts
man
is
not
equally
moral
at
all
hours
this
is
well
known
if
his
morality
is
judged
to
be
the
capability
for
great
resolutions
and
which
when
continuous
and
grown
habitual
are
called
holiness
he
is
most
moral
in
the
the
higher
emotion
provides
him
with
entirely
new
motives
of
which
he
sober
and
cold
as
usual
perhaps
does
not
even
believe
himself
capable
how
does
this
happen
probably
because
of
the
proximity
of
everything
great
and
highly
exciting
if
man
is
once
wrought
up
to
a
state
of
extraordinary
suspense
he
is
as
capable
of
carrying
out
a
terrible
revenge
as
of
a
terrible
crushing
of
his
need
for
revenge
under
the
influence
of
powerful
emotion
he
desires
in
any
case
the
great
the
powerful
the
immense
and
if
he
happens
to
notice
that
the
sacrifice
of
himself
satisfies
him
as
well
as
or
better
than
the
sacrifice
of
others
he
chooses
that
actually
therefore
he
only
cares
about
discharging
his
emotion
in
order
to
ease
his
tension
he
seizes
the
enemy
spears
and
buries
them
in
his
breast
that
there
was
something
great
in
and
not
in
revenge
had
to
be
taught
to
mankind
by
long
habit
a
godhead
that
sacrificed
itself
was
the
strongest
most
effective
symbol
of
this
kind
of
greatness
as
the
conquest
of
the
most
difficult
enemy
the
sudden
mastering
of
an
affection
thus
this
denial
and
so
far
it
passes
for
the
summit
of
morality
in
reality
it
is
a
question
of
the
confusion
of
one
idea
with
another
while
the
temperament
maintains
an
equal
height
an
equal
level
temperate
men
who
are
resting
from
their
passions
no
longer
understand
the
morality
of
those
moments
but
the
general
admiration
of
those
who
had
the
same
experiences
upholds
them
pride
is
their
consolation
when
affection
and
the
understanding
of
their
deed
vanish
therefore
at
bottom
even
those
actions
of
are
not
moral
inasmuch
as
they
are
not
done
strictly
with
regard
to
others
rather
the
other
only
provides
the
temperament
with
an
opportunity
of
relieving
itself
through
that
denial
in
many
respects
the
ascetic
seeks
to
make
life
easy
for
himself
usually
by
complete
subordination
to
a
strange
will
or
a
comprehensive
law
and
ritual
something
like
the
way
a
brahmin
leaves
nothing
whatever
to
his
own
decision
but
refers
every
moment
to
holy
precepts
this
submission
is
a
powerful
means
of
attaining
man
is
occupied
and
is
therefore
not
bored
and
yet
has
no
incitement
to
or
passion
after
a
completed
deed
there
is
no
feeling
of
responsibility
and
with
it
no
tortures
of
remorse
we
have
renounced
our
own
will
once
and
for
ever
and
this
is
easier
than
only
renouncing
it
occasionally
as
it
is
also
easier
to
give
up
a
desire
entirely
than
to
keep
it
within
bounds
when
we
remember
the
present
relation
of
man
to
the
state
we
find
that
even
here
unconditional
obedience
is
more
convenient
than
conditional
the
saint
therefore
makes
his
life
easier
by
absolute
renunciation
of
his
personality
and
we
are
mistaken
if
in
that
phenomenon
we
admire
the
loftiest
heroism
of
morality
in
any
case
it
is
more
difficult
to
carry
one
personality
through
without
vacillation
and
unclearness
than
to
liberate
one
self
from
it
in
the
manner
moreover
it
requires
far
more
spirit
and
consideration
after
having
found
in
many
of
the
less
easily
explicable
actions
manifestations
of
that
pleasure
in
per
se
i
should
like
to
recognise
also
in
which
is
one
of
the
signs
of
holiness
and
likewise
in
the
deeds
of
through
hunger
and
scourging
mutilation
of
limbs
feigning
of
madness
a
means
by
which
those
natures
fight
against
the
general
weariness
of
their
their
nerves
they
employ
the
most
painful
irritants
and
cruelties
in
order
to
emerge
for
a
time
at
all
events
from
that
dulness
and
boredom
into
which
they
so
frequently
sink
through
their
great
mental
indolence
and
that
submission
to
a
strange
will
already
described
the
commonest
means
which
the
ascetic
and
saint
employs
to
render
life
still
endurable
and
amusing
consists
in
occasional
warfare
with
alternate
victory
and
defeat
for
this
he
requires
an
opponent
and
finds
it
in
the
inward
enemy
he
principally
makes
use
of
his
inclination
to
vanity
love
of
honour
and
rule
and
of
his
sensual
desires
that
he
may
be
permitted
to
regard
his
life
as
a
perpetual
battle
and
himself
as
a
battlefield
upon
which
good
and
evil
spirits
strive
with
alternating
success
it
is
well
known
that
sensual
imagination
is
moderated
indeed
almost
dispelled
by
regular
sexual
intercourse
whereas
on
the
contrary
it
is
rendered
unfettered
and
wild
by
abstinence
or
irregularity
the
imagination
of
many
christian
saints
was
filthy
to
an
extraordinary
degree
by
virtue
of
those
theories
that
these
desires
were
actual
demons
raging
within
them
they
did
not
feel
themselves
to
be
too
responsible
to
this
feeling
we
owe
the
very
instructive
frankness
of
their
it
was
to
their
interest
that
this
strife
should
always
be
maintained
in
one
degree
or
another
because
as
we
have
already
said
their
empty
life
was
thereby
entertained
but
in
order
that
the
strife
might
seem
sufficiently
important
and
arouse
the
enduring
sympathy
and
admiration
of
it
was
necessary
that
sensuality
should
be
ever
more
reviled
and
branded
the
danger
of
eternal
damnation
was
so
tightly
bound
up
with
these
things
that
it
is
highly
probable
that
for
whole
centuries
christians
generated
children
with
a
bad
conscience
wherewith
humanity
has
certainly
suffered
a
great
injury
and
yet
here
truth
is
all
which
is
particularly
unsuitable
for
truth
certainly
christianity
had
said
that
every
man
is
conceived
and
born
in
sin
and
in
the
insupportable
of
calderon
this
thought
again
appears
tied
up
and
twisted
as
the
most
distorted
paradox
there
is
in
the
lines
the
greatest
sin
of
man
is
that
he
was
ever
born
in
all
pessimistic
religions
the
act
of
generation
was
looked
upon
as
evil
in
itself
this
is
by
no
means
the
verdict
of
all
mankind
not
even
of
all
pessimists
for
instance
empedocles
saw
in
all
erotic
things
nothing
shameful
diabolical
or
sinful
but
rather
in
the
great
plain
of
disaster
he
saw
only
one
hopeful
and
redeeming
figure
that
of
aphrodite
she
appeared
to
him
as
a
guarantee
that
the
strife
should
not
endure
eternally
but
that
the
sceptre
should
one
day
be
given
over
to
a
gentler
the
actual
christian
pessimists
had
as
has
been
said
an
interest
in
the
dominance
of
a
diverse
opinion
for
the
solitude
and
spiritual
wilderness
of
their
lives
they
required
an
ever
living
enemy
and
a
generally
recognised
enemy
through
whose
fighting
and
overcoming
they
could
constantly
represent
themselves
to
the
as
incomprehensible
half
supernatural
beings
but
when
at
last
this
enemy
took
to
flight
for
ever
in
consequence
of
their
mode
of
life
and
their
impaired
health
they
immediately
understood
how
to
populate
their
interior
with
new
dæmons
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
scales
of
pride
and
humility
sustained
their
brooding
minds
as
well
as
the
alternations
of
desire
and
peace
of
soul
at
that
time
psychology
served
not
only
to
cast
suspicion
upon
everything
human
but
to
oppress
to
scourge
to
crucify
people
to
find
themselves
as
bad
and
wicked
as
possible
they
anxiety
for
the
salvation
of
their
souls
despair
of
their
own
strength
everything
natural
with
which
man
has
connected
the
idea
of
evil
and
sin
as
for
instance
he
is
still
accustomed
to
do
with
regard
to
the
erotic
troubles
and
clouds
the
imagination
causes
a
frightened
glance
makes
man
quarrel
with
himself
and
uncertain
and
distrustful
of
himself
even
his
dreams
have
the
flavour
of
a
restless
conscience
and
yet
in
the
reality
of
things
this
suffering
from
what
is
natural
is
entirely
without
foundation
it
is
only
the
consequence
of
opinions
things
it
is
easily
seen
how
men
grow
worse
by
considering
the
as
bad
and
afterwards
always
feeling
themselves
made
thus
it
is
the
of
religion
and
metaphysics
which
wish
to
have
man
evil
and
sinful
by
nature
to
cast
suspicion
on
nature
and
thus
really
to
him
bad
for
he
learns
to
feel
himself
evil
since
he
can
not
divest
himself
of
the
clothing
of
nature
after
living
for
long
a
natural
life
he
gradually
comes
to
feel
himself
weighed
down
by
such
a
burden
of
sin
that
supernatural
powers
are
necessary
to
lift
this
burden
and
therewith
arises
the
need
of
redemption
which
corresponds
to
no
real
but
only
to
an
imaginary
sinfulness
if
we
survey
the
separate
moral
demands
of
the
earliest
times
of
christianity
it
will
everywhere
be
found
that
requirements
are
exaggerated
in
order
that
man
satisfy
them
the
intention
is
not
that
he
should
become
more
moral
but
that
he
should
feel
himself
as
as
if
man
had
not
found
this
feeling
why
would
he
have
thought
out
such
an
idea
and
stuck
to
it
so
long
as
in
the
antique
world
an
immeasurable
power
of
intellect
and
inventiveness
was
expended
in
multiplying
the
pleasure
of
life
by
festive
cults
so
also
in
the
age
of
christianity
an
immeasurable
amount
of
intellect
has
been
sacrificed
to
another
endeavour
man
must
by
all
means
be
made
to
feel
himself
sinful
and
thereby
be
excited
to
excite
enliven
at
all
costs
is
not
that
the
watchword
of
a
relaxed
age
the
range
of
all
natural
sensations
had
been
gone
over
a
hundred
times
the
soul
had
grown
weary
whereupon
the
saint
and
the
ascetic
invented
a
new
species
of
stimulants
for
life
they
presented
themselves
before
the
public
eye
not
exactly
as
an
example
for
the
many
but
as
a
terrible
and
yet
ravishing
spectacle
which
took
place
on
that
between
world
and
wherein
at
that
time
all
people
believed
they
saw
now
rays
of
heavenly
light
and
now
unholy
tongues
of
flame
glowing
in
the
depths
the
saint
eye
fixed
upon
the
terrible
meaning
of
this
short
earthly
life
upon
the
nearness
of
the
last
decision
concerning
endless
new
spans
of
existence
this
burning
eye
in
a
body
made
men
of
the
old
world
tremble
to
their
very
depths
to
gaze
to
turn
shudderingly
away
to
feel
anew
the
attraction
of
the
spectacle
and
to
give
way
to
it
to
drink
deep
of
it
till
the
soul
quivered
with
fire
and
ague
that
was
the
last
that
antiquity
after
it
had
grown
blunted
even
at
the
sight
of
and
human
combats
now
to
sum
up
that
condition
of
soul
in
which
the
saint
or
embryo
saint
rejoiced
was
composed
of
elements
which
we
all
know
well
only
that
under
the
influence
of
other
than
religious
conceptions
they
exhibit
themselves
in
other
colours
and
are
then
accustomed
to
encounter
man
blame
as
fully
as
with
that
decoration
of
religion
and
the
ultimate
meaning
of
existence
they
may
reckon
on
receiving
admiration
and
even
worship
might
reckon
at
least
in
former
ages
sometimes
the
saint
practises
that
defiance
of
himself
which
is
a
near
relative
of
domination
at
any
cost
and
gives
a
feeling
of
power
even
to
the
most
lonely
sometimes
his
swollen
sensibility
leaps
from
the
desire
to
let
his
passions
have
full
play
into
the
desire
to
overthrow
them
like
wild
horses
under
the
mighty
pressure
of
a
proud
spirit
sometimes
he
desires
a
complete
cessation
of
all
disturbing
tormenting
irritating
sensations
a
waking
sleep
a
lasting
rest
in
the
lap
of
a
dull
animal
and
indolence
sometimes
he
seeks
strife
and
arouses
it
within
himself
because
boredom
has
shown
him
its
yawning
countenance
he
scourges
his
with
and
cruelty
he
rejoices
in
the
wild
tumult
of
his
desires
and
the
sharp
pain
of
sin
even
in
the
idea
of
being
lost
he
understands
how
to
lay
a
trap
for
his
emotions
for
instance
even
for
his
keen
love
of
ruling
so
that
he
sinks
into
the
most
utter
abasement
and
his
tormented
soul
is
thrown
out
of
joint
by
this
contrast
and
finally
if
he
longs
for
visions
conversations
with
the
dead
or
with
divine
beings
it
is
at
bottom
a
rare
kind
of
delight
that
he
covets
perhaps
that
delight
in
which
all
others
are
united
novalis
an
authority
on
questions
of
holiness
through
experience
and
instinct
tells
the
whole
secret
with
naïve
joy
it
is
strange
enough
that
the
association
of
lust
religion
and
cruelty
did
not
long
ago
draw
men
attention
to
their
close
relationship
and
common
tendency
that
which
gives
the
saint
his
historical
value
is
not
the
thing
he
but
the
thing
he
in
the
eyes
of
the
unsaintly
it
was
through
the
fact
that
errors
were
made
about
him
that
the
state
of
his
soul
was
interpreted
that
men
separated
themselves
from
him
as
much
as
possible
as
from
something
incomparable
and
strangely
superhuman
that
he
acquired
the
extraordinary
power
which
he
exercised
over
the
imagination
of
whole
nations
and
whole
ages
he
did
not
know
himself
he
himself
interpreted
the
writing
of
his
moods
inclinations
and
actions
according
to
an
art
of
interpretation
which
was
as
exaggerated
and
artificial
as
the
spiritual
interpretation
of
the
bible
the
distorted
and
diseased
in
his
nature
with
its
combination
of
intellectual
poverty
evil
knowledge
ruined
health
and
nerves
remained
hidden
from
his
own
sight
as
well
as
from
that
of
his
spectators
he
was
not
a
particularly
good
man
and
still
less
was
he
a
particularly
wise
one
but
he
something
that
exceeded
the
human
standard
in
goodness
and
wisdom
the
belief
in
him
supported
the
belief
in
the
divine
and
miraculous
in
a
religious
meaning
of
all
existence
in
an
impending
day
of
judgment
in
the
evening
glory
of
the
world
sunset
which
glowed
over
the
christian
nations
the
shadowy
form
of
the
saint
grew
to
vast
dimensions
it
grew
to
such
a
height
that
even
in
our
own
age
which
no
longer
believes
in
god
there
are
still
thinkers
who
believe
in
the
saint
it
need
not
be
said
that
to
this
description
of
the
saint
which
has
been
made
from
an
average
of
the
whole
species
there
may
be
opposed
many
a
description
which
could
give
a
more
agreeable
impression
certain
exceptions
stand
out
from
among
this
species
it
may
be
through
great
mildness
and
philanthropy
it
may
be
through
the
magic
of
unusual
energy
others
are
attractive
in
the
highest
degree
because
certain
wild
ravings
have
poured
streams
of
light
on
their
whole
being
as
is
the
case
for
instance
with
the
famous
founder
of
christianity
who
thought
he
was
the
son
of
god
and
therefore
felt
himself
sinless
so
that
through
this
idea
which
we
must
not
judge
too
hardly
because
the
whole
antique
world
swarms
with
sons
of
god
he
reached
that
same
goal
that
feeling
of
complete
sinlessness
complete
irresponsibility
which
every
one
can
now
acquire
by
means
of
science
neither
have
i
mentioned
the
indian
saints
who
stand
midway
between
the
christian
saint
and
the
greek
philosopher
and
in
so
far
represent
no
pure
type
knowledge
science
such
as
existed
then
the
uplifting
above
other
men
through
logical
discipline
and
training
of
thought
were
as
much
fostered
by
the
buddhists
as
distinguishing
signs
of
holiness
as
the
same
qualities
in
the
christian
world
are
repressed
and
branded
as
signs
of
unholiness

this
may
give
us
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
religiosity
still
happily
prevailing
in
england
and
the
united
fourth
division
concerning
the
soul
of
artists
and
authors
the
perfect
should
not
have
with
regard
to
everything
that
is
perfect
we
are
accustomed
to
omit
the
question
as
to
how
perfection
has
been
acquired
and
we
only
rejoice
in
the
present
as
if
it
had
sprung
out
of
the
ground
by
magic
probably
with
regard
to
this
matter
we
are
still
under
the
effects
of
an
ancient
mythological
feeling
it
still
seems
to
us
in
such
a
greek
temple
for
instance
as
that
of
pæstum
as
if
one
morning
a
god
in
sport
had
built
his
dwelling
of
such
enormous
masses
at
other
times
it
seems
as
if
his
spirit
had
suddenly
entered
into
a
stone
and
now
desired
to
speak
through
it
the
artist
knows
that
his
work
is
only
fully
effective
if
it
arouses
the
belief
in
an
improvisation
in
a
marvellous
instantaneousness
of
origin
and
thus
he
assists
this
illusion
and
introduces
into
art
those
elements
of
inspired
unrest
of
blindly
groping
disorder
of
listening
dreaming
at
the
beginning
of
creation
as
a
means
of
deception
in
order
so
to
influence
the
soul
of
the
spectator
or
hearer
that
it
may
believe
in
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
perfect
it
is
the
business
of
the
science
of
art
to
contradict
this
illusion
most
decidedly
and
to
show
up
the
mistakes
and
pampering
of
the
intellect
by
means
of
which
it
falls
into
the
artist
trap
the
artist
sense
of
with
regard
to
recognition
of
truths
the
artist
has
a
weaker
morality
than
the
thinker
he
will
on
no
account
let
himself
be
deprived
of
brilliant
and
profound
interpretations
of
life
and
defends
himself
against
temperate
and
simple
methods
and
results
he
is
apparently
fighting
for
the
higher
worthiness
and
meaning
of
mankind
in
reality
he
will
not
renounce
the
suppositions
for
his
art
the
fantastical
mythical
uncertain
extreme
the
sense
of
the
symbolical
the
of
personality
the
belief
that
genius
is
something
miraculous
he
considers
therefore
the
continuance
of
his
art
of
creation
as
more
important
than
the
scientific
devotion
to
truth
in
every
shape
however
simple
this
may
appear
art
as
raiser
of
the
art
also
fulfils
the
task
of
preservation
and
even
of
brightening
up
extinguished
and
faded
memories
when
it
accomplishes
this
task
it
weaves
a
rope
round
the
ages
and
causes
their
spirits
to
return
it
is
certainly
only
a
that
results
therefrom
as
out
of
graves
or
like
the
return
in
dreams
of
our
beloved
dead
but
for
some
moments
at
least
the
old
sensation
lives
again
and
the
heart
beats
to
an
almost
forgotten
time
hence
for
the
sake
of
the
general
usefulness
of
art
the
artist
himself
must
be
excused
if
he
does
not
stand
in
the
front
rank
of
the
enlightenment
and
progressive
civilisation
of
humanity
all
his
life
long
he
has
remained
a
child
or
a
youth
and
has
stood
still
at
the
point
where
he
was
overcome
by
his
artistic
impulse
the
feelings
of
the
first
years
of
life
however
are
acknowledged
to
be
nearer
to
those
of
earlier
times
than
to
those
of
the
present
century
unconsciously
it
becomes
his
mission
to
make
mankind
more
childlike
this
is
his
glory
and
his
limitation
poets
as
the
lighteners
of
poets
inasmuch
as
they
desire
to
lighten
the
life
of
man
either
divert
his
gaze
from
the
wearisome
present
or
assist
the
present
to
acquire
new
colours
by
means
of
a
life
which
they
cause
to
shine
out
of
the
past
to
be
able
to
do
this
they
must
in
many
respects
themselves
be
beings
who
are
turned
towards
the
past
so
that
they
can
be
used
as
bridges
to
far
distant
times
and
ideas
to
dying
or
dead
religions
and
cultures
actually
they
are
always
and
of
necessity
there
are
however
certain
drawbacks
to
their
means
of
lightening
life
they
appease
and
heal
only
temporarily
only
for
the
moment
they
even
prevent
men
from
labouring
towards
a
genuine
improvement
in
their
conditions
inasmuch
as
they
remove
and
apply
palliatives
to
precisely
that
passion
of
discontent
that
induces
to
action
the
slow
arrow
of
the
noblest
kind
of
beauty
is
that
which
does
not
transport
us
suddenly
which
does
not
make
stormy
and
intoxicating
impressions
such
a
kind
easily
arouses
disgust
but
that
which
slowly
filter
into
our
minds
which
we
take
away
with
us
almost
unnoticed
and
which
we
encounter
again
in
our
dreams
but
which
however
after
having
long
lain
modestly
on
our
hearts
takes
entire
possession
of
us
fills
our
eyes
with
tears
and
our
hearts
with
longing
what
is
it
that
we
long
for
at
the
sight
of
beauty
we
long
to
be
beautiful
we
fancy
it
must
bring
much
happiness
with
it
but
that
is
a
mistake
the
animation
of
art
raises
its
head
where
creeds
relax
it
takes
over
many
feelings
and
moods
engendered
by
religion
lays
them
to
its
heart
and
itself
becomes
deeper
more
full
of
soul
so
that
it
is
capable
of
transmitting
exultation
and
enthusiasm
which
it
previously
was
not
able
to
do
the
abundance
of
religious
feelings
which
have
grown
into
a
stream
are
always
breaking
forth
again
and
desire
to
conquer
new
kingdoms
but
the
growing
enlightenment
has
shaken
the
dogmas
of
religion
and
inspired
a
deep
mistrust
thus
the
feeling
thrust
by
enlightenment
out
of
the
religious
sphere
throws
itself
upon
art
in
a
few
cases
into
political
life
even
straight
into
science
everywhere
where
human
endeavour
wears
a
loftier
gloomier
aspect
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
fear
of
spirits
incense
and
have
remained
attached
to
it
how
rhythm
rhythm
casts
a
veil
over
reality
it
causes
various
artificialities
of
speech
and
obscurities
of
thought
by
the
shadow
it
throws
upon
thought
it
sometimes
conceals
it
and
sometimes
brings
it
into
prominence
as
shadow
is
necessary
to
beauty
so
the
dull
is
necessary
to
lucidity
art
makes
the
aspect
of
life
endurable
by
throwing
lover
it
the
veil
of
obscure
thought
the
art
of
the
ugly
art
is
confined
within
too
narrow
limits
if
it
be
required
that
only
the
orderly
respectable
soul
should
be
allowed
to
express
itself
therein
as
in
the
plastic
arts
so
also
in
music
and
poetry
there
is
an
art
of
the
ugly
soul
side
by
side
with
the
art
of
the
beautiful
soul
and
the
mightiest
effects
of
art
the
crushing
of
souls
moving
of
stones
and
humanising
of
beasts
have
perhaps
been
best
achieved
precisely
by
that
art
art
makes
heavy
the
heart
of
the
how
strong
metaphysical
need
is
and
how
difficult
nature
renders
our
departure
from
it
may
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
even
in
the
free
spirit
when
he
has
cast
off
everything
metaphysical
the
loftiest
effects
of
art
can
easily
produce
a
resounding
of
the
long
silent
even
broken
metaphysical
string
it
may
be
for
instance
that
at
a
passage
in
beethoven
ninth
symphony
he
feels
himself
floating
above
the
earth
in
a
starry
dome
with
the
dream
of
in
his
heart
all
the
stars
seem
to
shine
round
him
and
the
earth
to
sink
farther
and
farther
if
he
becomes
conscious
of
this
state
he
feels
a
deep
pain
at
his
heart
and
sighs
for
the
man
who
will
lead
back
to
him
his
lost
darling
be
it
called
religion
or
metaphysics
in
such
moments
his
intellectual
character
is
put
to
the
test
playing
with
the
lightness
and
frivolity
of
the
homeric
imagination
was
necessary
to
calm
and
occasionally
to
raise
the
immoderately
passionate
temperament
and
acute
intellect
of
the
greeks
if
their
intellect
speaks
how
harsh
and
cruel
does
life
then
appear
they
do
not
deceive
themselves
but
they
intentionally
weave
lies
round
life
simonides
advised
his
countrymen
to
look
upon
life
as
a
game
earnestness
was
too
to
them
as
pain
the
gods
so
gladly
hear
the
misery
of
mankind
made
the
theme
of
song
and
they
knew
that
through
art
alone
misery
might
be
turned
into
pleasure
as
a
punishment
for
this
insight
however
they
were
so
plagued
with
the
love
of
romancing
that
it
was
difficult
for
them
in
everyday
life
to
keep
themselves
free
from
falsehood
and
deceit
for
all
poetic
nations
have
such
a
love
of
falsehood
and
yet
are
innocent
withal
probably
this
occasionally
drove
the
neighbouring
nations
to
desperation
the
belief
in
it
is
to
the
interest
of
the
artist
that
there
should
be
a
belief
in
sudden
suggestions
inspirations
as
if
the
idea
of
a
work
of
art
of
poetry
the
fundamental
thought
of
a
philosophy
shone
down
from
heaven
like
a
ray
of
grace
in
reality
the
imagination
of
the
good
artist
or
thinker
constantly
produces
good
mediocre
and
bad
but
his
most
clear
and
practised
rejects
and
chooses
and
joins
together
just
as
we
now
learn
from
beethoven
notebooks
that
he
gradually
composed
the
most
beautiful
melodies
and
in
a
manner
selected
them
from
many
different
attempts
he
who
makes
less
severe
distinctions
and
willingly
abandons
himself
to
imitative
memories
may
under
certain
circumstances
become
a
great
improvisatore
but
artistic
improvisation
ranks
low
in
comparison
with
serious
and
laboriously
chosen
artistic
thoughts
all
great
men
were
great
workers
unwearied
not
only
in
invention
but
also
in
rejection
reviewing
transforming
and
arranging
inspiration
if
the
productive
power
has
been
suspended
for
a
length
of
time
and
has
been
hindered
in
its
outflow
by
some
obstacle
there
comes
at
last
such
a
sudden
as
if
an
immediate
inspiration
were
taking
place
without
previous
inward
working
consequently
a
miracle
this
constitutes
the
familiar
deception
in
the
continuance
of
which
as
we
have
said
the
interest
of
all
artists
is
rather
too
much
concerned
the
capital
has
only
it
has
not
suddenly
fallen
down
from
heaven
moreover
such
apparent
inspirations
are
seen
elsewhere
for
instance
in
the
realm
of
goodness
of
virtue
and
of
vice
the
suffering
of
genius
and
its
the
artistic
genius
desires
to
give
pleasure
but
if
his
mind
is
on
a
very
high
plane
he
does
not
easily
find
any
one
to
share
his
pleasure
he
offers
entertainment
but
nobody
accepts
it
this
gives
him
in
certain
circumstances
a
comically
touching
pathos
for
he
has
really
no
right
to
force
pleasure
on
men
he
pipes
but
none
will
dance
can
that
be
tragic
as
compensation
for
this
deprivation
however
he
finds
more
pleasure
in
creating
than
the
rest
of
mankind
experiences
in
all
other
species
of
activity
his
sufferings
are
considered
as
exaggerated
because
the
sound
of
his
complaints
is
louder
and
his
tongue
more
eloquent
and
yet
his
sufferings
are
really
very
great
but
only
because
his
ambition
and
his
envy
are
so
great
the
learned
genius
like
kepler
and
spinoza
is
usually
not
so
covetous
and
does
not
make
such
an
exhibition
of
his
really
greater
sufferings
and
deprivations
he
can
reckon
with
greater
certainty
on
future
fame
and
can
afford
to
do
without
the
present
whilst
an
artist
who
does
this
always
plays
a
desperate
game
that
makes
his
heart
ache
in
very
rare
cases
when
in
one
and
the
same
individual
are
combined
the
genius
of
power
and
of
knowledge
and
the
moral
genius
there
is
added
to
the
pains
that
species
of
pain
which
must
be
regarded
as
the
most
curious
exception
in
the
world
those
and
sensations
which
are
experienced
on
behalf
of
a
nation
of
humanity
of
all
civilisation
all
suffering
existence
which
acquire
their
value
through
the
connection
with
particularly
difficult
and
remote
perceptions
pity
in
itself
is
worth
but
little
but
what
standard
what
proof
is
there
for
its
genuineness
is
it
not
almost
imperative
to
be
mistrustful
of
all
who
of
feeling
sensations
of
this
kind
the
destiny
of
every
great
phenomenon
is
followed
by
degeneration
especially
in
the
world
of
art
the
example
of
the
great
tempts
vainer
natures
to
superficial
imitation
or
exaggeration
all
great
gifts
have
the
fatality
of
crushing
many
weaker
forces
and
germs
and
of
laying
waste
all
nature
around
them
the
happiest
arrangement
in
the
development
of
an
art
is
for
several
geniuses
mutually
to
hold
one
another
within
bounds
in
this
strife
it
generally
happens
that
light
and
air
are
also
granted
to
the
weaker
and
more
delicate
natures
art
dangerous
for
the
when
art
takes
strong
hold
of
an
individual
it
draws
him
back
to
the
contemplation
of
those
times
when
art
flourished
best
and
it
has
then
a
retrograde
effect
the
artist
grows
more
and
more
to
reverence
sudden
inspirations
he
believes
in
gods
and
dæmons
he
spiritualises
all
nature
hates
science
is
changeable
in
his
moods
like
the
ancients
and
longs
for
an
overthrow
of
all
existing
conditions
which
are
not
favourable
to
art
and
does
this
with
the
impetuosity
and
unreasonableness
of
a
child
now
in
himself
the
artist
is
already
a
backward
nature
because
he
halts
at
a
game
that
belongs
properly
to
youth
and
childhood
to
this
is
added
the
fact
that
he
is
educated
back
into
former
times
thus
there
gradually
arises
a
fierce
antagonism
between
him
and
his
contemporaries
and
a
sad
ending
according
to
the
accounts
of
the
ancients
homer
and
æschylus
spent
their
last
years
and
died
in
melancholy
created
when
it
is
said
that
the
dramatist
and
the
artist
above
all
real
characters
it
is
a
fine
deception
and
exaggeration
in
the
existence
and
propagation
of
which
art
celebrates
one
of
its
unconscious
but
at
the
same
time
abundant
triumphs
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
not
understand
much
about
a
real
living
man
and
we
generalise
very
superficially
when
we
ascribe
to
him
this
and
that
character
this
attitude
of
ours
towards
man
is
represented
by
the
poet
inasmuch
as
he
makes
into
men
in
this
sense
creates
outlines
as
as
our
knowledge
of
man
is
superficial
there
is
a
great
deal
of
delusion
about
these
created
characters
of
artists
they
are
by
no
means
living
productions
of
nature
but
are
like
painted
men
somewhat
too
thin
they
will
not
bear
a
close
inspection
and
when
it
is
said
that
the
character
of
the
ordinary
living
being
contradicts
itself
frequently
and
that
the
one
created
by
the
dramatist
is
the
original
model
conceived
by
nature
this
is
quite
wrong
a
genuine
man
is
something
absolutely
even
in
those
contradictions
but
we
do
not
always
recognise
this
necessity
the
imaginary
man
the
phantasm
signifies
something
necessary
but
only
to
those
who
understand
a
real
man
only
in
a
crude
unnatural
simplification
so
that
a
few
strong
traits
with
a
great
deal
of
light
and
shade
and
about
them
amply
satisfy
their
notions
they
are
therefore
ready
to
treat
the
phantasm
as
a
genuine
necessary
man
because
with
real
men
they
are
accustomed
to
regard
a
phantasm
an
outline
an
intentional
abbreviation
as
the
whole
that
the
painter
and
the
sculptor
express
the
idea
of
man
is
a
vain
imagination
and
delusion
whoever
says
this
is
in
subjection
to
the
eye
for
this
only
sees
the
surface
the
epidermis
of
the
human
body
the
inward
body
however
is
equally
a
part
of
the
idea
plastic
art
wishes
to
make
character
visible
on
the
surface
histrionic
art
employs
speech
for
the
same
purpose
it
reflects
character
in
sounds
art
starts
from
the
natural
of
man
about
his
interior
condition
in
body
and
character
it
is
not
meant
for
philosophers
or
natural
scientists
the
of
self
in
the
belief
in
artists
and
we
are
all
prone
to
think
that
the
excellence
of
a
work
of
art
or
of
an
artist
is
proved
when
it
moves
and
touches
us
but
there
own
in
judgment
and
sensibility
must
have
been
proved
first
which
is
not
the
case
in
all
plastic
art
who
had
greater
power
to
effect
a
charm
than
bernini
who
made
a
greater
effect
than
the
orator
that
appeared
after
demosthenes
introduced
the
asiatic
style
and
gave
it
a
predominance
which
lasted
throughout
two
centuries
this
predominance
during
whole
centuries
is
not
a
proof
of
the
excellence
and
enduring
validity
of
a
style
therefore
we
must
not
be
too
certain
in
our
good
opinion
of
any
artist
this
is
not
only
belief
in
the
truthfulness
of
our
sensations
but
also
in
the
infallibility
of
our
judgment
whereas
judgment
or
sensation
or
even
both
may
be
too
coarse
or
too
fine
exaggerated
or
crude
neither
are
the
blessings
and
blissfulness
of
a
philosophy
or
of
a
religion
proofs
of
its
truth
just
as
little
as
the
happiness
which
an
insane
person
derives
from
his
fixed
idea
is
a
proof
of
the
reasonableness
of
this
idea
the
cult
of
genius
for
the
sake
of
because
we
think
well
of
ourselves
but
nevertheless
do
not
imagine
that
we
are
capable
of
the
conception
of
one
of
raphael
pictures
or
of
a
scene
such
as
those
of
one
of
shakespeare
dramas
we
persuade
ourselves
that
the
faculty
for
doing
this
is
quite
extraordinarily
wonderful
a
very
rare
case
or
if
we
are
religiously
inclined
a
grace
from
above
thus
the
cult
of
genius
fosters
our
vanity
our
for
it
is
only
when
we
think
of
it
as
very
far
removed
from
us
as
a
that
it
does
not
wound
us
even
goethe
who
was
free
from
envy
called
shakespeare
a
star
of
the
farthest
heavens
whereby
we
are
reminded
of
the
line
die
sterne
die
begehrt
man
nicht
but
apart
from
those
suggestions
of
our
vanity
the
activity
of
a
genius
does
not
seem
so
radically
different
from
the
activity
of
a
mechanical
inventor
of
an
astronomer
or
historian
or
strategist
all
these
forms
of
activity
are
explicable
if
we
realise
men
whose
minds
are
active
in
one
special
direction
who
make
use
of
everything
as
material
who
always
eagerly
study
their
own
inward
life
and
that
of
others
who
find
types
and
incitements
everywhere
who
never
weary
in
the
employment
of
their
means
genius
does
nothing
but
learn
how
to
lay
stones
then
to
build
always
to
seek
for
material
and
always
to
work
upon
it
every
human
activity
is
marvellously
complicated
and
not
only
that
of
genius
but
it
is
no
miracle
now
whence
comes
the
belief
that
genius
is
found
only
in
artists
orators
and
philosophers
that
they
alone
have
intuition
by
which
we
credit
them
with
a
kind
of
magic
glass
by
means
of
which
they
see
straight
into
one
being
it
is
clear
that
men
only
speak
of
genius
where
the
workings
of
a
great
intellect
are
most
agreeable
to
them
and
they
have
no
desire
to
feel
envious
to
call
any
one
divine
is
as
much
as
saying
here
we
have
no
occasion
for
rivalry
thus
it
is
that
everything
completed
and
perfect
is
stared
at
and
everything
incomplete
is
undervalued
now
nobody
can
see
how
the
work
of
an
artist
has
that
is
its
advantage
for
everything
of
which
the
development
is
seen
is
looked
on
coldly
the
perfected
art
of
representation
precludes
all
thought
of
its
development
it
tyrannises
as
present
perfection
for
this
reason
artists
of
representation
are
especially
held
to
be
possess
of
genius
but
not
scientific
men
in
reality
however
the
former
valuation
and
the
latter
are
only
puerilities
of
reason
the
earnestness
of
do
not
talk
of
gifts
of
inborn
talents
we
could
mention
great
men
of
all
kinds
who
were
but
little
gifted
but
they
greatness
became
geniuses
as
they
are
called
through
qualities
of
the
lack
of
which
nobody
who
is
conscious
of
them
likes
to
speak
they
all
had
that
thorough
earnestness
for
work
which
learns
first
how
to
form
the
different
parts
perfectly
before
it
ventures
to
make
a
great
whole
they
gave
themselves
time
for
this
because
they
took
more
pleasure
in
doing
small
accessory
things
well
than
in
the
effect
of
a
dazzling
whole
for
instance
the
recipe
for
becoming
a
good
novelist
is
easily
given
but
the
carrying
out
of
the
recipe
presupposes
qualities
which
we
are
in
the
habit
of
overlooking
when
we
say
i
have
not
sufficient
talent
make
a
hundred
or
more
sketches
of
none
more
than
two
pages
long
but
of
such
clearness
that
every
word
in
them
is
necessary
write
down
anecdotes
every
day
until
you
learn
to
find
the
most
pregnant
most
effective
form
never
weary
of
collecting
and
delineating
human
types
and
characters
above
all
narrate
things
as
often
as
possible
and
listen
to
narrations
with
a
sharp
eye
and
ear
for
the
effect
upon
other
people
present
travel
like
a
landscape
painter
and
a
designer
of
costumes
take
from
different
sciences
everything
that
is
artistically
effective
if
it
be
well
represented
finally
meditate
on
the
motives
for
human
actions
scorn
not
even
the
smallest
point
of
instruction
on
this
subject
and
collect
similar
matters
by
day
and
night
spend
some
ten
years
in
these
various
exercises
then
the
creations
of
your
study
may
be
allowed
to
see
the
light
of
day
but
what
do
most
people
do
on
the
contrary
they
do
not
begin
with
the
part
but
with
the
whole
perhaps
they
make
one
good
stroke
excite
attention
and
ever
afterwards
their
work
grows
worse
and
worse
for
good
natural
reasons
but
sometimes
when
intellect
and
character
are
lacking
for
the
formation
of
such
an
artistic
career
fate
and
necessity
take
the
place
of
these
qualities
and
lead
the
future
master
step
by
step
through
all
the
phases
of
his
craft
the
danger
and
the
gain
in
the
cult
of
the
belief
in
great
superior
fertile
minds
is
not
necessarily
but
still
very
frequently
connected
with
that
wholly
or
partly
religious
superstition
that
those
spirits
are
of
superhuman
origin
and
possess
certain
marvellous
faculties
by
means
of
which
they
obtained
their
knowledge
in
ways
quite
different
from
the
rest
of
mankind
they
are
credited
with
having
an
immediate
insight
into
the
nature
of
the
world
through
a
in
the
mantle
of
the
phenomenon
as
it
were
and
it
is
believed
that
without
the
trouble
and
severity
of
science
by
virtue
of
this
marvellous
prophetic
sight
they
could
impart
something
final
and
decisive
about
mankind
and
the
world
so
long
as
there
are
still
believers
in
miracles
in
the
world
of
knowledge
it
may
perhaps
be
admitted
that
the
believers
themselves
derive
a
benefit
therefrom
inasmuch
as
by
their
absolute
subjection
to
great
minds
they
obtain
the
best
discipline
and
schooling
for
their
own
minds
during
the
period
of
development
on
the
other
hand
it
may
at
least
be
questioned
whether
the
superstition
of
genius
of
its
privileges
and
special
faculties
is
useful
for
a
genius
himself
when
it
implants
itself
in
him
in
any
case
it
is
a
dangerous
sign
when
man
shudders
at
his
own
self
be
it
that
famous
cæsarian
shudder
or
the
shudder
of
genius
which
applies
to
this
case
when
the
incense
of
sacrifice
which
by
rights
is
offered
to
a
god
alone
penetrates
into
the
brain
of
the
genius
so
that
he
begins
to
waver
and
to
look
upon
himself
as
something
superhuman
the
slow
consequences
are
the
feeling
of
irresponsibility
the
exceptional
rights
the
belief
that
mere
intercourse
with
him
confers
a
favour
and
frantic
rage
at
any
attempt
to
compare
him
with
others
or
even
to
place
him
below
them
and
to
bring
into
prominence
whatever
is
unsuccessful
in
his
work
through
the
fact
that
he
ceases
to
criticise
himself
one
pinion
after
another
falls
out
of
his
plumage
that
superstition
undermines
the
foundation
of
his
strength
and
even
makes
him
a
hypocrite
after
his
power
has
failed
him
for
great
minds
it
is
therefore
perhaps
better
when
they
come
to
an
understanding
about
their
strength
and
its
source
when
they
comprehend
what
purely
human
qualities
are
mingled
in
them
what
a
combination
they
are
of
fortunate
conditions
thus
once
it
was
continual
energy
a
decided
application
to
individual
aims
great
personal
courage
and
then
the
good
fortune
of
an
education
which
at
an
early
period
provided
the
best
teachers
examples
and
methods
assuredly
if
its
aim
is
to
make
the
greatest
possible
abstruseness
has
always
done
much
for
itself
and
that
gift
of
partial
insanity
for
at
all
times
that
power
has
been
admired
and
envied
by
means
of
which
men
were
deprived
of
will
and
imbued
with
the
fancy
that
they
were
preceded
by
supernatural
leaders
truly
men
are
exalted
and
inspired
by
the
belief
that
some
one
among
them
is
endowed
with
supernatural
powers
and
in
this
respect
insanity
as
plato
says
has
brought
the
greatest
blessings
to
mankind
in
a
few
rare
cases
this
form
of
insanity
may
also
have
been
the
means
by
which
an
exuberant
nature
was
kept
within
bounds
in
individual
life
the
imaginings
of
frenzy
frequently
exert
the
virtue
of
remedies
which
are
poisons
in
themselves
but
in
every
genius
that
believes
in
his
own
divinity
the
poison
shows
itself
at
last
in
the
same
proportion
as
the
genius
grows
old
we
need
but
recollect
the
example
of
napoleon
for
it
was
most
assuredly
through
his
faith
in
himself
and
his
star
and
through
his
scorn
of
mankind
that
he
grew
to
that
mighty
unity
which
distinguished
him
from
all
modern
men
until
at
last
however
this
faith
developed
into
an
almost
insane
fatalism
robbed
him
of
his
quickness
of
comprehension
and
penetration
and
was
the
cause
of
his
downfall
genius
and
it
is
precisely
the
artists
those
who
create
out
of
their
own
heads
who
in
certain
circumstances
can
bring
forth
complete
and
husk
whilst
the
more
dependent
natures
the
talented
ones
are
full
of
memories
of
all
manner
of
goodness
and
even
in
a
state
of
weakness
produce
something
tolerable
but
if
the
original
ones
are
abandoned
by
themselves
memory
renders
them
no
assistance
they
become
empty
the
the
people
really
demands
nothing
more
from
tragedy
than
to
be
deeply
affected
in
order
to
have
a
good
cry
occasionally
the
artist
on
the
contrary
who
sees
the
new
tragedy
takes
pleasure
in
the
clever
technical
inventions
and
tricks
in
the
management
and
distribution
of
the
material
in
the
novel
arrangement
of
old
motives
and
old
ideas
his
attitude
is
the
æsthetic
attitude
towards
a
work
of
art
that
of
the
creator
the
one
first
described
with
regard
solely
to
the
material
is
that
of
he
people
of
the
individual
who
stands
between
the
two
nothing
need
be
said
he
is
neither
people
nor
artist
and
does
not
know
what
he
wants
therefore
his
pleasure
is
also
clouded
and
insignificant
the
artistic
education
of
the
if
the
same
is
not
employed
in
a
hundred
ways
by
different
masters
the
public
never
learns
to
get
beyond
their
interest
in
the
subject
but
at
last
when
it
is
well
acquainted
with
the
through
countless
different
treatments
and
no
longer
finds
in
it
any
charm
of
novelty
or
excitement
it
will
then
begin
to
grasp
and
enjoy
the
various
shades
and
delicate
new
inventions
in
its
treatment
the
artist
and
his
followers
must
keep
in
the
progress
from
one
grade
of
style
to
another
must
be
so
slow
that
not
only
the
artists
but
also
the
auditors
and
spectators
can
follow
it
and
know
exactly
what
is
going
on
otherwise
there
will
suddenly
appear
that
great
chasm
between
the
artist
who
creates
his
work
upon
a
height
apart
and
the
public
who
can
not
rise
up
to
that
height
and
finally
sinks
discontentedly
deeper
for
when
the
artist
no
longer
raises
his
public
it
rapidly
sinks
downwards
and
its
fall
is
the
deeper
and
more
dangerous
in
proportion
to
the
height
to
which
genius
has
carried
it
like
the
eagle
out
of
whose
talons
a
tortoise
that
has
been
borne
up
into
the
clouds
falls
to
its
destruction
the
source
of
the
comic
if
we
consider
that
for
many
thousands
of
years
man
was
an
animal
that
was
susceptible
in
the
highest
degree
to
fear
and
that
everything
sudden
and
unexpected
had
to
find
him
ready
for
battle
perhaps
even
ready
for
death
that
even
later
in
social
relations
all
security
was
based
on
the
expected
on
custom
in
thought
and
action
we
need
not
be
surprised
that
at
everything
sudden
and
unexpected
in
word
and
deed
if
it
occurs
without
danger
or
injury
man
becomes
exuberant
and
passes
over
into
the
very
opposite
of
fear
the
terrified
trembling
crouching
being
shoots
upward
stretches
itself
man
laughs
this
transition
from
momentary
fear
into
exhilaration
is
called
the
on
the
other
hand
in
the
tragic
phenomenon
man
passes
quickly
from
great
enduring
exuberance
into
great
fear
but
as
amongst
mortals
great
and
lasting
exuberance
is
much
rarer
than
the
cause
for
fear
there
is
far
more
comedy
than
tragedy
in
the
world
we
laugh
much
offener
than
we
are
agitated
the
artist
the
greek
artists
the
tragedians
for
instance
composed
in
order
to
conquer
their
whole
art
can
not
be
imagined
without
rivalry
the
good
hesiodian
eris
ambition
gave
wings
to
their
genius
this
ambition
further
demanded
that
their
work
should
achieve
the
greatest
excellence
their
own
eyes
as
they
understood
excellence
any
for
the
reigning
taste
and
the
general
opinion
about
excellence
in
a
work
of
art
and
thus
it
was
long
before
æschylus
and
euripides
achieved
any
success
until
at
last
they
judges
of
art
who
valued
their
work
according
to
the
standards
which
they
themselves
appointed
hence
they
strove
for
victory
over
rivals
according
to
their
own
valuation
they
really
wished
to
more
excellent
they
demanded
assent
from
without
to
this
the
confirmation
of
this
verdict
to
achieve
honour
means
in
this
case
to
make
one
self
superior
to
others
and
to
desire
that
this
should
be
recognised
publicly
should
the
former
condition
be
wanting
and
the
latter
nevertheless
desired
it
is
then
called
should
the
latter
be
lacking
and
not
missed
then
it
is
named
what
is
needful
to
a
work
of
those
who
talk
so
much
about
the
needful
factors
of
a
work
of
art
exaggerate
if
they
are
artists
they
do
so
majorem
artis
gloriam
if
they
are
laymen
from
ignorance
the
form
of
a
work
of
art
which
gives
speech
to
their
thoughts
and
is
therefore
their
mode
of
talking
is
always
somewhat
uncertain
like
all
kinds
of
speech
the
sculptor
can
add
or
omit
many
little
traits
as
can
also
the
exponent
be
he
an
actor
or
in
music
a
performer
or
conductor
these
many
little
traits
and
finishing
touches
afford
him
pleasure
one
day
and
none
the
next
they
exist
more
for
the
sake
of
the
artist
than
the
art
for
he
also
has
occasionally
need
of
sweetmeats
and
playthings
to
prevent
him
from
becoming
morose
with
the
severity
and
which
the
representation
of
the
dominant
idea
demands
from
him
to
cause
the
master
to
be
the
pianoforte
player
who
executes
the
work
of
a
master
will
have
played
best
if
he
has
made
his
audience
forget
the
master
and
if
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
relating
a
story
from
his
own
life
or
just
passing
through
some
experience
assuredly
if
he
is
of
no
importance
every
one
will
abhor
the
garrulity
with
which
he
talks
about
his
own
life
therefore
he
must
know
how
to
influence
his
hearer
imagination
favourably
towards
himself
hereby
are
explained
all
the
weaknesses
and
follies
of
the
virtuoso
la
there
are
unfortunate
accidents
in
the
lives
of
great
artists
which
compel
the
painter
for
instance
to
sketch
out
his
most
important
picture
only
as
a
passing
thought
or
such
as
obliged
beethoven
to
leave
behind
him
only
the
insufficient
pianoforte
score
of
many
great
sonatas
as
in
the
great
b
flat
in
these
cases
the
artist
of
a
later
day
must
endeavour
to
fill
out
the
life
of
the
great
man
of
all
orchestral
effects
would
call
into
life
that
symphony
which
has
fallen
into
the
many
things
events
or
persons
can
not
bear
treatment
on
a
small
scale
the
laocoon
group
can
not
be
reduced
to
a
great
size
is
necessary
to
it
but
more
seldom
still
does
anything
that
is
naturally
small
bear
enlargement
for
which
reason
biographers
succeed
far
oftener
in
representing
a
great
man
as
small
than
a
small
one
as
great
sensuousness
in
artists
nowadays
frequently
miscalculate
when
they
count
on
the
sensuous
effect
of
their
works
for
their
spectators
or
hearers
have
no
longer
a
fully
sensuous
nature
and
quite
contrary
to
the
artist
intention
his
work
produces
in
them
a
holiness
of
feeling
which
is
closely
related
to
boredom
their
sensuousness
begins
perhaps
just
where
that
of
the
artist
ceases
they
meet
therefore
only
at
one
point
at
the
most
shakespeare
as
a
shakespeare
meditated
much
on
the
passions
and
on
account
of
his
temperament
had
probably
a
close
acquaintance
with
many
of
them
dramatists
are
in
general
rather
wicked
men
he
could
however
not
talk
on
the
subject
like
montaigne
but
put
his
observations
thereon
into
the
mouths
of
impassioned
figures
which
is
contrary
to
nature
certainly
but
makes
his
dramas
so
rich
in
thought
that
they
cause
all
others
to
seem
poor
in
comparison
and
readily
arouse
a
general
aversion
to
them
schiller
reflections
which
are
almost
always
based
on
erroneous
or
trivial
fancies
are
just
theatrical
reflections
and
as
such
are
very
effective
whereas
shakespeare
reflections
do
honour
to
his
model
montaigne
and
contain
quite
serious
thoughts
in
polished
form
but
on
that
account
are
too
remote
and
refined
for
the
eyes
of
the
theatrical
public
and
are
consequently
ineffective
securing
a
good
it
is
not
sufficient
to
know
how
to
play
well
one
must
also
know
how
to
secure
a
good
hearing
a
violin
in
the
hand
of
the
greatest
master
gives
only
a
little
squeak
when
the
place
where
it
is
heard
is
too
large
the
master
may
then
be
mistaken
for
any
bungler
the
incomplete
as
the
just
as
figures
in
relief
make
such
a
strong
impression
on
the
imagination
because
they
seem
in
the
act
of
emerging
from
the
wall
and
only
stopped
by
some
sudden
hindrance
so
the
incomplete
representation
of
a
thought
or
a
whole
philosophy
is
sometimes
more
effective
than
its
exhaustive
amplification
more
is
left
for
the
investigation
of
the
onlooker
he
is
incited
to
the
further
study
of
that
which
stands
out
before
him
in
such
strong
light
and
shade
he
is
prompted
to
think
out
the
subject
and
even
to
overcome
the
hindrance
which
hitherto
prevented
it
from
emerging
clearly
against
the
when
art
arrays
itself
in
the
most
shabby
material
it
is
most
easily
recognised
as
art
collective
a
good
author
possesses
not
only
his
own
intellect
but
also
that
of
his
friends
different
kinds
of
the
misfortune
of
acute
and
clear
authors
is
that
people
consider
them
as
shallow
and
therefore
do
not
devote
any
effort
to
them
and
the
good
fortune
of
obscure
writers
is
that
the
reader
makes
an
effort
to
understand
them
and
places
the
delight
in
his
own
zeal
to
their
credit
relation
to
none
of
the
people
have
any
real
interest
in
a
science
who
only
begin
to
be
enthusiastic
about
it
when
they
themselves
lave
made
discoveries
in
it
the
the
single
thought
on
which
an
eminent
man
sets
a
great
value
arousing
the
derision
and
laughter
of
the
masses
is
for
him
a
key
to
hidden
treasures
for
them
however
it
is
nothing
than
a
piece
of
old
iron
it
is
neither
the
best
nor
the
worst
parts
of
a
book
which
are
untranslatable
authors
the
paradoxes
of
an
author
to
which
a
reader
objects
are
often
not
in
the
author
book
at
all
but
in
the
reader
head
the
wittiest
authors
produce
a
scarcely
noticeable
smile
antithesis
is
the
narrow
gate
through
which
error
is
fondest
of
sneaking
to
the
truth
thinkers
as
most
thinkers
write
badly
because
they
communicate
not
only
their
thoughts
but
also
the
thinking
of
them
thoughts
in
the
poet
conveys
his
thoughts
ceremoniously
in
the
vehicle
of
rhythm
usually
because
they
are
not
able
to
go
on
foot
the
sin
against
the
reader
when
an
author
renounces
his
talent
in
order
merely
to
put
himself
on
a
level
with
the
reader
he
commits
the
only
deadly
sin
which
the
latter
will
never
forgive
should
he
notice
anything
of
it
one
may
say
everything
that
is
bad
about
a
person
but
in
the
manner
it
is
said
one
must
know
how
to
revive
his
vanity
anew
the
limits
of
even
the
most
upright
author
lets
fall
a
word
too
much
when
he
wishes
to
round
off
a
period
the
best
author
the
best
author
will
be
he
who
is
ashamed
to
become
one
draconian
law
against
one
should
regard
authors
as
criminals
who
only
obtain
acquittal
or
mercy
in
the
rarest
cases
that
would
be
a
remedy
for
books
becoming
too
rife
the
fools
of
modern
the
fools
of
mediæval
courts
correspond
to
our
writers
they
are
the
same
kind
of
men
witty
extravagant
foolish
sometimes
there
only
for
the
purpose
of
lessening
the
pathos
of
the
outlook
with
fancies
and
chatter
and
of
drowning
with
their
clamour
the
far
too
deep
and
solemn
chimes
of
great
events
they
were
formerly
in
the
service
of
princes
and
nobles
now
they
are
in
the
service
of
parties
since
a
large
portion
of
the
old
obsequiousness
in
the
intercourse
of
the
people
with
their
prince
still
survives
in
and
modern
literary
men
however
are
generally
very
similar
to
the
writers
they
are
the
fools
of
modern
culture
whom
one
judges
more
leniently
when
one
does
not
regard
them
as
fully
responsible
beings
to
look
upon
writing
as
a
regular
profession
should
justly
be
regarded
as
a
form
of
madness
after
the
example
of
the
it
is
a
great
hindrance
to
knowledge
at
present
that
owing
to
centuries
of
exaggeration
of
feeling
all
words
have
become
vague
and
inflated
the
higher
stage
of
culture
which
is
under
the
sway
though
not
under
the
tyranny
of
knowledge
requires
great
sobriety
of
feeling
and
thorough
concentration
of
words
on
which
points
the
greeks
in
the
time
of
demosthenes
set
an
example
to
us
exaggeration
is
a
distinguishing
mark
of
all
modern
writings
and
even
when
they
are
simply
written
the
expressions
therein
are
still
as
eccentric
careful
reflection
conciseness
coldness
plainness
even
carried
intentionally
to
the
farthest
limits
in
a
word
suppression
of
feeling
and
taciturnity
these
are
the
only
remedies
for
the
rest
this
cold
manner
of
writing
and
feeling
is
now
very
attractive
as
a
contrast
and
to
be
sure
there
is
a
new
danger
therein
for
intense
cold
is
as
good
a
stimulus
as
a
high
degree
of
warmth
good
narrators
bad
in
good
narrators
there
is
often
found
an
admirable
psychological
sureness
and
logicalness
as
far
as
these
qualities
can
be
observed
in
the
actions
of
their
personages
in
positively
ludicrous
contrast
to
their
inexperienced
psychological
reasoning
so
that
their
culture
appears
to
be
as
extraordinarily
high
one
moment
as
it
seems
regrettably
defective
the
next
it
happens
far
too
frequently
that
they
give
an
evidently
false
explanation
of
their
own
heroes
and
their
actions
of
this
there
is
no
doubt
however
improbable
the
thing
may
appear
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
greatest
pianoforte
player
has
thought
but
little
about
the
technical
conditions
and
the
special
virtues
drawbacks
usefulness
and
tractability
of
each
finger
dactylic
ethics
and
makes
big
mistakes
whenever
he
speaks
of
such
things
the
writings
of
acquaintances
and
their
we
read
the
writings
of
our
acquaintances
friends
and
enemies
in
a
double
sense
inasmuch
as
our
perception
constantly
whispers
that
is
something
of
himself
a
remembrance
of
his
inward
being
his
experiences
his
talents
and
at
the
same
time
another
kind
of
perception
endeavours
to
estimate
the
profit
of
the
work
in
itself
what
valuation
it
merits
apart
from
its
author
how
far
it
will
enrich
knowledge
these
two
manners
of
reading
and
estimating
interfere
with
each
other
as
may
naturally
be
supposed
and
a
conversation
with
a
friend
will
only
bear
good
fruit
of
knowledge
when
both
think
only
of
the
matter
under
consideration
and
forget
that
they
are
friends
rhythmical
good
writers
alter
the
rhythm
of
many
a
period
merely
because
they
do
not
credit
the
general
reader
with
the
ability
to
comprehend
the
measure
followed
by
the
period
in
its
first
version
thus
they
make
it
easier
for
the
reader
by
giving
the
preference
to
the
better
known
this
regard
for
the
rhythmical
incapacity
of
the
modern
reader
has
already
called
forth
many
a
sigh
for
much
has
been
sacrificed
to
it
does
not
the
same
thing
happen
to
good
musicians
the
incomplete
as
an
artistic
the
incomplete
is
often
more
effective
than
perfection
and
this
is
the
case
with
eulogies
to
effect
their
purpose
a
stimulating
incompleteness
is
necessary
as
an
irrational
element
which
calls
up
a
sea
before
the
imagination
and
like
a
mist
conceals
the
opposite
coast
the
limits
of
the
object
of
praise
if
the
merits
of
a
person
are
referred
to
and
described
at
length
and
in
detail
it
always
gives
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
these
are
his
only
merits
the
perfect
eulogist
takes
his
stand
above
the
person
praised
he
appears
to
him
therefore
complete
praise
has
a
weakening
effect
precautions
in
writing
and
whoever
has
once
written
and
has
been
seized
with
the
passion
for
writing
learns
from
almost
all
that
he
does
and
experiences
that
which
is
literally
communicable
he
thinks
no
longer
of
himself
but
of
the
author
and
his
public
he
desires
insight
into
things
but
not
for
his
own
use
he
who
teaches
is
mostly
incapable
of
doing
anything
for
his
own
good
he
is
always
thinking
of
the
good
of
his
scholars
and
all
knowledge
delights
him
only
in
so
far
as
he
is
able
to
teach
it
he
comes
at
last
to
regard
himself
as
a
medium
of
knowledge
and
above
all
as
a
means
thereto
so
that
he
has
lost
all
serious
consideration
for
himself
the
necessity
for
bad
there
will
always
be
a
need
of
bad
authors
for
they
meet
the
taste
of
readers
of
an
undeveloped
immature
age
these
have
their
requirements
as
well
as
mature
readers
if
human
life
were
of
greater
length
the
number
of
mature
individuals
would
be
greater
than
that
of
the
immature
or
at
least
equally
great
but
as
it
is
by
far
the
greater
number
die
too
young
there
are
always
many
more
undeveloped
intellects
with
bad
taste
these
demand
with
the
greater
impetuosity
of
youth
the
satisfaction
of
their
needs
and
they
on
having
bad
authors
too
near
and
too
the
reader
and
the
author
very
often
do
not
understand
each
other
because
the
author
knows
his
theme
too
well
and
finds
it
almost
slow
so
that
he
omits
the
examples
of
which
he
knows
hundreds
the
reader
however
is
interested
in
the
subject
and
is
liable
to
consider
it
as
badly
proved
if
examples
are
lacking
a
vanished
preparation
for
of
everything
that
was
practised
in
public
schools
the
thing
of
greatest
value
was
the
exercise
in
latin
style
this
was
an
exercise
in
art
whilst
all
other
occupations
aimed
only
at
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
it
is
a
barbarism
to
put
german
composition
before
it
for
there
is
no
typical
german
style
developed
by
public
oratory
but
if
there
is
a
desire
to
advance
practice
in
thought
by
means
of
german
composition
then
it
is
certainly
better
for
the
time
being
to
pay
no
attention
to
style
to
separate
the
practice
in
thought
therefore
from
the
practice
in
reproduction
the
latter
should
confine
itself
to
the
various
modes
of
presenting
a
given
subject
and
should
not
concern
itself
with
the
independent
finding
of
a
subject
the
mere
presentment
of
given
subject
was
the
task
of
the
latin
style
for
which
the
old
teachers
possessed
a
long
vanished
delicacy
of
ear
formerly
whoever
learned
to
write
well
in
a
modern
language
had
to
thank
this
practice
for
the
acquirement
now
we
are
obliged
to
go
to
school
to
the
older
french
writers
but
yet
more
he
obtained
an
idea
of
the
loftiness
and
difficulty
of
form
and
was
prepared
for
art
in
the
only
right
way
by
practice
darkness
and
side
by
authors
who
in
general
do
not
understand
how
to
express
their
thoughts
clearly
are
fond
of
choosing
in
detail
the
strongest
most
exaggerated
distinctions
and
superlatives
thereby
is
produced
an
effect
of
light
which
is
like
torchlight
in
intricate
forest
paths
literary
an
important
object
will
be
best
described
if
the
colours
for
the
painting
are
taken
out
of
the
object
itself
as
a
chemist
does
and
then
employed
like
an
artist
so
that
the
drawing
develops
from
the
outlines
and
transitions
of
the
colours
thus
the
painting
acquires
something
of
the
entrancing
natural
element
which
gives
such
importance
to
the
object
itself
books
which
teach
how
to
there
are
authors
who
by
representing
the
impossible
as
possible
and
by
talking
of
morality
and
cleverness
as
if
both
were
merely
moods
and
humours
assumed
at
will
produce
a
feeling
of
exuberant
freedom
as
if
man
stood
on
tiptoe
and
were
compelled
to
dance
from
sheer
inward
delight
unfinished
just
as
not
only
manhood
but
also
youth
and
childhood
have
a
value
se
and
are
not
to
be
looked
upon
merely
as
passages
and
bridges
so
also
unfinished
thoughts
have
their
value
for
this
reason
we
must
not
torment
a
poet
with
subtle
explanations
but
must
take
pleasure
in
the
uncertainty
of
his
horizon
as
if
the
way
to
further
thoughts
were
still
open
we
stand
on
the
threshold
we
wait
as
for
the
digging
up
of
a
treasure
it
is
as
if
a
well
of
profundity
were
about
to
be
discovered
the
poet
anticipates
something
of
the
thinker
pleasure
in
the
discovery
of
a
leading
thought
an
makes
us
covetous
so
that
we
give
chase
to
it
but
it
flutters
past
our
head
and
exhibits
the
loveliest
and
yet
it
escapes
us
the
book
grown
almost
into
a
human
every
author
is
surprised
anew
at
the
way
in
which
his
book
as
soon
as
he
has
sent
it
out
continues
to
live
a
life
of
its
own
it
seems
to
him
as
if
one
part
of
an
insect
had
been
cut
off
and
now
went
on
its
own
way
perhaps
he
forgets
it
almost
entirely
perhaps
he
rises
above
the
view
expressed
therein
perhaps
even
he
understands
it
no
longer
and
has
lost
that
impulse
upon
which
he
soared
at
the
time
he
conceived
the
book
meanwhile
it
seeks
its
readers
inflames
life
pleases
horrifies
inspires
new
works
becomes
the
soul
of
designs
and
actions
in
short
it
lives
like
a
creature
endowed
with
mind
and
soul
and
yet
is
no
human
being
the
happiest
fate
is
that
of
the
author
who
as
an
old
man
is
able
to
say
that
all
there
was
in
him
of
strengthening
exalting
enlightening
thoughts
and
feelings
still
lives
on
in
his
writings
and
that
he
himself
now
only
represents
the
gray
ashes
whilst
the
fire
has
been
kept
alive
and
spread
out
and
if
we
consider
that
every
human
action
not
only
a
book
is
in
some
way
or
other
the
cause
of
other
actions
decisions
and
thoughts
that
everything
that
happens
is
inseparably
connected
with
everything
that
is
going
to
happen
we
recognise
the
real
that
of
movement
that
which
has
once
moved
is
enclosed
and
immortalised
in
the
general
union
of
all
existence
like
an
insect
within
a
piece
of
amber
joy
in
old
the
thinker
as
likewise
the
artist
who
has
put
his
best
self
into
his
works
feels
an
almost
malicious
joy
when
he
sees
how
mind
and
body
are
being
slowly
damaged
and
destroyed
by
time
as
if
from
a
dark
corner
he
were
spying
a
thief
at
his
knowing
all
the
time
that
it
was
empty
and
his
treasures
in
safety
quiet
the
born
aristocrats
of
the
mind
are
not
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
their
creations
appear
and
fall
from
the
tree
on
some
quiet
autumn
evening
without
being
rashly
desired
instigated
or
pushed
aside
by
new
matter
the
unceasing
desire
to
create
is
vulgar
and
betrays
envy
jealousy
and
ambition
if
a
man
something
it
is
not
really
necessary
for
him
to
do
anything
and
yet
he
does
a
great
deal
there
is
a
human
species
higher
even
than
wie
productive
man
achilles
and
it
is
always
like
the
case
of
achilles
and
homer
the
one
the
experiences
and
sensations
the
other
them
a
genuine
author
only
puts
into
words
the
feelings
and
adventures
of
others
he
is
an
artist
and
divines
much
from
the
little
he
has
experienced
artists
are
by
no
means
creatures
of
great
passion
but
they
frequently
themselves
as
such
with
the
unconscious
feeling
that
their
depicted
passion
will
be
better
believed
in
if
their
own
life
gives
credence
to
their
experience
in
these
affairs
they
need
only
let
themselves
go
not
control
themselves
and
give
free
play
to
their
anger
and
their
desires
and
every
one
will
immediately
cry
out
how
passionate
he
is
but
the
deeply
stirring
passion
that
consumes
and
often
destroys
the
individual
is
another
matter
those
who
have
really
experienced
it
do
not
describe
it
in
dramas
harmonies
or
romances
artists
are
frequently
individuals
in
so
far
as
they
are
not
artists
but
that
is
a
different
thing
old
doubts
about
the
effect
of
should
pity
and
fear
really
be
unburdened
through
tragedy
as
aristotle
would
have
it
so
that
the
hearers
return
home
colder
and
quieter
should
really
make
us
less
fearful
and
superstitious
in
the
case
of
certain
physical
processes
in
the
satisfaction
of
love
for
instance
it
is
true
that
with
the
fulfilment
of
a
need
there
follows
an
alleviation
and
temporary
decrease
in
the
impulse
but
fear
and
pity
are
not
in
this
sense
the
needs
of
particular
organs
which
require
to
be
relieved
and
in
time
every
instinct
is
even
by
practice
in
its
satisfaction
in
spite
of
that
periodical
mitigation
it
might
be
possible
that
in
each
single
case
pity
and
fear
would
be
soothed
and
relieved
by
tragedy
nevertheless
they
might
on
the
whole
be
increased
by
tragic
influences
and
plato
would
be
right
in
saying
that
tragedy
makes
us
altogether
more
timid
and
susceptible
the
tragic
poet
himself
would
then
of
necessity
acquire
a
gloomy
and
fearful
view
of
the
world
and
a
yielding
irritable
tearful
soul
it
would
also
agree
with
plato
view
if
the
tragic
poets
and
likewise
the
entire
part
of
the
community
that
derived
particular
pleasure
from
them
degenerated
into
ever
greater
licentiousness
and
intemperance
but
what
right
indeed
has
our
age
to
give
an
answer
to
that
great
question
of
as
to
the
moral
influence
of
art
if
we
even
had
art
where
have
we
an
influence
of
an
pleasure
in
how
can
we
take
pleasure
in
nonsense
but
wherever
there
is
laughter
in
the
world
this
is
the
case
it
may
even
be
said
that
almost
everywhere
where
there
is
happiness
there
is
found
pleasure
in
nonsense
the
transformation
of
experience
into
its
opposite
of
the
suitable
into
the
unsuitable
the
obligatory
into
the
optional
but
in
such
a
manner
that
this
process
produces
no
injury
and
is
only
imagined
in
jest
is
a
pleasure
for
it
temporarily
liberates
us
from
the
yoke
of
the
obligatory
suitable
and
experienced
in
which
we
usually
find
our
pitiless
masters
we
play
and
laugh
when
the
expected
which
generally
causes
fear
and
expectancy
happens
without
bringing
any
injury
it
is
the
pleasure
felt
by
slaves
in
the
saturnalian
feasts
the
ennobling
of
through
the
fact
that
in
the
aphrodisiac
impulse
men
discerned
a
godhead
and
with
adoring
gratitude
felt
it
working
within
themselves
this
emotion
has
in
the
course
of
time
become
imbued
with
higher
conceptions
and
has
thereby
been
materially
ennobled
thus
certain
nations
by
virtue
of
this
art
of
idealisation
have
created
great
aids
to
culture
out
of
diseases
the
greeks
for
instance
who
in
earlier
centuries
suffered
from
great
nervous
epidemics
like
epilepsy
and
vitus
dance
and
developed
out
of
them
the
splendid
type
of
the
bacchante
the
greeks
however
enjoyed
an
astonishingly
high
degree
of
health
their
secret
was
to
revere
even
disease
as
a
god
if
it
only
possessed
music
by
and
for
itself
is
not
so
portentous
for
our
inward
nature
so
deeply
moving
that
it
ought
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
language
of
the
feelings
but
its
ancient
union
with
poetry
has
infused
so
much
symbolism
into
rhythmical
movement
into
loudness
and
softness
of
tone
that
we
now
it
speaks
directly
and
comes
the
inward
nature
dramatic
music
is
only
possible
when
the
art
of
harmony
has
acquired
an
immense
range
of
symbolical
means
through
song
opera
and
a
hundred
attempts
at
description
by
sound
absolute
music
is
either
form
se
in
rude
condition
of
music
when
playing
in
time
and
with
various
degrees
of
strength
gives
pleasure
or
the
symbolism
of
form
which
speaks
to
the
understanding
even
without
poetry
after
the
two
arts
were
joined
finally
together
after
long
development
and
the
musical
form
had
been
woven
about
with
threads
of
meaning
and
feeling
people
who
are
backward
in
musical
development
can
appreciate
a
piece
of
harmony
merely
as
execution
whilst
those
who
are
advanced
will
comprehend
it
symbolically
no
music
is
deep
and
full
of
meaning
in
itself
it
does
not
speak
of
will
of
the
that
could
be
imagined
by
the
intellect
only
in
an
age
which
had
conquered
for
musical
symbolism
the
entire
range
of
inner
life
it
was
the
intellect
itself
that
first
this
meaning
to
sound
just
as
it
also
gave
meaning
to
the
relation
between
lines
and
masses
in
architecture
but
which
in
itself
is
quite
foreign
to
mechanical
laws
gesture
and
older
than
speech
is
the
imitation
of
gestures
which
is
carried
on
unconsciously
and
which
in
the
general
repression
of
the
language
of
gesture
and
trained
control
of
the
muscles
is
still
so
great
that
we
can
not
look
at
a
face
moved
by
emotion
without
feeling
an
agitation
of
our
own
face
it
may
be
remarked
that
feigned
yawning
excites
real
yawning
in
any
one
who
sees
it
the
imitated
gesture
leads
the
one
who
imitates
back
to
the
sensation
it
expressed
in
the
face
or
body
of
the
one
imitated
thus
men
learned
to
understand
one
another
thus
the
child
still
learns
to
understand
the
mother
generally
speaking
painful
sensations
may
also
have
been
expressed
by
gestures
and
the
pain
which
caused
them
for
instance
tearing
the
hair
beating
the
breast
forcible
distortion
and
straining
of
the
muscles
of
the
face
on
the
other
hand
gestures
of
joy
were
themselves
joyful
and
lent
themselves
easily
to
the
communication
of
the
understanding
laughter
as
the
expression
of
the
feeling
when
being
tickled
serves
also
for
the
expression
of
other
pleasurable
sensations
as
soon
as
men
understood
each
other
by
gestures
there
could
be
established
a
of
gestures
i
mean
an
understanding
could
be
arrived
at
respecting
the
language
of
accents
so
that
first
and
gesture
to
which
it
was
symbolically
added
were
produced
and
later
on
the
accent
alone
in
former
times
there
happened
very
frequently
that
which
now
happens
in
the
development
of
music
especially
of
dramatic
music
while
music
without
explanatory
dance
and
pantomime
language
of
gesture
is
at
first
only
empty
sound
but
by
long
familiarity
with
that
combination
of
music
and
movement
the
ear
becomes
schooled
into
instant
interpretation
of
the
figures
of
sound
and
finally
attains
a
height
of
quick
understanding
where
it
has
no
longer
any
need
of
visible
movement
and
the
without
it
it
is
then
called
absolute
music
that
is
music
in
which
without
further
help
everything
is
symbolically
understood
the
spiritualising
of
higher
by
virtue
of
extraordinary
intellectual
exercise
through
the
of
the
new
music
our
ears
have
been
growing
more
intellectual
for
this
reason
we
can
now
endure
a
much
greater
volume
of
sound
much
more
noise
because
we
are
far
better
practised
in
listening
for
the
in
it
than
were
our
ancestors
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
our
senses
have
been
somewhat
blunted
because
they
immediately
look
for
the
sense
that
is
they
ask
what
it
means
and
not
what
it
is
such
a
blunting
betrays
itself
for
instance
in
the
absolute
dominion
of
the
temperature
of
sounds
for
ears
which
still
make
the
finer
distinctions
between
and
for
instance
are
now
amongst
the
exceptions
in
this
respect
our
ear
has
grown
coarser
and
then
the
ugly
side
of
the
world
the
one
originally
hostile
to
the
senses
has
been
conquered
for
music
its
power
has
been
immensely
widened
especially
in
the
expression
of
the
noble
the
terrible
and
the
mysterious
our
music
now
gives
utterance
to
things
which
had
formerly
no
tongue
in
the
same
way
certain
painters
have
rendered
the
eye
more
intellectual
and
have
gone
far
beyond
that
which
was
formerly
called
pleasure
in
colour
and
form
here
too
that
side
of
the
world
originally
considered
as
ugly
has
been
conquered
by
the
artistic
intellect
what
results
from
all
this
the
more
capable
of
thought
that
eye
and
ear
become
the
more
they
approach
the
limit
where
they
become
senseless
the
seat
of
pleasure
is
moved
into
the
brain
the
organs
of
the
senses
themselves
become
dulled
and
weak
the
symbolical
takes
more
and
more
the
place
of
the
actual
and
thus
we
arrive
at
barbarism
in
this
way
as
surely
as
in
any
other
in
the
meantime
we
may
say
the
world
is
uglier
than
ever
but
it
a
more
beautiful
world
than
has
ever
existed
but
the
more
the
of
meaning
is
dispersed
and
evaporated
the
rarer
become
those
who
perceive
it
and
the
remainder
halt
at
what
is
ugly
and
endeavour
to
enjoy
it
direct
an
aim
however
which
they
never
succeed
in
attaining
thus
in
germany
there
is
a
twofold
direction
of
musical
development
here
a
throng
of
ten
thousand
with
ever
higher
finer
demands
ever
listening
more
and
more
for
the
it
means
and
there
the
immense
countless
mass
which
yearly
grows
more
incapable
of
understanding
what
is
important
even
in
the
form
of
sensual
ugliness
and
which
therefore
turns
ever
more
willingly
to
what
in
music
is
ugly
and
foul
in
itself
that
is
to
the
basely
sensual
a
stone
is
more
of
a
stone
than
as
a
general
rule
we
no
longer
understand
architecture
at
least
by
no
means
in
the
same
way
as
we
understand
music
we
have
outgrown
the
symbolism
of
lines
and
figures
just
as
we
are
no
longer
accustomed
to
the
of
rhetoric
and
have
not
absorbed
this
kind
of
mother
milk
of
culture
since
our
first
moment
of
life
everything
in
a
greek
or
christian
building
originally
had
a
meaning
and
referred
to
a
higher
order
of
things
this
feeling
of
inexhaustible
meaning
enveloped
the
edifice
like
a
mystic
veil
beauty
was
only
a
secondary
consideration
in
the
system
without
in
any
way
materially
injuring
the
fundamental
sentiment
of
the
the
divinely
and
magically
consecrated
at
the
most
beauty
but
this
horror
was
everywhere
presupposed
what
is
the
beauty
of
a
building
now
the
same
thing
as
the
beautiful
face
of
a
stupid
woman
a
kind
of
mask
the
religious
source
of
the
newer
soulful
music
arose
out
of
the
catholicism
after
the
council
of
trent
through
palestrina
who
endowed
the
earnest
and
deeply
moved
spirit
with
sound
later
on
in
bach
it
appeared
also
in
protestantism
as
far
as
this
had
been
deepened
by
the
pietists
and
released
from
its
originally
dogmatic
character
the
supposition
and
necessary
preparation
for
both
origins
is
the
familiarity
with
music
which
existed
during
and
before
the
renaissance
namely
that
learned
occupation
with
music
which
was
really
scientific
pleasure
in
the
masterpieces
of
harmony
and
on
the
other
hand
the
opera
must
have
preceded
it
wherein
the
layman
made
his
protest
against
a
music
that
had
grown
too
learned
and
cold
and
endeavoured
to
polyhymnia
with
a
soul
without
the
change
to
that
deeply
religious
sentiment
without
the
dying
away
of
the
inwardly
moved
temperament
music
would
have
remained
learned
or
operatic
the
spirit
of
the
is
the
spirit
of
modern
music
for
that
pietism
in
bach
music
is
also
a
kind
of
so
deeply
are
we
indebted
to
the
religious
life
music
was
the
in
the
field
of
art
to
this
belongs
also
the
later
painting
of
the
caracci
and
caravaggi
perhaps
also
the
baroque
style
in
case
more
than
the
architecture
of
the
renaissance
or
of
antiquity
and
we
might
still
ask
if
our
newer
music
could
move
stones
would
it
build
them
up
into
antique
architecture
i
very
much
doubt
it
for
that
which
predominates
in
this
music
affections
pleasure
in
exalted
sentiments
the
desire
to
be
alive
at
any
cost
the
quick
change
of
feeling
the
strong
of
light
and
shade
the
combination
of
the
ecstatic
and
the
naïve
all
this
has
already
reigned
in
the
plastic
arts
and
created
new
laws
of
style
but
it
was
neither
in
the
time
of
antiquity
nor
of
the
renaissance
the
beyond
in
it
is
not
without
deep
pain
that
we
acknowledge
the
fact
that
in
their
loftiest
soarings
artists
of
all
ages
have
exalted
and
divinely
transfigured
precisely
those
ideas
which
we
now
recognise
as
false
they
are
the
glorifiers
of
humanity
religious
and
philosophical
errors
and
they
could
not
have
been
this
without
belief
in
the
absolute
truth
of
these
errors
but
if
the
belief
in
such
truth
diminishes
at
all
if
the
rainbow
colours
at
the
farthest
ends
of
human
knowledge
and
imagination
fade
then
this
kind
of
art
can
never
for
like
the
commedia
raphael
paintings
michelangelo
frescoes
and
gothic
cathedrals
they
indicate
not
only
a
cosmic
but
also
a
metaphysical
meaning
in
the
work
of
art
out
of
all
this
will
grow
a
touching
legend
that
such
an
art
and
such
an
artistic
faith
once
existed
revolution
in
the
strict
limit
which
the
french
dramatists
marked
out
with
regard
to
unity
of
action
time
and
place
construction
of
style
verse
and
sentence
selection
of
words
and
ideas
was
a
school
as
important
as
that
of
counterpoint
and
fugue
in
the
development
of
modern
music
or
that
of
the
gorgianic
figures
in
greek
oratory
such
a
restriction
may
appear
absurd
nevertheless
there
is
no
means
of
getting
out
of
naturalism
except
by
confining
ourselves
at
first
to
the
strongest
perhaps
most
arbitrary
means
thus
we
gradually
learn
to
walk
gracefully
on
the
narrow
paths
that
bridge
giddy
abysses
and
acquire
great
suppleness
of
movement
as
a
result
as
the
history
of
music
proves
to
our
living
eyes
here
we
see
how
step
by
step
the
fetters
get
looser
until
at
last
they
may
appear
to
be
altogether
thrown
off
this
is
the
highest
achievement
of
a
necessary
development
in
art
in
the
art
of
modern
poetry
there
existed
no
such
fortunate
gradual
emerging
from
fetters
lessing
held
up
to
scorn
in
germany
the
french
form
the
only
modern
form
of
art
and
pointed
to
shakespeare
and
thus
the
steadiness
of
that
unfettering
was
lost
and
a
spring
was
made
into
naturalism
that
is
back
into
the
beginnings
of
art
from
this
goethe
endeavoured
to
save
himself
by
always
trying
to
limit
himself
anew
in
different
ways
but
even
the
most
gifted
only
succeeds
by
continuously
experimenting
if
the
thread
of
development
has
once
been
broken
it
is
to
the
unconsciously
revered
if
also
repudiated
model
of
french
tragedy
that
schiller
owes
his
comparative
sureness
of
form
and
he
remained
fairly
independent
of
lessing
whose
dramatic
attempts
he
is
well
known
to
have
rejected
but
after
voltaire
the
french
themselves
suddenly
lacked
the
great
talents
which
would
have
led
the
development
of
tragedy
out
of
constraint
to
that
apparent
freedom
later
on
they
followed
the
german
example
and
made
a
spring
into
a
sort
of
state
of
nature
and
experiments
it
is
only
necessary
to
read
voltaire
mahomet
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
perceive
clearly
what
european
culture
has
lost
through
that
breaking
down
of
tradition
once
for
all
voltaire
was
the
last
of
the
great
dramatists
who
with
greek
proportion
controlled
his
manifold
soul
equal
even
to
the
greatest
storms
of
tragedy
he
was
able
to
do
what
no
german
could
because
the
french
nature
is
much
nearer
akin
to
the
greek
than
is
the
german
he
was
also
the
last
great
writer
who
in
the
wielding
of
prose
possessed
the
greek
ear
greek
artistic
conscientiousness
and
greek
simplicity
and
grace
he
was
also
one
of
the
last
men
able
to
combine
in
himself
the
greatest
freedom
of
mind
and
an
absolutely
unrevolutionary
way
of
thinking
without
being
inconsistent
and
cowardly
since
that
time
the
modern
spirit
with
its
restlessness
and
its
hatred
of
moderation
and
restrictions
has
obtained
the
mastery
on
all
sides
let
loose
at
first
by
the
fever
of
revolution
and
then
once
more
putting
a
bridle
on
itself
when
it
became
filled
with
fear
and
horror
at
itself
but
it
was
the
bridle
of
rigid
logic
no
longer
that
of
artistic
moderation
it
is
true
that
through
that
unfettering
for
a
time
we
are
able
to
enjoy
the
poetry
of
all
nations
everything
that
has
sprung
up
in
hidden
places
original
wild
wonderfully
beautiful
and
gigantically
irregular
from
up
to
the
great
barbarian
shakespeare
we
taste
the
joys
of
local
colour
and
costume
hitherto
unknown
to
all
artistic
nations
we
make
liberal
use
of
the
barbaric
advantages
of
our
time
which
goethe
accentuated
against
schiller
in
order
to
place
the
formlessness
of
his
in
the
most
favourable
light
but
for
how
much
longer
the
encroaching
flood
of
poetry
of
all
styles
and
all
nations
gradually
sweep
away
that
magic
garden
upon
which
a
quiet
and
hidden
growth
would
still
have
been
possible
all
poets
become
experimenting
imitators
daring
copyists
however
great
their
primary
strength
may
be
eventually
the
public
which
has
lost
the
habit
of
seeing
the
actual
artistic
fact
in
the
of
depicting
power
in
the
organising
mastery
over
all
come
ever
more
and
more
to
value
power
for
sake
colour
for
colour
sake
idea
for
idea
sake
inspiration
for
inspiration
sake
accordingly
it
will
not
enjoy
the
elements
and
conditions
of
the
work
of
art
unless
and
finally
will
make
the
very
natural
demand
that
the
artist
deliver
it
to
them
isolated
true
the
senseless
fetters
of
art
have
been
thrown
off
but
unconsciously
we
have
grown
accustomed
to
consider
all
fetters
all
restrictions
as
senseless
and
so
art
moves
towards
its
liberation
but
in
so
doing
it
touches
which
is
certainly
highly
edifying
upon
all
the
phases
of
its
beginning
its
childhood
its
incompleteness
its
sometime
boldness
and
excesses
in
perishing
it
interprets
its
origin
and
growth
one
of
the
great
ones
whose
instinct
may
be
relied
on
and
whose
theory
lacked
nothing
but
thirty
years
of
practice
lord
byron
once
said
that
with
regard
to
poetry
in
general
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
convinced
he
was
that
one
and
all
we
are
entirely
on
a
wrong
track
that
we
are
following
an
inwardly
false
revolutionary
system
and
that
either
our
own
generation
or
the
next
will
yet
arrive
at
this
same
conviction
it
is
the
same
lord
byron
who
said
that
he
looked
upon
shakespeare
as
the
very
worst
model
although
the
most
extraordinary
poet
and
does
not
goethe
mature
artistic
insight
in
the
second
half
of
his
life
say
practically
the
same
thing
that
insight
by
means
of
which
he
made
such
a
bound
in
advance
of
whole
generations
that
generally
speaking
it
may
be
said
that
goethe
influence
has
not
yet
begun
that
his
time
has
still
to
come
just
because
his
nature
held
him
fast
for
a
long
time
in
the
path
of
the
poetical
revolution
just
because
he
drank
to
the
dregs
of
whatsoever
new
sources
views
and
expedients
had
been
indirectly
discovered
through
that
breaking
down
of
tradition
of
all
that
had
been
unearthed
from
under
the
ruins
of
art
his
later
transformation
and
conversion
carries
so
much
weight
it
shows
that
he
felt
the
deepest
longing
to
win
back
the
traditions
of
art
and
to
give
in
fancy
the
ancient
perfection
and
completeness
to
the
abandoned
ruins
and
colonnades
of
the
temple
with
the
imagination
of
the
eye
at
least
should
the
strength
of
the
arm
be
found
too
weak
to
build
where
such
tremendous
powers
were
needed
even
to
destroy
thus
he
lived
in
art
as
in
the
remembrance
of
the
true
art
his
poetry
had
become
an
aid
to
remembrance
to
the
understanding
of
old
and
ages
of
art
with
respect
to
the
strength
of
the
new
age
his
demands
could
not
be
satisfied
but
the
pain
this
occasioned
was
amply
balanced
by
the
joy
that
they
have
satisfied
once
and
that
we
ourselves
can
still
participate
in
this
satisfaction
not
individuals
but
more
or
less
ideal
masks
no
reality
but
an
allegorical
generality
topical
characters
local
colours
toned
down
and
rendered
mythical
almost
to
the
point
of
invisibility
contemporary
feeling
and
the
problems
of
contemporary
society
reduced
to
the
simplest
forms
stripped
of
their
attractive
interesting
pathological
qualities
made
in
every
other
but
the
artistic
sense
no
new
materials
and
characters
but
the
old
ones
in
constant
new
animation
and
transformation
that
is
art
as
goethe
it
later
as
the
greeks
and
even
the
french
it
what
remains
of
it
is
true
that
art
has
a
much
greater
value
in
the
case
of
certain
metaphysical
hypotheses
for
instance
when
the
belief
obtains
that
the
character
is
unchangeable
and
that
the
essence
of
the
world
manifests
itself
continually
in
all
character
and
action
thus
the
artist
work
becomes
the
symbol
of
the
constant
while
according
to
our
views
the
artist
can
only
endow
his
picture
with
temporary
value
because
man
on
the
whole
has
developed
and
is
mutable
and
even
the
individual
man
has
nothing
fixed
and
constant
the
same
thing
holds
good
with
another
metaphysical
hypothesis
assuming
that
our
visible
world
were
only
a
delusion
as
metaphysicians
declare
then
art
would
come
very
near
to
the
real
world
for
there
would
then
be
far
too
much
similarity
between
the
world
of
appearance
and
the
of
the
artist
and
the
remaining
difference
would
place
the
meaning
of
art
higher
even
than
the
meaning
of
nature
because
art
would
represent
the
same
forms
the
types
and
models
of
nature
but
those
suppositions
are
false
and
what
position
does
art
retain
after
this
acknowledgment
above
all
for
centuries
it
has
taught
us
to
look
upon
life
in
every
shape
with
interest
and
pleasure
and
to
carry
our
feelings
so
far
that
at
last
we
exclaim
whatever
it
may
be
life
is
good
this
teaching
of
art
to
take
pleasure
in
existence
and
to
regard
human
life
as
a
piece
of
nature
without
too
vigorous
movement
as
an
object
of
regular
development
this
teaching
has
grown
into
us
it
reappears
as
an
need
of
knowledge
we
could
renounce
art
but
we
should
not
therewith
forfeit
the
ability
it
has
taught
us
just
as
we
have
given
up
religion
but
not
the
exalting
and
intensifying
of
temperament
acquired
through
religion
as
the
plastic
arts
and
music
are
the
standards
of
that
wealth
of
feeling
really
acquired
and
obtained
through
religion
so
also
after
a
disappearance
of
art
the
intensity
and
multiplicity
of
the
joys
of
life
which
it
had
implanted
in
us
would
still
demand
satisfaction
the
scientific
man
is
the
further
development
of
the
artistic
man
the
of
just
as
in
old
age
we
remember
our
youth
and
celebrate
festivals
of
memory
so
in
a
short
time
mankind
will
stand
towards
art
its
relation
will
be
that
of
a
of
the
joys
of
youth
never
perhaps
in
former
ages
was
art
dealt
with
so
seriously
and
thoughtfully
as
now
when
it
appears
to
be
surrounded
by
the
magic
influence
of
death
we
call
to
mind
that
greek
city
in
southern
italy
which
once
a
year
still
celebrates
its
greek
feasts
amidst
tears
and
mourning
that
foreign
barbarism
triumphs
ever
more
and
more
over
the
customs
its
people
brought
with
them
into
the
land
and
never
has
hellenism
been
so
much
appreciated
nowhere
has
this
golden
nectar
been
drunk
with
so
great
delight
as
amongst
these
fast
disappearing
hellenes
the
artist
will
soon
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
splendid
relic
and
to
him
as
to
a
wonderful
stranger
on
whose
power
and
beauty
depended
the
happiness
of
former
ages
there
will
be
paid
such
honour
as
is
not
often
enjoyed
by
one
of
our
race
the
best
in
us
is
perhaps
inherited
from
the
sentiments
of
former
times
to
which
it
is
hardly
possible
for
us
now
to
return
by
direct
ways
the
sun
has
already
disappeared
but
the
heavens
of
our
life
are
still
glowing
and
illumined
by
it
although
we
can
behold
it
no
longer
footnote
the
allusion
is
to

our
fifth
division
the
signs
of
higher
and
lower

ennoblement
through
history
teaches
that
a
race
of
people
is
best
preserved
where
the
greater
number
hold
one
common
spirit
in
consequence
of
the
similarity
of
their
accustomed
and
indisputable
principles
in
consequence
therefore
of
their
common
faith
thus
strength
is
afforded
by
good
and
thorough
customs
thus
is
learnt
the
subjection
of
the
individual
and
strenuousness
of
character
becomes
a
birth
gift
and
afterwards
is
fostered
as
a
habit
the
danger
to
these
communities
founded
on
individuals
of
strong
and
similar
character
is
that
gradually
increasing
stupidity
through
transmission
which
follows
all
stability
like
its
shadow
it
is
on
the
more
unrestricted
more
uncertain
and
morally
weaker
individuals
that
depends
the
of
such
communities
it
is
they
who
attempt
all
that
is
new
and
manifold
numbers
of
these
perish
on
account
of
their
weakness
without
having
achieved
any
specially
visible
effect
but
generally
particularly
when
they
have
descendants
they
flare
up
and
from
time
to
time
inflict
a
wound
on
the
stable
element
of
the
community
precisely
in
this
sore
and
weakened
place
the
community
is
with
something
new
but
its
general
strength
must
be
great
enough
to
absorb
and
assimilate
this
new
thing
into
its
blood
deviating
natures
are
of
the
utmost
importance
wherever
there
is
to
be
progress
every
wholesale
progress
must
be
preceded
by
a
partial
weakening
the
strongest
natures
the
type
the
weaker
ones
help
it
to
something
similar
happens
in
the
case
of
individuals
deterioration
a
mutilation
even
a
vice
and
above
all
a
physical
or
moral
loss
is
seldom
without
its
advantage
for
instance
a
sickly
man
in
the
midst
of
a
warlike
and
restless
race
will
perhaps
have
more
chance
of
being
alone
and
thereby
growing
quieter
and
wiser
the
man
will
possess
a
stronger
eye
the
blind
man
will
have
a
deeper
inward
sight
and
will
certainly
have
a
keener
sense
of
hearing
in
so
far
it
appears
to
me
that
the
famous
struggle
for
existence
is
not
the
only
point
of
view
from
which
an
explanation
can
be
given
of
the
progress
or
strengthening
of
an
individual
or
a
race
rather
must
two
different
things
converge
firstly
the
multiplying
of
stable
strength
through
mental
binding
in
faith
and
common
feeling
secondly
the
possibility
of
attaining
to
higher
aims
through
the
fact
that
there
are
deviating
natures
and
in
consequence
partial
weakening
and
wounding
of
the
stable
strength
it
is
precisely
the
weaker
nature
as
the
more
delicate
and
free
that
makes
all
progress
at
all
possible
a
people
that
is
crumbling
and
weak
in
any
one
part
but
as
a
whole
still
strong
and
healthy
is
able
to
absorb
the
infection
of
what
is
new
and
incorporate
it
to
its
advantage
the
task
of
education
in
a
single
individual
is
this
to
plant
him
so
firmly
and
surely
that
as
a
whole
he
can
no
longer
be
diverted
from
his
path
then
however
the
educator
must
wound
him
or
else
make
use
of
the
wounds
which
fate
inflicts
and
when
pain
and
need
have
thus
arisen
something
new
and
noble
can
be
inoculated
into
the
wounded
places
with
regard
to
the
state
machiavelli
says
that
the
form
of
government
is
of
very
small
importance
although
halfeducated
people
think
otherwise
the
great
aim
of
should
be
duration
which
all
else
inasmuch
as
it
is
more
valuable
than
liberty
it
is
only
with
securely
founded
and
guaranteed
duration
that
continual
development
and
ennobling
inoculation
are
at
all
possible
as
a
rule
however
authority
the
dangerous
companion
of
all
duration
will
rise
in
opposition
to
this
a
relative
we
call
that
man
a
who
thinks
otherwise
than
is
expected
of
him
in
consideration
of
his
origin
surroundings
position
and
office
or
by
reason
of
the
prevailing
contemporary
views
he
is
the
exception
fettered
minds
are
the
rule
these
latter
reproach
him
saying
that
his
free
principles
either
have
their
origin
in
a
desire
to
be
remarkable
or
else
cause
free
actions
to
inferred
that
is
to
say
actions
which
are
not
compatible
with
fettered
morality
sometimes
it
is
also
said
that
the
cause
of
such
and
such
free
principles
may
be
traced
to
mental
perversity
and
extravagance
but
only
malice
speaks
thus
nor
does
it
believe
what
it
says
but
wishes
thereby
to
do
an
injury
for
the
usually
bears
the
proof
of
his
greater
goodness
and
keenness
of
intellect
written
in
his
face
so
plainly
that
the
fettered
spirits
understand
it
well
enough
but
the
two
other
derivations
of
are
honestly
intended
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
are
created
in
one
or
other
of
these
ways
for
this
reason
however
the
tenets
to
which
they
attain
in
this
manner
might
be
truer
and
more
reliable
than
those
of
the
fettered
spirits
in
the
knowledge
of
truth
what
really
matters
is
the
of
it
not
the
impulse
under
which
it
was
sought
the
way
in
which
it
was
found
if
the
are
right
then
the
fettered
spirits
are
wrong
and
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
the
former
have
reached
truth
through
immorality
or
the
latter
hitherto
retained
hold
of
untruths
through
morality
moreover
it
is
not
essential
to
the
that
he
should
hold
more
correct
views
but
that
he
should
have
liberated
himself
from
what
was
customary
be
it
successfully
or
disastrously
as
a
rule
however
he
will
have
truth
or
at
least
the
spirit
of
on
his
side
he
demands
reasons
the
others
demand
faith
the
origin
of
the
fettered
spirit
does
not
take
up
his
position
from
conviction
but
from
habit
he
is
a
christian
for
instance
not
because
he
had
a
comprehension
of
different
creeds
and
could
take
his
choice
he
is
an
englishman
not
because
he
decided
for
england
but
he
found
christianity
and
england
and
accepted
them
without
any
reason
just
as
one
who
is
born
in
a
becomes
a
later
on
perhaps
as
he
was
a
christian
and
an
englishman
he
discovered
a
few
reasons
in
favour
of
his
habit
these
reasons
may
be
upset
but
he
is
not
therefore
upset
in
his
whole
position
for
instance
let
a
fettered
spirit
be
obliged
to
bring
forward
his
reasons
against
bigamy
and
then
it
will
be
seen
whether
his
holy
zeal
in
favour
of
monogamy
is
based
upon
reason
or
upon
custom
the
adoption
of
guiding
principles
without
reasons
is
called
conclusions
drawn
from
the
consequences
and
traced
back
to
reason
and
all
states
and
orders
of
society
professions
matrimony
education
law
all
these
find
strength
and
duration
only
in
the
faith
which
the
fettered
spirits
repose
in
them
that
is
in
the
absence
of
reasons
or
at
least
in
the
averting
of
inquiries
as
to
reasons
the
restricted
spirits
do
not
willingly
acknowledge
this
and
feel
that
it
is
a
christianity
however
which
was
very
simple
in
its
intellectual
ideas
remarked
nothing
of
this
required
faith
and
nothing
but
faith
and
passionately
repulsed
the
demand
for
reasons
it
pointed
to
the
success
of
faith
you
will
soon
feel
the
advantages
of
faith
it
suggested
and
through
faith
shall
ye
be
saved
as
an
actual
fact
the
state
pursues
the
same
course
and
every
father
brings
up
his
son
in
the
same
way
only
believe
this
he
says
and
you
will
soon
feel
the
good
it
does
this
implies
however
that
the
truth
of
an
opinion
is
proved
by
its
personal
usefulness
the
wholesomeness
of
a
doctrine
must
be
a
guarantee
for
its
intellectual
surety
and
solidity
it
is
exactly
as
if
an
accused
person
in
a
court
of
law
were
to
say
my
counsel
speaks
the
whole
truth
for
only
see
what
is
the
result
of
his
speech
i
shall
be
acquitted
because
the
fettered
spirits
retain
their
principles
on
account
of
their
usefulness
they
suppose
that
the
free
spirit
also
seeks
his
own
advantage
in
his
views
and
only
holds
that
to
be
true
which
is
profitable
to
him
but
as
he
appears
to
find
profitable
just
the
contrary
of
that
which
his
compatriots
or
equals
find
profitable
these
latter
assume
that
his
principles
are
dangerous
to
them
they
say
or
feel
he
must
not
be
right
for
he
is
injurious
to
us
the
strong
good
the
restriction
of
views
which
habit
has
made
instinct
leads
to
what
is
called
strength
of
character
when
any
one
acts
from
few
but
always
from
the
same
motives
his
actions
acquire
great
energy
if
these
actions
accord
with
the
principles
of
the
fettered
spirits
they
are
recognised
and
they
produce
moreover
in
those
who
perform
them
the
sensation
of
a
good
conscience
few
motives
energetic
action
and
a
good
conscience
compose
what
is
called
strength
of
character
the
man
of
strong
character
lacks
a
knowledge
of
the
many
possibilities
and
directions
of
action
his
intellect
is
fettered
and
restricted
because
in
a
given
case
it
shows
him
perhaps
only
two
possibilities
between
these
two
he
must
now
of
necessity
choose
in
accordance
with
his
whole
nature
and
he
does
this
easily
and
quickly
because
he
has
not
to
choose
between
fifty
possibilities
the
educating
surroundings
aim
at
fettering
every
individual
by
always
placing
before
him
the
smallest
number
of
possibilities
the
individual
is
always
treated
by
his
educators
as
if
he
were
indeed
something
new
but
should
become
a
if
he
makes
his
first
appearance
as
something
unknown
unprecedented
he
must
be
turned
into
something
known
and
precedented
in
a
child
the
familiar
manifestation
of
restriction
is
called
a
good
character
in
placing
itself
on
the
side
of
the
fettered
spirits
the
child
first
discloses
its
awakening
common
feeling
with
this
foundation
of
common
sentiment
he
will
eventually
become
useful
to
his
state
or
rank
the
standards
and
values
of
the
fettered
there
are
four
species
of
things
concerning
which
the
restricted
spirits
say
they
are
in
the
right
firstly
all
things
that
last
are
right
secondly
all
things
that
are
not
burdens
to
us
are
right
thirdly
all
things
that
are
advantageous
for
us
are
right
fourthly
all
things
for
which
we
have
made
sacrifices
are
right
the
last
sentence
for
instance
explains
why
a
war
that
was
begun
in
opposition
to
popular
feeling
is
carried
on
with
enthusiasm
directly
a
sacrifice
has
been
made
for
it
the
free
spirits
who
bring
their
case
before
the
forum
of
the
fettered
spirits
must
prove
that
free
spirits
always
existed
that
is
therefore
enduring
that
it
will
not
become
a
burden
and
finally
that
on
the
whole
they
are
an
advantage
to
the
fettered
spirits
it
is
because
they
can
not
convince
the
restricted
spirits
on
this
last
point
that
they
profit
nothing
by
having
proved
the
first
and
second
propositions
compared
with
him
who
has
tradition
on
his
side
and
requires
no
reasons
for
his
actions
the
free
spirit
is
always
weak
especially
in
action
for
he
is
acquainted
with
too
many
motives
and
points
of
view
and
has
therefore
an
uncertain
and
unpractised
hand
what
means
exist
of
making
him
in
spite
of
this
so
that
he
will
at
least
manage
to
survive
and
will
not
perish
ineffectually
what
is
the
source
of
the
strong
spirit
this
is
especially
the
question
as
to
the
production
of
genius
whence
comes
the
energy
the
unbending
strength
the
endurance
with
which
the
one
in
opposition
to
accepted
ideas
endeavours
to
obtain
an
entirely
individual
knowledge
of
the
world
the
rise
of
the
ingenuity
with
which
a
prisoner
seeks
the
means
of
freedom
the
most
and
patient
employment
of
every
smallest
advantage
can
teach
us
of
what
tools
nature
sometimes
makes
use
in
order
to
produce
genius
a
word
which
i
beg
will
be
understood
without
any
mythological
and
religious
flavour
she
nature
begins
it
in
a
dungeon
and
excites
to
the
utmost
its
desire
to
free
itself
or
to
give
another
picture
some
one
who
has
completely
his
in
a
wood
but
who
with
unusual
energy
strives
to
reach
the
open
in
one
direction
or
another
will
sometimes
discover
a
new
path
which
nobody
knew
previously
thus
arise
geniuses
who
are
credited
with
originality
it
has
already
been
said
that
mutilation
crippling
or
the
loss
of
some
important
organ
is
frequently
the
cause
of
the
unusual
development
of
another
organ
because
this
one
has
to
fulfil
its
own
and
also
another
function
this
explains
the
source
of
many
a
brilliant
talent
these
general
remarks
on
the
origin
of
genius
may
be
applied
to
the
special
case
the
origin
of
the
perfect
free
spirit
conjecture
as
to
the
origin
of
just
as
the
glaciers
increase
when
in
equatorial
regions
the
sun
shines
upon
the
seas
with
greater
force
than
hitherto
so
may
a
very
strong
and
spreading
be
a
proof
that
somewhere
or
other
the
force
of
feeling
has
grown
extraordinarily
the
voice
of
in
general
history
to
teach
the
following
about
the
production
of
genius
it
and
torments
mankind
calls
to
the
passions
of
envy
hatred
and
rivalry
drives
them
to
desperation
people
against
people
throughout
whole
centuries
then
perhaps
like
a
stray
spark
from
the
terrible
energy
thereby
aroused
there
flames
up
suddenly
the
light
of
genius
the
will
like
a
horse
maddened
by
the
rider
spur
thereupon
breaks
out
and
leaps
over
into
another
domain
he
who
could
attain
to
a
comprehension
of
the
production
of
genius
and
desires
to
carry
out
practically
the
manner
in
which
nature
usually
goes
to
work
would
have
to
be
just
as
evil
and
regardless
as
nature
itself
but
perhaps
we
have
not
heard
rightly
the
value
of
the
middle
of
the
it
is
possible
that
the
production
of
genius
is
reserved
to
a
limited
period
of
history
for
we
must
not
expect
from
the
future
everything
that
very
defined
conditions
were
able
to
produce
for
instance
not
the
astounding
effects
of
religious
feeling
this
has
had
its
day
and
much
that
is
very
good
can
never
grow
again
because
it
could
grow
out
of
that
alone
there
will
never
again
be
a
horizon
of
life
and
culture
that
is
bounded
by
religion
perhaps
even
the
type
of
the
saint
is
only
possible
with
that
certain
narrowness
of
intellect
which
apparently
has
completely
disappeared
and
thus
the
greatest
height
of
intelligence
has
perhaps
been
reserved
for
a
single
age
it
appeared
and
appears
for
we
are
still
in
that
age
when
an
extraordinary
energy
of
will
concentrates
itself
as
an
exceptional
case
upon
aims
that
height
will
no
longer
exist
when
this
wildness
and
energy
cease
to
be
cultivated
mankind
probably
approaches
nearer
to
its
actual
aim
in
the
middle
of
its
road
in
the
middle
time
of
its
existence
than
at
the
end
it
may
be
that
powers
with
which
for
instance
art
is
a
condition
die
out
altogether
the
pleasure
in
lying
in
the
undefined
the
symbolical
in
intoxication
in
ecstasy
might
fall
into
disrepute
for
certainly
when
life
is
ordered
in
the
perfect
state
the
present
will
provide
no
more
motive
for
poetry
and
it
would
only
be
those
persons
who
had
remained
behind
who
would
ask
for
poetical
unreality
these
then
would
assuredly
look
longingly
backwards
to
the
times
of
the
imperfect
state
of
society
to
times
genius
and
the
ideal
state
in
the
socialists
demand
a
comfortable
life
for
the
greatest
possible
number
if
the
lasting
house
of
this
life
of
comfort
the
perfect
state
had
really
been
attained
then
this
life
of
comfort
would
have
destroyed
the
ground
out
of
which
grow
the
great
intellect
and
the
mighty
individual
generally
mean
powerful
energy
were
this
state
reached
mankind
would
have
grown
too
weary
to
be
still
capable
of
producing
genius
must
we
not
hence
wish
that
life
should
retain
its
forcible
character
and
that
wild
forces
and
energies
should
continue
to
be
called
forth
afresh
but
warm
and
sympathetic
hearts
desire
precisely
the
of
that
wild
and
forcible
character
and
the
warmest
hearts
we
can
imagine
desire
it
the
most
passionately
of
all
whilst
all
the
time
its
passion
derived
its
fire
its
warmth
its
very
existence
precisely
from
that
wild
and
forcible
character
the
warmest
heart
therefore
desires
the
removal
of
its
own
foundation
the
destruction
of
itself
that
is
it
desires
something
illogical
it
is
not
intelligent
the
highest
intelligence
and
the
warmest
heart
can
not
exist
together
in
one
person
and
the
wise
man
who
passes
judgment
upon
life
looks
beyond
goodness
and
only
regards
it
as
something
which
is
not
without
value
in
the
general
of
life
the
wise
man
must
those
digressive
wishes
of
unintelligent
goodness
because
he
has
an
interest
in
the
continuance
of
his
type
and
in
the
eventual
appearance
of
the
highest
intellect
at
least
he
will
not
advance
the
founding
of
the
perfect
state
inasmuch
as
there
is
only
room
in
it
for
wearied
individuals
christ
on
the
contrary
he
whom
we
may
consider
to
have
had
the
warmest
heart
advanced
the
process
of
making
man
stupid
placed
himself
on
the
side
of
the
intellectually
poor
and
retarded
the
production
of
the
greatest
intellect
and
this
was
consistent
his
opposite
the
man
of
perfect
wisdom
this
may
be
safely
prophesied
will
just
as
necessarily
hinder
the
production
of
a
christ
the
state
is
a
wise
arrangement
for
the
protection
of
one
individual
against
another
if
its
ennobling
is
exaggerated
the
individual
will
at
last
be
weakened
by
it
even
effaced
thus
the
original
purpose
of
the
state
will
be
most
completely
frustrated
the
zones
of
it
may
be
figuratively
said
that
the
ages
of
culture
correspond
to
the
zones
of
the
various
climates
only
that
they
lie
one
behind
another
and
not
beside
each
other
like
the
geographical
zones
in
comparison
with
the
temperate
zone
of
culture
which
it
is
our
object
to
enter
the
past
speaking
generally
gives
the
impression
of
a
climate
violent
contrasts
sudden
changes
between
day
and
night
heat
and
the
reverence
of
all
that
was
sudden
mysterious
terrible
the
rapidity
with
which
storms
broke
everywhere
that
lavish
abundance
of
the
provisions
of
nature
and
opposed
to
this
in
our
culture
a
clear
but
by
no
means
bright
sky
pure
but
fairly
unchanging
air
sharpness
even
cold
at
times
thus
the
two
zones
are
contrasts
to
each
other
when
we
see
how
in
that
former
zone
the
most
raging
passions
are
suppressed
and
broken
down
with
mysterious
force
by
metaphysical
representations
we
feel
as
if
wild
tigers
were
being
crushed
before
our
very
eyes
in
the
coils
of
mighty
serpents
our
mental
climate
lacks
such
episodes
our
imagination
is
temperate
even
in
dreams
there
does
not
happen
to
us
what
former
peoples
saw
waking
but
should
we
not
rejoice
at
this
change
even
granted
that
artists
are
essentially
spoiled
by
the
disappearance
of
the
tropical
culture
and
find
us
a
little
too
timid
in
so
far
artists
are
certainly
right
to
deny
progress
for
indeed
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
last
three
thousand
years
show
an
advance
in
the
arts
in
the
same
way
a
metaphysical
philosopher
like
schopenhauer
would
have
no
cause
to
acknowledge
progress
with
a
regard
to
metaphysical
philosophy
and
religion
if
he
glanced
back
over
the
last
four
thousand
years
for
us
however
the
even
of
the
temperate
zones
of
culture
is
progress
renaissance
and
the
italian
renaissance
contained
within
itself
all
the
positive
forces
to
which
we
owe
modern
culture
such
were
the
liberation
of
thought
the
disregard
of
authorities
the
triumph
of
education
over
the
darkness
of
tradition
enthusiasm
for
science
and
the
scientific
past
of
mankind
the
unfettering
of
the
individual
an
ardour
for
truthfulness
and
a
dislike
of
delusion
and
mere
effect
which
ardour
blazed
forth
in
an
entire
company
of
artistic
characters
who
with
the
greatest
moral
purity
required
from
themselves
perfection
in
their
works
and
nothing
but
perfection
yes
the
renaissance
had
positive
forces
which
have
yet
never
become
so
mighty
again
in
our
modern
culture
it
was
the
golden
age
of
the
last
thousand
years
in
spite
of
all
its
blemishes
and
vices
on
the
other
hand
the
german
reformation
stands
out
as
an
energetic
protest
of
antiquated
spirits
who
were
by
no
means
tired
of
mediæval
views
of
life
and
who
received
the
signs
of
its
dissolution
the
extraordinary
flatness
and
alienation
of
the
religious
life
with
deep
dejection
instead
of
with
the
rejoicing
that
would
have
been
seemly
with
their
northern
strength
and
they
threw
mankind
back
again
brought
about
the
that
is
a
catholic
christianity
of
with
all
the
violences
of
a
state
of
siege
and
delayed
for
two
or
three
centuries
the
complete
awakening
and
mastery
of
the
sciences
just
as
they
probably
made
for
ever
impossible
the
complete
of
the
antique
and
the
modern
spirit
the
great
task
of
the
renaissance
could
not
be
brought
to
a
termination
this
was
prevented
by
the
protest
of
the
contemporary
backward
german
spirit
which
for
its
salvation
had
had
sufficient
sense
in
the
middle
ages
to
cross
the
alps
again
and
again
it
was
the
chance
of
an
extraordinary
constellation
of
politics
that
luther
was
preserved
and
that
his
protest
gained
strength
for
the
emperor
protected
him
in
order
to
employ
him
as
a
weapon
against
the
pope
and
in
the
same
way
he
was
secretly
favoured
by
the
pope
in
order
to
use
the
protestant
princes
as
a
against
the
emperor
without
this
curious
of
intentions
luther
would
have
been
burnt
like
huss
and
the
morning
sun
of
enlightenment
would
probably
have
risen
somewhat
earlier
and
with
a
splendour
more
beauteous
than
we
can
now
imagine
justice
against
the
becoming
when
the
entire
history
of
culture
unfolds
itself
to
our
gaze
as
a
confusion
of
evil
and
noble
of
true
and
false
ideas
and
we
feel
almost
seasick
at
the
sight
of
these
tumultuous
waves
we
then
under
stand
what
comfort
resides
in
the
conception
of
a
this
deity
is
unveiled
ever
more
and
more
throughout
the
changes
and
fortunes
of
mankind
it
is
not
all
blind
mechanism
a
senseless
and
aimless
confusion
of
forces
the
deification
of
the
process
of
being
is
a
metaphysical
outlook
seen
as
from
a
lighthouse
overlooking
the
sea
of
history
in
which
a
historical
generation
of
scholars
found
their
comfort
this
must
not
arouse
anger
however
erroneous
the
view
may
be
only
those
who
like
schopenhauer
deny
development
also
feel
none
of
the
misery
of
this
historical
wave
and
therefore
because
they
know
nothing
of
that
becoming
god
and
the
need
of
his
supposition
they
should
in
justice
withhold
their
scorn
the
fruits
according
to
their
every
better
future
that
is
desired
for
mankind
is
necessarily
in
many
respects
also
a
worse
future
for
it
is
foolishness
to
suppose
that
a
new
higher
grade
of
humanity
will
combine
in
itself
all
the
good
points
of
former
grades
and
must
produce
for
instance
the
highest
form
of
art
rather
has
every
season
its
own
advantages
and
charms
which
exclude
those
of
the
other
seasons
that
which
has
grown
out
of
religion
and
in
its
neighbourhood
can
not
grow
again
if
this
has
been
destroyed
at
the
most
straggling
and
belated
may
lead
to
deception
on
that
point
like
the
occasional
outbreaks
of
remembrance
of
the
old
art
a
condition
that
probably
betrays
the
feeling
of
loss
and
deprivation
but
which
is
no
proof
of
the
power
from
which
a
new
art
might
be
born
the
increasing
severity
of
the
the
higher
culture
an
individual
attains
the
less
field
there
is
left
for
mockery
and
scorn
voltaire
thanked
heaven
from
his
heart
for
the
invention
of
marriage
and
the
church
by
which
it
had
so
well
provided
for
our
cheer
but
he
and
his
time
and
before
him
the
sixteenth
century
had
exhausted
their
ridicule
on
this
theme
everything
that
is
now
made
fun
of
on
this
theme
is
out
of
date
and
above
all
too
cheap
to
tempt
a
purchaser
causes
are
now
inquired
after
ours
is
an
age
of
seriousness
who
cares
now
to
discern
laughingly
the
difference
between
reality
and
pretentious
sham
between
that
which
man
and
that
which
he
wishes
to
represent
the
feeling
of
this
contrast
has
quite
a
different
effect
if
we
seek
reasons
the
more
thoroughly
any
one
understands
life
the
less
he
will
mock
though
finally
perhaps
he
will
mock
at
the
thoroughness
of
his
understanding
the
genius
of
if
any
one
wished
to
imagine
a
genius
of
culture
what
would
it
be
like
it
handles
as
its
tools
falsehood
force
and
thoughtless
selfishness
so
surely
that
i
could
only
be
called
an
evil
demoniacal
being
but
its
aims
which
are
occasionally
transparent
are
great
and
good
it
is
a
centaur
and
in
addition
has
angel
wings
upon
its
head
the
interest
in
education
will
acquire
great
strength
only
from
the
moment
when
belief
in
a
god
and
his
care
is
renounced
just
as
the
art
of
healing
you
only
flourish
when
the
belief
in
ceased
so
far
however
there
is
universal
belief
in
the
out
of
the
greatest
disorder
and
confusion
of
aims
and
unfavourableness
of
conditions
the
most
fertile
and
mighty
men
have
been
seen
to
grow
could
this
happen
naturally
soon
these
cases
will
be
more
closely
looked
into
more
carefully
examined
but
miracles
will
never
be
discovered
in
similar
circumstances
countless
persons
perish
constantly
the
few
saved
have
therefore
usually
grown
stronger
because
they
endured
these
bad
conditions
by
virtue
of
an
inexhaustible
inborn
strength
and
this
strength
they
had
also
exercised
and
increased
by
fighting
against
these
circumstances
thus
the
miracle
is
explained
an
education
that
no
longer
believes
in
miracles
must
pay
attention
to
three
things
first
how
much
energy
is
inherited
secondly
by
what
means
can
new
energy
be
aroused
thirdly
how
can
the
individual
be
adapted
to
so
many
and
manifold
claims
of
culture
without
being
disquieted
and
destroying
his
personality
in
short
how
can
the
individual
be
initiated
into
the
counterpoint
of
private
and
public
culture
how
can
he
lead
the
melody
and
at
the
same
time
accompany
it
the
future
of
the
there
is
now
no
profession
which
would
admit
of
such
an
enhancement
as
that
of
the
physician
that
is
after
the
spiritual
physicians
the
pastors
are
no
longer
allowed
to
practise
their
conjuring
tricks
to
public
applause
and
a
cultured
person
gets
out
of
their
way
the
highest
mental
development
of
a
physician
has
not
yet
been
reached
even
if
he
understands
the
best
and
newest
methods
is
practised
in
them
and
knows
how
to
draw
those
rapid
conclusions
from
effects
to
causes
for
which
the
diagnostics
are
celebrated
besides
this
he
must
possess
a
gift
of
eloquence
that
adapts
itself
to
every
individual
and
draws
his
heart
out
of
his
body
a
manliness
the
sight
of
which
alone
drives
away
all
despondency
the
canker
of
all
sick
people
the
tact
and
suppleness
of
a
diplomatist
in
negotiations
between
such
as
have
need
of
joy
for
their
recovery
and
such
as
for
reasons
of
health
must
and
can
give
joy
the
acuteness
of
a
detective
and
an
attorney
to
divine
the
secrets
of
a
soul
without
betraying
them
in
short
a
good
physician
now
has
need
of
all
the
artifices
and
artistic
privileges
of
every
other
professional
class
thus
equipped
he
is
then
ready
to
be
a
benefactor
to
the
whole
of
society
by
increasing
good
works
mental
joys
and
fertility
by
preventing
evil
thoughts
projects
and
villainies
the
evil
source
of
which
is
so
often
the
belly
by
the
restoration
of
a
mental
and
physical
aristocracy
as
a
maker
and
hinderer
of
marriages
by
judiciously
checking
all
and
pricks
of
conscience
thus
from
a
medicine
man
he
becomes
a
saviour
and
yet
need
work
no
miracle
neither
is
he
obliged
to
let
himself
be
crucified
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sum
of
sensations
knowledge
and
experiences
the
whole
burden
of
culture
therefore
has
become
so
great
that
an
overstraining
of
nerves
and
powers
of
thought
is
a
common
danger
indeed
the
cultivated
classes
of
european
countries
are
throughout
neurotic
and
almost
every
one
of
their
great
families
is
on
the
verge
of
insanity
in
one
of
their
branches
true
health
is
now
sought
in
every
possible
way
but
in
the
main
a
diminution
of
that
tension
of
feeling
of
that
oppressive
burden
of
culture
is
needful
which
even
though
it
might
be
bought
at
a
heavy
sacrifice
would
at
least
give
us
room
for
the
great
hope
of
a
to
christianity
to
the
philosophers
poets
and
musicians
we
owe
an
abundance
of
deeply
emotional
sensations
in
order
that
these
may
not
get
beyond
our
control
we
must
invoke
the
spirit
of
science
which
on
the
whole
makes
us
somewhat
colder
and
more
sceptical
and
in
particular
cools
the
faith
in
final
and
absolute
truths
it
is
chiefly
through
christianity
that
it
has
grown
so
wild
the
of
culture
has
been
made
like
a
bell
within
a
covering
of
coarser
commoner
material
falsehood
violence
the
boundless
extension
of
every
individual
i
of
every
separate
people
this
was
the
covering
is
it
time
to
take
it
off
has
the
liquid
set
have
the
good
and
useful
impulses
the
habits
of
the
nobler
nature
become
so
certain
and
so
general
that
they
no
longer
require
to
lean
on
metaphysics
and
the
errors
of
religion
no
longer
have
need
of
hardnesses
and
violence
as
powerful
bonds
between
man
and
man
people
and
people
no
sign
from
any
god
can
any
longer
help
us
to
answer
this
question
our
own
insight
must
decide
the
earthly
rule
of
man
must
be
taken
in
hand
by
man
himself
his
omniscience
must
watch
over
the
further
fate
of
culture
with
a
sharp
eye
the
cyclopes
of
whoever
has
seen
those
furrowed
basins
which
once
contained
glaciers
will
hardly
deem
it
possible
that
a
time
will
come
when
the
same
spot
will
be
a
valley
of
woods
and
meadows
and
streams
it
is
the
same
in
the
history
of
mankind
the
wildest
forces
break
the
way
destructively
at
first
but
their
activity
was
nevertheless
necessary
in
order
that
later
on
a
milder
civilisation
might
build
up
its
house
these
terrible
energies
that
which
is
called
evil
are
the
cyclopic
architects
and
of
humanity
the
circulation
of
it
is
possible
that
all
humanity
is
only
a
phase
of
development
of
a
certain
species
of
animal
of
limited
duration
man
may
have
grown
out
of
the
ape
and
will
return
to
the
ape
again
without
anybody
taking
an
interest
in
the
ending
of
this
curious
comedy
just
as
with
the
decline
of
roman
civilisation
and
its
most
important
cause
the
spread
of
christianity
there
was
a
general
uglification
of
man
within
the
roman
empire
so
through
the
eventual
decline
of
general
culture
there
might
result
a
far
greater
uglification
and
finally
an
animalising
of
man
till
he
reached
the
ape
but
just
because
we
are
able
to
face
this
prospect
we
shall
perhaps
be
able
to
avert
such
an
end
the
consoling
speech
of
a
desperate
our
age
gives
the
impression
of
an
intermediate
condition
the
old
ways
of
regarding
the
world
the
old
cultures
still
partially
exist
the
new
are
not
yet
sure
and
customary
and
hence
are
without
decision
and
consistency
it
appears
as
if
everything
would
become
chaotic
as
if
the
old
were
being
lost
the
new
worthless
and
ever
becoming
weaker
but
this
is
what
the
soldier
feels
who
is
learning
to
march
for
a
time
he
is
more
uncertain
and
awkward
because
his
muscles
are
moved
sometimes
according
to
the
old
system
and
sometimes
according
to
the
new
and
neither
gains
decisive
victory
we
waver
but
it
is
necessary
not
to
lose
courage
and
give
up
what
we
have
newly
gained
moreover
we
go
back
to
the
old
we
burnt
our
boats
there
remains
nothing
but
to
be
brave
whatever
ahead
only
get
forward
perhaps
our
behaviour
looks
like
but
if
not
then
the
words
of
frederick
the
great
may
also
be
applied
to
us
and
indeed
as
a
consolation
mon
cher
sulzer
vous
ne
connaissez
pas
assez
cette
race
maudite
à
laquelle
nous
suffering
from
past
whoever
has
solved
the
problem
of
culture
suffers
from
a
feeling
similar
to
that
of
one
who
has
inherited
riches
or
of
a
prince
who
reigns
thanks
to
the
violence
of
his
ancestors
he
thinks
of
their
origin
with
grief
and
is
often
ashamed
often
irritable
the
whole
sum
of
strength
joy
vigour
which
he
devotes
to
his
possessions
is
often
balanced
by
a
deep
weariness
he
can
not
forget
their
origin
he
looks
despondingly
at
the
future
he
knows
well
that
his
successors
will
suffer
from
the
past
as
he
does
good
manners
disappear
in
proportion
as
the
influence
of
a
court
and
an
exclusive
aristocracy
lessens
this
decrease
can
be
plainly
observed
from
decade
to
decade
by
those
who
have
an
eye
for
public
behaviour
which
grows
visibly
more
vulgar
no
one
any
longer
knows
how
to
court
and
flatter
intelligently
hence
arises
the
ludicrous
fact
that
in
cases
where
we
render
actual
homage
to
a
great
statesman
or
artist
for
instance
the
words
of
deepest
feeling
of
simple
honesty
have
to
be
borrowed
owing
to
the
embarrassment
resulting
from
the
lack
of
grace
and
wit
thus
the
public
ceremonious
meeting
of
men
appears
ever
more
clumsy
but
more
full
of
feeling
and
honesty
without
really
being
so
but
must
there
always
be
a
decline
in
manners
it
appears
to
me
rather
that
manners
take
a
deep
curve
and
that
we
are
approaching
their
lowest
point
when
society
has
become
sure
of
its
intentions
and
principles
so
that
they
have
a
moulding
effect
the
manners
we
have
learnt
from
former
moulding
conditions
are
now
inherited
and
always
more
weakly
learnt
there
will
then
be
company
manners
gestures
and
social
expressions
which
must
appear
as
necessary
and
simply
natural
because
they
are
intentions
and
principles
the
better
division
of
time
and
work
the
gymnastic
exercise
transformed
into
the
accompaniment
of
all
beautiful
leisure
increased
and
severer
meditation
which
brings
wisdom
and
suppleness
even
to
the
body
will
bring
all
this
in
its
train
here
indeed
we
might
think
with
a
smile
of
our
scholars
and
consider
whether
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
who
wish
to
be
regarded
as
the
forerunners
of
that
new
culture
are
distinguished
by
their
better
manners
this
is
hardly
the
case
although
their
spirit
may
be
willing
enough
their
flesh
is
weak
the
past
of
culture
is
still
too
powerful
in
their
muscles
they
still
stand
in
a
fettered
position
and
are
half
worldly
priests
and
half
dependent
educators
of
the
upper
classes
and
besides
this
they
have
been
rendered
crippled
and
lifeless
by
the
pedantry
of
science
and
by
antiquated
spiritless
methods
in
any
case
therefore
they
are
physically
and
often
mentally
still
the
courtiers
of
an
old
even
antiquated
culture
and
as
such
are
themselves
antiquated
the
new
spirit
that
occasionally
inhabits
these
old
dwellings
often
serves
only
to
make
them
more
uncertain
and
frightened
in
them
there
dwell
the
ghosts
of
the
past
as
well
as
the
ghosts
of
the
future
what
wonder
if
they
do
not
wear
the
best
expression
or
show
the
most
pleasing
behaviour
the
future
of
to
him
who
works
and
seeks
in
her
science
gives
much
pleasure
to
him
who
her
facts
very
little
but
as
all
important
truths
of
science
must
gradually
become
commonplace
and
everyday
matters
even
this
small
amount
of
pleasure
ceases
just
as
we
have
long
ceased
to
take
pleasure
in
learning
the
admirable
multiplication
table
now
if
science
goes
on
giving
less
pleasure
in
herself
and
always
takes
more
pleasure
in
throwing
suspicion
on
the
consolations
of
metaphysics
religion
and
art
that
greatest
of
all
sources
of
pleasure
to
which
mankind
owes
almost
its
whole
humanity
becomes
impoverished
therefore
a
higher
culture
must
give
man
a
double
brain
two
so
to
speak
one
to
feel
science
and
the
other
to
feel
which
can
lie
side
by
side
without
confusion
divisible
exclusive
this
is
a
necessity
of
health
in
one
part
lies
the
source
of
strength
in
the
other
lies
the
regulator
it
must
be
heated
with
illusions
onesidednesses
passions
and
the
malicious
and
dangerous
consequences
of
must
be
averted
by
the
help
of
conscious
science
if
this
necessity
of
the
higher
culture
is
not
satisfied
the
further
course
of
human
development
can
almost
certainly
be
foretold
the
interest
in
what
is
true
ceases
as
it
guarantees
less
pleasure
illusion
error
and
imagination
reconquer
step
by
step
the
ancient
territory
because
they
are
united
to
pleasure
the
ruin
of
science
the
relapse
into
barbarism
is
the
next
result
mankind
must
begin
to
weave
its
web
afresh
after
having
like
penelope
destroyed
it
during
the
night
but
who
will
assure
us
that
it
will
always
find
the
necessary
strength
for
this
the
pleasure
in
why
is
discernment
that
essence
of
the
searcher
and
the
philosopher
connected
with
pleasure
firstly
and
above
all
because
thereby
we
become
conscious
of
our
strength
for
the
same
reason
that
gymnastic
exercises
even
without
spectators
are
enjoyable
secondly
because
in
the
course
of
knowledge
we
surpass
older
ideas
and
their
representatives
and
become
or
believe
ourselves
to
be
conquerors
thirdly
because
even
a
very
little
new
knowledge
exalts
us
above
one
and
makes
us
feel
we
are
the
only
ones
who
know
the
subject
aright
these
are
the
three
most
important
reasons
of
the
pleasure
but
there
are
many
others
according
to
the
nature
of
the
discerner
a
not
inconsiderable
index
of
such
is
given
where
no
one
would
look
for
it
in
a
passage
of
my
parenetic
work
on
schopenhauer
with
the
arrangement
of
which
every
experienced
servant
of
knowledge
may
be
satisfied
even
though
he
might
wish
to
dispense
with
the
ironical
touch
that
seems
to
pervade
those
pages
for
if
it
be
true
that
for
the
making
of
a
scholar
a
number
of
very
human
impulses
and
desires
must
be
thrown
together
that
the
scholar
is
indeed
a
very
noble
but
not
a
pure
metal
and
consists
of
a
confused
blending
of
very
different
impulses
and
attractions
the
same
thing
may
be
said
equally
of
the
making
and
nature
of
the
artist
the
philosopher
and
the
moral
genius
and
whatever
glorified
great
names
there
may
be
in
that
list
human
deserves
ironical
consideration
with
respect
to
its
therefore
irony
is
so
in
the
world
fidelity
as
a
proof
of
it
is
a
perfect
sign
of
a
sound
theory
if
during
its
originator
does
not
mistrust
it
but
i
maintain
that
there
has
never
yet
been
a
philosopher
who
has
not
eventually
deprecated
the
philosophy
of
his
youth
perhaps
however
he
has
not
spoken
publicly
of
this
change
of
opinion
for
reasons
of
ambition
or
what
is
more
probable
in
noble
natures
out
of
delicate
consideration
for
his
adherents
the
increase
of
what
is
in
the
course
of
higher
education
everything
becomes
interesting
to
man
he
knows
how
to
find
the
instructive
side
of
a
thing
quickly
and
to
put
his
finger
on
the
place
where
it
can
fill
up
a
gap
in
his
ideas
or
where
it
may
verify
a
thought
through
this
boredom
disappears
more
and
more
and
so
does
excessive
excitability
of
temperament
finally
he
moves
among
men
like
a
botanist
among
plants
and
looks
upon
himself
as
a
phenomenon
which
only
greatly
excites
his
discerning
instinct
the
superstition
of
the
simultaneous
things
hold
together
it
is
said
a
relative
dies
far
away
and
at
the
same
time
we
dream
about
him
consequently
but
countless
relatives
die
and
we
do
not
dream
about
them
it
is
like
shipwrecked
people
who
make
vows
afterwards
in
the
temples
we
do
not
see
the
votive
tablets
of
those
who
perished
a
man
dies
an
owl
hoots
a
clock
stops
all
at
one
hour
of
the
night
must
there
not
be
some
connection
such
an
intimacy
with
nature
as
this
supposition
implies
is
flattering
to
mankind
this
species
of
superstition
is
found
again
in
a
refined
form
in
historians
and
delineators
of
culture
who
usually
have
a
kind
of
hydrophobic
horror
of
all
that
senseless
mixture
in
which
individual
and
national
life
is
so
rich
action
and
not
knowledge
exercised
by
the
value
of
strictly
pursuing
science
for
a
time
does
not
lie
precisely
in
its
results
for
these
in
proportion
to
the
ocean
of
what
is
worth
knowing
are
but
an
infinitesimally
small
drop
but
it
gives
an
additional
energy
decisiveness
and
toughness
of
endurance
it
teaches
how
to
attain
an
in
so
far
it
is
very
valuable
with
a
view
to
all
that
is
done
later
on
to
have
once
been
a
scientific
man
the
youthful
charm
of
the
search
for
truth
still
retains
the
charm
of
being
in
strong
contrast
to
gray
and
now
tiresome
error
but
this
charm
is
gradually
disappearing
it
is
true
we
still
live
in
the
youthful
age
of
science
and
are
accustomed
to
follow
truth
as
a
lovely
girl
but
how
will
it
be
when
one
day
she
becomes
an
elderly
looking
woman
in
almost
all
sciences
the
fundamental
knowledge
is
either
found
in
earliest
times
or
is
still
being
sought
what
a
different
attraction
this
exerts
compared
to
that
time
when
everything
essential
has
been
found
and
there
only
remains
for
the
seeker
a
scanty
gleaning
which
sensation
may
be
learnt
in
several
historical
disciplines
the
statue
of
the
genius
of
culture
fares
as
did
cellini
when
his
statue
of
perseus
was
being
cast
the
molten
mass
threatened
to
run
short
but
it
to
suffice
so
he
flung
in
his
plates
and
dishes
and
whatever
else
his
hands
fell
upon
in
the
same
way
genius
flings
in
errors
vices
hopes
ravings
and
other
things
of
baser
as
well
as
of
nobler
metal
for
the
statue
of
humanity
must
emerge
and
be
finished
what
does
it
matter
if
commoner
material
is
used
here
and
there
a
male
the
greek
culture
of
the
classic
age
is
a
male
culture
as
far
as
women
are
concerned
pericles
expresses
everything
in
the
funeral
speech
they
are
best
when
they
are
as
little
spoken
of
as
possible
amongst
men
the
erotic
relation
of
men
to
youths
was
the
necessary
and
sole
preparation
to
a
degree
unattainable
to
our
comprehension
of
all
manly
education
pretty
much
as
for
a
long
time
all
higher
education
of
women
was
only
attainable
through
love
and
marriage
all
idealism
of
the
strength
of
the
greek
nature
threw
itself
into
that
relation
and
it
is
probable
that
never
since
have
young
men
been
treated
so
attentively
so
lovingly
so
entirely
with
a
view
to
their
welfare
as
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
centuries
according
to
the
beautiful
saying
of
hölderlin
liebend
giebt
der
sterbliche
vom
besten
the
higher
the
light
in
which
this
relation
was
regarded
the
lower
sank
intercourse
with
woman
nothing
else
was
taken
into
consideration
than
the
production
of
children
and
lust
there
was
no
intellectual
intercourse
not
even
real
if
it
be
further
remembered
that
women
were
even
excluded
from
contests
and
spectacles
of
every
description
there
only
remain
the
religious
cults
as
their
sole
higher
occupation
for
although
in
the
tragedies
electra
and
antigone
were
represented
this
was
only
in
art
but
not
liked
in
real
life
just
as
now
we
can
not
endure
anything
pathetic
in
but
like
it
in
art
the
women
had
no
other
mission
than
to
produce
beautiful
strong
bodies
in
which
the
father
character
lived
on
as
unbrokenly
as
possible
and
therewith
to
counteract
the
increasing
of
such
a
highly
developed
culture
this
kept
the
greek
culture
young
for
a
relatively
long
time
for
in
the
greek
mothers
the
greek
genius
always
returned
to
nature
the
prejudice
in
favour
of
it
is
clear
that
men
overvalue
everything
great
and
prominent
this
arises
from
the
conscious
or
unconscious
idea
that
they
deem
it
very
useful
when
one
person
throws
all
his
strength
into
one
thing
and
makes
himself
into
a
monstrous
organ
assuredly
an
development
of
all
his
powers
is
more
useful
and
happier
for
man
for
every
talent
is
a
vampire
which
sucks
blood
and
strength
from
other
powers
and
an
exaggerated
production
can
drive
the
most
gifted
almost
to
madness
within
the
circle
of
the
arts
too
extreme
natures
excite
far
too
much
attention
but
a
much
lower
culture
is
necessary
to
be
captivated
by
them
men
submit
from
habit
to
everything
that
seeks
power
the
tyrants
of
the
it
is
only
where
the
ray
of
myth
falls
that
the
life
of
the
greeks
shines
otherwise
it
is
gloomy
the
greek
philosophers
are
now
robbing
themselves
of
this
myth
is
it
not
as
if
they
wished
to
quit
the
sunshine
for
shadow
and
gloom
yet
no
plant
avoids
the
light
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
those
philosophers
were
only
seeking
a
sun
the
myth
was
not
pure
enough
not
shining
enough
for
them
they
found
this
light
in
their
knowledge
in
that
which
each
of
them
called
his
truth
but
in
those
times
knowledge
shone
with
a
greater
glory
it
was
still
young
and
knew
but
little
of
all
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
its
path
it
could
still
hope
to
reach
in
one
single
bound
the
central
point
of
all
being
and
from
thence
to
solve
the
riddle
of
the
world
these
philosophers
had
a
firm
belief
in
themselves
and
their
truth
and
with
it
they
overthrew
all
their
neighbours
and
predecessors
each
one
was
a
warlike
violent
the
happiness
in
believing
themselves
the
possessors
of
truth
was
perhaps
never
greater
in
the
world
but
neither
were
the
hardness
the
arrogance
and
the
tyranny
and
evil
of
such
a
belief
they
were
tyrants
they
were
that
therefore
which
every
greek
wanted
to
be
and
which
every
one
was
if
he
perhaps
solon
alone
is
an
exception
he
tells
in
his
poems
how
he
disdained
personal
tyranny
but
he
did
it
for
love
of
his
works
of
his
and
to
be
a
is
a
sublimated
form
of
tyranny
parmenides
also
made
laws
pythagoras
and
empedocles
probably
did
the
same
anaximander
founded
a
city
plato
was
the
incarnate
wish
to
become
the
greatest
philosophic
and
founder
of
states
he
appears
to
have
suffered
terribly
over
the
of
his
nature
and
towards
his
end
his
soul
was
filled
with
the
bitterest
gall
the
more
the
greek
philosophers
lost
in
power
the
more
they
suffered
inwardly
from
this
bitterness
and
malice
when
the
various
sects
fought
for
their
truths
in
the
street
then
first
were
the
souls
of
these
wooers
of
truth
completely
clogged
through
envy
and
spleen
the
tyrannical
element
then
raged
like
poison
within
their
bodies
these
many
petty
tyrants
would
have
liked
to
devour
each
other
there
survived
not
a
single
spark
of
love
and
very
little
joy
in
their
own
knowledge
the
saying
that
tyrants
are
generally
murdered
and
that
their
descendants
are
is
true
also
of
the
tyrants
of
the
mind
their
history
is
short
and
violent
and
their
break
off
suddenly
it
may
be
said
of
almost
all
great
hellenes
that
they
appear
to
have
come
too
late
it
was
thus
with
æschylus
with
pindar
with
demosthenes
with
thucydides
one
generation
and
then
it
is
passed
for
ever
that
is
the
stormy
and
dismal
element
in
greek
history
we
now
it
is
true
admire
the
gospel
of
the
tortoises
to
think
historically
is
almost
the
same
thing
now
as
if
in
all
ages
history
had
been
made
according
to
the
theory
the
smallest
possible
amount
in
the
longest
possible
time
oh
how
quickly
greek
history
runs
on
since
then
life
has
never
been
so
extravagant
so
unbounded
i
can
not
persuade
myself
that
the
history
of
the
greeks
followed
that
natural
course
for
which
it
is
so
celebrated
they
were
much
too
variously
gifted
to
be
the
orderly
manner
of
the
tortoise
when
running
a
race
with
achilles
and
that
is
called
natural
development
the
geeks
went
rapidly
forward
but
equally
rapidly
downwards
the
movement
of
the
whole
machine
is
so
intensified
that
a
single
stone
thrown
amid
its
wheels
was
sufficient
to
break
it
such
a
stone
for
instance
was
socrates
the
hitherto
so
wonderfully
regular
although
certainly
too
rapid
development
of
the
philosophical
science
was
destroyed
in
one
night
it
is
no
idle
question
whether
plato
had
he
remained
free
from
the
socratic
charm
would
not
have
discovered
a
still
higher
type
of
the
philosophic
man
which
type
is
for
ever
lost
to
us
we
look
into
the
ages
before
him
as
into
a
sculptor
workshop
of
such
types
the
fifth
and
sixth
centuries
seemed
to
promise
something
more
and
higher
even
than
they
produced
they
stopped
short
at
promising
and
announcing
and
yet
there
is
hardly
a
greater
loss
than
the
loss
of
a
type
of
a
new
hitherto
undiscovered
highest
of
the
philosophic
life
even
of
the
older
type
the
greater
number
are
badly
transmitted
it
seems
to
me
that
all
philosophers
from
thales
to
democritus
are
remarkably
difficult
to
recognise
but
whoever
succeeds
in
imitating
these
figures
walks
amongst
specimens
of
the
mightiest
and
purest
type
this
ability
is
certainly
rare
it
was
even
absent
in
those
later
greeks
who
occupied
themselves
with
the
knowledge
of
the
older
philosophy
aristotle
especially
hardly
seems
to
have
had
eyes
in
his
head
when
he
stands
before
these
great
ones
and
thus
it
appears
as
if
these
splendid
philosophers
had
lived
in
vain
or
as
if
they
had
only
been
intended
to
prepare
the
quarrelsome
and
talkative
followers
of
the
socratic
schools
as
i
have
said
here
is
a
gap
a
break
in
development
some
great
misfortune
must
have
happened
and
the
only
statue
which
might
have
revealed
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
that
great
artistic
training
was
either
broken
or
unsuccessful
what
actually
happened
has
remained
for
ever
a
secret
of
the
workshop
that
which
happened
amongst
the
greeks
namely
that
every
great
thinker
who
believed
himself
to
be
in
possession
of
the
absolute
truth
became
a
tyrant
so
that
even
the
mental
history
of
the
greeks
acquired
that
violent
hasty
and
dangerous
character
shown
by
their
political
history
this
type
of
event
was
not
therewith
exhausted
much
that
is
similar
has
happened
even
in
more
modern
times
although
gradually
becoming
rarer
and
now
but
seldom
showing
the
pure
naïve
conscience
of
the
greek
philosophers
for
on
the
whole
opposition
doctrines
and
scepticism
now
speak
too
powerfully
too
loudly
the
period
of
mental
tyranny
is
past
it
is
true
that
in
the
spheres
of
higher
culture
there
must
always
be
a
supremacy
but
henceforth
this
supremacy
lies
in
the
hands
of
the
of
the
in
spite
of
local
and
political
separation
they
form
a
cohesive
society
whose
members
and
each
other
whatever
public
opinion
and
the
verdicts
of
review
and
newspaper
writers
who
influence
the
masses
may
circulate
in
favour
of
or
against
them
mental
superiority
which
formerly
divided
and
embittered
nowadays
generally
how
could
the
separate
individuals
assert
themselves
and
swim
through
life
on
their
own
course
against
all
currents
if
they
did
not
see
others
like
them
living
here
and
there
under
similar
conditions
and
grasped
their
hands
in
the
struggle
as
much
against
the
ochlocratic
character
of
the
half
mind
and
half
culture
as
against
the
occasional
attempts
to
establish
a
tyranny
with
the
help
of
the
masses
oligarchs
are
necessary
to
each
other
they
are
each
other
best

they
understand
their
signs
but
each
is
nevertheless
free
he
fights
and
conquers
in
place
and
perishes
rather
than
submit
the
greatest
fact
in
greek
culture
remains
this
that
homer
became
so
early
all
mental
and
human
freedom
to
which
the
greeks
attained
is
traceable
to
this
fact
at
the
same
time
it
has
actually
been
fatal
to
greek
culture
for
homer
levelled
inasmuch
as
he
centralised
and
dissolved
the
more
serious
instincts
of
independence
from
time
to
time
there
arose
from
the
depths
of
hellenism
an
opposition
to
homer
but
he
always
remained
victorious
all
great
mental
powers
have
an
oppressing
effect
as
well
as
a
liberating
one
but
it
certainly
makes
a
difference
whether
it
is
homer
or
the
bible
or
science
that
tyrannises
over
mankind
in
such
a
highly
developed
humanity
as
the
present
each
individual
naturally
has
access
to
many
talents
each
has
an
talent
but
only
in
a
few
is
that
degree
of
toughness
endurance
and
energy
born
and
trained
that
he
really
becomes
a
talent
what
he
that
is
that
he
discharges
it
in
works
and
actions
the
witty
person
either
overvalued
or
unscientific
but
talented
people
value
every
mark
of
intelligence
whether
it
be
on
a
true
or
a
false
track
above
all
they
want
the
person
with
whom
they
have
intercourse
to
entertain
them
with
his
wit
to
spur
them
on
to
inflame
them
to
carry
them
away
in
seriousness
and
play
and
in
any
case
to
be
a
powerful
amulet
to
protect
them
against
boredom
scientific
natures
on
the
other
hand
know
that
the
gift
of
possessing
all
manner
of
notions
should
be
strictly
controlled
by
the
scientific
spirit
it
is
not
that
which
shines
deludes
and
excites
but
the
often
insignificant
truth
that
is
the
fruit
which
he
knows
how
to
shake
down
from
the
tree
of
knowledge
like
aristotle
he
is
not
permitted
to
make
any
distinction
between
the
bores
and
the
wits
his
leads
him
through
the
desert
as
well
as
through
tropical
vegetation
in
order
that
he
may
only
take
pleasure
in
the
really
actual
tangible
true
in
insignificant
scholars
this
produces
a
general
disdain
and
suspicion
of
cleverness
and
on
the
other
hand
clever
people
frequently
have
an
aversion
to
science
as
have
for
instance
almost
all
artists
sense
in
school
has
no
task
more
important
than
to
teach
strict
thought
cautious
judgment
and
logical
conclusions
hence
it
must
pay
no
attention
to
what
hinders
these
operations
such
as
religion
for
instance
it
can
count
on
the
fact
that
human
vagueness
custom
and
need
will
later
on
unstring
the
bow
of
thought
but
so
long
as
its
influence
lasts
it
should
enforce
that
which
is
the
essential
and
distinguishing
point
in
man
sense
and
science
the
power
of
man
as
goethe
judges
the
great
natural
philosopher
von
baer
thinks
that
the
superiority
of
all
europeans
when
compared
to
asiatics
lies
in
the
trained
capability
of
giving
reasons
for
that
which
they
believe
of
which
the
latter
are
utterly
incapable
europe
went
to
the
school
of
logical
and
critical
thought
asia
still
fails
to
know
how
to
distinguish
between
truth
and
fiction
and
is
not
conscious
whether
its
convictions
spring
from
individual
observation
and
systematic
thought
or
from
imagination
sense
in
the
school
has
made
europe
what
it
is
in
the
middle
ages
it
was
on
the
road
to
become
once
more
a
part
and
dependent
of
asia
forfeiting
therefore
the
scientific
mind
which
it
owed
to
the
greeks
the
undervalued
effect
of
public
school
the
value
of
a
public
school
is
seldom
sought
in
those
things
which
are
really
learnt
there
and
are
carried
away
never
to
be
lost
but
in
those
things
which
are
learnt
and
which
the
pupil
only
acquires
against
his
will
in
order
to
get
rid
of
them
again
as
soon
as
possible
every
educated
person
acknowledges
that
the
reading
of
the
classics
as
now
practised
is
monstrous
proceeding
carried
on
before
you
people
are
ripe
enough
for
it
by
teachers
who
with
every
word
often
by
their
appearance
alone
throw
a
mildew
on
a
good
author
but
therein
lies
the
value
generally
unrecognised
of
these
teachers
who
speak
abstract
language
of
the
higher
culture
which
though
dry
and
difficult
to
understand
is
yet
a
sort
of
higher
gymnastics
of
the
brain
and
there
is
value
in
the
constant
recurrence
in
their
language
of
ideas
artistic
expressions
methods
and
allusions
which
the
young
people
hardly
ever
hear
in
the
conversations
of
their
relatives
and
in
the
street
even
if
the
pupils
only
their
intellect
is
involuntarily
trained
to
a
scientific
mode
of
regarding
things
it
is
not
possible
to
emerge
from
this
discipline
entirely
untouched
by
its
abstract
character
and
to
remain
a
simple
child
of
nature
learning
many
the
learning
of
many
languages
fills
the
memory
with
words
instead
of
with
facts
and
thoughts
and
this
is
a
vessel
which
with
every
person
can
only
contain
a
certain
limited
amount
of
contents
therefore
the
learning
of
many
languages
is
injurious
inasmuch
as
it
arouses
a
belief
in
possessing
dexterity
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
lends
a
kind
of
delusive
importance
to
social
intercourse
it
is
also
indirectly
injurious
in
that
it
opposes
the
acquirement
of
solid
knowledge
and
the
intention
to
win
the
respect
of
men
in
an
honest
way
finally
it
is
the
axe
which
is
laid
to
the
root
of
a
delicate
sense
of
language
in
our
which
thereby
is
incurably
injured
and
destroyed
the
two
nations
which
produced
the
greatest
stylists
the
greeks
and
the
french
learned
no
foreign
languages
but
as
human
intercourse
must
always
grow
more
cosmopolitan
and
as
for
instance
a
good
merchant
in
london
must
now
be
able
to
read
and
write
eight
languages
the
learning
of
many
tongues
has
certainly
become
a
necessary
evil
but
which
when
finally
carried
to
an
extreme
will
compel
mankind
to
find
a
remedy
and
in
some
future
there
will
be
a
new
language
used
at
first
as
a
language
of
commerce
then
as
a
language
of
intellectual
intercourse
generally
then
for
all
as
surely
as
some
time
or
other
there
will
be
aviation
why
else
should
philology
have
studied
the
laws
of
languages
for
a
whole
century
and
have
estimated
the
necessary
the
valuable
and
the
successful
portion
of
each
separate
language
the
war
history
of
the
in
a
single
human
life
that
passes
through
many
styles
of
culture
we
find
that
struggle
condense
which
would
otherwise
have
been
played
out
between
two
generations
between
father
and
son
the
closeness
of
the
relationship
this
struggle
because
each
party
ruthlessly
drags
in
the
familiar
inward
nature
of
the
other
party
and
thus
this
struggle
in
the
single
individual
becomes
most
here
every
new
phase
disregards
the
earlier
ones
with
cruel
injustice
and
misunderstanding
of
their
means
and
aims
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
mark
is
found
occasionally
whose
views
are
beyond
his
time
but
only
to
such
an
extent
that
he
anticipates
the
common
views
of
the
next
decade
he
possesses
public
opinion
before
it
is
public
that
is
he
has
fallen
into
the
arms
of
a
view
that
deserves
to
be
trivial
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sooner
than
other
people
but
his
fame
is
usually
far
noisier
than
the
fame
of
those
who
are
really
great
and
prominent
the
art
of
every
strong
tendency
is
it
approaches
the
aim
of
the
straight
line
and
like
this
is
exclusive
that
is
it
does
not
touch
many
other
aims
as
do
weak
parties
and
natures
in
their
rolling
it
must
also
be
forgiven
to
philologists
that
they
are
the
restoration
and
keeping
pure
of
texts
besides
their
explanation
carried
on
in
common
for
hundreds
of
years
has
finally
enabled
the
right
methods
to
be
found
the
whole
of
the
middle
ages
was
absolutely
incapable
of
a
strictly
philological
explanation
that
is
of
the
simple
desire
to
comprehend
what
an
author
says
it
an
achievement
finding
these
methods
let
it
not
be
undervalued
through
this
all
science
first
acquired
continuity
and
steadiness
so
that
the
art
of
reading
rightly
which
is
called
philology
attained
its
summit
the
art
of
the
greatest
advance
that
men
have
made
lies
in
their
acquisition
of
the
art
to
it
is
not
so
very
natural
as
schopenhauer
supposes
when
he
says
all
are
capable
of
reasoning
but
few
of
judging
it
is
learnt
late
and
has
not
yet
attained
supremacy
false
conclusion
are
the
rule
in
older
ages
and
the
mythologies
of
all
peoples
their
magic
and
their
superstition
their
religious
cult
and
their
law
are
the
inexhaustible
sources
of
proof
of
this
theory
phases
of
individual
th
strength
and
weakness
of
mental
productiveness
depend
far
less
on
inherited
talents
than
on
the
accompanying
amount
of
most
educated
young
people
of
thirty
turn
round
at
this
solstice
of
their
lives
and
are
afterwards
disinclined
for
new
mental
turnings
therefore
for
the
salvation
of
a
constantly
increasing
culture
a
new
generation
is
immediately
necessary
which
will
not
do
very
much
either
for
in
order
to
come
up
with
the
father
culture
the
son
must
exhaust
almost
all
the
inherited
energy
which
the
father
himself
possessed
at
that
stage
of
life
when
his
son
was
born
with
the
little
addition
he
gets
further
on
for
as
here
the
road
is
being
traversed
for
the
second
time
progress
is
a
little
quicker
in
order
to
learn
that
which
the
father
knew
the
son
does
not
consume
quite
so
much
strength
men
of
great
elasticity
like
goethe
for
instance
get
through
almost
more
than
four
generations
in
succession
would
be
capable
of
but
then
they
advance
too
quickly
so
that
the
rest
of
mankind
only
comes
up
with
them
in
the
next
century
and
even
then
perhaps
not
completely
because
the
exclusiveness
of
culture
and
the
consecutiveness
of
development
have
been
weakened
by
the
frequent
interruptions
men
catch
up
more
quickly
with
the
ordinary
phases
of
intellectual
culture
which
has
been
acquired
in
the
course
of
history
nowadays
they
begin
to
acquire
culture
as
religiously
inclined
children
and
perhaps
about
their
tenth
year
these
sentiments
attain
to
their
highest
point
and
are
then
changed
into
weakened
forms
pantheism
whilst
they
draw
near
to
science
they
entirely
pass
by
god
immortality
and
things
but
are
overcome
by
the
witchcraft
of
a
metaphysical
philosophy
eventually
they
find
even
this
unworthy
of
belief
art
on
the
contrary
seems
to
vouchsafe
more
and
more
so
that
for
a
time
metaphysics
is
metamorphosed
and
continues
to
exist
either
as
a
transition
to
art
or
as
an
artistically
transfiguring
temperament
but
the
scientific
sense
grows
more
imperious
and
conducts
man
to
natural
sciences
and
history
and
particularly
to
the
severest
methods
of
knowledge
whilst
art
has
always
a
milder
and
less
exacting
meaning
all
this
usually
happens
within
the
first
thirty
years
of
a
man
life
it
is
the
recapitulation
of
a
for
which
humanity
had
laboured
perhaps
thirty
thousand
years
retrograded
not
left
whoever
in
the
present
day
still
derives
his
development
from
religious
sentiments
and
perhaps
lives
for
some
length
of
time
afterwards
in
metaphysics
and
art
has
assuredly
gone
back
a
considerable
distance
and
begins
his
race
with
other
modern
men
under
unfavourable
conditions
he
apparently
loses
time
and
space
but
because
he
stays
in
those
domains
where
ardour
and
energy
are
liberated
and
force
flows
continuously
as
a
volcanic
stream
out
of
an
inexhaustible
source
he
goes
forward
all
the
more
quickly
as
soon
as
he
has
freed
himself
at
the
right
moment
from
those
dominators
his
feet
are
winged
his
breast
has
learned
quieter
longer
and
more
enduring
breathing
he
has
only
retreated
in
order
to
have
sufficient
room
to
leap
thus
something
terrible
and
threatening
may
lie
in
this
retrograde
movement
a
portion
of
our
ego
as
an
artistic
it
is
a
sign
of
superior
culture
consciously
to
retain
and
present
a
true
picture
of
certain
phases
of
development
which
commoner
men
live
through
almost
thoughtlessly
and
then
efface
from
the
tablets
of
their
souls
this
is
a
higher
species
of
the
painter
art
which
only
the
few
understand
for
this
it
is
necessary
to
isolate
those
phases
artificially
historical
studies
form
the
qualification
for
this
painting
for
they
constantly
incite
us
in
regard
to
a
portion
of
history
a
people
or
a
human
life
to
imagine
for
ourselves
a
quite
distinct
horizon
of
thoughts
a
certain
strength
of
feelings
the
prominence
of
this
or
the
obscurity
of
that
herein
consists
the
historic
sense
that
out
of
given
instances
we
can
quickly
reconstruct
such
systems
of
thoughts
and
feelings
just
as
we
can
mentally
reconstruct
a
temple
out
of
a
few
pillars
and
remains
of
walls
accidentally
left
standing
the
next
result
is
that
we
understand
our
as
belonging
to
distinct
systems
and
representatives
of
different
cultures
that
is
as
necessary
but
as
changeable
and
again
that
we
can
separate
portions
of
our
own
development
and
put
them
down
independently
cynics
and
the
cynic
recognises
the
connection
between
the
multiplied
and
stronger
pains
of
the
more
highly
cultivated
man
and
the
abundance
of
requirements
he
comprehends
therefore
that
the
multitude
of
opinions
about
what
is
beautiful
suitable
seemly
and
pleasing
must
also
produce
very
rich
sources
of
enjoyment
but
also
of
displeasure
in
accordance
with
this
view
he
educates
himself
backwards
by
giving
up
many
of
these
opinions
and
withdrawing
from
certain
demands
of
culture
he
thereby
gains
a
feeling
of
freedom
and
strength
and
gradually
when
habit
has
made
his
manner
of
life
endurable
his
sensations
of
displeasure
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
rarer
and
weaker
than
those
of
cultivated
people
and
approach
those
of
the
domestic
animal
moreover
he
experiences
everything
with
the
charm
of
contrast
and
he
can
also
scold
to
his
heart
content
so
that
thereby
he
again
rises
high
above
the
of
the
animal
the
epicurean
has
the
same
point
of
view
as
the
cynic
there
is
usually
only
a
difference
of
temperament
between
them
then
the
epicurean
makes
use
of
his
higher
culture
to
render
himself
independent
of
prevailing
opinions
he
raises
himself
above
them
whilst
the
cynic
only
remains
negative
he
walks
as
it
were
in
paths
whilst
over
him
in
the
wind
the
tops
of
the
trees
rustle
and
show
him
how
violently
agitated
is
the
world
out
there
the
cynic
on
the
contrary
goes
as
it
were
naked
into
the
rushing
of
the
wind
and
hardens
himself
to
the
point
of
insensibility
microcosm
and
macrocosm
of
the
best
discoveries
about
culture
man
makes
within
himself
when
he
finds
two
heterogeneous
powers
ruling
therein
supposing
some
one
were
living
as
much
in
love
for
the
plastic
arts
or
for
music
as
he
was
carried
away
by
the
spirit
of
science
and
that
he
were
to
regard
it
as
impossible
for
him
to
end
this
contradiction
by
the
destruction
of
one
and
complete
liberation
of
the
other
power
there
would
therefore
remain
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
erect
around
himself
such
a
large
edifice
of
culture
that
those
two
powers
might
both
dwell
within
it
although
at
different
ends
whilst
between
them
there
dwelt
reconciling
intermediary
powers
with
predominant
strength
to
quell
in
case
of
need
the
rising
conflict
but
such
an
edifice
of
culture
in
the
single
individual
will
bear
a
great
resemblance
to
the
culture
of
entire
periods
and
will
afford
consecutive
analogical
teaching
concerning
it
for
wherever
the
great
architecture
of
culture
manifested
itself
it
was
its
mission
to
compel
opposing
powers
to
agree
by
means
of
an
overwhelming
accumulation
of
other
less
unbearable
powers
without
thereby
oppressing
and
fettering
them
happiness
and
we
are
moved
at
the
sight
of
our
surroundings
the
arbour
the
church
with
its
graves
the
pond
and
the
wood
all
this
we
see
again
with
pain
we
are
seized
with
pity
for
ourselves
for
what
have
we
not
passed
through
since
then
and
everything
here
is
so
silent
so
eternal
only
we
are
so
changed
so
moved
we
even
find
a
few
human
beings
on
whom
time
has
sharpened
his
teeth
no
more
than
on
an
oak
tree
peasants
fishermen
woodmen
they
are
unchanged
emotion
and
at
the
sight
of
lower
culture
is
the
sign
of
higher
culture
from
which
the
conclusion
may
be
drawn
that
happiness
has
certainly
not
been
increased
by
it
whoever
wishes
to
reap
happiness
and
comfort
in
life
should
always
avoid
higher
culture
the
simile
of
the
it
must
now
be
regarded
as
a
decisive
sign
of
great
culture
if
some
one
possesses
sufficient
strength
and
flexibility
to
be
as
pure
and
strict
in
discernment
as
in
other
moments
to
be
capable
of
giving
poetry
religion
and
metaphysics
a
hundred
start
and
then
feeling
their
force
and
beauty
such
a
position
amid
two
such
different
demands
is
very
difficult
for
science
urges
the
absolute
supremacy
of
its
methods
and
if
this
insistence
is
not
yielded
to
there
arises
the
other
danger
of
a
weak
wavering
between
different
impulses
meanwhile
to
cast
a
glance
in
simile
at
least
on
a
solution
of
this
difficulty
it
may
be
remembered
that
is
not
the
same
as
a
dull
reeling
to
and
fro
between
different
impulses
high
culture
will
resemble
a
bold
dance
wherefore
as
has
been
said
there
is
need
of
much
strength
and
suppleness
of
the
relieving
of
a
primary
way
of
lightening
life
is
the
idealisation
of
all
its
occurrences
and
with
the
help
of
painting
we
should
make
it
quite
clear
to
ourselves
what
idealising
means
the
painter
requires
that
the
spectator
should
not
observe
too
closely
or
too
sharply
he
forces
him
back
to
a
certain
distance
from
whence
to
make
his
observations
he
is
obliged
to
take
for
granted
a
fixed
distance
of
the
spectator
from
the
picture
he
must
even
suppose
an
equally
certain
amount
of
sharpness
of
eye
in
his
spectator
in
such
things
he
must
on
no
account
waver
every
one
therefore
who
desires
to
idealise
his
life
must
not
look
at
it
too
closely
and
must
always
keep
his
gaze
at
a
certain
distance
this
was
a
trick
that
goethe
for
instance
understood
aggravation
as
relief
and
much
that
makes
life
more
difficult
in
certain
grades
of
mankind
serves
to
lighten
it
in
a
higher
grade
because
such
people
have
become
familiar
with
greater
aggravations
of
life
the
contrary
also
happens
for
instance
religion
has
a
double
face
according
to
whether
a
man
looks
up
to
it
to
relieve
him
of
his
burden
and
need
or
looks
down
upon
it
fetters
laid
on
him
to
prevent
him
from
soaring
too
high
into
the
air
the
higher
culture
is
necessarily
he
who
has
strung
his
instrument
with
only
two
strings
like
the
scholars
who
besides
the
of
possess
only
an
acquired
instinct
does
not
understand
people
who
can
play
upon
more
strings
it
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
higher
culture
that
it
should
always
be
falsely
interpreted
by
the
lower
an
example
of
this
is
when
art
appears
as
a
disguised
form
of
the
religious
people
who
are
only
religious
understand
even
science
as
a
searching
after
the
religious
sentiment
just
as
deaf
mutes
do
not
know
what
music
is
unless
it
be
visible
movement
it
is
perhaps
the
advantages
of
our
epoch
that
bring
with
them
a
backward
movement
and
an
occasional
undervaluing
of
the
but
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
our
time
is
poor
in
the
matter
of
great
moralists
that
pascal
epictetus
seneca
and
plutarch
are
now
but
little
read
that
work
and
industry
formerly
in
the
following
of
the
great
goddess
health
sometimes
appear
to
rage
like
a
disease
because
time
to
think
and
tranquillity
in
thought
are
lacking
we
no
longer
ponder
over
different
views
but
content
ourselves
with
hating
them
with
the
enormous
acceleration
of
life
mind
and
eye
grow
accustomed
to
a
partial
and
false
sight
and
judgment
and
all
people
are
like
travellers
whose
only
acquaintance
with
countries
and
nations
is
derived
from
the
railway
an
independent
and
cautious
attitude
of
knowledge
is
looked
upon
almost
as
a
kind
of
madness
the
free
spirit
is
brought
into
disrepute
chiefly
through
scholars
who
miss
their
thoroughness
and
industry
in
his
art
of
regarding
things
and
would
gladly
banish
him
into
one
single
corner
of
science
while
it
has
the
different
and
higher
mission
of
commanding
the
battalion
of
scientific
and
learned
men
from
an
isolated
position
and
showing
them
the
ways
and
aims
of
culture
a
song
of
lamentation
such
as
that
which
has
just
been
sung
will
probably
have
its
own
period
and
will
cease
of
its
own
accord
on
a
forcible
return
of
the
genius
of
meditation
the
chief
deficiency
of
active
active
people
are
usually
deficient
in
the
higher
activity
i
mean
individual
activity
they
are
active
as
officials
merchants
scholars
that
is
as
a
species
but
not
as
quite
distinct
separate
and
individuals
in
this
respect
they
are
idle
it
is
the
misfortune
of
the
active
that
their
activity
is
almost
always
a
little
senseless
for
instance
we
must
not
ask
the
banker
the
reason
of
his
restless
activity
it
is
foolish
the
active
roll
as
the
stone
rolls
according
to
the
stupidity
of
mechanics
all
mankind
is
divided
as
it
was
at
all
times
and
is
still
into
slaves
and
freemen
for
whoever
has
not
of
his
day
for
himself
is
a
slave
be
he
otherwise
whatever
he
likes
statesman
merchant
official
or
scholar
in
favour
of
the
as
a
sign
that
the
value
of
a
contemplative
life
has
decreased
scholars
now
vie
with
active
people
in
a
sort
of
hurried
enjoyment
so
that
they
appear
to
value
this
mode
of
enjoying
more
than
that
which
really
pertains
to
them
and
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
a
far
greater
enjoyment
scholars
are
ashamed
of
but
there
is
one
noble
thing
about
idleness
and
idlers
if
idleness
is
really
the
of
all
vice
it
finds
itself
therefore
at
least
in
near
neighbourhood
of
all
the
virtues
the
idle
man
is
still
a
better
man
than
the
active
you
do
not
suppose
that
in
speaking
of
idleness
and
idlers
i
am
alluding
to
you
you
sluggards
modern
modern
restlessness
increases
towards
the
west
so
that
americans
look
upon
the
inhabitants
of
europe
as
altogether
and
enjoying
beings
whilst
in
reality
they
swarm
about
like
wasps
and
bees
this
restlessness
is
so
great
that
the
higher
culture
can
not
mature
its
fruits
it
is
as
if
the
seasons
followed
each
other
too
quickly
for
lack
of
rest
our
civilisation
is
turning
into
a
new
barbarism
at
no
period
have
the
active
that
is
the
restless
been
of
importance
one
of
the
necessary
corrections
therefore
which
must
be
undertaken
in
the
character
of
humanity
is
to
strengthen
the
contemplative
element
on
a
large
scale
but
every
individual
who
is
quiet
and
steady
in
heart
and
head
already
has
the
right
to
believe
that
he
possesses
not
only
a
good
temperament
but
also
a
generally
useful
virtue
and
even
fulfils
a
higher
mission
by
the
preservation
of
this
virtue
to
what
extent
the
active
man
is
i
believe
that
every
one
must
have
his
own
opinion
about
everything
concerning
which
opinions
are
possible
because
he
himself
is
a
peculiar
unique
thing
which
assumes
towards
all
other
things
a
new
and
never
hitherto
existing
attitude
but
idleness
which
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
active
man
soul
prevents
him
from
drawing
water
out
of
his
own
well
freedom
of
opinion
is
like
health
both
are
individual
and
no
good
general
conception
can
be
set
up
of
either
of
them
that
which
is
necessary
for
the
health
of
one
individual
is
the
cause
of
disease
in
another
and
many
means
and
ways
to
the
freedom
of
the
spirit
are
for
more
highly
developed
natures
the
ways
and
means
to
confinement
alternations
of
love
and
hatred
for
a
long
period
distinguish
the
inward
condition
of
a
man
who
desires
to
be
free
in
his
judgment
of
life
he
does
not
forget
and
bears
everything
a
grudge
for
good
and
evil
at
last
when
the
whole
tablet
of
his
soul
is
written
full
of
experiences
he
will
not
hate
and
despise
existence
neither
will
he
love
it
but
will
regard
it
sometimes
with
a
joyful
sometimes
with
a
sorrowful
eye
and
like
nature
will
be
now
in
a
summer
and
now
in
an
autumn
mood
the
secondary
whoever
earnestly
desires
to
be
free
will
therewith
and
without
any
compulsion
lose
all
inclination
for
faults
and
vices
he
will
also
be
more
rarely
overcome
by
anger
and
vexation
his
will
desires
nothing
more
urgently
than
to
discern
and
the
means
to
do
this
that
is
the
permanent
condition
in
which
he
is
best
able
to
discern
the
value
of
the
man
who
is
often
perceives
that
he
is
usually
ill
of
his
position
business
or
society
and
through
them
has
lost
all
he
gains
this
piece
of
knowledge
from
the
idleness
to
which
his
illness
condemns
him
sensitiveness
in
the
if
there
are
no
firm
quiet
lines
on
the
horizon
of
his
life

of
mountain
and
forest

inmost
will
itself
becomes
restless
inattentive
and
covetous
as
is
the
nature
of
a
dweller
in
towns
he
has
no
happiness
and
confers
no
happiness
prudence
of
the
free
those
who
live
by
knowledge
alone
will
soon
attain
the
supreme
aim
of
their
life
and
their
ultimate
position
towards
society
and
state
and
will
gladly
content
themselves
for
instance
with
a
small
post
or
an
income
that
is
just
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
live
for
they
will
arrange
to
live
in
such
a
manner
that
a
great
change
of
outward
prosperity
even
an
overthrow
of
the
political
order
would
not
cause
an
overthrow
of
their
life
to
all
these
things
they
devote
as
little
energy
as
possible
in
order
that
with
their
whole
accumulated
strength
and
with
a
long
breath
they
may
dive
into
the
element
of
knowledge
thus
they
can
hope
to
dive
deep
and
be
able
to
see
the
bottom
such
a
spirit
seizes
only
the
point
of
an
event
he
does
not
care
for
things
in
the
whole
breadth
and
prolixity
of
their
folds
for
he
does
not
wish
to
entangle
himself
in
them
he
too
knows
the
weekdays
of
restraint
of
dependence
and
servitude
but
from
time
to
time
there
must
dawn
for
him
a
sunday
of
liberty
otherwise
he
could
not
endure
life
it
is
probable
that
even
his
love
for
humanity
will
be
prudent
and
somewhat
for
he
desires
to
meddle
with
the
world
of
inclinations
and
of
blindness
only
as
far
as
is
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
knowledge
he
must
trust
that
the
genius
of
justice
will
say
something
for
its
disciple
and
protege
if
accusing
voices
were
to
call
him
poor
in
love
in
his
mode
of
life
and
thought
there
is
a
heroism
which
scorns
to
offer
itself
to
the
great
as
its
coarser
brother
does
and
passes
quietly
through
and
out
of
the
world
whatever
labyrinths
it
traverses
beneath
whatever
rocks
its
stream
has
occasionally
worked
its
way
when
it
reaches
the
light
it
goes
clearly
easily
and
almost
noiselessly
on
its
way
and
lets
the
sunshine
strike
down
to
its
very
bottom
and
thus
forward
upon
the
path
of
wisdom
with
a
firm
step
and
good
confidence
however
you
may
be
situated
serve
yourself
as
a
source
of
experience
throw
off
the
displeasure
at
your
nature
forgive
yourself
your
own
individuality
for
in
any
case
you
have
in
yourself
a
ladder
with
a
hundred
steps
upon
which
you
can
mount
to
knowledge
the
age
into
which
with
grief
you
feel
yourself
thrown
thinks
you
happy
because
of
this
good
fortune
it
calls
out
to
you
that
you
shall
still
have
experiences
which
men
of
later
ages
will
perhaps
be
obliged
to
forego
do
not
despise
the
fact
of
having
been
religious
consider
fully
how
you
have
had
a
genuine
access
to
art
can
you
not
with
the
help
of
these
experiences
follow
immense
stretches
of
former
humanity
with
a
clearer
understanding
is
not
that
ground
which
sometimes
displeases
you
so
greatly
that
ground
of
clouded
thought
precisely
the
one
upon
which
have
grown
many
of
the
most
glorious
fruits
of
older
civilisations
you
must
have
loved
religion
and
art
as
you
loved
mother
and
nurse
otherwise
you
can
not
be
wise
but
you
must
be
able
to
see
beyond
them
to
outgrow
them
if
you
remain
under
their
ban
you
do
not
understand
them
you
must
also
be
familiar
with
history
and
that
cautious
play
with
the
balances
on
the
one
hand
on
the
other
hand
go
back
treading
in
the
footsteps
made
by
mankind
in
its
great
and
painful
journey
through
the
desert
of
the
past
and
you
will
learn
most
surely
whither
it
is
that
all
later
humanity
never
can
or
may
go
again
and
inasmuch
as
you
wish
with
all
your
strength
to
see
in
advance
how
the
knots
of
the
future
are
tied
your
own
life
acquires
the
value
of
an
instrument
and
means
of
knowledge
it
is
within
your
power
to
see
that
all
you
have
experienced
trials
errors
faults
deceptions
passions
your
love
and
your
hope
shall
be
merged
wholly
in
your
aim
this
aim
is
to
become
a
necessary
chain
of
yourself
and
from
this
necessity
to
draw
a
conclusion
as
to
the
necessity
in
the
progress
of
general
culture
when
your
sight
has
become
strong
enough
to
see
to
the
bottom
of
the
dark
well
of
your
nature
and
your
knowledge
it
is
possible
that
in
its
mirror
you
may
also
behold
the
visions
of
future
civilisations
do
you
think
that
such
a
life
with
such
an
aim
is
too
wearisome
too
empty
of
all
that
is
agreeable
then
you
have
still
to
learn
that
no
honey
is
sweeter
than
that
of
knowledge
and
that
the
overhanging
clouds
of
trouble
must
be
to
you
as
an
udder
from
which
you
shall
draw
milk
for
your
refreshment
and
only
when
old
age
approaches
will
you
rightly
perceive
how
you
listened
to
the
voice
of
nature
that
nature
which
rules
the
whole
world
through
pleasure
the
same
life
which
has
its
zenith
in
age
has
also
its
zenith
in
wisdom
in
that
mild
sunshine
of
a
constant
mental
joyfulness
you
meet
them
both
old
age
and
wisdom
upon
one
ridge
of
life
it
was
thus
intended
by
nature
then
it
is
time
and
no
cause
for
anger
that
the
mists
of
death
approach
towards
the
light
is
your
last
movement
a
joyful
cry
of
knowledge
is
your
last
sound

give
them
decided
praise
preference
for
certain
we
set
no
special
value
on
the
possession
of
a
virtue
until
we
perceive
that
it
is
entirely
lacking
in
our
adversary
why
we
we
often
contradict
an
opinion
when
it
is
really
only
the
tone
in
which
it
is
expressed
that
is
unsympathetic
to
us
confidence
and
whoever
proposes
to
command
the
intimacy
of
a
person
is
usually
uncertain
of
possessing
his
confidence
whoever
is
sure
of
a
person
confidence
attaches
little
value
to
intimacy
with
him
the
equilibrium
of
the
right
equilibrium
of
friendship
in
our
relation
to
other
men
is
sometimes
restored
when
we
put
a
few
grains
of
wrong
on
our
own
side
of
the
scales
the
most
dangerous
the
most
dangerous
physicians
are
those
who
like
born
actors
imitate
the
born
physician
with
the
perfect
art
of
imposture
when
paradoxes
are
in
order
to
interest
clever
persons
in
a
theory
it
is
sometimes
only
necessary
to
put
it
before
them
in
the
form
of
a
prodigious
paradox
how
courageous
people
are
won
courageous
people
are
persuaded
to
a
course
of
action
by
representing
it
as
more
dangerous
than
it
really
is
we
regard
the
courtesies
show
us
by
unpopular
persons
as
offences
keeping
people
a
sure
way
of
exasperating
people
and
of
putting
bad
thoughts
into
their
heads
is
to
keep
them
waiting
long
that
makes
them
immoral
against
the
persons
who
give
us
their
full
confidence
think
they
hay
thereby
a
right
to
ours
that
is
a
mistake
people
acquire
no
rights
through
gifts
a
mode
of
it
often
suffices
to
give
a
person
whom
we
have
injured
an
opportunity
to
make
a
joke
about
us
to
give
him
personal
satisfaction
and
even
to
make
him
favourably
disposed
to
us
the
vanity
of
the
whether
man
conceals
his
bad
qualities
and
vices
or
frankly
acknowledges
them
his
vanity
in
either
case
seeks
its
advantage
thereby
only
let
it
be
observed
how
nicely
he
distinguishes
those
from
whom
he
conceals
such
qualities
from
those
with
whom
he
is
frank
and
honest
to
have
no
wish
to
offend
or
injure
any
one
may
as
well
be
the
sign
of
a
just
as
of
a
timid
nature
requisite
for
he
who
can
not
put

not

fain

not

perhaps
merely

who
try
by

be
doubted
whether
a

nothing

are

when
at

of

consists
in
courteously
submitting
to

a
sign
of
the
surest
sign
of
the
estrangement
of

when

danger
in

in

we
are
sometimes
confused
by
the
tone
of

and
misled
to
make
assertions
that
do
not
at
all
correspond
to
our
opinions
in
whether
in
conversation
with
others
we
mostly
agree
or
mostly
disagree
with
them
is
a
matter
of

there
is

in

cases
fear
of

we
are
afraid
of
the
animosity
of

we
are
apprehensive
that

may
thereby
discover
our
secrets

by
highly
respected
persons
distribute
even
their

in
such

that
they
try

therewith

to
remind
us
of
their
serious

in

we
misunderstand

mistaken

though
we
ourselves
know
very
well
the
extent
of
our
divergence
from
a
person
tendency
or
party
those
others
know
us
only
superficially
and
can
therefore
only
hate
us
superficially
we
often
meet
with
goodwill
which
is
inexplicable
to
us
but
when
we
comprehend
it
it
shocks
us
because
it
shows
that
we
are
not

with
sufficient
seriousness
or
importance
thwarting
when
two
persons
meet
whose
vanity
is
equally
great
they
have
afterwards
a
bad
impression
of
each
other
because
each
has
been
so
occupied
with
the
impression
he
wished
to
produce
on
the
other
that
the
other
has
made
no
impression
upon
him
at
last
it
becomes
clear
to
them
both
that
their
efforts
have
been
in
vain
and
each
puts
the
blame
on
the
other
improper
behaviour
as
a
good
a
superior
mind
takes
pleasure
in
the
tactlessness
pretentiousness
and
even
hostility
of
ambitious
youths
it
is
the
vicious
habit
of
fiery
horses
which
have
not
yet
carried
a
rider
but
in
a
short
time
will
be
so
proud
to
carry
one
when
it
is
advisable
to
suffer
it
is
well
to
put
up
with
accusations
without
refutation
even
when
they
injure
us
when
the
accuser
would
see
a
still
greater
fault
on
our
part
if
we
contradicted
and
perhaps
even
refuted
him
in
this
way
certainly
a
person
may
always
be
wronged
and
always
have
right
on
his
side
and
may
eventually
with
the
best
conscience
in
the
world
become
the
most
intolerable
tyrant
and
tormentor
and
what
happens
in
the
individual
may
also
take
place
in
whole
classes
of
society
too
little
very
conceited

who
have
received
less
consideration
than
they
expected
attempt
for
a
long
time
to
deceive
themselves
and
others
with
regard
to
it
and
become
subtle
psychologists
in
order
to
make
out
that
they
have
been
amply
honoured
should
they
not
attain
their
aim
should
the
veil
of
deception
be
torn
they
give
way
to
all
the
greater
fury
primitive
conditions
re
echoing
in
by
the
manner
in
which
people
make
assertions
in
their
intercourse
we
often
recognise
an
echo
of
the
times
when
they
were
more
conversant
with
weapons
than
anything
else
sometimes
they
handle
their
assertions
like
using
their
arms
sometimes
we
think
we
hear
the
whizz
and
clash
of
swords
and
with
some
men
an
assertion
crashes
down
like
a
stout
cudgel
women
on
the
contrary
speak
like
beings
who
for
thousands
of
years
have
sat
at
the
loom
plied
the
needle
or
played
the
child
with
children
the
he
who
gives
an
account
of
something
readily
betrays
whether
it
is
because
the
fact
interests
him
or
because
he
wishes
to
excite
interest
by
the
narration
in
the
latter
case
he
will
exaggerate
employ
superlatives
and
such
like
he
then
does
not
usually
tell
his
story
so
well
because
he
does
not
think
so
much
about
his
subject
as
about
himself
the
he
who
recites
dramatic
works
makes
discoveries
about
his
own
character
he
finds
his
voice
more
natural
in
certain
moods
and
scenes
than
in
others
say
in
the
pathetic
or
in
the
scurrilous
while
in
ordinary
life
perhaps
he
has
not
had
the
opportunity
to
exhibit
pathos
or
scurrility
a
comedy
scene
in
real
some
one
conceives
an
ingenious
idea
on
a
theme
in
order
to
express
it
in
society
now
in
a
comedy
we
should
hear
and
see
how
he
sets
all
sail
for
that
point
and
tries
to
land
the
company
at
the
place
where
he
can
make
his
remark
how
he
continuously
pushes
the
conversation
towards
the
one
goal
sometimes
losing
the
way
finding
it
again
and
finally
arriving
at
the
moment
he
is
almost
breathless
and
then
one
of
the
company
takes
the
remark
itself
out
of
his
mouth
what
will
he
do
oppose
his
own
opinion
unintentionally
when
a
person
treats
another
with
unintentional
discourtesy
for
instance
not
greeting
him
because
not
recognising
him
he
is
vexed
by
it
although
he
can
not
reproach
his
own
sentiments
he
is
hurt
by
the
bad
opinion
which
he
has
produced
in
the
other
person
or
fears
the
consequences
of
his
bad
humour
or
is
pained
by
the
thought
of
having
injured
him
vanity
fear
or
pity
may
therefore
be
aroused
perhaps
all
three
together
a
masterpiece
of
to
express
a
tantalising
distrust
of
a
lest
he
should
betray
one
and
this
at
the
very
moment
when
one
is
practising
treachery
one
self
is
a
masterpiece
of
wickedness
because
it
absorbs
the
other
attention
and
compels
him
for
a
time
to
act
very
unsuspiciously
and
openly
so
that
the
real
traitor
has
thus
acquired
a
free
hand
to
injure
and
to
be
it
is
far
pleasanter
to
injure
and
afterwards
beg
for
forgiveness
than
to
be
injured
and
grant
forgiveness
he
who
does
the
former
gives
evidence
of
power
and
afterwards
of
kindness
of
character
the
person
injured
however
if
he
does
not
wish
to
be
considered
inhuman
forgive
his
enjoyment
of
the
other
humiliation
is
insignificant
on
account
of
this
constraint
in
a
when
we
contradict
another
opinion
and
at
the
same
time
develop
our
own
the
constant
consideration
of
the
other
opinion
usually
disturbs
the
natural
attitude
of
our
own
which
appears
more
intentional
more
distinct
and
perhaps
somewhat
exaggerated
an
he
who
wants
to
get
another
to
do
something
difficult
must
on
no
account
treat
the
matter
as
a
problem
but
must
set
forth
his
plan
plainly
as
the
only
one
possible
and
when
the
adversary
eye
betrays
objection
and
opposition
he
must
understand
how
to
break
off
quickly
and
allow
him
no
time
to
put
in
a
word
pricks
of
conscience
after
social
why
does
our
conscience
prick
us
after
ordinary
social
gatherings
because
we
have
treated
serious
things
lightly
because
in
talking
of
persons
we
have
not
spoken
quite
justly
or
have
been
silent
when
we
should
have
spoken
because
sometimes
we
have
not
jumped
up
and
run
away
in
short
because
we
have
behaved
in
society
as
if
we
belonged
to
it
we
are
he
who
always
listens
to
hear
how
he
is
judged
is
always
vexed
for
we
are
misjudged
even
by
those
who
are
nearest
to
us
who
know
us
best
even
good
friends
sometimes
vent
their
in
a
spiteful
word
and
would
they
be
our
friends
if
they
knew
us
rightly
the
judgments
of
the
indifferent
wound
us
deeply
because
they
sound
so
impartial
so
objective
almost
but
when
we
see
that
some
one
hostile
to
us
knows
us
in
a
concealed
point
as
well
as
we
know
ourselves
how
great
is
then
our
vexation
the
tyranny
of
the
artists
and
statesmen
who
out
of
particular
features
quickly
construct
the
whole
picture
of
a
man
or
an
event
are
mostly
unjust
in
demanding
that
the
event
or
person
should
afterwards
be
actually
as
they
have
painted
it
they
demand
straightway
that
a
man
should
be
just
as
gifted
cunning
and
unjust
as
he
is
in
their
representation
of
him
relatives
as
the
best
the
greeks
who
knew
so
well
what
a
friend
was
they
alone
of
all
peoples
have
a
profound
and
largely
philosophical
discussion
of
friendship
so
that
it
is
by
them
firstly
and
as
yet
lastly
that
the
problem
of
the
friend
has
been
recognised
as
worthy
of
solution
these
same
greeks
have
designated
by
an
expression
which
is
the
superlative
of
the
word
friend
this
is
inexplicable
to
me
misunderstood
when
any
one
quotes
himself
in
conversation
i
then
said
i
am
accustomed
to
say
it
gives
the
impression
of
presumption
whereas
it
often
proceeds
from
quite
an
opposite
source
or
at
least
from
honesty
which
does
not
wish
to
deck
and
adorn
the
present
moment
with
wit
which
belongs
to
an
earlier
moment
the
it
denotes
entire
absence
of
a
noble
disposition
when
a
person
prefers
to
live
in
dependence
at
the
expense
of
others
usually
with
a
secret
bitterness
against
them
in
order
only
that
he
may
not
be
obliged
to
work
such
a
disposition
is
far
more
frequent
in
women
than
in
men
also
far
more
pardonable
for
historical
reasons
on
the
altar
of
there
are
circumstances
under
which
one
can
only
gain
a
point
from
a
person
by
wounding
him
and
becoming
hostile
the
feeling
of
having
a
foe
torments
him
so
much
that
he
gladly
seizes
the
first
indication
of
a
milder
disposition
to
effect
a
reconciliation
and
offers
on
the
altar
of
this
reconciliation
what
was
formerly
of
such
importance
to
him
that
he
would
not
give
it
up
at
any
price
presumption
in
demanding
there
are
people
who
when
they
have
been
in
a
rage
and
have
insulted
others
demand
firstly
that
it
shall
all
be
taken
in
good
part
and
secondly
that
they
shall
be
pitied
because
they
are
subject
to
such
violent
paroxysms
so
far
does
human
presumption
extend
every
man
has
his
price
that
is
not
true
but
perhaps
every
one
can
be
found
a
bait
of
one
kind
or
other
at
which
he
will
snap
thus
in
order
to
gain
some
supporters
for
a
cause
it
is
only
necessary
to
give
it
the
glamour
of
being
philanthropic
noble
charitable
and
and
to
what
cause
could
this
glamour
not
be
given
it
is
the
sweetmeat
and
dainty
of
soul
others
have
different
ones
the
attitude
in
when
good
friends
praise
a
gifted
person
he
often
appears
to
be
delighted
with
them
out
of
politeness
and
goodwill
but
in
reality
he
feels
indifferent
his
real
nature
is
quite
unmoved
towards
them
and
will
not
budge
a
step
on
that
account
out
of
the
sun
or
shade
in
which
it
lies
but
people
wish
to
please
by
praise
and
it
would
grieve
them
if
one
did
not
rejoice
when
they
praise
a
person
the
experience
of
if
one
has
become
a
master
in
one
thing
one
has
generally
remained
precisely
thereby
a
complete
dunce
in
most
other
things
but
one
forms
the
very
reverse
opinion
as
was
already
experienced
by
socrates
this
is
the
annoyance
which
makes
association
with
masters
disagreeable
a
means
of
in
warring
against
stupidity
the
most
just
and
gentle
of
men
at
last
become
brutal
they
are
thereby
perhaps
taking
the
proper
course
for
defence
for
the
most
appropriate
argument
for
a
stupid
brain
is
the
clenched
fist
but
because
as
has
been
said
their
character
is
just
and
gentle
they
suffer
more
by
this
means
of
protection
than
they
injure
their
opponents
by
it
if
curiosity
did
not
exist
very
little
would
be
done
for
the
good
of
our
neighbour
but
curiosity
creeps
into
the
houses
of
the
unfortunate
and
the
needy
under
the
name
of
duty
or
of
pity
perhaps
there
is
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
even
in
the
maternal
love
disappointment
in
one
man
wishes
to
be
interesting
for
his
opinions
another
for
his
likes
and
dislikes
a
third
for
his
acquaintances
and
a
fourth
for
his
solitariness
and
they
all
meet
with
disappointment
for
he
before
whom
the
play
is
performed
thinks
himself
the
only
play
that
is
to
be
taken
into
account
the
it
may
be
said
in
favour
of
duels
and
all
affairs
of
honour
that
if
a
man
has
such
susceptible
feelings
that
he
does
not
care
to
live
when
says
or
thinks
this
or
that
about
him
he
has
a
right
to
make
it
a
question
of
the
death
of
the
one
or
the
other
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
he
is
so
susceptible
it
is
not
at
all
to
be
remonstrated
with
in
that
matter
we
are
the
heirs
of
the
past
of
its
greatness
as
well
as
of
its
exaggerations
without
which
no
greatness
ever
existed
so
when
there
exists
a
code
of
honour
which
lets
blood
stand
in
place
of
death
so
that
the
mind
is
relieved
after
a
regular
duel
it
is
a
great
blessing
because
otherwise
many
human
lives
would
be
in
danger
such
an
institution
moreover
teaches
men
to
be
cautious
in
their
utterances
and
makes
intercourse
with
them
possible
nobleness
and
a
noble
soul
will
be
pleased
to
owe
gratitude
and
will
not
anxiously
avoid
opportunities
of
coming
under
obligation
it
will
also
be
moderate
afterwards
in
the
expression
of
its
gratitude
baser
souls
on
the
other
hand
are
unwilling
to
be
under
any
obligation
or
are
afterwards
immoderate
in
their
expressions
of
thanks
and
altogether
too
devoted
the
latter
is
moreover
also
the
case
with
persons
of
mean
origin
or
depressed
circumstances
to
show
a
favour
seems
to
them
a
miracle
of
grace
occasions
of
in
order
to
talk
well
one
man
needs
a
person
who
is
decidedly
and
avowedly
his
superior
to
talk
to
while
another
can
only
find
absolute
freedom
of
speech
and
happy
turns
of
eloquence
before
one
who
is
his
inferior
in
both
cases
the
cause
is
the
same
each
of
them
talks
well
only
when
he
talks
the
one
because
in
the
presence
of
something
higher
he
does
not
feel
the
impulse
of
rivalry
and
competition
the
other
because
he
also
lacks
the
same
impulse
in
the
presence
of
something
lower
now
there
is
quite
another
type
of
men
who
talk
well
only
when
debating
with
the
intention
of
conquering
which
of
the
two
types
is
the
more
aspiring
the
one
that
talks
well
from
excited
ambition
or
the
one
that
talks
badly
or
not
at
all
from
precisely
the
same
motive
the
talent
for
two
types
are
distinguished
amongst
people
who
have
a
special
faculty
for
friendship
the
one
is
ever
on
the
ascent
and
for
every
phase
of
his
development
he
finds
a
friend
exactly
suited
to
him
the
series
of
friends
which
he
thus
acquires
is
seldom
a
consistent
one
and
is
sometimes
at
variance
and
in
contradiction
entirely
in
accordance
with
the
fact
that
the
later
phases
of
his
development
neutralise
or
prejudice
the
earlier
phases
such
a
man
may
jestingly
be
called
a
the
other
type
is
represented
by
him
who
exercises
an
attractive
influence
on
very
different
characters
and
endowments
so
that
he
wins
a
whole
circle
of
friends
these
however
are
thereby
brought
voluntarily
into
friendly
relations
with
one
another
in
spite
of
all
differences
such
a
man
may
be
called
a
for
this
homogeneousness
of
such
different
temperaments
and
natures
must
somehow
be
typified
in
him
furthermore
the
faculty
for
having
good
friends
is
greater
in
many
people
than
the
faculty
for
being
a
good
friend
tactics
in
after
a
conversation
with
a
person
one
is
best
pleased
with
him
i
when
one
has
had
an
opportunity
of
exhibiting
one
intelligence
and
amiability
in
all
its
glory
shrewd
people
who
wish
to
impress
a
person
favourably
make
use
of
this
circumstance
they
provide
him
with
the
best
opportunities
for
making
a
good
i
joke
and
so
on
in
conversation
an
amusing
conversation
might
be
imagined
between
two
very
shrewd
persons
each
wishing
to
impress
the
other
favourably
and
therefore
each
throwing
to
the
other
the
finest
chances
in
conversation
which
neither
of
them
accepted
so
that
the
conversation
on
the
whole
might
turn
out
spiritless
and
unattractive
because
each
assigned
to
the
other
the
opportunity
of
being
witty
and
charming
discharge
of
the
man
who
meets
with
a
failure
attributes
this
failure
rather
to
the
of
another
than
to
fate
his
irritated
feelings
are
alleviated
by
thinking
that
a
person
and
not
a
thing
is
the
cause
of
his
failure
for
he
can
revenge
himself
on
persons
but
is
obliged
to
swallow
down
the
injuries
of
fate
therefore
when
anything
has
miscarried
with
a
prince
those
about
him
are
accustomed
to
point
out
some
individual
as
the
ostensible
cause
who
is
sacrificed
in
the
interests
of
all
the
courtiers
for
otherwise
the
prince
indignation
would
vent
itself
on
them
all
as
he
can
take
no
revenge
on
the
goddess
of
destiny
herself
assuming
the
colours
of
the
why
are
likes
and
dislikes
so
contagious
that
we
can
hardly
live
near
a
very
sensitive
person
without
being
filled
like
a
hogshead
with
his
and
in
the
first
place
complete
forbearance
of
judgment
is
very
difficult
and
sometimes
absolutely
intolerable
to
our
vanity
it
has
the
same
appearance
as
poverty
of
thought
and
sentiment
or
as
timidity
and
unmanliness
and
so
we
are
at
least
driven
on
to
take
a
side
perhaps
contrary
to
our
environment
if
this
attitude
gives
greater
pleasure
to
our
pride
as
a
rule
however
and
this
is
the
second
point
we
are
not
conscious
of
the
transition
from
indifference
to
liking
or
disliking
but
we
gradually
accustom
ourselves
to
the
sentiments
of
our
environment
and
because
sympathetic
agreement
and
acquiescence
are
so
agreeable
we
soon
wear
all
the
signs
and
of
our
surroundings
irony
is
only
permissible
as
a
pedagogic
expedient
on
the
part
of
a
teacher
when
dealing
with
his
pupils
its
purpose
is
to
humble
and
to
shame
but
in
the
wholesome
way
that
causes
good
resolutions
to
spring
up
and
teaches
people
to
show
honour
and
gratitude
as
they
would
to
a
doctor
to
him
who
has
so
treated
them
the
ironical
man
pretends
to
be
ignorant
and
does
it
so
well
that
the
pupils
conversing
with
him
are
deceived
and
in
their
firm
belief
in
their
own
superior
knowledge
they
grow
bold
and
expose
all
their
weak
points
they
lose
their
cautiousness
and
reveal
themselves
as
they
are
until
all
of
a
sudden
the
light
which
they
have
held
up
to
the
teacher
face
casts
its
rays
back
very
humiliatingly
upon
themselves
where
such
a
relation
as
that
between
teacher
and
pupil
does
not
exist
irony
is
a
rudeness
and
a
vulgar
conceit
all
ironical
writers
count
on
the
silly
species
of
human
beings
who
like
to
feel
ithemselves
superior
to
all
others
in
common
with
the
author
himself
whom
they
look
upon
as
the
mouthpiece
of
their
arrogance
moreover
the
habit
of
irony
like
that
of
sarcasm
spoils
the
character
lit
gradually
fosters
the
quality
of
a
malicious
superiority
one
finally
grows
like
a
snappy
dog
that
has
learnt
to
laugh
as
well
as
to
bite
there
is
nothing
one
should
so
guard
against
as
the
growth
of
the
weed
called
arrogance
which
spoils
all
one
good
harvest
for
there
is
arrogance
in
cordiality
in
showing
honour
in
kindly
familiarity
in
caressing
in
friendly
counsel
in
acknowledgment
of
faults
in
sympathy
for
others
and
all
these
fine
things
arouse
aversion
when
the
weed
in
question
grows
up
among
them
the
arrogant
man
that
is
to
say
he
who
desires
to
appear
more
than
he
is
passes
always
miscalculates
it
is
true
that
he
obtains
a
momentary
success
inasmuch
as
those
with
whom
he
is
arrogant
generally
give
him
the
amount
of
honour
that
he
demands
owing
to
fear
or
for
the
sake
of
convenience
but
they
take
a
bad
revenge
for
it
inasmuch
as
they
subtract
from
the
value
which
they
hitherto
attached
to
him
just
as
much
as
he
demands
above
that
amount
there
is
nothing
for
which
men
ask
to
be
paid
dearer
than
for
humiliation
the
arrogant
man
can
make
his
really
great
merit
so
suspicious
and
small
in
the
eyes
of
others
that
they
tread
on
it
with
dusty
feet
if
at
all
we
should
only
allow
ourselves
a
manner
where
we
are
quite
sure
of
not
being
misunderstood
and
considered
as
arrogant
as
for
instance
with
friends
and
wives
for
in
social
intercourse
there
is
no
greater
folly
than
to
acquire
a
reputation
for
arrogance
it
is
still
worse
than
not
having
learnt
to
deceive
politely
private
conversation
is
the
perfect
conversation
because
everything
the
one
person
says
receives
its
particular
colouring
its
tone
and
its
accompanying
gestures
of
strict
consideration
for
the
other
engaged
in
the
conversation
it
therefore
corresponds
to
what
takes
place
in
intercourse
by
letter
that
one
and
the
same
person
exhibits
ten
kinds
of
psychical
expression
according
as
he
writes
now
to
this
individual
and
now
to
that
one
in
duologue
there
is
only
a
single
refraction
of
thought
the
person
conversed
with
produces
it
as
the
mirror
in
whom
we
want
to
behold
our
thoughts
anew
in
their
finest
form
but
how
is
it
when
there
are
two
or
three
or
even
more
persons
conversing
with
one
conversation
then
necessarily
loses
something
of
its
individualising
subtlety
different
considerations
thwart
and
neutralise
each
other
the
style
which
pleases
one
does
not
suit
the
taste
of
another
in
intercourse
with
several
individuals
a
person
is
therefore
to
withdraw
within
himself
and
represent
facts
as
they
are
but
he
has
also
to
remove
from
the
subjects
the
pulsating
ether
of
humanity
which
makes
conversation
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
in
the
world
listen
only
to
the
tone
in
which
those
who
mingle
with
whole
groups
of
men
are
in
the
habit
of
speaking
it
is
as
if
the
fundamental
base
of
all
speech
were
it
is
i
say
this
so
make
what
you
will
of
it
that
is
the
reason
why
clever
ladies
usually
leave
a
singular
painful
and
forbidding
impression
on
those
who
have
met
them
in
society
it
is
the
talking
to
many
people
before
many
people
that
robs
them
of
all
intellectual
amiability
and
shows
only
their
conscious
dependence
on
themselves
their
tactics
and
their
intention
of
gaining
a
public
victory
in
full
light
whilst
in
a
private
conversation
the
same
ladies
become
womanly
again
and
recover
their
intellectual
grace
and
charm
posthumous
there
is
sense
in
hoping
for
recognition
in
a
distant
future
only
when
we
take
it
for
granted
that
mankind
will
remain
essentially
unchanged
and
that
whatever
is
great
is
not
for
one
age
only
but
will
be
looked
upon
as
great
for
all
time
but
this
is
an
error
in
all
their
sentiments
and
judgments
concerning
what
is
good
and
beautiful
mankind
have
greatly
changed
it
is
mere
fantasy
to
imagine
one
self
to
be
a
mile
ahead
and
that
the
whole
of
mankind
is
coming
way
besides
a
scholar
who
is
misjudged
may
at
present
reckon
with
certainty
that
his
discovery
will
be
made
by
others
and
that
at
best
it
will
be
allowed
to
him
later
on
by
some
historian
that
he
also
already
knew
this
or
that
but
was
not
in
a
position
to
secure
the
recognition
of
his
knowledge
not
to
be
recognised
is
always
interpreted
by
posterity
as
lack
of
power
in
short
one
should
not
so
readily
speak
in
favour
of
haughty
solitude
there
are
however
exceptional
cases
but
it
is
chiefly
our
faults
weakness
and
follies
that
hinder
the
recognition
of
our
great
qualities
of
just
consider
with
thyself
how
different
are
the
feelings
how
divided
are
the
opinions
of
even
the
nearest
acquaintances
how
even
the
same
opinions
in
thy
friend
mind
have
quite
a
different
aspect
and
strength
from
what
they
have
in
thine
own
and
how
manifold
are
the
occasions
which
arise
for
misunderstanding
and
hostile
severance
after
all
this
thou
wilt
say
to
thyself
how
insecure
is
the
ground
upon
which
all
our
alliances
and
friendships
rest
how
liable
to
cold
downpours
and
bad
weather
how
lonely
is
every
creature
when
a
person
recognises
this
fact
and
in
addition
that
all
opinions
and
the
nature
and
strength
of
them
in
his
are
just
as
necessary
and
irresponsible
as
their
actions
when
his
eye
learns
to
see
this
internal
necessity
of
opinions
owing
to
the
indissoluble
interweaving
of
character
occupation
talent
and
environment
he
will
perhaps
get
rid
of
the
bitterness
and
sharpness
of
the
feeling
with
which
the
sage
exclaimed
friends
there
are
no
friends
much
rather
will
he
make
the
confession
to
himself
yes
there
are
friends
but
they
were
drawn
towards
thee
by
error
and
deception
concerning
thy
character
and
they
must
have
learnt
to
be
silent
in
order
to
remain
thy
friends
for
such
human
relationships
almost
always
rest
on
the
fact
that
some
few
things
are
never
said
are
never
indeed
alluded
to
but
if
these
pebbles
are
set
rolling
friendship
follows
afterwards
and
is
broken
are
there
any
who
would
not
be
mortally
injured
if
they
were
to
learn
what
their
most
intimate
friends
really
knew
about
them
by
getting
a
knowledge
of
ourselves
and
by
looking
upon
our
nature
as
a
changing
sphere
of
opinions
and
moods
and
thereby
learning
to
despise
ourselves
a
little
we
recover
once
more
our
equilibrium
with
the
rest
of
mankind
it
is
true
that
we
have
good
reason
to
despise
each
of
our
acquaintances
even
the
greatest
of
them
but
just
as
good
reason
to
turn
this
feeling
against
ourselves
and
so
we
will
bear
with
each
other
since
we
bear
with
ourselves
and
perhaps
there
will
come
to
each
a
happier
hour
when
he
will
exclaim

are

women

perfectly

in

to
maintain

the
aid
of
a
little

antipathy

perhaps
required
many
people

women
never

they

usually
sink

a
marriage
in
which
each
wishes
to
realise
an
individual
aim
by
means
of
the

will
stand
well
for

when
the

the

through

women
actually
become
what
they
appear
to
be
in
the
imagination
of
their
lovers

love
and
to
as
a
rule
women
love
a
distinguished
man
to
the
extent
that
they
wish
to
possess
him
exclusively
they
would
gladly
keep
him
under
lock
and
key
if
their
vanity
did
not
forbid
but
vanity
demands
that
he
should
also
appear
distinguished
before
others
the
test
of
a
good
the
goodness
of
a
marriage
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
it
can
stand

exception

anyone
round
to
one

make
any
person
so
weak
and
weary
by
disquietude
anxiety
and
excess
of
work
or
thought
that
he
no

resists
anything
that
appears
complicated
but
gives
way
to
it
diplomatists
and
women
know
this
propriety
and
those
girls
who
mean
to
trust
exclusively
to
their
youthful
charms
for
their
provision
in
life
and
whose
cunning
is
further
prompted
by
worldly
mothers
have
just
the
same
aims
as
courtesans
only
they
are
wiser
and
less
honest
there
are
women
who
wherever
one
examines
them
have
no
inside
but
are
mere
masks
a
man
is
to
be
pitied
who
has
connection
with
such
almost
and
necessarily
unsatisfactory
creatures
but
it
is
precisely
such
women
who
know
how
to
excite
a
man
desire
most
strongly
he
seeks
for
their
soul
and
seeks
evermore
marriage
as
a
long
in
entering
on
a
marriage
one
should
ask
one
self
the
question
do
you
think
you
will
pass
your
time
well
with
this
woman
till
your
old
age
all
else
in
marriage
is
transitory
talk
however
occupies
most
of
the
time
of
the
association
girlish
inexperienced
girls
flatter
themselves
with
the
notion
that
it
is
in
their
power
to
make
a
man
happy
later
on
they
learn
that
it
is
equivalent
to
underrating
a
man
to
suppose
that
he
needs
only
a
girl
to
make
him
happy
women
vanity
requires
a
man
to
be
something
more
than
merely
a
happy
husband
the
of
faust
and
according
to
the
very
intelligent
remark
of
a
scholar
the
educated
men
of
modern
germany
resemble
somewhat
a
mixture
of
mephistopheles
and
wagner
but
are
not
at
all
like
faust
whom
our
grandfathers
in
their
youth
at
least
felt
agitating
within
them
to
them
therefore
to
continue
the
remark
marguerites
are
not
suited
for
two
reasons
and
because
the
latter
are
no
longer
desired
they
seem
to
be
dying
out
classical
education
for
for
goodness
sake
let
us
not
give
our
classical
education
to
girls
an
education
which
out
of
ingenious
inquisitive
ardent
youths
so
frequently
makes
copies
of
their
teacher
without
women
readily
perceive
in
a
man
whether
his
soul
has
already
been
taken
possession
of
they
wish
to
be
loved
without
rivals
and
find
fault
with
the
objects
of
his
ambition
his
political
tasks
his
sciences
and
arts
if
he
have
a
passion
for
such
things
unless
he
be
distinguished
thereby
then
in
the
case
of
a
between
them
women
look
at
the
same
time
for
an
increase
of
distinction
under
such
circumstances
they
favour
the
lover
the
feminine
the
intellect
of
women
manifests
itself
as
perfect
mastery
presence
of
mind
and
utilisation
of
all
advantages
they
transmit
it
as
a
fundamental
quality
to
their
children
and
the
father
adds
thereto
the
darker
background
of
the
will
his
influence
determines
as
it
were
the
rhythm
and
harmony
with
which
the
new
life
is
to
be
performed
but
its
melody
is
derived
from
the
mother
for
those
who
know
how
to
put
a
thing
properly
women
have
intelligence
men
have
character
and
passion
this
does
not
contradict
the
fact
that
men
actually
achieve
so
much
more
with
their
intelligence
they
have
deeper
and
more
powerful
impulses
and
it
is
these
which
carry
their
understanding
in
itself
something
passive
to
such
an
extent
women
are
often
silently
surprised
at
the
great
respect
men
pay
to
their
character
when
therefore
in
the
choice
of
a
partner
men
seek
specially
for
a
being
of
deep
and
strong
character
and
women
for
a
being
of
intelligence
brilliancy
and
presence
of
mind
it
is
plain
that
at
bottom
men
seek
for
the
ideal
man
and
women
for
the
ideal
woman
consequently
not
for
the
complement
but
for
the
completion
of
their
own
excellence
hesiod
opinion
it
is
a
sign
of
women
wisdom
that
they
have
almost
always
known
how
to
get
themselves
supported
like
drones
in
a
let
us
just
consider
what
this
meant
originally
and
why
men
do
not
depend
upon
women
for
their
support
of
a
truth
it
is
because
masculine
vanity
and
reverence
are
greater
than
feminine
wisdom
for
women
have
known
how
to
secure
for
themselves
by
their
subordination
the
greatest
advantage
in
fact
the
upper
hand
even
the
care
of
children
may
originally
have
been
used
by
the
wisdom
of
women
as
an
excuse
for
withdrawing
themselves
as
much
as
possible
from
work
and
at
present
they
still
understand
when
they
are
really
active
as
for
instance
how
to
make
a
bewildering
fuss
about
it
so
that
the
merit
of
their
activity
is
usually
ten
times
by
men
lovers
as
a
pair
of
powerful
spectacles
has
sometimes
sufficed
to
cure
a
person
in
love
and
whoever
has
had
sufficient
imagination
to
represent
a
face
or
form
twenty
years
older
has
probably
gone
through
life
not
much
disturbed
women
in
in
a
state
of
hatred
women
are
more
dangerous
than
men
for
one
thing
because
they
are
hampered
by
no
regard
for
fairness
when
their
hostile
feelings
have
been
aroused
but
let
their
hatred
develop
unchecked
to
its
utmost
consequences
then
also
because
they
are
expert
in
finding
sore
spots
which
every
man
and
every
party
possess
and
pouncing
upon
them
for
which
purpose
their
intelligence
is
of
good
service
whilst
men
hesitating
at
the
sight
of
wounds
are
often
generously
and
conciliatorily
inclined
the
love
idolatry
which
women
practise
is
fundamentally
and
originally
an
intelligent
device
inasmuch
as
they
increase
their
power
by
all
the
idealisings
of
love
and
exhibit
themselves
as
so
much
the
more
desirable
in
the
eyes
of
men
but
by
being
accustomed
for
centuries
to
this
exaggerated
appreciation
of
love
it
has
come
to
pass
that
they
have
been
caught
in
their
own
net
and
have
forgotten
the
origin
of
the
device
they
themselves
are
now
still
more
deceived
than
the
men
and
on
that
account
also
suffer
more
from
the
disillusionment
which
almost
necessarily
enters
into
the
life
of
every
woman
so
far
at
any
rate
as
she
has
sufficient
imagination
and
intelligence
to
be
able
to
be
deceived
and
undeceived
the
emancipation
of
can
women
be
at
all
just
when
they
are
so
accustomed
to
love
and
to
be
immediately
biased
for
or
against
for
that
reason
they
are
also
less
interested
in
things
and
more
in
individuals
but
when
they
are
interested
in
things
they
immediately
become
their
partisans
and
thereby
spoil
their
pure
innocent
effect
thus
there
arises
a
danger
by
no
means
small
in
entrusting
politics
and
certain
portions
of
science
to
them
history
for
instance
for
what
is
rarer
than
a
woman
who
really
knows
what
science
is
indeed
the
best
of
them
cherish
in
their
breasts
a
secret
scorn
for
science
as
if
they
were
somehow
superior
to
it
perhaps
all
this
can
be
changed
in
time
but
meanwhile
it
is
so
the
inspiration
in
women
the
sudden
decisions
for
or
against
which
women
are
in
the
habit
of
making
the
flashing
illumination
of
personal
relations
caused
by
their
spasmodic
inclinations
and
aversions
in
short
the
proofs
of
feminine
injustice
have
been
invested
with
a
lustre
by
men
who
are
in
love
as
if
all
women
had
inspirations
of
wisdom
even
without
the
delphic
cauldron
and
the
laurel
wreaths
and
their
utterances
are
interpreted
and
duly
set
forth
as
sibylline
oracles
for
long
afterwards
when
one
considers
however
that
for
every
person
and
for
every
cause
something
can
be
said
in
favour
of
it
but
equally
also
something
against
it
that
things
are
not
only
but
also
three
and
it
is
almost
difficult
to
be
entirely
at
fault
in
such
sudden
decisions
indeed
it
might
be
said
that
the
nature
of
things
has
been
so
arranged
that
women
should
always
carry
their
point
being
as
one
of
every
two
persons
in
love
is
usually
the
one
who
loves
the
other
the
one
who
is
loved
the
belief
has
arisen
that
in
every
there
is
a
constant
amount
of
love
and
that
the
more
of
it
the
one
person
monopolises
the
less
is
left
for
the
other
exceptionally
it
happens
that
the
vanity
of
each
of
the
parties
persuades
him
or
her
that
it
is
or
who
must
be
loved
so
that
both
of
them
wish
to
be
loved
from
which
cause
many
half
funny
half
absurd
scenes
take
place
especially
in
married
life
contradictions
in
feminine
owing
to
the
fact
that
women
are
so
much
more
personal
than
objective
there
are
tendencies
included
in
the
range
of
their
ideas
which
are
logically
in
contradiction
to
one
another
they
are
accustomed
in
turn
to
become
enthusiastically
fond
just
of
the
representatives
of
these
tendencies
and
accept
their
systems
in
the
lump
but
in
such
wise
that
a
dead
place
originates
wherever
a
new
personality
afterwards
gets
the
ascendancy
it
may
happen
that
the
whole
philosophy
in
the
mind
of
an
old
lady
consists
of
nothing
but
such
dead
places
who
suffers
the
more
after
a
personal
dissension
and
quarrel
between
a
woman
and
a
man
the
latter
party
suffers
chiefly
from
the
idea
of
having
wounded
the
other
whilst
the
former
suffers
chiefly
from
the
idea
of
not
having
wounded
the
other
sufficiently
so
she
subsequently
endeavours
by
tears
sobs
and
discomposed
mien
to
make
his
heart
heavier
an
opportunity
for
feminine
if
we
could
disregard
the
claims
of
custom
in
our
thinking
we
might
consider
whether
nature
and
reason
do
not
suggest
several
marriages
for
men
one
after
another
perhaps
that
at
the
age
of
he
should
first
marry
an
older
girl
who
is
mentally
and
morally
his
superior
and
can
be
his
leader
through
all
the
dangers
of
the
twenties
ambition
hatred
and
passions
of
all
kinds
this
woman
affection
would
subsequently
change
entirely
into
maternal
love
and
she
would
not
only
submit
to
it
but
would
encourage
the
man
in
the
most
salutary
manner
if
in
his
thirties
he
contracted
an
alliance
with
quite
a
young
girl
whose
education
he
himself
should
take
in
hand
marriage
is
a
necessary
institution
for
the
twenties
a
useful
but
not
necessary
institution
for
the
thirties
for
later
life
it
is
often
harmful
and
promotes
the
mental
deterioration
of
the
man
the
tragedy
of
perhaps
it
not
infrequently
happens
that
noble
men
with
lofty
aims
have
to
fight
their
hardest
battle
in
childhood
by
having
perchance
to
carry
out
their
principles
in
opposition
to
a
father
addicted
to
feigning
and
falsehood
or
living
like
lord
byron
in
constant
warfare
with
a
childish
and
passionate
mother
he
who
has
had
such
an
experience
will
never
be
able
to
forget
all
his
life
who
has
been
his
greatest
and
most
dangerous
enemy
parental
the
grossest
mistakes
in
judging
a
man
are
made
by
his
parents
this
is
a
fact
but
how
is
it
to
be
explained
have
the
parents
too
much
experience
of
the
child
and
can
not
any
longer
arrange
this
experience
into
a
unity
it
has
been
noticed
that
it
is
only
in
the
earlier
period
of
their
sojourn
in
foreign
countries
that
travellers
rightly
grasp
the
general
distinguishing
features
of
a
people
the
better
they
come
to
know
it
they
are
the
less
able
to
see
what
is
typical
and
distinguishing
in
a
people
as
soon
as
they
grow
their
eyes
cease
to
be
do
parents
therefore
judge
their
children
falsely
because
they
have
never
stood
far
enough
away
from
them
the
following
is
quite
another
explanation
people
are
no
longer
accustomed
to
reflect
on
what
is
close
at
hand
and
surrounds
them
but
just
accept
it
perhaps
the
usual
thoughtlessness
of
parents
is
the
reason
why
they
judge
so
wrongly
when
once
they
are
compelled
to
judge
their
children
the
future
of
the
noble
and
women
who
take
as
their
mission
the
education
and
elevation
of
the
female
sex
should
not
overlook
one
point
of
view
marriage
regarded
in
its
highest
aspect
as
the
spiritual
friendship
of
two
persons
of
opposite
sexes
and
accordingly
such
as
is
hoped
for
in
future
contracted
for
the
purpose
of
producing
and
educating
a
new
generation
such
marriage
which
only
makes
use
of
the
sensual
so
to
speak
as
a
rare
and
occasional
means
to
a
higher
purpose
will
it
is
to
be
feared
probably
need
a
natural
auxiliary
namely
for
if
on
the
grounds
of
his
health
the
wife
is
also
to
serve
for
the
sole
satisfaction
of
the
man
sexual
needs
a
wrong
perspective
opposed
to
the
aims
indicated
will
have
most
influence
in
the
choice
of
a
wife
the
aims
referred
to
the
production
of
descendants
will
be
accidental
and
their
successful
education
highly
improbable
a
good
wife
who
has
to
be
friend
helper
mother
and
manager
and
has
even
perhaps
to
conduct
her
own
business
and
affairs
separately
from
those
of
the
husband
can
not
at
the
same
time
be
a
concubine
it
would
in
general
be
asking
too
much
of
her
in
the
future
therefore
a
state
of
things
might
take
place
the
opposite
of
what
existed
at
athens
in
the
time
of
pericles
the
men
whose
wives
were
then
little
more
to
them
than
concubines
turned
besides
to
the
aspasias
because
they
longed
for
the
charms
of
a
companionship
gratifying
both
to
head
and
heart
such
as
the
grace
and
intellectual
suppleness
of
women
could
alone
provide
all
human
institutions
just
like
marriage
allow
only
a
moderate
amount
of
practical
idealising
failing
which
coarse
remedies
immediately
become
necessary
the

and

period
of
in
the
three
or
four

countries

by
several

of

anything
we
like
even
men
not
in
a
sexual
sense
of
course
but
in
every
other
under
such
influences
they
will
acquire
all
the
masculine
virtues
and
forces
at
the
same
time
of
course
they
must
also
have
taken
all
the
masculine
weaknesses
and
vices
into
the
bargain
so
much
as
has
been
said
we
can
i
command
but
how
shall
we
endure
the
intermediate
state
thereby
induced
which
may
even
last
two
or
three
centuries
during
which
feminine
follies
and
injustices
woman
original
birthday
endowment
will
still
maintain
the
ascendancy
over
all
that
has
been
otherwise
gained
and
acquired
this
will
be
the
time
when
indignation
will
be
the
peculiar
masculine
passion
indignation
because
all
arts
and
sciences
have
been
overflowed
and
choked
by
an
unprecedented
dilettanteism
philosophy
talked
to
death
by
chatter
politics
more
fantastic
and
partisan
than
ever
and
society
in
complete
disorganisation
because
the
conservatrices
of
ancient
customs
have
become
ridiculous
to
themselves
and
have
endeavoured
in
every
way
to
place
themselves
outside
the
pale
of
custom
if
indeed
women
had
their
greatest
power
in
custom
where
will
they
have
to
look
in
order
to
reacquire
a
similar
plenitude
of
power
after
having
renounced
custom
and
will
live
with
women
in
general
i
think
that
like
the
prophesying
birds
of
old
like
the
and
of
the
present
they
must
prefer

the
happiness
of
everything
to
which
we
are
accustomed
draws
an
around
us
and
presently
we
notice
that
the
threads
have
become
cords
and
that
we
ourselves
sit
in
the
middle
like
a
spider
that
has
here
got
itself
caught
and
must
feed
on
its
own
blood
hence
the
free
spirit
hates
all
rules
and
customs
all
that
is
permanent
and
definitive
hence
he
painfully
tears
asunder
again
and
again
the
net
around
him
though
in
consequence
thereof
he
will
suffer
from
numerous
wounds
slight
and
severe
for
he
must
break
off
every
thread
himself
from
his
body
and
soul
he
must
learn
to
love
where
he
has
hitherto
hated
and
indeed
it
must
not
be
a
thing
impossible
for
him
to
sow
dragon
teeth
in
the
same
field
in
which
he
formerly
scattered
the
abundance
of
his
bounty
from
this
it
can
be
inferred
whether
he
is
suited
for
the
happiness
of
marriage
too
when
we
live
on
too
intimate
terms
with
a
person
it
is
as
if
we
were
again
and
again
handling
a
good
engraving
with
our
fingers
the
time
comes
when
we
have
soiled
and
damaged
paper
in
our
hands
and
nothing
more
a
man
soul
also
gets
worn
out
by
constant
handling
at
least
it
eventually
so
to
us
never
again
do
we
see
its
original
design
and
beauty
we
always
lose
through
too
familiar
association
with
women
and
friends
and
sometimes
we
lose
the
pearl
of
our
life
thereby
the
golden
the
free
spirit
will
always
feel
relieved
when
he
has
finally
resolved
to
shake
off
the
motherly
care
and
guardianship
with
which
women
surround
him
what
harm
will
a
rough
wind
from
which
he
has
been
so
anxiously
protected
do
him
of
what
consequence
is
a
genuine
disadvantage
loss
misfortune
sickness
illness
fault
or
folly
more
or
less
in
his
life
compared
with
the
bondage
of
the
golden
cradle
the
fan
and
the
oppressive
feeling
that
he
must
in
addition
be
grateful
because
he
is
waited
on
and
spoiled
like
a
baby
hence
it
is
that
the
milk
which
is
offered
him
by
the
motherly
disposition
of
the
women
about
him
can
so
readily
turn
into
gall
a
voluntary
there
is
nothing
by
which
able
women
can
so
alleviate
the
lives
of
their
husbands
should
these
be
great
and
famous
as
by
becoming
so
to
speak
the
receptacle
for
the
general
disfavour
and
occasional
of
the
rest
of
mankind
contemporaries
are
usually
accustomed
to
overlook
many
mistakes
follies
and
even
flagrant
injustices
in
their
great
men
if
only
they
can
find
some
one
to
maltreat
and
kill
as
a
proper
victim
for
the
relief
of
their
feelings
a
wife
not
infrequently
has
the
ambition
to
present
herself
for
this
sacrifice
and
then
the
husband
may
indeed
feel
satisfied
he
being
enough
of
an
egoist
to
have
such
a
voluntary
storm
rain
and
beside
him
agreeable
the
natural
inclination
of
women
towards
quiet
regular
happily
tuned
existences
and
intercourse
the
and
calming
effect
of
their
influence
upon
the
sea
of
life
operates
unconsciously
against
the
heroic
inner
impulse
of
the
free
spirit
without
knowing
it
women
act
as
if
they
were
taking
away
the
stones
from
the
path
of
the
wandering
mineralogist
in
order
that
he
might
not
strike
his
foot
against
them
when
he
has
gone
out
for
the
very
purpose
of
striking
against

the

the

socrates
found
a
wife
such
as
he
required
but
he
would
not
have
sought
her
had
he
known
her
sufficiently
well
even
the
heroism
of
his
free
spirit
would
not
have
gone
so
far
as
a
matter
of
fact
xantippe
forced
him
more
and
more
into
his
peculiar
profession
inasmuch
as
she
made
house
and
home
doleful
and
dismal
to
him
she
taught
him
to
live
in
the
streets
and
wherever
gossiping
and
idling
went
on
and
thereby
made
him
the
greatest
athenian
who
had
at
last
to
compare
himself
to
a
which
a
god
had
set
on
the
neck
of
the
beautiful
horse
athens
to
prevent
it
from
resting
blind
to
the
just
as
mothers
have
senses
and
eye
only
for
those
pains
of
their
children
that
are
evident
to
the
senses
and
eye
so
the
wives
of
men
of
high
aspirations
can
not
accustom
themselves
to
see
their
husbands
suffering
starving
or
slighted
although
all
this
is
perhaps
not
only
the
proof
that
they
have
rightly
chosen
their
attitude
in
life
but
even
the
guarantee
that
their
great
aims
be
achieved
some
time
women
always
intrigue
privately
against
the
higher
souls
of
their
husbands
they
want
to
cheat
them
out
of
their
future
for
the
sake
of
a
painless
and
comfortable
present
authority
and
however
highly
women
may
honour
their
husbands
they
honour
still
more
the
powers
and
ideas
recognised
by
society
they
have
been
accustomed
for
millennia
to
go
along
with
their
hands
folded
on
their
breasts
and
their
heads
bent
before
everything
dominant
disapproving
of
all
resistance
to
public
authority
they
therefore
unintentionally
and
as
if
from
instinct
hang
themselves
as
a
drag
on
the
wheels
of
independent
endeavour
and
in
certain
circumstances
make
their
husbands
highly
impatient
especially
when
the
latter
persuade
themselves
that
it
is
really
love
which
prompts
the
action
of
their
wives
to
disapprove
of
women
methods
and
generously
to
honour
the
motives
that
prompt
them
that
is
man
nature
and
often
enough
his
despair
it
is
laughable
when
a
company
of
paupers
decree
the
abolition
of
the
right
of
inheritance
and
it
is
not
less
laughable
when
childless
persons
labour
for
the
practical
of
a
country
they
have
not
enough
ballast
in
their
ship
to
sail
safely
over
the
ocean
of
the
future
but
it
seems
equally
senseless
if
a
man
who
has
chosen
for
his
mission
the
widest
knowledge
and
estimation
of
universal
existence
burdens
himself
with
personal
considerations
for
a
family
with
the
support
protection
and
care
of
wife
and
child
and
in
front
of
his
telescope
hangs
that
gloomy
veil
through
which
hardly
a
ray
from
the
distant
firmament
can
penetrate
thus
i
too
agree
with
the
opinion
that
in
matters
of
the
highest
philosophy
all
married
men
are
to
be
suspected
there
are
many
kinds
of
hemlock
and
fate
generally
finds
an
opportunity
to
put
a
cup
of
this
poison
to
the
lips
of
the
free
spirit
in
order
to
punish
him
as
every
one
then
says
what
do
the
women
do
about
him
then
they
cry
and
lament
and
perhaps
disturb
the
of
the
thinker
as
they
did
in
the
prison
at
athens
oh
crito
bid
some
one
take
those
women
away
said
socrates
at
last
footnote
the
opposite
of
this
aphorism
also
holds
footnote
it
may
be
remarked
that
nietzsche
changed
his
view
on
this
subject
later
on
and
ascribed
more
importance
to
intuition
cf
also
disraeli
reference
to
the
high
priestesses
of

division
a
glance
at
the
state
asking
to
be
the
demagogic
disposition
and
the
intention
of
working
upon
the
masses
is
at
present
common
to
all
political
parties
on
this
account
they
are
all
obliged
to
change
their
principles
into
great
follies
and
thus
make
a
show
of
them
in
this
matter
there
is
no
further
alteration
to
be
made
indeed
it
is
superfluous
even
to
raise
a
finger
against
it
for
here
voltaire
saying
applies
la
populace
se
mêle
de
raisonner
tout
est
perdu
since
this
has
happened
we
have
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
new
conditions
as
we
have
to
accommodate
ourselves
when
an
earthquake
has
displaced
the
old
boundaries
and
the
contour
of
the
land
and
altered
the
value
of
property
moreover
when
it
is
once
for
all
a
question
in
the
politics
of
all
parties
to
make
life
endurable
to
the
greatest
possible
majority
this
majority
may
always
decide
what
they
understand
by
an
endurable
life
if
they
believe
their
intellect
capable
of
finding
the
right
means
to
this
end
why
should
we
doubt
about
it
they
once
for
all
to
be
the
architects
of
their
own
good
or
ill
fortune
and
if
their
feeling
of
free
choice
and
their
pride
in
the
five
or
six
ideas
that
their
brain
conceals
and
brings
to
light
really
makes
life
so
agreeable
to
them
that
they
gladly
put
up
with
the
fatal
consequences
of
their
there
is
little
to
object
to
provided
that
their
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
demand
that
shall
become
politics
in
this
sense
that
shall
live
and
act
according
to
this
standard
for
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
more
than
ever
permissible
for
some
people
to
keep
aloof
from
politics
and
to
stand
somewhat
aside
to
this
they
are
also
impelled
by
the
pleasure
of
free
choice
and
connected
with
this
there
may
even
be
some
little
pride
in
keeping
silence
when
too
many
and
only
the
many
are
speaking
then
this
small
group
must
be
excused
if
they
do
not
attach
such
great
importance
to
the
happiness
of
the
majority
nations
or
strata
of
population
may
be
understood
thereby
and
are
occasionally
guilty
of
an
ironical
grimace
for
their
seriousness
lies
elsewhere
their
conception
of
happiness
is
quite
different
and
their
aim
can
not
be
encompassed
by
every
clumsy
hand
that
has
just
five
fingers
finally
there
comes
from
time
to
time
what
is
certainly
most
difficult
to
concede
to
them
but
must
also
be
conceded
a
moment
when
they
emerge
from
their
silent
solitariness
and
try
once
more
the
strength
of
their
lungs
they
then
call
to
each
other
like
people
lost
in
a
wood
to
make
themselves
known
and
for
mutual
encouragement
whereby
to
be
sure
much
becomes
audible
that
sounds
evil
to
ears
for
which
it
is
not
intended
soon
however
silence
again
prevails
in
the
wood
such
silence
that
the
buzzing
humming
and
fluttering
of
the
countless
insects
that
live
in
above
and
beneath
it
are
again
plainly
heard
culture
and
a
higher
culture
can
only
originate
where
there
are
two
distinct
castes
of
society
that
of
the
working
class
and
that
of
the
leisured
class
who
are
capable
of
true
leisure
or
more
strongly
expressed
the
caste
of
compulsory
labour
and
the
caste
of
free
labour
the
point
of
view
of
the
division
of
happiness
is
not
essential
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
production
of
a
higher
culture
in
any
case
however
the
leisured
caste
is
more
susceptible
to
suffering
and
suffer
more
their
pleasure
in
existence
is
less
and
their
task
is
greater
now
supposing
there
should
be
quite
an
interchange
between
the
two
castes
so
that
on
the
one
hand
the
duller
and
less
intelligent
families
and
individuals
are
lowered
from
the
higher
caste
into
the
lower
and
on
the
other
hand
the
freer
men
of
the
lower
caste
obtain
access
to
the
higher
a
condition
of
things
would
be
attained
beyond
which
one
can
only
perceive
the
open
sea
of
vague
wishes
thus
speaks
to
us
the
vanishing
voice
of
the
olden
time
but
where
are
there
still
ears
to
hear
it
of
good
that
which
men
and
women
of
good
blood
possess
much
more
than
others
and
which
gives
them
an
undoubted
right
to
be
more
highly
appreciated
are
two
arts
which
are
always
increased
by
inheritance
the
art
of
being
able
to
command
and
the
art
of
proud
obedience
now
wherever
commanding
is
the
business
of
the
day
as
in
the
great
world
of
commerce
and
industry
there
results
something
similar
to
these
families
of
good
blood
only
the
noble
bearing
in
obedience
is
lacking
which
is
an
inheritance
from
feudal
conditions
and
hardly
grows
any
longer
in
the
climate
of
our
culture
the
subordination
which
is
so
highly
valued
in
military
and
official
ranks
will
soon
become
as
incredible
to
us
as
the
secret
tactics
of
the
jesuits
have
already
become
and
when
this
subordination
is
no
longer
possible
a
multitude
of
astonishing
results
will
no
longer
be
attained
and
the
world
will
be
all
the
poorer
it
must
disappear
for
its
foundation
is
disappearing
the
belief
in
unconditional
authority
in
ultimate
truth
even
in
military
ranks
physical
compulsion
is
not
sufficient
to
produce
it
but
only
the
inherited
adoration
of
the
princely
as
of
something
superhuman
in
circumstances
people
subordinate
themselves
only
on
conditions
in
compliance
with
a
mutual
contract
consequently
with
all
the
provisos
of
the
national
the
greatest
disadvantage
of
the
national
army
now
so
much
glorified
lies
in
the
squandering
of
men
of
the
highest
civilisation
it
is
only
by
the
favourableness
of
all
circumstances
that
there
are
such
men
at
all
how
carefully
and
anxiously
should
we
deal
with
them
since
long
periods
are
required
to
create
the
chance
conditions
for
the
production
of
such
delicately
organised
brains
but
as
the
greeks
wallowed
in
the
blood
of
greeks
so
do
europeans
now
in
the
blood
of
europeans
and
indeed
taken
relatively
it
is
mostly
the
highly
cultivated
who
are
sacrificed
those
who
promise
an
abundant
and
excellent
posterity
for
such
stand
in
the
front
of
the
battle
as
commanders
and
also
expose
themselves
to
most
danger
by
reason
of
their
higher
ambition
at
present
when
quite
other
and
higher
tasks
are
assigned
than
and
the
rough
roman
patriotism
is
either
something
dishonourable
or
a
sign
of
being
behind
the
times
hope
as
our
social
order
will
slowly
melt
away
as
all
former
orders
have
done
as
soon
as
the
suns
of
new
opinions
have
shone
upon
mankind
with
a
new
glow
we
can
only
this
melting
away
in
the
hope
thereof
and
we
are
only
reasonably
entitled
to
hope
when
we
believe
that
we
and
our
equals
have
more
strength
in
heart
and
head
than
the
representatives
of
the
existing
state
of
things
as
a
rule
therefore
this
hope
will
be
a
presumption
an
against
war
it
may
be
said
that
it
makes
the
victor
stupid
and
the
vanquished
revengeful
in
favour
of
war
it
may
be
said
that
it
barbarises
in
both
its
results
and
thereby
makes
more
natural
it
is
the
sleep
or
the
winter
period
of
culture
man
emerges
from
it
with
greater
strength
for
good
and
for
evil
in
the
prince
to
be
able
to
act
quite
regardlessly
it
is
best
for
a
statesman
to
carry
out
his
work
not
for
himself
but
for
a
prince
the
eye
of
the
spectator
is
dazzled
by
the
splendour
of
this
general
disinterestedness
so
that
it
does
not
see
the
malignancy
and
severity
which
the
work
of
a
statesman
brings
with
it
a
question
of
power
not
of
as
regards
socialism
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
always
consider
higher
utility
if
it
is
a
rising
against
their
oppressors
of
those
who
for
centuries
have
been
oppressed
and
downtrodden
there
is
no
problem
of
involved
notwithstanding
the
ridiculous
effeminate
question
how
far
we
to
grant
its
demands
but
only
a
problem
of
the
same
therefore
as
in
the
case
of
a
natural
force
steam
for
instance
which
is
either
forced
by
man
into
his
service
as
a
or
which
in
case
of
defects
of
the
machine
that
is
to
say
defects
of
human
calculation
in
its
construction
destroys
it
and
man
together
in
order
to
solve
this
question
of
power
we
must
know
how
strong
socialism
is
in
what
modification
it
may
yet
be
employed
as
a
powerful
lever
in
the
present
mechanism
of
political
forces
under
certain
circumstances
we
should
do
all
we
can
to
strengthen
it
with
every
great
force
be
it
the
most
dangerous
men
have
to
think
how
they
can
make
of
it
an
instrument
for
their
purposes
socialism
acquires
a
only
if
war
seems
to
have
taken
place
between
the
two
powers
the
representatives
of
the
old
and
the
new
when
however
a
wise
calculation
of
the
greatest
possible
preservation
and
advantageousness
to
both
sides
gives
rise
to
a
desire
for
a
treaty
without
treaty
no
right
so
far
however
there
is
neither
war
nor
treaty
on
the
ground
in
question
therefore
no
rights
no
ought
utilising
the
most
trivial
the
power
of
the
press
consists
in
the
fact
that
every
individual
who
ministers
to
it
only
feels
himself
bound
and
constrained
to
a
very
small
extent
he
usually
expresses
opinion
but
sometimes
also
does
express
it
in
order
to
serve
his
party
or
the
politics
of
his
country
or
even
himself
such
little
faults
of
dishonesty
or
perhaps
only
of
a
dishonest
silence
are
not
hard
to
bear
by
the
individual
but
the
consequences
are
extraordinary
because
these
little
faults
are
committed
by
many
at
the
same
time
each
one
says
to
himself
for
such
small
concessions
i
live
better
and
can
make
my
income
by
the
want
of
such
little
compliances
i
make
myself
impossible
because
it
seems
almost
morally
indifferent
to
write
a
line
more
perhaps
even
without
signature
or
not
to
write
it
a
person
who
has
money
and
influence
can
make
any
opinion
a
public
one
he
who
knows
that
most
people
are
weak
in
trifles
and
wishes
to
attain
his
own
ends
thereby
is
always
dangerous
too
loud
a
tone
in
through
the
fact
that
an
account
of
a
bad
state
of
things
for
instance
the
crimes
of
an
administration
bribery
and
arbitrary
favour
in
political
or
learned
bodies
is
greatly
exaggerated
it
fails
in
its
effect
on
intelligent
people
but
has
all
the
greater
effect
on
the
unintelligent
who
would
have
remained
indifferent
to
an
accurate
and
moderate
account
but
as
these
latter
are
considerably
in
the
majority
and
harbour
in
themselves
stronger
and
more
impatient
desire
for
action
the
exaggeration
becomes
the
cause
of
investigations
punishments
promises
and
reorganisations
in
so
far
it
is
useful
to
exaggerate
the
accounts
of
bad
states
of
things
the
apparent
weather
makers
of
just
as
people
tacitly
assume
that
he
who
understands
the
weather
and
foretells
it
about
a
day
in
advance
makes
the
weather
so
even
the
educated
and
learned
with
a
display
of
superstitious
faith
ascribe
to
great
statesmen
as
their
most
special
work
all
the
important
changes
and
conjunctures
that
have
taken
place
during
their
administration
when
it
is
only
evident
that
they
knew
something
thereof
a
little
earlier
than
other
people
and
made
their
calculations
accordingly
thus
they
are
also
looked
upon
as
and
this
belief
is
not
the
least
important
instrument
of
their
power
new
and
old
conceptions
of
to
draw
such
a
distinction
between
government
and
people
as
if
two
separate
spheres
of
power
a
stronger
and
higher
and
a
weaker
and
lower
negotiated
and
came
to
terms
with
each
other
is
a
remnant
of
transmitted
political
sentiment
which
still
accurately
represents
the
historic
establishment
of
the
conditions
of
power
in
states
when
bismarck
for
instance
describes
the
constitutional
system
as
a
compromise
between
government
and
people
he
speaks
in
accordance
with
a
principle
which
has
its
reason
in
history
from
whence
to
be
sure
it
also
derives
its
admixture
of
folly
without
which
nothing
human
can
exist
on
the
other
hand
we
must
now
learn
in
accordance
with
a
principle
which
has
originated
only
in
the
and
has
still
to
history
that
government
is
nothing
but
an
organ
of
the
people
not
an
attentive
honourable
higher
in
relation
to
a
lower
accustomed
to
modesty
before
we
accept
this
hitherto
unhistorical
and
arbitrary
although
logical
formulation
of
the
conception
of
government
let
us
but
consider
its
consequences
for
the
relation
between
people
and
government
is
the
strongest
typical
relation
after
the
pattern
of
which
the
relationship
between
teacher
and
pupil
master
and
servants
father
and
family
leader
and
soldier
master
and
apprentice
is
unconsciously
formed
at
present
under
the
influence
of
the
prevailing
constitutional
system
of
government
all
these
relationships
are
changing
a
little
they
are
becoming
compromises
but
how
they
will
have
to
be
reversed
and
shifted
and
change
name
and
nature
when
that
newest
of
all
conceptions
has
got
the
upper
hand
everywhere
in
minds
to
achieve
which
however
a
century
may
yet
be
required
in
this
matter
there
is
nothing
to
be
wished
for
except
caution
and
slow
development
justice
as
the
of
well
may
noble
if
not
exactly
very
intelligent
representatives
of
the
governing
classes
asseverate
we
will
treat
men
equally
and
grant
them
equal
rights
so
far
a
socialistic
mode
of
thought
which
is
based
on
is
possible
but
as
has
been
said
only
within
the
ranks
of
the
governing
class
which
in
this
case
justice
with
sacrifices
and
abnegations
on
the
other
hand
to
equality
of
rights
as
do
the
socialists
of
the
subject
caste
is
by
no
means
the
outcome
of
justice
but
of
covetousness
if
you
expose
bloody
pieces
of
flesh
to
a
beast
and
withdraw
them
again
until
it
finally
begins
to
roar
do
you
think
that
roaring
implies
justice
possession
and
when
the
socialists
point
out
that
the
division
of
property
at
the
present
day
is
the
consequence
of
countless
deeds
of
injustice
and
violence
and
summa
repudiate
obligation
to
anything
with
so
unrighteous
a
basis
they
only
perceive
something
isolated
the
entire
past
of
ancient
civilisation
is
built
up
on
violence
slavery
deception
and
error
we
however
can
not
annul
ourselves
the
heirs
of
all
these
conditions
nay
the
concrescences
of
all
this
past
and
are
not
entitled
to
demand
the
withdrawal
of
a
single
fragment
thereof
the
unjust
disposition
lurks
also
in
the
souls
of
they
are
not
better
than
the
possessors
and
have
no
moral
prerogative
for
at
one
time
or
another
their
ancestors
have
been
possessors
not
forcible
new
distributions
but
gradual
transformations
of
opinion
are
necessary
justice
in
all
matters
must
become
greater
the
instinct
of
violence
weaker
the
helmsman
of
the
the
statesman
excites
public
passions
in
order
to
have
the
advantage
of
the
thereby
aroused
to
give
an
example
a
german
statesman
knows
quite
well
that
the
catholic
church
will
never
have
the
same
plans
as
russia
indeed
that
it
would
far
rather
be
allied
with
the
turk
than
with
the
former
country
he
likewise
knows
that
germany
is
threatened
with
great
danger
from
an
alliance
between
france
and
russia
if
he
can
succeed
therefore
in
making
france
the
focus
and
fortress
of
the
catholic
church
he
has
averted
this
danger
for
a
lengthy
period
he
has
accordingly
an
interest
in
showing
hatred
against
the
catholics
in
transforming
by
all
kinds
of
hostility
the
supporters
of
the
pope
authority
into
an
impassioned
political
power
which
is
opposed
to
german
politics
and
must
as
a
matter
of
course
coalesce
with
france
as
the
adversary
of
germany
his
aim
is
the
catholicising
of
france
just
as
necessarily
as
mirabeau
saw
the
salvation
of
his
native
land
in
it
the
one
state
therefore
desires
to
muddle
millions
of
minds
of
another
state
in
order
to
gain
advantage
thereby
it
is
the
same
disposition
which
supports
the
republican
form
of
government
of
a
neighbouring
state
désordre
organisé
as
mérimée
says
for
the
sole
reason
that
it
assumes
that
this
form
of
government
makes
the
nation
weaker
more
distracted
less
fit
for
war
the
dangerous
revolutionary
those
who
are
bent
on
revolutionising
society
may
be
divided
into
those
who
seek
something
for
themselves
thereby
and
those
who
seek
something
for
their
children
and
grandchildren
the
latter
are
the
more
dangerous
for
they
have
the
belief
and
the
good
conscience
of
disinterestedness
the
others
can
be
appeased
by
favours
those
in
power
are
still
sufficiently
rich
and
wise
to
adopt
that
expedient
the
danger
begins
as
soon
as
the
aims
become
impersonal
revolutionists
seeking
impersonal
interests
may
consider
all
defenders
of
the
present
state
of
things
as
personally
interested
and
may
therefore
feel
themselves
superior
to
their
opponents
the
political
value
of
when
a
man
has
no
sons
he
has
not
a
full
right
to
join
in
a
discussion
concerning
the
needs
of
a
particular
community
a
person
must
himself
have
staked
his
dearest
object
along
with
the
others
that
alone
binds
him
fast
to
the
state
he
must
have
in
view
the
of
his
descendants
and
must
therefore
above
all
have
descendants
in
order
to
take
a
right
and
natural
share
in
all
institutions
and
the
changes
thereof
the
development
of
higher
morality
depends
on
a
person
having
sons
it
disposes
him
to
be
or
more
correctly
it
extends
his
egoism
in
its
duration
and
permits
him
earnestly
to
strive
after
goals
which
lie
beyond
his
individual
lifetime
pride
of
a
man
may
be
justly
proud
of
an
unbroken
line
of
ancestors
down
to
his
father
not
however
of
the
line
itself
for
every
one
has
that
descent
from
good
ancestors
constitutes
the
real
nobility
of
birth
a
single
break
in
the
chain
one
bad
ancestor
therefore
destroys
the
nobility
of
birth
every
one
who
talks
about
his
nobility
should
be
asked
have
you
no
violent
avaricious
dissolute
wicked
cruel
man
amongst
your
ancestors
if
with
good
cognisance
and
conscience
he
can
answer
no
then
let
his
friendship
be
sought
slaves
and
the
fact
that
we
regard
the
gratification
of
vanity
as
of
more
account
than
all
other
forms
of
security
position
and
pleasures
of
all
sorts
is
shown
to
a
ludicrous
extent
by
every
one
wishing
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
utterly
abhorring
to
put
any
one
into
this
position
apart
altogether
from
political
reasons
while
every
one
must
acknowledge
to
himself
that
in
all
respects
slaves
live
more
securely
and
more
happily
than
modern
labourers
and
that
slave
labour
is
very
easy
labour
compared
with
that
of
the
labourer
we
protest
in
the
name
of
the
dignity
of
man
but
expressed
more
simply
that
is
just
our
darling
vanity
which
feels
and
inferiority
in
public
estimation
to
be
the
hardest
lot
of
all
the
cynic
thinks
differently
concerning
the
matter
because
he
despises
honour
and
so
diogenes
was
for
some
time
a
slave
and
tutor
leading
minds
and
their
we
see
that
great
statesmen
and
in
general
all
who
have
to
employ
many
people
to
carry
out
their
plans
sometimes
proceed
one
way
and
sometimes
another
they
either
choose
with
great
skill
and
care
the
people
suitable
for
their
plans
and
then
leave
them
a
comparatively
large
amount
of
liberty
because
they
know
that
the
nature
of
the
persons
selected
impels
them
precisely
to
the
point
where
they
themselves
would
have
them
go
or
else
they
choose
badly
in
fact
take
whatever
comes
to
hand
but
out
of
every
piece
of
clay
they
form
something
useful
for
their
purpose
these
latter
minds
are
the
more
they
also
desire
more
submissive
instruments
their
knowledge
of
mankind
is
usually
much
smaller
their
contempt
of
mankind
greater
than
in
the
case
of
the
first
mentioned
class
but
the
machines
they
construct
generally
work
better
than
the
machines
from
the
workshops
of
the
former
arbitrary
law
jurists
dispute
whether
the
most
perfectly
law
or
that
which
is
most
easily
understood
should
prevail
in
a
nation
the
former
the
best
model
of
which
is
roman
law
seems
incomprehensible
to
the
layman
and
is
therefore
not
the
expression
of
his
sense
of
justice
popular
laws
the
germanic
for
instance
have
been
rude
superstitious
illogical
and
in
part
idiotic
but
they
represented
very
definite
inherited
national
morals
and
sentiments
but
where
as
with
us
law
i
no
longer
custom
it
can
only
and
be
compulsion
none
of
us
any
longer
possesses
a
traditional
sense
of
justice
we
must
therefore
content
ourselves
with
laws
which
are
the
expressions
of
the
necessity
that
there
law
the
most
logical
is
then
in
any
case
the
most
acceptable
because
it
is
the
most
granting
even
that
in
every
case
the
smallest
unit
of
measure
in
the
relation
of
crime
and
punishment
is
arbitrarily
fixed
the
great
man
of
the
the
recipe
for
what
the
masses
call
a
great
man
is
easily
given
in
all
circumstances
let
a
person
provide
them
with
something
very
pleasant
or
first
let
him
put
it
into
their
heads
that
this
or
that
would
be
very
pleasant
and
then
let
him
give
it
to
them
on
no
account
give
it
however
but
let
him
acquire
it
by
the
greatest
exertions
or
seem
thus
to
acquire
it
the
masses
must
have
the
impression
that
there
is
a
powerful
nay
indomitable
strength
of
will
operating
at
least
it
must
seem
to
be
there
operating
everybody
admires
a
strong
will
because
nobody
possesses
it
and
everybody
says
to
himself
that
if
he
did
possess
it
there
would
no
longer
be
any
bounds
for
him
and
his
egoism
if
then
it
becomes
evident
that
such
a
strong
will
effects
something
very
agreeable
to
the
masses
instead
of
hearkening
to
the
wishes
of
covetousness
people
admire
once
more
and
wish
good
luck
to
themselves
moreover
if
he
has
all
the
qualities
of
the
masses
they
are
the
less
ashamed
before
him
and
he
is
all
the
more
popular
consequently
he
may
be
violent
envious
rapacious
intriguing
flattering
fawning
inflated
and
according
to
circumstances
anything
whatsoever
prince
and
people
frequently
commune
with
their
princes
in
the
same
way
as
with
their
god
as
indeed
the
prince
himself
was
frequently
the
deity
representative
or
at
least
his
high
priest
this
almost
uncanny
disposition
of
veneration
disquiet
and
shame
grew
and
has
grown
much
weaker
but
occasionally
it
flares
up
again
and
fastens
upon
powerful
persons
generally
the
cult
of
genius
is
an
echo
of
this
veneration
of
gods
and
princes
wherever
an
effort
is
made
to
exalt
particular
men
to
the
superhuman
there
is
also
a
tendency
to
regard
whole
grades
of
the
population
as
coarser
and
baser
than
they
really
are
my
in
a
better
arranged
society
the
heavy
work
and
trouble
of
life
will
be
assigned
to
those
who
suffer
least
through
it
to
the
most
obtuse
therefore
and
so
step
by
step
up
to
those
who
are
most
sensitive
to
the
highest
and
sublimest
kinds
of
suffering
and
who
therefore
still
suffer
notwithstanding
the
greatest
alleviations
of
life
a
delusion
in
subversive
there
are
political
and
social
dreamers
who
ardently
and
eloquently
call
for
the
overthrow
of
all
order
in
the
belief
that
the
proudest
fane
of
beautiful
humanity
will
then
rear
itself
immediately
almost
of
its
own
accord
in
these
dangerous
dreams
there
is
still
an
echo
of
rousseau
superstition
which
believes
in
a
marvellous
primordial
goodness
of
human
nature
buried
up
as
it
were
and
lays
all
the
blame
of
that
on
the
institutions
of
civilisation
on
society
state
and
education
unfortunately
it
is
well
known
by
historical
experiences
that
every
such
overthrow
reawakens
into
new
life
the
wildest
energies
the
horrors
and
extravagances
of
remotest
ages
that
an
overthrow
therefore
may
possibly
be
a
source
of
strength
to
a
deteriorated
humanity
but
never
a
regulator
architect
artist
or
perfecter
of
human
nature
it
was
not
moderate
nature
inclined
towards
regulating
purifying
and
reconstructing
but
passionate
follies
and
that
aroused
the
optimistic
spirit
of
the
revolution

of
enlightenment
and
progressive
has
been
long
scared
away
let
us
see
each
of
us
individually
if
it
is
not
possible
to
recall
it
when
perfect
resoluteness
in
thinking
and
investigating
that
is
to
say
freedom
of
spirit
has
become
a
feature
of
character
it
produces
moderation
of
conduct
for
it
weakens
avidity
attracts
much
extant
energy
for
the
furtherance
of
intellectual
aims
and
shows
the
or
uselessness
and
danger
of
all
sudden
changes
the
resurrection
of
the
a
nation
usually
renews
its
youth
on
a
political
and
there
finds
again
the
spirit
which
it
had
gradually
lost
in
seeking
and
maintaining
power
culture
is
indebted
most
of
all
to
politically
weakened
periods
new
opinions
in
the
old
the
overthrow
of
opinions
is
not
immediately
followed
by
the
overthrow
of
institutions
on
the
contrary
the
new
opinions
dwell
for
a
long
time
in
the
desolate
and
haunted
house
of
their
predecessors
and
conserve
it
even
for
want
of
a
habitation
public
in
large
states
public
education
will
always
be
extremely
mediocre
for
the
same
reason
that
in
large
kitchens
the
cooking
is
at
best
only
mediocre
innocent
in
all
institutions
into
which
the
sharp
breeze
of
public
criticism
does
not
penetrate
an
innocent
corruption
grows
up
like
a
fungus
for
instance
in
learned
bodies
and
senates
scholars
as
to
scholars
who
become
politicians
the
comic
role
is
usually
assigned
they
have
to
be
the
good
conscience
of
a
state
policy
the
wolf
hidden
behind
the
almost
every
politician
in
certain
circumstances
has
such
need
of
an
honest
man
that
he
breaks
into
the
like
a
famished
wolf
not
however
to
devour
a
stolen
sheep
but
to
hide
himself
behind
its
woolly
back
happy
a
happy
age
is
no
longer
possible
because
men
only
wish
for
it
but
do
not
desire
to
have
it
and
each
individual
when
good
days
come
for
him
learns
positively
to
pray
for
disquiet
and
misery
the
destiny
of
mankind
is
arranged
for
every
life
has
such
but
not
for
happy
times
nevertheless
such
times
will
continue
to
exist
in
man
imagination
as
over
the
hills
and
far
away
an
heirloom
of
his
earliest
ancestors
for
the
idea
of
the
happy
age
from
the
earliest
times
to
the
present
has
no
doubt
been
derived
from
the
state
in
which
man
after
violent
exertions
in
hunting
and
warfare
gives
himself
over
to
repose
stretches
out
his
limbs
and
hears
the
wings
of
sleep
rustle
around
him
it
is
a
false
conclusion
when
in
accordance
with
that
old
habit
man
imagines
that
after
of
distress
and
trouble
he
will
be
able
also
to
enjoy
the
state
of
happiness
in
increase
and
religion
and
so
long
as
the
state
or
more
properly
the
government
regards
itself
as
the
appointed
guardian
of
a
number
of
minors
and
on
their
account
considers
the
question
whether
religion
should
be
preserved
or
abolished
it
is
highly
probable
that
it
will
always
decide
for
the
preservation
thereof
for
religion
satisfies
the
nature
of
the
individual
in
times
of
loss
destitution
terror
and
distrust
in
cases
therefore
where
the
government
feels
itself
incapable
of
doing
anything
directly
for
the
mitigation
of
the
spiritual
sufferings
of
the
individual
indeed
even
in
general
unavoidable
and
next
to
inevitable
evils
famines
financial
crises
and
wars
religion
gives
to
the
masses
an
attitude
of
tranquillity
and
confiding
expectancy
whenever
the
necessary
or
accidental
deficiencies
of
the
state
government
or
the
dangerous
consequences
of
dynastic
interests
strike
the
eyes
of
the
intelligent
and
make
them
refractory
the
unintelligent
will
only
think
they
see
the
finger
of
god
therein
and
will
submit
with
patience
to
the
dispensations
from
a
conception
in
which
divine
and
human
modes
of
government
usually
coalesce
thus
internal
civil
peace
and
continuity
of
development
will
be
preserved
the
power
which
lies
in
the
unity
of
popular
feeling
in
the
existence
of
the
same
opinions
and
aims
for
all
is
protected
and
confirmed
by
religion
the
rare
cases
excepted
in
which
a
priesthood
can
not
agree
with
the
state
about
the
price
and
therefore
comes
into
conflict
with
it
as
a
rule
the
state
will
know
how
to
win
over
the
priests
because
it
needs
their
most
private
and
secret
system
for
educating
souls
and
knows
how
to
value
servants
who
apparently
and
outwardly
represent
quite
other
interests
even
at
present
no
power
can
become
legitimate
without
the
assistance
of
the
priests
a
fact
which
napoleon
understood
thus
absolutely
paternal
government
and
the
careful
preservation
of
religion
necessarily
go
in
this
connection
it
must
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
rulers
and
governing
classes
are
enlightened
concerning
the
advantages
which
religion
affords
and
consequently
feel
themselves
to
a
certain
extent
superior
to
it
inasmuch
as
they
use
it
as
a
means
thus
freedom
of
spirit
has
its
origin
here
but
how
will
it
be
when
the
totally
different
interpretation
of
the
idea
of
government
such
as
is
taught
in
states
begins
to
prevail
when
one
sees
in
it
nothing
but
the
instrument
of
the
popular
will
no
upper
in
contrast
to
an
under
but
merely
a
function
of
the
sole
sovereign
the
people
here
also
only
the
same
attitude
which
the
people
assume
towards
religion
can
be
assumed
by
the
government
every
diffusion
of
enlightenment
will
have
to
find
an
echo
even
in
the
representatives
and
the
utilising
and
exploiting
of
religious
impulses
and
consolations
for
state
purposes
will
not
be
so
easy
unless
powerful
party
leaders
occasionally
exercise
an
influence
resembling
that
of
enlightened
despotism
when
however
the
state
is
not
permitted
to
derive
any
further
advantage
from
religion
or
when
people
think
far
too
variously
on
religious
matters
to
allow
the
state
to
adopt
a
consistent
and
uniform
procedure
with
respect
to
them
the
way
out
of
the
difficulty
will
necessarily
present
itself
namely
to
treat
religion
as
a
private
affair
and
leave
it
to
the
conscience
and
custom
of
each
single
individual
the
first
result
of
all
is
that
religious
feeling
seems
to
be
strengthened
inasmuch
as
hidden
and
suppressed
impulses
thereof
which
the
state
had
unintentionally
or
intentionally
stifled
now
break
forth
and
rush
to
extremes
later
on
however
it
is
found
that
religion
is
with
sects
and
that
an
abundance
of
dragon
teeth
were
sown
as
soon
as
religion
was
made
a
private
affair
the
spectacle
of
strife
and
the
hostile
laying
bare
of
all
the
weaknesses
of
religious
confessions
admit
finally
of
no
other
expedient
except
that
every
better
and
more
talented
person
should
make
irreligiousness
his
private
affair
a
sentiment
which
now
obtains
the
upper
hand
even
in
the
minds
of
the
governing
classes
and
almost
against
their
will
gives
an
character
to
their
measures
as
soon
as
this
happens
the
sentiment
of
persons
still
religiously
disposed
who
formerly
adored
the
state
as
something
half
sacred
or
wholly
sacred
changes
into
decided
to
the
state
they
lie
in
wait
for
governmental
measures
seeking
to
hinder
thwart
and
disturb
as
much
as
they
can
and
by
the
fury
of
their
contradiction
drive
the
opposing
parties
the
irreligious
ones
into
an
almost
fanatical
enthusiasm
the
state
in
connection
with
which
there
is
also
the
silently
influence
that
since
their
separation
from
religion
the
hearts
of
persons
in
these
circles
are
conscious
of
a
void
and
seek
by
devotion
to
the
state
to
provide
themselves
provisionally
with
a
substitute
for
religion
a
kind
of
stuffing
for
the
void
after
these
perhaps
lengthy
transitional
struggles
it
is
finally
decided
whether
the
religious
parties
are
still
strong
enough
to
revive
an
old
condition
of
things
and
turn
the
wheel
backwards
in
which
case
enlightened
despotism
perhaps
less
enlightened
and
more
timorous
than
formerly
inevitably
gets
the
state
into
its
hands
or
whether
the
parties
achieve
their
purpose
and
possibly
through
schools
and
education
check
the
increase
of
their
opponents
during
several
generations
and
finally
make
them
no
longer
possible
then
however
their
enthusiasm
for
the
state
also
abates
it
always
becomes
more
obvious
that
along
with
the
religious
adoration
which
regards
the
state
as
a
mystery
and
a
supernatural
institution
the
reverent
and
pious
relation
to
it
has
also
been
convulsed
henceforth
individuals
see
only
that
side
of
the
state
which
may
be
useful
or
injurious
to
them
and
press
forward
by
all
means
to
obtain
an
influence
over
it
but
this
rivalry
soon
becomes
too
great
men
and
parties
change
too
rapidly
and
throw
each
other
down
again
too
furiously
from
the
mountain
when
they
have
only
just
succeeded
in
getting
aloft
all
the
measures
which
such
a
government
carries
out
lack
the
guarantee
of
permanence
people
then
fight
shy
of
undertakings
which
would
require
the
silent
growth
of
future
decades
or
centuries
to
produce
ripe
fruit
nobody
henceforth
feels
any
other
obligation
to
a
law
than
to
submit
for
the
moment
to
the
power
which
introduced
the
law
people
immediately
set
to
work
however
to
undermine
it
by
a
new
power
a
majority
finally
it
may
be
confidently
asserted
the
distrust
of
all
government
the
insight
into
the
useless
and
harassing
nature
of
these
struggles
must
drive
men
to
an
entirely
new
resolution
to
the
abrogation
of
the
conception
of
the
state
and
the
abolition
of
the
contrast
of
private
and
public
private
concerns
gradually
absorb
the
business
of
the
state
even
the
toughest
residue
which
is
left
over
from
the
old
work
of
governing
the
business
for
instance
which
is
meant
to
protect
private
persons
from
private
persons
will
at
last
some
day
be
managed
by
private
enterprise
the
neglect
decline
and
of
the
state
the
liberation
of
the
private
person
i
am
careful
not
to
say
the
individual
are
the
consequences
of
the
democratic
conception
of
the
state
that
is
its
mission
when
it
has
accomplished
its
task
which
like
everything
human
involves
much
rationality
and
irrationality
and
when
all
relapses
into
the
old
malady
have
been
overcome
then
a
new
leaf
in
the
of
humanity
will
be
unrolled
on
which
readers
will
find
all
kinds
of
strange
tales
and
perhaps
also
some
amount
of
good
to
repeat
shortly
what
has
been
said
the
interests
of
the
tutelary
government
and
the
interests
of
religion
go
so
that
when
the
latter
begins
to
decay
the
foundations
of
the
state
are
also
shaken
the
belief
in
a
divine
regulation
of
political
affairs
in
a
mystery
in
the
existence
of
the
state
is
of
religious
origin
if
religion
disappears
the
state
will
inevitably
lose
its
old
veil
of
isis
and
will
no
longer
arouse
veneration
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
looked
at
closely
serves
also
to
dispel
the
final
fascination
and
superstition
in
the
realm
of
these
sentiments
modern
democracy
is
the
historical
form
of
the
of
the
the
outlook
which
results
from
this
certain
decay
is
not
however
unfortunate
in
every
respect
the
wisdom
and
the
selfishness
of
men
are
the
best
developed
of
all
their
qualities
when
the
state
no
longer
meets
the
demands
of
these
impulses
chaos
will
least
of
all
result
but
a
still
more
appropriate
expedient
than
the
state
will
get
the
mastery
over
the
state
how
man
organising
forces
have
already
been
seen
to
die
out
for
example
that
of
the
or
clan
which
for
millennia
was
far
mightier
than
the
power
of
the
family
and
indeed
already
ruled
and
regulated
long
before
the
latter
existed
we
ourselves
see
the
important
notions
of
the
right
and
might
of
the
family
which
once
possessed
the
supremacy
as
far
as
the
roman
system
extended
always
becoming
paler
and
feebler
in
the
same
way
a
later
generation
will
also
see
the
state
become
meaningless
in
certain
parts
of
the
world
an
idea
which
many
contemporaries
can
hardly
contemplate
without
alarm
and
horror
to
for
the
propagation
and
realisation
of
this
idea
is
certainly
another
thing
one
must
think
very
presumptuously
of
one
reason
and
only
half
understand
history
to
set
one
hand
to
the
plough
at
present
when
as
yet
no
one
can
show
us
the
seeds
that
are
afterwards
to
be
sown
upon
the
broken
soil
let
us
therefore
trust
to
the
wisdom
and
selfishness
of
men
that
the
state
may
exist
a
good
while
longer
and
that
the
destructive
attempts
of
too
hasty
sciolists
may
be
in
vain
socialism
with
regard
to
its
socialism
is
the
fantastic
younger
brother
of
almost
decrepit
despotism
which
it
wants
to
succeed
its
efforts
are
therefore
in
the
deepest
sense
reactionary
for
it
desires
such
an
amount
of
state
power
as
only
despotism
has
possessed
indeed
it
outdoes
all
the
past
in
that
it
aims
at
the
complete
annihilation
of
the
individual
whom
it
deems
an
unauthorised
luxury
of
nature
which
is
to
be
improved
by
it
into
an
appropriate
of
the
general
owing
to
its
relationship
it
always
appears
in
proximity
to
excessive
developments
of
power
like
the
old
typical
socialist
plato
at
the
court
of
the
sicilian
tyrant
it
desires
and
under
certain
circumstances
furthers
the
cæsarian
despotism
of
this
century
because
as
has
been
said
it
would
like
to
become
its
heir
but
even
this
inheritance
would
not
suffice
for
its
objects
it
requires
the
most
submissive
prostration
of
all
citizens
before
the
absolute
state
such
as
has
never
yet
been
realised
and
as
it
can
no
longer
even
count
upon
the
old
religious
piety
towards
the
state
but
must
rather
strive
involuntarily
and
continuously
for
the
abolition
thereof
because
it
strives
for
the
abolition
of
all
existing
it
can
only
hope
for
existence
occasionally
here
and
there
for
short
periods
by
means
of
the
extremest
terrorism
it
is
therefore
silently
preparing
itself
for
reigns
of
terror
and
drives
the
word
justice
like
a
nail
into
the
heads
of
the
masses
in
order
to
deprive
them
completely
of
their
understanding
after
they
had
already
suffered
seriously
from
the
and
to
provide
them
with
a
good
conscience
for
the
bad
game
they
are
to
play
socialism
may
serve
to
teach
very
brutally
and
impressively
the
danger
of
all
accumulations
of
state
power
and
may
serve
so
far
to
inspire
distrust
of
the
state
itself
when
its
rough
voice
strikes
up
the
much
state
as
the
shout
at
first
becomes
louder
than
ever
but
soon
the
opposition
cry
also
breaks
forth
with
so
much
greater
force
little
state
as
the
development
of
the
mind
feared
by
the
the
greek
was
like
every
organising
political
power
exclusive
and
distrustful
of
the
growth
of
culture
its
powerful
fundamental
impulse
seemed
almost
solely
to
have
a
paralysing
and
obstructive
effect
thereon
it
did
not
want
to
let
any
history
or
any
becoming
have
a
place
in
culture
the
education
laid
down
in
the
state
laws
was
meant
to
be
obligatory
on
all
generations
to
keep
them
at
stage
of
development
plato
also
later
on
did
not
desire
it
to
be
otherwise
in
his
ideal
state
spite
the
polis
culture
developed
itself
in
this
manner
indirectly
to
be
sure
and
against
its
will
the
polis
furnished
assistance
because
the
ambition
of
individuals
therein
was
stimulated
to
the
utmost
so
that
having
once
found
the
path
of
intellectual
development
they
followed
it
to
its
farthest
extremity
on
the
other
hand
appeal
should
not
be
made
to
the
panegyric
of
pericles
for
it
is
only
a
great
optimistic
dream
about
the
alleged
necessary
connection
between
the
polis
and
athenian
culture
immediately
before
the
night
fell
over
athens
the
plague
and
the
breakdown
of
tradition
thucydides
makes
this
culture
flash
up
once
more
like
of
the
evil
day
that
had
preceded
european
man
and
the
destruction
of
commerce
and
industry
interchange
of
books
and
letters
the
universality
of
all
higher
culture
the
rapid
changing
of
locality
and
landscape
and
the
present
nomadic
life
of
all
who
are
not
landowners
these
circumstances
necessarily
bring
with
them
a
weakening
and
finally
a
destruction
of
nationalities
at
least
of
european
nationalities
so
that
in
consequence
of
perpetual
crossings
there
must
arise
out
of
them
all
a
mixed
race
that
of
the
european
man
at
present
the
isolation
of
nations
through
the
rise
of
enmities
consciously
or
unconsciously
counteracts
this
tendency
but
nevertheless
the
process
of
fusing
advances
slowly
in
spite
of
those
occasional
this
artificial
nationalism
is
however
as
dangerous
as
was
artificial
catholicism
for
it
is
essentially
an
un
natural

which
has
been
proclaimed
by
the
few
over
the

artifice
lying
and
force
maintain
its
reputation
it
is
not
the

the
many
of
the
peoples
as
they
probably
say
but
it
is
first
of
all
the
interests
of
certain
princely
dynasties
and
then
of
certain
commercial
and
social
classes
which
impel
to
this
nationalism
once
we
have
recognised
this
fact
we
should
just
fearlessly
style
ourselves
and
labour
actively
for
the
amalgamation
of
nations
in
which
efforts
germans
may
assist
by
virtue
of
their
hereditary
position
as
and
intermediaries

their

intelligence
their
intellectual
and
volitional
capital
accumulated
from

to
generation
in
tedious
schools
of
suffering
must
necessarily
attain
to
universal
supremacy
here
to
an
extent
provocative
of
envy
and
hatred
so
that
the
literary
misconduct
is
becoming
prevalent
in
almost
all
modern
nations
and
all
the
more
so
as
they
again
set
up
to
be
national
of
sacrificing
the
jews
as
the
of
all
possible
public
and
private
abuses
so
soon
as
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
the
preservation
or
establishment
of
nations
but
of
the
production
and
training
of
a
european
of
the
greatest
possible
strength
the
jew
is
just
as
useful
and
desirable
an
ingredient
as
any
other
national
remnant
every
nation
every
individual
has
unpleasant
and
even
dangerous
qualities
it
is
cruel
to
require
that
the
jew
should
be
an
exception
those
qualities
may
even
be
dangerous
and
frightful
in
a
special
degree
in
his
case
and
perhaps
the
young
jew
is
in
general
the
most
repulsive
invention
of
the
human
species
nevertheless
in
a
general
summing
up
i
should
like
to
know
how
much
must
be
excused
in
a
nation
which
not
without
blame
on
the
part
of
all
of
us
has
had
the
most
mournful
history
of
all
nations
and
to
which
we
owe
the
most
loving
of
men
christ
the
most
upright
of
sages
spinoza
the
mightiest
book
and
the
most
effective
moral
law
in
the
world
moreover
in
the
darkest
times
of
the
middle
ages
when
asiatic
clouds
had
gathered
darkly
over
europe
it
was
jewish
scholars
and
physicians
who
upheld
the
banner
of
enlightenment
and
of
intellectual
independence
under
the
severest
personal
sufferings
and
defended
europe
against
asia
we
owe
it
not
least
to
their
efforts
that
a
more
natural
more
reasonable
at
all
events
explanation
of
the
world
was
finally
able
to
get
the
upper
hand
once
more
and
that
the
link
of
culture
which
now
unites
us
with
the
enlightenment
of
antiquity
has
remained
unbroken
if
christianity
has
done
everything
to
orientalise
the
occident
judaism
has
assisted
essentially
in
occidentalising
it
anew
which
in
a
certain
sense
is
equivalent
to
making
europe
mission
and
history
a
of
that
of
apparent
superiority
of
the
middle
the
middle
ages
present
in
the
church
an
institution
with
an
absolutely
universal
aim
involving
the
whole
of
humanity
an
aim
moreover
which
presumedly
concerned
man
highest
interests
in
comparison
therewith
the
aims
of
the
states
and
nations
which
modern
history
exhibits
make
a
painful
impression
they
seem
petty
base
material
and
restricted
in
extent
but
this
different
impression
on
our
imagination
should
certainly
not
determine
our
judgment
for
that
universal
institution
corresponded
to
feigned
and
fictitiously
fostered
needs
such
as
the
need
of
salvation
which
wherever
they
did
not
already
exist
it
had
first
of
all
to
create
the
new
institutions
however
relieve
actual
distresses
and
the
time
is
coming
when
institutions
will
arise
to
minister
to
the
common
genuine
needs
of
all
men
and
to
cast
that
fantastic
prototype
the
catholic
church
into
shade
and
oblivion
war
it
is
nothing
but
fanaticism
and
beautiful
soulism
to
expect
very
much
or
even
much
only
from
humanity
when
it
has
forgotten
how
to
wage
war
for
the
present
we
know
of
no
other
means
whereby
the
rough
energy
of
the
camp
the
deep
impersonal
hatred
the
of
murder
with
a
good
conscience
the
general
ardour
of
the
system
in
the
destruction
of
the
enemy
the
proud
indifference
to
great
losses
to
one
own
existence
and
that
of
one
friends
the
hollow
convulsion
of
the
soul
can
be
as
forcibly
and
certainly
communicated
to
enervated
nations
as
is
done
by
every
great
war
owing
to
the
brooks
and
streams
that
here
break
forth
which
certainly
sweep
stones
and
rubbish
of
all
sorts
along
with
them
and
destroy
the
meadows
of
delicate
cultures
the
mechanism
in
the
workshops
of
the
mind
is
afterwards
in
favourable
circumstances
rotated
by
new
power
culture
can
by
no
means
dispense
with
passions
vices
and
malignities
when
the
romans
after
having
become
imperial
had
grown
rather
tired
of
war
they
attempted
to
gain
new
strength
by
gladiatoral
combats
and
christian
persecutions
the
english
of
who
appear
on
the
whole
to
have
also
renounced
war
adopt
other
means
in
order
to
generate
anew
those
vanishing
forces
namely
the
dangerous
exploring
expeditions
sea
voyages
and
mountaineerings
nominally
undertaken
for
scientific
purposes
but
in
reality
to
bring
home
surplus
strength
from
adventures
and
dangers
of
all
kinds
many
other
such
substitutes
for
war
will
be
discovered
but
perhaps
precisely
thereby
it
will
become
more
and
more
obvious
that
such
a
highly
cultivated
and
therefore
necessarily
enfeebled
humanity
as
that
of
modern
europe
not
only
needs
wars
but
the
greatest
and
most
terrible
wars
consequently
occasional
relapses
into
barbarism
lest
by
the
means
of
culture
it
should
lose
its
culture
and
its
very
existence
industry
in
the
south
and
the
industry
arises
in
two
entirely
different
ways
the
artisans
of
the
south
are
not
industrious
because
of
acquisitiveness
but
because
of
the
constant
needs
of
others
the
smith
is
industrious
because
some
one
is
always
coming
who
wants
a
horse
shod
or
a
carriage
mended
if
nobody
came
he
would
loiter
about
in
the
in
a
fruitful
land
he
has
little
trouble
in
supporting
himself
for
that
purpose
he
requires
only
a
very
small
amount
of
work
certainly
no
industry
eventually
he
would
beg
and
be
contented
the
industry
of
english
workmen
on
the
contrary
has
acquisitiveness
behind
it
it
is
conscious
of
itself
and
its
aims
with
property
it
wants
power
and
with
power
the
greatest
possible
liberty
and
individual
distinction
wealth
as
the
origin
of
a
nobility
of
wealth
necessarily
creates
an
aristocracy
of
race
for
it
permits
the
choice
of
the
most
beautiful
women
and
the
engagement
of
the
best
teachers
it
allows
a
man
cleanliness
time
for
physical
exercises
and
above
all
immunity
from
dulling
physical
labour
so
far
it
provides
all
the
conditions
for
making
man
after
a
few
generations
move
and
even
act
nobly
and
handsomely
greater
freedom
of
character
and
absence
of
niggardliness
of
wretchedly
petty
matters
and
of
abasement
before
it
is
precisely
these
negative
qualities
which
are
the
most
profitable
birthday
gift
that
of
happiness
for
the
young
man
a
person
who
is
quite
poor
usually
comes
to
grief
through
nobility
of
disposition
he
does
not
get
on
and
acquires
nothing
his
race
is
not
capable
of
living
in
this
connection
however
it
must
be
remembered
that
wealth
produces
almost
the
same
effects
whether
one
have
three
hundred
or
thirty
thousand
thalers
a
year
there
is
no
further
essential
progression
of
the
favourable
conditions
afterwards
but
to
have
less
to
beg
in
boyhood
and
to
abase
one
self
is
terrible
although
it
may
be
the
proper
for
such
as
seek
their
happiness
in
the
splendour
of
courts
in
subordination
to
the
mighty
and
influential
or
for
such
as
wish
to
be
heads
of
the
church
it
teaches
how
to
slink
crouching
into
the
underground
passages
to
favour
envy
and
inertia
in
different
the
two
opposing
parties
the
socialist
and
the
national
or
whatever
they
may
be
called
in
the
different
countries
of
europe
are
worthy
of
each
other
envy
and
laziness
are
the
motive
powers
in
each
of
them
in
the
one
camp
they
desire
to
work
as
little
as
possible
with
their
hands
in
the
other
as
little
as
possible
with
their
heads
in
the
latter
they
hate
and
envy
prominent
individuals
who
do
not
willingly
allow
themselves
to
be
drawn
up
in
rank
and
file
for
the
purpose
of
a
collective
effect
in
the
former
they
hate
and
envy
the
better
social
caste
which
is
more
favourably
circumstanced
outwardly
whose
peculiar
mission
the
production
of
the
highest
blessings
of
culture
makes
life
inwardly
all
the
harder
and
more
painful
certainly
if
it
be
possible
to
make
the
spirit
of
the
collective
effect
the
spirit
of
the
higher
classes
of
society
the
socialist
crowds
are
quite
right
when
they
also
seek
outward
equalisation
between
themselves
and
these
classes
since
they
are
certainly
internally
equalised
with
one
another
already
in
head
and
heart
live
as
higher
men
and
always
do
the
deeds
of
higher
culture
thus
everything
that
lives
will
acknowledge
your
right
and
the
order
of
society
whose
summit
ye
are
will
be
safe
from
every
evil
glance
and
attack
high
politics
and
their
just
as
a
nation
does
not
suffer
the
greatest
losses
that
war
and
readiness
for
war
involve
through
the
expenses
of
the
war
or
the
stoppage
of
trade
and
traffic
or
through
the
maintenance
of
a
standing
army
however
great
these
losses
may
now
be
when
eight
european
states
expend
yearly
the
sum
of
five
milliards
of
marks
thereon
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
year
after
year
its
ablest
strongest
and
most
industrious
men
are
withdrawn
in
extraordinary
numbers
from
their
proper
occupations
and
callings
to
be
turned
into
soldiers
in
the
same
way
a
nation
that
sets
about
practising
high
politics
and
securing
a
decisive
voice
among
the
great
powers
does
not
suffer
its
greatest
losses
where
they
are
usually
supposed
to
be
in
fact
from
this
time
onward
it
constantly
sacrifices
a
number
of
its
most
conspicuous
talents
upon
the
altar
of
the
fatherland
or
of
national
ambition
whilst
formerly
other
spheres
of
activity
were
open
to
those
talents
which
are
now
swallowed
up
by
politics
but
apart
from
these
public
hecatombs
and
in
reality
much
more
horrible
there
is
a
drama
which
is
constantly
being
performed
simultaneously
in
a
hundred
thousand
acts
every
able
industrious
intellectually
striving
man
of
a
nation
that
thus
covets
political
laurels
is
swayed
by
this
covetousness
and
no
longer
belongs
entirely
to
himself
alone
as
he
did
formerly
the
new
daily
questions
and
cares
of
the
public
welfare
devour
a
daily
tribute
of
the
intellectual
and
emotional
capital
of
every
citizen
the
sum
of
all
these
sacrifices
and
losses
of
individual
energy
and
labour
is
so
enormous
that
the
political
growth
of
a
nation
almost
necessarily
entails
an
intellectual
impoverishment
and
lassitude
a
diminished
capacity
for
the
performance
of
works
that
require
great
concentration
and
specialisation
the
question
may
finally
be
asked
does
it
then
all
this
bloom
and
magnificence
of
the
total
which
indeed
only
manifests
itself
as
the
fear
of
the
new
colossus
in
other
nations
and
as
the
compulsory
favouring
by
them
of
national
trade
and
commerce
when
all
the
nobler
finer
and
more
intellectual
plants
and
products
in
which
its
soil
was
hitherto
so
rich
must
be
sacrificed
to
this
coarse
and
opalescent
flower
of
the
nation
repeated
once
public
opinion
private
laziness
footnote
this
aphorism
may
have
been
suggested
by
observing
the
behaviour
of
his
great
contemporary
bismarck
towards
the

this
is
once
more
an
allusion
to
modern
ninth

himself
the

more
dangerous
enemies
of

than

a
we
criticise
a
thinker
more
severely
when
he
puts
an
unpleasant
statement
before
us
and
yet
it
would
be
more
reasonable
to
do
so
when
we
find
his
statement

that

the

have
got
charred

as

are
perhaps
more

they
are
useless

uncomfortable
humanity
ruthlessly
uses
every
individual
as
material
for
the
heating
of
its
great
machines
but
what
then
is
the
purpose
of
the
machines
when
all
individuals
that
is
the
human
race
are
useful
only
to
maintain
them
machines
that
are
ends
in
themselves
is
that
the
the
of
life
consists
of
rare
single
moments
of
the
greatest
importance
and
of
countless
intervals
during
which
at
best
the
phantoms
of
those
moments
hover
around
us
love
the
spring
every
fine
melody
the
mountains
the
moon
the
sea
all
speak
but
once
fully
to
the
heart
if
indeed
they
ever
do
quite
attain
to

for
many
people
have
not
those
moments
at
all
and
are
themselves
intervals
and
pauses
in
the
symphony
of
actual
life
attack
or
we
often
make
the
mistake
of
showing
violent
enmity
towards
a
tendency
party
or
period
because
we
happen
only
to
get
a
sight
of
its
most
exposed
side
its
stuntedness
or
the
inevitable
faults
of
its
virtues
perhaps
because
we
ourselves
have
taken
a
prominent
part
in
them
we
then
turn
our
backs
on
them
and
seek
a
diametrically
opposite
course
but
the
better
way
would
be
to
seek
out
their
strong
good
sides
or
to
develop
them
in
ourselves
to
be
sure
a
keener
glance
and
a
better
will
are
needed
to
improve
the
becoming
and
the
imperfect
than
are
required
to
see
through
it
in
its
imperfection
and
to
deny
it
there
is
true
modesty
that
is
the
knowledge
that
we
are
not
the
works
we
create
and
it
is
especially
becoming
in
a
great
mind
because
such
a
mind
can
well
grasp
the
thought
of
absolute
irresponsibility
even
for
the
good
it
creates
people
do
not
hate
a
great
man
presumptuousness
in
so
far
as
he
feels
his
strength
but
because
he
wishes
to
prove
it
by
injuring
others
by
dominating
them
and
seeing
how
long
they
will
stand
it
this
as
a
rule
is
even
a
proof
of
the
absence
of
a
secure
sense
of
power
and
makes
people
doubt
his
greatness
we
must
therefore
beware
of
presumption
from
the
of
wisdom
the
day
first
the
best
way
to
begin
a
day
well
is
to
think
on
awakening
whether
we
can
not
give
pleasure
during
the
day
to
at
least
one
person
if
this
could
become
a
substitute
for
the
religious
habit
of
prayer
our
would
benefit
by
the
change
presumption
as
the
last
when
we
so
interpret
a
misfortune
an
intellectual
defect
or
a
disease
that
we
see
therein
our
predestined
fate
our
trial
or
the
mysterious
punishment
of
our
former
misdeeds
we
thereby
make
our
nature
interesting
and
exalt
ourselves
in
imagination
above
our
fellows
the
proud
sinner
is
a
figure
in
all
religious
sects
the
vegetation
of
close
beside
the
world
woe
and
often
upon
its
volcanic
soil
man
has
laid
out
his
little
garden
of
happiness
whether
one
regard
life
with
the
eyes
of
him
who
only
seeks
knowledge
therefrom
or
of
him
who
submits
and
is
resigned
or
of
him
who
rejoices
over
surmounted
difficulties
everywhere
one
will
find
some
happiness
springing
up
beside
the
evil
and
in
fact
always
the
more
happiness
the
more
volcanic
the
soil
has
been
only
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
suffering
itself
is
justified
by
this
happiness
the
path
of
our
it
is
sensible
when
a
person
develops
still
further
in
himself
the
upon
which
his
father
or
grandfather
spent
much
trouble
and
does
not
shift
to
something
entirely
new
otherwise
he
deprives
himself
of
the
possibility
of
attaining
perfection
in
any
one
craft
that
is
why
the
proverb
says
which
road
shouldst
thou
ride
that
of
thine
ancestors
vanity
and
ambition
as
as
long
as
a
person
has
not
become
an
instrument
of
general
utility
ambition
may
torment
him
if
however
that
point
has
been
reached
if
he
necessarily
works
like
a
machine
for
the
good
of
all
then
vanity
may
result
it
will
humanise
him
in
small
matters
and
make
him
more
sociable
endurable
and
considerate
when
ambition
has
completed
the
coarser
work
of
making
him
useful
philosophical
immediately
we
have
comprehended
the
wisdom
of
a
philosopher
we
go
through
the
streets
with
a
feeling
as
if
we
had
been
and
had
become
great
men
for
we
encounter
only
those
who
are
ignorant
of
this
wisdom
and
have
therefore
to
deliver
new
and
unknown
verdicts
concerning
everything
because
we
now
recognise
a
we
think
we
must
also
comport
ourselves
as
judges
pleasing
by
people
who
prefer
to
attract
attention
and
thereby
to
displease
desire
the
same
thing
as
those
who
neither
wish
to
please
nor
to
attract
attention
only
they
seek
it
more
ardently
and
indirectly
by
means
of
a
step
by
which
they
apparently
move
away
from
their
goal
they
desire
influence
and
power
and
therefore
show
their
superiority
even
to
such
an
extent
that
it
becomes
disagreeable
for
they
know
that
he
who
has
finally
attained
power
pleases
in
almost
all
he
says
and
does
and
that
even
when
he
displeases
he
still
seems
to
please
the
free
spirit
also
and
in
like
manner
the
believer
desire
power
in
order
some
day
to
please
thereby
when
on
account
of
their
doctrine
evil
fate
persecution
dungeon
or
execution
threaten
them
they
rejoice
in
the
thought
that
their
teaching
will
thus
be
engraved
and
branded
on
the
heart
of
mankind
though
its
effect
is
remote
they
accept
their
fate
as
a
painful
but
powerful
means
of
still
attaining
to
power
and
the
the
prince
who
for
his
determination
to
make
war
against
his
neighbour
invents
a
belli
is
like
a
father
who
foists
on
his
child
a
mother
who
is
henceforth
to
be
regarded
as
such
and
are
not
almost
all
publicly
avowed
motives
of
action
just
such
spurious
mothers
passion
and
nobody
talks
more
passionately
of
his
rights
than
he
who
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
is
doubtful
about
them
by
getting
passion
on
his
side
he
seeks
to
confound
his
understanding
and
its
doubts
he
thus
obtains
a
good
conscience
and
along
with
it
success
with
his
the
trick
of
the
resigning
he
who
protests
against
marriage
after
the
manner
of
catholic
priests
will
conceive
of
it
in
its
lowest
and
vulgarest
form
in
the
same
way
he
who
disavows
the
honour
of
his
contemporaries
will
have
a
mean
opinion
of
it
he
can
thus
dispense
with
it
and
struggle
against
it
more
easily
moreover
he
who
denies
himself
much
in
great
matters
will
readily
indulge
himself
in
small
things
it
might
be
possible
that
he
who
is
superior
to
the
approbation
of
his
contemporaries
would
nevertheless
not
deny
himself
the
gratification
of
small
vanities
the
years
of
the
proper
period
of
presumption
in
gifted
people
is
between
their
and
thirtieth
years
it
is
the
time
of
early
ripeness
with
a
large
residue
of
sourness
on
the
ground
of
what
we
feel
within
ourselves
we
demand
honour
and
humility
from
men
who
see
little
or
nothing
of
it
and
because
this
tribute
is
not
immediately
forthcoming
we
revenge
ourselves
by
the
look
the
gesture
of
arrogance
and
the
tone
of
voice
which
a
keen
ear
and
eye
recognise
in
every
product
of
those
years
whether
it
be
poetry
philosophy
or
pictures
and
music
older
men
of
experience
smile
thereat
and
think
with
emotion
of
those
beautiful
years
in
which
one
resents
the
fate
of
so
much
and
so
little
later
on
one
really
more
but
one
has
lost
the
good
belief
in
much
unless
one
remain
for
life
an
incorrigible
fool
of
vanity
deceptive
and
yet
just
as
in
order
to
pass
by
an
abyss
or
to
cross
a
deep
stream
on
a
plank
we
require
a
railing
not
to
hold
fast
by
for
it
would
instantly
break
down
with
us
but
to
give
the
notion
of
security
to
the
eye
so
in
youth
we
require
persons
who
unconsciously
render
us
the
service
of
that
railing
it
is
true
they
would
not
help
us
if
we
really
wished
to
lean
upon
them
in
great
danger
but
they
afford
the
tranquillising
sensation
of
protection
close
to
one
for
instance
fathers
teachers
friends
as
all
three
usually
are
learning
to
one
must
learn
to
love
one
must
learn
to
be
kind
and
this
from
childhood
onwards
when
education
and
chance
give
us
no
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
these
feelings
our
soul
becomes
dried
up
and
even
incapable
of
understanding
the
fine
devices
of
loving
men
in
the
same
way
hatred
must
be
learnt
and
fostered
when
one
wants
to
become
a
proficient
hater
otherwise
the
germ
of
it
will
gradually
die
out
ruin
as
persons
who
pass
through
numerous
mental
phases
retain
certain
sentiments
and
habits
of
their
earlier
states
which
then
project
like
a
piece
of
inexplicable
antiquity
and
grey
stonework
into
their
new
thought
and
action
often
to
the
embellishment
of
the
whole
surroundings
love
and
love
desires
fear
avoids
that
is
why
one
can
not
be
both
loved
and
honoured
by
the
same
person
at
least
not
at
the
same
time
for
he
who
honours
recognises
power
that
is
to
say
he
fears
it
he
is
in
a
state
of
reverential
fear
but
love
recognises
no
power
nothing
that
divides
detaches
superordinates
or
subordinates
because
it
does
not
honour
them
ambitious
people
secretly
or
openly
resent
being
loved
a
prejudice
in
favour
of
cold
people
who
quickly
take
fire
grow
cold
quickly
and
therefore
are
on
the
whole
unreliable
for
those
therefore
who
are
always
cold
or
pretend
to
be
so
there
is
the
favourable
prejudice
that
they
are
particularly
trustworthy
reliable
persons
they
are
confounded
with
those
who
take
fire
slowly
and
retain
it
long
the
danger
in
free
frivolous
occupation
with
free
opinions
has
a
charm
like
a
kind
of
itching
if
one
yields
to
it
further
one
begins
to
chafe
the
places
until
at
last
an
open
painful
wound
results
that
is
to
say
until
the
free
opinion
begins
to
disturb
and
torment
us
in
our
position
in
life
and
in
our
human
relations
desire
for
sore
when
passion
is
over
it
leaves
behind
an
obscure
longing
for
it
and
even
in
disappearing
it
casts
a
seductive
glance
at
us
it
must
have
afforded
a
kind
of
pleasure
to
have
been
beaten
with
this
scourge
compared
with
it
the
more
moderate
sensations
appear
insipid
we
still
prefer
apparently
the
more
violent
displeasure
to
languid
delight
dissatisfaction
with
others
and
with
the
when
as
so
frequently
happens
we
vent
our
dissatisfaction
on
others
when
we
are
really
dissatisfied
with
ourselves
we
are
in
fact
attempting
to
mystify
and
deceive
our
judgment
we
desire
to
find
a
motive
for
this
dissatisfaction
in
the
mistakes
or
deficiencies
of
others
and
so
lose
sight
of
ourselves
strictly
religious
people
who
have
been
relentless
judges
of
themselves
have
at
the
same
time
spoken
most
ill
of
humanity
generally
there
has
never
been
a
saint
who
reserved
sin
for
himself
and
virture
for
others
any
more
than
a
man
who
according
to
buddha
rule
hides
his
good
qualities
from
people
and
only
shows
his
bad
ones
confusion
of
cause
and
unconsciously
we
seek
the
principles
and
opinions
which
are
suited
to
our
temperament
so
that
at
last
it
seems
as
if
these
principles
and
opinions
had
formed
our
character
and
given
it
support
and
stability
whereas
exactly
the
contrary
has
taken
place
our
thoughts
and
judgments
are
apparently
to
be
taken
subsequently
as
the
causes
of
our
nature
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
nature
is
the
cause
of
our
so
thinking
and
judging
and
what
induces
us
to
play
this
almost
unconscious
comedy
inertness
and
convenience
and
to
a
large
extent
also
the
vain
desire
to
be
regarded
as
thoroughly
consistent
and
homogeneous
in
nature
and
thought
for
this
wins
respect
and
gives
confidence
and
power
age
in
relation
to
young
people
love
what
is
interesting
and
exceptional
indifferent
whether
it
is
truth
or
falsehood
riper
minds
love
what
is
interesting
and
extraordinary
when
it
is
truth
matured
minds
finally
love
truth
even
in
those
in
whom
it
appears
plain
and
simple
and
is
found
tiresome
by
ordinary
people
because
they
have
observed
that
truth
is
in
the
habit
of
giving
utterance
to
its
highest
intellectual
verities
with
all
the
appearance
of
simplicity
men
as
bad
just
as
bad
poets
seek
a
thought
to
fit
the
rhyme
in
the
second
half
of
the
verse
so
men
in
the
second
half
of
life
having
become
more
scrupulous
are
in
the
habit
of
seeking
pursuits
positions
and
conditions
which
suit
those
of
their
earlier
life
so
that
outwardly
all
sounds
well
but
their
life
is
no
longer
ruled
and
continuously
determined
anew
by
a
powerful
thought
in
place
thereof
there
is
merely
the
intention
of
finding
a
rhyme
ennui
and
necessity
compels
us
to
work
with
the
product
of
which
the
necessity
is
appeased
the
ever
new
awakening
of
necessity
however
accustoms
us
to
work
but
in
the
intervals
in
which
necessity
is
appeased
and
asleep
as
it
were
we
are
attacked
by
ennui
what
is
this
in
a
word
it
is
the
habituation
to
work
which
now
makes
itself
felt
as
a
new
and
additional
necessity
it
will
be
all
the
stronger
the
more
a
person
has
been
accustomed
to
work
perhaps
even
the
more
a
person
has
suffered
from
necessities
in
order
to
escape
ennui
a
man
either
works
beyond
the
extent
of
his
former
necessities
or
he
invents
play
that
is
to
say
work
that
is
only
intended
to
appease
the
general
necessity
for
work
he
who
has
become
satiated
with
play
and
has
no
new
necessities
impelling
him
to
work
is
sometimes
attacked
by
the
longing
for
a
third
state
which
is
related
to
play
as
gliding
is
to
dancing
as
dancing
is
to
walking
a
blessed
tranquil
movement
it
is
the
artists
and
philosophers
vision
of
happiness
lessons
from
if
we
look
at
a
series
of
pictures
of
ourselves
from
the
time
of
later
childhood
to
the
time
of
mature
manhood
we
discover
with
pleased
surprise
that
the
man
bears
more
resemblance
to
the
child
than
to
the
youth
that
probably
therefore
in
accordance
with
this
fact
there
has
been
in
the
interval
a
temporary
alienation
of
the
fundamental
character
over
which
the
collected
concentrated
force
of
the
man
has
again
become
master
with
this
observation
this
other
is
also
in
accordance
namely
that
all
strong
influences
of
passions
teachers
and
political
events
which
in
our
youthful
years
draw
us
hither
and
thither
seem
later
on
to
be
referred
back
again
to
a
fixed
standard
of
course
they
still
continue
to
exist
and
operate
within
us
but
our
fundamental
sentiments
and
opinions
have
now
the
upper
hand
and
use
their
influence
perhaps
as
a
source
of
strength
but
are
no
longer
merely
regulative
as
was
perhaps
the
case
in
our
twenties
thus
even
the
thoughts
and
sentiments
of
the
man
appear
more
in
accordance
with
those
of
his
childish
years
and
this
objective
fact
expresses
itself
in
the
subjective
fact
the
tone
of
voice
of
different
the
tone
in
which
youths
speak
praise
blame
and
versify
displeases
an
older
person
because
it
is
too
loud
and
yet
at
the
same
time
dull
and
confused
like
a
sound
in
a
vault
which
acquires
such
a
loud
ring
owing
to
the
emptiness
for
most
of
the
thought
of
youths
does
not
gush
forth
out
of
the
fulness
of
their
own
nature
but
is
the
accord
and
the
echo
of
what
has
been
thought
said
praised
or
blamed
around
them
as
their
sentiments
however
their
inclinations
and
aversions
resound
much
more
forcibly
than
the
reasons
thereof
there
is
heard
whenever
they
divulge
these
sentiments
the
dull
clanging
tone
which
is
a
sign
of
the
absence
or
scarcity
of
reasons
the
tone
of
riper
age
is
rigorous
abruptly
concise
moderately
loud
but
like
everything
distinctly
articulated
is
heard
very
far
off
old
age
finally
often
brings
a
certain
mildness
and
consideration
into
the
tone
of
the
voice
and
as
it
were
sweetens
it
in
many
cases
to
be
sure
it
also
sours
it
the
atavist
and
the
the
man
of
unpleasant
character
full
of
distrust
envious
of
the
success
of
and
neighbours
violent
and
enraged
at
divergent
opinions
shows
that
he
belongs
to
an
earlier
grade
of
culture
and
is
therefore
an
atavism
for
the
way
in
which
he
behaves
to
people
was
right
and
suitable
only
for
an
age
of
he
is
an
the
man
of
a
different
character
rich
in
sympathy
winning
friends
everywhere
finding
all
that
is
growing
and
becoming
amiable
rejoicing
at
the
honours
and
successes
of
others
and
claiming
no
privilege
of
solely
knowing
the
truth
but
full
of
a
modest
distrust
he
is
a
forerunner
who
presses
upward
towards
a
higher
human
culture
the
man
of
unpleasant
character
dates
from
the
times
when
the
rude
basis
of
human
intercourse
had
yet
to
be
laid
the
other
lives
on
the
upper
floor
of
the
edifice
of
culture
removed
as
far
as
possible
from
the
howling
and
raging
wild
beast
imprisoned
in
the
cellars
consolation
for
when
a
great
thinker
is
temporarily
subjected
to
hypochondriacal
he
can
say
to
himself
by
way
of
consolation
it
is
thine
own
great
strength
on
which
this
parasite
feeds
and
grows
if
thy
strength
were
smaller
thou
wouldst
have
less
to
suffer
the
statesman
may
say
just
the
same
thing
when
jealousy
and
vengeful
feeling
or
in
a
word
the
tone
of
the
omnium
contra
omnes
for
which
as
the
representative
of
a
nation
he
must
necessarily
have
a
great
capacity
occasionally
intrudes
into
his
personal
relations
and
makes
his
life
hard
estranged
from
the
there
are
great
advantages
in
estranging
one
self
for
once
to
a
large
extent
from
one
age
and
being
as
it
were
driven
back
from
its
shores
into
the
ocean
of
past
views
of
things
looking
thence
towards
the
coast
one
commands
a
view
perhaps
for
the
first
time
of
its
aggregate
formation
and
when
one
again
approaches
the
land
one
has
the
advantage
of
understanding
it
better
on
the
whole
than
those
who
have
never
left
it
sowing
and
reaping
on
the
field
of
personal
men
like
rousseau
understand
how
to
use
their
weaknesses
defects
and
vices
as
manure
for
their
talent
when
rousseau
bewails
the
corruption
and
degeneration
of
society
as
the
evil
results
of
culture
there
is
a
personal
experience
at
the
bottom
of
it
the
bitterness
which
gives
sharpness
to
his
general
condemnation
and
poisons
the
arrows
with
which
he
shoots
he
unburdens
himself
first
as
an
individual
and
thinks
of
getting
a
remedy
which
while
benefiting
society
directly
will
also
benefit
himself
indirectly
by
means
of
society
philosophically
we
usually
endeavour
to
acquire
attitude
of
mind
set
of
opinions
for
all
situations
and
events
of
life
it
is
mostly
called
being
philosophically
minded
but
for
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
it
may
be
of
greater
importance
not
to
make
ourselves
thus
uniform
but
to
hearken
to
the
low
voice
of
the
different
situations
in
life
these
bring
their
own
opinions
with
them
we
thus
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
life
and
nature
of
many
persons
by
not
treating
ourselves
as
rigid
persistent
single
individuals
in
the
fire
of
it
is
a
fresh
step
towards
independence
when
one
first
dares
to
give
utterance
to
opinions
which
it
is
considered
as
disgraceful
for
a
person
to
entertain
even
friends
and
acquaintances
are
then
accustomed
to
grow
anxious
the
gifted
nature
must
also
pass
through
this
fire
it
afterwards
belongs
far
more
to
itself
in
the
event
of
choice
a
great
sacrifice
is
preferred
to
a
small
one
because
we
compensate
ourselves
for
the
great
sacrifice
by
which
is
not
possible
in
the
case
of
a
small
one
love
as
an
whoever
really
wishes
to
acquainted
something
new
whether
it
be
a
person
an
event
or
a
book
does
well
to
take
up
the
matter
with
all
possible
love
and
to
avert
his
eye
quickly
from
all
that
seems
hostile
objectionable
and
false
therein
in
fact
to
forget
such
things
so
that
for
instance
he
gives
the
author
of
a
book
the
best
start
possible
and
straightway
just
as
in
a
race
longs
with
beating
heart
that
he
may
reach
the
goal
in
this
manner
one
penetrates
to
the
heart
of
the
new
thing
to
its
moving
point
and
this
is
called
becoming
acquainted
with
it
this
stage
having
been
arrived
at
the
understanding
afterwards
makes
its
restrictions
the
and
the
temporary
suspension
of
the
critical
pendulum
were
only
artifices
to
lure
forth
the
soul
of
the
matter
thinking
too
well
and
too
ill
of
the
whether
we
think
too
well
or
too
ill
of
things
we
always
have
the
advantage
of
deriving
therefrom
a
greater
pleasure
for
with
a
too
good
preconception
we
usually
put
more
sweetness
into
things
experiences
than
they
actually
contain
a
too
bad
preconception
causes
a
pleasant
disappointment
the
pleasantness
that
lay
in
the
things
themselves
is
increased
by
the
pleasantness
of
the
surprise
a
gloomy
temperament
however
will
have
the
reverse
experience
in
both
cases
profound
those
whose
strength
lies
in
the
deepening
of
impressions
they
are
usually
called
profound
people
are
relatively
and
decided
in
all
sudden
emergencies
for
in
the
first
moment
the
impression
is
still
shallow
it
only
then
deep
long
foreseen
long
expected
events
or
persons
however
excite
such
natures
most
and
make
them
almost
incapable
of
eventually
having
presence
of
mind
on
the
arrival
thereof
intercourse
with
the
higher
every
one
has
his
good
day
when
he
finds
his
higher
self
and
true
humanity
demands
that
a
person
shall
be
estimated
according
to
this
state
and
not
according
to
his
of
constraint
and
bondage
a
painter
for
instance
should
be
appraised
and
honoured
according
to
the
most
exalted
vision
he
could
see
and
represent
but
men
themselves
commune
very
differently
with
this
their
higher
self
and
are
frequently
their
own
playactors
in
so
far
as
they
repeatedly
imitate
what
they
are
in
those
moments
some
stand
in
awe
and
humility
before
their
ideal
and
would
fain
deny
it
they
are
afraid
of
their
higher
self
because
when
it
speaks
it
speaks
pretentiously
besides
it
has
a
freedom
of
coming
and
staying
away
just
as
it
pleases
on
that
account
it
is
often
called
a
gift
of
the
gods
while
in
fact
everything
else
is
a
gift
of
the
gods
of
chance
this
however
is
the
man
himself
lonely
some
people
are
so
much
accustomed
to
being
alone
in
that
they
do
not
at
all
compare
themselves
with
others
but
spin
out
their
soliloquising
life
in
a
quiet
happy
mood
conversing
pleasantly
and
even
hilariously
with
themselves
if
however
they
are
brought
to
the
point
of
comparing
themselves
with
others
they
are
inclined
to
a
brooding
of
their
own
worth
so
that
they
have
first
to
be
compelled
by
others
once
more
a
good
and
just
opinion
of
themselves
and
even
from
this
acquired
opinion
they
will
always
want
to
subtract
and
abate
something
we
must
not
therefore
grudge
certain
persons
their
loneliness
or
foolishly
commiserate
them
on
that
account
as
is
so
often
done
without
there
are
persons
to
whom
a
constant
repose
in
themselves
and
the
harmonious
ordering
of
all
their
capacities
is
so
natural
that
every
definite
activity
is
repugnant
to
them
they
resemble
music
which
consists
of
nothing
but
prolonged
harmonious
accords
without
even
the
tendency
to
an
organised
and
animated
melody
showing
itself
all
external
movement
serves
only
to
restore
to
the
boat
its
equilibrium
on
the
sea
of
harmonious
euphony
modern
men
usually
become
excessively
impatient
when
they
meet
such
natures
who
never
be
anything
the
world
only
it
is
not
allowable
to
say
of
them
that
they
but
in
certain
moods
the
sight
of
them
raises
the
unusual
question
why
should
there
be
melody
at
all
why
should
it
not
suffice
us
when
life
mirrors
itself
peacefully
in
a
deep
lake
the
middle
ages
were
richer
in
such
natures
than
our
times
how
seldom
one
now
meets
with
any
one
who
can
live
on
so
peacefully
and
happily
with
himself
even
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
saying
to
himself
like
goethe
the
best
thing
of
all
is
the
deep
calm
in
which
i
live
and
grow
in
opposition
to
the
world
and
gain
what
it
can
not
take
away
from
me
with
fire
and
sword
to
live
and
if
we
observe
how
some
people
can
deal
with
their
experiences
their
unimportant
everyday
experiences
so
that
these
become
soil
which
yields
fruit
thrice
a
year
whilst
others
and
how
many
are
driven
through
the
surf
of
the
most
exciting
adventures
the
most
diversified
movements
of
times
and
peoples
and
yet
always
remain
light
always
remain
on
the
surface
like
cork
we
are
finally
tempted
to
divide
mankind
into
a
minority
minimality
of
those
who
know
how
to
make
much
out
of
little
and
a
majority
of
those
who
know
how
to
make
little
out
of
much
indeed
we
even
meet
with
the
who
instead
of
making
the
world
out
of
nothing
make
a
nothing
out
of
the
world
seriousness
in
genoa
one
evening
in
the
twilight
i
heard
from
a
tower
a
long
chiming
of
bells
it
was
never
like
to
end
and
sounded
as
if
insatiable
above
the
noise
of
the
streets
out
into
the
evening
sky
and
so
thrilling
and
at
the
same
time
so
childish
and
so
sad
i
then
remembered
the
words
of
plato
and
suddenly
felt
the
force
of
them
in
my
heart
matters
one
and
all
are
not
worthy
of
great
seriousness
nevertheless
conviction
and
the
requirement
that
a
person
must
afterwards
when
cool
and
sober
stand
by
what
he
says
promises
and
resolves
during
passion
is
one
of
the
heaviest
burdens
that
weigh
upon
mankind
to
have
to
acknowledge
for
all
future
time
the
consequences
of
anger
of
fiery
revenge
of
enthusiastic
devotion
may
lead
to
a
bitterness
against
these
feelings
proportionate
to
the
idolatry
with
which
they
are
idolised
especially
by
artists
these
cultivate
to
its
full
extent
the
of
the
passions
and
have
always
done
so
to
be
sure
they
also
glorify
the
terrible
satisfaction
of
the
passions
which
a
person
affords
himself
the
outbreaks
of
vengeance
with
death
mutilation
or
voluntary
banishment
in
their
train
and
the
resignation
of
the
broken
heart
in
any
case
they
keep
alive
curiosity
about
the
passions
it
is
as
if
they
said
without
passions
you
have
no
experience
whatever
because
we
have
sworn
fidelity
perhaps
even
to
a
purely
fictitious
being
such
as
a
god
because
we
have
surrendered
our
heart
to
a
prince
a
party
a
woman
a
priestly
order
an
artist
or
a
thinker
in
a
state
of
infatuated
delusion
that
threw
a
charm
over
us
and
made
those
beings
appear
worthy
of
all
veneration
and
every
sacrifice
are
we
therefore
firmly
and
inevitably
bound
or
did
we
not
after
all
deceive
ourselves
then
was
there
not
a
hypothetical
promise
under
the
tacit
presupposition
that
those
beings
to
whom
we
consecrated
ourselves
were
really
the
beings
they
seemed
to
be
in
our
imagination
are
we
under
obligation
to
be
faithful
to
our
errors
even
with
the
knowledge
that
by
this
fidelity
we
shall
cause
injury
to
our
higher
selves
no
there
is
no
law
no
obligation
of
that
sort
we
become
traitors
we
must
act
unfaithfully
and
abandon
our
ideals
again
and
again
we
can
not
advance
from
one
period
of
life
into
another
without
causing
these
pains
of
treachery
and
also
suffering
from
them
might
it
be
necessary
to
guard
against
the
ebullitions
of
our
feelings
in
order
to
escape
these
pains
would
not
the
world
then
become
too
arid
too
for
us
rather
will
we
ask
ourselves
whether
these
pains
are
on
a
change
of
convictions
or
whether
they
do
not
depend
on
a
opinion
and
estimate
why
do
we
admire
a
person
who
remains
true
to
his
convictions
and
despise
him
who
changes
them
i
fear
the
answer
must
be
because
every
one
takes
for
granted
that
such
a
change
is
caused
only
by
motives
of
more
general
utility
or
of
personal
trouble
that
is
to
say
we
believe
at
bottom
that
nobody
alters
his
opinions
as
long
as
they
are
advantageous
to
him
or
at
least
as
long
as
they
do
not
cause
him
any
harm
if
it
is
so
however
it
furnishes
a
bad
proof
of
the
significance
of
all
convictions
let
us
once
examine
how
convictions
arise
and
let
us
see
whether
their
importance
is
not
greatly
it
will
thereby
be
seen
that
the
of
convictions
also
is
in
all
circumstances
judged
according
to
a
false
standard
that
we
have
hitherto
been
accustomed
to
suffer
from
this
change
conviction
is
belief
in
the
possession
of
absolute
truth
on
any
matter
of
knowledge
this
belief
takes
it
for
granted
therefore
that
there
are
absolute
truths
also
that
perfect
methods
have
been
found
for
attaining
to
them
and
finally
that
every
one
who
has
convictions
makes
use
of
these
perfect
methods
all
three
notions
show
at
once
that
the
man
of
convictions
is
not
the
man
of
scientific
thought
he
seems
to
us
still
in
the
age
of
theoretical
innocence
and
is
practically
a
child
however
he
may
be
whole
centuries
however
have
been
lived
under
the
influence
of
those
childlike
presuppositions
and
out
of
them
have
flowed
the
mightiest
sources
of
human
strength
the
countless
numbers
who
sacrificed
themselves
for
their
convictions
believed
they
were
doing
it
for
the
sake
of
absolute
truth
they
were
all
wrong
however
probably
no
one
has
ever
sacrificed
himself
for
truth
at
least
the
dogmatic
expression
of
the
faith
of
any
such
person
has
been
unscientific
or
only
partly
scientific
but
really
people
wanted
to
carry
their
point
because
they
believed
that
they
in
the
right
to
allow
their
belief
to
be
wrested
from
them
probably
meant
calling
in
question
their
eternal
salvation
in
an
affair
of
such
extreme
importance
the
will
was
too
audibly
the
prompter
of
the
intellect
the
presupposition
of
every
believer
of
every
shade
of
belief
has
been
that
he
be
confuted
if
the
happened
to
be
very
strong
it
always
remained
for
him
to
decry
intellect
generally
and
perhaps
even
to
set
up
the
quia
absurdum
as
the
standard
of
extreme
fanaticism
it
is
not
the
struggle
of
opinions
that
has
made
history
so
turbulent
but
the
struggle
of
belief
in
opinions
that
is
to
say
of
convictions
if
all
those
who
thought
so
highly
of
their
convictions
who
made
sacrifices
of
all
kinds
for
them
and
spared
neither
honour
body
nor
life
in
their
service
had
only
devoted
half
of
their
energy
to
examining
their
right
to
adhere
to
this
or
that
conviction
and
by
what
road
they
arrived
at
it
how
peaceable
would
the
history
of
mankind
now
appear
how
much
more
knowledge
would
there
be
all
the
cruel
scenes
in
connection
with
the
persecution
of
heretics
of
all
kinds
would
have
been
avoided
for
two
reasons
firstly
because
the
inquisitors
would
above
all
have
inquired
of
themselves
and
would
have
recognised
the
presumption
of
defending
absolute
truth
and
secondly
because
the
heretics
themselves
would
after
examination
have
taken
no
more
interest
in
such
badly
established
doctrines
as
those
of
all
religious
sectarians
and
orthodox
believers
from
the
ages
in
which
it
was
customary
to
believe
in
the
possession
of
absolute
truth
people
have
inherited
a
profound
of
all
sceptical
and
relative
attitudes
with
regard
to
questions
of
knowledge
they
mostly
prefer
to
acquiesce
for
good
or
evil
in
the
convictions
of
those
in
authority
fathers
friends
teachers
princes
and
they
have
a
kind
of
remorse
of
conscience
when
they
do
not
do
so
this
tendency
is
quite
comprehensible
and
its
results
furnish
no
ground
for
condemnation
of
the
course
of
the
development
of
human
reason
the
scientific
spirit
in
man
however
has
gradually
to
bring
to
maturity
the
virtue
of
forbearance
the
wise
moderation
which
is
better
known
in
practical
than
in
theoretical
life
and
which
for
instance
goethe
has
represented
in
antonio
as
an
object
of
provocation
for
all
tassos
that
is
to
say
for
unscientific
and
at
the
same
time
inactive
natures
the
man
of
convictions
has
in
himself
the
right
not
to
comprehend
the
man
of
cautious
thought
the
theoretical
antonio
the
scientific
man
on
the
other
hand
has
no
right
to
blame
the
former
on
that
account
he
takes
no
notice
thereof
and
knows
moreover
that
in
certain
cases
the
former
will
yet
cling
to
him
as
tasso
finally
clung
to
antonio
he
who
has
not
passed
through
different
phases
of
conviction
but
sticks
to
the
faith
in
whose
net
he
was
first
caught
is
under
all
circumstances
just
on
account
of
this
unchangeableness
a
representative
of
culture
in
accordance
with
this
lack
of
culture
which
always
presupposes
plasticity
for
culture
he
is
severe
unintelligent
unteachable
without
liberality
an
ever
suspicious
person
an
unscrupulous
person
who
has
recourse
to
all
expedients
for
enforcing
his
opinions
because
he
can
not
conceive
that
there
must
be
other
opinions
he
is
in
such
respects
perhaps
a
source
of
strength
and
even
wholesome
in
cultures
that
have
become
too
emancipated
and
languid
but
only
because
he
strongly
incites
to
opposition
for
thereby
the
delicate
organisation
of
the
new
culture
which
is
forced
to
struggle
with
him
becomes
strong
itself
in
essential
respects
we
are
still
the
same
men
as
those
of
the
time
of
the
reformation
how
could
it
be
otherwise
but
the
fact
that
we
allow
ourselves
certain
means
for
promoting
the
triumph
of
our
opinions
distinguishes
us
from
that
age
and
proves
that
we
belong
to
a
higher
culture
he
who
still
combats
and
overthrows
opinions
with
calumnies
and
outbursts
of
rage
after
the
manner
of
the
reformation
men
obviously
betrays
the
fact
that
he
would
have
burnt
his
adversaries
had
he
lived
in
other
times
and
that
he
would
have
resorted
to
all
the
methods
of
the
inquisition
if
he
had
been
an
opponent
of
the
reformation
the
inquisition
was
rational
at
that
time
for
it
represented
nothing
else
than
the
universal
application
of
martial
law
which
had
to
be
proclaimed
throughout
the
entire
domain
of
the
church
and
which
like
all
martial
law
gave
a
right
to
the
extremest
methods
under
the
presupposition
of
course
which
we
now
no
longer
share
with
those
people
that
the
church
truth
and
had
to
preserve
it
at
all
costs
and
at
any
sacrifice
for
the
salvation
of
mankind
now
however
one
does
not
so
readily
concede
to
any
one
that
he
possesses
the
truth
strict
methods
of
investigation
have
diffused
enough
of
distrust
and
precaution
so
that
every
one
who
violently
advocates
opinions
in
word
and
deed
is
looked
upon
as
an
enemy
of
our
modern
culture
or
at
least
as
an
atavist
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
pathos
that
man
possesses
truth
is
now
of
very
little
consequence
in
comparison
with
the
certainly
milder
and
less
noisy
pathos
of
the
search
for
truth
which
is
never
weary
of
learning
afresh
and
examining
anew
moreover
the
methodical
search
for
truth
is
itself
the
outcome
of
those
ages
in
which
convictions
were
at
war
with
each
other
if
the
individual
had
not
cared
about
truth
that
is
to
say
about
carrying
his
point
there
would
have
been
no
method
of
investigation
thus
however
by
the
eternal
struggle
of
the
claims
of
different
individuals
to
absolute
truth
people
went
on
step
by
step
to
find
irrefragable
principles
according
to
which
the
rights
of
the
claims
could
be
tested
and
the
dispute
settled
at
first
people
decided
according
to
authorities
later
on
they
criticised
one
another
ways
and
means
of
finding
the
presumed
truth
in
the
interval
there
was
a
period
when
people
deduced
the
consequences
of
the
adverse
theory
and
perhaps
found
them
to
be
productive
of
injury
and
unhappiness
from
which
it
was
then
to
be
inferred
by
every
one
that
the
conviction
of
the
adversary
involved
an
error
the
struggle
of
the
at
last
so
sharpened
his
methods
that
real
truths
could
be
discovered
and
the
mistakes
of
former
methods
exposed
before
the
eyes
of
all
on
the
whole
scientific
methods
are
at
least
as
important
results
of
investigation
as
any
other
results
for
the
scientific
spirit
is
based
upon
a
knowledge
of
method
and
if
the
methods
were
lost
all
the
results
of
science
could
not
prevent
the
renewed
prevalence
of
superstition
and
absurdity
clever
people
may
as
much
as
they
like
of
the
results
of
science
but
one
still
notices
in
their
conversation
and
especially
in
the
hypotheses
they
make
that
they
lack
the
scientific
spirit
they
have
not
the
instinctive
distrust
of
the
devious
courses
of
thinking
which
in
consequence
of
long
training
has
taken
root
in
the
soul
of
every
scientific
man
it
is
enough
for
them
to
find
any
kind
of
hypothesis
on
a
subject
they
are
then
all
on
fire
for
it
and
imagine
the
matter
is
thereby
settled
to
have
an
opinion
is
with
them
equivalent
to
immediately
becoming
fanatical
for
it
and
finally
taking
it
to
heart
as
a
conviction
in
the
case
of
an
unexplained
matter
they
become
heated
for
the
first
idea
that
comes
into
their
head
which
has
any
resemblance
to
an
explanation
a
course
from
which
the
worst
results
constantly
follow
especially
in
the
field
of
politics
on
that
account
everybody
should
nowadays
have
become
thoroughly
acquainted
with
at
least
science
for
then
surely
he
knows
what
is
meant
by
method
and
how
necessary
is
the
extremest
carefulness
to
women
in
particular
this
advice
is
to
be
given
at
present
as
to
those
who
are
irretrievably
the
victims
of
all
hypotheses
especially
when
these
have
the
appearance
of
being
witty
attractive
enlivening
and
invigorating
indeed
on
close
inspection
one
sees
that
by
far
the
greater
number
of
educated
people
still
desire
convictions
from
a
thinker
and
nothing
but
and
that
only
a
small
minority
want
the
former
want
to
be
forcibly
carried
away
in
order
thereby
to
obtain
an
increase
of
strength
the
latter
few
have
the
real
interest
which
disregards
personal
advantages
and
the
increase
of
strength
also
the
former
class
who
greatly
predominate
are
always
reckoned
upon
when
the
thinker
comports
himself
and
labels
himself
as
a
and
thus
views
himself
as
a
higher
being
to
whom
authority
belongs
in
so
far
as
genius
of
this
kind
upholds
the
ardour
of
convictions
and
arouses
distrust
of
the
cautious
and
modest
spirit
of
science
it
is
an
enemy
of
truth
however
much
it
may
think
itself
the
wooer
thereof
there
is
certainly
also
an
entirely
different
species
of
genius
that
of
justice
and
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
to
estimate
it
lower
than
any
kind
of
philosophical
political
or
artistic
genius
its
peculiarity
is
to
go
with
heartfelt
aversion
out
of
the
way
of
everything
that
blinds
and
confuses
people
judgment
of
things
it
is
consequently
an
of
convictions
for
it
wants
to
give
their
own
to
all
whether
they
be
living
or
dead
real
or
imaginary
and
for
that
purpose
it
must
know
thoroughly
it
therefore
places
everything
in
the
best
light
and
goes
around
it
with
careful
eyes
finally
it
will
even
give
to
its
adversary
the
blind
or
conviction
as
men
call
it
among
women
it
is
called
faith
what
is
due
to
conviction
for
the
sake
of
truth
opinions
evolve
out
of
indolence
of
allows
those
to
congeal
into
he
however
who
is
conscious
of
himself
as
a
restless
lively
spirit
can
prevent
this
congelation
by
constant
change
and
if
he
is
altogether
a
thinking
snowball
he
will
not
have
opinions
in
his
head
at
all
but
only
certainties
and
properly
estimated
probabilities
but
we
who
are
of
a
mixed
nature
alternately
inspired
with
ardour
and
chilled
through
and
through
by
the
intellect
want
to
kneel
before
justice
as
the
only
goddess
we
acknowledge
the
in
us
generally
makes
us
unjust
and
impure
in
the
eyes
of
our
goddess
in
this
condition
we
are
not
permitted
to
take
her
hand
and
the
serious
smile
of
her
approval
never
rests
upon
us
we
reverence
her
as
the
veiled
isis
of
our
life
with
shame
we
offer
her
our
pain
as
penance
and
sacrifice
when
the
fire
threatens
to
burn
and
consume
us
it
is
the
that
saves
us
from
being
utterly
burnt
and
reduced
to
ashes
it
occasionally
drags
us
away
from
the
sacrificial
altar
of
justice
or
enwraps
us
in
a
garment
of
asbestos
liberated
from
the
fire
and
impelled
by
the
intellect
we
then
pass
from
opinion
to
opinion
through
the
change
of
parties
as
noble
of
all
things
that
can
in
any
way
be
betrayed
and
nevertheless
without
a
feeling
of
guilt
the
he
who
has
attained
intellectual
emancipation
to
any
extent
can
not
for
a
long
time
regard
himself
otherwise
than
as
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
not
even
as
a
traveller
a
final
goal
for
there
is
no
such
thing
but
he
certainly
wants
to
observe
and
keep
his
eyes
open
to
whatever
actually
happens
in
the
world
therefore
he
can
not
attach
his
heart
too
firmly
to
anything
individual
he
must
have
in
himself
something
wandering
that
takes
pleasure
in
change
and
transitoriness
to
be
sure
such
a
man
will
have
bad
nights
when
he
is
weary
and
finds
the
gates
of
the
town
that
should
offer
him
rest
closed
perhaps
he
may
also
find
that
as
in
the
east
the
desert
reaches
to
the
gates
that
wild
beasts
howl
far
and
near
that
a
strong
wind
arises
and
that
robbers
take
away
his
beasts
of
burden
then
the
dreadful
night
closes
over
him
like
a
second
desert
upon
the
desert
and
his
heart
grows
weary
of
wandering
then
when
the
morning
sun
rises
upon
him
glowing
like
a
deity
of
anger
when
the
town
is
opened
he
sees
perhaps
in
the
faces
of
the
dwellers
therein
still
more
desert
uncleanliness
deceit
and
insecurity
than
outside
the
gates
and
the
day
is
almost
worse
than
the
night
thus
it
may
occasionally
happen
to
the
wanderer
but
then
there
come
as
compensation
the
delightful
mornings
of
other
lands
and
days
when
already
in
the
grey
of
the
dawn
he
sees
the
throng
of
muses
dancing
by
close
to
him
in
the
mist
of
the
mountain
when
afterwards
in
the
symmetry
of
his
soul
he
strolls
silently
under
the
trees
out
of
whose
crests
and
leafy
all
manner
of
good
and
bright
things
are
flung
to
him
the
gifts
of
all
the
free
spirits
who
are
at
home
in
mountains
forests
and
solitudes
and
who
like
himself
alternately
merry
and
thoughtful
are
wanderers
and
philosophers
born
of
the
secrets
of
the
early
dawn
they
ponder
the
question
how
the
day
between
the
hours
of
ten
and
twelve
can
have
such
a
pure
transparent
and
gloriously
cheerful
countenance
they
seek
the
philosophy
footnote
this
is
why
nietzsche
pointed
out
later
on
that
he
had
an
interest
in
the
preservation
of
christianity
and
that
he
was
sure
his
teaching
would
not
undermine
this
faith
just
as
little
as
anarchists
have
undermined
kings

have
left
them
