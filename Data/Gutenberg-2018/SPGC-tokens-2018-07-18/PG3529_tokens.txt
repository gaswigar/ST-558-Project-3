rid
of
about
ten
thousand
pounds
which
had
been
left

by
his
father
he
began
to
get
rid
of
it
by
farming
mary
wollstonecraft
home
was
in
a
farm
at
epping
when
she
was
five
years
old
the
family
moved
to
another
farm
by
the
chelmsford
road
when
she
was
between
six
and
seven
years
old
they
moved
again
to
the
neighbourhood

a
farm
near
beverley
in
yorkshire
in
yorkshire
they
remained
six
years
and
mary
wollstonecraft
had
there
what
education
fell
to
her
lot
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
sixteen
edward
john
wollstonecraft
then
gave
up
farming
to
venture
upon
a
commercial
speculation
this
caused
him
to
live
for
a
year
and
a
half
at
queen
row
hoxton
his
daughter
mary
was
then
sixteen
and
while
at
hoxton
she
had
her
education
advanced
by
the
friendly
care
of
a
deformed
clergyman
a
clare
who
lived
next
door
and
stayed
so
much
at
home
that
his
one
pair
of
shoes
had
lasted
him
for
fourteen
years
but
mary
wollstonecraft
chief
friend
at
this
time
was
an
accomplished
girl
only
two
years
older
than
herself
who
maintained
her
father
mother
and
family
by
skill
in
drawing
her
name
was
frances
blood
and
she
especially
by
her
example
and
direct
instruction
drew
out
her
young
friend
powers
in
mary
wollstonecraft
father
a
rolling
stone
rolled
into
wales
again
he
was
a
farmer
next
year
again
he
was
a
londoner
and
mary
had
influence
enough
to
persuade
him
to
choose
a
house
at
walworth
where
she
would
be
near
to
her
friend
fanny
then
however
the
conditions
of
her
home
life
caused
her
to
be
often
on
the
point
of
going
away
to
earn
a
living
for
herself
in
when
she
was
nineteen
mary
wollstonecraft
did
leave
home
to
take
a
situation
as
companion
with
a
rich
tradesman
widow
at
bath
of
whom
it
was
said
that
none
of
her
companions
could
stay
with
her
mary
wollstonecraft
nevertheless
stayed
two
years
with
the
difficult
widow
and
made
herself
respected
her
mother
failing
health
then
caused
mary
to
return
to
her
the
father
was
then
living
at
enfield
and
trying
to
save
the
small
remainder
of
his
means
by
not
venturing
upon
any
business
at
all
the
mother
died
after
long
suffering
wholly
dependent
on
her
daughter
mary
constant
care
the
mother
last
words
were
often
quoted
by
mary
wollstonecraft
in
her
own
last
years
of
distress
a
little
patience
and
all
will
be
over
after
the
mother
death
mary
wollstonecraft
left
home
again
to
live
with
her
friend
fanny
blood
who
was
at
walham
green
in
she
went
to
nurse
a
married
sister
through
a
dangerous
illness
the
father
need
of
support
next
pressed
upon
her
he
had
spent
not
only
his
own
money
but
also
the
little
that
had
been
specially
reserved
for
his
children
it
is
said
to
be
the
privilege
of
a
passionate
man
that
he
always
gets
what
he
wants
he
gets
to
be
avoided
and
they
never
find
a
convenient
corner
of
their
own
who
shut
themselves
out
from
the
kindly
fellowship
of
life
in
mary
wollstonecraft
aged
with
two
of
her
sisters
joined
fanny
blood
in
setting
up
a
day
school
at
islington
which
was
removed
in
a
few
months
to
newington
green
early
in
fanny
blood
far
gone
in
consumption
sailed
for
lisbon
to
marry
an
irish
surgeon
who
was
settled
there
after
her
marriage
it
was
evident
that
she
had
but
a
few
months
to
live
mary
wollstonecraft
deaf
to
all
opposing
counsel
then
left
her
school
and
with
help
of
money
from
a
friendly
woman
she
went
out
to
nurse
her
and
was
by
her
when
she
died
mary
wollstonecraft
remembered
her
loss
ten
years
afterwards
in
these
letters
from
sweden
and
norway
when
she
wrote
the
grave
has
closed
over
a
dear
friend
the
friend
of
my
youth
still
she
is
present
with
me
and
i
hear
her
soft
voice
warbling
as
i
stray
over
the
heath
mary
wollstonecraft
left
lisbon
for
england
late
in
december
when
she
came
back
she
found
fanny
poor
parents
anxious
to
go
back
to
ireland
and
as
she
had
been
often
told
that
she
could
earn
by
writing
she
wrote
a
pamphlet
of
small
pages
thoughts
on
the
education
of
daughters
and
got
ten
pounds
for
it
this
she
gave
to
her
parents
to
enable
them
to
go
back
to
their
kindred
in
all
she
did
there
is
clear
evidence
of
an
ardent
generous
impulsive
nature
one
day
her
friend
fanny
blood
had
repined
at
the
unhappy
surroundings
in
the
home
she
was
maintaining
for
her
father
and
mother
and
longed
for
a
little
home
of
her
own
to
do
her
work
in
her
friend
quietly
found
rooms
got
furniture
together
and
told
her
that
her
little
home
was
ready
she
had
only
to
walk
into
it
then
it
seemed
strange
to
mary
wollstonecraft
that
fanny
blood
was
withheld
by
thoughts
that
had
not
been
uppermost
in
the
mood
of
complaint
she
thought
her
friend
irresolute
where
she
had
herself
been
generously
rash
her
end
would
have
been
happier
had
she
been
helped
as
many
are
by
that
calm
influence
of
home
in
which
some
knowledge
of
the
world
passes
from
father
and
mother
to
son
and
daughter
without
visible
teaching
and
preaching
in
easiest
companionship
of
young
and
old
from
day
to
day
the
little
payment
for
her
pamphlet
on
the
education
of
daughters
caused
mary
wollstonecraft
to
think
more
seriously
of
earning
by
her
pen
the
pamphlet
seems
also
to
have
advanced
her
credit
as
a
teacher
after
giving
up
her
day
school
she
spent
some
weeks
at
eton
with
the
rev
mr
prior
one
of
the
masters
there
who
recommended
her
as
governess
to
the
daughters
of
lord
kingsborough
an
irish
viscount
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
kingston
her
way
of
teaching
was
by
winning
love
and
she
obtained
the
warm
affection
of
the
eldest
of
her
pupils
who
became
afterwards
countess
in
the
summer
of
lord
family
including
mary
wollstonecraft
was
at
bristol
before
going
to
the
continent
while
there
mary
wollstonecraft
wrote
her
little
tale
published
as
mary
a
fiction
wherein
there
was
much
based
on
the
memory
of
her
own
friendship
for
fanny
blood
the
publisher
of
mary
wollstonecraft
thoughts
on
the
education
of
daughters
was
the
same
joseph
johnson
who
in
was
the
publisher
of
cowper
task
with
her
little
story
written
and
a
little
money
saved
the
resolve
to
live
by
her
pen
could
now
be
carried
out
mary
wollstonecraft
therefore
parted
from
her
friends
at
bristol
went
to
london
saw
her
publisher
and
frankly
told
him
her
determination
he
met
her
with
fatherly
kindness
and
received
her
as
a
guest
in
his
house
while
she
was
making
her
arrangements
at
michaelmas
she
settled
in
a
house
in
george
street
on
the
surrey
side
of
blackfriars
bridge
there
she
produced
a
little
book
for
children
of
original
stories
from
real
life
and
earned
by
drudgery
for
joseph
johnson
she
translated
she
abridged
she
made
a
volume
of
selections
and
she
wrote
for
an
analytical
review
which
johnson
founded
in
the
middle
of
the
year
among
the
books
translated
by
her
was
necker
on
the
importance
of
religious
opinions
among
the
books
abridged
by
her
was
elements
of
morality
with
all
this
hard
work
she
lived
as
sparely
as
she
could
that
she
might
help
her
family
she
supported
her
father
that
she
might
enable
her
sisters
to
earn
their
living
as
teachers
she
sent
one
of
them
to
paris
and
maintained
her
there
for
two
years
the
other
she
placed
in
a
school
near
london
as
until
she
was
admitted
into
it
as
a
paid
teacher
she
placed
one
brother
at
woolwich
to
qualify
for
the
navy
and
he
obtained
a
lieutenant
commission
for
another
brother
articled
to
an
attorney
whom
he
did
not
like
she
obtained
a
transfer
of
indentures
and
when
it
became
clear
that
his
quarrel
was
more
with
law
than
with
the
lawyers
she
placed
him
with
a
farmer
before
fitting
him
out
for
emigration
to
america
she
then
sent
him
so
well
prepared
for
his
work
there
that
he
prospered
well
she
tried
even
to
disentangle
her
father
affairs
but
the
confusion
in
them
was
beyond
her
powers
of
arrangement
added
to
all
this
faithful
work
she
took
upon
herself
the
charge
of
an
orphan
child
seven
years
old
whose
mother
had
been
in
the
number
of
her
friends
that
was
the
life
of
mary
wollstonecraft
thirty
years
old
in
the
year
of
the
fall
of
the
bastille
the
noble
life
now
to
be
touched
in
its
enthusiasms
by
the
spirit
of
the
revolution
to
be
caught
in
the
great
storm
shattered
and
lost
among
its
wrecks
to
burke
attack
on
the
french
revolution
mary
wollstonecraft
wrote
an
answer
one
of
many
answers
provoked
by
it
that
attracted
much
attention
this
was
followed
by
her
vindication
of
the
rights
of
woman
while
the
air
was
full
of
declamation
on
the
rights
of
man
the
claims
made
in
this
little
book
were
in
advance
of
the
opinion
of
that
day
but
they
are
claims
that
have
in
our
day
been
conceded
they
are
certainly
not
revolutionary
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
that
has
become
a
hundred
years
older
since
the
book
was
written
at
this
the
mary
wollstonecraft
had
moved
to
rooms
in
store
street
bedford
square
she
was
fascinated
by
fuseli
the
painter
and
he
was
a
married
man
she
felt
herself
to
be
too
strongly
drawn
towards
him
and
she
went
to
paris
at
the
close
of
the
year
to
break
the
spell
she
felt
lonely
and
sad
and
was
not
the
happier
for
being
in
a
mansion
lent
to
her
from
which
the
owner
was
away
and
in
which
she
lived
surrounded
by
his
servants
strong
womanly
instincts
were
astir
within
her
and
they
were
not
all
wise
folk
who
had
been
drawn
around
her
by
her
generous
enthusiasm
for
the
new
hopes
of
the
world
that
made
it
then
as
wordsworth
felt
a
very
heaven
to
the
young
four
months
after
she
had
gone
to
paris
mary
wollstonecraft
met
at
the
house
of
a
merchant
with
whose
wife
she
had
become
intimate
an
american
named
gilbert
imlay
he
won
her
affections
that
was
in
april
he
had
no
means
and
she
had
home
embarrassments
for
which
she
was
unwilling
that
he
should
become
in
any
way
responsible
a
part
of
the
new
dream
in
some
minds
then
was
of
a
love
too
pure
to
need
or
bear
the
bondage
of
authority
the
mere
forced
union
of
marriage
ties
implied
it
was
said
a
distrust
of
fidelity
when
gilbert
imlay
would
have
married
mary
wollstonecraft
she
herself
refused
to
bind
him
she
would
keep
him
legally
exempt
from
her
responsibilities
towards
the
father
sisters
brothers
whom
she
was
supporting
she
took
his
name
and
called
herself
his
wife
when
the
french
convention
indignant
at
the
conduct
of
the
british
government
issue
a
decree
from
the
effects
of
which
she
would
escape
as
the
wife
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
but
she
did
not
marry
she
witnessed
many
of
the
horrors
that
came
of
the
loosened
passions
of
an
untaught
populace
a
child
was
born
to
her
a
girl
whom
she
named
after
the
dead
friend
of
her
own
girlhood
and
then
she
found
that
she
had
leant
upon
a
reed
she
was
neglected
and
was
at
last
forsaken
having
sent
her
to
london
imlay
there
visited
her
to
explain
himself
away
she
resolved
on
suicide
and
in
dissuading
her
from
that
he
gave
her
hope
again
he
needed
somebody
who
had
good
judgment
and
who
cared
for
his
interests
to
represent
him
in
some
business
affairs
in
norway
she
undertook
to
act
for
him
and
set
out
on
the
voyage
only
a
week
after
she
had
determined
to
destroy
herself
the
interest
of
this
book
which
describes
her
travel
is
quickened
by
a
knowledge
of
the
that
underlies
it
all
gilbert
imlay
had
promised
to
meet
her
upon
her
return
and
go
with
her
to
switzerland
but
the
letters
she
had
from
him
in
sweden
and
norway
were
cold
and
she
came
back
to
find
that
she
was
wholly
forsaken
for
an
actress
from
a
strolling
company
of
players
then
she
went
up
the
river
to
drown
herself
she
paced
the
road
at
putney
on
an
october
night
in
in
heavy
rain
until
her
clothes
were
drenched
that
she
might
sink
more
surely
and
then
threw
herself
from
the
top
of
putney
bridge
she
was
rescued
and
lived
on
with
deadened
spirit
in
these
letters
from
sweden
and
norway
were
published
early
in
she
was
married
to
william
godwin
on
the
of
september
in
the
same
year
at
the
age
of
mary
wollstonecraft
godwin
died
after
the
birth
of
the
daughter
who
lived
to
become
the
wife
of
shelley
the
mother
also
would
have
lived
if
a
womanly
feeling
in
itself
to
be
respected
had
not
led
her
also
to
unwise
departure
from
the
customs
of
the
world
peace
be
to
her
memory
none
but
kind
thoughts
can
dwell
upon
the
life
of
this
too
faithful
disciple
of
rousseau
letter
eleven
days
of
weariness
on
board
a
vessel
not
intended
for
the
accommodation
of
passengers
have
so
exhausted
my
spirits
to
say
nothing
of
the
other
causes
with
which
you
are
already
sufficiently
acquainted
that
it
is
with
some
difficulty
i
adhere
to
my
determination
of
giving
you
my
observations
as
i
travel
through
new
scenes
whilst
warmed
with
the
impression
they
have
made
on
me
the
captain
as
i
mentioned
to
you
promised
to
put
me
on
shore
at
arendall
or
gothenburg
in
his
way
to
elsineur
but
contrary
winds
obliged
us
to
pass
both
places
during
the
night
in
the
morning
however
after
we
had
lost
sight
of
the
entrance
of
the
latter
bay
the
vessel
was
becalmed
and
the
captain
to
oblige
me
hanging
out
a
signal
for
a
pilot
bore
down
towards
the
shore
my
attention
was
particularly
directed
to
the
lighthouse
and
you
can
scarcely
imagine
with
what
anxiety
i
watched
two
long
hours
for
a
boat
to
emancipate
me
still
no
one
appeared
every
cloud
that
flitted
on
the
horizon
was
hailed
as
a
liberator
till
approaching
nearer
like
most
of
the
prospects
sketched
by
hope
it
dissolved
under
the
eye
into
disappointment
weary
of
expectation
i
then
began
to
converse
with
the
captain
on
the
subject
and
from
the
tenor
of
the
information
my
questions
drew
forth
i
soon
concluded
that
if
i
waited
for
a
boat
i
had
little
chance
of
getting
on
shore
at
this
place
despotism
as
is
usually
the
case
i
found
had
here
cramped
the
industry
of
man
the
pilots
being
paid
by
the
king
and
scantily
they
will
not
run
into
any
danger
or
even
quit
their
hovels
if
they
can
possibly
avoid
it
only
to
fulfil
what
is
termed
their
duty
how
different
is
it
on
the
english
coast
where
in
the
most
stormy
weather
boats
immediately
hail
you
brought
out
by
the
expectation
of
extraordinary
profit
disliking
to
sail
for
elsineur
and
still
more
to
lie
at
anchor
or
cruise
about
the
coast
for
several
days
i
exerted
all
my
rhetoric
to
prevail
on
the
captain
to
let
me
have
the
ship
boat
and
though
i
added
the
most
forcible
of
arguments
i
for
a
long
the
addressed
him
in
vain
it
is
a
kind
of
rule
at
sea
not
to
send
out
a
boat
the
captain
was
a
man
but
men
with
common
minds
seldom
break
through
general
rules
prudence
is
ever
the
resort
of
weakness
and
they
rarely
go
as
far
as
they
may
in
any
undertaking
who
are
determined
not
to
go
beyond
it
on
any
account
if
however
i
had
some
trouble
with
the
captain
i
did
not
lose
much
time
with
the
sailors
for
they
all
alacrity
hoisted
out
the
boat
the
moment
i
obtained
permission
and
promised
to
row
me
to
the
lighthouse
i
did
not
once
allow
myself
to
doubt
of
obtaining
a
conveyance
from
thence
round
the
rocks
and
then
away
for
gothenburg
confinement
is
so
unpleasant
the
day
was
fine
and
i
enjoyed
the
water
till
approaching
the
little
island
poor
marguerite
whose
timidity
always
acts
as
a
feeler
before
her
adventuring
spirit
began
to
wonder
at
our
not
seeing
any
inhabitants
i
did
not
listen
to
her
but
when
on
landing
the
same
silence
prevailed
i
caught
the
alarm
which
was
not
lessened
by
the
sight
of
two
old
men
whom
we
forced
out
of
their
wretched
hut
scarcely
human
in
their
appearance
we
with
difficulty
obtained
an
intelligible
reply
to
our
questions
the
result
of
which
was
that
they
had
no
boat
and
were
not
allowed
to
quit
their
post
on
any
pretence
but
they
informed
us
that
there
was
at
the
other
side
eight
or
ten
miles
over
a
pilot
dwelling
two
guineas
tempted
the
sailors
to
risk
the
displeasure
and
once
more
embark
to
row
me
over
the
weather
was
pleasant
and
the
appearance
of
the
shore
so
grand
that
i
should
have
enjoyed
the
two
hours
it
took
to
reach
it
but
for
the
fatigue
which
was
too
visible
in
the
countenances
of
the
sailors
who
instead
of
uttering
a
complaint
were
with
the
thoughtless
hilarity
peculiar
to
them
joking
about
the
possibility
of
the
captain
taking
advantage
of
a
slight
westerly
breeze
which
was
springing
up
to
sail
without
them
yet
in
spite
of
their
good
humour
i
could
not
help
growing
uneasy
when
the
shore
receding
as
it
were
as
we
advanced
seemed
to
promise
no
end
to
their
toil
this
anxiety
increased
when
turning
into
the
most
picturesque
bay
i
ever
saw
my
eyes
sought
in
vain
for
the
vestige
of
a
human
habitation
before
i
could
determine
what
step
to
take
in
such
a
dilemma
for
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
returning
to
the
ship
the
sight
of
a
barge
relieved
me
and
we
hastened
towards
it
for
information
we
were
immediately
directed
to
pass
some
jutting
rocks
when
we
should
see
a
pilot
hut
there
was
a
solemn
silence
in
this
scene
which
made
itself
be
felt
the
sunbeams
that
played
on
the
ocean
scarcely
ruffled
by
the
lightest
breeze
contrasted
with
the
huge
dark
rocks
that
looked
like
the
rude
materials
of
creation
forming
the
barrier
of
unwrought
space
forcibly
struck
me
but
i
should
not
have
been
sorry
if
the
cottage
had
not
appeared
equally
tranquil
approaching
a
retreat
where
strangers
especially
women
so
seldom
appeared
i
wondered
that
curiosity
did
not
bring
the
beings
who
inhabited
it
to
the
windows
or
door
i
did
not
immediately
recollect
that
men
who
remain
so
near
the
brute
creation
as
only
to
exert
themselves
to
find
the
food
necessary
to
sustain
life
have
little
or
no
imagination
to
call
forth
the
curiosity
necessary
to
fructify
the
faint
glimmerings
of
mind
which
entitle
them
to
rank
as
lords
of
the
creation
had
they
either
they
could
not
contentedly
remain
rooted
in
the
clods
they
so
indolently
cultivate
whilst
the
sailors
went
to
seek
for
the
sluggish
inhabitants
these
conclusions
occurred
to
me
and
recollecting
the
extreme
fondness
which
the
parisians
ever
testify
for
novelty
their
very
curiosity
appeared
to
me
a
proof
of
the
progress
they
had
made
in
refinement
yes
in
the
art
of
living
in
the
art
of
escaping
from
the
cares
which
embarrass
the
first
steps
towards
the
attainment
of
the
pleasures
of
social
life
the
pilots
informed
the
sailors
that
they
were
under
the
direction
of
a
lieutenant
retired
from
the
service
who
spoke
english
adding
that
they
could
do
nothing
without
his
orders
and
even
the
offer
of
money
could
hardly
conquer
their
laziness
and
prevail
on
them
to
accompany
us
to
his
dwelling
they
would
not
go
with
me
alone
which
i
wanted
them
to
have
done
because
i
wished
to
dismiss
the
sailors
as
soon
as
possible
once
more
we
rowed
off
they
following
tardily
till
turning
round
another
bold
protuberance
of
the
rocks
we
saw
a
boat
making
towards
us
and
soon
learnt
that
it
was
the
lieutenant
himself
coming
with
some
earnestness
to
see
who
we
were
to
save
the
sailors
any
further
toil
i
had
my
baggage
instantly
removed
into
his
boat
for
as
he
could
speak
english
a
previous
parley
was
not
necessary
though
marguerite
respect
for
me
could
hardly
keep
her
from
expressing
the
fear
strongly
marked
on
her
countenance
which
my
putting
ourselves
into
the
power
of
a
strange
man
excited
he
pointed
out
his
cottage
and
drawing
near
to
it
i
was
not
sorry
to
see
a
female
figure
though
i
had
not
like
marguerite
been
thinking
of
robberies
murders
or
the
other
evil
which
instantly
as
the
sailors
would
have
said
runs
foul
of
a
woman
imagination
on
entering
i
was
still
better
pleased
to
find
a
clean
house
with
some
degree
of
rural
elegance
the
beds
were
of
muslin
coarse
it
is
true
but
dazzlingly
white
and
the
floor
was
strewed
over
with
little
sprigs
of
juniper
the
custom
as
i
afterwards
found
of
the
country
which
formed
a
contrast
with
the
curtains
and
produced
an
agreeable
sensation
of
freshness
to
soften
the
ardour
of
noon
still
nothing
was
so
pleasing
as
the
alacrity
of
hospitality
all
that
the
house
afforded
was
quickly
spread
on
the
whitest
linen
remember
i
had
just
left
the
vessel
where
without
being
fastidious
i
had
continually
been
disgusted
fish
milk
butter
and
cheese
and
i
am
sorry
to
add
brandy
the
bane
of
this
country
were
spread
on
the
board
after
we
had
dined
hospitality
made
them
with
some
degree
of
mystery
bring
us
some
excellent
coffee
i
did
not
then
know
that
it
was
prohibited
the
good
man
of
the
house
apologised
for
coming
in
continually
but
declared
that
he
was
so
glad
to
speak
english
he
could
not
stay
out
he
need
not
have
apologised
i
was
equally
glad
of
his
company
with
the
wife
i
could
only
exchange
smiles
and
she
was
employed
observing
the
make
of
our
clothes
my
hands
i
found
had
first
led
her
to
discover
that
i
was
the
lady
i
had
of
course
my
quantum
of
reverences
for
the
politeness
of
the
north
seems
to
partake
of
the
coldness
of
the
climate
and
the
rigidity
of
its
rocks
amongst
the
peasantry
there
is
however
so
much
of
the
simplicity
of
the
golden
age
in
this
land
of
flint
so
much
overflowing
of
heart
and
that
only
benevolence
and
the
honest
sympathy
of
nature
diffused
smiles
over
my
countenance
when
they
kept
me
standing
regardless
of
my
fatigue
whilst
they
dropped
courtesy
after
courtesy
the
situation
of
this
house
was
beautiful
though
chosen
for
convenience
the
master
being
the
officer
who
commanded
all
the
pilots
on
the
coast
and
the
person
appointed
to
guard
wrecks
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
fix
on
a
spot
that
would
overlook
the
whole
bay
as
he
had
seen
some
service
he
wore
not
without
a
pride
i
thought
becoming
a
badge
to
prove
that
he
had
merited
well
of
his
country
it
was
happy
i
thought
that
he
had
been
paid
in
honour
for
the
stipend
he
received
was
little
more
than
twelve
pounds
a
year
i
do
not
trouble
myself
or
you
with
the
calculation
of
swedish
ducats
thus
my
friend
you
perceive
the
necessity
of
perquisites
this
same
narrow
policy
runs
through
everything
i
shall
have
occasion
further
to
animadvert
on
it
though
my
host
amused
me
with
an
account
of
himself
which
gave
me
aim
idea
of
the
manners
of
the
people
i
was
about
to
visit
i
was
eager
to
climb
the
rocks
to
view
the
country
and
see
whether
the
honest
tars
had
regained
their
ship
with
the
help
of
the
lieutenant
telescope
i
saw
the
vessel
under
way
with
a
fair
though
gentle
gale
the
sea
was
calm
playful
even
as
the
most
shallow
stream
and
on
the
vast
basin
i
did
not
see
a
dark
speck
to
indicate
the
boat
my
conductors
were
consequently
arrived
straying
further
my
eye
was
attracted
by
the
sight
of
some
heartsease
that
peeped
through
the
rocks
i
caught
at
it
as
a
good
omen
and
going
to
preserve
it
in
a
letter
that
had
not
conveyed
balm
to
my
heart
a
cruel
remembrance
suffused
my
eyes
but
it
passed
away
like
an
april
shower
if
you
are
deep
read
in
shakespeare
you
will
recollect
that
this
was
the
little
western
flower
tinged
by
love
dart
which
maidens
call
love
in
idleness
the
gaiety
of
my
babe
was
unmixed
regardless
of
omens
or
sentiments
she
found
a
few
wild
strawberries
more
grateful
than
flowers
or
fancies
the
lieutenant
informed
me
that
this
was
a
commodious
bay
of
that
i
could
not
judge
though
i
felt
its
picturesque
beauty
rocks
were
piled
on
rocks
forming
a
suitable
bulwark
to
the
ocean
come
no
further
they
emphatically
said
turning
their
dark
sides
to
the
waves
to
augment
the
idle
roar
the
view
was
sterile
still
little
patches
of
earth
of
the
most
exquisite
verdure
enamelled
with
the
sweetest
wild
flowers
seemed
to
promise
the
goats
and
a
few
straggling
cows
luxurious
herbage
how
silent
and
peaceful
was
the
scene
i
gazed
around
with
rapture
and
felt
more
of
that
spontaneous
pleasure
which
gives
credibility
to
our
expectation
of
happiness
than
i
had
for
a
long
long
time
before
i
forgot
the
horrors
i
had
witnessed
in
france
which
had
cast
a
gloom
over
all
nature
and
suffering
the
enthusiasm
of
my
character
too
often
gracious
god
damped
by
the
tears
of
disappointed
affection
to
be
lighted
up
afresh
care
took
wing
while
simple
expanded
my
heart
to
prolong
this
enjoyment
i
readily
assented
to
the
proposal
of
our
host
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
family
the
master
of
which
spoke
english
who
was
the
drollest
dog
in
the
country
he
added
repeating
some
of
his
stories
with
a
hearty
laugh
i
walked
on
still
delighted
with
the
rude
beauties
of
the
scene
for
the
sublime
often
gave
place
imperceptibly
to
the
beautiful
dilating
the
emotions
which
were
painfully
concentrated
when
we
entered
this
abode
the
largest
i
had
yet
seen
i
was
introduced
to
a
numerous
family
but
the
father
from
whom
i
was
led
to
expect
so
much
entertainment
was
absent
the
lieutenant
consequently
was
obliged
to
be
the
interpreter
of
our
reciprocal
compliments
the
phrases
were
awkwardly
transmitted
it
is
true
but
looks
and
gestures
were
sufficient
to
make
them
intelligible
and
interesting
the
girls
were
all
vivacity
and
respect
for
me
could
scarcely
keep
them
from
romping
with
my
host
who
asking
for
a
pinch
of
snuff
was
presented
with
a
box
out
of
which
an
artificial
mouse
fastened
to
the
bottom
sprang
though
this
trick
had
doubtless
been
played
the
out
of
mind
yet
the
laughter
it
excited
was
not
less
genuine
they
were
overflowing
with
civility
but
to
prevent
their
almost
killing
my
babe
with
kindness
i
was
obliged
to
shorten
my
visit
and
two
or
three
of
the
girls
accompanied
us
bringing
with
them
a
part
of
whatever
the
house
afforded
to
contribute
towards
rendering
my
supper
more
plentiful
and
plentiful
in
fact
it
was
though
i
with
difficulty
did
honour
to
some
of
the
dishes
not
relishing
the
quantity
of
sugar
and
spices
put
into
everything
at
supper
my
host
told
me
bluntly
that
i
was
a
woman
of
observation
for
i
asked
him
the
arrangements
for
my
journey
were
quickly
made
i
could
only
have
a
car
with
as
i
did
not
choose
to
wait
till
a
carriage
could
be
sent
for
to
gothenburg
the
expense
of
my
journey
about
one
or
two
and
twenty
english
miles
i
found
would
not
amount
to
more
than
eleven
or
twelve
shillings
paying
he
assured
me
generously
i
gave
him
a
guinea
and
a
half
but
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
could
make
him
take
so
much
indeed
anything
for
my
lodging
and
fare
he
declared
that
it
was
next
to
robbing
me
explaining
how
much
i
ought
to
pay
on
the
road
however
as
i
was
positive
he
took
the
guinea
for
himself
but
as
a
condition
insisted
on
accompanying
me
to
prevent
my
meeting
with
any
trouble
or
imposition
on
the
way
i
then
retired
to
my
apartment
with
regret
the
night
was
so
fine
that
i
would
gladly
have
rambled
about
much
longer
yet
recollecting
that
i
must
rise
very
early
i
reluctantly
went
to
bed
but
my
senses
had
been
so
awake
and
my
imagination
still
continued
so
busy
that
i
sought
for
rest
in
vain
rising
before
six
i
scented
the
sweet
morning
air
i
had
long
before
heard
the
birds
twittering
to
hail
the
dawning
day
though
it
could
scarcely
have
been
allowed
to
have
departed
nothing
in
fact
can
equal
the
beauty
of
the
northern
summer
evening
and
night
if
night
it
may
be
called
that
only
wants
the
glare
of
day
the
full
light
which
frequently
seems
so
impertinent
for
i
could
write
at
midnight
very
well
without
a
candle
i
contemplated
all
nature
at
rest
the
rocks
even
grown
darker
in
their
appearance
looked
as
if
they
partook
of
the
general
repose
and
reclined
more
heavily
on
their
foundation
what
i
exclaimed
is
this
active
principle
which
keeps
me
still
awake
why
fly
my
thoughts
abroad
when
everything
around
me
appears
at
home
my
child
was
sleeping
with
equal
calmness
innocent
and
sweet
as
the
closing
flowers
some
recollections
attached
to
the
idea
of
home
mingled
with
reflections
respecting
the
state
of
society
i
had
been
contemplating
that
evening
made
a
tear
drop
on
the
rosy
cheek
i
had
just
kissed
and
emotions
that
trembled
on
the
brink
of
ecstasy
and
agony
gave
a
poignancy
to
my
sensations
which
made
me
feel
more
alive
than
usual
what
are
these
imperious
sympathies
how
frequently
has
melancholy
and
even
misanthropy
taken
possession
of
me
when
the
world
has
disgusted
me
and
friends
have
proved
unkind
i
have
then
considered
myself
as
a
particle
broken
off
from
the
grand
mass
of
mankind
i
was
alone
till
some
involuntary
sympathetic
emotion
like
the
attraction
of
adhesion
made
me
feel
that
i
was
still
a
part
of
a
mighty
whole
from
which
i
could
not
sever
myself
not
perhaps
for
the
reflection
has
been
carried
very
far
by
snapping
the
thread
of
an
existence
which
loses
its
charms
in
proportion
as
the
cruel
experience
of
life
stops
or
poisons
the
current
of
the
heart
futurity
what
hast
thou
not
to
give
to
those
who
know
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
happiness
i
speak
not
of
philosophical
contentment
though
pain
has
afforded
them
the
strongest
conviction
of
it
after
our
coffee
and
milk
for
the
mistress
of
the
house
had
been
roused
long
before
us
by
her
hospitality
my
baggage
was
taken
forward
in
a
boat
by
my
host
because
the
car
could
not
safely
have
been
brought
to
the
house
the
road
at
first
was
very
rocky
and
troublesome
but
our
driver
was
careful
and
the
horses
accustomed
to
the
frequent
and
sudden
acclivities
and
descents
so
that
not
apprehending
any
danger
i
played
with
my
girl
whom
i
would
not
leave
to
marguerite
care
on
account
of
her
timidity
stopping
at
a
little
inn
to
bait
the
horses
i
saw
the
first
countenance
in
sweden
that
displeased
me
though
the
man
was
better
dressed
than
any
one
who
had
as
yet
fallen
in
my
way
an
altercation
took
place
between
him
and
my
host
the
purport
of
which
i
could
not
guess
excepting
that
i
was
the
occasion
of
it
be
it
what
it
would
the
sequel
was
his
leaving
the
house
angrily
and
i
was
immediately
informed
that
he
was
the
house
officer
the
professional
had
indeed
effaced
the
national
character
for
living
as
he
did
within
these
frank
hospitable
people
still
only
the
exciseman
appeared
the
counterpart
of
some
i
had
met
with
in
england
and
france
i
was
unprovided
with
a
passport
not
having
entered
any
great
town
at
gothenburg
i
knew
i
could
immediately
obtain
one
and
only
the
trouble
made
me
object
to
the
searching
my
trunks
he
blustered
for
money
but
the
lieutenant
was
determined
to
guard
me
according
to
promise
from
imposition
to
avoid
being
interrogated
at
the
and
obliged
to
go
in
the
rain
to
give
an
account
of
myself
merely
a
form
before
we
could
get
the
refreshment
we
stood
in
need
of
he
requested
us
to
descend
i
might
have
said
step
from
our
car
and
walk
into
town
i
expected
to
have
found
a
tolerable
inn
but
was
ushered
into
a
most
comfortless
one
and
because
it
was
about
five
three
or
four
hours
after
their
dining
hour
i
could
not
prevail
on
them
to
give
me
anything
warm
to
eat
the
appearance
of
the
accommodations
obliged
me
to
deliver
one
of
my
recommendatory
letters
and
the
gentleman
to
whom
it
was
addressed
sent
to
look
out
for
a
lodging
for
me
whilst
i
partook
of
his
supper
as
nothing
passed
at
this
supper
to
characterise
the
country
i
shall
here
close
my
letter
yours
truly
letter
ii
gothenburg
is
a
clean
airy
town
and
having
been
built
by
the
dutch
has
canals
running
through
each
street
and
in
some
of
them
there
are
rows
of
trees
that
would
render
it
very
pleasant
were
it
not
for
the
pavement
which
is
intolerably
bad
there
are
several
rich
commercial
houses
scotch
french
and
swedish
but
the
scotch
i
believe
have
been
the
most
successful
the
commerce
and
commission
business
with
france
since
the
war
has
been
very
lucrative
and
enriched
the
merchants
i
am
afraid
at
the
expense
of
the
other
inhabitants
by
raising
the
price
of
the
necessaries
of
life
as
all
the
men
of
consequence
i
mean
men
of
the
largest
fortune
are
merchants
their
principal
enjoyment
is
a
relaxation
from
business
at
the
table
which
is
spread
at
i
think
too
early
an
hour
between
one
and
two
for
men
who
have
letters
to
write
and
accounts
to
settle
after
paying
due
respect
to
the
bottle
however
when
numerous
circles
are
to
be
brought
together
and
when
neither
literature
nor
public
amusements
furnish
topics
for
conversation
a
good
dinner
appears
to
be
the
only
centre
to
rally
round
especially
as
scandal
the
zest
of
more
select
parties
can
only
be
whispered
as
for
politics
i
have
seldom
found
it
a
subject
of
continual
discussion
in
a
country
town
in
any
part
of
the
world
the
politics
of
the
place
being
on
a
smaller
scale
suits
better
with
the
size
of
their
faculties
for
generally
speaking
the
sphere
of
observation
determines
the
extent
of
the
mind
the
more
i
see
of
the
world
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
civilisation
is
a
blessing
not
sufficiently
estimated
by
those
who
have
not
traced
its
progress
for
it
not
only
refines
our
enjoyments
but
produces
a
variety
which
enables
us
to
retain
the
primitive
delicacy
of
our
sensations
without
the
aid
of
the
imagination
all
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
must
sink
into
grossness
unless
continual
novelty
serve
as
a
substitute
for
the
imagination
which
being
impossible
it
was
to
this
weariness
i
suppose
that
solomon
alluded
when
he
declared
that
there
was
nothing
new
under
the
sun
nothing
for
the
common
sensations
excited
by
the
senses
yet
who
will
deny
that
the
imagination
and
understanding
have
made
many
very
many
discoveries
since
those
days
which
only
seem
harbingers
of
others
still
more
noble
and
beneficial
i
never
met
with
much
imagination
amongst
people
who
had
not
acquired
a
habit
of
reflection
and
in
that
state
of
society
in
which
the
judgment
and
taste
are
not
called
forth
and
formed
by
the
cultivation
of
the
arts
and
sciences
little
of
that
delicacy
of
feeling
and
thinking
is
to
be
found
characterised
by
the
word
sentiment
the
want
of
scientific
pursuits
perhaps
accounts
for
the
hospitality
as
well
as
for
the
cordial
reception
which
strangers
receive
from
the
inhabitants
of
small
towns
hospitality
has
i
think
been
too
much
praised
by
travellers
as
a
proof
of
goodness
of
heart
when
in
my
opinion
indiscriminate
hospitality
is
rather
a
criterion
by
which
you
may
form
a
tolerable
estimate
of
the
indolence
or
vacancy
of
a
head
or
in
other
words
a
fondness
for
social
pleasures
in
which
the
mind
not
having
its
proportion
of
exercise
the
bottle
must
be
pushed
about
these
remarks
are
equally
applicable
to
dublin
the
most
hospitable
city
i
ever
passed
through
but
i
will
try
to
confine
my
observations
more
particularly
to
sweden
it
is
true
i
have
only
had
a
glance
over
a
small
part
of
it
yet
of
its
present
state
of
manners
and
acquirements
i
think
i
have
formed
a
distinct
idea
without
having
visited
the
capital
where
in
fact
less
of
a
national
character
is
to
be
found
than
in
the
remote
parts
of
the
country
the
swedes
pique
themselves
on
their
politeness
but
far
from
being
the
polish
of
a
cultivated
mind
it
consists
merely
of
tiresome
forms
and
ceremonies
so
far
indeed
from
entering
immediately
into
your
character
and
making
you
feel
instantly
at
your
ease
like
the
french
their
civility
is
a
continual
restraint
on
all
your
actions
the
sort
of
superiority
which
a
fortune
gives
when
there
is
no
superiority
of
education
excepting
what
consists
in
the
observance
of
senseless
forms
has
a
contrary
effect
than
what
is
intended
so
that
i
could
not
help
reckoning
the
peasantry
the
politest
people
of
sweden
who
only
aiming
at
pleasing
you
never
think
of
being
admired
for
their
behaviour
their
tables
like
their
compliments
seem
equally
a
caricature
of
the
french
the
dishes
are
composed
as
well
as
theirs
of
a
variety
of
mixtures
to
destroy
the
native
taste
of
the
food
without
being
as
relishing
spices
and
sugar
are
put
into
everything
even
into
the
bread
and
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
their
partiality
to
dishes
is
the
constant
use
of
salted
provisions
necessity
obliges
them
to
lay
up
a
store
of
dried
fish
and
salted
meat
for
the
winter
and
in
summer
fresh
meat
and
fish
taste
insipid
after
them
to
which
may
be
added
the
constant
use
of
spirits
every
day
before
dinner
and
supper
even
whilst
the
dishes
are
cooling
on
the
table
men
and
women
repair
to
a
and
to
obtain
an
appetite
eat
butter
cheese
raw
salmon
or
anchovies
drinking
a
glass
of
brandy
salt
fish
or
meat
then
immediately
follows
to
give
a
further
whet
to
the
stomach
as
the
dinner
advances
pardon
me
for
taking
up
a
few
minutes
to
describe
what
alas
has
detained
me
two
or
three
hours
on
the
stretch
observing
dish
after
dish
is
changed
in
endless
rotation
and
handed
round
with
solemn
pace
to
each
guest
but
should
you
happen
not
to
like
the
first
dishes
which
was
often
my
case
it
is
a
gross
breach
of
politeness
to
ask
for
part
of
any
other
till
its
turn
comes
but
have
patience
and
there
will
be
eating
enough
allow
me
to
run
over
the
acts
of
a
visiting
day
not
overlooking
the
interludes
prelude
a
luncheon
then
a
succession
of
fish
flesh
and
fowl
for
two
hours
during
which
time
the
dessert
i
was
sorry
for
the
strawberries
and
cream
rests
on
the
table
to
be
impregnated
by
the
fumes
of
the
viands
coffee
immediately
follows
in
the
but
does
not
preclude
punch
ale
tea
and
cakes
raw
salmon
a
supper
brings
up
the
rear
not
forgetting
the
introductory
luncheon
almost
equalling
in
removes
the
dinner
a
day
of
this
kind
you
would
imagine
sufficient
but
a
and
a
a
feast
may
be
bearable
perhaps
when
stern
winter
frowns
shaking
with
chilling
aspect
his
hoary
locks
but
during
a
summer
sweet
as
fleeting
let
me
my
kind
strangers
escape
sometimes
into
your
fir
groves
wander
on
the
margin
of
your
beautiful
lakes
or
climb
your
rocks
to
view
still
others
in
endless
perspective
which
piled
by
more
than
giant
hand

the
heavens
to
intercept
its
rays

to
receive
the
parting
tinge
of
lingering
day

that
scarcely
softened
unto
twilight
allows
the
freshening
breeze
to
wake
and
the
moon
to
burst
forth

glory

the
recollection

lost
enjoyment

the
hapless
wight

futurity

letter
iii
the
population
of
sweden
has
been
estimated
from
two
millions
and
a
half
to
three
millions
a
small
number
for
such
an
immense
tract
of
country
of
which
only
so
much
is
cultivated
and
that
in
the
simplest
manner
as
is
absolutely
requisite
to
supply
the
necessaries
of
life
and
near
the
seashore
whence
herrings
are
easily
procured
there
scarcely
appears
a
vestige
of
cultivation
the
scattered
huts
that
stand
shivering
on
the
naked
rocks
braving
the
pitiless
elements
are
formed
of
logs
of
wood
rudely
hewn
and
so
little
pains
are
taken
with
the
craggy
foundation
that
nothing
hike
a
pathway
points
out
the
door
gathered
into
himself
by
the
cold
lowering
his
visage
to
avoid
the
cutting
blast
is
it
surprising
that
the
churlish
pleasure
of
drinking
drams
takes
place
of
social
enjoyments
amongst
the
poor
especially
if
we
take
into
the
account
that
they
mostly
live
on
provision
and
rye
bread
hard
enough
you
may
imagine
as
it
is
baked
only
once
a
year
the
servants
also
in
most
families
eat
this
kind
of
bread
and
have
a
different
kind
of
food
from
their
masters
which
in
spite
of
all
the
arguments
i
have
heard
to
vindicate
the
custom
appears
to
me
a
remnant
of
barbarism
in
fact
the
situation
of
the
servants
in
every
respect
particularly
that
of
the
women
shows
how
far
the
swedes
are
from
having
a
just
conception
of
rational
equality
they
are
not
termed
slaves
yet
a
man
may
strike
a
man
with
impunity
because
he
pays
him
wages
though
these
wages
are
so
low
that
necessity
must
teach
them
to
pilfer
whilst
servility
renders
them
false
and
boorish
still
the
men
stand
up
for
the
dignity
of
man
by
oppressing
the
women
the
most
menial
and
even
laborious
offices
are
therefore
left
to
these
poor
drudges
much
of
this
i
have
seen
in
the
winter
i
am
told
they
take
the
linen
down
to
the
river
to
wash
it
in
the
cold
water
and
though
their
hands
cut
by
the
ice
are
cracked
and
bleeding
the
men
their
will
not
disgrace
their
manhood
by
carrying
a
tub
to
lighten
their
burden
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
they
do
not
wear
shoes
or
stockings
when
i
inform
you
that
their
wages
are
seldom
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
shillings
per
annum
it
is
the
custom
i
know
to
give
them
a
new
year
gift
and
a
present
at
some
other
period
but
can
it
all
amount
to
a
just
indemnity
for
their
labour
the
treatment
of
servants
in
most
countries
i
grant
is
very
unjust
and
in
england
that
boasted
land
of
freedom
it
is
often
extremely
tyrannical
i
have
frequently
with
indignation
heard
gentlemen
declare
that
they
would
never
allow
a
servant
to
answer
them
and
ladies
of
the
most
exquisite
sensibility
who
were
continually
exclaiming
against
the
cruelty
of
the
vulgar
to
the
brute
creation
have
in
my
presence
forgot
that
their
attendants
had
human
feelings
as
well
as
forms
i
do
not
know
a
more
agreeable
sight
than
to
see
servants
part
of
a
family
by
taking
an
interest
generally
speaking
in
their
concerns
you
inspire
them
with
one
for
yours
we
must
love
our
servants
or
we
shall
never
be
sufficiently
attentive
to
their
happiness
and
how
can
those
masters
be
attentive
to
their
happiness
who
living
above
their
fortunes
are
more
anxious
to
outshine
their
neighbours
than
to
allow
their
household
the
innocent
enjoyments
they
earn
it
is
in
fact
much
more
difficult
for
servants
who
are
tantalised
by
seeing
and
preparing
the
dainties
of
which
they
are
not
to
partake
to
remain
honest
than
the
poor
whose
thoughts
are
not
led
from
their
homely
fare
so
that
though
the
servants
here
are
commonly
thieves
you
seldom
hear
of
housebreaking
or
robbery
on
the
highway
the
country
is
perhaps
too
thinly
inhabited
to
produce
many
of
that
description
of
thieves
termed
footpads
or
highwaymen
they
are
usually
the
spawn
of
great
cities
the
effect
of
the
spurious
desires
generated
by
wealth
rather
than
the
desperate
struggles
of
poverty
to
escape
from
misery
the
enjoyment
of
the
peasantry
was
drinking
brandy
and
coffee
before
the
latter
was
prohibited
and
the
former
not
allowed
to
be
privately
distilled
the
wars
carried
on
by
the
late
king
rendering
it
necessary
to
increase
the
revenue
and
retain
the
specie
in
the
country
by
every
possible
means
the
taxes
before
the
reign
of
charles
xii
were
inconsiderable
since
then
the
burden
has
continually
been
growing
heavier
and
the
price
of
provisions
has
proportionately
increased
nay
the
advantage
accruing
from
the
exportation
of
corn
to
france
and
rye
to
germany
will
probably
produce
a
scarcity
in
both
sweden
and
norway
should
not
a
peace
put
a
stop
to
it
this
autumn
for
speculations
of
various
kinds
have
already
almost
doubled
the
price
such
are
the
effects
of
war
that
it
saps
the
vitals
even
of
the
neutral
countries
who
obtaining
a
sudden
influx
of
wealth
appear
to
be
rendered
flourishing
by
the
destruction
which
ravages
the
hapless
nations
who
are
sacrificed
to
the
ambition
of
their
governors
i
shall
not
however
dwell
on
the
vices
though
they
be
of
the
most
contemptible
and
embruting
cast
to
which
a
sudden
accession
of
fortune
gives
birth
because
i
believe
it
may
be
delivered
as
an
axiom
that
it
is
only
in
proportion
to
the
industry
necessary
to
acquire
wealth
that
a
nation
is
really
benefited
by
it
the
prohibition
of
drinking
coffee
under
a
penalty
and
the
encouragement
given
to
public
distilleries
tend
to
impoverish
the
poor
who
are
not
affected
by
the
sumptuary
laws
for
the
regent
has
lately
laid
very
severe
restraints
on
the
articles
of
dress
which
the
middling
class
of
people
found
grievous
because
it
obliged
them
to
throw
aside
finery
that
might
have
lasted
them
for
their
lives
these
may
be
termed
vexatious
still
the
death
of
the
king
by
saving
them
from
the
consequences
his
ambition
would
naturally
have
entailed
on
them
may
be
reckoned
a
blessing
besides
the
french
revolution
has
not
only
rendered
all
the
crowned
heads
more
cautious
but
has
so
decreased
everywhere
excepting
amongst
themselves
a
respect
for
nobility
that
the
peasantry
have
not
only
lost
their
blind
reverence
for
their
seigniors
but
complain
in
a
manly
style
of
oppressions
which
before
they
did
not
think
of
denominating
such
because
they
were
taught
to
consider
themselves
as
a
different
order
of
beings
and
perhaps
the
efforts
which
the
aristocrats
are
making
here
as
well
as
in
every
other
part
of
europe
to
secure
their
sway
will
be
the
most
effectual
mode
of
undermining
it
taking
into
the
calculation
that
the
king
of
sweden
like
most
of
the
potentates
of
europe
has
continually
been
augmenting
his
power
by
encroaching
on
the
privileges
of
the
nobles
the
swedes
of
the
capital
are
formed
on
the
ancient
french
model
and
they
in
general
speak
that
language
for
they
have
a
knack
at
acquiring
languages
with
tolerable
fluency
this
may
be
reckoned
an
advantage
in
some
respects
but
it
prevents
the
cultivation
of
their
own
and
any
considerable
advance
in
literary
pursuits
a
sensible
writer
has
lately
observed
i
have
not
his
work
by
me
therefore
can
not
quote
his
exact
words
that
the
americans
very
wisely
let
the
europeans
make
their
books
and
fashions
for
them
but
i
can
not
coincide
with
him
in
this
opinion
the
reflection
necessary
to
produce
a
certain
number
even
of
tolerable
productions
augments
more
than
he
is
aware
of
the
mass
of
knowledge
in
the
community
desultory
reading
is
commonly
a
mere
pastime
but
we
must
have
an
object
to
refer
our
reflections
to
or
they
will
seldom
go
below
the
surface
as
in
travelling
the
keeping
of
a
journal
excites
to
many
useful
inquiries
that
would
not
have
been
thought
of
had
the
traveller
only
determined
to
see
all
he
could
see
without
ever
asking
himself
for
what
purpose
besides
the
very
dabbling
in
literature
furnishes
harmless
topics
of
conversation
for
the
not
having
such
subjects
at
hand
though
they
are
often
insupportably
fatiguing
renders
the
inhabitants
of
little
towns
prying
and
censorious
idleness
rather
than
gives
birth
to
scandal
and
to
the
observation
of
little
incidents
which
narrows
the
mind
it
is
frequently
only
the
fear
of
being
talked
of
which
produces
that
puerile
scrupulosity
about
trifles
incompatible
with
an
enlarged
plan
of
usefulness
and
with
the
basis
of
all
moral
principles
respect
for
the
virtues
which
are
not
merely
the
virtues
of
convention
i
am
my
friend
more
and
more
convinced
that
a
metropolis
or
an
abode
absolutely
solitary
is
the
best
calculated
for
the
improvement
of
the
heart
as
well
as
the
understanding
whether
we
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
man
nature
or
ourselves
mixing
with
mankind
we
are
obliged
to
examine
our
prejudices
and
often
imperceptibly
lose
as
we
analyse
them
and
in
the
country
growing
intimate
with
nature
a
thousand
little
circumstances
unseen
by
vulgar
eyes
give
birth
to
sentiments
dear
to
the
imagination
and
inquiries
which
expand
the
soul
particularly
when
cultivation
has
not
smoothed
into
insipidity
all
its
originality
of
character
i
love
the
country
yet
whenever
i
see
a
picturesque
situation
chosen
on
which
to
erect
a
dwelling
i
am
always
afraid
of
the
improvements
it
requires
uncommon
taste
to
form
a
whole
and
to
introduce
accommodations
and
ornaments
analogous
with
the
it
visited
near
gothenburg
a
house
with
improved
land
about
it
with
which
i
was
particularly
delighted
it
was
close
to
a
lake
embosomed
in
rocks
in
one
part
of
the
meadows
your
eye
was
directed
to
the
broad
expanse
in
another
you
were
led
into
a
shade
to
see
a
part
of
it
in
the
form
of
a
river
rush
amongst
the
fragments
of
rocks
and
roots
of
trees
nothing
seemed
forced
one
recess
particularly
grand
and
solemn
amongst
the
towering
cliffs
had
a
rude
stone
table
and
seat
placed
in
it
that
might
have
served
for
a
druid
haunt
whilst
a
placid
stream
below
enlivened
the
flowers
on
its
margin
where
elves
would
gladly
have
danced
their
airy
rounds
here
the
hand
of
taste
was
conspicuous
though
not
obtrusive
and
formed
a
contrast
with
another
abode
in
the
same
neighbourhood
on
which
much
money
had
been
lavished
where
italian
colonnades
were
placed
to
excite
the
wonder
of
the
rude
crags
and
a
stone
staircase
to
threaten
with
destruction
a
wooden
house
venuses
and
apollos
condemned
to
lie
hid
in
snow
three
parts
of
the
year
seemed
equally
displaced
and
called
the
attention
off
from
the
surrounding
sublimity
without
inspiring
any
voluptuous
sensations
yet
even
these
abortions
of
vanity
have
been
useful
numberless
workmen
have
been
employed
and
the
superintending
artist
has
improved
the
labourers
whose
unskilfulness
tormented
him
by
obliging
them
to
submit
to
the
discipline
of
rules
adieu
yours
affectionately
letter
iv
the
severity
of
the
long
swedish
winter
tends
to
render
the
people
sluggish
for
though
this
season
has
its
peculiar
pleasures
too
much
time
is
employed
to
guard
against
its
inclemency
still
as
warm
clothing
is
absolutely
necessary
the
women
spin
and
the
men
weave
and
by
these
exertions
get
a
fence
to
keep
out
the
cold
i
have
rarely
passed
a
knot
of
cottages
without
seeing
cloth
laid
out
to
bleach
and
when
i
entered
always
found
the
women
spinning
or
knitting
a
mistaken
tenderness
however
for
their
children
makes
them
even
in
summer
load
them
with
flannels
and
having
a
sort
of
natural
antipathy
to
cold
water
the
squalid
appearance
of
the
poor
babes
not
to
speak
of
the
noxious
smell
which
flannel
and
rugs
retain
seems
a
reply
to
a
question
i
had
often
asked
why
i
did
not
see
more
children
in
the
villages
i
passed
through
indeed
the
children
appear
to
be
nipt
in
the
bud
having
neither
the
graces
nor
charms
of
their
age
and
this
i
am
persuaded
is
much
more
owing
to
the
ignorance
of
the
mothers
than
to
the
rudeness
of
the
climate
rendered
feeble
by
the
continual
perspiration
they
are
kept
in
whilst
every
pore
is
absorbing
unwholesome
moisture
they
give
them
even
at
the
breast
brandy
salt
fish
and
every
other
crude
substance
which
air
and
exercise
enables
the
parent
to
digest
the
women
of
fortune
here
as
well
as
everywhere
else
have
nurses
to
suckle
their
children
and
the
total
want
of
chastity
in
the
lower
class
of
women
frequently
renders
them
very
unfit
for
the
trust
you
have
sometimes
remarked
to
me
the
difference
of
the
manners
of
the
country
girls
in
england
and
in
america
attributing
the
reserve
of
the
former
to
the
climate
to
the
absence
of
genial
suns
but
it
must
be
their
stars
not
the
zephyrs
gently
stealing
on
their
senses
which
here
lead
frail
women
astray
who
can
look
at
these
rocks
and
allow
the
voluptuousness
of
nature
to
be
an
excuse
for
gratifying
the
desires
it
inspires
we
must
therefore
find
some
other
cause
beside
voluptuousness
i
believe
to
account
for
the
conduct
of
the
swedish
and
american
country
girls
for
i
am
led
to
conclude
from
all
the
observations
i
have
made
that
there
is
always
a
mixture
of
sentiment
and
imagination
in
voluptuousness
to
which
neither
of
them
have
much
pretension
the
country
girls
of
ireland
and
wales
equally
feel
the
first
impulse
of
nature
which
restrained
in
england
by
fear
or
delicacy
proves
that
society
is
there
in
a
more
advanced
state
besides
as
the
mind
is
cultivated
and
taste
gains
ground
the
passions
become
stronger
and
rest
on
something
more
stable
than
the
casual
sympathies
of
the
moment
health
and
idleness
will
always
account
for
promiscuous
amours
and
in
some
degree
i
term
every
person
idle
the
exercise
of
whose
mind
does
not
bear
some
proportion
to
that
of
the
body
the
swedish
ladies
exercise
neither
sufficiently
of
course
grow
very
fat
at
an
early
age
and
when
they
have
not
this
downy
appearance
a
comfortable
idea
you
will
say
in
a
cold
climate
they
are
not
remarkable
for
fine
forms
they
have
however
mostly
fine
complexions
but
indolence
makes
the
lily
soon
displace
the
rose
the
quantity
of
coffee
spices
and
other
things
of
that
kind
with
want
of
care
almost
universally
spoil
their
teeth
which
contrast
but
ill
with
their
ruby
lips
the
manners
of
stockholm
are
refined
i
hear
by
the
introduction
of
gallantry
but
in
the
country
romping
and
coarse
freedoms
with
coarser
allusions
keep
the
spirits
awake
in
the
article
of
cleanliness
the
women
of
all
descriptions
seem
very
deficient
and
their
dress
shows
that
vanity
is
more
inherent
in
women
than
taste
the
men
appear
to
have
paid
still
less
court
to
the
graces
they
are
a
robust
healthy
race
distinguished
for
their
common
sense
and
turn
for
humour
rather
than
for
wit
or
sentiment
i
include
not
as
you
may
suppose
in
this
general
character
some
of
the
nobility
and
officers
who
having
travelled
are
polite
and
well
informed
i
must
own
to
you
that
the
lower
class
of
people
here
amuse
and
interest
me
much
more
than
the
middling
with
their
apish
good
breeding
and
prejudices
the
sympathy
and
frankness
of
heart
conspicuous
in
the
peasantry
produces
even
a
simple
gracefulness
of
deportment
which
has
frequently
struck
me
as
very
picturesque
i
have
often
also
been
touched
by
their
extreme
desire
to
oblige
me
when
i
could
not
explain
my
wants
and
by
their
earnest
manner
of
expressing
that
desire
there
is
such
a
charm
in
tenderness
it
is
so
delightful
to
love
our
and
meet
the
honest
affections
as
they
break
forth
still
my
good
friend
i
begin
to
think
that
i
should
not
like
to
live
continually
in
the
country
with
people
whose
minds
have
such
a
narrow
range
my
heart
would
frequently
be
interested
but
my
mind
would
languish
for
more
companionable
society
the
beauties
of
nature
appear
to
me
now
even
more
alluring
than
in
my
youth
because
my
intercourse
with
the
world
has
formed
without
vitiating
my
taste
but
with
respect
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
my
fancy
has
probably
when
disgusted
with
artificial
manners
solaced
itself
by
joining
the
advantages
of
cultivation
with
the
interesting
sincerity
of
innocence
forgetting
the
lassitude
that
ignorance
will
naturally
produce
i
like
to
see
animals
sporting
and
sympathise
in
their
pains
and
pleasures
still
i
love
sometimes
to
view
the
human
face
divine
and
trace
the
soul
as
well
as
the
heart
in
its
varying
lineaments
a
journey
to
the
country
which
i
must
shortly
make
will
enable
me
to
extend
my
adieu
letter
had
i
determined
to
travel
in
sweden
merely
for
pleasure
i
should
probably
have
chosen
the
road
to
stockholm
though
convinced
by
repeated
observation
that
the
manners
of
a
people
are
best
discriminated
in
the
country
the
inhabitants
of
the
capital
are
all
of
the
same
genus
for
the
varieties
in
the
species
we
must
therefore
search
where
the
habitations
of
men
are
so
separated
as
to
allow
the
difference
of
climate
to
have
its
natural
effect
and
with
this
difference
we
are
perhaps
most
forcibly
struck
at
the
first
view
just
as
we
form
an
estimate
of
the
leading
traits
of
a
character
at
the
first
glance
of
which
intimacy
afterwards
makes
us
almost
lose
sight
as
my
affairs
called
me
to
stromstad
the
frontier
town
of
sweden
in
my
way
to
norway
i
was
to
pass
over
i
heard
the
most
uncultivated
part
of
the
country
still
i
believe
that
the
grand
features
of
sweden
are
the
same
everywhere
and
it
is
only
the
grand
features
that
admit
of
description
there
is
an
individuality
in
every
prospect
which
remains
in
the
memory
as
forcibly
depicted
as
the
particular
features
that
have
arrested
our
attention
yet
we
can
not
find
words
to
discriminate
that
individuality
so
as
to
enable
a
stranger
to
say
this
is
the
face
that
the
view
we
may
amuse
by
setting
the
imagination
to
work
but
we
can
not
store
the
memory
with
a
fact
as
i
wish
to
give
you
a
general
idea
of
this
country
i
shall
continue
in
my
desultory
manner
to
make
such
observations
and
reflections
as
the
circumstances
draw
forth
without
losing
time
by
endeavouring
to
arrange
them
travelling
in
sweden
is
very
cheap
and
even
commodious
if
you
make
but
the
proper
arrangements
here
as
in
other
parts
of
the
continent
it
is
necessary
to
have
your
own
carriage
and
to
have
a
servant
who
can
speak
the
language
if
you
are
unacquainted
with
it
sometimes
a
servant
who
can
drive
would
be
found
very
useful
which
was
our
case
for
i
travelled
in
company
with
two
gentlemen
one
of
whom
had
a
german
servant
who
drove
very
well
this
was
all
the
party
for
not
intending
to
make
a
long
stay
i
left
my
little
girl
behind
me
as
the
roads
are
not
much
frequented
to
avoid
waiting
three
or
four
hours
for
horses
we
sent
as
is
the
constant
custom
an
the
night
before
to
order
them
at
every
post
and
we
constantly
found
them
ready
our
first
set
i
jokingly
termed
requisition
horses
but
afterwards
we
had
almost
always
little
spirited
animals
that
went
on
at
a
round
pace
the
roads
making
allowance
for
the
ups
and
downs
are
uncommonly
good
and
pleasant
the
expense
including
the
postillions
and
other
incidental
things
does
not
amount
to
more
than
a
shilling
the
swedish
mile
the
inns
are
tolerable
but
not
liking
the
rye
bread
i
found
it
necessary
to
furnish
myself
with
some
wheaten
before
i
set
out
the
beds
too
were
particularly
disagreeable
to
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
sinking
into
a
grave
when
i
entered
them
for
immersed
in
down
placed
in
a
sort
of
box
i
expected
to
be
suffocated
before
morning
the
sleeping
between
two
down
beds
they
do
so
even
in
summer
must
be
very
unwholesome
during
any
season
and
i
can
not
conceive
how
the
people
can
bear
it
especially
as
the
summers
are
very
warm
but
warmth
they
seem
not
to
feel
and
i
should
think
were
afraid
of
the
air
by
always
keeping
their
windows
shut
in
the
winter
i
am
persuaded
i
could
not
exist
in
rooms
thus
closed
up
with
stoves
heated
in
their
manner
for
they
only
put
wood
into
them
twice
a
day
and
when
the
stove
is
thoroughly
heated
they
shut
the
flue
not
admitting
any
air
to
renew
its
elasticity
even
when
the
rooms
are
crowded
with
company
these
stoves
are
made
of
earthenware
and
often
in
a
form
that
ornaments
an
apartment
which
is
never
the
case
with
the
heavy
iron
ones
i
have
seen
elsewhere
stoves
may
be
economical
but
i
like
a
fire
a
wood
one
in
preference
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
current
of
air
which
it
attracts
renders
this
the
best
mode
of
warming
rooms
we
arrived
early
the
second
evening
at
a
little
village
called
quistram
where
we
had
determined
to
pass
the
night
having
been
informed
that
we
should
not
afterwards
find
a
tolerable
inn
until
we
reached
stromstad
advancing
towards
quistram
as
the
sun
was
beginning
to
decline
i
was
particularly
impressed
by
the
beauty
of
the
situation
the
road
was
on
the
declivity
of
a
rocky
mountain
slightly
covered
with
a
mossy
herbage
and
vagrant
firs
at
the
bottom
a
river
straggling
amongst
the
recesses
of
stone
was
hastening
forward
to
the
ocean
and
its
grey
rocks
of
which
we
had
a
prospect
on
the
left
whilst
on
the
right
it
stole
peacefully
forward
into
the
meadows
losing
itself
in
a
rising
ground
as
we
drew
near
the
loveliest
banks
of
wild
flowers
variegated
the
prospect
and
promised
to
exhale
odours
to
add
to
the
sweetness
of
the
air
the
purity
of
which
you
could
almost
see
alas
not
smell
for
the
putrefying
herrings
which
they
use
as
manure
after
the
oil
has
been
extracted
spread
over
the
patches
of
earth
claimed
by
cultivation
destroyed
every
other
it
was
intolerable
and
entered
with
us
into
the
inn
which
was
in
other
respects
a
charming
retreat
whilst
supper
was
preparing
i
crossed
the
bridge
and
strolled
by
the
river
listening
to
its
murmurs
approaching
the
bank
the
beauty
of
which
had
attracted
my
attention
in
the
carriage
i
recognised
many
of
my
old
acquaintance
growing
with
great
luxuriance
seated
on
it
i
could
not
avoid
noting
an
obvious
remark
sweden
appeared
to
me
the
country
in
the
world
most
proper
to
form
the
botanist
and
natural
historian
every
object
seemed
to
remind
me
of
the
creation
of
things
of
the
first
efforts
of
sportive
nature
when
a
country
arrives
at
a
certain
state
of
perfection
it
looks
as
if
it
were
made
so
and
curiosity
is
not
excited
besides
in
social
life
too
many
objects
occur
for
any
to
be
distinctly
observed
by
the
generality
of
mankind
yet
a
contemplative
man
or
poet
in
the
country
i
do
not
mean
the
country
adjacent
to
cities
feels
and
sees
what
would
escape
vulgar
eyes
and
draws
suitable
inferences
this
train
of
reflections
might
have
led
me
further
in
every
sense
of
the
word
but
i
could
not
escape
from
the
detestable
evaporation
of
the
herrings
which
poisoned
all
my
pleasure
after
making
a
tolerable
supper
for
it
is
not
easy
to
get
fresh
provisions
on
the
road
i
retired
to
be
lulled
to
sleep
by
the
murmuring
of
a
stream
of
which
i
with
great
difficulty
obtained
sufficient
to
perform
my
daily
ablutions
the
last
battle
between
the
danes
and
swedes
which
gave
new
life
to
their
ancient
enmity
was
fought
at
this
place
only
seventeen
or
eighteen
were
killed
for
the
great
superiority
of
the
danes
and
norwegians
obliged
the
swedes
to
submit
but
sickness
and
a
scarcity
of
provision
proved
very
fatal
to
their
opponents
on
their
return
it
would
be
very
easy
to
search
for
the
particulars
of
this
engagement
in
the
publications
of
the
day
but
as
this
manner
of
filling
my
pages
does
not
come
within
my
plan
i
probably
should
not
have
remarked
that
the
battle
was
fought
here
were
it
not
to
relate
an
anecdote
which
i
had
from
good
authority
i
noticed
when
i
first
mentioned
this
place
to
you
that
we
descended
a
steep
before
we
came
to
the
inn
an
immense
ridge
of
rocks
stretching
out
on
one
side
the
inn
was
sheltered
under
them
and
about
a
hundred
yards
from
it
was
a
bridge
that
crossed
the
river
the
murmurs
of
which
i
have
celebrated
it
was
not
fordable
the
swedish
general
received
orders
to
stop
at
the
bridge
and
dispute
the
passage
a
most
advantageous
post
for
an
army
so
much
inferior
in
force
but
the
influence
of
beauty
is
not
confined
to
courts
the
mistress
of
the
inn
was
handsome
when
i
saw
her
there
were
still
some
remains
of
beauty
and
to
preserve
her
house
the
general
gave
up
the
only
tenable
station
he
was
afterwards
broke
for
contempt
of
orders
approaching
the
frontiers
consequently
the
sea
nature
resumed
an
aspect
ruder
and
ruder
or
rather
seemed
the
bones
of
the
world
waiting
to
be
clothed
with
everything
necessary
to
give
life
and
beauty
still
it
was
sublime
the
clouds
caught
their
hue
of
the
rocks
that
menaced
them
the
sun
appeared
afraid
to
shine
the
birds
ceased
to
sing
and
the
flowers
to
bloom
but
the
eagle
fixed
his
nest
high
amongst
the
rocks
and
the
vulture
hovered
over
this
abode
of
desolation
the
farm
houses
in
which
only
poverty
resided
were
formed
of
logs
scarcely
keeping
off
the
cold
and
drifting
snow
out
of
them
the
inhabitants
seldom
peeped
and
the
sports
or
prattling
of
children
was
neither
seen
or
heard
the
current
of
life
seemed
congealed
at
the
source
all
were
not
frozen
for
it
was
summer
you
remember
but
everything
appeared
so
dull
that
i
waited
to
see
ice
in
order
to
reconcile
me
to
the
absence
of
gaiety
the
day
before
my
attention
had
frequently
been
attracted
by
the
wild
beauties
of
the
country
we
passed
through
the
rocks
which
tossed
their
fantastic
heads
so
high
were
often
covered
with
pines
and
firs
varied
in
the
most
picturesque
manner
little
woods
filled
up
the
recesses
when
forests
did
not
darken
the
scene
and
valleys
and
glens
cleared
of
the
trees
displayed
a
dazzling
verdure
which
contrasted
with
the
gloom
of
the
shading
pines
the
eye
stole
into
many
a
covert
where
tranquillity
seemed
to
have
taken
up
her
abode
and
the
number
of
little
lakes
that
continually
presented
themselves
added
to
the
peaceful
composure
of
the
scenery
the
little
cultivation
which
appeared
did
not
break
the
enchantment
nor
did
castles
rear
their
turrets
aloft
to
crush
the
cottages
and
prove
that
man
is
more
savage
than
the
natives
of
the
woods
i
heard
of
the
bears
but
never
saw
them
stalk
forth
which
i
was
sorry
for
i
wished
to
have
seen
one
in
its
wild
state
in
the
winter
i
am
told
they
sometimes
catch
a
stray
cow
which
is
a
heavy
loss
to
the
owner
the
farms
are
small
indeed
most
of
the
houses
we
saw
on
the
road
indicated
poverty
or
rather
that
the
people
could
just
live
towards
the
frontiers
they
grew
worse
and
worse
in
their
appearance
as
if
not
willing
to
put
sterility
itself
out
of
countenance
no
gardens
smiled
round
the
habitations
not
a
potato
or
cabbage
to
eat
with
the
fish
drying
on
a
stick
near
the
door
a
little
grain
here
and
there
appeared
the
long
stalks
of
which
you
might
almost
reckon
the
day
was
gloomy
when
we
passed
over
this
rejected
spot
the
wind
bleak
and
winter
seemed
to
be
contending
with
nature
faintly
struggling
to
change
the
season
surely
thought
i
if
the
sun
ever
shines
here
it
can
not
warm
these
stones
moss
only
cleaves
to
them
partaking
of
their
hardness
and
nothing
like
vegetable
life
appears
to
cheer
with
hope
the
heart
so
far
from
thinking
that
the
primitive
inhabitants
of
the
world
lived
in
a
southern
climate
where
paradise
spontaneously
arose
i
am
led
to
infer
from
various
circumstances
that
the
first
dwelling
of
man
happened
to
be
a
spot
like
this
which
led
him
to
adore
a
sun
so
seldom
seen
for
this
worship
which
probably
preceded
that
of
demons
or
demigods
certainly
never
began
in
a
southern
climate
where
the
continual
presence
of
the
sun
prevented
its
being
considered
as
a
good
or
rather
the
want
of
it
never
being
felt
this
glorious
luminary
would
carelessly
have
diffused
its
blessings
without
being
hailed
as
a
benefactor
man
must
therefore
have
been
placed
in
the
north
to
tempt
him
to
run
after
the
sun
in
order
that
the
different
parts
of
the
earth
might
be
peopled
nor
do
i
wonder
that
hordes
of
barbarians
always
poured
out
of
these
regions
to
seek
for
milder
climes
when
nothing
like
cultivation
attached
them
to
the
soil
especially
when
we
take
into
the
view
that
the
adventuring
spirit
common
to
man
is
naturally
stronger
and
more
general
during
the
infancy
of
society
the
conduct
of
the
followers
of
mahomet
and
the
crusaders
will
sufficiently
corroborate
my
assertion
approaching
nearer
to
stromstad
the
appearance
of
the
town
proved
to
be
quite
in
character
with
the
country
we
had
just
passed
through
i
hesitated
to
use
the
word
country
yet
could
not
find
another
still
it
would
sound
absurd
to
talk
of
fields
of
rocks
the
town
was
built
on
and
under
them
three
or
four
trees
were
shrinking
from
the
wind
and
the
grass
grew
so
sparingly
that
i
could
not
avoid
thinking
johnson
hyperbolical
assertion
that
the
man
merited
well
of
his
country
who
made
a
few
blades
of
grass
grow
where
they
never
grew
before
might
here
have
been
uttered
with
strict
propriety
the
steeple
likewise
towered
aloft
for
what
is
a
church
even
amongst
the
lutherans
without
a
steeple
but
to
prevent
mischief
in
such
an
exposed
situation
it
is
wisely
placed
on
a
rock
at
some
distance
not
to
endanger
the
roof
of
the
church
rambling
about
i
saw
the
door
open
and
entered
when
to
my
great
surprise
i
found
the
clergyman
reading
prayers
with
only
the
clerk
attending
i
instantly
thought
of
swift
dearly
beloved
roger
but
on
inquiry
i
learnt
that
some
one
had
died
that
morning
and
in
sweden
it
is
customary
to
pray
for
the
dead
the
sun
who
i
suspected
never
dared
to
shine
began
now
to
convince
me
that
he
came
forth
only
to
torment
for
though
the
wind
was
still
cutting
the
rocks
became
intolerably
warm
under
my
feet
whilst
the
herring
effluvia
which
i
before
found
so
very
offensive
once
more
assailed
me
i
hastened
back
to
the
house
of
a
merchant
the
little
sovereign
of
the
place
because
he
was
by
far
the
richest
though
not
the
mayor
here
we
were
most
hospitably
received
and
introduced
to
a
very
fine
and
numerous
family
i
have
before
mentioned
to
you
the
lilies
of
the
north
i
might
have
added
water
lilies
for
the
complexion
of
many
even
of
the
young
women
seem
to
be
bleached
on
the
bosom
of
snow
but
in
this
youthful
circle
the
roses
bloomed
with
all
their
wonted
freshness
and
i
wondered
from
whence
the
fire
was
stolen
which
sparkled
in
their
fine
blue
eyes
here
we
slept
and
i
rose
early
in
the
morning
to
prepare
for
my
little
voyage
to
norway
i
had
determined
to
go
by
water
and
was
to
leave
my
companions
behind
but
not
getting
a
boat
immediately
and
the
wind
being
high
and
unfavourable
i
was
told
that
it
was
not
safe
to
go
to
sea
during
such
boisterous
weather
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
wait
for
the
morrow
and
had
the
present
day
on
my
hands
which
i
feared
would
be
irksome
because
the
family
who
possessed
about
a
dozen
french
words
amongst
them
and
not
an
english
phrase
were
anxious
to
amuse
me
and
would
not
let
me
remain
alone
in
my
room
the
town
we
had
already
walked
round
and
round
and
if
we
advanced
farther
on
the
coast
it
was
still
to
view
the
same
unvaried
immensity
of
water
surrounded
by
barrenness
the
gentlemen
wishing
to
peep
into
norway
proposed
going
to
fredericshall
the
first
town
the
distance
was
only
three
swedish
miles
there
and
back
again
was
but
a
day
journey
and
would
not
i
thought
interfere
with
my
voyage
i
agreed
and
invited
the
eldest
and
prettiest
of
the
girls
to
accompany
us
i
invited
her
because
i
like
to
see
a
beautiful
face
animated
by
pleasure
and
to
have
an
opportunity
of
regarding
the
country
whilst
the
gentlemen
were
amusing
themselves
with
her
i
did
not
know
for
i
had
not
thought
of
it
that
we
were
to
scale
some
of
the
most
mountainous
cliffs
of
sweden
in
our
way
to
the
ferry
which
separates
the
two
countries
entering
amongst
the
cliffs
we
were
sheltered
from
the
wind
warm
sunbeams
began
to
play
streams
to
flow
and
groves
of
pines
diversified
the
rocks
sometimes
they
became
suddenly
bare
and
sublime
once
in
particular
after
mounting
the
most
terrific
precipice
we
had
to
pass
through
a
tremendous
defile
where
the
closing
chasm
seemed
to
threaten
us
with
instant
destruction
when
turning
quickly
verdant
meadows
and
a
beautiful
lake
relieved
and
charmed
my
eyes
i
had
never
travelled
through
switzerland
but
one
of
my
companions
assured
me
that
i
should
not
there
find
anything
superior
if
equal
to
the
wild
grandeur
of
these
views
as
we
had
not
taken
this
excursion
into
our
plan
the
horses
had
not
been
previously
ordered
which
obliged
us
to
wait
two
hours
at
the
first
post
the
day
was
wearing
away
the
road
was
so
bad
that
walking
up
the
precipices
consumed
the
time
insensibly
but
as
we
desired
horses
at
each
post
ready
at
a
certain
hour
we
reckoned
on
returning
more
speedily
we
stopped
to
dine
at
a
tolerable
farm
they
brought
us
out
ham
butter
cheese
and
milk
and
the
charge
was
so
moderate
that
i
scattered
a
little
money
amongst
the
children
who
were
peeping
at
us
in
order
to
pay
them
for
their
trouble
arrived
at
the
ferry
we
were
still
detained
for
the
people
who
attend
at
the
ferries
have
a
stupid
kind
of
sluggishness
in
their
manner
which
is
very
provoking
when
you
are
in
haste
at
present
i
did
not
feel
it
for
scrambling
up
the
cliffs
my
eye
followed
the
river
as
it
rolled
between
the
grand
rocky
banks
and
to
complete
the
scenery
they
were
covered
with
firs
and
pines
through
which
the
wind
rustled
as
if
it
were
lulling
itself
to
sleep
with
the
declining
sun
behold
us
now
in
norway
and
i
could
not
avoid
feeling
surprise
at
observing
the
difference
in
the
manners
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
sides
of
the
river
for
everything
shows
that
the
norwegians
are
more
industrious
and
more
opulent
the
swedes
for
neighbours
are
seldom
the
best
friends
accuse
the
norwegians
of
knavery
and
they
retaliate
by
bringing
a
charge
of
hypocrisy
against
the
swedes
local
circumstances
probably
render
both
unjust
speaking
from
their
feelings
rather
than
reason
and
is
this
astonishing
when
we
consider
that
most
writers
of
travels
have
done
the
same
whose
works
have
served
as
materials
for
the
compilers
of
universal
histories
all
are
eager
to
give
a
national
character
which
is
rarely
just
because
they
do
not
discriminate
the
natural
from
the
acquired
difference
the
natural
i
believe
on
due
consideration
will
be
found
to
consist
merely
in
the
degree
of
vivacity
or
thoughtfulness
pleasures
or
pain
inspired
by
the
climate
whilst
the
varieties
which
the
forms
of
government
including
religion
produce
are
much
more
numerous
and
unstable
a
people
have
been
characterised
as
stupid
by
nature
what
a
paradox
because
they
did
not
consider
that
slaves
having
no
object
to
stimulate
industry
have
not
their
faculties
sharpened
by
the
only
thing
that
can
exercise
them
others
have
been
brought
forward
as
brutes
having
no
aptitude
for
the
arts
and
sciences
only
because
the
progress
of
improvement
had
not
reached
that
stage
which
produces
them
those
writers
who
have
considered
the
history
of
man
or
of
the
human
mind
on
a
more
enlarged
scale
have
fallen
into
similar
errors
not
reflecting
that
the
passions
are
weak
where
the
necessaries
of
life
are
too
hardly
or
too
easily
obtained
travellers
who
require
that
every
nation
should
resemble
their
native
country
had
better
stay
at
home
it
is
for
example
absurd
to
blame
a
people
for
not
having
that
degree
of
personal
cleanliness
and
elegance
of
manners
which
only
refinement
of
taste
produces
and
will
produce
everywhere
in
proportion
as
society
attains
a
general
polish
the
most
essential
service
i
presume
that
authors
could
render
to
society
would
be
to
promote
inquiry
and
discussion
instead
of
making
those
dogmatical
assertions
which
only
appear
calculated
to
gird
the
human
mind
round
with
imaginary
circles
like
the
paper
globe
which
represents
the
one
he
inhabits
this
spirit
of
inquiry
is
the
characteristic
of
the
present
century
from
which
the
succeeding
will
i
am
persuaded
receive
a
great
accumulation
of
knowledge
and
doubtless
its
diffusion
will
in
a
great
measure
destroy
the
factitious
national
characters
which
have
been
supposed
permanent
though
only
rendered
so
by
the
permanency
of
ignorance
arriving
at
fredericshall
at
the
siege
of
which
charles
xii
lost
his
life
we
had
only
time
to
take
a
transient
view
of
it
whilst
they
were
preparing
us
some
refreshment
poor
charles
i
thought
of
him
with
respect
i
have
always
felt
the
same
for
alexander
with
whom
he
has
been
classed
as
a
madman
by
several
writers
who
have
reasoned
superficially
confounding
the
morals
of
the
day
with
the
few
grand
principles
on
which
unchangeable
morality
rests
making
no
allowance
for
the
ignorance
and
prejudices
of
the
period
they
do
not
perceive
how
much
they
themselves
are
indebted
to
general
improvement
for
the
acquirements
and
even
the
virtues
which
they
would
not
have
had
the
force
of
mind
to
attain
by
their
individual
exertions
in
a
less
advanced
state
of
society
the
evening
was
fine
as
is
usual
at
this
season
and
the
refreshing
odour
of
the
pine
woods
became
more
perceptible
for
it
was
nine
when
we
left
fredericshall
at
the
ferry
we
were
detained
by
a
dispute
relative
to
our
swedish
passport
which
we
did
not
think
of
getting
countersigned
in
norway
midnight
was
coming
on
yet
it
might
with
such
propriety
have
been
termed
the
noon
of
night
that
had
young
ever
travelled
towards
the
north
i
should
not
have
wondered
at
his
becoming
enamoured
of
the
moon
but
it
is
not
the
queen
of
night
alone
who
reigns
here
in
all
her
splendour
though
the
sun
loitering
just
below
the
horizon
decks
her
within
a
golden
tinge
from
his
car
illuminating
the
cliffs
that
hide
him
the
heavens
also
of
a
clear
softened
blue
throw
her
forward
and
the
evening
star
appears
a
smaller
moon
to
the
naked
eye
the
huge
shadows
of
the
rocks
fringed
with
firs
concentrating
the
views
without
darkening
them
excited
that
tender
melancholy
which
sublimating
the
imagination
exalts
rather
than
depresses
the
mind
my
companions
fell
asleep
fortunately
they
did
not
snore
and
i
contemplated
fearless
of
idle
questions
a
night
such
as
i
had
never
before
seen
or
felt
to
charm
the
senses
and
calm
the
heart
the
very
air
was
balmy
as
it
freshened
into
morn
producing
the
most
voluptuous
sensations
a
vague
pleasurable
sentiment
absorbed
me
as
i
opened
my
bosom
to
the
embraces
of
nature
and
my
soul
rose
to
its
author
with
the
chirping
of
the
solitary
birds
which
began
to
feel
rather
than
see
advancing
day
i
had
leisure
to
mark
its
progress
the
grey
morn
streaked
with
silvery
rays
ushered
in
the
orient
beams
how
beautifully
varying
into
purple
yet
i
was
sorry
to
lose
the
soft
watery
clouds
which
preceded
them
exciting
a
kind
of
expectation
that
made
me
almost
afraid
to
breathe
lest
i
should
break
the
charm
i
saw
the
sun
and
sighed
one
of
my
companions
now
awake
perceiving
that
the
postillion
had
mistaken
the
road
began
to
swear
at
him
and
roused
the
other
two
who
reluctantly
shook
off
sleep
we
had
immediately
to
measure
back
our
steps
and
did
not
reach
stromstad
before
five
in
the
morning
the
wind
had
changed
in
the
night
and
my
boat
was
ready
a
dish
of
coffee
and
fresh
linen
recruited
my
spirits
and
i
directly
set
out
again
for
norway
purposing
to
land
much
higher
up
the
coast
wrapping
my
round
me
i
lay
down
on
some
sails
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
its
motion
rocking
me
to
rest
till
a
discourteous
wave
interrupted
my
slumbers
and
obliged
me
to
rise
and
feel
a
solitariness
which
was
not
so
soothing
as
that
of
the
past
night
adieu
letter
vi
the
sea
was
boisterous
but
as
i
had
an
experienced
pilot
i
did
not
apprehend
any
danger
sometimes
i
was
told
boats
are
driven
far
out
and
lost
however
i
seldom
calculate
chances
so
nicely
sufficient
for
the
day
is
the
obvious
evil
we
had
to
steer
amongst
islands
and
huge
rocks
rarely
losing
sight
of
the
shore
though
it
now
and
then
appeared
only
a
mist
that
bordered
the
water
edge
the
pilot
assured
me
that
the
numerous
harbours
on
the
norway
coast
were
very
safe
and
the
were
always
on
the
watch
the
swedish
side
is
very
dangerous
i
am
also
informed
and
the
help
of
experience
is
not
often
at
hand
to
enable
strange
vessels
to
steer
clear
of
the
rocks
which
lurk
below
the
water
close
to
the
shore
there
are
no
tides
here
nor
in
the
cattegate
and
what
appeared
to
me
a
consequence
no
sandy
beach
perhaps
this
observation
has
been
made
before
but
it
did
not
occur
to
me
till
i
saw
the
waves
continually
beating
against
the
bare
rocks
without
ever
receding
to
leave
a
sediment
to
harden
the
wind
was
fair
till
we
had
to
tack
about
in
order
to
enter
laurvig
where
we
arrived
towards
three
in
the
afternoon
it
is
a
clean
pleasant
town
with
a
considerable
which
gives
life
to
it
as
the
norwegians
do
not
frequently
see
travellers
they
are
very
curious
to
know
their
business
and
who
they
are
so
curious
that
i
was
half
tempted
to
adopt
franklin
plan
when
travelling
in
america
where
they
are
equally
prying
which
was
to
write
on
a
paper
for
public
inspection
my
name
from
whence
i
came
where
i
was
going
and
what
was
my
business
but
if
i
were
importuned
by
their
curiosity
their
friendly
gestures
gratified
me
a
woman
coming
alone
interested
them
and
i
know
not
whether
my
weariness
gave
me
a
look
of
peculiar
delicacy
but
they
approached
to
assist
me
and
inquire
after
my
wants
as
if
they
were
afraid
to
hurt
and
wished
to
protect
me
the
sympathy
i
inspired
thus
dropping
down
from
the
clouds
in
a
strange
land
affected
me
more
than
it
would
have
done
had
not
my
spirits
been
harassed
by
various
causes
by
much
thinking
musing
almost
to
madness
and
even
by
a
sort
of
weak
melancholy
that
hung
about
my
heart
at
parting
with
my
daughter
for
the
first
time
you
know
that
as
a
female
i
am
particularly
attached
to
her
i
feel
more
than
a
mother
fondness
and
anxiety
when
i
reflect
on
the
dependent
and
oppressed
state
of
her
sex
i
dread
lest
she
should
be
forced
to
sacrifice
her
heart
to
her
principles
or
principles
to
her
heart
with
trembling
hand
i
shall
cultivate
sensibility
and
cherish
delicacy
of
sentiment
lest
whilst
i
lend
fresh
blushes
to
the
rose
i
sharpen
the
thorns
that
will
wound
the
breast
i
would
fain
guard
i
dread
to
unfold
her
mind
lest
it
should
render
her
unfit
for
the
world
she
is
to
inhabit
hapless
woman
what
a
fate
is
thine
but
whither
am
i
wandering
i
only
meant
to
tell
you
that
the
impression
the
kindness
of
the
simple
people
made
visible
on
my
countenance
increased
my
sensibility
to
a
painful
degree
i
wished
to
have
had
a
room
to
myself
for
their
attention
and
rather
distressing
observation
embarrassed
me
extremely
yet
as
they
would
bring
me
eggs
and
make
my
coffee
i
found
i
could
not
leave
them
without
hurting
their
feelings
of
hospitality
it
is
customary
here
for
the
host
and
hostess
to
welcome
their
guests
as
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
my
clothes
in
their
turn
attracted
the
attention
of
the
females
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
foolish
vanity
which
makes
many
women
so
proud
of
the
observation
of
strangers
as
to
take
wonder
very
gratuitously
for
admiration
this
error
they
are
very
apt
to
fall
into
when
arrived
in
a
foreign
country
the
populace
stare
at
them
as
they
pass
yet
the
make
of
a
cap
or
the
singularity
of
a
gown
is
often
the
cause
of
the
flattering
attention
which
afterwards
supports
a
fantastic
superstructure
of
not
having
brought
a
carriage
over
with
me
expecting
to
have
met
a
person
where
i
landed
who
was
immediately
to
have
procured
me
one
i
was
detained
whilst
the
good
people
of
the
inn
sent
round
to
all
their
acquaintance
to
search
for
a
vehicle
a
rude
sort
of
cabriole
was
at
last
found
and
a
driver
half
drunk
who
was
not
less
eager
to
make
a
good
bargain
on
that
account
i
had
a
danish
captain
of
a
ship
and
his
mate
with
me
the
former
was
to
ride
on
horseback
at
which
he
was
not
very
expert
and
the
latter
to
partake
of
my
seat
the
driver
mounted
behind
to
guide
the
horses
and
flourish
the
whip
over
our
shoulders
he
would
not
suffer
the
reins
out
of
his
own
hands
there
was
something
so
grotesque
in
our
appearance
that
i
could
not
avoid
shrinking
into
myself
when
i
saw
a
man
in
the
group
which
crowded
round
the
door
to
observe
us
i
could
have
broken
the
driver
whip
for
cracking
to
call
the
women
and
children
together
but
seeing
a
significant
smile
on
the
face
i
had
before
remarked
i
burst
into
a
laugh
to
allow
him
to
do
so
too
and
away
we
flew
this
is
not
a
flourish
of
the
pen
for
we
actually
went
on
full
gallop
a
long
time
the
horses
being
very
good
indeed
i
have
never
met
with
better
if
so
good
as
in
norway
they
are
of
a
stouter
make
than
the
english
horses
appear
to
be
well
fed
and
are
not
easily
tired
i
had
to
pass
over
i
was
informed
the
most
fertile
and
best
cultivated
tract
of
country
in
norway
the
distance
was
three
norwegian
miles
which
are
longer
than
the
swedish
the
roads
were
very
good
the
farmers
are
obliged
to
repair
them
and
we
scampered
through
a
great
extent
of
country
in
a
more
improved
state
than
any
i
had
viewed
since
i
left
england
still
there
was
sufficient
of
hills
dales
and
rocks
to
prevent
the
idea
of
a
plain
from
entering
the
head
or
even
of
such
scenery
as
england
and
france
afford
the
prospects
were
also
embellished
by
water
rivers
and
lakes
before
the
sea
proudly
claimed
my
regard
and
the
road
running
frequently
through
lofty
groves
rendered
the
landscapes
beautiful
though
they
were
not
so
romantic
as
those
i
had
lately
seen
with
such
delight
it
was
late
when
i
reached
tonsberg
and
i
was
glad
to
go
to
bed
at
a
decent
inn
the
next
morning
the
of
july
conversing
with
the
gentleman
with
whom
i
had
business
to
transact
i
found
that
i
should
be
detained
at
tonsberg
three
weeks
and
i
lamented
that
i
had
not
brought
my
child
with
me
the
inn
was
quiet
and
my
room
so
pleasant
commanding
a
view
of
the
sea
confined
by
an
amphitheatre
of
hanging
woods
that
i
wished
to
remain
there
though
no
one
in
the
house
could
speak
english
or
french
the
mayor
my
friend
however
sent
a
young
woman
to
me
who
spoke
a
little
english
and
she
agreed
to
call
on
me
twice
a
day
to
receive
my
orders
and
translate
them
to
my
hostess
my
not
understanding
the
language
was
an
excellent
pretext
for
dining
alone
which
i
prevailed
on
them
to
let
me
do
at
a
late
hour
for
the
early
dinners
in
sweden
had
entirely
deranged
my
day
i
could
not
alter
it
there
without
disturbing
the
economy
of
a
family
where
i
was
as
a
visitor
necessity
having
forced
me
to
accept
of
an
invitation
from
a
private
family
the
lodgings
were
so
incommodious
amongst
the
norwegians
i
had
the
arrangement
of
my
own
time
and
i
determined
to
regulate
it
in
such
a
manner
that
i
might
enjoy
as
much
of
their
sweet
summer
as
i
possibly
could
short
it
is
true
but
passing
sweet
i
never
endured
a
winter
in
this
rude
clime
consequently
it
was
not
the
contrast
but
the
real
beauty
of
the
season
which
made
the
present
summer
appear
to
me
the
finest
i
had
ever
seen
sheltered
from
the
north
and
eastern
winds
nothing
can
exceed
the
salubrity
the
soft
freshness
of
the
western
gales
in
the
evening
they
also
die
away
the
aspen
leaves
tremble
into
stillness
and
reposing
nature
seems
to
be
warmed
by
the
moon
which
here
assumes
a
genial
aspect
and
if
a
light
shower
has
chanced
to
fall
with
the
sun
the
juniper
the
underwood
of
the
forest
exhales
a
wild
perfume
mixed
with
a
thousand
nameless
sweets
that
soothing
the
heart
leave
images
in
the
memory
which
the
imagination
will
ever
hold
dear
nature
is
the
nurse
of
sentiment
the
true
source
of
taste
yet
what
misery
as
well
as
rapture
is
produced
by
a
quick
perception
of
the
beautiful
and
sublime
when
it
is
exercised
in
observing
animated
nature
when
every
beauteous
feeling
and
emotion
excites
responsive
sympathy
and
the
harmonised
soul
sinks
into
melancholy
or
rises
to
ecstasy
just
as
the
chords
are
touched
like
the
aeolian
harp
agitated
by
the
changing
wind
but
how
dangerous
is
it
to
foster
these
sentiments
in
such
an
imperfect
state
of
existence
and
how
difficult
to
eradicate
them
when
an
affection
for
mankind
a
passion
for
an
individual
is
but
the
unfolding
of
that
love
which
embraces
all
that
is
great
and
beautiful
when
a
warm
heart
has
received
strong
impressions
they
are
not
to
be
effaced
emotions
become
sentiments
and
the
imagination
renders
even
transient
sensations
permanent
by
fondly
retracing
them
i
can
not
without
a
thrill
of
delight
recollect
views
i
have
seen
which
are
not
to
be
forgotten
nor
looks
i
have
felt
in
every
nerve
which
i
shall
never
more
meet
the
grave
has
closed
over
a
dear
friend
the
friend
of
my
youth
still
she
is
present
with
me
and
i
hear
her
soft
voice
warbling
as
i
stray
over
the
heath
fate
has
separated
me
from
another
the
fire
of
whose
eyes
tempered
by
infantine
tenderness
still
warms
my
breast
even
when
gazing
on
these
tremendous
cliffs
sublime
emotions
absorb
my
soul
and
smile
not
if
i
add
that
the
rosy
tint
of
morning
reminds
me
of
a
suffusion
which
will
never
more
charm
my
senses
unless
it
reappears
on
the
cheeks
of
my
child
her
sweet
blushes
i
may
yet
hide
in
my
bosom
and
she
is
still
too
young
to
ask
why
starts
the
tear
so
near
akin
to
pleasure
and
pain
i
can
not
write
any
more
at
present
we
will
talk
of
tonsberg
letter
vii
though
the
king
of
denmark
be
an
absolute
monarch
yet
the
norwegians
appear
to
enjoy
all
the
blessings
of
freedom
norway
may
be
termed
a
sister
kingdom
but
the
people
have
no
viceroy
to
lord
it
over
them
and
fatten
his
dependants
with
the
fruit
of
their
labour
there
are
only
two
counts
in
the
whole
country
who
have
estates
and
exact
some
feudal
observances
from
their
tenantry
all
the
rest
of
the
country
is
divided
into
small
farms
which
belong
to
the
cultivator
it
is
true
some
few
appertaining
to
the
church
are
let
but
always
on
a
lease
for
life
generally
renewed
in
favour
of
the
eldest
son
who
has
this
advantage
as
well
as
a
right
to
a
double
portion
of
the
property
but
the
value
of
the
farm
is
estimated
and
after
his
portion
is
assigned
to
him
he
must
be
answerable
for
the
residue
to
the
remaining
part
of
the
family
every
farmer
for
ten
years
is
obliged
to
attend
annually
about
twelve
days
to
learn
the
military
exercise
but
it
is
always
at
a
small
distance
from
his
dwelling
and
does
not
lead
him
into
any
new
habits
of
life
there
are
about
six
thousand
regulars
also
in
garrison
at
christiania
and
fredericshall
who
are
equally
reserved
with
the
militia
for
the
defence
of
their
own
country
so
that
when
the
prince
royal
passed
into
sweden
in
he
was
obliged
to
request
not
command
them
to
accompany
him
on
this
expedition
these
corps
are
mostly
composed
of
the
sons
of
the
cottagers
who
being
labourers
on
the
farms
are
allowed
a
few
acres
to
cultivate
for
themselves
these
men
voluntarily
enlist
but
it
is
only
for
a
limited
period
six
years
at
the
expiration
of
which
they
have
the
liberty
of
retiring
the
pay
is
only
twopence
a
day
and
bread
still
considering
the
cheapness
of
the
country
it
is
more
than
sixpence
in
england
the
distribution
of
landed
property
into
small
farms
produces
a
degree
of
equality
which
i
have
seldom
seen
elsewhere
and
the
rich
being
all
merchants
who
are
obliged
to
divide
their
personal
fortune
amongst
their
children
the
boys
always
receiving
twice
as
much
as
the
girls
property
has
met
a
chance
of
accumulating
till
overgrowing
wealth
destroys
the
balance
of
liberty
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
me
talk
of
liberty
yet
the
norwegians
appear
to
me
to
be
the
most
free
community
i
have
ever
observed
the
mayor
of
each
town
or
district
and
the
judges
in
the
country
exercise
an
authority
almost
patriarchal
they
can
do
much
good
but
little
harm
as
every
individual
can
appeal
from
their
judgment
and
as
they
may
always
be
forced
to
give
a
reason
for
their
conduct
it
is
generally
regulated
by
prudence
they
have
not
time
to
learn
to
be
tyrants
said
a
gentleman
to
me
with
whom
i
discussed
the
subject
the
farmers
not
fearing
to
be
turned
out
of
their
farms
should
they
displease
a
man
in
power
and
having
no
vote
to
be
commanded
at
an
election
for
a
mock
representative
are
a
manly
race
for
not
being
obliged
to
submit
to
any
debasing
tenure
in
order
to
live
or
advance
themselves
in
the
world
they
act
with
an
independent
spirit
i
never
yet
have
heard
of
anything
like
domineering
or
oppression
excepting
such
as
has
arisen
from
natural
causes
the
freedom
the
people
enjoy
may
perhaps
render
them
a
little
litigious
and
subject
them
to
the
impositions
of
cunning
practitioners
of
the
law
but
the
authority
of
office
is
bounded
and
the
emoluments
of
it
do
not
destroy
its
utility
last
year
a
man
who
had
abused
his
power
was
cashiered
on
the
representation
of
the
people
to
the
bailiff
of
the
district
there
are
four
in
norway
who
might
with
propriety
be
termed
sheriffs
and
from
their
sentence
an
appeal
by
either
party
may
be
made
to
copenhagen
near
most
of
the
towns
are
commons
on
which
the
cows
of
all
the
inhabitants
indiscriminately
are
allowed
to
graze
the
poor
to
whom
a
cow
is
necessary
are
almost
supported
by
it
besides
to
render
living
more
easy
they
all
go
out
to
fish
in
their
own
boats
and
fish
is
their
principal
food
the
lower
class
of
people
in
the
towns
are
in
general
sailors
and
the
industrious
have
usually
little
ventures
of
their
own
that
serve
to
render
the
winter
comfortable
with
respect
to
the
country
at
large
the
importation
is
considerably
in
favour
of
norway
they
are
forbidden
at
present
to
export
corn
or
rye
on
account
of
the
advanced
price
the
restriction
which
most
resembles
the
painful
subordination
of
ireland
is
that
vessels
trading
to
the
west
indies
are
obliged
to
pass
by
their
own
ports
and
unload
their
cargoes
at
copenhagen
which
they
afterwards
reship
the
duty
is
indeed
inconsiderable
but
the
navigation
being
dangerous
they
run
a
double
risk
there
is
an
excise
on
all
articles
of
consumption
brought
to
the
towns
but
the
officers
are
not
strict
and
it
would
be
reckoned
invidious
to
enter
a
house
to
search
as
in
england
the
norwegians
appear
to
me
a
sensible
shrewd
people
with
little
scientific
knowledge
and
still
less
taste
for
literature
but
they
are
arriving
at
the
epoch
which
precedes
the
introduction
of
the
arts
and
sciences
most
of
the
towns
are
seaports
and
seaports
are
not
favourable
to
improvement
the
captains
acquire
a
little
superficial
knowledge
by
travelling
which
their
indefatigable
attention
to
the
making
of
money
prevents
their
digesting
and
the
fortune
that
they
thus
laboriously
acquire
is
spent
as
it
usually
is
in
towns
of
this
description
in
show
and
good
living
they
love
their
country
but
have
not
much
public
spirit
their
exertions
are
generally
speaking
only
for
their
families
which
i
conceive
will
always
be
the
case
till
politics
becoming
a
subject
of
discussion
enlarges
the
heart
by
opening
the
understanding
the
french
revolution
will
have
this
effect
they
sing
at
present
with
great
glee
many
republican
songs
and
seem
earnestly
to
wish
that
the
republic
may
stand
yet
they
appear
very
much
attached
to
their
prince
royal
and
as
far
as
rumour
can
give
an
idea
of
a
character
he
appears
to
merit
their
attachment
when
i
am
at
copenhagen
i
shall
be
able
to
ascertain
on
what
foundation
their
good
opinion
is
built
at
present
i
am
only
the
echo
of
it
in
the
year
he
travelled
through
norway
and
acts
of
mercy
gave
dignity
to
the
parade
and
interest
to
the
joy
his
presence
inspired
at
this
town
he
pardoned
a
girl
condemned
to
die
for
murdering
an
illegitimate
child
a
crime
seldom
committed
in
this
country
she
is
since
married
and
become
the
careful
mother
of
a
family
this
might
be
given
as
an
instance
that
a
desperate
act
is
not
always
a
proof
of
an
incorrigible
depravity
of
character
the
only
plausible
excuse
that
has
been
brought
forward
to
justify
the
infliction
of
capital
punishments
i
will
relate
two
or
three
other
anecdotes
to
you
for
the
truth
of
which
i
will
not
vouch
because
the
facts
were
not
of
sufficient
consequence
for
me
to
take
much
pains
to
ascertain
them
and
true
or
false
they
evince
that
the
people
like
to
make
a
kind
of
mistress
of
their
prince
an
officer
mortally
wounded
at
the
battle
of
quistram
desired
to
speak
with
the
prince
and
with
his
dying
breath
earnestly
recommended
to
his
care
a
young
woman
of
christiania
to
whom
he
was
engaged
when
the
prince
returned
there
a
ball
was
given
by
the
chief
inhabitants
he
inquired
whether
this
unfortunate
girl
was
invited
and
requested
that
she
might
though
of
the
second
class
the
girl
came
she
was
pretty
and
finding
herself
among
her
superiors
bashfully
sat
down
as
near
the
door
as
possible
nobody
taking
notice
of
her
shortly
after
the
prince
entering
immediately
inquired
for
her
and
asked
her
to
dance
to
the
mortification
of
the
rich
dames
after
it
was
over
he
handed
her
to
the
top
of
the
room
and
placing
himself
by
her
spoke
of
the
loss
she
had
sustained
with
tenderness
promising
to
provide
for
anyone
she
should
marry
as
the
story
goes
she
is
since
married
and
he
has
not
forgotten
his
promise
a
little
girl
during
the
same
expedition
in
sweden
who
informed
him
that
the
logs
of
a
bridge
were
out
underneath
was
taken
by
his
orders
to
christiania
and
put
to
school
at
his
expense
before
i
retail
other
beneficial
effects
of
his
journey
it
is
necessary
to
inform
you
that
the
laws
here
are
mild
and
do
not
punish
capitally
for
any
crime
but
murder
which
seldom
occurs
every
other
offence
merely
subjects
the
delinquent
to
imprisonment
and
labour
in
the
castle
or
rather
arsenal
at
christiania
and
the
fortress
at
fredericshall
the
first
and
second
conviction
produces
a
sentence
for
a
limited
number
of
years
two
three
five
or
seven
proportioned
to
the
atrocity
of
the
crime
after
the
third
he
is
whipped
branded
in
the
forehead
and
condemned
to
perpetual
slavery
this
is
the
ordinary
course
of
justice
for
some
flagrant
breaches
of
trust
or
acts
of
wanton
cruelty
criminals
have
been
condemned
to
slavery
for
life
time
first
the
of
conviction
but
not
frequently
the
number
of
these
slaves
do
not
i
am
informed
amount
to
more
than
a
hundred
which
is
not
considerable
compared
with
the
population
upwards
of
eight
hundred
thousand
should
i
pass
through
christiania
on
my
return
to
gothenburg
i
shall
probably
have
an
opportunity
of
learning
other
particulars
there
is
also
a
house
of
correction
at
christiania
for
trifling
misdemeanours
where
the
women
are
confined
to
labour
and
imprisonment
even
for
life
the
state
of
the
prisoners
was
represented
to
the
prince
in
consequence
of
which
he
visited
the
arsenal
and
house
of
correction
the
slaves
at
the
arsenal
were
loaded
with
irons
of
a
great
weight
he
ordered
them
to
be
lightened
as
much
as
possible
the
people
in
the
house
of
correction
were
commanded
not
to
speak
to
him
but
four
women
condemned
to
remain
there
for
life
got
into
the
passage
and
fell
at
his
feet
he
granted
them
a
pardon
and
inquiring
respecting
the
treatment
of
the
prisoners
he
was
informed
that
they
were
frequently
whipped
going
in
and
coming
out
and
for
any
fault
at
the
discretion
of
the
inspectors
this
custom
he
humanely
abolished
though
some
of
the
principal
inhabitants
whose
situation
in
life
had
raised
them
above
the
temptation
of
stealing
were
of
opinion
that
these
chastisements
were
necessary
and
wholesome
in
short
everything
seems
to
announce
that
the
prince
really
cherishes
the
laudable
ambition
of
fulfilling
the
duties
of
his
station
this
ambition
is
cherished
and
directed
by
the
count
bernstorff
the
prime
minister
of
denmark
who
is
universally
celebrated
for
his
abilities
and
virtue
the
happiness
of
the
people
is
a
substantial
eulogium
and
from
all
i
can
gather
the
inhabitants
of
denmark
and
norway
are
the
least
oppressed
people
of
europe
the
press
is
free
they
translate
any
of
the
french
publications
of
the
day
deliver
their
opinion
on
the
subject
and
discuss
those
it
leads
to
with
great
freedom
and
without
fearing
to
displease
the
government
on
the
subject
of
religion
they
are
likewise
becoming
tolerant
at
least
and
perhaps
have
advanced
a
step
further
in
one
writer
has
ventured
to
deny
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
and
to
question
the
necessity
or
utility
of
the
christian
system
without
being
considered
universally
as
a
monster
which
would
have
been
the
case
a
few
years
ago
they
have
translated
many
german
works
on
education
and
though
they
have
not
adopted
any
of
their
plans
it
has
become
a
subject
of
discussion
there
are
some
grammar
and
free
schools
but
from
what
i
hear
not
very
good
ones
all
the
children
learn
to
read
write
and
cast
accounts
for
the
purposes
of
common
life
they
have
no
university
and
nothing
that
deserves
the
name
of
science
is
taught
nor
do
individuals
by
pursuing
any
branch
of
knowledge
excite
a
degree
of
curiosity
which
is
the
forerunner
of
improvement
knowledge
is
not
absolutely
necessary
to
enable
a
considerable
portion
of
the
community
to
live
and
till
it
is
i
fear
it
never
becomes
general
in
this
country
where
minerals
abound
there
is
not
one
collection
and
in
all
probability
i
venture
a
conjecture
the
want
of
mechanical
and
chemical
knowledge
renders
the
silver
mines
unproductive
for
the
quantity
of
silver
obtained
every
year
is
not
sufficient
to
defray
the
expenses
it
has
been
urged
that
the
employment
of
such
a
number
of
hands
is
very
beneficial
but
a
positive
loss
is
never
to
be
done
away
and
the
men
thus
employed
would
naturally
find
some
other
means
of
living
instead
of
being
thus
a
dead
weight
on
government
or
rather
on
the
community
from
whom
its
revenue
is
drawn
about
three
english
miles
from
tonsberg
there
is
a
salt
work
belonging
like
all
their
establishments
to
government
in
which
they
employ
above
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
and
maintain
nearly
five
hundred
people
who
earn
their
living
the
clear
profit
an
increasing
one
amounts
to
two
thousand
pounds
sterling
and
as
the
eldest
son
of
the
inspector
an
ingenious
young
man
has
been
sent
by
the
government
to
travel
and
acquire
some
mathematical
and
chemical
knowledge
in
germany
it
has
a
chance
of
being
improved
he
is
the
only
person
i
have
met
with
here
who
appears
to
have
a
scientific
turn
of
mind
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
i
have
not
met
with
others
who
have
a
spirit
of
inquiry
the
at
ubes
are
basins
in
the
sand
and
the
sun
produces
the
evaporation
but
here
there
is
no
beach
besides
the
heat
of
summer
is
so
that
it
would
be
idle
to
contrive
machines
for
such
an
inconsiderable
portion
of
the
year
they
therefore
always
use
fires
and
the
whole
establishment
appears
to
be
regulated
with
judgment
the
situation
is
well
chosen
and
beautiful
i
do
not
find
from
the
observation
of
a
person
who
has
resided
here
for
forty
years
that
the
sea
advances
or
recedes
on
this
coast
i
have
already
remarked
that
little
attention
is
paid
to
education
excepting
reading
writing
and
the
rudiments
of
arithmetic
i
ought
to
have
added
that
a
catechism
is
carefully
taught
and
the
children
obliged
to
read
in
the
churches
before
the
congregation
to
prove
that
they
are
not
neglected
degrees
to
enable
any
one
to
practise
any
profession
must
be
taken
at
copenhagen
and
the
people
of
this
country
having
the
good
sense
to
perceive
that
men
who
are
to
live
in
a
community
should
at
least
acquire
the
elements
of
their
knowledge
and
form
their
youthful
attachments
there
are
seriously
endeavouring
to
establish
a
university
in
norway
and
tonsberg
as
a
central
place
in
the
best
part
of
the
country
had
the
most
suffrages
for
experiencing
the
bad
effects
of
a
metropolis
they
have
determined
not
to
have
it
in
or
near
christiania
should
such
an
establishment
take
place
it
will
promote
inquiry
throughout
the
country
and
give
a
new
face
to
society
premiums
have
been
offered
and
prize
questions
written
which
i
am
told
have
merit
the
building
and
other
appendages
of
the
seat
of
science
might
enable
tonsberg
to
recover
its
pristine
consequence
for
it
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
towns
of
norway
and
once
contained
nine
churches
at
present
there
are
only
two
one
is
a
very
old
structure
and
has
a
gothic
respectability
about
it
which
scarcely
amounts
to
grandeur
because
to
render
a
gothic
pile
grand
it
must
have
a
huge
unwieldiness
of
appearance
the
chapel
of
windsor
may
be
an
exception
to
this
rule
i
mean
before
it
was
in
its
present
nice
clean
state
when
i
first
saw
it
the
pillars
within
had
acquired
by
time
a
sombre
hue
which
accorded
with
the
architecture
and
the
gloom
increased
its
dimensions
to
the
eye
by
hiding
its
parts
but
now
it
all
bursts
on
the
view
at
once
and
the
sublimity
has
vanished
before
the
brush
and
broom
for
it
has
been
and
scraped
till
it
has
become
as
bright
and
neat
as
the
pots
and
pans
in
a
notable
kitchen
yes
the
very
spurs
on
the
recumbent
knights
were
deprived
of
their
venerable
rust
to
give
a
striking
proof
that
a
love
of
order
in
trifles
and
taste
for
proportion
and
arrangement
are
very
distinct
the
glare
of
light
thus
introduced
entirely
destroys
the
sentiment
these
piles
are
calculated
to
inspire
so
that
when
i
heard
something
like
a
jig
from
the
i
thought
it
an
excellent
hall
for
dancing
or
feasting
the
measured
pace
of
thought
with
which
i
had
entered
the
cathedral
changed
into
a
trip
and
i
bounded
on
the
terrace
to
see
the
royal
family
with
a
number
of
ridiculous
images
in
my
head
that
i
shall
not
now
recall
the
norwegians
are
fond
of
music
and
every
little
church
has
an
organ
in
the
church
i
have
mentioned
there
is
an
inscription
importing
that
a
king
james
vi
of
scotland
and
of
england
who
came
with
more
than
princely
gallantry
to
escort
his
bride
home
stood
there
and
heard
divine
service
there
is
a
little
recess
full
of
coffins
which
contains
bodies
embalmed
long
since
so
long
that
there
is
not
even
a
tradition
to
lead
to
a
guess
at
their
names
a
desire
of
preserving
the
body
seems
to
have
prevailed
in
most
countries
of
the
world
futile
as
it
is
to
term
it
a
preservation
when
the
noblest
parts
are
immediately
sacrificed
merely
to
save
the
muscles
skin
and
bone
from
rottenness
when
i
was
shown
these
human
petrifactions
i
shrank
back
with
disgust
and
horror
ashes
to
ashes
thought
i
dust
to
dust
if
this
be
not
dissolution
it
is
something
worse
than
natural
decay
it
is
treason
against
humanity
thus
to
lift
up
the
awful
veil
which
would
fain
hide
its
weakness
the
grandeur
of
the
active
principle
is
never
more
strongly
felt
than
at
such
a
sight
for
nothing
is
so
ugly
as
the
human
form
when
deprived
of
life
and
thus
dried
into
stone
merely
to
preserve
the
most
disgusting
image
of
death
the
contemplation
of
noble
ruins
produces
a
melancholy
that
exalts
the
mind
we
take
a
retrospect
of
the
exertions
of
man
the
fate
of
empires
and
their
rulers
and
marking
the
grand
destruction
of
ages
it
seems
the
necessary
change
of
the
leading
to
improvement
our
very
soul
expands
and

i
would
not

embalmed
in
my

sacrilegiously

in

quietly

to
mow
them
down
with

struggle

some

that
it

a

more
than

tonsberg
was
formerly
the
residence
of
one
of
the
little
sovereigns
of
norway
and
on
an
adjacent
mountain
the
vestiges
of
a
fort
remain
which
was
battered
down
by
the
swedes
the
entrance
of
the
bay
lying
close
to
it
here
i
have
frequently
strayed
sovereign
of
the
waste
i
seldom
met
any
human
creature
and
sometimes
reclining
on
the
mossy
down
under
the
shelter
of
a
rock
the
prattling
of
the
sea
amongst
the
pebbles
has
lulled
me
to
sleep
no
fear
of
any
rude
satyr
approaching
to
interrupt
my
repose
balmy
were
the
slumbers
and
soft
the
gales
that
refreshed
me
when
i
awoke
to
follow
with
an
eye
vaguely
curious
the
white
sails
as
they
turned
the
cliffs
or
seemed
to
take
shelter
under
the
pines
which
covered
the
little
islands
that
so
gracefully
rose
to
render
the
terrific
ocean
beautiful
the
fishermen
were
calmly
casting
their
nets
whilst
the
hovered
over
the
unruffled
deep
everything
seemed
to
harmonise
into
tranquillity
even
the
mournful
call
of
the
bittern
was
in
cadence
with
the
tinkling
bells
on
the
necks
of
the
cows
that
pacing
slowly
one
after
the
other
along
an
inviting
path
in
the
vale
below
were
repairing
to
the
cottages
to
be
milked
with
what
ineffable
pleasure
have
i
not
gazed
and
gazed
again
losing
my
breath
through
my
eyes
my
very
soul
diffused
itself
in
the
scene
and
seeming
to
become
all
senses
glided
in
the
waves
melted
in
the
freshening
breeze
or
taking
its
flight
with
fairy
wing
to
the
misty
mountain
which
bounded
the
prospect
fancy
tripped
over
new
lawns
more
beautiful
even
than
the
lovely
slopes
on
the
winding
shore
before
me
i
pause
again
breathless
to
trace
with
renewed
delight
sentiments
which
entranced
me
when
turning
my
humid
eyes
from
the
expanse
below
to
the
vault
above
my
sight
pierced
the
fleecy
clouds
that
softened
the
azure
brightness
and
imperceptibly
recalling
the
reveries
of
childhood
i
bowed
before
the
awful
throne
of
my
creator
whilst
i
rested
on
its
footstool
you
have
sometimes
wondered
my
dear
friend
at
the
extreme
affection
of
my
nature
but
such
is
the
temperature
of
my
soul
it
is
not
the
vivacity
of
youth
the
heyday
of
existence
for
years
have
i
endeavoured
to
calm
an
impetuous
tide
labouring
to
make
my
feelings
take
an
orderly
course
it
was
striving
against
the
stream
i
must
love
and
admire
with
warmth
or
i
sink
into
sadness
tokens
of
love
which
i
have
received
have
wrapped
me
in
elysium
purifying
the
heart
they
enchanted
my
bosom
still
glows
do
not
saucily
ask
repeating
sterne
question
maria
is
it
still
so
warm
sufficiently
o
my
god
has
it
been
chilled
by
sorrow
and
unkindness
still
nature
will
prevail
and
if
i
blush
at
recollecting
past
enjoyment
it
is
the
rosy
hue
of
pleasure
heightened
by
modesty
for
the
blush
of
modesty
and
shame
are
as
distinct
as
the
emotions
by
which
they
are
produced
i
need
scarcely
inform
you
after
telling
you
of
my
walks
that
my
constitution
has
been
renovated
here
and
that
i
have
recovered
my
activity
even
whilst
attaining
a
little
my
imprudence
last
winter
and
some
untoward
accidents
just
at
the
time
i
was
weaning
my
child
had
reduced
me
to
a
state
of
weakness
which
i
never
before
experienced
a
slow
fever
preyed
on
me
every
night
during
my
residence
in
sweden
and
after
i
arrived
at
tonsberg
by
chance
i
found
a
fine
rivulet
filtered
through
the
rocks
and
confined
in
a
basin
for
the
cattle
it
tasted
to
me
like
a
chalybeate
at
any
rate
it
was
pure
and
the
good
effect
of
the
various
waters
which
invalids
are
sent
to
drink
depends
i
believe
more
on
the
air
exercise
and
change
of
scene
than
on
their
medicinal
qualities
i
therefore
determined
to
turn
my
morning
walks
towards
it
and
seek
for
health
from
the
nymph
of
the
fountain
partaking
of
the
beverage
offered
to
the
tenants
of
the
shade
chance
likewise
led
me
to
discover
a
new
pleasure
equally
beneficial
to
my
health
i
wished
to
avail
myself
of
my
vicinity
to
the
sea
and
bathe
but
it
was
not
possible
near
the
town
there
was
no
convenience
the
young
woman
whom
i
mentioned
to
you
proposed
rowing
me
across
the
water
amongst
the
rocks
but
as
she
was
pregnant
i
insisted
on
taking
one
of
the
oars
and
learning
to
row
it
was
not
difficult
and
i
do
not
know
a
pleasanter
exercise
i
soon
became
expert
and
my
train
of
thinking
kept
time
as
it
were
with
the
oars
or
i
suffered
the
boat
to
be
carried
along
by
the
current
indulging
a
pleasing
forgetfulness
or
fallacious
hopes
how
fallacious
yet
without
hope
what
is
to
sustain
life
but
the
fear
of
annihilation
the
only
thing
of
which
i
have
ever
felt
a
dread
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
being
no
more
of
losing
myself
though
existence
is
often
but
a
painful
consciousness
of
misery
nay
it
appears
to
me
impossible
that
i
should
cease
to
exist
or
that
this
active
restless
spirit
equally
alive
to
joy
and
sorrow
should
only
be
organised
dust
ready
to
fly
abroad
the
moment
the
spring
snaps
or
the
spark
goes
out
which
kept
it
together
surely
something
resides
in
this
heart
that
is
not
perishable
and
life
is
more
than
a
dream
sometimes
to
take
up
my
oar
once
more
when
the
sea
was
calm
i
was
amused
by
disturbing
the
innumerable
young
star
fish
which
floated
just
below
the
surface
i
had
never
observed
them
before
for
they
have
not
a
hard
shell
like
those
which
i
have
seen
on
the
seashore
they
look
like
thickened
water
with
a
white
edge
and
four
purple
circles
of
different
forms
were
in
the
middle
over
an
incredible
number
of
fibres
or
white
lines
touching
them
the
cloudy
substance
would
turn
or
close
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
very
gracefully
but
when
i
took
one
of
them
up
in
the
ladle
with
which
i
heaved
the
water
out
of
the
boat
it
appeared
only
a
colourless
jelly
i
did
not
see
any
of
the
seals
numbers
of
which
followed
our
boat
when
we
landed
in
sweden
but
though
i
like
to
sport
in
the
water
i
should
have
had
no
desire
to
join
in
their
gambols
enough
you
will
say
of
inanimate
nature
and
of
brutes
to
use
the
lordly
phrase
of
man
let
me
hear
something
of
the
inhabitants
the
gentleman
with
whom
i
had
business
is
the
mayor
of
tonsberg
he
speaks
english
intelligibly
and
having
a
sound
understanding
i
was
sorry
that
his
numerous
occupations
prevented
my
gaining
as
much
information
from
him
as
i
could
have
drawn
forth
had
we
frequently
conversed
the
people
of
the
town
as
far
as
i
had
an
opportunity
of
knowing
their
sentiments
are
extremely
well
satisfied
with
his
manner
of
discharging
his
office
he
has
a
degree
of
information
and
good
sense
which
excites
respect
whilst
a
cheerfulness
almost
amounting
to
gaiety
enables
him
to
reconcile
differences
and
keep
his
neighbours
in
good
humour
i
lost
my
horse
said
a
woman
to
me
but
ever
since
when
i
want
to
send
to
the
mill
or
go
out
the
mayor
lends
me
one
he
scolds
if
i
do
not
come
for
it
a
criminal
was
branded
during
my
stay
here
for
the
third
offence
but
the
relief
he
received
made
him
declare
that
the
judge
was
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
world
i
sent
this
wretch
a
trifle
at
different
times
to
take
with
him
into
slavery
as
it
was
more
than
he
expected
he
wished
very
much
to
see
me
and
this
wish
brought
to
my
remembrance
an
anecdote
i
heard
when
i
was
in
lisbon
a
wretch
who
had
been
imprisoned
several
years
during
which
period
lamps
had
been
put
up
was
at
last
condemned
to
a
cruel
death
yet
in
his
way
to
execution
he
only
wished
for
one
night
respite
to
see
the
city
lighted
having
dined
in
company
at
the
mayor
i
was
invited
with
his
family
to
spend
the
day
at
one
of
the
richest
merchant
houses
though
i
could
not
speak
danish
i
knew
that
i
could
see
a
great
deal
yes
i
am
persuaded
that
i
have
formed
a
very
just
opinion
of
the
character
of
the
norwegians
without
being
able
to
hold
converse
with
them
i
had
expected
to
meet
some
company
yet
was
a
little
disconcerted
at
being
ushered
into
an
apartment
full
of
well
dressed
people
and
glancing
my
eyes
round
they
rested
on
several
very
pretty
faces
rosy
cheeks
sparkling
eyes
and
light
brown
or
golden
locks
for
i
never
saw
so
much
hair
with
a
yellow
cast
and
with
their
fine
complexions
it
looked
very
becoming
these
women
seem
a
mixture
of
indolence
and
vivacity
they
scarcely
ever
walk
out
and
were
astonished
that
i
should
for
pleasure
yet
they
are
immoderately
fond
of
dancing
unaffected
in
their
manners
if
they
have
no
pretensions
to
elegance
simplicity
often
produces
a
gracefulness
of
deportment
when
they
are
animated
by
a
particular
desire
to
please
which
was
the
case
at
present
the
solitariness
of
my
situation
which
they
thought
terrible
interested
them
very
much
in
my
favour
they
gathered
round
me
sung
to
me
and
one
of
the
prettiest
to
whom
i
gave
my
hand
with
some
degree
of
cordiality
to
meet
the
glance
of
her
eyes
kissed
me
very
affectionately
at
dinner
which
was
conducted
with
great
hospitality
though
we
remained
at
table
too
long
they
sung
several
songs
and
amongst
the
rest
translations
of
some
patriotic
french
ones
as
the
evening
advanced
they
became
playful
and
we
kept
up
a
sort
of
conversation
of
gestures
as
their
minds
were
totally
uncultivated
i
did
not
lose
much
perhaps
gained
by
not
being
able
to
understand
them
for
fancy
probably
filled
up
more
to
their
advantage
the
void
in
the
picture
be
that
as
it
may
they
excited
my
sympathy
and
i
was
very
much
flattered
when
i
was
told
the
next
day
that
they
said
it
was
a
pleasure
to
look
at
me
i
appeared
so
the
men
were
generally
captains
of
ships
several
spoke
english
very
tolerably
but
they
were
merely
men
confined
to
a
very
narrow
circle
of
observation
i
found
it
difficult
to
obtain
from
them
any
information
respecting
their
own
country
when
the
fumes
of
tobacco
did
not
keep
me
at
a
distance
i
was
invited
to
partake
of
some
other
feasts
and
always
had
to
complain
of
the
quantity
of
provision
and
the
length
of
time
taken
to
consume
it
for
it
would
not
have
been
proper
to
have
said
devour
all
went
on
so
fair
and
softly
the
servants
wait
as
slowly
as
their
mistresses
carve
the
young
women
here
as
well
as
in
sweden
have
commonly
bad
teeth
which
i
attribute
to
the
same
causes
they
are
fond
of
finery
but
do
not
pay
the
necessary
attention
to
their
persons
to
render
beauty
less
transient
than
a
flower
and
that
interesting
expression
which
sentiment
and
accomplishments
give
seldom
supplies
its
place
the
servants
have
likewise
an
inferior
sort
of
food
here
but
their
masters
are
not
allowed
to
strike
them
with
impunity
i
might
have
added
mistresses
for
it
was
a
complaint
of
this
kind
brought
before
the
mayor
which
led
me
to
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
the
wages
are
low
which
is
particularly
unjust
because
the
price
of
clothes
is
much
higher
than
that
of
provision
a
young
woman
who
is
wet
nurse
to
the
mistress
of
the
inn
where
i
lodge
receives
only
twelve
dollars
a
year
and
pays
ten
for
the
nursing
of
her
own
child
the
father
had
run
away
to
get
clear
of
the
expense
there
was
something
in
this
most
painful
state
of
widowhood
which
excited
my
compassion
and
led
me
to
reflections
on
the
instability
of
the
most
flattering
plans
of
happiness
that
were
painful
in
the
extreme
till
i
was
ready
to
ask
whether
this
world
was
not
created
to
exhibit
every
possible
combination
of
wretchedness
i
asked
these
questions
of
a
heart
writhing
with
anguish
whilst
i
listened
to
a
melancholy
ditty
sung
by
this
poor
girl
it
was
too
early
for
thee
to
be
abandoned
thought
i
and
i
hastened
out
of
the
house
to
take
my
solitary
evening
walk
and
here
i
am
again
to
talk
of
anything
but
the
pangs
arising
from
the
discovery
of
estranged
affection
and
the
lonely
sadness
of
a
deserted
heart
the
father
and
mother
if
the
father
can
be
ascertained
are
obliged
to
maintain
an
illegitimate
child
at
their
joint
expense
but
should
the
father
disappear
go
up
the
country
or
to
sea
the
mother
must
maintain
it
herself
however
accidents
of
this
kind
do
not
prevent
their
marrying
and
then
it
is
not
unusual
to
take
the
child
or
children
home
and
they
are
brought
up
very
amicably
with
the
marriage
progeny
i
took
some
pains
to
learn
what
books
were
written
originally
in
their
language
but
for
any
certain
information
respecting
the
state
of
danish
literature
i
must
wait
till
i
arrive
at
copenhagen
the
sound
of
the
language
is
soft
a
great
proportion
of
the
words
ending
in
vowels
and
there
is
a
simplicity
in
the
turn
of
some
of
the
phrases
which
have
been
translated
to
me
that
pleased
and
interested
me
in
the
country
the
farmers
use
the
and
and
they
do
not
acquire
the
polite
plurals
of
the
towns
by
meeting
at
market
the
not
having
markets
established
in
the
large
towns
appears
to
me
a
great
inconvenience
when
the
farmers
have
anything
to
sell
they
bring
it
to
the
neighbouring
town
and
take
it
from
house
to
house
i
am
surprised
that
the
inhabitants
do
not
feel
how
very
incommodious
this
usage
is
to
both
parties
and
redress
it
they
indeed
perceive
it
for
when
i
have
introduced
the
subject
they
acknowledged
that
they
were
often
in
want
of
necessaries
there
being
no
butchers
and
they
were
often
obliged
to
buy
what
they
did
not
want
yet
it
was
the
custom
and
the
changing
of
customs
of
a
long
standing
requires
more
energy
than
they
yet
possess
i
received
a
similar
reply
when
i
attempted
to
persuade
the
women
that
they
injured
their
children
by
keeping
them
too
warm
the
only
way
of
parrying
off
my
reasoning
was
that
they
must
do
as
other
people
did
in
short
reason
on
any
subject
of
change
and
they
stop
you
by
saying
that
the
town
would
talk
a
person
of
sense
with
a
large
fortune
to
ensure
respect
might
be
very
useful
here
by
inducing
them
to
treat
their
children
and
manage
their
sick
properly
and
eat
food
dressed
in
a
simpler
manner
the
example
for
instance
of
a
count
lady
reflecting
on
these
prejudices
made
me
revert
to
the
wisdom
of
those
legislators
who
established
institutions
for
the
good
of
the
body
under
the
pretext
of
serving
heaven
for
the
salvation
of
the
soul
these
might
with
strict
propriety
be
termed
pious
frauds
and
i
admire
the
peruvian
pair
for
asserting
that
they
came
from
the
sun
when
their
conduct
proved
that
they
meant
to
enlighten
a
benighted
country
whose
obedience
or
even
attention
could
only
be
secured
by
awe
thus
much
for
conquering
the
of
reason
but
when
it
is
once
in
motion
fables
once
held
sacred
may
be
ridiculed
and
sacred
they
were
when
useful
to
mankind
prometheus
alone
stole
fire
to
animate
the
first
man
his
posterity
needs
not
supernatural
aid
to
preserve
the
species
though
love
is
generally
termed
a
flame
and
it
may
not
be
necessary
much
longer
to
suppose
men
inspired
by
heaven
to
inculcate
the
duties
which
demand
special
grace
when
reason
convinces
them
that
they
are
the
happiest
who
are
the
most
nobly
employed
in
a
few
days
i
am
to
set
out
for
the
western
part
of
norway
and
then
shall
return
by
land
to
gothenburg
i
can
not
think
of
leaving
this
place
without
regret
i
speak
of
the
place
before
the
inhabitants
though
there
is
a
tenderness
in
their
artless
kindness
which
attaches
me
to
them
but
it
is
an
attachment
that
inspires
a
regret
very
different
from
that
i
felt
at
leaving
hull
in
my
way
to
sweden
the
domestic
happiness
and
gaiety
of
the
amiable
family
where
i
and
my
frances
were
so
hospitably
received
would
have
been
sufficient
to
ensure
the
tenderest
remembrance
without
the
recollection
of
the
social
evening
to
stimulate
it
when
good
breeding
gave
dignity
to
sympathy
and
wit
zest
to
reason
adieu
i
am
just
informed
that
my
horse
has
been
waiting
this
quarter
of
an
hour
i
now
venture
to
ride
out
alone
the
steeple
serves
as
a
landmark
i
once
or
twice
lost
my
way
walking
alone
without
being
able
to
inquire
after
a
path
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
make
to
the
steeple
or
windmill
over
hedge
and
ditch
yours
truly
letter
ix
i
have
already
informed
you
that
there
are
only
two
noblemen
who
have
estates
of
any
magnitude
in
norway
one
of
these
has
a
house
near
tonsberg
at
which
he
has
not
resided
for
some
years
having
been
at
court
or
on
embassies
he
is
now
the
danish
ambassador
in
london
the
house
is
pleasantly
situated
and
the
grounds
about
it
fine
but
their
neglected
appearance
plainly
tells
that
there
is
nobody
at
home
a
stupid
kind
of
sadness
to
my
eye
always
reigns
in
a
huge
habitation
where
only
servants
live
to
put
cases
on
the
furniture
and
open
the
windows
i
enter
as
i
would
into
the
tomb
of
the
capulets
to
look
at
the
family
pictures
that
here
frown
in
armour
or
smile
in
ermine
the
mildew
respects
not
the
lordly
robe
and
the
worm
riots
unchecked
on
the
cheek
of
beauty
there
was
nothing
in
the
architecture
of
the
building
or
the
form
of
the
furniture
to
detain
me
from
the
avenue
where
the
aged
pines
stretched
along
majestically
time
had
given
a
greyish
cast
to
their
foliage
and
they
stood
like
sires
of
the
forest
sheltered
on
all
sides
by
a
rising
progeny
i
had
not
ever
seen
so
many
oaks
together
in
norway
as
in
these
woods
nor
such
large
aspens
as
here
were
agitated
by
the
breeze
rendering
the
wind
audible
nay
musical
for
melody
seemed
on
the
wing
around
me
how
different
was
the
fresh
odour
that
reanimated
me
in
the
avenue
from
the
damp
chillness
of
the
apartments
and
as
little
did
the
gloomy
thoughtfulness
excited
by
the
dusty
hangings
and
pictures
resemble
the
reveries
inspired
by
the
soothing
melancholy
of
their
shade
in
the
winter
these
august
pines
towering
above
the
snow
must
relieve
the
eye
beyond
measure
and
give
life
to
the
white
waste
the
continual
recurrence
of
pine
and
fir
groves
in
the
day
sometimes
wearies
the
sight
but
in
the
evening
nothing
can
be
more
picturesque
or
more
properly
speaking
better
calculated
to
produce
poetical
images
passing
through
them
i
have
been
struck
with
a
mystic
kind
of
reverence
and
i
did
as
it
were
homage
to
their
venerable
shadows
not
nymphs
but
philosophers
seemed
to
inhabit
them
ever
musing
i
could
scarcely
conceive
that
they
were
without
some
consciousness
of
existence
without
a
calm
enjoyment
of
the
pleasure
they
diffused
how
often
do
my
feelings
produce
ideas
that
remind
me
of
the
origin
of
many
poetical
fictions
in
solitude
the
imagination
bodies
forth
its
conceptions
unrestrained
and
stops
enraptured
to
adore
the
beings
of
its
own
creation
these
are
moments
of
bliss
and
the
memory
recalls
them
with
delight
but
i
have
almost
forgotten
the
matters
of
fact
i
meant
to
relate
respecting
the
counts
they
have
the
presentation
of
the
livings
on
their
estates
appoint
the
judges
and
different
civil
officers
the
crown
reserving
to
itself
the
privilege
of
sanctioning
them
but
though
they
appoint
they
can
not
dismiss
their
tenants
also
occupy
their
farms
for
life
and
are
obliged
to
obey
any
summons
to
work
on
the
part
he
reserves
for
himself
but
they
are
paid
for
their
labour
in
short
i
have
seldom
heard
of
any
noblemen
so
innoxious
observing
that
the
gardens
round
the
count
estate
were
better
cultivated
than
any
i
had
before
seen
i
was
led
to
reflect
on
the
advantages
which
naturally
accrue
from
the
feudal
tenures
the
tenants
of
the
count
are
obliged
to
work
at
a
stated
price
in
his
grounds
and
garden
and
the
instruction
which
they
imperceptibly
receive
from
the
head
gardener
tends
to
render
them
useful
and
makes
them
in
the
common
course
of
things
better
husbandmen
and
gardeners
on
their
own
little
farms
thus
the
great
who
alone
travel
in
this
period
of
society
for
the
observation
of
manners
and
customs
made
by
sailors
is
very
confined
bring
home
improvement
to
promote
their
own
comfort
which
is
gradually
spread
abroad
amongst
the
people
till
they
are
stimulated
to
think
for
themselves
the
bishops
have
not
large
revenues
and
the
priests
are
appointed
by
the
king
before
they
come
to
them
to
be
ordained
there
is
commonly
some
little
farm
annexed
to
the
parsonage
and
the
inhabitants
subscribe
voluntarily
three
times
a
year
in
addition
to
the
church
fees
for
the
support
of
the
clergyman
the
church
lands
were
seized
when
lutheranism
was
introduced
the
desire
of
obtaining
them
being
probably
the
real
stimulus
of
reformation
the
tithes
which
are
never
required
in
kind
are
divided
into
three
parts
one
to
the
king
another
to
the
incumbent
and
the
third
to
repair
the
dilapidations
of
the
parsonage
they
do
not
amount
to
much
and
the
stipend
allowed
to
the
different
civil
officers
is
also
too
small
scarcely
deserving
to
be
termed
an
independence
that
of
the
officers
is
not
sufficient
to
procure
the
necessaries
of
life
no
wonder
then
if
necessity
leads
them
to
knavery
much
public
virtue
can
not
be
expected
till
every
employment
putting
perquisites
out
of
the
question
has
a
salary
sufficient
to
reward
industry
whilst
none
are
so
great
as
to
permit
the
possessor
to
remain
idle
it
is
this
want
of
proportion
between
profit
and
labour
which
debases
men
producing
the
sycophantic
appellations
of
patron
and
client
and
that
pernicious
du
proverbially
vicious
the
farmers
are
hospitable
as
well
as
independent
offering
once
to
pay
for
some
coffee
i
drank
when
taking
shelter
from
the
rain
i
was
asked
rather
angrily
if
a
little
coffee
was
worth
paying
for
they
smoke
and
drink
drams
but
not
so
much
as
formerly
drunkenness
often
the
attendant
disgrace
of
hospitality
will
here
as
well
as
everywhere
else
give
place
to
gallantry
and
refinement
of
manners
but
the
change
will
not
be
suddenly
produced
the
people
of
every
class
are
constant
in
their
attendance
at
church
they
are
very
fond
of
dancing
and
the
sunday
evenings
in
norway
as
in
catholic
countries
are
spent
in
exercises
which
exhilarate
the
spirits
without
vitiating
the
heart
the
rest
of
labour
ought
to
be
gay
and
the
gladness
i
have
felt
in
france
on
a
sunday
or
decadi
which
i
caught
from
the
faces
around
me
was
a
sentiment
more
truly
religious
than
all
the
stupid
stillness
which
the
streets
of
london
ever
inspired
where
the
sabbath
is
so
decorously
observed
i
recollect
in
the
country
parts
of
england
the
churchwardens
used
to
go
out
during
the
service
to
see
if
they
could
catch
any
luckless
wight
playing
at
bowls
or
skittles
yet
what
could
be
more
harmless
it
would
even
i
think
be
a
great
advantage
to
the
english
if
feats
of
activity
i
do
not
include
boxing
matches
were
encouraged
on
a
sunday
as
it
might
stop
the
progress
of
methodism
and
of
that
fanatical
spirit
which
appears
to
be
gaining
ground
i
was
surprised
when
i
visited
yorkshire
on
my
way
to
sweden
to
find
that
sullen
narrowness
of
thinking
had
made
such
a
progress
since
i
was
an
inhabitant
of
the
country
i
could
hardly
have
supposed
that
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
could
have
produced
such
an
alteration
for
the
worse
in
the
morals
of
a
place
yes
i
say
morals
for
observance
of
forms
and
avoiding
of
practices
indifferent
in
themselves
often
supply
the
place
of
that
regular
attention
to
duties
which
are
so
natural
that
they
seldom
are
vauntingly
exercised
though
they
are
worth
all
the
precepts
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
besides
many
of
these
deluded
people
with
the
best
meaning
actually
lose
their
reason
and
become
miserable
the
dread
of
damnation
throwing
them
into
a
state
which
merits
the
term
and
still
more
in
running
after
their
preachers
expecting
to
promote
their
salvation
they
disregard
their
welfare
in
this
world
and
neglect
the
interest
and
comfort
of
their
families
so
that
in
proportion
as
they
attain
a
reputation
for
piety
they
become
idle
aristocracy
and
fanaticism
seem
equally
to
be
gaining
ground
in
england
particularly
in
the
place
i
have
mentioned
i
saw
very
little
of
either
in
norway
the
people
are
regular
in
their
attendance
on
public
worship
but
religion
does
not
interfere
with
their
employments
as
the
farmers
cut
away
the
wood
they
clear
the
ground
every
year
therefore
the
country
is
becoming
fitter
to
support
the
inhabitants
half
a
century
ago
the
dutch
i
am
told
only
paid
for
the
cutting
down
of
the
wood
and
the
farmers
were
glad
to
get
rid
of
it
without
giving
themselves
any
trouble
at
present
they
form
a
just
estimate
of
its
value
nay
i
was
surprised
to
find
even
firewood
so
dear
when
it
appears
to
be
in
such
plenty
the
destruction
or
gradual
reduction
of
their
forests
will
probably
ameliorate
the
climate
and
their
manners
will
naturally
improve
in
the
same
ratio
as
industry
requires
ingenuity
it
is
very
fortunate
that
men
are
a
long
time
but
just
above
the
brute
creation
or
the
greater
part
of
the
earth
would
never
have
been
rendered
habitable
because
it
is
the
patient
labour
of
men
who
are
only
seeking
for
a
subsistence
which
produces
whatever
embellishes
existence
affording
leisure
for
the
cultivation
of
the
arts
and
sciences
that
lift
man
so
far
above
his
first
state
i
never
my
friend
thought
so
deeply
of
the
advantages
obtained
by
human
industry
as
since
i
have
been
in
norway
the
world
requires
i
see
the
hand
of
man
to
perfect
it
and
as
this
task
naturally
unfolds
the
faculties
he
exercises
it
is
physically
impossible
that
he
should
have
remained
in
rousseau
golden
age
of
stupidity
and
considering
the
question
of
human
happiness
where
oh
where
does
it
reside
has
it
taken
up
its
abode
with
unconscious
ignorance
or
with
the
mind
is
it
the
offspring
of
thoughtless
animal
spirits
or
the
dye
of
fancy
continually
flitting
round
the
expected
pleasure
the
increasing
population
of
the
earth
must
necessarily
tend
to
its
improvement
as
the
means
of
existence
are
multiplied
by
invention
you
have
probably
made
similar
reflections
in
america
where
the
face
of
the
country
i
suppose
resembles
the
wilds
of
norway
i
am
delighted
with
the
romantic
views
i
daily
contemplate
animated
by
the
purest
air
and
i
am
interested
by
the
simplicity
of
manners
which
reigns
around
me
still
nothing
so
soon
wearies
out
the
feelings
as
unmarked
simplicity
i
am
therefore
half
convinced
that
i
could
not
live
very
comfortably
exiled
from
the
countries
where
mankind
are
so
much
further
advanced
in
knowledge
imperfect
as
it
is
and
unsatisfactory
to
the
thinking
mind
even
now
i
begin
to
long
to
hear
what
you
are
doing
in
england
and
france
my
thoughts
fly
from
this
wilderness
to
the
polished
circles
of
the
world
till
recollecting
its
vices
and
follies
i
bury
myself
in
the
woods
but
find
it
necessary
to
emerge
again
that
i
may
not
lose
sight
of
the
wisdom
and
virtue
which
exalts
my
nature
what
a
long
time
it
requires
to
know
ourselves
and
yet
almost
every
one
has
more
of
this
knowledge
than
he
is
willing
to
own
even
to
himself
i
can
not
immediately
determine
whether
i
ought
to
rejoice
at
having
turned
over
in
this
solitude
a
new
page
in
the
history
of
my
own
heart
though
i
may
venture
to
assure
you
that
a
further
acquaintance
with
mankind
only
tends
to
increase
my
respect
for
your
judgment
and
esteem
for
your
character
farewell
letter
i
have
once
more
my
friend
taken
flight
for
i
left
tonsberg
yesterday
but
with
an
intention
of
returning
in
my
way
back
to
sweden
the
road
to
laurvig
is
very
fine
and
the
country
the
best
cultivated
in
norway
i
never
before
admired
the
beech
tree
and
when
i
met
stragglers
here
they
pleased
me
still
less
long
and
lank
they
would
have
forced
me
to
allow
that
the
line
of
beauty
requires
some
curves
if
the
stately
pine
standing
near
erect
throwing
her
vast
arms
around
had
not
looked
beautiful
in
opposition
to
such
narrow
rules
in
these
respects
my
very
reason
obliges
me
to
permit
my
feelings
to
be
my
criterion
whatever
excites
emotion
has
charms
for
me
though
i
insist
that
the
cultivation
of
the
mind
by
warming
nay
almost
creating
the
imagination
produces
taste
and
an
immense
variety
of
sensations
and
emotions
partaking
of
the
exquisite
pleasure
inspired
by
beauty
and
sublimity
as
i
know
of
no
end
to
them
the
word
infinite
so
often
misapplied
might
on
this
occasion
be
introduced
with
something
like
propriety
but
i
have
rambled
away
again
i
intended
to
have
remarked
to
you
the
effect
produced
by
a
grove
of
towering
beech
the
airy
lightness
of
their
foliage
admitting
a
degree
of
sunshine
which
giving
a
transparency
to
the
leaves
exhibited
an
appearance
of
freshness
and
elegance
that
i
had
never
before
remarked
i
thought
of
descriptions
of
italian
scenery
but
these
evanescent
graces
seemed
the
effect
of
enchantment
and
i
imperceptibly
breathed
softly
lest
i
should
destroy
what
was
real
yet
looked
so
like
the
creation
of
fancy
dryden
fable
of
the
flower
and
the
leaf
was
not
a
more
poetical
reverie
adieu
however
to
fancy
and
to
all
the
sentiments
which
ennoble
our
nature
i
arrived
at
laurvig
and
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
lawyers
of
different
descriptions
my
head
turned
round
my
heart
grew
sick
as
i
regarded
visages
deformed
by
vice
and
listened
to
accounts
of
chicanery
that
was
continually
embroiling
the
ignorant
these
locusts
will
probably
diminish
as
the
people
become
more
enlightened
in
this
period
of
social
life
the
commonalty
are
always
cunningly
attentive
to
their
own
interest
but
their
faculties
confined
to
a
few
objects
are
so
narrowed
that
they
can
not
discover
it
in
the
general
good
the
profession
of
the
law
renders
a
set
of
men
still
shrewder
and
more
selfish
than
the
rest
and
it
is
these
men
whose
wits
have
been
sharpened
by
knavery
who
here
undermine
morality
confounding
right
and
wrong
the
count
of
bernstorff
who
really
appears
to
me
from
all
i
can
gather
to
have
the
good
of
the
people
at
heart
aware
of
this
has
lately
sent
to
the
mayor
of
each
district
to
name
according
to
the
size
of
the
place
four
or
six
of
the
inhabitants
not
men
of
the
law
out
of
which
the
citizens
were
to
elect
two
who
are
to
be
termed
mediators
their
office
is
to
endeavour
to
prevent
litigious
suits
and
conciliate
differences
and
no
suit
is
to
be
commenced
before
the
parties
have
discussed
the
dispute
at
their
weekly
meeting
if
a
reconciliation
should
in
consequence
take
place
it
is
to
be
registered
and
the
parties
are
not
allowed
to
retract
by
these
means
ignorant
people
will
be
prevented
from
applying
for
advice
to
men
who
may
justly
be
termed
of
strife
they
have
for
a
long
time
to
use
a
significant
vulgarism
set
the
people
by
the
ears
and
live
by
the
spoil
they
caught
up
in
the
scramble
there
is
some
reason
to
hope
that
this
regulation
will
diminish
their
number
and
restrain
their
mischievous
activity
but
till
trials
by
jury
are
established
little
justice
can
be
expected
in
norway
judges
who
can
not
be
bribed
are
often
timid
and
afraid
of
offending
bold
knaves
lest
they
should
raise
a
set
of
hornets
about
themselves
the
fear
of
censure
undermines
all
energy
of
character
and
labouring
to
be
prudent
they
lose
sight
of
rectitude
besides
nothing
is
left
to
their
conscience
or
sagacity
they
must
be
governed
by
evidence
though
internally
convinced
that
it
is
false
there
is
a
considerable
iron
manufactory
at
laurvig
for
coarse
work
and
a
lake
near
the
town
supplies
the
water
necessary
for
working
several
mills
belonging
to
it
this
establishment
belongs
to
the
count
of
laurvig
without
a
fortune
and
influence
equal
to
his
such
a
work
could
not
have
been
set
afloat
personal
fortunes
are
not
yet
sufficient
to
support
such
undertakings
nevertheless
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
speak
of
the
size
of
his
estate
as
an
evil
because
it
obstructs
commerce
the
occupiers
of
small
farms
are
obliged
to
bring
their
wood
to
the
neighbouring
seaports
to
be
shipped
but
he
wishing
to
increase
the
value
of
his
will
not
allow
it
to
be
thus
gradually
cut
down
which
turns
the
trade
into
another
channel
added
to
this
nature
is
against
them
the
bay
being
open
and
insecure
i
could
not
help
smiling
when
i
was
informed
that
in
a
hard
gale
a
vessel
had
been
wrecked
in
the
main
street
when
there
are
such
a
number
of
excellent
harbours
on
the
coast
it
is
a
pity
that
accident
has
made
one
of
the
largest
towns
grow
up
on
a
bad
one
the
father
of
the
present
count
was
a
distant
relation
of
the
family
he
resided
constantly
in
denmark
and
his
son
follows
his
example
they
have
not
been
in
possession
of
the
estate
many
years
and
their
predecessor
lived
near
the
town
introducing
a
degree
of
profligacy
of
manners
which
has
been
ruinous
to
the
inhabitants
in
every
respect
their
fortunes
not
being
equal
to
the
prevailing
extravagance
what
little
i
have
seen
of
the
manners
of
the
people
does
not
please
me
so
well
as
those
of
tonsberg
i
am
forewarned
that
i
shall
find
them
still
more
cunning
and
fraudulent
as
i
advance
towards
the
westward
in
proportion
as
traffic
takes
place
of
agriculture
for
their
towns
are
built
on
naked
rocks
the
streets
are
narrow
bridges
and
the
inhabitants
are
all
seafaring
men
or
owners
of
ships
who
keep
shops
the
inn
i
was
at
in
laurvig
this
journey
was
not
the
same
that
i
was
at
before
it
is
a
good
one
the
people
civil
and
the
accommodations
decent
they
seem
to
be
better
provided
in
sweden
but
in
justice
i
ought
to
add
that
they
charge
more
extravagantly
my
bill
at
tonsberg
was
also
much
higher
than
i
had
paid
in
sweden
and
much
higher
than
it
ought
to
have
been
where
provision
is
so
cheap
indeed
they
seem
to
consider
foreigners
as
strangers
whom
they
shall
never
see
again
and
may
fairly
pluck
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
western
coast
isolated
as
it
were
regard
those
of
the
east
almost
as
strangers
each
town
in
that
quarter
seems
to
be
a
great
family
suspicious
of
every
other
allowing
none
to
cheat
them
but
themselves
and
right
or
wrong
they
support
one
another
in
the
face
of
justice
on
this
journey
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
one
companion
with
more
enlarged
views
than
the
generality
of
his
countrymen
who
spoke
english
tolerably
i
was
informed
that
we
might
still
advance
a
mile
and
a
quarter
in
our
cabrioles
afterwards
there
was
no
choice
but
of
a
single
horse
and
wretched
path
or
a
boat
the
usual
mode
of
travelling
we
therefore
sent
our
baggage
forward
in
the
boat
and
followed
rather
slowly
for
the
road
was
rocky
and
sandy
we
passed
however
through
several
beech
groves
which
still
delighted
me
by
the
freshness
of
their
light
green
foliage
and
the
elegance
of
their
assemblage
forming
retreats
to
veil
without
obscuring
the
sun
i
was
surprised
at
approaching
the
water
to
find
a
little
cluster
of
houses
pleasantly
situated
and
an
excellent
inn
i
could
have
wished
to
have
remained
there
all
night
but
as
the
wind
was
fair
and
the
evening
fine
i
was
afraid
to
trust
to
the
wind
the
uncertain
wind
of
we
therefore
left
helgeraac
immediately
with
the
declining
sun
though
we
were
in
the
open
sea
we
sailed
more
amongst
the
rocks
and
islands
than
in
my
passage
from
stromstad
and
they
often
forced
very
picturesque
combinations
few
of
the
high
ridges
were
entirely
bare
the
seeds
of
some
pines
or
firs
had
been
wafted
by
the
winds
or
waves
and
they
stood
to
brave
the
elements
sitting
then
in
a
little
boat
on
the
ocean
amidst
strangers
with
sorrow
and
care
pressing
hard
on
me
buffeting
me
about
from
clime
to
clime
i
felt
like
the
lone
shrub
at
random
cast
that
sighs
and
trembles
at
each
blast
on
some
of
the
largest
rocks
there
were
actually
groves
the
retreat
of
foxes
and
hares
which
i
suppose
had
tripped
over
the
ice
during
the
winter
without
thinking
to
regain
the
main
land
before
the
thaw
several
of
the
islands
were
inhabited
by
pilots
and
the
norwegian
pilots
are
allowed
to
be
the
best
in
the
world
perfectly
acquainted
with
their
coast
and
ever
at
hand
to
observe
the
first
signal
or
sail
they
pay
a
small
tax
to
the
king
and
to
the
regulating
officer
and
enjoy
the
fruit
of
their
indefatigable
industry
one
of
the
islands
called
virgin
land
is
a
flat
with
some
depth
of
earth
extending
for
half
a
norwegian
mile
with
three
farms
on
it
tolerably
well
cultivated
on
some
of
the
bare
rocks
i
saw
straggling
houses
they
rose
above
the
denomination
of
huts
inhabited
by
fishermen
my
companions
assured
me
that
they
were
very
comfortable
dwellings
and
that
they
have
not
only
the
necessaries
but
even
what
might
be
reckoned
the
superfluities
of
life
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
go
on
shore
if
you
will
allow
me
to
give
that
name
to
shivering
rocks
to
ascertain
the
fact
but
rain
coming
on
and
the
night
growing
dark
the
pilot
declared
that
it
would
be
dangerous
for
us
to
attempt
to
go
to
the
place
of
our
destination
east
rusoer
a
norwegian
mile
and
a
half
further
and
we
determined
to
stop
for
the
night
at
a
little
haven
some
half
dozen
houses
scattered
under
the
curve
of
a
rock
though
it
became
darker
and
darker
our
pilot
avoided
the
blind
rocks
with
great
dexterity
it
was
about
ten
when
we
arrived
and
the
old
hostess
quickly
prepared
me
a
comfortable
bed
a
little
too
soft
or
so
but
i
was
weary
and
opening
the
window
to
admit
the
sweetest
of
breezes
to
fan
me
to
sleep
i
sunk
into
the
most
luxurious
rest
it
was
more
than
refreshing
the
hospitable
sprites
of
the
grots
surely
hovered
round
my
pillow
and
if
i
awoke
it
was
to
listen
to
the
melodious
whispering
of
the
wind
amongst
them
or
to
feel
the
mild
breath
of
morn
light
slumbers
produced
dreams
where
paradise
was
before
me
my
little
cherub
was
again
hiding
her
face
in
my
bosom
i
heard
her
sweet
cooing
beat
on
my
heart
from
the
cliffs
and
saw
her
tiny
footsteps
on
the
sands
hopes
seemed
like
the
rainbow
to
appear
in
the
clouds
of
sorrow
faint
yet
sufficient
to
amuse
away
despair
some
refreshing
but
heavy
showers
have
detained
us
and
here
i
am
writing
quite
alone
something
more
than
gay
for
which
i
want
a
name
i
could
almost
fancy
myself
in
nootka
sound
or
on
some
of
the
islands
on
the
coast
of
america
we
entered
by
a
narrow
pass
through
the
rocks
which
from
this
abode
appear
more
romantic
than
you
can
well
imagine
and
hanging
at
the
door
to
dry
add
to
the
illusion
it
is
indeed
a
corner
of
the
world
but
you
would
be
surprised
to
see
the
cleanliness
and
comfort
of
the
dwelling
the
shelves
are
not
only
shining
with
pewter
and
queen
ware
but
some
articles
in
silver
more
ponderous
it
is
true
than
elegant
the
linen
is
good
as
well
as
white
all
the
females
spin
and
there
is
a
loom
in
the
kitchen
a
sort
of
individual
taste
appeared
in
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
this
is
not
the
place
for
imitation
and
a
kindness
in
their
desire
to
oblige
how
superior
to
the
apish
politeness
of
the
towns
where
the
people
affecting
to
be
well
bred
fatigue
with
their
endless
ceremony
the
mistress
is
a
widow
her
daughter
is
married
to
a
pilot
and
has
three
cows
they
have
a
little
patch
of
land
at
about
the
distance
of
two
english
miles
where
they
make
hay
for
the
winter
which
they
bring
home
in
a
boat
they
live
here
very
cheap
getting
money
from
the
vessels
which
stress
of
weather
or
other
causes
bring
into
their
harbour
i
suspect
by
their
furniture
that
they
smuggle
a
little
i
can
now
credit
the
account
of
the
other
houses
which
i
last
night
thought
exaggerated
i
have
been
conversing
with
one
of
my
companions
respecting
the
laws
and
regulations
of
norway
he
is
a
man
within
great
portion
of
common
sense
and
heart
yes
a
warm
heart
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
remarked
heart
without
sentiment
they
are
distinct
the
former
depends
on
the
rectitude
of
the
feelings
on
truth
of
sympathy
these
characters
have
more
tenderness
than
passion
the
latter
has
a
higher
source
call
it
imagination
genius
or
what
you
will
it
is
something
very
different
i
have
been
laughing
with
these
simple
worthy
folk
to
give
you
one
of
my
danish
words
and
letting
as
much
of
my
heart
flow
out
in
sympathy
as
they
can
take
adieu
i
must
trip
up
the
rocks
the
rain
is
ever
let
me
catch
pleasure
on
the
wing
i
may
be
melancholy
now
all
my
nerves
keep
time
with
the
melody
of
nature
ah
let
me
be
happy
whilst
i
can
the
tear
starts
as
i
think
of
it
i
must
flee
from
thought
and
find
refuge
from
sorrow
in
a
strong
imagination
the
only
solace
for
a
feeling
heart
phantoms
of
bliss
ideal
forms
of
excellence
again
enclose
me
in
your
magic
circle
and
wipe
clear
from
my
remembrance
the
disappointments
that
reader
the
sympathy
painful
which
experience
rather
increases
than
damps
by
giving
the
indulgence
of
feeling
the
sanction
of
reason
once
more
farewell
letter
xi
i
left
portoer
the
little
haven
i
mentioned
soon
after
i
finished
my
last
letter
the
sea
was
rough
and
i
perceived
that
our
pilot
was
right
not
to
venture
farther
during
a
hazy
night
we
had
agreed
to
pay
four
dollars
for
a
boat
from
helgeraac
i
mention
the
sum
because
they
would
demand
twice
as
much
from
a
stranger
i
was
obliged
to
pay
fifteen
for
the
one
i
hired
at
stromstad
when
we
were
ready
to
set
out
our
boatman
offered
to
return
a
dollar
and
let
us
go
in
one
of
the
boats
of
the
place
the
pilot
who
lived
there
being
better
acquainted
with
the
coast
he
only
demanded
a
dollar
and
a
half
which
was
reasonable
i
found
him
a
civil
and
rather
intelligent
man
he
was
in
the
american
service
several
years
during
the
revolution
i
soon
perceived
that
an
experienced
mariner
was
necessary
to
guide
us
for
we
were
continually
obliged
to
tack
about
to
avoid
the
rocks
which
scarcely
reaching
to
the
surface
of
the
water
could
only
be
discovered
by
the
breaking
of
the
waves
over
them
the
view
of
this
wild
coast
as
we
sailed
along
it
afforded
me
a
continual
subject
for
meditation
i
anticipated
the
future
improvement
of
the
world
and
observed
how
much
man
has
still
to
do
to
obtain
of
the
earth
all
it
could
yield
i
even
carried
my
speculations
so
far
as
to
advance
a
million
or
two
of
years
to
the
moment
when
the
earth
would
perhaps
be
so
perfectly
cultivated
and
so
completely
peopled
as
to
render
it
necessary
to
inhabit
every
spot
yes
these
bleak
shores
imagination
went
still
farther
and
pictured
the
state
of
man
when
the
earth
could
no
longer
support
him
whither
was
he
to
flee
from
universal
famine
do
not
smile
i
really
became
distressed
for
these
fellow
creatures
yet
unborn
the
images
fastened
on
me
and
the
world
appeared
a
vast
prison
i
was
soon
to
be
in
a
smaller
one
for
no
other
name
can
i
give
to
rusoer
it
would
be
difficult
to
form
an
idea
of
the
place
if
you
have
never
seen
one
of
these
rocky
coasts
we
were
a
considerable
time
entering
amongst
the
islands
before
we
saw
about
two
hundred
houses
crowded
together
under
a
very
high
rock
still
higher
appearing
above
talk
not
of
bastilles
to
be
born
here
was
to
be
bastilled
by
nature
shut
out
from
all
that
opens
the
understanding
or
enlarges
the
heart
huddled
one
behind
another
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
dwellings
even
had
a
prospect
of
the
sea
a
few
planks
formed
passages
from
house
to
house
which
you
must
often
scale
mounting
steps
like
a
ladder
to
enter
the
only
road
across
the
rocks
leads
to
a
habitation
sterile
enough
you
may
suppose
when
i
tell
you
that
the
little
earth
on
the
adjacent
ones
was
carried
there
by
the
late
inhabitant
a
path
almost
impracticable
for
a
horse
goes
on
to
arendall
still
further
to
the
westward
i
inquired
for
a
walk
and
mounting
near
two
hundred
steps
made
round
a
rock
walked
up
and
down
for
about
a
hundred
yards
viewing
the
sea
to
which
i
quickly
descended
by
steps
that
cheated
the
declivity
the
ocean
and
these
tremendous
bulwarks
enclosed
me
on
every
side
i
felt
the
confinement
and
wished
for
wings
to
reach
still
loftier
cliffs
whose
slippery
sides
no
foot
was
so
hardy
as
to
tread
yet
what
was
it
to
see
only
a
boundless
waste
of
water
not
a
glimpse
of
smiling
nature
not
a
patch
of
lively
green
to
relieve
the
aching
sight
or
vary
the
objects
of
meditation
i
felt
my
breath
oppressed
though
nothing
could
be
clearer
than
the
atmosphere
wandering
there
alone
i
found
the
solitude
desirable
my
mind
was
stored
with
ideas
which
this
new
scene
associated
with
astonishing
rapidity
but
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
receiving
existence
and
remaining
here
in
the
solitude
of
ignorance
till
forced
to
leave
a
world
of
which
i
had
seen
so
little
for
the
character
of
the
inhabitants
is
as
uncultivated
if
not
as
picturesquely
wild
as
their
abode
having
no
employment
but
traffic
of
which
a
contraband
trade
makes
the
basis
of
their
profit
the
coarsest
feelings
of
honesty
are
quickly
blunted
you
may
suppose
that
i
speak
in
general
terms
and
that
with
all
the
disadvantages
of
nature
and
circumstances
there
are
still
some
respectable
exceptions
the
more
praiseworthy
as
tricking
is
a
very
contagious
mental
disease
that
dries
up
all
the
generous
juices
of
the
heart
nothing
genial
in
fact
appears
around
this
place
or
within
the
circle
of
its
rocks
and
now
i
recollect
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
genial
and
humane
characters
i
have
met
with
in
life
were
most
alive
to
the
sentiments
inspired
by
tranquil
country
scenes
what
indeed
is
to
humanise
these
beings
who
rest
shut
up
for
they
seldom
even
open
their
windows
smoking
drinking
brandy
and
driving
bargains
i
have
been
almost
stifled
by
these
smokers
they
begin
in
the
morning
and
are
rarely
without
their
pipe
till
they
go
to
bed
nothing
can
be
more
disgusting
than
the
rooms
and
men
towards
the
evening
breath
teeth
clothes
and
furniture
all
are
spoilt
it
is
well
that
the
women
are
not
very
delicate
or
they
would
only
love
their
husbands
because
they
were
their
husbands
perhaps
you
may
add
that
the
remark
need
not
be
confined
to
so
small
a
part
of
the
world
and
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
you
must
not
term
this
innuendo
saucy
for
it
does
not
come
home
if
i
had
not
determined
to
write
i
should
have
found
my
confinement
here
even
for
three
or
four
days
tedious
i
have
no
books
and
to
pace
up
and
down
a
small
room
looking
at
tiles
overhung
by
rocks
soon
becomes
wearisome
i
can
not
mount
two
hundred
steps
to
walk
a
hundred
yards
many
times
in
the
day
besides
the
rocks
retaining
the
heat
of
the
sun
are
intolerably
warm
i
am
nevertheless
very
well
for
though
there
is
a
shrewdness
in
the
character
of
these
people
depraved
by
a
sordid
love
of
money
which
repels
me
still
the
comparisons
they
force
me
to
make
keep
my
heart
calm
by
exercising
my
understanding
everywhere
wealth
commands
too
much
respect
but
here
almost
exclusively
and
it
is
the
only
object
pursued
not
through
brake
and
briar
but
over
rocks
and
waves
yet
of
what
use
would
riches
be
to
me
i
have
sometimes
asked
myself
were
i
confined
to
live
in
such
in
a
spot
i
could
only
relieve
a
few
distressed
objects
perhaps
render
them
idle
and
all
the
rest
of
life
would
be
a
blank
my
present
journey
has
given
fresh
force
to
my
opinion
that
no
place
is
so
disagreeable
and
unimproving
as
a
country
town
i
should
like
to
divide
my
time
between
the
town
and
country
in
a
lone
house
with
the
business
of
farming
and
planting
where
my
mind
would
gain
strength
by
solitary
musing
and
in
a
metropolis
to
rub
off
the
rust
of
thought
and
polish
the
taste
which
the
contemplation
of
nature
had
rendered
just
thus
do
we
wish
as
we
float
down
the
stream
of
life
whilst
chance
does
more
to
gratify
a
desire
of
knowledge
than
our
best
laid
plans
a
degree
of
exertion
produced
by
some
want
more
or
less
painful
is
probably
the
price
we
must
all
pay
for
knowledge
how
few
authors
or
artists
have
arrived
at
eminence
who
have
not
lived
by
their
employment
i
was
interrupted
yesterday
by
business
and
was
prevailed
upon
to
dine
with
the
english
his
house
being
open
to
the
sea
i
was
more
at
large
and
the
hospitality
of
the
table
pleased
me
though
the
bottle
was
rather
too
freely
pushed
about
their
manner
of
entertaining
was
such
as
i
have
frequently
remarked
when
i
have
been
thrown
in
the
way
of
people
without
education
who
have
more
money
than
wit
that
is
than
they
know
what
to
do
with
the
women
were
unaffected
but
had
not
the
natural
grace
which
was
often
conspicuous
at
tonsberg
there
was
even
a
striking
difference
in
their
dress
these
having
loaded
themselves
with
finery
in
the
style
of
the
sailors
girls
of
hull
or
portsmouth
taste
has
not
yet
taught
them
to
make
any
but
an
ostentatious
display
of
wealth
yet
i
could
perceive
even
here
the
first
steps
of
the
improvement
which
i
am
persuaded
will
make
a
very
obvious
progress
in
the
course
of
half
a
century
and
it
ought
not
to
be
sooner
to
keep
pace
with
the
cultivation
of
the
earth
improving
manners
will
introduce
finer
moral
feelings
they
begin
to
read
translations
of
some
of
the
most
useful
german
productions
lately
published
and
one
of
our
party
sung
a
song
ridiculing
the
powers
coalesced
against
france
and
the
company
drank
confusion
to
those
who
had
dismembered
poland
the
evening
was
extremely
calm
and
beautiful
not
being
able
to
walk
i
requested
a
boat
as
the
only
means
of
enjoying
free
air
the
view
of
the
town
was
now
extremely
fine
a
huge
rocky
mountain
stood
up
behind
it
and
a
vast
cliff
stretched
on
each
side
forming
a
semicircle
in
a
recess
of
the
rocks
was
a
clump
of
pines
amongst
which
a
steeple
rose
picturesquely
beautiful
the
churchyard
is
almost
the
only
verdant
spot
in
the
place
here
indeed
friendship
extends
beyond
the
grave
and
to
grant
a
sod
of
earth
is
to
accord
a
favour
i
should
rather
choose
did
it
admit
of
a
choice
to
sleep
in
some
of
the
caves
of
the
rocks
for
i
am
become
better
reconciled
to
them
since
i
climbed
their
craggy
sides
last
night
listening
to
the
finest
echoes
i
ever
heard
we
had
a
french
horn
with
us
and
there
was
an
enchanting
wildness
in
the
dying
away
of
the
reverberation
that
quickly
transported
me
to
shakespeare
magic
island
spirits
unseen
seemed
to
walk
abroad
and
flit
from
cliff
to
cliff
to
soothe
my
soul
to
peace
i
reluctantly
returned
to
supper
to
be
shut
up
in
a
warm
room
only
to
view
the
vast
shadows
of
the
rocks
extending
on
the
slumbering
waves
i
stood
at
the
window
some
time
before
a
buzz
filled
the
and
now
and
then
the
dashing
of
a
solitary
oar
rendered
the
scene
still
more
solemn
before
i
came
here
i
could
scarcely
have
imagined
that
a
simple
object
rocks
could
have
admitted
of
so
many
interesting
combinations
always
grand
and
often
sublime
good
night
god
bless
you
letter
xii
i
left
east
rusoer
the
day
before
yesterday
the
weather
was
very
fine
but
so
calm
that
we
loitered
on
the
water
near
fourteen
hours
only
to
make
about
six
and
twenty
miles
it
seemed
to
me
a
sort
of
emancipation
when
we
landed
at
helgeraac
the
confinement
which
everywhere
struck
me
whilst
sojourning
amongst
the
rocks
made
me
hail
the
earth
as
a
land
of
promise
and
the
situation
shone
with
fresh
lustre
from
the
contrast
from
appearing
to
be
a
free
abode
here
it
was
possible
to
travel
by
land
i
never
thought
this
a
comfort
before
and
my
eyes
fatigued
by
the
sparkling
of
the
sun
on
the
water
now
contentedly
reposed
on
the
green
expanse
half
persuaded
that
such
verdant
meads
had
never
till
then
regaled
them
i
rose
early
to
pursue
my
journey
to
tonsberg
the
country
still
wore
a
face
of
joy
and
my
soul
was
alive
to
its
charms
leaving
the
most
lofty
and
romantic
of
the
cliffs
behind
us
we
were
almost
continually
descending
to
tonsberg
through
elysian
scenes
for
not
only
the
sea
but
mountains
rivers
lakes
and
groves
gave
an
almost
endless
variety
to
the
prospect
the
cottagers
were
still
carrying
home
the
hay
and
the
cottages
on
this
road
looked
very
comfortable
peace
and
plenty
i
mean
not
abundance
seemed
to
reign
around
still
i
grew
sad
as
i
drew
near
my
old
abode
i
was
sorry
to
see
the
sun
so
high
it
was
broad
noon
tonsberg
was
something
like
a
home
yet
i
was
to
enter
without
lighting
up
pleasure
in
any
eye
i
dreaded
the
solitariness
of
my
apartment
and
wished
for
night
to
hide
the
starting
tears
or
to
shed
them
on
my
pillow
and
close
my
eyes
on
a
world
where
i
was
destined
to
wander
alone
why
has
nature
so
many
charms
for
me
calling
forth
and
cherishing
refined
sentiments
only
to
wound
the
breast
that
fosters
them
how
illusive
perhaps
the
most
so
are
the
plans
of
happiness
founded
on
virtue
and
principle
what
inlets
of
misery
do
they
not
open
in
a
society
the
satisfaction
arising
from
conscious
rectitude
will
not
calm
an
injured
heart
when
tenderness
is
ever
finding
excuses
and
is
a
cold
solitary
feeling
that
can
not
supply
the
place
of
disappointed
affection
without
throwing
a
gloom
over
every
prospect
which
banishing
pleasure
does
not
exclude
pain
i
reasoned
and
reasoned
but
my
heart
was
too
full
to
allow
me
to
remain
in
the
house
and
i
walked
till
i
was
wearied
out
to
purchase
rest
or
rather
forgetfulness
employment
has
beguiled
this
day
and
i
set
out
for
moss
on
my
way
to
stromstad
at
gothenburg
i
shall
embrace
my
fannikin
probably
she
will
not
know
me
again
and
i
shall
be
hurt
if
she
do
not
how
childish
is
this
still
it
is
a
natural
feeling
i
would
not
permit
myself
to
indulge
the
thick
coming
fears
of
fondness
whilst
i
was
detained
by
business
yet
i
never
saw
a
calf
bounding
in
a
meadow
that
did
not
remind
me
of
my
little
frolicker
a
calf
you
say
yes
but
a
capital
one
i
own
i
can
not
write
composedly
i
am
every
instant
sinking
into
reveries
my
heart
flutters
i
know
not
why
fool
it
is
time
thou
wert
at
rest
friendship
and
domestic
happiness
are
continually
praised
yet
how
little
is
there
of
either
in
the
world
because
it
requires
more
cultivation
of
mind
to
keep
awake
affection
even
in
our
own
hearts
than
the
common
run
of
people
suppose
besides
few
like
to
be
seen
as
they
really
are
and
a
degree
of
simplicity
and
of
undisguised
confidence
which
to
uninterested
observers
would
almost
border
on
weakness
is
the
charm
nay
the
essence
of
love
or
friendship
all
the
bewitching
graces
of
childhood
again
appearing
as
objects
merely
to
exercise
my
taste
i
therefore
like
to
see
people
together
who
have
an
affection
for
each
other
every
turn
of
their
features
touches
me
and
remains
pictured
on
my
imagination
in
indelible
characters
the
zest
of
novelty
is
however
necessary
to
rouse
the
languid
sympathies
which
have
been
hackneyed
in
the
world
as
is
the
factitious
behaviour
falsely
termed
to
amuse
those
who
defective
in
taste
continually
rely
for
pleasure
on
their
animal
spirits
which
not
being
maintained
by
the
imagination
are
unavoidably
sooner
exhausted
than
the
sentiments
of
the
heart
friendship
is
in
general
sincere
at
the
commencement
and
lasts
whilst
there
is
anything
to
support
it
but
as
a
mixture
of
novelty
and
vanity
is
the
usual
prop
no
wonder
if
it
fall
with
the
slender
stay
the
fop
in
the
play
paid
a
greater
compliment
than
he
was
aware
of
when
he
said
to
a
person
whom
he
meant
to
flatter
i
like
you
almost
as
well
as
a
why
am
i
talking
of
friendship
after
which
i
have
had
such
a
chase
i
thought
only
of
telling
you
that
the
crows
as
well
as
are
here
birds
of
passage
letter
xiii
i
left
tonsberg
yesterday
the
of
august
it
is
only
twelve
or
thirteen
english
miles
to
moss
through
a
country
less
wild
than
any
tract
i
had
hitherto
passed
over
in
norway
it
was
often
beautiful
but
seldom
afforded
those
grand
views
which
fill
rather
than
soothe
the
mind
we
glided
along
the
meadows
and
through
the
woods
with
sunbeams
playing
around
us
and
though
no
castles
adorned
the
prospects
a
greater
number
of
comfortable
farms
met
my
eyes
during
this
ride
than
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
same
space
even
in
the
most
cultivated
part
of
england
and
the
very
appearance
of
the
cottages
of
the
labourers
sprinkled
amidst
them
excluded
all
those
gloomy
ideas
inspired
by
the
contemplation
of
poverty
the
hay
was
still
bringing
in
for
one
harvest
in
norway
treads
on
the
heels
of
the
other
the
woods
were
more
variegated
interspersed
with
shrubs
we
no
longer
passed
through
forests
of
vast
pines
stretching
along
with
savage
magnificence
forests
that
only
exhibited
the
slow
decay
of
time
or
the
devastation
produced
by
warring
elements
no
oaks
ashes
beech
and
all
the
light
and
graceful
tenants
of
our
woods
here
sported
luxuriantly
i
had
not
observed
many
oaks
before
for
the
greater
part
of
the
i
am
informed
come
from
the
westward
in
france
the
farmers
generally
live
in
villages
which
is
a
great
disadvantage
to
the
country
but
the
norwegian
farmers
always
owning
their
farms
or
being
tenants
for
life
reside
in
the
midst
of
them
allowing
some
labourers
a
dwelling
rent
free
who
have
a
little
land
appertaining
to
the
cottage
not
only
for
a
garden
but
for
crops
of
different
kinds
such
as
rye
oats
hemp
flax
beans
potatoes
and
hay
which
are
sown
in
strips
about
it
reminding
a
stranger
of
the
first
attempts
at
culture
when
every
family
was
obliged
to
be
an
independent
community
these
cottagers
work
at
a
certain
price
tenpence
per
day
for
the
farmers
on
whose
ground
they
live
and
they
have
spare
time
enough
to
cultivate
their
own
land
and
lay
in
a
store
of
fish
for
the
winter
the
wives
and
daughters
spin
and
the
husbands
and
sons
weave
so
that
they
may
fairly
be
reckoned
independent
having
also
a
little
money
in
hand
to
buy
coffee
brandy
and
some
other
superfluities
the
only
thing
i
disliked
was
the
military
service
which
trammels
them
more
than
i
at
first
imagined
it
is
true
that
the
militia
is
only
called
out
once
a
year
yet
in
case
of
war
they
have
no
alternative
but
must
abandon
their
families
even
the
manufacturers
are
not
exempted
though
the
miners
are
in
order
to
encourage
undertakings
which
require
a
capital
at
the
commencement
and
what
appears
more
tyrannical
the
inhabitants
of
certain
districts
are
appointed
for
the
land
others
for
the
sea
service
consequently
a
peasant
born
a
soldier
is
not
permitted
to
follow
his
inclination
should
it
lead
him
to
go
to
sea
a
natural
desire
near
so
many
seaports
in
these
regulations
the
arbitrary
government
the
king
of
denmark
being
the
most
absolute
monarch
in
europe
appears
which
in
other
respects
seeks
to
hide
itself
in
a
lenity
that
almost
renders
the
laws
nullities
if
any
alteration
of
old
customs
is
thought
of
the
opinion
of
the
old
country
is
required
and
maturely
considered
i
have
several
times
had
occasion
to
observe
that
fearing
to
appear
tyrannical
laws
are
allowed
to
become
obsolete
which
ought
to
be
put
in
force
or
better
substituted
in
their
stead
for
this
mistaken
moderation
which
borders
on
timidity
favours
the
least
respectable
part
of
the
people
i
saw
on
my
way
not
only
good
parsonage
houses
but
comfortable
dwellings
with
glebe
land
for
the
clerk
always
a
consequential
man
in
every
country
a
being
proud
of
a
little
smattering
of
learning
to
use
the
appropriate
epithet
and
vain
of
the
stiff
reflected
from
the
vicar
though
the
servility
practised
in
his
company
gives
it
a
peculiar
cast
the
widow
of
the
clergyman
is
allowed
to
receive
the
benefit
of
the
living
for
a
twelvemonth
after
the
death
of
the
incumbent
arriving
at
the
ferry
the
passage
over
to
moss
is
about
six
or
eight
english
miles
i
saw
the
most
level
shore
i
had
yet
seen
in
norway
the
appearance
of
the
circumjacent
country
had
been
preparing
me
for
the
change
of
scene
which
was
to
greet
me
when
i
reached
the
coast
for
the
grand
features
of
nature
had
been
dwindling
into
prettiness
as
i
advanced
yet
the
rocks
on
a
smaller
scale
were
finely
wooded
to
the
water
edge
little
art
appeared
yet
sublimity
everywhere
gave
place
to
elegance
the
road
had
often
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
gravelled
one
made
in
whilst
the
trees
excited
only
an
idea
of
embellishment
meadows
like
lawns
in
an
endless
variety
displayed
the
careless
graces
of
nature
and
the
ripening
corn
gave
a
richness
to
the
landscape
analogous
with
the
other
objects
never
was
a
southern
sky
more
beautiful
nor
more
soft
its
gales
indeed
i
am
led
to
conclude
that
the
sweetest
summer
in
the
world
is
the
northern
one
the
vegetation
being
quick
and
luxuriant
the
moment
the
earth
is
loosened
from
its
icy
fetters
and
the
bound
streams
regain
their
wonted
activity
the
balance
of
happiness
with
respect
to
climate
may
be
more
equal
than
i
at
first
imagined
for
the
inhabitants
describe
with
warmth
the
pleasures
of
a
winter
at
the
thoughts
of
which
i
shudder
not
only
their
parties
of
pleasure
but
of
business
are
reserved
for
this
season
when
they
travel
with
astonishing
rapidity
the
most
direct
way
skimming
over
hedge
and
ditch
on
entering
moss
i
was
struck
by
the
animation
which
seemed
to
result
from
industry
the
richest
of
the
inhabitants
keep
shops
resembling
in
their
manners
and
even
the
arrangement
of
their
houses
the
tradespeople
of
yorkshire
with
an
air
of
more
independence
or
rather
consequence
from
feeling
themselves
the
first
people
in
the
place
i
had
not
time
to
see
the
belonging
to
anker
of
christiania
a
man
of
fortune
and
enterprise
and
i
was
not
very
anxious
to
see
them
after
having
viewed
those
at
laurvig
here
i
met
with
an
intelligent
literary
man
who
was
anxious
to
gather
information
from
me
relative
to
the
past
and
present
situation
of
france
the
newspapers
printed
at
copenhagen
as
well
as
those
in
england
give
the
most
exaggerated
accounts
of
their
atrocities
and
distresses
but
the
former
without
any
apparent
comments
or
inferences
still
the
norwegians
though
more
connected
with
the
english
speaking
their
language
and
copying
their
manners
wish
well
to
the
republican
cause
and
follow
with
the
most
lively
interest
the
successes
of
the
french
arms
so
determined
were
they
in
fact
to
excuse
everything
disgracing
the
struggle
of
freedom
by
admitting
the
tyrant
plea
necessity
that
i
could
hardly
persuade
them
that
robespierre
was
a
monster
the
discussion
of
this
subject
is
not
so
general
as
in
england
being
confined
to
the
few
the
clergy
and
physicians
with
a
small
portion
of
people
who
have
a
literary
turn
and
leisure
the
greater
part
of
the
inhabitants
having
a
variety
of
occupations
being
owners
of
ships
shopkeepers
and
farmers
have
employment
enough
at
home
and
their
ambition
to
become
rich
may
tend
to
cultivate
the
common
sense
which
characterises
and
narrows
both
their
hearts
and
views
confirming
the
former
to
their
families
taking
the
handmaids
of
it
into
the
circle
of
pleasure
if
not
of
interest
and
the
latter
to
the
inspection
of
their
workmen
including
the
noble
science
of
that
is
getting
everything
at
the
cheapest
and
selling
it
at
the
dearest
rate
i
am
now
more
than
ever
convinced
that
it
is
an
intercourse
with
men
of
science
and
artists
which
not
only
diffuses
taste
but
gives
that
freedom
to
the
understanding
without
which
i
have
seldom
met
with
much
benevolence
of
character
on
a
large
scale
besides
though
you
do
not
hear
of
much
pilfering
and
stealing
in
norway
yet
they
will
with
a
quiet
conscience
buy
things
at
a
price
which
must
convince
them
they
were
stolen
i
had
an
opportunity
of
knowing
that
two
or
three
reputable
people
had
purchased
some
articles
of
vagrants
who
were
detected
how
much
of
the
virtue
which
appears
in
the
world
is
put
on
for
the
world
and
how
little
dictated
by
so
little
that
i
am
ready
to
repeat
the
old
question
and
ask
where
is
truth
or
rather
principle
to
be
found
these
are
perhaps
the
vapourings
of
a
heart
ill
at
ease
the
effusions
of
a
sensibility
wounded
almost
to
madness
but
enough
of
this
we
will
discuss
the
subject
in
another
state
of
existence
where
truth
and
justice
will
reign
how
cruel
are
the
injuries
which
make
us
quarrel
with
human
nature
at
present
black
melancholy
hovers
round
my
footsteps
and
sorrow
sheds
a
mildew
over
all
the
future
prospects
which
hope
no
longer
gilds
a
rainy
morning
prevented
my
enjoying
the
pleasure
the
view
of
a
picturesque
country
would
have
afforded
me
for
though
this
road
passed
through
a
country
a
greater
extent
of
which
was
under
cultivation
than
i
had
usually
seen
here
it
nevertheless
retained
all
the
wild
charms
of
norway
rocks
still
enclosed
the
valleys
the
great
sides
of
which
enlivened
their
verdure
lakes
appeared
like
branches
of
the
sea
and
branches
of
the
sea
assumed
the
appearance
of
tranquil
lakes
whilst
streamlets
prattled
amongst
the
pebbles
and
the
broken
mass
of
stone
which
had
rolled
into
them
giving
fantastic
turns
to
the
trees
the
roots
of
which
they
bared
it
is
not
in
fact
surprising
that
the
pine
should
be
often
undermined
it
shoots
its
fibres
in
such
a
horizontal
direction
merely
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
requiring
only
enough
to
cover
those
that
cling
to
the
crags
nothing
proves
to
me
so
clearly
that
it
is
the
air
which
principally
nourishes
trees
and
plants
as
the
flourishing
appearance
of
these
pines
the
firs
demanding
a
deeper
soil
are
seldom
seen
in
equal
health
or
so
numerous
on
the
barren
cliffs
they
take
shelter
in
the
crevices
or
where
after
some
revolving
ages
the
pines
have
prepared
them
a
footing
approaching
or
rather
descending
to
christiania
though
the
weather
continued
a
little
cloudy
my
eyes
were
charmed
with
the
view
of
an
extensive
undulated
valley
stretching
out
under
the
shelter
of
a
noble
amphitheatre
of
mountains
farm
houses
scattered
about
animated
nay
graced
a
scene
which
still
retained
so
much
of
its
native
wildness
that
the
art
which
appeared
seemed
so
necessary
it
was
scarcely
perceived
cattle
were
grazing
in
the
shaven
meadows
and
the
lively
green
on
their
swelling
sides
contrasted
with
the
ripening
corn
and
rye
the
corn
that
grew
on
the
slopes
had
not
indeed
the
laughing
luxuriance
of
plenty
which
i
have
seen
in
more
genial
climes
a
fresh
breeze
swept
across
the
grain
parting
its
slender
stalks
but
the
wheat
did
not
wave
its
head
with
its
wonted
careless
dignity
as
if
nature
had
crowned
it
the
king
of
plants
the
view
immediately
on
the
left
as
we
drove
down
the
mountain
was
almost
spoilt
by
the
depredations
committed
on
the
rocks
to
make
alum
i
do
not
know
the
process
i
only
saw
that
the
rocks
looked
red
after
they
had
been
burnt
and
regretted
that
the
operation
should
leave
a
quantity
of
rubbish
to
introduce
an
image
of
human
industry
in
the
shape
of
destruction
the
situation
of
christiania
is
certainly
uncommonly
fine
and
i
never
saw
a
bay
that
so
forcibly
gave
me
an
idea
of
a
place
of
safety
from
the
storms
of
the
ocean
all
the
surrounding
objects
were
beautiful
and
even
grand
but
neither
the
rocky
mountains
nor
the
woods
that
graced
them
could
be
compared
with
the
sublime
prospects
i
had
seen
to
the
westward
and
as
for
the
hills
capped
with
snow
coxe
description
led
me
to
look
for
them
but
they
had
flown
for
i
looked
vainly
around
for
this
noble
background
a
few
months
ago
the
people
of
christiania
rose
exasperated
by
the
scarcity
and
consequent
high
price
of
grain
the
immediate
cause
was
the
shipping
of
some
said
to
be
for
moss
but
which
they
suspected
was
only
a
pretext
to
send
it
out
of
the
country
and
i
am
not
sure
that
they
were
wrong
in
their
conjecture
such
are
the
tricks
of
trade
they
threw
stones
at
anker
the
owner
of
it
as
he
rode
out
of
town
to
escape
from
their
fury
they
assembled
about
his
house
and
the
people
demanded
afterwards
with
so
much
impetuosity
the
liberty
of
those
who
were
taken
up
in
consequence
of
the
tumult
that
the
grand
bailiff
thought
it
prudent
to
release
them
without
further
altercation
you
may
think
me
too
severe
on
commerce
but
from
the
manner
it
is
at
present
carried
on
little
can
be
advanced
in
favour
of
a
pursuit
that
wears
out
the
most
sacred
principles
of
humanity
and
rectitude
what
is
speculation
but
a
species
of
gambling
i
might
have
said
fraud
in
which
address
generally
gains
the
prize
i
was
led
into
these
reflections
when
i
heard
of
some
tricks
practised
by
merchants
miscalled
reputable
and
certainly
men
of
property
during
the
present
war
in
which
common
honesty
was
violated
damaged
goods
and
provision
having
been
shipped
for
the
express
purpose
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
english
who
had
pledged
themselves
to
reimburse
neutral
nations
for
the
cargoes
they
seized
cannon
also
sent
back
as
unfit
for
service
have
been
shipped
as
a
good
speculation
the
captain
receiving
orders
to
cruise
about
till
he
fell
in
with
an
english
frigate
many
individuals
i
believe
have
suffered
by
the
seizures
of
their
vessels
still
i
am
persuaded
that
the
english
government
has
been
very
much
imposed
upon
in
the
charges
made
by
merchants
who
contrived
to
get
their
ships
taken
this
censure
is
not
confined
to
the
danes
adieu
for
the
present
i
must
take
advantage
of
a
moment
of
fine
weather
to
walk
out
and
see
the
town
at
christiania
i
met
with
that
polite
reception
which
rather
characterises
the
progress
of
manners
in
the
world
than
of
any
particular
portion
of
it
the
first
evening
of
my
arrival
i
supped
with
some
of
the
most
fashionable
people
of
the
place
and
almost
imagined
myself
in
a
circle
of
english
ladies
so
much
did
they
resemble
them
in
manners
dress
and
even
in
beauty
for
the
fairest
of
my
countrywomen
would
not
have
been
sorry
to
rank
with
the
grand
bailiff
lady
there
were
several
pretty
girls
present
but
she
outshone
them
all
and
what
interested
me
still
more
i
could
not
avoid
observing
that
in
acquiring
the
easy
politeness
which
distinguishes
people
of
quality
she
had
preserved
her
norwegian
simplicity
there
was
in
fact
a
graceful
timidity
in
her
address
inexpressibly
charming
this
surprised
me
a
little
because
her
husband
was
quite
a
frenchman
of
the
or
rather
a
courtier
the
same
kind
of
animal
in
every
country
here
i
saw
the
cloven
foot
of
despotism
i
boasted
to
you
that
they
had
no
viceroy
in
norway
but
these
grand
bailiffs
particularly
the
superior
one
who
resides
at
christiania
are
political
monsters
of
the
same
species
needy
sycophants
are
provided
for
by
their
relations
and
connections
at
copenhagen
as
at
other
courts
and
though
the
norwegians
are
not
in
the
abject
state
of
the
irish
yet
this
government
is
still
felt
by
their
being
deprived
of
several
natural
advantages
to
benefit
the
domineering
state
the
grand
bailiffs
are
mostly
noblemen
from
copenhagen
who
act
as
men
of
common
minds
will
always
act
in
such
situations
aping
a
degree
of
courtly
parade
which
clashes
with
the
independent
character
of
a
magistrate
besides
they
have
a
degree
of
power
over
the
country
judges
which
some
of
them
who
exercise
a
jurisdiction
truly
patriarchal
most
painfully
feel
i
can
scarcely
say
why
my
friend
but
in
this
city
thoughtfulness
seemed
to
be
sliding
into
melancholy
or
rather
dulness
the
fire
of
fancy
which
had
been
kept
alive
in
the
country
was
almost
extinguished
by
reflections
on
the
ills
that
harass
such
a
large
portion
of
mankind
i
felt
like
a
bird
fluttering
on
the
ground
unable
to
mount
yet
unwilling
to
crawl
tranquilly
like
a
reptile
whilst
still
conscious
it
had
wings
i
walked
out
for
the
open
air
is
always
my
remedy
when
an
aching
head
proceeds
from
an
oppressed
heart
chance
directed
my
steps
towards
the
fortress
and
the
sight
of
the
slaves
working
with
chains
on
their
legs
only
served
to
embitter
me
still
more
against
the
regulations
of
society
which
treated
knaves
in
such
a
different
manner
especially
as
there
was
a
degree
of
energy
in
some
of
their
countenances
which
unavoidably
excited
my
attention
and
almost
created
respect
i
wished
to
have
seen
through
an
iron
grate
the
face
of
a
man
who
has
been
confined
six
years
for
having
induced
the
farmers
to
revolt
against
some
impositions
of
the
government
i
could
not
obtain
a
clear
account
of
the
affair
yet
as
the
complaint
was
against
some
farmers
of
taxes
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
it
was
not
totally
without
foundation
he
must
have
possessed
some
eloquence
or
have
had
truth
on
his
side
for
the
farmers
rose
by
hundreds
to
support
him
and
were
very
much
exasperated
at
his
imprisonment
which
will
probably
last
for
life
though
he
has
sent
several
very
spirited
remonstrances
to
the
upper
court
which
makes
the
judges
so
averse
to
giving
a
sentence
which
may
be
cavilled
at
that
they
take
advantage
of
the
glorious
uncertainty
of
the
law
to
protract
a
decision
which
is
only
to
be
regulated
by
reasons
of
state
the
greater
number
of
the
slaves
i
saw
here
were
not
confined
for
life
their
labour
is
not
hard
and
they
work
in
the
open
air
which
prevents
their
constitutions
from
suffering
by
imprisonment
still
as
they
are
allowed
to
associate
together
and
boast
of
their
dexterity
not
only
to
each
other
but
to
the
soldiers
around
them
in
the
garrison
they
commonly
it
is
natural
to
conclude
go
out
more
confirmed
and
more
expert
knaves
than
when
they
entered
it
is
not
necessary
to
trace
the
origin
of
the
association
of
ideas
which
led
me
to
think
that
the
stars
and
gold
keys
which
surrounded
me
the
evening
before
disgraced
the
wearers
as
much
as
the
fetters
i
was
viewing
perhaps
more
i
even
began
to
investigate
the
reason
which
led
me
to
suspect
that
the
former
produced
the
latter
the
norwegians
are
extravagantly
fond
of
courtly
distinction
and
of
titles
though
they
have
no
immunities
annexed
to
them
and
are
easily
purchased
the
proprietors
of
mines
have
many
privileges
they
are
almost
exempt
from
taxes
and
the
peasantry
born
on
their
estates
as
well
as
those
on
the
counts
are
not
born
soldiers
or
sailors
one
distinction
or
rather
trophy
of
nobility
which
i
might
have
occurred
to
the
hottentots
amused
me
it
was
a
bunch
of
hog
bristles
placed
on
the
horses
heads
surmounting
that
part
of
the
harness
to
which
a
round
piece
of
brass
often
dangles
fatiguing
the
eye
with
its
idle
motion
from
the
fortress
i
returned
to
my
lodging
and
quickly
was
taken
out
of
town
to
be
shown
a
pretty
villa
and
english
garden
to
a
norwegian
both
might
have
been
objects
of
curiosity
and
of
use
by
exciting
to
the
comparison
which
leads
to
improvement
but
whilst
i
gazed
i
was
employed
in
restoring
the
place
to
nature
or
taste
by
giving
it
the
character
of
the
surrounding
scene
serpentine
walks
and
looked
trifling
in
a
grand
recess
of
the
rooks
shaded
by
towering
pines
groves
of
smaller
trees
might
have
been
sheltered
under
them
which
would
have
melted
into
the
landscape
displaying
only
the
art
which
ought
to
point
out
the
vicinity
of
a
human
abode
furnished
with
some
elegance
but
few
people
have
sufficient
taste
to
discern
that
the
art
of
embellishing
consists
in
interesting
not
in
astonishing
christiania
is
certainly
very
pleasantly
situated
and
the
environs
i
passed
through
during
this
ride
afforded
many
fine
and
cultivated
prospects
but
excepting
the
first
view
approaching
to
it
rarely
present
any
combination
of
objects
so
strikingly
new
or
picturesque
as
to
command
remembrance
adieu
letter
xiv
christiania
is
a
clean
neat
city
but
it
has
none
of
the
graces
of
architecture
which
ought
to
keep
pace
with
the
refining
manners
of
a
people
or
the
outside
of
the
house
will
disgrace
the
inside
giving
the
beholder
an
idea
of
overgrown
wealth
devoid
of
taste
large
square
wooden
houses
offend
the
eye
displaying
more
than
gothic
barbarism
huge
gothic
piles
indeed
exhibit
a
characteristic
sublimity
and
a
wildness
of
fancy
peculiar
to
the
period
when
they
were
erected
but
size
without
grandeur
or
elegance
has
an
emphatical
stamp
of
meanness
of
poverty
of
conception
which
only
a
commercial
spirit
could
give
the
same
thought
has
struck
me
when
i
have
entered
the
of
my
respected
friend
price
i
am
surprised
that
the
dissenters
who
have
not
laid
aside
all
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
life
should
imagine
a
noble
pillar
or
arch
unhallowed
whilst
men
have
senses
whatever
soothes
them
lends
wings
to
devotion
else
why
do
the
beauties
of
nature
where
all
that
charm
them
are
spread
around
with
a
lavish
hand
force
even
the
sorrowing
heart
to
acknowledge
that
existence
is
a
blessing
and
this
acknowledgment
is
the
most
sublime
homage
we
can
pay
to
the
deity
the
argument
of
convenience
is
absurd
who
would
labour
for
wealth
if
it
were
to
procure
nothing
but
conveniences
if
we
wish
to
render
mankind
moral
from
principle
we
must
i
am
persuaded
give
a
greater
scope
to
the
enjoyments
of
the
senses
by
blending
taste
with
them
this
has
frequently
occurred
to
me
since
i
have
been
in
the
north
and
observed
that
there
sanguine
characters
always
take
refuge
in
drunkenness
after
the
fire
of
youth
is
spent
but
i
have
flown
from
norway
to
go
back
to
the
wooden
houses
farms
constructed
with
logs
and
even
little
villages
here
erected
in
the
same
simple
manner
have
appeared
to
me
very
picturesque
in
the
more
remote
parts
i
had
been
particularly
pleased
with
many
cottages
situated
close
to
a
brook
or
bordering
on
a
lake
with
the
whole
farm
contiguous
as
the
family
increases
a
little
more
land
is
cultivated
thus
the
country
is
obviously
enriched
by
population
formerly
the
farmers
might
more
justly
have
been
termed
woodcutters
but
now
they
find
it
necessary
to
spare
the
woods
a
little
and
this
change
will
be
universally
beneficial
for
whilst
they
lived
entirely
by
selling
the
trees
they
felled
they
did
not
pay
sufficient
attention
to
husbandry
consequently
advanced
very
slowly
in
agricultural
knowledge
necessity
will
in
future
more
and
more
spur
them
on
for
the
ground
cleared
of
wood
must
be
cultivated
or
the
farm
loses
its
value
there
is
no
waiting
for
food
till
another
generation
of
pines
be
grown
to
maturity
the
people
of
property
are
very
careful
of
their
timber
and
rambling
through
a
forest
near
tonsberg
belonging
to
the
count
i
have
stopped
to
admire
the
appearance
of
some
of
the
cottages
inhabited
by
a
family
a
man
employed
to
cut
down
the
wood
necessary
for
the
household
and
the
estate
a
little
lawn
was
cleared
on
which
several
lofty
trees
were
left
which
nature
had
grouped
whilst
the
encircling
firs
sported
with
wild
grace
the
dwelling
was
sheltered
by
the
forest
noble
pines
spreading
their
branches
over
the
roof
and
before
the
door
a
cow
goat
nag
and
children
seemed
equally
content
with
their
lot
and
if
contentment
be
all
we
can
attain
it
is
perhaps
best
secured
by
ignorance
as
i
have
been
most
delighted
with
the
country
parts
of
norway
i
was
sorry
to
leave
christiania
without
going
farther
to
the
north
though
the
advancing
season
admonished
me
to
depart
as
well
as
the
calls
of
business
and
affection
june
and
july
are
the
months
to
make
a
tour
through
norway
for
then
the
evenings
and
nights
are
the
finest
i
have
ever
seen
but
towards
the
middle
or
latter
end
of
august
the
clouds
begin
to
gather
and
summer
disappears
almost
before
it
has
ripened
the
fruit
of
autumn
even
as
it
were
slips
from
your
embraces
whilst
the
satisfied
senses
seem
to
rest
in
enjoyment
you
will
ask
perhaps
why
i
wished
to
go
farther
northward
why
not
only
because
the
country
from
all
i
can
gather
is
most
romantic
abounding
in
forests
and
lakes
and
the
air
pure
but
i
have
heard
much
of
the
intelligence
of
the
inhabitants
substantial
farmers
who
have
none
of
that
cunning
to
contaminate
their
simplicity
which
displeased
me
so
much
in
the
conduct
of
the
people
on
the
sea
coast
a
man
who
has
been
detected
in
any
dishonest
act
can
no
longer
live
among
them
he
is
universally
shunned
and
shame
becomes
the
severest
punishment
such
a
contempt
have
they
in
fact
for
every
species
of
fraud
that
they
will
not
allow
the
people
on
the
western
coast
to
be
their
countrymen
so
much
do
they
despise
the
arts
for
which
those
traders
who
live
on
the
rocks
are
notorious
the
description
i
received
of
them
carried
me
back
to
the
fables
of
the
golden
age
independence
and
virtue
affluence
without
vice
cultivation
of
mind
without
depravity
of
heart
with
ever
smiling
liberty
the
nymph
of
the
mountain
i
want
faith
my
imagination
hurries
me
forward
to
seek
an
asylum
in
such
a
retreat
from
all
the
disappointments
i
am
threatened
with
but
reason
drags
me
back
whispering
that
the
world
is
still
the
world
and
man
the
same
compound
of
weakness
and
folly
who
must
occasionally
excite
love
and
disgust
admiration
and
contempt
but
this
description
though
it
seems
to
have
been
sketched
by
a
fairy
pencil
was
given
me
by
a
man
of
sound
understanding
whose
fancy
seldom
appears
to
run
away
with
him
a
law
in
norway
termed
the
has
lately
been
modified
and
probably
will
be
abolished
as
an
impediment
to
commerce
the
heir
of
an
estate
had
the
power
of
it
at
the
original
purchase
money
making
allowance
for
such
improvements
as
were
absolutely
necessary
during
the
space
of
twenty
years
at
present
ten
is
the
term
allowed
for
afterthought
and
when
the
regulation
was
made
all
the
men
of
abilities
were
invited
to
give
their
opinion
whether
it
were
better
to
abrogate
or
modify
it
it
is
certainly
a
convenient
and
safe
way
of
mortgaging
land
yet
the
most
rational
men
whom
i
conversed
with
on
the
subject
seemed
convinced
that
the
right
was
more
injurious
than
beneficial
to
society
still
if
it
contribute
to
keep
the
farms
in
the
farmers
own
hands
i
should
be
sorry
to
hear
that
it
were
abolished
the
aristocracy
in
norway
if
we
keep
clear
of
christiania
is
far
from
being
formidable
and
it
will
require
a
long
the
to
enable
the
merchants
to
attain
a
sufficient
moneyed
interest
to
induce
them
to
reinforce
the
upper
class
at
the
expense
of
the
yeomanry
with
whom
they
are
usually
connected
england
and
america
owe
their
liberty
to
commerce
which
created
new
species
of
power
to
undermine
the
feudal
system
but
let
them
beware
of
the
consequence
the
tyranny
of
wealth
is
still
more
galling
and
debasing
than
that
of
rank
farewell
i
must
prepare
for
my
departure
letter
xv
i
left
christiania
yesterday
the
weather
was
not
very
fine
and
having
been
a
little
delayed
on
the
road
i
found
that
it
was
too
late
to
go
round
a
couple
of
miles
to
see
the
cascade
near
fredericstadt
which
i
had
determined
to
visit
besides
as
fredericstadt
is
a
fortress
it
was
necessary
to
arrive
there
before
they
shut
the
gate
the
road
along
the
river
is
very
romantic
though
the
views
are
not
grand
and
the
riches
of
norway
its
timber
floats
silently
down
the
stream
often
impeded
in
its
course
by
islands
and
little
cataracts
the
offspring
as
it
were
of
the
great
one
i
had
frequently
heard
described
i
found
an
excellent
inn
at
fredericstadt
and
was
gratified
by
the
kind
attention
of
the
hostess
who
perceiving
that
my
clothes
were
wet
took
great
pains
procure
me
as
a
stranger
every
comfort
for
the
night
it
had
rained
very
hard
and
we
passed
the
ferry
in
the
dark
without
getting
out
of
our
carriage
which
i
think
wrong
as
the
horses
are
sometimes
unruly
fatigue
and
melancholy
however
had
made
me
regardless
whether
i
went
down
or
across
the
stream
and
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
wet
before
the
hostess
marked
it
my
imagination
has
never
yet
severed
me
from
my
griefs
and
my
mind
has
seldom
been
so
free
as
to
allow
my
body
to
be
delicate
how
i
am
altered
by
disappointment
when
going
to
lisbon
the
elasticity
of
my
mind
was
sufficient
to
ward
off
weariness
and
my
imagination
still
could
dip
her
brush
in
the
rainbow
of
fancy
and
sketch
futurity
in
glowing
colours
now
but
let
me
talk
of
something
else
will
you
go
with
me
to
the
cascade
the
cross
road
to
it
was
rugged
and
dreary
and
though
a
considerable
extent
of
land
was
cultivated
on
all
sides
yet
the
rocks
were
entirely
bare
which
surprised
me
as
they
were
more
on
a
level
with
the
surface
than
any
i
had
yet
seen
on
inquiry
however
i
learnt
that
some
years
since
a
forest
had
been
burnt
this
appearance
of
desolation
was
beyond
measure
gloomy
inspiring
emotions
that
sterility
had
never
produced
fires
of
this
kind
are
occasioned
by
the
wind
suddenly
rising
when
the
farmers
are
burning
roots
of
trees
stalks
of
beans
c
with
which
they
manure
the
ground
the
devastation
must
indeed
be
terrible
when
this
literally
speaking
wildfire
runs
along
the
forest
flying
from
top
to
top
and
crackling
amongst
the
branches
the
soil
as
well
as
the
trees
is
swept
away
by
the
destructive
torrent
and
the
country
despoiled
of
beauty
and
riches
is
left
to
mourn
for
ages
admiring
as
i
do
these
noble
forests
which
seem
to
bid
defiance
to
time
i
looked
with
pain
on
the
ridge
of
rocks
that
stretched
far
beyond
my
eye
formerly
crowned
with
the
most
beautiful
verdure
i
have
often
mentioned
the
grandeur
but
i
feel
myself
unequal
to
the
task
of
conveying
an
idea
of
the
beauty
and
elegance
of
the
scene
when
the
spiry
tops
of
the
pines
are
loaded
with
ripening
seed
and
the
sun
gives
a
glow
to
their
tinge
which
is
changing
into
purple
one
tree
more
or
less
advanced
contrasted
with
another
the
profusion
with
which
nature
has
decked
them
with
pendant
honours
prevents
all
surprise
at
seeing
in
every
crevice
some
sapling
struggling
for
existence
vast
masses
of
stone
are
thus
encircled
and
roots
torn
up
by
the
storms
become
a
shelter
for
a
young
generation
the
pine
and
fir
woods
left
entirely
to
nature
display
an
endless
variety
and
the
paths
in
the
woods
are
not
entangled
with
fallen
leaves
which
are
only
interesting
whilst
they
are
fluttering
between
life
and
death
the
grey
appearance
of
the
aged
pines
is
a
much
finer
image
of
decay
the
fibres
whitening
as
they
lose
their
moisture
imprisoned
life
seems
to
be
stealing
away
i
can
not
tell
why
but
death
under
every
form
appears
to
me
like
something
getting
free
to
expand
in
i
know
not
what
element
nay
i
feel
that
this
conscious
being
must
be
as
unfettered
have
the
wings
of
thought
before
it
can
be
happy
reaching
the
cascade
or
rather
cataract
the
roaring
of
which
had
a
long
time
announced
its
vicinity
my
soul
was
hurried
by
the
falls
into
a
new
train
of
reflections
the
impetuous
dashing
of
the
rebounding
torrent
from
the
dark
cavities
which
mocked
the
exploring
eye
produced
an
equal
activity
in
my
mind
my
thoughts
darted
from
earth
to
heaven
and
i
asked
myself
why
i
was
chained
to
life
and
its
misery
still
the
tumultuous
emotions
this
sublime
object
excited
were
pleasurable
and
viewing
it
my
soul
rose
with
renewed
dignity
above
its
cares
grasping
at
immortality
it
seemed
as
impossible
to
stop
the
current
of
my
thoughts
as
of
the
always
varying
still
the
same
torrent
before
me
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
eternity
bounding
over
the
dark
speck
of
life
to
come
we
turned
with
regret
from
the
cascade
on
a
little
hill
which
commands
the
best
view
of
it
several
obelisks
are
erected
to
commemorate
the
visits
of
different
kings
the
appearance
of
the
river
above
and
below
the
falls
is
very
picturesque
the
ruggedness
of
the
scenery
disappearing
as
the
torrent
subsides
into
a
peaceful
stream
but
i
did
not
like
to
see
a
number
of
crowded
together
close
to
the
cataracts
they
destroyed
the
harmony
of
the
prospect
the
sight
of
a
bridge
erected
across
a
deep
valley
at
a
little
distance
inspired
very
dissimilar
sensations
it
was
most
ingeniously
supported
by
trunks
just
stripped
of
their
branches
and
logs
placed
one
across
the
other
produced
an
appearance
equally
light
and
firm
seeming
almost
to
be
built
in
the
air
when
we
were
below
it
the
height
taking
from
the
magnitude
of
the
supporting
trees
give
them
a
slender
graceful
look
there
are
two
noble
estates
in
this
neighbourhood
the
proprietors
of
which
seem
to
have
caught
more
than
their
portion
of
the
enterprising
spirit
that
is
gone
abroad
many
agricultural
experiments
have
been
made
and
the
country
appears
better
enclosed
and
cultivated
yet
the
cottages
had
not
the
comfortable
aspect
of
those
i
had
observed
near
moss
and
to
the
westward
man
is
always
debased
by
servitude
of
any
description
and
here
the
peasantry
are
not
entirely
free
adieu
i
almost
forgot
to
tell
you
that
i
did
not
leave
norway
without
making
some
inquiries
after
the
monsters
said
to
have
been
seen
in
the
northern
sea
but
though
i
conversed
with
several
captains
i
could
not
meet
with
one
who
had
ever
heard
any
traditional
description
of
them
much
less
had
any
ocular
demonstration
of
their
existence
till
the
fact
is
better
ascertained
i
should
think
the
account
of
them
ought
to
be
torn
out
of
our
geographical
grammars
letter
xvi
i
set
out
from
fredericstadt
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
expected
to
reach
stromstad
before
the
night
closed
in
but
the
wind
dying
away
the
weather
became
so
calm
that
we
scarcely
made
any
perceptible
advances
towards
the
opposite
coast
though
the
men
were
fatigued
with
rowing
getting
amongst
the
rocks
and
islands
as
the
moon
rose
and
the
stars
darted
forward
out
of
the
clear
expanse
i
forgot
that
the
night
stole
on
whilst
indulging
affectionate
reveries
the
poetical
fictions
of
sensibility
i
was
not
therefore
aware
of
the
length
of
time
we
had
been
toiling
to
reach
stromstad
and
when
i
began
to
look
around
i
did
not
perceive
anything
to
indicate
that
we
were
in
its
neighbourhood
so
far
from
it
that
when
i
inquired
of
the
pilot
who
spoke
a
little
english
i
found
that
he
was
only
accustomed
to
coast
along
the
norwegian
shore
and
had
been
only
once
across
to
stromstad
but
he
had
brought
with
him
a
fellow
better
acquainted
he
assured
me
with
the
rocks
by
which
they
were
to
steer
our
course
for
we
had
not
a
compass
on
board
yet
as
he
was
half
a
fool
i
had
little
confidence
in
his
skill
there
was
then
great
reason
to
fear
that
we
had
lost
our
way
and
were
straying
amidst
a
labyrinth
of
rocks
without
a
clue
this
was
something
like
an
adventure
but
not
of
the
most
agreeable
cast
besides
i
was
impatient
to
arrive
at
stromstad
to
be
able
to
send
forward
that
night
a
boy
to
order
horses
on
the
road
to
be
ready
for
i
was
unwilling
to
remain
there
a
day
without
having
anything
to
detain
me
from
my
little
girl
and
from
the
letters
which
i
was
impatient
to
get
from
you
i
began
to
expostulate
and
even
to
scold
the
pilot
for
not
having
informed
me
of
his
ignorance
previous
to
my
departure
this
made
him
row
with
more
force
and
we
turned
round
one
rock
only
to
see
another
equally
destitute
of
the
tokens
we
were
in
search
of
to
tell
us
where
we
were
entering
also
into
creek
after
creek
which
promised
to
be
the
entrance
of
the
bay
we
were
seeking
we
advanced
merely
to
find
ourselves
running
aground
the
solitariness
of
the
scene
as
we
glided
under
the
dark
shadows
of
the
rocks
pleased
me
for
a
while
but
the
fear
of
passing
the
whole
night
thus
wandering
to
and
fro
and
losing
the
next
day
roused
me
i
begged
the
pilot
to
return
to
one
of
the
largest
islands
at
the
side
of
which
we
had
seen
a
boat
moored
as
we
drew
nearer
a
light
through
a
window
on
the
summit
became
our
beacon
but
we
were
farther
off
than
i
supposed
with
some
difficulty
the
pilot
got
on
shore
not
distinguishing
the
and
i
remained
in
the
boat
knowing
that
all
the
relief
we
could
expect
was
a
man
to
direct
us
after
waiting
some
time
for
there
is
an
insensibility
in
the
very
movements
of
these
people
that
would
weary
more
than
ordinary
patience
he
brought
with
him
a
man
who
assisting
them
to
row
we
landed
at
stromstad
a
little
after
one
in
the
morning
it
was
too
late
to
send
off
a
boy
but
i
did
not
go
to
bed
before
i
had
made
the
arrangements
necessary
to
enable
me
to
set
out
as
early
as
possible
the
sun
rose
with
splendour
my
mind
was
too
active
to
allow
me
to
loiter
long
in
bed
though
the
horses
did
not
arrive
till
between
seven
and
eight
however
as
i
wished
to
let
the
boy
who
went
forward
to
order
the
horses
get
considerably
the
start
of
me
i
bridled
in
my
impatience
this
precaution
was
unavailing
for
after
the
three
first
posts
i
had
to
wait
two
hours
whilst
the
people
at
the
went
fair
and
softly
to
the
farm
to
bid
them
bring
up
the
horses
which
were
carrying
in
the
of
the
harvest
i
discovered
here
that
these
sluggish
peasants
had
their
share
of
cunning
though
they
had
made
me
pay
for
a
horse
the
boy
had
gone
on
foot
and
only
arrived
half
an
hour
before
me
this
disconcerted
the
whole
arrangement
of
the
day
and
being
detained
again
three
hours
i
reluctantly
determined
to
sleep
at
quistram
two
posts
short
of
uddervalla
where
i
had
hoped
to
have
arrived
that
night
but
when
i
reached
quistram
i
found
i
could
not
approach
the
door
of
the
inn
for
men
horses
and
carts
cows
and
pigs
huddled
together
from
the
concourse
of
people
i
had
met
on
the
road
i
conjectured
that
there
was
a
fair
in
the
neighbourhood
this
crowd
convinced
me
that
it
was
but
too
true
the
boisterous
merriment
that
almost
every
instant
produced
a
quarrel
or
made
me
dread
one
with
the
clouds
of
tobacco
and
fumes
of
brandy
gave
an
infernal
appearance
to
the
scene
there
was
everything
to
drive
me
back
nothing
to
excite
sympathy
in
a
rude
tumult
of
the
senses
which
i
foresaw
would
end
in
a
gross
debauch
what
was
to
be
done
no
bed
was
to
be
had
or
even
a
quiet
corner
to
retire
to
for
a
moment
all
was
lost
in
noise
riot
and
confusion
after
some
debating
they
promised
me
horses
which
were
to
go
on
to
uddervalla
two
stages
i
requested
something
to
eat
first
not
having
dined
and
the
hostess
whom
i
have
mentioned
to
you
before
as
knowing
how
to
take
care
of
herself
brought
me
a
plate
of
fish
for
which
she
charged
a
and
a
half
this
was
making
hay
whilst
the
sun
shone
i
was
glad
to
get
out
of
the
uproar
though
not
disposed
to
travel
in
an
incommodious
open
carriage
all
night
had
i
thought
that
there
was
any
chance
of
getting
horses
quitting
quistram
i
met
a
number
of
joyous
groups
and
though
the
evening
was
fresh
many
were
stretched
on
the
grass
like
weary
cattle
and
drunken
men
had
fallen
by
the
on
a
rock
under
the
shade
of
lofty
trees
a
large
party
of
men
and
women
had
lighted
a
fire
cutting
down
fuel
around
to
keep
it
alive
all
night
they
were
drinking
smoking
and
laughing
with
all
their
might
and
main
i
felt
for
the
trees
whose
torn
branches
strewed
the
ground
hapless
nymphs
your
haunts
i
fear
were
polluted
by
many
an
unhallowed
flame
the
casual
burst
of
the
moment
the
horses
went
on
very
well
but
when
we
drew
near
the
the
postillion
stopped
short
and
neither
threats
nor
promises
could
prevail
on
him
to
go
forward
he
even
began
to
howl
and
weep
when
i
insisted
on
his
keeping
his
word
nothing
indeed
can
equal
the
stupid
obstinacy
of
some
of
these
beings
who
seem
to
have
been
made
by
prometheus
when
the
fire
he
stole
from
heaven
was
so
exhausted
that
he
could
only
spare
a
spark
to
give
life
not
animation
to
the
inert
clay
it
was
some
time
before
we
could
rouse
anybody
and
as
i
expected
horses
we
were
told
could
not
be
had
in
less
than
four
or
five
hours
i
again
attempted
to
bribe
the
churlish
brute
who
brought
us
there
but
i
discovered
that
in
spite
of
the
courteous
hostess
promises
he
had
received
orders
not
to
go
any
father
as
there
was
no
remedy
i
entered
and
was
almost
driven
back
by
the
stench
a
softer
phrase
would
not
have
conveyed
an
idea
of
the
hot
vapour
that
issued
from
an
apartment
in
which
some
eight
or
ten
people
were
sleeping
not
to
reckon
the
cats
and
dogs
stretched
on
the
floor
two
or
three
of
the
men
or
women
were
on
the
benches
others
on
old
chests
and
one
figure
started
half
out
of
a
trunk
to
look
at
me
whom
might
have
taken
for
a
ghost
had
the
chemise
been
white
to
contrast
with
the
sallow
visage
but
the
costume
of
apparitions
not
being
preserved
i
passed
nothing
dreading
excepting
the
effluvia
warily
amongst
the
pots
pans
and
after
scaling
a
ruinous
staircase
i
was
shown
a
the
bed
did
not
invite
me
to
enter
opening
therefore
the
window
and
taking
some
clean
towels
out
of
my
i
spread
them
over
the
coverlid
on
which
tired
nature
found
repose
in
spite
of
the
previous
disgust
with
the
grey
of
the
morn
the
birds
awoke
me
and
descending
to
inquire
for
the
horses
i
hastened
through
the
apartment
i
have
already
described
not
wishing
to
associate
the
idea
of
a
pigstye
with
that
of
a
human
dwelling
i
do
not
now
wonder
that
the
girls
lose
their
fine
complexions
at
such
an
early
age
or
that
love
here
is
merely
an
appetite
to
fulfil
the
main
design
of
nature
never
enlivened
by
either
affection
or
sentiment
for
a
few
posts
we
found
the
horses
waiting
but
afterwards
i
was
retarded
as
before
by
the
peasants
who
taking
advantage
of
my
ignorance
of
the
language
made
me
pay
for
the
fourth
horse
that
ought
to
have
gone
forward
to
have
the
others
in
readiness
though
it
had
never
been
sent
i
was
particularly
impatient
at
the
last
post
as
i
longed
to
assure
myself
that
my
child
was
well
my
impatience
however
did
not
prevent
my
enjoying
the
journey
i
had
six
weeks
before
passed
over
the
same
ground
still
it
had
sufficient
novelty
to
attract
my
attention
and
beguile
if
not
banish
the
sorrow
that
had
taken
up
its
abode
in
my
heart
how
interesting
are
the
varied
beauties
of
nature
and
what
peculiar
charms
characterise
each
season
the
purple
hue
which
the
heath
now
assumed
gave
it
a
degree
of
richness
that
almost
exceeded
the
lustre
of
the
young
green
of
spring
and
harmonised
exquisitely
with
the
rays
of
the
ripening
corn
the
weather
was
uninterruptedly
fine
and
the
people
busy
in
the
fields
cutting
down
the
corn
or
binding
up
the
sheaves
continually
varied
the
prospect
the
rocks
it
is
true
were
unusually
rugged
and
dreary
yet
as
the
road
runs
for
a
considerable
way
by
the
side
of
a
fine
river
with
extended
pastures
on
the
other
side
the
image
of
sterility
was
not
the
predominant
object
though
the
cottages
looked
still
more
miserable
after
having
seen
the
norwegian
farms
the
trees
likewise
appeared
of
me
growth
of
yesterday
compared
with
those
nestors
of
the
forest
i
have
frequently
mentioned
the
women
and
children
were
cutting
off
branches
from
the
beech
birch
oak
c
and
leaving
them
to
dry
this
way
of
helping
out
their
fodder
injures
the
trees
but
the
winters
are
so
long
that
the
poor
can
not
afford
to
lay
in
a
sufficient
stock
of
hay
by
such
means
they
just
keep
life
in
the
poor
cows
for
little
milk
can
be
expected
when
they
are
so
miserably
fed
it
was
saturday
and
the
evening
was
uncommonly
serene
in
the
villages
i
everywhere
saw
preparations
for
sunday
and
i
passed
by
a
little
car
loaded
with
rye
that
presented
for
the
pencil
and
heart
the
sweetest
picture
of
a
harvest
home
i
had
ever
beheld
a
little
girl
was
mounted
straddle
on
a
shaggy
horse
brandishing
a
stick
over
its
head
the
father
was
walking
at
the
side
of
the
car
with
a
child
in
his
arms
who
must
have
come
to
meet
him
with
tottering
steps
the
little
creature
was
stretching
out
its
arms
to
cling
round
his
neck
and
a
boy
just
above
petticoats
was
labouring
hard
with
a
fork
behind
to
keep
the
sheaves
from
falling
my
eyes
followed
them
to
the
cottage
and
an
involuntary
sigh
whispered
to
my
heart
that
i
envied
the
mother
much
as
i
dislike
cooking
who
was
preparing
their
pottage
i
was
returning
to
my
babe
who
may
never
experience
a
father
care
or
tenderness
the
bosom
that
nurtured
her
heaved
with
a
pang
at
the
thought
which
only
an
unhappy
mother
could
feel
adieu
letter
xvii
i
was
unwilling
to
leave
gothenburg
without
visiting
trolhaettae
i
wished
not
only
to
see
the
cascade
but
to
observe
the
progress
of
the
stupendous
attempt
to
form
a
canal
through
the
rocks
to
the
extent
of
an
english
mile
and
a
half
this
work
is
carried
on
by
a
company
who
employ
daily
nine
hundred
men
five
years
was
the
time
mentioned
in
the
proposals
addressed
to
the
public
as
necessary
for
the
completion
a
much
more
considerable
sum
than
the
plan
requires
has
been
subscribed
for
which
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
the
promoters
will
receive
ample
interest
the
danes
survey
the
progress
of
this
work
with
a
jealous
eye
as
it
is
principally
undertaken
to
get
clear
of
the
sound
duty
arrived
at
trolhaettae
i
must
own
that
the
first
view
of
the
cascade
disappointed
me
and
the
sight
of
the
works
as
they
advanced
though
a
grand
proof
of
human
industry
was
not
calculated
to
warm
the
fancy
i
however
wandered
about
and
at
last
coming
to
the
conflux
of
the
various
cataracts
rushing
from
different
falls
struggling
with
the
huge
masses
of
rock
and
rebounding
from
the
profound
cavities
i
immediately
retracted
acknowledging
that
it
was
indeed
a
grand
object
a
little
island
stood
in
the
midst
covered
with
firs
which
by
dividing
the
torrent
rendered
it
more
picturesque
one
half
appearing
to
issue
from
a
dark
cavern
that
fancy
might
easily
imagine
a
vast
fountain
throwing
up
its
waters
from
the
very
centre
of
the
earth
i
gazed
i
know
not
how
long
stunned
with
the
noise
and
growing
giddy
with
only
looking
at
the
tumultuous
motion
i
listened
scarcely
conscious
where
i
was
when
i
observed
a
boy
half
obscured
by
the
sparkling
foam
fishing
under
the
impending
rock
on
the
other
side
how
he
had
descended
i
could
not
perceive
nothing
like
human
footsteps
appeared
and
the
horrific
crags
seemed
to
bid
defiance
even
to
the
goat
activity
it
looked
like
an
abode
only
fit
for
the
eagle
though
in
its
crevices
some
pines
darted
up
their
spiral
heads
but
they
only
grew
near
the
cascade
everywhere
else
sterility
itself
reigned
with
dreary
grandeur
for
the
huge
grey
massy
rocks
which
probably
had
been
torn
asunder
by
some
dreadful
convulsion
of
nature
had
not
even
their
first
covering
of
a
little
cleaving
moss
there
were
so
many
appearances
to
excite
the
idea
of
chaos
that
instead
of
admiring
the
canal
and
the
works
great
as
they
are
termed
and
little
as
they
appear
i
could
not
help
regretting
that
such
a
noble
scene
had
not
been
left
in
all
its
solitary
sublimity
amidst
the
awful
roaring
of
the
impetuous
torrents
the
noise
of
human
instruments
and
the
bustle
of
workmen
even
the
blowing
up
of
the
rocks
when
grand
masses
trembled
in
the
darkened
air
only
resembled
the
insignificant
sport
of
children
one
fall
of
water
partly
made
by
art
when
they
were
attempting
to
construct
sluices
had
an
uncommonly
grand
effect
the
water
precipitated
itself
with
immense
velocity
down
a
perpendicular
at
least
fifty
or
sixty
yards
into
a
gulf
so
concealed
by
the
foam
as
to
give
full
play
to
the
fancy
there
was
a
continual
uproar
i
stood
on
a
rock
to
observe
it
a
kind
of
bridge
formed
by
nature
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
commencement
of
the
fall
after
musing
by
it
a
long
time
i
turned
towards
the
other
side
and
saw
a
gentle
stream
stray
calmly
out
i
should
have
concluded
that
it
had
no
communication
with
the
torrent
had
i
not
seen
a
huge
log
that
fell
headlong
down
the
cascade
steal
peacefully
into
the
purling
stream
i
retired
from
these
wild
scenes
with
regret
to
a
miserable
inn
and
next
morning
returned
to
gothenburg
to
prepare
for
my
journey
to
copenhagen
i
was
sorry
to
leave
gothenburg
without
travelling
farther
into
sweden
yet
i
imagine
i
should
only
have
seen
a
romantic
country
thinly
inhabited
and
these
inhabitants
struggling
with
poverty
the
norwegian
peasantry
mostly
independent
have
a
rough
kind
of
frankness
in
their
manner
but
the
swedish
rendered
more
abject
by
misery
have
a
degree
of
politeness
in
their
address
which
though
it
may
sometimes
border
on
insincerity
is
oftener
the
effect
of
a
broken
spirit
rather
softened
than
degraded
by
wretchedness
in
norway
there
are
no
notes
in
circulation
of
less
value
than
a
swedish
a
small
silver
coin
commonly
not
worth
more
than
a
penny
and
never
more
than
twopence
serves
for
change
but
in
sweden
they
have
notes
as
low
as
sixpence
i
never
saw
any
silver
pieces
there
and
could
not
without
difficulty
and
giving
a
premium
obtain
the
value
of
a
dollar
in
a
large
copper
coin
to
give
away
on
the
road
to
the
poor
who
open
the
gates
as
another
proof
of
the
poverty
of
sweden
i
ought
to
mention
that
foreign
merchants
who
have
acquired
a
fortune
there
are
obliged
to
deposit
the
sixth
part
when
they
leave
the
kingdom
this
law
you
may
suppose
is
frequently
evaded
in
fact
the
laws
here
as
well
as
in
norway
are
so
relaxed
that
they
rather
favour
than
restrain
knavery
whilst
i
was
at
gothenburg
a
man
who
had
been
confined
for
breaking
open
his
master
desk
and
running
away
with
five
or
six
thousand
was
only
sentenced
to
forty
days
confinement
on
bread
and
water
and
this
slight
punishment
his
relations
rendered
nugatory
by
supplying
him
with
more
savoury
food
the
swedes
are
in
general
attached
to
their
families
yet
a
divorce
may
be
obtained
by
either
party
on
proving
the
infidelity
of
the
other
or
acknowledging
it
themselves
the
women
do
not
often
recur
to
this
equal
privilege
for
they
either
retaliate
on
their
husbands
by
following
their
own
devices
or
sink
into
the
merest
domestic
drudges
worn
down
by
tyranny
to
servile
submission
do
not
term
me
severe
if
i
add
that
after
youth
is
flown
the
husband
becomes
a
sot
and
the
wife
amuses
herself
by
scolding
her
servants
in
fact
what
is
to
be
expected
in
any
country
where
taste
and
cultivation
of
mind
do
not
supply
the
place
of
youthful
beauty
and
animal
spirits
affection
requires
a
firmer
foundation
than
sympathy
and
few
people
have
a
principle
of
action
sufficiently
stable
to
produce
rectitude
of
feeling
for
in
spite
of
all
the
arguments
i
have
heard
to
justify
deviations
from
duty
i
am
persuaded
that
even
the
most
spontaneous
sensations
are
more
under
the
direction
of
principle
than
weak
people
are
willing
to
allow
but
adieu
to
moralising
i
have
been
writing
these
last
sheets
at
an
inn
in
elsineur
where
i
am
waiting
for
horses
and
as
they
are
not
yet
ready
i
will
give
you
a
short
account
of
my
journey
from
gothenburg
for
i
set
out
the
morning
after
i
returned
from
trolhaettae
the
country
during
the
first
day
journey
presented
a
most
barren
appearance
as
rocky
yet
not
so
picturesque
as
norway
because
on
a
diminutive
scale
we
stopped
to
sleep
at
a
tolerable
inn
in
falckersberg
a
decent
little
town
the
next
day
beeches
and
oaks
began
to
grace
the
prospects
the
sea
every
now
and
then
appearing
to
give
them
dignity
i
could
not
avoid
observing
also
that
even
in
this
part
of
sweden
one
of
the
most
sterile
as
i
was
informed
there
was
more
ground
under
cultivation
than
in
norway
plains
of
varied
crops
stretched
out
to
a
considerable
extent
and
sloped
down
to
the
shore
no
longer
terrific
and
as
far
as
i
could
judge
from
glancing
my
eye
over
the
country
as
we
drove
along
agriculture
was
in
a
more
advanced
state
though
in
the
habitations
a
greater
appearance
of
poverty
still
remained
the
cottages
indeed
often
looked
most
uncomfortable
but
never
so
miserable
as
those
i
had
remarked
on
the
road
to
stromstad
and
the
towns
were
equal
if
not
superior
to
many
of
the
little
towns
in
wales
or
some
i
have
passed
through
in
my
way
from
calais
to
paris
the
inns
as
we
advanced
were
not
to
be
complained
of
unless
i
had
always
thought
of
england
the
people
were
civil
and
much
more
moderate
in
their
demands
than
the
norwegians
particularly
to
the
westward
where
they
boldly
charge
for
what
you
never
had
and
seem
to
consider
you
as
they
do
a
wreck
if
not
as
lawful
prey
yet
as
a
lucky
chance
which
they
ought
not
to
neglect
to
seize
the
prospect
of
elsineur
as
we
passed
the
sound
was
pleasant
i
gave
three
for
my
boat
including
something
to
drink
i
mention
the
sum
because
they
impose
on
strangers
adieu
till
i
arrive
at
copenhagen
letter
copenhagen
the
distance
from
elsineur
to
copenhagen
is
miles
the
road
is
very
good
over
a
flat
country
diversified
with
wood
mostly
beech
and
decent
mansions
there
appeared
to
be
a
great
quantity
of
corn
land
and
the
soil
looked
much
more
fertile
than
it
is
in
general
so
near
the
sea
the
rising
grounds
indeed
were
very
few
and
around
copenhagen
it
is
a
perfect
plain
of
course
has
nothing
to
recommend
it
but
cultivation
not
decorations
if
i
say
that
the
houses
did
not
disgust
me
i
tell
you
all
i
remember
of
them
for
i
can
not
recollect
any
pleasurable
sensations
they
excited
or
that
any
object
produced
by
nature
or
art
took
me
out
of
myself
the
view
of
the
city
as
we
drew
near
was
rather
grand
but
without
any
striking
feature
to
interest
the
imagination
excepting
the
trees
which
shade
the
footpaths
just
before
i
reached
copenhagen
i
saw
a
number
of
tents
on
a
wide
plain
and
supposed
that
the
rage
for
encampments
had
reached
this
city
but
i
soon
discovered
that
they
were
the
asylum
of
many
of
the
poor
families
who
had
been
driven
out
of
their
habitations
by
the
late
fire
entering
soon
after
i
passed
amongst
the
dust
and
rubbish
it
had
left
affrighted
by
viewing
the
extent
of
the
devastation
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
the
city
had
been
destroyed
there
was
little
in
the
appearance
of
fallen
bricks
and
stacks
of
chimneys
to
allure
the
imagination
into
soothing
melancholy
reveries
nothing
to
attract
the
eye
of
taste
but
much
to
afflict
the
benevolent
heart
the
depredations
of
time
have
always
something
in
them
to
employ
the
fancy
or
lead
to
musing
on
subjects
which
withdrawing
the
mind
from
objects
of
sense
seem
to
give
it
new
dignity
but
here
i
was
treading
on
live
ashes
the
sufferers
were
still
under
the
pressure
of
the
misery
occasioned
by
this
dreadful
conflagration
i
could
not
take
refuge
in
the
thought
they
suffered
but
they
are
no
more
a
reflection
i
frequently
summon
to
calm
my
mind
when
sympathy
rises
to
anguish
i
therefore
desired
the
driver
to
hasten
to
the
hotel
recommended
to
me
that
i
might
avert
my
eyes
and
snap
the
train
of
thinking
which
had
sent
me
into
all
the
corners
of
the
city
in
search
of
houseless
heads
this
morning
i
have
been
walking
round
the
town
till
i
am
weary
of
observing
the
ravages
i
had
often
heard
the
danes
even
those
who
had
seen
paris
and
london
speak
of
copenhagen
with
rapture
certainly
i
have
seen
it
in
a
very
disadvantageous
light
some
of
the
best
streets
having
been
burnt
and
the
whole
place
thrown
into
confusion
still
the
utmost
that
can
or
could
ever
i
believe
have
been
said
in
its
praise
might
be
comprised
in
a
few
words
the
streets
are
open
and
many
of
the
houses
large
but
i
saw
nothing
to
rouse
the
idea
of
elegance
or
grandeur
if
i
except
the
circus
where
the
king
and
prince
royal
reside
the
palace
which
was
consumed
about
two
years
ago
must
have
been
a
handsome
spacious
building
the
is
still
standing
and
a
great
number
of
the
poor
during
the
late
fire
took
refuge
in
its
ruins
till
they
could
find
some
other
abode
beds
were
thrown
on
the
places
of
the
grand
staircase
where
whole
families
crept
from
the
cold
and
every
little
nook
is
boarded
up
as
a
retreat
for
some
poor
creatures
deprived
of
their
home
at
present
a
roof
may
be
sufficient
to
shelter
them
from
the
night
air
but
as
the
season
advances
the
extent
of
the
calamity
will
be
more
severely
felt
i
fear
though
the
exertions
on
the
part
of
government
are
very
considerable
private
charity
has
also
no
doubt
done
much
to
alleviate
the
misery
which
obtrudes
itself
at
every
turn
still
public
spirit
appears
to
me
to
be
hardly
alive
here
had
it
existed
the
conflagration
might
have
been
smothered
in
the
beginning
as
it
was
at
last
by
tearing
down
several
houses
before
the
flames
had
reached
them
to
this
the
inhabitants
would
not
consent
and
the
prince
royal
not
having
sufficient
energy
of
character
to
know
when
he
ought
to
be
absolute
calmly
let
them
pursue
their
own
course
till
the
whole
city
seemed
to
be
threatened
with
destruction
adhering
with
puerile
scrupulosity
to
the
law
which
he
has
imposed
on
himself
of
acting
exactly
right
he
did
wrong
by
idly
lamenting
whilst
he
marked
the
progress
of
a
mischief
that
one
decided
step
would
have
stopped
he
was
afterwards
obliged
to
resort
to
violent
measures
but
then
who
could
blame
him
and
to
avoid
censure
what
sacrifices
are
not
made
by
weak
minds
a
gentleman
who
was
a
witness
of
the
scene
assured
me
likewise
that
if
the
people
of
property
had
taken
half
as
much
pains
to
extinguish
the
fire
as
to
preserve
their
valuables
and
furniture
it
would
soon
have
been
got
under
but
they
who
were
not
immediately
in
danger
did
not
exert
themselves
sufficiently
till
fear
like
an
electrical
shock
roused
all
the
inhabitants
to
a
sense
of
the
general
evil
even
the
engines
were
out
of
order
though
the
burning
of
the
palace
ought
to
have
admonished
them
of
the
necessity
of
keeping
them
in
constant
repair
but
this
kind
of
indolence
respecting
what
does
not
immediately
concern
them
seems
to
characterise
the
danes
a
sluggish
concentration
in
themselves
makes
them
so
careful
to
preserve
their
property
that
they
will
not
venture
on
any
enterprise
to
increase
it
in
which
there
is
a
shadow
of
hazard
considering
copenhagen
as
the
capital
of
denmark
and
norway
i
was
surprised
not
to
see
so
much
industry
or
taste
as
in
christiania
indeed
from
everything
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
danes
are
the
people
who
have
made
the
fewest
sacrifices
to
the
graces
the
men
of
business
are
domestic
tyrants
coldly
immersed
in
their
own
affairs
and
so
ignorant
of
the
state
of
other
countries
that
they
dogmatically
assert
that
denmark
is
the
happiest
country
in
the
world
the
prince
royal
the
best
of
all
possible
princes
and
count
bernstorff
the
wisest
of
ministers
as
for
the
women
they
are
simply
notable
housewives
without
accomplishments
or
any
of
the
charms
that
adorn
more
advanced
social
life
this
total
ignorance
may
enable
them
to
save
something
in
their
kitchens
but
it
is
far
from
rendering
them
better
parents
on
the
contrary
the
children
are
spoiled
as
they
usually
are
when
left
to
the
care
of
weak
indulgent
mothers
who
having
no
principle
of
action
to
regulate
their
feelings
become
the
slaves
of
infants
enfeebling
both
body
and
mind
by
false
tenderness
i
am
perhaps
a
little
prejudiced
as
i
write
from
the
impression
of
the
moment
for
i
have
been
tormented
by
the
presence
of
unruly
children
and
made
angry
by
some
invectives
thrown
out
against
the
maternal
character
of
the
unfortunate
matilda
she
was
censured
with
the
most
cruel
insinuation
for
her
management
of
her
son
though
from
what
i
could
gather
she
gave
proofs
of
good
sense
as
well
as
tenderness
in
her
attention
to
him
she
used
to
bathe
him
herself
every
morning
insisted
on
his
being
loosely
clad
and
would
not
permit
his
attendants
to
injure
his
digestion
by
humouring
his
appetite
she
was
equally
careful
to
prevent
his
acquiring
haughty
airs
and
playing
the
tyrant
in
the
queen
dowager
would
not
permit
her
to
suckle
him
but
the
next
child
being
a
daughter
and
not
the
of
the
crown
less
opposition
was
made
to
her
discharging
the
duty
of
a
mother
poor
matilda
thou
hast
haunted
me
ever
since
may
arrival
and
the
view
i
have
had
of
the
manners
of
the
country
exciting
my
sympathy
has
increased
my
respect
for
thy
memory
i
am
now
fully
convinced
that
she
was
the
victim
of
the
party
she
displaced
who
would
have
overlooked
or
encouraged
her
attachment
had
not
her
lover
aiming
at
being
useful
attempted
to
overturn
some
established
abuses
before
the
people
ripe
for
the
change
had
sufficient
spirit
to
support
him
when
struggling
in
their
behalf
such
indeed
was
the
asperity
sharpened
against
her
that
i
have
heard
her
even
after
so
many
years
have
elapsed
charged
with
licentiousness
not
only
for
endeavouring
to
render
the
public
amusements
more
elegant
but
for
her
very
charities
because
she
erected
amongst
other
institutions
a
hospital
to
receive
foundlings
disgusted
with
many
customs
which
pass
for
virtues
though
they
are
nothing
more
than
observances
of
forms
often
at
the
expense
of
truth
she
probably
ran
into
an
error
common
to
innovators
in
wishing
to
do
immediately
what
can
only
be
done
by
time
many
very
cogent
reasons
have
been
urged
by
her
friends
to
prove
that
her
affection
for
struensee
was
never
carried
to
the
length
alleged
against
her
by
those
who
feared
her
influence
be
that
as
it
may
she
certainly
was
no
a
woman
of
gallantry
and
if
she
had
an
attachment
for
him
it
did
not
disgrace
her
heart
or
understanding
the
king
being
a
notorious
debauchee
and
an
idiot
into
the
bargain
as
the
king
conduct
had
always
been
directed
by
some
favourite
they
also
endeavoured
to
govern
him
from
a
principle
of
as
well
as
a
laudable
ambition
but
not
aware
of
the
prejudices
they
had
to
encounter
the
system
they
adopted
displayed
more
benevolence
of
heart
than
soundness
of
judgment
as
to
the
charge
still
believed
of
their
giving
the
king
drugs
to
injure
his
faculties
it
is
too
absurd
to
be
refuted
their
oppressors
had
better
have
accused
them
of
dabbling
in
the
black
art
for
the
potent
spell
still
keeps
his
wits
in
bondage
i
can
not
describe
to
you
the
effect
it
had
on
me
to
see
this
puppet
of
a
monarch
moved
by
the
strings
which
count
bernstorff
holds
fast
sit
with
vacant
eye
erect
receiving
the
homage
of
courtiers
who
mock
him
with
a
show
of
respect
he
is
in
fact
merely
a
machine
of
state
to
subscribe
the
name
of
a
king
to
the
acts
of
the
government
which
to
avoid
danger
have
no
value
unless
countersigned
by
the
prince
royal
for
he
is
allowed
to
be
absolutely
aim
idiot
excepting
that
now
and
then
an
observation
or
trick
escapes
him
which
looks
more
like
madness
than
imbecility
what
a
farce
is
life
this
effigy
of
majesty
is
allowed
to
burn
down
to
the
socket
whilst
the
hapless
matilda
was
hurried
into
an
untimely
grave
as
flies
to
wanton
boys
are
we
to
the
gods
they
kill
us
for
their
sport
adieu
letter
xix
business
having
obliged
me
to
go
a
few
miles
out
of
town
this
morning
i
was
surprised
at
meeting
a
crowd
of
people
of
every
description
and
inquiring
the
cause
of
a
servant
who
spoke
french
i
was
informed
that
a
man
had
been
executed
two
hours
before
and
the
body
afterwards
burnt
i
could
not
help
looking
with
horror
around
the
fields
lost
their
verdure
and
i
turned
with
disgust
from
the
women
who
were
returning
with
their
children
from
this
sight
what
a
spectacle
for
humanity
the
seeing
such
a
flock
of
idle
gazers
plunged
me
into
a
train
of
reflections
on
the
pernicious
effects
produced
by
false
notions
of
justice
and
i
am
persuaded
that
till
capital
punishments
are
entirely
abolished
executions
ought
to
have
every
appearance
of
horror
given
to
them
instead
of
being
as
they
are
now
a
scene
of
amusement
for
the
gaping
crowd
where
sympathy
is
quickly
effaced
by
curiosity
i
have
always
been
of
opinion
that
the
allowing
actors
to
die
in
the
presence
of
the
audience
has
an
immoral
tendency
but
trifling
when
compared
with
the
ferocity
acquired
by
viewing
the
reality
as
a
show
for
it
seems
to
me
that
in
all
countries
the
common
people
go
to
executions
to
see
how
the
poor
wretch
plays
his
part
rather
than
to
commiserate
his
fate
much
less
to
think
of
the
breach
of
morality
which
has
brought
him
to
such
a
deplorable
end
consequently
executions
far
from
being
useful
examples
to
the
survivors
have
i
am
persuaded
a
quite
contrary
effect
by
hardening
the
heart
they
ought
to
terrify
besides
the
fear
of
an
ignominious
death
i
believe
never
deferred
anyone
from
the
commission
of
a
crime
because
in
committing
it
the
mind
is
roused
to
activity
about
present
circumstances
it
is
a
game
at
hazard
at
which
all
expect
the
turn
of
the
die
in
their
own
favour
never
reflecting
on
the
chance
of
ruin
till
it
comes
in
fact
from
what
i
saw
in
the
fortresses
of
norway
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
the
same
energy
of
character
which
renders
a
man
a
daring
villain
would
have
rendered
him
useful
to
society
had
that
society
been
well
organised
when
a
strong
mind
is
not
disciplined
by
cultivation
it
is
a
sense
of
injustice
that
renders
it
unjust
executions
however
occur
very
rarely
at
copenhagen
for
timidity
rather
than
clemency
palsies
all
the
operations
of
the
present
government
the
malefactor
who
died
this
morning
would
not
probably
have
been
punished
with
death
at
any
other
period
but
an
incendiary
excites
universal
execration
and
as
the
greater
part
of
the
inhabitants
are
still
distressed
by
the
late
conflagration
an
example
was
thought
absolutely
necessary
though
from
what
i
can
gather
the
fire
was
accidental
not
but
that
i
have
very
seriously
been
informed
that
combustible
materials
were
placed
at
proper
distance
by
the
emissaries
of
pitt
and
to
corroborate
the
fact
many
people
insist
that
the
flames
burst
out
at
once
in
different
parts
of
the
city
not
allowing
the
wind
to
have
any
hand
in
it
so
much
for
the
plot
but
the
fabricators
of
plots
in
all
countries
build
their
conjectures
on
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
and
it
seems
even
a
sort
of
poetical
justice
that
whilst
this
minister
is
crushing
at
home
plots
of
his
own
conjuring
up
on
the
continent
and
in
the
north
he
should
with
as
little
foundation
be
accused
of
wishing
to
set
the
world
on
fire
i
forgot
to
mention
to
you
that
i
was
informed
by
a
man
of
veracity
that
two
persons
came
to
the
stake
to
drink
a
glass
of
the
blood
as
an
infallible
remedy
for
the
apoplexy
and
when
i
animadverted
in
the
company
where
it
was
mentioned
on
such
a
horrible
violation
of
nature
a
danish
lady
reproved
me
very
severely
asking
how
i
knew
that
it
was
not
a
cure
for
the
disease
adding
that
every
attempt
was
justifiable
in
search
of
health
i
did
not
you
may
imagine
enter
into
an
argument
with
a
person
the
slave
of
such
a
gross
prejudice
and
i
allude
to
it
not
only
as
a
trait
of
the
ignorance
of
the
people
but
to
censure
the
government
for
not
preventing
scenes
that
throw
an
odium
on
the
human
race
empiricism
is
not
peculiar
to
denmark
and
i
know
no
way
of
rooting
it
out
though
it
be
a
remnant
of
exploded
witchcraft
till
the
acquiring
a
general
knowledge
of
the
component
parts
of
the
human
frame
becomes
a
part
of
public
education
since
the
fire
the
inhabitants
have
been
very
assiduously
employed
in
searching
for
property
secreted
during
the
confusion
and
it
is
astonishing
how
many
people
formerly
termed
reputable
had
availed
themselves
of
the
common
calamity
to
purloin
what
the
flames
spared
others
expert
at
making
a
distinction
without
a
difference
concealed
what
they
found
not
troubling
themselves
to
inquire
for
the
owners
though
they
scrupled
to
search
for
plunder
anywhere
but
amongst
the
ruins
to
be
honester
than
the
laws
require
is
by
most
people
thought
a
work
of
supererogation
and
to
slip
through
the
grate
of
the
law
has
ever
exercised
the
abilities
of
adventurers
who
wish
to
get
rich
the
shortest
way
knavery
without
personal
danger
is
an
art
brought
to
great
perfection
by
the
statesman
and
swindler
and
meaner
knaves
are
not
tardy
in
following
their
footsteps
it
moves
my
gall
to
discover
some
of
the
commercial
frauds
practised
during
the
present
war
in
short
under
whatever
point
of
view
i
consider
society
it
appears
to
me
that
an
adoration
of
property
is
the
root
of
all
evil
here
it
does
not
render
the
people
enterprising
as
in
america
but
thrifty
and
cautious
i
never
therefore
was
in
a
capital
where
there
was
so
little
appearance
of
active
industry
and
as
for
gaiety
i
looked
in
vain
for
the
sprightly
gait
of
the
norwegians
who
in
every
respect
appear
to
me
to
have
got
the
start
of
them
this
difference
i
attribute
to
their
having
more
liberty
a
liberty
which
they
think
their
right
by
inheritance
whilst
the
danes
when
they
boast
of
their
negative
happiness
always
mention
it
as
the
boon
of
the
prince
royal
under
the
superintending
wisdom
of
count
bernstorff
vassalage
is
nevertheless
ceasing
throughout
the
kingdom
and
with
it
will
pass
away
that
sordid
avarice
which
every
modification
of
slavery
is
calculated
to
produce
if
the
chief
use
of
property
be
power
in
the
shape
of
the
respect
it
procures
is
it
not
among
the
inconsistencies
of
human
nature
most
incomprehensible
that
men
should
find
a
pleasure
in
hoarding
up
property
which
they
steal
from
their
necessities
even
when
they
are
convinced
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
display
such
an
enviable
superiority
is
not
this
the
situation
of
serfs
in
every
country
yet
a
rapacity
to
accumulate
money
seems
to
become
stronger
in
proportion
as
it
is
allowed
to
be
useless
wealth
does
not
appear
to
be
sought
for
amongst
the
danes
to
obtain
the
excellent
luxuries
of
life
for
a
want
of
taste
is
very
conspicuous
at
copenhagen
so
much
so
that
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
that
poor
matilda
offended
the
rigid
lutherans
by
aiming
to
refine
their
pleasures
the
elegance
which
she
wished
to
introduce
was
termed
lasciviousness
yet
i
do
not
find
that
the
absence
of
gallantry
renders
the
wives
more
chaste
or
the
husbands
more
constant
love
here
seems
to
corrupt
the
morals
without
polishing
the
manners
by
banishing
confidence
and
truth
the
charm
as
well
as
cement
of
domestic
life
a
gentleman
who
has
resided
in
this
city
some
time
assures
me
that
he
could
not
find
language
to
give
me
an
idea
of
the
gross
debaucheries
into
which
the
lower
order
of
people
fall
and
the
promiscuous
amours
of
the
men
of
the
middling
class
with
their
female
servants
debase
both
beyond
measure
weakening
every
species
of
family
affection
i
have
everywhere
been
struck
by
one
characteristic
difference
in
the
conduct
of
the
two
sexes
women
in
general
are
seduced
by
their
superiors
and
men
jilted
by
their
inferiors
rank
and
manners
awe
the
one
and
cunning
and
wantonness
subjugate
the
other
ambition
creeping
into
the
woman
passion
and
tyranny
giving
force
to
the
man
for
most
men
treat
their
mistresses
as
kings
do
their
favourites
is
not
man
then
the
tyrant
of
the
creation
still
harping
on
the
same
subject
you
will
exclaim
how
can
i
avoid
it
when
most
of
the
struggles
of
an
eventful
life
have
been
occasioned
by
the
oppressed
state
of
my
sex
we
reason
deeply
when
we
feel
forcibly
but
to
return
to
the
straight
road
of
observation
the
sensuality
so
prevalent
appears
to
me
to
arise
rather
from
indolence
of
mind
and
dull
senses
than
from
an
exuberance
of
life
which
often
fructifies
the
whole
character
when
the
vivacity
of
youthful
spirits
begins
to
subside
into
strength
of
mind
i
have
before
mentioned
that
the
men
are
domestic
tyrants
considering
them
as
fathers
brothers
or
husbands
but
there
is
a
kind
of
interregnum
between
the
reign
of
the
father
and
husband
which
is
the
only
period
of
freedom
and
pleasure
that
the
women
enjoy
young
people
who
are
attached
to
each
other
with
the
consent
of
their
friends
exchange
rings
and
are
permitted
to
enjoy
a
degree
of
liberty
together
which
i
have
never
noticed
in
any
other
country
the
days
of
courtship
are
therefore
prolonged
till
it
be
perfectly
convenient
to
marry
the
intimacy
often
becomes
very
tender
and
if
the
lover
obtain
the
privilege
of
a
husband
it
can
only
be
termed
half
by
stealth
because
the
family
is
wilfully
blind
it
happens
very
rarely
that
these
honorary
engagements
are
dissolved
or
disregarded
a
stigma
being
attached
to
a
breach
of
faith
which
is
thought
more
disgraceful
if
not
so
criminal
as
the
violation
of
the
do
not
forget
that
in
my
general
observations
i
do
not
pretend
to
sketch
a
national
character
but
merely
to
note
the
present
state
of
morals
and
manners
as
i
trace
the
progress
of
the
world
improvement
because
during
my
residence
in
different
countries
my
principal
object
has
been
to
take
such
a
dispassionate
view
of
men
as
will
lead
me
to
form
a
just
idea
of
the
nature
of
man
and
to
deal
ingenuously
with
you
i
believe
i
should
have
been
less
severe
in
the
remarks
i
have
made
on
the
vanity
and
depravity
of
the
french
had
i
travelled
towards
the
north
before
i
visited
france
the
interesting
picture
frequently
drawn
of
the
virtues
of
a
rising
people
has
i
fear
been
fallacious
excepting
the
accounts
of
the
enthusiasm
which
various
public
struggles
have
produced
we
talk
of
the
depravity
of
the
french
and
lay
a
stress
on
the
old
age
of
the
nation
yet
where
has
more
virtuous
enthusiasm
been
displayed
than
during
the
two
last
years
by
the
common
people
of
france
and
in
their
armies
i
am
obliged
sometimes
to
recollect
the
numberless
instances
which
i
have
either
witnessed
or
heard
well
authenticated
to
balance
the
account
of
horrors
alas
but
too
true
i
am
therefore
inclined
to
believe
that
the
gross
vices
which
i
have
always
seem
allied
with
simplicity
of
manners
are
the
concomitants
of
ignorance
what
for
example
has
piety
under
the
heathen
or
christian
system
been
but
a
blind
faith
in
things
contrary
to
the
principles
of
reason
and
could
poor
reason
make
considerable
advances
when
it
was
reckoned
the
highest
degree
of
virtue
to
do
violence
to
its
dictates
lutherans
preaching
reformation
have
built
a
reputation
for
sanctity
on
the
same
foundation
as
the
catholics
yet
i
do
not
perceive
that
a
regular
attendance
on
public
worship
and
their
other
observances
make
them
a
whit
more
true
in
their
affections
or
honest
in
their
private
transactions
it
seems
indeed
quite
as
easy
to
prevaricate
with
religious
injunctions
as
human
laws
when
the
exercise
of
their
reason
does
not
lead
people
to
acquire
principles
for
themselves
to
be
the
criterion
of
all
those
they
receive
from
others
if
travelling
as
the
completion
of
a
liberal
education
were
to
be
adopted
on
rational
grounds
the
northern
states
ought
to
be
visited
before
the
more
polished
parts
of
europe
to
serve
as
the
elements
even
of
the
knowledge
of
manners
only
to
be
acquired
by
tracing
the
various
shades
in
different
countries
but
when
visiting
distant
climes
a
momentary
social
sympathy
should
not
be
allowed
to
influence
the
conclusions
of
the
understanding
for
hospitality
too
frequently
leads
travellers
especially
those
who
travel
in
search
of
pleasure
to
make
a
false
estimate
of
the
virtues
of
a
nation
which
i
am
now
convinced
bear
an
exact
proportion
to
their
scientific
improvements
adieu
letter
xx
i
have
formerly
censured
the
french
for
their
extreme
attachment
to
theatrical
exhibitions
because
i
thought
that
they
tended
to
render
them
vain
and
unnatural
characters
but
i
must
acknowledge
especially
as
women
of
the
town
never
appear
in
the
parisian
as
at
our
theatres
that
the
little
saving
of
the
week
is
more
usefully
expended
there
every
sunday
than
in
porter
or
brandy
to
intoxicate
or
stupify
the
mind
the
common
people
of
france
have
a
great
superiority
over
that
class
in
every
other
country
on
this
very
score
it
is
merely
the
sobriety
of
the
parisians
which
renders
their
fetes
more
interesting
their
gaiety
never
becoming
disgusting
or
dangerous
as
is
always
the
case
when
liquor
circulates
intoxication
is
the
pleasure
of
savages
and
of
all
those
whose
employments
rather
exhaust
their
animal
spirits
than
exercise
their
faculties
is
not
this
in
fact
the
vice
both
in
england
and
the
northern
states
of
europe
which
appears
to
be
the
greatest
impediment
to
general
improvement
drinking
is
here
the
principal
relaxation
of
the
men
including
smoking
but
the
women
are
very
abstemious
though
they
have
no
public
amusements
as
a
substitute
i
ought
to
except
one
theatre
which
appears
more
than
is
necessary
for
when
i
was
there
it
was
not
half
full
and
neither
the
ladies
nor
actresses
displayed
much
fancy
in
their
dress
the
play
was
founded
on
the
story
of
the
mock
doctor
and
from
the
gestures
of
the
servants
who
were
the
best
actors
i
should
imagine
contained
some
humour
the
farce
termed
ballet
was
a
kind
of
pantomime
the
childish
incidents
of
which
were
sufficient
to
show
the
state
of
the
dramatic
art
in
denmark
and
the
gross
taste
of
the
audience
a
magician
in
the
disguise
of
a
tinker
enters
a
cottage
where
the
women
are
all
busy
ironing
and
rubs
a
dirty
against
the
linen
the
women
raise
a
and
dance
after
him
rousing
their
husbands
who
join
in
the
dance
but
get
the
start
of
them
in
the
pursuit
the
tinker
with
the
for
a
shield
renders
them
immovable
and
blacks
their
cheeks
each
laughs
at
the
other
unconscious
of
his
own
appearance
meanwhile
the
women
enter
to
enjoy
the
sport
the
rare
fun
with
other
incidents
of
the
same
species
the
singing
was
much
on
a
par
with
the
dancing
the
one
as
destitute
of
grace
as
the
other
of
expression
but
the
orchestra
was
well
filled
the
instrumental
being
far
superior
to
the
vocal
music
i
have
likewise
visited
the
public
library
and
museum
as
well
as
the
palace
of
rosembourg
this
palace
now
deserted
displays
a
gloomy
kind
of
grandeur
throughout
for
the
silence
of
spacious
apartments
always
makes
itself
to
be
felt
i
at
least
feel
it
and
i
listen
for
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
as
i
have
done
at
midnight
to
the
ticking
of
the
watch
encouraging
a
kind
of
fanciful
superstition
every
object
carried
me
back
to
past
times
and
impressed
the
manners
of
the
age
forcibly
on
my
mind
in
this
point
of
view
the
preservation
of
old
palaces
and
their
tarnished
furniture
is
useful
for
they
may
be
considered
as
historical
documents
the
vacuum
left
by
departed
greatness
was
everywhere
observable
whilst
the
battles
and
processions
portrayed
on
the
walls
told
you
who
had
here
excited
revelry
after
retiring
from
slaughter
or
dismissed
pageantry
in
search
of
pleasure
it
seemed
a
vast
tomb
full
of
the
shadowy
phantoms
of
those
who
had
played
or
toiled
their
hour
out
and
sunk
behind
the
tapestry
which
celebrated
the
conquests
of
love
or
war
could
they
be
no
more
to
whom
my
imagination
thus
gave
life
could
the
thoughts
of
which
there
remained
so
many
vestiges
have
vanished
quite
away
and
these
beings
composed
of
such
noble
materials
of
thinking
and
feeling
have
they
only
melted
into
the
elements
to
keep
in
motion
the
grand
mass
of
life
it
can
not
be
as
easily
could
i
believe
that
the
large
silver
lions
at
the
top
of
the
banqueting
room
thought
and
reasoned
but
avaunt
ye
waking
dreams
yet
i
can
not
describe
the
curiosities
to
you
there
were
cabinets
full
of
baubles
and
gems
and
swords
which
must
have
been
wielded
by
giant
hand
the
coronation
ornaments
wait
quietly
here
till
wanted
and
the
wardrobe
exhibits
the
vestments
which
formerly
graced
these
shows
it
is
a
pity
they
do
not
lend
them
to
the
actors
instead
of
allowing
them
to
perish
ingloriously
i
have
not
visited
any
other
palace
excepting
hirsholm
the
gardens
of
which
are
laid
out
with
taste
and
command
the
finest
views
the
country
affords
as
they
are
in
the
modern
and
english
style
i
thought
i
was
following
the
footsteps
of
matilda
who
wished
to
multiply
around
her
the
images
of
her
beloved
country
i
was
also
gratified
by
the
sight
of
a
norwegian
landscape
in
miniature
which
with
great
propriety
makes
a
part
of
the
danish
king
garden
the
cottage
is
well
imitated
and
the
whole
has
a
pleasing
effect
particularly
so
to
me
who
love
norway
its
peaceful
farms
and
spacious
wilds
the
public
library
consists
of
a
collection
much
larger
than
i
expected
to
see
and
it
is
well
arranged
of
the
value
of
the
icelandic
manuscripts
i
could
not
form
a
judgment
though
the
alphabet
of
some
of
them
amused
me
by
showing
what
immense
labour
men
will
submit
to
in
order
to
transmit
their
ideas
to
posterity
i
have
sometimes
thought
it
a
great
misfortune
for
individuals
to
acquire
a
certain
delicacy
of
sentiment
which
often
makes
them
weary
of
the
common
occurrences
of
life
yet
it
is
this
very
delicacy
of
feeling
and
thinking
which
probably
has
produced
most
of
the
performances
that
have
benefited
mankind
it
might
with
propriety
perhaps
be
termed
the
malady
of
genius
the
cause
of
that
characteristic
melancholy
which
grows
with
its
growth
and
strengthens
with
its
strength
there
are
some
good
pictures
in
the
royal
museum
do
not
start
i
am
not
going
to
trouble
you
with
a
dull
catalogue
or
stupid
criticisms
on
masters
to
whom
time
has
assigned
their
just
niche
in
the
temple
of
fame
had
there
been
any
by
living
artists
of
this
country
i
should
have
noticed
them
as
making
a
part
of
the
sketches
i
am
drawing
of
the
present
state
of
the
place
the
good
pictures
were
mixed
indiscriminately
with
the
bad
ones
in
order
to
assort
the
frames
the
same
fault
is
conspicuous
in
the
new
splendid
gallery
forming
at
paris
though
it
seems
an
obvious
thought
that
a
school
for
artists
ought
to
be
arranged
in
such
a
manner
as
to
show
the
progressive
discoveries
and
improvements
in
the
art
a
collection
of
the
dresses
arms
and
implements
of
the
laplanders
attracted
my
attention
displaying
that
first
species
of
ingenuity
which
is
rather
a
proof
of
patient
perseverance
than
comprehension
of
mind
the
specimens
of
natural
history
and
curiosities
of
art
were
likewise
huddled
together
without
that
scientific
order
which
alone
renders
them
useful
but
this
may
partly
have
been
occasioned
by
the
hasty
manner
in
which
they
were
removed
from
the
palace
when
in
flames
there
are
some
respectable
men
of
science
here
but
few
literary
characters
and
fewer
artists
they
want
encouragement
and
will
continue
i
fear
from
the
present
appearance
of
things
to
languish
unnoticed
a
long
time
for
neither
the
vanity
of
wealth
nor
the
enterprising
spirit
of
commerce
has
yet
thrown
a
glance
that
way
besides
the
prince
royal
determined
to
be
economical
almost
descends
to
parsimony
and
perhaps
depresses
his
subjects
by
labouring
not
to
oppress
them
for
his
intentions
always
seem
to
be
good
yet
nothing
can
give
a
more
forcible
idea
of
the
dulness
which
eats
away
all
activity
of
mind
than
the
insipid
routine
of
a
court
without
magnificence
or
elegance
the
prince
from
what
i
can
now
collect
has
very
moderate
abilities
yet
is
so
well
disposed
that
count
bernstorff
finds
him
as
tractable
as
he
could
wish
for
i
consider
the
count
as
the
real
sovereign
scarcely
behind
the
curtain
the
prince
having
none
of
that
obstinate
of
youth
so
often
the
forerunner
of
decision
of
character
he
and
the
princess
his
wife
dine
every
day
with
the
king
to
save
the
expense
of
two
tables
what
a
mummery
it
must
be
to
treat
as
a
king
a
being
who
has
lost
the
majesty
of
man
but
even
count
bernstorff
morality
submits
to
this
standing
imposition
and
he
avails
himself
of
it
sometimes
to
soften
a
refusal
of
his
own
by
saying
it
is
the
of
the
king
my
master
when
everybody
knows
that
he
has
neither
will
nor
memory
much
the
same
use
is
made
of
him
as
i
have
observed
some
termagant
wives
make
of
their
husbands
they
would
dwell
on
the
necessity
of
obeying
their
husbands
poor
passive
souls
who
never
were
allowed
when
they
wanted
to
conceal
their
own
tyranny
a
story
is
told
here
of
the
king
formerly
making
a
dog
counsellor
of
state
because
when
the
dog
accustomed
to
eat
at
the
royal
table
snatched
a
piece
of
meat
off
an
old
officer
plate
he
reproved
him
jocosely
saying
that
he
le
had
not
the
privilege
of
dining
with
his
majesty
a
privilege
annexed
to
this
distinction
the
burning
of
the
palace
was
in
fact
a
fortunate
circumstance
as
it
afforded
a
pretext
for
reducing
the
establishment
of
the
household
which
was
far
too
great
for
the
revenue
of
the
crown
the
prince
royal
at
present
runs
into
the
opposite
extreme
and
the
formality
if
not
the
parsimony
of
the
court
seems
to
extend
to
all
the
other
branches
of
society
which
i
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
though
hospitality
still
characterises
their
intercourse
with
strangers
but
let
me
now
stop
i
may
be
a
little
partial
and
view
everything
with
the
jaundiced
eye
of
melancholy
for
i
am
sad
and
have
cause
god
bless
you
letter
xxi
i
have
seen
count
bernstorff
and
his
conversation
confirms
me
in
the
opinion
i
had
previously
formed
of
him
i
mean
since
my
arrival
at
copenhagen
he
is
a
worthy
man
a
little
vain
of
his
virtue
necker
and
more
anxious
not
to
do
wrong
that
is
to
avoid
blame
than
desirous
of
doing
good
especially
if
any
particular
good
demands
a
change
prudence
in
short
seems
to
be
the
basis
of
his
character
and
from
the
tenor
of
the
government
i
should
think
inclining
to
that
cautious
circumspection
which
treads
on
the
heels
of
timidity
he
has
considerable
information
and
some
finesse
or
he
could
not
be
a
minister
determined
not
to
risk
his
popularity
for
he
is
tenderly
careful
of
his
reputation
he
will
never
gloriously
fail
like
struensee
or
disturb
with
the
energy
of
genius
the
stagnant
state
of
the
public
mind
i
suppose
that
lavater
whom
he
invited
to
visit
him
two
years
ago
some
say
to
fix
the
principles
of
the
christian
religion
firmly
in
the
prince
royal
mind
found
lines
in
his
face
to
prove
him
a
statesman
of
the
first
order
because
he
has
a
knack
at
seeing
a
great
character
in
the
countenances
of
men
in
exalted
stations
who
have
noticed
him
or
his
works
besides
the
count
sentiments
relative
to
the
french
revolution
agreeing
with
lavater
must
have
ensured
his
applause
the
danes
in
general
seem
extremely
averse
to
innovation
and
if
happiness
only
consist
in
opinion
they
are
the
happiest
people
in
the
world
for
i
never
saw
any
so
well
satisfied
with
their
own
situation
yet
the
climate
appears
to
be
very
disagreeable
the
weather
being
dry
and
sultry
or
moist
and
cold
the
atmosphere
never
having
that
sharp
bracing
purity
which
in
norway
prepares
you
to
brave
its
rigours
i
do
not
hear
the
inhabitants
of
this
place
talk
with
delight
of
the
winter
which
is
the
constant
theme
of
the
norwegians
on
the
contrary
they
seem
to
dread
its
comfortless
inclemency
the
ramparts
are
pleasant
and
must
have
been
much
more
so
before
the
fire
the
walkers
not
being
annoyed
by
the
clouds
of
dust
which
at
present
the
slightest
wind
wafts
from
the
ruins
the
windmills
and
the
comfortable
houses
contiguous
belonging
to
the
millers
as
well
as
the
appearance
of
the
spacious
barracks
for
the
soldiers
and
sailors
tend
to
render
this
walk
more
agreeable
the
view
of
the
country
has
not
much
to
recommend
it
to
notice
but
its
extent
and
cultivation
yet
as
the
eye
always
delights
to
dwell
on
verdant
plains
especially
when
we
are
resident
in
a
great
city
these
shady
walks
should
be
reckoned
amongst
the
advantages
procured
by
the
government
for
the
inhabitants
i
like
them
better
than
the
royal
gardens
also
open
to
the
public
because
the
latter
seem
sunk
in
the
heart
of
the
city
to
concentrate
its
fogs
the
canals
which
intersect
the
streets
are
equally
convenient
and
wholesome
but
the
view
of
the
sea
commanded
by
the
town
had
little
to
interest
me
whilst
the
remembrance
of
the
various
bold
and
picturesque
shores
i
had
seen
was
fresh
in
my
memory
still
the
opulent
inhabitants
who
seldom
go
abroad
must
find
the
spots
were
they
fix
their
country
seats
much
pleasanter
on
account
of
the
vicinity
of
the
ocean
one
of
the
best
streets
in
copenhagen
is
almost
filled
with
hospitals
erected
by
the
government
and
i
am
assured
as
well
regulated
as
institutions
of
this
kind
are
in
any
country
but
whether
hospitals
or
workhouses
are
anywhere
superintended
with
sufficient
humanity
i
have
frequently
had
reason
to
doubt
the
autumn
is
so
uncommonly
fine
that
i
am
unwilling
to
put
off
my
journey
to
hamburg
much
longer
lest
the
weather
should
alter
suddenly
and
the
chilly
harbingers
of
winter
catch
me
here
where
i
have
nothing
now
to
detain
me
but
the
hospitality
of
the
families
to
whom
i
had
recommendatory
letters
i
lodged
at
an
hotel
situated
in
a
large
open
square
where
the
troops
exercise
and
the
market
is
kept
my
apartments
were
very
good
and
on
account
of
the
fire
i
was
told
that
i
should
be
charged
very
high
yet
paying
my
bill
just
now
i
find
the
demands
much
lower
in
proportion
than
in
norway
though
my
dinners
were
in
every
respect
better
i
have
remained
more
at
home
since
i
arrived
at
copenhagen
than
i
ought
to
have
done
in
a
strange
place
but
the
mind
is
not
always
equally
active
in
search
of
information
and
my
oppressed
heart
too
often
sighs
out
how
dull
flat
and
unprofitable
are
to
me
all
the
usages
of
this
world
that
it
should
come
to
this
farewell
fare
thee
well
i
say
if
thou
canst
repeat
the
adieu
in
a
different
tone
letter
xxii
i
arrived
at
corsoer
the
night
after
i
quitted
copenhagen
purposing
to
take
my
passage
across
the
great
belt
the
next
morning
though
the
weather
was
rather
boisterous
it
is
about
miles
but
as
both
i
and
my
little
girl
are
never
attacked
by
though
who
can
avoid
i
enter
a
boat
with
the
same
indifference
as
i
change
horses
and
as
for
danger
come
when
it
may
i
dread
it
not
sufficiently
to
have
any
anticipating
fears
the
road
from
copenhagen
was
very
good
through
an
open
flat
country
that
had
little
to
recommend
it
to
notice
excepting
the
cultivation
which
gratified
my
heart
more
than
my
eye
i
took
a
barge
with
a
german
baron
who
was
hastening
back
from
a
tour
into
denmark
alarmed
by
the
intelligence
of
the
french
having
passed
the
rhine
his
conversation
beguiled
the
time
and
gave
a
sort
of
stimulus
to
my
spirits
which
had
been
growing
more
and
more
languid
ever
since
my
return
to
gothenburg
you
know
why
i
had
often
endeavoured
to
rouse
myself
to
observation
by
reflecting
that
i
was
passing
through
scenes
which
i
should
probably
never
see
again
and
consequently
ought
not
to
omit
observing
still
i
fell
into
reveries
thinking
by
way
of
excuse
that
enlargement
of
mind
and
refined
feelings
are
of
little
use
but
to
barb
the
arrows
of
sorrow
which
waylay
us
everywhere
eluding
the
sagacity
of
wisdom
and
rendering
principles
unavailing
if
considered
as
a
breastwork
to
secure
our
own
hearts
though
we
had
not
a
direct
wind
we
were
not
detained
more
than
three
hours
and
a
half
on
the
water
just
long
enough
to
give
us
an
appetite
for
our
dinner
we
travelled
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
the
following
night
in
company
with
the
same
party
the
german
gentleman
whom
i
have
mentioned
his
friend
and
servant
the
meetings
at
the
were
pleasant
to
me
who
usually
heard
nothing
but
strange
tongues
around
me
marguerite
and
the
child
often
fell
asleep
and
when
they
were
awake
i
might
still
reckon
myself
alone
as
our
train
of
thoughts
had
nothing
in
common
marguerite
it
is
true
was
much
amused
by
the
costume
of
the
women
particularly
by
the
pannier
which
adorned
both
their
heads
and
tails
and
with
great
glee
recounted
to
me
the
stories
she
had
treasured
up
for
her
family
when
once
more
within
the
barriers
of
dear
paris
not
forgetting
with
that
arch
agreeable
vanity
peculiar
to
the
french
which
they
exhibit
whilst
half
ridiculing
it
to
remind
me
of
the
importance
she
should
assume
when
she
informed
her
friends
of
all
her
journeys
by
sea
and
land
showing
the
pieces
of
money
she
had
collected
and
stammering
out
a
few
foreign
phrases
which
she
repeated
in
a
true
parisian
accent
happy
thoughtlessness
ay
and
enviable
harmless
vanity
which
thus
produced
a
du
worth
all
my
philosophy
the
man
i
had
hired
at
copenhagen
advised
me
to
go
round
about
twenty
miles
to
avoid
passing
the
little
belt
excepting
by
a
ferry
as
the
wind
was
contrary
but
the
gentlemen
overruled
his
arguments
which
we
were
all
very
sorry
for
afterwards
when
we
found
ourselves
becalmed
on
the
little
belt
ten
hours
tacking
about
without
ceasing
to
gain
the
shore
an
oversight
likewise
made
the
passage
appear
much
more
tedious
nay
almost
insupportable
when
i
went
on
board
at
the
great
belt
i
had
provided
refreshments
in
case
of
detention
which
remaining
untouched
i
thought
not
then
any
such
precaution
necessary
for
the
second
passage
misled
by
the
epithet
of
little
though
i
have
since
been
informed
that
it
is
frequently
the
longest
this
mistake
occasioned
much
vexation
for
the
child
at
last
began
to
cry
so
bitterly
for
bread
that
fancy
conjured
up
before
me
the
wretched
ugolino
with
his
famished
children
and
i
literally
speaking
enveloped
myself
in
sympathetic
horrors
augmented
by
every
fear
my
babe
shed
from
which
i
could
not
escape
till
we
landed
and
a
luncheon
of
bread
and
basin
of
milk
routed
the
spectres
of
fancy
i
then
supped
with
my
companions
with
whom
i
was
soon
after
to
part
for
ever
always
a
most
melancholy
idea
a
sort
of
separation
of
soul
for
all
the
regret
which
follows
those
from
whom
fate
separates
us
seems
to
be
something
torn
from
ourselves
these
were
strangers
i
remember
yet
when
there
is
any
originality
in
a
countenance
it
takes
its
place
in
our
memory
and
we
are
sorry
to
lose
an
acquaintance
the
moment
he
begins
to
interest
us
through
picked
up
on
the
highway
there
was
in
fact
a
degree
of
intelligence
and
still
more
sensibility
in
the
features
and
conversation
of
one
of
the
gentlemen
that
made
me
regret
the
loss
of
his
society
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
for
he
was
compelled
to
travel
post
by
his
desire
to
reach
his
estate
before
the
arrival
of
the
french
this
was
a
comfortable
inn
as
were
several
others
i
stopped
at
but
the
heavy
sandy
roads
were
very
fatiguing
after
the
fine
ones
we
had
lately
skimmed
over
both
in
sweden
and
denmark
the
country
resembled
the
most
open
part
of
england
laid
out
for
corn
rather
than
grazing
it
was
pleasant
yet
there
was
little
in
the
prospects
to
awaken
curiosity
by
displaying
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
a
new
country
which
had
so
frequently
stole
me
from
myself
in
norway
we
often
passed
over
large
unenclosed
tracts
not
graced
with
trees
or
at
least
very
sparingly
enlivened
by
them
and
the
roads
seemed
to
demand
the
landmarks
set
up
in
the
waste
to
prevent
the
traveller
from
straying
far
out
of
his
way
and
plodding
through
the
wearisome
sand
the
heaths
were
dreary
and
had
none
of
the
wild
charms
of
those
of
sweden
and
norway
to
cheat
time
neither
the
terrific
rocks
nor
smiling
herbage
grateful
to
the
sight
and
scented
from
afar
made
us
forget
their
length
still
the
country
appeared
much
more
populous
and
the
towns
if
not
the
farmhouses
were
superior
to
those
of
norway
i
even
thought
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
former
had
more
intelligence
at
least
i
am
sure
they
had
more
vivacity
in
their
countenances
than
i
had
seen
during
my
northern
tour
their
senses
seemed
awake
to
business
and
pleasure
i
was
therefore
gratified
by
hearing
once
more
the
busy
hum
of
industrious
men
in
the
day
and
the
exhilarating
sounds
of
joy
in
the
evening
for
as
the
weather
was
still
fine
the
women
and
children
were
amusing
themselves
at
their
doors
or
walking
under
the
trees
which
in
many
places
were
planted
in
the
streets
and
as
most
of
the
towns
of
any
note
were
situated
on
little
bays
or
branches
of
the
baltic
their
appearance
as
we
approached
was
often
very
picturesque
and
when
we
entered
displayed
the
comfort
and
cleanliness
of
easy
if
not
the
elegance
of
opulent
circumstances
but
the
cheerfulness
of
the
people
in
the
streets
was
particularly
grateful
to
me
after
having
been
depressed
by
the
deathlike
silence
of
those
of
denmark
where
every
house
made
me
think
of
a
tomb
the
dress
of
the
peasantry
is
suited
to
the
climate
in
short
none
of
that
poverty
and
dirt
appeared
at
the
sight
of
which
the
heart
sickens
as
i
only
stopped
to
change
horses
take
refreshment
and
sleep
i
had
not
an
opportunity
of
knowing
more
of
the
country
than
conclusions
which
the
information
gathered
by
my
eyes
enabled
me
to
draw
and
that
was
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
i
should
much
rather
have
lived
in
some
of
the
towns
i
now
pass
through
than
in
any
i
had
seen
in
sweden
or
denmark
the
people
struck
me
as
having
arrived
at
that
period
when
the
faculties
will
unfold
themselves
in
short
they
look
alive
to
improvement
neither
congealed
by
indolence
nor
bent
down
by
wretchedness
to
servility
from
the
previous
impression
i
scarcely
can
trace
whence
i
received
it
i
was
agreeably
surprised
to
perceive
such
an
appearance
of
comfort
in
this
part
of
germany
i
had
formed
a
conception
of
the
tyranny
of
the
petty
potentates
that
had
thrown
a
gloomy
veil
over
the
face
of
the
whole
country
in
my
imagination
that
cleared
away
like
the
darkness
of
night
before
the
sun
as
i
saw
the
reality
i
should
probably
have
discovered
much
lurking
misery
the
consequence
of
ignorant
oppression
no
doubt
had
i
had
time
to
inquire
into
particulars
but
it
did
not
stalk
abroad
and
infect
the
surface
over
which
my
eye
glanced
yes
i
am
persuaded
that
a
considerable
degree
of
general
knowledge
pervades
this
country
for
it
is
only
from
the
exercise
of
the
mind
that
the
body
acquires
the
activity
from
which
i
drew
these
inferences
indeed
the
king
of
denmark
german
dominions
holstein
appeared
to
me
far
superior
to
any
other
part
of
his
kingdom
which
had
fallen
under
my
view
and
the
robust
rustics
to
have
their
muscles
braced
instead
of
the
as
it
were
lounge
of
the
danish
peasantry
arriving
at
sleswick
the
residence
of
prince
charles
of
the
sight
of
the
soldiers
recalled
all
the
unpleasing
ideas
of
german
despotism
which
imperceptibly
vanished
as
i
advanced
into
the
country
i
viewed
with
a
mixture
of
pity
and
horror
these
beings
training
to
be
sold
to
slaughter
or
be
slaughtered
and
fell
into
reflections
on
an
old
opinion
of
mine
that
it
is
the
preservation
of
the
species
not
of
individuals
which
appears
to
be
the
design
of
the
deity
throughout
the
whole
of
nature
blossoms
come
forth
only
to
be
blighted
fish
lay
their
spawn
where
it
will
be
devoured
and
what
a
large
portion
of
the
human
race
are
born
merely
to
be
swept
prematurely
away
does
not
this
waste
of
budding
life
emphatically
assert
that
it
is
not
men
but
man
whose
preservation
is
so
necessary
to
the
completion
of
the
grand
plan
of
the
universe
children
peep
into
existence
suffer
and
die
men
play
like
moths
about
a
candle
and
sink
into
the
flame
war
and
the
thousand
ills
which
flesh
is
heir
to
mow
them
down
in
shoals
whilst
the
more
cruel
prejudices
of
society
palsy
existence
introducing
not
less
sure
though
slower
decay
the
castle
was
heavy
and
gloomy
yet
the
grounds
about
it
were
laid
out
with
some
taste
a
walk
winding
under
the
shade
of
lofty
trees
led
to
a
regularly
built
and
animated
town
i
crossed
the
drawbridge
and
entered
to
see
this
shell
of
a
court
in
miniature
mounting
ponderous
stairs
it
would
be
a
solecism
to
say
a
flight
up
which
a
regiment
of
men
might
have
marched
shouldering
their
firelocks
to
exercise
in
vast
galleries
where
all
the
generations
of
the
princes
of
might
have
been
mustered
rank
and
file
though
not
the
phantoms
of
all
the
wretched
they
had
bartered
to
support
their
state
unless
these
airy
substances
could
shrink
and
expand
like
milton
devils
to
suit
the
occasion
the
sight
of
the
and
of
the
canopy
to
shade
the
fauteuil
which
aped
a
throne
made
me
smile
all
the
world
is
a
stage
thought
i
and
few
are
there
in
it
who
do
not
play
the
part
they
have
learnt
by
rote
and
those
who
do
not
seem
marks
set
up
to
be
pelted
at
by
fortune
or
rather
as
which
point
out
the
road
to
others
whilst
forced
to
stand
still
themselves
amidst
the
mud
and
dust
waiting
for
our
horses
we
were
amused
by
observing
the
dress
of
the
women
which
was
very
grotesque
and
unwieldy
the
false
notion
of
beauty
which
prevails
here
as
well
as
in
denmark
i
should
think
very
inconvenient
in
summer
as
it
consists
in
giving
a
rotundity
to
a
certain
part
of
the
body
not
the
most
slim
when
nature
has
done
her
part
this
dutch
prejudice
often
leads
them
to
toil
under
the
weight
of
some
ten
or
a
dozen
petticoats
which
with
an
enormous
basket
literally
speaking
as
a
bonnet
or
a
straw
hat
of
dimensions
equally
gigantic
almost
completely
conceal
the
human
form
as
well
as
face
divine
often
worth
showing
still
they
looked
clean
and
tripped
along
as
it
were
before
the
wind
with
a
weight
of
tackle
that
i
could
scarcely
have
lifted
many
of
the
country
girls
i
met
appeared
to
me
pretty
that
is
to
have
fine
complexions
sparkling
eyes
and
a
kind
of
arch
hoyden
playfulness
which
distinguishes
the
village
coquette
the
swains
in
their
sunday
trim
attended
some
of
these
fair
ones
in
a
more
slouching
pace
though
their
dress
was
not
so
cumbersome
the
women
seem
to
take
the
lead
in
polishing
the
manners
everywhere
this
being
the
only
way
to
better
their
condition
from
what
i
have
seen
throughout
my
journey
i
do
not
think
the
situation
of
the
poor
in
england
is
much
if
at
all
superior
to
that
of
the
same
class
in
different
parts
of
the
world
and
in
ireland
i
am
sure
it
is
much
inferior
i
allude
to
the
former
state
of
england
for
at
present
the
accumulation
of
national
wealth
only
increases
the
cares
of
the
poor
and
hardens
the
hearts
of
the
rich
in
spite
of
the
highly
extolled
rage
for
almsgiving
you
know
that
i
have
always
been
an
enemy
to
what
is
termed
charity
because
timid
bigots
endeavouring
thus
to
cover
their
sins
do
violence
to
justice
till
acting
the
demigod
they
forget
that
they
are
men
and
there
are
others
who
do
not
even
think
of
laying
up
a
treasure
in
heaven
whose
benevolence
is
merely
tyranny
in
disguise
they
assist
the
most
worthless
because
the
most
servile
and
term
them
helpless
only
in
proportion
to
their
fawning
after
leaving
sleswick
we
passed
through
several
pretty
towns
itzchol
particularly
pleased
me
and
the
country
still
wearing
the
same
aspect
was
improved
by
the
appearance
of
more
trees
and
enclosures
but
what
gratified
me
most
was
the
population
i
was
weary
of
travelling
four
or
five
hours
never
meeting
a
carriage
and
scarcely
a
peasant
and
then
to
stop
at
such
wretched
huts
as
i
had
seen
in
sweden
was
surely
sufficient
to
chill
any
heart
awake
to
sympathy
and
throw
a
gloom
over
my
favourite
subject
of
contemplation
the
future
improvement
of
the
world
the
farmhouses
likewise
with
the
huge
stables
into
which
we
drove
whilst
the
horses
were
putting
to
or
baiting
were
very
clean
and
commodious
the
rooms
with
a
door
into
this
stable
and
storehouse
in
one
were
decent
and
there
was
a
compactness
in
the
appearance
of
the
whole
family
lying
thus
snugly
together
under
the
same
roof
that
carried
my
fancy
back
to
the
primitive
times
which
probably
never
existed
with
such
a
golden
lustre
as
the
animated
imagination
lends
when
only
able
to
seize
the
prominent
features
at
one
of
them
a
pretty
young
woman
with
languishing
eyes
of
celestial
blue
conducted
us
into
a
very
neat
parlour
and
observing
how
loosely
and
lightly
my
little
girl
was
clad
began
to
pity
her
in
the
sweetest
accents
regardless
of
the
rosy
down
of
health
on
her
cheeks
this
same
damsel
was
dressed
it
was
sunday
with
taste
and
even
coquetry
in
a
cotton
jacket
ornamented
with
knots
of
blue
ribbon
fancifully
disposed
to
give
life
to
her
fine
complexion
i
loitered
a
little
to
admire
her
for
every
gesture
was
graceful
and
amidst
the
other
villagers
she
looked
like
a
garden
lily
suddenly
rearing
its
head
amongst
grain
and
as
the
house
was
small
i
gave
her
a
piece
of
money
rather
larger
than
it
was
my
custom
to
give
to
the
female
waiters
for
i
could
not
prevail
on
her
to
sit
down
which
she
received
with
a
smile
yet
took
care
to
give
it
in
my
presence
to
a
girl
who
had
brought
the
child
a
slice
of
bread
by
which
i
perceived
that
she
was
the
mistress
or
daughter
of
the
house
and
without
doubt
the
belle
of
the
village
there
was
in
short
an
appearance
of
cheerful
industry
and
of
that
degree
of
comfort
which
shut
out
misery
in
all
the
little
hamlets
as
i
approached
hamburg
which
agreeably
surprised
me
the
short
jackets
which
the
women
wear
here
as
well
as
in
france
are
not
only
more
becoming
to
the
person
but
much
better
calculated
for
women
who
have
rustic
or
household
employments
than
the
long
gowns
worn
in
england
dangling
in
the
dirt
all
the
inns
on
the
road
were
better
than
i
expected
though
the
softness
of
the
beds
still
harassed
me
and
prevented
my
finding
the
rest
i
was
frequently
in
want
of
to
enable
me
to
bear
the
fatigue
of
the
next
day
the
charges
were
moderate
and
the
people
very
civil
with
a
certain
honest
hilarity
and
independent
spirit
in
their
manner
which
almost
made
me
forget
that
they
were
innkeepers
a
set
of
men
waiters
hostesses
chambermaids
down
to
the
ostler
whose
cunning
servility
in
england
i
think
particularly
disgusting
the
prospect
of
hamburg
at
a
distance
as
well
as
the
fine
road
shaded
with
trees
led
me
to
expect
to
see
a
much
pleasanter
city
than
i
found
i
was
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
lodgings
even
at
the
inns
on
account
of
the
concourse
of
strangers
at
present
resorting
to
such
a
centrical
situation
and
determined
to
go
to
altona
the
next
day
to
seek
for
an
abode
wanting
now
only
rest
but
even
for
a
single
night
we
were
sent
from
house
to
house
and
found
at
last
a
vacant
room
to
sleep
in
which
i
should
have
turned
from
with
disgust
had
there
been
a
choice
i
scarcely
know
anything
that
produces
more
disagreeable
sensations
i
mean
to
speak
of
the
passing
cares
the
recollection
of
which
afterwards
enlivens
our
enjoyments
than
those
excited
by
little
disasters
of
this
kind
after
a
long
journey
with
our
eyes
directed
to
some
particular
spot
to
arrive
and
find
nothing
as
it
should
be
is
vexatious
and
sinks
the
agitated
spirits
but
i
who
received
the
cruellest
of
disappointments
last
spring
in
returning
to
my
home
term
such
as
these
emphatically
passing
cares
know
you
of
what
materials
some
hearts
are
made
i
play
the
child
and
weep
at
the
recollection
for
the
grief
is
still
fresh
that
stunned
as
well
as
wounded
me
yet
never
did
drops
of
anguish
like
these
bedew
the
cheeks
of
infantine
innocence
and
why
should
they
mine
that
never
was
stained
by
a
blush
of
guilt
innocent
and
credulous
as
a
child
why
have
i
not
the
same
happy
thoughtlessness
adieu
letter
xxiii
i
might
have
spared
myself
the
disagreeable
feelings
i
experienced
the
first
night
of
my
arrival
at
hamburg
leaving
the
open
air
to
be
shut
up
in
noise
and
dirt
had
i
gone
immediately
to
altona
where
a
lodging
had
been
prepared
for
me
by
a
gentleman
from
whom
i
received
many
civilities
during
my
journey
i
wished
to
have
travelled
in
company
with
him
from
copenhagen
because
i
found
him
intelligent
and
friendly
but
business
obliged
him
to
hurry
forward
and
i
wrote
to
him
on
the
subject
of
accommodations
as
soon
as
i
was
informed
of
the
difficulties
i
might
have
to
encounter
to
house
myself
and
brat
it
is
but
a
short
and
pleasant
walk
from
hamburg
to
altona
under
the
shade
of
several
rows
of
trees
and
this
walk
is
the
more
agreeable
after
quitting
the
rough
pavement
of
either
place
hamburg
is
an
ill
town
swarming
with
inhabitants
and
from
what
i
could
learn
like
all
the
other
free
towns
governed
in
a
manner
which
bears
hard
on
the
poor
whilst
narrowing
the
minds
of
the
rich
the
character
of
the
man
is
lost
in
the
hamburger
always
afraid
of
the
encroachments
of
their
danish
neighbours
that
is
anxiously
apprehensive
of
their
sharing
the
golden
harvest
of
commerce
with
them
or
taking
a
little
of
the
trade
off
their
hands
though
they
have
more
than
they
know
what
to
do
with
they
are
ever
on
the
watch
till
their
very
eyes
lose
all
expression
excepting
the
prying
glance
of
suspicion
the
gates
of
hamburg
are
shut
at
seven
in
the
winter
and
nine
in
the
summer
lest
some
strangers
who
come
to
traffic
in
hamburg
should
prefer
living
and
consequently
so
exactly
do
they
calculate
spend
their
money
out
of
the
walls
of
the
hamburger
world
immense
fortunes
have
been
acquired
by
the
arising
from
commissions
nominally
only
two
and
a
half
but
mounted
to
eight
or
ten
at
least
by
the
secret
manoeuvres
of
trade
not
to
include
the
advantage
of
purchasing
goods
wholesale
in
common
with
contractors
and
that
of
having
so
much
money
left
in
their
hands
not
to
play
with
i
can
assure
you
mushroom
fortunes
have
started
up
during
the
war
the
men
indeed
seem
of
the
species
of
the
fungus
and
the
insolent
vulgarity
which
a
sudden
influx
of
wealth
usually
produces
in
common
minds
is
here
very
conspicuous
which
contrasts
with
the
distresses
of
many
of
the
emigrants
fallen
fallen
from
their
high
estate
such
are
the
ups
and
downs
of
wheel
many
emigrants
have
met
with
fortitude
such
a
total
change
of
circumstances
as
scarcely
can
be
paralleled
retiring
from
a
palace
to
an
obscure
lodging
with
dignity
but
the
greater
number
glide
about
the
ghosts
of
greatness
with
the
de
ostentatiously
displayed
determined
to
hope
though
heaven
and
earth
their
wishes
crossed
still
good
breeding
points
out
the
gentleman
and
sentiments
of
honour
and
delicacy
appear
the
offspring
of
greatness
of
soul
when
compared
with
the
grovelling
views
of
the
sordid
accumulators
of
cent
per
cent
situation
seems
to
be
the
mould
in
which
men
characters
are
formed
so
much
so
inferring
from
what
i
have
lately
seen
that
i
mean
not
to
be
severe
when
i
add
previously
asking
why
priests
are
in
general
cunning
and
statesmen
false
that
men
entirely
devoted
to
commerce
never
acquire
or
lose
all
taste
and
greatness
of
mind
an
ostentatious
display
of
wealth
without
elegance
and
a
greedy
enjoyment
of
pleasure
without
sentiment
embrutes
them
till
they
term
all
virtue
of
an
heroic
cast
romantic
attempts
at
something
above
our
nature
and
anxiety
about
the
welfare
of
others
a
search
after
misery
in
which
we
have
no
concern
but
you
will
say
that
i
am
growing
bitter
perhaps
personal
ah
shall
i
whisper
to
you
that
you
yourself
are
strangely
altered
since
you
have
entered
deeply
into
commerce
more
than
you
are
aware
of
never
allowing
yourself
to
reflect
and
keeping
your
mind
or
rather
passions
in
a
continual
state
of
agitation
nature
has
given
you
talents
which
lie
dormant
or
are
wasted
in
ignoble
pursuits
you
will
rouse
yourself
and
shake
off
the
vile
dust
that
obscures
you
or
my
understanding
as
well
as
my
heart
deceives
me
egregiously
only
tell
me
when

to
go
farther
afield
madame

the
day
i
arrived
to
endeavour
at
vienna
to
obtain
the
enlargement
of
her

lived
in

assisting

her
prosperity
and
consequent
idleness
she
did
not
i
am
told
enjoy
a
good
state
of
health
having
a
train
of
nervous
complaints
which
though
they
have
not
a
name
unless
the
significant
word
be
borrowed
had
an
existence
in
the
higher
french
circles
but
adversity
and
virtuous
exertions
put
these
ills
to
flight
and
dispossessed
her
of
a
devil
who
deserves
the
appellation
of
legion
madame
genus
also
resided
at
altona
some
time
under
an
assumed
name
with
many
other
sufferers
of
less
note
though
higher
rank
it
is
in
fact
scarcely
possible
to
stir
out
without
meeting
interesting
countenances
every
lineament
of
which
tells
you
that
they
have
seen
better
days
at
hamburg
i
was
informed
a
duke
had
entered
into
partnership
with
his
cook
who
becoming
a
they
were
both
comfortably
supported
by
the
profit
arising
from
his
industry
many
noble
instances
of
the
attachment
of
servants
to
their
unfortunate
masters
have
come
to
my
knowledge
both
here
and
in
france
and
touched
my
heart
the
greatest
delight
of
which
is
to
discover
human
virtue
at
altona
a
president
of
one
of
the
parliaments
keeps
an
ordinary
in
the
french
style
and
his
wife
with
cheerful
dignity
submits
to
her
fate
though
she
is
arrived
at
an
age
when
people
seldom
relinquish
their
prejudices
a
girl
who
waits
there
brought
a
dozen
louis
concealed
in
her
clothes
at
the
risk
of
her
life
from
france
which
she
preserves
lest
sickness
or
any
other
distress
should
overtake
her
mistress
who
she
observed
was
not
accustomed
to
hardships
this
house
was
particularly
recommended
to
me
by
an
acquaintance
of
yours
the
author
of
the
american
farmer
letters
i
generally
dine
in
company
with
him
and
the
gentleman
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
is
often
diverted
by
our
declamations
against
commerce
when
we
compare
notes
respecting
the
characteristics
of
the
hamburgers
why
madam
said
he
to
me
one
day
you
will
not
meet
with
a
man
who
has
any
calf
to
his
leg
body
and
soul
muscles
and
heart
are
equally
shrivelled
up
by
a
thirst
of
gain
there
is
nothing
generous
even
in
their
youthful
passions
profit
is
their
only
stimulus
and
calculations
the
sole
employment
of
their
faculties
unless
we
except
some
gross
animal
gratifications
which
snatched
at
spare
moments
tend
still
more
to
debase
the
character
because
though
touched
by
his
tricking
wand
they
have
all
the
arts
without
the
wit
of
the
god
perhaps
you
may
also
think
us
too
severe
but
i
must
add
that
the
more
i
saw
of
the
manners
of
hamburg
the
more
was
i
confirmed
in
my
opinion
relative
to
the
baleful
effect
of
extensive
speculations
on
the
moral
character
men
are
strange
machines
and
their
whole
system
of
morality
is
in
general
held
together
by
one
grand
principle
which
loses
its
force
the
moment
they
allow
themselves
to
break
with
impunity
over
the
bounds
which
secured
their
a
man
ceases
to
love
humanity
and
then
individuals
as
he
advances
in
the
chase
after
wealth
as
one
clashes
with
his
interest
the
other
with
his
pleasures
to
business
as
it
is
termed
everything
must
give
way
nay
is
sacrificed
and
all
the
endearing
charities
of
citizen
husband
father
brother
become
empty
names
but
but
what
why
to
snap
the
chain
of
thought
i
must
say
farewell
cassandra
was
not
the
only
prophetess
whose
warning
voice
has
been
disregarded
how
much
easier
it
is
to
meet
with
love
in
the
world
than
affection
yours
sincerely
letter
xxiv
my
lodgings
at
altona
are
tolerably
comfortable
though
not
in
any
proportion
to
the
price
i
pay
but
owing
to
the
present
circumstances
all
the
necessaries
of
life
are
here
extravagantly
dear
considering
it
as
a
temporary
residence
the
chief
inconvenience
of
which
i
am
inclined
to
complain
is
the
rough
streets
that
must
be
passed
before
marguerite
and
the
child
can
reach
a
level
road
the
views
of
the
elbe
in
the
vicinity
of
the
town
are
pleasant
particularly
as
the
prospects
here
afford
so
little
variety
i
attempted
to
descend
and
walk
close
to
the
water
edge
but
there
was
no
path
and
the
smell
of
glue
hanging
to
dry
an
extensive
manufactory
of
which
is
carried
on
close
to
the
beach
i
found
extremely
disagreeable
but
to
commerce
everything
must
give
way
profit
and
profit
are
the
only
speculations
double
double
toil
and
trouble
i
have
seldom
entered
a
shady
walk
without
being
soon
obliged
to
turn
aside
to
make
room
for
the
and
the
only
tree
i
have
seen
that
appeared
to
be
planted
by
the
hand
of
taste
is
in
the
churchyard
to
shade
the
tomb
of
the
poet
klopstock
wife
most
of
the
merchants
have
country
houses
to
retire
to
during
the
summer
and
many
of
them
are
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
elbe
where
they
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
arrive
the
periods
of
most
consequence
to
divide
their
week
the
moving
picture
consisting
of
large
vessels
and
small
craft
which
are
continually
changing
their
position
with
the
tide
renders
this
noble
river
the
vital
stream
of
hamburg
very
interesting
and
the
windings
have
sometimes
a
very
fine
effect
two
or
three
turns
being
visible
at
once
intersecting
the
flat
meadows
a
sudden
bend
often
increasing
the
magnitude
of
the
river
and
the
silvery
expanse
scarcely
gliding
though
bearing
on
its
bosom
so
much
treasure
looks
for
a
moment
like
a
tranquil
lake
nothing
can
be
stronger
than
the
contrast
which
this
flat
country
and
strand
afford
compared
with
the
mountains
and
rocky
coast
i
have
lately
dwelt
so
much
among
in
fancy
i
return
to
a
favourite
spot
where
i
seemed
to
have
retired
from
man
and
wretchedness
but
the
din
of
trade
drags
me
back
to
all
the
care
i
left
behind
when
lost
in
sublime
emotions
rocks
aspiring
towards
the
heavens
and
as
it
were
shutting
out
sorrow
surrounded
me
whilst
peace
appeared
to
steal
along
the
lake
to
calm
my
bosom
modulating
the
wind
that
agitated
the
neighbouring
poplars
now
i
hear
only
an
account
of
the
tricks
of
trade
or
listen
to
the
distressful
tale
of
some
victim
of
ambition
the
hospitality
of
hamburg
is
confined
to
sunday
invitations
to
the
country
houses
i
have
mentioned
when
dish
after
dish
smokes
upon
the
board
and
the
conversation
ever
flowing
in
the
muddy
channel
of
business
it
is
not
easy
to
obtain
any
appropriate
information
had
i
intended
to
remain
here
some
time
or
had
my
mind
been
more
alive
to
general
inquiries
i
should
have
endeavoured
to
have
been
introduced
to
some
characters
not
so
entirely
immersed
in
commercial
affairs
though
in
this
whirlpool
of
gain
it
is
not
very
easy
to
find
any
but
the
wretched
or
supercilious
emigrants
who
are
not
engaged
in
pursuits
which
in
my
eyes
appear
as
dishonourable
as
gambling
the
interests
of
nations
are
bartered
by
speculating
merchants
my
god
with
what
artful
trains
of
corruption
bring
lucrative
commissions
into
particular
hands
disregarding
the
relative
situation
of
different
countries
and
can
much
common
honesty
be
expected
in
the
discharge
of
trusts
obtained
by
fraud
but
this
during
my
present
journey
and
whilst
residing
in
france
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
peeping
behind
the
scenes
of
what
are
vulgarly
termed
great
affairs
only
to
discover
the
mean
machinery
which
has
directed
many
transactions
of
moment
the
sword
has
been
merciful
compared
with
the
depredations
made
on
human
life
by
contractors
and
by
the
swarm
of
locusts
who
have
battened
on
the
pestilence
they
spread
abroad
these
men
like
the
owners
of
negro
ships
never
smell
on
their
money
the
blood
by
which
it
has
been
gained
but
sleep
quietly
in
their
beds
terming
such
occupations
lawful
callings
yet
the
lightning
marks
not
their
roofs
to
thunder
conviction
on
them
and
to
justify
the
ways
of
god
to
man
why
should
i
weep
for
myself
take

much
indebted

letter
xxv
there
is
a
pretty
little
french
theatre
at
altona
and
the
actors
are
much
superior
to
those
i
saw
at
copenhagen
the
theatres
at
hamburg
are
not
open
yet
but
will
very
shortly
when
the
shutting
of
the
gates
at
seven
forces
the
citizens
to
quit
their
country
houses
but
respecting
hamburg
i
shall
not
be
able
to
obtain
much
more
information
as
i
have
determined
to
sail
with
the
first
fair
wind
for
england
the
presence
of
the
french
army
would
have
rendered
my
intended
tour
through
germany
in
my
way
to
switzerland
almost
impracticable
had
not
the
advancing
season
obliged
me
to
alter
my
plan
besides
though
switzerland
is
the
country
which
for
several
years
i
have
been
particularly
desirous
to
visit
i
do
not
feel
inclined
to
ramble
any
farther
this
year
nay
i
am
weary
of
changing
the
scene
and
quitting
people
and
places
the
moment
they
begin
to
interest
me
this
also
is
vanity
dover
i
left
this
letter
unfinished
as
i
was
hurried
on
board
and
now
i
have
only
to
tell
you
that
at
the
sight
of
dover
cliffs
i
wondered
how
anybody
could
term
them
grand
they
appear
so
insignificant
to
me
after
those
i
had
seen
in
sweden
and
norway
adieu
my
spirit
of
observation
seems
to
be
fled
and
i
have
been
wandering
round
this
dirty
place
literally
speaking
to
kill
time
though
the
thoughts
i
would
fain
fly
from
lie
too
close
to
my
heart
to
be
easily
shook
off
or
even
beguiled
by
any
employment
except
that
of
preparing
for
my
journey
to
london
god
bless
you
mary
appendix
private
business
and
cares
have
frequently
so
absorbed
me
as
to
prevent
my
obtaining
all
the
information
during
this
journey
which
the
novelty
of
the
scenes
would
have
afforded
had
my
attention
been
continually
awake
to
inquiry
this
insensibility
to
present
objects
i
have
often
had
occasion
to
lament
since
i
have
been
preparing
these
letters
for
the
press
but
as
a
person
of
any
thought
naturally
considers
the
history
of
a
strange
country
to
contrast
the
former
with
the
present
state
of
its
manners
a
conviction
of
the
increasing
knowledge
and
happiness
of
the
kingdoms
i
passed
through
was
perpetually
the
result
of
my
comparative
reflections
the
poverty
of
the
poor
in
sweden
renders
the
civilisation
very
partial
and
slavery
has
retarded
the
improvement
of
every
class
in
denmark
yet
both
are
advancing
and
the
gigantic
evils
of
despotism
and
anarchy
have
in
a
great
measure
vanished
before
the
meliorating
manners
of
europe
innumerable
evils
still
remain
it
is
true
to
afflict
the
humane
investigator
and
hurry
the
benevolent
reformer
into
a
labyrinth
of
error
who
aims
at
destroying
prejudices
quickly
which
only
time
can
root
out
as
the
public
opinion
becomes
subject
to
reason
an
ardent
affection
for
the
human
race
makes
enthusiastic
characters
eager
to
produce
alteration
in
laws
and
governments
prematurely
to
render
them
useful
and
permanent
they
must
be
the
growth
of
each
particular
soil
and
the
gradual
fruit
of
the
ripening
understanding
of
the
nation
matured
by
time
not
forced
by
an
unnatural
fermentation
and
to
convince
me
that
such
a
change
is
gaining
ground
with
accelerating
pace
the
view
i
have
had
of
society
during
my
northern
journey
would
have
been
sufficient
had
i
not
previously
considered
the
grand
causes
which
combine
to
carry
mankind
forward
and
diminish
the
sum
of
human
misery
