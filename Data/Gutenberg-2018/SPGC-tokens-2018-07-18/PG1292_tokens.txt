the
way
of
the
world
a
comedy
est
operæ
mæchis
non
i
doti
to
the
right
honourable
ralph
earl
of
mountague
etc
my
lord
the
world
will
arraign
me
of
vanity
or
not
that
i
have
presumed
to
dedicate
this
comedy
to
your
lordship
i
am
yet
in
doubt
though
it
may
be
it
is
some
degree
of
vanity
even
to
doubt
of
it
one
who
has
at
any
time
had
the
honour
of
your
lordship
s
conversation
can
not
be
supposed
to
think
very
meanly
of
that
which
he
would
prefer
to
your
perusal
yet
it
were
to
incur
the
imputation
of
too
much
sufficiency
to
pretend
to
such
a
merit
as
might
abide
the
test
of
your
lordship
s
censure
whatever
value
may
be
wanting
to
this
play
while
yet
it
is
mine
will
be
sufficiently
made
up
to
it
when
it
is
once
become
your
lordship
s
and
it
is
my
security
that
i
can
not
have
overrated
it
more
by
my
dedication
than
your
lordship
will
dignify
it
by
your
patronage
that
it
succeeded
on
the
stage
was
almost
beyond
my
expectation
for
but
little
of
it
was
prepared
for
that
general
taste
which
seems
now
to
be
predominant
in
the
palates
of
our
audience
those
characters
which
are
meant
to
be
ridiculed
in
most
of
our
comedies
are
of
fools
so
gross
that
in
my
humble
opinion
they
should
rather
disturb
than
divert
the
and
reflecting
part
of
an
audience
they
are
rather
objects
of
charity
than
contempt
and
instead
of
moving
our
mirth
they
ought
very
often
to
excite
our
compassion
this
reflection
moved
me
to
design
some
characters
which
should
appear
ridiculous
not
so
much
through
a
natural
folly
which
is
incorrigible
and
therefore
not
proper
for
the
stage
as
through
an
affected
wit
a
wit
which
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
affected
is
also
false
as
there
is
some
difficulty
in
the
formation
of
a
character
of
this
nature
so
there
is
some
hazard
which
attends
the
progress
of
its
success
upon
the
stage
for
many
come
to
a
play
so
overcharged
with
criticism
that
they
very
often
let
fly
their
censure
when
through
their
rashness
they
have
mistaken
their
aim
this
i
had
occasion
lately
to
observe
for
this
play
had
been
acted
two
or
three
days
before
some
of
these
hasty
judges
could
find
the
leisure
to
distinguish
betwixt
the
character
of
a
witwoud
and
a
truewit
i
must
beg
your
lordship
s
pardon
for
this
digression
from
the
true
course
of
this
epistle
but
that
it
may
not
seem
altogether
impertinent
i
beg
that
i
may
plead
the
occasion
of
it
in
part
of
that
excuse
of
which
i
stand
in
need
for
recommending
this
comedy
to
your
protection
it
is
only
by
the
countenance
of
your
lordship
and
the
so
qualified
that
such
who
write
with
care
and
pains
can
hope
to
be
distinguished
for
the
prostituted
name
of
poet
promiscuously
levels
all
that
bear
it
terence
the
most
correct
writer
in
the
world
had
a
scipio
and
a
lelius
if
not
to
assist
him
at
least
to
support
him
in
his
reputation
and
notwithstanding
his
extraordinary
merit
it
may
be
their
countenance
was
not
more
than
necessary
the
purity
of
his
style
the
delicacy
of
his
turns
and
the
justness
of
his
characters
were
all
of
them
beauties
which
the
greater
part
of
his
audience
were
incapable
of
tasting
some
of
the
coarsest
strokes
of
plautus
so
severely
censured
by
horace
were
more
likely
to
affect
the
multitude
such
who
come
with
expectation
to
laugh
at
the
last
act
of
a
play
and
are
better
entertained
with
two
or
three
unseasonable
jests
than
with
the
artful
solution
of
the
fable
as
terence
excelled
in
his
performances
so
had
he
great
advantages
to
encourage
his
undertakings
for
he
built
most
on
the
foundations
of
menander
his
plots
were
generally
modelled
and
his
characters
ready
drawn
to
his
hand
he
copied
menander
and
menander
had
no
less
light
in
the
formation
of
his
characters
from
the
observations
of
theophrastus
of
whom
he
was
a
disciple
and
theophrastus
it
is
known
was
not
only
the
disciple
but
the
immediate
successor
of
aristotle
the
first
and
greatest
judge
of
poetry
these
were
great
models
to
design
by
and
the
further
advantage
which
terence
possessed
towards
giving
his
plays
the
due
ornaments
of
purity
of
style
and
justness
of
manners
was
not
less
considerable
from
the
freedom
of
conversation
which
was
permitted
him
with
lelius
and
scipio
two
of
the
greatest
and
most
polite
men
of
his
age
and
indeed
the
privilege
of
such
a
conversation
is
the
only
certain
means
of
attaining
to
the
perfection
of
dialogue
if
it
has
happened
in
any
part
of
this
comedy
that
i
have
gained
a
turn
of
style
or
expression
more
correct
or
at
least
more
corrigible
than
in
those
which
i
have
formerly
written
i
must
with
equal
pride
and
gratitude
ascribe
it
to
the
honour
of
your
lordship
s
admitting
me
into
your
conversation
and
that
of
a
society
where
everybody
else
was
so
well
worthy
of
you
in
your
retirement
last
summer
from
the
town
for
it
was
immediately
after
that
this
comedy
was
written
if
i
have
failed
in
my
performance
it
is
only
to
be
regretted
where
there
were
so
many
not
inferior
either
to
a
scipio
or
a
lelius
that
there
should
be
one
wanting
equal
in
capacity
to
a
terence
if
i
am
not
mistaken
poetry
is
almost
the
only
art
which
has
not
yet
laid
claim
to
your
lordship
s
patronage
architecture
and
painting
to
the
great
honour
of
our
country
have
flourished
under
your
influence
and
protection
in
the
meantime
poetry
the
eldest
sister
of
all
arts
and
parent
of
most
seems
to
have
resigned
her
birthright
by
having
neglected
to
pay
her
duty
to
your
lordship
and
by
permitting
others
of
a
later
extraction
to
prepossess
that
place
in
your
esteem
to
which
none
can
pretend
a
better
title
poetry
in
its
nature
is
sacred
to
the
good
and
great
the
relation
between
them
is
reciprocal
and
they
are
ever
propitious
to
it
it
is
the
privilege
of
poetry
to
address
them
and
it
is
their
prerogative
alone
to
give
it
protection
this
received
maxim
is
a
general
apology
for
all
writers
who
consecrate
their
labours
to
great
men
but
i
could
wish
at
this
time
that
this
address
were
exempted
from
the
common
pretence
of
all
dedications
and
that
as
i
can
distinguish
your
lordship
even
among
the
most
deserving
so
this
offering
might
become
remarkable
by
some
particular
instance
of
respect
which
should
assure
your
lordship
that
i
am
with
all
due
sense
of
your
extreme
worthiness
and
humanity
my
lord
your
lordship
s
most
obedient
and
most
obliged

kind

so
much
she
dotes
on
her
adopted
care
poets
are
bubbles
by
the
town
drawn
in

at
first
some
trifling
stakes
to
win
but
what
unequal
hazards
do
they
run
each
time
they
write
they
venture

they

won
the
squire
that

buttered

this
author
heretofore
has
found
your
favour
but
pleads
no
merit
from
his
past
behaviour
to
build
on
that
might
prove
a
vain
presumption
should
grants
to
poets
made
admit
resumption
and
in
parnassus
he
must
lose
his
seat
if
that
be
found
a

estate

our
play

with

and

last
night
after
i
left
you
my
fair
cousin
has
some
humours
that
would
tempt
the
patience
of
a
stoic
what
some
coxcomb
came
in
and
was
well
received
by
her
while
you
were
by
mira

and
what
was
worse
her
aunt
your

mother
my
evil
to
sum
up
all
in
her
own
name
my
old
lady
wishfort
came
in
fain
oh
there
it
is
then
she
has
a
lasting
passion
for
you
and
with
then
my
wife
was
there
mira
yes
and
marwood
and
three
or
four
more
whom
i
never
saw
before
seeing
me
they
all
put
on
their
grave
faces
whispered
one
another
then
complained
aloud
of
the
vapours
and
after
fell
into
a
profound
silence
fain
they
had
a
mind
to
be
rid
of
you
mira
for
which
reason
i
resolved
not
to
stir
at
last
the
good
old
lady
broke
through
her
painful
taciturnity
with
an
invective
against
long
visits
i
would
not
have
understood
her
but
millamant
joining
in
the
argument
i
rose
and
with
a
constrained
smile
told
her
i
thought
nothing
was
so
easy
as
to
know
when
a
visit
began
to
be
troublesome
she
reddened
and
i
withdrew
without
expecting
her
reply
fain
you
were
to
blame
to
resent
what
she
spoke
only
in
compliance
with
her
aunt
mira
she
is
more
mistress
of
herself
than
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
such
a
resignation
fain
what
though
half
her
fortune
depends
upon
her
marrying
with
my
lady
s
approbation
mira
i
was
then
in
such
a
humour
that
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
if
she
had
been
less
discreet
fain
now
i
remember
i
wonder
not
they
were
weary
of
you
last
night
was
one
of
their
they
have
em
three
times
a
week
and
meet
by
turns
at
one
another
s
apartments
where
they
come
together
like
the
coroner
s
inquest
to
sit
upon
the
murdered
reputations
of
the
week
you
and
i
are
excluded
and
it
was
once
proposed
that
all
the
male
sex
should
be
excepted
but
somebody
moved
that
to
avoid
scandal
there
might
be
one
man
of
the
community
upon
which
motion
witwoud
and
petulant
were
enrolled
members
mira
and
who
may
have
been
the
foundress
of
this
sect
my
lady
wishfort
i
warrant
who
publishes
her
detestation
of
mankind
and
full
of
the
vigour
of
declares
for
a
friend
and
ratafia
and
let
posterity
shift
for
itself
she
ll
breed
no
more
fain
the
discovery
of
your
sham
addresses
to
her
to
conceal
your
love
to
her
niece
has
provoked
this
separation
had
you
dissembled
better
things
might
have
continued
in
the
state
of
nature
mira
i
did
as
much
as
man
could
with
any
reasonable
conscience
i
proceeded
to
the
very
last
act
of
flattery
with
her
and
was
guilty
of
a
song
in
her
commendation
nay
i
got
a
friend
to
put
her
into
a
lampoon
and
compliment
her
with
the
imputation
of
an
affair
with
a
young
fellow
which
i
carried
so
far
that
i
told
her
the
malicious
town
took
notice
that
she
was
grown
fat
of
a
sudden
and
when
she
lay
in
of
a
dropsy
persuaded
her
she
was
reported
to
be
in
labour
the
devil
s
in
t
if
an
old
woman
is
to
be
flattered
further
unless
a
man
should
endeavour
downright
personally
to
debauch
her
and
that
my
virtue
forbade
me
but
for
the
discovery
of
this
amour
i
am
indebted
to
your
friend
or
your
wife
s
friend
marwood
fain
what
should
provoke
her
to
be
your
enemy
unless
she
has
made
you
advances
which
you
have
slighted
women
do
not
easily
forgive
omissions
of
that
nature
mira
she
was
always
civil
to
me
till
of
late
i
confess
i
am
not
one
of
those
coxcombs
who
are
apt
to
interpret
a
woman
s
good
manners
to
her
prejudice
and
think
that
she
who
does
not
refuse
em
everything
can
refuse
em
nothing
fain
you
are
a
gallant
man
mirabell
and
though
you
may
have
cruelty
enough
not
to
satisfy
a
lady
s
longing
you
have
too
much
generosity
not
to
be
tender
of
her
honour
yet
you
speak
with
an
indifference
which
seems
to
be
affected
and
confesses
you
are
conscious
of
a
negligence
mira
you
pursue
the
argument
with
a
distrust
that
seems
to
be
unaffected
and
confesses
you
are
conscious
of
a
concern
for
which
the
lady
is
more
indebted
to
you
than
is
your
wife
fain
fie
fie
friend
if
you
grow
censorious
i
must
leave
you

gamesters

joy
of
your

mirabell
you
look
pleased
mira
ay
i
have
been
engaged
in
a
matter
of
some
sort
of
mirth
which
is
not
yet
ripe
for
discovery
i
am
glad
this
is
not
a
i
wonder
fainall
that
you
who
are
married
and
of
consequence
should
be
discreet
will
suffer
your
wife
to
be
of
such
a
party
fain
faith
i
am
not
jealous
besides
most
who
are
engaged
are
women
and
relations
and
for
the
men
they
are
of
a
kind
too
contemptible
to
give
scandal
mira
i
am
of
another
opinion
the
greater
the
coxcomb
always
the
more
the
scandal
for
a
woman
who
is
not
a
fool
can
have
but
one
reason
for
associating
with
a
man
who
is
one
fain
are
you
jealous
as
often
as
you
see
witwoud
entertained
by
millamant
mira
of
her
understanding
i
am
if
not
of
her
person
fain
you
do
her
wrong
for
to
give
her
her
due
she
has
wit
mira
she
has
beauty
enough
to
make
any
man
think
so
and
complaisance
enough
not
to
contradict
him
who
shall
tell
her
so
fain
for
a
passionate
lover
methinks
you
are
a
man
somewhat
too
discerning
in
the
failings
of
your
mistress
mira
and
for
a
discerning
man
somewhat
too
passionate
a
lover
for
i
like
her
with
all
her
faults
nay
like
her
for
her
faults
her
follies
are
so
natural
or
so
artful
that
they
become
her
and
those
affectations
which
in
another
woman
would
be
odious
serve
but
to
make
her
more
agreeable
i
ll
tell
thee
fainall
she
once
used
me
with
that
insolence
that
in
revenge
i
took
her
to
pieces
sifted
her
and
separated
her
failings
i
studied
em
and
got
em
by
rote
the
catalogue
was
so
large
that
i
was
not
without
hopes
one
day
or
other
to
hate
her
heartily
to
which
end
i
so
used
myself
to
think
of
em
that
at
length
contrary
to
my
design
and
expectation
they
gave
me
every
hour
less
and
less
disturbance
till
in
a
few
days
it
became
habitual
to
me
to
remember
em
without
being
displeased
they
are
now
grown
as
familiar
to
me
as
my
own
frailties
and
in
all
probability
in
a
little
time
longer
i
shall
like
em
as
well
fain
marry
her
marry
her
be
half
as
well
acquainted
with
her
charms
as
you
are
with
her
defects
and
my

on
t
you
are
your
own

say
you

what
is
the

of
that
noble
family
in

sir
wilfull
witwoud
fain
he
is
expected
do
you
know
him
mira
i
have
seen
him
he
promises
to
be
an
extraordinary
person
i
think
you
have
the
honour
to
be
related
to
him
fain
yes
he
is
to
this
witwoud
by
a
former
wife
who
was
sister
to
my
lady
wishfort
my
wife
s
mother
if
you
marry
millamant
you
must
call
cousins
too
mira
i
had
rather
be
his
relation
than
his
acquaintance
fain
he
comes
to
town
in
order
to
equip
himself
for
travel
mira
for
travel
why
the
man
that
i
mean
is
above
forty
fain
no
matter
for
that
tis
for
the
honour
of
england
that
all
europe
should
know
we
have
blockheads
of
all
ages
mira
i
wonder
there
is
not
an
act
of
parliament
to
save
the
credit
of
the
nation
and
prohibit
the
exportation
of
fools
fain
by
no
means
tis
better
as
tis
tis
better
to
trade
with
a
little
loss
than
to
be
quite
eaten
up
with
being
overstocked
mira
pray
are
the
follies
of
this
and
those
of
the
squire
his
brother
anything
related
fain
not
at
all
witwoud
grows
by
the
knight
like
a
medlar
grafted
on
a
crab
one
will
melt
in
your
mouth
and
t
other
set
your
teeth
on
edge
one
is
all
pulp
and
the
other
all
core
mira
so
one
will
be
rotten
before
he
be
ripe
and
the
other
will
be
rotten
without
ever
being
ripe
at
all
fain
sir
wilfull
is
an
odd
mixture
of
bashfulness
and
obstinacy
but
when
he
s
drunk
he
s
as
loving
as
the
monster
in
the
tempest
and
much
after
the
same
manner
to
give
bother
his
due
he
has
something
of
and
does
not
always
want
wit
mira
not
always
but
as
often
as
his
memory
fails
him
and
his
commonplace
of
comparisons
he
is
a
fool
with
a
good
memory
and
some
few
scraps
of
other
folks
wit
he
is
one
whose
conversation
can
never
be
approved
yet
it
is
now
and
then
to
be
endured
he
has
indeed
one
good
quality
he
is
not
exceptious
for
he
so
passionately
affects
the
reputation
of
understanding
raillery
that
he
will
construe
an
affront
into
a
jest
and
call
downright
rudeness
and
ill
language
satire
and
fire
fain
if
you
have
a

to

will
find
mirabell
as
warm
a
rival
as
a
lover
wit
pshaw
pshaw
that
she
laughs
at
petulant
is
plain
and
for
my
part
but
that
it
is
almost
a
fashion
to
admire
her
i
tell
you
a
secret
but
let
it
go
no
further
between
friends
i
shall
never
break
my
heart
for
her
fain
how
wit
she
s
handsome
but
she
s
a
sort
of
an
uncertain
woman
fain
i
thought
you
had
died
for
her
wit
fain
she
has
wit
wit
tis
what
she
will
hardly
allow
anybody
else
now
demme
i
should
hate
that
if
she
were
as
handsome
as
cleopatra
mirabell
is
not
so
sure
of
her
as
he
thinks
for
fain
why
do
you
think
so
wit
we
stayed
pretty
late
there
last
night
and
heard
something
of
an
uncle
to
mirabell
who
is
lately
come
to
town
and
is
between
him
and
the
best
part
of
his
estate
mirabell
and
he
are
at
some
distance
as
my
lady
wishfort
has
been
told
and
you
know
she
hates
mirabell
worse
than
a
quaker
hates
a
parrot
or
than
a
fishmonger
hates
a
hard
frost
whether
this
uncle
has
seen
millamant
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
there
were
items
of
such
a
treaty
being
in
embryo
and
if
it
should
come
to
life
poor
mirabell
would
be
in
some
sort
unfortunately
fobbed
i
faith
fain
tis
impossible
millamant
should
hearken
to
it
wit
faith
my
dear
i
can
t
tell
she
s
a
woman
and
a
kind
of
a
humorist
mira
and
this
is
the
sum
of
what
you
could
collect
last
night
pet
the
quintessence
maybe
witwoud

more
he
stayed
longer
besides
they
never
mind
him

that
i
may
beg

but
one
trouble
with
you

o
rare
petulant

as
quick
as

a
frosty
morning

shalt
to
the
mall
with
us
and
we
ll
be
very
severe
pet
enough
i
m
in
a
humour
to
be
severe
mira
are
you
pray
then
walk
by
yourselves
let
not
us
be
accessory
to
your
putting
the
ladies
out
of
countenance
with
your
senseless
ribaldry
which
you
roar
out
aloud
as
often
as
they
pass
by
you
and
when
you
have
made
a
handsome
woman
blush
then
you
think
you
have
been
severe
pet
what
what
then
let
em
either
show
their
innocence
by
not
understanding
what
they
hear
or
else
show
their
discretion
by
not
hearing
what
they
would
not
be
thought
to
understand
mira
but
hast
not
thou
then
sense
enough
to
know
that
thou
ought
st
to
be
most
ashamed
thyself
when
thou
hast
put
another
out
of
countenance
pet
not
i
by
this
hand
i
always
take
blushing
either
for
a
sign
of
guilt
or
mira
i
confess
you
ought
to
think
so
you
are
in
the
right
that
you
may
plead
the
error
of
your
judgment
in
defence
of
your
practice
where
modesty
s
ill
manners
tis
but
fit
that
impudence
and
malice
pass
for

i
james

fainall
marwood
fain
ay
ay
dear
marwood
if
we
will
be
happy
we
must
find
the
means
in
ourselves
and
among
ourselves
men
are
ever
in
extremes
either
doting
or
averse
while
they
are
lovers
if
they
have
fire
and
sense
their
jealousies
are
insupportable
and
when
they
cease
to
love
we
ought
to
think
at
least
they
loathe
they
look
upon
us
with
horror
and
distaste
they
meet
us
like
the
ghosts
of
what
we
were
and
as
from
such
fly
from
us
mar
true
tis
an
unhappy
circumstance
of
life
that
love
should
ever
die
before
us
and
that
the
man
so
often
should
outlive
the
lover
but
say
what
you
will
tis
better
to
be
left
than
never
to
have
been
loved
to
pass
our
youth
in
dull
indifference
to
refuse
the
sweets
of
life
because
they
once
must
leave
us
is
as
preposterous
as
to
wish
to
have
been
born
old
because
we
one
day
must
be
old
for
my
part
my
youth
may
wear
and
waste
but
it
shall
never
rust
in
my
possession
fain
then
it
seems
you
dissemble
an
aversion
to
mankind
only
in
compliance
to
my
mother
s
humour
mar
certainly
to
be
free
i
have
no
taste
of
those
insipid
dry
discourses
with
which
our
sex
of
force
must
entertain
themselves
apart
from
men
we
may
affect
endearments
to
each
other
profess
eternal
friendships
and
seem
to
dote
like
lovers
but
tis
not
in
our
natures
long
to
persevere
love
will
resume
his
empire
in
our
breasts
and
every
heart
or
soon
or
late
receive
and
readmit
him
as
its
lawful
tyrant
fain
bless
me
how
have
i
been
deceived

you
profess
a
libertine

there

i

thinking
sometimes

my
aversion
further

find
one

loved
me

if

have
him

hate
him
in

i
never
loved

insufferably
proud

by
the
reason
you
give
for

would
think
it
dissembled

laid
a
fault

they
are

they
are
turning
into
the

walk
fain
while
i
only
hated
my
husband
i
could
bear
to
see
him
but
since
i
have
despised
him
he
s
too
offensive
mira
oh
you
should
hate
with
prudence
fain
yes
for
i
have
loved
with
indiscretion
mira
you
should
have
just
so
much
disgust
for
your
husband
as
may
be
sufficient
to
make
you
relish
your
lover
fain
you
have
been
the
cause
that
i
have
loved
without
bounds
and
would
you
set
limits
to
that
aversion
of
which
you
have
been
the
occasion
why
did
you
make
me
marry
this
man
mira
why
do
we
daily
commit
disagreeable
and
dangerous
actions
to
save
that
idol
reputation
if
the
familiarities
of
our
loves
had
produced
that
consequence
of
which
you
were
apprehensive
where
could
you
have
fixed
a
father
s
name
with
credit
but
on
a
husband
i
knew
fainall
to
be
a
man
lavish
of
his
morals
an
interested
and
professing
friend
a
false
and
a
designing
lover
yet
one
whose
wit
and
outward
fair
behaviour
have
gained
a
reputation
with
the
town
enough
to
make
that
woman
stand
excused
who
has
suffered
herself
to
be
won
by
his
addresses
a
better
man
ought
not
to
have
been
sacrificed
to
the
occasion
a
worse
had
not
answered
to
the
purpose
when
you
are
weary
of
him
you
know
your
remedy
fain
i
ought
to
stand
in
some
degree
of
credit
with
you
mirabell
mira
in
justice
to
you
i
have
made
you
privy
to
my
whole
design
and
put
it
in
your
power
to
ruin
or
advance
my
fortune
fain
whom
have
you
instructed
to
represent
your
pretended
uncle
mira
waitwell
my
servant
fain
he
is
an
humble
servant
to
foible
my
mother
s
woman
and
may
win
her
to
your
interest
mira
care
is
taken
for
that
she
is
won
and
worn
by
this
time
they
were
married
this
morning
fain
who
mira
waitwell
and
foible
i
would
not
tempt
my
servant
to
betray
me
by
trusting
him
too
far
if
your
mother
in
hopes
to
ruin
me
should
consent
to
marry
my
pretended
uncle
he
might
like
mosca
in
the
stand
upon
terms
so
i
made
him
sure
beforehand
fain
so
if
my
poor
mother
is
caught
in
a
contract
you
will
discover
the
imposture
betimes
and
release
her
by
producing
a
certificate
of
her
gallant
s
former
marriage
mira
yes
upon
condition
that
she
consent
to
my
marriage
with
her
niece
and
surrender
the
moiety
of
her
fortune
in
her
possession
fain
she
talked
last
night
of
endeavouring
at
a
match
between
millamant
and
your
uncle
mira
that
was
by
foible
s
direction
and
my
instruction
that
she
might
seem
to
carry
it
more
privately
fain
well
i
have
an
opinion
of
your
success
for
i
believe
my
lady
will
do
anything
to
get
an
husband
and
when
she
has
this
which
you
have
provided
for
her
i
suppose
she
will
submit
to
anything
to
get
rid
of
him
mira
yes
i
think
the
good
lady
would
marry
anything
that
resembled
a
man
though
twere
no
more
than
what
a
butler
could
pinch
out
of
a
napkin
fain
female
frailty
we
must
all
come
to
it
if
we
live
to
be
old
and
feel
the
craving
of
a
false
appetite
when
the
true
is
decayed
mira
an
old
woman
s
appetite
is
depraved
like
that
of
a
girl
tis
the
of
a
second
childhood
and
like
the
faint
offer
of
a
latter
spring
serves

to
usher
in
the
fall

affected

i
shall
never
keep
up

not

never

i
shall
swoon
if
he
should
expect

no
i
hope
sir

is
better
bred
than
to
put
a
lady
to
the
necessity
of
breaking
her
forms
i
won
t
be
too
coy
won
t
give
him
despair
but
a
little
disdain
is
not
amiss
a
little
scorn
is
alluring
foib
a
little
scorn
becomes
your

lady
yes

tenderness
becomes
me
sort
of
a
dyingness

foible
scene

fainall
foible
fain
o

i
have
been
in
a
fright
lest

should
come
too
late
that
devil
marwood
saw
you
in
the
park
with
mirabell
and
i
m
afraid
will
discover
it
to
my
lady
foib
discover
what
madam
fain
nay
nay
put
not
on
that
strange
face
i
am
privy
to
the
whole
design
and
know
that
waitwell
to
whom
thou
wert
this
morning
married
is
to
personate
mirabell
s
uncle
and
as
such
winning
my
lady
to
involve
her
in
those
difficulties
from
which
mirabell
only
must
release
her
by
his
making
his
conditions
to
have
my
cousin
and
her
fortune
left
to
her
own
disposal
foib
o
dear
madam
i
beg
your
pardon
it
was
not
my
confidence
in
your
ladyship
that
was
deficient
but
i
thought
the
former
good
correspondence
between
your
ladyship
and
mirabell
might
have
hindered
his
communicating
this
secret
fain
dear
foible
forget
that
foib
o
dear
madam
mirabell
is
such
a
sweet
winning
gentleman
but
your
ladyship
is
the
pattern
of
generosity
sweet
lady
to
be
so
good
mirabell
can
not
choose
but
be
grateful
i
find
your
ladyship
has
his
heart
still
now
madam
i
can
safely
tell
your
ladyship
our
success
marwood
had
told
my
lady
but
i
warrant
i
managed
myself
i
turned
it
all
for
the
better
i
told
my
lady
that
mirabell
railed
at
her
i
laid
horrid
things
to
his
charge
i
ll
vow
and
my
lady
is
so
incensed
that
she
ll
be
contracted
to
sir
rowland
she
says
i
warrant
i
worked
her
up
that
he
may
have
her
for
asking
for
as
they
say
of
a
welsh
maidenhead
fain
o
rare
foible
foib
madam
i
beg
your
ladyship
to
acquaint
mirabell
of
his
success
i
would
be
seen
as
little
as
possible
to
speak
to
i
believe
madam
marwood
watches
me
she
has
a
month
s
mind
but
i
know
mirabell
can
t
abide
her
john
remove
my
lady

go
with
you
up
the
back
stairs

i
should

you

it
so
swimmingly
i
thought
there
was
something
in
it
but
it
seems
it
s
over
with
you
your
loathing
is
not
from
a
want
of
appetite
then
but
from
a
surfeit
else
you
could
never
be
so
cool
to
fall
from
a
principal
to
be
an
assistant
to
procure
for
him
a

in

without
you

have
kept
his

closer
i
shall
not
prove
another

of

he
has
not
obliged
me
to
that
with
those
excesses
of
himself
and
now
i

have
none

might
as

put

what

no
more
a

it
is
a

could
laugh
immoderately
poor

his
constancy
to
me
has
quite
destroyed
his
complaisance
for
all
the

i
swear
i
never
enjoined
it
him
to
be
so
coy
if
i
had
the
vanity
to
think
he
would
obey
me
i
would
command
him
to
show
more
gallantry
tis
hardly
to
be
so
particular
on

hand

so
insensible
on
the

i
despair
to
prevail
and
so
let
him
follow

what

your

you

it
a
thing
impossible

expires

wastes

ii
tis
not
to
wound
a
wanton

rous

gives

tis
the

at

of

i

i
wonder
at

why
should
a

be
any
further

not
modish
to

slabber

you

a
fop
dear

sheart
i
ve
suspected
r

i
conjectured
you
were
a
fop
since
you
began
to
change
the
style
of
your
letters
and
write
in
a
scrap
of
paper
gilt
round
the
edges
no
bigger
than
a
subpoena
i
might
expect
this
when
you
left

honoured

hoping
you
are
in
good
health
and
so
forth
to
begin
with
a
rat
me
knight
i
m
so
sick
of
a
last

ods
heart
and
then
tell
a
familiar
tale
of
a
cock
and
a
bull
and
a
whore
and
a
bottle
and
so
conclude
you
could
write
news
before
you
were
out
of
your

when
you
lived
with
honest
the
attorney
of
furnival
s

you

if

feltmaker
in

this

would
have
bound
me
to
a
maker
of

better
than

made
that
fond
discovery
that

been
forfeited
had
they
been

my

had
added
lustre
to
my
horns
by
that
increase
of
fortune
i
could
have
worn
em
tipt
with
gold
though
my

had
been
furnished
like
a

mar
they
may
prove
a
cap
of
maintenance
to
you
still
if
you
can
away
with
your

and
she
s
no
worse
than
when
you
had
her
dare
swear
she
had
given
up
her
game
before
she
was
married
fain
hum
that
may
mar
you
married
her
to
keep
you
and
if
you
can
contrive
to
have
her
keep
you
better
than
you
expected
why
should
you
not
keep
her
longer
than
you
intended
fain
the
means
the
means
mar
discover
to
my
lady
your
wife
s
conduct
threaten
to
part
with
her
my
lady
loves
her
and
will
come
to
any
composition
to
save
her
reputation
take
the
opportunity
of
breaking
it
just
upon
the
discovery
of
this
imposture
my
lady
will
be
enraged
beyond
bounds
and
sacrifice
niece
and
fortune
and
all
at
that
conjuncture
and
let
me
alone
to
keep
her
warm
if
she
should
flag
in
her
part
i
will
not
fail
to
prompt
her
fain
faith
this
has
an
appearance
mar
i
m
sorry
i
hinted
to
my
lady
to
endeavour
a
match
between
millamant
and
sir
wilfull
that
may
be
an
obstacle
fain
oh
for
that
matter
leave
me
to
manage
him
i
ll
disable
him
for
that
he
will
drink
like
a
dane
after
dinner
i
ll
set
his
hand
in
mar
well
how
do
you
stand
affected
towards
your
lady
fain
why
faith
i
m
thinking
of
it
let
me
see
i
am
married
already
so
that
s
over
my
wife
has
played
the
jade
with
me
well
that
s
over
too
i
never
loved
her
or
if
i
had
why
that
would
have
been
over
too
by
this
time
jealous
of
her
i
can
not
be
for
i
am
certain
so
there
s
an
end
of
jealousy
weary
of
her
i
am
and
shall
be
no
there
s
no
end
of
that
no
no
that
were
too
much
to
hope
thus
far
concerning
my
repose
now
for
my
reputation
as
to
my
own
i
married
not
for
it
so
that
s
out
of
the
question
and
as
to
my
part
in
my
wife
she
had
parted
with
hers
before
so
bringing
none
to
me
she
can
take
none
from
me
tis
against
all
rule
of
play
that
i
should
lose
to
one
who
has
not
wherewithal
to
stake
mar
besides
you
forget
marriage
is
honourable
fain
hum
faith
and
that
s
well
thought
on
marriage
is
honourable
as
you
say
and
if
so
wherefore
should
cuckoldom
be
a
discredit
being
derived
from
so
honourable
a
root
mar
nay
i
know
not
if
the
root
be
honourable
why
not
the
branches
fain
so
so
why
this
point
s
clear
well
how
do
we
proceed
mar
i
will
contrive
a
letter
which
shall
be
delivered
to
my
lady
at
the
time
when
that
rascal
who
is
to
act
sir
rowland
is
with
her
it
shall
come
as
from
an
unknown
the
less
i
appear
to
know
of
the
truth
the
better
i
can
play
the
incendiary
besides
i
would
not
have
foible
provoked
if
i
could
help
it
because
you
know
she
knows
some
passages
nay
i
expect
all
will
come
out
but
let
the
mine
be
sprung
first
and
then
i
care
not
if
i
am
discovered
fain
if
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
i
ll
turn
my
wife
to
grass
i
have
already
a
deed
of
settlement
of
the
best
part
of
her
estate
which
i
wheedled
out
of
her
and
that
you
shall
partake
at
least
mar
i
hope
you
are
convinced
that
i
hate
mirabell
now
you
ll
be
no
more
jealous
fain
jealous
no
by
this
kiss
let
husbands
be
jealous
but
let
the
lover
still
believe
or
if
he
doubt
let
it
be
only
to
endear
his
pleasure
and
prepare
the
joy
that
follows
when
he
proves
his
mistress
true
but
let
husbands
doubts
convert
to
endless
jealousy
or
if
they
have
belief
let
it
corrupt
to
superstition
and
blind
credulity
i
am
single
and
will
herd
no
more
with
em
true
i
wear
the
badge
but
i
ll
disown
the
order
and
since
i
take
my
leave
of
em
i
care
not
if
i
leave
em
a
common
motto
to
their
common
crest
all
husbands
must
or
pain
or
shame
endure
the

no

am
rous
boy
scene
millamant
mirabell
mira
like
daphne
she
as
lovely
and
as
coy
do
you
lock
yourself
up
from
me
to
make
my
search
more
curious
or
is
this
pretty
artifice
contrived
to
signify
that
here
the
chase
must
end
and
my
pursuit
be
crowned
for
you
can
fly
no
further
milla
vanity
ll
fly
and
be
followed
to
the
last
moment
though
i
am
upon
the
very
verge
of
matrimony
i
expect
you
should
solicit
me
as
much
as
if
i
were
wavering
at
the
grate
of
a
monastery
with
one
foot
over
the
threshold
i
ll
be
solicited
to
the
very
last
nay
and
afterwards
mira
what
after
the
last
milla
oh
i
should
think
i
was
poor
and
had
nothing
to
bestow
if
i
were
reduced
to
an
inglorious
ease
and
freed
from
the
agreeable
fatigues
of
solicitation
mira
but
do
not
you
know
that
when
favours
are
conferred
upon
instant
and
tedious
solicitation
that
they
diminish
in
their
value
and
that
both
the
giver
loses
the
grace
and
the
receiver
lessens
his
pleasure
milla
it
may
be
in
things
of
common
application
but
never
sure
in
love
oh
i
hate
a
lover
that
can
dare
to
think
he
draws
a
moment
s
air
independent
on
the
bounty
of
his
mistress
there
is
not
so
impudent
a
thing
in
nature
as
the
saucy
look
of
an
assured
man
confident
of
success
the
pedantic
arrogance
of
a
very
husband
has
not
so
pragmatical
an
air
ah
i
ll
never
marry
unless
i
am
first
made
sure
of
my
will
and
pleasure
mira
would
you
have
em
both
before
marriage
or
will
you
be
contented
with
the
first
now
and
stay
for
the
other
till
after
grace
milla
ah
don
t
be
impertinent
my
dear
liberty
shall
i
leave
thee
my
faithful
solitude
my
darling
contemplation

i
bid
you

adieu
adieu

i

know
what
to
think
and
i
promise
you
her
education
has
been
unexceptionable
i
may
say
it
for
i
chiefly
made
it
my
own
care
to
initiate
her
very
infancy
in
the
rudiments
of
virtue
and
to
impress
upon
her
tender
years
a
young
odium
and
aversion
to
the
very
sight
of
men
ay
friend
she
would
ha
shrieked
if
she
had
but
seen
a
man
till
she
was
in
her
teens
as
i
m
a
person
tis
true
she
was
never
suffered
to
play
with
a
male
child
though
but
in
coats
nay
her
very
babies
were
of
the
feminine
gender
oh
she
never
looked
a
man
in
the
face
but
her
own
father
or
the
chaplain
and
him
we
made
a
shift
to
put
upon
her
for
a
woman
by
the
help
of
his
long
garments
and
his
sleek
face
till
she
was
going
in
her
fifteen
mar
twas
much
she
should
be
deceived
so
long
lady
i
warrant
you
or
she
would
never
have
borne
to
have
been
catechised
by
him
and
have
heard
his
long
lectures
against
singing
and
dancing
and
such
debaucheries
and
going
to
filthy
plays
and
profane
music
meetings
where
the
lewd
trebles
squeak
nothing
but
bawdy
and
the
basses
roar
blasphemy
oh
she
would
have
swooned
at
the
sight
or
name
of
an
obscene
can
i
think
after
all
this
that
my
daughter
can
be
naught
what
a
whore
and
thought
it
excommunication
to
set
her
foot
within
the
door
of
a
playhouse
o
dear
friend
i
can
t
believe
it

what
and
have
your

prostituted
in
a
public
court
yours

your

s
reputation
worried
at
the
bar
by
a
pack
of
bawling
lawyers
to
be
ushered
in
with
an
of
scandal
and
have
your
case
opened
by
an
old
fumbling
leacher
in
a
quoif
like
a
man
midwife
to
bring
your
daughter
s
infamy
to
light
to
be
a
theme
for
legal
punsters
and
quibblers
by
the
statute
and
become
a
jest
against
a
rule
of
court
where
there
is
no
precedent
for
a
jest
in
any
record
not
even
in
doomsday
book
to
discompose
the
gravity
of
the
bench
and
provoke
naughty
interrogatories
in
more
naughty
law
latin
while
the
good
judge
tickled
with
the
proceeding
simpers
under
a
grey
beard
and
fidges
off

on
his
cushion
as
if
he
had
swallowed
cantharides

sate
upon

tis
very
hard
mar
and
then
to
have
my
young
revellers

prentices
at
a
conventicle
and
after
talk
it
over
again
in

before
drawers
in
an
lady
worse

worse
mar
nay
this
is
nothing

means
well
managed

marriage
frauds
too
oft

in
kind
epilogue
spoken
by
bracegirdle
after
our
epilogue
this
crowd
dismisses
i
m
thinking
how
this
play
ll
be
pulled
to
pieces
but
pray
consider
e
er
you
doom
its
fall
how
hard
a
thing
twould
be
to
please
you
all
there
are
some
critics
so
with
spleen
diseased
they
scarcely
come
inclining
to
be
pleased
and
sure
he
must
have
more
than
mortal
skill
who
pleases
anyone
against
his
will
then
all
bad
poets
we
are
sure
are
foes
and
how
their
number
s
swelled
the
town
well
knows
in
shoals
i
ve
marked
em
judging
in
the
pit
though
they
re
on
no
pretence
for
judgment
fit
but
that
they
have
been
damned
for
want
of
wit
since
when
they
by
their
own
offences
taught
set
up
for
spies
on
plays
and
finding
fault
others
there
are
whose
malice
we
d
prevent
such
who
watch
plays
with
scurrilous
intent
to
mark
out
who
by
characters
are
meant
and
though
no
perfect
likeness
they
can
trace
yet
each
pretends
to
know
the
copied
face
these
with
false
glosses
feed
their
own
and
turn
to
libel
what
was
meant
a
satire
may
such
malicious
fops
this
fortune
find
to
think
themselves
alone
the
fools
designed
if
any
are
so
arrogantly
vain
to
think
they
singly
can
support
a
scene
and
furnish
fool
enough
to
entertain
for
well
the
learned
and
the
judicious
know
that
satire
scorns
to
stoop
so
meanly
low
as
any
one
abstracted
fop
to
show
for
as
when
painters
form
a
matchless
face
they
from
each
fair
one
catch
some
diff
rent
grace
and
shining
features
in
one
portrait
blend
to
which
no
single
beauty
must
pretend
so
poets
oft
do
in
one
piece
expose
whole
of
coquettes
and
beaux
