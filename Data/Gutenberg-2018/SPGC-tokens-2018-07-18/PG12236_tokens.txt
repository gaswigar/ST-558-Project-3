albans
vermont
is
near
the
eastern
shore
of
lake
champlain
and
only
a
short
distance
south
of
north
degrees
which
separates
the
united
states
from
canada
and
some
sixty
or
seventy
miles
from
the
great
lawrence
river
and
the
city
of
montreal
near
here
it
was
on
april
i
was
born
so
the
record
says
and
from
this
point
with
wondering
eyes
of
childhood
i
looked
across
the
waters
of
the
narrow
lake
to
the
slopes
of
the
adirondack
mountains
in
new
york
green
as
the
hills
of
my
own
green
mountain
state
the
parents
of
my
father
were
english
people
and
lived
near
hartford
connecticut
where
he
was
born
while
still
a
little
boy
he
came
with
his
parents
to
vermont
my
mother
maiden
name
was
calkins
born
near
albans
of
welch
parents
and
being
left
an
orphan
while
yet
in
very
tender
years
she
was
given
away
to
be
reared
by
people
who
provided
food
and
clothes
but
permitted
her
to
grow
up
to
womanhood
without
knowing
how
to
read
or
write
after
her
marriage
she
learned
to
do
both
and
acquired
the
rudiments
of
an
education
grandfather
and
his
boys
four
in
all
fairly
carved
a
farm
out
of
the
big
forest
that
covered
the
cold
rocky
hills
giant
work
it
was
for
them
in
such
heavy
timber
pine
hemlock
maple
beech
and
birch
the
clearing
of
a
single
acre
being
a
man
work
for
a
year
the
place
where
the
maples
were
thickest
was
reserved
for
a
sugar
grove
and
from
it
was
made
all
of
the
sweet
material
they
needed
and
some
besides
economy
of
the
very
strictest
kind
had
to
be
used
in
every
direction
main
strength
and
muscle
were
the
only
things
dispensed
in
plenty
the
crops
raised
consisted
of
a
small
flint
corn
rye
oats
potatoes
and
turnips
three
cows
ten
or
twelve
sheep
a
few
pigs
and
a
yoke
of
strong
oxen
comprised
the
live
stock
horses
they
had
none
for
many
years
a
great
was
the
only
wheeled
vehicle
on
the
place
and
this
in
winter
gave
place
to
a
heavy
sled
the
runners
cut
from
a
tree
having
a
natural
crook
and
roughly
but
strongly
made
in
summer
there
were
plenty
of
strawberries
raspberries
whortleberries
and
blackberries
growing
wild
but
all
the
cultivated
fruit
was
apples
as
these
ripened
many
were
peeled
by
hand
cut
in
quarters
strung
on
long
strings
of
twine
and
dried
before
the
kitchen
fire
for
winter
use
they
had
a
way
of
burying
up
some
of
the
best
keepers
in
the
ground
and
opening
the
apple
hole
was
quite
an
event
of
early
spring
the
children
were
taught
to
work
as
soon
as
large
enough
i
remember
they
furnished
me
with
a
little
wooden
fork
to
spread
the
heavy
swath
of
grass
my
father
cut
with
easy
swings
of
the
scythe
and
when
it
was
dry
and
being
loaded
on
the
great
i
followed
closely
with
a
rake
gathering
every
scattering
spear
the
barn
was
built
so
that
every
animal
was
housed
comfortably
in
winter
and
the
house
was
such
as
all
settlers
built
not
considered
handsome
but
capable
of
being
made
very
warm
in
winter
and
the
great
piles
of
hard
wood
in
the
yard
enough
to
last
as
fuel
for
a
year
not
only
helped
to
clear
the
land
but
kept
us
comfortable
mother
and
the
girls
washed
carded
spun
and
wove
the
wool
from
our
own
sheep
into
good
strong
cloth
flax
was
also
raised
and
i
remember
how
they
pulled
it
rotted
it
by
spreading
on
the
green
meadow
then
broke
and
dressed
it
and
then
the
women
made
linen
cloth
of
various
degrees
of
fineness
quality
and
beauty
thus
by
the
labor
of
both
men
and
women
we
were
clothed
if
an
extra
fine
sunday
dress
was
desired
part
of
the
yarn
was
colored
and
from
this
they
managed
to
get
up
a
very
nice
plaid
goods
for
the
purpose
in
clearing
the
land
the
hemlock
bark
was
peeled
and
traded
off
at
the
tannery
for
leather
or
used
to
pay
for
tanning
and
dressing
the
hide
of
an
ox
or
cow
which
they
managed
to
fat
and
kill
about
every
year
stores
for
the
family
were
either
made
by
a
neighboring
or
by
a
traveling
one
who
went
from
house
to
house
making
up
a
supply
for
the
family
whipping
the
cat
they
called
it
then
they
paid
him
in
something
or
other
produced
upon
the
farm
and
no
money
was
asked
or
expected
wood
was
one
thing
plenty
and
the
fireplace
was
made
large
enough
to
take
in
sticks
four
feet
long
or
more
for
the
more
they
could
burn
the
better
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
in
an
outhouse
also
provided
with
a
fireplace
and
chimney
they
made
shingles
during
the
long
winter
evenings
the
shavings
making
plenty
of
fire
and
light
by
which
to
work
the
shingles
sold
for
about
a
dollar
a
thousand
just
beside
the
fireplace
in
the
house
was
a
large
brick
oven
where
mother
baked
great
loaves
of
bread
big
pots
of
pork
and
beans
mince
pies
and
loaf
cake
a
big
turkey
or
a
young
pig
on
grand
occasions
many
of
the
dishes
used
were
of
tin
or
pewter
the
milk
pans
were
of
earthenware
but
most
things
about
the
house
in
the
line
of
furniture
were
of
domestic
manufacture
the
store
bills
were
very
light
a
little
tea
for
father
and
mother
a
few
spices
and
odd
luxuries
were
about
all
and
they
were
paid
for
with
surplus
eggs
my
father
and
my
uncle
had
a
sawmill
and
in
winter
they
hauled
logs
to
it
and
could
sell
timber
for
per
thousand
feet
the
school
was
taught
in
winter
by
a
man
named
bowen
who
managed
forty
scholars
and
considered
sixteen
dollars
a
month
boarding
himself
was
pretty
fair
pay
in
summer
some
smart
girl
would
teach
the
small
scholars
and
board
round
among
the
families
when
the
proper
time
came
the
property
holder
would
send
off
to
the
collector
an
itemized
list
of
all
his
property
and
at
another
the
taxes
fell
due
a
farmer
who
would
value
his
property
at
two
thousand
or
three
thousand
dollars
would
find
he
had
to
pay
about
six
or
seven
dollars
all
the
money
in
use
then
seemed
to
be
silver
and
not
very
much
of
that
the
whole
plan
seemed
to
be
to
have
every
family
and
farm
as
far
as
possible
i
have
heard
of
a
note
being
given
payable
in
a
good
cow
to
be
delivered
at
a
certain
time
say
october
and
on
that
day
it
would
pass
from
house
to
house
in
payment
of
a
debt
and
at
night
only
the
last
man
in
the
list
would
have
a
cow
more
than
his
neighbor
yet
those
were
the
days
of
real
independence
after
all
every
man
worked
hard
from
early
youth
to
a
good
old
age
there
were
no
millionaires
no
tramps
and
the
poorhouse
had
only
a
few
inmates
i
have
very
pleasant
recollections
of
the
neighborhood
cider
mill
there
were
two
rollers
formed
of
logs
carefully
rounded
and
four
or
five
feet
long
set
closely
together
in
an
upright
position
in
a
rough
frame
a
long
crooked
sweep
coming
from
one
of
them
to
which
a
horse
was
hitched
and
pulled
it
round
and
round
one
roller
had
mortices
in
it
and
projecting
wooden
teeth
on
the
other
fitted
into
these
so
that
as
they
both
slowly
turned
together
the
apples
were
crushed
a
huge
box
of
coarse
slats
notched
and
locked
together
at
the
corners
held
a
vast
pile
of
the
crushed
apples
while
clean
rye
straw
was
added
to
strain
the
flowing
juice
and
keep
the
cheese
from
spreading
too
much
then
the
ponderous
screw
and
streams
of
delicious
cider
sucking
cider
through
a
long
rye
straw
inserted
in
the
of
a
barrel
was
just
the
best
of
fun
and
cider
taken
that
way
awful
good
while
it
was
new
and
sweet
the
winter
ashes
made
from
burning
so
much
fuel
and
gathered
from
the
and
were
carefully
saved
and
traded
with
the
potash
men
for
potash
or
sold
for
a
small
price
nearly
every
one
went
barefoot
in
summer
and
in
winter
wore
heavy
leather
moccasins
made
by
the
canadian
french
who
lived
near
by
chapter
ii
about
people
began
to
talk
about
the
far
west
ohio
was
the
place
we
heard
most
about
and
the
most
we
knew
was
that
it
was
a
long
way
off
and
no
way
to
get
there
except
over
a
long
and
tedious
road
with
oxen
or
horses
and
a
cart
or
wagon
more
than
one
got
the
western
fever
as
they
called
it
my
uncle
james
webster
and
my
father
among
the
rest
when
they
heard
some
traveler
tell
about
the
fine
country
he
had
seen
so
they
sold
their
farms
and
decided
to
go
to
ohio
uncle
james
was
to
go
ahead
in
the
fall
of
and
get
a
farm
to
rent
if
he
could
and
father
and
his
family
were
to
come
on
the
next
spring
uncle
fitted
out
with
two
good
horses
and
a
wagon
goods
were
packed
in
a
large
box
made
to
fit
and
under
the
wagon
seat
was
the
commissary
chest
for
food
and
bedding
for
daily
use
all
snugly
arranged
father
had
shortly
before
bought
a
fine
morgan
mare
and
a
light
wagon
which
served
as
a
family
carriage
having
wooden
axles
and
a
seat
arranged
on
wooden
springs
and
they
finally
decided
they
would
let
me
take
the
horse
and
wagon
and
go
on
with
uncle
and
father
and
mother
would
come
by
water
either
by
way
of
the
lawrence
river
and
the
lakes
or
by
way
of
the
new
canal
recently
built
which
would
take
them
as
far
as
buffalo
so
they
loaded
up
the
little
wagon
with
some
of
the
mentioned
things
and
articles
in
the
house
among
which
i
remember
a
fine
brass
kettle
considered
almost
indispensable
in
housekeeping
there
was
a
good
lot
of
bedding
and
blankets
and
a
quilt
nicely
folded
was
placed
on
the
spring
seat
as
a
cushion
as
may
be
imagined
i
was
the
object
of
a
great
deal
of
attention
about
this
time
for
a
boy
not
yet
ten
years
old
just
setting
out
into
a
region
almost
unknown
was
a
little
unusual
when
i
was
ready
they
all
gathered
round
to
say
good
bye
and
my
good
mother
seemed
most
concerned
she
said
now
you
must
be
a
good
boy
till
we
come
in
the
spring
mind
uncle
and
aunt
and
take
good
care
of
the
horse
and
remember
us
may
god
protect
you
she
embraced
me
and
kissed
me
and
held
me
till
she
was
exhausted
then
they
lifted
me
up
into
the
spring
seat
put
the
lines
in
my
hand
and
handed
me
my
little
whip
with
a
leather
strip
for
a
lash
just
at
the
last
moment
father
handed
me
a
purse
containing
about
a
dollar
all
in
copper
cents
pennies
we
called
them
then
uncle
had
started
on
they
had
kept
me
so
long
but
i
started
up
and
they
all
followed
me
along
the
road
for
a
mile
or
so
before
we
finally
separated
and
they
turned
back
they
waved
hats
and
handkerchiefs
till
out
of
sight
as
they
returned
and
i
wondered
if
we
should
ever
meet
again
i
was
up
with
uncle
very
soon
and
we
rolled
down
through
albans
and
took
our
road
southerly
along
in
sight
of
lake
champlain
uncle
and
aunt
often
looked
back
to
talk
to
me
see
what
a
nice
cornfield
or
what
nice
apples
on
those
trees
seeming
to
think
they
must
do
all
they
could
to
cheer
me
up
that
i
might
not
think
too
much
of
the
playmates
and
home
i
was
leaving
behind
i
had
never
driven
very
far
before
but
i
found
the
horse
knew
more
than
i
did
how
to
get
around
the
big
stones
and
stumps
that
were
found
in
the
road
so
that
as
long
as
i
held
the
lines
and
the
whip
in
hand
i
was
an
excellent
driver
we
had
made
plans
and
preparations
to
board
ourselves
on
the
journey
we
always
stopped
at
the
farm
houses
over
night
and
they
were
so
hospitable
that
they
gave
us
all
we
wanted
free
our
supper
was
generally
of
bread
and
milk
the
latter
always
furnished
gratuitously
and
i
do
not
recollect
that
we
were
ever
turned
away
from
any
house
where
we
asked
shelter
there
were
no
hotels
or
taverns
as
they
called
them
outside
of
the
towns
in
due
time
we
reached
whitehall
at
the
head
of
lake
champlain
and
the
big
box
in
uncle
wagon
proved
so
heavy
over
the
muddy
roads
that
he
put
it
in
a
canal
boat
to
be
sent
on
to
cleveland
and
we
found
it
much
easier
after
this
for
there
were
too
many
stumps
and
stones
and
log
bridges
for
so
heavy
a
load
as
he
had
our
road
many
times
after
this
led
along
near
the
canal
the
champlain
or
the
erie
and
i
had
a
chance
to
see
something
of
the
canal
boys
life
the
boy
who
drove
the
horses
that
drew
the
packet
boat
was
a
well
dressed
fellow
and
always
rode
at
a
full
trot
or
a
gallop
but
the
freight
driver
was
generally
ragged
and
barefoot
and
walked
when
it
was
too
cold
to
ride
threw
stones
or
clubs
at
his
team
and
cursed
and
abused
the
who
passed
as
long
as
he
was
in
hearing
reared
as
i
had
been
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
wicked
part
of
the
world
we
were
coming
to
we
passed
one
village
of
low
cheap
houses
near
the
canal
the
men
about
were
very
vulgar
and
talked
rough
and
loud
nearly
every
one
with
a
pipe
and
poorly
dressed
loafing
around
the
saloon
apparently
the
worse
for
whisky
the
children
were
barefoot
bare
headed
and
scantly
dressed
and
it
seemed
awfully
dirty
about
the
doors
of
the
shanties
pigs
ducks
and
geese
were
at
the
very
door
and
the
women
i
saw
wore
dresses
that
did
not
come
down
very
near
the
mud
and
big
brogan
shoes
and
their
talk
was
saucy
and
different
from
what
i
had
ever
heard
women
use
before
they
told
me
they
were
irish
people
the
first
i
had
ever
seen
it
was
along
here
somewhere
that
i
lost
my
little
whip
and
to
get
another
one
made
sad
inroads
into
the
little
purse
of
pennies
my
father
gave
me
we
traveled
slowly
on
day
after
day
there
was
no
use
to
hurry
for
we
could
not
do
it
the
roads
were
muddy
the
log
ways
very
rough
and
the
only
way
was
to
take
a
moderate
gait
and
keep
it
we
never
traveled
on
sunday
one
saturday
evening
my
uncle
secured
the
privilege
of
staying
at
a
do
farmer
house
until
monday
we
had
our
own
food
and
bedding
but
were
glad
to
get
some
privileges
in
the
kitchen
and
some
fresh
milk
or
vegetables
after
all
had
taken
supper
that
night
they
all
sat
down
and
made
themselves
quiet
with
their
books
and
the
children
were
as
still
as
mice
till
an
early
bed
time
when
all
retired
when
sunday
evening
came
the
women
got
out
their
work
their
sewing
and
their
knitting
and
the
children
romped
and
played
and
made
as
much
noise
as
they
could
seeming
as
anxious
to
break
the
sabbath
as
they
had
been
to
have
a
pious
saturday
night
i
had
never
seen
that
way
before
and
asked
my
uncle
who
said
he
guessed
they
were
seventh
day
baptists
after
many
days
of
travel
which
became
to
me
quite
monotonous
we
came
to
cleveland
on
lake
erie
and
here
my
uncle
found
his
box
of
goods
loaded
it
into
the
wagon
again
and
traveled
on
through
rain
and
mud
making
very
slow
headway
for
two
or
three
days
after
when
we
stopped
at
a
in
medina
county
they
told
us
we
were
only
miles
from
cleveland
here
was
a
small
town
consisting
of
a
hotel
store
church
schoolhouse
and
blacksmith
shop
and
as
it
was
getting
cold
and
bad
uncle
decided
to
go
no
farther
now
and
rented
a
room
for
himself
and
aunt
and
found
a
place
for
me
to
lodge
with
daniel
stevens
boy
close
by
we
got
good
stables
for
our
horses
i
went
to
the
district
school
here
and
studied
reading
spelling
and
colburn
mental
arithmetic
which
i
mastered
it
began
very
easy
how
many
thumbs
on
your
right
hand
how
many
on
your
left
how
many
altogether
but
it
grew
harder
further
on
uncle
took
employment
at
anything
he
could
find
to
do
chopping
was
his
principal
occupation
when
the
snow
began
to
go
off
he
looked
around
for
a
farm
to
rent
for
us
and
father
to
live
on
when
he
came
but
he
found
none
such
as
he
needed
he
now
got
a
letter
from
father
telling
him
that
he
had
good
news
from
a
friend
named
cornish
who
said
that
good
land
nearly
clear
of
timber
could
be
bought
of
the
government
in
michigan
territory
some
sixty
or
seventy
miles
beyond
detroit
and
this
being
an
opportunity
to
get
land
they
needed
with
their
small
capital
they
would
start
for
that
place
as
soon
as
the
were
thawed
out
probably
in
april
we
then
gave
up
the
idea
of
staying
here
and
prepared
to
go
to
michigan
as
soon
as
the
frost
was
out
of
the
ground
starting
we
reached
huron
river
to
find
it
swollen
and
out
of
its
bank
giving
us
much
trouble
to
get
across
the
road
along
the
bottom
lands
being
partly
covered
with
logs
and
rails
but
once
across
we
were
in
the
town
and
when
we
enquired
about
the
road
around
to
detroit
they
said
the
country
was
all
a
swamp
and
miles
wide
and
in
spring
impassible
they
called
it
the
maumee
or
black
swamp
we
were
advised
to
go
by
water
when
a
steamboat
came
up
the
river
bound
for
detroit
we
put
our
wagons
and
horses
on
board
and
camped
on
the
lower
deck
ourselves
we
had
our
own
food
and
were
very
comfortable
and
glad
to
have
escaped
the
great
mudhole
chapter
iii
we
arrived
in
detroit
safely
and
a
few
minutes
answered
to
land
our
wagons
and
goods
when
we
rolled
outward
in
a
westerly
direction
we
found
a
very
muddy
roads
stumps
and
log
bridges
plenty
making
our
rate
of
travel
very
slow
when
out
upon
our
road
about
miles
near
ypsilanti
the
thick
forest
we
had
been
passing
through
grew
thinner
and
the
trees
soon
dwindled
down
into
what
they
called
oak
openings
and
the
road
became
more
sandy
when
we
reached
mccracken
tavern
we
began
to
enquire
for
ebenezer
manley
and
family
and
were
soon
directed
to
a
large
house
near
by
where
he
was
stopping
for
a
time
we
drove
up
to
the
door
and
they
all
came
out
to
see
who
the
new
comers
were
mother
saw
me
first
and
ran
to
the
wagon
and
pulled
me
off
and
hugged
and
kissed
me
over
and
over
again
while
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
then
she
would
hold
me
off
at
arm
length
and
look
me
in
the
eye
and
say
i
am
so
glad
to
have
you
again
and
then
she
embraced
me
again
and
again
you
are
our
little
man
said
she
you
have
come
over
this
long
road
and
brought
us
our
good
horse
and
our
little
wagon
my
sister
polly
two
years
older
than
i
stood
patiently
by
and
when
mother
turned
to
speak
to
uncle
and
aunt
she
locked
arms
with
me
and
took
me
away
with
her
we
had
never
been
separated
before
in
all
our
lives
and
we
had
loved
each
other
as
good
children
should
who
have
been
brought
up
in
good
and
moral
principles
we
loved
each
other
and
our
home
and
respected
our
good
father
and
mother
who
had
made
it
so
happy
for
us
we
all
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
house
and
talked
pretty
fast
telling
our
experience
on
our
long
journey
by
land
and
water
and
when
the
sun
went
down
we
were
called
to
supper
and
went
hand
in
hand
to
surround
the
bountiful
table
as
a
family
again
during
the
conversation
at
supper
father
said
to
me
lewis
i
have
bought
you
a
smooth
bore
rifle
suitable
for
either
ball
or
shot
this
i
thought
was
good
enough
for
any
one
and
i
thanked
him
heartily
we
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
talking
over
our
adventures
since
we
left
vermont
and
sleep
was
forgotten
by
young
and
old
next
morning
father
and
uncle
took
the
horse
and
little
wagon
and
went
out
in
search
of
government
land
they
found
an
old
acquaintance
in
jackson
county
and
government
land
all
around
him
and
searching
till
they
found
the
section
corner
they
found
the
number
of
the
lots
they
wanted
to
locate
on
acres
in
all
they
then
went
to
the
detroit
land
office
and
secured
the
pieces
they
had
chosen
father
now
bought
a
yoke
of
oxen
a
wagon
and
a
cow
and
as
soon
as
we
could
get
loaded
up
our
little
emigrant
train
started
west
to
our
future
home
where
we
arrived
safely
in
a
few
days
and
secured
a
house
to
live
in
about
a
mile
away
from
our
land
we
now
worked
with
a
will
and
built
two
log
houses
and
also
hired
acres
broken
which
was
done
with
three
or
four
yoke
of
oxen
and
a
strong
plow
the
trees
were
scattered
over
the
ground
and
some
small
brush
and
old
limbs
and
logs
which
we
cleared
away
as
we
plowed
our
houses
went
up
very
fast
all
rough
oak
logs
with
oak
puncheons
or
hewed
planks
for
a
floor
and
oak
shakes
for
a
roof
all
of
our
own
make
the
shakes
were
held
down
upon
the
roof
by
heavy
poles
for
we
had
no
nails
the
door
of
split
stuff
hung
with
wooden
hinges
and
the
fire
place
of
stone
laid
up
with
the
logs
and
from
the
loft
floor
upward
the
chimney
was
built
of
split
stuff
plastered
heavily
with
mud
we
have
a
small
window
in
the
house
we
then
built
a
log
barn
for
our
oxen
cow
and
horse
and
got
pigs
sheep
and
chickens
as
fast
as
a
chance
offered
as
fast
as
possible
we
fenced
in
the
cultivated
land
father
and
uncle
splitting
out
the
rails
while
a
younger
brother
and
myself
by
each
getting
hold
of
an
end
of
one
of
them
managed
to
lay
up
a
fence
four
rails
high
all
we
small
men
could
do
thus
working
on
we
had
a
pretty
well
cultivated
farm
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
years
on
which
we
produced
wheat
corn
and
potatoes
and
had
an
excellent
garden
we
found
plenty
of
wild
cranberries
and
whortleberries
which
we
dried
for
winter
use
the
lakes
were
full
of
good
fish
black
bass
and
pickerel
and
the
woods
had
deer
turkeys
pheasants
pigeons
and
other
things
and
i
became
quite
an
expert
in
the
capture
of
small
game
for
the
table
with
my
new
gun
father
and
uncle
would
occasionally
kill
a
deer
and
the
indians
came
along
and
sold
venison
at
times
one
fall
after
work
was
done
and
preparations
were
made
for
the
winter
father
said
to
me
now
lewis
i
want
you
to
hunt
every
day
come
home
nights
but
keep
on
till
you
kill
a
deer
so
with
his
permission
i
started
with
my
gun
on
my
shoulder
and
with
feelings
of
considerable
pride
before
night
i
started
two
deer
in
a
brushy
place
and
they
leaped
high
over
the
oak
bushes
in
the
most
affrighted
way
i
brought
my
gun
to
my
shoulder
and
fired
at
the
bounding
animal
when
in
most
plain
sight
loading
then
quickly
i
hurried
up
the
trail
as
fast
as
i
could
and
soon
came
to
my
deer
dead
with
a
bullet
hole
in
its
head
i
was
really
surprised
myself
for
i
had
fired
so
hastily
at
the
almost
flying
animal
that
it
was
little
more
than
a
random
shot
as
the
deer
was
not
very
heavy
i
dressed
it
and
packed
it
home
myself
about
as
proud
a
boy
as
the
state
of
michigan
contained
i
really
began
to
think
i
was
a
capital
hunter
though
i
afterward
knew
it
was
a
bit
of
good
luck
and
not
a
bit
of
skill
about
it
it
was
some
time
after
this
before
i
made
another
lucky
shot
father
would
once
in
a
while
ask
me
well
ca
you
kill
us
another
deer
i
told
him
that
when
i
had
crawled
a
long
time
toward
a
sleeping
deer
that
i
got
so
trembly
that
i
could
not
hit
an
ox
in
short
range
o
said
he
you
get
the
buck
fever
do
be
so
timid
they
wo
attack
you
but
after
awhile
this
fever
wore
off
and
i
got
so
steady
that
i
could
hit
anything
i
could
get
in
reach
of
we
were
now
quite
contented
and
happy
father
could
plainly
show
us
the
difference
between
this
country
and
vermont
and
the
advantages
we
had
here
there
the
land
was
poor
and
stony
and
the
winters
terribly
severe
here
there
were
no
stones
to
plow
over
and
the
land
was
otherwise
easy
to
till
we
could
raise
almost
anything
and
have
nice
wheat
bread
to
eat
far
superior
to
the
we
used
to
have
the
nice
white
bread
was
good
enough
to
eat
without
butter
and
in
comparison
this
country
seemed
a
real
paradise
the
supply
of
clothing
we
brought
with
us
had
lasted
until
now
more
than
two
years
and
we
had
sowed
some
flax
and
raised
sheep
so
that
we
began
to
get
material
of
our
own
raising
from
which
to
manufacture
some
more
mother
and
sister
spun
some
nice
yarn
both
woolen
and
linen
and
father
had
a
loom
made
on
which
mother
wove
it
up
into
cloth
and
we
were
soon
dressed
up
in
bran
new
clothes
again
domestic
economy
of
this
kind
was
as
necessary
here
as
it
was
in
vermont
and
we
knew
well
how
to
practice
it
about
this
time
the
emigrants
began
to
come
in
very
fast
and
every
piece
of
government
land
any
where
about
was
taken
so
much
land
was
ploughed
and
so
much
vegetable
matter
turned
under
and
decaying
that
there
came
a
regular
epidemic
of
fever
and
ague
and
bilious
fever
and
a
large
majority
of
the
people
were
sick
at
our
house
father
was
the
first
one
attacked
and
when
the
fever
was
at
its
height
he
was
quite
out
of
his
head
and
talked
and
acted
like
a
crazy
man
we
had
never
seen
any
one
so
sick
before
and
we
thought
he
must
surely
die
but
when
the
doctor
came
he
said
do
be
alarmed
it
is
only
agur
and
no
one
was
ever
known
to
die
of
that
others
of
us
were
sick
too
and
most
of
the
neighbors
and
it
made
us
all
feel
rather
sorrowful
the
doctor
medicines
consisted
of
calomel
jalap
and
quinine
all
used
pretty
freely
by
some
with
benefit
and
by
others
to
no
visible
purpose
for
they
had
to
suffer
until
the
cold
weather
came
and
froze
the
disease
out
at
one
time
i
was
the
only
one
that
remained
well
and
i
had
to
nurse
and
cook
besides
all
the
work
that
fell
to
me
my
sister
married
a
man
near
by
with
a
good
farm
and
moved
there
with
him
a
mile
or
two
away
when
she
went
away
i
lost
my
real
bosom
companion
and
felt
very
lonesome
but
i
went
to
see
her
once
in
a
while
and
that
was
pretty
often
i
think
there
was
not
much
going
on
as
a
general
thing
some
little
neighborhood
society
and
news
was
about
all
there
was
however
one
incident
which
occurred
in
i
never
shall
forget
and
which
i
will
relate
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
iv
about
two
miles
west
father
farm
in
jackson
county
lived
ami
filley
who
moved
here
from
connecticut
and
settled
about
two
and
a
half
miles
from
the
town
of
jackson
then
a
small
village
with
plenty
of
stumps
and
mudholes
in
its
streets
many
of
the
roads
leading
thereto
had
been
paved
with
tamarac
poles
making
what
is
now
known
as
corduroy
roads
the
country
was
still
new
and
the
farm
houses
far
between
filley
secured
government
land
in
the
oak
openings
and
settled
there
with
his
wife
and
two
or
three
children
the
oldest
of
which
was
a
boy
named
willie
the
children
were
getting
old
enough
to
go
to
school
but
there
being
none
filley
hired
one
of
the
neighbor
daughters
to
come
to
his
house
and
teach
the
children
there
so
they
might
be
prepared
for
usefulness
in
life
or
ready
to
proceed
further
with
their
education
to
college
perhaps
in
some
future
day
the
young
woman
he
engaged
lived
about
a
mile
a
half
away
miss
mary
mount
and
she
came
over
and
began
her
duties
as
private
school
not
a
very
difficult
task
in
those
days
one
day
after
she
had
been
teaching
some
time
miss
mount
desired
to
go
to
her
father
on
a
visit
and
as
she
would
pass
a
huckleberry
swamp
on
the
way
she
took
a
small
pail
to
fill
with
berries
as
she
went
and
by
consent
of
mother
the
little
boy
went
with
her
for
company
reaching
the
berries
she
began
to
pick
and
the
little
boy
found
this
dull
business
got
tired
and
homesick
and
wanted
to
go
home
they
were
about
a
mile
from
filley
and
as
there
was
a
pretty
good
foot
trail
over
which
they
had
come
the
young
woman
took
the
boy
to
it
and
turning
him
toward
home
told
him
to
follow
it
carefully
and
he
would
soon
see
his
mother
she
then
filled
her
pail
with
berries
went
on
to
her
own
home
and
remained
there
till
nearly
sundown
when
she
set
out
to
return
to
filley
reaching
there
yet
in
the
early
twilight
not
seeing
willie
she
inquired
for
him
and
was
told
that
he
had
not
returned
and
that
they
supposed
he
was
safe
with
her
she
then
hastily
related
how
it
happened
that
he
had
started
back
toward
home
and
that
she
supposed
he
had
safely
arrived
filley
then
started
back
on
the
trail
keeping
close
watch
on
each
side
of
the
way
for
he
expected
he
would
soon
come
across
master
willie
fast
asleep
he
called
his
name
every
few
rods
but
got
no
answer
nor
could
he
discover
him
and
so
returned
home
again
still
calling
and
searching
but
no
boy
was
discovered
then
he
built
a
large
fire
and
put
lighted
candles
in
all
the
windows
then
took
his
lantern
and
wont
out
in
the
woods
calling
and
looking
for
the
boy
sometimes
he
thought
he
heard
him
but
on
going
where
the
sound
came
from
nothing
could
be
found
so
he
looked
and
called
all
night
along
the
trail
and
all
about
the
woods
with
no
success
mount
home
was
situated
not
far
from
the
shore
of
fitch
lake
and
the
trail
went
along
the
margin
and
in
some
places
the
ground
was
quite
a
boggy
marsh
and
the
trail
had
been
fixed
up
to
make
it
passably
good
walking
next
day
the
neighbors
were
notified
and
asked
to
assist
and
although
they
were
in
the
midst
of
wheat
harvest
a
great
many
laid
down
the
cradle
and
rake
and
went
out
to
help
search
on
the
third
day
the
whole
county
became
excited
and
quite
an
army
of
searchers
turned
out
coming
from
the
whole
country
miles
around
filley
was
much
excited
and
quite
worn
out
an
beside
himself
with
fatigue
and
loss
of
sleep
he
could
not
eat
yielding
to
entreaty
he
would
sit
at
the
table
and
suddenly
rise
up
saying
he
heard
willie
calling
and
go
out
to
search
for
the
supposed
voice
but
it
was
all
fruitless
and
the
whole
people
were
sorry
indeed
for
the
poor
father
and
mother
the
people
then
formed
a
plan
for
a
thorough
search
they
were
to
form
in
a
line
so
near
each
other
that
they
could
touch
hands
and
were
to
march
thus
turning
out
for
nothing
except
in
passable
lakes
and
thus
we
marched
fairly
sweeping
the
county
in
search
of
a
sign
i
was
with
this
party
and
we
marched
south
and
kept
close
watch
for
a
bit
of
clothing
a
foot
print
or
even
bones
or
anything
which
would
indicate
that
he
had
been
destroyed
by
some
wild
animal
thus
we
marched
all
day
with
no
success
and
the
next
went
north
in
the
same
careful
manner
but
with
no
better
result
most
of
the
people
now
abandoned
the
search
but
some
of
the
neighbors
kept
it
up
for
a
long
time
some
expressed
themselves
quite
strongly
that
miss
mount
knew
where
the
boy
was
saying
that
she
might
have
had
some
trouble
with
him
and
in
seeking
to
correct
him
had
accidentally
killed
him
and
then
hidden
the
body
away
perhaps
in
the
deep
mire
of
the
swamp
or
in
the
muddy
waters
on
the
margin
of
the
lake
search
was
made
with
this
idea
foremost
but
nothing
was
discovered
rain
now
set
in
and
the
grain
from
neglect
grew
in
the
head
as
it
stood
and
many
a
settler
ate
poor
bread
all
winter
in
consequence
of
his
neighborly
kindness
in
the
midst
of
harvest
the
bread
would
not
rise
and
to
make
it
into
pancakes
was
the
best
way
it
could
be
used
still
no
tidings
ever
came
of
the
lost
boy
many
things
were
whispered
about
mount
dishonesty
of
character
and
there
were
many
suspicions
about
him
but
no
real
facts
could
be
shown
to
account
for
the
boy
the
neighbors
said
he
never
worked
like
the
rest
of
them
and
that
his
patch
of
cultivated
land
was
altogether
too
small
to
support
his
family
a
wife
and
two
daughters
grown
he
was
a
very
smooth
and
affable
talker
and
had
lots
of
acquaintances
a
few
years
afterwards
mount
was
convicted
of
a
crime
which
sent
him
to
the
jackson
state
prison
where
he
died
before
his
term
expired
i
visited
the
filley
family
in
and
from
them
heard
the
facts
anew
and
that
no
trace
of
the
lost
boy
had
ever
been
discovered
chapter
the
second
year
of
sickness
and
i
was
affected
with
the
rest
though
it
was
not
generally
so
bad
as
the
first
year
i
suffered
a
great
deal
and
felt
so
miserable
that
i
began
to
think
i
had
rather
live
on
the
top
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
catch
chipmuncks
for
a
living
than
to
live
here
and
be
sick
and
i
began
to
have
very
serious
thoughts
of
trying
some
other
country
in
the
winter
of
and
i
went
to
a
neighboring
school
for
three
months
where
i
studied
reading
writing
and
spelling
getting
as
far
as
rule
of
three
in
daboll
arithmetic
when
school
was
out
i
chopped
and
split
rails
for
wm
hanna
till
i
had
paid
my
board
after
this
myself
and
a
young
man
named
orrin
henry
with
whom
i
had
become
acquainted
worked
awhile
scoring
timber
to
be
used
in
building
the
michigan
central
railroad
which
had
just
then
begun
to
be
built
they
laid
down
the
ties
first
sometimes
a
mudsill
under
them
and
then
put
down
four
by
eight
wooden
rails
with
a
strips
of
band
iron
half
an
inch
thick
spiked
on
top
i
scored
the
timber
and
henry
used
the
broad
axe
after
me
it
was
pretty
hard
work
and
the
hours
as
long
as
we
could
see
our
wages
being
per
month
half
cash
in
thinking
over
our
prospect
it
seemed
more
and
more
as
if
i
had
better
look
out
for
my
own
fortune
in
some
other
place
the
farm
was
pretty
small
for
all
of
us
there
were
three
brothers
younger
than
i
and
only
acres
in
the
whole
and
as
they
were
growing
up
to
be
men
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
be
best
for
me
the
oldest
to
start
out
first
and
see
what
could
be
done
to
make
my
own
living
i
talked
to
father
and
mother
about
my
plans
and
they
did
not
seriously
object
but
gave
me
some
good
advice
which
i
remember
to
this
day
weigh
well
every
thing
you
do
shun
bad
company
be
honest
and
deal
fair
be
truthful
and
never
fear
when
you
know
you
are
right
but
said
he
our
little
peach
trees
will
bear
this
year
and
if
you
go
away
you
must
come
back
and
help
us
eat
them
they
will
be
the
first
we
ever
raised
or
ever
saw
i
could
not
promise
henry
and
i
drew
our
pay
for
our
work
i
had
five
dollars
in
cash
and
the
rest
in
pay
from
the
company
store
we
purchased
three
nice
whitewood
boards
eighteen
inches
wide
from
which
we
made
us
a
boat
and
a
good
sized
chest
which
we
filled
with
provisions
and
some
clothing
and
quilts
this
with
our
guns
and
ammunition
composed
the
cargo
of
our
boat
when
all
was
ready
we
put
the
boat
on
a
wagon
and
were
to
haul
it
to
the
river
some
eight
miles
away
for
embarkation
after
getting
the
wagon
loaded
father
said
to
me
now
my
son
you
are
starting
out
in
life
alone
no
one
to
watch
or
look
after
you
you
will
have
to
depend
upon
yourself
in
all
things
you
have
a
wide
wide
world
to
operate
in
you
will
meet
all
kinds
of
people
and
you
must
not
expect
to
find
them
all
honest
or
true
friends
you
are
limited
in
money
and
all
i
can
do
for
you
in
that
way
is
to
let
you
have
what
ready
money
i
have
he
handed
me
three
dollars
as
he
spoke
which
added
to
my
own
gave
me
seven
dollars
as
my
money
capital
with
which
to
start
out
into
the
world
among
perfect
strangers
and
no
acquaintances
in
prospect
on
our
western
course
when
ready
to
start
mother
and
sister
poll
came
out
to
see
us
off
and
to
give
us
their
best
wishes
hoping
we
would
have
good
health
and
find
pleasant
paths
to
follow
mother
said
to
me
you
must
be
a
good
boy
honest
and
remember
our
advice
and
honor
us
for
we
have
striven
to
make
you
a
good
and
honest
man
and
you
must
follow
our
teachings
and
your
conscience
will
be
clear
do
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
be
industrious
and
you
have
no
fear
of
punishment
we
were
given
a
great
many
good
byes
and
god
bless
you
as
with
hands
hats
and
handkerchiefs
they
waved
us
off
as
far
as
we
could
see
them
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
we
were
at
the
water
edge
and
on
a
beautiful
morning
in
early
spring
of
we
found
ourselves
floating
down
the
grand
river
below
jackson
the
stream
ran
west
that
we
knew
and
it
was
west
we
thought
we
wanted
to
go
so
all
things
suited
us
the
stream
was
small
with
tall
timber
on
both
sides
and
so
many
trees
had
fallen
into
the
river
that
our
navigation
was
at
times
seriously
obstructed
when
night
came
we
hauled
our
boat
on
shore
turned
it
partly
over
so
as
to
shelter
us
built
a
fire
in
front
and
made
a
bed
on
a
loose
board
which
we
carried
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
we
talked
till
pretty
late
and
then
lay
down
to
sleep
but
for
my
part
my
eyes
would
not
stay
shut
and
i
lay
till
break
of
day
and
the
little
birds
began
to
sing
faintly
i
thought
of
many
things
that
night
which
seemed
so
long
i
had
left
a
good
dear
home
where
i
had
good
warm
meals
and
a
soft
and
comfortable
bed
here
i
had
reposed
on
a
board
with
a
very
hard
pillow
and
none
too
many
blankets
and
i
turned
from
side
to
side
on
my
hard
bed
to
which
i
had
gone
with
all
my
clothes
on
it
seemed
the
beginning
of
another
chapter
in
my
pioneer
life
and
a
rather
tough
experience
i
arose
kindled
a
big
fire
and
sat
looking
at
the
glowing
coals
in
still
further
meditation
neither
of
us
felt
very
gleeful
as
we
got
our
breakfast
and
made
an
early
start
down
the
river
again
neither
of
us
talked
very
much
and
no
doubt
my
companion
had
similar
thoughts
to
mine
and
wondered
what
was
before
us
but
i
think
that
as
a
pair
we
were
at
that
moment
pretty
lonesome
henry
had
rested
better
than
i
but
probably
felt
no
less
keenly
the
separation
from
our
homes
and
friends
we
saw
plenty
of
squirrels
and
pigeons
on
the
trees
which
overhung
the
river
and
we
shot
and
picked
up
as
many
as
we
thought
we
could
use
for
food
when
we
fired
our
guns
the
echoes
rolled
up
and
down
the
river
for
miles
making
the
feeling
of
loneliness
still
more
keen
as
the
sound
died
faintly
away
we
floated
along
generally
very
quietly
we
could
see
the
fish
dart
under
our
boat
from
their
feeding
places
along
the
bank
and
now
and
then
some
tall
crane
would
spread
his
broad
wings
to
get
out
of
our
way
we
saw
no
houses
for
several
days
and
seldom
went
on
shore
the
forest
was
all
hard
wood
such
as
oak
ash
walnut
maple
elm
and
beech
farther
down
we
occasionally
passed
the
house
of
some
pioneer
hunter
or
trapper
with
a
small
patch
cleared
at
one
of
these
a
big
green
boy
came
down
to
the
bank
to
see
who
we
were
we
said
how
do
to
him
and
getting
no
response
henry
asked
him
how
far
is
was
to
michigan
at
which
a
look
of
supreme
disgust
came
over
his
features
as
he
replied
no
far
at
all
the
stream
grew
wider
as
we
advanced
along
its
downward
course
for
smaller
streams
came
pouring
in
to
swell
its
tide
the
banks
were
still
covered
with
heavy
timber
and
in
some
places
with
quite
thick
undergrowth
one
day
we
saw
a
black
bear
in
the
river
washing
himself
but
he
went
ashore
before
we
were
near
enough
to
get
a
sure
shot
at
him
many
deer
tracks
were
seen
along
the
shore
but
as
we
saw
very
few
of
the
animals
themselves
they
were
probably
night
visitors
one
day
we
overtook
some
canoes
containing
indians
men
women
and
children
they
were
poling
their
craft
around
in
all
directions
spearing
fish
they
caught
many
large
mullet
and
then
went
on
shore
and
made
camp
and
the
red
ladies
began
scaling
the
fish
as
soon
as
their
lords
and
masters
had
unloaded
the
canoes
a
party
started
out
with
four
of
the
boats
two
men
in
a
boat
to
try
their
luck
again
they
ranged
all
abreast
and
moved
slowly
down
the
stream
in
the
still
deep
water
continually
beating
the
surface
with
their
spear
handles
till
they
came
to
a
place
so
shallow
that
they
could
see
the
bottom
easily
when
they
suddenly
turned
the
canoes
head
up
stream
and
while
one
held
the
craft
steady
by
sticking
his
spear
handle
down
on
the
bottom
the
other
stood
erect
with
a
foot
on
either
gunwale
so
he
could
see
whatever
came
down
on
either
side
soon
the
big
fish
would
try
to
pass
but
indian
had
too
sharp
an
eye
to
let
him
escape
unobserved
and
when
he
came
within
his
reach
he
would
turn
his
spear
and
throw
it
like
a
dart
seldom
missing
his
aim
the
poor
fish
would
struggle
desperately
but
soon
came
to
the
surface
when
he
would
be
drawn
in
and
knocked
in
the
head
with
a
tomahawk
to
quiet
him
when
the
spear
was
cut
out
and
the
process
repeated
we
watched
them
about
an
hour
and
during
that
time
some
one
of
the
boats
was
continually
hauling
in
a
fish
they
were
sturgeon
and
very
large
this
was
the
first
time
we
had
ever
seen
the
indian
way
of
catching
fish
and
it
was
a
new
way
of
getting
grub
for
us
when
the
canoes
had
full
loads
they
paddled
up
toward
their
camp
and
we
drifted
on
again
when
we
came
to
grand
rapids
we
had
to
go
on
shore
and
tow
our
boat
carefully
along
over
the
many
rocks
to
prevent
accident
here
was
a
small
cheap
looking
town
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
a
water
wheel
was
driving
a
drill
boring
for
salt
water
it
seemed
through
solid
rock
up
to
this
time
the
current
was
slow
and
its
course
through
a
dense
forest
we
occasionally
saw
an
indian
gliding
around
in
his
canoe
but
no
houses
or
clearings
occasionally
we
saw
some
pine
logs
which
had
been
floated
down
some
of
the
streams
of
the
north
one
of
these
small
rivers
they
called
the
and
seemed
to
be
the
largest
of
them
passing
on
we
began
to
see
some
pine
timber
and
realized
that
we
were
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
where
it
emptied
into
lake
michigan
there
were
some
steam
saw
mills
here
not
then
in
operation
and
some
houses
for
the
mill
hands
to
live
in
when
they
were
at
work
this
prospective
city
was
called
grand
haven
there
was
one
schooner
in
the
river
loaded
with
lumber
ready
to
sail
for
the
west
side
of
the
lake
as
soon
as
the
wind
should
change
and
become
favorable
and
we
engaged
passage
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
each
while
waiting
for
the
wind
we
visited
the
woods
in
search
of
game
but
found
none
all
the
surface
of
the
soil
was
clear
lake
sand
and
some
quite
large
pine
and
hemlock
trees
were
half
buried
in
it
we
were
not
pleased
with
this
place
for
it
looked
as
if
folks
must
get
their
grub
from
somewhere
else
or
live
on
fish
next
morning
we
were
off
early
as
the
wind
had
changed
but
the
lake
was
very
rough
and
a
heavy
choppy
sea
was
running
before
we
were
half
way
across
the
lake
nearly
all
were
passengers
and
sailors
the
poor
fellow
at
the
helm
stuck
to
his
post
casting
up
his
accounts
at
the
same
time
putting
on
an
air
of
terrible
misery
this
i
thought
was
pretty
hard
usage
for
a
like
myself
who
had
never
been
on
such
rough
water
before
the
effect
of
this
was
to
cure
me
of
a
slight
fever
and
ague
and
in
fact
the
cure
was
so
thorough
that
i
have
never
had
it
since
as
we
neared
the
western
shore
a
few
houses
could
be
seen
and
the
captain
said
it
was
southport
as
there
was
no
wharf
our
schooner
put
out
into
the
lake
again
for
an
hour
or
so
and
then
ran
back
again
lying
off
and
on
in
this
manner
all
night
in
the
morning
it
was
quite
calm
and
we
went
on
shore
in
the
schooner
yawl
landing
on
a
sandy
beach
we
left
our
chest
of
clothes
and
other
things
in
a
warehouse
and
shouldered
our
packs
and
guns
for
a
march
across
what
seemed
an
endless
prairie
stretching
to
the
west
we
had
spent
all
our
lives
thus
far
in
a
country
where
all
the
clearing
had
to
be
made
with
an
axe
and
such
a
broad
field
was
to
us
an
entirely
new
feature
we
laid
our
course
westward
and
tramped
on
the
houses
were
very
far
apart
and
we
tried
at
every
one
of
them
for
a
chance
to
work
but
could
get
none
not
even
if
we
would
work
for
our
board
the
people
all
seemed
to
be
new
settlers
and
very
poor
compelled
to
do
their
own
work
until
a
better
day
could
be
reached
the
coarse
meals
we
got
were
very
reasonable
generally
only
ten
cents
but
sometimes
a
little
more
as
we
travelled
westward
the
prairies
seemed
smaller
with
now
and
then
some
oak
openings
between
some
of
the
farms
seemed
to
be
three
or
four
years
old
and
what
had
been
laid
out
as
towns
consisted
of
from
three
to
six
houses
small
and
cheap
with
plenty
of
vacant
lots
the
soil
looked
rich
as
though
it
might
be
very
productive
we
passed
several
small
lakes
that
had
nice
fish
in
them
and
plenty
of
ducks
on
the
surface
walking
began
to
get
pretty
tiresome
great
blisters
would
come
on
our
feet
and
tender
as
they
were
it
was
a
great
relief
to
take
off
our
boots
and
go
barefoot
for
a
while
when
the
ground
was
favorable
we
crossed
a
wide
prairie
and
came
down
to
the
rock
river
where
there
were
a
few
houses
on
the
east
side
but
no
signs
of
habitation
on
the
west
bank
we
crossed
the
river
in
a
canoe
and
then
walked
seven
miles
before
we
came
to
a
house
where
we
staid
all
night
and
inquired
for
work
none
was
to
be
had
and
so
we
tramped
on
again
the
next
day
we
met
a
real
live
yankee
with
a
wagon
peddling
tin
ware
in
regular
eastern
style
we
inquired
of
him
about
the
road
and
prospects
and
he
gave
us
an
encouraging
idea
said
all
was
good
he
told
us
where
to
stop
the
next
night
at
a
small
town
called
sugar
creek
it
had
but
a
few
houses
and
was
being
built
up
as
a
mining
town
for
some
lead
ore
had
been
found
there
there
were
as
many
irish
as
english
miners
here
a
rough
class
of
people
we
put
up
at
the
house
where
we
had
been
directed
a
low
log
cabin
rough
and
dirty
kept
by
bridget
supper
was
had
after
dark
and
the
light
on
the
table
was
just
the
right
one
for
the
place
a
saucer
of
grease
with
a
rag
in
it
lighted
and
burning
at
the
edge
of
the
saucer
it
at
least
served
to
made
the
darkness
apparent
and
to
prevent
the
dirt
being
visible
we
had
potatoes
beans
and
tea
and
probably
dirt
too
if
we
could
have
seen
it
when
the
meal
was
nearly
done
bridget
brought
in
and
deposited
on
each
plate
a
good
thick
pancake
as
a
dessert
it
smelled
pretty
good
but
when
i
drew
my
knife
across
it
to
cut
it
in
two
all
the
center
was
uncooked
batter
which
ran
out
upon
my
plate
and
spoiled
my
supper
we
went
to
bed
and
soon
found
it
had
other
occupants
beside
ourselves
which
if
they
were
small
were
lively
and
spoiled
our
sleeping
we
left
before
breakfast
and
a
few
miles
out
on
the
prairie
we
came
to
a
house
occupied
by
a
woman
and
one
child
and
we
were
told
we
could
have
breakfast
if
we
could
wait
to
have
it
cooked
everything
looked
cheap
but
cheery
and
after
waiting
a
little
while
outside
we
were
called
in
to
eat
the
meal
consisted
of
corn
bread
bacon
potatoes
and
coffee
it
was
well
cooked
and
looked
better
than
things
did
at
bridget
i
enjoyed
all
but
the
coffee
which
had
a
rich
brown
color
but
when
i
sipped
it
there
was
such
a
bitter
taste
i
surely
thought
there
must
be
quinine
in
it
and
it
made
me
shiver
i
tried
two
or
three
times
to
drink
but
it
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
left
it
we
shouldered
our
loads
and
went
on
again
i
asked
henry
what
kind
of
a
drink
it
was
coffee
said
he
but
i
had
never
seen
any
that
tasted
like
that
and
never
knew
my
father
to
buy
any
such
coffee
as
that
we
labored
along
and
in
time
came
to
another
small
place
called
hamilton
diggings
where
some
lead
mines
were
being
worked
we
stopped
at
a
long
low
log
house
with
a
porch
the
entire
length
and
called
for
bread
and
milk
which
was
soon
set
before
us
the
lady
was
washing
and
the
man
was
playing
with
a
child
on
the
porch
the
little
thing
was
trying
to
walk
the
man
would
swear
terribly
at
it
not
in
an
angry
way
but
in
a
sort
of
careless
blasphemous
style
that
was
terribly
shocking
i
thought
of
the
child
being
reared
in
the
midst
of
such
bad
language
and
reflected
on
the
kind
of
people
we
were
meeting
in
this
far
away
place
they
seemed
more
wicked
and
profane
the
farther
west
we
walked
i
had
always
lived
in
a
more
moral
and
temperate
atmosphere
and
i
was
learning
more
of
some
things
in
the
world
than
i
had
ever
known
before
i
had
little
to
say
and
much
to
see
and
listen
to
and
my
early
precepts
were
not
forgotten
no
work
was
to
be
had
here
and
we
set
out
across
the
prairie
toward
mineral
point
twenty
miles
away
when
within
four
miles
of
that
place
we
stopped
at
the
house
of
daniel
parkinson
a
fine
looking
building
and
after
the
meal
was
over
henry
hired
out
to
him
for
per
month
and
went
to
work
that
day
i
heard
of
a
job
of
cutting
cordwood
six
miles
away
and
went
after
it
for
our
money
was
getting
very
scarce
but
when
i
reached
the
place
i
found
a
man
had
been
there
half
an
hour
before
and
secured
the
job
the
proprietor
crow
gave
me
my
dinner
which
i
accepted
with
many
thanks
for
it
saved
my
coin
to
pay
for
the
next
meal
i
now
went
to
mineral
point
and
searched
the
town
over
for
work
my
purse
contained
cents
only
and
i
slept
in
an
unoccupied
out
house
without
supper
i
bought
crackers
and
dried
beef
for
ten
cents
in
the
morning
and
made
my
first
meal
since
the
day
before
felt
pretty
i
then
went
to
vivian
smelting
furnace
where
they
bought
lead
ore
smelted
it
and
run
it
into
pigs
of
about
pounds
each
he
said
he
had
a
job
for
me
if
i
could
do
it
the
furnace
was
propelled
by
water
and
they
had
a
small
buzz
saw
for
cutting
wood
into
blocks
about
a
foot
long
these
blocks
they
wanted
split
up
in
pieces
about
an
inch
square
to
mix
in
with
charcoal
in
smelting
ore
he
said
he
would
board
me
with
the
other
men
and
give
me
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
a
cord
for
splitting
the
wood
i
felt
awfully
poor
and
a
stranger
and
this
was
a
beginning
for
me
at
any
rate
so
i
went
to
work
with
a
will
and
never
lost
a
minute
of
daylight
till
i
had
split
up
all
the
wood
and
filled
his
woodhouse
completely
up
the
board
was
very
coarse
bacon
potatoes
and
bread
a
man
cook
and
bread
mixed
up
with
salt
and
water
the
old
log
house
where
we
lodged
was
well
infested
with
troublesome
insects
which
worked
nights
at
any
rate
whether
they
rested
days
or
not
and
the
beds
had
a
mild
odor
of
pole
cat
the
house
was
long
low
and
without
windows
in
one
end
was
a
fireplace
and
there
were
two
tiers
of
bunks
on
each
side
supplied
with
straw
only
in
the
space
between
the
bunks
was
a
stationary
table
with
stools
for
seats
i
was
the
only
american
who
boarded
there
and
i
could
not
well
become
very
familiar
with
the
boarders
the
country
was
rolling
and
there
were
many
beautiful
brooks
and
clear
springs
of
water
with
fertile
soil
the
cornish
miners
were
in
the
majority
and
governed
the
locality
politically
my
health
was
excellent
and
so
long
as
i
had
my
gun
and
ammunition
i
could
kill
game
enough
to
live
on
for
prairie
chickens
and
deer
could
be
easily
killed
and
meat
alone
would
sustain
life
so
i
had
no
special
fears
of
starvation
i
was
now
paid
off
and
went
back
to
see
my
companion
henry
i
did
not
hear
of
any
more
work
so
i
concluded
i
would
start
back
toward
my
old
home
in
michigan
and
shouldered
my
bundle
and
gun
turning
my
face
eastward
for
a
long
tramp
across
the
prairie
i
knew
i
had
a
long
tramp
before
me
but
i
thought
best
to
head
that
way
for
my
capital
was
only
ten
dollars
and
i
might
be
compelled
to
walk
the
whole
distance
i
walked
till
about
noon
and
then
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
to
rest
for
this
was
june
and
pretty
warm
i
was
now
alone
in
a
big
territory
thinly
settled
and
thought
of
my
father
home
the
well
set
table
all
happy
and
well
fed
at
any
rate
and
here
was
my
venture
a
sort
of
forlorn
hope
prospects
were
surely
very
gloomy
for
me
here
away
out
west
in
wisconsin
territory
without
a
relative
friend
or
acquaintance
to
call
upon
and
very
small
means
to
travel
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
lonely
road
perhaps
all
the
way
on
foot
there
were
no
laborers
required
hardly
any
money
in
sight
and
no
chance
for
business
i
knew
it
would
be
a
safe
course
to
proceed
toward
home
for
i
had
no
fear
of
starving
the
weather
was
warm
and
i
could
easily
walk
home
long
before
winter
should
come
again
still
the
outlook
was
not
very
pleasing
to
one
in
my
circumstances
i
chose
a
route
which
led
me
some
distance
north
of
the
one
we
travelled
when
we
came
west
but
it
was
about
the
same
every
house
was
a
new
settler
and
hardly
one
who
had
yet
produced
anything
to
live
upon
in
due
time
i
came
to
the
rock
river
and
the
only
house
in
sight
was
upon
the
east
bank
i
could
see
a
boat
over
there
and
so
i
called
for
it
and
a
young
girl
came
over
with
a
canoe
for
me
i
took
a
paddle
and
helped
her
hold
the
boat
against
the
current
and
we
made
the
landing
safely
i
paid
her
ten
cents
for
ferriage
and
went
on
again
the
country
was
now
level
with
openings
near
sundown
i
came
to
a
small
prairie
of
about
acres
surrounded
by
scattering
timber
with
not
a
hill
in
sight
and
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
most
beautiful
spot
on
earth
this
i
found
to
belong
to
a
man
named
meachem
who
had
an
octagon
concrete
house
built
on
one
side
of
the
opening
the
house
had
a
hollow
column
in
the
center
and
the
roof
was
so
constructed
that
all
the
rain
water
went
down
this
central
column
into
a
cistern
below
for
house
use
the
stairs
wound
around
this
central
column
and
the
whole
affair
was
quite
different
from
the
most
of
settlers
houses
i
staid
here
all
night
had
supper
and
breakfast
and
paid
my
bill
of
cents
he
had
no
work
for
me
so
i
went
on
again
i
crossed
heart
prairie
passed
through
a
strip
of
woods
and
out
at
round
prairie
it
was
level
as
a
floor
with
a
slight
rise
in
one
corner
and
on
it
were
five
or
six
settlers
here
fortune
favored
me
for
here
i
found
a
man
whom
i
knew
who
once
lived
in
michigan
and
was
one
of
our
neighbors
there
for
some
time
his
name
was
nelson
cornish
i
rested
here
a
few
days
and
made
a
bargain
to
work
for
him
two
or
three
days
every
week
for
my
board
as
long
as
i
wished
to
stay
as
i
got
acquainted
i
found
some
work
to
do
and
many
of
my
leisure
hours
i
spent
in
the
woods
with
my
gun
killing
some
deer
some
of
the
meat
of
which
i
sold
in
haying
and
harvest
i
got
some
work
at
fifty
cents
to
one
dollar
per
day
and
as
i
had
no
clothes
to
buy
i
spent
no
money
saving
up
about
fifty
dollars
by
fall
i
then
got
a
letter
from
henry
saying
that
i
could
get
work
with
him
for
the
winter
and
i
thought
i
would
go
back
there
again
before
thinking
of
going
west
again
i
had
to
go
to
southport
on
the
lake
and
get
our
clothes
we
had
left
in
our
box
when
we
passed
in
the
spring
so
i
started
one
morning
at
break
of
day
with
a
long
cane
in
each
hand
to
help
me
along
for
i
had
nothing
to
carry
not
even
wearing
a
coat
this
was
a
new
road
thinly
settled
and
a
few
log
houses
building
i
got
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
at
noon
and
then
hurried
on
again
the
last
twenty
miles
was
clear
prairie
and
houses
were
very
far
apart
but
little
more
thickly
settled
as
i
neared
lake
michigan
i
arrived
at
the
town
just
after
dark
and
went
to
a
tavern
and
inquired
about
the
things
i
was
told
that
the
warehouse
had
been
broken
into
and
robbed
and
the
proprietor
had
fled
for
parts
unknown
this
robbed
me
of
all
my
good
clothes
and
i
could
now
go
back
as
lightly
loaded
as
when
i
came
i
found
i
had
walked
sixty
miles
in
that
one
day
and
also
found
myself
very
stiff
and
sore
so
that
i
did
not
start
back
next
day
and
i
took
three
days
for
the
return
trip
a
very
unprofitable
journey
i
was
now
ready
to
go
west
and
coming
across
a
pet
deer
which
i
had
tamed
i
knew
if
i
left
it
it
would
wander
away
with
the
first
wild
ones
that
came
along
and
so
i
killed
it
and
made
my
friends
a
present
of
some
venison
i
chose
still
a
new
route
this
time
that
i
could
see
all
that
was
possible
of
this
big
territory
when
i
could
do
it
so
easily
i
was
always
a
great
admirer
of
nature
and
things
which
remained
as
they
were
created
and
to
the
extent
of
my
observation
i
thought
this
the
most
beautiful
and
perfect
country
i
had
seen
between
vermont
and
the
mississippi
river
the
country
was
nearly
level
the
land
rich
the
prairies
small
with
oak
openings
surrounding
them
very
little
marsh
land
and
streams
of
clear
water
rock
river
was
the
largest
of
these
running
south
next
west
was
sugar
river
then
the
picatonica
through
the
mining
region
the
country
was
rolling
and
abundantly
watered
with
babbling
brooks
and
springs
in
point
of
health
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
far
better
than
michigan
in
henry
letter
to
me
he
had
said
that
he
had
taken
a
timber
claim
in
kentuck
grove
and
had
all
the
wood
engaged
to
cut
at
cents
a
cord
he
said
we
could
board
ourselves
and
save
a
little
money
and
that
in
the
spring
he
would
go
back
to
michigan
with
me
this
had
decided
me
to
go
back
to
mineral
point
i
stopped
a
week
or
two
with
a
man
named
webb
hunting
with
him
and
sold
game
enough
to
bring
me
in
some
six
or
seven
dollars
and
then
resumed
my
journey
on
my
way
i
found
a
log
house
ten
miles
from
a
neighbor
just
before
i
got
to
the
picatonica
river
it
belonged
to
a
mr
shook
who
with
his
wife
and
three
children
lived
on
the
edge
of
a
small
prairie
and
had
a
good
crop
of
corn
he
invited
me
to
stay
with
him
a
few
days
and
as
i
was
tired
i
accepted
his
offer
and
we
went
out
together
and
brought
in
a
deer
we
had
plenty
of
corn
bread
venison
and
coffee
and
lived
well
after
a
few
days
he
wanted
to
kill
a
steer
and
he
led
it
to
a
proper
place
while
i
shot
it
in
the
head
we
had
no
way
to
hang
it
up
so
he
rolled
the
intestines
out
and
i
sat
down
with
my
side
against
the
steer
and
helped
him
to
pull
the
tallow
off
it
was
now
getting
nearly
dark
and
while
he
was
splitting
the
back
bone
with
an
axe
it
slipped
in
his
greasy
hands
and
glancing
cut
a
gash
in
my
leg
six
inches
above
the
knee
i
was
now
laid
up
for
two
or
three
weeks
but
was
well
cared
for
at
his
house
before
i
could
resume
my
journey
snow
had
fallen
to
the
depth
of
about
six
inches
which
made
it
rather
unpleasant
walking
but
in
a
few
days
i
reached
henry
camp
in
kentuck
grove
when
after
comparing
notes
we
both
began
swinging
our
axes
and
piling
up
cordwood
cooking
potatoes
bread
bacon
coffee
and
flapjacks
ourselves
which
we
enjoyed
with
a
relish
i
now
went
to
work
for
peter
parkinson
who
paid
me
thirteen
dollars
per
month
and
i
remained
with
him
till
spring
while
with
him
a
very
sad
affliction
came
to
him
in
the
loss
of
his
wife
he
was
presented
by
her
with
his
first
heir
and
during
her
illness
she
was
cared
for
by
her
mother
cullany
who
had
come
to
live
with
them
during
the
winter
when
the
little
babe
was
two
or
three
weeks
old
the
mother
was
feeling
in
such
good
spirits
that
she
was
left
alone
a
little
while
as
cullany
was
attending
to
some
duties
which
called
her
elsewhere
when
she
returned
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
both
parkinson
and
the
babe
were
gone
everyone
turned
out
to
search
for
her
i
ran
to
the
smokehouse
the
barn
the
stable
in
quick
order
and
not
finding
her
a
search
was
made
for
tracks
and
we
soon
discovered
that
she
had
passed
over
a
few
steps
leading
over
a
fence
and
down
an
incline
toward
the
spring
house
and
there
fallen
face
downward
on
the
floor
of
the
house
which
was
covered
only
a
few
inches
deep
with
water
lay
the
unfortunate
woman
and
her
child
both
dead
this
was
doubly
distressing
to
parkinson
and
saddened
the
whole
community
both
were
buried
in
one
grave
not
far
from
the
house
and
a
more
impressive
funeral
i
never
beheld
i
now
worked
awhile
again
with
henry
and
we
sold
our
wood
to
bill
park
a
collier
who
made
and
sold
charcoal
to
the
smelters
of
lead
ore
when
the
ice
was
gone
in
the
streams
henry
and
i
shouldered
our
guns
and
bundles
and
made
our
way
to
milwaukee
where
we
arrived
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
the
town
was
small
and
cheaply
built
and
had
no
wharf
so
that
when
the
steamboat
came
we
had
to
go
out
to
it
in
a
small
boat
the
stream
which
came
in
here
was
too
shallow
for
the
steamer
to
enter
when
near
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
we
stopped
at
an
island
to
take
on
food
and
several
cords
of
white
birch
wood
the
next
stopping
place
was
at
michilamackanac
afterward
called
mackinaw
here
was
a
short
wharf
and
a
little
way
back
a
hill
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
thousand
feet
high
on
which
a
fort
had
been
built
on
the
wharf
was
a
mixed
lot
of
people
americans
canadians
irish
indians
squaws
and
papooses
i
saw
there
some
of
the
most
beautiful
fish
i
had
ever
seen
they
would
weigh
twenty
pounds
or
more
and
had
bright
red
and
yellow
spots
all
over
them
they
called
them
trout
and
they
were
beauties
really
at
the
shore
near
by
the
indians
were
loading
a
large
white
birch
bark
canoe
putting
their
luggage
along
the
middle
lengthways
and
the
papooses
on
top
one
man
took
a
stern
seat
to
steer
and
four
or
five
more
had
seats
along
the
gunwale
as
paddlers
and
as
they
moved
away
their
strokes
were
as
even
and
regular
as
the
motions
of
an
engine
and
their
crafts
danced
as
lightly
on
the
water
as
an
egg
shell
they
were
starting
for
the
michigan
shore
some
eight
or
ten
miles
away
this
was
the
first
birch
bark
canoe
i
had
ever
seen
and
was
a
great
curiosity
in
my
eyes
we
crossed
lake
huron
during
the
night
and
through
its
outlet
so
shallow
that
the
wheels
stirred
up
the
mud
from
the
bottom
then
through
lake
clair
and
landed
safety
at
detroit
next
day
here
we
took
the
cars
on
the
michigan
central
railroad
and
on
our
way
westward
stopped
at
the
very
place
where
we
had
worked
helping
to
build
the
road
a
year
or
more
before
after
getting
off
the
train
a
walk
of
two
and
one
half
miles
brought
me
to
my
father
house
where
i
had
a
right
royal
welcome
and
the
questions
they
asked
me
about
the
wild
country
i
had
traveled
over
how
it
looked
and
how
i
got
along
were
numbered
by
the
thousand
i
remained
at
home
until
fall
getting
some
work
to
do
by
which
i
saved
some
money
but
in
august
was
attacked
with
bilious
fever
which
held
me
down
for
several
weeks
but
nursed
by
a
tender
and
loving
mother
with
untiring
care
i
recovered
quite
slowly
but
surely
i
felt
that
i
had
been
close
to
death
and
that
this
country
was
not
to
be
compared
to
wisconsin
with
its
clear
and
bubbling
springs
of
water
feeling
thus
i
determined
to
go
back
there
again
chapter
vi
with
the
idea
of
returning
to
wisconsin
i
made
plans
for
my
movements
i
purchased
a
good
outfit
of
steel
traps
of
several
kinds
and
sizes
thirty
or
forty
in
all
made
me
a
pine
chest
with
a
false
bottom
to
separate
the
traps
from
my
clothing
when
it
was
packed
in
traveling
order
the
clothes
at
the
top
my
former
experience
had
taught
me
not
to
expect
to
get
work
there
during
winter
but
i
was
pretty
sure
something
could
be
earned
by
trapping
and
hunting
at
this
season
and
in
summer
i
was
pretty
sure
of
something
to
do
i
had
about
forty
dollars
to
travel
on
this
time
and
quite
a
stock
of
experience
the
second
parting
from
home
was
not
so
hard
as
the
first
one
i
went
to
huron
took
the
steamer
to
chicago
then
a
small
cheaply
built
town
with
rough
sidewalks
and
terribly
muddy
streets
and
the
people
seemed
pretty
rough
for
sailors
and
lake
captains
were
numerous
and
knock
downs
quite
frequent
the
country
for
a
long
way
west
of
town
seemed
a
low
wet
marsh
or
prairie
finding
a
man
going
west
with
a
wagon
and
two
horses
without
a
load
i
hired
him
to
take
me
and
my
baggage
to
my
friend
nelson
cornish
at
round
prairie
they
were
glad
to
see
me
and
as
i
had
not
yet
got
strong
from
my
fever
they
persuaded
me
to
stay
a
while
with
them
and
take
some
medicine
for
he
was
a
sort
of
a
doctor
i
think
he
must
have
given
me
a
dose
of
calomel
for
i
had
a
terribly
sore
mouth
and
could
not
eat
any
for
two
or
three
weeks
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
travel
i
had
myself
and
chest
taken
to
the
stage
station
on
the
line
for
the
lake
to
mineral
point
i
think
this
place
was
called
geneva
on
the
stage
i
got
along
pretty
fast
and
part
of
the
time
on
a
new
road
the
first
place
of
note
was
madison
the
capital
of
the
territory
situated
on
a
block
of
land
nearly
surrounded
by
four
lakes
all
plainly
seen
from
the
big
house
further
on
at
the
blue
mounds
i
left
the
stage
putting
my
chest
in
the
landlord
keeping
till
i
should
come
or
send
for
it
i
walked
about
ten
miles
to
the
house
of
a
friend
named
bennett
who
was
a
hunter
and
lived
on
the
bank
of
the
picatonica
river
with
his
wife
and
two
children
i
had
to
take
many
a
rest
on
the
way
for
i
was
very
weak
resting
the
first
few
days
bennett
father
dilly
took
us
out
about
six
miles
and
left
us
to
hunt
and
camp
for
a
few
days
we
were
quite
successful
and
killed
five
nice
fat
deer
which
we
dressed
and
took
to
mineral
point
selling
them
rapidly
to
the
cornish
miners
for
cents
a
quarter
for
the
meat
we
followed
this
business
till
about
january
first
when
the
game
began
to
get
poor
when
we
hung
up
our
guns
for
a
while
i
had
a
little
money
left
yet
the
only
money
in
circulation
was
american
silver
and
british
sovereigns
they
would
not
sell
lead
ore
for
paper
money
nor
on
credit
during
the
spring
i
used
my
traps
successfully
so
that
i
saved
something
over
board
and
expenses
in
summer
i
worked
in
the
mines
with
edwin
buck
of
bucksport
maine
but
only
found
lead
ore
enough
to
pay
our
expenses
in
getting
it
next
winter
i
chopped
wood
for
cents
per
cord
and
boarded
myself
this
was
poor
business
poorer
than
hunting
in
summer
i
found
work
at
various
things
but
in
the
fall
buck
and
myself
concluded
that
as
we
were
both
hunters
and
trappers
we
would
go
northward
toward
lake
superior
on
a
hunting
expedition
and
perhaps
remain
all
winter
we
replenished
our
outfit
and
engaged
bennett
to
take
us
well
up
into
the
north
country
we
crossed
the
wisconsin
river
near
muscoda
went
then
to
prairie
du
chien
where
we
found
a
large
stone
fur
trading
house
owned
by
brisbois
a
frenchman
from
whom
we
obtained
some
information
of
the
country
further
on
he
assured
us
there
was
no
danger
from
the
indians
if
we
let
them
alone
and
treated
them
fairly
we
bought
fifty
pounds
of
flour
for
each
of
us
and
then
started
up
the
divide
between
the
wisconsin
and
mississippi
rivers
on
one
side
flowed
the
bad
river
and
on
the
other
the
kickapoo
we
traveled
on
this
divide
about
three
days
when
bennett
became
afraid
to
go
any
further
as
he
had
to
return
alone
and
the
indians
might
capture
him
before
he
could
get
back
to
the
settlement
we
camped
early
one
night
and
went
out
hunting
to
get
some
game
for
him
i
killed
a
large
black
bear
and
bennett
took
what
he
wanted
of
it
including
the
skin
and
started
back
next
morning
we
now
cachéd
our
things
in
various
places
scattering
them
well
some
went
in
hollow
logs
and
some
under
heaps
of
brush
or
other
places
where
the
indians
could
not
find
them
we
then
built
a
small
cabin
about
six
by
eight
feet
in
size
and
four
feet
high
in
shape
like
a
a
we
were
not
thoroughly
pleased
with
this
location
and
started
out
to
explore
the
country
to
the
north
of
us
for
we
had
an
idea
that
it
would
be
better
hunting
there
the
first
day
we
started
north
we
killed
a
bear
and
filled
our
stomachs
with
the
fat
sweet
meat
the
next
night
we
killed
another
bear
after
a
little
struggling
the
dog
made
him
climb
a
tree
and
we
shot
at
him
he
would
fall
to
the
ground
as
if
dead
but
would
be
on
his
feet
again
in
an
instant
when
after
the
dog
had
fastened
to
his
ham
he
would
climb
the
tree
again
in
the
third
trial
he
lay
in
the
fork
and
had
a
good
chance
to
look
square
at
his
tormentor
i
shot
him
in
the
head
and
as
he
lay
perfectly
still
buck
said
now
you
have
done
it
we
ca
get
him
but
in
a
moment
he
began
to
struggle
and
soon
came
down
lifeless
here
we
camped
on
the
edge
of
the
pine
forest
ate
all
the
fat
bear
meat
we
could
and
in
the
morning
took
separate
routes
agreeing
to
meet
again
a
mile
or
so
farther
up
a
small
brook
i
soon
saw
a
small
bear
walking
on
a
log
and
shot
him
dead
his
mate
got
away
but
i
set
my
dog
on
him
and
he
soon
had
to
climb
a
tree
when
i
came
up
to
where
the
dog
was
barking
i
saw
bear
and
fired
a
ball
in
him
that
brought
him
down
just
then
i
heard
buck
shoot
close
by
and
i
went
to
him
and
found
he
had
killed
another
and
larger
bear
we
stayed
here
another
night
dressed
our
game
and
sunk
the
meat
in
the
brook
and
fastened
it
down
thinking
we
might
want
to
get
some
of
it
another
time
we
were
so
well
pleased
with
this
hunting
ground
that
we
took
the
bear
skins
and
went
back
to
camp
when
we
got
there
our
clothes
were
pretty
well
saturated
with
bear
oil
and
we
jokingly
said
it
must
have
soaked
through
our
bodies
we
had
eaten
so
much
bear
meat
i
began
to
feel
quite
sick
and
had
a
bad
headache
i
felt
as
if
something
must
be
done
but
we
had
no
medicine
buck
went
down
by
the
creek
and
dug
some
roots
he
called
indian
physic
then
steeped
them
until
the
infusion
seemed
as
black
as
molasses
and
when
cool
told
me
to
take
a
swallow
every
fifteen
minutes
for
an
hour
then
half
as
much
for
another
hour
as
long
as
i
could
keep
it
down
i
followed
directions
and
vomited
freely
and
for
a
long
time
but
felt
better
afterward
and
soon
got
well
it
reminded
me
some
of
the
feelings
i
had
when
i
was
seasick
on
lake
michigan
it
may
be
interesting
to
describe
how
we
were
dressed
to
enter
on
this
winter
campaign
we
wore
moccasins
of
our
own
make
i
had
a
buckskin
jumper
and
leggins
that
came
up
to
my
hips
on
my
head
a
drab
hat
that
fitted
close
and
had
a
rim
about
two
inches
wide
in
fair
weather
i
went
indian
fashion
i
carried
a
tomahawk
which
i
had
made
the
blade
was
two
inches
wide
and
three
inches
long
the
poll
two
inches
long
and
about
as
large
round
as
a
dime
handle
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
long
with
a
knob
on
the
end
so
it
would
not
easily
slip
from
the
hand
oiled
patches
for
our
rifle
balls
on
a
string
a
firing
wire
a
charger
to
measure
the
powder
and
a
small
piece
of
leather
with
four
nipples
on
it
for
caps
all
on
my
breast
so
that
i
could
load
very
rapidly
my
bed
was
a
comfort
i
made
myself
a
little
larger
than
usual
i
lay
down
on
one
side
of
the
bed
and
with
my
gun
close
to
me
turned
the
blanket
over
me
when
out
of
camp
i
never
left
my
gun
out
of
my
reach
we
had
to
be
real
indians
in
custom
and
actions
in
order
to
be
considered
their
equals
we
got
our
food
in
the
same
way
they
did
and
so
they
had
nothing
to
ask
us
for
they
considered
themselves
the
real
kings
of
the
forest
we
now
determined
to
move
camp
which
proved
quite
a
job
as
we
had
to
pack
everything
on
our
backs
which
we
did
for
ten
or
fifteen
miles
to
the
bank
of
a
small
stream
where
there
were
three
pine
trees
the
only
ones
to
be
found
in
many
miles
we
made
us
a
canoe
of
one
of
them
while
we
were
making
the
canoe
three
indians
came
along
and
after
they
had
eaten
some
of
our
good
venison
they
left
us
these
were
the
first
we
had
seen
and
we
began
to
be
more
cautious
and
keep
everything
well
hid
away
from
camp
and
make
them
think
we
were
as
poor
as
they
were
so
they
might
not
be
tempted
to
molest
us
we
soon
had
the
canoe
done
and
loaded
and
embarked
on
the
brook
down
stream
we
found
it
rather
difficult
work
but
the
stream
grew
larger
and
we
got
along
very
well
we
came
to
one
place
where
otter
signs
seemed
fresh
and
stopped
to
set
a
trap
for
them
our
dog
sat
on
the
bank
and
watched
the
operation
and
when
we
started
on
we
could
not
get
him
to
ride
or
follow
soon
we
heard
him
cry
and
went
back
to
find
he
had
the
trap
on
his
fore
foot
to
get
it
off
we
had
to
put
a
forked
stick
over
his
neck
and
hold
him
down
he
was
so
excited
over
his
mishap
when
he
was
released
he
left
at
full
speed
and
was
never
seen
by
us
after
when
we
got
well
into
the
pine
woods
we
camped
and
cached
our
traps
and
provisions
on
an
island
and
made
our
camp
further
down
the
stream
and
some
little
distance
from
the
shore
we
soon
found
this
was
very
near
a
logging
camp
and
as
no
one
had
been
living
there
for
a
year
we
moved
camp
down
there
and
occupied
one
of
the
empty
cabins
we
began
to
set
traps
in
long
lines
in
many
different
directions
blazing
the
trees
so
we
could
find
them
if
the
snow
came
on
west
of
this
about
ten
miles
where
we
had
killed
some
deer
earlier
we
made
a
cabin
and
made
dead
falls
many
miles
around
to
catch
fishes
foxes
mink
and
raccoons
we
made
weekly
journeys
to
the
places
and
generally
staid
about
two
nights
one
day
when
going
over
my
trap
lines
i
came
to
a
trap
which
i
had
set
where
i
had
killed
a
deer
and
saw
by
the
snow
that
an
eagle
had
been
caught
in
the
trap
and
had
broken
the
chain
and
gone
away
i
followed
on
the
trail
he
made
and
soon
found
him
he
tried
to
fly
but
the
trap
was
too
heavy
and
he
could
only
go
slowly
and
a
little
way
i
fired
and
put
a
ball
in
him
and
he
fell
and
rolled
under
a
large
log
on
the
hillside
as
i
took
the
trap
off
i
saw
an
indian
coming
down
the
hill
and
brought
my
gun
to
bear
on
him
he
stopped
suddenly
and
made
signs
not
to
shoot
and
i
let
him
come
up
he
made
signs
that
he
wanted
the
feathers
of
the
bird
which
i
told
him
to
take
and
then
he
wanted
to
know
where
we
slept
i
pointed
out
the
way
and
made
him
go
ahead
of
me
there
for
i
did
not
want
him
behind
me
at
camp
he
made
signs
for
something
to
eat
but
when
i
showed
him
meat
he
shook
his
head
however
he
took
a
leg
of
deer
and
started
on
i
following
at
a
good
distance
till
satisfied
that
he
would
not
come
back
we
had
not
taken
pains
to
keep
track
of
the
day
of
the
week
or
month
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
and
the
changes
of
the
moon
were
all
the
almanacs
we
had
then
snow
came
about
a
foot
deep
and
some
days
were
so
cold
we
could
not
leave
our
camp
fire
at
all
as
no
indians
appeared
we
were
quite
successful
and
kept
our
bundle
of
furs
in
a
hollow
standing
tree
some
distance
from
camp
and
when
we
went
that
way
we
never
stopped
or
left
any
sign
that
we
had
a
deposit
there
some
time
after
it
was
all
frozen
up
solid
some
men
with
two
yoke
of
oxen
came
up
to
cut
and
put
logs
in
the
river
to
raft
down
when
the
ice
went
out
with
them
came
a
shingle
weaver
with
a
pony
and
a
small
sled
and
some
indians
also
we
now
had
to
take
up
all
of
our
steel
traps
and
rob
all
our
and
quit
business
generally
even
then
they
got
some
of
our
traps
before
we
could
get
them
gathered
in
we
were
now
comparatively
idle
until
these
loggers
came
we
did
not
know
exactly
where
we
were
situated
but
they
told
us
we
were
on
the
lemonai
river
a
branch
of
the
wisconsin
and
that
we
could
get
out
by
going
west
till
we
found
the
mississippi
river
and
then
home
we
hired
the
shengle
man
with
his
pony
to
take
us
to
black
river
farther
north
which
we
reached
in
three
days
and
found
a
saw
mill
there
in
charge
of
a
keeper
up
the
river
farther
we
found
another
mill
looked
after
by
sam
ferguson
both
mills
were
frozen
up
the
indians
had
been
here
all
winter
they
come
from
lake
superior
when
the
swamps
froze
up
there
to
hunt
deer
till
the
weather
gets
warm
then
they
returned
to
the
lake
to
fish
of
course
the
presence
of
the
indians
made
game
scarce
but
the
mill
men
told
us
if
we
would
go
up
farther
into
the
marten
country
they
thought
we
would
do
well
we
therefore
made
us
a
hand
sled
put
some
provisions
and
traps
on
board
and
started
up
the
river
on
the
ice
as
we
went
the
snow
grew
deeper
and
we
had
to
cut
hemlock
boughs
for
a
bed
on
top
of
the
snow
it
took
about
a
half
a
cord
of
wood
to
last
us
all
night
and
it
was
a
trouble
to
cut
holes
in
the
ice
to
water
for
it
was
more
than
two
feet
thick
our
fire
kindled
on
the
snow
would
be
two
or
three
feet
below
on
the
ground
by
morning
this
country
was
heavily
timbered
with
cedar
or
spruce
and
apparently
very
level
one
day
we
saw
two
otters
coming
toward
us
on
the
ice
we
shot
one
but
as
the
other
gun
missed
fire
the
other
one
escaped
for
i
could
not
overtake
it
in
the
woods
we
kept
on
up
the
river
till
we
began
to
hear
the
indians
guns
and
then
we
camped
and
did
not
fire
a
gun
for
two
days
for
we
were
afraid
we
might
be
discovered
and
robbed
and
we
knew
we
could
not
stay
long
after
our
grub
was
gone
all
the
game
we
could
catch
was
the
marten
or
sable
which
the
indians
called
the
males
were
snuff
color
and
the
female
much
darker
mink
were
scarce
and
the
beaver
living
in
the
river
bank
could
not
be
got
at
till
the
ice
went
out
in
the
spring
we
now
began
to
make
marten
traps
or
and
set
them
for
this
small
game
there
were
many
cedar
and
tamarack
swamps
indeed
that
was
the
principal
feature
but
there
were
some
ridges
a
little
higher
where
some
small
pines
and
beech
grew
now
our
camp
was
one
place
where
there
was
no
large
timber
caused
by
the
stream
being
dammed
by
the
beaver
here
were
some
of
the
real
russian
balsam
trees
the
most
beautiful
in
shape
i
had
ever
seen
they
were
very
dark
green
the
boughs
very
thick
and
the
tree
in
shape
like
an
inverted
top
our
lines
of
trips
led
for
miles
in
every
direction
marked
by
blazed
trees
we
made
a
trap
of
two
poles
and
chips
which
we
split
from
the
trees
these
were
set
in
the
snow
and
covered
with
brush
we
sometimes
found
a
porcupine
in
the
top
of
a
pine
tree
the
only
signs
of
his
presence
were
the
chips
he
made
in
gnawing
the
bark
for
food
they
never
came
down
to
the
ground
as
we
saw
they
were
about
all
the
game
that
was
good
to
eat
i
would
kill
one
skin
it
and
drag
the
carcass
after
me
all
day
as
i
set
traps
cutting
off
bits
for
bait
and
cooking
the
rest
for
ourselves
to
eat
we
tried
to
eat
the
marten
but
it
was
pretty
musky
and
it
was
only
by
putting
on
plenty
of
salt
and
pepper
that
we
managed
to
eat
them
we
were
really
forced
to
do
it
if
we
remained
here
we
secured
a
good
many
of
these
little
fellows
which
have
about
the
the
best
fur
that
is
found
in
america
we
were
here
about
three
weeks
and
our
provisions
giving
out
and
the
ice
becoming
tender
in
the
swamp
were
two
pretty
strong
reasons
for
our
getting
out
so
we
shouldered
our
packs
of
fur
and
our
guns
and
getting
our
course
from
a
we
started
out
as
we
pushed
on
we
came
to
some
old
windfalls
that
were
troublesome
to
get
through
the
dense
timber
seemed
to
be
six
feet
deep
and
we
would
sometimes
climb
over
and
sometimes
crawl
under
the
fallen
trees
were
so
thickly
mixed
and
tangled
buck
got
so
completely
tired
that
he
threw
away
his
traps
we
reached
our
starting
place
at
after
many
days
of
the
hardest
work
and
nearly
starved
for
we
had
seen
no
game
on
our
trip
we
found
our
traps
and
furs
all
safe
here
and
as
this
stream
was
one
of
the
tributaries
of
the
mississippi
we
decided
to
make
us
a
boat
and
float
down
toward
that
noted
stream
we
secured
four
good
boards
and
built
the
boat
in
which
we
started
down
the
river
setting
traps
and
moving
at
our
leisure
we
found
plenty
of
fine
ducks
two
bee
trees
and
caught
some
with
a
hook
and
line
we
got
at
the
mill
we
also
caught
some
otter
and
on
a
little
branch
of
the
river
killed
two
bears
the
skin
of
one
of
them
weighing
five
pounds
we
met
a
keel
boat
being
poled
up
the
river
and
with
the
last
cent
of
money
we
possessed
bought
a
little
flour
of
them
about
the
first
of
may
we
reached
prairie
du
chien
here
we
were
met
with
some
surprise
for
brisbois
said
he
had
heard
we
were
killed
or
lost
he
showed
us
through
his
warehouses
and
pointed
out
to
us
the
many
bales
of
different
kinds
of
furs
he
had
on
hand
he
told
us
we
were
the
best
fur
handlers
he
had
seen
and
paid
us
two
hundred
dollars
in
american
gold
for
what
we
had
we
then
stored
our
traps
in
the
garret
of
one
of
his
warehouses
which
was
of
stone
two
stories
and
an
attic
as
we
thought
of
making
another
trip
to
this
country
if
all
went
well
we
now
entered
our
skiff
again
and
went
on
down
the
great
river
till
we
came
to
a
place
nearly
opposite
mineral
point
when
we
gave
our
boat
to
a
poor
settler
and
with
guns
and
bundles
on
our
backs
took
a
straight
shoot
for
home
on
foot
the
second
day
about
dark
we
came
in
the
edge
of
the
town
and
were
seen
by
a
lot
of
boys
who
eyed
us
closely
and
with
much
curiosity
for
we
were
dressed
in
our
trapping
suits
they
followed
us
and
as
we
went
along
the
crowd
increased
so
that
when
we
got
to
crum
lloyd
tavern
the
door
was
full
of
boys
heads
looking
at
us
as
if
we
were
a
circus
here
we
were
heartily
welcomed
and
every
body
was
glad
to
see
us
as
they
were
about
to
start
a
company
to
go
in
search
of
their
reported
murdered
friends
it
seems
a
missionary
got
lost
on
his
way
to
prairie
la
crosse
and
had
come
across
our
deserted
cabin
and
when
he
came
in
he
reported
us
as
no
doubt
murdered
i
invested
all
of
my
hundred
dollars
in
buying
eighty
acres
of
good
government
land
this
was
the
first
i
ever
had
and
i
felt
very
proud
to
be
a
land
owner
i
felt
a
little
more
like
a
man
now
than
i
had
ever
felt
before
for
the
money
was
hard
earned
and
all
mine
chapter
vii
buck
and
myself
concluded
we
would
try
our
luck
at
lead
mining
for
the
summer
and
purchased
some
mining
tools
for
the
purpose
we
camped
out
and
dug
holes
around
all
summer
getting
just
about
enough
to
pay
our
expenses
not
a
very
encouraging
venture
for
we
had
lived
in
a
tent
and
had
picked
and
shoveled
and
blasted
and
twisted
a
windlass
hard
enough
to
have
earned
a
good
bit
of
money
in
the
fall
we
concluded
to
try
another
trapping
tour
and
set
out
for
prairie
du
chien
we
knew
it
was
a
poor
place
to
spend
money
up
in
the
woods
and
when
we
got
our
money
it
was
all
in
a
lump
and
seemed
to
amount
to
something
brisbois
said
that
the
prospects
were
very
poor
indeed
for
the
price
of
fur
was
very
low
and
no
prospect
of
a
better
market
so
we
left
our
traps
still
on
storage
at
his
place
and
went
back
again
this
was
in
and
before
spring
the
war
was
being
pushed
in
mexico
i
tried
to
enlist
for
this
service
but
there
were
so
many
ahead
of
me
i
could
not
get
a
chance
i
still
worked
in
the
settlement
and
made
a
living
but
had
no
chance
to
improve
my
land
the
next
winter
i
lived
with
mr
bennett
hunted
deer
and
sold
them
at
mineral
point
and
in
this
way
made
and
saved
a
few
dollars
there
had
been
from
time
to
time
rumors
of
a
better
country
to
the
west
of
us
and
a
sort
of
a
pioneer
or
western
fever
would
break
out
among
the
people
occasionally
thus
in
i
had
a
slight
touch
of
the
disease
on
account
of
the
stories
they
told
us
about
oregon
it
was
reported
that
the
government
would
give
a
man
a
good
farm
if
he
would
go
and
settle
and
make
some
specified
improvement
they
said
it
was
in
a
territory
of
rich
soil
with
plenty
of
timber
fish
and
game
and
some
indians
just
to
give
a
little
spice
of
adventure
to
the
whole
thing
the
climate
was
very
mild
in
winter
as
they
reported
and
i
concluded
it
would
suit
me
exactly
i
began
at
once
to
think
about
an
outfit
and
a
journey
and
i
found
that
it
would
take
me
at
least
two
years
to
get
ready
a
trip
to
california
was
not
thought
of
in
those
days
for
it
did
not
belong
to
the
united
states
in
the
winter
of
news
began
to
come
that
there
was
gold
in
california
but
not
generally
believed
till
it
came
through
a
officer
and
then
as
the
people
were
used
to
mines
and
mining
a
regular
gold
fever
spread
as
if
by
swift
contagion
bennett
was
aroused
and
sold
his
farm
and
i
felt
a
change
in
my
oregon
desires
and
had
dreams
at
might
of
digging
up
the
yellow
dust
nothing
would
cure
us
then
but
a
trip
and
that
was
quickly
decided
on
as
it
would
be
some
weeks
yet
before
grass
would
start
i
concluded
to
haul
my
canoe
and
a
few
traps
over
to
a
branch
of
the
wisconsin
and
make
my
way
to
prairie
du
chien
do
a
little
trapping
get
me
an
indian
pony
on
which
to
ride
to
california
there
were
no
ponies
to
be
had
at
mineral
point
getting
a
ride
up
the
river
on
a
passing
steamboat
i
reached
prairie
la
crosse
where
the
only
house
was
that
of
a
dutch
trader
from
whom
i
bought
a
winnebago
pony
which
he
had
wintered
on
a
little
brushy
island
and
i
thought
if
he
could
winter
on
brush
and
rushes
he
must
be
tough
enough
to
take
me
across
the
plains
he
cost
me
and
i
found
him
to
be
a
poor
lazy
little
fellow
however
i
thought
that
when
he
got
some
good
grass
and
a
little
fat
on
his
ribs
he
might
have
more
life
and
so
i
hitched
a
rope
to
him
and
drove
him
ahead
down
the
river
when
i
came
to
the
bad
axe
river
i
found
it
swimming
full
but
had
no
trouble
in
crossing
as
the
pony
was
as
good
as
a
dog
in
the
water
before
leaving
bennett
i
had
my
gun
altered
over
to
a
pill
lock
and
secured
ammunition
to
last
for
two
years
i
had
tanned
some
nice
buckskin
and
had
a
good
outfit
of
clothes
made
of
it
or
rather
cut
and
made
it
myself
where
i
crossed
the
bad
axe
was
a
the
battle
ground
where
gen
dodge
fought
the
winnebago
indians
at
prairie
du
chien
i
found
a
letter
from
bennett
saying
that
the
grass
was
so
backward
he
would
not
start
up
for
two
or
three
weeks
and
i
had
better
come
back
and
start
with
them
but
as
the
letter
bore
no
date
i
could
only
guess
at
the
exact
time
i
had
intended
to
strike
directly
west
from
here
to
council
bluffs
and
meet
them
there
but
now
thought
perhaps
i
had
better
go
back
to
mineral
point
and
start
out
with
them
there
or
follow
on
rapidly
after
them
if
by
any
chance
they
had
already
started
on
my
way
back
i
found
the
kickapoo
river
too
high
to
ford
so
i
pulled
some
basswood
bark
and
made
a
raft
of
a
couple
of
logs
on
which
to
carry
my
gun
and
blanket
starting
the
pony
across
i
followed
after
he
swam
across
quickly
but
did
not
seem
to
like
it
on
the
other
side
so
before
i
got
across
back
he
came
again
not
paying
the
least
attention
to
my
scolding
i
went
back
with
the
raft
which
drifted
a
good
way
down
stream
and
caught
the
rascal
and
started
him
over
again
but
when
i
got
half
way
across
he
jumped
and
played
the
same
joke
on
me
again
i
began
to
think
of
the
old
puzzle
of
the
story
of
the
man
with
the
fox
the
goose
and
a
peck
of
corn
but
i
solved
it
by
making
a
basswood
rope
to
which
i
tied
a
stone
and
threw
across
then
sending
the
pony
over
with
the
other
end
he
staid
this
time
and
after
three
days
of
swimming
streams
and
pretty
hard
travel
reached
mineral
point
to
find
bennett
had
been
gone
two
weeks
and
had
taken
my
outfit
with
him
as
we
first
planned
i
was
a
little
troubled
but
set
out
light
loaded
for
dubuque
crossed
the
river
there
and
then
alone
across
iowa
over
wet
and
muddy
roads
till
i
fell
in
with
some
wagons
west
of
the
desmoines
river
they
were
from
milwaukee
owned
by
a
blodgett
and
i
camped
with
them
a
few
nights
till
we
got
to
the
missouri
river
i
rushed
ahead
the
last
day
or
two
and
got
there
before
them
there
were
a
few
california
wagons
here
and
some
campers
so
i
put
my
pony
out
to
grass
and
looked
around
i
waded
across
the
low
bottom
to
a
strip
of
dry
land
next
to
the
river
where
there
was
a
post
office
store
and
a
few
cabins
i
looked
first
for
a
letter
but
there
was
none
then
i
began
to
look
over
the
cards
in
the
trading
places
and
saloons
and
read
the
names
written
on
the
logs
of
the
houses
and
everywhere
i
thought
there
might
be
a
trace
of
the
friends
i
sought
no
one
had
seen
or
knew
them
after
looking
half
a
day
i
waded
back
again
to
the
pony
pretty
blue
i
thought
first
i
would
go
back
and
wait
another
year
but
there
was
a
small
train
near
where
i
left
the
pony
and
it
was
not
considered
very
safe
to
go
beyond
there
except
with
a
pretty
good
train
i
sat
down
in
camp
and
turned
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
and
talked
with
chas
dallas
of
lynn
iowa
who
owned
the
train
bennett
had
my
outfit
and
gun
while
i
had
his
light
gun
a
small
light
tent
a
frying
pan
a
tin
cup
one
woolen
shirt
and
the
clothes
on
my
back
having
no
money
to
get
another
outfit
i
about
concluded
to
turn
back
when
dallas
said
that
if
i
would
drive
one
of
his
teams
through
he
would
board
me
and
i
could
turn
my
pony
in
with
his
loose
horses
i
thought
it
over
and
finally
put
my
things
in
the
wagon
and
took
the
ox
whip
to
go
on
dallas
intended
to
get
provision
here
but
could
not
so
we
went
down
to
jo
following
the
river
near
the
bluff
we
camped
near
town
and
walked
in
finding
a
small
train
on
the
main
emigrant
road
to
the
west
my
team
was
one
yoke
of
oxen
and
one
yoke
of
cows
i
knew
how
to
drive
but
had
a
little
trouble
with
the
strange
animals
till
they
found
i
was
kind
to
them
and
then
they
were
all
right
this
was
in
a
slave
state
and
here
i
saw
the
first
negro
auction
one
side
of
the
street
had
a
platform
such
as
we
build
for
a
political
speaker
the
auctioneer
mounted
this
with
a
black
boy
about
years
old
and
after
he
had
told
all
his
good
qualities
and
had
the
boy
stand
up
bold
and
straight
he
called
for
bids
and
they
started
him
at
he
rattled
away
as
if
he
were
selling
a
steer
and
when
rubideaux
the
founder
of
jo
bid
he
went
no
higher
and
the
boy
was
sold
with
my
new
england
notions
it
made
quite
an
impression
on
me
here
dallas
got
his
supplies
and
when
the
flour
and
bacon
was
loaded
up
the
ferryman
wanted
to
take
the
train
across
this
dallas
thought
too
high
and
went
back
up
the
river
a
day
drive
where
he
got
across
for
from
this
crossing
we
went
across
the
country
without
much
of
a
road
till
we
struck
the
road
from
jo
and
were
soon
on
the
platte
bottom
we
found
some
fine
strawberries
at
one
of
the
camps
across
the
country
we
found
some
hills
but
now
the
country
was
all
one
vast
prairie
not
a
tree
in
sight
till
we
reached
the
platte
there
some
cottonwood
and
willow
at
the
first
camp
on
the
platte
i
rolled
up
in
my
blanket
under
the
wagon
and
thought
more
than
i
slept
but
i
was
in
for
it
and
no
other
way
but
to
go
on
i
had
heard
that
there
were
two
forts
new
kearny
and
laramie
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
which
we
must
pass
before
we
reached
the
south
pass
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
beyond
there
there
would
be
no
place
to
buy
medicine
or
food
our
little
train
of
five
wagons
ten
men
one
woman
and
three
children
would
not
be
a
formidable
force
against
the
indians
if
they
were
disposed
to
molest
us
and
it
looked
to
me
very
hazardous
and
that
a
larger
train
would
be
more
safe
for
government
troops
were
seldom
molested
on
their
marches
if
i
should
not
please
dallas
and
get
turned
off
with
only
my
gun
and
pony
i
should
be
in
a
pretty
bad
shape
but
i
decided
to
keep
right
on
and
take
the
chances
on
the
savages
who
would
get
only
my
hair
and
my
gun
as
my
contribution
to
them
if
they
should
be
hostile
i
must
confess
however
that
the
trail
ahead
did
not
look
either
straight
or
bright
to
me
but
hoped
it
might
be
better
than
i
thought
so
i
yoked
my
oxen
and
cows
to
the
wagon
and
drove
on
all
the
other
teams
had
two
drivers
each
who
took
turns
and
thus
had
every
other
day
off
for
hunting
if
they
chose
but
i
had
to
carry
the
whip
every
day
and
leave
my
gun
in
the
wagon
when
we
crossed
salt
creek
the
banks
were
high
and
we
had
to
tie
a
strong
rope
to
the
wagons
and
with
a
few
turns
around
a
post
lower
them
down
easily
while
we
had
to
double
the
teams
to
get
them
up
the
other
side
night
came
on
before
half
the
wagons
were
over
and
though
it
did
not
rain
the
water
rose
before
morning
so
it
was
ten
feet
deep
we
made
a
boat
of
one
of
the
wagon
beds
and
had
a
regular
ferry
and
when
they
pulled
the
wagons
over
they
sank
below
the
surface
but
came
out
all
right
we
came
to
pawnee
village
on
the
platte
a
collection
of
mud
huts
oval
in
shape
and
an
entrance
low
down
to
crawl
in
at
a
ground
owl
and
some
prairie
dogs
were
in
one
of
them
and
we
suspected
they
might
be
winter
quarters
for
the
indians
dallas
and
his
family
rode
in
the
wagon
dick
field
was
cook
and
the
rest
of
us
drove
the
oxen
we
put
out
a
small
guard
at
night
to
watch
for
indians
and
keep
the
stock
together
so
there
might
be
no
delay
in
searching
for
them
when
several
miles
from
kearney
i
think
on
july
we
camped
near
the
river
where
there
was
a
slough
and
much
cottonwood
and
willow
just
after
sundown
a
horse
came
galloping
from
the
west
and
went
in
with
our
horses
that
were
feeding
a
little
farther
down
in
the
morning
two
soldiers
came
from
the
fort
inquiring
after
the
stray
horse
but
dallas
said
he
had
seen
none
and
they
did
not
hunt
around
among
the
willows
for
the
lost
animal
probably
it
would
be
the
easiest
way
to
report
back
to
the
fort
indians
got
him
when
we
hitched
up
in
the
morning
he
put
the
horse
on
the
off
side
of
his
own
and
when
near
the
fort
he
went
ahead
on
foot
and
entertained
the
officers
while
the
men
drove
by
and
the
horse
was
not
discovered
i
did
not
like
this
much
for
if
we
were
discovered
we
might
be
roughly
handled
and
perhaps
the
property
of
the
innocent
even
confiscated
really
my
new
england
ideas
of
honesty
were
somewhat
shocked
reaching
the
south
platte
it
took
us
all
day
to
ford
the
sandy
stream
as
we
had
first
to
sound
out
a
good
crossing
by
wading
through
ourselves
and
when
we
started
our
teams
across
we
dare
not
stop
a
moment
for
fear
the
wagons
would
sink
deep
into
the
quicksands
we
had
no
mishaps
in
crossing
and
when
well
camped
on
the
other
side
a
solitary
buffalo
made
his
appearance
about
yards
away
and
all
hands
started
after
him
some
on
foot
the
horsemen
soon
got
ahead
of
him
but
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
get
out
of
their
way
so
they
opened
fire
on
him
he
still
kept
his
feet
and
they
went
nearer
rogers
being
on
a
horse
with
a
blind
bridle
getting
near
enough
to
fire
his
revolver
at
him
when
he
turned
and
the
horse
being
unable
to
see
the
animal
quick
enough
to
get
out
of
the
way
suffered
the
force
of
a
sudden
attack
of
the
old
fellow
horns
and
came
out
with
a
gash
in
his
thigh
six
inches
long
while
rogers
went
on
a
flying
expedition
over
the
horse
head
and
did
some
lively
scrambling
when
he
reached
the
ground
the
rest
of
them
worried
him
along
for
about
half
a
mile
and
finally
after
about
forty
shots
he
lay
down
but
held
his
head
up
defiantly
receiving
shot
after
shot
with
an
angry
shake
till
a
side
shot
laid
him
out
this
game
gave
us
plenty
of
meat
which
though
tough
was
a
pleasant
change
from
bacon
i
took
no
part
in
this
battle
except
as
an
observer
on
examination
it
was
found
that
the
balls
had
been
many
of
them
stopped
by
the
matted
hair
about
the
old
fellow
head
and
none
of
them
had
reached
the
skull
a
few
days
after
this
we
were
stopped
entirely
by
a
herd
of
buffaloes
crossing
our
road
they
came
up
from
the
river
and
were
moving
south
the
smaller
animals
seemed
to
be
in
the
lead
and
the
rear
was
brought
up
by
the
old
cows
and
the
shaggy
burly
bulls
all
were
moving
at
a
smart
trot
with
tongues
hanging
out
and
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
us
though
we
stood
within
a
hundred
yards
of
them
we
had
to
stand
by
our
teams
and
stock
to
prevent
a
stampede
for
they
all
seemed
to
have
a
great
wonder
and
somewhat
of
fear
at
their
relatives
of
the
plains
after
this
we
often
saw
large
droves
of
them
in
the
distance
sometimes
we
could
see
what
in
the
distance
seemed
a
great
patch
of
brush
but
by
watching
closely
we
could
see
it
was
a
great
drove
of
these
animals
those
who
had
leisure
to
go
up
to
the
bluffs
often
reported
large
droves
in
sight
antelopes
were
also
seen
but
these
occupied
the
higher
ground
and
it
was
very
hard
to
get
near
enough
to
them
to
shoot
successfully
still
we
managed
to
get
a
good
deal
of
game
which
was
very
acceptable
as
food
one
prominent
land
mark
along
the
route
was
what
they
called
court
house
rock
standing
to
the
south
from
the
trail
and
much
resembled
an
immense
square
building
standing
high
above
surrounding
country
the
farther
we
went
on
the
more
plentiful
became
the
large
game
and
also
wolves
and
prairie
dogs
the
first
of
which
seemed
to
follow
the
buffaloes
closely
about
this
time
we
met
a
odd
looking
train
going
east
consisting
of
five
or
six
mormons
from
salt
lake
all
mounted
on
small
spanish
mules
they
were
dressed
in
buckskin
and
moccasins
with
long
spurs
jingling
at
their
heels
the
rowels
fully
four
inches
long
and
each
one
carried
a
gun
a
pistol
and
a
big
knife
they
were
rough
looking
fellows
with
long
matted
hair
long
beards
old
slouch
hats
and
a
generally
back
woods
air
in
every
way
they
had
an
extra
pack
mule
but
the
baggage
and
provisions
were
very
light
i
had
heard
much
about
the
mormons
both
at
nauvoo
and
salt
lake
and
some
way
or
other
i
could
not
separate
the
idea
of
horse
thieves
from
this
party
and
i
am
sure
i
would
not
like
to
meet
them
if
i
had
a
desirable
mule
that
they
wanted
or
any
money
or
a
good
looking
wife
we
talked
with
them
half
an
hour
or
so
and
then
moved
on
we
occasionally
passed
by
a
grave
along
the
road
and
often
a
small
head
board
would
state
that
the
poor
unfortunate
had
died
of
cholera
many
of
these
had
been
torn
open
by
wolves
and
the
blanket
encircling
the
corpse
partly
pulled
away
our
route
led
a
few
miles
north
of
chimney
rock
standing
on
an
elevated
point
like
a
tall
column
so
perfect
and
regular
on
all
sides
that
from
our
point
it
looked
as
if
it
might
be
the
work
of
the
stone
cutters
some
of
the
party
went
to
see
it
and
reported
there
was
no
way
to
ascend
it
and
that
as
far
as
a
man
could
reach
the
rocks
were
inscribed
with
the
names
of
visitors
and
travelers
who
passed
that
way
at
scott
bluffs
the
bluffs
came
close
to
the
river
so
there
was
considerable
hill
climbing
to
get
along
the
road
in
other
places
finding
ample
room
in
the
bottom
here
we
found
a
large
camp
of
the
sioux
indians
on
the
bank
of
a
ravine
on
both
sides
of
which
were
some
large
cottonwood
trees
away
up
in
the
large
limbs
platforms
had
been
made
of
poles
on
which
were
laid
the
bodies
of
their
dead
wrapped
in
blankets
and
fastened
down
to
the
platform
by
a
sort
of
a
network
of
smaller
poles
tightly
lashed
so
that
they
could
not
be
dragged
away
or
disturbed
by
wild
animals
this
seemed
a
strange
sort
of
cemetery
but
when
we
saw
the
desecrated
graves
we
felt
that
perhaps
this
was
the
best
way
even
if
it
was
a
savage
custom
these
indians
were
men
and
pretty
good
looking
for
red
men
some
of
our
men
went
over
to
their
camp
and
some
of
their
youths
came
down
to
ours
and
when
we
started
on
they
seemed
quite
proud
that
they
had
learned
a
little
of
the
english
language
but
the
extent
of
their
knowledge
seemed
to
be
a
little
learned
of
the
for
they
would
swing
their
hands
at
the
cattle
and
cry
out
whoa
haw
g
d
d
whether
they
knew
what
was
meant
i
have
my
doubts
they
seemed
pretty
well
provided
for
and
begged
very
little
as
they
are
apt
to
do
when
they
are
hard
pressed
we
saw
also
some
bands
of
pawnee
indians
on
the
move
across
the
prairies
they
would
hitch
a
long
light
pole
on
each
side
of
a
pony
with
the
ends
dragging
behind
on
the
ground
and
on
a
little
platform
at
the
hind
end
the
children
sat
and
were
dragged
along
as
we
passed
on
beyond
scott
bluff
the
game
began
to
be
perceptibly
scarcer
and
what
we
did
find
was
back
from
the
traveled
road
from
which
it
had
apparently
been
driven
by
the
passing
hunters
in
time
we
reached
laramie
a
trading
post
where
there
were
some
indian
lodges
and
we
noticed
that
some
of
the
occupants
had
lighter
complexions
than
any
of
the
other
indians
we
had
seen
they
had
cords
of
dried
buffalo
meat
and
we
purchased
some
it
was
very
fat
but
was
so
perfectly
cured
that
the
clear
tallow
tasted
as
sweet
as
a
nut
i
thought
it
was
the
best
dried
meat
i
had
ever
tasted
but
perhaps
a
good
appetite
had
something
to
do
with
it
as
we
passed
laramie
we
fell
in
company
with
some
soldiers
who
were
going
to
hall
and
thence
to
oregon
we
considered
them
pretty
safe
to
travel
with
and
kept
with
them
for
some
time
though
their
rate
of
travel
was
less
than
ours
among
them
were
some
mormons
employed
as
teamsters
and
in
other
ways
and
they
told
us
there
were
some
missourians
on
the
road
who
would
never
live
to
see
california
there
had
been
some
contests
between
the
missourians
and
the
mormons
and
i
felt
rather
glad
that
none
of
us
hailed
from
pike
county
we
turned
into
what
they
called
the
black
hills
leaving
the
platte
to
the
north
of
us
the
first
night
on
this
road
we
had
the
hardest
rain
i
ever
experienced
and
the
only
one
of
any
account
on
our
journey
our
camp
was
on
a
level
piece
of
ground
on
the
bank
of
a
dry
creek
which
soon
became
a
very
wet
creek
indeed
for
by
morning
it
was
one
hundred
yards
wide
and
absolutely
impassible
it
went
down
however
as
quickly
as
it
rose
and
by
ten
it
was
so
low
that
we
easily
crossed
and
went
on
our
way
we
crossed
one
stream
where
there
were
great
drifts
or
piles
of
hail
which
had
been
brought
down
by
a
heavy
storm
from
higher
up
the
hills
at
one
place
we
found
some
rounded
boulders
from
six
to
eight
inches
in
diameter
which
were
partly
hollow
and
broken
open
were
found
to
contain
most
beautiful
crystals
of
quartz
clear
as
purest
ice
the
inside
was
certainly
very
pretty
and
it
was
a
mystery
how
it
came
there
i
have
since
learned
that
such
stones
are
found
at
many
points
and
that
they
are
called
geodes
we
came
out
at
the
river
again
at
the
mouth
of
deer
creek
and
as
there
was
some
pretty
good
coal
there
quite
easy
to
get
we
made
camp
one
day
to
try
to
tighten
our
wagon
tires
john
rogers
acting
as
blacksmith
this
was
my
first
chance
to
reconnoiter
and
so
i
took
my
gun
and
went
up
the
creek
a
wide
treeless
bottom
in
the
ravines
on
the
south
side
were
beautiful
groves
of
small
fir
trees
and
some
thick
brush
wild
rose
bushes
i
think
i
found
here
a
good
many
heads
and
horns
of
elk
and
i
could
not
decide
whether
they
had
been
killed
in
winter
during
the
deep
snow
or
had
starved
to
death
there
was
a
ferry
here
to
cross
the
river
and
go
up
along
north
side
dallas
bought
the
whole
outfit
for
a
small
sum
and
when
we
were
safely
over
he
took
with
him
such
ropes
as
he
wanted
and
tied
the
boat
to
the
bank
the
road
on
this
side
was
very
sandy
and
led
over
and
among
some
rolling
hills
in
talking
with
the
men
of
the
troops
in
whose
company
we
still
were
i
gathered
much
information
concerning
our
road
further
west
they
said
we
were
entirely
too
late
to
get
through
to
california
on
account
of
crossing
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
which
they
said
would
be
covered
with
snow
by
november
or
even
earlier
and
that
we
would
be
compelled
to
winter
at
salt
lake
some
of
the
drivers
overheard
dallas
telling
his
family
the
same
thing
and
that
if
he
should
winter
at
salt
lake
he
would
discharge
his
drivers
as
soon
as
he
arrived
as
he
could
not
afford
to
board
them
all
winter
this
was
bad
news
for
me
for
i
had
known
of
the
history
of
them
at
nauvoo
and
in
missouri
and
the
prospect
of
being
thrown
among
them
with
no
money
to
buy
bread
was
a
very
sorry
prospect
for
me
from
all
i
could
learn
we
could
not
get
a
chance
to
work
even
for
our
board
there
and
the
other
drivers
shared
my
fears
and
disappointment
in
this
dilemma
we
called
a
council
and
invited
the
gentleman
in
to
have
an
understanding
he
came
and
our
spokesman
stated
the
case
to
him
and
our
fears
and
asked
him
what
he
had
to
say
to
us
about
it
he
flew
quite
angry
at
us
and
talked
some
and
swore
a
great
deal
more
and
the
burden
of
his
speech
was
this
train
belongs
to
me
and
i
propose
to
do
with
it
just
as
i
have
a
mind
to
and
i
do
care
a
d
n
what
you
fellows
do
or
say
i
am
not
going
to
board
you
fellows
all
winter
for
nothing
and
when
we
get
to
salt
lake
you
can
go
where
you
please
for
i
shall
not
want
you
any
longer
we
talked
a
little
to
him
and
under
the
circumstances
to
talk
was
about
all
we
could
do
he
gave
us
no
satisfaction
and
left
us
apparently
much
offended
that
we
had
any
care
for
ourselves
then
we
had
some
talk
among
ourselves
at
the
time
and
from
day
to
day
as
we
moved
along
we
began
to
think
that
the
only
way
to
get
along
at
all
in
salt
lake
would
be
to
turn
mormons
and
none
of
us
had
any
belief
or
desire
that
way
and
could
not
make
up
our
minds
to
stop
our
journey
and
lose
so
much
time
and
if
we
were
not
very
favored
travelers
our
lot
might
be
cast
among
the
sinners
for
all
time
we
were
now
on
the
sweetwater
river
and
began
to
see
the
snow
on
the
rocky
mountains
ahead
of
us
another
reminder
that
there
was
a
winter
coming
and
only
a
little
more
than
half
our
journey
was
done
we
did
not
feel
very
happy
over
it
and
yet
we
had
to
laugh
once
in
a
while
at
some
of
the
funny
things
that
would
happen
the
government
party
we
were
with
had
among
them
a
german
mule
driver
who
had
a
deal
of
trouble
with
his
team
but
who
had
a
very
little
knowledge
of
the
english
language
when
the
officers
tried
to
instruct
him
a
little
he
seemed
to
get
out
of
patience
and
would
say
something
very
like
we
did
not
know
exactly
what
this
meant
we
had
heard
there
was
a
river
of
that
name
or
something
very
near
like
that
and
then
again
some
said
that
was
the
dutch
for
swearing
if
this
latter
was
the
truth
then
he
was
a
very
profane
mule
driver
when
he
got
mad
the
captain
of
the
company
had
a
very
nice
looking
lady
with
him
and
they
carried
a
fine
wall
tent
which
they
occupied
when
they
went
into
camp
the
company
cook
served
their
meals
to
them
in
the
privacy
of
their
tent
and
they
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
very
nicely
everybody
thought
the
captain
was
very
lucky
in
having
such
an
accomplished
companion
and
journey
along
quietly
to
the
gold
fields
at
government
expense
there
seemed
to
be
just
a
little
jealousy
between
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
and
one
day
i
saw
them
both
standing
in
angry
attitude
before
the
captain
quarters
both
mounted
with
their
carbines
lying
across
their
saddles
before
them
they
had
some
pretty
sharp
hot
words
and
it
looked
as
if
they
both
were
pretty
nearly
warmed
up
to
the
shooting
point
once
the
lieutenant
moved
his
right
hand
a
little
and
the
captain
was
quick
to
see
it
shouting
let
your
gun
alone
or
i
will
make
a
hole
through
you
at
the
same
time
grasping
his
own
and
pointing
it
straight
at
the
other
officer
during
all
this
time
the
captain
lady
stood
in
the
tent
door
and
when
she
saw
her
favorite
had
the
drop
on
the
lieutenant
she
clapped
her
delicate
little
hands
in
a
gleeful
manner
just
look
at
the
captain
ai
he
spunky
and
then
she
laughed
long
and
loud
to
see
her
lord
show
so
much
military
courage
she
seemed
more
pleased
at
the
affair
than
any
one
else
i
do
know
exactly
what
the
others
thought
but
i
never
could
believe
that
the
lady
and
the
captain
were
ever
married
the
lieutenant
was
no
coward
but
probably
thinking
that
prudence
was
the
better
part
of
valor
refrained
from
handling
his
gun
and
the
two
soon
rode
away
in
opposite
directions
we
passed
a
lone
rock
standing
in
the
river
bottom
on
the
sweetwater
which
they
named
independence
rock
it
was
covered
with
the
names
of
thousands
of
people
who
had
gone
by
on
that
road
some
were
pretty
neatly
chiseled
in
some
very
rudely
scrawled
and
some
put
on
with
paint
i
spent
all
the
time
i
could
hunting
bennett
name
but
i
could
not
find
it
anywhere
to
have
found
his
name
and
thus
to
know
that
he
had
safely
passed
this
point
would
have
been
a
little
in
those
rather
doubtful
days
some
had
named
the
date
of
their
passing
and
some
of
them
were
probably
pretty
near
the
gold
fields
at
this
time
all
along
in
this
section
we
found
alkali
water
near
the
road
some
very
strong
and
dangerous
for
man
or
beast
to
use
we
traveled
on
up
the
sweetwater
for
some
time
and
at
last
came
to
a
place
where
the
road
left
the
river
and
we
had
a
long
hard
hill
to
pull
up
when
we
reached
the
top
of
this
we
were
in
the
south
pass
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
backbone
of
the
american
continent
to
the
north
of
us
were
some
very
high
peaks
white
with
snow
and
to
the
south
were
some
lower
hills
and
valleys
the
summit
of
the
mountains
was
not
quite
as
imposing
as
i
expected
but
it
was
the
summit
and
we
were
soon
surely
moving
down
the
western
side
for
at
pacific
springs
the
water
ran
to
the
westward
toward
the
pacific
coast
the
next
day
we
came
to
the
nearly
dry
bed
of
the
river
the
big
sandy
the
country
round
about
seemed
volcanic
with
no
timber
but
plenty
of
sage
brush
in
which
we
were
able
to
shoot
an
occasional
sage
hen
the
river
bed
itself
was
nothing
but
sand
and
where
there
was
water
enough
to
wet
it
it
was
very
miry
and
hard
traveling
over
it
there
are
two
streams
the
big
sandy
and
little
sandy
both
tributaries
to
green
river
which
we
soon
reached
and
crossed
it
was
a
remarkable
clear
and
rapid
stream
and
was
now
low
enough
to
ford
one
of
the
government
teams
set
out
to
make
the
crossing
at
a
point
where
it
looked
shallow
enough
but
before
the
lead
mules
reached
the
opposite
shore
they
lost
their
footing
and
were
forced
to
swim
of
course
the
wagon
stopped
and
the
team
swung
round
and
tangled
up
in
a
bad
shape
they
were
unhitched
and
the
wagon
pulled
back
the
load
was
somewhat
dampened
for
the
water
came
into
the
wagon
box
about
a
foot
we
camped
here
and
laid
by
one
day
having
thus
quite
a
little
chance
to
look
around
when
we
came
to
the
first
water
that
flowed
toward
the
pacific
coast
at
pacific
springs
we
drivers
had
quite
a
little
talk
about
a
new
scheme
we
put
a
great
many
ifs
together
and
they
amounted
to
about
this
if
this
stream
were
large
enough
if
we
had
a
boat
if
we
knew
the
way
if
there
were
no
falls
or
bad
places
if
we
had
plenty
of
provisions
if
we
were
bold
enough
set
out
on
such
a
trip
we
might
come
out
at
some
point
or
other
on
the
pacific
ocean
and
now
when
we
came
to
the
first
of
the
ifs
a
stream
large
enough
to
float
a
small
boat
we
began
to
think
more
strongly
about
the
other
ifs
in
the
course
of
our
rambles
we
actually
did
run
across
the
second
if
in
the
shape
of
a
small
ferry
boat
filled
up
with
sand
upon
a
bar
and
it
did
not
take
very
long
to
dig
it
out
and
put
it
into
shape
to
use
for
it
was
just
large
enough
to
hold
one
wagon
at
a
time
our
military
escort
intended
to
leave
us
at
this
point
as
their
route
now
bore
off
to
the
north
of
ours
i
had
a
long
talk
with
the
surgeon
who
seemed
well
informed
about
the
country
and
asked
him
about
the
prospects
he
did
not
give
the
mormons
a
very
good
name
he
said
to
me
if
you
go
to
salt
lake
city
do
not
let
them
know
you
are
from
missouri
for
i
tell
you
that
many
of
those
from
that
state
will
never
see
california
you
know
they
were
driven
from
missouri
and
will
get
revenge
if
they
can
both
the
surgeon
and
the
captain
said
the
stream
came
out
on
the
pacific
coast
and
that
we
had
no
obstacles
except
cataracts
which
they
had
heard
were
pretty
bad
i
then
went
to
dallas
and
told
him
what
we
proposed
doing
and
to
our
surprise
he
did
not
offer
any
objections
and
offered
me
for
my
pony
he
said
he
would
sell
us
some
flour
and
bacon
for
provisions
also
we
helped
them
in
crossing
the
river
which
was
somewhat
difficult
being
swift
with
boulders
in
the
bottom
but
we
got
all
safely
over
and
then
made
the
trade
we
had
spoken
of
dallas
paid
me
for
my
pony
and
we
took
what
flour
and
bacon
he
would
let
go
he
gave
us
some
ropes
for
head
and
stern
lines
to
our
boat
and
a
couple
of
axes
and
we
laid
these
and
our
provisions
in
a
pile
by
the
roadside
six
of
us
then
gave
up
our
whips
mcmahon
a
driver
hesitated
for
some
time
but
being
pressed
by
dallas
for
a
decision
at
last
threw
down
his
whip
and
said
i
will
go
with
the
boys
this
left
dallas
with
only
one
driver
but
he
took
a
whip
himself
and
with
the
aid
of
the
children
and
his
wife
who
drove
the
wagon
they
got
along
very
well
i
paid
for
such
provisions
as
we
had
taken
as
the
rest
of
the
fellows
had
almost
no
money
so
we
parted
company
the
little
train
slowly
moving
on
its
way
westward
our
military
captain
the
soldier
boys
and
the
gay
young
lady
taking
the
route
to
oregon
and
we
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
river
whose
waters
flowed
to
the
great
pacific
each
company
wished
the
other
good
luck
we
took
a
few
long
breaths
and
then
set
to
work
in
earnest
to
carry
out
our
plans
chapter
viii
about
the
first
thing
we
did
was
to
organize
and
select
a
captain
and
very
much
against
my
wishes
i
was
chosen
to
this
important
position
six
of
us
had
guns
of
some
sort
richard
field
dallas
cook
was
not
armed
at
all
we
had
one
regular
axe
and
a
large
camp
hatchet
which
was
about
the
same
as
an
axe
and
several
very
small
hatchets
owned
by
the
men
all
our
worldly
goods
were
piled
up
on
the
bank
and
we
were
alone
an
examination
of
the
old
ferry
boat
showed
it
to
be
in
pretty
good
condition
the
sand
with
which
it
had
been
filled
keeping
it
very
perfectly
we
found
two
oars
in
the
sand
under
the
boat
and
looked
up
some
poles
to
assist
us
in
navigation
our
cordage
was
rather
scant
but
the
best
we
could
get
and
all
we
could
muster
the
boat
was
about
twelve
feet
long
and
six
or
seven
feet
wide
not
a
very
well
proportioned
craft
but
having
the
ability
to
carry
a
pretty
good
load
we
swung
it
up
to
the
bank
and
loaded
up
our
goods
and
then
ourselves
it
was
not
a
heavy
load
for
the
craft
and
it
looked
as
if
we
were
taking
the
most
sensible
way
to
get
to
the
pacific
and
almost
wondered
that
everybody
was
so
blind
as
not
to
see
it
as
we
did
this
party
was
composed
of
manley
mcmahon
charles
and
joseph
hazelrig
richard
field
alfred
walton
and
john
rogers
we
untied
the
ropes
gave
the
boat
a
push
and
commenced
to
move
down
the
river
with
ease
and
comfort
feeling
much
happier
than
we
would
had
we
been
going
toward
salt
lake
with
the
prospect
of
wintering
there
at
the
mouth
of
ham
fork
we
passed
a
camp
of
indians
but
we
kept
close
to
the
opposite
shore
to
avoid
being
boarded
by
them
they
beckoned
very
urgently
for
us
to
come
ashore
but
i
acted
as
if
i
did
not
understand
them
and
gave
them
the
as
we
were
floating
down
the
rapid
stream
it
became
more
and
more
a
rapid
roaring
river
and
the
bed
contained
many
dangerous
rocks
that
were
difficult
to
shun
each
of
us
had
a
and
we
ranged
ourselves
along
the
sides
of
the
boat
and
tried
to
keep
ourselves
clear
from
the
rocks
and
dangers
the
water
was
not
very
deep
and
made
such
a
dashing
noise
as
the
current
rushed
among
the
rocks
that
one
had
to
talk
pretty
loud
to
be
heard
as
we
were
gliding
along
quite
swiftly
i
set
my
pole
on
the
bottom
and
gave
the
boat
a
sudden
push
to
avoid
a
boulder
when
the
pole
stuck
in
the
crevice
between
two
rocks
and
instead
of
losing
the
pole
by
the
sudden
jerk
i
gave
i
was
the
one
who
was
very
suddenly
yanked
from
the
boat
by
the
spring
of
the
pole
and
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
river
i
struck
pretty
squarely
on
my
back
and
so
got
thoroughly
wet
but
swam
for
shore
amid
the
shouts
of
the
boys
who
waved
their
hats
and
hurrahed
for
the
captain
when
they
saw
he
was
not
hurt
i
told
them
that
was
nothing
as
we
were
on
our
way
to
california
by
water
any
way
and
such
things
must
be
expected
the
next
day
after
this
i
went
on
shore
and
sighted
a
couple
of
antelope
one
of
which
i
shot
which
gave
us
good
grub
and
good
appetites
we
already
had
as
near
as
we
could
estimate
we
floated
about
thirty
miles
a
day
which
beat
the
pace
of
tired
oxen
considerably
in
one
place
there
was
a
fringe
of
thick
willows
along
the
bank
and
a
little
farther
back
a
perpendicular
bluff
while
between
the
two
was
a
strip
of
fine
green
grass
as
we
were
passing
this
we
scared
up
a
band
of
elk
in
this
grass
meadow
and
they
all
took
a
run
down
the
river
like
a
band
of
horses
one
of
them
turned
up
a
small
ravine
with
walls
so
steep
he
could
not
get
out
so
we
posted
a
guard
at
the
entrance
and
three
of
us
went
up
the
cañon
after
him
and
after
the
others
had
each
fired
a
shot
i
fired
the
third
and
brought
him
down
this
was
about
the
finest
piece
of
rocky
mountain
beef
that
one
could
see
we
took
the
carcass
on
board
and
floated
on
again
thus
far
we
had
a
very
pleasant
time
each
taking
his
turn
in
working
the
boat
while
the
others
rested
or
slept
about
the
fifth
day
when
we
were
floating
along
in
very
gently
running
water
i
had
lay
down
to
take
a
rest
and
a
little
sleep
the
mountains
here
on
both
sides
of
the
river
were
not
very
steep
but
ran
gradually
for
a
mile
or
so
while
i
was
sleeping
the
boat
came
around
a
small
angle
in
the
stream
and
all
at
once
there
seemed
to
be
a
higher
steeper
range
of
mountains
right
across
the
valley
the
boys
thought
the
river
was
coming
to
a
rather
sudden
end
and
hastily
awoke
me
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
say
they
were
not
right
for
there
was
no
way
in
sight
for
it
to
go
to
i
remembered
while
looking
over
a
map
the
military
men
had
i
found
a
place
named
brown
hole
and
i
told
the
boys
i
guessed
we
were
elected
to
go
on
foot
to
california
after
all
for
i
did
not
propose
to
follow
the
river
down
any
sort
of
a
hole
into
any
mountain
we
were
floating
directly
toward
a
perpendicular
cliff
and
i
could
not
see
any
hole
any
where
nor
any
other
place
where
it
could
go
just
as
we
were
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
cliff
the
river
turned
sharply
to
the
right
and
went
behind
a
high
point
of
the
mountain
that
seemed
to
stand
squarely
on
edge
this
was
really
an
immense
crack
or
crevice
certainly
feet
deep
and
perhaps
much
more
and
seemed
much
wider
at
the
bottom
than
it
did
at
the
top
feet
or
more
above
our
heads
each
wall
seemed
to
lean
in
toward
the
water
as
it
rose
we
were
now
for
some
time
between
two
rocky
walls
between
which
the
river
ran
very
rapidly
and
we
often
had
to
get
out
and
work
our
boat
over
the
rocks
sometimes
lifting
it
off
when
it
caught
fortunately
we
had
a
good
tow
line
and
one
would
take
this
and
follow
along
the
edge
when
it
was
so
he
could
walk
the
mountains
seemed
to
get
higher
and
higher
on
both
sides
as
we
advanced
and
in
places
we
could
see
quite
a
number
of
trees
overhanging
the
river
and
away
up
on
the
rocks
we
could
see
the
wild
mountain
sheep
looking
down
at
us
they
were
so
high
that
they
seemed
a
mile
away
and
consequently
safe
enough
this
was
their
home
and
they
seemed
very
independent
as
if
they
dared
us
fellows
to
come
and
see
them
there
was
an
old
cottonwood
tree
on
bank
with
marks
of
an
axe
on
it
but
this
was
all
the
sign
we
saw
that
any
one
had
ever
been
here
before
us
we
got
no
game
while
passing
through
this
deep
cañon
and
began
to
feel
the
need
of
some
fresh
provisions
very
sorely
we
passed
many
deep
dark
cañons
coming
into
the
main
stream
and
at
one
place
where
the
rock
hung
a
little
over
the
river
and
had
a
smooth
wall
i
climbed
up
above
the
high
water
mark
which
we
could
clearly
see
and
with
a
mixture
of
gunpowder
and
grease
for
paint
and
a
bit
of
cloth
tied
to
a
stick
for
a
brush
i
painted
in
fair
sized
letters
on
the
rock
capt
manley
we
did
not
know
whether
we
were
within
the
bounds
of
the
united
states
or
not
and
we
put
on
all
the
majesty
we
could
under
the
circumstances
i
do
think
the
sun
ever
shone
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
for
the
sides
were
literally
for
the
sky
and
a
very
small
portion
of
that
was
all
we
could
see
just
before
night
we
came
to
a
place
where
some
huge
rocks
as
large
as
cabins
had
fallen
down
from
the
mountain
completely
filling
up
the
river
bed
and
making
it
completely
impassible
for
our
boat
we
unloaded
it
and
while
the
boys
held
the
stern
line
i
took
off
my
clothes
and
pushed
the
boat
out
into
the
torrent
which
ran
around
the
rocks
letting
them
pay
the
line
out
slowly
till
it
was
just
right
then
i
sang
out
to
let
go
and
away
it
dashed
i
grasped
the
bow
line
and
at
the
first
chance
jumped
overboard
and
got
to
shore
when
i
held
the
boat
and
brought
it
in
below
the
obstructions
there
was
some
deep
water
below
the
rocks
and
we
went
into
camp
while
some
loaded
the
boat
others
with
a
hook
and
line
caught
some
good
fish
which
resembled
mackerel
while
i
was
looking
up
toward
the
mountain
top
and
along
down
the
rocky
wall
i
saw
a
smooth
place
about
fifty
feet
above
where
the
great
rocks
had
broken
out
and
there
painted
in
large
black
letters
were
the
words
ashley
this
was
the
first
real
evidence
we
had
of
the
presence
of
a
white
man
in
this
wild
place
and
from
this
record
it
seems
that
years
before
some
venturesome
man
had
here
inscribed
his
name
i
have
since
heard
there
were
some
persons
in
louis
of
this
name
and
of
some
circumstances
which
may
link
them
with
this
early
traveler
when
we
came
to
look
around
we
found
that
another
big
rock
blocked
the
channel
yards
below
and
the
water
rushed
around
it
with
a
terrible
swirl
so
we
unloaded
the
boat
again
and
made
the
attempt
to
get
around
it
as
we
did
the
other
rocks
we
tried
to
get
across
the
river
but
failed
we
now
all
but
one
got
on
the
great
rock
with
our
poles
and
the
one
man
was
to
ease
the
boat
down
with
the
rope
as
far
as
he
could
then
let
go
and
we
would
stop
it
with
our
poles
and
push
it
out
into
the
stream
and
let
it
go
over
but
the
current
was
so
strong
that
when
the
boat
struck
the
rock
we
could
not
stop
it
and
the
gunwale
next
to
us
rose
and
the
other
went
down
so
that
in
a
second
the
boat
stood
edgewise
in
the
water
and
the
bottom
tight
against
the
big
rock
and
the
strong
current
pinned
it
there
so
tight
that
we
could
no
more
move
it
than
we
could
move
the
rock
itself
this
seemed
a
very
sudden
ending
to
our
voyage
and
there
were
some
very
rapid
thoughts
as
to
whether
we
would
not
safer
among
the
mormons
than
out
in
this
wild
country
afoot
and
alone
our
boat
was
surely
lost
beyond
hope
and
something
must
be
done
i
saw
two
pine
trees
about
two
feet
through
growing
on
a
level
place
just
below
and
i
said
to
them
that
we
must
decide
between
going
afoot
and
making
some
canoes
out
of
these
pine
trees
canoes
were
decided
on
and
we
never
let
the
axes
rest
night
or
day
till
we
had
them
completed
while
my
working
shift
was
off
i
took
an
hour
or
two
for
a
little
hunting
and
on
a
low
divide
partly
grown
over
with
small
pines
and
juniper
i
found
signs
old
and
new
of
many
elk
and
so
concluded
the
country
was
well
stocked
with
noble
game
the
two
canoes
when
completed
were
about
fifteen
feet
long
and
two
feet
wide
and
we
lashed
them
together
for
greater
security
when
we
tried
them
we
found
they
were
too
small
to
carry
our
load
and
us
and
we
landed
half
a
mile
below
where
there
were
two
other
pine
trees
white
pine
about
two
feet
through
and
much
taller
than
the
ones
we
had
used
we
set
at
work
making
a
large
canoe
of
these
i
had
to
direct
the
work
for
i
was
the
only
one
who
had
ever
done
such
work
we
worked
night
and
day
at
these
canoes
keeping
a
big
fire
at
night
and
changing
off
to
keep
the
axes
busy
this
canoe
we
made
or
thirty
feet
long
and
when
completed
they
made
me
captain
of
it
and
into
it
loaded
the
most
valuable
things
such
as
provisions
ammunition
and
cooking
utensils
i
had
to
take
the
lead
for
i
was
the
only
skillful
canoeist
in
the
party
we
agreed
upon
signals
to
give
when
danger
was
seen
or
game
in
sight
and
leading
off
with
my
big
canoe
we
set
sail
again
and
went
flying
down
stream
this
rapid
rate
soon
brought
us
out
of
the
high
mountains
and
into
a
narrow
valley
when
the
stream
became
more
moderate
in
its
speed
and
we
floated
along
easily
enough
in
a
little
while
after
we
struck
this
slack
water
as
we
were
rounding
a
point
i
saw
on
a
sand
bar
in
the
river
five
or
six
elk
standing
and
looking
at
us
with
much
curiosity
i
signaled
for
those
behind
to
go
to
shore
while
i
did
the
same
and
two
or
three
of
us
took
our
guns
and
went
carefully
down
along
the
bank
the
thick
brush
hiding
us
from
them
till
we
were
in
fair
range
then
selecting
our
game
we
fired
on
them
a
fine
doe
fell
on
the
opposite
bank
and
a
magnificent
buck
which
rogers
and
i
selected
went
below
and
crossed
the
river
on
our
side
we
followed
him
down
along
the
bank
which
was
here
a
flat
meadow
with
thick
bunches
of
willows
and
soon
came
pretty
near
to
elk
who
started
off
on
a
high
and
lofty
trot
as
he
passed
an
opening
in
the
bushes
i
put
a
ball
through
his
head
and
he
fell
he
was
a
monster
rogers
who
was
a
butcher
said
it
would
weigh
five
hundred
or
six
hundred
pounds
the
horns
were
fully
six
feet
long
and
by
placing
the
horns
on
the
ground
point
downwards
one
could
walk
under
the
skull
between
them
we
packed
the
meat
to
our
canoes
and
staid
up
all
night
cutting
the
meat
in
strips
and
drying
it
to
reduce
bulk
and
preserve
it
and
it
made
the
finest
kind
of
food
fit
for
an
epicure
starting
on
again
the
river
lost
more
and
more
of
of
its
rapidity
as
it
came
out
into
a
still
wider
valley
and
became
quite
sluggish
we
picked
red
berries
that
grew
on
bushes
that
overhung
the
water
they
were
sour
and
might
have
been
high
cranberries
one
day
i
killed
an
otter
and
afterward
hearing
a
wild
goose
on
shore
i
went
for
the
game
and
killed
it
on
a
small
pond
on
which
there
were
also
some
mallard
duck
i
killed
two
of
these
when
i
fired
the
ones
not
killed
did
not
fly
away
but
rather
swam
toward
me
i
suppose
they
never
before
had
seen
a
man
or
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
on
the
shore
around
the
place
i
saw
a
small
bear
track
but
i
did
not
have
time
to
look
for
his
bearship
and
left
with
the
game
already
killed
and
passed
on
down
through
this
beautiful
valley
we
saw
one
place
where
a
large
band
of
horses
had
crossed
and
as
the
men
with
them
must
have
had
a
raft
we
were
pretty
sure
that
the
men
in
charge
of
them
were
white
men
another
day
we
passed
the
mouth
of
a
swollen
stream
which
came
in
from
the
west
side
the
water
was
thick
with
mud
and
the
fish
about
a
foot
long
came
to
the
top
with
their
noses
out
of
water
we
tried
to
catch
some
but
could
not
hold
them
one
night
we
camped
on
an
island
and
i
took
my
gun
and
went
over
toward
the
west
side
where
i
killed
a
deer
the
boys
hearing
me
shoot
came
out
guns
in
hand
thinking
i
might
need
help
and
i
was
very
glad
of
their
assistance
to
make
our
flour
go
as
far
as
possible
we
ate
very
freely
of
meat
and
having
excellent
appetites
it
disappeared
very
fast
it
took
us
two
or
three
days
to
pass
this
beautiful
valley
and
then
we
began
to
get
into
a
rougher
country
again
the
cañons
deeper
and
the
water
more
tumultuous
mcmahon
and
i
had
the
lead
always
in
the
big
canoe
the
mountains
seemed
to
change
into
bare
rocks
and
get
higher
and
higher
as
we
floated
along
after
the
first
day
of
this
the
river
became
so
full
of
boulders
that
many
times
the
only
way
we
could
do
was
to
unload
the
canoes
and
haul
them
over
load
up
and
go
ahead
only
to
repeat
the
same
tactics
in
a
very
short
time
again
at
one
place
where
the
river
was
more
than
usually
obstructed
we
found
a
deserted
camp
a
skiff
and
some
heavy
cooking
utensils
with
a
notice
posted
up
on
an
alder
tree
saying
that
they
had
found
the
river
route
impracticable
and
being
satisfied
that
the
river
was
so
full
of
rocks
and
boulders
that
it
could
not
be
safely
navigated
they
had
abandoned
the
undertaking
and
were
about
to
start
overland
to
make
their
way
to
salt
lake
i
took
down
the
names
of
the
parties
at
the
time
in
my
diary
which
has
since
been
burned
but
have
now
forgotten
them
entirely
they
were
all
strangers
to
me
they
had
taken
left
such
heavy
articles
as
could
not
be
carried
on
foot
this
notice
rather
disconcerted
us
but
we
thought
we
had
better
keep
on
and
see
for
ourselves
so
we
did
not
follow
them
but
kept
on
down
the
rocky
river
we
found
generally
more
boulders
than
water
and
the
down
grade
of
the
river
bed
was
heavy
some
alders
and
willows
grew
upon
the
bank
and
up
quite
high
on
the
mountains
we
could
see
a
little
timber
some
days
we
did
not
go
more
than
four
or
five
miles
and
that
was
serious
work
loading
and
unloading
our
canoes
and
packing
them
over
the
boulders
with
only
small
streams
of
water
curling
around
between
them
we
went
barefoot
most
of
the
time
for
we
were
more
than
half
of
the
time
in
the
water
which
roared
and
dashed
so
loud
that
we
could
hardly
heard
each
other
speak
we
kept
getting
more
and
more
venturesome
and
skillful
and
managed
to
run
some
very
dangerous
rapids
in
safety
on
the
high
peaks
above
our
heads
we
could
see
the
rocky
mountain
sheep
looking
defiantly
at
us
from
their
mountain
fastnesses
so
far
away
they
looked
no
larger
than
jack
rabbits
they
were
too
far
off
to
try
to
shoot
at
and
we
had
no
time
to
try
to
steal
up
any
nearer
for
at
the
rate
we
were
making
food
would
be
the
one
thing
needful
for
we
were
consuming
it
very
fast
sometimes
we
could
ride
a
little
ways
and
then
would
come
the
with
the
rocks
again
one
afternoon
we
came
to
a
sudden
turn
in
the
river
more
than
a
right
angle
and
just
below
a
fall
of
two
feet
or
more
this
i
ran
in
safety
as
did
the
rest
who
followed
and
we
cheered
at
our
pluck
and
skill
just
after
this
the
river
swung
back
the
other
way
at
a
right
angle
or
more
and
i
quickly
saw
there
was
danger
below
and
signaled
them
to
go
on
shore
at
once
and
lead
the
canoes
over
the
dangerous
rapids
i
ran
my
own
canoe
near
shore
and
got
by
the
rapid
safely
waiting
for
the
others
to
come
also
they
did
not
obey
my
signals
but
thought
to
run
the
rapid
the
same
as
i
did
the
channel
here
was
straight
for
yards
without
a
boulder
in
it
but
the
stream
was
so
swift
that
it
caused
great
rolling
waves
in
the
center
of
a
kind
i
have
never
seen
anywhere
else
the
boys
were
not
skillful
enough
to
navigate
this
stream
and
the
suction
drew
them
to
the
center
where
the
great
waves
rolled
them
over
and
over
bottom
side
up
and
every
way
the
occupants
of
our
canoe
let
go
and
swam
to
shore
fields
had
always
been
afraid
of
water
and
had
worn
a
life
preserver
every
day
since
we
left
the
wagons
he
threw
up
his
hands
and
splashed
and
kicked
at
a
terrible
rate
for
he
could
not
swim
and
at
last
made
solid
ground
one
of
the
canoes
came
down
into
the
eddy
below
where
it
lodged
close
to
the
shore
bottom
up
alfred
walton
in
the
other
canoe
could
not
swim
but
held
on
to
the
gunwale
with
a
death
grip
and
it
went
on
down
through
the
rapids
sometimes
we
could
see
the
man
and
sometimes
not
and
he
and
the
canoe
took
turns
in
disappearing
walton
had
very
black
hair
and
as
he
clung
fast
to
his
canoe
his
black
head
looked
like
a
crow
on
the
end
of
a
log
sometimes
he
would
be
under
so
long
that
we
thought
he
must
be
lost
when
up
he
would
come
again
still
clinging
manfully
mcmahon
and
i
threw
everything
out
of
the
big
canoe
and
pushed
out
after
him
i
told
mc
to
kneel
down
so
i
could
see
over
him
to
keep
the
craft
off
the
rocks
and
by
changing
his
paddle
from
side
to
side
as
ordered
he
enabled
me
to
make
quick
moves
and
avoid
being
dashed
to
pieces
we
fairly
flew
the
boys
said
but
i
stood
up
in
the
stern
and
kept
it
clear
of
danger
till
we
ran
into
a
clear
piece
of
river
and
overtook
walton
clinging
to
the
overturned
boat
mcmahon
seized
the
boat
and
i
paddled
all
to
shore
but
walton
was
nearly
dead
and
could
hardly
keep
his
grasp
on
the
canoe
we
took
him
to
a
sandy
place
and
worked
over
him
and
warmed
him
in
the
sun
till
he
came
to
life
again
then
built
a
fire
and
laid
him
up
near
to
it
to
get
dry
and
warm
if
the
canoe
had
gone
on
yards
farther
with
him
before
we
caught
it
he
would
have
gone
into
another
long
rapid
and
been
drowned
we
left
walton
by
the
fire
and
crossing
the
river
in
the
slack
water
went
up
to
where
the
other
boys
were
standing
wet
and
all
was
gone
and
lost
rogers
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
three
half
dollars
and
said
sadly
boys
this
is
all
i
am
worth
in
the
world
all
the
clothes
he
had
were
a
pair
of
overalls
and
a
shirt
if
he
had
been
possessed
of
a
thousand
in
gold
he
would
have
been
no
richer
for
there
was
no
one
to
buy
from
and
nothing
to
buy
i
said
to
them
boys
we
ca
help
what
has
happened
we
do
the
best
we
can
right
your
canoe
get
the
water
out
and
we
go
down
and
see
how
walton
is
they
did
as
i
told
them
and
lo
and
behold
when
the
canoe
rolled
right
side
up
there
were
their
clothes
and
blankets
safe
and
sound
these
light
things
had
floated
in
the
canoe
and
were
safe
we
now
tried
by
joining
hands
to
reach
out
far
enough
to
recover
some
of
the
guns
but
by
feeling
with
their
feet
they
found
the
bottom
smooth
as
glass
and
the
property
all
swept
on
below
no
one
knew
where
the
current
was
so
powerful
that
no
one
could
stand
in
it
where
it
came
up
above
his
knees
the
eddy
which
enabled
us
to
save
the
first
canoe
with
the
bedding
and
clothes
was
caused
by
a
great
boulder
as
large
as
a
house
which
had
fallen
from
above
and
partly
blocked
the
stream
everything
that
would
sink
was
lost
we
all
got
into
the
two
canoes
and
went
down
to
walton
where
we
camped
and
staid
all
night
for
walton
benefit
while
we
were
waiting
i
took
my
gun
and
tried
to
climb
up
high
enough
to
see
how
much
longer
this
horrible
cañon
was
going
to
last
but
after
many
attempts
i
could
not
get
high
enough
to
see
in
any
direction
the
mountain
was
all
bare
rocks
in
terraces
but
it
was
impossible
to
climb
from
one
to
the
other
and
the
benches
were
all
filled
with
broken
rocks
that
had
fallen
from
above
by
the
time
i
got
back
to
camp
walton
was
dry
and
warm
and
could
talk
he
said
he
felt
better
and
pretty
good
over
his
rescue
when
he
was
going
under
the
water
it
seemed
sometimes
as
if
he
never
would
come
to
the
top
again
but
he
held
on
and
eventually
came
out
all
right
he
never
knew
how
he
got
to
shore
he
was
so
nearly
dead
when
rescued
the
next
morning
walton
was
so
well
we
started
on
we
were
now
very
poorly
armed
my
rifle
and
mcmahon
shotgun
were
all
the
arms
we
had
for
seven
of
us
and
we
could
make
but
a
poor
defence
if
attacked
by
man
or
beast
to
say
nothing
of
providing
ourselves
with
food
the
mountains
on
each
side
were
very
bare
of
timber
those
on
the
east
side
particularly
so
and
very
high
and
barren
toward
night
we
were
floating
along
in
a
piece
of
slack
water
the
river
below
made
a
short
turn
around
a
high
and
rocky
point
almost
perpendicular
from
the
water
there
was
a
terrace
along
the
side
of
this
point
about
fifty
feet
up
and
the
bench
grew
narrower
as
it
approached
the
river
as
i
was
coming
down
quite
close
under
this
bank
i
saw
three
mountain
sheep
on
the
bench
above
and
motioning
to
the
boys
i
ran
on
shore
and
with
my
gun
in
hand
crept
down
toward
them
keeping
a
small
pine
tree
between
myself
and
the
sheep
there
were
some
cedar
bushes
on
the
point
and
the
pines
grew
about
half
way
up
the
bank
i
got
in
as
good
a
range
as
possible
and
fired
at
one
of
them
which
staggered
around
and
fell
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
i
loaded
and
took
the
next
largest
one
which
came
down
the
same
way
the
third
one
tried
to
escape
by
going
down
the
bend
and
then
creeping
up
a
crevice
but
it
could
not
get
away
and
turned
back
cautiously
which
gave
me
time
to
load
again
and
put
a
ball
through
it
i
hit
it
a
little
too
far
back
for
instant
death
but
i
followed
it
up
and
found
it
down
and
helpless
and
soon
secured
it
i
hauled
this
one
down
the
mountain
and
the
other
boys
had
the
two
others
secure
by
this
time
mcmahon
was
so
elated
at
my
success
that
he
said
manley
if
i
could
shoot
as
you
do
i
would
never
want
any
better
business
and
the
other
fellows
said
they
guessed
we
were
having
better
luck
with
one
gun
than
with
six
so
we
had
a
merry
time
after
all
these
animals
were
of
a
bluish
color
with
hair
much
finer
than
deer
and
resembled
a
goat
more
than
a
sheep
these
three
were
all
females
and
their
horns
were
quite
straight
not
curved
like
the
big
males
we
cut
the
meat
from
the
bones
and
broke
them
up
making
a
fine
soup
which
tasted
pretty
good
they
were
in
pretty
good
order
and
the
meat
like
very
good
mutton
we
kept
pushing
on
down
the
river
the
rapids
were
still
dangerous
in
many
places
but
not
so
frequent
nor
so
bad
as
the
part
we
had
gone
over
and
we
could
see
that
the
river
gradually
grew
smoother
as
we
progressed
after
a
day
or
two
we
began
to
get
out
of
the
cañons
but
the
mountains
and
hills
on
each
side
were
barren
and
of
a
pale
yellow
caste
with
no
chance
for
us
to
climb
up
and
take
a
look
to
see
if
there
were
any
chances
for
us
further
along
we
had
now
been
obliged
to
follow
the
cañon
for
many
miles
for
the
only
way
to
get
out
was
to
get
out
endwise
climbing
the
banks
being
utterly
out
of
the
question
but
these
mountains
soon
came
to
an
end
and
there
was
some
cottonwood
and
willows
on
the
bank
of
the
river
which
was
now
so
smooth
we
could
ride
along
without
the
continual
loading
and
unloading
we
had
been
forced
to
practice
for
so
long
we
had
begun
to
get
a
little
desperate
at
the
lack
of
game
but
the
new
valley
which
grew
wider
all
the
time
gave
us
hope
again
if
it
was
quite
barren
everywhere
except
back
of
the
willow
trees
we
were
floating
along
very
silently
one
day
for
none
of
us
felt
very
much
in
the
mood
for
talking
when
we
heard
a
distant
sound
which
we
thought
was
very
much
like
the
firing
of
a
gun
we
kept
still
and
in
a
short
time
a
similar
sound
was
heard
plainer
and
evidently
some
ways
down
the
stream
again
and
again
we
heard
it
and
decided
that
it
must
be
a
gun
shot
and
yet
we
were
puzzled
to
know
how
it
could
be
we
were
pretty
sure
there
were
no
white
people
ahead
of
us
and
we
did
not
suppose
the
indians
in
this
land
had
any
firearms
it
might
be
barely
possible
that
we
were
coming
now
to
some
wagon
train
taking
a
southern
course
for
we
had
never
heard
that
there
were
any
settlements
in
this
direction
and
the
barren
country
would
preclude
any
such
thing
as
we
viewed
it
now
if
it
was
a
hostile
band
we
could
not
do
much
with
a
rifle
and
a
shot
gun
toward
defending
ourselves
or
taking
the
aggressive
some
of
the
boys
spoke
of
our
scalps
ornamenting
a
spear
handle
and
indulged
in
such
like
cheerful
talk
which
comforted
us
wonderfully
finally
we
concluded
we
did
not
come
out
into
that
wild
country
to
be
afraid
of
a
few
gunshots
and
determined
to
put
on
a
bold
front
fight
if
we
had
to
run
away
if
we
could
not
do
any
better
and
take
our
chances
on
getting
scalped
or
roasted
just
then
we
came
in
sight
of
three
indian
lodges
just
a
little
back
from
the
river
and
now
we
knew
for
certain
who
had
the
guns
mcmahon
and
i
were
in
the
lead
as
usual
and
it
was
only
a
moment
before
one
of
the
indians
appeared
gun
in
hand
and
made
motions
for
us
to
come
on
shore
a
cottonwood
tree
lay
nearly
across
the
river
and
i
had
gone
so
far
that
i
had
to
go
around
it
and
land
below
but
the
other
boys
behind
were
afraid
to
do
otherwise
than
to
land
right
there
as
the
indian
kept
his
gun
lying
across
his
arm
i
ran
our
canoe
below
to
a
patch
of
willows
where
we
landed
and
crawled
through
the
brush
till
we
came
in
sight
of
the
other
boys
where
we
stood
and
waited
a
moment
to
see
how
they
fared
and
whether
our
red
men
were
friends
or
enemies
there
were
no
suspicious
movements
on
their
part
so
we
came
out
and
walked
right
up
to
them
there
was
some
little
talk
but
i
am
sure
we
did
not
understand
one
another
language
and
so
we
made
motions
and
they
made
motions
and
we
got
along
better
we
went
with
them
down
to
the
tepee
and
there
we
heard
the
first
word
that
was
at
all
like
english
and
that
was
mormonee
with
a
sort
of
questioning
tone
pretty
soon
one
said
buffalo
and
then
we
concluded
they
were
on
a
big
hunt
of
some
sort
they
took
us
into
their
lodges
and
showed
us
blankets
knives
and
guns
and
then
with
a
suggestive
motion
said
all
was
mormonee
by
which
we
understood
they
had
got
them
from
the
mormons
the
indian
in
the
back
part
of
the
lodge
looked
very
pleasant
and
his
countenance
showed
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
for
a
man
of
the
mountains
i
now
told
the
boys
that
we
were
in
a
position
where
we
were
dependent
on
some
one
and
that
i
had
seen
enough
to
convince
me
that
these
indians
were
perfectly
friendly
with
the
mormons
and
that
for
our
own
benefit
we
had
better
pass
ourselves
off
for
mormons
also
so
we
put
our
right
hand
to
our
breast
and
said
mormonee
with
a
cheerful
countenance
and
that
act
conveyed
to
them
the
belief
that
we
were
chosen
disciples
of
the
great
and
only
brigham
and
we
became
friends
at
once
as
all
acknowledged
the
indian
who
sat
as
king
in
the
lodge
now
by
motions
and
a
word
or
two
made
himself
known
as
chief
walker
and
when
i
knew
this
i
took
great
pains
to
cultivate
his
acquaintance
i
was
quite
familiar
with
the
sign
language
used
by
all
the
indians
and
found
i
could
get
along
pretty
well
in
making
him
understand
and
knowing
what
he
said
i
asked
him
first
how
many
sleeps
or
days
it
was
from
there
to
mormonee
in
answer
he
put
out
his
left
hand
and
then
put
two
fingers
of
his
right
astride
of
it
making
both
go
up
and
down
with
the
same
motion
of
a
man
riding
a
horse
then
he
shut
his
eyes
and
laid
his
head
on
his
hand
three
times
by
which
i
understood
that
a
man
could
ride
to
the
mormon
settlement
in
three
sleeps
or
four
days
he
then
wanted
to
know
where
we
were
going
and
i
made
signs
that
we
were
wishing
to
go
toward
the
setting
sun
and
to
the
big
water
and
i
said
california
the
country
off
to
the
west
of
us
now
seemed
an
open
barren
plain
which
grew
wider
as
it
extended
west
the
mountains
on
the
north
side
seemed
to
get
lower
and
smaller
as
they
extended
west
but
on
the
south
or
east
side
they
were
all
high
and
rough
it
seemed
as
if
we
could
see
one
hundred
miles
down
the
river
and
up
to
the
time
we
met
the
indians
we
thought
we
had
got
through
all
our
troublesome
navigation
and
could
now
sail
on
quietly
and
safely
to
the
great
pacific
ocean
and
land
of
gold
when
i
told
chief
walker
this
he
seemed
very
much
astonished
as
if
wondering
why
we
were
going
down
the
river
when
we
wanted
to
get
west
across
the
country
i
asked
him
how
many
sleeps
it
was
to
the
big
water
and
he
shook
his
head
pointed
out
across
the
country
and
then
to
the
river
and
shook
his
head
again
by
which
i
understood
that
water
was
scarce
out
the
way
he
pointed
he
then
led
me
down
to
a
smooth
sand
bar
on
the
river
and
then
with
a
crooked
stick
began
to
make
a
map
in
the
sand
first
he
made
a
long
crooked
mark
ten
feet
long
or
so
and
pointing
to
the
river
to
let
me
know
that
the
mark
in
the
sand
was
made
to
represent
it
he
then
made
a
straight
mark
across
near
the
north
end
of
the
stream
and
showed
the
other
streams
which
came
into
the
green
river
which
i
saw
at
once
was
exactly
correct
then
he
laid
some
small
stones
on
each
side
of
the
cross
mark
and
making
a
small
hoop
of
a
willow
twig
he
rolled
it
in
the
mark
he
had
made
across
the
river
then
flourished
his
stick
as
if
he
were
driving
oxen
thus
he
represented
the
emigrant
road
he
traced
the
branches
off
to
the
north
where
the
soldiers
had
gone
and
the
road
to
california
which
the
emigrants
took
all
of
which
we
could
see
was
correct
then
he
began
to
describe
the
river
down
which
we
had
come
a
short
distance
below
the
road
he
put
some
small
stones
on
each
side
of
the
river
to
represent
mountains
he
then
put
down
his
hands
one
on
each
side
of
the
crooked
mark
and
then
raised
them
up
again
saying
as
he
raised
them
to
say
that
the
mountains
there
were
very
high
then
he
traced
down
the
stream
to
a
place
below
where
we
made
our
canoes
when
he
placed
the
stone
back
from
the
river
farther
to
show
that
there
was
a
valley
there
then
he
drew
them
in
close
again
farther
down
and
piled
them
up
again
two
or
three
tiers
high
then
placing
both
fists
on
them
he
raised
them
higher
than
the
top
of
his
head
saying
and
looking
still
higher
and
shaking
his
head
as
if
to
say
awful
bad
cañon
and
thus
he
went
on
describing
the
river
till
we
understood
that
we
were
near
the
place
where
we
now
were
and
then
pointed
to
his
tepee
showing
that
i
understood
him
all
right
it
was
all
correct
as
i
very
well
knew
and
assured
me
that
he
knew
all
about
the
country
i
became
much
interested
in
my
new
found
friend
and
had
him
continue
his
map
down
the
river
he
showed
two
streams
coming
in
on
the
east
side
and
then
he
began
piling
up
stones
on
each
side
of
the
river
and
then
got
longer
ones
and
piled
them
higher
and
higher
yet
then
he
stood
with
one
foot
on
each
side
of
his
river
and
put
his
hands
on
the
stones
and
then
raised
them
as
high
as
he
could
making
a
continued
as
long
as
his
breath
would
last
pointed
to
the
canoe
and
made
signs
with
his
hands
how
it
would
roll
and
pitch
in
the
rapids
and
finely
capsize
and
throw
us
all
out
he
then
made
signs
of
death
to
show
us
that
it
was
a
fatal
place
i
understood
perfectly
plain
from
this
that
below
the
valley
where
we
now
were
was
a
terrible
cañon
much
higher
than
any
we
had
passed
and
the
rapids
were
not
navigable
with
safety
then
walker
shook
his
head
more
than
once
and
looked
very
sober
and
said
indiano
and
reaching
for
his
bow
and
arrows
he
drew
the
bow
back
to
its
utmost
length
and
put
the
arrow
close
to
my
breast
showing
how
i
would
get
shot
then
he
would
draw
his
hand
across
his
throat
and
shut
his
eyes
as
if
in
death
to
make
us
understand
that
this
was
a
hostile
country
before
us
as
well
as
rough
and
dangerous
i
now
had
a
description
of
the
country
ahead
and
believed
it
to
be
reliable
as
soon
as
i
could
conveniently
after
this
i
had
a
council
with
the
boys
who
had
looked
on
in
silence
while
i
was
holding
the
silent
confab
with
the
chief
i
told
them
where
we
were
and
what
chances
there
were
of
getting
to
california
by
this
route
and
that
for
my
part
i
had
as
soon
be
killed
by
mormans
as
by
savage
indians
and
that
i
believed
the
best
way
for
us
to
do
was
to
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
salt
lake
now
i
said
those
of
you
who
agree
with
me
can
follow
and
i
hope
all
will
mcmahon
said
that
we
could
not
understand
a
word
the
old
indian
said
and
as
to
following
his
trails
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
and
it
do
seem
right
he
said
he
had
a
map
of
the
country
and
it
looked
just
as
safe
to
him
to
go
on
down
the
river
as
to
go
wandering
across
a
dry
and
desolate
country
which
we
knew
nothing
of
i
said
to
mcmahon
i
know
this
sign
language
pretty
well
it
is
used
by
almost
all
the
indians
and
is
just
as
plain
and
certain
to
me
as
my
talk
is
to
you
chief
walker
and
his
forefathers
were
borne
here
and
know
the
country
as
well
as
you
know
your
father
farm
and
for
my
part
i
think
i
shall
take
one
of
his
trails
and
go
to
salt
lake
and
take
the
chances
that
way
i
have
no
objections
to
you
going
some
other
way
if
you
wish
to
and
think
it
is
best
mcmahon
and
fields
concluded
they
would
not
follow
me
any
farther
i
then
went
to
chief
walker
and
had
him
point
out
the
trail
to
mormonie
as
well
as
he
could
he
told
me
where
to
enter
the
mountains
leading
north
and
when
we
got
part
way
he
told
me
we
would
come
to
an
indian
camp
when
i
must
follow
some
horse
tracks
newly
made
he
made
me
know
this
by
using
his
hands
like
horse
forefeet
and
pointed
the
way
some
of
the
young
men
motioned
for
me
to
come
out
and
shoot
at
a
mark
with
them
and
as
i
saw
it
would
please
them
i
did
so
and
took
good
care
to
beat
them
every
time
too
then
they
wanted
to
swap
narawaup
guns
with
me
which
i
declined
doing
after
this
the
chief
came
to
me
and
wanted
me
to
go
and
hunt
buffalo
with
them
i
told
him
i
had
no
horse
and
then
he
went
and
had
a
nice
gray
one
brought
up
and
told
me
i
could
ride
him
if
i
would
go
he
took
his
bow
and
arrow
and
showed
me
how
he
could
shoot
an
arrow
straight
through
a
buffalo
just
back
of
his
short
ribs
and
that
the
arrow
would
go
clear
through
and
come
out
on
the
other
side
without
touching
a
bone
those
fellows
were
in
fine
spirit
on
a
big
hunt
and
when
walker
pointed
out
his
route
to
me
he
swung
his
hand
around
to
salt
lake
they
all
spoke
the
word
buffalo
quite
plainly
i
took
his
strong
bow
and
found
i
could
hardly
pull
it
half
way
out
but
i
have
no
doubt
he
could
do
as
he
said
he
could
i
hardly
knew
how
to
refuse
going
with
him
i
asked
him
how
long
it
would
be
before
he
would
get
around
his
long
circuit
and
get
to
salt
lake
to
which
he
replied
by
pulverizing
some
leaves
in
his
hands
and
scattering
them
in
the
air
to
represent
snow
which
would
fall
by
the
time
he
got
to
mormonee
i
shivered
as
he
said
this
and
by
his
actions
i
saw
that
i
understood
him
right
i
told
him
i
could
not
go
with
him
for
the
other
boys
would
depend
on
me
to
get
them
something
to
eat
and
i
put
my
finger
into
my
open
mouth
to
tell
him
this
i
think
if
i
had
been
alone
i
should
have
accepted
his
offer
and
should
have
had
a
good
time
i
gave
them
to
understand
that
we
would
swap
narawaup
with
them
for
some
horses
so
he
brought
up
a
pair
of
nice
two
colts
for
us
i
offered
him
some
money
for
them
he
did
not
want
that
but
would
take
clothing
of
almost
any
kind
we
let
them
have
some
that
we
could
get
along
without
and
some
one
let
walker
have
a
coat
he
put
it
on
and
being
more
warmly
dressed
than
ever
before
the
sweat
ran
down
his
face
in
streams
we
let
them
have
some
needles
and
thread
and
some
odd
notions
we
had
to
spare
we
saw
that
walker
had
some
three
or
four
head
of
cattle
with
him
which
he
could
kill
if
they
did
not
secure
game
at
the
time
they
expected
mcmahon
and
field
still
persisted
they
would
not
go
with
us
and
so
we
divided
our
little
stock
of
flour
and
dried
meat
with
them
as
fairly
as
possible
and
decided
we
would
try
the
trail
when
our
plans
were
settled
we
felt
in
pretty
good
spirits
again
and
one
of
the
boys
got
up
a
sort
of
fiddle
which
made
a
squeaking
noise
and
in
a
little
while
there
was
a
sort
of
mixed
american
and
indian
dance
going
on
in
which
the
squaws
joined
in
and
we
had
a
pretty
jolly
time
till
quite
late
at
night
we
were
well
pleased
that
these
wild
folks
had
proved
themselves
to
be
true
friends
to
us
the
morning
we
were
to
start
i
told
the
boys
a
dream
i
had
in
which
i
had
seen
that
the
course
we
had
decided
on
was
the
correct
one
but
mcmahon
and
field
thought
we
were
foolish
and
said
they
had
rather
take
the
chances
of
going
with
the
indians
or
going
on
down
the
river
he
seemed
to
place
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
he
could
not
understand
the
indians
said
he
this
indian
may
be
all
right
and
maybe
he
will
lead
us
all
into
a
dreadful
trap
they
are
treacherous
and
revengeful
and
for
some
merely
fancied
wrong
done
by
us
or
by
some
one
else
of
whom
we
have
no
control
or
knowledge
they
may
take
our
scalps
wipe
us
out
of
existence
and
no
one
will
ever
know
what
became
of
us
now
this
map
of
mine
show
any
bad
places
on
this
river
and
i
believe
we
can
get
down
easily
enough
and
get
to
california
some
time
field
and
i
can
not
make
up
our
minds
so
easily
as
you
fellows
i
believe
your
chances
are
very
poor
the
boys
now
had
our
few
things
loaded
on
the
two
colts
for
they
had
fully
decided
to
go
with
me
and
i
was
not
in
the
least
put
back
by
mcmahon
dire
forebodings
we
shook
hands
with
quivering
lips
as
we
each
hoped
the
other
would
meet
good
luck
and
find
enough
to
eat
and
all
such
sort
of
friendly
talk
and
then
with
my
little
party
on
the
one
side
and
mcmahon
and
field
whom
we
were
to
leave
behind
on
the
other
we
bowed
to
each
other
with
bared
heads
and
then
we
started
out
of
the
little
young
cottonwoods
into
the
broad
plain
that
seemed
to
get
wider
and
wider
as
we
went
west
the
mountains
on
the
northern
side
grew
smaller
and
less
steep
as
we
went
west
and
on
the
other
hand
reached
down
the
river
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
plain
itself
was
black
and
barren
and
for
a
hundred
miles
at
least
ahead
of
us
it
seemed
to
have
no
end
walker
had
explained
to
us
that
we
must
follow
some
horse
tracks
and
enter
a
cañon
some
miles
to
the
northwest
he
had
made
his
hands
work
like
horses
feet
placing
then
near
the
ground
as
if
following
a
trail
we
were
not
much
more
than
a
mile
away
when
on
looking
back
we
saw
chief
walker
coming
towards
us
on
a
horse
at
full
speed
and
motioning
for
us
to
stop
this
we
did
though
some
of
the
boys
said
we
would
surely
be
marched
back
and
scalped
but
it
was
not
for
that
he
came
he
had
been
watching
us
and
saw
that
we
had
failed
to
notice
the
tracks
of
the
horses
he
told
us
about
so
he
rode
after
us
and
now
took
us
off
some
little
distance
to
the
right
got
off
his
horse
and
showed
us
the
faint
horse
tracks
which
we
were
to
follow
and
said
mormonie
he
pointed
out
to
us
the
exact
cañon
we
were
to
enter
when
we
reached
the
hills
and
said
after
three
sleeps
we
would
find
an
indian
camp
on
top
of
the
mountain
he
then
bade
us
good
bye
again
and
galloped
back
to
his
own
camp
we
now
resumed
our
journey
keeping
watch
of
the
tracks
more
closely
and
as
we
came
near
the
spurs
of
the
mountain
which
projected
out
into
the
barren
valley
we
crossed
several
well
marked
trails
running
along
the
foot
hills
at
right
angles
to
our
own
this
we
afterwards
learned
was
the
regular
trail
from
santa
fé
to
los
angeles
at
some
big
rocks
further
on
we
camped
for
the
night
and
found
water
in
some
pools
or
holes
in
the
flat
rocks
which
held
the
rain
reading
people
of
who
know
so
well
the
geography
of
the
american
continent
may
need
to
stop
and
think
that
in
the
whole
region
west
of
the
missouri
river
was
very
little
known
the
only
men
venturesome
enough
to
dare
to
travel
over
it
were
hunters
and
trappers
who
by
a
wild
life
had
been
used
to
all
the
privations
of
such
a
journey
and
shrewd
as
the
indians
themselves
in
the
mysterious
ways
of
the
trail
and
the
chase
even
these
fellows
had
only
investigated
certain
portions
best
suited
to
their
purpose
the
indians
here
have
the
reputation
of
being
blood
thirsty
savages
who
took
delight
in
murder
and
torture
but
here
in
the
very
midst
of
this
wild
and
desolate
country
we
found
a
chief
and
his
tribe
walker
and
his
followers
who
were
as
humane
and
kind
to
white
people
as
could
be
expected
of
any
one
i
have
often
wondered
at
the
knowledge
of
this
man
respecting
the
country
of
which
he
was
able
to
make
us
a
good
map
in
the
sand
point
out
to
us
the
impassable
cañon
locate
the
hostile
indians
and
many
points
which
were
not
accurately
known
by
our
own
explorers
for
many
years
afterward
he
undoubtedly
saved
our
little
band
from
a
watery
grave
for
without
his
advice
we
had
gone
on
and
on
far
into
the
great
colorado
cañon
from
which
escape
would
have
been
impossible
and
securing
food
another
impossibility
while
destruction
by
hostile
indians
was
among
the
strong
probabilities
of
the
case
so
in
a
threefold
way
i
have
for
these
more
than
forty
years
credited
the
lives
of
myself
and
comrades
to
the
thoughtful
interest
and
humane
consideration
of
old
chief
walker
in
another
pool
or
pond
near
the
one
where
we
were
camped
i
shot
a
small
duck
big
sage
was
plenty
here
for
fuel
and
we
had
duck
for
supper
our
party
consisted
of
five
men
and
two
small
ponies
only
two
years
old
with
a
stock
of
provisions
very
small
including
that
the
old
chief
had
given
us
we
started
on
in
the
morning
following
our
faint
trail
till
we
came
to
the
cañon
we
had
in
view
and
up
this
we
turned
as
we
had
been
directed
finding
in
the
bottom
a
little
running
stream
timber
began
to
appear
as
we
ascended
and
grass
also
there
were
signs
of
deer
and
grouse
but
we
had
no
time
to
stop
to
hunt
for
i
had
the
only
gun
and
while
i
hunted
the
others
must
lie
idly
by
we
reached
the
summit
at
a
low
pass
and
just
above
on
the
north
side
of
the
higher
mountains
were
considerable
banks
of
snow
following
the
chief
instructions
we
left
the
trail
and
followed
some
horse
tracks
over
rolling
hills
high
on
the
mountain
side
we
found
the
indian
camp
exactly
as
the
chief
had
described
consisting
of
two
or
three
lodges
the
men
were
all
absent
hunting
but
the
women
were
gathering
and
baking
some
sort
of
a
root
which
looked
like
a
carrot
they
made
a
pile
of
several
bushels
and
covered
it
with
earth
then
made
a
fire
treating
the
pile
some
as
a
charcoal
burner
does
his
pit
of
coal
when
sufficiently
cooked
they
beat
them
up
and
made
the
material
into
small
cakes
which
were
dried
in
the
sun
the
dried
cakes
were
as
black
as
coal
and
intended
for
winter
use
these
roots
before
roasting
were
unfit
for
food
as
they
contained
a
sort
of
acrid
juice
that
would
make
the
tongue
smart
and
very
sore
but
there
was
a
very
good
rich
taste
when
cooked
the
woman
pointed
to
our
horses
and
said
walker
so
we
knew
they
were
aware
that
we
got
them
of
him
and
might
have
taken
us
for
horse
thieves
for
aught
i
know
as
it
was
not
yet
night
when
we
came
to
the
camp
we
passed
on
and
camped
on
a
clear
mountain
brook
where
grew
some
pine
trees
after
a
little
some
of
the
indians
belonging
to
the
camp
we
had
passed
came
in
bringing
some
venison
for
which
we
traded
by
giving
them
some
needles
and
a
few
other
trinkets
i
beat
these
fellows
shooting
at
a
mark
and
then
they
wanted
to
trade
guns
which
i
declined
this
piece
of
meat
helped
us
along
considerably
with
our
provisions
for
game
was
very
scarce
and
only
some
sage
hens
had
come
across
our
trail
one
day
i
scared
a
hawk
off
the
ground
and
we
took
the
sage
hen
he
had
caught
and
was
eating
and
made
some
soup
of
it
after
being
on
this
trail
six
or
seven
days
we
began
to
think
of
killing
one
of
our
colts
for
food
for
we
had
put
ourselves
on
two
meals
a
day
and
the
work
was
very
hard
so
that
hunger
was
all
the
time
increasing
we
thought
this
was
a
pretty
long
road
for
walker
to
ride
over
in
three
sleeps
as
he
said
he
could
and
we
began
also
to
think
there
might
be
some
mistake
somewhere
although
it
had
otherwise
turned
out
just
as
he
said
on
the
eighth
day
our
came
out
into
a
large
trail
which
was
on
a
down
grade
leading
in
a
northward
direction
on
the
ninth
day
we
came
into
a
large
valley
and
near
night
came
in
sight
of
a
few
covered
wagons
a
part
of
a
train
that
intended
going
on
a
little
later
over
the
southern
route
to
los
angeles
but
were
waiting
for
the
weather
to
get
a
little
cooler
for
a
large
part
of
the
route
was
over
almost
barren
deserts
we
were
very
glad
to
find
these
wagons
for
they
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
food
and
the
bountiful
supper
they
treated
us
to
was
the
very
thing
we
needed
we
camped
here
and
told
them
of
the
hardships
we
had
passed
through
they
had
hired
a
guide
each
wagon
paying
him
ten
dollars
for
his
service
our
little
party
talked
over
the
situation
among
ourselves
and
concluded
that
as
we
were
good
walkers
we
must
allow
ourselves
to
be
used
in
any
way
so
that
we
had
grub
and
concluded
as
many
of
us
as
possible
would
try
to
get
some
service
to
do
for
our
board
and
walk
along
with
the
party
john
rogers
had
a
dollar
and
a
half
and
i
had
thirty
dollars
which
was
all
the
money
we
had
in
our
camp
we
found
out
we
were
about
miles
south
of
salt
lake
city
some
of
the
boys
next
day
arranged
to
work
for
their
board
and
the
others
would
be
taken
along
if
they
would
furnish
themselves
with
flour
and
bacon
this
part
of
the
proposition
fell
to
me
and
two
others
and
so
hazelrig
and
i
took
the
two
colts
and
started
for
the
city
where
they
told
us
we
could
get
all
we
needed
with
our
little
purse
of
money
we
reached
hobble
creek
before
night
near
salt
lake
where
there
was
a
mormon
fort
and
were
also
a
number
of
wagons
belonging
to
some
prospecting
train
there
seemed
to
be
no
men
about
and
we
were
looking
about
among
the
wagons
for
some
one
to
inquire
of
when
a
woman
came
to
the
front
of
the
last
wagon
and
looked
out
at
us
and
to
my
surprise
it
was
bennett
wife
of
the
man
i
had
been
trying
to
overtake
ever
since
my
start
on
this
long
trip
bennett
had
my
entire
outfit
with
him
on
this
trip
and
was
all
the
time
wondering
whether
i
would
ever
catch
up
with
them
we
stayed
till
the
men
came
in
with
their
cattle
towards
night
and
bennett
was
glad
enough
to
see
me
i
assure
you
we
had
a
good
substantial
supper
and
then
sat
around
the
campfire
nearly
all
night
telling
of
our
experience
since
leaving
wisconsin
i
had
missed
bennett
at
the
missouri
river
i
knew
of
no
place
where
people
crossed
the
river
except
council
bluff
here
i
had
searched
faithfully
finding
no
trace
of
him
but
it
seems
they
had
crossed
farther
up
at
a
place
called
kanesville
a
mormon
crossing
and
followed
up
the
platte
river
on
the
north
side
their
only
bad
luck
had
been
to
lose
a
fine
black
horse
which
was
staked
out
and
when
a
herd
of
buffaloes
came
along
he
broke
his
rope
and
followed
after
them
he
was
looked
for
with
other
horses
but
never
found
and
doubtless
became
a
prize
for
some
enterprising
mr
lo
who
was
fortunate
enough
to
capture
him
hazelrig
and
i
told
of
our
experience
on
the
south
side
of
the
platte
why
we
went
down
green
river
what
a
rough
time
we
had
how
we
were
stopped
by
the
indians
and
how
we
had
come
across
from
the
river
arriving
the
day
before
and
were
now
on
our
way
to
salt
lake
to
get
some
flour
and
bacon
so
we
could
go
on
with
the
train
when
it
started
as
they
had
offered
to
haul
our
grub
for
our
service
if
we
could
carry
ourselves
on
foot
bennett
would
not
hear
of
my
going
on
to
salt
lake
city
for
he
said
there
must
be
provisions
enough
in
the
party
and
in
the
morning
we
were
able
to
buy
flour
and
bacon
of
john
philips
of
mineral
point
and
of
wm
philips
his
brother
i
think
we
got
a
hundred
pounds
of
flour
and
a
quantity
of
bacon
and
some
other
things
i
had
some
money
which
i
had
received
for
my
horse
sold
to
dallas
but
as
the
others
had
none
i
paid
for
it
all
and
told
hazelrig
to
take
the
ponies
and
go
back
to
camp
with
a
share
of
the
provisions
and
do
the
best
he
could
i
had
now
my
own
gun
and
ammunition
with
some
clothing
and
other
items
which
i
had
prepared
in
wisconsin
before
i
started
after
my
winnebago
pony
and
i
felt
i
ought
to
share
the
money
i
had
with
the
other
boys
to
help
them
as
best
i
could
i
felt
that
i
was
pretty
well
fixed
and
had
nothing
to
fear
bennett
told
me
much
of
the
trip
on
the
north
side
of
the
platte
he
said
they
had
some
cholera
of
which
a
few
people
died
and
related
how
the
outer
if
not
the
inner
nature
of
the
men
changed
as
they
left
civilization
law
and
the
courts
behind
them
some
who
had
been
raised
together
and
lived
together
all
their
lives
without
discord
or
trouble
who
were
considered
model
men
at
home
and
just
the
right
people
to
be
connected
with
in
such
an
expedition
seemed
to
change
their
character
entirely
out
on
these
wild
wastes
when
anything
excited
their
displeasure
their
blood
boiled
over
and
only
the
interference
of
older
and
wiser
heads
on
many
occasions
prevented
bloodshed
some
dissolved
the
solemn
contract
they
had
made
to
travel
together
systematically
and
in
order
and
to
stand
by
even
unto
death
and
when
they
reached
the
upper
platte
the
journey
only
half
over
talked
of
going
back
or
splitting
up
the
outfit
and
join
others
they
had
taken
a
fancy
to
some
who
could
not
agree
upon
a
just
division
of
a
joint
outfit
thinking
one
party
was
trying
to
cheat
would
not
yield
but
would
cut
their
wagons
in
two
lengthwise
just
for
spite
so
that
no
carts
could
be
made
and
the
whole
vehicle
spoiled
for
both
parties
the
ugly
disagreements
were
many
and
the
cloven
foot
was
shown
in
many
ways
guns
were
often
drawn
and
pointed
but
some
one
would
generally
interfere
and
prevent
bloodshed
others
were
honest
and
law
abiding
to
the
last
degree
beyond
law
and
churches
and
would
act
as
harmoniously
as
at
home
obeying
their
chosen
captain
in
the
smallest
particular
without
any
grumbling
or
dissension
doing
to
every
one
as
they
would
be
done
by
these
were
the
pride
of
the
train
the
trains
were
most
of
them
organized
and
all
along
the
river
bottom
one
was
hardly
ever
out
of
sight
of
some
of
the
wagons
all
going
west
buffalo
and
antelope
were
plenty
and
in
great
droves
followed
always
by
wolves
great
and
small
who
were
on
the
lookout
for
crippled
or
dead
animals
with
which
to
fill
their
hungry
stomachs
buffalo
meat
was
plenty
and
much
enjoyed
while
passing
this
section
of
the
road
and
this
opportunity
of
replenishing
enabled
the
stock
to
last
them
over
more
desolate
regions
where
game
was
scarce
after
bennett
had
told
his
stories
and
i
had
related
more
of
our
own
close
escapes
i
began
to
ask
him
why
he
went
this
way
which
seemed
to
be
very
circuitous
and
much
longer
than
the
way
they
had
first
intended
to
go
he
said
that
it
was
too
late
in
the
season
to
go
the
safely
for
there
was
yet
miles
of
bad
country
to
cross
and
do
the
best
they
could
it
would
be
at
the
commencement
of
the
rainy
season
before
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
could
be
reached
and
in
those
mountains
there
was
often
a
snow
fall
of
feet
or
more
and
anyone
caught
in
it
would
surely
perish
if
they
tried
to
winter
at
the
base
of
the
mountains
it
was
a
long
way
to
get
provisions
and
no
assurance
of
wild
game
and
this
course
was
considered
very
hazardous
for
any
one
to
undertake
this
they
had
learned
after
consulting
mountaineers
and
others
who
knew
about
the
regions
and
as
there
was
nothing
doing
among
the
latter
day
saints
to
give
employment
to
any
one
it
was
decided
best
to
keep
moving
and
go
the
southern
route
by
way
of
los
angeles
no
wagons
were
reported
as
ever
getting
through
that
way
but
a
trail
had
been
traveled
through
that
barren
desert
country
for
perhaps
a
hundred
years
and
the
same
could
be
easily
broadened
into
a
wagon
road
after
days
of
argument
and
talks
this
southern
route
was
agreed
upon
and
capt
hunt
was
chosen
as
guide
capt
hunt
was
a
mormon
and
had
more
than
one
wife
but
he
had
convinced
them
that
he
knew
something
about
the
road
each
agreed
to
give
him
ten
dollars
to
pilot
the
train
to
san
bernardino
where
the
mormon
church
had
bought
a
spanish
grant
of
land
and
no
doubt
they
thought
a
wagon
road
to
that
place
would
benefit
them
greatly
and
probably
gave
much
encouragement
for
the
parties
to
travel
this
way
it
was
undoubtedly
safer
than
the
northern
mountain
route
at
this
season
of
the
year
it
seemed
at
least
to
be
a
new
venture
for
emigrant
trains
at
least
as
to
ultimate
success
for
we
had
no
knowledge
of
any
that
had
gone
through
safely
some
western
people
remembered
the
history
of
the
mormons
in
illinois
and
missouri
and
their
doings
there
feared
somewhat
for
their
own
safety
now
that
they
were
so
completely
under
their
power
for
they
knew
the
mormons
to
be
revengeful
and
it
was
considered
very
unsafe
for
any
traveler
to
acknowledge
he
was
from
missouri
many
a
one
who
had
been
born
there
and
lived
there
all
his
life
would
promptly
claim
some
other
state
as
his
native
place
i
heard
one
mormon
say
that
there
were
some
missourians
on
the
plains
that
would
never
reach
california
they
used
us
bad
said
he
and
his
face
took
on
a
really
murderous
look
these
mormons
at
salt
lake
were
situated
as
if
on
an
island
in
the
sea
and
no
enemy
could
reach
any
adjoining
state
or
territory
if
brigham
young
band
of
destroying
angels
were
only
warned
to
look
after
them
at
a
late
hour
that
night
we
lay
down
to
sleep
and
morning
came
clear
and
bright
after
breakfast
bennett
said
to
me
now
lewis
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
i
have
two
wagons
and
two
drivers
and
four
yoke
of
good
oxen
and
plenty
of
provisions
i
have
your
outfit
yet
your
gun
and
ammunition
and
your
two
good
hickory
shirts
which
are
just
in
time
for
your
present
needs
you
need
not
do
any
work
you
just
look
around
and
kill
what
game
you
can
for
us
and
this
will
help
as
much
as
anything
you
can
do
i
was
of
course
glad
to
accept
this
offer
and
thanks
to
bennett
kind
care
of
my
outfit
was
better
fixed
then
any
of
the
other
boys
we
inquired
around
among
the
other
wagons
as
to
their
supply
of
flour
and
bacon
and
succeeded
to
getting
flour
from
philips
and
bacon
from
some
of
the
others
as
much
as
we
supposed
the
other
boys
would
need
which
i
paid
for
and
when
this
was
loaded
on
the
two
colts
hazelrig
started
back
alone
to
the
boys
in
camp
as
i
was
so
well
provided
for
i
gave
him
all
my
money
for
they
might
need
some
and
i
did
not
the
wagons
which
composed
the
intended
train
were
very
much
scattered
about
having
moved
out
from
salt
lake
at
pleasure
and
it
was
said
to
be
too
early
to
make
the
start
on
the
southern
route
for
the
weather
on
the
hot
barren
desert
was
said
to
grow
cooler
a
little
later
in
the
season
and
it
was
only
at
this
cool
season
that
the
south
west
part
of
the
desert
could
be
crossed
in
safety
the
scattering
members
of
the
train
began
to
congregate
and
capt
hunt
said
it
was
necessary
to
have
some
sort
of
system
about
the
move
and
that
before
they
moved
they
must
organize
and
adopt
rules
and
laws
which
must
be
obeyed
he
said
they
must
move
like
an
army
and
that
he
was
to
be
a
dictator
in
all
things
except
that
in
case
of
necessity
a
majority
of
the
train
could
rule
otherwise
it
was
thought
best
to
get
together
and
try
a
march
out
one
day
then
go
in
camp
and
organize
this
they
did
and
at
the
camp
there
was
gathered
one
hundred
and
seven
wagons
a
big
drove
of
horses
and
cattle
perhaps
five
hundred
in
all
the
train
was
divided
into
seven
divisions
and
each
division
was
to
elect
its
own
captain
division
no
should
lead
the
march
the
first
day
and
their
men
should
take
charge
of
the
stock
and
deliver
them
to
the
wagons
in
the
morning
and
then
no
should
take
the
rear
with
no
in
the
lead
to
break
the
road
the
rear
division
would
not
turn
a
wheel
before
the
next
day
and
it
would
be
about
that
time
at
night
before
they
were
in
camp
and
unyoked
the
numbers
of
animals
cleaned
out
the
feed
for
a
mile
or
two
each
side
of
the
camp
and
a
general
meeting
was
called
for
the
organization
of
the
whole
granger
got
up
so
he
could
look
over
the
audience
and
proceeded
to
explain
the
plan
and
to
read
a
preamble
and
resolutions
which
had
been
prepared
as
the
basis
for
government
i
remember
that
it
begun
thus
this
organization
shall
be
known
and
designated
as
the
sand
walking
company
and
shall
consist
of
seven
divisions
etc
detailing
the
manner
of
marching
as
we
have
recited
capt
j
hunt
was
chosen
commander
and
guide
and
his
orders
must
be
obeyed
all
possible
trouble
that
we
could
imagine
might
come
was
provided
against
in
our
written
agreement
and
all
promised
to
live
up
to
it
chapter
ix
we
moved
off
in
good
style
from
this
camp
after
a
day
or
two
and
before
we
reached
what
is
called
little
salt
lake
an
attempt
was
made
to
make
a
short
cut
to
save
distance
the
train
only
went
on
this
cut
off
a
day
or
two
when
capt
hunt
came
back
from
the
front
and
said
they
had
better
turn
back
to
the
old
trail
again
which
all
did
this
was
a
bad
move
the
train
much
broken
and
not
easy
to
get
them
into
regular
working
order
again
we
were
now
approaching
what
they
called
the
rim
of
the
basin
within
the
basin
the
water
all
ran
to
the
north
or
toward
great
salt
lake
but
when
we
crossed
the
rim
all
was
toward
the
colorado
river
through
which
it
reached
the
pacific
ocean
about
this
time
we
were
overtaken
by
another
train
commanded
by
capt
smith
they
had
a
map
with
them
made
by
one
williams
of
salt
lake
a
mountaineer
who
was
represented
to
know
all
the
routes
through
all
the
mountains
of
utah
and
this
map
showed
a
way
to
turn
off
from
the
southern
route
not
far
from
the
divide
which
separated
the
waters
of
the
basin
from
those
which
flowed
toward
the
colorado
and
pass
over
the
mountains
coming
out
in
what
they
called
tulare
valley
much
nearer
than
by
los
angeles
this
map
was
quite
frequently
exhibited
and
the
matter
freely
discussed
in
camp
indeed
speeches
were
made
in
the
interest
of
the
route
which
was
to
be
so
much
shorter
a
clergyman
the
rev
brier
was
very
enthusiastic
about
this
matter
and
discoursed
learnedly
and
plausibly
about
it
the
more
the
matter
was
talked
about
the
more
there
were
who
were
converted
to
the
belief
that
the
short
road
would
be
the
best
the
map
showed
every
camp
on
the
road
and
showed
where
there
was
water
and
grass
and
as
to
obstacles
to
the
wagons
it
was
thought
they
could
easily
be
overcome
a
general
meeting
was
called
for
better
consideration
of
the
question
capt
hunt
said
you
all
know
i
was
hired
to
go
by
way
of
los
angeles
but
if
you
all
wish
to
go
and
follow
smith
i
will
go
also
but
if
even
one
wagon
decides
to
go
the
original
route
i
shall
feel
bound
to
go
with
that
wagon
a
great
many
were
anxious
to
get
the
opinion
of
capt
hunt
on
the
feasibility
of
the
new
route
for
he
was
a
mountain
man
and
could
probably
give
us
some
good
advice
he
finally
consented
to
talk
of
it
and
said
he
really
knew
no
more
then
the
others
about
this
particular
route
but
he
very
much
doubted
if
a
white
man
ever
went
over
it
and
that
he
did
not
consider
it
at
all
safe
for
those
who
had
wives
and
children
in
their
company
to
take
the
unknown
road
young
men
who
had
no
family
could
possibly
get
through
and
save
time
even
if
the
road
was
not
as
good
as
los
angeles
road
but
said
he
if
you
decide
to
follow
smith
i
will
go
will
go
with
you
even
if
the
road
leads
to
hell
on
the
route
from
near
salt
lake
to
this
point
we
found
the
country
to
grow
more
barren
as
we
progressed
the
grass
was
thinner
and
sage
brush
took
the
place
of
timber
our
road
took
us
in
sight
of
sevier
lake
and
also
while
going
through
the
low
hills
passed
little
salt
lake
which
was
almost
dry
with
a
beach
around
it
almost
as
white
as
snow
it
might
have
had
a
little
more
the
dignity
of
a
lake
in
wet
weather
but
it
was
a
rather
dry
affair
as
we
saw
it
at
one
point
on
this
route
we
came
into
a
long
narrow
valley
well
covered
with
sage
brush
and
before
we
had
gone
very
far
we
discovered
that
this
was
a
great
place
for
long
eared
rabbits
we
would
call
them
jack
rabbits
now
every
one
who
had
a
gun
put
it
into
service
on
this
occasion
and
there
was
much
popping
and
shooting
on
every
side
great
clouds
of
smoke
rolled
up
as
the
hunters
advanced
and
the
rabbits
ran
in
every
direction
to
get
away
many
ran
right
among
the
horses
and
under
the
feet
of
the
cattle
and
under
the
wagons
so
that
the
teamsters
even
killed
some
with
a
whip
at
the
end
of
the
valley
we
went
into
camp
and
on
counting
up
the
game
found
we
had
over
or
about
one
for
every
person
in
camp
this
gave
us
a
feast
of
fresh
meat
not
often
found
it
was
on
this
trip
that
one
of
bennett
ox
drivers
was
taken
with
a
serious
bowel
difficulty
and
for
many
days
we
thought
he
would
die
but
he
eventually
recovered
his
name
was
silas
helmer
it
was
really
a
serious
moment
when
the
front
of
the
train
reached
the
smith
trail
team
after
team
turned
to
the
right
while
now
and
then
one
would
keep
straight
ahead
as
was
at
first
intended
capt
hunt
came
over
to
the
larger
party
after
the
division
was
made
and
wished
them
all
a
hearty
farewell
and
a
pleasant
happy
journey
my
friend
bennett
whose
fortune
i
shared
was
among
the
seceders
who
followed
the
smith
party
this
point
when
our
paths
diverged
was
very
near
the
place
afterward
made
notorious
as
mountain
meadows
where
the
famous
massacre
took
place
under
the
direction
of
the
mormon
generals
our
route
from
here
up
to
the
mountain
was
a
very
pleasant
one
steadily
up
grade
over
rolling
hills
with
wood
water
and
grass
in
plenty
we
came
at
last
to
what
seemed
the
summit
of
a
great
mountain
about
three
days
journey
on
the
new
trail
juniper
trees
grew
about
in
bunches
and
my
experience
with
this
timber
taught
me
that
we
were
on
elevated
ground
immediately
in
front
of
us
was
a
cañon
impassible
for
wagons
and
down
into
this
the
trail
descended
men
could
go
horses
and
mules
perhaps
but
wagons
could
no
longer
follow
that
trail
and
we
proposed
to
camp
while
explorers
were
sent
out
to
search
a
pass
across
this
steep
and
rocky
cañon
wood
and
bunch
grass
were
plenty
but
water
was
a
long
way
down
the
trail
and
had
to
be
packed
up
to
the
camp
two
days
passed
and
the
parties
sent
out
began
to
come
in
all
reporting
no
way
to
go
farther
with
the
wagons
some
said
the
trail
on
the
west
side
of
the
cañon
could
be
ascended
on
foot
by
both
men
and
mules
but
that
it
would
take
years
to
make
it
fit
for
wheels
the
enthusiasm
about
the
smith
had
begun
to
die
and
now
the
talk
began
of
going
back
to
follow
hunt
on
the
third
morning
a
lone
traveler
with
a
small
wagon
and
one
yoke
of
oxen
died
he
seemed
to
be
on
this
journey
to
seek
to
regain
his
health
he
was
from
kentucky
but
i
have
forgotten
his
name
some
were
very
active
about
his
wagon
and
some
thought
too
much
attention
was
paid
to
a
stranger
he
was
decently
buried
by
the
men
of
the
company
this
very
morning
a
rynierson
called
the
attention
of
the
crowd
and
made
some
remarks
upon
the
situation
he
said
my
family
is
near
and
dear
to
me
i
can
see
by
the
growth
of
the
timber
that
we
are
in
a
very
elevated
place
this
is
now
the
seventh
of
november
it
being
the
fourth
at
the
time
of
our
turning
off
on
this
trail
we
are
evidently
in
a
country
where
snow
is
liable
to
fall
at
any
time
in
the
winter
season
and
if
we
were
to
remain
here
and
be
caught
in
a
severe
storm
we
should
all
probably
perish
i
for
one
feel
in
duty
bound
to
seek
a
safer
way
than
this
i
shall
hitch
up
my
oxen
and
return
at
once
to
the
old
trail
boys
to
his
teamsters
get
the
cattle
and
we
return
this
was
decisive
and
rynierson
would
tarry
no
longer
many
others
now
proceeded
to
get
ready
and
follow
and
as
rynierson
drove
out
of
camp
quite
a
respectable
train
fell
in
behind
him
as
fast
as
the
hunters
came
in
and
reported
no
road
available
they
also
yoked
up
their
oxen
and
rolled
out
some
waited
awhile
for
companions
yet
in
the
fields
and
all
were
about
ready
to
move
when
a
party
came
in
with
news
that
the
pass
was
found
and
no
trouble
could
be
seen
ahead
about
wagons
remained
when
this
news
came
and
as
their
proprietors
had
brought
good
news
they
agreed
to
travel
on
westward
and
not
go
back
to
the
old
trail
bennett
had
gone
only
a
short
distance
out
when
he
had
the
misfortune
to
break
the
axle
of
his
wagon
and
he
then
went
back
to
camp
and
took
an
axle
out
of
the
dead
man
wagon
and
by
night
had
it
fitted
into
his
own
he
had
to
stay
until
morning
and
there
were
still
a
few
others
who
were
late
in
getting
a
start
who
camped
there
also
among
these
were
arcane
wife
and
child
two
earhart
brothers
and
sons
and
some
two
or
three
other
wagons
when
all
was
ready
we
followed
the
others
who
had
gone
ahead
the
route
led
at
first
directly
to
the
north
and
a
pass
was
said
to
be
in
that
direction
of
the
green
river
party
only
rodgers
and
myself
remained
with
this
train
after
the
wagons
straightened
out
nicely
a
meeting
was
called
to
organize
so
as
to
travel
systematically
a
feeling
was
very
manifest
that
those
without
any
families
did
not
care
to
bind
themselves
to
stand
by
and
assist
those
who
had
wives
and
children
in
their
party
and
there
was
considerable
debate
which
resulted
in
all
the
family
wagons
being
left
out
of
the
arrangements
a
party
who
called
themselves
the
jayhawkers
passed
us
and
we
followed
along
in
the
rear
over
rolling
hills
covered
with
juniper
timber
and
small
grassy
valleys
between
where
there
was
plenty
of
water
and
went
well
for
those
before
us
had
broken
out
the
road
so
we
could
roll
along
very
pleasantly
at
the
organization
jim
martin
was
chosen
captain
those
who
were
rejected
were
rev
brier
and
his
family
arcane
and
family
and
bennett
and
family
brier
would
not
stay
put
out
but
forced
himself
in
and
said
he
was
going
with
the
rest
and
so
he
did
but
the
other
families
remained
behind
i
attended
the
meeting
and
heard
what
was
said
but
bennett
was
my
friend
and
had
been
faithful
to
me
and
my
property
when
he
knew
not
where
i
was
and
so
i
decided
to
stand
by
him
and
his
wife
at
all
hazards
as
i
had
no
team
to
drive
i
took
every
opportunity
to
climb
the
mountains
along
the
route
reaching
the
highest
elevations
even
if
they
were
several
miles
from
the
trail
i
sometimes
remained
out
all
night
i
took
arcane
field
glass
with
me
and
was
thus
able
to
see
all
there
was
of
the
country
i
soon
became
satisfied
that
going
north
was
not
taking
us
in
the
direction
we
ought
to
go
i
frequently
told
them
so
but
they
still
persisted
in
following
on
i
went
to
the
leaders
and
told
them
we
were
going
back
toward
salt
lake
again
not
making
any
headway
toward
california
they
insisted
they
were
following
the
directions
of
williams
the
mountaineer
and
they
had
not
yet
got
as
far
north
as
he
indicated
i
told
them
and
bennett
and
others
that
we
must
either
turn
west
or
retrace
our
steps
and
get
back
into
the
regular
los
angeles
road
again
in
the
morning
we
held
another
consultation
and
decided
to
turn
west
here
and
leave
the
track
we
had
been
following
off
we
turned
at
nearly
right
angles
to
our
former
course
to
the
west
now
over
a
piece
of
table
land
that
gave
us
little
trouble
in
breaking
our
own
road
when
we
camped
the
oxen
seemed
very
fond
of
a
white
weed
that
was
very
plenty
and
some
borrowed
a
good
deal
of
trouble
thinking
that
perhaps
it
might
be
poison
i
learned
afterwards
that
this
plant
was
the
nutritious
white
sage
which
cattle
eat
freely
with
good
results
we
now
crossed
a
low
range
and
a
small
creek
running
south
and
here
were
also
some
springs
some
corn
had
been
grown
here
by
the
indians
pillars
of
sand
stone
fifteen
feet
high
and
very
slim
were
round
about
in
several
places
and
looked
strange
enough
the
next
piece
of
table
land
sloped
to
the
east
and
among
the
sage
grew
also
a
bunch
grass
a
foot
high
which
had
seeds
like
seeds
the
indians
had
gathered
the
grass
and
made
it
in
piles
of
one
hundred
pounds
or
so
and
used
it
for
food
as
i
found
by
examining
their
camps
one
day
i
climbed
a
high
mountain
where
some
pine
grew
in
order
to
get
a
view
of
the
country
as
i
neared
its
base
i
came
to
a
flat
rock
perhaps
fifty
feet
square
i
heard
some
pounding
noise
as
i
came
near
but
what
ever
it
was
it
ceased
on
my
approach
there
were
many
signs
of
the
rock
being
used
as
a
camp
such
as
pine
burrs
bones
of
various
kinds
of
animals
and
other
remains
of
food
which
lay
every
where
about
and
on
the
rock
near
the
center
was
a
small
oblong
stone
fitted
into
a
hole
i
took
it
out
and
found
it
covered
a
fine
well
of
water
about
three
feet
deep
and
was
thus
protected
against
any
small
animal
being
drowned
in
it
i
went
on
up
the
mountain
and
from
the
top
i
saw
that
the
land
west
of
us
looked
more
and
more
barren
the
second
night
the
brave
jayhawkers
who
had
been
so
firm
in
going
north
hove
in
sight
in
our
rear
they
had
at
last
concluded
to
accept
my
advice
and
had
came
over
our
road
quite
rapidly
we
all
camped
together
that
night
and
next
morning
they
took
the
lead
again
after
crossing
a
small
range
they
came
to
a
basin
which
seemed
to
have
no
outlet
and
was
very
barren
some
of
the
boys
in
advance
of
the
teams
had
passed
over
this
elevation
and
were
going
quite
rapidly
over
the
almost
level
plain
which
sloped
into
the
basin
when
they
saw
among
the
bunches
of
sage
brush
behind
them
a
small
party
of
indians
following
their
road
not
very
far
off
but
still
out
of
bow
and
arrow
range
the
boys
were
suddenly
able
to
take
much
longer
steps
than
usual
and
a
little
more
rapidly
too
and
swinging
round
toward
the
teams
as
soon
as
possible
for
they
already
had
some
fears
that
an
arrow
might
be
sticking
in
their
backs
in
an
unpleasantly
short
space
of
time
for
the
indians
were
good
travelers
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
wagons
the
indians
vanished
as
quickly
as
if
they
had
gone
into
a
hole
with
no
sign
remaining
except
a
small
dog
which
greatly
resembled
a
prairie
wolf
and
kept
a
safe
distance
away
no
one
could
imagine
where
the
fellows
went
so
suddenly
we
drove
to
the
west
side
of
this
basin
and
camped
near
the
foot
of
a
low
mountain
the
cattle
were
driven
down
into
the
basin
where
there
was
some
grass
but
at
camp
we
had
only
the
water
in
our
kegs
some
of
the
boys
climbed
the
mountain
on
the
north
but
found
no
springs
coming
down
a
cañon
they
found
some
rain
water
in
a
basin
in
the
rocks
and
all
took
a
good
drink
lew
west
lay
down
and
swallowed
all
he
could
and
then
told
the
boys
to
kill
him
for
he
never
would
feel
so
good
again
they
finished
the
pool
it
was
so
small
before
they
left
it
in
going
on
down
the
cañon
they
saw
an
indian
dodge
behind
some
big
rocks
and
searching
they
found
him
in
a
cave
as
still
as
a
dead
man
they
pulled
him
out
and
made
him
go
with
them
and
tried
every
way
to
find
out
from
him
where
they
were
and
where
owen
lake
was
as
they
had
been
told
the
lake
was
on
their
route
but
he
proved
to
be
no
wiser
than
a
man
of
mud
and
they
led
him
along
to
camp
put
a
red
flannel
shirt
on
him
to
cover
his
nakedness
and
made
him
sleep
between
two
white
men
so
he
could
not
get
away
easily
in
the
morning
they
were
more
successful
and
he
showed
us
a
small
ravine
four
miles
away
which
had
water
in
it
enough
for
our
use
and
we
moved
up
and
camped
there
while
the
boys
and
the
indian
started
over
a
barren
rocky
mountain
and
when
over
on
the
western
slope
they
were
led
to
a
water
hole
on
a
steep
rocky
cliff
where
no
one
but
an
indian
would
ever
think
of
looking
for
water
they
took
out
their
cups
and
had
a
good
drink
all
around
then
offered
the
indian
some
but
he
disdained
the
civilized
way
and
laying
down
his
bow
and
arrows
took
a
long
drink
directly
out
of
the
pool
he
was
so
long
in
getting
a
good
supply
that
the
boys
almost
forgot
him
as
they
were
gazing
over
the
distant
mountain
and
discussing
prospects
till
attracted
by
a
slight
noise
they
looked
and
saw
indian
going
down
over
the
cliffs
after
the
fashion
of
a
mountain
sheep
and
in
a
few
bounds
he
was
out
of
sight
they
could
not
have
killed
him
if
they
had
tried
the
move
so
sudden
and
unlooked
for
they
had
expected
the
fellow
to
show
them
the
way
to
owen
lake
but
now
their
guide
was
gone
and
left
nothing
to
remember
him
by
except
his
bow
and
arrows
so
they
returned
to
their
wagons
not
much
wiser
than
before
all
kinds
of
game
was
now
very
scarce
and
so
seldom
seen
that
the
men
got
tired
of
carrying
their
guns
and
grew
fearless
of
enemies
a
heavy
rifle
was
indeed
burdensome
over
so
long
a
road
when
there
was
no
frequent
use
for
it
the
party
kept
rolling
along
as
fast
as
possible
but
the
mountains
and
valleys
grew
more
barren
and
water
more
scarce
all
the
time
when
found
the
water
would
be
in
hole
at
the
outlet
of
some
cañon
or
in
little
pools
which
had
filled
up
with
rain
that
had
fallen
on
the
higher
ground
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
on
us
since
we
started
on
this
and
every
night
was
clear
and
warm
the
elevated
parts
of
the
country
seemed
to
be
isolated
buttes
with
no
running
streams
between
them
but
instead
dry
lakes
with
a
smooth
clay
bed
very
light
in
color
and
so
hard
that
the
track
of
an
ox
could
not
be
seen
on
its
glittering
surface
at
a
distance
those
clay
beds
looked
like
water
shining
in
the
sun
and
were
generally
about
three
times
as
far
as
any
one
would
judge
the
air
was
so
clear
this
mirage
or
resemblance
to
water
was
so
perfect
as
often
to
deceive
us
and
almost
to
our
ruin
on
one
or
two
occasions
i
took
arcane
field
glass
and
took
pains
to
ascend
all
the
high
buttes
within
a
day
walk
of
the
road
and
this
enabled
me
to
get
a
good
survey
of
the
country
north
and
west
i
would
sometimes
be
gone
two
or
three
days
with
no
luggage
but
my
canteen
and
gun
i
was
very
cautious
in
regard
to
indians
and
tried
to
keep
on
the
safe
side
of
surprises
i
would
build
a
fire
about
dark
and
then
travel
on
till
i
came
to
a
small
washed
place
and
lie
down
and
stay
till
morning
so
if
indian
did
come
to
my
fire
he
would
not
find
any
one
to
kill
one
day
i
was
going
up
a
wide
ravine
leading
to
the
summit
and
before
i
reached
the
highest
part
i
saw
a
smoke
curl
up
before
me
i
took
a
side
ravine
and
went
cautiously
bowed
down
pretty
low
so
no
one
could
see
me
and
when
near
the
top
of
the
ridge
and
about
one
hundred
yards
of
the
fire
i
ventured
to
raise
slowly
up
and
take
a
look
to
see
how
many
there
were
in
camp
i
could
see
but
two
and
as
i
looked
across
the
ravine
an
indian
woman
seemed
looking
at
me
also
but
i
was
so
low
she
could
only
see
the
top
of
my
head
and
i
sank
down
again
out
of
sight
i
crawled
further
up
so
as
to
get
a
better
view
and
when
i
straightened
up
again
she
got
a
full
view
of
me
she
instantly
caught
her
infant
off
its
little
pallet
made
of
a
small
piece
of
thin
wood
covered
with
a
rabbit
skin
and
putting
the
baby
under
one
arm
and
giving
a
smart
jerk
to
a
small
girl
that
was
crying
to
the
top
of
her
voice
she
bounded
off
and
fairly
flew
up
the
gentle
slope
toward
the
summit
the
girl
following
after
very
close
the
woman
long
black
hair
stood
out
as
she
rushed
along
looking
over
her
shoulder
every
instant
as
if
she
expected
to
be
slain
the
mother
flying
with
her
children
untrammeled
with
any
of
the
arts
of
fashion
was
the
best
natural
picture
i
ever
looked
upon
and
wild
in
the
extreme
no
living
artist
could
do
justice
to
the
scene
as
the
lady
of
the
desert
her
little
daughter
and
her
babe
passed
over
the
summit
out
of
sight
i
followed
but
when
i
reached
the
highest
summit
no
living
person
could
be
seen
i
looked
the
country
over
with
my
glass
the
region
to
the
north
was
black
rocky
and
very
mountainous
i
looked
some
time
and
then
concluded
i
had
better
not
go
any
further
that
way
for
i
might
be
waylaid
and
filled
with
arrows
at
some
unsuspected
moment
we
saw
indian
signs
almost
every
day
but
as
none
of
them
ever
came
to
our
camp
it
was
safe
to
say
they
were
not
friendly
i
now
turned
back
and
examined
the
indian
woman
camp
she
had
only
fire
enough
to
make
a
smoke
her
conical
shaped
basket
left
behind
contained
a
few
poor
arrows
and
some
cactus
leaves
from
which
the
spines
had
been
burned
and
there
lay
the
little
pallet
where
the
baby
was
sleeping
it
was
a
bare
looking
kitchen
for
hungry
folks
i
now
went
to
the
top
of
a
high
butte
and
scanned
the
country
very
carefully
especially
to
the
west
and
north
and
found
it
very
barren
there
were
no
trees
no
fertile
valleys
nor
anything
green
away
to
the
west
some
mountains
stood
out
clear
and
plain
their
summits
covered
white
with
snow
this
i
decided
was
our
objective
point
very
little
snow
could
be
seen
elsewhere
and
between
me
and
the
snowy
mountains
lay
a
low
black
rocky
range
and
a
wide
level
plain
that
had
no
signs
of
water
as
i
had
learned
them
in
our
trip
thus
far
across
the
country
the
black
range
seemed
to
run
nearly
north
and
south
and
to
the
north
and
northwest
the
country
looked
volcanic
black
and
desolate
as
i
looked
and
thought
i
believed
that
we
were
much
farther
from
a
fertile
region
then
most
of
our
party
had
any
idea
of
such
of
them
as
had
read
fremont
travels
and
most
of
them
going
to
california
had
fortified
themselves
before
starting
by
reading
fremont
said
that
the
mountains
were
near
california
and
were
fertile
from
their
very
summits
down
to
the
sea
but
that
to
the
east
of
the
mountains
it
was
a
desert
region
for
hundred
of
miles
as
i
explained
it
to
them
and
so
they
soon
saw
for
themselves
they
believed
that
the
snowy
range
ahead
of
us
was
the
last
range
to
cross
before
we
entered
the
california
and
it
seemed
not
far
off
and
prospect
quite
encouraging
our
road
had
been
winding
around
among
the
buttes
which
looked
like
the
indian
baskets
turned
upside
down
on
the
great
barren
plain
what
water
we
found
was
in
small
pools
in
the
places
near
the
foothills
at
the
edge
of
the
valley
probably
running
down
the
ravines
after
some
storm
there
were
dry
lake
beds
scattered
around
over
the
plain
but
it
did
not
seem
as
if
there
had
ever
been
volume
of
water
enough
lately
to
force
itself
out
so
far
into
the
plain
as
these
lakes
were
all
the
lakes
appeared
about
the
same
the
bed
white
and
glistening
in
the
sun
which
made
it
very
hard
for
the
eyes
and
so
that
a
man
in
passing
over
it
made
no
visible
track
it
looked
as
if
it
one
time
might
have
been
a
smooth
bed
of
plastic
mortar
and
had
hardened
in
the
sun
it
looked
as
if
there
must
have
been
water
there
sometime
but
we
had
not
seen
a
drop
or
a
single
cloud
every
day
was
clear
and
sunny
and
very
warm
and
at
night
no
stars
forgot
to
shine
our
oxen
began
to
look
bad
for
they
had
poor
food
grass
had
been
very
scarce
and
now
when
we
unyoked
them
and
turned
them
out
they
did
not
care
to
look
around
much
for
something
to
eat
they
moved
slowly
and
cropped
disdainfully
the
dry
scattering
shrubs
and
bunches
of
grass
from
six
inches
to
a
foot
high
spending
many
nights
and
days
on
such
dry
food
and
without
water
they
suffered
fearfully
and
though
fat
and
sleek
when
we
started
from
salt
lake
they
now
looked
gaunt
and
poor
and
dragged
themselves
slowly
along
poor
faithful
servants
of
mankind
no
one
knew
how
long
before
we
might
have
to
kill
some
of
them
to
get
food
to
save
our
own
lives
we
now
traveled
several
days
down
the
bed
of
a
broad
ravine
which
led
to
a
southwest
direction
there
seemed
to
be
a
continuous
range
of
mountains
on
the
south
but
to
the
north
was
the
level
plain
with
scattered
buttes
and
what
we
had
all
along
called
dry
lakes
for
up
to
this
time
we
had
seen
no
water
in
any
of
them
i
had
carried
my
rifle
with
me
every
day
since
we
took
this
route
and
though
i
was
an
experienced
hunter
a
professional
one
if
there
be
such
a
thing
i
had
killed
only
one
rabbit
and
where
no
game
lived
i
got
as
hungry
as
other
folks
our
line
soon
brought
us
in
sight
of
a
high
butte
which
stood
apparently
about
miles
south
of
our
route
and
i
determined
to
visit
and
climb
it
to
get
a
better
view
of
things
ahead
i
walked
steadily
all
day
and
reached
the
summit
about
dusk
i
wandered
around
among
the
big
rocks
and
found
a
projecting
cliff
where
i
would
be
protected
from
enemies
wind
or
storm
and
here
i
made
my
camp
while
the
light
lasted
i
gathered
a
small
stock
of
fuel
which
consisted
of
a
stunted
growth
of
sage
and
other
small
shrubs
dry
but
not
dead
and
with
this
i
built
a
little
fire
indian
fashion
and
sat
down
close
to
it
here
was
a
good
chance
for
undisturbed
meditation
and
someway
i
could
not
get
around
doing
a
little
meditating
as
i
added
a
new
bit
of
fuel
now
and
then
to
the
small
fire
burning
at
my
side
i
thought
it
looked
dark
and
troublesome
before
us
i
took
a
stone
for
a
pillow
with
my
hat
on
it
for
a
cushion
and
lying
down
close
under
the
shelving
rock
i
went
to
sleep
for
i
was
very
tired
i
woke
soon
from
being
cold
for
the
butte
was
pretty
high
and
so
i
busied
myself
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
adding
little
sticks
to
the
fire
which
gave
me
some
warmth
and
thus
in
solitude
i
spent
the
night
i
was
glad
enough
to
see
the
day
break
over
the
eastern
mountains
and
light
up
the
vast
barren
country
i
could
see
on
every
hand
around
me
when
the
sun
was
fairly
up
i
took
a
good
survey
of
the
situation
and
it
seemed
as
if
pretty
near
all
creation
was
in
sight
north
and
west
was
a
level
plain
fully
one
hundred
miles
wide
it
seemed
and
from
anything
i
could
see
it
would
not
afford
a
traveler
a
single
drink
in
the
whole
distance
or
give
a
poor
ox
many
mouthfuls
of
grass
on
the
western
edge
it
was
bounded
by
a
low
black
and
rocky
range
extending
nearly
north
and
south
for
a
long
distance
and
no
pass
though
it
which
i
could
see
and
beyond
this
range
still
another
one
apparently
parallel
to
it
in
a
due
west
course
from
me
was
the
high
peak
we
had
been
looking
at
for
a
month
and
lowest
place
was
on
the
north
side
which
we
had
named
martin
pass
and
had
been
trying
so
long
to
reach
this
high
peak
covered
with
snow
glistened
to
the
morning
sun
and
as
the
air
was
clear
from
clouds
or
fog
and
no
dust
or
haze
to
obscure
the
view
it
seemed
very
near
i
had
learned
by
experience
that
objects
a
day
walk
distant
seemed
close
by
in
such
a
light
and
that
when
clear
lakes
appeared
only
a
little
distance
in
our
front
we
might
search
and
search
and
never
find
them
we
had
to
learn
how
to
look
for
water
in
this
peculiar
way
in
my
wisconsin
travel
i
had
learned
that
when
i
struck
a
ravine
i
must
go
down
to
look
for
living
water
but
here
we
must
invariably
travel
upward
for
the
water
was
only
found
in
the
high
mountains
prospects
now
seemed
to
me
so
hopeless
that
i
heartily
wished
i
was
not
in
duty
bound
to
stand
by
the
women
and
small
children
who
could
never
reach
a
land
of
bread
without
assistance
if
i
was
in
the
position
that
some
of
them
were
who
had
only
themselves
to
look
after
i
could
pick
up
my
knapsack
and
gun
and
go
off
feeling
i
had
no
dependent
ones
to
leave
behind
but
as
it
was
i
felt
i
should
be
morally
guilty
of
murder
if
i
should
forsake
bennett
wife
and
children
and
the
family
of
arcane
with
whom
i
had
been
thus
far
associated
it
was
a
dark
line
of
thought
but
i
always
felt
better
when
i
got
around
to
the
determination
as
i
always
did
to
stand
by
my
friends
their
wives
and
children
let
come
what
might
i
could
see
with
my
glass
the
train
of
wagons
moving
slowly
over
the
plain
toward
what
looked
to
me
like
a
large
lake
i
made
a
guess
of
the
point
they
would
reach
by
night
and
then
took
a
straight
course
for
it
all
day
long
in
steady
travel
it
was
some
time
after
dark
and
i
was
still
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
camp
fires
where
in
the
bed
of
a
cañon
i
stepped
into
some
mud
which
was
a
sign
of
water
i
poked
around
in
the
dark
for
a
while
and
soon
found
a
little
pool
of
it
and
having
been
without
a
drop
of
it
for
two
days
i
lay
down
and
took
a
hasty
drink
it
did
not
seem
to
be
very
clear
or
clean
but
it
was
certainly
wet
which
was
the
main
thing
just
then
the
next
morning
i
went
to
the
pond
of
water
and
found
the
oxen
had
been
watered
there
they
stirred
up
the
mud
a
good
deal
and
had
drank
off
about
all
the
clean
part
which
seemed
to
refresh
them
very
much
i
found
the
people
in
the
camp
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
i
had
seen
from
the
mountain
and
fortunately
it
contained
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
water
they
had
dug
some
holes
here
which
filled
up
and
they
were
using
this
water
in
the
camp
the
ambitious
of
our
party
had
by
this
time
abandoned
that
sort
of
work
and
i
was
left
alone
to
look
about
and
try
to
ascertain
the
character
of
the
road
they
were
to
follow
it
was
a
great
deal
to
do
to
look
out
for
food
for
the
oxen
and
for
water
for
the
camp
and
besides
all
this
it
was
plain
there
were
indians
about
even
if
we
did
not
see
them
there
were
many
signs
and
i
had
to
be
always
on
the
lookout
to
outgeneral
them
when
the
people
found
i
was
in
camp
this
night
they
came
around
to
our
wagons
to
know
what
i
had
seen
and
found
and
what
the
prospects
were
ahead
above
all
they
wanted
to
know
how
far
it
was
in
my
opinion
to
the
end
of
our
journey
i
listened
to
all
their
inquiries
and
told
them
plainly
what
i
had
seen
and
what
i
thought
of
the
prospect
i
did
not
like
telling
the
whole
truth
about
it
for
fear
it
might
dampen
their
spirits
but
being
pressed
for
an
opinion
i
told
them
in
plain
words
that
it
would
at
least
be
another
month
before
their
journey
would
be
ended
they
seemed
to
think
i
ought
to
be
pretty
good
authority
and
if
i
was
not
mistaken
the
oxen
would
get
very
poor
and
provisions
very
scarce
before
we
could
pull
through
so
long
i
was
up
at
day
break
and
found
bennett
sitting
by
the
fire
about
the
first
thing
he
said
lewis
if
you
please
i
do
want
you
hereafter
to
express
your
views
so
openly
and
emphatically
as
you
did
last
night
about
our
prospects
last
night
when
i
went
to
bed
i
found
sarah
his
wife
crying
and
when
pressed
for
the
cause
she
said
she
had
heard
your
remarks
on
the
situation
and
that
if
lewis
said
so
it
must
be
correct
for
he
knows
more
about
it
than
all
of
you
she
felt
that
she
and
the
children
must
starve
in
the
morning
jayhawkers
and
others
of
the
train
that
were
not
considered
strictly
of
our
own
party
yoked
up
and
started
due
west
across
the
level
plain
which
i
had
predicted
as
having
no
water
and
i
really
thought
they
would
never
live
to
get
across
to
the
western
border
culverwell
and
mr
fish
stayed
with
us
making
another
wagon
in
our
train
we
talked
about
the
matter
carefully
i
did
not
think
it
possible
to
get
across
that
plain
in
less
than
four
or
six
days
and
i
did
not
believe
there
was
a
drop
of
water
on
the
route
to
the
south
of
us
was
a
mountain
that
now
had
considerable
snow
upon
its
summit
and
some
small
pine
trees
also
doubtless
we
could
find
plenty
of
water
at
the
base
but
being
due
south
it
was
quite
off
our
course
the
prospects
for
reaching
water
were
so
much
better
in
that
way
that
we
finally
decided
to
go
there
rather
than
follow
the
jayhawkers
on
their
desolate
tramp
over
the
dry
plain
so
we
turned
up
a
cañon
leading
toward
the
mountain
and
had
a
pretty
heavy
up
grade
and
a
rough
bed
for
a
road
part
way
up
we
came
to
a
high
cliff
and
in
its
face
were
niches
or
cavities
as
large
as
a
barrel
or
larger
and
in
some
of
them
we
found
balls
of
a
glistening
substance
looking
something
like
pieces
of
varigated
candy
stuck
together
the
balls
were
as
large
as
small
pumpkins
it
was
evidently
food
of
some
sort
and
we
found
it
sweet
but
sickish
and
those
who
were
so
hungry
as
to
break
up
one
of
the
balls
and
divide
it
among
the
others
making
a
good
meal
of
it
were
a
little
troubled
with
nausea
afterwards
i
considered
it
bad
policy
to
rob
the
indians
of
any
of
their
food
for
they
must
be
pretty
smart
people
to
live
in
this
desolate
country
and
find
enough
to
keep
them
alive
and
i
was
pretty
sure
we
might
count
them
as
hostiles
as
they
never
came
near
our
camp
like
other
indians
they
were
probably
revengeful
and
might
seek
to
have
revenge
on
us
for
the
injury
we
considered
it
prudent
to
keep
careful
watch
for
them
so
they
might
not
surprise
us
with
a
volley
of
arrows
the
second
night
we
camped
near
the
head
of
the
cañon
we
had
been
following
but
thus
far
there
had
been
no
water
and
only
some
stunted
sage
brush
for
the
oxen
which
they
did
not
like
and
only
ate
it
when
near
the
point
of
starvation
they
stood
around
the
camp
looking
as
sorry
as
oxen
can
during
the
night
a
stray
and
crazy
looking
cloud
passed
over
us
and
left
its
moisture
on
the
mountain
to
the
shape
of
a
coat
of
snow
several
inches
deep
when
daylight
came
the
oxen
crowded
around
the
wagons
shivering
with
cold
and
licking
up
the
snow
to
quench
their
thirst
we
took
pattern
after
them
and
melted
snow
to
get
water
for
ourselves
by
the
looks
of
our
cattle
it
did
not
seem
as
if
they
could
pull
much
and
light
loads
were
advisable
on
this
up
grade
bennett
was
a
carpenter
and
had
brought
along
some
good
tools
in
his
wagon
these
he
reluctantly
unloaded
and
almost
everything
else
except
bedding
and
provisions
and
leaving
them
upon
the
ground
we
rolled
up
the
hills
slowly
with
loads
as
light
as
possible
rogers
and
i
went
ahead
with
our
guns
to
look
out
the
way
and
find
a
good
camping
place
after
a
few
miles
we
got
out
of
the
snow
and
out
upon
an
incline
and
in
the
bright
clear
morning
air
the
foot
of
the
snowy
part
of
the
mountain
seemed
near
by
and
we
were
sure
we
could
reach
it
before
night
from
here
no
guide
was
needed
and
rogers
and
i
with
our
guns
and
canteens
hurried
on
as
fast
as
possible
when
a
camp
was
found
we
were
to
raise
a
signal
smoke
to
tell
them
where
it
was
we
were
here
as
before
badly
deceived
as
to
the
distance
and
we
marched
steadily
and
swiftly
till
nearly
night
before
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
here
was
a
flat
place
in
a
table
land
and
on
it
a
low
brush
hut
with
a
small
smoke
near
by
which
we
could
plainly
see
as
we
were
in
the
shade
of
the
mountain
and
that
place
lighted
up
by
the
nearly
setting
sun
we
looked
carefully
and
satisfied
ourselves
there
was
but
one
hut
and
consequently
but
few
people
could
be
expected
we
approached
carefully
and
cautiously
making
a
circuit
around
so
as
to
get
between
the
hut
and
the
hill
in
case
that
the
occupants
should
retreat
in
that
direction
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
could
see
any
entrance
to
this
wickiup
but
we
found
it
at
last
and
approached
directly
in
front
very
cautiously
indeed
we
could
see
no
one
and
thought
perhaps
they
were
in
ambush
for
us
but
hardly
probable
as
we
had
kept
closely
out
of
sight
we
consulted
a
moment
and
concluded
to
make
an
advance
and
if
possible
capture
some
one
who
could
tell
us
about
the
country
as
we
felt
we
were
completely
lost
when
within
thirty
yards
a
man
poked
out
his
head
out
of
a
doorway
and
drew
it
back
again
quick
as
a
flash
we
kept
out
our
guns
at
full
cock
and
ready
for
use
and
told
rogers
to
look
out
for
arrows
for
they
would
come
now
if
ever
but
they
did
not
pull
a
bow
on
us
and
the
almost
naked
came
out
and
beckoned
for
us
to
come
on
which
we
did
we
tried
to
talk
with
the
fellow
in
the
sign
language
but
he
could
understand
about
as
much
as
an
oyster
i
made
a
little
basin
in
the
ground
and
filled
it
with
water
from
our
canteens
to
represent
a
lake
then
pointed
in
an
inquiring
way
west
and
north
made
signs
of
ducks
and
geese
flying
and
squawking
but
i
did
no
seem
to
be
able
to
get
an
idea
into
his
head
of
what
we
wanted
i
got
thoroughly
provoked
at
him
and
may
have
shown
some
signs
of
anger
during
all
this
time
a
child
or
two
in
the
hut
squalled
terribly
fearing
i
suppose
they
would
all
be
murdered
we
might
have
lost
our
scalps
under
some
circumstances
but
we
appeared
to
be
fully
the
strangest
party
and
had
no
fear
for
the
indian
had
no
weapon
about
him
and
we
had
both
guns
and
knives
the
poor
fellow
was
shivering
with
cold
and
with
signs
of
friendship
we
fired
off
one
of
the
guns
which
waked
him
up
a
little
and
he
pointed
to
the
gun
and
said
walker
probably
meaning
the
same
good
chief
walker
who
had
so
fortunately
stopped
us
in
our
journey
down
green
river
i
understood
from
the
indian
that
he
was
not
friendly
to
walker
but
to
show
that
he
was
all
right
with
us
he
went
into
the
hut
and
brought
out
a
handful
of
corn
for
us
to
eat
by
the
aid
of
a
warm
spring
near
by
they
had
raised
some
corn
here
and
the
dry
stalks
were
standing
around
as
we
were
about
to
leave
i
told
him
we
would
come
back
next
day
and
bring
him
some
clothes
if
we
could
find
any
to
spare
and
then
we
shouldered
our
guns
and
went
back
toward
the
wagons
looking
over
our
shoulders
occasionally
to
see
if
we
were
followed
we
walked
fast
down
the
hill
and
reached
the
camp
about
dark
to
find
it
a
most
unhappy
one
indeed
bennett
and
arcane
were
in
distress
the
four
children
were
crying
for
water
but
there
was
not
a
drop
to
give
them
and
none
could
be
reached
before
some
time
next
day
the
mothers
were
nearly
crazy
for
they
expected
the
children
would
choke
with
thirst
and
die
in
their
arms
and
would
rather
perish
themselves
than
suffer
the
agony
of
seeing
their
little
ones
gasp
and
slowly
die
they
reproached
themselves
as
being
the
cause
of
all
this
trouble
for
the
love
of
gold
they
had
left
homes
where
hunger
had
never
come
and
often
in
sleep
dreamed
of
the
bounteous
tables
of
their
old
homes
only
to
be
woefully
disappointed
in
the
morning
there
was
great
gladness
when
john
rogers
and
i
appeared
in
the
camp
and
gave
the
mothers
full
canteens
of
water
for
themselves
and
little
ones
and
there
was
tears
of
joy
and
thankfulness
upon
their
cheeks
as
they
blessed
us
over
and
over
again
the
oxen
fared
very
hard
the
ground
was
made
up
of
broken
stone
and
all
that
grew
was
a
dry
and
stunted
brush
not
more
than
six
inches
high
of
which
the
poor
animals
took
an
occasional
dainty
bite
and
seemed
hardly
able
to
drag
along
it
was
only
seven
or
eight
miles
to
the
warm
spring
and
all
felt
better
to
know
for
a
certainty
that
we
would
soon
be
safe
again
we
started
early
even
the
women
walked
so
as
to
favor
the
poor
oxen
all
we
could
when
within
two
miles
of
the
water
some
of
the
oxen
lay
down
and
refused
to
rise
again
so
we
had
to
leave
them
and
a
wagon
while
the
rest
pushed
on
and
reached
the
spring
soon
after
noon
we
took
water
and
went
back
to
the
oxen
left
behind
and
gave
them
some
to
drink
they
were
somewhat
rested
and
got
up
and
we
tried
to
drive
them
in
without
the
wagons
but
they
were
not
inclined
to
travel
without
the
yoke
so
we
put
it
on
them
and
hitched
to
the
wagon
again
the
yoke
and
the
wagon
seemed
to
brace
them
up
a
good
deal
and
they
went
along
thus
much
better
than
when
alone
and
scattered
about
with
nothing
to
lean
upon
the
warm
spring
was
quite
large
and
ran
a
hundred
yards
or
more
before
the
water
sank
down
into
the
dry
and
thirsty
desert
the
dry
cornstalks
of
last
years
crop
some
small
willows
sagebrush
weeds
and
grass
suited
our
animals
very
well
and
they
ate
better
than
for
a
long
time
and
we
thought
it
best
to
remain
two
or
three
days
to
give
them
a
chance
to
get
rest
the
indian
we
left
here
the
evening
before
had
gone
and
left
nothing
behind
but
a
chunk
of
crystallized
rock
salt
he
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
his
friends
the
range
we
had
been
traveling
nearly
parallel
with
seemed
to
come
to
an
end
here
where
this
snow
peak
stood
and
immediately
north
and
south
of
this
peak
there
seemed
to
be
a
lower
pass
the
continuous
range
north
was
too
low
to
hold
snow
in
the
morning
i
concluded
to
go
to
the
summit
of
that
pass
and
with
my
glass
have
an
extensive
view
two
other
boys
started
with
me
and
as
we
moved
along
the
snow
line
we
saw
tracks
of
our
runaway
indian
in
the
snow
passing
over
a
low
ridge
as
we
went
on
up
hill
our
boys
began
to
fall
behind
and
long
before
night
i
could
see
nothing
of
them
the
ground
was
quite
soft
and
i
saw
many
tracks
of
indians
which
put
me
on
my
guard
i
reached
the
summit
and
as
the
shade
of
its
mountain
began
to
make
it
a
little
dark
i
built
a
fire
of
sage
brush
ate
my
grub
and
when
it
was
fairly
dark
renewed
the
fire
and
passed
on
a
mile
where
in
a
small
ravine
with
banks
two
feet
high
i
lay
down
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
slept
till
morning
i
did
this
to
beat
the
indian
in
his
own
cunning
next
morning
i
reached
the
summit
about
nine
and
had
the
grandest
view
i
ever
saw
i
could
see
north
and
south
almost
forever
the
surrounding
region
seemed
lower
but
much
of
it
black
mountainous
and
barren
on
the
west
the
snow
peak
shut
out
the
view
in
that
direction
to
the
south
the
mountains
seemed
to
descend
for
more
than
twenty
miles
and
near
the
base
perhaps
ten
miles
away
were
several
smokes
apparently
from
camp
fires
and
as
i
could
see
no
animals
or
camp
wagons
anywhere
i
presumed
them
to
be
indians
a
few
miles
to
the
north
and
east
of
where
i
stood
and
somewhat
higher
was
the
roughest
piece
of
ground
i
ever
saw
it
stood
in
sharp
peaks
and
was
of
many
colors
some
of
them
so
red
that
the
mountain
looked
red
hot
i
imagined
it
to
be
a
true
volcanic
point
and
had
never
been
so
near
one
before
and
the
most
wonderful
picture
of
grand
desolation
one
could
ever
see
toward
the
north
i
could
see
the
desert
the
jayhawkers
and
their
comrades
had
under
taken
to
cross
and
if
their
journey
was
as
troublesome
as
ours
and
very
much
longer
they
might
by
this
time
be
all
dead
of
thirst
i
remained
on
this
summit
an
hour
or
so
bringing
my
glass
to
bear
on
all
points
within
my
view
and
scanning
closely
for
everything
that
might
help
us
or
prove
an
obstacle
to
our
progress
the
more
i
looked
the
more
i
satisfied
myself
that
we
were
yet
a
long
way
from
california
and
the
serious
question
of
our
ever
living
to
get
there
presented
itself
to
me
as
i
tramped
along
down
the
grade
to
camp
i
put
down
at
least
another
month
of
heavy
weary
travel
before
we
could
hope
to
make
the
land
of
gold
and
our
stock
of
strength
and
provisions
were
both
pretty
small
for
so
great
a
tax
upon
them
i
thought
so
little
about
anything
else
that
the
indians
might
have
captured
me
easily
for
i
jogged
along
without
a
thought
of
them
i
thought
of
the
bounteous
stock
of
bread
and
beans
upon
my
father
table
to
say
nothing
about
all
the
other
good
things
and
here
was
i
the
oldest
son
away
out
in
the
center
of
the
great
american
desert
with
an
empty
stomach
and
a
dry
and
parched
throat
and
clothes
fast
wearing
out
with
constant
wear
and
perhaps
i
had
not
yet
seen
the
worst
of
it
i
might
be
forced
to
see
men
and
the
women
and
children
of
our
party
choke
and
die
powerless
to
help
them
it
was
a
darker
gloomier
day
than
i
had
ever
known
could
be
and
alone
i
wept
aloud
for
i
believed
i
could
see
the
future
and
the
results
were
bitter
to
contemplate
i
hope
no
reader
of
this
history
may
ever
be
placed
in
a
position
to
be
thus
tried
for
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
have
a
weak
point
to
show
under
such
circumstances
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
tell
how
much
i
suffered
in
my
lonely
trips
lasting
sometimes
days
and
nights
that
i
might
give
the
best
advice
to
those
of
my
party
i
believed
that
i
could
escape
at
any
time
myself
but
all
must
be
brought
through
or
perish
and
with
this
all
i
knew
i
must
not
discourage
the
others
i
could
tell
them
the
truth
but
i
must
keep
my
worst
apprehensions
to
myself
lest
they
loose
heart
and
hope
and
faith
needlessly
i
reached
the
camp
on
the
third
day
where
i
found
the
boys
who
went
part
way
with
me
and
whom
i
had
i
related
to
the
whole
camp
what
i
had
seen
and
when
all
was
told
it
appeared
that
the
route
from
the
mountains
westerly
was
the
only
route
that
could
be
taken
they
told
me
of
a
discovery
they
had
made
of
a
pile
of
squashes
probably
raised
upon
the
place
and
sufficient
in
number
so
that
every
person
could
have
one
i
did
not
approve
of
this
for
we
had
no
title
to
this
produce
and
might
be
depriving
the
rightful
owner
of
the
means
of
life
i
told
them
not
only
was
it
wrong
to
rob
them
of
their
food
but
they
could
easily
revenge
themselves
on
us
by
shooting
our
cattle
or
scalp
us
by
gathering
a
company
of
their
own
people
together
they
had
no
experience
with
red
men
and
were
slow
to
see
the
results
i
spoke
of
as
possible
during
my
absence
an
ox
had
been
killed
for
some
were
nearly
out
of
provisions
and
flesh
was
the
only
means
to
prevent
starvation
the
meat
was
distributed
amongst
the
entire
camp
with
the
understanding
that
when
it
became
necessary
to
kill
another
it
should
be
divided
in
the
same
way
some
one
of
the
wagons
would
have
to
be
left
for
lack
of
animals
to
draw
it
our
animals
were
so
poor
that
one
would
not
last
long
as
food
no
fat
could
be
found
on
the
entire
carcass
and
the
marrow
of
the
great
bones
was
a
thick
liquid
streaked
with
blood
resembling
corruption
our
road
led
us
around
the
base
of
the
mountain
there
were
many
large
rocks
in
our
way
some
as
large
as
houses
but
we
wound
around
among
them
in
a
very
crooked
way
and
managed
to
get
along
the
feet
of
the
oxen
became
so
sore
that
we
made
moccasins
for
them
from
the
hide
of
the
ox
that
was
killed
and
with
this
protection
they
got
along
very
well
our
trains
now
consisted
of
seven
wagons
bennett
had
two
arcane
two
earhart
one
culverwell
fish
and
others
one
and
there
was
one
other
the
owners
of
which
i
have
forgotten
the
second
night
we
had
a
fair
camp
with
water
and
pretty
fair
grass
and
brush
for
the
oxen
we
were
not
very
far
from
the
snow
line
and
this
had
some
effect
on
the
country
when
bennett
retired
that
night
he
put
on
a
camp
kettle
of
the
fresh
beef
and
so
arranged
the
fire
that
it
would
cook
slowly
and
be
done
by
daylight
for
breakfast
after
an
hour
or
so
bennett
went
out
to
replenish
the
fire
and
see
how
the
cooking
was
coming
on
and
when
i
went
to
put
more
water
in
the
kettle
he
found
that
to
his
disappointment
the
most
of
the
meat
was
gone
i
was
rolled
up
in
my
blanket
under
his
wagon
and
awoke
when
he
came
to
the
fire
and
saw
him
stand
and
look
around
as
if
to
fasten
the
crime
on
the
right
party
if
possible
but
soon
he
came
to
me
and
in
a
whisper
said
did
you
see
anyone
around
the
fire
after
we
went
to
bed
i
assured
him
i
did
not
and
then
he
told
me
some
one
had
taken
his
meat
do
you
think
said
he
that
any
one
is
so
near
out
of
food
as
to
be
starving
i
know
the
meat
is
poor
and
who
ever
took
it
must
be
nearly
starving
after
a
whispered
conversation
we
went
to
bed
but
we
both
rose
at
daylight
and
as
we
sat
by
the
fire
kept
watch
of
those
who
got
up
and
came
around
we
thought
we
knew
the
right
man
but
were
not
sure
and
could
not
imagine
what
might
happen
if
stealing
grub
should
begin
and
continue
it
is
a
sort
of
unwritten
law
that
in
parties
such
as
ours
he
who
steals
provisions
forfeits
his
life
we
knew
we
must
keep
watch
and
if
the
offense
was
repeated
the
guilty
one
might
be
compelled
to
suffer
bennett
watched
closely
and
for
a
few
days
i
kept
closely
with
the
wagons
for
fear
there
might
be
trouble
it
was
really
the
most
critical
point
in
our
experience
after
three
or
four
days
all
hope
of
detecting
the
criminal
had
passed
and
all
danger
was
over
out
of
any
difficulty
one
night
we
had
a
fair
camp
as
we
were
close
to
the
base
of
the
snow
butte
and
found
a
hole
of
clear
or
what
seemed
to
be
living
water
there
were
a
few
minnows
in
it
not
much
more
than
an
inch
long
this
was
among
a
big
pile
of
rocks
and
around
these
the
oxen
found
some
grass
there
now
appeared
to
be
a
pass
away
to
the
south
as
a
sort
of
outlet
to
the
great
plain
which
lay
to
the
north
of
us
but
immediately
west
and
across
the
desert
waste
extending
to
the
foot
of
a
low
black
range
of
mountains
through
which
there
seemed
to
be
no
pass
the
distant
snowy
peak
lay
still
farther
on
with
martin
pass
over
it
still
a
long
way
off
though
we
had
been
steering
toward
it
for
a
month
now
as
we
were
compelled
to
go
west
this
impassable
barrier
was
in
our
way
and
if
no
pass
could
be
found
in
it
we
would
be
compelled
to
go
south
and
make
no
progress
in
a
westerly
direction
our
trail
was
now
descending
to
the
bottom
of
what
seemed
to
be
the
narrowest
part
of
the
plain
the
same
one
the
jayhawkers
had
started
across
further
north
ten
days
before
when
we
reached
the
lowest
part
of
this
valley
we
came
to
a
running
stream
and
as
dead
grass
could
be
seen
in
the
bed
where
the
water
ran
very
slowly
i
concluded
it
only
had
water
in
it
after
hard
rains
in
the
mountains
perhaps
a
hundred
miles
to
the
north
this
water
was
not
pure
it
had
a
bitter
taste
and
no
doubt
in
dry
weather
was
a
rank
poison
those
who
partook
of
it
were
affected
about
as
if
they
had
taken
a
big
dose
of
salts
a
short
distance
above
this
we
found
the
trail
of
the
jayhawkers
going
west
and
thus
we
knew
they
had
got
safely
across
the
great
plain
and
then
turned
southward
i
hurried
along
their
trail
for
several
miles
and
looked
the
country
over
with
field
glass
becoming
fully
satisfied
we
should
find
no
water
till
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
next
range
and
then
fearing
the
party
had
not
taken
the
precaution
to
bring
along
some
water
i
went
back
to
them
and
found
they
had
none
i
told
them
they
would
not
see
a
drop
for
the
next
forty
miles
and
they
unloaded
the
lightest
wagon
and
drove
back
with
everything
they
had
which
would
hold
water
to
get
a
good
supply
i
turned
back
again
on
the
jayhawker
road
and
followed
it
so
rapidly
that
well
toward
night
i
was
pretty
near
the
summit
where
a
pass
through
this
rocky
range
had
been
found
and
on
this
mountain
not
a
tree
a
shrub
or
spear
of
grass
could
be
found
desolation
beyond
conception
i
carried
my
gun
along
every
day
but
for
the
want
of
a
chance
to
kill
any
game
a
single
load
would
remain
in
my
gun
for
a
month
very
seldom
a
rabbit
could
be
seen
but
not
a
bird
of
any
kind
not
even
a
hawk
buzzard
or
crow
made
their
appearance
here
when
near
the
steep
part
of
the
mountain
i
found
a
dead
ox
the
jayhawkers
had
left
as
no
camp
could
be
made
here
for
lack
of
water
and
grass
the
meat
could
not
be
saved
i
found
the
body
of
the
animal
badly
shrunken
but
in
condition
as
far
as
putrefaction
was
concerned
as
perfect
as
when
alive
a
big
gash
had
been
cut
in
the
ham
clear
to
the
bone
and
the
sun
had
dried
the
flesh
in
this
i
was
so
awful
hungry
that
i
took
my
sheath
knife
and
cut
a
big
steak
which
i
devoured
as
i
walked
along
without
cooking
or
salt
some
may
say
they
would
starve
before
eating
such
meat
but
if
they
have
ever
experienced
hunger
till
it
begins
to
draw
down
the
life
itself
they
will
find
the
impulse
of
self
preservation
something
not
to
be
controlled
by
mere
reason
it
is
an
instinct
that
takes
possession
of
one
in
spite
of
himself
i
went
down
a
narrow
dark
cañon
high
on
both
sides
and
perpendicular
and
quite
so
in
many
places
in
one
of
the
perpendicular
portions
it
seemed
to
be
a
varigated
clay
formation
and
a
little
water
seeped
down
its
face
here
the
indians
had
made
a
clay
bowl
and
fastened
it
to
the
wall
so
that
it
would
collect
and
retain
about
a
quart
of
water
and
i
had
a
good
drink
of
water
the
first
one
since
leaving
the
running
stream
near
here
i
staid
all
night
for
fear
of
indians
who
i
firmly
believe
would
have
taken
my
scalp
had
a
good
opportunity
offered
i
slept
without
a
fire
and
my
supply
of
meat
just
obtained
drove
hunger
away
in
the
morning
i
started
down
the
cañon
which
descended
rapidly
and
had
a
bed
of
sharp
volcanic
broken
rock
i
could
sometimes
see
an
indian
track
and
kept
a
sharp
lookout
at
every
turn
for
fear
of
revenge
on
account
of
the
store
of
squashes
which
had
been
taken
i
felt
i
was
in
constant
danger
but
could
do
nothing
else
but
go
on
and
keep
eyes
open
trusting
to
circumstances
to
get
out
of
any
sudden
emergency
that
might
arise
as
i
recollect
this
was
christmas
day
and
about
dusk
i
came
upon
the
camp
of
one
man
with
his
wife
and
family
the
rev
brier
brier
and
two
sons
i
inquired
for
others
of
his
party
and
he
told
me
they
were
somewhere
ahead
when
i
arrived
at
his
camp
i
found
the
reverend
gentleman
very
cooly
delivering
a
lecture
to
his
boys
on
education
it
seemed
very
strange
to
me
to
hear
a
solemn
discourse
on
the
benefits
of
early
education
when
it
seemed
to
me
starvation
was
staring
us
all
in
the
face
and
the
barren
desolation
all
around
gave
small
promise
of
the
need
of
any
education
higher
than
the
natural
impulses
of
nature
none
of
us
knew
exactly
where
we
were
nor
when
the
journey
would
be
ended
nor
when
substantial
relief
would
come
provisions
were
wasting
away
and
some
had
been
reduced
to
the
last
alternative
of
subsisting
on
the
oxen
alone
i
slept
by
the
fire
that
night
without
a
blanket
as
i
had
done
on
many
nights
before
and
after
they
hitched
up
and
drove
on
in
the
morning
i
searched
the
camp
carefully
finding
some
bacon
rinds
they
had
thrown
away
as
i
chewed
these
and
could
taste
the
rich
grease
they
contained
i
thought
they
were
the
sweetest
morsels
i
ever
tasted
here
on
the
north
side
of
the
cañon
were
some
rolling
hills
and
some
small
weak
springs
the
water
of
which
when
gathered
together
made
a
small
stream
which
ran
a
few
yards
down
the
cañon
before
it
lost
itself
in
the
rocks
and
sand
on
the
side
there
stood
what
seemed
to
be
one
half
of
a
butte
with
the
perpendicular
face
toward
the
cañon
away
on
the
summit
of
the
butte
i
saw
an
indian
so
far
away
he
looked
no
taller
than
my
finger
and
when
he
went
out
of
sight
i
knew
pretty
well
he
was
the
very
fellow
who
grew
the
squashes
i
thought
it
might
be
he
at
any
rate
i
now
turned
back
to
meet
the
teams
and
found
them
seven
or
eight
miles
up
the
cañon
and
although
it
was
a
down
grade
the
oxen
were
barely
able
to
walk
slowly
with
their
loads
which
were
light
as
wagons
were
almost
empty
except
the
women
and
children
when
night
came
on
it
seemed
to
be
cloudy
and
we
could
hear
the
cries
of
the
wild
geese
passing
east
we
regarded
this
as
a
very
good
sign
and
no
doubt
owen
lake
which
we
expected
to
pass
on
this
route
was
not
very
far
off
around
in
those
small
hills
and
damp
places
was
some
coarse
grass
and
other
growths
but
those
who
had
gone
before
devoured
the
best
so
our
oxen
had
a
hard
time
to
get
anything
to
eat
next
morning
i
shouldered
my
gun
and
followed
down
the
cañon
keeping
the
wagon
road
and
when
half
a
mile
down
at
the
sink
of
the
sickly
stream
i
killed
a
wild
goose
this
had
undoubtedly
been
attracted
here
the
night
before
by
the
light
of
our
camp
fire
when
i
got
near
the
lower
end
of
the
cañon
there
was
a
cliff
on
the
north
or
right
hand
side
which
was
perpendicular
or
perhaps
a
little
overhanging
and
at
the
base
a
cave
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
continuously
occupied
by
indians
as
i
went
on
down
i
saw
a
very
strange
looking
track
upon
the
ground
there
were
hand
and
foot
prints
as
if
a
human
being
had
crawled
upon
all
fours
as
this
track
reached
the
valley
where
the
sand
had
been
clean
swept
by
the
wind
the
tracks
became
more
plain
and
the
sand
had
been
blown
into
small
hills
not
over
three
or
four
feet
high
i
followed
the
track
till
it
led
to
the
top
of
one
of
these
small
hills
where
a
small
hole
had
been
dug
and
in
this
excavation
was
a
kind
of
indian
mummy
curled
up
like
a
dog
he
was
not
dead
for
i
could
see
him
move
as
he
breathed
but
his
skin
looked
very
much
like
the
surface
of
a
well
dried
venison
ham
i
should
think
by
his
looks
he
must
be
or
years
old
indeed
he
might
be
adam
brother
and
not
look
any
older
than
he
did
he
was
evidently
crippled
a
climate
which
would
preserve
for
many
days
or
weeks
the
carcass
of
an
ox
so
that
an
eatable
round
stake
could
be
cut
from
it
might
perhaps
preserve
a
live
man
for
a
longer
period
than
would
be
believed
i
took
a
good
long
look
at
the
wild
creature
and
during
all
the
time
he
never
moved
a
muscle
though
he
must
have
known
some
one
was
in
the
well
looking
down
at
him
he
was
probably
practicing
on
one
of
the
directions
for
a
successful
political
career
looking
wise
and
saying
nothing
at
any
rate
he
was
not
going
to
let
his
talk
get
him
into
any
trouble
he
probably
had
a
friend
around
somewhere
who
supplied
his
wants
i
now
left
him
and
went
farther
out
into
the
lowest
part
of
the
valley
i
could
look
to
the
north
for
fifty
miles
and
it
seemed
to
rise
gradually
in
that
direction
to
the
south
the
view
was
equally
extended
and
down
that
way
a
lake
could
be
seen
the
valley
was
here
quite
narrow
and
the
lofty
peak
we
had
tried
so
hard
to
reach
for
the
past
two
months
now
stood
before
me
its
east
side
was
almost
perpendicular
and
seemed
to
reach
the
sky
and
the
snow
was
drifting
over
it
while
here
the
day
sun
was
shining
uncomfortably
hot
i
believe
this
mountain
was
really
miles
from
its
base
to
its
summit
and
that
nothing
could
climb
it
on
the
eastern
side
except
a
bird
and
the
only
bird
i
had
seen
for
two
months
was
the
goose
i
shot
i
looked
every
day
for
some
sort
of
game
but
had
not
seen
any
as
i
reached
the
lower
part
of
the
valley
i
walked
over
what
seemed
to
be
boulders
of
various
sizes
and
as
i
stepped
from
one
to
another
the
tops
were
covered
with
dirt
and
they
grew
larger
as
i
went
along
i
could
see
behind
them
and
they
looked
clear
like
ice
but
on
closer
inspection
proved
to
be
immense
blocks
of
rock
salt
while
the
water
which
stood
at
their
bases
was
the
strongest
brine
after
this
discovery
i
took
my
way
back
to
the
road
made
by
the
jayhawkers
and
found
it
quite
level
but
sandy
following
this
i
came
to
a
campfire
soon
after
dark
at
which
doty
and
mess
were
camped
as
i
was
better
acquainted
i
camped
with
them
they
said
the
water
there
was
brackish
and
i
soon
found
out
the
same
thing
for
myself
it
was
a
poor
camp
no
grass
poor
water
and
scattering
bitter
sage
brush
for
food
for
the
cattle
it
would
not
do
to
wait
long
here
and
so
they
hurried
on
i
inquired
of
them
about
martin
pass
as
they
were
now
quite
near
it
and
they
said
it
was
no
pass
at
all
only
the
mountain
was
a
little
lower
than
the
one
holding
the
snow
no
wagon
could
get
over
it
and
the
party
had
made
up
their
minds
to
go
on
foot
and
were
actually
burning
their
wagons
as
fuel
with
which
to
dry
the
meat
of
some
of
the
oxen
which
they
had
killed
they
selected
those
which
were
weakest
and
least
likely
to
stand
the
journey
and
by
drying
it
the
food
was
much
concentrated
they
were
to
divide
the
provisions
equally
and
it
was
agreed
thereafter
every
one
must
lookout
for
himself
and
not
expect
any
help
from
anyone
if
he
used
up
his
own
provisions
he
had
no
right
to
expect
anyone
else
to
divide
with
him
rice
tea
and
coffee
were
measured
out
by
the
spoonful
and
the
small
amount
of
flour
and
bacon
which
remained
was
divided
out
as
evenly
as
possible
everything
was
to
be
left
behind
but
blankets
and
provisions
for
the
men
were
too
weak
to
carry
heavy
packs
and
the
oxen
could
not
be
relied
on
as
beasts
of
burden
and
it
was
thought
best
not
to
load
them
so
as
to
needlessly
break
them
down
when
these
fellows
started
out
they
were
full
of
spirit
and
the
frolic
and
fun
along
the
platte
river
was
something
worth
laughing
at
but
now
they
were
very
melancholy
and
talked
in
the
lowest
kind
of
low
spirits
one
fellow
said
he
knew
this
was
the
creator
dumping
place
where
he
had
left
the
worthless
dregs
after
making
a
world
and
the
devil
had
scraped
these
together
a
little
another
said
this
must
be
the
very
place
where
lot
wife
was
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
and
the
pillar
been
broken
up
and
spread
around
the
country
he
said
if
a
man
was
to
die
he
would
never
decay
on
account
of
the
salt
thus
the
talk
went
on
and
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
not
bad
words
enough
in
the
language
to
properly
express
their
contempt
and
bad
opinion
of
such
a
country
as
this
they
treated
me
to
some
of
their
meat
a
little
better
than
mine
and
before
daylight
in
the
morning
i
was
headed
back
on
the
trail
to
report
the
bad
news
i
had
learned
of
the
jayhawkers
about
noon
i
met
two
of
our
camp
companions
with
packs
on
their
backs
following
the
wagon
trail
and
we
stopped
and
had
a
short
talk
they
were
oldish
men
perhaps
years
old
one
a
mr
fish
of
indiana
and
another
named
gould
they
said
they
could
perhaps
do
as
well
on
foot
as
to
follow
the
slow
ox
teams
but
when
i
told
them
what
those
ahead
of
them
were
doing
and
how
they
must
go
they
did
not
seem
to
be
entirely
satisfied
as
what
they
had
on
their
backs
would
need
to
be
replenished
and
no
such
chance
could
be
expected
they
had
an
idea
that
the
end
of
the
journey
was
not
as
far
off
as
i
predicted
mr
fish
had
a
long
nicely
made
whiplash
wound
around
his
waist
and
when
i
asked
him
why
he
carried
such
a
useless
thing
which
he
could
not
eat
he
said
perhaps
he
could
trade
it
off
for
something
to
eat
after
we
had
set
on
a
sand
hill
and
talked
for
awhile
we
rose
and
shook
each
other
by
the
hand
and
bade
each
other
good
bye
with
quivering
lips
there
was
with
me
a
sort
of
expression
i
could
not
repel
that
i
should
never
see
the
middle
aged
men
again
as
my
road
was
now
out
and
away
from
the
mountains
and
level
i
had
no
fear
of
being
surprised
by
enemies
so
walked
on
with
eyes
downcast
thinking
over
the
situation
and
wondering
what
would
be
the
final
outcome
if
i
were
alone
with
no
one
to
expect
me
to
help
them
i
would
be
out
before
any
other
man
but
with
women
and
children
in
the
party
to
go
and
leave
them
would
be
to
pile
everlasting
infamy
on
my
head
the
thought
almost
made
me
crazy
but
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
stay
and
die
with
them
bravely
struggling
to
escape
than
to
forsake
them
in
their
weakness
it
was
almost
night
before
i
reached
our
camp
and
sitting
around
our
little
fire
i
told
in
the
most
easy
way
i
could
the
unfavorable
news
of
the
party
in
advance
they
seemed
to
look
to
me
as
a
guide
and
adviser
i
presume
because
i
took
much
pains
to
inform
myself
on
every
point
and
my
judgment
was
accepted
with
very
little
opposing
opinion
they
moved
as
i
thought
best
during
my
absence
from
camp
for
the
two
days
the
indians
had
shot
arrows
into
three
of
our
oxen
and
one
still
had
an
arrow
in
his
side
forward
of
the
hip
which
was
a
dangerous
place
to
be
sure
and
save
him
for
ourselves
we
killed
him
some
were
a
little
afraid
to
eat
the
meat
thinking
perhaps
the
arrow
might
be
poisoned
but
i
agreed
that
they
wanted
meat
themselves
and
would
not
do
that
i
told
them
if
they
got
a
shot
themselves
it
would
be
very
likely
to
be
a
poisoned
arrow
and
they
must
take
the
most
instant
measures
to
cut
it
out
before
it
went
into
the
blood
so
we
ventured
to
dry
the
meat
and
take
it
with
us
now
i
said
to
the
whole
camp
you
can
see
how
you
have
displeased
the
red
men
taking
their
little
squashes
and
when
we
get
into
a
place
that
suits
them
for
that
purpose
they
may
meet
us
with
a
superior
force
and
massacre
us
not
only
for
revenge
but
to
get
our
oxen
and
clothing
i
told
them
we
must
ever
be
on
guard
against
a
surprise
as
the
chances
were
greatly
against
us
we
pulled
the
arrows
out
of
the
other
oxen
and
they
seemed
to
sustain
no
great
injury
from
the
wounds
this
little
faint
stream
where
we
camped
has
since
been
named
as
furnace
creek
and
is
still
known
as
such
it
was
named
in
by
some
prospectors
who
built
what
was
called
an
air
furnace
on
a
small
scale
to
reduce
some
ore
found
near
by
which
they
supposed
to
contain
silver
but
i
believe
it
turned
out
to
be
lead
and
too
far
from
transportations
to
be
available
chapter
bennett
and
arcane
now
concluded
not
to
wait
for
me
to
go
ahead
and
explore
out
a
way
for
them
to
follow
as
i
had
done
for
a
long
time
but
to
go
ahead
as
it
was
evidently
the
best
way
to
turn
south
and
make
our
own
road
and
find
the
water
and
passes
all
for
ourselves
so
they
hitched
up
and
rolled
down
the
cañon
and
out
into
the
valley
and
then
turned
due
south
we
had
not
gone
long
on
this
course
before
we
saw
that
we
must
cross
the
valley
and
get
over
to
the
west
side
to
do
this
we
must
cross
through
some
water
and
for
fear
the
ground
might
be
miry
i
went
to
a
sand
hill
near
by
and
got
a
mesquite
stick
about
three
feet
long
with
which
to
sound
out
our
way
i
rolled
up
my
pants
pulled
off
my
moccasins
and
waded
in
having
the
teams
stand
still
till
i
could
find
out
whether
it
was
safe
for
them
to
follow
or
not
by
ascertaining
the
depth
of
the
water
and
the
character
of
the
bottom
the
water
was
very
clear
and
the
bottom
seemed
uneven
there
being
some
deep
holes
striking
my
stick
on
the
bottom
it
seemed
solid
as
a
rock
and
breaking
off
a
small
projecting
point
i
found
it
to
be
solid
rock
salt
as
the
teams
rolled
along
they
scarcely
roiled
the
water
it
looked
to
me
as
if
the
whole
valley
which
might
be
a
hundred
miles
long
might
have
been
a
solid
bed
of
rock
salt
before
we
reached
this
water
there
were
many
solid
blocks
of
salt
lying
around
covered
with
a
little
dirt
on
the
top
the
second
night
we
found
a
good
spring
of
fresh
water
coming
out
from
the
bottom
of
the
snow
peak
almost
over
our
heads
the
small
flow
from
it
spread
out
over
the
sand
and
sank
in
a
very
short
distance
and
there
was
some
quite
good
grass
growing
around
this
was
a
temporary
relief
but
brought
us
face
to
face
with
stranger
difficulties
and
a
more
hopeless
outlook
there
was
no
possible
way
to
cross
this
high
steep
range
of
mountains
anywhere
to
the
north
and
the
jayhawkers
had
abandoned
their
wagons
and
burned
them
and
we
could
no
longer
follow
on
the
trail
they
made
it
seemed
that
there
was
no
other
alternative
but
for
us
to
keep
along
the
edge
of
the
mountain
to
the
south
and
search
for
another
pass
some
who
had
read
fremont
travels
said
that
the
range
immediately
west
of
us
must
be
the
one
he
described
on
the
west
side
of
which
was
a
beautiful
country
of
rich
soil
and
having
plenty
of
cattle
and
horses
and
containing
some
settlers
but
on
the
east
all
was
barren
dry
rocky
sandy
desert
as
far
as
could
be
seen
we
knew
this
eastern
side
answered
well
the
description
and
believed
that
this
was
really
the
range
described
or
at
least
it
was
close
by
we
had
to
look
over
the
matter
very
carefully
and
consider
all
the
conditions
and
circumstances
of
the
case
we
could
see
the
mountains
were
lower
to
the
south
but
they
held
no
snow
and
seemed
only
barren
rocks
piled
up
in
lofty
peaks
and
as
we
looked
it
seemed
the
most
country
in
the
world
we
had
been
in
the
region
long
enough
to
know
the
higher
mountains
contained
most
water
and
that
the
valleys
had
bad
water
or
none
at
all
so
that
while
the
lower
altitudes
to
the
south
gave
some
promise
of
easier
crossing
it
gave
us
no
promise
of
water
or
grass
without
which
we
must
certainly
perish
in
a
certain
sense
we
were
lost
the
clear
night
and
days
furnished
us
with
the
mean
of
telling
the
points
of
compass
as
the
sun
rose
and
set
but
not
a
sign
of
life
in
nature
wide
domain
had
been
seen
for
a
month
or
more
a
vest
pocketful
of
powder
and
shot
would
last
a
good
hunter
till
he
starved
to
death
for
there
was
not
a
living
thing
to
shoot
great
or
small
we
talked
over
our
present
position
pretty
freely
and
every
one
was
asked
to
speak
his
unbiased
mind
for
we
knew
not
who
might
be
right
or
who
might
be
wrong
and
some
one
might
make
a
suggestion
of
the
utmost
value
we
all
felt
pretty
much
downhearted
our
civilized
provisions
were
getting
so
scarce
that
all
must
be
saved
for
the
women
and
children
and
the
men
must
get
along
some
way
on
ox
meat
alone
it
was
decided
not
a
scrap
of
anything
that
would
sustain
life
must
go
to
waste
the
blood
hide
and
intestines
were
all
prepared
in
some
way
for
food
this
meeting
lasted
till
late
at
night
if
some
of
them
had
lost
their
minds
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
for
hunger
swallows
all
other
feelings
a
man
in
a
starving
condition
is
a
savage
he
may
be
as
and
selfish
as
a
wild
beast
as
docile
and
gentle
as
a
lamb
or
as
wild
and
crazy
as
a
terrified
animal
devoid
of
affection
reason
or
thought
of
justice
we
were
none
of
us
as
bad
as
this
and
yet
there
was
a
strange
look
in
the
eyes
of
some
of
us
sometimes
as
i
saw
by
looking
round
and
as
others
no
doubt
realized
for
i
saw
them
making
mysterious
glances
even
in
my
direction
morning
came
and
all
were
silent
the
dim
prospect
of
the
future
seemed
to
check
every
tongue
when
one
left
a
water
hole
he
went
away
as
if
in
doubt
whether
he
would
ever
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
another
drop
every
camp
was
sad
beyond
description
and
no
one
can
guide
the
pen
to
make
it
tell
the
tale
as
it
seemed
to
us
when
our
morning
meal
of
soup
and
meat
was
finished
bennett
two
teams
and
the
two
of
arcane
concluded
their
chances
of
life
were
better
if
they
could
take
some
provisions
and
strike
out
on
foot
and
so
they
were
given
what
they
could
carry
and
they
arranged
their
packs
and
bade
us
a
sorrowful
good
bye
hoping
to
meet
again
on
the
pacific
coast
there
were
genuine
tears
shed
at
the
parting
and
i
believe
neither
party
ever
expected
to
see
each
other
in
this
life
again
bennett
two
men
were
named
silas
helmer
and
or
abbott
but
i
have
forgotten
the
names
of
arcane
men
abbott
was
from
new
york
a
harness
maker
by
trade
and
he
took
his
circular
cutting
knife
with
him
saying
it
was
light
to
carry
and
the
weapon
he
should
need
one
of
them
had
a
gun
they
took
the
trail
taken
by
the
jayhawkers
all
the
provisions
they
could
carry
besides
their
blankets
could
not
last
them
to
exceed
days
and
i
well
knew
they
could
hardly
get
off
the
desert
in
that
time
abbott
was
a
man
i
loved
fondly
he
was
good
company
in
camp
and
happy
and
sociable
he
had
shown
no
despondency
at
any
time
until
the
night
of
the
last
meeting
and
the
morning
of
the
parting
his
chances
seemed
to
me
to
be
much
poorer
than
my
own
but
i
hardly
think
he
realized
it
when
in
bed
i
could
not
keep
my
thoughts
back
from
the
old
home
i
had
left
where
good
water
and
a
bountiful
spread
were
always
ready
at
the
proper
hour
i
know
i
dreamed
of
taking
a
draft
of
cool
sweet
water
from
a
full
pitcher
and
then
woke
up
with
my
mouth
and
throat
as
dry
as
dust
the
good
home
i
left
behind
was
a
favorite
theme
about
the
campfire
and
many
a
one
told
of
the
dream
pictures
natural
as
life
that
came
to
him
of
the
happy
eastern
home
with
comfort
and
happiness
surrounding
it
even
if
wealth
was
lacking
the
home
of
the
poorest
man
on
earth
was
preferable
to
this
place
wealth
was
of
no
value
here
a
hoard
of
twenty
dollar
gold
pieces
could
now
stand
before
us
the
whole
day
long
with
no
temptation
to
touch
a
single
coin
for
its
very
weight
would
drag
us
nearer
death
we
could
purchase
nothing
with
it
and
we
would
have
cared
no
more
for
it
as
a
thing
of
value
than
we
did
the
desert
sands
we
would
have
given
much
more
for
some
of
the
snow
which
we
could
see
drifting
over
the
peak
of
the
great
snow
mountains
over
our
heads
like
a
dusty
cloud
deeming
it
best
to
spare
the
strength
as
much
as
possible
i
threw
away
everything
i
could
retaining
only
my
glass
some
ammunition
sheath
knife
and
tin
cup
no
unnecessary
burden
could
be
put
on
any
man
or
beast
lest
he
lie
down
under
it
never
to
rise
again
life
and
strength
were
sought
to
be
husbanded
in
every
possible
way
leaving
this
camp
where
the
water
was
appreciated
we
went
over
a
road
for
perhaps
miles
and
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
rocky
cañon
leading
up
west
to
the
summit
of
the
range
this
cañon
was
too
rough
for
wagons
to
pass
over
out
in
the
valley
near
its
mouth
was
a
mound
about
four
feet
high
and
in
the
top
of
this
a
little
well
that
held
about
a
pailful
of
water
that
was
quite
strong
of
sulphur
when
stirred
it
would
look
quite
black
about
the
mouth
of
the
well
was
a
wire
grass
that
seemed
to
prevent
it
caving
in
it
seems
the
drifting
sand
had
slowly
built
this
little
mound
about
the
little
well
of
water
in
a
curious
way
we
spent
the
night
here
and
kept
a
man
at
the
well
all
night
to
keep
the
water
dipped
out
as
fast
as
it
flowed
in
order
to
get
enough
for
ourselves
and
cattle
the
oxen
drank
this
water
better
than
they
did
the
brackish
water
of
the
former
camp
the
plain
was
thinly
scattered
with
sage
brush
and
up
near
the
base
of
the
mountain
some
greasewood
grew
in
little
bunches
like
currant
bushes
the
men
with
wagons
decided
they
would
take
this
cañon
and
follow
it
up
to
try
to
get
over
the
range
and
not
wait
for
me
to
go
ahead
and
explore
as
they
said
it
took
too
much
time
and
the
provisions
consisting
now
of
only
ox
meat
were
getting
more
precarious
every
day
to
help
them
all
i
could
and
if
possible
to
be
forewarned
a
little
of
danger
i
shouldered
my
gun
and
pushed
on
ahead
as
fast
as
i
could
the
bottom
was
of
sharp
broken
rock
which
would
be
very
hard
for
the
feet
of
the
oxen
although
we
had
rawhide
moccasins
for
them
for
some
time
and
this
was
the
kind
of
i
wore
myself
i
walked
on
as
rapidly
as
i
could
and
after
a
time
came
to
where
the
cañon
spread
out
into
a
kind
of
basin
enclosed
on
all
sides
but
the
entrance
with
a
wall
of
high
steep
rock
possible
to
ascend
on
foot
but
which
would
apparently
bar
the
further
progress
of
the
wagons
and
i
turned
back
utterly
disappointed
i
got
on
an
elevation
where
i
could
look
over
the
country
east
and
south
and
it
looked
as
if
there
was
not
a
drop
of
water
in
its
whole
extent
and
there
was
no
snow
on
the
dark
mountains
that
stretched
away
to
the
southward
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
difficulties
beset
me
on
every
hand
i
hurried
back
down
the
cañon
but
it
was
nearly
dark
before
i
met
the
wagons
by
a
mishap
i
fell
and
broke
the
stock
of
my
gun
over
which
i
was
very
sorry
for
it
was
an
excellent
one
the
best
i
ever
owned
i
carried
it
in
two
pieces
to
the
camp
and
told
them
the
way
was
barred
at
which
they
could
hardly
endure
their
disappointment
they
turned
in
the
morning
as
the
cattle
had
nothing
to
eat
here
and
no
water
and
not
much
of
any
food
since
leaving
the
spring
they
looked
terribly
bad
and
the
rough
road
coming
up
had
nearly
finished
them
they
were
yoked
up
and
the
wagons
turned
about
for
the
return
they
went
better
down
hill
but
it
was
not
long
before
one
of
bennett
oxen
lay
down
and
could
not
be
persuaded
to
rise
again
this
was
no
place
to
tarry
in
the
hot
sun
so
the
ox
was
killed
and
the
carcass
distributed
among
the
wagons
so
little
draft
was
required
that
the
remaining
oxen
took
the
wagon
down
when
within
two
or
three
miles
of
the
water
hole
one
of
arcane
oxen
also
failed
and
lay
down
so
they
turned
him
out
and
when
he
had
rested
a
little
he
came
on
again
for
a
while
but
soon
lay
down
again
arcane
took
a
bucket
of
water
back
from
camp
and
after
drinking
it
and
resting
awhile
the
ox
was
driven
down
to
the
spring
this
night
we
had
another
meeting
to
decide
upon
our
course
and
determine
what
to
do
at
this
meeting
no
one
was
wiser
than
another
for
no
one
had
explored
the
country
and
knew
what
to
expect
the
questions
that
now
arose
were
how
long
can
we
endure
this
work
in
this
situation
how
long
will
our
oxen
be
able
to
endure
the
great
hardship
on
the
small
nourishment
they
receive
how
long
can
we
provide
ourselves
with
food
we
had
a
few
small
pieces
of
dry
bread
this
was
kept
for
the
children
giving
them
a
little
now
and
then
our
only
food
was
in
the
flesh
of
the
oxen
and
when
they
failed
to
carry
themselves
along
we
must
begin
to
starve
it
began
to
look
as
if
the
chances
of
leaving
our
bones
to
bleach
upon
the
desert
were
the
most
prominent
ones
one
thing
was
certain
we
must
move
somewhere
at
once
if
we
stay
here
we
can
live
as
long
as
the
oxen
do
and
no
longer
and
if
we
go
on
it
is
uncertain
where
to
go
to
get
a
better
place
we
had
guns
and
ammunition
to
be
sure
but
of
late
we
had
seen
no
living
creature
in
this
desert
wild
finally
bennett
spoke
and
said
now
i
will
make
you
a
proposition
i
propose
that
we
select
two
of
our
youngest
strongest
men
and
ask
them
to
take
some
food
and
go
ahead
on
foot
to
try
to
seek
a
settlement
and
food
and
we
will
go
back
to
the
good
spring
we
have
just
left
and
wait
for
their
return
it
will
surely
not
take
them
more
than
ten
days
for
the
trip
and
when
they
get
back
we
shall
know
all
about
the
road
and
its
character
and
how
long
it
will
take
us
to
travel
it
they
can
secure
some
other
kind
of
food
that
will
make
us
feel
better
and
when
the
oxen
have
rested
a
little
at
the
spring
we
can
get
out
with
our
wagons
and
animals
and
be
safe
i
think
this
is
the
best
and
safest
way
now
what
do
you
all
say
after
a
little
discussion
all
seemed
to
agree
that
this
was
the
best
and
now
it
remained
to
find
the
men
to
go
no
one
offered
to
accept
the
position
of
advance
messengers
finally
bennett
said
he
knew
one
man
well
enough
to
know
that
he
would
come
back
if
he
lived
and
he
was
sure
he
would
push
his
way
through
i
will
take
lewis
myself
if
he
will
consent
to
go
i
consented
though
i
knew
it
was
a
hazardous
journey
exposed
to
all
sorts
of
things
indians
climate
and
probable
lack
of
water
but
i
thought
i
could
do
it
and
would
not
refuse
john
rogers
a
large
strong
tennessee
man
was
then
chosen
as
the
other
one
and
he
consented
also
now
preparations
began
arcane
killed
the
ox
which
had
so
nearly
failed
and
all
the
men
went
to
drying
and
preparing
meat
others
made
us
some
new
mocassins
out
of
rawhide
and
the
women
made
us
each
a
knapsack
our
meat
was
closely
packed
and
one
can
form
an
idea
how
poor
our
cattle
were
from
the
fact
that
john
and
i
actually
packed
of
all
the
flesh
of
an
ox
into
our
knapsacks
and
carried
it
away
they
put
in
a
couple
of
spoonfuls
of
rice
and
about
as
much
tea
this
seemed
like
robbery
to
the
children
but
the
good
women
said
that
in
case
of
sickness
even
that
little
bit
might
save
our
lives
i
wore
no
coat
or
vest
but
took
half
of
a
light
blanket
while
rogers
wore
a
thin
summer
coat
and
took
no
blanket
we
each
had
a
small
tin
cup
and
a
small
camp
kettle
holding
a
quart
bennett
had
me
take
his
rifle
and
rogers
had
a
good
double
barreled
shot
gun
we
each
had
a
sheath
knife
and
our
hats
were
small
brimmed
drab
affairs
fitting
close
to
the
head
and
not
very
conspicuous
to
an
enemy
as
we
might
rise
up
from
behind
a
hill
into
possible
views
we
tried
on
our
packs
and
fitted
the
straps
a
little
so
they
would
carry
easy
they
collected
all
the
money
there
was
in
camp
and
gave
it
to
us
arcane
had
about
and
others
threw
in
small
amounts
from
forty
cents
upward
we
received
all
sorts
of
advice
capt
culverwell
was
an
old
sea
faring
man
and
was
going
to
tell
us
how
to
find
our
way
back
but
bennett
told
the
captain
that
he
had
known
lewis
as
a
hunter
for
many
years
and
that
if
he
went
over
a
place
in
the
daytime
he
could
find
his
way
back
at
night
every
time
others
cautioned
us
about
the
indians
and
told
us
how
to
manage
others
told
us
not
to
get
caught
in
deep
snow
which
we
might
find
on
the
mountains
this
advice
we
received
in
all
the
kindness
in
which
it
was
given
and
then
we
bade
them
all
good
bye
some
turned
away
too
much
affected
to
approach
us
and
others
shook
our
hands
with
deep
feeling
grasping
them
firmly
and
heartily
hoping
we
would
be
successful
and
be
able
to
pilot
them
out
of
this
dreary
place
into
a
better
land
every
one
felt
that
a
little
food
to
make
a
change
from
the
poor
dried
meat
would
be
acceptable
and
bennett
and
arcane
and
wife
were
the
last
to
remain
when
the
others
had
turned
away
they
had
most
faith
in
the
plan
and
felt
deeply
bennett
was
the
last
and
she
asked
god
to
bless
us
and
bring
some
food
to
her
starving
children
we
were
so
much
affected
that
we
could
not
speak
and
silently
turned
away
and
took
our
course
again
up
the
canyon
we
had
descended
the
night
before
after
a
while
we
looked
back
and
when
they
saw
us
turn
around
all
the
hats
and
bonnets
waved
us
a
final
parting
those
left
in
the
camp
were
asabel
bennett
and
sarah
his
wife
with
three
children
george
melissa
and
martha
arcane
and
wife
with
son
charles
the
youngest
children
were
not
more
than
two
years
old
there
were
also
the
two
earhart
brothers
and
a
grown
son
capt
culverwell
and
some
others
i
can
not
recall
eleven
grown
people
in
all
besides
a
wade
his
wife
and
three
children
who
did
not
mingle
with
our
party
but
usually
camped
a
little
distance
off
followed
our
trail
but
seemed
to
shun
company
we
soon
passed
round
a
bend
of
the
cañon
and
then
walked
on
in
silence
we
both
of
us
meditated
some
over
the
homes
of
our
fathers
but
took
new
courage
in
view
of
the
importance
of
our
mission
and
passed
on
as
fast
as
we
could
by
night
we
were
far
up
the
mountain
near
the
perpendicular
rough
peak
and
far
above
us
on
a
slope
we
could
see
some
bunches
of
grass
and
sage
brush
we
went
to
this
and
found
some
small
water
holes
no
water
ran
from
them
they
were
so
small
here
we
staid
all
night
it
did
not
seem
very
far
to
the
snowy
peak
to
the
north
of
us
just
where
we
were
seemed
the
lowest
pass
for
to
the
south
were
higher
peaks
and
the
rocks
looked
as
if
they
were
too
steep
to
be
got
over
through
this
gap
came
a
cold
breeze
and
we
had
to
look
round
to
get
a
sheltered
place
in
which
to
sleep
we
lay
down
close
together
spoon
fashion
and
made
the
little
blanket
do
as
cover
for
the
both
of
us
in
the
morning
we
filled
our
canteens
which
we
had
made
by
binding
two
powder
cans
together
with
strips
of
cloth
and
started
for
the
summit
near
by
from
this
was
the
grandest
sight
we
ever
beheld
looking
east
we
could
see
the
country
we
had
been
crawling
over
since
november
just
look
at
the
cursed
country
we
have
come
over
said
rogers
as
he
pointed
over
it
to
the
north
was
the
biggest
mountain
we
ever
saw
peaks
on
peaks
and
towering
far
above
our
heads
and
covered
with
snow
which
was
apparently
everlasting
this
mountain
seemed
to
have
very
few
trees
on
it
and
in
extent
as
it
reached
away
to
the
north
seemed
interminable
south
was
a
nearly
level
plain
and
to
the
west
i
thought
i
could
dimly
see
a
range
of
mountains
that
held
a
little
snow
upon
their
summits
but
on
the
main
range
to
the
south
there
was
none
it
seemed
to
me
the
dim
snowy
mountains
must
be
as
far
as
miles
away
but
of
course
i
could
not
judge
accurately
after
looking
at
this
grand
but
worthless
landscape
long
enough
to
take
in
its
principal
features
we
asked
each
other
what
we
supposed
the
people
we
left
behind
would
think
to
see
mountains
so
far
ahead
we
knew
that
they
had
an
idea
that
the
coast
range
was
not
very
far
ahead
but
we
saw
at
once
to
go
over
all
these
mountains
and
return
within
the
limits
of
fifteen
days
which
had
been
agreed
upon
between
us
would
probably
be
impossible
but
we
must
try
as
best
we
could
so
down
the
rocky
steep
we
clambered
and
hurried
on
our
way
in
places
the
way
was
so
steep
that
we
had
to
help
each
other
down
and
the
hard
work
made
us
perspire
freely
so
that
the
water
was
a
prime
necessity
in
one
place
near
here
we
found
a
little
water
and
filled
our
canteens
besides
drinking
a
good
present
supply
there
were
two
low
black
rocky
ranges
directly
ahead
of
us
which
we
must
cross
when
part
way
down
the
mountain
a
valley
or
depression
opened
up
in
that
direction
up
which
it
seemed
as
if
we
could
look
a
hundred
miles
near
by
and
a
short
distance
north
was
a
lake
of
water
and
when
we
reached
the
valley
we
crossed
a
clear
stream
of
water
flowing
slowly
toward
the
lake
being
in
need
of
water
we
rushed
eagerly
to
it
and
prepared
to
take
a
big
drink
but
the
tempting
fluid
was
as
salt
as
brine
and
made
our
thirst
all
the
more
intolerable
nothing
grew
on
the
bank
of
this
stream
and
the
bed
was
of
hard
clay
which
glistened
in
the
sun
we
now
began
the
ascent
of
the
next
ridge
keeping
a
westernly
course
and
walked
as
fast
as
we
could
up
the
rough
mountain
side
we
crossed
the
head
of
a
cañon
near
the
summit
about
dark
and
here
we
found
a
trail
which
from
indications
we
knew
to
be
that
of
the
jayhawkers
who
had
evidently
been
forced
to
the
southward
of
the
course
they
intended
to
take
they
had
camped
here
and
had
dug
holes
in
the
sand
in
search
of
water
but
had
found
none
we
staid
all
night
here
and
dug
around
in
some
other
places
in
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
in
the
hope
to
have
better
luck
than
they
did
but
we
got
no
water
anywhere
we
seemed
almost
perishing
for
want
of
water
the
hard
exercise
made
us
perspire
so
freely
in
the
morning
we
started
on
and
near
the
summit
we
came
to
the
dead
body
of
mr
fish
laying
in
the
hot
sun
as
there
was
no
material
near
here
with
which
his
friends
could
cover
the
remains
this
mr
fish
was
the
man
who
left
camp
some
two
weeks
before
in
company
with
another
and
who
carried
the
long
whiplash
wound
about
his
body
in
hope
he
could
somewhere
be
able
to
trade
it
for
bread
no
doubt
in
this
very
place
where
he
breathed
his
last
his
bones
still
lie
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
next
valley
we
could
see
a
lake
of
water
some
distance
south
of
our
western
course
we
had
followed
the
jayhawkers
trail
thus
far
but
as
we
found
no
water
in
small
holes
in
the
rocks
as
we
were
likely
to
do
when
we
were
the
first
to
pass
we
decided
to
take
a
new
route
in
the
hope
to
find
a
little
water
in
this
way
for
we
had
no
hope
of
finding
it
in
any
other
this
valley
we
now
crossed
seemed
to
come
to
an
end
about
ten
miles
to
the
north
of
us
to
the
south
it
widened
out
enclosing
the
lake
spoken
of
this
valley
was
very
sandy
and
hard
to
walk
over
when
about
halfway
across
we
saw
some
ox
tracks
leading
toward
the
lake
and
in
the
hope
we
might
find
the
water
drinkable
we
turned
off
at
right
angles
to
our
course
and
went
that
way
also
long
before
we
reached
the
water
of
the
lake
the
bottom
became
a
thin
slimy
mud
which
was
very
hard
on
our
mocassins
when
we
reached
the
water
we
found
it
to
be
of
a
wine
color
and
so
strongly
alkaline
as
to
feel
slippery
to
the
touch
and
under
our
feet
this
side
trip
had
cost
us
much
exertion
and
made
us
feel
more
thirsty
than
ever
we
turned
now
west
again
making
for
a
cañon
up
which
we
passed
in
the
hope
we
should
at
some
turn
find
a
little
basin
of
rain
water
in
some
rock
we
traveled
in
it
miles
and
miles
and
our
mouths
became
so
dry
we
had
to
put
a
bullet
or
a
small
smooth
stone
in
and
chew
it
and
turn
it
around
with
the
tongue
to
induce
a
flow
of
saliva
if
we
saw
a
spear
of
green
grass
on
the
north
side
of
a
rock
it
was
quickly
pulled
and
eaten
to
obtain
the
little
moisture
it
contained
thus
we
traveled
along
for
hours
never
speaking
for
we
found
it
much
better
for
our
thirst
to
keep
our
mouths
closed
as
much
as
possible
and
prevent
the
evaporation
the
dry
air
of
that
region
took
up
water
as
a
sponge
does
we
passed
the
summit
of
this
ridge
without
finding
any
water
and
on
our
way
down
the
western
side
we
came
to
a
flat
place
where
there
was
an
indian
hut
made
of
small
brush
we
now
thought
there
surely
must
be
some
water
near
and
we
began
a
thorough
search
the
great
snow
mountain
did
not
seem
far
off
but
to
the
south
and
southwest
a
level
or
inclined
plain
extended
for
a
long
distance
our
thirst
began
to
be
something
terrible
to
endure
and
in
the
warm
weather
and
hard
walking
we
had
secured
only
two
drinks
since
leaving
camp
we
were
so
sure
that
there
must
be
water
near
here
that
we
laid
our
knapsacks
down
by
the
little
hut
and
looked
around
in
every
possible
place
we
could
think
of
soon
it
got
dark
and
then
we
made
a
little
fire
as
a
guide
and
looked
again
soon
the
moon
arose
and
helped
us
some
and
we
shouted
frequently
to
each
other
so
as
not
to
get
lost
we
were
so
nearly
worn
out
that
we
tried
to
eat
a
little
meat
but
after
chewing
a
long
time
the
mouth
would
not
moisten
it
enough
so
we
could
swallow
and
we
had
to
reject
it
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
going
to
die
with
plenty
of
food
in
our
hand
because
we
could
not
eat
it
we
tried
to
sleep
but
could
not
but
after
a
little
rest
we
noticed
a
bright
star
two
hours
above
the
horizon
and
from
the
course
of
the
moon
we
saw
the
star
must
be
pretty
truly
west
of
us
we
talked
a
little
and
the
burden
of
it
was
a
fear
that
we
could
not
endure
the
terrible
thirst
a
while
longer
the
thought
of
the
women
and
children
waiting
for
our
return
made
us
feel
more
desperate
than
if
we
were
the
only
ones
concerned
we
thought
we
could
fight
to
the
death
over
a
water
hole
if
we
could
only
secure
a
little
of
the
precious
fluid
no
one
who
has
ever
felt
the
extreme
of
thirst
can
imagine
the
distress
the
dispair
which
it
brings
i
can
find
no
words
no
way
to
express
it
so
others
can
understand
the
moon
gave
us
so
much
light
that
we
decided
we
would
start
on
our
course
and
get
as
far
as
we
could
before
the
hot
sun
came
out
and
so
we
went
on
slowly
and
carefully
in
the
partial
darkness
the
only
hope
left
to
us
being
that
our
strength
would
hold
out
till
we
could
get
to
the
shining
snow
on
the
great
mountain
before
us
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
range
we
were
descending
about
sunrise
there
was
here
a
wide
wash
from
the
snow
mountain
down
which
some
water
had
sometime
run
after
a
big
storm
and
had
divided
into
little
rivulets
only
reaching
out
a
little
way
before
they
had
sunk
into
the
sand
we
had
no
idea
we
could
now
find
any
water
till
we
at
least
got
very
near
the
snow
and
as
the
best
way
to
reach
it
we
turned
up
the
wash
although
the
course
was
nearly
to
the
north
the
course
was
up
a
gentle
grade
and
seemed
quite
sandy
and
not
easy
to
travel
it
looked
as
if
there
was
an
all
day
walk
before
us
and
it
was
quite
a
question
if
we
could
live
long
enough
to
make
the
distance
there
were
quite
strong
indications
that
the
water
had
run
here
not
so
very
long
ago
and
we
could
trace
the
course
of
the
little
streams
round
among
little
sandy
islands
a
little
stunted
brush
grew
here
but
it
was
so
brittle
that
the
stems
would
break
as
easy
as
an
icicle
in
order
to
not
miss
a
possible
bit
of
water
we
separated
and
agreed
upon
a
general
course
and
that
if
either
one
found
water
he
should
fire
his
gun
as
a
signal
after
about
a
mile
or
so
had
been
gone
over
i
heard
roger
gun
and
went
in
his
direction
he
had
found
a
little
ice
that
had
frozen
under
the
clear
sky
it
was
not
thicker
than
window
glass
after
putting
a
piece
in
our
mouths
we
gathered
all
we
could
and
put
it
into
the
little
quart
camp
kettle
to
melt
we
gathered
just
a
kettle
full
besides
what
we
ate
as
we
were
gathering
and
kindled
a
little
fire
and
melted
it
i
can
but
think
how
providential
it
was
that
we
started
in
the
night
for
in
an
hour
after
the
sun
had
risen
that
little
sheet
of
ice
would
have
melted
and
the
water
sank
into
the
sand
having
quenched
our
thirst
we
could
now
eat
and
found
that
we
were
nearly
starved
also
in
making
this
meal
we
used
up
all
our
little
store
of
water
but
we
felt
refreshed
and
our
lives
renewed
so
that
we
had
better
courage
to
go
on
we
now
took
our
course
west
again
taking
a
bee
line
for
a
bluff
that
lay
a
little
to
the
south
of
the
big
snow
mountain
on
and
on
we
walked
till
the
dark
shadow
of
the
great
mountain
in
the
setting
sun
was
thrown
about
us
and
still
we
did
not
seem
more
than
half
way
to
the
bluff
before
us
all
the
way
had
been
hill
and
very
tiresome
walking
there
was
considerable
small
brush
scattered
about
here
and
there
over
this
steeply
inclined
plain
we
were
still
several
miles
from
the
base
of
this
largest
of
the
mountains
and
we
could
now
see
that
it
extended
west
for
many
miles
the
buttes
to
the
south
were
low
black
and
barren
and
to
the
west
as
far
as
we
could
see
there
were
no
mountains
with
any
snow
as
the
sun
got
further
down
we
could
see
a
small
smoke
curling
up
near
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
we
thought
it
must
be
some
signal
made
by
the
indians
as
we
had
often
seen
them
signal
in
that
way
but
we
stopped
and
talked
the
matter
over
and
as
we
were
yet
a
long
way
from
the
bluff
which
had
been
our
objective
point
we
concluded
we
would
investigate
the
smoke
signal
a
little
closer
so
we
set
off
toward
it
in
the
dusk
and
darkness
and
when
within
about
a
mile
we
found
we
were
in
a
tract
that
had
been
somewhat
beaten
feeling
with
my
fingers
i
was
quite
sure
i
could
distinguish
ox
tracks
and
then
was
quite
sure
that
we
had
overtaken
the
jayhawkers
or
at
least
were
on
their
trail
and
then
i
thought
perhaps
they
had
fallen
among
the
indians
who
now
might
be
feasting
on
their
oxen
and
it
became
necessary
to
use
great
caution
in
approaching
the
little
smoke
we
took
a
circuitous
route
and
soon
saw
that
the
persons
were
on
a
little
bench
above
us
and
we
kept
very
cautious
and
quiet
listening
for
any
sounds
that
might
tell
us
who
they
were
if
they
were
indians
we
should
probably
hear
some
of
their
dogs
but
we
heard
none
and
kept
creeping
closer
and
closer
till
we
were
within
fifty
yards
without
hearing
a
sound
to
give
us
any
idea
of
who
they
were
we
decided
to
get
our
guns
at
full
cock
and
then
hail
the
camp
feeling
that
we
had
a
little
the
advantage
of
position
we
hailed
and
were
answered
in
english
do
shoot
said
we
and
they
assured
us
they
had
no
idea
of
such
a
thing
and
asked
us
to
come
in
we
found
here
to
our
surprise
ed
doty
tom
shannon
stevens
and
others
whom
i
do
not
recollect
the
real
jayhawkers
they
gave
us
some
fresh
meat
for
supper
and
near
the
camp
were
some
water
holes
that
answered
well
for
camp
purposes
here
an
ox
had
given
out
and
they
had
stopped
long
enough
to
dry
the
meat
while
the
others
had
gone
on
a
day
ahead
coming
around
the
mountain
from
the
north
was
quite
a
well
defined
trail
leading
to
the
west
and
they
said
they
were
satisfied
some
one
lived
at
the
end
of
it
and
they
were
going
to
follow
it
if
it
lead
to
mexico
or
anywhere
else
they
said
that
brier
and
his
family
were
still
on
behind
and
alone
every
one
must
look
out
for
himself
here
and
we
could
not
do
much
for
another
in
any
way
we
inquired
of
them
about
the
trail
over
which
they
had
come
and
where
they
had
found
water
and
we
told
them
of
our
experience
in
this
respect
we
then
related
how
our
train
could
not
go
over
the
mountains
with
wagons
how
they
had
returned
to
the
best
spring
and
that
we
started
to
go
through
to
the
settlements
to
obtain
relief
while
they
waited
for
our
return
we
explained
to
them
how
they
must
perish
without
assistance
if
we
failed
to
get
through
they
could
probably
live
as
long
as
the
oxen
lasted
and
would
then
perish
of
starvation
we
told
them
how
nearly
we
came
to
the
point
of
perishing
that
very
morning
of
thirst
and
how
we
were
saved
by
finding
a
little
patch
of
ice
in
an
unexpected
place
and
were
thus
enabled
to
come
on
another
days
travel
these
men
were
not
as
cheerful
as
they
used
to
be
and
their
situation
and
prospects
constantly
occupied
their
minds
they
said
to
us
that
if
the
present
trail
bore
away
from
the
mountain
and
crossed
the
level
plain
that
there
were
some
of
them
who
could
not
possibly
get
along
safely
to
the
other
side
some
were
completely
discouraged
and
some
were
completely
out
of
provisions
and
dependent
on
those
who
had
either
provisions
or
oxen
yet
on
hand
an
ox
was
frequently
killed
they
said
and
no
part
of
it
was
wasted
at
a
camp
where
there
was
no
water
for
stewing
a
piece
or
hide
would
be
prepared
for
eating
by
singeing
off
the
hair
and
then
roasting
in
the
fire
the
small
intestines
were
drawn
through
the
fingers
to
clean
them
and
these
when
roasted
made
very
fair
food
they
said
they
had
been
without
water
for
four
or
five
days
at
a
time
and
came
near
starving
to
death
for
it
was
impossible
to
swallow
food
when
one
became
so
thirsty
they
described
the
pangs
of
hunger
as
something
terrible
and
not
to
be
described
they
were
willing
to
give
us
any
information
we
desired
and
we
anxiously
received
all
we
could
for
on
our
return
we
desired
to
take
the
best
possible
route
and
we
thus
had
the
experience
of
two
parties
instead
of
one
they
told
us
about
the
death
of
mr
fish
and
isham
and
where
we
would
find
their
bodies
if
we
went
over
their
trail
in
the
morning
we
shouldered
our
packs
again
and
took
the
trail
leading
to
the
west
and
by
night
we
had
overtaken
the
advance
party
of
the
jayhawkers
camped
in
a
cañon
where
there
was
a
little
water
barely
sufficient
for
their
use
we
inquired
why
they
did
not
take
the
trail
leading
more
directly
west
at
the
forks
and
they
said
they
feared
it
would
lead
them
into
deep
snow
which
would
be
impassible
they
said
they
considered
the
trail
they
had
taken
as
altogether
the
safest
one
we
met
bennett
and
arcane
teamsters
and
as
we
expected
they
were
already
out
of
grub
and
no
way
to
get
anymore
when
the
party
killed
an
ox
they
had
humbly
begged
for
some
of
the
poorest
parts
and
thus
far
were
alive
they
came
to
us
and
very
pitifully
told
us
they
were
entirely
out
and
although
an
ox
had
been
killed
that
day
they
had
not
been
able
to
get
a
mouthful
we
divided
up
our
meat
and
gave
them
some
although
we
did
not
know
how
long
it
would
be
before
we
would
ourselves
be
in
the
same
situation
thus
far
we
had
not
seen
anything
to
shoot
big
or
little
although
we
kept
a
sharp
lookout
the
whole
camp
was
silent
and
all
seemed
to
realize
their
situation
before
them
was
a
level
plain
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
so
broad
as
to
take
five
or
six
days
to
cross
judging
by
the
look
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
as
we
came
over
there
was
little
to
hope
for
in
the
way
of
water
we
thought
it
over
very
seriously
all
the
water
we
could
carry
would
be
our
canteens
full
perhaps
two
drinks
apiece
and
the
poor
meat
had
so
little
nourishment
that
we
were
weak
and
unable
to
endure
what
we
once
could
we
were
alone
rogers
and
i
in
interest
at
any
rate
even
if
there
were
other
men
about
for
the
time
it
really
seemed
as
if
there
was
very
little
hope
for
us
and
i
have
often
repeated
the
following
lines
as
very
closely
describing
my
own
feelings
at
that
time
oh
hands
whose
loving
gentle
grasp
i
loosed
when
first
this
weary
journey
was
begun
if
i
could
feel
your
touch
as
once
i
could
how
gladly
would
i
wish
my
work
undone
during
the
evening
i
had
a
talk
with
capt
asa
haines
in
which
he
said
he
left
a
good
home
in
illinois
where
he
had
everything
he
could
wish
to
eat
and
every
necessary
comfort
and
even
some
to
spare
and
now
he
felt
so
nearly
worn
out
that
he
had
many
doubts
whether
he
could
live
to
reach
the
mountains
on
the
other
side
he
was
so
deeply
impressed
that
he
made
me
promise
to
let
his
wife
and
family
know
how
i
found
him
and
how
he
died
for
he
felt
sure
he
would
never
see
the
california
mines
i
said
i
might
not
get
through
myself
but
he
thought
we
were
so
young
and
strong
that
we
would
struggle
through
he
said
if
he
could
only
be
home
once
more
he
would
be
content
to
stay
this
was
the
general
tenor
of
the
conversation
there
was
no
mirth
no
jokes
and
every
one
seemed
to
feel
that
he
was
very
near
the
end
of
his
life
and
such
a
death
as
stood
before
them
choking
starving
in
a
desert
was
the
most
dreary
outlook
i
ever
saw
this
camp
of
trouble
of
forlorn
hope
on
the
edge
of
a
desert
stretching
out
before
us
like
a
small
sea
with
no
hope
for
relief
except
at
the
end
of
a
struggle
which
seemed
almost
hopeless
is
more
than
any
pen
can
paint
or
at
all
describe
the
writer
had
tried
it
often
picture
to
yourself
dear
reader
the
situation
and
let
your
own
imagination
do
the
rest
it
can
never
come
up
to
the
reality
in
the
morning
as
rogers
and
i
were
about
to
start
several
of
the
oldest
men
came
to
us
with
their
addresses
and
wished
us
to
forward
them
to
their
families
if
we
ever
got
within
the
reach
of
mails
these
men
shed
tears
and
we
did
also
as
we
parted
we
turned
silently
away
and
again
took
up
our
march
as
we
went
down
the
cañon
we
came
to
one
place
where
it
was
so
narrow
that
a
man
or
a
poor
ox
could
barely
squeeze
through
between
the
rocks
and
in
a
few
miles
more
reached
the
open
level
plain
when
three
or
four
miles
out
on
the
trail
and
not
far
from
the
hills
we
came
to
a
bunch
of
quite
tall
willows
the
center
of
the
bunch
had
been
cut
out
and
the
branches
woven
in
so
as
to
make
a
sort
of
corral
in
the
center
of
this
was
a
spring
of
good
water
and
some
good
grass
growing
around
this
was
pretty
good
evidence
that
some
one
had
been
here
before
we
took
a
good
drink
and
filled
our
canteens
anew
for
we
did
not
expect
to
get
another
drink
for
two
or
three
days
at
least
we
took
the
trail
again
and
hurried
on
as
the
good
water
made
us
feel
quite
fresh
after
a
few
miles
we
began
to
find
the
bones
of
animals
some
badly
decayed
and
some
well
preserved
all
the
heads
were
those
of
horses
and
it
puzzled
us
to
know
where
they
came
from
as
we
passed
along
we
noticed
the
trail
was
on
a
slight
up
grade
and
somewhat
crooked
if
we
stepped
off
from
it
the
foot
sank
in
about
two
inches
in
dirt
finer
than
the
finest
flour
the
bones
were
scattered
all
along
sometimes
the
bones
of
several
animals
together
was
it
the
long
drive
poison
water
or
what
it
was
evident
they
had
not
been
killed
but
had
dropped
along
the
way
it
was
a
dreary
trail
at
best
and
these
evidences
of
death
did
not
help
to
brighten
it
in
the
least
we
wondered
often
where
it
led
to
and
what
new
things
would
be
our
experience
after
walking
fast
all
day
we
came
to
quite
an
elevation
where
we
could
stand
and
look
in
all
directions
the
low
black
range
where
we
left
the
jayhawkers
was
in
sight
and
this
spur
of
the
great
snowy
mountains
extended
a
long
way
to
the
south
and
seemed
to
get
lower
and
lower
finally
ending
in
low
rocky
buttes
a
hundred
miles
away
some
may
think
this
distance
very
far
to
see
but
those
who
have
ever
seen
the
clear
atmosphere
of
that
region
will
bear
me
out
in
these
magnificent
distances
generally
a
mountain
or
other
object
seen
at
a
distance
would
be
three
or
four
times
as
far
off
as
one
would
judge
at
first
sight
so
deceptive
are
appearances
there
the
broad
south
end
of
the
great
mountain
which
we
first
saw
the
next
morning
after
we
left
the
wagons
was
now
plain
in
sight
and
peak
after
peak
extending
away
to
the
north
all
of
them
white
with
snow
standing
thus
out
in
the
plain
we
could
see
the
breadth
of
the
mountain
east
and
west
and
it
seemed
as
though
it
must
have
been
nearly
a
hundred
miles
the
south
end
was
very
abrupt
and
sank
as
one
into
a
great
plain
in
which
we
stood
twenty
miles
from
the
mountain
base
to
the
northwest
we
could
see
a
clay
lake
or
at
least
that
was
what
we
called
it
and
a
line
of
low
hills
seemed
to
be
an
extension
of
the
mountain
in
a
direction
swinging
around
to
the
south
to
enclose
this
thirsty
barren
plain
before
us
which
was
bounded
by
mountains
or
hills
on
these
sides
to
the
south
this
range
seemed
to
get
higher
and
we
could
see
some
snow
capped
mountains
to
the
south
of
our
westerly
course
the
low
mountains
as
those
seen
in
the
northwest
direction
is
the
same
place
now
crossed
by
the
southern
pacific
railroad
and
known
as
the
tehachipi
pass
the
noted
loop
in
which
the
railroad
crosses
itself
being
on
the
west
slope
and
tejon
being
on
the
same
range
a
little
further
south
where
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
and
the
coast
range
join
the
first
mountain
bearing
snow
south
of
our
course
was
probably
what
is
known
as
wilson
peak
and
the
high
mountains
still
farther
south
the
san
bernardino
mountains
there
were
no
names
there
known
to
us
nor
did
we
know
anything
of
the
topography
of
the
country
except
that
we
supposed
a
range
of
mountains
was
all
that
separated
us
from
california
we
were
yet
in
the
desert
and
if
we
kept
our
due
west
course
we
must
cross
some
of
the
snow
before
us
which
if
steep
gave
us
some
doubts
whether
we
could
get
through
or
not
we
did
not
know
exactly
what
the
people
left
behind
would
do
if
we
were
gone
longer
than
we
intended
but
if
they
started
on
it
was
quite
plain
to
us
they
would
be
lost
and
as
seven
days
had
already
passed
we
were
in
serious
trouble
for
fear
we
could
not
complete
the
trip
in
the
time
allotted
to
us
we
surveyed
the
plain
and
mountains
to
learn
its
situation
and
then
started
on
following
our
trail
as
we
went
on
we
seemed
to
be
coming
to
lower
ground
and
near
our
road
stood
a
tree
of
a
kind
we
had
not
seen
before
the
trunk
was
about
six
or
eight
inches
through
and
six
or
eight
feet
high
with
arms
at
the
top
quite
as
large
as
the
body
and
at
the
end
of
the
arms
a
bunch
of
long
stiff
bayonet
shaped
leaves
it
was
a
brave
little
tree
to
live
in
such
a
barren
country
as
we
walked
on
these
trees
were
more
plenty
and
some
were
much
larger
than
the
first
as
we
came
to
the
lowest
part
of
the
valley
there
seemed
to
be
little
faint
water
ways
running
around
little
clouds
of
stunted
shrubs
but
there
was
no
signs
that
very
much
water
ever
run
in
them
we
thought
that
these
were
the
outlet
of
the
big
sandy
lake
which
might
get
full
of
water
and
overflow
through
these
channels
after
some
great
storm
as
this
low
ground
was
quite
wide
we
lost
our
trail
in
crossing
it
and
we
separated
as
we
went
along
looking
to
find
it
again
till
nearly
dark
when
we
looked
for
a
camping
place
fortunately
we
found
a
little
pond
of
rain
water
and
some
of
our
strange
trees
that
were
dead
gave
us
good
material
for
a
fire
so
that
we
were
very
comfortable
indeed
having
both
drink
and
fire
starting
on
again
our
course
was
now
ascending
slightly
and
we
came
across
more
and
more
of
the
trees
and
larger
ones
than
at
first
we
saw
some
that
seemed
to
have
broken
down
with
their
own
weight
the
bayonet
shaped
leaves
seemed
to
fall
off
when
old
and
the
stalk
looked
so
much
like
an
old
overgrown
cabbage
stump
that
we
name
them
cabbage
trees
but
afterward
learned
they
were
a
species
of
yucca
we
were
much
worried
at
loosing
our
trail
and
felt
that
it
would
be
quite
unsafe
to
try
to
cross
the
mountain
without
finding
it
again
so
we
separated
rogers
going
northwest
and
i
southwest
agreeing
to
swing
round
so
as
to
meet
again
about
noon
but
when
we
met
neither
of
us
had
found
a
trail
and
we
were
still
about
miles
from
the
foothills
rogers
said
he
had
heard
some
of
the
people
say
that
the
trail
leading
from
salt
lake
to
los
angeles
crossed
such
a
mountain
in
a
low
pass
with
very
high
mountains
on
each
side
and
he
supposed
that
the
high
mountain
to
the
south
must
be
the
one
where
the
trail
crossed
but
as
this
would
take
us
fully
fifty
miles
south
of
our
course
as
we
supposed
it
was
we
hesitated
about
going
there
and
concluded
we
would
try
the
lowest
place
in
the
mountain
first
and
if
we
failed
we
could
then
go
and
try
roger
route
more
to
the
south
so
we
pushed
on
still
keeping
a
distance
apart
to
look
out
for
the
trail
and
before
night
in
the
rolling
hills
we
saw
here
and
there
faint
traces
of
it
which
grew
plainer
as
we
went
along
and
about
sundown
we
reached
some
water
holes
and
from
some
old
skulls
of
oxen
lying
around
the
ground
showing
that
it
had
at
some
previous
time
been
a
camping
ground
we
found
some
good
large
sage
brush
which
made
a
pretty
good
fire
and
if
we
could
have
had
a
little
fresh
meat
to
roast
we
thought
we
were
in
a
good
position
for
supper
but
that
poor
meat
was
pretty
dry
food
however
it
kept
us
alive
and
we
curled
up
together
and
slept
for
the
night
was
cool
and
we
had
to
make
the
little
blanket
do
its
best
we
thought
we
ought
to
find
a
little
game
but
we
had
not
seen
any
to
shoot
since
we
started
in
the
morning
the
trail
led
us
toward
the
snow
and
as
we
went
along
a
brave
old
crow
surprised
us
by
lighting
on
a
bush
near
the
trail
and
we
surprised
him
by
killing
him
with
a
charge
of
shot
here
your
fresh
meat
said
rogers
as
he
put
it
into
his
knapsack
to
cook
for
supper
and
marched
on
as
we
approached
the
summit
we
could
see
on
the
high
mountains
south
of
us
some
trees
and
when
we
came
near
the
highest
part
of
our
road
there
were
some
juniper
trees
near
it
which
was
very
encouraging
we
crossed
over
several
miles
of
hard
snow
but
it
moistened
up
our
moccassins
and
made
them
soft
and
uncomfortable
after
we
had
turned
down
the
western
slope
we
killed
a
small
hawk
your
meat
said
i
as
the
poor
thin
fellow
was
stowed
away
for
future
grub
to
cook
with
the
crow
when
we
got
out
of
the
snow
we
had
lost
the
trail
again
but
the
hills
on
the
sides
were
covered
with
large
brush
and
on
a
higher
part
of
the
mountain
south
were
some
big
trees
and
we
began
to
think
the
country
would
change
for
the
better
pretty
soon
we
followed
down
the
ravine
for
many
miles
and
when
this
came
out
into
a
larger
one
we
were
greatly
pleased
at
the
prospect
for
down
the
latter
came
a
beautiful
little
running
brook
of
clear
pure
water
singing
as
it
danced
over
the
stones
a
happy
song
and
telling
us
to
drink
and
drink
again
and
you
may
be
sure
we
did
drink
for
it
had
been
months
and
months
since
we
had
had
such
water
pure
sweet
free
from
the
terrible
alkali
and
stagnant
taste
that
had
been
in
almost
every
drop
we
had
seen
rogers
leveled
his
shot
gun
at
some
birds
and
killed
a
beautiful
one
with
a
top
knot
on
his
head
and
colors
bright
all
down
his
neck
it
was
a
california
quail
we
said
birds
always
lived
where
human
beings
did
and
we
had
great
hopes
born
to
us
of
a
better
land
i
told
john
that
if
the
folks
were
only
there
now
i
could
kill
game
enough
for
them
we
dressed
our
three
birds
and
got
them
boiling
in
the
camp
kettle
and
while
they
were
cooking
talked
over
the
outlook
which
was
so
flattering
that
our
tongues
got
loose
and
we
rattled
away
in
strange
contrast
to
the
ominous
silence
of
a
week
ago
while
eating
our
stew
of
crow
and
hawk
we
could
see
willows
alders
and
big
sage
brush
around
and
we
had
noticed
what
seemed
to
be
cottonwoods
farther
down
the
cañon
and
green
trees
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
we
were
sure
we
were
on
the
edge
of
the
promised
land
and
were
quite
light
hearted
till
we
began
to
tell
of
plans
to
get
the
good
people
out
who
were
waiting
for
us
beside
the
little
spring
in
the
desert
we
talked
of
going
back
at
once
but
our
meat
was
too
near
gone
and
we
must
take
them
something
to
encourage
them
a
little
and
make
them
strong
for
the
fearful
trip
as
to
these
birds
the
quail
was
as
superb
a
morsel
as
ever
a
man
did
eat
the
hawk
was
pretty
fair
and
quite
good
eating
but
that
abominable
crow
his
flesh
was
about
as
black
as
his
feathers
and
full
of
tough
and
bony
sinews
we
concluded
we
did
not
want
any
more
of
that
kind
of
bird
and
ever
since
that
day
when
i
have
heard
people
talk
of
eating
crow
as
a
bitter
pill
i
think
i
know
all
about
it
from
experience
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
way
for
us
but
to
push
on
in
the
morning
and
try
to
obtain
some
relief
for
the
poor
women
and
children
and
then
get
back
to
them
as
fast
as
ever
we
could
so
we
shouldered
our
packs
and
went
on
down
the
cañon
as
fast
as
we
could
we
came
soon
to
evergreen
oaks
and
tall
cottonwoods
and
the
creek
bottom
widened
out
to
two
hundred
yards
there
were
trees
on
the
south
side
and
the
brush
kept
getting
larger
and
larger
there
was
a
trail
down
this
cañon
but
as
it
passed
under
fallen
trees
we
knew
it
could
not
have
been
the
same
one
we
had
been
following
on
the
other
side
of
the
summit
and
when
we
discovered
a
bear
track
in
a
soft
place
we
knew
very
well
it
was
not
a
trail
intended
for
human
beings
and
we
might
be
ordered
out
almost
any
moment
on
the
high
bold
grassy
point
about
four
hundred
yards
we
saw
two
horses
that
held
their
heads
aloft
and
gave
a
snort
then
galloped
away
out
of
sight
about
i
felt
a
sudden
pain
in
my
left
knee
keen
and
sharp
and
as
we
went
along
it
kept
growing
worse
i
had
to
stop
often
to
rest
and
it
was
quite
plain
that
if
this
increased
or
continued
i
was
sure
enough
disabled
and
would
be
kept
from
helping
those
whom
we
had
left
nerved
with
the
idea
we
must
get
help
to
them
and
that
right
soon
i
hobbled
along
as
well
as
i
could
but
soon
had
to
say
to
rogers
that
he
had
better
go
on
ahead
and
get
help
and
let
me
come
on
as
best
i
could
for
every
moment
of
delay
was
a
danger
of
death
to
our
party
who
trusted
us
to
get
them
help
rogers
refused
to
do
this
he
said
he
would
stay
with
me
and
see
me
out
and
that
he
could
not
do
much
alone
and
had
better
wait
till
i
got
better
so
we
worked
along
through
the
tangled
brush
being
many
times
compelled
to
wade
the
stream
to
get
along
and
this
made
our
moccasins
soft
and
very
uncomfortable
to
wear
i
endured
the
pain
all
day
and
we
must
have
advanced
quite
a
little
distance
in
spite
of
my
lameness
but
i
was
glad
when
night
came
and
we
camped
in
the
dark
brushy
cañon
having
a
big
fire
which
made
me
quite
comfortable
all
night
though
it
was
quite
cold
and
we
had
to
keep
close
together
so
as
to
use
the
blanket
i
felt
a
little
better
in
the
morning
and
after
eating
some
of
our
poor
dried
meat
which
was
about
as
poor
as
crow
and
i
do
know
but
a
little
worse
we
continued
on
our
way
the
tangle
got
worse
and
worse
as
we
descended
and
at
times
we
walked
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
in
order
to
make
more
headway
but
my
lameness
increased
and
we
had
to
go
very
slow
indeed
about
noon
we
came
to
what
looked
like
an
excavation
a
hole
four
feet
square
or
more
it
looked
to
be
and
on
the
dirt
thrown
out
some
cottonwood
trees
had
grown
and
one
of
the
largest
of
these
had
been
cut
down
sometime
before
this
was
the
first
sign
of
white
men
we
had
seen
and
it
was
evidently
an
attempt
at
mining
no
one
knows
how
long
ago
it
encouraged
us
at
any
rate
and
we
pushed
on
through
brush
and
briers
tangles
of
wild
rose
bushes
and
bushes
of
every
sort
till
all
of
a
sudden
we
came
out
into
an
open
sandy
valley
well
covered
with
sage
brush
and
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
wide
probably
more
the
hills
on
the
south
side
had
on
them
some
oak
trees
and
grassy
spots
but
the
north
side
was
thickly
covered
with
brush
our
beautiful
little
brook
that
had
kept
us
company
soon
sank
into
the
dry
sand
out
of
sight
and
we
moved
rather
slowly
along
every
little
while
we
spoke
of
the
chances
of
wagons
ever
getting
through
the
road
we
had
come
and
the
hope
that
my
lameness
might
not
continue
to
retard
our
progress
in
getting
back
to
the
place
of
our
starting
that
the
poor
waiting
people
might
begin
to
get
out
of
the
terrible
country
they
were
in
and
enjoy
as
we
had
done
the
beautiful
running
stream
of
this
side
of
the
mountain
if
i
did
not
get
better
the
chances
were
that
they
would
perish
for
they
never
could
come
through
alone
as
the
distance
had
proved
much
greater
than
we
had
anticipated
and
long
dry
stretches
of
the
desert
were
more
than
they
would
be
prepared
for
as
it
was
we
feared
greatly
that
we
had
consumed
so
much
time
they
would
get
impatient
and
start
out
and
be
lost
i
continued
to
hobble
along
down
the
barren
valley
as
well
as
i
could
and
here
and
there
some
tracks
of
animals
were
discovered
but
we
could
not
make
out
whether
they
were
those
of
domestic
cattle
or
elk
soon
on
the
side
of
a
hill
rather
high
up
a
pack
of
prairie
wolves
were
snarling
around
the
carcass
of
some
dead
animal
and
this
was
regarded
as
another
sign
that
more
and
better
meat
could
be
found
for
these
animals
only
live
where
some
sort
of
game
can
be
found
and
they
knew
better
than
we
that
it
was
not
for
their
health
to
go
into
the
barren
desert
before
us
now
was
a
spur
from
the
hills
that
reached
nearly
across
our
little
valley
and
shut
out
further
sight
in
that
direction
and
when
we
came
to
it
we
climbed
up
over
it
to
shorten
the
distance
when
the
summit
was
reached
a
most
pleasing
sight
filled
our
sick
hearts
with
a
most
indescribable
joy
i
shall
never
have
the
ability
to
adequately
describe
the
beauty
of
the
scene
as
it
appeared
to
us
and
so
long
as
i
live
that
landscape
will
be
impressed
upon
the
canvas
of
my
memory
as
the
most
cheering
in
the
world
there
before
us
was
a
beautiful
meadow
of
a
thousand
acres
green
as
a
thick
carpet
of
grass
could
make
it
and
shaded
with
oaks
wide
branching
and
symmetrical
equal
to
those
of
an
old
english
park
while
all
over
the
low
mountains
that
bordered
it
on
the
south
and
over
the
broad
acres
of
luxuriant
grass
was
a
herd
of
cattle
numbering
many
hundreds
if
not
thousands
they
were
of
all
colors
shades
and
sizes
some
were
calmly
lying
down
in
happy
rumination
others
rapidly
cropping
the
sweet
grass
while
the
gay
calves
worked
off
their
superfluous
life
and
spirit
in
vigorous
exercise
or
drew
rich
nourishment
in
the
abundant
mother
milk
all
seemed
happy
and
content
and
such
a
scene
of
abundance
and
rich
plenty
and
comfort
bursting
thus
upon
our
eyes
which
for
months
had
seen
only
the
desolation
and
sadness
of
the
desert
was
like
getting
a
glimpse
of
paradise
and
tears
of
joy
ran
down
our
faces
if
ever
a
poor
mortal
escapes
from
this
world
where
so
many
trials
come
and
joys
of
a
happy
heaven
are
opened
up
to
him
the
change
can
not
be
much
more
that
this
which
was
suddenly
opened
to
us
on
that
bright
day
which
was
either
one
of
the
very
last
of
december
or
the
first
of
january
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
was
the
very
day
of
the
new
year
but
in
our
troubles
the
accuracy
of
the
calendar
was
among
the
least
of
our
troubles
if
it
was
as
i
believe
the
beginning
of
the
year
it
was
certainly
a
most
auspicious
one
and
one
of
the
most
hopeful
of
my
life
and
if
the
others
were
only
was
the
burden
of
our
thought
and
a
serious
awakening
from
the
dream
of
beauty
and
rich
plenty
spread
out
before
us
this
and
speckled
herd
might
be
descended
directly
from
jacob
famous
herd
blessed
of
the
lord
and
while
we
could
not
keep
our
thoughts
from
some
sad
doubts
as
to
the
fate
of
those
whom
we
had
left
behind
we
tried
to
be
generally
hopeful
and
courageous
and
brightened
up
our
steps
to
prepare
for
a
relief
and
return
to
the
hot
dry
plain
beyond
the
mountains
where
they
were
awaiting
us
no
doubt
with
much
tribulation
i
now
thought
of
myself
and
my
failing
knee
and
we
sat
down
under
the
shade
of
an
oak
to
rest
and
after
a
little
better
feeling
seemed
to
come
down
by
a
deep
gully
cut
by
the
rains
a
yearling
steer
was
feeding
and
i
took
the
rifle
and
crawled
down
near
him
and
put
first
one
ball
through
him
and
then
another
before
he
fell
dead
on
the
other
side
of
the
wash
when
we
sprang
with
all
the
agility
of
a
deer
we
quickly
got
some
good
meat
and
had
it
roasted
and
eaten
almost
quicker
than
can
be
told
we
hardly
realized
how
near
starved
we
were
till
we
had
plenty
before
us
again
we
ate
till
we
were
satisfied
for
once
and
for
the
first
time
in
many
long
dreary
weeks
we
kindled
a
fire
and
commenced
drying
the
meat
one
sleeping
while
the
other
kept
the
fire
and
changing
off
every
few
hours
what
a
rest
that
was
one
who
has
never
been
nearly
worn
out
and
starved
down
nearly
to
the
point
of
death
can
never
know
what
it
is
to
rest
in
comfort
no
one
can
tell
it
was
like
a
dream
a
sweet
restful
dream
where
troubles
would
drown
themselves
in
sleep
how
we
felt
the
strength
come
back
to
us
with
that
food
and
the
long
draughts
of
pure
clear
water
the
miserable
dried
meat
in
our
knapsacks
was
put
away
and
this
splendid
jerked
beef
put
in
its
place
the
wolves
came
to
our
camp
and
howled
in
dreadful
disappointment
at
not
getting
a
meal
rogers
wanted
me
to
shoot
the
miserable
howlers
but
i
let
them
have
their
concert
out
and
thought
going
without
their
breakfast
must
be
punishment
enough
for
them
as
our
moccasins
were
worn
out
we
carefully
prepared
some
sinews
from
the
steer
and
made
new
foot
gear
from
the
green
hide
which
placed
us
in
shape
for
two
or
three
week
walking
the
morning
was
clear
and
pleasant
we
had
our
knapsacks
filled
with
good
food
we
had
prepared
and
were
enjoying
the
cool
breeze
which
came
up
the
valley
when
we
heard
faintly
the
bark
of
a
dog
or
at
least
we
thought
we
did
if
this
were
true
there
must
be
some
one
living
not
very
far
away
and
we
felt
better
i
was
still
very
lame
and
as
we
started
along
the
walking
seemed
to
make
it
worse
again
so
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
follow
john
on
the
trail
down
the
valley
as
we
went
along
a
man
and
woman
passed
us
some
distance
on
the
left
and
they
did
not
seem
to
notice
us
though
we
were
in
plain
sight
they
were
curiously
dressed
the
woman
had
no
hoops
nor
shoes
and
a
shawl
wound
about
her
neck
and
one
end
thrown
over
her
head
was
a
substitute
bonnet
the
man
had
sandals
on
his
feet
with
white
cotton
pants
a
calico
shirt
and
a
wide
rimmed
comical
hat
we
at
once
put
them
down
as
spaniards
or
then
descendants
of
mexico
and
if
what
we
had
read
about
them
in
books
was
true
we
were
in
a
set
of
land
pirates
and
blood
thirsty
men
whom
we
might
have
occasion
to
be
aware
of
we
had
never
heard
a
word
of
spanish
spoken
except
perhaps
a
word
or
two
upon
the
plains
which
some
fellow
knew
and
how
we
could
make
ourselves
known
and
explain
who
we
were
was
a
puzzle
to
us
difficulties
began
to
arise
in
our
minds
now
we
were
in
an
apparent
land
of
plenty
but
in
spite
of
all
we
went
along
as
fast
as
my
lame
knee
would
permit
me
to
do
a
house
on
higher
ground
soon
appeared
in
sight
it
was
low
of
one
story
with
a
flat
roof
gray
in
color
and
of
a
different
style
of
architecture
from
any
we
had
ever
seen
before
there
was
no
fence
around
it
and
no
animals
or
wagons
in
sight
nor
person
to
be
seen
as
we
walked
up
the
hill
toward
it
i
told
john
our
moccasins
made
of
green
hide
would
betray
us
as
having
recently
killed
an
animal
and
as
these
people
might
be
the
owners
and
detain
us
by
having
us
arrested
for
the
crime
and
this
would
be
especially
bad
for
us
just
now
we
determined
to
face
the
people
and
let
the
fact
of
our
close
necessities
be
a
sufficient
excuse
for
us
if
we
could
make
them
understand
our
circumstances
as
we
came
near
the
house
no
person
was
seen
but
a
mule
tied
to
a
post
told
us
there
was
some
one
about
and
a
man
soon
made
an
appearance
dressed
about
the
same
style
as
the
one
we
had
passed
a
short
time
before
as
we
came
near
we
saluted
him
bidding
him
good
morning
and
he
in
turn
touched
his
hat
politely
saying
something
in
reply
which
we
were
not
able
to
understand
i
showed
him
that
i
was
lame
and
taking
out
some
money
pointed
to
the
mule
but
he
only
shook
his
head
and
said
something
i
could
not
comprehend
rogers
now
began
looking
around
the
house
which
was
built
of
bricks
about
one
by
two
feet
in
size
and
one
end
was
used
as
a
storehouse
as
he
looked
in
a
man
came
to
him
and
wanted
a
black
patent
leather
belt
which
rogers
wore
having
a
attached
to
it
he
offered
a
quart
or
more
of
coarse
corn
meal
and
rogers
made
the
trade
we
tried
to
inquire
where
we
were
or
where
ought
to
go
but
could
get
no
satisfactory
answer
from
the
man
although
when
we
spoke
san
francisco
he
pointed
to
the
north
this
was
not
very
satisfactory
to
us
and
we
seemed
as
badly
lost
as
ever
and
where
or
which
way
to
go
we
did
not
seem
very
successful
in
finding
out
so
we
concluded
to
go
on
a
little
way
at
least
and
i
hobbled
off
in
the
direction
he
pointed
which
was
down
the
hill
and
past
a
small
poorly
fenced
field
which
was
sometimes
cultivated
and
across
the
stream
which
followed
down
the
valley
passing
on
a
mile
or
two
we
stopped
on
a
big
patch
of
sand
to
rest
i
told
rogers
i
did
not
think
this
course
would
lead
us
to
any
place
in
a
month
and
just
now
a
delay
was
ruinous
to
us
and
to
those
who
were
waiting
for
us
and
it
would
not
do
for
us
to
go
off
to
the
north
to
find
a
settlement
while
i
was
expressing
my
opinion
on
matters
and
things
rogers
had
wet
up
a
part
of
his
meal
with
water
and
put
it
to
bake
on
the
cover
of
his
camp
kettle
there
was
a
fair
sized
cake
for
each
of
us
and
it
was
the
first
bread
of
any
kind
we
had
eaten
for
months
being
a
very
acceptable
change
from
an
exclusively
meat
diet
looking
up
the
valley
we
could
see
a
cloud
of
dust
thick
and
high
and
soon
several
men
on
horseback
who
came
at
a
rushing
gallop
i
told
rogers
they
were
after
us
and
believed
them
to
be
a
murderous
set
who
might
make
trouble
for
us
i
hastily
buried
our
little
store
of
money
in
the
sand
telling
him
that
if
they
got
us
they
would
not
get
our
money
putting
our
guns
across
our
laps
in
an
easy
position
we
had
them
cocked
and
ready
for
business
and
our
knives
where
we
could
get
them
handy
and
awaited
their
arrival
they
came
on
with
a
rush
until
within
a
short
distance
and
halted
for
consultation
just
across
the
creek
after
which
one
of
them
advanced
toward
us
and
as
he
came
near
us
we
could
see
he
was
a
white
man
who
wished
us
good
evening
in
our
own
language
we
answered
him
rather
cooly
still
sitting
in
the
sand
and
he
no
doubt
saw
that
we
were
a
little
suspicious
of
the
crowd
he
asked
us
where
we
were
from
and
we
told
him
our
circumstances
and
condition
and
that
we
would
like
to
secure
some
means
of
relief
for
the
people
we
had
left
in
the
desert
but
our
means
were
very
limited
and
we
wanted
to
do
the
best
we
could
he
said
we
were
about
miles
from
san
francisco
not
far
from
miles
from
the
coast
and
thirty
miles
from
los
angeles
we
were
much
afraid
we
would
not
be
able
to
get
anything
here
but
he
told
us
to
go
across
the
valley
to
a
large
live
oak
tree
which
he
pointed
out
and
said
we
would
find
an
american
there
and
we
should
wait
there
till
morning
he
said
he
would
go
back
and
stay
at
the
house
we
had
passed
and
would
do
what
he
could
to
assist
us
to
go
to
los
angeles
where
we
could
get
some
supplies
then
he
rode
away
and
as
we
talked
it
over
we
saw
no
way
but
to
follow
the
directions
of
our
newfound
friend
it
seemed
now
that
my
lameness
had
indeed
been
a
blessing
if
i
had
been
able
to
walk
we
would
now
have
been
well
on
toward
the
seashore
where
we
could
have
found
no
such
friend
as
this
who
had
appeared
to
us
the
way
seemed
clearer
to
us
but
the
time
for
our
return
was
almost
up
and
there
was
no
way
of
getting
back
in
fifteen
days
as
we
had
agreed
upon
so
there
was
great
danger
to
our
people
yet
it
seemed
very
likely
to
take
us
twenty
four
or
thirty
days
at
best
and
while
they
probably
had
oxen
enough
to
provide
them
food
for
so
long
a
time
they
might
take
a
notion
to
move
on
which
would
be
fatal
at
the
big
live
oak
tree
we
found
an
american
camper
who
was
on
his
way
to
the
gold
mines
he
was
going
a
new
route
and
said
the
mines
could
be
reached
much
quicker
than
by
going
up
the
coast
by
way
of
san
francisco
a
new
company
with
wagons
was
soon
to
start
out
to
break
the
road
and
when
they
crossed
the
east
end
of
the
valley
he
would
follow
them
i
think
this
man
name
was
springer
he
had
come
by
way
of
the
santa
fe
route
and
the
people
of
los
angeles
had
told
him
this
route
was
an
easy
one
being
often
traveled
by
saddle
horses
and
if
the
company
could
make
it
possible
for
wagons
they
could
have
all
the
cattle
they
wanted
to
kill
along
the
road
as
their
pay
for
doing
the
work
our
new
friend
lay
down
early
and
as
he
saw
we
were
scant
in
blankets
he
brought
some
to
us
for
our
use
which
were
most
thankfully
received
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
rogers
mixed
up
some
more
of
the
meal
which
we
baked
in
our
friend
frying
pan
and
we
baked
and
ate
and
baked
and
ate
again
for
our
appetites
were
ravenous
and
the
demand
of
our
stomachs
got
the
better
of
the
judgment
of
our
brains
it
was
hard
to
find
time
to
sleep
we
were
so
full
of
the
plans
about
the
way
which
we
must
manage
to
get
relief
for
the
people
we
had
many
doubts
if
animals
could
ever
come
over
the
route
we
had
come
over
from
deliberation
we
decided
that
by
selecting
a
route
with
that
idea
in
our
minds
we
could
get
mules
and
perhaps
horses
over
the
country
we
perhaps
could
go
more
to
the
north
and
take
the
jayhawkers
trail
but
this
would
take
us
fully
a
hundred
miles
farther
and
four
or
five
days
longer
at
the
best
and
every
moment
of
delay
was
to
be
carefully
avoided
as
a
moment
of
danger
to
our
friends
thus
again
our
sleep
was
troubled
from
another
cause
being
so
long
unaccustomed
to
vegetable
food
and
helped
on
no
doubt
by
our
poor
judgment
in
gauging
the
quantity
of
our
food
we
were
attacked
by
severe
pains
in
the
stomach
and
bowels
from
which
we
suffered
intensely
we
arose
very
early
and
with
a
very
light
breakfast
for
the
sickness
admonished
us
we
started
back
for
the
house
we
had
first
passed
at
which
our
friend
on
horseback
said
he
would
spend
the
night
and
where
we
were
to
meet
him
this
morning
he
said
he
could
talk
spanish
all
right
and
would
do
all
he
could
to
help
us
our
suffering
and
trouble
caused
us
to
move
very
slowly
so
that
it
was
nine
or
ten
before
we
reached
the
house
and
we
found
they
had
two
horses
all
ready
for
us
to
go
to
los
angeles
there
were
no
saddles
for
us
but
we
thought
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
cure
my
lameness
the
people
seemed
to
be
friends
to
us
in
every
way
we
mounted
having
our
packs
on
our
backs
and
our
guns
before
us
and
with
a
friendly
parting
to
the
people
who
did
not
go
all
four
of
us
started
on
a
trip
of
thirty
miles
to
the
town
of
los
angeles
when
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
which
was
very
steep
but
not
rocky
john
and
i
dismounted
and
led
our
animals
to
the
top
where
we
could
see
a
long
way
west
and
south
and
it
looked
supremely
beautiful
we
could
not
help
comparing
it
to
the
long
wide
desert
we
had
crossed
and
john
and
myself
said
many
times
how
we
wished
the
folks
were
here
to
enjoy
the
pleasant
sight
the
beautiful
fertile
picture
there
appeared
to
be
one
quite
large
house
in
sight
and
not
far
off
which
the
man
told
us
was
the
mission
of
san
fernando
a
roman
catholic
church
and
residence
for
priests
and
followers
the
downward
slope
of
the
mountain
was
as
steep
as
the
other
side
and
larger
and
john
and
i
did
not
attempt
to
mount
till
we
were
well
down
on
the
level
ground
again
but
the
other
two
men
rode
up
and
down
without
any
trouble
we
would
let
our
leaders
get
half
a
mile
or
so
ahead
of
us
and
then
mount
and
put
our
horses
to
a
gallop
till
we
overtook
them
again
we
had
walked
so
long
that
riding
was
very
tiresome
to
us
and
for
comfort
alone
we
would
have
preferred
the
way
on
foot
but
we
could
get
along
a
little
faster
and
the
frequent
dismounting
kept
us
from
becoming
too
lame
from
riding
we
passed
the
mission
about
noon
or
a
little
after
and
a
few
miles
beyond
met
a
man
on
horseback
who
lived
up
to
the
north
about
a
hundred
miles
his
name
was
french
and
he
had
a
cattle
range
at
a
place
called
tejon
tahone
our
friends
told
him
who
we
were
and
what
assistance
we
needed
french
said
he
was
well
acquainted
in
los
angeles
and
had
been
there
some
time
and
that
all
the
travelers
who
would
take
the
coast
route
had
gone
those
who
had
come
by
way
of
salt
lake
had
got
in
from
two
to
four
weeks
before
and
a
small
train
which
had
come
the
santa
fe
route
was
still
upon
the
road
he
said
los
angeles
was
so
clear
of
emigrants
that
he
did
not
think
we
could
get
any
help
there
at
the
present
time
now
said
french
you
boys
ca
talk
spanish
and
it
is
not
very
likely
you
will
be
able
to
get
any
help
now
i
say
you
boys
turn
back
and
go
with
me
and
i
will
give
you
the
best
i
have
i
will
let
you
have
a
yoke
of
gentle
oxen
or
more
if
you
need
them
and
plenty
of
beans
which
are
good
food
for
i
live
on
them
besides
this
i
can
give
an
indian
guide
to
help
you
back
will
that
do
after
a
moment
we
said
we
doubted
if
oxen
could
be
got
over
the
road
and
if
they
were
fat
now
they
would
soon
get
poor
and
perhaps
not
stand
it
as
well
as
the
oxen
which
had
became
used
to
that
kind
of
life
and
of
those
they
had
in
camp
all
they
needed
we
wanted
to
get
something
for
the
women
and
children
to
ride
for
we
knew
they
must
abandon
the
wagons
and
could
not
walk
so
far
over
that
dry
rough
country
well
said
french
i
will
stop
at
the
place
you
were
this
morning
i
know
them
well
and
they
are
good
folks
and
i
am
sure
when
i
tell
them
what
you
want
they
will
help
you
if
they
possibly
can
this
looks
to
me
to
be
the
most
sensible
course
after
talking
an
hour
our
two
companions
advised
us
that
the
proposition
of
french
seemed
the
most
reasonable
one
that
appeared
but
for
us
to
go
clear
back
to
his
range
would
take
up
so
much
valuable
time
that
we
were
almost
afraid
of
the
delay
which
might
mean
the
destruction
of
our
friends
french
said
he
had
a
pack
saddle
with
him
taking
it
home
and
we
could
put
it
on
one
of
our
horses
and
when
we
came
back
to
los
angeles
could
leave
it
at
a
certain
saloon
or
place
he
named
and
tell
them
it
belonged
to
him
and
to
keep
it
for
him
i
have
forgotten
the
name
of
the
man
who
kept
the
saloon
we
agreed
to
this
and
bidding
our
two
companions
farewell
we
turned
back
again
with
french
when
night
came
we
were
again
at
the
mission
we
had
passed
on
the
way
down
we
were
kindly
treated
here
for
i
believe
french
told
them
about
us
they
sent
an
indian
to
take
our
horses
and
we
sat
down
beside
the
great
house
there
were
many
smaller
houses
and
quite
a
large
piece
of
ground
fenced
in
by
an
adobe
wall
the
roof
of
the
buildings
was
like
that
of
our
own
buildings
in
having
eaves
on
both
sides
but
the
covering
was
of
semi
circular
tiles
made
and
burned
like
brick
rows
of
these
were
placed
close
together
the
hollow
sides
up
and
then
another
course
over
the
joints
placed
with
the
round
side
up
which
made
a
roof
that
was
perfectly
waterproof
but
must
have
been
very
heavy
these
tiles
were
about
two
feet
long
all
the
surroundings
and
general
make
up
of
the
place
were
new
to
us
and
very
wonderful
they
gave
us
good
dried
meat
to
eat
and
let
us
sleep
in
the
big
house
on
the
floor
which
was
as
hard
as
granite
and
we
turned
over
a
great
many
times
before
daylight
and
were
glad
when
morning
came
we
offered
to
pay
them
but
they
would
take
nothing
from
us
and
we
left
leading
our
horses
over
the
steep
mountain
and
reaching
the
house
again
late
in
the
day
they
turned
our
horses
loose
and
seemed
disposed
to
be
very
friendly
and
disposed
to
do
for
us
what
they
could
we
were
very
tired
and
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
house
and
rested
wondering
how
we
would
come
out
with
our
preparations
they
were
talking
together
but
we
could
not
understand
a
word
a
dark
woman
came
out
and
gave
each
of
us
a
piece
of
cooked
squash
it
seemed
to
have
been
roasted
in
the
ashes
and
was
very
sweet
and
good
these
were
all
signs
of
friendship
and
we
were
glad
of
the
good
feeling
we
were
given
a
place
to
sleep
in
the
house
in
a
store
room
on
a
floor
which
was
not
soft
this
was
the
second
house
we
had
slept
in
since
leaving
wisconsin
and
it
seemed
rather
to
us
in
the
morning
we
were
shown
a
kind
of
mill
like
a
coffee
mill
and
by
putting
in
a
handful
of
wheat
from
a
pile
and
giving
the
mill
a
few
turns
we
were
given
to
understand
we
should
grind
some
flour
for
ourselves
we
went
to
work
with
a
will
but
found
it
hard
slow
work
after
a
little
our
dark
woman
came
and
gave
us
each
a
pancake
and
a
piece
of
meat
also
another
piece
of
roasted
squash
for
our
breakfast
and
this
we
thought
was
the
best
meal
we
had
ever
eaten
the
lady
tried
to
talk
to
us
but
we
could
not
understand
the
words
and
i
could
convey
ideas
to
her
better
by
the
sign
language
than
any
other
way
she
pointed
out
the
way
from
which
we
came
and
wanted
to
know
how
many
travel
it
might
be
away
and
i
answered
by
putting
my
hand
to
my
head
and
closing
my
eyes
which
was
repeated
as
many
times
as
there
had
been
nights
on
our
journey
at
which
she
was
much
surprised
that
the
folks
were
so
far
away
she
then
place
her
hand
upon
her
breast
and
then
held
it
up
to
ask
how
many
women
there
were
and
i
answered
her
by
holding
up
three
fingers
at
which
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
shook
her
head
then
pointing
to
a
child
by
her
side
four
or
five
years
old
and
in
the
same
way
asked
how
many
children
i
answered
by
holding
up
four
fingers
and
she
almost
cried
opening
her
mouth
in
great
surprise
and
turned
away
i
said
to
rogers
that
she
was
a
kind
well
meaning
woman
and
that
french
had
no
doubt
told
her
something
of
our
story
aside
from
her
dark
complexion
her
features
reminded
me
of
my
mother
and
at
first
sight
of
her
i
thought
of
the
best
woman
on
earth
my
own
far
off
mother
who
little
knew
the
hardships
we
had
endured
we
went
to
work
again
at
the
mill
and
after
a
while
the
woman
came
again
and
tried
to
talk
and
to
teach
us
some
words
of
her
own
language
she
place
her
finger
on
me
and
said
and
i
took
out
my
little
book
and
wrote
down
as
meaning
man
and
in
the
same
way
she
taught
me
that
was
woman
wheat
beans
meat
pumpkin
horse
cow
boy
and
several
other
words
in
this
way
i
got
hold
of
many
words
thus
to
study
so
that
if
i
ever
came
back
i
could
talk
a
little
and
make
myself
understood
as
to
some
of
the
common
objects
and
things
of
necessary
use
such
friendly
human
acts
shown
to
us
strangers
were
evidences
of
the
kindest
disposition
i
shall
never
forget
the
kindness
of
those
original
californians
when
in
camp
and
finding
he
was
friendly
to
mormonism
we
could
claim
that
we
were
also
mormons
but
the
good
people
though
well
known
catholics
did
not
so
much
as
mention
the
fact
nor
inquire
whether
we
favored
that
sect
or
not
we
were
human
beings
in
distress
and
we
represented
others
who
were
worse
even
than
we
and
those
kind
acts
and
great
good
will
were
given
freely
because
we
were
fellow
human
beings
the
provisions
we
prepared
were
a
sack
of
small
yellow
beans
a
small
sack
of
wheat
a
quantity
of
good
dried
meat
and
some
of
the
coarse
unbolted
flour
we
had
made
at
the
mills
they
showed
us
how
to
properly
pack
the
horse
which
was
a
kind
of
work
we
had
not
been
use
to
and
we
were
soon
ready
for
a
start
i
took
what
money
we
had
and
put
it
on
a
block
making
signs
for
them
to
take
what
the
things
were
worth
they
took
and
we
were
quite
surprised
to
get
two
horses
provisions
and
ropes
some
of
the
latter
made
of
rawhide
and
some
of
hair
so
cheaply
but
we
afterward
learned
that
the
mares
furnished
were
not
considered
of
much
value
and
we
had
really
paid
a
good
fair
price
for
everything
to
make
it
easy
for
us
they
had
also
fixed
our
knapsacks
on
the
horses
the
good
lady
with
the
child
came
out
with
four
oranges
and
pointed
to
her
own
child
and
then
to
the
east
put
them
in
the
pack
meaning
we
should
carry
them
to
the
children
with
a
hearty
good
bye
from
them
and
a
polite
lifting
of
our
hats
to
them
we
started
on
our
return
down
toward
the
gentle
decline
of
the
creek
bottom
and
then
up
the
valley
the
way
we
came
toward
night
we
came
to
a
wagon
road
crossing
the
valley
and
as
we
well
knew
we
could
not
go
up
the
tangled
creek
bed
with
horses
we
took
this
road
to
the
north
which
took
a
dry
ravine
for
its
direction
and
in
which
there
was
a
pack
trail
and
this
the
wagons
were
following
we
kept
on
the
trail
for
a
few
miles
and
overtook
them
in
their
camp
and
camped
with
them
over
night
we
told
them
we
considered
our
outfit
entirely
too
small
for
the
purpose
intended
which
was
to
bring
two
women
and
four
children
out
of
the
desert
but
that
being
the
best
we
could
get
we
were
taking
this
help
to
them
and
hoped
to
save
their
lives
our
mission
became
well
known
and
one
man
offered
to
sell
us
a
poor
little
mule
its
back
all
bare
of
covering
from
the
effect
of
a
great
saddle
sore
that
had
very
recently
healed
he
had
picked
it
up
somewhere
in
arizona
where
it
had
been
turned
out
to
die
but
it
seemed
the
beast
had
enough
of
the
good
santa
ana
stock
in
it
to
bring
it
through
and
it
had
no
notion
of
dying
at
the
present
time
though
it
was
scarcely
more
than
a
good
fair
skeleton
even
then
the
beast
became
mine
at
the
price
of
and
the
people
expressed
great
sympathy
with
us
and
the
dear
friends
we
were
going
to
try
to
save
another
man
offered
a
little
mare
as
fat
as
butter
for
which
i
paid
though
it
took
the
last
cent
of
money
i
had
this
little
beauty
of
a
beast
was
broken
to
lead
at
halter
but
had
not
been
broken
in
any
other
way
rogers
said
he
would
ride
her
where
he
could
and
before
she
got
to
the
wagons
she
would
be
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
he
got
a
bridle
and
tried
her
at
once
and
then
there
was
a
scene
of
rearing
jumping
and
kicking
that
would
have
made
a
good
buffalo
bill
circus
in
these
days
no
use
the
man
could
not
be
thrown
off
and
the
crowd
cheered
and
shouted
to
rogers
to
hold
her
level
after
some
bucking
and
backing
on
the
part
of
the
mare
and
a
good
deal
of
whipping
and
kicking
on
the
part
of
the
man
and
a
good
many
furious
clashes
in
lively
but
very
awkward
ways
the
little
beast
yielded
the
point
and
carried
her
load
without
further
trouble
the
people
gave
us
a
good
supper
and
breakfast
and
one
man
came
and
presented
us
with
pounds
of
unbolted
wheat
flour
they
were
of
great
assistance
to
us
in
showing
us
how
to
pack
and
sack
our
load
which
was
not
heavy
and
could
be
easily
carried
by
our
two
animals
which
we
had
at
first
however
we
arranged
a
pack
on
the
mule
and
this
gave
me
a
horse
to
ride
and
a
mule
to
lead
while
rogers
rode
his
steed
and
led
the
other
horse
thus
we
went
along
and
following
the
trail
soon
reached
the
summit
from
which
we
could
see
off
to
the
east
a
wonderful
distance
probably
miles
of
the
dry
and
barren
desert
of
hill
and
desolate
valley
over
which
we
had
come
the
trail
bearing
still
to
the
north
from
this
point
we
left
and
turned
due
east
across
the
country
and
soon
came
to
a
beautiful
lake
of
sweet
fresh
water
situated
well
up
toward
the
top
of
the
mountain
this
lake
is
now
called
elizabeth
lake
here
we
watered
our
animals
and
filled
our
canteens
then
steered
a
little
south
of
east
among
the
cabbage
trees
aiming
to
strike
the
rain
water
hole
where
we
had
camped
as
we
came
over
we
reached
the
water
hole
about
noon
and
here
found
the
jayhawkers
trail
which
we
took
they
had
evidently
followed
us
and
passed
down
the
same
brushy
cañon
while
we
having
taken
a
circuitous
route
to
the
north
had
gone
around
there
getting
water
here
for
ourselves
and
horses
we
went
back
to
the
trail
and
pushed
on
as
fast
as
the
animals
could
walk
and
as
we
now
knew
where
we
could
get
water
we
kept
on
till
after
dark
one
of
us
walking
to
keep
the
trail
and
some
time
in
the
night
reached
the
willow
corral
i
have
spoken
of
before
there
was
good
water
here
but
the
jayhawker
oxen
had
eaten
all
the
grass
that
grew
in
the
little
moist
place
around
and
our
animals
were
short
of
feed
one
of
us
agreed
to
stand
guard
the
fore
part
of
the
night
and
the
other
later
so
that
we
might
not
be
surprised
by
indians
and
lose
our
animals
i
took
the
first
watch
and
let
the
blaze
of
the
fire
go
out
so
as
not
to
attract
attention
and
as
i
sat
by
the
dull
coals
and
hot
ashes
i
fell
asleep
rogers
happened
to
wake
and
see
the
situation
and
arose
and
waked
me
again
saying
that
we
must
be
more
careful
or
the
indians
would
get
our
horses
you
may
be
sure
i
kept
awake
the
rest
of
my
watch
next
day
we
passed
the
water
holes
at
the
place
where
we
had
so
stealthily
crawled
up
to
doty
camp
when
coming
out
these
holes
held
about
two
pails
of
water
each
but
no
stream
run
away
from
them
our
horses
seemed
to
want
water
badly
for
when
they
drank
they
put
their
head
in
up
to
their
eyes
and
drank
ravenously
thirty
miles
from
here
to
the
next
water
doty
had
told
us
and
night
overtook
us
before
we
could
reach
it
so
a
dry
camp
was
made
our
horses
began
now
to
walk
with
drooping
heads
and
slow
tired
steps
so
we
divided
the
load
among
them
all
and
walked
ourselves
the
water
when
reached
proved
so
salt
the
horses
would
not
drink
it
and
as
doty
had
told
us
the
most
water
was
over
the
mountain
ahead
of
us
we
still
followed
their
trail
which
went
up
a
very
rocky
cañon
in
which
it
was
hard
work
for
the
horses
to
travel
the
horses
were
all
very
gentle
now
and
needed
some
urging
to
make
them
go
roger
fat
horse
no
longer
tried
to
unseat
its
rider
or
its
pack
but
seemed
to
be
the
most
downhearted
of
the
train
the
little
mule
was
the
liveliest
sharpest
witted
animal
of
the
whole
she
had
probably
traveled
on
the
desert
before
and
knew
better
how
to
get
along
she
had
learned
to
crop
every
spear
of
grass
she
came
to
and
every
bit
of
sage
brush
that
offered
a
green
leaf
was
given
a
nip
she
would
sometimes
leave
the
trail
and
go
out
to
one
side
to
get
a
little
bunch
of
dry
grass
and
come
back
and
take
her
place
again
as
if
she
knew
her
duty
the
other
animals
never
tried
to
do
this
the
mule
was
evidently
better
versed
in
the
art
of
getting
a
living
than
the
horses
above
the
rough
bed
of
the
cañon
the
bottom
was
gravelly
and
narrow
and
the
walls
on
each
side
nearly
perpendicular
our
horses
now
poked
slowly
along
and
as
we
passed
the
steep
wall
of
the
cañon
the
white
animal
left
the
trail
and
walked
with
full
force
head
first
against
the
solid
rock
she
seemed
to
be
blind
and
though
we
went
quickly
to
her
and
took
off
the
load
she
carried
she
had
stopped
breathing
by
the
time
we
had
it
done
not
knowing
how
far
it
was
to
water
nor
how
soon
some
of
our
other
horses
might
fall
we
did
not
tarry
but
pushed
on
as
well
as
we
could
finding
no
water
we
reached
the
summit
and
turned
down
a
ravine
following
the
trail
and
about
dark
came
to
the
water
they
had
told
us
about
a
faint
running
stream
which
came
out
of
a
rocky
ravine
and
sank
almost
immediately
in
the
dry
sand
there
was
water
enough
for
us
but
no
grass
it
seemed
as
if
the
horses
were
not
strong
enough
to
carry
a
load
and
as
we
wanted
to
get
them
through
if
possible
we
concluded
to
bury
the
wheat
and
get
it
on
our
return
we
dug
a
hole
and
lined
it
with
fine
sticks
then
put
in
the
little
bag
and
covered
it
with
dry
brush
and
sand
making
the
surface
as
smooth
as
if
it
had
never
been
touched
then
made
our
bed
on
it
the
whole
work
was
done
after
dark
so
the
deposit
could
not
be
seen
by
the
red
men
and
we
thought
we
had
done
it
pretty
carefully
next
morning
the
little
mule
carried
all
the
remaining
load
the
horses
bearing
only
their
saddles
and
seemed
hardly
strong
enough
for
that
there
was
now
seven
or
eight
miles
of
clean
loose
sand
to
go
over
across
a
little
valley
which
came
to
an
end
about
ten
miles
north
of
us
and
extended
south
to
the
lake
where
we
went
for
water
on
our
outward
journey
and
found
it
red
alkali
near
the
eastern
edge
of
the
valley
we
turned
aside
to
visit
the
grave
of
isham
which
they
had
told
us
of
they
had
covered
his
remains
with
their
hands
as
best
they
could
piling
up
a
little
mound
of
sand
over
it
our
next
camp
was
to
be
on
the
summit
of
the
range
just
before
us
and
we
passed
the
dead
body
of
mr
fish
we
had
seen
before
and
go
on
a
little
to
a
level
sandy
spot
in
the
ravine
just
large
enough
to
sleep
on
this
whole
range
is
a
black
mass
rocky
piece
of
earth
so
barren
that
not
a
spear
of
grass
can
grow
and
not
a
drop
of
water
in
any
place
we
tied
our
horses
to
rocks
and
there
they
staid
all
night
for
if
turned
loose
there
was
not
a
mouthful
of
food
for
them
to
get
in
the
morning
an
important
question
was
to
be
decided
and
that
was
whether
we
should
continue
to
follow
the
jayhawker
trail
which
led
far
to
the
north
to
cross
the
mountain
which
stood
before
us
a
mass
of
rocks
so
steep
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
dog
could
hardly
climb
it
our
wagons
were
nearly
due
east
from
this
point
over
the
range
and
not
more
than
fifty
miles
away
while
to
go
around
to
the
north
was
fully
a
hundred
miles
and
would
take
us
four
or
five
days
to
make
as
we
had
already
gone
so
long
we
expected
to
meet
them
any
day
trying
to
get
out
and
if
we
went
around
we
might
miss
them
they
might
have
all
been
killed
by
indians
or
they
might
have
already
gone
we
had
great
fears
on
their
account
if
they
had
gone
north
they
might
have
perished
in
the
snow
the
range
was
before
us
and
we
must
get
to
the
other
side
in
some
way
we
could
see
the
range
for
a
hundred
miles
to
the
north
and
along
the
base
some
lakes
of
water
that
must
be
salt
to
the
south
it
got
some
lower
but
very
barren
and
ending
in
black
dry
buttes
the
horses
must
have
food
and
water
by
night
or
we
must
leave
them
to
die
and
all
things
considered
it
seemed
to
be
the
quickest
way
to
camp
to
try
and
get
up
a
rough
looking
cañon
which
was
nearly
opposite
us
on
the
other
side
so
we
loaded
the
mule
and
made
our
way
down
the
rocky
road
to
the
ridge
and
then
left
the
jayhawker
trail
taking
our
course
more
south
so
as
to
get
around
a
salt
lake
which
lay
directly
before
us
on
our
way
we
had
to
go
close
to
a
steep
bluff
and
cross
a
piece
of
ground
that
looked
like
a
well
dried
mortar
bed
hard
and
smooth
as
ice
and
thus
got
around
the
head
of
a
small
stream
of
clear
water
salt
as
brine
we
now
went
directly
to
the
mouth
of
the
cañon
we
had
decided
to
take
and
traveled
up
its
gravelly
bed
the
horses
now
had
to
be
urged
along
constantly
to
keep
them
moving
and
they
held
their
heads
low
down
as
they
crept
along
seemingly
so
discouraged
that
they
would
much
rather
lie
down
and
rest
forever
than
take
another
step
we
knew
they
would
do
this
soon
in
spite
of
all
our
urging
if
we
could
not
get
water
for
them
the
cañon
was
rough
enough
where
we
entered
it
and
a
heavy
up
grade
too
and
this
grew
more
and
more
difficult
as
we
advanced
and
the
rough
yellowish
rocky
walls
closed
in
nearer
and
nearer
together
as
we
ascended
a
perpendicular
wall
or
rather
rise
in
the
rocks
was
approached
and
there
was
a
great
difficulty
to
persuade
the
horses
to
take
exertion
to
get
up
and
over
the
small
obstruction
but
the
little
mule
skipped
over
as
nimbly
as
a
goat
and
rather
seemed
to
enjoy
a
little
variety
in
the
proceedings
after
some
coaxing
and
urging
the
horses
took
courage
to
try
the
extra
step
and
succeeded
all
right
when
we
all
moved
on
again
over
a
path
that
grew
more
and
more
narrow
more
and
more
rocky
under
foot
at
every
moment
we
wound
around
among
and
between
the
great
rocks
and
had
not
advanced
very
far
before
another
obstruction
that
would
have
been
a
fall
of
about
three
feet
had
water
been
flowing
in
the
cañon
opposed
our
way
a
small
pile
of
lone
rocks
enabled
the
mule
to
go
over
all
right
and
she
went
on
looking
for
every
spear
of
grass
and
smelling
eagerly
for
water
but
all
our
efforts
were
not
enough
to
get
the
horses
along
another
foot
it
was
getting
nearly
night
and
every
minute
without
water
seemed
an
age
we
had
to
leave
the
horses
and
go
on
we
had
deemed
them
indispensable
to
us
or
rather
to
the
extrication
of
the
women
and
children
and
yet
the
hope
came
to
us
that
the
oxen
might
help
some
of
them
out
as
a
last
resort
we
were
sure
the
wagons
must
be
abandoned
and
such
a
thing
as
women
riding
on
the
backs
of
oxen
we
had
never
seen
still
it
occurred
to
us
as
not
impossible
and
although
leaving
the
horses
here
was
like
deciding
to
abandon
all
for
the
feeble
ones
we
saw
we
must
do
it
and
the
new
hope
arose
to
sustain
us
for
farther
effort
we
removed
the
saddles
and
placed
them
on
a
rock
and
after
a
few
moments
hesitation
moments
in
which
were
crowded
torrents
of
wild
ideas
and
desperate
thoughts
that
were
enough
to
drive
reason
from
its
throne
we
left
the
poor
animals
to
their
fate
and
moved
along
just
as
we
were
passing
out
of
sight
the
poor
creatures
neighed
pitifully
after
us
and
one
who
has
never
heard
the
last
despairing
pleading
neigh
of
a
horse
left
to
die
can
form
no
idea
of
its
almost
human
appeal
we
both
burst
into
tears
but
it
was
no
use
to
try
to
save
them
we
must
run
the
danger
of
sacrificing
ourselves
and
the
little
party
we
were
trying
so
hard
to
save
we
found
the
little
mule
stopped
by
a
still
higher
precipice
or
perpendicular
rise
of
fully
ten
feet
our
hearts
sank
within
us
and
we
said
that
we
should
return
to
our
friends
as
we
went
away
with
our
knapsacks
on
our
backs
and
the
hope
grew
very
small
the
little
mule
was
nipping
some
stray
blades
of
grass
and
as
we
came
in
sight
she
looked
around
to
us
and
then
up
the
steep
rocks
before
her
with
such
a
knowing
intelligent
look
of
confidence
that
it
gave
us
new
courage
it
was
a
strange
wild
place
the
north
wall
of
the
cañon
leaned
far
over
the
channel
overhanging
considerably
while
the
south
wall
sloped
back
about
the
same
making
the
wall
nearly
parallel
and
like
a
huge
crevice
descending
into
the
mountain
from
above
in
a
sloping
direction
we
decided
to
try
to
get
the
confident
little
mule
over
this
obstruction
gathering
all
the
loose
rocks
we
could
we
piled
them
up
against
the
south
wall
beginning
some
distance
below
putting
up
all
those
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
throwing
down
others
from
narrow
shelves
above
we
built
a
sort
of
inclined
plane
along
the
walls
gradually
rising
till
we
were
nearly
as
high
as
the
crest
of
the
fall
here
was
a
narrow
shelf
scarcely
four
inches
wide
and
a
space
of
from
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
to
cross
to
reach
the
level
of
the
crest
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
cross
this
space
and
there
was
no
foundation
to
enable
us
to
widen
it
so
as
to
make
a
path
for
an
animal
it
was
forlorn
hope
but
we
made
the
most
of
it
we
unpacked
the
mule
and
getting
all
our
ropes
together
made
a
leading
line
of
it
then
we
loosened
and
threw
down
all
the
projecting
points
of
rocks
we
could
above
the
narrow
shelf
and
every
piece
that
was
likely
to
come
loose
in
the
shelf
itself
we
fastened
the
leading
line
to
her
and
with
one
above
and
one
below
we
thought
we
could
help
her
to
keep
her
balance
and
if
she
did
not
make
a
misstep
on
that
narrow
way
she
might
get
over
safely
without
a
moments
hesitation
the
brave
animal
tried
the
pass
carefully
and
steadily
she
went
along
selecting
a
place
before
putting
down
a
foot
and
when
she
came
to
the
narrow
ledge
leaned
gently
on
the
rope
never
making
a
sudden
start
or
jump
but
cautiously
as
a
cat
moved
slowly
along
there
was
now
no
turning
back
for
her
she
must
cross
this
narrow
place
over
which
i
had
to
creep
on
hands
and
knees
or
be
dashed
down
fifty
feet
to
a
certain
death
when
the
worst
place
was
reached
she
stopped
and
hesitated
looking
back
as
well
as
she
could
i
was
ahead
with
the
rope
and
i
called
encouragingly
to
her
and
talked
to
her
a
little
rogers
wanted
to
get
all
ready
and
he
said
holler
at
her
as
loud
as
he
could
and
frighten
her
across
but
i
thought
the
best
way
to
talk
to
her
gently
and
let
her
move
steadily
i
tell
you
friends
it
was
a
trying
moment
it
seemed
to
be
weighed
down
with
all
the
trails
and
hardships
of
many
months
it
seemed
to
be
the
time
when
helpless
women
and
innocent
children
hung
on
the
trembling
balance
between
life
and
death
our
own
lives
we
could
save
by
going
back
and
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
we
would
perhaps
save
ourselves
the
additional
sorrow
of
finding
them
all
dead
to
do
so
at
once
i
was
so
nearly
in
despair
that
i
could
not
help
bursting
in
tears
and
i
was
not
ashamed
of
the
weakness
finally
rogers
said
come
lewis
and
i
gently
pulled
the
rope
calling
the
little
animal
to
make
a
trial
she
smelled
all
around
and
looked
over
every
inch
of
the
strong
ledge
then
took
one
careful
step
after
another
over
the
dangerous
place
looking
back
i
saw
rogers
with
a
very
large
stone
in
his
hand
ready
to
holler
and
perhaps
kill
the
poor
beast
if
she
stopped
but
she
crept
along
trusting
to
the
rope
to
balance
till
she
was
half
way
across
then
another
step
or
two
when
calculating
the
distance
closely
she
made
a
spring
and
landed
on
a
smooth
bit
of
sloping
rock
below
that
led
up
to
the
highest
crest
of
the
precipice
and
safely
climbed
to
the
top
safe
and
sound
above
the
falls
the
mule
had
no
shoes
and
it
was
wonderful
how
her
little
hoofs
clung
to
the
smooth
rock
we
felt
relieved
we
would
push
on
and
carry
food
to
the
people
we
would
get
them
through
some
way
there
could
be
no
more
hopeless
moment
than
the
one
just
past
and
we
would
save
them
all
it
was
the
work
of
a
little
while
to
transfer
the
load
up
the
precipice
and
pack
the
mule
again
when
we
proceeded
around
behind
some
rocks
only
a
little
distance
beyond
this
place
we
found
a
small
willow
bush
and
enough
good
water
for
a
camp
this
was
a
strange
cañon
the
sun
never
shown
down
to
the
bottom
in
the
fearful
place
where
the
little
mule
climbed
up
and
the
rocks
had
a
peculiar
yellow
color
in
getting
our
provisions
up
the
precipice
rogers
went
below
and
fastened
the
rope
while
i
pulled
them
up
rogers
wished
many
times
we
had
the
horses
up
safely
where
the
mule
was
but
a
dog
could
hardly
cross
the
narrow
path
and
there
was
no
hope
poor
brutes
they
had
been
faithful
servants
and
we
felt
sorrowful
enough
at
their
terrible
fate
we
had
walked
two
days
without
water
and
we
were
wonderfully
refreshed
as
we
found
it
here
the
way
up
this
cañon
was
very
rough
and
the
bed
full
of
sharp
broken
rocks
in
loose
pieces
which
cut
through
the
bottoms
of
our
moccasins
and
left
us
with
bare
feet
upon
the
acute
points
and
edges
i
took
off
one
of
my
buckskin
leggins
and
gave
it
to
rogers
and
with
the
other
one
for
myself
we
fixed
the
moccasins
with
them
as
well
as
we
could
which
enabled
us
to
go
ahead
but
i
think
if
our
feet
had
been
shod
with
steel
those
sharp
rocks
would
have
cut
through
starting
early
we
made
the
summit
about
noon
and
from
here
we
could
see
the
place
where
we
found
a
water
hole
and
camped
the
first
night
after
we
left
the
wagons
down
the
steep
cañon
we
turned
the
same
one
in
which
we
had
turned
back
with
the
wagons
and
over
the
sharp
broken
pieces
of
volcanic
rock
that
formed
our
only
footing
we
hobbled
along
with
sore
and
tender
feet
we
had
to
watch
for
the
smoothest
place
for
every
step
and
then
moved
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
the
indians
could
have
caught
us
easily
if
they
had
been
around
for
we
must
keep
our
eyes
on
the
ground
constantly
and
stop
if
we
looked
up
and
around
but
we
at
last
got
down
and
camped
on
some
spot
where
we
had
set
out
days
before
to
seek
the
settlements
here
was
the
same
little
water
hole
in
the
sand
plain
and
the
same
strong
sulphur
water
which
we
had
to
drink
the
day
we
left
the
mule
was
turned
loose
dragging
the
same
piece
of
rawhide
she
had
attached
to
her
when
we
purchased
her
and
she
ranged
and
searched
faithfully
for
food
finding
little
except
the
very
scattering
bunches
of
sage
brush
she
was
industrious
and
walked
around
rapidly
picking
here
and
there
but
at
dark
came
into
camp
and
lay
down
close
to
us
to
sleep
there
was
no
sign
that
any
one
had
been
here
during
our
absence
and
if
the
people
had
gone
to
hunt
a
way
out
they
must
either
have
followed
the
jayhawker
trail
or
some
other
one
we
were
much
afraid
that
they
might
have
fallen
victims
to
the
indians
remaining
in
camp
so
long
it
was
quite
likely
they
had
been
discovered
by
them
and
it
was
quite
likely
they
had
been
murdered
for
the
sake
of
the
oxen
and
camp
equipage
it
might
be
that
we
should
find
the
hostiles
waiting
for
us
when
we
reached
the
appointed
camping
place
and
it
was
small
show
for
two
against
a
party
our
mule
and
her
load
would
be
a
great
capture
for
them
we
talked
a
great
deal
and
said
a
great
many
things
at
that
camp
fire
for
we
knew
we
were
in
great
danger
and
we
had
many
doubts
about
the
safety
of
our
people
that
would
soon
be
decided
and
whether
for
joy
or
sorrow
we
could
not
tell
from
this
place
as
we
walked
along
we
had
a
wagon
road
to
follow
in
soft
sand
but
not
a
sign
of
a
human
footstep
could
we
see
as
we
marched
toward
this
the
camp
of
the
last
hope
we
had
the
greatest
fears
the
people
had
given
up
our
return
and
started
out
for
themselves
and
that
we
should
follow
on
only
to
find
them
dead
or
dying
my
pen
fails
me
as
i
try
to
tell
the
feelings
and
thoughts
of
this
trying
hour
i
can
never
hope
to
do
so
but
if
the
reader
can
place
himself
in
my
place
his
imagination
can
not
form
a
picture
that
shall
go
beyond
reality
we
were
some
seven
or
eight
miles
along
the
road
when
i
stopped
to
fix
my
moccasin
while
rogers
went
slowly
along
the
little
mule
went
on
ahead
of
both
of
us
searching
all
around
for
little
bunches
of
dry
grass
but
always
came
back
to
the
trail
again
and
gave
us
no
trouble
when
i
had
started
up
again
i
saw
rogers
ahead
leaning
on
his
gun
and
waiting
for
me
apparently
looking
at
something
on
the
ground
as
i
came
near
enough
to
speak
i
asked
what
he
had
found
and
he
said
here
is
capt
culverwell
dead
he
did
not
look
much
like
a
dead
man
he
lay
upon
his
back
with
arms
extended
wide
and
his
little
canteen
made
of
two
powder
flasks
lying
by
his
side
this
looked
indeed
as
if
some
of
our
saddest
forebodings
were
coming
true
how
many
more
bodies
should
we
find
or
should
we
find
the
camp
deserted
and
never
find
a
trace
of
the
former
occupants
we
marched
toward
camp
like
two
indians
silent
and
alert
looking
out
for
dead
bodies
and
live
indians
for
really
we
more
expected
to
find
the
camp
devastated
by
those
rascals
than
to
find
that
it
still
contained
our
friends
to
the
east
we
could
plainly
see
what
seemed
to
be
a
large
salt
lake
with
a
bed
that
looked
as
if
of
the
finest
whitest
sand
but
really
a
wonder
of
salt
crystal
we
put
the
dreary
steps
steadily
one
forward
of
another
the
little
mule
the
only
unconcerned
one
of
the
party
ever
looking
for
an
odd
blade
of
grass
dried
in
the
hot
dry
wind
but
yet
retaining
nourishment
which
she
preferred
about
noon
we
came
in
sight
of
the
wagons
still
a
long
way
off
but
in
the
clear
air
we
could
make
them
out
and
tell
what
they
were
without
being
able
to
see
anything
more
half
a
mile
was
the
distance
between
us
and
the
camp
before
we
could
see
very
plainly
as
they
were
in
a
little
depression
we
could
see
the
covers
had
been
taken
off
and
this
was
an
ominous
sort
of
circumstance
to
us
for
we
feared
the
depredations
of
the
indians
in
retaliation
for
the
capture
of
their
squashes
they
had
shot
our
oxen
before
we
left
and
they
have
slain
them
this
time
and
the
people
too
we
surely
left
seven
wagons
now
we
could
see
only
four
and
nowhere
the
sign
of
an
ox
they
must
have
gone
ahead
with
a
small
train
and
left
these
four
standing
after
dismantling
them
no
signs
of
life
were
anywhere
about
and
the
thought
of
our
hard
struggles
between
life
and
death
to
go
out
and
return
with
the
fruitless
results
that
now
seemed
apparent
was
almost
more
than
human
heart
could
bear
when
should
we
know
their
fate
when
should
we
find
their
remains
and
how
learn
of
their
sad
history
if
we
ourselves
should
live
to
get
back
again
to
settlements
and
life
if
ever
two
men
were
troubled
rogers
and
i
surely
passed
through
the
furnace
we
kept
as
low
and
as
much
out
of
sight
as
possible
trusting
very
much
to
the
little
mule
that
was
ahead
for
we
felt
sure
she
would
detect
danger
in
the
air
sooner
than
we
and
we
watched
her
closely
to
see
how
she
acted
she
slowly
walked
along
looking
out
for
food
and
we
followed
a
little
way
behind
but
still
no
decisive
sign
to
settle
the
awful
suspense
in
which
we
lived
and
suffered
we
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
they
had
taken
the
trail
of
the
jayhawkers
and
we
had
missed
them
on
the
road
or
they
had
perished
before
reaching
the
place
where
we
turned
from
their
trail
one
hundred
yards
now
to
the
wagons
and
still
no
sign
of
life
no
positive
sign
of
death
though
we
looked
carefully
for
both
we
fear
that
perhaps
there
are
indians
in
ambush
and
with
nervous
irregular
breathing
we
counsel
what
to
do
finally
rogers
suggested
that
he
had
two
charges
in
his
shot
gun
and
i
seven
in
the
coll
rifle
and
that
i
fire
one
of
mine
and
await
results
before
we
ventured
any
nearer
and
if
there
are
any
of
the
red
devils
there
we
can
kill
some
of
them
before
they
get
to
us
and
now
both
closely
watching
the
wagons
i
fired
the
shot
still
as
death
and
not
a
move
for
a
moment
and
then
as
if
by
magic
a
man
came
out
from
under
a
wagon
and
stood
up
looking
all
around
for
he
did
not
see
us
then
he
threw
up
his
arms
high
over
his
head
and
shouted
the
boys
have
come
the
boys
have
come
then
other
bare
heads
appeared
and
bennett
and
wife
and
arcane
came
toward
us
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
the
great
suspense
was
over
and
our
hearts
were
first
in
our
mouths
and
then
the
blood
all
went
away
and
left
us
almost
fainting
as
we
stood
and
tried
to
step
some
were
safe
perhaps
all
of
those
nearest
us
and
the
dark
shadow
of
death
that
had
hovered
over
us
and
cast
what
seemed
a
pall
upon
every
thought
and
action
was
lifted
and
fell
away
a
heavy
oppression
gone
bennett
and
arcane
caught
us
in
their
arms
and
embraced
us
with
all
their
strength
and
bennett
when
she
came
fell
down
on
her
knees
and
clung
to
me
like
a
maniac
in
the
great
emotion
that
came
to
her
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
if
they
had
been
strong
enough
they
would
have
carried
us
to
camp
upon
their
shoulders
as
it
was
they
stopped
two
or
three
times
and
turned
as
if
to
speak
but
there
was
too
much
feeling
for
words
convulsive
weeping
would
choke
the
voice
all
were
a
little
calmer
soon
and
bennett
soon
found
voice
to
say
i
know
you
have
found
some
place
for
you
have
a
mule
and
bennett
through
her
tears
looked
staringly
at
us
as
she
could
hardly
believe
our
coming
back
was
a
reality
and
then
exclaimed
good
boys
o
you
have
saved
us
all
god
bless
you
forever
such
boys
should
never
die
it
was
some
time
before
they
could
talk
without
weeping
hope
almost
died
within
them
and
now
when
the
first
bright
ray
came
it
almost
turned
reason
from
its
throne
a
brighter
happier
look
came
to
them
than
we
had
seen
and
then
they
plied
us
with
questions
the
first
of
which
was
where
were
you
we
told
them
it
must
be
miles
yet
to
any
part
of
california
where
we
could
live
then
came
the
question
can
we
take
our
wagons
you
will
have
to
walk
was
our
answer
for
no
wagons
could
go
over
that
unbroken
road
that
we
had
traveled
as
rapidly
and
carefully
as
we
could
we
told
them
of
our
journey
and
the
long
distance
between
the
water
holes
that
we
had
lost
no
time
and
yet
had
been
twenty
six
days
on
the
road
that
for
a
long
distance
the
country
was
about
as
dry
and
desolate
as
the
region
we
had
crossed
east
of
this
camp
we
told
them
of
the
scarcity
of
grass
and
all
the
reasons
that
had
kept
us
so
long
away
from
them
we
inquired
after
the
others
whom
we
had
left
in
camp
when
we
went
away
and
we
were
told
all
they
knew
about
them
hardly
were
we
gone
before
they
began
to
talk
about
the
state
of
affairs
which
existed
they
said
that
as
they
had
nothing
to
live
on
but
their
oxen
it
would
be
certain
death
to
wait
here
and
eat
them
up
and
that
it
would
be
much
better
to
move
on
a
little
every
day
and
get
nearer
and
nearer
the
goal
before
the
food
failed
bennett
told
them
they
would
know
surely
about
the
way
when
the
boys
returned
and
knowing
the
road
would
know
how
to
manage
and
what
to
expect
and
work
for
and
could
get
out
successfully
but
the
general
opinion
of
all
but
bennett
and
arcane
and
their
families
was
as
expressed
by
one
of
them
if
those
boys
ever
get
out
of
this
cussed
hole
they
are
d
d
fools
if
they
ever
come
back
to
help
anybody
some
did
not
stay
more
than
a
week
after
we
were
gone
but
took
their
oxen
and
blankets
and
started
on
they
could
not
be
content
to
stay
idly
in
camp
with
nothing
to
occupy
their
minds
or
bodies
they
could
see
that
an
ox
when
killed
would
feed
them
only
a
few
days
and
that
they
could
not
live
long
on
them
and
it
stood
them
in
hand
to
get
nearer
the
western
shore
as
the
less
distance
the
more
hope
while
the
meat
lasted
bennett
implored
them
to
stay
as
he
was
sure
we
would
come
back
and
if
the
most
of
them
deserted
him
he
would
be
exposed
to
the
danger
of
the
indians
with
no
hope
of
a
successful
resistance
against
them
but
the
most
seemed
to
think
that
to
stay
was
to
die
and
it
would
be
better
to
die
trying
to
escape
than
to
set
idly
down
to
perish
these
men
seemed
to
think
their
first
duty
was
to
save
themselves
and
if
fortunate
help
others
afterward
so
they
packed
their
oxen
and
left
in
separate
parties
the
last
some
two
weeks
before
they
said
that
capt
culverwell
went
with
the
last
party
i
afterward
learned
that
he
could
not
keep
up
with
them
and
turned
to
go
back
to
the
wagons
again
and
perished
stretched
out
upon
the
sand
as
we
saw
him
dying
all
alone
with
no
one
to
transmit
his
last
words
to
family
or
friends
not
a
morsel
to
eat
and
the
little
canteen
by
his
side
empty
a
sad
and
lonely
death
indeed
there
was
no
end
to
the
questions
about
the
road
we
had
to
answer
for
this
was
uppermost
on
their
minds
and
we
tried
to
tell
them
and
show
them
how
we
must
get
along
on
our
return
we
told
them
of
the
great
snow
mountains
we
had
seen
all
to
the
north
of
our
road
and
how
deep
the
snow
appeared
to
be
and
how
far
west
it
extended
we
told
them
of
the
black
and
desolate
ranges
and
buttes
to
the
south
and
of
the
great
dry
plains
in
the
same
direction
we
told
them
of
the
jayhawkers
trail
of
fish
dead
body
of
the
salt
lake
and
slippery
alkali
water
to
which
we
walked
only
to
turn
away
in
disappointment
of
the
little
sheets
of
ice
which
saved
our
lives
of
doty
camp
and
what
we
knew
of
those
gone
before
of
the
discouraged
ones
who
gave
us
their
names
to
send
back
to
friends
of
the
hawk
and
crow
diet
of
my
lameness
of
the
final
coming
out
into
a
beautiful
valley
in
the
midst
of
fat
cattle
and
green
meadows
and
the
trouble
to
get
the
help
arranged
on
account
of
not
knowing
the
language
to
tell
the
people
what
we
needed
they
were
deeply
impressed
that
my
lameness
had
been
a
blessing
in
disguise
or
we
would
have
gone
on
to
the
coast
and
consumed
more
time
than
we
did
in
walking
slowly
to
favor
the
cripple
knee
our
sad
adventures
and
loss
of
the
horses
in
returning
was
sorrowfully
told
and
we
spoke
of
the
provisions
we
had
been
able
to
bring
on
the
little
mule
which
had
clambered
over
the
rocks
like
a
cat
that
we
had
a
little
flour
and
beans
and
some
good
dried
meat
with
fat
on
it
which
we
hoped
would
help
to
eke
out
the
poorer
fare
and
get
them
through
at
last
they
were
so
full
of
compliments
that
we
really
began
to
think
we
had
been
brought
into
the
world
on
purpose
to
assist
some
one
and
the
one
who
could
forecast
all
things
had
directed
us
and
all
our
ways
so
that
we
should
save
those
people
and
bring
them
to
a
better
part
of
god
footstool
where
plenty
might
be
enjoyed
and
the
sorrows
of
the
desert
forgotten
it
was
midnight
before
we
could
get
them
all
satisfied
with
their
knowledge
of
our
experience
illustation
leaving
death
the
manly
party
on
foot
after
leaving
their
wagons
it
was
quite
a
treat
to
us
to
sleep
again
between
good
blankets
arranged
by
a
woman
hand
and
it
was
much
better
resting
than
the
curled
up
cramped
position
we
had
slept
in
while
away
with
only
the
poor
protection
of
the
half
blanket
for
both
of
us
in
nights
that
were
pretty
chilly
we
had
plenty
of
water
here
and
there
being
no
fear
of
the
mule
going
astray
we
turned
her
loose
as
the
party
had
seen
no
indians
during
our
absence
we
did
not
concern
ourselves
much
about
them
at
breakfast
we
cautioned
them
about
eating
too
much
bread
remembering
our
own
experience
in
that
way
they
said
they
had
about
given
up
our
coming
back
a
week
before
and
had
set
about
getting
ready
to
try
to
move
on
themselves
bennett
said
he
was
satisfied
that
they
never
could
have
got
through
alone
after
what
we
had
told
them
of
the
route
and
its
dangers
he
said
he
knew
it
now
that
not
one
of
them
would
have
lived
if
they
had
undertaken
the
journey
alone
without
knowledge
of
the
way
they
had
taken
off
the
covers
of
the
wagons
to
make
them
into
houses
for
the
oxen
so
they
could
be
used
as
pack
animals
the
strong
cloth
had
been
cut
into
narrow
strips
and
well
made
into
breast
straps
and
breeching
for
the
cattle
were
so
poor
and
their
hide
so
loose
it
was
almost
impossible
to
keep
anything
on
their
backs
they
had
emptied
the
feathers
out
of
the
beds
to
get
the
cloth
to
use
and
had
tried
to
do
everything
that
seemed
best
to
do
to
get
along
without
wagons
the
oxen
came
up
for
water
and
the
mule
with
them
they
looked
better
than
when
we
left
but
were
still
poor
they
had
rested
for
some
time
and
might
feel
able
to
go
along
willingly
for
a
few
days
at
least
i
was
handy
with
the
needle
and
helped
them
to
complete
the
harness
for
the
oxen
while
bennett
and
john
went
to
the
lake
to
get
a
supply
of
salt
to
take
along
a
most
necessary
article
with
our
fresh
meat
i
looked
around
a
little
at
our
surroundings
and
could
see
the
snow
still
drifting
over
the
peak
of
the
snowy
mountain
as
we
had
seen
it
farther
east
where
we
were
ourselves
under
the
burning
sun
this
was
now
pretty
near
february
first
or
midwinter
the
eastern
side
of
this
great
mountain
was
too
steep
to
be
ascended
and
no
sign
of
a
tree
could
be
seen
on
the
whole
eastern
slope
the
range
of
mountains
on
the
east
side
of
this
narrow
valley
were
nearly
all
the
volcanic
barren
in
the
extreme
and
the
roughest
of
all
the
mountains
we
had
ever
seen
i
had
now
looked
pretty
thoroughly
and
found
it
to
be
pretty
nearly
a
hundred
miles
long
and
this
was
the
only
camp
i
had
seen
where
water
could
be
had
when
bennet
was
ready
to
show
me
what
to
do
on
the
cloth
harness
we
took
a
seat
under
the
wagon
the
only
shady
place
and
began
work
the
great
mountain
i
have
spoken
of
as
the
snow
mountain
has
since
been
known
as
telescope
peak
reported
to
be
feet
high
it
is
in
the
range
running
north
and
south
and
has
no
other
peak
so
high
bennett
questioned
me
closely
about
the
trip
and
particularly
if
i
had
left
anything
out
which
i
did
not
want
her
to
know
she
said
she
saw
her
chance
to
ride
was
very
slim
and
she
spoke
particularly
of
the
children
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
walk
she
said
little
martha
had
been
very
sick
since
we
had
been
gone
and
that
for
many
days
they
had
expected
her
to
die
they
had
no
medicine
to
relieve
her
and
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
select
the
best
of
the
ox
meat
and
make
a
little
soup
of
it
and
feed
her
they
had
watched
her
carefully
for
many
days
and
nights
expecting
they
would
have
to
part
with
her
any
time
and
bury
her
little
body
in
the
sands
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
her
breath
would
stop
but
they
had
never
failed
in
their
attentions
and
were
at
last
rewarded
by
seeing
her
improve
slowly
and
even
to
relish
a
little
food
so
that
if
no
relapse
set
in
they
had
hopes
to
bring
her
through
they
brought
the
little
one
and
showed
her
to
me
and
she
seemed
so
different
from
what
she
was
when
we
went
away
then
she
could
run
about
camp
climb
out
and
in
the
wagons
and
move
about
so
spry
that
she
reminded
one
of
a
quail
now
she
was
strangely
misshapen
her
limbs
had
lost
all
the
flesh
and
seemed
nothing
but
skin
and
bones
while
her
body
had
grown
corpulent
and
distended
and
her
face
had
a
starved
pinched
and
suffering
look
with
no
healthy
color
in
it
she
told
me
of
their
sufferings
while
we
were
gone
and
said
she
often
dreamed
she
saw
us
suffering
fearfully
for
water
and
lack
of
food
and
could
only
picture
to
herself
as
their
own
fate
that
they
must
leave
the
children
by
the
trail
side
dead
and
one
by
one
drop
out
themselves
in
the
same
way
she
said
she
dreamed
often
of
her
old
home
where
bread
was
plenty
and
then
to
awake
to
find
her
husband
and
children
starving
was
a
severe
trial
indeed
and
the
contrast
terrible
she
was
anxious
to
get
me
to
express
an
opinion
as
to
whether
i
thought
we
could
get
the
oxen
down
the
falls
where
we
had
so
much
trouble
i
talked
to
her
as
encouragingly
as
i
could
but
she
did
not
cheer
up
much
and
sobbed
and
wept
over
her
work
most
all
the
time
it
was
not
possible
to
encourage
her
much
the
outlook
seemed
so
dark
arcane
sat
under
another
wagon
and
said
nothing
but
she
probably
heard
all
we
had
to
say
and
did
not
look
as
if
her
hopes
were
any
brighter
bennett
and
rogers
soon
returned
with
a
supply
of
salt
and
said
the
whole
shore
of
the
lake
was
a
winrow
of
it
that
could
be
shoveled
up
in
enormous
quantities
we
now
in
a
counsel
of
the
whole
talked
over
the
matter
and
the
way
which
seemed
most
promising
if
we
went
by
the
jayhawkers
trail
there
was
a
week
of
solid
travel
to
get
over
the
range
and
back
south
again
as
far
as
a
point
directly
opposite
our
camp
and
this
had
taken
us
only
three
days
to
come
over
as
we
had
come
the
only
obstacle
in
the
way
was
the
falls
and
when
we
explained
that
there
was
some
sand
at
the
bottom
of
them
bennett
said
he
thought
we
could
get
them
over
without
killing
them
and
that
as
we
knew
exactly
where
the
water
was
this
was
the
best
trail
to
take
arcane
was
quite
of
the
same
opinion
the
saving
of
a
week
of
hard
and
tiresome
travel
being
in
each
case
the
deciding
reason
they
then
explained
to
me
what
they
had
decided
on
doing
if
we
had
not
come
back
they
had
selected
two
oxen
for
the
women
to
ride
one
to
carry
water
and
one
to
carry
the
four
children
there
were
no
saddles
but
blankets
enough
to
make
a
soft
seat
and
they
proposed
to
put
a
band
or
belt
around
the
animals
for
them
to
hold
on
by
and
the
blankets
would
be
retained
in
place
by
breast
and
breeching
straps
which
we
had
made
they
had
found
out
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
keep
a
load
of
any
kind
upon
an
ox
and
had
devised
all
this
harness
to
meet
the
trouble
bennett
had
one
old
bridle
ox
called
old
crump
which
had
been
selected
to
carry
the
children
because
he
was
slow
and
steady
how
in
the
world
do
you
expect
it
to
keep
the
children
on
said
i
well
said
bennett
with
a
sort
of
comical
air
about
the
first
relief
from
the
sad
line
of
thought
that
had
possessed
us
all
we
have
taken
two
strong
hickory
shirts
turned
the
sleeves
inside
sewed
up
the
necks
then
sewed
the
two
shirts
together
by
the
tail
and
when
these
are
placed
on
the
ox
they
will
make
two
pockets
for
the
youngest
children
and
we
think
the
two
others
will
be
able
to
cling
to
his
back
with
the
help
of
a
band
around
the
body
of
the
ox
to
which
they
can
cling
to
with
their
hands
now
if
old
crump
went
steady
and
did
not
kick
up
and
scatter
things
he
thought
this
plan
would
operate
first
rate
now
as
to
the
mule
they
proposed
as
we
knew
how
to
pack
the
animal
that
we
should
use
her
to
pack
our
provisions
so
they
would
go
safe
from
a
piece
of
hide
yet
remaining
john
and
i
made
ourselves
some
new
moccasins
and
were
all
ready
to
try
the
trip
over
our
old
trail
for
now
the
third
time
and
the
last
we
hoped
bennett
and
arcane
had
taken
our
advice
and
in
cooking
had
not
put
too
much
of
the
flour
or
beans
into
the
soup
for
the
children
and
they
had
gotten
along
nicely
and
even
began
to
smile
a
little
with
satisfaction
after
a
full
meal
they
got
along
better
than
john
and
i
did
when
we
got
hold
of
the
first
nutritions
after
our
arrival
on
the
other
side
we
must
leave
everything
here
we
can
get
along
without
no
clothing
except
that
on
our
backs
only
a
camp
kettle
in
which
to
make
soup
a
tin
cup
for
each
one
and
some
knives
and
spoons
which
each
happen
to
have
each
one
had
some
sort
of
a
canteen
for
water
which
we
must
fill
up
at
every
opportunity
and
we
decided
to
carry
a
shovel
along
so
we
might
bury
the
body
of
capt
culverwell
and
shovel
up
a
pile
of
sand
at
the
falls
to
enable
us
to
get
the
oxen
over
every
ox
had
a
cloth
halter
on
his
head
so
he
might
be
led
or
tied
up
at
night
when
we
had
a
dry
camp
and
they
would
most
assuredly
wander
off
if
not
secured
old
crump
was
chosen
to
lead
the
train
and
rogers
was
to
lead
him
we
had
made
an
extra
halter
for
this
old
fellow
and
quite
a
long
strip
of
bed
ticking
sewed
into
a
strap
to
lead
him
by
this
packing
business
was
a
new
idea
and
a
hard
matter
to
get
anything
firmly
fixed
on
their
backs
we
had
made
shoulder
straps
hip
straps
breast
straps
and
breeching
as
the
correct
idea
for
a
harness
the
only
way
we
could
fasten
the
band
around
the
animals
was
for
one
to
get
on
each
side
and
pull
it
as
tight
as
possible
then
tie
a
knot
as
we
had
no
buckles
or
ring
in
our
harness
the
loads
of
the
oxen
consisted
of
blankets
and
bedding
and
a
small
light
tent
of
their
sheeting
about
four
by
six
feet
in
size
we
rose
early
and
worked
hard
till
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
getting
all
things
ready
they
had
been
in
a
state
of
masterly
inactivity
so
long
in
this
one
camp
that
they
were
anxious
to
leave
it
now
forever
only
in
progress
was
there
hope
and
this
was
our
last
and
only
chance
we
must
succeed
or
perish
we
loaded
the
animals
from
the
wagons
and
some
of
the
oxen
seemed
quite
afraid
at
this
new
way
of
carrying
loads
old
crump
was
pretty
steady
and
so
was
the
one
with
the
two
water
kegs
one
on
each
side
but
the
other
oxen
did
not
seem
to
think
they
needed
any
blankets
on
these
warm
days
arcane
was
from
a
city
and
had
fondly
conveyed
thus
far
some
articles
of
finery
of
considerable
value
and
much
prized
she
could
not
be
persuaded
to
leave
them
here
to
deck
the
red
man
wife
and
have
her
go
flirting
over
the
mountains
with
and
as
they
had
little
weight
she
concluded
she
would
wear
them
and
this
perhaps
would
preserve
them
so
she
got
out
her
best
hat
and
trimmed
it
up
with
extra
ribbon
leaving
some
with
quite
long
ends
to
stream
out
behind
arcane
brought
up
his
ox
old
brigham
for
he
had
been
purchased
at
salt
lake
and
named
in
honor
of
the
great
mormon
saint
arcane
also
dressed
her
little
boy
charlie
up
in
his
best
suit
of
clothes
for
she
thought
they
might
as
well
wear
them
out
as
to
throw
them
away
she
made
one
think
of
a
fairy
in
gay
and
flying
apparel
in
the
same
way
all
selected
their
best
and
most
serviceable
garments
for
it
was
not
considered
prudent
to
carry
any
load
and
poor
clothes
were
good
enough
to
leave
for
indians
we
set
it
down
as
a
principle
that
we
must
save
ourselves
all
we
could
for
it
would
be
a
close
contested
struggle
with
us
and
death
at
the
very
best
and
we
wanted
to
get
all
the
advantage
for
ourselves
we
could
as
we
were
making
the
preparations
the
women
grew
more
hopeful
as
it
seemed
as
if
something
was
really
going
to
be
accomplished
bennett
and
arcane
were
emphatic
in
their
belief
and
expressions
that
we
would
succeed
i
know
it
do
you
sally
said
bennett
very
cheerfully
but
after
all
bennett
could
not
answer
quite
as
positively
but
said
i
hope
mrs
bennett
maiden
name
was
sarah
dilley
which
i
mention
here
as
i
may
otherwise
forget
it
afterward
she
realized
that
hers
was
no
easy
place
to
ride
that
they
would
have
hard
fare
at
best
and
that
it
must
be
nearly
or
quite
a
month
before
they
could
reach
a
fertile
spot
on
which
to
place
her
feet
one
could
easily
see
that
the
future
looked
quite
a
little
dark
to
her
on
account
of
her
children
as
a
mother
naturally
would
high
overhead
was
the
sun
and
very
warm
indeed
on
that
day
in
the
fore
part
of
february
when
the
two
children
were
put
on
old
crump
to
see
if
he
would
let
them
ride
the
two
small
children
were
placed
in
the
pockets
on
each
side
face
outward
and
they
could
stand
or
sit
as
they
should
choose
george
and
melissa
were
placed
on
top
and
given
hold
of
the
strap
that
was
to
steady
them
in
their
place
i
now
led
up
bennett
ox
and
bennett
helped
his
wife
to
mount
the
animal
on
whose
back
as
soft
a
seat
as
possible
had
been
constructed
arcane
in
her
ribbons
was
now
helped
to
her
seat
on
the
back
of
old
brigham
and
she
carefully
adjusted
herself
to
position
and
arranged
her
dress
and
ornaments
to
suit
then
took
hold
of
the
strap
that
served
to
hold
on
by
as
there
were
no
bridles
on
these
two
rogers
led
the
march
with
his
ox
bennett
and
i
started
the
others
along
and
arcane
followed
with
old
crump
and
the
children
bennett
and
arcane
took
off
their
hats
and
bade
the
old
camp
good
bye
the
whole
procession
moved
and
we
were
once
more
going
toward
our
journey
end
we
hoped
the
road
was
sandy
and
soft
the
grade
practically
level
and
everything
went
well
for
about
four
miles
when
the
pack
on
one
of
the
oxen
near
the
lead
got
loose
and
and
turned
over
to
one
side
which
he
no
sooner
saw
thus
out
of
position
then
he
tried
to
get
away
from
it
by
moving
sidewise
not
getting
clear
of
the
objectionable
load
in
this
way
he
tried
to
kick
it
off
and
thus
really
got
his
foot
in
it
making
matters
worse
instead
of
better
then
he
began
a
regular
waltz
and
bawled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
in
terror
rogers
tried
to
catch
him
but
his
own
animal
was
so
frisky
that
he
could
not
hold
him
and
do
much
else
and
the
spirit
of
fear
soon
began
to
be
communicated
to
the
others
and
soon
the
whole
train
seemed
to
be
taken
crazy
they
would
jump
up
high
and
then
come
down
sticking
their
fore
feet
as
far
as
possible
into
the
sand
after
which
with
elevated
tails
and
terrible
plunges
would
kick
and
thrash
and
run
till
the
packs
came
off
when
they
stopped
apparently
quite
satisfied
bennett
slipped
off
her
ox
as
quick
as
she
could
grabbed
her
baby
from
the
pocket
on
old
crump
and
shouting
to
melissa
and
george
to
jump
got
her
family
into
safe
position
in
pretty
short
order
arcane
took
his
charley
from
the
other
pocket
and
laid
him
on
the
ground
while
he
devoted
his
own
attention
to
the
animals
arcane
ox
followed
suit
and
waltzed
around
in
the
sand
bawled
at
every
turn
fully
as
bad
as
any
of
the
others
but
arcane
proved
to
be
a
good
rider
and
hard
to
unseat
clinging
desperately
to
her
strap
as
she
was
tossed
up
and
down
and
whirled
about
at
a
rate
enough
to
to
make
any
one
dizzy
her
many
fine
ribbons
flew
out
behind
like
the
streamers
from
a
and
the
many
fancy
fixin
she
had
donned
fluttered
in
the
air
in
gayest
mockery
eventually
she
was
thrown
however
but
without
the
least
injury
to
herself
but
somewhat
disordered
in
raiment
when
i
saw
bennett
he
was
standing
half
bent
over
laughing
in
almost
hysterical
convulsion
at
the
entirely
impromptu
circus
which
had
so
suddenly
performed
an
act
not
on
the
program
arcane
was
much
pleased
and
laughed
heartily
when
he
saw
no
one
was
hurt
we
did
not
think
the
cattle
had
so
much
life
and
so
little
sense
as
to
waste
their
energies
so
uselessly
the
little
mule
stepped
out
one
side
and
looked
on
in
amazement
with
out
disarranging
any
article
of
her
load
bennett
carrying
her
baby
and
walking
around
to
keep
out
of
the
way
got
very
much
exhausted
and
sat
down
on
the
sand
her
face
as
red
as
if
the
blood
were
about
to
burst
through
the
skin
and
perspiring
freely
we
carried
a
blanket
and
spread
down
for
her
while
we
gathered
in
the
scattered
baggage
then
the
oxen
were
got
together
again
and
submitted
to
being
loaded
up
again
as
quietly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
myself
and
the
women
had
to
mend
the
harness
considerably
and
arcane
and
his
ox
went
back
for
some
water
while
rogers
and
bennett
took
the
shovel
and
went
ahead
about
a
mile
to
cover
up
the
body
of
capt
culverwell
for
some
of
the
party
feared
the
cattle
might
be
terrified
at
seeing
it
all
this
took
so
much
time
that
we
had
to
make
a
camp
of
it
right
here
we
put
the
camp
kettle
on
two
stones
built
a
fire
put
in
some
beans
and
dried
meat
cut
very
fine
which
cooked
till
arcane
came
with
more
water
which
was
added
and
thickened
with
a
little
of
the
unbolted
flour
making
a
pretty
good
and
nutritious
soup
which
we
all
enjoyed
we
had
to
secure
the
animals
for
there
was
neither
grass
nor
water
for
them
and
we
thought
they
might
not
be
in
so
good
spirits
another
day
we
had
little
trouble
in
packing
up
again
in
the
morning
and
concluded
to
take
a
nearer
route
to
the
summit
so
as
to
more
quickly
reach
the
water
holes
where
rogers
and
i
camped
on
our
first
trip
over
the
country
this
would
be
a
hard
rocky
road
on
its
course
leading
up
a
small
rocky
cañon
hard
on
the
feet
of
the
oxen
so
they
had
to
be
constantly
urged
on
as
they
seemed
very
tender
footed
they
showed
no
disposition
to
go
on
a
spree
again
and
so
far
as
keeping
the
loads
on
behaved
very
well
indeed
the
women
did
not
attempt
to
ride
but
followed
on
close
after
old
crump
and
the
children
who
required
almost
constant
attention
for
in
their
cramped
position
they
made
many
cries
and
complaints
to
think
of
it
two
children
cramped
up
in
narrow
pockets
in
which
they
could
not
turn
around
jolted
and
pitched
around
over
the
rough
road
made
them
objects
of
great
suffering
to
themselves
and
anxiety
and
labor
on
the
part
of
the
mothers
bennett
said
she
would
carry
her
baby
if
she
could
but
her
own
body
was
so
heavy
for
her
strength
that
she
could
not
do
it
bennett
rogers
and
myself
hurried
the
oxen
all
we
could
so
that
we
could
reach
the
water
and
let
bennett
go
back
with
some
to
meet
the
rest
and
refresh
them
for
the
end
of
the
day
march
and
he
could
take
poor
little
martha
from
the
pocket
and
carry
her
in
his
arms
which
would
be
a
great
relief
to
her
arcane
also
took
his
child
when
he
met
them
throwing
away
his
double
barrel
gun
saying
i
have
no
use
for
you
when
the
women
reached
camp
we
had
blankets
already
spread
down
for
them
on
which
they
cast
themselves
so
tired
as
to
be
nearly
dead
they
were
so
tired
and
discouraged
they
were
ready
to
die
for
they
felt
they
could
not
endure
many
days
like
this
we
told
them
this
was
the
first
day
and
they
were
not
used
to
exercise
therefore
more
easily
tired
than
after
they
became
a
little
used
to
it
we
told
them
not
to
be
discouraged
for
we
knew
every
water
hole
and
all
the
road
over
which
we
would
pilot
them
safely
they
would
not
consent
to
try
riding
again
after
their
circus
experience
and
arcane
said
her
limbs
ached
so
much
she
did
not
think
she
could
even
go
on
the
next
day
they
had
climbed
over
the
rocks
all
day
and
were
lame
and
sore
and
truly
thought
they
could
not
endure
such
another
day
the
trail
had
been
more
like
stairs
than
a
road
in
its
steep
ascent
and
our
camp
was
at
a
narrow
pass
in
the
range
the
sky
was
clear
and
cloudless
as
it
had
been
for
so
long
for
thus
far
upon
this
route
no
rain
had
fallen
and
only
once
a
little
snow
that
came
to
us
like
manna
in
the
desert
for
many
days
we
had
been
obliged
to
go
without
water
both
we
and
our
cattle
and
over
the
route
we
had
come
we
had
not
seen
any
signs
of
a
white
man
presence
older
than
our
own
i
have
no
doubt
we
were
the
first
to
cross
the
valley
in
this
location
a
visible
sink
hole
in
the
desert
the
women
did
not
recover
sufficient
energy
to
remove
their
clothing
but
slept
as
they
were
and
sat
up
and
looked
around
with
uncombed
hair
in
the
morning
perfect
pictures
of
dejection
we
let
them
rest
as
long
as
we
could
for
their
swollen
eyes
and
stiffened
joints
told
how
sadly
unprepared
they
were
to
go
forward
at
once
the
sun
came
out
early
and
made
it
comfortable
while
a
cool
and
tonic
breeze
came
down
from
the
great
snow
mountain
the
very
thing
to
brace
them
up
after
a
thorough
rest
the
slope
to
the
east
was
soon
met
by
a
high
ridge
and
between
this
and
the
main
mountain
was
a
gentle
slope
scattered
over
with
sage
brush
and
a
few
little
stools
of
bunch
grass
here
and
there
between
this
gave
our
oxen
a
little
food
and
by
dipping
out
the
water
from
the
holes
and
letting
them
fill
up
again
we
managed
to
get
water
for
camp
use
and
to
give
the
animals
nearly
all
they
wanted
while
waiting
for
the
women
bennett
and
arcane
wanted
to
go
out
and
get
a
good
view
of
the
great
snowy
mountain
i
had
told
them
so
much
about
the
best
point
of
view
was
near
our
camp
perhaps
three
or
four
hundred
yards
away
and
i
went
with
them
this
place
where
we
now
stood
was
lower
than
the
mountains
either
north
or
south
but
were
difficult
to
climb
and
gave
a
good
view
in
almost
every
direction
and
there
on
the
back
bone
of
the
ridge
we
had
a
grand
outlook
but
some
parts
of
it
brought
back
doleful
recollections
they
said
they
had
traveled
in
sight
of
that
mountain
for
months
and
seen
many
strange
formations
but
never
one
like
this
as
developed
from
this
point
it
looked
to
be
miles
to
its
base
and
to
the
north
and
west
there
was
a
succession
of
snowy
peaks
that
seemed
to
have
no
end
bennett
and
arcane
said
they
never
before
supposed
america
contained
mountains
so
grand
with
peaks
that
so
nearly
seemed
to
pierce
the
sky
nothing
except
a
bird
could
ever
cross
such
steep
ranges
as
that
one
west
and
south
it
seemed
level
and
low
dark
and
barren
buttes
rose
from
the
plain
but
never
high
enough
to
carry
snow
even
at
this
season
of
the
year
i
pointed
out
to
them
the
route
we
were
to
follow
noting
the
prominent
points
and
it
could
be
traced
for
fully
one
hundred
and
miles
from
the
point
on
which
we
stood
this
plain
with
its
barren
ranges
and
buttes
is
now
known
as
the
mojave
desert
this
part
of
the
view
they
seemed
to
study
over
as
if
to
fix
every
point
and
water
hole
upon
their
memory
we
turned
to
go
to
camp
but
no
one
looked
back
on
the
country
we
had
come
over
since
we
first
made
out
the
distant
snow
peak
now
so
near
us
on
november
the
only
butte
in
this
direction
that
carried
snow
was
the
one
where
we
captured
the
indian
and
where
the
squashes
were
found
the
range
next
east
of
us
across
the
low
valley
was
barren
to
look
upon
as
a
naked
single
rock
there
were
peaks
of
various
heights
and
colors
yellow
blue
firery
red
and
nearly
black
it
looked
as
if
it
might
sometime
have
been
the
center
of
a
mammoth
furnace
i
believe
this
range
is
known
as
the
coffin
mountains
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
earth
enough
in
the
whole
of
it
to
cover
a
coffin
just
as
we
were
ready
to
leave
and
return
to
camp
we
took
off
our
hats
and
then
overlooking
the
scene
of
so
much
trial
suffering
and
death
spoke
the
thought
uppermost
saying
bye
death
valley
then
faced
away
and
made
our
steps
toward
camp
even
after
this
in
speaking
of
this
long
and
narrow
valley
over
which
we
had
crossed
into
its
nearly
central
part
and
on
the
edge
of
which
the
lone
camp
was
made
for
so
many
days
it
was
called
death
valley
many
accounts
have
been
given
to
the
world
as
to
the
origin
of
the
name
and
by
whom
it
was
thus
designated
but
ours
were
the
first
visible
footsteps
and
we
the
party
which
named
it
the
saddest
and
most
dreadful
name
that
came
to
us
first
from
its
memories
chapter
xi
out
of
death
valley
we
surely
were
to
rogers
and
i
the
case
seemed
hopeful
for
we
had
confidence
in
the
road
and
believed
all
would
have
power
to
weather
difficulties
but
the
poor
women
it
is
hard
to
say
what
complaints
and
sorrows
were
not
theirs
they
seemed
to
think
they
stood
at
death
door
and
would
about
as
soon
enter
as
to
take
up
a
farther
march
over
the
black
desolate
mountains
and
dry
plains
before
them
which
they
considered
only
a
dreary
vestibule
to
the
dark
door
after
all
they
even
had
an
idea
that
the
road
was
longer
than
we
told
them
and
they
never
could
live
to
march
so
far
over
the
sandy
rocky
roads
the
first
day
nearly
satisfied
them
that
it
was
no
use
to
try
rogers
and
i
counted
up
the
camps
we
ought
to
reach
each
day
and
in
this
way
could
pretty
near
convince
them
of
time
that
would
be
consumed
in
the
trip
we
encouraged
them
in
every
way
we
could
told
them
we
had
better
get
along
a
little
every
day
and
make
ourselves
a
little
nearer
the
promised
land
and
the
very
exercise
would
soon
make
them
stronger
and
able
to
make
a
full
day
march
john
and
i
told
them
we
felt
in
much
better
spirits
now
than
we
did
when
we
set
out
alone
and
now
that
nothing
but
the
arrows
of
an
indian
could
stop
us
we
said
to
them
we
are
not
going
to
leave
you
two
ladies
out
here
to
die
for
there
is
not
a
sign
of
a
grave
to
put
you
in
and
it
was
a
pretty
tough
place
to
think
of
making
one
we
told
them
of
the
beautiful
flowery
hillsides
over
the
other
side
and
begged
them
to
go
over
there
to
die
as
it
would
be
so
much
better
and
easier
to
perform
the
last
sad
rites
there
instead
of
here
on
the
top
of
the
dismal
mountain
it
seemed
quite
like
a
grim
joke
but
it
produced
a
reaction
that
turned
the
tide
of
thoughts
and
brought
more
courage
we
only
laid
out
the
march
for
this
day
as
far
as
the
falls
and
after
a
little
prepared
to
move
the
cattle
seemed
to
have
quit
their
foolishness
and
they
were
loaded
without
trouble
the
children
fitted
into
the
pockets
better
than
usual
and
the
mothers
with
full
canteens
strapped
across
their
shoulders
picked
out
soft
places
on
which
to
place
their
poor
blistered
feet
at
every
step
they
walked
as
if
they
were
troubled
with
corns
on
every
toe
and
on
their
heels
into
the
bargain
and
each
foot
was
so
badly
affected
that
they
did
not
know
on
which
one
to
limp
but
still
they
moved
and
we
were
once
more
on
our
way
westward
they
often
stopped
to
rest
and
arcane
waited
for
them
with
old
crump
while
they
breathed
and
complained
awhile
and
then
passed
on
again
illustration
the
oxen
get
frisky
the
route
was
first
along
the
foot
of
the
high
peak
over
bare
rocks
and
we
soon
turned
south
somewhat
so
as
to
enter
the
cañon
leading
down
to
the
falls
the
bottom
of
this
was
thick
with
broken
rock
and
the
oxen
limped
and
picked
out
soft
places
about
as
bad
as
the
women
did
a
pair
of
moccasins
would
not
last
long
in
such
rocks
and
we
hoped
to
get
out
of
them
very
soon
rogers
and
i
hurried
along
assisting
arcane
and
his
party
as
much
as
we
could
while
bennett
staid
behind
and
assisted
the
women
as
much
as
possible
taking
their
arms
and
by
this
means
they
also
reached
camp
an
hour
behind
the
rest
a
kettle
of
hot
steaming
soup
and
blankets
all
spread
out
on
which
to
rest
was
the
work
rogers
and
i
had
done
to
prepare
for
them
and
they
sank
down
on
the
beds
completely
exhausted
the
children
cried
some
but
were
soon
pacified
and
were
contented
to
lie
still
a
good
supper
of
hot
soup
made
them
feel
much
better
all
around
the
first
thing
bennett
and
arcane
did
was
to
look
round
and
see
the
situation
at
the
falls
and
see
if
the
obstacle
was
enough
to
stop
our
progress
or
if
we
must
turn
back
and
look
for
a
better
way
they
were
in
some
doubt
about
it
but
concluded
to
try
and
get
the
animals
over
rather
than
to
take
the
time
to
seek
another
pass
which
might
take
a
week
of
time
we
men
all
went
down
to
the
foot
of
the
fall
and
threw
out
all
the
large
rocks
then
piled
up
all
the
sand
we
could
scrape
together
with
the
shovel
till
we
had
quite
a
pile
of
material
that
would
tend
to
break
a
fall
we
arranged
everything
possible
for
a
forced
passage
in
the
morning
and
the
animals
found
a
few
willows
to
browse
and
a
few
bunches
of
grass
here
and
there
which
gave
them
a
little
food
while
the
spring
supplied
them
with
enough
water
to
keep
them
from
suffering
with
thirst
early
in
the
morning
we
took
our
soup
hastily
and
with
ropes
lowered
our
luggage
over
the
small
precipice
then
the
children
and
finally
all
the
ropes
were
combined
to
make
a
single
strong
one
about
thirty
feet
long
they
urged
one
of
the
oxen
up
to
the
edge
of
the
falls
put
the
rope
around
his
horns
and
threw
down
the
end
to
me
whom
they
had
stationed
below
i
was
told
to
pull
hard
when
he
started
so
that
he
might
not
light
on
his
head
and
break
his
neck
we
felt
this
was
a
desperate
undertaking
and
we
fully
expected
to
lose
some
of
our
animals
but
our
case
was
critical
and
we
must
take
some
chances
bennett
stood
on
one
side
of
the
ox
and
arcane
on
the
other
while
big
rogers
was
placed
in
the
rear
to
give
a
regular
tennessee
boost
when
the
word
was
given
now
for
it
said
bennett
and
as
i
braced
out
on
the
rope
those
above
gave
a
push
and
the
ox
came
over
sprawling
but
landed
safely
cut
only
a
little
by
some
angular
stones
in
the
sand
pile
good
enough
said
some
one
and
i
threw
the
rope
back
for
another
ox
we
get
all
over
safely
said
arcane
if
lewis
down
there
will
keep
them
from
getting
their
necks
broken
lewis
pulled
hard
every
time
and
not
a
neck
was
broken
the
sand
pile
was
renewed
every
time
and
made
as
high
and
soft
as
possible
and
very
soon
all
our
animals
were
below
the
falls
the
little
mule
gave
a
jump
when
they
pushed
her
and
lighted
squarely
on
her
feet
all
right
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
slight
cuts
which
bled
some
the
oxen
were
all
right
and
we
began
loading
them
at
once
bennett
and
arcane
assisted
their
wives
down
along
the
little
narrow
ledge
which
we
used
in
getting
up
keeping
their
faces
toward
the
rocky
wall
and
feeling
carefully
for
every
footstep
thus
they
worked
along
and
landed
safely
by
the
time
we
had
the
animals
ready
for
a
march
we
had
passed
without
disaster
the
obstacle
we
most
feared
and
started
down
the
rough
cañon
hope
revived
and
we
felt
we
should
get
through
after
winding
around
among
the
great
boulders
for
a
little
while
we
came
to
the
two
horses
we
had
left
behind
both
dead
and
near
together
we
pointed
to
the
carcasses
and
told
them
those
were
the
horses
we
brought
for
the
women
to
ride
and
that
is
the
way
they
were
cheated
out
of
their
passage
the
bodies
of
the
animals
had
not
been
touched
by
bird
or
beast
the
cañon
was
too
deep
and
dark
for
either
wolves
or
buzzards
to
enter
and
nothing
alive
had
been
seen
by
us
in
the
shape
of
wild
game
of
any
sort
firearms
were
useless
here
except
for
defence
against
indians
and
we
expected
no
real
trouble
from
them
from
what
we
could
see
it
was
my
opinion
that
no
general
rain
ever
fell
in
that
region
there
was
some
evidence
that
water
had
at
times
flowed
down
them
freely
after
cloud
bursts
or
some
sudden
tempest
but
the
gravel
was
so
little
worn
that
it
gave
no
evidence
of
much
of
a
stream
we
hurried
on
as
rapidly
as
possible
so
as
to
get
into
the
beaten
trail
which
would
be
a
little
easier
to
follow
when
we
reached
the
lowest
part
of
the
valley
we
had
to
turn
south
to
get
around
a
little
slow
running
stream
of
salt
water
that
moved
north
and
emptied
into
a
salt
lake
no
source
of
the
stream
could
be
seen
from
this
point
but
when
we
reached
a
point
where
we
could
cross
we
had
a
smooth
hard
clay
bed
to
march
over
it
seemed
to
have
been
some
day
a
bed
of
mortar
but
now
baked
hard
and
the
hoofs
of
the
oxen
dented
into
it
no
more
than
half
an
inch
on
our
left
hand
was
a
perpendicular
cliff
along
which
we
traveled
for
quite
a
little
way
the
range
of
mountains
now
before
us
to
cross
was
black
nothing
but
rocks
and
extremely
barren
having
no
water
in
it
that
we
knew
of
so
when
we
reached
the
summit
we
camped
tied
all
our
animals
to
rocks
where
they
lay
down
and
did
not
rise
till
morning
the
women
were
so
tired
they
were
over
two
hours
late
and
we
had
the
fire
built
the
soup
cooked
and
the
beds
made
as
we
did
not
stop
at
noon
all
were
very
hungry
and
ate
with
a
relish
the
poor
animals
had
to
go
without
either
grass
or
water
when
old
crump
and
the
party
came
in
the
men
were
carrying
the
babies
and
their
wives
were
clinging
to
their
arms
scarcely
able
to
stand
when
they
reached
the
beds
they
fell
at
full
length
on
them
saying
their
feet
and
limbs
ached
like
the
tooth
ache
it
seemed
to
be
best
for
them
to
rest
a
little
before
eating
bennett
said
that
the
only
consolation
was
that
the
road
was
getting
shorter
every
day
but
were
it
not
for
the
children
she
would
sooner
die
than
follow
the
trail
any
farther
their
soup
was
carried
to
them
in
the
bed
and
they
were
covered
up
as
they
lay
and
slept
till
morning
this
day
walk
was
the
hardest
one
yet
and
probably
the
longest
one
of
the
whole
journey
but
there
was
no
other
place
where
we
could
find
a
place
large
enough
to
make
a
camp
and
free
enough
of
rocks
so
that
a
bed
could
be
made
rogers
and
i
had
the
kettle
boiling
early
and
put
in
the
last
of
the
meat
and
nearly
all
that
was
left
of
the
flour
at
the
next
camp
an
ox
must
be
killed
just
as
it
was
fairly
light
i
went
about
yards
south
where
the
dead
body
of
mr
fish
lay
just
as
he
died
more
than
a
month
before
the
body
had
not
been
disturbed
and
looked
quite
natural
he
was
from
oscaloosa
iowa
the
folks
arose
very
reluctantly
this
morning
and
appeared
with
swollen
eyes
and
uncombed
hair
for
there
was
no
means
of
making
a
toilet
without
a
drop
of
water
except
what
we
had
used
in
getting
breakfast
we
set
the
soup
kettle
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
so
the
women
could
feed
the
children
and
themselves
now
as
we
loaded
the
oxen
it
was
agreed
that
rogers
and
i
should
go
ahead
with
all
but
old
crump
and
get
in
camp
as
soon
as
possible
and
they
were
to
follow
on
as
best
they
could
there
was
a
little
water
left
in
the
canteens
of
bennett
and
arcane
to
be
given
only
to
the
children
who
would
cry
when
thirsty
the
very
thing
to
make
them
feel
the
worst
we
were
to
kill
an
ox
when
we
reached
camp
and
as
each
of
the
men
had
an
equal
number
on
the
start
each
was
to
furnish
one
alternately
and
no
disputing
about
whose
were
better
or
stronger
in
any
emergency
our
road
now
led
down
the
western
slope
of
the
mountain
and
loose
hard
broken
rocks
were
harder
on
the
feet
of
our
animals
than
coming
up
and
our
own
moccasins
were
wearing
through
the
cattle
needed
shoes
as
well
as
we
any
one
who
has
never
tried
it
can
imagine
how
hard
it
is
to
walk
with
tender
feet
over
broken
rock
it
was
very
slow
getting
along
at
the
best
and
the
oxen
stumbled
dreadfully
in
trying
to
protect
their
sore
feet
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
we
had
several
miles
of
soft
and
sandy
road
the
sun
shone
very
hot
and
with
no
water
we
suffered
fearfully
a
short
way
out
in
the
sandy
valley
we
pass
again
the
grave
of
isham
where
he
had
been
buried
by
his
friends
he
was
from
rochester
he
was
a
cheerful
pleasant
man
and
during
the
forepart
of
the
journey
used
his
fiddle
at
the
evening
camps
to
increase
the
merriment
of
his
jolly
companions
in
those
days
we
got
no
rain
see
no
living
animals
of
any
kind
except
those
of
our
train
see
not
a
bird
nor
insect
see
nothing
green
except
a
very
stunted
sage
and
some
dwarf
bushes
we
now
know
that
the
winter
of
was
one
of
the
wettest
ever
seen
in
california
but
for
some
reason
or
other
none
of
the
wet
clouds
ever
came
to
this
portion
of
the
state
to
deposit
the
most
scattering
drops
of
moisture
quite
a
long
way
from
the
expected
camp
the
oxen
snuffed
the
moisture
and
began
to
hurry
towards
it
with
increased
speed
a
little
while
before
it
did
not
seem
as
if
they
had
ambition
enough
left
to
make
a
quick
move
but
as
we
approached
the
water
those
which
had
no
packs
fairly
trotted
in
their
haste
to
get
a
drink
this
stream
was
a
very
small
one
seeping
out
from
a
great
pile
of
rocks
and
maintaining
itself
till
it
reached
the
sands
where
it
disappeared
completely
a
few
tufts
of
grass
grew
along
the
banks
otherwise
everything
surrounding
was
desolate
in
the
extreme
as
soon
as
we
could
get
the
harness
off
the
oxen
we
went
to
look
for
our
little
buried
sack
of
wheat
which
we
were
compelled
to
leave
and
hide
on
our
way
out
we
had
hidden
it
so
completely
that
it
took
us
quite
a
little
while
to
strike
its
bed
but
after
scratching
with
our
hands
awhile
we
hit
the
spot
and
found
it
untouched
although
the
sand
in
which
it
was
buried
seemed
quite
dry
yet
the
grain
had
absorbed
so
much
moisture
from
it
that
the
sack
was
nearly
bursting
it
was
emptied
on
a
blanket
and
proved
to
be
still
sound
and
sweet
our
first
work
now
was
to
kill
an
ox
and
get
some
meat
to
cook
for
those
who
were
coming
later
we
got
the
kettle
over
boiling
with
some
of
the
wheat
in
it
for
the
beans
were
all
gone
we
killed
the
ox
saving
the
blood
to
cook
cutting
the
meat
all
off
the
bones
we
had
it
drying
over
a
fire
as
soon
as
possible
except
what
we
needed
for
this
meal
and
the
next
then
we
made
a
smooth
place
in
the
soft
sand
on
which
to
spread
the
blankets
the
first
good
place
we
had
found
to
sleep
since
leaving
death
valley
the
next
job
was
to
make
moccassins
for
ourselves
and
for
the
oxen
for
it
was
plain
they
could
not
go
on
another
day
barefooted
we
kept
busy
indeed
attending
the
fires
under
the
meat
and
under
the
kettle
besides
our
shoemaking
and
were
getting
along
nicely
about
sundown
when
old
christian
crump
appeared
in
sight
followed
by
the
women
and
the
rest
of
the
party
the
women
were
just
as
tired
as
ever
and
dropped
down
on
the
blankets
the
first
thing
how
many
such
days
as
this
can
we
endure
they
said
we
had
them
count
the
days
gone
by
and
look
around
to
see
the
roughest
part
of
the
road
was
now
behind
them
they
said
that
only
five
days
had
passed
and
that
two
thirds
of
the
distance
still
remained
untraveled
and
they
knew
they
could
never
endure
even
another
five
day
work
like
the
last
we
told
them
to
be
brave
and
be
encouraged
for
we
had
been
over
the
road
and
knew
what
it
was
and
that
we
felt
sure
of
being
able
to
do
it
nicely
they
were
fed
in
bed
as
usual
and
there
they
lay
till
morning
we
men
went
to
making
moccasins
from
the
green
hide
and
when
we
had
cut
out
those
for
the
men
and
women
the
balance
of
the
hide
was
used
in
preparing
some
also
for
the
oxen
particularly
the
worst
ones
for
if
i
remember
correctly
there
was
not
enough
to
go
round
the
morning
came
bright
and
pleasant
as
all
of
them
were
and
just
warm
enough
for
comfort
in
the
part
of
the
day
the
women
were
as
usual
and
their
appearance
would
remind
one
quite
strongly
of
hens
which
had
not
been
long
out
of
trouble
hair
snarled
eyes
red
nose
swollen
and
out
of
fix
generally
they
did
not
sleep
well
so
much
fatigued
for
they
said
they
lived
over
their
hard
days
in
dreams
at
night
and
when
they
would
close
their
eyes
and
try
to
go
to
sleep
the
visions
would
seem
to
come
to
them
half
waking
and
they
could
not
rest
there
was
now
before
us
a
particularly
bad
stretch
of
the
country
as
it
would
probably
take
us
four
or
five
days
to
get
over
it
and
there
was
only
one
water
hole
in
the
entire
distance
this
one
was
quite
salt
so
much
so
that
on
our
return
trip
the
horses
refused
to
drink
it
and
the
little
white
one
died
next
day
only
water
for
one
day
camp
could
be
carried
with
us
and
that
was
for
ourselves
alone
and
not
for
the
animals
when
the
moccasins
were
finished
in
the
morning
we
began
to
get
our
cattle
together
when
it
was
discovered
that
old
brigham
was
gone
and
the
general
belief
was
that
the
indians
had
made
a
quiet
raid
on
us
and
got
away
with
the
old
fellow
we
circled
around
till
we
found
his
track
and
then
arcane
followed
it
while
we
made
ready
the
others
arcane
came
in
with
the
stray
namesake
of
the
polygamous
saint
about
this
time
shouting
i
got
him
no
indians
the
ox
had
got
into
the
wash
ravine
below
camp
and
passed
out
of
sight
behind
in
a
short
time
he
had
been
as
easily
tracked
as
if
he
walked
in
snow
there
was
larger
sage
brush
in
the
wash
than
elsewhere
and
no
doubt
brigham
had
thought
this
a
good
place
to
seek
for
some
extra
blades
of
grass
immediately
south
of
this
camp
now
known
as
providence
springs
is
the
salt
lake
to
which
rogers
and
i
went
on
the
first
trip
and
were
so
sadly
disappointed
in
finding
the
water
unfit
to
use
as
soon
as
ready
we
started
up
the
cañon
following
the
trail
made
by
the
jayhawkers
who
had
proceeded
us
and
by
night
had
reached
the
summit
but
passed
beyond
a
short
distance
down
the
western
slope
where
we
camped
in
a
valley
that
gave
us
good
large
sage
brush
for
our
fires
and
quite
a
range
for
the
oxen
without
their
getting
out
of
sight
this
being
at
quite
a
high
elevation
we
could
see
the
foot
as
well
as
the
top
of
the
great
snow
mountain
and
had
a
general
good
view
of
the
country
this
proved
to
be
the
easiest
day
march
we
had
experienced
and
the
women
complained
less
than
on
any
other
night
since
our
departure
their
path
had
been
comparatively
smooth
and
with
the
new
moccasins
their
feet
had
been
well
protected
they
had
come
through
pretty
nicely
we
told
them
they
looked
better
and
if
they
would
only
keep
up
good
courage
they
would
succeed
and
come
out
all
right
to
the
land
where
there
was
plenty
of
bread
and
water
and
when
safely
out
they
might
make
good
resolutions
never
to
get
in
such
a
trap
again
bennett
said
such
a
trip
could
never
be
done
over
again
and
but
for
the
fact
that
rogers
and
i
had
been
over
the
road
and
that
she
believed
all
we
had
said
about
it
she
never
would
have
had
the
courage
to
come
thus
far
now
for
the
children
sake
she
wished
to
live
and
would
put
forth
any
effort
to
come
through
all
right
the
next
day
we
had
a
long
cañon
to
go
down
and
in
it
passed
the
dead
body
of
the
beautiful
white
mare
rogers
had
taken
such
a
fancy
to
the
body
had
not
decomposed
nor
had
it
been
disturbed
by
any
bird
or
beast
below
this
point
the
bed
of
the
cañon
was
filled
with
great
boulders
over
which
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
the
oxen
along
some
of
them
had
lost
their
moccasins
and
had
to
suffer
terribly
over
the
rocks
camp
was
made
at
the
salt
water
hole
and
our
wheat
and
meat
boiled
in
it
did
not
soften
and
get
tender
as
it
did
in
fresh
water
there
was
plenty
of
salt
grass
above
but
the
oxen
did
not
eat
it
any
more
than
the
horses
did
and
wandered
around
cropping
a
bite
of
the
bitter
brush
once
in
awhile
and
looking
very
sorry
this
was
near
the
place
where
rogers
and
i
found
the
piece
of
ice
which
saved
our
lives
the
women
did
not
seriously
complain
when
we
reached
this
camp
but
little
charley
arcane
broke
out
with
a
bad
looking
rash
all
over
his
body
and
as
he
cried
most
of
the
time
it
no
doubt
smarted
and
pained
him
like
a
mild
burn
neither
his
mother
nor
any
one
else
could
do
anything
for
him
to
give
him
any
relief
we
had
no
medicines
and
if
he
or
any
one
should
die
all
we
could
do
would
be
to
roll
the
body
in
a
blanket
and
cover
it
with
a
light
covering
of
sand
from
this
camp
to
the
next
water
holes
at
the
base
of
the
great
snow
mountain
it
was
at
least
miles
level
as
to
surface
and
with
a
light
ascending
grade
the
jayhawkers
had
made
a
well
marked
trail
and
it
it
was
quite
good
walking
the
next
camp
was
a
dry
one
both
for
ourselves
and
the
oxen
nothing
but
dry
brush
for
them
and
a
little
dried
meat
for
ourselves
but
for
all
this
the
women
did
not
complain
so
very
much
they
were
getting
use
to
the
work
and
grew
stronger
with
the
exercise
they
had
followed
old
crump
and
the
children
every
day
with
the
canteens
of
water
and
a
little
dried
meat
to
give
them
if
they
cried
too
much
with
hunger
and
arcane
had
led
his
ox
day
after
day
with
a
patience
that
was
remarkable
and
there
was
no
bad
temper
shown
by
any
one
this
was
the
way
to
do
for
if
there
were
any
differences
there
was
no
tribunal
to
settle
them
by
in
all
this
desert
travel
i
did
not
hear
any
discontent
and
serious
complaint
except
in
one
case
and
that
was
at
the
jayhawker
camp
where
they
burned
their
wagons
at
the
end
of
the
wagon
road
in
death
valley
some
could
not
say
words
bad
enough
to
express
their
contempt
and
laid
all
the
trouble
of
salt
water
to
lot
wife
perhaps
she
was
in
a
better
position
to
stand
the
cursing
than
any
of
the
party
present
the
next
day
we
reached
the
water
holes
at
the
place
where
rogers
and
i
stole
up
to
camp
fire
in
the
evening
supposing
it
to
be
indians
but
finding
there
capt
doty
and
his
mess
a
part
of
the
jayhawker
band
by
dipping
carefully
from
these
holes
they
filled
again
and
thus
although
there
was
no
flow
from
them
we
gradually
secured
what
water
we
needed
for
the
camp
which
was
a
small
amount
after
so
long
a
time
without
there
was
some
low
brush
here
called
greasewood
which
grew
about
as
high
as
currant
bushes
and
some
distance
up
the
mountain
the
oxen
could
find
some
scattery
bunch
grass
which
on
the
whole
made
this
camp
a
pretty
good
one
the
women
however
were
pretty
nearly
exhausted
and
little
charley
arcane
cried
bitterly
all
day
and
almost
all
night
all
began
to
talk
more
and
feel
more
hopeful
of
getting
through
the
women
began
to
say
that
every
step
brought
them
so
much
nearer
to
the
house
we
had
told
them
about
on
the
other
side
and
often
said
the
work
was
not
so
very
hard
after
all
really
it
was
not
so
bad
travelling
as
we
had
at
first
we
were
now
nine
days
from
the
wagons
are
we
half
way
was
the
question
they
began
to
ask
we
had
to
answer
them
that
more
than
one
half
the
hard
days
were
over
if
one
half
the
distance
had
not
been
traveled
and
with
the
better
walking
and
getting
hardened
to
the
work
they
would
get
over
the
last
half
better
than
the
first
one
thing
was
a
little
hard
all
of
our
beans
and
flour
had
been
used
up
and
now
the
wheat
was
about
gone
also
we
had
cooked
it
and
it
seemed
best
trying
to
build
up
our
strength
where
it
was
most
needed
for
the
greatest
trials
and
now
we
thought
they
would
be
able
to
get
along
on
the
meat
we
had
reached
the
base
of
the
great
snow
mountain
it
seems
strange
with
the
mass
of
snow
resting
above
and
which
must
be
continually
thawing
more
or
less
no
ravines
or
large
streams
of
water
were
produced
flowing
down
this
side
it
seemed
dry
all
around
its
base
which
is
is
very
singular
with
the
snow
so
near
we
had
now
our
barren
cañon
to
go
down
and
right
here
was
the
big
trail
coming
down
from
the
north
which
we
took
and
followed
we
said
all
these
good
things
about
the
road
and
encouraged
the
people
all
we
could
to
keep
in
good
spirits
and
keep
moving
we
told
them
we
thought
we
knew
how
to
manage
to
get
them
safe
over
the
road
if
they
only
fully
endeavored
to
do
it
we
were
all
quite
young
and
not
in
the
decline
of
life
as
were
most
of
them
who
had
perished
by
the
way
no
reader
can
fully
realize
how
much
we
had
to
say
and
do
to
keep
up
courage
and
it
is
to
this
more
than
anything
else
that
we
did
which
kept
up
the
lagging
energies
and
inspired
the
best
exertion
i
do
know
but
we
painted
some
things
a
little
brighter
than
they
were
and
tried
to
hide
some
of
the
most
disheartening
points
of
the
prospects
ahead
for
we
found
the
mind
had
most
to
do
with
it
after
all
we
have
no
doubt
that
if
we
had
not
done
all
we
could
to
keep
up
good
courage
the
women
would
have
pined
away
and
died
before
reaching
this
far
whenever
we
stopped
talking
encouragingly
they
seemed
to
get
melancholy
and
blue
there
was
some
pretty
good
management
to
be
exercised
still
the
oxen
were
gradually
growing
weaker
and
we
had
to
kill
the
weakest
one
every
time
for
if
the
transportation
of
our
food
failed
we
should
yet
be
open
to
the
danger
of
starvation
as
it
was
the
meat
on
their
frames
was
very
scarce
and
we
had
to
use
the
greatest
economy
to
make
it
last
and
waste
nothing
we
should
now
have
to
kill
one
of
our
oxen
every
few
days
as
our
other
means
of
subsistence
had
been
so
completely
used
up
the
women
contracted
a
strange
dislike
to
this
region
and
said
they
never
wanted
to
see
any
part
of
it
again
as
the
sun
showed
its
face
over
the
great
sea
of
mountains
away
to
the
east
of
death
valley
and
it
seemed
to
rise
very
early
for
winter
season
we
packed
up
and
started
west
on
the
big
trail
rogers
and
i
took
the
oxen
and
mule
and
went
on
leaving
the
others
to
accompany
old
crump
and
his
little
charges
arcane
had
found
it
best
to
carry
charley
on
his
back
as
it
relieved
the
burning
sensation
caused
by
the
eruption
on
his
skin
which
was
aggravated
by
the
close
quarters
of
the
pockets
thus
leaving
the
pockets
unbalanced
bennett
had
to
carry
his
baby
also
this
made
it
harder
for
them
but
every
one
tried
to
be
just
as
accommodating
as
they
could
and
each
one
would
put
himself
to
trouble
to
accommodate
or
relieve
others
rogers
and
i
made
camp
when
we
reached
the
proper
place
which
was
some
distance
from
the
mountain
on
a
perfectly
level
plain
where
there
was
no
water
no
grass
nothing
but
sage
brush
would
grow
on
the
dry
and
worthless
soil
we
let
the
oxen
go
and
eat
as
much
of
this
as
they
chose
which
was
very
little
and
only
enough
to
keep
them
from
absolute
starvation
the
great
trail
had
a
branch
near
here
that
turned
north
and
went
up
a
ravine
that
would
seem
to
reach
the
snow
in
a
little
while
this
was
believed
to
be
impassable
at
this
time
of
year
this
route
is
known
as
walker
pass
leading
over
a
comparatively
low
ridge
and
coming
out
the
south
fork
of
the
kern
river
we
made
our
camp
here
because
it
was
as
long
a
march
as
the
women
could
make
and
for
a
dry
one
was
as
good
a
location
as
we
could
find
the
cool
breeze
came
down
from
the
snow
to
the
north
of
us
not
so
very
many
miles
away
and
after
a
little
it
became
uncomfortably
cold
we
gathered
greasewood
bushes
and
piled
them
up
to
make
a
for
our
heads
the
oxen
even
would
come
and
stand
around
the
fire
seeming
greatly
to
enjoy
the
warm
smoke
which
came
from
burning
the
greasewood
brush
which
by
the
way
burns
about
the
best
of
any
green
wood
when
we
were
ready
to
lie
down
we
tied
the
animals
to
bunches
of
brush
and
they
lay
contentedly
till
morning
to
the
north
of
us
a
few
miles
away
we
could
see
some
standing
columns
of
rock
much
reminding
one
of
the
great
stone
chimney
of
the
boiler
house
at
stanford
university
not
quite
so
trim
and
regular
in
exterior
appearance
but
something
in
that
order
we
reckon
the
only
students
in
the
vicinity
would
be
lizards
when
the
women
arrived
in
camp
they
were
very
tired
but
encouraged
themselves
that
they
were
much
nearer
the
promised
land
than
they
were
in
the
morning
bennett
said
she
was
very
careful
never
to
take
a
step
backward
and
to
make
every
forward
one
count
as
much
as
possible
that
a
good
resolution
sally
said
mr
bennett
stick
to
it
and
we
will
come
out
by
and
bye
from
near
this
camp
we
have
a
low
range
of
mountains
to
cross
a
sort
of
spur
or
offshoot
of
the
great
snow
mountain
that
reaches
out
twenty
miles
or
more
to
the
southeast
and
its
extremity
divides
away
into
what
seems
from
our
point
of
view
a
level
plain
we
had
attained
quite
an
elevation
without
realizing
it
so
gradual
had
been
the
ascent
and
our
course
was
now
down
a
steep
hillside
and
into
a
deep
cañon
in
its
very
bottom
we
found
a
small
stream
of
water
only
a
few
yards
long
and
then
it
sank
into
the
sands
not
a
spear
of
grass
grew
there
and
if
any
had
grown
it
had
been
eaten
by
the
cattle
which
had
gone
before
this
was
the
same
place
where
rogers
and
i
had
overtaken
the
advance
portion
of
the
jayhawkers
when
we
were
on
our
outward
trip
in
search
of
relief
and
where
some
of
the
older
men
were
so
discouraged
that
they
gave
us
their
home
addresses
in
illinois
so
that
we
could
notify
their
friends
of
their
precarious
situation
and
if
they
were
never
otherwise
heard
from
they
could
be
pretty
sure
they
had
perished
from
thirst
and
starvation
when
almost
at
their
journey
end
the
scenes
of
this
camp
on
that
occasion
made
so
strong
an
impression
on
my
memory
that
i
can
never
forget
it
there
were
poor
dependent
fellows
without
a
morsel
to
eat
except
such
bits
of
poor
meat
as
they
could
beg
from
those
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
own
oxen
their
tearful
pleadings
would
soften
a
heart
of
stone
we
shared
with
some
of
them
even
when
we
did
not
know
the
little
store
upon
our
backs
would
last
us
through
our
oxen
here
had
water
to
drink
but
nothing
more
it
might
be
a
little
more
comfortable
to
drink
and
starve
than
both
choke
and
starve
but
these
are
no
very
pleasant
prospects
in
either
one
both
ourselves
and
the
oxen
were
getting
barefoot
and
our
feet
very
tender
the
hill
we
had
just
come
down
was
very
rough
and
rocky
and
our
progress
very
slow
every
step
made
in
a
selected
spot
we
could
not
stop
here
to
kill
an
ox
and
let
the
remainder
of
them
starve
but
must
push
on
to
where
the
living
ones
could
get
a
little
food
we
fastened
the
oxen
and
the
mule
to
keep
them
from
wandering
and
slept
as
best
we
could
the
women
and
children
looked
worse
than
for
some
time
and
could
not
help
complaining
one
of
the
women
held
up
her
foot
and
the
sole
was
bare
and
blistered
she
said
they
ached
like
toothache
the
women
had
left
their
combs
in
the
wagons
and
their
hair
was
getting
seriously
tangled
their
dresses
were
getting
worn
off
pretty
nearly
to
their
knees
and
showed
the
contact
with
the
ground
that
sometimes
could
not
be
avoided
they
were
in
a
sad
condition
so
far
as
toilet
and
raiment
were
concerned
life
was
in
the
balance
however
and
instead
of
talking
over
sad
things
we
talked
of
the
time
when
we
would
reach
the
little
babbling
brook
where
rogers
and
i
took
such
long
draughts
of
clear
sweet
water
and
the
waiter
at
our
dinner
gave
us
the
choice
of
or
and
where
we
took
a
little
of
all
three
illustation
pulling
the
oxen
down
the
precipice
in
the
morning
we
were
off
again
down
the
cañon
limping
some
as
we
trod
its
coarse
gravelly
bed
with
our
tender
feet
and
stiffened
joints
but
getting
limbered
up
a
little
after
a
bit
and
enduring
it
pretty
well
we
set
out
to
try
to
reach
the
bunch
of
willows
out
on
the
level
plain
where
the
cattle
could
get
some
water
and
grass
but
night
overtook
us
at
the
mouth
of
the
cañon
and
we
were
forced
to
go
into
camp
this
cañon
is
now
called
red
cañon
this
was
on
an
elevated
plain
with
a
lake
near
by
but
as
we
had
been
so
often
deceived
by
going
to
the
lake
for
water
and
finding
them
salt
in
every
instance
or
poison
on
account
of
strong
alkali
we
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
go
and
try
this
one
near
us
was
some
coarse
grass
and
wet
ground
where
we
found
water
enough
for
our
moderate
use
and
the
oxen
by
perseverance
could
get
something
to
eat
and
drink
after
supper
we
were
out
of
meat
and
we
would
have
to
kill
an
ox
to
get
some
food
for
breakfast
in
the
night
a
storm
came
on
much
to
our
surprise
for
we
had
seen
none
since
the
night
on
the
mountain
east
of
death
valley
more
than
two
months
before
we
tried
to
fix
up
a
shelter
to
protect
the
children
and
ourselves
but
were
not
very
successful
we
tried
to
use
our
guns
for
tent
poles
but
could
not
keep
them
in
place
we
laid
down
as
close
as
pigs
in
cold
weather
and
covered
up
as
best
we
could
but
did
not
keep
dry
and
morning
found
us
wet
to
the
skin
cold
and
shivering
we
gathered
big
sage
brush
for
a
fire
in
the
morning
and
the
tracks
of
our
nearly
bare
feet
could
be
plainly
seen
in
the
snow
which
lay
like
a
blanket
awhile
over
the
ground
about
two
inches
deep
some
lay
in
bed
and
we
warmed
blankets
before
the
fire
and
put
over
them
to
keep
them
comfortable
till
the
sun
should
rise
and
warm
the
air
we
selected
an
ox
and
brought
him
up
before
the
fire
where
i
shot
him
and
soon
there
was
meat
roasting
over
the
fire
and
blood
cooking
in
the
camp
kettle
we
had
nothing
to
season
the
blood
pudding
with
but
salt
and
it
was
not
very
good
but
answered
to
sustain
life
we
ate
a
hasty
meal
then
packed
our
animals
and
started
for
the
willow
patch
about
four
miles
away
the
snow
was
about
gone
i
staid
in
camp
to
keep
it
till
they
could
get
through
to
the
willows
and
some
one
to
come
back
with
the
mule
to
carry
forward
the
portion
of
meat
that
could
not
be
taken
at
first
we
intended
to
dry
it
at
the
willows
and
then
we
could
carry
it
along
as
daily
food
over
the
wide
plain
we
had
yet
to
cross
having
carried
the
meat
forward
we
made
a
rack
of
willows
and
dried
it
over
the
fire
making
up
a
lot
of
moccasins
for
the
barefooted
ones
while
we
waited
we
were
over
most
of
the
rocky
road
we
calculated
that
our
shoemaking
would
last
us
through
this
was
a
very
pleasant
camp
the
tired
ones
were
taking
a
rest
no
one
needed
it
more
than
our
women
and
children
who
were
tired
nearly
out
they
were
in
much
better
condition
to
endure
their
daily
hardships
than
when
they
started
out
and
a
little
rest
would
make
them
feel
quite
fresh
again
they
understood
that
this
was
almost
on
the
western
edge
of
this
desert
country
and
this
gave
them
good
hope
and
courage
this
wonderful
spot
in
the
level
plain
with
a
spring
of
pure
water
making
an
oasis
of
green
willows
and
grass
has
been
previously
spoken
of
as
a
spring
of
good
water
and
a
little
willow
patch
in
a
level
desert
away
from
any
hill
in
all
our
wanderings
we
had
never
seen
the
like
before
no
mountaineer
would
ever
think
of
looking
here
for
water
much
less
ever
dream
of
finding
a
lone
spring
away
out
in
the
desert
several
miles
from
the
mountain
base
where
the
range
we
just
came
through
leaves
the
mother
mountain
stands
a
peak
seemingly
alone
and
built
up
of
many
colored
rocks
in
belts
and
the
whole
looks
as
if
tipped
with
steel
arcane
boy
charley
still
suffered
from
his
bogus
measles
or
whatever
else
his
disorder
might
be
and
bennett
little
martha
grew
more
quiet
and
improved
considerably
in
health
though
still
unable
to
walk
and
still
abdominally
corpulent
the
other
two
children
george
and
melissa
seemed
to
bear
up
well
and
loved
to
get
off
and
walk
in
places
where
the
trail
was
smooth
and
level
bennett
arcane
and
old
crump
usually
traveled
with
the
same
party
as
the
women
and
as
each
of
them
had
a
small
canteen
to
carry
water
they
could
attend
to
the
wants
of
the
children
and
keep
them
from
worrying
and
getting
sick
from
fretfulness
they
often
carried
the
two
younger
ones
on
their
backs
to
relieve
and
rest
them
from
their
cramped
position
on
the
ox
arcane
used
to
say
he
expected
the
boys
meaning
rogers
and
i
would
try
to
surprise
the
party
by
letting
them
get
very
near
the
house
before
they
knew
how
near
they
were
be
patient
arcane
said
we
we
can
tell
you
just
how
many
camps
there
must
be
before
we
reach
it
and
we
wo
fool
you
or
surprise
you
in
any
way
well
said
he
i
was
almost
in
hopes
you
would
for
i
like
to
be
disappointed
in
that
way
what
do
you
think
the
folks
will
say
when
we
tell
them
that
our
little
mule
packed
most
of
the
meat
of
an
ox
four
miles
from
one
camp
to
another
what
will
they
say
when
we
tell
them
that
the
oxen
were
so
poor
that
there
was
no
marrow
in
the
great
thigh
bones
instead
of
marrow
there
was
a
thick
dark
liquid
something
like
molasses
in
consistency
but
streaked
with
different
colors
which
made
it
look
very
unwholesome
arcane
said
the
whole
story
was
so
incredible
that
he
never
should
fight
anyone
even
if
he
should
tell
him
he
lied
when
he
related
the
strange
sad
truth
he
said
he
had
no
doubt
many
a
one
would
doubt
their
story
it
was
so
much
beyond
what
people
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
before
and
they
might
be
accused
of
very
strong
romancing
in
the
matter
they
all
felt
more
like
talking
for
we
were
thus
far
safe
and
sound
and
though
there
was
a
desperate
struggle
of
miles
or
more
from
this
place
to
the
next
water
in
the
possibly
the
snow
storms
had
left
a
little
in
some
of
the
pools
but
we
made
no
calculations
on
any
the
promised
land
we
had
so
steadily
been
approaching
and
now
comparatively
so
near
gave
us
great
hope
which
was
better
than
food
and
drink
to
give
us
strength
there
were
surely
two
camps
between
this
and
the
little
pond
john
and
i
found
among
the
cabbage
trees
and
not
more
than
six
by
ten
feet
square
as
we
worked
away
at
our
we
talked
more
in
an
hour
than
we
had
in
a
whole
day
before
we
were
slowly
leaving
death
valley
behind
us
with
its
sad
memories
and
sufferings
we
were
leaving
behind
the
dead
bodies
of
several
who
had
traveled
with
us
and
been
just
as
strong
and
hopeful
as
we
we
had
left
behind
us
all
in
our
possession
in
that
terrible
spot
and
simply
with
our
lives
we
hoped
to
escape
and
trust
to
providence
and
humanity
on
the
other
side
arcane
now
admitted
that
they
could
not
have
got
along
half
as
well
if
we
had
not
gone
ahead
and
looked
out
the
land
it
was
such
a
gain
to
know
exactly
where
the
next
water
hole
was
so
it
could
be
steered
for
and
struggled
toward
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
they
would
have
no
chance
alone
and
that
as
he
now
saw
the
road
he
was
sure
they
have
would
all
perished
even
before
reaching
as
far
as
this
we
had
strong
hopes
of
the
morrow
when
we
would
be
all
rested
all
were
shod
and
would
make
every
footstep
count
in
our
western
progress
it
seems
quite
a
strange
occurrence
that
the
only
two
storms
we
had
had
since
we
turned
westward
on
this
route
were
snow
storms
and
that
both
had
come
while
we
were
asleep
so
that
all
our
days
were
cloudless
sometimes
the
sun
was
uncomfortably
warm
even
in
the
heart
of
the
winter
one
would
have
naturally
expected
that
the
great
rainfall
all
over
the
california
coast
in
the
winter
of
and
the
deep
snows
that
came
in
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
the
same
winter
would
have
extended
southerly
the
few
hundred
miles
that
separated
the
two
places
modern
science
has
shown
the
tracks
of
the
storms
and
partially
explains
the
reasons
for
this
dry
and
barren
nature
of
this
region
when
rains
do
come
they
are
so
out
of
the
regular
order
that
they
are
called
or
waterspouts
and
the
washes
in
the
cañons
and
their
mouths
show
how
great
has
been
the
volume
of
water
that
sometimes
rushed
down
the
slope
if
clouds
at
a
warm
or
moderate
temperature
float
against
these
snow
peaks
all
the
water
they
contain
is
suddenly
precipitated
the
country
is
an
arid
one
and
unless
wealth
should
appear
in
the
shape
of
mines
the
country
can
never
be
inhabited
we
considered
ourselves
very
fortunate
in
finding
the
little
pools
and
holes
of
water
which
kept
us
alive
it
was
not
very
good
drinking
water
but
to
us
thirsty
folks
it
was
a
blessing
and
we
never
passed
it
by
on
account
of
any
little
stagnant
bitter
taste
salt
water
we
could
not
drink
of
course
though
we
sometimes
used
it
to
cook
with
we
were
as
well
prepared
next
morning
as
possible
for
a
move
and
the
long
walk
before
us
the
last
one
between
us
and
the
fertile
land
they
all
talked
of
how
delighted
they
would
be
to
see
once
more
a
running
brook
green
grass
and
trees
and
such
signs
of
life
as
they
had
seen
and
been
used
to
in
the
good
land
they
had
left
behind
the
women
said
they
could
endure
the
march
of
four
or
five
days
if
when
all
over
they
could
sleep
off
the
terrible
fatigue
and
for
once
drink
all
the
pure
sweet
water
they
could
desire
no
more
forced
marches
no
more
grey
road
stretching
out
its
dusty
miles
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
ladies
thought
the
oxen
would
be
as
happy
as
themselves
and
the
little
mule
the
most
patient
one
of
the
whole
train
deserved
a
life
of
ease
for
her
valuable
services
this
little
black
lady
wandered
here
and
there
at
will
seeking
for
grass
but
never
going
astray
or
getting
far
enough
from
the
track
to
alarm
us
in
the
least
she
seldom
drank
much
water
was
always
ready
never
got
and
seemed
made
expressly
for
such
a
life
and
for
such
a
desert
a
good
kettleful
of
soup
for
breakfast
dried
meat
fixed
in
packages
kegs
and
canteens
filled
with
water
and
we
were
ready
for
an
advance
there
is
one
less
ox
to
lead
and
very
little
load
for
those
we
have
still
the
load
is
all
such
poor
weak
fellows
ought
to
bear
old
crump
was
not
thus
favored
by
a
gradually
lightened
load
he
bore
the
same
four
children
every
day
faithfully
carefully
with
never
a
stumble
nor
fall
as
though
fully
aware
of
the
precious
nature
of
his
burden
in
this
new
march
john
and
i
took
the
oxen
and
pushed
on
as
usual
leaving
the
families
to
follow
on
at
a
slower
pace
the
trail
we
made
the
trail
was
slightly
inclined
the
bushes
stunted
at
the
best
getting
smaller
as
we
proceeded
and
the
horse
bones
new
and
ancient
are
now
thickly
scattered
along
the
way
the
soil
is
different
from
that
we
have
had
we
can
see
the
trail
winding
gently
here
and
there
swept
clean
by
the
wind
and
the
surface
is
hard
and
good
but
when
the
mule
gets
the
least
bit
off
of
it
she
sinks
six
inches
deep
into
the
soft
sand
and
the
labor
of
walking
is
immense
i
stepped
out
to
examine
the
peculiar
soil
and
found
it
finer
than
superfine
flour
it
was
evident
that
a
strong
wind
would
lift
it
in
vast
clouds
which
might
even
darken
the
sky
but
we
were
fortunate
in
this
respect
for
during
all
the
time
we
were
on
this
peculiar
soil
there
was
no
wind
at
all
and
we
escaped
a
a
sort
of
storm
as
peculiar
to
this
region
as
are
blizzards
to
some
of
the
states
of
the
great
west
our
first
night
camp
was
out
on
the
barren
waterless
plain
now
known
as
the
mojave
desert
there
were
no
shrubs
large
enough
to
make
a
fire
of
and
nothing
to
tie
our
cattle
to
so
we
fastened
all
our
animals
together
to
keep
them
from
scattering
and
getting
lost
we
ate
a
little
dry
meat
and
drank
sparingly
of
the
water
for
our
scanty
stock
was
to
last
us
another
day
when
we
might
reach
prospective
water
holes
starting
early
john
and
i
took
all
but
old
crump
and
the
other
travelers
and
hurried
on
to
try
and
find
the
water
holes
as
early
as
possible
we
as
well
as
the
oxen
were
very
dry
for
we
left
all
the
water
we
had
with
the
party
for
the
children
for
they
can
not
endure
the
thirst
as
the
older
people
can
we
reached
the
camping
place
before
night
quite
a
time
before
we
reached
it
the
cattle
seemed
to
scent
the
water
and
quickened
their
pace
so
we
were
confident
it
had
not
dried
up
we
got
ahead
of
the
oxen
and
kept
there
until
we
reached
the
little
pond
and
then
guarded
it
to
keep
them
from
wading
into
it
in
their
eagerness
to
reach
some
drink
they
all
satisfied
their
thirst
and
then
we
removed
the
harness
built
a
fire
of
the
dead
cabbage
trees
which
we
found
round
about
laid
down
the
beds
and
arranged
them
neatly
and
had
all
nicely
done
before
the
rear
guard
came
up
in
charge
of
captain
crump
the
party
was
eager
for
water
and
all
secured
it
it
was
rain
water
and
no
doubt
did
not
quench
thirst
as
readily
as
water
from
some
living
spring
or
brook
there
was
evidence
that
there
had
been
a
recent
shower
or
snow
to
fill
this
depression
up
for
our
benefit
the
jayhawkers
had
passed
not
more
than
a
half
mile
north
of
this
spot
but
no
sign
appeared
that
they
had
found
it
and
it
was
left
to
sustain
the
lives
of
the
women
and
children
it
often
occurs
to
me
that
many
may
read
incredulously
when
i
speak
of
our
party
eating
the
entire
flesh
of
an
ox
in
four
or
five
days
to
such
i
will
say
that
one
can
not
form
an
idea
how
poor
an
ox
will
get
when
nearly
starved
so
long
months
had
passed
since
they
had
eaten
a
stomachful
of
good
nutritious
food
the
animals
walked
slowly
with
heads
down
nearly
tripping
themselves
up
with
their
long
swinging
legs
the
skin
loosely
covered
the
bones
but
all
the
flesh
and
muscles
had
shrunk
down
to
the
smallest
space
the
meat
was
tough
and
stringy
as
basswood
bark
and
tasted
strongly
of
bitter
sage
brush
the
cattle
had
eaten
at
almost
every
camp
at
a
dry
camp
the
oxen
would
lie
down
and
grate
their
teeth
but
they
had
no
cud
to
chew
it
looked
almost
merciless
to
shoot
one
down
for
food
but
there
was
no
alternative
we
killed
our
poor
brute
servants
to
save
ourselves
our
cattle
found
a
few
bunches
out
among
the
trees
at
this
camp
and
looked
some
better
in
the
morning
they
had
secured
plenty
of
water
and
some
grass
young
charlie
arcane
seemed
to
grow
worse
rather
than
better
his
whole
body
was
red
as
fire
and
he
screamed
with
the
pain
and
torment
of
the
severe
itching
nothing
could
be
done
to
relieve
him
and
if
his
strength
lasted
till
we
could
get
better
air
water
and
food
he
might
recover
but
his
chances
were
very
poor
not
much
rest
at
this
camp
for
in
the
morning
we
aimed
to
start
early
and
reach
the
water
in
the
foothills
we
thought
we
could
do
it
if
we
started
early
walked
rapidly
and
took
no
resting
spell
at
noon
such
a
poor
soil
as
this
we
were
anxious
to
get
away
from
and
walk
once
more
on
a
soil
that
would
grow
something
besides
stunted
sage
brush
from
all
appearances
the
jayhawkers
were
here
in
about
the
same
predicament
rogers
and
i
were
when
we
lost
the
trail
by
their
tracks
we
could
see
they
had
scattered
wide
and
there
was
no
road
left
for
us
to
follow
and
they
had
evidently
tried
to
follow
our
former
tracks
having
no
trail
to
follow
we
passed
on
as
best
we
could
and
came
to
a
wide
piece
of
land
on
which
were
growing
a
great
many
cabbage
trees
the
soil
was
of
the
finest
dust
with
no
grit
in
it
and
not
long
before
a
light
shower
had
fallen
making
it
very
soft
and
hard
to
get
along
in
with
the
moccasins
the
women
had
to
stop
to
rest
frequently
so
our
progress
was
very
slow
rogers
and
i
had
feet
about
as
hard
as
those
of
the
oxen
so
we
removed
our
moccasins
and
went
barefoot
finding
we
could
get
along
much
easier
in
that
way
but
the
others
had
such
tender
feet
they
could
not
endure
the
rough
contact
with
the
brush
and
mud
only
a
few
miles
had
been
made
before
the
women
were
so
completely
tired
out
that
we
had
to
stop
and
eat
our
little
bit
of
dried
meat
and
wait
till
morning
the
little
mule
now
carried
all
our
stock
of
food
and
the
precious
burden
lightened
every
day
this
delay
was
not
expected
but
we
had
to
endure
it
and
bear
it
patiently
for
there
was
a
limit
to
strength
of
the
feeble
ones
of
our
party
we
had
therefore
to
make
another
barren
camp
relief
seemed
so
near
at
hand
we
kept
good
courage
and
talked
freely
of
the
happy
ending
which
would
soon
come
if
we
had
any
way
to
set
a
good
table
we
would
feast
and
be
merry
like
the
prodigal
son
but
at
any
rate
we
shall
be
safe
if
we
can
reach
the
fertile
shore
when
the
sun
went
down
we
tied
the
mule
and
oxen
to
cabbage
trees
and
shortly
after
dusk
lay
down
ourselves
for
we
had
enjoyed
a
good
fire
made
of
the
trunks
of
cabbage
trees
the
first
really
comfortable
one
in
a
long
time
the
air
was
cooler
here
for
we
were
on
higher
ground
and
there
was
some
snow
on
the
range
of
mountains
before
us
which
sent
these
cool
breezes
down
to
us
a
change
of
climate
quite
pleasing
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
we
had
only
dried
meat
roasted
before
the
fire
without
water
and
when
we
started
each
one
put
a
piece
in
his
or
her
pocket
to
chew
on
during
the
day
as
we
walked
along
as
we
went
ahead
the
ground
grew
dryer
and
the
walking
much
improved
the
morning
overhead
was
perfectly
lovely
as
away
east
across
the
desert
the
sun
early
showed
his
face
to
us
not
a
cloud
anywhere
not
even
over
the
tops
of
the
high
peaks
where
great
white
masses
sometimes
cluster
but
dissolve
as
soon
as
they
float
away
and
there
was
not
wind
enough
to
be
perceptible
we
remarked
the
same
lack
of
animal
life
which
we
had
noticed
on
our
first
passage
over
this
section
seeing
not
a
rabbit
bird
or
living
thing
we
could
use
for
food
bennett
had
the
same
load
in
his
gun
he
put
there
when
we
left
the
wagons
and
all
the
powder
i
had
burned
was
that
used
in
killing
the
oxen
we
had
slain
whenever
it
became
necessary
to
provide
for
our
barren
kitchen
as
we
approached
the
low
the
trail
became
better
travelled
and
better
to
walk
in
for
the
jayhawkers
who
had
scattered
every
one
for
himself
apparently
in
crossing
the
plain
seemed
here
to
have
drawn
together
and
their
path
was
quite
a
beaten
one
we
saw
from
this
that
they
followed
the
tracks
made
by
rogers
and
myself
as
we
made
our
first
trip
westward
in
search
of
bread
quite
a
little
before
the
sun
went
out
of
sight
in
the
west
we
reached
our
camping
place
in
the
lower
hills
at
the
eastern
slope
of
a
range
we
must
soon
cross
here
was
some
standing
water
in
several
large
holes
that
proved
enough
for
our
oxen
and
they
found
some
large
sage
brush
and
small
bushes
round
about
on
which
they
browsed
and
among
which
they
found
a
few
bunches
of
grass
lying
about
were
some
old
skulls
of
cattle
which
had
sometime
been
killed
or
died
these
were
the
first
signs
of
the
sort
we
had
seen
along
this
route
they
might
have
been
killed
by
indians
who
doubtless
used
this
trail
the
next
day
in
crossing
the
range
before
us
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
snow
which
the
sun
had
softened
and
we
dare
not
attempt
to
cross
early
in
the
morning
when
it
was
frozen
hard
the
cattle
could
travel
it
very
well
the
snow
belt
was
five
or
six
miles
wide
and
the
snow
two
or
three
feet
deep
this
was
a
very
good
camping
place
except
that
we
had
to
melt
snow
for
all
our
water
but
this
being
coarse
and
icy
it
was
not
a
great
job
as
we
found
enough
dry
juniper
trees
and
twigs
to
make
a
very
good
fire
here
we
also
had
to
kill
another
ox
this
one
in
its
turn
was
arcane
and
left
him
only
two
and
bennett
three
but
we
think
that
if
we
have
no
accident
we
shall
get
them
along
with
us
till
we
can
get
other
food
as
they
have
very
light
loads
to
pack
when
the
ox
is
killed
and
the
meat
prepared
the
mule
has
for
a
time
a
larger
load
than
all
the
oxen
have
but
seems
content
and
nips
a
bite
of
food
whenever
it
can
see
a
chance
anywhere
along
the
road
giving
us
no
more
trouble
than
a
dog
and
by
the
way
i
think
i
have
not
mentioned
our
faithful
camp
dog
a
worthy
member
of
our
party
who
stood
watch
always
and
gave
us
a
sure
alarm
if
anything
unusual
happened
anywhere
about
he
was
perhaps
only
one
of
a
hundred
that
tried
to
cross
the
plains
and
had
to
be
abandoned
when
they
reached
the
upper
platte
where
the
alkali
dust
made
their
feet
so
sore
they
could
not
travel
and
as
they
could
not
be
hauled
on
wagons
they
were
left
behind
but
this
dog
cuff
did
not
propose
to
be
left
behind
to
starve
and
crippled
along
after
us
we
doing
all
we
could
for
him
and
proved
as
tough
as
the
best
of
us
bennett
and
i
had
trained
him
as
a
hunting
dog
in
the
east
and
he
was
very
knowing
and
handy
in
every
particular
we
were
out
of
this
camp
at
daylight
very
little
rest
for
some
of
us
but
we
must
make
the
best
of
the
cool
morning
while
the
snow
is
hard
and
so
move
on
as
soon
as
we
can
see
the
way
as
it
gets
lighter
and
the
sun
comes
up
red
and
hot
out
of
the
desert
we
have
a
grand
view
of
the
great
spread
of
the
country
to
south
and
of
the
great
snow
mountain
to
the
north
and
east
the
peak
standing
over
the
place
where
we
left
our
wagons
nineteen
days
before
on
the
edge
of
death
valley
the
glare
of
the
snow
on
the
sun
makes
us
nearly
blind
but
we
hurry
on
to
try
to
cross
it
before
it
becomes
so
soft
as
to
slump
under
our
feet
it
is
two
or
three
feet
in
the
deepest
places
and
probably
has
been
three
times
as
deep
when
freshly
fallen
but
it
is
now
solid
and
icy
our
rawhide
moccasins
protect
our
feet
from
cold
and
both
we
and
the
animals
got
along
fairly
well
the
oxen
breaking
through
occasionally
as
the
snow
softened
up
but
generally
walking
on
the
top
as
we
did
ourselves
the
snow
field
reached
much
farther
down
the
western
slope
than
we
had
hoped
much
farther
than
on
the
eastern
side
before
we
got
out
of
it
we
saw
the
track
of
some
animal
which
had
crossed
our
route
but
as
it
had
been
made
some
days
before
and
now
could
be
seen
only
as
some
holes
in
the
surface
we
could
not
determine
what
sort
of
an
animal
it
was
a
mile
or
two
down
the
hill
we
were
at
last
out
of
the
snow
and
a
little
farther
on
we
came
to
the
little
babbling
brook
rogers
and
i
had
so
long
painted
in
the
most
refreshing
colors
to
the
tired
women
with
water
wood
and
grass
on
every
hand
the
three
greatest
blessings
of
a
camper
life
here
was
where
rogers
and
i
had
cooked
and
eaten
our
meat
of
crow
quail
and
hawk
pretty
hard
food
but
then
the
blessed
water
there
it
danced
and
jumped
over
the
rocks
singing
the
merriest
song
one
ever
heard
as
it
said
drink
drink
ye
thirsty
ones
your
fill
the
happiest
sweetest
music
to
the
poor
starved
thirsty
souls
wasted
down
almost
to
haggard
skeletons
o
if
some
poet
of
wildest
imagination
could
only
place
himself
in
the
position
of
those
poor
tired
travelers
to
whom
water
in
thick
muddy
pools
had
been
a
blessing
who
had
eagerly
drank
the
fluid
even
when
so
salt
and
bitter
us
to
be
repulsive
and
now
to
see
the
clear
pure
liquid
distilled
from
the
crystal
snow
abundant
free
filled
with
life
and
health
and
write
it
in
words
the
song
of
that
joyous
brook
and
set
it
to
the
music
that
it
made
as
it
echoed
in
gentle
waves
from
the
rocks
and
lofty
walls
and
with
the
gentle
accompaniment
of
rustling
trees
a
soft
singing
hush
telling
of
rest
and
peace
and
happiness
new
life
seemed
to
come
to
the
dear
women
o
what
a
beautiful
stream
say
they
and
they
dip
in
a
tin
cup
and
drink
then
watch
in
dreaming
admiration
the
water
as
it
goes
hurrying
down
then
dip
and
drink
again
and
again
watch
the
jolly
rollicking
brook
as
if
it
were
the
most
entertaining
thing
in
the
whole
wide
earth
why
ca
such
a
stream
as
that
run
out
of
the
great
snow
mountain
in
the
dry
death
valley
say
they
so
we
could
get
water
on
the
way
the
men
have
felt
as
glad
as
any
of
them
but
have
gathered
wood
and
made
a
fire
and
now
a
camp
kettle
of
cut
up
meat
is
boiling
for
our
supper
it
was
not
yet
night
but
we
must
camp
in
so
beautiful
a
place
as
this
and
though
the
food
was
poor
we
were
better
off
than
we
had
been
before
bennett
proposed
that
i
take
the
mule
and
go
back
to
where
we
saw
the
track
of
the
animal
in
the
snow
and
follow
it
in
hope
that
we
might
get
some
game
for
we
had
an
idea
it
might
be
an
elk
or
bear
or
some
large
game
good
to
kill
and
give
us
better
meat
so
i
saddled
the
mule
and
took
the
trail
back
till
i
came
to
the
track
then
followed
it
as
best
i
could
for
it
was
very
dull
and
gave
me
no
idea
what
it
was
i
traced
out
of
the
snow
and
then
in
a
blind
way
through
bushes
as
high
as
the
mule
back
chaparral
we
called
it
now
among
which
i
made
my
way
with
difficulty
i
could
now
see
that
the
track
was
made
by
an
ox
or
cow
perhaps
an
elk
i
could
not
tell
for
sure
it
was
so
faint
this
chaparral
covered
a
large
piece
of
table
land
and
i
made
my
way
through
it
following
the
track
for
a
mile
or
two
till
i
came
to
the
top
of
a
steep
hill
sloping
down
into
a
deep
cañon
and
a
creek
on
the
bank
of
which
grew
sycamore
and
alder
trees
with
large
willows
i
stopped
here
some
minutes
to
see
if
i
could
see
or
hear
the
movement
of
of
anything
across
the
creek
i
could
see
a
small
piece
of
perhaps
half
an
acre
of
natural
meadow
and
in
it
some
small
bunches
of
sycamore
trees
after
a
little
i
discovered
some
sort
of
a
horned
animal
there
and
i
reckoned
this
was
good
enough
game
for
me
to
try
and
capture
so
led
the
mule
out
to
one
side
and
down
the
hill
near
the
creek
then
tied
her
and
crept
along
the
bank
about
four
feet
high
toward
the
little
meadow
when
about
right
as
i
thought
i
climbed
up
behind
a
bunch
of
sycamores
and
when
i
slowly
and
cautiously
raised
up
i
was
within
fifty
yards
of
a
cow
or
steer
of
some
sort
which
i
could
dimly
see
i
put
a
ball
square
in
its
forehead
and
it
fell
without
a
struggle
i
loaded
again
quick
as
possible
and
there
saw
two
other
smaller
cattle
stepping
very
high
as
though
terrified
but
not
aware
of
the
nature
or
location
of
the
danger
i
gave
a
low
whistle
and
one
of
them
looked
toward
me
long
enough
for
me
to
put
a
ball
in
it
the
third
one
was
now
behind
a
clump
of
sycamores
and
i
soon
saw
its
face
through
a
little
opening
not
more
than
three
inches
wide
i
made
a
shot
and
wounded
it
and
then
rushed
up
and
gave
it
a
fatal
one
i
examined
my
game
and
found
the
first
one
was
a
poor
old
cow
but
the
others
were
yearlings
one
of
them
very
fat
and
nice
and
i
soon
had
the
hind
quarters
skinned
out
and
all
the
fat
i
could
find
which
made
a
big
load
for
the
mule
it
was
now
almost
dark
and
the
next
problem
was
to
get
back
to
camp
again
the
brushy
hills
would
be
terrible
to
cross
with
a
load
of
meat
and
by
the
way
the
ground
lay
i
concluded
our
camp
was
on
this
same
creek
farther
down
the
only
way
that
seemed
at
all
feasible
was
to
follow
the
course
of
the
stream
if
possible
rather
than
return
the
course
over
which
i
had
come
there
were
so
many
bushes
and
trees
along
the
bank
that
i
had
to
take
to
the
bed
and
follow
in
the
water
and
as
it
was
rocky
and
rough
and
so
dark
i
could
not
see
well
how
to
step
i
stumbled
into
holes
and
pools
up
to
my
waist
wet
as
a
rat
coming
to
a
small
open
place
i
decided
i
had
better
camp
for
the
night
and
not
attempt
further
progress
in
the
darkness
and
the
decision
was
hastened
by
dark
clouds
which
began
to
gather
and
a
few
sprinkles
of
rain
began
to
come
there
was
a
good
patch
of
grass
for
the
mule
but
all
was
uncomfortable
for
me
with
the
prospect
for
a
rainy
night
but
as
wood
was
plenty
i
decided
to
make
a
fire
and
take
the
chances
i
looked
for
matches
and
scratched
one
no
go
they
were
damp
and
scratch
as
careful
and
quickly
as
i
could
there
was
no
answering
spark
or
flame
and
darkness
reigned
supreme
a
camp
without
a
fire
in
this
wet
place
was
not
to
be
thought
of
so
i
concluded
i
might
as
well
be
slowly
working
my
way
down
along
the
stream
through
thick
brush
and
cold
water
as
to
sit
here
in
the
cold
and
wait
so
the
little
mule
and
i
started
on
wading
the
creek
in
thick
darkness
getting
only
the
most
dim
reflected
light
from
the
sky
through
now
and
then
an
opening
in
the
trees
i
did
not
know
then
how
easy
it
was
for
a
grizzly
to
capture
myself
the
mule
and
meat
and
have
quite
a
variety
for
supper
but
the
grizzly
stayed
at
home
and
we
followed
on
through
brambles
and
hard
brush
through
which
it
was
almost
impossible
to
force
one
way
as
it
turned
out
i
was
not
in
the
track
of
the
storm
and
did
not
suffer
much
from
it
soon
the
cañon
grew
wider
and
i
could
make
out
on
the
right
hand
a
piece
of
table
land
covered
with
brush
that
seemed
easier
to
get
through
than
the
creek
bed
the
hill
up
to
the
table
land
was
very
steep
but
not
more
than
fifty
yards
high
and
when
the
mule
tried
to
get
up
she
got
along
very
well
till
near
the
top
when
she
slipped
in
the
wet
earth
and
never
stopped
till
she
reached
the
bottom
and
lay
down
she
was
helped
up
to
her
feet
again
and
we
tried
it
in
another
place
i
holding
her
from
slipping
when
she
stopped
to
rest
and
at
last
we
reached
the
top
the
mule
started
on
seeming
to
follow
a
trail
but
i
could
not
see
whether
there
was
a
trail
or
not
so
thick
was
the
darkness
but
there
was
evidently
something
of
the
kind
for
the
brush
was
two
or
three
feet
high
and
very
thick
after
proceeding
some
distance
the
mule
stopped
and
did
not
seem
to
wish
to
go
any
farther
i
was
pretty
sure
there
was
something
in
front
of
her
that
blocked
the
way
and
so
worked
my
way
through
the
brush
and
carefully
past
her
i
could
partly
see
and
partly
hear
something
just
ahead
and
in
a
moment
found
it
was
our
good
faithful
cuff
and
no
frightful
spook
at
all
the
good
fellow
had
discovered
our
approach
and
came
out
to
meet
us
and
i
am
sure
the
mule
was
as
glad
as
i
was
to
see
him
he
crawled
through
the
brush
and
smelled
at
the
mule
load
and
then
went
forward
in
the
trail
which
we
followed
it
was
a
long
time
after
midnight
when
we
reached
camp
there
was
a
good
fire
burning
but
all
were
asleep
till
i
led
the
mule
up
to
the
fire
and
called
out
wake
up
when
they
were
most
of
them
on
their
feet
in
a
minute
without
stopping
to
dress
for
all
had
slept
a
long
time
without
taking
off
their
clothes
john
took
charge
of
the
mule
and
unloaded
it
telling
me
to
get
into
his
warm
bed
i
took
off
my
wet
clothes
and
told
him
to
dry
them
and
then
got
between
the
dry
warm
blankets
in
greatest
comfort
daylight
came
very
quickly
it
seemed
to
me
and
before
i
finally
rose
the
sun
had
been
up
some
hours
before
me
before
i
fell
asleep
i
could
hear
the
women
say
as
they
cut
off
the
pieces
of
meat
to
roast
see
the
fat
only
see
how
nice
it
is
quickly
roasted
on
the
coals
they
ate
the
delicate
morsels
with
a
relish
and
most
of
all
praised
the
sweet
fat
we
like
to
have
it
all
fat
said
they
showing
how
their
system
craved
the
nourishment
the
poor
starved
beef
could
not
give
no
one
went
to
bed
after
i
came
but
all
sat
and
roasted
meat
and
ate
till
they
were
satisfied
this
sporting
trip
was
quite
different
from
deer
hunting
in
wisconsin
and
nothing
like
looking
for
game
in
death
valley
where
nothing
lived
it
was
the
hardest
night
work
that
ever
came
to
me
in
many
a
day
and
not
the
wild
sport
i
generally
looked
for
when
on
the
chase
i
felt
pretty
well
when
i
got
up
and
a
chunk
of
my
last
night
prize
which
had
been
toasted
for
me
was
eaten
with
a
relish
for
it
was
the
best
of
meat
and
i
of
course
had
a
first
class
appetite
i
had
to
tell
them
my
last
hunting
story
and
was
much
praised
as
a
lucky
boy
we
would
not
be
compelled
to
kill
any
more
of
our
poor
oxen
in
order
to
live
so
far
we
had
killed
six
of
them
and
there
were
five
left
our
present
situation
was
much
appreciated
compared
with
that
of
a
few
days
ago
when
we
were
crawling
slowly
over
the
desert
hungry
and
dry
when
to
lie
was
far
easier
than
to
take
steps
forward
we
felt
like
rejoicing
at
our
deliverance
and
there
was
no
mourning
now
for
us
the
surrounding
hills
and
higher
mountains
seemed
more
beautiful
to
us
they
were
covered
with
green
trees
and
brush
not
a
desert
place
in
sight
the
clear
little
singing
brook
ran
merrily
on
its
way
the
happiest
brightest
stream
in
all
my
memory
wild
birds
came
near
us
without
fear
and
seemed
very
friendly
all
was
calm
and
the
bright
sunshine
exactly
warm
enough
so
that
no
one
could
complain
of
heat
or
cold
when
ready
to
move
it
was
announced
that
i
had
lost
my
saddle
blanket
in
my
adventure
so
they
substituted
another
one
and
i
took
the
back
track
to
the
place
where
the
mule
slipped
down
the
bank
and
there
i
found
it
i
soon
overtook
them
again
just
as
they
were
going
to
camp
on
bennett
account
as
she
had
been
suddenly
taken
sick
with
severe
pain
and
vomiting
something
as
rogers
and
i
had
been
after
eating
our
first
california
corn
meal
the
rich
fat
meat
was
too
strong
for
her
weak
stomach
arcane
all
along
had
an
idea
that
rogers
and
i
meant
to
surprise
them
by
leading
them
to
believe
the
house
we
had
visited
was
quite
a
distance
off
and
then
to
so
manage
it
that
it
should
appear
upon
their
sight
suddenly
we
assured
them
it
would
take
two
or
more
camps
before
we
could
get
there
and
if
bennett
did
not
soon
recover
even
more
than
that
our
camp
here
was
under
a
great
live
oak
the
ground
deep
covered
with
dry
leaves
and
near
by
a
beautiful
meadow
where
our
cattle
and
mule
ate
drank
and
rested
the
oxen
chewing
their
cud
with
such
an
air
of
comfort
as
had
not
come
to
them
since
leaving
their
eastern
pastures
they
seemed
as
much
pleased
as
any
one
they
would
lie
down
and
rest
and
eat
at
the
same
time
in
perfectly
enjoyable
laziness
here
we
all
rested
and
washed
such
clothes
as
we
could
do
without
long
enough
to
dry
and
washed
our
faces
and
hands
over
and
over
again
to
remove
the
dirt
which
had
been
burned
and
sweated
in
so
completely
as
not
to
come
off
readily
we
sat
on
the
bank
of
the
brook
with
our
feet
dangling
in
the
water
a
most
refreshing
bath
and
they
too
began
to
look
clean
again
we
often
saw
tracks
of
the
grizzly
bear
about
but
in
our
ignorance
had
no
fear
of
them
for
we
did
not
know
they
were
a
dangerous
animal
an
owl
came
and
hooted
in
the
night
but
that
was
the
only
challenge
any
wild
beast
or
bird
gave
to
our
peaceful
and
restful
camp
we
were
out
of
the
dreadful
sands
and
shadows
of
death
valley
its
exhausting
phantoms
its
salty
columns
bitter
lakes
and
wild
dreary
sunken
desolation
if
the
waves
of
the
sea
could
flow
in
and
cover
its
barren
nakedness
as
we
now
know
they
might
if
a
few
sandy
barriers
were
swept
away
it
would
be
indeed
a
blessing
for
in
it
there
is
naught
of
good
comfort
or
satisfaction
but
ever
in
the
minds
of
those
who
braved
its
heat
and
sands
a
thought
of
a
horrid
charnel
house
a
corner
of
the
earth
so
dreary
that
it
requires
an
exercise
of
strongest
faith
to
believe
that
the
great
creator
ever
smiled
upon
it
as
a
portion
of
his
work
and
pronounced
it
very
good
we
had
crossed
the
great
north
american
continent
from
a
land
of
plenty
over
great
barren
hills
and
plains
to
another
mild
and
beautiful
region
where
though
still
in
winter
months
we
were
basking
in
the
warmth
and
luxuriance
of
early
summer
we
thought
not
of
the
gold
we
had
come
to
win
we
were
dead
almost
and
now
we
lived
we
were
parched
with
thirst
and
now
the
brightest
of
crystal
streams
invited
us
to
stoop
and
drink
we
were
starved
so
that
we
had
looked
at
each
other
with
maniac
thoughts
and
now
we
placed
in
our
mouth
the
very
fat
of
the
land
we
had
seen
our
cattle
almost
perishing
seen
them
grow
gaunt
and
tottering
seen
them
slowly
plod
along
with
hanging
heads
and
only
the
supremacy
of
human
will
over
animal
instinct
had
kept
them
from
lying
down
never
to
rise
again
now
they
were
in
pastures
of
sweet
grass
chewing
the
cud
of
content
and
satisfaction
life
which
had
been
a
burden
grew
sweet
to
us
and
though
it
may
be
that
our
words
of
praise
to
him
whose
will
was
to
deliver
us
out
of
the
jaws
of
death
were
not
set
nor
formal
yet
his
eye
saw
the
truth
in
our
hearts
and
saw
there
the
fullest
expression
of
our
gratitude
and
thankfulness
who
shall
say
the
thanks
that
arose
were
less
acceptable
because
not
given
on
bended
knees
before
gilded
altars
though
across
the
desert
and
evidently
in
the
long
promised
land
our
troubles
and
trials
were
not
through
by
any
means
but
evidently
we
were
out
of
danger
our
lives
seemed
to
be
secure
and
we
were
soon
to
meet
with
settlers
who
would
no
doubt
extend
to
us
the
hand
of
human
sympathy
many
long
miles
yet
remained
between
us
and
the
rivers
in
whose
sands
were
hidden
the
tiny
grains
of
gold
we
came
to
seek
the
rest
in
the
lovely
camp
had
answered
to
cause
bennett
to
feel
quite
well
again
by
the
next
morning
and
we
made
ready
to
proceed
we
had
the
trail
of
the
jayhawkers
to
follow
so
the
vines
brambles
and
tangles
which
had
perplexed
rogers
and
myself
in
our
first
passage
were
now
somewhat
broken
down
and
we
could
get
along
very
well
without
further
clearing
of
the
road
until
the
hills
came
down
so
close
on
both
sides
that
there
was
no
room
except
in
the
very
bed
of
the
stream
there
was
no
other
way
so
we
waded
among
after
the
oxen
as
best
we
could
sometimes
the
women
fell
down
for
a
rawhide
moccasin
soaked
soft
in
water
was
not
a
very
comfortable
or
convenient
shoe
however
it
might
be
adapted
to
hot
dry
sands
the
creek
was
shaded
and
the
water
quite
cool
the
trail
such
as
it
was
crossed
the
creek
often
and
generally
was
nothing
else
than
the
stream
itself
the
constant
wading
and
wet
cold
clothing
caused
the
women
to
give
out
soon
and
we
selected
the
first
dry
suitable
place
which
offered
food
for
the
oxen
as
a
place
to
camp
wood
was
plenty
and
dry
so
a
good
fire
was
soon
burning
and
the
poor
women
wet
to
the
waist
and
even
higher
were
standing
before
it
turning
round
and
round
to
get
warm
and
dry
someone
remarked
that
they
resembled
geese
hanging
before
the
fire
to
roast
as
they
slowly
revolved
and
it
was
all
owing
to
their
fatigue
that
the
suggester
did
not
receive
merited
punishment
then
and
there
at
their
hands
as
they
got
a
little
dry
and
comfortable
they
remarked
that
even
an
excess
of
water
like
this
was
better
than
the
desert
where
there
was
none
at
all
and
as
to
their
looks
there
were
no
society
people
about
to
point
their
fingers
at
them
and
when
they
reached
a
settled
country
they
hoped
to
have
a
chance
to
change
their
clothes
and
get
two
dresses
apiece
and
that
these
would
be
long
enough
to
hide
their
knees
which
these
poor
tatters
quite
failed
to
do
one
remarked
that
she
was
sure
she
had
been
down
in
the
brook
a
dozen
times
and
that
she
did
not
consider
cold
water
baths
so
frequently
repeated
were
good
for
the
health
young
charley
arcane
had
been
getting
better
for
some
days
no
medicine
had
been
given
him
and
it
was
no
doubt
the
change
of
air
and
water
that
had
begun
to
effect
a
cure
arcane
had
a
hard
time
of
it
to
keep
the
brush
from
pulling
george
and
melissa
off
of
old
crump
into
the
water
it
was
indeed
one
of
the
hardest
day
work
of
the
whole
journey
but
no
one
was
low
spirited
and
all
felt
very
well
the
camping
place
was
in
a
deep
cañon
surrounded
by
thick
brush
so
that
no
wind
came
in
to
chill
us
everybody
was
cook
and
nobody
was
boss
not
a
cent
of
money
among
us
nor
any
chance
to
use
any
if
we
had
possessed
it
we
had
nice
sweet
fat
meat
cooked
rare
or
well
done
as
each
one
preferred
and
no
complaints
about
the
waiters
the
conditions
were
so
favorable
compared
with
the
terrible
death
valley
and
its
surroundings
that
every
one
remarked
about
it
and
no
one
felt
in
the
least
like
finding
fault
with
the
little
inconveniences
we
were
forced
to
put
up
with
it
might
cure
an
inveterate
to
take
a
course
of
training
in
the
desert
the
next
day
we
did
not
wade
half
as
much
and
after
a
few
hours
of
travel
we
suddenly
emerged
from
the
brush
into
a
creek
bottom
which
was
much
wider
with
not
a
tree
to
obstruct
our
way
the
soil
was
sandy
and
covered
more
or
less
with
sage
brush
and
the
stream
which
had
been
strong
and
deep
enough
to
make
us
very
wet
now
sank
entirely
out
of
sight
in
the
sandy
bottom
the
hills
were
thinly
timbered
on
the
left
side
but
quite
brushy
on
the
right
and
we
could
see
the
track
of
cattle
in
the
sand
no
signs
of
other
animals
but
some
small
birds
came
near
and
meadow
larks
whistled
their
tune
quite
familiar
to
us
but
still
sounding
slightly
different
from
the
song
of
the
same
bird
in
the
east
high
in
the
air
could
be
seen
a
large
sailing
hawk
or
buzzard
we
stopped
to
rest
at
noon
and
noticed
that
the
water
ran
a
little
in
the
creek
bed
but
by
the
time
we
were
ready
to
start
we
found
none
with
which
to
fill
our
canteens
no
doubt
this
water
was
poured
into
the
cañon
somewhere
near
the
place
where
we
killed
the
three
cattle
and
we
had
got
out
of
it
before
the
flood
came
down
it
was
astonishing
to
see
how
the
thirsty
sand
drank
up
the
quite
abundant
flow
the
next
day
we
came
down
to
the
point
of
hill
that
nearly
crossed
the
valley
and
we
crossed
the
low
ridge
rather
than
make
a
longer
trip
to
get
around
by
way
of
the
valley
as
we
reached
the
summit
there
appeared
before
us
as
beautiful
a
rural
picture
as
one
ever
looked
upon
a
large
green
meadow
of
a
thousand
acres
more
or
less
its
southwest
side
bounded
by
low
mountains
at
the
base
of
which
oak
trees
were
plenty
but
no
brush
or
undergrowth
it
was
like
a
grand
old
park
such
as
we
read
of
in
english
tales
all
over
the
meadow
cattle
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
grazed
the
and
speckled
of
old
jacob
breed
being
very
prominent
some
lazily
cropped
the
grass
some
still
more
lazily
reclined
and
chewed
their
cud
while
frisky
calves
exercised
their
muscles
in
swift
races
and
then
secured
their
dinner
from
anxious
mothers
we
camped
at
once
and
took
the
loads
from
all
the
animals
that
they
might
feed
in
comfort
on
the
sweet
grass
that
lay
before
them
we
tarried
here
perhaps
two
hours
till
the
cattle
stopped
eating
and
amply
enjoyed
the
scene
never
again
would
any
one
of
the
party
go
back
over
that
dreary
desert
they
said
and
everyone
wondered
why
all
places
could
not
be
as
green
and
beautiful
as
this
one
i
can
not
half
tell
how
we
felt
and
acted
nor
what
we
said
in
our
delight
over
this
picture
of
plenty
the
strong
contrasts
created
strong
impressions
and
the
tongues
so
long
silent
in
our
dry
and
dreary
trouble
were
loosened
to
say
everything
the
heart
inspired
think
as
much
as
you
can
you
can
not
think
it
all
we
felt
much
better
after
our
rest
and
the
oxen
seemed
stronger
and
better
able
as
well
as
more
willing
to
carry
their
loads
so
we
soon
prepared
to
move
on
down
the
valley
toward
the
house
we
had
spoken
of
as
the
goal
we
were
to
reach
it
was
now
the
day
of
march
and
this
date
as
well
as
the
day
of
november
will
always
remain
an
important
one
in
memory
on
the
last
named
day
we
left
the
trail
to
take
the
unfortunate
and
for
four
long
months
we
had
wandered
and
struggled
in
terrible
hardship
every
point
of
that
terrible
journey
is
indelibly
fixed
upon
my
memory
and
though
years
of
age
on
april
i
can
locate
every
camp
and
if
strong
enough
could
follow
that
weary
trail
from
death
valley
to
los
angeles
with
unerring
accuracy
the
brushy
cañon
we
have
just
described
is
now
occupied
by
the
southern
pacific
railroad
and
the
steep
and
narrow
ridge
pierced
by
a
tunnel
through
which
the
trains
pass
the
beautiful
meadow
we
so
much
admired
has
now
upon
its
border
a
railroad
station
newhall
and
at
the
proper
season
some
portion
of
it
is
covered
with
thousands
of
trays
of
golden
apricots
grown
in
the
luxuriant
orchards
just
beyond
the
hills
toward
the
coast
and
here
drying
in
the
bright
summer
sun
the
cattle
in
the
coats
are
gone
but
one
who
knows
the
ground
can
see
our
picture
loaded
up
again
we
start
down
the
beautiful
grassy
valley
the
women
each
with
a
staff
in
hand
and
everything
is
new
and
strange
to
us
rogers
and
i
know
that
we
will
soon
meet
people
who
are
strangers
to
us
who
speak
a
strange
language
of
which
we
know
nothing
and
how
we
without
a
dollar
are
to
proceed
to
get
our
food
and
things
we
need
are
questions
we
can
not
answer
nor
devise
any
easy
way
to
overcome
the
mines
are
yet
five
hundred
miles
away
and
we
know
not
of
any
work
for
us
to
do
nearer
our
lives
have
been
given
back
to
us
and
now
comes
the
problem
of
how
to
sustain
them
manfully
and
independently
as
soon
as
possible
if
worse
comes
to
worst
we
can
walk
to
san
francisco
probably
kill
enough
game
on
the
way
and
possibly
reach
the
gold
mines
at
last
but
the
way
was
not
clear
we
must
trust
much
to
luck
and
fortune
and
the
ever
faithful
providence
which
rarely
fails
those
who
truly
try
to
help
themselves
we
began
to
think
some
very
independent
thoughts
we
had
a
mule
to
carry
our
camp
kettle
and
meat
our
cattle
were
now
beginning
to
improve
and
would
soon
get
fat
these
could
carry
our
blankets
and
odd
loads
while
old
crump
the
christian
could
still
carry
the
children
bennett
and
i
knew
how
to
hunt
and
had
good
rifles
so
we
could
still
proceed
and
we
determined
that
come
what
may
will
be
these
were
some
of
the
plans
we
talked
over
at
our
camps
and
resting
places
and
as
we
walked
along
if
we
could
get
the
two
families
fixed
in
some
way
so
they
could
do
without
rogers
and
i
we
could
strike
for
the
mines
quite
rapidly
and
no
doubt
soon
get
ourselves
on
good
footing
we
were
younger
than
the
rest
and
could
endure
more
hardship
we
decide
to
remain
together
till
we
get
to
los
angeles
and
then
see
what
is
best
we
reached
our
camping
place
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
house
we
have
so
long
striven
to
reach
here
we
unloaded
in
the
shade
of
a
large
willow
tree
and
scarcely
had
we
removed
the
harness
from
the
oxen
when
the
good
lady
of
the
house
and
her
little
child
came
down
to
see
us
she
stood
for
a
moment
and
looked
around
her
and
at
the
two
small
children
on
the
blankets
and
we
could
hear
her
murmur
very
poor
she
could
see
our
ragged
clothes
and
dirty
faces
and
everything
told
her
of
our
extreme
destitution
after
seeing
our
oxen
and
mule
which
were
so
poor
she
said
to
herself
so
thin
she
then
turned
to
us
rogers
and
i
whom
she
had
seen
before
and
as
her
lively
little
youngster
clung
to
her
dress
as
if
in
fear
of
such
queer
looking
people
as
we
were
she
took
an
orange
from
her
pocket
and
pointing
to
the
children
of
our
party
wanted
to
know
if
we
had
given
them
the
four
oranges
she
sent
to
them
by
us
we
made
signs
that
we
had
done
as
she
requested
when
she
smiled
and
said
good
boys
in
all
this
talk
neither
could
say
a
word
the
other
could
understand
and
the
conversation
was
carried
on
by
signs
arcane
said
to
her
me
catholic
which
she
seemed
partly
to
comprehend
and
seemed
more
friendly
about
this
time
two
men
rode
up
and
took
a
look
at
us
arcane
who
was
a
mason
gave
the
masonic
sign
as
he
told
me
afterward
but
neither
of
them
recognized
it
we
used
such
words
of
spanish
as
i
had
taken
down
in
my
pass
book
and
committed
to
memory
and
by
motions
in
addition
to
these
made
them
understand
something
of
the
state
of
affairs
and
that
french
who
had
assisted
us
before
had
told
us
we
could
get
some
meat
from
them
these
men
were
finely
mounted
wore
long
leggins
made
of
hide
dressed
with
the
hair
on
which
reached
to
their
hips
stiff
hats
with
a
broad
rim
and
great
spurs
at
their
heels
each
had
a
coil
of
braided
rawhide
rope
on
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
and
all
these
arrangements
together
made
a
very
dashing
outfit
they
seemed
to
understand
what
we
had
said
to
them
for
they
rode
off
with
a
rush
and
came
back
in
a
short
time
leading
a
fine
fat
heifer
when
near
our
camp
the
rider
who
was
behind
threw
his
and
caught
both
hind
feet
of
the
animal
when
by
a
sudden
movement
of
the
horses
the
heifer
was
thrown
one
of
them
dismounted
and
at
the
command
the
horse
backed
up
and
kept
the
rope
tight
while
the
man
went
up
to
the
prostrate
beast
and
cut
its
throat
as
soon
as
it
had
ceased
struggling
they
loosened
their
ropes
and
coiled
them
up
they
came
to
us
and
pointed
to
the
dead
heifer
in
a
way
which
said
help
yourselves
we
were
much
gratified
at
the
generosity
of
the
people
and
at
once
dressed
the
animal
as
it
lay
cutting
off
some
good
fat
pieces
which
we
roasted
over
the
fire
and
ate
with
a
relish
it
seemed
as
if
meat
never
tasted
so
good
as
that
did
sweet
fragrant
and
juicy
if
some
french
cook
could
only
cook
a
steak
that
would
smell
and
taste
to
his
customers
as
that
meal
tasted
to
us
his
art
would
be
perfect
we
separated
a
hind
quarter
and
hung
it
to
a
tree
and
when
the
lady
came
back
we
told
her
that
the
piece
we
had
selected
was
enough
for
our
present
use
so
she
caused
the
remainder
with
the
hide
to
be
taken
to
the
house
toward
night
they
drove
up
a
lot
of
cows
and
calves
and
other
cattle
into
their
cattle
yard
or
corral
as
it
is
called
all
over
california
a
stockade
of
strong
oak
posts
set
deep
in
the
ground
and
close
together
enclosing
a
space
of
about
half
an
acre
the
horsemen
now
rode
in
and
began
to
catch
the
calves
with
their
ropes
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
able
to
throw
a
rope
over
a
calf
head
or
around
either
leg
they
desired
with
better
aim
and
at
as
great
a
distance
as
one
could
shoot
a
revolver
and
we
saw
at
once
that
a
good
rope
in
the
hands
of
an
experienced
man
and
horse
was
a
weapon
in
many
respects
superior
to
firearms
of
any
kind
a
man
near
the
gate
loosened
the
ropes
and
pushed
the
calves
into
a
separate
corral
till
they
had
as
many
as
they
desired
rogers
watched
the
circus
till
it
was
over
and
then
returned
to
camp
meeting
on
the
way
bennett
and
arcane
with
their
wives
and
children
carrying
some
blankets
for
the
good
lady
had
invited
them
to
come
up
to
the
house
and
sleep
they
said
we
could
go
down
and
keep
camp
if
old
dog
cuff
was
willing
for
they
had
left
him
guarding
the
property
he
was
pleased
enough
to
have
us
come
and
keep
him
company
and
we
slept
nicely
disturbed
only
a
little
by
the
barking
of
the
house
dogs
and
the
hooting
of
an
owl
that
came
to
visit
our
tree
the
people
came
back
to
camp
in
the
morning
and
had
their
experience
to
relate
their
hosts
first
baked
some
kind
of
flapjacks
and
divided
them
among
their
guests
then
gave
them
beans
seasoned
hot
with
pepper
also
great
pieces
of
squash
cooked
before
the
fire
which
they
said
was
delicious
and
sweet
more
than
good
then
came
a
dish
of
dried
meat
pounded
fine
mixed
with
green
peppers
and
well
fried
in
beef
tallow
this
seemed
to
be
the
favorite
dish
of
the
proprietors
but
was
a
little
too
hot
for
our
people
they
called
it
cum
meat
with
pepper
and
we
soon
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
best
dishes
cooked
by
the
californians
the
children
were
carefully
waited
on
and
given
special
attention
to
by
these
good
people
and
it
was
nearly
ten
before
the
feast
was
over
then
the
household
had
evening
worship
by
meeting
in
silence
except
a
few
set
words
repeated
by
some
in
turn
the
ceremony
lasting
half
an
hour
or
more
then
they
came
and
wished
them
in
the
most
polite
manner
and
left
them
to
arrange
their
blankets
on
the
floor
and
go
to
sleep
the
unaccustomed
shelter
of
a
roof
and
the
restless
worrying
of
the
children
who
required
much
attention
for
the
change
of
diet
had
about
the
same
effect
on
them
as
on
rogers
and
myself
when
we
first
partook
of
the
california
food
gave
them
little
sleep
but
still
they
rested
and
were
truly
grateful
for
the
most
perfect
hospitality
of
these
kind
hearted
people
in
the
morning
the
two
horsemen
and
two
indians
went
to
the
corral
when
the
riders
would
catch
a
cow
with
their
ropes
and
draw
her
head
up
to
a
post
binding
it
fast
while
an
indian
took
a
short
piece
of
rope
and
closely
tied
the
hind
legs
together
above
the
gambrel
joint
making
the
tail
fast
also
they
had
a
large
bucket
and
several
gourds
the
indians
then
milked
the
cows
they
had
made
fast
getting
from
a
pint
to
two
quarts
from
each
one
milking
into
a
gourd
and
pouring
into
the
bucket
till
they
had
all
they
desired
the
calves
were
separated
the
night
before
so
they
could
secure
some
milk
cows
were
not
trained
to
stand
and
be
milked
as
they
were
at
home
setting
down
the
bucket
of
milk
before
us
with
some
small
gourds
for
dippers
we
were
invited
to
drink
all
we
wished
this
was
a
regular
banquet
to
us
for
our
famished
condition
and
good
appetites
made
food
relish
wonderfully
when
we
made
a
sign
of
wishing
to
pay
them
for
their
great
kindness
they
shook
their
heads
and
utterly
refused
it
was
genuine
sympathy
and
hospitality
on
their
part
and
none
of
us
ever
forgot
it
the
sight
of
a
native
californian
has
always
brought
out
thoughts
of
these
good
people
and
respect
and
thankfulness
to
the
race
this
rancho
at
which
we
were
so
kindly
entertained
was
called
san
francisquito
or
little
san
francisco
rancho
this
morning
arcane
with
our
assistance
made
an
arrangement
with
these
people
to
give
them
his
two
oxen
and
they
were
to
take
him
and
his
wife
and
child
to
the
at
a
place
called
san
pedro
from
which
place
he
hoped
in
some
way
to
get
passage
to
san
francisco
in
a
sailing
vessel
he
had
no
money
and
no
property
to
sell
except
perhaps
his
worth
about
ten
dollars
with
this
poor
prospect
before
him
he
started
for
the
sea
he
bade
bennett
folks
then
came
to
me
and
put
a
light
gold
ring
on
my
finger
saying
that
it
and
his
interest
in
the
little
mule
were
mine
then
he
gave
his
silver
watch
to
rogers
and
said
it
was
all
he
had
to
give
him
but
if
he
had
a
million
dollars
he
would
divide
and
still
think
it
a
small
compensation
for
the
faithful
services
we
had
rendered
him
i
can
never
repay
you
said
he
for
i
owe
you
a
debt
that
is
beyond
compensation
you
have
saved
our
lives
and
have
done
it
when
you
knew
you
could
get
nothing
for
it
i
hope
we
will
meet
again
and
when
we
do
you
will
be
welcome
if
you
hear
of
me
anywhere
come
and
see
me
for
i
want
to
tell
my
friends
who
manly
and
rogers
are
and
how
you
helped
us
good
bye
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
voice
full
of
emotion
and
the
firm
clasp
of
his
hand
told
how
earnest
he
was
and
that
he
felt
more
than
he
could
speak
he
helped
arcane
on
her
horse
then
gave
charlie
to
her
and
amid
waving
hands
and
many
from
our
friends
with
repeated
good
byes
from
the
old
ones
they
rode
away
arcane
could
hardly
speak
when
she
bade
us
farewell
she
was
so
much
affected
they
had
about
sixty
miles
to
ride
to
reach
the
sea
and
as
she
rode
on
a
saddle
and
was
unused
to
riding
i
knew
she
would
be
sadly
wearied
before
she
reached
the
coast
our
little
train
now
seemed
much
smaller
three
oxen
and
a
mule
were
all
our
animals
and
the
adults
must
still
walk
as
they
had
done
on
our
desert
route
but
we
were
comparatively
happy
for
we
had
plenty
of
good
meat
to
eat
plenty
of
sweet
water
to
drink
and
our
animals
were
contented
and
improving
every
day
grass
and
water
seemed
plenty
everywhere
we
put
our
luggage
on
the
oxen
and
the
mule
loaded
the
children
on
old
crump
as
we
had
done
before
and
were
ready
to
move
again
our
good
friends
stood
around
and
smiled
at
our
queer
arrangements
and
we
not
knowing
how
to
say
what
our
hearts
would
prompt
us
to
shook
their
hands
and
said
good
bye
in
answer
to
their
as
we
moved
away
waving
hands
to
each
other
the
men
then
detained
me
a
little
while
to
ask
me
more
about
the
road
we
had
come
over
how
far
it
was
and
how
bad
the
indians
were
and
other
particulars
i
told
him
by
signs
that
we
had
been
days
on
the
road
and
that
the
as
they
called
them
had
not
troubled
us
but
that
there
was
very
little
grass
or
water
in
all
that
land
he
made
a
sort
of
map
on
the
ground
and
made
me
understand
he
would
like
to
go
back
and
try
to
bring
out
the
wagons
we
had
left
behind
and
he
wanted
me
to
go
back
with
him
and
help
him
i
explained
to
him
by
the
map
he
had
made
and
one
which
i
made
myself
that
i
considered
it
impossible
to
bring
them
over
he
seemed
much
disappointed
and
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
said
very
bad
and
seemed
to
abandon
the
idea
of
getting
a
yankee
wagon
they
very
much
admired
an
american
wagon
for
their
own
vehicles
were
rude
affairs
as
i
shall
describe
we
bade
each
other
many
and
i
went
on
my
way
soon
catching
up
with
the
little
party
we
had
been
informed
that
it
was
ten
leagues
or
thirty
miles
to
los
angeles
whither
we
were
now
headed
we
had
now
been
a
whole
year
on
the
road
between
wisconsin
and
california
much
of
the
time
with
the
ground
for
a
bed
and
though
our
meals
had
been
sometimes
scanty
and
long
between
very
few
of
us
had
missed
one
on
account
of
sickness
some
less
strong
than
we
had
lain
down
to
perish
and
had
been
left
behind
without
coffin
or
grave
but
we
were
here
and
so
far
had
found
food
to
nourish
us
in
some
degree
with
prospects
now
of
game
in
the
future
if
nothing
better
offered
we
still
talked
of
going
to
the
gold
mines
on
foot
for
with
good
food
and
rest
our
courage
had
returned
and
we
wanted
to
succeed
our
camp
this
night
was
in
a
nice
watering
place
where
dry
oak
wood
was
plenty
and
grass
abundant
it
was
at
the
foot
of
the
san
fernando
mountain
not
rocky
as
we
had
found
our
road
some
time
before
but
smooth
and
covered
with
grass
it
was
rather
steep
to
climb
but
an
infant
compared
with
the
great
mountains
so
rough
and
barren
we
had
climbed
on
our
way
from
death
valley
our
present
condition
and
state
of
mind
was
an
anomalous
one
we
were
happy
encouraged
grateful
and
quite
contented
in
the
plenty
which
surrounded
us
and
still
there
was
a
sort
of
puzzling
uncertainty
as
to
our
future
the
way
to
which
seemed
very
obscure
in
the
past
we
had
pushed
on
our
very
best
and
a
kind
providence
had
kept
us
this
we
did
now
but
still
revolved
the
best
plans
and
the
most
fortunate
possibilities
in
our
minds
we
talked
of
the
time
when
we
should
be
able
to
show
hospitality
to
our
friends
and
to
strangers
who
might
need
our
open
hand
as
we
had
needed
the
favors
which
strangers
had
shown
us
in
the
last
few
days
we
ate
our
supper
of
good
meat
with
a
dessert
of
good
beans
our
kind
friends
had
given
us
and
enjoyed
it
greatly
as
we
sat
in
silence
a
flock
of
the
prettiest
most
graceful
birds
came
marching
along
and
halted
as
if
to
get
a
better
view
of
our
party
we
admired
them
so
much
that
we
made
not
a
move
but
waited
and
they
fearlessly
walked
on
again
we
could
see
that
there
were
two
which
were
larger
than
the
rest
and
from
twelve
to
twenty
smaller
ones
the
little
on
the
head
and
their
symmetrical
forms
made
them
specially
attractive
and
bennett
and
the
children
were
much
pleased
the
beauty
of
the
california
quail
is
especially
striking
to
one
who
sees
them
for
the
first
time
in
the
morning
we
began
to
climb
the
hill
getting
along
very
well
indeed
for
our
moccasins
were
now
dry
and
hard
and
fitted
the
foot
perfectly
we
did
not
try
to
make
great
speed
but
kept
steadily
on
and
as
we
were
used
to
climbing
we
reached
the
summit
easily
from
this
elevation
we
could
get
a
fine
view
of
the
big
grassy
plain
that
seemed
to
extend
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
not
far
from
us
the
buildings
and
gardens
of
the
san
fernando
mission
if
we
could
shut
out
the
mountains
the
landscape
would
remind
us
of
a
great
western
prairie
we
never
could
get
over
comparing
this
country
with
the
desolate
death
valley
for
it
seemed
as
if
such
strange
and
striking
opposites
could
hardly
exist
we
rested
here
a
little
while
and
then
wound
our
way
down
the
hill
to
the
level
land
a
few
miles
brought
us
to
the
mission
houses
and
the
church
of
san
fernando
there
was
not
much
life
about
them
in
fact
they
seemed
comparatively
deserted
for
we
saw
only
one
man
and
a
few
indians
the
man
brought
some
oranges
and
gave
the
children
one
each
after
a
little
rest
we
moved
on
over
our
road
which
was
now
quite
smooth
and
gently
descending
night
overtook
us
in
a
place
where
there
was
no
water
but
we
camped
and
suffered
no
inconvenience
a
stream
was
passed
next
day
and
a
house
near
by
unoccupied
the
road
now
began
to
enter
gently
rolling
hills
covered
with
big
grass
and
clover
which
indicated
rich
soil
and
we
never
get
tired
of
talking
about
it
at
the
top
of
these
hills
we
had
another
beautiful
view
as
far
south
and
west
as
the
eye
could
reach
small
objects
probably
horses
and
cattle
were
scattered
about
the
plain
grazing
in
the
midst
of
plenty
our
own
animals
were
given
frequent
opportunities
to
eat
and
again
and
again
we
rejoiced
over
the
beauty
of
course
it
was
not
such
a
surprise
and
wonder
as
it
was
when
such
a
view
first
burst
upon
our
sight
but
it
pleased
and
delighted
us
ever
on
the
east
was
a
peak
and
here
we
were
in
the
midst
of
green
fields
of
grass
and
wild
flowers
in
the
softest
climate
of
an
early
spring
these
strong
contrasts
beat
anything
we
had
ever
seen
perhaps
the
contrast
between
the
great
snow
mountain
and
the
hot
death
valley
was
greater
in
point
of
temperature
but
there
the
heat
brought
only
barrenness
and
of
the
two
the
snow
seemed
the
more
cheerful
here
the
vegetation
of
all
sorts
was
in
full
balance
with
the
balmy
air
and
in
comparison
the
snow
seemed
a
strange
neighbor
it
was
quite
a
contrast
to
our
cold
windy
march
in
wisconsin
and
we
wonder
if
it
is
always
summer
here
we
were
satisfied
that
even
if
we
could
get
no
further
we
could
live
in
such
a
land
as
this
the
broad
prairie
doubtless
belonged
to
the
united
states
and
we
could
have
our
share
and
own
a
little
piece
of
it
on
very
easy
terms
and
raise
our
own
cattle
and
corn
if
the
people
were
all
as
kind
as
those
we
had
met
we
were
sure
at
least
of
neighborly
treatment
i
have
endeavored
to
write
this
just
as
it
seemed
to
us
then
and
not
clothe
the
impressions
with
the
cover
of
later
experience
the
impressions
we
then
daily
received
and
the
sights
we
saw
were
stranger
than
the
wildest
fiction
and
if
it
so
strikes
you
my
friendly
reader
do
not
wonder
as
we
came
over
the
hills
we
could
see
a
village
near
the
southern
base
and
it
seemed
quite
near
us
it
was
a
new
and
strange
sight
to
us
as
we
approached
the
houses
were
only
one
story
high
and
seemed
built
of
mud
of
a
gray
color
the
roofs
flat
and
the
streets
almost
deserted
occasionally
a
man
could
be
seen
sometimes
a
dog
and
now
and
then
an
indian
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
house
the
whole
view
indicated
a
thinly
populated
place
and
the
entire
absence
of
wagons
or
animals
was
a
rather
strange
circumstance
to
us
it
occurred
to
us
at
first
that
if
all
the
emigrants
were
gone
our
reception
might
be
a
cool
one
in
this
city
of
mud
one
thing
was
in
its
favor
and
that
was
its
buildings
were
about
fire
proof
for
they
had
earthen
floors
and
flat
roofs
we
rested
half
an
hour
or
so
just
outside
and
then
ventured
down
the
hill
into
the
street
we
met
an
american
almost
the
first
man
and
when
we
asked
about
a
suitable
camping
place
he
pointed
out
the
way
and
we
marched
on
our
strange
appearance
attracted
the
attention
of
the
children
and
they
kept
coming
out
of
the
houses
to
see
the
curious
little
train
with
old
crump
carrying
the
children
and
our
poor
selves
following
along
dirty
and
ragged
bennett
dress
hardly
reached
below
her
knees
and
although
her
skirts
were
fringed
about
the
bottom
it
was
of
a
kind
that
had
not
been
adopted
as
yet
in
general
circle
of
either
or
good
united
states
society
the
shortness
of
the
dress
made
the
curious
moccasins
only
the
more
prominent
and
the
whole
of
the
party
was
a
curious
sight
we
went
down
the
hill
a
little
further
to
the
lower
bottom
to
camp
while
the
barefooted
bareheaded
urchins
followed
after
to
get
a
further
look
at
the
strangers
before
we
selected
a
suitable
place
we
saw
two
tents
and
some
wagons
which
looked
like
those
of
overland
travelers
and
we
went
toward
them
when
within
fifty
yards
two
men
suddenly
came
to
their
feet
and
looked
at
our
little
party
approaching
as
if
in
wonder
but
at
twenty
steps
they
recognized
bennett
and
came
rushing
forward
my
god
it
bennett
said
they
and
they
clasped
hands
in
silence
while
one
greeted
bennett
warmly
the
meeting
was
so
unexpected
they
shed
tears
and
quietly
led
the
way
back
to
camp
this
was
the
camp
of
moody
and
skinner
with
their
families
they
had
traveled
together
on
the
platte
and
became
well
acquainted
the
warmest
of
friends
and
knowing
that
bennett
had
taken
the
cut
off
they
more
than
suspected
he
and
his
party
had
been
lost
as
no
sight
of
them
had
come
to
their
eyes
they
had
been
waiting
here
six
weeks
in
order
to
get
some
reliable
news
and
now
bennet
answered
for
himself
rogers
and
i
belonging
to
another
party
were
of
course
strangers
leaving
them
to
compare
notes
rogers
and
i
took
charge
of
old
crump
the
oxen
and
the
mule
unpacked
them
and
arranged
camp
under
a
monstrous
willow
tree
bennett
and
his
wife
were
taken
into
tent
and
an
hour
or
so
later
when
bennett
appeared
again
she
had
her
face
washed
clean
her
hair
combed
and
a
new
clean
dress
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
found
soap
and
the
improvement
in
her
looks
and
feelings
was
surprising
bennett
looked
considerably
cleaned
up
too
and
appeared
bright
and
fresh
the
children
had
also
been
taken
in
hand
and
appeared
in
new
clothes
selected
from
the
wardrobe
of
the
other
children
and
the
old
dirty
clothes
were
put
in
process
of
washing
as
soon
as
possible
supper
came
and
it
was
so
inviting
there
was
real
bread
and
it
looked
so
nice
we
smiled
when
it
was
offered
to
us
bennett
broke
pieces
for
the
children
and
cautioned
them
not
to
eat
too
much
it
did
seem
so
good
to
be
among
friends
we
could
talk
with
and
be
understood
after
supper
was
over
and
the
things
cleared
away
we
all
sat
down
in
a
circle
and
bennett
told
the
story
of
where
he
had
been
these
many
days
on
the
cut
off
that
was
to
shorten
the
trail
moody
said
he
had
about
given
the
party
up
and
intended
to
start
up
the
coast
the
story
was
so
long
that
they
talked
till
they
were
sleepy
and
then
began
again
after
breakfast
keeping
it
up
till
they
had
a
good
outline
of
all
our
travels
and
tribulations
this
moody
his
wife
and
daughter
quinby
and
son
charles
all
lived
in
san
jose
and
are
now
dead
skinner
was
a
of
moody
and
also
lived
a
long
time
in
san
jose
but
himself
son
and
one
daughter
are
now
dead
rogers
and
i
now
took
the
we
had
borrowed
of
french
to
use
on
our
trip
to
death
valley
and
return
and
carried
it
to
the
saloon
on
the
east
side
of
the
plaza
where
we
were
to
place
it
if
we
got
back
safely
and
delivered
it
to
the
man
in
charge
with
many
thanks
to
french
for
his
favors
to
us
and
sent
him
word
that
we
would
always
remember
him
and
be
ready
to
do
him
a
similar
or
equal
favor
if
ever
we
were
able
we
considered
him
a
good
benevolent
man
and
such
he
proved
to
be
when
he
offered
us
fat
oxen
good
beans
and
any
other
thing
we
needed
he
told
the
people
in
the
house
who
we
were
which
no
doubt
influenced
them
kindly
in
our
favor
when
we
arrived
at
the
saloon
there
was
a
large
room
with
tables
in
it
and
gambling
going
on
actively
money
changed
hands
very
rapidly
drinks
at
the
bar
were
frequent
and
the
whole
affair
moved
forward
with
the
same
regularity
as
any
mercantile
business
the
door
stood
wide
open
and
any
one
could
come
and
go
at
his
pleasure
quite
a
number
of
fair
looking
women
circulated
among
the
crowd
and
this
to
us
seemed
quite
out
of
place
for
we
had
never
seen
women
in
saloons
before
we
watched
the
game
awhile
to
see
some
losing
and
some
gaining
the
result
being
quite
exciting
but
as
neither
of
us
had
any
money
we
could
not
have
joined
in
the
game
had
we
been
so
disposed
so
we
looked
on
awhile
and
then
took
a
seat
on
the
ground
outside
of
the
house
here
we
talked
over
our
chances
of
getting
to
the
mines
all
the
clothes
we
had
were
on
our
backs
and
feet
and
those
were
the
poorest
of
the
poor
we
had
no
money
i
had
the
little
mule
and
rogers
had
the
watch
arcane
had
given
him
moody
had
said
it
was
miles
to
san
francisco
and
miles
further
to
the
mines
so
that
after
the
hard
travel
of
a
year
we
were
still
a
long
way
off
from
the
place
we
started
for
we
could
not
see
any
way
to
make
a
living
here
there
was
no
land
cultivated
not
a
fence
nothing
to
require
labor
of
any
kind
the
valley
was
rich
enough
and
produced
great
crops
of
grass
and
the
cattle
and
horses
we
had
seen
grazing
seemed
to
be
about
all
the
use
they
put
it
to
it
looked
as
if
the
people
must
live
principally
on
meat
i
thought
if
we
could
manage
to
get
a
little
provision
together
such
as
flour
and
beans
that
i
could
pack
there
on
the
mule
and
i
was
pretty
sure
i
could
find
game
that
would
be
better
meat
than
we
had
lived
on
during
the
last
two
months
on
the
desert
we
looked
around
to
see
if
we
could
find
something
to
do
to
earn
a
little
for
a
start
but
were
not
successful
in
our
walk
about
this
city
of
mud
we
saw
many
things
that
seemed
strange
to
us
there
were
more
women
than
men
and
more
children
than
people
while
the
dogs
were
plenty
at
the
edge
of
the
town
near
the
river
were
some
grape
vines
fenced
in
with
living
willows
interlaced
in
some
places
with
dry
vines
the
indians
moved
very
moderately
around
and
no
doubt
had
plenty
of
beef
to
eat
with
very
few
wants
to
provide
for
we
noticed
some
few
people
paying
for
small
things
at
the
stores
with
small
money
the
women
all
dressed
much
alike
the
dress
was
of
some
cheap
material
sandals
on
feet
and
a
kind
of
long
shawl
worn
over
the
head
and
thrown
over
the
shoulder
there
seemed
to
be
neither
hoops
nor
corsets
in
their
fashions
the
men
wore
trousers
of
white
cotton
or
linen
with
a
calico
shirt
sandals
and
a
broad
rimmed
snuff
colored
hat
the
indians
and
their
wives
went
bareheaded
near
the
end
of
the
street
we
came
to
a
boarding
house
and
went
in
and
sat
down
in
the
empty
room
soon
a
man
came
in
better
dressed
than
ourselves
and
much
to
our
surprise
it
was
one
of
the
old
death
valley
travelers
the
rev
brier
whom
i
last
saw
in
his
lone
camp
in
the
desert
discoursing
to
his
young
sons
on
the
benefits
of
an
early
education
i
know
the
situation
struck
me
very
strangely
with
death
staring
them
in
the
face
and
he
preaching
we
had
a
long
talk
about
the
hard
journey
we
had
each
experienced
as
his
party
had
not
waited
they
had
come
through
ahead
of
us
he
said
himself
and
granger
had
started
a
boarding
house
when
they
arrived
and
had
been
doing
a
good
business
he
said
that
as
long
as
the
emigrants
continued
to
come
he
could
get
along
very
well
we
asked
him
if
there
was
any
chance
for
us
to
work
and
get
money
to
get
some
provisions
to
help
us
on
the
way
to
the
mines
he
said
he
could
give
work
to
one
of
us
hauling
water
for
the
house
with
oxen
and
cart
and
the
one
who
could
manage
oxen
was
the
man
i
was
an
ox
driver
and
so
told
him
i
would
take
his
team
and
cart
and
set
out
with
the
work
he
said
he
could
pay
fifty
dollars
a
month
and
i
accepted
the
offer
quickly
as
i
saw
it
was
a
good
chance
to
build
up
my
exhausted
strength
and
flesh
i
turned
the
little
mule
out
in
the
hills
near
by
and
began
my
work
it
was
not
hard
for
the
boarders
were
thinning
out
the
natives
did
not
patronize
this
hotel
very
much
but
grub
disappeared
pretty
fast
at
my
corner
of
the
table
for
my
appetite
began
to
be
ravenous
there
was
not
much
variety
to
the
food
and
very
few
luxuries
or
delicacies
which
were
hard
to
obtain
on
such
a
bare
market
but
all
seemed
satisfied
with
the
food
and
to
me
it
tasted
extra
good
rogers
went
back
to
the
old
camp
and
helped
them
there
and
i
often
went
over
after
dark
when
my
work
was
done
moody
and
skinner
had
been
active
in
trying
to
get
bennett
ready
to
go
up
the
coast
with
them
bennett
had
sold
his
repeating
rifle
and
with
the
proceeds
and
the
help
of
his
friends
had
got
another
ox
making
two
yoke
for
him
they
fixed
up
a
wagon
for
him
and
yokes
enough
could
be
found
where
people
had
traded
off
their
oxen
for
horses
provisions
enough
had
been
gathered
by
moody
and
skinner
for
them
all
and
rogers
would
go
along
with
the
party
to
help
them
with
the
teams
i
was
left
alone
after
they
started
and
it
was
my
idea
to
quit
when
i
had
worked
a
month
and
if
my
mule
staid
with
me
to
start
for
the
mines
even
if
i
went
alone
the
majority
of
the
male
inhabitants
of
this
town
had
gone
to
the
mines
and
this
accounted
for
the
unusual
proportion
of
women
we
learned
that
they
would
return
in
november
and
then
the
gambling
houses
would
start
up
in
full
blast
for
these
native
californians
seemed
to
have
a
great
natural
desire
to
indulge
in
games
of
chance
and
while
playing
their
favorite
game
of
monte
would
lay
down
their
last
reale
cents
in
the
hope
of
winning
the
money
in
sight
before
them
on
the
table
as
the
boarding
house
business
got
dull
i
was
taken
over
to
a
vineyard
and
set
to
work
in
place
of
hauling
water
the
entire
patch
was
as
green
as
a
meadow
with
weeds
and
i
was
expected
to
clean
them
out
i
inquired
of
brier
how
he
came
to
get
hold
of
this
nice
property
and
he
said
that
during
the
war
the
soldiers
had
taken
possession
of
this
piece
of
ground
and
had
their
camp
here
so
he
considered
it
was
government
land
and
therefore
had
squatted
on
it
and
was
going
to
hold
it
and
pay
for
it
as
regular
government
land
and
that
he
already
considered
it
his
own
for
said
he
i
am
an
american
and
this
is
a
part
of
the
public
domain
all
right
said
i
i
will
kill
weeds
for
you
if
you
wish
when
i
have
time
to
spare
and
you
do
want
the
oxen
worked
at
any
other
work
i
could
see
every
day
that
i
was
improving
in
health
and
weight
and
would
soon
become
myself
again
able
to
take
the
road
to
the
mines
when
about
two
weeks
of
my
time
had
expired
two
oldish
men
came
to
the
house
to
stop
for
a
few
days
and
reported
themselves
as
from
sacramento
buying
up
some
horses
for
that
market
thus
far
they
had
purchased
only
six
or
eight
as
they
had
found
the
price
too
high
to
buy
and
then
drive
so
far
to
a
market
to
sell
again
they
had
about
decided
to
go
back
with
what
they
had
and
undertake
some
other
kind
of
business
i
thought
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
chance
for
me
to
go
as
i
would
have
company
and
so
went
to
brier
and
granger
and
told
them
what
i
would
like
to
do
and
that
with
their
permission
i
would
quit
and
go
on
with
them
they
readily
consented
for
their
money
was
coming
in
rather
slow
and
they
paid
me
twenty
five
dollars
for
half
a
month
work
this
made
me
feel
pretty
rich
and
i
thought
this
would
give
me
food
enough
to
reach
the
mines
having
two
or
three
days
to
get
ready
in
i
began
doing
the
best
i
could
i
found
an
old
saddle
tree
which
had
been
thrown
away
and
managed
to
fix
it
up
so
i
could
use
it
i
also
found
an
old
gun
some
traveler
had
left
and
with
a
little
work
i
fitted
the
breech
of
that
to
my
own
gun
which
was
broken
and
had
been
roughly
tied
together
with
strips
of
i
now
had
a
good
sound
gun
if
it
was
not
very
handsome
i
bought
a
spanish
blanket
not
so
wide
as
ours
but
coarse
and
strong
and
having
a
hole
in
the
center
through
which
to
put
the
head
and
wear
it
as
a
garment
in
case
of
storm
or
at
night
i
went
to
a
native
store
and
bought
a
supply
of
carné
seca
dried
beef
and
some
crackers
put
some
salt
in
my
pocket
and
was
now
provisioned
for
another
trip
i
found
my
mule
in
the
hills
back
of
town
not
far
from
where
i
left
her
and
the
rest
and
good
feed
had
made
her
look
better
and
feel
better
as
well
as
myself
the
drovers
had
found
two
other
men
who
wanted
to
go
with
them
and
help
drive
the
horses
for
their
board
i
put
my
blanket
on
under
the
saddle
packed
my
little
sack
of
meat
and
crackers
on
behind
and
when
i
was
in
the
saddle
with
my
gun
before
me
i
considered
i
was
pretty
well
fixed
and
able
to
make
my
way
against
almost
anything
i
said
to
myself
that
the
only
way
now
to
keep
me
from
getting
to
the
gold
mines
was
to
kill
me
i
felt
that
there
was
not
a
mountain
so
high
i
could
not
climb
and
no
desert
so
wide
and
dry
that
i
could
not
cross
it
i
had
walked
and
starved
and
choked
and
lived
through
it
and
now
i
felt
so
strong
and
brave
i
could
do
it
again
any
way
to
reach
the
gold
mines
and
get
some
of
the
dust
i
had
not
much
idea
how
the
gold
from
the
mines
looked
everybody
called
it
gold
dust
and
that
conveyed
an
idea
to
me
that
it
was
fine
as
flour
but
how
to
catch
it
i
did
not
know
i
knew
other
people
found
a
way
to
get
it
and
i
knew
i
could
learn
if
any
body
could
it
was
a
great
longing
that
came
to
me
to
see
some
of
the
yellow
dust
in
its
native
state
before
it
had
been
through
the
mint
at
the
last
meal
i
took
at
the
house
there
were
only
a
few
at
the
table
among
them
was
a
well
dressed
californian
who
evidently
did
not
greatly
fancy
american
cooking
but
got
along
very
well
till
brier
brought
around
the
dessert
a
sort
of
duff
this
the
californian
tasted
a
few
times
and
then
laid
down
his
spoon
saying
it
was
no
bueno
and
some
other
words
i
did
not
then
understand
but
afterward
learned
that
they
meant
too
much
grease
the
fellow
left
the
table
not
well
pleased
with
what
we
generally
consider
the
best
end
of
a
yankee
dinner
the
last
plate
while
here
i
had
slept
in
a
small
store
room
where
i
made
my
pallet
out
of
old
rags
and
blankets
while
i
was
looking
round
for
material
to
make
my
bed
i
came
across
a
bag
partly
full
of
sugar
brought
from
chili
it
was
in
very
coarse
crystals
some
as
large
as
corn
there
were
some
other
treasures
end
luxuries
there
that
perhaps
i
was
expected
guard
i
however
had
a
sweet
tooth
and
a
handful
or
so
of
the
sweet
crystals
found
their
way
into
my
pocket
i
bade
brier
and
the
rest
good
bye
and
rode
away
to
join
my
company
chapter
xii
leaving
the
little
party
whose
wanderings
we
have
followed
so
closely
safely
arrived
in
los
angeles
their
further
history
in
california
will
be
taken
up
later
on
and
this
narrative
will
go
back
to
points
when
the
original
party
was
broken
up
and
trace
the
little
bands
in
their
varied
experience
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
author
and
his
friends
after
a
perilous
voyage
down
green
river
halted
at
the
camp
of
the
indian
chief
walker
and
there
separated
the
author
and
four
companions
striking
for
salt
lake
while
mcmahon
and
field
remained
behind
fully
determined
to
go
on
down
the
river
the
story
of
these
two
men
is
told
by
mcmahon
in
the
following
interesting
letter
dear
manley
yours
requesting
me
to
give
you
a
synopsis
of
the
history
of
incidents
experience
and
observations
of
our
mutual
friend
richard
field
and
myself
from
the
time
you
john
rogers
alfred
walton
and
the
hazelrig
brothers
left
us
at
the
camp
of
the
generous
old
chief
walker
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
near
the
mouth
of
the
great
seven
days
cañon
is
at
hand
you
no
doubt
distinctly
and
with
pleasure
remember
that
unbroken
friendship
which
existed
among
us
up
to
the
time
of
our
separation
and
that
we
parted
warm
and
tried
friends
well
after
you
and
your
companions
had
left
us
we
set
to
work
to
prepare
the
canvas
for
the
continuation
of
the
voyage
down
the
river
we
drilled
holes
through
the
sides
of
the
pilot
you
i
have
no
doubt
remember
which
that
was
yours
and
mine
in
which
we
took
so
many
fearful
risks
and
no
so
that
we
might
in
case
of
necessity
lash
the
two
together
after
a
day
or
two
field
lost
courage
and
finally
determined
to
go
no
further
down
the
river
walker
in
the
meantime
had
repeated
his
friendly
warnings
appertaining
to
the
great
danger
in
going
further
down
the
river
you
will
remember
what
he
had
told
us
about
it
before
you
left
us
you
know
that
i
was
the
biggest
coward
of
the
whole
seven
but
i
assumed
courage
and
told
field
that
i
would
go
down
the
river
alone
and
for
a
time
i
thought
i
would
do
so
but
after
some
reflection
i
concluded
that
perhaps
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
and
reluctantly
gave
it
up
we
now
decided
to
follow
you
or
to
take
some
other
unknown
route
and
try
to
make
our
escape
out
of
this
most
perilous
condition
we
then
set
about
as
you
had
done
to
trade
with
walker
for
a
pony
or
two
and
after
much
dickering
field
succeeded
in
getting
the
afterwards
famous
big
old
mule
you
may
not
remember
him
but
i
do
and
notwithstanding
his
sore
back
he
made
pretty
good
beef
i
with
pins
needles
thread
a
a
handkerchief
succeeded
in
getting
a
very
nice
round
pony
after
making
and
getting
almost
ready
to
start
we
were
through
walker
kindness
and
persuasiveness
overcome
and
consented
to
go
with
him
feeling
confident
that
we
would
not
starve
to
death
while
with
him
we
did
not
now
have
manley
with
his
long
experience
and
his
old
rusty
but
always
trusty
rifle
as
a
sure
defence
against
possible
hunger
and
starvation
the
old
chief
and
in
fact
the
whole
tribe
seemed
pleased
when
we
consented
to
go
with
them
preparations
were
now
made
and
all
except
the
horses
and
four
head
of
cattle
was
conveyed
across
the
river
in
the
two
canoes
which
were
lashed
together
while
the
horses
and
cattle
were
forced
to
swim
to
the
other
side
where
we
camped
for
the
night
next
morning
the
clever
old
chief
had
two
good
horses
fitted
up
in
good
style
for
field
and
i
which
we
rode
all
of
the
nine
days
that
we
remained
with
the
band
while
our
own
run
with
the
herd
our
baggage
was
carried
on
some
of
the
chief
we
were
in
fact
his
honored
guests
as
will
hereafter
appear
all
were
soon
mounted
and
off
to
the
buffalo
fields
walker
having
informed
us
that
he
intended
going
up
into
the
buffalo
country
on
the
of
grand
river
where
he
would
remain
until
snow
fell
when
he
would
go
to
salt
lake
city
or
vicinity
leaving
the
river
we
set
out
across
a
not
entirely
barren
plain
for
there
was
much
and
several
varieties
of
cactus
towards
evening
we
came
close
up
to
the
foot
of
a
range
of
rugged
rocky
mountains
where
we
found
water
and
camped
for
the
night
field
and
i
usually
pitched
our
little
muslin
tent
somewhere
near
our
friends
where
we
could
sleep
without
fear
of
man
or
beast
for
i
think
some
one
of
the
reds
was
always
on
guard
all
went
well
for
four
or
five
days
when
we
all
got
entirely
out
of
food
except
a
few
ounces
of
flour
which
we
had
hidden
away
for
a
possible
emergency
during
the
following
two
days
and
nights
all
were
entirely
without
food
except
the
two
little
children
whom
you
no
doubt
remember
we
gave
their
mother
a
little
flour
now
and
then
which
she
mixed
with
a
little
milk
which
one
of
the
cows
afforded
for
the
little
ones
these
indians
did
not
seem
to
suffer
for
want
of
food
even
when
we
were
starving
they
appeared
happy
and
contented
and
one
young
fellow
would
sing
all
day
long
while
we
were
starving
daring
the
second
day
of
starvation
and
hard
traveling
over
hot
and
barren
deserts
the
indians
killed
a
and
two
small
rabbits
we
got
nothing
you
will
remember
that
all
the
arms
of
the
seven
men
were
lost
in
the
river
when
the
canoes
were
sunk
except
your
rifle
and
my
double
barreled
and
revolver
so
that
field
and
i
had
only
the
one
gun
and
neither
of
us
knew
anything
about
hunting
when
we
camped
one
of
the
boys
brought
over
to
our
tent
a
quarter
of
the
cat
which
was
more
than
a
fair
share
of
the
whole
supply
as
of
them
had
only
the
two
little
rabbits
and
three
quarters
of
the
unfortunate
cat
we
boiled
and
boiled
and
boiled
that
cat
hind
leg
but
never
got
it
done
we
waited
as
long
as
we
possibly
could
gave
up
in
despair
and
put
a
little
flour
into
the
broth
to
thicken
it
and
drank
it
it
was
not
good
but
much
better
the
meat
of
the
cat
that
cat
and
the
rabbits
were
all
the
of
us
had
to
eat
after
fasting
two
days
until
late
in
the
evening
of
the
next
day
my
people
were
religious
and
when
i
was
young
the
family
was
wont
to
observe
fast
days
but
never
did
we
have
any
such
long
fasts
as
these
were
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
the
old
chief
left
the
caravan
and
went
on
ahead
of
the
train
toward
a
chain
of
mountains
first
giving
some
directions
to
the
band
and
taking
one
son
with
him
when
we
arrived
in
a
small
cañon
in
the
edge
of
the
mountains
we
found
them
with
a
fine
mountain
sheep
which
they
had
killed
and
brought
down
to
the
dim
trail
where
we
camped
and
after
we
had
set
up
our
little
tent
as
usual
a
short
distance
away
from
our
friends
one
of
the
young
men
brought
to
us
about
one
fourth
of
the
sheep
while
the
indians
had
the
rest
you
know
that
a
mountain
sheep
would
make
a
fair
supper
for
people
even
though
they
had
been
starving
three
or
four
days
but
this
was
a
small
one
and
i
think
field
and
i
ate
about
half
of
the
quarter
the
indians
soon
devoured
the
and
all
of
the
soft
viscera
including
the
stomach
and
intestines
after
which
some
of
the
boys
came
to
our
tent
while
we
were
stuffing
our
what
had
been
for
several
days
empty
stomachs
we
offered
them
part
of
our
bounteous
supply
of
mutton
having
much
more
than
we
could
eat
but
no
they
would
not
touch
it
until
we
were
filled
full
when
they
accepted
what
was
left
and
soon
stowed
it
away
all
were
now
pretty
well
filled
up
once
more
the
next
day
was
spent
without
food
traveling
over
rough
mountains
within
a
pass
late
in
the
afternoon
we
crossed
the
fresh
trail
of
some
other
band
of
roving
and
walker
suspected
who
they
were
and
went
into
camp
early
the
indians
had
killed
nothing
that
day
but
i
had
killed
a
small
rabbit
which
unfortunately
for
it
came
in
my
way
during
the
day
this
we
offered
to
the
women
for
themselves
and
the
little
children
but
they
positively
refused
to
accept
it
insisting
that
they
did
not
want
it
or
need
it
and
that
the
small
supply
of
milk
from
the
cow
was
quite
sufficient
for
the
little
ones
and
the
others
spurned
the
offer
to
divide
so
little
a
thing
so
we
had
it
all
to
ourselves
it
appeared
that
these
people
were
accustomed
to
go
for
long
periods
without
food
and
with
little
apparent
inconvenience
but
field
and
i
began
to
feel
as
i
suppose
tanner
felt
after
a
few
days
fasting
and
began
to
wish
that
the
old
chief
would
get
hungry
and
kill
one
of
his
large
fat
steers
but
he
still
held
them
in
reserve
early
the
next
morning
now
nine
days
from
the
time
we
had
left
the
river
the
old
chief
took
two
of
the
young
men
and
left
camp
as
we
afterwards
learned
to
go
in
search
of
the
indians
whose
trail
we
had
crossed
the
evening
before
some
time
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
one
of
the
young
men
returned
and
informed
us
that
they
had
found
the
wandering
tribe
and
that
we
were
to
go
back
to
their
trail
and
follow
it
to
their
camp
up
in
a
southeast
direction
walker
and
one
of
the
young
men
having
remained
with
their
friends
field
and
i
both
felt
greatly
disappointed
in
not
being
able
to
proceed
north
and
in
the
meantime
we
had
become
very
tired
of
the
society
of
these
people
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
were
exceedingly
clever
but
we
were
almost
starved
to
death
and
had
about
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
would
be
obliged
to
make
some
change
we
were
still
on
the
east
side
of
and
considerable
distance
from
the
river
and
probably
not
more
than
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
from
the
place
where
we
parted
from
you
the
chief
had
sent
particular
instructions
for
us
to
go
with
the
tribe
but
after
canvassing
the
whole
situation
we
decided
to
part
company
with
our
good
friends
proceed
northward
and
try
to
reach
fort
bridger
or
some
other
settlement
in
the
northwest
and
so
informed
them
and
requested
the
boys
to
bring
in
our
mule
and
horse
which
they
did
after
failing
to
induce
us
to
go
with
them
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
they
all
even
the
polygamous
wives
and
little
children
in
apparent
sorrow
bade
us
and
were
off
leaving
us
alone
with
our
two
poor
lonely
companions
who
were
very
anxious
to
follow
the
band
of
horses
after
the
rather
melancholy
parting
we
arranged
our
packs
and
about
ten
started
out
on
what
then
seemed
and
afterwards
proved
to
be
a
perilous
voyage
through
deserts
and
over
rough
mountains
to
avoid
a
high
range
of
mountains
our
course
was
for
a
time
northeast
but
after
passing
that
range
we
bore
to
the
northwest
the
days
were
quite
warm
but
the
nights
were
cold
during
the
first
day
we
killed
and
ate
one
small
rabbit
and
this
with
a
few
seed
buds
gathered
from
wild
rose
bushes
constituted
two
days
rations
on
the
third
we
did
not
have
even
the
rabbit
or
rose
seed
buds
but
late
in
the
afternoon
we
found
some
small
red
berries
similar
in
appearance
to
what
i
in
my
childhood
knew
and
relished
as
solomon
seal
berries
i
being
a
natural
coward
and
fearing
that
they
might
poison
me
did
not
eat
any
of
them
but
generously
allowed
my
good
friend
to
eat
them
all
we
had
now
been
almost
entirely
without
water
for
two
days
and
nights
when
night
came
on
we
picketed
our
animals
in
a
grass
plot
and
lay
down
near
them
to
see
that
they
did
not
get
tangled
in
the
ropes
and
hurt
or
that
some
red
skin
not
having
the
fear
of
the
lord
in
his
heart
did
not
come
and
take
them
away
about
ten
my
companion
began
to
complain
of
pain
in
his
stomach
and
bowels
and
was
soon
vomiting
at
a
fearful
rate
so
violently
indeed
that
i
was
apprehensive
that
he
might
die
if
i
had
had
an
emetic
i
would
have
given
it
to
him
to
have
assisted
nature
in
pumping
those
devilish
little
red
berries
out
of
him
for
i
felt
quite
sure
that
they
were
the
cause
of
his
illness
perhaps
it
was
fortunate
that
there
was
no
medecine
at
hand
for
if
there
had
been
i
might
have
killed
him
with
it
he
suffered
most
intensely
and
soon
became
very
thirsty
and
there
being
no
water
within
many
miles
of
us
he
appealed
to
me
to
bleed
one
of
the
animals
and
let
him
drink
the
blood
i
refused
he
insisted
i
again
refused
he
commanded
i
still
refused
he
swore
and
called
me
almost
everything
except
a
good
christian
he
even
expressed
the
wish
that
i
his
friend
might
be
sent
to
a
certain
place
where
the
heat
is
most
intense
and
the
fire
is
never
quenched
at
about
eleven
when
his
pains
were
most
severe
a
dark
cloud
the
first
we
had
seen
for
months
came
over
us
and
a
little
rain
began
to
fall
when
i
at
once
opened
our
little
camp
kettle
and
turned
the
lid
upside
down
and
into
both
kettle
and
lid
there
fell
perhaps
two
or
three
teaspoonfuls
of
pure
water
every
drop
of
which
i
gave
to
the
sufferer
whereupon
he
expressed
thanks
for
another
and
at
once
apologized
for
bestowing
unmerited
abuse
on
me
he
afterwards
often
asserted
that
he
believed
that
the
little
was
sent
by
god
for
his
special
benefit
and
that
the
water
caught
from
that
cloud
was
the
sweetest
and
best
that
he
had
ever
tasted
i
did
not
doubt
the
latter
half
of
the
above
statement
but
i
did
have
some
doubt
about
the
truth
of
the
former
half
when
i
called
to
mind
the
scene
which
followed
my
refusal
to
bleed
the
horse
whether
the
small
quantity
of
water
gave
him
much
relief
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
know
that
he
soon
became
better
and
slept
some
while
i
watched
he
was
quite
feeble
next
morning
when
i
put
him
on
the
old
mule
where
he
rode
most
of
the
time
for
the
next
four
days
while
the
little
horse
carried
our
baggage
and
i
led
the
way
as
usual
on
foot
for
four
days
from
the
time
field
ate
the
little
red
berries
we
did
not
have
a
drop
of
water
except
the
two
or
three
teaspoonfuls
which
the
stingy
cloud
left
to
save
the
life
of
the
we
were
still
on
the
desert
or
in
the
mountains
east
of
the
river
traveling
hard
during
the
day
and
burning
up
with
fever
in
the
night
there
was
plenty
of
drying
grass
in
places
but
our
poor
animals
could
not
eat
it
any
longer
for
they
too
were
burning
up
for
want
of
water
oh
how
much
i
did
wish
that
we
had
some
camels
from
arabia
which
could
have
gone
so
much
longer
without
water
and
traveled
so
much
faster
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
of
starvation
we
determined
to
change
our
course
and
if
possible
reach
the
river
once
more
bearing
to
the
left
over
a
high
barren
range
of
rocky
mountains
and
down
into
a
plain
of
sand
sage
brush
and
cactus
during
the
afternoon
i
shot
a
small
rabbit
not
much
larger
than
a
rat
which
we
carried
until
night
then
broiled
and
tried
to
eat
it
not
because
our
appetites
craved
it
but
hoping
that
it
might
strengthen
and
sustain
us
at
least
a
little
while
longer
we
were
however
so
nearly
burned
up
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
flow
of
saliva
to
moisten
the
little
bits
of
broiled
meat
in
the
mouth
late
that
afternoon
we
fancied
that
our
fast
failing
brute
companions
scented
water
or
that
they
instinctively
knew
that
it
was
not
far
away
they
would
raise
their
heads
and
extend
their
noses
as
if
smelling
while
their
physical
force
and
energy
seemed
renewed
and
they
certainly
traveled
faster
that
night
we
ate
the
little
as
before
stated
more
as
a
duty
than
as
a
pleasure
there
was
some
green
grass
round
about
where
we
camped
or
more
properly
speaking
where
we
lay
for
we
did
not
erect
our
little
tent
but
the
poor
starving
animals
did
not
eat
a
bite
of
it
but
stood
over
us
as
if
in
sympathy
with
us
in
our
deplorable
condition
we
rose
before
the
sun
being
somewhat
rested
and
refreshed
for
the
night
had
been
cool
and
took
up
our
line
of
march
i
as
usual
in
the
lead
then
came
the
old
mule
guided
by
its
precious
owner
and
lastly
the
faithful
little
horse
with
the
pack
on
his
still
quite
round
back
on
over
the
still
dry
and
barren
plain
we
went
without
a
moses
cloud
or
pillar
of
fire
to
lead
us
about
ten
through
the
hot
glimmer
of
the
rays
of
the
sun
we
saw
what
appeared
and
afterwards
proved
to
be
a
clump
of
cottonwood
trees
our
hopes
and
courage
were
renewed
for
we
well
knew
the
cottonwood
usually
grows
near
flowing
water
there
was
no
beaten
pathway
no
signs
of
animal
life
no
quails
no
manna
in
that
desert
but
on
we
went
almost
without
a
halt
and
at
one
reached
the
cottonwood
grove
immediately
on
the
bank
of
the
great
river
down
which
we
had
floated
in
our
canoes
more
than
a
month
before
on
reaching
the
bank
of
the
river
we
recognized
objects
which
we
had
seen
while
on
our
way
down
we
remembered
that
both
men
and
horses
might
be
and
that
is
said
to
be
the
first
law
of
nature
but
it
was
difficult
to
prevent
the
famishing
brutes
from
plunging
into
the
river
we
allowed
them
to
take
only
a
small
quantity
at
first
and
each
of
us
took
only
a
small
cupful
then
after
a
little
time
all
took
more
and
the
thirst
was
soon
quenched
we
were
surprised
to
find
how
little
water
it
took
to
satisfy
the
raging
thirst
of
four
days
of
continued
fasting
the
animals
after
taking
comparatively
small
quantities
seemed
satisfied
and
went
off
in
search
of
grass
we
now
had
an
abundance
of
water
but
we
well
knew
that
water
alone
would
not
sustain
life
very
long
therefore
our
next
and
most
serious
business
was
to
determine
how
to
prolong
our
lives
according
to
our
map
our
recollections
of
different
objects
and
present
appearances
we
were
now
a
little
above
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
river
which
comes
in
from
the
northwest
all
of
which
proved
true
our
little
map
pictured
fort
uinta
on
the
uinta
river
about
one
hundred
miles
from
where
we
were
but
whether
or
not
there
were
any
human
beings
there
we
did
not
know
and
in
order
to
determine
we
must
cross
this
great
river
and
travel
a
hundred
miles
and
this
seemed
a
perilous
undertaking
for
us
in
our
present
starving
condition
but
after
being
refreshed
by
plenty
of
good
water
we
determined
to
undertake
it
hoping
that
good
fortune
might
attend
us
after
a
little
rest
the
animals
with
grass
we
packed
up
and
after
field
had
put
on
his
once
serviceable
life
preserver
he
mounted
the
old
mule
behind
the
small
pack
and
started
to
swim
across
the
river
he
took
the
lead
in
this
instance
for
three
reasons
first
we
thought
that
the
mule
being
much
older
than
the
horse
had
probably
had
more
experience
and
therefore
might
be
a
much
better
swimmer
then
field
had
the
advantage
in
having
the
life
preserver
but
the
last
and
most
potent
reason
was
my
fear
of
getting
drowned
it
was
understood
that
i
was
to
remain
on
shore
and
be
ready
to
assist
him
if
necessary
or
until
he
had
safely
landed
on
the
other
side
in
he
went
and
the
trusty
old
mule
was
swimming
faithfully
and
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
when
field
as
he
afterwards
told
me
to
hurry
the
mule
gave
a
gentle
jerk
on
the
bridle
when
to
his
utter
astonishment
the
mule
made
a
complete
somerset
backwards
plunging
field
the
pack
and
himself
entirely
under
the
water
except
his
heels
which
appeared
above
the
water
as
his
head
went
under
in
a
moment
field
popped
up
and
after
shaking
his
head
as
a
swimmer
will
do
after
taking
a
plunge
cast
about
to
take
his
bearings
or
to
determine
just
where
he
was
and
began
to
paddle
with
his
hands
much
as
he
did
when
the
canoes
were
upset
on
the
river
or
somewhat
after
the
style
of
a
swimming
dog
on
coming
to
the
surface
the
mule
cast
a
glance
at
the
still
living
but
unloaded
portion
of
his
cargo
then
made
a
bee
line
for
the
shore
which
he
had
so
recently
left
while
field
continued
to
paddle
and
float
down
the
river
i
dismounted
and
followed
along
the
bank
trying
to
encourage
him
to
renewed
efforts
to
float
ashore
finally
he
passed
behind
a
clump
of
willows
out
of
sight
but
soon
i
heard
him
call
for
help
and
on
going
a
little
further
down
found
him
stuck
fast
in
the
mud
i
waded
waist
deep
into
that
mud
and
literally
dragged
him
out
almost
a
mile
below
his
starting
point
as
we
were
struggling
in
this
muddy
swamp
field
said
he
wondered
why
some
of
this
superfluous
water
was
not
distributed
over
those
dry
deserts
from
which
we
had
so
recently
come
i
told
him
politely
that
i
thought
that
a
man
of
his
age
ability
opportunities
and
nationality
you
know
he
was
quite
proud
of
being
an
englishman
ought
to
know
why
the
moisture
was
not
so
distributed
and
that
i
was
too
illiterate
to
enlighten
him
on
that
point
but
that
when
opportunity
offered
he
might
consult
some
one
who
knew
more
of
natural
science
than
i
did
i
informed
him
that
i
had
an
idea
that
if
any
considerable
portion
of
the
water
of
that
river
had
been
distributed
over
that
desert
that
we
would
not
have
had
the
experience
of
the
last
fifteen
days
whereupon
he
very
plainly
intimated
that
i
did
not
have
much
sense
or
in
other
words
he
called
me
a
d
d
fool
after
reaching
solid
ground
and
resting
for
a
little
while
we
returned
to
the
place
from
which
he
had
started
out
on
his
perilous
voyage
and
where
i
had
hastily
left
my
horse
we
found
the
horse
and
mule
quietly
grazing
with
their
packs
on
their
backs
the
faithful
old
mule
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
wet
but
was
now
almost
dry
yet
not
so
dry
internally
as
he
had
been
several
days
before
what
shall
we
do
now
we
are
perhaps
two
hundred
or
more
miles
from
any
white
settlement
we
do
not
know
that
fort
uinta
is
occupied
shall
we
make
another
attempt
to
cross
the
river
i
asked
my
brave
friend
if
he
was
willing
to
again
mount
the
mule
and
make
another
attempt
when
he
again
exclaimed
you
must
be
a
d
d
fool
i
then
pretending
to
have
a
little
courage
asked
him
if
he
would
follow
provided
i
would
lead
whereupon
he
declared
most
emphatically
that
under
no
conditions
would
he
again
attempt
to
swim
across
that
river
i
had
not
had
his
experience
but
fear
of
being
drowned
was
quite
sufficient
to
prevent
me
from
undertaking
the
perilous
task
more
especially
after
witnessing
his
failure
well
what
next
we
could
not
depend
upon
fishing
and
hunting
for
we
had
no
nor
means
of
catching
fish
and
not
more
than
a
dozen
loads
of
shot
and
a
little
powder
so
the
matter
of
slaying
one
of
our
animal
friends
was
now
seriously
debated
and
after
thoroughly
canvassing
the
whole
situation
it
was
most
reluctantly
determined
that
however
hard
this
must
be
done
no
doubt
our
starving
condition
at
that
particular
time
had
some
weight
in
making
this
decision
then
the
question
was
which
of
the
animals
shall
be
sacrificed
the
mule
was
quite
thin
and
probably
tough
while
the
little
horse
was
young
and
notwithstanding
the
many
days
it
had
with
all
of
us
starved
and
traveled
without
water
was
still
quite
plump
and
round
and
probably
tender
or
at
the
worst
not
so
tough
as
the
poor
old
docile
mule
so
at
length
we
decided
to
kill
the
innocent
little
creature
jerk
his
flesh
pack
it
on
the
mule
and
thereby
try
to
save
our
own
lives
for
a
time
at
least
and
endeavor
to
reach
some
place
of
safety
the
matter
of
slaying
the
horse
was
determined
by
casting
lots
neither
being
willing
to
perform
that
melancholy
but
now
absolutely
necessary
act
it
fell
to
my
lot
and
that
was
one
of
if
not
the
most
revolting
act
in
my
whole
life
experience
for
i
had
probably
become
as
strongly
attached
to
that
little
horse
as
man
ever
becomes
attached
to
animal
i
most
reluctantly
took
the
bridle
in
my
left
hand
my
revolver
in
my
right
stood
directly
in
front
of
the
poor
unsuspecting
innocent
creature
with
the
murderous
pistol
close
to
and
a
little
above
a
line
extending
from
eye
to
eye
and
fired
when
the
smoke
of
the
powder
had
cleared
off
a
little
i
saw
at
my
feet
the
quivering
dying
body
i
staggered
off
a
few
steps
and
sat
down
sick
at
heart
field
walked
several
steps
away
and
turned
his
back
upon
the
scene
until
after
the
fatal
shot
had
been
fired
then
after
some
little
time
he
entered
upon
his
share
of
the
enforced
duty
and
after
having
removed
a
portion
of
the
skin
cut
off
some
slices
of
flesh
and
brought
them
to
a
fire
i
had
started
we
broiled
and
ate
a
little
of
it
not
through
desire
or
relish
for
it
but
from
a
sense
of
duty
knowing
that
our
lives
depended
upon
it
it
is
said
that
for
many
years
franklin
refrained
from
eating
flesh
having
an
idea
that
it
was
wrong
to
slay
and
eat
the
flesh
of
other
creatures
but
that
he
changed
his
mind
and
his
diet
too
after
having
seen
large
fish
devour
small
ones
i
strongly
suspect
that
if
the
doctor
had
been
with
us
or
in
a
like
condition
even
before
his
conversion
he
would
more
than
likely
have
taken
a
little
flesh
even
though
it
had
been
a
piece
of
his
own
favorite
horse
i
said
we
only
ate
a
little
at
first
i
only
ate
a
little
for
two
reason
first
i
did
not
relish
the
food
second
i
had
heard
of
persons
being
killed
by
eating
too
much
after
fasting
for
a
long
time
and
i
had
no
desire
to
commit
suicide
just
then
field
ate
too
much
night
came
on
work
was
suspended
and
we
retired
the
poor
old
lone
and
no
doubt
now
lonely
mule
having
filled
himself
with
grass
came
up
near
the
now
remains
of
his
late
companion
and
looked
on
as
field
continued
his
bloody
work
field
with
an
expression
of
sorrow
said
if
that
mule
could
reason
and
look
forward
to
the
time
when
his
body
might
be
in
a
like
condition
as
that
of
this
horse
he
would
no
doubt
take
to
his
heels
bid
us
a
final
farewell
and
seek
other
society
but
fortunately
for
us
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
to
be
held
in
reserve
for
our
future
security
he
was
securely
tied
up
every
night
from
that
time
until
the
day
he
was
slain
for
our
salvation
early
in
the
night
following
that
eventful
day
my
companion
began
to
complain
much
as
he
had
done
on
the
night
after
he
had
eaten
the
little
red
berries
but
there
was
no
lack
of
water
now
no
need
of
a
special
i
got
up
heated
water
in
our
little
camp
kettle
applied
hot
cloths
to
his
aching
belly
and
did
everything
else
that
either
of
us
could
think
of
for
his
relief
the
pain
was
intense
and
we
feared
that
he
would
surely
die
and
earnestly
prayed
all
the
rest
of
the
night
that
he
might
be
relieved
and
get
well
towards
morning
most
violent
vomiting
came
on
which
continued
for
thirty
hours
or
more
he
was
not
able
to
walk
for
three
days
and
during
that
time
i
nursed
him
finished
jerking
the
meat
and
built
a
raft
of
some
partly
rotten
logs
which
i
found
in
the
vicinity
on
which
we
floated
across
the
river
on
the
fourth
day
after
our
arrival
here
i
also
looked
to
the
welfare
of
the
mule
and
prepared
some
bags
in
which
to
carry
our
jerk
manley
i
am
sure
that
you
know
the
meaning
of
the
term
jerk
so
that
a
definition
of
the
word
is
not
at
all
necessary
the
old
logs
of
which
the
raft
was
made
were
remnants
of
log
cabins
a
number
of
which
had
been
built
and
occupied
more
than
half
a
century
before
but
by
whom
i
do
not
know
field
remarked
that
the
finding
of
these
old
rotting
logs
there
was
another
god
send
as
we
then
had
neither
ax
hammer
nor
any
tool
of
iron
with
which
to
cut
down
a
tree
i
bound
these
logs
together
with
long
strips
cut
from
the
hide
of
the
dead
horse
paddles
and
poles
were
also
provided
the
mule
was
with
difficulty
driven
across
the
river
when
the
raft
was
landed
on
the
west
bank
the
mule
packed
and
all
about
ready
to
start
i
took
the
long
strip
of
from
the
raft
and
tied
one
end
of
it
around
the
mule
neck
mounted
field
on
the
mule
behind
the
large
pack
which
made
the
whole
outfit
look
quite
comical
indeed
before
leaving
the
other
side
of
the
river
i
had
discovered
that
the
saddle
girth
was
not
very
strong
so
i
cut
a
wide
belt
from
the
hide
of
the
lately
slaughtered
horse
and
fitted
it
to
the
saddle
as
a
girth
knowing
that
the
pack
now
containing
all
of
our
goods
and
a
supply
of
more
than
a
bushel
of
jerk
would
be
quite
bulky
if
not
heavy
and
more
difficult
to
keep
on
the
back
of
a
mule
than
it
is
for
the
camel
to
maintain
his
hump
on
his
back
this
girth
afterwards
made
us
two
or
three
pretty
substantial
meals
as
did
also
the
long
strip
of
green
wet
hide
one
end
of
which
i
had
tied
round
the
mule
neck
allowing
it
to
drag
for
a
long
distance
through
the
hot
dry
sand
all
being
ready
i
as
usual
took
the
lead
with
my
shot
gun
which
i
always
carried
but
with
which
i
seldom
killed
anything
on
my
shoulder
the
old
mule
followed
with
his
high
towering
pack
and
field
almost
hidden
behind
it
was
noon
but
we
did
not
stop
for
dinner
but
simply
reached
into
one
of
the
great
bulging
sacks
took
out
a
piece
of
jerk
and
ate
it
as
we
went
marching
on
no
more
trouble
now
about
cooking
late
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
uinta
river
and
as
my
companion
had
grown
very
tired
of
the
back
of
the
one
we
went
into
camp
early
our
objective
point
was
fort
uinta
where
we
hoped
to
find
military
we
could
not
risk
turning
the
mule
loose
at
night
and
the
long
strip
of
was
designed
and
used
to
secure
him
and
yet
to
afford
him
liberty
to
graze
while
we
slept
as
you
will
see
a
little
further
on
both
girth
and
lariat
were
used
for
a
purpose
not
anticipated
the
second
third
fourth
and
fifth
days
came
and
went
and
we
were
trudging
on
up
the
uinta
through
a
mostly
very
barren
country
with
some
little
rich
and
fertile
land
we
saw
signs
of
indians
often
but
no
indians
there
was
much
cottonwood
but
little
other
timber
we
saw
some
fish
in
the
river
which
we
coveted
but
could
not
get
the
main
course
of
this
river
is
from
to
we
traveled
most
of
the
way
to
the
fort
on
indian
trails
some
of
which
were
much
worn
but
mostly
at
some
much
earlier
period
of
course
we
had
plenty
of
good
water
and
food
such
as
it
was
field
did
not
walk
two
miles
during
those
five
days
but
seemed
to
be
fattening
fast
i
sometimes
thought
he
might
be
just
a
little
lazy
but
i
never
told
him
so
for
i
realized
that
he
had
recently
had
a
severe
tussle
with
death
early
in
the
morning
of
the
sixth
day
we
arrived
at
the
abandoned
old
fort
there
were
only
three
log
buildings
and
they
were
in
the
shape
of
three
sides
of
a
hollow
square
with
on
the
outer
faces
of
the
buildings
and
doors
entering
each
of
them
from
the
hollow
square
or
court
facing
the
vacant
side
of
the
court
the
from
which
i
shot
the
wolf
on
the
night
after
we
had
killed
the
mule
would
be
on
right
hand
side
we
were
unable
to
determine
whether
this
fort
had
been
constructed
and
occupied
by
americans
or
mexicans
but
from
its
apparent
age
we
were
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
it
was
mexicans
it
had
not
been
occupied
for
probably
three
or
four
years
some
little
farming
had
been
done
immediately
around
the
fort
surrounding
the
fort
is
a
large
body
of
fine
fertile
land
which
i
have
no
doubt
has
long
since
been
occupied
by
mormons
or
other
enterprising
people
having
no
means
of
subsistence
here
we
soon
decided
to
push
on
towards
fort
bridger
and
after
resting
a
few
hours
set
out
following
the
larger
fork
of
the
river
which
comes
almost
directly
from
the
north
we
now
believed
that
we
were
almost
if
not
exactly
due
south
of
fort
bridger
the
river
is
small
and
very
crooked
we
crossed
it
many
times
within
three
days
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
found
ourselves
in
the
mouth
of
a
rocky
cañon
and
after
struggling
for
one
whole
day
we
came
to
where
the
steep
high
stone
walls
closed
the
little
river
in
on
both
sides
rendering
it
impossible
for
us
to
proceed
any
further
we
were
now
nearly
out
of
food
the
jerk
was
almost
gone
a
council
was
held
and
it
was
decided
that
we
should
return
to
the
fort
and
take
chances
of
being
rescued
or
scalped
by
some
roving
band
of
reds
or
starving
to
death
we
at
once
set
out
on
our
return
full
of
disappointment
and
melancholy
forebodings
the
next
day
found
us
without
food
and
now
came
into
use
the
long
narrow
strip
of
which
first
bound
together
the
old
rotting
logs
of
which
the
raft
was
made
then
to
secure
the
mule
of
nights
it
was
now
almost
as
hard
as
bone
and
nearly
round
having
been
dragged
through
the
hot
sand
while
it
was
yet
green
and
wet
closed
up
like
a
hollow
tube
with
sand
inside
two
or
three
yards
of
it
at
a
time
was
cut
into
pieces
about
five
inches
long
the
hair
singed
off
the
sand
scratched
out
and
these
pieces
were
dropped
into
our
camp
kettle
and
cooked
until
the
whole
formed
one
mass
of
jelly
or
gluten
which
was
to
us
quite
palatable
when
the
lasso
had
all
been
thus
prepared
and
eaten
the
broad
girth
which
had
served
so
well
in
holding
the
on
the
mule
back
was
cleaned
cooked
and
eaten
these
substitutes
for
jerk
sustained
us
very
well
till
we
again
arrived
at
the
fort
another
consultation
was
now
held
and
the
question
was
what
shall
we
do
now
we
were
again
apparently
at
the
starting
point
of
another
long
enforced
fast
our
path
seemed
hedged
in
the
prospect
was
indeed
very
gloomy
our
only
reasonable
hope
for
even
the
temporary
prolongation
of
our
lives
was
centered
in
our
ever
faithful
and
always
reliable
old
mule
we
revolted
at
the
idea
of
killing
and
eating
him
but
the
last
bit
of
the
girth
was
gone
after
canvassing
the
whole
situation
over
and
over
again
and
again
we
finally
but
most
reluctantly
decided
to
kill
the
mule
and
preserve
all
the
soft
parts
even
the
skin
with
all
of
its
old
scars
and
then
gather
in
whatever
else
we
could
find
and
stay
here
until
spring
or
until
good
fortune
might
afford
us
some
means
escape
till
some
moses
might
come
and
lead
us
out
of
this
wilderness
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
had
not
borrowed
any
jewelry
which
we
had
failed
to
return
there
were
signs
of
wolves
in
that
vicinity
and
it
was
decided
that
the
mule
be
slain
about
ten
paces
distant
and
directly
in
front
of
one
of
the
of
the
fort
with
the
idea
that
wolves
might
smell
the
blood
and
come
there
and
subject
themselves
to
being
shot
and
thereby
afford
us
a
chance
to
increase
our
stock
of
winter
supplies
in
the
form
of
wolf
steak
or
jerk
accordingly
the
victim
was
lead
to
the
spot
indicated
and
there
slain
in
the
same
manner
and
with
quite
as
much
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
slayer
as
on
the
occasion
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
little
horse
more
than
three
weeks
before
the
body
was
skinned
cut
up
and
all
taken
within
the
building
nothing
being
left
except
the
blood
which
had
been
spilled
on
the
ground
and
which
was
intended
to
attract
wolves
or
possibly
bears
or
other
animals
my
now
only
living
associate
ridiculed
the
idea
of
killing
wolves
and
insisted
that
the
flesh
could
not
be
eaten
stating
the
fact
that
even
hogs
would
not
eat
the
dead
body
of
a
dog
and
insisted
that
a
dog
was
only
a
tamed
wolf
i
reminded
him
of
a
cat
which
had
been
eaten
he
finally
agreed
that
if
i
killed
a
wolf
he
would
get
up
and
dress
it
but
said
most
emphatically
that
he
would
not
sit
up
and
watch
for
it
so
he
went
to
bed
that
is
rolled
himself
up
in
a
blanket
on
the
ground
in
front
of
a
good
fire
inside
of
the
fort
and
went
to
sleep
while
i
sat
with
my
rather
untrustworthy
double
barreled
protruding
through
the
in
full
view
of
the
spot
before
indicated
the
night
was
clear
and
the
moon
was
shining
in
full
splendor
it
was
probably
eleven
field
had
been
snoring
for
a
long
time
when
i
heard
something
in
the
tall
dry
grass
and
soon
a
large
wolf
came
into
full
view
with
head
up
apparently
sniffing
or
smelling
and
cautiously
approaching
the
fatal
spot
when
he
reached
it
and
began
to
lick
up
the
blood
which
was
still
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
standing
with
his
left
side
toward
the
fort
and
in
full
view
i
took
deliberate
aim
and
fired
and
he
fell
upon
the
ground
without
making
any
considerable
noise
the
tired
sleeping
man
was
aroused
by
the
report
of
the
gun
and
rushed
into
the
room
where
i
was
in
great
excitement
thinking
perhaps
that
some
enemy
had
appeared
and
had
just
then
commenced
to
bombard
the
fort
but
when
i
explained
to
him
that
i
had
simply
killed
a
wolf
he
ran
out
towards
it
and
arriving
close
to
it
the
wounded
creature
rose
up
on
its
hind
feet
and
growled
quite
vigorously
which
seemed
to
frighten
field
as
much
as
did
the
noise
of
the
gun
he
dashed
back
to
the
fort
and
after
having
time
to
recover
from
his
speechless
condition
abused
me
most
fearfully
for
having
told
him
that
i
had
killed
a
wolf
i
then
went
out
and
put
a
load
of
shot
into
the
head
and
found
that
my
first
charge
had
passed
through
and
broke
both
of
its
fore
legs
near
the
body
field
was
so
thoroughly
frightened
that
i
could
not
induce
him
to
approach
the
dead
animal
for
some
time
and
i
do
believe
that
that
wolf
haunted
him
as
long
as
i
knew
him
for
he
seemed
never
to
forget
it
after
dressing
it
by
the
light
of
the
moon
assisted
by
a
torch
we
retired
on
viewing
the
plump
body
next
morning
field
exclaimed
that
another
and
notwithstanding
his
opinion
that
wolf
could
not
be
eaten
he
found
that
wolf
to
be
the
best
food
we
had
eaten
since
we
had
assisted
walker
and
his
tribe
in
eating
the
mountain
sheep
the
french
may
eat
their
horses
but
i
do
not
want
more
horse
flesh
the
old
mule
made
fair
but
quite
coarse
beef
while
out
on
this
little
pleasure
excursion
we
ate
horse
mule
wolf
mountain
sheep
rose
seed
buds
a
squirrel
fatty
matter
from
the
sockets
of
the
mule
eyes
and
the
marrow
from
his
bones
but
that
ham
of
was
certainly
the
most
detestable
thing
that
i
ever
undertook
to
eat
the
marrow
from
the
mule
bones
was
a
real
luxury
we
now
had
a
pretty
good
stock
of
food
such
as
it
was
but
not
enough
to
carry
us
through
the
winter
on
full
rations
therefore
we
determined
to
try
to
add
to
it
by
hunting
one
was
to
go
out
and
hunt
while
the
other
would
remain
at
home
we
now
had
undisputed
possession
of
the
fort
and
it
was
our
home
field
took
the
first
day
outing
while
i
occupied
my
time
in
drying
and
smoking
meat
late
in
the
evening
he
returned
tired
and
worn
out
having
seen
nothing
worth
shooting
next
day
came
my
turn
to
hunt
i
took
a
lunch
as
he
had
done
consisting
of
jerked
mule
i
did
not
tell
him
so
but
i
had
determined
to
make
an
excursion
up
the
river
to
a
point
where
we
had
seen
some
fresh
trails
and
deer
tracks
some
days
before
when
i
was
putting
up
my
lunch
my
friend
intimated
that
i
was
taking
a
very
large
amount
for
one
lunch
but
i
told
him
that
i
might
stay
out
late
and
that
i
did
not
intend
to
starve
i
went
stayed
all
day
all
night
and
part
of
the
next
day
and
returned
as
he
had
done
tired
and
discouraged
not
having
seen
anything
worth
bringing
in
in
the
evening
of
the
first
day
out
i
found
a
trail
which
appeared
to
have
been
used
daily
by
deer
going
to
and
from
the
river
it
occurred
to
me
that
they
might
go
out
early
in
the
morning
so
i
secreted
myself
within
gun
shot
of
the
trail
behind
an
old
log
where
i
slept
comfortably
and
when
it
was
light
enough
in
the
morning
to
see
a
deer
i
leveled
my
gun
across
the
log
in
a
position
commanding
the
trail
and
waited
and
watched
until
nine
but
nothing
came
upon
that
pathway
that
morning
after
getting
tired
of
watching
and
waiting
i
went
down
to
the
trail
where
to
my
astonishment
i
found
the
fresh
tracks
of
a
large
bear
which
must
have
passed
by
that
way
while
i
was
sleeping
as
a
rule
i
do
not
like
to
be
treated
discourteously
but
in
this
instance
i
felt
glad
that
this
stranger
had
passed
me
by
on
arriving
at
the
fort
late
in
the
evening
i
found
my
friend
in
a
terrible
state
of
mental
excitement
he
said
that
he
had
not
slept
a
minute
during
the
whole
of
the
night
before
he
had
filled
the
door
of
his
room
with
rails
and
sharpened
one
end
of
a
long
stick
which
he
intended
to
use
if
necessary
as
a
weapon
of
defence
when
i
arrived
he
was
again
filling
the
door
with
rails
i
had
the
gun
pistol
and
big
knife
with
me
so
this
was
his
only
means
of
defence
he
said
he
would
not
stay
alone
another
night
for
all
the
gold
in
california
i
was
much
discouraged
by
our
failures
in
hunting
and
after
a
lengthy
discussion
we
decided
to
make
another
attempt
to
cross
the
mountains
and
escape
from
what
then
seemed
to
us
certain
starvation
this
was
thursday
night
and
we
set
monday
as
the
time
for
starting
by
saturday
night
everything
was
in
readiness
for
the
start
and
sunday
we
devoted
to
bible
reading
for
we
each
still
had
a
pocket
bible
as
much
of
the
flesh
of
the
wolf
and
the
lamented
mule
as
we
thought
we
could
carry
had
been
thoroughly
jerked
and
finding
that
we
would
not
be
overburdened
by
it
we
economized
by
roasting
and
eating
little
scraps
of
flesh
the
marrow
from
the
bones
and
even
the
head
of
the
mule
was
roasted
the
fragments
of
flesh
scraped
off
and
eaten
and
field
found
a
rich
fatty
substance
in
behind
the
eyes
which
he
ate
we
had
a
canteen
in
which
our
powder
was
carried
but
the
powder
was
nearly
all
gone
so
we
emptied
it
and
used
the
canteen
to
carry
water
in
early
monday
morning
we
loaded
ourselves
mostly
with
jerked
mule
and
wolf
leaving
many
useful
things
behind
bid
adieu
to
fort
uinta
and
took
up
our
line
of
march
rather
reluctantly
my
companion
was
not
strong
and
we
soon
found
it
expedient
for
me
to
take
on
part
of
his
burden
we
rested
often
and
yet
long
before
night
he
became
so
tired
that
we
had
to
go
into
camp
most
of
the
day
we
had
traveled
on
an
old
deserted
trail
the
nights
being
cold
we
were
under
the
necessity
of
keeping
up
a
fire
as
we
had
left
our
blankets
at
the
fort
the
next
morning
we
made
an
early
start
and
rested
often
at
about
noon
we
found
good
shade
and
water
and
the
sun
being
quite
hot
we
stopped
and
rested
in
the
shade
for
more
than
three
hours
then
trudged
on
till
nearly
night
when
we
found
water
and
plenty
of
old
dry
timber
for
fuel
and
camped
field
expressed
a
wish
that
he
had
his
old
mule
again
and
i
reminded
him
that
he
had
a
portion
of
it
left
in
his
knapsack
and
that
turn
about
was
fair
play
as
the
mule
had
carried
him
for
a
long
time
when
he
was
unable
to
walk
he
should
not
object
to
carrying
a
portion
of
the
mule
now
whereupon
he
again
plainly
intimated
that
he
thought
i
was
a
d
d
fool
i
kept
up
the
fire
and
he
slept
until
morning
another
day
was
passed
without
any
unusual
occurrence
we
traveled
and
ate
at
the
same
time
as
usual
another
day
of
pretty
hard
travel
over
sandy
plains
and
rocky
hills
brought
us
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
where
we
had
plenty
of
good
water
and
an
abundance
of
fuel
a
little
sprinkle
of
rain
early
in
the
evening
was
the
first
we
had
seen
since
the
memorable
night
after
field
had
eaten
the
little
red
berries
early
saturday
morning
we
filled
our
canteen
with
water
and
started
up
the
mountain
i
had
been
carrying
most
of
the
jerk
but
the
stock
was
running
down
quite
rapidly
my
companions
bag
now
being
almost
empty
and
as
he
had
little
else
to
carry
while
i
had
the
gun
and
some
other
things
including
his
heavy
overcoat
i
divided
the
jerk
putting
about
half
of
it
into
his
sack
all
day
long
we
were
climbing
the
mountain
late
in
the
afternoon
i
was
several
rods
ahead
of
field
when
he
called
to
me
to
stop
i
did
so
and
when
he
came
up
he
appeared
to
be
a
little
cross
and
insisted
that
we
were
not
traveling
in
the
direction
formerly
agreed
upon
i
requested
him
to
let
me
see
the
little
compass
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
and
on
examining
it
he
found
that
he
was
mistaken
whereupon
he
muttered
something
which
i
thought
was
swear
words
and
then
we
went
marching
on
in
a
little
while
we
were
within
the
old
snow
limits
where
we
found
large
bodies
of
old
icy
looking
snow
in
places
shaded
by
trees
and
rocks
and
a
little
before
dark
went
into
camp
we
gathered
some
old
dry
timber
and
made
a
large
fire
then
some
green
fir
limbs
for
a
bed
when
i
began
to
prepare
our
bed
on
one
side
of
the
flaming
logs
to
my
surprise
field
began
to
prepare
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
neither
had
spoken
since
the
occurrence
of
the
little
unpleasantness
in
the
afternoon
about
the
course
of
travel
mutely
each
took
his
side
of
the
fire
we
had
always
slept
together
except
when
he
was
sick
and
the
night
i
had
left
him
alone
at
the
fort
some
time
in
the
night
i
became
thirsty
and
got
up
and
procured
some
snow
put
it
in
our
only
tin
cup
and
set
it
on
some
live
coals
to
melt
and
went
to
sleep
the
snow
melted
the
water
evaporated
the
solder
melted
and
left
the
tin
while
i
slept
my
dumb
friend
woke
up
thirsty
took
the
tin
cup
filled
it
with
snow
and
put
it
on
coals
the
snow
melted
and
the
water
run
out
on
the
coals
his
tongue
let
loose
and
he
then
denounced
me
as
a
knave
an
ass
a
fool
an
unregenerate
heathen
and
what
else
i
do
want
to
remember
i
woke
up
alarmed
and
did
not
at
first
fully
understand
what
had
created
the
storm
but
after
having
the
bottomless
cup
dashed
at
my
head
i
realized
the
situation
and
began
to
try
to
apologize
and
explain
the
unavoidable
and
unfortunate
circumstance
but
no
explanation
would
satisfy
his
now
thoroughly
johnny
bull
temper
after
this
little
nocturnal
disturbance
had
subsided
i
on
my
bed
of
fir
branches
with
my
feet
towards
the
fire
soon
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
and
knew
nothing
more
of
the
world
until
the
sun
was
shining
whether
or
not
my
friend
had
cooled
off
i
did
not
inquire
but
i
do
know
that
there
was
an
unusual
coldness
between
us
for
neither
spoke
to
the
other
until
about
twelve
and
then
as
will
appear
our
conversation
was
very
short
as
we
did
not
rise
until
late
no
delay
was
made
but
when
each
had
his
bag
on
his
back
and
a
nugget
of
jerk
in
his
hand
we
started
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
as
quiet
as
two
deaf
mutes
there
was
no
water
to
be
had
our
camp
kettle
had
been
left
at
the
fort
and
through
my
stupidity
the
cup
had
become
useless
therefore
we
were
obliged
to
eat
the
icy
snow
or
endure
the
thirst
no
new
snow
had
yet
fallen
in
this
high
altitude
although
it
was
now
nearing
the
end
of
october
these
mountains
were
then
heavily
covered
with
pine
and
fir
but
the
timber
was
not
large
in
some
places
where
the
snow
had
melted
away
short
green
grass
was
found
quite
close
to
great
banks
of
snow
at
about
twelve
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
great
uinta
range
and
i
being
a
little
in
advance
of
my
still
mute
companion
halted
to
take
a
survey
of
the
field
before
me
the
top
of
the
range
here
is
bare
of
timber
and
there
was
no
snow
when
field
came
up
i
broke
the
silence
which
had
lasted
since
the
little
unpleasantness
of
the
night
before
by
suggesting
that
we
attempt
to
cross
the
range
of
mountains
which
now
appeared
north
of
us
and
probably
fifty
miles
away
through
what
appeared
to
be
a
gap
or
low
place
in
the
great
range
of
mountains
he
replied
you
may
go
that
way
if
you
want
to
but
i
am
going
this
way
pointing
in
another
direction
and
quickly
started
off
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
to
the
right
or
directly
i
also
started
immediately
and
when
we
were
a
few
rods
apart
i
said
we
may
not
meet
again
very
soon
he
replied
and
within
a
few
minutes
we
were
out
of
sight
and
in
a
very
short
time
beyond
hailing
distance
this
was
the
last
i
saw
or
heard
of
him
until
after
each
of
us
had
undergone
many
more
hardships
so
i
will
now
drop
my
friend
but
will
hereafter
devote
a
chapter
to
him
and
give
you
an
account
of
his
experience
as
he
afterwards
gave
it
to
me
detailing
an
account
of
many
most
interesting
incidents
fortunately
we
had
divided
the
jerk
for
nothing
was
said
at
this
sudden
and
unexpected
parting
about
anything
which
either
had
in
his
possession
i
had
an
idea
when
i
bade
him
that
he
would
soon
turn
about
and
follow
me
after
the
unceremonious
parting
i
immediately
began
to
descend
the
north
side
of
the
mountain
which
was
very
rough
rocky
and
steep
but
down
down
down
i
went
into
a
deep
dark
cañon
where
i
slept
on
the
leaves
under
a
fir
tree
after
having
taken
some
landmarks
when
it
was
light
enough
to
see
the
objects
i
had
noted
to
guide
me
i
set
out
and
spent
the
day
in
crossing
over
hills
and
through
deep
cañons
in
the
evening
i
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
range
of
mountains
which
i
had
seen
from
the
point
of
our
parting
the
sun
disappeared
dark
clouds
began
to
float
over
the
mountains
and
it
was
evident
that
a
storm
was
approaching
while
it
was
yet
light
enough
i
took
some
landmarks
or
guiding
points
and
it
was
well
i
did
so
for
on
the
following
morning
when
i
woke
i
found
it
snowing
quietly
but
heavily
and
before
it
was
light
enough
for
me
to
see
my
guiding
objects
there
must
have
been
six
or
more
inches
of
new
snow
on
the
ground
beyond
my
snug
retreat
under
a
sheltering
pine
when
it
was
light
enough
i
rose
from
my
comfortable
bed
took
my
bearings
as
best
i
could
without
a
compass
and
started
up
the
mountain
through
the
rapidly
accumulating
bed
of
snow
the
snow
continued
to
fall
nearly
all
day
and
before
night
it
was
more
than
a
foot
deep
all
day
long
i
struggled
through
a
dense
forest
some
time
in
the
forenoon
i
crossed
the
fresh
trail
of
a
large
herd
of
elk
which
forcibly
reminded
me
that
my
sack
was
almost
empty
and
i
vainly
wished
that
one
of
these
wild
creatures
might
come
in
my
way
but
i
did
not
dare
to
follow
the
herd
with
the
uncertainty
of
killing
one
and
the
certainty
of
losing
my
way
this
dark
snowy
day
in
order
to
maintain
my
course
during
such
dark
days
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
looking
ahead
and
observing
trees
or
other
objects
in
my
line
of
travel
that
night
i
as
usual
slept
under
a
pine
tree
where
there
was
no
snow
i
saw
no
sign
of
fire
in
either
of
these
ranges
of
mountains
nor
did
i
see
any
signs
of
indians
on
my
trip
over
these
two
ranges
the
next
day
as
i
approached
the
top
of
the
mountain
i
found
the
timber
much
smaller
and
mostly
pine
there
is
much
fertile
land
in
some
of
the
valleys
between
the
two
great
ranges
of
mountains
early
on
the
following
morning
i
arrived
at
the
bald
summit
on
my
right
and
on
my
left
were
high
untimbered
peaks
from
this
point
i
could
overlook
a
vast
territory
extending
over
many
hills
valleys
and
smaller
mountains
where
there
was
no
snow
in
fact
the
snow
only
extended
a
few
miles
down
the
steep
sides
of
the
great
range
as
a
rule
there
is
more
timber
on
the
north
than
on
the
south
side
of
mountains
west
of
the
rockies
but
it
was
the
reverse
here
for
there
was
little
timber
on
the
north
side
of
this
range
one
more
day
tramping
brought
me
down
into
a
large
barren
plain
where
i
gathered
some
dry
weeds
for
a
bed
and
slept
without
food
or
water
the
last
bit
of
the
mule
or
wolf
i
know
not
which
i
had
eaten
during
the
afternoon
i
had
had
very
little
jerk
for
the
last
two
or
three
days
and
began
to
wish
that
i
had
another
horse
mule
or
even
a
wolf
for
many
days
i
had
seen
no
living
thing
except
when
i
looked
into
a
small
glass
which
i
carried
in
my
pocket
and
then
only
saw
a
familiar
shadow
i
spent
another
day
without
food
but
had
plenty
of
water
another
night
on
a
bed
of
green
brush
beside
a
good
fire
the
next
day
was
bright
and
sunny
quite
a
contrast
to
the
gloomy
days
i
had
spent
in
the
mountains
for
want
of
food
i
was
becoming
quite
weak
and
was
not
able
to
travel
as
fast
as
usual
during
the
early
part
of
the
day
i
saw
some
tracks
of
an
unshod
horse
which
renewed
my
courage
and
hope
of
redemption
and
at
about
two
in
the
afternoon
i
saw
some
dark
spots
on
the
plain
a
long
distance
away
but
almost
in
the
direction
i
was
going
hoping
that
these
objects
might
be
living
creatures
i
hurried
on
for
a
time
then
sat
down
and
after
having
watched
them
for
a
time
i
found
that
they
changed
positions
and
that
satisfied
me
to
a
moral
certainty
that
they
were
living
creatures
but
what
i
could
not
tell
they
might
be
horses
cattle
elk
deer
antelope
or
buffalo
but
no
matter
what
i
must
hurry
on
and
try
to
reach
them
before
night
late
in
the
evening
i
determined
that
they
were
horses
but
could
not
yet
tell
whether
they
belonged
to
whites
or
indians
or
were
wild
as
i
approached
them
they
stopped
grazing
and
started
toward
me
but
soon
disappeared
in
a
deep
gulch
between
us
which
i
had
not
noticed
before
on
arriving
at
the
edge
of
the
gulch
or
narrow
valley
i
saw
the
horses
in
the
vicinity
of
about
fifteen
or
twenty
wigwams
which
were
all
in
a
row
on
the
bank
of
a
little
creek
that
ran
through
the
gulch
many
indians
were
sitting
outside
of
their
lodges
the
weather
being
warm
on
first
sight
of
the
village
being
not
more
than
yards
away
my
heart
fluttered
just
a
little
not
knowing
whether
the
savages
would
scalp
me
or
not
but
notwithstanding
my
natural
cowardice
i
at
once
determined
to
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
and
walked
as
boldly
as
i
could
up
to
the
lower
end
of
the
row
of
wigwams
within
a
few
feet
of
the
nearest
one
three
young
bucks
met
me
and
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
know
whence
i
came
and
whither
i
was
going
whether
right
down
from
heaven
and
if
so
what
was
my
mission
they
seemed
as
much
surprised
at
my
sudden
appearance
as
i
was
on
coming
so
suddenly
upon
them
my
first
and
most
important
business
was
to
determine
whether
they
would
give
me
something
to
eat
or
eat
me
as
the
men
women
and
children
began
to
gather
around
me
i
heard
some
one
half
way
up
the
line
of
lodges
call
out
saying
something
which
i
did
not
understand
but
on
looking
that
way
saw
a
man
beckoning
to
me
as
i
thought
when
the
young
men
motioned
for
me
to
move
on
up
the
line
on
arriving
at
the
place
indicated
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
one
whom
i
then
suspected
and
afterwards
found
to
be
the
chief
who
extended
to
his
royal
right
hand
and
greeted
me
in
a
most
courteous
and
polite
manner
and
then
with
a
graceful
wave
of
his
hand
and
a
slight
bow
indicated
that
i
should
precede
him
at
the
low
open
door
into
his
royal
palace
where
he
very
politely
introduced
me
to
his
wife
who
proved
to
be
a
sensible
clever
courteous
woman
she
soon
prepared
some
thing
for
me
to
eat
and
after
i
had
finished
my
supper
an
indian
brought
in
two
pistols
and
wanted
me
to
take
the
cap
tube
from
one
and
put
it
into
the
other
which
i
soon
accomplished
he
was
much
pleased
went
out
and
soon
returned
with
ten
or
more
pounds
of
elk
meat
which
he
tendered
to
me
as
compensation
for
my
work
but
the
chief
objected
and
insisted
as
i
understood
him
that
he
had
plenty
and
that
i
was
his
guest
but
finally
consented
for
me
to
accept
part
of
the
meat
i
gave
him
to
understand
that
i
wanted
to
go
to
fort
bridger
a
case
of
nice
new
blankets
was
opened
as
it
appeared
to
me
for
my
especial
benefit
the
chief
his
lady
two
sons
almost
grown
two
or
three
wolfish
looking
dogs
which
forcibly
reminded
me
of
terrible
scare
and
myself
made
up
the
number
of
lodgers
in
that
mansion
that
night
late
that
night
some
warriors
who
had
been
out
on
a
campaign
came
home
and
learning
that
there
was
a
stranger
within
the
gates
came
to
the
king
palace
to
see
him
and
also
to
report
that
they
had
discovered
some
white
barbarians
in
the
vicinity
who
had
dared
to
enter
his
domain
without
a
special
permit
and
that
they
had
sent
a
message
to
his
highness
informing
him
that
they
had
a
good
assortment
of
blankets
cutlery
pins
needles
beads
which
his
people
might
need
or
desire
and
also
a
limited
amount
of
and
that
they
would
be
pleased
to
receive
his
order
for
anything
he
might
desire
the
fact
of
the
presence
of
these
in
the
vicinity
was
at
once
communicated
to
me
and
early
on
the
following
morning
i
was
informed
that
if
it
was
my
desire
to
cut
short
my
stay
at
the
palace
the
king
would
take
great
pleasure
in
furnishing
me
means
of
conveyance
a
proper
escort
and
a
reliable
guide
who
would
safely
conduct
me
to
the
camp
of
the
accommodating
merchants
or
indian
traders
but
in
fact
indian
robbers
notwithstanding
my
reluctance
in
leaving
the
society
of
the
noble
ruler
and
his
people
i
most
readily
accepted
his
generous
offer
and
after
breakfast
which
consisted
of
elk
meat
and
tobacco
root
in
a
combination
stew
which
was
very
palatable
a
fine
steed
with
a
good
mexican
saddle
and
bridle
was
at
the
door
my
escort
consisting
of
four
mounted
warriors
was
ready
and
after
bidding
my
good
friends
farewell
i
with
some
assistance
mounted
my
charger
and
we
were
all
off
on
a
full
run
up
and
down
hill
and
across
valley
at
what
seemed
to
me
a
fearful
rate
in
less
than
two
hours
we
entered
the
camp
of
the
traders
at
full
speed
dismounted
and
found
one
man
a
long
jake
from
illinois
who
could
speak
english
he
had
two
wives
squaws
and
several
children
which
he
claimed
but
some
of
them
were
quite
dark
his
name
was
john
smith
not
a
very
uncommon
one
he
was
a
very
clever
man
about
years
old
was
not
a
mormon
but
had
taken
the
women
in
order
to
become
popular
with
the
indians
and
to
improve
his
opportunities
for
trade
after
getting
something
to
eat
and
learning
something
through
smith
of
my
adventures
my
escort
made
ready
to
return
to
their
camp
their
trip
as
smith
told
me
was
made
solely
for
my
accommodation
and
now
i
had
nothing
with
which
to
compensate
them
but
as
they
were
about
to
leave
i
took
a
large
bandanna
the
only
one
i
had
left
and
tied
it
around
the
neck
of
the
chief
son
he
being
one
of
the
clever
escorts
he
at
first
refused
to
accept
it
but
when
smith
told
him
that
i
desired
him
to
take
it
as
a
token
of
regard
he
accepted
it
with
an
expression
of
thanks
and
after
i
had
bidden
them
all
they
rode
away
as
rapidly
as
we
had
come
i
will
always
hold
that
chief
and
his
people
in
kindly
remembrance
all
of
the
other
white
men
with
smith
were
french
and
all
had
plenty
of
wives
squaws
and
numerous
slaves
the
wives
were
not
slaves
but
they
had
slaves
all
around
them
the
whole
tribe
traveled
about
and
lived
much
as
other
tribes
did
only
much
better
for
they
lived
by
trading
while
the
others
lived
by
hunting
and
fishing
in
this
camp
i
ate
bread
for
the
first
time
in
many
weeks
at
the
end
of
three
days
after
my
arrival
here
a
caravan
was
ready
to
start
for
fort
bridger
for
winter
supplies
for
the
traders
i
was
furnished
with
a
good
horse
and
saddle
and
smith
one
of
the
frenchmen
five
slaves
horses
and
myself
made
up
the
caravan
and
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
we
reached
the
fort
where
i
was
very
kindly
received
smith
was
a
large
man
had
a
good
head
and
some
cultivation
and
apparent
refinement
and
treated
his
women
and
children
well
he
said
he
had
been
to
his
old
home
in
illinois
since
he
had
entered
upon
this
kind
of
life
but
was
not
contented
there
and
soon
returned
to
his
indian
friends
he
and
those
frenchmen
were
as
generous
and
hospitable
as
old
southern
planters
and
their
kindness
to
me
will
not
be
forgotten
while
my
memory
lasts
i
was
well
treated
at
the
fort
which
is
miles
from
the
point
where
the
seven
dug
up
the
little
from
its
sandy
bed
on
the
fifth
day
of
august
just
three
mouths
before
since
which
i
had
undergone
many
hardships
took
many
fearful
risks
and
traveled
more
than
a
thousand
miles
far
enough
to
have
taken
me
from
green
river
to
san
francisco
on
the
morning
of
the
seventh
day
of
november
i
started
with
a
government
train
for
salt
lake
city
where
i
arrived
on
the
fifteenth
i
soon
found
a
home
with
a
prominent
mormon
a
scotchman
named
archie
gardner
living
in
the
fifth
ward
on
mill
creek
one
of
the
many
small
streams
coming
down
from
the
mountains
east
of
the
city
gardner
was
a
clever
gentleman
about
years
old
had
a
up
in
the
mountains
and
was
then
building
a
flour
mill
only
a
few
rods
from
his
dwelling
i
assisted
him
in
completing
the
little
flour
mill
and
in
attending
it
during
the
winter
gardner
had
three
wives
all
living
in
one
house
but
occupying
separate
rooms
at
night
i
usually
attended
the
little
mill
until
midnight
and
gardner
made
it
part
of
my
duty
to
go
to
his
house
and
call
him
he
usually
told
me
where
i
could
find
him
but
not
always
so
at
times
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
rapping
at
more
than
one
door
before
i
found
him
he
had
the
largest
house
in
the
ward
and
the
religious
services
were
held
there
by
bishop
johnson
who
also
acted
as
justice
of
the
peace
in
that
ward
gardner
family
all
ate
at
the
same
table
over
which
the
first
wife
presided
she
was
indeed
mistress
of
the
house
the
other
wives
treating
her
with
great
respect
and
all
were
to
all
outward
appearance
quite
friendly
gardner
bestowed
much
attention
on
his
first
wife
though
i
always
suspected
that
he
was
just
a
little
more
fond
of
the
youngest
one
and
i
did
not
blame
him
much
for
she
manifested
strong
affection
for
him
even
in
the
presence
of
the
others
and
yet
there
was
no
outward
manifestation
of
jealousy
the
second
or
the
one
i
will
call
the
second
because
she
was
in
age
between
the
others
and
was
the
mother
of
the
third
or
youngest
a
widowed
mother
and
her
daughter
having
been
sealed
to
gardner
at
the
same
time
the
first
wife
having
given
her
consent
and
standing
with
them
at
the
triple
matrimonial
altar
and
then
and
there
joining
in
the
sacred
ceremony
as
i
was
about
to
say
the
second
wife
seemed
to
be
pleased
at
the
manifestation
of
affection
for
the
common
husband
by
the
youngest
wife
and
no
would
in
a
way
say
my
annie
do
be
so
demonstrative
in
the
presence
of
other
people
when
the
husband
would
laugh
and
go
and
kiss
no
gardner
spent
most
of
his
leisure
time
particularly
during
the
day
and
evening
in
his
first
wife
apartments
with
her
and
her
children
he
was
a
very
religious
man
and
always
had
family
prayers
before
retiring
at
night
and
all
persons
about
the
house
were
expected
to
join
at
least
formally
in
this
service
the
use
of
profane
language
was
not
allowed
in
or
about
the
house
many
of
the
higher
church
officers
were
entertained
at
gardner
house
and
table
among
whom
were
brigham
young
george
smith
heber
kimble
george
taylor
and
parley
pratt
with
all
of
whom
i
formed
some
acquaintance
brigham
was
a
dignified
clever
gentleman
not
austere
but
kind
and
affable
kimble
was
also
a
nice
genteel
genial
redheaded
gentleman
smith
was
a
heavy
man
with
a
very
large
abdomen
dark
hair
full
beard
exceedingly
jovial
and
apparently
always
happy
pratt
was
a
small
rather
slim
quick
and
athletic
man
rather
austere
refined
active
and
energetic
taylor
was
a
large
man
highly
intellectual
and
rather
unsocial
kimble
was
my
favorite
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
had
fifteen
wives
mostly
young
and
handsome
all
in
one
house
and
my
impression
is
that
none
of
them
had
any
children
i
think
it
was
conceded
that
his
was
the
finest
harem
in
utah
he
called
me
his
young
gentile
was
very
kind
and
affable
but
he
never
invited
me
to
inspect
his
harem
about
the
first
of
december
field
arrived
in
salt
lake
city
and
i
will
allude
to
a
little
matter
in
which
he
was
concerned
after
which
i
will
give
you
a
short
account
of
his
trip
from
the
time
we
parted
company
until
he
arrived
in
salt
lake
as
he
afterwards
gave
it
to
me
soon
after
he
arrived
in
the
city
of
the
saints
he
heard
of
another
who
had
recently
arrived
from
the
south
and
that
he
was
located
in
the
fifth
ward
on
mill
creek
at
the
house
of
one
gardner
and
at
which
house
he
soon
arrived
after
staying
with
me
for
two
or
three
days
he
found
employment
in
the
family
of
the
apostle
john
taylor
the
family
consisted
of
seven
wives
living
in
seven
different
houses
how
many
children
there
were
i
never
knew
but
there
was
one
wife
who
did
not
have
any
she
was
a
fine
specimen
of
english
beauty
taylor
women
were
nearly
all
english
it
was
the
business
of
my
friend
to
cut
wood
and
do
chores
generally
for
the
taylor
family
living
in
seven
different
places
at
the
same
time
taylor
was
in
europe
that
winter
looking
after
the
interest
of
the
church
and
possibly
after
a
few
more
wives
and
consequently
could
not
in
person
attend
to
all
of
the
necessities
of
the
seven
branches
of
his
family
in
his
daily
rounds
looking
after
the
seven
and
other
little
matters
appertaining
to
the
comfort
of
the
family
in
so
many
places
field
happened
to
come
in
contact
with
the
english
beauty
and
the
result
was
mutual
love
at
first
sight
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
woman
had
passed
and
taken
all
of
the
solemn
vows
of
the
lym
house
with
the
apostle
and
his
six
other
wives
i
do
not
think
that
my
english
friend
had
lost
one
iota
of
the
fond
recollection
of
his
long
since
dead
english
wife
the
picture
of
whom
he
still
carried
near
his
heart
but
nevertheless
he
and
this
seventh
wife
of
the
noted
apostle
fell
heels
over
head
in
love
field
as
you
know
was
a
well
developed
intelligent
man
of
forty
the
woman
was
well
developed
and
as
smart
as
a
and
both
being
english
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
their
mutual
admiration
and
infatuation
nor
did
i
blame
them
much
i
was
entrusted
with
many
envelopes
which
i
carried
from
one
to
the
other
with
my
feeble
assistance
they
tried
to
devise
some
method
by
which
they
might
escape
from
the
city
before
the
apostle
should
return
home
but
the
danites
were
always
on
the
alert
and
they
well
knew
that
detection
by
the
danites
of
an
attempt
to
get
away
together
would
lead
to
certain
death
to
him
and
if
not
to
her
she
would
certainly
have
been
returned
to
her
polygamous
state
of
bondage
spring
came
with
little
hope
of
escape
and
they
reluctantly
parted
with
the
mutual
understanding
that
if
possible
she
would
make
her
escape
and
go
to
sacramento
where
he
promised
to
keep
his
address
ten
months
after
the
parting
they
had
not
met
yet
and
if
they
ever
did
it
was
after
i
had
lost
all
further
knowledge
of
him
mormon
morals
exclusive
of
polygamy
are
very
good
i
never
saw
a
drunken
man
in
salt
lake
city
and
heard
very
little
profane
language
there
the
people
were
industrious
and
seemed
happy
their
hospitality
rivaled
that
of
the
old
southern
planters
and
their
charity
was
equal
to
that
of
other
christians
i
will
now
go
back
to
the
place
where
field
and
i
separated
on
the
mountain
top
and
give
you
a
short
statement
as
he
gave
it
to
me
and
while
some
things
may
border
on
the
miraculous
and
seem
somewhat
incredible
i
do
not
question
the
truth
of
his
statements
when
we
parted
so
unexpectedly
he
had
about
half
of
the
jerked
wolf
and
mule
combined
i
went
north
while
he
bore
off
in
a
northeasterly
direction
and
after
traveling
for
three
days
came
to
the
river
at
a
point
above
where
we
lost
our
he
struggled
on
up
the
river
without
road
or
trail
and
nothing
to
guide
him
except
the
little
compass
which
he
still
carried
in
his
pocket
two
days
more
and
his
last
bit
of
jerk
was
gone
starvation
began
to
stare
him
in
the
face
once
more
he
saw
signs
of
indians
having
crossed
his
pathless
course
which
gave
him
renewed
courage
soon
after
starting
out
next
morning
he
was
delighted
to
see
a
pony
in
the
distance
grazing
and
on
coming
up
to
it
found
one
of
its
front
legs
broken
this
he
said
was
another
the
poor
pony
seemed
to
fear
him
it
was
probably
an
indian
pony
had
its
leg
broken
and
was
left
to
die
he
followed
it
for
some
time
and
finally
got
close
to
it
and
fired
his
revolver
at
its
chest
and
wounded
it
but
it
then
left
him
with
the
blood
flowing
from
its
wound
after
resting
for
a
time
he
followed
on
and
soon
found
it
lying
down
but
not
dead
he
told
me
how
innocent
and
helpless
it
appeared
and
looked
at
him
as
if
pleading
with
him
not
to
inflict
any
more
pain
but
he
felt
that
his
life
was
in
a
balance
with
its
and
after
a
little
meditation
he
put
the
revolver
to
its
forehead
and
ended
its
life
and
suffering
then
came
the
usual
process
of
skinning
cutting
up
and
jerking
which
took
the
balance
of
that
day
and
part
of
the
next
eight
days
more
and
he
was
again
starving
on
the
ninth
he
arrived
at
the
spot
where
we
had
dug
up
the
little
which
carried
the
seven
adventurers
far
down
the
river
more
than
three
very
long
dreary
months
before
snow
now
covered
the
entire
country
and
all
emigrants
had
long
since
gone
by
his
strength
was
failing
fast
but
it
would
not
do
to
linger
there
so
he
arose
and
was
about
to
start
when
he
saw
a
poor
old
ox
slowly
coming
towards
him
and
when
it
had
come
up
near
to
him
he
discovered
a
wolf
not
far
behind
which
seemed
to
be
following
the
ox
but
it
soon
turned
and
went
away
night
was
coming
on
and
he
was
very
hungry
something
must
be
done
the
last
cartridge
had
been
exploded
in
killing
the
poor
broken
legged
indian
pony
and
the
revolver
was
no
longer
of
use
the
ox
though
feeble
was
probably
yet
stronger
than
the
starving
man
field
feared
that
he
was
not
able
to
catch
the
ox
by
the
horns
and
hold
it
until
he
could
cut
its
throat
so
the
next
plan
was
to
get
hold
of
the
animal
tail
with
one
hand
and
with
the
big
knife
in
the
other
cut
his
hamstrings
so
as
to
disable
him
and
then
cut
his
throat
the
ox
seemed
fond
of
being
rubbed
and
petted
so
after
a
little
time
a
firm
hold
on
the
tail
was
secured
and
the
big
knife
vigorously
applied
but
it
was
so
very
dull
that
he
could
not
sever
the
tough
old
tendons
after
sawing
with
the
dull
knife
and
being
literally
dragged
for
some
distance
he
became
so
much
exhausted
that
he
was
obliged
to
relinquish
his
hold
and
see
the
excited
old
ox
disappear
in
almost
complete
despair
field
spent
the
night
beside
a
fire
under
one
of
those
large
cottonwoods
which
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
remember
even
though
it
is
now
more
than
forty
years
since
you
saw
them
he
rose
early
next
morning
and
started
out
on
the
well
beaten
road
towards
the
golden
west
but
had
only
gone
a
few
hundred
yards
when
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
again
behold
the
old
ox
approaching
him
but
so
much
exhausted
that
it
could
scarcely
walk
the
same
or
some
other
wolf
was
near
by
and
had
probably
followed
the
poor
old
ox
all
night
when
the
ox
came
close
to
field
the
wolf
growled
and
again
turned
away
as
on
the
evening
before
after
the
wolf
had
left
the
ox
seemed
to
be
relieved
it
then
occurred
to
the
starving
emigrant
that
he
had
a
sharp
razor
in
his
kitt
with
which
he
knew
he
could
cut
those
tough
tendons
provided
he
could
get
another
hold
on
that
tail
field
as
you
probably
remember
always
kept
his
face
cleanly
shaved
even
while
we
were
starving
he
would
shave
almost
every
day
the
ox
was
tired
and
worn
out
and
so
was
field
but
he
got
the
razor
ready
and
soon
had
hold
of
that
tail
again
off
went
the
ox
the
keen
razor
was
applied
soon
the
tendons
parted
and
down
went
the
ox
but
only
half
the
victory
was
won
for
the
ox
would
raise
up
on
his
front
feet
and
show
fight
but
after
resting
awhile
the
victor
rushed
up
caught
the
poor
beast
by
the
horns
pushed
him
over
on
his
side
held
him
down
and
cut
his
throat
after
a
long
much
needed
rest
he
cut
out
a
piece
of
the
poor
beef
broiled
and
ate
it
and
then
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
hunting
out
the
small
lean
muscles
that
still
remained
between
the

put
into
the
sack

on
the
following
morning
was
thrown
upon
the

he
fed

the
next
six
days

chapter
xiii
story
of
the
jayhawkers
in
the
foregoing
chapters
describing
the
trip
across
the
deserts
and
mountains
the
author
has
had
occasion
many
times
to
refer
to
the
jayhawkers
their
history
is
in
many
respects
no
less
remarkable
and
intensely
interesting
than
that
of
his
own
party
the
author
has
therefore
collected
many
notes
and
interviews
with
prominent
members
and
presents
herewith
the
only
written
history
of
their
travels
the
little
train
afterward
known
by
this
name
was
made
up
in
the
state
of
illinois
in
of
industrious
enterprising
young
men
who
were
eager
to
see
and
explore
the
new
country
then
promising
gold
to
those
who
sought
the
young
men
were
from
knoxville
galesburg
and
other
towns
not
all
were
influenced
by
the
desire
for
gold
it
was
said
that
california
had
a
milder
climate
and
that
pleasant
homes
could
there
be
made
and
the
long
cold
winter
avoided
they
placed
some
of
the
best
men
in
position
to
manage
for
the
whole
the
outfit
was
placed
on
a
and
transported
to
kanesville
on
the
missouri
river
above
council
bluffs
some
of
the
company
went
with
the
goods
while
others
bought
teams
and
wagons
in
western
missouri
and
drove
to
the
appointed
place
kanesville
was
a
small
mormon
camp
while
council
bluffs
was
a
trading
post
of
a
few
log
cabins
on
the
river
bank
inhabited
mostly
by
indians
there
was
no
regular
ferry
at
either
place
and
our
party
secured
a
log
raft
which
they
used
to
get
their
wagons
and
provisions
across
making
the
oxen
swim
they
asked
all
the
questions
they
could
think
of
from
everyone
who
pretended
to
know
anything
about
the
great
country
to
the
west
of
them
for
it
seemed
a
great
undertaking
to
set
out
into
the
land
they
could
see
stretching
out
before
them
across
the
river
other
parties
bound
the
same
way
also
arrived
and
joined
them
they
chose
a
guide
who
claimed
to
have
been
over
the
road
before
when
all
were
gathered
together
the
guide
told
them
that
they
were
about
to
enter
an
indian
country
and
that
the
dusky
residents
did
not
always
fancy
the
idea
of
strangers
richer
than
themselves
passing
through
and
sometimes
showed
out
some
of
the
bad
traits
the
indians
had
been
said
to
possess
it
would
therefore
be
better
to
organize
and
travel
systematically
he
would
divide
the
company
into
divisions
and
have
each
division
choose
a
captain
and
the
whole
company
unite
in
adopting
some
rules
and
laws
which
they
would
all
agree
to
observe
this
arrangement
was
satisfactorily
accomplished
and
they
moved
out
in
a
sort
of
military
style
and
then
they
launched
out
on
the
almost
endless
western
prairie
said
then
to
be
a
thousand
miles
wide
containing
few
trees
and
generally
unknown
these
illinois
boys
were
young
and
full
of
mirth
and
fun
which
was
continually
overflowing
they
seemed
to
think
they
were
to
be
on
a
sort
of
every
day
picnic
and
bound
to
make
life
as
merry
and
happy
as
it
could
be
one
of
the
boys
was
ed
doty
who
was
a
sort
of
model
traveler
in
this
line
a
camp
life
suited
him
he
could
drive
an
ox
team
cook
a
meal
of
victuals
turn
a
pan
of
with
a
flop
and
possessed
many
other
frontier
accomplishments
one
day
when
doty
was
engaged
in
the
duty
of
cooking
another
frolicsome
fellow
came
up
and
took
off
the
cook
hat
and
commenced
going
through
the
motions
of
a
barber
giving
his
customer
a
vigorous
shampoo
saying
am
going
to
make
a
jayhawker
out
of
you
old
now
it
happened
at
the
election
for
captain
in
this
division
that
ed
doty
was
chosen
captain
and
no
sooner
was
the
choice
declared
than
the
boys
took
the
newly
elected
captain
on
their
shoulders
and
carried
him
around
the
camp
introducing
him
as
the
bird
of
the
so
their
division
was
afterwards
known
as
the
jayhawkers
but
whether
the
word
originated
with
them
and
john
brown
forgot
to
give
them
credit
or
whether
it
was
some
old
frontier
word
used
in
sport
on
the
occasion
is
more
than
i
will
undertake
to
say
however
the
boys
felt
proud
of
their
title
and
the
organization
has
been
kept
up
to
this
day
by
the
survivors
as
will
be
related
further
on
the
first
few
days
they
got
along
finely
and
began
to
lose
all
feeling
of
danger
and
to
become
rather
careless
in
their
guard
duty
when
the
cattle
had
eaten
enough
and
lain
down
the
guards
would
sometimes
come
into
camp
and
go
to
sleep
always
finding
the
stock
all
right
in
the
morning
and
no
enemy
or
suspicious
persons
in
sight
but
one
bright
morning
no
cattle
were
in
sight
which
was
rather
strange
as
the
country
was
all
prairie
they
went
out
to
look
making
a
big
circuit
and
found
no
traces
till
they
came
to
the
river
when
they
found
tracks
upon
the
bank
and
saw
some
camps
across
the
river
a
mile
or
so
away
doty
had
a
small
spy
glass
and
by
rigging
up
a
tripod
of
small
sticks
to
hold
it
steady
they
scanned
the
camps
pretty
closely
and
decided
that
there
were
too
many
oxen
for
the
wagons
in
sight
some
of
the
smartest
of
them
stripped
off
their
clothes
and
started
to
swim
the
stream
but
landed
on
the
same
side
they
started
from
captain
doty
studied
the
matter
a
little
and
then
set
out
himself
being
a
good
swimmer
and
by
a
little
shrewd
management
and
swimming
up
stream
when
the
current
was
strongest
soon
got
across
to
where
he
could
touch
bottom
and
shouted
to
the
others
to
do
the
same
soon
all
the
swimmers
were
across
they
could
now
see
that
there
were
two
trains
on
that
side
and
that
the
farther
one
had
already
begun
to
move
and
was
about
a
mile
in
advance
of
the
nearest
one
doty
said
something
must
be
done
and
although
they
only
were
clothed
in
undershirts
they
approached
the
nearest
camp
and
were
handed
some
overalls
for
temporary
use
the
men
in
this
camp
on
hearing
about
the
missing
oxen
said
the
fellows
in
the
forward
train
went
over
and
got
them
for
as
they
said
there
were
no
wagons
in
sight
and
they
must
be
strays
he
said
the
forward
train
was
from
tennessee
and
that
they
had
some
occasion
to
doubt
their
honesty
and
had
refused
to
travel
with
them
any
further
they
said
they
were
all
old
missourians
and
did
not
want
other
people
property
and
if
the
boys
found
their
cattle
with
the
tenneseans
and
wanted
any
help
to
get
them
back
again
to
call
on
them
and
putting
in
some
good
strong
swear
words
for
emphasis
the
boys
barefooted
and
with
only
overalls
and
shirts
started
after
the
moving
train
which
they
called
to
a
halt
when
overtaken
the
coarse
grass
was
pretty
hard
to
hurry
through
clothed
as
they
were
the
train
men
were
pretty
gruff
and
wanted
to
know
what
was
wanted
capt
doty
very
emphatically
told
them
he
could
see
some
of
his
oxen
in
their
train
and
others
in
the
herd
and
he
proposed
to
have
them
all
back
again
the
jayhawker
boys
were
unarmed
but
were
in
a
fighting
mood
and
determined
to
have
the
stock
at
all
hazards
and
if
not
peaceably
war
might
commence
the
boys
saw
that
the
two
trains
were
of
about
equal
strength
and
if
worse
came
to
worst
they
could
go
back
and
get
their
guns
and
men
and
come
over
in
full
force
after
their
property
and
they
were
assured
the
missourians
would
help
them
and
a
combination
of
forces
would
give
them
a
majority
and
they
could
not
be
beaten
by
the
tennessee
crowd
there
was
a
good
deal
of
talk
but
finally
when
doty
demanded
that
their
cattle
be
unyoked
and
the
others
separated
from
the
herd
they
yielded
and
gave
them
all
their
stock
some
seventy
head
the
missourians
had
come
up
and
heard
the
talk
and
some
of
them
went
back
and
helped
drive
the
cattle
to
the
river
and
deal
out
some
double
shotted
thunder
against
the
biggest
scamps
they
had
come
across
it
was
quite
a
job
to
get
the
cattle
across
the
river
they
would
go
in
a
little
way
and
then
circle
round
and
round
like
a
circus
making
no
progress
they
finally
put
a
rope
on
one
of
them
and
a
man
led
him
as
far
as
he
could
which
was
more
than
half
way
and
although
they
landed
a
good
ways
down
stream
they
got
them
all
across
safely
left
their
borrowed
overalls
in
the
hands
of
their
friends
with
a
thousand
thanks
for
valuable
assistance
and
plunged
into
the
swift
running
platte
and
swam
back
again
to
the
northern
side
they
drove
the
straggling
oxen
back
to
camp
with
a
sense
of
great
satisfaction
and
in
turn
received
the
praise
of
their
friends
who
said
that
ed
doty
was
the
best
jayhawker
of
the
border
this
was
the
first
unpleasantness
and
they
were
afterwards
more
cautious
and
stood
guard
all
night
watching
closely
all
the
time
both
night
and
day
for
for
any
signs
of
danger
thus
in
time
they
reached
salt
lake
rather
late
in
the
season
but
safe
and
sound
having
escaped
cholera
or
other
disease
and
in
good
spirits
to
surmount
any
further
difficulties
which
might
be
met
when
the
jayhawkers
reached
salt
lake
it
was
found
that
it
was
not
safe
to
try
to
go
the
regular
northern
route
to
california
as
they
were
advised
by
those
who
seemed
to
know
as
they
might
be
snowed
in
on
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
and
perish
the
mormons
told
them
that
the
snow
often
fell
there
twenty
feet
deep
and
some
other
stories
likely
to
deter
them
from
making
the
attempt
they
also
told
them
of
a
route
farther
south
by
which
they
could
come
into
california
at
los
angeles
or
they
could
remain
in
salt
lake
until
may
when
it
would
be
safe
to
try
the
mountain
route
again
after
listening
to
the
talk
of
the
mountaineers
who
claimed
to
have
been
over
the
route
and
to
know
all
about
it
and
camping
some
time
to
rest
and
learn
all
they
could
they
finally
decided
on
taking
the
southern
route
one
mormon
told
them
of
a
place
where
they
could
make
a
and
save
five
hundred
miles
and
if
they
would
follow
his
instructions
they
would
find
the
route
fully
as
good
as
the
one
usually
traveled
which
was
not
much
better
than
a
trail
the
was
so
instilled
into
their
minds
that
they
had
great
confidence
in
the
report
and
talked
very
favorably
of
taking
it
the
man
williams
made
for
them
a
map
of
the
proposed
route
and
explained
it
to
them
and
others
who
had
gathered
at
salt
lake
and
from
the
map
they
could
see
how
much
was
to
be
gained
in
time
and
distance
by
taking
that
route
a
month
or
two
of
travel
was
indeed
something
to
gain
and
as
the
roads
seemed
similar
in
quality
the
reasoning
was
very
plausible
the
map
explained
all
the
watering
places
and
favorable
things
but
said
nothing
about
a
desert
and
as
there
was
no
one
to
tell
them
any
unfavorable
side
to
this
plan
there
were
many
who
quite
concluded
to
go
this
way
and
among
those
who
did
so
were
the
jayhawkers
and
the
williams
short
route
was
freely
talked
about
as
a
settled
thing
by
them
they
now
set
about
preparing
to
move
they
sold
traded
and
bought
oxen
till
they
had
the
best
and
fattest
teams
in
salt
lake
valley
selected
good
provisions
and
plenty
of
them
so
as
to
be
safe
in
case
of
delay
and
contended
that
nothing
could
stop
them
in
a
country
where
but
little
snow
could
be
and
water
was
as
plentiful
as
shown
on
the
map
they
wanted
to
reach
the
gold
mines
and
this
was
the
shortest
route
and
even
if
it
was
still
considerably
longer
than
the
northern
way
they
said
they
would
rather
be
moving
along
and
thus
gain
time
than
to
so
long
in
camp
with
nothing
to
do
by
which
they
could
earn
a
cent
there
were
here
in
salt
lake
ten
times
as
many
men
as
could
find
employment
and
saints
would
be
pretty
sure
to
get
all
of
the
odd
jobs
to
the
exclusion
of
the
heretics
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
determination
a
paper
was
drawn
up
for
those
to
sign
who
wanted
to
go
the
southern
route
and
it
was
pretty
generally
signed
the
mormon
elder
john
hunt
was
consulted
and
as
he
seemed
to
know
the
general
southern
route
better
than
any
one
else
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
guide
the
train
through
on
the
old
spanish
trail
this
had
never
been
used
as
a
wagon
road
but
he
thought
it
could
be
without
much
difficulty
and
he
said
if
they
could
secure
him
a
fair
sized
train
he
would
go
and
conduct
them
through
for
ten
dollars
a
wagon
this
proposition
was
accepted
after
some
consideration
and
all
who
wished
to
do
so
were
given
permission
to
join
the
train
in
a
few
days
there
were
one
hundred
and
seven
wagons
enlisted
for
this
route
including
seven
mormons
bound
for
san
bernardino
preparations
for
the
trip
now
began
in
good
earnest
and
the
saints
were
liberally
patronized
in
purchase
of
flour
and
meat
which
were
the
principal
things
they
had
to
sell
as
their
several
wagons
were
loaded
they
moved
out
in
small
lots
to
the
south
to
keep
in
good
fresh
feed
for
their
animals
and
to
move
on
slowly
till
all
were
ready
when
they
would
join
in
one
large
body
and
proceed
the
guide
was
in
no
special
haste
as
he
said
he
wanted
to
wait
a
little
later
so
the
weather
in
the
south
would
be
cooler
than
they
would
be
likely
to
find
it
if
they
pressed
on
at
once
he
said
that
in
summer
it
was
so
hot
that
no
white
man
could
endure
the
heat
he
said
they
could
work
slowly
along
the
trail
and
when
the
right
time
came
he
would
move
out
himself
and
that
they
might
be
assured
that
it
would
then
be
the
coolest
and
best
time
in
which
to
travel
down
there
so
the
company
dallied
along
and
it
was
october
before
the
whole
train
was
made
up
at
a
point
about
a
hundred
miles
south
of
salt
lake
the
complete
organization
was
divided
into
seven
divisions
each
with
its
captain
and
division
no
was
to
lead
the
march
the
first
day
and
then
fall
to
the
rear
while
no
took
the
advance
and
so
continued
till
all
had
taken
their
turn
the
leading
party
was
to
guard
and
care
for
the
cattle
and
deliver
them
in
the
morning
the
regulations
were
read
aloud
to
the
captains
and
this
rather
large
army
of
men
women
and
children
with
about
five
hundred
head
of
stock
moved
out
very
systematically
it
would
sometimes
be
fully
ten
before
the
rear
division
could
make
a
start
and
correspondingly
late
before
they
could
get
up
with
the
main
camp
at
night
they
got
along
very
well
but
cleaned
the
country
of
grass
for
some
distance
each
side
of
the
trail
as
they
swept
along
about
the
first
of
november
capt
smith
overtook
us
with
the
pack
train
and
camped
with
us
at
night
he
formed
many
acquaintances
and
told
them
he
was
going
to
take
a
shorter
route
and
save
five
hundred
miles
rather
than
take
the
long
route
by
way
of
los
angeles
he
had
a
map
of
his
proposed
route
and
it
was
very
much
like
the
one
we
had
he
also
stated
that
it
could
probably
be
as
easily
traveled
as
the
one
by
way
of
los
angeles
and
as
a
consequence
of
his
talk
fever
began
to
rage
in
camp
again
some
got
very
enthusiastic
in
the
matter
and
spoke
publicly
in
favor
of
following
capt
smith
when
he
should
come
to
the
place
when
his
short
route
turned
away
from
the
other
trail
his
plan
grew
so
much
in
favor
that
when
the
place
was
reached
a
hundred
wagons
turned
out
into
the
smith
trail
leaving
capt
hunt
only
the
seven
mormon
wagon
bound
for
san
bernardino
hunt
stood
at
the
forks
of
the
road
as
the
wagons
went
by
and
said
to
them
friends
i
can
not
according
to
my
agreement
go
with
you
for
i
was
hired
for
this
road
and
no
other
was
mentioned
i
am
in
duty
bound
to
go
even
if
only
one
wagon
decides
to
go
when
the
last
wagon
had
passed
him
he
still
stood
talking
with
several
who
had
chosen
the
new
way
and
told
them
they
were
taking
a
big
risk
for
they
did
not
know
very
much
about
the
route
and
he
had
been
thinking
that
they
might
find
it
pretty
rough
and
hard
to
get
over
the
first
time
he
said
that
if
all
decided
to
go
that
way
he
would
go
and
help
them
even
if
they
went
to
but
as
it
was
he
could
not
he
wished
them
luck
and
the
two
trains
parted
company
at
the
end
of
three
days
of
travel
on
the
smith
trail
they
came
to
the
top
of
a
long
steep
hill
the
trail
went
down
and
down
and
they
see
no
way
of
crossing
the
terribly
deep
cañon
that
was
before
them
so
they
went
into
camp
and
sent
explorers
out
to
investigate
and
find
a
crossing
if
possible
on
the
second
day
the
explorers
began
to
return
with
very
unfavorable
reports
and
many
who
found
their
progress
thus
blocked
turned
about
and
started
to
follow
hunt
most
of
the
wagons
which
remained
had
each
one
or
more
of
their
men
out
exploring
and
could
not
turn
back
until
their
return
several
of
the
jayhawkers
having
once
started
on
this
route
were
very
anxious
to
get
through
on
it
if
a
way
could
be
found
for
them
to
do
it
and
therefore
searched
farther
and
with
greater
determination
than
the
others
when
they
returned
they
reported
they
had
found
a
way
around
the
head
of
the
cañon
and
they
believed
it
to
be
the
right
way
the
map
williams
had
given
them
did
not
show
this
cañon
and
they
believed
it
to
be
correct
and
that
the
real
road
led
around
at
the
place
which
they
had
found
and
no
further
trouble
would
be
met
acting
on
this
report
about
twenty
wagons
including
the
jayhawkers
concluded
to
go
ahead
we
can
beat
the
other
fellows
a
month
said
they
and
so
they
hitched
up
and
pulled
out
in
a
northerly
direction
feeling
in
good
spirits
and
hopeful
of
success
they
named
this
place
mt
misery
while
camped
here
a
lone
and
seemingly
friendless
man
died
and
was
buried
none
seem
now
to
remember
his
name
but
think
he
was
from
kentucky
he
was
low
with
consumption
and
not
strong
enough
to
endure
the
hardships
of
the
journey
about
the
third
night
the
jayhawkers
were
overtaken
by
seven
more
wagons
owned
by
bennett
and
friends
arcane
and
family
two
men
named
earhart
and
a
son
of
one
of
them
and
one
or
two
other
wagons
the
jayhawker
train
was
made
up
of
men
from
many
states
but
seemed
well
united
and
was
as
complete
as
when
they
first
started
the
author
was
with
the
party
that
came
up
in
the
rear
which
had
started
later
but
traveled
faster
on
account
of
having
a
road
broken
for
them
he
visited
the
leaders
in
camp
when
they
were
discussing
the
necessity
of
forming
a
new
travelling
compact
to
help
and
protect
each
other
on
the
road
those
who
had
no
families
were
objecting
to
being
bound
to
those
who
had
women
and
children
with
them
they
argued
that
the
road
would
be
hard
and
difficult
and
those
wagons
with
women
and
children
would
require
more
assistance
than
they
would
be
able
to
render
in
return
they
said
they
could
go
back
and
follow
hunt
who
was
on
a
better
road
and
they
could
proceed
with
more
safely
among
those
with
this
train
was
rev
brier
his
wife
and
three
children
he
objected
to
being
turned
back
and
said
he
did
not
want
to
be
assisted
but
would
go
with
them
and
do
his
part
and
take
care
of
himself
the
author
listened
to
the
various
speeches
without
speaking
and
became
satisfied
that
it
would
end
in
every
one
looking
out
for
himself
in
case
of
hard
times
he
went
over
to
their
camp
again
the
next
night
and
wished
to
ask
them
why
they
were
steering
so
nearly
due
north
he
said
to
them
that
they
were
going
toward
salt
lake
rather
than
california
and
that
the
bennet
party
did
not
feel
inclined
to
follow
them
any
farther
in
that
direction
they
replied
that
their
map
told
them
to
go
north
a
day
or
more
and
then
they
would
find
the
route
as
represented
they
would
then
turn
west
and
reach
owen
lake
and
from
there
there
would
be
no
more
trouble
the
jayhawker
crowd
seemed
to
think
they
could
go
anywhere
and
no
difficulty
could
happen
which
they
could
overcome
bennett
little
train
turned
west
from
this
point
and
the
jayhawkers
went
on
north
but
before
night
they
changed
their
minds
and
came
following
on
after
bennett
whom
they
overtook
and
passed
again
taking
the
lead
thus
far
the
country
had
been
well
watered
and
furnished
plenty
of
grass
and
most
of
them
talked
and
believed
that
this
kind
of
rolling
country
would
last
all
the
way
through
the
men
at
leisure
scattered
around
over
the
hills
on
each
side
of
the
route
taken
by
the
train
and
in
advance
of
it
hunting
camping
places
and
making
a
regular
picnic
of
it
there
were
no
hardships
and
one
man
had
a
fiddle
which
he
tuned
up
evenings
and
gave
plenty
of
fine
music
joy
and
happiness
seemed
the
rule
and
all
of
the
train
were
certainly
having
a
good
time
of
it
but
gradually
there
came
a
change
as
the
wagon
wheels
rolled
westward
the
valleys
seemed
to
have
no
streams
in
them
and
the
mountain
ranges
grew
more
and
more
broken
and
in
the
lower
ground
a
dry
lake
could
be
found
and
water
and
grass
grew
scarce
so
much
so
that
both
men
and
oxen
suffered
these
dry
lake
beds
deceived
them
many
times
they
seemed
as
if
containing
plenty
of
water
and
off
the
men
would
go
to
explore
they
usually
found
the
distance
to
them
about
three
times
as
far
as
they
at
first
supposed
and
when
at
last
they
reached
them
they
found
no
water
but
a
dry
shining
bed
smooth
as
glass
but
just
clay
hard
as
a
rock
most
of
these
dry
lakes
showed
no
outlet
nor
any
inlet
for
that
matter
though
at
some
period
in
the
past
they
must
have
been
full
of
water
nothing
grew
in
the
shape
of
vegetables
or
plants
except
a
small
stunted
bitter
brush
away
to
the
west
and
north
there
was
much
broken
country
the
mountain
ranges
higher
and
rougher
and
more
barren
and
from
almost
every
sightly
elevation
there
appeared
one
or
more
of
these
dry
lake
beds
one
night
after
about
three
days
of
travel
the
whole
of
the
train
of
twenty
seven
wagons
was
camped
along
the
bank
of
one
of
these
lakes
this
one
with
a
very
little
water
in
it
not
more
than
one
fourth
or
one
half
an
inch
in
depth
and
yet
spread
out
to
the
width
of
a
mile
or
more
it
was
truly
providential
for
by
digging
holes
along
the
border
the
water
would
run
into
them
and
prove
abundant
for
all
both
oxen
and
men
if
it
had
proved
dry
as
so
many
before
had
proved
or
if
we
had
been
a
few
days
earlier
or
later
we
might
not
have
found
a
drop
this
proved
to
be
the
last
time
the
whole
twenty
seven
wagons
were
gathered
in
one
camp
together
the
author
came
into
camp
about
nine
in
the
evening
after
climbing
many
peaks
and
taking
a
survey
of
the
surrounding
country
with
a
field
glass
men
from
nearly
every
mess
came
to
him
to
inquire
what
he
had
seen
they
asked
all
sorts
of
questions
and
wanted
an
opinion
as
to
the
advisability
of
trailing
across
the
prairie
directly
west
which
then
seemed
easy
they
were
told
that
from
what
could
be
seen
from
the
summit
of
buttes
both
north
and
south
of
the
camp
ranging
a
hundred
or
so
miles
in
almost
every
direction
it
was
believed
no
water
could
be
found
between
the
present
camp
and
a
range
of
mountains
which
could
be
seen
crossing
the
route
far
to
the
west
well
said
capt
doty
of
the
jayhawkers
i
do
like
to
hear
such
discouraging
talk
from
manley
but
i
think
we
will
have
to
steer
straight
ahead
the
prospect
for
water
seems
to
be
about
the
same
west
or
south
and
i
can
not
see
that
we
would
better
ourselves
by
going
north
when
morning
came
capt
doty
and
his
party
yoked
up
and
set
out
straight
across
the
desert
leaving
seven
wagons
of
the
bennett
party
still
in
camp
for
some
time
all
of
us
had
seen
in
the
range
ahead
an
appearance
of
a
pass
or
lower
place
in
the
mountain
and
we
had
got
to
calling
it
martin
pass
naming
it
after
jim
martin
there
was
a
peak
just
to
the
south
of
it
and
the
pass
now
apparently
exactly
west
of
the
lake
camp
seemed
to
the
jayhawkers
easy
to
reach
their
wills
were
strong
enough
and
they
were
running
over
with
determination
and
energy
enough
to
carry
them
over
any
plain
no
matter
how
dry
or
barren
or
over
any
mountain
no
matter
how
rugged
and
steep
five
days
they
traveled
without
finding
water
and
small
supply
they
took
along
had
been
consumed
for
lack
of
water
they
could
not
eat
or
sleep
the
oxen
gathered
round
the
little
fire
and
seemed
to
beg
for
water
they
had
no
cud
to
chew
unless
it
was
the
cud
of
disappointment
the
range
of
mountains
they
had
been
aiming
for
still
seemed
far
away
and
the
possible
show
for
reaching
it
seemed
very
poor
indeed
and
the
prospect
of
any
water
hole
between
them
and
the
mountains
poorer
yet
hope
was
pretty
near
gone
martins
mess
unyoked
their
oxen
from
the
wagons
put
some
small
packs
on
their
own
backs
and
loaded
some
upon
the
backs
of
the
oxen
and
turned
south
toward
the
nearest
snowy
mountain
they
could
see
the
same
one
towards
which
the
bennett
party
steered
from
the
lake
camp
the
doty
party
kept
their
courage
longer
and
kept
on
straight
ahead
for
another
day
and
then
camped
almost
without
hope
no
rest
came
to
them
nor
sleep
towards
morning
as
they
stood
around
the
fire
a
stray
cloud
appeared
and
hid
the
stars
and
shortly
after
began
to
unload
a
cargo
of
snow
it
carried
they
spread
out
every
blanket
and
brushed
up
every
bit
they
could
from
the
smooth
places
kindled
a
little
fire
of
brush
under
the
camp
kettles
and
melted
all
the
snow
all
of
them
could
gather
besides
filling
their
mouths
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
hoping
that
it
would
full
in
sufficient
quantities
to
satisfy
themselves
and
the
oxen
and
quench
their
dreadful
thirst
slowly
the
cloud
moved
scattering
the
snowflakes
till
they
felt
relieved
the
last
time
the
author
conversed
with
a
member
of
this
party
was
in
and
it
was
conceded
that
this
storm
saved
the
lives
of
both
man
and
beast
in
that
little
band
of
jayhawkers
it
was
like
manna
falling
from
heaven
and
as
surely
saved
their
lives
as
did
the
manna
of
the
bible
save
the
lives
of
the
tribes
of
israel
they
had
no
reason
to
expect
a
storm
of
rain
or
snow
but
came
to
them
just
as
they
were
perishing
a
little
further
on
they
came
to
a
small
stream
of
water
and
as
the
bed
showed
only
a
recent
flow
it
must
also
have
come
from
the
little
local
storm
further
up
the
mountain
they
used
this
water
freely
even
though
it
was
not
very
good
and
it
acted
on
them
very
much
like
a
solution
of
glanber
salts
they
decided
at
first
that
they
had
better
follow
the
stream
southward
but
after
a
little
time
feeling
the
sickness
caused
by
the
water
they
saw
it
was
no
advantage
and
turned
west
again
bearing
to
the
north
toward
a
sort
of
pass
they
could
now
see
in
the
mountains
in
that
direction
this
stream
is
now
known
as
the
amargosa
or
bitter
river
the
new
direction
in
which
they
marched
gave
them
an
route
for
thirty
or
forty
miles
rough
and
barren
with
no
water
or
grass
there
was
no
road
or
trail
to
follow
the
oxen
were
as
weak
as
their
owners
from
drinking
the
bitter
water
and
the
road
needed
some
clearing
and
breaking
in
places
before
the
wagons
could
pass
they
moved
quite
slowly
and
reached
the
summit
on
the
second
night
with
the
loss
of
a
single
ox
the
author
would
say
here
that
this
was
the
last
ox
which
was
allowed
to
die
without
using
the
flesh
for
food
and
it
was
from
this
same
one
he
cut
a
steak
to
eat
on
christmas
eve
from
the
summit
they
took
a
way
down
a
dark
deep
cañon
having
a
steep
slope
and
very
rocky
and
bad
but
down
which
the
oxen
drew
their
loads
much
easier
than
when
they
came
up
reaching
water
on
the
third
day
where
there
were
many
springs
and
a
sort
of
coarse
grass
for
the
oxen
the
place
is
now
known
as
furnace
creek
the
jayhawkers
passed
on
and
here
at
these
very
springs
was
where
the
author
overtook
the
rev
brier
delivering
a
lecture
to
his
children
on
the
benefits
of
an
early
education
as
referred
to
in
his
narrative
as
the
jayhawkers
drove
out
of
this
furnace
creek
cañon
the
valley
into
which
they
came
was
very
narrow
the
high
mountain
before
them
seemed
steeper
and
rougher
than
ever
so
steep
in
fact
that
it
could
not
be
ascended
by
a
man
on
foot
a
short
distance
below
could
be
seen
a
lake
containing
water
and
the
pass
toward
which
they
had
been
directing
their
course
seemed
to
the
north
of
them
they
therefore
turned
their
course
in
that
direction
the
road
was
sandy
and
the
brush
that
grew
on
it
was
only
a
few
inches
high
on
their
way
they
came
to
an
abandoned
indian
camp
occupied
by
one
poor
old
blind
red
man
he
would
hold
his
mouth
open
like
a
young
bird
begging
for
something
to
eat
one
man
dropped
kernels
of
parched
corn
into
his
mouth
but
instead
of
eating
them
he
quickly
spit
them
out
it
seemed
that
he
had
been
left
to
die
and
could
not
or
would
not
his
hair
was
white
as
snow
his
skin
looked
about
the
color
of
a
smoked
ham
and
so
crippled
was
he
that
he
crawled
about
like
a
beast
on
all
fours
it
was
barely
possible
that
he
had
been
left
to
watch
and
that
his
great
infirmities
were
only
pretended
but
they
seemed
genuine
enough
and
were
doubtless
true
they
left
him
in
peaceable
possession
of
the
spot
and
traveled
on
they
approached
the
base
of
the
mountain
in
front
of
what
they
had
all
along
supposed
to
be
a
pass
and
found
as
they
had
lately
begun
to
suspect
that
there
was
no
pass
that
their
wagons
could
be
taken
through
and
they
must
be
abandoned
the
camp
was
poor
what
little
water
there
was
had
a
salty
taste
and
they
could
only
find
here
and
there
a
bunch
of
the
poorest
grass
the
oxen
stood
around
as
if
utterly
dispirited
and
would
sometimes
make
a
faint
effort
to
pick
up
and
eat
some
of
the
dry
brush
that
grew
around
the
desolate
camp
this
camp
is
now
known
to
be
in
the
northern
part
of
death
valley
but
then
they
knew
no
names
for
anything
but
if
dreariness
and
absence
of
life
and
threatened
danger
all
around
were
any
indication
they
might
well
have
named
it
death
valley
as
was
afterwards
done
by
the
party
with
whom
the
author
traveled
the
party
had
been
brave
till
now
but
when
they
realized
that
they
must
make
pack
animals
of
themselves
and
trudge
on
they
knew
not
where
perhaps
to
only
a
lingering
death
the
keen
edge
of
disappointment
cut
close
and
they
realized
how
desolate
they
were
they
felt
much
inclined
to
attribute
all
their
troubles
to
the
advice
of
the
mormons
some
said
that
the
plan
was
thus
to
wipe
so
many
more
hated
gentiles
out
of
the
way
and
wishes
were
deep
and
loud
that
the
mormons
might
all
be
buried
out
of
sight
in
the
great
salt
lake
they
thought
lot
wife
must
have
been
turned
to
salt
in
the
neighborhood
everything
was
so
impregnated
with
saline
substances
and
the
same
result
might
come
to
them
but
the
inherent
manhood
of
the
little
band
came
to
their
relief
and
they
determined
not
to
die
without
a
struggle
for
escape
and
life
they
killed
some
of
their
oxen
and
took
the
wood
of
their
wagons
and
kindled
fires
to
dry
and
smoke
the
flesh
so
it
would
be
light
and
easy
to
carry
with
them
they
scattered
all
surplus
baggage
around
the
ground
carefully
storing
and
saving
the
bit
of
bread
that
yet
remained
and
dividing
it
equally
among
the
party
they
also
divided
the
tea
coffee
rice
and
some
such
things
and
each
one
agreed
that
he
could
not
ask
aught
of
his
neighbor
more
knapsacks
were
improvised
from
parts
of
the
wagon
canvas
and
long
strips
of
canvas
were
made
into
a
sort
of
pack
harness
for
the
oxen
it
was
a
sad
sight
to
see
the
strong
and
vigorous
young
men
of
a
few
days
ago
reduced
to
such
straits
almost
skeletons
now
with
no
hope
of
nourishment
to
invigorate
them
they
made
canteens
by
sewing
a
couple
of
small
powder
cans
in
cloth
with
a
band
to
go
over
the
shoulders
the
jayhawkers
were
still
making
their
preparations
when
the
martin
party
and
rev
brier
and
family
came
up
to
their
camp
having
taken
a
circuit
around
farther
to
the
south
the
martin
party
was
already
in
marching
order
and
this
camp
was
so
poor
that
they
did
not
wait
but
gave
all
their
oxen
they
had
left
to
brier
and
said
they
could
get
on
faster
without
them
they
took
a
straight
course
over
the
hills
and
up
the
mountain
saying
they
believed
they
had
provisions
enough
upon
their
backs
to
last
them
through
and
that
nothing
should
check
their
progress
till
they
reached
the
other
side
where
they
said
were
fertile
valleys
and
plenty
of
chance
to
live
the
doty
party
or
jayhawkers
when
they
were
ready
started
first
a
northerly
course
to
find
a
more
favorable
place
to
cross
the
range
and
drove
their
oxen
with
them
each
with
a
small
pack
they
soon
came
to
some
good
water
and
after
refreshing
themselves
turned
westward
to
cross
the
great
mountain
before
them
both
men
and
oxen
were
shod
with
moccasins
made
of
to
protect
the
feet
against
sharp
rocks
they
could
see
no
trail
but
merely
picked
out
the
best
way
to
go
while
climbing
the
steep
mountain
side
they
came
across
a
dead
ox
left
by
some
party
that
had
gone
before
them
they
cut
out
the
tongue
and
some
of
the
best
meat
and
ate
it
to
eke
out
their
own
small
stock
and
carried
some
pieces
with
them
but
soon
threw
it
all
away
but
enough
for
a
roast
for
supper
when
it
was
getting
dark
they
were
almost
at
the
summit
but
there
was
no
good
camping
place
and
they
saw
a
small
fire
light
at
a
little
distance
and
went
to
it
finding
a
poor
lone
camper
taking
care
of
himself
they
camped
here
also
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
many
men
from
the
various
parties
scattered
all
around
the
country
each
one
seeking
out
the
path
which
seemed
to
suit
best
his
tender
feet
or
present
fancy
steering
west
as
well
as
mountains
and
cañon
would
permit
some
farther
north
some
farther
south
and
generally
demoralized
each
thinking
that
as
a
last
resort
he
would
be
able
to
save
his
own
life
it
seemed
to
be
a
question
of
will
and
endurance
strong
hearts
and
keeping
the
body
in
motion
the
weak
and
faint
must
fail
and
the
strong
said
to
the
weak
stand
up
be
a
man
do
fall
down
and
so
the
strong
spurred
on
the
weak
and
kept
them
up
as
best
they
could
down
the
mountain
they
went
on
the
west
side
and
instead
of
los
angeles
which
some
of
them
expected
to
see
they
saw
only
a
salt
lake
in
the
midst
of
a
barren
desert
valley
and
their
route
lay
directly
across
it
they
traveled
in
several
directions
as
they
went
across
one
went
across
the
valley
on
a
strip
of
dried
mud
between
two
small
lakes
others
followed
down
along
the
east
side
of
the
lake
near
the
foot
of
the
mountain
where
they
found
some
good
water
and
an
old
indian
camp
they
found
some
mosquite
beans
which
they
did
not
know
were
of
much
use
but
really
if
they
had
known
how
to
fix
them
up
a
little
they
would
have
been
good
food
capt
doty
mess
crossed
between
the
lakes
on
the
strip
of
dry
mud
while
others
went
on
where
it
was
still
soft
and
left
marks
of
their
both
parties
turned
up
a
small
cañon
on
the
west
side
and
began
the
ascent
of
a
black
and
barren
range
containing
no
water
but
in
the
bed
of
the
ravine
near
the
summit
they
found
some
damp
sand
and
tried
to
dig
with
their
hands
to
find
some
of
the
precious
fluid
but
no
water
came
and
in
the
morning
one
of
their
number
mr
fish
died
and
was
left
unburied
on
the
barren
rocks
no
doubt
his
bones
could
be
found
there
turning
west
again
they
had
a
down
grade
over
a
most
barren
and
rocky
road
for
many
miles
the
prospect
from
this
point
was
any
thing
but
cheering
to
the
left
a
large
lake
could
be
seen
and
from
their
previous
experience
they
concluded
it
to
be
salt
and
the
valley
they
were
coming
to
was
very
sandy
and
the
hardest
sort
of
footing
for
men
and
animals
as
weak
as
those
of
the
party
were
it
must
be
crossed
before
there
was
any
possibility
of
water
and
when
across
it
was
quite
uncertain
whether
they
could
obtain
any
one
of
their
number
had
already
died
of
thirst
and
fatigue
and
all
were
suffering
terribly
the
valley
seemed
about
eight
miles
across
and
before
they
were
half
way
over
ischam
one
of
their
party
sat
down
perfectly
exhausted
and
said
he
could
not
take
another
step
no
one
was
able
to
assist
him
or
give
him
a
drink
of
water
and
they
could
not
tarry
to
see
if
rest
would
refresh
him
they
could
only
look
sadly
at
him
and
pass
on
in
silence
for
he
seemed
fast
wasting
away
the
thought
came
to
everyone
that
perhaps
it
would
be
his
turn
next
to
sit
down
and
see
the
others
pass
on
in
fact
the
probability
of
any
more
of
them
living
another
day
was
very
poor
for
they
all
grew
weaker
and
weaker
with
every
hour
and
no
one
knew
how
many
hours
must
pass
before
they
could
hope
for
water
there
was
not
moisture
enough
in
their
poor
bodies
to
make
tears
and
no
one
dare
open
his
mouth
lest
all
the
moisture
suddenly
evaporate
and
respiration
cease
those
who
had
no
cattle
took
different
courses
to
reach
the
hills
and
mountains
on
the
west
side
of
this
valley
hoping
there
to
find
water
and
signal
to
the
others
if
they
were
successful
all
except
the
two
men
managed
to
get
across
and
finding
no
water
the
packs
were
taken
from
the
oxen
and
they
were
driven
to
the
lake
which
appeared
on
the
left
reaching
the
lake
they
found
the
water
red
in
color
and
so
strong
of
alkali
that
no
man
or
beast
could
take
a
single
swallow
they
drove
the
cattle
back
again
with
sad
hearts
and
almost
despondent
for
in
the
rough
dry
rocks
of
the
mountains
there
seemed
no
signs
of
water
but
they
were
saved
again
those
who
bore
farthest
to
the
right
in
their
course
to
the
mountains
steering
toward
a
pile
of
tremendous
rocks
found
a
little
stream
of
good
water
which
flowed
only
a
short
distance
and
then
sank
into
the
sand
this
good
news
spread
rapidly
and
all
soon
gathered
at
the
little
streamlet
it
was
slow
work
getting
water
for
them
all
but
by
being
patient
they
were
all
filled
up
some
took
two
canteens
of
water
and
hurried
back
to
ischam
whom
they
found
still
alive
but
his
mouth
and
throat
so
dry
and
parched
and
his
strength
so
small
that
he
was
unable
to
swallow
a
single
drop
and
while
they
waited
he
breathed
his
last
with
their
hands
and
feet
they
dug
away
the
sand
for
a
shallow
grave
placed
the
body
in
it
covered
it
with
his
blankets
and
then
scraped
the
sand
back
over
again
to
make
a
little
mound
over
their
dead
comrade
perhaps
if
he
could
have
walked
a
mile
farther
he
might
have
lived
and
but
for
the
little
trickling
stream
of
water
from
the
rocks
they
might
all
be
dead
so
slight
were
the
circumstances
that
turned
the
scale
to
balance
toward
life
or
death
there
was
so
little
feed
for
oxen
that
they
could
gain
no
strength
but
were
much
refreshed
by
the
water
and
could
still
travel
one
was
killed
here
and
the
meat
poor
as
it
was
gave
the
men
new
strength
they
all
guessed
it
to
be
at
least
fifty
miles
to
the
base
of
the
great
snow
mountain
before
them
and
what
there
was
between
no
one
could
tell
for
there
were
hills
and
valleys
between
leaving
the
little
spring
their
course
led
first
up
a
small
cañon
and
when
they
reached
the
summit
of
the
ridge
a
small
valley
covered
with
sage
brush
was
before
them
the
most
fertile
spot
they
had
seen
for
a
long
time
the
descent
to
this
valley
was
through
another
cañon
which
was
filled
with
large
boulders
for
much
of
the
way
and
over
these
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
get
the
cattle
they
had
seen
no
water
since
leaving
the
little
stream
and
the
plain
they
were
now
approaching
seemed
thirty
miles
wide
with
no
signs
of
streams
or
springs
however
just
at
the
foot
of
the
cañon
they
found
a
small
water
hole
but
the
water
was
so
salt
that
even
the
oxen
refused
to
drink
it
they
decided
to
make
a
push
across
the
plain
and
endeavor
to
reach
the
other
side
in
two
days
and
they
knew
there
could
be
no
water
on
its
even
expanse
the
plain
seemed
quite
an
up
grade
from
where
they
were
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
on
the
second
day
they
all
reached
the
point
they
were
aiming
for
except
rev
brier
and
family
and
they
came
in
one
day
behind
every
one
looked
out
for
himself
and
had
no
time
nor
strength
to
spare
to
help
others
here
on
a
small
bench
overlooking
the
country
to
the
south
and
east
but
still
a
long
distance
from
the
snow
they
found
some
holes
of
water
and
some
bunch
grass
a
little
farther
up
the
hill
here
was
a
large
trail
coming
from
the
north
and
leading
from
this
point
westward
there
were
no
signs
of
recent
use
but
there
were
many
indications
that
it
was
quite
ancient
and
had
been
considerably
traveled
in
time
past
this
was
quite
encouraging
to
many
of
them
and
they
declared
they
would
follow
this
trail
which
would
surely
lead
to
some
place
well
known
in
a
better
country
they
cared
not
whether
it
led
to
california
mexico
or
texas
only
that
they
might
get
out
of
this
country
which
seemed
accursed
any
place
where
they
could
get
something
to
eat
and
drink
would
be
better
than
this
and
brier
had
some
pretty
hard
struggles
to
get
along
and
everyone
of
this
party
has
ever
been
loud
in
praise
of
the
energy
and
determination
of
the
brave
little
woman
of
the
brier
mess
all
agreed
that
she
was
by
far
the
best
man
of
the
party
she
was
the
one
who
put
the
packs
on
the
oxen
in
the
morning
she
it
was
who
took
them
off
at
night
built
the
fires
cooked
the
food
helped
the
children
and
did
all
sorts
of
work
when
the
father
of
the
family
was
too
tired
which
was
almost
all
of
the
time
they
all
said
that
he
like
other
ministers
had
fallen
out
with
any
work
but
that
of
the
tongue
and
seemed
perfectly
willing
for
some
one
else
to
do
the
work
brier
had
the
sympathy
of
everyone
and
many
would
have
helped
her
if
they
could
she
waited
on
her
big
husband
with
untiring
zeal
and
still
had
time
to
care
for
the
children
with
all
of
a
mother
love
it
seemed
almost
impossible
that
one
little
woman
could
do
so
much
it
was
entirely
to
her
untiring
devotion
that
her
husband
and
children
lived
brier
had
but
little
sympathy
or
help
from
any
one
but
her
some
were
quite
sarcastic
in
their
remarks
about
the
invalid
preacher
who
never
earned
his
bread
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
and
by
their
actions
showed
that
they
did
not
care
very
much
whether
he
ever
got
through
or
not
they
thought
he
ought
to
have
asserted
his
manliness
and
taken
the
burden
on
himself
and
not
lean
upon
his
delicate
and
trusting
wife
as
he
seemed
to
do
all
are
sure
that
it
is
to
his
faithful
wife
the
rev
brier
owed
his
succor
from
the
sands
of
that
desert
looking
back
on
the
scenes
of
that
day
the
way
the
selfish
dispositions
of
people
were
made
manifest
is
almost
incredible
every
one
seemed
to
think
only
of
saving
his
own
life
and
every
spark
of
human
sympathy
and
kindness
seemed
extinguished
a
man
would
drink
the
last
cup
of
water
even
if
his
neighbor
choked
this
camp
was
the
same
one
which
the
author
mentions
in
his
narrative
to
which
rogers
and
himself
crept
so
silently
and
carefully
at
night
to
ascertain
whether
the
occupants
were
friends
or
foes
they
were
much
pleased
to
find
it
was
capt
doty
of
the
jayhawkers
and
his
mess
who
had
remained
behind
to
dry
the
flesh
of
an
ox
they
had
killed
when
it
could
travel
no
longer
the
others
had
gone
on
ahead
following
the
trail
leaving
these
to
follow
they
staid
here
two
days
and
it
was
while
waiting
here
that
the
rev
brier
came
up
as
before
related
and
they
all
went
on
together
when
they
moved
nearly
every
man
had
carried
a
gun
in
the
early
days
of
the
expedition
hoping
to
kill
game
and
to
be
well
armed
in
case
of
attack
by
indians
or
enemies
but
they
began
to
find
that
they
were
useless
encumbrances
and
first
one
and
then
another
would
throw
away
his
as
a
burden
too
great
for
a
weary
man
to
bear
there
was
no
game
and
the
poor
weak
men
hardly
deemed
their
own
lives
worth
defending
against
an
enemy
when
a
day
or
two
of
lack
of
water
would
end
the
matter
of
life
at
any
rate
as
they
slept
they
dreamed
the
most
tantalizing
dreams
of
clear
rippling
brooks
of
water
of
wading
knee
deep
in
the
most
beautiful
of
ponds
of
hoisting
the
old
bucket
from
some
deep
old
well
of
breaking
and
eating
great
white
loaves
of
bread
of
surrounding
the
home
table
with
its
load
of
steaming
beans
and
bacon
fragrant
coffee
and
delicious
fried
cakes
with
such
dreams
of
comfort
they
awoke
to
realize
more
fully
the
terrors
of
their
dry
and
swollen
throats
the
discomfort
of
empty
stomachs
water
and
food
were
the
great
riches
of
life
to
them
then
had
piles
of
pieces
been
on
the
one
hand
and
a
bucket
of
cold
water
on
the
other
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
choice
that
would
have
been
made
seven
or
eight
miles
from
this
place
were
two
branches
to
the
trail
one
led
into
the
mountains
toward
the
snow
and
the
other
still
bore
southerly
they
could
see
that
some
other
party
who
had
no
oxen
to
drive
had
taken
the
more
northerly
route
which
seemed
to
lead
more
directly
in
the
direction
of
the
mines
of
california
those
who
came
later
with
animals
thought
it
would
be
folly
to
try
to
cross
the
deep
snow
they
could
see
on
the
mountains
before
them
and
concluded
that
it
would
be
safer
to
the
south
of
the
snow
line
braving
the
danger
of
scarcity
of
water
rather
than
to
perish
in
the
snow
capt
doty
was
willing
to
attempt
the
northern
branch
of
the
trail
if
the
others
so
decided
but
the
general
feeling
was
in
favor
of
the
more
plain
and
open
trail
which
led
away
from
the
snows
it
is
known
that
this
northern
branch
led
over
what
is
known
as
walker
pass
coming
out
at
the
kern
river
taking
then
the
southern
branch
the
party
passed
through
a
range
of
low
mountains
and
then
the
country
before
them
seemed
quite
level
for
a
hundred
miles
they
expected
they
would
find
much
difficulty
on
account
of
water
as
their
experience
had
taught
them
that
it
was
very
scarce
in
such
locations
but
this
trail
when
they
came
to
follow
it
led
them
for
eight
or
ten
miles
over
a
level
piece
of
high
land
that
looked
as
if
it
might
have
slid
down
from
the
high
mountain
at
some
day
long
past
and
this
easily
traveled
road
brought
them
at
last
to
the
top
of
a
steep
hill
down
which
they
went
and
found
near
the
bottom
a
small
weak
stream
of
water
but
no
grass
and
but
little
fuel
of
any
kind
this
was
the
same
camp
at
which
rogers
and
the
author
overtook
the
advance
party
here
they
killed
an
ox
which
made
a
good
meal
for
all
and
not
much
remained
over
for
many
had
no
oxen
and
were
getting
out
of
all
sorts
of
provisions
they
depended
much
on
the
generosity
of
their
fellow
travelers
many
of
them
stood
back
and
waited
till
those
who
owned
the
food
were
satisfied
and
were
very
grateful
when
they
were
invited
to
take
even
the
poorest
morsels
they
could
count
the
oxen
and
make
a
pretty
close
guess
of
how
many
days
they
could
live
in
this
way
even
with
the
best
probable
fortune
favoring
them
and
to
the
best
of
them
there
was
but
little
hope
and
to
those
who
were
dependent
it
seemed
as
if
the
fate
of
fish
and
ischam
might
be
theirs
almost
any
day
when
the
author
conversed
with
them
at
this
camp
he
found
them
the
first
really
men
he
had
ever
seen
some
were
men
of
middle
age
who
had
left
good
farms
that
gave
them
every
need
and
these
they
had
left
to
seek
a
yellow
phantom
and
now
there
were
yellow
phantoms
of
a
different
sort
rearing
their
dreadful
forms
all
about
them
they
called
themselves
foolish
gold
hunters
to
forsake
a
land
of
plenty
for
a
chance
to
leave
their
bones
in
a
hot
desert
more
eyes
than
one
filled
with
tears
and
hopes
in
more
than
one
breast
vanished
to
almost
nothing
more
than
one
would
gladly
have
placed
himself
back
where
he
could
have
been
assured
of
the
poorest
fare
he
ever
saw
upon
his
farm
for
bread
and
water
would
have
been
an
assurance
of
life
of
which
there
seemed
to
be
really
but
little
expectation
here
when
they
left
this
camp
in
the
cañon
the
trail
was
between
two
high
rocks
rising
like
walls
on
each
side
in
one
place
they
were
so
near
together
that
an
ox
could
hardly
squeeze
through
in
a
very
short
time
they
came
to
a
bunch
of
willows
growing
out
in
the
open
ground
the
little
bunch
or
grove
was
forty
or
fifty
feet
in
diameter
and
in
the
center
was
a
spring
of
water
the
center
of
the
clump
had
been
cleared
out
making
a
sort
of
corral
of
bushes
enclosing
the
spring
on
the
outside
there
was
quite
a
little
growth
of
grass
which
was
a
fortunate
thing
for
their
poor
beasts
away
in
the
distance
rising
up
a
little
against
the
western
sky
they
could
see
mountains
with
snow
on
them
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
a
journey
of
five
or
six
days
to
reach
them
but
the
good
water
and
the
grass
bolstered
up
their
spirits
wonderfully
for
there
was
present
relief
and
rather
better
prospects
ahead
they
were
pretty
sure
that
the
wide
plain
held
no
water
everything
that
would
hold
the
precious
drink
was
filled
and
the
best
preparations
made
for
what
they
believed
was
to
be
the
final
struggle
for
life
they
rested
one
day
and
prepared
for
the
very
worst
that
might
before
them
early
in
the
morning
when
they
could
see
plainest
they
looked
across
the
expanse
before
them
and
really
it
did
not
seem
quite
so
barren
hot
and
desolate
as
the
region
they
had
passed
and
they
talked
and
hoped
that
this
would
be
the
last
desert
they
must
cross
and
that
los
angeles
lay
just
beyond
the
sunny
ridge
they
could
dimly
see
ahead
there
were
some
tears
that
more
than
one
would
not
live
to
answer
roll
call
on
the
other
side
but
it
was
the
last
hope
and
worth
an
earnest
active
trial
early
in
the
morning
much
refreshed
they
started
on
again
with
rather
sober
faces
that
night
one
man
insisted
on
sleeping
with
his
clothes
and
boots
all
on
for
he
said
if
he
died
he
wanted
to
die
in
full
dress
another
day
and
some
thought
they
could
see
trees
on
the
mountains
ahead
of
them
and
this
renewed
their
courage
greatly
in
the
middle
of
the
day
they
suffered
greatly
with
the
heat
and
the
dry
air
seemed
to
drink
up
every
bit
of
moisture
from
everybody
when
they
killed
an
ox
they
saved
the
blood
and
ate
it
the
intestines
cleaned
with
the
fingers
made
food
when
roasted
on
the
fire
and
pieces
of
hide
singed
and
roasted
helped
to
sustain
life
the
water
was
nearly
all
gone
only
power
of
will
and
strength
of
body
had
kept
any
capt
asa
haines
sat
down
one
day
and
said
he
could
go
no
farther
but
his
comrade
stephens
who
had
kept
a
little
rice
a
little
tea
and
a
dry
crust
of
bread
for
time
of
need
took
a
little
water
in
a
cup
and
made
some
soup
which
he
forced
his
friend
to
eat
and
soon
he
revived
and
was
able
to
move
on
again
that
was
true
friendship
the
next
night
stevens
himself
awoke
and
seemed
perishing
with
thirst
he
crawled
over
to
doty
bed
and
begged
for
just
one
sup
of
water
doty
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
took
his
canteen
from
under
his
head
divided
the
last
few
drops
with
him
and
the
death
which
threatened
him
was
held
off
capt
doty
found
it
necessary
to
talk
very
seriously
to
those
who
mourned
and
talked
of
failing
he
never
gave
up
in
the
least
he
encouraged
all
to
make
every
step
they
could
and
know
no
such
word
as
fail
when
they
said
that
death
would
be
easier
than
life
he
told
them
so
but
that
life
was
possible
if
they
only
willed
it
and
a
better
life
than
had
been
theirs
and
so
he
kept
them
encouraged
and
kept
them
putting
one
foot
before
the
other
pointing
out
the
ever
lessening
distance
to
the
mountain
before
them
he
appealed
to
their
manhood
be
men
said
he
be
brave
and
courageous
and
you
have
more
strength
than
you
believe
thus
by
example
and
words
he
proved
to
be
a
true
captain
to
his
little
band
their
water
was
all
gone
every
drop
and
still
the
seemed
far
away
the
supply
of
meat
ran
out
tom
shannon
killed
an
ox
and
when
those
who
had
cattle
had
taken
some
the
others
who
had
none
were
told
to
divide
the
rest
there
was
no
water
to
dress
or
cook
it
but
it
helped
to
sustain
life
entrails
bones
sinews
bits
of
hide
and
everything
was
used
one
man
was
seen
with
an
ox
horn
burning
the
end
in
the
fire
and
gnawing
away
at
the
softened
portion
it
was
something
terrible
to
see
human
beings
eating
what
the
dogs
would
cast
aside
one
man
saw
some
moist
looking
earth
on
the
shady
side
of
a
bunch
of
brush
and
he
dug
down
and
got
a
handful
of
it
from
which
he
tried
to
suck
the
moisture
he
failed
and
the
bad
taste
of
the
earth
made
him
suffer
more
than
before
many
bones
of
horses
and
cattle
now
appeared
along
the
trail
they
seemed
to
have
been
there
a
long
time
and
some
were
partly
decayed
on
this
waterless
stretch
one
of
their
number
a
frenchman
wandered
off
searching
for
water
in
little
hollows
or
puddles
and
never
came
back
to
camp
he
was
supposed
to
be
dead
but
ten
years
afterward
some
surveyors
found
him
in
a
digger
indian
camp
an
idea
how
selfish
men
will
get
under
such
circumstances
may
be
gained
by
relating
that
on
one
occasion
when
an
ox
was
killed
the
liver
was
carried
to
the
brave
little
brier
for
herself
and
children
and
she
laid
it
aside
for
a
few
moments
till
she
could
attend
to
some
other
duties
before
cooking
it
darkness
coming
on
meanwhile
some
unprincipled
ungallant
thief
stole
it
and
only
bits
of
offal
and
almost
uneatable
pieces
were
left
to
sustain
their
lives
that
any
one
could
steal
the
last
morsel
from
a
woman
and
her
children
surpasses
belief
but
yet
it
was
plain
that
there
was
at
least
one
man
in
the
party
who
could
do
it
no
one
can
fully
understand
or
describe
such
scenes
as
this
unless
he
has
looked
into
just
such
hungry
looking
haggard
eyes
and
faces
a
mixture
of
determination
and
despair
the
human
expression
almost
vanishing
and
the
face
of
a
starving
wolf
or
jackal
taking
its
place
there
are
no
words
to
paint
such
a
state
of
things
to
him
who
has
never
seen
and
known
but
there
were
true
men
true
charitable
hearts
in
that
little
band
though
death
stared
them
in
the
face
they
never
forgot
their
fellow
men
as
they
slowly
crawled
along
many
would
wander
here
and
there
beside
the
trail
and
fall
behind
especially
the
weaker
ones
and
many
were
the
predictions
that
such
and
such
a
one
would
never
come
up
again
or
reach
the
camp
then
it
was
that
these
noble
souls
tired
almost
beyond
recovery
themselves
would
take
water
and
go
back
to
seek
the
wandering
ones
and
give
them
drink
and
help
them
on
more
than
one
would
thus
have
perished
in
the
sands
but
for
the
little
canteen
of
water
carried
back
by
some
friend
only
a
swallow
or
two
would
often
revive
their
failing
strength
and
courage
and
with
slow
step
they
would
move
on
again
how
much
good
a
crust
of
bread
would
have
done
such
a
poor
creature
bread
there
was
none
nothing
but
the
flesh
of
their
poor
oxen
wasted
and
consumed
by
days
of
travel
and
lack
of
food
till
it
had
no
goodness
in
it
even
the
poor
oxen
every
night
seemed
to
be
the
end
of
their
walking
every
morning
it
was
feared
that
that
would
be
the
last
time
they
would
be
able
to
rise
upon
their
feet
already
five
or
six
days
had
passed
since
they
left
the
camp
at
the
willows
where
they
had
their
last
supply
of
water
and
still
they
were
on
the
desert
the
journey
was
longer
than
they
had
expected
partly
owing
to
the
slow
progress
they
had
made
for
there
were
frequent
stops
to
rest
or
they
could
not
move
at
all
the
mountains
seemed
nearer
every
day
and
the
trees
were
outlined
more
plainly
each
morning
as
they
started
out
capt
doty
used
every
circumstance
to
encourage
them
he
would
remark
upon
the
favorable
signs
of
water
in
the
hills
before
them
and
the
hope
that
there
might
be
some
game
to
provide
better
meat
than
that
of
starving
oxen
thus
he
renewed
their
hope
and
kept
alive
their
courage
he
must
have
had
a
great
deal
of
fortitude
to
hide
his
own
sad
feelings
for
they
must
as
surely
have
come
to
him
as
to
any
one
and
to
keep
up
always
an
air
of
hope
courage
and
determination
to
succeed
if
he
had
been
a
man
of
less
spirit
and
good
judgment
it
is
very
probable
that
many
more
would
have
been
left
by
the
wayside
to
die
about
this
point
the
trail
which
had
been
growing
fainter
and
fainter
seemed
to
vanish
entirely
one
could
move
in
almost
any
direction
to
right
or
left
as
he
chose
and
because
of
this
previous
travel
had
doubtless
scattered
and
thus
left
no
trail
it
was
thought
best
that
this
company
should
spread
out
and
approach
the
mountains
in
as
broad
a
front
as
possible
so
as
to
multiply
the
chances
of
finding
water
and
so
they
started
out
in
pairs
some
to
the
right
and
some
to
the
left
each
selecting
the
point
where
water
seemed
most
probable
tom
shannon
and
a
companion
were
one
of
these
pairs
tom
was
one
of
the
few
who
still
stuck
to
his
gun
for
he
felt
that
it
might
save
his
life
sometime
he
and
his
companion
separated
about
a
mile
each
looking
at
all
points
that
showed
the
least
sign
of
water
suddenly
a
jack
rabbit
started
from
a
bush
the
first
game
shannon
had
seen
for
more
than
a
month
he
pulled
the
rifle
on
him
as
he
was
making
some
big
bound
and
had
the
good
luck
to
nearly
split
his
head
open
rushing
up
to
his
game
he
put
his
mouth
to
the
wound
and
sucked
the
warm
blood
as
it
flowed
for
it
was
the
first
liquid
he
had
seen
but
instead
of
allaying
his
fearful
thirst
it
seemed
to
make
it
worse
and
he
seemed
delirious
a
little
way
up
the
gulch
he
saw
a
rock
and
a
green
bush
and
steered
for
it
but
found
no
water
he
sat
down
with
his
back
to
the
rock
his
rifle
leaning
up
near
by
pulled
his
old
worn
hat
over
his
eyes
and
suffered
an
agony
of
sickness
he
realized
that
life
was
leaving
his
body
and
there
he
sat
with
no
power
to
move
and
no
desire
to
make
an
effort
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
see
plain
before
him
all
the
trail
from
where
he
sat
back
over
all
the
deserts
mountains
and
rivers
to
the
old
place
in
illinois
he
entirely
forgot
the
present
and
seemed
unconscious
of
everything
but
the
pictures
of
the
past
the
mind
seemed
growing
freer
from
its
attachment
to
the
body
and
at
liberty
to
take
in
his
whole
past
life
and
bright
scenes
that
had
gone
before
how
long
he
sat
thus
he
knows
not
his
companion
was
fortunate
in
finding
water
and
when
he
had
refreshed
himself
he
set
out
to
find
poor
tom
of
whom
he
could
see
nothing
going
toward
where
he
heard
the
shot
he
followed
on
till
he
saw
him
at
the
rock
almost
doubled
up
with
his
face
concealed
by
his
hat
o
tom
said
he
but
there
came
no
answering
motion
and
going
nearer
he
called
again
and
still
no
answer
and
no
sign
poor
tom
had
surely
passed
on
to
the
better
land
thought
he
and
salvation
was
so
near
he
approached
and
lifted
the
hat
rim
there
was
a
movement
of
the
eyes
a
quivering
of
the
muscles
of
the
face
and
a
sort
of
stare
such
as
precedes
approaching
dissolution
quickly
holding
back
his
head
he
poured
water
between
his
lips
from
his
canteen
and
it
was
swallowed
then
a
little
more
and
then
some
more
and
life
seemed
coming
back
again
into
a
troublesome
world
bringing
pain
with
it
and
the
consciousness
of
a
suffering
body
after
a
time
he
felt
better
and
was
helped
to
his
feet
and
together
they
went
to
the
water
hole
where
they
made
a
fire
and
cooked
the
rabbit
which
was
the
first
savory
meat
they
had
tasted
for
a
long
time
tom
felt
better
and
told
his
companion
how
he
felt
after
tasting
the
warm
rabbit
blood
and
how
he
had
nearly
gone
off
into
the
sleep
of
death
if
you
had
been
a
little
longer
finding
me
said
tom
i
should
soon
have
been
out
of
this
sad
world
they
fired
a
signal
gun
looked
down
at
the
bones
of
the
rabbit
drank
more
water
and
gradually
felt
new
life
coming
to
them
the
mountains
seemed
more
fertile
and
there
was
brush
and
grass
near
by
timber
farther
up
and
still
higher
a
cap
of
snow
extending
far
along
the
range
both
north
and
south
towards
night
on
this
eventful
day
the
scattered
travelers
began
to
come
slowly
into
camp
attracted
by
the
guns
and
the
smoke
of
the
fire
made
by
those
who
first
found
the
water
some
were
nearly
as
far
gone
as
tom
shannon
was
and
great
caution
had
to
used
in
giving
them
water
on
their
empty
stomach
one
man
named
robinson
became
so
weak
before
he
got
near
camp
that
his
companions
placed
him
on
the
back
of
one
of
the
animals
and
a
man
walked
on
either
side
to
catch
him
if
he
fell
off
when
they
got
within
a
mile
of
the
water
he
insisted
that
he
was
strong
enough
to
take
care
of
himself
and
not
be
watched
every
minute
and
they
relaxed
their
vigilance
he
soon
fell
off
and
when
they
went
to
him
he
refused
to
be
put
back
on
the
animal
again
or
to
walk
any
farther
just
spread
my
blankets
down
said
he
and
i
will
lie
down
and
rest
a
little
and
after
a
while
i
will
come
along
into
camp
so
they
left
him
and
pushed
on
to
water
and
when
they
were
a
little
refreshed
went
back
to
him
with
water
and
to
help
him
to
come
in
but
when
they
came
to
him
they
found
him
dead
he
did
not
seem
to
have
moved
after
he
had
lain
down
he
did
not
seem
so
bad
off
as
shannon
was
when
he
lay
down
and
probably
a
few
swallows
of
water
at
that
time
would
have
saved
his
life
it
seemed
sad
indeed
after
so
much
suffering
and
striving
to
get
along
that
he
should
die
within
a
mile
of
water
that
would
have
saved
his
life
if
he
had
possessed
a
little
more
strength
so
that
the
spark
of
life
could
have
remained
a
little
longer
the
cooling
moisture
from
the
canteen
would
have
revived
it
and
a
little
rest
would
have
placed
him
on
his
feet
again
they
had
no
tools
to
dig
a
grave
not
even
a
knife
for
they
had
left
every
weight
in
camp
so
they
covered
him
closely
in
his
blankets
and
sadly
returned
to
their
friends
they
had
all
along
hoped
that
the
frenchman
who
had
wandered
away
would
come
in
but
he
never
came
there
were
several
water
holes
scattered
around
at
this
point
which
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
sunken
place
in
the
hills
and
quite
large
brush
could
be
obtained
for
fire
and
grass
for
the
oxen
those
who
had
been
good
hunters
and
had
thrown
away
their
rifles
as
useless
burdens
now
began
to
look
at
hills
before
them
and
think
that
game
might
be
found
in
them
as
well
as
water
there
were
only
one
or
two
guns
in
the
whole
party
they
thought
that
this
must
surely
be
the
edge
of
the
great
desert
they
had
crossed
and
only
the
snow
range
before
them
could
be
the
obstacle
that
separated
them
from
los
angeles
one
day
from
here
would
bring
them
to
the
edge
of
the
snow
and
they
debated
as
to
the
best
course
to
pursue
some
of
them
were
fearful
they
could
not
cross
the
snow
with
the
oxen
for
it
seemed
to
be
quite
deep
the
best
place
to
cross
seemed
directly
west
of
them
south
was
a
higher
peak
and
to
the
north
it
was
surely
impassible
there
seemed
to
be
a
faint
sign
of
a
trail
from
this
point
towards
the
lowest
point
in
the
snow
mountains
there
were
some
bones
of
cattle
around
the
springs
which
they
thought
was
an
indication
that
in
years
gone
by
there
had
been
some
traveling
on
this
trail
there
surely
would
be
water
in
the
snow
which
could
be
got
by
melting
it
and
on
the
whole
it
seemed
best
to
make
the
attempt
to
cross
at
the
lowest
place
there
were
no
signs
of
travel
except
the
trail
which
had
not
been
used
in
years
not
signs
of
civilization
except
the
bones
starting
from
the
water
holes
which
showed
no
signs
of
having
been
used
for
several
years
their
next
camp
was
as
they
had
calculated
on
the
edge
of
the
snow
where
they
found
plenty
of
dry
juniper
trees
for
fire
and
of
course
plenty
of
water
here
they
killed
an
ox
and
fed
the
hungry
so
that
they
were
pretty
well
refreshed
this
was
an
elevated
place
and
they
could
look
back
over
the
trail
across
the
desert
for
what
seemed
to
them
a
hundred
miles
and
the
great
dangers
of
their
journey
were
discussed
said
one
of
them
to
tom
shannon
tom
you
killed
the
first
game
we
have
come
across
in
two
months
even
the
buzzards
and
coyotes
knew
better
than
to
go
out
in
into
the
country
where
the
cursed
mormon
saint
sent
us
numbskulls
another
said
that
while
they
had
been
seeking
a
heaven
on
earth
they
had
passed
through
purgatory
or
perhaps
a
worse
place
still
nearer
the
one
from
which
sulphurous
fumes
arise
and
now
they
hoped
that
there
might
be
a
somewhat
more
heavenly
place
beyond
the
snow
one
who
had
been
silent
seemed
awakened
by
inspiration
and
spoke
in
impromptu
lines
somewhat
as
follows
as
he
pointed
out
to
the
dim
distance
yonder
in
mountains
gray
beauty
wealth
and
fame
decay
yonder
the
sands
of
the
desert
yonder
the
salt
of
the
sea
yonder
a
fiery
furnace
yonder
the
bones
of
our
friends
yonder
the
old
and
the
young
lie
scattered
along
the
way
some
even
confessed
the
desperate
thoughts
that
had
come
to
their
minds
when
they
were
choking
and
starving
we
have
mentioned
four
of
the
train
who
had
perished
beside
the
trail
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
one
party
of
eleven
started
out
on
foot
before
the
wagons
were
abandoned
by
the
rest
of
the
party
nothing
was
heard
of
these
for
seven
years
but
long
afterward
nine
skeletons
were
found
at
the
remains
of
a
camp
and
the
other
two
were
afterward
seen
in
the
gold
fields
when
spoken
to
about
this
party
they
burst
into
tears
and
could
not
talk
of
it
so
it
is
known
that
at
least
thirteen
men
perished
in
the
country
which
has
well
been
named
death
valley
people
who
have
always
been
well
fed
and
have
never
suffered
from
thirst
till
every
drop
of
moisture
seemed
gone
from
the
body
so
they
dare
not
open
their
mouth
lest
they
dry
up
and
cease
to
breathe
can
never
understand
nor
is
there
language
to
convey
the
horrors
of
such
a
situation
the
story
of
these
parties
may
seem
like
fairy
fables
but
to
those
who
experienced
it
all
the
strongest
statements
come
far
short
of
the
reality
no
one
could
believe
how
some
men
when
they
are
starving
take
on
the
wild
aspect
of
savage
beasts
and
that
one
could
never
feel
safe
in
their
presence
some
proved
true
and
kind
and
charitable
even
with
death
staring
them
in
the
face
and
never
forgot
their
fellow
men
some
that
seemed
weakest
proved
strongest
in
the
final
struggle
for
existence
early
next
morning
before
the
sun
rose
they
started
to
cross
the
snow
leaving
their
comrade
robinson
behind
rolled
up
in
his
blankets
taking
his
everlasting
sleep
so
far
as
the
troubles
of
this
world
are
concerned
what
the
day
would
bring
forth
very
few
could
have
any
idea
go
on
they
must
and
this
direction
seemed
most
promising
if
the
snow
should
prove
hard
enough
to
hold
up
the
oxen
they
could
probably
cross
before
night
but
if
compelled
to
camp
in
the
snow
it
was
a
doubtful
case
for
them
the
snow
held
them
as
they
advanced
on
it
but
grew
a
little
softer
as
the
sun
got
higher
the
tracks
of
both
men
and
animals
were
stained
with
blood
from
their
feet
when
they
turned
the
summit
they
found
more
timber
and
the
ravine
they
followed
was
so
shaded
that
the
force
of
the
sun
was
broken
and
they
really
did
not
suffer
very
much
from
slumping
through
the
snow
and
so
got
safely
over
not
far
below
the
snow
they
found
a
running
brook
of
clear
sweet
water
with
willows
along
the
banks
and
trees
on
the
hills
the
first
really
good
water
for
a
month
or
two
this
is
the
same
camp
where
rogers
and
his
companion
ate
their
meal
of
quail
hawk
and
crow
a
few
days
before
and
these
travelers
knew
by
the
remains
of
the
little
camp
fire
that
they
were
following
on
the
trail
of
the
two
men
who
had
gone
before
this
place
was
so
great
an
improvement
on
the
camps
of
the
past
that
all
hands
began
to
talk
and
act
more
rational
as
hope
dawned
more
brightly
on
them
those
who
had
guns
branched
off
to
search
for
game
but
found
they
were
too
weak
for
that
kind
of
work
and
had
to
sit
down
very
often
to
rest
when
they
tried
to
run
they
stumbled
down
and
made
very
poor
progress
capt
doty
tom
shannon
and
bill
rude
sat
down
to
rest
on
a
bold
point
above
the
creek
while
there
three
wild
horses
came
along
within
easy
range
and
thinking
they
would
form
better
meat
than
the
oxen
each
man
picked
his
animal
and
all
fired
simultaneously
bringing
them
all
to
the
ground
this
seemed
a
piece
of
glorious
luck
and
all
rushed
in
like
wolves
lifter
a
wounded
animal
it
was
not
very
long
before
each
had
a
chunk
of
meat
in
his
hand
and
many
a
one
did
not
stop
from
eating
because
it
was
not
cooked
such
declared
they
never
ate
anything
so
delicious
in
all
their
lives
before
and
wondered
why
horses
were
not
used
as
food
instead
of
hogs
and
cattle
as
they
satisfied
their
ravenous
appetites
they
ate
more
like
beasts
than
like
men
so
nearly
were
they
starved
and
so
nearly
had
their
starving
condition
made
them
fall
from
their
lofty
estate
as
they
passed
on
down
this
cañon
they
found
it
very
brushy
and
on
the
dry
leaves
under
the
trees
they
saw
signs
of
bear
and
perhaps
other
animals
there
were
some
swampy
places
where
it
was
grassy
and
into
these
the
cattle
rushed
with
great
eagerness
for
the
food
they
had
so
long
suffered
for
some
of
brier
cattle
went
in
and
in
tramping
around
for
food
sank
deep
into
the
mud
and
could
not
be
coaxed
out
again
brier
threw
clubs
at
them
but
they
did
not
seem
inclined
to
pay
much
attention
to
her
attacks
so
she
was
forced
to
go
in
after
them
herself
and
in
so
doing
also
sank
into
the
mud
and
could
not
get
out
without
assistance
all
this
time
her
reverend
husband
sat
outside
on
the
hard
ground
at
a
safe
distance
but
did
not
offer
any
help
probably
if
an
extended
and
learned
lecture
on
the
effects
of
gravitation
would
have
done
any
good
he
would
have
been
ready
with
prompt
and
extended
service
to
one
whom
he
had
promised
to
love
and
cherish
about
this
time
stevens
came
along
and
seeing
the
condition
of
the
unfortunate
woman
at
once
went
to
her
assistance
and
helped
her
to
dry
land
brier
himself
never
made
a
move
nor
said
a
word
stevens
looked
terribly
cross
at
him
and
remarked
to
his
companions
that
if
the
preacher
himself
had
been
the
one
stuck
in
the
mud
he
would
have
been
quite
inclined
to
leave
him
there
for
all
of
helping
him
the
cañon
grew
narrow
as
they
descended
and
the
brush
thicker
so
that
to
follow
the
bed
of
the
stream
was
the
only
way
to
get
along
the
cattle
seemed
to
scent
a
bear
and
stampeded
in
terror
through
the
brush
in
various
directions
all
except
one
which
was
being
led
by
a
rope
they
tried
to
follow
the
animals
in
a
desperate
effort
to
recover
them
and
a
few
blankets
they
had
upon
their
backs
but
could
only
make
slow
progress
tom
shannon
and
two
others
found
a
fresh
bear
track
and
determined
to
follow
it
awhile
in
the
hope
of
having
revenge
on
the
cause
of
their
mishap
with
the
oxen
they
took
their
blankets
and
kept
the
trail
till
night
when
they
camped
but
were
at
so
great
an
elevation
that
a
snowstorm
came
with
six
inches
of
snow
so
they
could
no
longer
follow
the
track
they
were
very
hungry
and
on
the
way
back
came
across
some
wild
cherries
which
had
dried
perfectly
dry
as
they
hung
on
the
bushes
these
they
picked
and
ate
cracking
the
seeds
with
their
teeth
and
declaring
them
to
be
the
best
of
fruit
good
appetites
made
almost
anything
taste
good
then
they
got
back
to
the
creek
next
day
pretty
nearly
starved
and
with
neither
a
bear
nor
runaway
oxen
to
reward
them
for
their
two
hard
work
wood
and
water
were
plenty
but
grass
was
scarce
and
their
ox
had
to
live
on
brush
and
leaves
but
this
was
infinitely
better
than
the
stunted
and
bitter
shrubs
of
the
desert
they
came
out
of
the
brush
at
last
into
the
open
bottom
land
where
the
brook
sank
out
of
sight
in
the
sand
and
sage
brush
appeared
all
about
from
this
on
over
the
elevated
point
which
projected
out
nearly
across
the
valley
their
experience
and
emotions
in
coming
in
sight
of
vast
herds
of
cattle
feeding
on
rolling
grassy
hills
or
reclining
under
great
oak
trees
scattered
over
the
more
level
lands
were
much
the
same
as
came
to
the
author
and
his
party
when
the
same
scene
was
suddenly
opened
to
them
signs
of
civilization
and
of
plenty
so
suddenly
appearing
after
so
many
weeks
of
suffering
and
desolation
was
almost
enough
to
turn
their
heads
and
more
than
one
of
the
pioneers
shed
tears
of
joy
only
a
few
days
before
and
they
could
scarcely
have
believed
it
possible
to
find
a
spot
so
lovely
but
to
hungry
more
than
half
starved
men
points
of
artistic
beauty
and
sober
reflections
over
the
terrors
of
the
past
found
little
place
and
their
first
thought
was
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
hunger
which
were
assuredly
none
the
less
when
they
beheld
the
numerous
fat
cattle
all
around
them
there
was
no
one
to
ask
or
to
buy
from
and
to
kill
and
eat
without
permission
might
be
wrong
and
might
get
them
into
difficulty
but
one
might
as
well
ask
a
starving
wolf
to
get
permission
to
slay
and
eat
when
a
fat
lamb
came
across
his
path
as
to
expect
these
men
to
take
very
much
time
to
hunt
up
owners
when
life
or
death
are
the
questions
that
present
themselves
men
are
not
so
apt
to
discuss
the
right
or
wrong
of
any
matter
tom
shannon
and
a
couple
of
others
did
not
wait
long
at
any
rate
but
crawled
down
the
creek
bed
till
they
were
opposite
a
few
fine
animals
and
then
crept
up
the
bank
very
near
to
them
two
or
three
shots
rang
out
and
as
many
fine
cattle
were
brought
down
the
live
cattle
ran
away
and
the
hungry
men
soon
had
the
field
to
themselves
much
quicker
than
can
be
told
the
men
had
fat
pieces
of
meat
in
their
hands
which
they
devoured
without
cooking
the
men
acted
like
crazy
creatures
at
a
barbacue
each
one
cut
for
himself
with
very
little
respect
for
anyone
the
boldest
got
in
first
and
the
more
retiring
came
in
later
but
all
had
enough
and
gradually
resumed
more
human
actions
and
appearance
they
had
hardly
finished
their
bloody
feast
when
they
saw
a
small
squad
of
men
on
horseback
advancing
toward
them
and
as
they
came
near
it
was
quite
plain
that
they
were
all
armed
in
some
way
all
had
lassoes
at
their
saddles
some
had
blunderbusses
and
nearly
every
one
had
a
or
long
bladed
spanish
knife
as
the
horsemen
drew
near
they
formed
into
something
like
military
order
and
advanced
slowly
and
carefully
it
was
pretty
evident
they
thought
they
were
about
to
encounter
a
band
of
thieving
indians
but
as
they
came
closer
they
recognized
the
strangers
as
americans
and
passed
the
compliments
with
them
in
a
rather
friendly
manner
some
of
the
jayhawkers
had
been
in
the
mexican
war
and
understood
a
few
words
of
spanish
and
by
a
liberal
use
of
signs
were
able
to
communicate
with
the
armed
party
and
tell
them
who
they
were
where
they
were
going
and
the
unfortunate
condition
in
which
they
found
themselves
the
men
did
not
seem
angry
at
losing
so
few
of
their
cattle
and
doubtless
considered
themselves
fortunate
in
not
suffering
to
the
extent
of
some
hundreds
as
they
did
sometimes
by
indian
raids
and
invited
the
whole
party
down
to
the
ranch
house
of
the
san
francisquito
rancho
of
which
this
was
a
part
arrived
at
the
house
the
ranch
men
brought
in
a
good
fat
steer
which
they
killed
and
told
the
poor
americans
to
help
themselves
and
be
welcome
this
was
on
the
fourth
day
of
february
the
whole
party
remained
here
to
rest
themselves
and
their
oxen
for
several
days
and
were
royally
entertained
by
the
people
at
the
ranch
they
talked
over
the
plans
for
the
future
and
considered
the
best
course
to
pursue
they
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
keep
their
oxen
for
these
would
now
improve
in
flesh
and
as
they
had
no
money
with
which
to
buy
food
they
might
still
rely
on
them
in
further
travels
the
best
oxen
had
survived
for
the
failing
ones
were
selected
to
be
killed
when
they
were
forced
to
have
food
the
weaker
of
their
comrades
had
perished
in
the
desert
and
the
remainder
of
the
train
consisted
of
the
strongest
men
and
the
strongest
oxen
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
question
but
that
they
could
all
live
in
this
country
where
grass
and
water
were
both
abundant
and
every
sign
of
more
or
less
wild
game
those
of
the
company
who
had
no
cattle
made
their
way
directly
to
los
angeles
and
from
thence
to
the
coast
from
which
most
of
them
reached
san
francisco
by
sailing
vessel
those
who
had
no
money
were
given
a
passage
on
credit
and
it
is
believed
that
all
such
debts
were
afterwards
honestly
paid
capt
doty
made
a
proposition
to
buy
out
the
oxen
of
some
who
had
only
one
or
two
giving
his
note
for
them
payable
in
san
francisco
or
anywhere
up
north
they
might
chance
to
meet
and
many
of
them
accepted
and
went
to
the
coast
in
this
way
doty
secured
oxen
enough
to
supply
one
for
each
of
those
who
decided
to
go
with
him
they
decided
to
use
them
for
pack
animals
to
carry
their
blankets
and
to
proceed
slowly
toward
the
mines
killing
game
if
possible
and
permitting
their
animals
to
graze
and
improve
in
condition
as
they
moved
there
must
have
been
from
to
forty
people
gathered
at
the
ranch
among
them
was
the
rev
brier
who
seemed
to
want
to
impress
it
on
the
new
california
friends
that
he
was
the
man
of
all
others
to
be
honored
the
ranchman
was
a
good
catholic
and
brier
tried
to
make
him
understand
that
he
also
was
very
devout
he
said
and
repeated
to
him
very
often
me
preacher
but
he
did
not
succeed
very
well
in
impressing
the
good
californian
with
the
dignity
of
his
profession
for
he
could
talk
no
spanish
and
was
not
highly
gifted
in
sign
language
when
they
went
away
they
had
no
way
to
reward
their
good
friends
who
had
been
friends
indeed
to
them
they
could
only
look
their
thanks
and
express
themselves
in
a
very
few
words
of
spanish
said
they
to
the
scantily
clothed
travelers
as
they
set
out
on
their
way
to
the
mines
they
followed
down
the
course
of
the
river
that
flowed
through
the
valley
the
santa
clara
river
and
knew
that
it
would
take
them
to
the
sea
at
last
before
they
reached
the
mission
of
san
buena
ventura
near
the
sea
they
ran
out
of
meat
again
for
they
had
failed
to
find
game
as
they
had
expected
and
capt
asa
haynes
took
the
chances
of
killing
a
spanish
cow
that
looked
nice
and
fat
they
camped
around
the
carcass
and
ate
and
smoked
the
meat
that
was
left
while
thus
engaged
two
horsemen
approached
and
after
taking
a
good
look
at
the
proceedings
galloped
off
again
when
the
party
arrived
at
the
mission
they
were
arrested
and
taken
before
the
alcalde
to
give
an
account
of
their
misdeeds
they
realized
that
they
were
now
in
a
bad
fix
and
either
horn
of
the
dilemma
was
bad
enough
they
could
not
talk
spanish
they
had
no
money
they
had
killed
somebody
cow
they
were
very
hungry
they
might
be
willing
to
pay
but
had
no
way
of
doing
it
they
did
not
want
to
languish
in
jail
and
how
to
get
out
of
it
they
could
not
understand
luck
came
to
them
however
in
the
shape
of
a
man
who
could
speak
both
english
and
spanish
to
whom
they
told
their
story
and
who
repeated
it
to
the
alcalde
telling
him
of
their
misfortunes
and
unfortunate
condition
and
when
that
officer
found
out
all
the
circumstances
he
promptly
released
them
as
he
did
not
consider
them
as
criminals
the
cow
was
probably
worth
no
more
than
ten
dollars
at
santa
barbara
they
found
a
chance
to
trade
off
some
of
their
oxen
for
mares
which
were
not
considered
worth
much
and
managed
the
barter
so
well
that
they
came
out
with
a
horse
apiece
and
a
few
dollars
besides
with
which
to
buy
grub
along
the
road
they
depended
mostly
on
their
guns
for
supplying
them
with
food
they
supposed
they
were
about
three
hundred
miles
from
san
francisco
and
expected
to
meet
with
but
few
people
except
at
the
missions
of
which
they
had
learned
there
were
a
few
along
the
road
at
these
there
was
not
much
to
be
had
except
dried
beef
however
they
managed
to
use
the
guns
with
fair
success
and
at
last
arrived
safely
at
stockton
where
they
sold
some
of
their
horses
for
more
than
double
what
they
cost
and
with
a
small
number
of
horses
they
packed
on
to
the
gold
mines
those
of
the
party
who
went
to
los
angeles
managed
in
one
way
or
another
to
get
through
on
schooners
and
many
of
them
after
a
year
or
two
of
hard
work
made
some
money
and
returned
to
their
homes
in
illinois
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
they
did
not
return
via
death
valley
some
years
afterward
the
members
of
this
party
who
had
returned
to
their
eastern
homes
formed
themselves
into
an
organization
which
they
called
the
jayhawkers
union
appointed
a
chairman
and
secretary
and
each
year
every
one
whose
name
and
residence
could
be
obtained
was
notified
to
be
present
at
some
designated
place
on
the
fourth
day
of
february
which
was
the
date
on
which
they
considered
they
passed
from
impending
death
into
a
richly
promising
life
they
always
had
as
good
a
dinner
as
illinois
could
produce
cooked
by
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
pioneers
and
the
old
tales
were
told
over
again
one
part
of
the
program
was
the
calling
of
the
roll
and
such
reports
and
letters
as
had
come
to
hand
the
following
is
a
list
of
the
members
of
the
party

as
can
be

from

were

many
reports
about

about
this
time
and
these
stories
have
been
magnified
and
told
in
all
sorts
of
ways
since
then
and
parties
have
returned
to
try
to
find
the
great
riches
among
the
jayhawkers
were
two
germans
who
could
speak
but
little
english
and
probably
for
this
reason
kept
apart
from
the
remainder
of
the
party
one
day
after
the
wagons
were
abandoned
these
german
fellows
were
marching
along
alone
with
their
packs
on
their
backs
in
the
warm
sun
suffering
very
much
for
want
of
water
and
food
when
one
of
them
sat
down
on
a
in
pretty
nearly
absolute
despair
while
the
other
man
went
down
into
a
ravine
hoping
to
find
a
puddle
of
water
in
the
rocky
bottom
somewhere
though
it
was
almost
a
forlorn
hope
all
at
once
he
called
out
to
his
partner
on
the
hill
john
come
down
here
and
get
some
of
this
gold
there
is
a
lot
of
it
to
this
poor
john
galler
only
replied
no
i
wo
come
i
do
want
any
gold
but
i
would
like
very
much
to
have
some
water
and
some
bread
and
so
they
left
the
valuable
find
and
slowly
walked
on
pulling
through
at
last
with
the
rest
of
them
and
reaching
los
angeles
the
man
who
found
the
gold
went
to
the
mission
of
san
luis
rey
and
started
a
small
clothing
store
and
some
time
afterward
was
killed
john
galler
settled
in
los
angeles
and
established
a
wagon
shop
in
which
he
did
a
successful
business
he
was
an
honest
industrious
man
and
the
people
had
great
confidence
in
him
he
often
told
them
about
what
his
partner
had
said
about
finding
the
gold
in
the
desert
and
the
people
gave
him
an
outfit
on
two
or
three
occasions
to
go
back
and
the
find
but
he
did
not
seem
to
have
much
idea
of
location
and
when
he
got
back
into
the
desert
again
things
looked
so
different
to
him
that
he
was
not
able
to
identify
the
place
or
to
be
really
certain
they
were
on
the
same
trail
where
his
companion
found
the
gold
the
author
saw
him
in
and
heard
what
he
had
to
say
about
it
and
is
convinced
that
it
was
not
gold
at
all
which
they
saw
i
told
him
that
i
more
than
suspected
that
what
he
saw
was
mica
instead
of
gold
and
that
both
he
and
his
partner
had
been
deceived
for
more
than
one
man
not
used
to
gold
had
been
deceived
before
now
no
sir
said
he
i
saw
lots
of
gold
in
germany
and
when
i
saw
that
i
knew
what
it
was
the
author
went
back
over
that
trail
in
and
sought
out
the
german
on
purpose
to
get
information
about
the
gold
he
could
not
give
the
name
of
a
single
man
who
was
in
the
party
at
that
time
but
insisted
that
it
was
gold
he
saw
and
that
he
knew
the
trail
the
author
was
able
to
identify
with
reasonable
certainty
the
trails
followed
by
the
different
parties
but
found
no
signs
of
gold
formation
except
some
barren
quartz
and
this
after
an
experience
of
several
years
in
both
placer
and
quartz
mines
so
honest
john
galler
famous
placer
mine
still
remains
in
the

which

prospected

alexander
combs
erkson
was
one
of
the
pioneers
of
having
left
the
state
of
iowa
in
the
month
of
may
when
he
assisted
in
organizing
a
company
known
as
the
badger
company
at
kanesville
the
object
being
mutual
assistance
and
protection
this
company
joined
the
bennett
party
mentioned
so
prominently
in
this
history
at
the
missouri
and
traveled
with
them
or
near
them
to
the
rendezvous
near
salt
lake
where
the
new
company
was
organized
for
the
southern
trip
taken
by
the
death
valley
party
the
jayhawkers
and
others
as
the
experience
of
erkson
was
in
some
respects
different
to
that
of
the
parties
mentioned
he
having
taken
a
different
route
for
a
part
of
the
way
it
was
thought
best
to
embody
it
in
this
history
the
following
was
dictated
to
the
editor
of
this
book
and
as
erkson
died
before
the
written
account
could
be
revised
by
him
it
is
the
best
that
can
possibly
be
obtained
erkson
statement
we
arrived
at
the
mormon
camp
near
salt
lake
salt
lake
city
in
the
month
of
august
several
of
us
went
to
work
getting
out
lumber
for
brigham
young
while
we
were
waiting
and
resting
the
mormons
all
advised
us
not
to
undertake
to
go
on
by
the
northern
route
and
as
the
travelers
gathered
at
this
point
they
canvassed
the
situation
we
used
our
teams
when
we
were
at
work
for
brigham
and
assisted
in
building
a
dam
across
a
cañon
where
he
intended
to
build
a
woolen
mill
i
earned
about
a
hundred
dollars
by
my
work
which
was
paid
to
me
in
pieces
of
a
gold
coin
made
by
the
mormons
they
were
not
like
the
coins
i
remember
one
side
had
an
eye
and
the
words
to
the
lord
we
entered
into
an
agreement
with
capt
hunt
a
mormon
to
pilot
us
through
and
turned
all
our
gold
into
that
company
thus
bringing
none
of
the
mormon
gold
with
us
we
went
on
with
the
company
as
has
been
related
in
the
foregoing
pages
till
we
arrived
at
mt
misery
so
named
by
us
when
we
took
the
back
track
while
manley
and
the
others
went
on
as
they
have
related
we
had
meetings
by
the
light
of
a
greenwood
fire
and
the
matter
was
talked
up
in
little
knots
of
people
and
then
some
one
would
get
up
and
speak
one
brier
a
preacher
was
the
principal
blower
are
going
wrong
said
he
we
should
go
west
and
in
six
weeks
we
will
be
loaded
with
gold
hunt
got
a
little
confused
at
a
place
called
beaver
meadows
or
mountain
meadows
and
thought
perhaps
he
could
find
a
new
road
several
men
were
sent
out
to
look
and
some
of
us
in
camp
played
ball
for
amusement
while
we
were
waiting
hunt
men
came
back
and
said
there
were
no
prospects
of
a
new
road
and
he
said
he
knew
the
southern
route
and
believed
it
would
be
safe
to
go
that
way
he
told
us
that
we
must
decide
the
next
day
when
we
came
to
the
road
where
we
were
to
separate
he
filed
off
on
his
road
and
the
others
filed
off
on
their
road
and
then
came
back
with
their
whips
in
their
hands
i
had
filed
in
after
hunt
and
they
tried
to
convince
me
that
i
was
very
wrong
a
norton
of
adrian
promised
erkson
a
horse
to
ride
if
she
would
go
and
so
i
left
hunt
and
turned
in
on
the
other
road
the
hindmost
wagon
this
is
going
back
a
little
with
the
history
and
bringing
it
up
to
mt
misery
on
my
way
back
from
mt
misery
i
climbed
up
on
a
big
rock
and
inscribed
the
date
in
our
journey
we
came
to
what
is
called
rim
of
the
basin
and
traveled
along
on
that
a
distance
till
we
came
to
the
santa
clara
river
and
saw
where
the
indians
had
raised
corn
and
melons
we
followed
on
down
that
stream
and
found
our
teams
gradually
failing
noting
this
we
decided
to
overhaul
our
loads
and
reject
a
lot
of
things
not
strictly
necessary
to
preserve
life
i
know
i
threw
out
a
good
many
valuable
and
pretty
things
by
the
roadside
i
remember
six
volumes
of
ancient
history
nicely
bound
with
my
name
on
the
back
that
were
piled
up
and
left
we
followed
along
near
the
santa
clara
river
till
it
emptied
into
the
virgin
river
it
was
somewhere
along
here
that
we
first
saw
some
yucca
trees
the
boys
often
set
fire
to
them
to
see
them
burn
the
virgin
river
was
a
small
stream
running
on
about
the
course
we
wanted
to
travel
and
we
followed
this
course
for
thirty
or
forty
miles
we
found
plenty
of
wood
and
water
and
mesquite
after
awhile
the
river
turned
off
to
the
left
while
we
wanted
to
keep
to
the
right
so
we
parted
company
there
we
heard
of
a
river
beyond
which
they
called
the
muddy
and
we
went
up
a
little
arroyo
then
over
a
divide
to
some
table
land
that
led
us
down
to
the
big
muddy
we
made
our
wagons
as
light
as
possible
taking
off
all
the
boards
and
stakes
we
could
possibly
get
along
without
wm
philipps
and
others
were
placed
on
short
allowance
they
had
an
idea
that
i
had
more
provisions
in
my
wagon
than
i
ought
to
have
but
i
told
them
that
it
was
clothing
that
we
used
to
sleep
on
i
divided
among
them
once
or
twice
when
we
reached
the
muddy
we
stopped
two
or
three
days
for
there
was
plenty
of
feed
it
was
a
narrow
stream
that
seemed
as
if
it
must
come
from
springs
it
was
narrow
between
banks
but
ran
pretty
deep
and
a
streak
of
fog
marked
its
course
in
the
morning
we
understood
it
was
not
very
far
from
where
we
left
the
virgin
river
to
the
colorado
some
said
not
more
than
fourteen
miles
and
that
the
colorado
turned
sharply
to
the
south
at
that
point
rhynierson
and
wife
had
a
child
born
to
them
on
the
virgin
river
and
it
was
named
virginia
it
was
a
gloomy
trip
the
whole
time
on
the
muddy
i
lost
three
or
four
head
of
cattle
all
within
a
day
and
a
night
erkson
walked
to
lighten
the
load
and
would
pick
all
the
bunches
of
grass
she
saw
and
put
them
on
the
wagon
to
feed
the
oxen
when
we
stopped
i
let
them
pass
me
and
stopped
and
fed
the
cattle
and
slept
ourselves
it
was
said
that
we
ran
great
risks
from
indians
but
we
did
not
see
any
i
had
at
this
time
only
two
yoke
of
oxen
left
we
overtook
the
party
next
morning
at
nine
having
met
some
of
them
who
were
coming
back
after
us
all
were
rejoiced
that
we
had
come
on
safely
here
i
met
elisha
bennett
and
told
him
my
story
he
said
he
could
sell
me
a
yoke
of
oxen
he
had
a
yoke
in
philipps
team
and
was
going
to
take
them
out
he
said
nothing
in
particular
as
to
price
i
said
that
i
wanted
to
see
philipps
and
talk
with
him
about
the
matter
for
he
had
said
bennett
should
not
have
the
cattle
i
went
over
to
see
him
and
spoke
to
him
about
bennett
cattle
and
he
told
me
they
had
quarreled
and
i
could
have
them
and
so
we
made
a
bargain
i
gave
twenty
dollars
for
the
cattle
the
last
money
i
had
and
as
much
provisions
as
he
could
carry
on
his
back
they
were
making
up
a
party
to
reach
the
settlements
at
the
williams
ranch
and
i
made
arrangements
for
them
to
send
back
provisions
for
us
about
thirty
started
that
way
young
men
and
men
with
no
families
with
them
i
got
along
very
well
with
my
new
team
after
that
it
was
about
forty
miles
from
water
to
water
and
i
think
we
camped
three
times
at
one
place
we
found
that
provisions
had
been
left
with
a
notice
that
the
material
was
for
us
but
the
got
the
provisions
we
struck
a
spring
called
a
small
spring
of
water
and
a
child
of
some
of
the
party
died
there
and
was
buried
we
then
went
more
nearly
south
to
find
the
mojave
river
for
we
hoped
to
find
water
there
it
was
very
scarce
with
us
then
we
had
one
pretty
cold
day
but
generally
fine
weather
and
to
get
along
we
traveled
at
night
and
a
party
struck
the
mojave
here
there
was
some
grass
and
the
mustard
was
beginning
to
start
up
and
some
elder
bushes
to
put
forth
leaves
i
picked
some
of
the
mustard
and
chewed
it
to
try
to
get
back
my
natural
taste
here
the
party
divided
a
part
going
to
the
left
to
san
bernardino
and
the
remainder
to
the
right
to
cucamunga
i
was
with
the
latter
party
and
we
got
there
before
night
rhynierson
said
to
one
of
the
party
you
had
better
hurry
on
ahead
and
try
to
get
some
meat
before
the
crowd
comes
up
charlie
went
on
ahead
and
we
drove
along
at
the
regular
gait
which
was
not
very
fast
about
these
times
we
saw
nothing
of
charlie
and
so
i
went
to
the
house
to
look
for
him
and
found
him
dead
drunk
on
wine
he
had
not
said
a
word
to
them
about
provisions
that
wine
wrecked
us
all
all
had
a
little
touch
of
scurvy
and
it
seemed
to
be
just
what
we
craved
i
bought
a
big
tumbler
of
it
for
two
bits
and
carried
it
to
my
wife
she
lasted
it
at
first
rather
gingerly
then
took
a
little
larger
sup
of
it
and
then
put
it
to
her
lips
and
never
slopped
drinking
till
the
last
drop
was
gone
i
looked
a
little
bit
surprised
and
she
looked
at
me
and
innocently
asked
have
you
had
any
i
was
afraid
she
would
be
the
next
one
to
be
dead
drunk
but
it
never
affected
her
in
that
way
at
all
we
bought
a
cow
here
to
kill
and
used
the
meat
either
fresh
or
dried
and
then
went
on
to
the
williams
or
chino
ranch
williams
was
glad
to
see
us
and
said
we
could
have
everything
we
wanted
we
wanted
to
get
wheat
for
we
had
lived
so
long
on
meat
that
we
craved
such
food
he
told
us
about
the
journey
before
us
and
where
we
would
find
places
to
camp
here
we
found
one
of
the
gruwells
we
camped
here
a
week
meeting
many
emigrants
who
came
by
way
of
santa
fe
we
went
on
from
here
to
san
gabriel
where
we
staid
six
weeks
to
rest
and
recuperate
the
cattle
in
the
good
grass
we
found
here
they
all
became
about
as
fat
as
ever
in
a
little
while
here
the
party
all
broke
up
and
no
sort
of
an
organization
was
kept
up
beyond
here
some
went
to
los
angeles
some
went
on
north
trading
off
their
cattle
for
horses
and
some
went
directly
to
the
coast
we
went
to
the
mission
of
san
fernando
where
we
got
some
oranges
which
were
very
good
for
us
there
is
a
long
tedious
hill
there
to
get
over
we
made
up
ten
wagons
by
the
time
we
reached
the
san
francisquito
ranch
i
had
lost
my
cattle
i
went
down
to
this
ranch
and
there
met
and
arcane
getting
ready
to
go
to
san
pedro
we
came
north
by
way
of
tejon
pass
and
the
kern
river
not
far
from
quite
a
large
lake
and
reached
the
mines
at
last
i
remember
we
killed
a
very
fat
bear
and
tried
out
the
grease
and
with
this
grease
and
some
flour
and
dried
apples
erkson
made
some
pretty
good
pies
which
the
miners
were
glad
to
get
at
a
dollar
and
even
two
dollars
apiece
erkson
followed
mining
for
about
a
year
and
then
went
into
other
business
until
he
came
to
santa
clara
valley
and
began
farming
near
alviso
he
has
been
a
highly
respected
citizen
and
progressive
man
he
died
in
san
jose
in
the
spring
of
the
experience
of
edward
coker
edward
coker
was
one
of
a
party
of
men
who
left
their
wagons
being
impatient
of
the
slow
progress
made
by
the
ox
train
and
organized
a
pack
train
in
which
they
were
themselves
the
burden
carriers
they
discarded
everything
not
absolutely
necessary
to
sustain
life
packed
all
their
provisions
into
knapsacks
bravely
shouldered
them
and
started
off
on
foot
from
the
desert
to
reach
california
by
the
shortest
way
among
those
whom
coker
can
recollect
are
capt
nat
ward
jim
woods
jim
martin
of
missouri
john
martin
of
texas
old
francis
a
french
canadian
fred
carr
negro
joe
and
some
others
from
coffeeville
with
others
from
other
states
coker
related
his
experience
to
the
author
somewhat
as
follows
one
other
of
the
party
was
a
colored
man
who
joined
us
at
the
camp
when
we
left
the
families
he
being
the
only
remaining
member
of
a
small
party
who
had
followed
our
wagon
tracks
after
we
had
tried
to
proceed
south
this
party
was
made
up
of
a
culverwell
who
had
formerly
been
a
writer
in
a
government
office
at
washington
a
man
named
fish
claiming
to
be
a
relative
of
hamilton
fish
of
new
york
and
another
man
whose
name
i
never
knew
he
poor
fellow
arrived
at
our
camp
in
a
starving
condition
and
died
before
our
departure
the
other
two
unfortunates
ones
died
on
the
desert
and
the
colored
man
reported
that
he
simply
covered
their
remains
with
their
blankets
i
well
remember
that
last
night
in
camp
before
we
started
with
our
knapsacks
and
left
the
families
for
it
was
plain
the
women
and
children
must
go
very
slow
and
we
felt
we
could
go
over
rougher
and
shorter
roads
on
foot
and
get
through
sooner
by
going
straight
across
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
our
condition
was
certainly
appalling
we
were
without
water
all
on
the
verge
of
starvation
and
the
three
poor
cattle
which
yet
remained
alive
were
objects
of
pity
it
seemed
almost
a
crime
to
kill
the
poor
beasts
so
little
real
food
was
there
left
on
their
skeleton
frames
they
had
been
so
faithful
and
had
plodded
along
when
there
seemed
no
hope
for
them
they
might
still
serve
to
keep
the
party
from
starvation
it
was
at
this
camp
that
ischam
died
the
night
before
our
departure
he
came
wandering
into
camp
and
presented
such
an
awful
appearance
simply
a
living
skeleton
of
a
once
grand
and
powerful
man
he
must
have
suffered
untold
agony
as
he
struggled
on
to
overtake
the
party
starving
and
alone
with
the
knowledge
that
two
of
his
companions
had
perished
miserably
of
starvation
in
that
unknown
wilderness
of
rocks
and
alkali
our
journey
on
foot
through
the
mountains
was
full
of
adventure
and
suffering
on
our
arrival
at
the
shores
of
owen
lake
not
a
man
of
the
party
had
a
mouthful
of
food
left
in
his
pack
and
to
add
to
our
difficulties
we
had
several
encounters
with
the
hostile
indians
there
was
a
fearful
snow
storm
falling
at
owen
lake
on
the
evening
that
we
arrived
there
and
we
could
make
no
fire
the
indians
gathered
around
us
and
we
did
not
know
exactly
what
to
make
of
them
nor
could
we
determine
whether
their
intentions
were
good
or
bad
we
examined
the
lake
and
determined
to
try
to
ford
it
and
thus
set
out
by
the
light
of
the
moon
that
occasionally
peeped
out
from
behind
the
clouds
while
the
red
devils
stood
howling
on
the
shore
the
following
morning
we
found
what
was
then
known
as
the
fremont
trail
and
by
the
advice
of
some
friendly
indians
who
came
into
our
camp
we
kept
the
big
trail
for
three
days
and
came
to
walker
pass
while
on
this
trail
we
were
followed
at
night
by
a
number
of
wild
indians
but
we
prudently
avoided
any
collisions
with
them
and
kept
moving
on
going
on
through
the
pass
we
followed
the
right
hand
branch
of
the
trail
the
left
hand
branch
leading
more
to
the
south
and
across
a
wide
plain
we
soon
came
to
a
stream
now
known
to
be
the
south
fork
of
the
kern
river
which
we
followed
until
we
came
to
its
junction
with
a
larger
river
the
two
making
the
kern
river
here
we
were
taken
across
by
some
friendly
indians
who
left
the
missions
farther
west
during
the
mexican
war
and
took
to
their
own
village
located
at
the
foot
of
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
at
this
village
we
were
on
exhibition
for
several
hours
with
an
audience
of
five
hundred
people
or
more
of
the
red
men
and
on
the
following
morning
we
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
mountains
again
the
indians
furnishing
us
with
a
guide
in
the
person
of
an
old
he
brought
us
over
the
range
through
the
snow
and
over
the
bleak
ridges
in
the
month
of
december
and
we
made
our
first
camp
at
an
indian
village
in
tulare
valley
a
few
miles
south
of
where
porterville
now
stands
from
this
indian
village
we
walked
on
until
we
arrived
at
the
present
site
of
millerton
on
the
south
bank
of
the
san
joaquin
river
our
sufferings
were
terrible
from
hunger
cold
and
wet
for
the
rains
were
almost
continual
at
this
elevation
and
we
had
been
forced
several
times
to
swim
the
sudden
change
from
the
desert
to
a
rainy
region
was
pretty
severe
on
us
on
our
arrival
at
the
san
joaquin
river
we
found
a
camp
of
wealthy
mexicans
who
gave
us
a
small
amount
of
food
and
seemed
to
want
us
to
pass
on
that
they
might
be
rid
of
us
i
can
well
believe
that
a
company
of
starving
men
was
the
cause
of
some
disquietude
to
them
they
gave
us
some
hides
taken
from
some
of
the
cattle
they
had
recently
slain
and
from
these
we
constructed
a
boat
and
ferry
rope
in
which
we
crossed
the
river
and
then
continued
our
journey
to
the
mining
camp
on
aqua
frio
in
mariposa
county
it
is
very
strange
to
think
that
since
that
time
i
have
never
met
a
single
man
of
that
party
of
i
had
kept
quite
full
notes
of
the
whole
trip
from
the
state
of
new
york
to
the
mines
and
including
my
early
mining
experience
up
to
the
year
unfortunately
this
manuscript
was
burned
at
the
russ
house
fire
in
fresno
where
i
also
lost
many
personal
effects
in
the
year
coker
was
living
in
fresno
or
near
that
city
in
fairly
comfortable
health
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
evening
of
his
days
to
which
all
the
old
pioneers
are
rapidly
approaching
may
be
to
him
all
that
his
brightest
hopes
pictured
chapter
xv
having
followed
the
various
little
parties
into
which
the
great
train
had
resolved
itself
when
it
began
to
feel
the
pressure
of
suffering
and
trouble
which
came
with
contact
with
the
desert
followed
them
in
their
various
ways
till
they
came
through
to
the
pacific
slope
the
travels
and
experiences
of
the
author
are
again
resumed
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
had
rested
at
los
angeles
working
for
brier
who
had
temporarily
turned
boarding
house
keeper
and
finally
made
arrangements
with
some
drovers
to
assist
in
taking
a
small
stock
of
horses
north
to
the
mines
his
story
is
thus
continued
we
followed
the
wagon
road
which
the
companies
that
had
gone
on
before
had
made
and
got
along
very
well
at
night
i
acted
independently
staked
out
my
mule
and
ate
my
meal
of
dried
meat
and
crackers
then
joined
the
others
around
a
large
fire
and
all
seemed
to
enjoy
the
company
after
a
few
days
the
two
men
who
owned
the
horses
proposed
to
me
to
let
my
mule
carry
the
provisions
and
they
wanted
me
to
ride
one
of
their
horses
that
was
not
carrying
a
pack
as
they
said
it
would
keep
it
more
gentle
to
ride
it
to
please
the
old
gentleman
from
sacramento
i
agreed
to
the
proposition
for
i
thought
perhaps
by
being
accommodating
i
could
get
along
more
pleasantly
thus
we
traveled
on
over
rolling
hills
covered
with
grass
and
wild
flowers
and
i
was
much
pleased
with
all
that
i
could
see
for
the
first
two
days
we
did
not
pass
a
house
which
shows
how
thinly
settled
the
country
was
cattle
were
often
seen
and
sometimes
horses
but
people
were
very
scarce
in
time
we
went
down
a
long
steep
hill
then
across
a
wide
valley
that
supported
a
rank
growth
of
vegetation
and
came
to
a
mission
called
san
buena
ventura
good
luck
here
the
men
seemed
scarce
but
indians
and
dogs
plenty
the
houses
were
of
the
same
sort
as
at
los
angeles
except
the
church
all
made
of
dried
mud
and
never
more
than
one
story
high
as
we
journeyed
along
we
came
to
the
sea
shore
the
grandest
sight
in
the
world
to
me
for
i
had
never
before
seen
the
ocean
what
a
wide
piece
of
water
it
was
far
out
i
could
see
small
waves
coming
toward
the
shore
and
the
nearer
they
came
the
faster
they
seemed
to
rush
and
at
last
turned
into
great
rollers
and
breakers
which
dashed
upon
the
rocks
or
washed
far
up
the
sandy
shore
with
a
force
that
made
the
ground
tremble
there
was
no
wind
and
i
could
not
see
what
it
could
be
that
so
strangely
agitated
the
water
here
the
waves
kept
coming
one
after
another
with
as
much
regularity
as
the
slow
strokes
of
a
clock
this
was
the
first
puzzle
the
great
sea
propounded
to
me
and
there
under
the
clear
blue
sky
and
soft
air
i
studied
over
the
ceaseless
restless
motion
and
the
great
power
that
was
always
beating
on
the
shore
i
tasted
the
water
and
found
it
exceedingly
salt
and
i
did
not
see
how
anything
could
live
in
it
and
not
become
in
the
condition
of
pickled
pork
or
fish
where
was
the
salt
to
make
this
mighty
brine
pond
and
why
did
it
keep
so
when
the
great
rivers
kept
pouring
in
their
torrents
of
fresh
waters
i
did
not
understand
and
these
are
some
of
the
thoughts
that
came
to
the
boy
who
had
been
raised
upon
the
prairie
and
to
whom
the
great
ocean
was
indeed
an
unknown
sea
we
followed
along
the
road
and
in
time
came
to
another
village
and
mission
called
santa
barbara
the
village
was
near
the
shore
and
the
church
farther
back
upon
an
elevated
piece
of
ground
near
the
foot
of
the
mountain
overlooking
the
town
and
sea
and
much
of
the
country
to
the
south
west
and
east
the
mountain
was
high
and
rough
and
a
point
ran
out
into
the
sea
making
a
sort
of
harbor
this
town
was
built
much
as
the
others
had
been
except
perhaps
the
mission
which
seemed
better
the
roofs
were
as
flat
as
the
floors
and
were
covered
with
a
sort
of
tar
which
made
them
the
material
of
the
houses
was
bricks
two
feet
long
by
one
foot
wide
and
four
to
six
inches
thick
there
was
no
lime
in
the
mortar
of
this
mason
work
and
the
openings
in
the
walls
had
iron
bars
across
them
instead
of
sash
and
glass
dried
hides
were
spread
upon
the
floors
and
there
was
a
large
earthen
jar
for
water
but
not
a
table
bedstead
or
chair
could
be
seen
in
the
rooms
we
saw
a
man
came
along
rode
right
in
at
the
door
turned
around
and
rode
out
again
the
floor
was
so
hard
that
the
horse
feet
made
no
impression
on
it
very
few
men
quite
a
number
of
indians
more
women
and
a
still
larger
quantity
of
dogs
made
up
the
inhabitants
leaving
here
the
road
led
back
from
the
sea
shore
and
over
quite
a
level
table
land
covered
with
a
big
growth
of
grass
and
some
timber
and
then
down
to
the
sandy
shore
again
where
the
mountain
comes
so
close
that
we
were
crowded
down
to
the
very
water
edge
here
the
waves
were
still
following
each
other
to
the
shore
and
dashing
themselves
to
pieces
with
such
a
noise
that
i
felt
awed
to
silence
what
a
strange
difference
in
two
parts
of
the
earth
so
little
distance
from
each
other
here
was
a
waste
of
waters
there
was
a
waste
of
sands
that
may
some
time
have
been
the
bottom
of
just
such
a
dashing
rolling
sea
as
this
and
here
between
the
two
was
a
fertile
region
covered
with
trees
grass
and
flowers
and
watered
with
brooks
of
fresh
sweet
water
paradise
and
desolation
they
surely
were
not
far
apart
here
i
saw
some
of
the
queer
things
that
wash
on
shore
for
we
camped
close
to
the
beach
it
was
a
circumstance
of
great
interest
to
me
to
see
the
sun
slowly
go
down
into
the
great
ocean
slowly
and
steadily
it
went
getting
redder
and
redder
as
it
went
down
then
it
just
touched
the
distant
water
and
the
waves
dashed
over
more
and
more
of
its
face
till
all
was
covered
were
it
not
for
the
strong
bright
rays
that
still
shot
up
across
the
sky
one
might
think
it
was
drowned
forever
but
in
the
morning
it
came
up
over
the
mountain
top
having
apparently
made
half
the
circuit
of
the
globe
soon
after
this
the
road
left
the
shore
and
turned
into
the
mountains
another
mission
was
on
this
road
santa
ynez
situated
in
a
beautiful
place
but
apparently
in
decay
for
the
men
had
gone
to
the
mines
leaving
the
indians
women
and
dogs
as
in
other
places
san
luis
obispo
was
another
mission
similarly
inhabited
but
the
surroundings
did
not
seem
so
pleasant
as
those
we
had
seen
before
although
it
bore
signs
that
considerable
had
been
done
from
here
our
road
bore
still
more
north
and
we
had
a
long
mountain
to
work
over
very
rocky
and
in
some
places
barren
san
miguel
was
a
mission
situated
on
the
bank
of
a
dry
stream
that
evidently
had
seen
plenty
of
water
earlier
in
the
season
the
surrounding
country
was
covered
with
scattering
timber
soledad
was
another
place
where
there
were
some
improvements
located
on
a
small
river
but
nearly
deserted
like
the
other
places
prospects
at
the
gold
mines
were
so
favorable
that
every
man
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
enrich
himself
and
so
they
left
their
families
at
the
missions
and
in
the
towns
and
rushed
off
to
the
mines
nearly
all
of
them
expected
to
return
by
winter
i
think
i
must
stop
right
here
and
tell
about
the
california
carriages
of
which
i
had
seen
several
at
los
angeles
and
at
the
missions
along
our
road
the
first
time
i
saw
one
it
was
a
great
curiosity
i
assure
you
the
wheels
were
cut
off
the
end
of
a
sycamore
log
a
little
over
two
feet
in
diameter
and
each
section
about
a
foot
long
the
axle
was
a
piece
of
wood
eight
inches
square
with
a
tongue
fastened
to
it
long
enough
to
be
used
with
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
the
ends
of
the
axle
were
roughly
rounded
leaving
something
of
a
shoulder
the
wheels
were
retained
in
place
by
a
big
on
the
axle
and
tongue
was
a
strong
frame
of
square
hewed
timbers
answering
for
bed
pieces
and
the
bottom
was
of
tightly
stretched
which
covered
the
whole
frame
tall
stakes
at
each
corner
of
the
frame
held
up
an
awning
in
hot
weather
the
yoke
was
fastened
to
the
horns
of
the
oxen
by
strong
narrow
strips
of
and
the
tongue
was
fastened
to
the
yoke
in
the
same
way
the
driver
was
generally
an
indian
armed
with
a
small
pole
six
or
eight
feet
long
who
marched
on
before
the
oxen
following
after
i
saw
many
a
wagon
like
this
the
platform
well
filled
up
with
women
and
children
and
a
pack
of
dogs
following
along
behind
slowly
rolling
over
the
country
and
this
is
the
way
they
traveled
when
they
went
visiting
friends
who
lived
a
few
miles
in
the
country
sometimes
the
wheels
gave
perfectly
agonizing
shrieks
as
they
revolved
and
when
they
made
so
much
noise
that
their
strong
spanish
nerves
could
stand
it
no
longer
if
there
was
any
green
grass
to
be
found
the
drivers
would
crowd
in
a
quantity
around
the
axle
and
there
was
generally
room
for
a
good
lot
of
it
to
answer
for
a
lubricator
we
passed
on
from
soledad
and
shortly
rose
into
the
table
land
we
had
seen
for
some
time
before
us
from
here
we
could
look
north
for
a
long
way
with
no
hill
or
mountain
in
sight
but
our
road
led
along
on
the
east
side
of
this
treeless
plain
so
thickly
covered
with
grass
that
we
recalled
some
of
the
old
tales
of
the
grassy
plains
we
passed
a
landholder
house
on
the
road
then
crossed
a
range
of
low
mountains
and
came
to
the
mission
of
san
juan
john
situated
near
the
overlooking
a
level
rich
appearing
extent
of
valley
land
with
a
big
vegetable
growth
all
over
it
in
some
places
wild
mustard
which
stood
thickly
and
was
from
four
to
ten
feet
high
i
thought
what
a
splendid
place
it
would
be
for
the
yankees
who
are
fond
of
greens
this
was
the
first
place
since
we
left
los
angeles
where
we
could
buy
any
kind
of
breadstuff
and
we
were
here
enabled
to
get
a
change
of
diet
including
greens
this
seemed
to
be
one
end
or
side
of
another
valley
and
as
we
went
along
it
seemed
to
widen
away
to
the
east
but
our
course
was
to
the
north
and
we
followed
the
road
the
architecture
of
all
the
buildings
except
the
churches
was
all
the
same
being
built
of
the
sun
dried
adobes
or
bricks
made
by
mixing
up
a
clay
mud
with
tough
grass
and
letting
it
get
dry
and
hard
we
saw
the
same
kind
of
roof
material
as
before
a
sort
of
mineral
tar
which
i
supposed
they
must
find
somewhere
about
i
could
imagine
why
the
houses
were
built
in
this
way
for
when
the
jesuit
missionaries
first
came
in
they
found
the
country
occupied
by
indians
who
used
their
arrows
to
good
effect
as
they
were
jealous
of
all
outside
occupation
the
early
settlers
evidently
made
the
walls
of
their
dwellings
thick
and
strong
enough
to
resist
all
kinds
of
weapons
used
by
indians
they
could
not
set
fire
to
them
for
they
were
fire
proof
and
arrow
proof
and
the
hostile
indian
could
dance
on
the
roof
without
being
able
to
get
in
or
do
any
injury
thus
the
poor
indian
was
fairly
beat
and
eventually
became
a
better
indian
the
indians
of
what
is
now
nevada
and
arizona
used
to
come
over
into
these
rich
valleys
and
clandestinely
capture
a
band
of
a
hundred
or
more
head
of
cattle
or
horses
and
make
their
escape
they
were
often
followed
by
the
herders
but
if
they
did
not
overtake
the
thieves
before
they
got
into
the
deep
cañons
of
the
mountains
they
would
usually
turn
back
and
let
them
go
rather
than
be
led
into
ambush
in
some
strange
narrow
place
where
escape
would
be
impossible
and
they
might
be
filled
with
arrows
no
doubt
the
trail
we
had
followed
across
the
plains
where
there
were
so
many
horses
bones
was
one
of
these
trails
along
which
the
thieving
indians
took
their
booty
which
died
upon
the
trip
our
road
from
here
was
near
the
on
the
west
side
of
a
level
grassy
thinly
timbered
valley
and
as
we
advanced
we
noticed
that
the
timber
grew
more
plentiful
and
the
trees
larger
without
much
underbrush
we
also
noticed
that
the
vegetation
was
ranker
and
no
doubt
the
soil
was
very
rich
we
then
came
to
a
point
where
the
mountain
reaches
out
almost
across
the
valley
to
meet
the
mountain
on
the
east
side
here
we
found
a
gravelly
creek
with
but
little
water
but
as
soon
as
we
passed
this
point
we
saw
the
valley
suddenly
widening
out
and
beautiful
groves
of
live
oak
trees
scattered
all
around
the
vegetation
here
was
very
rank
the
mustard
ten
feet
high
in
places
making
it
difficult
to
see
out
of
the
road
this
was
perhaps
the
strongest
contrast
to
the
arid
desert
that
we
had
seen
as
we
went
on
down
the
valley
the
hills
seemed
to
stand
farther
and
farther
back
as
if
to
make
more
room
for
those
who
would
soon
settle
in
this
fertile
place
and
we
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
village
or
pueblo
of
san
jose
joseph
where
we
camped
here
we
learned
that
the
two
owners
of
the
horses
intended
to
go
to
san
francisco
instead
of
sacramento
and
as
we
considered
the
former
place
a
very
poor
one
for
a
penniless
person
to
go
we
concluded
to
break
up
the
company
camp
and
each
do
the
best
he
could
for
himself
for
our
objective
point
was
the
gold
mines
and
the
sooner
we
reached
them
the
better
the
drovers
who
had
been
anxious
to
have
us
go
with
them
and
help
them
now
began
to
talk
about
a
settlement
with
us
as
if
they
had
done
us
great
favors
and
called
on
the
other
fellows
to
help
pay
for
their
board
upon
the
way
when
they
came
to
me
they
said
my
share
would
be
an
ounce
this
struck
me
hard
but
they
said
i
had
ridden
their
horse
all
the
way
and
the
charge
was
very
low
i
told
them
i
had
furnished
the
most
of
the
provisions
i
had
eaten
and
my
mule
had
packed
a
good
load
all
the
way
which
i
considered
worth
as
much
as
the
use
of
the
horse
but
they
refused
to
allow
me
anything
for
the
use
of
the
mule
and
became
very
urgent
in
their
demand
for
money
these
men
were
evidently
of
the
tribe
of
skinflint
who
had
no
souls
or
they
would
not
have
attempted
to
rob
an
almost
penniless
emigrant
in
this
way
of
the
last
few
dollars
he
had
and
all
the
hope
he
had
of
reaching
the
mines
i
did
not
desire
to
give
up
to
such
narrow
principles
as
this
and
hesitated
but
they
were
bound
to
have
the
money
or
make
a
quarrel
and
talked
pretty
loud
of
the
way
they
collected
debts
in
sacramento
so
that
to
avoid
trouble
and
get
out
of
the
clutches
of
such
mean
scoundrels
as
these
i
counted
out
sixteen
dollars
almost
every
cent
i
had
and
reluctantly
gave
them
to
my
enemy
i
immediately
mounted
my
mule
and
without
stopping
to
say
goodbye
rode
off
i
may
have
quoted
a
part
of
the
speech
capt
hunt
made
when
the
party
wanted
to
leave
the
trail
and
take
the
especially
that
part
where
he
alluded
to
their
going
to
h
i
very
much
fear
the
little
piety
my
mother
taught
me
was
badly
strained
on
that
occasion
and
i
thought
of
a
good
many
swear
words
if
i
did
not
say
them
which
i
suppose
is
about
as
bad
i
could
see
how
cunningly
they
had
managed
to
get
me
to
ride
their
horse
that
it
might
serve
as
the
foundation
for
a
claim
on
me
for
about
all
the
money
i
had
in
the
world
i
hitched
my
mule
in
the
edge
of
the
town
and
went
in
to
look
at
the
place
the
houses
were
situated
very
much
as
in
other
places
we
had
come
through
scattered
around
over
much
ground
and
built
low
but
had
a
different
style
of
roof
a
peaked
or
sloping
one
and
covered
with
half
round
tile
two
feet
or
more
long
and
an
inch
thick
one
course
of
these
would
be
laid
with
the
hollow
side
up
and
then
a
course
with
the
hollow
side
down
covering
the
joints
of
the
lower
course
this
allowed
the
air
to
circulate
freely
and
was
proof
against
rain
i
saw
no
flat
roofs
such
as
i
had
seen
down
along
the
coast
i
saw
one
gambling
house
and
about
all
the
men
in
town
were
gathered
there
and
some
women
too
this
was
the
busiest
place
in
town
and
situated
near
the
plaza
this
was
the
largest
town
i
had
yet
been
in
there
seemed
to
be
plenty
of
women
and
lots
of
dogs
but
the
men
were
as
scarce
as
they
had
been
in
any
of
the
towns
gone
to
the
gold
mines
to
make
a
stake
i
took
in
the
sights
pretty
well
and
there
were
a
great
many
new
things
for
me
to
see
and
when
pretty
well
satisfied
concluded
i
would
go
back
to
my
mule
and
camp
in
some
place
just
out
of
town
for
the
night
before
i
reached
my
animal
whom
should
i
meet
but
my
old
traveling
companion
john
rogers
whom
i
thought
to
be
a
hundred
miles
away
by
this
time
we
shook
hands
heartily
and
he
told
me
that
bennett
moody
and
skinner
were
camped
not
far
off
and
he
was
still
with
them
he
wore
a
pair
of
blue
overalls
a
blue
woolen
shirt
and
the
same
little
narrow
rimmed
hat
he
had
worn
so
long
i
observed
too
that
he
was
barefoot
and
told
him
i
had
a
dollar
or
two
which
he
could
take
and
get
some
shoes
he
said
it
was
no
use
for
there
was
not
a
pair
of
shoes
in
the
town
to
buy
and
he
had
not
found
any
material
of
which
he
could
make
himself
a
pair
of
moccasins
i
told
him
how
i
had
been
swindled
coming
up
and
he
was
about
as
angry
as
i
had
been
i
think
if
i
had
known
that
my
friend
john
rogers
had
been
so
near
i
should
have
bidden
the
rascals
an
unceremonious
and
we
would
have
been
able
to
hold
our
own
on
a
claim
for
the
services
of
myself
and
mule
we
went
up
to
the
place
where
our
people
were
camped
perhaps
a
mile
above
town
on
the
bank
of
a
river
nearly
dry
but
where
plenty
of
wood
water
and
grass
were
at
hand
such
a
place
as
we
had
looked
for
in
vain
for
many
a
weary
day
upon
the
desert
this
was
as
far
above
death
valley
as
a
king
above
a
pauper
and
we
hoped
never
to
see
such
a
country
again
in
camp
we
talked
about
moving
on
to
the
mines
rogers
said
he
was
going
to
start
next
day
and
in
answer
to
exclamations
of
surprise
that
he
should
start
off
alone
he
said
that
some
fellows
camped
a
little
way
down
the
river
were
going
to
start
and
he
had
made
arrangements
to
go
with
them
as
the
bennett
party
would
not
go
yet
for
a
week
in
the
morning
he
shook
hands
and
bade
us
and
good
luck
and
started
off
down
the
river
bank
lost
to
us
as
it
proved
for
many
years
the
next
day
as
we
were
all
sitting
on
the
ground
i
felt
a
sort
of
moving
of
the
earth
under
me
and
heard
a
rumbling
sound
that
seemed
very
queer
it
seemed
there
was
a
motion
also
to
the
trees
around
us
we
all
started
and
looked
a
little
frightened
and
skinner
said
he
believed
it
was
an
earthquake
for
he
said
he
could
see
the
motion
in
a
sort
of
wave
it
was
gone
in
half
a
minute
moody
said
how
do
you
like
california
now
i
said
i
thought
this
part
of
it
was
a
pretty
good
place
for
there
was
plenty
of
wood
water
and
grass
and
that
was
better
than
we
had
seen
in
some
places
he
then
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
heard
bennett
story
of
their
sufferings
and
narrow
escape
from
death
and
it
was
the
most
wonderful
story
he
had
ever
heard
he
said
the
idea
of
bennett
walking
over
such
a
country
for
days
was
almost
beyond
belief
for
he
would
not
have
thought
her
able
to
walk
the
distance
he
never
knew
before
how
much
women
could
do
when
they
were
called
to
do
it
and
they
proved
in
emergencies
to
be
as
tough
as
any
body
he
said
if
he
ever
got
back
home
he
should
move
to
give
them
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
men
for
sure
one
day
i
mounted
my
mule
for
a
ride
to
the
eastern
foothills
and
sat
down
on
a
little
incline
and
overlooked
the
valley
a
beautiful
landscape
while
my
mule
cropped
the
rich
grasses
in
a
circle
described
by
the
rope
which
confined
him
i
was
always
a
great
admirer
of
nature
and
as
i
sat
there
alone
i
could
see
miles
on
miles
of
mammoth
mustard
waving
in
the
strong
breeze
which
came
down
over
the
san
francisco
bay
just
visible
to
the
northward
and
on
the
mountain
summits
to
the
west
could
see
tall
timber
reaching
up
into
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
it
was
a
real
contented
comfort
to
be
thus
in
the
midst
of
luxuriance
and
beauty
and
i
enjoyed
it
coming
as
it
did
at
the
end
of
the
long
and
dreary
road
i
had
been
traveling
for
the
past
twelve
months
up
the
platte
across
the
rockies
down
the
green
river
cañons
in
my
canoe
across
the
mountains
to
salt
lake
out
over
the
rim
of
the
basin
and
across
the
desert
guided
only
by
the
fact
that
we
knew
the
pacific
ocean
was
to
the
west
of
us
and
choosing
our
road
as
best
we
could
in
view
of
the
lofty
impassible
mountains
seeing
thirteen
of
our
comrades
lie
down
never
to
rise
again
and
when
hope
and
strength
were
almost
gone
to
suddenly
come
out
into
a
fertile
region
on
the
seventh
of
march
how
i
wished
the
fellows
who
slept
in
death
valley
could
have
seen
this
view
the
change
from
all
that
barrenness
and
desolation
to
this
beautiful
fertile
country
covered
with
wild
flowers
and
luxuriant
live
oaks
was
as
strong
a
contrast
as
one
could
imagine
a
sudden
coming
from
purgatory
to
paradise
in
the
space
of
a
single
hour
i
waked
up
from
my
dreamy
thoughts
mounted
my
mule
and
rode
to
camp
as
i
rode
along
the
nimble
ground
squirrel
with
his
keen
black
eye
would
climb
to
the
top
of
the
high
mustard
stalks
to
get
a
better
view
and
suspicious
of
an
enemy
within
his
almost
undisputed
territory
disappear
in
a
wink
to
his
safe
underground
fortress
fat
cattle
and
horses
would
appear
before
me
a
moment
and
then
with
a
wild
look
and
high
heads
dash
through
the
tall
mustard
out
of
sight
next
day
my
trip
was
toward
the
western
hills
and
before
i
came
to
them
was
confronted
with
an
extensive
stretch
of
chaparral
brush
absolutely
impenetrable
which
i
must
go
around
or
stop
my
progress
in
this
direction
these
thickets
were
a
regular
paradise
for
grizzly
bears
for
within
the
protection
of
this
matted
and
thorny
growth
he
is
as
safe
as
is
the
soldier
in
the
rocky
fort
of
gibraltar
i
soon
found
a
way
around
the
brush
and
rose
high
enough
so
that
a
backward
look
over
the
valley
was
charming
quite
as
much
so
as
the
eastern
side
i
wandered
over
the
grassy
hills
covered
with
great
scattering
oaks
and
came
to
a
grove
of
mammoth
trees
six
feet
or
more
in
diameter
with
tops
reaching
two
hundred
or
three
hundred
feet
toward
the
blue
sky
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
kind
of
cedar
and
were
far
larger
and
taller
than
any
trees
i
had
ever
seen
in
the
forests
of
vermont
michigan
or
wisconsin
and
in
my
long
journey
from
the
east
the
route
had
been
principally
through
a
country
devoid
of
good
timber
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
everything
was
new
and
wonderful
after
satisfying
my
inquiring
mind
i
returned
to
camp
again
and
soon
learned
that
my
newly
discovered
trees
were
the
famous
redwoods
so
greatly
prized
for
their
valuable
qualities
taking
the
most
direct
course
to
camp
i
came
when
within
two
or
three
miles
of
san
jose
to
a
large
extent
of
willows
so
thick
and
so
thickly
woven
together
with
wild
blackberry
vines
wild
roses
and
other
thorny
plants
that
it
appeared
at
first
as
if
i
never
could
get
through
but
i
found
a
winding
trail
made
by
the
cattle
through
the
bushes
and
mustard
and
this
i
followed
being
nearly
scared
occasionally
by
some
wild
steers
as
they
rushed
off
through
the
thickets
i
got
through
safely
though
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
escape
a
wild
enraged
steer
or
a
grizzly
had
i
met
him
face
to
face
even
with
a
rifle
in
hand
i
could
see
nowhere
but
by
looking
straight
up
for
the
willows
were
in
places
fifty
feet
high
and
a
foot
in
diameter
the
willows
where
i
came
from
were
mere
bushes
and
these
astonished
me
this
bit
of
brush
is
still
locally
known
as
the
willows
but
the
trees
are
all
gone
and
the
ground
thickly
covered
with
orchards
and
fine
residences
the
land
selling
at
from
one
thousand
to
two
thousand
dollars
per
acre
the
sun
rose
without
a
cloud
and
a
little
later
the
sea
breeze
from
the
bay
blew
gently
over
the
valley
making
the
climate
perfectly
delightful
in
its
temperate
coolness
a
true
paradise
on
earth
it
seemed
to
me
if
i
was
able
to
judge
or
set
a
value
upon
so
beautiful
a
spot
and
surely
i
had
seen
all
sorts
good
and
poor
desert
and
valley
mountain
and
plain
but
i
was
poor
in
purse
and
resolved
i
would
seek
first
the
gold
mines
and
secure
gold
enough
to
buy
a
piece
of
this
valley
afterward
when
i
had
seen
what
was
to
be
seen
about
san
jose
i
had
a
talk
with
my
friends
and
found
that
bennett
favored
going
on
to
the
mines
at
once
and
that
moody
and
skinner
thought
they
would
remain
a
little
while
at
least
i
went
along
in
company
with
bennett
and
when
we
got
a
little
way
from
san
jose
on
the
road
to
the
mission
the
road
seemed
walled
in
on
both
sides
with
growing
mustard
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
and
all
in
blossom
how
so
much
mustard
could
grow
and
grow
so
large
i
could
not
understand
i
had
seen
a
few
plants
in
the
gardens
or
fields
which
people
used
for
greens
and
here
seemed
to
be
enough
to
feed
the
nation
if
they
liked
mustard
greens
the
second
day
out
we
passed
the
big
church
at
mission
san
jose
and
soon
left
the
valley
and
turned
into
the
mountains
and
when
part
way
over
we
came
to
a
stream
which
we
followed
up
and
came
out
into
livermore
valley
where
we
found
a
road
to
follow
houses
were
scarce
and
we
camped
a
mile
or
so
before
we
got
to
the
livermore
ranch
buildings
there
was
very
little
sign
of
life
about
the
place
and
we
soon
went
out
of
the
valley
and
into
the
mountains
again
the
first
sign
of
settlement
we
saw
when
part
way
through
the
mountains
was
a
stone
corral
but
no
house
or
other
improvements
the
next
place
was
a
small
house
made
of
willow
poles
set
in
the
ground
and
plastered
over
with
mud
this
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
mountain
house
this
wayside
inn
looked
like
a
horse
thief
glory
only
one
or
two
men
a
quarter
of
an
elk
hanging
on
a
pole
and
no
accommodations
for
man
or
beast
there
was
very
little
water
nothing
to
sell
as
well
as
nothing
wanted
on
the
summits
of
the
mountains
as
we
passed
through
we
saw
standing
like
guards
many
large
buck
elks
it
was
now
fifteen
miles
to
the
san
joaquin
river
and
a
level
plain
lay
before
us
when
our
road
turned
into
the
river
bottom
we
found
the
water
too
deep
to
get
through
safely
so
we
concluded
to
go
on
and
try
to
find
some
place
where
we
could
cross
on
our
way
droves
of
antelopes
could
be
seen
frolicking
over
the
broad
plains
while
in
the
distance
were
herds
of
elk
winding
their
way
from
the
mountains
towards
the
river
for
water
when
far
away
their
horns
were
the
first
things
visible
and
they
much
resembled
the
dry
tops
of
dead
pine
trees
but
a
nearer
view
showed
them
to
us
as
the
proud
monarchs
of
the
plain
when
we
came
up
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
merced
river
we
concluded
to
try
again
to
cross
the
river
here
as
below
was
out
of
its
banks
and
the
overflowed
part
was
quite
wide
which
we
had
to
pass
through
before
we
could
reach
the
river
proper
i
waded
in
ahead
of
the
team
and
sounded
the
depth
of
the
river
so
as
not
to
get
in
too
deep
water
and
avoid
if
possible
such
accidents
as
might
otherwise
occur
sometimes
the
water
was
up
to
the
wagon
bed
and
it
looked
a
little
doubtful
of
our
getting
through
in
safety
but
we
made
it
at
last
we
found
a
narrow
strip
of
dry
land
along
the
river
bank
a
town
was
on
the
east
side
of
the
san
joaquin
river
just
below
where
the
merced
river
came
in
i
think
this
place
was
called
merced
city
this
city
contained
but
one
residence
a
tent
occupied
by
the
ferryman
we
crossed
the
sluggish
stream
and
for
the
privilege
paid
the
ferryman
ten
dollars
for
toll
the
road
was
not
much
used
and
the
ferry
business
seemed
lonesome
here
we
camped
for
the
night
the
mosquitoes
soon
found
us
and
they
were
all
very
hungry
and
had
good
teeth
they
annoyed
me
so
that
i
moved
my
lodgings
to
the
ferryboat
but
here
they
quickly
found
me
and
troubled
me
all
night
these
insects
were
the
first
i
had
seen
since
i
left
the
lower
platte
river
and
i
thought
them
as
bad
as
on
the
mississippi
from
here
the
road
led
up
the
merced
river
near
the
bottom
and
as
we
came
near
groves
of
willows
big
stately
elk
would
start
out
and
trot
off
proudly
into
the
open
plains
to
avoid
danger
these
proud
monarchs
of
the
plains
could
be
seen
in
bunches
scattered
over
the
broad
meadows
as
well
as
an
equal
amount
of
antelope
they
all
seemed
to
fear
us
which
was
wise
on
their
part
and
kept
out
of
rifle
shot
as
were
not
starving
as
we
were
once
i
did
not
follow
them
out
on
the
open
plain
for
i
thought
i
could
get
meat
when
we
were
more
in
need
we
followed
up
the
river
bottom
and
saw
not
a
single
house
until
we
reached
the
road
leading
from
stockton
to
the
mariposa
mines
where
we
found
a
ferry
and
a
small
store
here
we
learned
that
some
men
were
mining
a
few
miles
up
the
river
so
we
drove
on
until
we
found
a
little
work
being
done
in
a
dry
gulch
near
the
river
bank
we
made
our
camp
at
this
spot
and
had
plenty
of
wood
water
and
grass
we
found
there
was
something
to
be
learned
in
the
art
of
gold
mining
we
had
no
tools
nor
money
and
had
never
seen
a
speck
of
native
gold
and
did
not
know
how
to
separate
it
from
the
dirt
nor
where
to
search
for
it
we
were
poor
ignorant
emigrants
there
were
two
or
three
men
camped
here
one
of
them
was
more
social
than
the
rest
and
we
soon
got
acquainted
his
name
was
williams
from
missouri
he
came
down
to
the
river
with
a
pan
of
dirt
and
seeing
me
in
my
ignorance
trying
to
wash
some
as
well
he
took
the
pan
from
me
and
very
kindly
showed
me
how
to
work
so
as
to
let
the
dirt
go
and
save
the
gold
when
he
had
the
pan
finished
a
few
small
bright
scales
remained
these
to
me
were
curious
little
follows
and
i
examined
them
closely
and
concluded
there
was
a
vast
difference
between
gold
and
lead
mining
williams
became
more
friendly
and
we
told
him
something
about
our
journey
across
the
plains
and
he
seemed
to
think
that
we
deserved
a
good
claim
he
went
to
a
dry
gulch
where
a
spaniard
was
working
and
told
him
that
all
of
california
now
that
the
war
was
over
belonged
to
americans
and
he
must
leave
williams
had
his
gun
in
his
hand
and
war
might
follow
so
spaniard
left
and
his
claim
was
presented
to
bennett
and
myself
williams
had
been
twice
to
santa
fe
from
missouri
and
had
learned
the
spanish
language
and
could
swear
at
them
by
note
if
necessary
we
now
began
work
almost
without
tools
but
our
ground
we
had
to
work
was
quite
shallow
and
williams
helped
us
out
by
loaning
us
some
of
his
tools
at
times
we
soon
succeeded
in
scratching
together
some
of
the
yellow
stuff
and
i
went
down
to
the
store
and
bought
a
pan
for
five
dollars
a
shovel
for
ten
dollars
and
a
poor
pick
cost
me
ten
dollars
more
this
took
about
two
ounces
of
my
money
we
now
worked
harder
than
ever
for
about
three
weeks
but
we
could
not
save
much
and
pay
such
high
prices
as
were
charged
our
gulch
claim
was
soon
worked
out
and
as
the
river
had
fallen
some
we
tried
the
bar
but
we
could
only
make
four
or
five
dollars
a
day
and
the
gold
was
very
fine
and
hard
to
save
we
bought
a
hind
quarter
of
an
elk
and
hung
it
up
in
a
tree
and
it
kept
fresh
till
all
of
it
was
eaten
some
others
came
and
took
up
claims
on
the
bar
and
as
the
prospects
were
not
as
good
as
was
wished
three
of
us
concluded
to
go
and
try
to
find
a
better
place
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
all
lay
in
bed
late
before
i
rose
i
felt
something
crawling
on
my
breast
and
when
i
looked
i
found
it
to
be
an
insect
slow
in
motion
resembling
a
louse
but
larger
he
was
a
new
emigrant
to
me
and
i
wondered
what
he
was
i
now
took
off
my
pants
and
found
many
of
his
kind
in
the
seams
i
murdered
all
i
could
find
and
when
i
got
up
i
told
williams
what
i
had
found
he
said
they
hurt
nobody
and
were
called
more
commonly
known
as
body
lice
we
started
on
our
prospecting
tour
and
went
northeast
to
a
place
now
called
big
oak
flat
this
was
at
the
head
of
a
small
stream
and
there
were
several
small
gulches
that
emptied
into
it
that
paid
well
this
flat
was
all
taken
up
and
a
ditch
was
cut
through
to
drain
it
a
ship
load
of
gold
was
expected
to
be
found
when
it
was
worked
a
small
town
of
tents
had
been
pitched
on
both
sides
of
the
flat
one
side
was
occupied
by
gamblers
and
many
games
were
constantly
carried
on
and
were
well
patronized
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
flat
were
many
small
tents
and
around
on
the
hillside
some
mules
and
jacks
were
feeding
one
of
the
little
donkeys
came
down
among
the
tents
and
went
in
one
and
commenced
eating
flour
from
the
sack
the
owner
of
the
flour
ran
to
the
tent
took
his
shot
gun
and
fired
a
load
of
into
the
hams
the
animal
reeled
and
seemed
shot
fatally
i
now
looked
for
a
battle
to
commence
but
the
parties
were
more
reasonable
the
price
of
the
animal
was
fully
paid
and
no
blood
shed
as
i
expected
there
surely
would
be
we
now
prospected
further
east
but
nothing
good
enough
was
found
the
place
we
looked
over
was
where
the
town
of
garota
now
stands
we
concluded
to
go
back
have
a
council
and
go
somewhere
else
on
our
way
back
we
stopped
to
get
dinner
while
i
was
around
the
fire
barefooted
i
felt
something
crawl
up
my
instep
and
it
proved
to
be
another
of
those
of
williams
i
now
thought
these
torments
must
be
all
over
this
country
gold
dust
was
used
to
transact
all
business
all
the
coin
was
in
the
hands
of
the
gentlemen
gamblers
most
miners
found
it
necessary
to
have
a
small
pair
of
scales
in
the
breast
pocket
to
weigh
the
dust
so
as
not
to
have
to
trust
some
one
who
carried
lead
weights
and
often
got
more
than
his
just
dues
gold
dust
was
valued
at
sixteen
dollars
an
ounce
we
now
thought
it
would
be
best
for
two
of
us
to
take
our
mules
and
go
down
in
the
small
hills
and
try
to
get
some
elk
meat
to
take
with
us
as
our
route
would
be
mostly
through
the
unsettled
part
of
the
country
and
no
provisions
could
likely
be
procured
so
bradford
of
new
orleans
and
myself
took
our
mules
and
went
down
where
the
hills
were
low
and
the
game
plenty
we
camped
in
a
low
ravine
staked
out
our
mules
and
staid
all
night
without
a
fire
believing
that
when
we
woke
in
the
early
morning
some
of
the
many
herd
of
elk
then
in
sight
would
be
near
us
at
daylight
and
we
could
easily
kill
all
we
wanted
without
leaving
camp
but
we
were
disappointed
hundreds
of
the
fellows
were
in
sight
but
none
in
rifle
shot
and
there
was
no
chance
for
us
to
get
any
nearer
to
them
we
got
near
a
couple
of
antelope
and
bradford
who
was
a
brag
shot
and
had
the
best
gun
proposed
to
kill
them
as
we
stood
the
larger
of
the
two
was
on
his
side
and
much
nearer
than
the
smaller
one
but
we
fired
together
just
as
we
stood
bradford
antelope
ran
off
unhurt
mine
fell
dead
in
its
tracks
bradford
bragged
no
more
about
his
fine
gun
and
superior
marksmanship
we
went
back
to
camp
with
the
little
we
had
killed
and
soon
got
ready
to
start
north
bennett
was
to
go
with
his
team
to
sacramento
and
wait
there
until
he
heard
from
us
four
of
us
mounted
on
mules
now
started
on
our
journey
along
the
foothills
without
a
road
we
struck
the
tuolumne
river
at
a
ferry
the
stream
was
high
and
rapid
and
could
not
be
forded
so
we
had
to
patronize
the
ferryman
and
give
him
half
an
ounce
apiece
we
thought
such
charges
on
poor
and
almost
penniless
emigrants
were
unjust
the
point
we
were
seeking
to
reach
was
a
new
discovery
called
gold
lake
on
feather
river
where
many
rich
gulches
that
emptied
into
it
had
been
worked
and
the
lake
was
believed
to
have
at
least
a
ship
load
of
gold
in
it
it
was
located
high
in
the
mountains
and
could
be
easily
drained
and
a
fortune
soon
obtained
if
we
got
there
in
time
and
said
nothing
to
anyone
we
might
meet
on
the
road
we
might
succeed
in
getting
a
claim
before
they
were
all
taken
up
we
followed
along
the
foothills
without
a
road
and
when
we
came
to
the
stanislaus
river
we
had
to
patronize
a
ferry
and
pay
half
an
ounce
each
again
we
thought
their
scale
weights
were
rather
heavy
and
their
ferrymen
well
paid
we
continued
along
the
foothills
without
any
trail
until
we
struck
the
road
from
sacramento
to
hangtown
this
sounded
like
a
bad
name
for
a
good
village
but
we
found
it
was
fittingly
named
after
some
ugly
devils
who
were
hanged
there
the
first
house
that
we
came
to
on
this
road
was
the
mormon
tavern
here
were
some
men
playing
cards
for
money
and
two
boys
twelve
or
fourteen
years
old
playing
poker
for
the
same
and
trying
in
every
way
to
ape
the
older
gamblers
and
bet
their
money
as
freely
and
swear
as
loud
as
the
old
sports
all
i
saw
was
new
and
strange
to
me
and
became
indelibly
fixed
on
my
mind
i
had
never
before
seen
such
wicked
boys
and
the
men
paid
no
attention
to
these
fast
american
boys
i
began
to
wonder
if
all
the
people
in
california
were
like
these
bad
and
wicked
here
we
learned
that
gold
lake
was
not
as
rich
as
reported
so
we
concluded
to
take
the
road
and
go
to
coloma
the
place
where
gold
was
first
found
on
the
american
river
we
camped
at
coloma
all
night
bradford
got
his
mule
shod
and
paid
sixteen
dollars
or
in
the
mining
phrase
an
ounce
of
gold
dust
i
visited
the
small
town
and
found
that
the
only
lively
business
place
in
it
was
a
large
gambling
house
and
i
saw
money
gold
dust
liberally
used
sometimes
hundreds
of
dollars
bet
on
a
single
card
when
a
few
hundred
or
thousand
were
lost
more
would
be
brought
on
the
purse
would
be
set
in
the
center
of
the
table
and
the
owners
would
take
perhaps
twenty
silver
dollars
or
checks
and
when
they
were
lost
the
deposited
purse
would
be
handed
to
the
barkeeper
the
amount
weighed
out
and
the
purse
returned
when
the
purse
was
empty
a
friend
of
the
better
would
bring
another
and
so
the
game
went
on
almost
in
silence
the
game
called
monte
seemed
to
be
the
favorite
how
long
these
sacks
of
gold
lasted
or
who
eventually
got
the
whole
i
never
knew
this
was
a
new
country
with
new
people
and
many
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
a
business
that
was
new
strange
and
hazardous
the
final
result
of
all
this
was
what
puzzled
me
we
now
followed
the
road
up
the
mountain
to
georgetown
here
was
a
small
village
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
and
it
seemed
to
be
in
a
prosperous
mining
section
after
some
inquiry
about
a
good
place
to
work
we
concluded
to
go
down
a
couple
of
miles
northeast
of
town
on
cañon
creek
and
go
to
work
if
vacant
ground
could
be
found
there
was
a
piece
of
creek
bottom
here
that
had
not
been
much
worked
georgia
flat
above
had
been
worked
and
paid
well
and
the
illinois
and
oregon
cañons
that
emptied
into
the
bottom
here
were
rich
so
we
concluded
to
locate
in
the
bottom
claims
here
in
the
flat
were
only
fifteen
feet
square
i
located
one
and
my
notice
told
others
that
i
would
go
to
work
on
it
as
soon
my
partner
came
from
sacramento
i
sent
my
partner
bennett
a
note
telling
him
to
come
up
while
waiting
for
bennett
i
took
my
pan
and
butcher
knife
and
went
into
a
dry
gulch
out
of
sight
of
the
other
campers
and
began
work
as
the
ground
was
mostly
bare
bed
rock
by
scratching
around
i
succeeded
in
getting
three
or
four
pans
of
dirt
a
day
the
few
days
i
had
to
wait
for
bennett
i
made
eight
dollars
a
day
until
my
claim
was
worked
out
i
then
went
to
georgetown
to
meet
bennett
and
family
and
soon
after
my
arrival
they
came
well
and
safe
all
of
them
even
to
the
faithful
camp
dog
cuff
were
glad
to
see
me
old
cuff
followed
me
all
around
town
but
when
we
got
ready
to
start
for
camp
the
dog
was
gone
and
could
not
be
found
some
one
had
hidden
him
away
knowing
he
could
not
be
gotten
any
other
way
for
six
ounces
would
not
have
bought
him
we
had
raised
him
in
wisconsin
made
him
a
good
deer
dog
and
with
us
he
had
crossed
the
dry
and
sandy
deserts
he
had
been
a
great
protection
to
children
on
the
plains
and
company
for
us
all
we
now
located
claims
on
the
creek
bottom
the
channel
of
the
creek
was
claimed
by
holman
of
alabama
and
the
helms
brothers
of
missouri
they
had
turned
the
stream
into
a
ditch
in
order
to
work
the
bed
of
the
stream
believing
that
their
claims
had
all
the
gold
in
them
our
claims
joined
theirs
stockton
who
left
his
family
in
los
angeles
came
with
bennett
and
went
to
work
with
us
as
everything
here
was
very
high
we
concluded
to
let
stockton
take
the
team
and
go
to
sacramento
for
provisions
for
our
own
use
flour
and
meat
were
each
fifty
cents
a
pound
potatoes
cents
a
pound
and
onions
one
dollar
and
cents
each
onions
and
potatoes
eaten
raw
were
considered
very
necessary
to
prevent
and
cure
scurvy
which
was
quite
a
common
complaint
whiskey
if
not
watered
cost
one
dollar
a
drink
our
claims
were
about
ten
feet
deep
the
bottom
was
wet
and
a
pump
needed
so
we
went
to
a
whip
and
got
four
narrow
strips
one
by
three
and
one
by
five
and
twelve
feet
long
paying
for
them
by
weight
the
price
being
twelve
cents
a
pound
out
of
these
strips
we
made
a
good
pump
by
fixing
a
valve
at
the
end
and
nailing
a
piece
of
green
rawhide
on
a
pole
which
answered
for
a
plunger
and
with
the
pump
set
at
degrees
it
worked
easily
and
well
one
man
could
easily
keep
the
water
out
and
we
made
fair
wages
in
the
creek
bottom
bush
of
missouri
had
a
saloon
the
building
was
made
mainly
of
brush
with
a
split
piece
for
a
counter
and
another
one
for
a
shelf
for
his
whiskey
keg
a
box
of
cigars
a
few
decks
of
cards
and
half
a
dozen
glasses
which
made
up
the
entire
stock
of
trade
for
the
shop
in
front
was
a
table
made
of
two
puncheons
with
a
blanket
thrown
over
all
and
a
few
rough
seats
around
there
was
no
roof
except
the
brush
and
through
the
dry
season
none
was
needed
except
for
shade
there
was
also
at
this
place
five
brothers
by
the
name
of
helms
also
from
missouri
their
names
were
jim
davenport
wade
chet
and
daunt
these
men
with
holman
owned
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
their
ground
proved
to
be
quite
wet
and
disagreeable
to
work
holman
could
not
well
stand
to
work
in
the
cold
water
so
he
asked
the
privilege
of
putting
in
a
hired
man
in
his
place
which
was
agreed
to
he
then
took
up
a
claim
for
himself
outside
of
the
other
claims
and
this
proved
to
be
on
higher
bed
rock
and
dry
and
paid
even
better
than
the
low
claims
where
the
helms
brothers
were
at
work
this
was
not
what
the
helms
boys
considered
exactly
fair
as
holman
seemed
to
be
getting
rich
the
fastest
and
as
there
was
no
law
to
govern
them
they
held
a
free
country
court
of
their
own
and
decided
the
case
to
suit
themselves
so
they
ordered
holman
to
come
back
and
do
his
own
work
no
fault
was
found
with
the
hired
man
but
what
he
did
his
work
well
enough
but
they
were
jealous
and
would
not
be
bound
by
their
agreement
but
this
decision
did
not
satisfy
all
parties
and
it
was
agreed
to
submit
the
case
to
three
men
and
i
was
chosen
one
of
them
we
held
court
on
the
ground
and
heard
both
sides
of
the
story
after
which
we
retired
to
the
shade
of
a
bunch
of
willows
to
hold
council
over
the
matter
with
the
result
that
we
soon
came
to
a
decision
in
favor
of
holman
about
this
time
one
of
the
helms
boys
began
to
quarrel
with
holman
and
grew
terribly
mad
swearing
all
kinds
of
vengeance
and
making
the
cañon
ring
with
the
loudest
kind
of
missouri
oaths
finally
he
picked
up
a
rock
to
kill
holman
but
the
latter
was
quick
with
his
pistol
a
single
shot
duelling
piece
and
as
they
were
not
more
than
ten
feet
apart
helms
would
have
had
a
hole
in
him
large
enough
for
daylight
to
shine
through
if
the
pistol
had
not
missed
fire
we
stopped
the
quarrel
and
made
known
our
decision
whereupon
helms
went
off
muttering
vengeance
we
now
went
back
to
our
work
again
at
our
claims
mine
being
between
helms
cabin
and
the
saloon
holman
stopped
to
talk
a
little
while
on
my
claim
while
i
was
down
below
at
work
and
soon
helms
came
back
again
in
a
terrible
rage
stopping
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hole
from
holman
swearing
long
and
loud
and
flourishing
a
big
pistol
with
which
he
threatened
to
blow
holman
into
purgatory
he
was
so
much
enraged
that
he
fairly
frothed
at
the
mouth
like
a
rabid
dog
the
men
were
about
twenty
feet
apart
and
i
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
ten
feet
below
but
exactly
between
them
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
in
some
little
danger
for
helms
had
his
big
pistol
at
full
cock
and
as
it
pointed
at
me
quite
as
often
as
it
did
at
anybody
i
expect
i
dodged
around
a
little
to
keep
out
of
range
helms
was
terribly
nervous
and
trembled
as
he
cursed
but
holman
was
cool
and
drew
his
weapon
deliberately
daring
helms
to
raise
his
hand
or
he
would
kill
him
on
the
instant
helms
now
began
to
back
off
but
carefully
kept
his
eye
on
holman
and
continued
his
abuse
as
he
went
on
to
the
saloon
to
get
something
to
replenish
his
courage
holman
during
the
whole
affair
talked
very
calmly
and
put
considerable
emphasis
into
his
words
when
he
dared
helms
to
make
a
hostile
motion
he
was
a
true
alabamian
and
could
be
neither
scared
nor
driven
he
soon
sold
out
however
and
went
to
a
more
congenial
camp
for
he
said
these
people
were
cowardly
enough
to
waylay
and
kill
him
unawares
soon
after
this
unpleasantness
a
man
and
wife
who
lived
in
georgetown
came
into
notice
and
while
the
man
made
some
money
mining
his
wife
did
a
good
stroke
of
business
washing
for
the
boys
who
paid
her
a
dollar
a
shirt
as
laundry
fees
as
she
began
to
make
considerable
money
the
bigger
if
not
better
half
of
this
couple
began
to
feel
quite
rich
and
went
off
on
a
drunk
and
when
his
own
money
was
spent
he
went
to
his
wife
for
more
but
she
refused
him
and
he
in
his
drunken
rage
picked
up
a
gun
near
by
and
shot
her
dead
all
of
a
sudden
the
helms
boys
and
others
gathered
at
the
saloon
took
drinks
all
around
and
did
a
good
deal
of
swearing
which
was
the
biggest
portion
of
the
proceedings
of
the
meeting
and
then
they
all
started
off
toward
town
swearing
and
yelling
as
they
struggled
up
the
steep
mountain
side
a
pack
of
reckless
missourians
who
seemed
to
smell
something
bloody
it
was
near
night
when
they
all
came
back
and
gathered
around
the
saloon
again
they
were
all
in
unusual
good
humor
as
they
related
the
adventures
of
the
afternoon
and
bragged
of
their
bravery
and
skill
in
performing
the
little
job
they
had
just
completed
which
consisted
in
taking
the
murderer
out
to
the
first
convenient
oak
tree
and
with
the
assistance
of
some
sailors
in
handling
the
ropes
hoisting
the
fellow
from
the
ground
with
a
noose
around
his
neck
and
to
the
heave
yo
heave
of
the
sailor
boys
pulling
the
rope
that
had
been
passed
over
an
elevated
limb
they
watched
the
suspended
body
till
the
last
spark
of
life
went
out
and
then
went
back
to
town
leaving
the
corpse
hanging
for
somebody
else
to
cut
down
and
bury
they
whooped
and
yelled
at
the
top
of
their
voices
as
they
came
down
along
the
mountain
trail
and
at
the
saloon
they
related
to
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
there
how
they
had
helped
to
hang
the
who
had
killed
his
wife
they
said
justice
must
be
done
if
there
was
no
law
and
that
no
man
could
kill
a
woman
and
live
in
california
they
imagined
they
were
very
important
individuals
and
veritable
lords
of
creation
these
miners
many
of
them
were
inveterate
gamblers
and
played
every
night
till
near
with
no
roof
over
them
and
their
only
clothes
a
woolen
shirt
and
overalls
which
must
have
been
a
little
scanty
in
the
cool
nights
which
settled
down
over
the
mountain
camp
but
they
bore
it
all
in
their
great
desire
for
card
playing
near
by
there
were
three
men
who
worked
and
slept
together
every
night
dividing
the
dust
which
each
put
into
a
purse
at
the
head
of
his
bed
one
day
the
news
came
to
the
saloon
that
one
of
the
purses
had
been
stolen
the
helms
boys
talked
it
over
and
concluded
that
as
one
of
the
men
had
gone
to
town
he
might
know
something
about
the
lost
dust
so
they
went
to
town
and
there
after
a
little
search
found
their
man
in
a
gambling
house
after
a
little
while
they
invited
him
to
return
to
camp
with
them
and
all
started
together
down
the
mountain
but
when
about
half
way
down
they
halted
suddenly
under
an
oak
tree
and
accused
their
man
of
knowing
where
his
partner
money
was
this
he
strongly
denied
and
was
very
positive
in
his
denial
till
he
felt
the
surprise
of
a
rope
around
his
neck
with
the
end
over
a
limb
and
beginning
to
haul
pretty
taut
in
a
direction
that
would
soon
elevate
his
body
from
the
ground
when
he
weakened
at
their
earnestness
and
asked
them
to
hold
on
a
minute
as
the
rope
slackened
he
owned
up
he
had
the
dust
and
would
give
it
up
if
they
would
not
send
the
news
to
his
folks
in
missouri
this
was
agreed
to
and
the
thief
was
advised
to
leave
at
once
for
some
distant
camp
or
they
might
yet
expose
him
he
was
not
seen
afterward
the
boys
bragged
a
good
deal
of
their
detective
ability
after
this
and
said
that
a
little
hanging
would
make
a
thief
tell
the
truth
even
if
it
did
not
make
an
honest
man
of
him
and
that
a
thief
would
be
lucky
if
he
got
through
with
them
and
saved
his
life
their
law
was
hanging
for
stealing
the
helms
brothers
were
said
to
be
from
western
missouri
and
in
early
days
were
somewhat
of
the
border
ruffian
order
and
of
course
preferred
to
live
on
the
frontier
rather
than
in
any
well
regulated
society
as
the
country
became
settled
and
improved
around
them
they
moved
on
a
school
house
was
an
indication
that
the
country
was
getting
too
far
advanced
for
them
they
crossed
the
plains
in
and
began
mining
operations
near
georgetown
in
placer
county
it
was
well
known
that
they
were
foremost
in
all
gambling
and
in
taking
a
hand
in
any
excitement
that
came
up
and
as
a
better
class
of
miners
came
in
they
moved
on
keeping
ahead
with
the
prospectors
and
just
out
of
reach
of
law
and
order
if
anyone
else
committed
a
crime
they
were
always
quite
eager
to
be
on
the
vigilance
committee
and
were
remarkably
happy
when
punishing
a
when
any
of
their
number
was
suspected
it
was
generally
the
case
that
they
moved
quickly
on
and
so
escaped
it
was
reported
however
that
one
of
their
number
was
in
the
hands
of
the
vigilance
committee
and
hanged
in
montana
after
a
time
it
is
said
they
went
down
to
southern
california
and
settled
on
the
border
of
the
colorado
desert
about
miles
east
of
san
diego
in
a
mountainous
and
desert
region
here
they
found
a
small
tribe
of
indians
and
by
each
marrying
a
squaw
they
secured
rights
equal
to
any
of
them
in
the
occupation
of
the
land
this
was
considered
pretty
sharp
practice
but
it
suited
them
and
they
became
big
chiefs
and
midecine
men
and
numerous
dusky
descendants
grew
up
around
them
it
is
said
that
their
property
consists
of
extensive
pasture
lands
on
which
they
raise
cattle
and
that
they
always
go
well
armed
with
pistol
rifle
and
riata
it
is
said
that
some
of
the
indians
undertook
to
claim
that
the
helms
brothers
were
intruders
but
that
in
some
mysterious
way
accidents
happened
to
most
of
them
and
they
were
left
without
any
serious
opposition
they
are
very
hospitable
and
entertaining
to
people
who
visit
them
provided
they
do
not
know
too
much
about
the
men
or
their
former
deeds
or
history
in
this
case
ignorance
is
bliss
and
it
is
folly
if
not
dangerous
to
be
too
wise
they
have
made
no
improvements
but
live
in
about
the
same
style
as
the
indians
and
about
on
a
level
with
them
morally
and
intellectually
there
may
be
those
who
know
them
well
but
the
writer
only
knows
them
by
hearsay
and
introduces
them
as
a
certain
type
of
character
found
in
the
early
days
as
i
was
now
about
barefoot
i
went
to
town
to
look
for
boots
or
shoes
there
were
no
shoes
and
a
pair
of
the
cheapest
boots
i
found
hanging
at
the
door
were
priced
to
me
at
two
ounces
this
seemed
a
wonderful
sum
for
a
pair
of
coarse
boots
that
would
sell
in
the
state
for
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
but
i
had
to
buy
them
at
the
price
or
go
barefoot
while
rambling
around
town
i
went
into
a
round
tent
used
as
a
gambling
saloon
the
occupants
were
mostly
men
and
one
or
two
nice
appearing
ladies
but
perhaps
of
doubtful
reputation
the
men
were
of
all
classes
lawyer
doctors
preachers
and
such
others
as
wanted
to
make
money
without
work
the
miners
especially
sailors
were
eager
to
try
to
beat
the
games
while
i
was
here
the
table
was
only
occupied
by
a
sailor
lying
upon
it
and
covered
with
a
green
blanket
all
at
once
the
fellow
noticed
a
large
walking
slowly
across
the
table
and
drawing
his
sheath
knife
made
a
desperate
stab
at
him
saying
you
kind
of
a
deck
hand
ca
play
at
this
game
our
claims
by
this
time
were
nearly
worked
out
and
i
thought
that
i
had
upward
of
two
thousand
dollars
in
gold
and
the
pile
looked
pretty
big
to
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
these
mines
were
very
shallow
and
would
soon
be
worked
out
at
least
in
a
year
or
two
i
could
not
see
that
the
land
would
be
good
for
much
for
farming
when
no
irrigation
could
be
easily
got
and
the
spanish
people
seemed
to
own
all
the
best
land
as
well
as
the
water
so
that
a
poor
fellow
like
myself
would
never
get
rich
at
farming
here
seeing
the
matter
in
this
light
i
thought
it
would
be
best
to
take
my
money
and
go
back
to
wisconsin
where
government
land
was
good
and
plenty
and
with
even
my
little
pile
i
could
soon
be
master
of
a
good
farm
in
a
healthy
country
and
i
would
there
be
rich
enough
thus
reasoning
i
decided
to
return
to
wisconsin
for
i
could
not
see
how
a
man
could
ever
be
a
successful
farmer
in
a
country
where
there
were
only
two
seasons
one
wet
and
the
other
long
and
dry
i
went
out
and
hunted
up
my
mule
which
i
had
turned
out
to
pasture
for
herself
and
found
her
entirely
alone
after
a
little
coaxing
i
caught
her
and
brought
her
with
me
to
camp
where
i
offered
her
for
sale
she
was
sleek
and
fat
and
looked
so
well
that
helms
said
that
if
i
could
beat
him
shooting
he
would
buy
both
mule
and
gun
so
three
or
four
of
us
tried
our
skill
my
opponents
boasted
a
good
deal
of
their
superior
marksmanship
but
on
the
trial
which
began
at
short
range
i
beat
them
all
pretty
badly
helms
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
offered
me
twelve
ounces
for
my
gun
and
mule
which
i
took
i
thought
a
great
deal
of
my
fat
little
mule
and
i
thought
then
as
i
think
now
how
well
she
did
her
part
on
the
fearful
road
to
and
from
death
valley
helms
was
now
going
to
the
valley
to
have
a
winter
hunt
for
here
the
snow
would
fall
four
feet
deep
and
no
mining
work
could
be
done
till
spring
when
he
would
return
and
work
his
claim
again
i
now
had
all
in
my
pocket
and
when
i
got
ready
to
go
bennett
was
much
affected
at
knowing
that
i
would
now
leave
them
perhaps
never
to
return
to
them
again
she
clasped
me
in
her
arms
embraced
me
as
she
would
her
own
son
and
said
good
luck
to
you
god
bless
you
for
i
know
that
you
saved
all
our
lives
i
do
suppose
you
will
ever
come
back
but
we
may
come
back
to
wisconsin
sometime
and
we
will
try
to
find
a
better
road
than
the
one
we
came
over
give
my
best
regards
to
all
who
inquire
after
us
she
shook
my
hand
again
and
again
with
earnest
pressure
and
cried
and
sobbed
bitterly
as
i
climbed
the
mountain
she
stood
and
watched
me
so
long
as
i
was
in
sight
and
with
her
handkerchief
waved
a
final
adieu
i
was
myself
much
affected
at
this
parting
for
with
and
bennett
had
been
really
a
home
to
me
she
had
been
to
me
as
a
mother
and
it
was
like
leaving
a
home
fireside
to
go
away
from
them
i
was
now
starting
out
among
strangers
and
those
i
should
meet
might
be
the
same
good
friends
as
those
whom
i
had
left
behind
bennett
and
i
had
for
many
years
been
hunting
companions
i
had
lived
at
his
house
in
the
east
and
we
never
disagreed
but
had
always
been
good
friends
i
had
now
a
traveling
companion
whose
home
was
in
iowa
where
i
had
lived
for
several
years
and
we
went
along
together
by
way
of
greenwood
where
there
was
a
small
mining
town
built
of
tents
many
of
which
were
used
as
gambling
places
these
places
were
occupied
by
gentlemen
some
of
whom
wore
white
shirts
to
distinguish
them
i
presume
from
the
common
herd
of
miners
from
whom
they
won
their
dust
we
crossed
the
american
river
at
salmon
falls
and
walked
thence
on
to
sacramento
city
which
was
the
largest
town
we
had
seen
on
the
coast
the
houses
were
all
small
wooden
ones
but
business
seemed
to
be
brisk
and
whiskey
shops
and
gambling
houses
plenty
one
game
played
with
three
cards
called
three
card
monte
was
played
openly
on
the
streets
with
goods
boxes
for
tables
every
one
who
came
along
was
urged
to
bet
by
the
dealer
who
would
lay
out
his
cards
face
up
so
all
could
see
them
then
turn
them
over
and
shuffle
them
and
say
i
bet
six
ounces
that
no
one
can
put
his
finger
on
the
queen
i
watched
this
a
while
and
saw
that
the
dealer
won
much
oftener
than
he
lost
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
simple
and
easy
way
to
make
a
living
when
money
was
plenty
we
strolled
around
town
looking
at
the
sights
and
the
different
business
places
the
most
lively
of
which
had
plenty
of
music
inside
lots
of
tables
with
plenty
of
money
on
them
and
many
questionable
lady
occupants
these
business
places
were
liberally
patronized
and
every
department
flourishing
especially
the
bar
oaths
and
vulgar
language
were
the
favorite
style
of
speech
and
very
many
of
the
people
had
all
the
whiskey
down
them
that
they
could
conveniently
carry
we
got
through
the
town
safely
and
at
the
river
we
found
a
steamboat
bound
for
san
francisco
and
the
fare
was
two
ounces
the
runners
were
calling
loudly
for
passengers
and
we
were
told
we
could
never
make
the
trip
any
cheaper
for
they
had
received
a
telegram
from
below
saying
that
no
boat
would
come
up
again
for
two
days
i
said
to
him
i
ca
see
your
telegram
where
is
it
at
this
he
turned
and
left
us
he
had
thought
no
doubt
that
miners
were
green
enough
to
believe
anything
in
the
course
of
an
hour
the
smoke
of
a
steamer
was
seen
down
the
river
and
this
beat
out
the
runners
who
now
offered
passage
for
half
an
ounce
at
this
time
there
was
no
telegraph
and
the
delay
was
a
lucky
one
for
us
we
took
passage
and
went
to
san
francisco
that
night
where
we
put
up
at
a
cheap
tavern
near
where
the
custom
house
now
stands
here
we
learned
that
we
would
have
to
wait
two
days
before
a
ship
would
sail
for
panama
and
during
this
time
we
surveyed
the
town
from
the
and
walked
all
over
the
principal
streets
it
was
really
a
small
poorly
built
dirty
looking
place
with
few
wharves
poor
cheap
hotels
and
very
rough
inhabitants
there
were
lots
of
gambling
houses
full
of
tables
holding
money
and
the
rooms
filled
with
pretty
rough
looking
people
except
the
card
dealers
most
of
whom
wore
white
shirts
and
a
few
sported
plug
hats
there
was
also
a
right
smart
sprinkling
of
ladies
present
who
were
well
dressed
and
adorned
with
rich
jewelry
and
their
position
seemed
to
be
that
of
paying
teller
at
the
gambling
tables
the
buildings
seemed
to
be
rather
cheap
although
material
was
very
expensive
as
well
as
labor
mechanics
of
all
sorts
getting
as
much
as
ten
or
twelve
dollars
per
day
for
work
coin
seemed
to
be
scarce
and
a
great
deal
of
the
money
needed
on
the
gambling
tables
was
represented
by
iron
washers
each
of
which
represented
an
ounce
of
gold
i
noticed
some
places
in
the
streets
where
it
was
muddy
and
a
narrow
walk
had
been
made
out
of
boxes
of
tobacco
and
sometimes
even
bacon
was
used
for
the
same
purpose
transportation
from
the
city
to
the
mines
was
very
slow
and
made
by
schooner
ship
loads
of
merchandise
had
arrived
and
been
unloaded
and
the
sailors
having
run
away
to
the
mines
everything
except
whiskey
and
cards
was
neglected
whiskey
sold
at
this
place
for
fifty
cents
a
drink
a
man
at
the
tavern
where
we
stopped
tried
hard
to
sell
me
a
lot
there
in
the
edge
of
the
mud
near
where
the
custom
house
now
stands
for
six
hundred
dollars
i
thought
this
a
pretty
high
price
and
besides
such
a
lot
was
no
use
to
me
for
i
had
never
lived
in
town
and
could
not
so
easily
see
the
uses
to
which
such
property
could
be
put
it
seemed
very
doubtful
to
me
that
this
place
would
ever
be
much
larger
or
amount
to
much
for
it
evidently
depended
on
the
mines
for
a
support
and
these
were
so
shallow
that
it
looked
as
if
they
would
be
worked
out
in
a
short
time
and
the
country
and
town
both
be
deserted
and
i
was
not
alone
in
thinking
that
the
country
would
soon
be
deserted
for
accustomed
as
we
all
had
been
to
a
showery
summer
these
dry
seasons
would
seem
entirely
to
prevent
extensive
farming
some
cursed
the
country
and
said
they
were
on
their
way
to
good
old
missouri
god
own
country
hearing
so
much
i
concluded
it
would
be
wise
not
to
invest
but
to
get
me
back
to
wisconsin
again
the
steamer
we
took
passage
in
was
the
northerner
advertised
to
sail
on
the
day
of
november
the
cabin
room
was
all
engaged
and
they
charged
us
nine
ounces
for
steerage
passage
but
i
did
not
care
as
much
about
their
good
rooms
and
clean
sheets
as
i
would
have
done
at
one
time
for
i
had
been
a
long
time
without
either
and
did
not
care
to
pay
the
difference
when
we
were
at
the
ship
office
we
had
to
take
our
turns
to
get
tickets
one
man
weighed
out
the
dust
and
another
filled
out
certificates
when
the
callers
began
to
get
a
little
scarce
i
looked
under
the
counter
where
i
saw
a
whole
panful
of
dust
to
which
they
added
mine
to
make
the
pile
a
little
higher
they
gave
out
no
berths
with
these
tickets
but
such
little
things
as
that
did
not
trouble
us
in
the
least
it
was
far
better
fare
than
we
used
to
have
in
and
about
death
valley
and
we
thought
we
could
live
through
anything
that
promised
better
than
the
desert
the
passenger
list
footed
up
four
hundred
and
forty
and
when
all
got
on
board
at
about
ten
in
the
morning
there
was
hardly
room
for
all
to
stand
up
comfortably
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
very
much
boat
in
which
to
put
to
sea
but
we
floated
out
into
the
current
with
all
the
faces
toward
the
shore
and
hats
and
handkerchiefs
waving
goodbye
to
those
who
had
come
down
to
see
the
safely
off
as
we
passed
out
through
the
wonderful
golden
gate
and
the
out
going
current
met
the
solid
sea
each
seemed
wrestling
for
the
mastery
and
the
waves
beat
and
dashed
themselves
into
foam
all
around
us
while
the
spray
came
over
the
bows
quite
lively
frightening
some
who
did
not
expect
such
treatment
when
we
had
passed
this
scene
of
watery
commotion
and
got
out
into
the
deeper
water
the
sea
smoothed
down
a
great
deal
but
began
to
claim
its
victims
at
first
a
few
then
more
and
more
till
the
greater
part
were
quite
badly
affected
i
had
a
touch
of
it
myself
but
managed
to
keep
my
feet
by
bracing
out
pretty
wide
and
hugging
everything
i
could
get
hold
of
that
seemed
to
offer
a
steady
support
and
i
did
not
lie
down
until
after
i
had
thrown
my
breakfast
overboard
by
the
time
dark
came
nearly
every
one
was
on
his
back
mostly
on
deck
and
no
one
asleep
all
were
retching
and
moaning
bitterly
some
who
had
a
few
hours
before
cursed
california
now
cursed
the
sea
and
declared
that
if
they
could
induce
the
captain
to
turn
about
and
put
them
back
on
shore
again
they
would
rather
creep
on
their
hands
and
knees
clear
back
to
old
missouri
over
rocks
and
sand
than
to
ride
any
further
on
such
a
miserable
old
boat
as
this
one
was
next
morning
the
decks
looked
pretty
filthy
and
about
all
the
food
the
passengers
had
eaten
was
now
spread
about
the
decks
in
a
half
digested
condition
most
of
the
passengers
were
very
sick
with
the
early
daylight
the
sailors
coupled
the
hose
to
the
big
steam
pump
and
began
the
work
of
washing
and
scrubbing
off
the
decks
and
though
many
begged
hard
to
be
left
alone
as
they
were
with
all
the
filth
a
good
flood
of
salt
water
was
the
only
answer
they
received
to
their
pleading
and
they
were
compelled
to
move
for
the
sailors
said
they
could
not
change
their
orders
without
the
captain
and
he
would
not
be
out
of
bed
till
ten
or
later
so
the
cursing
and
swearing
went
for
naught
and
the
decks
were
clean
again
there
were
no
deaths
to
report
but
there
were
very
few
to
do
duty
at
the
tables
in
eating
the
food
prepared
for
them
after
a
few
days
the
tables
filled
up
again
and
now
it
took
them
so
long
to
eat
that
there
had
to
be
an
order
for
only
two
meals
a
day
or
there
would
not
have
been
a
chance
for
all
to
get
something
they
were
terribly
hungry
now
and
every
one
seemed
to
try
his
best
to
take
in
provisions
enough
to
last
him
for
at
least
twelve
hours
as
the
fellows
began
to
get
their
sea
legs
on
they
began
to
talk
as
if
they
were
still
in
california
and
could
easily
manage
any
little
boat
like
this
and
could
run
things
as
they
did
when
they
crossed
the
plains
where
no
sheriff
court
or
judge
had
anything
to
say
about
matters
and
all
law
was
left
behind
they
began
to
act
as
if
they
were
lords
over
all
they
could
see
and
as
many
of
them
were
from
the
southern
states
they
seemed
to
take
an
especial
pride
in
boasting
of
how
they
did
as
they
pleased
about
like
the
helms
brothers
they
talked
as
if
they
could
run
the
world
or
the
universe
even
themselves
without
assistance
one
morning
at
breakfast
when
the
table
was
full
and
the
waiters
scarce
some
of
these
fellows
swore
and
talked
pretty
rough
and
as
a
waiter
was
passing
a
from
new
orleans
rose
in
his
seat
and
called
for
sugar
holding
the
empty
bowl
in
his
hand
but
the
waiter
passed
on
and
paid
no
attention
and
when
a
mulatto
waiter
came
along
behind
him
the
angry
man
damned
him
the
worst
he
could
ordering
him
to
bring
a
bowl
of
sugar
quick
this
waiter
did
not
stop
and
the
louisiana
man
threw
the
bowl
at
the
waiter
head
but
missed
it
and
the
bowl
went
crashing
against
the
side
of
the
ship
i
expected
surely
the
captain
and
his
men
would
come
and
put
the
unruly
fellow
in
irons
and
there
might
be
a
fight
or
a
riot
so
i
cut
my
meal
short
and
went
on
deck
about
as
soon
as
i
could
do
so
thinking
that
would
be
a
safer
place
but
the
captain
seemed
to
know
about
how
to
manage
such
fellows
and
never
left
his
stateroom
which
i
think
was
a
wise
move
the
darky
did
not
make
his
appearance
at
table
afterwards
and
the
man
who
threw
the
bowl
said
that
colored
folks
had
to
mind
a
gentleman
when
he
spoke
to
them
or
fare
worse
the
captain
now
got
out
his
passenger
list
and
we
all
had
to
pass
through
a
narrow
space
near
the
and
every
one
answer
to
his
name
and
show
his
ticket
this
made
work
for
about
one
day
some
stowaways
were
found
and
put
down
into
the
hole
to
heave
coal
one
day
the
captain
and
mate
were
out
taking
an
observation
on
the
sun
when
a
young
missourian
stepped
up
to
see
what
was
being
done
and
said
to
the
captain
captain
do
you
think
i
could
learn
how
to
do
that
kind
of
business
the
captain
took
the
young
man
hand
and
looked
at
his
nails
which
were
very
rough
and
dirty
and
said
no
my
lad
boys
with
such
finger
nails
ca
learn
navigation
this
made
a
big
laugh
at
the
brave
lubber
expense
many
of
the
ones
did
not
get
up
so
soon
and
some
died
of
that
or
something
else
and
their
bodies
were
sewed
up
in
blankets
with
a
bushel
of
coal
at
their
feet
to
sink
them
and
thrown
overboard
the
bodies
were
laid
out
on
a
plank
at
the
ship
side
the
captain
would
read
a
very
brief
service
and
the
sailors
would
at
the
appropriate
time
raise
the
end
of
the
plank
so
that
the
body
slid
off
and
went
down
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
in
due
time
we
went
into
the
harbor
of
acapulco
for
water
and
coal
here
nearly
every
one
went
on
shore
and
as
there
was
no
wharf
for
the
vessel
to
lie
to
the
native
canoes
had
many
passengers
at
a
dollar
apiece
for
passage
money
out
back
of
town
there
was
a
small
stream
of
clear
water
which
was
warm
and
nice
to
bathe
in
and
some
places
three
or
four
feet
deep
so
that
a
great
many
stripped
off
for
a
good
wash
which
was
said
to
be
very
healthful
in
this
climate
many
native
women
were
on
hand
with
soap
and
towels
ready
to
give
any
one
a
good
scrubbing
for
cents
and
those
who
employed
them
said
they
did
a
good
satisfactory
job
as
i
returned
to
town
the
streets
seemed
to
be
deserted
and
i
saw
one
man
come
out
on
an
adjoining
street
and
after
running
a
few
steps
fall
down
on
his
face
hearing
the
report
of
a
gun
at
the
same
time
i
hurried
on
to
get
out
of
danger
but
i
afterward
learned
that
the
man
was
a
travelling
gambler
who
had
come
across
the
country
from
mexico
and
that
he
was
killed
as
he
fell
no
one
seemed
to
care
for
him
near
the
beach
were
some
large
trees
and
under
them
dancing
was
going
on
to
the
music
of
the
guitar
there
were
plenty
of
pretty
spanish
girls
for
partners
and
these
and
our
boys
made
up
an
interesting
party
the
girls
did
not
seem
at
all
bashful
or
afraid
of
the
boys
and
though
they
could
not
talk
together
very
much
they
got
along
with
the
sign
language
and
the
ladies
seemed
very
fond
of
the
there
was
a
fort
here
a
regular
old
concern
and
the
soldiers
were
bare
footed
and
did
not
need
much
clothing
the
cattle
that
were
taken
on
board
here
were
made
to
swim
out
to
the
ship
and
then
with
a
rope
around
their
horns
hoisted
on
deck
a
distance
of
perhaps
forty
feet
above
the
water
the
maddened
brutes
were
put
into
a
secure
stall
ready
for
the
ship
butcher
the
small
boys
came
around
the
ship
in
canoes
and
begged
the
passengers
to
throw
them
out
a
dime
and
when
the
coin
struck
the
water
they
would
dive
for
it
never
losing
a
single
one
one
man
dropped
a
bright
bullet
and
the
boy
who
dove
for
it
was
so
enraged
that
he
called
him
a
d
d
gringo
englishman
none
of
these
boys
wore
any
clothes
this
town
like
all
spanish
towns
was
composed
of
houses
with
dry
mud
walls
the
country
around
looked
very
mountainous
and
barren
and
comfortably
warm
after
two
days
we
were
called
on
board
and
soon
set
sail
for
sea
again
and
now
as
we
approached
the
equator
it
became
uncomfortably
warm
and
an
awning
was
put
over
the
upper
deck
all
heavy
clothing
was
laid
aside
and
anyone
who
had
any
amount
of
money
on
his
person
was
unable
to
conceal
it
but
no
one
seemed
to
have
any
fear
of
theft
for
a
thief
could
not
conceal
anything
he
should
steal
and
no
one
reported
anything
lost
there
was
occasionally
a
dead
body
to
be
consigned
to
a
watery
grave
a
few
days
out
from
here
and
we
were
again
mustered
as
before
to
show
our
tickets
which
were
carefully
examined
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
the
water
was
the
poorest
fare
we
had
it
was
sickish
tasting
stuff
and
so
warm
it
would
do
very
well
for
there
were
many
interesting
things
to
see
sometimes
it
would
be
spouting
whales
sometimes
great
black
masses
rolling
on
the
water
looking
like
a
ship
bottom
upward
which
some
said
were
some
fish
seemed
to
be
at
play
and
would
jump
ten
feet
or
more
out
of
the
water
the
flying
fish
would
skim
over
the
waves
as
the
ship
wheels
seemed
to
frighten
them
and
we
went
through
a
hundred
acres
of
porpoises
all
going
the
same
way
the
ship
plowed
right
through
them
but
none
seemed
to
get
hurt
by
the
wheels
perhaps
they
were
emigrants
like
ourselves
in
search
of
a
better
place
it
now
became
terribly
hot
and
the
sun
was
nearly
overhead
at
noon
sometimes
a
shark
could
be
seen
and
though
he
seemed
to
make
no
effort
easily
kept
up
with
the
moving
ship
occasionally
we
saw
a
sea
snake
navigating
the
ocean
all
by
himself
i
did
not
understand
how
these
fellows
went
to
sea
and
lived
so
far
from
land
the
flying
fish
seemed
to
be
more
plentiful
as
we
went
along
and
would
leave
the
water
and
scud
along
before
us
we
had
evening
concerts
on
the
forecastle
managed
by
the
sailors
their
songs
were
not
sacred
songs
by
any
means
and
many
of
them
hardly
fit
to
be
heard
by
delicate
ears
we
again
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
narrow
passage
and
have
our
tickets
looked
over
and
this
time
a
new
stowaway
was
found
and
he
straightway
made
application
for
a
job
go
below
sir
was
all
the
captain
said
several
died
and
had
their
sea
burial
and
some
who
had
been
so
sick
all
the
way
as
not
to
get
out
of
bed
proved
tough
enough
to
stand
the
climate
pretty
well
as
we
were
nearing
panama
the
doctor
posted
a
notice
to
the
mast
cautioning
us
against
eating
much
fruit
while
on
shore
as
it
was
very
dangerous
when
eaten
to
excess
we
anchored
some
little
distance
from
the
shore
and
had
to
land
in
small
boats
managed
by
the
natives
i
went
in
one
and
when
the
boat
grounded
at
the
beach
the
boatman
took
me
on
his
back
and
set
me
on
shore
demanding
two
dollars
for
the
job
which
i
paid
and
he
served
the
whole
crowd
in
the
same
way
the
water
here
was
blood
warm
and
they
told
me
the
tide
ran
very
high
this
was
a
strange
old
town
to
me
walled
in
on
all
sides
a
small
plaza
in
the
center
with
a
catholic
church
on
one
side
and
the
other
houses
were
mostly
two
story
on
the
side
next
to
the
beach
was
a
high
thick
wall
which
contained
cells
that
were
used
for
a
jail
and
on
top
were
some
dismounted
cannon
long
and
old
fashioned
the
soldiers
were
poor
lazy
fellows
barefooted
and
had
very
poor
looking
guns
going
out
and
in
all
had
to
pass
through
a
large
gateway
but
they
asked
no
questions
the
streets
were
very
narrow
and
dirty
and
the
sleeping
rooms
in
the
second
story
of
the
houses
seemed
to
be
inhabited
by
cats
for
bed
clothes
was
needed
only
a
single
sheet
on
the
roofs
all
around
sat
turkey
buzzards
and
anything
that
fell
in
the
streets
that
was
possible
for
them
to
eat
was
gobbled
up
very
quickly
they
were
as
tame
as
chickens
and
walked
around
as
fearless
and
lordly
as
tame
turkeys
in
consideration
of
their
cleaning
up
the
streets
without
pay
they
were
protected
by
law
one
of
the
passengers
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
shoot
one
and
a
small
squad
of
soldiers
were
soon
after
him
and
came
into
a
room
where
there
were
fifty
of
us
but
could
not
find
their
man
he
would
have
been
sent
to
jail
if
he
had
been
caught
we
had
to
pay
one
dollar
a
night
for
beds
in
these
rooms
and
they
counted
money
at
the
rate
of
eight
dimes
to
the
dollar
the
old
town
of
panama
lies
a
little
south
in
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
was
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
long
ago
i
was
told
to
me
raised
in
the
north
everything
was
very
new
and
strange
in
way
of
living
style
of
building
and
kind
of
produce
there
were
donkeys
parrots
and
all
kinds
of
monkeys
in
plenty
most
of
the
women
were
of
very
dark
complexion
and
not
dressed
very
stylishly
while
the
younger
population
did
not
have
even
a
fig
leaf
or
anything
to
take
its
place
the
adults
dressed
very
economically
for
the
days
are
summer
days
all
the
year
round
and
the
clothing
is
scanty
and
cheap
for
either
sex
the
cattle
were
small
pale
red
creatures
and
not
inclined
to
be
very
fat
and
the
birds
mostly
of
the
parrot
kind
the
market
plaza
is
outside
the
walls
and
a
small
stream
runs
through
it
with
the
banks
pretty
thickly
occupied
by
washerwomen
all
the
washing
was
done
without
the
aid
of
a
fire
on
the
plaza
there
were
plenty
of
donkeys
loaded
with
truck
of
all
sorts
from
wood
green
grass
and
to
parrots
monkeys
and
all
kinds
of
tropical
fruits
outside
the
walls
the
houses
were
made
of
stakes
interwoven
with
palm
leaves
and
everything
was
green
as
well
as
the
grass
and
trees
very
little
of
the
ground
seemed
to
be
cultivated
and
the
people
were
lazy
and
idle
for
they
could
live
so
easily
on
the
wild
products
of
the
country
a
white
man
here
would
soon
sweat
out
all
his
ambition
and
enterprise
and
would
be
almost
certain
to
catch
the
panama
yellow
fever
the
common
class
of
the
people
here
i
should
say
were
spanish
and
negro
mixed
and
they
seem
to
get
along
pretty
well
but
the
country
is
not
suitable
for
white
people
it
seems
to
have
been
made
on
purpose
for
donkeys
parrots
and
negroes
the
cabin
passengers
engaged
all
the
horses
and
mules
the
country
afforded
on
which
to
ride
across
the
chagres
river
so
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
myself
and
companion
to
transfer
ourselves
on
foot
which
was
pretty
hard
work
in
the
hot
and
sultry
weather
my
gold
dust
began
to
grow
pretty
heavy
as
i
went
along
and
though
i
had
only
about
two
thousand
dollars
weighing
about
ten
pounds
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
weighed
fifty
pounds
by
the
way
that
it
bore
down
upon
my
shoulders
and
wore
sore
places
on
them
it
really
was
burdensome
i
had
worn
it
on
my
person
night
and
day
ever
since
leaving
the
mines
and
i
had
some
little
fear
of
being
robbed
when
off
the
ship
our
road
had
been
some
day
paved
with
cobble
stones
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
we
met
a
native
coming
in
with
a
big
green
lizard
about
two
feet
long
which
he
was
hauling
and
driving
along
with
a
string
around
its
neck
i
wondered
if
this
was
not
a
panama
butcher
bringing
in
a
fresh
supply
of
meat
when
we
reached
the
hills
on
our
way
from
panama
the
paved
road
ended
and
we
had
only
a
mule
trail
to
follow
the
whole
country
was
so
densely
timbered
that
no
man
could
go
very
far
without
a
cleared
road
in
some
places
we
passed
over
hills
of
solid
rock
but
it
was
of
a
soft
nature
so
that
the
trail
was
worn
down
very
deep
and
we
had
to
take
the
same
regular
steps
that
the
mules
did
for
their
tracks
were
worn
down
a
foot
or
more
on
the
road
we
would
occasionally
meet
a
native
with
a
heavy
pack
on
his
back
a
long
staff
in
each
hand
and
a
solid
sword
by
his
side
he
like
the
burro
grunted
every
step
he
took
they
seemed
to
carry
unreasonably
heavy
loads
on
their
backs
such
as
boxes
and
trunks
but
there
was
no
other
way
of
getting
either
freight
or
baggage
across
the
isthmus
at
that
time
it
looked
to
me
as
if
this
trail
might
be
just
such
a
one
as
one
would
expect
robbers
to
frequent
for
it
would
of
course
be
expected
that
californians
would
carry
considerable
money
with
them
and
we
might
reasonably
look
out
for
this
sort
of
gentry
at
any
turn
of
the
trail
we
were
generally
without
weapons
and
we
should
have
to
deliver
on
demand
and
if
any
one
was
killed
the
body
could
easily
be
concealed
in
the
thick
brush
on
either
side
of
the
trail
and
no
special
search
for
anyone
missing
would
occur
about
noon
one
day
we
came
to
a
native
hut
and
saw
growing
on
a
tree
near
by
something
that
looked
like
oranges
and
we
made
very
straight
tracks
with
the
idea
of
picking
some
and
having
a
feast
but
some
of
the
people
in
the
shanty
called
out
to
us
and
made
motions
for
us
not
to
pick
them
for
they
were
no
good
so
we
missed
our
treat
of
oranges
and
contented
ourselves
with
a
big
drink
of
water
and
walked
on
after
a
little
more
travel
we
came
to
another
shanty
made
of
poles
and
palm
leaves
occupied
by
an
american
he
was
a
tall
cadaverous
looking
renegade
who
looked
as
if
the
blood
had
all
been
pumped
out
of
his
veins
and
he
claimed
to
be
sick
he
said
he
was
one
of
the
texas
royal
sons
we
applied
for
some
dinner
and
he
lazily
told
us
there
were
flour
tea
and
bacon
and
that
we
could
help
ourselves
i
wet
up
some
flour
and
baked
some
cakes
made
some
poor
tea
and
fried
some
bacon
we
all
got
a
sort
of
dinner
out
of
his
pantry
stuff
and
left
him
a
dollar
apiece
for
the
accommodation
as
we
walked
on
my
companion
gave
out
and
could
carry
his
bundle
no
longer
so
i
took
it
along
with
my
own
and
we
got
on
as
fast
as
we
could
but
darkness
came
on
us
before
we
reached
the
chagres
river
and
we
had
to
stay
all
night
at
a
native
hut
we
had
some
supper
consisting
of
some
very
poor
coffee
crackers
and
a
couple
of
eggs
apiece
and
had
to
sleep
out
under
a
tree
where
we
knew
we
might
find
lizards
snakes
and
other
poisonous
reptiles
and
perhaps
a
thieving
monkey
might
pick
our
pockets
while
we
slept
before
it
was
entirely
dark
many
who
rode
horses
came
along
many
of
them
ladies
and
following
the
custom
of
the
country
they
all
rode
astride
among
this
crowd
was
one
and
somewhat
corpulent
old
fellow
by
profession
a
who
put
on
many
airs
the
old
fellow
put
on
his
cool
white
coat
in
fact
a
white
suit
throughout
and
in
this
tropical
climate
he
looked
very
comfortable
indeed
thus
attired
he
filled
his
breast
pocket
with
fine
cigars
and
put
in
the
other
pocket
a
flask
with
some
medicine
in
it
which
was
good
for
snake
bites
and
also
tending
to
produce
courage
in
case
the
man
not
used
to
riding
should
find
his
natural
spirits
failing
the
rest
of
his
luggage
was
placed
on
pack
animals
and
in
fact
the
only
way
luggage
was
carried
in
those
days
was
either
on
the
backs
of
donkeys
or
men
all
was
ready
for
a
start
and
the
captain
in
his
suit
was
mounted
on
a
mule
so
small
that
his
feet
nearly
touched
the
ground
the
little
animal
had
a
mind
of
his
own
and
at
first
did
not
seem
inclined
to
start
out
readily
but
after
a
bit
concluded
to
follow
his
fellow
animals
and
all
went
well
the
rider
was
much
amused
at
what
he
saw
sometimes
a
very
lively
monkey
sometimes
a
flock
of
paroquets
or
a
lizard
and
so
he
rode
along
with
a
very
happy
air
holding
his
head
up
and
smoking
a
fragrant
havana
with
much
grace
the
road
was
rough
and
rocky
with
a
now
and
then
of
rather
uncertain
depth
at
every
one
of
these
the
captain
mule
would
stop
put
down
his
head
blow
his
nose
and
look
wise
and
then
carefully
sound
the
miniature
sea
with
his
being
altogether
too
cautious
to
suit
his
rider
who
had
never
been
accustomed
to
a
craft
that
was
afraid
of
water
at
one
of
these
performances
the
mule
evidently
concluded
the
sea
before
him
was
not
safe
for
when
the
captain
tried
to
persuade
him
to
cross
his
persuasions
had
no
effect
then
he
coaxed
him
with
voice
gentle
soft
and
low
with
the
result
that
the
little
animal
took
a
few
very
short
steps
and
then
came
to
anchor
again
then
the
captain
began
to
get
slightly
roiled
in
temper
and
the
voice
was
not
so
gentle
sweet
and
low
but
it
had
no
greater
effect
upon
his
craft
he
began
to
get
anxious
for
the
others
had
gone
on
and
he
thought
perhaps
he
might
be
left
now
this
man
had
armed
his
heels
with
the
large
spanish
spurs
so
common
in
the
country
and
bringing
them
in
contact
with
the
force
due
to
considerable
impatience
mule
was
quite
suddenly
and
painfully
aware
of
the
result
this
was
harsher
treatment
than
he
could
peaceably
submit
to
and
at
the
second
application
of
the
spurs
a
pair
of
small
hoofs
were
very
high
in
the
air
and
the
captain
very
low
on
his
back
in
the
mud
and
water
having
been
blown
from
the
hurricane
deck
of
his
craft
in
a
very
sudden
and
lively
style
the
philosophical
mule
stood
very
still
and
looked
on
while
the
white
coat
and
pantaloons
were
changing
to
a
dirty
brown
and
watched
the
captain
as
he
waded
out
to
the
accompaniment
of
some
very
vigorous
swear
words
both
the
man
and
beast
looked
very
doubtful
of
each
other
future
actions
but
the
man
shook
the
water
off
and
bestowed
some
lively
kicks
on
his
muleship
which
made
him
bounce
into
and
through
the
and
the
captain
still
holding
the
bridle
followed
after
once
across
the
pool
the
captain
set
his
marine
eye
on
the
only
craft
that
had
been
too
much
for
his
navigation
and
said
vengeance
should
be
mine
and
in
this
doubtful
state
of
mind
he
cautiously
mounted
his
beast
again
and
fully
resolved
to
stick
to
the
deck
hereafter
at
all
hazards
he
hurried
on
and
soon
overtook
the
train
again
looking
quite
like
a
half
drowned
rooster
the
others
laughed
at
him
and
told
him
they
could
find
better
water
a
little
way
ahead
at
the
river
and
they
would
see
him
safely
in
the
captain
was
over
his
pet
and
made
as
much
fun
as
any
of
them
declaring
that
he
could
not
navigate
such
a
bloody
craft
as
that
in
such
limited
sea
room
for
it
was
dangerous
even
when
there
was
no
gale
to
speak
of
the
ladies
did
not
blush
at
the
new
and
convenient
costumes
which
they
saw
in
this
country
and
laughed
a
good
deal
over
the
way
of
traveling
they
had
to
adopt
any
who
were
sick
were
carried
in
a
kind
of
chair
strapped
to
the
back
of
a
native
passengers
were
strung
along
the
road
for
miles
going
and
coming
we
would
occasionally
sit
down
awhile
and
let
the
sweat
run
off
while
a
party
of
them
passed
us
some
were
mounted
on
horses
some
on
mules
and
some
on
donkeys
and
they
had
to
pay
twelve
dollars
for
the
use
of
an
animal
for
the
trip
our
night
at
this
wayside
deadfall
was
not
much
better
than
some
of
the
nights
about
death
valley
but
as
i
was
used
to
low
fare
i
did
not
complain
as
some
did
this
seemed
a
wonderful
country
to
a
northern
raised
boy
the
trail
was
lined
on
both
sides
with
all
kinds
of
palms
and
various
other
kinds
of
trees
and
shrubs
and
they
were
woven
together
in
a
compact
mass
with
trailing
and
running
vines
the
trees
were
not
tall
and
the
bark
was
as
smooth
as
a
young
hickory
the
roots
would
start
out
of
the
tree
three
feet
above
the
ground
and
stand
out
at
an
angle
and
looked
like
big
planks
placed
edgewise
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
too
many
plants
for
the
ground
to
support
and
so
they
grew
on
the
big
limbs
of
the
trees
all
around
the
same
as
the
mistletoe
on
the
oak
only
there
were
ever
so
many
different
kinds
the
weather
was
very
clear
and
the
sun
so
hot
that
many
of
the
travelers
began
to
wilt
and
sit
down
by
the
roadside
to
rest
many
walked
along
very
slowly
and
wore
long
faces
the
road
from
panama
to
crucez
on
the
chagres
river
was
eighteen
miles
long
and
all
were
glad
when
they
were
on
the
last
end
of
it
the
climate
here
seems
to
take
all
the
starch
and
energy
out
of
a
man
body
and
in
this
condition
he
must
be
very
cautious
or
some
disease
will
overtake
him
and
he
will
be
left
to
die
without
burial
for
his
body
if
he
has
no
personal
friends
with
him
we
started
on
the
next
morning
and
on
our
way
stepped
over
a
large
ship
anchor
that
lay
across
the
trail
i
suppose
the
natives
had
undertaken
to
pack
it
across
the
isthmus
and
found
it
too
heavy
for
them
perhaps
it
was
for
capt
kidd
the
great
pirate
for
it
is
said
that
he
often
visited
panama
in
the
course
of
his
cruising
about
in
search
of
treasures
passing
along
a
sandy
place
in
the
trail
a
snake
crossed
and
left
his
track
big
as
a
stovepipe
it
seemed
to
be
and
after
this
we
kept
a
sharp
watch
for
big
snakes
that
might
be
in
waiting
to
waylay
us
for
game
there
were
plenty
of
monkeys
and
parrots
climbing
and
chattering
around
in
the
trees
the
forest
is
here
so
dense
that
the
wind
never
blows
and
consequently
it
never
gets
cool
the
sun
ever
since
we
got
down
near
the
equator
was
nearly
overhead
and
the
moon
seemed
to
be
even
north
of
us
when
we
reached
the
chagres
river
we
hired
a
boat
of
an
irishman
for
the
trip
down
i
wondered
if
there
was
a
place
on
earth
so
desolate
that
the
paddy
would
not
find
it
the
boat
for
the
journey
cost
two
hundred
dollars
and
would
hold
passengers
enough
so
that
it
would
cost
us
ten
dollars
each
at
any
rate
and
perhaps
a
little
more
two
natives
had
charge
of
the
boat
and
did
the
navigating
there
were
two
ladies
among
the
passengers
and
when
the
two
natives
who
i
suppose
were
the
captain
and
mate
of
the
craft
came
on
board
clad
very
coolly
in
panama
hats
the
ladies
looked
at
them
a
little
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
and
made
the
best
of
it
our
two
navigators
took
the
oars
and
pulled
slowly
down
the
stream
nothing
but
water
and
evergreen
trees
could
we
see
for
the
shore
on
either
hand
was
completely
hidden
by
the
dense
growth
that
hung
over
and
touched
the
water
on
a
mud
bar
that
we
passed
a
huge
alligator
lay
taking
a
sun
bath
and
though
many
shots
were
fired
at
him
he
moved
away
very
leisurely
no
one
could
get
on
shore
without
first
clearing
a
road
through
the
thick
brushes
and
vines
along
the
bank
on
the
way
one
of
our
boatmen
lost
his
hat
his
only
garment
into
the
river
and
overboard
he
went
like
a
dog
and
soon
had
it
and
climbed
on
board
again
i
wondered
why
some
of
the
big
alligators
did
not
make
a
snap
at
him
the
water
in
the
run
looked
very
roily
and
dirty
and
no
doubt
had
fever
in
it
the
only
animals
we
saw
were
monkeys
and
alligators
and
there
were
parrots
in
the
trees
the
farther
we
went
down
the
stream
the
wider
it
became
and
the
current
slacker
so
that
we
moved
more
slowly
with
the
same
amount
of
rowing
at
a
place
called
dos
hermanos
two
brothers
we
could
see
a
little
cleared
spot
near
the
bank
which
seemed
to
be
three
or
four
feet
above
the
water
there
were
no
mountains
nor
hills
in
sight
and
the
whole
country
seemed
to
be
an
extensive
swamp
it
was
near
night
that
we
came
to
a
small
native
village
of
palm
huts
and
here
our
boatmen
landed
and
hid
themselves
and
not
being
able
to
find
them
we
were
compelled
to
stay
all
night
for
we
dare
not
go
on
alone
the
place
looked
like
a
regular
robbers
roost
and
being
forced
to
sleep
outside
the
huts
we
considered
it
safest
to
sleep
with
one
eye
open
we
would
have
gone
on
with
the
boat
only
that
we
were
afraid
the
river
might
have
more
than
one
outlet
and
if
we
should
take
the
wrong
one
we
might
be
too
late
for
the
steamer
which
even
now
we
were
afraid
would
not
wait
for
us
and
getting
left
would
be
a
very
serious
matter
in
this
country
we
had
very
little
to
eat
and
all
we
could
buy
was
sugar
cane
bananas
monkeys
and
parrots
we
kept
a
sharp
eye
out
for
robbers
keeping
together
as
much
as
we
could
for
we
knew
that
all
returning
californians
would
be
suspected
of
having
money
most
all
of
them
were
ready
for
war
except
myself
who
had
no
weapon
of
any
kind
all
of
these
people
had
a
bad
name
and
every
one
of
them
carried
a
long
bladed
knife
called
a
macheta
with
which
they
could
kill
a
man
at
a
single
blow
but
with
all
our
fears
we
got
through
the
night
safely
and
in
the
morning
found
our
boatmen
who
had
hidden
away
we
waited
not
for
breakfast
but
sailed
away
as
soon
as
we
could
and
reached
chagres
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
before
night
the
river
banks
here
are
not
more
than
three
feet
high
and
farther
back
the
land
fell
off
again
into
a
wet
swamp
of
timber
and
dense
vegetable
growth
the
town
was
small
and
poorly
built
on
the
immediate
bank
and
the
houses
were
little
brush
and
palm
affairs
except
the
boarding
house
which
was
t
shaped
the
front
two
stories
high
with
a
long
dining
room
running
back
having
holes
for
windows
but
no
glass
in
them
before
the
bell
rung
for
meals
a
long
string
of
hungry
men
would
form
in
line
and
at
the
first
tap
would
make
a
rush
for
the
table
like
a
flock
of
sheep
after
all
were
seated
a
waiter
came
around
and
collected
a
dollar
from
each
one
and
we
thought
this
paid
pretty
well
for
the
very
poor
grub
they
served
afterwards
no
ship
had
as
yet
been
in
sight
to
take
us
away
from
this
lowest
dirtiest
most
unhealthful
place
on
earth
and
the
prospect
of
remaining
here
had
nothing
very
charming
about
it
the
river
was
full
of
alligators
so
the
bathing
was
dangerous
and
the
whole
country
was
about
fit
for
its
inhabitants
which
were
snakes
alligators
monkeys
parrots
and
lazy
negroes
it
could
not
have
been
more
filthy
if
the
dregs
of
the
whole
earth
had
been
dumped
here
and
cholera
and
yellow
fever
were
easy
for
a
decent
man
to
catch
my
companion
and
i
went
out
on
the
beach
a
mile
or
two
to
get
the
salt
water
breeze
and
leave
the
stinking
malaria
for
those
who
chose
to
stay
in
the
hot
suffocating
village
and
here
we
would
stay
until
nearly
night
across
a
small
neck
of
water
was
what
was
called
a
fort
it
could
hardly
be
seen
it
was
so
covered
with
moss
and
vines
but
near
the
top
could
be
seen
something
that
looked
like
old
walls
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
it
and
i
should
judge
it
was
built
at
some
very
early
day
surely
there
was
nothing
here
to
protect
for
the
whole
country
did
not
seem
able
to
support
even
a
few
barefooted
soldiers
some
men
who
wandered
along
up
the
river
bank
following
a
path
said
they
had
seen
some
dead
human
bodies
thrown
into
the
swamp
and
left
probably
because
it
was
easier
than
putting
them
under
ground
for
a
bedroom
i
hired
a
little
platform
which
a
store
keeper
had
placed
before
his
store
where
i
slept
and
paid
a
dollar
for
the
privilege
some
one
walked
around
near
me
all
night
and
i
dared
not
close
more
than
one
eye
at
a
time
for
fear
of
losing
a
little
bag
of
gold
dust
this
little
bag
of
gold
was
getting
to
be
a
great
burden
to
me
in
this
sickly
climate
and
the
vigilant
guard
i
had
to
keep
over
so
small
a
treasure
was
very
tiresome
the
second
night
no
steamer
came
but
on
the
third
morning
the
steamer
was
riding
at
anchor
three
or
four
miles
out
and
soon
after
a
ship
came
in
from
the
atlantic
end
of
the
nicaragua
route
with
one
thousand
passengers
there
being
no
steamer
there
for
them
to
take
a
passage
home
on
and
so
they
had
to
come
here
for
a
start
this
filled
the
little
town
to
overflowing
but
as
the
ship
that
had
arrived
was
the
georga
one
of
the
largest
afloat
all
could
go
if
they
only
could
endure
the
fare
we
now
had
to
go
in
small
boats
from
the
shore
to
the
ship
and
the
trip
cost
two
dollars
and
a
half
i
waited
till
i
had
seen
some
of
the
boats
make
a
trip
or
two
and
then
choosing
one
that
had
a
sober
skipper
i
made
the
venture
it
was
said
that
one
drunken
boatman
allowed
his
boat
to
drift
into
some
breakers
and
all
were
lost
i
tell
you
i
was
over
anxious
to
get
out
of
this
country
for
i
well
knew
that
if
i
stayed
very
long
i
should
stay
forever
for
one
like
myself
raised
in
a
healthful
climate
could
not
remain
long
without
taking
some
of
the
fatal
diseases
the
country
was
full
of
we
made
the
trip
to
the
vessel
safely
and
as
our
boat
lay
under
the
ship
quarter
the
men
holding
the
ropes
i
looked
up
and
when
i
saw
the
swinging
rope
ladder
on
which
i
was
expected
to
climb
up
to
the
ship
deck
it
seemed
a
pretty
dangerous
job
but
i
mustered
up
courage
and
made
the
attempt
the
sea
was
pretty
rough
out
here
for
the
small
boats
and
the
ship
rolled
some
so
that
when
persons
tried
to
get
hold
of
the
ladder
they
were
thrown
down
and
sometimes
hurt
a
little
a
man
held
on
to
the
lower
end
of
the
ladder
so
that
the
one
who
was
climbing
might
not
get
banged
against
the
side
of
the
ship
and
have
his
breath
knocked
out
of
him
i
mounted
the
ladder
safely
and
climbed
away
like
a
monkey
reaching
the
deck
all
right
ladies
and
weak
people
were
hauled
up
in
a
sort
of
chair
with
a
block
and
rope
it
took
the
most
of
two
days
to
get
the
people
on
board
and
when
they
were
counted
up
there
were
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
forty
all
told
this
steamer
had
a
very
long
upper
deck
and
a
comparatively
short
keel
and
rolled
very
badly
and
as
for
me
i
had
swallowed
so
much
of
the
deadly
malaria
of
the
isthmus
that
i
soon
got
very
seasick
and
the
first
day
or
two
were
very
unpleasant
i
went
to
the
bar
and
paid
two
bits
for
a
glass
of
wine
to
help
my
appetite
but
it
staid
with
me
no
longer
than
time
enough
to
reach
the
ship
side
when
night
came
the
decks
were
covered
with
sleepy
men
and
if
the
weather
had
been
rough
and
all
sick
as
was
the
case
when
we
left
san
francisco
we
should
have
had
more
filthy
decks
than
we
had
even
on
that
occasion
approaching
the
harbor
at
havana
cuba
we
seemed
to
be
going
head
foremost
against
a
wall
of
solid
rock
but
when
within
speaking
distance
an
officer
came
in
sight
on
the
fort
right
before
us
and
shouted
through
his
speaking
trumpet
saying
why
do
you
salute
us
our
officer
said
you
know
us
well
enough
without
our
ship
had
a
small
cannon
on
the
forecastle
but
did
not
choose
to
use
it
and
i
suppose
the
cuban
officer
felt
slighted
we
now
turned
short
to
the
right
and
entered
the
beautiful
harbor
which
is
perfectly
landlocked
and
as
still
as
a
pond
the
city
is
all
on
the
right
side
of
the
bay
and
our
coal
yard
was
on
the
left
at
a
short
wharf
at
which
we
landed
a
lot
of
armed
soldiers
were
placed
a
short
distance
back
on
the
high
ground
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
go
beyond
them
we
now
had
a
port
officer
on
board
who
had
entire
charge
of
the
ship
and
if
anyone
wanted
to
go
to
the
city
across
the
bay
two
or
three
miles
he
had
to
pay
a
dollar
for
a
pass
this
pass
business
made
the
blue
bloods
terribly
angry
and
they
swore
long
and
loud
and
the
longer
they
talked
the
madder
they
got
and
more
bitter
in
their
feelings
so
that
they
were
ready
to
fight
not
with
this
time
the
weather
here
was
very
warm
and
the
heat
powerful
and
as
these
fellows
saw
there
was
only
one
course
to
be
pursued
if
they
wanted
to
get
on
shore
they
slowly
took
passes
good
for
all
day
and
paid
their
dollar
for
them
and
also
another
dollar
each
to
the
canoe
men
to
take
them
to
the
city
myself
and
companion
also
took
passes
and
went
over
arriving
at
the
city
we
walked
a
short
distance
and
came
to
the
plaza
which
is
not
a
very
large
one
here
was
a
single
grave
nicely
fenced
in
and
across
the
plaza
were
some
large
houses
in
front
of
which
was
stationed
a
squad
of
cavalry
standing
as
motionless
as
if
every
man
of
them
was
a
marble
statue
we
kept
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
chancing
to
meet
a
man
whom
we
rightly
supposed
to
be
an
englishman
we
inquired
about
the
grave
on
the
plaza
and
were
informed
that
it
was
that
of
christopher
columbus
the
discoverer
of
america
just
then
we
noticed
the
cavalry
moving
up
the
street
at
a
slow
gallop
and
so
formed
that
a
close
carriage
was
in
the
center
of
the
squad
as
they
rushed
by
and
we
gazed
at
them
with
purely
american
curiousity
our
new
english
friend
raised
our
hats
for
us
and
held
them
till
the
cavalcade
had
passed
merely
remarking
that
the
governor
general
was
within
the
carriage
we
spoke
perhaps
a
bit
unpleasantly
when
we
asked
him
why
he
was
so
ungentlemanly
in
his
treatment
of
us
as
to
remove
our
hats
but
he
said
my
friends
if
i
had
not
taken
off
your
hats
for
you
as
a
friend
some
of
those
other
fellows
would
have
knocked
them
off
so
i
did
for
you
an
act
of
greatest
kindness
for
every
one
removes
his
hat
when
the
governor
general
passes
he
also
informed
us
that
the
special
occasion
for
this
rather
pompous
parade
was
the
execution
of
some
criminals
at
a
park
or
prison
not
far
away
and
that
this
was
done
by
beheading
them
our
friend
proposed
that
we
also
walk
out
in
that
direction
and
we
went
with
him
to
the
edge
of
the
city
but
when
he
turned
into
a
by
path
that
did
not
seem
much
frequented
we
declined
to
follow
farther
and
turned
back
along
the
open
road
the
path
looked
to
us
a
sort
of
route
and
not
exactly
safe
for
unarmed
men
like
us
in
a
strange
country
the
man
followed
us
back
and
took
us
into
a
large
airy
saloon
in
the
center
of
which
a
big
fountain
was
playing
and
the
great
basin
in
which
the
water
fell
was
filled
with
beautiful
fish
our
friend
called
for
an
iced
drink
for
each
of
us
and
as
we
sat
at
the
table
we
tasted
it
and
found
it
rather
intoxicating
for
this
they
charged
us
one
dollar
each
but
we
noticed
that
our
friend
paid
nothing
and
we
set
him
down
as
a
sort
of
capper
after
the
style
we
had
seen
at
the
gold
mines
we
sat
a
few
minutes
and
then
so
coolly
bade
our
friend
that
he
had
not
the
face
to
follow
us
further
and
continued
our
walk
about
the
streets
which
seemed
to
us
very
narrow
and
the
houses
generally
two
stories
high
a
chaise
passed
us
containing
two
young
ladies
with
complexions
white
and
fair
and
eyes
and
hair
black
in
striking
contrast
the
carriage
was
drawn
by
two
horses
tandem
the
horse
in
the
shafts
being
mounted
by
a
big
negro
of
very
dignified
appearance
dressed
in
livery
and
having
top
boots
that
came
to
his
knees
this
was
the
only
vehicle
of
the
kind
we
saw
on
the
streets
we
did
not
dare
to
go
very
far
alone
for
with
our
ignorance
of
the
spanish
language
we
might
go
astray
and
not
get
back
to
the
ship
within
the
lifetime
of
our
passes
and
not
knowing
how
much
trouble
that
might
cause
us
we
were
naturally
a
little
timid
so
we
took
a
boat
back
to
the
ship
and
when
on
board
again
we
felt
safe
we
had
only
about
four
dollars
cash
left
a
big
gang
of
darkies
were
coaling
the
ship
each
one
carried
a
large
tub
full
of
coal
upon
his
head
and
poured
it
down
into
the
ship
hold
all
the
clothes
these
fellows
wore
was
a
strip
of
cloth
about
their
middle
when
they
were
let
off
for
dinner
they
skimmed
off
all
they
could
get
from
the
ship
slop
barrel
which
stood
on
the
wharf
alongside
to
help
out
their
very
scanty
food
the
overseer
stood
by
them
all
the
time
with
a
big
whip
and
made
them
hurry
up
as
fast
as
possible
talking
spanish
pretty
vigorously
and
though
we
could
not
understand
we
made
up
our
minds
that
a
good
part
of
it
was
swearing
the
next
morning
the
steamship
prometheus
came
in
and
tied
up
near
us
and
soon
word
was
brought
that
she
would
take
the
new
orleans
passengers
on
board
and
sail
immediately
for
that
port
it
now
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
get
nearer
home
by
going
up
the
mississippi
river
than
by
way
of
new
york
so
i
went
on
board
the
prometheus
and
we
soon
sailed
out
of
the
harbor
passing
under
the
gate
of
the
fortress
called
i
think
san
juan
de
ulloa
nothing
special
occurred
during
our
passage
till
we
were
near
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
river
when
in
the
absence
of
a
pilot
boat
or
tug
our
captain
thought
he
would
try
to
get
in
alone
and
as
a
consequence
we
were
soon
fast
in
the
mud
the
captain
now
made
all
the
passengers
go
aft
and
worked
the
engine
hard
but
could
not
move
her
at
all
the
tide
was
now
low
and
there
was
a
prospect
that
we
should
have
to
wait
full
six
hours
to
get
away
we
worked
on
however
and
after
a
few
hours
a
tug
came
to
our
assistance
and
pulled
us
out
of
the
mud
and
towed
us
into
the
right
channel
up
which
we
steamed
on
our
way
to
new
orleans
miles
away
the
country
on
both
sides
of
us
was
an
immense
marsh
no
hills
in
sight
no
timber
nothing
but
the
same
level
marsh
or
prairie
when
we
were
nearer
the
crescent
city
some
houses
came
in
sight
then
we
passed
general
jackson
and
in
due
time
reached
the
city
on
board
this
ship
i
became
acquainted
with
dick
evans
who
lived
in
the
same
county
that
i
used
to
in
wisconsin
near
mineral
point
so
the
three
of
us
now
concluded
to
travel
together
new
orleans
seemed
to
be
a
very
large
city
near
the
levee
a
large
government
building
was
in
course
of
construction
for
a
custom
house
it
was
all
of
stone
and
the
walls
were
up
about
two
stories
we
put
up
at
a
private
boarding
house
and
the
first
business
was
to
try
and
sell
our
gold
dust
so
we
went
to
the
mint
and
were
told
we
would
have
to
wait
ten
days
to
run
it
through
the
mill
and
we
did
not
like
to
wait
so
long
we
were
shown
all
through
the
mint
and
saw
all
the
wonders
of
coin
making
every
thing
seemed
perfect
here
beautiful
machinery
was
in
operation
making
all
sizes
of
gold
coins
from
a
twenty
dollar
piece
down
strips
of
gold
bands
about
six
feet
long
and
of
the
proper
thickness
for
twenty
dollar
pieces
are
run
through
a
machine
which
cuts
out
the
pieces
and
when
these
are
cut
they
can
stamp
out
the
pieces
as
fast
as
one
can
count
this
was
the
most
ingenious
work
i
ever
saw
and
very
wonderful
and
astonishing
to
a
backwoodsman
like
myself
for
i
supposed
that
money
was
run
in
moulds
like
bullets
as
we
could
not
wait
we
went
to
a
bank
and
sold
our
dust
getting
only
sixteen
dollars
per
ounce
the
same
price
they
paid
in
california
we
now
took
the
cars
and
rode
out
to
lake
ponchartrain
most
of
the
way
over
a
trestle
work
we
found
a
wharf
and
warehouse
at
the
lake
and
a
steamer
lay
there
all
ready
to
go
across
to
the
other
side
the
country
all
about
looked
low
with
no
hills
in
sight
when
we
returned
to
the
city
we
looked
all
about
and
in
the
course
of
our
travels
came
to
a
slave
market
here
there
were
all
sorts
of
black
folks
for
sale
big
and
little
old
and
young
and
all
sorts
they
all
seemed
and
were
clean
and
seemed
to
think
they
were
worth
a
good
deal
of
money
looking
at
them
a
few
minutes
sent
my
mind
back
to
joseph
missouri
where
i
saw
a
black
sold
at
auction
from
my
standpoint
of
education
i
did
not
approve
of
this
way
of
trading
in
colored
people
we
continued
our
stroll
about
the
city
coming
to
a
cemetery
where
i
looked
into
a
newly
dug
grave
to
find
it
half
full
of
water
on
one
side
were
many
brick
vaults
above
ground
the
ground
here
is
very
low
and
wet
and
seemed
to
be
all
swamp
the
drainage
was
in
surface
gutters
and
in
them
the
water
stood
nearly
still
it
seemed
to
me
such
water
must
have
yellow
fever
in
it
for
a
long
way
along
the
levee
the
steamboats
lay
thick
and
close
together
unloading
cotton
hemp
sugar
hoop
poles
bacon
and
other
products
mostly
the
product
of
negro
labor
here
our
friend
evans
was
taken
sick
and
as
he
got
no
better
after
a
day
or
two
we
called
a
doctor
to
examine
him
he
pronounced
it
a
mild
case
of
yellow
fever
his
skin
was
yellow
in
places
and
he
looked
very
badly
the
doctor
advised
us
to
go
on
up
the
river
saying
it
was
very
dangerous
staying
here
with
him
evans
gave
me
most
of
his
money
and
all
of
his
gold
specimens
to
take
to
his
wife
and
when
he
got
well
he
would
follow
us
we
bade
him
and
with
many
wishes
for
his
speedy
recovery
we
took
passage
on
a
steamer
for
louis
this
steamer
the
atlantic
proved
to
be
a
real
floating
palace
in
all
respects
the
table
was
supplied
with
everything
the
country
afforded
and
polite
and
darkies
were
numerous
as
table
waiters
this
was
the
most
pleasant
trip
i
had
ever
taken
and
i
could
not
help
comparing
the
luxuriance
of
my
coming
home
to
the
hardships
of
the
outward
journey
across
the
plains
and
our
starvation
fare
our
boat
was
rather
large
for
the
stage
of
water
this
time
of
year
and
we
proceeded
rather
slowly
but
i
cared
little
for
speed
as
bed
and
board
were
extra
good
and
a
first
cabin
passage
in
the
company
of
friends
many
of
whom
were
going
to
the
same
part
of
wisconsin
as
myself
was
not
a
tedious
affair
by
any
means
at
night
gambling
was
carried
on
very
extensively
and
money
changed
hands
freely
as
the
result
of
sundry
games
of
poker
which
was
the
popular
game
we
reached
louis
in
time
and
here
was
the
end
of
our
boat
run
the
river
had
some
ice
floating
on
its
surface
and
this
plainly
told
us
that
we
were
likely
to
meet
more
ice
and
colder
weather
as
we
went
north
we
concluded
to
take
the
illinois
river
boat
from
here
to
peoria
and
paid
our
passage
and
stepped
on
board
we
were
no
more
than
half
way
through
this
trip
when
the
ice
began
to
form
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
soon
became
so
thick
and
strong
that
the
boat
finally
came
to
a
perfect
standstill
frozen
in
solid
we
now
engaged
a
farm
wagon
to
take
us
to
peoria
from
which
place
we
took
regular
stages
for
galena
our
driver
was
inclined
to
be
very
merciful
to
his
horses
so
we
were
two
days
in
reaching
that
town
but
perhaps
it
was
best
for
the
roads
were
icy
and
slippery
and
the
weather
of
the
real
winter
sort
from
here
we
hired
a
team
to
take
four
of
us
to
plattville
and
then
an
walk
brought
me
to
mineral
point
the
place
from
which
i
started
with
my
winnebago
pony
in
i
had
now
finished
my
circle
and
brought
both
ends
of
the
long
belt
together
i
now
went
to
a
drug
store
and
weighed
evans
specimens
wrapping
each
in
a
separate
piece
of
paper
with
the
value
marked
on
each
and
took
them
to
his
wife
to
whom
i
told
the
news
about
her
husband
in
two
week
time
he
came
home
sound
and
well
i
was
quite
disappointed
in
regard
to
the
looks
and
business
appearance
of
the
country
it
looked
thinly
settled
people
scarce
and
business
dull
i
could
not
get
a
day
work
to
do
and
i
could
not
go
much
farther
on
foot
for
the
snow
was
eight
or
ten
inches
deep
and
i
was
still
several
hundred
miles
from
my
parents
in
michigan
so
my
journey
farther
east
was
delayed
until
spring
the
hunting
season
was
over
and
when
i
came
into
mineral
point
without
a
gun
and
wore
good
clothes
making
a
better
appearance
than
i
used
to
they
seemed
to
think
i
must
be
rich
and
showed
me
marked
attention
and
made
many
inquiries
about
their
neighbors
who
started
for
california
about
the
same
time
i
did
the
young
ladies
smiled
pleasantly
when
near
me
and
put
on
their
best
white
aprons
looking
very
tidy
and
bright
far
superior
to
any
of
the
ladies
i
had
seen
in
my
crooked
route
from
san
francisco
through
acapulco
panama
the
west
indies
and
along
the
mississippi
after
a
few
days
in
town
i
went
out
into
the
neighborhood
where
i
used
to
live
and
stopped
with
hall
who
used
to
be
a
neighbor
of
bennett
as
he
had
invited
me
to
stay
with
himself
and
wife
who
were
the
only
occupants
of
a
good
house
and
all
was
pleasant
but
notwithstanding
all
the
comfort
in
which
i
was
placed
i
grew
lonesome
for
the
enforced
idleness
on
account
of
the
stormy
weather
was
a
new
feature
in
my
life
and
grew
terribly
monotonous
after
some
delay
i
concluded
to
write
to
my
parents
in
michigan
and
give
them
a
long
letter
with
something
of
a
history
of
my
travels
and
to
refresh
my
memory
i
got
out
my
memorandum
i
had
kept
through
all
my
journey
as
my
letter
was
liable
to
be
quite
lengthy
i
bought
a
quantity
of
foolscap
paper
and
begun
i
took
my
diary
as
my
guide
and
filled
out
the
ideas
suggested
in
it
so
they
would
understand
them
i
soon
ran
through
with
my
paper
and
bought
more
and
kept
on
writing
the
weather
was
cold
and
stormy
and
i
found
it
the
best
occupation
i
could
have
to
prevent
my
being
lonesome
so
i
worked
away
day
after
day
for
about
a
month
and
i
was
really
quite
tired
of
this
sort
of
work
before
i
had
all
the
facts
recorded
which
i
found
noted
down
in
my
diary
my
notes
began
in
march
in
wisconsin
and
ended
in
february
on
my
return
to
mineral
point
i
found
as
the
result
of
my
elaboration
over
three
hundred
pages
of
closely
written
foolscap
paper
and
i
felt
very
much
relieved
when
it
was
done
by
the
aid
of
my
notes
i
could
very
easily
remember
everything
that
had
taken
place
during
my
absence
and
it
was
recorded
in
regular
form
with
day
and
date
not
an
incident
of
any
importance
left
out
and
every
word
as
true
as
gospel
i
had
neither
exaggerated
nor
detracted
from
any
event
so
far
as
i
could
recollect
i
now
loaned
hall
with
whom
i
lived
six
hundred
dollars
to
enable
him
to
cross
the
plains
to
california
and
try
to
make
his
fortune
to
secure
this
i
took
a
mortgage
on
his
farm
and
he
set
out
to
make
the
journey
i
had
another
eighty
acres
of
land
near
here
which
i
bought
at
government
price
before
going
to
california
but
i
could
not
now
sell
it
for
what
it
cost
me
when
i
went
away
i
had
left
my
chest
and
contents
with
my
friend
samuel
zollinger
and
he
had
kept
it
safely
so
i
now
made
him
my
lawful
agent
i
placed
my
narrative
and
some
other
papers
in
the
chest
and
gave
the
key
into
his
charge
while
i
went
north
across
the
wisconsin
river
to
visit
my
old
hunting
and
trapping
friend
robert
mccloud
here
i
made
a
very
pleasant
visit
of
perhaps
a
week
and
the
common
prospects
of
the
country
were
freely
talked
over
it
seemed
to
us
as
if
the
good
times
were
still
far
off
every
day
was
like
sunday
so
far
as
anything
going
on
no
money
in
circulation
many
places
abandoned
and
like
myself
many
had
gone
to
california
to
seek
gold
instead
of
lead
the
mines
at
mineral
point
are
mostly
of
lead
with
some
copper
looking
at
matters
in
this
light
it
did
not
need
a
great
deal
of
mccloud
persuasion
to
induce
me
to
go
back
with
him
to
california
all
the
more
so
as
my
little
pile
seemed
to
look
smaller
every
day
while
three
or
four
years
ago
it
would
have
seemed
quite
large
deciding
to
go
i
wrote
to
zollinger
to
send
the
account
i
had
written
to
my
parents
in
michigan
reading
it
first
himself
and
admonishing
him
not
to
lend
it
i
also
wrote
to
my
parents
telling
them
what
they
might
look
for
in
the
mails
and
cautioning
them
never
to
have
it
printed
for
the
writing
was
so
ungrammatical
and
the
spelling
so
incorrect
that
it
would
be
no
credit
to
me
i
afterward
learned
that
in
time
they
received
the
bundle
of
paper
and
read
it
through
and
through
and
circulated
it
around
the
neighborhood
till
it
was
badly
worn
and
laid
it
away
for
future
perusal
when
their
minds
should
incline
that
way
but
the
farm
house
soon
after
took
fire
and
burned
my
labor
going
up
in
smoke
when
the
news
of
this
reached
me
i
resolved
to
try
to
forget
all
the
trials
troubles
and
hardships
i
had
gone
through
and
which
i
had
almost
lived
over
again
as
i
wrote
them
down
and
i
said
to
myself
that
i
would
not
talk
about
them
more
than
i
could
help
the
sooner
to
have
them
vanish
and
never
write
them
down
again
but
a
few
years
ago
an
accident
befell
me
so
that
i
could
not
work
and
i
from
my
determination
when
i
was
persuaded
so
earnestly
by
many
friends
to
write
the
account
which
appeared
a
few
years
ago
in
the
santa
clara
valley
now
the
pacific
tree
and
vine
edited
by
brainard
at
san
jose
california
the
diary
was
lost
and
from
memory
alone
the
facts
have
been
rehearsed
and
it
is
but
fair
to
tell
the
reader
that
the
hardest
and
worst
of
it
has
never
been
told
nor
will
it
ever
be
chapter
xvi
mccloud
and
i
now
took
his
skiff
and
for
two
days
floated
down
the
wisconsin
river
till
we
reached
the
mississippi
boarded
the
first
steamboat
we
could
hail
and
let
our
own
little
craft
adrift
in
due
time
we
reached
louis
and
boarded
another
steamer
for
new
orleans
at
a
about
dark
a
lot
of
negroes
little
and
big
came
on
board
to
sell
brooms
the
boat
clerk
seemed
to
know
negro
character
pretty
well
so
he
got
out
his
violin
and
played
for
them
for
a
while
the
young
colored
gentry
listened
in
silence
but
pretty
soon
he
struck
a
tune
that
suited
them
and
they
began
to
dance
in
their
own
wild
style
in
seven
days
from
louis
we
landed
in
new
orleans
and
found
the
government
steamer
falcon
advertised
to
sail
in
two
days
we
went
together
to
one
of
the
slave
warehouses
outside
and
in
all
was
neat
end
clean
and
any
day
you
could
see
men
women
and
children
standing
under
the
shed
as
a
sign
of
what
they
had
within
and
the
painted
signs
for
sale
displayed
conspicuously
we
were
very
civilly
treated
and
invited
to
examine
the
goods
offered
for
sale
there
were
those
of
all
ages
and
all
colors
for
some
were
nearly
white
and
some
intensely
black
with
all
the
shades
between
all
were
to
be
sold
separately
or
in
families
or
in
groups
as
buyers
might
desire
all
were
made
to
keep
themselves
clean
and
neatly
dressed
and
to
behave
well
with
a
smile
to
all
the
visitors
whether
they
felt
like
smiling
or
not
some
seemed
really
anxious
to
get
a
good
master
and
when
a
kind
pleasant
looking
man
came
along
they
would
do
their
utmost
to
be
agreeable
to
him
and
inquire
if
he
did
not
want
to
buy
them
we
talked
it
over
some
between
ourselves
and
when
we
thought
of
the
market
and
the
human
chattels
for
sale
there
mccloud
spoke
up
and
said
i
am
almost
persuaded
to
be
an
abolitionist
i
now
went
on
board
the
steamer
falcon
in
command
of
a
government
officer
to
try
to
learn
something
about
the
family
of
capt
culverwell
who
perished
alone
in
death
valley
he
told
me
he
had
once
belonged
to
the
navy
and
had
his
life
insured
and
as
i
was
an
important
witness
for
his
family
i
wanted
to
learn
where
they
lived
the
captain
looked
over
a
list
of
officers
but
culverwell
name
was
not
there
i
then
wrote
a
letter
to
washington
stating
the
facts
of
his
death
and
my
own
address
in
sacramento
california
i
also
stated
that
i
would
assist
the
widow
if
i
could
but
i
never
received
an
answer
we
soon
started
down
the
river
having
on
board
about
one
hundred
passengers
men
going
to
work
on
the
panama
railroad
at
chagres
we
found
a
small
stern
wheeled
river
steamer
and
took
passage
on
it
for
gorgona
as
far
as
the
steamer
could
well
go
up
the
river
while
going
up
we
met
a
similar
boat
coming
down
and
being
near
a
short
bend
they
crashed
together
breaking
down
our
guards
severely
but
fortunately
with
no
damage
to
our
wheel
a
few
miles
above
this
a
dark
passing
cloud
gave
us
rain
in
streams
and
we
had
to
drift
in
near
shore
to
wait
for
the
storm
to
pass
i
never
before
saw
water
fall
so
fast
and
yet
in
half
an
hour
the
sun
was
out
and
burning
hot
before
we
reached
gorgona
we
got
acquainted
with
a
man
named
john
briggs
from
wisconsin
and
lyman
ross
from
rhode
island
and
concluded
to
travel
in
company
our
fare
thus
far
was
ten
dollars
and
two
horses
to
panama
for
which
we
paid
twelve
dollars
each
we
now
rode
and
walked
turn
about
and
when
we
inquired
about
the
road
we
were
told
that
being
once
in
it
we
could
not
possibly
get
out
except
at
the
other
end
and
would
need
no
guide
and
at
the
end
of
a
very
disagreeable
day
work
we
reached
the
big
gate
at
panama
and
entered
the
ancient
city
we
waited
but
little
here
before
taking
the
steamer
southerner
bound
for
san
francisco
three
days
after
we
sailed
away
one
of
our
passengers
went
overboard
a
corpse
and
three
or
four
more
died
and
were
buried
alongside
before
we
reached
acapulco
here
we
took
on
water
and
coal
and
were
soon
at
sea
again
mccloud
soon
had
to
take
his
place
in
the
sick
ward
and
i
attended
him
most
of
the
time
but
was
not
allowed
to
give
him
anything
without
a
permit
from
the
doctor
and
the
long
delays
between
the
administrations
of
medicine
made
the
sickness
hard
to
endure
the
sick
could
see
the
dead
sewed
up
in
blankets
with
a
bucket
of
coal
for
a
weight
then
resting
on
a
plank
with
sailors
on
each
side
the
mate
would
read
the
brief
services
appropriate
to
a
burial
at
sea
the
plank
was
tilted
and
the
lifeless
body
slid
down
into
the
depths
such
scenes
were
no
benefit
to
the
suffering
for
each
might
think
his
turn
was
next
when
a
bright
hope
and
prospect
would
be
better
for
his
recovery
one
forenoon
the
fire
gong
rang
out
sharply
and
all
was
in
confusion
supposing
the
ship
to
be
on
fire
but
nothing
could
be
seen
but
a
dense
fog
except
as
a
gentle
wind
lifted
it
a
little
and
there
dead
ahead
was
a
rocky
island
against
which
it
seemed
we
must
dash
to
destruction
for
there
was
no
beach
and
very
little
chance
for
any
one
to
be
saved
ten
minutes
more
in
this
direction
and
we
were
lost
but
the
officers
quickly
changed
the
course
and
we
passed
the
pile
of
rocks
scarcely
a
rifle
shot
away
whose
fault
it
was
this
danger
so
miraculously
avoided
we
did
not
know
the
captain
or
the
imperfect
chart
and
opinions
were
freely
given
both
ways
about
those
days
the
air
felt
cooler
the
fog
less
dense
and
the
foggy
we
had
seen
so
much
when
the
sun
tried
to
shine
were
scarce
while
a
more
northern
wind
created
a
coolness
that
made
sick
folks
feel
refreshed
and
hopeful
it
gave
me
a
chance
to
cheer
up
my
sick
friend
who
was
still
in
bed
and
tell
him
it
would
continue
to
be
cooler
as
we
went
on
the
fourth
of
july
the
officers
produced
the
ship
full
supply
of
flags
and
the
sailors
climbed
high
and
low
fastening
them
to
every
rope
till
we
had
a
very
gay
independence
day
appearance
in
this
gay
dress
we
steamed
into
san
diego
harbor
to
leave
the
mail
for
a
few
soldiers
stationed
there
and
get
their
letters
in
return
i
could
see
no
town
in
san
diego
but
a
beautiful
harbor
and
some
poor
looking
mustard
wigwams
some
way
off
seemed
to
contain
the
good
people
of
that
place
a
boat
with
a
small
crew
pulled
out
and
came
alongside
to
get
the
mail
and
deliver
theirs
and
then
we
turned
to
sea
again
the
country
all
around
this
beautiful
little
harbor
looked
mountainous
and
extremely
barren
and
no
one
wanted
to
go
on
shore
about
dark
we
had
made
sufficient
offing
and
turned
northward
plowing
through
large
fields
of
kelp
the
next
morning
the
forward
watch
announced
land
ahead
which
could
dimly
be
seen
as
the
fog
rose
the
officers
rushed
on
deck
and
could
see
not
far
ahead
a
sandy
beach
and
a
moment
more
showed
that
we
were
headed
directly
for
it
and
that
it
was
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
quickly
the
helmsman
was
given
orders
to
steer
almost
west
instead
of
the
north
course
he
had
been
following
he
was
asked
why
he
kept
on
his
north
course
when
he
saw
danger
ahead
and
answered
it
is
my
business
to
steer
according
to
orders
even
if
the
ship
goes
ashore
and
i
can
not
change
course
unless
ordered
to
the
captain
now
examined
his
chart
and
decided
he
was
in
san
pedro
harbor
off
los
angeles
the
sun
came
out
bright
and
clear
a
little
later
and
i
got
mccloud
out
of
his
bed
and
gave
him
a
seat
at
the
ship
side
where
he
could
see
the
green
grassy
hills
near
the
beach
and
larger
hills
and
mountains
farther
back
we
could
see
cattle
feeding
in
the
nearest
pastures
and
the
whole
scene
was
a
pleasant
one
and
as
we
sat
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
ship
and
snuffed
the
cool
breeze
which
came
from
the
north
we
thought
we
were
comparatively
happy
people
and
hoped
that
if
no
accident
befell
we
would
soon
be
at
the
end
of
our
voyage
on
the
seventh
day
of
july
we
entered
the
golden
gate
this
being
my
second
arrival
in
california
on
our
trip
from
panama
seven
or
more
had
died
and
been
buried
at
sea
but
the
remainder
of
us
were
quite
safe
and
sound
we
found
the
heart
of
the
city
still
smoking
for
a
fire
had
broken
out
on
july
fourth
and
burned
extensively
and
these
broad
blackened
ruins
were
the
result
some
said
the
work
had
been
done
by
the
sidney
ducks
and
their
numerous
helpers
who
were
really
the
rulers
of
the
city
the
place
now
looked
much
worse
than
it
did
when
i
left
in
november
before
these
sidney
ducks
were
english
convicts
from
australia
and
other
thieves
and
robbers
joined
them
as
agreeable
companion
making
a
large
class
that
seemed
to
glory
in
destruction
and
a
chance
for
booty
i
walked
around
over
the
hills
where
i
could
see
the
burned
district
and
the
destruction
of
so
much
valuable
property
and
when
i
thought
the
civil
law
was
not
strong
enough
to
govern
it
seemed
to
me
it
would
be
a
good
place
for
such
men
as
the
helms
brothers
of
georgetown
to
come
down
and
do
a
little
hanging
business
for
they
could
here
find
plenty
to
do
and
they
could
carry
out
their
plan
of
letting
no
guilty
man
escape
about
four
one
afternoon
we
went
aboard
the
sacramento
steamer
antelope
paying
our
passage
with
half
an
ounce
apiece
and
were
soon
on
our
way
past
the
islands
and
up
the
bay
when
we
were
beyond
benicia
where
the
river
banks
were
close
mccloud
sat
watching
the
shore
and
remarked
that
the
boat
ran
like
a
greyhound
and
it
seemed
to
him
beat
the
old
ocean
steamer
pretty
bad
he
seemed
to
be
nearly
well
again
and
complimented
me
as
the
best
doctor
he
ever
saw
since
he
had
been
sick
i
had
paid
him
all
the
attention
i
could
and
he
gave
me
all
the
praise
i
deserved
now
that
he
was
getting
to
feel
himself
again
at
sacramento
we
changed
to
another
boat
bound
for
marysville
which
place
we
reached
without
special
incident
here
we
invested
in
a
donkey
that
is
we
paid
four
ounces
of
gold
for
him
just
an
ounce
apiece
for
four
of
us
manley
robert
mccloud
lyman
ross
and
john
briggs
we
piled
our
blankets
in
a
pack
upon
the
gentle
donkey
and
added
a
little
tea
and
coffee
dried
beef
and
bread
then
started
for
the
yuba
river
ourselves
on
foot
we
crossed
the
river
at
park
bar
then
went
up
the
ridge
by
way
of
nigger
tent
came
down
to
the
river
again
at
goodyear
bar
then
up
the
stream
to
downieville
this
town
was
named
after
john
downie
a
worthless
drunkard
i
remember
that
he
once
reformed
but
again
and
died
a
drunkard
death
we
found
this
a
lively
mining
town
about
sixty
miles
above
marysville
on
the
north
fork
of
the
yuba
river
and
only
reached
by
a
pack
trail
but
everything
was
flush
here
even
four
aces
the
location
was
a
veritable
for
the
mountains
around
were
very
high
and
some
of
them
wore
their
caps
of
snow
all
summer
particularly
those
on
the
east
the
gold
dust
we
found
here
was
coarser
than
it
was
where
i
worked
before
down
south
on
the
merced
river
before
i
came
to
california
i
always
supposed
that
gold
dust
was
really
dust
and
about
as
fine
as
flour
we
went
up
the
north
fork
about
a
mile
or
two
above
town
and
camped
on
wisconsin
flat
to
begin
our
mining
operations
our
luck
was
poor
at
first
and
all
except
myself
were
out
of
money
and
more
or
less
in
debt
to
me
we
made
expenses
however
and
a
little
more
and
as
soon
as
ross
got
his
small
debt
paid
he
said
he
was
discouraged
mining
and
with
blankets
on
his
shoulders
started
up
the
trail
towards
galloway
ranch
on
the
summit
south
of
town
ross
said
the
work
was
too
hard
for
him
for
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
handle
pick
and
shovel
and
he
believed
he
could
go
down
to
sacramento
and
make
more
by
his
wits
than
he
could
here
i
went
with
him
to
town
and
saw
him
start
off
with
a
fair
load
on
his
back
and
watched
him
as
he
toiled
up
the
steep
mountain
trail
for
about
two
miles
when
he
went
out
of
sight
the
rest
of
us
kept
on
mining
our
luck
was
not
very
good
but
we
persevered
for
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
fainting
by
the
way
i
went
into
an
old
abandoned
shaft
about
ten
feet
deep
and
found
the
bottom
filled
with
a
big
quartz
boulder
and
as
i
had
been
a
lead
miner
in
wisconsin
i
began
drifting
and
soon
found
bed
rock
when
i
picked
up
a
piece
of
pure
gold
that
weighed
four
ounces
this
was
what
i
called
a
pretty
big
find
and
not
exactly
what
i
called
gold
dust
it
was
quite
a
surprise
to
me
for
the
gravel
on
the
bed
rock
was
only
about
three
or
four
inches
thick
we
kept
on
drifting
for
some
time
sometimes
making
good
wages
and
on
the
whole
so
satisfactory
that
we
concluded
to
stay
we
now
located
some
claims
back
in
the
flat
where
the
ground
would
be
thirty
feet
deep
and
would
have
to
be
drifted
these
we
managed
to
hold
until
winter
and
in
the
meantime
we
worked
along
the
river
and
could
make
something
all
the
time
we
put
in
a
flume
between
two
falls
on
the
middle
fork
but
made
only
wages
and
i
got
my
arm
nearly
broken
and
had
to
work
with
one
hand
for
nearly
a
month
one
afternoon
i
went
crevicing
up
the
river
and
found
a
crevice
at
the
water
edge
about
half
an
inch
wide
and
the
next
day
we
worked
it
out
getting
forty
ounces
and
many
of
the
pieces
were
about
an
inch
long
and
as
large
around
as
a
winter
was
now
near
by
and
we
set
to
work
to
build
a
cabin
and
lay
in
a
stock
of
grub
which
cost
quite
a
good
deal
for
the
flour
which
we
bought
was
worth
twenty
cents
a
pound
and
all
kinds
of
hog
meat
fifty
cents
with
other
supplies
in
proportion
our
new
claims
now
paid
very
well
snow
came
down
to
the
depth
of
about
four
feet
around
our
cabin
but
as
our
work
was
under
ground
we
had
a
comfortable
place
all
winter
in
the
spring
mccloud
and
i
went
to
sacramento
and
sold
our
chunks
of
gold
it
was
all
very
coarse
to
page
bacon
who
were
themselves
surprised
at
the
coarseness
of
the
whole
lot
when
our
savings
were
weighed
up
we
found
we
had
made
half
an
ounce
a
day
clear
of
all
expenses
for
the
entire
year
we
now
took
a
little
run
down
to
san
francisco
also
to
santa
clara
where
we
staid
a
night
or
two
with
mccloud
friend
otterson
and
then
went
back
to
our
claims
again
in
taking
care
of
our
money
we
had
to
be
our
own
bankers
and
the
usual
way
was
to
put
the
slugs
we
received
for
pay
into
a
gallon
pickle
jar
and
bury
this
in
some
place
known
only
to
our
particular
selves
and
these
vaults
we
considered
perfectly
safe
the
slugs
were
fifty
dollar
pieces
coined
for
convenience
and
were
heavy
pieces
in
the
western
counties
the
people
called
them
adobies
but
among
the
miners
they
were
universally
known
as
slugs
the
winter
proved
a
little
lonesome
the
miners
mostly
staid
at
home
and
worked
during
the
year
we
had
been
here
i
had
not
seen
a
respectable
woman
in
this
mining
country
there
were
few
females
here
and
they
were
said
to
be
of
very
doubtful
character
as
a
general
thing
people
were
very
patient
with
their
wickedness
but
not
always
twice
only
in
the
history
of
california
were
women
made
the
victims
of
mob
violence
once
at
los
angeles
and
once
at
downieville
the
affair
at
the
place
occurred
in
and
the
victim
was
a
pretty
little
spanish
woman
named
juanita
she
and
her
husband
like
many
another
couple
at
that
time
kept
a
monte
game
for
the
delectation
of
the
miners
who
had
more
money
than
sense
but
beyond
this
fact
absolutely
nothing
was
said
against
her
character
there
was
an
english
miner
named
cannon
living
in
town
who
was
very
popular
among
a
large
number
of
gamblers
and
others
he
got
drunk
one
night
and
about
midnight
went
to
the
house
occupied
by
the
spanish
woman
and
her
husband
and
kicked
the
door
down
early
the
following
morning
he
told
his
comrades
that
he
was
going
to
apologize
to
the
woman
for
what
he
had
done
he
went
alone
to
the
house
and
while
talking
with
the
husband
and
wife
the
woman
suddenly
drew
a
knife
and
stabbed
cannon
to
the
heart
what
had
been
said
that
provoked
the
deed
was
never
known
further
than
that
juanita
claimed
she
had
been
grossly
insulted
she
was
given
a
mock
trial
but
the
facts
of
the
case
were
not
brought
out
as
the
men
who
were
with
cannon
were
too
drunk
to
remember
what
had
happened
the
previous
night
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
poor
woman
was
to
be
hanged
and
the
leaders
of
the
mob
would
brook
no
interference
a
physician
examined
juanita
and
announced
to
the
mob
that
she
was
in
a
condition
that
demanded
the
highest
sympathy
of
every
man
but
he
was
forced
to
flee
from
town
to
save
his
life
a
prominent
citizen
made
an
appeal
for
mercy
but
he
was
driven
down
the
main
street
and
across
the
river
by
a
mob
with
drawn
revolvers
and
with
threats
of
instant
death
the
john
weller
was
in
town
at
the
time
and
was
asked
to
reason
with
the
mob
but
refused
to
do
so
the
execution
was
promptly
carried
out
a
plank
was
put
across
the
supports
of
the
bridge
over
the
yuba
and
a
rope
fastened
to
a
beam
overhead
juanita
went
calmly
to
her
death
she
wore
a
panama
hat
and
after
mounting
the
platform
she
removed
it
tossed
it
to
a
friend
in
the
crowd
whose
nickname
was
oregon
with
the
remark
adios
amigo
then
she
adjusted
the
noose
to
her
own
neck
raising
her
long
loose
tresses
carefully
in
order
to
fix
the
rope
firmly
in
its
place
and
then
with
a
smile
and
wave
of
her
hand
to
the
bloodthirsty
crowd
present
she
stepped
calmly
from
the
plank
into
eternity
singular
enough
her
body
rests
side
by
side
in
the
cemetery
on
the
hill
with
that
of
the
man
whose
life
she
had
taken
on
sundays
downieville
was
full
of
men
none
very
old
and
none
very
young
but
almost
every
one
of
middle
age
nearly
every
man
was
coarsely
dressed
with
beard
unshaved
and
many
with
long
hair
but
on
any
occasion
of
excitement
it
was
not
at
all
strange
to
see
the
coarsest
roughest
looking
one
of
all
the
party
mount
a
stump
and
deliver
as
eloquent
an
address
as
one
could
wish
to
hear
on
sunday
it
was
not
at
all
unusual
for
some
preacher
to
address
the
moving
crowd
while
a
few
feet
behind
him
would
be
a
saloon
in
full
blast
and
drinking
gambling
swearing
and
vulgar
language
could
be
plainly
seen
and
heard
at
the
same
time
and
this
class
of
people
seemed
to
respect
the
sunday
preacher
very
little
the
big
saloon
was
owned
by
john
craycroft
formerly
a
mate
on
a
mississippi
river
steamboat
who
gained
most
of
his
money
by
marrying
a
spanish
woman
and
making
her
a
silent
partner
one
enterprising
man
who
was
anxious
to
make
money
easily
took
a
notion
to
try
his
luck
in
trade
so
as
rats
and
mice
were
troublesome
in
shops
and
stores
he
went
down
to
the
valley
and
brought
up
a
cargo
of
cats
which
he
disposed
of
at
prices
varying
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
dollars
each
according
to
the
buyer
fancy
during
the
summer
kelley
the
fiddler
came
up
in
the
mines
to
make
a
raise
and
craycroft
made
him
a
pulpit
about
ten
feet
above
the
floor
in
his
saloon
having
him
to
play
nights
and
sundays
at
twenty
dollars
per
day
he
was
a
big
uneducated
irishman
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
but
he
played
and
sang
and
talked
the
rich
irish
brogue
all
of
which
brought
many
customers
to
the
bar
in
the
saloon
could
be
seen
all
sorts
of
people
dealing
different
games
and
some
were
said
to
be
preachers
kelley
staid
here
as
long
as
he
could
live
on
his
salary
and
left
town
much
in
debt
for
whiskey
and
cards
got
all
his
money
one
of
the
grocers
kept
out
a
sign
cheap
john
the
packer
and
kept
a
mule
to
deliver
goods
which
no
other
merchant
did
and
in
this
way
gained
many
friends
and
many
now
may
praise
the
enterprise
of
cheap
john
the
packer
prices
were
pretty
high
in
those
days
sharpening
picks
cost
fifty
cents
a
drink
of
whiskey
one
dollar
and
all
kinds
of
pork
fifty
cents
per
pound
you
could
get
meals
at
the
mcnutty
house
for
one
dollar
the
faro
and
monte
banks
absorbed
so
much
of
the
small
change
that
on
one
occasion
i
had
to
pay
five
dollars
for
a
two
dollar
pair
of
pants
in
order
to
get
a
fifty
dollar
slug
changed
no
white
shirts
were
worn
by
honest
men
and
if
any
man
appeared
in
such
a
garment
he
was
at
once
set
down
as
a
gambler
and
with
very
little
chance
of
a
mistake
one
langdon
had
the
only
express
office
and
brought
letters
and
packages
from
sacramento
i
paid
one
dollar
simply
to
get
my
name
on
his
letter
list
and
when
a
letter
came
i
had
to
pay
one
dollar
for
bringing
it
up
as
there
was
no
post
office
at
downieville
newspapers
were
eagerly
sought
for
such
was
the
hunger
for
reading
the
western
folks
bought
the
louis
papers
while
eastern
people
found
the
new
york
tribune
a
favorite
one
dollar
each
for
such
papers
was
the
regular
price
it
may
seem
strange
but
aside
from
the
news
we
got
from
an
occasional
newspaper
i
did
not
hear
a
word
from
the
east
during
the
two
years
i
remained
on
yuba
river
our
evenings
were
spent
in
playing
cards
for
amusement
for
no
reading
could
be
got
the
snow
between
marysville
and
downieville
was
deep
and
impassable
in
winter
but
we
could
work
our
drifting
claims
very
comfortably
having
laid
in
a
stock
of
provisions
early
in
the
season
before
snowfall
the
nights
seemed
tediously
long
and
lonesome
for
when
the
snow
was
deep
no
one
came
to
visit
us
and
we
could
go
nowhere
being
completely
hemmed
in
all
the
miners
who
did
not
have
claims
they
could
work
underground
went
down
below
the
winter
to
find
work
and
when
the
snow
went
off
came
back
again
and
took
possession
of
the
old
claims
they
had
left
after
the
snow
went
off
three
german
sailors
came
up
and
took
a
river
claim
a
short
distance
above
us
on
a
north
fork
of
the
north
fork
of
the
stream
where
one
side
of
the
cañon
was
perpendicular
and
the
other
sloped
back
only
slightly
here
they
put
logs
across
the
river
laid
stringers
on
these
and
covered
the
bottom
with
fir
boughs
then
they
put
stakes
at
the
sides
and
rigged
a
canvas
flume
over
their
bridge
through
which
they
turned
the
whole
current
of
the
river
leaving
a
nearly
dry
bed
beneath
this
we
called
pretty
good
engineering
and
management
on
the
part
of
the
sailor
boys
for
no
lumber
was
to
be
had
and
they
had
made
themselves
masters
of
the
situation
with
the
material
on
hand
they
went
to
work
under
their
log
aqueduct
and
found
the
claim
very
rich
in
coarse
gold
they
went
to
town
every
saturday
night
with
good
big
bags
of
dust
and
as
they
were
fellows
believing
that
a
sailor
always
has
the
best
of
luck
they
played
cards
freely
always
betting
on
the
jack
and
queen
and
spent
their
money
more
easily
than
they
earned
it
they
were
quite
partial
to
the
ladies
and
patronizing
the
bar
and
card
tables
as
liberally
as
they
did
usually
returned
to
camp
on
monday
or
tuesday
with
a
mule
load
of
grub
and
whiskey
as
all
the
visible
proceeds
of
a
week
successful
mining
but
when
saturday
night
came
around
again
we
were
pretty
sure
to
see
the
jolly
sailors
going
past
with
heavy
bags
of
gold
they
left
one
nearly
pure
piece
of
gold
at
langdon
express
office
that
weighed
five
pounds
and
another
as
large
as
a
man
hand
of
the
shape
of
a
prickly
pear
leaf
they
worked
their
claim
with
good
success
until
the
snow
water
came
down
and
forced
them
out
i
went
one
day
to
see
them
and
they
took
a
pan
of
dirt
from
behind
a
big
rock
and
washed
it
out
getting
as
much
as
two
teacupfuls
of
nuggets
worth
perhaps
a
thousand
dollars
when
they
went
away
they
said
they
would
go
to
germany
to
see
their
poor
relatives
and
friends
and
one
of
them
really
went
home
but
the
other
two
had
spent
all
their
money
before
they
were
ready
to
leave
san
francisco
these
men
were
without
doubt
the
inventors
of
the
canvas
flume
which
was
afterward
used
so
successfully
in
various
places
while
i
was
still
here
the
now
famous
downieville
butte
quartz
mine
was
discovered
but
there
was
no
way
then
of
working
quartz
successfully
and
just
at
that
time
very
little
was
done
with
it
but
afterward
when
it
was
learned
how
to
work
it
and
the
proper
machinery
introduced
it
yielded
large
sums
of
bullion
the
miners
had
a
queer
way
of
calling
every
man
by
some
nickname
or
other
instead
of
his
true
name
and
no
one
seemed
offended
at
it
but
answered
to
his
new
name
as
readily
as
to
any
it
was
nearly
fall
when
we
found
we
had
worked
our
claims
out
and
there
were
no
new
ones
we
could
locate
here
so
we
concluded
to
go
prospecting
for
a
new
locality
i
bought
a
donkey
in
town
of
a
hawley
a
merchant
for
which
i
paid
sixty
dollars
and
gave
the
little
fellow
his
old
master
name
we
now
had
two
animals
and
we
packed
on
them
our
worldly
goods
and
started
south
up
the
mountain
trail
by
way
of
the
city
of
six
where
some
half
dozen
men
had
located
claims
but
the
ground
was
dry
and
deep
so
we
went
on
we
still
went
south
down
toward
the
middle
yuba
river
and
when
about
half
way
down
the
mountain
side
came
to
a
sort
of
level
bench
where
some
miners
were
at
work
but
hardly
any
water
could
be
had
they
called
this
minnesota
we
stayed
here
a
day
or
two
but
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
possible
further
development
of
water
concluded
to
go
on
further
across
the
river
we
could
see
a
little
flat
very
similar
to
the
one
we
were
on
and
a
little
prospecting
seemed
to
have
been
done
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
we
had
a
terribly
steep
cañon
to
cross
and
a
river
also
with
no
trail
to
follow
but
our
donkeys
were
as
good
climbers
as
any
of
us
so
we
started
down
the
mountain
in
the
morning
and
arrived
at
the
river
about
noon
here
we
rested
an
hour
or
two
and
then
began
climbing
the
brushy
mountain
side
the
hill
was
very
steep
and
the
sun
beat
down
on
us
with
all
his
heat
so
that
with
our
hard
labor
and
the
absence
of
any
wind
we
found
it
a
pretty
hot
place
it
was
pretty
risky
traveling
in
some
places
and
we
had
to
help
the
donkeys
to
keep
them
from
rolling
down
the
hill
pack
and
all
it
took
us
four
hours
to
make
a
mile
and
a
half
or
two
miles
in
that
dense
brush
and
we
were
nearly
choked
when
we
reached
the
little
flat
here
we
found
some
water
but
no
one
lived
here
from
here
we
could
see
a
large
flat
across
a
deep
cañon
to
the
west
and
made
up
our
minds
to
try
to
go
to
it
we
went
around
the
head
of
the
cañon
and
worked
through
the
brush
and
fallen
timber
reaching
our
objective
point
just
as
night
was
coming
on
this
flat
like
the
one
we
had
left
was
quite
level
and
contained
perhaps
nearly
one
hundred
acres
here
we
found
two
men
at
work
with
a
long
tom
a
fernay
and
a
bloat
they
had
brought
the
water
of
a
small
spring
to
their
claim
and
were
making
five
or
six
dollars
per
day
we
now
prospected
around
the
edge
of
this
flat
and
getting
pretty
fair
prospects
concluded
we
would
locate
here
if
we
could
get
water
we
then
began
our
search
for
water
and
found
a
spring
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
away
to
which
we
laid
claim
and
with
a
triangle
level
began
to
survey
out
a
route
for
our
ditch
the
survey
was
satisfactory
and
we
found
we
could
bring
the
water
out
high
on
the
flat
so
we
set
to
work
digging
at
it
and
turned
the
water
in
the
ground
was
so
very
dry
that
all
the
water
soaked
up
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
spring
by
this
time
we
were
out
of
grub
and
some
one
must
go
for
a
new
supply
and
as
we
knew
the
trail
to
downieville
was
terribly
rough
i
was
chosen
as
the
one
to
try
to
find
nevada
city
which
we
thought
would
be
nearer
and
more
easily
reached
so
i
started
south
with
the
donkeys
up
the
mountain
toward
the
ridge
which
lies
between
the
middle
and
south
yuba
rivers
and
when
i
got
well
on
the
ridge
i
found
a
trail
used
some
by
wagons
which
i
followed
till
i
came
to
a
place
where
the
ridge
was
only
wide
enough
for
a
wagon
and
at
the
west
end
a
faint
trail
turned
off
south
into
the
rolling
hills
i
thought
this
went
about
the
course
i
wanted
to
go
so
i
followed
it
and
after
two
or
three
miles
came
to
the
south
yuba
river
this
seemed
to
be
an
indian
trail
no
other
signs
on
it
i
climbed
the
mountain
here
and
when
i
reached
the
top
i
found
a
large
tent
made
of
blue
drilling
and
here
i
found
i
was
four
or
five
miles
from
nevada
city
with
a
good
trail
to
follow
the
rolling
hills
i
then
passed
through
are
now
called
north
bloomfield
and
at
one
time
were
known
as
humbug
i
started
along
the
trail
and
soon
reached
the
city
where
i
drove
my
donkeys
up
to
a
store
which
had
out
the
sign
davis
i
entered
and
inquiring
the
prices
of
various
sorts
of
provisions
such
as
flour
bacon
beans
butter
soon
had
selected
enough
for
two
donkey
loads
they
assisted
me
in
putting
them
in
pack
and
when
it
was
ready
i
asked
the
amount
of
my
bill
which
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
this
i
paid
at
once
and
they
gave
me
some
crackers
and
dried
beef
for
lunch
on
the
way
davis
said
that
is
the
quickest
sale
i
ever
made
and
here
the
man
is
ready
to
go
i
defy
any
one
to
beat
it
before
sun
down
i
was
two
or
three
miles
on
my
way
back
where
i
found
some
grass
and
camped
for
the
night
picketed
the
animals
ate
some
of
grub
for
supper
and
arranged
a
bed
of
saddle
blankets
i
arrived
at
camp
the
next
day
about
sun
down
next
day
i
went
on
up
the
divide
and
found
a
house
on
the
trail
leading
farther
east
where
two
men
lived
but
they
seemed
to
be
doing
nothing
there
were
no
mines
and
miners
near
there
and
there
seemed
to
be
very
little
travel
on
the
trail
the
fellows
looked
rough
and
i
suspected
they
might
be
bad
characters
the
stream
they
lived
near
was
afterward
called
bloody
run
and
there
were
stories
current
that
blood
had
been
shed
there
here
was
a
section
of
comparatively
level
land
for
the
mountain
divide
and
a
fine
spring
of
good
cold
water
all
surrounded
by
several
hundred
acres
of
the
most
magnificent
sugar
pines
california
ever
raised
very
large
straight
as
a
candle
and
one
hundred
feet
or
more
to
the
lowest
limbs
this
place
was
afterward
called
snow
tent
and
churchill
built
a
sawmill
at
the
spring
and
had
all
this
fine
timber
at
the
mercy
of
his
ax
and
saw
without
anyone
to
dispute
his
right
he
furnished
lumber
to
the
miners
at
fifty
dollars
or
more
per
thousand
feet
bloody
run
no
doubt
well
deserves
its
name
for
there
was
much
talk
of
killing
done
there
i
however
went
up
and
talked
to
the
men
and
told
them
i
wished
to
hire
a
cross
cut
saw
for
a
few
days
to
get
out
stuff
for
a
cabin
and
agreed
to
pay
two
dollars
a
day
for
the
use
of
it
till
it
came
back
we
cut
down
a
large
sugar
pine
cut
off
four
six
feet
cuts
one
twelve
feet
and
one
sixteen
feet
cut
and
from
these
we
split
out
a
lot
of
boards
which
we
used
to
make
a
flume
which
we
placed
in
our
ditch
and
thus
got
the
water
through
we
split
the
longer
cuts
into
two
inch
plank
for
sluice
boxes
and
made
a
small
reservoir
so
that
we
succeeded
in
working
the
ground
we
paid
wages
to
the
two
men
who
worked
and
two
other
men
who
were
with
us
went
and
built
a
cabin
i
now
went
and
got
another
load
of
provisions
and
as
the
snow
could
be
seen
on
the
high
mountains
to
the
east
i
thought
the
deer
must
be
crowded
down
to
our
country
so
i
went
out
hunting
and
killed
a
big
fat
buck
and
the
next
day
three
more
so
fresh
meat
was
plenty
about
this
time
a
man
came
down
the
mountain
with
his
oxen
and
wagon
wife
and
three
or
four
children
the
eldest
a
young
lady
of
fifteen
years
the
man
name
was
moore
we
had
posted
notices
according
to
custom
to
make
mining
laws
and
had
quite
a
discussion
about
a
name
for
the
place
some
of
the
fellows
wanted
to
name
it
after
the
young
lady
minda
flat
but
we
finally
chose
moore
flat
instead
which
i
believe
is
the
name
it
still
goes
by
our
laws
were
soon
completed
and
a
recorder
chosen
to
record
claims
we
gave
moore
the
honor
of
having
a
prospecting
town
named
after
him
because
he
was
the
first
man
to
be
on
hand
with
a
wife
i
became
satisfied
after
a
little
that
this
place
would
be
a
very
snowy
place
and
that
from
all
appearances
it
would
fall
from
two
to
four
feet
deep
and
not
a
very
pleasant
place
to
winter
in
an
honest
acquaintance
of
mine
came
along
samuel
tyler
and
to
him
i
let
my
claim
to
work
on
shares
and
made
mccloud
my
agent
verbally
while
i
took
my
blankets
and
started
for
the
valley
the
first
town
i
passed
through
was
a
newly
discovered
mining
town
called
french
corral
here
i
found
an
old
wisconsin
friend
wm
sublet
the
foster
father
of
the
accomplishen
wife
of
mayor
boring
of
san
jose
from
here
i
went
to
marysville
the
storm
had
been
raging
high
in
the
mountains
for
some
days
and
the
yuba
river
rising
fast
overflowing
its
banks
as
i
walked
into
town
and
the
next
day
the
merchants
were
very
busy
piling
their
goods
above
high
water
mark
i
went
to
a
hotel
and
called
for
a
bed
yes
says
the
landlord
is
your
name
john
or
peter
i
told
him
william
which
he
set
down
in
his
book
and
we
went
up
stairs
to
the
best
room
which
was
fitted
up
with
berths
three
tiers
high
on
each
side
and
only
one
or
two
empty
ones
he
looked
around
for
covers
but
none
could
be
found
unoccupied
but
one
fellow
who
was
sound
asleep
and
snoring
awfully
so
he
took
the
blanket
off
from
him
saying
he
wont
know
a
thing
about
it
till
morning
be
jabers
so
do
say
a
word
next
morning
the
river
was
booming
its
surface
covered
with
all
sorts
of
mining
outfit
such
as
flume
timber
rockers
various
qualities
of
lumber
pieces
of
trees
as
well
as
whole
ones
water
wheels
and
other
traps
the
river
between
downieville
and
here
must
have
been
swept
clean
of
all
material
that
would
float
including
long
toms
the
water
continued
to
rise
till
it
covered
the
plaza
and
in
two
days
a
steamer
came
up
and
sailed
across
the
public
square
this
looked
like
a
wet
season
to
me
and
when
the
boat
was
ready
to
go
down
the
river
i
went
on
board
bound
for
sacramento
here
it
was
also
getting
terrible
wet
and
muddy
and
the
rain
kept
pouring
down
in
the
morning
i
worked
my
way
up
j
street
and
saw
a
team
wading
up
the
streets
the
driver
on
foot
tramping
through
the
sloppy
mud
occasionally
stepping
in
a
hole
and
falling
his
whole
length
in
the
mud
on
the
street
where
so
much
trouble
was
met
by
the
teamsters
a
lot
of
idlers
stood
on
the
sidewalk
and
when
a
driver
would
fall
and
go
nearly
out
of
sight
they
would
like
a
set
of
loafers
laugh
at
him
and
blackguard
him
with
much
noise
and
as
they
were
numerous
they
feared
nothing
suddenly
a
miner
who
had
lately
arrived
from
the
mountains
raised
his
room
window
in
the
second
story
of
a
house
put
out
one
leg
and
then
his
body
as
far
as
he
could
and
having
nothing
on
but
his
night
clothes
shouted
to
the
noisy
crowd
below
say
ca
you
d
d
farmers
plow
now
at
this
he
dodged
back
quickly
into
his
window
as
if
he
expected
something
might
be
thrown
at
him
the
rain
continued
and
the
water
rose
gradually
till
it
began
to
run
slowly
through
the
streets
and
all
the
business
stopped
except
gambling
and
drinking
whisky
which
were
freely
carried
on
in
the
saloons
day
and
night
while
here
in
sacramento
i
was
sufficiently
prompted
by
curiosity
to
go
around
to
the
place
on
j
street
where
the
legislature
was
in
session
i
stood
sometime
outside
the
enclosure
listening
to
the
members
who
were
in
earnest
debate
over
a
question
concerning
the
size
of
mining
claims
they
wanted
them
uniform
in
size
all
over
the
state
but
there
was
some
opposition
and
the
debate
on
this
occasion
was
between
the
members
from
the
mining
counties
on
one
side
and
the
cow
counties
on
the
other
the
miners
took
the
ground
that
the
claims
were
of
different
richness
in
the
different
mining
localities
and
that
the
miners
themselves
were
the
best
judges
of
the
proper
size
of
claims
and
were
abundantly
able
to
make
their
own
laws
as
they
had
done
under
the
present
mining
customs
and
their
laws
had
always
been
respected
making
any
further
legislative
action
unnecessary
while
this
wrangle
was
going
on
capt
hunt
of
san
bernardino
our
guide
from
salt
lake
in
came
along
and
stopped
where
i
stood
shaking
me
heartily
by
the
hand
inquiring
where
i
was
from
and
when
i
told
him
i
was
from
the
mines
he
said
he
thought
the
cow
county
fellows
were
trying
to
make
the
miners
some
trouble
i
told
him
the
present
mining
regulations
suited
us
very
well
and
after
he
had
talked
with
me
a
little
he
went
inside
and
whispered
to
some
of
the
silent
members
that
the
miners
wanted
no
change
for
he
had
just
consulted
a
miner
to
that
effect
when
occasion
offered
he
called
for
a
vote
which
resulted
in
the
defeat
of
the
cow
counties
and
a
postponement
of
the
measure
indefinitely
my
next
move
was
to
try
to
find
a
dryer
place
so
i
took
a
boat
for
benicia
then
for
stockton
where
i
found
a
sea
of
mud
so
that
a
man
needed
stilts
or
a
boat
to
cross
the
street
here
in
a
livery
stable
i
found
my
old
platte
river
boss
chas
dallas
for
whom
i
drove
in
but
he
did
not
seem
to
know
me
and
took
no
notice
of
me
but
talked
horse
and
to
the
bystanders
very
loudly
i
suppose
that
dallas
had
made
money
and
did
not
care
for
a
poor
ox
driver
and
on
my
part
i
did
not
care
very
much
for
his
friendship
so
i
walked
away
and
left
him
without
a
word
every
way
i
looked
was
a
sea
of
black
sticky
mud
dogs
mired
in
the
streets
and
died
and
teams
and
animals
had
forsaken
the
usual
route
of
travel
the
gambling
houses
and
saloons
were
crowded
gum
boots
in
demand
and
the
only
way
to
get
out
of
town
was
by
water
i
took
this
way
out
and
on
the
same
boat
by
which
i
came
going
to
san
francisco
this
was
high
and
dry
enough
to
be
above
the
highest
floods
of
yuba
sacramento
or
san
joaquin
but
all
business
except
the
saloons
was
dull
fronting
on
portsmouth
square
was
the
hall
of
corruption
inside
was
a
magnificently
furnished
bar
more
than
one
keeper
and
various
gambling
tables
most
of
them
with
soiled
doves
in
attendance
the
room
was
thronged
with
players
and
spectators
and
coin
and
dust
were
plenty
the
dealers
drew
off
their
cards
carefully
and
seemed
to
have
the
largest
pile
of
coin
on
their
side
i
climbed
russian
hill
and
to
take
a
look
over
the
city
it
seemed
poorly
built
but
the
portion
that
had
been
burned
in
july
had
been
built
up
again
the
business
part
was
near
the
beach
and
north
of
market
street
i
had
never
lived
in
a
town
and
did
not
know
its
ways
so
i
strolled
around
alone
for
without
acquaintance
i
did
not
know
where
to
go
nor
what
to
look
for
i
therefore
thought
i
would
see
some
other
part
of
the
country
i
found
that
a
schooner
was
about
to
sail
for
san
pedro
near
los
angeles
i
took
hold
of
a
rope
to
help
myself
on
board
when
it
gave
way
and
i
found
myself
floundering
in
the
water
they
helped
me
out
and
the
captain
gave
me
a
dry
suit
to
put
on
i
was
profoundly
grateful
for
the
favor
and
found
him
a
generous
man
we
sailed
away
and
stopped
at
monterey
for
hours
which
gave
me
a
good
chance
for
a
good
look
at
the
old
capitol
houses
which
were
of
adobe
and
to
find
that
this
city
was
also
liberally
supplied
with
gambling
card
and
billiard
tables
the
majority
of
the
people
were
spanish
and
fond
of
gaming
and
the
general
appearance
of
the
place
was
old
and
without
good
improvements
though
there
were
more
houses
than
in
most
places
in
california
some
houses
were
of
stone
but
more
of
adobe
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
fertile
country
round
and
the
hills
about
had
small
pines
on
them
some
of
the
sailors
went
out
and
gathered
a
large
bag
of
mussels
and
clams
from
which
they
made
a
liberal
allowance
of
chowder
for
the
table
after
seven
or
eight
days
we
arrived
in
san
pedro
and
found
the
town
to
consist
of
one
long
adobe
house
the
beach
was
low
and
sandy
and
we
were
wet
somewhat
in
wading
through
a
light
surf
to
get
on
shore
we
had
on
board
a
baylis
who
we
afterward
learned
came
down
with
capt
lackey
on
a
big
speculation
which
was
to
capture
all
the
wild
goats
they
could
on
catalina
island
and
take
them
to
san
francisco
for
slaughtering
the
goats
were
easily
captured
and
taken
on
board
the
schooner
and
thence
to
shore
but
many
were
drowned
in
the
transit
and
when
driven
to
san
francisco
the
dead
were
scattered
all
along
the
route
although
wild
they
seemed
to
lack
the
vitality
that
tame
goats
possess
the
speculation
proved
a
disappointment
to
the
projectors
at
the
adobe
house
kept
by
a
spaniard
we
had
breakfast
then
shouldered
our
packs
for
the
march
of
ten
leagues
to
los
angeles
for
there
was
no
chance
to
ride
it
was
night
before
we
reached
the
city
of
angels
and
here
i
staid
a
day
to
take
a
look
at
the
first
city
i
saw
in
california
in
march
i
inquired
for
my
mining
companion
stockton
who
worked
with
bennett
and
myself
near
georgetown
in
and
found
he
lived
near
the
old
mission
of
san
gabriel
nine
miles
away
whither
i
walked
and
found
him
and
family
well
and
glad
to
see
me
he
had
jumped
an
old
pear
orchard
which
was
not
claimed
by
the
mission
fathers
although
it
was
only
of
a
mile
away
the
trees
were
all
seedlings
and
very
large
probably
or
more
years
old
some
of
the
mission
buildings
were
falling
down
since
they
had
been
abandoned
and
the
americans
would
go
to
these
houses
and
remove
the
tile
flooring
from
the
porches
and
from
the
pillars
that
supported
them
these
tiles
were
of
hard
burned
clay
in
pieces
about
a
foot
square
and
were
very
convenient
to
make
fire
places
and
pavements
before
the
doors
of
their
new
houses
the
enclosed
orange
and
fig
orchard
at
this
place
were
some
large
olive
and
fig
trees
apparently
as
old
as
the
mission
being
a
foot
or
more
in
diameter
and
about
feet
high
i
had
never
seen
olives
and
when
i
saw
these
trees
covered
with
plenty
of
fruit
about
the
size
of
damson
plums
i
took
the
liberty
of
tasting
it
and
found
it
very
disagreeable
and
wondered
of
what
use
such
fruit
could
be
stockton
fenced
his
orchard
by
setting
posts
and
tying
sycamore
poles
to
them
to
keep
the
stock
away
built
an
adobe
house
on
the
claim
and
called
the
property
his
i
went
to
work
for
him
at
once
pruning
the
trees
which
improved
their
appearance
and
then
turned
on
a
little
stream
of
water
which
ran
through
the
place
and
on
down
to
the
mission
with
this
treatment
the
trees
did
well
without
cultivation
i
bought
one
half
the
stock
consisting
of
some
spanish
cows
one
yoke
of
oxen
and
some
horses
worked
enough
to
pay
my
board
watched
the
stock
and
still
had
plenty
of
time
to
ride
around
over
the
adjoining
country
when
the
pears
were
ripe
the
spanish
men
women
and
children
eagerly
bought
them
at
cents
per
dozen
and
some
sundays
the
receipts
for
fruit
sold
would
be
as
high
as
that
taken
to
town
would
bring
from
to
per
box
the
boxes
being
a
little
larger
than
those
in
present
use
an
indian
woman
widow
of
a
reed
claimed
a
vineyard
near
the
orchard
and
laid
claim
to
the
whole
property
so
stockton
gave
her
for
a
quit
claim
deed
near
by
was
a
small
artificial
lake
made
by
a
dam
of
cobble
stones
laid
in
cement
across
a
ravine
which
was
built
perhaps
years
before
and
yet
the
tracks
of
a
child
who
had
walked
across
before
the
cement
was
dry
were
plainly
seen
stockton
and
i
visited
roland
an
old
settler
who
lived
south
of
san
gabriel
river
and
staid
all
night
with
him
finding
him
very
sociable
and
hospitable
all
his
work
was
done
by
indians
who
lived
near
by
and
had
been
there
as
long
as
he
he
had
a
small
vineyard
and
raised
corn
squashes
melons
and
all
that
are
necessary
for
his
table
having
also
a
small
mill
near
by
for
grinding
corn
and
wheat
without
bolting
the
indians
made
his
wine
by
tramping
the
grapes
with
their
feet
in
a
rawhide
vat
hung
between
four
poles
set
in
the
ground
the
workmen
were
paid
off
every
saturday
night
and
during
sunday
he
would
generally
sell
them
wine
enough
to
get
about
all
the
money
back
again
this
had
been
his
practice
for
many
years
and
no
doubt
suited
roland
as
well
as
the
red
men
roland
was
an
old
rocky
mountain
trapper
who
came
to
california
long
before
gold
was
discovered
and
during
the
evening
the
talk
naturally
ran
to
the
subject
of
early
days
roland
related
that
while
his
party
were
in
camp
in
the
upper
colorado
they
were
visited
by
a
small
band
of
indians
who
professed
friendship
and
seated
themselves
around
the
fire
suddenly
they
made
an
attack
and
each
trapper
had
an
indian
to
contend
with
except
roland
who
was
left
to
be
dispatched
afterwards
but
as
he
ran
a
squaw
among
them
followed
him
and
after
a
while
overtook
him
and
showed
friendship
he
had
neither
gun
or
knife
and
so
concluded
to
put
faith
in
the
woman
who
safely
guided
him
in
a
long
tramp
across
the
desert
where
they
both
came
near
starving
but
finally
reached
los
angeles
valley
when
the
brave
squaw
mingled
with
her
own
people
and
he
lost
sight
of
her
forever
no
white
man
could
alone
have
traversed
that
desert
waste
and
found
food
enough
to
last
him
half
the
journey
he
gradually
learned
to
speak
spanish
and
was
granted
the
piece
of
land
he
applied
for
and
where
he
then
lived
married
a
spanish
girl
with
whom
he
had
a
happy
home
and
raised
a
large
family
and
grew
rich
for
they
were
both
industrious
and
economical
the
first
wife
died
and
he
was
persuaded
to
marry
a
texas
widow
and
now
had
to
buy
the
first
carriage
he
ever
owned
and
furnish
a
fine
and
driver
for
the
lady
who
wore
much
jewelry
and
fine
clothes
and
spent
money
freely
roland
was
not
a
society
man
his
thoughts
and
habits
were
different
from
his
wife
and
he
staid
at
home
better
contented
there
there
were
many
other
pioneers
in
the
neighborhood
dan
sexton
williams
of
chino
ranch
workman
wilson
abel
stearns
temple
wolfskill
and
many
others
scott
and
granger
were
lawyers
granger
was
the
same
man
who
read
the
preamble
and
resolutions
that
were
to
govern
our
big
train
as
we
were
about
to
start
from
utah
lake
scott
was
quite
a
noted
member
of
the
bar
and
when
winfield
scott
ran
for
president
some
wide
awake
politicians
caused
the
uneducated
spaniards
to
vote
for
their
favorite
lawyer
instead
of
the
redoubtable
general
and
they
did
this
with
a
good
will
for
they
thought
the
famous
avocado
was
the
best
man
and
thus
the
manipulators
lost
many
votes
to
the
real
candidate
scott
was
afterward
retained
by
many
of
the
spaniards
to
present
their
claims
for
their
land
to
the
government
and
was
considered
a
very
able
man
stockton
related
that
when
he
left
his
family
here
to
go
to
the
mines
he
rented
one
half
a
house
of
michael
blanco
who
had
a
spanish
wife
and
children
and
these
and
his
own
were
of
course
constant
playmates
when
he
returned
in
the
fall
he
found
his
children
had
learned
to
speak
spanish
and
nearly
forgotten
english
so
that
he
had
to
coax
them
a
great
deal
to
get
them
to
talk
to
him
at
all
and
he
could
not
understand
a
word
they
said
i
now
tried
to
learn
the
language
myself
i
had
money
to
loan
and
the
borrowers
were
spanish
who
gave
good
security
and
paid
from
to
per
cent
interest
per
month
on
short
time
stockton
assisted
me
very
much
as
an
interpreter
i
bought
young
steers
for
each
and
gradually
added
to
my
herd
i
got
along
well
until
next
spring
when
the
beef
eating
population
began
to
steal
my
fat
cattle
and
seemed
determined
i
should
get
no
richer
the
country
was
with
desperate
and
lawless
renegades
in
los
angeles
and
from
one
to
four
dead
men
was
about
the
number
picked
up
in
the
streets
each
morning
they
were
of
low
class
and
there
was
no
investigation
simply
a
burial
at
public
expense
the
permanent
spanish
population
seemed
honest
and
benevolent
but
there
were
many
bad
ones
from
chili
sonora
mexico
texas
utah
and
europe
who
seemed
always
on
an
errand
of
mischief
a
murder
thieving
or
robbery
three
or
four
suspicious
looking
men
came
on
horseback
and
made
their
camp
near
the
mission
under
an
oak
tree
where
they
staid
sometime
they
always
left
someone
in
camp
while
the
others
went
away
every
day
on
their
horses
and
acted
so
strangely
that
the
report
soon
became
current
that
they
were
stealing
horses
and
running
them
off
to
some
safe
place
in
the
mountains
till
a
quantity
could
be
accumulated
to
take
to
the
mines
to
sell
on
this
information
the
vigilance
committee
arrested
the
man
in
camp
and
brought
him
to
a
private
room
where
he
was
tried
by
twelve
men
who
found
him
guilty
of
horse
stealing
and
sentenced
to
be
hung
at
once
for
horse
stealing
was
a
capital
offence
in
those
days
to
carry
out
the
sentence
they
procured
a
cart
put
a
box
on
it
for
a
seat
and
with
a
rope
around
his
neck
and
seated
on
the
box
the
condemned
man
was
dragged
off
by
hand
to
an
oak
tree
not
far
away
whither
he
was
followed
by
all
the
men
women
and
children
of
the
place
who
where
nearly
all
natives
while
preparations
were
being
made
under
the
tree
some
one
called
out
that
men
were
riding
rapidly
from
the
direction
of
los
angeles
and
from
the
dust
they
raised
seemed
to
be
more
than
usually
in
haste
so
it
was
proposed
to
wait
till
they
came
up
it
was
soon
known
that
an
indian
had
been
sent
to
los
angeles
to
give
news
to
the
man
friends
there
and
they
had
come
with
all
the
speed
of
their
horses
to
try
to
save
his
life
they
talked
and
inquired
around
a
little
and
then
proposed
the
question
whether
to
hang
him
or
to
turn
him
over
to
the
lawful
authorities
for
regular
trial
this
was
put
to
a
vote
and
it
was
decided
to
spare
him
now
so
the
rope
was
taken
off
his
neck
and
he
was
turned
over
to
mallard
the
mission
justice
of
the
peace
much
to
the
relief
of
the
fellow
who
saw
death
staring
him
in
the
face
the
santa
anita
ranch
now
owned
by
baldwin
was
owned
by
henry
dalton
an
englishman
who
came
with
a
stock
of
goods
worth
years
before
but
now
had
only
the
ranch
left
the
azuza
a
short
distance
south
was
occupied
by
his
brother
i
became
well
acquainted
with
many
of
these
old
california
natives
and
found
them
honest
in
their
dealings
good
to
the
needy
and
in
all
my
travels
never
found
more
willing
hands
to
bestow
upon
relatives
friends
or
strangers
ready
relief
than
i
saw
among
these
simple
natives
their
kindness
to
our
party
when
we
came
starving
on
the
desert
in
can
never
be
praised
enough
and
as
long
as
i
shall
live
my
best
wishes
shall
go
with
them
i
was
one
day
riding
with
vincent
duarte
down
toward
anaheim
when
he
suddenly
dismounted
to
kill
a
large
tarantula
by
pelting
him
with
stones
it
was
the
first
one
i
had
seen
and
seemed
an
spider
i
asked
him
if
the
thing
was
harmful
and
he
replied
with
considerable
warmth
mucho
malo
por
christianos
and
i
wondered
if
the
insect
knew
saints
from
sinners
this
spring
we
concluded
to
go
to
the
mormon
settlement
at
san
bernardino
and
secure
some
american
bulls
to
improve
our
stock
and
starting
late
one
day
i
rode
as
far
as
the
azuza
rancho
where
i
staid
all
night
with
dalton
reaching
the
holy
city
a
branch
of
brigham
young
harem
next
day
here
i
found
a
town
of
log
houses
in
a
circle
enclosing
a
plaza
there
was
a
passage
between
the
houses
i
stopped
at
the
principal
hotel
kept
by
a
vigorous
and
enthusiastic
mormon
woman
who
delighted
to
preach
the
doctrine
walking
around
on
the
outside
of
the
fortifications
i
came
across
capt
hunt
the
man
who
was
hired
in
the
fall
of
to
bring
the
big
train
from
salt
lake
to
san
bernardino
i
told
him
who
i
was
and
what
i
wanted
and
he
seemed
to
know
me
inviting
me
in
the
most
friendly
and
social
manner
to
take
supper
with
him
which
i
did
he
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
introduced
me
to
his
three
wives
the
furnishing
of
the
house
was
cheap
and
common
but
the
table
was
fairly
provided
for
he
said
he
would
help
me
to
find
the
animals
i
wanted
and
in
the
morning
showed
me
two
which
he
had
that
were
young
and
suitable
and
a
larger
one
which
he
said
i
could
have
if
i
could
drive
him
i
soon
found
out
that
i
had
better
move
or
sell
my
cattle
for
with
all
my
watching
i
could
do
they
gradually
disappeared
and
hungry
thieves
who
could
live
on
beef
alone
visited
my
little
band
of
cattle
too
often
and
took
what
they
wanted
and
i
could
not
detect
them
i
soon
sold
to
four
buyers
from
the
north
stevens
david
grant
sam
craig
and
wilson
and
hired
out
with
my
two
horses
to
help
them
drive
the
band
north
at
a
salary
of
per
month
disposing
most
of
my
money
with
palmer
cook
i
went
to
see
my
mine
at
moore
flat
there
were
two
boats
leaving
at
about
the
same
time
one
for
stockton
and
one
for
sacramento
the
latter
of
which
i
took
and
rogers
the
other
both
landed
at
benecia
and
when
we
swung
away
from
that
wharf
rogers
and
i
saluted
each
other
with
raised
and
swinging
hats
shouted
a
good
bye
and
i
have
never
seen
him
since
at
moore
flat
i
found
my
mine
well
and
profitably
worked
by
tyler
and
as
his
lease
was
not
out
i
returned
to
san
jose
as
i
had
learned
from
rogers
that
bennett
was
at
watsonville
and
arcane
at
santa
cruz
and
i
desired
to
visit
them
i
rode
back
across
the
country
and
found
bennett
and
family
at
the
point
where
the
salinas
river
enters
monterey
bay
they
were
all
well
and
were
glad
to
see
me
for
they
did
not
know
i
was
in
california
bennett
was
greatly
affected
at
our
meeting
and
shed
tears
of
joy
as
she
shook
hands
bennett
had
a
nice
whitehall
boat
and
we
had
a
genuine
happy
time
hunting
fishing
and
gathering
clams
and
also
in
social
visits
among
the
neighbors
and
old
acquaintances
among
them
one
jacob
rhodehouse
of
wisconsin
while
here
i
rode
my
horse
around
to
monterey
and
to
carmel
mission
where
i
staid
two
or
three
days
with
gourley
a
brother
of
william
stockton
who
was
here
engaged
in
raising
potatoes
i
walked
along
the
beach
near
some
rocky
islands
near
the
shore
and
on
these
rocks
were
more
sea
lions
and
seals
than
i
supposed
the
whole
ocean
contained
the
most
wonderful
show
of
sea
life
on
the
california
coast
returning
i
staid
all
night
at
the
crossing
of
the
salinas
with
a
colored
family
who
gave
me
good
accommodations
for
self
and
horse
i
heard
afterward
that
this
family
was
attacked
by
robbers
and
all
but
one
murdered
bennett
father
dilley
lived
near
here
also
and
i
had
not
seen
him
since
the
time
in
wisconsin
when
he
hauled
my
canoe
over
to
the
river
in
one
day
while
fishing
on
the
beach
we
found
the
body
of
a
man
which
we
carried
above
the
tide
and
buried
in
the
sand
i
gave
one
of
my
horses
to
geo
bennett
and
went
over
to
santa
cruz
where
i
found
and
arcane
and
son
charles
in
a
comfortable
home
well
situated
and
overjoyed
to
see
me
he
knew
everyone
in
town
and
as
we
went
about
he
never
missed
to
introduce
me
to
every
one
we
met
as
the
man
who
helped
himself
and
family
out
of
death
valley
and
saved
their
lives
arcane
was
a
very
polite
frenchman
and
knew
how
to
manage
such
things
very
gracefully
but
with
all
his
grace
and
heartiness
it
made
me
feel
quite
a
little
embarrassed
to
be
made
so
much
of
publicly
and
among
strangers
he
took
me
in
his
buggy
and
we
drove
along
the
beach
and
to
the
of
cowel
jordan
also
to
the
court
house
when
court
was
in
session
upon
the
hill
i
met
judge
watson
the
father
of
watsonville
and
a
graham
an
old
settler
and
land
owner
and
on
this
occasion
he
pulled
a
sheet
of
ancient
smoky
looking
paper
from
beneath
his
arm
pointed
to
a
dozen
or
so
of
written
lines
in
spanish
and
then
with
a
flourish
of
the
precious
document
in
watson
face
dared
him
to
beat
that
or
get
him
off
his
land
i
must
say
that
never
in
my
life
was
i
better
entertained
than
here
from
santa
cruz
i
crossed
the
mountain
on
a
lonely
and
romantic
trail
to
san
jose
again
finding
very
few
houses
on
the
road
here
i
went
to
work
for
moody
building
a
gristmill
on
the
banks
of
the
coyote
creek
to
be
run
by
water
from
artesian
wells
when
the
mill
was
done
i
went
for
my
horse
and
on
my
return
i
ran
very
unexpectedly
upon
davenport
helms
to
whom
i
had
sold
my
little
black
mule
in
our
talk
was
short
but
he
told
me
he
had
killed
a
man
in
georgetown
and
the
sheriff
was
looking
for
him
he
was
now
venturing
to
town
for
tobacco
and
would
hurry
back
to
the
hills
again
where
he
was
herding
cattle
he
said
he
kept
them
off
at
one
time
by
getting
in
a
piece
of
chaparral
and
presenting
his
gun
to
them
when
they
came
near
they
dare
not
advance
on
him
then
he
laughed
and
said
and
all
the
time
my
gun
was
empty
for
i
did
not
have
a
d
d
thing
to
put
into
it
i
tell
you
they
do
catch
old
davenport
now
do
you
tell
on
me
i
saw
him
no
more
after
that
the
town
of
san
jose
was
now
more
of
a
town
than
it
was
a
few
years
before
the
forty
thieves
and
others
commenced
building
a
city
hall
of
brick
on
the
top
of
old
adobe
walls
and
this
was
the
principal
improvement
except
the
moody
mill
near
the
sutter
house
one
street
north
of
julian
after
finishing
work
on
the
mill
i
drew
my
money
from
the
bank
in
san
francisco
and
started
for
the
mines
on
horseback
near
french
camp
on
the
east
side
of
the
san
joaquin
valley
many
cattle
were
feeding
on
the
plains
and
among
them
much
to
my
surprise
i
found
old
crump
the
ox
that
brought
bennett
and
arcane
children
safe
through
from
death
valley
in
february
he
was
now
fat
and
sleek
and
as
kind
and
gentle
as
when
so
poor
upon
the
terrible
journey
i
got
off
my
horse
and
went
up
to
him
and
patted
my
old
friend
i
was
glad
to
find
him
so
contented
and
happy
and
i
doubt
not
that
he
too
was
glad
i
met
a
man
near
by
and
asked
him
about
the
ox
and
he
said
that
the
owner
would
not
sell
him
nor
allow
him
to
be
worked
for
he
knew
of
the
faithful
part
he
performed
in
the
world
and
respected
him
for
it
at
sacramento
i
deposited
my
money
with
page
bacon
a
branch
of
the
louis
firm
of
the
same
name
considered
the
safest
bank
in
the
united
states
their
bills
were
taken
in
payment
of
government
land
some
rascals
had
some
counterfeit
bills
on
their
bank
and
traded
them
off
for
gold
with
the
missourians
who
were
going
home
and
the
poor
fellows
found
themselves
poor
on
arrival
going
to
my
mine
where
i
left
only
a
cabin
or
two
i
found
quite
a
village
with
two
hotels
and
a
post
office
news
soon
came
that
the
banks
had
closed
their
door
and
page
and
bacon
also
so
i
concluded
that
i
was
broke
the
pikers
said
page
and
bacon
could
not
nor
would
not
fail
but
news
was
against
them
the
boys
now
tried
to
persuade
me
to
go
to
sacramento
and
try
to
get
my
money
and
if
i
succeeded
to
bring
up
a
good
stock
of
goods
and
they
would
buy
of
me
in
preference
to
any
one
else
on
this
showing
i
went
down
and
finding
my
old
friend
lyman
ross
well
known
in
san
jose
who
was
keeping
a
fruit
store
i
told
him
my
business
and
he
took
me
to
booth
carrol
and
i
stated
to
him
the
facts
about
my
money
in
the
bank
and
the
doors
closed
i
told
him
if
he
would
assist
me
i
would
buy
worth
of
his
goods
and
send
them
to
moore
flat
i
endorsed
the
certificate
over
to
him
and
in
half
an
hour
he
came
back
with
the
coin
how
he
got
it
i
never
knew
but
he
did
me
a
great
favor
and
we
have
been
good
friends
ever
since
i
was
no
merchant
nor
had
i
any
mercantile
education
so
i
took
lessons
from
booth
and
allowed
him
to
make
out
for
me
a
bill
of
goods
such
as
he
well
knew
i
needed
with
these
we
loaded
up
two
mule
teams
and
started
for
the
mountain
i
had
about
left
besides
paying
for
the
goods
but
i
felt
a
very
little
troubled
as
to
my
prospect
for
success
for
it
was
a
new
business
to
me
booth
in
a
business
way
was
a
true
father
to
me
and
the
much
needed
points
in
trade
which
he
gave
me
were
stored
away
for
the
use
i
knew
i
would
make
of
them
of
all
those
whom
i
bear
in
grateful
remembrance
none
stand
higher
than
this
worthy
man
i
went
first
direct
to
nevada
city
to
take
out
a
license
that
i
might
best
protect
myself
against
oppositions
and
from
there
i
had
a
walk
of
miles
over
a
rough
mountain
trail
to
my
selected
place
of
business
climbing
the
great
hill
of
the
yuba
river
i
often
tired
and
sat
down
to
rest
and
i
used
this
time
to
study
my
bill
of
goods
and
add
the
freight
and
profit
to
the
cost
so
as
to
be
well
posted
and
able
to
answer
all
questions
readily
when
i
unloaded
the
stock
the
new
trade
seemed
quite
a
task
to
learn
but
i
felt
that
i
was
compelled
to
succeed
and
i
worked
manfully
at
it
when
i
reached
moore
flat
i
found
that
the
boys
had
rented
a
store
for
me
and
their
welcome
was
very
hearty
when
they
found
how
lucky
i
had
been
in
securing
my
money
and
starting
out
as
their
grub
supplier
four
of
us
now
located
some
mining
claims
and
began
a
tunnel
both
to
drain
the
ground
and
to
work
through
the
this
we
named
the
paradise
and
we
expected
that
three
or
four
months
would
elapse
before
we
made
it
pay
but
there
was
in
truth
two
years
of
solid
before
we
got
under
the
ground
but
it
paid
well
in
the
end
the
largest
nugget
of
gold
ever
found
before
this
time
was
a
quartz
boulder
from
the
buckeye
sluice
about
by
inches
in
size
and
when
cleaned
up
at
the
san
francisco
mint
the
value
was
about
two
of
my
partners
in
the
work
hanchett
and
jas
clark
ran
out
of
funds
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
and
i
took
as
much
of
the
expense
as
i
could
upon
my
own
shoulders
about
this
time
learning
by
a
letter
from
her
father
that
bennett
was
lying
at
the
point
of
death
at
bostic
in
san
jose
i
left
hanchett
in
charge
of
my
business
and
in
four
days
i
stood
beside
the
bedside
of
my
friend
endeared
through
the
trials
when
death
by
thirst
starvation
and
the
desert
sands
stared
us
in
the
face
with
all
its
ghastliness
she
reached
out
her
arms
and
drew
me
down
to
her
and
embraced
me
and
said
in
a
faint
whisper
god
bless
you
you
saved
us
all
till
now
and
i
hope
you
will
always
be
happy
and
live
long
she
would
have
said
more
but
her
voice
was
so
weak
she
could
not
be
heard
she
was
very
low
with
consumption
and
easily
exhausted
i
sat
with
her
much
of
the
time
at
her
request
and
though
for
her
sake
i
would
have
kept
back
the
tears
i
could
not
always
do
it
two
doctors
came
one
of
them
spencer
and
as
i
sat
with
my
face
partly
turned
away
i
over
heard
say
to
his
assistant
he
is
a
manly
man
this
presence
and
the
circumstances
brought
back
the
trying
death
valley
struggles
when
this
woman
and
her
companions
and
the
poor
children
so
nearly
starved
they
could
not
stand
alone
were
only
prevented
from
sitting
down
to
die
in
sheer
despair
by
the
encouraging
words
of
rogers
and
myself
who
had
passed
over
the
road
and
used
every
way
to
sustain
their
courage
she
died
the
following
day
with
bennett
i
followed
her
remains
to
oak
hill
cemetery
where
she
was
buried
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
a
board
marked
in
large
letters
sarah
bennett
placed
to
mark
the
mound
the
grave
can
not
now
be
found
and
no
records
being
then
kept
it
is
probably
lost
i
went
home
with
bennett
to
his
home
near
watsonville
and
spent
several
days
meeting
several
of
our
old
death
valley
party
and
dilley
bennett
father
bennett
left
surviving
her
a
young
babe
i
returned
to
moore
flat
and
soon
sold
out
my
store
taking
up
the
business
of
purchasing
gold
dust
direct
from
the
miners
which
i
followed
for
about
two
years
and
in
the
fall
of
sold
out
the
business
to
marks
powers
i
looked
about
through
napa
and
sonoma
counties
and
finally
came
to
san
jose
where
i
purchased
the
farm
i
now
own
near
hillsdale
of
bodley
mccabe
for
which
i
paid
in
the
fall
of
the
same
year
my
old
friend
stockton
of
los
angeles
persuaded
me
to
come
down
and
pay
him
a
visit
his
wife
had
died
and
he
felt
very
lonely
i
had
been
there
but
a
few
days
when
my
old
friend
bennett
and
his
children
also
came
to
stockton
the
children
had
grown
so
much
i
hardly
knew
them
but
i
was
glad
indeed
to
meet
them
i
found
bennett
to
be
a
poor
man
he
had
been
persuaded
to
go
to
utah
being
told
that
a
fortune
awaited
his
coming
there
or
could
be
accumulated
in
a
short
time
he
gave
away
the
little
babe
left
by
his
wife
to
scott
of
scott
valley
in
santa
cruz
and
sold
his
farm
near
the
mouth
of
the
salinas
river
with
what
money
he
had
accumulated
he
loaded
two
mule
teams
with
dry
goods
put
his
four
children
into
his
wagon
and
went
to
cedar
city
utah
he
gave
a
thrilling
account
of
passing
through
mountain
meadows
where
he
saw
here
and
there
little
groups
of
skeletons
of
the
unhappy
victims
of
the
great
massacre
at
that
place
of
men
women
and
children
by
lee
and
his
mormon
followers
and
told
me
the
terrible
story
which
i
here
omit
smarting
under
the
terrible
taxation
of
one
tenth
of
everything
bennett
grew
poorer
and
poorer
and
at
last
resolved
that
he
must
go
away
but
his
wife
could
not
leave
her
own
people
and
so
he
set
off
with
his
children
somewhat
afraid
he
might
be
shot
down
but
he
reached
los
angeles
in
safety
one
daughter
married
a
lawyer
in
san
bernardino
and
died
a
few
years
afterwards
the
other
married
a
capt
johnson
of
wilmington
and
bennett
and
two
sons
went
to
idaho
a
few
years
ago
in
passing
from
san
jose
to
the
coast
my
wife
and
i
spent
sunday
at
scott
valley
scott
invited
us
to
visit
them
in
the
evening
at
the
house
when
all
would
be
at
home
scott
was
the
lady
to
whom
bennett
gave
his
girl
baby
when
he
started
away
for
utah
and
i
felt
very
anxious
to
see
her
now
she
was
grown
up
scott
introduced
us
and
i
sat
and
looked
at
the
little
woman
quite
a
long
time
but
could
not
see
that
she
resembled
either
father
or
mother
my
mind
ran
back
over
the
terrible
road
we
came
and
i
pictured
to
myself
the
woman
as
she
then
appeared
i
studied
over
our
early
trials
crossing
the
plains
over
the
deserts
and
our
trying
scenes
out
of
death
valley
and
turned
all
over
in
my
mind
for
some
time
and
finally
all
came
to
me
like
a
flash
and
i
could
clearly
see
that
the
little
lady
was
a
true
picture
of
her
mother
i
now
began
to
ask
questions
about
her
folks
she
said
her
father
lived
near
belmont
nevada
and
her
died
at
the
monte
los
angeles
county
our
visit
now
became
very
interesting
and
we
kept
a
late
hour
chapter
xvii
since
writing
the
connected
story
which
has
thus
far
appeared
i
turn
back
to
give
some
incidents
of
life
in
the
mines
and
some
description
of
those
pioneer
gold
days
i
have
spoken
of
moore
flat
orleans
flat
and
woolsey
flat
all
similarly
situated
on
different
points
of
the
mountain
on
the
north
side
of
the
ridge
between
the
south
and
middle
yuba
river
and
all
at
about
the
same
altitude
a
very
deep
cañon
lies
between
each
of
them
but
a
good
mountain
road
was
built
around
the
head
of
each
cañon
connecting
the
towns
when
the
snow
got
to
be
three
or
four
feet
deep
the
roads
must
be
broken
out
and
communication
opened
and
the
boys
used
to
turn
out
and
each
one
would
take
his
turn
in
leading
the
army
of
road
breakers
when
the
leader
got
tired
out
some
one
would
take
his
place
for
it
was
terrible
hard
work
to
wade
through
snow
up
to
one
hips
and
the
progress
very
slow
but
the
boys
went
at
it
as
if
they
were
going
to
a
picnic
and
a
sort
of
picnic
it
was
when
they
reached
the
next
town
for
whisky
was
free
and
grub
plenty
to
such
a
party
and
jollity
and
fun
the
uppermost
thoughts
on
one
such
occasion
when
the
crowd
came
through
orleans
flat
to
moore
flat
sid
hunt
the
butcher
was
in
the
lead
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
latter
place
and
both
he
and
his
followers
talked
pretty
loud
and
rough
to
the
flat
fellows
calling
them
lazy
pups
for
not
getting
their
road
clear
hunt
helper
was
a
big
stout
loud
talking
young
man
named
williams
and
he
shouted
to
the
leader
sid
hunt
toot
your
horn
if
you
sell
a
clam
this
seemed
to
put
both
sides
in
good
humor
and
the
orleans
fellows
joined
in
a
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
rested
and
went
home
next
day
both
camps
joined
forces
and
broke
the
road
over
to
woolsey
flat
and
the
third
day
crowded
on
toward
nevada
city
and
when
out
and
across
bloody
run
a
stream
called
thus
because
some
dead
men
had
been
found
at
the
head
of
the
stream
by
the
early
settlers
and
it
was
suspected
the
guilty
murderers
lived
not
far
off
they
turned
down
into
humbug
a
town
now
called
bloomfield
and
as
they
went
down
the
snow
was
not
so
deep
they
soon
met
sam
henry
the
express
man
working
through
with
letters
and
papers
and
all
turned
home
again
a
young
doctor
came
to
moore
flat
and
soon
became
quite
popular
and
after
a
little
while
purchased
a
small
drug
store
at
orleans
flat
in
this
town
there
lived
a
man
and
his
family
and
among
them
a
little
curly
headed
girl
perhaps
one
or
two
years
old
she
was
sick
and
died
and
buried
while
the
ground
was
covered
thick
with
snow
a
little
time
after
it
was
discovered
that
the
grave
had
been
disturbed
and
on
examination
no
body
was
found
in
the
grave
then
it
was
a
searching
party
was
organized
and
threats
of
vengeance
made
against
the
grave
robber
if
he
should
be
caught
no
tracks
were
found
leading
out
of
town
so
they
began
to
look
about
inside
and
there
began
to
be
some
talk
about
this
kittridge
as
the
culprit
he
was
the
very
man
and
he
went
to
his
drug
store
and
told
his
clerk
to
get
a
saddle
horse
and
take
the
dead
child
body
in
a
sack
to
his
cabin
at
moore
flat
and
conceal
it
in
a
back
room
the
clerk
obeyed
and
with
the
little
corpse
before
him
on
the
horse
started
from
the
back
door
and
rode
furiously
to
moore
flat
and
concealed
the
body
as
he
had
been
directed
some
noticed
that
he
had
ridden
unusually
fast
and
having
a
suspicion
that
all
was
not
right
told
their
belief
to
the
orleans
flat
people
who
visited
the
doctor
at
his
store
and
accused
him
of
the
crime
and
talked
about
hanging
him
on
the
spot
without
a
trial
at
this
the
doctor
began
to
be
greatly
frightened
and
begged
piteously
for
them
to
spare
his
life
confessing
to
the
deed
but
pleading
in
extenuation
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
confirming
a
question
in
his
profession
and
wholly
in
the
interest
of
science
that
he
did
it
and
really
to
spare
the
feelings
of
the
parents
that
he
did
it
secretly
he
argued
that
no
real
harm
had
been
done
and
some
of
his
friends
sided
with
him
in
this
view
but
the
controversy
grew
warmer
and
the
house
filled
up
with
people
some
were
bloodthirsty
and
needed
no
urging
to
proceed
to
buy
a
rope
and
use
it
others
argued
and
finally
the
doctor
said
that
the
body
had
not
been
dissected
and
if
they
would
allow
him
and
appoint
a
committee
to
go
with
him
he
would
produce
the
body
and
they
could
decently
bury
it
again
and
there
it
might
remain
forever
this
he
promised
to
do
and
all
agreed
to
it
and
he
kept
his
word
thus
ending
the
matter
satisfactorily
and
the
doctor
was
released
but
the
feeling
never
died
out
the
doctor
friends
deserted
him
and
no
one
seemed
to
like
to
converse
with
him
at
the
saloon
he
would
sit
like
a
perfect
stranger
no
one
noticing
him
and
he
soon
left
for
new
fields
the
first
tunnel
run
at
moore
flat
was
called
the
paradise
and
had
to
be
started
low
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
in
order
to
drain
the
ground
and
had
to
be
blasted
through
the
bed
rock
for
about
feet
four
of
us
secured
ground
enough
by
purchase
so
we
could
afford
to
undertake
this
expensive
job
and
we
worked
on
it
day
and
night
jerry
clark
and
len
redfield
worked
the
day
shifts
and
sam
king
and
wm
quirk
the
night
shift
when
the
tunnel
was
completed
about
feet
the
night
shift
had
driven
forward
the
top
of
the
tunnel
as
a
heading
leaving
the
bottom
which
was
about
a
foot
thick
or
more
to
be
taken
out
by
the
day
shift
they
drilled
a
hole
about
two
feet
horizontally
to
blast
out
this
bench
king
would
sit
and
hold
the
drill
between
his
feet
while
quirk
would
strike
with
a
heavy
sledge
when
the
hole
was
loaded
they
tramped
down
the
charge
very
hard
so
as
to
be
sure
it
would
not
blow
out
but
lift
the
whole
bench
one
day
when
they
were
loading
a
hole
king
told
quirk
to
come
down
pretty
heavy
on
the
tamping
so
as
to
make
all
sure
and
after
a
few
blows
given
as
directed
there
was
an
explosion
and
quirk
was
forced
some
distance
out
of
the
tunnel
his
eyes
nearly
put
out
with
dirt
blown
into
them
and
his
face
and
body
cut
with
flying
pieces
of
rock
he
was
at
first
completely
stunned
but
after
awhile
recovered
so
as
to
crawl
out
and
was
slowly
making
his
way
up
the
hill
on
hands
and
knees
when
he
was
discovered
and
helped
to
his
cabin
where
his
wounds
were
washed
and
dressed
then
a
party
with
lighted
candles
entered
the
tunnel
to
learn
the
fate
of
king
and
they
found
him
lying
on
the
mass
of
rock
the
blast
had
lifted
dead
on
a
piece
of
board
they
bore
the
body
to
his
cabin
there
was
hardly
a
whole
bone
remaining
a
cut
diagonally
across
his
face
made
by
a
sharp
stone
had
nearly
cut
his
head
in
two
he
had
been
thrown
so
violently
against
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
about
feet
high
that
he
was
completely
mashed
he
had
a
wife
in
mass
and
as
i
had
often
heard
him
talk
of
her
and
of
sending
her
money
i
bought
a
check
and
sent
it
in
the
same
letter
which
bore
the
melancholy
news
king
had
a
claim
at
chip
flat
which
he
believed
would
be
very
rich
in
time
so
i
kept
his
interest
up
in
it
till
it
amounted
to
and
then
abandoned
the
claim
and
pocketed
the
loss
we
made
a
pine
box
and
putting
his
body
in
it
laid
it
away
with
respect
i
had
often
heard
him
say
that
if
he
suffered
an
accident
he
wished
to
be
killed
outright
and
not
be
left
a
cripple
and
his
wish
came
true
after
this
accident
the
blacksmith
working
for
the
paradise
was
making
some
repairs
about
the
surface
of
the
air
shaft
and
among
his
tools
was
a
bar
of
steel
an
inch
square
and
or
feet
long
which
was
thrown
across
the
shaft
and
while
working
at
the
whim
wheel
he
slipped
and
struck
this
bar
which
fell
to
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
feet
deep
and
the
blacksmith
followed
when
the
other
workmen
went
down
to
his
assistance
they
found
that
the
bar
of
steel
had
stuck
upright
in
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
and
when
the
man
came
down
it
pierced
his
body
from
hip
to
neck
killing
him
instantly
he
was
a
young
man
and
i
have
forgotten
his
name
those
who
came
to
california
these
later
years
will
not
many
of
them
see
the
old
apparatus
and
appliances
which
were
used
in
saving
the
gold
in
those
primitive
days
among
them
was
the
old
rocker
this
had
a
bottom
about
feet
long
and
inches
wide
with
the
sides
about
inches
high
for
half
the
length
and
then
sloped
off
to
two
inches
at
the
end
there
was
a
bar
about
an
inch
high
across
the
end
to
serve
as
a
riffle
and
on
the
higher
end
of
this
box
is
a
stationary
box
inches
square
with
sides
inches
high
and
having
a
sheet
iron
bottom
perforated
with
half
inch
holes
on
the
bottom
of
the
box
are
fastened
two
rockers
like
those
on
the
baby
cradle
and
the
whole
had
a
piece
of
board
or
other
solid
foundation
to
stand
on
the
whole
being
set
at
an
angle
to
allow
the
gravel
to
work
off
at
the
lower
end
with
the
water
a
cleat
was
fastened
across
the
bottom
to
catch
the
gold
and
this
was
frequently
examined
to
see
how
the
work
was
paying
and
taking
out
such
coarse
pieces
as
could
be
readily
seen
to
work
the
rocker
a
pan
of
dirt
would
be
placed
in
the
square
screen
box
and
then
with
one
hand
the
miner
would
rock
the
cradle
while
he
poured
water
with
the
other
from
a
dipper
to
wash
the
earth
after
he
had
poured
on
enough
water
and
shaken
the
box
sufficiently
to
pass
all
the
small
stuff
through
he
would
stir
over
what
remained
in
the
screen
box
examining
carefully
for
a
nugget
too
large
to
pass
through
the
half
inch
holes
if
the
miner
found
that
the
dirt
did
not
pay
he
took
his
rocker
on
his
back
and
went
on
in
search
of
a
better
claim
another
way
to
work
the
dirt
was
to
get
a
small
head
of
water
running
in
a
ditch
and
then
run
the
water
and
gravel
through
a
series
of
boxes
a
foot
square
and
twelve
feet
long
using
from
one
to
ten
boxes
as
circumstances
seemed
to
indicate
at
the
lower
end
of
these
boxes
was
placed
the
long
tom
which
was
about
two
feet
wide
at
the
lower
end
and
having
sides
six
inches
high
at
the
same
point
the
side
pieces
extend
out
about
feet
longer
than
the
wooden
bottom
and
are
turned
up
to
a
point
some
like
a
sled
runner
and
this
turned
up
part
has
a
bottom
of
sheet
iron
punched
full
of
holes
the
size
of
the
sheet
iron
being
about
feet
by
inches
the
miners
shovel
dirt
into
the
upper
end
of
the
boxes
slowly
and
regulate
the
water
so
that
it
dissolves
the
lumps
and
chunks
very
thoroughly
before
it
reaches
the
long
tom
where
a
man
stands
and
stirs
the
gravel
over
and
if
nothing
yellow
is
seen
throws
the
washed
gravel
away
and
lets
the
rest
go
through
the
screen
immediately
below
this
screen
was
placed
what
was
called
a
riffle
box
by
feet
in
size
with
bars
inches
high
across
the
bottom
and
sides
and
this
box
is
set
at
the
proper
angle
now
when
the
water
comes
through
the
screen
it
falls
perpendicularly
in
this
box
with
force
enough
to
keep
the
contents
continually
in
motion
and
as
the
gold
is
much
heavier
than
any
other
mineral
likely
to
be
found
in
the
dirt
it
settles
to
the
bottom
and
all
the
lighter
stuff
is
carried
away
by
the
water
the
gold
would
be
found
behind
the
bars
in
the
riffle
box
these
methods
of
working
were
very
crude
and
we
gradually
became
aware
that
the
finest
dust
was
not
saved
and
many
improvements
were
brought
into
use
in
my
own
mine
the
tailings
that
we
let
go
down
the
mountain
side
would
lodge
in
large
piles
in
different
places
and
after
lying
a
year
more
gold
could
be
washed
out
of
it
than
was
first
obtained
and
some
of
it
coarser
so
that
it
was
plainly
seen
that
a
better
way
of
working
would
be
more
profitable
there
was
plenty
of
ground
called
poor
ground
that
had
much
gold
in
it
but
could
not
be
profitably
worked
with
the
rocker
and
long
tom
the
bed
rock
was
nearly
level
and
as
the
land
had
a
gradual
rise
the
banks
kept
getting
higher
and
higher
as
they
dug
farther
in
now
it
was
really
good
ground
only
down
close
to
the
bed
rock
but
all
the
dirt
had
some
gold
in
it
and
if
a
way
could
be
invented
to
work
it
fast
enough
such
ground
would
pay
so
the
plan
of
hydraulic
mining
was
experimented
upon
the
water
was
brought
in
a
ditch
or
flume
to
the
top
of
a
high
bank
and
then
terminated
in
a
tight
box
to
this
box
was
attached
a
large
hose
made
by
hand
out
of
canvas
and
a
pipe
and
nozzle
attached
to
the
lower
end
of
the
hose
now
as
the
bank
was
often
feet
or
more
high
the
water
at
this
head
when
directed
through
the
nozzle
against
the
bank
fairly
melted
it
away
into
liquid
mud
imagine
us
located
a
mile
above
the
river
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
we
dug
at
first
sluices
in
the
rock
to
carry
off
the
mud
and
water
and
after
it
had
flowed
in
these
a
little
way
a
sluice
box
was
put
in
to
pass
it
through
these
were
made
on
a
slope
of
one
in
twelve
and
the
bottom
paved
with
blocks
inches
thick
so
laid
as
to
make
a
cavity
or
pocket
at
the
corner
of
the
blocks
after
passing
the
first
sluice
box
the
water
and
gravel
would
be
run
in
a
bed
rock
sluice
again
and
then
into
another
sluice
box
and
so
on
for
a
mile
passing
through
several
sluice
boxes
on
the
way
quicksilver
was
placed
in
the
upper
sluice
boxes
and
when
the
particles
of
gold
were
polished
up
by
tumbling
about
in
the
gravel
they
combined
with
the
quicksilver
making
an
amalgam
the
most
gold
would
be
left
in
the
first
sluice
boxes
but
some
would
go
on
down
to
the
very
last
where
the
water
and
dirt
was
run
off
into
the
river
they
cleaned
up
the
first
sluices
every
week
a
little
farther
down
every
month
while
the
lower
ones
would
only
be
cleaned
up
at
the
end
of
the
season
in
cleaning
up
the
blocks
would
be
taken
out
of
the
boxes
and
every
little
crevice
or
pocket
in
the
whole
length
of
the
sluice
cleaned
out
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
using
little
hooks
and
iron
spoons
made
for
the
purpose
the
amalgam
thus
collected
was
heated
in
a
retort
which
expelled
the
quicksilver
in
vapor
which
was
condensed
and
used
again
when
they
first
tried
hydraulic
work
a
tinsmith
made
a
nozzle
out
of
sheet
iron
but
when
put
in
practice
instead
of
throwing
a
solid
stream
it
scattered
like
an
shotgun
and
up
at
moore
flat
they
called
the
claims
where
they
used
it
the
shotgun
claims
from
that
time
great
improvements
were
made
in
hydraulic
apparatus
until
the
work
done
by
them
was
really
wonderful
in
there
lived
at
orleans
flat
and
moore
flat
in
nevada
county
a
few
young
energetic
and
very
stirring
pioneers
in
the
persons
of
lads
from
to
years
of
age
always
on
the
search
for
a
few
dimes
to
spend
or
add
to
an
already
hoarded
store
and
the
mountain
air
with
the
wild
surroundings
seemed
to
inspire
them
always
with
lively
vigor
and
especially
when
there
was
a
prospect
of
a
piece
not
far
ahead
in
winter
when
the
deep
snow
cut
off
all
communication
with
the
valley
our
busy
tinner
ran
short
of
solder
and
seeing
a
limited
supply
in
the
tin
cans
that
lay
thick
about
he
engaged
the
boys
to
gather
in
a
supply
and
showed
them
how
they
could
be
melted
down
to
secure
the
solder
with
which
they
had
been
fastened
and
thus
provide
for
his
immediate
wants
so
the
boys
ransacked
every
spot
where
they
had
been
thrown
under
the
saloon
and
houses
and
in
old
dump
holes
everywhere
till
they
had
gathered
a
pretty
large
pile
which
they
fired
as
he
had
told
them
and
then
panned
out
the
ashes
to
secure
the
drops
of
metal
which
had
melted
down
and
cooled
in
small
drops
and
bits
below
this
was
and
cast
into
a
mould
made
in
a
pine
block
and
the
solder
made
into
regular
form
about
was
made
up
thus
in
good
and
honest
shape
but
the
boys
soon
developed
a
shrewdness
that
if
more
fully
expanded
might
make
them
millionaires
but
in
the
present
small
way
they
hoped
to
put
to
account
in
getting
a
few
extra
dimes
they
put
a
big
chunk
of
iron
in
the
mould
and
poured
in
the
melted
solder
which
enclosed
it
completely
so
that
when
they
presented
the
bright
silvery
bar
to
the
old
tinker
he
paid
the
price
agreed
upon
and
they
divided
the
money
between
them
and
then
in
a
secure
place
they
laughed
till
their
sides
ached
at
the
good
joke
on
the
tinman
in
due
time
the
man
found
out
the
iron
core
in
his
bar
of
solder
and
thought
the
joke
such
a
good
one
that
he
told
of
it
in
the
saloon
and
had
to
spend
at
least
in
drinks
to
ease
off
the
laugh
they
had
on
him
as
the
victim
of
the
young
california
pioneers
and
these
young
fellows
some
have
paddled
their
own
canoe
successfully
into
quiet
waters
and
are
now
in
the
fullness
of
life
happy
in
their
possessions
while
some
have
been
swamped
on
the
great
rushing
stream
of
business
and
dwell
in
memory
on
the
happy
times
gone
by
the
older
pioneers
in
these
mining
towns
were
in
many
respects
a
peculiar
class
of
men
most
of
them
were
sober
and
industrious
fearless
and
venturesome
jolly
and
happy
when
good
luck
came
to
them
and
in
misfortune
stood
up
with
brave
strong
manly
hearts
without
a
tear
or
murmur
they
let
the
world
roll
merrily
by
were
ever
ready
with
joke
mirth
and
fun
to
make
their
surroundings
cheerful
fortunes
came
and
went
they
made
money
easily
and
spent
it
just
as
freely
and
in
their
generosity
and
kindly
charity
the
old
expression
he
has
a
heart
like
an
ox
fitted
well
the
character
of
most
of
them
when
luck
turned
against
them
they
worked
the
harder
for
the
next
turn
might
fill
their
big
pockets
with
a
fortune
and
then
the
dream
of
capturing
a
wife
and
building
up
a
home
could
be
realized
and
they
would
move
out
into
the
world
on
a
wave
of
happiness
and
plenty
this
kind
of
talk
was
freely
carried
on
around
the
camp
fire
in
the
long
evenings
and
who
knows
how
many
of
these
royal
good
fellows
realized
those
bright
hopes
and
glorious
anticipations
who
knows
the
names
come
back
in
memory
of
some
of
them
and
others
have
been
forgotten

bishop

jim
tyler
who
was
the
loudest
laugher
in
the
town
and
as
he
lived
at
the
clifton
house
he
was
called
the
clifton
house
calf
these
and
many
others
might
be
mentioned
as
typical
good
fellows
of
the
mining
days
the
biggest
kind
of
practical
joke
would
be
settled
amicably
at
the
saloon
after
the
usual
style
one
day
jack
hays
bought
a
pair
of
new
boots
set
them
down
in
the
store
and
went
to
turn
off
the
miners
supply
of
water
when
he
returned
he
found
his
boots
well
filled
with
refuse
crackers
and
water
this
he
discovered
when
he
took
them
up
to
go
to
dinner
and
as
he
poured
out
the
contents
at
the
door
a
half
dozen
boys
across
the
street
raised
a
big
laugh
at
him
and
hooted
at
his
discomfiture
jack
scowled
an
awful
scowl
and
if
he
called
them
pukes
with
a
few
swear
words
added
it
was
a
mild
way
of
pouring
out
his
anger
but
after
dinner
the
boys
surrounded
him
and
fairly
laughed
him
into
a
good
humor
so
that
he
set
up
drinks
for
the
crowd
foot
races
were
a
great
sunday
sport
and
dog
fights
were
not
uncommon
one
dog
in
our
camp
was
champion
of
the
ridge
and
though
other
camps
brought
in
their
pet
canines
to
eat
him
up
he
was
always
the
top
dog
at
the
end
of
the
scrimmage
and
he
had
a
winning
grip
on
the
fore
foot
of
his
antagonist
a
big
husky
who
answered
to
the
name
of
cherokee
bob
came
our
way
and
stopped
awhile
he
announced
himself
a
foot
racer
and
a
contest
was
soon
arranged
with
soda
bill
of
nevada
city
and
each
went
into
a
course
of
training
at
his
own
camp
bob
found
some
way
to
get
the
best
time
that
bill
could
make
and
comparing
it
with
his
own
said
he
could
beat
in
that
race
so
when
it
came
off
our
boys
gathered
up
their
money
and
loaded
down
the
stage
inside
and
out
departing
with
swinging
hats
and
flying
colors
and
screaming
in
wild
delight
at
the
sure
prospect
of
doubling
their
dust
in
a
few
days
they
all
came
back
after
the
style
of
half
drowned
roosters
bob
had
the
race
and
skipped
with
his
money
before
they
could
catch
him
had
he
been
found
he
would
have
been
urgently
hoisted
to
the
first
projecting
limb
but
he
was
never
seen
again
the
boys
were
sad
and
silent
for
a
day
or
two
but
a
look
of
cheerful
resignation
soon
came
upon
their
faces
as
they
handled
pick
and
shovel
and
the
world
rolled
on
as
before
one
fall
we
had
a
county
election
and
among
the
candidates
for
office
was
our
townsman
moore
from
whom
moore
flat
secured
its
name
he
was
the
democratic
nominee
for
county
judge
and
on
the
other
side
was
david
belden
he
whom
santa
clara
county
felt
proud
to
honor
as
its
superior
judge
and
when
death
claimed
him
never
was
man
more
sincerely
mourned
by
every
citizen
the
votes
were
counted
and
belden
was
one
ahead
moore
claimed
another
count
and
this
time
a
mistake
was
discovered
in
the
former
count
but
unfortunately
it
gave
belden
a
larger
majority
than
before
and
his
adversary
was
forced
to
abandon
the
political
fight
in
the
fifties
i
traveled
from
the
north
yuba
river
to
san
bernardino
on
different
roads
and
made
many
acquaintances
and
friends
i
can
truly
say
that
i
found
many
of
these
early
comers
who
were
the
most
noble
men
and
women
of
the
earth
they
were
brave
else
they
had
never
taken
the
journey
through
unknown
deserts
and
through
lands
where
wild
indians
had
their
homes
they
were
just
and
true
to
friends
and
to
real
enemies
terribly
bitter
and
uncompromising
money
was
borrowed
and
loaned
without
a
note
or
written
obligation
and
there
was
no
mention
made
of
statute
laws
as
a
rule
of
action
when
a
real
murderer
or
horsethief
was
caught
no
lawyers
were
needed
nor
employed
but
if
the
community
was
satisfied
as
to
the
guilt
and
identity
of
the
prisoner
the
punishment
was
speedily
meted
out
and
the
nearest
tree
was
soon
ornamented
with
his
swinging
carcass
many
of
these
worthy
men
broke
the
trail
on
the
rough
way
that
led
to
the
pacific
coast
drove
away
all
dangers
and
made
it
safer
for
those
who
dared
not
at
first
risk
life
and
fortune
in
the
journey
but
encouraged
by
the
success
of
the
earliest
pioneers
ventured
later
on
the
eventful
trip
to
the
new
gold
fields
i
can
not
praise
these
noble
men
too
much
they
deserve
all
i
can
say
and
much
more
too
and
if
a
word
i
can
say
shall
teach
our
new
citizens
to
regard
with
reverent
respect
the
early
pioneers
who
laid
the
foundations
of
the
glory
prosperity
and
beauty
of
the
california
of
i
shall
have
done
all
i
hope
to
and
the
historian
of
another
half
century
may
do
them
justice
and
give
to
them
their
full
need
of
praise
as
long
as
i
have
lived
in
california
i
have
never
carried
a
weapon
of
defense
and
never
could
see
much
danger
i
tried
to
follow
the
right
trail
so
as
to
shun
bad
men
and
never
found
much
difficulty
in
doing
so
we
hear
much
of
the
vigilance
committee
of
early
days
it
was
an
actual
necessity
of
former
times
the
gold
fields
not
only
attracted
the
good
and
brave
but
also
the
worst
and
most
lawless
desperadoes
of
the
world
at
large
england
banished
convicts
came
here
from
the
penal
colonies
of
australia
and
van
diemen
land
they
had
wonderful
ideas
of
freedom
in
their
own
land
the
stern
laws
and
numerous
constabulary
had
not
been
able
to
keep
them
from
crime
a
colony
of
criminals
did
not
improve
in
moral
tone
and
when
the
most
reckless
and
daring
of
all
these
were
turned
loose
in
a
country
like
california
where
the
machinery
of
laws
and
officers
to
execute
them
was
not
yet
in
order
these
lawless
sidney
ducks
as
they
were
called
felt
free
to
rob
and
murder
and
human
life
or
blood
was
not
allowed
to
stand
between
them
and
their
desires
others
of
the
same
general
stripe
came
from
mexico
and
chili
and
texas
and
western
missouri
furnished
another
class
almost
as
bad
the
vigilance
committee
of
san
francisco
was
composed
of
the
best
men
in
the
world
they
endured
all
that
was
heaped
upon
them
by
these
lawless
men
and
the
law
of
self
protection
forced
them
to
organize
for
the
swift
apprehension
and
punishment
of
crime
and
the
preservation
of
their
property
and
lives
no
one
was
punished
unjustly
but
there
was
no
delay
and
the
met
his
fate
swiftly
and
surely
justice
was
strict
and
the
circumstances
were
generally
unfavorable
to
thoughts
of
mercy
i
was
in
san
francisco
the
day
after
casey
and
cory
were
hung
by
the
vigilance
committee
things
looked
quite
military
fort
seemed
well
protected
and
no
innocent
man
in
any
danger
i
was
then
a
customer
of
badger
and
lindenberger
clothiers
and
was
present
one
day
in
their
store
when
some
of
the
clerks
came
in
from
general
duty
and
their
comrades
shouldered
the
same
guns
and
took
their
places
on
guard
the
committee
was
so
truly
vigilant
that
these
robbers
and
had
to
hide
for
safety
those
who
came
early
to
this
coast
were
mostly
brave
venturesome
enduring
fellows
who
felt
they
could
outlive
any
hardship
and
overcome
all
difficulties
they
were
of
no
ordinary
type
of
character
or
habits
they
thought
they
saw
success
before
them
and
were
determined
to
win
it
at
almost
any
cost
they
had
pictured
in
their
minds
the
size
of
the
pile
that
would
satisfy
them
and
brought
their
buckskin
bags
with
them
in
various
sizes
to
hold
the
snug
sum
they
hoped
to
win
in
the
wonderful
gold
fields
of
the
then
unknown
california
these
california
pioneers
were
restless
fellows
but
those
who
came
by
the
overland
trail
were
not
without
education
and
refinement
they
were
indeed
many
of
them
the
very
cream
of
americans
the
new
scenes
and
associations
the
escape
from
the
influence
of
home
and
friends
of
wife
and
children
led
some
off
the
dim
track
and
their
restlessness
could
not
well
be
put
down
reasonable
men
could
not
expect
all
persons
under
these
circumstances
to
be
models
of
virtue
then
the
missouri
river
seemed
to
be
the
western
boundary
of
all
civilization
and
as
these
gold
hunters
launched
out
on
the
almost
trackless
prairies
that
lay
westward
of
that
mighty
stream
many
considered
themselves
as
entering
a
country
of
peculiar
freedom
and
it
was
often
said
that
law
and
morality
never
crossed
the
missouri
river
passing
this
great
stream
was
like
the
crossing
of
the
rubicon
in
earlier
history
a
step
that
could
not
be
retraced
a
launching
to
victory
or
death
under
this
state
of
feeling
many
showed
the
cloven
foot
and
tried
to
make
trouble
but
in
any
emergency
good
and
honest
men
seemed
always
in
the
majority
and
those
who
had
thoughts
or
desires
of
evil
were
compelled
to
submit
to
honorable
and
just
conclusions
there
were
some
strange
developments
of
character
among
these
travelers
some
who
had
in
long
attendance
at
school
and
church
listened
all
their
lives
to
teachings
of
morality
and
justice
and
at
home
seemed
to
be
fairly
wedded
to
ideas
of
even
rights
between
man
and
man
seemed
to
experience
a
change
of
character
as
they
neared
the
pacific
coast
amiable
dispositions
became
soured
moral
ideas
sadly
blunted
and
their
whole
seemed
changed
while
others
who
at
home
seemed
to
be
of
rougher
mould
developed
principles
of
justice
and
humanity
affection
almost
unbounded
and
were
true
men
in
every
trial
and
in
all
places
a
majority
of
all
were
thus
and
true
men
from
every
state
from
new
hampshire
to
texas
gathered
on
the
banks
of
the
missouri
to
set
out
together
across
the
plains
these
men
reared
in
different
climates
amid
different
ways
and
customs
taught
by
different
teachers
in
schools
of
religion
and
politics
made
up
a
strange
mass
when
thus
thrown
together
but
the
good
and
true
came
to
the
surface
and
the
turbulent
and
bad
were
always
in
a
hopeless
minority
laws
seemed
to
grow
out
of
the
very
circumstances
and
though
not
in
print
flagrant
violations
would
be
surely
punished
some
left
civilization
with
all
the
luxuries
money
could
buy
fine
trains
of
their
own
and
riding
a
fat
and
prancing
steed
which
they
guided
with
gloved
hands
and
seemed
to
think
that
water
and
grass
and
pleasant
camping
places
would
always
be
found
wherever
they
wished
to
stop
for
rest
and
that
the
great
el
dorado
would
be
a
grand
pleasure
excursion
ending
in
a
pile
of
gold
large
enough
to
fill
their
big
leather
purse
but
the
sleek
fat
horse
grew
poor
the
gloves
with
embroidered
gauntlet
wrists
were
cast
aside
the
trains
grew
small
and
the
luxuries
vanished
and
perhaps
the
plucky
owner
made
the
last
few
hundred
miles
on
foot
with
blistered
soles
and
scanty
pack
almost
alone
many
of
these
gay
trains
never
reached
california
and
many
a
pioneer
who
started
with
high
hopes
died
upon
the
way
some
rudely
buried
some
left
where
they
fell
upon
the
sands
or
rocks
those
who
got
through
found
a
splendid
climate
and
promising
prospects
before
them
of
filling
empty
stomachs
and
empty
pockets
and
were
soon
searching
eagerly
for
yellow
treasure
when
fortunate
they
recovered
rapidly
their
exhausted
bodies
to
health
and
strength
and
gained
new
energy
as
they
saw
prosperity
prospectors
wandered
through
the
mountains
in
search
of
new
and
suitable
gold
diggings
and
when
they
came
to
a
miner
cabin
the
door
was
always
open
and
whether
the
owner
was
present
or
absent
they
could
go
in
and
if
hungry
help
themselves
to
anything
they
found
in
shape
of
food
and
go
away
again
without
fear
of
offense
for
under
such
circumstances
the
unwritten
law
said
that
grub
was
free
by
the
same
unwritten
law
stealing
and
robbery
as
well
as
murder
were
capital
offences
and
lawless
characters
were
put
down
favors
were
freely
granted
and
written
obligations
were
never
asked
or
given
and
business
was
governed
by
the
rules
of
strictest
honor
the
great
majority
of
these
pioneers
were
the
bone
and
sinew
of
the
nation
and
possessed
a
fair
share
of
the
brains
in
a
personal
experience
with
them
extending
from
early
days
to
the
present
time
i
have
found
them
always
just
and
honorable
and
i
regret
that
it
is
not
within
my
ability
to
give
the
praise
they
deserve
when
a
stranger
and
hungry
i
was
never
turned
away
without
food
and
my
entertainment
was
free
and
given
without
thought
of
compensation
or
reward
in
the
chambers
of
my
mind
are
stored
up
the
most
pleasant
recollections
of
these
noble
men
whose
good
deeds
in
days
gone
by
have
earned
for
them
the
right
to
a
crown
of
glory
of
greatest
splendor
these
noble
souls
who
came
here
years
ago
are
fast
passing
away
across
the
mystic
river
and
those
who
trod
on
foot
the
hot
and
dusty
trail
are
giving
way
to
those
who
come
in
swiftly
rolling
palace
cars
and
who
hardly
seem
to
give
a
thought
to
the
difference
between
then
and
now
those
who
came
early
cleared
the
way
and
started
the
great
stream
of
gold
that
has
made
america
one
of
the
richest
nations
of
the
world
i
have
a
suggestion
to
make
to
the
descendants
of
these
noble
pioneers
that
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
their
fathers
and
do
reverence
to
their
good
and
noble
deeds
in
the
early
history
of
this
grand
state
there
should
be
erected
upon
the
highest
mountain
top
a
memorial
building
wherein
may
be
inscribed
the
names
and
histories
of
the
brave
pioneers
so
they
may
never
be
blotted
out
the
jayhawkers
the
most
perfect
organization
of
the
pioneers
who
participated
more
or
less
in
the
scenes
depicted
in
this
volume
is
that
of
the
jayhawkers
and
strange
to
say
this
organization
is
in
the
east
and
has
its
annual
meetings
there
although
the
living
members
are
about
equally
divided
between
the
east
and
the
pacific
coast
as
related
elsewhere
february
is
the
day
of
the
annual
meeting
for
on
that
day
they
reached
the
santa
clara
valley
it
is
greatly
regretted
that
a
more
direct
and
complete
account
of
the
death
valley
experience
of
the
jayhawkers
could
not
have
been
obtained
for
this
work
to
be
sure
it
was
from
the
lips
of
a
living
witness
told
in
many
conversations
but
no
doubt
many
striking
incidents
were
left
out
it
is
however
a
settled
thing
that
these
and
other
individuals
with
whom
he
was
immediately
connected
were
more
intimately
connected
with
the
horrors
of
the
sunken
valley
which
was
given
its
name
by
them
than
were
any
other
persons
who
ever
crossed
that
desert
region
it
will
be
considered
that
this
was
the
most
favorable
time
of
year
possible
and
that
during
the
spring
or
summer
not
one
would
have
lived
to
tell
the
tale
the
author
to
his
best
has
done
his
duty
to
all
and
concludes
with
the
hope
that
this
mite
may
authenticate
one
of
the
saddest
chapters
in
the
history
of
the
golden
state
conclusion
this
story
is
not
meant
to
be
sensational
but
a
plain
unvarnished
tale
of
truth
some
parts
hard
and
very
sad
it
is
a
narrative
of
my
personal
experience
and
being
in
no
sense
a
literary
man
or
making
any
pretense
as
a
writer
i
hope
the
errors
may
be
overlooked
for
it
has
been
to
me
a
difficult
story
to
tell
arousing
as
it
did
sad
recollections
of
the
past
i
have
told
it
in
the
plainest
briefest
way
with
nothing
exaggerated
or
overdone
those
who
traveled
over
the
same
or
similar
routes
are
capable
of
passing
a
just
opinion
of
the
story
looking
back
over
more
than
years
i
was
then
a
great
lover
of
liberty
as
well
as
health
and
happiness
and
i
possessed
a
great
desire
to
see
a
new
country
never
yet
trod
by
civilized
man
so
that
i
easily
caught
the
gold
fever
of
and
naught
but
a
trip
to
that
land
of
fabled
wealth
could
cure
me
geography
has
wonderfully
changed
since
then
where
omaha
now
stands
there
was
not
a
house
in
six
hundred
miles
of
treeless
prairie
without
a
house
brought
us
to
the
adobe
dwellings
at
fort
laramie
and
more
or
less
were
the
long
miles
to
mormondom
still
more
than
miles
from
the
pacific
coast
passing
over
this
wilderness
was
like
going
to
sea
without
a
compass
hence
it
will
be
seen
that
when
we
crossed
a
stream
that
was
said
to
flow
to
the
pacific
ocean
myself
and
comrades
were
ready
to
adopt
floating
down
its
current
as
an
easier
road
than
the
heated
trail
and
for
three
weeks
over
rocks
and
rapids
we
floated
and
tumbled
down
the
deep
cañon
of
green
river
till
we
emerged
into
an
open
plain
and
were
compelled
to
come
on
shore
by
the
indians
there
encamped
we
had
believed
the
indians
to
be
a
and
cruel
people
but
when
we
made
them
understand
where
we
wanted
to
go
they
warned
us
of
the
great
impassable
colorado
cañon
only
two
days
ahead
of
us
and
pointed
out
the
road
to
mormonie
with
their
advice
to
take
it
this
was
chief
walker
a
good
well
meaning
red
man
and
to
him
we
owed
our
lives
out
of
this
trouble
we
were
once
again
on
the
safe
road
from
salt
lake
to
los
angeles
and
again
made
error
in
taking
a
cutoff
route
and
striking
across
a
trackless
country
because
it
seemed
to
promise
a
shorter
distance
and
where
thirteen
of
our
party
lie
unburied
on
the
sands
of
the
terribly
dry
valley
those
who
lived
were
saved
by
the
little
puddles
of
rain
water
that
had
fallen
from
the
small
rain
clouds
that
had
been
forced
over
the
great
sierra
nevada
mountains
in
one
of
the
wettest
winters
ever
known
in
an
ordinary
year
we
should
have
all
died
of
thirst
so
that
we
were
lucky
in
our
misfortune
when
we
came
out
to
the
fertile
coast
near
los
angeles
we
found
good
friends
in
the
native
californians
who
like
good
samaritans
gave
us
food
and
took
us
in
poor
nearly
starved
creatures
that
we
were
without
money
or
property
from
which
they
could
expect
to
be
rewarded
their
deeds
stand
out
whiter
in
our
memories
than
all
the
rest
notwithstanding
their
skins
were
dark
it
seems
to
me
such
people
do
not
live
in
this
age
of
the
world
which
we
are
pleased
to
call
advanced
i
was
much
with
these
old
californians
and
found
them
honest
and
truthful
willing
to
divide
the
last
bit
of
food
with
a
needy
stranger
or
a
friend
their
good
deeds
have
never
been
praised
enough
and
i
feel
it
in
my
heart
to
do
them
ample
justice
while
i
live
the
work
that
was
laid
out
for
me
to
do
to
tell
when
and
where
i
went
is
done
perhaps
in
days
to
come
it
may
be
of
even
more
interest
than
now
and
i
shall
be
glad
i
have
turned
over
the
scenes
in
my
memory
and
recorded
them
and
on
some
rolling
stone
you
may
inscribe
the
name
of
william
lewis
manley
born
near
albans
vermont
april
who
went
to
michigan
while
yet
it
was
a
territory
as
an
early
pioneer
then
onward
to
wisconsin
before
it
became
a
state
and
for
twelve
long
weary
months
traveled
across
the
wild
western
prairies
the
lofty
mountains
and
sunken
deserts
of
death
valley
to
this
land
which
is
now
so
pleasant
and
so
fair
wherein
after
over
years
of
earnest
toil
i
rest
in
the
midst
of
family
and
friends
and
can
truly
say
i
am
content
