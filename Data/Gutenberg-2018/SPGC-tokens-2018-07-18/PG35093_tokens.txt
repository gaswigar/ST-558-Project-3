frosted

if
burke
denby
had
not
been
given
all
the
frosted
cakes
and
toy
shotguns
he
wanted
at
the
age
of
ten
it
might
not
have
been
so
difficult
to
convince
him
at
the
age
of
twenty
that
he
did
not
want
to
marry
helen
barnet
mabel
the
beautiful
and
adored
wife
of
john
denby
had
died
when
burke
was
four
years
old
and
since
that
time
life
for
burke
had
been
victory
unseasoned
with
defeat
a
succession
of
rulers
of
the
nursery
and
a
father
who
could
not
bring
himself
to
be
the
cause
of
the
slightest
shadow
on
the
face
of
one
who
was
the
breathing
image
of
his
lost
wife
had
all
contributed
to
these
victories
nor
had
even
brought
the
usual
wholesome
discipline
and
democratic
leveling
for
a
pocketful
of
money
and
a
naturally
generous
disposition
made
a
combination
not
to
be
lightly
overlooked
by
boys
and
girls
ever
alert
for
fun
and
an
influential
father
and
the
scarcity
of
desirable
positions
made
another
combination
not
to
be
lightly
overlooked
by
impecunious
teachers
anxious
to
hold
their
jobs
it
was
easy
to
ignore
minor
faults
especially
as
the
lad
had
really
a
brilliant
mind
and
when
not
crossed
a
most
amiable
disposition
between
the
boy
and
his
father
all
during
the
years
of
childhood
and
youth
the
relationship
was
very
beautiful
so
beautiful
that
the
entire
town
saw
it
and
expressed
its
approval
in
public
by
nods
and
admiring
adjectives
in
private
by
frequent
admonitions
to
wayward
sons
and
thoughtless
fathers
to
follow
the
pattern
so
gloriously
set
for
them
of
all
this
john
denby
saw
nothing
nor
would
he
have
given
it
a
thought
if
he
had
seen
it
john
denby
gave
little
thought
to
anything
after
his
wife
died
except
to
business
and
his
boy
burke
business
under
his
skillful
management
and
carefully
selected
assistants
soon
almost
ran
itself
there
was
left
then
only
the
boy
burke
from
the
first
they
were
comrades
even
when
comradeship
meant
the
poring
over
a
mother
goose
or
mastering
the
intricacies
of
a
game
of
tiddledywinks
later
together
they
explored
the
world
of
music
literature
science
and
art
spending
the
long
summer
playtimes
still
together
traveling
in
both
and
lands
toward
everything
fine
and
beautiful
and
luxurious
the
boy
turned
as
a
flower
turns
toward
the
light
which
pleased
the
man
greatly
and
as
the
boy
had
but
to
express
a
wish
to
have
it
instantly
find
an
echo
in
his
father
heart
it
is
not
strange
perhaps
that
john
denby
did
not
realize
that
notwithstanding
all
his
training
and
were
unknown
words
to
his
son
one
word
always
however
was
held
before
the
boy
from
the
very
first
mother
yet
it
was
not
as
a
word
either
but
as
a
living
presence
always
he
was
taught
that
she
was
with
them
a
bright
beauteous
gracious
being
loving
tender
perfect
whatever
they
saw
was
seen
through
her
eyes
whatever
they
did
was
done
as
with
her
stories
of
her
beauty
charm
and
goodness
filled
many
an
hour
of
intimate
talk
she
was
the
one
flawless
woman
born
into
the
world
so
said
burke
father
to
his
son
burke
was
nearly
and
half
through
college
when
he
saw
helen
barnet
she
was
sitting
in
the
big
west
window
in
the
library
with
the
afternoon
sun
turning
her
wonderful
hair
to
gold
in
her
arms
she
held
a
sleeping
boy
with
the
marvelous
light
on
her
face
and
the
crimson
velvet
draperies
behind
her
she
looked
not
unlike
a
pictured
madonna
it
was
not
indeed
until
a
very
lifelike
red
swept
to
the
roots
of
the
girl
hair
that
the
young
man
staring
at
her
from
the
doorway
realized
that
she
was
not
in
truth
a
masterpiece
on
an
wall
but
a
very
much
alive
very
much
embarrassed
young
woman
in
his
father
library
with
a
blush
that
rivaled
hers
and
an
incoherent
apology
he
backed
hastily
from
the
room
he
went
then
in
search
of
his
father
he
had
returned
from
college
an
hour
before
to
find
his
father
youngest
sister
eunice
and
her
family
guests
in
the
house
but
this
stranger
this
bewilderingly
beautiful
girl
in
the
upper
hall
he
came
face
to
face
with
his
father
dad
who
in
heaven
name
is
she
he
demanded
without
preamble
that
exquisitely
beautiful
girl
in
the
library
who
is
she
in
the
library
girl
nonsense
you
dreaming
burke
there
no
one
here
but
your
aunt
but
i
just
came
from
there
i
saw
her
she
held
a
child
in
her
arms
ho
john
denby
gave
a
gesture
as
if
tossing
a
trivial
something
aside
you
dreaming
again
burke
the
nursemaid
probably
your
aunt
brought
one
with
her
but
see
here
son
i
was
looking
for
you
come
into
my
room
i
wanted
to
know
and
he
plunged
into
a
subject
far
removed
from
nursemaids
and
their
charges
burke
however
was
not
to
be
so
lightly
diverted
true
he
remained
for
ten
minutes
at
his
father
side
and
he
listened
dutifully
to
what
his
father
said
but
the
day
was
not
an
hour
older
before
he
had
sought
and
found
the
girl
he
had
seen
in
the
library
she
was
not
in
the
library
now
she
was
on
the
wide
veranda
swinging
the
cherubic
boy
in
the
hammock
to
burke
she
looked
even
more
bewitching
than
she
had
before
as
a
pictured
saint
hung
about
with
the
aloofness
of
the
intangible
and
the
unreal
she
had
been
beautiful
and
alluring
enough
but
now
as
a
breathing
moving
creature
treading
his
own
familiar
veranda
and
touching
with
her
white
hands
his
own
common
hammock
she
was
bewilderingly
enthralling
combating
again
an
almost
overwhelming
desire
to
stand
in
awed
worship
he
advanced
hastily
speaking
with
a
diffidence
and
an
incoherence
utterly
foreign
to
his
usual
blithe
boyishness
oh
i
hope
i
did
did
i
i
wake
the
baby
up
with
a
start
the
girl
turned
her
blue
eyes
wide
oh
in
the
library
yes
an
hour
ago
i
do
hope
i
did
wake
him
up
before
the
ardent
admiration
in
the
young
man
eyes
the
girl
fell
oh
no
sir
he
just
woke
himself
oh
i
so
glad
and
and
i
want
you
to
forgive
me
for
for
staring
at
you
so
rudely
you
see
i
was
so
surprised
to
to
see
you
there
like
like
a
picture
and
you
will
forgive
me
er
i
do
know
your
name
barnet
helen
barnet
she
blushed
prettily
then
she
laughed
throwing
him
a
mischievous
glance
oh
yes
i
forgive
you
but
i
do
know
your
name
either
thank
you
i
knew
you
understand
i
denby
burke
denby
denby
son
yes
at
the
admiration
in
her
eyes
and
voice
he
unconsciously
straightened
himself
and
do
you
live
here
breathed
the
girl
to
hide
the
inexplicable
emotion
that
seemed
suddenly
to
be
swelling
within
him
the
young
man
laughed
lightly
of
course
when
i
not
away
his
eyes
challenged
her
and
she
met
the
sally
with
a
gurgle
of
laughter
oh
i
meant
when
you
not
away
she
bridled
he
watched
the
color
sweep
to
her
temples
and
stepped
nearer
but
you
have
told
me
a
thing
of
yourself
yet
he
complained
she
sighed
and
at
the
sigh
an
unreasoning
wrath
against
an
unknown
something
rose
within
him
there
nothing
to
tell
she
murmured
i
just
here
a
nurse
to
master
paul
and
his
brother
denby
wrath
became
reasoning
and
definite
it
was
directed
against
the
world
in
general
and
his
aunt
in
particular
that
they
should
permit
for
one
instant
this
glorious
creature
to
sacrifice
her
charm
and
sweetness
on
the
altar
of
menial
services
to
a
couple
of
unappreciative
infants
oh
i
so
sorry
he
breathed
plainly
aglow
at
the
intimate
nearness
of
this
talk
but
i
glad
you
once
more
before
he
turned
reluctantly
away
he
gazed
straight
into
her
blue
eyes
and
the
game
was
on
it
was
a
pretty
game
the
young
man
was
hard
hit
and
it
was
his
first
wound
from
cupid
dart
heretofore
in
his
curriculum
girls
had
not
been
included
and
the
closeness
of
his
association
with
his
father
had
not
been
conducive
to
incipient
love
affairs
perhaps
for
these
reasons
he
was
all
the
more
ardent
a
wooer
certainly
an
ardent
wooer
he
was
there
was
no
gainsaying
that
though
the
boy
himself
at
first
did
not
recognize
it
as
wooing
at
all
it
began
with
pity
he
was
so
sorry
for
her
doomed
to
slave
all
day
for
those
two
rascally
small
boys
he
could
not
keep
her
out
of
his
mind
as
he
tramped
the
hills
the
next
morning
the
very
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
softness
of
the
air
against
his
cheek
became
a
pain
to
him
was
tied
to
a
stuffy
nursery
his
own
freedom
of
will
and
movement
became
a
source
of
actual
vexation
was
bound
to
a
do
this
and
a
do
that
all
day
he
wondered
then
suddenly
if
he
could
not
in
some
way
help
he
sought
her
as
soon
as
possible
come
i
want
you
to
go
to
walk
with
me
i
want
to
show
you
the
view
from
pike
hill
he
urged
me
to
walk
why
denby
i
ca
again
the
flush
came
and
went
and
again
burke
denby
stepped
nearer
why
not
why
i
could
leave
the
children
besides
it
master
paul
nap
hour
what
a
pity
when
it
so
beautiful
out
then
in
the
morning
she
shook
her
head
i
could
mr
denby
the
afternoon
then
no
is
it
because
you
do
to
to
at
the
look
of
longing
that
leaped
to
her
face
the
thwarted
youth
felt
again
the
fierce
wrath
he
had
known
the
first
day
of
their
meeting
then
by
jove
you
shall
he
vowed
do
they
ever
give
you
any
time
to
yourself
she
dimpled
into
shy
laughter
i
shall
have
a
few
hours
thursday
after
three
good
i
remember
we
go
then
and
they
went
to
burke
denby
it
was
a
wonderful
and
a
experience
never
had
the
sky
been
so
blue
the
air
so
soft
the
woods
so
enchantingly
beautiful
and
he
was
so
glad
that
they
were
thus
for
her
she
was
enjoying
it
so
much
and
he
was
so
glad
that
he
could
give
this
happiness
to
her
enthusiastically
he
pointed
out
here
a
bird
and
there
a
flower
carefully
he
helped
her
over
every
stick
and
stone
determinedly
he
set
himself
to
making
her
forget
her
dreary
daily
tasks
and
when
she
lifted
her
wondering
eyes
to
his
face
or
placed
her
fingers
in
his
extended
hand
how
he
thrilled
and
tingled
through
his
whole
being
he
had
not
supposed
that
unselfish
service
to
a
could
bring
to
one
such
a
warm
sense
of
gratification
at
the
top
of
the
hill
they
sat
down
to
rest
before
them
the
wonderful
panorama
of
grandeur
the
green
valley
the
silvery
river
the
mauve
and
purple
mountains
my
is
this
real
pretty
exclaimed
the
girl
illustration
he
was
looking
at
her
lovely
glorified
face
the
young
man
scarcely
heard
the
words
else
he
would
have
frowned
unconsciously
at
the
real
pretty
he
was
looking
at
her
lovely
glorified
face
i
thought
you
like
it
he
breathed
oh
i
do
i
know
another
just
as
fine
we
go
there
next
a
shadow
like
a
cloud
crossed
her
face
but
i
have
so
little
time
the
cloud
leaped
to
his
face
now
and
became
thunderous
shucks
i
forgot
what
a
nuisance
oh
i
say
you
know
i
do
think
you
ought
to
be
doing
such
work
do
you
forgive
me
but
do
you
really
have
to
yes
i
have
to
she
had
turned
her
face
half
away
but
he
thought
he
could
see
tears
in
her
eyes
are
you
all
alone
then
have
you
any
people
his
voice
had
grown
very
tender
no
no
one
father
died
then
mother
there
was
no
one
else
to
care
and
no
money
oh
i
so
so
sorry
he
spoke
awkwardly
with
obvious
restraint
he
wanted
suddenly
to
take
her
in
his
arms
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
as
one
would
a
child
but
she
was
not
a
child
and
it
would
not
do
of
course
but
she
looked
so
forlorn
so
appealing
so
sweet
so
absolutely
dear
he
got
abruptly
to
his
feet
come
come
this
will
never
do
he
exclaimed
blithely
here
i
am
making
you
talk
of
your
work
and
your
troubles
when
i
took
you
up
here
with
the
express
intention
of
making
you
forget
them
suppose
we
go
through
this
little
path
here
there
a
dandy
spring
of
cold
water
farther
on
and
and
forgive
me
please
i
wo
make
you
talk
any
more
and
he
would
not
indeed
he
vowed
to
himself
she
was
no
child
she
was
a
young
woman
grown
and
a
very
beautiful
one
at
that
he
could
not
console
her
with
a
kiss
and
a
caress
and
a
bonbon
of
course
but
he
could
give
her
a
bit
of
playtime
now
and
then
and
he
would
too
he
would
see
to
it
that
for
the
rest
of
her
stay
under
his
father
roof
she
should
not
want
for
the
companionship
of
some
one
who
who
cared
he
would
be
her
kind
and
thoughtful
good
friend
indeed
he
would
burke
denby
began
the
very
next
morning
to
be
a
friend
to
miss
barnet
accepting
as
irrevocable
the
fact
that
she
could
not
be
separated
from
her
work
he
made
no
plans
that
did
not
include
masters
paul
and
percy
allen
i
going
to
take
your
sons
for
a
drive
this
morning
if
you
mind
he
said
briskly
to
his
aunt
at
the
breakfast
table
mind
of
course
i
do
you
dear
boy
answered
the
pleased
mother
fondly
the
one
that
will
mind
as
you
discover
i
fear
when
you
find
yourself
with
a
couple
of
mischievous
small
boys
on
your
hands
i
not
worrying
laughed
the
youth
i
shall
take
miss
barnet
along
too
oh
helen
that
all
right
then
you
do
nicely
with
her
smiled
allen
as
she
rose
from
the
table
if
you
excuse
me
i
go
and
see
that
the
boys
are
made
ready
for
their
treat
burke
denby
took
the
boys
for
a
drive
almost
every
day
after
that
he
discovered
that
miss
barnet
greatly
enjoyed
driving
there
were
picnics
too
in
the
cool
green
of
the
woods
on
two
or
three
fine
days
miss
barnet
also
liked
picnics
still
pursuant
of
his
plan
to
give
the
forlorn
little
nursemaid
one
good
time
in
her
life
burke
denby
contrived
to
be
with
her
not
a
little
in
between
drives
and
picnics
ostensibly
he
was
putting
up
swings
building
toy
houses
playing
ball
with
masters
paul
and
percy
allen
but
in
reality
he
was
trying
to
put
a
little
interest
into
miss
helen
barnet
daily
task
he
was
so
sorry
for
her
it
was
such
a
shame
that
so
gloriously
beautiful
a
girl
should
be
doomed
to
a
slavery
like
that
he
was
so
glad
that
for
a
time
he
might
bring
some
brightness
into
her
life
and
do
you
see
how
perfectly
devoted
burke
is
to
paul
and
percy
cried
allen
one
day
to
her
brother
i
had
no
idea
the
dear
boy
was
so
fond
of
children
is
he
really
indeed
murmured
john
denby
no
i
had
not
noticed
john
denby
spoke
vaguely
yet
with
a
shade
of
irritation
fond
as
he
was
of
his
sister
and
of
his
small
nephews
he
was
finding
it
difficult
to
accustom
himself
to
the
revolutionary
changes
in
his
daily
routine
that
their
presence
made
necessary
he
was
learning
to
absent
himself
more
and
more
from
the
house
for
a
week
therefore
unchallenged
and
cheerfully
intent
on
his
benevolent
mission
burke
denby
continued
his
drives
and
picnics
and
with
masters
paul
and
percy
allen
then
very
suddenly
four
little
words
from
the
lips
of
helen
barnet
changed
for
him
the
earth
and
the
sky
above
when
i
go
away
she
began
when
you
he
interrupted
yes
why
denby
what
makes
you
look
so
queer
nothing
i
was
thinking
that
is
i
had
forgotten
i
he
rose
to
his
feet
abruptly
and
crossed
the
room
at
the
window
for
a
full
minute
he
stood
motionless
looking
out
at
the
falling
rain
when
he
turned
back
into
the
room
there
was
a
new
expression
on
his
face
with
a
quick
glance
at
the
children
playing
on
the
rug
before
the
fireplace
he
crossed
straight
to
the
plainly
surprised
young
woman
and
dropped
himself
in
a
chair
at
her
side
helen
barnet
will
you
marry
me
he
asked
softly
denby
with
a
boyish
laugh
burke
denby
drew
his
chair
nearer
his
face
was
alight
with
the
confident
happiness
of
one
who
has
never
known
rebuff
you
are
surprised
and
so
was
i
a
minute
ago
you
see
it
came
to
me
all
in
a
flash
what
it
would
be
to
live
without
you
his
voice
grew
tender
helen
you
will
stay
and
be
my
wife
oh
no
no
i
must
i
ca
why
of
course
i
ca
denby
fluttered
the
girl
in
a
panic
of
startled
embarrassment
i
sure
you
you
do
want
me
to
but
i
do
listen
he
threw
another
quick
glance
at
the
absorbed
children
as
he
reached
out
and
took
possession
of
her
hand
it
all
came
to
me
back
there
at
the
window
the
dreariness
the
emptiness
of
everything
without
and
i
saw
then
what
you
been
to
me
every
day
this
past
week
how
i
watched
for
you
and
waited
for
you
and
how
everything
i
did
and
said
and
had
was
just
something
for
you
and
i
knew
then
that
i
i
loved
you
you
see
i
i
never
loved
any
one
before
the
boyish
red
swept
to
his
forehead
as
he
laughed
whimsically
and
so
i
i
did
recognize
the
symptoms
with
the
lightness
of
his
words
he
was
plainly
trying
to
hide
the
shake
in
his
voice
helen
you
will
oh
but
i
i
her
eyes
were
frightened
and
pleading
do
you
at
all
she
turned
her
head
away
if
you
do
then
wo
you
let
me
you
care
he
begged
you
said
you
had
no
one
now
to
care
at
all
and
i
care
so
much
wo
you
let
somewhere
a
door
shut
with
a
low
cry
helen
barnet
pulled
away
her
hand
and
sprang
to
her
feet
she
was
down
on
the
rug
with
the
children
very
flushed
of
face
when
allen
appeared
in
the
library
doorway
oh
here
you
are
allen
frowned
and
spoke
a
bit
impatiently
i
been
hunting
everywhere
for
you
i
supposed
you
were
in
the
nursery
wo
you
put
the
boys
into
fresh
suits
i
have
friends
calling
soon
and
i
want
the
children
brought
to
the
when
i
ring
and
left
till
i
call
you
again
yes
with
a
still
more
painful
flush
on
her
face
helen
barnet
swept
the
blocks
into
her
apron
rose
to
her
feet
and
hurried
the
children
from
the
room
she
did
not
once
glance
at
the
young
man
standing
by
the
window
allen
tossed
her
nephew
a
smile
and
a
shrug
which
might
have
been
translated
into
you
see
what
we
have
to
endure
so
tiresome
as
she
too
disappeared
burke
denby
did
not
smile
he
did
frown
however
he
felt
vaguely
irritated
and
abused
he
wished
his
aunt
would
not
be
so
bossy
and
disagreeable
he
wished
helen
would
not
act
so
cringingly
submissive
as
if
she
but
then
it
would
be
different
right
away
of
course
as
soon
as
he
had
made
known
the
fact
that
she
was
to
be
his
wife
everything
would
be
different
for
that
matter
helen
herself
would
be
different
not
only
would
she
hold
her
head
erect
and
take
her
proper
place
but
she
would
not
well
there
were
various
little
ways
and
expressions
which
she
would
drop
of
course
and
how
beautiful
she
was
how
sweet
how
dear
and
how
she
had
suffered
in
her
loneliness
how
he
would
love
to
make
for
her
a
future
all
gloriously
happy
and
tender
with
his
strong
encircling
arms
it
was
a
pleasant
picture
burke
denby
heart
quite
swelled
within
him
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
upstairs
the
girl
the
cause
of
it
all
hurried
with
palpitating
nervousness
through
the
task
of
clothing
two
active
little
bodies
in
fresh
garments
that
her
thoughts
were
not
with
her
fingers
was
evident
but
not
until
the
summoning
bell
from
the
gave
her
a
few
minutes
respite
from
duty
did
she
have
an
opportunity
really
to
think
even
then
she
could
not
think
lucidly
or
connectedly
always
before
her
eyes
was
burke
denby
face
ardent
pleading
confident
and
he
expected
before
she
saw
him
again
she
must
be
ready
she
knew
with
her
answer
but
how
she
answer
helen
barnet
was
lonely
heartsick
and
frightened
a
combination
that
could
hardly
aid
in
the
making
of
a
wise
unprejudiced
decision
especially
when
one
was
very
much
in
love
and
helen
barnet
knew
that
she
was
that
less
than
two
years
before
helen
barnet
had
been
the
petted
daughter
of
a
village
storekeeper
in
a
small
vermont
town
then
like
the
proverbial
thunderbolt
had
come
death
and
financial
disaster
throwing
her
on
her
own
resources
and
not
until
she
had
attempted
to
utilize
those
resources
for
her
support
had
she
found
how
frail
they
were
though
the
barnets
had
not
been
wealthy
the
village
store
had
been
profitable
and
helen
the
only
child
had
been
almost
as
greatly
overindulged
as
was
burke
denby
himself
being
a
very
pretty
girl
she
had
become
the
village
belle
before
she
donned
long
dresses
having
been
shielded
from
work
and
responsibility
and
always
carefully
guarded
from
everything
unpleasant
she
was
poorly
equipped
for
a
struggle
of
any
sort
even
aside
from
the
fact
that
there
was
apparently
nothing
that
she
could
do
well
enough
to
be
paid
for
doing
it
in
the
past
twenty
months
she
had
obtained
six
positions
and
had
abandoned
five
of
them
two
because
of
incompetency
two
because
of
lack
of
necessary
strength
one
because
her
beauty
was
plainly
making
the
situation
intolerable
for
three
months
now
she
had
been
nurse
to
masters
paul
and
percy
allen
she
liked
allen
and
she
liked
the
children
but
the
care
the
confinement
the
task
of
dancing
attendance
upon
the
whims
and
tempers
of
two
active
little
boys
was
proving
to
be
not
a
little
irksome
to
young
blood
unused
to
the
restraints
of
then
suddenly
there
had
come
the
visit
to
the
denby
homestead
and
the
advent
into
her
life
of
burke
denby
and
now
here
quite
within
her
reach
if
she
could
believe
her
eyes
and
ears
was
this
dazzling
unbelievable
thing
burke
denby
love
helen
barnet
knew
all
about
love
had
she
not
lisped
its
praises
in
odes
to
the
moon
in
her
days
it
had
to
do
with
flowers
and
music
and
angels
on
the
old
porch
back
home
what
was
it
that
boy
used
to
read
to
her
oh
tennyson
that
was
it
and
now
it
had
come
to
love
not
that
it
was
exactly
unexpected
she
had
been
waiting
for
her
lover
since
she
had
put
up
her
hair
of
course
but
to
have
him
come
like
this
and
such
a
lover
so
rich
and
he
was
such
a
grand
handsome
young
man
too
and
she
loved
him
she
loved
him
dearly
if
only
she
dared
say
yes
no
more
poverty
no
more
loneliness
no
more
slaving
at
the
beck
and
call
of
some
hated
employer
oh
if
she
only
dared
for
one
delirious
moment
helen
barnet
almost
thought
she
did
dare
then
bitterly
the
thought
of
his
position
and
hers
rolled
in
upon
her
whatever
else
the
last
two
wretched
years
had
done
for
her
it
had
left
her
no
illusions
she
had
no
doubts
as
to
her
reception
as
burke
denby
wife
at
the
hands
of
burke
denby
friends
and
relatives
and
again
whatever
the
last
two
years
had
done
for
her
they
had
not
robbed
her
of
her
pride
and
the
barnets
away
back
in
the
little
vermont
town
had
been
very
proud
to
helen
barnet
now
therefore
the
picture
of
herself
as
burke
denby
wife
flouted
and
frowned
upon
by
burke
friends
was
intolerable
frightened
and
heartsick
she
determined
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
it
simply
could
not
be
that
was
all
very
likely
anyway
burke
denby
had
not
been
more
than
half
in
earnest
himself
the
bell
rang
then
again
from
the
and
helen
went
down
to
get
the
children
in
the
hall
she
met
burke
denby
but
she
only
shook
her
head
in
answer
to
his
low
helen
when
may
i
see
you
and
hurried
by
without
a
word
her
face
averted
three
times
again
within
the
next
hours
she
pursued
the
same
tactics
only
to
be
brought
up
sharply
at
last
against
a
peremptory
helen
you
shall
let
me
talk
to
you
a
minute
why
do
you
persist
in
hiding
behind
those
two
rascally
infants
all
the
time
when
you
know
that
you
have
only
to
say
the
word
and
you
are
as
free
as
the
air
but
i
must
that
is
i
ca
say
the
word
denby
truly
i
ca
his
face
fell
a
little
what
do
you
mean
you
ca
mean
you
mean
you
wo
marry
me
she
threw
a
hurried
look
about
her
he
had
drawn
her
into
the
curtained
bay
window
of
the
upper
hallway
as
she
was
passing
on
to
the
nursery
yes
i
mean
that
she
panted
trying
to
release
her
arm
from
his
clasp
helen
do
you
mean
you
do
he
demanded
passionately
yes
yes
that
what
i
mean
she
pulled
again
at
her
arm
helen
look
at
me
you
ca
look
me
straight
in
the
eye
and
say
you
do
oh
yes
i
can
i
i
the
telltale
color
flooded
her
face
with
a
choking
little
breath
she
turned
her
head
quite
away
you
do
you
do
and
you
shall
marry
me
breathed
the
youth
his
lips
almost
brushing
the
soft
hair
against
her
ear
no
no
denby
i
ca
i
with
a
supreme
effort
she
wrenched
herself
free
and
fled
down
the
hall
if
helen
barnet
thought
this
settled
the
matter
she
the
nature
of
the
man
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
unlimited
frosted
cakes
and
shotguns
had
not
taught
burke
denby
to
accept
no
for
an
answer
especially
for
an
answer
to
something
he
had
so
set
his
heart
upon
as
he
had
this
winning
of
helen
barnet
for
his
wife
burke
denby
did
not
know
anything
about
love
he
had
never
sung
odes
to
the
moon
or
read
tennyson
to
pretty
girls
on
secluded
verandas
he
had
not
been
looking
for
love
to
meet
him
around
the
bend
of
the
next
street
love
had
come
now
as
an
event
capitalized
love
was
life
and
life
was
heaven
if
it
might
be
passed
with
helen
barnet
at
his
side
without
her
it
would
be
but
burke
ignored
the
alternative
it
was
not
worth
considering
anyway
for
of
course
she
would
be
at
his
side
she
loved
him
he
was
sure
of
that
this
fancied
obstacle
in
the
way
that
loomed
so
large
in
her
eyes
he
did
not
fear
in
the
least
he
really
rather
liked
it
it
added
zest
and
excitement
and
would
make
his
final
triumph
all
the
more
and
satisfying
he
had
only
to
convince
helen
of
course
and
the
mere
convincing
would
not
be
without
its
joy
and
compensation
it
was
with
really
pleasurable
excitement
therefore
that
burke
denby
laid
his
plans
and
carried
them
to
the
triumphant
finish
of
a
carefully
arranged
in
the
library
when
he
knew
that
they
would
have
at
least
half
an
hour
to
themselves
there
i
got
you
now
you
little
wild
thing
he
cried
closing
the
library
door
and
standing
determinedly
with
his
back
to
it
as
she
made
a
frightened
move
to
go
at
finding
herself
alone
with
him
but
denby
i
ca
i
really
must
go
she
palpitated
no
you
ca
go
i
had
altogether
too
much
trouble
getting
you
here
and
getting
those
blessed
youngsters
safely
away
with
their
mamma
for
a
bit
of
a
drive
with
my
dad
then
you
this
i
did
he
was
regarding
her
with
wholly
fond
eyes
and
i
had
you
summoned
to
the
library
but
i
was
careful
not
to
say
who
wanted
you
oh
helen
helen
how
can
you
seek
to
avoid
me
like
this
when
you
know
how
i
love
you
there
was
only
tenderness
now
in
his
voice
and
manner
he
had
taken
both
her
hands
in
his
but
you
must
love
me
not
love
my
wife
i
not
your
wife
you
going
to
be
dear
i
ca
i
told
you
i
could
mr
denby
my
name
is
my
love
his
voice
was
whimsically
light
again
very
plainly
burke
denby
was
not
appreciating
the
seriousness
of
the
occasion
she
flushed
and
bit
her
lip
i
think
it
real
mean
of
you
to
to
make
it
so
hard
for
me
she
half
sobbed
with
sudden
passion
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
hard
then
if
it
hard
it
means
you
love
me
as
if
give
you
up
now
helen
why
do
you
torture
me
like
this
dearest
will
you
marry
me
she
struggled
feebly
in
his
arms
i
told
you
never
why
not
no
answer
helen
why
not
he
loosened
his
clasp
and
held
her
off
at
length
because
because
what
no
answer
again
you
are
promised
to
any
one
else
for
the
first
time
a
shadow
of
uneasy
doubt
crossed
his
face
she
shook
her
head
oh
no
then
what
is
it
her
eyes
frightened
and
pleading
searched
his
face
there
was
a
tense
moment
of
indecision
then
in
a
tragic
burst
it
came
maybe
you
think
i
marry
you
and
be
your
wife
and
have
all
your
folks
look
down
on
me
look
on
you
yes
because
i
not
so
swell
and
grand
as
they
are
i
only
with
a
quick
cry
he
caught
her
to
himself
again
and
laid
a
reproving
finger
on
her
lips
hush
do
you
let
me
hear
you
say
that
again
those
horrid
words
you
are
you
the
dearest
sweetest
little
woman
that
was
ever
made
and
i
love
you
and
i
going
to
marry
you
look
down
on
you
indeed
i
like
to
see
them
try
it
but
they
will
i
only
a
hush
he
almost
shook
her
in
his
wrath
i
tell
you
you
are
and
that
all
i
want
to
know
and
that
all
anybody
will
want
to
know
i
not
in
love
with
your
ancestors
or
with
your
relatives
or
your
friends
i
do
love
you
because
you
are
or
are
not
a
or
a
or
a
butterfly
of
fashion
i
even
love
you
because
your
eyes
are
blue
or
because
your
wonderful
hair
is
like
the
softest
of
spun
gold
it
just
because
you
are
you
sweetheart
and
you
are
the
whole
wide
world
to
me
but
your
father
he
will
love
you
because
i
love
you
dad
is
my
good
chum
he
always
been
that
what
i
love
he
love
you
see
do
you
think
he
really
will
a
dawning
hope
was
coming
into
her
eyes
i
sure
he
will
why
dad
is
the
other
half
of
myself
always
all
the
way
up
dad
has
been
like
that
and
everything
i
wanted
he
always
let
me
have
she
drew
a
tremulous
breath
of
surrender
well
of
course
if
i
thought
you
all
me
you
with
his
impulsive
lips
on
hers
she
had
her
answer
and
there
burke
denby
found
his
chapter
ii
an
only
son
proud
and
blissfully
happy
in
his
victory
burke
went
to
his
father
and
to
his
father
so
far
as
the
latter
himself
was
concerned
he
carried
a
bombshell
for
two
reasons
john
denby
had
failed
to
see
what
was
taking
place
in
his
own
home
first
because
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
that
his
son
could
fall
in
love
with
a
nursemaid
secondly
because
he
had
systematically
absented
himself
from
the
house
during
the
most
of
his
sister
visit
preferring
to
take
his
sister
away
with
him
for
drives
and
walks
rather
than
to
stay
in
the
noisy
confusion
of
toys
and
babies
that
his
home
had
become
because
of
all
this
therefore
he
was
totally
unprepared
for
what
his
son
was
bringing
to
him
he
welcomed
the
young
man
with
affectionate
heartiness
well
my
boy
it
good
to
see
you
where
have
you
been
keeping
yourself
all
these
two
weeks
why
dad
i
been
right
here
in
fact
i
been
very
much
right
here
the
conscious
color
that
crept
to
the
boy
forehead
should
have
been
illuminating
but
it
was
not
yes
yes
very
likely
very
likely
frowned
the
man
but
of
course
with
so
many
around
but
soon
we
be
by
ourselves
again
not
but
what
i
enjoying
your
aunt
visit
of
course
he
added
hastily
but
here
are
two
weeks
of
your
vacation
gone
and
i
scarcely
seen
you
a
minute
yes
and
that
one
thing
i
wanted
to
talk
about
college
plunged
in
the
boy
i
decided
i
do
want
to
finish
my
course
dad
i
rather
go
into
business
right
away
the
man
drew
his
brows
together
but
did
not
look
entirely
displeased
well
he
hesitated
while
i
should
hate
not
to
see
you
graduated
yet
it
not
so
bad
an
idea
after
all
i
be
glad
to
have
you
here
for
good
that
much
earlier
son
but
why
this
sudden
i
thought
you
were
particularly
keen
for
that
degree
again
the
telltale
color
flamed
in
the
boyish
cheeks
i
was
once
but
you
see
then
i
was
thinking
of
getting
married
married
to
john
denby
it
seemed
suddenly
that
a
paralyzing
chill
clutched
his
heart
and
made
it
skip
a
beat
this
possible
future
marriage
of
his
son
breaking
into
their
close
companionship
was
the
dreaded
shadow
that
loomed
ever
ahead
nonsense
boy
time
enough
to
think
of
that
when
you
found
the
girl
but
i
have
found
her
dad
john
denby
paled
perceptibly
you
have
what
he
demanded
you
do
mean
that
you
who
is
she
helen
why
dad
you
seem
surprised
laughed
the
boy
have
you
noticed
suspected
well
no
i
have
retorted
the
man
grimly
why
should
i
i
never
heard
of
the
young
lady
before
what
is
this
some
college
tomfoolery
i
might
have
known
i
suppose
what
would
happen
college
why
dad
she
you
know
her
it
helen
miss
barnet
here
there
no
one
here
but
your
aunt
and
he
stopped
and
half
started
from
his
chair
you
do
you
ca
mean
your
nursemaid
at
the
scornful
emphasis
an
indignant
red
dyed
the
boy
face
i
did
think
that
of
you
dad
he
rebuked
angry
as
he
was
the
man
was
conscious
of
the
hurt
the
words
gave
him
but
he
held
his
ground
and
i
did
not
think
this
of
you
burke
he
rejoined
coldly
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
supposed
my
son
would
show
some
consideration
as
to
the
woman
he
chose
for
his
wife
father
the
boyish
face
set
into
stern
lines
the
boyish
figure
drew
itself
erect
with
a
majesty
that
would
have
been
absurd
had
it
not
been
so
palpably
serious
i
ca
stand
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
even
from
you
miss
barnet
is
everything
that
is
good
and
true
and
lovely
she
is
in
every
way
worthy
more
than
worthy
besides
she
is
the
woman
i
love
the
woman
i
have
asked
to
be
my
wife
please
remember
that
when
you
speak
of
her
john
denby
laughed
lightly
sharp
words
had
very
evidently
been
on
the
end
of
his
tongue
when
with
a
sudden
change
of
countenance
he
relaxed
in
his
chair
and
said
well
done
burke
your
sentiments
do
you
credit
i
sure
but
we
getting
a
little
melodramatic
i
feel
as
if
i
were
on
the
stage
of
a
theater
however
i
stand
corrected
and
we
speak
very
respectfully
of
the
lady
hereafter
i
have
no
doubt
she
is
very
good
and
very
lovely
as
you
say
but
his
mouth
hardened
a
little
i
must
still
insist
that
she
is
no
fit
wife
for
my
son
why
not
obvious
reasons
i
suppose
you
mean
because
she
has
to
work
for
her
living
flashed
the
boy
but
that
excuse
me
seems
to
me
plain
snobbishness
and
i
must
say
again
i
did
think
it
of
you
dad
i
supposed
come
come
this
has
gone
far
enough
interrupted
the
distraught
sorely
tried
father
of
an
idolized
son
you
only
a
boy
you
know
your
own
mind
you
fancy
yourself
in
love
a
dozen
times
yet
before
the
time
comes
for
you
to
marry
i
not
a
boy
i
a
man
grown
you
not
yet
i
shall
be
next
month
and
i
know
my
own
mind
you
see
father
when
i
married
but
you
not
going
to
be
married
at
present
and
you
never
going
to
marry
this
nursemaid
father
i
mean
what
i
say
you
wo
give
your
consent
never
then
i
do
it
without
after
next
month
there
was
a
tense
moment
of
silence
father
and
son
faced
each
other
angry
resentment
in
their
eyes
then
with
a
sharp
ejaculation
john
denby
got
to
his
feet
and
strode
to
the
window
when
he
turned
a
minute
later
and
came
back
the
angry
resentment
was
gone
his
mouth
was
stern
but
his
eyes
were
pleading
he
came
straight
to
his
son
and
put
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
burke
listen
to
me
he
begged
i
doing
this
for
two
reasons
first
to
save
you
from
yourself
you
known
this
girl
scarcely
two
weeks
hardly
an
adequate
preparation
for
a
lifetime
of
living
together
and
just
here
comes
in
the
second
reason
however
good
and
lovely
she
may
be
she
could
possibly
qualify
for
that
long
lifetime
together
burke
simply
because
she
works
for
her
living
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
has
not
the
tastes
or
the
training
that
should
belong
to
your
wife
that
belong
to
your
wife
if
she
is
to
make
you
happy
if
she
is
to
take
the
place
of
your
mother
and
that
is
the
place
your
wife
will
take
of
course
burke
under
the
restraining
hands
on
his
shoulders
the
boy
stirred
restlessly
tastes
training
what
do
i
care
for
that
she
suits
my
tastes
she
would
for
long
you
wait
and
see
too
great
a
risk
to
run
my
boy
i
risk
it
i
going
to
risk
it
again
there
was
a
moment
silence
again
the
stern
lines
deepened
around
the
man
lips
then
very
quietly
there
came
the
words
burke
if
you
marry
this
girl
you
will
choose
between
her
and
me
it
seems
to
me
that
i
ought
not
to
need
to
tell
you
that
you
can
not
bring
her
here
she
shall
never
occupy
your
mother
chair
as
the
mistress
of
this
house
that
settles
it
then
i
take
her
somewhere
else
if
burke
had
not
been
so
blind
with
passion
he
would
have
seen
and
felt
the
anguish
that
leaped
to
his
father
eyes
but
he
did
not
stop
to
see
or
to
feel
he
snapped
out
the
words
jerked
himself
free
and
left
the
room
this
did
not
settle
it
however
there
were
more
words
words
common
to
stern
parents
and
amorous
youths
and
maidens
since
time
immemorial
a
father
appalled
at
the
catastrophe
that
threatened
not
only
his
cherished
companionship
with
his
only
son
but
in
his
opinion
the
revered
sanctity
of
his
wife
memory
wrapped
himself
in
forbidding
dignity
an
impetuous
lover
torn
between
the
old
love
of
years
and
the
new
quite
different
one
of
weeks
alternately
stormed
and
pleaded
a
young
girl
undisciplined
very
much
in
love
and
smarting
with
hurt
pride
and
resentment
blew
hot
and
cold
in
a
manner
that
tended
to
drive
every
one
concerned
to
distraction
as
soon
as
possible
a
shocked
distressed
sister
eunice
packed
her
trunks
and
betook
herself
and
her
offending
household
away
in
time
then
a
compromise
was
effected
burke
should
leave
college
immediately
and
go
into
the
works
with
his
father
serving
a
short
apprenticeship
from
the
bottom
up
as
had
been
planned
for
him
that
he
might
be
the
master
of
the
business
in
deed
as
well
as
in
name
when
he
should
some
day
take
his
father
place
meanwhile
for
one
year
he
was
not
to
see
or
to
communicate
with
helen
barnet
if
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
was
still
convinced
that
his
only
hope
of
happiness
lay
in
marriage
to
this
girl
all
opposition
would
be
withdrawn
and
he
might
marry
when
he
pleased
though
even
then
he
must
not
expect
to
bring
his
bride
to
the
old
home
they
must
set
up
an
establishment
for
themselves
we
should
prefer
that
under
the
circumstances
had
been
the
prompt
and
somewhat
haughty
rejoinder
much
to
the
father
discomfiture
grieved
and
dismayed
as
he
was
at
the
airy
indifference
with
which
his
son
appeared
to
face
a
fatherless
future
john
denby
was
yet
pinning
his
faith
on
that
year
of
waiting
given
twelve
months
with
the
boy
quite
to
himself
free
from
the
hateful
spell
of
this
designing
young
woman
and
there
could
be
no
question
of
the
result
in
john
denby
mind
in
all
confidence
therefore
and
with
every
sense
alert
to
make
this
year
as
perfect
as
a
year
could
be
john
denby
set
himself
to
the
task
before
him
it
was
just
here
however
that
for
john
denby
the
ghosts
walked
ghosts
of
innumerable
toy
pistols
and
frosted
cakes
burke
denby
accustomed
all
his
life
to
having
what
he
wanted
and
having
it
he
wanted
it
moped
the
first
week
sulked
the
second
covertly
rebelled
the
third
and
ran
away
the
last
day
of
the
fourth
leaving
behind
him
the
customary
note
which
in
this
case
read
i
gone
to
helen
i
had
to
i
lived
a
of
misery
in
this
last
month
so
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
waited
my
year
already
we
shall
be
married
at
once
i
wrote
helen
last
week
and
she
consented
now
dad
you
just
have
to
forgive
me
i
i
a
man
now
not
a
boy
and
a
man
has
to
decide
these
things
for
himself
and
helen
a
dear
you
see
when
you
know
her
we
be
back
in
two
weeks
now
do
bristle
up
i
not
going
to
bring
her
home
of
course
at
present
after
the
very
cordial
invitation
you
gave
me
not
to
going
into
one
of
the
reddington
apartments
with
my
allowance
and
my
er
wages
we
can
manage
that
all
right
until
the
stern
parent
relents
and
takes
his
daughter
home
as
he
should
burke
john
denby
read
the
letter
once
twice
then
he
pulled
the
telephone
toward
him
and
gave
a
few
crisp
orders
to
james
brett
his
general
manager
his
voice
was
steady
and
to
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
ominously
emotionless
when
he
had
finished
talking
five
minutes
later
certain
words
had
been
uttered
that
would
materially
change
the
immediate
future
of
a
certain
willful
youth
just
then
setting
out
on
his
honeymoon
there
would
be
for
burke
denby
no
reddington
apartment
there
would
also
be
no
for
there
would
be
no
allowance
after
the
current
month
there
would
be
only
the
wages
and
the
things
the
wages
could
buy
there
was
no
disputing
the
fact
that
john
denby
was
very
angry
but
he
was
also
sorely
distressed
and
grieved
added
to
his
indignation
that
his
son
should
have
so
flouted
him
was
his
anguish
of
heart
that
the
old
days
of
ideal
companionship
were
now
gone
forever
there
was
too
his
very
real
fear
for
the
future
happiness
of
his
boy
bound
in
marriage
to
a
woman
he
believed
would
prove
to
be
a
most
uncongenial
mate
but
overtopping
all
just
now
was
his
wrath
at
the
flippant
assurance
of
his
son
note
and
the
very
evident
confidence
in
a
final
forgiveness
that
the
note
showed
it
was
this
that
caused
the
giving
of
those
stern
momentous
orders
over
the
telephone
john
denby
himself
had
been
somewhat
in
the
habit
of
having
his
own
way
the
harassed
father
did
not
sleep
much
that
night
until
far
into
the
morning
hours
he
sat
before
the
fireless
grate
in
his
library
thinking
he
looked
old
worn
and
wholly
miserable
in
his
hand
and
often
under
his
gaze
was
the
miniature
of
a
beautiful
woman
his
wife
chapter
iii
honeymoon
days
it
was
on
a
cool
cloudy
day
in
early
september
that
and
burke
denby
arrived
at
dalton
from
their
wedding
trip
with
characteristic
inclination
to
avoid
anything
unpleasant
the
young
husband
had
neglected
to
tell
his
wife
that
they
were
not
to
live
in
the
denby
mansion
he
had
argued
with
himself
that
she
would
find
it
out
soon
enough
anyway
and
that
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
spoil
their
wedding
trip
with
disagreeable
topics
of
conversation
burke
always
liked
to
put
off
disagreeable
things
till
the
last
helen
was
aware
it
is
true
that
burke
father
was
much
displeased
at
the
marriage
but
that
this
displeasure
had
gone
so
far
as
to
result
in
banishment
from
the
home
she
did
not
know
she
had
been
planning
indeed
just
how
she
would
win
her
over
just
how
sweet
and
lovely
and
daughterly
she
would
be
as
a
member
of
the
denby
household
and
so
sure
was
she
of
victory
that
already
she
counted
the
battle
half
won
in
the
old
days
of
her
happy
girlhood
helen
barnet
had
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
the
succumbing
of
everything
and
everybody
to
her
charm
and
beauty
and
although
this
feeling
had
perforce
been
in
abeyance
for
some
eighteen
months
it
had
been
very
rapidly
coming
back
to
her
during
the
past
two
weeks
under
the
devoted
homage
of
her
young
husband
and
the
admiring
eyes
of
numberless
strangers
along
their
honeymoon
way
it
was
a
complete
and
disagreeable
surprise
to
her
now
therefore
when
burke
said
to
her
a
trifle
nervously
as
they
were
nearing
dalton
we
have
to
go
to
a
hotel
of
course
helen
for
a
few
days
till
we
get
the
apartment
ready
but
be
for
long
dear
hotel
apartment
why
burke
are
we
going
home
to
home
oh
no
dear
we
going
to
have
a
home
of
our
own
you
know
home
no
i
did
know
helen
lips
showed
a
decided
pout
but
you
like
it
dear
you
just
wait
and
see
the
man
spoke
with
determined
cheeriness
but
i
ca
like
it
better
than
your
old
home
burke
i
what
that
is
and
i
much
rather
go
there
yes
yes
but
young
denby
paused
to
wet
his
dry
lips
er
you
know
dear
dad
was
exactly
er
pleased
with
the
marriage
anyway
and
that
just
it
broke
in
the
bride
eagerly
that
one
reason
i
wanted
to
go
there
to
show
him
you
know
why
burke
i
got
it
all
planned
out
lovely
how
nice
i
was
going
to
be
to
him
get
his
paper
and
slippers
and
kiss
him
and
holy
smoke
kiss
just
in
time
the
fastidious
son
of
a
still
more
fastidious
father
pulled
himself
up
but
to
a
more
discerning
bride
his
face
would
already
have
finished
his
sentence
er
but
well
anyhow
dear
he
stammered
that
very
kind
of
you
of
course
but
you
see
it
useless
even
to
think
of
it
he
he
has
forbidden
us
to
go
there
why
the
mean
old
thing
helen
helen
face
showed
a
frown
as
well
as
a
pout
i
do
care
he
is
mean
if
he
is
your
father
not
to
let
helen
at
the
angry
sharpness
of
the
man
voice
helen
stopped
abruptly
for
a
moment
she
gazed
at
her
husband
with
reproachful
eyes
then
her
chin
began
to
quiver
her
breath
to
come
in
choking
little
gasps
and
the
big
tears
to
roll
down
her
face
why
burke
i
oh
great
scott
helen
dearest
do
begged
the
dismayed
and
distracted
young
husband
promptly
capitulating
at
the
awful
sight
of
tears
of
which
he
was
the
despicable
cause
darling
do
but
you
never
like
that
to
me
choked
the
wife
of
a
fortnight
i
know
i
was
a
brute
so
i
was
but
sweetheart
stop
he
pleaded
desperately
see
we
just
pulling
into
dalton
you
want
them
to
see
you
crying
a
bride
burke
denby
drew
in
her
breath
convulsively
and
lifted
a
hurried
hand
to
brush
the
tears
from
her
eyes
the
next
moment
she
smiled
tremulously
but
adorably
she
looked
very
lovely
as
she
stepped
from
the
car
a
little
later
and
burke
denby
heart
swelled
with
love
and
pride
as
he
watched
her
if
underneath
the
love
and
pride
there
was
a
vague
something
not
so
pleasant
the
man
told
himself
it
was
only
a
natural
regret
at
having
said
anything
to
cast
the
slightest
shadow
on
the
of
this
dear
girl
whom
he
had
asked
to
share
his
life
whatever
this
vague
something
was
anyway
burke
resolutely
put
it
behind
him
and
devoted
himself
all
the
more
ardently
to
the
comfort
of
his
young
wife
in
spite
of
himself
burke
could
not
help
looking
for
his
father
face
at
the
station
never
before
had
he
come
home
when
not
with
his
father
and
not
been
welcomed
by
that
father
eager
smile
and
outstretched
hand
he
missed
them
both
now
otherwise
he
was
relieved
to
see
few
people
he
knew
as
he
stepped
to
the
platform
though
he
fully
realized
from
the
sly
winks
and
covert
glances
that
every
one
knew
who
he
was
and
who
also
was
the
lady
at
his
side
with
only
an
occasional
perfunctory
greeting
and
no
introductions
therefore
the
somewhat
embarrassed
and
irritated
bridegroom
hurried
his
bride
into
a
public
carriage
and
gave
the
order
to
drive
to
the
hancock
hotel
all
the
way
there
he
talked
very
fast
and
very
tenderly
of
the
new
home
that
was
soon
to
be
theirs
be
only
for
a
little
the
hotel
dear
he
plunged
in
at
once
and
you
wo
mind
it
for
a
little
while
we
planning
will
you
darling
i
going
to
rent
one
of
the
reddington
apartments
you
remember
them
on
reddington
avenue
white
stone
with
dandy
little
balconies
between
the
big
bay
windows
they
were
just
being
finished
when
you
were
here
they
you
see
and
we
be
so
happy
there
dearie
just
us
two
us
two
but
burke
there
be
three
there
have
to
be
the
hired
girl
too
you
know
fluttered
the
new
wife
in
quick
panic
surely
you
are
going
to
make
me
do
without
a
hired
girl
oh
no
no
indeed
asserted
the
man
all
the
more
hurriedly
because
he
never
had
thought
of
a
hired
girl
and
because
he
was
rather
fearfully
wondering
how
much
his
father
paid
for
the
maids
anyway
there
would
have
to
be
one
of
course
but
he
wondered
if
his
allowance
would
cover
it
with
all
the
rest
still
he
smoke
a
cigar
or
two
less
a
day
he
supposed
if
it
came
to
a
pinch
and
but
helen
was
speaking
dear
dear
but
you
did
give
me
a
turn
burke
you
see
there
just
have
to
be
a
hired
girl
that
is
if
you
want
anything
to
eat
sir
she
laughed
showing
all
her
dimples
and
burke
loved
her
dimples
i
ca
cook
a
little
bit
i
never
did
at
home
you
know
and
i
should
hate
it
i
sure
it
so
messy
sticky
dough
and
dishes
and
all
that
again
she
laughed
and
showed
all
her
dimples
looking
so
altogether
bewitching
that
burke
almost
but
not
quite
stole
a
kiss
he
decided
too
on
the
spot
that
he
would
rather
never
smoke
another
cigar
than
to
subject
this
adorable
little
thing
at
his
side
to
any
task
that
had
to
do
with
the
hated
messy
dough
and
sticky
dishes
indeed
he
would
something
of
this
must
have
shown
in
his
face
for
the
little
bride
beamed
anew
and
the
remainder
of
the
drive
was
a
blissfully
happy
duet
of
fascinating
plans
regarding
this
new
little
nest
of
a
home
all
this
was
at
four
at
eight
burke
denby
came
into
their
room
at
the
hotel
with
a
white
face
and
tense
lips
well
helen
we
in
for
it
he
flung
out
dropping
himself
into
the
nearest
chair
what
do
you
mean
father
has
cut
off
my
allowance
but
you
you
gone
to
work
there
your
wages
oh
yes
there
are
my
wages
something
in
his
tone
sent
a
swift
suspicion
to
her
eyes
do
you
mean
they
are
so
big
as
your
allowance
i
certainly
do
how
perfectly
horrid
just
as
if
it
was
mean
enough
for
him
not
to
let
us
live
there
without
helen
burke
denby
pulled
himself
up
in
his
chair
see
here
dear
i
sha
let
even
you
say
things
like
that
about
dad
now
for
sake
do
let
us
quarrel
about
it
he
pleaded
impatiently
as
he
saw
the
dreaded
quivering
coming
to
the
pouting
lips
opposite
but
i
i
helen
dearest
do
cry
please
do
crying
wo
help
and
i
tell
you
it
serious
business
this
is
but
are
you
sure
do
you
know
it
true
faltered
the
young
wife
too
thoroughly
frightened
now
to
be
angry
did
you
see
your
father
no
i
saw
brett
who
he
maybe
he
does
know
oh
yes
he
does
returned
burke
with
grim
emphasis
he
knows
everything
they
say
at
the
works
that
he
knows
what
father
going
to
have
for
breakfast
before
the
cook
does
but
who
is
he
he
the
head
manager
of
the
denby
iron
works
and
father
man
he
came
here
to
see
me
by
dad
orders
i
suspect
is
your
father
so
awfully
angry
then
her
eyes
had
grown
a
bit
wistful
i
afraid
he
is
he
says
i
made
my
bed
and
now
i
must
lie
in
it
he
cut
off
my
allowance
entirely
he
raised
my
wages
a
little
and
he
says
it
up
to
me
now
to
make
good
with
my
wages
there
was
a
minute
silence
the
man
eyes
were
gloomily
fixed
on
the
opposite
wall
his
whole
attitude
spelled
disillusion
and
despair
the
woman
eyes
questioning
fearful
were
fixed
on
the
man
plainly
some
new
hidden
force
was
at
work
within
helen
denby
heart
scorn
and
anger
had
left
her
countenance
grief
and
dismay
had
come
in
their
place
burke
has
your
father
objected
so
to
to
me
she
asked
at
last
timidly
abstractedly
as
if
scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
was
saying
the
man
shrugged
oh
the
usual
thing
he
said
you
were
suited
to
me
you
make
me
happy
the
wife
recoiled
visibly
she
gave
a
piteous
little
cry
it
was
too
low
apparently
to
reach
her
husband
ears
at
all
events
he
did
not
turn
for
fully
half
a
minute
she
watched
him
and
in
her
shrinking
eyes
was
mirrored
each
eloquent
detail
of
his
appearance
the
lassitude
the
gloom
the
hopelessness
then
suddenly
to
her
whole
self
there
came
an
electric
change
as
if
throwing
off
bonds
that
held
her
she
flung
out
her
arms
and
sprang
toward
him
burke
it
is
true
it
is
true
she
flamed
i
going
to
make
you
happy
you
just
wait
and
see
and
we
show
him
we
show
him
we
can
do
it
he
told
you
to
make
good
and
you
must
burke
i
wo
have
him
and
everybody
else
saying
i
dragged
you
down
i
wo
wo
i
wo
burke
denby
first
response
was
to
wince
involuntarily
at
the
shrill
crescendo
of
his
wife
voice
his
next
was
to
shrug
his
shoulders
irritably
as
the
meaning
of
her
words
came
to
him
nonsense
helen
do
be
a
goose
he
scowled
i
not
a
goose
i
your
wife
choked
helen
still
swayed
by
the
exaltation
that
had
mastered
her
and
i
going
to
help
you
win
i
say
do
you
hear
me
burke
of
course
i
hear
you
helen
and
so
everybody
else
if
you
look
out
speak
lower
helen
she
was
too
intent
and
absorbed
to
be
hurt
or
vexed
obediently
she
dropped
her
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
yes
yes
i
know
burke
and
i
will
i
will
dear
she
fell
on
her
knees
at
his
side
but
it
seems
as
if
i
must
shout
it
to
the
world
i
want
to
go
out
on
the
street
here
and
scream
it
at
the
top
of
my
voice
till
your
father
in
his
great
big
useless
house
on
the
hill
just
has
to
hear
me
helen
helen
shivered
her
husband
but
she
hurried
on
feverishly
burke
listen
you
going
to
make
good
do
you
hear
we
show
them
we
never
let
them
say
they
beat
us
but
but
we
are
going
to
say
and
hang
back
we
going
to
but
helen
how
what
demanded
the
man
stirred
into
a
show
of
interest
at
last
how
can
we
i
do
know
but
we
going
to
do
it
there
wo
be
hardly
any
money
i
get
along
somehow
and
we
have
to
live
in
a
cheap
little
hole
somewhere
we
ca
have
one
of
the
reddingtons
i
do
want
it
now
and
you
have
to
to
work
yes
i
know
her
chin
was
still
bravely
lifted
there
ca
be
any
maid
now
then
you
have
to
eat
what
i
cook
she
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
hysterical
little
laugh
that
was
half
a
sob
you
darling
i
shall
love
it
he
caught
her
to
himself
in
a
revulsion
of
feeling
that
was
as
ardent
as
it
was
sudden
only
i
so
hate
to
have
you
do
it
sweetheart
it
so
messy
and
doughy
nonsense
you
told
me
it
was
but
i
did
know
then
what
they
were
saying
about
me
burke
they
just
sha
say
i
dragging
you
down
indeed
they
sha
darling
then
you
will
make
good
she
regarded
him
with
tearful
luminous
eyes
of
course
i
will
with
to
help
me
her
face
flamed
into
radiant
joy
yes
me
to
that
it
that
it
i
going
to
you
she
breathed
fervently
flinging
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
to
each
from
the
dear
stronghold
of
the
other
arms
at
the
moment
the
world
looked
indeed
to
be
a
puny
thing
scarcely
worth
the
conquering
chapter
iv
it
is
so
much
easier
to
say
than
to
do
but
nothing
in
the
experience
of
either
burke
denby
or
of
helen
his
wife
had
demonstrated
this
fact
for
them
quite
unprepared
therefore
and
with
confident
courage
they
proceeded
to
pass
from
the
saying
to
the
doing
true
in
the
uncompromising
sunlight
of
the
next
morning
the
world
did
look
a
bit
larger
a
shade
less
easily
conquerable
and
a
distinctly
unpleasant
feeling
of
helplessness
assailed
both
husband
and
wife
yet
with
a
gay
now
we
go
right
away
so
as
to
save
paying
here
from
helen
and
an
adoring
you
darling
but
it
a
burning
shame
from
burke
the
two
sallied
forth
after
the
late
hotel
breakfast
the
matter
of
selecting
the
new
home
was
not
a
difficult
one
at
first
they
decided
at
once
that
if
they
could
not
have
an
apartment
in
the
reddington
chambers
they
would
prefer
a
house
for
burke
said
as
for
being
packed
away
like
sardines
in
one
of
those
abominable
little
cheap
i
wo
so
a
house
they
looked
for
at
the
start
and
very
soon
they
found
what
helen
said
was
a
love
of
a
place
a
pretty
little
cottage
with
a
tiny
lawn
and
a
and
it
so
lucky
it
for
rent
she
exulted
for
it
just
what
we
want
is
it
dearie
but
why
burke
do
you
like
it
think
it
a
dear
of
course
it
is
like
your
father
house
but
we
ca
expect
that
expect
that
great
scott
helen
we
ca
expect
this
cried
the
man
why
burke
what
do
you
mean
it
cost
too
much
dear
in
this
neighborhood
we
ca
afford
it
oh
that
be
all
right
i
economize
somewhere
else
come
it
says
the
key
is
next
door
yes
but
helen
dearest
i
know
we
ca
but
helen
dearest
was
already
halfway
up
the
adjoining
walk
and
burke
with
a
despairing
glance
at
her
radiant
eager
face
followed
her
there
was
indeed
no
other
course
open
to
him
as
he
knew
unless
he
chose
to
make
a
scene
on
the
public
and
burke
denby
did
not
like
scenes
the
house
was
found
to
be
as
attractive
inside
as
it
was
out
and
helen
progress
from
room
to
room
was
a
series
of
delighted
exclamations
she
was
just
turning
to
go
upstairs
when
her
third
desperate
expostulation
brought
her
feet
and
her
tongue
to
a
pause
helen
darling
i
tell
you
we
ca
he
was
exclaiming
it
out
of
the
question
burke
her
lips
began
to
quiver
and
when
you
know
how
much
i
want
it
sweetheart
do
please
make
it
any
harder
for
me
he
begged
give
you
a
dozen
houses
like
this
if
i
could
and
you
know
it
but
we
ca
afford
even
this
one
the
rent
is
forty
dollars
i
heard
her
tell
you
when
she
gave
you
the
key
never
mind
we
can
economize
other
ways
but
helen
i
only
get
sixty
all
told
we
ca
pay
forty
for
rent
oh
but
burke
that
leaves
twenty
and
we
can
do
a
lot
on
twenty
just
as
if
what
we
ate
would
cost
us
that
i
do
care
for
meat
anyhow
much
we
cut
that
out
and
i
hate
grapefruit
and
olives
they
cost
a
lot
allen
was
always
having
them
and
the
distraught
husband
interrupted
with
an
impatient
gesture
grapefruit
and
olives
indeed
and
as
if
food
were
all
of
it
where
are
our
clothes
and
coal
and
and
doctor
bills
and
i
coming
from
why
great
scott
helen
i
smoke
half
that
in
a
week
sometimes
not
that
i
shall
now
of
course
he
added
hastily
but
honestly
dearie
we
simply
ca
do
it
now
come
be
a
good
girl
and
let
go
on
we
simply
wasting
time
here
helen
convinced
at
last
tossed
him
the
key
with
a
teary
all
right
take
it
back
then
i
sha
i
know
i
should
right
before
her
the
next
minute
at
sight
of
the
abject
woe
and
dismay
on
her
husband
face
she
flung
herself
upon
him
with
a
burst
of
sobs
there
there
burke
here
i
am
so
soon
making
a
fuss
because
we
afford
things
but
i
wo
any
more
truly
i
wo
i
was
a
mean
horrid
old
thing
yes
i
was
she
reiterated
in
answer
to
his
indignant
denial
come
let
go
quick
she
exclaimed
pulling
herself
away
and
lifting
her
head
superbly
i
do
want
the
old
place
anyhow
truly
i
do
and
with
a
dazzling
smile
she
reached
out
her
hand
and
tripped
enticingly
ahead
of
him
toward
the
door
while
the
man
bewildered
but
enthralled
by
this
extraordinary
leap
from
fretful
stubbornness
to
gay
docility
hurried
after
her
with
an
incoherent
jumble
of
rapturous
adjectives
such
was
and
burke
denby
first
experience
of
the
second
though
different
in
detail
was
similar
in
disappointment
so
also
were
the
third
and
the
fourth
experiences
not
indeed
until
the
weary
distracted
pair
had
spent
three
days
in
time
all
their
patience
and
most
of
their
good
nature
did
they
finally
arrive
at
a
decision
and
then
their
selection
alas
proved
to
be
one
of
the
despised
tiny
flats
in
which
according
to
the
unhappy
young
bridegroom
they
were
destined
to
be
packed
like
sardines
after
all
it
had
been
the
elegant
mirror
in
the
parlor
and
the
just
grand
tiled
and
tessellated
entrance
that
had
been
the
determining
factors
in
the
decision
for
burke
thankful
that
at
last
something
within
reach
of
his
pocketbook
had
been
found
to
bring
a
sparkle
to
his
beloved
eyes
had
stifled
his
own
horror
at
the
tawdry
cheapness
of
it
all
and
had
given
a
consent
that
was
not
without
a
measure
of
relief
born
of
the
three
long
days
of
weary
hopeless
search
dalton
like
most
manufacturing
towns
of
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
souls
had
all
the
diversity
of
a
much
larger
place
there
was
west
hill
where
were
the
pillared
and
porticoed
residences
of
the
pretentious
and
the
pretending
set
in
painfully
new
lawns
and
there
was
valley
street
a
double
line
of
ramshackle
wooden
buildings
with
broken
steps
and
shutterless
windows
where
a
blade
of
grass
was
a
stranger
and
a
flower
unknown
save
for
perhaps
a
sickly
geranium
on
a
tenement
window
sill
there
was
old
dalton
with
its
winding
streets
clambering
all
over
the
slope
of
elm
hill
where
old
colonial
mansions
with
an
air
of
aloofness
borrowed
quite
possibly
from
their
occupants
seemed
ever
to
be
withdrawing
farther
and
farther
away
from
plebeian
noise
and
publicity
there
was
of
course
the
mill
district
where
were
the
chimneys
and
great
black
buildings
that
meant
the
town
bread
and
butter
and
there
were
the
adjoining
streets
of
workmen
houses
fitted
to
give
a
sensitive
soul
the
horrors
so
seemingly
endless
was
the
repetition
of
covered
stoop
and
dormer
window
always
exactly
the
same
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
there
was
too
the
bustling
asphalted
business
center
and
there
were
numerous
streets
of
simple
pretty
cottages
and
substantial
residences
among
which
with
growing
frequency
there
were
beginning
to
appear
the
tall
apartment
houses
ranging
all
the
way
from
the
exclusive
expensive
reddington
chambers
down
to
the
flimsy
structures
like
the
one
whose
tawdry
ornamentation
had
caught
the
fancy
of
burke
wife
to
burke
denby
himself
late
of
denby
house
perhaps
the
most
aloof
of
all
the
old
colonials
the
place
was
a
nightmare
of
horror
but
because
his
wife
eyes
had
glistened
and
because
his
wife
lips
had
caroled
a
joyous
oh
burke
i
this
place
darling
and
because
most
important
of
all
if
it
must
be
confessed
the
rent
was
only
twenty
dollars
a
month
he
had
uttered
a
grim
all
right
take
it
and
the
selection
of
the
home
was
accomplished
not
until
they
were
on
the
way
to
the
hotel
that
night
did
there
come
to
the
young
husband
the
full
realizing
sense
that
housekeeping
meant
furniture
oh
of
course
i
it
did
he
groaned
after
his
first
despairing
ejaculation
but
i
just
did
think
that
all
our
furniture
at
home
we
always
had
but
of
course
it
does
have
to
be
bought
at
first
of
course
and
did
think
either
laughed
helen
you
see
always
had
furniture
too
i
guess
but
then
it
be
grand
to
buy
it
i
love
new
things
burke
denby
frowned
buy
it
that
all
right
if
we
had
the
money
to
pay
heaven
only
knows
how
much
it
cost
i
do
but
burke
you
got
money
have
you
you
took
a
big
roll
out
of
your
pocket
last
night
he
gave
her
a
scornful
glance
big
roll
indeed
how
far
do
you
suppose
that
would
go
toward
furnishing
a
home
of
course
i
got
some
money
a
little
left
from
my
allowance
but
that
does
mean
i
got
enough
to
furnish
a
home
then
let
give
up
housekeeping
and
board
proposed
helen
then
we
wo
have
to
buy
any
furniture
and
i
think
i
like
it
better
anyhow
and
i
you
would
after
you
sampled
my
cooking
she
finished
laughingly
but
her
husband
did
not
smile
the
frown
only
deepened
as
he
ejaculated
board
not
much
helen
we
board
at
a
decent
place
cost
too
much
and
as
for
the
cheap
variety
great
scott
helen
i
wonder
if
you
think
i
stand
for
that
heaven
knows
we
be
enough
gossiped
about
as
it
is
without
our
planting
ourselves
right
under
the
noses
of
half
the
in
town
for
them
to
and
and
every
time
we
turn
around
or
do
turn
around
no
helen
shut
ourselves
up
somewhere
within
four
walls
we
can
call
home
even
if
we
have
to
furnish
it
with
only
two
chairs
and
a
bed
and
a
kitchen
stove
it
be
ours
and
we
be
where
we
wo
be
stared
at
helen
laughed
lightly
dear
dear
burke
how
you
do
run
on
just
as
if
one
minded
a
little
staring
i
rather
like
it
myself
if
i
know
my
clothes
and
my
back
hair
are
all
right
ugh
helen
well
i
do
she
laughed
uptilting
her
chin
it
makes
one
feel
so
sort
of
er
important
but
i
wo
say
again
unless
you
begin
to
scold
at
my
cooking
she
finished
with
an
arch
glance
as
if
i
could
do
that
cried
the
man
promptly
again
the
adoring
husband
i
shall
love
everything
you
do
just
because
it
that
do
it
the
only
trouble
will
be
wo
get
enough
to
eat
because
i
shall
want
to
eat
it
all
you
darling
are
you
the
best
ever
she
cooed
giving
his
arm
a
surreptitious
squeeze
but
really
you
know
i
am
going
to
be
a
cook
i
got
a
cookbook
so
soon
where
did
you
get
that
yesterday
while
you
went
into
stoddard
for
that
i
saw
one
in
the
window
next
door
and
i
went
in
and
bought
it
was
two
dollars
so
it
ought
to
be
a
good
one
and
that
makes
me
think
it
took
all
the
money
i
had
in
my
purse
so
i
i
afraid
i
have
to
have
some
more
dear
why
of
course
of
course
you
must
go
without
money
a
minute
and
the
young
husband
with
all
the
alacrity
of
a
naturally
generous
nature
supplemented
by
the
embarrassment
of
this
new
experience
of
being
asked
for
money
by
the
girl
he
loved
plunged
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
crowded
two
bills
into
her
unresisting
fingers
there
and
i
wo
be
so
careless
again
dear
i
do
ever
mean
you
to
have
to
for
money
sweetheart
oh
thank
you
she
murmured
tucking
the
bills
into
her
little
handbag
i
sha
need
any
more
for
ever
so
long
i
sure
i
going
to
be
economical
you
know
of
course
you
are
you
going
to
be
a
little
brick
know
and
we
wo
mind
anything
if
we
only
together
she
breathed
there
wo
be
anything
to
mind
he
answered
fervently
with
an
ardent
glance
that
would
have
been
a
kiss
had
it
not
been
for
the
annoying
presence
of
a
few
score
of
dalton
other
inhabitants
on
the
street
together
with
themselves
the
next
minute
they
reached
the
hotel
at
nine
the
following
morning
and
burke
denby
sallied
forth
to
buy
the
furniture
for
their
tenement
as
helen
called
it
until
her
husband
annoyed
remonstrances
changed
the
word
to
apartment
burke
denby
learned
many
things
during
the
next
few
hours
he
learned
first
that
tables
and
chairs
and
beds
and
stoves
really
decent
ones
that
a
fellow
could
endure
the
sight
of
cost
a
prodigious
amount
of
money
but
to
offset
this
and
to
make
life
really
worth
the
living
after
all
it
seemed
that
one
might
buy
a
quantity
sufficient
for
needs
and
pay
for
them
in
installments
week
by
week
this
idea
while
not
wholly
satisfactory
seemed
the
only
way
of
stretching
their
limited
means
to
cover
their
many
needs
and
after
some
hesitation
it
was
adopted
there
remained
then
only
the
matter
of
selection
and
it
was
just
here
that
burke
denby
learned
something
else
he
learned
that
two
people
otherwise
apparently
in
perfect
accord
could
disagree
most
violently
over
the
shape
of
a
chair
or
the
shade
of
a
rug
indeed
he
would
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
such
elements
of
soul
torture
could
lie
in
a
mere
matter
of
color
or
texture
and
how
any
one
with
eyes
and
sensibilities
could
wish
to
select
for
one
daily
companions
such
a
mass
of
gingerbread
decoration
and
glaring
colors
as
seemed
to
meet
the
fancy
of
his
wife
he
could
not
understand
neither
could
he
understand
why
all
his
selections
and
preferences
were
promptly
dubbed
dingy
and
homely
nor
why
nothing
that
he
liked
pleased
her
at
all
as
such
was
certainly
the
case
however
he
came
to
express
these
preferences
less
and
less
frequently
and
in
the
end
he
always
bought
what
she
wanted
particularly
as
the
price
on
her
choice
was
nearly
always
lower
than
the
one
on
his
which
was
an
argument
in
its
favor
that
he
found
it
hard
to
refute
tractable
as
he
was
as
to
quality
however
he
did
have
to
draw
a
sharp
line
as
to
quantity
for
helen
with
the
cheerful
slogan
why
only
cents
a
week
more
burke
seemed
not
to
realize
that
there
was
a
limit
even
to
the
number
of
those
one
might
spend
on
sixty
dollars
a
month
true
at
the
beginning
she
did
remind
him
that
they
could
eat
less
till
they
got
the
things
paid
for
and
that
her
clothes
were
all
new
anyhow
being
a
bride
so
but
she
had
not
said
that
again
perhaps
because
she
saw
the
salesman
turn
his
back
to
laugh
and
perhaps
because
she
was
a
little
frightened
at
the
look
on
her
husband
face
at
all
events
when
burke
did
at
last
insist
that
they
had
bought
quite
enough
she
acquiesced
with
some
measure
of
grace
burke
himself
when
the
shopping
was
finished
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
yet
with
an
inward
shudder
at
the
recollection
of
certain
things
marked
sold
to
burke
denby
oh
well
he
comforted
himself
helen
happy
and
that
the
main
thing
and
i
sha
see
them
much
i
away
days
and
asleep
nights
nor
did
it
occur
to
him
that
this
was
not
the
usual
attitude
of
a
supposedly
proud
bridegroom
toward
his
new
little
nest
of
a
home
getting
settled
in
the
little
dale
street
apartment
was
so
far
as
burke
was
concerned
a
mere
matter
of
moving
from
the
hotel
and
dumping
the
contents
of
his
trunk
into
his
new
chiffonier
and
closet
true
helen
looking
tired
and
flurried
and
not
nearly
so
pretty
as
usual
brought
to
him
some
borrowed
tools
together
with
innumerable
curtains
and
rods
and
nails
and
hooks
that
simply
must
be
put
up
she
said
before
she
could
do
a
thing
but
burke
after
a
trial
during
which
he
mashed
his
thumb
and
bored
three
holes
in
wrong
places
flew
into
a
passion
of
irritability
and
bade
her
get
the
janitor
who
owned
the
darn
things
to
do
the
job
and
to
pay
him
what
he
asked
be
worth
it
no
matter
what
it
was
with
a
very
hasty
kiss
then
burke
banged
out
of
the
house
and
headed
for
the
denby
iron
works
it
was
not
alone
the
curtains
or
the
offending
hammer
that
was
wrong
with
burke
denby
that
morning
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
not
only
meet
his
fellow
employees
and
take
his
place
among
them
but
he
must
face
his
father
and
he
was
dreading
yet
longing
to
see
his
father
he
had
not
seen
him
since
he
bade
him
and
went
upstairs
to
his
own
room
the
month
before
to
write
that
farewell
note
once
since
coming
back
from
his
wedding
trip
he
had
been
tempted
to
leave
town
and
never
see
his
father
again
until
he
should
have
made
for
himself
the
name
and
the
money
that
he
was
going
to
make
then
he
would
come
back
and
cry
behold
this
is
i
your
son
and
this
is
helen
my
wife
who
you
see
has
dragged
me
down
he
would
not
of
course
like
that
but
he
would
show
them
he
would
this
had
been
when
he
first
learned
from
brett
of
the
and
of
his
father
implacable
anger
then
had
come
the
better
braver
decision
he
would
stay
where
he
was
he
would
make
the
name
and
the
money
right
here
under
his
father
very
eyes
it
would
be
harder
of
course
but
there
would
then
be
all
the
more
glory
in
the
winning
besides
to
leave
now
would
look
like
defeat
would
make
one
seem
almost
like
a
quitter
and
his
father
hated
quitters
he
would
like
to
show
his
father
he
show
his
father
and
he
would
show
him
right
here
and
had
not
helen
his
dear
wife
said
that
she
would
aid
him
as
if
he
could
help
winning
out
under
those
circumstances
it
was
with
thoughts
such
as
these
that
he
went
now
to
meet
his
father
especially
was
he
thinking
of
helen
dear
helen
poor
helen
struggling
back
there
with
those
abominable
hooks
and
curtains
and
he
had
been
such
a
brute
to
snap
her
up
so
crossly
he
would
not
do
it
again
it
was
only
that
he
was
so
dreading
this
first
meeting
with
his
father
after
that
it
would
be
easier
there
would
not
be
anything
then
only
just
to
keep
steadily
going
till
he
made
good
he
and
helen
but
now
father
would
be
proud
to
see
how
finely
he
was
taking
it
with
chin
up
and
shoulders
back
therefore
burke
denby
walked
into
his
father
office
well
father
he
began
with
cheery
briskness
then
instantly
voice
and
manner
changed
as
he
took
a
hurried
step
forward
dad
what
is
it
are
you
ill
so
absorbed
had
burke
denby
been
over
the
part
he
himself
was
playing
in
this
little
drama
of
denby
and
son
that
he
had
given
no
thought
as
to
the
probable
looks
or
actions
of
any
other
member
of
the
cast
he
was
quite
unprepared
therefore
for
the
change
in
the
man
he
now
saw
before
him
the
pallor
the
shrunken
cheeks
the
stooped
shoulders
the
unmistakable
something
that
made
the
usually
erect
debonair
man
look
suddenly
worn
and
old
dad
you
are
ill
exclaimed
burke
in
dismay
john
denby
got
to
his
feet
at
once
he
even
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
yet
burke
who
took
the
hand
felt
suddenly
that
there
were
uncounted
miles
of
space
between
them
ah
burke
how
are
you
no
i
not
ill
at
all
and
you
are
you
well
er
ah
oh
yes
very
well
er
very
well
that
good
i
glad
there
was
a
brief
pause
a
torrent
of
words
swept
to
the
tip
of
the
younger
man
tongue
but
nothing
found
voice
except
another
faltering
er
yes
very
well
which
burke
had
not
meant
to
say
at
all
there
was
a
second
brief
pause
then
john
denby
sat
down
you
will
find
brett
in
his
office
you
have
come
to
work
i
dare
say
he
observed
as
he
turned
to
the
letters
on
his
desk
er
yes
stammered
the
young
man
the
next
moment
he
found
himself
alone
white
and
shaken
the
other
side
of
his
father
door
to
work
oh
yes
he
had
come
to
work
but
he
had
come
first
to
talk
there
were
a
whole
lot
of
things
he
had
meant
to
say
to
his
father
first
of
course
there
would
have
had
to
be
something
in
the
nature
of
an
apology
or
the
like
to
patch
up
the
quarrel
then
he
would
tell
him
how
he
was
really
going
to
make
good
he
and
helen
after
that
they
could
get
down
to
one
of
their
chats
they
always
had
been
chums
he
and
dad
and
they
had
had
a
talk
for
four
weeks
why
for
three
weeks
he
had
been
saving
up
a
story
a
dandy
story
that
dad
would
appreciate
and
there
were
other
things
serious
things
that
and
here
already
he
had
seen
his
father
and
it
was
over
and
he
had
not
said
a
word
nothing
of
what
he
had
meant
to
say
he
believed
he
would
go
back
with
an
angry
gesture
burke
denby
turned
and
extended
his
hand
halfway
toward
the
closed
door
then
with
an
impatient
shrug
he
whirled
about
and
strode
toward
the
door
marked
j
brett
general
manager
if
young
denby
had
obeyed
his
first
impulse
and
reëntered
his
office
he
would
have
found
the
man
with
his
head
bowed
on
the
desk
his
arms
outflung
john
denby
too
was
white
and
shaken
he
too
had
been
dreading
this
meeting
and
longing
for
it
that
it
might
be
over
there
was
now
however
on
his
part
no
feeling
of
chagrin
and
impotence
because
of
things
that
had
not
been
said
there
was
only
a
shuddering
relief
that
things
had
been
said
that
he
had
been
able
to
carry
it
straight
through
as
he
had
planned
that
he
had
not
shown
his
boy
how
much
he
cared
he
was
glad
that
his
pride
had
been
equal
to
the
strain
that
he
had
not
weakly
succumbed
at
the
first
glimpse
of
his
son
face
the
first
touch
of
his
son
hand
as
he
had
so
feared
that
he
would
do
and
he
had
not
succumbed
though
he
had
almost
gone
down
before
the
quick
terror
and
affectionate
dismay
that
had
leaped
into
his
voice
and
eyes
at
sight
of
his
own
changed
appearance
why
not
he
keep
those
abominable
portions
of
his
anatomy
from
being
so
wretchedly
telltale
but
he
had
remembered
in
time
did
the
boy
think
then
that
a
mere
word
of
sympathy
now
could
balance
the
scale
against
so
base
a
disregard
of
everything
loyal
and
filial
a
month
ago
then
he
would
show
that
it
could
not
and
he
had
shown
it
what
if
he
did
know
now
even
better
than
he
had
known
it
all
these
last
miserable
four
weeks
that
his
whole
world
had
lain
in
his
boy
hand
that
his
whole
life
had
been
bounded
by
his
boy
smile
his
whole
soul
immersed
in
his
boy
future
what
if
he
did
know
that
all
the
power
and
wealth
and
fame
of
name
that
he
had
won
were
as
the
dust
in
his
fingers
if
he
might
not
pass
them
on
to
his
son
he
was
not
going
to
let
burke
know
this
indeed
no
burke
had
made
his
own
bed
he
should
lie
in
it
deliberately
he
had
chosen
to
cast
aside
the
love
and
companionship
of
a
devoted
father
at
the
beck
of
an
almost
unknown
girl
hand
should
the
father
then
offer
again
the
love
and
companionship
had
he
no
pride
no
proper
sense
of
simple
right
and
justice
no
even
it
was
thus
and
by
arguments
such
as
these
that
john
denby
had
lashed
himself
into
the
state
of
apparently
cool
courteous
indifference
that
had
finally
carried
him
successfully
through
the
interview
just
closed
for
a
long
time
john
denby
sat
motionless
his
arms
outflung
across
the
letters
that
might
have
meant
so
much
but
that
did
mean
so
little
to
him
now
then
slowly
he
raised
his
head
and
fixed
somber
longing
eyes
on
the
door
that
had
so
recently
closed
behind
his
son
the
boy
was
in
there
with
brett
now
his
boy
he
was
being
told
that
his
wages
for
the
present
were
to
be
fifteen
dollars
a
week
and
that
he
was
expected
to
live
within
his
income
that
the
wages
were
really
very
liberal
considering
his
probable
value
to
the
company
at
the
first
he
begin
at
the
bottom
as
had
been
planned
years
ago
but
with
this
difference
he
would
be
promoted
now
only
when
he
had
earned
it
he
would
have
been
pushed
rapidly
ahead
to
the
top
had
matters
been
as
they
once
were
now
he
must
demonstrate
and
prove
his
ability
all
this
brett
was
telling
burke
now
poor
burke
brett
was
so
harsh
so
uncompromising
as
if
it
were
tough
enough
to
have
to
live
on
a
paltry
fifteen
dollars
a
week
without
john
denby
sighed
and
rose
to
his
feet
aimlessly
he
fidgeted
about
the
spacious
office
twice
he
turned
toward
the
door
as
if
to
leave
the
room
once
he
reached
a
hesitating
hand
toward
the
on
this
desk
then
determinedly
he
sat
down
and
picked
up
one
of
his
letters
brett
was
right
it
was
the
best
way
the
only
way
and
it
was
well
indeed
that
brett
had
been
delegated
to
do
the
telling
if
it
had
been
himself
now
shucks
if
it
had
been
himself
the
boy
would
only
have
had
to
his
reproach
and
his
wages
would
have
been
doubled
on
the
spot
fifteen
dollars
a
week
why
the
boy
could
not
well
then
he
need
not
have
been
so
foolish
so
headstrong
so
heartlessly
disregardful
of
his
father
wishes
he
had
brought
it
upon
himself
entirely
entirely
whereupon
with
an
angry
exclamation
john
denby
shifted
about
in
his
hand
the
letter
which
for
three
minutes
he
had
been
holding
before
his
eyes
upside
down
chapter
v
the
wife
helen
denby
had
never
doubted
her
ability
to
be
a
perfect
wife
as
a
girl
her
vision
had
pictured
a
beauteous
creature
moving
through
a
glorified
world
of
love
and
admiration
ease
and
affluence
later
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
to
burke
denby
her
vision
had
altered
sufficiently
to
present
a
picture
of
herself
as
the
sweet
of
the
old
denby
mansion
the
forgiving
young
wife
who
lays
up
no
malice
against
an
unappreciative
even
when
still
later
upon
their
return
from
their
wedding
trip
and
upon
her
learning
of
john
denby
decree
of
banishment
the
vision
was
necessarily
warped
and
twisted
all
out
of
semblance
to
its
original
outlines
there
yet
remained
unchanged
the
basic
idea
of
perfect
wifehood
helen
saw
herself
now
as
the
martyr
wife
whose
superb
courage
and
were
to
be
the
of
a
husband
magnificent
success
she
would
be
guide
counselor
and
friend
somewhere
she
had
seen
those
words
she
liked
them
very
much
unswervingly
she
would
hold
burke
to
his
high
purpose
untiringly
she
would
lead
him
ever
toward
his
goal
of
making
good
she
saw
herself
the
sweet
loving
wife
graciously
presiding
over
the
home
always
ready
daintily
gowned
to
welcome
his
coming
with
a
kiss
and
to
speed
his
going
with
a
blessing
then
when
in
due
course
he
had
won
out
great
would
be
her
reward
with
what
sweet
pride
and
gentle
dignity
would
she
accept
the
laurel
wreath
of
praise
helen
had
seen
this
expression
somewhere
too
and
liked
it
which
a
remorseful
but
grateful
world
would
hasten
to
lay
at
the
feet
of
her
who
alone
had
made
possible
the
splendid
victory
the
once
despised
flouted
wife
the
wife
who
was
to
drag
him
down
it
was
a
pleasant
picture
and
helen
frequently
dwelt
upon
it
especially
the
part
she
found
it
particularly
soothing
during
those
first
early
days
of
housekeeping
in
the
new
apartment
not
that
she
was
beginning
in
the
least
to
doubt
her
ability
to
be
that
perfect
wife
it
was
only
that
to
think
of
things
as
they
would
be
was
a
pleasant
distraction
from
thinking
of
things
as
they
were
but
of
course
it
would
be
all
right
very
soon
anyway
just
as
soon
as
everything
got
nicely
to
running
helen
did
wonder
sometimes
why
the
getting
of
everything
nicely
to
running
was
so
difficult
that
a
certain
amount
of
training
and
experience
was
necessary
to
bring
about
the
best
results
never
occurred
to
her
if
helen
had
been
asked
to
take
a
position
as
stenographer
or
church
soloist
she
would
have
replied
at
once
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
do
the
work
into
the
position
of
however
she
stepped
with
cheerful
confidence
her
eyes
only
on
the
wonderful
success
she
was
going
to
make
to
helen
housekeeping
was
something
like
a
clock
that
you
wound
up
in
the
morning
to
run
all
day
and
even
when
at
the
end
of
a
week
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
not
once
yet
had
she
got
around
to
being
the
sweet
daintily
gowned
wife
welcoming
her
husband
to
a
home
before
that
husband
appeared
at
the
door
she
still
did
not
doubt
her
own
capabilities
it
was
only
that
things
had
got
to
running
yet
and
it
was
always
somebody
else
fault
anyway
frequently
her
husband
for
if
he
did
not
come
to
dinner
too
early
before
a
thing
was
done
he
was
sure
to
be
late
and
thus
spoil
everything
by
her
trying
to
keep
things
hot
for
him
and
of
course
under
such
circumstances
nobody
could
one
to
be
a
sweet
and
daintily
gowned
wife
besides
there
was
the
cookbook
do
you
know
burke
she
finally
wailed
one
night
between
sobs
i
do
believe
it
good
for
a
thing
that
old
cookbook
i
have
got
a
thing
out
of
it
yet
that
been
real
good
i
half
a
mind
to
take
it
back
where
i
got
it
and
make
them
change
it
or
else
give
me
back
my
money
i
have
so
there
but
dearie
began
her
husband
doubtfully
you
said
yourself
yesterday
that
you
forgot
the
salt
in
the
omelet
and
the
baking
powder
in
the
cake
and
well
what
if
i
did
she
contended
aggrievedly
what
a
little
salt
or
baking
powder
was
but
a
pinch
or
a
spoonful
anyhow
and
i
remembered
all
the
other
things
besides
if
those
rules
were
any
good
they
be
worded
so
i
forget
part
of
the
things
and
anyhow
i
do
think
it
very
nice
of
you
to
me
all
the
time
when
doing
the
very
best
i
can
i
you
i
could
cook
but
you
you
like
anything
i
made
because
i
did
it
and
yes
yes
darling
and
so
i
do
interrupted
the
remorseful
husband
hurriedly
and
to
prove
it
he
ate
the
last
scrap
of
the
unappetizing
concoction
on
his
plate
which
his
wife
said
was
a
fish
croquette
afterwards
still
further
to
show
his
remorse
he
helped
her
wash
the
dishes
and
set
the
rooms
in
order
then
together
they
went
for
a
walk
in
the
moonlight
it
was
a
beautiful
walk
and
it
quite
restored
helen
to
good
nature
they
went
up
on
west
hill
where
helen
particularly
loved
to
go
and
they
laid
wonderful
plans
of
how
one
day
they
too
would
build
a
big
stone
palace
of
a
home
up
there
though
burke
did
say
that
for
his
part
he
liked
elm
hill
quite
as
well
but
helen
laughed
him
out
of
that
idea
at
least
he
said
no
more
about
it
they
talked
much
of
how
proud
burke
father
was
going
to
be
when
burke
had
made
good
and
of
how
ashamed
and
sorry
he
would
be
that
he
had
so
misjudged
his
son
wife
and
helen
uttered
some
very
sweet
and
beautiful
sentiments
concerning
her
intention
of
laying
up
no
malice
her
firm
determination
to
be
loving
and
forgiving
then
together
they
walked
home
in
the
moonlight
and
so
thrilled
and
exalted
were
they
that
even
the
cheap
little
dale
street
looked
wonderfully
dear
and
helen
said
that
after
all
love
was
the
only
thing
that
mattered
that
they
just
loved
each
other
and
burke
said
yes
yes
indeed
the
vision
of
the
sweet
daintily
gowned
wife
and
the
perfect
home
was
very
clear
to
helen
as
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
that
night
and
she
was
sure
that
she
could
begin
to
realize
it
at
once
but
unfortunately
she
overslept
the
next
morning
which
was
really
burke
fault
as
she
said
for
he
forgot
to
wind
the
alarm
clock
and
she
was
not
used
to
getting
up
at
such
an
unearthly
hour
anyway
and
she
did
not
see
why
had
to
do
it
for
that
matter
he
was
really
the
son
of
the
owner
even
if
he
was
an
apprentice
this
did
not
help
matters
any
for
burke
never
liked
any
reference
to
his
position
at
the
works
to
be
sure
he
did
not
say
much
this
time
except
to
observe
stiffly
that
he
like
his
breakfast
if
she
would
be
so
good
as
to
get
it
as
if
she
were
not
already
hurrying
as
fast
as
she
could
and
herself
only
at
that
of
course
the
breakfast
was
a
failure
helen
said
that
perhaps
some
people
could
get
a
meal
of
victuals
on
to
the
table
with
a
hungry
man
eyeing
their
every
move
but
she
could
not
burke
declared
then
that
he
really
did
not
want
any
breakfast
anyway
and
he
started
to
go
but
as
helen
only
cried
the
more
at
this
he
had
to
come
back
and
comfort
her
thereby
in
the
end
being
both
breakfastless
and
late
to
his
work
helen
after
he
had
gone
spent
a
blissfully
wretched
ten
minutes
weeping
over
the
sad
fate
that
should
doom
such
a
child
of
light
and
laughter
as
herself
to
the
somber
rôle
of
martyr
wife
and
wondered
if
after
all
it
would
not
be
really
more
impressive
and
more
for
the
cruel
if
she
should
take
poison
or
gas
or
something
not
disfiguring
and
lay
herself
calmly
down
to
die
her
beautiful
hands
crossed
meekly
upon
her
bosom
attractive
as
was
this
picture
in
some
respects
it
yet
had
its
drawbacks
then
too
there
was
the
laurel
wreath
of
praise
due
her
later
she
had
almost
forgotten
that
on
the
whole
that
would
be
preferable
to
the
poison
helen
decided
as
she
began
with
really
cheerful
alacrity
to
attack
the
messy
breakfast
dishes
it
was
not
alone
the
cooking
that
troubled
the
young
wife
during
that
first
month
of
housekeeping
everywhere
she
found
pitfalls
for
her
unwary
feet
from
managing
the
kitchen
range
to
keeping
the
dusted
and
there
was
the
money
helen
idea
of
money
in
her
happy
girlhood
had
been
that
it
was
one
of
the
common
necessities
of
life
and
she
accepted
it
as
she
did
the
sunshine
something
she
was
entitled
to
something
everybody
had
she
learned
the
fallacy
of
this
of
course
when
she
attempted
to
earn
her
own
living
but
in
marrying
the
son
of
the
rich
john
denby
she
had
expected
to
step
back
into
the
sunshine
as
it
were
it
was
not
easy
now
to
adjust
herself
to
the
change
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
asking
for
every
penny
she
spent
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
always
having
to
ask
burke
for
money
and
though
he
invariably
handed
it
over
with
a
nervously
quick
why
yes
certainly
i
do
mean
you
to
have
to
ask
for
it
helen
yet
she
thought
she
detected
a
growing
irritation
in
his
manner
each
time
and
on
the
last
occasion
he
had
added
a
dismayed
but
i
had
any
idea
you
could
have
got
out
so
soon
as
this
again
and
it
made
her
feel
very
uncomfortable
indeed
as
if
were
to
blame
that
it
took
so
much
butter
and
coffee
and
sugar
and
stuff
just
to
get
three
meals
a
day
and
as
if
it
were
her
fault
that
that
horrid
cookbook
was
always
calling
for
something
she
did
not
have
like
mace
or
summer
savory
or
thyme
and
she
had
to
run
out
and
buy
a
pound
of
it
did
he
suppose
it
took
money
to
stock
up
with
things
when
one
had
a
thing
to
begin
with
helen
had
been
on
the
point
of
saying
something
of
this
sort
to
her
husband
simply
as
a
matter
of
when
there
unexpectedly
came
a
most
delightful
solution
of
her
difficulty
it
was
the
grocer
who
pointed
the
way
why
do
you
open
an
account
with
us
mrs
denby
he
asked
smilingly
one
day
in
reply
to
her
usual
excuse
that
she
could
not
buy
something
because
she
did
not
have
the
money
to
pay
for
it
an
account
what
that
that
would
make
me
have
any
more
money
would
it
father
was
always
talking
about
accounts
good
ones
and
bad
ones
he
kept
a
store
you
know
but
i
never
knew
what
they
were
exactly
i
never
thought
of
asking
i
never
had
to
pay
any
attention
to
money
at
home
what
is
an
account
how
can
i
get
one
why
you
give
your
orders
as
usual
but
let
the
payment
go
until
the
end
of
the
month
smiled
the
grocer
we
charge
it
note
it
down
you
know
then
send
the
bill
to
your
husband
and
i
wo
have
to
ask
him
for
any
money
not
to
pay
us
the
man
lips
twitched
a
little
oh
that
would
be
just
grand
she
sighed
longingly
i
like
that
and
it
something
the
way
we
buying
our
furniture
it
installments
you
know
the
grocer
lips
twitched
again
er
only
we
send
a
bill
for
the
entire
month
and
he
pays
it
oh
i
see
that
just
grand
and
he
like
it
all
right
would
he
because
of
course
he
have
to
pay
some
time
anyhow
and
this
way
he
would
have
to
have
me
bothering
him
so
much
all
the
time
asking
for
money
oh
thank
you
you
very
kind
i
think
i
will
do
that
way
if
you
do
mind
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
denby
so
we
call
that
settled
and
now
you
can
begin
right
away
this
morning
and
can
i
get
those
canned
peaches
and
pears
and
plums
and
the
grape
jelly
that
i
first
looked
at
certainly
if
you
decide
you
want
mumbled
the
grocer
throwing
the
last
six
words
as
a
sop
to
his
conscience
which
was
beginning
to
stir
unpleasantly
oh
yes
i
want
averred
helen
her
eager
eyes
sweeping
the
alluringly
laden
shelves
before
her
i
wanted
them
all
the
time
you
know
only
i
did
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
them
now
it
be
all
right
because
burke
pay
i
mean
denby
she
corrected
with
a
conscious
blush
suddenly
remembering
what
her
husband
had
said
the
night
before
about
her
calling
him
burke
so
much
to
strangers
helen
found
she
wanted
not
only
the
fruits
and
jelly
but
several
other
cans
of
soups
meats
and
vegetables
and
it
was
such
a
comfort
for
once
to
select
what
she
wanted
and
not
have
to
count
up
the
money
in
her
purse
she
was
radiantly
happy
when
she
went
home
from
market
that
morning
instead
of
being
tired
and
worried
as
was
usually
the
case
and
the
glow
on
her
face
lasted
all
through
the
day
and
into
the
evening
so
much
so
that
even
burke
must
have
noticed
it
for
he
told
her
he
did
not
know
when
he
had
seen
her
looking
so
pretty
and
he
gave
her
an
extra
kiss
or
two
when
he
greeted
her
the
second
month
of
housekeeping
proved
to
be
a
great
improvement
over
the
first
it
was
early
in
that
month
that
helen
learned
the
joy
and
comfort
of
having
an
account
at
her
grocer
and
she
soon
discovered
that
not
yet
had
she
probed
this
delight
to
its
depths
for
not
only
the
grocer
but
the
fishman
and
the
butcher
were
equally
kind
and
allowed
her
to
open
accounts
with
them
coincident
with
this
came
the
discovery
that
there
were
such
institutions
as
bakeries
and
delicatessen
shops
which
seemed
to
have
been
designed
especially
to
meet
the
needs
of
just
such
harassed
little
martyr
housewives
as
she
herself
was
for
in
them
one
might
buy
bread
and
cakes
and
pies
and
even
salads
and
cold
meats
and
fish
balls
one
might
indeed
with
these
delectable
organizations
at
hand
snap
one
fingers
at
all
the
cookbooks
in
the
world
cookbooks
that
so
miserably
failed
to
cook
the
baker
and
the
little
dutch
delicatessen
man
too
when
they
found
out
who
she
was
expressed
themselves
as
delighted
to
open
an
account
and
with
the
disagreeable
necessity
eliminated
of
paying
on
the
spot
for
what
one
ordered
and
with
so
great
an
assortment
of
foods
to
select
from
helen
found
her
that
second
month
a
much
simpler
matter
then
too
helen
was
much
happier
now
that
she
did
not
have
to
ask
her
husband
for
money
she
accepted
what
he
gave
her
and
thanked
him
but
she
said
nothing
about
her
new
method
of
finance
i
going
to
keep
it
secret
till
the
stores
send
him
the
bills
said
helen
to
herself
then
i
show
him
what
a
lot
i
saved
from
what
he
has
given
me
and
he
be
so
glad
to
pay
things
all
at
once
without
being
bothered
with
my
everlasting
teasing
she
only
smiled
therefore
enigmatically
when
he
said
one
day
as
he
passed
over
the
money
jove
girl
i
quite
forgot
you
must
be
getting
low
but
i
glad
you
did
have
to
ask
me
for
it
anyhow
ask
him
for
it
indeed
how
pleased
he
would
be
when
he
found
out
that
she
was
never
going
to
ask
him
for
money
again
helen
was
meaning
to
be
very
economical
these
days
when
she
went
to
market
she
always
saw
several
things
she
would
have
liked
that
she
did
not
get
for
of
course
she
wanted
to
make
the
bills
as
small
as
she
could
naturally
burke
would
wish
her
to
do
that
she
tried
to
save
too
a
good
deal
of
the
money
burke
gave
her
but
that
was
not
always
possible
for
there
were
her
own
personal
expenses
true
she
did
not
need
many
clothes
but
she
was
able
to
pick
up
a
few
bargains
in
bows
and
collars
one
always
needed
fresh
neckwear
of
course
and
she
found
some
lovely
silk
stockings
too
that
were
very
cheap
so
she
bought
several
pairs
to
save
money
and
of
course
there
were
always
and
a
soda
now
and
then
or
a
little
candy
there
were
the
movies
too
she
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
going
rather
frequently
to
the
empire
with
her
neighbor
on
the
same
floor
it
did
her
good
and
got
her
out
of
herself
she
had
read
only
recently
how
every
wife
should
have
some
recreation
it
was
a
duty
she
owed
herself
and
her
husband
to
keep
herself
youthful
and
attractive
she
got
lonesome
and
nervous
sitting
at
home
all
day
and
now
that
she
had
systematized
her
housekeeping
so
beautifully
by
buying
almost
everything
all
cooked
she
had
plenty
of
leisure
of
course
she
would
have
preferred
to
go
to
the
olympia
theater
they
had
a
stock
company
there
and
real
plays
but
their
cheapest
seats
were
cents
while
she
might
go
to
the
empire
for
ten
so
very
bravely
she
put
aside
her
expensive
longings
and
chose
the
better
part
economy
and
the
movies
besides
jones
the
neighbor
on
the
same
floor
said
that
for
her
part
she
liked
the
movies
the
best
you
got
such
a
powerful
lot
more
for
your
dough
jones
always
had
something
bright
and
original
like
that
to
say
helen
liked
her
very
much
indeed
she
told
burke
one
day
that
jones
was
almost
as
good
as
a
movie
show
herself
burke
however
did
not
seem
to
care
for
jones
for
that
matter
he
did
not
care
for
the
movies
either
no
matter
where
helen
went
in
the
afternoon
she
was
always
very
careful
to
be
at
home
before
burke
she
hoped
she
knew
what
pertained
to
being
a
perfect
wife
better
than
to
be
careless
about
matters
like
that
jones
was
not
always
so
particular
in
regard
to
her
husband
which
only
served
to
give
helen
a
pleasant
warm
little
feeling
of
superiority
at
the
difference
perhaps
jones
detected
the
superiority
for
sometimes
she
laughed
and
said
all
right
we
go
if
you
must
but
you
soon
get
over
it
this
business
is
all
very
well
for
a
while
but
you
wait
all
right
i
waiting
but
you
see
helen
always
laughed
back
bridling
prettily
hurrying
home
from
shopping
or
the
theater
therefore
helen
always
stopped
and
got
her
potato
salad
and
cold
meat
or
whatever
else
she
needed
and
the
meal
was
invariably
on
the
table
before
burke
key
sounded
in
the
lock
helen
was
indeed
feeling
quite
as
if
she
were
beginning
to
realize
her
vision
now
was
she
not
each
night
the
loving
daintily
gowned
wife
welcoming
her
husband
to
a
attractive
home
there
was
even
quite
frequently
a
bouquet
of
flowers
on
the
dinner
table
somewhere
she
had
read
that
flowers
always
added
much
to
a
meal
and
since
then
she
had
bought
them
when
she
felt
that
she
could
afford
them
and
in
the
market
there
were
almost
always
some
cheap
ones
only
a
little
faded
of
course
she
never
bought
the
fresh
expensive
ones
after
dinner
there
was
the
long
evening
together
sometimes
they
went
to
walk
after
the
dishes
were
done
burke
had
learned
to
dry
dishes
beautifully
more
often
they
stayed
at
home
and
played
games
or
read
burke
was
always
wanting
to
read
sometimes
they
just
talked
laying
wonderful
plans
about
the
fine
new
house
they
were
going
to
build
now
that
helen
did
not
have
to
ask
burke
for
money
there
did
not
seem
to
be
so
many
occasions
when
he
was
fretful
and
nervous
and
they
were
much
happier
together
all
things
considered
therefore
helen
felt
indeed
before
this
second
month
of
housekeeping
was
over
that
she
had
now
got
things
nicely
to
running
chapter
vi
the
husband
burke
denby
had
never
given
any
thought
as
to
whether
he
were
going
to
be
a
perfect
husband
or
not
he
had
wanted
to
marry
helen
and
he
had
married
her
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
except
of
course
that
they
had
got
to
show
his
father
that
they
could
make
good
so
far
as
being
a
husband
good
bad
or
indifferent
was
concerned
burke
was
not
giving
any
more
thought
to
it
now
than
he
had
given
before
his
marriage
he
was
quite
too
busy
giving
thought
to
other
matters
many
other
matters
there
was
first
his
work
he
hated
it
he
hated
the
noise
the
smell
the
grime
the
overalls
the
men
he
worked
with
the
smug
superciliousness
of
his
especial
boss
he
felt
abused
and
indignant
that
he
had
to
endure
it
all
as
if
it
were
necessary
to
put
him
through
such
a
course
of
sprouts
as
this
as
if
when
the
time
came
he
could
not
run
the
business
successfully
without
all
these
years
of
dirt
and
torture
was
an
engineer
then
made
to
an
engine
before
he
could
be
taught
to
handle
the
throttle
was
a
child
made
to
set
the
type
of
a
primer
before
he
could
be
taught
his
letters
of
course
not
but
they
were
making
him
not
only
set
the
type
but
go
down
into
the
mines
and
dig
the
stuff
the
type
was
made
of
before
they
would
teach
him
his
letters
yet
they
pretended
it
all
must
be
done
if
he
would
ever
learn
to
read
that
is
to
run
the
denby
iron
works
bah
he
had
a
mind
to
chuck
it
all
he
would
if
it
were
for
dad
dad
hated
quitters
and
dad
was
looking
wretched
enough
as
it
was
and
that
was
another
thing
dad
undeniably
burke
was
very
unhappy
over
his
father
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
him
yet
his
face
was
always
before
him
pale
and
drawn
as
he
had
seen
it
at
that
first
interview
after
his
return
as
the
days
passed
burke
in
spite
of
his
wish
not
to
see
his
father
found
himself
continually
seizing
every
opportunity
that
might
enable
him
to
see
him
daily
he
found
himself
haunting
doorways
and
corridors
quite
out
of
his
way
when
there
was
a
chance
that
his
father
might
pass
he
told
himself
that
it
was
just
that
he
wanted
to
convince
himself
that
his
father
did
not
look
quite
so
bad
after
all
but
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
it
was
because
he
hoped
his
father
would
speak
to
him
in
the
old
way
and
that
it
might
lead
to
the
tearing
down
of
this
horrible
high
wall
of
indifference
and
formality
that
had
risen
between
them
burke
hated
that
wall
the
wall
was
there
however
always
nothing
ever
came
of
these
connivings
and
loiterings
except
if
it
were
during
working
hours
a
terse
hint
from
the
foreman
perhaps
to
get
back
on
his
job
how
burke
hated
that
foreman
and
that
was
another
thing
his
position
among
his
fellow
workmen
he
was
with
them
but
not
of
them
his
being
among
them
at
all
was
plainly
a
huge
joke
and
when
one
is
acting
a
tragedy
in
all
seriousness
one
does
not
like
to
hear
chuckles
as
at
a
comedy
but
for
that
matter
burke
found
the
comedy
element
always
present
wherever
he
went
the
entire
town
took
himself
his
work
and
his
marriage
as
a
huge
joke
a
subject
for
gay
badinage
jocose
slaps
on
the
back
and
gleeful
cries
of
well
denby
how
goes
it
how
doth
the
happy
bridegroom
and
burke
hated
that
too
it
seemed
to
burke
indeed
sometimes
that
he
hated
everything
but
helen
helen
of
course
was
a
dear
the
sweetest
little
wife
in
the
world
as
if
any
one
could
help
loving
helen
and
however
disagreeable
the
day
there
was
always
helen
to
go
home
to
at
night
oh
of
course
he
had
to
take
that
abominable
flat
along
with
helen
naturally
as
long
as
he
could
not
afford
to
put
her
in
a
more
expensive
place
but
that
would
soon
be
remedied
just
as
soon
as
he
got
a
little
ahead
this
going
home
to
helen
had
been
one
of
burke
happiest
anticipations
ever
since
his
marriage
it
would
be
so
entrancing
to
find
helen
and
helen
kiss
waiting
for
him
each
night
often
had
such
thoughts
been
in
his
mind
during
his
honeymoon
trip
but
never
had
they
been
so
poignantly
promising
of
joy
as
they
were
on
that
first
day
at
the
works
after
his
disheartening
interview
with
his
father
all
the
rest
of
that
miserable
day
it
seemed
to
burke
that
the
only
thing
he
was
living
for
was
the
going
home
to
helen
that
night
home
to
burke
had
always
meant
a
place
of
peace
and
rest
of
luxurious
ease
and
noiseless
servants
of
orderly
rooms
and
meals
of
mellow
lights
and
softly
blended
colors
unconsciously
now
home
still
meant
the
same
with
the
addition
of
helen
helen
the
center
of
it
all
it
was
this
dear
vision
therefore
that
he
treasured
all
through
his
honeymoon
trip
that
he
hugged
to
himself
all
that
wretched
first
day
of
work
and
that
was
still
his
star
of
hope
as
he
hurried
that
night
toward
the
dale
street
flat
if
he
had
stopped
to
think
he
would
have
realized
at
once
that
this
new
home
of
a
day
was
not
the
old
home
of
years
but
he
did
not
stop
to
think
of
anything
except
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
going
home
from
work
to
helen
his
wife
burke
denby
never
forgot
the
shock
of
that
first
he
opened
the
door
of
his
apartment
and
confronted
chaos
a
surly
janitor
struggling
with
a
curtain
pole
a
confusion
of
trunks
chairs
a
stepladder
and
a
a
disorder
of
dishes
on
a
coverless
table
a
smell
of
burned
milk
and
a
cross
tired
untidy
wife
who
flung
herself
into
his
arms
with
a
storm
of
sobs
home
after
that
meant
quite
something
new
to
burke
denby
it
meant
helen
of
course
but
still
it
would
be
only
for
a
little
while
after
all
he
consoled
himself
each
day
just
as
soon
as
he
got
ahead
a
little
it
would
be
different
he
could
sell
the
stuff
then
and
the
very
first
thing
to
go
would
be
that
hideous
purple
pillow
on
the
red
plush
sofa
for
that
matter
the
sofa
would
follow
after
mighty
quick
and
the
chairs
too
they
were
a
little
worse
to
sit
on
than
to
look
at
which
was
unnecessary
as
for
the
rugs
when
it
came
to
those
it
would
be
his
turn
to
select
next
time
at
all
events
he
would
not
be
obliged
to
have
one
that
the
minute
you
opened
the
door
bounced
into
your
face
and
screamed
hullo
i
here
see
me
how
he
hated
that
rug
and
the
pictures
and
those
cheap
gilt
vases
everything
of
course
would
be
different
in
the
new
home
nor
did
burke
stop
to
think
that
this
constant
shifting
in
one
mind
of
things
that
are
to
things
that
may
some
time
be
scarcely
makes
for
content
still
burke
could
not
have
forgotten
his
even
if
he
had
tried
to
do
so
for
he
had
to
make
payments
on
them
every
few
minutes
as
he
termed
it
indeed
one
of
the
unsolved
riddles
of
his
life
these
days
was
as
to
why
there
were
so
many
more
mondays
the
day
he
paid
his
installments
than
there
were
saturdays
the
day
the
works
paid
him
in
a
week
for
that
matter
after
all
was
said
and
done
perhaps
to
nothing
was
burke
denby
giving
more
thought
these
days
than
to
money
burke
experience
with
money
heretofore
had
been
to
draw
a
check
for
what
he
wanted
true
he
sometimes
overdrew
his
account
a
trifle
but
there
was
always
his
allowance
coming
the
first
of
the
month
and
neither
he
nor
the
bank
worried
now
it
was
quite
different
there
was
no
allowance
and
no
bank
save
his
pocket
and
there
was
only
fifteen
dollars
a
week
coming
into
that
he
would
not
have
believed
that
fifteen
dollars
a
week
could
go
so
quickly
and
buy
so
little
very
early
in
the
first
month
of
housekeeping
all
that
remained
of
his
allowance
was
gone
what
did
not
go
at
once
to
make
payments
on
the
furniture
was
paid
over
to
helen
to
satisfy
some
of
her
many
requests
for
money
and
that
was
another
of
burke
riddles
why
helen
needed
so
much
money
just
to
get
them
something
to
eat
true
of
late
she
had
not
asked
for
it
so
frequently
she
had
not
indeed
asked
for
any
for
some
time
for
which
he
was
devoutly
thankful
he
would
not
have
liked
to
refuse
her
and
he
certainly
was
giving
her
all
that
he
could
afford
to
give
without
her
asking
a
fellow
must
smoke
some
though
heaven
knew
he
had
cut
his
cigars
down
both
in
quantity
and
quality
until
he
had
cut
out
nearly
all
the
pleasure
still
he
was
glad
to
do
it
for
helen
helen
was
a
little
brick
how
pretty
she
looked
when
she
was
holding
forth
on
his
making
good
and
her
not
dragging
him
down
bless
her
heart
as
if
she
could
be
guilty
of
such
a
thing
as
that
why
she
was
going
to
drag
him
up
helen
was
and
she
was
doing
pretty
well
too
running
the
little
home
for
a
girl
who
did
not
know
a
thing
about
it
to
begin
with
she
was
doing
a
whole
lot
better
than
at
first
breakfast
had
not
been
late
for
two
weeks
nor
dinner
either
and
she
was
almost
always
at
the
door
to
kiss
him
now
too
while
at
the
first
he
had
to
hunt
her
up
only
to
find
her
crying
in
the
kitchen
probably
something
wrong
somewhere
oh
to
be
sure
he
getting
a
little
tired
of
potato
salad
and
he
always
had
abhorred
those
things
and
he
himself
did
not
care
much
for
cold
meat
but
of
course
after
she
got
a
little
more
used
to
things
she
would
serve
that
sort
of
trash
quite
so
often
he
would
be
getting
real
things
to
eat
pretty
soon
good
juicy
beefsteaks
and
roasts
and
nice
fresh
vegetables
and
fruit
shortcakes
with
muffins
and
for
breakfast
but
helen
was
a
little
brick
helen
was
and
she
was
doing
splendidly
chapter
vii
burke
denby
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
number
of
letters
directed
to
her
husband
in
the
morning
mail
that
first
day
of
november
until
she
noticed
the
familiar
names
in
the
upper
corners
of
several
of
the
envelopes
oh
it
the
bills
she
murmured
drawing
in
her
breath
a
little
uncertainly
the
first
and
they
said
they
send
them
then
but
i
did
think
there
be
such
a
lot
of
them
still
i
had
things
at
all
those
places
well
anyway
he
be
glad
to
pay
them
all
at
once
without
my
teasing
for
money
all
the
time
she
finished
with
resolute
insistence
as
she
turned
back
to
her
work
if
now
that
the
time
had
come
and
the
bills
lay
before
her
in
all
their
fearsome
reality
helen
was
beginning
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
her
financial
system
she
would
not
admit
it
even
to
herself
and
she
still
wore
a
determinedly
cheerful
face
when
her
husband
came
home
to
dinner
that
night
she
went
into
the
kitchen
as
he
began
to
open
his
mail
she
was
reminded
of
a
sudden
something
that
needed
her
attention
two
minutes
later
she
nearly
dropped
the
dish
of
potato
salad
she
was
carrying
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
from
the
doorway
helen
what
in
heaven
name
is
the
meaning
of
these
bills
he
was
in
the
kitchen
now
holding
out
a
sheaf
of
tightly
clutched
papers
in
each
hand
helen
set
the
potato
salad
down
hastily
why
burke
do
do
look
at
me
so
but
what
does
this
mean
what
are
these
things
why
they
they
just
bills
i
suppose
they
they
be
bills
great
cæsar
helen
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
know
about
them
that
you
bought
all
this
stuff
helen
lip
began
to
quiver
burke
do
please
do
look
like
that
you
frighten
me
frighten
you
what
do
you
think
of
springing
a
thing
like
this
why
burke
i
i
thought
you
it
it
that
i
did
have
to
ask
you
for
money
all
the
time
and
have
to
some
time
anyhow
we
had
to
eat
you
know
but
great
scott
helen
we
are
a
hotel
look
at
that
he
exploded
pointing
a
shaking
finger
at
a
series
of
items
on
the
uppermost
bill
in
his
left
hand
tons
of
the
stuff
there
and
i
always
did
abominate
it
why
burke
i
i
and
the
floods
came
oh
thunderation
helen
helen
do
please
do
but
i
thought
i
was
going
to
you
and
you
called
me
a
and
said
you
it
she
wailed
stumbling
away
blindly
with
a
despairing
ejaculation
burke
flung
the
bills
to
the
floor
and
caught
the
little
figure
of
his
wife
in
his
arms
there
there
i
was
a
brute
and
i
did
mean
it
not
a
word
of
it
sweetheart
do
please
do
he
begged
why
girlie
all
the
bills
in
christendom
are
worth
a
tear
from
your
dear
eyes
come
you
stop
but
helen
did
not
stop
at
once
the
storm
was
short
but
tempestuous
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
however
together
they
went
into
the
helen
carried
the
potato
salad
which
burke
declared
he
was
really
hungry
for
and
burke
carried
the
bills
crumpled
in
one
hand
behind
his
back
his
other
arm
around
his
wife
waist
that
evening
a
remorseful
wife
and
a
husband
with
an
air
went
over
the
subject
of
household
finances
and
came
to
an
understanding
there
were
to
be
no
more
charge
accounts
for
the
weekly
expenses
helen
was
to
have
every
cent
that
could
possibly
be
spared
but
what
she
could
not
pay
cash
for
they
must
go
without
if
they
starved
in
a
pretty
little
book
she
must
put
down
on
one
side
the
money
received
on
the
other
the
money
spent
she
was
a
dear
good
little
wife
and
he
loved
her
to
death
but
he
could
let
her
run
up
bills
when
he
had
not
a
red
cent
to
pay
them
with
he
would
borrow
of
course
for
these
he
was
not
going
to
have
any
dirty
little
tradesmen
pestering
him
with
bills
all
the
time
but
this
must
be
the
last
never
again
and
helen
said
yes
yes
indeed
and
she
was
very
sure
she
would
love
to
keep
the
pretty
little
book
and
put
down
all
the
money
she
got
and
all
she
spent
all
this
was
very
well
in
theory
but
in
practice
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
helen
brought
her
book
to
her
husband
and
spread
it
open
before
him
with
great
gusto
on
the
one
side
were
several
entries
of
small
sums
amounting
to
eight
dollars
received
on
the
other
side
were
the
words
spent
all
but
seventeen
cents
oh
but
you
should
put
down
what
you
spent
it
for
corrected
burke
with
a
merry
laugh
why
why
er
so
you
can
see
er
what
the
money
goes
for
what
the
difference
if
it
goes
oh
shucks
you
ca
keep
a
cash
account
that
way
you
have
to
put
both
down
and
then
er
balance
up
and
see
if
your
cash
comes
right
see
like
this
he
cried
taking
a
little
book
from
his
pocket
keeping
one
and
he
pointed
to
a
little
list
which
read
lunch
cigar
paper
helen
cigars
paper
now
that
what
i
spent
yesterday
you
want
to
put
yours
down
like
that
then
add
up
and
subtract
it
from
what
you
receive
what
left
should
equal
your
cash
on
hand
well
all
right
assented
helen
dubiously
as
she
picked
up
her
own
little
book
helen
looked
still
more
dubious
when
she
presented
her
book
for
inspection
the
next
week
i
do
think
i
like
it
this
way
she
announced
with
a
pout
why
not
why
burke
the
mean
old
thing
steals
actually
steals
it
says
i
ought
to
have
one
dollar
and
cents
and
i
have
got
but
fourteen
cents
it
got
it
itself
somewhere
ho
that
easy
dear
the
man
gave
an
indulgent
laugh
you
put
all
down
what
you
spent
but
i
did
everything
i
could
remember
besides
i
borrowed
fifty
cents
of
jones
i
did
put
that
down
anywhere
i
did
know
where
to
put
it
helen
you
borrowed
money
of
that
woman
she
is
woman
she
my
friend
and
i
like
her
flared
helen
hotly
i
had
to
have
some
eggs
and
i
did
have
a
cent
of
money
i
shall
pay
her
back
of
course
next
time
you
pay
me
burke
frowned
oh
come
come
helen
this
will
never
do
he
remonstrated
of
course
you
pay
her
back
but
i
ca
have
my
wife
borrowing
of
the
neighbors
but
i
had
to
i
had
to
have
some
eggs
she
choked
and
yes
yes
i
know
but
i
mean
we
wo
again
interrupted
the
man
desperately
fleeing
to
cover
in
the
face
of
the
threatening
storm
of
sobs
and
anyhow
we
see
that
you
have
some
money
now
he
cried
gayly
plunging
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
pulling
out
all
the
bills
and
change
he
had
there
all
my
worldly
goods
i
thee
endow
he
laughed
lifting
his
hands
above
her
bright
head
and
showering
the
money
all
over
her
like
children
then
they
scrambled
for
the
rolling
nickels
and
elusive
dimes
and
in
the
ensuing
frolic
the
tiresome
was
forgotten
which
was
exactly
what
burke
had
hoped
would
happen
this
was
the
second
week
at
the
end
of
the
third
the
mean
old
thing
was
in
a
worse
muddle
than
ever
according
to
helen
and
for
her
part
she
would
rather
never
buy
anything
at
all
if
she
had
got
to
go
and
tell
that
nuisance
of
a
book
every
time
the
fourth
saturday
night
helen
did
not
produce
the
book
at
all
oh
i
do
keep
that
any
longer
she
announced
with
airy
nonchalance
in
answer
to
burke
question
it
never
came
right
and
i
hated
it
anyhow
so
what
the
use
i
got
what
i
got
and
spent
what
i
spent
so
what
the
difference
and
burke
after
a
feeble
remonstrance
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
incidentally
it
might
be
mentioned
that
burke
was
having
a
little
difficulty
with
his
own
cash
account
and
was
tempted
to
accuse
his
own
book
of
stealing
else
where
did
the
money
go
it
was
the
next
monday
night
that
burke
came
home
with
a
radiant
countenance
gleason
here
up
at
the
hancock
house
he
coming
down
after
dinner
who
gleason
helen
tone
was
a
little
fretful
there
was
a
new
intangible
something
in
her
husband
voice
that
helen
did
not
understand
and
that
she
did
not
think
she
liked
gleason
who
doc
gleason
exclaimed
burke
with
widening
eyes
oh
i
forgot
you
do
know
him
do
you
he
added
with
a
slight
frown
burke
denby
was
always
forgetting
that
helen
knew
nothing
of
his
friends
or
of
himself
until
less
than
a
year
before
well
doc
gleason
is
the
best
ever
he
went
to
egypt
with
us
last
year
and
to
alaska
the
year
before
how
old
is
he
old
why
i
do
know
thirty
maybe
more
he
must
be
a
little
more
come
to
think
of
it
but
you
never
think
of
age
with
the
doctor
be
young
when
he
ninety
and
you
like
him
so
well
her
voice
was
a
little
wistful
next
to
dad
always
have
you
like
him
too
you
ca
help
it
mighty
interesting
and
he
a
doctor
yes
and
no
oh
he
graduated
and
hung
out
his
shingle
but
he
never
practiced
much
he
had
money
enough
anyway
and
he
got
interested
in
scientific
research
antiquarian
mostly
though
he
done
a
bit
of
and
for
the
national
geographic
society
antiquarian
oh
yes
i
know
old
things
mother
was
that
way
too
she
had
an
old
pewter
plate
and
a
dark
blue
china
teapot
homely
as
a
hedge
fence
i
thought
but
she
doted
on
and
she
doted
on
ancestors
too
she
had
one
in
that
old
ship
mayflower
was
it
burke
laughed
mayflower
my
dear
child
the
mayflower
is
a
mere
in
the
doctor
estimation
the
doctor
goes
back
to
prehistoric
times
for
his
playground
and
to
the
men
of
the
old
stone
age
for
his
preferred
playmates
older
than
the
mayflower
then
a
trifle
some
thousands
of
years
goodness
how
can
he
i
thought
the
mayflower
was
bad
enough
but
what
does
he
do
collect
things
yes
to
some
extent
he
has
a
fine
collection
of
babylonian
tablets
and
oh
i
know
those
funny
little
brown
and
yellow
cakes
like
soap
all
cut
into
with
pointed
little
marks
what
do
you
call
it
like
your
father
has
in
his
library
the
cuneiform
writing
yes
as
i
said
the
doctor
has
a
fine
collection
of
tablets
and
of
some
other
things
but
principally
he
studies
and
goes
on
trips
it
was
a
trip
to
the
spanish
grottoes
that
got
him
interested
in
the
archæological
business
in
the
first
place
and
put
him
out
of
conceit
with
doctoring
he
goes
a
lot
now
sometimes
independently
sometimes
in
the
interest
of
some
society
he
does
in
a
scientific
way
what
dad
and
i
have
done
for
fun
traveling
and
collecting
i
mean
then
too
he
has
written
a
book
or
two
which
are
really
authoritative
in
their
line
he
a
great
chap
the
doctor
is
wait
till
you
see
him
i
told
him
about
you
too
then
you
told
him
that
is
he
knows
about
the
marriage
why
sure
he
does
burke
manner
was
a
bit
impatient
what
do
you
suppose
when

here
now

on
your
prettiest
frock
and
your
sweetest
smile
i
want
him
to
see

challenged
banteringly
i
want

to
see

treasure

course

could
without
your
knowing
beforehand
mercy
no
burke
shuddered
the
young
housekeeper
do
you
dare
when
i
do
know
it
but
if
you
do
know
it
he
paused
hopefully
why
i
guess
so
of
course
i
could
get
things
i
was
sure
of
like
potato
salad
and
burke
sat
back
in
his
chair
but
helen
i
afraid
i
do
think
that
is
i
sure
gleason
does
like
potato
salad
he
stammered
does
he
well
he
need
eat
it
then
we
have
all
the
more
left
for
the
next
day
but
helen
er
oh
i
have
chips
too
do
worry
dear
i
give
him
something
to
eat
she
promised
gayly
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
have
one
of
your
swell
friends
come
here
and
then
have
you
ashamed
of
me
you
just
wait
and
see
er
no
no
indeed
of
course
not
plunged
in
her
husband
feverishly
trying
to
ward
off
a
repetition
of
the
swell
a
word
he
particularly
abhorred
several
times
in
the
last
two
months
he
had
heard
helen
use
this
word
twice
when
she
had
informed
him
with
great
glee
that
some
swell
friends
of
his
from
elm
hill
had
come
in
their
carriage
to
call
and
again
quite
often
when
together
on
the
street
they
met
some
one
whom
he
knew
he
thought
he
hated
the
word
a
little
more
bitterly
every
time
he
heard
it
for
several
weeks
now
the
denbys
had
been
receiving
calls
burke
denby
was
a
denby
of
denby
mansion
even
though
he
was
temporarily
marooned
on
dale
street
at
a
salary
of
sixty
dollars
a
month
besides
to
many
dale
street
and
the
sixty
dollars
with
the
contributory
elements
of
elopement
and
irate
parent
only
added
piquancy
and
interest
to
what
would
otherwise
have
been
nothing
but
the
conventional
duty
call
to
helen
in
the
main
these
calls
were
a
welcome
diversion
just
grand
indeed
to
burke
on
whom
the
curiosity
element
was
not
lost
they
were
an
impertinence
and
a
nuisance
yet
he
endured
them
and
even
welcomed
them
in
a
way
for
he
wanted
helen
to
know
his
friends
and
to
like
them
better
than
she
liked
jones
he
did
not
care
for
jones
she
talked
too
loud
and
used
too
much
slang
he
did
not
like
to
have
helen
with
her
always
therefore
after
callers
had
been
there
his
first
eager
question
was
how
did
you
like
them
dear
he
wanted
so
much
that
helen
should
like
them
however
in
thinking
of
the
prospective
visit
from
gleason
he
was
wondering
how
the
doctor
would
like
helen
not
how
helen
would
like
the
doctor
the
change
was
significant
but
unconscious
perhaps
all
the
more
significant
because
it
was
unconscious
until
he
had
reached
home
that
night
burke
had
been
so
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
an
chat
with
his
friend
that
he
had
given
little
thought
to
gleason
probable
opinion
of
the
dale
street
flat
and
its
furnishings
now
with
his
eyes
on
the
obtrusive
unharmony
all
about
him
and
his
memory
going
back
to
the
doctor
fastidiousness
of
taste
he
could
think
of
little
else
he
did
hope
gleason
would
not
think
had
selected
those
horrors
of
course
he
had
already
explained
a
little
about
his
father
disapproval
of
the
marriage
and
the
resulting
of
his
allowance
but
even
that
would
not
excuse
to
gleason
the
riot
of
glaring
reds
and
pinks
and
purples
in
his
and
one
could
not
very
well
explain
that
one
wife
the
horrors
he
pulled
himself
up
sharply
of
course
helen
herself
was
a
dear
he
hoped
gleason
would
see
how
dear
she
was
he
wanted
gleason
to
like
helen
as
the
hour
drew
near
for
the
expected
guest
arrival
burke
denby
greatly
to
his
vexation
found
himself
growing
more
and
more
nervous
he
asked
himself
indignantly
if
he
were
going
to
let
a
purple
cushion
entirely
spoil
the
pleasure
of
the
evening
not
until
he
had
seen
gleason
that
afternoon
had
he
realized
how
sorely
he
had
missed
his
father
companionship
all
these
past
weeks
not
until
he
had
found
himself
bubbling
over
with
the
things
he
wanted
to
talk
about
that
evening
had
he
realized
how
keenly
he
had
missed
the
mental
stimulus
of
that
father
comradeship
and
now
for
the
sake
of
a
purple
cushion
was
he
to
lose
the
only
chance
he
had
had
for
weeks
of
conversing
with
an
intelligent
with
an
almost
audible
gasp
the
shocked
and
shamed
husband
pulled
himself
up
again
well
of
course
helen
was
intelligent
it
was
only
that
she
was
not
interested
in
and
did
not
know
about
these
things
he
was
thinking
of
and
the
doorbell
rang
sharply
and
burke
leaped
to
his
feet
and
hastened
to
press
the
button
that
would
release
the
catch
of
the
lock
at
the
entrance
below
why
burke
you
never
called
down
through
the
tube
at
all
and
asked
who
it
was
remonstrated
helen
hurrying
in
her
fingers
busy
with
the
final
fastenings
of
her
dress
you
bet
your
life
i
did
laughed
burke
a
bit
grimly
you
got
another
guess
coming
if
you
think
i
going
to
hold
doc
gleason
off
at
the
end
of
a
is
it
bellowed
into
his
ear
from
that
impertinent
copper
trumpet
down
there
why
burke
that
all
right
everybody
does
it
maintained
helen
we
have
to
else
we
be
letting
all
sorts
of
folks
in
and
at
a
warning
gesture
from
her
husband
she
stopped
just
as
a
tall
man
with
kind
eyes
and
a
grave
smile
appeared
at
the
open
hallway
door
glad
to
see
you
doctor
cried
burke
extending
a
cordial
hand
that
yet
trembled
a
little
let
me
present
you
to
my
wife
pleased
to
meet
you
i
sure
bobbed
helen
and
because
she
was
nervous
she
said
the
next
thing
that
came
into
her
head
and
i
hope
you
pleased
to
meet
me
too
all
burke
friends
are
so
swell
you
know
that
er
ah
broke
in
the
dismayed
husband
but
the
visitor
advanced
quietly
still
with
that
same
grave
smile
and
clasped
denby
extended
hand
i
am
very
sure
burke
friends
are
indeed
very
glad
to
meet
you
he
said
certainly
i
am
he
finished
with
a
cordial
heartiness
so
nicely
balanced
that
even
burke
denby
sensitive
alertness
could
find
in
it
neither
the
overzealousness
of
insincerity
nor
the
indifference
of
disdain
even
when
a
minute
later
they
turned
and
went
into
the
living
room
burke
still
apprehensive
watchfulness
could
detect
in
his
face
not
one
trace
of
the
dismayed
horror
he
had
been
dreading
to
see
there
gleason
a
brick
he
sighed
to
himself
trying
to
relax
his
tense
muscles
as
if
i
did
know
that
every
last
gimcrack
in
this
miserable
room
would
fairly
scream
at
him
the
moment
he
entered
that
door
in
spite
of
everybody
very
evident
efforts
to
have
everything
pass
off
pleasantly
the
evening
was
anything
but
a
success
helen
at
first
shy
and
ill
at
ease
said
little
then
as
if
suddenly
realizing
her
deficiencies
as
a
hostess
she
tried
to
remedy
it
by
talking
very
loud
and
very
fast
about
anything
that
came
into
her
mind
reveling
especially
in
minute
details
concerning
their
own
daily
lives
ranging
all
the
way
from
stories
of
the
elopement
and
the
on
the
installment
plan
to
hilarious
accounts
of
her
experiences
with
the
cookbook
and
the
very
plainly
helen
was
doing
her
best
to
show
off
from
one
to
the
other
she
looked
with
little
nods
and
coquettish
smiles
to
gleason
her
manner
said
you
see
now
why
burke
fell
in
love
with
me
do
you
to
burke
it
said
there
now
i
guess
you
ai
ashamed
of
me
the
doctor
still
with
the
grave
smile
and
kindly
eyes
listened
politely
uttering
now
and
then
a
pleasant
word
or
two
in
a
way
that
even
the
distraught
husband
could
not
criticize
as
for
the
husband
himself
between
his
anger
at
helen
and
his
anger
at
himself
because
of
his
anger
at
helen
he
was
in
a
woeful
condition
of
nervousness
and
vainly
trying
to
wrest
the
ball
of
conversation
from
bungling
fingers
he
yet
felt
obliged
to
laugh
in
apparent
approval
at
her
wild
throws
nor
was
he
unaware
of
the
sorry
figure
he
thus
made
of
himself
having
long
since
given
up
all
hope
of
the
anticipated
chat
with
his
friend
his
one
aim
now
was
to
get
the
visit
over
and
the
doctor
out
of
the
house
as
soon
as
possible
yet
the
very
fact
that
he
did
want
the
visit
over
and
the
doctor
gone
only
angered
him
the
more
and
put
into
his
mouth
words
that
were
a
mockery
of
cordiality
no
wonder
then
that
for
burke
the
evening
was
a
series
of
fidgetings
and
nervous
laughs
that
if
he
had
but
known
it
were
fully
as
distressing
to
the
doctor
as
they
were
to
himself
at
nine
the
doctor
rose
to
his
feet
well
good
people
i
must
go
he
announced
cheerily
for
the
last
the
doctor
had
been
wondering
just
how
soon
he
might
make
that
statement
it
nine
pshaw
that
ai
late
protested
helen
no
indeed
echoed
burke
though
burke
had
promptly
risen
with
his
guest
perhaps
not
to
you
but
to
me
the
doctor
let
a
smile
finish
his
sentence
but
you
coming
again
gurgled
helen
you
coming
to
dinner
burke
said
you
was
burke
mouth
flew
open
but
just
in
time
he
snapped
it
shut
he
had
remembered
that
hospitable
husbands
do
not
usually
retract
their
invitations
with
a
terrified
for
heaven
sake
no
at
least
not
in
the
face
of
the
prospective
guest
before
he
could
put
the
new
proper
words
into
his
mouth
the
doctor
spoke
thank
you
you
very
kind
but
i
afraid
not
this
time
denby
my
stay
is
to
be
very
short
but
i
glad
to
have
had
this
little
visit
he
finished
holding
out
his
hand
and
again
burke
neither
then
nor
when
he
looked
straight
into
the
doctor
eyes
a
moment
later
could
find
aught
in
word
or
manner
upon
which
to
pin
his
watchful
suspicions
the
next
moment
the
doctor
was
gone
helen
yawned
luxuriously
openly
helen
never
troubled
to
hide
her
yawns
now
i
like
she
observed
emphatically
but
not
very
distinctly
owing
to
the
yawn
if
all
your
swell
friends
were
helen
for
heaven
sake
there
any
word
but
that
abominable
that
you
can
use
interrupted
her
husband
seizing
the
first
pretext
that
offered
itself
as
a
scapegoat
for
his
irritation
helen
laughed
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
all
right
up
then
if
you
like
that
better
but
for
my
part
i
like
best
it
so
expressive
so
much
more
swell
there
you
see
she
laughed
with
another
shrug
it
just
says
itself
but
really
i
do
like
the
doctor
i
think
he
just
grand
where
does
he
live
boston
burke
hated
grand
only
one
degree
less
than
swell
is
he
married
no
how
old
did
you
say
he
was
i
did
say
i
do
know
probably
why
burke
what
the
matter
what
are
you
so
short
about
do
you
it
that
i
like
him
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
like
your
friends
yes
yes
i
know
and
i
do
helen
of
course
burke
got
to
his
feet
and
took
a
nervous
turn
about
the
tiny
room
helen
watched
him
with
widening
eyes
the
look
of
indolent
satisfaction
was
gone
from
her
face
she
was
not
yawning
now
why
burke
what
the
matter
she
catechized
was
i
nice
to
him
did
i
talk
to
him
and
just
lay
myself
out
to
entertain
him
did
i
ask
him
to
dinner
and
dinner
burke
fairly
snarled
the
word
out
as
he
wheeled
sharply
holy
smoke
helen
i
wonder
if
you
think
i
have
that
man
come
here
to
dinner
or
come
here
ever
again
to
hear
you
oh
hang
it
all
what
am
i
saying
he
broke
off
jerking
himself
about
with
a
despairing
gesture
helen
came
now
to
her
feet
her
eyes
blazed
i
know
you
was
ashamed
of
me
she
panted
oh
come
come
nonsense
helen
you
was
of
course
i
was
then
what
was
the
matter
nothing
nothing
helen
there
was
too
do
you
suppose
i
know
but
i
tried
to
do
all
right
i
tried
to
make
you
of
me
she
choked
i
know
i
did
talk
much
at
first
i
was
scared
and
stupid
he
was
so
fine
and
grand
and
i
did
know
a
thing
about
all
that
egyptian
stuff
you
was
talking
about
then
i
thought
how
you
be
of
me
and
i
just
made
up
my
mind
i
talk
and
show
him
it
was
a
a
little
fool
that
you
married
and
i
i
was
doing
what
you
wanted
me
to
but
i
see
now
i
was
i
was
fine
enough
for
your
grand
friend
i
ai
never
fine
enough
for
but
i
do
care
i
hate
all
every
one
of
rather
have
jones
twice
over
is
ashamed
of
me
i
thought
i
was
you
and
now
now
her
words
were
lost
in
a
storm
of
sobs
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
done
of
course
and
burke
did
it
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
soothed
and
petted
and
praised
her
what
he
said
he
did
not
know
nor
care
for
that
matter
so
long
as
it
served
ever
so
slightly
to
dam
the
flood
of
helen
tears
that
for
the
moment
was
the
only
thing
worth
living
for
the
storm
passed
at
last
as
storms
must
but
it
was
still
a
teary
little
wife
that
received
her
kiss
some
time
later
burke
did
not
go
to
sleep
very
readily
that
night
in
his
mind
he
was
going
over
his
prospective
meeting
with
his
friend
gleason
the
next
day
what
would
gleason
say
how
would
he
act
what
would
he
himself
say
what
he
say
he
could
not
very
well
apologize
for
even
to
himself
burke
would
not
finish
the
sentence
apologize
indeed
no
as
if
there
were
anything
anyway
to
apologize
for
he
would
meet
gleason
exactly
as
usual
he
would
carry
his
head
high
there
should
be
about
him
no
air
of
apology
or
appeal
by
his
every
act
and
word
he
would
show
that
he
was
not
in
need
of
sympathy
and
that
he
should
resent
comment
he
might
even
ask
gleason
to
dinner
he
believed
he
ask
him
to
dinner
in
no
other
way
certainly
could
he
so
convincingly
show
how
er
proud
he
was
of
his
wife
burke
went
to
sleep
then
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
two
men
should
meet
at
noon
for
luncheon
and
promptly
on
time
burke
appeared
at
the
hotel
his
chin
was
indeed
high
and
for
the
first
two
minutes
he
was
painfully
guarded
and
in
his
bearing
but
under
the
unstudied
naturalness
of
the
doctor
manner
he
speedily
became
his
normal
self
and
in
five
minutes
the
two
were
conversing
with
their
old
ease
and
enthusiasm
the
doctor
had
with
him
an
egyptian
scarab
with
a
rarely
interesting
inscription
a
new
acquisition
also
a
tiny
babylonian
tablet
of
great
value
in
both
of
them
burke
was
much
interested
in
the
wake
then
of
a
stylus
it
is
not
strange
that
he
forgot
present
problems
i
taking
these
up
for
your
father
to
see
smiled
the
doctor
after
a
short
silence
he
writes
me
he
got
a
new
tablet
himself
a
very
old
one
he
thinks
he
made
a
discovery
on
it
too
he
swears
he
picked
out
a
veritable
on
one
side
nonsense
dad
always
discovering
things
grinned
burke
you
know
dad
but
he
says
this
is
a
sure
thing
it
visible
with
the
naked
eye
but
under
the
microscope
it
wonderful
and
but
never
mind
we
see
for
ourselves
you
coming
up
of
course
sure
and
i
want
to
see
the
young
man
stopped
abruptly
a
painful
color
had
swept
to
his
forehead
er
no
on
second
thoughts
i
i
he
corrected
in
its
resolute
emphasis
his
voice
sounded
almost
harsh
but
you
you
coming
to
dinner
with
us
night
are
you
oh
no
no
thank
you
began
the
doctor
hastily
then
suddenly
he
encountered
his
friend
steadfast
eye
upon
him
er
that
is
he
amended
in
his
turn
unless
you
you
are
willing
to
let
me
come
very
informally
as
i
shall
have
to
leave
almost
at
once
afterwards
taking
the
train
that
evening
very
good
we
shall
expect
you
answered
the
younger
man
with
a
curious
relaxation
of
voice
and
manner
a
relaxation
that
puzzled
and
slightly
worried
the
doctor
who
was
wondering
whether
it
were
the
relaxation
of
relief
or
despair
the
doctor
was
not
sure
yet
that
he
had
rightly
interpreted
that
steadfast
gaze
two
minutes
later
burke
once
again
constrained
and
with
his
head
high
took
his
leave
on
his
way
back
to
work
burke
berated
himself
soundly
having
deliberately
bound
himself
to
the
martyrdom
of
a
dinner
to
his
friend
he
was
now
insufferably
angry
that
he
should
regard
it
as
a
martyrdom
at
all
also
he
knew
within
himself
that
there
seemed
for
the
moment
nothing
that
he
would
not
give
to
spend
the
coming
evening
in
the
quiet
restfulness
of
his
father
library
with
the
doctor
and
an
egyptian
scarab
as
if
all
the
egyptian
scarabs
and
babylonian
tablets
in
the
world
balance
the
scale
with
helen
on
the
other
side
chapter
viii
diverging
ways
of
course
the
inevitable
happened
however
near
two
roads
may
be
at
the
start
if
they
diverge
ever
so
slightly
and
keep
straight
ahead
there
is
bound
to
be
in
time
all
the
world
between
them
in
the
case
of
burke
and
helen
their
roads
never
started
together
at
all
they
merely
crossed
and
at
the
crossing
came
the
wedding
they
were
miles
apart
at
the
start
miles
apart
in
tastes
traditions
and
environment
in
one
respect
only
were
they
alike
undisciplined
a
likeness
that
meant
only
added
differences
when
it
came
to
the
crossing
and
that
made
it
all
the
more
nearly
impossible
to
merge
those
two
diverging
roads
into
one
wide
way
leading
straight
on
to
wedded
happiness
all
his
life
burke
had
consulted
no
one
will
but
his
own
it
was
not
easy
now
to
walk
when
he
wanted
to
sit
still
nor
to
talk
when
he
wanted
to
read
especially
as
the
one
who
wanted
him
to
walk
and
to
talk
happened
to
be
a
willful
young
person
who
all
life
had
been
in
the
habit
of
walking
and
talking
when
wanted
to
burke
accustomed
from
babyhood
to
leaving
his
belongings
wherever
he
happened
to
drop
them
was
first
surprised
and
then
angry
that
he
did
not
find
them
magically
restored
to
their
proper
places
as
in
the
days
of
his
boyhood
and
youth
burke
abhorred
disorder
helen
accustomed
from
her
babyhood
to
being
after
easily
drifted
into
the
way
of
letting
all
things
both
hers
and
his
lie
as
they
were
it
saved
a
great
deal
of
work
even
so
simple
a
matter
as
the
temperature
of
a
had
its
difficulties
burke
liked
air
he
wanted
the
windows
wide
open
helen
trained
to
think
night
air
was
damp
and
dangerous
wanted
them
shut
and
when
two
people
are
sleepy
cross
and
tired
it
is
appalling
what
a
range
of
woe
can
lie
in
the
mere
opening
and
shutting
of
a
window
burke
was
surprised
annoyed
and
dismayed
being
unaccustomed
to
disappointments
he
did
not
know
how
to
take
them
gracefully
this
being
married
was
not
proving
to
be
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
he
had
pictured
to
himself
he
had
supposed
that
life
married
life
was
to
be
a
new
wonder
every
day
an
increasing
delight
every
hour
it
was
neither
living
now
was
a
matter
of
adjustment
and
economy
and
he
hated
them
all
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
getting
into
debt
and
he
hated
debt
it
made
a
fellow
feel
cheap
and
mean
even
helen
was
not
what
he
had
thought
she
was
he
was
ashamed
to
own
it
even
to
himself
but
there
was
a
good
deal
about
helen
that
he
did
not
like
she
was
not
careful
about
her
appearance
she
was
actually
almost
untidy
at
times
he
hated
those
loose
sloppy
things
she
sometimes
wore
and
he
abominated
those
things
in
her
hair
she
was
willful
and
fretful
and
she
certainly
did
not
know
how
to
give
a
fellow
a
decent
meal
or
a
comfortable
place
to
stay
for
his
part
he
did
not
think
a
girl
had
any
right
to
marry
until
she
knew
something
about
running
a
simple
home
then
there
was
her
constant
chatter
was
she
not
ever
going
to
talk
about
anything
but
the
silly
little
everyday
happenings
of
her
work
a
fellow
wanted
to
hear
something
when
he
came
home
tired
at
night
besides
complaints
that
the
range
did
work
or
that
the
grocer
forgot
his
order
or
that
the
money
was
out
why
helen
used
to
be
good
company
cheerful
often
witty
where
were
her
sparkle
and
radiance
her
talk
now
was
a
meaningless
chatter
of
trivial
things
or
an
irritating
wailing
complaint
of
everything
under
the
sun
chiefly
revolving
around
the
point
of
how
different
everything
was
from
what
she
expected
great
scott
as
if
had
not
found
some
things
different
evidently
was
what
marriage
was
different
but
talking
about
it
all
the
time
did
not
help
any
could
she
read
but
then
if
she
did
read
it
would
be
only
the
newspaper
account
of
the
latest
murder
and
then
she
would
want
to
talk
about
that
she
never
read
anything
worth
while
and
it
was
for
this
this
being
married
to
helen
that
he
had
given
up
so
much
dad
his
home
everything
she
did
appreciate
it
helen
did
she
did
not
rightly
estimate
what
he
was
being
made
to
suffer
that
there
was
any
especial
meaning
in
all
this
that
he
himself
should
take
to
heart
that
there
was
any
course
open
to
him
but
righteous
discontent
and
rebellion
never
occurred
to
burke
his
training
of
frosted
cakes
and
toy
shotguns
had
taught
him
nothing
of
the
traditional
two
bears
bear
and
forbear
the
marriage
ceremony
had
not
meant
to
him
to
be
patient
tender
and
sympathetic
it
had
meant
the
i
will
of
not
the
i
will
of
that
helen
ought
to
change
many
of
traits
and
habits
he
was
convinced
that
there
might
be
some
in
himself
that
needed
changing
or
that
the
mere
fact
of
his
having
married
helen
might
have
entailed
upon
himself
certain
obligations
as
to
making
the
best
of
what
he
had
deliberately
chosen
did
not
once
occur
to
him
as
for
helen
helen
was
facing
her
own
disillusions
she
was
not
trying
now
to
be
the
daintily
gowned
wife
welcoming
her
husband
to
a
home
she
had
long
since
decided
that
that
was
impossible
on
sixty
dollars
a
month
she
was
tired
of
being
a
martyr
wife
even
the
laurel
wreath
of
praise
had
lost
its
allurement
she
would
not
get
it
probably
even
if
she
earned
it
and
anyway
she
would
be
dead
from
trying
to
get
it
and
for
her
part
she
would
rather
have
some
fun
while
she
was
living
but
she
was
having
any
fun
things
were
so
different
everything
was
different
she
had
not
supposed
being
married
was
like
this
one
long
grind
of
housework
from
morning
till
night
and
for
a
man
who
did
not
care
and
burke
did
not
care
now
once
the
first
thing
he
wanted
when
he
came
into
the
house
was
a
kiss
and
a
word
from
her
now
he
wanted
his
dinner
and
he
was
so
fussy
too
could
get
along
with
cold
things
but
he
wanted
hot
ones
and
lots
of
them
and
he
always
wanted
and
lots
of
spoons
and
everything
fixed
just
so
on
the
table
too
he
said
it
was
that
he
wanted
style
it
was
just
that
he
wanted
things
decent
as
if
she
had
had
things
decent
herself
and
without
all
that
fuss
and
clutter
after
dinner
he
never
wanted
to
talk
now
or
to
go
to
walk
he
just
wanted
to
read
or
study
he
said
he
was
studying
something
about
his
work
as
if
once
he
would
have
cared
more
for
any
old
work
than
for
her
and
she
was
so
lonely
there
was
nobody
now
for
her
to
be
with
jones
had
moved
away
and
there
were
never
any
callers
now
she
had
returned
every
one
of
the
calls
she
had
had
from
burke
fine
friends
she
had
put
on
her
new
red
dress
and
her
best
hat
with
the
pink
roses
and
she
had
tried
to
be
just
as
bright
and
entertaining
as
she
knew
how
to
be
but
they
never
came
again
so
of
course
she
could
not
go
to
see
them
she
gone
once
or
twice
but
burke
said
she
must
not
do
that
it
was
not
proper
to
return
your
own
calls
if
they
wanted
to
see
her
they
would
come
themselves
but
they
never
came
probably
anyhow
they
did
not
want
to
see
her
and
that
was
the
trouble
not
that
she
cared
they
were
a
lot
anyway
and
she
was
just
as
good
as
they
were
she
had
told
one
woman
so
once
the
woman
that
carried
her
eyeglasses
on
the
end
of
a
little
stick
and
stared
that
woman
always
had
made
her
mad
so
it
was
just
as
well
perhaps
that
they
did
not
come
any
more
after
all
burke
was
ashamed
of
her
anyway
when
they
did
come
she
knew
that
he
did
not
like
anything
she
did
nowadays
he
was
always
telling
her
he
did
wish
she
would
stop
saying
you
was
or
holding
her
fork
like
that
or
making
so
much
noise
eating
soup
and
a
dozen
other
things
as
if
nobody
in
the
house
had
a
right
to
do
anything
but
way
it
had
been
so
different
at
home
there
everything
she
did
was
just
right
and
she
was
never
lonely
there
were
the
parties
and
the
frolics
and
the
and
the
girls
running
in
all
the
time
and
the
boys
every
evening
on
the
porch
or
in
the
parlor
or
taking
her
nothing
there
was
ever
complete
without
her
while
here
well
who
supposed
being
married
meant
working
like
a
slave
all
day
and
being
cooped
up
all
the
evening
with
a
man
whose
nose
was
buried
in
a
book
and
who
scarcely
spoke
to
you
and
there
was
the
money
burke
acted
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
thought
she
ate
money
and
ate
it
whether
she
was
hungry
or
not
just
to
spite
him
as
if
she
did
squeeze
every
penny
till
it
fairly
shrieked
now
and
as
if
anybody
could
make
ten
dollars
a
week
go
further
than
she
did
to
be
sure
at
first
she
had
been
silly
and
extravagant
running
up
bills
and
borrowing
of
jones
as
she
did
and
of
course
she
was
a
little
unreasonable
and
childish
about
keeping
that
but
that
was
only
at
the
first
when
she
was
quite
ignorant
and
inexperienced
it
was
very
different
now
she
kept
a
cash
account
and
most
of
the
time
it
came
right
how
she
wished
she
had
an
allowance
though
but
burke
utterly
refused
to
give
her
that
said
she
be
extravagant
and
spend
it
all
the
first
day
as
if
she
had
not
learned
better
than
that
by
bitter
experience
and
as
if
anything
could
be
worse
than
the
way
they
were
trying
to
get
along
now
with
her
teasing
for
money
all
the
time
and
him
insisting
on
seeing
the
bills
and
then
asking
how
they
manage
to
eat
so
many
eggs
and
saying
he
should
think
she
used
butter
to
oil
the
floors
with
he
did
see
how
it
could
go
so
fast
any
other
way
and
was
he
always
telling
her
she
did
not
manage
right
and
did
he
give
her
particular
fits
one
day
and
an
awful
lecture
on
wastefulness
just
because
he
happened
to
find
half
a
loaf
of
mouldy
bread
in
the
jar
just
as
if
did
spend
something
and
a
good
big
something
too
on
all
those
cigars
he
smoked
yet
he
flew
into
fits
over
a
bit
of
mouldy
bread
of
to
be
sure
when
she
cried
he
called
himself
a
brute
and
said
he
did
mean
it
and
it
was
only
because
he
hated
so
to
have
her
pinching
and
saving
all
the
time
that
it
made
him
mad
raving
mad
just
as
if
she
was
to
blame
that
they
did
not
have
any
money
but
she
was
to
blame
of
course
in
a
way
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
he
would
be
living
at
home
with
all
the
money
he
wanted
sometimes
it
came
to
her
with
sickening
force
that
maybe
burke
was
thinking
that
too
was
he
could
it
be
that
he
was
sorry
he
had
married
her
very
well
her
chin
came
up
proudly
he
need
not
stay
if
he
did
not
want
to
he
could
go
but
the
chin
was
not
so
high
now
he
was
all
there
was
she
had
nobody
but
burke
now
it
be
she
believed
she
would
ask
gleason
some
time
she
liked
the
doctor
he
had
been
there
several
times
now
and
she
felt
real
well
acquainted
with
him
perhaps
he
would
know
but
after
all
she
was
not
going
to
worry
she
did
not
believe
that
really
burke
wished
he
had
not
married
her
it
was
only
that
he
was
tired
and
fretted
with
his
work
it
would
be
better
by
and
by
when
he
had
got
ahead
a
little
and
of
course
he
would
get
ahead
they
would
not
always
have
to
live
like
this
it
was
in
march
that
burke
came
home
to
dinner
one
evening
with
a
radiant
face
yet
with
an
air
of
worried
excitement
it
dad
he
sent
for
me
he
explained
in
answer
to
his
questions
sent
for
you
yes
he
is
very
well
brett
says
he
wants
to
see
me
humph
after
all
this
time
i
would
go
a
step
if
i
was
you
helen
not
go
to
my
father
helen
quaked
a
little
under
the
fire
in
her
husband
eyes
but
she
held
her
ground
i
do
care
he
treated
you
like
dirt
you
know
he
has
i
know
he
sick
and
has
sent
for
me
and
i
know
i
going
to
him
that
enough
for
me
to
know
at
present
retorted
the
man
getting
to
his
feet
and
leaving
his
dinner
almost
untasted
half
an
hour
later
he
appeared
before
her
freshly
shaved
and
in
the
radiant
good
humor
that
seems
to
follow
a
bath
and
fresh
garments
as
a
natural
consequence
come
chicken
give
us
a
kiss
he
cried
gayly
and
do
sit
up
for
me
i
may
be
late
my
but
ai
we
fixed
up
pouted
helen
jealously
i
should
think
you
was
going
to
see
your
best
girl
i
am
laughed
burke
boyishly
dad
was
my
best
girl
till
i
got
you
i
off
helen
lips
still
pouted
and
her
eyes
burned
somberly
as
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
outside
the
house
burke
drew
a
long
breath
and
yet
a
longer
one
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
inhale
deeply
enough
the
crisp
bracing
air
then
with
an
eager
stride
that
would
cover
the
distance
in
little
more
than
half
the
usual
time
he
set
off
toward
elm
hill
there
was
only
joyous
anticipation
in
his
face
now
the
worry
was
all
gone
after
all
had
not
brett
said
that
this
illness
of
dad
was
nothing
serious
for
a
week
burke
had
known
that
something
was
wrong
that
his
father
was
not
at
the
works
in
vain
had
he
haunted
office
doors
and
corridors
for
a
glimpse
of
a
face
that
never
appeared
then
had
come
the
news
that
john
denby
was
a
paralyzing
fear
clutched
the
son
heart
was
this
to
be
the
end
then
was
dad
to
die
and
never
to
know
never
to
read
his
boy
heart
was
this
the
end
of
all
hopes
of
some
day
seeing
the
old
look
of
love
and
pride
in
his
father
eyes
then
it
would
indeed
be
the
end
of
everything
if
dad
died
for
what
was
the
use
of
struggling
of
straining
every
nerve
to
make
good
if
dad
was
not
to
be
there
to
know
it
had
been
at
this
point
that
burke
in
spite
of
his
hurt
pride
and
of
his
very
lively
doubts
as
to
the
cordiality
of
his
reception
had
almost
determined
to
go
himself
to
the
old
home
and
demand
to
see
his
father
then
just
in
time
had
come
brett
wonderful
message
that
his
father
wished
to
see
him
and
that
he
was
not
after
all
fatally
or
even
seriously
dad
was
not
going
to
die
then
and
dad
wished
to
see
him
to
see
him
burke
drew
in
his
breath
now
again
and
bounded
up
the
great
stone
steps
of
denby
mansion
two
at
a
time
the
next
minute
for
the
first
time
since
his
marriage
the
summer
before
he
stood
in
the
wide
familiar
hallway
benton
the
old
butler
took
his
hat
and
coat
and
the
way
he
took
them
had
in
it
all
the
flattering
deference
of
the
servant
and
the
rapturous
joy
of
the
head
of
a
house
welcoming
a
dear
wanderer
home
burke
looked
into
the
beaming
old
face
and
shining
eyes
and
swallowed
hard
before
he
could
utter
an
unsteady
how
are
you
benton
i
very
well
sir
thank
you
sir
and
it
glad
i
am
to
see
you
master
burke
this
way
please
the
master
in
the
library
sir
unconsciously
burke
denby
lifted
his
chin
a
something
seemed
to
have
come
back
to
him
he
could
not
himself
have
defined
it
and
he
certainly
could
not
have
told
why
at
that
moment
he
should
suddenly
have
thought
of
the
supercilious
face
of
his
hated
boss
at
the
works
behind
benton
noiseless
steps
burke
feet
sank
into
luxurious
velvet
depths
his
eyes
swept
from
one
dear
familiar
object
to
another
in
the
great
softly
lighted
hall
and
leaped
ahead
to
the
open
door
of
the
library
then
somehow
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
his
father
in
the
dear
room
well
burke
my
boy
how
are
you
they
were
the
same
words
that
had
been
spoken
months
before
in
the
president
office
at
the
denby
iron
works
and
they
were
spoken
by
the
same
voice
they
were
spoken
to
the
accompaniment
of
an
outstretched
hand
too
in
each
case
but
to
burke
who
had
heard
them
on
both
occasions
they
were
as
different
as
darkness
and
daylight
he
could
not
have
defined
it
even
to
himself
but
he
knew
the
minute
he
grasped
the
outstretched
hand
and
looked
into
his
father
eyes
that
the
hated
impenetrable
insurmountable
wall
was
gone
yet
there
was
nothing
said
nothing
done
except
a
conventional
just
a
little
matter
of
business
burke
that
i
wanted
to
talk
over
with
you
from
the
elder
man
and
an
equally
conventional
yes
sir
from
his
son
then
the
two
sat
down
but
for
burke
the
whole
world
had
burst
suddenly
into
song
it
was
indeed
a
simple
matter
of
business
it
was
not
even
an
important
one
ordinarily
it
would
have
been
brett
place
or
even
one
of
his
assistants
to
speak
of
it
but
the
president
of
the
denby
iron
works
took
it
up
point
by
point
and
dwelt
lovingly
on
each
detail
and
burke
his
heart
one
wild
pæan
of
rejoicing
sat
with
a
grave
countenance
listening
attentively
and
when
there
was
left
not
one
small
detail
upon
which
to
pin
another
word
and
when
burke
was
beginning
to
dread
the
moment
of
dismissal
john
denby
turned
as
if
casually
to
a
small
clay
tablet
on
the
desk
near
him
and
burke
following
his
father
into
a
past
to
decipher
a
babylonian
lost
all
fear
of
that
dread
dismissal
later
came
old
benton
with
the
ale
and
the
little
cakes
that
burke
had
always
loved
with
a
pressure
of
his
thumb
then
john
denby
switched
off
half
the
lights
and
the
two
father
and
son
sat
down
before
the
big
fireplace
with
the
cakes
and
ale
between
them
on
a
low
stand
behind
the
andirons
the
fire
leaped
and
crackled
throwing
weird
shadows
over
the
beamed
ceiling
the
walls
the
cabinets
of
curios
bringing
out
here
and
there
a
bit
of
gold
tooling
behind
a
glass
door
or
a
glinting
flash
from
bronze
or
porcelain
with
a
body
at
ease
and
a
mind
at
rest
burke
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
sigh
each
tingling
sense
ecstatically
responsive
to
every
charm
of
light
and
shade
and
luxury
half
an
hour
later
he
rose
to
go
john
denby
too
rose
to
his
feet
you
come
again
of
course
the
father
said
as
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
first
time
that
evening
there
was
a
faint
touch
of
constraint
in
his
manner
suppose
you
come
to
dinner
sunday
will
you
surely
i
will
and
be
glad
with
a
swift
surge
of
embarrassed
color
burke
denby
stopped
short
in
one
shamed
shocked
instant
it
had
come
to
him
that
he
had
forgotten
helen
her
not
for
a
long
hour
had
he
even
remembered
that
there
was
such
a
person
in
existence
er
ah
that
is
he
began
again
stammeringly
an
odd
expression
crossed
john
denby
countenance
you
will
of
course
bring
your
wife
he
said
burke
mumbled
an
incoherent
something
and
fled
the
next
moment
he
found
himself
in
the
hall
with
benton
deferential
and
solicitous
holding
his
coat
again
out
in
the
crisp
night
air
burke
drew
a
long
breath
was
it
true
had
dad
invited
him
to
dinner
next
sunday
with
helen
what
had
happened
had
dad
heart
got
the
better
of
his
pride
had
he
decided
that
quarreling
did
not
pay
did
this
mean
the
beginning
of
the
end
was
he
ready
to
take
his
son
back
into
his
heart
he
had
not
said
anything
he
had
just
talked
in
the
usual
way
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
that
would
be
like
dad
dad
hated
scenes
dad
would
never
say
i
sorry
i
was
so
harsh
with
you
come
back
you
and
helen
i
want
you
and
then
fall
to
crying
and
kissing
like
a
woman
dad
would
never
do
that
it
would
be
like
dad
just
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
the
old
comradeship
exactly
where
he
had
dropped
it
months
ago
and
that
was
what
he
had
seemed
to
be
doing
that
evening
he
had
talked
just
as
he
used
to
talk
except
that
never
once
had
he
mentioned
mother
burke
remembered
this
now
and
wondered
at
it
it
was
so
unusual
in
dad
had
he
done
it
purposely
was
there
a
hidden
meaning
back
of
it
he
himself
had
not
liked
to
think
of
mother
lately
yet
somehow
she
seemed
always
to
be
in
his
mind
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
always
wondering
what
she
would
think
of
helen
but
surely
dad
with
his
thoughts
in
a
dizzy
whirl
of
excitement
and
questionings
burke
thrust
his
key
into
the
lock
and
let
himself
into
his
own
apartment
the
hall
never
had
it
looked
so
hopelessly
cheap
and
small
burke
still
under
the
spell
of
benton
solicitous
ministrations
jerked
off
his
hat
and
coat
and
hung
them
up
then
he
strode
into
the
helen
fully
dressed
was
sitting
at
the
table
reading
a
magazine
hullo
sitting
up
are
you
chicken
he
greeted
her
brushing
her
cheek
with
his
lips
i
told
you
not
to
but
maybe
it
just
as
well
you
did
i
might
have
waked
you
he
laughed
boyishly
guess
happened
got
a
raise
helen
voice
was
eager
her
husband
frowned
no
i
got
one
last
month
you
know
i
getting
a
hundred
now
what
more
can
you
expect
in
my
position
he
spoke
coldly
with
a
tinge
of
sharpness
he
was
wondering
why
helen
always
managed
to
take
the
zest
out
of
anything
he
was
going
to
do
or
say
then
with
an
obvious
effort
at
gayety
he
went
on
it
better
than
a
raise
chicken
invited
us
to
dinner
next
sunday
both
of
us
to
dinner
only
to
dinner
to
dinner
great
cæsar
helen
to
dinner
well
i
ca
help
it
burke
it
just
makes
me
mad
to
see
you
jump
and
run
and
be
so
pleased
over
just
a
dinner
when
it
ought
to
be
for
every
dinner
and
all
the
time
and
you
know
it
but
helen
it
is
the
it
that
that
dad
the
man
voice
softened
and
became
not
quite
steady
that
maybe
forgiven
me
that
he
going
to
be
now
the
the
old
dad
that
i
used
to
know
oh
helen
i
him
so
i
but
his
wife
interrupted
tartly
well
i
should
think
was
time
he
did
forgive
you
and
i
not
saying
i
think
there
was
anything
to
forgive
either
there
would
have
been
if
he
had
tried
to
interfere
with
what
was
our
own
business
yours
and
mine
there
was
a
brief
silence
burke
looking
very
white
and
stern
had
got
to
his
feet
and
was
moving
restlessly
about
the
room
did
you
think
he
was
giving
in
asked
helen
at
last
he
was
very
kind
what
did
you
tell
him
what
do
you
mean
about
the
dinner
sunday
i
do
know
exactly
i
said
something
yes
i
think
i
meant
it
for
yes
then
the
man
spoke
with
sudden
utter
weariness
there
was
another
brief
silence
a
dawning
shrewdness
was
coming
into
helen
eyes
oh
of
course
yes
we
want
to
go
she
murmured
it
mean
he
was
giving
in
could
it
there
was
no
reply
do
you
think
he
giving
in
still
no
reply
helen
scowled
burke
why
in
the
world
do
you
answer
me
she
demanded
crossly
you
were
talkative
enough
a
minute
ago
when
you
came
in
i
should
think
you
might
have
enough
thought
of
interests
to
want
us
to
go
to
live
with
your
father
if
there
any
chance
of
it
and
while
be
way
to
jump
the
minute
he
held
out
his
hand
yet
if
this
dinner
really
means
that
we
be
going
up
there
to
live
pretty
soon
why
helen
burke
had
winced
visibly
as
if
from
a
blow
you
see
anything
or
talk
anything
but
our
going
up
there
to
live
it
enough
for
me
that
dad
just
looked
at
me
with
the
old
look
in
his
eyes
that
somehow
he
smashed
that
confounded
wall
between
us
that
but
what
the
use
never
mind
the
dinner
we
wo
go
nonsense
burke
do
be
silly
of
course
we
going
i
miss
it
for
the
world
under
the
circumstances
and
helen
with
an
air
of
finality
rose
to
her
feet
to
prepare
for
bed
her
husband
looking
after
her
with
eyes
that
were
half
resigned
half
rebellious
for
the
second
time
that
evening
gave
a
sigh
of
utter
weariness
and
turned
away
they
went
to
the
dinner
helen
became
really
very
interested
and
enthusiastic
in
her
preparations
for
it
and
even
burke
after
a
time
seemed
to
regain
a
little
of
his
old
eagerness
they
had
to
be
sure
nearly
a
quarrel
over
the
dress
and
hat
that
helen
wished
to
wear
but
after
some
argument
and
not
a
few
tears
she
yielded
to
her
none
too
gently
expressed
abhorrence
of
the
hat
in
question
which
was
a
new
one
and
of
the
dress
one
he
had
always
disliked
but
i
wanted
to
make
a
good
impression
pouted
helen
exactly
so
do
i
want
you
to
returned
her
husband
significantly
and
there
the
matter
ended
it
was
not
a
success
that
dinner
helen
intent
on
making
her
good
impression
very
plainly
tried
to
be
admiring
entertaining
and
solicitous
of
her
host
welfare
and
happiness
she
resulted
in
being
nauseatingly
flattering
pert
and
inquisitive
john
denby
at
first
very
evidently
determined
to
give
no
just
cause
for
criticism
of
his
own
behavior
was
the
perfection
of
courtesy
and
cordiality
even
when
later
he
was
unable
quite
to
hide
his
annoyance
at
the
persistent
and
assiduous
attentions
and
questions
of
his
he
was
yet
courteous
though
in
unmistakable
retreat
burke
denby
poor
burke
with
every
sense
and
sensitiveness
keyed
to
instant
response
to
each
tone
and
word
and
gesture
of
the
two
before
him
each
passing
minute
was
to
burke
but
a
greater
torture
than
the
one
preceding
it
long
before
dinner
was
over
he
wished
himself
and
helen
at
home
and
as
soon
as
was
decently
possible
after
the
meal
he
peremptorily
suggested
departure
i
could
stand
it
i
could
stand
it
another
minute
he
told
himself
passionately
as
he
hurried
helen
down
the
long
walk
leading
to
the
street
but
dad
dad
was
a
brick
and
he
asked
us
to
come
again
good
heavens
as
if
i
go
through
that
again
it
was
so
much
worse
than
at
home
but
i
glad
he
did
put
her
in
mother
chair
i
do
think
even
i
could
have
stood
that
well
that
over
murmured
helen
complacently
as
they
turned
into
the
public
sidewalk
and
well
over
still
i
did
enjoy
myself
so
very
much
and
i
do
believe
you
did
either
she
laughed
else
you
would
have
been
in
such
a
taking
to
get
away
there
was
no
answer
helen
however
evidently
sure
of
her
ground
did
not
seem
to
notice
she
yawned
pleasantly
guess
i
sleepy
ate
too
much
a
good
dinner
and
just
as
i
told
your
father
things
always
taste
especially
good
when
you
get
much
at
home
i
said
it
on
purpose
i
thought
maybe
make
him
think
still
silence
helen
turned
sharply
and
peered
into
her
husband
face
what
the
matter
she
demanded
suspiciously
why
are
you
so
glum
burke
instantly
alert
to
the
danger
of
having
another
scene
such
as
had
followed
gleason
first
visit
desperately
ran
to
cover
nothing
nothing
he
essayed
a
gay
smile
and
succeeded
i
stupid
that
all
maybe
i
sleepy
myself
it
ca
be
you
put
out
we
came
away
so
early
you
suggested
it
yourself
her
eyes
were
still
suspiciously
bent
upon
him
not
a
bit
of
it
i
wanted
to
come
she
relaxed
and
took
her
gaze
off
his
face
the
unmistakable
sincerity
in
his
voice
this
last
time
had
carried
conviction
i
thought
you
did
she
murmured
contentedly
again
still
i
was
kind
of
scared
when
you
proposed
it
i
did
suppose
was
proper
to
eat
and
run
mother
always
said
so
do
you
think
he
minded
it
your
father
not
a
bit
burke
in
his
thankfulness
to
have
escaped
the
threatened
scene
was
enabled
to
speak
lightly
almost
gayly
well
i
glad
i
would
have
wanted
him
to
mind
i
to
be
nice
to
him
did
i
you
did
certainly
burke
lips
came
together
a
little
grimly
but
helen
eyes
were
turned
away
and
after
a
moment
pause
she
changed
the
subject
to
her
husband
infinite
relief
chapter
ix
a
bottle
of
ink
burke
denby
did
not
attempt
to
deceive
himself
after
that
sunday
dinner
his
marriage
had
been
a
mistake
and
he
knew
it
he
was
disappointed
ashamed
and
angry
he
told
himself
that
he
was
heartbroken
that
he
still
loved
helen
dearly
only
he
did
not
like
to
be
with
her
now
she
made
him
nervous
and
rubbed
him
the
wrong
way
her
mood
never
seemed
to
fit
in
with
his
she
had
so
many
little
ways
sometimes
he
told
himself
irritably
that
he
believed
that
if
it
were
a
big
thing
like
a
crime
that
helen
had
committed
he
could
be
heroic
and
forgiving
and
glory
in
it
but
forever
to
battle
against
a
succession
of
irritations
always
to
encounter
the
friction
of
antagonistic
aims
and
ideals
it
was
maddening
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
of
course
he
was
ashamed
of
lots
of
things
that
he
said
and
did
but
he
could
not
help
an
explosion
now
and
then
he
felt
as
if
somewhere
within
him
was
an
irresistible
force
driving
him
to
it
and
the
pity
of
it
was
he
not
indeed
to
be
pitied
what
had
he
not
given
up
as
if
it
were
his
fault
that
he
was
now
so
disillusioned
he
had
supposed
that
marriage
with
helen
would
be
a
fresh
joy
every
morning
a
new
delight
every
evening
an
unbelievable
glory
of
happiness
just
being
together
now
he
did
not
want
to
be
together
he
did
not
want
to
go
home
to
fretfulness
slovenliness
and
perpetual
criticism
he
wanted
to
go
home
to
peace
and
harmony
big
quiet
rooms
servants
that
knew
their
business
and
dad
and
that
was
another
thing
dad
dad
had
been
right
he
himself
had
been
wrong
but
that
did
not
mean
that
it
was
easy
to
own
up
that
he
had
been
wrong
sometimes
he
hardly
knew
which
cut
the
deeper
that
he
had
been
proved
wrong
thus
losing
his
happiness
or
that
his
father
had
been
proved
right
thus
placing
him
in
a
position
to
hear
the
hated
i
told
you
so
that
helen
could
never
make
him
happy
burke
was
convinced
now
never
had
he
realized
this
so
fully
as
since
seeing
her
at
his
father
table
that
sunday
never
had
her
ways
so
irritated
him
never
had
he
so
poignantly
realized
the
significance
of
what
he
had
lost
and
won
never
had
he
been
so
ashamed
or
so
ashamed
because
he
was
ashamed
as
on
that
day
never
he
vowed
would
he
be
placed
in
the
same
position
again
as
to
helen
side
of
the
matter
burke
quite
forgot
that
there
was
such
a
thing
when
one
is
so
very
sorry
for
one
self
one
forgets
to
be
sorry
for
anybody
else
and
burke
was
indeed
very
sorry
for
himself
having
never
been
in
the
habit
of
taking
disagreeable
medicine
he
did
not
know
how
to
take
it
now
having
been
always
accustomed
to
consider
only
himself
he
considered
only
himself
now
that
helen
too
might
be
disappointed
and
disillusioned
never
occurred
to
him
it
was
perhaps
a
month
later
that
another
invitation
to
dinner
came
from
john
denby
this
time
burke
did
not
stutter
out
a
joyous
incoherent
acceptance
he
declined
so
promptly
and
emphatically
that
he
quite
forgot
his
manners
for
the
moment
and
had
to
attach
to
the
end
of
his
refusal
a
hurried
and
ineffectual
er
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
sure
he
looked
up
then
and
met
his
father
eyes
but
instantly
his
gaze
dropped
er
ah
helen
is
not
well
at
all
dad
he
still
further
added
nervously
of
course
i
speak
to
her
but
i
do
think
we
can
come
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
very
gravely
john
denby
said
oh
i
am
sorry
son
burke
with
a
sudden
tightening
of
his
throat
turned
and
walked
away
he
did
laugh
he
did
sneer
he
did
look
only
just
plain
sorry
choked
the
young
man
to
himself
and
he
had
such
a
magnificent
chance
to
do
all
of
them
but
he
just
understood
burke
spoke
to
helen
that
night
father
asked
us
to
dinner
next
sunday
but
i
said
i
did
think
we
could
go
i
told
him
you
were
feeling
well
i
did
think
you
want
to
go
and
i
did
want
to
go
myself
helen
frowned
and
pouted
well
i
got
my
opinion
of
folks
who
refuse
an
invitation
without
even
asking
if
they
want
to
go
she
bridled
not
that
i
mind
much
in
this
case
though
if
it
just
a
dinner
i
thought
once
maybe
he
meant
something
that
he
was
giving
in
you
know
but
i
have
seen
any
signs
of
and
as
for
just
going
to
dinner
i
ca
say
i
am
anxious
for
that
mean
as
i
feel
now
no
i
thought
not
said
burke
and
there
the
matter
ended
as
the
summer
passed
burke
fell
into
the
way
of
going
often
to
see
his
father
though
never
at
he
went
alone
helen
said
she
did
not
care
to
go
and
that
she
did
not
what
fun
burke
could
find
in
it
anyway
to
burke
these
hours
that
he
spent
with
his
father
chatting
and
smoking
in
the
dim
old
library
or
on
the
veranda
were
like
a
breeze
blowing
across
the
desert
of
existence
like
water
in
a
thirsty
land
from
day
to
day
he
planned
for
these
visits
from
hour
to
hour
he
lived
upon
them
to
all
appearances
john
denby
and
his
son
had
picked
up
their
old
comradeship
exactly
where
the
marriage
had
severed
it
even
to
watchful
sensitive
eyes
the
wall
seemed
quite
gone
there
was
however
one
difference
mother
was
never
mentioned
john
denby
never
spoke
of
her
now
there
was
plenty
to
talk
about
there
were
all
the
old
interests
and
there
was
business
burke
was
giving
himself
heart
and
soul
to
business
these
days
in
july
he
won
another
promotion
and
was
given
an
advance
in
wages
often
to
burke
infinite
joy
his
father
consulted
him
about
matters
and
things
quite
beyond
his
normal
position
and
showed
in
other
ways
his
approval
of
his
son
progress
helen
the
marriage
and
the
dale
street
home
life
were
never
mentioned
for
which
burke
was
thankful
he
say
anything
i
want
to
hear
said
burke
to
himself
at
times
and
i
ca
say
anything
wants
to
hear
best
forget
it
if
we
can
to
forget
it
seemed
indeed
in
these
days
to
be
burke
aim
and
effort
always
had
burke
tried
to
forget
things
from
the
day
his
fingers
had
flung
the
offending
rattle
behind
him
had
burke
endeavored
to
thrust
out
of
sight
and
mind
everything
that
annoyed
and
helen
and
marriage
had
become
very
annoying
systematically
therefore
he
was
trying
to
forget
them
his
attitude
indeed
was
not
unlike
that
of
a
small
boy
who
weary
of
his
game
of
marbles
cries
oh
come
let
play
something
else
i
tired
of
this
an
attitude
which
naturally
was
not
conducive
to
happiness
either
for
himself
or
for
any
one
else
particularly
as
the
game
he
was
playing
was
marriage
not
marbles
the
summer
passed
and
october
came
life
at
the
dale
street
flat
had
settled
into
a
monotony
of
discontent
and
dreariness
helen
discouraged
disappointed
and
far
from
well
dragged
through
the
housework
day
by
day
wishing
each
night
that
it
were
morning
and
each
morning
that
it
were
night
a
state
of
mind
scarcely
conducive
to
happiness
on
her
part
for
all
that
burke
was
away
so
many
evenings
now
helen
was
not
so
lonely
as
she
had
been
in
the
spring
for
in
jones
place
had
come
a
new
neighbor
cobb
and
cobb
was
even
brighter
and
more
original
than
jones
ever
was
and
helen
liked
her
very
much
she
was
a
mine
of
information
as
to
housekeeping
secrets
and
she
was
teaching
helen
how
to
make
the
soft
and
dainty
little
garments
that
would
be
needed
in
november
but
she
talked
even
more
loudly
than
jones
had
talked
and
her
laugh
was
nearly
always
the
first
sound
that
burke
heard
across
the
hall
every
morning
moreover
she
possessed
a
phonograph
which
according
to
helen
played
perfectly
grand
tunes
and
some
one
of
these
tunes
was
usually
the
first
thing
that
burke
heard
every
night
when
he
came
home
so
he
called
her
coarse
and
noisy
and
declared
she
was
even
worse
than
jones
whereat
helen
retorted
that
of
course
he
like
her
if
did
which
while
possibly
true
did
not
make
him
like
either
her
or
cobb
any
better
the
baby
came
in
november
it
was
a
little
girl
helen
wanted
to
call
her
vivian
mabelle
she
said
she
thought
that
was
a
swell
name
and
that
it
was
the
name
of
her
favorite
heroine
in
a
perfectly
grand
book
but
burke
objected
strenuously
he
declared
very
emphatically
that
no
daughter
of
his
should
have
to
go
through
life
tagged
like
a
vaudeville
of
course
helen
cried
and
of
course
burke
felt
ashamed
of
himself
helen
tears
had
always
been
a
potent
weapon
though
from
they
were
fast
losing
a
measure
of
their
power
the
first
time
he
saw
her
cry
the
foundations
of
the
earth
sank
beneath
him
and
he
dropped
into
a
fathomless
abyss
from
which
he
thought
he
would
never
rise
it
was
the
same
the
next
time
and
the
next
the
fourth
time
as
he
felt
the
now
familiar
sensation
of
sinking
down
down
down
he
outflung
desperate
hands
and
found
an
unexpected
support
his
temper
after
that
it
was
always
with
him
it
helped
to
tinge
with
righteous
indignation
his
despair
and
it
kept
him
from
utterly
melting
into
weak
subserviency
still
even
yet
he
was
not
used
to
them
his
tears
sometimes
he
fled
from
them
sometimes
he
endured
them
in
dumb
despair
behind
set
teeth
sometimes
he
raved
and
ranted
in
a
way
he
was
always
ashamed
of
afterwards
but
still
they
had
the
power
in
a
measure
to
make
his
heart
like
water
within
him
so
now
about
the
baby
name
he
called
himself
a
brute
and
a
beast
to
bring
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
little
mother
toward
whom
since
the
baby
advent
he
felt
a
remorseful
tenderness
but
he
still
maintained
that
he
could
have
no
man
or
woman
call
his
daughter
vivian
mabelle
but
i
should
think
you
let
me
name
my
own
baby
wailed
his
wife
burke
choked
back
a
hasty
word
and
assumed
his
pet
air
and
you
shall
name
it
he
soothed
her
listen
here
are
pencil
and
paper
now
write
down
a
whole
lot
of
names
that
you
like
and
promise
to
select
one
of
them
then
you
be
naming
the
baby
all
right
see
helen
did
not
see
quite
that
she
would
be
naming
the
baby
but
knowing
from
past
experience
of
her
husband
temper
that
resistance
would
be
unpleasant
she
obediently
took
the
paper
and
spent
some
time
writing
down
a
list
of
names
burke
frowned
a
good
deal
when
he
saw
the
list
and
declared
that
it
was
pretty
poor
pickings
and
that
he
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
have
bound
himself
to
a
promise
like
that
but
he
chose
a
name
he
said
he
would
keep
his
word
of
course
and
he
selected
dorothy
elizabeth
as
being
less
impossible
than
its
accompanying
veras
violets
and
clarissa
muriels
for
the
first
few
months
after
the
baby
advent
burke
spent
much
more
time
at
home
and
seemed
very
evidently
to
be
trying
to
pay
especial
attention
to
his
wife
comfort
and
welfare
he
was
proud
of
the
baby
and
declared
it
was
the
cutest
little
kid
going
he
poked
it
in
its
ribs
thrust
a
tentative
finger
into
the
of
a
hand
emitting
a
triumphant
chuckle
of
delight
when
the
became
a
tightly
clutching
little
fist
and
even
allowed
the
baby
to
be
placed
one
or
twice
in
his
rather
reluctant
and
fearful
arms
but
for
the
most
part
he
contented
himself
with
merely
looking
at
it
and
asking
how
soon
it
would
walk
and
talk
and
when
would
it
grow
its
teeth
and
hair
burke
was
feeling
really
quite
keenly
these
days
the
solemnity
and
responsibility
of
fatherhood
he
had
called
into
being
a
new
soul
a
little
life
was
in
his
hands
to
train
by
and
by
this
tiny
pink
roll
of
humanity
would
be
a
prattling
child
a
little
girl
a
young
lady
and
all
the
way
she
would
be
turning
to
him
for
companionship
and
guidance
it
behooved
him
indeed
to
look
well
to
himself
that
he
should
be
in
all
ways
a
fit
pattern
it
was
a
solemn
thought
no
more
tempers
tantrums
and
impatience
no
more
idle
repinings
and
useless
regrets
what
mattered
it
if
he
were
disillusioned
and
heartsick
did
he
want
this
child
of
his
this
beautiful
daughter
to
grow
up
in
such
an
atmosphere
never
at
once
therefore
he
must
begin
to
cultivate
patience
contentment
tranquillity
and
calmness
of
soul
he
the
pattern
must
be
all
things
that
he
would
wish
her
to
be
and
how
delightful
it
would
be
when
she
was
old
enough
to
meet
him
on
his
own
ground
to
be
a
companion
for
him
the
companion
he
had
not
found
in
his
wife
she
would
be
pretty
of
course
and
cheerful
was
he
not
to
train
her
himself
she
would
be
capable
and
sensible
too
he
would
see
to
that
to
no
man
in
the
future
should
she
bring
the
tragedy
of
disillusionment
that
her
mother
had
brought
to
no
indeed
for
that
matter
however
he
should
not
let
her
marry
any
one
for
a
long
time
he
should
keep
her
himself
perhaps
he
would
not
let
her
marry
at
all
he
did
not
think
much
of
this
marriage
business
anyway
not
that
he
was
going
to
show
that
feeling
any
longer
now
of
course
from
now
on
he
was
to
show
only
calm
contentment
and
tranquillity
of
soul
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
was
he
not
a
father
had
he
not
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
a
precious
young
life
to
train
again
all
this
was
very
well
in
theory
but
in
practice
dorothy
elizabeth
was
not
six
months
old
before
the
young
father
discovered
that
parenthood
changed
conditions
not
people
he
felt
just
as
irritated
at
the
way
helen
buttered
a
whole
slice
of
bread
at
a
time
and
said
swell
and
you
was
as
before
just
as
impatient
because
he
could
not
buy
what
he
wanted
just
as
annoyed
at
the
purple
cushion
on
the
red
sofa
he
was
surprised
and
disappointed
he
told
himself
that
he
had
supposed
that
when
a
fellow
made
good
resolutions
he
was
given
some
show
of
a
chance
to
keep
them
but
as
if
any
one
cultivate
calm
contentment
and
tranquillity
of
soul
as
he
was
situated
first
there
were
not
only
all
his
old
disappointments
and
annoyances
to
contend
with
but
a
multitude
of
new
ones
it
was
as
if
indeed
each
particular
torment
had
taken
unto
itself
wife
and
children
so
numerous
had
they
become
there
was
really
now
no
peace
at
home
there
was
nothing
but
the
baby
he
had
not
supposed
that
any
one
thing
or
person
could
so
monopolize
everything
and
everybody
when
the
baby
was
awake
helen
acted
as
if
she
thought
the
earth
swung
on
its
axis
solely
to
amuse
it
when
it
slept
she
seemed
to
think
the
earth
ought
to
stand
still
lest
it
wake
baby
up
with
the
same
wholesale
tyranny
she
marshaled
into
line
everything
and
everybody
on
the
earth
plainly
regarding
nothing
and
no
one
as
of
consequence
except
in
its
relationship
to
baby
such
unimportant
things
as
meals
and
housework
in
comparison
with
baby
were
of
even
less
than
second
consequence
and
burke
grew
to
feel
himself
more
and
more
an
alien
and
a
nuisance
in
his
own
home
moreover
where
before
he
had
found
disorder
and
untidiness
he
now
found
positive
chaos
and
however
fond
he
was
of
the
baby
he
grew
unutterably
weary
of
searching
for
his
belongings
among
baby
rattles
balls
shirts
socks
milk
bottles
blankets
and
the
cool
calm
serenity
of
his
determination
he
found
it
difficult
to
realize
and
the
delights
and
responsibilities
of
fatherhood
began
to
pall
upon
him
it
looked
to
be
so
long
a
way
ahead
even
to
teeth
talking
and
walking
to
say
nothing
of
the
charm
and
companionship
of
a
young
lady
daughter
children
were
all
very
well
of
course
very
desirable
but
did
they
never
do
anything
but
cry
could
they
be
taught
that
nights
were
for
sleep
and
that
other
people
in
the
house
had
some
rights
besides
themselves
and
must
they
choose
four
in
the
morning
for
a
fit
of
the
colic
helen
said
it
was
colic
for
his
part
he
believed
it
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
temper
plain
temper
and
so
it
went
another
winter
passed
and
spring
came
matters
were
no
better
but
rather
worse
a
series
of
incompetent
maids
had
been
adding
considerably
to
the
expense
and
little
to
the
comfort
of
the
household
helen
as
a
mistress
was
not
a
success
she
understood
neither
her
own
duties
nor
those
of
the
maid
which
resulted
in
short
periods
of
poor
service
and
frequent
changes
july
came
with
its
stifling
heat
and
dorothy
elizabeth
now
twenty
months
old
showed
a
daily
increasing
disapproval
of
life
in
general
and
of
her
own
existence
in
particular
helen
worn
and
worried
and
half
sick
from
care
and
loss
of
sleep
grew
day
by
day
more
fretful
more
difficult
to
get
along
with
burke
also
half
sick
from
loss
of
sleep
and
consumed
with
a
fierce
inward
rebellion
against
everything
and
everybody
including
himself
was
no
less
difficult
to
get
along
with
of
course
this
state
of
affairs
could
not
continue
forever
the
tension
had
to
snap
sometime
and
it
snapped
over
a
bottle
of
ink
in
a
hand
it
happened
on
bridget
afternoon
out
when
helen
was
alone
with
the
baby
dorothy
elizabeth
propped
up
in
her
beside
the
table
where
her
mother
was
writing
a
letter
reached
covetous
hands
toward
the
fascinating
little
fat
black
bottle
the
next
instant
a
wild
shout
of
glee
and
an
inky
tide
surging
from
an
bottle
held
high
above
a
golden
head
told
that
the
quest
had
been
successful
things
happened
then
very
fast
there
were
a
dismayed
cry
from
helen
half
angry
spats
on
a
tiny
hand
a
series
of
shrieks
from
dorothy
elizabeth
and
a
rapidly
spreading
inky
pall
over
baby
dress
table
rug
and
helen
new
frock
at
that
moment
burke
appeared
in
the
door
with
wrathful
eyes
he
swept
the
scene
before
him
losing
not
one
detail
of
scolding
woman
shrieking
child
dinnerless
table
and
inky
chaos
then
he
strode
into
the
room
well
by
george
he
snapped
nice
restful
place
for
a
tired
man
to
come
to
is
it
this
is
your
idea
of
a
happy
home
i
suppose
the
overwrought
wife
and
mother
with
every
nerve
tingling
turned
sharply
oh
yes
that
right
blame
me
blame
me
for
everything
maybe
you
think
think
this
is
a
happy
restful
place
too
maybe
you
think
this
is
what
thought
be
being
married
to
you
but
i
can
tell
you
it
just
is
maybe
you
think
i
ai
tired
of
working
and
pinching
and
slaving
and
never
having
any
fun
and
being
scolded
and
blamed
all
the
time
because
i
do
eat
and
walk
and
stand
up
and
sit
down
the
way
you
want
me
to
and
where
are
you
goin
she
broke
off
as
her
husband
reached
for
the
hat
he
had
just
tossed
aside
and
started
for
the
door
burke
turned
quietly
his
face
was
very
white
i
going
down
to
the
square
to
get
something
to
eat
then
i
going
up
to
father
and
you
need
sit
up
for
me
i
shall
stay
all
night
night
yes
i
like
to
sleep
for
once
and
that
what
i
ca
do
here
the
next
moment
the
door
had
banged
behind
him
helen
left
alone
with
the
baby
fell
back
limply
why
baby
he
he
then
she
caught
the
little
figure
to
her
and
began
to
cry
convulsively
in
the
street
outside
burke
strode
along
with
his
head
high
and
his
jaw
sternly
set
he
was
very
angry
he
told
himself
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
angry
surely
a
man
was
entitled
to
consideration
in
spite
of
it
all
however
there
was
in
a
corner
of
his
soul
an
uneasy
consciousness
of
a
tiny
voice
of
scorn
dubbing
this
running
away
of
his
the
act
of
a
coward
and
a
cad
very
resolutely
however
he
silenced
this
voice
by
recounting
again
to
himself
how
really
abused
he
was
it
was
a
long
story
it
served
to
occupy
his
mind
all
through
the
unappetizing
meal
he
tried
to
eat
at
the
cheap
restaurant
before
climbing
elm
hill
his
father
greeted
him
cordially
and
with
no
surprise
in
voice
or
manner
which
was
what
burke
had
expected
inasmuch
as
he
had
again
fallen
into
the
way
of
spending
frequent
evenings
at
the
old
home
however
burke
himself
was
constrained
and
ill
at
ease
his
jaw
was
still
firmly
set
and
his
head
was
still
high
but
his
heart
was
beginning
to
fail
him
and
his
mind
was
full
of
questionings
how
would
his
father
take
it
this
proposition
to
stay
all
night
he
would
understand
something
of
what
it
meant
he
could
not
help
but
understand
but
what
would
he
say
how
would
he
act
would
he
say
in
actions
if
not
in
words
that
dreaded
i
told
you
so
would
it
unseal
his
lips
on
a
subject
so
long
tabooed
and
set
him
into
a
lengthy
dissertation
on
the
foolishness
of
his
son
marriage
burke
believed
that
as
he
felt
now
he
could
not
stand
that
but
he
could
stand
less
easily
going
back
to
the
dale
street
flat
that
night
he
could
go
to
a
hotel
of
course
but
he
did
not
want
to
do
that
he
wanted
dad
but
he
did
not
want
dad
to
talk
how
the
baby
asked
john
denby
as
burke
dropped
himself
into
a
chair
on
the
cool
quiet
veranda
i
thought
she
was
not
looking
very
well
the
last
time
helen
wheeled
her
up
here
always
john
denby
first
inquiry
now
was
for
his
little
granddaughter
eh
the
baby
oh
she
she
all
right
that
is
burke
paused
for
a
short
laugh
she
john
denby
took
his
cigar
from
his
lips
and
turned
sharply
but
she
all
right
burke
laughed
again
oh
yes
she
all
right
too
i
suppose
he
retorted
a
bit
grimly
but
she
was
er
humph
well
i
tell
you
and
he
gave
a
graphic
description
of
his
return
home
that
night
jove
what
a
mess
and
too
ejaculated
john
denby
with
more
than
a
tinge
of
sympathy
in
his
voice
how
she
ever
manage
to
clean
it
up
burke
shrugged
his
shoulders
ask
me
something
easy
i
do
know
i
sure
i
cleared
out
without
your
dinner
john
denby
asked
the
question
after
a
very
brief
but
very
tense
silence
my
dinner
i
got
in
the
square
burke
lips
snapped
together
again
tight
shut
john
denby
said
nothing
his
eyes
were
gravely
fixed
on
the
glowing
tip
of
the
cigar
in
his
hand
burke
cleared
his
throat
and
hesitated
he
had
not
intended
to
ask
his
question
quite
so
soon
but
suddenly
he
was
consumed
with
an
overwhelming
desire
to
speak
out
and
get
it
over
he
cleared
his
throat
again
dad
would
you
mind
my
sleeping
here
it
just
that
i
i
want
a
good
night
sleep
for
once
he
plunged
on
hurriedly
in
answer
to
a
swift
something
that
he
saw
leap
to
his
father
eyes
and
i
get
it
there
with
the
baby
and
all
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
then
steadily
and
with
easy
cordiality
came
john
denby
reply
why
certainly
my
boy
i
glad
to
have
you
i
ring
at
once
for
benton
to
see
that
that
your
old
room
is
made
ready
for
you
he
added
touching
a
near
his
chair
later
when
benton
had
come
and
gone
with
his
kindly
old
face
alight
and
eager
burke
braced
himself
for
what
he
thought
was
inevitable
something
would
come
of
course
the
only
question
was
what
would
it
be
but
nothing
came
that
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
what
burke
had
expected
john
denby
after
benton
had
left
the
veranda
turned
to
his
son
with
a
pleasantly
casual
oh
brett
was
saying
that
the
people
had
granted
us
an
extension
of
time
on
that
bridge
contract
er
yes
plunged
in
burke
warmly
and
with
the
words
every
taut
nerve
and
muscle
in
his
body
relaxed
as
if
cut
in
twain
it
came
later
though
when
he
had
ceased
to
look
for
it
it
came
just
as
he
was
thinking
of
saying
it
has
occurred
to
me
son
broached
john
denby
after
a
short
pause
that
helen
may
be
tired
and
in
sore
need
of
a
rest
burke
caught
his
breath
and
held
it
a
moment
suspended
when
before
had
his
father
mentioned
helen
save
to
speak
of
her
casually
in
connection
with
the
baby
er
er
very
likely
he
stammered
a
sudden
vision
coming
to
him
of
helen
as
he
had
seen
her
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
inky
chaos
a
short
time
before
you
not
the
only
one
that
is
finding
the
present
state
of
affairs
a
a
bed
of
roses
burke
said
john
denby
then
er
ah
muttered
the
amazed
husband
in
his
ears
now
rang
helen
maybe
you
think
i
ai
tired
of
working
and
pinching
and
slaving
involuntarily
he
shivered
and
glanced
at
his
father
dad
could
not
of
course
have
i
have
a
plan
to
propose
announced
john
denby
quietly
after
a
moment
silence
as
i
said
i
think
helen
needs
a
rest
and
a
change
i
seen
quite
a
little
of
her
since
the
baby
came
you
know
and
noticed
many
things
i
will
send
her
a
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
if
she
will
take
the
baby
and
go
away
for
a
time
say
to
her
old
home
for
a
visit
but
there
is
one
other
condition
he
continued
lifting
a
quick
hand
to
silence
burke
excited
interruption
i
need
a
rest
and
change
myself
i
should
like
to
go
to
alaska
again
and
like
to
have
you
go
with
me
will
you
go
burke
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
wide
veranda
from
boyhood
burke
had
always
thrashed
things
out
on
his
feet
for
a
full
minute
now
he
said
nothing
then
abruptly
he
stopped
and
wheeled
about
his
face
was
very
white
dad
i
ca
it
seems
too
much
like
like
no
it
is
in
the
least
like
quitting
or
running
away
supplied
john
denby
reading
unerringly
his
son
hesitation
you
not
quitting
at
all
i
asking
you
to
go
indeed
i
begging
you
to
go
burke
i
want
you
i
need
you
i
not
an
old
man
i
know
but
i
feel
like
one
these
last
two
years
have
not
been
er
a
bed
of
roses
for
me
either
in
spite
of
a
certain
lightness
in
his
words
the
man
voice
shook
a
little
i
do
think
you
know
boy
how
your
old
dad
has
missed
you
do
i
i
can
guess
burke
wheeled
and
resumed
his
nervous
stride
the
words
as
he
flung
them
out
were
at
once
a
challenge
and
an
admission
but
helen
he
stopped
short
waiting
i
answered
that
i
told
you
helen
needs
a
rest
and
a
change
again
to
the
distraught
husband
ears
came
the
echo
of
a
wailing
maybe
you
think
i
ai
tired
of
working
and
pinching
and
slaving
then
you
do
think
helen
will
feel
that
i
running
away
a
growing
hope
was
in
his
eyes
but
his
brow
still
carried
its
frown
of
doubt
not
if
she
has
a
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
replied
john
denby
a
bit
grimly
burke
winced
a
painful
red
reached
his
forehead
it
is
indeed
a
large
sum
sir
too
large
he
resented
with
sudden
stiffness
thank
you
but
i
afraid
we
ca
accept
it
after
all
john
denby
saw
his
mistake
at
once
but
he
did
not
make
the
second
mistake
of
showing
it
nonsense
he
laughed
lightly
with
no
sign
of
the
sudden
panic
of
fear
within
him
lest
the
look
on
his
son
face
meant
the
downfall
of
all
his
plans
i
made
it
large
purposely
remember
i
borrowing
her
husband
for
a
season
and
she
needs
some
recompense
besides
it
mean
a
playday
for
herself
you
not
be
so
unjust
to
helen
as
to
refuse
her
the
means
to
enjoy
that
not
that
she
spend
it
all
for
that
of
course
but
it
will
be
a
comfortable
feeling
to
know
that
she
has
it
of
course
hesitated
burke
still
frowning
then
we
call
that
settled
i
know
but
of
course
if
you
put
it
way
why
i
well
i
do
put
it
just
that
way
nodded
the
father
lightly
now
let
go
in
i
got
some
maps
and
i
want
you
to
see
planning
a
different
route
from
the
one
we
took
with
the
doctor
a
better
one
i
think
but
let
see
what
you
say
come
and
he
led
the
way
to
the
library
burke
head
came
up
alertly
his
shoulders
lost
their
droop
and
his
brow
its
frown
a
new
light
flamed
into
his
eyes
and
a
new
springiness
leaped
into
his
step
always
from
the
time
his
lips
had
begged
to
see
the
wheels
go
had
burke
chief
passion
and
delight
been
traveling
as
he
bent
now
over
the
maps
and
that
his
father
spread
before
him
voice
and
hands
fairly
trembled
with
eagerness
then
suddenly
a
chance
word
sent
him
to
his
feet
again
the
old
look
of
despair
on
his
face
dad
i
ca
he
choked
i
ca
be
a
quitter
you
do
want
me
to
be
illustration
john
denby
went
straight
to
his
son
and
laid
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
with
a
sharp
word
john
denby
too
leaped
to
his
feet
something
of
the
dogged
persistence
that
had
won
for
him
wealth
and
power
glowed
in
his
eyes
as
he
went
straight
to
his
son
and
laid
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
burke
i
had
not
meant
to
say
this
he
began
quietly
but
perhaps
it
just
as
well
that
i
do
possibly
you
think
i
been
blind
all
these
past
months
but
i
have
i
seen
a
good
deal
now
i
want
you
and
helen
to
be
happy
i
do
want
to
see
your
life
or
hers
wrecked
i
believe
there
a
chance
yet
for
you
two
people
to
travel
together
with
some
measure
of
peace
and
comfort
and
i
trying
to
give
you
that
chance
there
just
one
thing
to
do
i
believe
and
that
is
to
be
away
from
each
other
for
a
while
you
both
need
it
for
weeks
i
been
planning
and
scheming
how
it
could
be
done
how
do
you
suppose
i
happened
to
have
this
alaska
trip
all
cut
and
dried
even
down
to
the
train
and
boat
schedules
if
i
had
done
some
thinking
came
my
chance
so
i
spoke
but
to
be
a
quitter
you
not
quitting
you
stopping
to
get
your
breath
there
my
work
you
made
good
and
more
than
good
there
son
i
been
proud
of
you
every
inch
of
the
way
you
no
quitter
there
thanks
dad
only
the
sudden
mist
in
his
eyes
and
the
shake
in
his
voice
showed
how
really
moved
burke
was
but
helen
he
stammered
then
will
be
better
off
without
you
for
a
time
and
i
will
be
better
off
without
her
for
the
same
time
while
i
shall
be
oh
so
infinitely
better
off
you
ah
son
but
i
missed
you
so
it
was
the
same
longing
cry
that
had
gone
straight
to
burke
heart
a
few
minutes
before
you
come
there
was
a
tense
silence
burke
face
plainly
showed
the
struggle
within
him
a
moment
more
and
he
spoke
dad
i
have
to
think
it
out
he
temporized
brokenly
i
let
you
know
in
the
morning
good
if
john
denby
was
disappointed
he
did
not
show
it
we
let
it
go
till
morning
then
meanwhile
it
can
do
no
harm
to
look
at
these
however
he
smiled
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
maps
and
no
of
course
not
acquiesced
burke
promptly
relieved
that
his
father
agreed
so
willingly
to
the
delay
half
an
hour
later
he
went
upstairs
to
his
old
room
to
bed
it
was
a
fine
old
room
he
had
forgotten
that
a
bedroom
could
be
so
large
and
so
convenient
benton
plainly
had
been
there
also
plainly
his
hand
had
not
lost
its
cunning
nor
his
brain
the
memory
of
how
master
burke
liked
things
the
arrangement
of
the
lights
the
glass
of
milk
by
his
bed
the
spread
and
sheet
the
latest
magazine
ready
to
his
hand
even
the
size
and
number
of
towels
in
his
bathroom
testified
to
benton
loving
hand
and
good
memory
with
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
sob
burke
dropped
himself
into
a
chair
and
looked
about
him
it
was
all
so
peaceful
so
restful
so
comfortable
and
it
was
so
quiet
he
had
forgotten
that
a
room
could
be
so
quiet
in
spite
of
his
weariness
burke
preparations
for
bed
were
both
lengthy
and
luxurious
he
had
forgotten
what
absolute
content
lay
in
plenty
of
space
towels
and
hot
water
to
say
nothing
of
soap
that
was
in
its
proper
place
and
did
not
have
to
be
fished
out
of
a
or
a
kitchen
sink
burke
did
not
intend
to
go
to
sleep
at
once
he
intended
first
to
settle
in
his
mind
what
he
would
do
with
this
proposition
of
his
father
he
would
have
to
refuse
it
of
course
it
would
not
do
still
he
ought
to
give
it
proper
consideration
for
dad
sake
that
much
was
due
dad
he
stretched
himself
luxuriously
on
the
bed
he
had
forgotten
that
a
bed
could
be
so
soft
and
so
just
right
and
began
to
think
but
the
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
waking
up
his
first
feeling
was
a
but
delightful
sensation
of
physical
comfort
his
next
a
dazed
surprise
as
his
slowly
opened
eyes
encountered
shapes
and
shadows
and
beams
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
quite
unlike
those
in
his
dale
street
bedroom
then
instantly
came
a
vague
but
poignant
impression
that
something
had
happened
followed
almost
as
quickly
by
full
realization
like
a
panorama
then
the
preceding
evening
lay
before
him
helen
the
crying
baby
the
trailing
ink
the
angry
words
the
flight
dad
his
welcome
the
pleasant
chat
the
remarkable
proposition
oh
yes
and
it
was
of
the
proposition
that
he
was
going
to
think
he
could
not
accept
it
of
course
but
what
a
trump
dad
had
been
to
offer
it
what
a
trump
he
had
been
in
the
he
offered
it
too
what
a
trump
he
had
been
all
through
about
it
for
that
matter
not
a
word
of
reproach
not
a
hint
of
patronage
not
even
a
look
that
could
be
construed
into
that
hated
i
told
you
so
just
a
offer
of
this
check
for
helen
and
the
trip
for
himself
and
actually
in
a
casual
tone
of
voice
as
if
checks
and
alaskan
trips
were
everyday
occurrences
but
they
were
a
trip
like
that
did
not
drop
into
a
man
plate
every
day
of
course
he
could
not
take
it
but
what
a
dandy
one
it
would
be
and
with
dad
for
that
matter
dad
really
needed
him
dad
ought
not
to
go
off
like
that
alone
and
so
far
besides
dad
him
how
his
voice
had
trembled
when
he
had
said
i
do
think
you
know
boy
how
your
old
dad
has
missed
you
as
if
he
did
indeed
as
if
he
had
done
missing
on
his
own
account
and
the
check
of
course
he
could
not
let
helen
accept
that
either
ten
thousand
dollars
but
how
generous
of
dad
to
offer
it
and
of
course
it
be
good
for
helen
poor
helen
she
needed
a
rest
all
right
and
she
deserved
one
it
be
fine
for
her
to
go
back
to
her
old
home
town
for
a
little
while
and
no
mistake
not
that
she
would
need
to
spend
the
whole
ten
thousand
dollars
on
that
of
course
but
even
a
little
slice
of
a
sum
like
that
would
give
her
all
the
frills
and
furbelows
she
wanted
for
herself
and
the
baby
and
send
them
into
the
country
for
all
the
rest
of
the
summer
besides
leaving
of
it
for
a
for
the
future
and
what
a
comfortable
feeling
it
would
give
her
always
a
little
money
when
she
wanted
it
for
anything
no
more
of
the
hated
pinching
and
starving
for
he
should
tell
her
to
spend
it
and
take
some
comfort
with
it
that
was
what
it
was
for
besides
when
it
was
gone
would
have
some
for
her
what
a
boon
it
would
be
to
her
that
ten
thousand
dollars
of
course
looking
at
it
in
that
light
it
was
almost
his
to
accept
the
proposition
and
give
her
the
chance
to
have
it
but
then
after
all
he
could
why
it
was
like
accepting
charity
he
had
earned
it
still
if
hard
work
and
anguish
of
mind
counted
he
earned
it
twice
over
slaving
away
at
the
beck
of
brett
and
his
minions
and
he
had
made
good
so
far
dad
had
said
so
what
a
trump
dad
was
to
speak
as
he
did
and
when
said
a
thing
like
that
it
meant
something
well
there
was
nothing
to
do
of
course
but
to
go
back
and
buckle
down
to
work
and
to
life
in
the
dale
street
flat
to
be
sure
there
was
the
baby
of
course
he
was
fond
of
the
baby
and
it
was
highly
interesting
to
see
her
achieve
teeth
hair
a
backbone
and
sense
if
only
she
would
hurry
up
a
little
faster
though
did
babies
always
take
so
long
to
grow
up
burke
stretched
himself
luxuriously
and
gazed
about
the
room
the
outside
had
gone
out
and
dawn
was
approaching
more
and
more
distinctly
each
loved
object
in
the
room
was
coming
into
view
to
his
nostrils
came
the
perfume
of
the
roses
and
honeysuckles
in
the
garden
below
his
window
to
his
ears
came
the
chirp
and
twitter
of
the
from
the
trees
over
his
senses
stole
the
soothing
peace
of
absolute
physical
ease
once
more
drowsily
he
went
back
to
his
father
offer
once
more
in
his
mind
he
argued
it
but
this
time
with
a
difference
thus
so
potent
sometimes
is
the
song
of
a
bird
the
scent
of
a
flower
the
shape
of
a
loved
familiar
object
or
even
the
feel
of
a
soft
bed
beneath
one
after
all
might
he
not
be
making
a
serious
mistake
if
he
did
not
accede
to
his
father
wishes
of
course
so
far
as
he
personally
was
concerned
the
answer
would
be
an
unequivocal
refusal
of
the
offer
but
there
was
his
father
to
consider
and
there
was
helen
to
think
of
yes
and
the
baby
how
much
better
it
would
be
for
them
for
all
of
them
if
he
accepted
it
helen
and
the
baby
could
have
months
of
fresh
air
ease
and
happiness
without
delay
to
say
nothing
of
innumerable
advantages
later
why
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
that
would
be
enough
if
there
were
nothing
else
but
there
was
something
else
there
was
dad
good
old
dad
how
happy
he
be
besides
dad
really
needed
him
how
ever
had
he
thought
for
a
moment
of
sending
dad
off
to
alaska
alone
and
just
after
an
illness
too
what
could
he
be
thinking
of
to
consider
it
for
a
moment
that
settled
it
he
should
go
he
would
stifle
all
silly
feelings
of
pride
and
the
like
and
he
would
make
dad
helen
and
the
baby
happy
which
question
having
been
satisfactorily
decided
burke
turned
over
and
settled
himself
for
a
doze
before
breakfast
he
did
not
get
it
however
his
mind
was
altogether
too
full
of
boat
schedules
mountain
peaks
and
forest
trails
jove
but
that
was
going
to
be
a
dandy
trip
it
was
later
while
burke
was
leisurely
dressing
and
planning
out
the
day
before
him
that
the
bothersome
question
came
to
him
as
to
how
he
should
tell
helen
he
was
reminded
also
emphatically
of
the
probable
scene
in
store
for
him
when
he
should
go
home
at
six
that
night
and
he
hated
scenes
for
that
matter
there
would
probably
be
another
one
too
when
he
told
her
that
he
was
going
away
for
a
time
to
be
sure
there
was
the
check
and
of
course
very
soon
he
could
convince
her
that
it
was
really
all
for
her
best
happiness
after
she
gave
it
a
little
thought
it
would
be
all
right
he
was
positive
but
there
was
certain
to
be
some
unpleasantness
at
first
particularly
as
she
was
sure
to
be
not
a
little
difficult
over
his
running
er
rather
away
the
night
before
and
he
wished
he
could
avoid
it
in
some
way
if
only
he
did
not
have
to
go
home
his
face
cleared
suddenly
why
of
course
he
would
write
how
stupid
of
him
not
to
have
thought
of
it
before
he
could
say
then
just
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
she
would
have
a
chance
to
think
it
over
calmly
and
sensibly
and
see
how
really
fine
it
was
for
her
and
the
baby
that
was
the
way
to
do
it
and
the
only
way
writing
he
could
not
be
unnerved
by
her
tears
of
course
she
would
cry
at
first
she
always
cried
or
exasperated
into
saying
things
he
would
be
sorry
for
afterwards
he
could
say
just
enough
and
not
too
much
in
a
letter
and
say
it
right
then
early
in
the
following
week
just
before
he
was
to
start
on
his
trip
he
would
go
down
to
the
dale
street
house
and
spend
the
last
two
or
three
days
with
helen
and
the
baby
picking
up
his
traps
and
planning
with
helen
some
of
the
delightful
things
she
could
do
with
that
ten
thousand
dollars
by
that
time
she
would
of
course
have
entirely
come
around
to
his
point
of
view
even
if
she
had
not
seen
it
quite
that
way
at
first
and
they
could
have
a
few
really
happy
days
together
something
which
would
be
quite
impossible
if
they
should
meet
now
with
the
preceding
evening
fresh
in
their
minds
and
have
one
of
their
usual
wretched
scenes
of
tears
recriminations
and
wranglings
for
the
present
then
he
would
stay
where
he
was
helen
would
be
all
right
with
bridget
his
father
would
be
overjoyed
he
knew
and
as
for
the
few
toilet
necessities
he
could
buy
those
he
needed
some
new
things
to
take
away
so
that
was
settled
with
a
mind
at
rest
again
and
a
heart
aflame
with
joy
burke
hurried
into
his
garments
and
skipped
downstairs
like
a
boy
his
face
before
his
lips
got
a
chance
told
his
father
of
his
decision
but
his
lips
did
not
lag
long
behind
he
had
expected
that
his
father
would
be
pleased
but
he
was
not
quite
prepared
for
the
depth
of
emotion
that
shook
his
father
voice
and
dimmed
his
father
eyes
and
that
ended
the
declaration
of
joy
with
what
was
very
near
a
sob
if
anything
indeed
were
needed
to
convince
burke
that
he
was
doing
just
right
in
taking
this
trip
with
his
father
it
could
be
needed
no
longer
after
the
look
of
ineffable
peace
and
joy
on
that
father
face
breakfast
with
so
much
to
talk
of
prolonged
itself
like
a
college
spread
until
burke
with
a
cry
of
dismay
pulled
out
his
watch
and
leaped
to
his
feet
jove
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
dad
he
cried
laughingly
behold
how
this
life
of
luxury
has
me
already
in
its
clutches
i
should
have
been
off
an
hour
ago
john
denby
lifted
a
detaining
hand
not
so
fast
my
boy
he
smiled
i
got
you
and
i
mean
to
keep
you
a
few
minutes
longer
but
oh
i
telephoned
brett
this
morning
that
you
would
be
down
till
late
if
you
came
at
all
you
telephoned
puzzled
burke
sinking
slowly
into
his
chair
again
but
you
did
know
then
that
i
he
stopped
once
more
no
i
did
know
then
that
you
agree
to
my
proposition
answered
john
denby
with
a
characteristically
grim
smile
but
i
knew
if
you
did
agree
we
have
some
talking
to
do
and
if
you
did
should
i
meant
still
to
convince
you
you
see
i
see
nodded
the
younger
man
smiling
in
his
turn
so
i
would
go
down
this
morning
we
lots
of
plans
to
make
besides
there
your
letter
yes
there
my
letter
this
time
the
young
man
did
not
smile
got
to
write
my
letter
of
course
chapter
x
by
advice
of
counsel
helen
denby
received
the
letter
from
her
husband
at
two
by
a
special
messenger
helen
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
and
an
unhappy
morning
the
surge
of
bitter
anger
which
at
first
like
the
ink
had
blackened
everything
it
touched
soon
spent
itself
and
left
her
weak
and
trembling
dorothy
elizabeth
after
her
somewhat
upsetting
day
sank
into
an
unusually
sound
slumber
but
her
mother
all
through
the
long
night
watches
lay
with
sleepless
eyes
staring
into
the
dark
thinking
helen
was
very
angry
with
burke
there
was
no
gainsaying
that
she
was
a
little
frightened
too
at
what
she
herself
had
said
in
a
soberer
moment
she
would
not
have
spoken
quite
like
that
certainly
but
it
had
been
so
hateful
his
asking
if
she
called
that
a
happy
home
as
if
she
did
not
want
a
happy
home
as
much
as
he
ever
could
to
helen
then
came
her
old
vision
of
the
daintily
gowned
wife
welcoming
her
husband
to
the
home
and
all
in
the
dark
her
cheek
flushed
hot
how
far
short
indeed
of
that
ideal
had
she
fallen
and
she
was
going
to
be
such
a
help
to
burke
such
an
inspiration
such
a
guide
counselor
and
friend
swiftly
the
words
came
galloping
out
of
that
honeymoon
had
she
helped
him
had
she
been
an
inspiration
and
a
guide
and
a
counselor
and
a
friend
poor
burke
he
given
up
a
good
deal
for
her
sake
with
the
consciousness
of
that
vacant
pillow
by
her
side
a
wave
of
remorseful
tenderness
swept
over
her
and
of
course
it
must
have
been
hard
for
him
they
had
told
him
not
to
marry
her
too
they
had
warned
him
that
she
was
not
suited
to
him
that
she
would
drag
him
with
a
low
cry
helen
sat
up
in
bed
suddenly
him
down
had
she
dragged
him
down
no
no
not
that
never
that
she
had
been
careless
and
thoughtless
she
had
not
been
a
good
housekeeper
and
maybe
sometimes
she
had
been
fretful
and
and
and
horrid
but
she
loved
him
dearly
she
had
always
loved
him
it
only
needed
something
like
this
to
show
her
how
much
she
loved
him
why
he
was
burke
her
husband
baby
father
as
if
ever
she
could
let
it
be
said
that
she
had
dragged
him
down
quivering
shaken
with
sobs
she
fell
back
on
the
pillow
for
a
few
moments
she
cried
on
convulsively
then
with
a
tremulous
indrawn
breath
she
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
into
the
dark
again
a
new
thought
had
come
to
her
but
there
was
time
yet
nothing
dreadful
had
happened
she
would
show
burke
his
friends
everybody
that
she
had
not
dragged
him
down
from
now
on
she
would
try
oh
how
she
would
try
he
should
see
he
find
a
happy
home
when
he
came
at
night
she
knew
more
now
than
she
did
about
housekeeping
besides
there
was
more
money
now
a
little
more
and
she
had
some
one
to
help
her
with
the
work
bridget
was
really
doing
very
well
and
there
was
cobb
so
kind
and
helpful
she
would
go
to
her
for
advice
always
never
again
should
burke
come
home
and
find
such
a
looking
place
baby
should
be
washed
and
dressed
she
herself
would
be
dressed
and
waiting
dinner
too
even
on
day
out
should
be
all
ready
and
waiting
as
if
ever
again
she
would
run
the
risk
of
burke
having
to
flee
from
his
own
home
because
he
could
not
stand
it
he
should
see
it
was
in
this
softened
exalted
state
of
mind
that
helen
rose
the
next
morning
and
proceeded
to
begin
the
of
her
vows
by
essaying
the
almost
hopeless
task
with
bridget
not
overcheerful
assistance
of
putting
into
spotless
order
the
entire
apartment
at
two
when
burke
letter
came
she
was
utterly
weary
and
almost
sick
but
she
was
still
in
the
softened
exalted
state
of
the
early
morning
with
a
wondering
little
cry
at
sight
of
the
familiar
writing
she
began
to
read
john
denby
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
had
fallen
into
her
lap
unnoticed
dear
she
read
first
let
me
apologize
for
flying
off
the
handle
the
way
i
did
last
night
i
have
done
it
but
do
you
know
i
believe
i
glad
i
did
for
it
taught
me
something
maybe
you
discovered
it
too
it
this
you
and
i
have
been
getting
on
each
other
nerves
lately
we
need
a
rest
from
each
other
now
do
bristle
up
and
take
it
wrong
my
dear
just
be
sensible
and
think
how
many
times
a
day
do
we
snap
and
snarl
at
each
other
you
tired
and
half
sick
with
the
work
and
the
baby
i
tired
and
half
sick
with
work
and
we
always
rubbing
each
other
the
wrong
way
why
i
think
we
need
a
vacation
from
each
other
and
dad
has
made
it
possible
for
us
to
take
one
he
wants
me
to
go
to
alaska
with
him
on
a
little
trip
i
want
to
go
of
course
then
too
i
think
i
ought
to
go
dad
needs
me
not
that
he
is
old
but
he
is
just
getting
over
an
illness
and
his
head
bothers
him
a
lot
i
can
be
of
real
use
to
him
at
his
own
suggestion
he
is
sending
you
the
enclosed
check
he
wants
you
to
accept
it
with
his
best
wishes
for
a
pleasant
vacation
he
suggests
and
i
echo
him
that
it
would
be
a
fine
idea
if
you
should
take
the
baby
and
go
back
to
your
home
town
for
a
visit
i
know
your
father
and
mother
are
not
living
but
there
must
be
some
one
there
whom
you
would
like
to
visit
or
better
yet
now
that
you
have
the
means
you
would
probably
prefer
a
good
hotel
for
headquarters
and
then
make
short
visits
to
all
your
friends
it
would
do
you
worlds
of
good
and
baby
too
and
now
i
writing
this
instead
of
coming
to
tell
it
face
to
face
because
i
believe
it
the
best
way
i
be
frank
after
last
night
we
might
say
things
when
we
first
met
that
we
be
sorry
for
and
i
do
want
that
to
happen
so
going
to
stay
up
here
for
a
day
or
two
let
me
see
is
friday
we
are
due
to
leave
next
wednesday
i
be
down
the
first
of
the
week
to
say
and
pick
up
my
traps
meanwhile
chicken
you
be
all
right
with
bridget
there
and
just
you
put
your
wits
to
work
and
go
to
planning
out
that
vacation
of
yours
and
how
you
going
to
spend
the
money
then
you
can
be
ready
to
tell
me
all
about
it
when
i
come
down
your
affectionate
husband
burke
helen
first
feeling
upon
finishing
the
note
was
one
of
utter
stupefaction
with
a
dazed
frown
and
a
low
ejaculation
she
turned
the
letter
over
and
began
to
read
it
again
more
slowly
this
time
she
understood
but
her
thoughts
were
still
in
a
whirl
of
surprised
disbelief
then
gradually
came
a
measure
of
conviction
fresh
from
her
vigils
of
the
night
before
with
its
and
its
heroic
resolutions
she
was
so
chastened
and
softened
that
there
was
more
of
grief
than
of
anger
in
her
first
outburst
she
began
to
cry
a
little
wildly
burke
was
going
away
he
to
go
he
said
they
they
got
on
each
other
nerves
he
said
they
needed
a
vacation
from
each
other
one
as
if
they
did
it
was
that
it
was
his
father
idea
knew
it
was
all
his
fault
but
he
was
going
burke
was
he
said
he
was
there
would
not
be
any
chance
now
to
show
him
the
daintily
gowned
wife
welcoming
her
husband
home
to
a
house
there
would
not
be
any
chance
to
show
how
she
had
changed
there
would
not
be
but
there
would
be
after
he
came
back
helen
stopped
sobbing
and
caught
her
breath
with
a
new
hope
in
her
eyes
dorothy
elizabeth
began
to
cry
and
helen
picked
her
up
and
commenced
to
rock
her
of
course
there
be
time
after
he
came
back
and
after
all
might
it
not
be
the
wisest
thing
to
be
away
from
each
other
for
a
time
why
even
this
little
while
a
single
night
of
burke
being
gone
had
shown
her
where
she
stood
had
shown
her
where
it
was
all
leading
to
of
course
it
was
the
best
way
and
burke
had
seen
it
it
was
right
that
he
should
go
and
had
they
not
provided
for
her
she
was
to
go
there
was
a
check
somewhere
burrowing
in
her
lap
under
dorothy
elizabeth
warm
little
body
helen
dragged
forth
an
oblong
bit
of
crumpled
paper
carefully
she
spread
it
flat
the
next
moment
her
eyes
flew
wide
open
one
thousand
dollars
no
thousand
it
could
be
but
it
was
ten
thousand
dollars
and
she
had
been
scolding
and
blaming
them
when
all
the
time
they
had
been
so
generous
and
it
really
the
best
way
too
that
they
should
be
apart
for
a
while
it
would
give
her
a
chance
to
adjust
herself
and
practice
and
it
would
need
some
practice
if
she
were
really
going
to
be
that
daintily
gowned
young
wife
welcoming
her
husband
to
a
home
and
with
ten
thousand
dollars
what
could
they
get
with
ten
thousand
dollars
dorothy
elizabeth
at
that
moment
emitted
a
sharp
frightened
cry
for
how
was
dorothy
elizabeth
to
know
that
the
spasmodic
pressure
that
so
hurt
her
was
really
only
a
hug
of
joy
in
less
than
half
an
hour
helen
leaving
the
baby
with
bridget
had
sought
cobb
she
could
keep
her
good
news
no
longer
i
came
to
tell
you
i
going
away
baby
and
i
she
announced
joyously
we
going
next
week
jiminy
you
do
say
so
but
you
do
mean
you
goin
away
ter
oh
no
just
for
a
visit
to
my
old
home
town
where
i
was
born
only
be
a
good
long
one
you
see
we
need
a
rest
and
a
change
so
much
baby
and
i
do
there
was
a
shade
of
importance
in
voice
and
manner
that
you
do
exclaimed
cobb
with
emphasis
and
i
glad
goin
but
sakes
alive
i
goin
ter
miss
ye
child
i
shall
miss
you
too
beamed
helen
cordially
how
long
you
goin
ter
be
gone
i
do
know
exactly
it
depend
some
on
burke
i
mean
denby
when
he
wants
me
to
come
back
oh
ai
he
goin
too
an
indefinable
change
came
to
voice
oh
no
not
with
us
smiled
helen
he
going
to
alaska
to
and
pray
what
he
chasin
off
to
a
heathen
country
like
that
for
tis
heathen
alaska
is
flashed
helen
vaguely
irritated
without
knowing
why
heathen
countries
are
are
always
hot
alaska
cold
is
alaska
up
north
to
the
pole
it
used
to
be
when
i
went
to
school
maybe
is
but
that
ai
sayin
why
he
goin
there
instead
of
with
you
retorted
cobb
in
spite
of
the
bantering
tone
in
which
this
was
uttered
disapproval
was
plainly
evident
in
cobb
voice
he
going
with
his
father
answered
helen
with
some
dignity
his
father
humph
this
time
the
disapproval
was
so
unmistakably
evident
that
helen
flamed
into
prompt
defense
in
righteous
wifely
indignation
i
do
know
why
you
speak
like
that
cobb
has
he
got
a
right
to
go
with
his
father
if
he
wants
to
besides
his
father
needs
him
burke
says
he
does
and
do
need
him
i
flamed
cobb
in
her
turn
nettled
that
her
sympathetic
interest
should
meet
with
so
poor
a
welcome
of
course
it
none
of
my
business
mis
denby
but
it
seems
a
shame
to
me
for
him
ter
let
you
and
the
baby
go
off
alone
like
this
and
so
i
spoke
right
out
i
always
speak
right
out
what
i
think
helen
flushed
angrily
however
much
she
might
find
fault
with
her
husband
herself
she
suddenly
discovered
a
strong
disinclination
to
allowing
any
one
else
to
do
so
besides
now
when
he
and
his
father
had
been
so
kind
and
generous
she
had
not
meant
to
tell
cobb
of
the
check
lest
it
lead
to
unpleasant
questioning
as
to
why
it
was
sent
but
now
in
the
face
of
cobb
unjust
criticism
she
flung
caution
aside
you
very
kind
she
began
a
bit
haughtily
but
you
see
this
time
you
have
made
a
slight
mistake
i
do
think
it
a
shame
at
all
for
him
to
go
away
with
his
father
who
needs
him
and
you
wo
when
you
know
what
they
sent
me
they
sent
me
a
check
this
afternoon
for
ten
thousand
dollars
thousand
dollars
yes
bowed
helen
with
a
triumphant
air
as
cobb
eyes
seemed
almost
to
pop
out
of
her
head
they
sent
it
this
very
afternoon
for
the
land
sake
breathed
cobb
then
as
her
dazed
wits
began
to
collect
themselves
a
new
look
came
to
her
eyes
they
it
she
cried
by
special
messenger
yes
bowed
helen
again
importantly
but
how
funny
to
it
instead
of
bringing
it
himself
your
husband
i
mean
too
late
helen
saw
her
mistake
in
a
panic
now
lest
unpleasant
truths
be
discovered
she
assumed
an
especially
light
cheerful
manner
oh
no
i
do
think
it
was
funny
a
bit
he
he
wanted
it
a
surprise
i
guess
and
he
wrote
a
letter
you
know
a
lovely
letter
all
about
what
a
good
time
baby
and
i
could
have
with
the
money
the
suspicion
in
cobb
eyes
became
swift
conviction
an
angry
red
stained
her
cheeks
but
it
was
not
anger
at
helen
that
was
clearly
to
be
seen
look
mis
denby
she
began
resolutely
i
a
plain
woman
and
i
always
speak
right
out
and
i
your
friend
too
and
i
ai
ter
stand
by
and
see
you
made
a
fool
of
and
not
try
ter
lift
a
hand
ter
help
there
somethin
wrong
here
if
you
do
know
it
it
time
you
did
if
you
know
it
and
are
tryin
ter
keep
it
from
me
you
might
just
as
well
stop
right
now
and
turn
and
tell
me
all
about
it
as
i
said
before
i
your
friend
and
if
it
what
i
think
it
is
you
a
friend
you
poor
little
thing
now
what
is
it
helen
shook
her
head
feebly
her
face
went
from
white
to
red
and
back
again
to
white
still
determined
to
keep
her
secret
if
possible
she
made
a
brave
attempt
to
regain
her
old
airiness
of
manner
why
cobb
it
nothing
nothing
at
all
cobb
exploded
into
voluble
wrath
nothin
is
it
when
a
man
goes
kitin
off
ter
alaska
and
sendin
his
wife
ten
thousand
dollars
ter
go
somewheres
else
in
the
opposite
direction
maybe
you
think
i
do
know
what
that
means
but
i
do
and
he
tryin
ter
play
a
mean
snivelin
trick
on
ye
and
i
ai
ter
stand
for
it
i
never
did
like
him
with
all
his
fine
lordly
airs
himself
better
than
anybody
else
what
walked
the
earth
but
if
i
can
help
it
i
ai
goin
ter
see
you
cheated
out
of
your
just
deserts
cobb
expostulated
the
dismayed
dumfounded
wife
but
cobb
had
yet
more
to
say
i
tell
you
they
rich
them
denbys
be
rich
as
mud
and
as
for
you
off
with
a
measly
ten
thousand
dollars
they
sha
and
you
with
a
baby
ter
try
ter
bring
up
and
edyercate
the
idea
of
your
standin
for
a
separation
with
only
ten
thousand
separation
interrupted
helen
indignantly
as
soon
as
she
could
find
her
voice
it
is
a
separation
why
we
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
not
for
for
the
way
you
mean
it
what
is
it
then
why
it
just
a
a
playday
stammered
helen
still
trying
to
cling
to
the
remnant
of
her
secret
he
it
was
a
playday
that
i
was
to
go
off
and
have
a
good
time
with
baby
if
it
just
a
playday
why
did
he
give
it
to
you
ter
take
it
then
tell
me
that
why
he
he
going
with
his
father

is
retorted
cobb
grimly
and
he
goin
ter
keep
with
his
father
too
what
do

helen
lips
were
very
white
cobb
gave
an
impatient
gesture

snapped
cobb
ruthlessly
freeing
her
mind
regardless
of
the
very
evident
suffering
on
her
listener
face
and
it
just
made
my
blood
boil
time

down

door

inside

stumbled
over
to

helen
rocking

arms

i
do
what
i
do
and
i
thought
it
was
just
as
he
said
she
went
on
chokingly
after
a
moment
pause
i
thought
it
was
a
vacation
he
wanted
us
to
take
we
we
got
on
each
other
nerves
but
it
was
baby
it
was
and
i
see
it
now
he
ashamed
of
me
he
always
been
ashamed
of
me
back
when
gleason
first
came
he
was
ashamed
of
me
then
baby
he
was
i
know
he
was
and
now
he
wants
to
get
away
quite
away
and
never
come
back
and
he
calls
it
a
and
he
says
to
have
one
too
and
i
must
tell
him
all
about
it
when
he
comes
down
next
week
maybe
he
thinks
i
will
he
thinks
i
will
we
wo
be
here
baby
we
wo
we
go
somewhere
somewhere
anywhere
before
he
gets
here
she
raved
burying
her
face
in
the
baby
neck
and
sobbing
hysterically
once
again
helen
passed
a
sleepless
night
never
questioning
now
cobb
interpretation
of
her
husband
conduct
there
remained
only
a
decision
as
to
her
own
course
of
action
that
she
could
not
be
there
when
her
husband
came
to
make
ready
for
his
journey
she
was
convinced
she
told
herself
fiercely
that
she
would
take
herself
and
the
baby
away
quite
away
out
of
his
sight
he
should
not
be
shamed
again
by
the
sight
of
her
but
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
she
was
fleeing
because
she
dared
not
go
through
that
last
meeting
with
her
husband
lest
she
should
break
down
and
she
did
not
want
to
break
down
if
burke
did
not
want
was
it
likely
she
was
going
to
cry
and
whine
and
let
him
know
that
she
want
him
certainly
not
helen
lips
came
together
in
a
thin
straight
line
in
spite
of
her
trembling
chin
between
her
hurt
love
and
her
wounded
pride
helen
was
in
just
that
state
of
hysterics
and
heroics
to
do
almost
anything
except
something
sane
and
sober
first
to
get
away
on
that
she
was
determined
but
where
to
go
that
was
the
question
as
for
going
back
to
the
old
home
town
as
burke
had
suggested
she
would
not
do
now
did
they
think
then
that
she
was
going
back
there
among
her
old
friends
to
be
laughed
at
and
gibed
at
what
if
she
did
have
ten
thousand
dollars
to
spend
on
frills
and
finery
to
dazzle
their
eyes
how
long
would
it
be
before
the
whole
town
found
out
as
had
cobb
that
that
ten
thousand
dollars
was
the
price
burke
denby
had
paid
for
his
freedom
from
the
wife
he
was
ashamed
of
never
she
would
not
go
there
but
where
could
she
go
it
was
then
that
a
plan
came
to
her
a
plan
so
wild
and
dazzling
that
even
her
frenzied
aspiration
scouted
it
at
first
as
impossible
but
it
came
again
and
again
and
before
long
her
fancy
was
playing
with
it
and
turning
it
about
with
a
wistful
of
course
if
i
could
which
in
time
became
a
hesitating
and
maybe
after
all
i
do
it
only
to
settle
at
last
into
a
breathlessly
triumphant
i
will
after
that
things
moved
very
swiftly
in
the
little
denby
flat
it
was
saturday
morning
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
first
helen
gathered
all
the
cash
she
had
in
the
house
not
forgetting
the
baby
bank
which
yielded
the
biggest
sum
of
all
and
counted
it
she
had
nineteen
dollars
and
seventeen
cents
then
she
rummaged
among
her
husband
letters
and
papers
until
she
found
a
letter
from
gleason
bearing
his
boston
address
next
with
bridget
to
help
her
she
flung
into
her
trunk
everything
belonging
to
herself
and
the
baby
that
it
was
possible
to
crowd
in
save
the
garments
laid
out
to
wear
by
three
bridget
was
paid
and
dismissed
and
helen
with
dorothy
elizabeth
was
waiting
for
the
carriage
to
take
them
to
the
railroad
station
with
the
same
tearless
exaltation
that
had
carried
her
through
the
prodigious
tasks
of
the
morning
helen
picked
up
her
bag
and
dorothy
elizabeth
and
followed
her
trunk
down
the
stairs
and
out
to
the
street
she
gave
not
one
backward
glance
to
the
little
home
and
she
carefully
avoided
anything
but
an
airy
to
the
watching
cobb
in
the
window
on
the
other
side
not
until
the
wheels
began
to
turn
and
the
journey
was
really
begun
did
helen
tearless
exaltation
become
the
frightened
anxiety
of
one
who
finds
herself
adrift
on
an
uncharted
sea
then
helen
began
to
cry
chapter
xi
in
quest
of
the
stars
in
a
roomy
old
house
on
beacon
hill
frank
gleason
made
his
home
with
his
sister
ellery
thayer
the
family
were
at
their
north
shore
cottage
however
and
only
the
doctor
was
at
home
on
the
night
that
hawkins
the
thayers
old
family
butler
appeared
at
the
library
door
with
the
somewhat
disconcerting
information
that
a
young
person
with
a
baby
and
a
bag
was
at
the
door
and
wished
to
speak
to
gleason
the
doctor
looked
up
in
surprise
me
he
questioned
a
woman
she
must
mean
mrs
thayer
she
said
you
sir
and
she
is
a
patient
i
asked
her
thinking
she
might
have
made
a
mistake
and
took
you
for
a
real
doctor
what
practices
she
said
she
did
want
doctoring
she
wanted
you
she
a
young
person
i
never
saw
before
sir
but
good
heavens
man
it
after
eleven
yes
sir
on
the
manservant
face
was
an
expression
of
lively
curiosity
and
disapproval
mingled
with
a
subdued
but
unholy
mirth
which
was
not
lost
on
the
doctor
and
which
particularly
exasperated
him
what
in
thunder
can
a
woman
with
a
baby
want
of
me
at
this
time
of
what
her
name
demanded
the
doctor
she
did
say
sir
well
go
ask
her
the
butler
coughed
slightly
but
made
no
move
to
leave
the
room
i
did
ask
her
sir
she
declined
to
give
it
declined
to
well
i
like
her
impertinence
yes
sir
she
said
you
the
servant
voice
faltered
and
swerved
ever
so
slightly
from
its
impassiveness
er
understand
sir
she
said
i
the
deuce
she
did
exploded
the
doctor
under
his
breath
flushing
an
angry
red
and
leaping
to
his
feet
did
you
tell
her
thayer
was
gone
he
demanded
at
last
wheeling
savagely
i
did
sir
and
well
she
said
she
was
glad
that
she
wanted
only
you
anyway
only
comes
here
at
this
time
of
night
with
a
bag
and
a
baby
refuses
to
give
her
name
and
says
i
understand
snarled
the
doctor
oh
come
hawkins
this
is
some
colossal
mistake
or
a
fool
hoax
or
what
kind
of
looking
specimen
is
she
hawkins
who
had
known
the
doctor
from
his
knickerbocker
days
was
guilty
of
a
slow
grin
she
a
a
very
good
looker
sir
oh
she
is
well
er
tell
her
i
ca
possibly
see
her
that
i
gone
to
bed
away
sick
something
anything
tell
her
she
have
to
see
mrs
thayer
yes
sir
still
the
man
made
no
move
to
go
she
er
beg
pardon
sir
but
she
be
that
cut
up
i
fear
sir
you
see
she
been
cryin
and
she
young
very
young
crying
yes
sir
and
she
was
that
powerful
anxious
to
see
you
sir
i
had
hard
work
to
keep
her
from
coming
me
i
did
sir
she
in
the
hall
and
it
raining
outside
sir
oh
good
heavens
well
bring
her
in
capitulated
the
doctor
in
obvious
desperation
yes
sir
this
time
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
before
the
old
man
was
gone
in
an
incredibly
short
time
he
was
back
with
a
agitated
young
woman
carrying
a
sleeping
child
in
her
arms
at
sight
of
her
the
doctor
who
had
plainly
braced
himself
behind
a
most
forbidding
aspect
leaped
forward
with
a
low
cry
and
a
complete
change
of
manner
denby
he
gasped
but
instantly
he
fell
back
for
the
young
woman
for
all
the
world
like
a
stage
heroine
hissed
out
a
tragic
i
do
want
anybody
to
know
my
name
with
a
cautious
glance
toward
the
disappearing
hawkins
but
what
does
this
mean
demanded
frank
gleason
when
he
could
find
words
where
burke
he
left
me
left
you
impossible
yes
she
drew
in
her
breath
convulsively
he
says
it
only
to
alaska
with
his
father
but
that
just
to
let
me
down
easy
oh
but
denby
you
need
try
to
make
me
think
any
different
she
interposed
wearily
sinking
into
the
chair
the
doctor
placed
for
her
you
ca
i
been
over
everything
you
could
say
all
the
way
down
here
i
did
have
anything
to
do
only
just
to
think
and
think
and
i
see
now
such
lots
of
things
that
i
never
saw
before
but
why
how
do
you
know
what
made
you
think
he
has
left
you
stammered
the
doctor
because
he
ashamed
of
me
and
oh
mrs
denby
you
do
have
to
say
anything
about
that
either
said
denby
very
quietly
and
before
the
dumb
agony
in
the
eyes
turned
full
upon
him
he
fell
silent
there
ai
any
question
as
to
what
been
done
it
just
what
to
she
went
on
wearily
again
he
sent
me
ten
thousand
dollars
burke
father
did
and
john
denby
sent
you
ten
thousand
dollars
exploded
the
doctor
sitting
erect
yes
a
check
i
got
it
here
he
sent
it
for
a
playday
you
know
nodded
denby
shifting
the
weight
of
the
heavy
baby
in
her
arms
and
and
that
why
i
came
to
you
to
to
me
stammered
the
doctor
growing
suddenly
alertly
miserable
and
nervous
again
a
a
playday
but
i
i
that
is
how
oh
i
not
going
to
take
the
playday
i
could
even
play
now
she
choked
it
then
in
a
breathless
burst
it
came
doctor
you
can
you
help
me
wo
you
to
learn
to
stand
and
walk
and
talk
and
eat
soup
and
wear
the
right
clothes
and
finger
nails
and
hair
you
know
and
not
say
the
wrong
things
and
everything
the
way
burke
friends
do
you
and
all
the
rest
of
them
know
so
can
be
swell
and
grand
too
and
he
wo
be
ashamed
of
me
and
ten
thousand
dollars
enough
to
pay
for
learning
all
that
from
sheer
inability
to
speak
the
man
could
only
fall
back
in
his
chair
and
stare
dumbly
please
do
look
at
me
like
that
besought
the
young
woman
frenziedly
it
just
as
if
you
said
you
help
me
but
you
can
i
know
you
can
and
i
can
it
i
know
that
too
i
read
it
in
a
book
once
about
a
girl
who
who
was
like
me
and
she
went
away
and
got
perfectly
grand
clothes
and
learning
and
all
and
then
she
came
back
and
he
he
did
know
her
at
first
her
husband
and
he
fell
in
love
with
her
all
over
again
and
she
did
have
near
so
much
money
as
got
doctor
you
help
me
the
doctor
with
his
shocked
amazed
eyes
on
the
piteously
pleading
face
opposite
threw
up
his
hands
in
despair
but
i
you
burke
oh
heavens
my
dear
lady
how
utterly
utterly
impossible
this
all
is
come

now
my
sister
at
the
beach
but
they
make
you
and

the
night
then
after
a
good
sleep
we
we
fix
it
all
up
i
get
burke
on
the
long
distance
and
gleason
interrupted
helen
denby
with
a
calmness
that
would
have
deceived
him
had
he
not
seen
her
eyes
my
husband
is
worrying
about

door
and
neither
you
nor
him

anybody

protested
the
doctor
again
helplessly
once
more
helen
interrupted
doctor
why
ca
you
be
straight
with
me
she
pleaded
i
had
to
come
to
you
there
was
anybody
else
i

to
and
there
is
any
other
way
out
of
it
but
this
i
tell
you
i
been
doing
some
all
the
way
down
here
it

just
think
think
think
the
doctor
wet
his
lips
but
if
if
burke
knew
look
cut
in
helen
resolutely
you

to
our
house
quite
a
lot
since
burke
and
me

think
i
made
burke
real
happy

you
there
was
no
answer
you
might
just
as
well
say
the
words
with
your
lips
doctor
your
face

said
them
observed
helen
a
little
dryly
well

you
besides

the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
sorry

and
by

a
little
girl
and
then
a
young
lady
and
she
was
so
sweet
and
pretty
and
and
i
her
so
and
i
got
to
thinking
how
i
feel
if
somebody
took
her
away
from
me
the
way
i
took
burke
away
from
his
father
and
married
her
when
i
want
her
to
any
more
burke
father
wanted
to
and
i
i
could
see

how
he
must
have
felt
worshiping
burke
as
he
did
i
know
i
used
to
see
them
together
when
i
was
nurse
there
with
children
i
never
saw
a
father
and
son
so
much
like
chums
he
doted
on
burke
i

he
felt
and
and
it

out
the
way
he
said

the
one
for
burke
at
all
i
i
dragged
him
down
denby
please
begged
the
doctor
but
she
paused
only
long
enough
to
shake
her
head
yes
i
have
i
know
i
been
thinking
it
all
over
the
life
we
led
together
and
what
he
might
have
had
if
he
had
had
if
it
been
for
me
and
that
why
now
i
want
to
see
if

of
me

for
me
only
it
for
dorothy
elizabeth
i
want
to
teach
her
it
bad
enough
to
have
him
ashamed
of
me
but

i
just
could
stand
it
if
he

ashamed
of
and

me
please

me
at
home
now
so
i
not
displeasing
him

the
doctor
sprang
to
his
feet
his
eyes
were
moist
and
his
voice
shook
when
he
spoke

help
you
to
to
bring
down
the
moon

all
the
stars

frank
gleason
had
a
plan
of
a
sort
ready
by
morning
he
told
it
at
the
breakfast
table
i
going
to
take
you
to
my
sister
provided
of
course
that
you
agree
he
announced
five
minutes
talk
with
her
on
this
matter
will
be
worth
five
years
with
me
i
should
wonder
if
she
kept
you
herself
for
a
time
with
her
and
you
could
be
in
a
better
place
perhaps
you
be
willing
to
help
her
with
the
children
and
she
be
glad
of
that
i
know
but
my
money
ca
i
pay
money
faltered
helen
he
shook
his
head
not
if
we
can
help
it
your
money
you
need
later
for
miss
dorothy
unless
you
are
willing
to
make
yourself
known
to
your
husband
sooner
than
you
seem
now
to
be
willing
to
we
invest
it
in
something
safe
and
solid
and
it
bring
you
in
a
few
hundred
a
year
you
have
that
to
spend
and
that
will
go
quite
a
way
under
some
circumstances
but
i
i
want
to
to
learn
things
you
know
stammered
helen
how
to
be
be
you
learn
lots
of
things
if
you
live
with
my
sister
remarked
the
doctor
significantly
oh
smiled
helen
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
content
the
doctor
sighed
too
though
not
at
all
with
either
relief
or
content
to
the
doctor
the
task
before
him
loomed
as
absurd
and
unreal
as
if
it
were
indeed
the
of
the
stars
and
the
moon
the
of
his
extravagant
promise
of
the
night
before
chapter
xii
the
trail
of
the
ink
burke
denby
was
well
pleased
with
the
letter
that
he
had
sent
to
his
wife
enclosing
the
check
he
felt
that
it
was
both
conclusive
and
diplomatic
and
he
believed
that
it
carried
a
frankness
that
would
prove
to
be
disarming
he
had
every
confidence
that
helen
would
eventually
if
not
at
once
recognize
its
logic
and
reasonableness
and
follow
its
suggestions
with
a
light
heart
therefore
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
day
with
his
father
by
saturday
however
a
lively
curiosity
began
to
assail
him
as
to
just
how
helen
did
take
the
note
after
all
there
also
came
unpleasantly
to
him
a
recurrence
of
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
his
abrupt
departure
from
home
thursday
night
had
been
neither
brave
nor
kind
and
in
fact
hardly
decent
under
the
circumstances
he
decided
that
he
would
when
he
saw
helen
really
quite
humble
himself
and
apologize
roundly
it
was
no
more
than
her
due
poor
girl
by
sunday
between
his
curiosity
and
his
uneasy
remorse
he
was
too
nervous
really
to
enjoy
anything
to
the
full
but
he
sternly
adhered
to
his
original
plan
of
not
going
down
to
the
dale
street
flat
before
monday
believing
in
his
heart
that
nothing
could
do
so
much
good
to
both
of
them
under
the
circumstances
as
a
few
days
of
thought
apart
from
each
other
monday
however
found
him
headed
for
dale
street
but
in
an
hour
he
was
back
at
elm
hill
he
was
plainly
very
angry
she
gone
he
announced
with
a
brevity
more
eloquent
of
his
state
of
mind
than
a
flood
of
words
would
have
been
gone
where
home
to
spend
that
ten
thousand
dollars
of
course
she
left
this
with
a
frown
john
denby
took
the
proffered
bit
of
paper
upon
which
had
been
scrawled
i
hope
you
enjoy
your
playday
as
much
as
i
shall
mine
address
me
at
wenton
if
you
care
to
write
helen
where
did
you
find
this
on
my
chiffonier
i
did
think
that
of
helen
and
there
was
nothing
to
show
she
left
nothing
except
that
the
apartment
was
in
order
from
end
to
end
and
must
have
taken
time
to
accomplish
but
perhaps
the
neighbors
would
there
no
one
she
knows
but
cobb
interrupted
burke
with
an
impatient
gesture
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
her
and
whimper
wife
gone
please
do
you
know
when
she
went
not
much
i
saw
her
the
dear
creature
and
one
glance
at
her
face
showed
that
she
was
dying
to
be
asked
but
i
did
afford
her
that
satisfaction
i
gave
her
a
particularly
blithe
and
then
walked
away
as
if
i
was
coming
home
to
an
empty
house
all
the
time
but
i
repeat
i
disappointed
i
did
think
this
of
helen
running
off
like
this
you
think
she
was
angry
then
at
your
letter
of
course
she
was
at
that
and
at
the
way
i
left
her
the
other
night
i
a
bit
of
a
cad
there
i
admit
but
that
does
excuse
her
for
doing
a
trick
like
this
i
wrote
her
a
good
letter
and
you
sent
her
a
very
generous
check
and
i
told
her
i
was
coming
to
pick
up
my
traps
and
say
she
did
care
to
see
me
that
all
but
she
might
have
had
some
thought
that
i
like
to
see
my
daughter
before
i
go
if
there
was
time
i
run
up
there
but
it
out
of
the
question
with
only
before
we
start
wenton
is
her
home
town
i
suppose
yes
she
left
there
you
know
two
years
before
i
saw
her
her
father
died
and
then
her
mother
and
she
had
to
look
out
for
herself
i
shall
write
of
course
and
send
it
up
before
i
go
and
i
shall
try
to
write
decently
but
i
will
own
up
father
i
mad
clear
through
too
bad
too
bad
john
denby
frowned
and
shook
his
head
again
i
must
confess
burke
that
i
too
did
quite
think
this
of
helen
i
do
know
her
street
address
of
course
burke
was
on
his
feet
pacing
back
and
forth
but
that
is
necessary
it
a
small
town
i
know
that
i
told
her
i
thought
she
like
the
hotel
best
but
she
may
prefer
to
go
to
some
friend
home
however
that
does
signify
she
get
it
all
right
if
i
direct
it
simply
to
wenton
but
i
have
a
reply
before
i
leave
there
is
time
even
if
she
deigned
to
write
which
i
doubt
in
her
present
evident
frame
of
mind
pleasant
is
it
makes
me
feel
real
happy
to
start
off
with
no
of
course
it
does
admitted
john
denby
with
a
sigh
but
come
burke
his
eyes
grew
wistful
do
let
this
silly
whim
of
helen
spoil
everything
fretting
never
did
help
anything
and
perhaps
after
all
it
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
a
meeting
between
you
in
helen
present
temper
could
have
resulted
only
in
unhappiness
obviously
helen
is
piqued
and
angry
at
your
suggesting
a
separation
for
a
time
she
determined
to
give
it
to
you
but
to
give
it
to
you
a
little
sooner
than
you
wanted
that
her
way
of
getting
back
at
you
that
all
let
her
alone
she
come
to
her
senses
in
time
oh
of
course
he
hastened
to
add
in
answer
to
the
expression
on
his
son
face
but
do
expect
a
reply
too
soon
you
must
remember
you
gave
helen
a
pretty
big
blow
to
her
pride
i
she
had
looked
at
the
matter
sensibly
of
course
but
probably
that
was
too
much
to
expect
i
afraid
it
was
of
biting
his
lips
burke
pulled
himself
up
sharply
i
go
and
write
my
letter
he
finished
wearily
instead
and
john
denby
echoed
the
long
sigh
he
drew
it
was
january
when
john
denby
and
his
son
returned
from
their
alaskan
trip
the
long
and
rather
serious
illness
of
john
denby
in
november
and
the
necessary
slowness
of
their
journeying
thereafter
had
caused
a
series
of
delays
very
trying
to
both
father
and
son
to
neither
john
denby
nor
burke
had
the
trip
been
an
entire
success
burke
in
spite
of
his
joy
at
being
with
his
father
and
his
delight
in
the
traveling
itself
could
not
get
away
from
the
shadow
of
an
upturned
bottle
of
ink
in
a
dale
street
flat
at
times
with
all
the
old
boyish
enthusiasm
and
lightness
of
heart
he
entered
into
whatever
came
but
underneath
it
all
and
forever
cropping
uppermost
was
a
surge
of
anger
a
bitterness
of
heart
not
once
through
the
entire
trip
had
burke
heard
from
his
wife
their
mail
of
course
had
been
infrequent
and
irregular
but
from
time
to
time
a
batch
of
letters
would
be
found
waiting
for
them
and
always
with
feverish
eagerness
burke
had
scanned
the
envelopes
for
a
sight
of
helen
familiar
scrawl
he
had
never
found
it
and
he
was
very
angry
thereat
he
was
not
worried
or
frightened
any
denby
of
the
dalton
denbys
was
too
well
known
not
to
have
any
vital
information
concerning
him
or
her
communicated
to
the
family
headquarters
if
anything
had
happened
to
either
helen
or
the
child
he
would
have
known
of
it
of
course
through
brett
this
silence
could
mean
therefore
but
one
thing
helen
own
wish
that
he
should
not
hear
he
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
angry
he
pictured
helen
happy
gay
in
her
new
finery
queening
it
over
her
old
school
friends
in
wenton
and
nursing
wrath
and
resentment
against
himself
else
why
did
she
not
write
and
the
picture
did
not
please
him
he
had
suggested
separation
for
a
time
to
be
sure
but
he
had
not
suggested
total
annihilation
of
all
intercourse
if
she
did
not
care
to
say
anything
for
herself
she
might
at
least
be
decent
enough
to
let
him
hear
as
to
the
welfare
of
his
child
he
reasoned
indignantly
on
one
course
of
action
he
was
determined
as
soon
as
he
returned
home
he
would
go
to
helen
and
have
it
out
with
her
if
she
to
carry
to
such
absurd
lengths
her
unreasonable
pique
at
his
perfectly
reasonable
suggestion
he
wanted
to
know
it
at
once
and
not
live
along
this
way
under
these
circumstances
it
is
not
strange
perhaps
that
the
trip
for
burke
was
not
an
unalloyed
joy
and
the
delays
in
addition
to
giving
him
no
little
anxiety
for
his
father
fretted
him
almost
beyond
endurance
as
to
john
denby
he
too
could
not
get
away
from
the
shadow
of
an
upturned
bottle
of
ink
besides
suffering
the
reflection
of
its
effect
on
his
son
in
that
son
moodiness
and
frequent
lack
of
enthusiasm
he
had
no
small
amount
of
it
on
his
own
account
burke
of
that
evening
catastrophe
had
been
a
vivid
one
and
john
denby
could
not
forget
it
he
realized
that
it
meant
much
in
many
ways
the
fact
that
it
had
been
followed
by
helen
ominous
silence
did
not
lessen
his
uneasy
questionings
he
wondered
if
after
all
he
had
done
the
wise
thing
in
bringing
about
this
temporary
separation
he
still
believed
in
his
heart
that
he
had
but
he
did
not
seem
to
find
much
happiness
in
that
belief
in
spite
of
his
supreme
joy
and
content
in
his
son
companionship
he
found
himself
many
a
time
almost
wishing
the
trip
were
over
and
the
delays
at
the
end
were
fully
as
great
a
source
of
annoyance
to
himself
as
they
were
to
his
son
he
as
well
as
burke
therefore
heaved
a
long
sigh
of
relief
as
the
train
drew
into
the
dalton
station
bringing
into
view
the
old
denby
family
carriage
john
denby
did
not
care
for
motor
cars
with
old
horace
on
the
box
and
with
brett
near
by
plainly
waiting
to
extend
a
welcoming
hand
brett
face
was
white
and
a
little
john
denby
noticing
it
through
the
car
window
remarked
to
his
son
guess
brett
will
be
glad
to
see
us
he
looks
tired
overworked
i
fear
faithful
fellow
that
burke
we
owe
him
our
trip
anyway
but
who
supposed
it
was
going
to
prolong
itself
away
into
january
like
this
who
did
indeed
murmured
burke
as
he
followed
his
father
from
the
car
burke
denby
had
not
been
at
home
half
an
hour
when
his
face
drawn
and
ashen
he
strode
into
the
library
where
his
father
was
sitting
before
the
fire
father
helen
has
not
been
at
wenton
at
all
he
said
in
the
tragically
constrained
voice
of
a
man
who
is
desperately
trying
to
keep
himself
from
exploding
into
ravings
and
denunciations
john
denby
came
erect
in
his
chair
been
what
do
you
mean
how
do
you
know
brett
i
found
these
upstairs
in
my
room
letter
i
written
even
the
first
one
from
here
before
i
left
returned
unopened
marked
address
unknown
together
with
a
letter
from
brett
in
explanation
i
just
been
talking
with
him
on
the
too
so
that
it
why
he
looked
so
at
the
station
what
did
he
say
why
did
he
let
you
know
before
he
says
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
first
letter
came
back
he
knew
we
were
away
up
in
the
mountains
and
would
be
very
likely
started
for
home
before
he
could
reach
us
with
it
anyway
and
there
would
be
a
thing
we
could
do
up
there
except
to
come
home
and
we
already
be
doing
that
anyway
and
this
would
only
worry
us
and
trouble
us
and
make
our
return
trip
a
horror
without
helping
a
bit
quite
right
brett
is
always
right
nodded
john
denby
then
of
course
came
the
delay
your
sickness
and
all
of
course
he
would
let
us
know
then
when
we
come
by
that
time
other
letters
i
had
written
on
the
way
out
began
to
come
back
from
wenton
i
always
used
my
own
envelopes
with
the
dalton
address
in
the
corner
so
of
course
they
all
showed
up
here
in
time
when
the
second
and
third
came
he
knew
it
was
a
mistake
he
been
hoping
the
first
one
was
somehow
he
said
yes
yes
i
see
and
of
course
it
might
have
been
but
what
did
he
do
did
he
do
anything
yes
first
he
said
he
kept
his
own
counsel
here
in
town
he
knew
we
want
to
avoid
all
gossip
and
publicity
of
course
he
put
the
thing
into
the
hands
of
a
private
detective
whom
he
could
trust
and
he
went
himself
to
wenton
for
a
vacation
apparently
good
old
brett
wise
as
usual
what
did
he
find
nothing
except
that
she
was
not
there
and
had
been
there
since
she
left
some
years
ago
soon
after
her
mother
death
he
says
positive
of
that
so
he
had
to
come
back
no
wiser
than
he
went
but
the
detective
very
little
there
still
there
was
something
he
traced
her
to
boston
yes
what
friends
has
she
in
boston
none
so
far
as
i
know
i
never
heard
her
mention
knowing
a
soul
there
still
i
believe
she
had
a
a
position
there
with
some
one
before
she
went
to
aunt
eunice
but
i
do
know
who
it
was
there
gleason
she
knows
him
burke
gave
his
father
a
glance
from
scornful
eyes
my
best
friend
she
be
apt
to
go
to
him
would
she
if
she
were
running
away
from
me
besides
we
had
three
or
four
letters
from
him
since
we
been
gone
do
you
suppose
he
tell
us
of
it
if
gone
to
him
yes
yes
of
course
frowned
john
denby
biting
his
lips
it
only
that
i
was
trying
to
get
hold
of
some
one
or
something
think
of
it
that
child
alone
in
boston
and
no
friends
of
course
she
had
money
that
is
i
suppose
she
cashed
it
that
check
john
denby
turned
with
a
start
oh
yes
i
asked
brett
about
that
i
hoped
maybe
there
be
a
clue
there
if
she
got
somebody
to
cash
it
for
her
but
there
was
nothing
she
got
the
money
herself
at
the
bank
here
not
long
after
we
went
so
she
must
have
come
back
for
a
time
anyway
brett
says
spawlding
at
the
bank
knew
her
of
course
and
so
there
was
no
question
as
to
identification
still
it
was
so
large
a
one
that
he
telephoned
to
brett
before
he
paid
it
asking
if
it
were
all
right
you
being
away
brett
evidently
knew
you
had
given
her
such
a
check
yes
i
had
told
him
nodded
john
denby
so
he
said
yes
it
was
he
says
he
supposed
she
had
come
down
from
wenton
to
get
it
cashed
and
that
she
would
leave
the
bulk
of
it
there
in
the
bank
to
her
credit
anyway
all
he
could
do
was
to
assure
spawlding
that
you
had
given
her
such
a
check
just
before
you
went
away
yes
yes
i
see
nodded
john
denby
again
she
did
leave
any
of
the
money
however
she
took
it
all
with
her
took
it
ten
thousand
dollars
yes
the
detective
of
course
is
still
working
on
the
case
he
got
to
boston
but
there
he
up
against
a
blank
wall
he
run
a
comb
through
all
sorts
of
public
and
private
institutions
in
boston
and
vicinity
without
avail
he
made
a
thorough
search
at
the
railroad
station
he
ca
find
a
person
who
has
any
recollection
of
a
young
woman
and
child
answering
their
description
arriving
on
that
date
who
seemed
to
be
troubled
or
in
doubt
where
to
go
he
questioned
the
matron
cabbies
policemen
everybody
of
course
every
one
had
seen
plenty
of
young
women
with
babies
in
their
arms
young
women
who
had
the
hair
and
eyes
and
general
appearance
of
helen
and
who
were
anxious
and
fretted
they
said
young
women
with
babies
were
apt
to
be
anxious
and
fretted
but
they
did
remember
one
who
asked
frantic
questions
as
to
what
to
do
and
where
to
go
and
all
that
acting
as
we
think
helen
would
have
acted
alone
in
a
strange
city
poor
child
poor
child
groaned
john
denby
where
can
but
his
son
interrupted
sternly
i
do
where
she
is
of
course
but
do
be
too
sure
it
is
child
with
her
dad
she
doing
this
thing
because
she
to
do
it
do
forget
that
did
she
purposely
mislead
us
by
that
note
she
left
on
my
chiffonier
she
did
say
she
gone
to
wenton
but
she
let
me
think
she
had
me
at
wenton
if
you
care
to
write
she
said
and
do
forget
that
she
also
said
hope
enjoy
your
playday
as
much
as
i
shall
mine
do
you
worry
about
helen
she
taken
my
child
and
your
ten
thousand
dollars
and
she
off
somewhere
having
a
good
time
and
helen
could
have
a
good
time
on
ten
thousand
dollars
incidentally
she
also
punishing
us
she
means
to
give
us
a
good
scare
she
waiting
till
we
get
home
and
till
the
money
gone
then
she
let
herself
be
found
oh
come
come
burke
are
you
just
a
little
bit
harsh
remonstrated
john
denby
i
do
think
so
she
deserves
something
for
taking
that
child
away
like
this
honestly
as
my
temper
is
now
if
it
was
for
the
baby
i
should
feel
almost
like
saying
that
i
hoped
she
would
ever
come
back
i
do
want
to
see
her
but
of
course
with
the
baby
that
another
matter
i
should
say
so
exclaimed
john
denby
emphatically
yes
but
see
here
dad
helen
knew
where
she
was
going
she
gone
to
friends
would
she
have
left
some
trace
in
that
station
if
she
been
frightened
and
uncertain
where
to
go
brett
says
the
detective
found
one
cabby
who
remembered
taking
just
such
a
young
woman
and
child
from
an
evening
train
at
about
that
time
he
did
recollect
where
he
took
her
and
he
could
say
as
to
whether
she
had
been
crying
or
not
but
positive
she
directed
him
where
to
go
without
a
moment
hesitation
if
that
was
helen
she
knew
where
she
was
going
all
right
john
denby
frowned
and
did
not
answer
his
eyes
were
troubled
but
perhaps
here
at
the
flat
he
began
after
a
time
the
detective
tried
that
he
went
as
a
student
or
something
and
managed
to
hire
a
room
of
cobb
he
became
very
friendly
and
chatty
and
showed
interest
in
all
the
neighbors
not
forgetting
the
vacant
flat
on
the
same
floor
but
he
did
learn
much
but
he
learned
something
an
angry
red
mounted
to
burke
forehead
oh
yes
he
learned
that
it
belonged
to
a
poor
little
woman
whose
husband
was
as
rich
as
mud
but
quite
the
meanest
thing
alive
in
that
he
tried
to
buy
her
off
with
ten
thousand
dollars
because
he
was
ashamed
of
her
just
about
what
i
should
think
would
come
from
a
woman
of
cobb
mentality
then
she
knew
about
the
check
apparently
but
she
did
know
helen
had
gone
to
boston
the
detective
found
out
that
she
told
him
she
believed
she
gone
back
home
to
her
folks
so
helen
evidently
did
not
confide
in
her
or
perhaps
she
intentionally
misled
her
as
she
did
us
i
see
i
see
sighed
john
denby
for
a
minute
the
angry
perplexed
baffled
young
husband
marched
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
in
the
great
silent
room
then
abruptly
he
stopped
short
and
faced
his
father
i
shall
try
to
find
her
of
course
though
i
think
she
let
us
hear
from
her
of
her
own
accord
pretty
soon
now
but
i
sha
wait
for
that
first
i
shall
go
to
aunt
eunice
and
see
if
she
knows
the
names
of
any
of
the
people
with
whom
helen
used
to
live
before
she
came
to
her
then
whatever
clues
i
find
i
shall
endeavor
to
follow
to
the
end
meanwhile
so
far
as
dalton
is
concerned
wife
is
out
of
that
all
it
no
one
business
the
matter
will
be
hauled
over
every
and
rolled
under
the
tongue
of
every
old
tabby
in
town
but
they
can
only
surmise
and
suspect
they
ca
know
anything
about
it
and
we
be
mighty
careful
that
they
do
brett
bless
him
has
been
the
soul
of
discretion
we
see
that
we
follow
suit
wife
is
out
of
town
that
all
and
he
turned
and
flung
himself
from
the
room
as
soon
as
possible
burke
denby
went
to
his
aunt
eunice
and
told
her
his
sorry
tale
from
her
he
obtained
one
or
two
names
and
what
he
eagerly
grasped
at
an
address
in
boston
each
of
these
clues
he
followed
assiduously
only
to
find
that
it
led
nowhere
angrier
but
no
wiser
he
went
back
home
the
detective
too
reported
no
progress
and
as
the
days
became
weeks
and
the
weeks
a
month
with
no
word
of
helen
burke
settled
into
a
bitterness
of
wrath
and
resentment
that
would
not
brook
the
mention
of
helen
name
in
his
presence
burke
was
feeling
very
much
abused
these
days
he
was
indeed
thinking
of
himself
and
pitying
himself
almost
constantly
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
given
his
name
and
for
whom
he
had
sacrificed
so
much
had
made
that
name
a
byword
and
a
laughing
stock
in
his
native
town
he
was
neither
bachelor
nor
husband
he
was
not
even
a
widower
but
a
nondescript
thing
to
be
pointed
out
as
a
sort
of
monster
even
his
child
was
taken
away
from
him
and
was
doubtless
being
brought
up
to
hate
him
burke
forgot
that
dorothy
elizabeth
was
as
yet
but
slightly
over
two
years
old
as
for
helen
side
of
the
matter
burke
was
too
busy
polishing
his
own
shield
of
defense
to
give
any
consideration
to
hers
when
he
thought
of
his
wife
it
was
usually
only
to
say
bitterly
to
himself
humph
when
that
ten
thousand
dollars
is
gone
we
hear
from
her
all
right
and
he
was
not
worrying
at
all
about
her
comfort
with
ten
thousand
dollars
to
spend
she
knows
where
is
and
she
knows
where
am
he
would
declare
fiercely
to
himself
when
she
gets
good
and
ready
she
come
and
not
until
then
evidently
in
march
a
line
from
gleason
said
that
he
would
be
in
town
a
day
or
two
and
would
drop
in
to
see
them
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
burke
went
to
his
father
gleason
coming
friday
he
announced
tersely
well
we
got
to
settle
on
what
to
tell
him
about
helen
yes
of
course
he
have
to
know
something
but
i
shall
tell
him
mighty
little
burke
lips
snapped
together
in
the
grim
manner
that
was
becoming
habitual
with
him
gleason
came
on
friday
there
was
an
odd
constraint
in
his
manner
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
nervous
wistfulness
that
was
almost
an
appeal
yet
he
was
making
obviously
a
great
effort
to
appear
as
usual
not
until
burke
found
himself
alone
with
his
guest
did
he
speak
of
his
wife
then
he
said
you
know
of
course
that
helen
has
er
that
she
is
not
here
yes
there
was
a
subdued
excitement
in
the
doctor
voice
of
course
everybody
knows
that
i
suppose
retorted
burke
bitterly
he
hesitated
then
went
on
with
manifest
effort
if
you
do
mind
old
fellow
we
leave
it
right
there
there
really
nothing
that
i
care
to
say
a
look
of
keen
disappointment
crossed
the
doctor
face
but
burke
if
you
knew
that
your
wife
began
the
doctor
imploringly
there
are
no
about
it
interrupted
burke
with
stern
implacability
helen
knows
very
well
where
i
am
and
she
is
here
that
enough
for
me
but
my
dear
boy
pleaded
the
doctor
again
gleason
please
i
rather
not
talk
about
it
interrupted
burke
denby
decidedly
and
the
doctor
in
the
face
of
the
stern
uncompromisingness
of
the
man
before
him
and
of
his
own
solemn
but
promise
given
to
a
no
less
uncompromising
little
woman
whom
he
had
left
only
the
day
before
was
forced
to
drop
the
matter
his
face
however
still
carried
its
look
of
troubled
disappointment
and
he
steadfastly
refused
to
remain
at
the
house
even
for
a
meal
a
most
extraordinary
proceeding
for
him
he
angry
and
he
angry
with
me
muttered
burke
denby
to
himself
his
eyes
moodily
fixed
on
the
doctor
hurrying
figure
as
it
disappeared
down
the
street
he
wanted
to
preach
and
plead
and
tell
me
my
as
if
i
did
know
my
own
business
best
myself
bah
a
fig
for
his
and
chapter
xiii
a
woman
two
days
after
his
visit
to
dalton
frank
gleason
dropped
himself
into
a
low
chair
in
his
sister
private
in
the
beacon
hill
house
well
prompted
thayer
voice
and
manner
impatiently
eager
nothing
nothing
but
there
must
have
been
something
there
was
a
thing
that
will
help
but
are
they
frightened
anxious
anything
do
they
where
she
is
oh
yes
they
care
very
much
smiled
the
doctor
wearily
but
not
in
the
way
that
is
going
to
help
any
i
could
get
out
of
burke
and
i
did
get
much
more
out
of
his
father
but
i
did
a
little
they
do
know
of
course
that
she
here
heavens
i
hope
not
under
the
circumstances
but
i
felt
all
kinds
of
a
knave
and
a
fool
and
a
traitor
i
got
away
as
soon
as
possible
i
could
stay
i
hoped
to
get
something
anything
that
i
could
use
for
a
cudgel
over
helen
to
get
her
to
go
back
you
know
but
i
could
get
a
thing
however
i
shall
keep
on
urging
of
course
but
what
they
say
burke
said
nothing
practically
nor
would
he
let
me
say
anything
he
is
very
angry
his
father
told
me
that
and
very
bitter
but
is
he
frightened
or
worried
not
according
to
his
father
it
seems
they
have
had
a
detective
on
the
case
and
have
traced
her
to
boston
there
the
trail
ends
but
they
have
found
out
enough
to
feel
satisfied
that
no
evil
has
befallen
her
burke
argues
that
helen
is
staying
somewhere
with
friends
he
believes
because
she
wants
to
such
being
the
case
he
does
want
her
back
until
she
gets
good
and
ready
to
come
he
does
want
the
baby
john
denby
told
me
in
fact
that
he
believed
if
burke
found
them
now
as
he
feeling
he
insist
on
a
separation
and
that
the
baby
should
be
given
to
him
given
to
him
indeed
flashed
thayer
angrily
and
yet
in
the
face
of
that
you
sit
there
and
say
you
shall
urge
her
to
go
back
of
course
frank
gleason
stirred
uneasily
i
know
edith
but
there
is
any
question
about
it
interrupted
thayer
decidedly
that
poor
child
stays
where
she
is
now
oh
but
edith
this
sort
of
thing
ca
go
on
forever
you
know
remonstrated
the
doctor
nervously
his
forehead
drawn
into
an
anxious
frown
i
was
talking
about
forever
returned
the
lady
with
tranquil
confidence
i
was
talking
about
next
week
next
year
if
it
necessary
year
certainly
if
burke
denby
has
come
to
his
senses
by
that
time
why
frank
gleason
do
you
suppose
i
do
anything
to
help
that
child
keep
her
baby
she
worships
it
besides
it
going
to
be
the
making
of
her
i
know
but
if
they
could
be
brought
together
burke
and
his
wife
i
mean
it
seems
as
if
as
if
the
man
came
to
a
helpless
pause
frank
see
here
began
edith
thayer
resolutely
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
those
two
people
have
been
wretched
together
for
a
year
or
more
they
are
not
suited
to
each
other
they
were
in
the
first
place
to
make
matters
worse
they
were
both
nothing
but
petted
spoiled
children
no
more
fit
to
take
on
the
responsibilities
of
marriage
than
my
bess
and
charlie
would
be
all
their
lives
they
had
their
own
dolls
and
shotguns
to
do
as
they
pleased
with
and
when
it
came
to
marrying
and
sharing
everything
including
their
time
and
their
tempers
they
flew
into
bits
both
of
them
yes
i
know
sighed
the
man
still
with
a
troubled
frown
well
they
apart
now
never
mind
who
was
to
blame
for
it
or
whether
it
was
or
was
a
wise
move
it
done
they
apart
they
got
a
chance
to
think
things
over
to
stand
back
and
get
a
perspective
as
it
were
helen
thinks
she
can
metamorphose
herself
into
the
perfect
wife
that
burke
will
love
perhaps
she
can
let
us
say
she
has
one
chance
in
a
million
of
doing
so
well
i
mean
she
shall
have
that
chance
especially
as
the
alternative
that
is
her
going
back
home
now
is
sure
to
be
nothing
but
utter
wretchedness
all
round
frank
gleason
shook
his
head
yes
yes
very
plausible
to
of
course
i
see
she
talked
you
over
she
did
me
i
was
ready
to
pull
the
moon
down
for
her
footstool
that
first
night
she
came
to
me
i
ready
to
do
it
now
when
i
with
her
but
away
from
her
with
a
chance
to
think
it
really
is
absurd
you
know
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
here
are
burke
and
his
father
my
good
friends
hunting
the
country
over
for
burke
wife
and
child
and
here
am
i
harboring
her
and
abetting
her
and
never
opening
my
head
really
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
say
er
happen
you
know
but
it
happening
and
so
far
as
their
finding
her
is
concerned
you
said
yourself
long
ago
that
it
was
the
safest
in
the
world
for
they
never
think
of
looking
in
it
they
never
been
in
the
habit
of
coming
here
and
their
friends
do
know
us
as
for
the
servants
and
the
few
of
my
friends
who
see
her
she
merely
mrs
darling
that
all
besides
you
entirely
leaving
out
of
consideration
helen
own
attitude
in
the
matter
i
have
a
doubt
but
that
if
you
did
tell
she
at
least
to
carry
out
her
crazy
threats
of
flight
and
oblivion
really
frank
so
far
as
being
a
friend
is
concerned
you
being
the
truest
friend
both
to
burke
and
his
father
and
to
helen
by
keeping
her
and
protecting
her
from
herself
and
others
to
say
nothing
of
the
real
help
i
hope
i
being
to
her
i
know
i
know
sighed
the
man
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
scowling
at
the
toe
of
his
shoe
you
a
brick
edith
it
been
simply
marvelous
to
me
the
way
you
taken
hold
even
that
first
awful
sunday
morning
last
july
when
i
showed
you
what
i
brought
you
quite
bowl
you
over
it
did
almost
laughed
edith
especially
when
she
blurted
out
that
alarming
speech
after
you
told
me
who
she
was
what
she
say
i
do
remember
she
said
tragically
frenziedly
thayer
you
will
help
me
wo
you
to
be
swell
and
grand
and
things
so
burke
wo
be
ashamed
of
me
and
if
you
ca
make
so
you
will
baby
wo
you
i
do
anything
everything
you
say
oh
please
say
you
will
i
you
burke
kind
of
folks
just
to
look
at
you
and
at
this
the
house
and
all
these
swell
fixings
you
will
wo
you
oh
please
say
you
will
gorry
did
she
say
that
all
that
every
bit
of
it
and
more
that
i
ca
remember
you
see
i
say
anything
not
anything
for
a
minute
and
the
more
she
said
the
less
i
say
probably
she
saw
something
of
the
horror
and
dismay
in
my
face
and
that
what
made
her
so
frenzied
in
her
appeal
no
wonder
you
were
struck
dumb
at
her
nerve
and
at
mine
in
asking
you
to
take
her
in
laughed
the
doctor
softly
oh
but
was
for
only
a
minute
i
capitulated
at
once
first
because
of
the
baby
she
was
such
a
dear
then
because
of
the
mother
love
for
it
i
thought
i
seen
devotion
frank
but
never
have
i
seen
it
like
hers
how
is
she
doing
really
about
well
er
this
private
association
of
hers
the
doctor
smile
was
eager
and
quizzical
i
been
away
so
much
and
i
seen
so
little
of
her
for
months
past
how
she
doing
splendidly
she
a
daily
marvel
to
me
she
so
patient
and
painstaking
oh
of
course
she
has
so
very
much
yet
but
she
so
alert
and
earnest
and
she
watches
everything
so
indeed
if
it
were
really
so
pitiful
and
so
tragic
it
would
be
perfectly
funny
and
absurd
the
things
she
does
and
says
the
things
she
asks
me
to
teach
her
feverishly
and
systematically
she
set
herself
to
becoming
and
swell
grand
oh
yes
i
know
laughed
the
lady
answering
his
shuddering
words
and
gesture
and
we
nearly
eliminated
those
expressions
from
our
vocabulary
now
burke
did
like
them
either
she
says
i
can
imagine
not
observed
the
doctor
dryly
of
course
all
the
teaching
in
the
world
is
going
to
accomplish
the
thing
she
wants
went
on
thayer
a
little
soberly
i
might
teach
her
till
doomsday
that
clothes
jewels
grooming
and
perfume
make
the
lady
and
unless
she
learns
by
intuition
and
absorption
what
make
the
lady
she
be
little
better
off
than
she
was
before
but
she
puts
me
now
through
a
daily
catechism
until
sometimes
i
am
nearly
wild
ladies
do
this
ladies
do
that
she
queries
at
every
turn
so
that
i
am
almost
ready
to
fly
off
into
a
veritable
orgy
of
slang
and
silliness
just
from
sheer
contrariety
i
can
tell
you
frank
this
attempting
to
teach
the
intangible
evanescent
thing
trying
to
teach
helen
denby
is
very
easy
if
you
think
it
is
you
try
it
yourself
heaven
forbid
shrugged
the
man
but
i
risk
you
edith
but
tell
me
does
she
help
you
any
in
any
way
do
you
think
you
can
keep
her
for
a
while
keep
her
of
course
i
shall
keep
her
do
you
suppose
i
turn
that
child
adrift
now
besides
she
a
real
help
to
me
with
the
children
and
i
know
and
she
knows
that
in
helping
me
she
is
helping
herself
and
helping
dorothy
elizabeth
she
calls
her
now
we
getting
along
beautifully
we
there
came
the
sound
of
hurried
steps
then
the
sudden
wide
flinging
of
the
door
and
the
appearance
of
a
breathless
young
woman
oh
thayer
they
said
the
doctor
had
come
and
helen
denby
stopped
short
her
abashed
eyes
going
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
expressive
faces
before
her
oh
i
i
beg
your
pardon
she
faltered
i
had
ought
to
have
burst
in
like
this
ladies
do
you
said
yesterday
that
ladies
never
did
but
i
i
doctor
you
went
to
to
dalton
she
appealed
to
the
man
yes
mrs
denby
and
you
saw
them
burke
and
his
father
yes
but
you
did
you
tell
them
i
was
here
of
course
not
did
i
promise
you
i
would
helen
denby
relaxed
visibly
and
dropped
herself
into
a
low
chair
near
by
the
color
came
back
to
her
face
i
know
but
i
was
so
afraid
they
find
out
some
way
they
did
from
me
she
raised
startled
eyes
to
his
face
you
do
mean
they
know
where
i
am
oh
no
but
the
doctor
stirred
uneasily
denby
do
you
think
wo
you
let
me
tell
them
where
you
are
do
they
want
to
know
yes
they
are
trying
very
hard
to
find
you
of
course
but
if
they
find
me
what
then
does
burke
want
me
the
doctor
flushed
well
he
yes
that
is
he
well
of
course
you
do
have
to
say
any
more
doctor
interposed
helen
denby
smiling
a
little
sadly
the
red
deepened
on
the
doctor
face
well
of
course
burke
is
very
angry
and
very
bitter
just
now
he
explained
defensively
but
if
you
two
could
be
brought
together
he
paused
helplessly
she
shook
her
head
be
the
same
old
story
only
worse
i
see
so
many
things
now
that
i
never
saw
before
even
if
he
said
right
now
that
he
wanted
me
i
would
go
back
i
would
dare
to
be
a
day
before
he
be
ashamed
of
me
again
maybe
some
time
i
learn
she
paused
her
eyes
wistfully
fixed
out
the
window
but
if
i
do
she
turned
almost
frenziedly
betty
will
betty
is
going
to
be
a
lady
from
right
now
then
some
day
i
show
her
to
him
he
wo
be
ashamed
of
betty
you
see
if
he
is
again
the
doctor
stirred
uneasily
but
think
how
can
i
go
on
from
day
to
day
and
not
let
your
husband
know
helen
denby
sprang
to
her
feet
the
wild
look
of
that
first
night
of
flight
came
into
her
eyes
but
her
voice
when
she
spoke
was
very
calm
gleason
she
began
resolutely
it
just
as
i
told
you
before
unless
you
promise
not
to
tell
burke
where
i
am
till
i
say
the
word
i
shall
take
betty
and
go
somewhere
i
do
know
where
but
it
be
where
you
ca
find
me
any
of
you
oh
come
come
my
dear
child
will
you
promise
but
just
think
how
i
thinking
choked
helen
but
do
seem
to
be
you
see
how
i
want
to
stay
here
i
got
a
chance
maybe
to
be
like
you
and
your
sister
and
all
the
rest
of
burke
swell
i
mean
like
burke
friends
she
corrected
with
a
hot
blush
and
anyhow
got
a
chance
we
made
a
start
we
begun
and
here
you
want
to
go
and
tip
it
all
over
by
telling
burke
and
there
ca
anything
good
happen
if
burke
knows
besides
did
he
say
himself
that
we
to
have
a
vacation
from
each
other
now
wo
you
promise
please
with
a
despairing
cry
the
doctor
threw
up
his
hands
oh
good
heavens
yes
of
course
i
promise
he
groaned
i
suspect
you
could
make
me
promise
to
shave
my
head
and
dance
the
tango
barefooted
down
washington
street
if
you
set
out
to
oh
yes
promise
but
i
can
tell
you
right
now
that
i
shall
wake
up
in
the
dead
of
night
and
pinch
myself
to
make
sure
i
promised
he
finished
with
wrathful
emphasis
helen
laughed
she
even
tossed
the
doctor
a
playful
glance
as
she
turned
to
go
all
right
i
do
care
a
mite
how
much
you
pinch
yourself
she
declared
you
promised
and
that
all
i
care
for
and
she
left
the
room
with
buoyant
step
you
see
observed
thayer
significantly
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
yes
i
see
so
far
nodded
frank
gleason
with
a
sigh
but
i
do
wish
i
could
see
what
the
end
is
going
to
be
it
is
given
to
us
to
see
ends
responded
thayer
sententiously
we
can
only
attend
to
the
beginnings
and
make
them
right
humph
grunted
her
brother
with
some
asperity
i
not
saying
i
like
the
beginning
in
this
case
honestly
to
speak
plainly
my
dear
edith
i
consider
this
thing
one
big
fool
business
from
beginning
to
end
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
very
quietly
thayer
asked
can
you
suggest
dear
all
things
considered
anything
else
for
us
to
do
than
what
we
doing
no
confound
it
and
that
what
the
matter
groaned
frank
gleason
but
that
is
saying
that
i
to
play
the
fool
well
i
should
worry
i
not
worrying
replied
his
sister
with
an
enigmatic
smile
maybe
not
but
i
glad
i
going
on
that
arctic
trip
and
that
just
next
month
i
as
soon
not
see
much
of
the
denbys
just
now
feel
too
much
like
the
villain
in
a
dime
movie
growled
the
doctor
getting
to
his
feet
and
striding
from
the
room
chapter
xiv
an
understudy
soon
after
the
doctor
started
on
his
trip
to
the
north
the
thayers
closed
their
beacon
street
home
and
went
to
their
north
shore
cottage
the
move
was
made
a
little
earlier
than
usual
this
year
a
fact
which
pleased
the
children
not
a
little
and
delighted
helen
denby
especially
you
see
i
always
so
afraid
in
boston
she
explained
to
thayer
as
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
north
station
afraid
that
somewhere
on
the
street
or
somewhere
i
meet
some
one
from
dalton
or
somebody
that
knew
my
husband
thayer
frowned
slightly
yes
i
know
and
there
was
danger
of
course
but
helen
that
brings
up
exactly
the
subject
that
i
been
intending
to
speak
to
you
about
thus
far
and
advisedly
i
know
we
have
kept
you
carefully
in
the
background
my
dear
but
this
is
going
to
do
forever
you
know
why
not
i
i
like
it
thayer
smiled
but
she
frowned
again
thoughtfully
i
know
dear
but
if
you
are
to
learn
this
this
thayer
stumbled
and
paused
as
she
always
stumbled
and
paused
when
she
tried
to
reduce
to
words
her
present
extraordinary
mission
you
will
have
to
to
learn
to
meet
people
and
mingle
with
them
easily
and
naturally
the
earnest
look
of
the
eager
student
came
at
once
to
helen
face
you
mean
i
have
to
meet
and
mingle
with
swell
people
if
i
too
am
oh
that
horrid
word
again
thayer
ca
i
learn
to
stop
using
it
but
you
mean
i
know
what
you
mean
you
mean
i
have
to
meet
and
mingle
with
with
ladies
and
gentlemen
if
i
to
be
one
myself
is
that
it
of
course
only
the
very
words
and
have
been
so
abused
that
we
we
oh
helen
helen
you
do
put
things
so
baldly
and
it
sounds
so
so
do
you
see
dear
it
all
just
as
i
told
you
lots
of
times
the
minute
you
begin
to
talk
about
it
you
lose
it
it
something
that
comes
to
you
by
absorption
and
intuition
but
there
are
things
i
have
to
learn
thayer
real
things
like
holding
your
fork
and
clothes
and
finger
nails
and
not
speaking
so
loud
and
not
talking
about
being
and
and
yes
yes
i
know
interrupted
thayer
with
a
touch
of
desperation
but
after
all
it
all
so
so
impossible
and
she
stopped
abruptly
at
the
look
of
terrified
dismay
that
always
leaped
to
helen
denby
eyes
in
response
to
such
a
word
no
no
i
do
mean
that
but
really
helen
she
went
on
hurriedly
the
time
has
come
when
you
must
be
seen
more
and
it
will
be
quite
safe
at
the
shore
i
am
sure
you
meet
no
one
who
ever
saw
you
in
dalton
that
is
certain
then
of
course
if
you
say
i
have
to
i
have
to
that
all
i
do
say
it
my
but
i
dread
it
helen
drew
in
her
breath
and
bit
her
lip
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
do
it
then
smiled
thayer
briskly
you
to
learn
to
dread
it
see
and
it
be
easier
than
you
think
there
are
some
very
pleasant
people
coming
down
the
gillespies
reynolds
and
her
little
gladys
about
betty
age
by
the
way
and
next
month
there
be
the
drew
girls
and
donald
estey
and
his
brother
john
later
there
will
be
others
the
chandlers
and
eric
shaw
and
i
going
to
begin
immediately
to
have
them
see
you
and
have
you
see
them
they
know
me
as
darling
of
course
a
friend
of
mine
but
i
want
to
to
help
in
some
way
you
do
help
you
help
with
the
children
your
companionship
but
that
the
way
i
learned
so
many
things
mrs
thayer
of
course
and
that
the
way
you
learn
many
other
things
but
there
are
others
still
others
that
you
can
learn
in
no
way
as
well
as
by
association
with
the
sort
of
men
and
women
you
will
meet
this
summer
i
do
mean
that
you
are
to
be
with
them
my
dear
but
i
do
mean
that
you
must
be
with
them
enough
so
that
it
is
a
matter
of
supreme
indifference
to
you
whether
you
are
with
them
or
not
do
you
understand
you
must
learn
to
be
at
ease
with
anybody
see
helen
sighed
and
nodded
her
head
slowly
yes
i
think
i
do
thayer
and
i
will
try
so
hard
she
hesitated
then
asked
abruptly
who
is
donald
estey
please
there
was
an
odd
something
in
thayer
laugh
as
she
answered
and
why
pray
do
you
single
him
out
because
of
something
different
in
your
voice
when
you
said
his
name
thayer
laughed
again
that
more
cleverly
put
than
you
know
child
she
shrugged
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
i
fancy
we
all
do
say
donald
name
with
a
difference
is
he
so
very
important
then
in
his
own
estimation
yes
there
i
was
wrong
to
say
that
helen
and
you
must
forget
it
donald
estey
is
a
very
wealthy
very
capable
very
delightful
and
brilliant
young
bachelor
he
is
a
little
spoiled
perhaps
but
that
our
fault
and
not
his
i
suspect
for
he
petted
and
made
of
enough
to
turn
any
man
head
he
very
entertaining
he
knows
something
about
everything
he
can
talk
egyptian
scarabs
with
my
brother
and
irish
crochet
with
me
and
then
turn
around
and
discuss
politics
with
my
husband
and
quote
poetry
to
phillis
drew
in
the
next
breath
all
this
of
course
makes
him
a
very
popular
man
but
he
a
a
real
gentleman
the
kind
that
my
husband
would
like
why
of
of
course
thayer
frowned
slightly
then
suddenly
she
laughed
to
tell
the
truth
he
very
like
your
husband
in
some
ways
i
heard
my
brother
say
tastes
temperament
and
so
forth
an
odd
something
leaped
to
helen
denby
eyes
you
mean
what
likes
burke
likes
she
questioned
why
you
might
put
it
that
way
i
suppose
but
never
mind
you
see
for
yourself
when
you
see
him
yes
i
see
when
i
see
him
helen
denby
nodded
and
relaxed
in
her
seat
the
odd
something
was
still
smouldering
in
her
eyes
then
it
all
settled
remember
smiled
thayer
you
not
to
run
and
hide
now
when
somebody
comes
you
to
learn
to
meet
people
that
your
next
lesson
my
next
lesson
my
next
lesson
repeated
helen
denby
half
under
her
breath
oh
i
hope
i
learn
so
much
in
this
next
lesson
i
wo
run
and
hide
now
indeed
i
wo
mrs
thayer
and
at
the
glorified
earnestness
of
her
face
thayer
watching
felt
suddenly
her
own
throat
tighten
convulsively
in
spite
of
her
valiant
promise
helen
denby
a
week
later
did
almost
run
and
hide
when
the
gillespies
the
first
of
thayer
guests
arrived
held
however
by
a
stern
something
within
her
she
bravely
stood
her
ground
and
forced
herself
to
meet
and
gillespie
and
their
daughters
miss
alice
and
miss
maud
it
was
not
so
difficult
the
next
week
when
reynolds
came
perhaps
because
of
the
pretty
little
gladys
so
near
her
own
betty
age
fully
alive
to
her
own
shortcomings
however
embarrassed
and
distrustful
of
herself
helen
was
careful
never
to
push
herself
forward
never
to
take
the
initiative
and
because
she
was
so
quiet
and
unobtrusive
her
intense
watchfulness
and
slavish
imitation
of
what
she
saw
passed
unnoticed
gradually
as
the
days
came
and
went
the
tenseness
of
her
concentration
relaxed
and
she
began
to
move
and
speak
with
less
studied
caution
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
donald
estey
arrived
instantly
into
her
bearing
sprang
an
entirely
new
alert
eagerness
but
this
too
passed
unnoticed
for
the
change
was
not
in
herself
alone
the
entire
household
had
made
instant
response
to
the
presence
of
donald
estey
the
men
sharpened
their
wits
and
the
women
freshened
their
furbelows
breakfast
was
served
on
the
minute
with
never
a
vacant
chair
and
even
the
steps
of
the
maids
in
the
kitchen
quickened
because
donald
estey
was
always
surrounded
by
an
admiring
group
the
fact
that
that
quiet
little
mrs
darling
was
almost
invariably
one
of
the
group
did
not
attract
attention
it
was
donald
estey
himself
in
fact
who
first
noticed
it
and
the
reason
that
he
noticed
it
was
because
once
when
she
was
not
there
he
found
himself
looking
for
her
eager
face
he
realized
then
that
for
some
time
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
finding
his
chief
inspiration
in
a
certain
pair
of
wondrously
beautiful
blue
eyes
bent
full
upon
himself
not
that
the
encountering
of
admiring
feminine
eyes
bent
full
upon
him
was
a
new
experience
to
donald
estey
but
that
these
eyes
were
different
there
was
something
strangely
fascinating
and
compelling
in
their
earnest
gaze
it
was
on
the
day
that
he
first
missed
them
that
he
suddenly
decided
to
cultivate
their
owner
he
began
by
asking
casual
questions
of
his
fellow
guests
but
he
could
find
out
very
little
concerning
the
lady
she
was
a
mrs
darling
a
friend
of
their
hostess
which
he
knew
already
she
was
a
widow
they
believed
though
they
had
never
heard
her
husband
mentioned
she
was
pleasant
enough
but
so
shy
and
retiring
charming
face
she
had
though
and
beautiful
eyes
but
did
he
not
think
she
was
well
a
little
peculiar
donald
estey
did
not
answer
this
directly
he
became
indeed
always
very
evasive
when
his
fellow
guests
turned
about
and
began
to
question
him
very
soon
too
he
ceased
his
own
questioning
but
that
he
had
not
lost
his
interest
in
mrs
darling
was
most
unmistakably
shown
at
once
for
openly
and
systematically
he
began
to
seek
her
society
to
the
varying
opinions
but
unvarying
interest
of
the
rest
of
the
house
party
if
donald
estey
had
expected
mrs
darling
to
be
shy
and
coy
at
his
advances
he
found
himself
entirely
mistaken
she
welcomed
him
with
a
frank
delight
that
was
most
flattering
at
the
same
time
most
puzzling
owing
to
a
certain
elusive
quality
that
he
could
not
name
donald
estey
thought
that
he
knew
women
well
it
pleased
his
fancy
to
think
that
he
had
his
feminine
friends
nicely
pigeonholed
and
labeled
and
that
he
had
but
to
pass
an
hour
or
two
of
intimate
talk
with
any
woman
to
be
able
at
once
to
ticket
her
accurately
his
first
hour
of
intimate
talk
with
mrs
darling
however
left
him
confused
and
baffled
but
mightily
interested
in
the
course
of
that
one
hour
he
had
shelved
her
in
almost
every
one
of
his
pigeonholes
only
to
find
at
the
end
of
it
that
she
was
still
free
and
uncatalogued
she
was
a
flirt
she
was
not
a
flirt
she
was
sincere
she
was
hypocritical
she
was
brilliantly
subtle
she
was
incredibly
stupid
she
was
charming
she
was
commonplace
she
was
as
clear
as
crystal
she
was
as
inscrutable
as
a
sphinx
and
she
was
all
these
things
in
that
one
short
first
hour
at
the
end
of
it
donald
estey
with
a
long
breath
and
a
frown
but
with
a
quickened
pulse
decided
that
he
would
have
another
hour
with
her
as
soon
as
possible
he
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
it
mrs
darling
indeed
seemed
quite
as
desirous
of
his
society
as
he
was
of
hers
yet
there
was
still
the
elusive
something
in
her
manner
that
robbed
it
of
all
offensive
eagerness
again
after
the
hour
intimate
talk
estey
found
himself
confused
and
baffled
with
the
lady
still
outside
his
pigeonholes
nor
did
he
find
the
situation
changed
the
next
day
or
the
next
then
suddenly
he
awoke
to
a
new
element
in
the
case
the
extraordinary
deference
that
was
being
paid
his
lightest
wish
or
preference
on
the
part
of
mrs
darling
at
first
doubting
the
accuracy
of
his
suspicions
he
systematically
put
her
to
the
test
choosing
purposely
the
most
obvious
and
unmistakable
blue
was
his
favorite
color
he
said
she
appeared
in
blue
the
next
day
browning
was
his
poet
he
declared
in
less
than
an
hour
he
found
her
poring
over
pippa
passes
in
the
library
a
woman
who
could
talk
and
talk
well
on
current
events
won
his
sincere
admiration
every
time
he
told
her
he
wondered
the
next
morning
how
late
she
must
have
sat
up
the
night
before
studying
the
merits
and
demerits
of
the
four
presidential
candidates
donald
estey
was
flattered
amused
and
curiously
interested
not
that
what
looked
to
be
a
determined
assault
upon
his
heart
was
exactly
a
new
experience
for
him
but
that
the
circumstances
in
this
case
were
so
out
of
the
ordinary
and
that
he
was
still
trying
to
place
this
young
woman
he
was
not
sure
even
always
that
she
was
trying
to
make
a
bid
for
his
affections
he
was
not
sure
either
of
his
own
mind
regarding
her
in
spite
of
his
interest
he
was
conscious
sometimes
of
a
distinct
feeling
of
aversion
toward
her
she
was
not
always
to
his
mind
quite
the
lady
though
she
was
improving
in
that
respect
even
in
his
thoughts
the
word
gave
him
a
shock
he
could
hardly
imagine
a
candidate
for
the
position
of
donald
estey
in
need
of
improvement
but
she
was
beautiful
and
there
was
something
wonderfully
alluring
in
her
eager
way
of
listening
to
his
every
word
she
was
indeed
not
a
little
refreshing
after
the
languid
conservatism
of
some
of
the
sophisticated
young
women
one
usually
found
at
these
country
houses
besides
was
she
after
all
really
in
love
with
him
very
likely
she
was
not
at
all
events
it
could
do
no
harm
this
mild
flirtation
if
flirtation
it
were
he
would
not
worry
about
it
plenty
of
time
yet
to
to
withdraw
he
had
but
to
receive
apparently
a
summoning
message
and
he
could
go
at
once
that
would
of
course
end
the
affair
meanwhile
but
just
exactly
what
type
of
woman
was
she
anyway
still
amused
interested
and
contentedly
secure
therefore
donald
estey
pursued
for
another
week
his
pleasant
pastime
of
finding
just
the
proper
pigeonhole
for
this
tantalizing
of
femininity
then
sharply
he
received
a
jolt
that
left
him
figuratively
almost
literally
breathless
and
gasping
they
were
talking
of
marriage
but
you
yourself
have
never
married
she
said
no
i
have
never
married
i
wonder
why
donald
estey
frowned
and
stirred
restlessly
there
were
times
when
mrs
darling
unconventionality
was
not
refreshing
perhaps
the
right
girl
has
never
found
me
he
shrugged
oh
estey
please
what
sort
of
a
girl
would
be
the
right
one
for
you
well
really
er
he
stopped
and
stirred
again
uneasily
there
was
an
almost
frenzied
earnestness
in
her
face
and
manner
that
was
somewhat
disconcerting
that
might
be
hard
telling
he
evaded
banteringly
but
you
tell
me
estey
i
know
you
could
and
oh
you
please
why
er
mrs
darling
he
gave
an
embarrassed
laugh
as
he
sought
for
just
the
right
word
to
say
you
seem
er
extraordinarily
interested
he
laughed
again
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
knew
that
he
had
said
just
the
thing
i
am
interested
indeed
estey
it
would
mean
you
can
not
know
what
it
would
mean
if
you
tell
me
why
er
really
yes
yes
i
know
i
had
ought
to
talk
like
this
ladies
do
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
but
it
because
i
want
to
so
because
i
must
know
please
wo
you
tell
me
with
a
quick
lifting
of
his
head
donald
estey
pulled
himself
sharply
together
flattering
as
it
was
to
be
thus
deferred
to
this
flirtation
if
flirtation
it
were
had
gone
quite
far
enough
he
laughed
again
lightly
and
sprang
to
his
feet
could
think
of
it
mrs
darling
really
i
could
you
know
mr
estey
she
too
was
on
her
feet
she
had
laid
a
persuasive
hand
on
his
arm
please
you
think
i
joking
but
i
not
i
really
mean
it
if
you
only
would
do
it
it
would
mean
so
much
to
me
and
do
do
look
at
me
like
that
i
i
not
being
proper
and
i
know
ladies
do
do
so
what
i
doing
but
when
i
saw
it
such
a
splendid
chance
to
ask
you
i
i
just
had
to
do
it
but
but
the
startled
nonplussed
man
stuttered
like
a
bashful
schoolboy
it
really
is
so
so
absurd
mrs
darling
when
you
er
stop
to
think
of
it
she
sighed
despairingly
but
she
did
not
take
her
hand
from
his
arm
then
if
she
spoke
hurriedly
and
with
evident
embarrassment
if
you
wo
tell
me
that
way
wo
you
please
tell
me
another
could
you
would
you
am
i
like
that
girl
mr
estey
donald
estey
was
guilty
of
an
actual
gasp
of
dismay
in
a
whirl
of
vexation
at
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
he
groped
blindly
for
a
safe
way
out
of
course
young
women
young
women
such
as
he
knew
did
not
really
propose
to
one
but
was
it
possible
that
that
was
exactly
what
this
somewhat
remarkable
young
widow
was
doing
it
seemed
incredible
and
yet
am
i
estey
or
do
you
think
i
could
learn
why
er
er
i
mean
would
you
could
you
marry
every
vestige
of
slipped
from
the
tortured
man
like
a
garment
conscious
only
of
an
insane
desire
to
flee
from
this
wretched
woman
who
was
about
to
march
him
to
the
altar
he
quite
jerked
his
arm
free
well
really
mrs
darling
i
i
you
would
i
can
see
you
would
there
was
a
heartbroken
little
sob
in
her
voice
but
but
mrs
darling
oh
hang
it
all
what
a
perfectly
preposterous
situation
he
stormed
wrathfully
i
do
want
to
marry
anybody
i
tell
you
i
not
a
marrying
man
i
he
stopped
short
at
the
astounding
change
that
had
come
to
the
little
woman
opposite
she
was
staring
into
his
face
with
a
growing
terror
that
suddenly
at
its
height
broke
into
a
gale
of
hysterical
laughter
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
dropped
into
the
chair
behind
her
oh
oh
you
did
you
did
but
you
she
choked
swaying
her
body
back
and
forth
the
next
moment
she
was
on
her
feet
facing
him
a
new
something
in
her
eyes
the
laughter
was
quite
gone
you
need
worry
donald
estey
she
spoke
hurriedly
and
with
all
the
wild
of
her
old
self
i
was
asking
you
to
marry
me
so
you
do
have
to
refuse
her
voice
quivered
with
hurt
pride
why
of
course
not
of
course
not
my
dear
lady
he
caught
at
the
straw
i
never
thought
yes
you
did
and
you
was
floundering
around
trying
to
find
a
way
to
say
no
i
was
good
enough
for
you
and
that
just
what
i
was
trying
to
find
out
too
but
it
hurt
just
the
same
when
i
did
find
out
oh
but
mrs
darling
i
did
mean
yes
you
did
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
and
in
the
way
you
drew
back
only
i
i
did
mean
i
never
thought
of
your
taking
it
that
way
that
i
wanted
to
marry
it
was
some
one
else
that
i
meant
some
one
the
stupefaction
in
the
man
face
deepened
yes
you
do
know
him
but
they
said
you
was
i
mean
like
him
that
what
liked
he
would
like
see
and
that
why
i
tried
to
find
out
what
what
you
did
like
so
i
could
learn
to
be
what
would
please
him
the
petted
idol
of
unnumbered
blinked
his
eyes
you
mean
you
were
using
as
an
er
understudy
he
demanded
yes
no
i
do
know
i
was
just
trying
to
walk
and
talk
and
breathe
and
move
the
way
you
wanted
me
to
so
i
could
do
it
by
and
by
for
him
donald
estey
drew
in
his
breath
well
by
jove
and
i
going
to
she
lifted
her
chin
determinedly
going
to
and
now
you
know
why
i
asked
you
what
i
did
i
was
hoping
i
i
had
gained
a
little
in
all
these
weeks
i
been
trying
so
hard
and
before
you
came
when
thayer
told
me
you
were
like
like
the
man
i
love
i
determined
then
to
watch
you
and
study
you
and
do
everything
the
way
you
liked
if
i
could
find
out
what
it
was
and
now
to
have
you
think
i
was
you
to
to
as
if
i
ever
marry
she
choked
the
next
moment
with
a
wild
fling
of
her
arms
she
was
gone
alone
donald
estey
drew
a
long
breath
as
he
turned
he
faced
his
own
image
in
the
mirror
across
the
room
slowly
he
advanced
toward
it
there
was
a
quizzical
smile
in
his
eyes
donald
me
boy
he
apostrophized
you
have
been
rejected
do
you
hear
jove
but
what
an
extraordinary
young
woman
his
eyes
left
the
mirror
and
sought
the
door
by
which
she
had
gone
donald
estey
did
not
see
mrs
darling
again
during
his
stay
a
sudden
indisposition
prevented
her
from
being
among
the
guests
for
some
days
chapter
xv
a
woman
will
gleason
arctic
trip
designed
to
cover
a
year
of
research
and
discovery
prolonged
itself
into
three
years
and
two
months
shipwrecks
thrilling
escapes
months
of
silence
and
a
period
when
hope
for
the
safety
of
the
party
was
quite
gone
all
figured
in
the
story
before
the
heroic
rescue
brought
a
happier
ending
to
what
had
come
so
near
to
being
another
tragedy
of
the
north
it
was
june
when
frank
gleason
in
the
care
of
a
nurse
and
a
physician
arrived
at
his
sister
summer
cottage
by
the
sea
for
a
month
after
his
coming
frank
gleason
was
too
ill
to
ask
many
questions
but
with
returning
strength
came
an
insistence
upon
an
answer
to
a
query
he
had
already
several
times
put
to
his
sister
edith
what
of
the
denbys
where
is
helen
why
do
you
always
evade
any
questions
about
her
she
is
here
with
me
here
yes
and
she
a
great
comfort
and
help
to
me
and
burke
does
know
yet
where
she
is
not
that
we
know
of
impossible
all
this
time
oh
i
do
know
all
our
friends
know
her
as
darling
the
denbys
never
come
here
and
they
never
think
of
looking
here
for
her
anyway
we
figured
that
out
long
ago
but
it
ca
go
on
forever
when
is
she
going
back
an
odd
look
crossed
thayer
face
i
do
know
frank
but
not
for
some
time
if
ever
i
should
judge
from
present
indications
ever
good
heavens
edith
what
do
you
mean
demanded
the
doctor
pulling
himself
up
in
his
chair
i
no
good
would
come
of
this
there
there
dear
never
mind
all
this
now
begged
his
sister
please
do
try
to
talk
about
it
any
more
but
i
will
talk
about
it
edith
i
want
to
know
and
you
might
just
as
well
tell
me
in
the
first
place
and
not
hang
back
and
hesitate
protested
the
doctor
with
all
the
irritability
of
a
naturally
strong
man
who
finds
himself
so
unaccountably
weak
in
his
convalescence
what
the
trouble
has
that
er
business
worked
out
well
i
did
think
it
would
edith
thayer
laughed
softly
on
the
contrary
it
working
beautifully
wait
till
you
see
her
a
dear
a
very
charming
woman
she
developed
wonderfully
but
along
with
it
all
has
come
to
her
a
very
deep
and
genuine
and
rather
curious
humility
together
with
a
pride
the
chief
aim
of
which
is
to
avoid
anything
like
the
position
in
which
she
found
herself
as
the
mortifying
wife
of
burke
denby
humph
commented
the
doctor
that
burke
does
love
her
she
is
thoroughly
convinced
to
go
to
him
now
tacitly
asking
to
be
taken
back
she
feels
to
be
impossible
she
has
no
notion
of
going
where
she
is
wanted
and
she
feels
very
sure
she
wanted
by
either
burke
or
his
father
of
course
the
longer
it
runs
and
the
longer
she
stays
away
the
harder
it
seems
for
her
to
make
herself
known
oh
but
this
go
on
forever
protested
frank
gleason
again
restlessly
i
see
burke
as
soon
as
i
on
my
feet
again
i
shall
run
up
there
but
you
given
your
promise
not
to
tell
remember
yes
yes
i
know
i
sha
tell
of
course
but
i
can
bring
back
something
i
sure
that
will
will
cause
this
stubborn
young
woman
to
change
her
mind
i
doubt
it
helen
says
she
not
ready
to
go
back
yet
anyway
not
sufficiently
i
suppose
laughed
the
doctor
a
little
grimly
perhaps
then
too
she
has
other
plans
all
made
oh
she
has
yes
she
going
abroad
do
you
remember
angie
reynolds
angie
ried
you
know
married
ned
reynolds
yes
nice
girl
well
they
going
abroad
for
some
years
some
business
for
the
firm
i
believe
anyway
ned
will
have
to
be
months
at
a
time
in
different
cities
and
angie
and
little
gladys
are
going
with
him
they
have
asked
helen
and
betty
to
go
too
and
helen
has
agreed
to
go
and
leave
you
at
the
indignant
expression
on
her
brother
face
edith
thayer
laughed
merrily
but
my
dear
frank
i
thought
you
were
just
threatening
to
helen
to
leave
me
she
challenged
so
i
was
retorted
the
doctor
nothing
daunted
but
it
was
to
get
her
to
go
home
where
she
belonged
not
on
any
chase
like
this
abroad
business
what
does
she
want
to
be
presented
at
court
maybe
she
thinks
that
going
to
do
the
job
oh
come
come
frank
now
you
sarcastic
thayer
voice
was
earnest
though
her
eyes
were
twinkling
it
is
a
chase
a
bit
it
a
very
sensible
plan
in
the
first
place
it
takes
helen
out
of
the
country
which
is
wise
if
she
still
going
to
try
to
keep
her
whereabouts
a
secret
from
burke
for
eventually
some
one
somewhere
would
see
her
some
one
who
knew
her
face
she
ca
always
live
so
secluded
a
life
as
she
has
these
past
three
years
of
course
we
have
spent
the
greater
share
of
that
time
at
the
beach
here
coming
early
and
staying
late
but
that
is
all
angie
has
taken
a
great
fancy
to
both
helen
and
dorothy
elizabeth
and
she
likes
to
have
gladys
with
them
the
children
are
the
same
age
about
five
you
know
and
great
cronies
angie
is
taking
helen
as
a
sort
of
her
duties
will
be
light
and
congenial
both
the
children
will
be
in
her
charge
and
their
treatment
and
advantages
will
be
identical
there
will
be
a
nursery
governess
under
her
and
she
herself
will
be
much
with
angie
which
will
be
invaluable
to
her
in
many
ways
and
by
the
way
frank
the
fact
that
a
woman
like
angie
reynolds
is
taking
her
for
a
traveling
companion
shows
more
conclusively
than
anything
else
could
how
greatly
improved
helen
is
what
a
really
charming
woman
she
has
come
to
be
but
it
is
a
splendid
chance
for
her
certainly
and
especially
for
betty
her
whole
life
centers
now
in
betty
and
i
urged
her
taking
it
at
first
she
demurred
on
account
of
leaving
me
but
i
succeeded
in
convincing
her
that
it
was
altogether
too
good
an
opportunity
to
lose
opportunity
indeed
when
does
she
go
the
last
of
next
month
oh
that
all
right
then
i
shall
see
burke
long
before
that
the
doctor
settled
back
in
his
chair
with
a
relieved
sigh
his
sister
eyed
him
with
a
disturbed
frown
frank
dear
you
ca
do
anything
she
ventured
at
last
did
i
tell
you
she
was
ready
to
go
back
but
she
have
to
go
some
time
perhaps
but
wait
i
not
going
to
say
another
word
now
nor
let
you
wait
till
you
see
her
and
you
shall
see
her
in
a
day
or
two
just
as
soon
as
you
are
strong
enough
but
not
another
word
now
and
to
make
sure
that
he
obeyed
thayer
rose
laughingly
and
left
the
room
it
was
four
days
later
that
frank
gleason
for
the
first
time
ventured
downstairs
and
out
into
the
warm
sunshine
on
the
south
veranda
hearing
a
child
gleeful
laugh
and
a
woman
gently
remonstrative
voice
a
voice
that
he
thought
he
recognized
he
walked
the
length
of
the
veranda
and
rounded
the
corner
his
slippered
feet
made
no
sound
so
quite
unheralded
he
came
upon
the
woman
and
the
little
girl
on
the
wide
veranda
steps
neither
one
saw
him
and
he
stopped
short
at
the
corner
his
eyes
alight
with
sudden
admiration
frank
gleason
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
more
lovely
little
girl
and
she
was
the
typical
of
picture
and
romance
on
the
topmost
step
she
was
reaching
one
dimpled
hand
for
a
gorgeous
red
geranium
blooming
in
a
pot
decorating
the
balustrade
in
the
other
hand
tightly
clutched
was
another
gorgeous
blossom
sadly
crushed
and
broken
she
was
laughing
gleefully
near
her
but
not
attempting
to
touch
her
was
a
woman
the
doctor
recognized
at
once
it
was
helen
but
helen
with
a
subtle
difference
of
face
eyes
hair
dress
and
manner
that
was
at
once
illuminating
but
baffling
betty
dear
she
was
saying
gently
no
no
mother
said
not
to
pick
the
flowers
the
child
turned
roguish
willful
eyes
but
i
wants
to
pick
mother
ca
let
you
dear
and
see
they
are
so
much
prettier
growing
the
small
red
lips
pouted
the
little
curly
head
gave
a
vigorous
shake
but
i
wants
to
grow
in
my
hands
so
insisted
a
threateningly
tearful
voice
as
the
tightly
clutched
flower
was
thrust
forward
for
inspection
but
they
wo
grow
there
darling
see
this
one
is
all
crumpled
and
broken
now
it
ca
even
lift
its
poor
little
head
come
we
do
want
the
rest
to
be
like
that
do
we
come
come
away
with
me
the
young
eyes
grew
mutinous
i
wants
to
grow
in
my
hand
insisted
the
red
lips
again
but
mother
does
there
was
a
resolute
note
of
decision
in
the
quiet
voice
now
but
suddenly
it
grew
wonderfully
soft
and
vibrant
and
daddy
would
either
dearie
only
think
how
sorry
daddy
would
be
to
see
that
poor
little
flower
in
betty
hand
as
if
in
response
to
a
potent
something
in
her
mother
voice
eyes
grew
roundly
serious
why
would
daddy
be
sorry
because
daddy
loves
all
beautiful
things
and
he
wants
them
to
stay
beautiful
and
this
poor
little
flower
in
betty
hand
wo
be
beautiful
much
longer
i
fear
it
is
all
broken
and
crushed
and
daddy
with
a
sudden
sense
of
guilt
as
if
trespassing
on
holy
ground
the
doctor
strode
forward
noisily
so
this
is
dorothy
elizabeth
and
her
mother
he
began
gayly
but
he
could
get
no
further
helen
denby
turned
with
a
joyous
cry
and
an
eagerly
extended
hand
oh
gleason
i
so
glad
you
better
are
you
i
so
glad
to
see
you
yes
i
better
i
well
only
i
ca
seem
to
make
people
believe
it
and
you
i
do
need
to
ask
how
you
are
and
so
this
big
girl
is
the
little
dorothy
elizabeth
i
used
to
know
you
have
your
mother
eyes
my
dear
come
wo
you
shake
hands
with
me
the
little
girl
advanced
slowly
her
gaze
searching
the
doctor
face
then
in
her
sweet
treble
came
the
somewhat
disconcerting
question
is
you
daddy
the
doctor
laughed
lightly
no
my
dear
i
a
poor
unfortunate
man
who
has
any
little
girl
like
you
but
we
hope
one
of
these
days
you
see
daddy
he
turned
to
helen
denby
with
suddenly
grave
questioning
eyes
betty
dear
denby
refused
to
meet
the
doctor
gaze
go
carry
the
flower
to
annie
and
ask
her
please
to
put
it
in
water
for
you
then
run
out
and
play
with
bessie
in
the
garden
mother
wants
to
talk
to
gleason
a
few
minutes
then
to
the
doctor
she
turned
an
agitated
face
surely
did
your
sister
tell
you
i
going
to
london
with
mrs
reynolds
yes
she
told
me
but
perhaps
i
was
hoping
to
persuade
you
to
do
otherwise
her
eyes
grew
troubled
but
it
such
a
fine
chance
for
more
of
this
business
i
suppose
cut
in
the
doctor
a
bit
brusquely
she
turned
reproachful
eyes
upon
him
oh
please
doctor
do
make
fun
of
me
like
as
if
i
make
fun
of
you
child
cut
in
the
doctor
still
more
sharply
oh
but
i
ca
blame
you
of
course
she
smiled
wistfully
and
especially
now
that
i
see
myself
how
absurd
i
was
to
think
for
a
minute
that
i
could
make
myself
over
into
a
a
the
sort
of
wife
that
burke
denby
would
wish
to
have
absurd
that
you
could
come
come
what
nonsense
are
you
talking
snapped
the
doctor
but
it
is
nonsense
objected
helen
denby
earnestly
do
you
suppose
i
know
i
used
to
think
it
was
something
you
could
learn
as
you
would
a
poem
or
that
you
could
put
on
to
you
as
you
would
a
new
dress
but
i
know
now
it
something
inside
of
you
that
has
to
grow
and
grow
just
as
you
grow
and
i
afraid
all
the
putting
on
and
learning
in
the
world
wo
get
there
oh
come
come
mrs
denby
expostulated
the
doctor
in
obvious
consternation
but
it
so
listen
she
urged
tremulously
now
i
i
just
ca
like
the
kind
of
music
burke
does
discords
and
no
tune
you
know
though
i
tried
and
tried
to
day
after
day
i
gone
into
the
and
put
in
those
records
the
classics
and
the
operatic
ones
that
are
the
real
thing
you
know
but
i
ca
like
them
and
i
still
keep
liking
tunes
and
ragtime
and
there
are
the
books
too
i
ca
help
liking
jingles
and
stories
that
something
and
i
do
like
poetry
not
real
poetry
like
browning
and
all
the
rest
of
them
browning
indeed
as
if
that
counted
child
oh
but
it
other
things
lots
of
them
vague
elusive
things
that
i
ca
put
my
finger
on
but
i
know
them
now
since
i
been
here
with
your
sister
and
her
friends
why
sometimes
it
is
anything
more
than
the
way
a
woman
speaks
or
the
way
she
sits
down
and
gets
up
or
even
the
way
a
bit
of
lace
falls
over
her
hand
but
they
all
help
and
they
helped
me
too
oh
so
much
i
so
glad
now
of
this
chance
to
thank
you
you
do
know
you
ca
know
what
it
been
for
me
to
be
here
but
i
thought
you
just
said
that
you
you
that
is
that
you
er
given
up
floundered
the
doctor
miserably
as
if
groping
for
some
sort
of
support
on
a
world
given
up
perhaps
i
have
in
a
way
for
myself
you
see
i
know
now
that
you
have
to
begin
young
that
why
i
so
happy
about
betty
i
do
mind
about
myself
any
more
if
only
i
can
make
it
all
right
for
her
gleason
i
could
i
just
have
her
father
ashamed
of
betty
ashamed
of
that
child
well
i
should
say
not
blustered
the
doctor
incoherently
nor
of
you
either
you
brave
little
woman
why
betty
a
dear
is
she
interrupted
the
mother
eagerly
you
think
she
she
be
everything
he
could
wish
i
keeping
him
always
before
her
what
he
likes
how
he
want
her
to
do
you
know
and
almost
always
i
can
make
her
mind
now
with
daddy
name
and
the
doctor
interrupted
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
my
dear
lady
ca
you
see
that
now
right
is
just
the
time
for
you
to
go
back
to
your
husband
the
eager
pleading
little
mother
opposite
became
suddenly
the
dignified
woman
has
he
said
he
wanted
me
dr
gleason
why
er
well
that
is
he
i
know
he
has
wanted
to
know
where
you
were
very
likely
but
that
is
wanting
gleason
do
you
think
i
have
any
pride
any
even
my
husband
was
ashamed
of
me
he
asked
me
to
go
away
for
a
time
he
wrote
me
with
his
own
hand
that
he
wanted
a
vacation
from
me
do
you
think
without
a
sign
or
a
word
from
him
that
i
am
going
creeping
back
to
him
and
ask
him
to
take
me
back
but
he
does
know
where
you
are
to
you
a
sign
argued
the
doctor
you
seen
him
have
you
why
but
not
lately
but
i
going
to
a
startled
look
came
into
her
eyes
the
next
minute
she
smiled
sadly
are
you
very
well
we
see
if
he
says
anything
you
wo
tell
him
where
i
am
i
know
i
have
your
promise
but
gleason
her
voice
grew
very
sweet
and
serious
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
now
with
anything
short
of
a
happy
married
life
i
know
now
what
marriage
is
where
there
is
love
and
trust
in
each
other
and
where
they
like
to
do
and
talk
about
the
same
things
i
seen
your
sister
and
her
husband
unless
i
can
that
i
going
to
bring
that
kind
of
happiness
to
burke
i
shall
not
consent
to
go
back
to
him
i
will
give
him
his
daughter
some
time
when
she
is
old
enough
i
want
him
to
see
her
when
i
know
that
he
is
proud
of
my
betty
i
may
not
mind
the
rest
so
much
perhaps
but
now
now
with
a
choking
little
cry
she
turned
and
fled
down
the
steps
and
out
on
to
the
garden
path
baffled
irritated
yet
frowningly
admiring
the
doctor
stalked
into
the
house
in
the
hall
he
came
face
to
face
with
his
sister
she
fluttered
into
instant
anxiety
why
frank
who
said
you
could
do
that
i
did
oh
the
doctor
said
so
too
he
flung
out
hurriedly
answering
the
dawning
disapproval
in
her
eyes
i
going
to
dalton
next
week
oh
but
frank
now
please
do
argue
i
going
if
you
and
the
doctor
can
get
me
well
enough
to
go
all
right
but
i
going
whether
i
well
enough
or
not
but
frank
dear
you
ca
anything
you
know
you
promised
oh
i
sha
break
any
promises
of
course
but
i
going
to
see
burke
i
going
to
find
out
if
he
really
is
ninny
enough
to
keep
on
holding
off
at
the
end
of
a
silly
quarrel
the
sweetest
little
wife
a
man
ever
had
and
i
opine
you
seen
helen
smiled
edith
thayer
with
a
sudden
twinkle
i
have
and
does
like
browning
indeed
and
ca
help
liking
tunes
oh
good
heavens
edith
if
burke
denby
does
well
we
see
next
week
he
glowered
striding
away
followed
by
the
anxious
but
still
twinkling
eyes
of
his
sister
in
accordance
with
his
threat
and
in
spite
of
protests
the
doctor
went
to
dalton
the
next
week
but
almost
by
return
train
he
was
back
again
and
why
frank
so
soon
as
this
cried
his
sister
surely
burke
denby
did
i
did
see
him
his
father
then
neither
one
they
gone
south
america
bridge
contract
went
themselves
this
time
oh
that
explains
it
why
we
have
heard
from
them
since
you
came
back
i
thought
it
strange
frank
that
not
a
word
of
congratulation
or
even
inquiry
had
come
from
them
yes
i
know
i
i
thought
it
strange
myself
a
little
but
that
does
help
this
thing
any
i
ca
very
well
go
to
south
america
to
see
burke
just
now
though
i
like
to
of
course
not
besides
do
forget
that
you
very
likely
accomplish
anything
if
you
did
see
him
so
deep
was
the
sudden
gloom
on
the
doctor
face
at
her
words
that
the
lady
added
quickly
you
did
find
out
something
in
dalton
frank
i
know
you
did
by
your
face
you
saw
some
one
oh
i
saw
brett
who
he
denby
general
manager
and
chief
factotum
well
he
ought
to
know
something
he
does
everything
but
he
wo
tell
anything
oh
and
it
right
that
he
should
of
course
it
his
business
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
he
knows
his
business
as
well
as
any
man
i
can
think
of
oh
he
was
perfectly
civil
and
apparently
very
gracious
and
in
what
he
said
what
he
say
he
said
that
they
had
gone
to
south
america
on
a
big
bridge
contract
and
that
they
would
be
home
for
four
or
five
months
yet
he
said
that
they
were
very
well
and
that
probably
when
they
came
back
from
this
trip
they
would
go
to
south
africa
for
another
six
months
i
get
anywhere
near
asking
about
helen
and
burke
present
state
of
mind
concerning
her
he
could
scent
a
question
of
that
sort
forty
words
away
and
he
invariably
veered
off
at
a
tangent
long
before
i
got
to
it
it
was
like
starting
for
new
york
and
landing
in
montreal
i
had
to
give
it
up
so
far
as
anything
i
could
learn
to
the
contrary
burke
denby
and
his
father
are
well
happy
and
perfectly
content
to
build
bridges
for
heathens
and
hottentots
the
rest
of
their
natural
existence
and
there
you
are
how
pray
in
the
face
of
that
are
we
going
to
keep
helen
from
running
off
to
london
i
should
try
but
oh
hang
it
all
edith
this
ca
go
on
oh
yes
it
can
my
dear
and
i
inclined
to
think
it
going
on
just
right
very
plainly
they
are
ready
for
each
other
yet
let
her
go
to
london
and
make
the
best
of
all
these
advantages
for
herself
and
betty
and
let
him
go
on
with
his
for
the
hottentots
do
them
good
both
of
them
and
will
be
all
the
better
for
them
when
they
do
come
together
oh
then
they
to
come
together
some
time
why
frank
of
course
they
are
you
could
keep
them
apart
declared
the
lady
with
smiling
confidence
but
edith
you
have
ever
talked
like
this
before
puzzled
the
doctor
frowning
i
never
known
before
that
burke
denby
was
building
bridges
for
the
hottentots
nonsense
that
their
business
they
always
built
bridges
yes
but
master
burke
and
his
father
have
always
gone
to
superintend
their
construction
she
flashed
in
other
words
if
burke
denby
is
trying
so
strenuously
to
get
away
from
himself
it
a
pretty
sure
sign
that
there
something
in
himself
that
he
wants
to
get
away
from
you
see
well
i
should
like
to
see
sighed
the
doctor
with
very
evident
doubt
chapter
xvi
emergencies
in
september
helen
denby
and
dorothy
elizabeth
went
to
london
with
their
going
a
measure
of
peace
came
to
frank
gleason
not
having
their
constant
presence
to
remind
him
of
his
friend
domestic
complications
he
could
the
more
easily
adopt
his
sister
complacent
attitude
of
cheery
confidence
that
it
would
all
come
out
right
in
time
that
it
come
out
right
furthermore
with
helen
not
under
his
own
roof
he
was
not
so
guiltily
conscious
of
aiding
and
abetting
a
runaway
wife
soon
after
helen
departure
for
london
a
letter
from
burke
denby
in
south
america
told
of
the
denbys
rejoicing
at
the
happy
outcome
of
the
arctic
trip
and
expressed
the
hope
that
the
doctor
was
well
and
that
they
might
meet
him
as
soon
as
possible
after
their
return
from
south
america
in
december
the
letter
was
friendly
and
cordial
but
not
long
it
told
little
of
their
work
and
nothing
of
themselves
and
in
spite
of
its
verbal
cordiality
the
doctor
felt
at
its
conclusion
that
he
had
as
it
were
been
attending
a
formal
reception
when
he
had
hoped
for
a
cozy
chat
by
the
fire
in
december
at
burke
bidding
he
ran
up
to
dalton
for
a
brief
visit
but
it
proved
to
be
as
stiff
and
unsatisfying
as
the
letter
had
been
burke
never
mentioned
his
wife
but
he
wore
so
unmistakable
an
air
that
the
doctor
much
to
his
subsequent
vexation
when
he
realized
it
went
out
of
his
way
to
be
heartily
cordial
as
if
in
refutation
of
the
disapproval
idea
which
was
not
the
impression
the
doctor
really
wished
to
convey
at
all
he
was
in
fact
very
angry
with
burke
he
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
give
him
a
piece
of
his
mind
yet
so
potent
was
burke
dignified
aloofness
that
he
found
himself
chattering
of
inca
antiquities
and
babylonian
tablets
instead
of
delivering
his
planned
dissertation
on
the
futility
of
quarrels
in
general
and
of
burke
and
helen
in
particular
with
john
denby
he
had
little
better
success
so
far
as
results
were
concerned
though
he
did
succeed
in
asking
a
few
questions
you
have
never
heard
from
mrs
denby
he
began
abruptly
the
minute
he
found
himself
alone
with
burke
father
never
but
you
you
would
like
to
the
old
man
face
became
suddenly
a
phenomenon
with
which
john
denby
business
associates
were
very
familiar
but
which
frank
gleason
had
never
happened
to
witness
before
if
you
will
pardon
me
doctor
began
john
denby
in
a
colorless
voice
i
would
rather
not
discuss
the
lady
there
is
anything
new
that
i
can
say
and
i
am
beginning
to
feel
as
does
my
son
that
i
would
rather
not
hear
her
name
mentioned
this
ended
it
of
course
there
was
nothing
the
doctor
could
say
or
do
bound
by
his
promise
to
helen
denby
he
could
not
tell
the
facts
and
silenced
by
his
host
words
and
manner
he
could
not
discuss
potentialities
there
was
nothing
for
it
therefore
but
to
drop
the
subject
and
he
dropped
it
he
went
home
the
next
day
resolutely
then
he
busied
himself
with
his
own
affairs
determinedly
he
set
himself
to
forget
the
affairs
of
the
denbys
this
was
the
more
easily
accomplished
because
of
the
long
silences
and
absences
of
the
denby
men
themselves
and
because
helen
denby
still
remained
abroad
with
angie
reynolds
in
london
helen
denby
was
living
in
a
new
world
quick
to
realize
the
advantages
that
were
now
hers
she
determined
to
make
the
most
of
them
especially
for
betty
always
everything
now
centered
around
betty
in
reynolds
helen
had
found
a
warm
friend
and
sympathetic
ally
one
who
she
knew
would
keep
quite
to
herself
the
story
helen
had
told
her
even
reynolds
was
not
let
into
the
inner
secret
of
helen
presence
with
them
to
him
she
was
a
companion
governess
a
friend
of
the
thayers
to
whom
his
wife
had
taken
a
great
fancy
a
most
charming
little
woman
indeed
whom
he
himself
liked
very
much
freed
from
the
fear
of
meeting
burke
denby
or
any
of
his
friends
helen
for
the
first
time
since
her
flight
from
dalton
felt
that
she
was
really
safe
and
that
she
could
with
an
undivided
mind
devote
her
entire
attention
to
her
task
from
london
to
berlin
and
from
berlin
to
genoa
she
went
happily
as
reynolds
business
called
him
to
helen
it
made
little
difference
where
she
was
so
long
as
she
could
force
every
picture
statue
mountain
concert
book
or
individual
to
pay
toll
to
her
insatiable
hunger
to
know
that
she
might
tell
betty
reynolds
almost
as
eager
and
interested
as
helen
herself
conducted
their
daily
lives
with
an
eye
always
alert
as
to
what
would
be
best
for
helen
and
betty
teachers
for
gladys
and
betty
were
teachers
for
helen
too
and
carefully
reynolds
made
it
a
point
that
her
own
social
friends
should
also
be
helen
which
helen
accepted
with
unruffled
cheerfulness
helen
indeed
had
now
almost
reached
the
goal
long
ago
set
for
her
by
thayer
it
was
very
nearly
a
matter
of
supreme
indifference
to
her
whether
she
met
people
or
not
so
far
as
the
idea
of
meeting
them
was
concerned
there
came
a
day
however
when
for
a
moment
helen
almost
yielded
to
her
old
temptation
they
were
back
in
london
and
it
was
near
the
close
of
helen
third
year
abroad
i
met
donald
estey
this
morning
said
reynolds
at
the
luncheon
table
that
noon
i
asked
him
to
dine
with
us
night
he
is
here
for
the
winter
so
good
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
estey
commented
her
husband
once
helen
would
have
given
a
cry
dropped
her
fork
with
a
clatter
or
otherwise
made
her
startled
perturbation
conspicuous
to
all
that
only
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
and
a
slight
change
of
color
resulted
now
showed
something
of
what
helen
denby
had
learned
during
the
last
few
years
you
say
donald
estey
will
be
here
she
asked
quietly
yes
you
remember
him
nodded
reynolds
he
was
at
the
at
the
same
time
i
was
there
six
years
ago
tall
fellow
with
glasses
yes
i
remember
smiled
helen
and
never
would
one
have
imagined
that
behind
the
quiet
words
was
a
wild
clamor
of
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
what
i
do
what
helen
denby
wanted
to
do
was
to
run
away
far
away
where
donald
estey
could
never
find
her
next
best
would
be
to
tell
reynolds
that
she
could
not
see
him
but
to
do
that
she
would
have
to
tell
why
and
she
did
not
want
to
tell
even
reynolds
the
story
of
that
awful
hour
at
the
thayers
north
shore
cottage
true
she
might
feign
illness
and
plead
a
headache
but
reynolds
had
said
that
estey
was
to
be
in
london
all
winter
and
she
could
not
very
well
have
a
headache
all
winter
there
was
plainly
no
way
but
to
meet
this
thing
fairly
and
squarely
besides
had
not
thayer
said
long
ago
that
emergencies
were
the
greatest
test
of
manners
as
well
as
of
ropes
and
housewives
and
that
she
must
always
be
ready
for
emergencies
was
she
to
fail
now
at
this
her
first
real
test
donald
estey
was
already
in
the
when
helen
denby
came
down
to
dinner
the
following
evening
she
had
put
on
a
simple
white
dress
after
a
horrified
rejection
of
a
blue
one
her
first
choice
she
had
remembered
just
in
time
that
donald
estey
favorite
color
was
blue
she
was
pale
but
she
looked
charmingly
pretty
as
she
entered
the
room
you
remember
estey
reynolds
murmured
the
next
moment
helen
found
her
hand
in
a
warm
clasp
and
a
pair
of
laughing
gray
eyes
looking
straight
into
hers
oh
yes
i
remember
him
very
well
she
contrived
to
say
cheerfully
and
i
remember
mrs
darling
very
well
came
to
her
ears
in
donald
estey
smoothly
noncommittal
voice
then
she
forced
herself
to
walk
calmly
across
the
room
and
to
sit
down
leisurely
what
anybody
said
next
she
did
not
hear
somewhere
within
her
a
voice
was
exulting
i
done
it
i
done
it
and
i
did
make
a
break
it
was
a
small
table
and
conversation
at
dinner
was
general
at
first
helen
said
little
not
trusting
herself
to
speak
unless
a
question
made
speech
imperative
but
gradually
she
found
the
tense
something
within
her
relaxing
she
was
able
then
to
talk
more
freely
and
before
the
dinner
was
over
she
was
apparently
quite
her
usual
self
as
to
donald
estey
donald
estey
was
piqued
and
surprised
but
mightily
interested
half
his
anticipated
pleasure
in
this
dinner
had
been
the
fact
that
he
was
to
see
mrs
darling
again
she
would
blush
and
stammer
and
be
adorably
embarrassed
of
course
he
had
not
forgotten
how
distractingly
pretty
she
was
when
she
blushed
he
would
like
to
see
her
blush
again
but
here
she
was
and
she
had
not
blushed
at
all
what
had
happened
a
cool
little
woman
in
a
cool
little
gown
had
put
a
cool
little
hand
in
his
with
a
cool
oh
yes
i
remember
him
very
well
and
that
was
all
yet
she
was
the
same
mrs
darling
that
he
had
met
six
years
before
and
that
had
but
was
she
the
same
really
the
same
mrs
darling
could
never
have
carried
off
a
meeting
like
this
with
such
sweet
serenity
he
wondered
donald
estey
was
still
trying
to
pigeonhole
the
women
he
met
donald
estey
found
frequent
opportunity
for
studying
his
friend
during
the
days
that
followed
for
they
were
much
together
in
reynolds
eyes
he
made
a
very
convenient
fourth
for
a
trip
or
a
concert
and
she
often
asked
him
to
join
them
also
he
made
an
even
more
convenient
escort
for
herself
and
helen
when
as
often
happened
reynolds
was
unable
to
accompany
them
in
one
way
and
another
therefore
he
was
thrown
often
with
this
somewhat
baffling
young
woman
who
refused
to
be
catalogued
the
very
fact
that
he
still
could
not
place
her
made
him
more
persistent
than
ever
besides
to
himself
he
owned
that
he
found
her
very
charming
and
very
charming
all
the
time
there
was
never
on
his
part
now
that
old
feeling
of
aversion
of
which
he
used
to
be
conscious
at
times
and
she
was
always
quite
the
lady
he
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
thought
her
anything
else
true
on
that
remarkable
occasion
six
years
before
she
had
said
something
about
learning
how
to
please
but
he
was
trying
to
forget
that
scene
he
did
not
believe
that
everything
was
quite
straight
about
that
extraordinary
occasion
there
must
have
been
in
some
way
a
mistake
he
did
not
believe
anyway
that
it
signified
at
all
events
he
was
not
going
to
worry
about
a
dead
and
gone
past
like
that
donald
estey
was
not
the
only
one
that
was
trying
to
forget
that
occasion
helen
herself
was
putting
it
behind
her
whenever
the
thought
of
it
entered
her
head
thinking
of
it
brought
embarrassment
and
she
did
not
like
to
feel
embarrassed
she
believed
that
he
was
trying
to
show
that
he
had
forgotten
it
and
if
he
were
disposed
to
forget
the
ridiculous
affair
surely
she
should
be
more
than
glad
to
do
it
and
she
considered
it
very
fine
of
him
very
fine
indeed
she
liked
him
too
she
liked
him
very
much
and
she
enjoyed
being
with
him
and
there
could
be
no
harm
now
either
in
being
with
him
all
she
liked
for
he
could
never
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
she
cared
for
him
particularly
he
understood
that
she
loved
some
one
else
they
might
be
as
friendly
as
they
pleased
there
could
never
thank
heaven
be
any
misunderstanding
about
their
relationship
confidently
serene
therefore
helen
denby
enjoyed
to
the
full
the
stimulus
of
donald
estey
companionship
then
abruptly
her
house
of
cards
tumbled
about
her
ears
mrs
darling
will
you
marry
me
the
man
asked
one
day
he
spoke
lightly
so
lightly
that
she
could
not
believe
him
serious
yet
she
gave
him
a
startled
glance
before
she
answered
estey
please
do
jest
i
not
jesting
i
in
earnest
will
you
marry
me
estey
she
could
only
gasp
her
dismay
you
seem
surprised
he
was
still
smiling
but
you
ca
you
ca
be
in
earnest
mr
estey
why
not
pray
why
you
know
you
must
remember
what
i
i
told
you
six
years
ago
the
red
suffused
her
face
you
mean
that
you
cared
for
some
one
else
he
spoke
gravely
now
the
smile
was
quite
gone
from
his
eyes
but
mrs
darling
it
just
there
that
i
ca
believe
in
earnest
besides
that
was
six
years
ago
but
i
am
in
earnest
and
it
the
same
she
urged
feverishly
oh
estey
please
please
do
let
spoil
our
friendship
this
way
i
thought
you
understood
i
supposed
of
course
you
understood
that
i
i
loved
some
one
else
very
much
but
mrs
darling
you
said
that
six
years
ago
and
and
you
still
free
naturally
no
man
would
be
such
a
fool
as
to
let
so
i
thought
of
course
that
you
had
had
he
came
to
a
helpless
pause
the
color
swept
her
face
again
but
i
told
you
then
that
i
was
was
learning
was
trying
to
learn
oh
why
do
you
make
me
say
it
he
glanced
at
her
face
then
jerked
himself
to
his
feet
angrily
oh
come
come
mrs
darling
you
do
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
now
are
still
trying
to
learn
to
please
as
you
call
it
some
mythically
impossible
man
he
not
mythically
impossible
he
real
then
he
blind
deaf
and
dumb
i
suppose
donald
estey
voice
was
still
wrathful
in
spite
of
herself
helen
denby
laughed
no
no
oh
no
he
suddenly
her
face
grew
grave
and
very
earnest
estey
i
ca
tell
you
you
would
understand
if
you
you
care
anything
for
me
you
will
not
question
me
any
more
i
tell
you
please
please
do
say
any
more
but
donald
estey
did
say
more
a
little
more
he
did
not
say
much
for
the
piteous
pleading
in
the
blue
eyes
stayed
half
the
words
on
his
lips
before
they
were
uttered
in
the
end
he
went
away
with
a
baffled
hurt
pain
in
his
own
eyes
and
helen
did
not
see
him
again
for
some
days
but
he
came
back
in
time
the
pain
still
lurked
in
his
eyes
but
there
was
a
resolute
smile
on
his
lips
if
you
permit
i
want
things
to
be
as
they
were
before
he
told
her
i
still
your
friend
and
i
hope
you
are
mine
why
of
course
of
course
she
stammered
only
i
you
as
she
hesitated
plainly
disturbed
he
raised
a
quick
hand
of
protest
do
worry
his
resolute
smile
became
almost
gay
you
see
how
good
a
friend
i
can
be
if
donald
estey
was
hoping
to
take
by
strategy
the
citadel
that
had
refused
to
surrender
he
gave
no
sign
as
the
days
came
and
went
he
was
clearly
and
consistently
the
good
friend
he
had
said
he
would
be
and
helen
denby
found
no
cause
to
complain
or
to
fear
untoward
results
and
so
the
winter
passed
and
spring
came
and
it
was
on
a
beautiful
day
in
early
spring
that
helen
took
betty
now
nine
years
old
to
one
of
london
most
famous
there
was
to
be
an
auction
shortly
of
a
very
valuable
collection
of
books
and
curios
and
the
advertising
catalogue
sent
to
reynolds
had
fallen
into
helen
hands
it
was
no
new
thing
for
helen
to
haunt
and
given
over
to
babylonian
tablets
and
egyptian
scarabs
helen
had
never
forgotten
the
little
brown
and
yellow
which
were
so
treasured
by
burke
and
his
father
and
of
which
she
had
been
so
jealous
in
the
old
days
at
dalton
at
every
opportunity
now
she
studied
them
she
wanted
to
know
something
about
them
but
especially
she
wanted
betty
to
know
about
them
betty
must
know
something
about
everything
that
was
of
interest
to
burke
denby
standing
with
betty
before
a
glass
case
of
carefully
numbered
treasures
she
was
so
assiduously
studying
the
catalogue
in
her
hand
that
she
did
not
notice
the
approach
of
the
tall
man
wearing
glasses
until
an
amused
voice
reached
her
ears
going
in
for
archæology
mrs
darling
so
violent
was
her
start
that
it
looked
almost
like
one
of
guilt
oh
estey
i
i
did
see
you
his
eyes
twinkled
i
should
say
not
or
hear
me
either
i
spoke
twice
before
you
deigned
to
turn
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
interested
in
archæology
mrs
darling
she
laughed
lightly
i
not
i
think
it
her
face
changed
suddenly
oh
yes
interested
very
much
interested
she
corrected
hastily
but
i
mean
i
i
do
know
anything
about
it
but
i
i
trying
to
learn
perhaps
you
you
tell
me
anything
about
these
things
something
in
her
face
the
fateful
learn
and
her
embarrassed
manner
sent
his
thoughts
back
to
the
scene
between
them
years
before
stifling
an
almost
uncontrollable
impulse
to
query
is
it
to
please
then
that
you
must
learn
archæology
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
shook
his
head
i
afraid
not
he
smiled
oh
i
know
a
something
of
them
it
true
but
i
just
been
chatting
with
a
man
out
in
the
front
shop
who
could
talk
to
you
by
the
hour
about
those
things
and
grow
fat
on
it
he
looking
at
a
toby
jug
now
shall
i
bring
him
in
no
no
estey
of
course
not
but
really
you
find
him
interesting
i
sure
i
met
him
in
egypt
last
year
his
name
is
denby
a
new
englander
like
why
mrs
darling
what
is
the
matter
are
you
faint
you
white
as
chalk
she
shook
her
head
no
no
i
all
right
did
you
mean
with
white
lips
she
asked
the
question
john
denby
she
threw
a
quick
look
at
betty
who
was
now
halfway
across
the
room
standing
in
awed
wonder
before
a
huge
buddha
no
this
is
burke
denby
john
denby
son
i
met
them
both
last
year
but
you
seem
to
do
you
know
them
yes
she
said
the
word
quietly
yet
with
an
odd
restraint
that
puzzled
him
he
saw
that
the
color
was
coming
back
to
her
face
what
he
could
not
see
or
know
was
that
underneath
that
calm
exterior
the
little
woman
at
his
side
was
wildly
adjuring
herself
now
mind
mind
this
is
an
emergency
mind
you
meet
it
right
he
saw
that
she
took
one
quick
step
toward
betty
only
to
stop
and
look
about
her
a
little
uncertainly
estey
she
was
facing
him
now
her
chin
was
lifted
determinedly
but
he
noticed
that
her
lips
were
trembling
i
do
not
want
to
see
burke
denby
and
he
see
me
there
is
no
way
out
of
this
place
apparently
except
through
the
front
shop
where
he
is
i
want
you
to
go
out
there
and
and
talk
to
him
then
betty
and
i
can
slip
by
unnoticed
but
but
stammered
the
dumfounded
man
estey
you
do
what
i
ask
you
to
and
please
go
he
sure
to
come
out
to
see
these
she
just
touched
the
case
of
babylonian
tablets
to
the
man
looking
into
her
anguished
eyes
came
a
swift
overwhelming
revelation
he
remembered
suddenly
stories
he
had
heard
of
a
tragedy
in
burke
denby
domestic
affairs
he
remembered
words
illuminating
words
that
this
woman
had
said
to
him
it
could
not
be
and
yet
he
caught
his
breath
is
he
are
you
i
am
burke
denby
she
interrupted
quietly
you
will
not
betray
me
i
know
now
will
you
go
please
for
one
appalled
instant
he
gazed
straight
into
her
eyes
then
without
a
word
he
turned
and
left
her
he
knew
a
minute
later
that
he
was
saying
something
he
wondered
afterward
what
it
was
to
burke
denby
out
in
the
main
shop
he
knew
too
without
looking
up
that
a
woman
and
a
little
girl
passed
quietly
by
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
disappeared
through
the
open
doorway
then
dazedly
donald
estey
looked
about
him
he
was
wondering
if
after
all
he
had
not
been
dreaming
that
evening
he
learned
that
it
was
not
a
dream
freely
and
with
a
frank
confidence
that
touched
him
deeply
the
woman
he
had
known
as
mrs
darling
told
him
the
whole
story
he
heard
it
with
naturally
varying
emotions
he
tried
to
be
just
to
be
coolly
unprejudiced
he
tried
also
to
hide
his
own
heartache
he
even
tried
to
be
glad
that
she
loved
her
husband
as
she
so
unmistakably
did
and
you
tell
him
now
of
course
where
you
are
he
said
when
she
had
finished
no
no
i
ca
do
that
but
do
you
think
that
is
right
i
am
sure
it
is
but
if
your
husband
wants
you
he
does
want
me
are
you
sure
very
sure
a
curious
look
came
to
the
man
eyes
a
grim
smile
to
his
lips
er
he
hesitated
a
little
you
do
want
to
forget
that
er
you
have
long
ago
qualified
for
that
you
remember
that
wanted
you
the
rich
color
that
flamed
into
her
face
told
that
she
fully
understood
what
he
meant
yet
she
shook
her
head
vehemently
no
no
ah
please
do
jest
about
that
i
was
very
much
in
earnest
indeed
i
was
and
i
thought
then
that
i
really
could
could
but
i
understand
lots
of
things
now
that
i
never
understood
before
it
is
really
all
for
betty
that
i
am
working
now
i
want
to
make
what
he
would
want
her
to
be
nonsense
my
dear
woman
as
if
you
yourself
were
not
the
most
she
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
her
eyes
had
grown
very
serious
i
do
want
you
to
talk
that
way
please
i
would
rather
think
just
of
betty
but
what
about
him
i
do
know
her
eyes
grew
fathomless
she
turned
them
toward
the
window
of
course
i
think
and
think
and
think
and
of
course
i
wonder
how
it
all
coming
out
i
sure
i
doing
right
now
and
i
think
i
was
doing
right
then
then
when
i
went
away
at
the
first
i
ca
see
how
i
could
have
done
anything
else
as
things
were
some
way
all
along
i
felt
as
if
i
were
traveling
a
a
long
road
and
that
on
each
side
was
a
tall
hedge
i
ca
look
over
it
nor
through
it
i
ca
even
look
ahead
very
far
the
road
turns
so
often
but
there
have
never
been
any
crossroads
there
never
been
any
other
way
i
could
take
as
i
looked
at
it
do
you
see
mr
estey
yes
i
think
i
see
the
old
baffled
pain
had
come
back
to
his
eyes
but
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
her
gaze
had
drifted
back
to
the
window
and
so
i
feel
that
now
i
still
on
that
road
and
that
leading
somewhere
and
some
day
i
shall
know
until
then
there
anything
i
can
do
do
you
see
there
is
anything
i
can
do
but
to
keep
straight
ahead
there
really
is
mr
estey
no
i
suppose
there
is
said
donald
estey
rising
to
his
feet
with
a
long
sigh
chapter

pink
teas
to
flighty
blondes
one
by
one
the
years
slipped
by
swiftly
with
little
change
in
boston
the
doctor
trying
not
to
count
them
still
had
not
forgotten
from
helen
through
his
sister
came
glowing
accounts
of
concerts
lectures
travels
and
for
herself
and
betty
from
dalton
both
directly
and
indirectly
began
to
come
reports
of
a
new
gayety
at
the
old
denby
mansion
dinners
and
and
even
a
ball
or
two
figured
in
the
reports
vexed
and
curious
the
doctor
who
had
of
late
refused
most
of
his
invitations
to
dalton
took
occasion
between
certain
trips
of
his
own
to
go
up
to
the
little
town
to
see
for
himself
the
meaning
of
this
to
him
unaccountable
phase
of
the
situation
there
was
a
big
reception
at
denby
mansion
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
his
arrival
the
hotel
parlor
and
office
were
abuzz
with
stories
of
the
guests
decorations
and
city
caterer
there
came
to
the
doctor
ears
too
sundry
rumors
some
vague
others
unpleasantly
explicit
concerning
a
pretty
little
blonde
widow
who
was
being
frequently
seen
these
days
in
the
company
of
burke
denby
the
son
of
course
he
have
to
get
a
divorce
but
he
could
do
that
easy
overheard
the
doctor
in
the
corridor
his
wife
ran
away
did
she
years
ago
i
heard
she
did
uninvited
and
unheralded
the
doctor
attended
the
reception
passing
up
the
old
familiar
walk
he
came
to
an
unfamiliar
garish
blaze
of
lights
a
riot
of
color
and
perfume
a
din
of
shrieking
violins
the
swish
of
silken
skirts
and
the
peculiarly
inane
babble
that
comes
from
a
multitude
of
chattering
tongues
gorgeous
lackeys
reached
unfamiliar
hands
for
his
hat
and
coat
and
the
doctor
was
nearly
ready
to
turn
and
flee
the
delirium
of
horror
when
he
suddenly
almost
laughed
aloud
at
sight
of
the
wholly
disgusted
face
of
benton
at
that
moment
the
old
manservant
eyes
met
his
own
and
the
doctor
eyes
grew
suddenly
moist
at
the
beatific
joy
which
illumined
that
harassed
anxious
old
face
regardless
of
the
trailing
silks
and
billowing
tulle
between
them
benton
leaped
to
his
side
praise
be
if
it
ai
dr
gleason
he
exulted
incoherent
but
beaming
yes
but
what
is
this
benton
laughed
the
doctor
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
the
old
butler
rolled
his
eyes
blest
if
i
know
sir
indeed
i
do
but
i
thinking
it
gone
crazy
i
am
and
sometimes
i
think
maybe
the
master
and
young
master
burke
too
are
going
crazy
with
me
i
do
sir
i
can
well
imagine
it
benton
smiled
the
doctor
dryly
as
he
began
to
make
his
way
toward
the
big
where
john
denby
and
his
son
were
receiving
their
guests
the
doctor
could
find
no
cause
to
complain
of
his
welcome
it
was
cordial
and
manifestly
sincere
he
was
introduced
at
once
as
an
old
and
valued
friend
and
he
soon
found
himself
the
center
of
a
plainly
admiring
group
it
was
very
evidently
soon
whispered
about
that
he
was
frank
gleason
of
archæological
and
arctic
fame
and
his
only
difficulty
after
his
first
introduction
was
to
find
any
time
for
his
own
observations
and
reflections
he
contrived
however
in
spite
of
his
embarrassing
popularity
to
see
something
of
his
hosts
he
talked
with
them
when
possible
and
he
watched
them
with
growingly
troubled
eyes
many
times
that
evening
he
saw
the
mask
drop
over
john
denby
face
twice
he
saw
a
slow
turning
away
as
of
ineffable
weariness
once
he
saw
a
spasm
as
of
pain
twitch
his
lips
and
he
noted
the
quick
involuntary
lifting
of
his
hand
to
his
side
he
saw
that
usually
however
the
master
of
denby
house
stood
tall
and
straight
and
handsome
with
the
cordial
genial
smile
of
a
perfect
host
as
to
burke
it
was
when
the
doctor
was
watching
burke
that
the
trouble
in
his
eyes
grew
deepest
true
on
burke
face
there
was
no
mask
of
inscrutability
in
his
eyes
was
no
weariness
on
his
lips
no
quick
spasm
of
pain
he
was
gay
alert
handsome
and
apparently
happy
nevertheless
the
frown
on
the
doctor
face
did
not
diminish
there
was
a
look
of
too
much
wine
slight
perhaps
but
unmistakable
on
burke
denby
face
that
the
doctor
did
not
like
the
doctor
also
did
not
like
the
way
burke
devoted
himself
to
the
blonde
young
woman
who
was
so
eternally
at
his
elbow
this
was
the
widow
of
course
the
doctor
surmised
this
at
once
besides
he
had
met
her
her
name
was
carrolton
and
carrolton
was
the
name
he
had
heard
so
frequently
in
the
hotel
the
doctor
did
not
like
the
looks
of
carrolton
she
was
beautiful
undeniably
in
a
way
but
her
blue
eyes
were
shifting
and
her
mouth
when
in
repose
had
hard
lines
she
was
not
the
type
of
woman
he
liked
to
have
burke
with
and
he
would
not
have
supposed
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
that
burke
himself
would
care
for
and
to
see
him
now
hanging
upon
her
every
word
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
the
doctor
turned
his
back
and
stalked
to
the
farther
side
of
the
room
much
to
the
surprise
of
a
vapid
young
woman
to
whom
he
remembered
when
it
was
too
late
he
had
been
supposed
to
be
talking
a
little
later
in
the
where
he
had
passed
so
many
restful
hours
with
burke
and
his
father
about
the
softly
lighted
table
the
doctor
now
in
the
midst
of
a
chattering
thronging
multitude
attempted
to
keep
his
own
balance
and
that
of
a
tiny
wobbly
plate
intermittently
heaped
with
salads
sandwiches
cakes
and
creams
which
he
was
supposed
to
eat
but
which
he
momentarily
and
terrifyingly
expected
to
deposit
upon
a
silken
gown
or
a
spotless
the
doctor
was
one
of
the
first
of
john
denby
guests
to
make
his
adieus
he
had
decided
suddenly
that
he
must
get
away
quite
away
from
the
sight
of
burke
and
the
little
widow
otherwise
he
should
say
something
a
very
strong
something
and
for
obvious
reasons
he
really
could
say
nothing
disgusted
frightened
annoyed
and
aggrieved
he
went
home
the
next
morning
to
his
sister
he
said
much
he
could
talk
to
his
sister
he
gave
first
a
full
account
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
in
dalton
omitting
not
one
detail
then
wrathfully
he
reproached
her
so
you
see
what
come
of
your
foolishness
burke
is
building
bridges
for
the
hottentots
now
he
giving
pink
teas
to
flighty
blondes
thayer
laughed
softly
but
that
only
another
way
of
trying
to
get
away
from
himself
frank
she
argued
yes
but
i
notice
he
is
trying
to
get
away
from
the
widow
he
snapped
a
disturbed
frown
came
to
the
lady
face
i
know
she
bit
her
lips
i
am
a
little
worried
at
that
frank
own
i
wondered
often
if
if
there
was
ever
any
danger
of
something
like
that
happening
well
you
would
wonder
any
longer
if
you
should
see
nellie
carrolton
observed
the
doctor
with
terse
significance
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
sharply
the
doctor
spoke
again
i
going
to
write
to
helen
oh
frank
i
am
i
got
to
i
do
think
it
right
not
to
but
what
shall
you
tell
her
that
she
better
come
home
and
look
after
her
property
if
she
does
she
likely
to
lose
it
that
what
i
going
to
tell
her
oh
frank
murmured
his
distressed
sister
again
but
she
made
no
further
demur
and
that
night
the
letter
went
in
due
course
came
the
answer
it
was
short
but
very
much
to
the
point
the
doctor
read
it
and
said
a
sharp
something
behind
his
teeth
without
another
word
he
handed
the
note
to
his
sister
and
this
is
what
she
read
he
is
my
property
i
ca
lose
him
for
i
have
him
to
lose
he
took
himself
away
from
me
years
ago
if
ever
i
to
win
him
back
i
must
win
him
not
compel
him
if
he
thinks
he
found
some
one
else
all
the
more
reason
why
i
come
back
now
until
he
knows
whether
he
wants
her
or
not
but
if
i
came
now
and
he
should
want
her
really
gleason
i
do
want
the
same
man
to
tell
me
twice
to
go
helen
just
about
what
i
expected
she
say
commented
the
sister
tranquilly
as
she
laid
the
letter
down
oh
you
women
flung
out
the
doctor
springing
to
his
feet
and
turning
wrathfully
on
his
heel
the
doctor
was
relieved
but
not
wholly
eased
in
his
mind
some
days
later
when
he
heard
indirectly
that
denby
mansion
was
closed
and
that
the
denbys
were
off
again
to
some
remote
corner
of
the
world
well
anyhow
the
widow
is
with
him
now
he
comforted
himself
aloud
building
bridges
for
the
hottentots
again
smiled
his
sister
yes
australia
this
time
that
nice
and
far
mused
the
lady
oh
yes
it
far
all
right
growled
the
doctor
somewhat
belligerently
anyhow
it
too
far
for
the
widow
thank
heaven
the
doctor
went
himself
far
before
the
month
was
out
already
his
plans
were
made
for
a
six
months
trip
with
a
research
party
to
his
pet
the
grotto
land
of
northern
spain
once
more
the
calmness
of
silence
and
absence
left
edith
thayer
with
only
helen
denby
occasional
letters
to
remind
her
of
burke
denby
and
his
matrimonial
problem
chapter
xviii
a
little
bunch
of
diaries
it
was
three
years
before
the
doctor
went
up
to
dalton
again
it
was
on
a
sad
errand
this
time
john
denby
had
died
suddenly
and
after
an
hour
hesitation
the
doctor
went
up
to
the
funeral
there
were
no
garish
lights
and
shrieking
violins
to
greet
him
as
he
passed
once
more
up
the
long
familiar
walk
the
warm
september
sun
touched
lovingly
the
old
brass
knocker
and
peeped
behind
the
stately
colonial
pillars
of
the
long
veranda
it
gleamed
for
a
moment
on
the
bald
heads
of
the
men
filing
slowly
through
the
wide
doorway
and
it
tried
to
turn
to
silver
the
sable
crape
hanging
at
the
right
of
the
door
not
until
that
evening
after
the
funeral
did
the
doctor
have
the
opportunity
for
more
than
a
formal
word
of
greeting
and
sympathy
with
burke
denby
he
had
been
shocked
in
the
afternoon
at
the
changes
in
the
young
man
face
but
he
was
more
so
when
at
eight
he
called
at
the
house
he
found
burke
alone
in
the
library
the
library
whose
every
book
and
chair
and
curio
spoke
with
the
voice
of
the
man
who
was
gone
the
man
who
had
loved
them
so
well
burke
himself
to
the
doctor
looked
suddenly
old
and
worn
and
infinitely
weary
of
life
he
did
not
at
once
speak
of
his
father
but
when
he
did
speak
of
him
a
little
later
he
seemed
then
to
want
to
talk
of
nothing
else
things
that
his
father
had
done
and
said
his
little
ways
his
likes
and
dislikes
the
hours
of
delight
they
had
passed
together
the
trips
they
had
taken
even
the
tiddledywinks
and
mother
goose
of
childhood
came
in
for
their
share
on
and
on
until
far
into
the
night
he
talked
and
the
doctor
listened
with
a
word
now
and
then
of
sympathy
or
appreciation
but
with
a
growing
ache
in
his
heart
you
have
been
indeed
a
wonderful
father
and
son
he
said
at
last
unsteadily
there
was
never
another
like
us
the
son
voice
was
very
low
there
was
a
moment
silence
the
doctor
his
beseeching
eyes
on
the
younger
man
face
was
groping
in
his
mind
for
the
right
words
to
introduce
the
subject
which
all
the
evening
had
been
at
the
door
of
his
lips
helen
he
felt
that
now
with
burke
softened
heart
to
lend
lenience
and
with
his
lonely
life
in
prospect
to
plead
the
need
of
companionship
was
the
time
if
ever
that
an
appeal
for
helen
might
be
successful
but
the
right
words
of
introduction
had
not
come
to
him
when
burke
himself
began
to
speak
again
and
it
almost
as
if
i
lost
both
father
and
mother
he
went
on
brokenly
for
dad
talked
so
much
of
mother
to
him
she
was
always
with
us
i
think
i
can
remember
when
i
was
a
little
boy
how
real
she
was
to
me
in
all
we
did
or
said
she
seemed
to
have
a
part
and
always
all
the
way
up
he
used
to
talk
of
her
except
for
the
time
when
he
stopped
abruptly
the
doctor
watching
wondered
at
the
white
compression
that
came
suddenly
to
his
lips
in
a
moment
it
was
gone
however
and
he
had
resumed
speaking
of
late
years
dad
has
seemed
to
talk
more
than
ever
of
mother
and
he
spoke
always
as
if
she
were
with
us
and
now
i
alone
so
utterly
alone
gleason
how
ever
am
i
going
to
live
without
dad
the
doctor
heart
leaped
with
mingled
fear
and
elation
fear
at
what
he
was
about
to
do
elation
that
his
chance
to
do
it
had
come
he
cleared
his
throat
and
began
courageously
though
not
quite
steadily
but
there
your
wife
burke
if
only
you
he
stopped
short
in
dismay
at
the
look
that
had
come
into
burke
denby
face
my
wife
my
wife
do
speak
of
my
wife
now
man
if
you
want
me
to
keep
my
reason
the
woman
who
brought
more
sorrow
to
my
father
than
any
other
living
being
what
do
you
think
i
would
give
if
i
could
blot
out
the
memory
of
the
anguish
my
marriage
brought
to
dad
i
can
see
his
eyes
now
when
he
was
pleading
with
me
it
afterwards
do
you
know
what
a
brick
dad
was
afterwards
well
i
tell
you
never
by
so
much
as
a
look
much
less
a
word
has
he
reproached
or
censured
me
at
first
he
he
just
put
up
a
wall
between
us
but
it
was
a
wall
of
grief
and
sore
hurt
it
was
never
anger
i
know
that
now
then
one
day
somehow
i
found
that
wall
down
and
i
looked
straight
into
dad
eyes
it
was
never
there
again
that
wall
i
knew
of
course
that
dad
had
never
forgotten
the
hurt
and
grief
were
still
there
that
i
could
so
disobey
him
disregard
his
wishes
but
he
would
not
let
them
be
a
wall
between
us
any
longer
then
when
it
all
turned
out
as
it
did
but
he
never
once
said
told
you
so
nor
even
looked
it
and
he
was
kind
and
good
to
helen
always
but
when
i
think
how
i
i
who
love
him
so
brought
to
him
all
that
grief
and
anguish
of
heart
i
my
wife
indeed
gleason
i
never
want
to
see
her
face
again
or
hear
her
name
spoken
but
your
your
child
stammered
the
dismayed
doctor
faintly
a
shadow
of
quick
pain
crossed
the
other
face
i
know
and
that
another
thing
that
grieved
dad
he
was
fond
of
his
little
granddaughter
he
used
to
speak
of
her
often
till
i
begged
him
not
to
she
mine
of
course
but
she
helen
too
and
she
is
being
brought
up
by
helen
not
me
i
can
imagine
what
she
being
taught
about
her
father
he
finished
bitterly
oh
but
i
sure
i
know
she
with
a
painful
color
the
doctor
suddenly
warned
from
within
just
in
time
came
to
a
frightened
pause
burke
however
lifting
a
protesting
hand
changed
the
subject
abruptly
and
the
relieved
doctor
was
glad
for
once
not
to
have
him
wish
to
talk
longer
of
his
missing
wife
and
daughter
very
soon
the
doctor
said
and
left
the
house
but
his
heart
was
heavy
perhaps
after
all
he
sighed
to
himself
it
was
just
the
time
to
get
him
to
listen
to
reason
about
helen
when
it
was
his
runaway
marriage
that
had
so
grieved
his
father
years
ago
and
his
father
now
just
gone
from
many
lips
before
he
left
town
the
next
morning
gleason
learned
much
of
the
life
and
doings
of
the
denbys
during
the
past
few
years
perhaps
the
death
of
john
denby
had
made
the
dalton
tongues
garrulous
at
all
events
they
were
nothing
loath
to
talk
and
the
doctor
eager
to
obtain
anything
that
would
enable
him
to
understand
burke
denby
was
nothing
loath
to
listen
yes
sir
he
hai
been
well
for
years
john
denby
hai
related
one
old
man
into
the
doctor
attentive
sympathetic
ears
and
i
sayin
i
wonder
with
all
he
been
through
but
you
said
you
was
a
friend
of
his
did
ye
the
doctor
inclined
his
head
i
am
indeed
an
old
friend
of
the
family
well
it
likely
then
you
know
something
yourself
of
happened
though
you
hai
lived
here
to
see
it
all
first
ye
know
there
was
his
son
marriage
and
that
cut
the
old
man
all
up
runaway
and
not
what
the
family
wanted
at
all
know
that
of
course
but
they
made
the
best
of
it
apparently
after
a
while
and
young
denby
took
hold
at
the
works
right
down
to
the
beginnin
he
went
too
overalls
and
day
wages
and
he
done
well
but
it
must
galled
some
why
once
fur
a
spell
he
worked
my
he
did
the
men
liked
him
too
when
they
got
over
their
grinnin
and
nonsense
and
see
he
was
in
earnest
know
what
a
likely
chap
young
denby
be
when
he
wants
to
none
better
smiled
the
doctor
yes
well
to
resume
and
go
on
somethin
happened
one
day
in
his
domestic
affairs
i
mean
the
pretty
young
wife
and
kid
lit
out
for
parts
unknown
and
the
son
went
back
to
his
dad
he
and
his
dad
always
was
more
like
pals
than
anythin
else
some
says
he
sent
her
away
the
wife
i
mean
some
says
she
runned
away
herself
like
enough
know
the
rights
of
it
there
was
a
suggestion
of
a
pause
and
a
sly
glance
but
at
the
absolute
of
the
other
face
the
narrator
went
on
hastily
well
whatever
was
the
rights
or
wrongs
of
it
she
went
and
been
seen
in
these
parts
since
as
i
know
of
not
that
i
know
her
if
i
did
see
her
howsomever
well
that
was
a
dozen
yes
fourteen
years
ago
i
guess
and
the
old
man
hai
been
the
same
since
he
hai
been
the
same
since
the
boy
marriage
for
that
matter
well
at
first
after
she
went
the
denbys
went
kitin
off
on
one
them
trips
o
theirn
that
they
always
takin
then
they
come
home
and
opened
up
the
old
house
and
things
went
on
about
as
they
used
to
young
denby
was
married
but
the
old
man
fell
sick
first
on
the
trip
then
afterwards
once
or
twice
he
well
but
that
hinder
his
goin
off
again
this
time
they
went
with
one
of
their
bridges
always
before
they
let
henry
or
grosset
manage
the
job
but
this
time
they
went
themselves
after
that
they
went
lots
to
south
america
africa
australia
and
i
do
know
where
they
seemed
restless
and
uneasy
both
of
then
they
begun
ter
bring
folks
home
with
chaps
who
wore
purple
silk
socks
and
neckties
and
looked
as
if
they
never
done
a
stroke
of
work
in
their
lives
and
women
with
high
heels
and
false
hair
my
but
there
was
gay
doin
there
winters
there
was
balls
and
parties
and
swell
feeds
with
nigger
waiters
from
boston
and
even
the
dishes
and
what
they
et
come
from
there
too
sometimes
they
say
summers
they
rode
in
hayracks
and
autymobiles
and
danced
outdoors
on
the
grass
shows
you
know
and
they
was
a
show
with
the
women
barefooted
and
barearmed
and
and
not
much
on
generally
my
wife
seen
once
and
she
was
that
shocked
she
did
get
over
it
for
a
month
she
said
she
was
brought
up
to
keep
a
modest
dress
on
her
that
had
a
decent
waist
and
skirt
to
it
but
my
bill
he
been
in
boston
two
years
now
says
it
a
pageant
and
art
and
all
right
that
you
can
do
it
in
pageants
when
you
ca
just
walkin
along
the
street
runnin
into
the
neighbors
see
i
see
nodded
the
doctor
gravely
oh
well
of
course
they
did
go
like
that
all
the
time
they
played
that
thing
lots
where
they
have
them
little
balls
and
sticks
to
knock
with
they
played
it
all
over
hill
and
the
durgin
pasture
in
old
dalton
and
they
got
my
grandson
to
be
a
a
caddie
hazarded
the
doctor

what
they
called
it
and
he
made
good
money
too
nothin

want
me
for
one
well
as
i
was
sayin
they

all
this
an
more

more
of
it
and
they

hull

sometimes
my
wife
went
and
my
darter
they
said
it
was
fine
and
grand
and
all
that
but
that
they
did
believe
old
john
liked
it
very
well
but
burke
liked
it
that
was
easy
to
be
seen
and
there
was
a
pretty
little
widder
there
lots
and
liked
it
some
said
as
how
they
thought
there
be
a
match
there
sometime
if
he
could
get
free
but
i
guess
there
anythin
ter
that
anyhow
all
of
a
sudden
somethin
happened
everythin
stopped
right
off
short
all
the
gay
doin
and
parties
and
everybody
went
home
then
the
next
thing
we
knew
the
old
house
was
dark
and
empty
again
and
the
denbys
gone
to
australia
with
another
bridge
yes
i
know
i
remember
that
interposed
the
doctor
alert
and
interested
did
you
see
when
they
come
back
no
well
they
did
look
like
the
same
men
and
ever
since
they
been
different
somehow
stern
and
silent
with
never
a
smile
for
anybody
skursley
no
balls
an
parties
now
you
bet
ye
week
in
and
week
out
jest
shut
up
in
that
big
silent
house
never
goin
out
at
all
except
to
the
works
then
we
heard
he
was
sick
john
but
he
got
better
and
was
out
again
the
end
come
sudden
nobody
expected
that
but
he
was
a
good
man
a
grand
good
man
john
denby
was
he
was
indeed
agreed
the
doctor
with
a
long
sigh
as
he
turned
away
this
story
with
here
and
there
a
new
twist
and
turn
the
doctor
heard
on
all
sides
and
always
he
listened
attentively
hopefully
eager
if
possible
to
find
some
detail
that
would
help
him
in
some
further
plea
to
burke
denby
in
behalf
of
the
wife
even
the
women
wanted
to
talk
to
him
and
did
sometimes
to
his
annoyance
once
only
however
did
his
irritation
get
the
better
of
his
manners
it
was
when
the
woman
of
whom
he
bought
his
morning
paper
at
the
station
newsstand
accosted
him
stranger
in
these
parts
ai
ye
come
to
the
did
ye
why
i
thought
so
he
was
a
fine
man
i
still
i
did
think
much
of
him
myself
used
to
know
him
too
well
maybe
used
to
live
next
his
son
same
floor
my
name
cobb
and
i
used
to
see
but
the
doctor
had
turned
on
his
heel
without
even
the
semblance
of
an
apology
ten
minutes
later
he
boarded
the
train
for
boston
to
his
sister
again
he
told
the
story
of
a
dalton
trip
and
as
before
he
omitted
not
one
detail
but
i
ca
write
of
course
to
helen
now
he
finished
gloomily
that
is
i
ca
urge
her
coming
back
not
in
the
face
of
burke
angry
assertion
that
he
never
wants
to
see
her
again
of
course
not
but
do
worry
dear
i
have
given
up
hope
by
any
means
burke
worshiped
his
father
his
heart
is
almost
breaking
now
at
his
loss
it
is
perfectly
natural
under
the
circumstances
that
he
should
have
this
intense
anger
toward
anything
that
ever
grieved
his
loved
father
but
wait
that
all
we
can
do
anyway
i
write
to
helen
of
course
and
tell
her
of
her
death
but
you
would
tell
her
what
burke
said
edith
oh
no
no
indeed
unless
i
to
frank
unless
she
asks
me
but
helen
did
ask
her
by
return
steamer
came
her
letter
expressing
her
shocked
distress
at
john
denby
death
and
asking
timidly
but
urgently
if
in
thayer
opinion
it
were
the
time
now
when
she
should
come
home
if
she
would
be
welcomed
by
her
husband
to
this
of
course
there
was
but
one
answer
possible
and
reluctantly
thayer
gave
it
and
to
think
groaned
the
doctor
that
when
now
for
the
first
time
helen
is
willing
to
come
we
have
to
tell
her
she
ca
i
know
but
edith
thayer
resolutely
blinked
off
the
tears
i
given
up
yet
just
wait
and
the
doctor
waited
it
was
indeed
as
his
sister
said
all
that
he
could
do
from
time
to
time
he
went
up
to
dalton
and
made
his
way
up
the
old
familiar
walk
to
have
a
chat
with
the
taciturn
man
sitting
alone
in
the
great
old
library
the
doctor
never
spoke
of
helen
he
dared
not
take
the
risk
burke
denby
only
interests
plainly
were
business
books
and
the
rare
curios
he
and
his
father
had
collected
a
gowing
a
distant
cousin
had
come
to
be
his
housekeeper
but
the
doctor
saw
little
of
her
she
seemed
to
be
a
quiet
inoffensive
little
woman
plainly
very
much
in
the
background
there
came
an
evening
finally
however
when
much
to
the
beatific
surprise
burke
denby
of
his
own
accord
mentioned
his
wife
it
was
nearly
two
years
after
john
denby
death
the
doctor
had
run
up
to
dalton
for
an
overnight
visit
and
had
noticed
at
once
a
peculiar
restlessness
in
his
host
manner
an
odd
impatience
of
voice
and
gesture
then
abruptly
in
answer
to
the
doctor
own
assertion
that
burke
needed
something
to
get
him
away
from
his
constant
brooding
in
the
old
library
need
something
he
exclaimed
of
course
i
need
something
i
need
my
wife
and
child
i
need
to
live
a
normal
life
like
other
men
i
need
but
what
the
use
he
finished
with
outflung
hands
i
know
but
you
yourself
by
a
supreme
effort
the
doctor
was
keeping
himself
from
shouting
aloud
with
joy
oh
yes
i
know
it
all
my
own
fault
cut
in
burke
crisply
you
ca
tell
me
anything
new
on
that
score
that
i
have
told
myself
yes
and
i
know
i
have
even
been
willing
to
have
her
name
spoken
he
went
on
recklessly
answering
the
amazement
in
the
doctor
face
for
that
matter
i
do
know
why
i
talking
like
this
now
unless
because
i
always
said
to
you
more
than
i
said
to
any
one
else
except
dad
about
helen
and
now
after
being
such
a
cad
it
seems
almost
due
to
her
that
i
should
say
something
besides
somebody
say
somewhere
that
confession
is
good
for
the
soul
there
was
a
quizzical
smile
on
his
lips
but
there
was
no
smile
in
his
eyes
the
doctor
nodded
dumbly
afraid
of
saying
the
wrong
thing
he
dared
not
open
his
lips
but
terrified
at
the
long
silence
that
followed
he
finally
ventured
unsteadily
but
why
this
sudden
change
burke
it
not
so
sudden
as
you
think
burke
eyes
gloomily
fixed
on
the
opposite
wall
did
not
turn
as
he
spoke
it
been
coming
gradually
for
a
long
time
i
can
see
that
now
still
the
real
finally
came
from
mother
mother
yes
her
diary
or
rather
diaries
i
found
them
a
month
ago
among
father
things
i
ca
tell
you
what
was
in
them
i
would
of
course
if
i
could
they
too
sacred
perhaps
you
think
even
i
should
not
have
read
them
perhaps
i
should
but
i
did
and
i
glad
i
did
and
i
believe
she
have
wanted
me
to
of
course
at
first
when
i
picked
one
of
them
up
i
did
know
what
it
was
then
i
saw
my
name
and
i
read
page
after
page
i
was
a
baby
her
baby
gleason
can
you
imagine
what
it
would
be
to
look
deep
down
into
the
soul
of
a
good
woman
and
read
there
all
her
love
hopes
prayers
and
ambitions
for
her
boy
and
then
suddenly
realize
that
you
yourself
were
that
boy
there
was
no
answer
and
burke
evidently
expecting
none
went
on
with
the
rush
of
abandonment
that
told
of
words
suddenly
freed
from
long
restraint
i
took
up
then
the
first
one
the
diary
she
kept
that
first
year
of
her
marriage
and
if
i
had
felt
small
and
mean
and
unworthy
before
on
and
on
i
read
and
as
i
read
i
began
to
see
dimly
what
marriage
means
for
a
woman
they
were
very
poor
then
father
was
the
grandson
of
the
younger
runaway
son
joel
and
had
only
his
trade
and
his
day
wages
they
lived
in
a
shabby
little
cottage
on
mill
street
long
since
destroyed
this
house
belonged
to
the
other
branch
of
the
family
and
was
occupied
by
a
rich
old
man
and
his
daughter
mother
was
gently
reared
and
was
not
used
to
work
those
first
years
of
poverty
and
privation
must
have
been
wickedly
hard
for
her
but
the
little
diaries
carried
no
complaints
they
did
carry
weariness
often
and
sometimes
a
pitiful
terror
lest
she
be
not
strong
enough
for
what
was
before
her
and
so
bring
disappointment
and
grief
to
john
but
always
for
john
i
could
see
there
was
to
be
nothing
but
encouragement
and
a
steadfast
holding
forth
of
high
aims
and
the
assurance
of
ultimate
success
then
one
by
one
came
the
babies
with
all
the
agony
and
fears
and
hopes
they
brought
with
them
three
came
and
slipped
away
into
the
great
unknown
before
i
came
to
stay
about
that
time
father
patents
began
to
bring
success
and
soon
the
money
was
pouring
in
they
bought
this
house
it
had
been
one
of
their
dreams
that
they
would
buy
it
the
old
man
had
died
and
the
daughter
had
married
and
moved
away
and
the
house
had
been
for
sale
for
some
time
so
they
bought
it
and
soon
after
i
was
born
we
came
here
to
live
then
when
i
was
four
years
old
mother
died
that
is
the
story
the
bald
story
but
that
does
tell
you
anything
of
what
those
diaries
were
to
me
in
the
light
they
shed
i
saw
my
own
marriage
and
i
was
ashamed
i
never
thought
of
marriage
before
from
helen
standpoint
i
never
thought
what
she
had
to
suffer
and
endure
and
adapt
herself
to
i
know
now
of
course
very
soon
after
our
marriage
i
realized
that
she
and
i
were
suited
to
each
other
but
what
of
it
i
had
married
her
i
had
effectually
prevented
her
from
finding
happiness
with
any
other
man
yet
it
did
seem
to
occur
to
me
that
i
had
thereby
taken
on
myself
the
irrevocable
duty
of
trying
to
make
her
happy
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
ways
and
aims
and
likes
and
dislikes
annoyed
her
as
much
as
hers
did
me
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
my
soft
greens
and
browns
and
beethoven
harmonies
got
on
her
nerves
just
exactly
as
her
pinks
and
purples
and
ragtime
got
on
mine
i
was
never
in
the
habit
of
looking
at
anybody
happiness
but
my
own
and
was
happy
so
i
let
fling
regardless
burke
paused
and
drew
a
long
sigh
the
doctor
puffing
slowly
at
his
cigar
sedulously
kept
his
face
the
other
way
the
doctor
in
his
fancy
had
already
peopled
the
old
room
with
a
joyous
helen
and
dorothy
elizabeth
and
he
feared
should
he
turn
that
his
face
would
sing
a
veritable
hallelujah
chorus
to
the
consequent
amazement
of
his
host
mother
had
trials
of
her
own
lots
of
them
resumed
burke
after
a
moment
silence
she
even
had
some
not
unlike
mine
i
believe
for
i
think
i
could
read
between
the
lines
that
dad
was
more
than
a
bit
careless
at
times
in
manner
and
speech
compared
to
the
polished
ways
of
the
men
of
her
family
and
social
circle
but
mother
neither
whined
nor
ran
away
she
just
smiled
and
kept
bravely
straight
ahead
and
by
and
by
they
were
under
her
feet
where
they
belonged
all
those
things
that
plagued
but
i
i
both
whined
and
ran
away
because
i
did
like
the
way
my
wife
ate
her
soup
and
spread
her
bread
they
seem
so
small
now
all
those
little
ways
i
hated
small
beside
the
big
things
that
really
counted
do
you
know
i
believe
if
more
people
would
stop
making
the
little
things
big
and
the
big
things
little
there
be
a
whole
heap
more
happiness
lying
around
in
this
old
world
and
helen
poor
helen
she
tried
i
know
she
tried
lots
of
times
when
i
was
reading
in
the
diaries
what
mother
said
about
dad
how
she
must
let
him
get
discouraged
or
downhearted
how
she
must
tell
him
she
just
knew
he
was
going
to
succeed
lots
of
times
then
i
think
of
helen
helen
used
to
talk
that
way
to
me
at
the
first
i
wonder
now
if
helen
kept
a
diary
and
i
ca
help
wondering
if
supposing
i
had
been
a
little
less
apt
to
notice
the
annoyances
and
a
little
more
inclined
to
see
the
good
bah
there
there
old
man
forgive
me
he
broke
off
with
a
shrug
i
did
mean
to
run
on
like
this
i
really
did
for
all
the
world
like
the
advice
to
the
lovelorn
in
a
daily
news
column
i
glad
you
did
burke
the
doctor
carefully
controlled
voice
expressed
cheery
interest
that
was
all
and
now
what
do
you
propose
to
do
do
how
what
do
you
mean
why
about
your
wife
of
course
nothing
there
nothing
i
can
do
and
that
the
pity
of
it
she
will
go
on
of
course
to
the
end
of
her
life
thinking
me
a
cad
and
a
coward
but
if
you
could
be
er
brought
together
again
suggested
the
doctor
in
a
voice
so
coldly
impersonal
it
was
almost
indifferent
oh
yes
of
course
perhaps
but
that
not
likely
i
do
know
where
she
is
remember
and
she
not
likely
to
come
back
of
her
own
accord
after
all
this
time
besides
if
she
did
who
to
guarantee
that
a
few
old
diaries
have
changed
me
from
an
unbearably
selfish
brute
to
a
livably
patient
and
pleasant
person
to
have
about
the
house
not
but
what
i
jump
at
the
chance
to
try
but
well
we
wait
till
i
get
it
he
finished
dryly
with
a
lightness
that
was
plainly
assumed
well
anyway
burke
you
never
found
any
one
else
the
hallelujah
chorus
did
almost
sing
through
the
doctor
voice
this
time
no
i
been
spared
that
thank
heaven
there
was
one
a
mrs
carrolton
yes
i
met
her
at
that
reception
you
know
said
the
doctor
answering
the
unspoken
question
oh
yes
i
remember
well
i
did
come
near
but
i
pulled
myself
up
in
time
i
knew
in
my
heart
she
was
the
kind
of
woman
then
too
there
was
helen
it
was
only
that
i
was
feeling
particularly
reckless
that
fall
besides
i
know
now
that
i
cared
for
helen
the
real
helen
all
the
time
and
there
a
real
helen
i
believe
underneath
it
all
as
i
look
back
at
them
all
those
years
i
know
that
during
every
single
one
of
them
i
been
trying
to
get
away
from
myself
if
it
had
been
for
dad
and
that
the
one
joy
i
have
that
i
was
able
to
be
with
dad
they
were
quite
lost
those
years
for
they
brought
him
joy
no
they
not
been
lost
burke
said
the
doctor
with
quiet
emphasis
burke
laughed
a
little
grimly
oh
i
know
what
you
mean
of
course
i
been
as
by
fire
eh
well
i
dare
say
i
have
and
i
been
found
woefully
wanting
but
enough
of
this
he
broke
off
abruptly
springing
to
his
feet
you
do
happen
to
know
of
a
young
woman
who
has
the
skill
of
experience
the
wisdom
of
age
the
adaptability
of
youth
and
the
patience
of
job
all
in
one
do
you
he
demanded
the
doctor
turned
with
startled
eyes
why
burke
after
all
this
you
do
mean
no
it
not
a
wife
i
looking
for
interposed
burke
with
a
whimsical
shrug
it
a
a
stenographer
or
private
secretary
only
she
must
be
much
more
than
the
ordinary
kind
i
want
to
catalogue
all
this
truck
father
and
i
have
accumulated
she
must
know
french
and
german
a
little
greek
and
hebrew
would
be
amiss
and
i
want
one
that
would
be
interested
in
this
sort
of
thing
one
who
will
realize
she
handling
er
potatoes
say
my
eyes
are
going
back
on
me
too
and
i
shall
want
her
to
read
to
me
so
i
must
like
her
voice
i
do
want
anything
you
see
he
smiled
grimly
i
should
say
not
laughed
the
doctor
rising
but
before
you
can
give
me
any
more
necessary
qualifications
i
guess
i
better
be
going
to
bed
i
do
wonder
after
the
harangue
i
given
you
but
you
do
know
of
such
a
person
do
you
i
do
no
i
suppose
not
nor
anybody
else
finished
burke
denby
a
profound
gloom
that
had
become
habitual
settling
over
his
face
if
i
do
i
send
her
to
you
nodded
the
doctor
halfway
through
the
door
the
doctor
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
up
to
his
room
he
had
a
letter
to
write
thanks
said
burke
denby
still
dryly
as
he
waved
his
hand
in
stenographer
indeed
sang
the
doctor
under
his
breath
bounding
up
the
stairs
like
a
boy
wait
till
he
sees
what
i
am
going
to
get
him
he
finished
striding
down
the
hall
and
into
his
own
room
before
he
slept
the
doctor
wrote
his
letter
to
helen
it
was
a
long
one
and
a
joyous
one
it
told
everything
that
burke
had
said
even
to
his
plaintive
plea
for
a
private
secretary
there
could
be
no
doubt
now
no
further
delay
declared
the
doctor
helen
would
come
home
at
once
of
course
it
only
remained
for
them
to
decide
on
the
mere
details
of
just
how
and
when
meanwhile
when
might
they
expect
her
in
boston
she
would
come
of
course
to
his
first
and
he
trusted
it
would
be
soon
very
soon
addressing
the
letter
to
helen
darling
the
doctor
tucked
it
into
his
pocket
to
be
mailed
at
the
station
in
the
morning
then
for
the
few
hours
before
rising
time
he
laid
himself
down
to
sleep
but
he
did
not
sleep
his
brain
was
altogether
too
actively
picturing
the
arrival
of
helen
denby
and
her
daughter
at
the
old
denby
mansion
and
the
meeting
between
them
and
the
master
of
the
house
and
to
think
that
at
last
it
was
all
coming
out
right
chapter
xix
the
stage
is
set
impatient
as
was
the
doctor
for
an
answer
to
his
letter
it
came
before
he
expected
for
a
cablegram
told
of
helen
almost
immediate
departure
for
america
i
thought
that
would
fetch
her
he
crowed
to
his
sister
and
be
here
just
next
week
wednesday
that
get
her
up
to
dalton
before
sunday
perhaps
observed
thayer
cautiously
no
to
it
declared
the
doctor
if
the
boat
gets
here
you
do
suppose
she
going
to
delay
any
longer
now
do
you
besides
is
she
starting
for
america
about
as
soon
as
she
can
does
that
look
as
if
she
were
losing
much
time
no
it
does
she
admitted
laughingly
the
doctor
and
his
sister
were
not
surprised
to
see
a
very
lovely
and
charming
helen
with
the
distinction
and
mellow
maturity
that
the
dozen
intervening
years
had
brought
her
letters
had
shown
them
something
of
that
but
they
were
not
prepared
for
the
changes
those
same
years
had
wrought
in
dorothy
elizabeth
to
helen
their
frank
start
of
amazement
and
quick
interchange
of
glances
upon
first
sight
of
the
girl
were
like
water
to
a
throat
you
do
think
she
lovely
she
whispered
to
the
frankly
staring
doctor
as
thayer
welcomed
the
young
girl
lovely
she
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
ever
saw
avowed
the
doctor
with
a
laughing
shrug
at
his
own
extravagance
and
she
just
as
sweet
and
dear
as
she
is
lovely
whispered
back
the
adoring
mother
as
the
girl
turned
to
meet
the
doctor
you
your
mother
eyes
my
dear
said
the
doctor
very
much
as
he
had
said
it
to
the
little
betty
years
before
have
i
the
girl
smiled
happily
i
so
glad
i
love
mother
eyes
it
was
not
until
hours
later
when
betty
had
gone
to
bed
that
there
was
any
opportunity
to
talk
over
plans
then
before
the
fire
in
the
library
helen
found
herself
alone
with
the
doctor
and
his
sister
you
see
i
came
almost
as
soon
as
i
could
she
began
at
once
i
did
stay
one
day
for
a
wedding
a
wedding
yes
and
some
one
you
know
too
donald
estey
really
cried
thayer
jove
after
all
this
time
the
doctor
eyebrows
went
up
yes
and
i
so
glad
especially
glad
for
for
he
thought
once
years
ago
that
he
cared
for
some
one
else
and
i
like
to
know
happy
now
murmured
the
doctor
with
a
shrewd
smile
and
a
sidelong
glance
at
his
sister
so
he
happy
eh
oh
very
and
she
a
beautiful
girl
as
beautiful
as
betty
say
the
doctor
voice
was
teasing
a
wonderful
light
came
to
helen
face
you
do
think
she
beautiful
do
you
she
cried
with
a
smile
that
told
she
needed
no
answer
she
a
dear
in
every
way
avowed
thayer
and
to
think
of
all
this
coming
to
burke
denby
without
even
a
turn
of
his
hand
envied
the
doctor
lucky
dog
and
to
get
you
he
does
deserve
it
but
he
is
going
to
get
us
both
helen
eyes
were
twinkling
but
her
mouth
showed
suddenly
firm
lines
the
doctor
wheeled
sharply
what
do
you
mean
surely
you
are
going
to
to
he
stopped
helplessly
he
going
to
get
but
not
me
oh
come
come
helen
my
dear
protested
two
dismayed
voices
but
helen
shook
her
head
decidedly
listen
i
got
it
all
planned
you
said
he
wanted
a
a
sort
of
private
secretary
or
stenographer
did
you
why
well
i
going
to
send
betty
betty
certainly
she
can
fill
the
position
you
need
worry
about
that
she
eighteen
you
know
and
she
really
very
and
capable
she
does
understand
shorthand
of
course
but
she
can
write
his
letters
for
him
just
the
same
and
in
three
or
four
languages
if
he
wants
her
to
she
can
typewrite
reynolds
got
a
typewriter
for
the
girls
long
ago
and
she
to
fuss
over
old
books
and
curios
she
and
gladys
have
spent
days
in
those
old
london
shops
a
real
denby
digger
eh
smiled
the
doctor
yes
and
i
been
so
glad
she
was
interested
like
her
father
but
you
do
mean
you
going
to
give
your
daughter
up
cried
thayer
aghast
and
not
go
yourself
you
could
besides
as
if
burke
would
stand
for
that
cut
in
the
doctor
but
he
is
going
to
know
she
his
daughter
smiled
helen
not
know
she
is
his
daughter
echoed
two
voices
in
stupefaction
no
not
yet
she
be
his
private
secretary
that
is
all
i
relying
on
you
to
er
apply
for
the
situation
for
her
helen
eyes
were
merry
oh
nonsense
this
is
too
absurd
for
words
spluttered
the
doctor
i
do
think
so
his
own
daughter
writing
his
letters
for
him
and
living
with
him
day
by
day
and
he
not
to
know
it
bosh
sounds
like
a
plot
from
a
shilling
shocker
does
it
well
i
ought
not
to
mind
that
ought
i
you
know
was
a
book
in
the
first
place
that
set
me
to
making
myself
and
sir
in
helen
eyes
was
still
twinkling
mischief
oh
but
my
dear
remonstrated
thayer
with
genuine
concern
i
do
think
this
is
impossible
the
expression
on
helen
denby
face
changed
instantly
her
eyes
grew
very
grave
but
luminously
tender
her
lips
trembled
a
little
people
dear
people
if
you
listen
just
a
minute
i
think
i
can
convince
you
she
begged
i
have
it
all
planned
out
betty
and
i
will
go
to
dalton
and
find
a
quiet
little
home
somewhere
oh
i
shall
keep
well
out
of
sight
never
fear
she
nodded
in
reply
to
the
quick
doubt
in
the
doctor
eyes
betty
shall
go
every
morning
to
her
house
and
i
not
afraid
of
betty
he
will
love
her
he
ca
help
it
and
he
will
see
how
dear
and
sweet
and
good
she
is
then
by
and
by
he
shall
know
that
she
is
his
his
very
own
but
but
betty
herself
can
she
act
her
part
in
this
remarkable
scheme
demanded
the
doctor
she
wo
be
acting
a
part
she
just
be
acting
herself
she
is
not
to
know
anything
except
that
she
is
his
secretary
impossible
ejaculated
two
voices
i
do
think
so
anyway
it
worth
trying
and
if
it
works
mean
everything
the
last
word
was
so
low
it
was
scarcely
above
a
whisper
but
yourself
my
dear
pleaded
thayer
where
do
you
come
in
what
part
have
you
in
this
play
the
rich
red
surged
from
neck
to
brow
the
doctor
and
his
sister
could
see
that
though
they
could
not
see
helen
denby
face
it
was
turned
quite
away
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
a
little
breathlessly
came
the
answer
i
do
know
i
suppose
that
will
be
the
wo
it
and
i
never
been
sure
of
the
ending
yet
but
she
hesitated
then
suddenly
she
turned
her
eyes
shining
and
deeply
tender
do
you
see
it
the
only
way
after
all
i
ca
very
well
go
up
to
dalton
and
ring
his
doorbell
and
say
behold
your
wife
and
daughter
wo
you
please
take
us
in
can
i
though
at
first
when
i
heard
of
his
father
death
and
thought
of
him
so
lonely
there
i
did
want
to
do
just
that
but
i
knew
that
was
best
even
before
your
letter
came
telling
me
what
he
said
but
now
why
this
is
just
what
i
wanted
from
the
first
to
show
betty
to
him
some
time
when
he
did
dream
who
she
was
i
wanted
to
that
he
was
ashamed
of
her
and
this
his
wanting
a
secretary
gave
me
a
better
chance
than
i
ever
thought
i
could
have
why
people
dear
people
do
you
see
with
this
i
sha
mind
now
one
bit
all
these
long
long
years
of
waiting
wo
you
help
me
please
i
ca
of
course
do
it
without
your
help
the
doctor
threw
up
both
his
hands
his
old
gesture
of
despair
help
you
of
course
we
help
you
just
as
we
did
before
to
get
the
moon
if
you
ask
for
it
i
feel
like
a
comic
opera
and
a
movie
farce
all
in
one
but
never
mind
i
do
it
now
what
is
it
i
to
do
helen
relaxed
into
such
radiant
joyousness
and
relief
that
she
looked
almost
like
the
girl
burke
denby
had
married
nineteen
years
before
you
dear
i
knew
you
would
she
breathed
yes
but
what
is
it
he
groaned
in
mock
despair
speak
out
i
want
to
know
the
worst
at
once
what
i
to
do
please
you
to
go
up
to
dalton
and
tell
burke
denby
you
think
you
found
a
young
woman
who
will
make
him
an
excellent
secretary
then
if
he
consents
to
try
her
you
to
find
a
little
furnished
apartment
on
a
nice
quiet
street
not
too
far
from
the
denby
mansion
of
course
where
we
can
live
then
i
like
a
note
of
introduction
for
betty
to
take
to
her
father
she
the
daughter
of
an
old
friend
whom
you
known
for
years
see
and
you
are
confident
she
will
give
satisfaction
that
all
now
i
sure
is
all
that
quite
easy
oh
very
easy
very
easy
indeed
replied
the
doctor
with
another
groan
you
little
witch
i
declare
i
believe
you
carry
this
absurd
preposterous
thing
through
to
a
triumphant
finish
after
all
thank
you
i
you
would
fail
me
smiled
helen
with
eyes
but
my
dear
i
do
think
yet
that
everything
is
quite
clear
demurred
thayer
how
about
betty
just
what
does
betty
know
of
her
father
a
look
very
like
fear
crossed
the
bright
face
opposite
she
knows
nothing
of
course
of
of
my
leaving
home
and
the
cause
of
it
never
told
her
anything
of
her
father
except
to
hold
him
up
as
a
symbol
of
everything
good
and
lovable
when
she
was
a
little
girl
you
know
i
could
always
do
anything
with
her
by
just
telling
her
that
daddy
wanted
it
so
but
where
does
she
think
he
is
now
that
she
is
older
she
must
have
asked
some
questions
murmured
thayer
helen
shook
her
head
a
faint
smile
came
to
her
lips
she
has
but
i
been
so
afraid
she
would
and
i
been
dreading
it
always
then
one
day
reynolds
told
me
something
betty
said
to
her
since
then
i
felt
a
little
easier
does
reynolds
know
who
you
really
are
interposed
the
doctor
yes
oh
yes
i
told
her
long
ago
even
before
she
took
me
to
london
with
her
in
fact
i
thought
she
ought
to
know
i
been
so
glad
since
that
i
did
it
saved
me
from
lots
of
awkward
moments
besides
it
enabled
her
to
be
all
the
more
help
to
me
but
what
was
it
betty
said
to
her
asked
thayer
oh
yes
i
did
tell
you
did
i
it
was
this
she
asked
reynolds
one
day
you
ever
know
my
father
and
of
course
reynolds
said
then
betty
said
is
dead
you
know
oh
mother
never
told
me
so
in
words
but
i
understand
that
he
is
of
course
she
just
used
to
say
that
i
must
ask
for
daddy
he
could
be
with
us
now
that
was
all
at
first
when
i
was
little
i
thought
he
was
away
on
a
journey
then
when
i
got
older
i
realized
it
was
just
beautiful
way
of
putting
it
so
now
i
like
to
think
of
him
as
being
just
away
on
a
journey
and
of
i
never
say
anything
to
mother
but
i
do
wish
i
could
have
known
him
he
must
have
been
so
fine
and
splendid
the
dear
child
murmured
thayer
the
doctor
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
over
to
the
window
abruptly
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
softly
helen
said
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
so
you
see
now
i
not
worrying
so
much
for
fear
she
will
question
me
and
i
shall
be
so
happy
by
and
by
when
she
finds
that
daddy
has
been
after
all
only
on
a
journey
edith
thayer
alone
with
her
brother
after
helen
denby
had
gone
upstairs
wiped
her
eyes
it
was
the
doctor
who
spoke
first
if
burke
denby
does
fall
head
over
heels
in
love
with
that
little
woman
and
he
got
the
dearest
treasure
on
earth
i
i
shall
do
it
myself
he
declared
savagely
he
too
was
wiping
his
eyes
his
sister
laughed
tremulously
well
i
am
in
love
with
her
and
i
not
ashamed
to
own
it
she
declared
how
altogether
dear
and
charming
and
winsome
she
is
and
when
you
think
what
these
years
have
done
for
her
chapter
xx
the
curtain
rises
it
was
indeed
quite
easy
surprisingly
so
as
the
doctor
soon
found
out
not
without
some
trepidation
however
had
he
taken
the
train
for
dalton
the
next
morning
and
presented
his
proposition
to
the
master
of
denby
house
i
think
i
found
your
private
secretary
he
began
blithely
hoping
that
his
pounding
did
not
really
sound
like
a
drum
you
have
good
what
her
name
somebody
you
know
questioned
burke
denby
with
a
show
of
interest
yes
she
a
miss
darling
and
i
known
her
family
for
years
the
doctor
gulped
and
swallowed
a
bit
convulsively
the
doctor
was
feeling
that
the
very
walls
of
the
room
must
be
shouting
aloud
his
secret
but
he
kept
bravely
on
she
does
know
shorthand
but
she
can
typewrite
and
she
very
quick
at
taking
dictation
in
long
hand
i
fancy
and
she
knows
several
languages
i
believe
i
sure
you
find
her
capable
and
trustworthy
in
every
way
very
good
sounds
well
sure
smiled
burke
and
here
for
my
needs
speed
and
shorthand
are
not
so
necessary
i
do
only
personal
business
at
the
house
what
salary
does
she
want
so
unexpected
and
disconcerting
was
this
quite
natural
question
that
the
doctor
totally
unprepared
for
it
nearly
betrayed
himself
by
his
confusion
eh
er
ah
oh
great
scott
why
did
they
i
might
have
known
he
floundered
then
sharply
he
recovered
himself
well
really
he
laughed
lightly
i
a
crackerjack
at
applying
for
a
job
and
no
mistake
i
quite
forgot
to
ask
what
salary
she
did
expect
but
i
believe
that
will
matter
materially
she
come
for
what
is
right
sure
and
you
be
willing
to
pay
that
oh
yes
it
does
matter
i
be
glad
to
give
her
a
trial
anyway
and
if
she
all
you
crack
her
up
to
be
i
pay
her
than
right
when
can
she
come
where
does
she
live
well
she
going
to
live
here
in
dalton
evaded
the
doctor
cautiously
she
not
here
yet
but
she
and
her
mother
are
coming
er
next
week
i
believe
better
not
count
on
her
beginning
work
till
the
first
though
perhaps
that
be
next
week
thursday
i
should
think
they
ought
to
be
er
settled
by
that
time
the
doctor
drew
a
long
breath
much
after
the
fashion
of
a
man
who
has
been
crossing
a
bit
of
particularly
thin
ice
all
right
send
her
along
the
sooner
the
better
nodded
burke
the
old
listless
weariness
coming
back
to
his
eyes
i
certainly
need
some
one
oh
well
i
reckon
you
have
some
one
now
caroled
the
doctor
so
jubilantly
that
it
brought
a
frown
of
mild
wonder
to
burke
face
later
the
doctor
still
jubilant
and
confident
hurried
down
the
denby
walk
intent
on
finding
the
modest
little
apartment
for
helen
oh
well
i
do
know
he
exulted
to
himself
wagging
his
head
like
a
cocksure
boy
this
affair
may
not
be
so
bad
after
all
anyhow
i
made
my
first
exit
and
have
spilled
anything
yet
now
for
scene
second
finding
a
satisfactory
little
furnished
apartment
not
too
far
from
the
denby
home
proved
to
be
no
small
task
but
by
sacrificing
a
little
on
the
matter
of
distance
the
doctor
was
finally
enabled
to
engage
one
that
he
thought
would
answer
only
she
have
to
ride
back
and
forth
i
afraid
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
started
for
the
station
to
take
his
train
anyhow
glad
i
did
take
that
one
on
dale
street
she
meet
too
many
ghosts
of
old
memories
on
dale
street
buying
his
paper
at
the
newsstand
in
the
station
the
doctor
himself
encountered
the
ghost
of
a
memory
but
he
could
not
place
it
until
the
woman
behind
the
counter
cried
there
i
thought
i
seen
you
before
you
come
two
years
ago
to
the
denby
now
did
ye
i
tell
ye
it
takes
me
ter
remember
faces
then
as
he
still
frowned
perplexedly
she
explained
do
ye
remember
my
name
cobb
i
used
ter
live
but
the
doctor
had
turned
away
impatiently
he
remembered
now
this
was
the
woman
who
think
much
of
old
denby
herself
on
monday
helen
denby
and
her
daughter
went
to
dalton
at
helen
urgent
insistence
the
doctor
refrained
from
accompanying
them
i
do
want
you
to
be
seen
with
us
helen
had
protested
but
why
not
he
had
argued
rebelliously
i
thought
i
was
a
friend
of
your
family
for
years
i
know
but
i
i
just
feel
that
i
rather
not
have
you
with
us
i
prefer
to
go
alone
please
she
had
begged
and
perforce
he
had
let
her
have
her
own
way
it
was
on
a
beautiful
day
in
late
september
that
helen
denby
and
her
daughter
arrived
at
the
dalton
station
helen
fearful
either
that
her
features
would
be
recognized
or
that
she
would
betray
by
word
or
look
her
knowledge
of
the
place
and
so
bring
an
amazed
question
to
lips
had
drawn
a
heavy
veil
over
her
face
betty
cheerily
interested
in
everything
she
saw
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
comment
and
so
this
is
dalton
what
a
funny
little
station
and
for
so
big
a
place
too
it
seemed
to
be
big
as
we
came
into
it
is
dalton
a
large
town
mother
why
rather
large
it
used
to
be
that
is
it
must
be
a
good
deal
over
fifteen
thousand
now
i
suppose
murmured
the
mother
speaking
very
unconcernedly
then
you
been
here
before
helen
realizing
that
already
she
had
made
one
mistake
suddenly
became
convinced
that
safety
and
certainly
tranquillity
of
mind
lay
in
telling
the
truth
to
a
certain
extent
oh
yes
i
was
here
years
ago
but
the
place
is
much
changed
i
fancy
she
answered
lightly
come
dear
we
take
a
taxi
but
first
i
want
a
paper
i
want
to
look
at
the
advertisements
for
a
maid
and
she
had
almost
reached
the
newsstand
when
to
betty
surprise
she
turned
sharply
about
and
walked
the
other
way
why
mother
i
thought
you
said
you
wanted
a
paper
cried
betty
hurrying
after
her
and
plucking
at
her
arm
but
i
did
i
do
i
changed
my
mind
i
wo
get
it
after
all
just
now
i
rather
hurry
right
home
she
spoke
rapidly
almost
feverishly
and
betty
noticed
that
she
engaged
the
first
cabby
she
saw
and
seemed
impatiently
anxious
to
be
off
what
she
did
not
see
however
was
that
twice
her
mother
covertly
glanced
back
at
the
newsstand
and
that
her
face
behind
the
veil
was
and
terrified
and
what
betty
did
not
know
was
that
as
the
taxi
started
her
mother
whispered
frenziedly
to
herself
that
was
that
was
cobb
she
older
and
grayer
but
she
got
cobb
eyes
and
nose
and
the
wart
i
know
that
wart
anywhere
and
to
think
how
near
i
came
to
to
her
it
was
a
short
drive
and
helen
and
her
daughter
were
soon
in
the
apartment
the
doctor
had
found
for
them
to
helen
it
looked
like
a
haven
of
refuge
indeed
her
near
encounter
with
cobb
at
the
station
had
somewhat
unnerved
her
but
with
four
friendly
walls
to
protect
her
and
with
no
eyes
but
her
daughter
in
sight
helen
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
threw
off
her
veil
hat
and
coat
oh
is
this
dear
she
exclaimed
sinking
into
a
chair
and
looking
admiringly
about
the
pretty
rooms
and
just
think
this
is
home
our
home
oh
dearie
we
going
to
be
happy
here
i
sure
of
course
we
are
and
it
is
lovely
here
the
words
were
all
right
but
voice
and
eyes
showed
a
trace
of
uneasiness
why
dearie
you
like
it
asked
the
girl
mother
anxiously
yes
oh
yes
i
like
it
all
it
only
that
i
was
thinking
all
of
a
sudden
about
that
denby
i
was
wondering
if
i
should
like
it
there
with
him
i
think
you
will
dear
but
it
all
be
so
new
and
and
different
from
what
i
been
used
to
do
you
see
of
course
my
dear
but
that
the
way
we
grow
by
encountering
things
new
and
different
you
see
but
come
we
got
lots
of
things
new
and
different
right
here
that
we
have
even
seen
yet
i
going
hunting
for
a
wardrobe
finished
the
mother
lightly
springing
to
her
feet
and
picking
up
her
hat
and
coat
it
was
a
pretty
little
apartment
of
five
rooms
up
one
flight
convenient
and
tastefully
furnished
i
do
think
even
burke
could
find
fault
with
this
thought
helen
a
bit
wistfully
as
her
eyes
lingered
on
the
soft
colorings
and
harmonious
blendings
of
rugs
and
hangings
aloud
she
said
dear
me
i
feel
just
like
a
little
girl
with
a
new
you
yes
and
when
our
trunks
come
and
we
get
our
photographs
and
things
out
it
will
be
lovely
wo
it
helen
at
one
of
the
windows
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
why
betty
from
this
window
we
can
see
see
what
cried
betty
hurrying
to
the
window
as
her
mother
words
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
the
city
dear
so
much
of
it
and
and
all
those
beautiful
houses
over
there
stammered
helen
see
that
church
with
the
big
dome
and
the
tall
spire
next
it
and
all
those
trees
that
must
be
a
park
she
hurried
on
pointing
out
anything
and
everything
but
the
one
big
old
colonial
house
with
its
tall
pillars
that
stood
out
so
beautifully
fine
and
clear
against
the
green
of
a
wide
lawn
on
the
opposite
hill
what
a
lovely
view
exclaimed
betty
at
her
side
why
i
noticed
it
at
all
before
but
we
on
a
hill
ourselves
are
we
yes
dear
west
hill
that
what
i
think
they
used
to
call
it
helen
was
not
at
the
window
now
she
had
turned
back
into
the
room
with
almost
an
indifferent
air
but
afterwards
when
betty
was
busy
elsewhere
she
went
again
to
the
window
and
stood
for
long
minutes
motionless
her
eyes
on
the
big
old
house
on
the
opposite
hill
it
was
ablaze
now
for
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
had
set
every
window
gorgeously
aflame
and
not
until
it
stood
again
gray
and
cold
in
the
gathering
dusk
did
helen
turn
back
into
the
room
and
then
it
was
with
eyes
and
a
long
sigh
getting
settled
was
much
the
same
thing
that
getting
settled
is
always
apt
to
be
there
were
the
same
first
scrappy
unsatisfying
meals
the
same
order
from
seemingly
hopeless
confusion
the
same
shifting
of
one
belongings
from
shelf
to
drawer
and
back
again
in
this
case
however
there
were
only
the
trunks
and
their
contents
to
be
disposed
of
and
the
getting
settled
was
after
all
a
short
matter
much
to
betty
disapproval
her
mother
early
announced
her
intention
of
doing
without
a
maid
oh
but
mother
dear
you
should
besides
i
thought
you
said
you
were
going
to
have
one
i
thought
at
first
i
would
but
i
changed
my
mind
there
will
be
just
us
two
and
i
rather
have
a
stout
woman
come
twice
a
week
for
the
laundry
and
cleaning
with
you
gone
all
day
i
shall
need
something
to
take
up
my
mind
betty
said
more
much
more
but
to
no
purpose
her
mother
was
still
obdurate
it
was
then
that
into
betty
mind
came
a
shrewd
suspicion
but
she
did
not
give
it
voice
when
evening
came
however
she
did
ask
some
questions
it
was
the
night
before
she
was
to
go
for
the
first
time
to
take
up
her
work
mother
how
did
we
happen
to
come
up
here
to
dalton
happen
to
come
up
here
helen
was
taken
by
surprise
she
was
fencing
for
time
yes
what
made
us
come
here
why
i
i
wanted
to
be
near
to
make
a
home
for
you
of
course
while
you
were
at
work
but
why
am
i
going
to
work
helen
stirred
restlessly
why
my
dear
i
told
you
i
think
every
girl
should
have
something
whereby
she
could
earn
her
bread
if
it
were
necessary
and
when
this
chance
came
through
gleason
i
thought
it
was
just
the
thing
for
you
to
do
indifferently
betty
asked
two
or
three
other
questions
immaterial
irrelevant
questions
that
led
her
quite
away
from
the
matter
in
hand
then
as
if
still
casually
she
uttered
the
one
question
that
had
been
the
purpose
of
the
whole
talk
mother
have
we
very
much
money
why
no
dear
not
so
very
much
but
i
would
worry
about
the
money
the
answer
had
come
promptly
and
with
a
reassuring
smile
but
betty
tossed
both
the
promptness
and
the
reassuring
smile
into
the
limbo
of
disdain
betty
had
her
answer
she
was
convinced
now
her
mother
was
poor
very
poor
that
was
why
there
was
to
be
no
maid
that
was
why
she
herself
was
to
go
as
secretary
to
this
denby
the
next
day
mother
poor
dear
mother
was
poor
as
if
she
cared
whether
she
liked
the
place
or
not
as
if
she
would
not
be
glad
to
work
her
fingers
off
for
mother
chapter
xxi
the
play
begins
i
shall
take
you
over
myself
said
helen
to
her
daughter
as
they
rose
from
the
breakfast
table
that
first
day
of
october
and
i
shall
show
you
carefully
just
how
to
come
back
this
afternoon
but
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
let
you
come
back
alone
dear
in
the
first
place
i
should
know
when
you
were
ready
and
in
the
second
place
i
want
to
go
and
wait
for
you
of
course
not
cried
betty
as
if
i
let
you
and
you
do
even
have
to
go
with
me
i
can
find
out
by
asking
no
i
shall
go
with
you
betty
noticed
that
her
mother
cheeks
were
very
pink
and
her
eyes
very
bright
do
forget
the
doctor
letter
and
remember
dear
just
be
be
your
own
dear
sweet
self
why
mother
you
exclaimed
the
dismayed
betty
crying
not
a
bit
of
it
the
head
came
proudly
erect
but
does
it
mean
so
much
to
you
that
i
that
i
that
he
likes
me
asked
betty
softly
the
next
moment
alarmed
and
amazed
she
found
her
mother
convulsive
arms
about
her
her
mother
trembling
voice
in
her
ears
it
mean
all
the
world
to
me
betty
oh
betty
my
baby
why
mother
exclaimed
the
girl
aghast
and
shaken
but
already
her
mother
had
drawn
herself
up
and
was
laughing
through
her
tears
dear
dear
but
only
look
at
the
fuss
this
old
is
making
at
the
first
flight
of
her
young
one
she
chattered
gayly
come
no
more
of
this
we
be
late
we
get
ready
right
away
you
say
you
have
the
letter
from
the
doctor
do
forget
that
no
i
wo
i
have
it
all
safe
tossed
the
girl
over
her
shoulder
as
she
hurried
away
for
her
hat
and
coat
a
minute
later
she
came
back
to
find
her
mother
shrouding
herself
in
the
black
veil
oh
mother
dear
you
are
going
to
wear
that
horrid
veil
are
you
she
remonstrated
why
yes
dear
why
not
i
do
like
it
a
bit
and
it
so
thick
i
ca
see
a
bit
of
through
it
ca
you
good
vaguely
betty
wondered
at
the
almost
gleeful
tone
of
the
voice
then
nobody
can
see
my
eyes
and
know
that
i
been
crying
ho
they
would
anyway
frowned
betty
your
eyes
are
red
at
all
mother
but
the
mother
only
laughed
again
gleefully
and
fastened
the
veil
with
still
another
pin
a
minute
later
mother
and
daughter
left
the
house
together
it
was
not
a
long
ride
to
the
foot
of
the
street
that
led
up
the
hill
to
burke
denby
home
with
carefully
minute
directions
as
to
the
return
home
at
night
helen
left
her
daughter
halfway
up
the
hill
with
the
huge
gates
of
the
denby
driveway
just
before
her
and
now
remember
everything
dear
she
faltered
clinging
a
little
convulsively
to
her
daughter
arm
dear
dear
but
i
not
sure
i
ought
to
let
you
go
after
all
she
choked
nonsense
mumsey
of
course
you
ought
to
let
me
go
then
you
must
remember
to
tell
me
everything
when
you
come
home
i
shall
want
to
know
every
single
little
thing
that
happened
i
will
dear
i
will
and
do
worry
i
sure
i
going
to
do
all
right
comforted
the
girl
plainly
trying
to
quiet
the
anxious
fear
in
her
mother
voice
and
what
a
beautiful
old
place
it
is
she
went
on
her
admiring
eyes
sweeping
the
handsome
house
and
spacious
grounds
beyond
the
gates
i
shall
love
it
there
i
know
and
i
so
glad
the
doctor
got
it
for
me
now
do
worry
she
finished
with
a
gay
wave
of
her
hand
as
she
turned
and
sped
up
the
hill
the
mother
with
a
last
lingering
look
and
a
sob
fortunately
smothered
in
the
enshrouding
veil
turned
and
hurried
away
in
the
opposite
direction
many
times
before
betty
return
late
that
afternoon
helen
wondered
that
a
day
just
one
little
day
could
be
so
long
it
seemed
to
her
that
each
minute
was
an
hour
and
each
hour
a
day
so
slowly
did
the
clock
tick
the
time
away
she
tried
to
work
to
sew
to
read
but
there
seemed
really
nothing
that
she
wanted
to
do
except
to
stand
at
one
of
the
windows
her
eyes
on
the
massive
old
house
set
in
its
wide
sweep
of
green
on
the
opposite
hill
what
was
happening
over
there
was
there
a
possible
chance
that
burke
would
question
suspect
discover
anything
how
would
he
like
betty
how
would
betty
like
him
how
would
betty
do
anyway
in
such
a
position
it
was
betty
first
experience
in
in
working
for
any
one
and
betty
sweet
and
dear
and
loving
as
she
was
had
something
of
the
denby
will
and
temper
as
her
mother
had
long
since
discovered
betty
was
fearless
and
if
she
did
not
like
but
what
was
happening
over
there
and
what
would
the
outcome
be
after
all
perhaps
as
the
doctor
had
said
it
was
something
of
a
comic
opera
and
farce
all
in
one
this
thing
she
was
doing
very
likely
the
whole
thing
from
the
first
when
she
ran
away
years
ago
had
been
absurd
and
preposterous
just
as
the
doctor
had
said
and
very
likely
burke
himself
when
he
found
out
would
think
so
too
it
was
a
fearsome
thing
to
take
matters
in
her
own
hands
as
she
had
done
and
attempt
to
twist
the
thread
in
fate
hands
and
wrest
it
away
from
what
she
feared
was
destruction
as
if
her
own
puny
fingers
could
deal
with
destiny
and
might
it
not
be
after
all
that
she
had
been
chasing
a
of
fancied
culture
all
these
years
true
she
no
longer
said
swell
and
grand
and
she
knew
how
to
eat
her
soup
quietly
but
was
that
going
to
make
burke
love
her
she
realized
now
something
of
what
it
was
that
she
had
undertaken
when
she
fled
to
the
doctor
years
ago
she
realized
too
that
during
these
intervening
years
there
had
come
to
her
a
very
real
sense
of
what
love
marriage
and
a
happy
home
ought
to
mean
and
what
they
must
mean
if
she
were
ever
to
be
happy
with
burke
or
to
make
him
happy
but
what
was
taking
place
over
there
at
ten
minutes
before
five
betty
reached
home
her
mother
met
her
halfway
down
the
stairs
oh
betty
you
you
here
she
panted
now
tell
me
everything
every
single
thing
she
reiterated
almost
dragging
the
girl
into
the
apartment
in
her
haste
and
excitement
do
skip
anything
not
the
least
little
thing
for
a
little
thing
might
mean
so
much
to
me
why
mother
exclaimed
betty
her
laughing
eyes
growing
vaguely
troubled
do
you
really
so
much
with
a
sudden
tightening
of
the
throat
helen
pulled
herself
up
sharply
she
gave
a
light
laugh
care
of
course
i
care
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
know
what
my
baby
has
been
doing
all
the
long
day
away
from
me
now
tell
me
sit
right
down
and
tell
me
from
the
beginning
all
right
i
will
smiled
betty
to
herself
she
said
poor
mother
as
if
i
would
work
my
fingers
off
before
i
fail
her
when
she
cares
so
much
when
she
so
much
what
i
earn
then
aloud
cheerily
she
began
illustration
so
i
rang
the
bell
well
first
i
walked
up
that
long
long
walk
through
that
beautiful
lawn
to
the
house
but
for
a
minute
i
did
ring
the
bell
it
was
so
beautiful
the
view
from
that
veranda
with
the
sun
on
the
reds
and
browns
and
yellows
of
the
trees
everywhere
then
i
remembered
suddenly
that
i
had
come
to
make
a
call
and
admire
the
view
but
that
i
was
a
business
woman
now
so
i
rang
the
bell
there
was
a
lovely
old
brass
knocker
on
the
great
door
but
i
saw
a
very
conspicuous
and
i
concluded
that
was
for
real
use
yes
yes
and
were
you
frightened
dear
well
we
call
it
then
as
i
was
planning
just
what
to
say
the
door
opened
and
the
oldest
little
old
man
i
ever
saw
stood
before
me
yes
go
on
he
was
the
butler
i
found
out
afterwards
they
called
him
benton
he
seemed
surprised
somehow
to
see
me
or
frightened
or
something
anyway
he
started
queerly
as
his
eyes
met
mine
and
he
muttered
a
quick
something
under
his
breath
but
all
i
could
hear
was
the
last
no
it
could
be
yes
yes
breathed
helen
her
face
a
little
white
the
next
minute
he
became
so
stiff
and
straight
and
dignified
that
even
his
english
cousin
might
have
envied
him
i
told
him
i
was
miss
darling
and
that
i
had
a
note
to
denby
from
gleason
miss
the
master
is
expecting
you
he
said
to
show
you
right
in
this
way
please
he
said
then
pompously
and
then
i
saw
that
great
hall
oh
mother
if
you
could
see
it
it
wonderful
and
so
full
of
treasures
i
could
hardly
take
off
my
hat
and
coat
properly
for
devouring
a
superb
specimen
of
old
armor
right
in
front
of
me
then
benton
took
me
into
the
library
and
i
saw
something
even
more
wonderful
you
mean
your
er
mr
denby
the
mother
face
was
aglow
betty
gave
a
merry
laugh
indeed
i
do
oh
he
was
there
but
he
was
no
wonder
mother
dear
the
wonder
was
cabinet
after
cabinet
filled
with
jades
and
bronzes
and
carved
ivories
and
babylonian
tablets
and
but
i
could
begin
to
tell
you
i
could
even
begin
to
see
for
myself
for
of
course
i
had
to
say
something
to
mr
denby
of
course
and
tell
me
what
was
he
he
like
oh
he
was
just
a
man
tall
and
and
a
little
gray
old
you
know
he
is
young
at
all
spoken
with
all
the
serene
confidence
of
betty
eighteen
years
he
has
nice
eyes
and
i
imagine
be
nice
if
he
let
himself
be
but
he
wo
why
betty
what
what
do
you
mean
betty
laughed
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
mother
dear
you
have
to
see
him
really
to
know
it
just
that
that
he
so
used
to
having
his
own
way
that
he
takes
it
as
a
matter
of
course
as
his
right
oh
my
dear
but
he
does
it
shows
up
in
everything
that
everybody
in
that
house
does
i
could
see
that
even
in
this
one
day
i
was
there
benton
sarah
the
maid
gowing
the
old
cousin
housekeeper
even
the
dog
and
the
cat
show
that
they
stood
at
attention
for
master
burke
denby
all
their
lives
you
just
wait
till
i
get
chance
i
show
him
somebody
that
is
standing
at
salute
all
the
time
there
was
real
horror
in
the
woman
voice
this
time
again
betty
merry
laugh
rang
out
do
look
so
shocked
dearie
i
sha
do
anything
or
say
anything
to
imperil
my
my
job
betty
eyes
twinkled
even
more
merrily
over
the
last
word
it
just
that
i
do
think
any
living
man
has
a
right
to
make
everybody
so
afraid
of
him
as
denby
very
plainly
has
done
and
i
only
mean
that
if
the
occasion
ever
came
up
i
should
let
him
know
that
i
am
not
afraid
of
him
oh
betty
betty
be
careful
be
i
beg
of
you
be
careful
oh
i
will
do
worry
laughed
the
girl
but
listen
do
you
want
me
to
go
on
with
my
story
yes
oh
yes
well
where
was
i
oh
i
know
just
inside
the
library
door
very
good
then
ruthlessly
suppressing
my
almost
overwhelming
longing
to
pounce
on
one
of
those
alluring
cabinets
i
advanced
properly
and
held
out
my
note
to
denby
as
i
came
near
i
fancied
that
he
too
gave
a
slight
start
as
he
looked
sharply
into
my
face
and
i
thought
i
caught
a
real
gleam
of
life
in
his
eyes
the
next
instant
it
was
gone
however
if
indeed
it
had
ever
been
there
and
he
had
taken
my
note
and
waved
me
politely
to
a
chair
yes
go
on
go
on
yes
well
do
you
know
that
exactly
what
i
felt
like
saying
to
him
laughed
betty
softly
he
just
glanced
at
the
note
with
a
low
ejaculation
then
he
sat
there
staring
at
nothing
for
so
long
that
i
began
to
think
i
should
scream
from
sheer
nervousness
then
perhaps
i
stirred
a
little
at
all
events
he
turned
with
a
start
and
then
is
when
i
saw
for
just
a
minute
how
kind
his
eyes
could
be
there
my
child
i
beg
your
pardon
he
cried
quite
forgot
you
were
here
something
your
eyes
i
think
set
me
to
dreaming
now
to
business
perhaps
you
be
good
enough
to
take
some
letters
for
me
you
find
pencils
pen
and
paper
there
at
your
right
and
i
did
and
i
began
and
that
all
all
but
surely
there
was
more
not
much
i
took
dictation
in
long
hand
for
perhaps
a
dozen
letters
most
of
them
short
ones
he
said
he
was
behind
on
his
personal
correspondence
then
he
went
away
and
left
me
he
goes
down
to
his
office
at
the
denby
iron
works
every
forenoon
i
understand
anyway
there
i
was
left
in
that
fascinating
room
with
all
those
cabinets
full
of
treasures
that
i
so
longed
to
explore
but
tied
to
a
lot
of
scrawly
notes
and
a
typewriter
i
forgot
to
say
there
was
one
of
those
disappearing
typewriters
in
a
desk
over
by
the
window
it
was
quite
like
gladys
but
the
keyboard
was
and
i
very
soon
got
the
run
of
it
at
one
he
came
back
i
had
the
letters
all
done
and
they
looked
lovely
i
was
rather
proud
of
them
i
passed
them
over
for
him
to
sign
and
waited
expectantly
for
a
nice
little
word
of
commendation
which
i
did
get
oh
but
i
sure
he
did
did
realize
that
that
oh
no
he
did
realize
of
course
that
this
was
my
maiden
effort
at
private
secretarying
laughed
betty
a
little
ruefully
and
that
i
wanted
to
be
patted
on
the
head
with
a
done
little
girl
he
just
shoved
them
back
for
me
to
fold
and
put
in
the
envelopes
and
just
then
benton
came
to
announce
luncheon
but
tell
me
about
the
luncheon
there
is
much
to
tell
there
were
just
us
three
at
the
table
denby
gowing
and
myself
there
was
plenty
to
eat
and
it
was
very
nice
but
dear
dear
the
dreariness
of
it
with
the
soup
gowing
observed
that
it
was
a
nice
day
with
the
chicken
patties
she
asked
if
i
liked
dalton
and
with
the
salad
she
remarked
that
we
had
had
an
unusually
cold
summer
dessert
was
eaten
in
utter
silence
why
mother
i
should
die
if
i
had
to
spend
my
life
in
an
atmosphere
like
that
but
did
denby
say
anything
oh
yes
he
asked
me
for
the
salt
and
he
gave
an
order
to
benton
oh
he
such
fascinating
company
he
is
at
the
disturbed
expression
on
her
mother
face
betty
gave
a
playful
shrug
oh
i
know
he
my
respected
employer
and
all
that
she
laughed
and
i
shall
be
very
careful
to
do
his
bidding
never
fear
but
that
does
mean
that
i
got
to
love
him
helen
denby
flushed
a
painful
red
but
i
wanted
i
hoped
you
would
er
him
my
dear
she
faltered
maybe
i
shall
when
i
get
him
er
trained
retorted
betty
flashing
a
merry
glance
into
her
mother
dismayed
eyes
do
worry
dear
i
was
a
perfect
angel
to
him
truly
i
was
listen
after
luncheon
denby
brought
me
three
or
four
newspapers
which
he
had
marked
here
and
there
and
for
an
hour
then
i
read
to
him
and
what
do
you
think
when
i
had
finished
he
said
in
that
crisp
short
way
of
his
have
a
good
voice
miss
darling
i
hope
you
wo
mind
if
i
ask
you
to
read
to
me
often
and
of
course
i
smiled
and
said
no
indeed
i
should
be
glad
to
read
as
often
as
he
liked
of
course
beamed
the
mother
with
so
decided
an
emphasis
that
betty
exclaimed
warningly
tut
tut
now
do
go
to
tumbling
down
and
worshiping
him
like
all
the
rest
him
helen
denby
cheeks
were
scarlet
yes
nodded
betty
with
tranquil
superiority
it
is
good
for
him
i
tell
you
he
does
get
anything
but
worship
from
every
single
one
of
those
people
around
him
honestly
if
he
should
declare
that
the
earth
was
flat
i
think
that
ridiculous
old
butler
and
that
scared
cousin
housekeeper
would
bow
as
you
say
sir
just
as
you
say
humph
he
better
tell
the
world
is
flat
some
day
oh
betty
betty
implored
betty
mother
but
betty
only
went
on
with
a
merry
toss
of
her
head
well
after
the
reading
there
were
other
letters
then
some
work
on
a
record
of
his
correspondence
after
that
i
came
home
but
mother
oh
mother
only
think
what
it
be
when
we
begin
to
catalogue
all
those
treasures
in
his
cabinets
and
we
going
to
do
it
he
said
we
were
it
seems
as
if
i
just
could
wait
but
you
will
be
careful
what
you
say
to
him
dear
begged
the
mother
again
anxiously
he
would
understand
your
mischief
dear
and
i
i
sure
he
would
like
it
betty
stooped
to
give
a
playful
kiss
careful
why
mumsey
dear
when
we
get
at
those
cabinets
he
may
tell
me
a
dozen
times
the
earth
is
flat
if
he
wants
to
and
i
wo
so
much
as
blink
if
i
think
there
any
danger
of
my
getting
cheated
out
of
that
cataloguing
chapter
xxii
actor
and
audience
helen
did
not
go
with
her
daughter
to
denby
house
the
second
morning
betty
insisted
that
she
was
quite
capable
of
taking
the
short
trip
by
herself
and
helen
seemed
nothing
loath
to
remain
at
home
helen
never
seemed
indeed
loath
to
remain
at
home
these
days
especially
during
daylight
in
the
evening
frequently
she
went
out
for
a
little
walk
with
betty
then
was
when
she
did
her
simple
marketing
then
too
was
the
only
time
she
would
go
out
without
the
heavy
black
veil
betty
being
away
all
day
and
at
home
only
after
five
did
not
notice
all
these
points
at
first
as
time
passed
however
she
did
wonder
why
her
mother
never
would
go
out
on
sunday
still
betty
was
too
thoroughly
absorbed
in
her
own
new
experiences
to
pay
much
attention
to
anything
else
every
morning
at
nine
she
left
the
house
eager
for
the
day
work
and
every
afternoon
soon
after
five
she
was
back
in
the
tiny
home
answering
her
mother
hurried
questions
as
to
what
had
happened
through
the
day
and
you
so
lovely
and
interested
in
every
little
thing
she
exclaimed
to
her
mother
one
day
but
i
interested
my
dear
in
every
little
thing
came
the
quick
answer
and
betty
looking
at
her
mother
flushed
face
and
trembling
lips
felt
suddenly
again
the
tightening
at
her
throat
that
her
success
or
failure
should
mean
so
much
to
mother
dear
mother
who
was
trying
so
hard
not
to
show
how
poor
they
were
for
perhaps
a
week
betty
reported
little
change
in
the
daily
routine
of
her
work
she
wrote
letters
read
from
books
magazines
or
newspapers
worked
on
the
record
of
correspondence
and
sorted
papers
pamphlets
and
circulars
that
had
apparently
been
accumulating
for
weeks
but
i
getting
along
beautifully
she
declared
one
day
i
got
gowing
thawed
so
she
actually
says
as
many
as
three
sentences
to
a
course
now
and
you
should
see
the
beaming
smile
benton
gives
me
every
morning
and
mr
denby
questioned
her
mother
with
poorly
concealed
eagerness
betty
lifted
her
brows
and
tossed
her
young
head
well
he
improving
she
flashed
mischievously
he
asked
for
the
salt
the
pepper
yesterday
and
he
actually
observed
that
he
thought
it
looked
like
snow
at
the
table
i
mean
of
course
he
speaks
to
me
about
my
work
through
the
day
but
he
does
say
any
more
than
is
necessary
truly
mother
dear
i
never
leave
my
happy
home
for
oh
betty
how
can
you
say
such
dreadful
things
betty
laughed
again
mischievously
do
worry
mumsey
he
never
ask
me
to
do
it
but
honestly
mother
i
ca
see
any
use
in
a
man
being
so
stern
and
glum
all
the
time
does
he
really
act
so
unhappy
then
at
an
unmistakable
something
in
her
mother
voice
betty
looked
up
in
surprise
why
mother
that
sounded
exactly
as
if
you
were
he
was
unhappy
she
exclaimed
helen
secretly
dismayed
and
terrified
boldly
flaunted
the
flag
of
courage
did
i
oh
no
she
laughed
easily
still
i
not
so
sure
but
i
am
a
little
glad
if
he
unhappy
all
the
more
chance
for
you
to
make
yourself
indispensable
by
helping
him
and
making
him
happy
see
happy
scoffed
betty
with
superb
disdain
why
the
man
does
know
what
the
word
means
but
perhaps
he
has
seen
a
great
deal
of
trouble
dear
the
eyes
were
gravely
tender
perhaps
he
has
but
is
that
any
reason
for
inflicting
it
on
other
people
by
reflection
demanded
betty
with
all
of
youth
intolerance
for
age
and
its
incomprehensible
attitudes
does
it
do
any
possible
good
either
to
himself
or
to
anybody
else
to
retire
behind
a
frown
and
a
grunt
and
look
out
upon
all
those
beautiful
things
around
him
through
eyes
that
are
like
a
piece
of
cold
steel
of
course
it
does
oh
betty
how
can
you
protested
the
dismayed
mother
again
but
betty
with
a
laugh
and
a
spasmodic
hug
that
ended
in
a
playful
little
shake
retorted
with
all
her
old
gay
sauciness
do
you
worry
mumsey
i
a
perfect
angel
to
that
man
then
wickedly
she
added
as
she
whisked
off
you
see
i
have
yet
had
a
chance
to
poke
even
one
finger
inside
of
one
of
those
cabinets
it
was
three
days
later
that
betty
having
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
at
denby
house
had
occasion
to
go
back
into
the
library
to
speak
to
her
employer
denby
shall
i
she
began
then
fell
back
in
amazement
the
man
before
her
had
leaped
to
his
feet
and
started
toward
her
his
face
white
like
paper
good
god
he
exclaimed
the
next
instant
he
stopped
short
the
blood
rushing
back
to
his
face
oh
i
er
i
thought
for
a
moment
you
were
a
fool
with
the
last
low
muttered
words
he
turned
and
sat
down
heavily
betty
to
whom
the
whole
amazing
sentence
was
distinctly
audible
lifted
demure
eyes
to
his
face
i
beg
your
pardon
you
said
the
sentence
came
to
a
suggestive
pause
into
betty
demure
eyes
flashed
an
unmistakable
twinkle
the
man
stared
frowned
then
flushed
a
deeper
red
as
full
comprehension
came
he
gave
a
grim
laugh
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
darling
that
epithet
was
meant
for
me
not
you
he
hesitated
his
eyes
still
searching
her
face
strange
strange
he
muttered
then
but
i
wonder
what
made
you
suddenly
look
so
much
like
take
off
your
hat
please
he
directed
abruptly
there
he
exclaimed
triumphantly
as
betty
pulled
out
the
pins
and
lifted
the
hat
from
her
head
that
explains
it
your
hat
before
when
i
first
saw
you
your
eyes
reminded
me
of
of
some
one
and
with
your
hat
on
the
likeness
is
much
more
striking
for
a
moment
i
was
actually
fool
enough
to
think
and
i
forgot
she
must
be
twice
your
age
now
too
he
finished
under
his
breath
betty
waited
a
silent
minute
at
the
door
then
apparently
still
unnoticed
she
turned
and
left
the
room
pinning
her
hat
on
again
in
the
hall
to
her
mother
that
afternoon
she
carried
a
jubilant
countenance
well
mother
he
alive
i
found
out
that
much
she
announced
merrily
he
who
burke
denby
to
be
sure
alive
why
betty
what
do
you
mean
he
alive
like
folks
twinkled
betty
he
got
memory
a
heart
and
i
a
sense
of
humor
i
sure
he
did
laugh
a
little
over
calling
me
a
fool
a
fool
child
what
have
you
done
now
moaned
betty
mother
nothing
dear
nothing
but
put
on
my
hat
chuckled
betty
irrepressibly
listen
and
i
tell
you
and
she
drew
a
vivid
picture
of
the
scene
in
the
library
there
what
did
i
tell
you
she
demanded
in
conclusion
did
i
do
anything
but
put
on
my
hat
oh
but
betty
you
must
you
ca
that
is
you
must
i
mean
be
careful
on
helen
face
joy
and
terror
were
fighting
a
battle
royal
careful
of
course
i
careful
cried
betty
did
i
stand
as
still
as
a
mouse
while
he
was
sitting
there
with
his
beetling
brows
bent
in
solemn
thought
and
then
did
i
turn
without
a
word
and
out
of
the
room
when
i
saw
that
he
had
ceased
to
realize
that
there
was
such
a
being
in
the
world
as
little
i
indeed
i
did
and
not
till
i
got
out
of
doors
did
i
remember
that
i
had
gone
into
that
library
in
the
first
place
to
ask
a
question
but
i
did
go
back
the
question
would
keep
and
that
was
more
than
i
could
promise
of
his
temper
if
i
disturbed
him
then
so
i
came
home
but
i
just
ca
wait
now
to
get
back
only
think
how
much
more
interesting
things
are
going
to
be
now
why
i
suppose
so
breathed
helen
a
little
doubtfully
oh
yes
i
shall
be
watching
always
for
him
to
come
alive
again
besides
it
so
romantic
it
a
of
course
why
betty
what
an
idea
the
mother
face
flamed
instantly
scarlet
why
of
course
it
is
mother
if
you
could
have
seen
his
face
have
known
that
no
one
but
somebody
he
cared
very
much
for
could
have
brought
look
to
it
you
see
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
i
was
she
then
he
said
a
fool
and
sat
down
next
he
just
looked
at
me
and
mother
in
his
eyes
there
were
just
years
and
years
of
sorrow
all
rolled
into
that
one
minute
were
there
really
the
mother
face
was
turned
quite
away
now
yes
and
do
you
see
i
not
going
to
mind
now
ever
what
he
says
and
does
nor
how
glum
he
is
for
i
down
inside
he
got
a
heart
and
only
think
look
like
finished
betty
suddenly
springing
to
her
feet
and
whirling
about
in
ecstasy
oh
it
so
exciting
it
but
her
mother
did
not
answer
she
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
perhaps
because
her
back
was
turned
she
had
crossed
the
room
to
the
window
betty
following
her
put
a
loving
arm
about
her
shoulders
oh
and
mother
look
she
exclaimed
eagerly
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
discovered
it
last
sunday
you
can
see
the
denby
house
from
here
did
you
know
it
it
so
near
dark
now
it
is
very
clear
but
a
light
in
the
library
windows
and
others
upstairs
too
see
right
through
there
at
the
left
of
that
dark
clump
of
trees
set
in
the
middle
of
that
open
space
that
the
lawn
and
you
can
just
make
out
the
tall
white
pillars
of
the
veranda
see
oh
yes
i
see
yes
so
you
can
ca
you
helen
voice
was
light
and
cheery
and
carefully
impersonal
carrying
no
hint
of
her
inward
tumult
for
which
she
was
devoutly
thankful
in
spite
of
her
high
expectations
betty
came
from
denby
house
the
next
afternoon
with
pouting
lips
he
just
exactly
the
same
as
ever
only
more
so
if
anything
she
complained
to
her
mother
he
dictated
his
letters
then
for
an
hour
i
think
he
just
sat
at
his
desk
doing
nothing
with
his
hand
shielding
his
eyes
twice
though
i
caught
him
looking
at
me
but
his
eyes
were
kind
and
and
human
as
they
were
yesterday
they
were
their
usual
little
bits
of
cold
steel
he
went
off
then
to
his
office
at
the
works
he
said
he
was
going
there
and
he
never
came
home
even
to
luncheon
i
did
have
half
work
enough
to
do
and
and
the
cabinets
were
locked
i
tried
them
at
four
he
came
in
signed
the
letters
said
and
stalked
upstairs
and
that
the
last
i
saw
of
him
nightly
after
this
for
a
time
betty
gave
forth
what
she
called
the
latest
bulletin
concerning
the
patient
no
change
sat
up
and
took
notice
slight
rise
in
temper
dull
and
listless
such
were
her
reports
then
came
the
day
when
she
impressively
announced
that
the
patient
showed
really
marked
improvement
he
asked
her
to
pass
not
only
the
salt
and
the
pepper
but
the
olives
and
indeed
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
she
went
on
with
mock
gravity
there
mighty
little
else
he
can
ask
me
to
pass
in
the
way
of
making
voluntary
conversation
for
benton
and
sarah
do
everything
almost
except
lift
the
individual
mouthfuls
for
our
consumption
oh
betty
betty
protested
her
mother
yes
yes
i
know
that
was
dreadful
was
it
dearie
laughed
betty
contritely
but
you
see
i
have
to
be
so
still
and
proper
up
there
that
home
becomes
a
regular
and
you
know
are
necessary
absolutely
necessary
helen
gazing
with
fond
meditative
eyes
at
the
girl
bright
face
drew
a
tremulous
sigh
yes
i
know
dear
but
you
see
i
so
afraid
you
should
be
not
with
a
retorted
betty
but
really
she
added
turning
back
laughingly
there
is
one
funny
thing
he
never
stays
around
now
when
there
any
chance
of
his
seeing
me
with
my
hat
on
again
i
noticed
it
every
single
night
since
that
time
he
did
see
me
a
week
ago
he
bade
me
his
stiff
and
gone
upstairs
i
ready
to
leave
betty
really
cried
helen
so
eagerly
that
betty
wheeled
and
faced
her
with
a
mischievous
laugh
who
interested
in
burke
denby
she
challenged
but
her
mother
her
hands
to
her
ears
had
fled
it
was
the
very
next
afternoon
that
betty
came
home
so
wildly
excited
that
not
for
a
full
five
minutes
could
her
startled
mother
obtain
anything
like
a
lucid
story
of
the
day
then
it
came
yes
yes
i
know
dear
of
course
you
ca
make
anything
out
of
what
i
say
but
listen
i
begin
at
the
beginning
it
was
like
this
this
morning
he
had
only
a
few
letters
for
me
then
in
that
tired
voice
he
uses
most
of
the
time
he
said
think
perhaps
now
we
might
as
well
begin
on
the
cataloguing
everything
else
is
pretty
well
caught
up
i
jumped
up
and
down
and
clapped
my
hands
and
you
did
demanded
her
mother
aghast
betty
nose
wrinkled
in
a
saucy
little
grimace
oh
i
mean
of
i
just
said
sir
or
well
denby
or
something
prim
and
proper
like
that
well
then
he
showed
me
huge
drawers
full
of
notes
and
clippings
in
a
perfectly
hopeless
mass
of
confusion
and
he
unlocked
one
of
the
cabinets
and
took
out
the
dearest
little
squat
buddha
with
diamond
eyes
and
showed
me
a
number
on
the
base
miss
darling
he
began
again
in
that
tired
voice
of
his
of
these
notes
and
clippings
are
numbered
in
pencil
to
correspond
with
numbers
like
these
on
the
curios
but
many
of
them
are
not
numbered
at
all
unfortunately
many
of
the
curios
too
lack
numbers
all
you
can
do
of
course
is
to
sort
out
the
papers
by
number
separating
into
a
single
pile
all
those
that
bear
no
number
i
shall
have
to
help
you
about
those
you
wo
of
course
know
where
they
go
i
may
have
trouble
myself
to
identify
some
of
them
later
after
the
preliminary
work
is
done
each
object
will
be
entered
on
a
card
together
with
a
condensed
tabulation
of
when
and
where
i
obtained
it
its
age
history
anything
in
short
that
we
can
find
pertaining
to
it
the
thing
to
do
first
however
is
to
go
through
these
drawers
and
sort
out
their
contents
by
number
having
said
this
still
in
that
weary
voice
of
his
he
put
back
the
little
buddha
which
my
fingers
were
just
tingling
to
get
hold
of
waved
his
hand
toward
the
drawers
and
papers
and
marched
out
of
the
room
then
i
set
to
work
but
what
did
you
do
how
did
you
do
it
what
were
those
papers
they
were
everything
mumsey
clippings
from
magazines
and
papers
and
sales
catalogues
of
antiques
typewritten
notes
and
scrawls
in
long
hand
telling
when
and
where
and
how
burke
denby
or
his
father
had
found
this
or
that
thing
but
what
a
mess
they
were
in
and
such
a
lot
of
them
without
the
sign
of
a
number
first
of
course
i
took
a
drawer
and
sorted
the
numbers
into
little
piles
on
the
big
flat
library
table
some
of
them
had
ten
or
a
dozen
all
one
number
that
work
was
very
easy
only
i
did
so
want
to
read
every
last
one
of
those
notes
and
clippings
but
of
course
i
stop
for
that
then
but
i
did
read
some
of
the
unnumbered
ones
and
pretty
quick
i
found
one
that
i
just
knew
referred
to
the
little
buddha
denby
had
taken
out
of
the
cabinet
i
resist
then
i
just
had
to
go
and
get
it
and
find
out
and
i
did
and
it
was
so
i
put
them
together
on
the
library
table
then
i
noticed
in
the
same
cabinet
a
little
old
worn
toby
jug
a
shepherd
plaid
about
the
oldest
and
rarest
there
is
you
know
and
i
knew
i
had
three
or
four
unnumbered
notes
on
toby
jugs
and
sure
enough
three
of
them
fitted
this
toby
and
i
put
together
with
the
jug
on
top
on
the
library
table
of
course
i
was
wild
then
to
find
some
more
in
the
other
cabinets
that
were
unlocked
i
could
see
through
the
glass
doors
a
lot
more
things
and
some
of
them
i
was
sure
fitted
some
of
my
unnumbered
notes
but
of
course
they
did
do
me
any
good
as
i
could
get
at
them
one
perfectly
beautiful
oriental
lacquered
cabinet
with
doors
was
full
of
tablets
big
and
little
and
i
was
crazy
to
get
at
those
i
had
a
lot
of
notes
about
tablets
i
did
find
in
my
cabinet
though
a
little
package
of
chinese
and
i
was
sure
i
had
something
on
those
and
i
had
i
knew
about
them
anyway
i
had
seen
some
in
london
these
dated
back
to
the
tang
dynasty
sixth
century
you
know
and
were
just
as
smooth
they
made
of
a
kind
of
paper
that
crumples
up
like
silk
but
show
creases
they
had
little
rings
printed
on
them
of
different
sizes
for
different
values
so
that
even
the
ignorant
people
could
be
deceived
and
yes
yes
dear
but
go
on
go
on
interrupted
the
mother
with
a
smile
i
want
to
know
what
happened
not
back
in
the
sixth
century
yes
yes
i
know
breathed
betty
but
they
were
interesting
those
things
were
well
of
course
i
put
the
with
their
clippings
on
the
table
then
i
began
on
another
drawer
it
got
to
be
one
very
soon
and
denby
came
home
to
luncheon
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
his
face
when
he
entered
the
library
and
saw
what
i
had
done
his
whole
countenance
lighted
up
why
he
looked
actually
handsome
and
he
forty
if
he
a
day
and
there
was
a
shred
of
tiredness
in
his
voice
then
when
he
found
the
and
the
buddha
and
the
toby
jug
with
the
unnumbered
clippings
belonging
to
them
he
got
almost
as
excited
as
i
was
and
when
he
saw
how
interested
i
was
he
unlocked
the
other
cabinets
and
how
we
did
talk
both
at
once
anyhow
whenever
i
stopped
to
get
my
breath
he
was
always
talking
and
i
never
could
wait
for
him
to
finish
there
was
so
much
i
wanted
to
ask
poor
old
benton
i
do
know
how
many
times
he
announced
luncheon
before
it
dawned
over
us
that
he
was
there
at
all
and
he
looked
positively
apoplectic
when
we
did
turn
and
see
him
i
do
dare
to
think
how
long
we
kept
luncheon
waiting
but
everything
had
that
flat
taste
and
benton
and
sarah
served
it
with
the
air
of
injured
saints
gowing
showed
meek
disapproval
and
did
make
even
one
remark
to
a
course
but
perhaps
after
all
that
was
because
she
did
have
a
chance
you
see
denby
and
i
talked
all
the
time
ourselves
but
i
thought
he
he
never
talked
he
has
before
but
you
see
he
had
such
a
lot
to
tell
me
about
the
things
how
he
came
by
them
and
all
that
and
every
single
one
of
them
has
got
a
story
and
he
has
such
wonderful
things
after
luncheon
he
showed
them
to
me
some
of
them
such
marvelous
bronzes
and
carved
ivories
and
babylonian
tablets
he
got
one
with
a
real
on
it
think
of
it
a
five
thousand
years
old
and
he
got
a
wonderful
buddha
two
thousand
years
old
from
a
chinese
temple
and
he
knows
the
officer
who
got
it
during
the
boxer
rebellion
you
know
and
he
got
another
not
so
old
of
himalayan
indian
wood
exquisitely
carved
and
half
covered
with
jewels
why
mother
he
traveled
all
over
the
world
and
everywhere
found
something
wonderful
or
beautiful
to
bring
home
i
could
begin
to
tell
you
if
i
talked
all
night
and
he
seemed
so
pleased
because
i
was
interested
and
because
i
could
appreciate
to
some
extent
their
value
i
can
imagine
it
there
was
a
little
catch
in
helen
denby
voice
but
betty
did
not
notice
it
yes
and
that
makes
me
think
she
went
on
blithely
he
said
such
a
funny
thing
once
it
was
when
i
held
in
my
hand
the
babylonian
tablet
with
the
i
had
just
been
saying
how
i
wished
the
little
tablet
had
the
power
to
transport
the
holder
of
it
back
to
a
vision
of
the
man
who
had
made
that
when
he
looked
at
me
so
queerly
and
muttered
they
more
than
potatoes
to
you
they
potatoes
indeed
what
do
you
suppose
made
him
say
that
oh
and
that
is
when
he
asked
me
too
how
i
came
to
know
so
much
about
jades
and
ivories
and
egyptian
antiques
what
did
you
tell
him
at
the
startled
half
terror
in
her
mother
voice
betty
eyes
widened
why
that
i
learned
in
london
of
course
with
you
and
gladys
and
miss
hughes
poking
around
old
shops
there
and
everywhere
else
that
we
could
find
them
wherever
we
were
know
how
we
used
to
go
as
gladys
called
it
yes
i
know
subsided
the
mother
a
little
faintly
well
we
worked
all
the
afternoon
denby
and
i
did
what
do
you
think
of
that
resumed
betty
after
a
moment
pause
and
not
once
since
this
morning
have
i
heard
any
tiredness
in
burke
denby
voice
if
you
please
but
how
how
long
is
this
going
to
take
you
oh
ages
and
ages
it
ca
help
it
why
mother
there
are
such
a
lot
of
them
and
such
a
whole
lot
about
some
of
them
others
that
he
does
know
so
much
about
we
going
to
look
up
he
has
lots
of
books
on
such
things
and
he
buying
more
all
the
time
then
all
this
stuff
has
got
to
be
condensed
and
tabulated
and
put
on
cards
and
filed
away
but
i
love
it
every
bit
of
it
and
i
so
excited
to
think
i
really
begun
it
and
he
every
whit
as
excited
as
i
am
mother
listen
he
actually
forgot
all
about
running
away
before
i
put
on
my
hat
and
i
never
thought
of
it
till
just
as
i
was
pinning
it
on
he
had
followed
me
out
into
the
hall
to
tell
me
something
about
the
old
armor
in
the
corner
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
stopped
just
like
that
and
said
miss
darling
in
his
old
stiff
way
as
he
turned
and
went
upstairs
i
caught
sight
of
his
face
i
knew
then
it
was
the
hat
i
had
reminded
him
again
of
but
i
sha
mind
now
if
he
is
stern
and
glum
sometimes
not
with
a
babylonian
tablet
or
a
chinese
buddha
for
company
oh
mother
if
you
could
see
those
wonderful
things
but
maybe
sometime
you
will
i
should
wonder
maybe
sometime
i
will
faltered
the
mother
growing
a
little
white
why
betty
what
do
you
mean
why
i
mean
maybe
i
can
take
you
sometime
i
ask
denby
by
and
by
after
we
get
things
straightened
out
if
he
wo
let
me
bring
you
some
day
to
see
them
oh
no
no
betty
do
do
i
i
could
think
of
such
a
thing
betty
laughed
merrily
why
mumsey
you
need
look
so
frightened
they
wo
bite
you
there
are
any
of
those
things
dear
no
of
course
not
but
i
i
sure
i
i
would
be
able
to
appreciate
them
at
all
but
in
london
you
were
to
learn
to
be
interested
in
such
things
persisted
betty
still
earnestly
do
you
know
you
said
you
to
learn
to
like
them
and
to
appreciate
them
yes
i
know
but
i
sure
i
would
like
to
to
trouble
denby
here
stammered
the
mother
her
face
still
very
white
chapter
xxiii
the
plot
thickens
it
was
shortly
before
christmas
that
frank
gleason
ran
up
to
dalton
he
went
first
to
see
burke
denby
burke
greeted
him
with
hearty
cordiality
hullo
gleason
good
you
just
in
time
for
dinner
but
where
your
bag
you
are
going
back
no
but
i
am
morning
very
early
so
i
left
my
grip
at
the
hotel
yes
yes
i
know
you
have
had
me
here
and
routed
the
whole
house
up
at
midnight
he
went
on
laughingly
shaking
his
head
at
burke
prompt
remonstrations
if
i
but
said
the
word
but
i
not
going
to
trouble
you
this
time
i
be
delighted
to
stay
to
dinner
however
if
i
get
an
invitation
he
smiled
an
invitation
as
if
you
needed
an
invitation
for
anything
in
this
house
scoffed
denby
all
mine
is
thine
as
you
know
very
well
thanks
i
half
a
mind
to
put
you
to
the
test
say
with
that
pet
tablet
of
yours
retorted
the
doctor
with
a
lift
of
his
eyebrows
however
we
let
it
go
at
a
dinner
this
looking
better
old
man
he
said
some
time
later
as
they
sat
at
the
table
his
eyes
critically
bent
on
the
other
face
i
am
better
glad
to
hear
it
how
business
very
good
that
is
it
good
i
have
been
near
the
works
for
a
week
so
not
sick
oh
no
busy
there
was
the
briefest
of
pauses
then
with
disconcerting
abruptness
came
the
question
where
you
get
that
girl
gleason
the
doctor
wanted
a
minute
to
think
incidentally
he
was
trying
to
swallow
his
heart
he
thought
it
must
be
his
heart
that
big
lump
in
his
throat
miss
darling
miss
darling
oh
the
doctor
waved
his
hand
inconsequently
he
still
wanted
time
he
was
still
swallowing
at
that
lump
why
she
she
i
told
you
she
the
daughter
of
an
old
friend
why
is
she
all
right
he
feigned
the
deepest
concern
right
voice
and
manner
carried
a
message
of
satisfaction
that
was
unmistakable
but
the
doctor
chose
to
ignore
it
the
doctor
felt
himself
now
on
sure
ground
he
summoned
a
still
deeper
concern
to
his
countenance
why
denby
you
do
mean
she
all
right
what
the
trouble
is
she
capable
or
do
you
like
her
ways
but
i
mean
she
all
right
man
retorted
the
other
impatiently
why
gleason
she
a
wonder
gleason
within
whom
the
hallelujah
chorus
had
become
such
a
shout
of
triumph
that
he
half
expected
to
see
burke
denby
cover
his
ears
managed
to
utter
a
cool
really
well
i
glad
i
sure
well
she
is
she
no
ordinary
girl
if
helen
could
but
hear
that
exulted
the
doctor
to
himself
why
what
do
you
think
she
can
actually
tell
some
things
about
my
own
curios
then
they
are
more
than
er
potatoes
to
her
you
know
you
said
yes
i
know
i
did
but
just
hear
this
in
spite
of
her
seeming
intelligence
and
capability
i
been
dreading
to
open
those
cabinets
and
let
her
touch
those
things
dad
and
i
had
spent
so
many
dear
years
together
gathering
but
of
course
i
knew
that
that
was
silly
one
of
my
chief
reasons
for
getting
her
was
the
cataloguing
and
it
was
absurd
not
to
set
her
at
it
so
one
day
after
everything
else
was
done
i
explained
what
i
wanted
and
told
her
to
go
ahead
well
and
did
she
prompted
the
doctor
as
the
other
paused
she
did
that
she
went
ahead
ahead
of
what
i
told
her
to
do
why
when
i
got
home
i
was
amazed
to
see
what
she
done
but
best
of
all
was
her
interest
and
her
enthusiasm
and
the
fact
that
she
knew
and
appreciated
what
they
were
you
see
that
one
of
the
things
i
been
dreading
her
ignorance
her
indifference
but
i
dreaded
more
that
she
might
gush
and
say
how
pretty
and
i
knew
if
she
did
i
i
want
to
knock
her
down
so
glad
she
did
murmured
the
doctor
his
host
laughed
shamefacedly
oh
yes
i
know
that
was
rather
a
strong
statement
but
you
see
i
felt
strongly
and
then
to
find
but
gleason
she
really
is
a
wonder
working
together
now
working
as
i
said
i
have
been
to
the
office
for
a
week
is
she
agreeable
personally
yes
very
she
pleasant
and
cheerful
bright
and
very
much
of
a
lady
she
capable
and
has
uncommon
good
sense
her
voice
too
is
excellent
for
reading
in
short
she
is
as
i
told
you
a
wonder
and
i
more
than
indebted
to
you
for
finding
her
let
see
you
say
you
do
know
her
family
gleason
got
suddenly
to
his
feet
yes
oh
yes
good
family
too
now
i
sorry
to
eat
and
run
as
the
children
say
but
i
have
to
burke
one
or
two
other
little
matters
i
have
to
attend
to
before
i
sleep
but
as
i
said
a
few
minutes
ago
i
glad
to
see
you
in
better
spirits
keep
on
with
the
good
work
the
doctor
seemed
nervous
and
anxious
to
get
away
and
in
another
minute
the
great
outer
door
had
closed
behind
him
wonder
what
his
rush
puzzled
burke
denby
left
standing
in
the
hall
there
was
a
slight
frown
on
his
face
but
in
another
minute
it
was
gone
he
had
remembered
suddenly
that
he
had
promised
miss
darling
that
he
would
try
to
find
certain
obscure
data
regarding
the
tablet
they
had
been
at
work
upon
that
afternoon
it
was
just
as
well
perhaps
after
all
that
the
doctor
had
had
to
leave
early
it
would
give
more
time
for
work
with
an
eager
lifting
of
his
head
burke
denby
turned
and
strode
into
the
library
meanwhile
hurrying
away
from
denby
house
was
the
doctor
his
whole
self
a
hallelujah
chorus
of
rejoicing
his
countenance
was
still
aglow
with
joy
when
a
little
later
he
rang
the
bell
of
a
west
hill
suite
bearing
the
name
helen
darling
to
his
joy
he
found
helen
alone
but
hardly
had
he
given
her
a
hasty
account
of
his
visit
to
burke
denby
and
assured
her
that
he
was
positive
everything
was
working
out
finely
when
betty
came
in
from
the
corner
grocery
store
breezy
and
smiling
oh
it
dr
gleason
she
welcomed
him
now
i
glad
mother
go
with
me
after
all
for
we
both
been
out
then
and
we
should
have
seen
you
which
would
have
been
my
great
loss
bowed
the
man
gallantly
his
approving
eyes
on
betty
glowing
face
oh
but
ours
too
especially
mine
she
declared
you
see
i
been
wishing
you
come
i
wanted
to
thank
you
to
thank
me
yes
for
finding
this
lovely
place
for
me
you
like
it
then
i
love
it
why
gleason
you
have
no
idea
of
the
wonderful
things
that
man
but
you
said
you
knew
him
she
broke
off
suddenly
you
know
him
oh
yes
very
well
then
you
been
there
of
course
many
times
oh
how
silly
of
me
she
laughed
as
if
i
could
tell
anything
about
antiques
and
curios
but
has
he
some
beautiful
things
he
has
indeed
but
how
about
the
man
you
have
told
me
at
all
how
you
like
denby
himself
betty
glanced
at
her
mother
with
a
roguish
shrug
well
as
i
tell
mother
now
that
i
got
him
trained
he
does
very
well
my
murmured
her
mother
trained
the
question
was
the
doctor
yes
you
see
at
first
he
was
such
a
bear
oh
betty
exclaimed
her
mother
in
very
genuine
distress
but
betty
plainly
was
in
one
of
her
most
mischievous
moods
with
another
merry
glance
at
her
mother
she
turned
to
the
doctor
it
only
this
doctor
you
see
at
first
he
was
so
silent
and
solemn
and
benton
and
sarah
and
gowing
were
so
scared
and
the
whole
house
was
so
scared
and
silent
and
solemn
that
it
seemed
some
days
as
if
i
should
scream
just
to
make
a
little
excitement
but
it
all
very
different
now
benton
and
sarah
are
all
smiles
gowing
actually
laughs
sometimes
and
the
only
trouble
is
there
is
time
enough
for
denby
to
get
in
all
the
talking
he
wants
to
then
denby
seems
happier
oh
very
much
of
course
at
first
it
was
just
about
the
work
cataloguing
the
curios
but
lately
it
been
in
other
ways
why
the
other
day
he
found
i
could
play
and
sing
a
little
and
he
asked
me
to
sing
for
him
and
i
did
helen
sat
suddenly
erect
in
her
chair
sing
you
sang
for
mr
denby
she
cried
plainly
very
much
agitated
but
you
had
told
me
that
i
had
done
it
till
this
afternoon
just
before
i
came
home
laughed
betty
but
what
did
you
sing
oh
you
you
did
sing
any
of
those
foolish
nonsensical
songs
did
you
implored
helen
half
rising
from
her
chair
but
i
did
bridled
betty
then
as
her
mother
fell
back
dismayed
she
cried
did
you
suppose
i
risk
singing
solemn
things
to
a
man
who
had
just
learned
to
laugh
but
moaned
helen
when
he
always
hated
it
so
hated
it
so
echoed
betty
with
puzzled
eyes
why
i
played
it
before
dearie
i
had
played
anything
no
no
i
i
mean
always
hated
everything
gay
and
lively
ragtime
corrected
helen
her
cheeks
abnormally
pink
as
she
carefully
avoided
the
doctor
eyes
why
did
you
play
some
of
your
good
music
dear
oh
i
did
afterwards
of
course
macdowell
and
schubert
and
that
lullaby
we
love
but
he
liked
the
ragtime
too
all
right
i
know
he
did
besides
it
just
did
me
good
to
liven
up
the
old
house
a
bit
i
know
benton
was
listening
in
the
hall
and
i
positive
sarah
and
the
cook
had
the
door
open
as
for
gowing
she
dear
old
soul
just
sat
and
frankly
cried
and
the
merrier
i
sang
the
faster
the
tears
rolled
down
her
face
but
it
was
for
joy
i
could
see
that
and
once
i
heard
her
mutter
think
that
ever
again
i
should
hear
music
and
laughter
gleason
did
denby
ever
love
somebody
once
and
do
i
look
like
her
taken
utterly
by
surprise
the
doctor
for
one
awful
minute
floundered
in
appalled
confusion
it
was
helen
this
time
who
came
to
the
rescue
i
shall
tell
the
doctor
he
need
answer
that
question
betty
she
said
with
just
a
shade
of
reproval
in
her
voice
if
he
did
know
of
such
a
thing
do
you
think
he
ought
to
tell
you
or
anybody
else
betty
laughed
and
colored
a
little
no
dear
of
course
not
and
i
should
have
asked
it
should
i
but
what
makes
you
think
he
has
queried
the
doctor
with
very
much
the
air
of
a
small
boy
who
is
longing
yet
fearing
to
investigate
the
reason
for
the
of
a
firecracker
because
he
said
twice
that
i
reminded
him
of
some
one
particularly
with
my
hat
on
and
both
times
afterward
he
looked
so
romantic
and
solemn
betty
eyes
began
to
twinkle
that
i
thought
maybe
i
was
on
the
track
of
a
real
live
you
see
but
he
has
said
anything
about
it
lately
so
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
after
all
you
see
really
he
quite
like
folks
now
since
we
been
working
on
the
curios
and
how
are
you
getting
along
with
those
very
well
only
it
slow
of
course
there
is
such
a
mass
of
material
and
so
much
to
look
up
and
study
up
besides
we
just
getting
it
together
and
tabulating
it
now
on
temporary
sheets
we
sha
begin
the
real
cataloguing
on
the
final
cards
until
we
have
all
our
material
in
hand
denby
says
but
you
are
getting
tired
of
it
not
a
bit
i
love
it
even
the
digging
after
dates
i
sure
can
understand
that
she
smiled
yes
i
can
understand
that
he
smiled
back
at
her
and
now
for
the
first
time
for
long
minutes
he
dared
to
look
across
the
room
into
helen
denby
eyes
chapter
xxiv
in
thinking
it
over
afterwards
burke
denby
tried
to
place
the
specific
thing
that
put
into
his
mind
that
most
astounding
suggestion
he
knew
very
well
the
precise
moment
of
the
inception
of
the
idea
it
had
been
on
christmas
night
as
he
sat
before
the
fire
in
his
gloomy
library
but
what
had
led
to
it
of
just
what
particular
episode
concerning
his
acquaintance
with
this
girl
had
he
been
thinking
when
like
a
blinding
flash
out
of
the
dark
had
leaped
forth
those
startling
words
he
had
been
particularly
lonely
that
evening
perhaps
because
it
was
christmas
and
he
could
not
help
comparing
his
own
silent
fireside
with
the
gay
homes
all
about
him
being
christmas
he
had
not
had
even
the
divertisement
of
his
presence
companionship
yes
it
was
companionship
he
decided
it
could
not
but
be
that
when
she
brought
so
much
love
and
enthusiasm
to
the
work
as
well
as
the
truly
remarkable
skill
and
knowledge
she
displayed
and
she
was
too
such
a
charming
girl
so
bright
and
lovable
the
house
had
not
been
the
same
since
she
came
into
it
he
hoped
he
might
keep
her
he
should
not
like
to
let
her
go
now
but
if
only
she
could
be
there
all
the
time
it
would
be
much
easier
for
winter
storms
were
coming
on
now
and
as
for
him
he
should
like
it
very
much
the
evenings
were
interminably
long
sometimes
he
wondered
if
after
all
it
might
not
be
arranged
there
was
a
mother
he
believed
they
lived
in
an
apartment
on
west
hill
but
she
could
doubtless
be
left
all
right
or
she
might
even
come
too
if
it
were
necessary
surely
the
house
was
large
enough
and
she
might
be
good
company
for
his
cousin
and
it
would
be
nice
for
the
daughter
it
might
indeed
be
a
very
suitable
arrangement
all
around
of
course
if
he
had
a
wife
and
daughter
of
his
own
he
would
not
have
to
be
filling
his
house
with
strangers
like
this
if
helen
had
not
curious
too
how
the
girl
was
always
making
him
think
of
helen
her
eyes
especially
when
she
had
on
her
hat
and
little
ways
she
had
it
came
then
with
an
electric
force
that
brought
him
to
his
feet
with
almost
a
cry
what
if
she
were
maybe
she
your
daughter
as
he
paced
the
room
feverishly
burke
denby
tried
to
bring
the
chaos
of
thoughts
into
something
like
order
it
was
absurd
of
course
it
could
not
be
and
yet
there
were
her
eyes
so
like
helen
and
the
way
she
had
of
pushing
back
her
hair
and
of
lifting
her
chin
when
she
was
determined
about
something
there
were
too
actually
some
little
things
in
her
that
reminded
him
of
himself
and
surely
her
remarkable
love
and
aptitude
for
the
work
she
was
doing
for
him
now
ought
to
mean
something
but
could
it
be
was
it
would
helen
do
such
a
fantastic
thing
send
him
his
own
daughter
like
this
and
the
doctor
this
girl
had
been
introduced
by
him
then
he
too
must
be
in
the
plot
a
daughter
of
an
old
friend
yes
that
might
be
but
would
gleason
lend
himself
to
such
a
wild
scheme
it
seemed
too
absurd
to
be
possible
and
yet
his
mind
still
played
with
the
idea
just
what
did
he
know
about
this
young
woman
very
little
what
if
after
all
it
were
dorothy
elizabeth
and
it
might
be
for
all
he
to
the
she
was
about
the
right
age
he
should
judge
his
little
girl
would
be
eighteen
by
now
her
name
was
elizabeth
she
had
told
him
that
at
the
same
time
saying
that
she
was
always
called
betty
there
was
a
mother
but
he
had
never
heard
the
girl
mention
her
father
and
they
had
dropped
as
it
were
right
out
of
a
clear
sky
into
dalton
and
into
his
life
could
it
be
of
course
it
really
was
too
absurd
but
yet
with
a
sudden
setting
of
his
jaws
the
man
determined
to
put
his
secretary
through
a
course
of
questions
the
answers
to
which
would
forever
remove
all
doubt
one
way
or
another
if
at
the
onset
of
the
questioning
she
grew
suddenly
evasive
and
confused
he
would
have
his
answer
at
once
she
was
his
daughter
and
was
attempting
to
keep
the
knowledge
from
him
until
such
time
as
her
mother
should
wish
to
let
the
secret
out
on
the
other
hand
even
if
she
were
not
confused
or
evasive
as
to
her
answers
she
still
might
be
his
daughter
and
not
know
of
the
relationship
in
which
case
his
questions
of
course
must
be
carried
to
the
point
where
he
himself
would
be
satisfied
meanwhile
he
would
think
no
more
about
it
and
above
all
he
would
keep
his
thoughts
from
dwelling
on
what
it
would
be
if
she
were
having
reached
this
wise
decision
burke
denby
tossed
his
cigar
into
the
fire
and
attempted
to
toss
as
lightly
the
whole
subject
from
his
mind
an
attempt
which
met
with
sorry
success
burke
denby
plumed
himself
that
he
was
doing
his
questioning
most
diplomatically
when
the
next
morning
he
began
to
carry
out
his
plans
with
almost
superhuman
patience
he
had
waited
until
the
morning
letters
were
out
of
the
way
and
until
he
and
his
secretary
were
working
together
over
sorting
the
papers
in
a
hitherto
unopened
drawer
did
you
have
a
pleasant
christmas
miss
darling
careless
as
was
his
apparent
aim
it
was
the
first
gun
of
his
campaign
yes
thank
you
very
pleasant
i
did
too
quiet
a
house
needs
young
people
at
christmas
if
only
i
had
a
daughter
now
he
watched
her
face
closely
but
he
could
detect
no
change
of
color
there
was
only
polite
sympathetic
interest
let
me
see
you
live
with
your
mother
i
believe
he
finished
somewhat
abruptly
yes
have
you
lived
in
dalton
long
only
since
october
when
i
came
to
you
do
you
like
it
here
oh
yes
very
well
still
not
so
well
as
where
you
came
from
perhaps
he
smiled
pleasantly
betty
laughed
but
i
came
from
so
many
places
that
so
paris
berlin
london
genoa
mostly
london
of
late
but
you
are
american
born
oh
yes
i
thought
so
still
it
is
a
little
singular
having
been
gone
so
long
that
you
are
so
american
in
your
speech
and
manner
you
are
a
bit
english
miss
darling
betty
laughed
again
merrily
how
mother
would
love
to
hear
you
say
that
she
cried
you
see
mother
was
so
afraid
i
would
be
english
or
something
foreign
educated
as
i
was
almost
entirely
across
the
water
but
we
were
with
americans
all
the
time
and
our
teachers
except
for
languages
were
americans
whenever
possible
i
see
and
now
you
are
here
in
america
again
and
does
your
mother
like
it
here
why
i
think
so
and
does
she
like
dalton
too
perhaps
she
has
been
here
before
though
the
casual
way
in
which
the
question
was
put
gave
no
indication
of
the
way
the
questioner
was
holding
his
breath
for
the
answer
oh
yes
she
was
here
several
years
ago
she
says
indeed
to
burke
denby
it
was
as
if
something
within
him
had
suddenly
snapped
he
relaxed
in
his
chair
his
eyes
were
still
covertly
searching
betty
serene
face
bent
over
her
work
within
himself
he
was
saying
well
does
know
whatever
it
is
aloud
he
resumed
and
were
you
too
ever
here
why
yes
but
i
do
remember
it
i
was
only
a
year
or
two
old
mother
said
the
man
almost
leaped
from
his
chair
then
sternly
he
forced
himself
to
work
one
full
minute
without
speaking
a
dozen
agitated
questions
were
clamoring
for
utterance
but
he
knew
better
than
to
give
them
voice
with
a
cheery
casualness
of
manner
that
made
him
inordinately
proud
of
himself
he
said
well
i
certainly
am
glad
you
came
now
i
sure
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
you
had
but
by
the
way
how
did
you
happen
to
come
to
me
again
he
held
his
breath
why
through
gleason
you
knew
that
yes
but
i
know
only
that
you
never
did
exactly
this
sort
of
work
before
did
you
no
oh
no
but
there
has
to
be
a
beginning
you
know
and
mother
says
she
thinks
every
girl
ought
to
know
how
to
do
something
so
that
she
can
support
herself
if
it
is
necessary
and
in
our
case
i
think
it
is
necessary
low
as
the
last
words
were
the
man
sensitively
alert
ear
caught
them
you
mean
i
mean
i
think
mother
is
is
poor
and
is
trying
to
keep
it
from
me
the
words
came
with
all
the
impetuosity
of
one
who
has
found
suddenly
a
sympathetic
ear
for
a
secret
i
can
see
it
in
so
many
ways
not
keeping
a
maid
and
being
so
so
anxious
that
i
shall
do
well
here
and
and
she
does
seem
natural
some
way
lately
unhappy
or
something
and
she
goes
out
so
little
almost
never
except
in
the
evening
she
does
care
to
to
see
people
perhaps
by
a
supreme
effort
burke
denby
hid
the
fever
of
excitement
and
rejoicing
within
him
and
toned
his
voice
to
just
the
right
shade
of
solicitous
interest
no
she
does
admitted
betty
with
a
long
sigh
then
impulsively
she
added
she
seems
so
very
afraid
of
meeting
people
that
wondered
sometimes
if
maybe
she
had
old
friends
here
and
and
want
to
meet
them
because
perhaps
her
circumstances
were
changed
now
that
is
like
mother
but
oh
i
should
say
all
this
to
you
denby
i
i
did
think
really
i
spoke
before
i
thought
you
seemed
so
interested
i
am
interested
my
dear
miss
darling
returned
the
man
not
quite
steadily
i
i
think
i
should
like
to
know
your
mother
she
lovely
are
you
like
her
he
had
contrived
to
throw
into
his
eyes
a
merry
challenge
against
her
taking
this
as
she
might
take
it
but
betty
was
too
absorbed
to
be
flippant
or
even
merrily
why
i
do
know
but
i
do
think
so
except
my
eyes
every
one
says
my
eyes
like
hers
burke
denby
got
suddenly
to
his
feet
and
walked
quite
across
the
room
apparently
he
was
examining
a
rare
old
venetian
glass
tear
vase
especially
prized
by
him
for
its
associations
in
reality
he
was
trying
to
master
the
tumult
within
him
he
had
now
not
one
remaining
doubt
this
stupendous
thing
was
really
so
she
was
his
elizabeth
his
betty
yet
there
remained
still
one
more
test
he
must
ask
about
her
father
and
for
this
he
must
especially
brace
himself
he
could
imagine
what
helen
must
have
taught
her
of
him
very
slowly
the
vase
still
unconsciously
clutched
in
his
hand
burke
denby
walked
back
to
the
table
and
sat
down
well
as
i
said
i
should
like
to
see
your
mother
he
smiled
i
feel
that
i
know
her
already
but
your
father
i
do
think
you
have
told
me
a
thing
about
your
father
yet
a
rapt
wistfulness
came
to
the
girl
face
father
oh
but
i
never
stop
talking
when
i
get
to
telling
of
him
you
see
i
never
knew
him
no
infinite
longing
and
tenderness
were
coming
into
the
man
eyes
but
i
know
him
mother
has
told
me
you
see
so
i
know
just
how
fine
and
noble
and
splendid
he
was
and
he
was
the
words
as
they
fell
from
burke
denby
dry
lips
were
barely
audible
oh
yes
you
see
all
the
way
ever
since
i
could
remember
daddy
has
been
held
up
to
me
as
so
fine
and
splendid
why
i
learned
to
hold
my
fork
and
my
temper
the
way
daddy
would
want
me
to
and
there
was
a
song
or
a
sunset
or
a
beautiful
picture
that
i
was
told
how
daddy
would
have
loved
it
mother
was
always
talking
of
him
and
telling
me
about
him
so
i
feel
that
i
know
him
just
as
if
he
were
alive
as
if
he
alive
burke
denby
half
started
from
his
chair
his
face
a
for
contending
emotions
yes
but
he
is
you
see
he
died
many
many
years
ago
there
was
the
sudden
tinkling
of
shattered
glass
on
a
polished
floor
oh
mr
denby
exclaimed
betty
in
consternation
your
beautiful
vase
the
man
however
did
not
even
glance
at
the
ruin
at
his
feet
still
he
must
have
realized
what
he
had
done
thought
betty
for
as
he
crossed
to
his
desk
and
sat
down
heavily
she
heard
him
mutter
to
think
i
have
been
such
a
fool
chapter
xxv
enigmas
not
until
burke
denby
became
convinced
that
miss
elizabeth
darling
was
not
his
daughter
did
he
realize
how
deeply
the
thought
that
she
might
be
had
taken
hold
of
his
very
life
how
closely
entwined
in
his
affections
she
had
become
from
the
first
minute
the
electrifying
idea
of
her
possible
relationship
had
come
to
him
he
had
in
spite
of
his
determination
to
the
contrary
reveled
in
pictures
of
what
his
home
would
be
with
a
daughter
like
that
to
love
and
to
love
him
helen
too
was
in
the
pictures
true
a
vague
shadowy
helen
yet
a
helen
idealized
and
glorified
by
the
remorseful
repentance
born
of
a
bunch
of
worn
little
diaries
then
to
have
the
beautiful
vision
shattered
by
one
word
from
the
girl
own
lips
and
just
when
he
had
attained
the
pinnacle
of
joyous
conviction
that
she
was
indeed
his
little
girl
of
the
long
ago
it
seemed
as
though
he
could
not
bear
it
and
most
anguishing
of
all
there
was
no
chance
that
there
was
a
mistake
even
if
the
incongruity
of
her
description
of
her
father
as
applied
to
himself
could
be
explained
away
there
was
yet
the
insurmountable
left
with
his
own
ears
he
had
heard
her
say
that
her
father
was
dead
had
been
dead
for
many
years
that
settled
it
of
course
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
death
after
the
first
stunning
force
of
the
disappointment
there
came
to
burke
denby
the
reaction
in
the
case
of
burke
denby
a
characteristic
reaction
it
became
evident
to
some
extent
the
very
next
day
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
he
did
not
work
with
his
secretary
over
the
cataloguing
at
all
during
the
day
he
dictated
his
letters
then
left
at
once
for
his
office
at
the
works
at
luncheon
he
relapsed
into
his
old
stern
silence
and
in
the
afternoon
beyond
giving
a
few
crisp
directions
he
showed
no
interest
in
betty
work
absenting
himself
most
of
the
time
from
the
room
yet
not
in
the
least
was
all
this
consciously
planned
on
his
part
he
felt
simply
an
aversion
to
being
with
this
girl
even
the
sight
of
her
bright
head
bent
over
her
work
gave
him
a
pang
the
sound
of
her
voice
brought
bitterness
above
all
he
dreaded
a
glance
from
her
eyes
helen
eyes
that
had
lured
him
for
a
brief
hours
into
a
fool
paradise
of
thinking
they
might
indeed
be
helen
eyes
burke
was
grievously
disappointed
ashamed
and
angry
and
being
accustomed
always
to
acting
exactly
as
he
felt
he
acted
now
as
he
felt
he
was
grievously
disappointed
that
his
brief
dream
of
a
daughter
in
his
home
should
have
come
to
naught
he
was
ashamed
that
he
should
have
allowed
himself
to
be
deluded
into
such
a
dream
and
angry
that
the
thing
had
so
stirred
him
that
he
could
be
so
stirred
by
the
failure
of
so
absurd
and
preposterous
a
supposition
to
materialize
into
fact
as
the
days
passed
matters
became
worse
rather
than
better
added
to
his
disappointment
and
chagrin
there
came
to
be
an
unreasoning
wrath
that
this
girl
was
not
his
daughter
together
with
a
rebellion
at
his
lonely
life
and
an
overmastering
that
he
should
be
so
abused
of
fate
it
was
then
that
he
began
systematically
to
avoid
so
far
as
was
possible
being
with
the
girl
at
all
save
for
the
necessary
dictation
and
instructions
this
was
the
more
easily
accomplished
as
the
cataloguing
now
had
almost
arrived
at
the
stage
where
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
copying
and
tabulating
the
mass
of
material
already
carefully
numbered
to
correspond
with
the
equally
carefully
numbered
curios
in
the
cabinets
in
spite
of
it
all
however
burke
denby
knew
in
his
heart
that
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
fond
of
this
young
girl
more
and
more
interested
in
her
welfare
more
and
more
restless
and
dissatisfied
when
not
in
her
presence
more
and
more
poignantly
longing
to
make
her
his
daughter
by
adoption
now
that
it
was
settled
beyond
question
that
she
was
not
his
by
the
ties
of
flesh
and
blood
outwardly
however
he
remained
the
stern
unsmiling
man
silent
morose
and
anything
but
delightful
as
a
daily
companion
to
betty
he
had
become
the
unsolvable
enigma
that
this
most
unhappy
change
should
have
been
brought
about
by
the
breaking
of
the
venetian
tear
vase
she
could
not
believe
valuable
and
highly
treasured
as
it
was
yet
as
she
looked
back
the
change
seemed
to
have
dated
from
the
moment
of
the
vase
shattering
on
the
library
floor
the
day
after
christmas
at
first
she
had
supposed
the
man
sudden
reversion
to
gloom
and
silence
was
a
mere
whim
of
the
mind
or
a
passing
distemper
of
the
body
but
when
day
after
day
brought
no
light
to
his
eye
no
smile
to
his
lip
no
elasticity
to
his
step
she
became
seriously
disturbed
particularly
as
she
could
not
help
noticing
that
he
no
longer
worked
with
her
that
he
no
longer
in
fact
seemed
to
want
to
remain
in
the
library
even
to
hear
her
read
to
him
she
was
sorely
troubled
not
only
did
she
miss
the
pleasure
and
stimulus
of
his
presence
and
interest
in
the
work
but
she
feared
lest
in
some
way
she
had
disappointed
or
offended
him
she
began
to
question
herself
and
to
examine
critically
her
work
she
could
find
nothing
her
work
had
been
well
done
she
knew
that
there
was
absolutely
no
excuse
for
this
sudden
taciturn
aloofness
on
his
part
after
all
it
was
probably
nothing
more
than
what
might
be
expected
of
him
a
going
back
to
his
usual
self
without
doubt
the
strange
thing
was
not
that
he
was
stern
and
silent
and
morose
now
but
that
for
a
brief
golden
period
he
had
come
out
of
his
shell
and
acted
like
a
human
being
doubtless
it
was
under
the
sway
of
his
interest
in
his
curios
and
his
first
delight
at
seeing
them
being
brought
into
something
like
order
that
he
had
for
a
moment
as
it
were
stirred
into
something
really
human
and
his
going
back
to
his
original
sour
unpleasantness
now
was
merely
a
reversion
to
first
principles
that
it
should
be
so
vexed
betty
not
a
little
and
when
they
were
having
such
a
good
time
surely
for
a
man
that
be
so
altogether
charming
and
delightful
to
be
habitually
so
extremely
undesirable
and
disagreeable
was
most
exasperating
and
he
had
been
such
good
company
how
kind
he
had
been
too
when
she
had
told
him
so
much
of
her
own
life
and
home
how
interested
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
in
every
little
detail
just
as
if
he
really
cared
and
now
with
a
tense
biting
of
her
lip
betty
reproached
herself
bitterly
for
being
so
free
to
tell
of
her
own
small
affairs
she
ought
to
have
known
that
any
interest
a
man
like
that
could
show
was
bound
to
be
superficial
and
insincere
what
a
pity
she
should
lose
for
once
her
reserve
well
at
least
she
had
learned
her
lesson
never
again
would
she
be
guilty
of
making
a
confidant
of
burke
denby
no
matter
how
suave
and
he
might
elect
to
become
for
some
other
brief
week
in
the
future
to
her
mother
betty
said
very
little
of
all
this
true
at
the
first
in
her
surprise
at
the
remarkable
change
in
her
employer
attitude
she
had
told
her
mother
of
his
reversion
to
gloom
and
sternness
but
it
had
seemed
to
worry
and
disturb
her
mother
so
much
that
betty
had
stopped
at
once
and
always
since
then
she
had
avoided
speaking
of
his
continued
disagreeableness
and
skillfully
evaded
answering
pertinent
questions
she
told
herself
that
she
realized
of
course
it
was
because
her
mother
was
so
fearful
that
something
would
happen
that
this
fine
position
with
the
generous
pay
should
be
lost
dear
mother
who
thought
she
was
hiding
so
shrewdly
the
fact
of
how
poor
they
were
there
was
something
else
that
betty
did
not
tell
her
mother
also
and
that
was
of
her
first
peculiar
and
annoying
experience
with
the
woman
at
the
newsstand
at
the
station
it
was
about
two
weeks
after
christmas
that
betty
had
first
seen
the
woman
denby
had
asked
her
to
go
around
by
the
station
on
her
way
home
and
purchase
for
him
the
december
issue
of
research
he
said
it
was
not
a
very
popular
magazine
and
that
the
woman
was
one
of
the
few
agents
in
town
who
kept
it
for
sale
there
was
an
article
on
babylonian
tablets
in
the
december
number
and
he
wished
to
see
it
the
station
was
not
very
far
from
her
home
and
betty
was
glad
to
do
the
errand
of
course
but
when
she
arrived
at
the
newsstand
she
found
a
most
offensive
person
who
annoyed
her
with
questions
a
large
woman
with
unpleasantly
prominent
eyes
and
a
wart
on
her
chin
yes
miss
i
got
the
magazine
right
here
she
said
with
alacrity
in
reply
to
betty
request
but
say
hai
i
seen
you
before
somewheres
betty
shook
her
head
i
do
think
so
she
smiled
at
least
i
do
not
remember
seeing
you
anywhere
well
do
you
come
here
often
to
the
station
or
somethin
persisted
the
woman
no
i
have
never
been
here
before
except
the
day
i
arrived
in
town
last
september
funny
frowned
the
woman
musingly
i
a
great
case
fur
faces
an
i
do
very
often
make
a
mistake
i
could
swear
i
seen
you
somewheres
betty
smiled
and
shook
her
head
again
as
she
turned
away
with
her
magazine
twice
after
that
denby
had
sent
her
to
this
same
newsstand
for
a
desired
periodical
and
on
both
occasions
the
woman
had
been
cheerfully
insistent
in
her
questions
and
in
her
reiterations
that
somewhere
she
certainly
had
seen
her
as
she
never
made
mistakes
in
faces
an
yer
workin
fur
burke
denby
on
the
hill
ai
ye
she
asked
at
last
betty
colored
i
am
working
for
mr
denby
yes
like
him
if
you
give
me
my
change
please
requested
betty
then
the
flush
deepening
on
her
cheeks
i
am
in
some
haste
the
woman
laughed
none
too
pleasantly
you
do
want
ter
answer
an
i
ai
sayin
i
wonder
she
chuckled
he
a
queer
bug
an
no
mistake
an
i
do
wonder
ye
do
like
him
on
the
contrary
i
like
him
very
much
flashed
betty
hurriedly
catching
up
her
magazine
and
almost
snatching
the
coins
from
the
woman
hand
in
her
haste
to
be
away
betty
had
not
told
her
mother
of
these
encounters
more
and
more
plainly
betty
was
seeing
how
keenly
averse
to
meeting
people
her
mother
was
and
how
evasive
she
was
in
her
answers
to
the
questions
the
sometimes
put
to
her
instinctively
betty
felt
that
these
questions
of
the
newsstand
woman
would
distress
her
mother
very
much
so
betty
kept
them
carefully
to
herself
the
conviction
that
her
mother
was
fearful
of
meeting
old
friends
in
dalton
was
growing
on
betty
these
days
and
it
disturbed
her
greatly
moreover
she
did
not
like
a
certain
growing
restless
nervousness
in
her
mother
manner
nor
did
she
like
the
increasing
pallor
of
her
cheek
something
somewhere
was
wrong
of
this
betty
became
more
and
more
strongly
convinced
nor
did
a
little
episode
that
took
place
late
in
january
tend
to
weaken
this
belief
they
had
gone
to
market
betty
and
her
mother
lured
by
an
attractive
ad
they
had
gone
farther
from
home
than
usual
and
were
in
a
store
not
often
visited
by
them
they
had
given
their
order
and
turned
to
go
when
suddenly
betty
found
herself
whisked
about
by
her
mother
frantic
clutch
on
her
arm
and
led
swiftly
quite
across
the
store
to
the
opposite
door
there
still
impelled
by
that
unyielding
clutch
on
her
arm
she
found
herself
dodging
in
and
out
of
the
throngs
of
customers
on
their
way
to
the
street
outside
even
there
their
pace
did
not
slacken
until
they
were
well
around
the
corner
of
the
block
why
mother
panted
betty
then
laughing
i
should
think
you
were
running
away
from
all
the
plagues
of
egypt
i
i
was
worse
than
the
plagues
of
egypt
laughed
her
mother
a
bit
hysterically
why
mother
cried
betty
growing
suddenly
alert
and
anxious
there
there
dear
it
was
nothing
never
mind
declared
her
mother
but
even
as
she
spoke
she
looked
back
fearfully
over
her
shoulder
but
mother
what
it
nothing
just
a
a
woman
i
did
want
to
see
i
used
to
know
her
years
ago
and
she
was
such
a
talker
we
would
have
got
home
but
we
sha
now
if
we
keep
on
this
way
laughed
betty
uneasily
her
troubled
eyes
on
her
mother
face
we
going
in
quite
the
opposite
direction
from
home
dear
dear
so
we
are
we
must
have
turned
the
wrong
way
when
we
came
out
from
the
store
yes
we
did
agreed
betty
her
words
were
light
but
the
troubled
look
had
not
left
her
eyes
chapter
xxvi
the
road
to
understanding
it
was
on
a
gray
morning
early
in
february
that
betty
found
her
employer
pacing
the
library
from
end
to
end
like
the
proverbial
caged
lion
when
he
turned
and
spoke
she
was
startled
at
the
look
on
his
face
a
worn
haggard
look
that
told
of
sleeplessness
and
of
something
else
that
she
could
not
name
he
ignored
her
conventional
morning
greeting
miss
darling
i
want
to
speak
to
you
yes
mr
denby
will
you
come
here
to
live
as
my
daughter
will
i
what
the
amazement
in
betty
face
was
obviously
genuine
you
are
surprised
of
course
and
no
wonder
i
did
exactly
what
you
call
it
gently
did
i
and
i
forgot
that
you
have
been
thinking
of
this
thing
every
minute
for
the
last
er
month
as
i
have
wo
you
sit
down
please
with
an
abrupt
gesture
he
motioned
her
to
a
chair
and
dropped
into
one
himself
i
ca
of
course
beat
about
the
bush
now
i
want
you
to
come
here
to
this
house
and
be
a
daughter
to
me
will
you
but
is
so
sudden
yes
i
know
smiled
the
man
grimly
that
what
your
face
says
and
no
wonder
it
may
seem
sudden
to
you
but
it
is
not
at
all
so
to
me
believe
me
i
have
given
it
a
great
deal
of
thought
i
have
debated
it
longer
than
you
can
guess
and
let
me
tell
you
at
once
that
of
course
i
want
your
mother
to
come
too
that
will
set
your
mind
at
rest
on
that
point
but
i
i
do
think
yet
that
i
i
quite
understand
faltered
the
girl
in
what
way
i
ca
understand
yet
why
why
you
want
me
you
see
i
i
have
thought
lately
that
that
you
positively
disliked
me
mr
denby
her
chin
came
up
with
the
little
determined
lift
so
like
her
mother
with
a
jerk
burke
denby
got
to
his
feet
and
resumed
his
nervous
stride
up
and
down
the
room
my
child
he
turned
squarely
about
and
faced
her
i
want
you
i
need
you
this
house
has
become
nothing
but
a
dreary
old
pile
of
horror
to
me
you
by
some
sweet
necromancy
of
your
own
have
contrived
to
make
the
sun
shine
into
its
windows
it
the
first
time
for
years
that
there
has
been
any
sun
for
me
but
when
you
go
the
sun
goes
that
why
i
want
you
here
all
the
time
will
you
come
of
course
you
understand
i
mean
adoption
legally
but
i
do
want
to
dwell
on
that
part
i
want
you
to
to
come
i
want
you
to
be
happy
here
wo
you
come
betty
drew
in
her
breath
tremulously
for
a
long
minute
her
gaze
searched
the
man
face
well
miss
betty
there
was
a
confident
smile
in
his
eyes
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
made
a
certain
somewhat
dreaded
move
but
who
has
no
doubt
as
to
the
outcome
i
afraid
i
ca
mr
denby
you
betty
in
spite
of
her
very
real
and
serious
concern
and
anxiety
almost
laughed
at
the
absolute
amazement
on
the
man
face
no
mr
denby
may
i
ask
why
there
was
the
chill
of
ice
in
his
voice
again
betty
felt
the
almost
hysterical
desire
to
laugh
still
her
face
was
very
grave
you
i
in
the
end
you
would
not
want
me
denby
she
faltered
because
i
i
should
not
be
happy
here
may
i
ask
why
there
was
no
answer
miss
darling
why
would
you
be
happy
here
genuine
distress
came
into
betty
face
i
would
rather
not
say
mr
denby
but
i
prefer
that
you
should
i
ca
you
would
think
me
impertinent
not
if
i
tell
you
to
say
it
miss
betty
why
ca
you
be
happy
here
you
know
very
well
that
you
would
have
everything
that
money
could
buy
but
what
i
want
is
something
money
ca
buy
what
do
you
mean
no
reply
miss
darling
what
do
you
mean
with
a
sudden
fierce
recklessness
the
girl
turned
and
faced
him
i
mean
just
that
what
you
did
now
and
a
minute
ago
the
way
you
have
of
of
expecting
everybody
and
everything
to
bend
to
your
will
and
wishes
oh
i
know
it
silly
and
horrible
and
everything
for
me
to
say
this
but
you
me
do
it
i
told
you
it
was
impertinent
you
see
i
have
to
have
love
and
laughter
and
sympathy
and
interest
and
and
all
that
around
me
i
be
happy
here
this
house
is
like
a
tomb
and
you
sometimes
you
are
jolly
and
kind
and
and
but
i
never
know
you
going
to
be
and
i
die
if
i
had
to
worry
and
fret
and
fear
all
the
time
how
you
going
to
be
denby
i
i
could
live
in
such
a
place
and
mother
could
either
and
i
oh
what
have
i
said
but
you
made
me
do
it
you
made
me
do
it
for
one
long
minute
there
was
utter
silence
in
the
room
burke
denby
at
the
library
table
sat
motionless
his
hand
shading
his
eyes
betty
in
her
chair
wet
her
lips
and
swallowed
convulsively
her
eyes
were
frightened
but
her
chin
was
high
suddenly
he
stirred
his
hand
no
longer
shaded
his
face
betty
to
her
amazement
saw
that
his
lips
were
smiling
though
his
eyes
she
knew
were
moist
betty
my
dear
child
i
thought
before
that
i
wanted
you
i
know
now
i
to
have
you
betty
as
if
the
smile
were
contagious
found
her
own
lips
twitching
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
your
fearless
little
tirade
was
just
what
i
needed
my
dear
i
expected
everything
and
everybody
to
bend
to
my
will
and
wishes
i
suspect
that
what
been
the
matter
too
all
the
way
up
i
thought
once
long
ago
i
learned
my
lesson
but
it
seems
i
have
here
i
am
up
to
the
same
old
tricks
again
will
you
come
and
er
train
me
betty
i
will
promise
to
be
very
docile
betty
did
laugh
this
time
and
the
tension
snapped
train
the
very
word
with
which
she
had
shocked
her
mother
weeks
before
seriously
my
dear
the
man
face
was
very
grave
now
i
want
you
to
talk
this
thing
over
with
your
mother
i
am
a
lonely
old
man
yes
old
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
barely
forty
i
feel
sixty
i
want
you
and
i
need
you
and
notwithstanding
your
unflattering
opinion
of
me
just
expressed
i
believe
i
can
make
you
happy
and
your
mother
too
she
shall
have
every
comfort
and
you
shall
have
love
and
laughter
and
sympathy
and
interest
i
promise
you
now
is
your
heart
softening
just
a
wee
bit
you
come
why
of
course
i
appreciate
your
kindness
denby
and
betty
drew
a
tremulous
breath
and
looked
wistfully
into
the
man
pleading
eyes
it
would
be
lovely
for
mother
would
it
she
would
have
to
worry
any
more
or
or
burke
denby
lifted
an
imperative
hand
his
face
lighted
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
spoke
with
boyish
enthusiasm
the
very
thing
miss
darling
i
want
you
to
go
home
and
bring
your
mother
back
to
luncheon
with
you
never
mind
the
work
he
went
on
as
he
saw
her
quick
glance
toward
his
desk
i
do
want
to
work
i
could
this
morning
and
i
do
want
you
to
i
want
to
see
your
mother
i
want
to
tell
her
many
things
of
myself
i
want
her
to
see
me
and
see
if
she
thinks
she
could
give
you
to
me
as
a
daughter
and
yet
not
lose
you
herself
but
come
here
with
you
to
live
but
i
i
could
tell
her
this
stammered
betty
knowing
still
that
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
being
swept
quite
off
her
feet
by
the
extraordinary
enthusiasm
of
the
eager
man
before
her
i
do
want
to
wait
till
i
want
to
see
her
now
besides
he
cocked
his
head
whimsically
with
the
confident
air
of
one
who
knows
his
point
is
gained
i
want
a
magazine
and
i
forgot
to
ask
you
to
get
it
for
me
last
night
i
want
the
february
so
we
just
let
it
go
that
i
sending
you
to
the
station
newsstand
for
that
incidentally
you
may
come
back
around
by
your
mother
place
and
bring
her
with
you
there
now
surely
you
wo
object
to
to
running
an
errand
for
me
he
finished
triumphantly
no
i
surely
ca
object
to
to
running
an
errand
for
you
laughed
betty
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
a
pretty
color
in
her
face
and
i
i
try
to
bring
mother
it
was
in
a
tumult
of
excitement
and
indecision
that
betty
hurried
down
the
long
denby
walk
that
february
morning
what
would
her
mother
say
how
would
she
take
it
would
she
consent
would
she
consent
even
to
go
to
luncheon
she
who
so
seldom
went
anywhere
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
this
proposal
of
denby
it
meant
of
course
everything
if
they
accepted
it
a
complete
metamorphosis
of
their
whole
lives
and
future
it
could
not
help
meaning
that
but
would
they
be
happy
there
could
they
be
happy
with
a
man
like
denby
to
be
sure
he
said
he
would
be
willing
to
be
trained
betty
face
dimpled
into
a
broad
smile
somewhat
to
the
mystification
of
the
man
she
chanced
to
be
meeting
at
the
moment
but
would
he
be
really
kind
and
lovable
like
this
all
the
time
he
had
been
delightful
once
before
for
a
few
days
what
guaranty
had
they
that
he
would
not
again
at
the
first
provocation
fall
back
into
his
old
glum
unbearableness
but
what
would
her
mother
say
well
she
would
soon
know
she
would
get
the
magazine
then
hurry
home
and
find
out
it
was
between
trains
at
the
station
and
the
was
deserted
betty
hurriedly
told
the
newsstand
woman
what
she
wanted
and
tried
to
assume
a
forbidding
aspect
that
would
discourage
questions
but
the
woman
made
no
move
to
get
the
magazine
she
did
not
seem
even
to
have
heard
the
request
instead
she
leaned
over
the
counter
and
caught
betty
arm
in
a
grip
her
face
was
alight
with
joyous
excitement
well
i
am
glad
to

of
relief

her
face

with
her
free
hand

paled
the
vague
questions
and
fears
regarding
her
mother
actions
for
the
past
few
months

suddenly
to
be
taking
horrible
shape
and
definiteness

alive

know
that
burke

down
ter
martin
grocery
last
night
at
nine
well
you
there
with
yer
mother
a
power
entirely
outside
of
herself
seemed
to
force
the
answers
from
betty
lips
well
i
see
ye
you
was
tergether
talkin
to
the
big
fat
man
with
the
red

i
started
towards

but
i
lost

in
the
crowd
betty
face
had
grown
she
remembered
now
that
was
the
night
her
mother
had
run
away
from
something
but
i
knew
her
nodded
the
woman
i
knew
she
was
helen
denby
but
maybe
you
were
mistaken
mistaken
me
not
much
i
do
furgit
faces
you
ask
yer
mother
if
she
do
remember
mis
cobb
did
i
live
right
on
the
same
floor
with
her
fur
months
hai
yer
mother
ever
told
ye
she
lived
here
long
ago
betty
nodded
dumbly
miserably
well
i
lived
next
to
her
and
i
knew
the
whole
thing
how
she
got
the
letter
tellin
her
ter
go
an
the
money
burke
denby
sent
her
letter
money
you
mean
he
wrote
her
to
go
away
he
her
the
girl
had
become
suddenly
galvanized
into
blazing
anger
sure
that
what
i
tellin
ye
an
yer
mother
went
i
tried
ter
stop
her
i
told
her
ter
go
straight
up
ter
them
denbys
an
demand
her
rights
an
rights
but
she
would
she
had
a
mite
o
spunk
just
because
he
was
ashamed
of
her
she
ashamed
of
her
of
my
mother
if
but
helen
denby
could
have
seen
the
flash
in
betty
eyes
sure
she
so
tony
an
her
folks
grand
like
his
ye
know
that
why
old
denby
objected
ter
the
marriage
in
the
first
place
but
say
did
you
know
any
of
this
i
tellin
ye
jiminy
but
it
does
seem
queer
ter
be
tellin
ye
yer
own
family
secrets
like
this
an
you
here
workin
in
his
very
home
an
not
knowin
it
too
if
that
the
limit
like
a
regular
now
i
ai
never
one
ter
butt
in
where
none
of
my
affairs
but
i
got
ter
say
this
you
a
denby
an
ought
ter
have
some
spunk
an
if
i
was
you
i
brace
right
up
an
here
do
ye
want
yer
magazine
what
are
ye
goin
ter
do
but
the
girl
was
already
halfway
across
the
if
betty
thoughts
and
emotions
had
been
in
a
tumult
on
the
way
to
the
station
they
were
in
a
veritable
chaos
on
the
return
trip
she
did
not
go
home
she
turned
her
steps
toward
the
denby
mansion
and
because
she
knew
she
could
not
possibly
sit
still
she
walked
all
the
way
so
this
was
the
meaning
of
it
the
black
veil
daytimes
the
walks
only
at
night
the
nervous
restlessness
the
unhappiness
her
mother
had
something
to
conceal
something
to
fear
poor
mother
dear
mother
how
she
must
have
suffered
but
why
had
she
come
back
here
and
put
her
into
that
man
home
and
why
had
she
told
her
always
how
fine
and
noble
and
splendid
her
father
was
fine
noble
splendid
indeed
still
it
was
like
mother
dear
mother
always
so
sweet
and
gentle
always
seeing
the
good
in
everything
and
everybody
but
why
had
she
put
her
there
in
that
man
house
how
could
she
have
done
it
and
burke
denby
himself
did
he
know
did
he
suspect
that
she
was
his
daughter
adopt
her
indeed
was
the
way
he
thought
he
could
pay
her
mother
back
for
all
those
years
and
the
grief
and
the
hurt
and
the
mortification
where
did
they
come
in
ashamed
of
her
of
her
indeed
why
her
little
finger
was
as
much
finer
and
nobler
and
but
just
wait
till
she
saw
him
that
was
all
like
the
overwrought
young
hurricane
of
wrathfulness
that
she
was
betty
burst
into
the
library
at
denby
house
a
few
minutes
later
the
very
sight
of
her
face
brought
the
man
to
his
feet
why
betty
what
the
matter
where
your
mother
could
she
come
what
is
the
matter
come
no
she
did
come
she
never
come
never
before
the
blazing
wrath
in
the
young
eyes
the
man
fell
back
limply
why
betty
did
you
tell
her
i
told
her
nothing
i
have
seen
her
cut
in
the
girl
crisply
but
i
seen
somebody
else
i
know
now
everything
from
sheer
stupefaction
the
man
laughed
are
we
getting
a
little
theatrical
my
child
he
murmured
mildly
you
need
call
me
that
i
refuse
to
recognize
the
relationship
she
flamed
perhaps
we
are
getting
theatrical
that
woman
said
it
was
like
a
and
perhaps
you
thought
you
could
wipe
it
all
out
by
adopting
me
adopting
me
indeed
as
if
i
let
you
i
can
tell
you
it
is
going
to
like
a
with
father
and
mother
and
daughter
they
all
lived
happily
ever
after
because
i
wo
let
it
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
man
face
had
grown
suddenly
very
white
betty
fixed
searching
accusing
eyes
on
his
countenance
are
you
trying
to
make
me
think
you
do
know
i
your
daughter
that
betty
are
you
really
really
my
little
betty
at
the
joyous
cry
and
the
eagerly
outstretched
arms
betty
shrank
back
then
you
know
that
no
no
oh
betty
betty
is
it
true
then
it
all
be
right
now
oh
betty
i
so
glad
he
choked
my
little
girl
wo
you
come
to
me
she
shook
her
head
and
retreated
still
farther
out
of
his
reach
her
eyes
still
blazed
angrily
betty
dear
hear
me
i
do
know
i
do
understand
it
all
too
wonderful
to
have
it
come
once
for
a
little
minute
the
wild
thought
came
to
me
that
you
might
be
but
betty
you
yourself
told
me
your
father
was
dead
and
so
he
is
to
me
sobbed
betty
you
are
my
father
my
father
was
good
and
true
and
noble
and
you
and
your
mother
you
that
breathed
the
man
brokenly
betty
i
i
where
is
she
is
she
there
at
home
now
i
want
to
see
her
i
sha
let
you
see
her
betty
had
blazed
again
into
unreasoning
wrath
you
do
deserve
it
you
told
her
you
were
ashamed
of
her
of
her
and
she
the
best
and
the
loveliest
and
dearest
mother
in
the
world
she
as
much
above
and
beyond
anything
you
you
she
let
me
come
to
you
i
do
know
i
ca
think
why
she
did
it
but
now
i
i
betty
if
you
only
let
me
explain
but
the
great
hall
door
had
banged
shut
betty
had
gone
betty
took
a
car
to
her
own
home
she
was
too
weak
and
spent
to
walk
it
was
a
very
white
shaken
betty
that
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
little
apartment
a
short
time
later
why
betty
darling
exclaimed
her
mother
hurrying
forward
you
are
ill
are
you
ill
with
utter
weariness
betty
dropped
into
a
chair
mother
why
did
you
tell
me
she
asked
dully
heartbrokenly
why
did
you
let
me
come
here
and
go
to
that
house
day
after
day
and
not
know
anything
why
what

betty
springing
to
her
feet
in
sudden
frenzy
again

let
me
go
there
and
only
this
morning

told
me

to
adopt

to
and

i
told
him
i
knew
everything
now
and
that
he
think
he
could
wipe
it
out
and
he
wanted
to
see
you
and
i
said
he
could
i
an
electric
bell
pealed
sharply
through
the
tiny
apartment
mother
that
he
i
know
it
he
mother
do
let
him
in
implored
betty
but
her
mother
already
was
in
the
hall
betty
frightened
despairing
and
angry
turned
her
back
and
walked
to
the
window
she
heard
the
man
quick
cry
and
the
woman
sobbing
answer
she
heard
the
broken
incoherent
sentences
with
which
the
man
and
the
woman
attempted
to
crowd
into
one
brief
delirious
minute
all
the
long
years
of
heartache
and
absence
she
heard
the
pleading
the
the
final
rapturous
bliss
that
vibrated
through
every
tone
and
word
but
she
did
not
turn
she
did
not
turn
even
when
some
minutes
later
her
father
voice
low
unsteady
but
infinitely
tender
reached
her
ears
betty
your
mother
has
forgiven
me
ca
you
there
was
no
answer
betty
dear
he
means
we
forgiven
each
other
and
if
am
happy
ca
you
be
begged
betty
mother
tremulously
still
no
answer
betty
began
the
woman
again
pleadingly
but
the
man
interposed
a
little
sadly
do
urge
her
helen
after
all
i
deserve
everything
she
can
say
or
do
but
she
does
understand
faltered
helen
the
man
shook
his
head
a
wistful
smile
was
on
his
lips
no
she
does
understand
he
said
it
a
long
road
to
understanding
dear
you
and
i
have
found
it
so
yes
i
know
helen
voice
was
very
low
and
there
are
sticks
and
stones
and
numberless
twigs
to
trip
feet
went
on
the
man
softly
and
there
are
valleys
of
despair
and
mountains
of
doubt
to
be
encountered
and
betty
has
come
only
a
little
bit
of
the
way
betty
is
young
but
it
was
helen
tremulous
voice
it
on
the
that
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
see
the
end
of
the
journey
you
know
yes
but
there
are
all
those
guideboards
remember
said
the
man
and
betty
has
come
to
the
guideboards
yet
regret
remorse
forgiveness
patience
and
atonement
there
was
a
sudden
movement
at
the
window
then
betty
stood
before
them
i
know
i
am
on
the
mountain
of
doubt
now
but
she
paused
her
gaze
going
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
wondrously
glorified
faces
before
her
i
try
so
hard
to
see
the
end
of
the
journey
she
faltered
betty
sobbed
two
adoring
voices
as
loving
arms
enfolded
her
