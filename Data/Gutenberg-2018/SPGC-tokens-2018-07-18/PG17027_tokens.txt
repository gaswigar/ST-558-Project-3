note
about

story
this

from
my
collection
a
place
so
foreign
and
eight
more
published
by

eight
windows
press
in
september
isbn
released
this
story
along
with
five
others
under
the
terms
of
a
creative
commons
license
that
gives
you
the
reader
a
bunch
of
rights
that
copyright
normally
reserves
for
me
the
creator
i
recently
did
the
same
thing
with
the
entire
text
of
my
novel
down
and
out
in
the
magic
kingdom
http
and
it
was
an
unmitigated
success
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
downloaded
the
book
good
news
and
thousands
of
people
bought
the
book
also
good
news
it
turns
out
that
as
near
as
anyone
can
tell
distributing
free
electronic
versions
of
books
is
a
great
way
to
sell
more
of
the
paper
editions
while
simultaneously
getting
the
book
into
the
hands
of
readers
who
would
otherwise
not
be
exposed
to
my
work
i
still
do
know
how
it
is
artists
will
earn
a
living
in
the
age
of
the
internet
but
i
remain
convinced
that
the
way
to
find
out
is
to
do
basic
science
that
is
to
do
stuff
and
observe
the
outcome
that
what
i
doing
here
the
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
very
thing
you
can
do
to
me
as
an
artist
is
to
not
read
my
work
to
let
it
languish
in
obscurity
and
disappear
from
posterity
most
of
the
fiction
i
grew
up
on
is
and
this
is
doubly
true
for
the
short
stories
losing
a
couple
bucks
to
people
who
would
have
bought
the
book
save
for
the
availability
of
the
free
electronic
text
is
no
big
deal
at
least
when
compared
to
the
horror
that
is
being
irrelevant
and
unread
and
luckily
for
me
it
appears
that
giving
away
the
text
for
free
gets
me
more
paying
customers
than
it
loses
me

george
twiddled
his
thumbs
in

booth
and
watched
how
the
brown
clayey
knuckles
danced
overtop
of
one
another
not
as
supple
as
they
had
once
been
his
thumbs
no
longer
the
texture
of
wet
clay
on

potter
wheel
more
like
clay
after
it
had
been
worked
to
exhausted
crackling
and
brittleness
he
reached
into
the
swirling
vortex
of
the
machine
with
his
strong
right
hand
and
caught
the
the
engines
whined
and
he
felt
them
strain
against
his
strong
right
arm
like
a
live
thing
struggling
to
escape
a
trap
still
strong
he
thought
still
strong
and
he
released

to
go
back
to
spinning
sugar
into
floss
a
pack
of
boys
sauntered
down
the
midway
laughing
and
calling
bouncing
high
on
sugar
and
one
of
them
peeled
off
from
the
group
and
ran
to
his
booth
still
laughing
at
some
cruelty
he
put
his
palms
on
george
counter
and
pushed
against
it
using
them
to
lever
his
little
body
in
a
pogo
hey
mister
he
said
how
about
some
swirl
with
sprinkles
george
smiled
and
knocked
the
rack
of
paper
cones
with
his
strong
right
elbow
jostled
it
so
one
cone
spun
high
in
the
air
and
he
caught
it
in
his
quick
left
hand
coming
up
he
sang
and
flipped
the
cone
into
the
he
spun
a
beehive
of
pink
then
layered
it
with
stripes
of
blue
and
green
he
reached
for
the
nipple
that
dispensed
the
sprinkles
but
before
he
turned
its
spigot
he
said
are
you
sure
you
do
want
a
dip
too
fudge
butterscotch
strawberry
the
boy
bounced
even
higher
so
that
he
was
nearly
vaulting
the
counter
all
three
all
three
he
said
george
expertly
spiraled
the
floss
through
the
dips
then
applied
a
thick
crust
of
sprinkles
open
your
mouth
kid
he
shouted
with
realistic
glee
the
boy
opened
his
mouth
wide
so
that
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
midway
reflected
off
his
back
molars
and
the
pool
of
saliva
on
his
tongue
quick
clever
left
hand
dipped
a
spoon
into
the
hot
fudge
then
flipped
the
sticky
gob
on
a
high
arc
that
terminated
perfectly
in
the
boy
open
mouth
the
boy
swallowed
and
laughed
gooely
george
handed
over
the
dripping
confection
in
his
strong
right
hand
and
the
boy
plunged
his
face
into
it
when
he
whirled
and
ran
to
rejoin
his
friends
george
saw
that
his
ears
were
already
getting
longer
and
his
delighted
laugh
had
sounded
a
little
like
a
bray
a
job
well
done
he
thought
and
watched
the
rain
spatter
the
spongy
rubber
cobbles
of
the
midway
george
was
supposed
to
go
at
midnight
he
always
showed
up
promptly
at
noon
but
he
rarely
left
as
punctually
the
soft
one
who
had
the
shift
was
lazy
and
late
and
generally
staggered
in
at
twelve
thirty
grumbling
about
his
tiredness
george
knew
how
to
deal
with
the
soft
ones
though
his
father
had
brought
him
up
surrounded
by
them
so
that
he
spoke
without
his
father
thick
accent
so
that
he
never
inadvertently
crushed
their
soft
hands
when
he
shook
with
them
so
that
he
smiled
and
gave
up
a
realistic
facsimile
of
sympathy
when
they
griped
their
perennial
gripes
his
father
how
wise
the
old
man
had
been
and
how
proud
and
how
george
shucked
his
uniform
backstage
and
tossed
it
into
a
laundry
hamper
noting
with
dismay
how
brown
the
insides
were
how
much
of
himself
had
eroded
away
during
his
shift
he
looked
at
his
clever
left
thumb
and
his
strong
right
thumb
and
tasted
their
good
earthy
tastes
and
then
put
them
away
he
dressed
himself
in
the
dungarees
and
workshirt
that
his
own
father
had
stolen
from
a
laundry
line
when
he
left
the
ancestral
home
of
george
people
for
the
society
of
the
soft
ones
he
boarded
a
cast
member
tram
that
ran
through
the
ultidors
underneath
pleasure
island
midway
and
stared
aimlessly
at
nothing
as
the
soft
ones
on
the
tram
gabbled
away
as
the
tram
sped
away
to
the
cast
housing
and
then
it
was
just
him
and
the
conductor
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
line
to
the
cottage
he
shared
with
his
two
brothers
bill
and
joe
the
conductor
wished
him
a
good
night
when
he
debarked
and
he
shambled
home
bill
was
already
home
napping
in
the
pile
of
blankets
that
all
three
brothers
shared
in
the
back
room
of
the
cottage
joe
was
home
yet
even
though
his
shift
finished
earlier
than
theirs
he
never
came
straight
home
instead
he
wandered
backstage
watching
the
midway
through
the
peepholes
joe
lead
had
spoken
to
george
about
it
and
george
had
spoken
to
joe
but
you
could
tell
joe
anything
george
thought
of
how
proud
his
father
had
been
having
three
sons
three
george
the
son
of
his
strong
right
thumb
and
bill
the
son
of
his
clever
left
thumb
and
joe
joe
the
son
of
his
tongue
an
old
man
folly
that
left
him
wordless
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
he
had
needed
words
though
his
cracked
and
rheumy
eyes
had
shone
with
pride
every
time
they
lit
on
joe
and
the
boy
could
do
no
wrong
by
him
george
busied
himself
with
supper
for
his
brothers
in
the
little
wooded
area
behind
the
cottage
he
found
good
clean
earth
with
juicy
roots
in
it
in
the
freezer
he
had
a
jar
of
sauce
spiced
with
the
sweat
of
the
big
top
acrobats
leotards
which
even
after
reheating
still
carried
the
tang
of
vitality
preparing
a
good
meal
for
his
kind
meant
a
balance
of
earthy
things
and
living
things
things
to
keep
the
hands
supple
and
things
to
make
them
strong
and
so
he
brought
in
a
chicken
from
the
brothers
henhouse
and
covered
it
in
the
sloppy
sauce
feathers
and
all
bill
being
the
clever
one
woke
when
the
smell
of
the
sauce
bubbling
in
the
microwave
reached
him
and
he
wandered
into
the
kitchen
to
an
untutored
eye
bill
and
george
were
indistinguishable
both
of
them
big
even
for
their
kind
for
their
father
had
been
an
especially
big
specimen
himself
whose
faces
were
as
expressive
as
sculptor
clay
whose
teeth
were
white
and
hard
as
rocks
when
they
were
alone
together
they
went
without
clothing
as
was
the
custom
of
their
kind
and
their
bodies
bulged
with
baggy
loose
muscle
they
needed
no
clothing
for
they
lacked
the
shame
of
the
soft
ones
the
small
thumb
between
the
legs
they
had
a
more
civilised
way
of
reproducing
joe
has
returned
yet
bill
asked
his
strong
brother
not
yet
george
told
his
clever
brother
we
eat
then
no
sense
in
waiting
for
him
he
knows
the
supper
hour
bill
said
and
since
he
was
the
clever
one
they
ate
joe
returned
as
the
sun
was
rising
and
burrowed
in
between
his
brothers
on
their
nest
of
blankets
george
flung
one
leg
over
his
smallest
brother
and
smelled
the
liquor
on
his
breath
in
his
sleep
and
his
dreams
were
tainted
with
the
stink
of
rotting
grapes
george
was
the
first
one
awake
preparing
the
morning
meal
a
maggoty
side
of
beef
ripe
with
the
vitality
of
its
parasites
and
gravel
joe
came
for
breakfast
before
bill
as
was
his
custom
bill
needed
the
sleep
to
rest
his
cleverness
i
am
joe
said
loudly
without
regard
for
his
sleeping
brother
you
missed
dinner
george
said
i
had
more
important
things
to
do
joe
said
i
was
out
with
an
imagineer
george
stared
hard
at
him
what
did
the
imagineer
want
is
there
trouble
joe
gave
a
deprecating
laugh
why
do
you
always
think
there
trouble
the
guy
wanted
to
chat
with
me
he
likes
me
wants
to
get
to
know
me
his
name
is
woodrow
he
in
charge
of
a
whole
operations
division
and
he
was
interested
in
what
i
thought
of
some
of
his
plans
he
stopped
and
waited
for
george
to
be
impressed
george
knew
what
the
pause
was
for
that
very
good
you
must
be
doing
a
good
job
for
your
lead
to
mention
you
to
him
that
little
prick
he
hates
my
guts
woodrow
building
a
special
operations
unit
out
of
lateral
thinkers
he
wants
new
blood
creativity
he
says
i
have
a
unique
perspective
did
you
talk
to
orville
orville
was
the
soft
one
who
brought
them
from
their
father
shack
to
the
island
and
he
was
their
mentor
and
advocate
inside
its
byzantine
politics
bill
had
confided
to
george
that
he
suspected
orville
was
of
a
different
species
from
the
soft
ones
he
certainly
seemed
to
know
more
about
george
kind
than
a
soft
one
had
any
business
knowing
joe
tore
a
hunk
from
the
carcass
on
the
rickety
kitchen
table
and
stuffed
it
into
his
mouth
around
it
he
mumbled
something
that
might
have
been
yes
and
might
have
been
no
it
was
joe
favorite
stratagem
and
it
was
responsible
for
the
round
belly
that
bulged
out
beneath
his
skinny
chest
joe
tore
away
more
than
half
of
the
meat
and
made
for
the
door
woodrow
wants
to
meet
with
me
again
this
morning
do
wait
up
for
me
tonight
he
left
the
cottage
and
set
off
toward
the
bill
rolled
over
on
his
bedding
and
said
i
do
like
this
at
all
george
kept
quiet
bill
voice
surprised
him
but
it
should
have
bill
was
clever
enough
to
lie
still
and
feign
sleep
so
that
he
could
overhear
conversations
where
george
would
have
just
sat
up
and
started
talking
orville
should
know
about
this
but
i
ca
tell
if
it
would
make
him
angry
if
it
made
him
angry
and
he
punished
joe
it
would
be
our
fault
for
telling
him
then
we
wo
tell
him
george
said
bill
held
up
his
hand
but
if
we
do
tell
him
and
he
finds
out
on
his
own
he
may
be
angry
with
us
then
we
should
tell
him
george
said
but
joe
and
this
woodrow
may
not
get
along
after
all
and
if
that
happens
the
whole
thing
will
end
on
its
own
then
we
wo
tell
him
george
said
but
if
they
do
get
along
then
they
may
do
something
that
would
make
orville
angry
bill
looked
expectantly
at
george
then
we
should
tell
him
george
said
uncertainly
i
do
know
bill
said
i
have
decided
george
knew
that
this
meant
that
bill
would
have
to
think
on
it
and
so
he
left
him
he
had
to
catch
the
tram
to
make
it
to
his
shift
anyway
the
soft
one
with
the
shift
left
as
soon
as
george
arrived
without
a
word
george
was
used
to
soft
ones
not
having
anything
to
say
to
him
and
preferred
it
that
way
he
was
better
off
than
bill
soft
ones
always
wanted
to
talk
to
bill
and
he
hated
it
since
they
never
had
anything
to
say
that
bill
wanted
to
know
the
weather
needed
no
discussion
bill
said
and
as
for
the
complaints
about
the
shift
lead
well
one
soft
one
was
just
about
the
same
as
any
other
and
orville
had
told
them
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
worked
for
him
not
for
any
lead
joe
liked
talking
to
the
soft
ones
joe
liked
to
talk
period
he
told
the
soft
ones
lies
about
their
childhood
in
the
shack
with
their
father
and
told
them
about
how
his
brothers
tormented
and
even
talked
about
the
weather
when
he
got
back
home
he
told
his
brothers
all
over
again
everything
he
told
the
soft
ones
george
had
memorised
the
sop
manual
when
they
came
to
the
island
five
years
before
it
clearly
said
that
the
floor
of
the
booth
would
be
disinfected
every
three
hours
and
the
surfaces
polished
clean
and
the
pots
and
machines
refilled
the
soft
one
with
the
shift
never
did
any
of
these
things
which
could
get
him
disciplined
by
their
lead
but
george
did
complain
he
just
wiped
and
disinfected
and
when
he
arrived
even
though
he
had
to
be
extra
careful
with
the
water
so
that
he
did
wash
any
of
himself
away
boys
ran
up
and
down
the
midway
baking
in
the
sun
they
reminded
george
of
the
boys
he
gone
to
school
with
after
the
social
worker
had
come
to
his
father
shack
they
teased
him
to
begin
with
but
he
just
stood
with
his
hands
at
his
sides
until
they
stopped
every
time
he
started
a
new
grade
or
a
new
kid
came
to
the
school
it
was
the
same
they
tease
him
or
hit
him
or
throw
things
at
him
and
he
stand
strong
and
silent
until
they
stopped
even
if
it
took
months
his
teachers
quickly
learned
that
calling
on
him
in
class
meant
standing
in
awkward
silence
while
he
sat
stoic
and
waited
for
them
to
call
on
someone
else
the
social
worker
could
make
him
go
to
school
with
the
soft
ones
but
she
could
make
him
act
like
one
george
watched
the
boys
carefully
as
carefully
as
he
had
when
he
stood
silently
in
the
schoolyard
not
seeming
to
watch
anything
he
was
better
at
spotting
a
donkey
than
any
of
the
soft
ones
when
a
boy
was
ready
to
turn
george
could
almost
see
the
shape
of
the
donkey
superimposed
on
the
boy
and
he
radioed
a
keeper
to
pick
up
the
donkey
come
morning
he
got
a
bonus
for
each
one
he
spotted
and
according
to
bill
it
had
accumulated
to
a
sizable
george
looked
at
the
inventory
and
decided
that
the
fudge
was
getting
a
little
long
in
the
tooth
he
start
pushing
dips
and
by
the
end
of
his
shift
the
tub
would
be
empty
and
he
be
able
to
give
it
a
thorough
cleaning
and
a
refill
from
fresh
stock
hey
guys
he
called
to
three
boys
is
anybody
he
dipped
a
floss
and
held
it
up
so
that
it
oozed
fudge
down
his
wrist
the
boys
shyly
approached
his
booth
george
knew
from
their
manner
that
they
were
new
to
the
island
probably
just
picked
up
from
a
or
lasertag
tent
on
the
mainland
that
afternoon
they
did
know
what
to
make
of
their
surroundings
that
was
clear
step
right
up
he
said
i
do
bite
he
smiled
a
smile
he
practiced
in
the
mirror
one
that
shaped
his
soft
flexible
features
into
a
expression
of
idiotic
fun
cautiously
the
boys
came
forward
they
were
the
target
age
and
they
already
accumulated
some
merch
baseball
hats
and
fanny
packs
made
from
neoprene
in
colours
emblazoned
with
the
island
logomarks
and
character
trademarks
they
had
the
beginnings
of
dark
circles
under
their
eyes
and
they
dragged
a
little
with
low
george
dipped
two
more
and
distributed
them
around
the
eldest
a
towheaded
kid
near
the
upper
age
range
said
mister
we
have
got
any
money
what
do
these
cost
george
laughed
like
a
freight
train
it
all
free
sonny
free
as
air
courtesy
of
the
management
as
a
reward
for
very
customers
like
you
this
was
scripted
but
the
trick
was
to
sell
the
line
like
it
was
fresh
the
boys
took
the
cones
from
him
timidly
but
ate
ravenously
george
gave
them
some
logoed
serviettes
to
wipe
up
with
and
ground
the
fudge
into
his
wrists
and
forearms
with
one
of
his
own
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
consulted
the
laminated
timetable
taped
to
the
counter
which
meant
that
the
bulk
of
the
guests
would
be
migrating
towards
actionland
and
the
dinosaur
rides
and
it
was
time
to
push
the
slightly
freakzone
to
balance
the
crowds
you
boys
like
rollercoasters
he
said
the
youngest
they
were
similar
enough
in
appearance
and
distant
enough
in
ages
to
be
brothers
spoke
up
yeah
the
middle
elbowed
him
and
the
youngest
flipped
the
middle
the
bird
well
if
you
follow
the
midway
around
this
curve
to
the
right
and
go
through
the
big
you
be
in
the
freakzone
we
got
a
coaster
called
that
loops
fifty
times
in
five
minutes
running
over
miles
per
if
you
hurry
you
can
beat
the
line
he
looked
the
youngest
in
the
eye
at
the
start
of
the
speech
then
switched
to
the
middle
when
he
talked
about
the
line
the
youngest
started
vibrating
with
excitement
and
the
middle
looked
pensive
and
then
to
the
eldest
said
sounds
good
huh
tom
the
eldest
said
we
have
even
found
out
where
we
sleeping
yet
maybe
we
can
do
the
ride
afterwards
george
winked
at
the
youngest
then
said
do
worry
about
it
kids
i
get
that
sorted
out
for
you
right
now
he
picked
up
the
white
house
phone
and
asked
the
operator
to
connect
him
with
guest
services
hi
there
this
is
george
on
the
midway
i

he
covered
the
mouthpiece
and
said
to
the
boys

sportaseum

catcher
mitts

the
youngest
said

have
it
for
dinner
the
eldest
said
looking
off
at
the
skyline
of
in
the
distance
let
go
on
some
rides
first
george
beamed
his
idiot
grin
at
them
as
they
left
then
his
face
went
slack
and
he
went
back
to
wiping
down
the
surfaces
a
moment
later
a
hand
reached
across
the
counter
and
plucked
the
cloth
from
his
grip
he
looked
up
startled
into
joe
grinning
face
unlike
his
brothers
joe
face
was
all
sharp
angles
and
small
teeth
nobody
knew
what
a
child
of
a
tongue
was
supposed
to
look
like
but
george
had
always
suspected
that
joe
was
right
even
for
a
third
son
big
guy
joe
shouted
workin
hard
george
said
yes
he
stood
patiently
waiting
for
joe
to
give
him
the
cloth
back
joe
held
it
over
his
head
like
a
standard
dancing
back
out
of
reach
even
though
george
had
made
a
grab
for
it
george
waited
joe
walked
back
to
his
counter
and
gave
it
back
we
dozing
the
freakzone
joe
said
in
a
conspiratorial
whisper
he
put
a
spin
on
making
sure
that
george
knew
he
was
including
himself
with
the
island
management
really
george
said
neutrally
yeah
we
gon
na
flatten
that
sucker
start
fresh
and
build
us
a
new
theme
land
i
a
strategic
project
consultant
by
the
time
it
over
i
be
an
imagineer
george
knew
that
the
lands
on
pleasure
island
were
flattened
and
rebuilt
on
a
regular
basis
as
management
worked
to
stay
ahead
of
the
lightspeed
of
the
mainland
still
he
said
well
joe
that
marvelous
i
sure
you
do
a
fabulous
job
joe
sneered
at
him
oh
i
know
i
will
we
all
do
just
jobs
brother
just
some
of
us
fabulous
jobs
to
do
george
refused
to
rise
to
the
bait
he
could
always
outwait
joe
joe
said
we
thinking
of
giving
it
a
monster
theme
monsters
are
testing
very
high
with
this
year
dragons
ogres
cyborgs
you
know
we
may
even
do
a
there
has
been
one
of
those
here
since
the
sixties
george
did
know
what
joe
wanted
him
to
say
he
said
that
sounds
very
nice
joe
gave
him
a
pitying
look
and
then
his
chest
started
ringing
he
extracted
a
slim
phone
from
his
and
turned
away
a
moment
later
he
turned
back
got
ta
go
he
said
meeting
with
woodrow
and
orville
down
at
ops
went
off
in
george
head
should
bill
go
along
if
meeting
with
orville
joe
sneered
at
him
then
took
off
at
a
fast
clip
down
the
midway
george
watched
him
until
he
disappeared
through
one
of
the
access
doors
bill
was
clearly
upset
about
it
george
could
help
but
feel
responsible
he
should
have
called
bill
as
soon
as
joe
told
him
he
was
meeting
with
orville
but
he
waited
until
he
got
home
he
been
home
for
hours
and
joe
still
was
back
bill
picked
absently
at
the
dinner
he
made
and
fretted
he
did
say
how
orville
found
out
bill
asked
george
shook
his
head
mutely
why
did
he
invite
me
bill
asked
i
always
handle
negotiations
for
us
george
could
eat
the
more
bill
fretted
the
more
he
could
eat
it
was
long
dark
outside
hours
and
hours
after
joe
should
been
home
bill
fretted
george
stared
out
the
window
and
joe
did
come
home
then
an
electric
cart
headlights
swept
up
the
trail
to
their
cabin
the
lights
dazzled
george
so
he
could
see
who
was
driving
bill
joined
him
at
the
window
and
squinted
it
joe
and
orville
he
said
george
squinted
too
but
could
make
anything
out
he
took
bill
word
for
it
and
joined
him
outside
it
was
indeed
orville
and
joe
orville
was
driving
and
joe
was
lolling
drunkenly
beside
him
orville
shook
hands
with
bill
and
nodded
to
george
who
lifted
joe
out
of
the
cart
and
carried
him
inside
when
he
got
back
orville
and
bill
were
staring
calmly
into
each
other
eyes
each
waiting
for
the
other
to
say
something
orville
was
dressed
in
his
working
clothes
a
natty
white
suit
with
a
underneath
his
bald
head
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
his
fleshy
unreadable
face
was
ruddy
in
the
glow
from
the
cabin
door
george
bit
his
tongue
to
keep
from
speaking
he
drunk
orville
said
at
last
orville
did
beat
around
the
bush
i
can
see
that
bill
said
did
you
get
him
drunk
yes
i
did
we
were
celebrating
bill
eyes
narrowed
so
you
know
orville
smiled
of
course
i
know
i
set
it
up
i
thought
you
approve
joe
clearly
needed
something
to
keep
him
out
of
trouble
bill
said
this
will
keep
him
out
of
trouble
orville
leaned
against
the
cart
bumper
pulled
out
a
pipe
stuffed
it
and
lit
it
he
puffed
at
it
and
watched
the
smoke
wisp
away
in
the
swamp
breezes
i
think
that
joe
going
to
really
like
life
with
the
imagineers
management
precious
darlings
who
can
do
no
wrong
anything
they
ask
for
they
get
there
wo
be
any
more
discipline
problems
bill
said
why
not
orville
grinned
without
showing
his
teeth
where
there
no
discipline
there
no
discipline
problems
he
can
work
whatever
hours
he
wants
he
have
access
to
anything
he
needs
budget
staff
an
office
whatever
it
his
dream
job
bill
said
i
do
like
this
george
wondered
why
not
it
sounded
pretty
good
to
him
orville
puffed
at
his
pipe
like
it
or
not
i
think
you
have
a
hard
time
convincing
joe
not
to
do
it
he
sold
bill
went
back
into
the
cabin
and
closed
the
door
he
took
that
well
do
you
think
orville
asked
george
said
i
suppose
so
orville
said
is
everything
working
out
all
right
for
you
shifts
ok
george
said
everything
fine
thank
you
orville
tapped
his
pipe
out
on
the
bumper
then
got
back
into
the
cart
all
right
then
good
night
george
george
started
cooking
dinner
for
two
more
and
more
joe
spent
the
night
in
a
suite
at
one
of
the
hotels
working
late
george
did
know
what
sort
of
work
he
was
doing
but
he
sure
seemed
to
enjoy
it
he
hardly
came
back
to
the
cabin
at
all
the
first
time
he
stayed
out
all
night
bill
had
gone
back
to
the
island
and
gotten
orville
out
of
bed
to
help
him
search
after
that
joe
started
sending
out
a
runner
usually
some
poor
ops
trainee
to
tell
them
he
coming
back
for
dinner
eventually
he
stopped
bothering
and
bill
stopped
worrying
one
night
a
month
after
orville
had
come
out
to
the
cabin
george
slathered
a
muskrat
carcass
with
mayonnaise
and
lemon
and
dragonfly
eggs
and
set
it
out
for
him
and
joe
bill
hardly
ate
which
was
usually
a
signal
that
he
was
thinking
george
left
him
half
of
the
dinner
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
bill
picked
his
way
through
the
rest
then
pushed
his
plate
away
george
cleared
it
and
brought
them
both
mason
jars
full
of
muddy
water
from
the
swamp
out
back
bill
took
his
jar
out
front
of
the
cabin
and
leaned
against
the
wall
and
stared
out
into
the
night
sipping
george
joined
him
we
getting
old
bill
said
at
last
every
night
the
inside
of
my
uniform
is
black
george
said
mine
too
we
getting
very
old
i
think
that
you
at
least
thirty
and
pretty
sure
that
i
that
old
our
father
told
me
that
he
thought
he
was
fifty
the
year
he
died
and
he
was
very
old
for
one
of
us
george
thought
of
their
father
on
his
deathbed
eating
the
food
they
chewed
for
him
eyes
nearly
blind
skin
crazed
with
cracks
he
was
very
old
george
said
bill
held
his
two
whole
hands
up
against
the
stars
when
father
was
my
age
he
had
two
sons
can
you
remember
how
proud
he
was
of
us
how
proud
he
was
of
himself
he
done
well
enough
that
he
could
lose
both
his
thumbs
and
still
know
that
his
sons
would
take
care
of
him
george
shifted
and
sighed
he
been
thinking
about
sons
too
i
wanted
a
son
since
we
came
to
the
island
bill
said
i
never
did
anything
about
it
because
i
could
take
care
of
joe
and
a
son
bill
turned
to
look
at
george
i
think
joe
finally
taking
care
of
himself
george
did
know
what
to
say
if
bill
had
a
son
then
he
could
they
could
both
stop
working
to
raise
their
sons
but
bill
always
made
the
decisions
for
them
george
did
know
what
to
say
so
he
said
nothing
i
going
to
have
a
son
bill
said
bill
did
it
the
next
night
he
told
orville
that
he
need
a
month
off
and
after
eating
the
dinner
george
made
for
them
he
made
a
nest
of
earth
and
blankets
on
the
floor
of
their
cabin
george
sat
in
the
corner
and
watched
bill
as
he
stared
at
his
thumbs
it
was
the
most
important
decision
one
of
their
kind
ever
made
a
clever
son
of
the
left
hand
or
a
strong
son
of
the
right
george
knew
that
his
son
would
come
from
the
left
hand
in
the
world
his
father
had
put
them
into
cleverness
was
far
more
important
than
strength
after
all
bill
was
having
the
first
son
bill
put
his
clever
left
thumb
in
his
mouth
and
slowly
slowly
bit
down
george
felt
muddy
tears
pricking
at
his
eyes
bill
hand
coursed
with
silty
blood
he
ignored
it
and
used
his
strong
right
hand
to
take
the
severed
thumb
from
his
mouth
and
bed
it
down
with
infinite
care
in
the
nest
he
built
george
cautiously
moved
forward
to
peer
at
the
thumb
which
was
already
moving
blindly
in
its
nest
twisting
like
a
grub
bill
looked
on
his
eyes
shining
it
perfect
george
breathed
george
felt
an
uncharacteristic
welling
up
inside
him
and
he
put
his
arm
around
bill
shoulders
bill
leaned
into
him
and
said
thank
you
george
this
family
would
exist
without
you
they
both
slept
curled
around
the
nest
that
night
by
morning
the
thumb
had
sprouted
tiny
and
and
it
inched
itself
blindly
around
the
nest
george
marveled
at
it
before
going
to
work
joe
stopped
by
his
stand
that
day
his
belly
was
bigger
than
ever
and
his
skin
was
cracking
like
their
father
had
big
guy
he
shouted
vaulting
the
counter
into
george
stand
where
bill
today
he
was
at
his
post
george
said
bill
had
a
son
last
night
from
his
left
hand
joe
rolled
his
eyes
which
had
gone
the
murky
yellow
of
swamp
water
wonderful
right
ugh
there
are
better
ways
to
achieve
immortality
bro
i
designing
a
for
horrorzone
you
an
earthworm
crawling
underneath
a
graveyard
it
gon
na
be
huge
maggots
as
big
as
horses
chasing
the
guests
through
the
tunnels
huge
ghost
hands
grabbing
at
them
we
building
a
giant
tombstone
as
the
weenie
you
be
able
to
see
it
from
anywhere
on
the
island
we
build
out
over
the
midway
for
horrorzone
it
the
biggest
rehab
done
since
they
brought
in
electric
power
as
usual
george
did
know
what
to
say
to
joe
that
sounds
very
nice
he
said
joe
rolled
his
eyes
again
and
started
to
say
something
but
stopped
when
three
guests
came
up
to
george
booth
george
hardly
recognised
the
mitchell
brothers
the
youngest
was
already
donkey
so
dangerously
close
that
it
was
a
miracle
he
had
been
picked
up
already
he
was
hunched
over
and
his
hands
were
fused
into
fists
his
hair
had
grown
down
over
his
shoulders
in
a
coarse
mane
and
his
lips
bulged
around
his
elongated
jaws
the
middle
and
eldest
were
well
on
their
ways
too
the
points
of
their
ears
poked
out
from
under
their
hair
and
they
carried
themselves
painfully
forcing
their
legs
and
hips
upright
george
flipped
over
his
phone
and
punched
but
left
it
out
of
sight
below
the
counter
loudly
he
said
come
on
over
boys
you
look
like
you
could
use
one
of
george
the
best
on
the
midway
from
the
phone
he
heard
the
security
operator
say
thank
you
george
we
be
along
in
a
moment
surreptitiously
he
racked
the
receiver
and
smiled
at
the
boys
how
are
you
enjoying
your
stay
boys
he
said
the
youngest
said
around
his
clumsy
teeth
george
handed
him
a
cone
piled
high
with
floss
then
started
building
two
more
for
his
brothers
joe
smirked
at
them
george
hoped
he
would
say
anything
before
security
got
there
the
eldest
said
i
do
think
my
brother
feeling
too
good
is
there
a
doctor
here
i
can
take
him
to
the
youngest
face
sticky
with
confection
kicked
his
brother
i
fine
he
said
i
wan
na
go
on
more
rideth
his
brother
said
we
go
on
more
rides
after
we
see
a
doctor
the
youngest
dropped
to
his
knees
and
cried
no
he
said
hammering
his
fists
on
the
ground
no
no
no
no
george
watched
in
alarm
as
the
boy
went
all
the
way
over
to
donkey
his
cries
turned
to
brays
and
his
shorts
split
around
his
haunches
and
tail
his
shirt
went
next
and
george
smoothly
vaulted
the
counter
and
stood
in
front
of
the
donkey
blocking
him
from
the
other
two
made
a
run
for
it
george
snagged
the
middle
by
his
collar
but
the
boy
tore
free
and
took
off
down
the
midway
george
looked
about
wildly
for
security
but
they
still
had
arrived
then
joe
tore
past
him
moving
faster
than
george
had
ever
seen
him
go
he
caught
the
boys
and
stuffed
one
under
each
arm
kicking
and
squirming
he
grinned
ferociously
as
he
pinned
them
beneath
his
knees
at
george
feet
he
clamped
his
hands
over
their
mouths
got
he
said
to
george
a
security
team
emerged
from
the
utilidor
beside
george
booth
wearing
clown
makeup
and
baggy
pants
two
of
them
tranquilised
the
boys
and
the
third
fitted
the
donkey
out
with
a
halter
and
bit
the
clown
slapped
the
donkey
haunch
appreciatively
he
a
healthy
one
the
security
team
disappeared
down
the
utilidor
with
the
mitchell
brothers
two
boys
and
a
donkey
joe
smacked
george
on
the
back
did
you
see
me
catch
them
like
greased
lightning
bounty
here
i
come
george
did
mind
sharing
his
bounty
with
joe
so
he
just
smiled
and
nodded
and
went
back
around
to
his
booth
bill
named
his
son
tom
names
were
very
important
to
their
people
but
the
soft
ones
world
demanded
them
within
a
week
tom
was
eagerly
toddling
through
their
cabin
tasting
everything
exploring
everything
his
eyes
shone
with
curious
brilliance
the
clever
son
of
a
clever
son
george
loved
bill
son
he
loved
to
watch
tom
as
he
gnawed
at
their
bedding
as
he
dug
at
the
floor
in
search
of
grubs
tom
was
clearly
delighted
with
his
surroundings
and
george
basked
in
tom
delight
bill
could
barely
restrain
himself
from
picking
tom
up
and
hugging
him
every
moment
the
only
time
he
left
george
alone
with
tom
was
a
few
precious
moments
after
each
evening
meal
when
he
would
duck
into
the
woods
to
find
some
new
toy
for
tom
a
crippled
chipmunk
a
handful
of
pretty
rocks
a
discarded
beer
can
the
son
built
bizarre
towers
out
of
them
then
knocked
them
down
in
a
fit
of
giggles
tom
ate
all
day
long
and
spoke
a
steady
stream
of
adorable
nonsense
bill
hardly
spoke
to
george
their
evening
meals
were
given
over
to
watching
the
son
eat
george
did
mind
talking
to
the
guests
all
day
wore
him
out
when
tom
was
two
months
old
joe
came
by
george
booth
well
it
final
tomorrow
we
shut
down
the
midway
too
only
stood
this
long
because
some
of
the
older
imagineers
had
an
emotional
attachment
to
it
i
told
demographic
not
the
demographic
so
we
knocking
it
down
horrorzone
gon
na
be
he
skipped
off
before
george
could
say
anything
his
ears
were
long
and
pointed
it
was
the
first
time
george
noticed
it
but
now
he
could
see
that
gait
was
just
because
of
his
belly
george
built
a
dozen
cones
for
the
guests
but
his
heart
was
in
it
besides
most
of
the
guests
already
had
their
hands
full
of
gummi
spiders
and
snakes
from
the
actionland
jungle
treats
buffet
his
thoughts
were
full
of
joe
and
he
turned
them
over
in
his
slow
cautious
manner
joe
was
turning
into
a
donkey
he
did
think
that
one
of
their
kind
could
turn
into
a
donkey
but
this
was
pleasure
island
indulging
your
vices
was
a
dangerous
pastime
here
he
should
tell
bill
but
there
was
no
phone
at
the
cabin
he
could
send
a
runner
for
him
because
this
was
family
business
his
shift
would
end
for
hours
yet
and
this
was
too
important
to
wait
finally
he
called
his
lead
i
have
to
get
offstage
i
having
a
bad
day
technically
this
was
allowed
management
did
want
anyone
onstage
who
percent
but
it
was
something
that
none
of
the
brothers
not
even
joe
had
ever
done
the
lead
was
surprised
but
he
sent
over
a
soft
one
to
relieve
george
orville
and
bill
were
sitting
out
front
of
the
cabin
watching
tom
when
george
got
back
he
wrung
his
hands
as
he
approached
them
not
sure
of
what
to
say
and
whether
he
should
talk
in
front
of
orville
at
all
he
held
his
left
thumb
in
his
right
hand
and
it
comforted
him
a
little
bill
and
orville
were
so
engrossed
in
tom
antics
that
they
did
even
notice
george
until
he
cleared
his
throat
orville
raised
his
eyebrows
and
looked
significantly
at
bill
i
just
saw
joe
george
said
on
the
midway
his
ears
are
pointed
and
walking
all
hunched
over
i
give
him
a
few
days
at
the
most
before
he
all
the
way
gone
george
held
his
breath
waiting
for
bill
reaction
too
bad
bill
said
it
was
inevitable
i
suppose
a
child
of
the
tongue
what
was
father
thinking
orville
smiled
and
puffed
at
his
pipe
do
you
worry
about
it
george
going
to
be
much
much
happier
focussed
if
you
like
i
can
bring
him
out
here
to
live
little
tom
could
have
pony
rides
bill
said
i
do
think
that
such
a
good
idea
joe
too
wild
to
play
with
a
child
orville
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
be
amazed
at
how
docile
become
bill
scooped
up
tom
who
was
up
to
his
waist
now
and
who
liked
to
grab
onto
bill
nose
we
see
then
he
retreated
into
the
cabin
with
his
son
orville
turned
to
george
and
said
you
probably
heard
that
we
taking
down
the
midway
tomorrow
the
others
are
all
being
reassigned
until
the
rehab
is
done
but
i
thought
i
see
if
i
could
get
you
a
couple
months
off
you
could
stay
here
and
play
with
tom
it
not
every
day
you
get
to
be
a
new
uncle
orville
had
always
taken
obvious
pleasure
in
the
transformation
of
boys
into
donkeys
it
was
the
whole
why
of
pleasure
island
after
all
orville
seemed
especially
pleased
tonight
and
george
thought
that
he
was
as
surprised
about
bill
as
george
was
george
not
knowing
what
to
say
to
any
of
it
said
nothing
it
did
take
long
for
george
to
start
missing
the
midway
stuck
at
the
cabin
with
bill
and
tom
he
sat
against
an
outside
wall
and
tried
not
to
get
in
the
way
he
prepared
meals
in
silence
taking
a
long
time
in
the
woods
gathering
up
choice
morsels
bill
and
tom
ate
on
the
floor
away
from
the
table
bill
chewed
the
tougher
morsels
first
and
then
put
them
in
tom
mouth
with
his
crippled
left
hand
most
of
the
time
neither
of
them
took
any
notice
of
george
one
day
he
prepared
a
whole
day
worth
of
meals
and
left
them
on
the
table
then
walked
to
the
utilidor
at
the
other
side
of
the
woods
he
boarded
a
tram
and
rode
to
the
old
midway
entrance
the
midway
was
fenced
in
with
tall
plywood
sheets
and
construction
crews
bustled
over
the
naked
skeletons
of
the
new
horrorzone
heavy
machinery
groaned
and
crashed
nothing
but
the
distant
silhouettes
of
actionland
skyline
were
familiar
george
tried
to
imagine
working
here
for
years
to
come
an
overwhelming
tiredness
weighed
him
down
he
took
the
tram
back
to
the
cabin
and
stripped
off
his
clothes
they
were
browner
than
ever
his
arms
felt
weak
and
tired
he
suddenly
knew
that
he
would
never
have
a
son
of
his
own
bill
and
tom
were
playing
out
front
of
the
cabin
he
sat
in
his
usual
spot
against
the
wall
and
watched
them
bill
he
said
softly
yes
bill
said
when
will
i
have
a
son
of
my
own
bill
always
knew
the
answers
bill
gathered
tom
up
to
his
chest
unconsciously
while
he
thought
i
suppose
that
once
tom
is
grown
you
could
take
some
time
off
and
have
a
son
of
your
own
to
his
own
surprise
george
said
i
want
to
have
a
son
now
bill
said
that
out
of
the
question
george
we
too
busy
with
tom
on
hearing
bill
annoyed
tone
tom
leaned
into
him
george
said
i
not
busy
i
am
old
though
if
i
do
have
a
son
soon
i
wo
be
able
to
care
for
it
until
it
old
enough
to
care
for
me
bill
said
you
thinking
like
father
we
living
with
the
soft
ones
now
orville
will
make
sure
that
you
and
your
son
will
be
fine
until
he
grown
george
never
won
arguments
with
bill
he
went
inside
the
cabin
and
set
out
dinner
orville
visited
the
brothers
the
next
morning
he
chucked
tom
under
the
chin
and
shook
hands
with
bill
then
he
took
george
out
into
the
woods
for
a
walk
your
brother
tells
me
you
want
a
son
of
your
own
he
said
george
nodded
and
stooped
to
put
a
small
mossy
log
in
his
basket
bill
does
want
you
to
huh
george
did
feel
very
comfortable
discussing
the
family
with
orville
that
was
bill
job
after
some
thought
he
said
not
right
now
orville
said
i
can
see
that
that
makes
you
unhappy
no
one
should
be
unhappy
here
i
see
what
i
can
do
come
down
to
ops
tomorrow
morning
we
talk
more
when
george
got
back
to
the
cabin
bill
was
lying
on
his
back
on
the
floor
laughing
while
tom
climbed
all
over
him
tom
still
babbled
but
they
were
real
words
now
though
nonsensical
with
his
constant
talking
he
reminded
george
of
joe
and
that
made
him
even
sadder
george
had
never
been
to
ops
before
but
he
knew
where
it
was
in
a
collection
of
prefab
buildings
hidden
behind
the
topiary
sculptures
near
magicland
he
clutched
his
right
thumb
nervously
as
he
stood
and
waited
in
the
reception
area
for
orville
to
come
and
get
him
the
secretary
had
taken
his
name
and
buzzed
orville
and
now
kept
sneaking
him
horrified
looks
george
family
were
the
only
of
their
kind
to
leave
their
homeland
and
join
the
soft
ones
and
here
at
ops
there
were
any
number
of
babus
who
never
heard
tell
of
them
orville
was
all
smiles
and
effusion
as
he
breezed
through
the
glass
and
pounded
george
on
the
back
george
i
so
you
came
down
he
took
george
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
stopping
to
wink
at
the
secretary
who
looked
at
him
with
a
mixture
of
disgust
and
admiration
orville
office
was
buried
in
a
twisting
maze
of
corridors
where
busy
soft
ones
talked
on
telephones
and
clattered
on
keyboards
he
led
george
through
his
door
into
an
office
as
big
as
george
cabin
orville
paced
and
talked
did
i
say
i
was
glad
you
came
i
glad
you
came
now
let
talk
about
bill
bill
happy
he
got
what
he
wants
a
son
he
does
have
to
take
care
of
joe
it
good
for
him
he
paused
and
looked
at
george
george
nodded
ok
there
a
problem
though
you
want
a
son
too
only
bill
wo
allow
it
it
did
need
any
comment
so
george
kept
quiet
my
thinking
is
bill
so
busy
with
tom
he
would
really
notice
if
you
were
there
or
not
you
an
adult
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
do
you
see
where
i
going
with
this
george
assumed
it
was
a
rhetorical
question
right
what
i
thinking
is
there
no
reason
that
both
of
you
should
have
your
own
son
this
is
pleasure
island
after
all
no
one
should
be
sad
on
pleasure
island
you
worked
hard
and
well
for
us
for
a
long
time
here
we
can
take
care
of
you
george
felt
an
uncomfortable
sensation
in
his
stomach
a
knot
of
guilt
like
rising
vomit
i
thought
about
having
another
cabin
built
in
the
woods
but
that
no
good
i
think
that
you
and
bill
need
your
own
space
so
let
me
bounce
my
current
thought
off
you
we
put
you
up
in
the
new
monster
arms
that
the
hotel
building
for
horrorzone
it
way
ahead
of
schedule
almost
finished
now
there
a
penthouse
suite
that
you
can
take
for
as
long
as
you
like
it
only
temporary
just
until
you
and
bill
have
had
some
time
to
raise
up
your
sons
then
we
get
the
whole
family
together
back
at
the
cabin
the
guilt
rose
higher
choking
george
do
worry
about
eating
either
i
briefed
the
house
chef
on
your
tastes
and
he
send
up
three
squares
every
day
everything
a
growing
boy
needs
he
flashed
a
grin
and
forget
about
bill
i
smooth
things
over
with
him
he
see
that
for
the
best
finally
george
had
something
to
say
what
about
joe
orville
had
been
almost
dancing
as
he
spoke
enchanted
with
his
own
words
he
pulled
up
short
when
george
spoke
what
about
him
i
want
to
live
with
him
again
george
said
he
gone
you
know
that
orville
pointed
his
fingers
alongside
his
ears
the
monthly
ferry
will
take
him
to
the
mainland
tomorrow
i
do
care
about
that
george
said
i
want
him
there
orville
said
i
do
think
that
such
a
good
idea
george
you
going
away
to
concentrate
on
joe
a
handful
even
now
i
do
want
you
distracted
george
said
i
want
joe
orville
stared
at
him
george
set
his
face
into
a
blank
mask
finally
orville
said
if
that
what
you
want
that
what
you
get
george
did
have
anything
to
fetch
from
the
cabin
and
orville
thought
it
would
be
best
if
he
spoke
to
bill
alone
so
he
sent
george
to
the
stables
to
get
joe
the
donkey
stables
were
beyond
ops
at
the
very
edge
of
the
island
opposite
the
docks
where
the
ferries
brought
new
boys
in
a
different
kind
of
boat
docked
there
large
utility
freighters
that
brought
in
everything
the
island
needed
and
took
away
braying
kicking
herds
of
jackasses
the
donkeys
shifted
nervously
in
their
stalls
george
smelled
and
hay
and
heard
fidgeting
hooves
and
quiet
braying
sobs
he
was
clear
on
what
happened
to
donkeys
when
they
went
back
to
the
mainland
but
he
had
an
idea
that
it
was
very
pleasant
on
the
island
donkeys
were
prizes
a
sign
that
a
every
wish
had
been
gratified
what
happened
afterwards
was
something
that
they
were
encouraged
to
think
about
he
walked
down
the
clean
wooden
aisles
peering
into
the
stalls
looking
for
joe
finally
in
a
dark
stall
in
the
very
darkest
corner
of
the
stables
he
found
him
a
large
jackass
who
leapt
up
and
brayed
loudly
at
him
when
he
clucked
his
tongue
at
it
joe
he
asked
softly
the
donkey
brayed
again
and
kicked
at
the
stall
door
it
was
already
splintered
from
many
such
kicks
george
opened
the
catch
and
was
nearly
trampled
beneath
joe
hooves
as
he
ran
out
and
away
braying
loudly
george
chased
his
brother
he
did
start
very
fast
but
once
he
got
going
inertia
made
him
unstoppable
he
cornered
joe
at
the
door
that
led
out
to
the
island
the
donkey
was
kicking
at
it
trying
for
escape
george
locked
his
strong
right
arm
around
joe
neck
stop
it
joe
he
said
i
taking
you
out
with
me
but
you
have
to
stop
it
joe
eyes
rolled
madly
and
he
struggled
against
george
kicking
and
biting
george
waited
in
silence
until
the
donkey
tired
then
used
a
bridle
hanging
on
the
wall
to
lead
joe
out
of
the
stables
when
joe
saw
orville
waiting
for
them
he
went
wild
again
george
caught
him
by
the
hind
leg
and
dragged
him
to
the
ground
while
orville
danced
back
with
a
strange
grace
orville
grinned
and
said
i
guess
he
does
like
me
very
much
he
came
forward
and
darted
an
affectionate
pat
on
joe
haunch
joe
brayed
loudly
and
george
kept
his
own
counsel
orville
led
them
down
a
utilidor
and
into
an
electric
tram
with
an
open
car
george
led
joe
in
and
held
onto
his
neck
while
orville
sped
down
the
utilidor
he
drove
up
a
service
ramp
and
out
into
horrorzone
then
to
the
doors
of
the
newly
completed
arms
george
and
joe
lived
in
the
monster
arms
every
morning
orville
paid
them
a
visit
and
snuck
looks
at
george
thumbs
they
were
intact
george
wanted
to
have
a
son
but
he
could
bring
himself
to
do
it
visits
grew
shorter
and
orville
manner
grew
more
irritated
still
george
had
no
son
one
day
he
waited
until
joe
was
napping
and
slipped
out
through
the
elevator
right
down
into
the
utilidor
the
tram
driver
recognised
him
and
took
him
out
to
the
cabin
the
last
mile
of
the
utilidor
was
dusty
and
disused
george
leaped
off
the
tram
and
walked
quickly
to
the
cabin
his
heart
racing
it
had
been
so
long
since
he
seen
bill
and
little
tom
he
missed
them
terribly
the
little
cabin
was
even
smaller
than
george
remembered
it
and
it
looked
sad
sagging
and
ramshackle
he
hesitated
at
the
door
then
feeling
a
stranger
knocked
there
was
movement
inside
but
no
voices
and
the
door
stayed
shut
george
opened
the
door
it
was
a
disaster
the
kitchen
cupboards
were
smashed
in
the
little
table
knocked
over
and
splintered
the
bedding
scattered
and
soiled
deep
shadows
collected
in
the
corners
bill
george
called
softly
a
shadow
stirred
an
indistinct
figure
within
its
depths
bill
it
george
i
missed
you
i
need
to
talk
with
you
i
confused
the
shadow
stirred
again
george
crept
forward
peering
his
old
eyes
bill
huddled
in
the
corner
wracked
and
wasted
he
stared
up
at
george
through
eyes
filmed
with
tears
he
held
up
his
hands
they
had
already
begun
to
shape
themselves
into
hooves
but
george
could
still
see
that
both
his
thumbs
were
gone
his
ears
were
pointed
and
long
oh
bill
george
said
his
brother
let
out
a
braying
sob
and
george
saw
he
had
no
tongue
orville
came
looking
for
them
the
next
morning
where
are
the
sons
george
asked
him
while
stroking
the
donkey
head
in
his
lap
orville
smiled
a
slightly
abashed
smile
i
keeping
them
safe
i
did
think
that
bill
was
in
any
shape
to
take
care
of
them
george
said
i
take
care
of
them
bring
them
here
joe
too
he
in
the
room
i
take
care
of
them
all
orville
smiled
his
abashed
smile
again
then
gave
george
an
ironic
salute
yes
sir
he
said
he
patted
bill
haunch
and
smiled
to
himself
george
did
know
how
to
respond
to
irony
so
he
held
his
brother
more
tightly
eventually
orville
went
away
and
then
came
back
a
while
after
that
he
drove
an
electric
cart
in
the
front
seat
three
sons
bounced
tom
bright
and
curious
another
strong
and
big
a
third
whose
little
pot
belly
jiggled
as
he
talked
and
talked
and
talked
in
a
trailer
joe
kicked
and
fought
against
his
bonds
george
let
him
out
first
then
took
the
sons
to
the
porch
joe
and
bill
stared
at
each
other
for
a
long
moment
then
bill
brayed
out
a
long
donkeyish
laugh
orville
looked
with
proprietary
satisfaction
at
the
donkeys
then
at
the
sons
then
at
george
he
waggled
a
finger
at
