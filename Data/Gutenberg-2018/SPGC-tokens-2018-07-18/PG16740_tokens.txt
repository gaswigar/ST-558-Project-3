introduction
susanna
centlivre
in
busie
contributed
to
the
stage
one
of
the
most
successful
comedies
of
intrigue
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
this
play
written
when
there
was
a
decided
trend
in
england
toward
sentimental
drama
shows
centlivre
a
strong
supporter
of
laughing
comedy
she
had
turned
for
a
time
to
sentimental
comedy
and
with
one
of
her
three
sentimental
plays
had
achieved
a
great
success
but
her
true
bent
seems
to
have
been
toward
realistic
comedies
chiefly
of
intrigue
of
her
nineteen
plays
written
from
to
ten
are
realistic
comedies
three
of
these
proved
very
popular
in
her
time
and
enjoyed
a
long
stage
history
busie
wonder
a
woman
keeps
a
and
bold
stroke
for
a
busie
best
illustrates
centlivre
preference
for
laughing
comedy
with
an
improved
moral
tone
the
characters
and
the
plot
are
amusing
but
inoffensive
and
compared
to
those
of
restoration
drama
satisfy
the
desire
of
the
growing
audience
for
respectability
on
the
stage
the
theory
of
comedy
on
which
busie
rests
is
a
traditional
one
but
centlivre
simple
pronouncements
on
the
virtues
of
realistic
over
sentimental
comedy
are
interesting
because
of
the
controversy
on
this
subject
among
critics
and
writers
at
this
time
in
the
preface
to
her
first
play
perjur
she
takes
issue
with
jeremy
collier
on
the
charge
of
immorality
in
realistic
plays
the
stage
she
believes
should
present
characters
as
they
are
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
a
person
whose
inclinations
are
always
forming
projects
to
the
dishonor
of
her
husband
should
deliver
her
commands
to
her
confident
in
the
words
of
a
psalm
in
a
letter
written
in
she
says
i
think
the
main
design
of
comedy
is
to
make
us
laugh
abel
boyer
of
wit
politicks
and
london
but
she
adds
since
collier
has
taught
religion
to
the
rhiming
trade
the
comick
muse
in
tragick
posture
sat
until
she
discovered
farquhar
whose
language
is
amusing
but
decorous
and
whose
plots
are
virtuous
this
insistence
on
decorum
and
virtue
indicates
a
concession
to
collier
and
to
the
public
thus
in
the
preface
to
she
reiterates
her
belief
that
comedy
should
amuse
but
adds
that
she
strove
for
a
modest
stile
which
might
not
disoblige
the
nicest
ear
this
modest
style
not
practiced
in
early
plays
is
achieved
admirably
in
busie
yet
as
she
says
in
the
epilogue
she
has
not
followed
the
critics
who
balk
the
pleasure
of
the
audience
to
refine
their
taste
her
play
will
with
good
humour
pleasure
crown
the
night
in
dialogue
in
plot
and
particularly
in
the
character
of
the
amusing
but
inoffensive
marplot
she
fulfills
her
simple
theory
of
comedy
designed
not
for
reform
but
for
laughter
centlivre
followed
the
practices
of
her
contemporaries
in
borrowing
the
plot
for
busie
the
three
sources
for
the
play
are
devil
is
an
by
jonson
by
molière
and
martin
or
the
feigned
by
dryden
from
devil
is
an
centlivre
borrowed
minor
details
and
two
episodes
one
of
them
the
amusing
dumb
scene
this
scene
though
a
close
imitation
seems
more
amusing
in
busie
than
in
jonson
play
perhaps
because
the
characters
especially
sir
francis
gripe
and
miranda
are
more
credible
and
more
fully
portrayed
from
the
second
source
for
busie
molière
i
believe
centlivre
borrowed
the
framework
for
her
parallel
plots
the
theme
of
marplot
blundering
and
the
name
and
general
character
of
marplot
but
she
has
improved
what
she
borrowed
she
places
in
molière
framework
more
credible
women
characters
than
his
especially
in
the
charming
miranda
and
the
crafty
patch
she
constructs
a
more
skillful
intrigue
plot
for
the
stage
than
his
subplot
and
emphasizes
spanish
customs
in
the
lively
plot
centlivre
concentrates
on
marplot
blundering
whereas
molière
concentrates
on
the
servant
mascarille
schemes
marplot
funniest
blunder
in
the
monkey
scene
is
entirely
original
as
far
as
i
know
iv
iv
but
her
greatest
change
is
in
the
character
of
marplot
who
in
her
hands
becomes
not
so
much
stupid
as
human
and
irresistibly
ludicrous
centlivre
style
is
of
course
inferior
to
that
of
molière
in
the
preface
to
in
speaking
of
borrowings
from
molière
she
said
that
borrowers
must
take
care
to
touch
the
colors
with
an
english
pencil
and
form
the
piece
according
to
our
manners
of
course
her
touching
the
colors
with
an
english
pencil
meant
changing
the
style
of
molière
to
suit
the
less
delicate
taste
of
the
english
audience
a
third
source
for
busie
is
dryden
martin
since
dryden
followed
molière
with
considerable
exactness
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
beyond
doubt
that
centlivre
borrowed
from
molière
rather
than
from
dryden
yet
i
believe
after
a
careful
analysis
of
the
plays
that
she
borrowed
from
molière
she
made
of
busie
a
comedy
of
intrigue
based
on
the
theme
and
plot
used
by
both
molière
and
dryden
but
she
omitted
the
scandalous
restoration
third
plot
which
dryden
had
added
to
molière
her
characters
are
english
in
speech
and
action
but
they
lack
the
coarseness
apparent
in
martin
though
it
is
impossible
to
prove
the
exact
sources
of
centlivre
borrowings
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
has
improved
what
she
borrowed
whatever
the
truth
may
be
about
centlivre
use
of
her
sources
her
play
remained
in
the
repertory
of
acting
plays
long
after
and
martin
had
disappeared
busie
opened
at
the
drury
lane
theater
on
may
steele
who
listed
the
play
in

not
mention
the
length
of
the

thomas
whincop
says
that
the
play
ran
thirteen
nights

but

the
play
had
an
opening
run
of
seven
nights

the
english
stage

eighteenth
and
nineteenth

much
more

busie
seems
to
have
reached
its
greatest
popularity
in
england
in
the
middle
and
late
eighteenth
century
and
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth

william

remarks

of

busie
has
been
acted
a
thousand
times
in

and
country

delight
to
the
old
the
young

the
busie
enjoyed
a
similar
place
of
importance

achieved
its
greatest
popularity
in

your

that
it

accounted
unpardonable
rudeness
to
obtrude

nature

whose
sublime

moderates
that
council

at

critical
juncture

fate

then
i
was
encourag
by
reflecting
that
and
the
two

among
the
both
for
political
and

virtues

then
again

but

ay
if

hundred
gold
will
fetch
i
warrant
thee
boy
but
who
are
they
who
are
they
come
sir
one
is
a
lady
whose
face
i
never
saw
but
witty
as
an
angel
the
other
beautiful
as
and
a
fool
sir
for
ought
i
know
for
i
never
spoke
to
her
but
you
can
inform
me
i
am
charm
by
the
wit
of
one
and
dye
for
the
beauty
of
the
other
and
pray
which
are
you
in
quest
of
now
sir
i
prefer
the
sensual
pleasure
i
for
her
i
seen
who
is
thy
father
ward
nay
then
i
pity
you
for
the
jew
my
father
will
no
more
part
with
her
and
pound
than
he
wou
with
a
guinea
to
keep
me
from
starving
sir
now
you
see
gold
ca
do
every
thing
yes
for
is
her
gold
that
bars
my
father
gate
against
you
sir
why
if
he
is
this
avaricious
wretch
how
thou
by
such
a
liberal
education
not
a
souse
out
of
his
pocket
i
assure
you
i
had
an
uncle
who
defray
that
charge
but
for
some
litte
wildnesses
of
youth
tho
he
made
me
his
heir
left
dad
my
guardian
till
i
came
to
years
of
discretion
which
i
presume
the
old
gentleman
will
never
think
i
am
and
now
he
has
got
the
estate
into
his
clutches
it
does
me
no
more
good
than
if
it
lay
in
dominions
sir
what
thou
find
no
stratagem
to
redeem
it
i
have
made
many
essays
to
no
purpose
tho
want
the
mistress
of
invention
still
tempts
me
on
yet
still
the
old
fox
is
too
cunning
for
me
i
am
upon
my
last
project
which
if
it
fails
then
for
my
last
refuge
a
brown
musquet
sir
what
can
i
assist
thee
not
yet
when
you
can
i
have
confidence
enough
in
you
to
ask
it
sir
i
am
always
ready
but
what
do
he
intend
to
do
with
is
she
to
be
sold
in
private
or
will
he
put
her
up
by
way
of
auction
at
who
bids
most
if
so
egad
i
for
him
my
gold
as
you
say
shall
be
subservient
to
my
pleasure
to
deal
ingeniously
with
you
sir
i
know
very
little
of
her
or
home
for
since
my
uncle
death
and
my
return
from
travel
i
have
never
been
well
with
my
father
he
thinks
my
expences
too
great
and
i
his
allowance
too
little
he
never
sees
me
but
he
quarrels
and
to
avoid
that
i
shun
his
house
as
much
as
possible
the
report
is
he
intends
to
marry
her
himself
sir
can
she
consent
to
it
yes
faith
so
they
say
but
i
tell
you
i
am
wholly
ignorant
of
the
matter
and
i
are
like
two
violent
members
of
a
contrary
party
i
can
scarce
allow
her
beauty
tho
all
the
world
do
nor
she
me
civility
for
that
contempt
i
fancy
she
plays
the
already
and
sets
the
old
gentleman
on
to
do
mischief
sir
then
i
your
free
consent
to
get
her
ay
and
my
if
occasion
be
sir
pugh
yonder
a
fool
coming
this
way
let
avoid
him
what
no
no
he
my
instrument
there
a
thousand
conveniences
in
him
he
lend
me
his
money
when
he
has
any
run
of
my
errands
and
be
proud
o
in
short
he
pimp
for
me
lye
for
me
drink
for
me
do
any
thing
but
fight
for
me
and
that
i
trust
to
my
own
arm
for
sir
nay
then
he
to
be
endur
i
never
knew
his
qualifications
before
with
a
patch
cross
his
dear
your
ha
sir
the
man
in
the
world
i
have
an
ambition
to
be
known
to
give
me
thy
hand
dear
boy
a
good
assurance
but
heark
ye
how
came
your
beautiful
countenance
clouded
in
the
wrong
place
i
must
confess
is
a
little
but
no
matter
for
that
a
word
with
you
prithee
introduce
me
to
sir
he
is
a
man
of
wit
and
i
give
ten
guinea
to
when
you
have
you
mean
ay
when
i
have
pugh
pox
you
cut
the
thread
of
my
discourse
i
wou
give
ten
guinea
i
say
to
be
rank
in
his
acquaintance
well
is
a
vast
addition
to
a
man
fortune
according
to
the
rout
of
the
world
to
be
seen
in
the
company
of
leading
men
for
then
we
are
all
thought
to
be
politicians
or
whigs
or
jacks
or
or
or
levellers
and
so
forth
for
you
must
know
we
all
herd
in
parties
now
then
a
fool
for
diversion
is
out
of
fashion
i
find
yes
without
it
be
a
mimicking
fool
and
they
are
darlings
every
where
but
prithee
introduce
me
well
on
condition
you
give
us
a
true
account
how
you
came
by
that
mourning
nose

do
it

here
a
gentleman
has
a
passionate
desire
to
kiss
your
hand
sir

honour
men
of
the
sword
and
i
presume
this
gentleman
is
lately
come
from
or
by
his
scars
no
really
sir
mine
sprung
from
civil
fury
happening
last
night
into
the
i
had
a
strong
inclination
to
go
ten
guineas
with
a
sort
of
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
milk
sop
as
i
thought
a
pox
of
the
dice
he
flung
out
and
my
pockets
being
empty
as
knows
they
sometimes
are
he
prov
a
surly
and
broke
my
face
for
my
deficiency
sir
ha
ha
and
did
not
you
draw
draw
sir
why
i
did
but
lay
my
hand
upon
my
sword
to
make
a
swift
retreat
and
he
roar
out
now
the
deel
a
ma
sol
sir
gin
ye
touch
yer
steel
ise
whip
mine
through
yer
wem
sir
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
fase
was
the
word
so
you
walk
off
i
suppose
yes
for
i
avoid
fighting
purely
to
be
serviceable
to
my
friends
you
know
sir
your
friends
are
much
oblig
to
you
sir
i
hope
you
rank
me
in
that
number
sir
a
bow
from
the
side
box
or
to
be
seen
in
your
chariot
binds
me
ever
yours
sir
trifles
you
may
command
when
you
please
provided
he
may
command
you

why
i
live
for
no
other
purpose

i
have
the
honour

most
of
the

gravity
of
a
statesman

my
sister

your
sake
i
hate

well
i
say
the
world

his
inside
cunning

him
every
heir

half
persuaded

man
of

pleasant
fellow

diverting
sometimes
or
there
wou
be
no
enduring
his
impertinence
he
is
pressing
to
be
employ
and
willing
to
execute
but
some
ill
fate
generally
attends
all
he
undertakes
and
he
oftner
spoils
an
intreague

cloaths
for
a
disguise
comes
my
old
master
into
his
closet

this
struck
us
into
a
terrible
fright
at
length
i
put

a
grave
face
and
ask
him
if
he
was
at
leisure
for
his
chocolate

hole
but
he
snap

my
poor
mistress
seeing
no
way
of
escape
order
me
to
wait
on
your
ladiship
with
the
sad
relation
unhappy
was
ever
any
thing
so
unaccountable
as
the
humour
of
sir
oh
madam
it
his
living
so
long
in
he
vows
spend
half
his
estate
but
he
be
a
on
purpose
to
bring
in
a
bill
for
women
to
wear
veils
and
the
other
odious
customs
he
swears
it
is
the
height
of
impudence
to
have
a
woman
seen
even
at
church
and
scarce
believes
there
a
true
begotten
child
in
the
city
ha
ha
ha
how
the
old
fool
torments
himself
suppose
he
could
introduce
his
rigid
rules
does
he
think
we
cou
not
match
them
in
contrivance
no
no
let
the
tyrant
man
make
what
laws
he
will
if
there
a
woman
under
the
government
i
warrant
she
finds
a
way
to
break
is
his
mind
set
upon
the
for
his
still
ay
and
he
expects
him
by
the
next
fleet
which
drives
his
daughter
to
melancholy
and
despair
but
madam
i
find
you
retain
the
same
gay
cheerful
spirit
you
had
when
i
waited
on
your
my
lady
is
mighty
too
and
i
have
found
a
way
to
make
sir
believe
i
am
wholly
in
his
interest
when
my
real
design
is
to
serve
her
he
makes
me
her
jaylor
and
i
set
her
at
liberty
i
know
thy
prolifick
brain
wou
be
of
singular
service
to
her
or
i
had
not
parted
with
thee
to
her
father
but
madam
the
report
is
that
you
are
going
to
marry
your
guardian
it
is
necessary
such
a
report
shou
be
but
is
it
true
madam
that
not
absolutely
necessary
i
thought
it
was
only
the
old
strain
coaxing
him
still
for
your
own
and
railing
at
all
the
young
fellows
about
town
in
my
mind
now
you
are
as
ill
plagu
with
your
guardian
madam
as
my
lady
is
with
her
father
no
i
have
liberty
wench
that
she
wants
what
would
she
give
now
to
be
in
this
in
the
open
air
nay
more
in
pursuit
of
the
young
fellow
she
likes
for
that
my
case
i
assure
thee
as
for
that
madam
she
even
with
you
for
tho
she
come
abroad
we
have
a
way
to
bring
him
home
in
spight
of
old
now
your
opinion
of
my
choice
for
here
he
comes
ha
my
guardian
with
him
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
i
sure
sir
ca
know
me
in
this
dress
let
observe
sir
and
sir
sir
verily
sir
thou
wilt
repent
throwing
away
thy
money
so
for
i
tell
thee
sincerely
my
charge
do
not
love
a
young
fellow
they
are
all
vicious
and
seldom
make
good
husbands
in
sober
sadness
she
can
not
abide
in
sober
sadness
you
are
mistaken
what
can
this
mean
sir
look
ye
sir
whether
she
can
or
can
not
abide
young
fellows
is
not
the
business
will
you
take
the
fifty
guineas
sir
in
good
truth
i
will
not
for
i
knew
thy
father
he
was
a
hearty
wary
man
and
i
can
not
consent
that
his
son
should
squander
away
what
he
sav
to
no
purpose
now
in
the
name
of
wonder
what
bargain
can
he
be
driving
about
me
for
fifty
guineas
i
wish
it
be
for
the
first
night
lodging
madam
sir
well
sir
since
you
are
so
conscientious
for
my
father
sake
then
permit
me
the
favour

favour
oh
my
life
i
believe
is
as
you
said
sir
no
verily
if
thou
dost
not
buy
thy
experience
thou
never
be
wise
therefore
give
me
a
hundred
and
try
fortune
sir
the
scruples
arose
i
find
from
the
scanty
sum
let
me
see
a
hundred
guineas
out
of
a
purse
and
chinks
ha
they
have
a
very
pretty
sound
and
a
very
pleasing
look
but
then
but
if
she
should
be
cruel
as
ten
to
one
i
shall

do
consider
o

thousand
things
and
my
hopes
flatter
me
hers
answer
if
i
lucky
if
not
is
but
a
hundred
guineas
thrown
away
and
come
upon
what
sir
sir
ha
my
upon
a
woman
madam
they
are
the
worst
things
you
can
deal
in
and
damage
the
soonest
your
very
breath
destroys
and
i
fear
you
never
see
your
return
sir
ha
ha
sir
were
they
more
brittle
than
and
drop
to
pieces
with
a
touch
every
atom
of
her
i
have
ventur
at
if
she
is
but
mistress
of
thy
wit
ballances
ten
times
the
sum
prithee
let
me
see
thy
face
by
no
means
that
may
spoil
your
opinion
of
my
sense
sir
rather
confirm
it
madam
so
rob
the
lady
of
your
gallantry
sir
sir
no
child
a
dish
of
chocolate
in
the
morning
never
spoils
my
dinner
the
other
lady
i
design
a
set
meal
so
there
no
danger
matrimony
ha
ha
ha
what
crimes
have
you
committed
against
the
god
of
love
that
he
should
revenge
so
severely
to
stamp
husband
upon
your
forehead
sir
for
my
folly
in
having
so
often
met
you
here
without
pursuing
the
laws
of
nature
and
exercising
her
command
but
i
resolve
we
part
now
to
know
who
you
are
where
you
live
and
what
kind
of
flesh
and
blood
your
face
is
therefore
unmask
and
do
put
me
to
the
trouble
of
doing
it
for
you
my
face
is
the
same
flesh
and
blood
with
my
hand
sir
which
if
you
be
so
rude
to
provoke
sir
you
apply
it
to
my
cheek
the
ladies
favours
are
always
welcome
but
i
must
have
that
cloud
withdrawn
hold
of
remember
you
are
in
the
child
and
what
a
terrible
thing
would
it
be
to
lose
this
pretty
white
hand
and
how
will
it
sound
in
a
that
sir
rudely
pull
off
a
ladies
mask
when
he
had
given
her
his
honour
that
he
never
would
directly
or
indirectly
endeavour
to
know
her
till
she
gave
him
leave
i
wish
we
were
safe
out
sir
but
if
that
lady
thinks
fit
to
pursue
and
meet
me
at
every
turn
like
some
troubl
spirit
shall
i
be
blam
if
i
inquire
into
the
reality
i
would
have
nothing
dissatisfy
in
a
female
shape
what
shall
i
do
sir
ay
prithee
consider
for
thou
shalt
find
me
very
much
at
thy
service
suppose
sir
the
lady
shou
be
in
love
with
you
sir
oh
i
return
the
obligation
in
a
moment
and
marry
her
sir
ha
ha
ha
that
not
the
way
to
love
her
child
if
he
discovers
me
i
shall
die
which
way
shall
i
escape
let
me
see
sir
well
madam

have
it
sir
is
fit
you
should
allow
something
if
you
excuse
my
face
and
turn
your
back

you
look
upon
me

shall
sink

secret

it
sir

what
to

favour
at
the
price
of
a
thousand

out
an

for
a
wench
or
by

carelessness
enrich
your

drinking
dressing

thy
beauteous
hand
bold
of
her
till
by
degrees
i
reach
thy
snowy
breasts
then
ravish
kisses
thus
her
in
and
flings
from
oh
heavens
i
shall
not
be
able
to
contain
my
self
sir
up
with
his
watch
in
his
sure
she
did
not
speak
to
him
there
three
quarters
of
the
hour
gone
sir
adod
i
do
like
those
close
conferences
sir
more
interruptions
you
will
have
it
sir
his
hand
to
his
sir
no
no
you
sha
have
her
neither
sir
dumb
still
sure
this
old
dog
has
enjoyn
her
silence
try
another
way
i
must
conclude
madam
that
in
compliance
to
your
guardian
humour
you
refuse
to
answer
me
consider
the
injustice
of
his
injunction
this
single
hour
cost
me
a
hundred
pound
and
wou
you
answer
me
i
cou
purchase
the
so
however
madam
you
must
give
me
leave
to
make
the
best
interpretation
i
can
for
my
money
and
take
the
indication
of
your
silence
for
the
secret
liking
of
my
person
therefore
madam
i
will
instruct
you
how
to
keep
your
word
inviolate
to
sir
and
yet
answer
me
to
every
question
as
for
example
when
i
ask
any
thing
to
which
you
wou
reply
in
the
affirmative
gently
nod
your
head
thus
and
when
in
the
negative
thus
shakes
his
and
in
the
doubtful
a
tender
sigh
thus
how
every
action
charms
me
but
i
fit
him
for
signs
i
warrant
him
sir
ha
ha
ha
ha
poor
sir

it
by
his
desire
that
you
are
dumb
madam
to
all
that
i
can
say
sir
very
well
she
tractable
i
find
and
is
it
possible
that
you
can
love
him
miraculous
pardon
the
bluntness
of
my
questions
for
my
time
is
short
may
i
not
hope
to
supplant
him
in
your
esteem
good
she
answers
me
as
i
could
wish
you
not
consent
to
marry
him
then
how
doubtful
in
that
undone
again
humph
but
that
may
proceed
from
his
power
to
keep
her
out
of
her
estate
till
twenty
five
i
try
that
come
madam
i
can
not
think
you
hesitate
in
this
affair
out
of
any
motive
but
your
fortune

him

those
few
years

me
happy
with

the
purpose
shakes
her
head
and
points
to
sir
what
does

the
purpose

afraid
yon
old
cuff

fluttering
fops
imagine

but
here
a
proof
of
wisdom
in
my
charge
old
men
are
constant
young
men
live
at
large
the
frugal
hand
can
bills
at
sight
defray
when
he
that
lavish
is
has
nought
to
scene
to
sir
sir
sir
what
in
the
balcone
agen
notwithstanding
my
positive
commands
to
the
contrary
why
do
you
write
a
bill
upon
your
forehead
to
show
passengers
there
something
to
be
let
what
harm
can
there
be
in
a
little
fresh
air
sir
sir
is
your
constitution
so
hot
mistriss
that
it
wants
cooling
ha
apply
the
virtuous
rules
banish
your
tast
and
thoughts
of
flesh
feed
upon
roots
and
quench
your
thirst
with
water
that
and
a
close
room
wou
certainly
make
me
die
of
the
vapours
sir
no
mistriss
is
your
lusty
rambling
rampant
ladies
that
are
troubl
with
the
vapours
is
your
ratifia
persico
cynamon
citron
and
spirit
of
clary
cause
such
swi
m
ing
in
the
brain
that
carries
many
a
guinea
to
the
doctor
but
you
are
not
to
be
bred
this
way
no
galloping
abroad
no
receiving
visits
at
home
for
in
our
loose
country
the
women
are
as
dangerous
as
the
men
so
i
told
her
sir
and
that
it
was
not
decent
to
be
seen
in
a
balcone
but
she
threaten
to
slap
my
chaps
and
told
me
i
was
her
servant
not
her
governess
sir
did
she
so
but
i
make
her
to
know
that
you
are
her
oh
that
incomparable
custom
of
why
here
no
depending
upon
old
women
in
my
country
for
they
are
as
wanton
at
eighty
as
a
girl
of
eighteen
and
a
man
may
as
safely
trust
to
translation
as
to
his
great
not
marrying
agen
or
to
the
ladies
veils
and
for
the
safeguard
of
their
honour
sir
dare
to
ridicule
the
cautious
conduct
of
that
wise
nation
and
i
have
you
lock
up
this
fortnight
without
a
peephole
if
we
had
but
the
ghostly
helps
in
which
they
have
in
i
might
deceive
you
if
you
did
sir
is
not
the
restraint
but
the
innate
principles
secures
the
reputation
and
honour
of
our
sex
let
me
tell
you
sir
confinement
sharpens
the
invention
as
want
of
sight
strengthens
the
other
senses
and
is
often
more
pernicious
than
the
recreation
innocent
liberty
allows
sir
say
you
so
mistress
who
the
devil
taught
you
the
art
of
reasoning
i
assure
you
they
must
have
a
greater
faith
than
i
pretend
to
that
can
think
any
woman
innocent
who
requires
liberty

to
your
charge
i
give
her
lock

if
you
consent
whilst
the
furious
beast
is
abroad
i
free
you
from
the
reach
of
his
paws
that
wou
be
but
to
avoid
one
danger
by
running
into
another
like
the
poor
wretches
who
fly
the
burning
ship
and
meet
their
fate
in
the
water
come
come
i
fear
if
i
consult
my
reason
confinement
and
plenty
is
better
than
liberty
and
starving
i
know
make
the
frolick
pleasing
for
a
little
time
by
saying
and
doing
a
world
of
tender
things
but
when
our
small
substance
is
once
exhausted
and
a
thousand
requisits
for
life
are
wanting
love
who
rarely
dwells
with
poverty
wou
also
fail
us
faith
i
fancy
not
methinks
my
heart
has
laid
up
a
stock
will
last
for
life
to
back
which
i
have
taken
a
thousand
pound
upon
my
uncle
estate
that
surely
will
support
us
till
one
of
our
fathers
relent
there
no
trusting
to
that
my
friend
i
doubt
your
father
will
carry
his
humour
to
the
grave
and
mine
till
he
sees
me
settled
in
and
can
ye
then
cruelly
resolve
to
stay
till
that
curs
arrives
and
suffer
that
youth
beauty
fire
and
wit
to
be
to
the
arms
of
a
dull
to
be
immur
and
forbid
the
sight
of
any
thing
that
humane
no
when
it
comes
to
the
extremity
and
no
stratagem
can
relieve
us
thou
shalt
list
for
a
soldier
and
i
carry
thy
knapsack
after
thee
bravely
resolv
the
world
can
not
be
more
savage
than
our
parents
and
fortune
generally
assists
the
bold
therefore
consent
now
why
shou
we
put
it
to
a
future
hazard
who
knows
when
we
shall
have
another
opportunity
oh
you
have
your
ladder
of
ropes
i
suppose
and
the
closet
window
stands
just
where
it
did
and
if
you
ha
forgot
to
write
in
characters
will
find
a
way
for
our
assignations
thus
much
of
the
contrivance
my
father
severity
has
taught
me
i
thank
him
tho
i
hate
the
nation
i
admire
their
management
in
these
affairs
oh
madam

see
my
master

sir
and
with

ha
ha
is
some
comfort
to
have
a
companion
in
our
sufferings
i
am
only
apprehensive
for
her
father
humour
is
implacable
and
how
far
his
jealousie
may
transport
him
to
her
undoing
shocks
my
soul
to
think
sir
but
since
you
escap
undiscover
by
him
his
rage
will
quickly
lash
into
a
calm
never
fear
it
but
who
knows
what
that
unlucky
dog
told
him
nor
can
i
imagine
what
brought
him
thither
that
fellow
is
ever
doing
mischief
and
yet
to
give
him
his
due
he
never
designs
it
this
is
some
blundering
adventure
wherein
he
thought
to
shew
his
friendship
as
he
calls
it
a
curse
on
him
sir
then
you
must
forgive
him
what
said
he
said
nay
i
had
more
mind
to
cut
his
throat
than
hear
his
excuses
sir
where
is
he
sir
i
saw
him
go
into
sir
just
now
oh
then
he
is
upon
your
business
sir
a
thousand
to
one
but
he
makes
some
mistake
there
too
sir
impossible
without
he
huffs
the
lady
and
makes
love
to
sir
is
below
gentlemen
and
desires
to
know
if
he
may
have
leave
to
wait
upon
ye
how
civil
the
rogue
is
when
he
has
done
a
fault
sir
ho
desire
him
to
walk
up
prithee
throw
off
this
chagreen
and
be
good

sheepish
look

a
man
already
under

affliction

sure
i
always
intend
to
serve
my
friends
but
if
my
malicious
stars
deny
the
happiness
is
the
fault
mine

is
eat
up
with
spleen
but
tell
me
what

which

a
letter
here

i
to
carry
an
answer
of
i
ca
think
what
language
the
direction

but
a
character
which
the
lovers
invented
to
avert
discovery
ha
i
hear
my
old
master
coming
down
stairs
it
is
impossible
you
shou
have
an
answer
away
and
bid

begone
we
are
ruined

go
i
go

this
was
certainly
for
my
daughter
but
i
do
know

fancy
i
saw
tail
sweep
by
that
wench
may
be
a
slut
and
instead
of

little
fruit

last
prodigal
oration

not
one
bare
single
word
in

voice
of
my
why
did
you
take
ten
thousand
ways
to
captivate
a
heart
your
eyes
alone
had
vanquish
prithee
no
more
of
these
flights
for
our
time
but
short
and
we
must
fall
into
business
do
you
think
we
can
agree
on
that
same
terrible
bugbear
without
heartily
repenting
on
both
sides

has
been
my
wish
since
first
my
longing
eyes
beheld

your
happy
ears
drank
in

had
thirty
thousand
pound
sir
unkind
did

not
offer
you
in
those
purchas
minutes
to
run
the
risque
of
your
fortune
so
you
wou
but
secure
that
lovely
person
to
my
arms
well
if
you
have
such
love
and
tenderness
since
our
woing
has
been
short

reserve
it
for
our
future
days
to
let
the
world
see
we
are
lovers
after
wedlock
be
a
novelty
sir
haste
then
and
let
us
tye
the
knot
and
prove
the
pair
hold
not
so
fast
i
have
provided
better
than
to
venture
on
dangerous
experiments
headlong
my
trusting
to
my
dissembled
love
has
given
up
my
fortune
to
my
own
dispose
but
with
this
that
he
to
morrow
morning
weds
me
he
is
now
gone
to
for
a
license
sir
ha
a
license
but
i
have
planted
emissaries
that
infallibly
take
him
down
to
under
pretence
that
a
brother
usurer
of
his
is
to
make
him
his
executor
the
thing
on
earth
he
covets
sir
is
his
known
character

my
instruments
confirm
him
this
man
is
dying

minute

overtures
of

those
little
hawking
females
that
traverse
the

the
to
