suppose
i
said
to
one
of
the
junior
clerks
at
our
office
the
other
day
you
were
asked
to
describe
yourself
in
a
few
words
could
you
do
it
his
answer
that
he
could
describe
me
in
two
was
no
answer
at
all
also
the
two
words
were
not
a
description
and
were
so
offensive
that
i
did
not
continue
the
conversation
i
believe
there
are
but
few
people
who
could
give
you
an
accurate
description
of
themselves
often
in
the
train
to
and
from
the
city
or
while
walking
in
the
street
i
think
over
myself
what
i
have
been
what
i
am
what
i
might
be
if
financially
speaking
it
would
run
to
it
i
imagine
how
i
should
act
under
different
circumstances
on
the
receipt
of
a
large
legacy
or
if
for
some
specially
clever
action
i
were
taken
into
partnership
or
if
a
mad
bull
came
down
the
street
i
may
say
that
i
make
a
regular
study
of
myself
i
have
from
time
to
time
recorded
on
paper
some
of
the
more
important
incidents
of
our
married
life
affecting
eliza
and
myself
and
i
present
them
to
you
gentle
reader
in
this
little
volume
i
think
they
show
how
with
a
very
limited
income
and
but
for
occasional
assistance
from
eliza
mother
i
do
not
know
how
we
should
have
got
along
a
man
may
to
a
great
extent
preserve
respectability
show
taste
and
judgment
and
manage
his
wife
and
home
the
more
i
think
about
myself
the
more
i
say
it
in
all
modesty
the
subject
seems
to
grow
i
should
call
myself
and
in
many
respects
unlike
ordinary
men
take
for
instance
the
question
of
taste
some
people
would
hardly
think
it
worth
while
to
mention
a
little
thing
like
taste
but
i
do
i
am
not
rich
but
what
i
have
i
like
to
have
ornamental
though
not
loud
only
the
other
day
the
question
of
for
the
kitchen
turned
up
and
though
those
with
the
red
border
were
threepence
a
dozen
dearer
than
the
plain
i
ordered
them
without
hesitation
eliza
changed
them
next
day
contrary
to
my
wishes
and
we
had
a
few
words
about
it
but
that
is
not
the
point
the
real
point
is
that
if
your
taste
comes
out
in
a
matter
of
for
the
kitchen
it
will
also
come
out
in
antimacassars
for
the
and
higher
things
again
ordinary
men
men
that
might
possibly
call
themselves
my
equals
are
not
careful
enough
about
respectability
everywhere
around
me
i
see
betting
on
check
trousers
on
sunday
the
wash
hung
out
in
the
front
garden
whiskey
and
soda
front
steps
not
properly
whitened
and
the
not
up
to
the
mark
i
could
point
to
houses
where
late
hours
on
sunday
are
so
much
the
rule
that
the
lady
of
the
house
comes
down
in
her
to
take
in
the
milk
which
i
am
sure
eliza
would
sooner
die
than
do
there
are
families
in
my
own
neighbourhood
i
am
sorry
to
say
where
the
chimneys
are
not
swept
regularly
beer
is
fetched
in
broad
daylight
and
attendance
at
a
place
of
worship
on
sunday
is
rather
the
exception
than
the
rule
then
again
language
is
an
important
point
to
my
mind
nothing
marks
a
respectable
man
more
than
the
use
of
genteel
language
there
may
have
been
occasions
when
excessive
provocation
has
led
me
to
the
use
of
regrettable
expressions
but
they
have
been
few
as
a
rule
i
avoid
not
only
what
is
profane
but
also
anything
that
is
slangy
i
fail
to
understand
this
habit
which
the
present
generation
has
formed
of
picking
up
some
meaningless
phrase
and
using
it
in
season
and
out
of
season
for
some
weeks
i
have
been
greatly
annoyed
by
the
way
some
of
the
clerks
use
the
phrase
what
ho
she
bumps
if
you
ask
them
who
bumps
or
how
or
why
they
have
no
answer
but
fits
of
silly
laughter
probably
before
these
words
appear
in
print
that
phrase
will
have
been
forgotten
and
another
equally
ridiculous
will
have
taken
its
place
it
is
not
sensible
what
is
worse
it
is
not
to
my
mind
respectable
do
not
imagine
that
i
object
to
humour
in
conversation
that
is
a
very
different
thing
i
have
made
humourous
remarks
myself
before
now
mostly
of
rather
a
cynical
and
sarcastic
kind
i
am
fond
of
my
home
and
any
little
addition
to
its
furniture
or
decorations
gives
me
sincere
pleasure
both
in
the
home
and
in
our
manner
of
life
there
are
many
improvements
which
i
am
prevented
by
financial
considerations
from
carrying
out
if
i
were
a
rich
man
i
would
have
the
walls
a
perfect
mass
of
pictures
if
i
had
money
i
could
spend
it
judiciously
and
without
absurdity
i
should
have
the
address
stamped
in
gold
on
the
and
use
and
never
be
without
a
cake
in
the
house
in
case
a
friend
dropped
in
to
tea
nor
should
i
think
twice
about
putting
on
an
extra
clean
pair
of
cuffs
in
the
week
if
wanted
we
should
keep
two
servants
i
am
interested
in
the
drama
if
serious
and
two
or
three
times
every
month
i
should
take
eliza
to
the
our
suburb
has
a
train
service
which
is
particularly
convenient
for
the
theatres
eliza
would
wear
a
dressy
blouse
she
shares
my
objections
to
anything
cut
out
at
the
neck
a
mackintosh
and
a
sailor
hat
the
two
latter
to
be
removed
before
entering
i
should
carry
her
evening
shoes
in
a
pretty
bag
we
have
often
discussed
it
curiously
enough
she
already
has
the
bag
though
we
seldom
have
an
opportunity
to
use
it
in
this
way
doubtless
there
are
many
other
innovations
which
with
appropriate
means
i
could
suggest
but
i
have
said
enough
to
show
that
they
would
all
be
in
the
direction
of
refinement
and
elegance
and
the
money
would
not
be
spent
in
foolishness
or
vice
as
eliza
husband
i
should
perhaps
say
a
word
or
two
about
her
she
is
a
lady
of
high
principles
and
great
activity
owing
to
my
absence
every
day
in
the
exercise
of
my
profession
she
is
called
upon
to
settle
many
questions
as
for
instance
the
other
day
the
question
of
what
contribution
if
any
should
be
given
to
the
local
fire
brigade
where
a
word
of
advice
from
me
would
have
been
useful
if
not
actually
independent
she
is
certainly
not
what
would
be
described
as
a
clinging
woman
indeed
she
does
occasionally
take
upon
herself
to
enter
on
a
line
of
action
without
consulting
me
when
my
advice
is
perfectly
at
her
disposal
and
would
perhaps
save
her
from
blunders
last
year
she
filled
the
unusually
large
for
the
type
of
house
right
up
at
summer
prices
undoubtedly
she
thought
that
she
was
practising
an
economy
but
she
was
dealing
with
a
who
does
not
give
credit
a
man
who
requires
cash
down
and
sees
that
he
gets
it
and
well
i
need
not
go
into
details
here
but
it
proved
to
be
excessively
inconvenient
for
me
she
has
lost
the
silly
playfulness
which
was
rather
a
mark
of
her
character
during
the
period
of
our
engagement
and
if
this
is
due
to
the
sobering
effects
of
association
with
a
steady
and
thoughtful
character
i
am
not
displeased
she
herself
says
it
the
work
but
the
women
do
not
always
know
possibly
too
her
temper
is
more
easily
ruffled
now
than
then
when
i
point
out
things
to
her
i
should
say
that
she
was
less
ambitious
than
myself
i
do
not
mention
these
little
matters
at
all
by
way
of
finding
fault
on
the
contrary
i
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
eliza
illustration
the
right
up
at
summer
we
have
no
children
living
with
these
few
prefatory
words
gentle
reader
i
fling
open
the
front
door
to
use
a
metaphorical
expression
and
invite
you
to
witness
a
few
scenes
of
our
domestic
life
that
i
have
from
time
to
time
recorded
the
cards
about
a
year
ago
eliza
and
myself
had
a
little
difference
of
opinion
i
mentioned
to
her
that
we
had
no
of
course
not
she
said
the
idea
of
such
a
thing
she
spoke
rather
hastily
why
do
you
say
course
not
i
replied
quietly
are
i
believe
in
common
use
among
ladies
and
gentlemen
she
said
she
did
not
see
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
it
has
just
this
much
to
do
with
it
i
answered
that
i
do
not
intend
to
go
without
another
day
what
the
use
she
asked
we
never
call
on
anybody
and
nobody
ever
calls
on
us
is
miss
sakers
nobody
well
she
never
left
a
card
here
and
she
really
is
a
lady
by
birth
and
can
prove
it
she
just
asks
the
girl
to
say
she
been
and
nothing
of
importance
when
she
does
find
me
in
if
she
can
do
without
cards
we
can
you
much
better
go
by
her
thank
you
i
have
my
own
ideas
of
propriety
and
i
do
not
take
them
from
miss
sakers
i
shall
order
fifty
of
each
sort
from
amrod
this
morning
then
that
makes
a
hundred
cards
wasted
either
you
can
not
count
i
said
or
you
have
yet
to
learn
that
there
are
three
sorts
of
cards
used
by
married
people
the
husband
cards
the
wife
cards
and
the
card
with
both
names
on
it
go
it
said
eliza
get
a
card
for
the
cat
as
well
she
knows
a
lot
more
cats
than
we
know
people
i
could
have
given
a
fairly
sharp
retort
to
that
but
i
preferred
to
remain
absolutely
silent
i
thought
it
might
show
eliza
that
she
was
becoming
rather
vulgar
silence
is
often
the
best
rebuke
however
eliza
went
on
mother
would
hate
it
i
know
that
to
talk
about
cards
with
the
last
lot
of
coals
not
paid
for
i
call
it
wickedness
i
simply
walked
out
of
the
house
went
straight
down
to
amrod
and
ordered
those
cards
when
the
time
comes
for
me
to
put
my
foot
down
i
can
generally
put
it
down
as
well
as
most
people
no
one
could
be
easier
to
live
with
than
i
am
and
i
am
sure
eliza
has
found
it
so
but
what
i
say
is
if
a
man
is
not
master
in
his
own
house
then
where
is
he
amrod
printed
the
cards
while
i
waited
i
had
them
done
in
the
old
english
character
i
suggested
some
little
decoration
to
give
them
a
tone
an
ivy
leaf
in
the
corner
or
a
little
flourish
under
the
name
but
amrod
was
opposed
to
this
he
seemed
to
think
it
was
not
essential
and
it
would
have
been
charged
extra
and
also
he
had
nothing
of
the
kind
in
stock
so
i
let
that
pass
the
cards
looked
very
well
as
they
were
a
little
plain
and
formal
perhaps
but
very
clean
except
in
the
case
of
a
few
where
the
ink
had
rubbed
and
very
gratifying
to
one
natural
illustration
seemed
to
think
it
was
not
that
evening
i
took
a
small
cardboard
box
that
had
contained
candles
and
packed
in
it
a
few
carefully
selected
flowers
from
the
garden
and
one
of
our
cards
on
the
card
i
wrote
with
kindest
love
from
just
above
the
names
and
posted
it
to
eliza
mother
so
far
was
eliza
mother
from
being
offended
that
she
sent
eliza
a
present
of
a
for
five
shillings
three
pounds
of
pressed
beef
and
a
nicely
worked
apron
on
glancing
over
that
sentence
i
see
that
it
is
perhaps
a
little
ambiguous
the
postal
order
was
for
the
shillings
alone
not
for
the
beef
or
the
apron
i
only
mention
the
incident
to
show
whether
in
this
case
eliza
or
i
was
right
i
put
a
few
of
my
own
cards
in
my
and
the
rest
were
packed
away
in
a
drawer
a
few
weeks
afterward
i
was
annoyed
to
find
eliza
using
some
of
her
cards
for
winding
silks
she
said
that
it
did
not
prevent
them
from
being
used
again
if
they
were
ever
wanted
pardon
me
i
said
but
cards
for
social
purposes
should
not
be
bent
or
frayed
at
the
edge
and
can
hardly
be
too
clean
oblige
me
by
not
doing
that
again
that
evening
eliza
told
me
that
no
in
the
crescent
had
been
taken
by
some
people
called
popworth
that
must
be
young
popworth
who
used
to
be
in
our
office
i
said
i
heard
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
this
year
you
must
certainly
call
and
leave
cards
which
sort
and
how
many
without
referring
to
a
book
i
can
hardly
say
precisely
these
things
are
very
much
a
matter
of
taste
leave
enough
say
one
of
each
sort
for
each
person
in
the
house
there
should
be
no
stint
how
am
i
to
know
how
many
persons
there
are
ask
the
butcher
with
whom
they
deal
on
the
following
day
i
remarked
that
popworth
must
have
come
in
for
money
to
be
taking
so
large
a
house
and
i
hoped
she
had
left
the
cards
i
asked
the
butcher
and
he
said
there
was
popworth
his
wife
two
sisters
a
german
friend
and
eleven
children
that
was
sixteen
persons
and
made
cards
altogether
you
see
i
remembered
your
rule
my
dear
eliza
i
said
i
told
you
as
plainly
as
possible
that
it
was
a
matter
of
taste
you
ought
not
to
have
left
at
once
oh
i
could
keep
running
backwards
and
forwards
leaving
a
few
at
a
time
i
got
something
else
to
do
there
three
pair
of
your
socks
in
the
basket
waiting
to
be
darned
as
it
is
and
good
heavens
that
popworth
ca
be
my
popworth
if
he
only
married
this
year
he
ca
in
the
nature
of
things
have
got
eleven
children
and
a
house
like
this
ca
call
on
a
house
like
that
without
a
something
to
justify
it
that
what
i
thought
then
what
on
earth
did
you
call
for
i
did
who
said
i
did
i
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
later
in
the
evening
when
eliza
took
a
card
notched
a
bit
out
of
each
side
and
began
winding
silk
on
it
i
thought
it
wiser
to
say
nothing
it
is
better
sometimes
to
pretend
not
to
see
things
eliza
mother
i
generally
send
eliza
to
spend
a
day
with
her
mother
early
in
december
and
try
to
cheer
her
up
a
little
i
daresay
the
old
lady
is
very
lonely
and
appreciates
the
kindly
thought
the
return
ticket
is
and
eliza
generally
buys
a
few
flowers
to
take
with
her
that
does
not
leave
much
change
out
of
five
shillings
when
the
day
is
over
but
i
do
grudge
the
money
eliza
mother
generally
tries
to
find
out
without
precisely
asking
what
we
should
like
for
a
christmas
present
eliza
does
not
actually
tell
her
or
even
hint
it
she
would
not
care
to
do
anything
of
that
sort
but
she
manages
in
a
tactful
sort
of
way
to
let
her
know
for
instance
the
year
before
last
eliza
mother
happened
to
say
i
wonder
if
you
know
what
i
am
going
to
give
you
this
christmas
eliza
said
i
can
see
in
your
eye
mother
and
you
do
it
much
too
expensive
if
other
people
can
do
without
silver
i
suppose
we
can
well
we
got
them
so
that
was
all
right
but
last
year
it
was
more
difficult
you
see
early
in
last
december
i
went
over
my
accounts
and
i
could
see
that
i
was
short
for
one
thing
eliza
had
had
the
measles
then
i
had
bought
a
bicycle
and
though
i
sold
it
again
it
did
not
in
that
broken
state
bring
in
enough
to
pay
the
compensation
to
the
cabman
i
was
much
annoyed
about
that
it
was
true
i
ran
into
the
horse
but
it
was
not
my
fault
that
it
bolted
and
went
into
the
as
i
said
rather
sharply
to
the
man
when
i
paid
him
if
his
horse
had
been
steady
the
thing
would
never
have
happened
he
did
not
know
what
to
answer
and
made
some
silly
remark
about
my
not
being
fit
to
ride
a
mangle
both
then
and
at
the
time
of
the
accident
his
language
was
disrespectful
and
profane
however
i
need
not
go
further
into
that
it
is
enough
to
say
that
we
had
some
unusual
expenses
and
were
distinctly
short
i
do
blame
you
eliza
i
said
anything
you
have
had
you
are
very
welcome
to
i
have
had
anything
except
the
measles
she
said
and
i
see
how
you
can
blame
me
for
that
but
i
said
i
think
it
high
time
you
paid
a
visit
to
your
mother
and
showed
her
that
we
have
not
forgotten
her
take
some
swiss
roll
about
sixpennyworth
try
to
make
things
seem
a
little
brighter
to
her
if
she
says
anything
about
christmas
and
you
saw
your
way
to
getting
a
cheque
from
her
this
year
instead
of
her
usual
present
you
might
do
that
but
show
her
that
we
are
really
fond
of
her
remember
she
is
your
mother
and
has
few
pleasures
a
fiver
just
now
would
make
a
good
deal
of
difference
to
me
and
even
a
couple
of
sovereigns
would
be
very
handy
when
eliza
came
back
i
saw
by
her
face
that
it
was
all
right
i
did
have
to
say
anything
she
said
mother
told
me
of
her
own
accord
that
she
knew
that
you
had
money
troubles
and
that
she
was
going
to
take
advantage
of
the
christmas
season
to
relieve
you
from
them
in
a
way
which
at
another
time
you
might
be
too
proud
to
accept
that
i
said
warmly
is
very
thoughtful
of
her
and
very
delicate
and
it
can
only
mean
one
thing
it
settles
me
this
year
eliza
we
will
give
your
mother
a
present
quite
a
trifle
of
course
about
two
shillings
it
will
be
a
token
and
she
will
value
it
when
i
returned
from
the
city
i
found
that
eliza
had
purchased
a
small
white
vase
for
the
man
in
the
shop
had
told
her
that
it
was
alabaster
i
had
my
doubts
about
that
but
it
was
quite
in
my
own
taste
rather
severe
and
classical
i
complimented
eliza
on
her
choice
three
days
before
christmas
i
got
a
letter
from
eliza
mother
she
said
that
she
had
been
afraid
that
i
was
worrying
about
my
debt
to
her
of
she
took
advantage
of
the
christmas
season
to
return
my
and
begged
me
to
consider
the
debt
as
paid
it
was
not
at
all
what
i
had
expected
no
i
said
to
eliza
at
breakfast
i
am
not
in
the
least
like
a
bear
with
a
sore
head
and
i
will
thank
you
not
to
use
the
expression
as
for
your
mother
kindness
i
am
glad
you
think
it
kindness
i
have
it
otherwise
if
you
were
a
born
idiot
you
would
think
so
my
debt
to
your
mother
would
have
been
discharged
by
discharged
in
due
course
by
reminding
me
that
i
owed
her
money
she
has
practically
dunned
me
for
it
and
forced
me
to
pay
her
at
a
most
inconvenient
time
she
comes
badgering
me
for
her
dirty
money
at
christmas
and
you
call
it
kindness
hah
oh
hah
hah
do
make
those
silly
noises
and
get
on
with
your
breakfast
said
eliza
afterward
she
asked
me
if
i
still
meant
to
send
her
mother
that
little
vase
oh
yes
i
said
we
can
afford
it
it
nothing
to
us
eliza
entirely
misunderstanding
the
word
that
i
next
used
got
up
and
said
that
she
would
not
stop
in
the
room
to
hear
her
poor
mother
sworn
at
the
word
i
used
i
said
calmly
was
alabaster
and
not
what
you
suppose
you
pronounced
it
just
like
the
other
thing
i
pronounced
it
in
an
exclamatory
manner
i
replied
from
contempt
you
seem
to
me
very
ready
to
think
evil
this
is
not
the
first
time
eliza
apologized
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
really
did
say
alabaster
but
i
said
it
emphatically
and
i
own
that
it
relieved
my
feelings
we
keep
the
silver
in
the
drawer
of
eliza
wardrobe
as
a
general
rule
i
should
prefer
to
use
them
every
day
or
at
any
rate
every
sunday
but
eliza
says
that
they
make
work
mother
has
written
to
me
she
said
on
the
following
day
to
say
that
she
will
dine
with
us
on
christmas
day
i
had
better
get
the
silver
down
you
better
them
i
said
meaningly
i
know
that
sounds
rather
bitter
but
i
confess
that
i
have
always
had
a
weakness
for
the
wit
that
stings
well
it
did
not
actually
come
to
that
they
allowed
me
to
draw
a
couple
of
pounds
in
advance
at
the
office
i
suppose
they
know
that
when
they
have
got
a
good
man
it
is
worth
while
to
stretch
a
point
to
keep
him
not
that
i
was
at
all
dictatorial
apparently
i
asked
it
as
a
favour
but
i
fancy
our
manager
saw
that
i
was
not
a
man
to
be
played
with
eliza
mother
dined
with
us
and
brought
a
couple
of
ducks
conscience
i
should
say
at
the
moment
of
writing
my
financial
position
is
absolutely
sound
and
even
if
eliza
mother
forced
me
to
use
her
present
to
me
to
pay
my
debt
to
her
though
i
might
think
it
dishonourable
on
her
part
i
should
not
be
seriously
inconvenienced
however
eliza
is
going
early
in
december
to
suggest
plated
that
is
to
say
she
may
possibly
mention
them
if
any
occasion
arises
miss
sakers
on
saturdays
i
always
get
back
from
the
office
early
this
particular
saturday
afternoon
i
looked
at
our
chimneys
as
i
came
down
the
street
i
thought
it
very
queer
but
to
make
certain
as
soon
as
i
got
into
the
house
i
opened
the
door
it
was
just
as
i
thought
i
called
to
eliza
rather
sharply
she
came
down
and
said
well
what
the
matter
i
said
calmly
the
matter
jane
has
apparently
gone
mad
that
all
jane
is
the
name
of
our
servant
eliza
said
that
she
did
not
think
so
and
asked
me
what
the
girl
had
done
i
must
say
it
made
me
feel
rather
sarcastic
it
would
have
made
any
man
feel
sarcastic
i
said
oh
nothing
merely
lit
the
fire
in
the
and
not
only
lit
it
but
piled
coals
on
it
it
is
not
sunday
so
far
as
i
am
aware
it
is
our
rule
to
have
the
fire
lit
on
sundays
only
we
are
rather
exclusive
and
some
other
people
seem
to
be
rather
and
between
the
two
we
do
not
have
many
callers
if
any
one
comes
it
is
always
perfectly
easy
for
eliza
to
say
the
housemaid
has
foolishly
forgotten
to
light
the
fire
here
shall
we
not
step
into
the
i
hate
to
see
anything
like
waste
at
this
very
moment
i
added
the
fire
is
flaming
up
the
chimney
it
seems
we
can
afford
to
burn
half
a
ton
of
coals
for
nothing
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
aware
of
it
you
satirical
said
eliza
i
always
know
when
you
are
being
satirical
because
you
move
your
eyebrows
and
say
am
aware
instead
of
know
i
told
jane
to
light
the
fire
myself
may
i
ask
why
miss
sakers
is
coming
in
she
sent
me
a
note
this
morning
to
say
so
that
puts
a
different
complexion
on
the
affair
very
tactful
of
her
to
have
announced
the
intention
i
do
not
grudge
a
handful
of
firing
when
there
is
a
reason
i
only
ask
that
there
shall
be
a
reason
miss
sakers
is
the
vicar
daughter
strictly
speaking
i
suppose
her
social
position
is
superior
to
our
own
i
know
for
a
fact
that
she
has
been
to
county
balls
she
seemed
anxious
to
cultivate
an
intimacy
with
us
so
i
gathered
i
was
not
absurdly
pleased
about
it
one
has
one
dignity
besides
at
the
office
we
frequently
see
people
far
above
miss
sakers
a
nobleman
who
had
called
to
see
one
of
the
partners
once
remarked
to
me
your
office
is
a
devilish
long
way
from
everywhere
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
he
should
have
spoken
to
me
but
he
seemed
to
wish
it
after
that
it
was
no
very
great
thing
that
miss
sakers
seemed
anxious
to
know
us
better
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
pretend
that
i
was
displeased
i
went
into
the
and
put
some
more
coal
on
is
it
to
be
a
party
i
asked
not
at
all
she
is
coming
quite
as
a
friend
i
went
and
changed
all
my
clothes
and
then
purchased
a
few
flowers
which
i
placed
in
vases
in
the
eliza
had
got
two
kinds
of
cake
i
added
a
plate
of
mixed
biscuits
on
my
own
responsibility
beyond
this
i
did
nothing
in
the
way
of
preparation
wishing
to
keep
the
thing
as
simple
and
informal
as
possible
the
tea
was
quite
a
success
miss
sakers
was
to
have
a
stall
at
the
bazaar
in
aid
of
the
new
church
i
promised
her
five
shillings
at
first
but
afterward
made
it
though
no
longer
young
miss
sakers
is
very
pleasant
in
her
manner
after
tea
miss
sakers
and
eliza
both
did
needlework
miss
sakers
was
doing
a
thing
in
crewels
i
could
not
see
what
eliza
was
doing
she
kept
it
hidden
almost
under
the
table
to
prevent
the
conversation
from
flagging
i
said
eliza
dear
what
are
you
making
she
frowned
hard
at
me
shook
her
head
slightly
and
asked
miss
sakers
about
the
special
preacher
for
epiphany
sunday
i
at
once
guessed
that
eliza
was
doing
something
for
miss
sakers
stall
at
the
bazaar
and
had
intended
to
keep
it
secret
i
smiled
miss
sakers
i
said
i
do
not
know
what
eliza
is
making
but
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
for
you
there
was
a
dead
silence
miss
sakers
and
eliza
both
blushed
then
miss
sakers
said
without
looking
at
me
i
think
you
are
mistaken
i
felt
so
sure
that
i
was
mistaken
that
i
blushed
too
eliza
hurriedly
hid
her
work
in
the
and
said
it
is
very
close
in
here
let
me
show
you
round
our
little
garden
they
both
went
out
without
taking
any
notice
of
me
not
having
had
much
tea
i
cut
myself
another
slice
of
cake
while
i
was
in
the
middle
of
it
miss
sakers
and
eliza
came
back
and
miss
sakers
said
to
me
very
coldly
i
offered
to
raise
my
bazaar
donation
to
ten
shillings
but
she
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
me
how
could
you
say
that
said
eliza
when
miss
sakers
had
gone
it
was
most
tactless
and
not
very
nice
i
thought
you
were
doing
something
for
the
bazaar
what
were
you
making
then
she
did
not
actually
tell
me
but
she
implied
it
in
a
delicate
way
well
i
said
of
course
i
would
have
called
attention
to
it
if
i
had
known
but
i
do
think
you
ought
to
have
been
doing
that
work
when
miss
sakers
was
here
i
no
time
to
waste
and
i
always
make
mine
myself
i
was
most
careful
to
keep
them
hidden
you
are
very
tactless
i
do
think
much
of
that
miss
sakers
i
said
why
should
we
go
to
this
expense
pointing
to
the
cakes
for
a
woman
of
that
kind
the
orchestrome
the
orchestrome
was
on
lady
sandlingbury
stall
at
the
bazaar
her
ladyship
came
up
to
eliza
in
the
friendliest
way
and
said
my
dear
lady
i
am
convinced
that
you
need
an
orchestrome
it
the
sweetest
instrument
in
the
world
worth
at
least
five
pounds
and
for
one
shilling
you
have
a
chance
of
getting
it
it
is
to
be
raffled
eliza
objects
on
principle
to
anything
like
gambling
but
as
this
was
for
the
deserving
inebriates
which
is
a
good
cause
she
paid
her
shilling
she
won
the
orchestrome
and
i
carried
it
home
for
her
six
tunes
were
given
with
the
orchestrome
each
tune
was
on
a
slip
of
perforated
paper
and
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
put
in
a
slip
and
touch
the
spring
we
tried
it
first
with
the
dandy
coloured
coon
it
certainly
played
something
but
it
was
not
right
there
was
no
recognizable
tune
about
it
this
wo
do
at
all
i
said
perhaps
that
tune
got
bent
or
something
said
eliza
put
in
another
i
put
in
the
lost
chord
and
the
old
folks
at
home
and
both
were
complete
failures
a
mere
jumble
of
notes
with
no
tune
in
them
at
all
i
confess
that
this
exasperated
me
you
see
what
you
done
i
said
you
fooled
away
a
shilling
nothing
is
more
idiotic
than
to
buy
a
thing
without
trying
it
first
why
did
you
say
that
before
then
said
eliza
i
do
believe
there
anything
really
wrong
with
it
just
some
little
thing
got
out
of
order
and
can
be
put
right
again
wrong
why
it
wrong
all
through
not
one
scrap
of
any
of
the
tunes
comes
out
right
i
shall
take
it
back
to
lady
sandlingbury
at
once
oh
do
do
that
but
my
mind
was
made
up
and
i
went
back
to
the
bazaar
and
up
to
lady
sandlingbury
stall
eliza
would
come
with
me
i
beg
your
ladyship
pardon
i
said
but
your
ladyship
supplied
me
with
this
orchestrome
and
your
ladyship
will
have
to
take
it
back
again
dear
me
what
all
the
trouble
i
started
the
instrument
and
let
her
hear
for
herself
she
smiled
and
turned
to
another
lady
who
was
helping
her
the
other
lady
was
young
and
very
pretty
but
with
a
scornful
kind
of
amused
expression
and
a
drawling
way
of
speaking
both
of
which
i
disliked
extremely
edith
said
lady
sandlingbury
here
this
angry
gentleman
going
to
put
us
both
in
prison
for
selling
him
a
bad
orchestrome
he
says
it
wo
work
does
matter
does
it
said
the
other
lady
i
mean
to
say
as
long
as
it
will
play
you
know
at
this
rather
stupid
remark
they
both
laughed
without
so
much
as
looking
at
me
i
do
want
to
make
myself
in
any
way
unpleasant
your
ladyship
i
said
but
this
instrument
was
offered
for
raffle
as
being
worth
five
pounds
and
it
not
worth
five
shillings
come
now
said
lady
sandlingbury
i
will
give
you
five
shillings
for
it
there
you
are
now
you
can
be
happy
and
go
and
spend
your
money
i
thanked
her
she
took
the
orchestrome
and
started
it
and
it
played
magnificently
nothing
could
have
been
more
perfect
these
things
do
better
she
said
when
you
do
put
the
tunes
in
wrong
end
first
so
that
the
instrument
plays
them
backwards
i
think
your
ladyship
might
have
told
me
that
before
i
said
oh
you
were
so
angry
and
you
did
ask
me
edith
dear
do
go
and
be
civil
to
some
people
and
make
them
take
tickets
for
another
raffle
i
call
this
sharp
practice
i
said
if
not
worse
and
here
the
other
lady
interrupted
me
could
you
please
go
away
unless
you
want
to
buy
something
thanks
so
much
illustration
you
please
go
away
i
went
i
am
rather
sorry
for
it
now
i
think
it
would
have
been
more
dignified
to
have
stopped
and
defied
them
eliza
appeared
to
think
that
i
had
made
myself
ridiculous
i
do
not
agree
with
her
i
do
think
however
that
when
members
of
the
aristocracy
practise
a
common
swindle
in
support
of
a
charity
they
go
to
show
that
rank
is
not
everything
if
miss
sakers
happens
to
ask
us
whether
we
are
going
to
the
bazaar
in
support
of
the
deserving
inebriates
next
year
i
have
instructed
eliza
to
reply
not
if
lady
sandlingbury
and
her
friend
have
a
stall
i
positively
refuse
to
meet
them
and
i
do
not
care
twopence
if
they
know
it
the
tonic
port
we
do
a
large
export
trade
that
is
the
firm
does
and
there
are
often
samples
lying
about
in
the
office
there
was
a
bottle
of
tonic
port
which
had
been
there
some
time
and
one
of
the
partners
told
the
head
clerk
that
he
could
have
it
if
he
liked
later
in
the
day
the
head
clerk
said
if
a
bottle
of
tarret
tonic
port
was
any
use
to
me
i
might
take
it
home
he
said
he
had
just
opened
it
and
tasted
it
because
he
did
not
like
to
give
anything
away
until
he
knew
if
it
was
all
right
i
thanked
him
tastes
i
said
just
like
any
ordinary
port
i
suppose
well
he
said
it
more
a
tonic
port
than
an
ordinary
port
but
that
only
what
you
expect
from
the
label
quite
so
i
said
quite
so
i
looked
at
the
label
and
saw
that
it
said
that
the
port
was
peculiarly
rich
in
phosphates
i
put
the
bottle
in
my
bag
that
night
and
took
it
home
eliza
i
said
i
have
brought
you
a
little
present
it
is
a
bottle
of
port
eliza
very
rarely
takes
anything
at
all
but
if
she
does
it
is
a
glass
of
port
in
this
respect
i
admire
her
taste
port
as
i
have
sometimes
said
to
her
is
the
king
of
wines
we
decided
that
we
would
have
a
glass
after
supper
that
is
really
the
best
time
to
take
anything
of
the
kind
the
wine
soothes
the
nerves
and
prevents
insomnia
eliza
picked
the
bottle
up
and
looked
at
the
label
why
she
said
you
told
me
it
was
port
so
it
is
it
says
tonic
port
on
the
label
well
tonic
port
practically
port
that
is
to
say
it
is
port
with
the
addition
of
er
phosphates
what
are
phosphates
oh
there
are
so
many
of
them
you
know
there
is
quinine
of
course
and
magnesium
and
and
so
on
let
me
fill
your
glass
she
took
one
very
little
sip
it
is
what
i
should
call
a
pleasant
wine
she
said
it
stings
so
ah
i
said
that
the
phosphates
it
would
be
a
little
like
that
but
that
not
the
way
to
judge
a
port
what
you
should
do
is
to
take
a
large
mouthful
and
roll
it
round
the
tongue
then
you
get
the
aroma
look
this
is
the
way
i
took
a
large
mouthful
when
i
had
stopped
coughing
i
said
that
i
did
know
that
there
was
anything
absolutely
wrong
with
the
wine
but
you
wanted
to
be
ready
for
it
it
had
come
on
me
rather
unexpectedly
eliza
said
that
very
likely
that
was
it
and
she
asked
me
if
i
would
care
to
finish
my
glass
now
that
i
knew
what
it
was
like
i
said
that
it
was
not
quite
a
fair
test
to
try
a
port
just
after
it
had
been
shaken
about
i
would
let
the
bottle
stand
for
a
day
or
two
ultimately
i
took
what
was
left
in
eliza
glass
and
my
own
and
emptied
it
into
the
garden
i
did
this
because
i
did
not
want
our
general
servant
to
try
it
when
she
cleared
away
and
possibly
acquire
a
taste
for
drink
next
morning
i
found
that
two
of
our
best
geraniums
had
died
during
the
night
i
said
that
it
was
most
inexplicable
eliza
said
nothing
a
few
nights
afterward
eliza
asked
me
if
i
thought
that
the
tonic
port
had
stood
long
enough
yes
i
said
i
will
decant
it
for
you
and
then
if
miss
sakers
calls
you
might
say
carelessly
that
you
were
just
going
to
have
a
glass
of
port
and
would
be
glad
if
she
would
join
you
no
thank
you
she
said
i
do
want
to
deceive
miss
sakers
you
could
mention
that
it
was
rich
in
phosphates
there
need
be
no
deception
about
it
well
then
i
do
want
to
lose
the
few
friends
we
got
as
you
please
eliza
it
seems
a
pity
to
waste
more
than
half
a
bottle
of
good
wine
bottle
of
what
you
heard
what
i
said
well
drink
it
yourself
if
you
like
it
some
weeks
afterward
i
found
the
bottle
of
tarret
tonic
port
still
standing
in
the
sideboard
i
gave
it
to
our
servant
explaining
to
her
that
it
would
be
best
mixed
with
water
there
was
still
the
risk
of
her
acquiring
drinking
habits
but
i
could
think
of
no
one
else
to
give
it
to
that
night
eliza
found
the
girl
crying
in
the
kitchen
when
eliza
asked
what
was
the
matter
she
said
that
she
would
rather
say
nothing
but
that
she
was
wishful
to
leave
at
the
end
of
her
month
of
course
eliza
blamed
me
but
i
had
told
the
girl
as
distinctly
as
i
could
speak
that
it
was
a
wine
which
required
dilution
however
eliza
persuaded
her
to
stay
on
the
girl
took
the
pledge
on
the
following
day
and
seemed
changed
in
many
ways
she
put
the
bottle
back
in
the
sideboard
there
was
still
more
than
half
of
it
left
after
that
nothing
happened
with
reference
to
the
tonic
port
until
one
day
i
noticed
that
our
cat
who
had
recently
lost
her
kittens
seemed
in
a
poor
state
of
health
i
gave
it
a
few
spoonfuls
of
the
tonic
port
in
a
little
milk
it
drank
it
with
avidity
somewhat
to
my
surprise
i
had
one
or
two
little
things
to
do
in
the
garden
after
that
and
when
i
came
back
eliza
said
that
the
cat
had
become
so
very
strange
in
its
manner
that
she
had
thought
it
best
to
lock
it
in
the
i
went
to
look
at
it
and
found
it
lying
on
its
back
dead
it
had
a
singularly
happy
expression
on
its
face
both
eliza
and
myself
were
very
sorry
to
lose
it
illustration
had
a
singularly
happy
expression
on
its
i
judged
it
best
to
say
nothing
about
the
port
but
the
bottle
had
gone
from
the
sideboard
eliza
said
that
she
had
removed
it
to
prevent
further
accidents
i
told
the
head
clerk
about
it
but
he
only
laughed
in
the
silliest
way
he
is
a
most
man
in
my
opinion
the
gentleman
of
title
one
of
our
younger
clerks
a
man
of
the
name
of
perkins
is
said
to
be
very
well
connected
he
certainly
spends
more
than
his
salary
and
rarely
wears
the
same
trousers
on
two
consecutive
days
but
i
am
not
a
snob
nor
one
who
thinks
much
of
these
things
and
i
had
never
cultivated
young
perkins
consequently
it
rather
surprised
me
when
he
introduced
me
to
his
friend
the
hon
eugene
clerrimount
then
i
remembered
what
had
been
said
about
perkins
connections
the
hon
eugene
clerrimount
was
a
handsome
young
man
though
apparently
troubled
with
pimples
his
manner
had
in
it
what
i
should
call
dash
there
was
not
an
ounce
of
affectation
about
him
but
then
high
rank
does
not
need
affectations
i
have
always
noticed
that
he
appeared
to
take
rather
a
liking
to
me
and
insisted
that
we
must
all
three
go
out
and
have
a
drink
together
this
is
a
thing
which
i
really
never
do
but
on
this
occasion
i
allowed
myself
to
be
persuaded
not
liking
to
mention
beer
i
said
that
i
would
take
a
glass
of
sherry
wine
nothing
could
have
been
more
friendly
and
pleasing
than
his
behaviour
toward
me
there
was
nothing
at
all
about
him
it
turned
out
that
after
all
the
hon
eugene
clerrimount
had
forgotten
his
purse
and
perkins
happened
to
have
no
money
on
him
i
therefore
paid
for
the
drinks
and
also
lent
the
hon
eugene
clerrimount
half
a
crown
for
his
cab
it
was
indeed
quite
a
pleasure
to
do
so
he
thanked
me
warmly
and
said
that
he
should
like
to
know
me
better
might
he
call
at
my
house
on
the
following
saturday
afternoon
as
luck
would
have
it
i
happened
to
have
a
card
on
me
and
presented
it
to
him
saying
that
it
would
indeed
be
an
honour
thanks
he
replied
and
then
i
can
repay
you
this
or
whatever
it
is
only
four
shillings
i
replied
and
pray
do
not
mention
it
illustration
gentleman
of
eliza
was
certainly
less
pleased
than
myself
when
she
heard
that
the
hon
eugene
clerrimount
was
coming
she
said
that
he
might
be
all
right
or
he
might
not
and
we
did
not
know
anything
about
him
i
replied
one
does
not
know
anything
about
anybody
in
that
rank
of
life
it
is
not
necessary
oh
she
said
is
it
well
i
do
happen
to
be
an
earl
myself
and
really
on
the
saturday
morning
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
get
eliza
to
take
a
little
trouble
with
the
though
i
asked
for
nothing
more
than
a
thorough
dusting
chrysanthemums
and
the
blinds
up
for
the
tea
i
offered
to
make
myself
entirely
responsible
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
girl
should
announce
him
as
the
hon
clerrimount
or
the
hon
eugene
clerrimount
or
hon
clerrimount
she
better
do
all
three
one
after
the
other
said
eliza
snappishly
i
obviated
the
difficulty
by
telling
the
girl
as
she
opened
the
door
merely
to
say
a
gentleman
to
see
you
i
am
rather
one
for
thinking
of
these
little
ways
out
of
difficulties
eliza
wanted
to
know
what
time
he
was
coming
i
replied
that
he
could
not
come
before
three
or
after
six
because
that
would
be
against
etiquette
suppose
he
came
at
five
minutes
to
three
by
accident
said
eliza
would
he
sit
on
our
doorsteps
until
the
clock
struck
and
then
ring
the
bell
i
was
really
beginning
to
lose
patience
with
eliza
however
by
three
i
had
eliza
in
the
with
a
magazine
and
by
her
side
as
if
she
had
been
reading
she
was
really
darning
socks
but
they
could
easily
be
concealed
in
an
empty
art
when
the
front
bell
rang
we
sat
in
the
until
six
but
strangely
enough
the
hon
eugene
clerrimount
never
came
the
trifle
that
i
had
spent
on
the
madeira
cake
and
macaroons
was
nothing
but
it
did
wound
my
feelings
that
he
had
not
even
thought
it
worth
while
to
explain
his
inability
to
keep
his
appointment
and
on
the
monday
i
said
to
perkins
rather
sharply
there
was
that
matter
of
four
shillings
with
your
friend
i
not
received
the
money
and
i
should
thank
you
to
see
about
it
what
said
perkins
you
ask
my
friend
and
me
to
come
and
drink
with
you
and
then
want
me
to
dun
him
for
the
money
to
pay
for
it
well
i
blowed
oh
the
whole
thing
was
most
unsatisfactory
and
incomprehensible
the
hat
i
had
long
believed
that
all
was
not
right
with
my
hat
i
could
prove
nothing
but
i
had
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
that
the
girl
took
liberties
with
it
it
is
very
easy
to
brush
a
silk
hat
the
wrong
way
for
instance
but
silk
hats
do
not
brush
themselves
the
wrong
way
if
it
is
done
some
one
must
have
done
it
morning
after
morning
i
found
marks
on
my
hat
which
i
could
not
account
for
well
i
said
nothing
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
my
eyes
open
it
was
not
only
the
injury
to
the
hat
it
was
the
impertinence
to
myself
that
affected
me
one
saturday
afternoon
while
i
was
at
home
a
costermonger
came
to
the
door
with
walnuts
the
girl
answered
the
bell
and
presently
i
saw
the
coster
and
his
cart
go
past
the
window
i
do
know
why
it
was
or
how
it
was
but
a
suspicion
came
over
me
i
stepped
sharply
to
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
passage
there
was
no
one
there
the
front
door
was
open
and
the
kitchen
door
was
open
and
in
a
position
between
the
two
against
the
was
something
worse
than
ever
i
had
expected
i
picked
that
hat
up
just
as
it
was
with
the
walnuts
inside
it
and
placed
it
on
the
table
then
i
called
to
eliza
to
come
what
is
it
she
asked
as
she
entered
the
i
pointed
to
the
hat
this
kind
of
thing
i
said
has
been
going
on
for
years
oh
do
talk
sense
she
said
what
do
you
mean
sense
i
said
you
ask
me
to
talk
sense
when
i
find
my
own
hat
standing
on
the
floor
in
the
hall
and
used
as
a
a
receptacle
for
walnuts
she
smiled
i
can
explain
all
that
she
said
i
no
doubt
you
can
i
sick
to
death
of
explanations
i
give
ten
or
eleven
shillings
for
a
hat
and
find
it
ruined
i
know
those
explanations
you
told
the
girl
to
buy
the
walnuts
and
she
had
got
nothing
else
to
put
them
in
and
the
hat
was
handy
but
if
you
think
i
take
that
as
an
excuse
you
make
a
mistake
i
was
going
to
say
that
at
all
or
else
you
tell
me
that
you
can
paste
in
a
piece
of
white
paper
so
that
the
stains
on
the
lining
wo
show
explanations
indeed
and
i
was
going
to
say
that
either
i
do
care
what
you
were
going
to
say
i
wo
hear
it
there
no
explanation
possible
for
once
i
mean
to
take
a
strong
line
you
see
that
hat
i
shall
never
wear
it
again
i
know
that
no
one
shall
wear
it
i
do
care
for
the
expense
if
you
choose
to
let
that
ruin
my
hat
then
that
hat
shall
be
ruined
and
no
mistake
about
it
i
picked
the
hat
up
and
gave
it
one
sound
savage
kick
my
foot
went
through
it
and
the
walnuts
flew
all
over
the
room
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
from
the
a
faint
on
the
piano
illustration
picked
the
hat
up
and
gave
it
one
sound
savage
yes
said
eliza
that
the
he
came
at
the
same
time
as
the
and
bought
those
walnuts
and
he
put
them
in
his
hat
hat
mind
you
not
hat
your
hat
hanging
up
in
the
usual
place
you
might
have
seen
it
if
you
looked
only
you
eliza
i
said
you
need
say
no
more
if
that
is
so
the
is
much
less
to
blame
than
i
had
supposed
i
have
to
go
out
now
but
perhaps
you
drop
into
the
and
explain
to
the
tuner
that
there
been
some
slight
misunderstanding
with
his
hat
and
i
say
a
glass
of
beer
and
two
shillings
is
as
much
as
you
need
offer
my
fortune
the
girl
had
just
removed
the
supper
things
we
have
supper
rather
early
because
i
like
a
long
evening
now
eliza
i
said
you
take
your
work
your
sewing
or
whatever
it
may
be
and
i
will
take
my
work
yes
i
brought
it
with
me
and
it
to
be
paid
as
overtime
i
daresay
it
may
seem
much
to
you
a
lot
of
trouble
and
only
a
few
shillings
to
show
for
it
when
all
said
and
done
but
that
is
the
way
fortunes
are
made
by
sticking
at
it
by
plugging
into
it
if
i
may
use
the
term
the
table
clear
if
you
want
to
start
said
eliza
very
well
i
replied
and
fetched
my
black
bag
from
the
passage
to
get
the
accounts
on
which
i
was
working
i
always
hang
the
bag
on
the
peg
in
the
passage
just
under
my
hat
then
it
is
there
in
the
morning
when
and
where
it
is
wanted
method
in
little
things
has
always
been
rather
a
motto
of
mine
it
has
sometimes
struck
me
eliza
i
said
as
i
came
back
into
the
with
the
bag
in
my
hand
that
you
do
not
read
so
much
as
i
should
like
to
see
you
read
well
you
asked
me
to
take
my
work
and
these
socks
are
for
you
and
i
never
know
what
you
do
want
i
did
not
mean
that
i
wanted
you
to
read
at
this
moment
but
there
is
one
book
i
can
not
say
exactly
what
the
title
is
and
the
name
of
the
author
has
slipped
my
memory
which
i
should
like
to
see
in
your
hands
occasionally
because
it
deals
with
the
making
of
fortunes
it
practically
shows
you
how
to
do
it
did
the
man
who
wrote
it
make
one
asked
eliza
that
not
knowing
the
name
of
the
man
i
can
not
say
for
certain
well
i
should
want
to
know
that
first
and
are
you
going
to
start
i
can
hardly
start
until
i
have
unlocked
my
bag
and
i
can
not
unlock
my
bag
until
i
have
the
keys
and
i
can
not
have
the
keys
until
i
have
fetched
them
from
the
bedroom
try
to
be
a
little
more
reasonable
i
could
not
find
the
keys
in
the
bedroom
then
eliza
went
up
and
she
could
not
find
them
either
by
a
sort
of
oversight
they
were
in
my
pocket
all
the
time
i
laughingly
remarked
that
i
knew
i
should
find
them
first
eliza
seemed
rather
pettish
the
joke
being
against
herself
the
reason
why
i
mentioned
that
book
i
said
as
i
unlocked
the
bag
is
because
it
points
out
that
there
are
two
ways
of
making
a
fortune
one
is
if
i
may
say
so
my
own
way
by
method
in
little
things
economy
of
time
doing
all
the
work
that
one
can
get
to
do
and
you
wo
get
much
done
if
you
do
start
soon
said
eliza
i
do
not
like
to
be
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
the
other
way
by
which
you
may
make
a
fortune
well
it
not
making
a
fortune
it
that
the
fortune
makes
you
if
you
understand
me
i
do
said
eliza
i
mean
that
the
fortune
may
come
of
itself
by
luck
luck
is
a
very
curious
thing
we
can
not
understand
it
it
of
no
use
to
talk
about
it
because
it
is
quite
impossible
to
understand
it
then
do
let
talk
about
it
especially
when
you
got
something
else
to
do
temper
temper
eliza
you
must
guard
against
that
i
was
not
going
to
talk
about
luck
i
was
going
to
give
you
an
instance
of
luck
which
happened
to
come
within
my
own
personal
experience
it
is
the
case
of
a
man
of
the
name
of
chumpleigh
in
our
office
and
would
probably
interest
and
amuse
you
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
ever
mentioned
chumpleigh
to
you
yes
you
told
me
all
about
him
several
times
i
might
have
mentioned
chumpleigh
to
eliza
but
i
am
sure
that
i
have
never
told
her
all
about
him
however
i
was
not
going
to
sulk
and
so
i
told
her
the
story
again
the
story
would
not
have
been
so
long
if
she
had
interrupted
me
so
frequently
when
i
had
finished
she
said
that
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
and
i
had
wasted
the
evening
i
owned
that
possibly
i
had
been
chatting
rather
longer
than
i
had
intended
but
i
would
still
get
those
accounts
done
and
sit
up
to
do
them
and
that
means
extra
gas
she
said
that
the
way
money
gets
wasted
there
are
many
men
in
my
place
i
said
who
would
refuse
to
sit
down
to
work
as
late
as
this
i
do
why
on
principle
because
through
the
cultivation
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
i
cultivate
one
arrives
at
fortune
think
what
fortune
would
mean
to
us
big
house
large
garden
servants
carriages
i
should
come
in
from
a
day
with
the
hounds
and
perhaps
say
i
felt
rather
done
up
and
would
like
a
glass
of
champagne
no
question
of
expense
not
a
word
about
it
money
no
object
you
just
get
the
bottle
out
of
the
sideboard
and
i
should
have
my
glass
and
they
finish
it
in
the
kitchen
and
you
going
to
begin
or
are
you
not
asked
eliza
this
minute
i
replied
opening
the
black
bag
i
examined
the
contents
carefully
well
i
said
this
is
a
very
strange
occurrence
indeed
most
unaccountable
i
do
remember
ever
to
have
done
anything
of
the
kind
before
but
i
seem
to
have
forgotten
to
bring
that
work
from
the
city
dear
me
i
shall
be
forgetting
my
head
next
eliza
reply
that
this
would
be
no
great
loss
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
either
funny
or
polite
or
even
true
you
strangely
forget
yourself
i
replied
and
turned
the
gas
out
sharply
shakespeare
i
led
up
to
it
saying
to
eliza
not
at
all
in
a
complaining
way
does
it
not
seem
to
you
a
pity
to
let
these
long
winter
evenings
run
to
waste
yes
dear
she
replied
i
think
you
ought
to
do
something
and
you
too
is
it
not
so
darling
there
generally
some
sewing
or
the
accounts
yes
but
these
things
do
not
exercise
the
mind
accounts
do
not
in
the
way
i
mean
i
had
now
reached
my
point
how
would
it
be
if
i
were
to
read
aloud
to
you
i
do
think
you
have
ever
heard
me
read
aloud
you
are
fond
of
the
theatre
and
we
can
not
often
afford
to
go
this
would
make
up
for
it
there
are
many
men
who
would
tell
you
that
they
would
sooner
have
a
play
read
aloud
to
them
than
see
it
acted
in
the
finest
theatre
in
the
world
would
they
well
perhaps
if
i
were
only
sewing
it
would
interrupt
me
much
i
said
that
is
not
very
graciously
put
eliza
there
is
a
certain
art
in
reading
aloud
some
have
it
and
some
have
not
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
ever
told
you
but
when
i
was
a
boy
of
twelve
i
won
a
prize
for
recitation
though
several
older
boys
were
competing
against
me
she
said
that
i
had
told
her
before
several
times
i
continued
and
i
suppose
that
i
have
developed
since
then
a
man
in
our
office
once
told
me
that
he
thought
i
should
have
done
well
on
the
stage
i
do
know
whether
i
ever
mentioned
it
she
said
that
i
had
mentioned
it
once
or
twice
i
should
have
thought
that
you
would
have
been
glad
of
a
little
pleasure
innocent
profitable
and
entertaining
however
if
you
think
i
am
not
capable
of
what
do
you
want
to
read
what
would
you
like
me
to
read
miss
sakers
lent
me
this
she
handed
me
a
volume
entitled
the
murglow
mystery
or
the
stain
on
the
staircase
trash
like
this
is
not
literature
i
said
however
to
please
her
i
glanced
at
the
first
page
half
an
hour
later
i
said
that
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
read
a
book
of
that
stamp
out
loud
then
why
do
you
go
on
reading
it
to
yourself
strictly
speaking
i
am
not
reading
it
i
am
glancing
at
it
when
eliza
got
up
to
go
to
bed
an
hour
afterward
she
asked
me
if
i
was
still
glancing
i
kept
my
temper
try
not
to
be
so
infernally
unreasonable
i
said
if
miss
sakers
lends
us
a
book
it
is
discourteous
not
to
look
at
it
on
the
following
night
eliza
said
that
she
hoped
i
was
not
going
to
sit
up
until
three
in
the
morning
wasting
the
gas
and
ruining
my
health
over
a
book
that
i
myself
had
said
and
who
pays
for
the
gas
nobody
paid
last
quarter
yet
mother
ca
do
everything
and
well
we
can
talk
about
that
some
other
time
i
am
going
to
read
aloud
to
you
a
play
of
shakespeare
i
wonder
if
you
even
know
who
shakespeare
was
of
course
i
do
could
you
honestly
say
that
you
have
ever
read
one
only
one
of
his
tragedies
no
could
you
i
am
going
to
read
to
you
trying
to
indicate
by
changes
in
my
voice
which
character
is
speaking
i
opened
the
book
eliza
said
that
she
could
think
who
it
was
took
her
scissors
i
ca
begin
till
you
keep
quiet
i
said
it
the
second
pair
that
gone
this
week
very
well
then
i
said
shutting
up
the
book
with
a
bang
i
will
not
read
aloud
to
you
at
all
you
may
get
along
as
you
can
without
it
you
sure
you
did
take
those
scissors
for
anything
she
replied
meditatively
now
then
i
said
on
the
next
night
i
am
ready
to
begin
the
tragedy
is
entitled
this
is
the
first
scene
what
is
the
first
scene
a
blasted
heath
well
i
think
you
might
give
a
civil
answer
to
a
civil
question
there
was
no
occasion
to
use
that
word
i
did
you
did
i
heard
it
distinctly
do
let
me
explain
it
shakespeare
uses
the
word
i
was
only
quoting
it
it
merely
means
oh
if
it
shakespeare
i
suppose
it
all
right
nobody
seems
to
mind
what
says
you
can
go
on
i
read
for
some
time
eliza
in
reply
to
my
question
owned
that
she
had
enjoyed
it
but
she
went
to
bed
before
her
usual
time
when
i
was
preparing
to
read
aloud
on
the
following
evening
i
was
unable
to
find
our
copy
of
shakespeare
this
was
very
annoying
as
it
had
been
a
eliza
said
that
she
had
found
her
scissors
and
very
likely
i
should
find
the
shakespeare
some
other
night
but
i
never
did
i
have
half
thought
of
buying
another
copy
or
i
dare
say
eliza
mother
would
like
to
give
us
it
eliza
thinks
not
the
unsolved
problem
eliza
i
said
one
evening
do
you
think
that
you
are
fonder
of
me
than
i
am
of
you
or
that
i
am
fonder
of
you
than
you
are
of
me
she
answered
what
is
thirteen
from
without
looking
up
from
the
i
do
think
i
said
that
when
i
speak
to
you
you
might
have
the
civility
to
pay
some
little
attention
she
replied
one
pound
fifteen
and
two
and
i
hope
you
know
where
we
are
to
get
it
from
for
i
do
and
do
bang
on
the
table
in
that
silly
way
or
you
spill
the
ink
i
did
not
bang
i
tapped
slightly
from
a
pardonable
impatience
i
put
a
plain
question
to
you
some
time
ago
and
i
should
like
a
plain
answer
to
it
well
what
do
you
want
to
talk
for
when
you
see
i
am
counting
now
what
is
it
what
i
asked
was
this
do
i
think
i
mean
do
you
think
that
i
am
fonder
of
me
no
you
are
fonder
of
i
well
i
begin
again
which
of
us
two
would
you
say
was
fonder
of
the
other
than
the
other
was
of
the
dash
it
all
you
know
what
i
mean
no
i
do
but
it
nothing
to
swear
about
i
was
not
swearing
if
you
do
know
what
i
mean
i
try
to
put
it
more
simply
are
you
fonder
than
i
am
there
fonder
of
what
fonder
of
each
other
you
mean
is
each
of
us
fonder
of
the
other
than
the
other
is
of
of
the
each
i
mean
nothing
of
the
kind
until
you
muddled
it
the
thing
was
perfectly
clear
well
we
two
are
two
are
we
not
of
course
i
know
that
but
wait
a
minute
i
intend
that
you
shall
understand
me
this
time
which
of
those
two
would
you
say
was
fonder
of
the
other
than
the
other
was
of
the
other
or
would
you
say
that
each
was
as
fond
of
the
other
as
the
other
one
was
now
you
see
it
almost
say
it
again
would
you
say
that
in
your
opinion
neither
of
us
were
fonder
of
the
other
than
both
were
of
each
or
that
one
was
fonder
of
the
other
than
the
other
was
of
the
first
and
if
so
which
now
you
made
it
worse
than
ever
i
do
believe
you
know
what
you
mean
yourself
do
come
to
supper
and
talk
sense
i
smiled
cynically
as
i
sat
down
to
supper
this
does
surprise
me
in
the
least
i
remarked
i
never
yet
knew
a
woman
who
could
argue
or
even
understand
the
first
step
in
an
argument
and
i
do
suppose
i
ever
shall
well
said
eliza
you
ca
argue
until
you
know
what
you
are
talking
about
and
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
and
you
do
seem
to
know
yourself
or
if
you
do
you
too
muddled
to
tell
anybody
if
you
want
to
argue
argue
about
one
pound
fifteen
and
two
it
griffiths
and
been
sent
in
three
times
already
do
shirk
it
eliza
do
try
to
get
away
from
it
i
asked
you
which
of
us
you
thought
was
the
fonder
of
the
other
and
you
understand
it
why
of
course
i
understand
why
did
you
say
so
before
as
far
as
i
remember
those
were
my
precise
words
but
they
were
what
you
said
was
neither
of
us
was
fonder
of
both
than
each
is
of
either
which
of
the
two
would
it
be
or
something
of
the
kind
now
how
could
i
talk
such
absolute
nonsense
ah
she
said
when
men
lose
their
temper
they
never
know
what
they
saying
i
had
a
very
good
answer
to
that
but
just
at
the
moment
the
girl
brought
in
the
last
post
there
was
a
letter
from
eliza
mother
there
was
also
an
enclosure
in
postal
orders
quite
beyond
anything
i
had
expected
and
she
expressed
a
hope
that
they
might
enable
us
to
defray
some
of
the
expenses
incidental
to
the
season
as
far
as
my
own
personal
feeling
is
concerned
i
should
have
returned
them
at
once
in
some
ways
i
daresay
that
i
am
a
proud
man
i
have
been
told
so
but
the
poor
old
lady
takes
such
pleasure
in
giving
and
she
has
so
little
other
enjoyment
that
i
should
have
been
reluctant
to
check
her
in
fact
taking
the
money
as
evidence
of
her
affection
i
was
pleased
so
was
eliza
pay
griffiths
account
i
said
and
tell
him
that
he
has
lost
our
patronage
for
ever
we
did
not
recur
to
the
original
question
personally
i
should
say
that
in
the
case
of
two
people
it
might
very
well
happen
that
though
at
one
time
the
affection
of
one
for
the
other
might
be
greater
than
the
affection
which
the
other
had
for
the
one
which
i
originally
mentioned
at
the
same
time
yet
at
some
other
time
the
affection
which
the
other
one
had
for
the
other
might
be
just
as
much
greater
than
the
affection
which
the
first
one
had
for
the
second
as
the
difference
was
in
the
first
instance
between
the
two
at
least
that
is
the
general
drift
of
what
i
mean
eliza
would
never
see
it
of
course
the
day
off
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
our
junior
partner
to
ethel
mary
only
surviving
daughter
of
william
hubblestead
of
banlingbury
by
the
canon
of
blockminster
assisted
by
the
rev
eugene
hubblestead
cousin
of
the
bride
on
this
occasion
the
office
was
closed
for
the
whole
of
one
day
and
the
staff
had
a
holiday
without
deduction
of
salary
the
staff
had
presented
six
silver
hallmarked
nutcrackers
and
a
handsomely
bound
volume
of
cowper
poetical
works
the
latter
was
my
own
suggestion
there
was
a
sum
of
eight
shillings
over
after
the
purchase
of
the
nutcrackers
and
i
have
always
had
a
partiality
for
cowper
the
junior
partner
thanked
us
personally
and
in
very
warm
terms
at
the
same
time
he
announced
that
the
following
thursday
was
to
be
treated
as
a
holiday
the
weather
was
glorious
and
i
have
never
had
a
more
enjoyable
day
the
girl
laid
breakfast
overnight
and
we
rose
at
five
by
six
eliza
had
cut
some
mutton
sandwiches
and
placed
them
in
a
basket
with
a
bottle
of
milk
the
milkman
having
obliged
with
a
specially
early
call
by
appointment
a
brief
journey
by
train
and
by
a
seven
we
were
at
danstow
for
our
day
off
in
the
country
danstow
is
a
picturesque
little
village
and
looked
beautiful
in
the
hot
sunlight
i
was
wearing
a
fairly
new
summer
suit
with
brown
boots
as
i
remarked
to
eliza
it
would
probably
have
created
a
feeling
of
surprise
among
the
villagers
if
they
had
learned
that
as
a
rule
my
professional
duties
took
me
to
the
city
in
the
morning
eliza
said
all
right
what
do
we
do
here
why
i
said
there
the
old
church
we
must
miss
that
we
went
and
examined
the
old
church
then
we
went
twice
up
and
down
the
village
street
and
examined
that
well
said
eliza
what
next
now
i
replied
we
just
stroll
about
and
amuse
ourselves
i
feel
particularly
that
breakfasting
at
six
that
is
said
eliza
if
you
could
find
a
quiet
place
we
might
have
a
sandwich
we
went
a
little
way
along
the
road
and
i
espied
a
field
which
seemed
to
me
to
look
likely
i
said
to
a
i
am
a
stranger
here
can
you
tell
me
whether
there
would
be
any
objection
to
our
sitting
in
that
field
he
said
in
rather
an
offensive
and
sarcastic
way
that
he
believed
the
field
was
open
for
sitting
in
about
that
hour
i
did
not
give
him
any
reply
but
just
opened
the
gate
for
eliza
we
sat
down
under
the
hedge
and
finished
our
sandwiches
and
milk
the
church
clock
struck
nine
what
train
do
we
go
back
by
asked
eliza
not
until
nine
there
a
day
for
you
twelve
hours
and
a
half
said
eliza
and
we
done
the
sandwiches
and
done
the
milk
and
done
the
church
and
there
nothing
else
to
do
except
amuse
ourselves
i
added
as
i
took
off
my
boots
which
had
pained
me
slightly
i
then
dozed
off
eliza
woke
me
to
say
that
she
had
read
all
the
newspaper
the
sandwiches
were
wrapped
in
and
picked
some
wild
flowers
and
the
flowers
had
died
and
she
wanted
to
know
what
the
time
was
it
was
just
past
eleven
she
said
oh
lor
i
soon
dropped
off
again
when
i
woke
at
twelve
eliza
was
not
there
she
returned
in
a
few
minutes
and
said
that
she
had
been
doing
the
church
over
again
that
was
hardly
necessary
i
observed
oh
one
must
do
something
and
there
nothing
else
to
do
on
the
contrary
there
luncheon
we
have
that
at
once
so
as
to
give
us
a
good
long
afternoon
the
afternoon
will
be
long
enough
she
said
if
i
had
not
known
that
she
was
having
a
day
enjoyment
i
should
have
thought
that
she
seemed
rather
dejected
in
her
manner
the
luncheon
at
the
village
inn
was
not
expensive
eliza
said
that
their
idea
of
chops
was
not
her
idea
but
all
the
same
she
seemed
inclined
to
spin
the
thing
out
and
make
it
last
as
long
as
possible
i
deprecated
this
as
i
felt
that
i
could
not
very
well
take
my
boots
off
again
until
i
had
returned
to
the
field
very
well
then
she
said
only
let
go
back
slowly
as
slowly
as
you
like
i
replied
it
the
right
boot
principally
but
i
prefer
to
walk
slowly
when
we
had
resumed
our
old
position
under
the
hedge
and
i
had
removed
my
boots
i
said
now
then
i
think
i
earned
a
pipe
and
a
short
nap
you
amuse
yourself
in
any
way
you
like
do
with
myself
she
asked
rather
sharply
she
walked
twice
round
the
field
and
then
i
fell
off
to
sleep
it
turned
out
afterward
that
she
also
did
the
picturesque
old
church
for
the
third
time
and
went
over
a
house
which
was
to
let
refusing
to
take
it
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
this
was
rather
dishonest
as
she
would
not
have
taken
it
if
there
had
been
a
or
even
two
i
would
not
do
that
kind
of
thing
myself
i
awoke
about
the
charge
for
tea
at
the
inn
was
very
moderate
though
eliza
said
that
there
was
tea
which
was
tea
and
tea
which
was
an
insult
eliza
found
that
there
was
a
train
back
at
six
and
said
she
was
going
by
it
whether
i
did
or
not
because
it
was
a
pity
to
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
and
she
had
the
face
to
ask
for
the
keys
of
that
church
again
i
accompanied
her
i
fancy
that
the
brown
leather
is
liable
to
shrink
in
the
sun
and
i
was
not
unwilling
to
get
back
to
my
slippers
and
stretch
myself
out
on
the
sofa
there
is
nothing
like
a
long
day
in
the
country
quite
apart
from
the
enjoyment
you
feel
that
it
is
doing
you
so
much
good
i
am
sorry
that
eliza
did
not
seem
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
more
the
mushroom
we
were
at
breakfast
one
morning
in
the
summer
when
the
girl
entered
rather
excitedly
and
said
that
to
the
best
of
her
belief
there
was
a
mushroom
coming
in
the
little
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
it
seemed
a
most
extraordinary
thing
and
eliza
and
i
both
went
out
to
look
at
it
there
was
certainly
something
white
coming
through
the
turf
the
only
question
was
whether
or
not
it
was
a
mushroom
the
girl
seemed
certain
about
it
why
she
said
in
my
last
place
mushrooms
was
frequent
you
see
being
wealthy
they
had
anything
they
fancied
if
i
know
about
mushrooms
i
ought
to
there
is
a
familiarity
in
that
girl
manner
which
to
my
mind
is
highly
objectionable
the
establishment
where
she
was
formerly
employed
was
apparently
on
a
scale
that
we
do
not
attempt
that
does
not
justify
her
however
in
continually
drawing
comparisons
i
shall
certainly
have
something
to
say
to
her
about
it
however
it
was
not
about
jane
that
i
intended
to
speak
but
about
the
mushroom
eliza
said
that
i
ought
to
put
a
flowerpot
over
the
mushroom
because
being
visible
from
the
road
some
one
might
be
tempted
to
come
in
and
steal
it
but
i
was
too
deep
for
that
no
i
replied
if
you
put
an
inverted
there
everybody
will
guess
that
you
are
hiding
a
mushroom
underneath
it
just
put
a
scrap
of
newspaper
over
it
but
that
might
get
blown
away
fasten
down
one
corner
of
it
with
a
hairpin
eliza
said
that
i
was
certainly
one
to
think
of
things
i
believe
there
is
truth
in
that
on
my
way
to
the
station
i
happened
to
meet
bungwall
gardener
a
most
obliging
and
respectful
man
and
had
a
word
with
him
about
the
mushroom
he
said
that
he
would
come
round
in
the
evening
and
have
a
look
at
it
i
was
pleased
to
find
on
my
return
that
the
mushroom
was
still
in
the
garden
under
the
newspaper
and
had
increased
slightly
in
size
this
i
said
to
eliza
is
very
satisfactory
it
would
make
a
nice
little
present
to
send
to
mother
eliza
observed
there
i
could
not
entirely
agree
with
her
i
pointed
out
that
in
a
week
time
i
should
probably
be
applying
to
her
mother
for
a
small
temporary
loan
i
did
not
think
it
an
honourable
thing
to
attempt
to
influence
her
mind
beforehand
by
sending
a
present
i
wished
her
to
approach
the
question
of
the
loan
purely
in
a
business
spirit
i
added
that
i
thought
we
would
leave
the
mushroom
to
grow
for
one
more
day
and
then
have
it
for
breakfast
that
ultimately
was
decided
upon
then
bungwall
gardener
arrived
and
said
that
he
was
sorry
to
disappoint
us
in
any
way
and
it
was
not
his
fault
but
the
mushroom
was
a
toadstool
this
i
said
to
eliza
is
something
of
a
blow
perhaps
she
said
bungwall
gardener
is
mistaken
i
fear
not
but
however
i
happened
to
mention
about
that
mushroom
to
our
head
clerk
this
morning
and
he
said
that
he
thoroughly
understood
mushrooms
and
had
made
a
small
profit
by
growing
them
morning
i
will
pick
that
toadstool
or
mushroom
as
the
case
may
be
take
it
up
to
the
city
and
ask
him
about
it
eliza
agreed
that
this
would
be
the
best
way
but
at
breakfast
next
morning
she
seemed
thoughtful
and
somewhat
depressed
i
asked
her
what
she
was
thinking
about
it
like
this
she
said
if
your
head
clerk
says
that
our
toadstool
is
a
mushroom
while
bungwall
gardener
says
that
our
mushroom
is
a
toadstool
we
like
to
eat
it
because
of
gardener
and
we
like
to
throw
it
away
because
of
your
head
clerk
and
i
do
see
what
to
do
with
it
you
forget
my
dear
we
have
a
third
opinion
jane
says
the
mushroom
is
a
mushroom
jane
will
say
anything
well
we
might
put
her
to
the
test
we
might
ask
her
if
she
like
to
eat
the
mushroom
herself
and
then
if
she
says
yes
and
seems
pleased
why
of
course
we
eat
it
i
go
and
pick
it
now
and
when
i
went
to
do
so
i
found
that
the
mushroom
had
gone
eliza
says
that
bungwall
gardener
told
us
it
was
a
toadstool
to
keep
us
from
picking
it
and
then
stole
it
himself
because
he
knew
that
it
was
a
mushroom
that
may
be
i
should
be
sorry
to
believe
it
because
i
have
always
found
bungwall
gardener
such
a
very
respectful
man
to
my
mind
there
is
an
air
of
mystery
over
the
whole
affair
the
pleasant
surprise
i
had
got
the
money
by
work
done
at
home
out
of
office
hours
it
came
to
four
pounds
altogether
at
first
i
thought
i
would
use
it
to
discharge
a
part
of
our
debt
to
eliza
mother
but
it
was
very
possible
that
she
would
send
it
back
again
in
which
case
the
pence
spent
on
the
postal
orders
would
be
wasted
and
i
am
not
a
man
that
wastes
pennies
also
it
was
not
absolutely
certain
that
she
would
send
it
back
i
sent
her
a
long
letter
instead
my
long
letters
are
almost
her
only
intellectual
pleasure
as
for
the
four
pounds
i
reserved
two
for
myself
for
any
incidental
expenses
and
decided
to
give
two
to
eliza
i
did
not
mean
simply
to
hand
them
to
her
but
to
get
up
something
in
the
way
of
a
pleasant
surprise
i
had
tried
something
of
the
kind
before
eliza
once
asked
me
for
six
shillings
for
a
new
that
she
had
seen
i
went
and
stood
behind
her
chair
and
said
no
dear
i
could
think
of
it
at
the
same
time
dropping
the
six
shillings
down
the
back
of
her
neck
eliza
said
it
was
a
pity
i
could
give
her
six
shillings
for
a
without
compelling
her
to
go
and
undress
at
nine
in
the
morning
it
was
not
a
success
however
i
had
more
than
one
idea
in
my
head
this
time
i
thought
i
would
first
find
out
if
there
was
anything
she
wanted
so
on
sunday
at
i
said
not
as
if
i
were
meaning
anything
in
particular
is
there
anything
you
want
eliza
yes
she
said
i
want
a
general
who
go
to
bed
at
nine
and
get
up
at
five
if
they
only
do
that
that
all
i
ask
you
will
pardon
me
eliza
i
said
but
you
are
not
speaking
correctly
you
said
that
was
all
that
you
asked
what
you
meant
do
you
know
what
i
meant
i
flatter
myself
that
i
know
precisely
then
if
you
know
precisely
what
i
meant
i
must
have
spoken
accurately
but
as
we
went
to
church
i
discovered
that
she
wanted
a
new
jacket
her
own
was
trimmed
rabbit
and
had
been
good
but
the
fur
had
gone
bald
in
places
next
morning
i
wrote
on
a
sheet
of
to
buy
a
new
jacket
with
your
husband
love
i
folded
the
two
sovereigns
up
in
this
and
dropped
the
packet
into
the
pocket
of
eliza
old
jacket
as
it
hung
in
the
wardrobe
not
telling
her
what
i
had
done
my
idea
was
that
she
would
put
on
the
jacket
to
go
out
shopping
in
the
morning
and
putting
her
hand
in
the
pocket
get
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
was
leaving
for
town
she
asked
me
why
i
kept
on
smiling
so
mysteriously
i
replied
perhaps
you
too
will
smile
before
the
day
is
over
on
my
return
i
found
eliza
at
the
front
door
come
and
look
she
said
cheerfully
i
have
got
a
pleasant
surprise
for
you
she
flung
open
the
door
and
pointed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
stood
a
a
most
handsome
and
graceful
plant
it
stood
in
one
of
the
best
saucers
with
some
coloured
paper
round
the
pot
and
the
general
effect
was
very
good
i
at
once
guessed
that
she
had
bought
it
for
me
with
the
change
from
my
present
to
her
and
thought
it
showed
very
good
feeling
in
her
i
hope
you
have
not
given
too
much
for
this
i
said
i
did
give
any
money
for
it
i
do
understand
well
you
must
know
i
had
a
present
this
morning
of
course
i
know
did
mother
tell
you
yes
she
has
sent
me
a
beautiful
new
jacket
then
a
man
came
round
with
a
barrow
of
plants
and
he
said
he
did
want
money
if
i
had
any
clothes
to
spare
so
i
gave
him
my
old
jacket
for
this
and
i
remembered
that
i
had
seen
the
man
with
the
barrow
farther
down
the
street
excuse
me
for
one
moment
eliza
i
said
and
dashed
out
after
him
he
was
a
big
man
and
he
made
no
difficulty
about
it
at
all
yes
he
said
i
bought
that
jacket
and
i
do
deny
it
there
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
my
bundle
and
i
ai
even
looked
at
it
since
nor
i
ai
goin
to
look
now
you
say
there
was
two
suvreigns
in
the
pocket
a
gent
like
you
do
want
to
swindle
a
common
man
like
me
if
you
say
the
two
suvreigns
was
there
then
they
there
now
and
i
can
return
yer
two
pound
out
o
my
own
in
a
suttunty
of
gettin
back
out
o
the
jacket
pocket
bless
yer
i
knows
an
honest
man
when
i
sees
one
with
these
words
he
drew
the
money
from
his
own
waistcoat
pocket
and
handed
it
to
me
i
took
it
with
some
reluctance
had
you
better
make
quite
certain
not
a
bit
says
he
if
them
suvreigns
were
there
when
the
jacket
were
to
me
they
is
there
now
i
could
see
as
you
was
a
man
to
be
trusted
otherwise
i
undone
the
bundle
and
searched
long
afore
this
what
have
you
been
doing
said
eliza
on
my
return
never
mind
your
mother
has
given
you
a
new
jacket
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
giving
you
a
new
hat
i
pressed
the
two
coins
into
her
palm
she
looked
at
them
and
said
you
ca
get
a
hat
for
a
halfpenny
you
know
dear
what
did
you
rush
out
for
just
now
and
why
did
you
have
these
two
farthings
gilded
you
be
mistaking
them
for
sovereigns
if
you
not
careful
were
you
trying
to
take
me
in
i
did
not
quite
see
what
to
say
for
the
moment
and
so
i
took
her
suggestion
i
explained
that
it
was
a
joke
you
do
look
much
as
if
you
were
joking
but
i
was
i
suppose
i
ought
to
know
if
any
man
does
however
eliza
if
you
want
a
new
hat
anything
up
to
half
a
sovereign
you
only
to
say
it
she
said
it
thanked
me
and
asked
me
to
come
and
help
her
water
the
it
such
a
shapely
she
said
yes
i
answered
sadly
it
a
regular
plant
and
so
it
was
though
i
had
not
been
intending
what
the
french
call
a
at
the
time
the
mopworths
i
must
say
that
both
eliza
and
myself
felt
a
good
deal
of
contempt
for
the
mopworths
we
had
known
them
for
three
years
and
that
gave
us
a
claim
peter
mopworth
was
a
connection
of
eliza
by
marriage
and
that
also
gave
us
a
claim
further
our
social
position
gave
us
a
claim
nevertheless
the
mopworths
were
to
have
their
annual
party
on
the
following
wednesday
and
they
had
not
invited
us
upon
my
soul
i
exclaimed
i
never
in
my
life
heard
of
anything
so
absolutely
paltry
i
ca
think
why
it
is
said
eliza
oh
we
not
good
enough
for
them
we
all
know
who
his
father
was
and
we
all
know
what
he
is
a
petty
provincial
shopkeeper
a
gentleman
holding
important
employment
in
one
of
the
principal
mercantile
firms
in
the
city
is
good
enough
for
him
if
i
permitted
to
clean
his
boots
i
sure
i
ought
to
be
thankful
oh
yes
of
course
no
doubt
you
do
get
so
sarcastic
observed
eliza
that
nothing
nothing
to
what
i
should
be
if
i
let
myself
go
but
i
do
choose
to
let
myself
go
i
do
think
he
worth
it
and
i
think
she
worth
it
either
it
a
pity
perhaps
that
they
do
know
that
they
making
themselves
ridiculous
but
it
ca
be
helped
personally
i
give
the
thing
another
thought
that
the
best
thing
to
do
said
eliza
of
course
it
is
why
trouble
one
head
about
people
of
that
class
and
i
say
eliza
if
you
meet
that
mopworth
woman
in
the
street
there
no
occasion
for
you
to
recognize
her
that
would
look
as
if
we
were
terribly
cut
up
because
we
had
been
asked
to
their
party
possibly
whereas
i
do
even
consider
it
worth
talking
about
we
discussed
the
mopworths
and
their
party
for
another
hour
and
a
half
and
then
went
to
bed
lying
awake
last
night
i
said
at
breakfast
next
morning
i
help
thinking
over
the
different
things
we
have
done
for
those
serpents
what
serpents
those
contemptible
mopworths
i
wonder
if
they
have
any
feelings
of
shame
if
they
have
they
must
blush
when
they
think
of
the
way
they
have
treated
us
i
ca
think
why
they
left
us
out
perhaps
it
a
mistake
not
a
bit
of
it
i
been
expecting
this
for
some
time
of
course
he
has
made
money
i
do
say
i
would
rather
say
how
he
has
made
it
but
it
seems
to
have
turned
his
head
however
after
this
i
shall
probably
never
mention
him
again
eliza
began
to
talk
about
the
weather
i
told
her
that
mopworth
had
done
things
which
personally
i
should
have
been
very
sorry
to
do
and
that
i
should
be
reluctant
to
adopt
his
loud
style
of
dress
but
of
course
i
added
no
gentleman
ever
does
dress
like
that
eliza
said
that
if
i
intended
to
catch
my
train
i
had
better
start
i
started
on
my
return
i
said
to
eliza
that
though
the
whole
subject
was
distasteful
to
me
there
was
one
point
to
which
i
had
given
a
few
moments
consideration
reluctant
though
i
was
to
sully
my
lips
with
the
name
of
mopworth
i
felt
it
a
duty
to
myself
to
say
that
even
if
the
mopworths
had
asked
us
to
their
annual
party
i
should
have
refused
really
said
eliza
this
annoyed
me
slightly
she
ought
to
have
seen
without
being
told
that
it
was
impossible
for
people
like
us
to
continue
to
know
people
like
them
i
am
accustomed
i
replied
to
say
just
exactly
what
i
mean
as
far
as
i
can
remember
i
have
lately
more
than
once
asked
you
to
drop
the
mopworths
if
i
have
not
actually
done
it
it
has
been
in
my
mind
to
do
so
they
are
connected
to
us
by
marriage
and
i
am
not
unduly
proud
but
still
i
feel
that
we
must
draw
the
line
somewhere
i
do
not
care
to
have
mopworth
bragging
about
the
place
that
he
is
on
intimate
terms
with
us
well
said
eliza
there
are
such
a
lot
of
people
who
ever
ask
us
to
anything
miss
sakers
is
friendly
of
course
especially
when
there
are
subscriptions
on
for
the
bazaar
or
the
new
organ
but
she
carry
it
to
that
point
quite
so
i
said
and
i
by
no
means
certain
about
miss
sakers
she
may
be
all
right
i
hope
she
is
but
i
candidly
confess
that
i
by
no
means
like
her
manner
at
this
moment
the
girl
brought
in
a
note
delivered
by
hand
from
mopworth
it
said
that
she
had
sent
an
invitation
to
eliza
but
had
had
no
reply
she
felt
so
certain
that
the
invitation
must
have
been
delayed
in
the
post
which
was
not
surprising
considering
the
season
that
she
had
ventured
to
write
again
though
it
might
be
against
etiquette
she
hoped
that
we
should
both
be
able
to
come
and
said
that
on
the
previous
occasion
i
had
been
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
well
i
said
eliza
what
would
you
like
to
do
oh
i
going
she
replied
then
if
you
insist
i
shall
go
with
you
i
never
had
a
word
to
say
against
mopworth
it
is
true
that
is
not
in
every
particular
what
well
what
i
should
care
to
be
myself
possibly
he
has
not
had
my
advantages
i
do
not
want
to
judge
him
too
harshly
my
dress
clothes
are
put
away
with
my
summer
suit
in
the
second
drawer
in
the
just
put
them
to
the
fire
to
get
the
creases
out
and
eliza
write
a
friendly
note
to
mopworth
implying
that
we
had
never
heard
of
the
party
i
saw
from
the
first
that
the
omission
was
a
mistake
eliza
went
away
smiling
women
are
so
variable
the
eliza
always
works
me
some
little
pretty
trifle
for
my
birthday
and
always
has
done
so
since
the
day
when
i
led
her
to
the
hymeneal
altar
but
it
is
not
done
at
all
as
a
matter
of
course
during
the
days
before
my
birthday
when
she
is
working
at
the
present
she
keeps
a
clean
handkerchief
by
her
side
and
flings
it
over
the
work
to
hide
it
when
i
enter
the
room
this
makes
it
more
of
a
surprise
when
the
day
comes
as
a
rule
i
whistle
a
few
bars
in
a
careless
way
before
entering
the
room
so
as
to
give
her
plenty
of
time
to
get
the
work
under
the
handkerchief
there
is
no
definite
arrangement
about
this
i
merely
do
what
good
taste
dictates
last
year
instead
of
the
handkerchief
she
kept
a
large
by
her
side
when
she
was
working
however
though
i
did
not
tell
her
so
this
let
the
secret
out
i
knew
that
she
must
be
doing
me
a
pair
of
slippers
this
year
on
my
birthday
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
i
found
placed
before
me
the
plate
with
the
tin
cover
to
it
a
very
useful
article
when
there
happens
to
be
an
invalid
in
the
house
eliza
bending
down
behind
the
to
hide
her
smile
told
me
to
be
quick
with
my
breakfast
in
rather
a
censorious
voice
i
lifted
the
tin
cover
and
there
on
the
plate
was
the
which
eliza
had
made
for
me
this
rather
graceful
and
amusing
way
of
giving
a
present
is
not
really
eliza
own
invention
i
did
it
some
years
ago
when
i
gave
her
a
pincushion
as
the
pincushion
was
made
to
imitate
a
poached
egg
and
really
very
like
perhaps
the
humour
in
that
instance
had
rather
more
point
however
i
do
not
say
this
at
all
to
find
fault
with
eliza
i
am
rather
one
to
think
of
novelties
and
if
eliza
cares
to
copy
any
of
them
so
much
the
better
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
which
eliza
had
made
for
me
were
of
black
velvet
which
always
has
a
handsome
look
to
my
mind
on
the
top
was
worked
in
gold
beads
kindly
clean
the
pen
the
interior
was
composed
of
several
folds
of
very
pale
shades
of
art
muslin
only
the
day
before
howlett
bast
had
refused
to
send
any
more
patterns
as
the
last
lot
sent
had
not
been
returned
though
twice
applied
for
i
understood
that
now
however
it
made
a
very
good
in
pleasant
simple
taste
and
i
thanked
eliza
for
it
several
times
most
warmly
at
my
suggestion
it
was
placed
on
the
in
the
one
never
wrote
there
but
it
seemed
naturally
to
belong
to
the
so
far
my
birthday
had
gone
happily
enough
in
the
evening
when
i
returned
from
the
city
i
sat
down
to
write
a
short
sharp
note
to
howlett
bast
i
explained
to
them
that
by
their
impertinence
they
were
running
a
grave
risk
of
entirely
losing
my
custom
and
suggested
to
them
that
the
lot
of
patterns
to
which
they
referred
might
very
possibly
have
been
lost
in
the
post
when
i
had
finished
the
letter
i
wiped
my
pen
on
the
inside
of
my
coat
this
is
my
general
custom
some
men
wipe
their
pens
on
their
hair
not
a
very
cleanly
habit
in
my
opinion
besides
unless
the
colour
of
the
hair
is
exceptionally
dark
the
ink
shows
i
had
no
sooner
wiped
my
pen
on
the
inside
of
my
coat
than
i
remembered
eliza
present
determined
to
show
her
that
i
appreciated
it
i
took
a
full
dip
of
ink
stepped
into
the
and
wiped
the
pen
on
the
new
then
i
called
eliza
i
have
just
found
your
present
very
useful
would
you
like
to
come
and
look
she
happened
to
be
fastening
something
up
the
back
at
the
time
but
she
came
down
a
minute
afterward
she
picked
up
the
looked
at
it
exclaimed
ruined
and
then
walked
rapidly
out
of
the
room
i
followed
her
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
it
appeared
that
the
words
kindly
clean
the
pen
meant
that
the
pen
was
to
be
cleaned
on
a
scrap
of
paper
before
the
was
used
eliza
said
that
i
might
have
known
that
the
pretty
muslin
was
not
intended
to
be
a
perfect
mess
of
ink
well
i
said
i
did
know
that
all
there
is
to
say
about
it
but
it
was
not
apparently
all
that
there
was
to
say
about
it
in
fact
the
whole
thing
cast
an
unpleasant
shade
over
the
evening
of
my
birthday
finally
i
took
a
strong
line
and
refused
to
speak
at
all
the
in
the
course
of
conversation
on
saturday
evening
it
had
transpired
that
eliza
had
never
been
in
paul
cathedral
then
i
said
you
shall
go
there
morning
i
will
take
you
i
sure
i
agreeable
said
eliza
on
the
sunday
morning
one
or
two
little
things
had
happened
to
put
me
out
at
breakfast
i
had
occasion
to
say
that
the
eggs
were
and
eliza
contradicted
me
it
was
very
absurd
of
her
as
i
pointed
out
to
her
what
earthly
motive
could
i
have
for
saying
that
an
egg
was
cold
if
it
was
not
what
should
i
gain
by
it
of
course
she
had
no
answer
that
is
no
reasonable
answer
then
after
breakfast
i
broke
my
in
two
places
no
i
was
not
angry
i
hope
i
can
keep
my
temper
as
well
as
most
men
but
i
was
in
a
state
of
mind
bordering
on
the
irritable
eliza
came
dressed
for
going
out
asked
me
why
i
was
not
ready
and
said
we
should
miss
the
indeed
said
i
and
what
precisely
might
you
mean
by
the
i
mean
precisely
the
train
which
leaves
here
for
the
city
at
seventeen
minutes
to
ten
one
of
your
usual
mistakes
i
replied
the
train
is
and
not
have
you
a
she
asked
no
because
if
you
had
a
i
could
show
you
that
you
are
wrong
why
i
it
the
if
i
had
a
i
could
show
you
most
certainly
that
it
is
the
not
that
you
believe
it
even
then
you
too
obstinate
eliza
too
certain
of
yourself
look
here
i
observed
after
she
had
argued
that
point
at
some
length
let
us
come
back
to
the
original
subject
of
discussion
which
of
us
travels
most
to
and
from
london
that
is
the
reasonable
way
to
settle
it
you
do
on
but
you
never
go
on
sundays
and
the
sunday
trains
are
different
i
am
fully
aware
of
the
difference
every
day
i
am
thrown
into
constant
contact
with
the
only
last
night
i
was
looking
at
them
at
the
station
as
far
as
i
know
my
memory
is
not
going
no
more
is
mine
really
a
week
ago
i
purchased
and
brought
home
six
new
collars
they
are
not
marked
why
because
you
forgot
them
at
this
very
moment
that
i
am
speaking
to
you
i
am
wearing
an
unmarked
collar
yes
but
i
only
forgot
them
one
day
then
why
did
you
not
mark
them
on
the
other
days
because
on
the
other
days
you
forgot
to
bring
home
the
yes
i
said
in
a
sense
that
is
true
i
have
my
own
business
to
attend
to
in
the
city
without
always
thinking
about
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
and
why
bring
it
in
we
are
not
talking
about
we
are
talking
about
trains
she
said
that
i
began
it
and
of
course
i
pointed
out
to
her
that
i
had
done
nothing
of
the
kind
we
argued
for
some
little
time
as
to
which
of
us
had
begun
it
and
then
eliza
said
in
her
spiteful
way
we
are
not
talking
about
which
of
us
began
it
we
are
talking
about
trains
it
very
little
use
talking
to
you
about
trains
i
know
you
wrong
i
would
stake
my
life
cheerfully
that
it
is
and
not
but
you
never
own
you
wrong
you
too
obstinate
for
that
of
course
i
do
own
i
wrong
because
i
not
wrong
that
would
be
silly
she
added
reflectively
even
if
it
was
i
should
be
wrong
all
i
said
was
that
we
should
miss
the
well
if
there
is
no
we
can
not
catch
it
and
what
you
do
catch
you
miss
absurd
nonsense
if
you
do
not
catch
scarlet
fever
you
do
not
say
that
you
miss
it
she
replied
we
are
not
talking
about
scarlet
fever
we
are
talking
about
trains
bah
i
exclaimed
i
should
have
added
more
but
at
this
moment
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
struck
ten
the
conundrums
i
had
bought
the
little
book
at
the
station
stall
and
it
seemed
to
be
very
well
worth
the
sixpence
which
i
paid
for
it
it
was
entitled
everybody
book
of
bright
and
original
conundrums
of
course
i
had
an
idea
in
my
head
in
buying
the
book
i
am
not
the
man
to
throw
away
my
money
to
no
purpose
i
thought
that
these
conundrums
would
be
not
only
a
pleasant
amusement
but
also
a
valuable
intellectual
exercise
to
eliza
and
myself
during
the
winter
evenings
then
we
could
use
them
for
social
purposes
during
the
christmas
party
season
i
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
with
others
but
i
have
often
found
when
introduced
to
a
lady
that
i
have
said
good
evening
and
then
had
absolutely
nothing
else
to
say
with
the
help
of
the
conundrum
book
i
would
fill
in
any
awkward
pause
by
asking
her
who
was
the
most
amiable
king
in
history
that
would
break
the
ice
besides
if
we
kept
the
book
reasonably
clean
it
might
afterward
make
a
very
serviceable
and
acceptable
present
to
eliza
mother
i
generally
know
pretty
well
what
i
am
doing
i
think
i
looked
at
two
or
three
of
the
conundrums
on
the
way
home
there
was
one
which
i
do
not
remember
precisely
but
remarkably
clever
something
about
training
the
shoot
and
shooting
the
train
i
often
wonder
who
it
is
who
thinks
of
these
things
i
was
perhaps
rather
unfortunate
in
the
evening
when
i
brought
the
book
home
something
may
have
occurred
to
put
eliza
out
she
was
inclined
to
be
quite
sharp
with
me
i
asked
her
gaily
in
the
passage
when
i
came
in
can
you
tell
me
dearest
the
difference
between
a
camel
and
a
corkscrew
if
not
here
is
a
little
volume
which
will
inform
you
oh
yes
one
used
for
drawing
corks
and
the
other
is
you
need
have
wasted
sixpence
on
a
rubbishy
book
to
tell
me
that
but
your
answer
is
not
the
correct
one
i
replied
the
correct
answer
contains
a
joke
think
again
well
i
ca
then
i
got
the
wash
to
count
i
said
that
the
wash
could
wait
but
she
would
not
appear
to
hear
me
and
went
off
at
supper
i
took
occasion
to
say
you
answered
me
very
tartly
when
i
asked
you
this
afternoon
for
the
difference
between
a
camel
and
a
corkscrew
perhaps
you
would
not
have
done
so
had
you
known
that
i
bought
that
book
with
the
intention
of
sending
it
as
a
present
to
your
mother
do
you
think
ma
would
care
about
it
i
think
it
would
cheer
her
lonely
hours
there
are
upwards
of
a
thousand
conundrums
in
the
book
i
have
only
read
twelve
but
i
found
them
all
exceedingly
amusing
and
at
the
same
time
perfectly
refined
well
i
do
see
the
good
of
them
they
are
an
intellectual
exercise
if
you
try
to
guess
the
right
answer
i
do
believe
anybody
ever
did
or
ever
will
guess
the
right
answer
if
i
had
time
i
said
i
believe
i
could
generally
think
out
a
witty
answer
myself
i
do
not
want
to
boast
but
i
believe
so
very
well
then
said
eliza
snatching
up
the
book
and
opening
it
at
random
here
one
for
you
a
lady
slipped
down
the
steps
of
paul
cathedral
what
would
she
say
give
me
the
answer
to
that
i
will
try
to
i
replied
now
just
at
the
moment
when
eliza
put
the
question
i
felt
that
i
had
really
got
the
answer
and
then
it
seemed
to
pass
away
from
me
later
in
the
evening
i
was
certainly
on
the
right
track
when
eliza
dropped
her
scissors
and
the
noise
again
put
me
off
i
spent
a
very
poor
night
the
answer
kept
sort
of
coming
and
going
just
as
i
was
dropping
off
to
sleep
i
seemed
to
have
thought
of
the
answer
and
then
i
would
wake
up
to
be
sure
of
it
and
find
it
had
slipped
me
again
as
i
was
leaving
the
office
in
the
evening
after
thinking
till
my
head
ached
without
arriving
at
any
result
i
put
the
question
to
one
of
our
clerks
i
thought
he
might
possibly
know
no
he
said
i
do
know
what
a
lady
would
say
if
she
slipped
down
those
steps
i
could
make
a
fair
guess
at
what
a
man
would
say
if
that
any
good
to
you
of
course
it
was
not
so
on
my
return
home
i
told
eliza
that
i
had
not
had
enough
time
to
spare
to
think
of
the
answer
and
i
should
be
glad
to
know
where
she
had
put
the
book
oh
i
sent
that
to
mother
she
said
i
thought
you
wanted
it
sent
you
might
have
waited
until
you
knew
whether
i
had
finished
with
it
but
however
what
was
the
answer
to
that
silly
riddle
the
one
about
paul
cathedral
that
was
in
the
book
at
all
i
made
up
the
question
out
of
my
own
head
for
fun
then
i
replied
all
i
can
say
is
that
your
idea
of
fun
is
not
mine
it
seems
to
me
to
be
acting
a
lie
it
was
not
a
conundrum
at
all
it
would
have
been
if
you
could
have
thought
of
an
answer
say
no
more
i
replied
coldly
i
prefer
to
drop
the
subject
the
ink
the
contained
a
shallow
sediment
with
short
hairs
grit
and
a
little
moisture
in
it
it
came
out
on
the
pen
in
chunks
when
i
had
spoiled
the
second
postcard
eliza
said
i
was
not
to
talk
like
that
very
well
then
i
said
why
do
you
have
the
refilled
i
not
made
of
postcards
and
i
hate
waste
she
replied
that
anybody
would
think
i
was
made
of
something
to
hear
me
talk
i
thought
i
had
never
heard
a
poorer
retort
and
told
her
so
i
did
not
stay
to
argue
it
further
as
i
had
to
be
off
to
the
city
on
my
return
i
found
the
full
this
i
thought
to
myself
is
very
nice
of
eliza
i
had
a
letter
i
wanted
to
write
and
sat
down
to
it
i
wrote
one
word
and
it
came
out
a
delicate
pale
gray
i
called
eliza
at
once
i
was
never
quieter
in
my
manner
and
it
was
absurd
of
her
to
say
that
i
need
howl
the
house
down
we
will
not
discuss
that
i
replied
just
now
i
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
what
do
you
want
to
write
letters
for
now
you
might
just
as
well
have
done
them
at
the
office
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
in
a
continental
manner
you
are
probably
not
aware
that
i
was
writing
to
your
own
mother
she
has
so
few
pleasures
if
you
do
not
feel
rebuked
now
i
do
think
mamma
will
lend
you
any
more
if
you
do
write
we
will
not
enter
into
that
why
did
you
fill
the
with
water
i
did
then
who
did
nobody
did
i
did
think
of
it
until
and
then
well
the
tea
was
there
i
once
read
a
story
where
a
man
laughed
a
low
mirthless
laugh
the
laugh
came
to
me
quite
naturally
on
this
occasion
say
no
more
i
said
this
is
contemptible
now
i
forbid
you
to
get
the
ink
i
will
get
it
myself
on
the
following
night
she
asked
me
if
i
had
bought
that
ink
i
replied
no
eliza
it
has
been
an
exceptionally
busy
day
and
i
have
not
had
the
time
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
it
perhaps
i
supposed
you
would
say
that
i
said
in
you
it
does
not
surprise
me
a
week
later
eliza
said
that
she
wanted
to
do
her
accounts
i
am
glad
of
that
i
said
now
you
will
know
the
misery
of
living
without
ink
in
the
house
no
i
she
said
because
i
always
do
my
accounts
in
pencil
about
three
months
ago
i
asked
you
to
fill
that
with
ink
why
is
it
not
done
because
you
also
definitely
forbade
me
to
get
any
ink
to
fill
it
with
and
you
said
you
get
it
yourself
and
it
was
three
months
ago
i
always
knew
you
could
not
argue
eliza
i
replied
but
i
am
sorry
to
see
that
your
memory
is
failing
you
as
well
on
the
next
day
i
bought
a
penny
bottle
of
ink
and
left
it
behind
me
in
an
omnibus
there
was
another
bottle
this
must
have
been
a
week
later
which
i
bought
but
dropped
on
the
pavement
where
it
broke
i
did
not
mention
these
things
to
eliza
but
i
asked
her
how
much
longer
she
was
going
to
cast
a
shade
over
our
married
life
by
neglecting
to
fill
the
why
she
said
that
has
been
done
days
and
days
ago
how
can
you
be
so
unjust
it
was
as
she
had
said
i
made
up
my
mind
at
once
to
write
to
mother
who
rightly
or
wrongly
considers
that
i
have
a
talent
for
i
felt
happier
now
than
i
had
done
for
some
time
and
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
eliza
that
i
had
forgiven
her
i
wrote
a
long
cheerful
letter
to
her
mother
and
thought
i
would
show
it
to
eliza
before
i
posted
it
i
called
to
her
come
down
darling
and
see
what
i
done
then
i
sat
down
again
and
knocked
the
over
the
ink
covered
the
letter
the
table
my
clothes
and
the
carpet
a
black
stream
of
it
wandered
away
looking
for
something
else
to
spoil
then
eliza
came
down
and
saw
what
i
had
done
to
this
day
she
can
not
see
that
it
was
partly
her
own
fault
the
bottle
of
course
was
too
full
the
public
scandal
i
am
not
a
landlord
it
suits
my
purpose
better
and
is
in
every
way
more
convenient
to
rent
a
small
house
on
a
yearly
agreement
but
if
i
were
a
landlord
i
would
not
allow
any
tenant
of
mine
to
do
anything
that
tended
to
undermine
and
honeycomb
the
gentility
of
the
district
i
should
take
a
very
short
method
with
such
a
tenant
i
should
say
to
him
or
her
now
then
either
this
stops
or
you
go
out
this
instant
that
would
settle
it
however
i
am
not
a
landlord
even
as
a
tenant
i
take
a
very
natural
interest
in
the
district
in
which
i
live
i
chose
the
district
carefully
because
it
was
residential
and
not
commercial
the
houses
are
not
very
large
and
they
might
be
more
solidly
built
but
they
are
not
shops
they
have
electric
bells
and
small
strips
of
garden
and
a
generally
genteel
appearance
two
of
the
houses
in
arthur
street
are
occupied
by
and
bear
brass
plates
i
do
not
object
to
that
is
a
profession
and
i
suppose
that
in
a
way
i
should
be
considered
a
professional
man
myself
nor
do
i
object
to
the
letting
of
apartments
as
long
as
it
is
done
modestly
and
without
large
vulgar
but
the
general
tone
of
the
district
is
good
and
i
do
most
strongly
object
to
anything
which
would
tend
to
lower
it
it
was
as
far
as
i
remember
on
the
tuesday
evening
that
eliza
rather
lost
her
temper
about
the
hairpins
and
said
that
if
i
kept
on
taking
them
and
taking
them
she
did
not
see
how
she
was
to
do
her
hair
at
all
this
seemed
to
me
rather
unjust
i
had
not
taken
the
hairpins
for
my
own
pleasure
the
fact
is
that
the
from
the
kitchen
sink
frequently
gets
blocked
and
a
hairpin
will
often
do
it
when
nothing
else
will
i
replied
coldly
but
without
temper
that
in
future
i
would
have
hairpins
of
my
own
she
said
what
nonsense
at
this
i
rose
and
went
to
bed
i
think
that
most
people
who
know
me
know
that
i
am
a
man
of
my
word
on
the
following
morning
before
breakfast
i
went
into
the
high
street
to
buy
a
pennyworth
of
hairpins
the
short
cut
from
our
road
into
the
high
street
is
down
bloodstone
terrace
it
was
in
bloodstone
terrace
that
i
witnessed
a
sight
which
pained
and
surprised
me
very
much
it
disgusted
me
it
was
a
disgrace
to
the
district
and
amounted
to
a
public
scandal
augustine
which
is
the
third
house
in
the
terrace
had
taken
in
washing
and
not
only
had
taken
in
washing
but
were
using
their
front
garden
as
a
an
offensive
thing
of
that
kind
makes
my
blood
boil
eliza
i
said
as
i
brushed
my
hat
preparatory
to
leaving
for
the
city
i
intend
to
write
to
hamilton
have
you
got
the
money
then
eliza
asked
eagerly
if
you
refer
to
last
quarter
rent
i
do
not
mean
to
forward
it
immediately
a
certain
amount
of
credit
is
usual
between
landlord
and
tenant
an
established
firm
of
agents
like
hamilton
bland
must
know
that
yesterday
was
the
third
time
they
written
for
the
money
anyhow
and
you
can
say
what
you
like
what
are
you
writing
for
then
i
have
a
complaint
to
make
well
i
would
make
any
complaints
until
i
paid
last
quarter
if
i
were
you
they
only
turn
you
out
i
think
not
i
make
the
complaint
in
their
interest
when
a
tenant
in
bloodstone
terrace
is
acting
in
a
way
calculated
to
bring
the
whole
neighbourhood
into
disrepute
and
depreciate
the
value
of
house
property
the
agents
would
probably
be
glad
to
hear
of
it
well
you
missing
your
train
you
run
off
and
do
write
any
letters
until
then
you
can
talk
about
it
if
you
like
in
the
evening
at
supper
eliza
said
she
had
been
down
bloodstone
terrace
and
could
not
see
what
i
was
making
all
the
fuss
about
it
is
simply
this
i
said
augustine
is
converted
into
a
laundry
and
the
front
garden
used
as
a
in
a
way
that
to
my
mind
is
not
decent
yes
said
eliza
that
pedder
the
poor
woman
has
to
do
something
for
her
living
she
just
started
and
only
got
one
job
at
present
it
would
be
cruel
not
at
all
let
her
wash
if
she
must
wash
but
let
her
wash
somewhere
else
i
can
not
have
these
offensive
rags
flapping
in
my
face
when
i
walk
down
the
street
they
not
offensive
rags
i
most
particular
about
your
things
what
do
you
mean
it
your
things
that
she
washes
i
thought
i
give
her
a
start
i
dashed
off
half
a
glass
of
beer
put
the
glass
down
with
a
bang
and
flung
myself
back
in
the
chair
without
a
word
do
behave
in
that
silly
way
said
eliza
she
a
halfpenny
cheaper
on
the
shirt
than
the
last
woman
you
need
not
mention
that
i
replied
in
any
case
i
shall
not
complain
now
i
must
bear
the
burden
of
any
mistakes
that
you
make
i
am
well
aware
of
it
i
tell
her
to
hang
them
out
at
the
back
in
future
she
can
hang
them
where
she
pleases
i
suppose
i
can
bear
it
only
one
more
trial
to
bear
one
thing
goes
after
another
on
the
contrary
said
eliza
she
never
lost
as
much
as
a
collar
there
a
smut
on
your
nose
it
can
stop
there
i
said
moodily
and
went
out
into
the
garden
the
christian
martyr
the
christian
martyr
was
what
is
called
an
engraving
and
a
very
tasteful
thing
too
besides
being
the
largest
picture
we
had
it
represented
a
young
woman
drowned
floating
down
a
river
by
night
with
her
hands
tied
and
a
very
pleasing
expression
on
her
face
with
the
frame
maple
and
a
gilt
border
inside
it
came
to
i
bought
it
in
the
edgware
road
on
my
own
responsibility
and
carried
it
home
i
thought
eliza
would
like
it
and
she
did
poor
thing
she
said
you
can
see
she
must
have
been
a
lady
too
but
frightfully
dusty
you
ca
get
everything
for
if
you
been
under
the
counter
in
a
dirty
little
well
all
right
i
was
complaining
but
i
like
things
clean
and
she
took
the
christian
martyr
into
the
kitchen
where
did
you
mean
to
put
it
asked
eliza
the
only
good
place
would
be
between
charge
of
the
light
and
stag
at
bay
what
in
the
certainly
well
i
should
said
eliza
it
a
sacred
subject
and
we
use
the
on
sundays
that
the
place
i
think
i
can
trust
my
own
taste
i
said
i
got
a
nail
and
a
hammer
and
began
eliza
said
afterward
that
she
had
known
the
chair
would
break
before
ever
i
stood
on
it
then
you
might
have
mentioned
it
i
said
coldly
however
you
shall
learn
that
when
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
a
thing
i
do
it
i
rang
the
bell
and
told
the
girl
to
fetch
the
steps
i
hung
the
christian
martyr
and
was
very
pleased
with
the
effect
the
whole
room
looked
brighter
and
more
cheerful
i
asked
eliza
what
she
thought
and
she
answered
as
i
expected
that
the
picture
ought
to
have
been
in
the
eliza
i
said
there
is
one
little
fault
which
you
should
try
to
correct
it
is
pigheadedness
at
breakfast
next
morning
the
picture
was
all
crooked
i
put
it
straight
then
the
girl
brought
in
the
bacon
rubbed
against
the
picture
and
put
it
crooked
again
i
put
it
straight
again
and
sat
down
the
girl
in
passing
out
put
it
crooked
once
more
really
i
said
to
eliza
this
is
a
little
too
much
then
put
some
of
it
back
i
was
not
referring
to
what
i
have
on
my
plate
but
to
that
conduct
i
do
buy
martyrs
for
her
to
treat
them
in
that
way
and
i
think
you
should
speak
about
it
she
ca
get
past
without
rubbing
against
it
you
put
it
so
low
i
said
it
would
be
better
in
the
as
usual
i
kept
my
temper
eliza
i
said
have
you
already
forgotten
what
i
told
you
last
night
we
all
of
us
even
the
best
of
us
have
our
faults
but
surely
while
you
talking
you
missing
your
train
she
said
on
my
return
from
the
city
i
went
into
the
and
found
the
picture
gone
eliza
was
sitting
there
as
calmly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
where
is
the
martyr
i
asked
on
the
sofa
in
the
you
said
yourself
that
it
was
only
in
the
way
in
here
i
thought
you
might
like
to
hang
it
there
i
am
not
angry
i
said
but
i
am
pained
then
i
fetched
the
christian
martyr
and
put
it
in
its
old
place
you
are
a
funny
man
said
eliza
i
never
know
what
you
want
as
we
were
going
up
to
bed
that
night
we
heard
a
loud
bang
in
the
the
christian
martyr
was
lying
on
the
floor
with
the
glass
broken
it
had
also
smashed
a
japanese
teapot
i
wish
you
never
bought
any
martyr
said
eliza
if
we
had
a
mad
bull
in
the
place
it
could
have
been
worse
i
sure
i
not
going
to
buy
a
new
glass
for
it
so
next
day
i
bought
a
new
glass
myself
in
the
city
and
brought
it
back
with
me
but
apparently
eliza
had
changed
her
mind
for
a
new
glass
had
already
been
fitted
in
and
it
was
hanging
in
the
just
where
it
had
been
before
as
a
reward
to
eliza
i
took
it
down
and
put
it
up
in
the
she
smiled
in
a
curious
sort
of
way
that
i
did
not
quite
like
but
i
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
more
about
it
the
pagrams
properly
speaking
we
had
quarrelled
with
the
pagrams
we
both
lived
in
the
same
street
and
pagram
is
in
the
same
office
as
myself
for
some
time
we
were
on
terms
then
one
night
they
looked
in
to
borrow
well
i
forget
now
precisely
what
it
was
but
they
looked
in
to
borrow
something
a
month
afterward
as
they
had
not
returned
it
we
sent
round
to
ask
pagram
replied
that
it
had
already
been
returned
and
pagram
this
was
the
damning
thing
told
me
at
the
office
in
so
many
words
that
they
had
never
borrowed
it
now
i
hate
anything
like
deception
so
does
eliza
for
two
years
or
more
eliza
and
pagram
have
met
in
the
street
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
each
other
i
speak
to
pagram
in
the
office
being
as
you
might
say
more
or
less
paid
to
speak
to
him
but
outside
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
it
was
on
wednesday
morning
i
think
at
breakfast
that
eliza
said
i
just
heard
from
jane
who
had
it
from
the
milkman
pagram
had
a
baby
born
last
night
well
that
i
observed
is
of
no
earthly
interest
to
us
of
course
it
is
i
only
just
mentioned
it
is
it
a
boy
or
girl
a
girl
i
only
hope
she
will
bring
it
up
to
speak
the
truth
i
replied
that
she
might
hope
what
we
did
not
expect
so
far
eliza
had
taken
just
exactly
the
tone
that
i
wanted
but
as
i
watched
her
i
saw
her
expression
change
and
her
underlip
pulled
down
on
one
side
as
it
were
well
i
said
rather
sharply
what
is
it
these
people
are
nothing
to
us
no
but
it
reminded
me
our
little
girl
my
baby
that
died
and
i
here
she
put
down
her
knife
and
fork
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
there
she
stood
with
her
back
to
me
i
had
a
mind
to
speak
to
her
about
the
foolishness
of
recalling
what
must
be
very
upsetting
to
her
but
i
said
nothing
and
began
to
brush
my
silk
hat
briskly
it
was
about
time
that
i
was
starting
for
the
city
i
went
out
then
i
came
back
kissed
eliza
and
went
out
again
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
pagram
at
the
office
i
should
have
thought
you
have
taken
a
day
off
i
said
ca
afford
that
just
now
he
replied
in
rather
a
surly
way
all
well
at
home
no
by
my
watch
i
said
that
office
clock
five
minutes
slow
what
do
you
make
it
do
know
left
my
watch
at
home
i
had
noticed
that
he
was
not
wearing
his
watch
later
in
the
day
i
had
some
more
conversation
with
him
he
is
quite
my
subordinate
at
the
office
and
i
really
do
know
why
i
should
have
taken
so
much
notice
of
him
when
i
came
back
that
night
i
was
in
two
minds
whether
to
tell
eliza
or
not
she
hates
anything
like
extravagance
and
if
i
told
her
i
felt
sure
she
would
be
displeased
at
the
same
time
if
i
did
not
tell
her
and
she
found
it
out
afterward
she
would
be
still
more
displeased
however
i
decided
to
say
nothing
about
it
i
was
a
little
nervous
on
the
point
and
i
own
that
my
conscience
reproached
me
as
i
came
into
the
hall
eliza
came
down
the
staircase
she
was
dressed
for
going
out
and
had
a
basket
in
her
hand
she
said
i
want
you
to
let
me
go
over
to
the
pagrams
to
see
if
i
can
do
anything
she
and
the
baby
are
both
very
ill
the
nurse
has
had
no
sleep
they
no
one
else
to
help
them
and
and
i
going
now
do
you
think
this
is
necessary
eliza
i
began
when
you
come
to
consider
the
position
we
taken
up
with
regard
to
the
pagrams
for
two
years
and
the
scandalous
way
in
which
they
here
i
stopped
the
hall
door
was
shut
and
eliza
had
gone
and
it
was
not
worth
while
to
continue
now
i
thought
to
myself
it
ten
to
one
that
eliza
finds
me
out
and
if
she
does
she
probably
make
herself
unpleasant
however
i
determined
not
to
trouble
myself
about
it
if
it
came
to
that
i
flattered
myself
that
i
could
make
myself
as
unpleasant
as
most
people
when
any
occasion
arose
it
was
hours
before
eliza
returned
she
burst
into
the
room
and
said
they
both
better
and
the
baby
a
beauty
and
i
to
go
back
afternoon
indeed
i
said
i
do
know
that
you
not
going
a
little
too
far
with
these
people
do
you
think
so
i
found
you
out
you
did
tell
me
but
pagram
did
you
lent
him
three
pounds
this
morning
we
ca
afford
that
well
well
i
said
i
managed
to
get
some
overtime
work
to
begin
next
week
that
that
come
out
all
right
you
ought
to
leave
these
business
matters
to
me
anyhow
it
no
good
finding
fault
and
does
pagram
generally
return
what
lent
i
lost
my
temper
and
said
that
i
did
care
a
damn
and
then
just
then
i
saw
that
she
was
not
really
displeased
about
it
why
she
said
you
silly
i
glad
you
did
it
the
poor
things
were
at
their
wits
end
and
had
got
they
got
nothing
you
saved
them
and
i
never
have
liked
anything
you
done
half
as
much
as
this
here
eliza
burst
into
tears
which
is
really
very
unusual
with
her
promotion
how
true
it
is
as
one
of
our
english
poets
has
remarked
that
it
is
always
darkest
before
the
silver
lining
while
this
little
work
was
actually
in
the
hands
of
the
printers
an
incident
occurred
of
such
great
and
importance
that
i
can
not
refrain
from
making
it
the
subject
of
an
additional
paper
i
can
give
it
in
one
word
promotion
it
came
at
a
time
when
i
was
suffering
from
great
depression
and
considerable
irritation
as
i
have
already
indicated
in
my
opening
remark
it
was
on
a
wednesday
morning
and
those
who
know
me
know
that
invariably
on
sunday
wednesday
and
friday
i
put
on
a
clean
shirt
the
number
may
seem
excessive
and
perhaps
out
of
proportion
to
my
income
but
i
own
without
shame
that
i
am
careful
as
to
my
personal
appearance
i
must
also
add
that
i
am
very
particularly
careful
and
i
think
rightly
on
the
question
of
the
airing
of
linen
all
i
said
was
that
i
should
put
on
that
shirt
whether
eliza
liked
it
or
not
and
that
it
would
probably
give
me
my
death
but
that
it
did
not
matter
and
perhaps
the
sooner
it
was
all
over
the
better
there
were
circumstances
under
which
life
was
hardly
worth
living
and
when
one
express
injunctions
were
continually
disregarded
one
began
to
despair
eliza
spoke
quite
snappishly
and
said
that
my
linen
was
always
properly
aired
and
that
i
was
too
fussy
i
replied
without
losing
my
temper
that
there
was
airing
and
airing
even
now
i
can
not
think
that
eliza
was
either
just
or
accurate
at
one
or
two
other
little
circumstances
occurred
to
put
me
out
a
teacup
which
is
filled
so
full
that
it
overflows
into
the
saucer
is
a
perfect
thorn
in
the
flesh
to
me
so
is
bacon
which
is
burnt
to
a
cinder
i
hardly
did
more
than
mention
it
but
eliza
seemed
put
out
she
said
i
did
nothing
but
find
fault
and
as
for
the
bacon
i
had
better
go
into
the
kitchen
and
find
fault
with
the
girl
for
it
was
the
girl
who
had
cooked
it
on
the
contrary
i
said
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
when
a
servant
does
wrong
it
is
her
mistress
who
deserves
the
censure
go
it
said
eliza
an
expression
which
i
do
not
think
to
be
quite
ladylike
and
if
a
runs
over
you
in
oxford
street
you
go
and
get
the
damages
out
of
the
shah
of
persia
that
the
line
to
take
this
answer
exasperated
me
by
its
silliness
and
i
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
not
to
say
another
word
of
any
kind
during
breakfast
indeed
but
for
the
fact
that
i
had
not
quite
finished
my
bacon
and
that
i
hate
waste
i
should
have
got
up
and
walked
out
of
the
room
there
and
then
a
little
later
i
happened
to
look
up
and
it
struck
me
from
face
that
she
might
be
going
to
cry
i
therefore
made
a
point
of
saying
that
the
butter
was
better
than
we
had
been
having
lately
and
that
it
looked
like
being
a
fine
day
after
all
anything
like
weakness
is
repellent
to
me
but
still
when
one
sees
that
one
words
have
gone
home
one
is
justified
in
not
pressing
the
matter
further
still
i
am
prepared
to
own
that
i
started
for
the
city
in
but
low
spirits
and
with
no
inclination
to
join
in
the
frivolous
conversation
that
was
going
on
in
the
railway
carriage
on
arriving
at
the
office
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
figgis
our
head
clerk
was
not
there
he
gave
me
the
tonic
port
and
was
inclined
to
be
dictatorial
but
i
must
confess
that
he
was
always
a
most
punctual
man
i
was
very
much
surprised
our
senior
partner
bagshaw
came
much
earlier
than
usual
to
be
precise
and
sent
for
me
at
once
he
is
a
big
fat
man
he
speaks
in
short
sentences
and
breathes
hard
in
between
them
at
the
moment
of
entering
his
room
i
was
as
certain
that
i
was
about
to
be
sacked
as
i
have
ever
been
of
anything
that
i
did
not
really
know
i
was
wrong
he
made
me
sit
down
glared
at
me
and
began
yesterday
evening
we
detained
figgis
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
end
of
our
interview
with
him
he
left
this
office
for
ever
never
to
return
never
i
said
that
i
was
very
much
astonished
we
were
we
known
there
was
a
leakage
people
knew
what
we
were
doing
people
who
ought
to
know
he
sold
information
we
put
on
detectives
they
proved
it
see
i
said
that
i
saw
so
you
got
figgis
place
for
the
future
see
at
that
moment
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
it
was
so
absolutely
unexpected
give
me
time
and
i
think
i
can
provide
a
few
words
suitable
to
the
occasion
as
well
as
any
man
but
now
i
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
but
thank
you
he
went
on
to
explain
that
this
would
mean
an
immediate
rise
of
and
a
prospective
rise
of
a
further
at
the
end
of
a
year
if
my
work
was
satisfactory
he
said
that
i
had
not
figgis
abilities
of
course
but
that
a
very
close
eye
had
been
kept
on
me
lately
and
i
had
shown
myself
to
be
honest
methodical
and
careful
in
details
it
was
also
believed
that
i
should
realize
the
importance
of
a
responsible
and
confidential
position
and
that
i
should
keep
the
men
under
me
up
to
the
mark
the
rest
of
our
conversation
was
concerned
with
my
new
duties
and
at
the
close
of
it
he
handed
me
figgis
keys
my
own
name
and
the
office
address
had
been
already
put
on
the
label
i
should
not
be
fair
to
myself
if
i
did
not
make
some
reference
to
bagshaw
comparison
of
figgis
abilities
and
my
own
i
will
merely
state
the
fact
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
figgis
has
gained
success
or
avoided
failure
from
suggestions
made
to
him
by
myself
that
he
did
not
give
me
the
credit
for
this
with
the
firm
is
precisely
what
i
should
have
expected
from
a
man
of
that
character
however
i
have
my
opportunity
now
and
the
firm
will
see
when
i
returned
to
the
clerks
office
i
found
one
of
the
juniors
playing
the
fool
i
wish
you
stop
that
please
i
said
and
get
on
with
your
work
who
gave
you
the
right
to
give
orders
here
he
asked
me
rudely
fortunately
that
was
what
i
had
expected
he
would
say
and
therefore
i
had
my
answer
ready
bagshaw
did
three
minutes
ago
when
he
made
me
head
of
this
department
in
place
of
mr
figgis
and
without
another
word
i
went
calmly
to
figgis
desk
and
unlocked
it
the
effect
was
remarkable
and
gave
me
great
pleasure
during
the
luncheon
hour
i
received
several
congratulations
and
was
pressed
to
partake
of
liquor
but
i
had
long
ago
made
up
my
mind
that
if
the
firm
ever
did
place
me
in
a
good
and
responsible
position
i
would
give
up
alcohol
during
business
hours
altogether
i
carried
out
that
resolution
and
shall
continue
to
do
so
figgis
with
all
his
abilities
was
frequently
drowsy
in
the
afternoon
apart
from
that
i
hope
i
was
not
wanting
in
geniality
i
snatched
a
few
moments
to
telegraph
to
eliza
meet
train
very
good
news
for
you
on
my
way
to
the
station
i
purchased
a
small
bottle
of
champagne
it
cost
half
a
crown
but
the
price
for
this
wine
is
always
pretty
stiff
i
also
took
back
with
me
in
my
bag
a
tinned
tongue
and
some
pears
eliza
was
waiting
for
me
and
was
obviously
excited
she
had
guessed
what
had
happened
got
figgis
berth
she
said
yes
let
get
off
the
platform
as
soon
as
we
can
everybody
looking
at
us
we
walked
home
very
quickly
eliza
asking
questions
all
the
way
and
looking
as
i
noticed
quite
five
years
younger
after
what
i
have
said
as
to
my
purchases
i
need
not
add
that
supper
that
night
was
a
perfect
banquet
we
had
a
long
discussion
as
to
our
future
and
did
not
get
to
bed
until
past
eleven
i
was
at
first
in
favour
of
taking
a
rather
better
house
but
eliza
thought
we
should
do
more
wisely
to
spread
the
money
over
making
ourselves
more
comfortable
generally
when
she
came
to
go
into
it
in
detail
i
found
that
on
the
whole
hers
was
the
preferable
course
new
curtains
for
the
are
to
be
put
in
hand
at
once
the
charwoman
is
to
come
regularly
once
a
week
we
raised
the
girl
wages
a
pound
and
she
went
into
hysterics
eliza
has
insisted
that
i
am
to
have
a
in
future
there
is
much
can
be
done
with
on
the
whole
about
the
happiest
evening
of
my
life
the
end
