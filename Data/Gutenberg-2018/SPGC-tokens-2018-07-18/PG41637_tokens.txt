nature
mislead
madhouse
beneath
dense
gray
clouds
through
which
no
sun
shone
lay
a
forgotten
planet
it
was
a
nightmare
world
of
grotesque
and
terrifying
life
gigantic
beetles
spiders
bugs
and
ants
filled
the
putrid
musty
earth
ready
to
kill
and
devour
anything
in
sight
there
were
men
amidst
this
horror
men
who
cringed
and
ran
from
the
ravening
monsters
and
huddled
in
the
mushroom
forests
at
night
burl
was
one
of
these
creatures
but
one
day
inspiration
hit
burl
he
would
find
a
weapon
he
would
fight
back
and
with
this
idea
the
first
step
was
taken
in
man
most
desperate
flight
for
freedom
in
this
most
horrible
of
all
worlds
but
it
was
only
a
first
step
about
the
characters
in
this
book
this
is
something
of
an
oddity
among
fiction
stories
because
some
of
its
characters
may
be
met
in
person
if
you
wish
down
at
the
nearest
or
thicket
you
are
quite
likely
to
see
a
large
and
unusually
perfect
with
a
silk
ribbon
woven
into
its
center
its
engineer
is
the
garden
spider
whose
abdomen
may
be
as
big
as
your
thumb
i
do
not
name
it
to
impress
you
but
to
suggest
a
sort
of
experience
take
a
bit
of
straw
and
disturb
the
web
do
break
the
cables
simply
tap
them
a
bit
the
spider
will
know
by
the
feel
of
things
that
you
are
prey
and
that
it
ca
eat
you
so
it
will
set
out
frightening
you
away
it
will
run
nimbly
to
the
center
of
the
web
and
shake
itself
violently
the
whole
web
will
vibrate
so
that
presently
the
spider
may
be
swinging
through
an
arc
inches
in
length
and
blurred
by
the
speed
of
its
swing
you
are
supposed
to
be
scared
when
you
are
alarmed
enough
the
spider
will
stop
that
spider
very
much
magnified
is
in
this
book
with
crickets
and
grasshoppers
and
divers
beetles
you
may
not
know
personally
but
this
is
not
an
insect
book
but
if
the
habits
of
the
creatures
in
it
are
authentic
it
is
because
they
are
much
more
dramatic
and
interesting
than
things
one
can
invent
murray
leinster
the
made
the
first
landing
on
the
planet
which
had
no
name
it
was
an
admirable
planet
in
many
ways
it
had
an
ample
atmosphere
and
many
seas
which
the
nearby
sun
warmed
so
lavishly
that
a
perpetual
hid
them
and
most
of
the
solid
ground
from
view
it
had
mountains
and
continents
and
islands
and
high
plateaus
it
had
day
and
night
and
wind
and
rain
and
its
mean
temperature
was
within
the
range
to
which
human
beings
could
readily
accommodate
it
was
rather
on
the
tropic
side
but
not
unpleasant
but
there
was
no
life
on
it
no
animals
roamed
its
continents
no
vegetation
grew
from
its
rocks
not
even
bacteria
struggled
with
its
stones
to
turn
them
into
soil
so
there
was
no
soil
rock
and
stones
and
gravel
and
even
sand
yes
but
no
soil
in
which
any
vegetation
could
grow
no
living
thing
however
small
swam
in
its
oceans
so
there
was
not
even
mud
on
its
it
was
one
of
that
disappointing
vast
majority
of
worlds
which
turned
up
when
the
galaxy
was
first
explored
people
could
live
on
it
because
nothing
had
lived
there
before
its
water
was
fresh
and
its
oceans
were
harmless
its
air
was
and
breathable
but
it
was
of
no
use
whatever
for
men
the
only
possible
purpose
it
could
serve
would
have
been
as
a
biological
laboratory
for
experiments
involving
things
growing
in
a
environment
but
there
were
too
many
planets
like
that
already
when
men
first
traveled
to
the
stars
they
made
the
journey
because
it
was
starkly
necessary
to
find
new
worlds
for
men
to
live
on
earth
was
terribly
so
so
men
looked
for
new
worlds
to
move
to
they
found
plenty
of
new
worlds
but
presently
they
were
searching
desperately
for
new
worlds
where
life
had
preceded
them
it
did
matter
whether
the
life
was
meek
and
harmless
or
ferocious
and
deadly
if
life
of
any
sort
were
present
human
beings
could
move
in
but
highly
organized
beings
like
men
could
not
live
where
there
was
no
other
life
so
the
made
sure
that
the
world
had
no
life
upon
it
then
it
made
routine
measurements
of
the
gravitational
constant
and
the
magnetic
field
and
the
temperature
gradient
it
took
samples
of
the
air
and
water
but
that
was
all
the
rocks
were
familiar
enough
no
novelties
there
but
the
planet
was
simply
useless
the
put
its
findings
on
a
punched
card
six
inches
by
eight
and
went
hastily
on
in
search
of
something
better
the
ship
did
not
even
open
one
of
its
ports
while
on
the
planet
there
were
no
consequences
of
the
visit
except
that
card
none
whatever
no
other
ship
came
near
the
planet
for
eight
hundred
years
nearly
a
millenium
later
however
the
arrived
by
that
time
humanity
had
spread
very
widely
and
very
far
there
were
colonies
not
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
way
to
the
galaxy
rim
and
earth
was
no
longer
there
was
still
emigration
but
it
was
now
a
trickle
instead
of
the
swarming
flood
of
centuries
before
some
of
the
worlds
had
emigrants
now
mankind
did
not
want
to
crowd
itself
together
again
men
now
considered
that
there
was
no
excuse
for
such
monstrous
slums
as
overcrowding
produced
now
too
the
were
faster
a
hundred
was
a
short
journey
a
thousand
was
not
impractical
explorers
had
gone
many
times
farther
and
reported
worlds
still
waiting
for
mankind
on
beyond
but
still
the
great
majority
of
discovered
planets
did
not
contain
life
whole
solar
systems
floated
in
space
with
no
single
living
cell
on
any
of
their
members
so
the
came
into
being
theirs
was
not
a
glamorous
service
they
merely
methodically
contaminated
the
sterile
worlds
with
life
the
landed
on
this
planet
which
still
had
no
name
it
carefully
infected
it
it
circled
endlessly
above
the
clouds
dribbling
out
a
fine
dust
the
spores
of
every
conceivable
microörganism
which
could
break
down
rock
to
powder
and
turn
that
dust
to
soil
it
was
also
a
seeding
of
moulds
and
fungi
and
lichens
and
everything
which
could
turn
powdery
primitive
soil
into
stuff
on
which
higher
forms
of
life
could
grow
the
polluted
the
seas
with
plankton
then
it
too
went
away
more
centuries
passed
human
ships
again
improved
a
thousand
became
a
short
journey
explorers
reached
the
galaxy
very
edge
and
looked
estimatingly
across
the
emptiness
toward
other
island
universes
there
were
colonies
in
the
milky
way
there
were
between
and
the
commercial
center
of
human
affairs
shifted
some
hundreds
of
parsecs
toward
the
rim
there
were
many
worlds
where
the
schools
painstakingly
taught
the
children
what
earth
was
and
where
and
that
all
other
worlds
had
been
populated
from
it
and
the
schools
repeated
too
the
one
lesson
that
humankind
seemed
genuinely
to
have
learned
that
the
secret
of
peace
is
freedom
and
the
secret
of
freedom
is
to
be
able
to
move
away
from
people
with
whom
you
do
not
agree
there
were
no
crowded
worlds
any
more
but
human
beings
love
children
and
they
have
them
and
children
grow
up
and
need
room
so
more
worlds
had
to
be
looked
out
for
they
were
urgently
needed
yet
but
they
would
be
therefore
nearly
a
thousand
years
after
the
the
swam
to
the
planet
from
space
and
landed
on
it
it
was
a
gigantic
ship
of
highly
improbable
purpose
first
of
all
it
checked
on
the
consequences
of
the
visit
they
were
highly
satisfactory
from
a
technical
point
of
view
now
there
was
soil
which
swarmed
with
minute
living
things
there
were
fungi
which
throve
monstrously
the
seas
stank
of
minuscule
there
were
even
some
novelties
developed
by
the
strictly
local
conditions
there
were
for
example
paramoecia
as
big
as
grapes
and
yeasts
had
increased
in
size
until
they
bore
flowers
visible
to
the
naked
eye
the
life
on
the
planet
was
not
aboriginal
though
all
of
it
was
descended
and
adapted
and
modified
from
the
microörganisms
planted
by
the
whose
hulk
was
long
since
rust
and
whose
crew
were
merely
names
in
genealogies
if
that
the
stayed
on
the
planet
a
considerably
longer
time
than
either
of
the
ships
that
had
visited
it
before
it
dropped
the
seeds
of
plants
it
broadcast
innumerable
varieties
of
things
which
should
take
root
and
grow
in
some
places
it
deliberately
seeded
the
stinking
soil
it
put
marine
plants
in
the
oceans
it
put
alpine
plants
on
the
high
ground
and
when
all
its
stable
varieties
were
set
out
it
added
plants
which
were
genetically
unstable
for
generations
to
come
they
would
throw
sports
some
of
which
should
be
especially
suited
to
this
planetary
environment
before
it
left
the
dumped
finny
fish
into
the
seas
at
first
they
would
live
on
the
plankton
which
made
the
oceans
almost
broth
there
were
many
varieties
of
fish
some
would
multiply
swiftly
while
small
others
would
grow
and
feed
on
the
smaller
varieties
and
as
a
last
activity
the
set
up
loaded
with
some
would
release
their
contents
as
soon
as
plants
had
grown
enough
to
furnish
them
with
food
others
would
allow
their
contents
to
hatch
only
after
certain
other
varieties
had
multiplied
to
be
their
when
the
left
it
had
done
a
very
painstaking
job
it
had
treated
the
planet
to
a
sort
of
russell
mixture
of
the
real
russell
mixture
is
that
blend
of
the
simple
elements
in
the
proportions
found
in
suns
this
was
a
blend
of
in
which
some
should
survive
by
consuming
the
flora
others
by
preying
on
the
former
the
planet
was
stocked
in
effect
with
everything
that
it
could
be
hoped
would
live
there
but
only
certain
things
could
have
that
hope
nothing
which
needed
parental
care
had
any
chance
of
survival
the
creatures
seeded
at
this
time
had
to
be
those
which
could
care
for
themselves
from
the
instant
they
burst
their
eggs
so
there
were
no
birds
or
mammals
trees
and
plants
of
many
kinds
fish
and
crustaceans
and
tadpoles
and
all
kinds
of
insects
could
be
planted
but
nothing
else
the
swam
away
through
emptiness
there
should
have
been
another
planting
centuries
later
there
should
have
been
a
ship
from
the
zoölogical
branch
of
the
ecological
service
it
should
have
landed
birds
and
beasts
and
reptiles
it
should
have
added
pelagic
mammals
to
the
seas
there
should
have
been
herbivorous
animals
to
live
on
the
grasses
and
plants
which
would
have
thriven
and
carnivorous
animals
to
live
on
them
in
turn
there
should
have
been
careful
stocking
of
the
planet
with
animal
life
and
repeated
visits
at
intervals
of
a
century
or
so
to
make
sure
that
a
true
ecological
balance
had
been
established
and
then
when
the
balance
was
fixed
men
would
come
and
destroy
it
for
their
own
benefit
but
there
was
an
accident
ships
had
improved
again
even
small
private
now
journeyed
tens
of
on
holiday
journeys
personal
cruisers
traveled
hundreds
liners
ran
on
tens
of
thousands
of
long
an
was
on
its
way
to
a
second
island
universe
it
did
not
come
back
the
inhabited
planets
were
all
members
of
a
tenuous
organization
which
limited
itself
to
affairs
of
space
without
attempting
to
interfere
in
surface
matters
that
tenuous
organization
moved
the
ecological
preparation
service
files
to
algol
iv
as
a
matter
of
convenience
in
the
moving
a
was
upset
the
cards
it
contained
were
picked
up
and
replaced
but
one
was
missed
it
was
not
picked
up
it
was
left
behind
so
the
planet
which
had
no
name
was
forgotten
no
other
ship
came
to
prepare
it
for
ultimate
human
occupancy
it
circled
its
sun
unheeded
and
covered
it
from
pole
to
pole
there
were
hazy
markings
in
some
places
where
high
plateaus
penetrated
its
clouds
but
that
was
all
from
space
the
planet
was
essentially
featureless
seen
from
afar
it
was
merely
a
round
white
ball
white
from
its
and
nothing
else
but
on
its
surface
on
its
lowlands
it
was
pure
nightmare
but
this
fact
did
not
matter
for
a
very
long
time
ultimately
it
mattered
a
great
deal
to
the
crew
of
the
the
was
a
splendid
ship
of
its
time
it
bore
passengers
headed
for
one
of
the
galaxy
spiral
arms
and
it
cut
across
the
normal
lanes
and
headed
through
charted
but
unvisited
parts
of
the
galaxy
toward
its
destination
and
it
had
one
of
the
very
very
very
few
accidents
known
to
happen
to
licensed
for
travel
off
the
normal
it
suffered
shipwreck
in
space
and
its
passengers
and
crew
were
forced
to
take
to
the
the
lifeboats
range
was
limited
they
landed
on
the
planet
that
the
had
first
examined
that
the
and
the
had
seeded
and
of
which
there
was
no
longer
any
record
in
the
of
the
ecological
service
their
fuel
was
exhausted
they
could
not
leave
they
could
not
signal
for
help
they
had
to
stay
there
and
the
planet
was
a
place
of
nightmares
after
a
time
the
few
people
some
few
thousands
who
knew
that
there
was
a
named
gave
it
up
for
lost
they
forgot
about
it
everybody
forgot
even
the
passengers
and
crew
of
the
ship
forgot
it
not
immediately
of
course
for
the
first
few
generations
their
descendants
cherished
hopes
of
rescue
but
the
planet
which
had
no
name
the
forgotten
planet
did
not
encourage
the
cherishing
of
hope
after
generations
nobody
remembered
the
anywhere
the
wreckage
of
the
lifeboats
was
long
since
hidden
under
the
seething
furiously
striving
fungi
of
the
soil
the
human
beings
had
forgotten
not
only
their
ancestors
ship
but
very
nearly
everything
their
ancestors
had
brought
to
this
world
the
use
of
metals
the
existence
of
fire
and
even
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
sunshine
they
lived
in
the
lowlands
deep
under
the
amid
surroundings
which
were
riotous
swarming
frenzied
horror
they
had
become
savages
they
were
less
than
savages
because
they
had
forgotten
their
destiny
as
men
mad
in
all
his
lifetime
of
perhaps
twenty
years
it
had
never
occurred
to
burl
to
wonder
what
his
grandfather
had
thought
about
his
surroundings
the
grandfather
had
come
to
an
untimely
end
in
a
fashion
which
burl
remembered
as
a
succession
of
screams
coming
more
and
more
faintly
to
his
ears
while
he
was
being
carried
away
at
the
topmost
speed
of
which
his
mother
was
capable
burl
had
rarely
or
never
thought
of
his
grandfather
since
surely
he
had
never
wondered
what
his
had
thought
and
most
surely
of
all
he
never
speculated
upon
what
his
had
thought
when
his
lifeboat
landed
from
the
burl
had
never
heard
of
the
he
had
done
very
little
thinking
of
any
sort
when
he
did
think
it
was
mostly
agonized
effort
to
contrive
a
way
to
escape
some
immediate
and
paralyzing
danger
when
horror
did
not
press
upon
him
it
was
better
not
to
think
because
there
was
much
but
horror
to
think
about
at
the
moment
he
was
treading
cautiously
over
a
brownish
carpet
of
fungus
creeping
furtively
toward
the
stream
which
he
knew
only
by
the
generic
name
of
water
it
was
the
only
water
he
knew
towering
far
above
his
head
three
high
great
toadstools
hid
the
gray
sky
from
his
sight
clinging
to
the
stalks
of
the
toadstools
were
still
other
fungi
parasites
upon
the
growths
that
once
had
been
parasites
themselves
burl
appeared
a
fairly
representative
specimen
of
the
descendants
of
the
crew
he
wore
a
single
garment
twisted
about
his
middle
made
from
the
of
a
great
moth
which
the
members
of
his
tribe
had
slain
as
it
emerged
from
its
cocoon
his
skin
was
fair
without
a
trace
of
sunburn
in
all
his
lifetime
he
had
never
seen
the
sun
though
he
surely
had
seen
the
sky
often
enough
it
was
rarely
hidden
from
him
save
by
giant
fungi
like
those
about
him
now
and
sometimes
by
the
gigantic
cabbages
which
were
nearly
the
only
green
growths
he
knew
to
him
normal
landscape
contained
only
fantastic
pallid
mosses
and
misshapen
fungus
growths
and
colossal
moulds
and
yeasts
he
moved
onward
despite
his
caution
his
shoulder
once
touched
a
toadstool
stalk
giving
the
whole
fungus
a
tiny
shock
instantly
a
fine
and
impalpable
powder
fell
upon
him
from
the
umbrella
like
top
above
it
was
the
season
when
the
toadstools
sent
out
their
spores
he
paused
to
brush
them
from
his
head
and
shoulders
they
were
of
course
deadly
poison
burl
knew
such
matters
with
an
immediate
and
specific
and
detailed
certainty
he
knew
practically
nothing
else
he
was
ignorant
of
the
use
of
fire
of
metals
and
even
of
the
uses
of
stone
and
wood
his
language
was
a
scanty
group
of
a
few
hundred
labial
sounds
conveying
no
abstractions
and
few
concrete
ideas
he
knew
nothing
of
wood
because
there
was
no
wood
in
the
territory
furtively
inhabited
by
his
tribe
this
was
the
lowlands
trees
did
not
thrive
here
not
even
grasses
and
could
compete
with
mushrooms
and
toadstools
and
their
kin
here
was
a
soil
of
rusts
and
yeasts
here
were
toadstool
forests
and
fungus
jungles
they
grew
with
feverish
intensity
beneath
a
sky
while
above
them
fluttered
butterflies
no
less
enlarged
than
they
moths
as
much
magnified
and
other
creatures
which
could
thrive
on
their
corruption
the
only
creatures
on
the
planet
which
crawled
or
ran
or
flew
save
only
burl
fugitive
kind
were
insects
they
had
been
here
before
men
came
and
they
had
adapted
to
the
planet
extraordinary
ways
with
a
world
made
ready
before
their
first
progenitors
arrived
insects
had
thriven
incredibly
with
unlimited
they
had
grown
large
with
increased
size
had
come
increased
opportunity
for
survival
and
enlargement
became
hereditary
other
than
fungoid
growths
the
solitary
vegetables
were
the
sports
of
unstable
varieties
of
the
plants
left
behind
by
the
there
were
enormous
cabbages
with
leaves
the
size
of
on
which
stolid
grubs
and
caterpillars
ate
themselves
to
maturity
and
then
swung
below
in
strong
cocoons
to
sleep
the
sleep
of
metamorphosis
the
tiniest
butterflies
of
earth
had
increased
their
size
here
until
their
wings
spread
feet
across
and
some
like
the
emperor
moths
stretched
out
purple
wings
which
were
yards
in
span
burl
himself
would
have
been
dwarfed
beneath
a
great
moth
wing
but
he
wore
a
gaudy
fabric
made
of
one
the
moths
and
giant
butterflies
were
harmless
to
men
burl
fellow
tribesmen
sometimes
came
upon
a
cocoon
when
it
was
just
about
to
open
and
if
they
dared
they
waited
timorously
beside
it
until
the
creature
inside
broke
through
its
and
came
out
into
the
light
then
before
it
gathered
energy
from
the
air
and
before
its
wings
swelled
to
strength
and
firmness
the
tribesmen
fell
upon
it
they
tore
the
delicate
wings
from
its
body
and
the
limbs
from
their
places
and
when
it
lay
helpless
before
them
they
fled
away
to
feast
on
its
juicy
limbs
they
dared
not
linger
of
course
they
left
their
prey
helpless
staring
strangely
at
the
world
about
it
through
its
eyes
before
the
scavengers
came
to
contest
its
ownership
if
nothing
more
deadly
appeared
surely
the
ants
would
come
some
of
them
were
only
inches
long
but
others
were
the
size
of
all
of
them
had
to
be
avoided
by
men
they
would
carry
the
away
to
their
underground
cities
triumphantly
in
shreds
and
morsels
but
most
of
the
insect
world
was
neither
so
helpless
nor
so
unthreatening
burl
knew
of
wasps
almost
the
length
of
his
own
body
with
stings
that
were
instantly
fatal
to
every
species
of
wasp
however
some
other
insect
is
predestined
prey
wasps
need
not
be
dreaded
too
much
and
bees
were
similarly
aloof
they
were
hard
put
to
it
for
existence
those
bees
since
few
flowers
bloomed
they
were
reduced
to
expedients
that
once
were
considered
signs
of
degeneracy
in
their
race
bubbling
yeasts
and
fouler
things
or
occasionally
the
nectarless
blooms
of
the
rank
giant
cabbages
burl
knew
the
bees
they
droned
overhead
nearly
as
large
as
he
was
their
bulging
eyes
gazing
at
him
and
everything
else
in
abstracted
preoccupation
there
were
crickets
and
beetles
and
spiders
burl
knew
spiders
his
grandfather
had
been
the
prey
of
a
hunting
tarantula
which
had
leaped
with
incredible
ferocity
from
its
tunnel
in
the
ground
a
vertical
pit
a
yard
in
diameter
went
down
for
twenty
feet
at
the
bottom
of
the
lair
the
monster
waited
for
the
tiny
sounds
that
would
warn
him
of
prey
approaching
his
burl
grandfather
had
been
careless
the
terrible
shrieks
he
uttered
as
he
was
seized
still
lingered
vaguely
in
burl
mind
and
he
had
seen
too
the
webs
of
another
species
of
spider
cables
of
dirty
silk
and
watched
from
a
safe
distance
as
the
misshapen
monster
sucked
the
juices
from
a
cricket
its
trap
had
caught
he
remembered
the
stripes
of
yellow
and
black
and
silver
that
crossed
upon
its
abdomen
he
had
been
fascinated
and
horrified
by
the
blind
struggling
of
the
cricket
tangled
in
hopeless
coils
of
gummy
cord
before
the
spider
began
its
feast
burl
knew
these
dangers
they
were
part
of
his
life
it
was
this
knowledge
that
made
life
possible
he
knew
the
ways
to
evade
these
dangers
but
if
he
yielded
to
carelessness
for
one
moment
or
if
he
relaxed
his
caution
for
one
instant
he
would
be
one
with
his
ancestors
they
were
the
meals
of
inhuman
monsters
now
to
be
sure
burl
moved
upon
an
errand
that
probably
no
other
of
his
tribe
would
have
imagined
the
day
before
he
had
crouched
behind
a
shapeless
mound
of
growths
and
watched
a
duel
between
two
huge
horned
beetles
their
bodies
were
feet
long
their
carapaces
were
to
burl
when
they
crawled
their
mandibles
gaping
laterally
clicked
and
clashed
upon
each
other
impenetrable
armor
their
legs
crashed
like
so
many
cymbals
as
they
struck
against
each
other
they
fought
over
some
particularly
attractive
bit
of
carrion
burl
had
watched
with
wide
eyes
until
a
gaping
hole
appeared
in
the
armor
of
the
smaller
one
it
uttered
a
grating
outcry
or
seemed
to
the
noise
was
actually
the
tearing
of
its
shell
between
the
mandibles
of
the
victor
the
wounded
creature
struggled
more
and
more
feebly
when
it
ceased
to
offer
battle
the
conqueror
placidly
began
to
dine
before
its
prey
had
ceased
to
live
but
this
was
the
custom
of
creatures
on
this
planet
burl
watched
timorous
but
hopeful
when
the
meal
was
finished
he
darted
in
quickly
as
the
diner
lumbered
away
he
was
almost
too
late
even
then
an
ant
the
forerunner
of
many
already
inspected
the
fragments
with
excitedly
vibrating
antennae
burl
needed
to
move
quickly
and
he
did
ants
were
stupid
and
insects
few
of
them
were
hunters
save
when
offered
battle
most
of
them
were
scavengers
only
they
hunted
the
scenes
of
nightmare
for
the
dead
and
dying
only
but
fought
viciously
if
their
prey
were
questioned
and
always
there
were
others
on
the
way
some
were
arriving
now
hearing
the
tiny
clickings
of
their
approach
burl
was
hasty
he
seized
a
loosened
fragment
and
fled
it
was
merely
the
horn
the
snout
of
the
dead
and
eaten
creature
but
it
was
loose
and
easily
carried
he
ran
later
he
inspected
his
find
with
disappointment
there
was
little
meat
clinging
to
it
it
was
merely
the
horn
of
a
minotaur
beetle
shaped
like
the
horn
of
a
rhinoceros
plucking
out
the
shreds
left
by
its
murderer
he
pricked
his
hand
pettishly
he
flung
it
aside
the
time
of
darkness
was
near
so
he
crept
to
the
hiding
place
of
his
tribe
to
huddle
with
them
until
light
came
again
there
were
only
twenty
of
them
four
or
five
men
and
six
or
seven
women
the
rest
were
girls
or
children
burl
had
been
wondering
at
the
strange
feelings
that
came
over
him
when
he
looked
at
one
of
the
girls
she
was
younger
than
burl
perhaps
eighteen
and
fleeter
of
foot
they
talked
together
sometimes
and
once
or
twice
burl
shared
an
especially
succulent
find
of
foodstuffs
with
her
he
could
share
nothing
with
her
now
she
stared
at
him
in
the
deepening
night
when
he
crept
to
the
labyrinthine
hiding
place
the
tribe
now
used
in
a
mushroom
forest
he
considered
that
she
looked
hungry
and
hoped
that
he
would
have
food
to
share
and
he
was
bitterly
ashamed
that
he
could
offer
nothing
he
held
himself
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
because
of
his
shame
since
he
too
was
hungry
it
was
some
time
before
he
slept
then
he
dreamed
next
morning
he
found
the
horn
where
he
had
thrown
it
disgustedly
the
day
before
it
was
sticking
in
the
flabby
trunk
of
a
toadstool
he
pulled
it
out
in
his
dream
he
had
used
it
presently
he
tried
to
use
it
sometimes
not
often
the
men
of
the
tribe
used
the
edge
of
a
or
the
leg
of
a
grasshopper
to
sever
tough
portions
of
an
edible
mushroom
the
horn
had
no
cutting
edge
but
burl
had
used
it
in
his
dream
he
was
not
quite
capable
of
distinguishing
clearly
between
reality
and
dreams
so
he
tried
to
duplicate
what
happened
in
the
dream
remembering
that
it
had
stuck
into
the
he
thrust
it
it
stabbed
he
remembered
distinctly
how
the
larger
beetle
had
used
its
horn
as
a
weapon
it
had
stabbed
too
he
considered
absorbedly
he
could
not
imagine
himself
fighting
one
of
the
dangerous
insects
of
course
men
did
not
fight
on
the
forgotten
planet
they
ran
away
they
hid
but
somehow
burl
formed
a
fantastic
picture
of
himself
stabbing
food
with
this
horn
as
he
had
stabbed
a
mushroom
it
was
longer
than
his
arm
and
though
naturally
clumsy
in
his
hand
it
would
have
been
a
deadly
weapon
in
the
grip
of
a
man
prepared
to
do
battle
battle
did
not
occur
to
burl
but
the
idea
of
stabbing
food
with
it
was
clear
there
could
be
food
that
would
not
fight
back
presently
he
had
an
inspiration
his
face
brightened
he
began
to
make
his
way
toward
the
tiny
river
that
ran
across
the
plain
in
which
the
tribe
of
humans
lived
by
foraging
in
competition
with
the
ants
newts
big
enough
to
be
lusted
for
swam
in
its
waters
the
swimming
larvae
of
a
thousand
kinds
of
creatures
floated
on
the
sluggish
surface
or
crawled
over
the
bottom
there
were
deadly
things
there
too
giant
crayfish
snapped
their
claws
at
the
unwary
one
of
them
could
sever
burl
arm
with
ease
mosquitoes
sometimes
hummed
high
above
the
river
mosquitoes
had
a
now
though
they
were
dying
out
for
lack
of
on
which
the
males
of
their
species
fed
but
they
were
formidable
burl
had
learned
to
crush
them
between
fragments
of
fungus
he
crept
slowly
through
the
forest
of
toadstools
what
should
have
been
grass
underfoot
was
brownish
rust
orange
and
red
and
purple
moulds
clustered
about
the
bases
of
the
creamy
once
burl
paused
to
run
his
weapon
through
a
fleshy
column
and
reassure
himself
that
what
he
planned
was
possible
he
made
his
way
furtively
through
the
bulbous
growths
once
he
heard
clickings
and
froze
to
stillness
four
or
five
ants
minims
only
eight
inches
long
were
returning
by
an
habitual
pathway
to
their
city
they
moved
sturdily
along
heavily
laden
over
the
route
marked
by
the
scent
of
formic
acid
left
by
their
burl
waited
until
they
had
passed
then
went
on
he
came
to
the
bank
of
the
river
it
flowed
slowly
green
scum
covering
a
great
deal
of
its
surface
in
the
backwaters
occasionally
broken
by
a
slowly
enlarging
bubble
released
from
decomposing
matter
on
the
bottom
in
the
center
of
the
stream
the
current
ran
a
little
more
swiftly
and
the
water
itself
seemed
clear
over
it
ran
many
they
had
not
shared
in
the
general
increase
of
size
in
the
insect
world
depending
as
they
did
on
the
surface
tension
of
the
water
for
support
to
have
grown
larger
and
heavier
would
have
destroyed
them
burl
surveyed
the
scene
his
search
was
four
parts
for
danger
and
only
one
part
for
a
way
to
test
his
brilliant
notion
but
that
was
natural
where
he
stood
the
green
scum
covered
the
stream
for
many
yards
a
little
though
the
current
came
closer
to
the
bank
here
he
could
not
see
whatever
swam
or
crawled
or
wriggled
underwater
there
he
might
there
was
an
outcropping
rock
forming
a
support
for
crawling
stuff
which
in
turn
supported
making
wide
steps
almost
down
to
the
water
edge
burl
was
making
his
way
cautiously
toward
them
when
he
saw
one
of
the
edible
mushrooms
which
formed
so
large
a
part
of
his
diet
he
paused
to
break
off
a
flabby
white
piece
large
enough
to
feed
him
for
many
days
it
was
the
custom
of
his
people
when
they
found
a
store
of
food
to
hide
with
it
and
not
venture
out
again
to
danger
until
it
was
all
eaten
burl
was
tempted
to
do
just
that
with
his
booty
he
could
give
saya
of
this
food
and
they
would
eat
together
they
might
hide
together
until
it
was
all
consumed
but
there
was
a
swirling
in
the
water
under
the
descending
platforms
of
a
very
remarkable
sensation
came
to
burl
he
may
have
been
the
only
man
in
many
generations
to
be
aware
of
the
high
ambition
to
stab
something
to
eat
he
may
have
been
a
to
ancestors
who
had
known
bravery
which
had
no
here
but
burl
had
imagined
carrying
saya
food
which
he
had
stabbed
with
the
spear
of
a
minotaur
beetle
it
was
an
extraordinary
idea
it
was
new
too
not
too
long
ago
when
he
was
younger
burl
would
have
thought
of
the
tribe
instead
he
have
thought
of
old
jon
and
wheezing
and
timorous
and
how
that
patriarch
would
pat
his
arm
exuberantly
when
handed
food
or
old
tama
wrinkled
and
querulous
whose
look
of
settled
dissatisfaction
would
vanish
at
sight
of
a
tidbit
of
dik
and
tet
the
next
younger
who
would
squabble
zestfully
over
the
fragments
allotted
them
but
now
he
imagined
saya
looking
astonished
and
glad
when
he
grandly
handed
her
more
food
than
she
could
possibly
eat
she
would
admire
him
enormously
of
course
he
did
not
imagine
himself
fighting
to
get
food
for
saya
he
meant
only
to
stab
something
edible
in
the
water
things
in
the
water
did
not
fight
things
on
land
since
he
would
not
be
in
the
water
he
would
not
be
in
a
fight
it
was
a
completely
delectable
idea
which
no
man
within
memory
had
ever
entertained
before
if
burl
accomplished
it
his
tribe
would
admire
him
saya
would
admire
him
everybody
observing
that
he
had
found
a
new
source
of
food
would
even
envy
him
until
he
showed
them
how
to
do
it
too
burl
were
preoccupied
with
the
filling
of
their
stomachs
the
preservation
of
their
lives
came
second
the
perpetuation
of
the
race
came
a
bad
third
in
their
consideration
they
were
herded
together
in
a
leaderless
group
coming
to
the
same
nightly
only
that
they
might
share
the
finds
of
the
lucky
and
gather
comfort
from
their
numbers
they
had
no
weapons
even
burl
did
not
consider
his
spear
a
weapon
it
was
a
tool
for
stabbing
something
to
eat
only
yet
he
did
not
think
of
it
in
that
way
exactly
his
tribe
did
not
even
consciously
use
tools
sometimes
they
used
stones
to
crack
open
the
limbs
of
great
insects
they
found
incompletely
devoured
they
did
not
even
carry
rocks
about
with
them
for
that
purpose
only
burl
had
a
vague
idea
of
taking
something
to
some
place
to
do
something
with
it
it
was
unprecedented
burl
was
at
least
an
atavar
he
may
have
been
a
genius
but
he
was
not
a
genius
certainly
not
yet
he
reached
a
spot
from
which
he
could
look
down
into
the
water
he
looked
behind
and
all
about
listening
then
lay
down
to
stare
into
the
shallow
depths
once
a
huge
crayfish
a
good
eight
feet
long
moved
leisurely
across
his
vision
small
fishes
and
even
huge
newts
fled
before
it
after
a
long
time
the
normal
course
of
underwater
life
resumed
the
wriggling
in
their
quaintly
ambitious
houses
reappeared
little
flecks
of
silver
swam
into
view
a
school
of
tiny
fish
then
a
larger
fish
appeared
moving
slowly
in
the
stream
burl
eyes
glistened
his
mouth
watered
he
reached
down
with
his
long
weapon
it
barely
broke
through
the
still
surface
of
the
water
below
disappointment
filled
him
yet
the
nearness
and
apparent
probability
of
success
spurred
him
on
he
examined
the
beneath
him
rising
he
moved
to
a
point
above
them
and
tested
one
with
his
spear
it
resisted
burl
felt
about
tentatively
with
his
foot
then
dared
to
put
his
whole
weight
on
the
topmost
it
held
firmly
he
clambered
down
upon
the
lower
ones
then
lay
flat
and
peered
over
the
edge
the
large
fish
fully
as
long
as
burl
arm
swam
slowly
to
and
fro
beneath
him
burl
had
seen
the
former
owner
of
this
spear
strive
to
thrust
it
into
his
adversary
the
beetle
had
been
killed
by
the
more
successful
stab
of
a
similar
weapon
burl
had
tried
this
upon
toadstools
practising
with
it
when
the
silver
fish
drifted
close
by
again
he
thrust
sharply
downward
the
spear
seemed
to
bend
when
it
entered
the
water
it
missed
its
mark
by
inches
much
to
burl
astonishment
he
tried
again
once
more
the
spear
seemed
diverted
by
the
water
he
grew
angry
with
the
fish
for
eluding
his
efforts
to
kill
it
this
anger
was
as
much
the
reaction
of
a
to
a
less
fearful
time
as
the
idea
of
killing
itself
but
burl
scowled
at
the
fish
repeated
strokes
had
left
it
untouched
it
was
unwary
it
did
not
even
swim
away
then
it
came
to
rest
directly
beneath
his
hand
he
thrust
directly
downward
with
all
his
strength
this
time
the
spear
entering
vertically
did
not
appear
to
bend
but
went
straight
down
its
point
penetrated
the
scales
of
the
swimming
fish
transfixing
the
creature
completely
an
uproar
began
with
the
fish
wriggling
desperately
as
burl
tried
to
draw
it
up
to
his
perch
in
his
excitement
he
did
not
notice
a
tiny
ripple
a
little
distance
away
the
monster
crayfish
attracted
by
the
disturbance
was
coming
back
the
unequal
combat
continued
burl
hung
on
desperately
to
the
end
of
his
spear
then
there
was
a
tremor
in
the
on
which
he
lay
it
yielded
collapsed
and
fell
into
the
stream
with
a
mighty
splash
burl
went
under
his
eyes
wide
open
facing
death
as
he
sank
he
saw
the
gaping
horrible
claws
of
the
crustacean
huge
enough
to
sever
any
of
burl
limbs
with
a
single
snap
he
opened
his
mouth
to
scream
but
no
sound
came
out
only
bubbles
floated
up
to
the
surface
he
beat
the
unresisting
fluid
in
a
frenzy
of
horror
with
his
hands
and
feet
as
the
colossal
crayfish
leisurely
approached
his
arms
struck
a
solid
object
he
clutched
it
convulsively
a
second
later
he
had
swung
it
between
himself
and
the
crustacean
he
felt
the
shock
as
the
claws
closed
upon
the
fungus
then
he
felt
himself
drawn
upward
as
the
crayfish
disgustedly
released
its
hold
and
the
floated
slowly
upward
having
given
way
beneath
him
it
had
been
pushed
below
when
he
fell
only
to
rise
within
his
reach
just
when
most
needed
burl
head
popped
and
he
saw
a
larger
bit
of
the
fungus
floating
nearby
even
less
securely
anchored
to
the
than
the
shelf
to
which
he
had
trusted
himself
it
had
broken
away
when
he
fell
it
was
larger
and
floated
higher
he
seized
it
crazily
trying
to
climb
up
it
tilted
under
his
weight
and
very
nearly
overturned
he
paid
no
heed
with
desperate
haste
he
clawed
and
kicked
until
he
could
draw
himself
clear
of
the
water
as
he
pulled
himself
up
on
the
furry
surface
a
sharp
blow
struck
his
foot
the
crayfish
disappointed
at
finding
nothing
tasty
in
the
had
made
a
languid
stroke
at
burl
foot
wriggling
in
the
water
failing
to
grasp
the
fleshy
member
it
went
annoyedly
away
burl
floated
downstream
perched
weaponless
and
alone
upon
a
flimsy
raft
of
degenerate
fungus
floated
slowly
down
a
stagnant
river
in
which
death
swam
between
banks
of
sheer
peril
past
long
reaches
above
which
death
floated
on
golden
wings
it
was
a
long
while
before
he
recovered
his
then
and
this
was
an
action
individual
in
burl
none
of
his
tribesmen
would
have
thought
of
it
he
looked
for
his
spear
it
was
floating
in
the
water
still
transfixing
the
fish
whose
capture
had
brought
him
to
this
present
predicament
that
silvery
shape
so
violent
before
now
floated
all
life
gone
burl
mouth
watered
as
he
gazed
at
the
fish
he
kept
it
in
view
constantly
while
the
unsteady
craft
spun
slowly
downstream
in
the
current
lying
flat
he
tried
to
reach
out
and
grasp
the
end
of
the
spear
when
it
circled
toward
him
the
raft
tilted
nearly
capsizing
a
little
later
he
discovered
that
it
sank
more
readily
on
one
side
than
the
other
this
was
due
of
course
to
the
greater
thickness
of
one
side
the
part
next
to
the
had
been
thicker
and
was
therefore
more
buoyant
he
lay
with
his
head
above
that
side
of
the
raft
it
did
not
sink
into
the
water
wriggling
as
far
to
the
edge
as
he
dared
he
reached
out
and
out
he
waited
impatiently
for
the
slower
rotation
of
his
float
to
coincide
with
the
faster
motion
of
the
speared
fish
the
came
closer
and
closer
he
reached
out
and
the
raft
dipped
dangerously
but
his
fingers
touched
the
he
got
a
precarious
hold
pulled
it
toward
him
seconds
later
he
was
tearing
strips
of
scaly
flesh
from
the
side
of
the
fish
and
cramming
the
greasy
stuff
into
his
mouth
with
vast
enjoyment
he
had
lost
the
edible
mushroom
it
floated
several
yards
away
he
ate
contentedly
he
thought
of
the
tribesfolk
as
he
ate
this
was
more
than
he
could
finish
alone
old
tama
would
coax
him
avidly
for
more
than
her
share
she
had
a
few
teeth
left
she
would
remind
him
anxiously
of
her
gifts
of
food
to
him
when
he
was
younger
dik
and
tet
being
boys
would
clamorously
demand
of
him
where
he
gotten
it
how
he
would
give
some
to
cori
who
had
younger
children
and
she
would
give
them
most
of
the
gift
and
saya
burl
gloated
especially
over
saya
certain
reaction
then
he
realized
that
with
every
second
he
was
being
carried
further
away
from
her
the
nearer
moved
past
him
he
could
tell
by
the
motion
of
the
vividly
colored
growths
upon
the
shore
overhead
the
sun
was
merely
a
brighter
patch
in
the
sky
in
the
pinkish
light
all
about
burl
looked
for
the
familiar
and
did
not
find
it
and
dolefully
knew
that
he
was
remote
from
saya
and
going
farther
all
the
time
there
were
a
multitude
of
flying
objects
to
be
seen
in
the
miasmatic
air
in
the
daytime
a
thin
mist
always
hung
above
the
lowlands
burl
had
never
seen
any
object
as
much
as
three
miles
distant
the
air
was
never
clear
enough
to
permit
it
but
there
was
much
to
be
seen
even
within
the
limiting
mist
now
and
then
a
cricket
or
a
grasshopper
made
its
flight
from
one
spot
to
another
huge
butterflies
fluttered
gaily
above
the
silent
loathesome
ground
bees
lumbered
anxiously
about
seeking
the
flowers
of
the
giant
cabbages
which
grew
so
rarely
occasionally
a
wasp
flashed
swiftly
by
but
burl
did
not
heed
any
of
them
sitting
dismally
upon
his
fungus
raft
floating
in
midstream
an
incongruous
figure
of
pink
skin
and
with
a
greasy
dead
fish
beside
him
he
was
filled
with
a
panicky
anguish
because
the
river
carried
him
away
from
the
one
girl
of
his
tiny
tribe
whose
glances
roused
a
commotion
in
his
breast
the
day
wore
on
once
he
saw
a
band
of
large
amazon
ants
moving
briskly
over
a
carpet
of
mould
to
raid
the
city
of
a
species
of
black
ants
the
eggs
they
would
carry
away
from
the
city
would
hatch
and
the
small
black
creatures
would
become
the
slaves
of
the
brigands
who
had
stolen
them
later
swollen
branches
drifted
slowly
into
view
they
were
outlined
sharply
against
the
steaming
mist
behind
them
he
knew
what
they
were
a
fungus
growing
upon
itself
in
peculiar
mockery
of
the
trees
which
burl
had
never
seen
because
no
trees
could
survive
the
conditions
of
the
lowland
much
later
as
the
day
drew
to
an
end
burl
ate
again
of
the
oily
fish
the
taste
was
pleasant
compared
to
the
insipid
mushrooms
he
usually
ate
even
though
he
stuffed
himself
the
fish
was
so
large
that
the
greater
part
remained
still
uneaten
the
spear
was
beside
him
although
it
had
brought
him
trouble
he
still
associated
it
with
the
food
it
had
secured
rather
than
the
difficulty
into
which
it
had
led
him
when
he
had
eaten
his
fill
he
picked
it
up
to
examine
again
the
point
remained
as
sharp
as
before
not
daring
to
use
it
again
from
so
unsteady
a
raft
he
set
it
aside
as
he
stripped
a
sinew
from
his
to
hang
the
fish
around
his
neck
this
would
leave
his
arms
free
then
he
sat
fumbling
with
the
spear
as
he
watched
the
shores
go
past
a
man
it
was
near
to
sunset
burl
had
never
seen
the
sun
so
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
think
of
the
coming
of
night
as
the
setting
of
anything
to
him
it
was
the
letting
down
of
darkness
from
the
sky
the
process
was
invariable
overhead
there
was
always
a
thick
and
unbroken
bank
of
vapor
which
seemed
featureless
until
sunset
then
toward
the
west
the
brightness
overhead
turned
orange
and
then
pink
while
to
the
east
it
simply
faded
to
a
deeper
gray
as
nightfall
progressed
the
red
colorings
grew
deeper
moving
toward
ultimately
scattered
blotches
of
darkness
began
to
spot
that
reddening
sky
as
it
grew
darker
in
tone
going
down
toward
that
impossible
redness
which
is
indistinguishable
from
black
it
was
slowly
achieving
that
redness
today
burl
watched
as
never
before
on
the
oily
surface
of
the
river
the
colors
and
shadings
of
dusk
were
reflected
with
incredible
faithfulness
the
round
tops
of
toadstools
along
the
shore
glowed
pink
dragonflies
glinted
in
swift
and
angular
flight
the
metallic
sheen
of
their
bodies
flashing
in
the
redness
great
yellow
butterflies
sailed
lightly
above
the
stream
in
every
direction
upon
the
water
appeared
the
boats
of
a
thousand
floating
at
the
surface
while
they
might
burl
could
have
thrust
his
hand
down
into
their
cavities
to
seize
the
white
worms
nesting
there
the
bulk
of
a
tardy
bee
droned
heavily
overhead
he
saw
the
long
proboscis
and
the
hairy
with
their
scanty
load
of
pollen
the
great
eyes
held
an
expression
of
stupid
preoccupation
the
crimson
radiance
grew
dim
and
the
color
overhead
faded
toward
black
now
the
stalks
of
ten
thousand
domed
mushrooms
lined
the
beneath
them
spread
fungi
of
all
colors
from
the
rawest
red
to
palest
blue
now
all
fading
slowly
to
a
monochromatic
background
as
the
darkness
deepened
the
buzzing
and
fluttering
and
flapping
of
the
insects
of
the
day
died
down
from
a
million
hiding
places
there
crept
out
into
the
night
the
soft
and
furry
bodies
of
great
moths
who
preened
themselves
and
smoothed
their
feathery
antennae
before
taking
to
the
air
the
crickets
set
up
their
thunderous
noise
grown
gravely
bass
with
the
increasing
size
of
the
organs
then
there
began
to
gather
on
the
water
those
slender
spirals
of
deeper
mist
which
would
presently
blanket
the
stream
in
fog
night
arrived
the
clouds
above
grew
wholly
black
gradually
the
languid
fall
of
large
warm
raindrops
they
would
fall
all
through
the
night
began
the
edge
of
the
stream
became
a
place
where
disks
of
cold
blue
flame
appeared
the
mushrooms
on
the
river
bank
were
faintly
phosphorescent
shedding
a
ghostly
light
over
the
ground
below
them
here
and
there
lambent
chilly
flames
appeared
in
drifting
idly
above
the
festering
earth
on
other
planets
men
call
them
but
on
this
planet
mankind
had
no
name
for
them
at
all
then
huge
pulsating
glows
appeared
in
the
blackness
fireflies
that
burl
knew
to
be
as
long
as
his
spear
they
glided
slowly
through
the
darkness
over
the
stream
shedding
intermittent
light
over
burl
crouched
on
his
drifting
raft
on
the
shore
too
tiny
paired
lights
glowed
eagerly
upward
as
the
wingless
females
of
the
species
crawled
to
where
their
signals
could
be
seen
and
there
were
other
glowing
things
burned
in
the
night
consuming
nothing
even
the
water
of
the
river
glowed
with
marine
organisms
adapted
to
fresh
water
here
contributing
their
mites
of
brilliance
the
air
was
full
of
flying
creatures
the
beat
of
invisible
wings
came
through
the
night
above
about
on
every
side
the
swarming
feverish
life
of
the
insect
world
went
on
ceaselessly
while
burl
rocked
back
and
forth
upon
his
unstable
raft
wanting
to
weep
because
he
was
being
carried
farther
away
from
saya
whom
he
could
picture
looking
for
him
now
among
the
hidden
furtive
members
of
the
tribe
about
him
sounded
the
discordant
mating
cries
of
creatures
trying
to
serve
life
in
the
midst
of
death
and
the
horrible
noises
of
those
who
met
death
and
were
devoured
in
the
dark
burl
was
accustomed
to
such
tumult
but
he
was
not
accustomed
to
such
despair
as
he
felt
at
being
lost
from
saya
of
the
swift
feet
and
white
teeth
and
shy
smile
he
lay
disconsolate
on
his
bobbing
craft
for
the
greater
part
of
the
night
it
was
long
past
midnight
when
the
raft
struck
gently
swung
and
then
remained
grounded
upon
a
shallow
in
the
stream
when
light
came
back
in
the
morning
burl
gazed
about
him
fearfully
he
was
some
twenty
yards
from
the
shore
and
thick
greenish
scum
surrounded
his
disintegrating
vessel
the
river
had
widened
greatly
until
the
opposite
bank
was
hidden
in
the
morning
mist
but
the
nearer
shore
seemed
firm
and
no
more
full
of
dangers
than
the
territory
inhabited
by
burl
tribe
he
tested
the
depth
of
the
water
with
his
spear
struck
by
the
multiple
usefulness
of
the
weapon
the
water
was
no
more
than
shivering
a
little
burl
stepped
down
into
the
green
scum
and
made
for
the
shore
at
top
speed
he
felt
something
soft
clinging
to
his
bare
foot
with
a
frantic
rush
he
ran
even
faster
and
stumbled
upon
the
shore
with
horror
not
at
his
heels
but
on
one
he
stared
down
at
his
foot
a
shapeless
pad
clung
to
the
skin
as
he
watched
it
swelled
visibly
the
pink
folds
becoming
a
deeper
shade
it
was
no
more
than
a
leech
the
size
of
his
palm
sharing
in
the
enlargement
nearly
all
the
insect
and
fungoid
world
had
undergone
but
burl
did
not
know
that
he
thrust
at
it
with
the
edge
of
his
spear
scraping
it
frantically
away
as
it
fell
off
burl
stared
in
horror
first
at
the
blotch
of
blood
on
his
foot
then
at
the
thing
writhing
and
pulsating
on
the
ground
he
fled
a
short
while
later
he
stumbled
into
one
of
the
familiar
toadstool
forests
and
paused
uncertainly
the
towering
toadstools
were
not
strange
to
burl
he
fell
to
eating
the
sight
of
food
always
produced
hunger
in
him
a
provision
of
nature
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
any
instinct
to
store
food
away
in
human
beings
the
storage
of
food
has
to
be
dictated
by
intellect
the
lower
orders
of
creatures
are
not
required
to
think
even
eating
though
burl
heart
was
small
within
him
he
was
far
from
his
tribe
and
saya
by
the
measurements
of
his
remotest
ancestors
no
more
than
forty
miles
separated
them
but
burl
did
not
think
in
such
terms
he
never
had
occasion
to
do
so
he
come
down
the
river
to
a
far
land
filled
with
unknown
dangers
and
he
was
alone
all
about
him
was
food
an
excellent
reason
for
gladness
but
being
solitary
was
reason
enough
for
distress
although
burl
was
a
creature
to
whom
reflection
was
normally
of
no
especial
value
and
therefore
not
practiced
in
thought
this
was
a
situation
providing
an
emotional
paradox
a
good
fourth
of
the
mushrooms
in
this
particular
forest
were
edible
burl
should
have
gloated
over
this
vast
stock
of
food
but
he
was
isolated
alone
in
particular
he
was
far
away
from
saya
therefore
he
should
have
wept
but
he
could
not
gloat
because
he
was
away
from
saya
and
he
could
not
mourn
because
he
was
surrounded
by
food
he
was
subject
to
a
stimulus
to
which
apparently
only
humankind
can
respond
an
emotional
dilemma
other
creatures
can
respond
to
objective
situations
where
there
is
the
need
to
choose
a
course
of
action
flight
or
fighting
hiding
or
pursuit
but
only
man
can
be
disturbed
by
not
knowing
which
of
two
emotions
to
feel
burl
had
reason
to
feel
two
entirely
different
emotional
states
at
the
same
time
he
had
to
resolve
the
paradox
the
problem
was
inside
him
not
out
so
he
thought
he
would
bring
saya
here
he
would
bring
her
and
the
tribe
to
this
place
where
there
was
food
in
vast
quantity
instantly
pictures
flooded
into
his
mind
he
could
actually
see
old
jon
his
bald
head
naked
as
a
mushroom
itself
stuffing
his
belly
with
the
food
which
was
so
plentiful
here
he
imagined
cori
feeding
her
children
tama
complaints
stilled
by
mouthfuls
of
food
tet
and
dik
stuffed
to
repletion
throwing
scraps
of
foodstuff
at
each
other
he
pictured
the
tribe
zestfully
and
saya
would
be
very
glad
it
was
remarkable
that
burl
was
able
to
think
of
his
feelings
instead
of
his
sensations
his
tribesmen
were
closer
to
it
than
equally
primitive
folk
had
been
back
on
earth
but
they
did
not
often
engage
in
thought
their
waking
lives
were
filled
with
physical
responses
to
physical
phenomena
they
were
hungry
and
they
saw
or
smelled
food
they
were
alive
and
they
perceived
the
presence
of
death
in
the
one
case
they
moved
toward
the
sensory
stimulus
of
food
in
the
other
they
fled
from
the
detected
stimulus
of
danger
they
responded
immediately
to
the
world
about
them
burl
for
the
first
significant
time
in
his
life
had
responded
to
inner
feelings
he
had
resolved
conflicting
emotions
by
devising
a
purpose
that
would
end
their
conflict
he
determined
to
do
something
because
he
wanted
to
and
not
because
he
had
to
it
was
the
most
important
event
upon
the
planet
in
generations
with
the
directness
of
a
child
or
a
savage
burl
moved
to
carry
out
his
purpose
the
fish
still
slung
about
his
neck
scraped
against
his
chest
fingering
it
tentatively
he
got
himself
thoroughly
greasy
in
the
process
but
could
not
eat
although
he
was
not
hungry
now
perhaps
saya
was
he
would
give
it
to
her
he
imagined
her
eager
delight
the
image
reinforcing
his
resolve
he
had
come
to
this
far
place
down
the
river
flowing
sluggishly
past
this
bank
to
return
to
the
tribe
he
would
go
back
up
that
bank
staying
close
to
the
stream
he
was
remarkably
exultant
as
he
forced
a
way
through
the
awkward
aisles
of
the
but
his
eyes
and
ears
were
still
open
for
any
possible
danger
several
times
he
heard
the
omnipresent
clicking
of
ants
scavenging
in
the
but
they
could
be
ignored
at
best
they
were
if
he
dropped
his
fish
they
would
become
absorbed
in
it
there
was
only
one
kind
of
ant
he
needed
to
fear
the
army
ant
which
sometimes
traveled
in
hordes
of
millions
eating
everything
in
their
path
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
here
the
mushroom
forest
came
to
an
end
a
cheerful
grasshopper
munched
delicately
at
some
dainty
it
had
found
the
young
shoot
of
a
its
hind
legs
were
bunched
beneath
it
in
perpetual
readiness
for
flight
a
monster
wasp
appeared
a
hundred
feet
overhead
checked
in
its
flight
and
plunged
upon
the
luckless
banqueter
there
was
a
struggle
but
it
was
brief
the
grasshopper
strained
terribly
in
the
grip
of
the
wasp
six
barbed
legs
the
wasp
flexible
abdomen
curved
delicately
its
sting
entered
the
jointed
armor
of
its
prey
just
beneath
the
head
with
all
the
deliberate
precision
of
a
surgeon
scalpel
a
ganglion
lay
there
the
entered
it
the
grasshopper
went
limp
it
was
not
dead
of
course
simply
paralyzed
permanently
paralyzed
the
wasp
preened
itself
then
grasped
its
victim
and
flew
away
the
grasshopper
would
be
incubator
and
for
an
egg
to
be
laid
presently
in
a
huge
mud
castle
a
small
white
worm
would
feed
upon
the
living
motionless
victim
of
its
mother
who
would
never
see
it
or
care
or
remember
burl
went
on
the
ground
grew
rougher
progress
became
painful
he
clambered
arduously
up
steep
slopes
all
of
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
and
made
his
way
cautiously
down
to
the
farther
sides
once
he
climbed
through
a
tangled
mass
of
mushrooms
so
closely
placed
and
so
small
that
he
had
to
break
them
apart
with
blows
of
his
spear
in
order
to
pass
as
they
crumbled
torrents
of
a
liquid
showered
down
upon
him
rolling
off
his
greasy
breast
and
sinking
into
the
ground
a
strange
now
took
possession
of
burl
he
walked
less
cautiously
and
more
boldly
he
had
thought
and
he
had
struck
something
feeling
the
vainglorious
of
a
child
he
pictured
himself
leading
his
tribe
to
this
place
of
very
much
food
he
had
no
real
idea
of
the
distance
and
he
strutted
all
alone
amid
the
of
the
planet
that
had
been
forgotten
presently
he
could
see
the
river
he
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
mound
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
high
one
side
was
crumbled
where
the
river
overflowed
at
some
past
the
water
had
lapped
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
along
which
burl
was
strutting
but
now
there
was
a
of
space
between
himself
and
the
water
and
there
was
something
else
in
the
cliffside
was
thickly
coated
with
fungi
in
a
riotous
confusion
of
white
and
yellow
and
orange
and
green
from
a
point
halfway
up
the
cliff
the
cable
of
a
stretched
down
to
anchorage
on
the
ground
below
there
were
other
cables
beyond
this
one
and
circling
about
their
radial
pattern
the
of
the
web
formed
a
perfect
logarithmic
spiral
somewhere
among
the
fungi
of
the
cliffside
the
huge
spider
who
had
built
this
web
awaited
the
entrapment
of
prey
when
some
unfortunate
creature
struggled
frenziedly
in
its
snare
it
would
emerge
until
then
it
waited
in
a
motionless
implacable
patience
utterly
certain
of
victims
utterly
merciless
to
them
burl
strutted
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
a
rather
foolish
creature
with
an
oily
fish
slung
about
his
neck
and
the
draggled
fragment
of
moth
wing
draping
his
middle
he
waved
the
long
shard
of
beetle
armor
exultantly
above
his
head
the
activity
was
not
very
sensible
it
served
no
purpose
but
if
burl
was
a
genius
among
his
fellows
then
he
still
had
a
great
deal
to
learn
before
his
genius
would
be
effective
now
he
looked
down
scornfully
upon
the
shining
white
trap
below
he
had
struck
a
fish
killing
it
when
he
hit
mushrooms
they
fell
into
pieces
before
him
nothing
could
frighten
him
he
would
go
to
saya
and
bring
her
to
this
land
where
food
grew
in
abundance
sixty
paces
away
from
burl
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
a
shaft
sank
vertically
into
the
soil
of
the
it
was
carefully
rounded
and
lined
with
silk
thirty
feet
down
it
enlarged
itself
into
a
chamber
where
the
engineer
and
proprietor
of
the
shaft
might
rest
the
top
of
the
hole
was
closed
by
a
stained
with
mud
and
earth
to
imitate
the
surrounding
soil
a
sharp
eye
would
have
been
needed
to
detect
the
opening
but
a
keener
eye
now
peered
out
from
the
crack
at
its
edge
that
eye
belonged
to
the
proprietor
eight
hairy
legs
surrounded
the
body
of
the
monster
hanging
motionless
at
the
top
of
the
shaft
its
belly
was
a
huge
misshapen
globe
colored
a
dirty
brown
two
pairs
of
mandibles
stretched
before
its
two
eyes
glittered
in
the
of
the
burrow
over
the
whole
body
spread
a
rough
and
mangy
fur
it
was
a
thing
of
implacable
malignance
of
incredible
ferocity
it
was
the
brown
hunting
spider
the
american
tarantula
enlarged
here
upon
the
forgotten
planet
so
that
its
body
was
two
feet
and
more
in
diameter
its
legs
outstretched
would
cover
a
circle
three
yards
across
the
glittering
eyes
followed
as
burl
strutted
forward
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
puffed
up
with
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
spread
out
below
the
white
snare
of
the
impressed
burl
as
amusing
he
knew
the
spider
would
leave
its
web
to
attack
him
reaching
down
he
broke
off
a
bit
of
fungus
growing
at
his
feet
where
he
broke
it
away
oozed
a
soupy
liquid
full
of
tiny
maggots
in
a
delirium
of
feasting
burl
flung
it
down
into
the
web
laughing
as
the
black
bulk
of
the
watchful
spider
swung
down
from
its
hiding
place
to
investigate
the
tarantula
peering
from
its
burrow
quivered
with
impatience
burl
drew
nearer
gleefully
using
his
spear
as
a
lever
to
pry
off
bits
of
trash
to
fall
down
the
cliffside
into
the
giant
web
the
spider
below
moved
leisurely
from
one
spot
to
another
investigating
each
new
missile
with
its
palpi
and
then
ignoring
it
as
lifeless
and
undesirable
prey
burl
leaped
and
laughed
aloud
as
a
particularly
large
lump
of
putrid
fungus
narrowly
missed
the
shape
below
then
the
fell
into
place
with
a
faint
sound
burl
whirled
about
his
laughter
transformed
instantly
into
a
scream
moving
toward
him
furiously
its
eight
legs
scrambling
was
the
monster
tarantula
its
mandibles
gaped
wide
the
poison
fangs
were
unsheathed
it
was
thirty
paces
away
twenty
paces
ten
eyes
glittering
it
leaped
all
eight
legs
extended
to
seize
the
prey
burl
screamed
again
and
thrust
out
his
arms
to
ward
off
the
creature
it
was
pure
blind
horror
there
was
no
genius
in
that
gesture
because
of
sheer
terror
his
grip
upon
the
spear
had
become
agonized
the
shot
out
and
the
tarantula
fell
upon
it
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
spear
entered
the
body
of
the
ferocious
thing
stuck
upon
the
spear
the
spider
writhed
horribly
still
striving
to
reach
the
paralytically
frozen
burl
the
great
mandibles
clashed
furious
bubbling
noises
came
from
it
the
hairy
legs
clutched
at
his
arm
he
cried
out
hoarsely
in
ultimate
fear
and
staggered
backward
and
the
edge
of
the
cliff
gave
way
beneath
him
he
hurtled
downward
still
clutching
the
spear
incapable
of
letting
go
even
while
falling
the
writhing
thing
still
struggled
maniacally
to
reach
him
down
through
emptiness
they
fell
together
burl
with
panic
then
there
was
a
strangely
elastic
crash
and
crackling
they
had
fallen
into
the
web
at
which
burl
had
been
laughing
so
scornfully
only
a
little
while
before
burl
could
think
he
only
struggled
insanely
in
the
gummy
coils
of
the
web
but
the
were
spiral
threads
enormously
elastic
exuding
impossibly
sticky
stuff
like
from
between
twisted
constituent
fibres
near
him
not
two
yards
away
the
creature
he
had
wounded
thrashed
and
fought
to
reach
him
even
while
shuddering
in
anguish
burl
had
reached
the
absolute
limit
of
panic
his
arms
and
breast
were
greasy
from
the
oily
fish
the
sticky
web
did
not
adhere
to
them
but
his
legs
and
body
were
inextricably
tangled
by
his
own
frantic
struggling
in
the
gummy
and
adhesive
elastic
threads
they
had
been
spread
for
prey
he
was
prey
he
paused
in
his
blind
struggle
gasping
from
pure
exhaustion
then
he
saw
not
five
yards
away
the
monster
he
had
mocked
so
recently
now
patiently
waiting
for
him
to
cease
his
struggles
the
tarantula
and
the
man
were
one
to
its
eyes
one
struggling
thing
that
had
fallen
opportunely
into
its
trap
they
were
moving
but
feebly
now
the
advanced
delicately
swinging
its
huge
bulk
nimbly
paying
out
a
silken
cable
behind
it
as
it
approached
burl
arms
were
free
he
waved
them
wildly
shrieking
at
the
monster
the
spider
paused
burl
moving
arms
suggested
mandibles
that
might
wound
spiders
take
few
chances
this
one
drew
near
cautiously
then
stopped
its
spinnerets
became
busy
and
with
one
of
its
eight
legs
used
like
an
arm
it
flung
a
sheet
of
gummy
silk
impartially
over
the
tarantula
and
the
man
burl
fought
against
the
descending
shroud
he
strove
to
thrust
it
away
futilely
within
minutes
he
was
completely
covered
in
a
coarse
silken
fabric
that
hid
even
the
light
from
his
eyes
he
and
his
enemy
the
monstrous
tarantula
were
beneath
the
same
covering
the
tarantula
moved
feebly
the
shower
ceased
the
had
decided
they
were
helpless
then
burl
felt
the
cables
of
the
web
give
slightly
as
the
spider
approached
to
sting
and
suck
the
juices
from
its
prey
the
web
yielded
gently
burl
froze
in
an
ecstasy
of
horror
but
the
tarantula
still
writhed
in
agony
upon
the
spear
piercing
it
it
clashed
its
jaws
shuddering
upon
the
horny
shaft
burl
waited
for
the
to
be
thrust
into
him
he
knew
the
process
he
had
seen
the
leisurely
fashion
in
which
the
delicately
stung
its
victim
then
withdrew
to
wait
with
horrible
patience
for
the
poison
to
take
effect
when
the
victim
no
longer
struggled
it
drew
near
again
to
suck
out
the
juices
first
from
one
joint
or
limb
and
then
from
another
leaving
a
creature
once
vibrant
with
life
a
shrunken
withered
husk
to
be
flung
from
the
web
at
nightfall
the
bloated
monstrosity
now
moved
meditatively
about
the
double
object
swathed
in
silk
only
the
tarantula
stirred
its
bulbous
abdomen
stirred
the
concealing
shroud
it
throbbed
faintly
as
it
still
struggled
with
the
spear
in
its
vitals
the
irregularly
rounded
projection
was
an
obvious
target
for
the
it
moved
quickly
forward
with
fine
merciless
precision
it
stung
the
tarantula
seemed
to
go
mad
with
pain
its
legs
struck
out
purposelessly
in
horrible
gestures
of
delirious
suffering
burl
screamed
as
a
leg
touched
him
he
struggled
no
less
wildly
his
arms
and
head
were
enclosed
by
the
folds
of
silk
but
not
glued
to
it
because
of
the
grease
clutching
at
the
cords
he
tried
desperately
to
draw
himself
away
from
his
deadly
neighbor
the
threads
would
break
but
they
did
separate
a
tiny
opening
appeared
one
of
the
tarantula
horribly
writhing
legs
touched
him
again
with
a
strength
born
of
utter
panic
he
hauled
himself
away
and
the
opening
enlarged
another
lunge
and
burl
head
emerged
into
the
open
air
he
was
suspended
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
which
was
almost
carpeted
with
the
chitinous
remains
of
past
victims
of
this
same
web
burl
head
and
breast
and
arms
were
free
the
fish
slung
over
his
shoulder
had
shed
its
oil
upon
him
impartially
but
the
lower
part
of
his
body
was
held
firm
by
the
viscous
gumminess
of
the
cord
it
was
vastly
more
adhesive
than
any
ever
made
by
men
he
hung
in
the
little
window
for
a
moment
despairing
then
he
saw
the
bulk
of
his
captor
a
little
distance
away
waiting
patiently
for
its
poison
to
work
and
its
prey
to
cease
struggling
the
tarantula
was
no
more
than
shuddering
now
soon
it
would
be
quite
still
and
the
creature
would
approach
for
its
meal
burl
withdrew
his
head
and
thrust
desperately
at
the
sticky
stuff
about
his
loins
and
legs
the
oil
upon
his
hands
kept
them
free
the
silk
shroud
gave
a
little
burl
grasped
at
the
thought
as
at
a
straw
he
grasped
the
fish
and
tore
it
pushing
frantically
at
his
own
body
with
the
scaly
odorous
mass
he
scraped
gum
from
his
legs
with
the
fish
smearing
the
rancid
oils
all
over
them
in
the
process
he
felt
the
web
tremble
again
to
the
spider
burl
movements
meant
that
its
poison
had
not
taken
full
effect
another
sting
seemed
to
be
necessary
this
time
it
would
not
insert
its
sting
into
the
quiescent
tarantula
but
where
there
was
still
life
it
would
send
its
venom
into
burl
he
gasped
and
drew
himself
toward
his
window
as
if
he
would
have
pulled
his
legs
from
his
body
his
head
emerged
his
shoulders
half
his
body
was
out
of
the
hole
the
great
spider
surveyed
him
and
made
ready
to
cast
more
of
its
silken
stuff
upon
him
the
spinnerets
became
active
a
leg
gathered
it
up
the
sticky
stuff
about
burl
feet
gave
way
he
shot
out
of
the
opening
and
fell
heavily
sprawling
upon
the
earth
below
and
crashing
into
the
shrunken
shell
of
a
flying
beetle
that
had
blundered
into
the
snare
and
not
escaped
as
he
had
done
burl
rolled
over
and
over
and
then
sat
up
an
angry
ant
stood
before
him
its
mandibles
extended
threateningly
while
a
shrill
stridulation
filled
the
air
in
ages
past
back
on
earth
where
most
ants
were
to
be
measured
in
fractions
of
an
inch
the
scientists
had
debated
gravely
whether
their
tribe
possessed
a
cry
they
believed
that
certain
grooves
upon
the
body
of
the
insect
like
those
upon
the
great
legs
of
the
cricket
might
be
the
means
of
making
a
sound
too
shrill
for
human
ears
to
catch
it
was
greatly
debated
but
evidence
was
hard
to
obtain
burl
did
not
need
evidence
he
knew
that
the
stridulation
was
caused
by
the
insect
before
him
though
he
had
never
wondered
how
it
was
produced
the
cry
was
emitted
to
summon
other
ants
from
its
city
to
help
it
in
difficulty
or
good
fortune
harsh
clickings
sounded
fifty
or
sixty
feet
away
comrades
were
coming
and
while
only
army
ants
were
normally
dangerous
any
tribe
of
ants
could
be
formidable
when
aroused
it
was
overwhelming
enough
to
pull
down
and
tear
a
man
to
shreds
as
a
pack
of
infuriated
might
do
on
earth
burl
fled
without
further
delay
nearly
colliding
with
one
of
the
then
he
heard
the
shrill
outcry
subside
the
ant
as
all
its
kind
no
longer
felt
threatened
it
went
peacefully
about
the
business
burl
had
interrupted
presently
it
found
some
edible
carrion
among
the
debris
from
the
and
started
triumphantly
back
to
its
city
burl
sped
on
for
a
few
hundred
yards
and
then
stopped
he
was
shaken
and
dazed
for
the
moment
he
was
as
timid
and
fearful
as
any
other
man
in
his
tribe
presently
he
would
realize
the
full
meaning
of
the
unparalleled
feat
he
had
performed
in
escaping
from
the
giant
spider
web
while
cloaked
with
folds
of
gummy
silk
it
was
not
only
it
was
unimaginable
but
burl
was
too
shaken
to
think
of
it
now
rather
quaintly
the
first
sensation
that
forced
itself
into
his
consciousness
was
that
his
feet
hurt
the
gluey
stuff
from
the
web
still
stuck
to
his
soles
picking
up
small
objects
as
he
went
along
old
fragments
of
insect
armor
pricked
him
so
persistently
even
through
his
toughened
that
he
paused
to
scrape
them
away
staring
fearfully
about
all
the
while
after
a
dozen
steps
more
he
was
forced
to
stop
again
it
was
this
nagging
discomfort
rather
than
vanity
or
an
emergency
which
caused
burl
to
discover
imagine
blunder
into
a
new
activity
as
as
anything
else
he
had
done
his
brain
had
been
uncommonly
stimulated
in
the
past
hours
it
had
plunged
him
into
at
least
one
predicament
because
of
his
conceiving
the
idea
of
stabbing
something
but
it
had
also
allowed
him
escape
from
another
even
more
terrifying
one
just
now
in
between
it
had
led
to
the
devising
of
a
purpose
the
bringing
of
saya
here
though
that
decision
was
not
so
firmly
fixed
as
it
had
been
before
the
encounter
with
the
still
it
had
surely
been
reasoning
of
a
sort
that
told
him
to
grease
his
body
with
the
fish
otherwise
he
would
now
be
following
the
tarantula
as
a
second
course
for
the
occupant
of
the
web
burl
looked
cautiously
all
about
him
it
seemed
to
be
quite
safe
then
quite
deliberately
he
sat
down
to
think
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
ever
deliberately
contemplated
a
problem
with
the
idea
of
finding
an
answer
to
it
and
the
notion
of
doing
such
a
thing
was
on
this
planet
he
examined
his
foot
the
sharp
edges
of
pebbles
and
the
remnants
of
hurt
his
feet
when
he
walked
they
had
done
so
ever
since
he
had
been
born
but
never
before
had
his
feet
been
sticky
so
that
the
irritation
from
one
object
persisted
for
more
than
a
step
he
carefully
picked
away
each
fragment
one
by
one
partly
coated
with
the
gum
they
even
tended
to
cling
to
his
fingers
except
where
the
oil
was
thick
burl
reasoning
had
been
of
the
simplest
sort
he
had
contemplated
a
situation
not
deliberately
but
because
he
had
to
and
presently
his
mind
showed
him
a
way
out
of
it
it
was
a
way
specifically
suited
to
the
situation
here
he
faced
something
different
presently
he
applied
the
answer
of
one
problem
to
a
second
problem
oil
on
his
body
had
let
him
go
free
of
things
that
would
stick
to
him
here
things
stuck
to
his
feet
so
he
oiled
them
and
it
worked
burl
strode
away
almost
but
not
completely
untroubled
by
the
bothersome
pebbles
and
bits
of
discarded
armor
then
he
halted
to
regard
himself
with
astonished
appreciation
he
was
still
miles
from
his
tribe
he
was
naked
and
unarmed
utterly
ignorant
of
wood
and
fire
and
weapons
other
than
the
one
he
had
lost
but
he
paused
to
observe
with
some
awe
that
he
was
very
wonderful
indeed
he
wanted
to
display
himself
but
his
spear
was
gone
so
burl
found
it
necessary
to
think
again
and
the
remarkable
thing
about
it
was
that
he
succeeded
in
a
surprisingly
brief
time
he
had
come
up
with
a
list
of
answers
he
was
naked
so
he
would
find
garments
for
himself
he
was
weaponless
he
would
find
himself
a
spear
he
was
hungry
and
he
would
seek
food
since
he
was
far
from
his
tribe
he
would
go
to
them
and
this
was
in
a
fashion
quite
obviously
thought
but
it
was
not
oblivious
on
the
forgotten
planet
because
it
had
been
futile
up
to
now
the
importance
of
such
thought
in
the
scheme
of
things
was
that
men
had
not
been
thinking
even
so
simply
as
this
living
only
from
minute
to
minute
burl
was
fumbling
his
way
into
a
habit
of
thinking
from
problem
to
problem
and
that
was
very
important
indeed
even
in
the
advanced
civilization
of
other
planets
few
men
really
used
their
minds
the
great
majority
of
people
depended
on
machines
not
only
for
computations
but
decisions
as
well
any
decisions
not
made
by
machines
most
men
left
to
their
leaders
burl
tribesfolk
thought
principally
with
their
stomachs
making
few
if
any
decisions
on
any
other
basis
though
they
did
act
very
often
under
the
spur
of
fear
actions
however
were
not
thought
out
burl
was
thinking
out
his
actions
there
would
be
consequences
he
faced
upstream
and
began
to
move
again
slowly
and
warily
his
eyes
keenly
searching
out
the
way
ahead
ears
alert
for
the
slightest
sound
of
danger
gigantic
butterflies
riotous
in
coloring
fluttered
overhead
through
the
hazy
air
sometimes
a
grasshopper
hurtled
from
one
place
to
another
like
a
projectile
its
transparent
wings
beating
frantically
now
and
then
a
wasp
sped
by
intent
upon
its
hunting
or
a
bee
droned
heavily
alone
anxious
and
worried
striving
to
gather
pollen
in
a
nearly
flowerless
world
burl
marched
on
from
somewhere
far
behind
him
came
a
very
faint
sound
it
was
a
shrill
noise
but
very
distant
indeed
absorbed
in
immediate
and
nearby
matters
burl
took
no
heed
he
had
the
limited
local
viewpoint
of
a
child
what
was
near
was
important
and
what
was
distant
could
be
ignored
anything
not
imminent
still
seemed
to
him
insignificant
and
he
was
preoccupied
the
source
of
this
sound
was
important
however
its
origin
was
a
myriad
of
clickings
compounded
into
a
single
noise
it
was
in
fact
the
but
yet
perceptible
sound
of
army
ants
on
the
march
the
locusts
of
earth
were
very
trivial
nuisances
compared
to
the
army
ants
of
this
planet
locusts
in
past
ages
on
earth
had
eaten
all
green
things
here
in
the
lowlands
were
only
giant
cabbages
and
a
few
rank
tenacious
growths
grasshoppers
were
numerous
here
but
could
never
be
thought
of
as
a
plague
they
were
incapable
of
multiplying
to
the
size
of
locust
hordes
army
ants
however
but
burl
did
not
notice
the
sound
he
moved
forward
briskly
though
cautiously
searching
the
for
any
sign
of
garments
food
and
weapons
he
confidently
expected
to
find
all
of
them
within
a
short
distance
indeed
he
did
find
food
very
soon
no
more
than
a
half
mile
ahead
he
found
a
small
cluster
of
edible
fungi
with
no
special
elation
burl
broke
off
a
food
supply
from
the
largest
of
them
naturally
he
took
more
than
he
could
possibly
eat
at
one
time
he
went
on
nibbling
at
a
big
piece
of
mushroom
abstractedly
past
a
broad
plain
more
than
a
mile
across
and
broken
into
odd
little
hillocks
by
gradually
ripening
mushrooms
which
were
unfamiliar
to
him
in
several
places
the
ground
had
been
pushed
aside
by
rounded
objects
only
the
tips
showing
hemispheres
seemed
to
be
forcing
themselves
through
the
soil
so
they
might
reach
the
outer
air
careful
not
to
touch
any
of
them
burl
examined
the
hillocks
curiously
as
he
entered
the
plain
they
were
strange
and
to
burl
most
strange
things
meant
danger
in
any
event
he
had
two
conscious
purposes
now
he
wanted
garments
and
weapons
above
the
plain
a
wasp
hovered
dangling
a
heavy
object
beneath
its
black
belly
across
which
ran
a
single
red
band
it
was
the
gigantic
descendant
of
the
hairy
differing
only
in
size
from
its
remote
ancestors
on
earth
it
was
taking
a
paralyzed
gray
caterpillar
to
its
burrow
burl
watched
it
drop
down
with
the
speed
and
sureness
of
an
arrow
pull
aside
a
heavy
flat
stone
and
descend
into
the
burrow
with
its
momentarily
laid
aside
it
vanished
underground
into
a
vertical
shaft
dug
down
forty
feet
or
more
it
evidently
inspected
the
refuge
reappearing
it
vanished
into
the
hole
again
dragging
the
gray
worm
after
it
burl
marching
on
over
the
broad
plain
spotted
with
some
eruptive
disease
did
not
know
what
passed
below
but
he
did
observe
the
wasp
emerge
again
to
scratch
dirt
and
stones
previously
excavated
laboriously
back
into
the
shaft
until
it
was
full
the
wasp
had
paralyzed
a
caterpillar
taken
it
into
the
burrow
laid
an
egg
upon
it
and
sealed
up
the
entrance
in
time
the
egg
would
hatch
into
a
grub
barely
the
size
of
burl
forefinger
and
the
grub
deep
underground
would
feed
upon
the
living
but
helpless
caterpillar
until
it
waxed
large
and
fat
then
it
would
weave
itself
a
cocoon
and
sleep
a
long
sleep
only
to
wake
as
a
wasp
and
dig
its
way
out
to
the
open
air
reaching
the
farther
side
of
the
plain
burl
found
himself
threading
the
aisles
of
a
fungus
forest
in
which
the
growths
were
misshapen
travesties
of
the
trees
which
could
not
live
here
bloated
yellow
limbs
branched
off
from
rounded
swollen
trunks
here
and
there
a
puffball
burl
height
and
half
his
height
again
waited
until
a
chance
touch
should
cause
it
to
shoot
upward
a
curling
puff
of
infinitely
fine
dust
he
continued
to
move
with
caution
there
were
dangers
here
but
he
went
forward
steadily
he
still
held
a
great
mass
of
edible
mushroom
under
one
arm
and
from
time
to
time
broke
off
a
fragment
chewing
it
meditatively
but
always
his
eyes
searched
here
and
there
for
threats
of
harm
behind
him
the
faint
shrill
outcry
had
risen
only
slightly
in
volume
it
was
still
too
far
away
to
attract
his
notice
army
ants
however
were
working
havoc
in
the
distance
by
thousands
and
millions
myriads
of
them
advanced
across
the
fungoid
soil
they
clambered
over
every
eminence
they
descended
into
every
depression
their
antennae
waved
restlessly
their
mandibles
were
extended
threateningly
the
ground
was
black
with
them
each
one
more
than
ten
inches
long
a
single
such
creature
armored
and
fearless
as
it
was
could
be
formidable
enough
to
an
unarmed
and
naked
man
like
burl
the
better
part
of
discretion
would
be
avoidance
but
numbering
in
the
thousands
and
millions
they
were
something
which
could
not
be
avoided
they
advanced
steadily
and
rapidly
the
chorus
of
shrill
stridulations
and
clickings
marking
their
progress
great
inoffensive
caterpillars
crawling
over
the
huge
cabbages
heard
the
sound
of
their
coming
but
were
too
stupid
to
flee
the
black
multitudes
blanketed
the
rank
vegetables
tiny
voracious
jaws
tore
at
the
flaccid
masses
of
greasy
flesh
the
caterpillars
strove
to
throw
off
their
assailants
by
writhings
and
contortions
uselessly
the
bees
fought
their
entrance
into
the
monster
hives
with
stings
and
moths
took
to
the
air
in
daylight
with
dazzled
blinded
eyes
but
nothing
could
withstand
the
relentless
hordes
of
small
black
things
that
reeked
of
formic
acid
and
left
the
ground
behind
them
empty
of
life
before
the
horde
was
a
world
of
teeming
life
where
mushrooms
and
other
fungi
fought
with
thinning
numbers
of
cabbages
and
mutant
for
a
foothold
behind
the
black
multitude
was
nothing
mushrooms
cabbages
bees
wasps
crickets
grubs
every
living
thing
that
could
not
flee
before
the
creeping
black
tide
reached
it
was
lost
torn
to
bits
by
tiny
mandibles
even
the
hunting
spiders
and
tarantulas
fell
before
the
black
host
they
killed
many
in
their
desperate
but
the
army
ants
could
overwhelm
anything
anything
at
all
by
sheer
numbers
and
ferocity
killed
or
wounded
ants
served
as
food
for
their
sound
comrades
only
the
web
spiders
sat
unmoved
and
immovable
in
their
collossal
snares
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
their
gummy
webs
could
not
be
invaded
along
the
slender
supporting
cables
the
purple
the
army
ants
flowed
over
the
ground
like
a
surging
monstrous
inky
tide
their
vanguard
reached
the
river
and
recoiled
burl
was
perhaps
five
miles
away
when
they
changed
their
course
the
change
was
made
without
confusion
the
leaders
somehow
communicating
the
altered
line
of
march
to
those
behind
them
back
on
earth
scientists
had
gravely
debated
the
question
of
how
ants
conveyed
ideas
to
each
other
honeybees
it
was
said
performed
elaborate
ritual
dances
to
exchange
information
ants
it
had
been
observed
had
something
less
eccentric
a
single
ant
finding
a
bit
of
booty
too
big
for
it
to
manage
alone
would
return
to
its
city
to
secure
the
help
of
others
from
that
fact
men
had
deduced
that
a
language
of
gestures
made
with
crossed
antennae
must
exist
burl
had
no
theories
he
merely
knew
facts
but
he
did
know
that
ants
could
and
did
pass
information
to
one
another
now
however
he
moved
cautiously
along
toward
the
of
his
tribe
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
black
blanket
of
living
creatures
spreading
over
the
ground
behind
him
a
million
tragedies
marked
the
progress
of
the
insect
army
there
was
a
tiny
colony
of
mining
bees
their
habits
unchanged
despite
their
greater
size
here
on
the
forgotten
planet
a
single
mother
four
feet
long
had
dug
a
huge
gallery
with
some
ten
offshooting
cells
in
which
she
had
laid
her
eggs
and
fed
her
grubs
with
pollen
the
grubs
had
waxed
fat
and
large
become
bees
and
laid
eggs
in
their
turn
within
the
same
gallery
their
mother
had
dug
out
for
them
ten
bulky
insects
now
foraged
busily
to
feed
their
grubs
within
the
ancestral
home
while
the
founder
of
the
colony
had
grown
draggled
and
wingless
with
the
passing
of
time
unable
to
bring
in
food
herself
the
old
bee
became
the
guardian
of
the
hive
she
closed
the
opening
with
her
head
making
a
living
barrier
within
the
entrance
she
withdrew
only
to
grant
admission
or
exit
to
the
duly
authorized
members
her
daughters
the
ancient
concierge
of
the
underground
dwelling
was
at
her
post
when
the
wave
of
army
ants
swept
over
tiny
feet
trampled
upon
her
and
she
emerged
to
fight
with
mandible
and
sting
for
the
sanctity
of
her
brood
within
moments
she
was
a
shaggy
mass
of
biting
ants
they
rent
and
tore
at
her
chitinous
armor
but
she
fought
on
madly
sounding
a
buzzing
alarm
to
the
colonists
yet
within
they
came
out
fighting
as
they
came
ten
huge
bees
each
four
to
five
feet
long
and
fighting
with
legs
and
jaws
with
wing
and
mandible
and
with
all
the
ferocity
of
so
many
tigers
but
the
small
ants
covered
them
snapping
at
their
multiple
eyes
biting
at
the
tender
joints
in
their
armour
and
sometimes
releasing
the
larger
prey
to
leap
upon
an
injured
comrade
wounded
by
the
monster
they
battled
together
such
a
fight
however
could
have
but
one
end
struggle
as
the
bees
might
they
were
powerless
against
their
assailants
they
were
being
devoured
even
as
they
fought
and
before
the
last
of
the
ten
was
down
the
underground
gallery
had
been
gutted
both
of
the
stored
food
brought
by
the
adult
defenders
and
the
last
morsels
of
what
had
been
young
grubs
too
unformed
to
do
more
than
twitch
helplessly
inoffensively
as
they
were
torn
to
shreds
when
the
army
ants
went
on
there
were
merely
an
empty
tunnel
and
a
few
fragments
of
tough
armor
unappetizing
even
to
the
ants
burl
heard
them
as
he
meditatively
inspected
the
scene
of
a
tragedy
of
not
long
before
the
rent
and
scraped
fragments
of
a
great
shiny
casing
lay
upon
the
ground
a
greater
beetle
had
come
upon
the
first
and
slain
him
burl
regarded
the
remains
of
the
meal
three
or
four
minims
little
ants
barely
six
inches
long
foraged
industriously
among
the
bits
a
new
was
to
be
formed
and
the
queen
lay
hidden
half
a
mile
away
these
were
the
first
hatchlings
they
would
feed
their
younger
kindred
until
they
grew
large
enough
to
take
over
the
great
work
of
the
burl
ignored
the
minims
he
searched
for
a
weapon
of
some
sort
behind
him
the
clicking
roar
of
the
horde
of
army
ants
increased
in
volume
he
turned
away
disgustedly
the
best
thing
he
could
find
in
the
way
of
a
weapon
was
a
when
he
picked
it
up
an
angry
whine
rose
from
the
ground
one
of
the
minims
had
been
struggling
to
detach
a
morsel
of
flesh
from
the
burl
had
snatched
the
tidbit
from
him
the
little
creature
was
surely
no
more
than
half
a
foot
long
but
it
advanced
angrily
upon
burl
shrilling
a
challenge
he
struck
with
the
beetle
leg
and
crushed
the
ant
two
of
the
other
minims
appeared
attracted
by
the
noise
the
first
had
made
they
discovered
the
crushed
body
of
their
fellow
unceremoniously
dismembered
it
and
bore
it
away
in
triumph
burl
went
on
swinging
the
toothed
limb
in
his
hand
the
sound
behind
him
became
a
distant
whispering
and
growing
steadily
nearer
the
army
ants
swept
into
a
mushroom
forest
and
the
yellow
growths
soon
swarmed
with
the
black
creatures
a
great
bluebottle
fly
shining
with
a
metallic
lustre
stood
beneath
a
mushroom
on
the
ground
the
mushroom
was
infected
with
maggots
which
exuded
a
solvent
pepsin
that
liquefied
the
firm
white
meat
they
swam
ecstatically
in
the
liquid
gruel
some
of
which
dripped
and
dripped
to
the
ground
the
bluebottle
was
sipping
the
liquid
through
its
long
proboscis
quivering
with
delight
as
it
fed
on
the
noisomeness
burl
drew
near
and
struck
the
fly
collapsed
in
a
quivering
heap
burl
stood
over
it
for
an
instant
and
pondered
the
army
ants
were
nearer
now
they
swarmed
down
into
a
tiny
valley
rushing
into
and
through
a
little
brook
over
which
burl
had
leaped
since
ants
can
remain
underwater
for
a
long
time
without
drowning
the
small
stream
was
not
even
dangerous
its
current
did
sweep
some
of
them
away
a
great
many
of
them
however
clung
together
until
they
chocked
its
flow
by
the
mass
of
their
bodies
the
main
force
marching
across
the
bridge
they
constituted
the
ants
reached
a
place
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
left
of
line
of
march
perhaps
a
mile
from
the
spot
where
he
stood
over
the
dead
bluebottle
there
was
an
expanse
of
some
acres
in
which
the
giant
rank
cabbages
had
so
far
succeeded
in
their
competition
with
the
world
of
fungi
the
pale
flowers
of
the
cabbages
formed
food
for
many
bees
the
leaves
fed
numberless
grubs
and
worms
under
the
dead
foliage
single
leaves
were
twenty
feet
across
at
their
largest
crickets
hid
and
fed
the
flowed
into
this
space
devouring
every
living
thing
it
encountered
a
terrible
din
arose
the
crickets
hurtled
away
in
erratic
leapings
they
shot
aimlessly
in
any
direction
more
than
half
of
them
landed
blindly
in
the
carpeting
of
clicking
black
bodies
which
were
the
ants
from
whose
vanguard
they
had
fled
their
blind
flight
had
no
effect
save
to
give
different
individuals
the
opportunity
to
seize
them
as
they
fell
and
instantly
begin
to
devour
them
as
they
were
torn
to
fragments
horrible
screamings
reached
burl
ears
a
single
such
cry
of
agony
would
not
have
attracted
burl
attention
he
lived
in
a
world
of
nightmare
horror
but
a
chorus
of
creatures
in
torment
made
him
look
up
this
was
no
minor
horror
something
wholesale
was
in
progress
he
jerked
his
head
about
to
see
what
it
was
a
wild
stretch
of
sickly
yellow
fungus
was
interspersed
here
and
there
with
a
squat
toadstool
or
a
splash
of
vivid
color
where
one
of
the
many
rusts
had
found
a
foothold
to
the
left
a
group
of
branched
fungoids
clustered
in
silent
mockery
of
a
true
forest
burl
saw
the
faded
green
of
the
cabbages
with
the
sun
never
shining
on
the
huge
leaves
save
through
the
overhead
the
cabbages
were
not
vivid
there
were
even
some
mouldy
yeasts
of
a
brighter
green
and
slime
much
more
luridly
tinted
even
so
the
cabbages
were
the
largest
form
of
true
vegetation
burl
had
ever
seen
the
nodding
white
cruciform
flowers
stood
out
plainly
against
the
yellowish
pallid
green
of
the
leaves
but
as
burl
gazed
at
them
the
green
slowly
became
black
three
great
grubs
in
lazy
contentment
were
eating
ceaselessly
of
the
cabbages
on
which
they
rested
suddenly
first
one
and
then
another
began
to
jerk
spasmodically
burl
saw
that
around
each
of
them
a
rim
of
black
had
formed
then
black
motes
milled
all
over
them
the
grubs
became
black
covered
with
biting
devouring
ants
the
cabbages
became
black
the
frenzied
contortions
of
the
grubs
told
of
the
agonies
they
underwent
as
they
were
literally
devoured
alive
and
then
burl
saw
a
black
wave
appear
at
the
nearer
edge
of
the
stretch
of
yellow
fungus
a
glistening
living
flood
flowed
forward
over
the
ground
with
a
roar
of
clickings
and
a
persistent
overtone
of
shrill
stridulations
burl
scalp
crawled
he
knew
what
this
meant
and
he
did
not
pause
to
think
with
a
gasp
of
pure
panic
he
turned
and
fled
all
intellectual
preoccupations
forgotten
the
black
tide
came
on
after
him
he
flung
away
the
edible
mushroom
he
had
carried
under
his
arm
somehow
though
he
clung
to
the
club
as
he
darted
between
tangled
masses
of
fungus
ignoring
now
the
dangers
that
ordinarily
called
for
vast
caution
huge
flies
appeared
they
buzzed
about
him
loudly
once
he
was
struck
on
the
shoulder
by
one
of
them
at
least
as
large
as
his
hand
and
his
skin
torn
by
its
swiftly
vibrating
wings
he
brushed
it
away
and
sped
on
but
the
oil
with
which
he
was
partly
covered
had
turned
rancid
now
and
the
fetid
odor
attracted
them
there
were
half
a
dozen
then
a
dozen
creatures
the
size
of
pheasants
droning
and
booming
as
they
kept
pace
with
his
wild
flight
a
weight
pressed
onto
his
head
it
doubled
two
of
the
disgusting
creatures
had
settled
upon
his
oily
hair
to
sip
the
stuff
through
their
hairy
burl
shook
them
off
with
his
hand
and
raced
madly
on
his
ears
attuned
to
the
sounds
of
the
ants
behind
him
that
clicking
roar
continued
but
in
burl
ears
it
was
almost
drowned
out
by
the
noise
made
by
the
halo
of
flies
accompanying
him
their
buzzing
had
deepened
in
pitch
with
the
increase
in
size
of
all
their
race
it
was
now
the
note
close
to
the
deepest
bass
tone
of
an
organ
yet
flies
though
greatly
enlarged
on
the
forgotten
planet
had
not
become
magnified
as
much
as
some
of
the
other
creatures
there
were
no
great
heaps
of
putrid
matter
for
them
to
lay
their
eggs
in
the
ants
were
busy
scavengers
carting
away
the
debris
of
tragedies
in
the
insect
world
long
before
it
could
acquire
the
gamey
flavor
beloved
of
only
in
isolated
spots
were
the
flies
really
numerous
in
such
places
they
clustered
in
clouds
such
a
cloud
began
to
form
about
burl
as
he
fled
it
seemed
as
though
a
miniature
whirlwind
kept
pace
with
him
a
whirlwind
composed
of
furry
revolting
bodies
and
eyes
fleeing
burl
had
to
swing
his
club
before
him
to
clear
the
way
almost
every
stroke
was
interrupted
by
an
impact
against
some
body
which
collapsed
with
the
spurting
of
reddish
liquid
then
an
anguish
as
of
iron
struck
upon
burl
back
one
of
the
stinging
flies
had
thrust
its
proboscis
into
his
flesh
to
suck
the
blood
burl
uttered
a
cry
and
ran
into
the
stalk
of
a
blackened
draggled
toadstool
there
was
a
curious
crackling
as
of
wet
punk
the
toadstool
collapsed
upon
itself
with
a
strange
splashing
sound
a
great
many
creatures
had
laid
their
eggs
in
it
until
now
it
was
a
seething
mass
of
corruption
and
liquid
when
the
toadstool
crashed
to
the
ground
it
crumbled
into
a
dozen
pieces
spattering
the
earth
for
yards
all
about
with
stinking
stuff
in
which
tiny
headless
maggots
writhed
convulsively
the
buzzing
of
the
flies
took
on
a
note
of
solemn
satisfaction
they
settled
down
upon
this
feast
burl
staggered
to
his
feet
and
darted
off
again
now
he
was
nothing
but
a
minor
attraction
to
the
flies
only
three
or
four
bothering
to
come
after
him
the
others
settled
by
the
edges
of
the
splashing
fluid
quickly
absorbed
in
an
ecstasy
of
feasting
the
few
still
hovering
about
his
head
burl
killed
but
he
did
not
have
to
smash
them
all
the
remaining
few
descended
to
feast
on
their
fallen
comrades
twitching
feebly
at
his
feet
he
ran
on
and
passed
beneath
the
leaves
of
an
isolated
giant
cabbage
a
great
grasshopper
crouched
on
the
ground
its
tremendous
jaws
crunching
the
rank
vegetation
half
a
dozen
great
worms
ate
steadily
of
the
leaves
that
supported
them
one
had
swung
itself
beneath
an
overhanging
leaf
which
would
have
thatched
houses
for
men
and
was
placidly
anchoring
itself
for
the
spinning
of
a
cocoon
in
which
to
sleep
the
sleep
of
metamorphosis
a
mile
away
the
great
black
tide
of
army
ants
advanced
relentlessly
the
great
cabbage
the
huge
grasshopper
and
all
the
stupid
caterpillars
on
the
leaves
would
presently
be
covered
with
small
black
demons
the
cocoon
would
never
be
spun
the
caterpillars
would
be
torn
into
thousands
of
furry
fragments
and
devoured
the
grasshopper
would
strike
out
with
his
terrific
unguided
strength
crushing
its
assailants
with
blows
of
its
great
and
powerful
jaws
but
it
would
die
making
terrible
sounds
of
torments
as
the
ants
consumed
it
piecemeal
the
sound
of
the
ants
advance
overwhelmed
all
other
noises
now
burl
ran
madly
his
breath
coming
in
great
gasps
his
eyes
wide
with
panic
alone
of
the
world
about
him
he
knew
the
danger
that
followed
him
the
insects
he
passed
went
about
their
business
with
that
terrifying
abstracted
efficiency
found
only
in
the
insect
world
burl
heart
pounded
madly
from
his
running
the
breath
whistled
in
his
nostrils
and
behind
him
the
flood
of
army
ants
kept
pace
they
came
upon
the
feasting
flies
some
took
to
the
air
and
escaped
others
were
too
absorbed
in
their
delicious
meal
the
twitching
maggots
stranded
by
the
scattering
of
their
soupy
broth
were
torn
to
shreds
and
eaten
the
flies
who
were
seized
vanished
into
tiny
maws
and
the
serried
ranks
of
ants
moved
on
burl
could
hear
nothing
else
now
but
the
clickings
of
their
limbs
and
the
stridulating
challenges
and
they
uttered
now
and
then
another
sound
pierced
the
noises
made
by
the
ants
themselves
a
cricket
perhaps
seized
and
dying
uttering
cries
of
agony
before
the
horde
there
was
a
busy
world
which
teemed
with
life
butterflies
floated
overhead
on
lazy
wings
grubs
waxed
fat
and
huge
crickets
feasted
great
spiders
sat
quietly
in
their
lairs
waiting
with
implacable
patience
for
prey
to
fall
into
the
and
snares
great
beetles
lumbered
through
the
mushroom
forests
seeking
food
and
making
love
in
monstrous
tragic
fashion
behind
the
wide
front
of
the
army
ants
was
chaos
emptiness
desolation
all
life
save
that
of
the
army
ants
was
exterminated
though
some
bewildered
flying
creatures
still
fluttered
helplessly
over
the
silent
landscape
yet
even
behind
the
army
ants
little
bands
of
stragglers
from
the
horde
marched
busily
here
and
there
seeking
some
trace
of
life
that
had
been
overlooked
by
the
main
body
burl
put
forth
his
last
ounce
of
strength
his
limbs
trembled
his
breathing
was
agony
sweat
stood
out
upon
his
forehead
he
ran
for
his
life
with
the
desperation
of
one
who
knows
that
death
is
at
his
heels
he
ran
as
if
his
continued
existence
among
the
million
tragedies
of
the
single
day
were
the
purpose
for
which
the
universe
had
been
created
there
was
redness
in
the
west
and
in
the
overhead
to
the
east
gray
sky
became
a
deeper
gray
much
deeper
it
was
not
yet
time
for
the
creatures
of
the
day
to
seek
their
nor
for
the
to
come
forth
but
in
many
secret
spots
there
were
vague
and
sleepy
stirrings
heedless
of
the
approaching
darkness
burl
sped
over
an
open
space
a
hundred
yards
across
a
thicket
of
beautifully
golden
mushrooms
barred
his
way
danger
lay
there
he
dogged
aside
and
saw
in
the
gray
dusk
a
glistening
sheet
of
white
barely
a
yard
above
the
ground
it
was
the
web
of
the
which
on
earth
was
noted
only
in
hedges
and
such
places
when
the
dew
of
earliest
dawn
exposed
it
as
a
patternless
plate
of
there
were
of
course
but
no
geometry
tidy
housewives
also
on
earth
used
to
mop
it
out
of
corners
as
a
filmy
fabric
of
irritating
gossamer
on
the
forgotten
planet
it
was
a
net
with
strength
and
qualities
that
increased
day
by
day
as
its
spinner
moved
restlessly
over
the
surface
always
trailing
sticky
cord
behind
itself
burl
had
no
choice
but
to
avoid
it
even
though
he
lost
ground
to
the
roaring
behind
him
and
night
was
definitely
on
the
way
it
was
inconceivable
that
a
human
should
travel
in
the
lowlands
after
dark
it
literally
could
not
be
done
over
the
normal
nightmare
terrain
burl
had
not
only
to
escape
the
army
ants
but
find
a
quickly
if
he
was
to
see
tomorrow
light
but
he
could
not
think
so
far
ahead
just
now
he
blundered
through
a
screen
of
puffballs
that
shot
dusty
powder
toward
the
sky
ahead
a
range
of
strangely
colored
hills
came
into
view
purple
green
black
and
gold
melting
into
each
other
and
branching
off
inextricably
mingled
they
rose
to
a
height
of
perhaps
sixty
or
seventy
feet
a
curious
grayish
haze
had
gathered
above
them
it
seemed
to
be
a
layer
of
thin
vapor
not
like
mist
or
fog
clinging
to
certain
parts
of
the
hills
rising
slowly
to
coil
and
gather
into
an
indefinitely
thicker
mass
above
the
ridges
the
hills
themselves
were
not
geological
features
but
masses
of
fungus
that
had
grown
and
cannibalized
piling
up
upon
themselves
to
the
thickness
of
carboniferous
vegetation
over
the
face
of
the
hills
grew
every
imaginable
variety
of
yeast
and
mould
and
rust
they
grew
within
and
upon
themselves
forming
freakish
conglomerations
that
piled
up
into
a
range
of
hills
stretching
across
the
lunatic
landscape
for
miles
burl
blundered
up
the
nearest
slope
sometimes
the
surface
was
a
hard
rind
that
held
him
up
sometimes
his
feet
sank
perhaps
inches
perhaps
to
he
scrambled
frantically
panting
gasping
staggering
from
the
exhaustion
of
moving
across
the
fungus
quicksand
he
made
his
way
to
the
top
of
the
first
hill
plunged
down
into
a
little
valley
on
the
farther
side
and
up
another
slope
he
left
a
clear
trail
behind
him
of
disturbed
and
scurrying
creatures
that
had
inevitably
found
a
home
in
the
mass
of
living
stuff
small
sinuous
centipedes
scuttled
here
and
there
roused
by
his
passage
at
the
bottom
of
his
footprints
writhed
fat
white
worms
beetles
popped
into
view
and
vanished
again
a
half
mile
across
the
range
and
burl
could
go
no
farther
he
stumbled
and
fell
and
lay
there
gasping
hoarsely
overhead
the
gray
sky
had
become
a
which
was
rapidly
melting
into
that
redness
too
deep
to
be
seen
except
as
black
but
there
was
still
some
light
from
the
west
burl
sobbed
for
breath
in
a
little
hollow
his
club
still
clasped
in
his
hands
something
huge
with
wings
like
sails
soared
in
silhouette
against
the
sunset
burl
lay
motionless
breathing
in
great
gasps
his
limbs
refusing
to
lift
him
the
sound
of
the
army
ants
continued
at
last
above
the
crest
of
the
last
hillock
he
had
surmounted
two
tiny
glistening
antennae
appeared
then
the
small
deadly
shape
of
an
army
ant
the
forerunner
of
its
horde
it
moved
deliberately
forward
waving
its
antennae
ceaselessly
it
made
its
way
toward
burl
tiny
clickings
coming
from
its
limbs
a
little
wisp
of
vapor
swirled
toward
the
ant
it
was
the
vapor
that
had
gathered
over
the
whole
range
of
hills
as
a
thin
low
cloud
it
enveloped
the
ant
which
seemed
to
be
thrown
into
a
strange
convulsion
throwing
itself
about
legs
moving
aimlessly
if
it
had
been
an
animal
instead
of
an
insect
it
would
have
choked
and
gasped
but
ants
breathe
through
in
their
abdomens
it
writhed
helplessly
on
the
spongy
stuff
across
which
it
had
been
moving
burl
was
conscious
of
a
strange
sensation
his
body
felt
remarkably
warm
it
felt
hot
it
was
an
unparalleled
sensation
because
burl
had
no
experience
of
fire
or
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
only
warmth
he
had
ever
known
was
when
huddling
together
with
his
tribesmen
in
some
to
avoid
the
damp
chill
of
the
night
then
the
heat
of
their
breath
and
flesh
helped
to
combat
discomfort
but
this
was
a
fiercer
heat
it
was
intolerable
burl
moved
his
body
with
a
tremendous
effort
and
for
a
moment
the
fungus
soil
was
cool
beneath
him
then
the
sensation
of
hotness
began
again
and
increased
until
burl
skin
was
reddened
and
inflamed
the
tenuous
vapor
too
seemed
to
swirl
his
way
it
made
his
lungs
smart
and
his
eyes
water
he
still
breathed
in
painful
gasps
but
even
that
short
period
of
rest
had
done
him
some
good
but
it
was
the
heat
that
drove
him
to
his
feet
again
he
crawled
painfully
to
the
crest
of
the
next
hill
he
looked
back
this
was
the
highest
hill
he
had
come
upon
and
he
could
see
most
of
the
purple
range
in
the
deep
deep
dusk
now
he
was
more
than
halfway
through
the
hills
he
had
barely
a
to
go
northward
but
east
and
west
the
range
of
purple
hills
was
a
ceaseless
undulating
mass
of
lifts
and
hollows
of
ridges
and
spurs
of
all
imaginable
colorings
and
at
the
tips
of
most
of
them
were
wisps
of
curling
gray
from
his
position
he
could
see
a
long
stretch
of
the
hills
not
hidden
by
the
surrounding
darkness
back
along
the
way
he
had
come
the
army
ants
now
swept
up
into
the
range
of
hills
scouts
and
parties
scurried
here
and
there
they
stopped
to
devour
the
creatures
inhabiting
the
surface
layers
but
the
main
body
moved
on
inexorably
the
hills
though
were
alive
not
upheavals
of
the
ground
but
festering
heaps
of
insanely
growing
fungus
hollowed
out
in
many
places
by
tunnels
and
these
the
ants
invaded
they
swept
on
devouring
everything
burl
leaned
heavily
upon
his
club
and
watched
dully
he
could
run
no
more
the
army
ants
were
spreading
everywhere
they
would
reach
him
soon
far
to
the
right
the
vapor
thickened
a
thin
column
of
smoke
arose
in
the
dim
burl
did
not
know
smoke
of
course
he
could
not
conceivably
guess
that
deep
down
in
the
interior
of
the
insanely
growing
hills
pressure
had
killed
and
oxidation
had
carbonized
the
material
by
oxidation
the
temperature
down
below
had
been
raised
in
the
damp
darkness
of
the
bowels
of
the
hills
spontaneous
combustion
had
begun
the
great
mounds
of
tinderlike
mushroom
had
begun
to
burn
very
slowly
quite
unseen
there
had
been
no
flames
because
the
hills
surface
remained
intact
and
there
was
no
air
to
feed
the
burning
but
when
the
army
ants
dug
ferociously
for
fugitive
small
things
air
was
admitted
to
tunnels
abandoned
because
of
heat
then
slow
combustion
speeded
up
smoulderings
became
flames
sparks
became
coals
a
dozen
columns
of
smoke
rose
into
the
heavens
and
gathered
into
a
dense
pall
above
the
range
of
purple
hills
and
burl
apathetically
watched
the
serried
ranks
of
army
ants
march
on
toward
the
widening
furnaces
that
awaited
them
they
had
recoiled
from
the
river
instinctively
but
their
ancestors
had
never
known
fire
in
the
amazon
basin
on
earth
there
had
never
been
forest
fires
on
the
forgotten
planet
there
had
never
been
fires
at
all
unless
the
first
forgotten
colonists
tried
to
make
them
in
any
case
the
army
ants
had
no
instinctive
terror
of
flame
they
marched
into
the
blazing
openings
that
appeared
in
the
hills
they
snapped
with
their
mandibles
at
the
leaping
flames
and
sprang
to
grapple
with
the
burning
coals
the
blazing
areas
widened
as
the
purple
surface
was
consumed
burl
watched
without
comprehension
even
without
thankfulness
he
stood
breathing
more
and
more
easily
until
the
glow
from
approaching
flames
reddened
his
skin
and
the
acrid
smoke
made
tears
flow
from
his
eyes
then
he
retreated
slowly
leaning
on
his
club
and
often
looking
back
night
had
fallen
but
yet
it
was
light
to
the
army
ants
they
marched
on
shrilling
their
defiance
they
poured
devotedly
and
ferociously
into
the
inferno
of
flame
at
last
there
were
only
small
groups
of
stragglers
from
the
great
scurrying
here
and
there
over
the
ground
their
comrades
had
stripped
of
all
life
the
bodies
of
the
main
army
made
a
vast
malodor
burning
in
the
furnace
of
the
hills
there
had
been
pain
in
that
burning
agony
such
as
no
one
would
willing
dwell
upon
but
it
came
of
the
insane
courage
of
the
ants
attacking
the
burning
stuff
with
their
horny
jaws
rolling
over
and
over
with
flaming
lumps
of
charcoal
clutched
in
their
mandibles
burl
heard
them
shrilling
their
even
as
they
died
blinded
antennae
singed
off
legs
shriveling
they
yet
went
forward
to
attack
their
impossible
enemy
burl
made
his
way
slowly
over
the
hills
twice
he
saw
small
bodies
of
the
vanished
army
they
had
passed
between
the
widening
furnaces
and
furiously
devoured
all
that
moved
as
they
forged
ahead
once
burl
was
spied
and
a
shrill
cry
sounded
but
he
moved
on
and
only
a
single
ant
rushed
after
him
burl
brought
down
his
club
and
a
writhing
body
remained
to
be
eaten
by
its
comrades
when
they
came
upon
it
and
now
the
last
faint
traces
of
light
had
vanished
in
the
west
there
was
no
real
brightness
anywhere
except
the
flames
of
the
burning
hills
the
slow
slow
nightly
rain
that
dripped
down
all
through
the
dark
hours
began
it
made
a
pattering
noise
upon
the
unburnt
part
of
the
hills
burl
found
firm
ground
beneath
his
feet
he
listened
keenly
for
sounds
of
danger
something
rustled
heavily
in
a
thicket
of
toadstools
a
hundred
feet
away
there
were
sounds
of
preening
and
of
feet
delicately
placed
here
and
there
upon
the
ground
then
a
great
body
took
to
the
air
with
the
throbbing
beat
of
mighty
wings
a
fierce
of
air
smote
burl
and
he
looked
upward
in
time
to
glimpse
the
outline
of
a
huge
moth
passing
overhead
he
turned
to
watch
the
line
of
its
flight
and
saw
the
fierce
glow
filling
all
the
horizon
the
hills
burned
brighter
as
the
flames
widened
he
crouched
beneath
a
squat
toadstool
and
waited
for
the
dawn
the
rain
kept
on
falling
with
irregular
beats
upon
the
tough
top
of
the
toadstool
he
did
not
sleep
he
was
not
properly
hidden
and
there
was
always
danger
in
the
dark
but
this
was
not
the
darkness
burl
was
used
to
the
great
fires
grew
and
spread
in
the
masses
of
mushroom
the
glare
on
the
horizon
grew
brighter
through
the
hours
it
also
came
nearer
burl
shivered
a
little
as
he
watched
he
had
never
even
dreamed
of
fire
before
and
even
the
overhanging
clouds
were
lighted
by
these
flames
over
a
stretch
at
least
a
dozen
miles
in
length
and
from
half
a
mile
to
three
miles
across
the
seething
furnaces
and
columns
of
smoke
sent
illumination
over
the
world
it
was
like
the
glow
the
lights
of
a
city
can
throw
upon
the
sky
and
like
the
flitting
of
aircraft
above
a
city
was
the
assembly
of
fascinated
creatures
of
the
night
great
moths
and
flying
beetles
gigantic
gnats
and
midges
grown
huge
upon
this
planet
fluttered
and
danced
above
the
flames
as
the
fire
came
nearer
burl
could
see
them
colossal
creatures
sweeping
above
the
expanse
there
were
moths
with
wings
of
spread
beating
the
air
with
mighty
strokes
their
huge
eyes
glowing
like
garnets
as
they
stared
intoxicatedly
at
the
incandescence
below
them
burl
saw
a
great
soaring
above
the
hills
with
wings
all
of
forty
feet
across
they
fluttered
like
sails
of
unbelievable
magnificence
and
this
was
when
all
the
separate
flames
had
united
to
form
a
single
sheet
of
burning
stuff
spread
across
the
land
for
miles
feathery
antennae
of
the
finest
lace
spread
out
before
the
head
of
the
its
body
was
of
softest
velvet
a
ring
of
fur
marked
where
its
head
began
the
glare
from
below
smote
the
maroon
of
its
body
with
a
strange
effect
for
one
instant
it
was
outlined
clearly
its
eyes
shone
more
redly
than
any
ruby
fire
the
great
delicate
wings
were
poised
in
flight
burl
caught
the
flash
of
flame
upon
the
two
great
irridescent
spots
on
the
wings
shining
purple
and
bright
red
all
the
glory
of
chalcedony
and
of
chrysoprase
was
reflected
in
the
glare
of
burning
fungi
and
then
burl
saw
it
plunge
downward
straight
into
the
thickest
and
fiercest
of
the
leaping
flames
it
flung
itself
into
the
furnace
as
a
willing
drunken
victim
of
their
beauty
flying
beetles
flew
clumsily
above
the
pyre
also
their
horny
stiffly
outstretched
in
the
light
from
below
they
shone
like
burnished
metal
their
clumsy
bodies
with
spurred
and
limbs
darted
through
the
smoke
like
so
many
grotesque
meteors
burl
saw
strange
collisions
and
still
stranger
meetings
male
and
female
flying
creatures
circled
and
spun
in
the
glare
dancing
their
dance
of
love
and
death
they
mounted
higher
than
burl
could
see
drunk
with
the
ecstasy
of
living
and
then
descended
to
plunge
headlong
in
the
roaring
flames
below
from
every
side
the
creatures
came
moths
of
brightest
yellow
with
furry
bodies
palpitant
with
life
flew
madly
to
destruction
other
moths
of
a
deepest
black
with
gruesome
symbols
on
their
wings
swiftly
came
to
dance
above
the
glow
like
motes
in
sunlight
and
burl
crouched
beneath
a
toadstool
watching
while
the
perpetual
slow
raindrops
fell
and
fell
and
a
continuous
hissing
noise
came
from
where
the
rain
splashed
amid
the
flames
a
killer
of
the
night
wore
on
while
the
creatures
above
the
firelight
danced
and
died
their
numbers
ever
reinforced
by
fresh
arrivals
burl
sat
tensely
still
his
eyes
watching
everything
while
his
mind
groped
for
an
explanation
of
what
he
saw
at
last
the
sky
grew
dimly
gray
then
brighter
and
after
a
long
time
it
was
day
the
flames
of
the
burning
hills
seemed
to
dim
and
die
as
all
the
world
became
bright
after
a
long
while
burl
crawled
from
his
and
stood
erect
no
more
than
two
hundred
paces
from
where
he
stood
a
straight
wall
of
smoke
rose
from
the
burl
could
see
the
smoke
rising
for
miles
on
either
hand
he
turned
to
continue
on
his
way
and
saw
the
remains
of
one
of
the
tragedies
of
the
night
a
great
moth
had
flown
into
the
flames
been
horribly
scorched
and
floundered
out
again
had
it
been
able
to
fly
it
would
have
returned
to
its
devouring
deity
but
now
it
lay
upon
the
ground
its
antennae
hopelessly
seared
one
beautiful
wing
was
nothing
but
gaping
holes
the
eyes
had
been
dimmed
by
flame
the
exquisitely
tapering
limbs
lay
broken
and
crushed
by
the
violence
of
landing
the
creature
was
helpless
on
the
ground
only
the
stumps
of
its
antennae
moving
restlessly
and
the
abdomen
pulsating
slowly
as
it
drew
breaths
burl
drew
near
he
raised
his
club
when
he
moved
on
there
was
a
velvet
cloak
cast
over
his
shoulders
gleaming
with
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbows
a
gorgeous
mass
of
soft
blue
was
about
his
middle
and
he
had
bound
upon
his
forehead
two
fragments
of
the
moth
magnificent
antennae
he
strode
on
slowly
clad
as
no
man
had
been
clad
in
all
the
ages
before
him
after
a
while
another
victim
of
the
holocaust
similarly
blundered
out
to
die
yielded
him
a
spear
that
was
longer
and
sharper
and
much
more
deadly
than
his
first
so
he
took
up
his
journey
to
saya
looking
like
a
prince
of
ind
upon
a
bridal
journey
though
surely
no
mere
prince
ever
wore
such
raiment
for
many
miles
burl
threaded
his
way
through
an
extensive
forest
of
toadstools
they
towered
high
over
his
head
colorful
parasitic
moulds
and
rusts
all
about
their
bases
twice
he
came
upon
open
glades
where
bubbling
pools
of
green
slime
festered
in
corruption
once
he
hid
himself
as
a
monster
scarabeus
beetle
lumbered
by
three
yards
away
clanking
like
some
mighty
machine
burl
saw
the
heavy
armor
and
jaws
of
the
monster
he
almost
envied
him
his
weapons
the
time
was
not
yet
come
though
when
burl
and
his
kind
would
hunt
such
giants
for
the
juicy
flesh
within
its
armored
limbs
burl
was
still
a
savage
still
ignorant
still
essentially
timid
his
only
significant
advance
had
been
that
where
at
first
he
had
fled
without
reasoning
now
he
paused
to
see
if
he
need
flee
he
was
a
strange
sight
moving
through
the
shadowed
lanes
of
the
forest
in
his
cloak
of
velvet
the
leg
of
a
fighting
beetle
rested
in
a
strip
of
sinew
about
his
waist
ready
for
use
his
new
spear
was
taller
than
himself
he
looked
like
a
conqueror
but
he
was
still
a
fearful
and
feeble
creature
no
match
for
the
monstrous
creatures
about
him
he
was
weak
and
in
that
lay
his
greatest
hope
because
if
he
were
strong
he
would
not
need
to
think
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
before
his
ancestors
had
been
forced
to
develop
brains
as
penalty
for
the
lack
of
claws
or
fangs
burl
was
sunk
as
low
as
any
of
them
but
he
had
to
combat
more
horrifying
enemies
more
inexorable
dangers
and
many
times
more
crafty
antagonists
his
ancestors
had
invented
knives
and
spears
and
flying
missiles
but
the
creatures
about
burl
had
weapons
a
thousand
times
more
deadly
than
the
ones
that
had
defended
the
first
humans
the
fact
however
simply
put
a
premium
on
the
one
faculty
burl
had
which
the
insect
world
has
not
in
he
heard
a
discordant
bellow
coming
from
a
spot
not
twenty
yards
from
where
he
moved
he
hid
in
panic
waiting
for
an
instant
listening
the
bellow
came
again
but
this
time
with
a
querulous
note
burl
heard
a
crashing
and
plunging
as
of
some
creature
caught
in
a
snare
a
mushroom
tumbled
with
a
spongelike
sound
and
the
thud
was
followed
by
a
tremendous
commotion
something
was
fighting
desperately
against
something
else
but
burl
did
not
know
what
creatures
were
in
combat
he
waited
and
the
noise
died
gradually
away
presently
his
breath
came
more
slowly
and
his
courage
returned
he
stole
from
his
and
would
have
made
away
but
new
curiosity
held
him
back
instead
of
creeping
from
the
scene
he
moved
cautiously
toward
the
source
of
the
noise
peering
between
two
stalks
he
saw
a
wide
snare
of
silk
spread
out
before
him
some
twenty
yards
across
and
as
many
deep
the
individual
threads
could
be
plainly
seen
but
in
the
mass
it
seemed
a
fabric
of
sheerest
finest
texture
held
up
by
tall
mushrooms
it
was
anchored
to
the
ground
below
and
drew
away
to
a
small
point
through
which
a
hole
led
to
some
as
yet
unseen
recess
all
the
space
of
the
wide
snare
was
hung
with
threads
fine
twisted
threads
no
more
than
half
the
thickness
of
burl
finger
this
was
the
trap
of
a
labyrinth
spider
not
one
of
the
interlacing
strands
was
strong
enough
to
hold
any
but
the
feeblest
prey
but
the
threads
were
there
by
thousands
a
cricket
had
become
entangled
in
the
sticky
maze
its
limbs
thrashed
out
and
broke
threads
with
every
stroke
but
each
time
became
entangled
in
a
dozen
more
it
struggled
mightily
emitting
at
intervals
again
its
horrible
bass
roar
burl
breathed
more
easily
he
watched
with
fascinated
eyes
mere
death
among
insects
even
tragic
death
held
no
great
interest
for
him
it
was
too
common
an
occurrence
and
there
were
few
insects
which
deliberately
sought
man
most
insects
have
their
allotted
prey
and
will
seek
no
others
but
this
involved
a
spider
and
spiders
have
a
terrifying
impartiality
a
spider
devouring
some
luckless
insect
was
but
an
example
of
what
might
happen
to
burl
so
he
watched
alertly
his
eyes
traveling
from
the
enmeshed
cricket
to
the
strange
opening
at
the
back
of
the
labyrinth
that
opening
darkened
two
shining
glistening
eyes
had
been
watching
from
the
tunnel
in
which
the
spider
had
been
waiting
now
it
swung
out
lightly
revealing
itself
as
a
gray
spider
with
twin
black
ribbons
upon
its
thorax
and
two
stripes
of
curiously
speckled
brown
and
white
upon
its
abdomen
burl
saw
also
two
curious
appendages
like
a
tail
as
it
came
nimbly
out
of
its
and
approached
the
trapped
creature
the
cricket
was
struggling
weakly
now
and
the
cries
it
uttered
were
but
feeble
because
of
the
cords
that
fettered
its
limbs
burl
saw
the
spider
throw
itself
upon
the
cricket
which
gave
one
final
convulsive
shudder
as
fangs
pierced
its
armor
shortly
after
the
spider
fed
with
bestial
enjoyment
it
sucked
all
the
succulence
all
the
fluid
from
its
victim
carcass
then
the
breath
left
burl
in
a
peculiar
frightened
gasp
it
was
not
from
anything
he
saw
or
heard
it
was
something
that
he
thought
for
a
second
his
knees
knocked
together
in
panic
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
burl
had
killed
a
hunting
spider
a
tarantula
upon
the
cliff
true
the
killing
had
been
an
accident
and
had
nearly
cost
him
his
own
life
in
the
snare
but
he
had
killed
a
spider
and
of
the
most
deadly
kind
now
it
occurred
to
burl
that
he
could
kill
another
spiders
were
the
ogres
of
the
human
tribes
on
the
forgotten
planet
knowledge
of
them
was
hard
to
come
by
because
to
study
them
was
death
but
all
men
knew
that
never
left
their
traps
never
and
burl
had
imagined
himself
making
an
impossibly
splendid
incredibly
daring
use
of
that
fact
denying
to
himself
that
he
intended
any
action
so
suicidal
he
nevertheless
drew
back
from
the
front
of
the
snare
and
made
his
way
to
the
back
where
the
spider
tunnel
was
no
more
than
ten
feet
away
then
he
found
himself
waiting
presently
through
the
interstices
of
the
silk
he
saw
the
gray
bulk
of
the
spider
it
had
left
the
drained
and
shrunken
carcass
of
the
cricket
to
return
to
its
settling
itself
carefully
upon
the
soft
walls
of
the
fabric
tunnel
from
the
yielding
globular
nest
at
the
tunnel
end
it
fixed
maniacal
eyes
once
more
upon
the
threads
of
its
snare
seen
down
the
length
of
the
burl
hair
stood
on
end
from
sheer
fright
but
he
was
the
slave
of
an
idea
the
tunnel
and
the
nest
at
its
end
did
not
rest
on
the
ground
but
were
suspended
in
air
by
cables
like
those
that
spread
the
gin
itself
the
gray
bulged
the
fabric
it
lay
in
luxurious
comfort
waiting
for
victims
to
approach
there
was
sweat
on
burl
face
as
he
raised
his
spear
the
bare
idea
of
attacking
a
spider
was
horrifying
but
actually
he
was
in
no
danger
whatever
before
the
instant
of
the
because
never
never
leave
their
webs
to
hunt
so
burl
sweated
and
grasped
his
spear
with
agonized
firmness
and
thrust
it
into
the
bulge
that
was
the
spider
body
in
its
nest
he
thrust
with
hysterical
fury
and
then
he
ran
as
if
the
devil
were
after
him
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
dared
come
back
his
heart
in
his
throat
all
was
still
he
had
missed
the
horrid
convulsions
of
the
wounded
spider
he
had
not
heard
the
frightful
gnashings
of
its
fangs
at
the
piercing
weapon
nor
seen
the
silken
threads
of
the
tunnel
ripped
and
torn
in
the
spider
burl
came
back
to
quietness
there
was
a
great
rent
in
the
silken
tunnel
and
a
puddle
of
stuff
lay
upon
the
ground
from
time
to
time
another
droplet
fell
from
the
spear
to
join
it
and
the
great
spider
had
fallen
half
through
its
own
enlargement
of
the
rent
made
by
the
spear
in
the
wall
of
the
nest
burl
stared
even
when
he
saw
it
the
thing
was
not
easy
to
believe
the
dead
eyes
of
the
spider
looked
at
him
with
mad
frozen
malignity
the
fangs
were
still
raised
to
kill
the
hairy
legs
were
still
braced
as
if
to
enlarge
further
the
gaping
hole
through
which
it
had
partly
fallen
then
burl
felt
exultation
his
tribe
had
been
furtive
vermin
for
almost
forty
generations
fleeing
from
the
mighty
insects
hiding
from
them
and
when
caught
waiting
helplessly
for
death
screaming
shrilly
in
horror
but
he
burl
had
turned
the
tables
he
a
man
had
killed
a
spider
his
breast
expanded
always
his
tribesmen
went
quietly
and
fearfully
making
no
sound
but
a
sudden
surprising
triumphant
yell
burst
from
burl
lips
the
first
of
man
upon
the
forgotten
planet
in
two
thousand
years
next
second
of
course
his
pulse
almost
stopped
in
sheer
terror
because
he
had
made
such
a
noise
he
listened
fearfully
the
insect
world
was
oblivious
to
him
presently
shuddering
but
infinitely
proud
he
drew
near
his
prey
he
carefully
withdrew
his
spear
poised
to
flee
if
the
spider
stirred
it
did
not
it
was
dead
the
blood
upon
the
spear
was
revolting
burl
wiped
it
off
on
a
leathery
toadstool
then
he
thought
of
saya
and
his
tribesmen
trembling
even
as
he
gloated
over
his
own
remarkable
self
he
shifted
the
spider
and
worked
it
out
of
the
nest
presently
he
moved
off
with
the
belly
of
the
spider
upon
his
back
and
two
of
its
hairy
legs
over
his
shoulders
the
other
limbs
of
the
monster
hung
limp
trailing
on
the
ground
behind
him
marching
then
he
was
the
first
such
spectacle
in
history
his
velvet
cloak
shining
with
its
irridescent
spots
the
scraps
of
golden
antennae
bound
to
his
forehead
a
spear
in
his
hand
and
the
hideous
bulk
of
a
gray
spider
for
burden
burl
was
a
very
strange
sight
indeed
he
believed
that
other
creatures
fled
before
him
because
of
the
thing
he
carried
he
tended
to
grow
haughty
but
actually
of
course
insects
do
not
know
fear
they
recognize
their
own
specific
enemies
that
is
necessary
but
the
his
of
the
lowlands
on
the
forgotten
planet
went
on
abstractedly
despite
the
splendid
feat
of
one
man
burl
marched
he
came
upon
a
valley
full
of
torn
and
tattered
mushrooms
there
was
not
a
single
yellow
top
among
them
every
one
had
been
infested
with
maggots
that
had
liquefied
the
tough
meat
of
the
causing
it
to
drip
to
the
ground
below
the
liquid
was
gathered
in
a
golden
pool
in
the
center
of
the
small
depression
burl
heard
a
loud
and
humming
before
he
saw
the
valley
then
he
stopped
and
looked
down
he
saw
the
golden
pond
its
surface
reflecting
the
gray
sky
and
the
darkened
stumps
of
mushrooms
on
the
hillside
which
looked
as
if
they
had
been
blackened
by
a
running
flame
a
small
brooklet
of
golden
liquid
trickled
over
a
rocky
ledge
and
all
round
the
edges
of
the
pond
and
brook
in
ranks
and
rows
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
and
it
seemed
by
millions
were
the
bodies
of
great
flies
they
were
small
compared
to
other
insects
the
laid
their
eggs
by
the
hundreds
in
decaying
carcasses
the
others
chose
mushrooms
to
lay
their
eggs
in
to
feed
the
maggots
that
would
hatch
a
relatively
great
quantity
of
food
was
needed
therefore
the
flies
must
remain
comparatively
small
or
the
body
of
a
single
grasshopper
would
furnish
food
for
only
a
few
maggots
instead
of
the
hundreds
it
must
support
there
must
also
be
a
limit
to
the
size
of
worms
if
hundreds
were
to
feast
upon
a
single
fungus
but
there
was
no
limitation
to
the
greediness
of
the
adult
creatures
there
were
bluebottles
and
and
all
the
flies
of
metallic
lustre
gathered
at
a
lucullan
feast
of
corruption
the
buzzing
of
those
swarming
above
the
golden
pool
was
a
tremendous
sound
the
flying
bodies
flashed
and
glittered
as
they
flew
back
and
forth
seeking
a
place
to
alight
and
join
in
the
orgy
the
glittering
bodies
clustered
in
places
were
motionless
as
if
carved
from
metal
burl
watched
them
and
then
he
saw
motion
overhead
a
slender
brilliant
shape
appeared
darting
swiftly
through
the
air
enlarging
into
a
body
with
transparent
shining
wings
and
two
huge
eyes
it
circled
and
enlarged
again
becoming
a
shimmering
dragonfly
twenty
feet
and
more
in
length
it
poised
itself
abruptly
above
the
pool
and
then
darted
down
its
jaws
snapping
viciously
they
snapped
again
and
again
burl
could
not
follow
their
slashings
and
with
each
snap
the
glittering
body
of
a
fly
vanished
a
second
dragonfly
appeared
and
a
third
they
swooped
above
the
golden
pool
snapping
in
making
their
abrupt
and
angular
turns
creatures
of
incredible
ferocity
and
beauty
in
that
mass
of
buzzing
creatures
even
the
most
voracious
appetite
must
soon
have
been
sated
but
the
slender
creatures
still
darted
about
in
frenzied
destruction
and
all
this
while
the
loud
contented
humming
went
on
as
before
their
comrades
were
slaughtered
by
the
hundreds
not
forty
feet
above
their
heads
but
still
the
glittering
rows
of
flies
gorged
themselves
upon
the
fluid
of
the
pond
the
dragonflies
feasted
until
they
were
unable
to
devour
even
a
single
one
more
of
their
chosen
prey
but
even
then
they
continued
to
sweep
madly
above
the
pool
striking
down
the
buzzing
flies
though
their
bodies
must
perforce
remain
uneaten
some
of
the
dead
flies
crushed
to
pulp
by
the
angry
dragonflies
dropped
among
their
feasting
brothers
presently
one
of
them
placed
its
disgusting
proboscis
upon
the
mangled
creature
it
sipped
daintily
from
the
contents
of
the
broken
armor
another
joined
it
and
another
in
a
little
while
a
cluster
of
them
pushed
against
each
other
for
a
chance
to
join
them
in
a
cannibalistic
feast
burl
turned
aside
and
went
on
leaving
the
dragonflies
still
at
their
massacre
and
the
flies
absorbed
and
ecstatic
at
their
feast
the
feast
indeed
was
improved
by
the
rain
of
murdered
brethren
from
overhead
only
a
few
miles
farther
on
burl
came
upon
a
familiar
landmark
he
knew
it
well
but
had
always
kept
at
a
safe
distance
from
it
a
mass
of
rock
had
heaved
itself
up
from
the
almost
level
plain
over
which
he
traveled
to
form
an
cliff
at
one
point
the
rock
overhung
forming
an
inverted
ledge
a
roof
over
nothingness
which
had
been
preempted
by
a
hairy
monster
and
made
into
a
dwelling
a
white
hemisphere
clung
to
the
rock
firmly
anchored
by
long
cables
burl
knew
the
place
as
one
to
be
feared
a
clotho
spider
had
built
itself
a
nest
there
from
which
it
emerged
to
hunt
the
unwary
within
the
silken
globe
was
a
monstrosity
resting
upon
cushions
of
softest
silk
the
exterior
had
been
beautiful
once
but
if
one
went
too
near
one
of
the
little
inverted
arches
seemingly
closed
by
panels
of
silk
it
would
open
and
out
would
rush
a
creature
from
a
dream
of
hell
surely
burl
knew
this
place
hung
upon
the
walls
of
the
fairy
palace
were
trophies
they
had
a
purpose
of
course
stones
and
boulders
hung
there
too
to
hold
the
structure
firm
against
the
that
rarely
blew
but
amid
the
stones
and
fragments
of
there
was
a
very
special
decoration
the
shrunken
dessicated
skeleton
of
a
man
the
death
of
that
man
had
saved
burl
life
two
years
before
they
had
been
together
seeking
a
new
source
of
edible
mushroom
the
clotho
spider
was
a
hunter
not
a
spinner
of
webs
it
had
sprung
suddenly
from
behind
a
great
puffball
as
the
two
men
froze
in
horror
then
it
had
come
forward
and
deliberately
chosen
its
victim
it
did
not
choose
burl
now
he
looked
with
speculation
at
the
lair
of
his
ancient
enemy
some
day
perhaps
but
now
he
passed
on
he
went
past
the
thicket
in
which
the
great
moths
hid
by
day
past
the
slimy
pool
in
which
something
unknown
but
terrible
lurked
he
penetrated
the
little
forest
of
mushrooms
that
glowed
at
night
and
the
place
where
the
beetles
chirped
thunderously
during
the
dark
hours
and
then
he
saw
saya
he
caught
a
flash
of
pink
skin
vanishing
behind
a
squat
toadstool
and
he
ran
forward
calling
her
name
she
emerged
and
saw
the
figure
with
the
horrible
bulk
of
the
spider
on
its
back
she
cried
out
in
horror
and
burl
understood
he
let
his
burden
fall
running
swiftly
to
her
they
met
saya
waited
timidly
until
she
saw
who
this
man
was
and
then
she
was
astounded
indeed
with
golden
plumes
rising
from
his
head
a
velvet
cloak
about
his
shoulders
blue
about
his
middle
and
a
spear
in
his
hand
and
a
dead
spider
behind
him
this
was
not
the
burl
she
had
known
he
took
her
hands
babbling
proudly
she
stared
at
him
and
at
his
victim
but
the
language
of
men
had
diminished
sadly
struggling
to
comprehend
presently
her
eyes
glowed
she
pulled
at
his
wrists
when
they
found
the
other
tribesmen
they
were
carrying
the
dead
spider
between
them
saya
looking
more
proud
than
burl
meat
of
man
killing
in
their
climb
up
from
savagery
the
principal
handicap
from
which
men
have
always
suffered
is
the
fact
that
they
are
human
or
it
can
be
said
that
human
beings
always
have
to
struggle
against
the
obstacle
which
is
simply
that
they
are
men
to
burl
his
splendid
return
to
the
tribe
called
for
a
suitable
reaction
he
expected
them
to
take
note
that
he
was
remarkable
unparalleled
and
in
all
ways
admirable
he
expected
them
to
look
at
him
with
awe
he
rather
hoped
that
the
sight
of
him
would
involve
something
like
ecstasy
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
did
for
fully
an
hour
they
gathered
around
him
while
he
used
his
and
their
scanty
vocabulary
to
tell
them
of
his
unique
achievements
and
adventures
during
the
past
two
days
and
nights
they
listened
attentively
and
with
appropriate
admiration
and
vicarious
pride
this
in
itself
was
a
step
upward
mostly
their
talk
was
of
where
food
might
be
found
and
where
danger
lurked
strictly
practical
data
connected
with
the
pressing
business
of
getting
enough
to
eat
and
staying
alive
the
sheer
pressure
of
existence
was
so
great
that
the
humans
burl
knew
had
altogether
abandoned
such
luxuries
as
boastful
narrative
they
had
given
up
tradition
they
did
not
think
of
art
in
even
its
most
primitive
forms
and
the
only
craft
they
knew
was
the
craftiness
which
promoted
simple
survival
so
for
them
to
listen
to
a
narrative
which
did
not
mean
either
food
or
even
a
lessening
of
danger
to
themselves
was
a
step
upward
on
the
cultural
scale
but
they
were
savages
they
inspected
the
dead
spider
shuddering
it
was
pure
horror
they
did
not
touch
it
the
adults
not
at
all
and
even
dik
and
tet
not
for
a
very
long
time
nobody
thought
of
spiders
as
food
too
many
of
them
had
been
spiders
food
but
presently
even
the
horror
aroused
by
the
spider
palled
the
younger
children
quailed
at
sight
of
it
of
course
but
the
adults
came
to
ignore
it
only
the
two
gangling
boys
tried
to
break
off
a
furry
leg
with
which
to
charge
and
terrify
the
younger
ones
still
further
they
failed
to
get
it
loose
because
they
did
not
think
of
cutting
it
but
they
had
nothing
to
cut
it
with
anyhow
old
jon
went
wheezing
off
foraging
he
waved
a
hand
to
burl
as
he
went
burl
was
indignant
but
it
was
true
that
he
had
brought
back
no
food
and
people
must
eat
tama
went
off
her
tongue
clacking
with
lona
the
girl
to
help
her
find
and
bring
back
something
edible
dor
the
strongest
man
in
the
tribe
went
away
to
look
where
he
thought
there
might
be
edible
mushrooms
again
cori
left
with
her
children
very
carefully
on
watch
for
danger
to
them
to
see
what
she
could
find
in
little
more
than
an
hour
burl
audience
had
diminished
to
saya
within
two
hours
ants
found
the
spider
where
it
had
been
placed
for
the
tribe
to
admire
within
three
hours
there
was
nothing
left
of
it
during
the
fourth
hour
as
burl
struggled
to
dredge
up
some
new
splendid
item
to
tell
saya
for
the
tenth
time
or
thereabouts
during
the
fourth
hour
one
of
the
tribeswomen
beckoned
to
saya
she
left
with
a
flashing
backward
smile
for
burl
she
went
actually
to
help
dig
up
underground
fungi
much
like
truffles
discovered
by
the
older
woman
she
undoubtedly
expected
to
share
them
with
burl
but
in
five
hours
it
was
night
and
burl
was
very
indignant
with
his
tribesfolk
they
had
shifted
the
location
of
the
for
the
night
and
nobody
had
thought
to
tell
him
and
if
saya
wished
to
come
for
burl
to
lead
him
to
that
place
she
did
not
dare
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
was
night
for
a
long
time
after
he
found
a
burl
fumed
bitterly
to
himself
he
was
very
much
of
a
human
being
differing
from
his
fellows
so
far
mainly
because
he
had
been
through
experiences
not
shared
by
them
he
had
resolved
a
subjective
dilemma
of
sorts
by
determining
to
return
to
his
tribe
he
had
discovered
a
weapon
which
at
first
had
promised
and
secured
foodstuff
and
later
had
saved
him
from
a
tarantula
his
discovery
that
was
useful
when
applied
to
and
things
sticking
to
the
feet
was
of
vast
importance
to
the
tribe
most
remarkable
of
all
he
had
deliberately
killed
a
spider
and
he
had
experienced
triumph
temporarily
he
had
even
experienced
admiration
the
adulation
was
a
thing
which
could
never
be
forgotten
human
appetites
are
formed
by
human
experiences
one
never
had
an
appetite
for
a
thing
one
has
not
known
in
some
fashion
but
no
human
being
who
has
known
triumph
is
ever
quite
the
same
again
and
anybody
who
has
once
been
admired
by
his
fellows
is
practically
ruined
for
life
at
least
so
far
as
being
independent
of
admiration
is
concerned
so
during
the
dark
hours
while
the
slow
rain
dipped
in
separate
heavy
drops
from
the
sky
burl
first
coddled
his
anger
which
was
a
very
good
thing
for
a
member
of
a
race
grown
timorous
and
furtive
and
then
began
to
make
indignant
plans
to
force
his
tribesmen
to
yield
him
more
of
the
delectable
sensations
he
alone
had
begun
to
know
he
was
not
especially
comfortable
during
the
night
the
he
had
chosen
was
not
water
trickled
over
him
for
several
hours
before
he
discovered
that
his
cloak
though
it
would
not
keep
him
dry
which
it
would
have
done
if
properly
disposed
would
still
keep
the
same
water
next
to
his
skin
where
his
body
could
warm
it
then
he
slept
when
morning
came
he
felt
singularly
refreshed
for
a
savage
he
was
unusually
clean
too
he
woke
before
dawn
with
vainglorious
schemes
in
his
head
the
sky
grew
gray
and
then
almost
white
the
overhanging
cloud
bank
seemed
almost
to
touch
the
earth
but
gradually
withdrew
the
mist
among
the
grew
thinner
and
the
slow
rain
ceased
reluctantly
when
he
peered
from
his
the
mad
world
he
knew
was
as
far
as
he
could
see
quite
mad
as
usual
the
last
of
the
had
vanished
the
began
to
venture
out
not
too
far
from
the
crevice
where
he
hidden
was
an
monstrous
by
standards
on
other
planets
it
was
piled
up
not
of
sand
but
gravel
and
small
boulders
burl
saw
a
stirring
at
a
certain
spot
the
smooth
outer
surface
crumbled
and
fell
into
an
invisible
opening
a
spot
of
darkness
appeared
two
slender
antennae
popped
out
they
withdrew
and
popped
out
again
the
spot
enlarged
until
there
was
a
sizeable
opening
an
ant
appeared
one
of
the
of
this
particular
breed
it
stood
fiercely
over
the
opening
waving
its
antennae
agitatedly
as
if
striving
to
sense
some
danger
to
its
metropolis
he
was
fourteen
inches
long
this
warrior
and
his
mandibles
were
fierce
and
strong
after
a
moment
two
other
warriors
thrust
past
him
they
ran
about
the
whole
extent
of
the
their
legs
clicking
antennae
waving
restlessly
they
returned
seeming
to
confer
with
the
first
then
went
back
down
into
the
city
with
every
appearance
of
satisfaction
as
if
they
made
a
properly
reassuring
report
within
minutes
afterward
a
flood
of
black
workers
poured
out
of
the
opening
and
dispersed
about
their
duties
the
city
of
the
ants
had
begun
its
daily
toil
there
were
deep
galleries
underground
here
graineries
refectories
and
nurseries
and
even
a
royal
apartment
in
which
the
reposed
she
was
waited
upon
by
assiduous
courtiers
fed
by
royal
stewards
and
combed
and
caressed
by
the
hands
of
her
subjects
and
children
a
dozen
times
larger
than
her
loyal
servants
she
was
no
less
industrious
than
they
in
her
highly
specialized
fashion
from
the
time
of
waking
to
the
time
of
rest
she
was
in
the
most
literal
imaginable
sense
at
intervals
to
be
measured
only
in
minutes
she
brought
forth
an
egg
perhaps
three
inches
in
length
which
was
whisked
away
to
the
municipal
nursery
and
this
constant
insensate
increase
in
the
population
of
the
city
made
all
its
frantic
industry
at
once
possible
and
necessary
burl
came
out
and
spread
his
cloak
on
the
ground
in
a
little
while
he
felt
a
tugging
at
it
an
ant
was
tearing
off
a
bit
of
the
hem
burl
slew
the
ant
angrily
and
retreated
twice
within
the
next
he
had
to
move
swiftly
to
avoid
foragers
who
would
not
directly
attack
him
because
he
was
alive
unless
he
seemed
to
threaten
danger
but
who
lusted
after
the
fabric
of
his
garments
this
annoyance
and
burl
would
merely
have
taken
it
as
a
thing
to
be
accepted
a
mere
two
days
before
this
annoyance
added
to
indignation
with
the
world
about
him
he
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
indeed
when
he
found
old
jon
wheezing
as
he
checked
on
the
possibility
of
there
being
edible
mushrooms
in
a
thicket
of
poisonous
amanitas
burl
haughtily
commanded
jon
to
follow
him
jon
untidy
whiskers
parted
as
his
mouth
dropped
open
in
astonishment
burl
tribe
was
so
far
from
being
really
a
tribe
that
for
anybody
to
give
a
command
was
astonishing
there
was
no
social
organization
absolutely
no
tradition
of
command
as
a
rule
life
was
too
uncertain
for
anybody
to
establish
authority
but
jon
followed
burl
as
he
stamped
on
through
the
morning
mist
he
saw
a
small
movement
and
shouted
imperatively
this
was
appalling
men
did
not
call
attention
to
themselves
he
gathered
up
dor
the
strongest
of
the
men
later
he
found
jak
who
some
day
would
wear
an
expression
of
wisdom
then
tet
and
dik
the
boys
came
trooping
to
see
what
was
happening
burl
led
onward
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
they
came
upon
a
great
gutted
shell
which
had
been
a
rhinoceros
beetle
the
day
before
today
it
was
a
disassembled
mass
of
chitinous
armor
burl
stopped
frowning
portentously
he
showed
his
quaking
followers
how
to
arm
themselves
dor
picked
up
the
horn
hesitantly
burl
showing
him
how
to
use
it
he
stabbed
out
awkwardly
with
the
sharp
fragment
of
armor
burl
showed
others
how
to
use
the
for
clubs
they
tested
them
without
conviction
in
any
sort
of
danger
they
would
trust
to
their
legs
and
a
frantically
effective
gift
for
hiding
burl
snarled
at
his
tribesmen
and
led
them
on
it
was
unprecedented
but
because
of
that
fact
there
was
no
precedent
for
rebellion
burl
led
them
in
a
curve
they
glanced
all
about
apprehensively
when
they
came
to
an
unusually
large
and
attractive
clump
of
golden
edible
mushrooms
there
were
murmurings
old
jon
was
inclined
to
go
and
load
himself
and
retire
to
some
for
as
long
as
the
food
lasted
but
burl
snarled
again
numbly
they
followed
on
dor
and
jon
and
jak
and
the
two
youngsters
the
ground
inclined
upward
they
came
upon
puffballs
there
was
a
new
kind
visible
colored
a
lurid
red
that
did
not
grow
like
the
others
it
seemed
to
begin
and
expand
underground
then
thrust
away
the
soil
above
in
its
development
its
taut
parchment
envelope
seemed
to
swell
from
a
reservoir
of
subterranean
material
burl
and
the
others
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
they
climbed
higher
as
other
edible
mushrooms
came
into
view
followers
cheered
visibly
this
was
a
new
tribal
ground
anyhow
and
it
had
not
been
fully
explored
but
burl
was
leading
them
to
quantities
of
food
they
had
never
suspected
before
quaintly
it
was
burl
himself
who
began
to
feel
an
uncomfortable
dryness
in
his
throat
he
knew
what
he
was
about
his
followers
did
not
suspect
because
to
them
what
he
intended
was
simply
inconceivable
they
suspect
it
because
they
could
imagine
anybody
doing
such
a
thing
it
simply
could
be
thought
of
at
all
it
is
rather
likely
that
burl
began
to
regret
that
he
had
thought
of
it
it
had
come
to
him
first
as
an
angry
notion
in
the
night
then
the
idea
had
developed
as
a
suitable
punishment
for
his
abandonment
by
dawn
it
was
an
ambition
so
terrifying
that
it
fascinated
him
now
he
was
committed
to
it
in
his
own
mind
and
the
only
way
to
keep
his
knees
from
knocking
together
was
to
keep
moving
if
his
followers
had
protested
now
he
would
have
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
but
he
heard
more
pleased
murmurs
there
was
more
edible
stuff
in
quantity
but
there
were
no
here
no
sounds
of
foraging
beetles
this
was
an
area
which
burl
tribesmen
could
clearly
see
was
almost
devoid
of
dangerous
life
they
seemed
to
brighten
a
little
this
they
seemed
to
think
would
be
a
good
place
to
move
to
but
burl
knew
better
there
were
few
here
because
the
area
was
hunted
out
and
burl
knew
what
had
done
the
hunting
he
expected
the
others
to
realize
where
they
were
when
they
dodged
around
a
clump
of
the
new
red
puffballs
and
saw
bald
rock
before
them
and
a
to
emptiness
beyond
even
then
they
could
have
retreated
but
it
did
not
enter
their
heads
that
burl
could
do
anything
like
this
they
did
know
where
they
were
until
burl
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
almost
at
the
edge
of
the
which
rose
a
hundred
feet
sheer
curving
out
a
little
near
its
top
they
looked
out
uncomprehendingly
at
the
air
and
the
nightmare
landscape
fading
into
its
grayness
a
tiny
spider
the
very
youngest
of
hatchlings
and
barely
four
inches
across
stealthily
stalked
another
vastly
smaller
mite
the
other
was
the
larva
of
the
the
larva
itself
had
been
called
on
other
planets
by
other
men
the
it
could
easily
hide
in
the
thick
furl
of
a
giant
but
this
one
small
creature
never
practiced
that
ability
the
hatchling
spider
sprang
and
the
small
midge
died
when
the
spider
had
grown
and
being
grown
spun
a
web
it
would
slay
great
crickets
with
the
same
insane
ferocity
burl
followers
saw
first
this
and
then
certain
strands
of
dirty
silk
that
came
up
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
as
one
man
after
another
realized
where
he
was
he
trembled
violently
dor
turned
gray
jon
and
jak
were
paralyzed
with
horror
they
could
run
seeing
the
others
even
more
frightened
than
himself
filled
burl
with
a
wholly
unwarranted
courage
when
he
opened
his
mouth
they
cringed
if
he
shouted
then
at
least
one
more
likely
several
of
them
would
die
and
this
was
because
some
forty
or
fifty
feet
down
the
precipice
hung
a
object
nearly
hemispherical
some
six
feet
in
its
a
number
of
little
doors
were
fixed
about
its
sides
like
arches
though
each
one
seemed
to
be
a
doorway
only
one
would
open
the
thing
had
been
oddly
beautiful
at
first
glance
it
was
held
fast
to
the
stone
by
cables
one
or
two
of
which
stretched
down
toward
the
ground
others
reached
up
over
the
to
hold
it
fast
it
was
a
most
unusual
engineering
feat
yet
something
more
than
that
this
was
also
an
ogre
castle
ghastly
trophies
were
fastened
to
the
outer
walls
and
hung
by
silken
cords
below
it
here
was
the
of
one
of
the
smaller
beetles
there
the
of
a
flying
creature
here
a
the
snails
of
earth
would
hardly
have
recognized
their
descendant
and
there
a
boulder
weighing
forty
pounds
or
more
the
shrunken
of
a
beetle
the
fierce
jaws
of
a
cricket
the
pitiful
shreds
of
dozens
of
creatures
all
had
once
provided
meals
for
the
monster
in
the
castle
and
dangling
by
the
longest
cord
of
all
was
the
shrunken
shriveled
body
of
a
man
burl
glared
at
his
tribesmen
clamping
his
jaws
tight
lest
they
chatter
he
knew
as
did
the
others
that
any
noise
would
bring
the
clotho
spider
swinging
up
its
to
the
the
men
did
dare
move
but
every
one
of
them
and
burl
was
among
the
foremost
knew
that
inside
the
of
gruesome
relics
the
monster
reposed
in
luxury
and
ease
it
had
eight
furry
attenuated
legs
and
a
face
that
was
a
mask
of
horror
the
eyes
glittered
malevolently
above
mandibles
it
was
a
at
any
moment
it
might
leave
the
in
which
it
lived
to
stalk
and
pursue
prey
burl
motioned
the
others
forward
he
led
one
of
them
to
the
end
of
a
cable
where
it
curled
up
over
the
edge
for
an
anchorage
he
ripped
the
end
free
and
his
flesh
crawled
as
he
did
so
he
found
a
boulder
and
knotted
the
end
of
the
cable
about
it
in
a
whisper
that
imitated
a
spider
ferocity
burl
gave
the
man
orders
he
plucked
a
second
quaking
tribesman
by
the
arm
with
the
jerky
uncontrolled
movements
of
a
robot
dor
allowed
himself
to
be
led
to
a
second
cable
burl
commanded
in
a
frenzy
he
worked
with
stiff
fingers
and
a
dry
throat
not
knowing
how
he
could
do
this
thing
he
had
formed
a
plan
in
anger
which
he
somehow
was
carrying
out
in
a
panic
although
his
followers
were
as
responsive
as
dead
men
they
obeyed
him
because
they
felt
like
dead
men
unable
to
resist
after
all
it
was
simple
enough
there
were
boulders
at
the
top
of
the
precipice
and
silken
cables
hung
taut
over
the
edge
as
burl
fastened
a
heavy
boulder
to
each
cable
he
could
find
he
loosened
the
silken
strand
until
it
hung
tight
only
at
the
very
edge
of
the
fall
he
took
his
post
and
his
followers
gazed
at
him
with
the
despairing
eyes
of
zombies
and
made
a
violent
urgent
gesture
one
man
dumped
his
boulder
over
the
precipice
edge
burl
cried
out
shrilly
to
the
others
with
his
own
terror
there
was
a
ripping
sound
the
other
men
dumped
their
boulders
over
fleeing
with
the
movement
the
paralysis
of
horror
relieved
by
that
one
bit
of
exertion
burl
could
not
flee
he
panted
and
gasped
but
he
had
to
see
he
stared
down
the
dizzy
wall
boulders
ripped
and
tore
their
way
down
the
pulling
the
cables
loose
from
the
face
of
the
precipice
they
shot
out
into
space
and
jerked
violently
at
the
nest
ripping
it
loose
from
its
anchorage
burl
cried
out
exultantly
and
as
he
cried
out
the
shout
became
a
bubbling
sound
for
although
the
ogre
silken
castle
did
swing
clear
it
did
not
drop
the
sixty
feet
to
the
hard
ground
below
there
was
one
cable
burl
had
missed
hidden
by
and
mould
in
a
depressed
part
of
the
the
spider
house
was
dangling
crazily
by
that
one
strand
bobbing
erratically
to
and
fro
in
and
there
was
a
convulsive
struggle
inside
it
one
of
the
opened
and
the
spider
emerged
it
was
doubtless
confused
but
spiders
simply
do
not
know
terror
their
one
response
to
the
unusual
is
ferocity
there
was
still
one
cable
leading
up
the
the
thing
normal
to
its
above
the
spider
leaped
for
this
single
cable
its
legs
grasped
the
cord
it
swarmed
upward
poison
fangs
unsheathed
mandibles
clashing
in
rage
the
shaggy
hair
of
its
body
seemed
to
bristle
with
insane
ferocity
the
skinny
articulated
legs
fairly
twinkled
as
it
rose
it
made
slavering
noises
unspeakably
horrifying
burl
followers
were
already
in
flight
he
could
hear
them
crashing
through
obstacles
as
they
ran
from
the
horror
they
only
imagined
but
which
burl
could
not
but
encounter
burl
shivered
his
body
poised
for
equally
frenzied
but
quite
hopeless
flight
but
his
first
step
was
blocked
there
was
a
boulder
behind
him
standing
on
end
reaching
up
to
his
knee
he
could
not
take
the
first
step
without
dodging
it
it
was
not
the
burl
of
the
childhood
who
acted
then
it
was
the
the
atavism
to
a
bolder
ancestry
while
the
burl
who
was
a
product
of
his
environment
was
able
to
know
only
the
stunned
sensations
of
purest
panic
the
other
burl
acted
on
a
sounder
basis
of
desperation
the
emerging
normal
human
seized
the
upright
boulder
he
staggered
to
the
with
it
he
dumped
it
down
the
line
of
the
descending
cable
humans
do
have
ancestral
built
into
their
nervous
systems
a
frightened
small
child
does
not
flee
it
swarms
up
the
nearest
adult
to
be
carried
away
from
danger
at
ten
a
child
does
not
climb
but
runs
and
there
is
an
age
when
it
is
normal
for
a
man
to
stand
at
bay
this
last
instinct
can
be
conditioned
away
in
burl
fellows
and
his
immediate
forbears
it
had
been
but
things
had
happened
to
burl
to
break
that
conditioning
he
flung
the
pointed
boulder
down
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
heard
only
the
bubbling
gnashing
sounds
the
spider
made
as
it
climbed
toward
him
then
there
was
a
quite
indescribable
cushioned
impact
after
that
there
were
seconds
in
which
burl
heard
nothing
whatever
and
then
a
noise
which
could
not
be
described
either
but
was
the
impact
of
the
spider
body
on
the
ground
a
hundred
feet
below
together
with
the
pointed
boulder
it
had
fought
insanely
during
all
its
fall
and
the
boulder
was
on
top
the
noise
was
sickening
burl
found
himself
shaking
all
over
his
every
muscle
was
tense
and
strained
but
the
spider
did
not
crawl
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
something
had
hit
far
below
a
long
minute
later
he
managed
to
look
the
nest
still
dangled
at
the
end
of
the
single
cable
festooned
with
its
gruesome
trophies
but
burl
saw
the
spider
it
was
of
course
characteristically
tenacious
of
life
its
legs
writhed
and
kicked
but
the
body
was
crushed
and
mangled
as
burl
stared
down
trying
to
breathe
again
an
ant
drew
near
the
shattered
creature
it
stridulated
other
ants
came
they
hovered
restlessly
at
the
edge
of
the
one
loathesome
leg
did
not
quiver
an
ant
moved
in
on
it
the
ants
began
to
tear
the
dead
spider
apart
carrying
its
fragments
to
their
city
a
mile
away
up
on
the
burl
got
unsteadily
to
his
feet
and
found
that
he
could
breathe
he
was
drenched
in
sweat
but
the
shock
of
triumph
was
as
overwhelming
as
any
of
the
terrors
felt
by
ancestors
on
this
planet
on
no
other
planet
in
the
galaxy
could
any
human
experience
such
triumph
as
burl
felt
now
because
never
before
had
human
beings
been
so
completely
subjugated
by
their
environment
on
no
other
planet
had
such
an
environment
existed
with
humans
flung
so
helplessly
upon
its
mercy
burl
had
been
normal
among
his
fellows
when
he
was
as
frightened
and
furtive
as
they
now
he
had
been
given
shock
treatment
by
fate
he
was
very
close
to
normal
for
a
human
being
newly
come
to
the
forgotten
planet
save
that
he
had
the
detailed
information
which
would
enable
a
normal
man
to
cope
with
the
nightmare
environment
what
he
lacked
now
was
the
habit
but
it
would
be
intolerable
for
him
to
return
to
his
former
state
of
mind
he
walked
almost
thoughtfully
after
his
fled
followers
and
he
was
still
a
savage
in
that
he
was
remarkably
he
paused
to
break
off
a
huge
piece
of
the
edible
golden
mushrooms
his
had
noticed
on
the
way
up
lugging
it
easily
he
went
back
down
over
the
ground
that
had
looked
so
astonishingly
free
of
inimical
life
which
it
was
because
of
the
spider
that
had
used
it
as
a
burl
began
to
see
that
it
was
not
satisfactory
to
be
one
of
a
tribe
of
men
who
ran
away
all
the
time
if
one
man
with
a
spear
or
stone
could
kill
spiders
it
was
ridiculous
for
half
a
dozen
men
to
run
away
and
leave
that
one
man
the
job
alone
it
made
the
job
harder
it
occurred
to
burl
that
he
had
killed
ants
without
thinking
too
much
about
it
but
nobody
else
had
individual
ants
could
be
killed
if
he
got
his
followers
to
kill
ants
they
might
in
time
battle
the
smaller
beetles
if
they
came
to
dare
so
much
they
might
attack
greater
creatures
and
ultimately
attempt
to
resist
the
real
predators
not
clearly
but
very
dimly
the
burl
who
had
been
shocked
back
to
the
viewpoint
which
was
normal
to
the
race
of
men
saw
that
human
beings
could
be
more
than
the
fugitive
vermin
on
which
other
creatures
preyed
it
was
not
easy
to
envision
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
imagine
sinking
back
to
his
former
state
as
a
practical
matter
if
he
was
to
remain
as
leader
his
tribesmen
would
have
to
change
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
reached
the
neighborhood
of
the
of
which
he
had
not
been
told
the
night
before
he
sniffed
and
listened
presently
he
heard
faint
murmurous
noises
he
traced
them
hearing
clearly
the
sound
of
hushed
weeping
and
excited
timid
chattering
he
heard
old
tama
shrilly
bewailing
fate
and
the
stupidity
of
burl
in
getting
himself
killed
he
pushed
boldly
through
the
and
found
his
tribe
all
gathered
together
and
trembling
they
were
shaken
they
chattered
together
not
discussing
or
planning
but
nervously
recalling
the
terrifying
experience
they
had
gone
through
burl
stepped
through
the
screen
of
fungi
and
men
gaped
at
him
then
they
leaped
up
to
flee
thinking
he
might
be
pursued
tet
and
dik
babbled
shrilly
burl
cuffed
them
it
was
an
excellent
thing
for
him
to
do
no
man
had
struck
another
man
in
burl
memory
cuffings
were
reserved
for
children
but
burl
cuffed
the
men
who
had
fled
from
the
and
because
they
had
not
been
through
burl
experiences
they
took
the
cuffings
like
children
he
took
jon
and
jak
by
the
ear
and
heaved
them
out
of
the
he
followed
them
and
then
drove
them
to
where
they
could
see
the
base
of
the
cliff
from
whose
top
they
had
tumbled
stones
and
then
run
away
he
showed
them
the
carcass
of
the
spider
now
being
carted
away
piecemeal
by
ants
he
told
them
angrily
how
it
had
been
killed
they
looked
at
him
fearfully
he
was
exasperated
he
scowled
at
them
and
then
he
saw
them
shifting
uneasily
there
were
clickings
a
single
foraging
black
ant
rather
large
quite
sixteen
inches
long
moved
into
view
it
seemed
to
be
wandering
purposelessly
but
was
actually
seeking
carrion
to
take
back
to
its
fellows
it
moved
toward
the
men
they
were
alive
therefore
it
did
not
think
of
them
as
food
though
it
could
regard
them
as
enemies
burl
moved
forward
and
struck
with
his
club
it
was
butchery
it
was
unprecedented
when
the
creature
lay
still
he
commanded
one
of
his
typo
for
followers
to
take
it
up
inside
its
armored
legs
there
would
be
meat
he
mentioned
the
fact
pungently
their
faces
expressed
amazed
wonderment
there
was
another
clicking
another
solitary
ant
burl
handed
his
club
to
dor
pushing
him
forward
dor
hesitated
though
he
was
not
afraid
of
one
wandering
ant
he
held
back
uneasily
burl
barked
at
him
dor
struck
clumsily
and
botched
the
job
burl
had
to
use
his
spear
to
finish
it
but
a
second
bit
of
prey
lay
before
the
men
then
quite
suddenly
this
completely
unprecedented
form
of
foraging
became
understandable
to
burl
followers
jak
giggled
nervously
an
hour
later
burl
led
them
back
to
the
tribe
the
others
had
been
not
knowing
where
the
men
had
gone
but
their
terror
changed
to
mute
amazement
when
the
men
carried
huge
quantities
of
meat
and
edible
mushroom
into
the
the
tribe
held
what
amounted
to
a
banquet
dik
and
tet
swaggered
under
a
burden
of
this
was
not
of
course
in
any
way
revolting
back
on
earth
even
thousands
of
years
before
arabs
had
eaten
locusts
cooked
in
butter
and
salted
all
men
had
eaten
crabs
and
other
crustaceans
whose
feeding
habits
were
similar
to
those
of
ants
if
burl
and
his
tribesmen
had
thought
to
be
fastidious
ants
on
the
forgotten
planet
would
still
have
been
considered
edible
since
they
had
not
lost
the
habits
of
extreme
cleanliness
which
made
them
notable
on
earth
this
feast
of
all
the
tribe
in
which
men
had
brought
back
not
only
mushroom
to
be
eaten
but
actual
prey
small
prey
of
their
hunting
was
very
probably
the
first
such
occasion
in
at
least
thirty
generations
of
the
since
the
planet
unintended
colonization
like
the
other
events
which
began
with
burl
trying
to
spear
a
fish
with
a
horn
it
was
not
only
novel
on
that
world
but
would
in
time
have
almost
incredibly
consequences
perhaps
the
most
significant
thing
about
it
was
its
timing
it
came
at
very
nearly
the
latest
instant
at
which
it
could
have
done
any
good
there
was
a
reason
which
nobody
in
the
tribe
would
ever
remember
to
associate
with
the
significance
of
this
banquet
a
long
time
before
months
in
terms
of
there
had
been
a
strong
breeze
that
blew
for
three
days
and
nights
it
was
an
extremely
unusual
windstorm
it
had
seemed
the
stranger
then
because
during
all
its
duration
everyone
in
the
tribe
had
been
sick
suffering
continuously
when
the
windstorm
had
ended
the
suffering
ceased
a
long
time
passed
and
nobody
remembered
it
any
longer
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
yet
since
that
time
there
had
been
a
new
kind
of
thing
growing
among
the
innumerable
moulds
and
rusts
and
toadstools
of
the
lowlands
burl
had
seen
them
on
his
travels
and
the
expeditionary
force
against
the
clotho
spider
had
seen
them
on
the
journey
up
to
the
red
puffballs
developing
first
underground
were
now
pushing
the
soil
aside
to
expose
taut
crimson
parchment
spheres
to
the
open
air
the
tribesmen
left
them
alone
because
they
were
strange
and
strange
things
were
always
dangerous
puffballs
they
were
familiar
with
big
misshapen
things
which
shot
at
a
touch
a
powder
into
the
air
the
particles
of
powder
were
spores
the
seed
from
which
they
grew
spores
had
remained
infinitely
small
even
on
the
forgotten
planet
where
fungi
grew
huge
only
their
capacity
for
growth
had
increased
the
red
growths
were
puffballs
but
of
a
new
and
different
kind
as
the
tribe
ate
and
admired
the
hunters
boasting
of
their
courage
one
of
the
new
red
mushrooms
reached
maturity
this
particular
growing
thing
was
perhaps
two
feet
across
its
main
part
spherical
almost
eighteen
inches
of
the
thing
rose
a
tawny
and
menacing
red
the
sphere
was
contained
in
a
skin
that
was
pulled
taut
there
was
internal
tension
but
the
skin
was
tough
and
would
not
yield
yet
the
inexorable
pressure
of
life
within
demanded
that
it
stretch
it
was
growing
within
but
the
skin
without
had
ceased
to
grow
this
one
happened
to
be
on
a
low
hillside
a
good
from
the
place
where
burl
and
his
fellows
banqueted
its
tough
red
parchment
skin
was
tensed
unendurably
suddenly
it
ripped
apart
with
an
explosive
tearing
noise
the
dry
spores
within
billowed
out
and
up
like
the
smoke
of
a
spurting
skyward
for
twenty
feet
and
more
at
the
top
of
their
ascent
they
spread
out
and
eddied
like
a
cloud
of
reddish
smoke
they
hung
in
the
air
they
drifted
in
the
sluggish
breeze
they
spread
as
they
floated
forming
a
gradually
extending
descending
in
the
humid
air
a
bee
flying
back
toward
its
hive
droned
into
the
thin
mass
of
dust
it
was
preoccupied
the
was
not
opaque
but
only
a
thick
haze
the
bee
flew
into
it
for
half
a
dozen
nothing
happened
then
the
bee
veered
sharply
its
humming
rose
in
pitch
it
made
convulsive
movements
in
it
lost
balance
and
crashed
heavily
to
the
ground
there
its
legs
kicked
and
heaved
violently
but
without
purpose
the
wings
beat
furiously
but
without
rhythm
or
effect
its
body
bent
in
paroxysmic
flexings
it
stung
blindly
at
nothing
after
a
little
while
the
bee
died
like
all
insects
bees
breathe
through
spiracles
in
their
abdomens
this
bee
had
flown
into
the
cloud
of
red
dust
which
was
the
of
the
new
mushrooms
the
cloud
drifted
slowly
along
over
the
surface
of
yeasts
and
moulds
over
toadstools
and
variegated
fungus
monstrosities
it
moved
steadily
over
a
group
of
ants
at
work
upon
some
bit
of
edible
stuff
they
were
seized
with
an
affliction
like
that
of
the
bee
they
writhed
moved
convulsively
their
legs
thrashed
about
they
died
the
cloud
of
red
dust
settled
as
it
moved
by
the
time
it
had
travelled
a
it
had
almost
all
settled
to
the
ground
but
a
away
there
was
another
uprush
of
red
dust
which
spread
slowly
with
the
breeze
a
away
another
plumed
into
the
air
farther
on
two
of
them
spouted
their
spores
toward
the
clouds
almost
together
living
things
that
breathed
the
red
dust
writhed
and
died
and
the
puffballs
were
scattered
everywhere
burl
and
his
tribesmen
feasted
chattering
in
hushed
tones
of
the
remarkable
fact
that
men
ate
meat
of
their
own
killing
red
it
was
very
fortunate
indeed
that
the
feast
took
place
when
it
did
two
days
later
it
would
probably
have
been
impossible
and
three
days
later
it
would
have
been
too
late
to
do
any
good
but
coming
when
it
did
it
made
the
difference
which
was
all
the
difference
in
the
world
only
thirty
hours
after
the
feasting
which
followed
the
death
of
the
clotho
spider
burl
fellows
from
jon
to
dor
to
tet
and
dik
and
saya
had
come
to
know
a
numb
despair
which
the
other
creatures
of
his
world
were
simply
a
bit
too
stupid
to
achieve
it
was
night
there
was
darkness
over
all
the
lowlands
and
over
all
the
area
of
perhaps
a
hundred
square
miles
which
the
humans
of
acquaintance
really
knew
he
alone
of
his
tribe
had
been
as
much
as
forty
miles
from
the
over
which
they
wandered
at
any
given
time
the
tribe
clung
together
for
comfort
venturing
only
as
far
as
was
necessary
to
find
food
although
the
planet
possessed
continents
they
knew
less
than
a
county
of
it
the
planet
owned
oceans
and
they
knew
only
small
brooks
and
one
river
which
where
they
knew
it
was
assuredly
less
than
two
hundred
yards
across
and
they
faced
stark
disaster
that
was
not
strictly
a
local
one
but
beyond
their
experience
and
hopelessly
beyond
their
ability
to
face
they
were
superior
to
the
insects
about
them
only
in
the
fact
they
realized
what
was
threatening
them
the
disaster
was
the
red
puffballs
but
it
was
night
the
soft
blanketing
darkness
of
a
world
lay
all
about
burl
sat
awake
wrapped
in
his
magnificent
velvet
cloak
his
spear
beside
him
and
the
golden
plumes
of
a
antennae
bound
to
his
forehead
for
a
headdress
about
him
and
his
tribesmen
were
the
swollen
shapes
of
fungi
hiding
the
few
things
that
could
be
seen
in
darkness
from
the
clouds
the
nightly
rain
dripped
down
now
a
drop
and
then
another
drop
slowly
deliberately
persistently
moisture
fell
from
the
skies
there
was
other
sounds
things
flew
through
the
blackness
overhead
moths
with
mighty
that
sometimes
sent
rhythmic
down
to
the
tribe
in
its
there
were
the
deep
pulsations
of
sound
made
by
aloft
there
were
the
harsh
noises
of
grasshoppers
they
were
rare
senselessly
advertising
their
existence
to
nearby
predators
not
too
far
from
where
burl
brooded
came
bright
chirrupings
where
relatively
small
beetles
roamed
among
the
singing
cheerfully
in
deep
bass
voices
they
were
searching
for
the
underground
tidbits
which
took
the
place
of
truffles
their
ancestors
had
lived
on
back
on
earth
all
seemed
to
be
as
it
had
been
since
the
first
humans
were
cast
away
upon
this
planet
and
at
night
indeed
the
new
danger
subsided
the
red
puffballs
did
not
burst
after
sunset
burl
sat
awake
brooding
in
a
new
sort
of
frustration
he
and
all
his
tribe
were
plainly
doomed
yet
burl
had
experienced
too
many
satisfying
sensations
lately
to
be
willing
to
accept
the
fact
the
new
red
growths
were
everywhere
months
ago
a
blew
while
somewhere
not
too
far
distant
other
red
puffballs
were
bursting
and
sending
their
spores
into
the
air
since
it
was
only
a
windstorm
there
was
no
rain
to
wash
the
air
clean
of
the
lethal
dust
the
new
kind
of
puffball
but
perhaps
it
was
not
new
it
could
have
thriven
for
thousands
of
years
where
it
was
first
thrown
as
a
sport
from
a
genetically
unstable
parent
the
new
kind
of
puffball
would
not
normally
be
spread
in
this
fashion
by
chance
it
had
there
were
dozens
of
the
things
within
a
hundreds
within
a
mile
and
thousands
upon
thousands
within
the
area
the
tribe
normally
foraged
in
burl
had
seen
them
even
forty
miles
away
as
yet
immature
they
would
be
deadly
at
one
period
alone
the
time
of
their
bursting
but
there
were
limitations
even
to
the
deadliness
of
the
red
puffballs
though
burl
had
not
yet
discovered
the
fact
but
as
of
now
they
doomed
the
tribe
one
woman
panted
and
moaned
in
her
exhausted
sleep
a
little
way
from
where
burl
tried
to
solve
the
problem
presented
by
the
tribe
nobody
else
attempted
to
think
it
out
the
others
accepted
doom
with
fatalistic
hopelessness
burl
leadership
might
mean
extra
food
but
nothing
could
counter
the
doom
awaiting
them
so
their
thoughts
seemed
to
run
but
burl
doggedly
reviewed
the
facts
in
the
darkness
while
the
humans
about
him
slept
the
sleep
of
those
without
hope
and
even
without
rebellion
there
had
been
many
burstings
of
the
crimson
puffballs
as
many
as
four
and
five
of
the
deadly
had
been
seen
spouting
into
the
air
at
the
same
time
a
small
boy
of
the
tribe
had
breathlessly
told
of
seeing
a
killed
by
the
red
dust
lana
the
girl
had
come
upon
one
of
the
gigantic
on
the
ground
already
the
prey
of
ants
she
had
snatched
a
huge
joint
and
run
away
faster
than
the
ants
could
follow
a
man
had
seen
a
butterfly
with
wings
ten
yards
across
die
in
a
another
woman
cori
had
been
nearby
when
a
red
cloud
settled
slowly
over
long
solid
lines
of
black
bound
on
some
unknown
mission
later
she
saw
other
workers
carrying
the
dead
bodies
back
to
the
to
be
used
for
food
burl
still
sat
wakeful
and
frustrated
and
enraged
as
the
slow
rain
fell
upon
the
toadstools
that
formed
the
tribe
he
doggedly
went
over
and
over
the
problem
there
were
innumerable
red
puffballs
some
had
burst
the
others
undoubtedly
would
burst
anything
that
breathed
the
red
dust
died
with
thousands
of
the
puffballs
around
them
it
was
unthinkable
that
any
human
in
this
place
could
escape
breathing
the
red
dust
and
dying
but
it
had
not
always
been
so
there
had
been
a
time
when
there
were
no
red
puffballs
here
burl
eyes
moved
restlessly
over
the
sleeping
forms
limned
by
a
patch
of
the
feathery
plumes
rising
from
his
head
were
outlined
softly
by
the
phosphorescence
his
face
was
lined
with
a
frown
as
he
tried
to
think
his
own
and
his
fellows
way
out
of
the
predicament
without
realizing
it
burl
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
think
for
his
tribe
he
had
no
reason
to
it
was
simply
a
natural
thing
for
him
to
do
so
now
that
he
had
learned
to
think
even
though
his
efforts
were
crude
and
painful
as
yet
saya
woke
with
a
start
and
stared
about
there
had
been
no
alarm
merely
the
usual
noises
of
distant
murders
and
the
songs
of
singers
in
the
night
burl
moved
restlessly
saya
stood
up
quietly
her
long
hair
flowing
about
her
she
moved
to
be
near
burl
she
sank
to
the
ground
beside
him
sitting
up
because
the
was
crowded
and
small
and
dozed
fitfully
presently
her
head
drooped
to
one
side
it
rested
against
his
shoulder
she
slept
again
this
simple
act
may
have
been
the
catalyst
which
gave
burl
the
solution
to
the
problem
some
few
days
before
burl
had
been
in
a
place
where
there
was
much
food
at
the
time
he
thought
vaguely
of
finding
saya
and
bringing
her
to
that
place
he
remembered
now
that
the
red
puffballs
flourished
there
as
well
as
here
but
there
had
been
other
dangers
in
between
so
the
only
purpose
had
been
abandoned
now
though
with
saya
head
resting
against
his
shoulder
he
remembered
the
plan
and
then
the
stroke
of
genius
took
place
he
formed
the
idea
of
a
journey
which
was
not
a
this
present
of
the
tribe
had
been
free
of
red
puffballs
until
only
recently
there
must
be
other
places
where
there
were
no
red
puffballs
he
would
take
saya
and
his
tribesmen
to
such
a
place
it
was
really
genius
the
people
of
burl
tribe
had
no
purposes
only
needs
for
food
and
the
like
burl
had
achieved
abstract
thought
which
previously
had
not
been
useful
on
the
forgotten
planet
and
therefore
not
practised
but
it
was
time
for
humankind
to
take
a
more
fitting
place
in
the
unbalanced
ecological
system
of
this
nightmare
world
time
to
change
that
unbalance
in
favor
of
humans
when
dawn
came
burl
had
not
slept
at
all
he
was
all
authority
and
decision
he
had
made
plans
he
spoke
sternly
loudly
which
frightened
people
conditioned
to
be
furtive
holding
up
his
spear
as
he
issued
commands
his
timid
tribesfolk
obeyed
him
meekly
they
felt
no
loyalty
to
him
or
confidence
in
his
decisions
yet
but
they
were
beginning
to
associate
obedience
to
him
with
good
things
food
for
one
before
the
day
fully
came
they
made
loads
of
the
remaining
edible
mushroom
and
uneaten
meat
it
was
remarkable
for
humans
to
leave
their
while
they
still
had
food
to
eat
but
burl
was
implacable
and
scowling
three
men
bore
spears
at
burl
urging
he
brandished
his
long
shaft
confidently
as
he
persuaded
the
other
three
to
carry
clubs
they
did
so
reluctantly
even
though
previously
they
had
killed
ants
with
clubs
spears
they
felt
would
have
been
better
they
would
be
so
close
to
the
prey
then
the
sky
became
gray
over
all
its
expanse
the
indefinite
bright
area
which
marked
the
position
of
the
sun
became
established
it
was
toward
the
center
of
the
sky
when
the
journey
began
burl
had
of
course
no
determined
course
only
a
destination
safety
he
had
been
carried
south
in
his
misadventure
on
the
river
there
were
red
puffballs
to
southward
therefore
he
ruled
out
that
direction
he
could
have
chosen
the
east
and
come
upon
an
ocean
but
no
safety
from
the
red
or
he
could
have
chosen
the
north
it
was
pure
chance
that
he
headed
west
he
walked
confidently
through
the
gruesome
world
of
the
lowlands
holding
his
spear
in
a
semblance
of
readiness
clad
as
he
was
he
made
a
figure
at
once
valiant
and
rather
pathetic
it
was
not
too
sensible
for
one
young
man
even
one
who
had
killed
two
spiders
to
essay
leading
a
tiny
tribe
of
fearful
folk
across
a
land
of
monstrous
ferocity
and
incredible
malignance
armed
only
with
a
spear
from
a
dead
armor
it
was
absurd
to
dress
up
for
the
enterprise
in
a
velvety
cloak
made
of
a
moth
wing
blue
for
a
and
merely
beautiful
golden
plumes
bobbing
above
his
forehead
probably
though
that
gorgeousness
had
a
good
effect
upon
his
followers
they
surely
could
not
reassure
each
other
by
their
numbers
there
was
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
cori
three
children
of
nine
or
ten
unable
to
resist
the
instinct
to
play
even
on
so
perilous
a
journey
ate
almost
constantly
of
the
lumps
of
foodstuff
they
had
been
ordered
to
carry
after
them
came
dik
a
adolescent
boy
with
eyes
that
roved
anxiously
about
behind
him
were
two
men
dor
with
a
short
spear
and
jak
hefting
a
club
both
of
them
badly
frightened
at
the
idea
of
fleeing
from
dangers
they
knew
and
were
terrified
by
to
other
dangers
unknown
and
consequently
more
to
be
feared
the
others
trailed
after
them
tet
was
burl
had
separated
the
pair
of
boys
to
make
them
useful
together
they
were
worthless
it
was
a
pathetic
caravan
in
a
way
in
all
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
man
was
the
dominant
creature
there
was
no
other
planet
from
one
rim
to
the
other
where
men
did
not
build
their
cities
or
settlements
with
unconscious
arrogance
completely
disregarding
the
wishes
of
lesser
things
only
on
this
planet
did
men
hide
from
danger
rather
than
destroy
it
only
here
could
men
be
driven
from
their
place
by
lower
and
only
here
would
a
migration
be
made
on
foot
with
men
eyes
fearful
their
bodies
poised
to
flee
at
sight
of
something
stronger
and
more
deadly
than
themselves
they
marched
straggling
a
little
with
many
waverings
aside
from
a
fixed
line
once
dik
saw
the
of
a
lair
they
halted
trembling
and
went
a
long
way
out
of
their
intended
path
to
avoid
it
once
they
saw
a
great
a
good
off
and
again
they
deviated
from
their
proper
route
near
midday
their
way
was
blocked
as
they
moved
onward
a
great
sound
could
be
heard
ahead
of
them
burl
stopped
his
face
grew
pinched
but
it
was
only
a
stridulation
not
the
cries
of
creatures
being
devoured
it
was
a
horde
of
ants
by
the
thousands
and
hundreds
of
thousands
and
nothing
else
burl
went
ahead
to
scout
and
he
did
it
because
he
did
not
trust
anybody
else
to
have
the
courage
or
intelligence
to
return
with
a
report
instead
of
simply
running
away
if
the
news
were
bad
but
it
happened
to
be
a
sort
of
action
which
would
help
to
establish
his
position
as
leader
of
his
tribe
burl
moved
forward
cautiously
and
presently
came
to
an
elevation
from
which
he
could
see
the
cause
of
the
tremendous
waves
of
sound
that
spread
out
in
all
directions
from
the
level
plain
before
him
he
waved
to
his
followers
to
join
him
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
extraordinary
sight
when
they
reached
his
side
and
saya
was
first
the
spectacle
had
not
diminished
for
quite
half
a
mile
in
either
direction
the
earth
was
black
with
ants
it
was
a
battle
of
opposing
armies
from
rival
they
snapped
and
bit
at
each
other
locked
in
embraces
they
rolled
over
and
over
upon
the
ground
trampled
underfoot
by
hordes
of
their
fellows
who
surged
over
them
to
engage
in
equally
suicidal
combat
there
was
of
course
no
thought
of
surrender
or
of
quarter
they
fought
by
thousands
of
pairs
their
jaws
seeking
to
crush
each
other
armor
snapping
at
each
other
antennae
biting
at
each
other
eyes
the
noise
was
not
like
that
of
this
was
the
agonizing
sound
of
ants
being
dismembered
while
still
alive
some
of
the
creatures
had
only
one
or
two
or
three
legs
left
yet
struggled
fiercely
to
entangle
another
enemy
before
they
died
there
were
mad
cripples
fighting
insanely
with
head
and
thorax
only
their
abdomens
sheared
away
the
whining
of
the
multitude
made
a
deafening
uproar
from
either
side
of
the
battleground
a
wide
path
led
back
toward
separate
which
were
invisible
from
burl
position
these
highways
were
marked
by
hurrying
groups
of
ants
reinforcements
rushing
to
the
fight
compared
to
the
other
creatures
of
this
world
the
ants
were
small
but
no
lumbering
beetle
dared
to
march
insolently
in
their
way
nor
did
any
carnivores
try
to
prey
upon
them
they
were
dangerous
burl
and
his
tribesfolk
were
the
only
living
things
remaining
near
the
with
one
single
exception
that
exception
was
itself
a
tribe
of
ants
vastly
less
in
number
than
the
fighting
creatures
and
greatly
smaller
in
size
as
well
where
the
combatants
were
from
a
foot
to
fourteen
inches
long
these
were
no
more
than
the
third
of
a
foot
in
length
they
hovered
industriously
at
the
edge
of
the
fighting
not
as
allies
to
either
nation
but
strictly
on
their
own
account
scurrying
among
the
larger
fighting
ants
with
marvelous
agility
they
carried
off
piecemeal
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
valiantly
slew
the
more
gravely
wounded
for
the
same
purpose
they
swarmed
over
the
whenever
the
tide
of
battle
receded
caring
nothing
for
the
origin
of
the
quarrel
and
espousing
neither
side
these
opportunists
busily
salvaged
the
dead
and
debris
of
the
battle
for
their
own
purposes
burl
and
his
followers
were
forced
to
make
a
detour
to
avoid
the
battle
the
passage
between
bodies
of
scurrying
reinforcements
was
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
burl
hurried
the
others
past
a
route
to
the
front
reeking
of
formic
acid
over
which
endless
regiments
and
companies
of
ants
moved
frantically
to
join
in
the
fight
they
were
intensely
excited
antennae
waving
wildly
they
rushed
to
the
front
and
instantly
flung
themselves
into
the
fray
becoming
lost
and
indistinguishable
in
the
black
mass
of
fighting
creatures
the
humans
passed
precariously
between
two
hurrying
battalions
dik
and
tet
pausing
briefly
to
burden
themselves
with
prey
and
hurried
on
to
leave
as
many
miles
as
possible
behind
them
before
nightfall
they
never
knew
any
more
about
the
battle
it
could
have
started
over
anything
at
all
two
ants
from
the
different
cities
may
have
disputed
some
tiny
bit
of
carrion
and
soon
been
reinforced
by
companions
until
the
military
might
of
both
cities
was
engaged
once
it
had
started
of
course
the
fighters
knew
whom
to
fight
if
not
why
they
did
so
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
cities
had
different
smells
which
served
them
as
uniforms
but
the
outcome
of
the
war
would
hardly
matter
not
to
the
fighters
certainly
there
were
many
red
mushrooms
in
this
area
if
either
of
the
cities
survived
at
all
it
would
be
because
its
lived
upon
stored
food
as
they
tended
the
grubs
until
the
time
of
the
spouting
red
dust
had
ended
burl
folk
saw
many
of
the
red
puffballs
burst
during
the
day
more
than
once
they
came
upon
empty
flaccid
parchment
sacs
more
often
still
they
came
upon
red
puffballs
not
yet
quite
ready
to
emit
their
murderous
seed
that
first
night
the
tribe
hid
among
the
bases
of
giant
puffballs
of
a
more
familiar
sort
when
touched
they
would
shoot
out
a
puff
of
white
powder
resembling
smoke
the
powder
was
harmless
fortunately
and
the
tribe
knew
that
fact
although
not
toxic
the
white
powder
was
identical
in
every
other
way
to
the
terrible
red
dust
from
which
the
tribe
fled
that
night
burl
slept
soundly
he
had
been
without
rest
for
two
days
and
a
night
and
he
was
experienced
in
journeying
to
remote
places
he
knew
that
they
were
no
more
dangerous
than
familiar
ones
but
the
rest
of
the
tribe
and
even
saya
were
fearful
and
terrified
they
waited
timorously
all
through
the
dark
hours
for
menacing
sounds
to
crash
suddenly
through
the
steady
dripping
of
the
nightly
rain
around
them
the
second
day
journey
was
not
unlike
the
first
the
following
day
they
came
upon
a
full
patch
of
giant
cabbages
bigger
than
a
family
dwelling
something
in
the
soil
perhaps
favored
vegetation
over
fungi
the
dozens
of
monstrous
vegetables
were
the
setting
for
riotous
life
great
slugs
ate
endlessly
of
the
huge
green
leaves
and
things
preyed
on
them
bees
came
droning
to
gather
the
pollen
of
the
flowers
and
other
things
came
to
prey
on
the
predators
in
their
turn
there
was
one
great
cabbage
somewhat
separate
from
the
rest
after
a
long
examination
of
the
scene
burl
daringly
led
quaking
jon
and
jak
to
the
attack
dor
splendidly
attacked
elsewhere
alone
when
the
tribe
moved
on
there
was
much
meat
and
everyone
even
the
children
wore
of
incredibly
luxurious
fur
there
were
perils
too
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
tribe
journey
burl
suddenly
froze
into
stillness
one
of
the
hairy
tarantulas
which
lived
in
burrows
with
a
concealed
at
had
fallen
upon
a
scarabeus
beetle
and
was
devouring
it
only
a
hundred
yards
ahead
the
tribesfolk
trembled
as
burl
led
them
silently
back
and
around
by
a
safe
detour
but
all
these
experiences
were
beginning
to
have
an
effect
it
was
becoming
a
matter
of
course
that
burl
should
give
orders
which
others
should
obey
it
was
even
becoming
that
the
possession
of
food
was
not
a
beautiful
excuse
to
hide
from
all
danger
eating
and
dozing
until
all
the
food
was
gone
very
gradually
the
tribe
was
developing
the
notion
that
the
purpose
of
existence
was
not
solely
to
escape
awareness
of
peril
but
to
foresee
and
avoid
it
they
had
no
notion
of
purpose
as
yet
they
were
simply
outgrowing
purposelessness
after
a
time
they
even
looked
about
them
with
dim
stirrings
of
an
attitude
other
than
a
desperate
alertness
for
danger
humans
from
any
other
planet
surely
would
have
been
astounded
at
the
vistas
of
golden
mushrooms
stretching
out
in
forests
on
either
hand
and
the
plains
with
flaking
surfaces
given
every
imaginable
color
by
the
moulds
and
rusts
and
tiny
flowering
yeasts
growing
upon
them
they
would
have
been
amazed
by
the
turgid
pools
the
journeying
tribe
came
upon
where
the
water
was
concealed
by
a
thick
layer
of
slime
through
which
enormous
bubbles
of
gas
rose
to
enlarge
to
preposterous
size
before
bursting
abruptly
had
they
been
as
as
burl
folk
though
visitors
from
other
planets
would
have
been
at
least
as
timorous
lacking
highly
specialized
knowledge
of
the
ways
of
insects
on
this
world
even
visitors
would
have
been
in
greater
danger
but
the
tribe
went
on
without
a
single
casualty
they
had
fleeting
glimpses
of
the
white
spokes
of
symmetrical
whose
least
thread
no
member
of
the
tribe
could
break
their
immunity
from
disaster
though
in
the
midst
of
danger
gave
them
a
certain
concentration
upon
discomfort
lacking
calamities
they
noticed
their
discomforts
and
grew
weary
of
continual
traveling
a
few
of
the
men
complained
to
burl
for
answer
he
pointed
back
along
the
way
they
had
come
to
the
right
a
reddish
was
just
settling
and
to
the
rear
rose
another
as
they
looked
and
on
this
day
a
thing
happened
which
at
once
gave
the
complainers
the
rest
they
asked
for
and
proved
the
fatality
of
remaining
where
they
were
a
child
ran
aside
from
the
path
its
elders
were
following
the
ground
here
had
taken
on
a
brownish
hue
as
the
child
stirred
up
the
surface
mould
with
his
feet
dust
that
had
settled
was
raised
up
again
it
was
far
too
thin
to
have
any
visible
color
but
the
child
suddenly
screamed
strangling
the
mother
ran
frantically
to
snatch
him
up
the
red
dust
was
no
less
deadly
merely
because
it
had
settled
to
the
ground
if
a
came
now
but
they
were
infrequent
under
the
forgotten
planet
heavy
bank
of
clouds
the
fallen
red
dust
could
be
raised
up
again
and
scattered
about
until
there
would
be
no
living
thing
anywhere
which
would
not
gasp
and
writhe
and
die
but
the
child
would
not
die
he
would
suffer
terribly
and
be
weak
for
days
in
the
morning
he
could
be
carried
when
night
began
to
darken
the
sky
the
tribe
searched
for
a
they
came
upon
a
cliff
perhaps
twenty
or
thirty
feet
high
slanting
toward
the
line
of
the
tribesmen
travel
burl
saw
black
spots
in
it
openings
burrows
he
watched
them
as
the
tribe
drew
near
no
bees
or
wasps
went
in
or
out
he
watched
long
enough
to
be
sure
when
they
were
close
he
was
certain
ordering
the
others
to
wait
he
went
forward
to
make
doubly
sure
the
appearance
of
the
holes
reassured
him
dug
months
before
by
gone
or
dead
now
the
entrances
to
the
burrows
were
weathered
and
bedraggled
burl
explored
first
sniffing
carefully
at
each
opening
they
were
empty
this
would
be
shelter
for
the
night
he
called
his
followers
and
they
crawled
into
the
tunnels
to
hide
burl
stationed
himself
near
the
outer
edge
of
one
of
them
to
watch
for
signs
of
danger
night
had
not
quite
fallen
jon
and
dor
hungry
went
off
to
forage
a
little
way
beyond
the
cliff
they
would
be
cautious
and
timid
taking
no
risks
whatever
burl
waited
for
the
return
of
his
explorers
meanwhile
he
fretted
over
the
meaning
of
the
stricken
child
red
dust
was
dangerous
the
only
time
when
there
would
be
no
peril
from
it
would
be
at
night
when
the
dripping
rainfall
of
the
dark
hours
turned
the
surface
of
this
world
into
thin
shine
it
occurred
to
burl
that
it
would
be
safe
to
travel
at
night
so
far
as
the
red
dust
was
concerned
he
rejected
the
idea
instantly
it
was
unthinkable
to
travel
at
night
for
innumerable
other
reasons
frowning
he
poked
his
spear
idly
at
a
tumbled
mass
of
tiny
parchment
things
near
the
entrance
of
a
cave
and
instantly
movement
became
visible
fifty
sixty
a
hundred
infinitesimal
creatures
no
more
than
half
an
inch
in
length
made
haste
to
hide
themselves
among
the
paperlike
cups
they
moved
with
extraordinary
clumsiness
and
immense
effort
seemingly
only
by
contortions
of
their
bodies
burl
had
never
seen
any
creature
progress
in
such
a
slow
and
ineffective
fashion
he
drew
one
of
the
small
creatures
back
with
the
point
of
his
spear
and
examined
it
from
a
safe
distance
he
picked
it
up
on
his
spear
and
brought
it
close
to
his
eyes
the
thing
redoubled
its
frenzied
movements
it
slipped
off
the
spear
and
plopped
upon
the
soft
he
wore
about
his
middle
instantly
as
if
it
were
a
the
insect
vanished
burl
searched
for
minutes
before
he
found
it
hidden
deep
in
the
long
soft
hairs
of
his
garment
resting
motionless
and
seemingly
at
ease
it
was
the
larval
form
of
a
beetle
fragments
of
whose
armor
could
be
seen
near
the
base
of
the
clayey
cliffside
hidden
in
the
remnants
of
its
the
brood
of
minute
things
had
waited
near
the
opening
of
the
tunnel
it
was
their
gamble
with
destiny
when
grubs
had
slept
through
metamorphosis
and
come
uncertainly
out
of
the
tunnel
for
the
first
time
that
some
or
many
of
the
larvae
might
snatch
the
instant
chance
to
fasten
to
the
bees
legs
and
writhe
upward
to
an
anchorage
in
their
fur
it
happened
that
this
particular
batch
of
eggs
had
been
laid
after
the
emergence
of
the
grubs
they
had
no
possible
chance
of
fulfilling
their
intended
role
as
parasites
on
insects
of
the
order
hymenoptera
they
were
simply
and
doomed
by
the
blindness
of
instinct
which
had
caused
them
to
be
placed
where
they
could
not
possibly
survive
on
the
other
hand
if
one
or
many
of
them
had
found
a
the
offspring
of
their
host
would
have
been
doomed
the
place
filled
by
larvae
in
the
scheme
of
things
is
the
place
or
one
of
the
places
reserved
for
creatures
that
limit
the
number
of
when
a
has
made
a
new
tunnel
stocked
it
with
honey
for
its
young
and
then
laid
one
egg
to
float
on
that
pool
of
nourishment
and
hatch
and
feed
and
ultimately
grow
to
be
another
at
that
moment
of
one
small
detaches
itself
it
remains
zestfully
in
the
provisioned
cell
to
devour
the
egg
for
which
the
provisions
were
accumulated
it
happily
consumes
those
provisions
and
in
time
an
crawls
out
of
the
tunnel
a
so
laboriously
prepared
burl
had
no
difficulty
in
detaching
the
small
insect
and
casting
it
away
but
in
doing
so
he
discovered
that
others
had
hidden
themselves
in
his
fur
without
his
knowledge
he
plucked
them
away
and
found
more
while
savages
can
be
highly
tolerant
of
vermin
too
small
to
be
seen
they
feel
a
peculiar
revolt
against
serving
as
host
to
creatures
of
sensible
size
burl
reacted
violently
as
once
he
had
reacted
to
the
discovery
of
a
leech
clinging
to
his
heel
he
jerked
off
his
and
beat
it
savagely
with
his
spear
when
it
was
clean
he
still
felt
a
wholly
unreasonable
sense
of
humiliation
it
was
not
clearly
thought
out
of
course
burl
feared
huge
insects
too
much
to
hate
them
but
that
small
creatures
should
fasten
upon
him
produced
a
completely
irrational
feeling
of
outrage
for
the
first
time
in
very
many
years
or
centuries
a
human
being
upon
the
forgotten
planet
felt
that
he
had
been
insulted
his
dignity
had
been
assailed
burl
raged
but
as
he
raged
a
triumphant
shout
came
from
nearby
jon
and
dor
were
returning
from
their
foraging
loaded
down
with
edible
mushroom
they
also
had
taken
a
step
upward
toward
the
natural
dignity
of
men
they
had
so
far
forgotten
their
terror
as
to
shout
in
exultation
at
their
find
of
food
up
to
now
burl
had
been
the
only
man
daring
to
shout
now
there
were
two
others
in
his
overwrought
state
this
was
also
enraging
the
result
of
hurt
vanity
on
two
counts
was
jealousy
and
the
result
of
jealousy
was
a
crazy
foolhardiness
burl
ground
his
teeth
and
insanely
resolved
to
do
something
so
magnificent
so
tremendous
so
utterly
breathtaking
that
there
could
be
no
possible
imitation
by
anybody
else
his
thinking
was
not
especially
clear
part
of
his
motivation
had
been
provided
by
the
larvae
he
glared
about
him
at
the
deepening
dusk
seeking
some
exploit
some
glamorous
feat
to
perform
immediately
even
in
the
night
he
found
one
journey
through
it
was
late
dusk
and
the
reddened
clouds
overhead
were
deepening
steadily
toward
black
dark
shadows
hung
everywhere
the
clay
cliff
cut
off
all
vision
to
one
side
but
elsewhere
burl
could
see
outward
until
the
graying
haze
blotted
out
the
horizon
here
and
there
bees
droned
homeward
to
hive
or
burrow
sometimes
a
slender
graceful
wasp
passed
overhead
its
wings
invisible
by
the
swiftness
of
their
vibration
a
few
butterflies
lingered
hungrily
in
the
distance
seeking
the
few
things
they
could
still
feast
upon
no
moth
had
wakened
yet
to
the
night
the
grew
more
sombre
the
haze
seemed
to
close
in
and
shrink
the
world
that
burl
could
see
he
watched
raging
for
the
sight
that
would
provide
him
with
the
triumph
to
end
all
triumphs
among
his
followers
the
soft
fingers
of
the
night
touched
here
and
there
and
the
day
ended
at
those
spots
then
from
the
heart
of
the
deep
redness
to
the
west
a
flying
creature
came
it
was
a
beautiful
thing
a
yellow
emperor
butterfly
flapping
eastward
with
great
velvet
wings
that
seemed
black
against
the
sunset
burl
saw
it
sweep
across
the
incredible
sky
alight
delicately
and
disappear
behind
a
mass
of
toadstools
clustered
so
thickly
they
seemed
nearly
a
hillock
and
not
a
mass
of
growing
things
then
darkness
closed
in
completely
but
burl
still
stared
where
the
yellow
emperor
had
landed
there
was
that
temporary
utter
quiet
when
were
hidden
and
had
not
yet
ventured
out
glowed
patches
of
pale
phosphorescence
luminous
mushrooms
shone
faintly
in
the
dark
presently
burl
moved
through
the
night
he
could
imagine
the
yellow
emperor
in
its
delicately
preening
slender
limbs
before
it
settled
down
to
rest
until
the
new
day
dawned
he
had
noted
landmarks
to
guide
himself
a
week
earlier
and
his
blood
would
have
run
cold
at
the
bare
thought
of
doing
what
he
did
now
in
mere
detachment
he
would
have
known
that
what
he
did
was
close
to
madness
but
he
was
neither
nor
detached
he
crossed
the
clear
ground
before
the
low
cliff
but
for
the
beacons
he
would
have
been
lost
instantly
the
slow
drippings
of
rain
began
the
sky
was
dead
black
now
was
the
time
for
to
fly
and
male
tarantulas
to
go
seeking
mates
and
prey
it
was
definitely
no
time
for
adventuring
burl
moved
on
he
found
the
toadstools
by
the
process
of
running
into
them
in
the
total
obscurity
he
fumbled
trying
to
force
his
way
between
them
it
could
not
be
done
they
grew
too
close
and
too
low
he
raged
at
this
impediment
he
climbed
this
was
insanity
burl
stood
on
spongy
that
quivered
and
yielded
under
his
weight
somewhere
something
boomed
upward
rising
on
wings
into
blackness
he
heard
the
pulsing
drone
of
mosquitos
close
by
he
moved
forward
the
fungus
support
swaying
so
that
he
did
not
so
much
walk
as
stagger
over
the
mushroom
heads
he
groped
before
him
with
spear
and
panted
a
little
there
was
a
part
of
him
which
was
bitterly
afraid
but
he
raged
the
more
furiously
because
if
once
he
gave
way
even
to
caution
it
would
turn
to
panic
burl
would
have
made
a
strange
spectacle
in
daylight
gaudily
clothed
as
he
was
in
soft
blue
fur
and
velvet
cloak
staggering
over
swaying
insecurity
coddling
ferocity
in
himself
against
the
threat
of
fear
then
his
spear
told
him
there
was
emptiness
ahead
something
moved
below
he
heard
and
felt
it
stirring
the
on
which
he
stood
burl
raised
his
spear
grasping
it
in
both
hands
he
plunged
down
with
it
stabbing
fiercely
the
spear
struck
something
vastly
more
resistant
than
any
mushroom
could
be
it
penetrated
then
the
stabbed
thing
moved
as
burl
landed
upon
it
flinging
him
off
his
feet
but
he
clung
to
the
firmly
imbedded
weapon
and
if
his
mouth
had
opened
for
a
yell
of
victory
as
he
plunged
down
the
nature
of
the
surface
on
which
he
found
himself
and
the
kind
of
movement
he
felt
turned
that
yell
into
a
gasp
of
horror
it
was
the
furry
body
of
a
butterfly
he
had
landed
on
his
spear
had
pierced
such
a
creature
soft
flesh
he
had
leaped
upon
the
broad
hard
back
of
a
huge
nocturnal
beetle
his
spear
had
pierced
not
the
armor
but
the
leathery
between
head
and
thorax
the
giant
creature
rocketed
upward
with
burl
clinging
to
his
spear
he
held
fast
with
an
agonized
strength
his
mount
rose
from
the
blackness
of
the
ground
into
the
many
times
more
terrifying
blackness
of
the
air
it
rose
up
and
up
if
burl
could
have
screamed
he
would
have
done
so
but
he
could
not
cry
out
he
could
only
hold
fast
then
he
dropped
wind
roared
past
him
the
great
insect
was
clumsy
at
flying
all
beetles
are
burl
weight
and
the
pain
it
felt
made
its
flying
clumsier
still
there
was
a
crashing
and
an
impact
burl
was
torn
loose
and
hurled
away
he
crashed
into
the
spongy
top
of
a
mushroom
and
came
to
rest
with
his
naked
shoulder
hanging
halfway
over
some
invisible
drop
he
struggled
he
heard
the
whining
drone
of
his
attempted
prey
it
rocketed
aloft
again
but
there
was
something
wrong
with
it
with
his
weight
applied
to
the
spear
as
he
was
torn
free
burl
had
twisted
the
weapon
in
the
wound
it
had
driven
deeper
multiplying
the
damage
of
the
first
stab
the
beetle
crashed
to
earth
again
nearby
as
burl
struggled
again
the
split
and
let
him
gently
to
the
ground
he
heard
the
flounderings
of
the
great
beetle
in
the
darkness
it
mounted
skyward
once
more
its
no
longer
making
a
sustained
note
it
thrashed
the
air
irregularly
and
wildly
then
it
crashed
again
there
was
seeming
silence
save
for
the
steady
of
the
rain
and
burl
came
out
of
his
fear
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
slain
a
victim
even
more
magnificent
than
a
spider
because
this
creature
was
meat
he
found
himself
astonishedly
running
toward
the
spot
where
the
beetle
had
last
fallen
but
he
heard
it
struggle
aloft
once
more
it
was
wounded
to
death
burl
felt
certain
of
it
this
time
it
floundered
in
and
crashed
again
he
was
within
yards
of
it
before
he
checked
himself
now
he
was
weaponless
and
the
gigantic
insect
flung
itself
about
madly
on
the
ground
striking
out
with
colossal
wings
and
limbs
fighting
it
knew
not
what
it
struggled
to
fly
crashed
and
fought
its
way
off
the
ground
ever
more
weakly
then
smashed
again
into
mushrooms
there
it
floundered
horribly
in
the
darkness
burl
drew
near
and
waited
it
was
still
but
pain
again
drove
it
to
a
senseless
spasm
of
activity
then
it
struck
against
something
there
was
a
ripping
noise
and
instantly
the
close
peppery
burning
smell
of
the
red
dust
was
in
the
air
the
beetle
had
floundered
into
one
of
the
red
puffballs
tightly
filled
with
the
deadly
red
spores
the
red
dust
would
not
normally
have
been
released
at
night
with
the
nightly
rain
it
would
not
travel
so
far
or
spread
so
widely
burl
fled
panting
behind
him
he
heard
his
victim
rise
one
last
time
spurred
to
impossible
final
struggle
by
the
anguish
caused
by
the
red
dust
it
rose
clumsily
into
the
darkness
in
its
and
crashed
to
the
ground
again
for
the
last
time
in
time
to
come
burl
and
his
followers
might
learn
to
use
the
puffballs
as
weapons
but
not
how
to
spread
them
beyond
their
normal
range
but
now
burl
was
frightened
he
moved
hastily
sidewise
the
dust
would
travel
he
got
out
of
its
possible
path
there
could
be
no
exultation
where
the
red
dust
was
burl
suddenly
realized
what
had
happened
to
him
he
had
been
carried
aloft
an
unknown
though
distance
in
an
unknown
direction
he
was
separated
from
his
tribe
with
no
faintest
idea
how
to
find
them
in
the
darkness
and
it
was
night
he
crouched
under
the
nearest
huge
toadstool
and
waited
for
the
dawn
listening
for
the
sound
of
death
coming
toward
him
through
the
night
but
only
the
of
came
to
his
ears
and
the
discordant
notes
of
as
they
roamed
the
mushroom
thickets
seeking
the
places
beneath
which
so
their
adapted
instincts
told
them
fungoid
dainties
not
too
much
unlike
the
truffles
of
earth
awaited
the
industrious
miner
and
of
course
there
was
that
eternal
monotonous
dripping
of
the
raindrops
falling
at
irregular
intervals
from
the
sky
red
puffballs
did
not
burst
at
night
they
would
not
burst
anyhow
except
at
one
certain
season
of
their
growth
but
burl
and
his
folk
had
so
far
encountered
the
ones
bursting
earlier
than
most
the
time
of
ripeness
was
very
nearly
here
though
when
day
came
again
and
the
chill
dampness
of
the
night
was
succeeded
by
the
warmth
of
the
morning
almost
the
first
thing
burl
saw
in
the
gray
light
was
a
tall
spouting
of
stuff
leaping
abruptly
into
the
air
from
a
burst
red
sphere
he
stood
up
and
looked
anxiously
all
around
here
and
there
all
over
the
landscape
slowly
and
at
intervals
the
plumes
of
fatal
red
sprang
into
the
air
there
was
nothing
quite
like
it
anywhere
else
an
ancient
man
inhabiting
earth
might
have
likened
the
appearance
to
that
of
a
scattered
and
leisurely
bombardment
but
burl
had
no
analogy
for
them
he
saw
something
hardly
a
hundred
yards
from
where
he
had
hidden
during
the
night
the
dead
beetle
lay
there
crumpled
and
limp
burl
eyed
it
speculatively
then
he
saw
something
that
filled
him
with
elation
the
last
crash
of
the
beetle
to
the
ground
had
driven
his
spear
deeply
between
the
joints
of
the
corselet
and
neck
even
if
the
red
dust
had
not
finished
the
creature
the
would
have
ended
its
life
he
was
thrilled
once
more
by
his
superlative
greatness
he
made
due
note
that
he
was
a
mighty
slayer
he
took
the
antennae
as
proof
of
his
valor
and
hacked
off
a
great
leg
for
meat
and
then
he
remembered
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
find
his
he
had
no
idea
which
way
to
go
even
a
civilized
man
would
have
been
at
a
loss
though
he
would
have
hunted
for
an
elevation
from
which
to
look
for
the
cliff
of
the
tribe
but
burl
had
not
yet
progressed
so
far
his
wild
ride
of
the
night
before
had
been
at
random
and
the
chase
after
the
wounded
beetle
no
less
dictated
by
chance
there
was
no
answer
he
set
off
anxiously
searching
everywhere
but
he
had
to
be
alert
for
all
the
dangers
of
an
inimical
world
while
keeping
at
the
same
time
an
extremely
sharp
eye
out
for
bursting
red
puffballs
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
thought
he
saw
familiar
things
then
he
recognized
the
spot
he
had
come
back
to
the
dead
beetle
it
was
already
the
center
of
a
mass
of
small
black
bodies
which
pulled
and
hacked
at
the
tough
armor
gnawing
out
great
lumps
of
flesh
to
be
carried
to
the
nearest
burl
set
off
again
very
carefully
avoiding
any
place
that
he
recognized
as
having
been
seen
that
morning
sometimes
he
walked
through
dangerous
places
to
be
in
and
sometimes
over
relatively
clear
ground
colored
exotically
with
varicolored
fungi
more
than
once
he
saw
the
clouds
of
red
stuff
spurting
in
the
distance
deep
anxiety
filled
him
he
had
no
idea
that
there
were
such
things
as
points
of
the
compass
he
knew
only
that
he
needed
desperately
to
find
his
tribesfolk
again
they
of
course
had
given
him
up
for
dead
he
had
vanished
in
the
night
old
tama
complained
of
him
shrilly
the
night
to
them
meant
death
jon
quaked
watchfully
all
through
it
when
burl
did
not
come
to
the
feast
of
mushroom
that
jon
and
dor
had
brought
back
they
sought
him
they
even
called
timidly
into
the
darkness
they
heard
the
throbbing
of
huge
wings
as
a
great
creature
rose
desperately
into
the
sky
but
they
did
not
associate
that
sound
with
burl
if
they
had
they
would
have
been
instantly
certain
of
his
fate
as
it
was
the
tribe
uneasiness
grew
into
terror
which
rapidly
turned
to
despair
they
began
to
tremble
wondering
what
they
would
do
with
no
bold
chieftain
to
guide
them
he
was
the
first
man
to
command
allegiance
from
others
in
much
too
long
a
period
on
the
forgotten
planet
but
the
submission
of
his
followers
had
been
the
more
complete
for
its
novelty
his
loss
was
the
more
appalling
burl
had
mistaken
the
triumphant
shout
of
the
foragers
he
thought
it
independence
of
him
rivalry
actually
the
men
dared
to
shout
only
because
they
felt
secure
under
his
leadership
when
they
accepted
the
fact
that
he
had
vanished
and
to
disappear
in
the
night
had
always
meant
death
their
old
fears
and
timidity
returned
to
them
it
was
added
despair
they
huddled
together
and
whispered
to
one
another
of
their
fright
they
waited
in
trembling
silence
through
all
the
long
night
had
a
appeared
they
would
have
fled
in
as
many
directions
as
there
were
people
and
undoubtedly
all
would
have
perished
but
day
came
again
and
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
and
saw
the
fear
saya
was
probably
the
most
pitiful
of
the
group
her
face
was
white
and
drawn
beyond
that
of
any
one
else
they
did
not
move
when
day
brightened
they
remained
about
the
speaking
in
hushed
tones
huddled
together
searching
all
the
horizon
for
enemies
saya
would
not
eat
but
sat
still
staring
before
her
in
numbed
grief
burl
was
dead
atop
the
low
cliff
a
red
puffball
glistened
in
the
morning
light
its
tough
skin
was
taut
and
bulging
resisting
the
pressure
of
the
spores
within
slowly
as
the
morning
wore
on
some
of
the
moisture
that
kept
the
skin
stretchable
dried
the
stuff
contracted
the
tautness
of
the
envelope
grew
greater
it
became
insupportable
with
a
ripping
sound
the
tough
skin
split
across
and
a
rush
of
the
compressed
spores
shot
skyward
the
tribesmen
saw
and
cried
out
and
fled
the
red
stuff
drifted
down
past
the
it
drifted
toward
the
humans
they
ran
from
it
jon
and
tama
ran
fastest
jak
and
cori
and
the
other
were
not
far
behind
saya
trailed
in
her
despair
had
burl
been
there
matters
would
have
been
different
he
had
already
such
an
ascendancy
over
the
minds
of
the
others
that
even
in
panic
they
would
have
looked
to
see
what
he
did
and
he
would
have
dodged
the
slowly
drifting
by
day
as
he
had
during
the
night
but
his
followers
ran
blindly
as
saya
fled
after
the
others
she
heard
shrieks
of
fright
to
the
left
and
ran
faster
she
passed
by
a
thick
mass
of
distorted
fungi
in
which
there
was
a
sudden
stirring
and
panic
lent
wings
to
her
feet
she
fled
blindly
panting
ahead
was
a
great
mass
of
stuff
red
puffballs
showing
here
and
there
among
great
fanlike
growths
some
twelve
feet
high
that
looked
like
sponges
she
fled
past
them
and
swerved
to
hide
herself
from
anything
that
might
be
pursuing
by
sight
her
foot
slipped
on
the
slimy
body
of
a
snail
and
she
fell
heavily
her
head
striking
a
stone
she
lay
still
almost
as
if
at
a
signal
a
red
puffball
burst
among
the
fanlike
growths
a
thick
cloud
of
dust
shot
upward
spread
and
billowed
and
began
to
settle
slowly
toward
the
ground
again
it
moved
as
it
settled
flowing
over
the
inequalities
of
die
ground
as
a
monstrous
snail
or
leach
might
have
done
sucking
from
all
breathing
creatures
the
life
they
had
within
them
it
was
a
hundred
yards
away
then
fifty
then
thirty
had
any
member
of
the
tribe
watched
it
the
red
dust
might
have
seemed
malevolently
intelligent
but
when
the
edges
of
the
were
no
more
than
twenty
yards
from
saya
limp
body
an
opposing
breeze
sprang
up
it
was
a
vagrant
fitful
little
breeze
that
halted
the
red
cloud
and
threw
it
into
some
confusion
sending
it
in
a
new
direction
it
passed
saya
without
hurting
her
though
one
of
its
misty
tendrils
reached
out
as
if
to
snatch
at
her
in
but
it
passed
her
by
saya
lay
motionless
on
the
ground
only
her
breast
rose
and
fell
shallowly
a
tiny
pool
of
red
gathered
near
her
head
some
thirty
feet
from
where
she
lay
there
were
three
miniature
toadstools
in
a
clump
bases
so
close
together
that
they
seemed
but
one
from
between
two
of
them
however
two
tufts
of
reddish
thread
appeared
they
twinkled
back
and
forth
and
in
and
out
as
if
reassured
two
slender
antennae
followed
then
bulging
eyes
and
a
small
black
body
with
scalloped
markings
upon
it
it
was
a
tiny
beetle
no
more
than
eight
inches
long
a
sexton
or
drawing
near
saya
body
it
scurried
onto
her
flesh
it
went
from
end
to
end
of
her
figure
in
a
sort
of
feverish
haste
then
it
dived
into
the
ground
beneath
her
shoulder
casting
back
a
little
shower
of
dirt
as
it
disappeared
ten
minutes
later
another
small
creature
appeared
precisely
like
the
first
upon
the
heels
of
the
second
came
a
third
each
made
the
same
hasty
examination
and
dived
under
her
unmoving
form
presently
the
ground
seemed
to
billow
at
a
spot
along
saya
side
and
then
at
another
ten
minutes
after
the
arrival
of
the
third
beetle
a
little
rampart
had
reared
itself
all
about
saya
body
following
her
outlines
precisely
then
her
body
moved
slightly
in
little
jerks
seeming
to
settle
perhaps
half
an
inch
into
the
ground
the
were
of
that
class
of
creatures
which
exploited
the
bodies
of
the
fallen
working
from
below
they
excavated
the
earth
when
there
was
a
hollow
space
below
they
turned
on
their
backs
and
thrust
up
with
their
legs
jerking
at
the
body
until
it
sank
into
the
space
they
had
made
ready
the
process
would
be
repeated
until
at
last
all
their
dead
treasures
had
settled
down
below
the
level
of
the
surrounding
ground
the
loosened
dirt
then
fell
in
at
the
sides
completing
the
inhumation
then
in
the
underground
darkness
it
was
the
custom
for
the
beetles
to
feast
magnificently
gorging
themselves
upon
the
food
they
had
hidden
from
other
scavengers
and
of
course
rearing
their
young
also
upon
its
substance
ants
and
flies
were
rivals
of
these
beetles
and
not
infrequently
the
came
upon
carrion
after
ants
had
taken
their
toll
and
when
it
already
swarmed
with
maggots
but
in
this
case
saya
was
not
dead
the
fact
that
she
still
lived
though
unconscious
was
the
factor
that
had
given
the
this
splendid
opportunity
she
breathed
gently
and
irregularly
her
face
drawn
with
the
sorrow
of
the
night
before
while
the
desperately
hurrying
beetles
swarmed
about
beneath
her
body
channelling
away
the
soil
so
she
would
sink
lower
and
lower
into
it
she
descended
slowly
a
by
a
the
tufts
of
thread
appeared
again
and
a
beetle
made
its
way
to
the
open
air
it
moved
hastily
about
inspecting
the
progress
of
the
work
it
dived
below
again
another
inch
and
after
a
long
time
another
were
excavated
matters
still
progressed
when
burl
stepped
out
from
a
group
of
overshadowing
toadstools
and
halted
he
cast
his
eyes
over
the
landscape
and
was
struck
by
its
familiarity
he
was
in
fact
very
near
the
spot
he
had
left
the
night
before
in
that
maniacal
ride
on
the
back
of
a
flying
beetle
he
moved
back
and
forth
trying
to
account
for
the
feeling
of
recognition
he
saw
the
low
cliff
then
and
moved
eagerly
toward
it
passing
within
fifty
feet
of
saya
body
now
more
than
in
the
ground
the
loose
dirt
around
the
outline
of
her
figure
was
beginning
to
topple
in
little
rivulets
upon
her
one
of
her
shoulders
was
already
from
view
burl
passed
on
unseeing
he
hurried
a
little
in
a
moment
he
recognized
his
location
exactly
there
were
the
burrows
there
was
a
lump
of
edible
mushroom
cast
aside
as
the
tribesfolk
fled
his
feet
stirred
up
a
fine
dust
and
he
stopped
short
a
red
puffball
had
burst
here
it
fully
accounted
for
the
absence
of
the
tribe
and
burl
sweated
in
sudden
fear
he
thought
instantly
of
saya
he
went
carefully
to
make
sure
this
was
absolutely
the
hiding
place
of
the
tribe
there
was
another
there
was
a
spear
thrown
down
by
one
of
the
men
in
his
flight
red
dust
had
settled
upon
the
spear
and
the
burl
turned
back
hurrying
again
but
taking
care
to
disturb
the
dust
no
more
than
he
could
possibly
help
the
little
excavation
into
which
saya
was
sinking
inch
by
inch
was
not
in
his
path
her
body
no
longer
lay
above
the
ground
but
in
it
burl
went
by
frantic
with
anxiety
about
the
tribe
but
about
saya
most
of
all
her
body
quivered
and
sank
a
fraction
into
the
ground
half
a
dozen
small
streams
of
earth
were
tumbling
upon
her
in
minutes
she
would
be
wholly
hidden
from
view
burl
went
to
beat
among
the
in
quest
of
the
bodies
of
his
tribesfolk
they
could
have
staggered
out
of
the
red
dust
and
collapsed
beyond
he
would
have
shouted
but
the
deep
sense
of
loneliness
silenced
him
his
throat
ached
with
grief
he
searched
on
there
was
a
noise
from
a
huge
clump
of
toadstools
perhaps
the
very
one
he
had
climbed
over
in
the
night
there
came
the
sound
of
crashings
and
the
breaking
of
the
spongy
stuff
twin
tapering
antennae
appeared
and
then
a
monster
beetle
lurched
into
the
open
space
its
ghastly
mandibles
gaping
sidewise
it
was
all
of
eight
feet
long
and
supported
by
six
crooked
legs
huge
multiple
eyes
stared
with
preoccupation
at
the
world
it
advanced
deliberately
with
clankings
and
clashings
as
of
a
hideous
machine
burl
fled
on
the
instant
running
directly
away
from
it
a
little
depression
lay
in
the
ground
before
him
he
did
not
swerve
but
made
to
jump
over
it
as
he
leaped
he
saw
the
color
of
bare
flesh
saya
limp
and
helpless
sinking
slowly
into
the
ground
with
tricklings
of
dirt
falling
down
to
cover
her
it
seemed
to
burl
that
she
quivered
a
little
instantly
there
was
a
terrific
struggle
within
burl
behind
him
was
the
giant
beetle
beneath
him
was
saya
whom
he
loved
there
was
certain
death
lurching
toward
him
on
evilly
crooked
legs
and
the
life
he
had
hoped
for
lay
in
a
shallow
pit
of
course
he
thought
saya
dead
perhaps
it
was
rage
or
despair
or
a
simple
human
madness
which
made
him
act
otherwise
than
rationally
the
things
which
raise
humans
above
brute
creation
however
are
only
partly
reasonable
most
human
emotions
especially
the
creditable
ones
can
not
be
justified
by
reason
and
very
few
heroic
actions
are
based
upon
logical
thought
burl
whirled
as
he
landed
his
puny
spear
held
ready
in
his
left
hand
he
held
the
haunch
of
a
creature
much
like
the
one
which
clanked
and
rattled
toward
him
with
a
yell
of
insane
defiance
completely
beyond
justification
by
reason
burl
flung
that
leg
at
the
monster
it
hit
undoubtedly
it
hurt
the
beetle
seized
it
ferociously
it
crushed
it
there
was
meat
in
it
sweet
and
juicy
the
beetle
devoured
it
it
forgot
the
man
standing
there
waiting
for
death
it
crunched
the
of
a
cousin
or
brother
confusing
the
blow
with
the
missile
that
had
delivered
it
when
the
tidbit
was
finished
it
turned
and
lumbered
off
to
investigate
another
mushroom
thicket
it
seemed
to
consider
then
an
enemy
had
been
conquered
and
devoured
and
that
normal
life
could
go
on
then
burl
stopped
quickly
and
dragged
saya
from
the
grave
the
had
labored
so
feverishly
to
provide
for
her
crumbled
soil
fell
from
her
shoulders
from
her
face
and
from
her
body
three
little
beetles
with
black
and
red
markings
scurried
for
cover
in
terrified
haste
burl
carried
saya
to
a
of
soft
mould
to
mourn
over
her
he
was
a
completely
ignorant
savage
save
that
he
knew
more
of
the
ways
of
insects
than
anybody
anywhere
else
the
ecological
service
which
had
stocked
this
planet
not
being
excepted
to
burl
the
unconsciousness
of
saya
was
as
death
itself
dumb
misery
smote
him
and
he
laid
her
down
gently
and
quite
literally
wept
he
had
been
beautifully
pleased
with
himself
for
having
slain
one
flying
beetle
but
for
saya
seeming
death
he
would
have
been
almost
unbearable
with
pride
over
having
put
another
to
flight
but
now
he
was
merely
a
very
human
young
man
but
a
long
time
later
saya
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
about
bewilderedly
they
were
in
considerable
danger
for
some
time
after
that
because
they
were
oblivious
to
everything
but
each
other
saya
rested
in
happiness
against
burl
shoulder
as
he
told
her
jerkily
of
his
attempt
on
a
butterfly
which
turned
out
to
be
a
flying
beetle
that
took
him
aloft
he
told
of
his
search
for
the
tribe
and
then
his
discovery
of
her
apparently
lifeless
body
when
he
spoke
of
the
monster
which
had
lurched
from
the
mushroom
thicket
and
of
the
desperation
with
which
he
had
faced
it
saya
looked
at
him
with
warm
proud
eyes
but
burl
was
abruptly
struck
with
the
remarkable
convenience
of
that
discovery
if
his
tribesmen
could
secure
an
ample
supply
of
meat
they
might
defend
themselves
against
attack
by
throwing
it
to
their
attackers
in
fact
insects
were
so
stupid
that
almost
any
object
thrown
quickly
enough
and
fast
enough
might
be
made
to
serve
as
sacrifices
instead
of
themselves
a
timid
frightened
whisper
roused
them
from
their
absorption
they
looked
up
the
boy
dik
stood
some
distance
away
staring
at
them
almost
convinced
that
he
looked
upon
the
living
dead
a
sudden
movement
on
the
part
of
either
of
them
would
have
sent
him
bolting
away
two
or
three
other
bobbing
heads
gazed
affrightedly
from
nearby
jon
was
poised
for
flight
the
tribe
had
come
back
to
its
former
simply
as
a
way
to
reassemble
they
had
believed
both
burl
and
saya
dead
and
they
accepted
burl
death
as
their
own
doom
but
now
they
stared
burl
spoke
fortunately
without
arrogance
and
dik
and
tet
came
timorously
from
their
the
others
followed
the
tribe
forming
a
frightened
about
the
seated
pair
burl
spoke
again
and
presently
one
of
the
bravest
cori
dared
to
approach
and
touch
him
instantly
a
babble
of
the
crude
labial
language
of
the
tribe
broke
out
awed
exclamations
and
questions
filled
the
air
but
burl
for
once
showed
some
common
sense
instead
of
a
vainglorious
recital
he
merely
cast
down
the
long
tapering
antennae
of
the
they
looked
and
recognized
their
origin
then
burl
curtly
ordered
dor
and
jak
to
make
a
chair
of
their
hands
for
saya
she
was
weak
from
her
fall
and
the
loss
of
blood
the
two
men
humbly
advanced
and
obeyed
then
burl
curtly
ordered
the
march
resumed
they
went
on
more
slowly
than
on
previous
days
but
steadily
burl
led
them
marching
in
advance
with
a
alertness
for
signs
of
danger
he
felt
more
confidence
than
ever
before
it
was
not
fully
justified
of
course
jon
now
retrieved
the
spear
he
had
discarded
the
small
party
fairly
bristled
with
weapons
but
burl
knew
that
they
were
liable
to
be
cast
away
as
impediments
if
flight
seemed
necessary
as
he
led
the
way
burl
began
to
think
busily
in
the
manner
that
only
leaders
find
necessary
he
had
taught
his
followers
to
kill
ants
for
food
though
they
were
still
uneasy
about
such
adventures
he
had
led
them
to
attack
great
yellow
grubs
upon
giant
cabbages
but
they
had
not
yet
faced
any
actual
danger
as
he
had
done
he
must
drive
them
to
face
something
the
opportunity
came
that
same
day
in
late
afternoon
to
westward
the
was
barely
beginning
to
show
the
colors
that
presage
nightfall
when
a
droned
heavily
overhead
making
for
its
home
burrow
the
little
straggling
group
of
marching
people
looked
up
and
saw
the
scanty
load
of
pollen
packed
in
the
stiff
bristles
of
the
bee
it
sped
onward
heavily
its
almost
transparent
wings
mere
blurs
in
the
air
it
was
barely
fifty
feet
above
the
ground
burl
dropped
his
glance
and
tensed
a
wasp
was
shooting
upward
from
an
ambush
among
the
noisome
fungi
of
this
plain
the
bee
swerved
and
tried
to
escape
the
wasp
it
the
bee
dodged
frantically
it
was
a
good
four
feet
in
length
as
large
as
the
wasp
certainly
but
it
was
more
heavily
built
and
could
not
make
the
speed
of
which
the
wasp
was
capable
it
dodged
with
less
agility
twice
in
desperation
it
did
manage
to
evade
the
plunging
dives
of
the
wasp
but
the
third
time
the
two
insects
grappled
in
almost
over
the
heads
of
the
humans
they
tumbled
downward
in
a
clawing
biting
tangle
of
bodies
and
legs
they
hit
the
ground
and
rolled
over
and
over
the
bee
struggled
to
insert
her
barbed
sting
in
the
more
supple
body
of
her
adversary
she
writhed
and
twisted
desperately
but
there
came
an
instant
of
infinite
confusion
and
the
bee
lay
on
her
back
the
wasp
suddenly
moved
with
that
ghastly
skilled
precision
of
a
creature
performing
an
incredible
feat
instinctively
apparently
unaware
that
it
is
doing
so
the
dazed
bee
was
swung
upright
in
a
peculiarly
artificial
pose
the
wasp
body
curved
and
its
deadly
sting
struck
the
bee
was
dead
instantly
as
if
struck
dead
by
lightning
the
wasp
had
stung
in
a
certain
place
in
the
where
all
the
pass
to
sting
there
the
wasp
had
to
bring
its
victim
to
a
particular
pose
it
was
precisely
the
trick
of
a
the
butcher
who
kills
cattle
by
severing
the
spinal
cord
for
the
wasp
purposes
the
bee
had
to
be
killed
in
this
fashion
and
no
other
burl
began
to
give
commands
to
his
followers
he
knew
what
was
coming
next
and
so
did
they
when
the
sequel
of
the
murder
began
he
moved
forward
his
tribesmen
wavering
after
him
this
venture
was
actually
one
of
the
least
dangerous
they
could
attempt
but
merely
to
attack
a
wasp
was
a
idea
only
burl
prestige
plus
their
knowledge
made
them
capable
of
it
the
second
act
of
the
was
gruesomeness
itself
the
was
a
carnivore
but
this
was
the
season
when
the
wasps
raised
young
inevitably
there
was
sweet
honey
in
the
crop
of
the
bee
had
she
arrived
safely
at
the
hive
the
sweet
and
sticky
liquid
would
have
been
disgorged
for
the
benefit
of
the
wasp
avidly
set
to
work
to
secure
that
honey
the
itself
was
destined
for
the
own
offspring
and
that
squirming
monstrosity
is
even
more
violently
carnivorous
than
its
mother
the
parent
wasp
set
about
abstracting
the
dead
bee
honey
before
taking
the
carcass
to
its
young
one
because
honey
is
poisonous
to
the
grub
yet
insects
can
not
act
from
solicitude
or
anything
but
instinct
and
instinct
must
be
maintained
by
lavish
rewards
so
the
sought
its
reward
an
insane
insatiable
gluttonous
satisfaction
in
the
honey
that
was
poison
to
its
young
the
wasp
foiled
its
murdered
victim
upon
its
back
again
and
feverishly
pressed
on
the
limp
body
to
force
out
the
honey
and
this
was
the
reason
for
its
precise
manner
of
murder
only
when
killed
by
the
destruction
of
all
would
the
bee
body
be
left
limp
like
this
only
a
bee
killed
in
this
exact
fashion
would
yield
its
honey
to
manipulation
the
honey
appeared
flowing
from
the
dead
bee
mouth
the
wasp
in
trembling
ghoulish
ecstasy
devoured
it
as
it
appeared
it
was
lost
to
all
other
sights
or
sensations
but
its
feast
and
this
was
the
moment
when
burl
signalled
for
the
attack
the
tribesmen
prey
was
deaf
and
blind
and
raptured
it
was
aware
of
nothing
but
the
delight
it
savored
but
the
men
wavered
nevertheless
when
they
drew
near
burl
was
first
to
thrust
his
spear
powerfully
into
the
trembling
body
when
he
was
not
instantly
destroyed
the
others
took
courage
dor
spear
penetrated
the
very
vitals
of
the
ghoul
jak
club
fell
with
terrific
force
upon
the
wasp
slender
waist
there
was
a
crackling
and
the
long
spidery
limbs
quivered
and
writhed
then
burl
struck
again
and
the
creature
fell
into
two
writhing
halves
they
butchered
it
rather
messily
but
burl
noticed
that
even
as
it
died
sundered
and
pierced
with
spears
its
long
tongue
licked
out
in
one
last
rapturous
taste
of
the
honey
that
had
been
its
undoing
some
time
later
burdened
with
the
pollen
laden
legs
of
the
great
bee
the
tribe
resumed
its
journey
now
burl
had
men
behind
him
they
were
still
timid
and
prone
to
flee
at
the
least
alarm
but
they
were
vastly
more
dependable
than
they
had
been
they
had
attacked
and
slain
a
wasp
whose
sting
would
have
killed
any
of
them
they
had
done
battle
under
the
leadership
of
burl
whose
spear
had
struck
the
first
blow
they
were
sharers
of
his
glory
and
therefore
much
more
nearly
like
the
followers
of
a
chieftain
ought
to
be
their
new
spirit
was
badly
needed
the
red
puffballs
were
certainly
no
less
numerous
in
the
new
territory
the
tribe
traversed
than
in
the
territory
they
had
left
and
the
season
of
their
ripening
was
further
advanced
more
and
more
of
the
ground
showed
the
deadly
rime
of
settled
to
stay
alive
was
increasingly
difficult
when
the
full
season
arrived
it
would
be
impossible
and
that
season
could
not
be
far
away
the
very
next
day
after
the
killing
of
the
wasp
survival
despite
the
red
dust
had
begun
to
seem
unimaginable
where
earlier
one
saw
a
cloud
bursting
here
and
there
at
intervals
on
this
day
there
was
always
a
billowing
mass
of
lethal
vapor
in
the
air
at
no
time
was
the
landscape
free
of
a
moving
mist
of
death
usually
there
were
three
or
four
in
sight
at
once
often
there
were
half
a
dozen
once
there
were
eight
it
could
be
guessed
that
in
one
day
more
they
would
ripen
in
such
monstrous
numbers
that
anything
which
walked
or
flew
or
crawled
must
breathe
in
the
spores
and
perish
and
that
day
just
at
sunset
the
tribe
came
to
the
top
of
a
small
rise
in
the
ground
for
an
hour
they
had
been
marching
and
countermarching
to
avoid
the
clouds
of
dust
once
they
had
been
nearly
hemmed
in
when
three
of
the
mists
seemed
to
flow
together
enclosing
the
three
sides
of
a
circle
they
escaped
then
only
by
the
most
desperate
of
sprinting
but
now
they
came
to
the
little
hillock
and
halted
before
them
stretched
a
plain
all
of
four
miles
wide
colored
a
brownish
by
the
red
puffballs
the
tribe
had
seen
mushroom
forests
they
had
lived
in
them
and
knew
of
the
dangers
that
lurked
there
but
the
plain
before
them
was
not
simply
dangerous
it
was
fatal
to
right
and
left
it
stretched
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
but
away
on
its
farther
edge
burl
caught
a
glimpse
of
flowing
water
over
the
plain
itself
a
thin
red
haze
seemed
to
float
it
was
simply
a
cloud
of
the
deadly
spores
dispersed
and
indefinite
but
constantly
replenished
by
the
freshly
bursting
puffballs
while
the
tribesfolk
stood
and
watched
thick
columns
of
dust
rose
here
and
there
and
at
the
other
place
too
many
to
count
they
settled
again
but
left
behind
enough
of
the
fine
powder
to
keep
a
thin
red
haze
over
all
the
plain
this
was
a
mass
of
literally
millions
of
the
deadly
growths
here
was
one
place
where
no
carnivorous
beetles
roamed
and
where
no
spiders
lurked
there
were
nothing
here
but
the
sullen
columns
of
dust
and
the
haze
that
they
left
behind
and
of
course
it
would
be
nothing
less
than
suicide
to
try
to
go
back
a
flight
burl
kept
his
people
alive
until
darkness
fell
he
had
assigned
watchers
for
each
direction
and
when
flight
was
necessary
the
adults
helped
the
children
to
avoid
the
red
dust
four
times
they
changed
direction
after
warnings
when
night
settled
over
the
plain
they
were
forced
to
come
to
a
halt
but
the
puffballs
were
designed
to
burst
by
day
stumbled
into
they
could
split
at
any
time
and
the
humans
did
hear
some
few
of
the
tearing
noises
that
denoted
a
in
the
darkness
but
after
slow
nightly
rain
began
they
heard
no
more
burl
led
his
people
into
the
plain
of
red
puffballs
as
soon
as
the
rain
had
lasted
long
enough
to
wash
down
the
red
haze
still
hanging
in
the
air
and
turn
the
fallen
spores
to
mud
it
was
an
enterprise
of
such
absolute
desperation
that
very
likely
no
civilized
man
would
have
tried
it
there
were
no
stars
for
guidance
nor
compasses
to
show
the
way
there
were
no
lights
to
enable
them
to
dodge
the
deadly
things
they
strove
to
escape
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
their
keeping
a
straight
course
in
the
darkness
they
had
to
trust
to
luck
in
perhaps
the
longest
that
humans
every
accepted
as
a
gamble
quaintly
they
used
the
long
antennae
of
a
dead
as
for
themselves
they
entered
the
red
plain
in
a
long
single
file
burl
leading
the
way
with
one
of
the
two
feathery
whips
extended
before
him
saya
helped
him
check
on
what
lay
in
the
darkness
ahead
but
made
sure
not
to
leave
his
side
others
trailed
behind
hand
in
hand
progress
was
slow
the
sky
was
utter
blackness
of
course
but
nowhere
in
the
lowlands
is
there
an
absolute
black
where
does
burn
without
consuming
there
are
mushrooms
with
glows
of
their
own
rusts
sometimes
shone
faintly
naturally
there
were
no
fireflies
or
of
any
sort
but
neither
were
there
any
living
things
to
hunt
the
tiny
tribe
as
it
moved
in
single
file
through
the
plain
of
red
puffballs
within
half
an
hour
even
burl
did
not
believe
he
had
kept
to
his
original
line
an
hour
later
they
realized
despairingly
that
they
were
marching
helpless
through
puffballs
which
would
make
the
air
unbreathable
at
dawn
but
they
marched
on
once
they
smelled
the
rank
odor
of
cabbages
they
followed
the
scent
and
came
upon
them
glowing
palely
with
parasitic
moulds
on
their
leaves
and
there
were
living
things
here
huge
caterpillars
eating
and
eating
even
in
the
dark
against
the
time
of
metamorphosis
burl
could
have
cried
out
infuriatedly
at
them
because
they
were
so
he
assumed
immune
to
the
death
of
the
red
dust
but
the
red
dust
was
all
about
and
the
smell
of
cabbages
was
not
the
smell
of
life
it
could
have
been
of
course
caterpillars
breathe
like
all
insects
at
every
stage
of
their
development
but
furry
caterpillars
breathe
through
openings
which
are
covered
over
with
matted
fur
here
that
matted
fur
acted
to
filter
the
air
the
eggs
of
the
caterpillars
had
been
laid
before
the
puffballs
were
ready
to
burst
the
time
of
would
be
over
before
the
grubs
were
butterflies
or
moths
these
creatures
were
safe
against
all
enemies
even
men
but
men
groped
and
blundered
in
the
darkness
simply
because
they
did
not
think
to
take
the
fur
garments
they
wore
and
hold
them
to
their
noses
to
serve
as
or
the
time
for
that
would
come
but
not
yet
with
the
docility
of
despair
burl
tribe
followed
him
through
all
the
night
when
the
sky
began
to
pale
in
the
east
they
numbly
resigned
themselves
to
death
but
still
they
followed
and
in
the
very
early
gray
light
when
only
the
very
ripest
of
the
red
puffballs
spouted
toward
a
sky
burl
looked
harassedly
about
him
and
could
have
groaned
he
was
in
a
little
circular
clearing
the
deadly
red
things
all
about
him
there
was
not
yet
light
enough
for
colors
to
appear
there
was
merely
a
vast
stillness
everywhere
and
a
mocking
hint
of
the
hot
and
peppery
scent
of
now
turned
to
mud
all
about
him
burl
dropped
in
bitter
discouragement
soon
the
misty
would
begin
to
move
about
the
reddish
haze
would
form
above
all
this
space
then
quite
suddenly
he
lifted
his
head
and
whooped
he
had
heard
the
sound
of
running
water
his
followers
looked
at
him
with
dawning
hope
without
a
word
to
them
burl
began
to
run
they
followed
hastily
and
quickened
their
pace
when
his
voice
came
back
in
a
shout
of
triumph
in
a
moment
they
had
emerged
from
the
tangle
of
fungus
growths
to
stand
upon
the
banks
of
a
wide
river
the
same
river
whose
gleam
burl
had
seen
the
day
before
from
the
farther
side
of
the
red
puffball
plain
once
before
burl
had
floated
down
a
river
upon
a
mushroom
raft
that
journey
had
been
involuntary
he
had
been
carried
far
from
his
tribe
and
saya
his
heart
filled
with
desolation
but
now
he
viewed
the
current
with
delight
he
cast
his
eyes
up
and
down
the
bank
here
and
there
it
rose
in
a
low
bluff
and
thick
stretched
out
above
the
water
they
were
adaptations
of
the
fungi
that
once
had
grown
on
trees
and
now
fed
upon
the
incredibly
nourishing
formed
of
dead
growing
things
burl
was
busy
in
an
instant
stabbing
the
relatively
hard
growths
with
his
spear
and
striving
to
wrench
them
free
the
tribesmen
stared
blankly
but
at
a
snapped
order
they
imitated
him
soon
two
dozen
masses
of
firm
light
fungus
lay
upon
the
shore
burl
began
to
explain
what
they
were
for
but
dor
remonstrated
they
were
afraid
to
part
from
him
if
they
might
embark
on
the
same
it
would
be
a
different
matter
old
tama
scolded
him
shrilly
at
the
thought
of
separation
jon
trembled
at
the
mere
idea
burl
cast
an
apprehensive
glance
at
the
sky
day
was
rapidly
approaching
soon
the
red
puffballs
would
burst
and
shoot
their
into
the
air
this
was
no
time
to
make
stipulations
then
saya
spoke
softly
burl
made
the
suggested
great
sacrifice
he
took
the
gorgeous
velvet
cloak
of
from
his
shoulder
and
tore
it
into
a
dozen
long
irregular
pieces
along
the
lines
of
the
sinews
reinforcing
it
he
planted
his
spear
upright
in
the
largest
raft
fastening
the
other
cranky
craft
to
it
with
the
improvised
lines
in
a
matter
of
minutes
the
small
flotilla
of
rafts
bobbed
in
the
stream
one
by
one
burl
settled
the
folk
upon
them
with
stern
commands
about
movement
then
he
shoved
them
out
from
the
bank
the
collection
of
uneasy
floating
things
moved
slowly
out
from
shore
to
where
the
current
caught
them
burl
and
saya
sat
on
the
same
section
of
fungus
the
other
trustful
but
frightened
clustered
timorously
about
as
they
began
to
move
between
the
banks
of
the
river
and
as
the
mist
of
nighttime
lifted
from
its
surface
columns
of
red
dust
spurted
sullenly
upward
on
the
plain
in
the
light
of
dawn
the
deadly
red
haze
was
forming
once
more
over
the
puffball
plain
by
that
time
however
the
unstable
rafts
were
speeding
down
the
river
bobbing
and
whirling
in
the
stream
with
people
as
their
passengers
gazing
in
wonderment
at
the
shores
five
miles
downstream
the
red
growths
became
less
numerous
and
other
forms
of
fungus
took
their
places
moulds
and
rusts
covered
the
ground
as
grass
did
on
more
favored
planets
toadstools
showed
their
creamy
rounded
heads
and
there
were
malformed
things
with
swollen
trunks
and
branches
mocking
the
trees
that
were
never
seen
in
these
lowlands
once
the
tribesmen
saw
the
grisly
bulk
of
a
outlined
on
the
all
through
the
long
day
they
rode
the
current
while
the
insect
life
that
had
been
absent
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
became
abundant
again
bees
once
more
droned
overhead
and
wasps
and
dragonflies
mosquitoes
appeared
to
be
driven
off
with
blows
glittering
beetles
made
droning
or
booming
noises
as
they
flew
flies
of
every
imaginable
metallic
hue
flew
about
huge
butterflies
danced
above
the
steaming
land
and
running
river
in
seeming
ecstasy
at
simply
being
alive
all
the
forms
of
insect
life
flew
and
crawled
and
swam
and
dived
where
the
people
of
the
rafts
could
see
them
came
lazily
to
the
surface
to
snap
at
other
insects
on
the
surface
the
boats
of
floated
in
the
eddies
and
backwaters
the
day
wore
on
and
the
shores
flowed
by
the
tribesmen
ate
of
their
food
and
drank
of
the
river
when
afternoon
came
the
banks
fell
away
and
the
current
slackened
the
shores
became
indefinite
the
river
merged
itself
into
a
vast
swamp
from
which
came
a
continual
muttering
the
water
seemed
to
grow
dark
when
black
mud
took
the
place
of
the
clay
that
had
formed
its
bed
then
there
appeared
floating
green
things
which
did
not
move
with
the
flowing
water
they
were
the
leaves
of
the
that
managed
to
survive
along
with
cabbages
and
a
very
few
other
plants
in
the
midst
of
a
fungus
world
twelve
feet
across
any
one
of
the
green
leaves
might
have
supported
the
whole
of
burl
tribe
they
became
so
numerous
that
only
a
relatively
narrow
uncovered
stream
flowed
between
tens
of
acres
of
the
flat
floating
leaves
here
and
there
colossal
waxen
blossoms
could
be
seen
three
men
could
hide
in
those
enormous
flowers
they
exhaled
an
almost
overpowering
fragrance
into
the
air
and
presently
the
muttering
sound
that
had
been
heard
far
away
grew
in
volume
to
an
intermittent
roar
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
banks
on
either
side
it
was
the
discordant
croaking
of
frogs
eight
feet
in
length
which
lived
and
throve
in
this
swamp
presently
the
tribesfolk
saw
them
green
giants
sitting
immobile
upon
the
banks
only
opening
their
huge
mouths
to
croak
here
in
the
swamps
there
was
such
luxuriance
of
insect
life
that
a
normal
tribal
in
which
tribesmen
were
not
yet
accustomed
to
hunt
would
seem
like
a
desert
by
comparison
myriads
of
little
midges
no
more
than
three
or
four
inches
across
their
wings
danced
above
the
water
butterflies
flew
low
seemingly
enamoured
of
their
reflections
in
the
glassy
water
the
people
watched
as
if
their
eyes
would
become
engorged
by
the
strange
new
things
they
saw
where
the
river
split
and
split
and
divided
again
there
was
nothing
with
which
they
were
familiar
mushrooms
did
not
grow
here
moulds
yes
but
there
were
cattails
with
stalks
like
trees
towering
thirty
feet
above
the
waterways
after
a
long
long
time
though
the
streams
began
to
rejoin
each
other
then
low
hills
loomed
through
the
thicker
haze
that
filled
the
air
here
the
river
flowed
toward
and
through
them
and
here
a
wall
of
high
mountains
rose
toward
the
sky
but
their
height
could
not
be
guessed
they
vanished
in
the
mist
even
before
the
swallowed
them
the
river
flowed
through
a
a
in
the
mountains
while
day
still
held
fully
bright
the
bobbing
rafts
went
whirling
through
a
narrow
pass
with
sheer
walls
that
rose
beyond
all
seeing
in
the
mist
here
there
was
even
some
white
water
above
it
spanning
a
chasm
five
hundred
feet
across
a
banded
spider
had
flung
its
web
the
rafts
floated
close
enough
to
see
the
spider
a
monster
even
of
its
kind
its
belly
swollen
to
a
diameter
of
yards
it
hung
motionless
in
the
center
of
the
snare
as
the
humans
swept
beneath
it
then
the
mountains
drew
back
and
the
tribe
was
in
a
valley
where
look
as
they
might
there
was
no
single
puffball
from
whose
spreading
range
the
tribesmen
were
refugees
the
rafts
grounded
and
they
waded
ashore
while
still
the
day
held
and
there
was
food
here
in
plenty
but
darkness
fell
before
they
could
explore
as
a
matter
of
precaution
burl
and
his
folk
found
a
in
a
and
hid
until
morning
the
were
wholly
familiar
to
them
the
noise
of
katydids
was
louder
than
usual
the
feminine
sound
of
that
name
gives
no
hint
of
the
sonorous
notes
the
enlarged
creatures
uttered
and
that
implied
more
vegetation
as
compared
with
straight
fungoid
flora
a
great
many
fireflies
glowed
in
the
darkness
shrouding
the
indicating
that
the
huge
snails
they
fed
on
were
plentiful
the
snails
would
make
very
suitable
prey
for
the
tribesmen
also
but
men
were
not
yet
established
in
their
own
minds
as
predators
they
were
though
definitely
no
longer
the
furtive
vermin
they
had
been
they
knew
there
were
such
things
as
weapons
they
had
killed
ants
for
food
and
a
as
an
exercise
in
courage
to
some
degree
they
were
acquiring
burl
own
qualities
but
they
were
still
behind
him
and
he
still
had
some
way
to
go
the
next
day
they
explored
their
new
territory
with
a
boldness
which
would
have
been
unthinkable
a
few
weeks
before
the
new
haven
was
a
valley
spreading
out
to
a
second
swamp
at
its
lower
end
they
could
not
know
it
but
beyond
the
swamp
lay
the
sea
exploring
because
of
strictly
practical
purposes
and
not
for
the
sake
of
knowledge
they
found
a
great
in
the
earth
sure
sign
of
the
lair
of
a
spider
burl
considered
that
before
many
days
the
monster
would
have
to
be
dealt
with
but
he
did
not
yet
know
how
it
could
be
done
his
people
were
rapidly
becoming
a
tribe
of
men
but
they
still
needed
burl
to
think
for
them
what
he
could
not
think
out
so
far
could
not
be
done
but
a
part
of
the
proof
that
they
needed
burl
to
think
for
them
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
did
not
realize
it
they
gathered
facts
about
their
environment
the
nearest
was
miles
away
that
meant
that
they
would
encounter
its
scouting
foragers
rather
than
the
would
be
a
source
of
small
prey
a
notion
that
would
have
been
inconceivable
a
little
while
ago
there
were
numerous
giant
cabbages
in
the
valley
and
that
meant
there
were
big
defenseless
slugs
to
spear
whenever
necessary
they
saw
the
adults
were
eighteen
feet
tall
and
as
big
as
giraffes
but
much
less
desirable
neighbors
and
knew
that
they
would
have
to
be
avoided
but
there
were
edible
mushrooms
on
every
hand
if
one
avoided
spiders
and
and
the
beetles
if
one
were
safely
hidden
at
night
against
the
amorous
male
spiders
who
took
time
off
from
courtship
to
devour
anything
living
that
came
their
way
and
if
one
lived
at
alertness
interpreting
every
sound
as
possible
danger
and
every
unknown
thing
as
certain
peril
then
one
could
live
quite
comfortably
in
this
valley
for
three
days
the
tribesmen
felt
that
they
had
found
a
sort
of
paradise
jon
had
his
belly
full
to
bursting
all
day
long
tet
and
dik
became
skilled
dor
found
a
better
spear
and
practiced
thoughtfully
with
it
there
were
no
red
puffballs
here
there
was
food
burl
folk
could
imagine
no
greater
happiness
even
old
tama
scolded
only
rarely
they
surely
could
not
conceive
of
any
place
where
a
man
might
walk
calmly
about
with
no
danger
at
all
of
being
devoured
this
was
paradise
and
it
was
a
deplorable
state
of
affairs
it
is
not
good
for
human
beings
to
feel
secure
and
experience
contentment
men
achieve
only
by
their
wants
or
through
their
fears
back
at
their
former
the
tribe
would
never
have
emulated
burl
with
any
passion
so
long
as
they
could
survive
by
traditional
behavior
before
the
menace
of
the
red
puffballs
developed
he
had
brought
them
to
the
point
of
killing
ants
with
him
present
and
ready
to
assist
they
would
have
stayed
at
about
that
level
the
red
dust
had
forced
their
flight
during
that
flight
they
had
achieved
what
was
compared
to
their
former
timidity
prodigies
of
valor
but
now
they
arrived
at
paradise
there
was
food
they
could
survive
here
in
the
fashion
of
the
good
old
days
before
they
learned
the
courage
of
desperation
they
did
not
need
burl
to
keep
them
alive
or
to
feed
them
they
tended
to
disregard
him
but
they
did
not
disperse
social
grouping
is
an
instinct
in
human
beings
as
it
is
in
cattle
or
in
schools
of
fish
also
when
burl
was
available
there
was
a
sense
of
pleasant
confidence
he
had
gotten
them
out
of
trouble
before
if
more
trouble
came
he
would
get
them
out
of
it
again
but
why
look
for
trouble
burl
tribesmen
sank
back
into
a
contented
lethargy
they
found
food
and
hid
themselves
until
it
was
all
consumed
a
part
of
the
valley
was
found
where
they
were
far
enough
from
visible
dangers
to
feel
blissfully
safe
when
they
did
move
though
still
with
elaborate
caution
it
was
only
to
forage
for
food
and
they
did
not
need
to
go
far
because
there
was
plenty
of
food
they
slipped
back
happier
than
they
had
ever
been
the
foragers
finally
began
to
forget
to
take
their
new
spears
or
clubs
with
them
they
were
furtive
vermin
in
a
particularly
favorable
environment
and
burl
was
infuriated
he
had
known
adulation
he
was
cherished
to
be
sure
but
adulation
no
longer
came
his
way
even
saya
an
ironically
natural
change
took
place
in
saya
when
burl
was
a
chieftain
she
looked
at
him
with
worshipful
eyes
now
that
he
was
as
other
men
she
displayed
coquetry
and
burl
was
of
that
peculiarly
sort
of
human
being
who
is
capable
of
leadership
but
not
of
intrigue
he
was
vain
of
course
but
he
could
not
engage
in
elaborate
maneuvers
to
build
up
a
romantic
situation
when
saya
archly
remained
with
the
women
of
the
tribe
he
considered
that
she
avoided
him
when
she
coyly
avoided
speech
with
him
he
angrily
believed
that
she
did
not
want
his
company
when
they
had
been
in
the
valley
for
a
week
burl
went
off
on
a
bitter
journey
by
himself
part
of
his
motivation
probably
was
a
childish
resentment
he
had
been
the
great
man
of
the
tribe
he
was
no
longer
so
great
because
his
particular
qualities
were
not
needed
and
perhaps
with
some
unconscious
intent
to
punish
them
for
their
lessened
appreciation
he
went
off
in
a
pet
he
still
carried
spear
and
club
but
the
grandeur
of
his
costume
had
deteriorated
his
cloak
was
gone
the
he
had
worn
bound
to
his
forehead
were
now
so
draggled
that
they
were
ridiculous
he
went
off
angrily
to
be
rid
of
his
fellows
indifference
he
found
the
upward
slopes
which
were
the
valley
literal
boundaries
they
promised
nothing
he
found
a
minor
valley
in
which
a
labyrinth
spider
had
built
its
shining
snare
burl
almost
scorned
the
creature
he
could
kill
it
if
he
chose
merely
by
stabbing
it
though
the
walls
of
its
silken
nest
as
it
waited
for
unlucky
insects
to
blunder
into
the
intricate
web
he
saw
once
he
came
upon
that
extraordinary
of
the
mantis
tribe
a
gigantic
mass
of
solidified
foam
whipped
out
of
some
special
plastic
compound
which
the
mantis
secretes
and
in
which
the
eggs
are
laid
he
found
a
caterpillar
wrapped
in
its
thick
cocoon
and
because
he
was
not
foraging
and
not
particularly
hungry
he
inspected
it
with
care
with
great
difficulty
he
even
broke
the
strand
of
silk
that
formed
it
unreeling
several
feet
in
curiosity
had
he
meditated
burl
would
have
seen
that
this
was
cord
which
could
be
used
to
build
snares
as
spiders
did
it
could
also
be
used
to
make
defenses
in
which
if
built
strongly
and
well
even
might
be
tangled
and
dispatched
but
again
he
was
not
knowingly
looking
for
things
to
be
of
use
he
coddled
his
sense
of
injury
against
the
tribe
he
punished
them
by
leaving
them
he
encountered
a
that
raised
its
forelimbs
and
waited
immobile
for
him
to
come
within
reach
he
had
trouble
getting
away
without
a
fight
his
spear
would
have
been
a
clumsy
weapon
against
so
slender
a
target
and
the
club
certainly
not
quick
enough
to
counter
the
insect
movements
he
was
bothered
that
day
he
hunted
ants
the
difficulty
was
mainly
that
of
finding
individual
ants
alone
who
could
be
slaughtered
without
drawing
hordes
of
others
into
the
fight
before
nightfall
he
had
three
of
them
carcasses
slung
at
his
belt
near
sunset
he
came
upon
another
fairly
recent
hatchling
it
was
almost
an
ambush
the
young
monster
stood
completely
immobile
and
waited
for
him
to
walk
into
its
reach
burl
performed
a
deliberate
experiment
something
that
had
not
been
done
for
a
very
long
time
on
the
forgotten
planet
the
small
grisly
creature
stood
as
high
as
burl
shoulders
it
would
be
a
deadly
antagonist
burl
tossed
it
a
dead
ant
it
struck
so
swiftly
that
the
motion
of
its
horrible
forearms
could
not
be
seen
then
it
ignored
burl
devouring
the
tidbit
it
was
a
discovery
that
was
immediately
and
urgently
useful
on
the
second
day
of
his
aimless
journey
burl
saw
something
that
would
be
even
more
deadly
and
appalling
than
the
red
dust
had
been
for
his
kind
it
was
a
female
black
the
american
tarantula
when
he
glimpsed
the
thing
the
blood
drained
from
face
as
the
monster
moved
out
of
sight
burl
abandoning
any
other
project
he
might
have
intended
headed
for
the
place
his
tribe
had
more
or
less
settled
in
he
had
news
which
offered
the
satisfaction
of
making
him
again
but
he
would
have
traded
that
pleasure
ten
hundred
times
over
for
the
simple
absence
of
that
one
creature
from
this
valley
that
female
tarantula
meant
simply
and
specifically
that
the
tribe
must
flee
or
die
this
place
was
not
paradise
the
entry
of
the
spider
into
the
region
had
preceded
the
arrival
of
the
people
a
giant
even
of
its
kind
it
had
come
across
some
pass
among
the
mountains
for
reasons
only
it
could
know
but
it
was
deadliness
beyond
compare
its
legs
spanned
yards
the
fangs
were
and
feet
in
length
and
poisoned
its
eyes
glittered
with
insatiable
insane
its
coming
was
ten
times
more
deadly
to
the
humans
as
to
the
other
living
creatures
of
the
valley
than
a
bengal
tiger
loosed
in
a
human
city
would
have
been
it
was
bad
enough
in
itself
but
it
brought
more
deadly
disaster
still
behind
it
bumping
and
bouncing
behind
its
abdomen
as
it
moved
fastened
to
its
body
by
dirtied
silken
ropes
this
creature
dragged
a
burden
which
was
its
own
ferocity
many
times
multiplied
it
was
dragging
an
larger
than
its
body
which
was
feet
in
diameter
the
female
spider
would
carry
this
ghastly
burden
cherishing
it
until
the
eggs
hatched
and
then
there
would
be
four
to
five
hundred
small
devils
loose
in
the
valley
from
the
instant
of
their
hatching
they
would
be
as
deadly
as
their
parent
though
the
offspring
would
be
small
with
legs
spanning
no
more
than
a
foot
their
bodies
would
be
the
size
of
a
man
fist
and
able
to
leap
two
yards
their
tiny
fangs
would
be
no
less
envenomed
than
their
mother
in
stark
maniacal
hatred
of
all
other
life
they
would
at
least
equal
the
huge
gray
horror
which
had
begot
them
burl
told
his
tribesmen
they
listened
eyes
large
with
fright
but
not
quite
afraid
the
thing
had
not
yet
happened
when
burl
insistently
commanded
that
they
follow
him
on
a
new
journey
they
nodded
uneasily
but
slipped
away
he
could
not
gather
the
tribe
together
always
there
were
members
who
hid
from
him
and
when
he
went
in
search
of
them
the
ones
he
had
gathered
vanished
before
he
could
return
there
were
days
of
bright
light
and
murder
and
nights
of
slow
rain
and
death
in
the
valley
the
great
creatures
under
the
committed
atrocities
upon
each
other
and
blandly
dined
upon
their
victims
unthinkingly
solicitous
parents
paralyzed
creatures
to
be
left
living
and
helpless
for
their
young
to
feed
on
there
were
enormities
of
cruelty
done
in
the
fashion
of
the
insect
world
to
these
things
the
humans
were
indifferent
they
were
uneasy
but
like
other
humans
everywhere
they
would
not
believe
the
worst
until
the
worst
arrived
two
weeks
after
their
coming
to
the
valley
the
worst
was
there
when
that
day
came
the
first
gray
light
of
dawn
found
the
humans
in
a
shivering
terrified
group
in
a
completely
suicidal
position
they
were
out
in
the
open
not
hidden
but
in
plain
view
they
dared
not
hide
any
more
the
furry
gray
monster
brood
had
hatched
the
valley
seemed
to
swarm
with
small
gray
demons
which
killed
and
killed
even
when
they
could
not
devour
when
they
encountered
each
other
they
fought
in
slavering
fury
and
the
victors
in
such
duels
dined
upon
their
brethren
but
always
they
hunted
for
more
things
to
kill
they
were
literally
maniacs
and
they
were
too
small
and
too
quick
to
fight
with
spears
or
clubs
so
now
at
daybreak
the
humans
looked
about
despairingly
for
death
to
come
to
them
they
had
spent
the
night
in
the
open
lest
they
be
trapped
in
the
very
thickets
that
had
formerly
been
their
protection
they
were
in
clear
sight
of
the
large
gray
murderer
if
it
should
pass
that
way
and
they
did
not
dare
hide
because
of
that
ogreish
creature
brood
the
monster
appeared
a
young
girl
saw
it
and
cried
out
chokingly
it
had
not
seen
them
they
watched
it
leap
upon
and
murder
a
caterpillar
near
the
limit
of
vision
in
the
it
was
in
the
tribe
part
of
the
valley
its
young
swarmed
everywhere
the
valley
could
have
been
a
paradise
but
it
was
doomed
to
become
a
and
then
burl
shook
himself
he
had
been
angry
when
he
left
his
tribe
he
had
been
more
angry
when
he
returned
and
they
would
not
obey
him
he
had
remained
with
them
petulantly
silent
displaying
the
offended
dignity
he
felt
and
elaborately
refusing
to
acknowledge
any
overtures
even
from
saya
burl
had
acted
rather
childishly
but
his
tribesmen
were
like
children
it
was
the
best
way
for
him
to
act
they
shivered
too
hopeless
even
to
run
away
while
the
shaggy
monster
feasted
a
away
there
were
six
men
and
seven
women
besides
himself
and
the
rest
were
children
from
gangling
adolescents
to
one
babe
in
arms
they
whimpered
a
little
then
saya
looked
imploringly
at
burl
coquetry
forgotten
now
the
other
whimpered
more
loudly
they
had
reached
that
stage
of
despair
now
when
they
could
draw
the
monster
to
them
by
blubbering
in
terror
this
was
the
psychological
moment
burl
said
dourly
come
he
took
saya
hand
and
started
away
there
was
but
one
direction
in
which
any
human
being
could
think
to
move
in
this
valley
at
this
moment
it
was
the
direction
away
from
the
grisly
mother
of
horrors
it
happened
to
be
the
way
up
the
valley
wall
burl
started
up
that
slope
saya
went
with
him
before
they
had
gone
ten
yards
dor
spoke
to
his
wife
they
followed
burl
with
their
three
children
five
yards
more
and
jak
agitatedly
began
to
bustle
his
family
into
movement
old
jon
wheezing
frantically
scuttled
after
burl
and
cori
competently
set
out
with
the
youngest
of
her
children
in
her
arms
and
the
others
marching
before
her
within
seconds
more
all
the
tribe
was
in
motion
burl
moved
on
aware
of
his
following
but
ignoring
it
the
procession
continued
in
his
wake
simply
because
it
had
begun
to
do
so
dik
his
adolescent
brashness
beaten
down
by
terror
nevertheless
regarded
stained
weapon
with
the
inevitable
envy
of
the
for
achievement
he
saw
something
in
the
soil
and
after
a
fearful
glance
behind
he
moved
aside
to
tug
at
it
it
was
part
of
the
armor
of
a
former
rhinoceros
beetle
tet
joined
him
they
made
an
act
of
great
daring
of
lingering
to
find
themselves
weapons
as
near
as
possible
to
burl
a
on
the
fugitives
passed
a
struggling
milkweed
plant
no
more
than
twenty
feet
high
and
already
scabrous
with
scale
and
rusts
upon
its
lower
parts
ants
marched
up
and
down
its
stalk
in
a
steady
single
file
placing
aphids
from
their
nearby
on
suitable
spots
to
feed
and
to
multiply
as
only
parthenogenic
aphids
can
do
but
already
on
the
far
side
of
the
milkweed
an
climbed
up
to
do
murder
among
them
the
of
course
was
the
larval
form
of
a
fly
the
aphids
were
its
predestined
prey
burl
continued
to
march
holding
saya
hand
the
reek
of
formic
acid
came
to
his
nostrils
he
ignored
it
ants
were
as
much
prey
to
his
tribesmen
now
as
crabs
and
crayfish
to
other
tribesmen
on
earth
but
burl
was
not
concerned
with
food
now
he
stalked
on
toward
the
dik
and
tet
brandished
their
new
weapons
they
looked
fearfully
behind
them
the
monster
from
whom
they
fled
was
lost
in
its
gruesome
feasting
and
they
were
a
long
way
from
it
now
there
was
a
steady
procession
of
ants
with
occasional
gaps
in
the
line
the
procession
passed
the
line
through
one
of
those
gaps
beyond
it
tet
and
dik
conferred
they
dared
each
other
they
went
scrambling
back
to
the
line
of
ants
their
weapons
smote
the
slaughtered
ants
died
instantly
and
were
quickly
dragged
from
the
path
the
remaining
ants
went
placidly
on
their
way
the
weapons
struck
again
the
two
adolescents
had
to
outdo
each
other
but
they
had
as
much
food
as
they
could
carry
gloating
each
claiming
to
have
been
most
daring
and
to
have
the
largest
bag
of
game
they
ran
panting
after
the
tribe
they
grandly
distributed
their
take
of
game
it
was
a
form
of
boasting
but
the
tribesfolk
accepted
the
gifts
automatically
it
was
after
all
food
the
two
gangling
boys
jabbering
at
each
other
raced
back
once
more
again
they
returned
with
dangling
masses
of
foodstuff

limbs

meat

his
onslaught
into
the
stupidly
feasting

took
alarm
and
thrust
forward
to
offer
battle
tumult
arose
upon
the
milkweed
but
burl
led
his
followers
toward
the
mountainside
he
reached
a
minor
eminence
and
looked
about
him
caution
was
the
price
of
existence
on
this
world
two
hundred
feet
away
a
small
scurrying
horror
raged
and
searched
among
the
layers
of
what
on
other
worlds
was
called
or
here
it
was
thick
as
quilting
and
infinitesimal
creatures
denned
under
it
the
spider
devoured
them
making
gluttonous
sounds
but
it
was
busy
and
all
spiders
are
relatively
burl
turned
to
saya
and
realized
that
all
his
tribe
had
followed
him
fearfully
even
to
this
small
height
he
climbed
only
to
look
around
from
dor
had
taken
advantage
of
burl
pause
there
was
an
empty
partly
overwhelmed
by
the
fungoid
soil
he
tore
free
a
jaw
it
was
curved
and
sharp
and
deadly
if
properly
wielded
dor
had
seen
burl
kill
things
he
had
even
helped
now
very
grimly
he
tried
to
imagine
killing
something
all
alone
jak
saw
him
working
on
the
weapon
he
tugged
at
the
ransacked
carcass
for
another
weapon
dik
and
tet
vaingloriously
pretended
to
fight
between
themselves
with
their
recently
acquired
instruments
for
killing
jon
wheezed
and
panted
old
tama
complained
to
herself
in
whispers
not
daring
to
make
sounds
in
the
daylight
the
rest
waited
until
burl
should
lead
them
further
when
burl
turned
angry
eyes
upon
them
he
was
beginning
to
do
such
things
deliberately
now
they
all
regarded
him
humbly
now
they
remembered
that
they
had
been
hungry
and
he
had
gotten
food
for
them
and
they
had
been
paralyzed
by
terror
and
he
dared
to
move
they
definitely
had
a
feeling
of
dependence
upon
him
for
the
present
moment
only
later
their
feeling
of
humbleness
would
diminish
in
proportion
as
he
met
their
needs
for
leadership
they
would
tend
to
try
to
become
independent
of
him
his
leadership
would
be
successful
in
proportion
as
he
taught
them
to
lead
themselves
but
burl
perceived
this
only
dimly
at
the
moment
it
was
pleasing
to
have
all
his
tribe
regard
him
so
worshipfully
even
if
not
in
quite
the
same
fashion
as
saya
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
now
at
any
rate
while
they
were
so
frightened
they
would
obey
him
so
he
invented
an
order
for
them
to
obey
i
carry
sharp
things
he
said
sternly
some
of
you
have
gotten
sharp
things
now
everybody
must
carry
sharp
things
to
fight
with
humbly
they
scattered
to
obey
saya
would
have
gone
with
them
but
burl
held
her
back
he
did
not
quite
know
why
it
could
have
been
that
the
absolute
equality
of
the
sexes
in
cravenness
was
due
to
end
and
for
his
own
vanity
burl
would
undertake
the
defense
of
saya
he
did
not
analyze
so
far
he
did
not
want
her
to
leave
him
so
he
prevented
it
the
tribesfolk
scattered
dor
went
with
his
wife
to
help
her
arm
herself
jak
uneasily
followed
his
jon
went
timorously
where
the
remnant
of
the
cricket
carcass
might
still
yield
an
instrument
of
defense
cori
laid
her
youngest
child
at
burl
feet
while
she
went
fearfully
to
find
some
toothed
instrument
meeting
specification
of
sharpness
there
was
a
stifled
scream
a
boy
he
was
dik
younger
brother
stood
paralyzed
he
stared
in
an
agony
of
horror
at
something
that
had
stepped
from
behind
a
misshapen
fungoid
object
fifty
yards
from
burl
but
less
than
ten
yards
from
him
it
was
a
pallidly
greenish
creature
with
a
small
head
and
enormous
eyes
it
stood
upright
like
a
man
and
it
was
a
few
inches
taller
than
a
man
its
abdomen
swelled
gracefully
into
a
leaflike
form
the
boy
faced
it
paralyzed
by
horror
and
it
stood
its
great
hideously
spined
arms
were
spread
out
in
a
pose
of
hypocritical
benediction
it
was
a
praying
mantis
not
too
long
hatched
it
stood
rigid
waiting
benignly
for
the
boy
to
come
closer
or
try
to
flee
if
he
had
fled
it
would
fling
itself
after
him
with
a
ferocity
beside
which
the
fury
of
a
tiger
would
be
kittenish
if
he
approached
its
fanged
arms
would
flash
down
pierce
his
body
and
hold
him
terribly
fast
by
the
hooks
that
were
so
much
worse
than
and
of
course
it
would
not
wait
for
him
to
die
before
it
began
its
meal
all
the
small
party
of
humans
stood
frozen
it
may
be
questioned
whether
they
were
filled
with
horror
for
the
boy
or
cast
into
a
deeper
abyss
of
despair
by
the
sight
of
a
mantis
only
burl
so
far
had
any
notion
of
actually
leaving
the
valley
to
the
rest
the
discovery
of
one
partly
mature
praying
mantis
meant
that
there
would
be
hundreds
of
others
it
would
be
impossible
to
evade
the
tiny
slavering
demons
which
were
the
brood
of
the
great
spider
it
would
be
impossibility
multiplied
to
live
where
a
horde
of
small
yet
vastly
larger
fiends
lived
raising
their
arms
in
a
semblance
of
blessing
before
they
did
murder
only
burl
was
capable
of
thought
and
this
was
because
vanity
filled
him
he
had
commanded
and
had
been
obeyed
now
obedience
was
forgotten
because
there
was
this
young
mantis
if
the
men
had
dreamed
of
fighting
it
it
could
have
destroyed
any
number
of
them
by
sheer
ferocity
and
its
arsenal
of
knives
and
daggers
but
burl
was
at
once
furious
and
experienced
he
had
encountered
such
a
monster
when
alone
and
deliberately
had
experimented
with
it
in
consequence
he
could
dare
to
rage
he
ran
toward
the
mantis
he
swung
the
small
corpse
of
an
ant
killed
by
tet
only
minutes
since
and
hurled
it
past
the
boy
he
had
hurled
it
at
the
mantis
it
struck
and
insects
simply
do
not
think
something
hurtled
at
the
ghastly
young
creature
its
arms
struck
ferociously
to
defend
itself
the
ant
was
heavy
poised
upright
in
its
spectral
attitude
the
mantis
was
literally
flung
backward
but
it
rolled
over
fighting
the
dead
ant
with
that
frenzy
which
is
not
so
much
ferocity
as
mania
the
small
boy
fled
hysterically
once
the
insect
attention
was
diverted
the
human
tribe
gathered
around
burl
many
hundreds
of
yards
away
again
uphill
he
was
their
rendezvous
because
of
the
example
set
by
cori
she
had
left
her
baby
with
burl
when
burl
dashed
from
the
spot
saya
had
quite
automatically
followed
the
instinct
of
any
female
for
the
young
of
its
kind
she
snatched
up
the
baby
before
she
fled
and
of
course
she
joined
burl
when
the
immediate
danger
was
over
the
floor
of
the
valley
seemed
a
trifle
indistinct
from
here
the
mist
that
hung
always
in
the
air
partly
veiled
the
details
of
its
horrors
it
was
less
actual
not
quite
as
deadly
as
it
once
had
seemed
burl
said
fiercely
to
his
followers
where
are
the
sharp
things
the
tribesfolk
looked
at
one
another
numbly
then
jon
muttered
rebelliously
and
old
tama
raised
her
voice
in
shrill
complaint
burl
had
led
them
to
this
there
had
been
only
the
red
dust
in
the
place
from
which
they
had
come
but
here
was
a
and
its
young
and
also
a
new
hatching
of
mantises
they
could
dodge
the
red
dust
but
how
could
they
escape
the
deaths
that
waited
them
here
ai
ai
burl
had
persuaded
them
to
leave
their
home
and
brought
them
here
to
die
burl
glared
about
him
it
was
neither
courage
nor
resolution
but
he
had
come
to
realize
that
to
be
admired
by
one
fellows
was
a
splendid
sensation
the
more
one
was
admired
the
better
he
was
enraged
that
anyone
dared
to
despair
instead
of
thinking
admiringly
about
his
remarkableness
i
said
burl
haughtily
am
not
going
to
stay
here
i
go
to
a
place
where
there
are
neither
spiders
nor
mantises
come
he
held
out
his
hand
to
saya
she
gave
the
child
to
cori
and
confidently
moved
to
follow
him
burl
stalked
grandly
away
and
she
went
with
him
he
went
uphill
naturally
there
were
spiders
and
mantises
in
the
valley
so
many
that
to
stay
there
meant
death
so
he
moved
to
go
somewhere
else
and
this
was
the
climactic
event
that
changed
the
whole
history
of
humanity
upon
the
forgotten
planet
up
to
this
point
there
may
have
been
other
individuals
who
had
accomplished
somewhat
of
burl
kind
of
leadership
a
few
may
have
learned
courage
it
is
possible
that
some
even
led
their
tribesfolk
upon
migrations
in
search
of
safer
lands
to
live
in
but
until
burl
led
his
people
out
of
a
valley
filled
with
food
up
a
mountainside
toward
the
unknown
it
was
simply
impossible
for
humans
to
rise
permanently
above
the
status
of
hunted
vermin
at
the
mercy
of
monstrous
mindless
creatures
whose
forbears
had
most
ironically
been
brought
to
this
planet
to
prepare
it
for
humans
to
live
on
burl
was
the
first
man
to
lead
his
fellows
toward
the
heights
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
sun
that
shone
upon
the
forgotten
planet
was
actually
very
near
it
shone
on
the
top
of
the
and
the
clouds
glowed
with
dazzling
whiteness
it
shone
on
the
where
they
penetrated
the
mist
and
the
peaks
were
warmed
and
there
was
no
snow
anywhere
despite
the
height
there
were
winds
here
where
the
sun
yielded
sensible
heat
the
sky
was
very
blue
at
the
edge
of
the
plateau
from
which
the
were
down
instead
of
up
the
mountainsides
seemed
to
descend
into
a
sea
of
milk
great
undulations
in
the
mist
had
the
semblance
of
waves
which
moved
with
great
deliberation
toward
the
shores
they
seemed
sometimes
to
break
in
against
the
where
they
were
and
sometimes
they
seemed
to
flow
up
gentler
inclinations
like
water
flowing
up
a
beach
but
all
of
this
was
very
deliberate
indeed
because
the
were
sometimes
twenty
miles
from
crest
to
crest
the
look
of
things
was
different
on
the
highlands
this
part
of
the
unnamed
world
no
less
than
the
lowlands
had
been
seeded
with
life
on
two
separate
occasions
once
the
seedings
was
with
bacteria
and
moulds
and
lichens
to
break
up
the
rocks
and
make
soil
of
them
and
once
with
seeds
and
and
such
living
things
as
might
sustain
themselves
immediately
they
were
hatched
but
here
on
the
highlands
the
different
climatic
conditions
had
allowed
other
seedlings
and
creatures
to
survive
together
here
moulds
and
yeasts
and
rusts
were
stunted
by
the
sunlight
grasses
and
weeds
and
trees
survived
instead
this
was
an
ideal
environment
for
plants
that
needed
sunlight
to
form
chlorophyl
with
which
to
make
use
of
the
soil
that
had
been
formed
so
on
the
highlands
the
vegetation
was
almost
earthlike
and
there
was
a
remarkable
on
the
fauna
which
had
been
introduced
in
the
same
manner
and
at
the
same
time
as
the
creatures
down
below
in
coolness
which
amounted
to
a
temperate
climate
there
developed
no
such
frenzy
of
life
as
made
the
nightmare
jungles
under
the
clouds
plants
grow
at
a
slower
rate
than
fungi
and
less
luxuriantly
there
was
no
vast
supply
of
food
for
insects
which
were
to
survive
here
could
not
grow
to
be
monsters
moreover
the
nights
here
were
chill
very
many
insects
grow
torpid
in
the
cool
of
a
night
but
warm
up
to
activity
soon
after
sunrise
but
a
large
creature
made
torpid
by
cold
will
not
revive
so
quickly
if
large
enough
it
will
not
become
fully
active
until
close
to
dark
on
the
plateau
the
lowland
monsters
would
starve
in
any
case
but
more
they
would
have
only
a
fraction
of
each
day
of
full
activity
so
there
was
a
necessary
limit
to
the
size
of
the
creatures
that
lived
above
the
clouds
to
humans
from
other
planets
the
life
on
the
plateau
would
not
have
seemed
horrifying
at
all
save
for
the
absence
of
birds
to
sing
and
a
lack
of
small
mammals
to
hunt
or
merely
to
enjoy
the
untouched
sunlit
plateau
with
its
warm
days
and
briskly
chill
nights
would
have
impressed
most
civilized
men
as
an
ideal
habitation
but
burl
and
his
followers
were
hardly
prepared
to
see
it
that
way
at
first
glance
if
told
about
it
in
advance
they
would
have
thought
of
it
with
despair
but
they
did
not
know
beforehand
they
toiled
upward
their
leader
moved
by
such
ridiculous
motives
of
pride
and
vanity
as
have
caused
men
to
achieve
greatness
throughout
all
history
two
great
continents
were
discovered
back
on
earth
by
a
man
trying
to
get
spices
to
hide
the
gamey
flavor
of
meat
and
the
power
that
drives
was
first
discovered
and
tamed
by
men
making
bombs
to
destroy
their
fellows
there
were
precedents
for
foolish
motives
producing
results
far
from
foolishness
the
trudging
climbing
folk
crawled
up
the
hillside
they
reached
a
place
high
above
the
valley
burl
had
led
them
to
that
valley
grew
misty
in
appearance
presently
it
could
no
longer
be
seen
at
all
the
mist
they
had
taken
for
granted
all
their
lives
hid
from
them
everything
but
the
slanting
stony
wall
up
which
they
climbed
the
stone
was
mostly
covered
by
in
partly
overlapping
sheets
such
stuff
is
always
close
behind
the
bacteria
which
first
attack
a
on
a
slope
it
clings
while
soil
is
washed
downward
as
fast
as
it
is
formed
the
people
never
ate
of
course
it
produces
frightening
cramps
in
time
they
might
learn
that
when
thoroughly
dried
it
can
be
cooked
to
pliability
again
and
eaten
with
some
satisfaction
but
so
far
they
neither
knew
dryness
nor
fire
nor
had
they
ever
known
such
surroundings
as
presently
enveloped
them
a
slanting
rocky
mountainside
which
stretched
up
frighteningly
to
the
very
sky
grayness
overhead
grayness
also
to
one
side
the
side
away
from
the
mountain
and
equal
grayness
below
the
valley
from
which
they
had
come
could
no
longer
be
seen
even
as
a
different
shading
of
the
mist
and
as
they
scrambled
and
trudged
after
burl
his
followers
gradually
became
aware
of
the
utter
strangeness
of
all
about
them
for
one
result
they
grew
sick
and
dizzy
to
them
it
seemed
that
all
solidity
was
slowly
tilting
had
they
been
superstitious
they
might
have
thought
of
demons
preparing
to
punish
them
for
daring
to
come
to
such
a
place
but
quaintly
enough
burl
followers
had
developed
no
demonology
your
typical
savage
is
resolved
not
to
think
but
he
does
have
leisure
to
want
he
makes
gods
and
devils
out
of
his
nightmares
and
gambles
on
his
own
speculations
to
the
extent
of
offering
blackmail
to
demons
if
they
will
only
let
him
alone
or
preferably
give
him
more
of
the
things
he
wants
but
the
superstitions
of
savages
involve
the
payment
of
blackmail
in
exact
proportion
to
their
prosperity
the
eskimos
of
earth
lived
always
on
the
brink
of
starvation
they
could
not
afford
the
luxury
of
tabus
and
totem
animals
whose
flesh
must
not
be
eaten
and
forbidden
areas
which
might
contain
food
religion
there
was
among
burl
people
but
superstition
was
not
no
humans
anywhere
can
live
without
religion
but
on
earth
eskimos
did
with
a
minimum
of
superstitions
they
could
afford
no
more
and
the
humans
of
the
forgotten
planet
could
not
afford
any
at
all
therefore
they
climbed
desperately
despite
the
unparalleled
state
of
things
about
them
there
was
no
horizon
but
they
had
never
seen
a
horizon
their
feeling
was
that
what
had
been
down
was
now
partly
behind
and
they
feared
lest
a
toppling
universe
ultimately
let
them
fall
toward
that
grayness
they
considered
the
sky
but
all
kept
on
to
lag
behind
would
be
to
be
abandoned
in
this
place
where
all
known
sensations
were
turned
none
of
them
could
imagine
turning
back
even
old
tama
whimpering
in
a
whisper
as
she
struggled
to
keep
up
merely
complained
bitterly
of
her
fate
she
did
not
even
think
of
revolt
if
burl
had
stopped
all
his
followers
would
have
squatted
down
miserably
to
wait
for
death
they
had
no
thought
of
adventure
or
any
hope
of
safety
the
only
goodnesses
they
could
imagine
were
food
and
the
nearness
of
other
humans
they
had
food
nobody
had
abandoned
any
of
the
dangling
tet
and
dik
had
distributed
before
the
climb
began
they
would
not
be
separated
from
their
fellows
burl
motivation
was
hardly
more
distinct
he
had
started
uphill
in
a
judicious
mixture
of
fear
and
injured
vanity
and
desperation
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
going
back
the
terrors
at
hand
were
no
greater
than
those
behind
so
there
was
no
reason
not
to
go
ahead
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
sank
inward
there
was
a
flat
space
and
behind
it
a
winding
cañon
of
sorts
like
a
vast
crack
in
the
mountain
substance
burl
breasted
the
curving
edge
and
found
flatness
beyond
it
he
stopped
short
the
mouth
of
the
cañon
was
perhaps
fifty
yards
from
the
lip
of
the
downward
slope
so
much
space
was
practically
level
and
on
it
were
toadstools
and
milkweed
two
of
them
and
there
was
food
it
was
a
small
isolated
asylum
for
life
such
as
they
were
used
to
they
could
it
was
possible
that
they
could
have
found
a
place
of
safety
here
but
the
possibility
was
not
the
fact
they
saw
the
at
once
it
was
slung
between
the
opposite
by
cables
all
of
two
hundred
feet
long
the
radiating
cables
reached
down
to
anchorages
on
stone
the
winding
out
and
out
in
that
logarithmic
spiral
whose
properties
men
were
so
astonished
to
discover
were
fully
a
yard
apart
the
web
was
for
giant
game
it
was
empty
now
but
burl
saw
the
which
ran
from
the
very
center
of
the
web
to
the
there
was
a
rocky
shelf
on
the
on
it
rested
the
spider
almost
invisible
against
the
stone
with
one
furry
leg
touching
the
cable
the
slightest
touch
on
any
part
of
the
web
would
warn
it
instantly
burl
followers
accumulated
behind
him
old
jon
wheezing
was
audible
tama
ceased
her
complaints
to
survey
this
spot
it
might
be
it
could
be
a
haven
and
she
would
have
to
find
new
and
different
things
to
complain
about
in
consequence
the
itself
of
course
was
no
reason
for
them
to
be
alarmed
do
not
hunt
their
males
do
but
they
are
rarely
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
web
save
at
the
web
itself
was
no
reason
not
to
settle
here
but
there
was
a
reason
the
ground
before
the
web
between
the
web
and
themselves
was
a
of
murdered
creatures
of
dead
beetles
and
the
carapaces
of
other
giants
the
ovipositor
of
an
see
feet
of
springy
slender
tube
and
the
of
bees
and
the
draggled
antennae
of
moths
and
butterflies
something
very
terrible
lived
in
this
small
place
the
mountainsides
were
barren
of
food
for
big
flying
things
anything
which
did
fly
this
high
for
any
reason
would
never
land
on
sloping
foodless
stone
it
would
land
here
and
very
obviously
it
would
die
because
something
something
killed
things
as
they
came
it
denned
back
in
the
cañon
where
they
could
not
see
it
it
dined
here
the
humans
looked
and
shivered
all
but
burl
he
cast
his
eyes
about
for
better
weapons
than
he
possessed
he
chose
for
himself
a
magnificent
lance
grown
by
some
dead
thing
for
its
own
defense
he
pulled
it
out
of
the
ground
it
was
utterly
silent
here
on
the
heights
no
sounds
from
the
valley
rose
so
high
there
was
no
noise
except
the
small
creakings
made
as
burl
strove
to
free
the
new
splendid
weapon
for
himself
that
was
why
he
heard
the
gasp
which
somebody
uttered
in
default
of
a
scream
that
would
not
be
uttered
it
was
a
choked
a
strangled
an
inarticulate
sobbing
noise
he
saw
its
cause
there
was
a
thing
moving
toward
the
folk
from
the
recesses
of
the
cañon
it
moved
very
swiftly
it
moved
upon
impossibly
attenuated
legs
of
impossible
length
and
inconceivable
number
its
body
was
the
thickness
of
burl
own
and
from
it
came
a
smell
of
such
monstrous
foetor
that
any
man
smelling
it
would
gag
and
flee
even
without
fear
to
urge
him
on
the
creature
was
a
monstrous
millipede
forty
feet
in
length
with
features
of
purest
unadulterated
horror
it
did
not
appear
to
plan
to
spring
its
speed
of
movement
did
not
increase
as
it
neared
the
tribesfolk
it
was
not
rushing
like
the
furious
charge
of
the
murderers
burl
tribe
knew
it
simply
flowed
sinuously
toward
them
with
no
appearance
of
haste
but
at
a
rate
of
speed
they
could
not
conceivably
outrun
sticklike
legs
twitched
upward
and
caught
the
spinning
body
of
an
ant
the
creature
stopped
and
turned
its
head
about
and
seized
the
object
its
had
grasped
it
devoured
it
burl
shouted
again
and
again
there
was
a
rain
of
missiles
upon
the
creature
but
they
were
not
to
hurt
it
but
to
divert
its
incredibly
attention
its
legs
seized
the
things
flung
to
it
it
was
not
possible
to
miss
ten
fifteen
twenty
of
the
items
of
were
grasped
in
as
if
they
were
creatures
in
flight
burl
shoutings
took
effect
his
people
fled
to
the
side
of
the
level
lip
of
ground
they
climbed
frantically
past
the
opening
of
the
valley
they
fled
toward
the
heights
burl
was
the
last
to
retreat
the
monstrous
millipede
stood
immobile
trapped
for
the
moment
by
the
gratification
of
all
its
desires
it
was
absorbed
by
the
multitude
of
tiny
tidbits
with
which
it
had
been
provided
it
was
a
fact
to
burl
honor
that
he
debated
a
frantic
attack
upon
the
monster
in
its
insane
absorption
but
the
strangling
stench
was
deterrent
enough
he
fled
the
last
of
his
band
of
fugitives
to
leave
the
place
where
the
monstrous
creature
lived
and
preyed
as
he
left
it
it
was
still
crunching
the
small
meals
one
by
one
with
which
the
folk
had
supplied
it
they
went
on
up
the
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
of
course
that
the
creature
could
not
move
above
the
slanting
unquestionably
it
roamed
far
and
wide
upon
occasion
but
its
own
foetid
reek
would
make
impossible
any
idea
of
trailing
the
humans
by
scent
and
climbing
desperately
as
the
humans
did
it
would
be
unable
to
see
them
when
they
were
past
the
first
protuberance
of
the
mountain
in
twenty
minutes
they
slackened
their
pace
exhaustion
prompted
it
caution
ordered
it
because
here
they
saw
another
small
island
of
flatness
in
the
slanting
universe
which
was
all
they
could
see
save
mist
it
was
simply
a
place
where
boulders
had
piled
up
and
soil
had
formed
and
there
was
a
miniature
haven
for
life
other
than
moulds
which
could
grow
on
naked
stone
actually
there
was
a
space
a
hundred
feet
by
fifty
on
which
wholly
familiar
mushrooms
grew
it
was
a
thicket
like
a
detached
section
of
the
valley
itself
edible
fungi
grew
here
there
were
gray
puffballs
and
from
it
came
the
cheerful
loud
chirping
of
some
small
beetle
arrived
at
this
spot
nobody
could
possibly
know
how
but
happily
ensconsed
in
a
separate
bit
of
remote
from
the
dangers
of
the
valley
if
it
was
small
enough
it
would
even
be
safe
from
the
reeking
horror
of
the
cañon
just
below
it
they
broke
off
edible
mushrooms
here
and
ate
and
this
could
have
been
safety
for
them
save
for
the
giant
millipede
no
more
than
half
a
mile
below
old
jon
wheezed
querulously
that
here
was
food
and
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
go
further
just
now
here
was
food
burl
regarded
him
with
knitted
brows
jon
reaction
was
natural
enough
the
tribesfolk
had
never
tended
to
think
for
the
future
because
it
was
impossible
to
make
use
of
such
planning
even
burl
could
easily
enough
have
accepted
the
fact
that
this
was
safety
for
the
moment
and
food
for
the
moment
but
it
happened
that
to
settle
down
here
until
driven
out
would
and
at
this
moment
have
deprived
him
of
the
authority
he
had
so
recently
learned
to
enjoy
you
stay
he
said
haughtily
to
jon
i
go
on
to
a
better
place
where
nothing
is
to
be
feared
at
all
he
held
out
his
hand
to
saya
he
assailed
the
slope
again
heading
upward
in
the
mist
his
tribe
followed
him
dik
and
tet
of
course
because
they
were
boys
and
burl
led
on
to
high
adventures
in
which
so
far
nobody
had
been
killed
dor
followed
because
he
being
the
strongest
man
in
the
tribe
he
had
thoughtfully
realized
that
his
strength
was
not
as
useful
as
burl
brains
and
other
qualities
cori
followed
because
she
had
children
and
they
were
safer
where
burl
led
than
anywhere
else
the
others
followed
to
avoid
being
left
alone
the
procession
toiled
on
and
up
presently
burl
noticed
that
the
air
seemed
clearer
here
it
was
not
the
misty
only
half
transparent
stuff
of
the
valley
he
could
see
for
miles
to
right
and
left
he
realized
the
curvature
of
the
but
he
could
not
see
the
valley
the
mist
hid
that
suddenly
he
realized
that
he
saw
the
overhead
as
an
object
he
had
never
thought
of
it
specifically
before
to
him
it
had
been
simply
the
sky
now
he
saw
an
indefinite
lower
surface
which
yet
definitely
hid
the
heights
toward
which
he
moved
he
and
his
followers
were
less
than
a
thousand
feet
below
it
it
appeared
to
burl
that
presently
he
would
run
into
an
obstacle
which
would
simply
keep
him
from
going
any
further
the
idea
was
disheartening
but
until
it
happened
he
obstinately
climbed
on
he
observed
that
the
thing
which
was
the
sky
did
not
stay
still
it
moved
though
slowly
a
little
higher
he
could
see
that
there
were
parts
of
it
which
were
actually
lower
than
he
was
they
moved
also
but
they
moved
away
from
him
as
often
as
they
moved
toward
him
he
had
no
experience
of
any
dangerous
thing
which
did
not
leap
at
its
victims
therefore
he
was
not
afraid
in
fact
presently
he
noticed
that
the
whiteness
which
was
the
seemed
to
retreat
before
him
he
was
pleased
weak
things
like
humans
fled
from
enemies
here
was
something
which
fled
at
his
approach
his
followers
undoubtedly
saw
the
same
thing
burl
had
killed
spiders
he
was
a
remarkable
person
this
unknown
white
stuff
was
afraid
of
him
therefore
it
was
wise
to
stay
close
to
burl
burl
found
his
vanity
inflamed
by
the
fact
that
always
even
at
its
thickest
the
white
never
came
nearer
than
some
dozens
of
feet
he
swaggered
as
he
led
his
people
up
and
presently
there
was
brightness
about
them
it
was
a
greater
brightness
than
the
tribesfolk
had
ever
known
they
knew
daylight
as
a
grayness
in
which
one
could
see
here
was
a
brightness
that
shone
they
were
not
accustomed
to
brightness
they
were
not
accustomed
to
silence
either
the
noises
of
the
valley
were
like
all
the
noises
of
the
lowlands
they
had
been
in
the
ears
of
every
one
of
the
human
beings
since
they
could
hear
at
all
they
had
gradually
diminished
as
the
valley
dropped
behind
them
now
in
the
radiant
white
mist
which
was
the
there
were
no
sounds
at
all
and
the
fact
was
suddenly
startling
they
blinked
in
the
brightness
when
they
spoke
to
each
other
they
spoke
in
whispers
the
stone
underfoot
was
not
even
here
it
was
bare
and
bright
and
glistened
with
wetness
the
light
they
experienced
took
on
a
golden
tint
all
of
these
things
were
utterly
unparalleled
but
the
stillness
was
a
hush
instead
of
a
menacing
silence
the
golden
light
could
not
possibly
be
associated
with
fear
the
people
of
the
forgotten
planet
felt
most
likely
the
sort
of
promise
in
this
shining
tranquility
which
before
they
had
known
only
in
dreams
but
this
was
no
dream
they
came
up
through
the
surface
of
a
sea
of
mist
and
they
saw
before
them
a
shore
of
sunshine
they
saw
blue
and
sky
and
sunlight
for
the
first
time
the
light
smote
their
shins
and
brilliantly
colored
furry
garments
it
glittered
in
changing
flashes
upon
cloaks
made
of
butterfly
wings
it
sparkled
on
the
great
lance
carried
by
burl
in
the
lead
and
the
quite
preposterous
weapons
borne
by
his
followers
the
little
party
of
twenty
humans
waded
ashore
through
the
last
of
the
thinning
white
stuff
which
was
cloud
they
gazed
about
them
with
wondering
astonished
eyes
the
sky
was
blue
there
was
green
grass
and
again
there
was
sound
it
was
the
sound
of
wind
blowing
among
trees
and
of
things
living
in
the
sunshine
they
heard
insects
but
they
did
not
know
what
they
heard
the
shrill
small
musical
whirrings
the
small
cries
which
made
an
elfin
melody
everywhere
these
were
totally
strange
all
things
were
new
to
their
eyes
and
an
enormous
exultation
filled
them
from
ancestral
memories
they
somehow
knew
that
what
they
saw
was
right
was
normal
was
appropriate
and
proper
and
that
this
was
the
kind
of
world
in
which
humans
belonged
rather
than
the
seething
horror
of
the
lowlands
they
breathed
clean
air
for
the
first
time
in
many
generations
burl
shouted
in
his
triumph
and
his
voice
echoed
among
trees
and
hillsides
it
was
time
for
the
plateau
to
ring
with
the
shouting
of
a
man
in
triumph
men
climb
up
to
they
had
food
for
days
they
had
brought
mushroom
from
the
isolated
thicket
not
too
far
beneath
the
clouds
there
were
the
ants
that
dik
and
tet
had
distributed
grandly
and
not
all
of
which
had
been
used
to
secure
escape
from
the
cañon
of
the
millipede
had
they
found
other
food
immediately
they
would
have
settled
down
comfortably
in
the
fashion
normal
to
creatures
whose
idea
of
bliss
is
a
secure
and
food
on
hand
so
they
do
not
have
to
leave
it
somehow
they
believed
that
this
high
place
of
bright
light
and
new
colors
was
secure
but
they
had
no
and
though
they
did
accept
with
the
unreasoning
faith
of
children
and
savages
that
there
were
no
enemies
here
they
still
wanted
one
they
found
a
cave
it
was
small
so
that
it
would
be
crowded
with
all
of
them
in
it
but
as
it
turned
out
this
was
fortunate
at
some
time
it
had
been
occupied
by
some
other
creature
but
the
dirt
which
floored
it
had
settled
flat
and
showed
no
tracks
it
retained
faint
traces
of
a
smell
which
was
unfamiliar
but
not
unpleasing
it
held
no
connotation
of
danger
ants
stank
of
formic
acid
plus
the
musky
odor
of
their
particular
city
one
could
identify
not
only
the
kind
of
ant
but
its
home
city
by
sniffing
at
an
spiders
had
their
own
odor
the
smell
of
a
was
acrid
and
all
beetles
reeked
of
decay
and
of
course
there
were
those
bugs
whose
main
defense
was
an
effluvium
which
tended
to
strangle
all
but
the
happy
possessor
this
faint
smell
in
the
cave
was
different
the
humans
thought
vaguely
that
it
might
possibly
be
another
kind
of
man
actually
it
was
the
smell
of
a
animal
but
burl
and
his
fellows
knew
of
no
creature
but
themselves
they
had
come
above
the
clouds
a
bare
two
hours
before
sunset
of
which
they
knew
nothing
for
an
hour
they
marveled
staying
close
together
they
were
especially
astounded
by
the
sun
since
they
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it
but
presently
being
savages
they
accepted
it
they
could
not
cease
to
wonder
at
the
vegetation
about
them
they
were
accustomed
only
to
gigantic
fungi
and
the
few
straggling
plants
which
tried
so
desperately
to
bear
seed
before
they
were
devoured
here
they
saw
many
plants
and
no
fungi
and
they
did
not
see
anything
they
recognized
as
insects
they
looked
only
for
large
things
they
were
astounded
by
the
slenderness
and
toughness
of
the
plants
grass
fascinated
them
and
weeds
a
large
part
of
their
courage
came
from
the
absence
of
debris
upon
the
ground
the
of
spiders
were
marked
by
grisly
remnants
of
finished
meals
and
where
mantises
roamed
there
were
bits
of
transparent
and
sharp
spiny
bits
of
armor
not
tasty
enough
to
be
consumed
here
in
the
first
hour
of
their
exploration
they
saw
no
sign
that
an
insect
like
the
lowland
ones
had
ever
been
in
this
place
at
all
but
they
could
not
believe
the
monsters
never
came
they
correctly
and
pessimistically
assumed
that
their
coming
was
only
rare
the
cave
was
a
great
relief
trees
did
not
grow
close
enough
to
give
them
a
feeling
of
safety
though
they
were
ludicrously
amazed
at
the
invincible
hardness
of
tree
trunks
they
had
never
known
anything
but
and
stone
which
was
as
hard
as
the
trunks
of
those
growing
things
they
found
nothing
to
eat
but
they
were
not
yet
hungry
they
did
not
worry
about
food
while
they
still
had
remnants
from
their
climb
when
the
sun
sank
low
and
crimson
colorings
filled
the
west
they
were
less
happy
they
watched
the
glory
of
their
first
sunset
with
scared
incredulous
eyes
yellows
and
reds
and
purples
reared
toward
the
zenith
it
became
possible
to
look
at
the
sun
directly
they
saw
it
descend
behind
something
they
could
not
guess
at
then
there
was
darkness
the
fact
stunned
them
so
night
came
like
this
then
they
saw
the
stars
for
the
first
time
as
they
came
singly
into
being
and
the
folk
from
the
lowland
crowded
frantically
into
the
cave
with
its
faint
odor
of
having
once
been
occupied
by
something
else
they
filled
the
cave
tightly
but
burl
had
some
reluctance
to
admit
his
terror
he
and
saya
were
the
last
to
enter
and
nothing
happened
nothing
the
sounds
of
sunset
continued
they
were
strange
but
soothing
and
somehow
again
ancestral
memory
spoke
comfortingly
they
were
the
way
ought
to
be
burl
and
the
others
could
not
possibly
know
it
but
for
the
first
time
in
forty
generations
on
the
forgotten
planet
human
beings
were
in
an
environment
really
suited
to
them
it
had
a
rightness
and
a
goodness
which
was
obvious
in
spite
of
its
novelty
and
because
of
burl
own
special
experiences
he
was
a
little
bit
better
able
to
estimate
novelties
than
the
rest
he
listened
to
the
from
close
by
the
cave
small
entrance
he
heard
the
breathing
of
his
tribesfolk
he
felt
the
heat
of
their
bodies
keeping
the
crowded
enclosure
warm
enough
for
all
saya
held
fast
to
his
hand
for
the
reassurance
of
the
contact
he
was
wakeful
and
thinking
very
busily
and
painfully
but
saya
was
not
thinking
at
all
she
was
simply
proud
of
burl
she
felt
to
be
sure
a
tumult
which
was
fear
of
the
unknown
and
relief
from
much
greater
fear
of
the
familiar
she
felt
warm
prideful
memories
of
the
sight
of
burl
leading
and
commanding
the
others
she
had
absorbing
fresh
memories
of
the
look
and
feel
of
sunshine
and
mental
pictures
of
sky
and
grass
and
trees
which
she
had
never
seen
before
confusedly
she
remembered
that
burl
had
killed
a
spider
no
less
and
he
had
shown
how
to
escape
a
by
flinging
it
at
an
ant
and
he
had
grandly
led
the
others
up
a
mountainside
it
had
never
occurred
to
anybody
else
to
climb
and
the
giant
millipede
would
have
devoured
them
all
but
that
burl
gave
commands
and
set
the
example
and
he
had
marched
magnificently
up
the
mountainside
when
it
seemed
that
all
the
cosmos
twisted
and
prepared
to
drop
them
into
an
inverted
sky
saya
dozed
and
burl
sat
awake
listening
and
presently
with
heart
he
slipped
out
of
the
entrance
to
the
cave
and
stared
about
him
in
the
night
there
was
coolness
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
but
nightfall
was
not
long
past
there
were
smells
in
the
air
he
had
never
before
experienced
green
things
growing
and
the
peculiar
clean
odor
of
wind
that
has
been
bathed
in
sunshine
and
the
oddly
satisfying
smell
of
resinous
trees
but
burl
raised
his
eyes
to
the
heavens
he
saw
the
stars
in
all
their
glory
and
he
was
the
first
human
in
two
thousand
years
and
more
to
look
at
them
from
this
planet
there
were
myriads
upon
myriads
of
them
varying
in
brightness
from
stabbing
lights
to
infinitesimal
twinklings
they
were
of
every
possible
color
they
hung
in
the
sky
above
him
immobile
and
unthreatening
they
had
not
descended
they
were
very
beautiful
burl
stared
and
then
he
noticed
that
he
was
breathing
deeply
with
a
new
zest
he
was
filling
his
lungs
with
clean
cool
fragrant
air
such
as
men
were
intended
to
breathe
from
the
beginning
and
of
which
burl
and
many
others
had
been
deprived
it
was
almost
intoxicating
to
feel
so
splendidly
alive
and
unafraid
there
was
a
slight
sound
saya
stood
beside
him
trembling
a
little
to
leave
the
others
had
required
great
courage
but
she
had
come
to
realize
that
if
burl
was
in
danger
she
wished
to
share
it
they
heard
the
nightwind
and
the
orchestra
of
they
wandered
aside
from
the
and
saya
found
completely
primitive
and
satisfying
pride
in
the
courage
of
burl
who
was
actually
not
afraid
of
the
dark
her
own
uneasiness
became
something
which
merely
added
savor
to
her
pride
in
him
she
followed
him
wherever
he
went
to
examine
this
and
consider
that
in
the
nighttime
it
gave
her
enormous
satisfaction
at
once
to
think
of
danger
and
to
feel
so
safe
because
of
his
nearness
presently
they
heard
a
new
sound
in
the
night
it
was
very
far
away
and
not
in
the
least
like
any
sound
they
had
ever
heard
before
it
changed
in
pitch
as
do
not
it
was
a
baying
yelping
sound
it
rose
and
held
the
higher
note
and
abruptly
dropped
in
pitch
before
it
ceased
minutes
later
it
came
again
saya
shivered
but
burl
said
thoughtfully
that
is
a
good
sound
he
did
know
why
saya
shivered
again
she
said
reluctantly
i
am
cold
it
had
been
a
rare
sensation
in
the
lowlands
it
came
only
after
one
of
the
infrequent
thunderstorms
when
wetted
human
bodies
were
exposed
to
the
gusty
winds
that
otherwise
never
blew
but
here
the
nights
grew
cold
after
sundown
the
heat
of
the
ground
would
radiate
to
outer
space
with
no
clouds
to
intercept
it
and
before
dawn
the
temperature
might
drop
nearly
to
freezing
on
a
planet
so
close
to
its
sun
however
there
would
hardly
be
more
than
light
at
any
time
the
two
of
them
went
back
to
the
cave
it
was
warm
there
because
of
the
close
packing
of
bodies
and
many
breaths
burl
and
saya
found
places
to
rest
and
dozed
off
saya
hand
again
trustfully
in
burl
he
still
remained
awake
for
a
long
time
he
thought
of
the
stars
but
they
were
too
strange
to
estimate
he
thought
of
the
trees
and
grass
but
most
of
his
impressions
of
this
upper
world
were
so
remote
from
previous
knowledge
that
he
could
only
accept
them
as
they
were
and
defer
reflecting
upon
them
until
later
he
did
feel
an
enormous
complacency
at
having
led
his
followers
here
though
but
the
last
thing
he
actually
thought
about
before
his
eyes
blinked
shut
in
sleep
was
that
distant
howling
noise
he
had
heard
in
the
night
it
was
totally
novel
in
kind
and
yet
there
was
something
buried
among
the
items
of
his
racial
heritage
that
told
him
it
was
good
he
was
first
awake
of
all
the
tribesmen
and
he
looked
out
into
the
cold
and
pallid
grayness
of
he
saw
trees
one
side
was
brightly
lighted
by
comparison
and
the
other
side
was
dark
he
heard
the
tiny
singing
noises
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
place
presently
he
crawled
out
of
the
cave
again
the
air
was
biting
in
its
chill
it
was
an
excellent
reason
why
the
giant
insects
could
not
live
here
but
it
was
invigorating
to
burl
as
he
breathed
it
in
presently
he
looked
curiously
for
the
source
of
the
peculiar
light
he
saw
the
top
of
the
sun
as
it
peered
above
the
eastern
the
sky
grew
lighter
he
blinked
and
saw
it
rise
more
fully
into
view
he
thought
to
look
upward
and
the
stars
that
had
bewildered
him
were
nearly
gone
he
ran
to
call
saya
the
rest
of
the
tribe
waked
as
he
roused
her
one
by
one
they
followed
to
watch
their
first
sunrise
the
men
gaped
at
the
sun
as
it
filled
the
east
with
colorings
and
rose
and
rose
above
the
seemingly
steaming
layer
of
clouds
and
then
appeared
to
spring
free
of
the
horizon
and
swim
on
upward
the
women
stared
with
all
their
eyes
the
children
blinked
and
shivered
and
crept
to
their
mothers
for
warmth
the
women
enclosed
them
in
their
cloaks
and
they
thawed
and
peered
out
once
more
at
the
glory
of
sunshine
and
the
day
very
soon
too
they
realized
that
warmth
came
from
the
great
shining
body
in
the
sky
the
children
presently
discovered
a
game
it
was
the
first
game
they
had
ever
played
it
consisted
of
running
into
a
shaded
place
until
they
shivered
and
then
of
running
out
into
warm
sunshine
once
more
until
this
dawning
fear
was
the
motive
for
such
playing
as
they
did
now
they
gleefully
made
a
game
of
sunshine
in
this
first
morning
of
their
life
above
the
clouds
the
tribesmen
ate
of
the
food
they
had
brought
from
below
but
there
was
not
an
indefinite
amount
of
food
left
burl
ate
and
considered
darkly
and
presently
summoned
his
followers
attention
they
were
quite
contented
and
for
the
moment
felt
no
need
of
his
guidance
but
he
felt
need
of
admiration
he
spoke
abruptly
we
do
not
want
to
go
back
to
the
place
we
came
from
he
said
sternly
we
must
look
for
food
here
so
we
can
stay
for
always
today
we
find
food
it
was
a
seizure
of
the
initiative
it
was
the
linking
of
what
the
folk
most
craved
with
obedience
to
burl
it
was
the
device
by
which
dictators
seize
power
and
it
was
the
instinctive
action
of
a
leader
the
eating
men
murmured
agreement
there
was
a
certain
definite
idea
of
goodness
not
virtue
but
of
things
desirable
associated
with
what
burl
did
and
what
he
commanded
his
tribe
was
gradually
forming
a
habit
of
obedience
though
it
was
a
very
fragile
habit
up
to
now
he
led
them
exploring
as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
all
of
them
of
course
they
straggled
irregularly
behind
him
they
came
to
a
brook
and
regarded
it
with
amazement
there
were
no
leeches
no
greenish
algae
no
foaming
masses
of
scum
it
was
dear
greatly
daring
burl
tasted
it
he
drank
the
first
really
potable
water
in
a
very
long
time
for
his
race
on
this
planet
it
was
not
fouled
by
drainage
through
moulds
or
rusts
dor
drank
after
him
jak
cori
tasted
and
instantly
bade
her
children
drink
even
old
tama
drank
suspiciously
and
then
raised
her
voice
in
shrill
complaint
that
burl
had
not
led
them
to
this
place
sooner
tet
and
dik
became
convinced
that
there
were
no
deadly
things
lurking
in
it
and
splashed
each
other
dik
slipped
and
sat
down
hard
on
white
stuff
that
yielded
and
almost
splashed
he
got
up
and
looked
fearfully
at
what
he
thought
might
be
a
deadly
slime
then
he
yelped
shrilly
he
sat
down
on
and
crushed
part
of
a
bed
of
mushrooms
but
they
were
tiny
clean
and
appetizing
they
were
miniatures
of
the
edible
mushrooms
the
tribe
fed
on
burl
smelled
and
finally
tasted
one
it
was
of
course
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
perfectly
normal
edible
mushroom
growing
to
the
size
that
mushrooms
originally
grew
on
earth
it
grew
on
a
shaded
place
in
enormously
rich
soil
it
had
been
protected
from
direct
sunlight
by
trees
but
it
had
not
had
the
means
or
the
stimulus
to
become
a
monster
burl
ate
it
he
carefully
composed
his
features
then
he
announced
the
find
to
his
followers
there
was
food
here
he
told
them
sternly
but
in
this
splendid
world
to
which
he
had
led
them
food
was
small
there
would
be
no
great
enemies
here
but
the
food
would
have
to
be
sought
in
small
objects
instead
of
great
ones
they
must
look
at
this
place
and
seek
others
like
it
in
order
to
find
food
the
tribesmen
were
doubtful
but
they
plucked
mushrooms
whole
ones
instead
of
merely
breaking
off
parts
of
their
tops
with
deep
astonishment
they
recognized
the
miniature
objects
as
familiar
things
ensmalled
these
mushrooms
had
the
same
savor
but
they
were
not
coarse
or
stringy
or
tough
like
the
giants
they
melted
in
the
mouth
life
in
this
place
to
which
burl
had
led
them
was
delectable
truly
the
doings
of
burl
were
astonishing
when
the
oldest
of
cori
children
found
a
beetle
on
a
leaf
and
they
recognized
it
and
instead
of
being
bigger
than
a
man
and
a
thing
to
flee
from
it
was
less
than
an
inch
in
size
and
helpless
against
them
they
were
entranced
from
that
moment
onward
they
would
really
follow
burl
anywhere
in
the
happy
conviction
that
he
could
only
bring
good
to
everybody
the
opinion
could
have
drawbacks
and
it
need
not
be
always
even
true
but
burl
did
nothing
to
discourage
it
and
then
near
midday
they
made
a
discovery
even
greater
than
that
of
familiar
food
in
unfamiliar
sizes
they
were
struggling
at
the
time
through
a
vast
patch
of
bushes
with
thorns
on
them
they
were
not
used
to
thorns
which
they
deeply
distrusted
eventually
they
would
find
out
that
the
glistening
dark
fruit
were
blackberries
and
would
rejoice
in
them
but
at
this
first
encounter
they
were
uneasy
in
the
midst
of
such
an
untouched
they
heard
noises
in
the
distance
the
sound
was
made
up
of
cries
of
varying
pitch
some
of
which
were
loud
and
abrupt
and
others
longer
and
less
loud
the
people
did
not
understand
them
in
the
least
they
could
have
been
cries
of
human
beings
perhaps
but
they
were
not
cries
of
pain
also
they
were
not
language
they
seemed
to
express
a
tremendous
zestful
excitement
they
had
no
overtone
of
horror
and
burl
and
his
folk
had
known
of
no
excitement
among
insects
except
frenzy
they
could
not
imagine
what
sort
of
tumult
this
could
be
but
to
burl
these
sounds
had
something
of
the
timbre
of
the
yelping
noises
of
the
night
before
he
had
felt
drawn
to
that
sound
he
liked
it
he
liked
this
he
led
the
way
boldly
toward
the
agitated
noises
presently
after
a
mile
or
so
he
and
his
people
came
out
of
weeds
saya
was
immediately
behind
him
the
others
trailed
tama
complaining
bitterly
that
there
was
no
need
to
track
down
sounds
which
could
only
mean
danger
they
emerged
in
a
space
of
bare
stone
above
a
small
and
grassy
amphitheatre
the
tumult
came
from
its
center
a
pack
of
dogs
was
joyously
attacking
something
that
burl
could
not
see
clearly
they
were
dogs
they
barked
zestfully
and
they
yelped
and
snarled
and
yapped
in
a
dozen
different
voices
and
they
were
having
a
thoroughly
good
time
though
it
might
not
be
so
good
for
the
thing
they
attacked
one
of
them
sighted
the
humans
he
stopped
and
barked
the
others
whirled
and
saw
the
humans
as
they
came
out
into
view
the
tumult
ceased
abruptly
there
was
silence
the
tribesmen
saw
creatures
with
four
legs
only
they
had
never
before
seen
any
living
thing
with
fewer
than
six
except
men
spiders
had
eight
the
dogs
did
not
have
mandibles
they
did
not
have
they
did
not
act
like
insects
it
was
stupifying
and
the
dogs
saw
men
whom
they
had
never
seen
before
much
more
important
they
smelled
men
and
the
difference
between
and
was
so
vast
because
through
hundreds
of
generations
the
dogs
had
not
smelled
anything
with
warm
blood
save
their
own
kind
the
difference
in
smell
was
so
great
in
kind
that
the
dogs
did
not
react
with
suspicion
but
with
a
fascinated
curiosity
this
was
an
unparalleled
smell
it
was
even
in
its
novelty
an
overwhelmingly
satisfying
smell
the
dogs
regarded
the
men
with
their
heads
on
one
side
sniffing
in
the
deepest
possible
amazement
amazement
so
intense
that
they
could
not
possibly
feel
hostility
one
of
them
whined
a
little
because
he
did
not
understand
warm
blood
is
a
peculiarly
enough
it
was
a
matter
of
topography
the
plateau
which
reached
above
the
clouds
rose
with
a
steep
slope
from
the
valley
from
which
a
brood
had
driven
the
men
this
was
on
the
eastern
edge
of
the
plateau
on
the
west
however
the
highland
was
subject
to
an
indentation
which
almost
severed
it
no
more
than
twenty
miles
from
where
burl
group
had
climbed
to
sunshine
there
was
a
much
more
gradual
slope
downward
there
grew
almost
to
the
from
there
giant
insects
strayed
up
and
onto
the
plateau
itself
they
could
not
live
above
the
clouds
of
course
there
was
not
food
enough
for
their
insatiable
hunger
especially
at
night
it
was
too
cold
to
allow
them
to
stay
active
but
they
did
stray
from
their
normal
environment
and
some
of
them
did
reach
the
sunshine
and
perhaps
some
of
them
blundered
back
down
to
their
again
but
those
which
did
not
stumble
back
were
chilled
to
torpor
during
their
first
night
underneath
the
stars
they
were
only
partly
active
on
the
second
day
if
indeed
they
were
active
at
all
few
or
none
recovered
from
their
second
nights
coldness
none
at
all
kept
their
full
ferocity
and
deadliness
and
this
was
how
the
dogs
survived
they
were
certainly
descended
from
dogs
on
the
wrecked
the
whose
crew
had
landed
on
this
planet
some
human
generations
since
the
humans
of
today
had
no
memories
of
the
ship
and
the
dogs
surely
had
no
traditions
but
just
because
those
early
dogs
had
less
intelligence
they
had
more
useful
instincts
perhaps
the
first
generations
of
castaways
bred
dogs
in
their
first
few
desperate
centuries
hoping
that
dogs
could
help
them
survive
but
no
human
civilization
could
survive
in
the
lowlands
the
humans
went
back
to
the
primitive
state
of
their
race
and
lived
as
furtive
vermin
among
monsters
dogs
could
not
survive
there
though
humans
did
linger
on
so
somehow
the
dogs
took
to
the
heights
perhaps
dogs
survived
their
masters
perhaps
some
were
abandoned
or
driven
away
but
dogs
had
reached
the
highlands
and
they
did
survive
because
giant
insects
blundered
up
after
them
and
could
not
survive
in
a
proper
environment
for
dogs
and
men
there
was
even
reason
for
the
dogs
remaining
limited
in
number
and
keenly
intelligent
the
was
limited
when
there
were
too
many
dogs
their
attacks
on
stumbling
insect
giants
were
more
desperate
and
made
earlier
before
the
monsters
ferocity
was
lessened
so
more
dogs
died
then
there
was
an
adjustment
of
the
number
of
dogs
to
the
there
was
also
a
selection
of
those
too
intelligent
to
attack
rashly
yet
those
who
had
insufficient
courage
would
not
eat
in
short
the
dogs
who
now
regarded
men
with
bright
interested
eyes
were
very
sound
dogs
they
had
the
intelligence
needed
for
survival
they
did
not
attack
anything
imprudently
but
they
also
knew
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
more
than
reasonably
wary
of
insects
in
general
not
even
spiders
unless
they
were
very
newly
arrived
from
the
steaming
lowlands
so
the
dogs
regarded
men
with
very
much
the
same
astonished
interest
with
which
the
men
regarded
the
dogs
burl
saw
immediately
that
the
dogs
did
not
act
with
the
blind
ferocity
of
insects
but
with
an
interested
estimative
intelligence
strikingly
like
that
of
men
insects
never
examined
anything
they
fled
or
they
fought
those
who
were
not
carnivorous
had
no
interest
in
anything
but
food
and
those
who
were
lumbered
insanely
into
battle
at
the
bare
sight
of
possible
prey
the
dogs
did
neither
they
sniffed
and
they
considered
burl
said
sharply
to
his
followers
stay
here
he
walked
slowly
down
into
the
amphitheatre
saya
followed
him
instantly
dogs
moved
warily
aside
but
they
raised
their
noses
and
sniffed
they
were
long
luxurious
sniffs
the
smell
of
human
kind
was
a
good
smell
dogs
had
lived
hundreds
of
their
generations
without
having
it
in
their
nostrils
but
before
that
there
were
thousands
of
generations
to
whom
that
smell
was
a
necessity
burl
reached
the
object
the
dogs
had
been
attacking
it
lay
on
the
grass
throbbing
painfully
it
was
the
larva
of
an
moth
which
spread
wings
at
nightfall
the
time
for
its
metamorphosis
was
near
and
it
had
traveled
blindly
in
search
of
a
place
where
it
could
spin
its
cocoon
safely
and
change
to
its
winged
form
it
had
come
to
another
world
the
world
above
the
clouds
it
could
find
no
proper
place
its
stores
of
fat
had
protected
it
somewhat
from
the
chill
but
the
dogs
had
found
it
as
it
crawled
blindly
burl
considered
it
was
the
custom
of
wasps
to
sting
creatures
like
this
at
a
certain
special
spot
apparently
marked
for
them
by
a
tuft
of
dark
fur
burl
thrust
home
with
his
lance
the
point
pierced
that
particular
spot
the
creature
died
quickly
and
without
agony
the
thought
to
kill
was
an
inspiration
then
instinct
followed
burl
cut
off
meat
for
his
tribesmen
the
dogs
offered
no
objection
they
were
enough
burl
and
saya
together
carried
the
meat
back
to
the
other
tribesfolk
on
the
way
burl
passed
within
two
yards
of
a
dog
which
regarded
him
with
extreme
intentness
and
almost
a
wistful
expression
burl
smell
did
not
mean
game
it
meant
something
the
dog
struggled
helplessly
to
remember
but
it
was
good
i
have
killed
the
thing
said
burl
to
the
dog
in
the
tone
of
one
addressing
an
equal
you
can
go
and
eat
it
now
i
took
only
part
of
it
burl
and
his
people
ate
of
what
he
had
brought
back
many
of
the
dogs
most
of
them
went
to
the
feast
burl
had
left
presently
they
were
back
they
had
no
reason
to
be
hostile
they
were
fed
the
humans
offered
them
no
injury
and
the
humans
smelled
of
something
that
appealed
to
the
deepest
of
canine
nature
presently
the
dogs
were
close
about
the
humans
they
were
fascinated
and
the
humans
were
fascinated
in
return
each
of
the
people
had
a
little
of
the
feeling
that
burl
had
experienced
as
the
tribal
leader
in
the
intent
absorbed
and
wholly
unhostile
regard
of
the
dogs
even
children
felt
flattered
and
friendly
and
surely
in
a
place
where
everything
else
was
so
novel
and
so
satisfactory
it
was
possible
to
imagine
friendliness
with
creatures
which
were
not
human
since
assuredly
they
were
not
insects
a
similar
state
of
mind
existed
among
the
dogs
saya
had
more
meat
than
she
desired
she
glanced
among
the
members
of
the
tribe
all
were
supplied
she
tossed
it
to
a
dog
he
jerked
away
alertly
and
then
sniffed
at
it
where
it
had
dropped
a
dog
can
always
eat
he
ate
it
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
us
said
saya
hopefully
the
dog
wagged
his
tail
you
do
not
look
like
us
said
saya
interestedly
but
you
act
like
we
do
not
like
the
monsters
the
dog
looked
significantly
at
meat
in
burl
hand
burl
tossed
it
the
dog
caught
it
with
a
quick
snap
swallowed
it
wagged
his
tail
briefly
and
came
closer
it
was
a
completely
incredible
action
but
dogs
and
men
were
on
this
planet
besides
there
was
rightness
in
friendship
between
men
and
dogs
it
was
not
hindered
by
any
past
experience
of
either
they
were
the
only
creatures
on
this
world
it
was
a
kinship
felt
by
both
presently
burl
stood
up
and
spoke
politely
to
the
dog
he
addressed
him
with
the
same
respect
he
would
have
given
to
another
man
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
felt
equal
to
an
insect
but
he
felt
no
arrogance
toward
this
dog
he
felt
superior
only
to
other
men
we
are
going
back
to
our
cave
he
said
politely
maybe
we
will
meet
again
he
led
his
tribe
back
to
the
cave
in
which
they
had
spent
the
previous
night
the
dogs
followed
ranging
on
either
side
they
were
with
no
memory
of
hostility
to
any
creature
which
smelled
of
warm
blood
they
had
an
instinct
without
experience
to
dull
it
the
latter
part
of
the
journey
back
to
the
tribal
cave
was
if
anybody
had
been
qualified
to
notice
it
remarkably
like
a
group
of
dogs
taking
a
walk
with
a
group
of
people
it
was
companionable
it
felt
right
that
night
burl
left
the
cave
as
before
to
look
at
the
stars
this
time
saya
went
with
him
but
as
they
came
out
of
the
there
was
a
stirring
a
dog
rose
and
stretched
himself
elaborately
yawning
the
while
when
burl
and
saya
moved
away
he
trotted
amiably
with
them
they
talked
to
it
and
the
dog
seemed
pleased
it
wagged
its
tail
when
morning
came
the
dogs
were
still
waiting
hopefully
for
the
humans
to
come
out
they
appeared
to
expect
the
people
to
take
another
nice
long
walk
on
which
they
would
accompany
them
it
was
a
satisfaction
they
did
not
want
to
miss
after
all
from
a
standpoint
humans
are
made
to
take
long
walks
with
among
other
things
the
dogs
greeted
the
people
with
and
cordiality
the
dogs
made
a
great
difference
in
the
adjustment
of
the
tribe
to
life
upon
the
plateau
their
friendship
assured
the
new
status
of
human
life
burl
and
his
fellows
had
ceased
to
be
fugitive
game
for
any
insect
murderer
they
had
hoped
to
become
unpursued
foragers
because
they
could
hardly
imagine
anything
else
but
when
the
dogs
joined
them
they
were
immediately
raised
to
the
estate
of
hunters
the
men
did
not
domesticate
the
dogs
they
made
friends
with
them
the
dogs
did
not
subjugate
themselves
to
the
men
they
joined
them
at
first
tentatively
and
then
with
worshipful
enthusiasm
and
the
partnership
was
so
inevitably
a
right
one
that
within
a
month
it
was
as
if
it
had
always
been
actually
save
for
a
mere
two
thousand
years
it
had
been
at
the
end
of
a
month
the
tribe
had
a
permanent
encampment
there
were
caves
at
a
suitable
distance
from
the
slope
up
which
most
wanderers
from
the
lowlands
came
cori
oldest
child
found
the
chrysalis
of
a
giant
butterfly
whose
caterpillar
form
had
so
offensive
an
odor
that
the
dogs
had
not
attacked
it
but
when
it
emerged
from
the
chrysalis
men
and
dogs
together
assailed
it
before
it
could
take
flight
they
ended
the
enterprise
with
warm
mutual
approval
the
humans
had
acquired
great
wings
with
which
to
make
warm
cloaks
very
useful
against
the
evening
chill
dogs
and
men
alike
had
feasted
then
one
dawning
the
dogs
made
a
vast
outcry
which
awoke
the
tribesmen
burl
led
the
rush
to
the
spot
they
did
battle
with
a
monster
nocturnal
beetle
less
chilled
than
most
such
invaders
in
the
gray
dawnlight
burl
realized
that
the
darting
yapping
dogs
kept
the
creature
full
attention
he
crippled
and
then
killed
it
with
his
spear
the
feat
appeared
to
earn
him
warm
admiration
from
the
dogs
burl
wore
a
moth
feathery
antenna
again
bound
to
his
forehead
like
a
knight
plumes
he
looked
very
splendid
the
entire
pattern
of
human
life
changed
swiftly
as
if
an
entire
revelation
had
been
granted
to
men
the
ground
was
often
thorny
one
man
pierced
his
foot
old
tama
scolding
him
for
his
carelessness
bound
a
strip
of
about
it
so
he
could
walk
the
injured
foot
was
more
comfortable
than
the
one
still
unhurt
within
a
week
the
women
were
busily
contriving
diverse
forms
of
footgear
to
achieve
greater
comfort
for
everybody
one
day
saya
admired
glistening
red
berries
and
tried
to
pluck
one
and
they
stained
her
fingers
she
licked
her
fingers
to
clean
them
and
berries
were
added
to
the
tribe
menu
a
veritable
orgy
of
experiment
began
which
is
a
state
of
things
which
is
extremely
rare
in
human
affairs
a
race
with
an
established
culture
and
tradition
does
not
abandon
old
ways
of
doing
things
without
profound
reason
but
men
who
have
abandoned
their
old
ways
can
discover
astonishingly
useful
new
ones
already
the
dogs
were
established
as
sentries
and
watchmen
and
as
friends
to
every
member
of
the
tribe
by
now
mothers
did
not
feel
alarmed
if
a
child
wandered
out
of
sight
there
would
be
dogs
along
no
danger
could
approach
a
child
without
vociferous
warning
from
the
dogs
men
went
hunting
now
with
zestful
dogs
as
companions
in
the
chase
dor
killed
a
torpid
alone
save
for
assisting
dogs
and
burl
felt
a
twinge
of
jealousy
but
then
burl
himself
battled
a
black
male
spider
in
a
lone
duel
with
dogs
to
help
by
the
time
a
stray
monster
from
the
lowlands
reached
this
area
it
was
dazed
and
by
one
night
of
continuous
chill
even
the
black
spider
could
not
find
the
energy
to
leap
it
fought
like
a
fiend
yet
sluggishly
burl
killed
this
one
while
the
dogs
kept
it
busy
and
the
dogs
were
reproachful
because
he
carried
it
back
to
the
tribal
headquarters
before
dividing
it
among
his
assistants
afterward
he
realized
that
though
he
could
have
avoided
the
fight
he
would
have
been
ashamed
to
do
so
while
the
dogs
barked
and
snapped
at
its
furry
legs
it
was
while
things
were
in
this
state
that
the
way
of
life
for
human
beings
on
the
forgotten
planet
was
settled
for
all
time
burl
and
saya
went
out
early
one
morning
with
the
dogs
to
hunt
for
meat
for
the
village
hunting
was
easiest
in
the
early
hours
while
creatures
that
strayed
up
the
night
before
were
still
sluggish
with
cold
often
hunting
was
merely
butchery
of
an
enfeebled
monster
to
whom
any
effort
at
all
was
terribly
difficult
this
morning
they
strode
away
briskly
the
dogs
roved
exuberantly
through
the
brush
before
them
they
were
some
five
miles
from
the
village
when
the
dogs
bayed
game
and
burl
and
saya
ran
to
the
spot
with
ready
spears
which
was
something
of
a
change
from
their
former
actions
on
notice
of
a
carnivore
abroad
they
found
the
dogs
dancing
and
barking
around
one
of
the
most
ferocious
of
the
beetles
it
was
not
unduly
large
to
be
sure
its
body
might
have
been
four
feet
long
or
thereabouts
but
its
horrible
gaping
mandibles
added
a
good
three
feet
more
those
scythelike
weapons
gaped
wide
opening
sidewise
as
insects
jaws
do
as
the
beetle
snapped
hideously
at
its
attackers
swinging
about
as
the
dogs
dashed
at
it
its
legs
were
spurred
and
spiked
and
armed
with
spines
burl
plunged
into
the
fight
the
great
mandibles
clicked
and
clashed
they
were
capable
of
disemboweling
a
man
or
snapping
a
dog
body
in
half
without
effort
there
were
whistling
noises
as
the
beetle
breathed
through
its
abdominal
spiracles
it
fought
furiously
making
ferocious
charges
at
the
dogs
who
tormented
and
bewildered
it
but
they
created
the
most
zestfully
excited
of
tumults
burl
and
saya
were
of
course
at
least
as
absorbed
and
excited
as
the
dogs
or
they
would
have
noticed
the
thing
that
was
to
make
so
much
difference
to
every
human
being
not
only
on
the
plateau
but
still
down
in
the
lowlands
this
unnoticed
thing
was
beyond
their
imagining
there
had
been
nothing
else
like
it
on
this
world
in
many
hundreds
of
years
it
was
half
a
dozen
miles
away
and
perhaps
a
thousand
feet
high
when
burl
and
saya
prepared
to
intervene
professionally
on
behalf
of
the
dogs
it
was
a
silvery
needle
floating
unsupported
in
the
air
as
they
entered
the
battle
it
swerved
and
moved
swiftly
in
their
direction
it
was
silent
and
they
did
not
notice
they
knew
of
no
reason
to
scan
the
sky
in
daytime
and
there
was
business
on
hand
anyhow
burl
leaped
in
toward
the
beetle
with
a
at
the
tough
integument
where
an
armored
leg
joined
the
creature
body
he
missed
and
the
beetle
whirled
saya
flashed
her
cloak
before
the
monster
so
that
it
seemed
a
larger
and
a
nearer
antagonist
as
the
creature
whirled
again
burl
stabbed
and
a
crumpled
instantly
the
thing
was
limping
a
beetle
does
not
use
its
legs
like
creatures
a
beetle
moving
shifts
the
two
end
legs
on
one
side
and
the
central
leg
on
the
other
so
that
it
always
stands
on
an
adjustable
tripod
of
limbs
it
can
not
adjust
readily
to
crippling
a
dog
snatched
at
a
spiny
lower
leg
and
crunched
and
darted
away
the
monster
uttered
a
formless
cry
and
was
spurred
to
unbelievable
fierceness
the
fight
became
a
thing
of
furious
movement
and
joyous
uproar
with
burl
striking
once
at
a
multiple
eye
so
the
pain
would
deflect
it
from
a
charge
at
saya
and
saya
again
deflecting
it
with
her
cloak
and
once
breathlessly
trying
to
strike
it
with
her
shorter
spear
they
struck
it
again
and
a
third
time
and
it
sank
horribly
to
the
ground
all
three
legs
on
one
side
crippled
the
remaining
three
thrust
and
thrust
and
struggled
senselessly
and
suddenly
it
was
on
its
back
still
striking
its
gigantic
jaws
frantically
in
the
hope
of
murder
but
then
burl
struck
home
between
two
where
a
ganglion
was
almost
exposed
the
blow
killed
it
instantly
burl
and
saya
were
smiling
at
each
other
when
there
was
a
monstrous
sound
of
crashing
trees
they
whirled
the
dogs
pricked
up
their
ears
one
of
them
barked
defiantly
something
huge
truly
huge
had
settled
to
the
ground
a
bare
two
hundred
yards
away
it
was
metal
and
there
were
ports
in
its
sides
and
it
was
quite
beyond
imagining
because
of
course
no
had
landed
on
this
planet
in
human
generations
a
port
opened
as
they
stared
at
it
men
came
out
burl
and
saya
were
barbarically
attired
but
they
had
been
fighting
some
sort
of
local
monster
the
men
on
the
could
not
quite
grasp
what
they
had
seen
and
they
had
been
helped
by
dogs
human
beings
and
dogs
together
always
mean
some
sort
of
civilization
the
dogs
gave
an
impression
of
a
very
high
level
indeed
they
trotted
confidently
over
to
the
ship
and
they
sniffed
cautiously
at
the
men
who
had
landed
then
their
behavior
was
admirable
they
greeted
the
men
with
the
cordiality
of
dogs
who
are
on
the
best
possible
terms
with
human
beings
and
there
was
no
question
of
any
suspicion
by
anybody
the
attitude
of
a
man
toward
a
dog
is
a
perfectly
valid
indication
of
his
character
if
not
of
his
technical
education
and
the
newcomers
knew
how
to
treat
dogs
so
burl
and
saya
went
forward
with
the
confident
pleasure
with
which
children
and
other
persons
of
innate
dignity
greet
strangers
the
ship
was
the
a
private
cruiser
doing
incidental
exploration
for
the
biological
survey
in
the
course
of
a
trip
after
good
hunting
it
had
touched
on
the
forgotten
planet
and
it
would
never
be
forgotten
again
the
made
the
first
landing
on
the
forgotten
planet
and
the
followed
and
some
centuries
later
the
then
the
planet
was
forgotten
until
the
arrived
the
arrival
of
the
was
as
much
an
accident
as
the
loss
of
the
punched
card
which
caused
the
planet
to
be
overlooked
for
some
thousands
of
years
somebody
had
noticed
that
the
sun
around
which
it
circled
was
of
a
type
which
usually
has
useful
planets
but
there
was
no
record
that
it
had
ever
been
visited
so
a
request
to
the
sportsmen
on
the
had
caused
them
to
turn
aside
they
considered
anyhow
that
it
would
be
interesting
to
land
on
a
world
or
two
they
considered
it
fascinating
to
find
human
beings
there
before
them
but
they
could
not
understand
the
use
of
such
primitive
weapons
or
garments
of
such
barbaric
splendor
they
had
trouble
too
because
in
generations
the
speech
of
the
universe
had
changed
while
burl
and
saya
spoke
a
very
archaic
language
indeed
but
there
was
an
educator
on
the
it
was
quite
standard
apparatus
simply
for
a
human
child
so
that
could
be
begun
with
a
backlog
of
correct
speech
and
reading
with
the
practical
facts
of
mathematics
sanitation
and
the
general
information
that
any
human
being
anywhere
needs
to
know
children
use
it
before
they
start
school
and
they
absorb
its
information
quite
painlessly
it
is
rare
that
an
adult
needs
it
but
burl
and
saya
did
burl
was
politely
invited
to
wear
the
and
he
politely
obliged
he
found
himself
equipped
with
a
new
language
and
what
seemed
to
him
an
astonishing
amount
of
information
among
the
information
was
the
item
that
he
was
going
to
have
as
an
adult
a
severe
headache
which
he
did
also
included
was
the
fact
that
the
making
of
records
for
such
educators
was
so
laborious
a
process
that
it
took
generations
to
compile
one
for
the
instruments
burl
with
a
splitting
headache
nevertheless
urged
saya
to
join
him
in
getting
an
education
and
she
did
and
thereafter
they
were
able
to
converse
with
the
sportsmen
on
the
comfortably
enough
except
for
their
headaches
and
all
this
led
to
extremely
satisfactory
arrangements
sportsmen
could
not
but
be
enthusiastic
about
the
hunting
of
giant
insects
with
dogs
and
spears
the
sportsmen
on
the
wanted
some
of
that
kind
of
sport
burl
were
delighted
to
oblige
though
they
had
not
quite
the
zest
of
burl
they
had
to
acquire
educations
in
their
turn
so
they
could
talk
to
their
new
but
the
hunting
was
magnificent
the
abandoned
its
original
plans
and
settled
down
for
a
stay
presently
burl
casual
talk
of
the
lowlands
produced
results
an
came
out
of
the
ship
and
through
the
educator
burl
was
now
a
civilized
man
he
had
not
the
specialized
later
information
of
his
guests
but
he
had
knowledge
they
could
not
dream
of
and
which
it
would
take
much
of
a
century
to
put
in
recordable
form
for
an
educator
so
an
went
down
into
the
lowlands
through
the
there
were
three
men
on
board
they
had
good
hunting
magnificent
hunting
even
more
importantly
they
found
another
cluster
of
human
beings
who
lived
as
fugitives
among
the
insect
giants
they
brought
them
to
the
plateau
a
few
at
a
time
sportsmen
stayed
in
the
lowlands
with
modern
weapons
hunting
enthusiastically
while
the
transfer
took
place
in
all
the
stayed
for
two
months
when
it
left
its
sportsmen
had
such
trophies
as
would
make
them
envied
of
all
other
hunters
in
three
they
left
behind
weapons
and
and
their
library
and
tools
but
they
took
with
them
enthusiasm
for
the
sport
on
the
planet
and
rather
warm
feelings
of
friendship
for
burl
they
sent
their
friends
back
the
next
ship
to
come
in
found
a
small
city
on
the
plateau
with
a
population
of
three
hundred
souls
all
civilized
by
educator
naturally
they
had
no
trouble
building
civilized
dwellings
or
practising
sanitation
or
developing
a
neatly
adapted
for
their
particular
environment
this
second
ship
brought
more
weapons
and
fliers
and
news
from
the
first
party
about
commercial
demand
for
the
incredibly
luxurious
to
be
found
on
only
one
planet
in
all
the
galaxy
the
fourth
ship
to
land
on
the
plateau
was
a
anxious
to
load
such
furs
for
recklessly
bidding
merchants
in
a
dozen
interplanetary
marts
there
were
then
nearly
a
thousand
people
living
on
the
plateau
they
had
a
natural
monopoly
not
of
and
fabric
and
panels
of
irridescent
chitin
for
luxurious
decoration
but
of
the
strictly
practical
and
detailed
knowledge
of
which
made
it
possible
to
obtain
them
visitors
who
tried
to
hunt
without
local
knowledge
did
not
come
back
from
the
lowlands
in
time
burl
firmly
enacted
a
planetary
law
which
forbade
the
inexperienced
to
go
below
the
because
of
course
a
government
had
to
be
formed
for
the
planet
but
men
with
the
basic
education
of
citizens
everywhere
did
not
fumble
it
they
had
a
job
to
do
which
was
more
important
than
anybody
vanity
it
was
a
job
which
gave
deep
and
abiding
satisfaction
when
naked
trembling
folk
were
found
in
the
and
brought
to
the
plateau
they
had
one
instant
feverish
desire
as
soon
as
they
got
over
the
headache
from
the
educator
they
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
lowlands
it
was
profitable
to
be
sure
but
it
was
even
more
of
a
satisfaction
to
hunt
and
kill
the
monsters
that
had
hunted
and
killed
men
for
so
long
it
felt
good
too
to
find
other
humans
and
bring
them
out
to
sunshine
so
nowadays
the
forgotten
planet
has
ceased
to
be
forgotten
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
name
it
because
its
name
is
known
through
all
the
galaxy
its
population
is
not
large
so
far
but
it
is
an
interesting
place
to
live
in
in
the
popular
mind
it
is
the
most
glamorous
of
all
possible
worlds
and
for
easily
understandable
reasons
the
inhabitants
of
its
capital
city
wear
garments
and
cloaks
for
the
benefit
of
their
fellows
in
the
lowlands
there
is
no
day
but
fliers
take
off
and
dive
down
into
the
mists
when
human
hunters
are
in
the
lowlands
they
dress
as
the
lowlanders
they
used
to
be
so
that
lowlanders
who
may
spy
them
will
be
sure
that
they
are
men
and
friends
and
come
to
them
to
be
raised
to
proper
dignity
above
the
insects
it
is
not
unusual
for
a
man
to
be
brought
up
to
sunshine
and
have
his
session
with
the
educator
and
be
flying
his
own
assigned
within
a
week
diving
back
above
what
used
to
be
the
place
where
he
was
hunted
but
where
he
has
become
the
hunter
it
is
a
very
pleasant
arrangement
the
search
for
more
humans
in
the
lowlands
is
a
prosperous
business
even
when
it
is
unsuccessful
the
wings
of
white
morpho
butterflies
bring
the
highest
prices
but
even
a
common
is
riches
and
the
fur
of
caterpillars
duly
processed
goes
into
the
holds
of
the
ships
with
the
care
given
elsewhere
to
platinum
and
diamonds
and
also
it
is
good
sport
the
planet
is
a
sportsman
paradise
there
are
not
too
many
visitors
nobody
may
go
hunting
without
an
experienced
host
and
sportsmen
tend
to
feel
somewhat
queasy
after
a
session
as
guest
of
the
folk
who
have
made
burl
their
visitors
are
not
so
much
alarmed
at
fighting
flying
beetles
in
even
though
the
beetles
may
compare
with
the
hunters
craft
in
size
and
are
terrifically
tenacious
of
life
the
thing
that
appalls
strangers
is
the
insistence
of
burl
no
longer
only
tribesmen
upon
fighting
spiders
on
the
ground
with
their
memories
they
like
it
that
way
it
more
satisfactory
not
long
ago
the
planet
president
of
sumor
xi
was
burl
guest
for
a
hunt
sumor
xi
is
a
highly
civilized
planet
and
life
there
has
become
tame
its
president
is
an
ardent
hunter
he
liked
burl
who
is
still
all
hard
muscle
despite
his
graying
hair
he
and
saya
have
a
very
comfortable
dwelling
and
now
that
their
children
are
grown
they
have
room
in
it
even
for
a
planet
president
if
he
comes
as
a
sportsman
guest
the
planet
president
of
sumor
xi
even
liked
the
informal
atmosphere
of
a
house
where
pleasantly
dogs
curl
up
comfortably
on
rugs
of
down
that
elsewhere
are
beyond
price
but
the
president
of
sumor
xi
was
embarrassed
on
his
visit
he
and
burl
are
both
hunters
and
they
are
highly
congenial
but
the
president
of
sumor
xi
was
upset
on
his
last
flight
to
the
lowlands
burl
got
out
of
the
alone
and
for
pure
deep
personal
satisfaction
he
fought
a
wolf
spider
with
nothing
but
a
spear
he
killed
the
creature
of
course
but
the
president
of
sumor
xi
was
embarrassed
he
would
have
dared
try
it
he
felt
that
however
sporting
it
might
be
it
was
too
risky
a
thing
for
a
planet
president
to
do
but
saya
took
it
for
granted
