preface
there
is
a
power
lying
hidden
in
man
by
the
use
of
which
he
can
rise
to
higher
and
better
things
there
is
in
man
a
greater
self
that
transcends
the
finite
self
of
the
even
as
the
mountain
towers
above
the
plain
the
object
of
this
little
book
is
to
help
men
and
women
to
bring
their
inward
powers
of
mind
and
spirit
into
expression
wisely
and
in
harmony
with
universal
law
to
build
up
character
and
to
find
within
themselves
that
wondrous
self
which
is
their
real
self
and
which
when
found
reveals
to
them
that
they
are
literally
and
truly
sons
of
god
and
daughters
of
the
most
high
there
is
no
way
whereby
the
discipline
of
life
can
be
avoided
there
is
no
means
by
which
fate
can
be
tricked
nor
cunning
device
by
which
the
great
cosmic
plan
can
be
evaded
each
life
must
meet
its
own
troubles
and
difficulties
each
soul
must
pass
through
its
deep
waters
every
heart
must
encounter
sorrow
and
grief
but
none
need
be
overwhelmed
in
the
great
conflicts
of
life
for
one
who
has
learned
the
great
secret
of
his
identity
with
the
universal
life
and
power
dwells
in
an
impregnable
city
built
upon
and
into
the
rock
of
truth
against
which
the
storms
of
life
beat
in
vain
while
this
little
work
does
not
offer
any
vain
promises
of
an
easy
life
for
if
this
were
possible
it
would
be
the
greatest
of
all
disasters
but
rather
endeavours
to
show
how
to
become
so
strong
that
life
looks
almost
easy
by
comparison
the
life
or
fate
does
not
change
or
become
easier
but
the
individual
alters
and
becomes
stronger
yet
it
does
show
the
reader
how
to
avoid
making
his
life
more
difficult
than
it
need
be
most
people
lives
would
be
less
filled
with
trouble
and
suffering
if
they
took
life
in
the
right
spirit
and
acted
in
harmony
with
universal
law
it
is
hoped
that
this
little
book
may
help
many
to
come
into
harmony
with
life
law
and
purpose
and
thus
avoid
much
needless
suffering
to
find
the
greater
self
within
which
discovery
brings
with
it
a
realization
of
absolute
security
to
bring
into
expression
and
wisely
use
their
inner
spiritual
and
mental
forces
and
thus
enter
a
life
of
overcoming
and
almost
boundless
power
chapter
infinite
life
and
power
man
possesses
did
he
but
know
it
illimitable
power
this
power
is
of
the
spirit
therefore
it
is
unconquerable
it
is
not
the
power
of
the
ordinary
life
or
finite
will
or
human
mind
it
transcends
these
because
being
spiritual
it
is
of
a
higher
order
than
either
physical
or
even
mental
this
power
lies
dormant
and
is
hidden
within
man
until
he
is
sufficiently
evolved
and
unfolded
to
be
entrusted
with
its
use
the
powers
of
the
mind
are
dealt
with
in
other
chapters
the
powers
of
the
spirit
are
far
greater
and
finer
than
those
of
the
mind
thought
is
a
spiritual
power
of
tremendous
potency
but
this
is
not
the
power
of
which
we
speak
by
thought
man
can
either
raise
himself
up
and
connect
himself
with
the
power
house
of
the
universe
or
cut
himself
off
entirely
from
the
divine
inflow
his
thought
is
his
greatest
weapon
because
by
it
he
can
either
draw
on
the
infinite
or
sever
himself
in
consciousness
but
not
in
reality
from
his
divine
source
through
the
divine
spark
within
him
which
is
really
his
real
self
man
is
connected
with
the
infinite
divine
life
and
power
are
his
if
he
that
they
are
his
so
long
as
he
is
ignorant
of
his
oneness
with
the
divine
source
of
all
life
he
is
incapable
of
appropriating
the
power
that
is
really
his
if
however
he
enters
into
this
inner
knowledge
he
finds
himself
the
possessor
of
infinite
power
and
unlimited
resources
this
power
then
is
god
yet
it
is
also
man
but
it
is
not
revealed
to
him
until
he
is
fit
to
be
entrusted
with
it
it
is
only
when
man
realizes
his
oneness
with
his
divine
source
that
he
becomes
filled
with
its
power
many
teachers
and
initiates
lament
the
fact
that
certain
secrets
are
being
spread
broadcast
secrets
that
in
the
past
were
kept
closely
guarded
they
fear
that
unillumined
and
people
may
make
destructive
use
of
spiritual
power
this
to
the
writer
appears
to
be
improbable
it
is
true
that
strong
personalities
who
have
a
great
belief
in
their
own
power
to
achieve
and
succeed
draw
unconsciously
on
hidden
powers
and
thus
are
able
to
raise
themselves
high
above
their
fellows
the
use
however
that
they
can
make
of
spiritual
power
for
base
purposes
is
limited
and
is
not
to
be
feared
there
are
others
of
course
who
are
misusing
their
powers
these
are
black
magicians
and
while
they
may
do
a
certain
amount
of
harm
they
become
reduced
ultimately
to
beggary
and
impotence
there
are
also
others
who
spend
the
whole
of
their
spare
time
searching
for
knowledge
of
this
very
subject
they
read
every
occult
book
they
can
lay
hands
on
but
they
never
find
that
for
which
they
seek
there
are
spiritual
powers
and
influences
that
withhold
the
eyes
of
the
seekers
from
seeing
until
they
are
ready
for
the
revelation
when
man
in
his
search
for
truth
has
given
up
all
selfish
striving
after
unworthy
things
and
has
ceased
to
use
his
in
conflict
with
the
greater
will
of
the
whole
he
is
ready
for
the
revelation
of
his
oneness
with
the
infinite
yielding
implicitly
to
the
will
of
the
whole
may
seem
to
the
unillumined
an
act
of
weakness
yet
it
is
the
entrance
to
a
life
of
almost
boundless
power
man
is
not
separate
from
his
divine
source
and
never
has
been
he
is
in
reality
one
with
the
infinite
the
separation
which
he
feels
and
experiences
is
mental
and
is
due
to
his
blindness
and
unbelief
man
can
never
be
separated
from
spirit
for
he
himself
is
spirit
he
is
an
integral
part
of
one
complete
whole
he
lives
and
moves
and
has
his
being
in
god
universal
omnipresent
spirit
and
god
spirit
dwells
in
him
the
majority
of
people
are
unaware
of
this
intimate
relationship
with
the
divine
and
because
they
are
unaware
or
because
they
refuse
to
believe
it
they
are
in
one
sense
separated
from
the
inner
life
of
god
yet
this
separation
is
only
in
their
thoughts
and
beliefs
and
not
in
reality
man
is
not
separated
and
never
can
be
yet
so
long
as
he
believes
that
he
is
separate
and
alone
he
will
be
as
weak
and
helpless
as
though
he
actually
were
as
soon
as
man
realizes
the
truth
of
his
relationship
to
the
infinite
he
passes
from
weakness
to
power
from
death
unto
life
one
moment
he
is
in
the
desert
afar
off
weak
separate
and
alone
the
next
he
realizes
that
he
is
nothing
less
than
a
son
of
god
with
all
a
son
privileges
and
powers
he
realizes
in
a
flash
that
he
is
one
with
his
divine
source
and
that
he
can
never
be
separated
he
awakens
also
to
the
fact
that
all
the
power
of
the
infinite
is
his
to
draw
upon
that
he
can
never
really
fail
that
he
is
marching
on
to
victory
it
will
thus
be
seen
how
great
is
the
power
of
man
thought
while
thought
is
not
the
power
of
the
spirit
it
is
the
power
by
which
man
either
connects
himself
up
with
the
infinite
power
opening
himself
to
the
divine
inflow
or
cuts
himself
off
and
separates
himself
from
his
spiritual
source
thus
in
a
sense
man
is
what
he
thinks
he
is
if
he
thinks
he
is
separate
from
god
and
cut
off
from
his
power
then
it
is
as
though
this
were
really
the
case
and
he
is
just
as
impotent
and
miserable
as
though
he
actually
existed
apart
from
god
on
the
other
hand
if
he
thinks
and
believes
that
he
is
one
with
the
infinite
he
finds
that
it
is
gloriously
true
and
that
he
is
really
a
son
of
god
if
he
believes
and
thinks
that
he
is
a
mere
material
being
then
he
lives
the
limited
life
of
a
material
being
and
is
never
able
to
rise
above
it
but
if
on
the
contrary
he
thinks
and
believes
that
he
is
a
spiritual
being
then
he
finds
that
he
possesses
all
the
powers
of
a
spiritual
being
again
if
he
thinks
that
his
work
is
difficult
and
that
he
is
not
equal
to
his
tasks
he
finds
that
really
his
tasks
are
difficult
and
beyond
his
powers
yet
on
the
other
hand
if
he
believes
his
work
is
easy
or
at
any
rate
within
his
powers
he
finds
that
such
is
the
case
and
that
he
can
do
his
work
with
ease
the
power
within
is
infinite
for
by
faith
in
it
man
is
directly
coupled
up
with
the
spiritual
power
of
the
universe
the
divine
spark
within
him
connects
him
to
the
sacred
flame
thus
making
him
potentially
a
god
in
the
making
a
change
then
must
take
place
within
man
before
he
can
enter
into
his
divine
inheritance
he
must
learn
to
think
after
the
spirit
as
a
spiritual
being
instead
of
after
the
flesh
as
a
material
creature
like
the
prodigal
son
he
must
come
to
himself
and
leave
the
husks
and
the
swine
in
the
far
country
returning
to
his
father
house
where
there
is
bread
of
life
enough
and
to
spare
chapter
ii
the
overcoming
of
life
difficulties
the
true
object
of
life
is
that
man
may
attain
wisdom
through
experience
this
can
not
be
accomplished
by
giving
in
to
the
difficulties
of
life
but
only
by
overcoming
them
the
promises
of
god
are
not
made
to
those
who
fail
in
life
battle
but
to
those
who
neither
are
there
any
promises
that
man
shall
have
an
easy
time
and
be
happy
ever
afterwards
yet
it
is
after
this
that
the
majority
of
people
are
for
ever
seeking
an
easy
life
a
good
time
freedom
from
suffering
and
care
but
in
spite
of
all
their
seeking
they
can
never
find
that
which
they
desire
there
is
always
a
fly
in
the
ointment
of
their
pleasure
something
that
robs
them
of
true
happiness
or
possibly
combinations
of
circumstances
conspire
to
upset
all
their
plans
life
is
a
paradox
the
true
object
of
life
is
not
the
attainment
of
happiness
yet
if
we
attain
the
true
object
of
life
we
find
happiness
those
who
are
ignorant
of
life
true
purpose
and
who
seek
happiness
high
and
low
year
after
year
fail
to
find
it
like
a
it
for
ever
eludes
them
on
the
other
hand
those
who
recognize
the
true
object
of
life
and
follow
it
attain
happiness
without
seeking
for
it
in
times
past
people
have
made
god
a
convenience
they
have
thought
they
could
drift
through
life
learning
none
of
its
discipline
and
then
when
in
trouble
or
things
were
not
to
their
liking
they
could
pray
to
god
and
have
the
unpleasant
circumstances
taken
away
the
same
idea
is
prevalent
people
have
left
the
old
orthodoxy
and
look
to
various
cults
and
isms
to
get
them
out
of
their
difficulties
they
do
not
believe
now
that
they
can
curry
special
favour
with
god
by
prayer
but
they
firmly
believe
that
they
can
get
what
they
want
from
the
invisible
by
demanding
it
they
think
that
by
this
means
they
can
have
their
own
way
after
all
by
this
they
mean
having
a
good
time
with
no
unpleasant
experiences
trials
difficulties
adversities
they
are
however
merely
chasing
rainbows
the
easy
life
they
seek
constantly
eludes
them
simply
because
there
is
no
such
thing
the
only
life
that
is
easy
is
the
life
of
the
strong
soul
who
has
overcome
his
life
is
not
easy
in
reality
but
appears
relatively
so
because
of
his
strength
it
is
impossible
to
have
an
easy
life
and
if
it
were
possible
then
life
would
be
not
worth
living
for
the
sole
object
of
life
is
the
building
of
character
and
the
attainment
of
wisdom
through
experience
life
to
all
of
us
must
always
be
full
of
difficulty
and
it
is
to
help
those
who
hitherto
have
found
life
rather
too
much
for
them
that
this
book
is
being
written
what
the
majority
are
seeking
for
is
an
easy
life
which
they
will
never
find
but
precisely
the
reverse
and
for
them
i
have
no
message
but
to
those
wise
and
awakened
souls
who
are
seeking
for
truth
no
matter
from
whence
it
may
come
and
who
desire
to
overcome
life
and
its
difficulties
instead
of
weakly
giving
in
to
them
this
book
it
is
hoped
will
bring
a
message
at
this
stage
we
can
not
go
into
the
subject
of
why
we
should
meet
with
disasters
and
adversity
in
this
life
nor
why
some
people
should
have
apparently
a
smoother
life
than
others
we
must
therefore
be
satisfied
to
know
that
we
have
to
meet
trouble
and
overcome
difficulty
and
that
it
is
only
by
so
doing
that
we
can
attain
wisdom
and
build
up
character
the
question
then
is
not
we
shall
meet
the
trouble
and
adversity
or
not
but
rather
we
shall
meet
them
shall
we
be
victorious
or
shall
we
be
submerged
shall
we
overcome
life
difficulties
or
shall
we
give
in
to
them
this
subject
is
dealt
with
in
the
path
of
victory
by
the
same
author
and
published
by
the
science
of
thought
press
the
majority
of
people
are
drifters
on
the
sea
of
life
they
are
wafted
here
and
blown
there
they
are
also
carried
hither
and
thither
by
every
current
it
is
only
the
few
who
realize
that
they
have
the
power
of
the
infinite
within
them
by
which
they
can
rise
superior
to
all
their
difficulties
overcome
their
own
weaknesses
and
through
victorious
experience
attain
wisdom
at
this
point
some
practical
reader
may
say
that
attaining
wisdom
is
all
very
well
but
what
he
wants
is
practical
help
he
is
perhaps
out
of
work
has
sickness
in
his
house
and
is
in
debt
or
he
may
be
and
yet
in
the
deepest
distress
and
misery
to
all
such
i
would
say
that
they
possess
the
power
by
which
they
can
overcome
all
their
difficulties
and
through
overcoming
attain
wisdom
a
man
success
depends
more
than
anything
upon
his
faith
his
faith
in
the
good
purpose
of
life
his
faith
in
the
power
of
the
infinite
within
him
and
his
ability
to
overcome
every
obstacle
in
his
path
the
extent
of
the
power
that
man
can
bring
into
his
life
is
the
measure
of
his
faith
in
that
power
if
his
faith
in
it
is
small
then
his
life
will
be
feeble
and
lacking
in
achievement
if
his
faith
in
the
power
within
him
is
large
then
great
will
be
the
power
manifesting
in
his
life
the
power
of
the
infinite
is
illimitable
and
inexhaustible
all
that
is
required
is
an
unquenchable
belief
and
trust
in
it
the
weakest
and
most
timid
can
make
use
of
this
power
there
is
the
same
power
in
the
timid
and
weak
as
in
the
brave
and
strong
the
weakness
of
the
former
is
due
to
a
lack
of
faith
and
belief
in
the
infinite
power
within
them
difficulties
and
troubles
there
will
be
in
every
life
and
sometimes
disaster
and
heartbreak
when
the
very
earth
slides
from
under
the
feet
yet
by
calling
upon
the
power
within
it
is
possible
to
rise
from
the
ruins
of
cherished
hopes
stronger
and
greater
through
experience
happiness
and
true
success
depend
upon
how
the
troubles
and
difficulties
of
life
are
met
adversity
comes
to
all
but
if
it
is
met
in
the
right
manner
even
failure
can
be
made
the
to
success
trouble
comes
to
all
but
while
it
makes
some
people
stronger
and
better
in
every
way
it
submerges
others
so
that
they
never
rise
again
the
trouble
is
the
same
it
is
how
it
is
met
that
makes
the
difference
those
who
meet
difficulty
and
adversity
in
the
feeble
strength
of
their
finite
minds
and
false
personality
are
speedily
overwhelmed
and
broken
by
the
storms
of
life
but
those
who
rely
upon
and
have
faith
in
the
power
within
them
can
never
be
overwhelmed
neither
can
they
ever
be
defeated
the
power
being
infinite
is
always
sufficient
no
matter
how
great
the
need
may
be
one
who
realizes
his
own
real
spiritual
identity
knows
that
he
can
never
die
that
he
can
never
be
defeated
that
he
can
never
really
fail
he
may
lose
his
body
through
the
change
that
is
called
death
but
he
the
true
man
can
never
die
neither
can
he
fail
though
he
be
defeated
a
thousand
times
he
rise
again
only
have
faith
in
the
spiritual
power
within
you
and
you
can
know
all
the
joys
of
overcoming
and
achievement
all
things
will
become
yours
seek
first
the
kingdom
within
you
your
spiritual
union
with
the
infinite
and
harmony
with
the
divine

and

and
all
these
things
shall
be

unto

chapter
iii
fate
or
great
has
been
the
controversy
in
the
past
over
the
vexed
subject
of
fate
versus
on
the
one
hand
fatalists
claim
that
man
is
so
closely
bound
to
the
wheel
of
fate
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
live
his
life
in
any
different
way
than
that
which
is
mapped
out
for
him
he
can
bring
a
quantity
of
evidence
in
support
of
his
claim
and
believes
in
his
theory
with
all
his
heart
on
the
other
hand
the
advocate
of
believes
just
as
that
man
is
not
bound
at
all
being
as
free
as
air
he
too
can
bring
plenty
of
evidence
in
support
of
his
theory
which
confirms
him
in
his
belief
each
one
of
them
thinks
that
the
other
is
wrong
yet
they
can
not
both
be
wrong
let
us
therefore
examine
the
subject
for
ourselves
for
it
is
an
important
one
being
intimately
connected
with
the
subject
which
this
book
discusses
first
of
all
let
it
be
said
they
are
both
wrong
in
part
and
right
in
part
man
is
bound
to
the
wheel
yet
at
the
same
time
he
has
let
us
therefore
explain
this
seeming
paradox
it
is
an
ancient
truth
of
the
inner
teaching
that
man
when
he
is
unevolved
and
before
he
is
unfolded
is
bound
to
the
wheel
of
fate
very
closely
the
unevolved
man
follows
his
desires
thus
creating
for
himself
a
future
from
which
he
can
not
escape
when
however
he
becomes
more
evolved
and
emancipated
he
begins
to
resist
following
his
desires
and
strives
instead
to
follow
higher
things
this
creates
for
him
a
better
future
and
thus
he
becomes
free
in
comparison
with
his
former
slave
state
man
is
a
slave
to
fate
as
long
as
he
is
a
slave
to
the
desires
of
the
earth
plane
he
is
however
free
to
overcome
lower
things
and
thus
rise
to
higher
when
he
does
this
he
ceases
to
create
a
painful
future
for
himself
and
thus
becomes
free
there
is
therefore
fate
which
is
self
created
it
is
necessary
to
acknowledge
this
before
we
can
proceed
further
one
who
has
not
had
much
experience
of
life
or
who
has
not
been
a
close
observer
may
deny
that
there
is
such
a
thing
but
one
who
has
had
great
changes
in
his
life
against
which
he
has
fought
and
struggled
in
vain
knows
that
there
is
a
purpose
working
behind
the
events
of
life
against
which
even
kings
and
mighty
men
are
powerless
there
come
times
in
man
life
when
he
moves
heaven
and
earth
figuratively
speaking
prays
until
he
can
pray
no
more
sacrifices
it
may
be
his
money
his
health
his
prospects
and
does
everything
that
is
in
the
power
of
a
human
being
in
a
vain
attempt
to
stave
off
a
threatened
disaster
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
in
spite
of
his
cries
to
a
pitiless
heaven
the
relentless
march
of
fate
can
not
be
stayed
it
moves
forward
like
a
huge
juggernaut
and
crushes
his
hopes
his
dearest
idol
his
very
life
itself
or
all
that
then
makes
his
life
worth
living
and
leaves
him
desolate
if
then
you
may
ask
fate
is
so
pitiless
and
so
powerful
what
can
be
done
with
it
and
where
does
enter
into
the
matter
in
reply
it
must
be
admitted
at
once
that
it
is
no
use
fighting
fate
the
more
man
fights
it
the
more
completely
he
gets
broken
there
are
certain
main
events
in
each
life
which
must
come
to
pass
these
events
and
changes
are
inevitable
and
it
is
hopeless
to
fight
against
them
while
these
things
which
constitute
what
we
call
fate
are
inevitable
and
therefore
can
not
be
avoided
it
rests
with
ourselves
how
we
meet
these
adversities
and
disasters
if
we
meet
them
in
the
wrong
way
they
break
us
if
however
we
meet
them
in
the
right
way
we
become
stronger
through
discipline
and
experience
thus
becoming
better
fitted
to
bear
life
responsibilities
and
to
overcome
its
difficulties
and
temptations
one
who
meets
the
setbacks
griefs
bereavements
and
disasters
of
life
in
the
right
spirit
becomes
a
strong
and
rich
character
he
becomes
mellowed
through
experience
strong
stable
a
helpful
influence
to
all
who
meet
him
when
things
go
smoothly
and
life
is
a
merry
round
no
philosophy
or
religion
seems
necessary
and
as
for
an
inward
power
what
of
it
we
can
do
very
well
without
it
so
say
the
thoughtless
and
inexperienced
but
there
come
times
in
every
life
when
not
only
is
a
philosophy
and
that
a
very
sound
one
necessary
but
also
a
power
of
which
the
finite
self
knows
nothing
is
needed
in
order
to
raise
the
soul
out
of
the
dust
and
ashes
of
its
despair
it
is
one
thing
to
try
and
meet
trouble
and
adversity
in
the
right
spirit
and
quite
another
thing
to
have
the
power
to
do
so
one
who
thinks
that
he
has
no
power
within
him
but
that
all
the
power
is
in
circumstances
can
never
rise
victorious
over
his
troubles
and
become
a
conqueror
over
life
difficulties
but
one
who
realizes
that
he
possesses
a
wonderful
power
that
can
raise
him
up
no
matter
how
crushed
he
may
be
can
never
be
a
failure
in
life
no
matter
what
may
happen
to
him
he
will
play
the
man
and
act
a
noble
part
he
will
rise
from
the
ruins
of
his
life
and
build
it
anew
in
greater
beauty
and
splendour
at
this
stage
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
difference
between
big
fate
and
the
circumstances
of
life
big
fate
as
it
sometimes
is
called
antedates
this
present
life
and
its
cause
does
not
come
within
the
scope
of
this
little
book
sufficient
if
we
say
here
that
through
the
ages
we
reap
as
we
sow
therefore
our
future
depends
upon
how
we
meet
life
and
its
difficulties
big
fate
then
can
not
be
successfully
fought
simply
because
it
is
the
working
of
omnipotent
law
but
our
life
generally
and
its
circumstances
depend
upon
how
we
meet
big
fate
and
how
we
recover
from
it
no
matter
how
seemingly
unkind
fate
may
be
it
is
possible
for
us
to
make
our
life
a
beautiful
thing
inspired
and
energized
by
the
power
within
we
can
rise
from
the
ashes
of
our
dead
hopes
to
build
anew
our
life
in
greater
beauty
and
more
in
harmony
with
the
divine
ideal
in
addition
to
the
fate
or
future
which
every
thought
and
action
builds
there
is
behind
all
evolution
a
gigantic
plan
this
wonderful
plan
that
embraces
all
from
the
stupendous
conception
of
a
limitless
universe
down
to
the
smallest
electron
is
being
worked
out
through
the
ages
with
absolute
precision
nothing
can
prevent
this
plan
from
being
brought
into
manifestation
it
gathers
up
our
past
and
weaves
it
into
our
present
life
just
in
the
same
way
that
it
is
busily
gathering
up
our
present
life
and
weaving
it
into
future
fate
it
works
it
all
into
the
big
plan
somehow
and
with
infinite
skill
the
plan
is
bound
to
be
followed
this
too
is
fate
but
how
we
follow
it
either
with
willingness
and
happiness
or
opposition
or
woe
rests
with
us
this
is
free
will
those
who
have
studied
the
occult
sciences
may
say
what
about
planetary
influences
they
will
point
out
that
according
to
the
ancient
science
of
astrology
a
man
life
is
determined
by
the
star
under
which
he
is
born
this
is
true
if
he
gives
in
to
the
influences
around
his
path
at
different
times
in
his
life
man
meets
with
influences
that
are
sometimes
favourable
and
at
other
times
adverse
these
influences
are
however
only
influences
after
all
and
one
who
will
stand
firm
during
periods
of
adversity
and
refuse
to
give
in
relying
upon
the
great
power
within
to
carry
him
through
will
find
that
he
can
weather
all
storms
of
life
and
come
out
of
his
trials
greatly
strengthened
he
can
not
prevent
these
influences
from
coming
around
his
path
of
life
but
he
can
rise
superior
to
them
he
will
meet
with
failures
and
but
he
will
make
of
these
to
success
he
will
experience
griefs
and
bereavements
but
out
of
these
he
will
build
a
finer
character
and
rise
to
higher
things
one
however
who
gives
in
to
these
things
refusing
to
rise
again
and
reconstruct
his
life
condemns
himself
to
further
suffering
thus
making
utter
shipwreck
of
his
life
let
the
despairing
take
heart
again
believe
in
the
power
within
you
and
you
will
rise
to
heights
before
undreamed
of
with
this
power
to
help
you
you
can
accomplish
the
apparently
impossible
appendix
to
chapter
iii
our
life
here
is
not
governed
by
a
capricious
being
who
blows
first
hot
and
then
cold
or
who
favours
one
person
and
tortures
another
the
supreme
being
works
through
laws
that
are
absolutely
just
and
unchanging
therefore
all
disaster
and
trouble
in
the
life
is
the
effect
of
certain
causes
these
causes
are
our
own
wrong
doing
in
the
past
which
set
in
motion
forces
against
which
the
power
and
wit
and
wisdom
of
man
are
powerless
however
because
the
fundamental
law
of
the
universe
is
love
it
follows
that
the
working
of
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
is
not
vindictive
its
object
is
our
highest
good
to
bring
us
into
union
with
the
divine
or
in
tune
with
the
infinite
therefore
by
rising
up
to
a
higher
plane
and
coming
more
into
harmony
and
union
with
the
divine
we
rob
even
big
fate
of
something
of
its
power
we
can
not
oppose
it
for
by
so
doing
we
fight
against
omnipotence
but
we
can
it
by
doing
willingly
and
of
our
own
accord
that
very
thing
which
experience
comes
to
teach
us
another
cause
is
that
the
soul
has
failed
to
learn
certain
lessons
therefore
in
this
life
many
painful
experiences
are
brought
to
bear
in
such
a
way
as
to
teach
the
necessary
lessons
the
lessons
are
however
learnt
only
if
painful
or
unpleasant
experiences
are
met
in
the
right
way
so
long
as
man
believes
that
he
is
unjustly
treated
by
fate
and
that
he
does
not
deserve
what
life
metes
out
to
him
he
intensifies
his
troubles
both
now
and
hereafter
through
not
learning
the
lessons
that
life
desires
to
teach
when
however
man
realizes
and
admits
that
life
is
just
and
that
the
cause
of
all
his
troubles
is
within
himself
he
like
the
prodigal
son
comes
to
himself
and
soon
afterwards
begins
his
homeward
journey
yet
another
cause
is
that
the
soul
is
deficient
in
character
strength
and
stability
of
character
can
be
built
up
through
the
soul
meeting
trouble
and
difficulty
again
it
must
be
pointed
out
that
they
must
be
met
in
the
right
spirit
it
will
be
seen
then
that
our
future
depends
entirely
upon
the
way
we
think
and
act
in
this
life
our
future
lies
in
our
own
hands
if
we
violate
the
law
of
love
in
this
life
we
create
disaster
and
suffering
for
the
future
which
will
have
to
be
met
in
the
form
of
big
fate
of
a
painful
character
some
day
therefore
by
right
thinking
and
right
doing
now
we
not
only
ameliorate
conditions
in
this
life
but
we
also
create
a
future
that
will
be
more
harmonious
and
freer
than
anything
we
have
experienced
hitherto
it
is
also
necessary
to
point
out
that
even
in
this
life
some
of
its
big
disasters
are
the
result
of
thoughts
and
actions
committed
during
this
present
existence
a
youth
or
young
man
may
commit
a
folly
that
brings
in
after
life
a
terrible
retribution
or
he
may
do
another
man
a
grievous
wrong
and
years
afterwards
someone
else
does
the
same
wrong
to
him
it
is
always
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
on
this
plane
of
cause
and
effect
but
the
great
way
shower
by
his
teaching
of
the
power
of
love
enables
us
to
rise
above
these
lower
things
and
live
a
life
of
harmony
and
peace
chapter
iv
cause
and
effect
man
is
the
cause
of
the
disasters
in
his
life
he
reaps
through
the
ages
exactly
as
he
sows
life
is
perfectly
just
and
rewards
every
man
according
to
his
works
the
fate
of
the
present
is
the
reaping
of
his
sowing
in
it
may
be
a
distant
past
therefore
the
disasters
and
sufferings
of
this
life
must
not
be
attributed
to
the
interference
of
a
capricious
and
unreasonable
god
for
the
truth
is
they
are
due
to
the
exact
working
of
a
perfectly
just
law
fate
once
created
is
irrevocable
it
can
neither
be
fought
nor
evaded
by
fighting
against
fate
man
merely
smashes
himself
to
pieces
to
do
so
is
equivalent
to
running
his
head
against
a
stone
cliff
the
harder
he
charges
the
greater
the
damage
to
his
head
but
the
cliff
is
unaffected
fate
although
largely
is
really
the
divine
purpose
of
life
therefore
to
resist
it
is
to
fight
against
god
fate
again
is
not
punishment
in
any
vindictive
sense
it
is
the
drawing
together
of
certain
remedial
experiences
through
which
the
soul
can
learn
the
lessons
it
has
failed
to
learn
in
past
ages
and
thus
attain
wisdom
the
object
of
fate
is
the
highest
good
of
the
individual
although
it
may
entail
suffering
and
painful
experiences
because
the
disasters
in
man
life
are
due
to
past
wrong
doing
it
naturally
follows
that
his
future
depends
upon
the
kind
of
life
that
he
lives
if
in
the
past
he
has
created
for
himself
a
sequence
of
events
and
experiences
from
which
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
escape
it
is
obvious
that
his
future
lives
depend
entirely
upon
how
he
lives
the
present
one
it
will
be
seen
that
if
man
can
learn
the
lessons
of
the
present
life
and
live
in
such
a
way
as
to
cease
creating
trouble
for
the
future
he
is
beginning
to
climb
the
path
of
liberation
which
is
the
road
all
advanced
souls
have
to
follow
or
rather
have
the
privilege
of
following
by
following
this
path
man
ceases
to
be
bound
to
the
wheel
of
fate
this
little
work
does
not
teach
reincarnation
but
its
teaching
is
based
on
a
belief
that
man
in
reality
is
a
spiritual
being
a
divine
spark
from
the
sacred
fire
spirit
being
immortal
has
no
beginning
or
end
therefore
always
lives
this
present
life
is
one
of
countless
experiences
each
one
of
which
helps
to
build
up
character
there
is
no
death
but
only
changes
from
one
vehicle
to
another
there
is
no
beginning
or
end
or
time
in
reality
these
are
mere
limitations
of
the
human
mind
it
is
impossible
for
man
to
die
he
can
only
leave
his
body
he
can
not
kill
himself
try
how
he
will
he
can
only
force
himself
out
of
his
body
man
must
always
go
on
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
he
proceeds
through
the
ages
exactly
as
he
we
have
already
seen
that
man
can
not
avoid
or
fight
successfully
against
fate
but
that
he
can
become
free
from
the
wheel
of
fate
by
living
a
life
in
harmony
with
divine
law
at
this
point
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
that
most
of
man
troubles
are
not
caused
by
fate
at
all
but
are
due
to
his
fighting
against
or
trying
to
resist
the
great
plan
if
the
experiences
of
life
are
resisted
or
an
attempt
is
made
to
evade
its
discipline
troubles
and
difficulties
will
repeat
becoming
more
painful
and
insistent
until
their
lesson
is
learnt
and
the
life
changed
accordingly
therefore
man
has
it
in
his
power
greatly
to
improve
his
present
life
as
well
as
to
create
a
far
better
future
simply
by
living
his
life
in
harmony
with
divine
law
further
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
that
all
thought
and
action
have
an
as
well
as
a
far
reaching
effect
it
is
true
that
the
full
effect
of
life
here
is
not
reaped
until
after
our
little
course
on
this
plane
has
been
run
but
great
differences
are
effected
in
the
present
life
nevertheless
the
way
a
youth
makes
use
of
or
throws
away
his
opportunities
either
makes
or
mars
to
a
very
large
extent
his
adult
career
opportunities
once
allowed
to
pass
can
never
be
recalled
sins
committed
and
wrongs
done
to
our
fellow
men
have
an
unpleasant
habit
of
repeating
themselves
in
a
reversed
way
later
in
life
for
instance
a
man
may
get
on
in
life
and
in
his
selfish
climb
may
trample
on
one
weaker
than
himself
ruining
him
and
driving
him
to
despair
years
afterwards
he
will
probably
be
treated
in
exactly
the
same
way
by
someone
stronger
and
more
favourably
situated
than
himself
therefore
there
is
an
immediate
sowing
and
reaping
that
finds
fruition
in
this
life
by
immediate
is
meant
within
the
compass
of
this
life
the
reaping
may
be
delayed
ten
or
twenty
years
but
in
the
writer
experience
it
not
infrequently
comes
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
those
therefore
who
think
that
life
is
not
just
and
who
whine
and
complain
about
the
way
they
are
treated
are
simply
increasing
their
own
troubles
until
man
realizes
that
the
cause
of
all
his
troubles
is
within
himself
he
can
never
do
anything
to
remedy
matters
because
obviously
the
only
thing
that
is
required
is
for
him
to
change
within
man
has
to
become
changed
within
before
his
life
can
be
altered
his
thoughts
his
ideals
his
attitude
towards
life
must
all
become
transformed
when
this
change
has
been
effected
he
not
only
begins
to
repair
his
present
life
but
he
creates
a
fairer
and
nobler
life
for
the
future
this
is
the
inner
secret
of
all
esoteric
teaching
the
new
birth
or
regeneration
means
the
awakening
of
the
soul
to
conscious
immortality
the
old
self
that
was
bound
to
the
wheel
of
fate
and
the
plane
of
cause
and
effect
from
which
it
could
never
free
itself
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
was
continually
binding
itself
to
the
wheel
afresh
through
following
selfish
desires
dies
and
a
new
self
is
born
in
other
words
the
consciousness
is
raised
from
the
plane
of
sin
and
death
of
sensuality
and
desire
of
restriction
and
captivity
to
the
higher
plane
of
spirit
where
man
realizes
that
he
is
a
son
of
god
he
discovers
that
the
divine
spark
within
is
his
true
self
he
realizes
also
that
he
has
always
lived
in
his
real
spiritual
self
beginning
and
end
like
change
and
decay
belong
purely
to
the
material
plane
and
have
no
place
in
reality
they
form
part
of
this
present
three
dimensional
existence
but
have
no
reality
endless
being
is
the
reality
anything
short
of
this
is
mere
illusion
it
is
not
necessary
therefore
to
believe
in
the
theory
of
reincarnation
or
that
all
our
experiences
must
of
necessity
take
place
on
this
plane
sufficient
to
know
that
we
can
never
die
that
we
can
not
escape
from
ourselves
and
that
to
neglect
seeking
with
all
our
heart
for
union
once
again
with
our
divine
source
is
merely
to
prolong
our
sufferings
man
then
has
to
change
his
desires
and
aspirations
instead
of
being
directed
towards
hate
and
evil
must
be
transformed
to
love
and
good
instead
of
wallowing
in
lust
and
selfishness
he
must
lift
himself
to
higher
and
better
things
how
can
this
be
done
it
can
not
be
accomplished
by
the
finite
man
at
all
but
it
can
be
achieved
by
the
infinite
power
within
it
is
only
when
man
realizes
his
oneness
with
the
infinite
and
that
omnipotent
power
is
at
his
disposal
that
the
spiritual
power
within
becomes
available
so
long
as
man
has
doubts
and
fears
or
disbeliefs
this
special
power
is
not
available
it
is
his
but
his
state
of
heart
and
mind
prevents
him
from
either
realizing
the
presence
of
the
power
or
making
use
of
it
before
the
machinery
of
a
workshop
can
run
it
must
be
connected
up
with
the
engine
room
in
the
same
way
man
before
he
can
live
the
new
life
must
become
one
with
the
infinite
life
and
power
entering
this
new
life
of
power
does
not
take
away
experiences
its
trials
troubles
and
adversities
but
the
change
within
does
prevent
the
creation
of
unnecessary
troubles
and
suffering
also
even
a
unkind
fate
loses
much
of
its
power
to
wound
for
the
higher
man
rises
into
union
with
god
and
infinite
love
the
less
power
it
has
in
his
life
it
still
operates
but
it
fails
to
wound
so
deeply
for
man
seeing
with
illumined
eyes
knows
that
it
is
good
that
has
come
to
bless
and
not
evil
that
has
come
to
slay
painful
fate
loses
its
power
to
hurt
when
man
ceases
to
resist
it
and
meets
it
with
open
arms
seeking
to
learn
the
lessons
that
it
has
to
teach
chapter
success
what
is
meant
here
by
success
is
the
achievement
of
something
worth
while
that
shall
make
the
world
better
and
richer
and
add
something
to
the
common
good
our
sphere
in
life
may
be
very
humble
but
if
we
overcome
our
own
weaknesses
help
others
along
life
pathway
and
do
our
daily
work
better
than
we
need
our
life
can
not
be
other
than
successful
if
at
the
end
of
our
life
we
can
be
thankful
for
it
realizing
that
we
have
made
the
best
possible
use
of
it
we
have
achieved
real
success
success
to
the
unillumined
may
mean
the
accumulation
of
wealth
and
the
winning
of
fame
yet
those
who
give
up
their
lives
to
the
acquirement
of
these
things
are
the
greatest
failures
in
life
they
gain
wealth
it
is
true
but
they
find
that
their
money
can
buy
only
those
things
that
bring
no
satisfaction
that
it
can
not
purchase
for
them
any
of
the
things
which
are
really
worth
having
success
of
this
hollow
kind
can
be
won
but
at
too
great
a
price
the
greatest
teacher
of
all
once
said
for
what
shall
it
profit
man
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
what
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gets
on
at
the
cost
of
happiness
health
joy
of
living
domestic
life
and
the
ability
to
appreciate
nature
beauties
and
simple
pleasures
yet
man
must
be
a
striver
he
must
be
for
ever
seeking
better
things
and
to
express
himself
more
perfectly
one
who
drifts
through
life
making
no
effort
to
rise
to
better
things
is
not
worthy
of
the
name
of
citizen
man
if
he
is
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
must
be
for
ever
striving
overcoming
rising
failure
in
life
is
always
due
to
weakness
of
character
it
is
only
strong
characters
who
can
resist
the
buffetings
of
life
and
overcome
its
difficulties
the
man
who
would
make
his
life
worthy
of
respect
and
who
would
rise
to
high
achievement
and
service
will
be
confronted
by
difficulty
at
every
turn
this
is
as
it
should
be
for
it
weeds
out
the
weaklings
and
unworthy
aspirants
and
awards
the
spoils
to
those
who
exhibit
faith
courage
steadfastness
patience
perseverance
persistence
cheerfulness
and
strength
of
character
generally
success
especially
material
success
is
not
in
itself
of
much
benefit
to
the
one
who
wins
it
it
does
not
satisfy
for
long
but
it
is
valuable
in
other
ways
for
instance
success
based
on
service
is
a
benefit
to
the
community
if
it
were
not
for
successful
people
of
this
type
the
ordinary
man
in
the
rut
would
have
a
bad
time
also
the
winning
of
success
builds
up
character
one
who
would
be
successful
in
the
battle
of
life
must
be
prepared
to
be
tested
and
tried
in
every
possible
way
one
who
survives
them
all
is
built
up
in
character
in
almost
every
direction
even
in
his
success
however
he
will
be
tempted
and
tried
one
who
is
engaged
in
the
harsh
struggle
of
business
or
who
takes
part
in
public
life
may
if
he
does
not
watch
himself
very
carefully
become
hard
and
callous
of
all
failures
this
is
probably
the
worst
one
who
succeeds
in
other
directions
and
becomes
a
hard
man
is
after
all
a
sorry
failure
again
people
of
the
successful
striving
climbing
type
are
tempted
far
more
than
those
who
are
afraid
to
venture
and
who
remain
in
the
valley
of
mediocrity
this
is
true
not
only
of
those
who
seek
to
climb
the
steep
path
of
spiritual
attainment
but
also
of
those
who
are
successful
in
mundane
affairs
in
each
case
they
have
placed
in
their
keeping
great
powers
and
influence
such
as
the
ordinary
man
little
dreams
of
this
is
a
grave
responsibility
for
if
these
powers
are
used
for
the
results
are
disastrous
thus
those
who
climb
are
beset
on
all
sides
by
temptations
of
a
very
subtle
kind
which
if
yielded
to
will
ruin
the
life
and
do
grave
injury
to
the
soul
life
is
a
continual
battle
to
the
ordinary
person
it
is
generally
a
fight
with
circumstances
and
the
ordinary
difficulties
of
life
which
are
very
important
in
his
eyes
the
more
advanced
soul
is
not
troubled
much
by
these
things
he
rises
above
them
but
he
is
tempted
and
tried
to
a
much
greater
degree
and
in
a
far
more
subtle
manner
those
who
think
that
by
following
a
certain
cult
or
ism
they
will
be
able
to
have
an
uneventful
walk
through
life
are
merely
deluding
themselves
as
he
learns
to
overcome
the
difficulties
of
life
which
baffle
the
ordinary
individual
he
will
be
tempted
and
tried
in
other
and
more
subtle
ways
this
is
because
life
is
not
for
mere
passing
pleasure
but
is
for
the
building
up
of
character
through
experience
therefore
one
who
would
succeed
must
be
strong
and
wise
and
patient
those
who
aspire
to
make
their
lives
really
worth
while
who
desire
to
serve
their
fellows
more
perfectly
who
want
to
build
up
character
through
experience
and
overcome
all
their
weaknesses
inherited
or
otherwise
must
look
within
for
power
and
wisdom
it
must
be
pointed
out
however
that
man
must
not
use
his
spiritual
powers
for
selfish
purposes
and
there
is
an
immutable
law
which
has
been
known
to
the
inner
teaching
all
through
the
ages
that
forbids
the
use
of
spiritual
powers
for
the
creation
of
wealth
or
even
of
daily
bread
jesus
was
subject
to
the
same
spiritual
law
and
was
tempted
exactly
in
the
same
way
as
we
the
tempter
said
command
this
stone
that
it
be
made
bread
if
christ
had
turned
the
stone
into
bread
he
would
have
failed
in
his
great
mission
but
he
knew
the
law
there
are
thousands
of
people
who
are
trying
not
only
to
turn
by
the
of
their
spiritual
powers
stones
into
bread
but
also
into
motor
cars
fat
bank
balances
and
lands
and
houses
such
are
heading
to
disaster
for
they
are
working
the
combined
spiritual
power
of
the
universe
the
enemy
of
souls
offers
those
who
have
learned
to
tap
the
inexhaustible
power
of
the
universe
and
who
have
discovered
that
they
are
sons
of
god
wealth
power
pomp
the
applause
of
men
the
glittering
things
that
perish
if
only
they
will
their
power
like
jesus
they
must
refuse
they
must
put
service
before
self
and
give
instead
of
grasping
thousands
are
being
taught
to
force
their
human
will
upon
life
and
to
use
occult
powers
for
the
acquisition
of
wealth
and
power
they
are
taught
to
enter
the
silence
and
demand
what
they
want
how
to
get
what
you
want
is
the
slogan
of
these
modern
teachers
not
merit
not
service
not
giving
but
demanding
compelling
by
human
and
by
the
use
of
occult
forces
this
is
another
device
of
the
enemy
of
souls
and
it
is
taking
tens
of
thousands
of
seekers
for
truth
out
of
the
path
this
subject
is
dealt
with
more
fully
in
a
separate
chapter
if
however
man
ambition
is
to
serve
and
to
give
instead
of
to
grasp
and
to
grab
if
also
he
seeks
success
through
merit
and
not
through
the
of
his
spiritual
powers
he
can
go
forward
and
the
power
will
go
with
him
and
will
help
him
when
once
the
power
has
been
aroused
man
must
cease
all
purely
selfish
striving
although
of
course
there
will
still
be
much
selfishness
in
his
motive
he
must
seek
his
success
through
service
and
through
following
noble
aims
through
merit
and
a
fair
exchange
instead
of
trying
to
wring
success
from
life
no
matter
who
may
suffer
thereby
further
when
this
power
has
been
brought
into
expression
it
must
only
be
used
in
love
for
if
it
used
otherwise
it
will
destroy
the
user
again
the
power
must
not
be
used
by
the
finite
human
will
but
an
endeavour
must
be
made
to
find
what
the
will
of
the
whole
is
and
to
work
in
harmony
with
it
behind
each
life
is
the
divine
will
and
purpose
each
life
is
perfect
as
it
is
imaged
in
the
universal
mind
the
highest
success
indeed
the
only
true
success
is
to
live
the
life
according
to
the
great
cosmic
purpose
or
in
other
words
as
it
is
imaged
in
the
one
mind
do
not
imagine
however
that
it
is
the
will
of
the
universal
mind
that
man
should
be
a
failure
or
lacking
in
achievement
far
from
it
for
we
have
only
to
contemplate
the
universe
to
see
that
the
infinite
mind
is
for
ever
achieving
and
that
it
never
fails
man
too
must
succeed
but
let
him
mix
wisdom
with
his
ambition
and
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
rather
than
for
any
purely
selfish
purpose
it
is
natural
for
man
to
get
on
in
life
to
a
moderate
extent
in
order
to
get
on
he
must
become
more
efficient
and
thus
serve
life
and
his
fellows
better
therefore
there
is
no
harm
in
success
of
this
kind
it
is
natural
and
laudable
also
for
one
in
poor
and
unlovely
surroundings
to
have
an
ambition
to
raise
himself
to
better
circumstances
it
is
only
right
that
he
should
desire
to
make
life
brighter
and
better
for
his
wife
and
family
so
long
as
he
indulges
in
ambition
wisely
and
if
he
seeks
success
through
to
his
fellows
his
is
a
laudable
purpose
if
however
he
does
not
curb
and
control
his
ambition
but
allows
it
to
run
away
with
him
he
will
lose
all
real
joy
in
life
and
at
the
last
when
it
is
too
late
learn
to
his
sorrow
that
his
life
through
too
much
success
has
been
a
failure
it
must
not
be
deduced
from
this
that
the
author
deprecates
large
achievement
there
must
always
be
the
few
who
have
to
bear
huge
responsibilities
the
real
success
of
the
lives
of
these
great
ones
depends
entirely
upon
their
motive
if
they
seek
merely
power
fame
and
then
their
life
no
matter
how
it
may
appear
otherwise
can
be
only
a
failure
if
however
their
motive
is
service
then
their
life
is
truly
successful
no
matter
how
it
may
appear
to
be
otherwise
the
writer
experience
has
been
that
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
always
be
progressing
achieving
overcoming
and
endeavouring
to
succeed
one
of
the
greatest
laws
of
the
universe
is
progress
therefore
it
is
fatal
to
stand
still
we
must
go
forward
we
must
achieve
we
must
accomplish
things
if
we
do
so
we
may
find
that
many
things
which
cost
us
much
effort
and
hard
work
are
not
worth
the
having
yet
all
the
time
we
are
learning
through
experience
and
are
being
strengthened
and
prepared
for
greater
things
through
repeated
failure
to
find
true
satisfaction
we
arrive
finally
at
true
knowledge
wisdom
and
understanding
we
are
wise
then
if
with
the
world
at
our
feet
we
can
be
satisfied
with
a
very
moderate
material
success
and
turn
our
attention
and
aspirations
to
higher
and
better
things
in
concluding
this
chapter
let
it
be
pointed
out
that
success
and
achievement
will
not
drop
ready
made
from
heaven
into
your
lap
all
who
succeed
are
gluttons
for
work
toiling
whilst
others
play
and
sleep
all
teaching
to
the
contrary
is
erroneous
to
think
that
success
is
going
to
come
to
you
when
it
is
unmerited
simply
because
you
make
use
of
affirmations
or
employ
mental
treatments
is
folly
of
the
first
water
on
the
other
hand
to
use
the
inner
forces
in
an
occult
way
so
as
to
compel
material
things
or
success
in
any
shape
or
form
to
come
to
you
is
black
magic
one
who
stoops
to
such
practices
becomes
a
black
magician
earning
for
himself
a
terrible
retribution
there
is
only
one
way
to
succeed
in
the
affairs
of
life
and
that
is
by
raising
oneself
to
greater
usefulness
and
service
by
doing
things
better
than
they
have
been
done
before
by
bearing
greater
responsibility
you
serve
humanity
better
and
therefore
merit
success
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
said
the
master
and
this
is
true
even
in
the
practical
and
material
affairs
of
life
first
you
must
give
better
and
more
valuable
service
in
other
words
deserve
and
merit
before
you
expect
to
see
it
materialize
you
must
sow
before
you
can
reap
you
must
become
too
big
for
your
present
position
before
you
are
capable
of
occupying
a
larger
one
you
must
grow
and
expand
in
every
possible
way
and
as
you
grow
so
will
your
success
increase
outward
success
is
only
a
reflection
so
to
speak
of
what
you
really
are
and
a
result
of
greater
and
more
valuable
service
to
humanity
it
requires
great
effort
and
determination
to
get
out
of
the
rut
but
so
long
as
your
ambition
is
not
ignoble
or
selfish
there
will
be
found
within
you
power
sufficient
for
all
your
needs
to
win
success
either
in
the
of
life
or
the
more
difficult
path
of
spiritual
progress
demands
imagination
vision
courage
faith
determination
persistence
perseverance
hope
cheerfulness
and
other
qualities
these
are
all
to
be
found
within
all
these
qualities
lie
more
or
less
dormant
within
and
can
be
called
into
expression
if
we
believe
that
infinite
power
is
ours
again
however
must
the
warning
be
repeated
that
this
power
must
not
be
used
for
selfish
still
less
may
it
be
used
or
rather
either
to
influence
or
dominate
others
if
this
power
is
the
results
are
terrible
and
disastrous
therefore
use
the
power
only
for
the
achievement
of
good
and
noble
aims
and
in
service
which
shall
enrich
the
life
of
your
fellows
adding
to
the
common
good
having
arrived
at
this
stage
you
must
go
forward
there
can
be
no
holding
back
ever
onward
the
divine
urge
is
sending
you
to
greater
achievement
and
accomplishment
just
as
surely
as
the
planets
must
revolve
round
the
sun
and
fulfil
their
destiny
so
also
must
you
go
forward
see
to
it
then
that
your
aims
and
ambitions
are
based
upon
eternal
wisdom
for
upon
this
does
your
whole
future
depend
chapter

health
it
is
impossible
in
a
little
work
of
this
description
to
explain
why
it
is
that
one
person
inherits
a
weak
and
ailing
body
and
another
enjoys
a
strong
and
robust
constitution
sufficient
for
us
here
to
notice
that
the
days
of
rude
rugged
health
are
passing
and
that
man
is
becoming
more
highly
strung
nervous
and
psychic
in
his
the
old
type
of
rude
unconscious
health
was
due
to
the
nature
of
man
which
caused
his
body
to
be
governed
more
completely
by
the
instinctive
mind
less
evolved
humans
are
not
affected
apparently
by
the
mental
storms
psychic
changes
and
spiritual
disharmonies
that
disturb
the
health
of
the
more
evolved
types
we
have
an
illustration
of
this
in
the
case
of
some
forms
of
insanity
the
patient
goes
out
of
his
mind
with
the
result
that
his
bodily
health
becomes
wonderfully
good
the
instinctive
mind
takes
control
of
things
and
rude
robust
animal
health
is
the
result
when
the
patient
was
sane
and
his
mind
filled
with
worry
ambitions
plans
cares
lusts
hates
and
griefs
he
was
probably
very
far
from
well
this
would
be
due
to
the
disturbing
effects
of
his
thoughts
and
uncontrolled
emotions
when
therefore
his
conscious
mind
gave
way
and
he
became
happy
in
an
imbecile
way
he
ceased
to
think
of
these
disturbing
things
with
the
result
that
the
instinctive
animal
mind
was
able
to
work
undisturbed
it
is
of
no
use
sighing
for
the
good
old
times
when
people
were
rugged
and
strong
in
the
way
that
savages
are
rugged
and
strong
for
evolution
has
decreed
that
man
shall
change
into
a
higher
and
more
nervous
and
sensitive
type
in
this
sensitive
type
wrong
thoughts
and
emotions
quickly
produce
pain
and
suffering
the
majority
of
people
do
not
know
what
good
health
is
not
only
do
they
suffer
from
minor
ailments
such
as
headaches
indigestion
rheumatism
neuritis
but
they
also
never
feel
hearty
or
completely
well
they
are
strangers
to
the
joy
of
living
life
does
not
thrill
them
nothing
quickens
their
blood
they
have
no
moments
of
vivid
ecstasy
in
other
words
they
do
not
live
they
merely
exist
at
a
poor
dying
rate
again
the
majority
of
people
are
susceptible
to
infectious
diseases
and
epidemics
yet
if
they
were
really
well
they
would
be
immune
instead
however
of
seeking
immunity
through
health
they
are
seeking
it
through
the
use
of
vaccines
and
serums
thus
adding
to
the
burdens
which
the
body
has
to
bear
all
attempts
in
this
direction
are
bound
to
end
in
failure
for
as
fast
as
one
disease
is
suppressed
another
one
will
appear
many
people
look
upon
disease
and
sickness
as
inevitable
yet
the
truth
is
that
health
is
the
normal
state
and
an
abnormality
in
tracing
back
to
its
source
we
find
first
of
all
that
it
is
due
to
disobedience
of
natural
law
large
numbers
of
people
break
nearly
every
known
natural
law
of
health
and
are
surprised
that
they
become
ill
yet
the
wonder
is
that
they
are
as
well
as
they
are
yet
while
obedience
to
nature
laws
and
the
use
of
methods
will
carry
us
a
certain
part
of
the
way
we
find
that
there
must
be
causes
even
deeper
than
those
which
are
physical
we
are
confronted
by
the
fact
that
there
are
many
people
who
obey
every
known
physical
law
of
health
who
bathe
exercise
breathe
eat
and
drink
scientifically
who
adopt
methods
instead
of
drugs
and
serums
who
yet
can
not
find
health
therefore
we
must
search
deeper
and
go
to
the
mind
in
order
to
discover
the
cause
of
when
we
look
to
the
mind
we
find
a
prolific
cause
of
sickness
man
thinks
himself
into
and
disease
it
is
well
known
that
thinking
about
disease
and
sickness
produces
them
in
the
body
people
who
are
for
ever
thinking
about
disease
illness
operations
and
other
morbid
subjects
become
a
prey
to
these
things
those
who
believe
that
sickness
is
inevitable
manifest
it
in
their
life
morbid
thinking
produces
a
morbid
state
of
the
body
causing
it
either
to
fall
an
easy
prey
to
infection
or
to
break
down
into
chronic
or
even
disease
allowing
the
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
morbid
things
is
a
sure
way
to
sickness
and
invalidism
man
is
not
only
made
ill
by
his
own
negative
thoughts
and
emotions
he
is
also
under
the
hypnotic
spell
of
the
race
mind
the
god
of
this
world
hath
blinded
the
minds
of
them
which
believe
not
we
are
all
under
the
spell
more
or
less
of
a
huge
illusion
the
evil
disease
sickness
and
other
imperfections
that
we
see
and
experience
have
no
reality
but
have
an
in
although
they
are
not
real
in
a
real
sense
yet
they
are
terribly
real
to
this
present
limited
consciousness
by
realizing
the
truth
and
by
thinking
and
living
in
its
light
and
power
the
hypnotic
spell
becomes
broken
not
completely
else
we
should
not
grow
old
but
to
such
an
extent
that
a
state
of
greatly
improved
health
can
be
enjoyed
for
a
fuller
explanation
of
this
metaphysical
statement
see
science
of
thought
text
books
nos
and
ii
we
are
also
hypnotically
affected
by
suggestion
which
reaches
us
from
a
thousand
different
sources
the
conversations
of
friends
and
acquaintances
affect
us
adversely
their
belief
in
disease
and
sickness
as
realities
and
in
its
inevitableness
colours
all
their
conversation
and
unless
we
guard
against
it
this
unconsciously
affects
us
newspapers
magazines
books
all
steeped
in
the
same
error
also
influence
us
unless
we
have
become
too
positive
to
be
affected
from
innumerable
sources
it
is
subtly
suggested
to
us
that
disease
sickness
infection
are
realities
that
can
not
be
evaded
and
to
which
we
are
prone
the
effect
of
all
this
putting
it
in
simple
and
elementary
language
is
to
divert
the
life
power
into
wrong
channels
thus
producing
disease
and
in
place
of
perfection
the
normal
state
of
health
has
to
give
place
to
an
abnormal
state
of
disease
or
sickness
the
normal
is
however
restored
when
truth
is
realized
and
the
life
lived
in
its
light
and
power
absolute
truth
and
perfection
stand
behind
all
the
illusion
and
imperfection
of
the
sense
life
it
is
by
realizing
the
truth
and
the
perfection
of
the
reality
and
by
establishing
the
in
truth
so
that
our
thoughts
cease
to
be
negative
and
based
on
error
and
illusion
that
health
is
to
be
found
it
is
often
said
that
is
the
result
of
sin
it
is
for
thinking
about
disease
sickness
and
believing
them
to
be
inevitable
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
sins
the
way
of
life
is
to
walk
think
and
act
after
the
spirit
which
is
perfect
whole
immortal
and
incorruptible
and
not
after
the
flesh
corruption
disease
sickness
death
by
thinking
after
the
flesh
we
dishonour
god
who
is
absolute
wholeness
and
perfection
and
cut
ourselves
off
from
the
divine
life
and
power
but
there
are
other
ways
by
which
wrong
thinking
destroys
the
health
thinking
thoughts
of
lust
is
a
prolific
cause
of
unhappiness
sickness
and
nervous
disease
the
divine
forces
of
life
are
directed
into
a
wrong
channel
resulting
either
in
indulgence
and
inevitable
weakening
of
body
brain
and
will
or
in
repression
and
its
consequent
nervous
diseases
if
the
thoughts
are
allowed
to
dwell
upon
impurity
evil
results
must
follow
in
some
form
either
in
action
or
or
both
thought
must
be
controlled
and
reversed
continually
not
repressed
but
reversed
be
it
noted
for
there
is
a
tremendous
difference
between
the
two
repression
creates
nervous
trouble
but
by
reversing
or
transmuting
the
thoughts
the
life
becomes
transformed
and
the
bodily
health
greatly
improved
further
indulging
in
thoughts
of
hate
resentment
fear
worry
care
grief
and
anxiety
produces
and
by
lowering
the
tone
of
the
body
lays
it
open
to
infection
and
disease
we
therefore
see
that
the
state
of
the
mind
and
the
character
of
the
thoughts
are
important
factors
which
can
not
be
ignored
it
is
useless
to
treat
either
or
disease
if
they
are
merely
the
external
of
hidden
causes
of
the
mind
in
order
to
effect
a
cure
we
have
to
get
back
to
the
cause
of
the
trouble
thought
control
is
a
great
assistance
substituting
a
right
or
positive
thought
for
a
wrong
one
will
in
course
of
time
work
wonders
in
the
life
in
the
we
have
an
illimitable
power
of
extraordinary
intelligence
according
to
our
thoughts
this
wonderful
power
either
builds
up
health
harmony
and
beauty
in
our
life
and
body
or
just
the
reverse
the
power
is
good
the
intelligence
is
apparently
infinite
but
it
goes
our
thoughts
direct
it
by
our
thinking
therefore
we
either
create
or
destroy
produce
either
good
or
evil
if
therefore
all
our
thoughts
are
good
positive
and
constructive
it
follows
that
both
our
body
and
our
life
must
become
built
up
in
harmony
and
perfection
the
question
is
can
this
be
done
it
can
be
done
if
we
have
the
desire
and
are
willing
to
discipline
ourselves
and
persevere
in
the
face
often
of
seeming
failure
some
readers
may
say
at
this
point
that
they
have
no
desire
to
be
so
frightfully
good
that
they
are
not
prepared
to
give
up
lust
impurity
hate
anger
malice
and
thoughts
and
emotions
of
this
kind
very
well
if
this
is
so
they
must
go
on
and
learn
through
suffering
the
lesson
which
they
refuse
to
learn
willingly
others
may
say
yes
i
want
to
control
my
thoughts
but
how
can
i
cease
to
worry
when
i
have
so
much
about
which
to
worry
and
how
can
i
cease
to
hate
when
i
have
been
so
deeply
wronged
this
brings
us
to
an
even
deeper
cause
of
than
that
of
mind
the
attitude
of
the
heart
our
scriptures
tell
us
that
as
a
man
thinketh
in
his
so
is
he
by
heart
is
meant
the
soul
or
feeling
desiring
part
of
man
it
is
here
where
the
conflict
between
the
and
the
divine
will
between
the
desires
of
the
flesh
and
the
longings
of
the
spirit
take
place
the
real
root
cause
of
all
unhappiness
disharmony
and
is
spiritual
and
not
merely
mental
or
physical
the
latter
are
contributory
causes
but
the
former
is
the
fundamental
cause
spiritual
disharmony
is
in
reality
the
cause
of
all
and
disease
until
spiritual
harmony
is
restored
man
is
a
kingdom
divided
against
itself
which
as
our
lord
said
can
not
stand
healing
then
must
be
of
a
spiritual
character
until
this
harmony
exists
there
can
be
no
overcoming
of
hate
thoughts
fear
thoughts
or
worry
thoughts
and
until
these
are
overcome
there
can
be
no
true
healing
our
lord
healing
was
a
gracious
healing
of
the
spirit
it
restored
inward
harmony
by
forgiving
sin
by
changing
the
heart
desires
by
bringing
the
will
of
the
subject
into
harmony
with
the
divine
will
of
the
whole
our
lord
healing
was
not
accomplished
by
means
of
suggestion
neither
was
it
achieved
by
human
will
power
it
was
done
by
a
bringing
into
harmony
of
the
heart
and
desires
and
will
with
the
divine
will
at
the
same
time
there
must
have
been
a
revelation
of
the
truth
that
the
will
of
god
is
love
wholeness
joy
and
perfection
and
not
disease
sickness
and
misery

does

resentment
thoughts
by
transmuting
them
into
thoughts
of
love
until
we
surrender
to
the
divine
will
and
leave
all
our
problems
to
the
infinite
mind
we
can
not
cease
to
worry
and
fear
mental
discipline
and
are
necessary
after
this
inward
change
has
taken
place
for
we
all
have
to
work
out
our
own
salvation
but
the
essential
thing
is
the
inward
heart
surrender
in
love
and
trust
so
long
as
we
hate
our
brother
or
fear
what
the
morrow
may
bring
forth
or
worry
about
the
things
of
this
life
we
can
never
be
well
when
however
we
have
become
attuned
to
the
divine
harmony
and
have
learnt
to
control
our
thoughts
and
emotions
and
to
transmute
fleshly
and
material
desires
into
loving
service
a
state
of
wholeness
is
the
inevitable
result
old
disorders
die
away
and
a
steady
improvement
in
the
state
of
health
takes
its
place
in
order
to
regain
health
it
is
necessary
to
raise
oneself
up
continually
to
the
divine
ideal
of
health
harmony
and
perfection
but
this
is
useless
if
there
still
remains
a
clashing
of
the
personal
will
with
the
divine
will
or
if
there
is
any
hate
malice
envy
or
fear
in
the
heart
the
will
must
be
surrendered
to
the
greater
will
this
in
reality
is
our
highest
good
for
the
fulfilment
of
the
divine
will
is
the
happy
destiny
of
man
the
heart
must
forgive
and
be
filled
with
love
fear
must
be
cast
out
and
replaced
by
confidence
and
complete
trust
before
we
can
enter
into
that
happy
restful
state
which
is
necessary
for
healing
health
is
harmony
a
delicate
balance
and
adjustment
between
spirit
soul
mind
and
body
this
harmony
is
dependent
entirely
upon
the
greater
harmony
between
ourselves
and
god
so
long
as
there
is
a
conflict
of
will
so
long
as
there
is
hate
or
resentment
so
long
as
there
is
selfishness
or
while
there
is
fear
this
harmony
can
not
exist
therefore
the
cause
of
health
is
spiritual
harmony
all
healing
being
a
restoration
of
harmony
between
man
and
his
divine
source
when
this
harmony
is
restored
man
is
no
longer
a
kingdom
divided
against
itself
for
he
becomes
established
in
he
works
with
the
universe
and
the
divine
laws
of
his
being
instead
of
against
them
the
divine
life
and
power
flow
through
him
unimpeded
promoting
perfect
functioning
his
thoughts
become
cleansed
at
their
source
create
in
me
a
clean
heart
o
god
and
renew
a
right
spirit
within
me
cleanse
thou
me
from
faults
he
becomes
free
from
the
hypnotic
spell
of
the
race
mind
his
eyes
through
the
influence
of
the
divine
spirit
become
opened
to
the
truth
therefore
he
is
no
longer
blinded
by
the
prince
of
this
world
in
the
divine
union
he
becomes
free
in
christ
all
are
made
alive
the
subject
of
grief
and
its
effect
upon
health
has
purposely
been
left
to
the
last
no
amount
of
right
thinking
will
prevent
bereavements
in
this
life
these
form
part
of
the
necessary
discipline
of
life
and
it
depends
entirely
upon
how
we
meet
our
trials
whether
they
shall
be
hurtful
or
the
greatest
possible
blessing
by
rebelling
against
life
discipline
griefs
become
hurtful
but
the
hurt
is
not
in
the
bereavement
itself
but
in
the
attitude
of
the
mind
and
heart
until
the
soul
is
able
to
drink
the
cup
of
sorrow
willingly
and
say
thy
will
be
done
bereavement
is
hurtful
destroying
both
health
and
happiness
the
cause
of
the
hurt
is
however
in
the
hardness
of
heart
and
not
in
the
bereavement
itself
there
must
therefore
be
submission
and
an
acknowledgment
that
the
discipline
is
necessary
this
does
not
imply
however
a
weak
to
grief
and
mourning
one
who
has
been
bereaved
can
never
it
is
true
be
the
same
again
for
he
or
she
becomes
more
chastened
more
loving
more
sympathetic
richer
and
more
mellow
in
character
the
loved
one
can
never
be
forgotten
but
that
is
no
reason
why
the
heart
should
be
bowed
down
by
grief
and
the
life
made
desolate
by
sorrow
in
such
cases
true
religion
not
religiousness
is
the
only
thing
that
can
satisfy
the
soul
harmonize
the
mind
and
heal
the
body
to
be
established
in
truth
knowing
that
all
is
well
that
god
makes
no
mistakes
and
that
there
is
in
reality
no
death
but
only
change
is
the
only
way
by
which
bereavement
can
be
made
to
be
a
blessing
in
disguise
when
this
stage
is
reached
grief
is
overcome
death
being
swallowed
up
in
victory
the
only
panacea
for
all
troubles
is
conscious
harmony
with
our
divine
source
and
the
divine
will
and
purpose

vii
the
secret
of
abundant
supply
it
is
a
metaphysical
truth
that
the
outward
life
is
a
reflection
of
the
thought
life
our
life
is
affected
by
our
habit
of
thinking
and
attitude
of
mind
in
two
ways
first
all
our
actions
are
unconsciously
influenced
by
our
thoughts
thus
helping
to
bring
into
manifestation
or
attracting
to
us
an
environment
that
corresponds
to
our
thoughts
secondly
we
discharge
or
emit
an
influence
silent
and
invisible
that
no
doubt
affects
other
people
they
are
probably
not
aware
of
it
but
they
are
either
repelled
or
attracted
by
this
silent
influence
thus
if
our
thoughts
and
mental
attitude
are
of
the
wrong
type
not
only
are
our
actions
affected
thereby
but
also
we
exert
a
silent
influence
that
assists
in
driving
the
right
type
of
friends
opportunity
success
and
every
possible
good
away
from
us
the
reverse
also
is
equally
true
by
right
thoughts
and
a
correct
mental
attitude
we
naturally
attract
to
us
all
the
good
of
which
our
present
life
is
capable
this
may
seem
at
first
sight
to
be
a
sweeping
statement
but
two
homely
illustrations
will
prove
its
reasonableness
first
we
will
take
the
case
of
a
man
committed
to
prison
for
his
environment
is
obviously
due
to
his
wrong
actions
the
latter
being
the
offspring
of
his
thoughts
for
all
actions
spring
from
thoughts
next
let
us
take
the
case
of
a
man
who
is
the
trusted
head
of
an
efficient
business
obviously
his
position
is
the
result
of
his
actions
for
he
has
climbed
to
it
by
hard
work
and
faithful
service
all
due
in
the
first
place
to
constructive
thinking
and
a
right
attitude
of
mind
the
bible
tells
us
that
as
a
man
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
as
a
man
so
does
he
and
that
as
he
thinks
so
do
his
outer
life
and
circumstances
become
therefore
as
a
man
so
is
his
environment
this
may
sound
rather
metaphysical
but
it
is
really
quite
simple
and
proof
meets
us
at
every
turn
take
a
man
from
slumdom
and
put
him
in
nice
surroundings
and
note
what
happens
very
soon
he
either
drifts
back
to
a
slum
or
turns
his
new
house
into
a
slum
dwelling
take
a
man
of
a
higher
type
and
put
him
in
a
slum
and
soon
he
will
either
leave
the
slum
or
change
his
slum
dwelling
into
a
more
decent
habitation
put
a
slut
in
a
mansion
and
she
will
turn
it
into
a
but
put
a
woman
of
a
higher
type
in
a
hovel
and
she
will
make
it
clean
enough
to
entertain
royalty
therefore
before
you
can
change
a
environment
it
is
necessary
to
change
inwardly
the
person
himself
when
a
man
becomes
inwardly
changed
and
filled
with
new
ambitions
ideals
and
hopes
he
in
course
of
time
rises
above
his
sordid
surroundings
and
to
himself
an
environment
that
corresponds
to
his
new
state
of
it
would
be
useless
to
tidy
up
the
house
of
a
slut
for
her
for
she
would
soon
make
it
like
a
again
but
if
you
could
get
a
new
ideal
of
neatness
cleanliness
order
and
spotlessness
into
her
mind
she
would
not
rest
satisfied
until
her
immediate
environment
corresponded
in
some
measure
at
least
to
her
mental
ideal
or
image
very
often
the
failures
of
a
man
life
and
its
disharmonies
and
poverty
either
comparative
or
real
are
outward
symbols
of
his
weakness
of
character
he
may
have
ability
in
plenty
but
he
may
lack
application
or
steadfastness
and
thus
he
fails
in
all
his
undertakings
and
has
to
be
kept
by
his
wife
and
daughters
he
will
assure
you
that
his
circumstances
are
due
to
but
the
actual
cause
of
his
failure
is
in
his
character
or
rather
lack
of
character
if
therefore
a
man
poverty
and
lack
or
financial
difficulties
are
due
to
weakness
of
character
which
manifest
in
his
work
and
dealings
with
others
in
the
form
of
inefficiency
poor
service
and
bad
judgment
it
follows
that
he
himself
must
change
before
his
circumstances
can
be
permanently
altered
for
the
better
the
difficulty
in
dealing
with
unsuccessful
people
is
in
getting
them
to
realize
that
they
themselves
are
the
cause
of
all
their
troubles
until
however
they
do
realize
this
their
case
is
hopeless
and
it
is
impossible
to
help
them
but
when
they
acknowledge
that
the
fault
is
theirs
they
can
be
shown
that
there
is
a
remedy
for
their
ills
and
a
way
out
of
their
difficulties
by
means
of
let
them
then
search
for
hidden
weaknesses
and
build
up
those
weak
places
in
their
character
such
as
lack
of
grit
determination
steadfastness
persistence
patience
probity
decision
which
are
the
cause
of
their
troubles
and
they
will
find
that
their
circumstances
will
gradually
change
for
the
better
everything
comes
from
within
first
within
then
out
this
is
the
law
therefore
the
change
must
always
take
place
within

the
fundamentals
of
true
success

the

author
and
published

press
chichester
going
more
deeply
into
the
subject
and
becoming
more
metaphysical
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
that
the
cause
of
all
manifestation
is
mind
we
have
already
seen
that
a
man
mind
and
character
are
reflected
in
his
circumstances
now
let
us
think
for
a
moment
about
the
mind
that
is
infinite
the
whole
universe
which
is
of
course
infinite
in
extent
has
its
origin
in
the
divine
mind
and
contained
within
this
infinite
just
in
the
same
way
that
you
can
hold
a
mental
picture
in
your
own
mind
god
universe
it
is
imaged
in
the
divine
is
perfect
we
see
it
as
imperfect
because
we
only
receive
a
finite
of
that
which
is
perfect
and
infinite
from
this
forming
in
our
minds
an
image
that
is
necessarily
imperfect
and
finite
which
we
project
outwards
and
not
knowing
any
better
think
is
real
but
the
universe
imaged
in
the
divine
and
as
it
actually
is
in
reality
is
both
infinite
and
perfect
it
is
also
infinitely
perfect
there
is
no
poverty
or
lack
in
a
universe
that
is
infinitely
perfect
whole
and
complete
in
the
divine
mind
poverty
and
lack
have
their
origin
in
the
mind
of
man
they
have
no
place
in
the
mind
of
god
we
can
not
in
a
little
elementary
work
of
this
kind
go
more
deeply
into
this
extremely
fascinating
subject
sufficient
if
we
say
here
that
the
only
reality
is
infinite
perfection
and
wholeness
therefore
there
can
not
be
any
lack
at
all
in
reality
the
obvious
lack
and
poverty
that
we
see
around
us
are
the
product
of
the
human
mind
those
who
live
in
a
consciousness
of
poverty
and
lack
go
through
life
closely
fettered
by
limitation
they
can
never
escape
from
poverty
it
dogs
their
footsteps
like
their
shadow
in
fact
it
is
a
shadow
or
reflection
in
the
outer
life
of
their
state
of
mind
and
mental
attitude
on
the
other
hand
those
who
live
in
a
consciousness
of
sufficiency
are
not
troubled
about
supply
their
circumstances
reflect
their
type
of
mind
and
mental
attitude
it
does
not
follow
that
they
will
be
rich
for
many
of
them
prefer
to
live
from
hand
to
mouth
and
quite
large
numbers
of
people
have
no
desire
whatever
to
possess
wealth
of
any
kind
but
they
have
no
worry
about
supply
for
their
needs
are
always
met
by
sufficiency
many
of
our
readers
look
upon
the
possession
of
wealth
as
an
iniquity
personally
i
do
not
see
how
at
this
stage
it
can
be
altogether
avoided
capital
is
necessary
for
the
conducting
of
business
and
for
the
carrying
out
of
enterprises
but
as
far
as
the
hoarding
of
wealth
is
concerned
i
certainly
think
that
it
is
both
unwise
and
unnecessary
there
is
nothing
more
deadening
to
the
spiritual
life
than
riches
there
is
always
hope
for
the
drunkard
and
the
harlot
but
it
is
most
difficult
although
of
course
not
impossible
for
one
who
is
burdened
by
wealth
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
some
are
able
to
do
so
but
they
are
allowed
to
enter
simply
because
they
hold
their
wealth
as
of
no
importance
merely
as
something
of
which
they
are
stewards
for
a
season
the
hoarding
of
wealth
is
just
as
unnecessary
as
poverty
they
are
both
based
upon
a
fundamental
error
this
error
is
in
thinking
that
all
supply
being
material
must
necessarily
have
a
material
source
that
it
is
limited
in
quantity
and
therefore
must
be
grabbed
at
and
fought
over
the
truth
is
of
course
that
the
source
of
supply
is
spiritual
and
therefore
without
limit
consequently
one
who
realizes
the
truth
has
no
thoughts
of
poverty
or
lack
and
ceases
to
fear
it
on
the
other
hand
he
has
no
incentive
to
hoard
or
to
grab
wealth
for
of
what
use
are
riches
to
one
whose
supply
is
for
ever
assured
all
who
enter
into
this
truth
regarding
supply
either
despise
riches
or
hold
them
very
lightly
indeed
they
cease
to
have
any
desire
for
wealth
why
should
they
have
any
such
desire
people
hanker
after
wealth
because
they
fear
poverty
with
a
deadly
fear
and
long
for
wealth
because
they
think
that
its
possession
would
release
them
from
their
fears
when
however
they
know
the
truth
they
also
know
that
their
wants
will
always
be
supplied
therefore
they
no
longer
desire
wealth
and
its
cares
and
responsibilities
wealth
is
just
as
abnormal
as
poverty
our
lord
showed
this
to
be
the
case
by
choosing
to
be
poor
but
not
in
poverty
and
by
his
teaching
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
what
jesus
promised
was
adequate
supply
but
not
wealth
or
riches
to
those
who
had
sufficient
faith
in
their
heavenly
father
many
people
live
this
planless
life
of
utter
dependence
upon
their
spiritual
source
they
never
become
rich
but
all
their
needs
are
supplied
something
always
arrives
in
time
to
meet
their
requirements
such
a
life
requires
a
very
live
and
active
faith
but
its
results
are
as
certain
as
the
rising
of
the
sun
an
understanding
of
the
truth
regarding
supply
is
a
necessary
foundation
for
the
faith
without
which
the
planless
life
is
impossible
it
is
necessary
to
the
utter
falseness
and
unreality
of
poverty
and
lack
before
we
can
trust
in
divine
providence
or
the
working
of
spiritual
at
the
same
time
mental
law
it
is
necessary
to
know
that
the
universe
is
spiritual
that
god
is
spirit
in
whom
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
and
that
because
we
are
a
part
very
small
but
yet
a
part
of
the
whole
all
our
wants
all
through
the
ages
must
be
supplied
supply
sufficient
for
all
our
needs
is
the
reality
poverty
and
lack
the
product
of
lack
of
faith
of
fear
of
ignorance
of
weakness
of
character
have
their
origin
in
the
human
mind
and
are
the
unreality
the
negative
which
has
no
permanence
or
reality
when
we
have
learnt
the
truth
it
is
necessary
to
live
in
the
consciousness
of
it
and
to
think
and
act
and
praise
god
as
though
sufficiency
were
already
ours
not
to
spend
money
that
we
can
not
afford
to
spend
nor
to
incur
debt
but
to
live
mentally
in
an
atmosphere
of
abundant
supply
we
have
to
remember
that
the
change
in
consciousness
must
take
place
first
and
become
before
its
effects
can
be
seen
to
manifest
in
the
outer
life
the
entering
of
this
higher
consciousness
where
we
know
and
realize
the
truth
that
the
source
of
all
our
supply
is
spirit
and
that
the
divine
source
is
limitless
is
not
easy
although
it
is
less
difficult
to
some
than
to
others
it
demands
constant
mental
activity
and
watchfulness
it
requires
persistence
and
perseverance
in
right
thinking
yet
it
is
possible
to
those
who
are
in
earnest
by
living
in
the
consciousness
of
god
supply
and
exercising
a
lively
faith
the
life
becomes
affected
principally
due
to
both
conscious
and
unconscious
change
of
action
having
dealt
with
the
esoteric
or
inner
side
of
the
subject
of
supply
i
will
now
treat
it
more
from
the
outer
or
practical
side
the
latter
being
of
course
just
as
important
as
the
former
the
teaching
of
this
chapter
does
not
discourage
industry
and
thrift
far
from
it
after
the
lord
christ
had
fed
the
five
thousand
all
the
leavings
were
carefully
collected
so
that
nothing
should
be
wasted
this
is
in
accord
with
universal
law
there
is
a
law
of
economy
both
in
the
natural
and
spiritual
worlds
nature
appears
on
the
surface
to
be
very
wasteful
and
prodigal
but
actually
she
never
wastes
anything
if
it
can
be
avoided
therefore
the
action
of
the
disciples
was
in
accord
with
universal
law
what
a
lesson
for
us
to
be
careful
and
saving
is
a
mark
of
superiority
both
in
mind
and
character
the
wastefulness
of
the
helpless
poor
is
notorious
those
who
are
well
to
do
are
far
more
careful
and
conserving
than
the
very
poor
there
are
exceptions
it
is
true
but
the
rule
is
that
a
man
who
can
not
save
money
has
not
it
in
him
to
command
success
in
life
inability
to
deny
himself
certain
things
shows
a
weakness
of
character
and
lack
of
purpose
which
make
success
impossible
two
men
that
i
knew
very
well
built
fortunes
upon
which
they
saved
out
of
meagre
earnings
it
is
always
the
start
that
is
difficult
if
you
can
not
overcome
the
preliminary
difficulties
you
have
not
the
steadfast
purpose
to
hold
your
own
in
the
battle
of
life
on
the
other
hand
once
the
initial
difficulties
have
been
overcome
it
is
not
difficult
to
get
your
barque
into
the
currents
of
prosperity
when
once
you
realize
that
there
is
unlimited
abundance
in
which
you
can
share
when
once
you
learn
to
live
in
the
consciousness
of
this
abundance
at
the
same
time
living
within
your
present
income
and
doing
your
present
work
as
well
as
it
is
possible
for
it
to
be
done
you
have
set
out
on
the
path
to
affluence
one
who
realizes
and
really
believes
that
there
is
abundance
and
plenty
for
puts
into
operation
a
powerful
law
which
will
surely
bring
opportunity
to
him
sooner
or
later
many
however
ruin
their
hopes
by
not
knowing
that
for
a
time
they
must
live
a
kind
of
double
life
they
must
be
opulent
in
consciousness
but
careful
and
thrifty
in
actual
practice
the
time
will
come
when
their
means
will
largely
increase
then
if
they
are
wise
they
will
live
on
part
of
their
income
instead
of
living
up
to
it
this
will
give
them
a
wide
margin
for
charitable
purposes
for
the
taking
up
of
further
opportunities
and
for
extensions
many
business
men
have
to
let
golden
opportunities
pass
simply
because
they
have
saved
little
or
nothing
owing
to
lavish
private
expenditure
or
they
have
to
let
other
people
in
to
share
their
schemes
who
in
addition
to
taking
a
large
share
of
the
profits
may
prove
a
serious
handicap
and
hindrance
in
other
ways
while
in
its
essence
the
source
of
supply
is
spiritual
it
comes
to
us
through
material
channels
and
in
order
to
have
a
share
in
it
it
is
necessary
to
earn
it
we
have
to
give
something
in
exchange
for
what
we
draw
from
life
in
the
way
of
supply
we
must
give
in
order
to
receive
and
what
we
give
must
be
something
that
the
world
wants
or
needs
the
secret
of
supply
is
then
to
realize
that
there
is
unlimited
abundance
and
to
live
in
the
consciousness
of
it
as
completely
as
though
no
material
channels
existed
and
at
the
same
time
to
work
as
zealously
and
be
as
careful
as
though
there
were
no
such
thing
as
spiritual
supply
at
the
same
time
we
must
give
the
world
something
that
it
wants
or
otherwise
serve
in
some
useful
capacity
exercising
honesty
probity
and
justice
in
all
our
affairs
it
is
folly
to
expect
abundance
to
drop
in
our
lap
it
must
be
earned
by
intelligent
and
faithful
service
this
subject
is
treated
fully
in
the
fundamentals
of
true
success
by
the
same
author
published
by
the
science
of
thought
press
chichester
being
a
retired
business
man
who
started
life
with
nothing
not
even
good
health
i
have
looked
at
this
subject
from
a
business
man
point
of
view
the
principle
applies
however
to
every
walk
in
life
and
each
reader
can
adapt
the
teaching
of
this
lesson
to
his
or
her
particular
needs
chapter
viii
the
powers
and
limitations
of
the
mind
the
mind
is
the
mind
of
nature
it
possesses
extraordinary
powers
and
intelligence
but
no
inspiration
it
is
instinctive
it
is
animal
it
is
natural
but
there
is
nothing
about
it
it
is
of
the
earth
and
the
physical
plane
it
can
be
described
as
the
inner
forces
of
nature
resident
within
our
body
having
said
this
we
have
said
nearly
all
there
is
to
be
said
about
the
yet
this
is
the
mind
of
which
some
people
have
made
a
veritable
god
the
mind
if
led
aright
is
a
very
good
friend
reducing
all
repeated
thoughts
and
actions
into
habit
which
in
time
become
settled
and
part
of
the
very
life
itself
thus
by
conscious
right
thinking
and
conscious
right
action
a
good
habit
is
formed
which
becomes
in
course
of
time
practically
automatic
this
of
course
builds
up
the
character
which
in
turn
affects
the
life
it
will
be
seen
then
how
important
is
the
right
use
of
this
willing
and
faithful
servant
it
is
no
god
it
has
no
inspiration
but
it
is
a
very
useful
servant
as
we
shall
see
most
of
our
actions
or
movements
are
done
or
made
the
reason
that
practice
makes
perfect
is
that
the
mind
learns
to
do
the
task
and
by
so
doing
takes
it
off
our
hands
how
difficult
it
is
to
learn
to
drive
a
how
carefully
at
first
we
have
to
double
and
obtain
the
right
engine
speed
for
a
noiseless
change
yet
after
a
time
the
whole
action
is
performed
it
is
the
same
with
pianoforte
playing
many
players
some
better
than
others
can
play
the
most
difficult
classical
music
without
recalling
it
to
mind
as
soon
as
they
to
the
whole
piece
leaves
them
but
as
long
as
they
leave
the
whole
matter
to
the
which
never
forgets
they
can
keep
on
playing
i
and
my
conscious
mind
are
not
doing
much
of
the
actual
writing
of
this
book
we
think
the
thoughts
and
have
something
to
do
with
the
formation
of
the
sentences
but
the
mind
writes
them
down
if
i
had
to
think
of
each
word
and
letter
my
task
would
be
hopeless
and
i
should
become
half
dead
with
fatigue
the
mind
however
is
even
more
helpful
for
it
does
the
bulk
of
our
thinking
and
can
be
taught
to
do
a
great
deal
more
if
we
had
to
think
everything
out
laboriously
according
to
the
laws
of
logic
life
would
be
unbearable
instead
of
this
our
mind
does
the
bulk
or
our
thinking
and
if
we
give
it
a
chance
will
do
it
in
an
extremely
accurate
manner
strictly
according
to
the
laws
of
logic
and
the
slightest
the
more
that
we
train
the
to
do
our
ordinary
thinking
for
us
the
less
we
suffer
from
fatigue
fatigue
is
unknown
to
the
mind
therefore
we
can
never
tire
it
or
overwork
it
the
mind
can
be
made
to
do
more
and
more
work
for
us
if
we
will
delegate
definite
work
for
it
to
deal
with
one
who
has
learnt
thought
control
who
can
take
up
a
matter
consider
it
in
all
its
bearings
and
then
dismiss
the
subject
from
his
conscious
thought
is
able
to
increase
his
efficiency
a
hundred
per
and
reduce
his
mental
fatigue
almost
to
vanishing
point
instead
of
laboriously
working
out
his
problems
and
worrying
and
scheming
over
them
he
simply
dismisses
them
to
his
mind
to
be
dealt
with
by
a
master
mind
which
works
unceasingly
with
great
rapidity
extreme
accuracy
and
entirely
without
effort
it
is
necessary
however
to
give
the
every
available
information
for
it
possesses
no
inspiration
or
wisdom
but
works
out
logically
according
to
the
facts
supplied
to
it
this
great
natural
untiring
mind
downstairs
as
it
has
been
called
is
also
capable
of
doing
even
more
useful
work
still
a
writer
or
speaker
or
preacher
can
collect
notes
and
ideas
for
his
article
book
speech
or
sermon
and
pass
them
down
to
his
mind
with
orders
that
they
be
arranged
in
suitable
order
division
and
so
on
when
he
comes
either
to
write
or
prepare
the
notes
of
his
speech
or
sermon
he
will
find
all
the
work
done
for
him
and
all
that
he
has
to
do
is
to
write
it
down
entirely
without
effort
or
fatigue
again
a
business
man
who
has
learnt
to
make
use
of
his
mind
in
this
way
need
not
juggle
or
worry
or
fatigue
himself
by
planning
and
scheming
for
the
future
all
that
he
need
do
is
to
submit
the
facts
to
the
greater
mind
downstairs
and
all
the
planning
will
be
done
for
him
entirely
without
effort
and
far
more
efficiently
than
he
would
have
done
it
through
laborious
conscious
thinking
the
following
which
has
just
been
brought
to
my
notice
is
a
striking
confirmation
of
the
teaching
of
this
chapter
in
a
recent
issue
of
an
interview
with
henry
ford
appeared
he
spoke
of
the
way
with
which
big
business
men
deal
with
problems
and
pointed
out
that
they
did
not
spend
a
lot
of
time
pondering
and
puzzling
over
plans
or
ideas
he
said
an
idea
comes
to
us
we
think
of
it
for
a
little
while
and
then
put
it
in
the
pot
to
we
let
it
simmer
for
a
time
and
then
take
it
out
what
henry
ford
means
of
course
is
precisely
what
we
have
been
saying
that
the
idea
or
problem
is
dismissed
to
the
mind
which
works
it
out
and
presents
it
to
the
conscious
mind
for
judgment
yet
again
an
inventor
or
one
who
is
constructing
something
mechanical
can
make
use
of
the
mind
in
precisely
the
same
way
let
him
sum
up
the
whole
problem
arrange
all
his
facts
and
available
information
and
pass
them
all
to
his
mind
when
if
a
successful
result
is
within
the
range
of
possibility
an
answer
or
idea
will
be
forthcoming
all
this
being
done
mark
you
without
any
effort
whatever
all
this
may
seem
especially
to
some
readers
rather
wonderful
and
yet
there
is
nothing
occult
or
mysterious
about
it
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
there
is
no
great
writer
politician
or
business
man
who
does
not
make
use
of
his
mind
in
this
way
he
probably
does
so
unconsciously
but
his
procedure
is
the
same
some
employ
the
whole
of
their
mind
naturally
these
become
men
of
achievement
who
occupy
responsible
positions
and
who
bear
immense
burdens
without
strain
worry
or
care
responsibility
sits
lightly
upon
them
and
they
are
serene
and
untroubled
when
in
positions
and
when
confronted
by
tasks
and
difficulties
such
as
would
drive
an
ordinary
individual
out
of
his
mind
such
men
develop
their
powers
of
attention
and
concentration
anyone
who
is
in
earnest
can
do
this
to
a
very
high
degree
they
are
at
great
pains
to
get
to
the
root
of
a
problem
and
obtain
all
the
available
data
possible
but
after
that
it
is
their
mind
that
does
all
the
work
and
which
arrives
at
a
decision
while
it
comes
natural
to
a
few
to
use
their
mind
in
the
correct
way
the
majority
of
people
find
themselves
unable
to
do
so
such
however
can
acquire
the
art
by
training
first
it
is
necessary
to
learn
so
as
to
be
able
to
take
up
a
problem
or
dismiss
it
entirely
from
the
mind
when
a
problem
is
passed
on
to
the
to
be
worked
out
the
subject
must
be
dismissed
entirely
from
the
conscious
mind
the
problem
must
not
be
worried
over
nor
the
thoughts
allowed
to
dwell
upon
it
it
must
be
left
entirely
to
the
second
every
possible
detail
and
information
connected
with
the
problem
must
be
grasped
by
the
conscious
mind
and
the
whole
matter
pro
and
con
visualized
before
being
passed
to
the
it
will
be
seen
then
that
of
a
high
order
is
necessary
also
powers
of
attention
and
concentration
these
can
all
be
developed
by
anyone
who
is
really
in
earnest
a
good
way
of
starting
the
use
of
the
mind
is
to
hold
the
problem
in
the
mind
just
as
one
is
going
to
sleep
there
must
not
upon
any
account
be
any
attempt
made
to
solve
the
problem
or
to
worry
over
it
instead
the
main
facts
of
the
case
on
both
sides
must
be
marshalled
and
the
case
presented
to
the
mind
in
much
the
same
way
as
you
would
place
it
before
your
lawyer
having
done
this
dismiss
the
whole
matter
to
your
mind
and
in
most
cases
you
will
find
in
the
morning
that
a
solution
has
been
arrived
at
without
any
effort
or
fatigue
on
your
part
this
of
course
is
only
one
of
the
many
ways
in
which
the
mind
can
and
does
serve
its
master
or
the
one
who
should
be
master
this
great
invisible
force
of
nature
is
for
ever
working
whatever
ideal
is
held
in
the
mind
becomes
woven
into
the
life
through
the
tireless
working
of
the
mind
only
set
your
attention
upon
high
and
lofty
achievement
and
you
will
focus
all
the
invisible
inward
forces
of
nature
upon
its
accomplishment
in
course
of
time
you
will
reap
as
you
sow
if
you
will
direct
your
attention
into
the
right
channel
backing
it
up
with
energetic
conscious
action
your
will
help
you
day
and
night
thus
making
success
and
achievement
possible
chapter
ix
the
use
of
the
spiritual
or
mind
we
have
already
seen
that
the
mind
wonderful
though
it
be
is
instinctive
merely
lacking
inspiration
and
what
we
call
originality
all
inspiration
comes
from
the
universal
mind
via
the
all
poets
and
inspired
writers
get
their
inspiration
in
this
way
this
higher
mind
is
not
recognized
by
psychologists
but
it
has
long
been
known
to
searchers
for
spiritual
truth
what
we
get
from
the
is
the
outcome
of
facts
and
knowledge
supplied
to
it
what
we
get
from
the
is
direct
inspiration
from
higher
planes
this
higher
mind
might
also
be
called
the
mind
of
illumination
for
those
who
can
enter
into
it
become
illumined
being
able
to
know
the
truth
and
to
see
things
as
they
really
are
and
not
as
they
falsely
appear
to
the
senses
this
limited
consciousness
in
which
we
live
is
bounded
by
our
five
senses
the
universe
that
we
see
around
us
is
partly
real
and
partly
an
illusion
the
real
universe
is
spiritual
and
infinite
what
we
sense
is
a
limited
partial
conception
of
a
fragment
of
it
our
limited
finite
conception
of
the
universe
is
entirely
misleading
and
erroneous
and
so
long
as
we
rely
on
sense
evidence
and
the
human
mind
we
remain
in
darkness
and
uncertainty
when
however
we
can
rise
into
the
realm
our
consciousness
expands
transcending
the
senses
and
the
limitations
of
the
physical
plane
the
spiritual
mind
is
of
course
only
accessible
to
those
who
are
more
delicately
attuned
to
its
finer
vibrations
nothing
that
is
worth
having
can
be
had
without
effort
and
it
is
only
after
much
that
it
becomes
possible
for
the
student
to
raise
his
consciousness
to
this
higher
realm
and
understand
life
from
the
standpoint
of
the
universal
mind
there
is
nothing
either
mystical
or
psychical
about
the
use
of
this
higher
mind
one
who
makes
use
of
it
becomes
that
is
all
he
does
not
go
into
trances
nor
need
he
become
clairvoyant
he
simply
remains
a
sane
normal
individual
with
this
difference
only
he
makes
use
of
more
of
his
mind
than
does
the
ordinary
individual
one
who
is
able
to
use
this
higher
mind
develops
that
which
has
been
termed
the
divine
quality
of
originality
if
ever
a
person
is
to
rise
above
the
dead
level
of
mediocrity
it
must
be
through
direct
inspiration
from
higher
planes
through
his
mind
if
ever
a
person
is
to
bring
forth
a
new
idea
which
shall
enrich
humanity
and
add
to
the
common
good
it
must
come
through
the
higher
mind
one
who
is
properly
attuned
becomes
through
the
mind
a
recipient
of
knowledge
that
is
above
human
and
wisdom
that
is
divine
he
knows
by
direct
knowing
he
becomes
wise
through
an
influx
of
divine
wisdom
he
is
able
to
distinguish
between
the
real
and
the
sham
between
the
gold
and
the
dross
he
is
also
able
to
see
and
recognize
the
right
path
in
life
a
thing
utterly
impossible
to
the
mind
of
the
senses
and
to
tread
it
thus
being
led
into
the
only
true
success
and
real
good
of
which
his
life
is
capable
let
it
be
said
here
that
all
wisdom
must
come
from
within
while
books
and
the
written
word
may
be
helpful
it
is
the
spirit
within
the
reader
that
illumines
the
word
and
makes
it
real
and
true
to
the
seeker
after
wisdom
one
who
realizes
that
he
is
illumined
within
by
the
divine
spirit
and
that
this
alone
can
bring
him
into
real
knowledge
is
well
advanced
on
the
path
that
leads
to
realization
the
wisdom
of
the
human
mind
always
leads
to
disappointment
it
is
based
on
the
evidence
of
the
senses
which
is
erroneous
therefore
its
findings
must
always
be
lacking
in
wisdom
one
who
relies
upon
the
inspiration
of
divine
wisdom
has
often
to
decide
to
take
a
course
of
action
which
apparently
is
opposed
to
his
best
interests
yet
if
he
follows
the
inward
wisdom
he
finds
that
he
is
always
guided
aright
and
later
has
cause
to
be
devoutly
thankful
that
he
followed
the
gleam
chapter
x
character
building
and
the
overcoming
of
habit
character
building
is
the
greatest
object
in
life
it
has
been
said
that
character
is
the
only
thing
we
can
take
with
us
when
we
depart
this
life
this
is
perfectly
true
therefore
the
object
of
all
religion
not
religiousness
mental
training
and
development
should
be
the
building
of
character
a
religion
that
does
not
build
up
character
is
worthless
those
who
think
that
they
can
flop
through
life
avoid
as
far
as
possible
its
discipline
make
no
effort
to
improve
their
character
and
through
believing
in
a
certain
creed
can
miraculously
become
perfect
simply
by
dying
are
deceiving
themselves
we
do
not
become
perfect
of
a
strong
and
perfect
character
either
by
believing
in
a
creed
or
through
dying
but
by
attainment
god
helps
those
who
help
themselves
and
those
people
who
will
not
strive
after
better
things
cut
themselves
off
from
all
the
glorious
and
wonderful
possibilities
of
attainment
before
however
thinking
about
such
lofty
things
as
entering
the
path
of
attainment
and
becoming
changed
into
and
modelled
after
the
divine
image
the
average
person
may
wish
to
know
how
to
overcome
bad
habits
and
weaknesses
of
character
which
are
keeping
him
down
in
life
and
possibly
undermining
his
health
most
people
are
conscious
of
some
wrong
habits
that
ought
to
be
overcome
and
weaknesses
of
character
which
should
be
eradicated
possibly
they
have
fought
against
their
habits
or
weaknesses
for
years
prayed
until
they
are
tired
of
praying
made
innumerable
attempts
at
turning
over
a
new
leaf
yet
all
in
vain
for
they
are
as
firmly
in
the
toils
as
ever
many
people
give
up
the
struggle
and
endeavour
to
lead
a
sort
of
jekyll
and
hyde
existence
being
outwardly
a
christian
or
righteous
person
but
inwardly
something
quite
different
yet
they
find
no
satisfaction
in
this
dual
life
for
they
know
that
they
are
drifting
towards
an
abyss
yet
there
is
a
way
of
escape
that
is
open
to
all
the
infinite
one
has
provided
man
with
powers
that
are
apparently
unlimited
powers
which
can
be
used
either
to
build
up
the
life
and
character
or
to
destroy
them
these
powers
are
those
of
the
mind
this
mind
is
a
reservoir
of
unlimited
tireless
forces
and
becomes
if
we
use
it
aright
our
best
friend
or
if
we
it
our
worst
enemy
every
time
a
bad
action
is
indulged
in
wonderful
changes
take
place
in
the
nervous
system
and
energy
becomes
stored
up
in
certain
cells
so
as
to
make
it
easier
to
do
the
wrong
act
on
a
future
occasion
it
is
equally
true
that
every
time
a
good
action
is
done
similar
changes
but
in
a
reverse
direction
take
place
that
make
the
doing
of
the
same
action
easier
in
the
future
this
explains
the
tremendous
power
of
habit
our
body
brain
and
nervous
system
become
changed
either
for
the
worse
or
the
better
according
to
the
type
of
action
indulged
in
we
do
not
yet
fully
realize
what
a
wonderful
adventure
life
is
we
are
entrusted
with
tremendous
powers
and
by
their
use
or
we
can
either
destroy
ourselves
or
build
up
our
character
in
every
possible
direction
what
a
responsibility
yet
what
a
glorious
opportunity
in
order
however
to
find
a
way
of
escape
from
evil
habit
and
weaknesses
of
character
we
must
go
deeper
than
actual
deeds
for
actions
are
effects
of
hidden
causes
the
cause
of
all
action
is
thought
a
thought
someone
has
said
is
an
action
in
the
process
of
being
born
it
is
true
that
we
possess
primitive
desires
and
impulses
but
these
can
be
transmuted
into
noble
actions
and
high
achievement
simply
by
directing
the
thoughts
and
attention
to
higher
and
better
things
for
instance
the
powers
of
sex
become
transmuted
into
brain
power
if
the
thoughts
and
attention
are
completely
transferred
from
sex
to
intellectual
pursuits
if
however
the
thoughts
are
allowed
to
dwell
upon
sex
or
passion
then
the
kingdom
becomes
divided
against
itself
and
man
begins
to
drift
towards
the
abyss
the
strain
of
modern
life
is
filling
our
asylums
yet
there
are
those
who
can
work
fifteen
or
even
eighteen
hours
a
day
and
thrive
on
it
although
engaged
in
brain
work
these
have
learnt
to
transmute
their
lower
powers
into
higher
this
is
not
done
by
means
of
esoteric
or
occult
practices
but
by
obeying
the
divine
injunction
to
set
our
affections
on
things
above
in
other
words
to
keep
our
thoughts
and
attention
fixed
upon
higher
and
better
aims
ambitions
and
pursuits
it
is
impossible
to
overcome
bad
habits
by
fighting
them
for
the
more
we
fight
them
the
stronger
they
become
the
injunction
to
resist
not
evil
is
very
applicable
to
habit
the
way
of
escape
is
not
by
fighting
evil
or
wrong
habit
no
matter
what
its
character
may
be
but
by
concentrating
upon
building
a
good
habit
that
shall
cut
the
ground
from
under
the
feet
of
the
bad
one
or
by
turning
the
attention
to
higher
and
better
things
whatever
we
fix
our
attention
upon
or
whatever
it
is
that
we
idealize
our
mind
endeavours
to
actualize
and
make
real
in
our
life
by
fighting
a
habit
we
direct
attention
to
it
and
this
is
fatal
if
however
we
turn
our
whole
attention
to
something
entirely
different
and
which
is
higher
and
better
all
the
powers
of
the
are
directed
towards
the
production
in
the
life
and
body
of
the
new
object
of
attention
we
see
therefore
that
we
do
not
have
to
overcome
habit
if
we
did
our
task
would
be
hopeless
for
the
human
will
is
helpless
before
the
power
of
the
mind
the
powers
can
be
led
by
the
imagination
but
they
can
not
be
coerced
by
the
will
the
will
must
be
used
not
to
fight
the
habit
but
in
raising
and
directing
the
attention
to
something
higher
and
better
by
this
means
a
new
habit
is
formed
the
attention
of
the
mind
is
taken
away
from
the
bad
habit
and
all
its
powers
directed
towards
the
creation
of
a
new
and
better
one
the
does
not
care
what
the
habit
is
it
is
indifferent
as
to
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
it
is
just
as
willing
to
produce
a
good
habit
as
a
bad
one
we
each
of
us
therefore
hold
our
fate
in
our
own
hands
we
can
by
controlling
our
thoughts
and
imagination
and
by
directing
our
attention
to
better
things
focus
all
the
powers
of
the
on
the
building
up
of
good
habits
or
on
the
other
hand
we
can
by
allowing
our
thoughts
and
mental
pictures
to
dwell
upon
undesirable
things
and
our
attention
to
be
directed
to
low
or
weak
ideals
fall
into
undesirable
habits
the
power
that
produces
the
habits
is
the
same
in
each
case
it
is
the
way
in
which
this
power
is
directed
that
is
the
vital
and
essential
thing
it
is
very
necessary
to
point
out
that
right
thinking
and
correct
use
of
the
imagination
must
be
accompanied
by
corresponding
right
action
many
people
make
use
of
and
expect
it
to
destroy
their
bad
habits
and
build
up
better
ones
but
it
never
will
or
can
do
so
unaided
is
useless
if
it
is
not
followed
by
constructive
action
young
people
should
expend
their
energies
in
physical
culture
and
games
older
people
should
interest
themselves
in
hobbies
and
intellectual
pursuits
it
is
only
advanced
students
who
can
control
their
thoughts
so
that
they
can
govern
their
life
forces
by
mental
means
those
less
advanced
when
attacked
by
evil
or
weak
thoughts
must
get
up
and
something
quite
different
and
thus
get
their
minds
off
the
forbidden
subject
and
interested
in
the
new
object
of
attention
it
is
a
case
of
directing
the
desires
and
life
forces
into
different
channels
by
controlling
the
thoughts
and
attention
here
is
seen
the
value
of
true
religion
for
it
brings
fresh
ideals
into
the
life
and
directs
the
attention
to
higher
and
better
things
the
writer
realizes
that
a
change
must
take
place
in
the
heart
of
the
individual
before
he
can
desire
these
better
things
when
however
this
change
has
taken
place
the
battle
has
only
just
begun
for
each
one
has
to
work
out
his
own
salvation
at
first
then
most
people
will
find
it
necessary
to
do
something
in
order
to
attract
their
attention
and
guide
their
thoughts
to
something
quite
different
from
the
forbidden
subject
later
on
however
when
they
become
more
advanced
in
the
science
of
right
thinking
they
will
be
able
to
direct
their
thoughts
into
any
desired
direction
this
necessitates
constant
vigilance
each
thought
has
to
be
carefully
scrutinized
before
being
allowed
to
pass
the
threshold
of
the
mind
by
reversing
every
negative
or
unworthy
or
ignoble
thought
into
its
opposite
a
change
is
wrought
in
the
brain
and
nervous
system
the
cells
formerly
used
for
wrong
thinking
and
for
the
production
of
wrong
action
go
out
of
use
as
new
cells
are
brought
into
use
for
the
production
of
right
action
this
stage
leads
to
one
higher
still
when
it
becomes
a
settled
habit
to
reverse
bad
thoughts
into
good
ones
and
perform
right
actions
instead
of
bad
or
weak
ones
the
power
of
the
mind
which
at
one
time
seemed
so
evil
produces
right
action
more
or
less
automatically
when
once
the
habit
of
cleaning
the
teeth
is
established
there
is
experienced
an
uncomfortable
feeling
until
they
have
been
attended
to
when
once
a
dirty
person
has
learnt
to
wash
himself
thoroughly
and
keep
himself
decent
he
will
feel
uncomfortable
if
he
gets
dirty
the
same
rule
applies
in
the
more
important
things
and
habits
of
life
if
those
who
are
in
the
bondage
of
habit
will
only
direct
their
thoughts
and
attention
to
the
building
up
of
good
habits
their
old
weaknesses
will
die
a
natural
death
it
must
not
be
thought
that
the
victory
over
habits
is
easy
it
may
seem
so
at
first
but
sooner
or
later
temptation
will
come
with
added
force
which
may
result
in
a
sad
fall
if
this
should
happen
it
is
most
important
that
too
much
attention
should
not
be
paid
to
the
incident
instead
the
beginner
should
pick
himself
up
and
making
a
mental
note
of
the
immediate
cause
of
his
downfall
thus
benefiting
by
the
experience
press
on
again
towards
freedom
it
is
most
helpful
to
realize
that
not
only
is
the
mind
willing
to
be
guided
aright
if
we
will
only
persevere
long
enough
until
persevering
itself
becomes
a
habit
but
that
we
also
have
behind
us
all
the
spiritual
powers
of
god
the
infinite
one
sees
to
it
that
the
odds
are
not
overwhelmingly
against
us
our
difficulties
are
not
insuperable
although
they
may
appear
to
be
so
we
can
always
win
through
if
we
faint
not
heaven
looks
on
with
sympathetic
interest
and
rejoices
with
the
struggler
when
he
succeeds
and
mourns
with
him
when
he
fails
the
struggle
is
a
stiff
one
for
it
is
only
by
this
that
the
seeker
after
god
can
become
strong
in
character
but
the
victory
can
always
be
won
when
the
situation
appears
hopeless
let
the
struggling
one
remember
that
there
is
a
way
of
escape
somewhere
and
that
god
who
is
his
freedom
and
deliverer
will
reveal
it
to
him
if
he
faints
not
if
all
who
seek
deliverance
will
realize
that
the
power
of
the
infinite
is
on
their
side
and
that
they
are
bound
to
become
victors
if
they
will
only
keep
on
they
must
succeed
and
what
a
joy
is
theirs
there
is
no
happiness
quite
like
that
which
comes
to
one
who
has
fought
the
good
fight
and
overcome
habit
and
weaknesses
of
character
may
every
reader
experience
this
supreme
joy
of

xi
happiness
and
joy
deep
down
in
every
heart
is
an
unquenchable
desire
for
happiness
the
advanced
soul
desires
happiness
just
as
much
as
the
worldling
the
difference
between
them
is
simply
that
the
former
through
knowledge
and
experience
does
not
search
for
happiness
knowing
that
it
can
never
be
found
by
direct
seeking
but
finds
it
through
service
and
love
to
others
and
in
victory
over
self
while
the
latter
seeks
happiness
like
a
in
every
form
of
pleasure
and
finds
it
not
man
is
never
satisfied
with
his
life
he
is
for
ever
seeking
something
that
is
better
until
he
learns
wisdom
he
looks
for
it
in
pleasure
in
sense
gratification
of
various
kinds
in
wealth
luxury
and
possession
the
less
evolved
a
man
is
the
more
convinced
he
is
that
happiness
can
be
gained
in
these
ways
and
the
lower
are
his
desires
for
instance
those
who
form
what
is
called
the
underworld
of
our
cities
seek
happiness
in
vice
and
debauchery
those
who
are
more
evolved
seek
pleasure
in
more
refined
things
hoping
to
find
happiness
in
intellectual
pursuits
friendships
and
in
pure
human
loves
these
more
evolved
types
get
much
more
pleasure
through
the
senses
than
do
those
who
are
more
elemental
but
they
are
capable
also
of
greater
and
more
acute
suffering
they
can
derive
great
pleasure
from
a
picture
gallery
whereas
a
savage
would
see
nothing
interesting
at
all
they
can
also
suffer
from
things
which
a
savage
would
not
be
capable
of
feeling
yet
in
spite
of
this
developed
refinement
and
ability
to
derive
pleasure
from
art
science
literature
happiness
is
still
as
far
off
as
ever
all
attempts
at
finding
happiness
lead
finally
to
emptiness
there
is
no
satisfaction
either
in
wealth
and
all
that
it
can
command
getting
on
in
life
or
in
fame
and
power
they
allure
at
first
and
promise
happiness
but
they
fail
us
and
finally
are
seen
to
be
but
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
this
desire
for
happiness
is
good
for
it
leads
us
through
innumerable
experiences
so
that
the
soul
can
realize
by
practical
experience
the
emptiness
of
all
and
thus
learn
wisdom
after
running
the
whole
gamut
of
experience
the
soul
learns
at
last
that
happiness
is
not
something
that
can
be
found
by
seeking
it
but
is
an
inward
mental
state
although
work
well
done
brings
a
quiet
sense
of
satisfaction
and
success
in
one
career
may
also
be
a
source
of
gratification
for
a
short
time
yet
even
these
can
not
satisfy
the
deep
longing
of
the
soul
happiness
however
is
to
be
found
in
service
not
if
we
seek
happiness
in
service
and
serve
in
order
to
be
happy
but
if
we
serve
others
for
the
sake
of
serving
we
find
the
only
happiness
that
will
endure
and
satisfy
one
has
only
to
observe
the
lives
of
those
who
are
always
selfishly
seeking
and
grabbing
who
are
hard
in
their
dealings
and
always
looking
after
number
one
in
order
to
see
how
impossible
it
is
for
to
be
happy
it
does
not
matter
whether
they
acquire
riches
or
remain
poor
they
are
equally
unhappy
in
contrast
to
this
you
have
only
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
do
a
kind
and
perfectly
disinterested
action
and
experience
the
glow
of
sheer
happiness
that
it
brings
in
order
to
realize
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
law
of
life
that
is
as
sure
and
unalterable
as
the
law
of
gravitation
there
must
be
a
purpose
in
life
and
this
must
have
for
its
object
the
betterment
of
the
lives
of
others
either
few
or
many
the
law
of
service
must
be
obeyed
otherwise
there
can
be
no
happiness
this
may
fill
some
readers
with
dismay
for
they
may
be
employed
in
an
occupation
that
apparently
does
no
good
to
anybody
they
may
feel
that
if
they
were
engaged
in
some
noble
enterprise
for
the
uplift
of
humanity
then
they
could
truly
serve
but
in
their
present
occupation
this
is
impossible
to
think
thus
is
very
natural
yet
the
truth
is
we
can
all
obey
the
law
of
service
and
can
begin
now
in
our
present
occupation
no
matter
what
it
may
be
we
have
only
to
do
our
daily
work
not
as
a
task
which
must
be
got
through
in
order
to
bring
us
a
living
or
because
it
is
expected
of
us
that
we
should
work
but
as
an
offering
of
love
to
life
and
the
world
in
order
to
come
into
harmony
with
the
great
law
of
service
our
ideas
of
values
with
regard
to
occupations
are
altogether
erroneous
from
the
inner
wisdom
point
of
view
the
scrubbing
of
a
doorstep
if
faithfully
done
in
a
true
spirit
of
service
is
of
as
much
value
and
real
importance
as
the
writing
of
a
deathless
poem
or
dying
for
country
we
can
never
truthfully
say
that
one
act
of
service
is
of
greater
value
or
is
more
important
than
another
all
that
the
higher
law
looks
at
is
the
therefore
if
your
motive
is
right
you
can
be
engaged
in
the
humblest
and
apparently
most
useless
occupation
and
yet
be
happy
because
you
satisfy
the
law
of
service
another
road
to
happiness
is
the
conquest
of
the
lower
nature
the
overcoming
of
weaknesses
the
climbing
to
higher
and
better
things
there
is
intense
happiness
in
realizing
daily
that
old
habits
are
being
overthrown
weak
points
in
the
character
built
up
and
an
state
of
liberty
and
freedom
entered
into
thank
god
we
do
not
have
to
remain
as
we
once
were
but
can
progress
upwards
indefinitely
for
there
is
no
limit
to
our
upward
climb
but
there
is
a
state
that
is
far
higher
than
happiness
and
this
is
joy
happiness
comes
through
service
and
overcoming
but
joy
comes
only
to
one
who
realizes
his
oneness
with
his
divine
source
the
is
ineffable
joy
behind
this
world
of
shadows
is
the
real
spiritual
world
of
splendour
and
delight
when
the
soul
after
its
immense
journey
through
matter
time
and
space
at
last
finds
its
way
back
to
its
divine
source
it
becomes
aware
of
this
intense
joy
too
great
to
be
described
in
words
it
not
only
realizes
that
the
is
joy
and
the
universe
filled
not
with
groans
or
sighing
but
with
the
sweet
quiet
laughter
of
freed
souls
it
also
is
filled
itself
with
this
ineffable
joy
what
has
all
this
got
to
do
with
practical
everyday
life
it
may
be
asked
everything
for
the
one
who
possesses
this
quiet
joy
can
never
be
defeated
in
life
battles
he
has
something
within
him
that
can
never
be
quenched
and
which
will
lead
him
from
victory
to
victory
chapter
xii
the
use
and
of
mental
and
spiritual
powers
the
average
individual
knows
nothing
of
mental
forces
and
although
he
may
suffer
from
the
effects
of
unconscious
wrong
thinking
yet
he
is
in
no
danger
of
making
deliberate
of
the
inner
powers
one
however
who
has
learnt
how
to
use
these
interior
forces
must
be
very
careful
to
use
them
aright
or
he
will
find
that
the
invisible
powers
of
mind
and
spirit
are
far
more
powerful
and
destructive
than
dynamite
it
is
not
meant
by
this
that
he
can
blow
himself
up
thereby
but
it
does
mean
that
he
can
injure
himself
not
only
in
this
life
but
for
ages
to
come
and
in
addition
seriously
retard
his
spiritual
evolution
all
use
of
the
mind
to
coerce
other
people
or
to
influence
them
by
means
of
suggestion
not
for
their
benefit
but
for
your
advantage
is
highly
destructive
not
to
them
actually
to
on
the
face
of
it
it
looks
an
easy
road
to
success
and
prosperity
but
actually
it
leads
to
failure
and
poverty
the
of
the
mental
powers
in
this
way
is
really
a
form
of
black
magic
and
the
fate
of
all
black
magicians
is
very
terrible
even
the
use
of
the
mind
to
coerce
other
people
their
is
not
desirable
it
never
does
any
real
good
although
it
may
seem
beneficial
for
a
time
and
its
use
therefore
is
to
be
deprecated
healing
by
is
not
permanent
for
as
soon
as
the
healer
ceases
to
pump
suggestion
into
the
patient
the
latter
begins
to
relapse
into
his
former
state
far
better
results
accrue
if
the
patient
is
taught
to
use
auto
or
for
himself
it
is
seen
then
that
the
use
of
the
mind
to
influence
others
is
distinctly
harmful
if
it
is
used
selfishly
and
of
no
real
use
if
used
unselfishly
hypnotism
is
harmful
no
matter
which
way
it
is
used
and
is
also
detrimental
to
the
patient
because
of
this
some
of
our
more
thoughtful
neurologists
have
given
up
its
use
we
have
no
right
to
endeavour
to
influence
other
people
by
the
use
of
our
inner
forces
even
if
our
object
is
their
good
each
soul
has
the
right
to
live
its
life
in
its
own
way
and
choose
for
itself
either
good
or
evil
that
is
the
object
of
life
so
that
each
evolving
soul
should
learn
wisdom
through
the
lessons
learnt
as
a
result
of
its
own
mistakes
far
worse
is
it
if
others
are
coerced
not
in
order
to
help
them
but
to
defraud
them
or
to
make
them
buy
goods
they
do
not
require
or
sign
agreements
they
would
not
otherwise
put
their
name
to
one
who
his
mental
and
spiritual
powers
literally
smashes
his
life
up
he
works
against
the
laws
of
life
and
the
universe
and
encompasses
his
own
ruin
there
is
however
a
far
more
subtle
way
of
the
mental
and
spiritual
forces
than
by
coercion
mind
domination
and
this
method
is
equally
destructive
and
if
persisted
in
builds
up
a
painful
future
with
this
method
other
people
are
not
influenced
or
dominated
but
the
finer
forces
of
nature
are
coerced
by
the
human
will
mental
demands
are
made
on
the
invisible
substance
from
which
we
are
told
all
things
are
made
and
wealth
is
compelled
to
appear
in
addition
to
this
sickness
so
it
is
claimed
is
banished
and
the
invisible
forces
of
life
are
compelled
to
operate
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
life
pathway
a
bed
of
roses
without
thorns
so
that
life
becomes
shorn
of
all
its
discipline
and
experience
its
devotees
enter
the
silence
and
there
visualize
exactly
what
they
think
they
want
and
compel
it
to
appear
in
material
form
by
the
strength
of
their
desire
or
through
the
exercise
of
their
will
some
followers
of
this
cult
may
be
able
to
make
an
apparent
success
of
it
but
i
have
never
yet
met
any
if
they
do
however
they
will
live
to
regret
it
for
they
are
merely
practitioners
of
black
magic
their
efforts
are
of
the
same
nature
as
sorcery
all
such
methods
build
up
a
heavy
debt
of
future
suffering
and
seriously
hinder
the
soul
in
its
evolutionary
journey
entering
the
silence
is
a
good
thing
it
is
really
entering
the
inner
silence
of
the
soul
the
inner
sanctuary
where
the
divine
spirit
abides
in
fulness
to
this
inward
power
for
selfish
and
material
ends
and
for
forcing
our
human
will
upon
life
so
as
to
make
it
conform
to
what
think
it
ought
to
be
is
a
crime
of
the
first
magnitude
which
can
result
only
in
ultimate
failure
and
disaster
chapter
xiii
overcoming
limitations
and
awakening
inward
powers
limitations
can
be
overcome
through
a
realization
of
truth
when
we
say
this
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
every
effort
will
be
made
on
the
physical
plane
it
is
necessary
to
bathe
exercise
and
breathe
fresh
air
in
order
to
be
well
it
is
equally
necessary
to
work
hard
and
to
give
the
best
of
which
we
are
capable
in
service
in
exchange
for
that
which
we
receive
in
the
way
of
supply
if
we
are
to
be
successful
if
you
keep
a
gardener
you
must
pay
him
the
money
that
you
pay
him
is
part
of
what
you
have
earned
by
the
sweat
of
your
brain
therefore
you
exchange
the
work
of
your
brain
for
the
labour
of
his
hands
and
you
are
mutually
helped
and
helpful
to
one
another
both
giving
and
receiving
and
each
one
serving
life
according
to
his
ability
taking
all
this
for
granted
we
will
pass
on
to
the
metaphysical
side
of
our
subject
this
by
the
way
is
vastly
the
more
important
but
the
outer
practical
work
is
indispensable
nevertheless
in
order
to
overcome
limitations
it
is
necessary
to
know
the
truth
and
to
live
in
the
consciousness
of
it
for
instance
if
is
our
limitation
then
in
order
to
become
free
it
is
necessary
that
we
live
in
the
consciousness
of
the
wholeness
of
god
and
his
divine
idea
if
our
limitation
be
restricted
means
it
is
necessary
that
we
live
in
the
consciousness
of
the
inexhaustible
and
unlimited
nature
of
the
substance
from
which
the
creator
brings
everything
into
manifestation
if
our
limitation
is
disharmony
and
unhappiness
then
we
must
become
attuned
to
the
divine
harmony
in
such
a
way
and
to
such
an
extent
as
to
cause
it
to
be
reflected
into
the
outward
life
no
matter
what
our
limitation
may
be
we
can
find
liberation
and
deliverance
by
looking
to
our
divine
source
realizing
that
in
the
perfect
reality
all
our
wants
are
supplied
and
then
living
in
the
consciousness
of
this
truth
is
apart
from
physical
causes
an
outward
sign
of
an
inward
warfare
or
disharmony
caused
by
wrong
thoughts
emotions
beliefs
and
attitude
of
mind
and
soul
towards
life
and
god
in
other
words
the
life
is
lived
in
an
error
consciousness
of
disease
and
sickness
first
the
inward
life
has
to
be
adjusted
in
such
a
way
as
to
harmonize
with
the
laws
of
our
own
being
and
the
divine
purpose
of
life
there
must
be
an
inward
surrender
to
the
love
principle
after
which
the
thoughts
must
be
brought
under
control
so
that
emotions
may
no
longer
impair
the
health
further
the
whole
consciousness
must
as
often
as
possible
be
raised
to
a
realization
of
the
perfect
wholeness
which
is
the
reality
if
this
course
is
persevered
with
a
consciousness
of
health
and
wholeness
becomes
a
permanent
mental
state
with
the
result
that
health
becomes
manifested
in
the
life
the
outward
life
is
always
a
reflection
or
external
manifestation
of
what
we
are
within
or
our
state
of
consciousness
therefore
everything
depends
upon
which
kind
of
consciousness
it
is
in
which
we
live
one
who
lives
in
the
mental
atmosphere
of
divine
wholeness
health
and
harmony
unconsciously
directs
all
the
inner
forces
of
nature
into
health
channels
on
the
other
hand
one
who
lives
in
a
mental
atmosphere
of
as
sick
and
unhealthy
people
very
often
do
unconsciously
directs
all
his
activities
in
such
a
way
as
to
produce
sickness
and
disease
again
with
regard
to
lack
of
means
this
state
also
can
be
overcome
spiritually
only
by
living
in
a
higher
consciousness
of
abundance
and
sufficiency
this
affects
unconsciously
every
action
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
about
a
better
state
of
affairs
on
the
other
hand
one
who
lives
in
a
mental
atmosphere
of
limitation
and
lack
unconsciously
directs
all
his
actions
towards
the
production
in
his
life
of
penury
and
restricted
means
the
same
rule
applies
no
matter
what
the
limitations
of
one
life
may
be
freedom
can
be
gained
only
by
realizing
the
truth
about
life
and
being
when
we
realize
the
truth
live
in
the
consciousness
of
it
and
become
obedient
to
the
laws
of
life
and
being
the
life
becomes
increasingly
free
this
does
not
mean
that
if
we
are
plain
of
feature
and
of
a
stumpy
figure
that
we
shall
become
beautiful
and
graceful
but
it
does
mean
that
these
drawbacks
will
no
longer
fetter
us
and
that
others
will
see
in
us
something
far
better
than
mere
regularity
of
feature
and
beauty
of
form
when
the
soul
is
and
the
life
filled
with
love
the
homeliest
face
becomes
attractive
neither
does
it
mean
that
we
shall
not
suffer
bereavements
and
sorrows
difficulties
and
adversities
but
it
does
mean
that
we
shall
cease
intensifying
these
things
and
creating
further
troubles
by
taking
life
discipline
in
the
wrong
spirit
it
also
means
that
we
shall
be
able
to
overcome
all
difficulties
and
trials
become
a
conqueror
in
the
strife
and
in
so
doing
build
up
character
thus
the
storms
of
life
instead
of
destroying
us
can
succeed
only
in
us
thus
our
fate
depends
not
on
the
storms
of
life
but
upon
how
we
meet
them
if
we
give
in
to
them
or
thinking
that
they
are
evil
and
not
a
necessary
discipline
rebel
against
them
and
resist
them
then
we
become
shipwrecked
on
a
desolate
shore
if
however
we
are
armed
with
the
knowledge
of
truth
we
can
set
our
sails
in
such
a
way
as
to
compel
the
storms
of
life
actually
to
help
us
towards
the
desired
haven
the
first
step
in
the
direction
of
knowledge
of
the
truth
is
right
thinking
every
negative
thought
must
be
transmuted
into
its
positive
opposite
for
instance
hate
and
dislike
into
love
and
goodwill
fear
into
confident
trust
poverty
into
abundance
evil
into
absolute
good
and
so
on
this
will
be
found
to
be
not
easy
but
it
is
possible
and
the
power
to
control
one
thoughts
increases
if
one
perseveres
continually
with
the
passing
of
the
years
a
beginner
can
not
naturally
expect
to
be
able
to
exercise
the
same
control
as
one
who
has
been
perseveringly
seeking
for
years
but
he
can
make
substantial
progress
and
learn
from
day
to
day
see
also
the
power
of
thought
and
the
way
of
escape
by
the
same
author
and
publisher
the
result
of
thinking
in
this
way
is
surprising
the
reversal
of
thought
may
appear
at
first
to
be
simplicity
itself
and
to
lead
nowhere
in
particular
but
after
a
time
the
vastness
of
the
subject
becomes
almost
appalling
the
cultivation
and
practice
of
right
thinking
gradually
lead
to
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
not
an
intellectual
knowledge
of
truth
but
a
realization
by
the
soul
of
truth
this
is
the
knowing
of
the
truth
which
sets
men
free
we
can
then
look
through
all
the
ages
and
know
that
all
is
well
the
heavy
burden
which
has
oppressed
us
so
long
rolls
from
our
shoulders
and
we
become
free
arousing
inward
powers
man
is
heir
to
wonderful
and
illimitable
powers
but
until
he
becomes
aware
of
them
and
consciously
identifies
himself
with
them
they
lie
dormant
and
unexpressed
and
might
just
as
well
not
exist
at
all
as
far
as
their
use
to
man
in
his
unawakened
state
is
concerned
when
however
man
becomes
awakened
to
the
great
truth
that
he
is
a
spiritual
being
when
he
learns
that
the
little
petty
self
and
finite
personality
are
not
his
real
self
at
all
but
merely
a
mask
to
the
real
man
when
he
realizes
that
the
spiritual
ego
a
true
divine
spark
of
or
branch
or
twig
of
the
eternal
logos
is
real
when
he
understands
that
his
body
is
not
himself
that
his
mind
is
not
himself
that
even
his
soul
is
not
himself
being
but
vehicles
through
which
he
seeks
expression
but
that
he
is
spirit
deathless
diseaseless
eternal
forming
an
integral
part
of
the
one
spirit
and
being
identical
with
it
he
enters
a
new
life
of
almost
boundless
power
i
am
the
vine
ye
are
the
jesus
it
is
unwise
to
engage
in
any
mystical
practices
in
an
attempt
to
force
development
and
unfoldment
mystic
trances
are
highly
dangerous
and
are
also
unnecessary
psychic
experiences
and
the
awakening
of
psychic
centres
are
also
dangerous
and
lead
away
from
our
goal
breathing
exercises
whose
object
is
to
awaken
inward
powers
are
and
are
to
be
condemned
in
consequence
the
cultivation
of
negative
passivity
such
as
inhibiting
all
thought
and
making
oneself
quite
passive
and
open
to
any
influence
is
also
highly
dangerous
and
should
be
strictly
avoided
in
place
of
all
these
unwise
practices
a
short
time
should
be
set
aside
each
night
and
also
morning
if
possible
for
getting
into
touch
with
reality
you
should
then
endeavour
to
realize
that
the
body
mind
and
soul
are
but
vehicles
of
expression
mere
servants
of
the
true
self
or
ego
this
will
bring
about
in
time
a
consciousness
of
identity
with
the
one
eternal
spirit
what
jesus
called
our
father
in
heaven
one
might
proceed
after
this
fashion
my
body
is
not
myself
but
is
merely
something
that
enables
me
to
live
this
material
life
and
gain
experience
my
mind
is
not
myself
but
merely
an
instrument
which
i
use
and
which
obeys
my
will
my
soul
is
not
myself
but
merely
a
garment
of
my
spirit
my
will
is
not
myself
but
is
something
of
which
i
the
true
self
make
use
and
so
on
by
this
means
you
gradually
approach
the
great
truth
which
can
not
be
put
into
words
and
which
can
only
become
yours
through
realization
or
inward
spiritual
understanding
in
addition
one
can
use
a
positive
statement
of
truth
reverently
but
with
full
confidence
such
as
i
am
a
branch
in
the
true
vine
in
course
of
time
you
will
become
possessed
of
a
feeling
of
tremendous
and
unlimited
power
and
security
this
is
a
great
responsibility
for
this
power
must
be
used
only
in
service
and
not
for
selfish
purposes
if
it
is
used
for
the
acquisition
of
wealth
and
the
gaining
of
temporal
power
great
disaster
will
be
the
inevitable
result
yet
if
used
aright
it
is
bound
to
have
a
great
though
unconscious
influence
for
good
on
the
life
and
for
this
you
are
not
responsible
constantly
endeavour
to
serve
and
bless
others
then
because
you
do
not
seek
them
crowds
of
blessings
will
come
into
your
life
unbidden
great
happiness
being
one
of
the
chief
having
found
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
will
be
your
experience
that
all
needed
good
will
be
added
unto
you
this
power
may
also
be
used
to
strengthen
character
to
overcome
in
the
conflicts
of
the
soul
and
to
build
up
the
spiritual
body
which
will
be
our
vehicle
of
expression
in
higher
realms
the
end
