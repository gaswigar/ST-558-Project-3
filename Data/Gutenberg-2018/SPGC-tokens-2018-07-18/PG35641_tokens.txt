the
shadow
in
the
moonlight
the
man
with
the
cough
between
the
stiles
at
the
dip
of
the
road
will
not
take
place
the
clock
that
struck
thirteen
uncanny
tales
the
shadow
in
the
moonlight
part
i
we
never
thought
of
finster
mabyn
being
haunted
we
really
never
did
this
may
seem
strange
but
it
is
absolutely
true
it
was
such
an
extremely
interesting
and
curious
place
in
many
ways
that
it
required
nothing
extraneous
to
add
to
its
attractions
perhaps
this
was
the
reason
immediately
that
you
hear
of
a
house
being
very
old
the
next
remark
is
sure
to
be
i
hope
it
is
or
is
not
that
depends
on
the
taste
of
the
speaker
haunted
but
finster
was
more
than
very
old
it
was
and
in
a
modest
way
historical
i
will
not
take
up
time
by
relating
its
history
however
or
by
referring
my
readers
to
the
chronicles
in
which
mention
of
it
may
be
found
nor
shall
i
yield
to
the
temptation
of
describing
the
room
in
which
a
certain
royalty
spent
one
night
if
not
two
or
three
nights
four
centuries
ago
or
the
tower
now
in
ruins
where
an
even
more
renowned
personage
was
imprisoned
for
several
months
all
these
facts
or
legends
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
i
have
to
tell
nor
strictly
speaking
has
finster
itself
except
as
a
sort
of
prologue
to
my
narrative
we
heard
of
the
house
through
friends
living
in
the
same
county
though
some
distance
farther
inland
they
and
miss
miles
it
is
convenient
to
give
their
name
at
once
knew
that
we
had
been
ordered
to
leave
our
own
home
for
some
months
to
get
over
the
effects
of
a
very
trying
visitation
of
influenza
and
that
was
specially
desirable
we
grumbled
at
this
seaside
places
are
often
so
dull
and
commonplace
but
when
we
heard
of
finster
we
grumbled
no
longer
dull
in
a
sense
it
might
be
but
assuredly
not
commonplace
janet
miles
description
of
it
though
she
was
not
particularly
clever
at
description
read
like
a
fairy
tale
or
one
of
longfellow
poems
a
castle
by
the
sea
how
perfect
we
all
exclaimed
do
oh
do
fix
for
it
mother
the
objections
were
quickly
it
was
rather
isolated
said
miss
miles
standing
as
was
not
difficult
to
trace
in
its
name
on
a
point
of
land
a
corner
rather
with
sea
on
two
sides
it
had
not
been
lived
in
save
spasmodically
for
some
years
for
the
late
owner
was
one
of
those
happy
or
unhappy
people
who
have
more
houses
than
they
can
use
and
the
present
one
was
a
minor
eventually
it
was
to
be
overhauled
and
some
additions
and
alterations
made
but
the
trustees
would
be
glad
to
let
it
at
a
moderate
rent
for
some
months
and
had
intended
putting
it
into
some
agents
hands
when
mr
miles
happened
to
meet
one
of
them
who
mentioned
it
to
him
there
was
nothing
against
it
it
was
absolutely
healthy
but
the
furniture
was
old
and
shabby
and
there
was
none
too
much
of
it
if
we
wanted
to
have
visitors
we
should
certainly
require
to
add
to
it
this
however
could
easily
be
done
our
informant
went
on
to
say
there
was
a
very
good
upholsterer
and
furniture
dealer
at
raxtrew
the
nearest
town
who
was
in
the
habit
of
hiring
out
things
to
the
officers
at
the
fort
indeed
she
added
we
often
pick
up
charming
old
pieces
of
furniture
from
him
for
next
to
nothing
so
you
could
both
hire
and
buy
of
course
we
should
have
visitors
and
our
own
house
would
not
be
the
worse
for
some
additional
chairs
and
tables
here
and
there
in
place
of
some
excellent
monstrosities
phil
and
nugent
and
i
had
persuaded
mother
to
get
rid
of
if
i
go
down
to
spy
the
land
with
father
i
said
i
shall
certainly
go
to
the
furniture
dealer
and
have
a
good
look
about
me
i
did
go
with
father
i
was
nineteen
it
is
four
years
ago
and
a
capable
sort
of
girl
then
i
was
the
only
one
who
had
not
been
ill
and
mother
had
been
the
worst
of
all
mother
and
dormy
poor
little
chap
for
nearly
died
he
is
the
youngest
of
us
we
are
four
boys
and
two
girls
sophy
was
then
fifteen
my
own
name
is
leila
if
i
attempted
to
give
any
idea
of
the
impression
finster
made
upon
us
i
should
go
on
for
hours
it
simply
took
our
breath
away
it
really
felt
like
going
back
a
few
centuries
merely
to
enter
within
the
walls
and
gaze
round
you
and
yet
we
did
not
see
it
to
any
advantage
so
at
least
said
the
two
miles
who
were
our
guides
it
was
a
gloomy
day
with
the
feeling
of
rain
not
far
off
early
in
april
it
might
have
been
november
though
it
was
not
cold
you
can
scarcely
imagine
what
it
is
on
a
bright
day
said
janet
eager
as
people
always
are
in
such
circumstances
to
show
off
her
the
lights
and
shadows
are
so
exquisite
i
love
it
as
it
is
i
said
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
regret
having
seen
it
first
on
a
grey
day
it
is
just
perfect
she
was
pleased
at
my
admiration
and
did
her
utmost
to
facilitate
matters
father
was
taken
with
the
place
too
i
could
see
but
he
hummed
and
hawed
a
good
deal
about
the
bareness
of
the
rooms
the
bedrooms
especially
so
janet
and
i
went
into
it
at
once
in
a
way
making
lists
of
the
actually
necessary
additions
which
did
not
prove
very
formidable
after
all
hunter
will
manage
all
that
said
miss
miles
upon
which
father
gave
in
i
believe
he
had
meant
to
do
so
all
the
time
the
rent
was
really
so
low
that
a
little
could
be
afforded
i
suggested
and
father
agreed
it
is
extremely
low
he
said
for
a
place
possessing
so
many
advantages
but
even
then
it
did
not
occur
to
any
of
us
to
suggest
suspiciously
low
we
had
the
miles
guarantee
for
it
all
to
begin
with
had
there
been
any
objection
they
must
have
known
it
we
spent
the
night
with
them
and
the
next
morning
at
the
furniture
dealer
he
was
a
quick
obliging
little
man
and
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
terms
were
so
moderate
that
father
said
to
me
amiably
there
are
some
quaint
odds
and
ends
here
leila
you
might
choose
a
few
things
to
use
at
finster
in
the
first
place
and
then
to
take
home
with
us
i
was
only
too
ready
to
profit
by
the
permission
and
with
help
a
few
charmingly
quaint
chairs
and
tables
a
wall
cabinet
and
some
other
trifles
were
soon
put
aside
for
us
we
were
just
leaving
when
at
one
end
of
the
shop
some
draperies
caught
my
eye
what
are
these
i
asked
the
upholsterer
curtains
why
this
is
real
old
tapestry
the
obliging
hunter
drew
out
the
material
in
question
they
are
not
exactly
curtains
miss
he
said
i
thought
they
would
make
nice
you
see
the
tapestry
is
set
into
cloth
it
was
so
frail
when
i
got
it
that
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
with
it
he
had
managed
it
very
ingeniously
two
panels
so
to
say
of
old
tapestry
very
charming
in
tone
had
been
lined
and
framed
with
dull
green
cloth
making
a
very
good
pair
of
indeed
oh
papa
i
cried
do
let
us
have
these
there
are
sure
to
be
draughty
doors
at
finster
and
afterwards
they
would
make
for
the
two
side
doors
in
the
hall
at
home
father
eyed
the
tapestry
appreciatively
but
first
prudently
inquired
the
price
it
seemed
higher
in
proportion
than
hunter
other
charges
you
see
sir
he
said
half
apologetically
the
panels
are
real
antique
work
though
so
much
the
worse
for
wear
where
did
they
come
from
asked
father
hunter
hesitated
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
he
replied
i
was
asked
not
to
name
the
party
that
i
bought
it
from
it
seems
a
pity
to
part
with
but
it
happens
sometimes
i
bought
several
things
together
of
a
family
quite
lately
the
have
only
come
out
of
the
workroom
this
morning
we
hurried
on
with
them
to
stop
them
fraying
more
you
see
where
they
were
before
they
must
have
been
nailed
to
the
wall
janet
miles
who
was
something
of
a
connoisseur
had
been
examining
the
tapestry
it
is
well
worth
what
he
asks
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
often
come
across
such
tapestry
in
england
so
the
bargain
was
struck
and
hunter
promised
to
see
all
that
we
had
chosen
both
purchased
and
hired
delivered
at
finster
the
week
before
we
proposed
to
come
nothing
interfered
with
our
plans
by
the
end
of
the
month
we
found
ourselves
at
our
temporary
home
all
of
us
except
nat
our
third
brother
who
was
at
school
dormer
the
small
boy
still
did
lessons
with
sophy
governess
the
two
older
boys
as
we
called
them
happened
to
be
at
home
from
different
reasons
one
nugent
on
leave
from
india
phil
forced
to
miss
a
term
at
college
through
an
attack
of
the
same
illness
which
had
treated
mother
and
dormy
so
badly
but
now
that
everybody
was
well
again
and
going
to
be
very
much
better
thanks
to
finster
air
we
thought
the
ill
wind
had
brought
us
some
very
distinct
good
it
would
not
have
been
half
such
fun
had
we
not
been
a
large
family
party
to
start
with
and
before
we
had
been
a
week
at
the
place
we
had
added
to
our
numbers
by
the
first
detachment
of
the
guests
we
had
invited
it
was
not
a
very
large
house
besides
ourselves
we
had
not
room
for
more
than
three
or
four
others
for
some
of
the
rooms
those
on
the
top
story
were
really
too
dilapidated
to
suit
any
one
but
rats
rats
or
ghosts
said
some
one
laughingly
one
day
when
we
had
been
exploring
them
afterwards
the
words
returned
to
my
memory
we
had
made
ourselves
very
comfortable
thanks
to
the
invaluable
hunter
and
every
day
the
weather
grew
milder
and
more
the
woods
on
the
inland
side
were
full
of
primroses
it
promised
to
be
a
lovely
season
there
was
a
gallery
along
one
side
of
the
house
which
soon
became
a
favourite
resort
it
made
a
pleasant
in
the
especially
though
less
so
in
the
evening
as
the
fireplace
at
one
end
warmed
it
but
imperfectly
and
besides
this
it
was
difficult
to
light
up
it
was
draughty
too
as
there
was
a
superfluity
of
doors
two
of
which
one
at
each
end
we
at
once
condemned
they
were
not
needed
as
the
one
led
by
a
very
long
spiral
staircase
to
the
unused
attic
rooms
the
other
to
the
kitchen
and
offices
and
when
we
did
have
afternoon
tea
in
the
gallery
it
was
easy
to
bring
it
through
the
dining
or
long
rooms
lighted
at
their
extreme
ends
which
ran
parallel
to
the
gallery
lengthways
both
of
which
had
a
door
opening
on
to
it
as
well
as
from
the
hall
on
the
other
side
for
all
the
principal
rooms
at
finster
were
on
the
not
on
the
the
closing
of
these
doors
got
rid
of
a
great
deal
of
draught
and
as
i
have
said
the
weather
was
really
mild
and
calm
one
afternoon
i
am
trying
to
begin
at
the
beginning
of
our
strange
experiences
even
at
the
risk
of
it
seems
better
to
do
so
we
were
all
assembled
in
the
gallery
at
the
children
as
we
called
sophy
and
dormer
much
to
sophy
disgust
and
their
governess
were
with
us
for
rules
were
relaxed
at
finster
and
miss
larpent
was
a
great
favourite
with
us
all
suddenly
sophy
gave
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
mamma
she
said
i
wish
you
would
speak
to
dormer
he
has
thrown
over
my
only
look
at
my
frock
if
you
can
not
sit
still
she
added
turning
herself
to
the
boy
i
do
think
you
should
be
allowed
to
come
to
tea
here
what
is
the
matter
dormy
said
mother
dormer
was
standing
beside
sophy
looking
very
guilty
and
rather
white
mamma
he
said
i
was
only
drawing
a
chair
out
it
got
so
dreadfully
cold
where
i
was
sitting
i
really
could
not
stay
there
and
he
shivered
slightly
he
had
been
sitting
with
his
back
to
one
of
the
doors
phil
who
was
nearest
moved
his
hand
slowly
across
the
spot
you
are
fanciful
dormy
he
said
there
is
really
no
draught
whatever
this
did
not
satisfy
mother
he
must
have
got
a
chill
then
she
said
and
she
went
on
to
question
the
child
as
to
what
he
had
been
doing
all
day
for
as
i
have
said
he
was
still
delicate
but
he
persisted
that
he
was
quite
well
and
no
longer
cold
it
was
exactly
a
draught
he
said
it
was
oh
just
icy
all
of
a
sudden
i
felt
it
before
sitting
in
that
chair
mother
said
no
more
and
dormer
went
on
with
his
tea
and
when
came
he
seemed
just
as
usual
so
that
her
anxiety
faded
but
she
made
thorough
investigation
as
to
the
possibility
of
any
draught
coming
up
from
the
back
stairs
with
which
this
door
communicated
none
was
to
be
discovered
the
door
fitted
fairly
well
and
beside
this
hunter
had
tacked
felt
round
the
edges
furthermore
one
of
the
thick
heavy
had
been
hung
in
front
an
evening
or
two
later
we
were
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
after
dinner
when
a
cousin
who
was
staying
with
us
suddenly
missed
her
fan
run
and
fetch
muriel
fan
dormy
i
said
for
muriel
felt
sure
it
had
slipped
under
the
dinner
table
none
of
the
men
had
as
yet
joined
us
why
where
are
you
going
child
as
he
turned
towards
the
farther
door
it
is
much
quicker
by
the
gallery
he
said
nothing
but
went
out
walking
rather
slowly
by
the
gallery
door
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
fan
in
hand
but
by
the
door
he
was
a
sensitive
child
and
though
i
wondered
what
he
had
got
into
his
head
against
the
gallery
i
did
not
say
anything
before
the
others
but
when
soon
after
dormy
said
good
night
and
went
off
to
bed
i
followed
him
what
do
you
want
leila
he
said
rather
crossly
do
be
vexed
child
i
said
i
can
see
there
is
something
the
matter
why
do
you
not
like
the
gallery
he
hesitated
but
i
had
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
he
knew
i
meant
to
be
kind
leila
he
said
with
a
glance
round
to
be
sure
that
no
one
was
within
hearing
we
were
standing
he
and
i
near
the
inner
door
which
was
open
you
laugh
at
me
but
there
something
queer
there
sometimes
what
and
how
do
you
mean
i
asked
with
a
slight
thrill
at
his
tone
i
mean
not
always
i
felt
it
several
times
there
was
the
cold
the
day
before
yesterday
and
besides
that
i
felt
a
a
sort
of
dormy
was
not
perfect
in
his
th
like
somebody
very
unhappy
sighing
i
suggested
like
sighing
in
a
whisper
he
replied
and
that
always
near
the
door
but
last
week
no
not
so
long
ago
it
was
on
monday
i
went
round
that
way
when
i
was
going
to
bed
i
did
want
to
be
silly
but
it
was
moonlight
and
leila
a
shadow
went
all
along
the
wall
on
that
side
and
stopped
at
the
door
i
saw
it
waggling
about
its
and
here
he
shivered
on
that
funny
curtain
that
hangs
up
as
if
it
were
feeling
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
well
what
then
it
just
went
out
he
said
simply
but
it
moonlight
again
sister
and
i
dare
see
it
again
i
just
but
you
did
go
to
the
that
way
i
reminded
him
yes
but
i
shut
my
eyes
and
ran
and
even
then
i
felt
as
if
something
cold
was
behind
me
dormy
dear
i
said
a
good
deal
concerned
i
do
think
it
your
fancy
you
are
not
well
yet
you
know
yes
i
am
he
replied
sturdily
i
not
a
bit
frightened
anywhere
else
i
sleep
in
a
room
alone
you
know
it
not
sister
its
somefing
in
the
gallery
would
you
be
frightened
to
go
there
with
me
now
we
can
run
through
the
there
no
one
to
see
us
and
i
turned
in
that
direction
as
i
spoke
again
my
little
brother
hesitated
i
go
with
you
if
you
hold
hands
he
said
but
i
shut
my
eyes
and
i
wo
open
them
till
you
tell
me
there
no
shadow
on
the
wall
you
must
tell
me
truly
but
there
must
be
some
shadows
i
said
in
this
bright
moonlight
trees
and
branches
or
even
clouds
scudding
across
something
of
that
kind
is
what
you
must
have
seen
dear
he
shook
his
head
no
no
of
course
i
would
mind
that
i
know
the
difference
no
you
could
mistake
it
goes
along
right
along
in
a
creeping
way
and
then
at
the
door
its
hands
come
farther
out
and
it
is
it
like
a
man
or
a
woman
i
said
beginning
to
feel
rather
creepy
myself
i
think
it
most
like
a
rather
little
man
he
replied
but
i
not
sure
its
head
has
got
something
fuzzy
about
it
oh
i
know
like
a
sticking
out
wig
but
lower
down
it
seems
wrapped
up
like
in
a
cloak
oh
it
and
again
he
shivered
it
was
quite
time
all
this
nightmare
nonsense
was
put
out
of
his
poor
little
head
i
took
his
hand
and
held
it
firmly
we
went
through
the
nothing
could
have
looked
more
comfortable
and
less
ghostly
for
the
lights
were
still
burning
on
the
table
and
the
flowers
in
their
silver
bowls
some
wine
gleaming
in
the
glasses
the
fruit
and
pretty
dishes
made
a
pleasant
glow
of
colour
it
certainly
seemed
a
curiously
sudden
contrast
when
we
found
ourselves
in
the
gallery
beyond
cold
and
unillumined
save
by
the
pale
moonlight
streaming
through
the
unshuttered
windows
for
the
door
closed
with
a
bang
as
we
passed
through
the
gallery
a
draughty
place
dormy
hold
tightened
sister
he
whispered
i
shut
my
eyes
now
you
must
stand
with
your
back
to
the
windows
between
them
or
else
you
think
it
our
own
shadows
and
watch
i
did
as
he
said
and
i
had
not
long
to
wait
it
came
from
the
farther
end
the
second
condemned
door
whence
the
winding
stair
mounted
to
the
attics
it
seemed
to
begin
or
at
least
take
form
there
creeping
along
just
as
dormy
said
stealthily
but
steadily
right
down
to
the
other
extremity
of
the
long
room
and
then
it
grew
blacker
more
concentrated
and
out
from
the
vague
outline
came
two
bony
hands
and
as
the
child
had
said
too
you
could
see
that
they
were
all
over
the
upper
part
of
the
door
i
stood
and
watched
i
wondered
afterwards
at
my
own
courage
if
courage
it
was
it
was
the
shadow
of
a
small
man
i
felt
sure
the
head
seemed
large
in
proportion
and
yes
it
the
original
of
the
shadow
was
evidently
covered
by
an
antique
wig
half
mechanically
i
glanced
round
as
if
in
search
of
the
material
body
that
be
there
but
no
there
was
nothing
literally
that
could
throw
this
extraordinary
shadow
of
this
i
was
instantly
convinced
and
here
i
may
as
well
say
once
for
all
that
never
was
it
maintained
by
any
one
however
previously
sceptical
who
had
fully
witnessed
the
whole
that
it
could
be
accounted
for
by
ordinary
or
as
people
say
natural
causes
there
was
this
peculiarity
at
least
about
our
ghost
though
i
had
fast
hold
of
his
hand
i
had
almost
forgotten
dormy
i
seemed
in
a
trance
suddenly
he
spoke
though
in
a
whisper
you
see
it
sister
i
know
you
do
he
said
wait
wait
a
minute
dear
i
managed
to
reply
in
the
same
tone
though
i
could
not
have
explained
why
i
waited
dormer
had
said
that
after
a
time
after
the
ghastly
and
apparently
fruitless
all
over
the
door
it
went
out
i
think
it
was
this
that
i
was
waiting
for
it
was
not
quite
as
he
had
said
the
door
was
in
the
extreme
corner
of
the
wall
the
hinges
almost
in
the
angle
and
as
the
shadow
began
to
move
on
again
it
as
if
it
disappeared
but
no
it
was
only
fainter
my
eyes
preternaturally
sharpened
by
my
intense
gaze
still
saw
it
working
its
way
round
the
corner
as
assuredly
no
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
ever
did
nor
could
do
i
realised
this
and
the
sense
of
horror
grew
all
but
intolerable
yet
i
stood
still
clasping
the
cold
little
hand
in
mine
tighter
and
tighter
and
an
instinct
of
protection
of
the
child
gave
me
strength
besides
it
was
coming
on
so
quickly
we
could
not
have
escaped
it
was
coming
nay
it
us
leila
gasped
dormy
the
cold
you
feel
it
now
yes
truly
like
no
icy
breath
that
i
had
ever
felt
before
was
that
momentary
but
horrible
thrill
of
utter
cold
if
it
had
lasted
another
second
i
think
it
would
have
killed
us
both
but
mercifully
it
passed
in
far
less
time
than
it
has
taken
me
to
tell
it
and
then
we
seemed
in
some
strange
way
to
be
released
open
your
eyes
dormy
i
said
you
wo
see
anything
i
promise
you
i
want
to
rush
across
to
the
he
obeyed
me
i
felt
there
was
time
to
escape
before
that
awful
presence
would
again
have
arrived
at
the
door
though
it
was
ah
yes
it
was
coming
steadily
pursuing
its
ghastly
round
and
alas
the
door
was
closed
but
i
kept
my
nerve
to
some
extent
i
turned
the
handle
without
over
much
trembling
and
in
another
moment
the
door
shut
and
locked
behind
us
we
stood
in
safety
looking
at
each
other
in
the
bright
cheerful
room
we
had
left
so
short
a
time
ago
it
so
short
a
time
i
said
to
myself
it
seemed
hours
and
through
the
door
open
to
the
hall
came
at
that
moment
the
sound
of
cheerful
laughing
voices
from
the
some
one
was
coming
out
it
seemed
impossible
incredible
that
within
a
few
feet
of
the
pleasant
material
life
this
horrible
inexplicable
drama
should
be
going
on
as
doubtless
it
still
was
of
the
two
i
was
now
more
upset
than
my
little
brother
i
was
older
and
took
in
more
he
was
in
a
sense
triumphant
at
having
proved
himself
correct
and
no
coward
and
though
he
was
still
pale
his
eyes
shone
with
excitement
and
a
queer
kind
of
satisfaction
but
before
we
had
done
more
than
look
at
each
other
a
figure
appeared
at
the
open
doorway
it
was
sophy
leila
she
said
mamma
wants
to
know
what
you
are
doing
with
dormy
he
is
to
go
to
bed
at
once
we
saw
you
go
out
of
the
room
after
him
and
then
a
door
banged
mamma
says
if
you
are
playing
with
him
it
very
bad
for
him
so
late
at
night
dormy
was
very
quick
he
was
still
holding
my
hand
and
he
pinched
it
to
stop
my
replying
rubbish
he
said
i
am
speaking
to
leila
quietly
and
she
is
coming
up
to
my
room
while
i
undress
good
night
sophy
tell
mamma
dormy
really
wants
me
i
added
and
then
sophy
departed
we
mus
tell
leila
said
the
boy
she
have
whom
shall
we
tell
i
said
for
i
was
beginning
to
feel
very
helpless
and
upset
nobody
he
replied
sensibly
you
go
in
there
and
he
shivered
a
little
as
he
moved
his
head
towards
the
gallery
you
not
fit
for
it
and
they
be
wanting
you
to
wait
till
the
morning
and
then
i
i
think
i
tell
philip
first
you
need
be
frightened
sister
it
wo
stop
you
sleeping
it
did
me
the
time
i
saw
it
before
he
was
right
i
slept
dreamlessly
it
was
as
if
the
intense
nervous
strain
of
those
few
minutes
had
utterly
exhausted
me
part
ii
phil
is
our
soldier
brother
and
there
is
nothing
fanciful
about
he
is
a
rock
of
sturdy
and
unfailing
good
nature
he
was
the
very
best
person
to
confide
our
strange
secret
to
and
my
respect
for
dormy
increased
we
did
tell
him
the
very
next
morning
he
listened
very
attentively
only
putting
in
a
question
here
and
there
and
though
of
course
he
was
incredulous
had
i
not
been
so
myself
he
was
not
mocking
i
am
glad
you
have
told
no
one
else
he
said
when
we
had
related
the
whole
as
circumstantially
as
possible
you
see
mother
is
not
very
strong
yet
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
bother
father
just
when
taken
this
place
and
settled
it
all
and
for
goodness
sake
do
let
a
breath
of
it
get
about
among
the
servants
there
be
the
something
to
pay
if
you
did
i
wo
tell
anybody
said
dormy
nor
shall
i
i
added
sophy
is
far
too
excitable
and
if
she
knew
she
would
certainly
tell
nannie
nannie
is
our
old
nurse
if
we
tell
any
one
philip
went
on
that
means
with
a
rather
irritating
smile
of
if
by
any
possibility
i
do
not
succeed
in
making
an
end
of
your
ghost
and
we
want
another
opinion
about
it
the
person
to
tell
would
be
miss
larpent
yes
i
said
i
think
so
too
i
would
not
risk
irritating
him
by
saying
how
convinced
i
was
that
conviction
awaited
as
surely
it
had
come
to
myself
and
i
knew
that
miss
larpent
though
far
from
credulous
was
equally
far
from
stupid
scepticism
concerning
the
mysteries
not
dreamt
of
in
ordinary
philosophy
what
do
you
mean
to
do
i
went
on
you
have
a
theory
i
see
you
tell
me
what
it
is
i
have
two
said
phil
rolling
up
a
cigarette
as
he
spoke
it
is
either
some
queer
optical
illusion
partly
the
effect
of
some
odd
reflection
outside
or
it
is
a
clever
trick
a
trick
i
exclaimed
what
motive
could
there
be
for
a
trick
phil
shook
his
head
ah
he
said
that
i
can
not
at
present
say
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
shall
sit
up
in
the
gallery
and
see
for
myself
alone
i
exclaimed
with
some
misgiving
for
big
sturdy
fellow
as
he
was
i
scarcely
liked
to
think
of
him
of
alone
with
that
awful
thing
i
do
suppose
you
or
dormy
would
care
to
keep
me
company
he
replied
and
on
the
whole
i
would
rather
not
have
you
i
would
do
it
said
the
child
honestly
not
for
for
nothing
i
shall
keep
tim
with
me
said
philip
i
would
rather
have
him
than
any
one
tim
is
phil
and
certainly
i
agreed
much
better
than
nobody
so
it
was
settled
dormy
and
i
went
to
bed
unusually
early
that
night
for
as
the
day
wore
on
we
both
felt
exceedingly
tired
i
pleaded
a
headache
which
was
not
altogether
a
fiction
though
i
repented
having
complained
at
all
when
i
found
that
poor
mamma
immediately
began
worrying
herself
with
fears
that
after
all
i
too
was
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
influenza
i
shall
be
all
right
in
the
morning
i
assured
her
i
knew
no
further
details
of
phil
arrangements
i
fell
asleep
almost
at
once
i
usually
do
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
slept
a
whole
night
when
i
was
awakened
by
a
glimmering
light
at
my
door
and
heard
philip
voice
speaking
softly
are
you
awake
lel
he
said
as
people
always
say
when
they
awake
you
in
any
untimely
way
of
course
i
was
awake
very
much
awake
indeed
what
is
it
i
exclaimed
eagerly
my
heart
beginning
to
beat
very
fast
oh
nothing
nothing
at
all
said
my
brother
advancing
a
little
into
the
room
i
just
thought
i
look
in
on
my
way
to
bed
to
reassure
you
i
have
seen
absolutely
nothing
i
do
not
know
if
i
was
relieved
or
disappointed
was
it
moonlight
i
asked
abruptly
no
he
replied
unluckily
the
moon
did
not
come
out
at
all
though
it
is
nearly
at
the
full
i
carried
in
a
small
lamp
which
made
things
less
eerie
but
i
should
have
preferred
the
moon
i
glanced
up
at
him
was
it
the
reflection
of
the
candle
he
held
or
did
he
look
paler
than
usual
and
i
added
suddenly
did
you
nothing
he
hesitated
it
it
was
chilly
certainly
he
said
i
fancy
i
must
have
dosed
a
little
for
i
did
feel
pretty
cold
once
or
twice
ah
indeed
thought
i
to
myself
and
how
about
tim
phil
smiled
but
not
very
successfully
well
he
said
i
must
confess
tim
did
not
altogether
like
it
he
started
snarling
then
he
growled
and
finished
up
with
whining
in
a
decidedly
unhappy
way
he
rather
upset
poor
old
chap
and
then
i
saw
that
the
dog
was
beside
him
rubbing
up
close
to
legs
a
very
dejected
reproachful
tim
all
the
starch
taken
out
of
him
phil
i
said
turning
round
on
my
pillow
i
glad
you
are
satisfied
morning
you
must
tell
me
which
of
your
theories
holds
most
water
and
many
thanks
he
was
going
to
say
more
but
my
manner
for
the
moment
stopped
him
and
he
went
off
poor
old
phil
we
had
it
out
the
next
morning
he
and
i
alone
he
was
satisfied
far
from
it
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
i
believe
it
was
a
strange
yearning
for
a
breath
of
human
companionship
for
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
that
had
made
him
look
in
on
me
the
night
before
he
had
felt
the
cold
passing
but
he
was
very
plucky
i
sit
up
again
leila
he
said
not
i
objected
this
sort
of
adventure
requires
one
to
be
at
one
best
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
go
to
bed
early
and
have
a
good
stretch
of
sleep
so
that
you
will
be
quite
fresh
by
there
will
be
a
moon
for
some
nights
still
why
do
you
keep
harping
on
the
moon
said
phil
rather
crossly
for
him
because
i
have
some
idea
that
it
is
only
in
the
moonlight
that
that
anything
is
to
be
bosh
said
my
brother
politely
he
was
certainly
rather
discomposed
we
are
talking
at
you
are
satisfied
far
from
satisfied
i
interpolated
well
convinced
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
that
the
whole
thing
is
supernatural
whereas
i
am
equally
sure
it
is
a
trick
a
clever
trick
i
allow
though
i
have
yet
got
at
the
motive
of
it
you
need
your
nerves
to
be
at
their
best
to
discover
a
trick
of
this
kind
if
a
trick
it
be
i
said
quietly
philip
had
left
his
seat
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
his
way
of
doing
so
gave
me
a
feeling
that
he
wanted
to
walk
off
some
unusual
consciousness
of
irritability
i
felt
half
provoked
and
half
sorry
for
him
at
that
moment
we
were
alone
in
the
the
door
opened
and
miss
larpent
came
in
i
can
not
find
sophy
she
said
peering
about
through
her
rather
eyes
which
nevertheless
see
a
great
deal
sometimes
do
you
know
where
she
is
i
saw
her
setting
off
somewhere
with
nugent
said
philip
stopping
his
exercise
for
a
moment
ah
then
it
is
hopeless
i
suppose
i
must
resign
myself
to
very
irregular
ways
for
a
little
longer
miss
larpent
replied
with
a
smile
she
is
not
young
and
not
good
looking
but
she
is
gifted
with
a
delightful
way
of
smiling
and
she
is
well
the
dearest
and
almost
the
wisest
of
women
she
looked
at
philip
as
he
spoke
she
had
known
us
nearly
since
our
babyhood
is
there
anything
the
matter
she
said
suddenly
you
look
fagged
leila
and
philip
seems
worried
i
glanced
at
philip
he
understood
me
yes
he
replied
i
am
irritated
and
leila
is
he
hesitated
what
asked
miss
larpent
oh
i
do
know
obstinate
i
suppose
sit
down
miss
larpent
and
hear
our
story
leila
you
can
tell
it
i
did
so
first
obtaining
a
promise
of
secrecy
and
making
phil
relate
his
own
experience
our
new
listened
attentively
her
face
very
grave
when
she
had
heard
all
she
said
quietly
after
a
moment
silence
it
very
strange
very
philip
if
you
will
wait
till
night
and
i
quite
agree
with
leila
that
you
had
better
do
so
i
will
sit
up
with
you
i
have
pretty
good
nerves
and
i
have
always
wanted
an
experience
of
that
kind
then
you
do
think
it
is
a
trick
i
said
eagerly
i
was
like
dormer
divided
between
my
real
underlying
longing
to
explain
the
thing
and
get
rid
of
the
horror
of
it
and
a
half
childish
wish
to
prove
that
i
had
not
exaggerated
its
ghastliness
i
will
tell
you
that
the
day
after
she
said
i
could
not
repress
a
little
shiver
as
she
spoke
she
good
nerves
and
she
was
extremely
sensible
but
i
almost
blamed
myself
afterwards
for
having
acquiesced
in
the
plan
for
the
effect
on
her
was
very
great
they
never
told
me
exactly
what
happened
you
said
miss
larpent
i
imagine
their
experience
was
almost
precisely
similar
to
dormy
and
mine
intensified
perhaps
by
the
feeling
of
loneliness
for
it
was
not
till
all
the
rest
of
the
family
was
in
bed
that
this
second
vigil
began
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
they
had
the
whole
thing
complete
it
was
impossible
to
throw
off
the
effect
even
in
the
daytime
the
four
of
us
who
had
seen
and
heard
shrank
from
the
gallery
and
made
any
conceivable
excuse
for
avoiding
it
but
phil
however
convinced
behaved
consistently
he
examined
the
closed
door
thoroughly
to
detect
any
possible
trickery
he
explored
the
attics
he
went
up
and
down
the
staircase
leading
to
the
offices
till
the
servants
must
have
thought
he
was
going
crazy
he
found
no
vaguest
hint
even
as
to
why
the
gallery
was
chosen
by
the
ghostly
shadow
for
its
nightly
round
strange
to
say
however
as
the
moon
waned
our
horror
faded
so
that
we
almost
began
to
hope
the
thing
was
at
an
end
and
to
trust
that
in
time
we
should
forget
about
it
and
we
congratulated
ourselves
that
we
had
kept
our
own
counsel
and
not
disturbed
any
of
the
others
even
father
who
would
no
doubt
have
hooted
at
the
idea
by
the
baleful
whisper
that
our
charming
castle
by
the
sea
was
haunted
and
the
days
passed
by
growing
into
weeks
the
second
detachment
of
our
guests
had
left
and
a
third
had
just
arrived
when
one
morning
as
i
was
waiting
at
what
we
called
the
for
some
of
the
others
to
join
me
in
a
walk
along
the
sands
some
one
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
it
was
philip
leila
he
said
i
am
not
happy
about
dormer
he
is
looking
ill
again
and
i
thought
he
seemed
so
much
stronger
i
said
surprised
and
distressed
quite
rosy
and
so
much
merrier
so
he
was
till
a
few
days
ago
said
philip
but
if
you
notice
him
well
you
see
that
he
getting
that
white
look
again
and
i
got
it
into
my
head
he
is
an
extraordinarily
sensitive
child
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
moon
it
getting
on
to
the
full
for
the
moment
i
stupidly
forgot
the
association
really
phil
i
said
you
are
too
absurd
do
you
actually
oh
as
he
was
beginning
to
interrupt
me
and
my
face
fell
i
feel
sure
you
mean
about
the
gallery
yes
i
do
he
said
how
has
dormy
told
you
anything
and
a
sort
of
sick
feeling
came
over
me
i
had
begun
to
hope
i
went
on
that
somehow
it
had
gone
that
perhaps
it
only
comes
once
a
year
at
a
certain
season
or
possibly
that
newcomers
see
it
at
the
first
and
not
again
oh
phil
we
stay
here
however
nice
it
is
if
it
is
really
haunted
dormy
has
said
much
philip
replied
he
only
told
me
he
had
the
once
or
twice
the
moon
came
again
he
said
but
i
can
see
the
fear
of
more
is
upon
him
and
this
determined
me
to
speak
to
you
i
have
to
go
to
london
for
ten
days
or
so
to
see
the
doctors
about
my
leave
and
a
few
other
things
i
do
like
it
for
you
and
miss
larpent
if
if
this
thing
is
to
return
with
no
one
else
in
your
confidence
especially
on
dormy
account
do
you
think
we
must
tell
father
before
i
go
i
hesitated
for
many
reasons
i
was
reluctant
to
do
so
father
would
be
exaggeratedly
sceptical
at
first
and
then
if
he
were
convinced
as
i
he
would
be
he
would
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
insist
upon
leaving
finster
and
there
would
be
a
regular
upset
trying
for
mother
and
everybody
concerned
and
mother
liked
the
place
and
was
looking
so
much
better
after
all
i
said
it
has
not
hurt
any
of
us
miss
larpent
got
a
shake
so
did
i
but
it
was
as
great
a
shock
to
us
as
to
you
phil
to
have
to
believe
in
a
ghost
and
we
can
avoid
the
gallery
while
you
are
away
no
except
for
dormy
i
would
rather
keep
it
to
ourselves
after
all
we
are
not
going
to
live
here
always
yet
it
is
so
nice
it
seems
such
a
pity
it
was
such
an
exquisite
morning
the
air
faintly
breathing
of
the
sea
was
like
elixir
the
heights
and
shadows
on
the
cliffs
thrown
out
by
the
darker
woods
behind
were
indeed
as
janet
miles
had
said
wonderful
yes
phil
agreed
it
is
an
awful
nuisance
but
as
for
dormy
he
went
on
supposing
i
get
mother
to
let
me
take
him
with
me
he
be
as
jolly
as
a
in
london
and
my
old
landlady
would
look
after
him
like
anything
if
ever
i
had
to
be
out
late
and
i
let
my
doctor
see
him
quietly
you
know
he
might
give
him
a
tonic
or
something
i
heartily
approved
of
the
idea
so
did
mamma
when
phil
broached
it
she
too
had
thought
her
baby
looking
quite
pale
lately
a
london
doctor
opinion
would
be
such
a
satisfaction
so
it
was
settled
and
the
very
next
day
the
two
set
off
dormer
in
his
reticent
way
in
the
greatest
delight
though
only
by
one
remark
did
the
brave
little
fellow
hint
at
what
was
no
doubt
the
principal
cause
of
his
satisfaction
the
moon
will
be
long
past
the
full
when
we
come
back
he
said
and
after
that
there
only
be
one
other
time
before
we
go
wo
there
leila
we
only
got
this
house
for
three
months
yes
i
said
father
only
took
it
for
three
though
in
my
heart
i
knew
it
was
with
the
option
of
three
more
six
in
all
and
miss
larpent
and
i
were
left
alone
not
with
the
ghost
certainly
but
with
our
fateful
knowledge
of
its
unwelcome
proximity
we
did
not
speak
of
it
to
each
other
but
we
tacitly
avoided
the
gallery
even
as
much
as
possible
in
the
daytime
i
felt
and
so
she
has
since
confessed
did
she
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
endure
without
betraying
ourselves
and
i
began
to
breathe
more
freely
trusting
that
the
dread
of
the
shadow
possible
return
was
really
only
due
to
the
child
overwrought
nerves
till
one
morning
my
fool
paradise
was
abruptly
destroyed
father
came
in
late
to
breakfast
he
had
been
for
an
early
walk
he
said
to
get
rid
of
a
headache
but
he
did
not
look
altogether
as
if
he
had
succeeded
in
doing
so
leila
he
said
as
i
was
leaving
the
room
after
pouring
out
his
coffee
mamma
was
not
yet
allowed
to
get
up
early
leila
do
go
i
want
to
speak
to
you
i
stopped
short
and
turned
towards
the
table
there
was
something
very
odd
about
his
manner
he
is
usually
hearty
and
eager
almost
impetuous
in
his
way
of
speaking
leila
he
began
again
you
are
a
sensible
girl
and
your
nerves
are
strong
i
fancy
besides
you
have
not
been
ill
like
the
others
speak
of
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
i
nodded
in
assent
i
could
scarcely
have
spoken
my
heart
was
beginning
to
thump
father
would
not
have
commended
my
nerves
had
he
known
it
something
odd
and
inexplicable
happened
last
night
he
went
on
nugent
and
i
were
sitting
in
the
gallery
it
was
a
mild
night
and
the
moon
magnificent
we
thought
the
gallery
would
be
pleasanter
than
the
now
that
phil
and
his
pipes
are
away
well
we
were
sitting
quietly
i
had
lighted
my
on
the
little
table
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
nugent
was
half
lying
in
his
chair
doing
nothing
in
particular
except
admiring
the
night
when
all
at
once
he
started
violently
with
an
exclamation
and
jumping
up
came
towards
me
leila
his
teeth
were
chattering
and
he
was
with
cold
i
was
very
much
alarmed
you
know
how
ill
he
was
at
college
but
in
a
moment
or
two
he
recovered
on
earth
is
the
matter
i
said
to
him
he
tried
to
laugh
really
do
know
he
said
felt
as
if
i
had
had
an
electric
shock
of
but
i
all
right
again
now
i
went
into
the
and
made
him
take
a
little
brandy
and
water
and
sent
him
off
to
bed
then
i
came
back
still
feeling
rather
uneasy
about
him
and
sat
down
with
my
book
when
leila
you
will
scarcely
credit
it
i
myself
felt
the
same
shock
exactly
a
perfectly
thrill
of
cold
that
was
how
it
began
i
started
up
and
then
leila
by
degrees
in
some
instinctive
way
i
seemed
to
realise
what
had
caused
it
my
dear
child
you
will
think
i
have
gone
crazy
when
i
tell
you
that
there
was
a
shadow
a
shadow
in
the
moonlight
me
so
to
say
round
the
room
and
once
again
it
caught
me
up
and
again
came
that
appalling
sensation
i
would
not
give
in
i
dodged
it
after
that
and
set
myself
to
watch
it
and
then
i
need
not
quote
my
father
further
suffice
to
say
his
experience
matched
that
of
the
rest
of
us
entirely
no
i
think
it
surpassed
them
it
was
the
worst
of
all
poor
father
i
shuddered
for
him
i
think
a
shock
of
that
kind
is
harder
upon
a
man
than
upon
a
woman
our
sex
is
less
sceptical
less
entrenched
in
sturdy
matters
of
fact
more
imaginative
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
the
readiness
to
believe
what
we
can
not
explain
and
it
was
astounding
to
me
to
see
how
my
father
at
once
capitulated
never
even
to
a
possibility
of
trickery
astounding
yet
at
the
same
time
not
without
a
certain
satisfaction
in
it
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
find
others
in
the
same
boat
with
ourselves
i
told
him
at
once
all
had
to
tell
and
how
painfully
exercised
we
had
been
as
to
the
advisability
of
keeping
our
secret
to
ourselves
i
never
saw
father
so
impressed
he
was
awfully
kind
too
and
so
sorry
for
us
he
made
me
fetch
miss
larpent
and
we
held
a
council
of
i
do
know
what
to
call
it
not
war
assuredly
for
none
of
us
thought
of
fighting
the
ghost
how
could
one
fight
a
shadow
we
decided
to
do
nothing
beyond
endeavouring
to
keep
the
affair
from
going
further
during
the
next
few
days
father
arranged
to
have
some
work
done
in
the
gallery
which
would
prevent
our
sitting
there
without
raising
any
suspicions
on
mamma
or
sophy
part
and
then
said
father
we
must
see
possibly
this
extraordinary
influence
only
makes
itself
felt
periodically
i
am
almost
certain
it
is
so
said
miss
larpent
and
in
this
case
he
continued
we
may
manage
to
evade
it
but
i
do
not
feel
disposed
to
continue
my
tenancy
here
after
three
months
are
over
if
once
the
servants
get
hold
of
the
story
and
they
are
sure
to
do
so
sooner
or
later
it
would
be
unendurable
the
worry
and
annoyance
would
do
your
mother
far
more
harm
than
any
good
effect
the
air
and
change
have
had
upon
her
i
was
glad
to
hear
this
decision
honestly
i
did
not
feel
as
if
i
could
stand
the
strain
for
long
and
it
might
kill
poor
little
dormy
but
where
should
we
go
our
own
home
would
be
quite
uninhabitable
till
the
autumn
for
extensive
alterations
and
repairs
were
going
on
there
i
said
this
to
father
yes
he
agreed
it
is
not
convenient
and
he
hesitated
i
can
not
make
it
out
he
went
on
miles
would
have
been
to
know
if
the
house
had
a
bad
name
in
any
way
i
think
i
will
go
over
and
see
him
and
tell
him
all
about
it
at
least
i
shall
inquire
about
some
other
house
in
the
neighbourhood
and
i
will
tell
him
our
reason
for
leaving
this
he
did
so
he
went
over
to
raxtrew
that
very
afternoon
and
as
i
quite
anticipated
would
be
the
case
he
told
me
on
his
return
that
he
had
taken
both
our
friends
into
his
confidence
they
are
extremely
concerned
about
it
he
said
and
very
sympathising
though
naturally
inclined
to
think
us
a
parcel
of
very
folk
indeed
but
i
am
glad
of
one
thing
the
rectory
there
is
to
be
let
from
the
first
of
july
for
three
months
miles
took
me
to
see
it
i
think
it
will
do
very
well
it
is
quite
out
of
the
village
for
you
really
ca
call
it
a
town
and
a
nice
little
place
in
its
way
quite
modern
and
as
as
you
could
wish
bright
and
cheery
and
what
will
mamma
think
of
our
leaving
so
soon
i
asked
but
as
to
this
father
reassured
me
he
had
already
spoken
of
it
to
her
and
somehow
she
did
not
seem
disappointed
she
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
finster
did
not
suit
dormy
and
was
quite
disposed
to
think
that
three
months
of
such
strong
air
were
enough
at
a
time
then
have
you
decided
upon
raxtrew
rectory
i
asked
i
have
the
refusal
of
it
said
my
father
but
you
will
be
almost
amused
to
hear
that
miles
begged
me
not
to
fix
absolutely
for
a
few
days
he
is
coming
to
us
to
spend
the
night
you
mean
to
see
for
himself
father
nodded
poor
mr
miles
i
ejaculated
you
wo
sit
up
with
him
i
hope
father
i
offered
to
do
so
but
he
wo
hear
of
it
was
the
reply
he
is
bringing
one
of
his
keepers
with
him
a
sturdy
trustworthy
young
fellow
and
they
two
with
their
revolvers
are
going
to
nab
the
ghost
so
he
says
we
shall
see
we
must
manage
to
prevent
our
servants
suspecting
anything
this
managed
i
need
not
go
into
particulars
suffice
to
say
that
the
sturdy
keeper
reached
his
own
home
before
dawn
on
the
night
of
the
vigil
no
endeavours
of
his
master
having
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
stay
another
moment
at
finster
and
that
mr
miles
himself
looked
so
ill
the
next
morning
when
he
joined
us
at
the
that
we
the
initiated
could
scarcely
repress
our
exclamations
when
sophy
with
the
curious
instinct
of
touching
a
sore
place
which
some
people
have
told
him
that
he
looked
exactly
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
his
experience
had
been
precisely
similar
to
ours
after
that
we
heard
no
more
from
him
about
the
pity
it
was
to
leave
a
place
that
suited
us
so
well
etc
on
the
contrary
before
he
left
he
told
my
father
and
myself
that
he
thought
us
uncommonly
plucky
for
staying
out
the
three
months
though
at
the
same
time
he
confessed
to
feeling
completely
nonplussed
i
have
lived
near
finster
mabyn
all
my
life
he
said
and
my
people
before
me
and
do
i
honestly
assure
you
have
i
heard
one
breath
of
the
old
place
being
haunted
and
in
a
neighbourhood
like
this
such
a
thing
would
have
leaked
out
we
shook
our
heads
but
what
could
we
say
part
iii
we
left
finster
mabyn
towards
the
middle
of
july
nothing
worth
recording
happened
during
the
last
few
weeks
if
the
ghostly
drama
were
still
night
after
night
or
only
during
some
portion
of
each
month
we
took
care
not
to
assist
at
the
performance
i
believe
phil
and
nugent
planned
another
vigil
but
gave
it
up
by
my
father
expressed
wish
and
on
one
pretext
or
another
he
managed
to
keep
the
gallery
locked
off
without
arousing
any
suspicion
in
my
mother
or
sophy
or
any
of
our
visitors
it
was
a
cold
summer
those
early
months
of
it
at
least
and
that
made
it
easier
to
avoid
the
room
somehow
none
of
us
were
sorry
to
go
this
was
natural
so
far
as
several
were
concerned
but
rather
curious
as
regarded
those
of
the
family
who
knew
no
drawback
to
the
charms
of
the
place
i
suppose
it
was
due
to
some
instinctive
consciousness
of
the
influence
which
so
many
of
the
party
had
felt
it
impossible
to
resist
or
explain
and
the
rectory
at
raxtrew
was
really
a
dear
little
place
it
was
so
bright
and
open
and
sunny
dormy
pale
face
was
rosy
with
pleasure
the
first
afternoon
when
he
came
rushing
in
to
tell
us
that
there
were
tame
rabbits
and
a
pair
of
in
an
otherwise
empty
loose
box
in
the
do
come
and
look
at
them
he
begged
and
i
went
with
him
pleased
to
see
him
so
happy
i
did
not
care
for
the
rabbits
but
i
always
think
rather
fascinating
and
we
stayed
playing
with
them
some
little
time
i
show
you
another
way
back
into
the
house
said
dormy
and
he
led
me
through
a
conservatory
into
a
large
almost
unfurnished
room
opening
again
into
a
tiled
passage
leading
to
the
offices
this
is
the
warden
boys
playroom
he
said
they
keep
their
cricket
and
football
things
here
you
see
and
their
tricycle
i
wonder
if
i
might
use
it
we
must
write
and
ask
them
i
said
but
what
are
all
these
big
packages
i
went
on
oh
i
see
its
our
heavy
luggage
from
finster
there
is
not
room
in
this
house
for
our
odds
and
ends
of
furniture
i
suppose
it
rather
a
pity
they
have
put
it
in
here
for
we
could
have
had
some
nice
games
in
this
big
room
on
a
wet
day
and
see
dormy
here
are
several
pairs
of
roller
skates
oh
we
must
have
this
place
cleared
we
spoke
to
father
about
it
he
came
and
looked
at
the
room
and
agreed
with
us
that
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
have
the
full
use
of
it
roller
skating
would
be
good
exercise
for
dormy
he
said
and
even
for
nat
who
would
be
joining
us
before
long
for
his
holidays
so
our
big
cases
and
the
chairs
and
tables
we
had
bought
from
hunter
in
their
careful
swathings
of
wisps
and
matting
were
carried
out
to
an
empty
barn
a
perfectly
dry
and
barn
for
everything
at
the
rectory
was
in
excellent
repair
in
this
as
in
all
other
details
our
new
quarters
were
a
complete
contrast
to
the
picturesque
abode
we
had
just
quitted
the
weather
was
charming
for
the
first
two
or
three
weeks
much
warmer
and
sunnier
than
at
finster
we
all
enjoyed
it
and
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
miss
larpent
who
was
staying
through
the
holidays
this
year
and
i
congratulated
each
other
more
than
once
when
sure
of
not
being
overheard
on
the
cheerful
wholesome
atmosphere
in
which
we
found
ourselves
i
do
not
think
i
shall
ever
wish
to
live
in
a
very
old
house
again
she
said
one
day
we
were
in
the
and
i
had
been
persuading
her
to
try
her
hand
or
feet
at
roller
skating
even
now
she
went
on
i
own
to
you
leila
though
it
may
sound
very
i
can
not
think
of
that
horrible
night
without
a
shiver
indeed
i
could
fancy
i
feel
that
thrill
of
indescribable
cold
at
the
present
moment
she
shivering
and
extraordinary
to
relate
as
she
spoke
her
tremor
communicated
itself
to
me
again
i
could
swear
to
it
again
i
felt
that
blast
of
unutterable
unearthly
cold
i
started
up
we
were
seated
on
a
bench
against
the
wall
a
bench
belonging
to
the
and
which
we
had
not
thought
of
removing
as
a
few
seats
were
a
convenience
miss
larpent
caught
sight
of
my
face
her
own
which
was
very
white
grew
distressed
in
expression
she
grasped
my
arm
my
dearest
child
she
exclaimed
you
look
blue
and
your
teeth
are
chattering
i
do
wish
i
had
not
alluded
to
that
fright
we
had
i
had
no
idea
you
were
so
nervous
i
did
not
know
it
myself
i
replied
i
often
think
of
the
finster
ghost
quite
calmly
even
in
the
middle
of
the
night
but
just
then
miss
larpent
do
you
know
i
really
that
horrid
cold
again
so
did
i
or
rather
my
imagination
did
she
replied
trying
to
talk
in
a
way
she
got
up
as
she
spoke
and
went
to
the
window
it
ca
be
imagination
she
added
see
leila
what
a
gusty
stormy
day
it
is
not
like
the
beginning
of
august
it
really
is
cold
and
this
seems
nearly
as
draughty
as
the
gallery
at
finster
i
said
do
let
us
stay
here
come
into
the
and
play
some
duets
i
wish
we
could
quite
forget
about
finster
dormy
has
done
so
i
hope
said
miss
larpent
that
chilly
morning
was
the
commencement
of
the
real
in
the
weather
we
women
would
not
have
minded
it
so
much
as
there
are
always
plenty
of
indoor
things
we
can
find
to
do
and
my
two
brothers
were
away
raxtrew
held
no
particular
attractions
for
them
and
phil
wanted
to
see
some
of
our
numerous
relations
before
he
returned
to
india
so
he
and
nugent
started
on
a
round
of
visits
but
unluckily
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
public
school
holidays
and
poor
nat
the
boy
had
just
joined
us
it
was
very
disappointing
for
him
in
more
ways
than
one
he
had
set
his
heart
on
seeing
finster
impressed
by
our
enthusiastic
description
of
it
when
we
first
went
there
and
now
his
anticipations
had
to
come
down
to
a
comparatively
tame
and
uninteresting
village
and
every
probability
so
said
the
wise
of
a
stretch
of
rainy
unsummerlike
weather
nat
is
a
cheery
fellow
however
not
nearly
as
clever
or
as
impressionable
as
dormy
but
with
the
same
common
sense
so
he
wisely
determined
to
make
the
best
of
things
and
as
we
were
really
sorry
for
him
he
did
not
after
all
come
off
very
badly
his
principal
amusement
was
in
the
dormy
had
not
taken
to
it
in
the
same
way
the
greater
part
of
time
was
spent
with
the
rabbits
and
where
nat
when
he
himself
had
had
skating
enough
was
pretty
sure
to
find
him
i
suppose
it
is
with
being
the
eldest
sister
that
it
always
seems
my
fate
to
receive
the
confidences
of
the
rest
of
the
family
and
it
was
about
this
time
a
fortnight
or
so
after
his
arrival
that
it
began
to
strike
me
that
nat
looked
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
he
is
sure
to
tell
me
what
it
is
sooner
or
later
i
said
to
myself
probably
he
has
left
some
small
debts
behind
him
at
school
only
he
did
not
look
worried
or
anxious
when
he
first
came
home
the
confidence
was
given
one
afternoon
nat
followed
me
into
the
library
where
i
was
going
to
write
some
letters
and
said
he
wanted
to
speak
to
me
i
put
my
paper
aside
and
waited
leila
he
began
you
must
promise
not
to
laugh
at
me
this
was
not
what
i
expected
laugh
at
you
no
certainly
not
i
replied
especially
if
you
are
in
any
trouble
and
i
have
thought
you
were
looking
worried
nat
well
yes
he
said
i
do
know
if
there
is
anything
coming
over
me
i
feel
quite
well
but
leila
he
broke
off
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
i
started
has
any
one
i
was
beginning
rashly
but
the
boy
interrupted
me
no
no
he
said
eagerly
no
one
has
put
anything
of
the
kind
into
my
head
no
one
it
is
my
own
senses
that
have
seen
felt
it
or
else
if
it
is
fancy
i
must
be
going
out
of
my
mind
leila
i
do
believe
there
is
a
ghost
here
the
i
sat
silent
an
awful
dread
creeping
over
me
which
as
he
went
on
grew
worse
and
worse
had
the
thing
the
finster
shadow
attached
itself
to
us
i
had
read
of
such
cases
had
it
journeyed
with
us
to
this
peaceful
healthful
house
the
remembrance
of
the
cold
thrill
experienced
by
miss
larpent
and
myself
flashed
back
upon
me
and
nat
went
on
yes
the
cold
was
the
first
thing
he
had
been
startled
by
followed
just
as
in
the
gallery
of
our
old
castle
by
the
consciousness
of
the
terrible
presence
gradually
taking
form
in
the
moonlight
for
there
had
been
moonlight
the
last
night
or
two
and
nat
in
his
skating
ardour
had
amused
himself
alone
in
the
after
dormy
had
gone
to
bed
the
night
before
last
was
the
worst
he
said
it
stopped
raining
you
remember
leila
and
the
moon
was
very
bright
i
noticed
how
it
glistened
on
the
wet
leaves
outside
it
was
by
the
moonlight
i
saw
the
the
shadow
i
would
have
thought
of
skating
in
the
evening
but
for
the
light
for
we
never
had
a
lamp
in
there
it
came
round
the
walls
leila
and
then
it
seemed
to
stop
and
fumble
away
in
one
corner
at
the
end
where
there
is
a
bench
you
know
indeed
i
did
know
it
was
where
our
governess
and
i
had
been
sitting
i
got
so
awfully
frightened
said
nat
honestly
that
i
ran
off
then
yesterday
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
and
went
back
there
in
the
evening
with
a
candle
but
i
saw
nothing
the
moon
did
not
come
out
only
i
felt
the
cold
again
i
believe
it
was
there
though
i
could
not
see
it
leila
what
it
be
if
only
i
could
make
you
understand
it
is
so
worse
than
it
sounds
to
tell
i
said
what
i
could
to
soothe
him
i
spoke
of
odd
shadows
thrown
by
the
trees
outside
swaying
in
the
wind
for
the
weather
was
still
stormy
i
repeated
the
argument
about
optical
illusions
and
in
the
end
he
gave
in
a
little
it
have
been
his
fancy
and
he
promised
me
most
faithfully
to
breathe
no
hint
not
the
very
faintest
of
the
fright
he
had
had
to
sophy
or
dormy
or
any
one
then
i
had
to
tell
my
father
i
really
shrank
from
doing
so
but
there
seemed
no
alternative
at
first
of
course
he
it
at
once
by
saying
dormy
must
have
been
talking
to
nat
about
the
finster
business
or
if
not
dormy
miss
larpent
even
but
when
all
such
explanations
were
entirely
set
at
nought
i
must
say
poor
father
looked
rather
blank
i
was
sorry
for
him
and
sorry
for
myself
the
idea
of
being
by
this
horrible
presence
was
too
sickening
father
took
refuge
at
last
in
some
theory
involuntary
impressions
had
been
made
on
nat
by
all
of
us
whose
minds
were
still
full
of
the
strange
experience
he
said
he
felt
sure
and
no
doubt
he
tried
to
think
he
did
that
this
theory
explained
the
whole
i
felt
glad
for
him
to
get
any
satisfaction
out
of
it
and
i
did
my
best
to
take
it
up
too
but
it
was
no
use
i
felt
that
nat
experience
had
been
an
objective
one
as
miss
larpent
expressed
it
or
as
dormy
had
said
at
the
first
at
finster
no
no
sister
it
something
nothing
to
do
with
and
earnestly
i
longed
for
the
time
to
come
for
our
return
to
our
own
familiar
home
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
wish
to
leave
it
again
i
thought
but
after
a
week
or
two
the
feeling
began
to
fade
again
and
father
very
sensibly
discovered
that
it
would
not
do
to
leave
our
spare
furniture
and
heavy
luggage
in
the
barn
it
was
getting
all
dusty
and
cobwebby
so
it
was
all
moved
back
again
to
the
and
stacked
as
it
had
been
at
first
making
it
impossible
for
us
to
skate
or
amuse
ourselves
in
any
way
there
at
which
sophy
grumbled
but
nat
did
not
father
was
very
good
to
nat
he
took
him
about
with
him
as
much
as
he
could
to
get
the
thought
of
that
horrid
thing
out
of
his
head
but
yet
it
could
not
have
been
half
as
bad
for
nat
as
for
the
rest
of
us
for
we
took
the
greatest
possible
precautions
against
any
whisper
of
the
dreadful
and
mysterious
truth
reaching
him
that
the
ghost
had
from
finster
father
did
not
tell
mr
miles
or
jenny
about
it
they
had
been
worried
enough
poor
things
by
the
trouble
at
finster
and
it
would
be
too
bad
for
them
to
think
that
the
strange
influence
was
affecting
us
in
the
house
we
had
taken
at
their
recommendation
in
fact
said
father
with
a
rather
rueful
smile
if
we
do
take
care
we
shall
begin
to
be
looked
upon
askance
as
a
haunted
family
our
lives
would
have
been
in
danger
in
the
good
old
witchcraft
days
it
is
really
a
mercy
that
none
of
the
servants
have
got
hold
of
the
story
said
miss
larpent
who
was
one
of
our
council
of
three
we
must
just
hope
that
no
further
annoyance
will
befall
us
till
we
are
safe
at
home
again
her
hopes
were
fulfilled
nothing
else
happened
while
we
remained
at
the
rectory
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
unhappy
shade
was
limited
locally
in
one
sense
for
at
finster
even
it
had
never
been
seen
or
felt
save
in
the
one
room
the
vividness
of
the
impression
of
poor
nat
experience
had
almost
died
away
when
the
time
came
for
us
to
leave
i
felt
now
that
i
should
rather
enjoy
telling
phil
and
nugent
about
it
and
hearing
what
could
bring
forward
in
the
way
of
explanation
we
left
raxtrew
early
in
october
our
two
big
brothers
were
awaiting
us
at
home
having
arrived
there
a
few
days
before
us
nugent
was
due
at
oxford
very
shortly
it
was
very
nice
to
be
in
our
own
house
again
after
several
absence
and
it
was
most
interesting
to
see
how
the
alterations
including
a
good
deal
of
new
papering
and
painting
had
been
carried
out
and
as
soon
as
the
heavy
luggage
arrived
we
had
grand
consultations
as
to
the
disposal
about
the
rooms
of
the
charming
pieces
of
furniture
we
had
picked
up
at
hunter
our
rooms
are
large
and
nicely
shaped
most
of
them
it
was
not
difficult
to
make
a
pretty
corner
here
and
there
with
a
quaint
old
chair
or
two
and
a
delicate
table
and
when
we
had
arranged
them
all
phil
nugent
and
i
were
the
movers
we
summoned
mother
and
miss
larpent
to
give
their
opinion
they
quite
approved
mother
even
saying
that
she
would
be
glad
of
a
few
more
odds
and
ends
we
might
empower
janet
miles
she
said
to
let
us
know
if
she
sees
anything
very
tempting
is
that
really
all
we
have
they
looked
so
much
more
important
in
their
swathings
the
same
idea
struck
me
i
glanced
round
yes
i
said
that
all
except
oh
yes
there
are
the
tapestry
the
best
of
all
we
ca
have
them
in
the
i
fear
it
is
too
modern
for
them
where
shall
we
hang
them
you
are
forgetting
leila
said
mother
we
spoke
of
having
them
in
the
hall
they
will
do
beautifully
to
hang
before
the
two
side
doors
which
are
seldom
opened
and
in
cold
weather
the
hall
is
draughty
though
nothing
like
the
gallery
at
finster
why
did
she
say
that
it
made
me
shiver
but
then
of
course
she
did
not
know
our
hall
is
a
very
pleasant
one
we
sit
there
a
great
deal
the
side
doors
mother
spoke
of
are
second
entrances
to
the
and
library
quite
unnecessary
except
when
we
have
a
large
party
a
dance
or
something
of
that
sort
and
the
certainly
seemed
the
very
thing
the
mellow
colouring
of
the
tapestry
showing
to
great
advantage
the
boys
phil
and
nugent
i
mean
set
to
work
at
once
and
in
an
hour
or
two
the
hangings
were
placed
of
course
said
philip
if
ever
these
doors
are
to
be
opened
this
precious
tapestry
must
be
taken
down
or
very
carefully
looped
back
it
is
very
worn
in
some
places
and
in
spite
of
the
thick
lining
it
should
be
tenderly
handled
i
am
afraid
it
has
suffered
a
little
from
being
so
long
rolled
up
at
the
rectory
it
should
have
been
hung
up
still
it
looked
very
well
indeed
and
when
father
who
was
away
at
some
magistrates
meeting
came
home
that
afternoon
i
showed
him
our
arrangements
with
pride
he
was
very
pleased
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
he
said
though
it
was
almost
too
dusk
for
him
to
judge
quite
fully
of
the
effect
of
the
tapestry
but
dear
me
child
this
hall
is
very
cold
we
must
have
a
larger
fire
only
october
what
sort
of
a
winter
are
we
going
to
have
he
shivered
as
he
spoke
he
was
standing
close
to
one
of
the
smoothing
the
tapestry
half
absently
with
one
hand
i
looked
at
him
with
concern
i
you
have
not
got
a
chill
papa
i
said
but
he
seemed
all
right
again
when
we
went
into
the
library
where
tea
was
waiting
an
extra
late
tea
for
his
benefit
the
next
day
nugent
went
to
oxford
nat
had
already
returned
to
school
so
our
home
party
was
reduced
to
father
and
mother
miss
larpent
phil
and
i
and
the
children
we
were
very
glad
to
have
phil
settled
at
home
for
some
time
there
was
little
fear
of
his
being
tempted
away
now
that
the
shooting
had
begun
we
were
expecting
some
of
our
usual
guests
at
this
season
the
weather
was
perfect
autumn
weather
we
had
thrown
off
all
remembrance
of
influenza
and
other
depressing
influences
and
were
feeling
bright
and
cheerful
when
again
ah
yes
even
now
it
gives
me
a
faint
sick
sensation
to
recall
the
horror
of
that
visitation
but
i
must
tell
it
simply
and
not
give
way
to
painful
remembrances
it
was
the
very
day
before
our
first
visitors
were
expected
that
the
blow
fell
the
awful
fear
made
itself
felt
and
as
before
the
victim
was
a
new
one
the
one
who
for
reasons
already
mentioned
we
had
specially
guarded
from
any
breath
of
the
gruesome
terror
poor
little
sophy
what
she
was
doing
alone
in
the
hall
late
that
evening
i
can
not
quite
recall
yes
i
think
i
remember
her
saying
she
had
run
downstairs
when
up
to
bed
to
fetch
a
book
she
had
left
there
in
the
afternoon
she
had
no
light
and
the
one
lamp
in
the
hall
we
never
sat
there
after
dinner
was
burning
feebly
was
bright
i
was
sitting
at
the
piano
where
i
had
been
playing
in
a
rather
sleepy
way
when
a
sudden
touch
on
my
shoulder
made
me
start
and
looking
up
i
saw
my
sister
standing
beside
me
white
and
trembling
leila
she
whispered
come
with
me
quickly
i
do
want
mamma
to
notice
for
mother
was
still
nervous
and
delicate
the
is
very
long
and
has
two
or
three
doors
else
was
at
our
end
it
was
easy
to
make
our
way
out
unperceived
sophy
caught
my
hand
and
hurried
me
upstairs
without
speaking
till
we
reached
my
own
room
where
a
bright
fire
was
burning
cheerfully
then
she
began
leila
she
said
i
have
had
such
an
awful
fright
i
did
not
want
to
speak
until
we
were
safe
up
here
what
was
it
i
exclaimed
breathlessly
did
i
already
suspect
the
truth
i
really
do
not
know
but
my
nerves
were
not
what
they
had
been
sophy
gasped
and
began
to
tremble
i
put
my
arm
round
her
it
does
not
sound
so
bad
she
said
but
oh
leila
what
it
be
it
was
in
the
hall
and
then
i
think
she
explained
how
she
had
come
to
be
there
i
was
standing
near
the
side
door
into
the
library
that
we
never
use
and
all
of
a
sudden
a
sort
of
darkness
came
along
the
wall
and
seemed
to
settle
on
the
door
where
the
old
tapestry
is
you
know
i
thought
it
was
the
shadow
of
something
outside
for
it
was
bright
moonlight
and
the
windows
were
not
shuttered
but
in
a
moment
i
saw
it
could
not
be
that
there
is
nothing
to
throw
such
a
shadow
it
seemed
to
wriggle
about
like
like
a
monstrous
spider
or
and
there
she
hesitated
almost
like
a
deformed
sort
of
human
being
and
all
at
once
leila
my
breath
went
and
i
fell
down
i
really
did
i
was
with
cold
i
think
my
senses
went
away
but
i
am
not
sure
the
next
thing
i
remember
was
rushing
across
the
hall
and
then
down
the
south
corridor
to
the
and
then
i
was
so
thankful
to
see
you
there
by
the
piano
i
drew
her
down
on
my
knee
poor
child
it
was
very
good
of
you
dear
i
said
to
control
yourself
and
not
startle
mamma
this
pleased
her
but
her
terror
was
still
uppermost
leila
she
said
piteously
ca
you
explain
it
i
did
so
hope
you
could
what
i
say
i
one
would
need
to
go
to
the
hall
and
look
well
about
to
see
what
could
cast
such
a
shadow
i
said
vaguely
and
i
suppose
i
must
involuntarily
have
moved
a
little
for
sophy
started
and
clutched
me
fast
oh
leila
do
go
you
do
mean
you
are
going
now
she
entreated
nothing
truly
was
farther
from
my
thoughts
but
i
took
care
not
to
say
so
i
wo
leave
you
if
you
rather
not
i
said
and
i
tell
you
what
sophy
if
you
would
like
very
much
to
sleep
here
with
me
you
shall
i
will
ring
and
tell
freake
to
bring
your
things
down
and
undress
you
on
one
condition
what
she
said
eagerly
she
was
much
impressed
by
my
amiability
that
you
wo
say
about
this
or
give
the
least
shadow
of
a
hint
to
any
one
that
you
have
had
a
fright
you
do
know
the
trouble
it
will
cause
of
course
i
will
promise
to
let
no
one
know
if
you
think
it
better
for
you
are
so
kind
to
me
said
sophy
but
there
was
a
touch
of
reluctance
in
her
tone
you
you
mean
to
do
something
about
it
though
leila
she
went
on
i
shall
never
be
able
to
forget
it
if
you
do
yes
i
said
i
shall
speak
to
father
and
phil
about
it
if
any
one
has
been
trying
to
frighten
us
i
added
unguardedly
by
playing
tricks
they
certainly
must
be
exposed
not
she
corrected
it
was
only
me
and
i
did
not
reply
why
i
spoke
of
the
possibility
of
a
trick
i
scarcely
know
i
had
no
hope
of
any
such
explanation
but
another
strange
almost
incredible
idea
was
beginning
to
take
shape
in
my
mind
and
with
it
came
a
faint
very
faint
touch
of
relief
could
it
be
not
the
nor
the
nor
worst
of
all
we
ourselves
that
were
haunted
but
something
or
things
among
the
old
furniture
we
had
bought
at
raxtrew
and
lying
sleepless
that
night
a
sudden
flash
of
illumination
struck
me
could
it
whatever
the
it
was
could
it
have
something
to
do
with
the
tapestry
hangings
the
more
i
thought
it
over
the
more
striking
grew
the
coincidences
at
finster
it
had
been
on
one
of
the
closed
doors
that
the
shadow
seemed
to
settle
as
again
here
in
our
own
hall
but
in
both
cases
the
had
hung
in
front
and
at
the
rectory
the
tapestry
as
philip
had
remarked
had
been
there
rolled
up
all
the
time
was
it
possible
that
it
had
never
been
taken
out
to
the
barn
at
all
what
probable
than
that
it
should
have
been
left
forgotten
under
the
bench
where
miss
larpent
and
i
had
felt
for
the
second
time
that
hideous
cold
and
stay
something
else
was
returning
to
my
mind
in
connection
with
that
bench
yes
i
had
it
nat
had
said
it
seemed
to
stop
and
fumble
away
in
one
corner
at
the
end
where
there
is
a
bench
you
know
and
then
to
my
unutterable
thankfulness
at
last
i
fell
asleep
part
iv
i
told
philip
the
next
morning
there
was
no
need
to
bespeak
his
attention
i
think
he
felt
nearly
as
horrified
as
i
had
done
myself
at
the
idea
that
our
own
hitherto
bright
cheerful
home
was
to
be
haunted
by
this
awful
thing
influence
or
presence
call
it
what
you
will
and
the
suggestions
which
i
went
on
to
make
struck
him
too
with
a
sense
of
relief
he
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
after
making
me
recapitulate
as
precisely
as
possible
every
detail
of
sophy
story
you
are
sure
it
was
the
door
into
the
library
he
said
at
last
quite
sure
i
replied
and
oh
philip
i
went
on
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
felt
a
chill
there
the
other
evening
for
till
that
moment
the
little
incident
in
question
had
escaped
my
memory
do
you
remember
which
of
the
hung
in
front
of
the
door
at
finster
said
philip
i
shook
my
head
dormy
would
i
said
he
used
to
examine
the
pictures
in
the
tapestry
with
great
interest
i
should
not
know
one
from
the
other
there
is
an
old
castle
in
the
distance
in
each
and
a
lot
of
trees
and
something
meant
for
a
lake
but
in
his
turn
philip
shook
his
head
no
he
said
i
wo
speak
to
dormy
about
it
if
i
can
possibly
help
it
leave
it
to
me
leila
and
try
to
put
it
out
of
your
own
mind
as
much
as
you
possibly
can
and
do
be
surprised
at
anything
you
may
notice
in
the
next
few
days
i
will
tell
you
first
of
any
one
whenever
i
have
anything
to
tell
that
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
so
i
took
his
advice
luckily
as
it
turned
out
mr
miles
the
only
outsider
so
to
say
except
the
unfortunate
keeper
who
had
witnessed
the
ghostly
drama
was
one
of
the
shooting
party
expected
that
day
and
him
philip
at
once
determined
to
consult
about
this
new
and
utterly
unexpected
manifestation
he
did
not
tell
me
this
indeed
it
was
not
till
fully
a
week
later
that
i
heard
anything
and
then
in
a
letter
a
very
long
letter
from
my
brother
which
i
think
will
relate
the
sequel
of
our
strange
ghost
story
better
than
any
narration
at
of
my
own
mr
miles
only
stayed
two
nights
with
us
the
very
day
after
he
came
he
announced
that
to
his
great
regret
he
was
obliged
most
unexpectedly
to
return
to
raxtrew
on
important
business
and
he
continued
i
am
afraid
you
will
all
feel
much
more
vexed
with
me
when
i
tell
you
i
am
going
to
carry
off
phil
with
me
father
looked
very
blank
indeed
phil
he
exclaimed
and
how
about
our
shooting
you
can
easily
replace
us
said
my
brother
i
have
thought
of
that
and
he
added
something
in
a
lower
tone
to
father
he
phil
was
leaving
the
room
at
the
time
thought
it
had
reference
to
the
real
reason
of
his
accompanying
mr
miles
but
i
was
mistaken
father
however
said
nothing
more
in
opposition
to
the
plan
and
the
next
morning
the
two
went
off
we
happened
to
be
standing
at
the
hall
door
several
of
us
for
we
were
a
large
party
now
when
phil
and
his
friend
drove
away
as
we
turned
to
the
house
i
felt
some
one
touch
me
it
was
sophy
she
was
going
out
for
a
constitutional
with
miss
larpent
but
had
stopped
a
moment
to
speak
to
me
leila
she
said
in
a
whisper
why
have
they
did
you
know
that
the
tapestry
had
been
taken
down
she
glanced
at
me
with
a
peculiar
expression
i
had
not
observed
it
now
looking
up
i
saw
that
the
two
locked
doors
were
visible
in
the
dark
polish
of
their
old
mahogany
as
of
yore
no
longer
shrouded
by
the
ancient
i
started
in
surprise
no
i
whispered
in
return
i
did
not
know
never
mind
sophy
i
suspect
there
is
a
reason
for
it
which
we
shall
know
in
good
time
i
felt
strongly
tempted
the
moon
being
still
at
the
full
to
visit
the
hall
that
night
in
hopes
of
feeling
and
seeing
but
when
the
time
drew
near
my
courage
failed
besides
i
had
tacitly
promised
philip
to
think
as
little
as
i
possibly
could
about
the
matter
and
any
vigil
of
the
kind
would
certainly
not
have
been
acting
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
his
advice
i
think
i
will
now
copy
as
it
stands
the
letter
from
philip
which
i
received
a
week
or
so
later
it
was
dated
from
his
club
in
london
my
dear
leila
i
have
a
long
story
to
tell
you
and
a
very
extraordinary
one
i
think
it
is
well
that
it
should
be
put
into
writing
so
i
will
devote
this
evening
to
the
task
especially
as
i
shall
not
be
home
for
ten
days
or
so
you
may
have
suspected
that
i
took
miles
into
my
confidence
as
soon
as
he
arrived
if
you
did
you
were
right
he
was
the
best
person
to
speak
to
for
several
reasons
he
looked
i
must
say
rather
well
scarcely
expresses
it
when
i
told
him
of
the
ghost
not
only
at
the
rectory
but
in
our
own
house
and
on
both
occasions
to
persons
nat
and
then
sophy
who
had
not
heard
a
breath
of
the
story
but
when
i
went
on
to
propound
your
suggestion
miles
cheered
up
he
had
been
i
fancy
a
trifle
touchy
about
our
calling
finster
haunted
and
it
was
evidently
a
satisfaction
to
him
to
start
another
theory
we
talked
it
well
over
and
we
decided
to
test
the
thing
again
it
took
some
resolution
i
own
to
do
so
we
sat
up
that
night
bright
moonlight
luckily
and
well
i
repeat
it
all
sophy
was
quite
correct
it
came
again
the
horrid
creeping
shadow
poor
wretch
i
rather
sorry
for
it
now
just
in
the
old
way
quite
as
much
at
home
in
shire
apparently
as
in
the
castle
it
stopped
at
the
closed
library
door
and
fumbled
away
then
started
off
again
ugh
we
watched
it
closely
but
kept
well
in
the
middle
of
the
room
so
that
the
cold
did
not
strike
us
so
badly
we
both
noted
the
special
part
of
the
tapestry
where
its
hands
seemed
to
sprawl
and
we
meant
to
stay
for
another
round
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
we
funked
it
and
went
to
bed
next
morning
on
pretence
of
examining
the
date
of
the
tapestry
we
had
it
down
you
were
all
out
and
we
found
just
where
the
hands
felt
about
there
had
been
a
cut
three
cuts
three
sides
of
a
square
as
it
were
making
a
sort
of
door
in
the
stuff
the
fourth
side
having
evidently
acted
as
a
hinge
for
there
was
a
mark
where
it
had
been
folded
back
and
just
where
treating
the
thing
as
a
door
you
might
expect
to
find
a
handle
to
open
it
by
we
found
a
distinct
dint
in
the
tapestry
as
if
a
button
or
knob
had
once
been
there
we
looked
at
each
other
the
same
idea
had
struck
us
the
tapestry
had
been
used
to
conceal
a
small
door
in
the
wall
the
door
of
a
secret
cupboard
probably
the
ghostly
fingers
had
been
vainly
seeking
for
the
spring
which
in
the
days
of
their
flesh
and
bone
they
had
been
accustomed
to
press
first
thing
to
do
said
miles
to
look
up
hunter
and
make
him
tell
where
he
got
the
tapestry
from
then
we
shall
see
we
take
the
with
us
i
said
but
miles
shuddered
though
he
half
laughed
too
thank
you
he
said
not
going
to
travel
with
the
evil
thing
ca
hang
it
up
again
though
i
said
this
last
experience
in
the
end
we
rolled
up
the
two
not
to
attract
attention
by
only
moving
one
and
well
i
thought
it
just
possible
the
ghost
might
make
a
mistake
and
i
did
not
want
any
more
scares
while
i
was
away
we
rolled
them
up
together
first
carefully
measuring
the
cut
and
its
position
in
the
curtain
and
then
we
hid
them
away
in
one
of
the
lofts
that
no
one
ever
enters
where
they
are
at
this
moment
and
where
the
ghost
may
have
been
disporting
himself
for
all
i
know
though
i
fancy
he
has
given
it
up
by
this
time
for
reasons
you
shall
hear
then
miles
and
i
as
you
know
set
off
for
raxtrew
i
smoothed
my
father
down
about
it
by
reminding
him
how
they
had
been
to
us
and
telling
him
miles
really
needed
me
we
went
straight
to
hunter
he
hummed
and
hawed
a
good
deal
he
had
not
distinctly
promised
not
to
give
the
name
of
the
place
the
tapestry
had
come
from
but
he
knew
the
gentleman
he
had
bought
it
from
did
not
want
it
known
said
miles
it
some
family
that
has
come
down
in
the
world
and
is
forced
to
part
with
things
to
get
some
ready
money
dear
no
said
hunter
is
not
that
at
all
it
was
only
that
i
suppose
i
must
give
you
the
name
captain
devereux
did
not
want
any
gossip
to
get
about
as
to
repeated
miles
do
mean
the
people
at
hallinger
same
said
hunter
you
know
them
sir
you
will
be
careful
i
hope
to
assure
the
captain
that
i
did
my
best
to
carry
out
his
wishes
said
miles
exonerate
you
and
then
hunter
told
us
that
devereux
who
only
came
into
the
hallinger
property
a
few
years
ago
had
been
much
annoyed
by
stories
getting
about
of
the
place
being
haunted
and
this
had
led
to
his
dismantling
one
wing
and
hunter
thought
but
was
not
quite
clear
as
to
this
pulling
down
some
rooms
altogether
but
he
devereux
was
very
touchy
on
the
subject
he
did
not
want
to
be
laughed
at
the
tapestry
came
from
him
you
are
certain
as
to
that
miles
repeated
sir
i
took
it
down
with
my
own
hands
it
was
fitted
on
to
two
panels
in
what
they
call
the
round
room
at
hallinger
there
were
oh
i
daresay
a
dozen
of
them
with
tapestry
nailed
on
but
i
only
bought
these
two
pieces
the
others
were
sold
to
a
london
dealer
round
room
i
said
leila
the
expression
struck
me
miles
it
appeared
knew
devereux
fairly
well
hallinger
is
only
ten
miles
off
we
drove
over
there
but
found
he
was
in
london
so
our
next
move
was
to
follow
him
there
we
called
twice
at
his
club
and
then
miles
made
an
appointment
saying
that
he
wanted
to
see
him
on
private
business
he
received
us
civilly
of
course
he
is
quite
a
young
fellow
in
the
guards
but
when
miles
began
to
explain
to
him
what
we
had
come
about
he
stiffened
suppose
you
belong
to
the
psychical
society
he
said
can
only
repeat
that
i
have
nothing
to
tell
and
i
detest
the
whole
subject
a
moment
said
miles
and
as
he
went
on
i
saw
that
devereux
changed
his
face
grew
intent
with
interest
and
a
queer
sort
of
eagerness
and
at
last
he
started
to
his
feet
my
soul
he
said
believe
you
run
him
to
earth
for
me
the
ghost
i
mean
and
if
so
you
shall
have
my
endless
gratitude
i
go
down
to
hallinger
with
you
at
once
this
afternoon
if
you
like
and
see
it
out
he
was
so
excited
that
he
spoke
almost
incoherently
but
after
a
bit
he
calmed
down
and
told
us
all
he
had
to
tell
and
that
was
a
good
deal
which
would
indeed
have
been
nuts
for
the
psychical
society
what
hunter
had
said
was
but
a
small
part
of
the
whole
it
appeared
that
on
succeeding
to
hallinger
on
the
death
of
an
uncle
young
devereux
had
made
considerable
changes
in
the
house
he
had
among
others
opened
out
a
small
wing
a
sort
of
round
tower
which
had
been
completely
dismantled
and
bricked
up
for
i
think
he
said
over
a
hundred
years
there
was
some
story
about
it
an
ancestor
of
his
an
awful
gambler
had
used
the
principal
room
in
this
wing
for
his
orgies
very
queer
things
went
on
there
the
finish
up
being
the
finding
of
old
devereux
dead
there
one
night
when
his
servants
were
summoned
by
the
man
he
had
been
playing
with
with
whom
he
had
had
an
awful
quarrel
this
man
a
low
fellow
probably
a
professional
cardsharper
vowed
that
he
had
been
robbed
of
a
jewel
which
his
host
had
staked
and
it
was
said
that
a
ring
of
great
value
had
disappeared
but
it
was
all
hushed
up
devereux
had
really
died
in
a
fit
though
soon
after
for
reasons
only
hinted
at
the
round
tower
was
shut
up
till
the
present
man
rashly
opened
it
again
almost
at
once
he
said
the
annoyances
to
use
a
mild
term
began
first
one
then
another
of
the
household
were
terrified
out
of
their
wits
just
as
we
were
leila
devereux
himself
had
seen
it
two
or
three
times
the
of
course
being
his
miserable
old
ancestor
a
small
man
with
a
big
wig
and
long
thin
fingers
it
all
corresponded
devereux
is
young
and
nervous
she
could
not
stand
it
so
in
the
end
the
round
tower
was
shut
up
again
all
the
furniture
and
hangings
sold
and
locally
speaking
the
ghost
laid
that
was
all
devereux
knew
we
started
the
three
of
us
that
very
afternoon
as
excited
as
a
party
of
schoolboys
miles
and
i
kept
questioning
devereux
but
he
had
really
no
more
to
tell
he
had
never
thought
of
examining
the
walls
of
the
haunted
room
it
was
wainscotted
he
said
and
might
be
lined
all
through
with
secret
cupboards
for
all
he
knew
but
he
could
not
get
over
the
extraordinariness
of
the
ghost
sticking
to
the
and
indeed
it
does
rather
lower
one
idea
of
ghostly
intelligence
we
went
at
it
at
once
the
tower
was
not
up
again
luckily
we
got
in
without
difficulty
the
next
morning
devereux
making
some
excuse
to
the
servants
a
new
set
who
had
not
heard
of
the
ghost
for
our
eccentric
proceedings
it
was
a
tiresome
business
there
were
so
many
panels
in
the
room
as
hunter
had
said
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
in
which
tapestry
had
been
fixed
but
we
had
our
measures
and
we
carefully
marked
a
line
as
near
as
we
could
guess
at
the
height
from
the
floor
that
the
cut
in
the
must
have
been
then
we
tapped
and
pummelled
and
pressed
imaginary
springs
till
we
were
nearly
sick
of
it
there
was
nothing
to
guide
us
the
wainscotting
was
dark
and
much
shrunk
and
marked
with
age
and
full
of
joins
in
the
wood
any
one
of
which
might
have
meant
a
door
it
was
devereux
himself
who
found
it
at
last
we
heard
an
exclamation
from
where
he
was
standing
by
himself
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
was
quite
white
and
shaky
here
he
said
and
we
looked
yes
there
was
a
small
deep
recess
or
cupboard
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
excellently
contrived
devereux
had
touched
the
spring
at
last
and
the
door
just
matching
the
cut
in
the
tapestry
flew
open
inside
lay
what
at
first
we
took
for
a
packet
of
letters
and
i
hoped
to
myself
they
contained
nothing
that
would
bring
trouble
on
poor
devereux
they
were
not
letters
however
but
two
or
three
incomplete
packs
of
cards
grey
and
with
age
and
as
miles
spread
them
out
certain
markings
on
them
told
their
own
tale
devereux
did
not
like
it
naturally
their
supposed
owner
had
been
a
member
of
his
house
ghost
has
kept
a
conscience
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
a
laugh
there
nothing
more
yes
a
small
leather
bag
black
and
grimy
though
originally
i
fancy
of
chamois
skin
it
drew
with
strings
devereux
pulled
it
open
and
felt
inside
george
he
exclaimed
and
he
held
out
the
most
magnificent
diamond
ring
i
have
ever
seen
sparkling
away
as
if
it
had
only
just
come
from
the
polisher
must
be
ring
he
said
and
we
all
stared
too
astonished
to
speak
devereux
closed
the
cupboard
again
after
carefully
examining
it
to
make
sure
nothing
had
been
left
behind
he
marked
the
exact
spot
where
he
had
pressed
the
spring
so
as
to
find
it
at
any
time
then
we
all
left
the
round
room
locking
the
door
securely
after
us
miles
and
i
spent
that
night
at
hallinger
we
sat
up
late
talking
it
all
over
there
are
some
queer
inconsistencies
about
the
thing
which
will
probably
never
be
explained
first
and
foremost
why
has
the
ghost
stuck
to
the
tapestry
instead
of
to
the
actual
spot
he
seemed
to
have
wished
to
reveal
secondly
what
was
the
connection
between
his
visits
and
the
full
moon
or
is
it
that
only
by
the
moonlight
the
shade
becomes
perceptible
to
human
sense
who
can
say
as
to
the
story
itself
what
was
old
devereux
motive
in
concealing
his
own
ring
were
the
marked
cards
his
or
his
opponent
of
which
he
had
managed
to
possess
himself
and
had
secreted
as
testimony
against
the
other
fellow
i
incline
and
so
does
miles
to
this
last
theory
and
when
we
suggested
it
to
devereux
i
could
see
it
was
a
relief
to
him
after
all
one
likes
to
think
one
ancestors
were
gentlemen
what
then
has
he
been
worrying
about
all
this
century
or
more
he
said
it
were
that
he
wanted
the
ring
returned
to
its
real
owner
supposing
the
fellow
won
it
i
could
understand
it
though
such
a
thing
would
be
impossible
there
is
no
record
of
the
man
at
all
his
name
was
never
mentioned
in
the
story
may
want
the
ring
restored
to
its
proper
owner
all
the
same
said
miles
are
its
owner
as
the
head
of
the
family
and
it
has
been
your
ancestor
fault
that
it
has
been
hidden
all
these
years
besides
we
can
not
take
upon
ourselves
to
explain
motives
in
such
a
case
perhaps
who
knows
the
poor
shade
could
not
help
himself
his
peregrinations
may
have
been
of
the
nature
of
punishment
hope
they
are
over
now
said
devereux
his
sake
and
everybody
else
i
should
be
glad
to
think
he
wanted
the
ring
restored
to
us
but
besides
that
i
should
like
to
do
something
something
you
know
if
it
would
make
him
easier
poor
old
chap
i
must
consult
lilias
lilias
is
devereux
this
is
all
i
have
to
tell
you
at
present
leila
when
i
come
home
we
have
the
up
again
and
see
what
happens
i
want
you
now
to
read
all
this
to
my
father
and
if
he
has
no
objection
he
and
my
mother
of
course
i
should
like
to
invite
captain
and
devereux
to
stay
a
few
days
with
us
as
well
as
miles
as
soon
as
i
come
back
philip
wish
was
acceded
to
it
was
with
no
little
anxiety
and
interest
that
we
awaited
his
return
the
tapestry
were
restored
to
their
place
and
on
the
first
moonlight
night
my
father
philip
captain
devereux
and
mr
miles
held
their
vigil
what
happened
the
peaceful
rays
lighted
up
the
quaint
landscape
of
the
tapestry
undisturbed
by
the
poor
groping
fingers
no
gruesome
unearthly
chill
as
of
worse
than
death
made
itself
felt
to
the
midnight
watchers
the
weary
may
we
not
hope
repentant
spirit
was
at
rest
at
last
and
never
since
has
any
one
been
troubled
by
the
shadow
in
the
moonlight
i
can
not
help
hoping
said
devereux
when
talking
it
over
that
what
michael
has
done
may
have
helped
to
calm
the
poor
ghost
and
she
told
us
what
it
was
captain
devereux
is
rich
though
not
immensely
so
he
had
the
ring
valued
it
represented
a
very
large
sum
but
philip
says
i
had
better
not
name
the
figures
and
then
he
so
to
say
bought
it
from
himself
and
with
this
money
he
no
again
phil
says
i
must
not
enter
into
particulars
beyond
saying
that
with
it
he
did
something
very
good
and
very
useful
which
had
long
been
a
pet
scheme
of
his
wife
sophy
is
grown
up
now
and
she
knows
the
whole
story
so
does
our
mother
and
dormy
too
has
heard
it
all
the
horror
of
it
has
quite
gone
we
feel
rather
proud
of
having
been
the
actual
witnesses
of
a
ghostly
drama
the
man
with
the
cough
i
am
a
german
by
birth
and
descent
my
name
is
schmidt
but
by
education
i
am
quite
as
much
an
englishman
as
a
deutscher
and
by
affection
much
more
the
former
my
life
has
been
spent
pretty
equally
between
the
two
countries
and
i
flatter
myself
i
speak
both
languages
without
any
foreign
accent
i
count
england
my
headquarters
now
it
is
home
to
me
but
a
few
years
ago
i
was
resident
in
germany
only
going
over
to
london
now
and
then
on
business
i
will
not
mention
the
town
where
i
lived
it
is
unnecessary
to
do
so
and
in
the
peculiar
experience
i
am
about
to
relate
i
think
real
names
of
people
and
places
are
just
as
well
or
better
avoided
i
was
connected
with
a
large
and
important
firm
of
engineers
i
had
been
bred
up
to
the
profession
and
was
credited
with
a
certain
amount
of
talent
and
i
was
considered
and
with
all
modesty
i
think
i
deserved
the
opinion
steady
and
reliable
so
that
i
had
already
attained
a
fair
position
in
the
house
and
was
looked
upon
as
a
rising
man
but
i
was
still
young
and
not
quite
so
wise
as
i
thought
myself
i
came
very
near
once
to
making
a
great
mess
of
a
certain
affair
it
is
this
story
which
i
am
going
to
tell
our
house
went
in
largely
for
patents
rather
too
largely
some
thought
but
the
head
partner
son
was
a
bit
of
a
genius
in
his
way
and
his
father
was
growing
old
and
let
herr
wilhelm
moritz
we
will
call
the
family
name
do
pretty
much
as
he
chose
and
on
the
whole
herr
wilhelm
did
well
he
was
cautious
and
he
had
the
benefit
of
the
still
greater
caution
and
larger
experience
of
herr
gerhardt
the
second
partner
in
the
firm
patents
and
the
laws
which
regulate
them
are
queer
things
to
have
to
do
with
no
one
who
has
not
had
personal
experience
of
the
complications
that
arise
could
believe
how
far
these
spread
and
how
entangled
they
become
great
acuteness
as
well
as
caution
is
called
for
if
you
would
guide
your
patent
bark
safely
to
port
and
perhaps
more
than
anything
a
power
of
holding
your
tongue
i
was
no
chatterbox
nor
when
on
a
mission
of
importance
did
i
go
about
looking
as
if
i
were
bursting
with
secrets
which
is
in
my
opinion
almost
as
dangerous
as
revealing
them
no
one
to
meet
me
on
the
journeys
which
it
often
fell
to
my
lot
to
undertake
would
have
guessed
that
i
had
anything
on
my
mind
but
an
young
fellow
natural
interest
in
his
surroundings
though
many
a
time
i
have
stayed
awake
through
a
whole
night
of
railway
travel
if
at
all
doubtful
about
my
or
not
dared
to
go
to
sleep
in
a
hotel
without
a
revolver
by
my
pillow
for
now
and
then
though
not
through
me
our
secrets
did
ooze
out
and
if
as
happened
they
were
secrets
connected
with
government
orders
or
contracts
there
was
or
but
for
the
exertion
of
the
greatest
energy
and
tact
on
the
part
of
my
superiors
there
have
been
to
put
it
plainly
the
devil
to
pay
one
morning
it
was
nearing
the
end
of
november
i
was
sent
for
to
herr
wilhelm
private
room
there
i
found
him
and
herr
gerhardt
before
a
table
spread
with
papers
covered
with
figures
and
calculations
and
sheets
of
beautifully
executed
diagrams
lutz
said
herr
wilhelm
he
had
known
me
from
childhood
and
often
called
me
by
the
abbreviation
of
my
christian
name
which
is
ludwig
or
louis
lutz
we
are
going
to
confide
to
you
a
matter
of
extreme
importance
you
must
be
prepared
to
start
for
london
all
right
sir
i
said
i
shall
be
ready
you
will
take
the
express
through
to
calais
on
the
whole
it
is
the
best
route
especially
at
this
season
by
travelling
all
night
you
will
catch
the
boat
there
and
arrive
in
london
so
as
to
have
a
good
rest
and
be
for
work
the
next
morning
i
bowed
agreement
but
ventured
to
make
a
suggestion
if
as
i
infer
the
matter
is
one
of
great
importance
i
said
would
it
not
be
well
for
me
to
start
sooner
i
can
yes
throwing
a
rapid
survey
over
the
work
i
had
before
me
for
the
next
two
days
i
can
be
ready
herr
wilhelm
looked
at
herr
gerhardt
herr
gerhardt
shook
his
head
no
he
replied
it
must
be
and
then
he
proceeded
to
explain
to
me
why
i
need
not
attempt
to
give
all
the
details
of
the
matter
with
which
i
was
entrusted
indeed
to
lay
readers
it
would
be
impossible
suffice
it
to
say
the
whole
concerned
a
patent
that
of
a
very
remarkable
and
wonderful
invention
which
it
was
hoped
and
believed
the
governments
of
both
countries
would
take
up
but
to
secure
this
being
done
in
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
manner
it
was
necessary
that
our
firm
should
go
about
it
in
concert
with
an
english
house
of
standing
to
this
house
the
firm
of
bluestone
and
fagg
i
will
call
them
i
was
to
be
sent
with
full
explanations
and
the
next
or
more
passed
in
my
superiors
going
minutely
into
the
details
so
as
to
satisfy
themselves
that
i
understood
the
mastering
of
the
whole
was
not
difficult
for
i
was
well
grounded
technically
and
like
many
of
the
best
things
the
idea
was
essentially
simple
and
the
diagrams
were
perfect
when
the
explanations
were
over
and
my
instructions
duly
noted
i
began
to
gather
together
the
various
sheets
which
were
all
numbered
but
to
my
surprise
herr
gerhardt
looking
over
me
withdrew
two
of
the
most
important
diagrams
without
which
the
others
were
valueless
because
inexplicable
stay
he
said
these
two
ludwig
must
be
kept
separate
these
we
send
by
registered
post
direct
to
bluestone
and
fagg
they
will
receive
them
a
day
before
they
see
you
and
with
them
a
letter
announcing
your
arrival
i
looked
up
in
some
disappointment
i
had
known
of
precautions
of
the
kind
being
taken
but
usually
when
the
employé
sent
was
less
reliable
than
i
believed
myself
to
be
still
i
scarcely
dared
to
demur
do
you
think
that
necessary
i
said
respectfully
i
can
assure
you
that
from
the
moment
you
entrust
me
with
the
papers
they
shall
never
quit
me
day
or
night
and
if
there
were
any
postal
delay
you
say
time
is
valuable
in
this
case
or
if
the
papers
were
stolen
in
the
transit
such
things
have
happened
my
whole
mission
would
be
worthless
we
do
not
doubt
your
zeal
and
discretion
my
good
schmidt
said
herr
gerhardt
but
in
this
case
we
must
take
even
extra
precautions
i
had
not
meant
to
tell
you
fearing
to
add
to
the
certain
amount
of
nervousness
and
strain
unavoidable
in
such
a
case
but
still
perhaps
it
is
best
that
you
should
know
that
we
reason
for
some
special
anxiety
it
has
been
hinted
to
us
that
some
breath
of
this
and
he
tapped
the
papers
has
reached
those
who
are
always
on
the
watch
for
such
things
we
can
not
be
too
careful
and
yet
i
persisted
you
would
trust
the
post
we
do
not
trust
the
post
he
replied
even
if
these
diagrams
were
tampered
with
they
would
be
perfectly
useless
and
tampered
with
they
will
not
be
but
even
supposing
anything
so
wild
the
rogues
in
question
knowing
of
your
departure
and
they
are
likely
to
know
of
it
than
of
our
packet
by
post
were
they
in
collusion
with
some
traitor
in
the
are
sharp
enough
to
guess
the
truth
that
we
have
made
a
masonic
secret
of
it
the
two
separate
diagrams
are
valueless
without
your
papers
papers
reveal
nothing
without
nos
and
i
bowed
in
submission
but
i
was
all
the
same
disappointed
as
i
said
and
a
trifle
mortified
herr
wilhelm
saw
it
and
cheered
me
up
all
right
lutz
my
boy
he
said
i
feel
just
like
you
nothing
i
should
enjoy
more
than
a
rush
over
to
london
carrying
the
whole
documents
and
prepared
for
a
fight
with
any
one
who
tried
to
get
hold
of
them
but
herr
gerhardt
here
is
than
we
are
the
elder
man
smiled
i
do
doubt
your
readiness
to
fight
nor
ludwig
either
but
it
would
be
by
no
such
honestly
brutal
means
as
open
robbery
that
we
should
be
outwitted
make
friends
readily
with
no
one
while
travelling
lutz
yet
avoid
the
appearance
of
keeping
yourself
aloof
you
understand
perfectly
i
said
i
shall
sleep
well
so
as
to
be
prepared
to
keep
awake
throughout
the
journey
the
papers
were
then
carefully
packed
up
those
consigned
to
my
care
were
to
be
carried
in
a
certain
light
black
handbag
with
a
very
good
lock
which
had
often
before
been
my
travelling
companion
and
the
following
evening
i
started
by
the
express
train
agreed
upon
so
at
least
i
have
always
believed
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
bring
forward
a
witness
to
the
fact
of
my
train
at
the
start
being
the
right
one
as
no
one
came
with
me
to
see
me
off
for
it
was
thought
best
that
i
should
depart
in
as
unobtrusive
a
manner
as
possible
as
even
in
a
large
town
such
as
ours
the
members
and
employés
of
an
old
and
important
house
like
the
moritzes
were
well
known
i
took
my
ticket
then
registering
no
luggage
as
i
had
none
but
what
i
easily
carried
in
my
hand
as
well
as
bag
it
was
already
dusk
if
not
dark
and
there
was
not
much
bustle
in
the
station
nor
apparently
many
passengers
i
took
my
place
in
an
empty
compartment
and
sat
there
quietly
till
the
train
should
start
a
few
minutes
before
it
did
so
another
man
got
in
i
was
somewhat
annoyed
at
this
as
in
my
circumstances
nothing
was
more
undesirable
than
travelling
alone
with
one
other
had
there
been
a
crowded
compartment
or
one
with
three
or
four
passengers
i
would
have
chosen
it
but
at
the
moment
i
got
in
the
carriages
were
all
either
empty
or
with
but
one
or
two
occupants
now
i
said
to
myself
i
should
have
done
better
to
wait
till
nearer
the
time
of
departure
and
then
chosen
my
place
i
turned
to
reconnoitre
my
companion
but
i
could
not
see
his
face
clearly
as
he
was
half
leaning
out
of
the
window
was
he
doing
so
on
purpose
i
said
to
myself
for
naturally
i
was
in
a
suspicious
mood
and
as
the
thought
struck
me
i
half
started
up
determined
to
choose
another
compartment
suddenly
a
peculiar
sound
made
itself
heard
my
companion
was
coughing
he
drew
his
head
in
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
as
he
coughed
again
you
never
heard
such
a
curious
cough
it
was
more
like
a
hen
clucking
than
anything
i
can
think
of
once
twice
he
coughed
then
as
if
he
had
been
waiting
for
the
slight
spasm
to
pass
he
sprang
up
looked
eagerly
out
of
the
window
again
and
opening
the
door
jumped
out
with
some
exclamation
as
if
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
a
friend
and
in
another
moment
or
two
he
could
barely
have
had
time
to
get
in
elsewhere
much
to
my
satisfaction
the
train
moved
off
now
thought
i
i
can
make
myself
comfortable
for
some
hours
we
do
not
stop
till
m
it
will
be
nine
by
then
if
no
one
gets
in
there
i
am
safe
to
go
through
till
alone
then
there
will
only
be
junction
and
a
clear
run
to
calais
i
unstrapped
my
rug
and
lit
a
cigar
of
course
i
had
chosen
a
and
delighted
at
having
got
rid
of
my
clucking
companion
the
time
passed
pleasantly
till
we
pulled
up
at
m
the
delay
there
was
not
great
and
to
my
enormous
satisfaction
no
one
molested
my
solitude
evidently
the
express
to
calais
was
not
in
very
great
demand
that
night
i
now
felt
so
secure
that
notwithstanding
my
intention
of
keeping
awake
all
night
my
innermost
consciousness
had
not
i
suppose
quite
resigned
itself
to
the
necessity
for
not
more
than
a
hour
or
so
after
leaving
m
possibly
sooner
i
fell
fast
asleep
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
slept
heavily
for
when
i
awoke
i
had
great
difficulty
in
remembering
where
i
was
only
by
slow
degrees
did
i
realise
that
i
was
not
in
my
comfortable
bed
at
home
but
in
a
chilly
chilly
yes
that
it
was
very
chilly
but
as
my
faculties
returned
i
remembered
my
precious
bag
and
forgot
all
else
in
a
momentary
terror
that
it
had
been
taken
from
me
no
there
it
was
my
elbow
had
been
pressed
against
it
as
i
slept
but
how
was
this
the
train
was
not
in
motion
we
were
standing
in
a
station
a
dingy
place
with
no
cheerful
noise
or
bustle
only
one
or
two
porters
slowly
moving
about
with
a
sort
of
sleepy
night
duty
surly
air
it
could
not
be
the
junction
i
looked
at
my
watch
barely
midnight
of
course
not
the
junction
we
were
not
due
there
till
four
in
the
morning
or
so
what
then
were
we
doing
here
and
what
here
had
there
been
an
accident
some
unforeseen
necessity
for
stopping
at
that
moment
a
curious
sound
from
some
yards
distance
only
it
seemed
to
come
caught
my
ear
it
was
that
croaking
cackling
cough
the
cough
of
my
momentary
towards
whom
i
had
felt
an
instinctive
aversion
i
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
just
opposite
dimly
lighted
like
everything
else
and
in
the
doorway
as
if
just
entering
was
a
figure
which
i
felt
pretty
sure
was
that
of
the
man
with
the
cough
bah
i
said
to
myself
i
must
not
be
fanciful
i
daresay
the
all
right
he
is
evidently
in
the
same
hole
as
myself
what
in
name
are
we
waiting
here
for
i
sprang
out
of
the
carriage
nearly
tumbling
over
a
porter
slowly
passing
along
how
long
are
we
to
stay
here
i
cried
when
do
we
start
again
for
and
i
named
the
junction
for
he
repeated
in
the
queerest
german
i
ever
heard
was
it
german
or
did
i
discover
his
meaning
by
some
preternatural
cleverness
of
my
own
there
is
no
train
for
for
four
or
five
hours
not
till
and
he
named
the
time
and
leaning
forward
lazily
he
took
out
my
larger
bag
and
my
rug
depositing
them
on
the
platform
he
did
not
seem
the
least
surprised
at
finding
me
there
i
might
have
been
there
for
a
week
it
seemed
to
me
no
train
for
five
hours
are
you
mad
i
said
he
shook
his
head
and
mumbled
something
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
pointed
to
the
opposite
gathering
my
things
together
i
hurried
thither
hoping
to
find
some
more
reliable
authority
but
there
was
no
one
there
except
a
fat
man
with
a
white
apron
who
was
clearing
the
counter
and
yes
in
one
corner
was
the
figure
i
had
mentally
dubbed
the
man
with
the
cough
i
addressed
the
cook
or
waiter
whichever
he
was
but
he
only
shook
his
head
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
trains
but
informed
me
that
in
other
words
i
must
turn
out
he
was
going
to
shut
up
and
where
am
i
to
spend
the
night
then
i
said
angrily
though
clearly
it
was
not
the
aproned
individual
who
was
responsible
for
the
position
in
which
i
found
myself
there
was
a
restauration
he
informed
me
near
at
hand
which
i
should
find
still
open
straight
before
me
on
leaving
the
station
and
then
a
few
doors
to
the
right
i
would
see
the
lights
clearly
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
i
went
out
and
as
i
did
so
the
silent
figure
in
the
corner
rose
also
and
followed
me
the
station
was
evidently
going
to
bed
as
i
passed
the
porter
i
repeated
the
hour
he
had
named
adding
that
is
the
first
train
for
junction
he
nodded
again
naming
the
exact
time
but
i
can
not
do
so
as
i
have
never
been
able
to
recollect
it
i
trudged
along
the
road
there
were
lamps
though
very
feeble
ones
but
by
their
light
i
saw
that
the
man
who
had
been
in
the
was
still
a
few
steps
behind
me
it
made
me
feel
slightly
nervous
and
i
looked
round
furtively
once
or
twice
the
last
time
i
did
so
he
was
not
to
be
seen
and
i
hoped
he
had
gone
some
other
way
the
restauration
was
scarcely
more
inviting
than
the
station
it
too
was
very
dimly
lighted
and
the
one
or
two
attendants
seemed
half
asleep
and
were
strangely
silent
there
was
a
fire
of
a
kind
and
i
seated
myself
at
a
small
table
near
it
and
asked
for
some
coffee
which
would
i
thought
serve
the
double
purpose
of
warming
me
and
keeping
me
awake
it
was
brought
me
in
silence
i
drank
it
and
felt
the
better
for
it
but
there
was
something
so
gloomy
and
unsociable
so
queer
and
almost
weird
about
the
whole
aspect
and
feeling
of
the
place
that
a
sort
of
irritable
resignation
took
possession
of
me
if
these
surly
folk
speak
neither
will
i
i
said
to
myself
childishly
and
incredible
as
it
may
sound
i
did
speak
i
think
i
paid
for
the
coffee
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
know
i
never
asked
what
i
had
meant
to
ask
the
name
of
the
town
a
place
of
some
importance
to
judge
by
the
size
of
the
station
and
the
extent
of
twinkling
lights
i
had
observed
as
i
made
my
way
to
the
restauration
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
never
been
able
to
identify
it
and
i
am
quite
sure
i
never
shall
what
was
there
peculiar
about
that
coffee
or
was
it
something
peculiar
about
my
own
condition
that
caused
it
to
have
the
unusual
effect
i
now
experienced
that
question
too
i
can
not
answer
all
i
remember
is
feeling
a
sensation
of
irresistible
drowsiness
creeping
over
me
mental
or
moral
i
may
say
as
well
as
physical
for
when
one
part
of
me
feebly
resisted
the
first
onslaught
of
sleep
something
seemed
to
reply
oh
nonsense
you
have
several
hours
before
you
your
papers
are
all
right
no
one
can
touch
them
without
awaking
you
and
dreamily
conscious
that
my
belongings
were
on
the
floor
at
my
feet
bag
itself
actually
resting
against
my
ankle
my
scruples
silenced
themselves
in
an
extraordinary
way
i
remember
nothing
more
save
a
vague
consciousness
through
all
my
slumber
of
confused
and
chaotic
dreams
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
recall
i
awoke
at
last
and
that
with
a
start
almost
a
jerk
something
had
awakened
me
a
sound
and
as
it
was
repeated
to
my
now
aroused
ears
i
knew
that
i
had
heard
it
before
off
and
on
during
my
sleep
it
was
the
extraordinary
cough
i
looked
up
yes
there
he
was
at
some
two
or
three
yards
distance
only
at
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
which
and
this
i
have
forgotten
to
mention
as
another
peculiar
item
in
that
night
peculiar
experiences
considering
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
i
was
still
in
germany
was
not
a
stove
but
an
open
grate
and
he
had
not
been
there
when
i
first
fell
asleep
to
that
i
was
prepared
to
swear
he
must
have
come
sneaking
in
after
me
i
thought
and
in
all
probability
i
should
neither
have
noticed
nor
recognised
him
but
for
that
traitorous
cackle
of
his
now
my
misgivings
aroused
my
first
thought
of
course
was
for
my
precious
charge
i
stooped
there
were
my
rugs
my
larger
bag
but
no
not
the
smaller
one
and
though
the
other
two
were
there
i
knew
at
once
that
they
were
not
quite
in
the
same
position
not
so
close
to
me
horror
seized
me
half
wildly
i
gazed
around
when
my
silent
neighbour
bent
towards
me
i
could
declare
there
was
nothing
in
his
hand
when
he
did
so
and
i
could
declare
as
positively
that
i
had
already
looked
under
the
small
round
table
beside
which
i
sat
and
that
the
bag
was
not
there
and
yet
when
the
man
with
a
slight
cackle
caused
no
doubt
by
his
stooping
raised
himself
the
thing
was
in
his
hand
was
he
a
conjurer
a
pupil
of
maskelyne
and
cook
and
how
was
it
that
even
as
he
held
out
my
missing
property
he
managed
and
that
most
cleverly
and
unobtrusively
to
prevent
my
catching
sight
of
his
face
i
did
not
see
it
then
i
never
did
see
it
something
he
murmured
to
the
effect
that
he
supposed
the
bag
was
what
i
was
looking
for
in
what
language
he
spoke
i
know
not
it
was
more
that
by
the
action
accompanying
the
mumbled
sounds
i
gathered
his
meaning
than
that
i
heard
anything
articulate
i
thanked
him
of
course
mechanically
so
to
say
though
i
began
to
feel
as
if
he
were
an
evil
spirit
haunting
me
i
could
only
hope
that
the
splendid
lock
to
the
bag
had
defied
all
curiosity
but
i
felt
in
a
fever
to
be
alone
again
and
able
to
satisfy
myself
that
nothing
had
been
tampered
with
the
thought
recalled
my
wandering
faculties
how
long
had
i
been
asleep
i
drew
out
my
watch
heavens
it
was
close
upon
the
hour
named
for
the
first
train
in
the
morning
i
sprang
up
collected
my
things
and
dashed
out
of
the
restauration
if
i
had
not
paid
for
my
coffee
before
i
certainly
did
not
pay
for
it
then
besides
my
haste
there
was
another
reason
for
this
there
was
no
one
to
pay
to
not
a
creature
was
to
be
seen
in
the
room
or
at
the
door
as
i
passed
out
always
excepting
the
man
with
the
cough
as
i
left
the
place
and
hurried
along
the
road
a
bell
began
not
to
ring
but
to
toll
it
sounded
most
uncanny
what
it
meant
of
course
i
have
never
known
it
may
have
been
a
summons
to
the
workpeople
of
some
manufactory
it
may
have
been
like
all
the
other
experiences
of
that
strange
night
but
no
this
theory
i
will
not
at
present
enter
upon
dawn
was
not
yet
breaking
but
there
was
in
one
direction
a
faint
suggestion
of
something
of
the
kind
not
far
off
otherwise
all
was
dark
i
stumbled
along
as
best
as
i
could
helped
in
reality
i
suppose
by
the
ugly
yellow
glimmer
of
the
woebegone
street
or
road
lamps
and
it
was
not
far
to
the
station
though
somehow
it
seemed
farther
than
when
i
came
and
somehow
too
it
seemed
to
have
grown
steep
though
i
could
not
remember
having
noticed
any
slope
the
other
way
on
my
arrival
a
sensation
began
to
oppress
me
i
felt
as
if
my
luggage
was
growing
momentarily
heavier
and
heavier
as
if
i
should
reach
the
station
and
to
this
was
joined
the
agonising
terror
of
missing
the
train
i
made
a
desperate
effort
cold
as
it
was
the
beads
of
perspiration
stood
out
upon
my
forehead
as
i
forced
myself
along
and
by
degrees
the
nightmare
feeling
cleared
off
i
found
myself
entering
the
station
at
a
run
just
as
yes
a
train
was
actually
beginning
to
move
i
dashed
baggage
and
all
into
a
compartment
it
was
empty
and
it
was
a
one
precisely
similar
to
the
one
i
had
occupied
before
it
might
have
been
the
very
same
one
the
train
gradually
increased
its
speed
but
for
the
first
few
moments
while
still
in
the
station
and
passing
through
its
immediate
another
strange
thing
struck
me
the
extraordinary
silence
and
lifelessness
of
all
about
not
one
human
being
did
i
see
no
porter
watching
our
departure
with
the
faithful
though
stolid
interest
always
to
be
seen
on
the
visage
i
might
have
been
alone
in
the
train
it
might
have
had
a
freight
of
the
dead
and
been
itself
propelled
by
some
supernatural
agency
so
noiselessly
so
gloomily
did
it
proceed
you
will
scarcely
credit
that
i
actually
and
for
the
third
time
fell
asleep
i
could
not
help
it
some
occult
influence
was
at
work
upon
me
throughout
those
dark
hours
i
am
positively
certain
and
with
the
daylight
it
was
dispelled
for
when
i
again
awoke
i
felt
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
home
completely
and
normally
myself
fresh
and
vigorous
all
my
faculties
at
their
best
but
nevertheless
my
first
sensation
was
a
start
of
amazement
almost
of
terror
the
compartment
was
nearly
full
there
were
at
least
five
or
six
travellers
besides
myself
very
respectable
folk
with
nothing
in
the
least
alarming
about
them
yet
it
was
with
a
gasp
of
extraordinary
relief
that
i
found
my
precious
bag
in
the
corner
beside
me
where
i
had
carefully
placed
it
it
was
concealed
from
view
no
one
i
felt
assured
could
have
touched
it
without
awaking
me
it
was
broad
and
bright
daylight
how
long
had
i
slept
can
you
tell
me
i
inquired
of
my
opposite
neighbour
a
compatriot
can
you
tell
me
how
soon
we
get
to
junction
by
this
train
i
am
most
anxious
to
catch
the
evening
mail
at
calais
and
am
quite
out
in
my
reckonings
owing
to
an
extraordinary
delay
at
i
have
wasted
the
night
by
getting
into
a
stopping
train
instead
of
the
express
he
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
he
must
have
thought
me
either
mad
or
just
awaking
from
a
fit
of
intoxication
only
i
flatter
myself
i
did
not
look
as
if
the
latter
were
the
case
how
soon
we
get
to
junction
he
repeated
why
my
good
sir
you
left
it
about
three
hours
ago
it
is
now
eight
we
all
got
in
at
the
junction
you
were
alone
if
i
mistake
not
he
glanced
at
one
or
two
of
the
others
who
endorsed
his
statement
and
very
fast
asleep
you
were
and
must
have
been
not
to
be
disturbed
by
the
bustle
at
the
station
and
as
for
catching
the
evening
boat
at
calais
he
burst
into
a
loud
guffaw
why
it
would
be
very
hard
lines
to
do
no
better
than
that
all
hope
to
cross
by
the
one
then
what
train
this
i
exclaimed
utterly
perplexed
the
express
of
course
all
of
us
excepting
yourself
joined
it
at
the
junction
he
replied
the
express
i
repeated
the
express
that
leaves
and
i
named
my
own
town
at
six
in
the
evening
exactly
you
have
got
into
the
right
train
after
all
and
here
came
another
shout
of
amusement
how
did
you
think
we
had
all
got
in
if
you
had
not
yet
passed
the
junction
you
had
not
the
pleasure
of
our
company
from
m
i
take
it
m
which
you
passed
at
nine
last
night
if
my
memory
is
correct
then
i
persisted
this
is
the
express
which
does
not
stop
between
m
and
your
junction
exactly
he
repeated
and
then
confirmed
most
probably
in
his
belief
that
i
was
mad
or
the
other
thing
he
turned
to
his
newspaper
and
left
me
to
my
extraordinary
cogitations
had
i
been
dreaming
impossible
every
sensation
the
very
taste
of
the
coffee
seemed
still
present
with
me
the
curious
accent
of
the
officials
at
the
mysterious
town
i
could
perfectly
recall
i
still
shivered
at
the
remembrance
of
the
chilly
waking
in
the
restauration
i
heard
again
the
cackling
cough
but
i
felt
i
must
collect
myself
and
be
ready
for
the
important
negotiation
entrusted
to
me
and
to
do
this
i
must
for
the
time
banish
these
fruitless
efforts
at
solving
the
problem
we
had
a
good
run
to
calais
found
the
boat
in
waiting
and
a
fair
passage
brought
us
prosperously
across
the
channel
i
found
myself
in
london
punctual
to
the
intended
hour
of
my
arrival
at
once
i
drove
to
the
lodgings
in
a
small
street
off
the
strand
which
i
was
accustomed
to
frequent
in
such
circumstances
i
felt
nervous
till
i
had
an
opportunity
of
thoroughly
overhauling
my
documents
the
bag
had
been
opened
by
the
custom
house
officials
but
the
words
private
papers
had
sufficed
to
prevent
any
further
examination
and
to
my
unspeakable
delight
they
were
intact
a
glance
satisfied
me
as
to
this
the
moment
i
got
them
out
for
they
were
most
carefully
numbered
the
next
morning
saw
me
early
on
my
way
to
no
we
will
say
blackfriars
street
where
was
the
office
of
bluestone
fagg
i
had
never
been
there
before
but
it
was
easy
to
find
and
had
i
felt
any
doubt
their
name
stared
me
in
the
face
at
the
side
of
the
open
doorway
i
thought
i
read
but
when
i
reached
the
first
landing
i
imagined
i
must
have
been
mistaken
for
there
at
a
door
ajar
stood
an
eminently
gentleman
who
bowed
as
he
saw
me
with
a
discreet
smile
herr
schmidt
he
said
ah
yes
i
was
on
the
for
you
i
felt
a
little
surprised
and
my
glance
involuntarily
strayed
to
the
doorway
there
was
no
name
upon
it
and
it
appeared
to
have
been
freshly
painted
my
new
friend
saw
my
glance
it
is
all
right
he
said
we
have
the
painters
here
we
are
using
these
lower
rooms
temporarily
i
was
watching
to
prevent
your
having
the
trouble
of
mounting
to
the
and
as
i
followed
him
in
i
caught
sight
of
a
painter
ladder
a
small
one
on
the
stair
above
and
the
smell
was
also
unmistakable
the
large
outer
office
looked
bare
and
empty
but
under
the
circumstances
that
was
natural
no
one
was
at
the
first
glance
to
be
seen
but
behind
a
dulled
glass
partition
screening
off
one
corner
i
fancied
i
caught
sight
of
a
seated
figure
and
an
inner
office
to
which
my
conductor
led
the
way
had
a
more
comfortable
and
inhabited
look
here
stood
a
younger
man
he
bowed
politely
fagg
my
junior
said
the
first
individual
airily
and
now
herr
schmidt
to
business
at
once
if
you
please
time
is
everything
you
have
all
the
documents
ready
i
answered
by
opening
my
bag
and
spreading
out
its
contents
both
men
were
very
grave
almost
taciturn
but
as
i
proceeded
to
explain
things
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
thoroughly
understood
all
i
said
and
now
i
went
on
when
i
had
reached
a
certain
point
if
you
will
give
me
nos
and
which
you
have
already
received
by
registered
post
i
can
put
you
in
full
possession
of
the
whole
without
them
of
course
all
i
have
said
is
so
to
say
preliminary
only
the
two
looked
at
each
other
of
course
said
the
elder
man
i
follow
what
you
say
the
key
of
the
whole
is
wanting
but
i
was
momentarily
expecting
you
to
bring
it
out
we
have
not
fagg
i
am
right
am
i
not
we
have
received
nothing
by
post
nothing
whatever
replied
his
junior
and
the
answer
seemed
simplicity
itself
why
did
a
strange
thrill
of
misgiving
go
through
me
was
it
something
in
the
look
that
had
passed
between
them
perhaps
so
in
any
case
strange
to
say
the
inconsistency
between
their
having
received
no
papers
and
yet
looking
for
my
arrival
at
the
hour
mentioned
in
the
letter
accompanying
the
documents
and
accosting
me
by
name
did
not
strike
me
till
some
hours
later
i
threw
off
what
i
believed
to
be
my
ridiculous
mistrust
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
do
so
in
my
extreme
annoyance
i
can
not
understand
it
i
said
it
is
really
too
bad
everything
depends
upon
and
i
must
telegraph
at
once
for
inquiries
to
be
instituted
at
the
but
your
people
must
have
duplicates
said
fagg
eagerly
these
can
be
forwarded
at
once
i
hope
so
i
said
though
feeling
strangely
confused
and
worried
they
must
send
them
direct
he
went
on
i
did
not
at
once
answer
i
was
gathering
my
papers
together
and
in
the
meantime
he
proceeded
touching
my
bag
you
had
better
leave
here
we
will
lock
them
up
in
the
safe
at
once
it
is
better
than
carrying
them
about
london
it
certainly
seemed
so
i
half
laid
down
the
bag
on
the
table
but
at
that
moment
from
the
outer
room
a
most
peculiar
sound
caught
my
ears
a
faint
cackling
cough
i
i
concealed
my
start
i
turned
away
as
if
considering
fagg
suggestion
which
to
confess
the
truth
i
had
been
on
the
very
point
of
agreeing
to
for
it
would
have
been
a
great
relief
to
me
to
know
that
the
papers
were
in
safe
custody
but
now
a
flash
of
lurid
light
seemed
to
have
transformed
everything
i
thank
you
i
replied
i
should
be
glad
to
be
free
from
the
responsibility
of
the
charge
but
i
dare
not
let
these
out
of
my
own
hands
till
the
agreement
is
formally
signed
the
younger
man
face
darkened
he
assumed
a
bullying
tone
i
do
know
how
it
strikes
bluestone
he
said
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
young
gentleman
is
going
rather
too
far
do
you
think
your
employers
will
be
pleased
to
hear
of
your
insulting
us
sir
but
the
elder
man
smiled
condescendingly
though
with
a
touch
of
superciliousness
it
was
very
well
done
he
waved
his
hand
stay
my
dear
fagg
we
can
well
afford
to
make
allowance
you
will
telegraph
at
once
no
doubt
herr
schmidt
and
let
me
see
yes
we
shall
receive
the
duplicates
of
nos
and
by
first
post
on
thursday
morning
i
bowed
exactly
i
replied
as
i
lifted
the
now
locked
bag
and
you
may
expect
me
at
the
same
hour
on
thursday
morning
then
i
took
my
departure
accompanied
to
the
door
by
the
urbane
individual
who
had
received
me
the
telegram
which
i
at
once
despatched
was
not
couched
precisely
as
he
would
have
dictated
i
allow
and
he
would
have
been
considerably
surprised
at
my
sending
off
another
later
in
the
day
to
bluestone
fagg
telegraphic
address
in
these
words
unavoidably
detained
till
thursday
schmidt
this
was
the
arrival
of
a
wire
from
home
in
answer
to
mine
by
thursday
morning
i
had
had
time
to
receive
a
letter
from
herr
wilhelm
and
to
secure
the
services
of
a
certain
noted
detective
accompanied
by
whom
i
presented
myself
at
the
appointed
hour
at
but
my
companion
services
were
not
required
the
birds
had
flown
warned
by
the
same
traitor
in
our
camp
through
whom
the
first
hints
of
the
new
patent
had
leaked
out
with
him
it
was
easy
to
deal
poor
wretch
but
the
clever
rogues
who
had
employed
him
and
personated
the
members
of
the
honourable
firm
of
bluestone
fagg
were
never
traced
the
negotiation
was
successfully
carried
out
the
experience
i
had
gone
through
left
me
a
wiser
man
it
is
to
be
hoped
too
that
the
owners
of
blackfriars
street
were
more
cautious
in
the
future
as
to
whom
they
let
their
premises
to
when
temporarily
vacant
the
of
the
doorway
at
the
tenant
own
expense
had
already
roused
some
slight
suspicion
it
is
needless
to
add
that
nos
and
had
been
duly
received
on
the
i
have
never
known
the
true
history
of
that
extraordinary
night
was
it
all
a
dream
or
a
prophetic
vision
of
warning
or
was
it
in
any
sense
true
i
in
some
inexplicable
way
left
my
own
town
earlier
than
i
intended
and
really
travelled
in
a
slow
train
or
had
the
man
with
a
cough
for
his
own
nefarious
purposes
mesmerised
or
hypnotised
me
and
to
some
extent
succeeded
i
can
not
say
sometimes
even
i
ask
myself
if
i
am
quite
sure
that
there
ever
was
such
a
person
as
the
man
with
the
cough
between
the
stiles
a
incident
by
the
road
scarby
village
is
good
three
miles
from
colletwood
the
nearest
town
and
railway
station
but
there
is
a
short
cut
over
the
hills
for
foot
passengers
the
hills
they
call
it
but
the
hills
would
be
more
correct
for
there
is
a
sort
of
tableland
once
you
have
climbed
a
short
steep
bit
up
from
the
town
which
extends
nearly
to
scarby
sloping
gradually
down
to
the
village
and
on
each
side
of
this
tableland
the
hills
rise
again
north
and
south
much
higher
to
the
north
than
to
the
south
so
this
flat
stretch
though
at
some
considerable
height
is
neither
bleak
nor
exposed
being
sheltered
on
the
colder
side
and
fairly
open
to
the
sunshine
south
and
west
it
is
a
pleasant
place
and
so
it
must
have
been
considered
in
the
old
days
for
a
large
monastery
stood
there
once
of
which
the
ruins
are
still
to
be
seen
and
of
which
the
memory
is
still
preserved
in
the
name
monksholdings
pleasant
but
a
trifle
inconvenient
as
the
only
makes
a
great
round
from
colletwood
winding
along
the
base
of
the
hill
on
the
north
side
till
it
reaches
the
village
then
up
again
by
the
gradual
slope
half
a
mile
or
so
a
drive
in
all
of
three
to
four
miles
whereas
as
the
bird
flies
or
the
pedestrian
walks
the
distance
from
the
town
is
barely
a
quarter
of
that
in
the
old
days
there
was
probably
no
road
at
all
the
doubtless
serving
all
requirements
naturally
enough
therefore
it
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
entirely
public
property
and
people
forgot
if
indeed
any
one
had
ever
thought
of
it
that
though
the
monastery
was
a
ruin
the
once
carefully
kept
land
round
about
the
old
of
monksholdings
was
still
private
property
and
the
sensation
was
great
when
suddenly
the
news
reached
the
neighbourhood
that
this
unique
estate
as
the
agents
called
it
was
sold
sold
by
the
old
duke
of
scarshire
who
scarcely
remembered
that
he
owned
it
to
a
man
who
meant
to
live
on
it
to
build
a
house
which
should
be
a
home
for
several
months
of
the
year
for
himself
and
his
family
there
was
considerable
growling
and
grumbling
and
this
rose
to
its
height
when
a
rumour
got
about
that
the
such
part
of
it
that
is
to
say
as
lay
within
the
actual
demesne
was
to
be
closed
be
closed
if
the
site
already
chosen
for
the
new
house
was
to
be
retained
for
the
house
would
actually
stand
upon
the
old
and
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
that
this
position
had
been
well
and
wisely
selected
things
grew
warlike
boding
no
agreeable
reception
for
the
newcomers
a
raynald
and
his
family
newcomers
to
england
it
was
said
as
well
as
to
scarshire
every
one
plunged
into
questions
of
the
local
legalities
raised
and
discussed
knotty
points
colletwood
and
scarby
were
aflame
but
it
all
ended
flatly
enough
in
a
compromise
raynald
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
reasonable
and
courteous
of
men
he
came
saw
and
conquered
the
goodwill
of
his
future
neighbours
was
won
he
knew
he
had
risked
its
loss
henceforward
congratulations
reciprocated
and
repeated
on
the
charming
additions
to
scarby
society
were
the
order
of
the
day
and
the
skirting
the
south
boundary
of
the
monksholdings
grounds
which
the
footpath
was
now
inveigled
into
making
was
voted
a
great
improvement
and
in
due
time
the
mansion
rose
a
great
improvement
also
to
the
aspect
of
the
surrounding
landscape
it
was
in
perfectly
good
taste
unpretentious
and
quietly
picturesque
it
might
have
been
there
always
for
any
jarring
protest
to
the
contrary
and
just
along
the
old
that
is
to
say
between
the
two
stiles
which
let
the
traveller
to
or
from
scarby
in
or
out
of
the
monksholdings
demesne
stood
sybil
raynald
grand
piano
the
stiles
remained
as
an
interesting
survival
but
they
were
made
use
of
by
no
one
not
bound
for
the
house
itself
and
beside
each
was
a
gate
a
good
oaken
gate
that
suited
the
place
as
did
everything
about
it
and
beside
each
gate
a
quaint
miniature
dwelling
one
of
which
came
to
be
known
as
the
east
and
the
other
as
the
west
monksholdings
lodge
the
first
time
the
raynalds
came
down
to
their
new
home
they
made
but
a
short
stay
there
it
was
already
late
in
the
season
and
though
the
preceding
summer
had
been
a
magnificent
one
for
drying
fresh
walls
and
plaster
it
would
scarcely
have
done
to
risk
damp
or
chilly
weather
in
so
a
house
they
stayed
long
enough
to
confirm
the
favourable
impression
the
head
of
the
family
had
already
made
and
to
lead
themselves
to
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
a
less
curtailed
stay
in
scarshire
the
last
morning
of
their
visit
sybil
the
eldest
daughter
up
and
about
betimes
turned
to
her
father
when
she
had
taken
her
place
beside
him
at
the
with
a
suspicion
of
annoyance
on
her
usually
cheerful
face
papa
she
said
i
have
seen
that
old
man
leaning
on
the
stile
by
the
scarby
lodge
and
looking
in
along
the
drive
queerly
i
do
quite
like
it
it
gave
me
rather
a
ghosty
feeling
or
else
he
is
out
of
his
mind
her
brother
mark
by
name
began
to
laugh
after
the
manner
of
brothers
how
very
oddly
you
express
yourself
he
said
i
should
like
to
experience
ghosty
feeling
a
ghost
is
just
what
this
place
wants
to
make
it
perfect
but
it
should
be
the
spirit
of
one
of
the
original
monks
raynald
turned
to
his
son
rather
sharply
i
do
want
any
nonsense
of
that
kind
set
about
mark
he
said
it
would
frighten
the
younger
children
when
they
come
down
here
i
will
ask
about
the
old
man
it
is
quite
possible
he
is
or
something
of
that
sort
i
forgot
about
it
when
sybil
mentioned
it
before
but
no
doubt
he
is
perfectly
harmless
has
no
one
seen
him
but
you
sybil
the
girl
shook
her
head
none
of
she
replied
and
i
was
exactly
frightened
there
was
something
very
pathetic
about
him
he
looked
at
me
closely
murmuring
some
words
and
then
shook
his
head
that
was
all
but
just
then
her
father
was
called
away
to
give
some
last
directions
and
in
the
bustle
of
hurry
to
catch
their
train
the
matter
passed
from
the
minds
of
the
younger
as
well
as
the
elder
members
of
the
family
it
returned
to
sybil
memory
however
when
she
found
herself
in
their
london
house
again
and
called
upon
by
her
younger
sisters
to
relate
every
detail
of
monksholdings
and
its
neighbourhood
but
mindful
of
her
father
warning
she
said
nothing
to
esther
or
annis
of
the
figure
at
the
gate
it
was
only
to
miss
march
ellinor
march
the
governess
who
was
more
friend
than
teacher
to
her
three
pupils
that
she
spoke
of
it
late
in
the
evening
when
the
younger
ones
had
gone
to
bed
and
her
father
and
mother
were
busy
with
indian
letters
in
raynald
study
the
two
girls
we
may
say
for
ellinor
was
still
some
years
under
thirty
were
alone
in
the
ellinor
had
been
playing
something
tender
and
faintly
weird
it
died
away
under
her
fingers
and
she
sat
on
at
the
piano
in
silence
sybil
spoke
suddenly
that
is
melancholy
she
said
something
so
long
ago
about
it
like
the
ghost
of
a
sorrow
rather
than
a
sorrow
itself
i
know
i
know
what
it
makes
me
think
of
listen
ellinor
for
out
of
school
hours
the
two
threw
formality
aside
and
sybil
told
of
the
sad
wistful
old
face
looking
over
the
stile
now
it
has
come
back
to
me
she
said
i
ca
forget
it
ellinor
too
was
impressed
yes
she
said
it
sounds
very
pitiful
who
knows
what
tragedy
is
bound
up
in
it
and
she
sighed
sybil
understood
her
miss
march
own
history
was
a
strange
one
we
must
find
out
about
it
when
we
go
down
to
monksholdings
next
year
she
said
and
perhaps
added
ellinor
even
if
he
is
we
might
do
something
to
comfort
the
poor
man
sybil
hesitated
then
you
do
think
he
can
be
a
ghost
she
said
looking
half
ashamed
of
the
suggestion
miss
march
smiled
her
smile
was
sad
in
one
sense
no
i
should
think
it
highly
improbable
in
another
yes
there
must
be
the
ghost
of
some
great
sorrow
about
the
face
you
describe
she
said
so
there
was
this
is
the
story
at
the
farther
end
of
scarby
village
the
farther
end
that
is
to
say
from
monksholdings
and
the
path
between
the
hills
the
road
drops
again
somewhat
suddenly
only
for
a
short
distance
however
mayling
farm
giles
as
it
is
colloquially
called
which
is
the
first
house
you
come
to
when
you
reach
level
ground
again
being
by
no
means
low
lying
on
the
contrary
the
west
windows
command
a
grand
view
of
the
great
scarshire
plain
beneath
bordered
by
the
faint
hazy
blue
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
clouds
of
the
long
range
of
hills
concealing
the
glimmer
of
the
ocean
which
otherwise
might
sometimes
be
perceptible
mayling
is
a
very
old
place
and
the
giles
had
been
there
always
so
to
speak
unambitious
save
as
regards
their
farming
and
its
success
they
had
been
just
the
make
of
men
to
settle
on
to
their
ground
as
if
it
and
they
could
have
no
existence
apart
a
fine
race
physically
as
well
as
morally
though
some
years
or
so
before
the
raynalds
bought
monksholdings
a
run
of
ill
luck
a
whole
chapter
of
casualties
had
brought
them
down
to
but
one
representative
and
he
scarcely
the
typical
farmer
giles
of
mayling
this
was
barnett
the
youngest
of
four
stalwart
sons
the
youngest
and
the
only
survivor
he
was
already
forty
when
his
father
died
earnestly
commending
to
him
the
old
place
which
even
at
eighty
the
aged
farmer
felt
himself
better
fitted
to
manage
than
the
somewhat
delicate
sensitive
man
whom
his
brothers
had
made
fun
of
in
his
youth
as
a
but
barnett
was
intelligent
and
sensible
and
he
rose
to
the
occasion
circumstances
helped
him
the
year
after
old
giles
death
barnett
for
the
first
time
fell
in
love
wisely
and
well
his
affection
was
bestowed
on
a
worthy
object
marion
grover
the
daughter
of
a
yeoman
in
the
next
county
and
was
fully
returned
marion
was
years
younger
than
her
lover
fifteen
at
least
eminently
practical
healthy
and
pretty
she
brought
her
husband
just
exactly
what
he
was
most
in
need
of
brightness
energy
and
youth
it
was
an
ideal
marriage
and
everything
prospered
at
mayling
four
years
after
the
advent
of
the
new
giles
you
would
scarcely
have
recognised
the
farmer
he
seemed
another
man
he
adored
his
wife
and
could
hardly
find
it
in
his
heart
to
regret
that
their
child
was
not
a
son
even
though
failing
an
heir
the
old
name
must
die
out
for
if
there
was
one
creature
the
husband
and
wife
loved
more
than
each
other
it
was
their
baby
girl
a
month
or
two
after
this
child
second
birthday
the
singular
catastrophe
occurred
which
changed
the
world
to
poor
barnett
giles
leaving
him
but
a
wreck
of
his
former
self
physically
and
mentally
young
giles
was
strong
in
every
way
and
from
the
first
she
took
the
line
of
saving
her
husband
all
extra
fatigue
or
annoyance
which
she
could
possibly
hoist
on
to
her
own
brave
shoulders
there
was
something
quaint
and
even
pathetic
in
the
relations
of
the
couple
for
notwithstanding
marion
being
so
much
barnett
junior
her
attitude
towards
him
had
a
decided
suggestion
of
the
maternal
about
it
though
at
times
of
real
emergency
his
sound
judgment
and
advice
never
failed
her
it
was
within
a
week
or
two
of
christmas
the
weather
was
bitingly
raspingly
cold
and
though
as
yet
no
snow
had
fallen
the
were
predicting
it
daily
i
go
over
to
colletwood
this
week
said
giles
and
i
must
take
nelly
her
new
coat
is
waiting
to
be
tried
at
the
dressmaker
and
i
must
get
her
some
boots
and
several
other
things
before
christmas
and
there
is
a
whole
list
of
other
shopping
too
all
our
christmas
presents
to
see
to
her
husband
was
looking
out
of
the
window
it
was
still
very
early
in
the
day
i
doubt
if
the
snow
will
hold
off
much
longer
he
said
and
once
it
begins
it
may
be
heavy
his
wife
replied
and
then
i
might
not
be
able
to
go
for
ever
so
long
even
by
the
road
for
a
deep
fall
of
snow
at
scarby
was
practically
a
stoppage
to
all
traffic
tell
you
what
barnett
we
go
and
make
sure
of
it
i
will
put
other
things
aside
and
start
before
noon
a
couple
of
hours
or
three
at
the
most
will
do
everything
and
then
nelly
and
i
will
be
back
long
before
dark
you
come
to
meet
us
wo
you
of
course
i
will
if
you
go
but
and
again
he
glanced
at
the
sky
the
morning
was
so
far
clear
and
bright
though
very
cold
but
over
towards
the
north
there
was
a
suspicious
look
about
the
clouds
i
do
know
he
said
but
that
you
better
wait
till
and
see
if
it
blows
off
again
but
marion
shook
her
head
i
a
feeling
she
said
that
if
i
do
go
i
wo
go
at
all
and
i
really
must
i
take
betsy
to
carry
the
child
till
just
above
the
town
and
then
send
her
home
so
as
not
to
be
tired
for
coming
back
not
that
i
tired
as
you
know
with
a
smile
he
gave
in
only
stipulating
that
at
all
costs
they
should
start
to
return
by
a
certain
hour
unless
the
snow
should
have
already
begun
in
which
case
marion
was
to
run
no
risks
but
either
to
hire
a
fly
to
bring
her
home
by
the
road
or
to
stay
in
the
town
with
some
of
her
friends
till
the
weather
cleared
again
and
i
meet
you
he
added
let
us
set
our
watches
together
start
from
here
so
as
to
be
at
let
me
see
between
the
stiles
said
marion
we
can
each
see
the
other
from
one
stile
to
the
opposite
one
you
know
even
though
it
a
good
bit
of
a
way
yes
dear
i
time
it
as
near
as
i
can
to
meet
between
the
stiles
and
with
these
words
the
last
on
her
lips
she
set
off
a
picture
of
health
and
happiness
little
nelly
crowing
back
to
dada
from
over
stout
betsy
shoulder
betsy
was
home
again
within
the
hour
but
the
mother
and
child
alas
and
alas
it
was
the
immortal
story
of
lucy
gray
in
an
almost
more
pathetic
shape
farmer
giles
as
i
have
said
was
a
studious
often
man
there
was
not
much
to
do
at
that
season
and
in
such
weather
and
what
there
was
some
amount
of
supervision
on
his
part
was
enough
for
after
his
early
dinner
he
got
out
his
books
for
an
hour
or
two
quiet
reading
till
it
should
be
time
to
set
off
to
meet
his
darlings
no
fear
of
his
forgetting
time
but
till
the
clock
struck
and
he
saw
it
was
approaching
nearly
he
never
looked
out
he
was
unconscious
of
the
rapid
growth
of
the
lurid
steely
clouds
he
had
no
idea
that
the
snowflakes
were
already
falling
falling
more
and
more
closely
and
thickly
with
each
instant
that
passed
then
rose
the
storm
spirit
and
issued
his
orders
all
too
quickly
obeyed
before
barnett
giles
had
left
the
village
street
he
found
himself
in
what
would
be
called
a
blizzard
and
his
pale
face
grew
paler
and
his
heart
beat
as
if
to
choke
him
when
at
last
he
reached
the
first
stile
and
stood
there
panting
to
regain
his
breath
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
battle
on
through
the
fury
of
the
wind
the
blinding
whirling
snow
which
seemed
to
envelop
him
as
if
in
sheets
not
for
many
and
many
a
day
will
that
awful
snowstorm
be
forgotten
in
scarshire
it
was
at
the
appointed
trysting
place
they
found
him
between
the
stiles
but
not
till
late
that
evening
when
betsy
more
alarmed
by
his
absence
than
by
her
mistress
not
returning
at
last
struggled
out
through
the
snow
to
alarm
the
nearest
neighbours
the
missis
and
miss
nell
will
have
stayed
the
night
in
the
town
she
said
but
i
misdoubt
me
if
the
master
will
ever
have
got
so
far
though
he
may
have
been
tempted
on
when
he
did
not
meet
them
by
this
time
the
fury
of
the
storm
had
spent
itself
and
they
found
poor
giles
after
a
not
very
protracted
search
and
brought
him
home
dead
they
thought
at
first
no
he
was
not
dead
but
it
was
less
than
half
that
he
returned
to
for
his
first
inquiry
late
the
next
day
when
glimmering
consciousness
had
begun
to
revive
marion
the
baby
seemed
by
some
subtle
instinct
to
answer
itself
truthfully
in
spite
of
the
kindly
endeavour
to
deceive
him
for
the
time
dead
he
murmured
i
knew
it
between
the
stiles
and
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
they
almost
wished
he
had
died
too
the
rough
but
who
were
his
neighbours
but
he
lived
he
never
asked
and
never
knew
the
details
of
the
tragedy
which
indeed
was
never
fully
known
by
any
one
all
that
came
to
light
was
that
the
dead
body
of
marion
giles
was
brought
by
some
wanderers
to
the
workhouse
of
a
town
several
miles
south
of
colletwood
early
on
the
morning
after
the
blizzard
they
had
found
it
they
said
at
some
little
distance
from
the
road
along
which
they
were
journeying
so
that
she
must
have
lost
her
way
long
before
approaching
the
monksholdings
confines
not
improbably
indeed
in
attempting
to
retrace
her
steps
to
the
town
which
she
had
so
imprudently
quitted
but
of
the
child
the
tramps
said
nothing
and
after
making
the
above
deposition
they
were
allowed
to
go
on
their
way
which
they
expressed
themselves
as
anxious
to
do
for
reasons
of
their
own
no
doubt
possibly
the
same
reasons
which
had
prevented
their
returning
to
colletwood
with
the
young
woman
corpse
as
would
have
seemed
more
natural
and
afterwards
no
very
special
inquiry
was
made
about
the
baby
the
father
was
incapable
of
it
and
in
those
days
people
accepted
things
more
carelessly
perhaps
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
little
nell
had
fallen
down
some
cliff
no
doubt
and
lay
buried
there
with
the
snow
for
her
shroud
like
a
strayed
lambkin
her
tiny
bones
might
yet
be
found
years
hence
maybe
by
a
shepherd
in
search
of
some
bleating
wanderer
or
no
more
might
ever
be
known
of
the
infant
fate
barnett
giles
rose
from
his
bed
after
many
weeks
with
all
the
look
of
a
very
old
man
at
first
it
was
thought
that
his
mind
was
quite
gone
but
it
did
not
prove
to
be
so
after
a
time
with
the
help
of
an
excellent
foreman
or
bailiff
he
showed
himself
able
to
manage
his
farm
with
a
strange
mechanical
kind
of
intelligence
it
seemed
as
if
the
sense
of
duty
outlived
the
loss
of
other
perceptions
though
these
too
cleared
by
degrees
to
a
considerable
extent
and
material
things
curious
as
it
may
appear
prospered
with
him
but
he
rarely
spoke
unless
obliged
to
do
so
and
whenever
he
felt
himself
at
leisure
and
knew
that
his
work
was
not
calling
for
him
he
seemed
to
relapse
into
the
state
which
was
his
more
real
life
then
he
would
pass
through
the
village
and
slowly
climb
the
slope
to
the
stile
where
he
would
stand
for
hours
together
patiently
gazing
before
him
while
he
murmured
the
old
refrain
between
the
stiles
she
said
i
shall
meet
them
there
between
the
stiles
fortunately
perhaps
it
was
not
often
he
attempted
to
climb
over
he
contented
himself
with
standing
and
gazing
fortunately
so
for
otherwise
the
changes
at
monksholdings
would
have
probably
terribly
shocked
his
abnormally
sensitive
brain
but
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
them
nor
the
new
route
of
the
old
agreed
to
by
the
compromise
he
was
content
with
his
post
standing
leaning
on
the
stile
and
gazing
before
him
his
of
course
was
the
worn
wistful
face
which
had
half
frightened
half
appealed
to
sybil
raynald
but
she
forgot
about
it
again
or
other
things
put
it
temporarily
aside
so
that
when
the
raynalds
came
down
to
monksholdings
again
the
following
easter
it
did
not
at
once
occur
to
her
to
remind
her
father
of
the
inquiry
he
had
promised
to
make
miss
march
was
not
with
her
pupils
and
their
parents
at
first
she
had
gone
to
spend
a
holiday
week
with
the
friends
who
had
brought
her
up
and
seen
to
her
education
good
benevolent
people
if
not
specially
sympathetic
but
to
whom
she
felt
herself
bound
by
ties
of
sincerest
gratitude
though
her
five
years
with
the
raynald
family
had
given
her
more
of
the
feeling
of
a
home
than
she
had
ever
had
before
and
her
arrival
at
monksholdings
was
the
occasion
of
much
rejoicing
there
was
everything
to
show
her
and
every
one
from
mark
down
to
little
robin
wanted
to
be
her
guide
it
was
not
till
the
morning
of
the
next
day
that
sybil
managed
to
get
her
to
herself
for
a
stroll
ellinor
had
some
things
to
tell
her
quondam
pupil
bellairs
her
guardian
was
growing
old
and
somewhat
feeble
i
fear
she
is
not
likely
to
live
many
years
said
miss
march
and
she
thinks
so
herself
she
has
a
curious
longing
which
i
never
saw
in
her
before
to
find
out
my
history
to
know
if
there
is
no
one
really
belonging
to
me
to
whom
she
can
give
me
back
as
it
were
before
she
dies
she
gave
me
the
little
parcel
containing
the
clothes
i
had
on
when
she
rescued
me
from
being
sent
to
a
workhouse
they
are
carefully
washed
and
mended
and
though
i
was
a
poor
dirty
little
object
when
i
was
found
they
do
not
look
really
as
if
i
had
been
a
beggar
child
with
a
little
smile
you
a
beggar
child
exclaimed
sybil
indignantly
of
course
not
perhaps
on
the
contrary
you
were
somebody
very
grand
no
no
said
ellinor
sensibly
in
that
case
i
should
have
been
advertised
for
and
inquired
after
no
i
have
never
thought
that
and
i
should
not
wish
it
i
should
be
more
than
thankful
to
know
i
came
of
good
honest
people
however
simple
to
have
some
one
of
my
very
own
i
forget
the
actual
details
said
sybil
though
you
have
often
told
me
about
it
you
were
found
no
not
literally
in
the
workhouse
was
it
they
were
going
to
take
me
there
said
miss
march
it
was
at
a
village
near
bath
where
and
bellairs
were
then
living
and
one
day
after
a
party
of
gipsies
had
been
encamping
on
the
common
a
cottager
wife
heard
something
crying
in
the
night
and
found
me
in
her
little
garden
she
was
too
poor
to
keep
me
herself
and
felt
certain
i
was
a
child
the
gipsies
had
stolen
and
then
wanted
to
get
rid
of
i
was
and
not
like
them
she
was
a
friend
or
relation
of
some
of
bellairs
servants
and
so
the
story
got
round
to
my
kind
old
friend
and
you
know
the
rest
how
they
first
thought
of
bringing
me
up
in
quite
a
humble
way
and
then
finding
me
well
intelligent
and
naturally
rather
refined
i
suppose
i
got
a
really
good
education
and
my
good
luck
did
not
desert
me
dear
when
i
came
to
be
your
governess
sybil
smiled
and
can
you
remember
ellinor
hesitated
queer
dreamy
fragments
come
back
to
me
sometimes
she
said
i
have
a
feeling
of
having
seen
hills
long
long
ago
it
is
strange
she
went
on
for
by
this
time
they
had
left
the
private
grounds
and
were
strolling
along
the
in
the
direction
of
the
town
it
is
strange
that
since
i
came
here
i
seem
to
have
got
hold
of
a
tiny
bit
of
these
old
memories
if
they
are
such
it
must
be
the
hills
and
she
stood
still
and
gazed
round
her
with
a
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
i
could
only
have
been
between
two
and
three
when
i
was
found
she
went
on
the
only
words
i
said
were
and
it
sounded
like
that
was
why
bellairs
called
me
and
because
it
was
in
that
month
she
took
me
to
her
house
sybil
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
it
such
a
romantic
story
she
said
at
last
i
am
never
tired
of
thinking
about
it
they
entered
monksholdings
again
from
the
east
entrance
ellinor
glanced
at
the
stile
she
said
this
is
one
of
the
two
old
stiles
i
suppose
have
you
ever
seen
your
ghost
again
sybil
have
you
found
out
anything
about
him
sybil
looked
round
her
half
nervously
it
is
the
other
stile
he
haunts
she
said
i
rather
avoid
it
at
least
i
mean
to
do
so
now
it
is
curious
you
speak
of
it
for
till
yesterday
i
had
not
seen
him
again
and
had
almost
forgotten
about
it
but
yesterday
afternoon
just
before
you
came
there
he
was
exactly
the
same
staring
in
i
meant
to
speak
to
papa
about
it
but
with
the
pleasure
and
bustle
of
your
arrival
i
forgot
it
remind
me
about
it
i
am
afraid
he
is
out
of
his
mind
poor
old
man
said
ellinor
i
wish
we
could
do
something
to
comfort
him
i
feel
as
if
everybody
be
happy
here
it
is
such
a
charming
exhilarating
place
dear
me
how
windy
it
is
the
path
is
all
strewn
with
the
white
petals
of
the
cherry
blossom
they
have
degenerated
into
wild
cherry
trees
said
sybil
long
ago
papa
says
these
must
have
been
good
fruit
trees
of
many
kinds
and
this
is
a
great
cherry
country
you
know
the
wind
dropped
that
afternoon
but
only
temporarily
it
rose
again
so
much
during
the
night
that
by
the
next
morning
the
grounds
looked
to
use
little
annis
expression
quite
untidy
and
down
in
the
village
or
just
beyond
it
said
mark
who
had
been
for
an
early
stroll
at
one
place
it
really
looks
as
if
it
had
been
snowing
the
road
skirts
that
old
farmhouse
you
know
it
father
i
forget
the
name
there
a
grand
cherry
orchard
there
farm
you
must
mean
said
raynald
farmer
giles
oh
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
sybil
but
a
glance
round
the
table
made
him
stop
short
they
were
at
breakfast
he
scarcely
felt
inclined
to
relate
the
tragic
story
before
the
younger
children
they
might
look
frightened
or
run
away
if
they
came
across
the
poor
fellow
he
reflected
i
will
tell
sybil
about
it
afterwards
easter
holidays
were
not
yet
over
though
the
governess
had
returned
so
regular
routine
was
set
aside
and
the
whole
of
the
young
party
ellinor
included
spent
that
morning
in
a
scramble
among
the
hills
the
children
seemed
untirable
and
set
off
again
somewhere
or
other
in
the
afternoon
sybil
was
busy
with
her
mother
writing
letters
and
orders
to
be
despatched
to
london
so
that
towards
four
or
so
when
miss
march
having
finished
her
own
correspondence
entered
the
she
found
it
deserted
sybil
had
promised
to
practise
some
duets
with
her
and
while
waiting
on
the
chance
of
her
coming
ellinor
seated
herself
at
the
piano
and
began
to
play
nothing
very
important
just
snatches
of
old
airs
which
she
wove
into
a
kind
of
harmony
one
melting
into
another
as
they
occurred
to
her
all
at
once
a
shadow
fell
on
the
keys
and
then
she
remembered
having
heard
the
door
softly
open
a
moment
or
two
before
so
softly
that
she
had
not
looked
round
imagining
it
to
be
the
wind
which
though
fallen
now
still
lingered
about
now
her
ideas
took
another
shape
it
is
sybil
no
doubt
she
thought
with
a
smile
she
is
going
to
make
me
jump
and
she
waited
half
expecting
to
feel
sybil
hands
suddenly
clasped
over
her
eyes
from
behind
but
this
was
not
to
be
the
mode
of
attack
apparently
though
she
heard
what
sounded
like
stealthy
footsteps
you
need
not
try
to
startle
me
sybbie
she
exclaimed
laughingly
without
turning
or
ceasing
to
play
i
hear
you
it
was
no
laughing
voice
which
replied
on
the
contrary
a
sigh
almost
a
groan
close
to
her
made
her
look
up
sharply
a
trifle
indignant
perhaps
at
the
joke
being
carried
so
far
and
she
saw
a
pace
or
two
from
her
only
the
figure
of
an
old
man
a
somewhat
bent
form
a
worn
face
with
wistful
blue
eyes
gazing
at
her
she
had
scarcely
time
to
feel
frightened
for
almost
instantaneously
sybil
ghost
recurred
to
her
memory
he
has
found
his
way
in
then
she
thought
not
without
a
slight
and
natural
tremor
which
however
disappeared
as
she
gazed
so
pathetically
gentle
was
the
whole
aspect
of
the
intruder
but
his
face
changed
curiously
the
sight
of
hers
now
fully
in
his
view
seemed
strangely
to
affect
him
with
a
gesture
of
utter
bewilderment
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
forehead
as
if
to
brush
something
away
the
cloud
still
resting
on
his
brain
then
a
smile
broke
over
the
old
face
a
wonderful
smile
marion
he
said
at
last
i
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
i
heard
you
playing
in
my
dream
it
is
the
right
place
though
between
the
stiles
you
said
i
have
waited
so
long
and
come
so
often
and
now
it
is
snowing
again
just
a
little
dear
nothing
to
hurt
marion
my
darling
why
do
you
speak
is
it
all
a
dream
this
fine
room
the
music
and
all
are
a
dream
he
closed
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
fainting
inexpressibly
touched
all
ellinor
womanly
nature
went
out
to
him
she
started
forward
half
leading
half
lifting
him
to
a
seat
close
at
hand
i
i
am
not
marion
she
said
and
afterwards
she
wondered
what
had
inspired
the
words
but
i
am
not
ellinor
something
made
her
change
the
name
as
he
spoke
i
am
nelly
he
opened
his
eyes
again
little
nell
he
said
has
she
sent
you
down
to
me
from
heaven
my
little
nell
and
then
he
fell
back
unconscious
this
time
he
had
fainted
she
thought
he
was
dead
but
it
was
not
so
her
cries
for
help
soon
brought
her
friends
raynald
first
of
all
he
did
not
seem
startled
he
soothed
ellinor
at
once
it
is
poor
old
giles
he
said
i
know
all
about
him
he
has
found
his
way
in
at
last
but
but
stammered
the
girl
there
is
something
else
raynald
i
i
seem
to
remember
something
she
looked
nearly
as
white
as
their
poor
visitor
and
as
raynald
glanced
at
her
a
curious
expression
flitted
across
his
own
face
could
it
be
so
he
knew
all
her
story
wait
a
little
my
dear
he
said
we
must
attend
to
poor
giles
first
they
were
very
kind
and
tender
to
the
old
man
but
he
seemed
to
be
barely
conscious
even
after
restoratives
had
brought
him
out
of
the
actual
fainting
fit
then
raynald
proposed
that
his
servants
his
housekeeper
if
he
had
one
should
be
sent
for
and
when
faithful
betsy
stout
as
of
old
though
less
nimble
made
her
appearance
her
irrepressible
emotion
at
the
sight
of
ellinor
pale
and
trembling
though
the
young
governess
was
gave
form
and
substance
to
raynald
suspicions
yes
they
had
met
at
last
father
and
daughter
between
the
stiles
he
was
dada
she
was
little
nell
might
it
not
be
that
marion
prayers
had
brought
them
together
every
reasonable
proof
was
forthcoming
the
little
parcel
of
clothes
the
correspondence
in
the
dates
the
strong
resemblance
to
her
mother
and
joy
does
not
often
kill
barnett
was
able
to
understand
it
all
better
than
might
have
been
expected
he
was
never
himself
but
infinitely
better
both
in
mind
and
body
than
poor
old
betsy
had
ever
dreamt
of
seeing
him
and
he
was
perfectly
content
content
to
live
as
long
as
it
should
please
god
to
spare
him
to
his
little
nell
ready
to
go
to
his
marion
when
the
time
should
come
and
ellinor
had
her
wish
a
home
though
not
a
grand
one
some
one
of
her
very
own
to
care
for
a
father
devoted
love
and
to
complete
her
happiness
the
friends
who
had
grown
so
dear
to
her
close
at
hand
more
may
yet
be
hers
in
the
future
for
she
is
still
young
her
father
may
live
to
see
his
grandchildren
playing
about
the
farmstead
at
mayling
so
that
though
the
name
be
changed
the
old
stock
will
still
nourish
where
so
many
generations
of
its
ancestors
have
sown
and
reaped
at
the
dip
of
the
road
have
i
ever
seen
a
ghost
i
do
not
know
that
is
the
only
reply
i
can
truthfully
make
to
the
question
so
often
asked
and
sometimes
if
inquirers
care
to
hear
more
i
go
on
to
tell
them
the
one
experience
which
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
reply
positively
either
in
the
affirmative
or
negative
and
restricts
me
to
i
do
not
know
this
was
the
story
i
was
staying
with
relations
in
the
country
not
a
very
isolated
or
part
of
the
world
and
yet
rather
inconvenient
of
access
by
the
railway
for
the
nearest
station
was
six
miles
off
though
the
family
i
was
visiting
were
nearly
connected
with
me
i
did
not
know
much
of
their
home
or
its
neighbourhood
as
the
head
of
the
house
an
uncle
of
mine
by
marriage
had
only
come
into
the
property
a
year
or
two
previously
to
the
date
of
which
i
am
writing
through
the
death
of
an
elder
brother
it
was
a
nice
place
a
good
comfortable
old
house
a
prosperous
satisfactory
estate
everything
about
it
was
in
good
order
from
the
farmers
who
always
paid
their
rents
to
the
shooting
which
was
always
good
from
the
vineries
which
were
noted
to
the
woods
where
the
earliest
primroses
in
all
the
country
side
were
yearly
to
be
found
and
my
uncle
and
aunt
and
their
family
deserved
these
pleasant
things
and
made
a
good
use
of
them
but
there
was
a
touch
of
the
commonplace
about
it
all
there
was
nothing
picturesque
or
romantic
the
country
was
flat
though
fertile
the
house
though
old
was
conveniently
modern
in
its
arrangements
airy
cheery
and
bright
not
even
a
ghost
or
the
shadow
of
one
i
remember
saying
one
day
with
a
faint
grumble
ah
well
as
to
that
said
my
uncle
perhaps
we
but
just
then
something
interrupted
him
and
i
forgot
his
unfinished
speech
into
the
happy
party
of
which
for
the
time
being
i
was
one
there
fell
one
morning
a
sudden
thunderbolt
of
calamity
the
post
brought
news
of
the
alarming
illness
of
the
eldest
daughter
frances
married
a
year
or
two
ago
and
living
as
the
crow
flies
at
no
very
great
distance
but
as
the
crow
flies
is
not
always
as
the
railroad
runs
and
to
reach
the
aldoyns
home
from
fawne
court
my
uncle
place
was
a
complicated
business
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
go
and
return
in
a
day
can
one
of
you
come
over
wrote
the
young
husband
she
is
already
out
of
danger
but
longing
to
see
her
mother
or
one
of
you
she
is
worrying
about
the
baby
a
child
of
a
few
months
old
and
wishing
for
nurse
we
looked
at
each
other
nurse
must
go
at
once
said
my
uncle
to
me
as
the
eldest
of
the
party
perhaps
i
should
here
say
that
i
am
a
widow
though
not
old
and
with
no
close
ties
or
responsibilities
but
for
your
aunt
it
is
impossible
quite
so
i
agreed
for
she
was
at
the
moment
painfully
lamed
by
rheumatism
and
the
other
girls
are
almost
too
young
at
such
a
crisis
my
uncle
continued
would
you
charlotte
and
he
hesitated
it
would
be
such
a
comfort
to
have
personal
news
of
her
of
course
i
will
go
i
said
nurse
and
i
can
start
at
once
i
will
leave
her
there
and
return
alone
to
give
you
i
have
no
doubt
better
news
of
poor
francie
he
was
full
of
gratitude
so
were
they
all
do
hurry
back
said
my
uncle
stay
till
till
monday
if
you
like
but
i
could
not
promise
i
knew
they
would
be
glad
of
news
at
once
and
in
a
small
house
like
my
cousin
at
such
a
time
an
inmate
the
more
might
be
inconvenient
i
will
try
to
return
i
said
and
as
i
sprang
into
the
carriage
i
added
send
to
moore
to
meet
the
last
train
unless
i
telegraph
to
the
contrary
my
uncle
nodded
the
boys
called
after
me
all
right
the
old
butler
bowed
assent
and
i
was
satisfied
nurse
and
i
reached
our
journey
end
promptly
considering
the
four
or
five
junctions
at
which
we
had
to
change
carriages
but
on
the
whole
going
the
trains
fitted
astonishingly
we
found
frances
better
delighted
to
see
us
eager
for
news
of
her
mother
and
finally
disposed
to
sleep
peacefully
now
that
she
knew
that
there
was
an
experienced
person
in
charge
and
both
she
and
her
husband
thanked
me
so
much
that
i
felt
ashamed
of
the
little
i
had
done
aldoyn
begged
me
to
stay
till
monday
but
the
house
was
upset
and
i
was
eager
to
carry
back
my
good
tidings
they
are
meeting
me
at
moore
by
the
last
train
i
said
no
thank
you
i
think
it
is
best
to
go
you
will
have
an
uncomfortable
journey
he
replied
it
is
saturday
and
the
trains
will
be
late
and
the
stations
crowded
with
the
market
people
it
will
be
horrid
for
you
charlotte
but
i
persisted
it
rather
horrid
and
it
was
queer
there
was
a
sort
of
uncanny
eeriness
about
that
saturday
evening
journey
that
i
have
never
forgotten
the
season
was
very
early
spring
it
was
not
very
cold
but
chilly
and
ungenial
and
there
were
such
odd
sorts
of
people
about
i
travelled
for
i
am
not
rich
and
i
am
very
independent
i
did
not
want
my
uncle
to
pay
my
fare
for
i
liked
the
feeling
of
rendering
him
some
small
service
in
return
for
his
steady
kindness
to
me
the
first
stage
of
my
journey
was
performed
in
the
company
of
two
old
naturalists
travelling
to
scotland
to
look
for
some
small
plant
which
was
to
be
found
only
in
one
spot
in
the
highlands
this
i
gathered
from
their
talk
to
each
other
you
never
saw
two
such
extraordinary
creatures
as
they
were
they
both
wore
black
kid
gloves
much
too
large
for
them
and
the
ends
of
the
fingers
waved
about
like
feathers
then
followed
two
or
three
short
transits
interspersed
with
weary
waitings
at
stations
the
last
of
these
was
the
worst
and
tantalising
too
for
by
this
time
i
was
within
a
few
miles
of
moore
the
station
was
crowded
with
rough
folk
all
it
seemed
to
me
more
or
less
tipsy
so
i
took
refuge
in
a
dark
on
the
small
side
line
by
which
i
was
to
proceed
where
i
felt
i
might
have
been
robbed
and
murdered
and
no
one
the
wiser
but
at
last
came
my
slow
little
train
and
in
i
jumped
to
jump
out
again
still
more
joyfully
some
fifteen
minutes
later
when
we
drew
up
at
moore
i
peered
about
for
the
carriage
it
was
not
to
be
seen
only
two
or
three
or
farmers
vehicles
standing
about
while
their
owners
it
was
easy
to
hear
were
drinking
far
more
than
was
good
for
them
in
the
taproom
of
the
unicorn
thence
nevertheless
not
to
the
taproom
but
to
the
front
of
the
inn
i
made
my
way
though
not
undismayed
by
the
shouts
and
roars
breaking
the
stillness
of
the
quiet
night
was
the
fawne
court
carriage
not
here
i
asked
the
landlady
was
a
woman
especially
civil
to
any
member
of
the
court
family
but
she
shook
her
head
no
no
carriage
had
been
down
there
must
have
been
some
mistake
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
till
she
could
somehow
or
other
disinter
a
fly
and
a
horse
and
worst
of
all
a
driver
for
the
men
she
had
to
call
were
all
rather
well
you
see
it
saturday
night
we
were
expecting
any
one
and
when
after
waiting
half
an
hour
the
fly
at
last
emerged
my
heart
almost
failed
me
even
before
he
drove
out
of
the
yard
it
was
very
plain
that
if
ever
we
reached
fawne
court
alive
it
would
certainly
be
more
thanks
to
good
luck
than
to
the
driver
management
but
the
horse
was
old
and
the
man
had
a
sort
of
instinct
about
him
we
got
on
all
right
till
we
were
more
than
half
way
to
our
journey
end
the
road
was
straight
and
the
moonlight
bright
especially
after
we
had
passed
a
certain
corner
and
got
well
out
of
the
shade
of
the
trees
which
skirted
the
first
part
of
the
way
just
past
this
turn
there
came
a
dip
in
the
road
it
went
down
down
gradually
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
and
i
looked
up
anxiously
fearful
of
the
horse
taking
advantage
of
the
slope
but
no
he
jogged
on
if
possible
more
slowly
than
before
though
new
terrors
assailed
me
when
i
saw
that
the
driver
was
now
fast
asleep
his
head
swaying
from
side
to
side
with
extraordinary
regularity
after
a
bit
i
grew
easier
again
he
seemed
to
keep
his
equilibrium
and
i
looked
out
at
the
side
window
on
the
landscape
with
some
interest
i
had
never
seen
brighter
moonlight
suddenly
from
out
of
the
intense
stillness
and
loneliness
a
figure
a
human
figure
became
visible
it
was
that
of
a
man
a
young
and
active
man
running
along
the
footpath
a
few
feet
to
our
left
apparently
from
some
whim
keeping
pace
with
the
fly
my
first
feeling
was
of
satisfaction
that
i
was
no
longer
alone
at
the
tender
mercies
of
my
stupefied
charioteer
but
as
i
gazed
a
slight
misgiving
came
over
me
who
could
it
be
running
along
this
lonely
road
so
late
and
what
was
his
motive
in
keeping
up
with
us
so
steadily
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
had
been
waiting
for
us
yet
that
of
course
was
impossible
he
was
not
very
certainly
he
was
that
is
to
say
like
a
superior
gamekeeper
his
figure
was
remarkably
good
tall
and
slight
and
he
ran
gracefully
but
there
was
something
queer
about
him
and
suddenly
the
curiosity
that
had
mingled
in
my
observation
of
him
was
entirely
submerged
in
alarm
when
i
saw
that
as
he
ran
he
was
slowly
but
steadily
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
fly
in
another
moment
he
will
be
opening
the
door
and
jumping
in
i
thought
and
i
glanced
before
me
only
to
see
that
the
driver
was
more
hopelessly
asleep
than
before
there
was
no
chance
of
his
hearing
if
i
called
out
and
get
out
i
could
not
without
attracting
the
strange
runner
attention
for
as
would
have
it
the
window
was
drawn
up
on
the
right
side
and
i
could
not
open
the
door
without
rattling
the
glass
while
worse
and
worse
the
left
hand
window
was
down
even
that
slight
protection
wanting
i
looked
out
once
more
by
this
time
the
figure
was
close
close
to
the
fly
then
an
arm
was
stretched
out
and
laid
along
the
edge
of
the
door
as
if
preparatory
to
opening
it
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
saw
his
face
it
was
a
young
face
but
terribly
horribly
pale
and
ghastly
and
the
eyes
all
was
so
visible
in
the
moonlight
had
an
expression
such
as
i
had
never
seen
before
or
since
it
terrified
me
though
afterwards
on
recalling
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
might
have
been
more
a
look
of
agonised
appeal
than
of
menace
of
any
kind
i
cowered
back
into
my
corner
and
shut
my
eyes
feigning
sleep
it
was
the
only
idea
that
occurred
to
me
my
heart
was
beating
like
a
sledge
hammer
all
sorts
of
thoughts
rushed
through
me
among
them
i
remember
saying
to
myself
he
must
be
an
escaped
lunatic
his
eyes
are
so
awfully
wild
how
long
i
sat
thus
i
do
know
whenever
i
dared
to
glance
out
furtively
he
was
still
there
but
all
at
once
a
strange
feeling
of
relief
came
over
me
i
sat
up
yes
he
was
gone
and
though
as
i
took
courage
i
leant
out
and
looked
round
in
every
direction
not
a
trace
of
him
was
to
be
seen
though
the
road
and
the
fields
were
bare
and
clear
for
a
long
distance
round
when
i
got
to
fawne
court
i
had
to
wake
the
every
one
was
asleep
but
my
uncle
was
still
up
though
not
expecting
me
and
very
distressed
he
was
at
the
mistake
about
the
carriage
however
he
concluded
all
well
that
ends
well
it
delightful
to
have
your
good
news
but
you
look
sadly
pale
and
tired
charlotte
then
i
told
him
of
my
fright
it
seemed
now
so
foolish
of
me
i
said
but
my
uncle
did
not
smile
on
the
contrary
my
dear
he
said
it
sounds
very
like
our
ghost
though
of
course
it
may
have
been
only
one
of
the
keepers
he
told
me
the
story
many
years
ago
in
his
grandfather
time
a
young
and
favourite
gamekeeper
had
been
found
dead
in
a
field
skirting
the
road
down
there
there
was
no
sign
of
violence
upon
the
body
it
was
never
explained
what
had
killed
him
but
he
had
had
in
his
charge
a
watch
a
very
valuable
one
which
his
master
for
some
reason
or
other
had
handed
to
him
to
take
home
to
the
house
not
wishing
to
keep
it
on
him
and
when
the
body
was
found
late
that
night
the
watch
was
not
on
it
since
then
so
the
story
goes
on
a
moonlight
night
the
spirit
of
the
poor
fellow
haunts
the
spot
it
is
supposed
that
he
wants
to
tell
what
had
become
of
his
master
watch
which
was
never
found
but
no
one
has
ever
had
courage
to
address
him
he
never
comes
farther
than
the
dip
in
the
road
said
my
uncle
if
you
had
spoken
to
him
charlotte
i
wonder
if
he
would
have
told
you
his
secret
he
spoke
half
laughingly
but
i
have
never
quite
forgiven
myself
for
my
cowardice
it
was
the
look
in
those
eyes
will
not
take
place
murmured
captain
murray
as
he
ran
his
eye
down
the
column
of
the
morning
paper
specially
devoted
to
fashionable
intelligence
lingard
arthur
lingard
yes
i
met
him
a
very
good
fellow
and
trevannion
do
you
know
a
miss
trevannion
bessie
murray
glanced
up
from
her
teacups
what
do
you
say
walter
trevannion
yes
i
have
met
a
girl
of
the
name
at
my
aunt
a
pretty
girl
and
i
think
i
heard
she
was
going
to
be
married
is
that
what
you
are
talking
about
no
her
husband
replied
it
the
other
way
broken
off
i
wonder
why
what
an
old
gossip
you
are
said
murray
no
good
reason
at
all
i
daresay
people
are
so
capricious
still
they
do
often
announce
a
marriage
till
it
pretty
certain
to
come
off
this
sort
of
thing
tapping
the
paper
as
he
spoke
exactly
pleasant
very
much
the
reverse
agreed
murray
and
then
they
thought
no
more
about
it
i
wonder
why
said
a
good
many
people
that
morning
when
they
caught
sight
of
the
announcement
for
the
two
principals
it
concerned
arthur
lingard
especially
had
a
large
circle
of
friends
and
acquaintances
and
their
engagement
had
been
the
subject
of
much
and
hearty
congratulation
it
seemed
so
natural
and
fitting
that
these
two
should
marry
both
young
amiable
and
sufficiently
well
off
even
the
most
cynical
could
discern
no
cloud
in
the
bright
sky
of
their
future
no
crook
in
the
lot
before
them
and
now
no
marvel
that
captain
murray
soliloquy
was
repeated
by
many
but
who
would
have
guessed
that
in
one
heart
it
was
ever
ringing
with
maddening
anguish
i
wonder
why
oh
i
wonder
why
he
has
done
it
oh
if
he
would
but
tell
me
it
could
not
surely
seem
quite
so
unendurable
and
daisy
trevannion
pressed
her
aching
head
and
her
poor
swollen
eyes
on
to
her
mother
loving
bosom
in
a
sort
of
wild
despair
mamma
mamma
she
cried
help
me
i
can
not
be
angry
with
him
i
wish
i
could
he
was
so
gentle
so
sweet
and
he
is
so
heartbroken
i
can
see
by
his
letter
oh
mamma
what
can
it
be
but
to
this
even
the
devoted
mother
who
would
gladly
have
given
her
own
life
to
save
her
child
this
misery
could
find
no
answer
this
was
what
had
happened
they
had
been
engaged
about
three
months
the
wedding
day
was
approximately
fixed
when
one
morning
the
blow
fell
a
letter
to
daisy
father
enclosing
one
to
herself
a
letter
which
made
trevannion
draw
his
brows
together
in
instinctive
indignation
and
then
as
the
first
impulse
cooled
a
little
caused
him
to
turn
to
his
daughter
with
a
movement
of
irritation
underneath
which
hope
had
nevertheless
found
time
to
reassert
itself
daisy
he
exclaimed
sharply
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
nonsense
have
you
been
quarrelling
with
lingard
you
a
bit
of
a
spoilt
child
i
know
my
dear
but
i
do
like
playing
with
edged
tools
a
man
like
arthur
wo
stand
being
trifled
with
do
you
hear
daisy
eh
what
for
the
girl
had
scarcely
caught
the
sense
of
his
words
so
absorbed
was
she
in
those
of
the
short
all
too
short
but
terrible
letter
she
had
just
read
the
letter
addressed
to
herself
which
began
daisy
my
daisy
for
the
last
time
and
ended
abruptly
with
the
simple
signature
arthur
lingard
she
gazed
up
at
her
father
her
white
face
all
drawn
and
as
it
were
withered
with
that
minute
agony
her
eyes
dulled
and
yet
wild
never
was
there
such
a
metamorphosis
from
the
happy
laughing
girl
who
had
hurried
in
with
some
pretty
excuse
for
her
unpunctuality
daisy
my
child
daisy
her
father
repeated
repenting
already
of
his
hasty
remarks
do
take
it
so
seriously
margaret
to
his
wife
speak
to
her
and
trevannion
as
pale
almost
as
her
daughter
drew
the
sheet
of
from
the
girl
unresisting
hands
while
her
husband
held
out
to
her
his
own
letter
some
complete
mistake
she
said
some
misplaced
quixotry
daisy
my
own
darling
do
not
take
it
so
seriously
your
father
will
see
him
you
will
will
you
not
hugh
detecting
the
proud
hesitation
in
her
husband
face
it
is
not
as
if
we
did
not
know
him
well
and
all
about
him
your
father
will
find
out
daisy
and
make
it
all
right
trevannion
did
not
contradict
her
but
murmured
some
consolatory
words
and
then
the
mother
led
daisy
away
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
girl
allowed
herself
to
be
reassured
i
will
consult
keir
if
necessary
said
the
father
when
out
of
hearing
of
his
daughter
he
is
the
natural
person
both
as
our
own
connection
and
because
he
introduced
lingard
and
thinks
so
highly
of
him
but
first
i
will
see
arthur
alone
the
fewer
mixed
up
in
such
a
case
the
better
trevannion
agreed
she
was
constitutionally
sanguine
but
a
painful
idea
struck
her
as
her
husband
spoke
hugh
she
said
hesitatingly
you
do
think
it
surely
is
not
possible
that
his
that
arthur
brain
is
affected
his
brain
tut
nonsense
what
a
woman
idea
replied
trevannion
irritably
why
he
is
receiving
compliments
on
every
side
from
the
very
highest
quarters
too
on
that
article
of
his
on
the
capricorn
islands
brain
affected
indeed
and
to
a
whisper
of
i
was
thinking
of
which
followed
him
apologetically
he
vouchsafed
no
reply
some
intensely
trying
days
passed
trevannion
interview
with
his
recalcitrant
proved
a
complete
failure
nothing
absolutely
nothing
was
to
be
got
out
of
the
fellow
he
told
his
wife
in
mingled
anger
and
wretchedness
for
the
poor
man
was
a
devoted
father
arthur
was
gentleness
itself
respectful
deferential
even
to
the
man
whose
peculiarly
disagreeable
position
he
felt
for
inexpressibly
but
he
was
as
firm
as
hard
in
his
decision
that
all
should
be
must
be
over
between
miss
trevannion
and
himself
as
if
his
own
heart
had
suddenly
turned
to
iron
as
if
he
possessed
no
feelings
at
all
he
grew
white
to
the
lips
with
a
terrible
whiteness
when
he
named
her
he
said
with
a
quiet
deliberate
emphasis
more
impressive
by
far
than
any
passionate
declaration
that
never
never
while
he
lived
would
he
forgive
himself
for
the
trouble
he
had
brought
into
her
young
life
but
that
he
was
powerless
to
do
otherwise
he
was
absolutely
without
a
choice
as
to
the
reason
for
the
breaking
off
of
the
engagement
to
be
given
to
the
world
he
left
it
entirely
in
the
trevannions
own
hands
he
would
contradict
nothing
they
thought
it
best
to
say
but
if
possible
he
grew
still
whiter
when
his
visitor
from
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
glanced
at
him
with
a
look
of
contempt
while
he
replied
cuttingly
that
he
had
no
love
of
falsehood
for
his
part
he
would
tell
the
truth
and
in
the
end
he
believed
it
would
be
best
for
daisy
that
all
the
world
should
know
the
way
in
which
she
had
been
treated
best
for
her
and
worst
for
you
he
repeated
and
arthur
only
said
i
hope
so
it
must
be
as
you
think
well
then
trevannion
softened
again
a
little
i
shall
say
nothing
to
any
one
at
present
he
went
on
i
must
see
keir
possibly
he
may
understand
you
better
than
i
can
but
no
it
will
be
no
use
the
young
man
repeated
coldly
though
his
very
heart
was
wrung
for
the
father
crushing
down
his
own
pride
while
he
thought
he
saw
still
the
ghost
of
a
hope
it
will
be
no
use
no
one
can
do
anything
and
you
adhere
to
your
determination
not
to
see
my
not
to
see
daisy
again
lingard
bowed
his
head
and
trevannion
left
him
philip
keir
was
no
blood
relation
of
the
trevannions
but
a
cousin
by
marriage
and
a
very
intimate
friend
he
was
some
years
older
than
lingard
and
it
was
through
him
that
the
acquaintance
resulting
in
daisy
engagement
had
begun
he
was
a
reserved
man
with
a
frank
and
cordial
manner
daisy
thought
she
knew
him
well
but
as
to
this
she
was
in
some
directions
entirely
mistaken
he
was
away
from
home
when
trevannion
called
on
him
driving
straight
to
his
chambers
from
the
fruitless
interview
with
lingard
philip
did
not
return
for
a
couple
of
days
and
had
left
no
address
hence
ensued
the
painful
interval
of
suspense
alluded
to
but
on
the
third
evening
a
hansom
dashed
up
to
the
trevannions
door
and
keir
jumped
out
it
was
late
but
there
was
no
hesitation
as
to
admitting
him
i
found
your
note
he
said
as
he
grasped
his
host
hand
and
came
straight
on
i
have
only
just
got
back
what
is
the
matter
tell
me
at
once
he
was
a
man
but
his
agitation
was
evident
daisy
he
added
hastily
yes
replied
the
father
the
two
were
alone
in
his
study
poor
daisy
and
then
he
told
the
story
keir
listened
though
not
altogether
in
silence
for
broken
exclamations
which
he
seemed
unable
to
repress
broke
out
from
him
more
than
once
impossible
inconceivable
he
muttered
lingard
of
all
men
to
behave
like
a
he
stopped
short
at
a
loss
for
a
comparison
then
you
can
throw
no
light
upon
it
none
whatever
said
trevannion
we
had
hoped
foolishly
perhaps
i
had
somehow
hoped
that
you
might
have
helped
us
you
know
him
well
you
see
you
have
been
so
much
together
your
acquaintance
is
of
old
date
and
you
must
understand
any
peculiarities
of
his
character
his
tone
still
sounded
as
if
he
could
not
bring
himself
finally
to
accept
the
position
keir
was
inexpressibly
sorry
for
him
i
know
of
none
he
said
frankly
i
know
of
nothing
about
him
that
is
not
estimable
and
as
you
say
we
have
been
much
and
most
intimately
associated
we
have
travelled
together
half
over
the
world
we
have
been
dependent
on
each
other
for
months
at
a
time
and
the
more
i
have
seen
of
him
the
more
i
have
admired
and
yes
loved
him
if
i
had
to
pick
a
fault
in
him
i
would
say
it
is
a
curious
spice
of
obstinacy
i
have
seen
it
very
strongly
now
and
then
once
and
his
face
grew
grave
once
we
nearly
quarrelled
because
he
would
not
give
in
on
a
certain
point
it
was
in
siberia
not
long
ago
and
here
philip
gave
a
sort
of
shiver
it
was
very
horrible
no
need
to
go
into
details
he
arthur
got
it
into
his
head
that
a
particular
course
of
action
was
called
for
and
there
was
no
moving
him
however
it
ended
all
right
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
but
he
was
determined
trevannion
listened
but
vaguely
keir
remarks
scarcely
seemed
to
the
point
obstinate
he
repeated
yes
but
that
does
explain
things
there
was
no
question
of
giving
in
they
had
had
no
quarrel
daisy
was
perfectly
happy
the
only
thing
she
can
say
on
looking
back
over
the
last
week
or
two
closely
is
that
arthur
had
seemed
depressed
now
and
then
and
when
she
taxed
him
with
it
he
evaded
a
reply
you
do
think
philip
that
there
is
anything
of
that
kind
melancholia
you
know
in
his
family
bless
you
no
my
dear
sir
he
comes
of
the
healthiest
stock
possible
people
one
knows
all
about
for
generations
no
no
it
nothing
of
that
kind
keir
replied
and
what
man
ever
had
such
happy
prospects
then
what
in
heaven
name
is
it
said
trevannion
bringing
his
hand
down
violently
on
the
table
beside
which
they
were
sitting
can
you
get
it
out
of
him
if
you
can
do
nothing
else
for
us
philip
it
is
our
right
to
know
it
is
it
is
due
to
my
child
it
is
he
stopped
his
face
working
with
emotion
he
wo
see
her
you
know
he
added
disconnectedly
i
will
try
said
philip
it
is
indeed
the
least
i
can
do
if
if
i
could
get
him
to
see
her
daisy
surely
that
would
be
the
best
chance
trevannion
looked
at
him
sharply
scrutinisingly
you
you
are
satisfied
then
entirely
satisfied
that
there
is
nothing
we
need
dread
her
being
mixed
up
in
so
to
say
nothing
wrong
nothing
to
shock
a
girl
like
her
you
see
half
apologetically
his
refusing
to
see
her
makes
one
afraid
i
am
as
sure
of
him
as
of
myself
surer
said
philip
earnestly
there
is
nothing
in
his
past
to
explain
it
nothing
an
early
secret
marriage
a
wife
he
thought
dead
turning
up
again
suggested
the
father
it
sounds
absurd
sensational
but
after
all
there
must
be
some
reason
not
that
said
keir
getting
up
as
he
spoke
well
then
i
will
see
him
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
communicate
with
you
as
soon
as
possible
after
i
have
done
so
you
will
tell
trevannion
and
and
daisy
that
i
will
do
my
best
my
wife
is
still
in
the
will
you
not
see
her
philip
shook
his
head
it
is
late
he
said
and
i
am
dusty
and
unpresentable
besides
there
is
really
nothing
to
say
it
shall
be
as
you
all
think
best
i
will
see
trevannion
and
daisy
here
he
flushed
a
little
but
his
host
did
not
observe
it
if
you
like
and
if
she
wishes
it
heaven
send
i
may
have
better
news
than
i
expect
and
with
a
warm
pressure
of
his
old
friend
hand
keir
left
him
the
two
younger
men
met
the
next
morning
there
was
no
difficulty
about
it
for
lingard
knowing
by
instinct
that
the
interview
must
take
place
had
determined
to
face
it
so
of
the
two
he
was
the
more
prepared
the
more
forearmed
the
conversation
was
long
an
hour
two
hours
passed
before
poor
philip
could
make
up
his
mind
to
accept
the
ultimatum
contained
in
the
few
hard
words
with
which
arthur
lingard
first
greeted
him
i
know
what
you
have
come
about
i
knew
you
must
come
you
could
not
help
yourself
but
philip
it
will
save
you
pain
i
do
mind
for
myself
nothing
can
matter
now
if
you
will
at
once
take
my
word
for
it
that
nothing
you
can
say
will
do
the
least
shadow
of
good
no
shake
hands
with
me
i
would
rather
you
did
and
he
put
his
right
arm
behind
his
back
and
stood
there
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
facing
his
friend
philip
looked
up
at
him
grimly
no
he
said
i
given
my
word
to
to
these
poor
dear
people
and
i
stick
to
it
you
got
to
make
up
your
mind
to
a
lingard
but
through
or
below
the
grimness
was
a
terrible
pity
philip
heart
was
very
tender
for
the
man
whose
inexplicable
conduct
was
yet
filling
him
with
indignation
past
words
arthur
was
so
changed
the
last
week
or
two
had
done
the
work
of
years
all
the
youthfulness
the
almost
boyish
brightness
which
had
been
one
of
his
charms
was
gone
dead
he
was
pale
with
a
strange
indescribable
pallor
that
told
of
days
and
worse
still
of
nights
of
agony
the
lines
of
his
face
were
hardened
the
lips
spoke
of
unalterable
determination
only
once
had
philip
seen
him
look
thus
and
then
it
was
but
in
expression
the
likeness
and
the
contrast
struck
him
curiously
the
other
time
it
had
been
resolution
temporarily
hardening
a
youthful
face
now
what
did
it
remind
him
of
a
monk
who
had
gone
through
a
of
spiritual
struggle
alone
unaided
by
human
sympathy
a
martyr
no
there
was
no
enthusiasm
it
was
all
dull
dead
anguish
of
unalterable
resolve
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
keir
was
choking
down
an
uncomfortable
something
in
his
throat
and
bracing
himself
to
the
inquisitorial
torture
before
him
to
perform
well
said
arthur
at
last
and
philip
looked
up
at
him
again
how
queer
his
eyes
were
they
used
to
be
so
deeply
blue
daisy
had
often
laughed
at
his
changeable
eyes
as
she
called
them
blue
in
the
daytime
almost
black
at
night
but
always
lustrous
and
liquid
now
they
were
glassy
almost
filmy
what
was
it
a
sudden
thought
struck
philip
arthur
he
exclaimed
arthur
old
fellow
are
you
going
blind
is
that
the
mystery
if
it
is
that
good
lord
how
little
you
know
her
if
you
think
that
arthur
pale
lips
grew
visibly
paler
he
had
been
unprepared
for
attack
in
this
direction
and
for
the
moment
he
quailed
before
it
no
he
whispered
hoarsely
it
is
not
that
would
to
god
it
were
but
almost
instantly
he
had
mastered
himself
and
from
that
moment
throughout
the
interview
not
even
the
mention
of
daisy
name
had
power
to
stir
him
and
philip
annoyed
with
his
own
impulsiveness
stiffened
again
you
are
determined
not
to
reveal
your
secret
he
began
but
i
want
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
you
on
one
point
if
i
guess
it
if
i
put
my
finger
on
it
will
you
give
me
the
satisfaction
of
owning
that
i
have
done
so
lingard
hesitated
yes
he
said
i
will
do
so
on
one
condition
your
word
of
honour
your
oath
never
to
tell
it
to
any
human
being
not
to
her
daisy
least
of
all
philip
groaned
this
did
not
look
very
promising
for
the
meeting
with
daisy
which
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
believed
in
as
his
last
his
trump
card
still
he
had
gained
something
then
my
first
question
seems
in
the
face
of
that
almost
a
mockery
i
was
going
to
ask
you
and
he
half
gasped
it
is
nothing
nothing
about
her
that
is
at
the
root
of
all
this
misery
no
fancy
again
the
gasp
that
that
she
does
care
for
you
or
love
you
enough
no
nonsense
about
your
not
being
suited
to
each
other
or
that
you
could
make
a
girl
of
her
sensitive
nature
happy
no
said
arthur
and
the
word
seemed
to
ring
through
the
room
no
i
know
she
loves
me
as
i
love
her
oh
no
not
quite
like
that
i
trust
and
his
voice
was
firm
through
all
the
tragedy
of
the
last
sentence
and
i
believe
i
could
have
made
her
very
happy
leave
her
name
out
of
it
now
phil
once
for
all
it
has
nothing
to
do
personally
with
the
woman
who
is
and
always
will
be
to
me
my
perfect
ideal
of
sweetness
and
excellence
and
truth
and
beauty
then
it
has
to
do
with
yourself
murmured
keir
come
the
radius
is
narrowing
i
flew
out
at
poor
trevannion
when
he
suggested
it
but
all
the
same
it
nothing
in
your
past
you
ashamed
of
that
come
to
light
is
it
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
make
fools
of
themselves
sometimes
you
know
do
mind
my
asking
i
do
mind
said
arthur
wearily
but
it
no
use
no
it
nothing
like
that
i
have
done
nothing
i
am
ashamed
of
i
am
not
secretly
married
nor
have
i
committed
forgery
with
a
very
ghastly
attempt
at
a
smile
then
said
philip
is
it
something
about
your
family
have
you
found
out
that
there
a
strain
of
insanity
in
the
lingards
perhaps
people
exaggerate
that
kind
of
thing
there
a
touch
of
it
in
us
all
i
take
it
no
said
arthur
again
my
family
all
right
i
no
very
near
relations
except
my
sister
but
you
know
her
and
you
know
all
about
us
we
not
adventurers
in
any
sense
of
the
word
far
from
it
agreed
philip
warmly
then
for
a
moment
or
two
he
relapsed
into
silence
does
your
sister
does
lady
west
know
about
about
this
mysterious
affair
he
asked
abruptly
after
some
pondering
nothing
whatever
i
of
course
was
bound
by
every
consideration
not
to
tell
her
to
tell
no
one
anything
till
it
was
understood
by
the
trevannions
and
i
had
no
reason
for
consulting
her
or
any
friend
arthur
replied
he
spoke
jerkily
and
with
effort
as
if
he
were
putting
force
on
himself
to
endure
what
yet
he
was
convinced
was
absolutely
useless
torture
but
his
words
gave
keir
a
new
opening
which
he
was
quick
to
seize
that
just
it
he
exclaimed
eagerly
that
just
where
it
strikes
me
you
gone
wrong
you
should
have
consulted
some
one
not
myself
not
your
sister
even
i
do
say
whom
but
some
one
sensible
and
trustworthy
i
believe
your
mind
has
got
warped
you
been
thinking
over
this
trouble
whatever
it
is
till
you
ca
see
it
rightly
exaggerated
it
out
of
all
proportion
and
you
should
trust
your
own
morbid
judgment
lingard
did
not
answer
he
stood
motionless
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
for
an
instant
a
wild
hope
dashed
through
philip
that
at
last
he
had
made
some
impression
but
as
arthur
slowly
raised
his
dim
worn
eyes
and
looked
him
in
the
face
it
faded
again
even
before
the
young
man
spoke
to
satisfy
you
i
will
tell
you
this
much
i
have
consulted
one
person
a
man
whom
you
would
allow
was
trustworthy
and
wise
and
good
from
him
i
have
hidden
nothing
whatever
and
he
agrees
with
me
that
i
have
no
choice
that
duty
points
unmistakably
to
the
course
i
am
pursuing
again
a
flash
of
suggestion
struck
his
hearer
one
person
a
man
he
repeated
arthur
is
it
some
priest
have
they
been
converting
or
perverting
you
my
boy
are
you
going
over
to
rome
fancying
yourself
called
to
be
a
trappist
or
a
those
fellows
at
the
grande
chartreuse
you
remember
for
the
second
time
during
the
interview
arthur
smiled
and
his
smile
was
a
trifle
less
ghastly
this
time
no
again
he
said
you
quite
on
a
wrong
tack
i
have
not
the
slightest
inclination
that
way
i
i
wish
i
had
no
my
adviser
is
no
priest
but
he
one
of
the
best
of
men
all
the
same
and
one
of
the
wisest
you
wo
tell
me
who
he
is
i
can
not
and
philip
was
reluctant
to
try
his
last
hope
and
felt
conscious
that
he
would
do
it
clumsily
arthur
he
burst
out
you
will
see
her
daisy
once
more
she
has
a
right
to
it
you
are
putting
enough
upon
her
without
refusing
this
one
request
of
hers
he
stood
up
as
he
spoke
he
himself
had
grown
strangely
pale
and
seeing
this
as
he
glanced
at
him
lingard
own
face
became
ashen
he
shook
his
head
good
god
he
said
i
think
this
might
have
been
spared
me
no
i
will
not
see
her
again
the
only
thing
i
can
do
for
her
is
to
refuse
this
last
request
tell
her
so
philip
tell
her
what
i
say
and
now
leave
me
do
shake
hands
with
me
i
do
wish
it
and
i
daresay
you
do
if
if
we
never
meet
again
you
and
i
and
who
knows
if
this
is
our
goodbye
thank
you
old
fellow
thank
you
for
all
you
have
tried
to
do
perhaps
i
know
the
cost
of
it
to
you
better
than
you
imagine
phil
keir
turned
towards
the
door
but
he
looked
back
ere
he
reached
it
arthur
was
standing
as
he
had
been
motionless
you
not
thinking
of
killing
yourself
are
you
he
said
quietly
arthur
looked
at
him
his
eyes
had
a
different
expression
now
or
was
it
that
something
was
gleaming
softly
in
them
that
had
not
been
there
before
no
no
i
am
not
going
to
be
false
to
my
colours
i
i
do
care
to
talk
much
about
it
but
i
am
a
christian
phil
at
least
i
can
put
that
horrid
idea
out
of
the
poor
child
head
then
thought
keir
to
himself
though
to
arthur
he
did
not
reply
save
by
a
bend
of
his
head
time
passed
and
in
his
wings
there
was
healing
at
daisy
trevannion
though
her
face
bore
traces
of
suffering
of
no
common
order
was
yet
a
sweet
and
serene
woman
to
some
extent
she
had
outlived
the
strange
tragedy
of
her
earlier
girlhood
it
had
never
been
explained
the
one
person
who
might
naturally
have
been
looked
to
to
throw
some
light
on
the
mystery
lingard
sister
lady
west
was
as
her
brother
had
stated
completely
in
the
dark
at
first
she
had
been
disposed
to
blame
daisy
or
her
family
and
though
afterwards
convinced
that
in
so
doing
she
was
entirely
mistaken
she
never
became
in
any
sense
confidential
with
them
on
the
matter
and
after
a
few
months
they
met
no
more
for
her
husband
was
sent
abroad
and
detained
there
on
an
important
diplomatic
mission
now
and
then
in
the
earlier
days
of
her
broken
engagement
daisy
would
ask
philip
to
try
to
find
out
if
mary
west
knows
where
he
is
and
to
please
her
he
did
so
but
all
he
learnt
was
what
indeed
was
all
the
sister
had
to
tell
that
arthur
was
off
again
on
his
old
travels
to
the
capricorn
islands
or
to
the
moon
it
was
not
clear
which
he
has
promised
that
i
shall
hear
from
him
once
a
year
as
near
my
birthday
as
he
can
manage
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
she
said
trying
to
make
light
of
it
and
whether
this
promise
was
kept
or
no
one
thing
was
certain
arthur
lingard
had
entirely
disappeared
from
london
society
at
daisy
married
philip
he
had
always
loved
her
though
he
had
never
allowed
her
to
suspect
it
and
knowing
herself
and
her
history
as
he
did
he
was
satisfied
with
the
true
affection
she
could
give
him
satisfied
that
is
to
say
in
the
hope
and
belief
that
his
own
devotion
would
kindle
response
on
her
side
and
his
hopes
were
not
disappointed
they
were
very
happy
now
for
the
sequel
to
the
story
such
sequel
that
is
to
say
as
there
is
to
give
a
suggestion
of
explanation
rather
than
any
positive
of
the
mystery
they
philip
and
daisy
had
been
married
for
two
or
three
years
when
one
evening
it
chanced
to
them
to
dine
at
the
house
of
a
rather
literary
man
with
whom
they
were
but
slightly
acquainted
they
had
been
invited
for
a
special
reason
their
hosts
were
pleasant
and
genial
people
who
liked
to
get
those
about
them
with
interests
in
common
and
keir
though
his
wings
were
now
so
happily
clipt
still
held
his
position
as
a
traveller
who
had
seen
and
noted
much
in
his
former
wanderings
we
think
your
husband
may
enjoy
a
talk
with
sir
abel
maynard
who
is
with
us
for
a
few
days
thorncroft
had
said
in
her
note
and
sir
abel
not
being
of
the
surly
order
of
lions
who
refuse
to
roar
when
they
know
that
their
audience
is
eager
to
hear
them
made
himself
most
agreeable
he
appreciated
keir
intelligence
and
sympathy
and
was
by
no
means
indifferent
to
keir
beauty
though
evidently
he
thought
to
himself
she
is
not
over
fond
of
reminiscences
of
her
husband
travels
perhaps
she
is
afraid
of
his
taking
flight
again
during
dinner
the
conversation
turned
not
unnaturally
on
a
subject
just
at
that
moment
much
to
the
fore
for
it
was
about
the
time
of
the
heroic
damien
death
no
said
sir
abel
in
answer
to
some
inquiry
i
never
visited
his
place
but
i
have
seen
lepers
to
perfection
he
went
on
suddenly
i
came
across
a
queer
a
very
queer
story
a
while
ago
i
wonder
keir
if
you
can
throw
any
light
upon
it
but
at
that
moment
thorncroft
gave
the
magic
signal
and
the
women
left
the
room
by
degrees
the
men
came
straggling
upstairs
after
them
then
a
little
music
followed
but
it
was
not
till
much
later
in
the
evening
than
was
usual
with
him
that
philip
made
his
appearance
in
the
preceded
by
sir
abel
maynard
philip
looked
tired
and
rather
distrait
thought
daisy
whose
eyes
were
keen
with
the
quick
discernment
of
perfect
affection
and
she
was
not
sorry
when
before
very
long
he
whispered
to
her
that
it
was
getting
late
might
they
not
leave
soon
nor
was
she
sorry
that
during
the
interval
before
her
husband
made
this
suggestion
sir
abel
who
had
been
devoting
himself
to
her
had
avoided
all
mention
of
his
travels
and
had
been
amusing
her
with
his
criticism
of
a
popular
novel
instead
she
could
never
succeed
altogether
in
banishing
the
painful
association
of
arthur
lingard
from
allusion
to
her
husband
old
wanderings
poor
arthur
where
was
he
now
philip
dear
she
said
slipping
her
hand
into
his
when
they
found
themselves
alone
and
with
a
longish
drive
before
them
in
their
own
little
brougham
there
is
something
the
matter
you
have
heard
something
tell
me
what
it
is
keir
hesitated
yes
he
said
i
suppose
it
is
best
to
tell
you
it
is
the
strange
story
sir
abel
alluded
to
before
you
left
the
room
about
about
arthur
is
it
about
arthur
whispered
she
shivering
a
little
philip
put
his
arm
round
her
i
ca
say
we
shall
perhaps
never
know
certainly
he
replied
but
it
looks
very
like
it
listen
dear
some
little
time
ago
two
or
three
years
ago
maynard
spent
some
days
at
one
of
those
awful
leper
settlements
never
mind
where
i
would
just
as
soon
you
did
not
know
there
to
his
amazement
among
the
most
devoted
of
the
attendants
upon
the
poor
creatures
he
found
an
englishman
young
still
at
least
by
his
own
account
though
to
judge
by
his
appearance
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
say
for
he
was
himself
far
gone
very
far
gone
in
some
ways
in
the
disease
but
he
was
or
had
been
a
man
of
strong
constitution
and
enormous
determination
ill
as
he
was
he
yet
managed
to
tend
others
with
indescribable
devotion
they
looked
upon
him
as
a
saint
maynard
did
not
like
to
inquire
what
had
brought
him
to
such
a
pass
he
the
poor
fellow
was
a
perfect
gentleman
but
the
day
sir
abel
was
leaving
the
englishman
took
him
to
some
extent
into
his
confidence
and
asked
him
to
do
him
a
service
this
was
his
story
some
years
before
in
quite
a
different
part
of
the
world
the
young
man
had
nursed
a
leper
a
dying
leper
for
some
hours
he
believed
for
long
that
he
had
escaped
all
danger
in
fact
he
never
thought
of
it
but
it
was
not
so
there
must
have
been
an
unhealed
wound
of
some
kind
a
slight
scratch
would
do
it
on
his
hand
no
need
to
go
into
the
details
of
his
first
misgivings
of
the
horror
of
the
awful
certainty
at
last
it
came
upon
him
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
happiness
he
was
going
to
be
married
to
a
girl
he
adored
oh
philip
philip
why
did
he
not
tell
daisy
wailed
he
consulted
the
best
and
greatest
physician
who
as
a
friend
he
said
approved
of
the
course
he
had
mapped
out
for
himself
he
decided
to
tell
no
one
to
break
off
his
engagement
and
die
out
of
her
the
girl
life
not
once
after
he
was
sure
did
he
see
her
again
he
would
not
even
risk
touching
her
hand
and
he
believed
that
telling
would
only
have
brought
worse
agony
upon
her
in
the
end
than
the
agony
he
was
forced
to
inflict
for
he
was
a
doomed
man
though
they
gave
him
a
few
years
to
live
and
he
did
the
only
thing
he
could
do
with
those
years
he
set
off
to
the
settlement
in
question
maynard
was
to
call
there
some
months
later
on
his
way
home
and
the
young
man
knew
he
would
be
dead
then
and
so
he
was
but
he
showed
maynard
a
letter
explaining
all
that
he
had
got
ready
all
but
the
address
he
would
not
add
till
he
was
in
the
act
of
dying
there
must
be
no
risk
of
her
knowing
till
he
was
dead
and
this
letter
maynard
was
to
fetch
on
his
return
he
did
so
but
there
had
been
no
time
to
add
the
address
death
had
come
suddenly
all
sorts
of
precautions
had
been
ordered
by
the
poor
fellow
as
to
disinfecting
the
letter
and
so
on
but
it
did
not
seem
to
maynard
that
these
had
been
taken
so
he
contented
himself
by
spreading
out
the
paper
on
the
and
learning
it
by
heart
and
then
leaving
it
the
sum
total
of
it
was
what
i
have
told
you
but
not
one
name
was
named
daisy
was
sobbing
quietly
was
it
he
she
said
yes
i
feel
sure
of
it
philip
replied
for
i
can
supply
the
missing
link
the
one
time
i
really
quarrelled
with
arthur
was
when
we
were
in
siberia
he
spend
a
night
in
a
dying
leper
hut
i
would
have
done
it
myself
i
believe
and
hope
had
it
been
necessary
but
by
riding
on
a
few
miles
we
could
have
got
help
for
the
poor
creature
which
indeed
i
did
and
more
efficient
help
than
ours
but
lingard
was
determined
and
no
ill
seemed
to
come
of
it
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
circumstance
i
never
associated
it
with
the
mystery
that
caused
you
such
anguish
my
poor
darling
it
was
he
whispered
daisy
philip
he
was
a
hero
after
all
not
even
you
can
feel
that
as
i
do
keir
replied
then
they
were
silent
a
few
weeks
afterwards
came
a
letter
from
lady
west
in
her
south
american
home
daisy
had
not
heard
from
her
for
years
by
circuitous
ways
i
need
not
explain
the
details
she
wrote
i
have
learnt
that
my
darling
brother
is
dead
i
thought
i
had
better
tell
you
i
am
sure
his
most
earnest
wish
was
that
you
should
live
to
be
happy
dear
daisy
as
i
trust
you
are
and
i
know
you
have
long
forgiven
him
the
sorrow
he
caused
you
it
was
worse
still
for
him
i
wonder
said
daisy
if
she
knows
more
but
the
letter
seemed
to
add
certainty
to
their
own
conviction
the
clock
that
struck
thirteen
you
misunderstand
me
wilfully
helen
i
neither
said
nor
inferred
anything
of
the
kind
what
did
you
mean
then
for
if
words
to
you
bear
a
different
interpretation
from
what
they
do
to
me
i
must
trouble
you
to
speak
in
language
when
addressing
me
angrily
retorted
a
young
girl
with
what
nature
had
intended
to
be
a
very
pretty
face
with
a
charming
expression
but
which
at
the
present
moment
was
far
from
deserving
the
latter
part
of
the
description
eyes
flashing
cheeks
burning
and
hands
clenched
in
the
excess
of
her
indignation
stood
helen
beaumont
by
the
window
of
her
pretty
little
or
studio
as
she
loved
to
call
it
presenting
a
striking
contrast
to
the
peaceful
scene
without
where
a
carefully
tended
garden
still
looked
bright
with
the
remaining
flowers
of
late
september
her
companion
standing
in
the
attitude
invariably
assumed
by
novelists
heroes
namely
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
was
a
young
man
of
equally
prepossessing
appearance
with
her
own
at
first
glance
no
one
would
have
suspected
him
of
sharing
any
of
the
young
lady
excitement
for
his
expression
was
so
calm
as
almost
to
merit
the
description
of
sleepy
looking
more
closely
however
the
signs
of
some
unusual
disturbance
or
annoyance
were
to
be
descried
for
his
face
was
slightly
flushed
and
his
blue
eyes
had
lost
the
look
of
sweet
temper
evidently
their
ordinary
expression
what
i
meant
to
say
helen
was
not
as
you
choose
to
misinterpret
it
that
i
blame
you
for
proper
womanly
courage
and
spirit
than
which
i
consider
few
things
more
admirable
nor
as
you
are
well
aware
do
i
admire
the
sweetly
silly
and
affectedly
timid
order
of
young
ladies
but
this
i
do
mean
and
repeat
that
i
think
your
persistence
in
this
foolish
scheme
a
piece
of
sheer
bravado
and
foolhardiness
totally
unworthy
of
any
sensible
person
approval
and
what
is
more
thank
you
malcolm
or
rather
willoughby
i
have
heard
quite
enough
and
as
she
spoke
helen
turned
from
the
window
out
of
which
she
had
been
gazing
while
malcolm
spoke
with
it
must
be
confessed
very
little
interest
in
the
varied
tints
of
the
dahlias
blooming
in
all
their
rich
brilliance
on
the
terrace
i
have
heard
quite
enough
and
think
myself
exceedingly
fortunate
in
having
heard
it
now
before
it
is
too
late
you
may
imagine
she
continued
that
i
am
speaking
in
temper
but
it
is
not
so
i
have
for
some
time
suspected
and
now
feel
convinced
that
we
are
not
suited
to
each
other
your
own
words
bear
witness
to
your
opinion
of
me
foolhardy
unwomanly
and
i
know
not
what
other
pretty
expressions
you
have
applied
to
me
and
for
my
part
i
tell
you
simply
that
i
can
not
and
will
not
marry
a
man
whose
opinion
of
what
a
woman
should
be
is
like
yours
and
who
insults
me
constantly
as
you
do
by
telling
me
how
far
short
i
fall
of
his
ideal
marry
your
ideal
malcolm
willoughby
and
i
shall
wish
you
joy
of
her
some
silly
little
fool
who
dares
not
move
a
step
alone
in
her
bewitching
helplessness
but
do
not
think
to
convert
into
such
a
piece
of
contemptible
inanity
and
so
saying
she
turned
towards
the
door
helen
said
malcolm
quietly
so
quietly
that
helen
was
arrested
in
spite
of
herself
you
are
unjust
unreasonable
and
ungenerous
you
know
that
i
never
cared
for
any
woman
but
you
you
know
that
nothing
pleases
me
more
than
to
witness
your
superiority
in
numberless
particulars
to
the
general
run
of
girls
and
you
know
too
the
pride
and
pleasure
i
take
in
your
skill
as
an
artist
but
blinded
by
you
will
not
see
the
perfect
reasonableness
of
my
request
that
you
will
abandon
this
absurd
expedition
if
not
for
your
own
sake
at
least
do
so
for
edith
who
is
as
you
know
left
in
your
special
charge
by
leonard
the
first
part
of
this
speech
seemed
to
judge
by
helen
transparent
countenance
likely
to
soften
and
move
her
but
the
unlucky
word
absurd
and
the
tone
in
which
malcolm
spoke
as
if
it
was
necessary
to
remind
her
of
her
duty
effectually
did
away
with
any
good
result
that
his
remonstrance
might
have
worked
she
turned
with
her
hand
on
the
door
and
saying
i
have
told
you
my
decision
willoughby
and
i
wish
you
left
the
room
malcolm
remained
behind
lost
in
thought
of
no
pleasurable
nature
at
last
he
too
left
the
little
after
first
ringing
the
bell
and
ordering
his
horse
to
be
brought
round
making
his
way
to
the
front
entrance
he
there
mounted
and
rode
away
his
spirits
poor
fellow
by
no
means
the
better
for
his
visit
it
is
time
i
think
to
explain
the
cause
of
the
lovers
quarrel
above
described
helen
and
edith
beaumont
were
orphans
left
to
the
guardianship
of
their
brother
leonard
in
whose
house
we
have
seen
the
former
delicacy
induced
by
a
severe
illness
some
months
previously
had
obliged
beaumont
accompanied
by
his
wife
to
go
for
the
autumn
and
winter
months
to
the
south
of
france
leaving
his
sisters
at
home
under
the
nominal
chaperonage
of
an
elderly
aunt
who
performed
her
duty
to
the
perfect
satisfaction
of
her
nieces
by
letting
them
do
exactly
as
they
liked
more
correctly
speaking
perhaps
exactly
as
helen
liked
for
the
younger
of
the
two
edith
a
girl
of
seventeen
and
four
years
her
sister
junior
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
likes
or
dislikes
distinct
from
those
of
helen
possibly
beaumont
might
not
have
left
the
two
to
their
own
devices
with
so
easy
a
mind
had
he
not
quitted
home
happy
in
the
knowledge
of
helen
engagement
to
his
friend
and
neighbour
malcolm
willoughby
the
gentleman
in
question
lived
within
a
few
miles
of
our
heroine
home
having
succeeded
some
years
before
to
his
father
property
his
only
sister
lindsay
was
at
this
time
living
with
him
for
a
few
months
while
awaiting
her
husband
return
from
india
and
though
some
years
older
was
next
to
her
sister
helen
most
valued
friend
and
companion
malcolm
willoughby
was
a
man
of
high
character
peculiarly
fitted
by
his
unusual
amount
of
sterling
good
sense
to
be
the
guide
of
an
impulsive
enthusiastic
girl
like
pretty
helen
beaumont
whom
to
know
was
to
love
and
who
would
have
been
altogether
charming
but
for
her
inordinate
amount
of
and
inveterate
dislike
to
being
as
she
expressed
it
ordered
to
do
or
not
to
do
whatever
came
into
her
head
she
and
her
sister
had
real
talent
as
artists
and
their
spirited
and
landscapes
bore
but
little
resemblance
to
the
insipid
productions
of
most
young
lady
painters
to
improving
herself
in
this
direction
helen
had
devoted
much
time
and
labour
unfortunately
it
had
so
absorbed
her
thoughts
and
desires
that
in
its
pursuance
she
was
inclined
sometimes
to
forget
what
were
for
her
more
important
avocations
helen
fortunate
engagement
to
willoughby
had
for
some
time
past
corrected
these
only
objectionable
tendencies
in
her
character
and
all
had
gone
smoothly
and
happily
till
the
date
at
which
our
story
commences
when
unluckily
some
artist
friends
had
filled
her
head
with
their
descriptions
of
the
exquisite
autumn
scenery
effects
of
foliage
to
be
seen
in
a
mountainous
and
hitherto
little
explored
part
of
wales
her
imagination
and
through
her
that
of
her
sister
edith
ran
wild
on
the
subject
and
now
nothing
would
satisfy
her
but
a
journey
to
the
spot
in
question
by
themselves
in
order
that
they
might
enjoy
their
freedom
to
the
utmost
and
revel
in
the
delight
of
painting
some
of
the
wonderful
welsh
scenery
described
to
them
the
idea
had
at
first
been
mooted
half
in
joke
but
an
impolitic
expression
of
strong
disapprobation
on
the
part
of
willoughby
had
done
more
to
determine
helen
on
carrying
it
out
than
all
the
anticipated
artistic
enjoyment
it
will
be
just
the
opportunity
i
wanted
thought
the
foolish
girl
of
showing
him
that
i
do
not
intend
to
be
a
silly
nonentity
of
a
wife
with
no
opinion
of
my
own
and
hedged
in
by
all
the
absurd
conventionalities
which
will
not
allow
a
woman
to
have
an
existence
of
her
own
or
give
her
opportunity
to
cultivate
what
talents
she
may
possess
and
once
determined
miss
helen
remained
inflexible
in
vain
willoughby
remonstrated
in
vain
even
their
indulgent
old
aunt
expressed
her
horror
at
the
idea
of
two
young
girls
scouring
the
country
by
themselves
her
own
feebleness
rendering
her
accompanying
them
out
of
the
question
go
to
wales
helen
and
edith
must
and
go
they
would
till
at
last
the
discussion
with
her
terminated
in
the
disastrous
manner
above
recorded
i
will
not
undertake
to
describe
helen
feelings
when
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
room
she
thought
over
what
she
had
done
had
she
herself
been
obliged
to
put
them
into
words
i
believe
she
would
have
repeated
that
she
had
not
acted
in
temper
and
that
the
stand
she
had
made
for
her
womanly
freedom
as
she
would
have
expressed
it
had
been
an
act
of
supreme
heroism
and
devotion
to
the
cause
of
right
she
said
all
this
to
herself
and
tried
hard
very
hard
to
believe
it
and
to
stifle
the
little
voice
at
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
which
whispered
that
she
had
behaved
like
a
silly
petted
child
and
shown
herself
undeserving
of
so
good
a
gift
as
the
love
of
a
man
like
malcolm
willoughby
the
little
voice
was
smothered
for
the
time
by
exaggerated
anticipations
of
the
delights
of
their
tour
and
attempted
at
her
newly
regained
liberty
to
do
as
she
chose
for
malcolm
did
not
come
near
her
again
and
it
took
all
her
pride
to
hide
from
herself
and
others
the
shock
she
felt
through
all
her
being
when
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
she
heard
accidentally
that
willoughby
was
leaving
home
for
an
uncertain
length
of
time
he
has
taken
me
at
my
word
thought
she
but
of
course
i
meant
him
to
do
so
and
she
hurried
on
the
preparations
for
their
journey
which
they
were
now
on
the
eve
of
you
will
at
least
take
maxwell
said
aunt
fanny
timidly
maxwell
aunt
no
thank
you
said
helen
ironically
she
would
be
crying
for
her
spring
mattress
the
first
night
and
thinking
she
was
going
to
die
if
she
heard
the
wind
howl
no
thank
you
i
mean
to
be
independent
for
once
in
my
life
and
so
does
edith
other
hours
saw
our
two
young
ladies
on
their
way
unaccustomed
as
they
were
to
travelling
alone
they
got
on
very
well
for
the
greater
part
of
their
journey
till
they
arrived
at
a
certain
railway
station
in
wales
of
name
unpronounceable
by
civilised
tongue
but
which
sounded
to
them
like
that
of
the
place
where
they
were
to
leave
the
railway
never
doubting
but
what
they
were
right
in
so
doing
helen
and
edith
calmly
descended
from
their
carriage
watched
the
train
disappear
in
the
tunnel
hard
by
and
then
began
to
make
inquiries
for
a
conveyance
to
transport
themselves
and
their
luggage
white
umbrellas
easels
and
all
the
five
or
six
miles
which
they
imagined
were
all
that
divided
them
from
their
destination
a
colloquy
ensued
with
the
most
intelligible
of
two
or
three
carmen
or
whatever
these
personages
are
called
in
wales
but
what
was
helen
consternation
on
learning
that
fifteen
miles
at
least
remained
to
be
traversed
they
having
left
the
railway
at
llanfar
two
stations
too
soon
instead
of
remaining
in
it
till
they
reached
llanfair
the
point
nearest
to
the
where
lodgings
had
been
taken
for
them
no
chance
of
a
train
to
llanfair
till
morning
for
the
line
was
a
new
one
and
the
traffic
as
yet
but
small
no
prospect
of
a
night
accommodation
where
they
were
nothing
for
it
but
to
trust
to
the
driver
assurance
that
he
and
his
horse
could
easily
convey
them
to
the
with
the
inevitably
unpronounceable
name
with
some
unconfessed
misgivings
helen
and
edith
mounted
the
vehicle
awaiting
them
and
drove
off
along
a
muddy
jolting
lane
into
the
quickly
gathering
gloom
shivering
on
her
uncomfortable
seat
did
helen
wish
herself
at
home
again
in
her
own
little
with
aunt
fanny
peacefully
knitting
edith
kneeling
on
the
and
malcolm
face
bright
with
the
reflection
of
the
ruddy
log
fire
so
welcome
in
autumn
evenings
all
together
as
was
their
wont
enjoying
blind
man
holiday
i
think
we
had
better
not
press
the
question
too
closely
however
a
long
lane
that
has
no
ending
and
even
this
dreary
journey
gradually
drew
to
a
close
they
passed
but
few
houses
of
any
kind
one
or
two
straggling
hamlets
were
left
behind
and
for
some
two
or
three
miles
the
road
had
been
perfectly
solitary
when
they
suddenly
heard
wheels
advancing
to
meet
them
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
car
like
their
own
drove
towards
them
and
being
hailed
by
their
driver
drew
up
at
their
side
a
jabbering
ensued
of
directions
asked
and
given
and
they
again
drove
on
are
you
sure
you
know
the
way
said
helen
timidly
oh
yes
miss
the
driver
answered
confidently
and
further
informed
them
that
the
car
they
had
met
had
just
returned
from
their
own
destination
being
translated
the
black
nest
farm
having
there
deposited
a
traveller
who
had
taken
the
middle
course
of
leaving
the
railway
at
the
intermediate
stoppage
between
llanfar
and
llanfair
other
of
an
hour
and
they
pulled
up
at
last
before
a
house
which
the
darkness
prevented
their
seeing
more
of
than
that
it
was
long
and
low
they
stumbled
up
the
rough
garden
path
and
in
answer
to
their
knock
the
door
was
opened
by
a
tidy
old
woman
with
a
flickering
candle
in
her
hand
evidently
surprised
at
their
appearance
she
had
she
said
quite
given
up
thoughts
of
their
coming
that
night
and
feared
the
fire
in
the
was
out
thankful
to
have
reached
the
black
nest
at
last
a
chilly
room
seemed
a
smaller
evil
than
the
two
girls
would
have
considered
it
at
home
and
after
all
things
were
not
so
bad
for
the
fire
in
the
little
farmhouse
parlour
to
which
their
landlady
conducted
them
was
not
quite
out
and
a
little
judicious
coaxing
soon
brought
it
round
their
hostess
and
their
own
first
idea
was
of
course
what
a
blessing
by
the
way
it
is
that
british
womankind
in
general
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
old
and
young
have
this
taste
in
common
refreshed
by
the
homely
meal
speedily
set
before
them
helen
and
edith
proceeded
under
the
guidance
of
the
old
woman
apparently
the
only
inhabitant
of
the
house
and
the
flickering
candle
to
inspect
their
sleeping
apartment
the
result
was
not
eminently
satisfactory
for
it
struck
them
as
gloomy
and
a
long
way
from
their
parlour
though
but
few
rooms
appeared
to
intervene
between
the
two
this
puzzled
them
at
the
time
but
was
afterwards
explained
by
the
fact
that
black
nest
had
originally
consisted
of
two
cottages
standing
at
some
yards
distance
from
each
other
and
which
on
becoming
the
property
of
one
owner
had
been
united
by
a
long
passage
which
arrangement
was
looked
upon
in
the
neighbourhood
as
a
triumph
of
architectural
ingenuity
on
returning
to
their
helen
eye
fell
on
a
door
beside
their
own
which
she
had
not
before
noticed
and
she
inquired
if
that
was
a
bedroom
to
which
the
old
woman
replied
in
the
affirmative
but
added
that
they
could
not
have
it
as
it
and
a
small
opening
out
of
it
were
engaged
by
a
strange
gentleman
and
besides
this
she
added
the
bedroom
was
not
so
desirable
for
ladies
having
a
second
or
rather
third
door
to
the
outside
of
the
house
the
only
other
room
they
could
have
was
so
small
that
she
did
not
think
they
would
like
it
but
they
should
see
for
themselves
and
so
saying
she
turned
towards
a
recess
in
the
passage
helen
followed
her
but
the
flickering
candle
suddenly
throwing
light
in
a
new
direction
she
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
alarm
at
what
appeared
at
the
first
moment
to
be
a
very
ugly
grinning
portrait
high
up
on
the
wall
it
only
the
clock
miss
said
the
old
woman
though
to
be
sure
it
is
quare
and
as
she
spoke
she
threw
the
light
more
fully
upon
the
object
that
had
startled
helen
which
she
now
perceived
to
be
a
very
antique
clock
standing
high
in
a
dark
wooden
case
and
with
the
face
she
had
seen
peeping
at
you
as
it
were
from
behind
the
an
ugly
coarsely
painted
face
with
a
disagreeably
mocking
expression
it
seemed
to
helen
nor
was
it
the
only
repulsive
feature
in
this
very
remarkable
clock
for
the
artist
appeared
to
have
outdone
himself
in
the
grotesquely
hideous
devices
at
the
bottom
of
the
dial
death
heads
and
other
equally
unpleasant
objects
of
various
kinds
curiously
intermingled
with
a
condensed
solar
system
in
which
sun
moon
and
stars
appeared
jumbled
together
haphazard
the
general
object
of
the
whole
evidently
being
to
bring
before
the
spectator
the
ghastly
side
of
his
future
and
to
read
him
a
wholesome
but
certainly
not
attractive
homily
on
the
shortness
of
life
and
the
speed
with
which
time
was
ticking
away
helen
felt
half
fascinated
by
its
hideousness
dear
me
what
a
very
curious
clock
she
ejaculated
and
the
old
woman
repeated
with
a
little
inward
chuckle
at
what
she
evidently
considered
the
admiration
drawn
forth
by
her
heirloom
yes
sure
it
quare
an
uncanny
object
it
certainly
was
and
helen
felt
relieved
that
the
room
in
its
immediate
vicinity
was
so
small
as
to
be
out
of
the
question
for
the
accommodation
of
her
sister
and
herself
the
she
found
poor
edith
looking
so
utterly
that
she
proposed
that
they
should
at
once
go
to
bed
which
they
accordingly
did
followed
by
the
old
woman
with
offers
of
assistance
passing
the
door
of
the
strange
gentleman
room
they
heard
sounds
of
some
one
moving
inside
and
edith
sleepily
remarked
that
she
wondered
what
could
have
brought
a
gentleman
to
an
outlandish
place
like
the
black
nest
unless
like
themselves
he
came
to
take
views
in
the
neighbourhood
helen
pricked
up
her
ears
at
this
and
inquired
of
jones
if
their
was
an
artist
jones
thought
not
but
seemed
unwilling
to
pursue
the
topic
of
the
strange
gentleman
further
in
rather
a
forced
manner
she
changed
the
subject
by
inquiring
if
the
young
ladies
would
like
to
hire
her
pony
while
there
as
it
was
rough
walking
and
her
grandson
griffith
the
only
other
inhabitant
of
the
cottage
a
little
lad
of
twelve
could
lead
it
for
them
and
show
them
the
way
whenever
they
chose
helen
gladly
closed
with
the
offer
dear
me
jones
she
exclaimed
how
very
lonely
you
must
be
living
here
with
no
one
but
a
little
boy
have
you
no
near
neighbours
none
nearer
than
three
miles
for
the
live
at
a
distance
save
old
thomas
in
the
last
cottage
you
passed
but
he
is
my
widow
daughter
griffith
mother
was
with
me
till
she
took
ill
two
winters
ago
and
died
before
the
doctor
could
get
to
her
yes
it
is
lonesome
like
in
winter
to
be
sure
it
not
often
that
gentry
like
you
miss
care
to
be
in
these
parts
so
late
in
the
year
further
inquiries
elicited
that
the
nearest
church
was
a
good
five
miles
off
that
there
was
no
doctor
nearer
than
llanfar
that
the
butcher
only
came
in
the
winter
once
a
fortnight
and
that
irregularly
in
consequence
of
which
the
black
nesters
had
often
to
depend
upon
their
own
scanty
resources
the
roads
being
almost
impassable
in
stormy
weather
do
you
think
it
feels
rather
dreary
helen
said
edith
as
she
was
falling
asleep
rather
i
should
say
replied
her
sister
but
that
you
know
is
the
beauty
of
it
in
the
morning
i
daresay
it
will
look
bright
enough
but
i
confess
i
do
not
like
that
clock
listen
you
hear
its
ticking
faintly
even
here
at
the
end
of
that
long
passage
what
clock
do
you
mean
i
saw
no
clock
said
edith
but
almost
before
helen
could
answer
her
soft
regular
breathing
told
that
she
was
asleep
helen
however
could
not
so
quickly
compose
herself
she
felt
excited
and
vaguely
uneasy
and
when
she
at
last
fell
asleep
it
was
only
to
have
her
discomfort
increased
by
absurd
yet
alarming
dreams
with
them
all
the
ugly
clock
was
grotesquely
intermingled
sometimes
it
was
herself
sometimes
edith
and
once
malcolm
whom
she
fancied
in
some
position
of
terrible
peril
always
associated
with
the
clock
and
at
last
she
awoke
with
a
scream
of
horror
at
the
most
frightful
dream
of
all
in
which
the
strange
gentleman
their
was
pursuing
her
with
a
veil
over
his
face
which
just
as
he
caught
her
fell
off
and
disclosed
horrible
to
relate
the
face
on
the
clock
edith
started
up
as
helen
convulsively
clutched
her
and
exclaiming
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
really
thought
helen
was
going
out
of
her
mind
when
she
replied
that
horrible
clock
and
as
she
spoke
as
if
invoked
the
clock
began
to
strike
one
two
three
four
and
so
on
is
it
never
going
to
stop
said
helen
poor
edith
half
asleep
still
listened
with
her
edith
i
am
almost
certain
that
clock
struck
said
helen
in
an
voice
and
then
they
heard
a
door
shut
at
the
end
of
the
passage
helen
you
have
been
dreaming
and
you
are
only
half
awake
now
said
edith
it
is
not
like
you
to
waken
me
in
this
frightening
way
please
let
me
go
to
sleep
i
am
very
sorry
said
helen
penitently
and
she
too
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
hard
to
go
to
sleep
which
of
course
she
did
as
soon
as
she
left
off
trying
and
had
made
up
her
mind
to
lie
awake
till
daylight
the
morning
broke
clear
and
fresh
and
as
helen
had
said
things
in
general
bore
a
very
different
aspect
to
that
of
the
night
before
indoors
the
quaint
old
house
now
looked
simply
picturesque
and
jones
the
of
a
cheery
old
hostess
even
the
face
of
the
clock
when
helen
pointed
it
out
to
edith
seemed
to
have
lost
its
mocking
grin
and
to
be
merely
bidding
them
with
a
comical
smile
at
the
consternation
it
had
awakened
the
night
before
they
soon
turned
their
steps
there
was
no
view
from
the
house
but
a
short
voyage
of
discovery
quickly
explained
to
them
their
locality
black
nest
farm
stood
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
close
on
to
the
high
road
or
what
passed
for
such
in
that
hitherto
little
frequented
neighbourhood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
but
little
was
to
be
seen
as
the
meadows
were
soon
lost
in
a
thick
belt
of
wood
but
immediately
behind
the
house
was
a
tempting
prospect
for
there
a
little
winding
path
led
up
the
hill
to
one
of
the
spots
helen
and
edith
most
ardently
desired
to
paint
and
of
which
their
friends
had
given
them
a
glowing
description
it
was
rather
a
long
walk
to
the
black
lake
jones
informed
them
but
their
enthusiasm
knew
no
bounds
and
hardly
permitted
them
to
do
justice
to
their
breakfast
of
ham
and
eggs
bread
and
butter
see
them
then
starting
on
their
expedition
their
painting
materials
and
some
creature
comforts
in
the
shape
of
sandwiches
and
eggs
safely
packed
on
the
back
griffith
leading
him
and
acting
as
guide
a
pretty
stiff
pull
it
was
enthusiasm
notwithstanding
and
rather
hard
work
for
the
little
feet
sensibly
shod
in
good
strong
boots
it
is
true
but
unaccustomed
nevertheless
to
mountain
scrambling
but
at
last
their
circuitous
path
brought
them
to
the
summit
and
there
a
curious
prospect
broke
upon
them
they
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
great
welsh
tableland
there
it
stretched
away
before
them
miles
and
miles
beyond
their
view
a
vast
expanse
of
wild
brown
moor
unrelieved
by
tree
or
shrub
but
here
and
there
dotted
by
great
patches
of
what
edith
at
first
sight
took
to
be
lovely
emerald
moss
treacherous
loveliness
for
it
told
as
they
learnt
from
griffith
of
fearful
down
whose
slimy
sides
once
slipped
no
man
or
beast
could
ever
regain
firm
ground
what
a
horrible
death
that
would
be
said
helen
shuddering
far
worse
than
regular
drowning
in
clean
water
it
would
be
slow
suffocation
in
nasty
dirty
mud
a
few
minutes
careful
walking
brought
them
in
sight
of
the
black
lake
the
special
object
of
their
excursion
and
it
certainly
was
well
worth
coming
to
see
if
not
to
paint
probably
too
better
seen
in
the
greyness
of
a
late
autumn
day
than
in
the
summer
sun
whose
bright
rays
reflected
on
its
surface
would
have
little
harmonised
with
its
character
of
gloom
and
loneliness
the
lake
was
equal
to
several
acres
in
extent
but
from
where
they
stood
could
not
all
be
seen
as
its
farther
end
was
hidden
by
the
undulations
of
the
land
in
colour
it
was
a
dull
leaden
grey
and
looking
at
it
one
mind
spontaneously
reverted
to
travellers
descriptions
of
the
dead
sea
for
was
essentially
the
word
by
which
to
describe
it
there
were
no
fish
to
be
caught
in
it
griffith
told
them
and
as
for
its
depth
he
had
never
heard
tell
of
any
one
sounding
it
the
effect
of
the
whole
scene
was
very
peculiar
and
so
helen
and
edith
felt
it
to
be
as
they
stood
gazing
at
the
leaden
water
and
the
great
apparently
boundless
moorland
it
was
difficult
to
realise
that
they
were
so
far
above
the
ordinary
haunts
of
men
for
there
was
nothing
in
that
great
plain
to
remind
them
of
the
existence
even
of
hills
and
mountains
except
a
breeze
of
that
peculiar
freshness
pertaining
only
to
sea
or
mountain
air
pleasantly
invigorating
at
first
but
soon
becoming
too
chilly
to
make
one
care
to
stand
about
or
worse
still
to
as
our
young
ladies
now
prepared
to
do
we
are
very
lucky
in
the
weather
remarked
helen
as
they
prepared
for
their
sketching
i
should
fancy
it
is
just
the
day
to
see
the
lake
to
the
best
advantage
or
disadvantage
said
edith
for
i
do
think
it
is
the
most
horrible
place
i
ever
saw
i
do
know
added
she
dreamily
but
what
it
would
seem
even
more
desolate
on
a
bright
sunny
day
i
do
know
why
i
understand
how
you
mean
replied
her
sister
the
contrast
would
be
so
strange
like
a
skeleton
dressed
in
a
golden
robe
dear
me
i
am
becoming
quite
poetical
but
look
edith
how
do
you
like
this
and
a
consultation
on
their
work
ensued
very
cold
work
it
became
as
it
grew
to
afternoon
notwithstanding
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
their
occupation
and
edith
for
one
was
not
sorry
when
helen
at
last
thought
it
time
to
pack
up
their
painting
materials
and
turn
homewards
a
drizzling
rain
began
to
fall
as
they
neared
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
they
both
felt
thankful
to
reach
the
tired
muddy
and
damp
and
in
not
such
high
spirits
as
when
they
set
off
on
their
expedition
a
savoury
odour
meeting
them
on
their
entrance
helen
suddenly
bethought
herself
that
she
had
utterly
forgotten
to
order
anything
for
their
high
tea
or
whatever
one
likes
to
call
the
said
incongruous
meal
it
was
therefore
an
agreeable
surprise
to
her
after
remembering
her
neglect
to
see
on
entering
their
little
the
brightest
of
fires
and
the
table
daintily
set
out
with
evident
preparation
for
a
tempting
repast
part
of
which
in
the
shape
of
a
ham
a
pat
of
butter
and
a
wheaten
loaf
so
fine
had
already
made
its
appearance
damp
clothes
and
muddy
boots
discarded
they
sat
down
with
an
excellent
appetite
to
their
meal
and
the
savoury
odour
which
had
greeted
them
was
soon
explained
by
the
appearance
of
jones
bearing
a
chicken
stewed
in
mushrooms
mushrooms
exclaimed
helen
the
thing
of
all
others
i
like
how
clever
you
are
jones
to
get
us
all
these
good
things
i
shall
leave
our
food
to
your
providing
i
think
in
future
jones
laughed
and
said
a
friend
had
sent
some
things
from
llanfar
and
a
friend
also
had
gathered
the
mushrooms
the
last
of
their
season
thinking
the
young
ladies
might
like
them
your
friends
are
as
good
as
yourself
then
jones
said
helen
but
as
she
spoke
she
was
startled
by
what
sounded
like
a
laugh
or
exclamation
of
some
kind
just
outside
the
door
almost
at
the
same
moment
her
friend
the
clock
began
to
strike
and
she
therefore
fancied
the
sound
she
had
heard
must
have
come
from
it
its
internal
arrangements
are
i
daresay
as
peculiar
as
its
outside
thought
she
to
herself
and
refrained
therefore
from
mentioning
to
edith
what
she
thought
she
had
heard
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
however
though
she
would
hardly
have
owned
it
to
herself
she
felt
a
little
nervous
and
uneasy
particularly
when
she
heard
the
clock
strike
i
wonder
what
our
does
with
himself
all
day
said
edith
that
evening
i
am
sure
i
do
know
or
care
either
said
helen
indeed
i
hardly
believe
there
is
such
a
being
at
all
they
went
early
to
bed
and
fell
quickly
asleep
after
having
slept
it
seemed
to
her
for
several
hours
helen
woke
suddenly
with
the
feeling
that
something
had
wakened
her
and
found
that
the
clock
was
busy
striking
and
to
her
confused
fancy
had
been
striking
for
ever
so
long
before
she
woke
its
strokes
ceased
before
she
was
sufficiently
awake
to
count
them
but
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
she
heard
a
door
shut
as
it
had
done
the
night
before
it
is
very
annoying
that
i
ca
get
a
good
night
rest
here
thought
she
a
whispered
helen
told
her
that
edith
too
was
awake
the
clock
strike
thirteen
said
edith
and
there
be
somebody
in
that
room
for
i
heard
the
door
shut
again
and
so
did
i
said
helen
whereupon
they
lay
still
in
silence
till
they
both
fell
fast
asleep
again
the
next
day
was
saturday
and
though
somewhat
stiff
and
tired
with
their
exertions
friday
programme
was
repeated
the
sketches
proceeded
satisfactorily
but
our
heroines
were
less
fortunate
in
other
respects
for
just
as
they
were
about
to
leave
the
black
lake
in
the
afternoon
the
rain
came
on
in
torrents
long
before
they
got
back
to
the
the
poor
girls
were
thoroughly
drenched
edith
escaped
with
no
ill
results
but
helen
sat
shivering
over
the
fire
all
the
evening
passed
an
uneasy
night
in
which
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
clock
never
left
off
striking
at
all
and
woke
on
sunday
morning
with
every
symptom
of
a
delightfully
bad
cold
the
prospect
outside
was
not
cheering
rain
rain
rain
down
it
came
in
torrents
no
chance
of
making
their
way
to
the
five
miles
off
church
no
chance
even
of
a
quiet
stroll
along
the
lanes
and
worst
of
all
no
books
to
read
for
such
a
possibility
as
a
whole
day
in
the
house
had
never
presented
itself
to
their
inexperienced
imaginations
it
was
very
dull
helen
was
almost
cross
with
edith
for
being
so
exceedingly
sympathetic
it
was
kind
of
course
but
provoking
nevertheless
as
to
helen
sensitiveness
it
seemed
to
convey
a
tacit
reproach
she
would
not
allow
to
herself
that
they
were
at
all
to
be
pitied
all
the
same
she
was
not
sorry
when
the
time
came
at
last
for
them
to
go
to
bed
i
wish
we
had
brought
some
sherry
with
us
said
edith
a
little
white
wine
whey
would
have
been
the
very
thing
for
your
cold
what
the
good
of
wishing
replied
her
sister
rather
snappishly
you
had
better
call
jones
and
ask
her
to
make
me
some
gruel
but
on
jones
appearance
and
when
the
request
had
been
made
both
the
girls
felt
rather
surprised
at
her
volunteering
the
very
thing
they
had
been
wishing
for
she
had
she
said
some
very
nice
sherry
wine
given
her
by
a
friend
and
many
years
ago
when
she
was
in
service
in
chester
she
had
learnt
to
make
white
wine
whey
sure
enough
a
basinful
shortly
after
made
its
appearance
thanks
to
its
soporific
influence
helen
soon
fell
asleep
but
woke
as
she
had
got
strangely
into
the
habit
of
doing
just
at
midnight
or
as
edith
had
taken
to
calling
it
thirteen
the
clock
was
through
its
striking
when
she
woke
and
a
sudden
impulse
seized
her
to
jump
up
and
opening
the
door
slightly
to
peep
out
and
either
see
who
it
was
that
always
shut
a
door
after
the
clock
struck
or
by
seeing
nothing
satisfy
herself
that
the
sound
had
all
along
been
merely
the
creation
of
her
own
and
edith
imagination
she
opened
the
door
very
cautiously
and
instantly
perceived
that
there
was
a
light
at
the
end
of
the
passage
in
the
recess
where
stood
the
clock
helen
heart
beat
more
loudly
and
she
wished
devoutly
that
she
had
allowed
her
curiosity
to
remain
unsatisfied
when
to
her
horror
the
light
moved
out
of
the
recess
and
she
saw
that
it
was
held
by
a
tall
dark
figure
with
its
back
turned
towards
her
the
passage
was
so
long
and
the
light
flickered
so
much
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
distinguish
anything
but
the
general
outline
of
the
person
who
held
it
not
jones
or
griffith
assuredly
but
poor
helen
was
too
frightened
to
do
more
than
lock
the
door
with
her
trembling
fingers
and
leap
back
into
bed
thereby
awakening
edith
who
on
hearing
helen
story
calmly
assured
her
that
she
had
either
been
dreaming
or
had
seen
the
strange
gentleman
their
whose
existence
helen
had
rashly
dared
to
question
oddly
enough
she
had
forgotten
all
about
him
and
felt
somewhat
relieved
by
edith
solution
only
what
should
he
be
doing
at
the
clock
at
this
time
of
night
i
hope
he
is
not
out
of
his
mind
to
which
edith
replied
i
do
believe
he
gets
up
to
make
it
strike
thirteen
on
purpose
to
tease
us
monday
morning
wore
a
more
promising
aspect
than
sunday
for
such
clouds
as
there
were
bespoke
nothing
worse
than
showers
and
our
young
ladies
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
hour
or
two
sketching
at
the
lake
helen
however
felt
still
considerably
the
worse
of
her
terrible
wetting
and
was
actually
the
first
to
propose
that
they
should
return
to
the
somewhat
weakened
by
her
cold
and
tired
too
she
mounted
the
little
pony
at
edith
suggestion
and
they
were
proceeding
cheerily
enough
on
their
way
griffith
loaded
with
their
painting
materials
some
little
distance
behind
when
a
stumble
on
the
pony
part
brought
him
suddenly
to
the
ground
helen
had
been
paying
little
attention
to
her
steed
and
unprepared
for
the
shock
fell
on
her
side
with
some
little
force
a
most
undignified
procedure
had
there
been
any
one
to
witness
it
but
which
would
have
drawn
forth
nothing
but
a
laugh
had
it
not
been
that
in
the
fall
her
foot
caught
in
the
stirrup
her
sharp
cry
of
pain
terrified
edith
who
however
soon
succeeded
in
disentangling
her
as
the
poor
little
pony
remained
perfectly
quiet
but
a
examination
and
a
vain
attempt
to
stand
showed
them
that
the
ankle
was
badly
sprained
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
mount
helen
again
as
well
as
edith
and
griffith
could
manage
and
to
make
the
best
of
their
way
home
arrived
there
hot
applications
soon
reduced
the
pain
but
it
was
easy
to
be
seen
even
by
their
inexperienced
eyes
that
helen
must
not
attempt
to
move
for
several
days
to
come
here
was
a
charming
ending
to
their
expedition
helen
even
felt
woefully
disconcerted
and
poor
edith
fairly
began
to
cry
if
it
were
not
that
you
would
not
like
it
i
would
write
to
lindsay
to
come
and
nurse
you
said
edith
she
is
so
good
and
kind
and
i
know
she
would
come
in
a
minute
for
she
has
nothing
to
prevent
her
lindsay
edith
exclaimed
helen
indignantly
the
very
last
person
i
would
apply
to
however
good
and
kind
she
may
be
do
you
really
think
that
i
would
put
myself
under
such
an
obligation
to
the
sister
of
the
man
i
have
quarrelled
with
for
nothing
at
all
said
the
little
voice
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
edith
said
nothing
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
took
an
independent
resolution
and
acted
upon
it
her
love
for
helen
conquered
her
fear
of
displeasing
her
what
this
resolution
was
we
shall
not
disclose
nor
shall
we
tell
whose
hand
addressed
a
letter
to
lindsay
carried
that
evening
by
the
to
llanfar
the
strangest
coincidence
was
that
letters
bearing
the
same
direction
left
the
black
nest
farm
that
evening
tired
out
with
the
pain
of
her
ankle
helen
for
the
first
time
since
their
arrival
slept
past
midnight
and
only
woke
to
hear
the
clock
strike
five
all
too
soon
for
her
comfort
for
her
thoughts
were
none
of
the
brightest
as
she
lay
waiting
for
the
daylight
her
folly
her
headstrong
determination
right
or
wrong
to
carry
out
her
own
way
began
to
show
themselves
to
her
more
clearly
or
rather
she
began
to
allow
herself
to
see
them
in
their
true
light
and
when
at
last
the
morning
came
and
she
was
established
for
the
day
on
the
hard
little
sofa
in
their
her
spirits
were
not
improved
by
the
perusal
of
a
letter
from
her
aunt
fanny
the
good
old
lady
after
deploring
their
absence
and
pathetically
describing
her
anxiety
on
their
behalf
made
mention
of
a
visit
from
lindsay
who
had
come
to
tell
her
how
unhappy
she
was
about
her
brother
he
left
home
wrote
aunt
fanny
two
days
after
that
unfortunate
conversation
with
you
without
telling
his
sister
what
was
the
matter
at
least
she
only
gathered
that
something
unpleasant
had
happened
from
his
saying
that
you
were
leaving
home
and
that
he
did
not
expect
to
see
you
before
you
went
he
left
no
direction
beyond
telling
her
to
write
to
his
club
which
she
has
done
two
or
three
times
but
got
no
answer
she
says
he
looked
so
unlike
himself
that
she
fears
he
has
fallen
ill
somewhere
and
can
not
write
to
tell
her
oh
helen
i
do
wish
you
had
never
thought
of
this
expedition
how
very
silly
lindsay
is
to
be
so
fanciful
said
helen
in
which
view
of
the
case
little
edith
did
not
at
all
agree
though
she
hardly
dared
to
say
so
they
spent
a
dull
day
for
edith
would
not
consent
to
leave
her
sister
and
their
paintings
were
at
a
standstill
for
want
of
another
day
sketching
from
the
original
edith
said
helen
you
might
go
to
the
lake
for
an
hour
or
so
without
me
and
finish
your
sketch
and
i
might
go
on
with
mine
from
yours
to
which
edith
made
no
objection
by
night
helen
feverish
uneasiness
had
increased
and
edith
secretly
congratulated
herself
on
her
resolute
step
of
the
day
before
and
a
wretched
night
followed
in
reality
helen
was
very
anxious
and
unhappy
about
malcolm
willoughby
and
her
dreams
were
full
of
terrors
that
something
had
befallen
him
through
all
the
disagreeable
clock
again
thrust
forward
its
ugly
face
and
she
woke
in
an
indescribable
state
of
horror
fancying
that
the
clock
was
standing
by
her
bedside
striking
loudly
in
her
ears
to
a
kind
of
refrain
of
the
words
i
told
you
so
i
told
you
so
of
course
the
clock
striking
and
had
evidently
awakened
her
by
so
doing
thirteen
again
whispered
edith
it
is
really
very
disagreeable
it
sounds
to
like
the
voice
of
my
conscience
said
helen
warning
me
that
some
terrible
punishment
is
coming
upon
me
for
my
wicked
folly
yes
edith
i
see
it
all
now
and
as
soon
as
ever
i
can
move
we
shall
go
home
and
i
shall
ask
poor
aunt
fanny
to
forgive
me
i
wish
every
other
consequence
of
my
could
be
done
away
with
as
easily
as
her
displeasure
and
all
her
pride
broken
down
poor
helen
burst
into
tears
and
edith
affectionate
words
of
soothing
were
of
no
avail
to
stop
her
sobs
she
felt
rather
better
in
the
morning
however
partly
perhaps
because
the
day
was
bright
and
sunny
about
she
fell
into
a
doze
on
her
sofa
and
waking
after
an
hour
sleep
was
surprised
to
miss
edith
a
note
in
pencil
pinned
to
the
caught
her
attention
it
bore
these
words
you
are
so
nicely
asleep
i
do
like
to
waken
you
i
shall
come
back
as
early
as
i
can
but
be
alarmed
if
i
am
a
little
later
than
you
expect
she
has
gone
to
finish
the
sketch
thought
helen
uneasily
i
wish
i
had
not
asked
her
to
do
so
it
looks
dull
and
overcast
she
rang
the
for
jones
who
appeared
with
a
basin
of
soup
and
told
her
that
the
young
lady
had
set
off
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
ca
be
helped
now
said
helen
but
i
wish
i
had
not
proposed
it
the
afternoon
seemed
long
and
dull
and
yet
helen
felt
sorry
when
it
began
to
close
in
for
no
edith
had
yet
appeared
still
it
was
not
later
than
they
had
been
out
together
more
than
once
helen
tried
to
think
it
was
not
yet
dusk
outside
but
felt
this
comfort
fail
her
when
it
gradually
grew
so
indisputably
dark
that
jones
brought
in
candles
without
her
asking
for
them
are
you
not
uneasy
about
my
sister
and
griffith
mrs
jones
said
helen
but
her
anxiety
was
tenfold
increased
when
jones
replied
calmly
griffith
is
not
with
the
young
lady
i
had
to
send
him
a
message
to
llanfair
and
as
like
as
not
he
will
stay
at
his
uncle
till
the
morning
the
young
lady
said
it
did
not
matter
and
i
saddled
the
pony
for
her
myself
griffith
not
with
her
exclaimed
helen
oh
jones
what
will
become
of
her
do
be
alarmed
miss
said
the
old
woman
the
pony
is
very
steady
and
the
darkness
comes
on
so
it
seems
later
than
it
is
and
with
this
scanty
consolation
helen
was
obliged
to
remain
satisfied
jones
stirred
up
the
fire
and
set
the
tea
all
ready
but
helen
grew
sick
at
heart
as
the
time
went
on
and
still
no
edith
six
struck
the
clock
and
ticked
on
again
to
seven
helen
could
bear
it
no
longer
jones
cried
she
can
you
not
get
any
one
to
go
to
look
for
my
sister
she
may
be
on
her
way
down
the
hill
and
have
got
into
some
difficulty
with
the
pony
indeed
miss
i
do
know
what
i
can
do
there
no
one
nearer
than
old
thomas
and
he
ca
move
the
strange
gentleman
said
helen
suddenly
your
other
lodger
would
he
not
help
me
he
has
been
out
since
early
this
morning
replied
jones
and
he
told
me
he
was
not
sure
of
being
back
he
has
gone
to
meet
a
friend
helen
felt
more
in
despair
than
before
it
seemed
an
aggravation
of
her
anxiety
to
have
to
lie
still
on
the
sofa
doing
nothing
indeed
had
she
been
able
to
do
so
nothing
would
have
prevented
her
making
her
way
to
the
black
lake
and
too
probably
losing
her
own
life
in
the
endeavour
to
save
her
sister
as
it
was
she
managed
at
last
to
drag
herself
to
the
door
in
hopes
of
hearing
footsteps
up
the
path
but
nothing
broke
the
silence
save
the
tick
tick
of
the
clock
it
wore
on
to
nine
despite
her
wretchedness
and
indescribable
anxiety
she
pictured
to
herself
her
sister
her
dear
little
edith
left
so
specially
in
her
charge
cowering
on
the
moor
alone
in
that
dreary
darkness
sobbing
in
despair
of
ever
finding
her
way
out
of
that
frightful
desert
or
worse
still
lying
cold
and
dead
in
one
of
those
fearful
pits
under
the
mockingly
beautiful
moss
whence
in
all
probability
her
poor
body
even
would
never
be
recovered
it
was
too
frightful
helen
almost
shrieked
aloud
oh
my
darling
my
little
sister
come
back
do
come
back
oh
malcolm
if
only
you
were
here
how
terribly
i
am
punished
for
my
and
terribly
punished
she
was
for
the
memory
of
that
night
suffering
was
too
painful
to
recall
in
after
years
without
a
shudder
jones
was
in
helpless
distress
though
in
hopes
of
every
moment
hearing
the
pony
and
the
young
lady
at
the
gate
and
she
returned
to
her
own
domains
saying
she
had
better
have
hot
water
ready
as
miss
edith
would
be
fainting
for
her
tea
helen
remained
alone
at
the
window
of
the
the
night
was
fine
but
very
dark
darker
than
she
had
ever
seen
a
night
before
it
seemed
to
helen
she
was
almost
in
a
stupor
of
despair
she
sank
down
before
the
fire
and
never
knew
how
long
she
had
lain
there
when
she
was
roused
by
the
clock
striking
one
two
three
four
she
counted
aloud
as
if
bewitched
till
when
it
got
to
the
fatal
her
nerves
gave
way
and
with
a
scream
she
ran
or
stumbled
she
knew
not
how
along
the
passage
to
seek
for
jones
as
she
passed
the
she
was
arrested
by
the
sharp
sounds
of
steps
coming
quickly
up
the
garden
path
the
door
was
pushed
open
the
only
light
was
what
came
through
the
open
door
of
the
room
she
had
just
left
and
she
could
distinguish
nothing
but
a
tall
dark
figure
hurrying
towards
her
she
screamed
with
terror
but
stood
unable
to
move
when
to
her
intense
relief
a
voice
from
behind
the
person
she
saw
exclaimed
eagerly
helen
dearest
helen
do
be
frightened
i
am
quite
safe
and
some
one
rushed
past
the
tall
person
now
close
to
her
and
kissing
her
passionately
helen
felt
rather
than
saw
that
it
was
edith
malcolm
malcolm
she
is
fainting
called
edith
and
the
tall
person
pressed
forward
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
like
a
baby
and
unconscious
now
of
everything
helen
was
carried
back
into
the
laid
on
the
hard
little
sofa
and
there
held
tenderly
by
the
strong
yet
gentle
arms
whose
protecting
care
she
poor
foolish
child
had
fancied
she
could
so
well
dispense
with
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
helen
beaumont
had
ever
fainted
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
began
to
recover
malcolm
oh
malcolm
were
her
first
words
on
returning
consciousness
and
it
seemed
to
her
afterwards
as
if
some
one
else
had
spoken
them
for
her
her
good
angel
perhaps
can
you
ever
forgive
me
my
darling
was
the
whispered
answer
you
know
you
need
not
ask
it
and
then
helen
felt
as
if
she
were
just
going
to
die
but
was
too
happy
to
care
and
too
languid
to
ask
even
how
all
this
had
come
about
but
now
a
third
person
came
forward
saying
malcolm
let
me
stay
beside
her
and
wonderful
to
tell
the
sweet
voice
and
kind
face
were
lindsay
helen
thought
she
must
be
dreaming
but
lay
still
as
she
was
told
and
then
drank
something
or
other
lindsay
brought
her
so
before
long
she
was
able
to
sit
up
and
begin
to
wonder
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
all
are
you
not
amazed
helen
said
edith
but
first
of
all
you
must
forgive
me
for
frightening
you
so
for
indeed
i
have
been
nearly
as
wretched
as
you
thinking
of
what
you
must
have
been
feeling
and
before
helen
could
reply
the
eager
girl
ran
on
with
her
explanations
who
do
you
think
has
been
our
all
this
time
helen
who
do
you
think
is
the
gentleman
only
fancy
malcolm
having
been
here
ever
since
we
came
it
was
he
that
travelled
by
the
same
train
and
seeing
as
it
moved
off
at
llanfar
that
we
had
got
out
he
did
so
at
the
next
station
and
arrived
here
before
us
he
had
inquired
about
jones
and
heard
what
a
good
creature
she
was
and
he
had
time
to
have
a
talk
with
her
and
to
take
her
to
some
extent
into
his
confidence
helen
looked
at
first
as
this
recital
went
on
as
if
she
were
wavering
between
a
return
to
her
old
dislike
to
being
interfered
with
and
gratitude
to
malcolm
for
his
undeserved
devotion
the
good
angel
triumphed
as
malcolm
who
was
watching
her
anxiously
quickly
perceived
i
did
not
interfere
with
you
helen
he
said
in
a
low
voice
but
it
was
the
greatest
comfort
to
me
to
be
able
to
protect
and
care
for
you
even
though
you
did
not
know
it
the
tears
started
to
helen
eyes
oh
malcolm
i
know
how
good
you
are
but
never
mind
any
said
lindsay
brightly
catching
the
last
word
well
that
ends
well
i
know
now
who
foraged
for
us
so
successfully
said
edith
who
was
the
mysterious
friend
that
gave
jones
the
mushrooms
and
nearly
betrayed
myself
by
laughing
at
the
door
when
passing
i
heard
helen
enthusiastic
thanks
to
jones
said
malcolm
yes
and
frightened
me
horribly
by
so
doing
added
helen
as
i
really
began
to
think
that
clock
was
bewitched
and
had
a
special
against
me
in
fact
it
took
the
place
of
my
conscience
for
the
time
being
i
have
the
very
greatest
regard
for
the
clock
said
malcolm
demurely
and
i
intend
to
make
jones
an
offer
for
it
forthwith
please
do
said
helen
piteously
i
daresay
it
is
very
silly
but
i
really
do
quite
like
that
clock
though
after
all
its
warning
of
has
brought
the
very
reverse
to
me
but
i
have
not
heard
yet
what
kept
edith
out
so
late
or
how
in
the
world
you
and
lindsay
met
her
at
the
black
lake
the
black
lake
said
lindsay
what
do
you
mean
whereupon
edith
hastened
on
with
that
part
of
her
story
relating
to
her
own
adventures
she
it
appeared
feeling
confident
in
ready
kindness
and
never
doubting
but
what
she
would
at
once
respond
to
her
appeal
by
coming
to
nurse
helen
instead
of
going
to
the
black
lake
to
sketch
as
helen
imagined
set
off
on
the
pony
to
meet
her
friend
at
the
station
having
proposed
to
her
to
come
by
a
certain
train
overtaking
griffith
on
the
road
to
llanfair
as
she
expected
from
jones
account
he
accompanied
her
to
the
village
where
she
gave
over
the
pony
to
his
care
as
she
entered
the
station
she
saw
a
return
train
about
to
start
for
the
junction
about
half
an
hour
journey
from
where
she
was
finding
by
her
watch
that
she
was
in
ample
time
it
struck
her
that
she
might
as
well
go
so
far
to
meet
her
friend
but
on
arriving
at
the
junction
she
was
startled
to
find
that
with
the
new
month
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
trains
and
that
consequently
lindsay
could
not
arrive
till
late
in
the
evening
worse
still
she
herself
could
not
now
get
back
to
helen
till
she
was
frightened
to
think
what
hour
the
evening
train
in
question
not
going
farther
than
llanfar
the
station
near
the
junction
at
which
she
and
her
sister
had
by
mistake
got
out
on
their
arrival
and
which
was
fifteen
miles
from
the
black
nest
it
is
needless
to
describe
her
distress
of
mind
all
the
long
hours
she
had
to
sit
in
the
little
at
the
junction
or
her
corresponding
delight
when
on
the
train
coming
up
she
descried
looking
out
of
a
window
the
familiar
face
of
malcolm
willoughby
and
found
that
he
was
accompanied
by
his
sister
whom
he
had
gone
to
meet
on
her
journey
helen
woke
at
noon
the
next
day
feeling
indescribably
happy
she
could
not
tell
why
till
the
sight
of
lindsay
sweet
face
recalled
to
her
mind
all
her
misery
of
the
night
before
and
the
relief
and
happiness
with
which
it
had
ended
how
little
i
deserve
it
thought
she
humbly
and
gratefully
and
how
can
i
ever
repay
malcolm
for
his
goodness
their
dull
little
parlour
looked
very
different
now
that
it
was
enlivened
by
the
presence
of
the
two
newcomers
and
helen
could
scarcely
believe
it
to
be
the
same
room
in
which
but
yesterday
she
had
passed
hours
of
such
agonising
suspense
so
thoroughly
penitent
and
softened
did
she
feel
that
she
offered
no
opposition
to
anything
proposed
and
it
was
therefore
arranged
that
as
soon
as
helen
was
well
enough
to
travel
they
should
all
return
home
together
to
relieve
poor
aunt
anxiety
i
wonder
said
helen
with
a
little
sigh
a
few
days
afterwards
when
they
were
packing
up
their
painting
materials
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
finish
my
sketch
of
the
black
lake
i
do
like
to
make
rash
promises
said
malcolm
but
if
somebody
i
know
is
good
perhaps
next
summer
she
may
see
the
black
lake
again
provided
she
will
neither
catch
cold
nor
tumble
off
her
pony
edith
laughed
and
helen
blushed
but
there
one
thing
still
said
edith
which
i
do
understand
why
malcolm
did
you
always
shut
your
door
as
the
clock
struck
thirteen
very
simply
explained
replied
he
the
first
night
i
was
here
i
was
sitting
up
reading
till
midnight
and
thought
i
heard
it
strike
thirteen
i
thought
it
very
odd
and
for
a
night
or
two
i
listened
till
it
began
to
strike
and
then
opened
my
door
to
make
sure
i
was
not
mistaken
and
one
night
i
went
out
with
my
candle
to
examine
the
clock
trying
to
make
out
the
cause
of
it
and
to
see
if
i
could
put
it
right
no
man
they
say
can
resist
meddling
with
a
clock
even
though
he
is
no
mechanical
genius
all
the
same
said
edith
triumphantly
notwithstanding
your
examinations
you
and
no
one
else
can
tell
the
reason
why
that
clock
does
strike
thirteen
