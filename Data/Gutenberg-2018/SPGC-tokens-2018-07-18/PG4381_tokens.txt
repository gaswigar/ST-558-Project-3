the
aran
islands
by
john
synge
introduction
the
geography
of
the
aran
islands
is
very
simple
yet
it
may
need
a
word
to
itself
there
are
three
islands
aranmor
the
north
island
about
nine
miles
long
inishmaan
the
middle
island
about
three
miles
and
a
half
across
and
nearly
round
in
form
and
the
south
island
inishere
in
irish
east
island
like
the
middle
island
but
slightly
smaller
they
lie
about
thirty
miles
from
galway
up
the
centre
of
the
bay
but
they
are
not
far
from
the
cliffs
of
county
clare
on
the
south
or
the
corner
of
connemara
on
the
north
kilronan
the
principal
village
on
aranmor
has
been
so
much
changed
by
the
fishing
industry
developed
there
by
the
congested
districts
board
that
it
has
now
very
little
to
distinguish
it
from
any
fishing
village
on
the
west
coast
of
ireland
the
other
islands
are
more
primitive
but
even
on
them
many
changes
are
being
made
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
deal
with
in
the
text
in
the
pages
that
follow
i
have
given
a
direct
account
of
my
life
on
the
islands
and
of
what
i
met
with
among
them
inventing
nothing
and
changing
nothing
that
is
essential
as
far
as
possible
however
i
have
disguised
the
identity
of
the
people
i
speak
of
by
making
changes
in
their
names
and
in
the
letters
i
quote
and
by
altering
some
local
and
family
relationships
i
have
had
nothing
to
say
about
them
that
was
not
wholly
in
their
favour
but
i
have
made
this
disguise
to
keep
them
from
ever
feeling
that
a
too
direct
use
had
been
made
of
their
kindness
and
friendship
for
which
i
am
more
grateful
than
it
is
easy
to
say
part
i
i
am
in
aranmor
sitting
over
a
turf
fire
listening
to
a
murmur
of
gaelic
that
is
rising
from
a
little
under
my
room
the
steamer
which
comes
to
aran
sails
according
to
the
tide
and
it
was
six
this
morning
when
we
left
the
quay
of
galway
in
a
dense
shroud
of
mist
a
low
line
of
shore
was
visible
at
first
on
the
right
between
the
movement
of
the
waves
and
fog
but
when
we
came
further
it
was
lost
sight
of
and
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
mist
curling
in
the
rigging
and
a
small
circle
of
foam
there
were
few
passengers
a
couple
of
men
going
out
with
young
pigs
tied
loosely
in
sacking
three
or
four
young
girls
who
sat
in
the
cabin
with
their
heads
completely
twisted
in
their
shawls
and
a
builder
on
his
way
to
repair
the
pier
at
kilronan
who
walked
up
and
down
and
talked
with
me
in
about
three
hours
aran
came
in
sight
a
dreary
rock
appeared
at
first
sloping
up
from
the
sea
into
the
fog
then
as
we
drew
nearer
a
station
and
the
village
a
little
later
i
was
wandering
out
along
the
one
good
roadway
of
the
island
looking
over
low
walls
on
either
side
into
small
flat
fields
of
naked
rock
i
have
seen
nothing
so
desolate
grey
floods
of
water
were
sweeping
everywhere
upon
the
limestone
making
at
limes
a
wild
torrent
of
the
road
which
twined
continually
over
low
hills
and
cavities
in
the
rock
or
passed
between
a
few
small
fields
of
potatoes
or
grass
hidden
away
in
corners
that
had
shelter
whenever
the
cloud
lifted
i
could
see
the
edge
of
the
sea
below
me
on
the
right
and
the
naked
ridge
of
the
island
above
me
on
the
other
side
occasionally
i
passed
a
lonely
chapel
or
schoolhouse
or
a
line
of
stone
pillars
with
crosses
above
them
and
inscriptions
asking
a
prayer
for
the
soul
of
the
person
they
commemorated
i
met
few
people
but
here
and
there
a
band
of
tall
girls
passed
me
on
their
way
to
kilronan
and
called
out
to
me
with
humorous
wonder
speaking
english
with
a
slight
foreign
intonation
that
differed
a
good
deal
from
the
brogue
of
galway
the
rain
and
cold
seemed
to
have
no
influence
on
their
vitality
and
as
they
hurried
past
me
with
eager
laughter
and
great
talking
in
gaelic
they
left
the
wet
masses
of
rock
more
desolate
than
before
a
little
after
midday
when
i
was
coming
back
one
old
man
spoke
to
me
in
gaelic
but
in
general
i
was
surprised
at
the
abundance
and
fluency
of
the
foreign
tongue
in
the
afternoon
the
rain
continued
so
i
sat
here
in
the
inn
looking
out
through
the
mist
at
a
few
men
who
were
unlading
hookers
that
had
come
in
with
turf
from
connemara
and
at
the
pigs
that
were
playing
in
the
surf
as
the
fishermen
came
in
and
out
of
the
underneath
my
room
i
could
hear
through
the
broken
panes
that
a
number
of
them
still
used
the
gaelic
though
it
seems
to
be
falling
out
of
use
among
the
younger
people
of
this
village
the
old
woman
of
the
house
had
promised
to
get
me
a
teacher
of
the
language
and
after
a
while
i
heard
a
shuffling
on
the
stairs
and
the
old
dark
man
i
had
spoken
to
in
the
morning
groped
his
way
into
the
room
i
brought
him
over
to
the
fire
and
we
talked
for
many
hours
he
told
me
that
he
had
known
petrie
and
sir
william
wilde
and
many
living
antiquarians
and
had
taught
irish
to
finck
and
pedersen
and
given
stories
to
curtin
of
america
a
little
after
middle
age
he
had
fallen
over
a
cliff
and
since
then
he
had
had
little
eyesight
and
a
trembling
of
his
hands
and
head
as
we
talked
he
sat
huddled
together
over
the
fire
shaking
and
blind
yet
his
face
was
indescribably
pliant
lighting
up
with
an
ecstasy
of
humour
when
he
told
me
anything
that
had
a
point
of
wit
or
malice
and
growing
sombre
and
desolate
again
when
he
spoke
of
religion
or
the
fairies
he
had
great
confidence
in
his
own
powers
and
talent
and
in
the
superiority
of
his
stories
over
all
other
stories
in
the
world
when
we
were
speaking
of
curtin
he
told
me
that
this
gentleman
had
brought
out
a
volume
of
his
aran
stories
in
america
and
made
five
hundred
pounds
by
the
sale
of
them
what
do
you
think
he
did
then
he
continued
wrote
a
book
of
his
own
stories
after
making
that
lot
of
money
with
mine
and
he
brought
them
out
and
the
divil
a
did
he
get
for
them
would
you
believe
that
afterwards
he
told
me
how
one
of
his
children
had
been
taken
by
the
fairies
one
day
a
neighbor
was
passing
and
she
said
when
she
saw
it
on
the
road
a
fine
child
its
mother
tried
to
say
bless
it
but
something
choked
the
words
in
her
throat
a
while
later
they
found
a
wound
on
its
neck
and
for
three
nights
the
house
was
filled
with
noises
never
wear
a
shirt
at
night
he
said
i
got
up
out
of
my
bed
all
naked
as
i
was
when
i
heard
the
noises
in
the
house
and
lighted
a
light
but
there
was
nothing
in
it
then
a
dummy
came
and
made
signs
of
hammering
nails
in
a
coffin
the
next
day
the
seed
potatoes
were
full
of
blood
and
the
child
told
his
mother
that
he
was
going
to
america
that
night
it
died
and
me
said
the
old
man
fairies
were
in
it
when
he
went
away
a
little
girl
was
sent
up
with
turf
and
the
bellows
to
make
a
fire
that
would
last
for
the
evening
she
was
shy
yet
eager
to
talk
and
told
me
that
she
had
good
spoken
irish
and
was
learning
to
read
it
in
the
school
and
that
she
had
been
twice
to
galway
though
there
are
many
grown
women
in
the
place
who
have
never
set
a
foot
upon
the
mainland
the
rain
has
cleared
off
and
i
have
had
my
first
real
introduction
to
the
island
and
its
people
i
went
out
through
killeany
the
poorest
village
in
aranmor
to
a
long
neck
of
sandhill
that
runs
out
into
the
sea
towards
the
as
i
lay
there
on
the
grass
the
clouds
lifted
from
the
connemara
mountains
and
for
a
moment
the
green
undulating
foreground
backed
in
the
distance
by
a
mass
of
hills
reminded
me
of
the
country
near
rome
then
the
dun
of
a
hooker
swept
above
the
edge
of
the
sandhill
and
revealed
the
presence
of
the
sea
as
i
moved
on
a
boy
and
a
man
came
down
from
the
next
village
to
talk
to
me
and
i
found
that
here
at
least
english
was
imperfectly
understood
when
i
asked
them
if
there
were
any
trees
in
the
island
they
held
a
hurried
consultation
in
gaelic
and
then
the
man
asked
if
meant
the
same
thing
as
for
if
so
there
were
a
few
in
sheltered
hollows
to
the
east
they
walked
on
with
me
to
the
sound
which
separates
this
island
from
inishmaan
the
middle
island
of
the
group
and
showed
me
the
roll
from
the
atlantic
running
up
between
two
walls
of
cliff
they
told
me
that
several
men
had
stayed
on
inishmaan
to
learn
irish
and
the
boy
pointed
out
a
line
of
hovels
where
they
had
lodged
running
like
a
belt
of
straw
round
the
middle
of
the
island
the
place
looked
hardly
fit
for
habitation
there
was
no
green
to
be
seen
and
no
sign
of
the
people
except
these
roofs
and
the
outline
of
a
dun
that
stood
out
above
them
against
the
edge
of
the
sky
after
a
while
my
companions
went
away
and
two
other
boys
came
and
walked
at
my
heels
till
i
turned
and
made
them
talk
to
me
they
spoke
at
first
of
their
poverty
and
then
one
of
them
said
dare
say
you
do
have
to
pay
ten
shillings
a
week
in
the
hotel
i
answered
still
then
he
drew
back
and
did
not
question
me
any
further
either
thinking
that
i
had
lied
to
check
his
curiosity
or
too
awed
by
my
riches
to
continue
repassing
killeany
i
was
joined
by
a
man
who
had
spent
twenty
years
in
america
where
he
had
lost
his
health
and
then
returned
so
long
ago
that
he
had
forgotten
english
and
could
hardly
make
me
understand
him
he
seemed
hopeless
dirty
and
asthmatic
and
after
going
with
me
for
a
few
hundred
yards
he
stopped
and
asked
for
coppers
i
had
none
left
so
i
gave
him
a
fill
of
tobacco
and
he
went
back
to
his
hovel
when
he
was
gone
two
little
girls
took
their
place
behind
me
and
i
drew
them
in
turn
into
conversation
they
spoke
with
a
delicate
exotic
intonation
that
was
full
of
charm
and
told
me
with
a
sort
of
chant
how
they
guide
and
gintlemins
in
the
summer
to
all
that
is
worth
seeing
in
their
neighbourhood
and
sell
them
pampooties
and
maidenhair
ferns
which
are
common
among
the
rocks
we
were
now
in
kilronan
and
as
we
parted
they
showed
me
holes
in
their
own
pampooties
or
cowskin
sandals
and
asked
me
the
price
of
new
ones
i
told
them
that
my
purse
was
empty
and
then
with
a
few
quaint
words
of
blessing
they
turned
away
from
me
and
went
down
to
the
pier
all
this
walk
back
had
been
extraordinarily
fine
the
intense
insular
clearness
one
sees
only
in
ireland
and
after
rain
was
throwing
out
every
ripple
in
the
sea
and
sky
and
every
crevice
in
the
hills
beyond
the
bay
this
evening
an
old
man
came
to
see
me
and
said
he
had
known
a
relative
of
mine
who
passed
some
time
on
this
island
years
ago
was
standing
under
the
mending
nets
he
said
you
came
off
the
steamer
and
i
said
to
myself
in
that
moment
if
there
is
a
man
of
the
name
of
synge
left
walking
the
world
it
is
that
man
yonder
will
be
he
he
went
on
to
complain
in
curiously
simple
yet
dignified
language
of
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
here
since
he
left
the
island
to
go
to
sea
before
the
end
of
his
childhood
have
come
back
he
said
live
in
a
bit
of
a
house
with
my
sister
the
island
is
not
the
same
at
all
to
what
it
was
it
is
little
good
i
can
get
from
the
people
who
are
in
it
now
and
anything
i
have
to
give
them
they
do
care
to
have
from
what
i
hear
this
man
seems
to
have
shut
himself
up
in
a
world
of
individual
conceits
and
theories
and
to
live
aloof
at
his
trade
of
regarded
by
the
other
islanders
with
respect
and
sympathy
a
little
later
when
i
went
down
to
the
kitchen
i
found
two
men
from
inishmaan
who
had
been
benighted
on
the
island
they
seemed
a
simpler
and
perhaps
a
more
interesting
type
than
the
people
here
and
talked
with
careful
english
about
the
history
of
the
duns
and
the
book
of
ballymote
and
the
book
of
kells
and
other
ancient
with
the
names
of
which
they
seemed
familiar
in
spite
of
the
charm
of
my
teacher
the
old
blind
man
i
met
the
day
of
my
arrival
i
have
decided
to
move
on
to
inishmaan
where
gaelic
is
more
generally
used
and
the
life
is
perhaps
the
most
primitive
that
is
left
in
europe
i
spent
all
this
last
day
with
my
blind
guide
looking
at
the
antiquities
that
abound
in
the
west
or
of
the
island
as
we
set
out
i
noticed
among
the
groups
of
girls
who
smiled
at
our
fellowship
old
mourteen
says
we
are
like
the
cuckoo
with
its
pipit
a
beautiful
oval
face
with
the
singularly
spiritual
expression
that
is
so
marked
in
one
type
of
the
west
ireland
women
later
in
the
day
as
the
old
man
talked
continually
of
the
fairies
and
the
women
they
have
taken
it
seemed
that
there
was
a
possible
link
between
the
wild
mythology
that
is
accepted
on
the
islands
and
the
strange
beauty
of
the
women
at
midday
we
rested
near
the
ruins
of
a
house
and
two
beautiful
boys
came
up
and
sat
near
us
old
mourteen
asked
them
why
the
house
was
in
ruins
and
who
had
lived
in
it
rich
farmer
built
it
a
while
since
they
said
after
two
years
he
was
driven
away
by
the
fairy
host
the
boys
came
on
with
us
some
distance
to
the
north
to
visit
one
of
the
ancient
beehive
dwellings
that
is
still
in
perfect
preservation
when
we
crawled
in
on
our
hands
and
knees
and
stood
up
in
the
gloom
of
the
interior
old
mourteen
took
a
freak
of
earthly
humour
and
began
telling
what
he
would
have
done
if
he
could
have
come
in
there
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
a
young
girl
along
with
him
then
he
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
began
to
recite
old
irish
poetry
with
an
exquisite
purity
of
intonation
that
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
though
i
understood
but
little
of
the
meaning
on
our
way
home
he
gave
me
the
catholic
theory
of
the
fairies
when
lucifer
saw
himself
in
the
glass
he
thought
himself
equal
with
god
then
the
lord
threw
him
out
of
heaven
and
all
the
angels
that
belonged
to
him
while
he
was
them
out
an
archangel
asked
him
to
spare
some
of
them
and
those
that
were
falling
are
in
the
air
still
and
have
power
to
wreck
ships
and
to
work
evil
in
the
world
from
this
he
wandered
off
into
tedious
matters
of
theology
and
repeated
many
long
prayers
and
sermons
in
irish
that
he
had
heard
from
the
priests
a
little
further
on
we
came
to
a
slated
house
and
i
asked
him
who
was
living
in
it
kind
of
a
schoolmistress
he
said
then
his
old
face
puckered
with
a
gleam
of
pagan
malice
master
he
said
it
be
fine
to
be
in
there
and
to
be
kissing
her
a
couple
of
miles
from
this
village
we
turned
aside
to
look
at
an
old
ruined
church
of
the
ceathair
aluinn
the
four
beautiful
persons
and
a
holy
well
near
it
that
is
famous
for
cures
of
blindness
and
epilepsy
as
we
sat
near
the
well
a
very
old
man
came
up
from
a
cottage
near
the
road
and
told
me
how
it
had
become
famous
woman
of
sligo
had
a
son
who
was
born
blind
and
one
night
she
dreamed
that
she
saw
an
island
with
a
blessed
well
in
it
that
could
cure
her
son
she
told
her
dream
in
the
morning
and
an
old
man
said
it
was
of
aran
she
was
after
dreaming
brought
her
son
down
by
the
coast
of
galway
and
came
out
in
a
curagh
and
landed
below
where
you
see
a
bit
of
a
cove
walked
up
then
to
the
house
of
my
father
god
rest
his
soul
and
she
told
them
what
she
was
looking
for
father
said
that
there
was
a
well
like
what
she
had
dreamed
of
and
that
he
would
send
a
boy
along
with
her
to
show
her
the
way
there
no
need
at
all
said
she
have
i
seen
it
all
in
my
dream
she
went
out
with
the
child
and
walked
up
to
this
well
and
she
kneeled
down
and
began
saying
her
prayers
then
she
put
her
hand
out
for
the
water
and
put
it
on
his
eyes
and
the
moment
it
touched
him
he
called
out
o
mother
look
at
the
pretty
flowers
after
that
mourteen
described
the
feats
of
poteen
drinking
and
fighting
that
he
did
in
his
youth
and
went
on
to
talk
of
diarmid
who
was
the
strongest
man
after
samson
and
of
one
of
the
beds
of
diarmid
and
grainne
which
is
on
the
east
of
the
island
he
says
that
diarmid
was
killed
by
the
druids
who
put
a
burning
shirt
on
him
a
fragment
of
mythology
that
may
connect
diarmid
with
the
legend
of
hercules
if
it
is
not
due
to
the
in
some
master
ballad
then
we
talked
about
inishmaan
have
an
old
man
to
talk
with
you
over
there
he
said
tell
you
stories
of
the
fairies
but
he
walking
about
with
two
sticks
under
him
this
ten
year
did
ever
you
hear
what
it
is
goes
on
four
legs
when
it
is
young
and
on
two
legs
after
that
and
on
three
legs
when
it
does
be
old
i
gave
him
the
answer
master
he
said
a
cute
one
and
the
blessing
of
god
be
on
you
well
i
on
three
legs
this
minute
but
the
old
man
beyond
is
back
on
four
i
do
know
if
i
better
than
the
way
he
is
he
got
his
sight
and
i
only
an
old
dark
man
i
am
settled
at
last
on
inishmaan
in
a
small
cottage
with
a
continual
drone
of
gaelic
coming
from
the
kitchen
that
opens
into
my
room
early
this
morning
the
man
of
the
house
came
over
for
me
with
a
curagh
that
is
a
curagh
with
four
rowers
and
four
oars
on
either
side
as
each
man
uses
two
and
we
set
off
a
little
before
noon
it
gave
me
a
moment
of
exquisite
satisfaction
to
find
myself
moving
away
from
civilisation
in
this
rude
canvas
canoe
of
a
model
that
has
served
primitive
races
since
men
first
went
to
sea
we
had
to
stop
for
a
moment
at
a
hulk
that
is
anchored
in
the
bay
to
make
some
arrangement
for
the
of
the
middle
island
and
my
crew
called
out
as
soon
as
we
were
within
earshot
that
they
had
a
man
with
them
who
had
been
in
france
a
month
from
this
day
when
we
started
again
a
small
sail
was
run
up
in
the
bow
and
we
set
off
across
the
sound
with
a
leaping
oscillation
that
had
no
resemblance
to
the
heavy
movement
of
a
boat
the
sail
is
only
used
as
an
aid
so
the
men
continued
to
row
after
it
had
gone
up
and
as
they
occupied
the
four
i
lay
on
the
canvas
at
the
stern
and
the
frame
of
slender
laths
which
bent
and
quivered
as
the
waves
passed
under
them
when
we
set
off
it
was
a
brilliant
morning
of
april
and
the
green
glittering
waves
seemed
to
toss
the
canoe
among
themselves
yet
as
we
drew
nearer
this
island
a
sudden
thunderstorm
broke
out
behind
the
rocks
we
were
approaching
and
lent
a
momentary
tumult
to
this
still
vein
of
the
atlantic
we
landed
at
a
small
pier
from
which
a
rude
track
leads
up
to
the
village
between
small
fields
and
bare
sheets
of
rock
like
those
in
aranmor
the
youngest
son
of
my
boatman
a
boy
of
about
seventeen
who
is
to
be
my
teacher
and
guide
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
pier
and
guided
me
to
his
house
while
the
men
settled
the
curagh
and
followed
slowly
with
my
baggage
my
room
is
at
one
end
of
the
cottage
with
a
boarded
floor
and
ceiling
and
two
windows
opposite
each
other
then
there
is
the
kitchen
with
earth
floor
and
open
rafters
and
two
doors
opposite
each
other
opening
into
the
open
air
but
no
windows
beyond
it
there
are
two
small
rooms
of
half
the
width
of
the
kitchen
with
one
window
apiece
the
kitchen
itself
where
i
will
spend
most
of
my
time
is
full
of
beauty
and
distinction
the
red
dresses
of
the
women
who
cluster
round
the
fire
on
their
stools
give
a
glow
of
almost
eastern
richness
and
the
walls
have
been
toned
by
the
to
a
soft
brown
that
blends
with
the
grey
of
the
floor
many
sorts
of
and
the
nets
and
of
the
men
are
hung
upon
the
walls
or
among
the
open
rafters
and
right
overhead
under
the
thatch
there
is
a
whole
cowskin
from
which
they
make
pampooties
every
article
on
these
islands
has
an
almost
personal
character
which
gives
this
simple
life
where
all
art
is
unknown
something
of
the
artistic
beauty
of
medieval
life
the
curaghs
and
the
tiny
wooden
barrels
that
are
still
much
used
in
the
place
of
earthenware
the
cradles
churns
and
baskets
are
all
full
of
individuality
and
being
made
from
materials
that
are
common
here
yet
to
some
extent
peculiar
to
the
island
they
seem
to
exist
as
a
natural
link
between
the
people
and
the
world
that
is
about
them
the
simplicity
and
unity
of
the
dress
increases
in
another
way
the
local
air
of
beauty
the
women
wear
red
petticoats
and
jackets
of
the
island
wool
stained
with
madder
to
which
they
usually
add
a
plaid
shawl
twisted
round
their
chests
and
tied
at
their
back
when
it
rains
they
throw
another
petticoat
over
their
heads
with
the
waistband
round
their
faces
or
if
they
are
young
they
use
a
heavy
shawl
like
those
worn
in
galway
occasionally
other
wraps
are
worn
and
during
the
thunderstorm
i
arrived
in
i
saw
several
girls
with
men
waistcoats
buttoned
round
their
bodies
their
skirts
do
not
come
much
below
the
knee
and
show
their
powerful
legs
in
the
heavy
indigo
stockings
with
which
they
are
all
provided
the
men
wear
three
colours
the
natural
wool
indigo
and
a
grey
flannel
that
is
woven
of
alternate
threads
of
indigo
and
the
natural
wool
in
aranmor
many
of
the
younger
men
have
adopted
the
usual
fisherman
jersey
but
i
have
only
seen
one
on
this
island
as
flannel
is
cheap
the
women
spin
the
yarn
from
the
wool
of
their
own
sheep
and
it
is
then
woven
by
a
weaver
in
kilronan
for
fourpence
a
yard
the
men
seem
to
wear
an
indefinite
number
of
waistcoats
and
woollen
drawers
one
over
the
other
they
are
usually
surprised
at
the
lightness
of
my
own
dress
and
one
old
man
i
spoke
to
for
a
minute
on
the
pier
when
i
came
ashore
asked
me
if
i
was
not
cold
with
little
clothes
as
i
sat
in
the
kitchen
to
dry
the
spray
from
my
coat
several
men
who
had
seen
me
walking
up
came
in
to
me
to
talk
to
me
usually
murmuring
on
the
threshold
blessing
of
god
on
this
place
or
some
similar
words
the
courtesy
of
the
old
woman
of
the
house
is
singularly
attractive
and
though
i
could
not
understand
much
of
what
she
said
she
has
no
english
i
could
see
with
how
much
grace
she
motioned
each
visitor
to
a
chair
or
stool
according
to
his
age
and
said
a
few
words
to
him
till
he
drifted
into
our
english
conversation
for
the
moment
my
own
arrival
is
the
chief
subject
of
interest
and
the
men
who
come
in
are
eager
to
talk
to
me
some
of
them
express
themselves
more
correctly
than
the
ordinary
peasant
others
use
the
gaelic
idioms
continually
and
substitute
or
for
as
the
neuter
pronoun
is
not
found
in
modern
irish
a
few
of
the
men
have
a
curiously
full
vocabulary
others
know
only
the
commonest
words
in
english
and
are
driven
to
ingenious
devices
to
express
their
meaning
of
all
the
subjects
we
can
talk
of
war
seems
their
favourite
and
the
conflict
between
america
and
spain
is
causing
a
great
deal
of
excitement
nearly
all
the
families
have
relations
who
have
had
to
cross
the
atlantic
and
all
eat
of
the
flour
and
bacon
that
is
brought
from
the
united
states
so
they
have
a
vague
fear
that
anything
happened
to
america
their
own
island
would
cease
to
be
habitable
foreign
languages
are
another
favourite
topic
and
as
these
men
are
bilingual
they
have
a
fair
notion
of
what
it
means
to
speak
and
think
in
many
different
idioms
most
of
the
strangers
they
see
on
the
islands
are
philological
students
and
the
people
have
been
led
to
conclude
that
linguistic
studies
particularly
gaelic
studies
are
the
chief
occupation
of
the
outside
world
have
seen
frenchmen
and
danes
and
germans
said
one
man
there
does
be
a
power
a
irish
books
along
with
them
and
they
reading
them
better
than
ourselves
believe
me
there
are
few
rich
men
now
in
the
world
who
are
not
studying
the
gaelic
they
sometimes
ask
me
the
french
for
simple
phrases
and
when
they
have
listened
to
the
intonation
for
a
moment
most
of
them
are
able
to
reproduce
it
with
admirable
precision
when
i
was
going
out
this
morning
to
walk
round
the
island
with
michael
the
boy
who
is
teaching
me
irish
i
met
an
old
man
making
his
way
down
to
the
cottage
he
was
dressed
in
miserable
black
clothes
which
seemed
to
have
come
from
the
mainland
and
was
so
bent
with
rheumatism
that
at
a
little
distance
he
looked
more
like
a
spider
than
a
human
being
michael
told
me
it
was
pat
dirane
the
old
mourteen
had
spoken
of
on
the
other
island
i
wished
to
turn
back
as
he
appeared
to
be
on
his
way
to
visit
me
but
michael
would
not
hear
of
it
will
be
sitting
by
the
fire
when
we
come
in
he
said
you
not
be
afraid
there
will
be
time
enough
to
be
talking
to
him
by
and
by
he
was
right
as
i
came
down
into
the
kitchen
some
hours
later
old
pat
was
still
in
the
blinking
with
the
turf
smoke
he
spoke
english
with
remarkable
aptness
and
fluency
due
i
believe
to
the
months
he
spent
in
the
english
provinces
working
at
the
harvest
when
he
was
a
young
man
after
a
few
formal
compliments
he
told
me
how
he
had
been
crippled
by
an
attack
of
the
hin
the
influenza
and
had
been
complaining
ever
since
in
addition
to
his
rheumatism
while
the
old
woman
was
cooking
my
dinner
he
asked
me
if
i
liked
stories
and
offered
to
tell
one
in
english
though
he
added
it
would
be
much
better
if
i
could
follow
the
gaelic
then
he
began
there
were
two
farmers
in
county
clare
one
had
a
son
and
the
other
a
fine
rich
man
had
a
daughter
the
young
man
was
wishing
to
marry
the
girl
and
his
father
told
him
to
try
and
get
her
if
he
thought
well
though
a
power
of
gold
would
be
wanting
to
get
the
like
of
her
will
try
said
the
young
man
he
put
all
his
gold
into
a
bag
then
he
went
over
to
the
other
farm
and
threw
in
the
gold
in
front
of
him
that
all
gold
said
the
father
of
the
girl
gold
said
the
young
man
name
was
will
not
weigh
down
my
daughter
said
the
father
see
that
said
then
they
put
them
in
the
scales
the
daughter
in
one
side
and
the
gold
in
the
other
the
girl
went
down
against
the
ground
so
took
his
bag
and
went
out
on
the
road
as
he
was
going
along
he
came
to
where
there
was
a
little
man
and
he
standing
with
his
back
against
the
wall
are
you
going
with
the
bag
said
the
little
man
home
said
it
gold
you
might
be
wanting
said
the
man
is
surely
said
give
you
what
you
are
wanting
said
the
man
we
can
bargain
in
this
way
you
pay
me
back
in
a
year
the
gold
i
give
you
or
you
pay
me
with
five
pounds
cut
off
your
own
flesh
that
bargain
was
made
between
them
the
man
gave
a
bag
of
gold
to
and
he
went
back
with
it
and
was
married
to
the
young
woman
they
were
rich
people
and
he
built
her
a
grand
castle
on
the
cliffs
of
clare
with
a
window
that
looked
out
straight
over
the
wild
ocean
one
day
when
he
went
up
with
his
wife
to
look
out
over
the
wild
ocean
he
saw
a
ship
coming
in
on
the
rocks
and
no
sails
on
her
at
all
she
was
wrecked
on
the
rocks
and
it
was
tea
that
was
in
her
and
fine
silk
and
his
wife
went
down
to
look
at
the
wreck
and
when
the
lady
saw
the
silk
she
said
she
wished
a
dress
of
it
they
got
the
silk
from
the
sailors
and
when
the
captain
came
up
to
get
the
money
for
it
asked
him
to
come
again
and
take
his
dinner
with
them
they
had
a
grand
dinner
and
they
drank
after
it
and
the
captain
was
tipsy
while
they
were
still
drinking
a
letter
came
to
and
it
was
in
the
letter
that
a
friend
of
his
was
dead
and
that
he
would
have
to
go
away
on
a
long
journey
as
he
was
getting
ready
the
captain
came
to
him
you
fond
of
your
wife
said
the
captain
am
fond
of
her
said
you
make
me
a
bet
of
twenty
guineas
no
man
comes
near
her
while
you
be
away
on
the
journey
said
the
captain
will
bet
it
said
and
he
went
away
there
was
an
old
hag
who
sold
small
things
on
the
road
near
the
castle
and
the
lady
allowed
her
to
sleep
up
in
her
room
in
a
big
box
the
captain
went
down
on
the
road
to
the
old
hag
how
much
will
you
let
me
sleep
one
night
in
your
box
said
the
captain
no
money
at
all
would
i
do
such
a
thing
said
the
hag
ten
guineas
said
the
captain
for
ten
guineas
said
the
hag
twelve
guineas
said
the
captain
for
twelve
guineas
said
the
hag
fifteen
guineas
said
the
captain
fifteen
i
will
do
it
said
the
hag
then
she
took
him
up
and
hid
him
in
the
box
when
night
came
the
lady
walked
up
into
her
room
and
the
captain
watched
her
through
a
hole
that
was
in
the
box
he
saw
her
take
off
her
two
rings
and
put
them
on
a
kind
of
a
board
that
was
over
her
head
like
a
and
take
off
her
clothes
except
her
shift
and
go
up
into
her
bed
as
soon
as
she
was
asleep
the
captain
came
out
of
his
box
and
he
had
some
means
of
making
a
light
for
he
lit
the
candle
he
went
over
to
the
bed
where
she
was
sleeping
without
disturbing
her
at
all
or
doing
any
bad
thing
and
he
took
the
two
rings
off
the
board
and
blew
out
the
light
and
went
down
again
into
the
box
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
rose
from
the
men
and
women
who
had
crowded
in
while
the
story
was
going
on
till
the
kitchen
was
filled
with
people
as
the
captain
was
coming
out
of
his
box
the
girls
who
had
appeared
to
know
no
english
stopped
their
spinning
and
held
their
breath
with
expectation
the
old
man
went
on
when
came
back
the
captain
met
him
and
told
him
that
he
had
been
a
night
in
his
wife
room
and
gave
him
the
two
rings
gave
him
the
twenty
guineas
of
the
bet
then
he
went
up
into
the
castle
and
he
took
his
wife
up
to
look
out
of
the
window
over
the
wild
ocean
while
she
was
looking
he
pushed
her
from
behind
and
she
fell
down
over
the
cliff
into
the
sea
an
old
woman
was
on
the
shore
and
she
saw
her
falling
she
went
down
then
to
the
surf
and
pulled
her
out
all
wet
and
in
great
disorder
and
she
took
the
wet
clothes
off
her
and
put
on
some
old
rags
belonging
to
herself
when
had
pushed
his
wife
from
the
window
he
went
away
into
the
land
after
a
while
the
lady
went
out
searching
for
him
and
when
she
had
gone
here
and
there
a
long
time
in
the
country
she
heard
that
he
was
reaping
in
a
field
with
sixty
men
she
came
to
the
field
and
she
wanted
to
go
in
but
the
would
not
open
the
gate
for
her
then
the
owner
came
by
and
she
told
him
her
story
he
brought
her
in
and
her
husband
was
there
reaping
but
he
never
gave
any
sign
of
knowing
her
she
showed
him
to
the
owner
and
he
made
the
man
come
out
and
go
with
his
wife
then
the
lady
took
him
out
on
the
road
where
there
were
horses
and
they
rode
away
when
they
came
to
the
place
where
had
met
the
little
man
he
was
there
on
the
road
before
them
you
my
gold
on
you
said
the
man
have
not
said
you
pay
me
the
flesh
off
your
body
said
the
man
they
went
into
a
house
and
a
knife
was
brought
and
a
clean
white
cloth
was
put
on
the
table
and
was
put
upon
the
cloth
then
the
little
man
was
going
to
strike
the
lancet
into
him
when
says
lady
you
bargained
for
five
pounds
of
flesh
five
pounds
of
flesh
said
the
man
you
bargained
for
any
drop
of
his
blood
said
lady
no
blood
said
the
man
out
the
flesh
said
lady
if
you
spill
one
drop
of
his
blood
i
put
that
through
you
and
she
put
a
pistol
to
his
head
the
little
man
went
away
and
they
saw
no
more
of
him
when
they
got
home
to
their
castle
they
made
a
great
supper
and
they
invited
the
captain
and
the
old
hag
and
the
old
woman
that
had
pulled
the
lady
out
of
the
sea
after
they
had
eaten
well
the
lady
began
and
she
said
they
would
all
tell
their
stories
then
she
told
how
she
had
been
saved
from
the
sea
and
how
she
had
found
her
husband
then
the
old
woman
told
her
story
the
way
she
had
found
the
lady
wet
and
in
great
disorder
and
had
brought
her
in
and
put
on
her
some
old
rags
of
her
own
the
lady
asked
the
captain
for
his
story
but
he
said
they
would
get
no
story
from
him
then
she
took
her
pistol
out
of
her
pocket
and
she
put
it
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
she
said
that
any
one
that
would
not
tell
his
story
would
get
a
bullet
into
him
then
the
captain
told
the
way
he
had
got
into
the
box
and
come
over
to
her
bed
without
touching
her
at
all
and
had
taken
away
the
rings
then
the
lady
took
the
pistol
and
shot
the
hag
through
the
body
and
they
threw
her
over
the
cliff
into
the
sea
that
is
my
story
it
gave
me
a
strange
feeling
of
wonder
to
hear
this
illiterate
native
of
a
wet
rock
in
the
atlantic
telling
a
story
that
is
so
full
of
european
associations
the
incident
of
the
faithful
wife
takes
us
beyond
cymbeline
to
the
sunshine
on
the
arno
and
the
gay
company
who
went
out
from
florence
to
tell
narratives
of
love
it
takes
us
again
to
the
low
vineyards
of
wurzburg
on
the
main
where
the
same
tale
was
told
in
the
middle
ages
of
the
merchants
and
the
faithful
wife
of
ruprecht
von
wurzburg
the
other
portion
dealing
with
the
pound
of
flesh
has
a
still
wider
distribution
reaching
from
persia
and
egypt
to
the
gesta
rornanorum
and
the
pecorone
of
ser
giovanni
a
florentine
notary
the
present
union
of
the
two
tales
has
already
been
found
among
the
gaels
and
there
is
a
somewhat
similar
version
in
campbell
popular
tales
of
the
western
highlands
michael
walks
so
fast
when
i
am
out
with
him
that
i
can
not
pick
my
steps
and
the
fossils
which
abound
in
the
limestone
have
cut
my
shoes
to
pieces
the
family
held
a
consultation
on
them
last
night
and
in
the
end
it
was
decided
to
make
me
a
pair
of
pampooties
which
i
have
been
wearing
among
the
rocks
they
consist
simply
of
a
piece
of
raw
cowskin
with
the
hair
outside
laced
over
the
toe
and
round
the
heel
with
two
ends
of
that
work
round
and
are
tied
above
the
instep
in
the
evening
when
they
are
taken
off
they
are
placed
in
a
basin
of
water
as
the
rough
hide
cuts
the
foot
and
stocking
if
it
is
allowed
to
harden
for
the
same
reason
the
people
often
step
into
the
surf
during
the
day
so
that
their
feet
are
continually
moist
at
first
i
threw
my
weight
upon
my
heels
as
one
does
naturally
in
a
boot
and
was
a
good
deal
bruised
but
after
a
few
hours
i
learned
the
natural
walk
of
man
and
could
follow
my
guide
in
any
portion
of
the
island
in
one
district
below
the
cliffs
towards
the
north
one
goes
for
nearly
a
mile
jumping
from
one
rock
to
another
without
a
single
ordinary
step
and
here
i
realized
that
toes
have
a
natural
use
for
i
found
myself
jumping
towards
any
tiny
crevice
in
the
rock
before
me
and
clinging
with
an
eager
grip
in
which
all
the
muscles
of
my
feet
ached
from
their
exertion
the
absence
of
the
heavy
boot
of
europe
has
preserved
to
these
people
the
agile
walk
of
the
wild
animal
while
the
general
simplicity
of
their
lives
has
given
them
many
other
points
of
physical
perfection
their
way
of
life
has
never
been
acted
on
by
anything
much
more
artificial
than
the
nests
and
burrows
of
the
creatures
that
live
round
them
and
they
seem
in
a
certain
sense
to
approach
more
nearly
to
the
finer
types
of
our
aristocracies
who
are
bred
artificially
to
a
natural
ideal
than
to
the
labourer
or
citizen
as
the
wild
horse
resembles
the
thoroughbred
rather
than
the
hack
or
tribes
of
the
same
natural
development
are
perhaps
frequent
in
countries
but
here
a
touch
of
the
refinement
of
old
societies
is
blended
with
singular
effect
among
the
qualities
of
the
wild
animal
while
i
am
walking
with
michael
some
one
often
comes
to
me
to
ask
the
time
of
day
few
of
the
people
however
are
sufficiently
used
to
modern
time
to
understand
in
more
than
a
vague
way
the
convention
of
the
hours
and
when
i
tell
them
what
it
is
by
my
watch
they
are
not
satisfied
and
ask
how
long
is
left
them
before
the
twilight
the
general
knowledge
of
time
on
the
island
depends
curiously
enough
on
the
direction
of
the
wind
nearly
all
the
cottages
are
built
like
this
one
with
two
doors
opposite
each
other
the
more
sheltered
of
which
lies
open
all
day
to
give
light
to
the
interior
if
the
wind
is
northerly
the
south
door
is
opened
and
the
shadow
of
the
moving
across
the
kitchen
floor
indicates
the
hour
as
soon
however
as
the
wind
changes
to
the
south
the
other
door
is
opened
and
the
people
who
never
think
of
putting
up
a
primitive
dial
are
at
a
loss
this
system
of
doorways
has
another
curious
result
it
usually
happens
that
all
the
doors
on
one
side
of
the
village
pathway
are
lying
open
with
women
sitting
about
on
the
thresholds
while
on
the
other
side
the
doors
are
shut
and
there
is
no
sign
of
life
the
moment
the
wind
changes
everything
is
reversed
and
sometimes
when
i
come
back
to
the
village
after
an
hour
walk
there
seems
to
have
been
a
general
flight
from
one
side
of
the
way
to
the
other
in
my
own
cottage
the
change
of
the
doors
alters
the
whole
tone
of
the
kitchen
turning
it
from
a
room
looking
out
on
a
yard
and
laneway
to
a
sombre
cell
with
a
superb
view
of
the
sea
when
the
wind
is
from
the
north
the
old
woman
manages
my
meals
with
fair
regularity
but
on
the
other
days
she
often
makes
my
tea
at
three
instead
of
six
if
i
refuse
it
she
puts
it
down
to
simmer
for
three
hours
in
the
turf
and
then
brings
it
in
at
six
full
of
anxiety
to
know
if
it
is
warm
enough
the
old
man
is
suggesting
that
i
should
send
him
a
clock
when
i
go
away
he
like
to
have
something
from
me
in
the
house
he
says
the
way
they
would
forget
me
and
would
a
clock
be
as
handy
as
another
thing
and
they
be
thinking
of
me
whenever
they
look
on
its
face
the
general
ignorance
of
any
precise
hours
in
the
day
makes
it
impossible
for
the
people
to
have
regular
meals
they
seem
to
eat
together
in
the
evening
and
sometimes
in
the
morning
a
little
after
dawn
before
they
scatter
for
their
work
but
during
the
day
they
simply
drink
a
cup
of
tea
and
eat
a
piece
of
bread
or
some
potatoes
whenever
they
are
hungry
for
men
who
live
in
the
open
air
they
eat
strangely
little
often
when
michael
has
been
out
weeding
potatoes
for
eight
or
nine
hours
without
food
he
comes
in
and
eats
a
few
slices
of
bread
and
then
he
is
ready
to
go
out
with
me
and
wander
for
hours
about
the
island
they
use
no
animal
food
except
a
little
bacon
and
salt
fish
the
old
woman
says
she
would
be
very
ill
if
she
ate
fresh
meat
some
years
ago
before
tea
sugar
and
flour
had
come
into
general
use
salt
fish
was
much
more
the
staple
article
of
diet
than
at
present
and
i
am
told
skin
diseases
were
very
common
though
they
are
now
rare
on
the
islands
no
one
who
has
not
lived
for
weeks
among
these
grey
clouds
and
seas
can
realise
the
joy
with
which
the
eye
rests
on
the
red
dresses
of
the
women
especially
when
a
number
of
them
are
to
be
found
together
as
happened
early
this
morning
i
heard
that
the
young
cattle
were
to
be
shipped
for
a
fair
on
the
mainland
which
is
to
take
place
in
a
few
days
and
i
went
down
on
the
pier
a
little
after
dawn
to
watch
them
the
bay
was
shrouded
in
the
greys
of
coming
rain
yet
the
thinness
of
the
cloud
threw
a
silvery
light
on
the
sea
and
an
unusual
depth
of
blue
to
the
mountains
of
connemara
as
i
was
going
across
the
sandhills
one
hooker
glided
slowly
out
to
begin
her
voyage
and
another
beat
up
to
the
pier
troops
of
red
cattle
driven
mostly
by
the
women
were
coming
up
from
several
directions
forming
with
the
green
of
the
long
tract
of
grass
that
separates
the
sea
from
the
rocks
a
new
unity
of
colour
the
pier
itself
was
crowded
with
bullocks
and
a
great
number
of
the
people
i
noticed
one
extraordinary
girl
in
the
throng
who
seemed
to
exert
an
authority
on
all
who
came
near
her
her
nostrils
and
narrow
chin
gave
her
a
expression
yet
the
beauty
of
her
hair
and
skin
made
her
singularly
attractive
when
the
empty
hooker
was
made
fast
its
deck
was
still
many
feet
below
the
level
of
the
pier
so
the
animals
were
slung
down
by
a
rope
from
the
with
much
struggling
and
confusion
some
of
them
made
wild
efforts
to
escape
nearly
carrying
their
owners
with
them
into
the
sea
but
they
were
handled
with
wonderful
dexterity
and
there
was
no
mishap
when
the
open
hold
was
filled
with
young
cattle
packed
as
tightly
as
they
could
stand
the
owners
with
their
wives
or
sisters
who
go
with
them
to
prevent
extravagance
in
galway
jumped
down
on
the
deck
and
the
voyage
was
begun
immediately
afterwards
a
rickety
old
hooker
beat
up
with
turf
from
connemara
and
while
she
was
unlading
all
the
men
sat
along
the
edge
of
the
pier
and
made
remarks
upon
the
rottenness
of
her
timber
till
the
owners
grew
wild
with
rage
the
tide
was
now
too
low
for
more
boats
to
come
to
the
pier
so
a
move
was
made
to
a
strip
of
sand
towards
the
where
the
rest
of
the
cattle
were
shipped
through
the
surf
here
the
hooker
was
anchored
about
eighty
yards
from
the
shore
and
a
curagh
was
rowed
round
to
tow
out
the
animals
each
bullock
was
caught
in
its
turn
and
girded
with
a
sling
of
rope
by
which
it
could
be
hoisted
on
board
another
rope
was
fastened
to
the
horns
and
passed
out
to
a
man
in
the
stem
of
the
curagh
then
the
animal
was
forced
down
through
the
surf
and
out
of
its
depth
before
it
had
much
time
to
struggle
once
fairly
swimming
it
was
towed
out
to
the
hooker
and
dragged
on
board
in
a
condition
the
freedom
of
the
sand
seemed
to
give
a
stronger
spirit
of
revolt
and
some
of
the
animals
were
only
caught
after
a
dangerous
struggle
the
first
attempt
was
not
always
successful
and
i
saw
one
lift
two
men
with
his
horns
and
drag
another
fifty
yards
along
the
sand
by
his
tail
before
he
was
subdued
while
this
work
was
going
on
a
crowd
of
girls
and
women
collected
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
kept
shouting
down
a
confused
babble
of
satire
and
praise
when
i
came
back
to
the
cottage
i
found
that
among
the
women
who
had
gone
to
the
mainland
was
a
daughter
of
the
old
woman
and
that
her
baby
of
about
nine
months
had
been
left
in
the
care
of
its
grandmother
as
i
came
in
she
was
busy
getting
ready
my
dinner
and
old
pat
dirane
who
usually
comes
at
this
hour
was
rocking
the
cradle
it
is
made
of
clumsy
with
two
pieces
of
rough
wood
fastened
underneath
to
serve
as
rockers
and
all
the
time
i
am
in
my
room
i
can
hear
it
bumping
on
the
floor
with
extraordinary
violence
when
the
baby
is
awake
it
sprawls
on
the
floor
and
the
old
woman
sings
it
a
variety
of
inarticulate
lullabies
that
have
much
musical
charm
another
daughter
who
lives
at
home
has
gone
to
the
fair
also
so
the
old
woman
has
both
the
baby
and
myself
to
take
care
of
as
well
as
a
crowd
of
chickens
that
live
in
a
hole
beside
the
fire
often
when
i
want
tea
or
when
the
old
woman
goes
for
water
i
have
to
take
my
own
turn
at
rocking
the
cradle
one
of
the
largest
duns
or
pagan
forts
on
the
islands
is
within
a
stone
throw
of
my
cottage
and
i
often
stroll
up
there
after
a
dinner
of
eggs
or
salt
pork
to
smoke
drowsily
on
the
stones
the
neighbours
know
my
habit
and
not
infrequently
some
one
wanders
up
to
ask
what
news
there
is
in
the
last
paper
i
have
received
or
to
make
inquiries
about
the
american
war
if
no
one
comes
i
prop
my
book
open
with
stones
touched
by
the
and
sleep
for
hours
in
the
delicious
warmth
of
the
sun
the
last
few
days
i
have
almost
lived
on
the
round
walls
for
by
some
miscalculation
our
turf
has
come
to
an
end
and
the
fires
are
kept
up
with
dried
a
common
fuel
on
the
island
the
smoke
from
which
filters
through
into
my
room
and
lies
in
blue
layers
above
my
table
and
bed
fortunately
the
weather
is
fine
and
i
can
spend
my
days
in
the
sunshine
when
i
look
round
from
the
top
of
these
walls
i
can
see
the
sea
on
nearly
every
side
stretching
away
to
distant
ranges
of
mountains
on
the
north
and
south
underneath
me
to
the
east
there
is
the
one
inhabited
district
of
the
island
where
i
can
see
red
figures
moving
about
the
cottages
sending
up
an
occasional
fragment
of
conversation
or
of
old
island
melodies
the
baby
is
teething
and
has
been
crying
for
several
days
since
his
mother
went
to
the
fair
they
have
been
feeding
him
with
milk
often
slightly
sour
and
giving
him
i
think
more
than
he
requires
this
morning
however
he
seemed
so
unwell
they
sent
out
to
look
for
a
in
the
village
and
before
long
a
young
woman
who
lives
a
little
way
to
the
east
came
in
and
restored
him
to
his
natural
food
a
few
hours
later
when
i
came
into
the
kitchen
to
talk
to
old
pat
another
woman
performed
the
same
kindly
office
this
time
a
person
with
a
curiously
whimsical
expression
pat
told
me
a
story
of
an
unfaithful
wife
which
i
will
give
further
down
and
then
broke
into
a
moral
dispute
with
the
visitor
which
caused
immense
delight
to
some
young
men
who
had
come
down
to
listen
to
the
story
unfortunately
it
was
carried
on
so
rapidly
in
gaelic
that
i
lost
most
of
the
points
this
old
man
talks
usually
in
a
mournful
tone
about
his
and
his
death
which
he
feels
to
be
approaching
yet
he
has
occasional
touches
of
humor
that
remind
me
of
old
mourteen
on
the
north
island
a
grotesque
twopenny
doll
was
lying
on
the
floor
near
the
old
woman
he
picked
it
up
and
examined
it
as
if
comparing
it
with
her
then
he
held
it
up
it
you
is
after
bringing
that
thing
into
the
world
he
said
of
the
house
here
is
the
story
one
day
i
was
travelling
on
foot
from
galway
to
dublin
and
the
darkness
came
on
me
and
i
ten
miles
from
the
town
i
was
wanting
to
pass
the
night
in
then
a
hard
rain
began
to
fall
and
i
was
tired
walking
so
when
i
saw
a
sort
of
a
house
with
no
roof
on
it
up
against
the
road
i
got
in
the
way
the
walls
would
give
me
shelter
as
i
was
looking
round
i
saw
a
light
in
some
trees
two
perches
off
and
thinking
any
sort
of
a
house
would
be
better
than
where
i
was
i
got
over
a
wall
and
went
up
to
the
house
to
look
in
at
the
window
i
saw
a
dead
man
laid
on
a
table
and
candles
lighted
and
a
woman
watching
him
i
was
frightened
when
i
saw
him
but
it
was
raining
hard
and
i
said
to
myself
if
he
was
dead
he
could
hurt
me
then
i
knocked
on
the
door
and
the
woman
came
and
opened
it
evening
says
i
evening
kindly
stranger
says
she
in
out
of
the
rain
then
she
took
me
in
and
told
me
her
husband
was
after
dying
on
her
and
she
was
watching
him
that
night
it
thirsty
you
be
stranger
says
she
into
the
parlour
then
she
took
me
into
the
parlour
and
it
was
a
fine
clean
house
and
she
put
a
cup
with
a
saucer
under
it
on
the
table
before
me
with
fine
sugar
and
bread
when
i
had
a
cup
of
tea
i
went
back
into
the
kitchen
where
the
dead
man
was
lying
and
she
gave
me
a
fine
new
pipe
off
the
table
with
a
drop
of
spirits
says
she
you
be
afeard
to
be
alone
with
himself
a
bit
in
the
world
says
i
that
dead
can
do
no
hurt
then
she
said
she
wanted
to
go
over
and
tell
the
neighbours
the
way
her
husband
was
after
dying
on
her
and
she
went
out
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
i
smoked
one
pipe
and
i
leaned
out
and
took
another
off
the
table
i
was
smoking
it
with
my
hand
on
the
back
of
my
chair
the
way
you
are
yourself
this
minute
god
bless
you
and
i
looking
on
the
dead
man
when
he
opened
his
eyes
as
wide
as
myself
and
looked
at
me
be
afraid
stranger
said
the
dead
man
not
dead
at
all
in
the
world
come
here
and
help
me
up
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
well
i
went
up
and
took
the
sheet
off
of
him
and
i
saw
that
he
had
a
fine
clean
shirt
on
his
body
and
fine
flannel
drawers
he
sat
up
then
and
says
he
got
a
bad
wife
stranger
and
i
let
on
to
be
dead
the
way
catch
her
goings
on
then
he
got
two
fine
sticks
he
had
to
keep
down
his
wife
and
he
put
them
at
each
side
of
his
body
and
he
laid
himself
out
again
as
if
he
was
dead
in
half
an
hour
his
wife
came
back
and
a
young
man
along
with
her
well
she
gave
him
his
tea
and
she
told
him
he
was
tired
and
he
would
do
right
to
go
and
lie
down
in
the
bedroom
the
young
man
went
in
and
the
woman
sat
down
to
watch
by
the
dead
man
a
while
after
she
got
up
and
says
she
going
in
to
get
the
candle
out
of
the
room
i
thinking
the
young
man
will
be
asleep
by
this
time
she
went
into
the
bedroom
but
the
divil
a
bit
of
her
came
back
then
the
dead
man
got
up
and
he
took
one
stick
and
he
gave
the
other
to
myself
we
went
in
and
saw
them
lying
together
with
her
head
on
his
arm
the
dead
man
hit
him
a
blow
with
the
stick
so
that
the
blood
out
of
him
leapt
up
and
hit
the
gallery
that
is
my
story
in
stories
of
this
kind
he
always
speaks
in
the
first
person
with
minute
details
to
show
that
he
was
actually
present
at
the
scenes
that
are
described
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
he
gave
me
a
long
account
of
what
had
made
him
be
on
his
way
to
dublin
on
that
occasion
and
told
me
about
all
the
rich
people
he
was
going
to
see
in
the
finest
streets
of
the
city
a
week
of
sweeping
fogs
has
passed
over
and
given
me
a
strange
sense
of
exile
and
desolation
i
walk
round
the
island
nearly
every
day
yet
i
can
see
nothing
anywhere
but
a
mass
of
wet
rock
a
strip
of
surf
and
then
a
tumult
of
waves
the
slaty
limestone
has
grown
black
with
the
water
that
is
dripping
on
it
and
wherever
i
turn
there
is
the
same
grey
obsession
twining
and
wreathing
itself
among
the
narrow
fields
and
the
same
wail
from
the
wind
that
shrieks
and
whistles
in
the
loose
rubble
of
the
walls
at
first
the
people
do
not
give
much
attention
to
the
wilderness
that
is
round
them
but
after
a
few
days
their
voices
sink
in
the
kitchen
and
their
endless
talk
of
pigs
and
cattle
falls
to
the
whisper
of
men
who
are
telling
stories
in
a
haunted
house
the
rain
continues
but
this
evening
a
number
of
young
men
were
in
the
kitchen
mending
nets
and
the
bottle
of
poteen
was
drawn
from
its
one
can
not
think
of
these
people
drinking
wine
on
the
summit
of
this
crumbling
precipice
but
their
grey
poteen
which
brings
a
shock
of
joy
to
the
blood
seems
predestined
to
keep
sanity
in
men
who
live
forgotten
in
these
worlds
of
mist
i
sat
in
the
kitchen
part
of
the
evening
to
feel
the
gaiety
that
was
rising
and
when
i
came
into
my
own
room
after
dark
one
of
the
sons
came
in
every
time
the
bottle
made
its
round
to
pour
me
out
my
share
it
has
cleared
and
the
sun
is
shining
with
a
luminous
warmth
that
makes
the
whole
island
glisten
with
the
splendor
of
a
gem
and
fills
the
sea
and
sky
with
a
radiance
of
blue
light
i
have
come
out
to
lie
on
the
rocks
where
i
have
the
black
edge
of
the
north
island
in
front
of
me
galway
bay
too
blue
almost
to
look
at
on
my
right
the
atlantic
on
my
left
a
perpendicular
cliff
under
my
ankles
and
over
me
innumerable
gulls
that
chase
each
other
in
a
white
cirrus
of
wings
a
nest
of
hooded
crows
is
somewhere
near
me
and
one
of
the
old
birds
is
trying
to
drive
me
away
by
letting
itself
fall
like
a
stone
every
few
moments
from
about
forty
yards
above
me
to
within
reach
of
my
hand
gannets
are
passing
up
and
down
above
the
sound
swooping
at
times
after
a
mackerel
and
further
off
i
can
see
the
whole
fleet
of
hookers
coming
out
from
kilronan
for
a
night
fishing
in
the
deep
water
to
the
west
as
i
lie
here
hour
after
hour
i
seem
to
enter
into
the
wild
pastimes
of
the
cliff
and
to
become
a
companion
of
the
cormorants
and
crows
many
of
the
birds
display
themselves
before
me
with
the
vanity
of
barbarians
performing
in
strange
evolutions
as
long
as
i
am
in
sight
and
returning
to
their
ledge
of
rock
when
i
am
gone
some
are
wonderfully
expert
and
cut
graceful
figures
for
an
inconceivable
time
without
a
flap
of
their
wings
growing
so
absorbed
in
their
own
dexterity
that
they
often
collide
with
one
another
in
their
flight
an
incident
always
followed
by
a
wild
outburst
of
abuse
their
language
is
easier
than
gaelic
and
i
seem
to
understand
the
greater
part
of
their
cries
though
i
am
not
able
to
answer
there
is
one
plaintive
note
which
they
take
up
in
the
middle
of
their
usual
babble
with
extraordinary
effect
and
pass
on
from
one
to
another
along
the
cliff
with
a
sort
of
an
inarticulate
wail
as
if
they
remembered
for
an
instant
the
horror
of
the
mist
on
the
low
sheets
of
rock
to
the
east
i
can
see
a
number
of
red
and
grey
figures
hurrying
about
their
work
the
continual
passing
in
this
island
between
the
misery
of
last
night
and
the
splendor
of
seems
to
create
an
affinity
between
the
moods
of
these
people
and
the
moods
of
varying
rapture
and
dismay
that
are
frequent
in
artists
and
in
certain
forms
of
alienation
yet
it
is
only
in
the
intonation
of
a
few
sentences
or
some
old
fragment
of
melody
that
i
catch
the
real
spirit
of
the
island
for
in
general
the
men
sit
together
and
talk
with
endless
iteration
of
the
tides
and
fish
and
of
the
price
of
kelp
in
connemara
after
mass
this
morning
an
old
woman
was
buried
she
lived
in
the
cottage
next
mine
and
more
than
once
before
noon
i
heard
a
faint
echo
keen
i
did
not
go
to
the
wake
for
fear
my
presence
might
jar
upon
the
mourners
but
all
last
evening
i
could
hear
the
strokes
of
a
hammer
in
the
yard
where
in
the
middle
of
a
little
crowd
of
idlers
the
next
of
kin
laboured
slowly
at
the
coffin
before
the
hour
for
the
funeral
poteen
was
served
to
a
number
of
men
who
stood
about
upon
the
road
and
a
portion
was
brought
to
me
in
my
room
then
the
coffin
was
carried
out
sewn
loosely
in
sailcloth
and
held
near
the
ground
by
three
lashed
upon
the
top
as
we
moved
down
to
the
low
eastern
portion
of
the
island
nearly
all
the
men
and
all
the
oldest
women
wearing
petticoats
over
their
heads
came
out
and
joined
in
the
procession
while
the
grave
was
being
opened
the
women
sat
down
among
the
flat
tombstones
bordered
with
a
pale
fringe
of
early
bracken
and
began
the
wild
keen
or
crying
for
the
dead
each
old
woman
as
she
took
her
turn
in
the
leading
recitative
seemed
possessed
for
the
moment
with
a
profound
ecstasy
of
grief
swaying
to
and
fro
and
bending
her
forehead
to
the
stone
before
her
while
she
called
out
to
the
dead
with
a
perpetually
recurring
chant
of
sobs
all
round
the
graveyard
other
wrinkled
women
looking
out
from
under
the
deep
red
petticoats
that
cloaked
them
rocked
themselves
with
the
same
rhythm
and
intoned
the
inarticulate
chant
that
is
sustained
by
all
as
an
accompaniment
the
morning
had
been
beautifully
fine
but
as
they
lowered
the
coffin
into
the
grave
thunder
rumbled
overhead
and
hailstones
hissed
among
the
bracken
in
inishmaan
one
is
forced
to
believe
in
a
sympathy
between
man
and
nature
and
at
this
moment
when
the
thunder
sounded
a
of
extraordinary
grandeur
above
the
voices
of
the
women
i
could
see
the
faces
near
me
stiff
and
drawn
with
emotion
when
the
coffin
was
in
the
grave
and
the
thunder
had
rolled
away
across
the
hills
of
clare
the
keen
broke
out
again
more
passionately
than
before
this
grief
of
the
keen
is
no
personal
complaint
for
the
death
of
one
woman
over
eighty
years
but
seems
to
contain
the
whole
passionate
rage
that
lurks
somewhere
in
every
native
of
the
island
in
this
cry
of
pain
the
inner
consciousness
of
the
people
seems
to
lay
itself
bare
for
an
instant
and
to
reveal
the
mood
of
beings
who
feel
their
isolation
in
the
face
of
a
universe
that
wars
on
them
with
winds
and
seas
they
are
usually
silent
but
in
the
presence
of
death
all
outward
show
of
indifference
or
patience
is
forgotten
and
they
shriek
with
pitiable
despair
before
the
horror
of
the
fate
to
which
they
are
all
doomed
before
they
covered
the
coffin
an
old
man
kneeled
down
by
the
grave
and
repeated
a
simple
prayer
for
the
dead
there
was
an
irony
in
these
words
of
atonement
and
catholic
belief
spoken
by
voices
that
were
still
hoarse
with
the
cries
of
pagan
desperation
a
little
beyond
the
grave
i
saw
a
line
of
old
women
who
had
recited
in
the
keen
sitting
in
the
shadow
of
a
wall
beside
the
roofless
shell
of
the
church
they
were
still
sobbing
and
shaken
with
grief
yet
they
were
beginning
to
talk
again
of
the
daily
trifles
that
veil
from
them
the
terror
of
the
world
when
we
had
all
come
out
of
the
graveyard
and
two
men
had
rebuilt
the
hole
in
the
wall
through
which
the
coffin
had
been
carried
in
we
walked
back
to
the
village
talking
of
anything
and
joking
of
anything
as
if
merely
coming
from
the
or
the
pier
one
man
told
me
of
the
poteen
drinking
that
takes
place
at
some
funerals
while
since
he
said
were
two
men
fell
down
in
the
graveyard
while
the
drink
was
on
them
the
sea
was
rough
that
day
the
way
no
one
could
go
to
bring
the
doctor
and
one
of
the
men
never
woke
again
and
found
death
that
night
the
other
day
the
men
of
this
house
made
a
new
field
there
was
a
slight
bank
of
earth
under
the
wall
of
the
yard
and
another
in
the
corner
of
the
cabbage
garden
the
old
man
and
his
eldest
son
dug
out
the
clay
with
the
care
of
men
working
in
a
and
michael
packed
it
in
panniers
there
are
no
wheeled
vehicles
on
this
island
for
transport
to
a
flat
rock
in
a
sheltered
corner
of
their
holding
where
it
was
mixed
with
sand
and
seaweed
and
spread
out
in
a
layer
upon
the
stone
most
of
the
of
the
island
is
carried
on
in
fields
of
this
sort
for
which
the
people
pay
a
considerable
rent
and
if
the
season
is
at
all
dry
their
hope
of
a
fair
crop
is
nearly
always
disappointed
it
is
now
nine
days
since
rain
has
fallen
and
the
people
are
filled
with
anxiety
although
the
sun
has
not
yet
been
hot
enough
to
do
harm
the
drought
is
also
causing
a
scarcity
of
water
there
are
a
few
springs
on
this
side
of
the
island
but
they
come
only
from
a
little
distance
and
in
hot
weather
are
not
to
be
relied
on
the
supply
for
this
house
is
carried
up
in
a
by
one
of
the
women
if
it
is
drawn
off
at
once
it
is
not
very
nauseous
but
if
it
has
lain
as
it
often
does
for
some
hours
in
the
barrel
the
smell
colour
and
taste
are
unendurable
the
water
for
washing
is
also
coming
short
and
as
i
walk
round
the
edges
of
the
sea
i
often
come
on
a
girl
with
her
petticoats
tucked
up
round
her
standing
in
a
pool
left
by
the
tide
and
washing
her
flannels
among
the
and
crabs
their
red
bodices
and
white
tapering
legs
make
them
as
beautiful
as
tropical
as
they
stand
in
a
frame
of
seaweeds
against
the
brink
of
the
atlantic
michael
however
is
a
little
uneasy
when
they
are
in
sight
and
i
can
not
pause
to
watch
them
this
habit
of
using
the
sea
water
for
washing
causes
a
good
deal
of
rheumatism
on
the
island
for
the
salt
lies
in
the
clothes
and
keeps
them
continually
moist
the
people
have
taken
advantage
of
this
dry
moment
to
begin
the
burning
of
the
kelp
and
all
the
islands
are
lying
in
a
volume
of
grey
smoke
there
will
not
be
a
very
large
quantity
this
year
as
the
people
are
discouraged
by
the
uncertainty
of
the
market
and
do
not
care
to
undertake
the
task
of
manufacture
without
a
certainty
of
profit
the
work
needed
to
form
a
ton
of
kelp
is
considerable
the
seaweed
is
collected
from
the
rocks
after
the
storms
of
autumn
and
winter
dried
on
fine
days
and
then
made
up
into
a
rick
where
it
is
left
till
the
beginning
of
june
it
is
then
burnt
in
low
kilns
on
the
shore
an
affair
that
takes
from
twelve
to
hours
of
continuous
hard
work
though
i
understand
the
people
here
do
not
manage
well
and
spoil
a
portion
of
what
they
produce
by
burning
it
more
than
is
required
the
kiln
holds
about
two
tons
of
molten
kelp
and
when
full
it
is
loosely
covered
with
stones
and
left
to
cool
in
a
few
days
the
substance
is
as
hard
as
the
limestone
and
has
to
be
broken
with
crowbars
before
it
can
be
placed
in
curaghs
for
transport
to
kilronan
where
it
is
tested
to
determine
the
amount
of
iodine
contained
and
paid
for
accordingly
in
former
years
good
kelp
would
bring
seven
pounds
a
ton
now
four
pounds
are
not
always
reached
in
aran
even
manufacture
is
of
interest
the
low
kiln
sending
out
dense
clouds
of
creamy
smoke
with
a
band
of
red
and
grey
clothed
workers
moving
in
the
haze
and
usually
some
petticoated
boys
and
women
who
come
down
with
drink
forms
a
scene
with
as
much
variety
and
colour
as
any
picture
from
the
east
the
men
feel
in
a
certain
sense
the
distinction
of
their
island
and
show
me
their
work
with
pride
one
of
them
said
to
me
yesterday
thinking
you
never
saw
the
like
of
this
work
before
this
day
is
true
i
answered
never
did
then
he
said
it
a
great
wonder
that
you
seen
france
and
germany
and
the
holy
father
and
never
seen
a
man
making
kelp
till
you
come
to
inishmaan
all
the
horses
from
this
island
are
put
out
on
grass
among
the
hills
of
connemara
from
june
to
the
end
of
september
as
there
is
no
grazing
here
during
the
summer
their
shipping
and
transport
is
even
more
difficult
than
that
of
the
homed
cattle
most
of
them
are
wild
connemara
ponies
and
their
great
strength
and
timidity
make
them
hard
to
handle
on
the
narrow
pier
while
in
the
hooker
itself
it
is
not
easy
to
get
them
safely
on
their
feet
in
the
small
space
that
is
available
they
are
dealt
with
in
the
same
way
as
for
the
bullocks
i
have
spoken
of
already
but
the
excitement
becomes
much
more
intense
and
the
storm
of
gaelic
that
rises
the
moment
a
horse
is
shoved
from
the
pier
till
it
is
safely
in
its
place
is
indescribable
twenty
boys
and
men
howl
and
scream
with
agitation
cursing
and
exhorting
without
knowing
most
of
the
time
what
they
are
saying
apart
however
from
this
primitive
babble
the
dexterity
and
power
of
the
men
are
displayed
to
more
advantage
than
in
anything
i
have
seen
hitherto
i
noticed
particularly
the
owner
of
a
hooker
from
the
north
island
that
was
loaded
this
morning
he
seemed
able
to
hold
up
a
horse
by
his
single
weight
when
it
was
swinging
from
the
masthead
and
preserved
a
humorous
calm
even
in
moments
of
the
wildest
excitement
sometimes
a
large
mare
would
come
down
sideways
on
the
backs
of
the
other
horses
and
kick
there
till
the
hold
seemed
to
be
filled
with
a
mass
of
struggling
centaurs
for
the
men
themselves
often
leap
down
to
try
and
save
the
foals
from
injury
the
backs
of
the
horses
put
in
first
are
often
a
good
deal
cut
by
the
shoes
of
the
others
that
arrive
on
top
of
them
but
otherwise
they
do
not
seem
to
be
much
the
worse
and
as
they
are
not
on
their
way
to
a
fair
it
is
not
of
much
consequence
in
what
condition
they
come
to
land
there
is
only
one
bit
and
saddle
in
the
island
which
are
used
by
the
priest
who
rides
from
the
chapel
to
the
pier
when
he
has
held
the
service
on
sunday
the
islanders
themselves
ride
with
a
simple
halter
and
a
stick
yet
sometimes
travel
at
least
in
the
larger
island
at
a
desperate
gallop
as
the
horses
usually
have
panniers
the
rider
sits
sideways
over
the
withers
and
if
the
panniers
are
empty
they
go
at
full
speed
in
this
position
without
anything
to
hold
to
more
than
once
in
aranmor
i
met
a
party
going
out
west
with
empty
panniers
from
kilronan
long
before
they
came
in
sight
i
could
hear
a
clatter
of
hoofs
and
then
a
whirl
of
horses
would
come
round
a
corner
at
full
gallop
with
their
heads
out
utterly
indifferent
to
the
slender
halter
that
is
their
only
check
they
generally
travel
in
single
file
with
a
few
yards
between
them
and
as
there
is
no
traffic
there
is
little
fear
of
an
accident
sometimes
a
woman
and
a
man
ride
together
but
in
this
case
the
man
sits
in
the
usual
position
and
the
woman
sits
sideways
behind
him
and
holds
him
round
the
waist
old
pat
dirane
continues
to
come
up
every
day
to
talk
to
me
and
at
times
i
turn
the
conversation
to
his
experiences
of
the
fairies
he
has
seen
a
good
many
of
them
he
says
in
different
parts
of
the
island
especially
in
the
sandy
districts
north
of
the
slip
they
are
about
a
yard
high
with
caps
like
the
pulled
down
over
their
faces
on
one
occasion
he
saw
them
playing
ball
in
the
evening
just
above
the
slip
and
he
says
i
must
avoid
that
place
in
the
morning
or
after
nightfall
for
fear
they
might
do
me
mischief
he
has
seen
two
women
who
were
with
them
one
a
young
married
woman
the
other
a
girl
the
woman
was
standing
by
a
wall
at
a
spot
he
described
to
me
with
great
care
looking
out
towards
the
north
another
night
he
heard
a
voice
crying
out
in
irish
ta
me
marbh
mother
i
killed
and
in
the
morning
there
was
blood
on
the
wall
of
his
house
and
a
child
in
a
house
not
far
off
was
dead
yesterday
he
took
me
aside
and
said
he
would
tell
me
a
secret
he
had
never
yet
told
to
any
person
in
the
world
a
sharp
needle
he
said
stick
it
in
under
the
collar
of
your
coat
and
not
one
of
them
will
be
able
to
have
power
on
you
iron
is
a
common
talisman
with
barbarians
but
in
this
case
the
idea
of
exquisite
sharpness
was
probably
present
also
and
perhaps
some
feeling
for
the
sanctity
of
the
instrument
of
toil
a
that
is
common
in
brittany
the
fairies
are
more
numerous
in
mayo
than
in
any
other
county
though
they
are
fond
of
certain
districts
in
galway
where
the
following
story
is
said
to
have
taken
place
farmer
was
in
great
distress
as
his
crops
had
failed
and
his
cow
had
died
on
him
one
night
he
told
his
wife
to
make
him
a
fine
new
sack
for
flour
before
the
next
morning
and
when
it
was
finished
he
started
off
with
it
before
the
dawn
that
time
there
was
a
gentleman
who
had
been
taken
by
the
fairies
and
made
an
officer
among
them
and
it
was
often
people
would
see
him
and
him
riding
on
a
white
horse
at
dawn
and
in
the
evening
poor
man
went
down
to
the
place
where
they
used
to
see
the
officer
and
when
he
came
by
on
his
horse
he
asked
the
loan
of
two
hundred
and
a
half
of
flour
for
he
was
in
great
want
officer
called
the
fairies
out
of
a
hole
in
the
rocks
where
they
stored
their
wheat
and
told
them
to
give
the
poor
man
what
he
was
asking
then
he
told
him
to
come
back
and
pay
him
in
a
year
and
rode
away
the
poor
man
got
home
he
wrote
down
the
day
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
that
day
year
he
came
back
and
paid
the
officer
when
he
had
ended
his
story
the
old
man
told
me
that
the
fairies
have
a
tenth
of
all
the
produce
of
the
country
and
make
stores
of
it
in
the
rocks
it
is
a
holy
day
and
i
have
come
up
to
sit
on
the
dun
while
the
people
are
at
mass
a
strange
tranquility
has
come
over
the
island
this
morning
as
happens
sometimes
on
sunday
filling
the
two
circles
of
sea
and
sky
with
the
quiet
of
a
church
the
one
landscape
that
is
here
lends
itself
with
singular
power
to
this
suggestion
of
grey
luminous
cloud
there
is
no
wind
and
no
definite
light
aranmor
seems
to
sleep
upon
a
mirror
and
the
hills
of
connemara
look
so
near
that
i
am
troubled
by
the
width
of
the
bay
that
lies
before
them
touched
this
morning
with
individual
expression
one
sees
sometimes
in
a
lake
on
these
rocks
where
there
is
no
growth
of
vegetable
or
animal
life
all
the
seasons
are
the
same
and
this
june
day
is
so
full
of
autumn
that
i
listen
unconsciously
for
the
rustle
of
dead
leaves
the
first
group
of
men
are
coming
out
of
the
chapel
followed
by
a
crowd
of
women
who
divide
at
the
gate
and
troop
off
in
different
directions
while
the
men
linger
on
the
road
to
gossip
the
silence
is
broken
i
can
hear
far
off
as
if
over
water
a
faint
murmur
of
gaelic
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
came
out
and
i
was
rowed
over
for
a
visit
to
kilronan
as
my
men
were
bringing
round
the
curagh
to
take
me
off
a
headland
near
the
pier
they
struck
a
sunken
rock
and
came
ashore
shipping
a
quantity
of
water
they
plugged
the
hole
with
a
piece
of
sacking
torn
from
a
bag
of
potatoes
they
were
taking
over
for
the
priest
and
we
set
off
with
nothing
but
a
piece
of
torn
canvas
between
us
and
the
atlantic
every
few
hundred
yards
one
of
the
rowers
had
to
stop
and
bail
but
the
hole
did
not
increase
when
we
were
about
half
way
across
the
sound
we
met
a
curagh
coming
towards
us
with
its
sails
set
after
some
shouting
in
gaelic
i
learned
that
they
had
a
packet
of
letters
and
tobacco
for
myself
we
sidled
up
as
near
as
was
possible
with
the
roll
and
my
goods
were
thrown
to
me
wet
with
spray
after
my
weeks
in
inishmaan
kilronan
seemed
an
imposing
centre
of
activity
the
fishermen
of
the
larger
island
are
inclined
to
despise
the
simplicity
of
the
life
here
and
some
of
them
who
were
standing
about
when
i
landed
asked
me
how
at
all
i
passed
my
time
with
no
decent
fishing
to
be
looking
at
i
turned
in
for
a
moment
to
talk
to
the
old
couple
in
the
hotel
and
then
moved
on
to
pay
some
other
visits
in
the
village
later
in
the
evening
i
walked
out
along
the
northern
road
where
i
met
many
of
the
natives
of
the
outlying
villages
who
had
come
down
to
kilronan
for
the
holy
day
and
were
now
wandering
home
in
scattered
groups
the
women
and
girls
when
they
had
no
men
with
them
usually
tried
to
make
fun
with
me
it
tired
you
are
stranger
said
one
girl
i
was
walking
very
slowly
to
pass
the
time
before
my
return
to
the
east
it
is
not
little
girl
i
answered
in
gaelic
is
lonely
i
am
is
my
little
sister
stranger
who
will
give
you
her
arm
and
so
it
went
quiet
as
these
women
are
on
ordinary
occasions
when
two
or
three
of
them
are
gathered
together
in
their
holiday
and
shawls
they
are
as
wild
and
capricious
as
the
women
who
live
in
towns
about
seven
i
got
back
to
kilronan
and
beat
up
my
crew
from
the
near
the
bay
with
their
usual
carelessness
they
had
not
seen
to
the
leak
in
the
curagh
nor
to
an
oar
that
was
losing
the
brace
that
holds
it
to
the
and
we
moved
off
across
the
sound
at
an
absurd
pace
with
a
deepening
pool
at
our
feet
a
superb
evening
light
was
lying
over
the
island
which
made
me
rejoice
at
our
delay
looking
back
there
was
a
golden
haze
behind
the
sharp
edges
of
the
rock
and
a
long
wake
from
the
sun
which
was
making
jewels
of
the
bubbling
left
by
the
oars
the
men
had
had
their
share
of
porter
and
were
unusually
voluble
pointing
out
things
to
me
that
i
had
already
seen
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
make
me
notice
the
oily
smell
of
mackerel
that
was
rising
from
the
waves
they
told
me
that
an
evicting
party
is
coming
to
the
island
tomorrow
morning
and
gave
me
a
long
account
of
what
they
make
and
spend
in
a
year
and
of
their
trouble
with
the
rent
rent
is
hard
enough
for
a
poor
man
said
one
of
them
this
time
we
did
pay
and
they
after
serving
processes
on
every
one
of
us
a
man
will
have
to
pay
his
rent
now
and
a
power
of
money
with
it
for
the
process
and
i
thinking
the
agent
will
have
money
enough
out
of
them
processes
to
pay
for
his
and
his
man
all
the
year
i
asked
afterwards
who
the
island
belonged
to
they
said
always
heard
it
belonged
to
miss
and
she
is
dead
when
the
sun
passed
like
a
lozenge
of
gold
flame
into
the
sea
the
cold
became
intense
then
the
men
began
to
talk
among
themselves
and
losing
the
thread
i
lay
half
in
a
dream
looking
at
the
pale
oily
sea
about
us
and
the
low
cliffs
of
the
island
sloping
up
past
the
village
with
its
wreath
of
smoke
to
the
outline
of
dun
conor
old
pat
was
in
the
house
when
i
arrived
and
he
told
a
long
story
after
supper
there
was
once
a
widow
living
among
the
woods
and
her
only
son
living
along
with
her
he
went
out
every
morning
through
the
trees
to
get
sticks
and
one
day
as
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
he
saw
a
swarm
of
flies
flying
over
what
the
cow
leaves
behind
her
he
took
up
his
sickle
and
hit
one
blow
at
them
and
hit
that
hard
he
left
no
single
one
of
them
living
that
evening
he
said
to
his
mother
that
it
was
time
he
was
going
out
into
the
world
to
seek
his
fortune
for
he
was
able
to
destroy
a
whole
swarm
of
flies
at
one
blow
and
he
asked
her
to
make
him
three
cakes
the
way
he
might
take
them
with
him
in
the
morning
he
started
the
next
day
a
while
after
the
dawn
with
his
three
cakes
in
his
wallet
and
he
ate
one
of
them
near
ten
he
got
hungry
again
by
midday
and
ate
the
second
and
when
night
was
coming
on
him
he
ate
the
third
after
that
he
met
a
man
on
the
road
who
asked
him
where
he
was
going
looking
for
some
place
where
i
can
work
for
my
living
said
the
young
man
with
me
said
the
other
man
sleep
in
the
barn
and
i
give
you
work
to
see
what
you
able
for
the
next
morning
the
farmer
brought
him
out
and
showed
him
his
cows
and
told
him
to
take
them
out
to
graze
on
the
hills
and
to
keep
good
watch
that
no
one
should
come
near
them
to
milk
them
the
young
man
drove
out
the
cows
into
the
fields
and
when
the
heat
of
the
day
came
on
he
lay
down
on
his
back
and
looked
up
into
the
sky
a
while
after
he
saw
a
black
spot
in
the
and
it
grew
larger
and
nearer
till
he
saw
a
great
giant
coming
towards
him
he
got
up
on
his
feet
and
he
caught
the
giant
round
the
legs
with
his
two
arms
and
he
drove
him
down
into
the
hard
ground
above
his
ankles
the
way
he
was
not
able
to
free
himself
then
the
giant
told
him
to
do
him
no
hurt
and
gave
him
his
magic
rod
and
told
him
to
strike
on
the
rock
and
he
would
find
his
beautiful
black
horse
and
his
sword
and
his
fine
suit
the
young
man
struck
the
rock
and
it
opened
before
him
and
he
found
the
beautiful
black
horse
and
the
giant
sword
and
the
suit
lying
before
him
he
took
out
the
sword
alone
and
he
struck
one
blow
with
it
and
struck
off
the
giant
head
then
he
put
back
the
sword
into
the
rock
and
went
out
again
to
his
cattle
till
it
was
time
to
drive
them
home
to
the
farmer
when
they
came
to
milk
the
cows
they
found
a
power
of
milk
in
them
and
the
farmer
asked
the
young
man
if
he
had
seen
nothing
out
on
the
hills
for
the
other
had
been
bringing
home
the
cows
with
no
drop
of
milk
in
them
and
the
young
man
said
he
had
seen
nothing
the
next
day
he
went
out
again
with
the
cows
he
lay
down
on
his
back
in
the
heat
of
the
day
and
after
a
while
he
saw
a
black
spot
in
the
and
it
grew
larger
and
nearer
till
he
saw
it
was
a
great
giant
coming
to
attack
him
killed
my
brother
said
the
giant
here
till
i
make
a
garter
of
your
body
the
young
man
went
to
him
and
caught
him
by
the
legs
and
drove
him
down
into
the
hard
ground
up
to
his
ankles
then
he
hit
the
rod
against
the
rock
and
took
out
the
sword
and
struck
off
the
giant
head
that
evening
the
farmer
found
twice
as
much
milk
in
the
cows
as
the
evening
before
and
he
asked
the
young
man
if
he
had
seen
anything
the
young
man
said
that
he
had
seen
nothing
the
third
day
the
third
giant
came
to
him
and
said
have
killed
my
two
brothers
come
here
till
i
make
a
garter
of
your
body
and
he
did
with
this
giant
as
he
had
done
with
the
other
two
and
that
evening
there
was
so
much
milk
in
the
cows
it
was
dropping
out
of
their
udders
on
the
pathway
the
next
day
the
farmer
called
him
and
told
him
he
might
leave
the
cows
in
the
stalls
that
day
for
there
was
a
great
curiosity
to
be
seen
namely
a
beautiful
king
daughter
that
was
to
be
eaten
by
a
great
fish
if
there
was
no
one
in
it
that
could
save
her
but
the
young
man
said
such
a
sight
was
all
one
to
him
and
he
went
out
with
the
cows
on
to
the
hills
when
he
came
to
the
rocks
he
hit
them
with
his
rod
and
brought
out
the
suit
and
put
it
on
him
and
brought
out
the
sword
and
strapped
it
on
his
side
like
an
officer
and
he
got
on
the
black
horse
and
rode
faster
than
the
wind
till
he
came
to
where
the
beautiful
king
daughter
was
sitting
on
the
shore
in
a
golden
chair
waiting
for
the
great
fish
when
the
great
fish
came
in
on
the
sea
bigger
than
a
whale
with
two
wings
on
the
back
of
it
the
young
man
went
down
into
the
surf
and
struck
at
it
with
his
sword
and
cut
off
one
of
its
wings
all
the
sea
turned
red
with
the
bleeding
out
of
it
till
it
swam
away
and
left
the
young
man
on
the
shore
then
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
faster
than
the
wind
till
he
came
to
the
rocks
and
he
took
the
suit
off
him
and
put
it
back
in
the
rocks
with
the
giant
sword
and
the
black
horse
and
drove
the
cows
down
to
the
farm
the
man
came
out
before
him
and
said
he
had
missed
the
greatest
wonder
ever
was
and
that
a
noble
person
was
after
coming
down
with
a
fine
suit
on
him
and
cutting
off
one
of
the
wings
from
the
great
fish
there
be
the
same
necessity
on
her
for
two
mornings
more
said
the
farmer
you
do
right
to
come
and
look
on
it
but
the
young
man
said
he
would
not
come
the
next
morning
he
went
out
with
his
cows
and
he
took
the
sword
and
the
suit
and
the
black
horse
out
of
the
rock
and
he
rode
faster
than
the
wind
till
he
came
where
the
king
daughter
was
sitting
on
the
shore
when
the
people
saw
him
coming
there
was
great
wonder
on
them
to
know
if
it
was
the
same
man
they
had
seen
the
day
before
the
king
daughter
called
out
to
him
to
come
and
kneel
before
her
and
when
he
kneeled
down
she
took
her
scissors
and
cut
off
a
lock
of
hair
from
the
back
of
his
head
and
hid
it
in
her
clothes
then
the
great
worm
came
in
from
the
sea
and
he
went
down
into
the
surf
and
cut
the
other
wing
off
from
it
all
the
sea
turned
red
with
the
bleeding
out
of
it
till
it
swam
away
and
left
them
that
evening
the
farmer
came
out
before
him
and
told
him
of
the
great
wonder
he
had
missed
and
asked
him
would
he
go
the
next
day
and
look
on
it
the
young
man
said
he
would
not
go
the
third
day
he
came
again
on
the
black
horse
to
where
the
daughter
was
sitting
on
a
golden
chair
waiting
for
the
great
worm
when
it
came
in
from
the
sea
the
young
man
went
down
before
it
and
every
time
it
opened
its
mouth
to
eat
him
he
struck
into
its
mouth
till
his
sword
went
out
through
its
neck
and
it
rolled
back
and
died
then
he
rode
off
faster
than
the
wind
and
he
put
the
suit
and
the
sword
and
the
black
horse
into
the
rock
and
drove
home
the
cows
the
farmer
was
there
before
him
and
he
told
him
that
there
was
to
be
a
great
marriage
feast
held
for
three
days
and
on
the
third
day
the
king
daughter
would
be
married
to
the
man
that
killed
the
great
worm
if
they
were
able
to
find
him
a
great
feast
was
held
and
men
of
great
strength
came
and
said
it
was
themselves
were
after
killing
the
great
worm
but
on
the
third
day
the
young
man
put
on
the
suit
and
strapped
the
sword
to
his
side
like
an
officer
and
got
on
the
black
horse
and
rode
faster
than
the
wind
till
he
came
to
the
palace
the
king
daughter
saw
him
and
she
brought
him
in
and
made
him
kneel
down
before
her
then
she
looked
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
saw
the
place
where
she
had
cut
off
the
lock
with
her
own
hand
she
led
him
in
to
the
king
and
they
were
married
and
the
young
man
was
given
all
the
estate
that
is
my
story
two
recent
attempts
to
carry
out
evictions
on
the
island
came
to
nothing
for
each
time
a
sudden
storm
rose
by
it
is
said
the
power
of
a
native
witch
when
the
steamer
was
approaching
and
made
it
impossible
to
land
this
morning
however
broke
beneath
a
clear
sky
of
june
and
when
i
came
into
the
open
air
the
sea
and
rocks
were
shining
with
wonderful
brilliancy
groups
of
men
dressed
in
their
holiday
clothes
were
standing
about
talking
with
anger
and
fear
yet
showing
a
lurking
satisfaction
at
the
thought
of
the
dramatic
pageant
that
was
to
break
the
silence
of
the
seas
about
nine
the
steamer
came
in
sight
on
the
narrow
line
of
that
is
seen
in
the
centre
of
the
bay
and
immediately
a
last
effort
was
made
to
hide
the
cows
and
sheep
of
the
families
that
were
most
in
debt
till
this
year
no
one
on
the
island
would
consent
to
act
as
bailiff
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
identify
the
cattle
of
the
defaulters
now
however
a
man
of
the
name
of
patrick
has
sold
his
honour
and
the
effort
of
concealment
is
practically
futile
this
falling
away
from
the
ancient
loyalty
of
the
island
has
caused
intense
indignation
and
early
yesterday
morning
while
i
was
dreaming
on
the
dun
this
letter
was
nailed
on
the
doorpost
of
the
chapel
the
devil
a
revolver
is
waiting
for
you
if
you
are
missed
with
the
first
shot
there
will
be
five
more
that
will
hit
you
man
that
will
talk
with
you
or
work
with
you
or
drink
a
pint
of
porter
in
your
shop
will
be
done
with
the
same
way
as
yourself
as
the
steamer
drew
near
i
moved
down
with
the
men
to
watch
the
arrival
though
no
one
went
further
than
about
a
mile
from
the
shore
two
curaghs
from
kilronan
with
a
man
who
was
to
give
help
in
identifying
the
cottages
the
doctor
and
the
relieving
officer
were
drifting
with
the
tide
unwilling
to
come
to
land
without
the
support
of
the
larger
party
when
the
anchor
had
been
thrown
it
gave
me
a
strange
throb
of
pain
to
see
the
boats
being
lowered
and
the
sunshine
gleaming
on
the
rifles
and
helmets
of
the
constabulary
who
crowded
into
them
once
on
shore
the
men
were
formed
in
close
marching
order
a
word
was
given
and
the
heavy
rhythm
of
their
boots
came
up
over
the
rocks
we
were
collected
in
two
straggling
bands
on
either
side
of
the
roadway
and
a
few
moments
later
the
body
of
magnificent
armed
men
passed
close
to
us
followed
by
a
low
rabble
who
had
been
brought
to
act
as
drivers
for
the
sheriff
after
my
weeks
spent
among
primitive
men
this
glimpse
of
the
newer
types
of
humanity
was
not
reassuring
yet
these
mechanical
police
with
the
commonplace
agents
and
sheriffs
and
the
rabble
they
had
hired
represented
aptly
enough
the
civilisation
for
which
the
homes
of
the
island
were
to
be
desecrated
a
stop
was
made
at
one
of
the
first
cottages
in
the
village
and
the
day
work
began
here
however
and
at
the
next
cottage
a
compromise
was
made
as
some
relatives
came
up
at
the
last
moment
and
lent
the
money
that
was
needed
to
gain
a
respite
in
another
case
a
girl
was
ill
in
the
house
so
the
doctor
interposed
and
the
people
were
allowed
to
remain
after
a
merely
formal
eviction
about
midday
however
a
house
was
reached
where
there
was
no
pretext
for
mercy
and
no
money
could
be
procured
at
a
sign
from
the
sheriff
the
work
of
carrying
out
the
beds
and
utensils
was
begun
in
the
middle
of
a
crowd
of
natives
who
looked
on
in
absolute
silence
broken
only
by
the
wild
imprecations
of
the
woman
of
the
house
she
belonged
to
one
of
the
most
primitive
families
on
the
island
and
she
shook
with
uncontrollable
fury
as
she
saw
the
strange
armed
men
who
spoke
a
language
she
could
not
understand
driving
her
from
the
hearth
she
had
brooded
on
for
thirty
years
for
these
people
the
outrage
to
the
hearth
is
the
supreme
catastrophe
they
live
here
in
a
world
of
grey
where
there
are
wild
rains
and
mists
every
week
in
the
year
and
their
warm
chimney
corners
filled
with
children
and
young
girls
grow
into
the
consciousness
of
each
family
in
a
way
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
in
more
civilised
places
the
outrage
to
a
tomb
in
china
probably
gives
no
greater
shock
to
the
chinese
than
the
outrage
to
a
hearth
in
inishmaan
gives
to
the
people
when
the
few
trifles
had
been
carried
out
and
the
door
blocked
with
stones
the
old
woman
sat
down
by
the
threshold
and
covered
her
head
with
her
shawl
five
or
six
other
women
who
lived
close
by
sat
down
in
a
circle
round
her
with
mute
sympathy
then
the
crowd
moved
on
with
the
police
to
another
cottage
where
the
same
scene
was
to
take
place
and
left
the
group
of
desolate
women
sitting
by
the
hovel
there
were
still
no
clouds
in
the
sky
and
the
heat
was
intense
the
police
when
not
in
motion
lay
sweating
and
gasping
under
the
walls
with
their
tunics
unbuttoned
they
were
not
attractive
and
i
kept
comparing
them
with
the
islandmen
who
walked
up
and
down
as
cool
and
as
the
when
the
last
eviction
had
been
carried
out
a
division
was
made
half
the
party
went
off
with
the
bailiff
to
search
the
inner
plain
of
the
island
for
the
cattle
that
had
been
hidden
in
the
morning
the
other
half
remained
on
the
village
road
to
guard
some
pigs
that
had
already
been
taken
possession
of
after
a
while
two
of
these
pigs
escaped
from
the
drivers
and
began
a
wild
race
up
and
down
the
narrow
road
the
people
shrieked
and
howled
to
increase
their
terror
and
at
last
some
of
them
became
so
excited
that
the
police
thought
it
time
to
interfere
they
drew
up
in
double
line
opposite
the
mouth
of
a
blind
laneway
where
the
animals
had
been
shut
up
a
moment
later
the
shrieking
began
again
in
the
west
and
the
two
pigs
came
in
sight
rushing
down
the
middle
of
the
road
with
the
drivers
behind
them
they
reached
the
line
of
the
police
there
was
a
slight
scuffle
and
then
the
pigs
continued
their
mad
rush
to
the
east
leaving
three
policemen
lying
in
the
dust
the
satisfaction
of
the
people
was
immense
they
shrieked
and
hugged
each
other
with
delight
and
it
is
likely
that
they
will
hand
down
these
animals
for
generations
in
the
tradition
of
the
island
two
hours
later
the
other
party
returned
driving
three
lean
cows
before
them
and
a
start
was
made
for
the
slip
at
the
the
policemen
were
given
a
drink
while
the
dense
crowd
that
was
following
waited
in
the
lane
the
island
bull
happened
to
be
in
a
field
close
by
and
he
became
wildly
excited
at
the
sight
of
the
cows
and
of
the
men
two
young
islanders
sidled
up
to
me
in
a
moment
or
two
as
i
was
resting
on
a
wall
and
one
of
them
whispered
in
my
ear
you
think
they
could
take
fines
of
us
if
we
let
out
the
bull
on
them
in
face
of
the
crowd
of
women
and
children
i
could
only
say
it
was
probable
and
they
slunk
off
at
the
slip
there
was
a
good
deal
of
bargaining
which
ended
in
all
the
cattle
being
given
back
to
their
owners
it
was
plainly
of
no
use
to
take
them
away
as
they
were
worth
nothing
when
the
last
policeman
had
embarked
an
old
woman
came
forward
from
the
crowd
and
mounting
on
a
rock
near
the
slip
began
a
fierce
rhapsody
in
gaelic
pointing
at
the
bailiff
and
waving
her
withered
arms
with
extraordinary
rage
man
is
my
own
son
she
said
is
i
that
ought
to
know
him
he
is
the
first
ruffian
in
the
whole
big
world
then
she
gave
an
account
of
his
life
coloured
with
a
vindictive
fury
i
can
not
reproduce
as
she
went
on
the
excitement
became
so
intense
i
thought
the
man
would
be
stoned
before
he
could
get
back
to
his
cottage
on
these
islands
the
women
live
only
for
their
children
and
it
is
hard
to
estimate
the
power
of
the
impulse
that
made
this
old
woman
stand
out
and
curse
her
son
in
the
fury
of
her
speech
i
seem
to
look
again
into
the
strangely
reticent
temperament
of
the
islanders
and
to
feel
the
passionate
spirit
that
expresses
itself
at
odd
moments
only
with
magnificent
words
and
gestures
old
pat
has
told
me
a
story
of
the
goose
that
lays
the
golden
eggs
which
he
calls
the
phoenix
a
poor
widow
had
three
sons
and
a
daughter
one
day
when
her
sons
were
out
looking
for
sticks
in
the
wood
they
saw
a
fine
speckled
bird
flying
in
the
trees
the
next
day
they
saw
it
again
and
the
eldest
son
told
his
brothers
to
go
and
get
sticks
by
themselves
for
he
was
going
after
the
bird
he
went
after
it
and
brought
it
in
with
him
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
they
put
it
in
an
old
hencoop
and
they
gave
it
some
of
the
meal
they
had
for
themselves
i
do
know
if
it
ate
the
meal
but
they
divided
what
they
had
themselves
they
could
do
no
more
that
night
it
laid
a
fine
spotted
egg
in
the
basket
the
next
night
it
laid
another
at
that
time
its
name
was
on
the
papers
and
many
heard
of
the
bird
that
laid
the
golden
eggs
for
the
eggs
were
of
gold
and
there
no
lie
in
it
when
the
boys
went
down
to
the
shop
the
next
day
to
buy
a
stone
of
meal
the
shopman
asked
if
he
could
buy
the
bird
of
them
well
it
was
arranged
in
this
way
the
shopman
would
marry
the
sister
a
poor
simple
girl
without
a
stitch
of
good
clothes
and
get
the
bird
with
her
some
time
after
that
one
of
the
boys
sold
an
egg
of
the
bird
to
a
gentleman
that
was
in
the
country
the
gentleman
asked
him
if
he
had
the
bird
still
he
said
that
the
man
who
had
married
his
sister
was
after
getting
it
said
the
gentleman
man
who
eats
the
heart
of
that
bird
will
find
a
purse
of
gold
beneath
him
every
morning
and
the
man
who
eats
its
liver
will
be
king
of
ireland
the
boy
went
out
he
was
a
simple
poor
fellow
and
told
the
shopman
then
the
shopman
brought
in
the
bird
and
killed
it
and
he
ate
the
heart
himself
and
he
gave
the
liver
to
his
wife
when
the
boy
saw
that
there
was
great
anger
on
him
and
he
went
back
and
told
the
gentleman
what
i
telling
you
said
the
gentleman
down
now
and
tell
the
shopman
and
his
wife
to
come
up
here
to
play
a
game
of
cards
with
me
for
it
lonesome
i
am
this
evening
when
the
boy
was
gone
he
mixed
a
vomit
and
poured
the
lot
of
it
into
a
few
naggins
of
whiskey
and
he
put
a
strong
cloth
on
the
table
under
the
cards
the
man
came
up
with
his
wife
and
they
began
to
play
the
shopman
won
the
first
game
and
the
gentleman
made
them
drink
a
sup
of
the
whiskey
they
played
again
and
the
shopman
won
the
second
game
then
the
gentleman
made
him
drink
a
sup
more
of
the
whiskey
as
they
were
playing
the
third
game
the
shopman
and
his
wife
got
sick
on
the
cloth
and
the
boy
picked
it
up
and
carried
it
into
the
yard
for
the
gentleman
had
let
him
know
what
he
was
to
do
then
he
found
the
heart
of
the
bird
and
he
ate
it
and
the
next
morning
when
he
turned
in
his
bed
there
was
a
purse
of
gold
under
him
that
is
my
story
when
the
steamer
is
expected
i
rarely
fail
to
visit
the
as
the
men
usually
collect
when
she
is
in
the
offing
and
lie
arguing
among
their
curaghs
till
she
has
made
her
visit
to
the
south
island
and
is
seen
coming
towards
us
this
morning
i
had
a
long
talk
with
an
old
man
who
was
rejoicing
over
the
improvement
he
had
seen
here
during
the
last
ten
or
fifteen
years
till
recently
there
was
no
communication
with
the
mainland
except
by
hookers
which
were
usually
slow
and
could
only
make
the
voyage
in
tolerably
fine
weather
so
that
if
an
islander
went
to
a
fair
it
was
often
three
weeks
before
he
could
return
now
however
the
steamer
comes
here
twice
in
the
week
and
the
voyage
is
made
in
three
or
four
hours
the
pier
on
this
island
is
also
a
novelty
and
is
much
thought
of
as
it
enables
the
hookers
that
still
carry
turf
and
cattle
to
discharge
and
take
their
cargoes
directly
from
the
shore
the
water
round
it
however
is
only
deep
enough
for
a
hooker
when
the
tide
is
nearly
full
and
will
never
float
the
steamer
so
passengers
must
still
come
to
land
in
curaghs
the
at
the
corner
next
the
south
island
is
extremely
useful
in
calm
weather
but
it
is
exposed
to
a
heavy
roll
from
the
south
and
is
so
narrow
that
the
curaghs
run
some
danger
of
missing
it
in
the
tumult
of
the
surf
in
bad
weather
four
men
will
often
stand
for
nearly
an
hour
at
the
top
of
the
slip
with
a
curagh
in
their
hands
watching
a
point
of
rock
towards
the
south
where
they
can
see
the
strength
of
the
waves
that
are
coming
in
the
instant
a
break
is
seen
they
swoop
down
to
the
surf
launch
their
curagh
and
pull
out
to
sea
with
incredible
speed
coming
to
land
is
attended
with
the
same
difficulty
and
if
their
moment
is
badly
chosen
they
are
likely
to
be
washed
sideways
and
swamped
among
the
rocks
this
continual
danger
which
can
only
be
escaped
by
extraordinary
personal
dexterity
has
had
considerable
influence
on
the
local
character
as
the
waves
have
made
it
impossible
for
clumsy
foolhardy
or
timid
men
to
live
on
these
islands
when
the
steamer
is
within
a
mile
of
the
slip
the
curaghs
are
put
out
and
range
themselves
there
are
usually
from
four
to
a
dozen
in
two
lines
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
the
moment
she
comes
in
among
them
there
is
a
short
but
desperate
struggle
for
good
places
at
her
side
the
men
are
lolling
on
their
oars
talking
with
the
dreamy
tone
which
comes
with
the
rocking
of
the
waves
the
steamer
lies
to
and
in
an
instant
their
faces
become
distorted
with
passion
while
the
oars
bend
and
quiver
with
the
strain
for
one
minute
they
seem
utterly
indifferent
to
their
own
safety
and
that
of
their
friends
and
brothers
then
the
sequence
is
decided
and
they
begin
to
talk
again
with
the
dreamy
tone
that
is
habitual
to
them
while
they
make
fast
and
clamber
up
into
the
steamer
while
the
curaghs
are
out
i
am
left
with
a
few
women
and
very
old
men
who
can
not
row
one
of
these
old
men
whom
i
often
talk
with
has
some
fame
as
a
and
is
said
to
have
done
remarkable
cures
both
here
and
on
the
mainland
stories
are
told
of
how
he
has
been
taken
off
by
the
quality
in
their
carriages
through
the
hills
of
connemara
to
treat
their
sons
and
daughters
and
come
home
with
his
pockets
full
of
money
another
old
man
the
oldest
on
the
island
is
fond
of
telling
me
anecdotes
not
folktales
of
things
that
have
happened
here
in
his
lifetime
he
often
tells
me
about
a
connaught
man
who
killed
his
father
with
the
blow
of
a
spade
when
he
was
in
passion
and
then
fled
to
this
island
and
threw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
some
of
the
natives
with
whom
he
was
said
to
be
related
they
hid
him
in
a
hole
which
the
old
man
has
shown
me
and
kept
him
safe
for
weeks
though
the
police
came
and
searched
for
him
and
he
could
hear
their
boots
grinding
on
the
stones
over
his
head
in
spite
of
a
reward
which
was
offered
the
island
was
incorruptible
and
after
much
trouble
the
man
was
safely
shipped
to
america
this
impulse
to
protect
the
criminal
is
universal
in
the
west
it
seems
partly
due
to
the
association
between
justice
and
the
hated
english
jurisdiction
but
more
directly
to
the
primitive
feeling
of
these
people
who
are
never
criminals
yet
always
capable
of
crime
that
a
man
will
not
do
wrong
unless
he
is
under
the
influence
of
a
passion
which
is
as
irresponsible
as
a
storm
on
the
sea
if
a
man
has
killed
his
father
and
is
already
sick
and
broken
with
remorse
they
can
see
no
reason
why
he
should
be
dragged
away
and
killed
by
the
law
such
a
man
they
say
will
be
quiet
all
the
rest
of
his
life
and
if
you
suggest
that
punishment
is
needed
as
an
example
they
ask
any
one
kill
his
father
if
he
was
able
to
help
it
some
time
ago
before
the
introduction
of
police
all
the
people
of
the
islands
were
as
innocent
as
the
people
here
remain
to
this
day
i
have
heard
that
at
that
time
the
ruling
proprietor
and
magistrate
of
the
north
island
used
to
give
any
man
who
had
done
wrong
a
letter
to
a
jailer
in
galway
and
send
him
off
by
himself
to
serve
a
term
of
imprisonment
as
there
was
no
steamer
the
was
given
a
passage
in
some
chance
hooker
to
the
nearest
point
on
the
mainland
then
he
walked
for
many
miles
along
a
desolate
shore
till
he
reached
the
town
when
his
time
had
been
put
through
he
crawled
back
along
the
same
route
feeble
and
emaciated
and
had
often
to
wait
many
weeks
before
he
could
regain
the
island
such
at
least
is
the
story
it
seems
absurd
to
apply
the
same
laws
to
these
people
and
to
the
criminal
classes
of
a
city
the
most
intelligent
man
on
inishmaan
has
often
spoken
to
me
of
his
contempt
of
the
law
and
of
the
increase
of
crime
the
police
have
brought
to
aranmor
on
this
island
he
says
if
men
have
a
little
difference
or
a
little
fight
their
friends
take
care
it
does
not
go
too
far
and
in
a
little
time
it
is
forgotten
in
kilronan
there
is
a
band
of
men
paid
to
make
out
cases
for
themselves
the
moment
a
blow
is
struck
they
come
down
and
arrest
the
man
who
gave
it
the
other
man
he
quarreled
with
has
to
give
evidence
against
him
whole
families
come
down
to
the
court
and
swear
against
each
other
till
they
become
bitter
enemies
if
there
is
a
conviction
the
man
who
is
convicted
never
forgives
he
waits
his
time
and
before
the
year
is
out
there
is
a
cross
summons
which
the
other
man
in
turn
never
forgives
the
feud
continues
to
grow
till
a
dispute
about
the
colour
of
a
man
hair
may
end
in
a
murder
after
a
year
forcing
by
the
law
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
reliable
evidence
in
the
island
not
because
the
people
are
dishonest
but
because
they
think
the
claim
of
kinship
more
sacred
than
the
claims
of
abstract
truth
turns
the
whole
system
of
sworn
evidence
into
a
demoralising
farce
and
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
law
dealings
on
this
false
basis
must
lead
to
every
sort
of
injustice
while
i
am
discussing
these
questions
with
the
old
men
the
curaghs
begin
to
come
in
with
cargoes
of
salt
and
flour
and
porter
a
stir
was
made
by
the
return
of
a
native
who
had
spent
five
years
in
new
york
he
came
on
shore
with
half
a
dozen
people
who
had
been
shopping
on
the
mainland
and
walked
up
and
down
on
the
slip
in
his
neat
suit
looking
strangely
foreign
to
his
birthplace
while
his
old
mother
of
ran
about
on
the
slippery
seaweed
half
crazy
with
delight
telling
every
one
the
news
when
the
curaghs
were
in
their
places
the
men
crowded
round
him
to
bid
him
welcome
he
shook
hands
with
them
readily
enough
but
with
no
smile
of
recognition
he
is
said
to
be
dying
yesterday
a
sunday
three
young
men
rowed
me
over
to
inisheer
the
south
island
of
the
group
the
stern
of
the
curagh
was
occupied
so
i
was
put
in
the
bow
with
my
head
on
a
level
with
the
gunnel
a
considerable
sea
was
running
in
the
sound
and
when
we
came
out
from
the
shelter
of
this
island
the
curagh
rolled
and
vaulted
in
a
way
not
easy
to
describe
at
one
moment
as
we
went
down
into
the
furrow
green
waves
curled
and
arched
themselves
above
me
then
in
an
instant
i
was
flung
up
into
the
air
and
could
look
down
on
the
heads
of
the
rowers
as
if
we
were
sitting
on
a
ladder
or
out
across
a
forest
of
white
crests
to
the
black
cliff
of
inishmaan
the
men
seemed
excited
and
uneasy
and
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
we
were
likely
to
be
swamped
in
a
little
while
however
i
realised
the
capacity
of
the
curagh
to
raise
its
head
among
the
waves
and
the
motion
became
strangely
exhilarating
even
i
thought
if
we
were
dropped
into
the
blue
chasm
of
the
waves
this
death
with
the
fresh
sea
saltness
in
one
teeth
would
be
better
than
most
deaths
one
is
likely
to
meet
when
we
reached
the
other
island
it
was
raining
heavily
so
that
we
could
not
see
anything
of
the
antiquities
or
people
for
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
we
sat
on
the
tops
of
empty
barrels
in
the
talking
of
the
destiny
of
gaelic
we
were
admitted
as
travellers
and
the
shutters
of
the
shop
were
closed
behind
us
letting
in
only
a
glimmer
of
grey
light
and
the
tumult
of
the
storm
towards
evening
it
cleared
a
little
and
we
came
home
in
a
calmer
sea
but
with
a
dead
that
gave
the
rowers
all
they
could
do
to
make
the
passage
on
calm
days
i
often
go
out
fishing
with
michael
when
we
reach
the
space
above
the
slip
where
the
curaghs
are
propped
bottom
upwards
on
the
limestone
he
lifts
the
prow
of
the
one
we
are
going
to
embark
in
and
i
slip
underneath
and
set
the
centre
of
the
foremost
seat
upon
my
neck
then
he
crawls
under
the
stern
and
stands
up
with
the
last
seat
upon
his
shoulders
we
start
for
the
sea
the
long
prow
bends
before
me
so
that
i
see
nothing
but
a
few
yards
of
shingle
at
my
feet
a
quivering
pain
runs
from
the
top
of
my
spine
to
the
sharp
stones
that
seem
to
pass
through
my
pampooties
and
grate
upon
my
ankles
we
stagger
and
groan
beneath
the
weight
but
at
last
our
feet
reach
the
slip
and
we
run
down
with
a
like
the
pace
of
children
a
yard
from
the
sea
we
stop
and
lower
the
curagh
to
the
right
it
must
be
brought
down
gently
a
difficult
task
for
our
strained
and
aching
muscles
and
sometimes
as
the
gunnel
reaches
the
slip
i
lose
my
balance
and
roll
in
among
the
seats
yesterday
we
went
out
in
the
curagh
that
had
been
damaged
on
the
day
of
my
visit
to
kilronan
and
as
we
were
putting
in
the
oars
the
patch
stuck
to
the
slip
which
was
heated
with
the
sunshine
we
carried
up
water
in
the
bailer
the
a
shallow
wooden
vessel
like
a
and
with
infinite
pains
we
got
free
and
rode
away
in
a
few
minutes
however
i
found
the
water
spouting
up
at
my
feet
the
patch
had
been
misplaced
and
this
time
we
had
no
sacking
michael
borrowed
my
pocket
scissors
and
with
admirable
rapidity
cut
a
square
of
flannel
from
the
tail
of
his
shirt
and
squeezed
it
into
the
hole
making
it
fast
with
a
splint
which
he
hacked
from
one
of
the
oars
during
our
excitement
the
tide
had
carried
us
to
the
brink
of
the
rocks
and
i
admired
again
the
dexterity
with
which
he
got
his
oars
into
the
water
and
turned
us
out
as
we
were
mounting
on
a
wave
that
would
have
hurled
us
to
destruction
with
the
injury
to
our
curagh
we
did
not
go
far
from
the
shore
after
a
while
i
took
a
long
spell
at
the
oars
and
gained
a
certain
dexterity
though
they
are
not
easy
to
manage
the
handles
overlap
by
about
six
inches
in
order
to
gain
leverage
as
the
curagh
is
narrow
and
at
first
it
was
almost
impossible
to
avoid
striking
the
upper
oar
against
one
knuckles
the
oars
are
rough
and
square
except
at
the
ends
so
one
can
not
do
so
with
impunity
again
a
curagh
with
two
light
people
in
it
floats
on
the
water
like
a
and
the
slightest
inequality
in
the
stroke
throws
the
prow
round
at
least
a
right
angle
from
its
course
in
the
first
i
found
myself
more
than
once
moving
towards
the
point
i
had
come
from
greatly
to
michael
satisfaction
this
morning
we
were
out
again
near
the
pier
on
the
north
side
of
the
island
as
we
paddled
slowly
with
the
tide
trolling
for
pollock
several
curaghs
weighed
to
the
gunnel
with
kelp
passed
us
on
their
way
to
kilronan
an
old
woman
rolled
in
red
petticoats
was
sitting
on
a
ledge
of
rock
that
runs
into
the
sea
at
the
point
where
the
curaghs
were
passing
from
the
south
hailing
them
in
quavering
gaelic
and
asking
for
a
passage
to
kilronan
the
first
one
that
came
round
without
a
cargo
turned
in
from
some
distance
and
took
her
away
the
morning
had
none
of
the
supernatural
beauty
that
comes
over
the
island
so
often
in
rainy
weather
so
we
basked
in
the
vague
enjoyment
of
the
sunshine
looking
down
at
the
wild
luxuriance
of
the
vegetation
beneath
the
sea
which
contrasts
strangely
with
the
nakedness
above
it
some
dreams
i
have
had
in
this
cottage
seem
to
give
strength
to
the
opinion
that
there
is
a
psychic
memory
attached
to
certain
neighbourhoods
last
night
after
walking
in
a
dream
among
buildings
with
strangely
intense
light
on
them
i
heard
a
faint
rhythm
of
music
beginning
far
away
on
some
stringed
instrument
it
came
closer
to
me
gradually
increasing
in
quickness
and
volume
with
an
irresistibly
definite
progression
when
it
was
quite
near
the
sound
began
to
move
in
my
nerves
and
blood
and
to
urge
me
to
dance
with
them
i
knew
that
if
i
yielded
i
would
be
carried
away
to
some
moment
of
terrible
agony
so
i
struggled
to
remain
quiet
holding
my
knees
together
with
my
hands
the
music
increased
continually
sounding
like
the
strings
of
harps
tuned
to
a
forgotten
scale
and
having
a
resonance
as
searching
as
the
strings
of
the
cello
then
the
luring
excitement
became
more
powerful
than
my
will
and
my
limbs
moved
in
spite
of
me
in
a
moment
i
was
swept
away
in
a
whirlwind
of
notes
my
breath
and
my
thoughts
and
every
impulse
of
my
body
became
a
form
of
the
dance
till
i
could
not
distinguish
between
the
instruments
and
the
rhythm
and
my
own
person
or
consciousness
for
a
while
it
seemed
an
excitement
that
was
filled
with
joy
then
it
grew
into
an
ecstasy
where
all
existence
was
lost
in
a
vortex
of
movement
i
could
not
think
there
had
ever
been
a
life
beyond
the
whirling
of
the
dance
then
with
a
shock
the
ecstasy
turned
to
an
agony
and
rage
i
struggled
to
free
myself
but
seemed
only
to
increase
the
passion
of
the
steps
i
moved
to
when
i
shrieked
i
could
only
echo
the
notes
of
the
rhythm
at
last
with
a
moment
of
uncontrollable
frenzy
i
broke
back
to
consciousness
and
awoke
i
dragged
myself
trembling
to
the
window
of
the
cottage
and
looked
out
the
moon
was
glittering
across
the
bay
and
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
on
the
island
i
am
leaving
in
two
days
and
old
pat
dirane
has
bidden
me
goodbye
he
met
me
in
the
village
this
morning
and
took
me
into
little
tint
a
miserable
hovel
where
he
spends
the
night
i
sat
for
a
long
time
on
his
threshold
while
he
leaned
on
a
stool
behind
me
near
his
bed
and
told
me
the
last
story
i
shall
have
from
him
a
rude
anecdote
not
worth
recording
then
he
told
me
with
careful
emphasis
how
he
had
wandered
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
lived
in
a
fine
college
teaching
irish
to
the
young
priests
they
say
on
the
island
that
he
can
tell
as
many
lies
as
four
men
perhaps
the
stories
he
has
learned
have
strengthened
his
imagination
when
i
stood
up
in
the
doorway
to
give
him
blessing
he
leaned
over
on
the
straw
that
forms
his
bed
and
shed
tears
then
he
turned
to
me
again
lifting
up
one
trembling
hand
with
the
mitten
worn
to
a
hole
on
the
palm
from
the
rubbing
of
his
crutch
not
see
you
again
he
said
with
tears
trickling
on
his
face
you
a
kindly
man
when
you
come
back
next
year
i
wo
be
in
it
i
wo
live
beyond
the
winter
but
listen
now
to
what
telling
you
let
you
put
insurance
on
me
in
the
city
of
dublin
and
it
five
hundred
pounds
you
get
on
my
burial
this
evening
my
last
in
the
island
is
also
the
evening
of
the
a
festival
something
like
of
brittany
i
waited
especially
to
see
it
but
a
piper
who
was
expected
did
not
come
and
there
was
no
amusement
a
few
friends
and
relations
came
over
from
the
other
island
and
stood
about
the
in
their
best
clothes
but
without
music
dancing
was
impossible
i
believe
on
some
occasions
when
the
piper
is
present
there
is
a
fine
day
of
dancing
and
excitement
but
the
galway
piper
is
getting
old
and
is
not
easily
induced
to
undertake
the
voyage
last
night
john
eve
the
fires
were
lighted
and
boys
ran
about
with
pieces
of
the
burning
turf
though
i
could
not
find
out
if
the
idea
of
lighting
the
house
fires
from
the
bonfires
is
still
found
on
the
island
i
have
come
out
of
an
hotel
full
of
tourists
and
commercial
travelers
to
stroll
along
the
edge
of
galway
bay
and
look
out
in
the
direction
of
the
islands
the
sort
of
yearning
i
feel
towards
those
lonely
rocks
is
indescribably
acute
this
town
that
is
usually
so
full
of
wild
human
interest
seems
in
my
present
mood
a
tawdry
medley
of
all
that
is
crudest
in
modern
life
the
nullity
of
the
rich
and
the
squalor
of
the
poor
give
me
the
same
pang
of
wondering
disgust
yet
the
islands
are
fading
already
and
i
can
hardly
realise
that
the
smell
of
the
seaweed
and
the
drone
of
the
atlantic
are
still
moving
round
them
one
of
my
island
friends
has
written
to
me
dear
john
synge

a
long
time

fine
good
pleasant
letter

was
the
baits

good
but
i
lost
two
of
them
and
half

line

big
fish

and
caught

bait
and
the
line

bad
and
half
of
the
line
and
the
baits
went
away
my
sister
has
come
back
from
america
but
i
thinking
it
wo
be

and
let
you
write
in
irish
if
you
do
i
wo
look
on
it
part
ii
the
evening
before
i
returned
to
the
west
i
wrote
to
michael
who
had
left
the
islands
to
earn
his
living
on
the
mainland
to
tell
him
that
i
would
call
at
the
house
where
he
lodged
the
next
morning
which
was
a
sunday
a
young
girl
with
fine
western
features
and
little
english
came
out
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
she
seemed
to
have
heard
all
about
me
and
was
so
filled
with
the
importance
of
her
message
that
she
could
hardly
speak
it
intelligibly
got
your
letter
she
said
confusing
the
pronouns
as
is
often
done
in
the
west
is
gone
to
mass
and
she
be
in
the
square
after
that
let
your
honour
go
now
and
sit
in
the
square
and
michael
will
find
you
as
i
was
returning
up
the
main
street
i
met
michael
wandering
down
to
meet
me
as
he
had
got
tired
of
waiting
he
seemed
to
have
grown
a
powerful
man
since
i
had
seen
him
and
was
now
dressed
in
the
heavy
brown
flannels
of
the
connaught
labourer
after
a
little
talk
we
turned
back
together
and
went
out
on
the
sandhills
above
the
town
meeting
him
here
a
little
beyond
the
threshold
of
my
hotel
i
was
singularly
struck
with
the
refinement
of
his
nature
which
has
hardly
been
influenced
by
his
new
life
and
the
townsmen
and
sailors
he
has
met
with
do
often
come
outside
the
town
on
sunday
he
said
while
we
were
talking
what
is
there
to
do
in
a
town
in
the
middle
of
all
the
people
when
you
are
not
at
your
work
a
little
later
another
labourer
a
friend
of
michael
joined
us
and
we
lay
for
hours
talking
and
arguing
on
the
grass
the
day
was
unbearably
sultry
and
the
sand
and
the
sea
near
us
were
crowded
with
women
but
neither
of
the
young
men
seemed
to
be
aware
of
their
presence
before
we
went
back
to
the
town
a
man
came
out
to
ring
a
young
horse
on
the
sand
close
to
where
we
were
lying
and
then
the
interest
of
my
companions
was
intense
late
in
the
evening
i
met
michael
again
and
we
wandered
round
the
bay
which
was
still
filled
with
bathing
women
until
it
was
quite
dark
i
shall
not
see
him
again
before
my
return
from
the
islands
as
he
is
busy
and
on
tuesday
i
go
out
with
the
steamer
i
returned
to
the
middle
island
this
morning
in
the
steamer
to
kilronan
and
on
here
in
a
curagh
that
had
gone
over
with
salt
fish
as
i
came
up
from
the
slip
the
doorways
in
the
village
filled
with
women
and
children
and
several
came
down
on
the
roadway
to
shake
hands
and
bid
me
a
thousand
welcomes
old
pat
dirane
is
dead
and
several
of
my
friends
have
gone
to
america
that
is
all
the
news
they
have
to
give
me
after
an
absence
of
many
months
when
i
arrived
at
the
cottage
i
was
welcomed
by
the
old
people
and
great
excitement
was
made
by
some
little
presents
i
had
bought
them
a
pair
of
folding
scissors
for
the
old
woman
a
strop
for
her
husband
and
some
other
trifles
then
the
youngest
son
columb
who
is
still
at
home
went
into
the
inner
room
and
brought
out
the
alarm
clock
i
sent
them
last
year
when
i
went
away
am
very
fond
of
this
clock
he
said
patting
it
on
the
back
will
ring
for
me
any
morning
when
i
want
to
go
out
fishing
bedad
there
are
no
two
clocks
in
the
island
that
would
be
equal
to
it
i
had
some
photographs
to
show
them
that
i
took
here
last
year
and
while
i
was
sitting
on
a
little
stool
near
the
door
of
the
kitchen
showing
them
to
the
family
a
beautiful
young
woman
i
had
spoken
to
a
few
times
last
year
slipped
in
and
after
a
wonderfully
simple
and
cordial
speech
of
welcome
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
beside
me
to
look
on
also
the
complete
absence
of
shyness
or
in
most
of
these
people
gives
them
a
peculiar
charm
and
when
this
young
and
beautiful
woman
leaned
across
my
knees
to
look
nearer
at
some
photograph
that
pleased
her
i
felt
more
than
ever
the
strange
simplicity
of
the
island
life
last
year
when
i
came
here
everything
was
new
and
the
people
were
a
little
strange
with
me
but
now
i
am
familiar
with
them
and
their
way
of
life
so
that
their
qualities
strike
me
more
forcibly
than
before
when
my
photographs
of
this
island
had
been
examined
with
immense
delight
and
every
person
in
them
had
been
identified
even
those
who
only
showed
a
hand
or
a
leg
i
brought
out
some
i
had
taken
in
county
wicklow
most
of
them
were
fragments
showing
fairs
in
rathdrum
or
aughrim
men
cutting
turf
on
the
hills
or
other
scenes
of
inland
life
yet
they
gave
the
greatest
delight
to
these
people
who
are
wearied
of
the
sea
this
year
i
see
a
darker
side
of
life
in
the
islands
the
sun
seldom
shines
and
day
after
day
a
cold
wind
blows
over
the
cliffs
bringing
up
showers
of
hail
and
dense
masses
of
cloud
the
sons
who
are
at
home
stay
out
fishing
whenever
it
is
tolerably
calm
from
about
three
in
the
morning
till
after
nightfall
yet
they
earn
little
as
fish
are
not
plentiful
the
old
man
fishes
also
with
a
long
rod
and
but
as
a
rule
has
even
smaller
success
when
the
weather
breaks
completely
fishing
is
abandoned
and
they
both
go
down
and
dig
potatoes
in
the
rain
the
women
sometimes
help
them
but
their
usual
work
is
to
look
after
the
calves
and
do
their
spinning
in
the
house
there
is
a
vague
depression
over
the
family
this
year
because
of
the
two
sons
who
have
gone
away
michael
to
the
mainland
and
another
son
who
was
working
in
kilronan
last
year
to
the
united
states
a
letter
came
yesterday
from
michael
to
his
mother
it
was
written
in
english
as
he
is
the
only
one
of
the
family
who
can
read
or
write
in
irish
and
i
heard
it
being
slowly
spelled
out
and
translated
as
i
sat
in
my
room
a
little
later
the
old
woman
brought
it
in
for
me
to
read
he
told
her
first
about
his
work
and
the
wages
he
is
getting
then
he
said
that
one
night
he
had
been
walking
in
the
town
and
had
looked
up
among
the
streets
and
thought
to
himself
what
a
grand
night
it
would
be
on
the
sandy
head
of
this
island
not
he
added
that
he
was
feeling
lonely
or
sad
at
the
end
he
gave
an
account
with
the
dramatic
emphasis
of
the
of
how
he
had
met
me
on
the
sunday
morning
and
me
he
said
was
the
fine
talk
we
had
for
two
hours
or
three
he
told
them
also
of
a
knife
i
had
given
him
that
was
so
fine
no
one
on
the
island
ever
seen
the
like
of
her
another
day
a
letter
came
from
the
son
who
is
in
america
to
say
that
he
had
had
a
slight
accident
to
one
of
his
arms
but
was
well
again
and
that
he
was
leaving
new
york
and
going
a
few
hundred
miles
up
the
country
all
the
evening
afterwards
the
old
woman
sat
on
her
stool
at
the
corner
of
the
fire
with
her
shawl
over
her
head
keening
piteously
to
herself
america
appeared
far
away
yet
she
seems
to
have
felt
that
after
all
it
was
only
the
other
edge
of
the
atlantic
and
now
when
she
hears
them
talking
of
railroads
and
inland
cities
where
there
is
no
sea
things
she
can
not
understand
it
comes
home
to
her
that
her
son
is
gone
for
ever
she
often
tells
me
how
she
used
to
sit
on
the
wall
behind
the
house
last
year
and
watch
the
hooker
he
worked
in
coming
out
of
kilronan
and
beating
up
the
sound
and
what
company
it
used
to
be
to
her
the
time
they
all
be
out
the
maternal
feeling
is
so
powerful
on
these
islands
that
it
gives
a
life
of
torment
to
the
women
their
sons
grow
up
to
be
banished
as
soon
as
they
are
of
age
or
to
live
here
in
continual
danger
on
the
sea
their
daughters
go
away
also
or
are
worn
out
in
their
youth
with
bearing
children
that
grow
up
to
harass
them
in
their
own
turn
a
little
later
there
has
been
a
storm
for
the
last
hours
and
i
have
been
wandering
on
the
cliffs
till
my
hair
is
stiff
with
salt
immense
masses
of
spray
were
flying
up
from
the
base
of
the
cliff
and
were
caught
at
times
by
the
wind
and
whirled
away
to
fall
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
when
one
of
these
happened
to
fall
on
me
i
had
to
crouch
down
for
an
instant
wrapped
and
blinded
by
a
white
hail
of
foam
the
waves
were
so
enormous
that
when
i
saw
one
more
than
usually
large
coming
towards
me
i
turned
instinctively
to
hide
myself
as
one
blinks
when
struck
upon
the
eyes
after
a
few
hours
the
mind
grows
bewildered
with
the
endless
change
and
struggle
of
the
sea
and
an
utter
despondency
replaces
the
first
moment
of
exhilaration
at
the
corner
of
the
island
i
came
upon
a
number
of
people
gathering
the
seaweed
that
is
now
thick
on
the
rocks
it
was
raked
from
the
surf
by
the
men
and
then
carried
up
to
the
brow
of
the
cliff
by
a
party
of
young
girls
in
addition
to
their
ordinary
clothing
these
girls
wore
a
raw
sheepskin
on
their
shoulders
to
catch
the
oozing
and
they
looked
strangely
wild
and
with
the
salt
caked
upon
their
lips
and
wreaths
of
seaweed
in
their
hair
for
the
rest
of
my
walk
i
saw
no
living
thing
but
one
flock
of
curlews
and
a
few
pipits
hiding
among
the
stones
about
the
sunset
the
clouds
broke
and
the
storm
turned
to
a
hurricane
bars
of
purple
cloud
stretched
across
the
sound
where
immense
waves
were
rolling
from
the
west
wreathed
with
snowy
phantasies
of
spray
then
there
was
the
bay
full
of
green
delirium
and
the
twelve
pins
touched
with
mauve
and
scarlet
in
the
east
the
suggestion
from
this
world
of
inarticulate
power
was
immense
and
now
at
midnight
when
the
wind
is
abating
i
am
still
trembling
and
flushed
with
exultation
i
have
been
walking
through
the
wet
lanes
in
my
pampooties
in
spite
of
the
rain
and
i
have
brought
on
a
feverish
cold
the
wind
is
terrific
if
anything
serious
should
happen
to
me
i
might
die
here
and
be
nailed
in
my
box
and
shoved
down
into
a
wet
crevice
in
the
graveyard
before
any
one
could
know
it
on
the
mainland
two
days
ago
a
curagh
passed
from
the
south
island
they
can
go
out
when
we
are
because
of
a
sheltered
cove
in
their
island
it
was
thought
in
search
of
the
doctor
it
became
too
rough
afterwards
to
make
the
return
journey
and
it
was
only
this
morning
we
saw
them
repassing
towards
the
in
a
terrible
sea
a
curagh
with
two
men
in
her
besides
the
rowers
probably
the
priest
and
the
doctor
went
first
followed
by
the
curagh
from
the
south
island
which
ran
more
danger
often
when
they
go
for
the
doctor
in
weather
like
this
they
bring
the
priest
also
as
they
do
not
know
if
it
will
be
possible
to
go
for
him
if
he
is
needed
later
as
a
rule
there
is
little
illness
and
the
women
often
manage
their
confinements
among
themselves
without
any
trained
assistance
in
most
cases
all
goes
well
but
at
times
a
curagh
is
sent
off
in
desperate
haste
for
the
priest
and
the
doctor
when
it
is
too
late
the
baby
that
spent
some
days
here
last
year
is
now
established
in
the
house
i
suppose
the
old
woman
has
adopted
him
to
console
herself
for
the
loss
of
her
own
sons
he
is
now
a
child
though
not
yet
able
to
say
more
than
a
few
words
of
gaelic
his
favourite
amusement
is
to
stand
behind
the
door
with
a
stick
waiting
for
any
wandering
pig
or
hen
that
may
chance
to
come
in
and
then
to
dash
out
and
pursue
them
there
are
two
young
kittens
in
the
kitchen
also
which
he
without
meaning
to
do
them
harm
whenever
the
old
woman
comes
into
my
room
with
turf
for
the
fire
he
walks
in
solemnly
behind
her
with
a
sod
under
each
arm
deposits
them
on
the
back
of
the
fire
with
great
care
and
then
flies
off
round
the
corner
with
his
long
petticoats
trailing
behind
him
he
has
not
yet
received
any
official
name
on
the
island
as
he
has
not
left
the
fireside
but
in
the
house
they
usually
speak
of
him
as
beug
now
and
then
he
is
slapped
but
for
the
most
part
the
old
woman
keeps
him
in
order
with
stories
of
hag
that
lives
in
the
dun
and
eats
children
who
are
not
good
he
spends
half
his
day
eating
cold
potatoes
and
drinking
very
strong
tea
yet
seems
in
perfect
health
an
irish
letter
has
come
to
me
from
michael
i
will
translate
it
literally
dear
noble
person
i
write
this
letter
with
joy
and
pride
that
you
found
the
way
to
the
house
of
my
father
the
day
you
were
on
the
steamship
i
am
thinking
there
will
not
be
loneliness
on
you
for
there
will
be
the
fine
beautiful
gaelic
league
and
you
will
be
learning
powerfully
i
am
thinking
there
is
no
one
in
life
walking
with
you
now
but
your
own
self
from
morning
till
night
and
great
is
the
pity
what
way
are
my
mother
and
my
three
brothers
and
my
sisters
and
do
not
forget
white
michael
and
the
poor
little
child
and
the
old
grey
woman
and
rory
i
am
getting
a
forgetfulness
on
all
my
friends
and
i
am
your
friend
it
is
curious
how
he
accuses
himself
of
forgetfulness
after
asking
for
all
his
family
by
name
i
suppose
the
first
is
wearing
away
and
he
looks
on
his
independent
wellbeing
as
a
treason
towards
his
kindred
one
of
his
friends
was
in
the
kitchen
when
the
letter
was
brought
to
me
and
by
the
old
man
wish
he
read
it
out
loud
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
it
when
he
came
to
the
last
sentence
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
omitted
it
altogether
this
young
man
had
come
up
to
bring
me
a
copy
of
the
songs
of
connaught
which
he
possesses
and
i
persuaded
him
to
read
or
rather
chant
me
some
of
them
when
he
had
read
a
couple
i
found
that
the
old
woman
knew
many
of
them
from
her
childhood
though
her
version
was
often
not
the
same
as
what
was
in
the
book
she
was
rocking
herself
on
a
stool
in
the
chimney
corner
beside
a
pot
of
indigo
in
which
she
was
dyeing
wool
and
several
times
when
the
young
man
finished
a
poem
she
took
it
up
again
and
recited
the
verses
with
exquisite
musical
intonation
putting
a
wistfulness
and
passion
into
her
voice
that
seemed
to
give
it
all
the
cadences
that
are
sought
in
the
profoundest
poetry
the
lamp
had
burned
low
and
another
terrible
gale
was
howling
and
shrieking
over
the
island
it
seemed
like
a
dream
that
i
should
be
sitting
here
among
these
men
and
women
listening
to
this
rude
and
beautiful
poetry
that
is
filled
with
the
oldest
passions
of
the
world
the
horses
have
been
coming
back
for
the
last
few
days
from
their
summer
grazing
in
connemara
they
are
landed
at
the
sandy
beach
where
the
cattle
were
shipped
last
year
and
i
went
down
early
this
morning
to
watch
their
arrival
through
the
waves
the
hooker
was
anchored
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
but
i
could
see
a
horse
standing
at
the
gunnel
surrounded
by
men
shouting
and
flipping
at
it
with
bits
of
rope
in
a
moment
it
jumped
over
into
the
sea
and
some
men
who
were
waiting
for
it
in
a
curagh
caught
it
by
the
halter
and
towed
it
to
within
twenty
yards
of
the
surf
then
the
curagh
turned
back
to
the
hooker
and
the
horse
was
left
to
make
its
own
way
to
the
land
as
i
was
standing
about
a
man
came
up
to
me
and
asked
after
the
usual
salutations
there
any
war
in
the
world
at
this
time
noble
person
i
told
him
something
of
the
excitement
in
the
transvaal
and
then
another
horse
came
near
the
waves
and
i
passed
on
and
left
him
afterwards
i
walked
round
the
edge
of
the
sea
to
the
pier
where
a
quantity
of
turf
has
recently
been
brought
in
it
is
usually
left
for
some
time
stacked
on
the
sandhills
and
then
carried
up
to
the
cottages
in
panniers
slung
on
donkeys
or
any
horses
that
are
on
the
island
they
have
been
busy
with
it
the
last
few
weeks
and
the
track
from
the
village
to
the
pier
has
been
filled
with
lines
of
boys
driving
their
donkeys
before
them
or
cantering
down
on
their
backs
when
the
panniers
are
empty
in
some
ways
these
men
and
women
seem
strangely
far
away
from
me
they
have
the
same
emotions
that
i
have
and
the
animals
have
yet
i
can
not
talk
to
them
when
there
is
much
to
say
more
than
to
the
dog
that
whines
beside
me
in
a
mountain
fog
there
is
hardly
an
hour
i
am
with
them
that
i
do
not
feel
the
shock
of
some
inconceivable
idea
and
then
again
the
shock
of
some
vague
emotion
that
is
familiar
to
them
and
to
me
on
some
days
i
feel
this
island
as
a
perfect
home
and
resting
place
on
other
days
i
feel
that
i
am
a
waif
among
the
people
i
can
feel
more
with
them
than
they
can
feel
with
me
and
while
i
wander
among
them
they
like
me
sometimes
and
laugh
at
me
sometimes
yet
never
know
what
i
am
doing
in
the
evenings
i
sometimes
meet
with
a
girl
who
is
not
yet
half
through
her
teens
yet
seems
in
some
ways
more
consciously
developed
than
any
one
else
that
i
have
met
here
she
has
passed
part
of
her
life
on
the
mainland
and
the
disillusion
she
found
in
galway
has
coloured
her
imagination
as
we
sit
on
stools
on
either
side
of
the
fire
i
hear
her
voice
going
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
same
sentence
from
the
gaiety
of
a
child
to
the
plaintive
intonation
of
an
old
race
that
is
worn
with
sorrow
at
one
moment
she
is
a
simple
peasant
at
another
she
seems
to
be
looking
out
at
the
world
with
a
sense
of
prehistoric
disillusion
and
to
sum
up
in
the
expression
of
her
eyes
the
whole
external
despondency
of
the
clouds
and
sea
our
conversation
is
usually
disjointed
one
evening
we
talked
of
a
town
on
the
mainland
it
a
queer
place
she
said
would
choose
to
live
in
it
it
a
queer
place
and
indeed
i
do
know
the
place
that
is
another
evening
we
talked
of
the
people
who
live
on
the
island
or
come
to
visit
it
is
gone
she
said
was
a
kind
man
but
a
queer
man
priests
is
queer
people
and
i
do
know
who
is
then
after
a
long
pause
she
told
me
with
seriousness
as
if
speaking
of
a
thing
that
surprised
herself
and
should
surprise
me
that
she
was
very
fond
of
the
boys
in
our
talk
which
is
sometimes
full
of
the
innocent
realism
of
childhood
she
is
always
pathetically
eager
to
say
the
right
thing
and
be
engaging
one
evening
i
found
her
trying
to
light
a
fire
in
the
little
side
room
of
her
cottage
where
there
is
an
ordinary
fireplace
i
went
in
to
help
her
and
showed
her
how
to
hold
up
a
paper
before
the
mouth
of
the
chimney
to
make
a
draught
a
method
she
had
never
seen
then
i
told
her
of
men
who
live
alone
in
paris
and
make
their
own
fires
that
they
may
have
no
one
to
bother
them
she
was
sitting
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
staring
into
the
turf
and
as
i
finished
she
looked
up
with
surprise
like
me
so
she
said
anyone
have
thought
that
below
the
sympathy
we
feel
there
is
still
a
chasm
between
us
she
muttered
as
i
was
leaving
her
this
evening
think
it
to
hell
you
be
going
by
and
by
occasionally
i
meet
her
also
in
the
kitchen
where
young
men
go
to
play
cards
after
dark
and
a
few
girls
slip
in
to
share
the
amusement
at
such
times
her
eyes
shine
in
the
light
of
the
candles
and
her
cheeks
flush
with
the
first
tumult
of
youth
till
she
hardly
seems
the
same
girl
who
sits
every
evening
droning
to
herself
over
the
turf
a
branch
of
the
gaelic
league
has
been
started
here
since
my
last
visit
and
every
sunday
afternoon
three
little
girls
walk
through
the
village
ringing
a
shrill
as
a
signal
that
the
meeting
is
to
be
held
here
it
would
be
useless
to
fix
an
hour
as
the
hours
are
not
recognized
soon
afterwards
bands
of
girls
of
all
ages
from
five
to
begin
to
troop
down
to
the
schoolhouse
in
their
reddest
sunday
petticoats
it
is
remarkable
that
these
young
women
are
willing
to
spend
their
one
afternoon
of
freedom
in
laborious
studies
of
orthography
for
no
reason
but
a
vague
reverence
for
the
gaelic
it
is
true
that
they
owe
this
reverence
or
most
of
it
to
the
influence
of
some
recent
visitors
yet
the
fact
that
they
feel
such
an
influence
so
keenly
is
itself
of
interest
in
the
older
generation
that
did
not
come
under
the
influence
of
the
recent
language
movement
i
do
not
see
any
particular
affection
for
gaelic
whenever
they
are
able
they
speak
english
to
their
children
to
render
them
more
capable
of
making
their
way
in
life
even
the
young
men
sometimes
say
to
me
very
hard
english
on
you
and
i
wish
to
god
i
had
the
like
of
it
the
women
are
the
great
conservative
force
in
this
matter
of
the
language
they
learn
a
little
english
in
school
and
from
their
parents
but
they
rarely
have
occasion
to
speak
with
any
one
who
is
not
a
native
of
the
islands
so
their
knowledge
of
the
foreign
tongue
remains
rudimentary
in
my
cottage
i
have
never
heard
a
word
of
english
from
the
women
except
when
they
were
speaking
to
the
pigs
or
to
the
dogs
or
when
the
girl
was
reading
a
letter
in
english
women
however
with
a
more
assertive
temperament
who
have
had
apparently
the
same
opportunities
often
attain
a
considerable
fluency
as
is
the
case
with
one
a
relative
of
the
old
woman
of
the
house
who
often
visits
here
in
the
boys
school
where
i
sometimes
look
in
the
children
surprise
me
by
their
knowledge
of
english
though
they
always
speak
in
irish
among
themselves
the
school
itself
is
a
comfortless
building
in
a
terribly
bleak
position
in
cold
weather
the
children
arrive
in
the
morning
with
a
sod
of
turf
tied
up
with
their
books
a
simple
toll
which
keeps
the
fire
well
supplied
yet
i
believe
a
more
modern
method
is
soon
to
be
introduced
i
am
in
the
north
island
again
looking
out
with
a
singular
sensation
to
the
cliffs
across
the
sound
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
those
hovels
i
can
just
see
in
the
south
are
filled
with
people
whose
lives
have
the
strange
quality
that
is
found
in
the
oldest
poetry
and
legend
compared
with
them
the
falling
off
that
has
come
with
the
increased
prosperity
of
this
island
is
full
of
discouragement
the
charm
which
the
people
over
there
share
with
the
birds
and
flowers
has
been
replaced
here
by
the
anxiety
of
men
who
are
eager
for
gain
the
eyes
and
expression
are
different
though
the
faces
are
the
same
and
even
the
children
here
seem
to
have
an
indefinable
modern
quality
that
is
absent
from
the
men
of
inishmaan
my
voyage
from
the
middle
island
was
wild
the
morning
was
so
stormy
that
in
ordinary
circumstances
i
would
not
have
attempted
the
passage
but
as
i
had
arranged
to
travel
with
a
curagh
that
was
coming
over
for
the
parish
priest
who
is
to
hold
stations
on
inishmaan
i
did
not
like
to
draw
back
i
went
out
in
the
morning
and
walked
up
the
cliffs
as
usual
several
men
i
fell
in
with
shook
their
heads
when
i
told
them
i
was
going
away
and
said
they
doubted
if
a
curagh
could
cross
the
sound
with
the
sea
that
was
in
it
when
i
went
back
to
the
cottage
i
found
the
curate
had
just
come
across
from
the
south
island
and
had
had
a
worse
passage
than
any
he
had
yet
experienced
the
tide
was
to
turn
at
two
and
after
that
it
was
thought
the
sea
would
be
calmer
as
the
wind
and
the
waves
would
be
running
from
the
same
point
we
sat
about
in
the
kitchen
all
the
morning
with
men
coming
in
every
few
minutes
to
give
their
opinion
whether
the
passage
should
be
attempted
and
at
what
points
the
sea
was
likely
to
be
at
its
worst
at
last
it
was
decided
we
should
go
and
i
started
for
the
pier
in
a
wild
shower
of
rain
with
the
wind
howling
in
the
walls
the
schoolmaster
and
a
priest
who
was
to
have
gone
with
me
came
out
as
i
was
passing
through
the
village
and
advised
me
not
to
make
the
passage
but
my
crew
had
gone
on
towards
the
sea
and
i
thought
it
better
to
go
after
them
the
eldest
son
of
the
family
was
coming
with
me
and
i
considered
that
the
old
man
who
knew
the
waves
better
than
i
did
would
not
send
out
his
son
if
there
was
more
than
reasonable
danger
i
found
my
crew
waiting
for
me
under
a
high
wall
below
the
village
and
we
went
on
together
the
island
had
never
seemed
so
desolate
looking
out
over
the
black
limestone
through
the
driving
rain
to
the
gulf
of
struggling
waves
an
indescribable
feeling
of
dejection
came
over
me
the
old
man
gave
me
his
view
of
the
use
of
fear
man
who
is
not
afraid
of
the
sea
will
soon
be
drowned
he
said
he
will
be
going
out
on
a
day
he
should
but
we
do
be
afraid
of
the
sea
and
we
do
only
be
drownded
now
and
again
a
little
crowd
of
neighbours
had
collected
lower
down
to
see
me
off
and
as
we
crossed
the
sandhills
we
had
to
shout
to
each
other
to
be
heard
above
the
wind
the
crew
carried
down
the
curagh
and
then
stood
under
the
lee
of
the
pier
tying
on
their
hats
with
strings
and
drawing
on
their
oilskins
they
tested
the
braces
of
the
oars
and
the
oarpins
and
everything
in
the
curagh
with
a
care
i
had
not
seen
them
give
to
anything
then
my
bag
was
lifted
in
and
we
were
ready
besides
the
four
men
of
the
crew
a
man
was
going
with
us
who
wanted
a
passage
to
this
island
as
he
was
scrambling
into
the
bow
an
old
man
stood
forward
from
the
crowd
take
that
man
with
you
he
said
week
they
were
taking
him
to
clare
and
the
whole
lot
of
them
were
near
drownded
another
day
he
went
to
inisheer
and
they
broke
three
ribs
of
the
curagh
and
they
coming
back
there
is
not
the
like
of
him
for
in
the
three
islands
divil
choke
your
old
gob
said
the
man
will
be
talking
we
set
off
it
was
a
curagh
and
i
was
given
the
last
seat
so
as
to
leave
the
stern
for
the
man
who
was
steering
with
an
oar
worked
at
right
angles
to
the
others
by
an
extra
in
the
stern
gunnel
when
we
had
gone
about
a
hundred
yards
they
ran
up
a
bit
of
a
sail
in
the
bow
and
the
pace
became
extraordinarily
rapid
the
shower
had
passed
over
and
the
wind
had
fallen
but
large
magnificently
brilliant
waves
were
rolling
down
on
us
at
right
angles
to
our
course
every
instant
the
steersman
whirled
us
round
with
a
sudden
stroke
of
his
oar
the
prow
reared
up
and
then
fell
into
the
next
furrow
with
a
crash
throwing
up
masses
of
spray
as
it
did
so
the
stern
in
its
turn
was
thrown
up
and
both
the
steersman
who
let
go
his
oar
and
clung
with
both
hands
to
the
gunnel
and
myself
were
lifted
high
up
above
the
sea
the
wave
passed
we
regained
our
course
and
rowed
violently
for
a
few
yards
then
the
same
manoeuvre
had
to
be
repeated
as
we
worked
out
into
the
sound
we
began
to
meet
another
class
of
waves
that
could
be
seen
for
some
distance
towering
above
the
rest
when
one
of
these
came
in
sight
the
first
effort
was
to
get
beyond
its
reach
the
steersman
began
crying
out
in
gaelic
siubhal
run
and
sometimes
when
the
mass
was
gliding
towards
us
with
horrible
speed
his
voice
rose
to
a
shriek
then
the
rowers
themselves
took
up
the
cry
and
the
curagh
seemed
to
leap
and
quiver
with
the
frantic
terror
of
a
beast
till
the
wave
passed
behind
it
or
fell
with
a
crash
beside
the
stern
it
was
in
this
racing
with
the
waves
that
our
chief
danger
lay
if
the
wave
could
be
avoided
it
was
better
to
do
so
but
if
it
overtook
us
while
we
were
trying
to
escape
and
caught
us
on
the
broadside
our
destruction
was
certain
i
could
see
the
steersman
quivering
with
the
excitement
of
his
task
for
any
error
in
his
judgment
would
have
swamped
us
we
had
one
narrow
escape
a
wave
appeared
high
above
the
rest
and
there
was
the
usual
moment
of
intense
exertion
it
was
of
no
use
and
in
an
instant
the
wave
seemed
to
be
hurling
itself
upon
us
with
a
yell
of
rage
the
steersman
struggled
with
his
oar
to
bring
our
prow
to
meet
it
he
had
almost
succeeded
when
there
was
a
crash
and
rush
of
water
round
us
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
struck
upon
the
back
with
knotted
ropes
white
foam
gurgled
round
my
knees
and
eyes
the
curagh
reared
up
swaying
and
trembling
for
a
moment
and
then
fell
safely
into
the
furrow
this
was
our
worst
moment
though
more
than
once
when
several
waves
came
so
closely
together
that
we
had
no
time
to
regain
control
of
the
canoe
between
them
we
had
some
dangerous
work
our
lives
depended
upon
the
skill
and
courage
of
the
men
as
the
life
of
the
rider
or
swimmer
is
often
in
his
own
hands
and
the
excitement
was
too
great
to
allow
time
for
fear
i
enjoyed
the
passage
down
in
this
shallow
trough
of
canvas
that
bent
and
trembled
with
the
motion
of
the
men
i
had
a
far
more
intimate
feeling
of
the
glory
and
power
of
the
waves
than
i
have
ever
known
in
a
steamer
old
mourteen
is
keeping
me
company
again
and
i
am
now
able
to
understand
the
greater
part
of
his
irish
he
took
me
out
to
show
me
the
remains
of
some
cloghauns
or
beehive
dwellings
that
are
left
near
the
central
ridge
of
the
island
after
i
had
looked
at
them
we
lay
down
in
the
corner
of
a
little
field
filled
with
the
autumn
sunshine
and
the
odour
of
withering
flowers
while
he
told
me
a
long
which
took
more
than
an
hour
to
narrate
he
is
so
blind
that
i
can
gaze
at
him
without
discourtesy
and
after
a
while
the
expression
of
his
face
made
me
forget
to
listen
and
i
lay
dreamily
in
the
sunshine
letting
the
antique
formulas
of
the
story
blend
with
the
suggestions
from
the
prehistoric
masonry
i
lay
on
the
glow
of
childish
transport
that
came
over
him
when
he
reached
the
nonsense
ending
so
common
in
these
tales
recalled
me
to
myself
and
i
listened
attentively
while
he
gabbled
with
delighted
haste
found
the
path
and
i
found
the
puddle
they
were
drowned
and
i
was
found
if
it
all
one
to
me
tonight
it
was
all
one
to
them
the
next
night
yet
if
it
was
itself
not
a
thing
did
they
lose
but
an
old
back
tooth
or
some
such
gibberish
as
i
led
him
home
through
the
paths
he
described
to
me
it
is
thus
we
get
along
lifting
him
at
times
over
the
low
walls
he
is
too
shaky
to
climb
he
brought
the
conversation
to
the
topic
they
are
never
weary
of
my
views
on
marriage
he
stopped
as
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
island
with
the
stretch
of
the
atlantic
just
visible
behind
him
noble
person
he
began
you
never
be
thinking
on
the
young
girls
the
time
i
was
a
young
man
the
devil
a
one
of
them
could
i
look
on
without
wishing
to
marry
her
mourteen
i
answered
a
great
wonder
you
be
asking
me
what
at
all
do
you
think
of
me
yourself
noble
person
i
thinking
it
soon
you
be
getting
married
listen
to
what
i
telling
you
a
man
who
is
not
married
is
no
better
than
an
old
jackass
he
goes
into
his
sister
house
and
into
his
brother
house
he
eats
a
bit
in
this
place
and
a
bit
in
another
place
but
he
has
no
home
for
himself
like
an
old
jackass
straying
on
the
rocks
i
have
left
aran
the
steamer
had
a
more
than
usually
heavy
cargo
and
it
was
after
four
when
we
sailed
from
kilronan
again
i
saw
the
three
low
rocks
sink
down
into
the
sea
with
a
moment
of
inconceivable
distress
it
was
a
clear
evening
and
as
we
came
out
into
the
bay
the
sun
stood
like
an
aureole
behind
the
cliffs
of
inishmaan
a
little
later
a
brilliant
glow
came
over
the
sky
throwing
out
the
blue
of
the
sea
and
of
the
hills
of
connemara
when
it
was
quite
dark
the
cold
became
intense
and
i
wandered
about
the
lonely
vessel
that
seemed
to
be
making
her
own
way
across
the
sea
i
was
the
only
passenger
and
all
the
crew
except
one
boy
who
was
steering
were
huddled
together
in
the
warmth
of
the
three
hours
passed
and
no
one
stirred
the
slowness
of
the
vessel
and
the
lamentation
of
the
cold
sea
about
her
sides
became
almost
unendurable
then
the
lights
of
galway
came
in
sight
and
the
crew
appeared
as
we
beat
up
slowly
to
the
quay
once
on
shore
i
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
any
one
to
carry
my
baggage
to
the
railway
when
i
found
a
man
in
the
darkness
and
got
my
bag
on
his
shoulders
he
turned
out
to
be
drunk
and
i
had
trouble
to
keep
him
from
rolling
from
the
wharf
with
all
my
possessions
he
professed
to
be
taking
me
by
a
short
cut
into
the
town
but
when
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
waste
of
broken
buildings
and
skeletons
of
ships
he
threw
my
bag
on
the
ground
and
sat
down
on
it
real
heavy
she
is
your
honour
he
said
thinking
gold
there
will
be
in
it
a
is
there
in
it
at
all
but
books
i
answered
him
in
gaelic
is
mor
an
truaghe
a
big
pity
he
said
it
was
gold
was
in
it
it
the
thundering
spree
we
have
together
this
night
in
galway
in
about
half
an
hour
i
got
my
luggage
once
more
on
his
back
and
we
made
our
way
into
the
city
later
in
the
evening
i
went
down
towards
the
quay
to
look
for
michael
as
i
turned
into
the
narrow
street
where
he
lodges
some
one
seemed
to
be
following
me
in
the
shadow
and
when
i
stopped
to
find
the
number
of
his
house
i
heard
the
welcome
of
inishmaan
pronounced
close
to
me
it
was
michael
saw
you
in
the
street
he
said
i
was
ashamed
to
speak
to
you
in
the
middle
of
the
people
so
i
followed
you
the
way
i
see
if
you
remember
me
we
turned
back
together
and
walked
about
the
town
till
he
had
to
go
to
his
lodgings
he
was
still
just
the
same
with
all
his
old
simplicity
and
shrewdness
but
the
work
he
has
here
does
not
agree
with
him
and
he
is
not
contented
it
was
the
eve
of
the
parnell
celebration
in
dublin
and
the
town
was
full
of
excursionists
waiting
for
a
train
which
was
to
start
at
midnight
when
michael
left
me
i
spent
some
time
in
an
hotel
and
then
wandered
down
to
the
railway
a
wild
crowd
was
on
the
platform
surging
round
the
train
in
every
stage
of
intoxication
it
gave
me
a
better
instance
than
i
had
yet
seen
of
the
temperament
of
connaught
the
tension
of
human
excitement
seemed
greater
in
this
insignificant
crowd
than
anything
i
have
felt
among
enormous
mobs
in
rome
or
paris
there
were
a
few
people
from
the
islands
on
the
platform
and
i
got
in
along
with
them
to
a
carriage
one
of
the
women
of
the
party
had
her
niece
with
her
a
young
girl
from
connaught
who
was
put
beside
me
at
the
other
end
of
the
carriage
there
were
some
old
men
who
were
talking
irish
and
a
young
man
who
had
been
a
sailor
when
the
train
started
there
were
wild
cheers
and
cries
on
the
platform
and
in
the
train
itself
the
noise
was
intense
men
and
women
shrieking
and
singing
and
beating
their
sticks
on
the
partitions
at
several
stations
there
was
a
rush
to
the
bar
so
the
excitement
increased
as
we
proceeded
at
ballinasloe
there
were
some
soldiers
on
the
platform
looking
for
places
the
sailor
in
our
compartment
had
a
dispute
with
one
of
them
and
in
an
instant
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
compartment
was
filled
with
reeling
uniforms
and
sticks
peace
was
made
after
a
moment
of
uproar
and
the
soldiers
got
out
but
as
they
did
so
a
pack
of
their
women
followers
thrust
their
bare
heads
and
arms
into
the
doorway
cursing
and
blaspheming
with
extraordinary
rage
as
the
train
moved
away
a
moment
later
these
women
set
up
a
frantic
lamentation
i
looked
out
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
wildest
heads
and
figures
i
have
ever
seen
shrieking
and
screaming
and
waving
their
naked
arms
in
the
light
of
the
lanterns
as
the
night
went
on
girls
began
crying
out
in
the
carriage
next
us
and
i
could
hear
the
words
of
obscene
songs
when
the
train
stopped
at
a
station
in
our
own
compartment
the
sailor
would
allow
no
one
to
sleep
and
talked
all
night
with
sometimes
a
touch
of
wit
or
brutality
and
always
with
a
beautiful
fluency
with
wild
temperament
behind
it
the
old
men
in
the
corner
dressed
in
black
coats
that
had
something
of
the
antiquity
of
heirlooms
talked
all
night
among
themselves
in
gaelic
the
young
girl
beside
me
lost
her
shyness
after
a
while
and
let
me
point
out
the
features
of
the
country
that
were
beginning
to
appear
through
the
dawn
as
we
drew
nearer
dublin
she
was
delighted
with
the
shadows
of
the
trees
trees
are
rare
in
connaught
and
with
the
canal
which
was
beginning
to
reflect
the
morning
light
every
time
i
showed
her
some
new
shadow
she
cried
out
with
naive
excitement
it
lovely
but
i
ca
see
it
this
presence
at
my
side
contrasted
curiously
with
the
brutality
that
shook
the
barrier
behind
us
the
whole
spirit
of
the
west
of
ireland
with
its
strange
wildness
and
reserve
seemed
moving
in
this
single
train
to
pay
a
last
homage
to
the
dead
statesman
of
the
east
part
iii
a
letter
has
come
from
michael

at

in
the
beginning
of

a
fortnight

was
very
bad
with
the
influence
but
i
took
good
care
of
myself
i
am
getting
good
wages
from
the
first
of
this
year
and
i

although
it
is
not
hard
i

working
in
a
and
getting
the

for
the
wood

keeping
an
account
of
it
i
am
getting

or
three
times
a
week

dear
friend
another
letter
in
a
more
rhetorical
mood
my
dear
i
am
for
a
long
time
trying
to
spare
a
little
time
for
to
write
a
few
words
to
you
hoping
that
you
are
still
considering
good
and
pleasant
health
since
i
got
a
letter
from
you
before
i
see
now
that
your
time
is
coming
round
to
come
to
this
place
to
learn
your
native
language
there
was
a
great
feis
in
this
island
two
weeks
ago
and
there
was
a
very
large
attendance
from
the
south
island
and
not
very
many
from
the
north
two
cousins
of
my
own
have
been
in
this
house
for
three
weeks
or
beyond
it
but
now
they
are
gone
and
there
is
a
place
for
you
if
you
wish
to
come
and
you
can
write
before
you
and
we
try
and
manage
you
as
well
as
we
can
i
am
at
home
now
for
about
two
months
for
the
mill
was
burnt
where
i
was
at
work
after
that
i
was
in
dublin
but
i
did
not
get
my
health
in
that
mise
le
mor
mheas
ort
a
chara
soon
after
i
received
this
letter
i
wrote
to
michael
to
say
that
i
was
going
back
to
them
this
time
i
chose
a
day
when
the
steamer
went
direct
to
the
middle
island
and
as
we
came
up
between
the
two
lines
of
curaghs
that
were
waiting
outside
the
slip
i
saw
michael
dressed
once
more
in
his
island
clothes
rowing
in
one
of
them
he
made
no
sign
of
recognition
but
as
soon
as
they
could
get
alongside
he
clambered
on
board
and
came
straight
up
on
the
bridge
to
where
i
was
tu
go
maith
you
well
he
said
is
your
bag
his
curagh
had
got
a
bad
place
near
the
bow
of
the
steamer
so
i
was
slung
down
from
a
considerable
height
on
top
of
some
sacks
of
flour
and
my
own
bag
while
the
curagh
swayed
and
battered
itself
against
the
side
when
we
were
clear
i
asked
michael
if
he
had
got
my
letter
no
he
said
a
sight
of
it
but
maybe
it
will
come
next
week
part
of
the
slip
had
been
washed
away
during
the
winter
so
we
had
to
land
to
the
left
of
it
among
the
rocks
taking
our
turn
with
the
other
curaghs
that
were
coming
in
as
soon
as
i
was
on
shore
the
men
crowded
round
me
to
bid
me
welcome
asking
me
as
they
shook
hands
if
i
had
travelled
far
in
the
winter
and
seen
many
wonders
ending
as
usual
with
the
inquiry
if
there
was
much
war
at
present
in
the
world
it
gave
me
a
thrill
of
delight
to
hear
their
gaelic
blessings
and
to
see
the
steamer
moving
away
leaving
me
quite
alone
among
them
the
day
was
fine
with
a
clear
sky
and
the
sea
was
glittering
beyond
the
limestone
further
off
a
light
haze
on
the
cliffs
of
the
larger
island
and
on
the
connaught
hills
gave
me
the
illusion
that
it
was
still
summer
a
little
boy
was
sent
off
to
tell
the
old
woman
that
i
was
coming
and
we
followed
slowly
talking
and
carrying
the
baggage
when
i
had
exhausted
my
news
they
told
me
theirs
a
power
of
strangers
four
or
five
a
french
priest
among
them
had
been
on
the
island
in
the
summer
the
potatoes
were
bad
but
the
rye
had
begun
well
till
a
dry
week
came
and
then
it
had
turned
into
oats
you
did
know
us
so
well
said
the
man
who
was
talking
think
it
was
a
lie
we
were
telling
but
the
sorrow
a
lie
is
in
it
it
grew
straight
and
well
till
it
was
high
as
your
knee
then
it
turned
into
oats
did
ever
you
see
the
like
of
that
in
county
wicklow
in
the
cottage
everything
was
as
usual
but
michael
presence
has
brought
back
the
old
woman
humour
and
contentment
as
i
sat
down
on
my
stool
and
lit
my
pipe
with
the
corner
of
a
sod
i
could
have
cried
out
with
the
feeling
of
festivity
that
this
return
procured
me
this
year
michael
is
busy
in
the
daytime
but
at
present
there
is
a
harvest
moon
and
we
spend
most
of
the
evening
wandering
about
the
island
looking
out
over
the
bay
where
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
throw
strange
patterns
of
gold
and
black
as
we
were
returning
through
the
village
this
evening
a
tumult
of
revelry
broke
out
from
one
of
the
smaller
cottages
and
michael
said
it
was
the
young
boys
and
girls
who
have
sport
at
this
time
of
the
year
i
would
have
liked
to
join
them
but
feared
to
embarrass
their
amusement
when
we
passed
on
again
the
groups
of
scattered
cottages
on
each
side
of
the
way
reminded
me
of
places
i
have
sometimes
passed
when
travelling
at
night
in
france
or
bavaria
places
that
seemed
so
enshrined
in
the
blue
silence
of
night
one
could
not
believe
they
would
reawaken
afterwards
we
went
up
on
the
dun
where
michael
said
he
had
never
been
before
after
nightfall
though
he
lives
within
a
the
place
gains
unexpected
grandeur
in
this
light
standing
out
like
a
corona
of
prehistoric
stone
upon
the
summit
of
the
island
we
walked
round
the
top
of
the
wall
for
some
time
looking
down
on
the
faint
yellow
roofs
with
the
rocks
glittering
beyond
them
and
the
silence
of
the
bay
though
michael
is
sensible
of
the
beauty
of
the
nature
round
him
he
never
speaks
of
it
directly
and
many
of
our
evening
walks
are
occupied
with
long
gaelic
discourses
about
the
movements
of
the
stars
and
moon
these
people
make
no
distinction
between
the
natural
and
the
supernatural
this
afternoon
it
was
sunday
when
there
is
usually
some
interesting
talk
among
the
islanders
it
rained
so
i
went
into
the
schoolmaster
kitchen
which
is
a
good
deal
frequented
by
the
more
advanced
among
the
people
i
know
so
little
of
their
ways
of
fishing
and
farming
that
i
do
not
find
it
easy
to
keep
up
our
talk
without
reaching
matters
where
they
can
not
follow
me
and
since
the
novelty
of
my
photographs
has
passed
off
i
have
some
difficulty
in
giving
them
the
entertainment
they
seem
to
expect
from
my
company
i
showed
them
some
simple
gymnastic
feats
and
conjurer
tricks
which
gave
them
great
amusement
us
now
said
an
old
woman
when
i
had
finished
you
learn
those
things
from
the
witches
that
do
be
out
in
the
country
in
one
of
the
tricks
i
seemed
to
join
a
piece
of
string
which
was
cut
by
the
people
and
the
illusion
was
so
complete
that
i
saw
one
man
going
off
with
it
into
a
corner
and
pulling
at
the
apparent
joining
till
he
sank
red
furrows
round
his
hands
then
he
brought
it
back
to
me
he
said
is
the
greatest
wonder
ever
i
seen
the
cord
is
a
taste
thinner
where
you
joined
it
but
as
strong
as
ever
it
was
a
few
of
the
younger
men
looked
doubtful
but
the
older
people
who
have
watched
the
rye
turning
into
oats
seemed
to
accept
the
magic
frankly
and
did
not
show
any
surprise
that
duine
uasal
a
noble
person
should
be
able
to
do
like
the
witches
my
intercourse
with
these
people
has
made
me
realise
that
miracles
must
abound
wherever
the
new
conception
of
law
is
not
understood
on
these
islands
alone
miracles
enough
happen
every
year
to
equip
a
divine
emissary
rye
is
turned
into
oats
storms
are
raised
to
keep
evictors
from
the
shore
cows
that
are
isolated
on
lonely
rocks
bring
forth
calves
and
other
things
of
the
same
kind
are
common
the
wonder
is
a
rare
expected
event
like
the
thunderstorm
or
the
rainbow
except
that
it
is
a
little
rarer
and
a
little
more
wonderful
often
when
i
am
walking
and
get
into
conversation
with
some
of
the
people
and
tell
them
that
i
have
received
a
paper
from
dublin
they
ask
me
is
there
any
great
wonder
in
the
world
at
this
time
when
i
had
finished
my
feats
of
dexterity
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
none
of
the
islanders
even
the
youngest
and
most
agile
could
do
what
i
did
as
i
pulled
their
limbs
about
in
my
effort
to
teach
them
i
felt
that
the
ease
and
beauty
of
their
movements
has
made
me
think
them
lighter
than
they
really
are
seen
in
their
curaghs
between
these
cliffs
and
the
atlantic
they
appear
lithe
and
small
but
if
they
were
dressed
as
we
are
and
seen
in
an
ordinary
room
many
of
them
would
seem
heavily
and
powerfully
made
one
man
however
the
champion
dancer
of
the
island
got
up
after
a
while
and
displayed
the
salmon
leap
lying
flat
on
his
face
and
then
springing
up
horizontally
high
in
the
air
and
some
other
feats
of
extraordinary
agility
but
he
is
not
young
and
we
could
not
get
him
to
dance
in
the
evening
i
had
to
repeat
my
tricks
here
in
the
kitchen
for
the
fame
of
them
had
spread
over
the
island
no
doubt
these
feats
will
be
remembered
here
for
generations
the
people
have
so
few
images
for
description
that
they
seize
on
anything
that
is
remarkable
in
their
visitors
and
use
it
afterwards
in
their
talk
for
the
last
few
years
when
they
are
speaking
of
any
one
with
fine
rings
they
say
had
beautiful
rings
on
her
fingers
like
lady
a
visitor
to
the
island
i
have
been
down
sitting
on
the
pier
till
it
was
quite
dark
i
am
only
beginning
to
understand
the
nights
of
inishmaan
and
the
influence
they
have
had
in
giving
distinction
to
these
men
who
do
most
of
their
work
after
nightfall
i
could
hear
nothing
but
a
few
curlews
and
other
whistling
and
shrieking
in
the
seaweed
and
the
low
rustling
of
the
waves
it
was
one
of
the
dark
sultry
nights
peculiar
to
september
with
no
light
anywhere
except
the
phosphorescence
of
the
sea
and
an
occasional
rift
in
the
clouds
that
showed
the
stars
behind
them
the
sense
of
solitude
was
immense
i
could
not
see
or
realise
my
own
body
and
i
seemed
to
exist
merely
in
my
perception
of
the
waves
and
of
the
crying
birds
and
of
the
smell
of
seaweed
when
i
tried
to
come
home
i
lost
myself
among
the
sandhills
and
the
night
seemed
to
grow
unutterably
cold
and
dejected
as
i
groped
among
slimy
masses
of
seaweed
and
wet
crumbling
walls
after
a
while
i
heard
a
movement
in
the
sand
and
two
grey
shadows
appeared
beside
me
they
were
two
men
who
were
going
home
from
fishing
i
spoke
to
them
and
knew
their
voices
and
we
went
home
together
in
the
autumn
season
the
threshing
of
the
rye
is
one
of
the
many
tasks
that
fall
to
the
men
and
boys
the
sheaves
are
collected
on
a
bare
rock
and
then
each
is
beaten
separately
on
a
couple
of
stones
placed
on
end
one
against
the
other
the
land
is
so
poor
that
a
field
hardly
produces
more
grain
than
is
needed
for
seed
the
following
year
so
the
is
carried
on
merely
for
the
straw
which
is
used
for
thatching
the
stooks
are
carried
to
and
from
the
threshing
fields
piled
on
donkeys
that
one
meets
everywhere
at
this
season
with
their
black
unbridled
heads
just
visible
beneath
a
pinnacle
of
golden
straw
while
the
threshing
is
going
on
sons
and
daughters
keep
turning
up
with
one
thing
and
another
till
there
is
a
little
crowd
on
the
rocks
and
any
one
who
is
passing
stops
for
an
hour
or
two
to
talk
on
his
way
to
the
sea
so
that
like
the
in
the
this
work
is
full
of
sociability
when
the
threshing
is
over
the
straw
is
taken
up
to
the
cottages
and
piled
up
in
an
outhouse
or
more
often
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
where
it
brings
a
new
liveliness
of
colour
a
few
days
ago
when
i
was
visiting
a
cottage
where
there
are
the
most
beautiful
children
on
the
island
the
eldest
daughter
a
girl
of
about
fourteen
went
and
sat
down
on
a
heap
of
straw
by
the
doorway
a
ray
of
sunlight
fell
on
her
and
on
a
portion
of
the
rye
giving
her
figure
and
red
dress
with
the
straw
under
it
a
curious
relief
against
the
nets
and
oilskins
and
forming
a
natural
picture
of
exquisite
harmony
and
colour
in
our
own
cottage
the
thatching
it
is
done
every
year
has
just
been
carried
out
the
was
done
partly
in
the
lane
partly
in
the
kitchen
when
the
weather
was
uncertain
two
men
usually
sit
together
at
this
work
one
of
them
hammering
the
straw
with
a
heavy
block
of
wood
the
other
forming
the
rope
the
main
body
of
which
is
twisted
by
a
boy
or
girl
with
a
bent
stick
specially
formed
for
this
employment
in
wet
weather
when
the
work
must
be
done
indoors
the
person
who
is
twisting
recedes
gradually
out
of
the
door
across
the
lane
and
sometimes
across
a
field
or
two
beyond
it
a
great
length
is
needed
to
form
the
close
network
which
is
spread
over
the
thatch
as
each
piece
measures
about
fifty
yards
when
this
work
is
in
progress
in
half
the
cottages
of
the
village
the
road
has
a
curious
look
and
one
has
to
pick
one
steps
through
a
maze
of
twisting
ropes
that
pass
from
the
dark
doorways
on
either
side
into
the
fields
when
four
or
five
immense
balls
of
rope
have
been
completed
a
thatching
party
is
arranged
and
before
dawn
some
morning
they
come
down
to
the
house
and
the
work
is
taken
in
hand
with
such
energy
that
it
is
usually
ended
within
the
day
like
all
work
that
is
done
in
common
on
the
island
the
thatching
is
regarded
as
a
sort
of
festival
from
the
moment
a
roof
is
taken
in
hand
there
is
a
whirl
of
laughter
and
talk
till
it
is
ended
and
as
the
man
whose
house
is
being
covered
is
a
host
instead
of
an
employer
he
lays
himself
out
to
please
the
men
who
work
with
him
the
day
our
own
house
was
thatched
the
large
table
was
taken
into
the
kitchen
from
my
room
and
high
teas
were
given
every
few
hours
most
of
the
people
who
came
along
the
road
turned
down
into
the
kitchen
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
talking
was
incessant
once
when
i
went
into
the
window
i
heard
michael
retailing
my
astronomical
lectures
from
the
apex
of
the
gable
but
usually
their
topics
have
to
do
with
the
affairs
of
the
island
it
is
likely
that
much
of
the
intelligence
and
charm
of
these
people
is
due
to
the
absence
of
any
division
of
labour
and
to
the
correspondingly
wide
development
of
each
individual
whose
varied
knowledge
and
skill
necessitates
a
considerable
activity
of
mind
each
man
can
speak
two
languages
he
is
a
skilled
fisherman
and
can
manage
a
curagh
with
extraordinary
nerve
and
dexterity
he
can
farm
simply
burn
kelp
cut
out
pampooties
mend
nets
build
and
thatch
a
house
and
make
a
cradle
or
a
coffin
his
work
changes
with
the
seasons
in
a
way
that
keeps
him
free
from
the
dullness
that
comes
to
people
who
have
always
the
same
occupation
the
danger
of
his
life
on
the
sea
gives
him
the
alertness
of
the
primitive
hunter
and
the
long
nights
he
spends
fishing
in
his
curagh
bring
him
some
of
the
emotions
that
are
thought
peculiar
to
men
who
have
lived
with
the
arts
as
michael
is
busy
in
the
daytime
i
have
got
a
boy
to
come
up
and
read
irish
to
me
every
afternoon
he
is
about
fifteen
and
is
singularly
intelligent
with
a
real
sympathy
for
the
language
and
the
stories
we
read
one
evening
when
he
had
been
reading
to
me
for
two
hours
i
asked
him
if
he
was
tired
he
said
you
would
ever
be
tired
reading
a
few
years
ago
this
predisposition
for
intellectual
things
would
have
made
him
sit
with
old
people
and
learn
their
stories
but
now
boys
like
him
turn
to
books
and
to
papers
in
irish
that
are
sent
them
from
dublin
in
most
of
the
stories
we
read
where
the
english
and
irish
are
printed
side
by
side
i
see
him
looking
across
to
the
english
in
passages
that
are
a
little
obscure
though
he
is
indignant
if
i
say
that
he
knows
english
better
than
irish
probably
he
knows
the
local
irish
better
than
english
and
printed
english
better
than
printed
irish
as
the
latter
has
frequent
dialectic
forms
he
does
not
know
a
few
days
ago
when
he
was
reading
a
from
douglas
beside
the
fire
something
caught
his
eye
in
the
translation
a
mistake
in
the
english
he
said
after
a
hesitation
put
gold
chair
instead
of
golden
chair
i
pointed
out
that
we
speak
of
gold
watches
and
gold
pins
why
would
we
he
said
golden
chair
would
be
much
nicer
it
is
curious
to
see
how
his
rudimentary
culture
has
given
him
the
beginning
of
a
critical
spirit
that
occupies
itself
with
the
form
of
language
as
well
as
with
ideas
one
day
i
alluded
to
my
trick
of
joining
string
ca
join
a
string
do
be
saying
it
he
said
know
what
way
you
after
fooling
us
but
you
did
join
that
string
not
a
bit
of
you
another
day
when
he
was
with
me
the
fire
burned
low
and
i
held
up
a
newspaper
before
it
to
make
a
draught
it
did
not
answer
very
well
and
though
the
boy
said
nothing
i
saw
he
thought
me
a
fool
the
next
day
he
ran
up
in
great
excitement
after
trying
the
paper
over
the
fire
he
said
it
burned
grand
did
i
think
when
i
seen
you
doing
it
there
was
no
good
in
it
at
all
but
i
put
a
paper
over
the
master
the
fire
and
it
flamed
up
then
i
pulled
back
the
corner
of
the
paper
and
i
ran
my
head
in
and
believe
me
there
was
a
big
cold
wind
blowing
up
the
chimney
that
would
sweep
the
head
from
you
we
nearly
quarrelled
because
he
wanted
me
to
take
his
photograph
in
his
sunday
clothes
from
galway
instead
of
his
native
homespuns
that
become
him
far
better
though
he
does
not
like
them
as
they
seem
to
connect
him
with
the
primitive
life
of
the
island
with
his
keen
temperament
he
may
go
far
if
he
can
ever
step
out
into
the
world
he
is
constantly
thinking
one
day
he
asked
me
if
there
was
great
wonder
on
their
names
out
in
the
country
i
said
there
was
no
wonder
on
them
at
all
he
said
is
great
wonder
on
your
name
in
the
island
and
i
was
thinking
maybe
there
would
be
great
wonder
on
our
names
out
in
the
country
in
a
sense
he
is
right
though
the
names
here
are
ordinary
enough
they
are
used
in
a
way
that
differs
altogether
from
the
modern
system
of
surnames
when
a
child
begins
to
wander
about
the
island
the
neighbours
speak
of
it
by
its
christian
name
followed
by
the
christian
name
of
its
father
if
this
is
not
enough
to
identify
it
the
epithet
whether
it
is
a
nickname
or
the
name
of
his
own
father
is
added
sometimes
when
the
father
name
does
not
lend
itself
the
christian
name
is
adopted
as
epithet
for
the
children
an
old
woman
near
this
cottage
is
called
and
her
sons
are
pheggeen
pheggeen
etc
occasionally
the
surname
is
employed
in
its
irish
form
but
i
have
not
heard
them
using
the
prefix
when
speaking
irish
among
themselves
perhaps
the
idea
of
a
surname
which
it
gives
is
too
modern
for
them
perhaps
they
do
use
it
at
times
that
i
have
not
noticed
sometimes
a
man
is
named
from
the
colour
of
his
hair
there
is
thus
a
seaghan
ruadh
red
john
and
his
children
are
seaghan
ruadh
etc
another
man
is
known
as
iasgaire
fisher
and
his
children
are
an
iasgaire
daughter
of
the
fisher
and
so
on
the
schoolmaster
tells
me
that
when
he
reads
out
the
roll
in
the
morning
the
children
repeat
the
local
name
all
together
in
a
whisper
after
each
official
name
and
then
the
child
answers
if
he
calls
for
instance
the
children
murmur
seaghan
dearg
or
some
such
name
and
the
boy
answers
people
who
come
to
the
island
are
treated
in
much
the
same
way
a
french
gaelic
student
was
in
the
islands
recently
and
he
is
always
spoken
of
as
saggart
ruadh
red
priest
or
as
saggart
francach
french
priest
but
never
by
his
name
if
an
islander
name
alone
is
enough
to
distinguish
him
it
is
used
by
itself
and
i
know
one
man
who
is
spoken
of
as
eamonn
there
may
be
other
edmunds
on
the
island
but
if
so
they
have
probably
good
nicknames
or
epithets
of
their
own
in
other
countries
where
the
names
are
in
a
somewhat
similar
condition
as
in
modern
greece
the
man
calling
is
usually
one
of
the
most
common
means
of
distinguishing
him
but
in
this
place
where
all
have
the
same
calling
this
means
is
not
available
late
this
evening
i
saw
a
curagh
with
two
old
women
in
her
besides
the
rowers
landing
at
the
slip
through
a
heavy
roll
they
were
coming
from
inishere
and
they
rowed
up
quickly
enough
till
they
were
within
a
few
yards
of
the
where
they
spun
round
and
waited
with
the
prow
towards
the
sea
while
wave
after
wave
passed
underneath
them
and
broke
on
the
remains
of
the
slip
five
minutes
passed
ten
minutes
and
still
they
waited
with
the
oars
just
paddling
in
the
water
and
their
heads
turned
over
their
shoulders
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
they
would
have
to
give
up
and
row
round
to
the
lee
side
of
the
island
when
the
curagh
seemed
suddenly
to
turn
into
a
living
thing
the
prow
was
again
towards
the
slip
leaping
and
hurling
itself
through
the
spray
before
it
touched
the
man
in
the
bow
wheeled
round
two
white
legs
came
out
over
the
prow
like
the
flash
of
a
sword
and
before
the
next
wave
arrived
he
had
dragged
the
curagh
out
of
danger
this
sudden
and
united
action
in
men
without
discipline
shows
well
the
education
that
the
waves
have
given
them
when
the
curagh
was
in
safety
the
two
old
women
were
carried
up
through
the
surf
and
slippery
seaweed
on
the
backs
of
their
sons
in
this
broken
weather
a
curagh
can
not
go
out
without
danger
yet
accidents
are
rare
and
seem
to
be
nearly
always
caused
by
drink
since
i
was
here
last
year
four
men
have
been
drowned
on
their
way
home
from
the
large
island
first
a
curagh
belonging
to
the
south
island
which
put
off
with
two
men
in
her
heavy
with
drink
came
to
shore
here
the
next
evening
dry
and
uninjured
with
the
sail
half
set
and
no
one
in
her
more
recently
a
curagh
from
this
island
with
three
men
who
were
the
worse
for
drink
was
upset
on
its
way
home
the
steamer
was
not
far
off
and
saved
two
of
the
men
but
could
not
reach
the
third
now
a
man
has
been
washed
ashore
in
donegal
with
one
pampooty
on
him
and
a
striped
shirt
with
a
purse
in
one
of
the
pockets
and
a
box
for
tobacco
for
three
days
the
people
have
been
trying
to
fix
his
identity
some
think
it
is
the
man
from
this
island
others
think
that
the
man
from
the
south
answers
the
description
more
exactly
as
we
were
returning
from
the
slip
we
met
the
mother
of
the
man
who
was
drowned
from
this
island
still
weeping
and
looking
out
over
the
sea
she
stopped
the
people
who
had
come
over
from
the
south
island
to
ask
them
with
a
terrified
whisper
what
is
thought
over
there
later
in
the
evening
when
i
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
cottages
the
sister
of
the
dead
man
came
in
through
the
rain
with
her
infant
and
there
was
a
long
talk
about
the
rumours
that
had
come
in
she
pieced
together
all
she
could
remember
about
his
clothes
and
what
his
purse
was
like
and
where
he
had
got
it
and
the
same
for
his
tobacco
box
and
his
stockings
in
the
end
there
seemed
little
doubt
that
it
was
her
brother
she
said
mike
sure
enough
and
please
god
they
give
him
a
decent
burial
then
she
began
to
keen
slowly
to
herself
she
had
loose
yellow
hair
plastered
round
her
head
with
the
rain
and
as
she
sat
by
the
door
sucking
her
infant
she
seemed
like
a
type
of
the
women
life
upon
the
islands
for
a
while
the
people
sat
silent
and
one
could
hear
nothing
but
the
lips
of
the
infant
the
rain
hissing
in
the
yard
and
the
breathing
of
four
pigs
that
lay
sleeping
in
one
corner
then
one
of
the
men
began
to
talk
about
the
new
boats
that
have
been
sent
to
the
south
island
and
the
conversation
went
back
to
its
usual
round
of
topics
the
loss
of
one
man
seems
a
slight
catastrophe
to
all
except
the
immediate
relatives
often
when
an
accident
happens
a
father
is
lost
with
his
two
eldest
sons
or
in
some
other
way
all
the
active
men
of
a
household
die
together
a
few
years
ago
three
men
of
a
family
that
used
to
make
the
wooden
vessels
like
tiny
barrels
that
are
still
used
among
the
people
went
to
the
big
island
together
they
were
drowned
on
their
way
home
and
the
art
of
making
these
little
barrels
died
with
them
at
least
on
inishmaan
though
it
still
lingers
in
the
north
and
south
islands
another
catastrophe
that
took
place
last
winter
gave
a
curious
zest
to
the
observance
of
holy
days
it
seems
that
it
is
not
the
custom
for
the
men
to
go
out
fishing
on
the
evening
of
a
holy
day
but
one
night
last
december
some
men
who
wished
to
begin
fishing
early
the
next
morning
rowed
out
to
sleep
in
their
hookers
towards
morning
a
terrible
storm
rose
and
several
hookers
with
their
crews
on
board
were
blown
from
their
moorings
and
wrecked
the
sea
was
so
high
that
no
attempt
at
rescue
could
be
made
and
the
men
were
drowned
said
the
man
who
told
me
the
story
thinking
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
men
will
go
out
again
on
a
holy
day
that
storm
was
the
only
storm
that
reached
into
the
harbour
the
whole
winter
and
i
thinking
there
was
something
in
it
today
when
i
went
down
to
the
slip
i
found
a
from
kilronan
with
about
twenty
pigs
that
were
to
be
shipped
for
the
english
market
when
the
steamer
was
getting
near
the
whole
drove
was
moved
down
on
the
slip
and
the
curaghs
were
carried
out
close
to
the
sea
then
each
beast
was
caught
in
its
turn
and
thrown
on
its
side
while
its
legs
were
hitched
together
in
a
single
knot
with
a
tag
of
rope
remaining
by
which
it
could
be
carried
probably
the
pain
inflicted
was
not
great
yet
the
animals
shut
their
eyes
and
shrieked
with
almost
human
intonations
till
the
suggestion
of
the
noise
became
so
intense
that
the
men
and
women
who
were
merely
looking
on
grew
wild
with
excitement
and
the
pigs
waiting
their
turn
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
tore
each
other
with
their
teeth
after
a
while
there
was
a
pause
the
whole
slip
was
covered
with
a
mass
of
sobbing
animals
with
here
and
there
a
terrified
woman
crouching
among
the
bodies
and
patting
some
special
favourite
to
keep
it
quiet
while
the
curaghs
were
being
launched
then
the
screaming
began
again
while
the
pigs
were
carried
out
and
laid
in
their
places
with
a
waistcoat
tied
round
their
feet
to
keep
them
from
damaging
the
canvas
they
seemed
to
know
where
they
were
going
and
looked
up
at
me
over
the
gunnel
with
an
ignoble
desperation
that
made
me
shudder
to
think
that
i
had
eaten
of
this
whimpering
flesh
when
the
last
curagh
went
out
i
was
left
on
the
slip
with
a
band
of
women
and
children
and
one
old
boar
who
sat
looking
out
over
the
sea
the
women
were
and
when
i
tried
to
talk
to
them
they
crowded
round
me
and
began
jeering
and
shrieking
at
me
because
i
am
not
married
a
dozen
screamed
at
a
time
and
so
rapidly
that
i
could
not
understand
all
that
they
were
saying
yet
i
was
able
to
make
out
that
they
were
taking
advantage
of
the
absence
of
their
husbands
to
give
me
the
full
volume
of
their
contempt
some
little
boys
who
were
listening
threw
themselves
down
writhing
with
laughter
among
the
seaweed
and
the
young
girls
grew
red
with
embarrassment
and
stared
down
into
the
surf
for
a
moment
i
was
in
confusion
i
tried
to
speak
to
them
but
i
could
not
make
myself
heard
so
i
sat
down
on
the
slip
and
drew
out
my
wallet
of
photographs
in
an
instant
i
had
the
whole
band
clambering
round
me
in
their
ordinary
mood
when
the
curaghs
came
back
one
of
them
towing
a
large
kitchen
table
that
stood
itself
up
on
the
waves
and
then
turned
somersaults
in
an
extraordinary
manner
word
went
round
that
the
ceannuighe
pedlar
was
arriving
he
opened
his
wares
on
the
slip
as
soon
as
he
landed
and
sold
a
quantity
of
cheap
knives
and
jewellery
to
the
girls
and
the
younger
women
he
spoke
no
irish
and
the
bargaining
gave
immense
amusement
to
the
crowd
that
collected
round
him
i
was
surprised
to
notice
that
several
women
who
professed
to
know
no
english
could
make
themselves
understood
without
difficulty
when
it
pleased
them
rings
is
too
dear
at
you
sir
said
one
girl
using
the
gaelic
construction
you
put
less
money
on
them
and
all
the
girls
will
be
buying
after
the
jewellery
he
displayed
some
cheap
religious
pictures
abominable
oleographs
but
i
did
not
see
many
buyers
i
am
told
that
most
of
the
pedlars
who
come
here
are
germans
or
poles
but
i
did
not
have
occasion
to
speak
with
this
man
by
himself
i
have
come
over
for
a
few
days
to
the
south
island
and
as
usual
my
voyage
was
not
favourable
the
morning
was
fine
and
seemed
to
promise
one
of
the
peculiarly
hushed
pellucid
days
that
occur
sometimes
before
rain
in
early
winter
from
the
first
gleam
of
dawn
the
sky
was
covered
with
white
cloud
and
the
tranquillity
was
so
complete
that
every
sound
seemed
to
float
away
by
itself
across
the
silence
of
the
bay
lines
of
blue
smoke
were
going
up
in
spirals
over
the
village
and
further
off
heavy
fragments
of
were
lying
on
the
horizon
we
started
early
in
the
day
and
although
the
sea
looked
calm
from
a
distance
we
met
a
considerable
roll
coming
from
the
when
we
got
out
from
the
shore
near
the
middle
of
the
sound
the
man
who
was
rowing
in
the
bow
broke
his
and
the
proper
management
of
the
canoe
became
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
we
had
only
a
curagh
and
if
the
sea
had
gone
much
higher
we
should
have
run
a
good
deal
of
danger
our
progress
was
so
slow
that
clouds
came
up
with
a
rise
in
the
wind
before
we
reached
the
shore
and
rain
began
to
fall
in
large
single
drops
the
black
curagh
working
slowly
through
this
world
of
grey
and
the
soft
hissing
of
the
rain
gave
me
one
of
the
moods
in
which
we
realise
with
immense
distress
the
short
moment
we
have
left
us
to
experience
all
the
wonder
and
beauty
of
the
world
the
approach
to
the
south
island
is
made
at
a
fine
sandy
beach
on
the
this
interval
in
the
rocks
is
of
great
service
to
the
people
but
the
tract
of
wet
sand
with
a
few
hideous
houses
lately
built
on
it
looks
singularly
desolate
in
broken
weather
the
tide
was
going
out
when
we
landed
so
we
merely
stranded
the
curagh
and
went
up
to
the
little
hotel
the
was
at
work
in
one
of
the
rooms
and
there
were
a
number
of
men
and
boys
waiting
about
who
stared
at
us
while
we
stood
at
the
door
and
talked
to
the
proprietor
when
we
had
had
our
drink
i
went
down
to
the
sea
with
my
men
who
were
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
some
time
was
spent
in
replacing
the
and
then
they
set
out
though
the
wind
was
still
increasing
a
good
many
fishermen
came
down
to
see
the
start
and
long
after
the
curagh
was
out
of
sight
i
stood
and
talked
with
them
in
irish
as
i
was
anxious
to
compare
their
language
and
temperament
with
what
i
knew
of
the
other
island
the
language
seems
to
be
identical
though
some
of
these
men
speak
rather
more
distinctly
than
any
irish
speakers
i
have
yet
heard
in
physical
type
dress
and
general
character
however
there
seems
to
be
a
considerable
difference
the
people
on
this
island
are
more
advanced
than
their
neighbours
and
the
families
here
are
gradually
forming
into
different
ranks
made
up
of
the
the
struggling
and
the
quite
poor
and
thriftless
these
distinctions
are
present
in
the
middle
island
also
but
over
there
they
have
had
no
effect
on
the
people
among
whom
there
is
still
absolute
equality
a
little
later
the
steamer
came
in
sight
and
lay
to
in
the
offing
while
the
curaghs
were
being
put
out
i
noticed
in
the
crowd
several
men
of
the
ragged
humorous
type
that
was
once
thought
to
represent
the
real
peasant
of
ireland
rain
was
now
falling
heavily
and
as
we
looked
out
through
the
fog
there
was
something
nearly
appalling
in
the
shrieks
of
laughter
kept
up
by
one
of
these
individuals
a
man
of
extraordinary
ugliness
and
wit
at
last
he
moved
off
toward
the
houses
wiping
his
eyes
with
the
tail
of
his
coat
and
moaning
to
himself
me
marbh
killed
till
some
one
stopped
him
and
he
began
again
pouring
out
a
medley
of
rude
puns
and
jokes
that
meant
more
than
they
said
there
is
quaint
humour
and
sometimes
wild
humour
on
the
middle
island
but
never
this
ecstasy
of
laughter
perhaps
a
man
must
have
a
sense
of
intimate
misery
not
known
there
before
he
can
set
himself
to
jeer
and
mock
at
the
world
these
strange
men
with
receding
foreheads
high
cheekbones
and
ungovernable
eyes
seem
to
represent
some
old
type
found
on
these
few
acres
at
the
extreme
border
of
europe
where
it
is
only
in
wild
jests
and
laughter
that
they
can
express
their
loneliness
and
desolation
the
mode
of
reciting
ballads
in
this
island
is
singularly
harsh
i
fell
in
with
a
curious
man
beyond
the
east
village
and
we
wandered
out
on
the
rocks
towards
the
sea
a
wintry
shower
came
on
while
we
were
together
and
we
crouched
down
in
the
bracken
under
a
loose
wall
when
we
had
gone
through
the
usual
topics
he
asked
me
if
i
was
fond
of
songs
and
began
singing
to
show
what
he
could
do
the
music
was
much
like
what
i
have
heard
before
on
the
islands
a
monotonous
chant
with
pauses
on
the
high
and
low
notes
to
mark
the
rhythm
but
the
harsh
nasal
tone
in
which
he
sang
was
almost
intolerable
his
performance
reminded
me
in
general
effect
of
a
chant
i
once
heard
from
a
party
of
orientals
i
was
travelling
with
in
a
carriage
from
paris
to
dieppe
but
the
islander
ran
his
voice
over
a
much
wider
range
his
pronunciation
was
lost
in
the
rasping
of
his
throat
and
though
he
shrieked
into
my
ear
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
him
above
the
howling
of
the
wind
i
could
only
make
out
that
it
was
an
endless
ballad
telling
the
fortune
of
a
young
man
who
went
to
sea
and
had
many
adventures
the
english
nautical
terms
were
employed
continually
in
describing
his
life
on
the
ship
but
the
man
seemed
to
feel
that
they
were
not
in
their
place
and
stopped
short
when
one
of
them
occurred
to
give
me
a
poke
with
his
finger
and
explain
gib
topsail
and
bowsprit
which
were
for
me
the
most
intelligible
features
of
the
poem
again
when
the
scene
changed
to
dublin
of
whiskey
and
such
things
were
in
english
when
the
shower
was
over
he
showed
me
a
curious
cave
hidden
among
the
cliffs
a
short
distance
from
the
sea
on
our
way
back
he
asked
me
the
three
questions
i
am
met
with
on
every
side
whether
i
am
a
rich
man
whether
i
am
married
and
whether
i
have
ever
seen
a
poorer
place
than
these
islands
when
he
heard
that
i
was
not
married
he
urged
me
to
come
back
in
the
summer
so
that
he
might
take
me
over
in
a
curagh
to
the
spa
in
county
glare
where
there
is
mor
agus
go
leor
ladies
big
spree
and
plenty
of
ladies
something
about
the
man
repelled
me
while
i
was
with
him
and
though
i
was
cordial
and
liberal
he
seemed
to
feel
that
i
abhorred
him
we
arranged
to
meet
again
in
the
evening
but
when
i
dragged
myself
with
an
inexplicable
loathing
to
the
place
of
meeting
there
was
no
trace
of
him
it
is
characteristic
that
this
man
who
is
probably
a
drunkard
and
shebeener
and
certainly
in
penury
refused
the
chance
of
a
shilling
because
he
felt
that
i
did
not
like
him
he
had
a
curiously
mixed
expression
of
hardness
and
melancholy
probably
his
character
has
given
him
a
bad
reputation
on
the
island
and
he
lives
here
with
the
restlessness
of
a
man
who
has
no
sympathy
with
his
companions
i
have
come
over
again
to
inishmaan
and
this
time
i
had
fine
weather
for
my
passage
the
air
was
full
of
luminous
sunshine
from
the
early
morning
and
it
was
almost
a
summer
day
when
i
set
sail
at
noon
with
michael
and
two
other
men
who
had
come
over
for
me
in
a
curagh
the
wind
was
in
our
favour
so
the
sail
was
put
up
and
michael
sat
in
the
stem
to
steer
with
an
oar
while
i
rowed
with
the
others
we
had
had
a
good
dinner
and
drink
and
were
wrought
up
by
this
sudden
revival
of
summer
to
a
dreamy
voluptuous
gaiety
that
made
us
shout
with
exultation
to
hear
our
voices
passing
out
across
the
blue
twinkling
of
the
sea
even
after
the
people
of
the
south
island
these
men
of
inishmaan
seemed
to
be
moved
by
strange
archaic
sympathies
with
the
world
their
mood
accorded
itself
with
wonderful
fineness
to
the
suggestions
of
the
day
and
their
ancient
gaelic
seemed
so
full
of
divine
simplicity
that
i
would
have
liked
to
turn
the
prow
to
the
west
and
row
with
them
for
ever
i
told
them
i
was
going
back
to
paris
in
a
few
days
to
sell
my
books
and
my
bed
and
that
then
i
was
coming
back
to
grow
as
strong
and
simple
as
they
were
among
the
islands
of
the
west
when
our
excitement
sobered
down
michael
told
me
that
one
of
the
priests
had
left
his
gun
at
our
cottage
and
given
me
leave
to
use
it
till
he
returned
to
the
island
there
was
another
gun
and
a
ferret
in
the
house
also
and
he
said
that
as
soon
as
we
got
home
he
was
going
to
take
me
out
fowling
on
rabbits
a
little
later
in
the
day
we
set
off
and
i
nearly
laughed
to
see
michael
eagerness
that
i
should
turn
out
a
good
shot
we
put
the
ferret
down
in
a
crevice
between
two
bare
sheets
of
rock
and
waited
in
a
few
minutes
we
heard
rushing
paws
underneath
us
then
a
rabbit
shot
up
straight
into
the
air
from
the
crevice
at
our
feet
and
set
off
for
a
wall
that
was
a
few
feet
away
i
threw
up
the
gun
and
fired
tu
e
screamed
michael
at
my
elbow
as
he
ran
up
the
rock
i
had
killed
it
we
shot
seven
or
eight
more
in
the
next
hour
and
michael
was
immensely
pleased
if
i
had
done
badly
i
think
i
should
have
had
to
leave
the
islands
the
people
would
have
despised
me
a
uasal
who
can
not
shoot
seems
to
these
descendants
of
hunters
a
fallen
type
who
is
worse
than
an
apostate
the
women
of
this
island
are
before
conventionality
and
share
some
of
the
liberal
features
that
are
thought
peculiar
to
the
women
of
paris
and
new
york
many
of
them
are
too
contented
and
too
sturdy
to
have
more
than
a
decorative
interest
but
there
are
others
full
of
curious
individuality
this
year
i
have
got
to
know
a
wonderfully
humorous
girl
who
has
been
spinning
in
the
kitchen
for
the
last
few
days
with
the
old
woman
the
morning
she
began
i
heard
her
exquisite
intonation
almost
before
i
awoke
brooding
and
cooing
over
every
syllable
she
uttered
i
have
heard
something
similar
in
the
voices
of
german
and
polish
women
but
i
do
not
think
men
at
least
european
men
who
are
always
further
than
women
from
the
simple
animal
emotions
or
any
speakers
who
use
languages
with
weak
gutturals
like
french
or
english
can
produce
this
inarticulate
chant
in
their
ordinary
talk
she
plays
continual
tricks
with
her
gaelic
in
the
way
girls
are
fond
of
piling
up
diminutives
and
repeating
adjectives
with
a
humorous
scorn
of
syntax
while
she
is
here
the
talk
never
stops
in
the
kitchen
she
has
been
asking
me
many
questions
about
germany
for
it
seems
one
of
her
sisters
married
a
german
husband
in
america
some
years
ago
who
kept
her
in
great
comfort
with
a
fine
glas
horse
to
ride
on
and
this
girl
has
decided
to
escape
in
the
same
way
from
the
drudgery
of
the
island
this
was
my
last
evening
on
my
stool
in
the
chimney
corner
and
i
had
a
long
talk
with
some
neighbours
who
came
in
to
bid
me
prosperity
and
lay
about
on
the
floor
with
their
heads
on
low
stools
and
their
feet
stretched
out
to
the
embers
of
the
turf
the
old
woman
was
at
the
other
side
of
the
fire
and
the
girl
i
have
spoken
of
was
standing
at
her
talking
and
joking
with
every
one
she
says
when
i
go
away
now
i
am
to
marry
a
rich
wife
with
plenty
of
money
and
if
she
dies
on
me
i
am
to
come
back
here
and
marry
herself
for
my
second
wife
i
have
never
heard
talk
so
simple
and
so
attractive
as
the
talk
of
these
people
this
evening
they
began
disputing
about
their
wives
and
it
appeared
that
the
greatest
merit
they
see
in
a
woman
is
that
she
should
be
fruitful
and
bring
them
many
children
as
no
money
can
be
earned
by
children
on
the
island
this
one
attitude
shows
the
immense
difference
between
these
people
and
the
people
of
paris
the
direct
sexual
instincts
are
not
weak
on
the
island
but
they
are
so
subordinated
to
the
instincts
of
the
family
that
they
rarely
lead
to
irregularity
the
life
here
is
still
at
an
almost
patriarchal
stage
and
the
people
are
nearly
as
far
from
the
romantic
moods
of
love
as
they
are
from
the
impulsive
life
of
the
savage
the
wind
was
so
high
this
morning
that
there
was
some
doubt
whether
the
steamer
would
arrive
and
i
spent
half
the
day
wandering
about
with
michael
watching
the
horizon
at
last
when
we
had
given
her
up
she
came
in
sight
far
away
to
the
north
where
she
had
gone
to
have
the
wind
with
her
where
the
sea
was
at
its
highest
i
got
my
baggage
from
the
cottage
and
set
off
for
the
slip
with
michael
and
the
old
man
turning
into
a
cottage
here
and
there
to
say
in
spite
of
the
wind
outside
the
sea
at
the
slip
was
as
calm
as
a
pool
the
men
who
were
standing
about
while
the
steamer
was
at
the
south
island
wondered
for
the
last
time
whether
i
would
be
married
when
i
came
back
to
see
them
then
we
pulled
out
and
took
our
place
in
the
line
as
the
tide
was
running
hard
the
steamer
stopped
a
certain
distance
from
the
shore
and
gave
us
a
long
race
for
good
places
at
her
side
in
the
struggle
we
did
not
come
off
well
so
i
had
to
clamber
across
two
curaghs
twisting
and
fumbling
with
the
roll
in
order
to
get
on
board
it
seemed
strange
to
see
the
curaghs
full
of
faces
turning
back
to
the
slip
without
me
but
the
roll
in
the
sound
soon
took
off
my
attention
some
men
were
on
board
whom
i
had
seen
on
the
south
island
and
a
good
many
kilronan
people
on
their
way
home
from
galway
who
told
me
that
in
one
part
of
their
passage
in
the
morning
they
had
come
in
for
heavy
seas
as
is
usual
on
saturday
the
steamer
had
a
large
cargo
of
flour
and
porter
to
discharge
at
kilronan
and
as
it
was
nearly
four
before
the
tide
could
float
her
at
the
pier
i
felt
some
doubt
about
our
passage
to
galway
the
wind
increased
as
the
afternoon
went
on
and
when
i
came
down
in
the
twilight
i
found
that
the
cargo
was
not
yet
all
unladen
and
that
the
captain
feared
to
face
the
gale
that
was
rising
it
was
some
time
before
he
came
to
a
final
decision
and
we
walked
backwards
and
forwards
from
the
village
with
heavy
clouds
flying
overhead
and
the
wind
howling
in
the
walls
at
last
he
telegraphed
to
galway
to
know
if
he
was
wanted
the
next
day
and
we
went
into
a
to
wait
for
the
reply
the
kitchen
was
filled
with
men
sitting
closely
on
long
forms
ranged
in
lines
at
each
side
of
the
fire
a
but
beautiful
girl
was
kneeling
on
the
hearth
talking
loudly
to
the
men
and
a
few
natives
of
inishmaan
were
hanging
about
the
door
miserably
drunk
at
the
end
of
the
kitchen
the
bar
was
arranged
with
a
sort
of
alcove
beside
it
where
some
older
men
were
playing
cards
overhead
there
were
the
open
rafters
filled
with
turf
and
tobacco
smoke
this
is
the
haunt
so
much
dreaded
by
the
women
of
the
other
islands
where
the
men
linger
with
their
money
till
they
go
out
at
last
with
reeling
steps
and
are
lost
in
the
sound
without
this
background
of
empty
curaghs
and
bodies
floating
naked
with
the
tide
there
would
be
something
almost
absurd
about
the
dissipation
of
this
simple
place
where
men
sit
evening
after
evening
drinking
bad
whisky
and
porter
and
talking
with
endless
repetition
of
fishing
and
kelp
and
of
the
sorrows
of
purgatory
when
we
had
finished
our
whiskey
word
came
that
the
boat
might
remain
with
some
difficulty
i
got
my
bags
out
of
the
steamer
and
carried
them
up
through
the
crowd
of
women
and
donkeys
that
were
still
struggling
on
the
quay
in
an
inconceivable
medley
of
and
cases
of
petroleum
when
i
reached
the
inn
the
old
woman
was
in
great
good
humour
and
i
spent
some
time
talking
by
the
kitchen
fire
then
i
groped
my
way
back
to
the
harbour
where
i
was
told
the
old
who
came
to
see
me
on
my
first
visit
to
the
islands
was
spending
the
night
as
watchman
it
was
quite
dark
on
the
pier
and
a
terrible
gale
was
blowing
there
was
no
one
in
the
little
office
where
i
expected
to
find
him
so
i
groped
my
way
further
on
towards
a
figure
i
saw
moving
with
a
lantern
it
was
the
old
man
and
he
remembered
me
at
once
when
i
hailed
him
and
told
him
who
i
was
he
spent
some
time
arranging
one
of
his
lanterns
and
then
he
took
me
back
to
his
office
a
mere
shed
of
planks
and
corrugated
iron
put
up
for
the
contractor
of
some
work
which
is
in
progress
on
the
pier
when
we
reached
the
light
i
saw
that
his
head
was
rolled
up
in
an
extraordinary
collection
of
mufflers
to
keep
him
from
the
cold
and
that
his
face
was
much
older
than
when
i
saw
him
before
though
still
full
of
intelligence
he
began
to
tell
how
he
had
gone
to
see
a
relative
of
mine
in
dublin
when
he
first
left
the
island
as
a
between
forty
and
fifty
years
ago
he
told
his
story
with
the
usual
detail
we
saw
a
man
walking
about
on
the
quay
in
dublin
and
looking
at
us
without
saying
a
word
then
he
came
down
to
the
yacht
you
the
men
from
aran
said
he
are
said
we
to
come
with
me
so
said
he
said
we
then
he
told
us
it
was
synge
had
sent
him
and
we
went
with
him
synge
brought
us
into
his
kitchen
and
gave
the
men
a
glass
of
whisky
all
round
and
a
to
me
because
i
was
a
boy
though
at
that
time
and
to
this
day
i
can
drink
as
much
as
two
men
and
not
be
the
worse
of
it
we
were
some
time
in
the
kitchen
then
one
of
the
men
said
we
should
be
going
i
said
it
would
not
be
right
to
go
without
saying
a
word
to
synge
then
the
went
up
and
brought
him
down
and
he
gave
us
another
glass
of
whisky
and
he
gave
me
a
book
in
irish
because
i
was
going
to
sea
and
i
was
able
to
read
in
the
irish
i
owe
it
to
synge
and
that
book
that
when
i
came
back
here
after
not
hearing
a
word
of
irish
for
thirty
years
i
had
as
good
irish
or
maybe
better
irish
than
any
person
on
the
island
i
could
see
all
through
his
talk
that
the
sense
of
superiority
which
his
scholarship
in
this
language
gave
him
above
the
ordinary
seaman
had
influenced
his
whole
personality
and
been
the
central
interest
of
his
life
on
one
voyage
he
had
a
who
often
boasted
that
he
had
been
at
school
and
learned
greek
and
this
incident
took
place
one
night
we
had
a
quarrel
and
i
asked
him
could
he
read
a
greek
book
with
all
his
talk
of
it
can
so
said
he
see
that
said
i
then
i
got
the
irish
book
out
of
my
chest
and
i
gave
it
into
his
hand
that
to
me
said
i
you
know
greek
he
took
it
and
he
looked
at
it
this
way
and
that
way
and
not
a
bit
of
him
could
make
it
out
i
forgotten
my
greek
said
he
telling
a
lie
said
i
not
said
he
the
divil
a
bit
i
can
read
it
then
i
took
the
book
back
into
my
hand
and
said
to
him
the
sorra
a
word
of
greek
you
ever
knew
in
your
life
for
there
not
a
word
of
greek
in
that
book
and
not
a
bit
of
you
knew
he
told
me
another
story
of
the
only
time
he
had
heard
irish
spoken
during
his
voyages
one
night
i
was
in
new
york
walking
in
the
streets
with
some
other
men
and
we
came
upon
two
women
quarrelling
in
irish
at
the
door
of
a
that
jargon
said
one
of
the
men
no
jargon
said
i
is
it
said
he
irish
said
i
then
i
went
up
to
them
and
you
know
sir
there
is
no
language
like
the
irish
for
soothing
and
quieting
the
moment
i
spoke
to
them
they
stopped
scratching
and
swearing
and
stood
there
as
quiet
as
two
lambs
then
they
asked
me
in
irish
if
i
would
come
in
and
have
a
drink
and
i
said
i
could
leave
my
mates
them
too
said
they
then
we
all
had
a
drop
together
while
we
were
talking
another
man
had
slipped
in
and
sat
down
in
the
corner
with
his
pipe
and
the
rain
had
become
so
heavy
we
could
hardly
hear
our
voices
over
the
noise
on
the
iron
roof
the
old
man
went
on
telling
of
his
experiences
at
sea
and
the
places
he
had
been
to
i
had
my
life
to
live
over
again
he
said
no
other
way
i
spend
it
i
went
in
and
out
everywhere
and
saw
everything
i
was
never
afraid
to
take
my
glass
though
i
was
never
drunk
in
my
life
and
i
was
a
great
player
of
cards
though
i
never
played
for
money
no
diversion
at
all
in
cards
if
you
do
play
for
said
the
man
in
the
corner
was
no
use
in
my
playing
for
money
said
the
old
man
i
always
lose
and
what
the
use
in
playing
if
you
always
lose
then
our
conversation
branched
off
to
the
irish
language
and
the
books
written
in
it
he
began
to
criticise
archbishop
machale
version
of
moore
irish
melodies
with
great
severity
and
acuteness
citing
whole
poems
both
in
the
english
and
irish
and
then
giving
versions
that
he
had
made
himself
translation
is
no
translation
he
said
it
will
give
you
the
music
of
a
poem
along
with
the
words
of
it
in
my
translation
you
wo
find
a
foot
or
a
syllable
that
not
in
the
english
yet
i
put
down
all
his
words
mean
and
nothing
but
it
archbishop
machale
work
is
a
most
miserable
production
from
the
verses
he
cited
his
judgment
seemed
perfectly
justified
and
even
if
he
was
wrong
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
poor
sailor
and
was
ready
to
rise
up
and
criticise
an
eminent
dignitary
and
scholar
on
rather
delicate
points
of
versification
and
the
finer
distinctions
between
old
words
of
gaelic
in
spite
of
his
singular
intelligence
and
minute
observation
his
reasoning
was
medieval
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
about
the
future
of
the
language
on
these
islands
can
never
die
out
said
he
there
no
family
in
the
place
can
live
without
a
bit
of
a
field
for
potatoes
and
they
have
only
the
irish
words
for
all
that
they
do
in
the
fields
they
sail
their
new
boats
their
hookers
in
english
but
they
sail
a
curagh
oftener
in
irish
and
in
the
fields
they
have
the
irish
alone
it
can
never
die
out
and
when
the
people
begin
to
see
it
fallen
very
low
it
will
rise
up
again
like
the
phoenix
from
its
own
ashes
the
gaelic
league
i
asked
him
gaelic
league
did
they
come
down
here
with
their
organisers
and
their
secretaries
and
their
meetings
and
their
speechifyings
and
start
a
branch
of
it
and
teach
a
power
of
irish
for
five
weeks
and
a
half
a
do
we
want
here
with
their
teaching
irish
said
the
man
in
the
corner
we
irish
enough
have
not
said
the
old
man
not
a
soul
in
aran
can
count
up
to
nine
hundred
and
without
using
an
english
word
but
myself
it
was
getting
late
and
the
rain
had
lessened
for
a
moment
so
i
groped
my
way
back
to
the
inn
through
the
intense
darkness
of
a
late
autumn
night
a
this
was
written
it
should
be
remembered
some
years
ago
part
iv
no
two
journeys
to
these
islands
are
alike
this
morning
i
sailed
with
the
steamer
a
little
after
five
in
a
cold
night
air
with
the
stars
shining
on
the
bay
a
number
of
claddagh
fishermen
had
been
out
all
night
fishing
not
far
from
the
harbour
and
without
thinking
or
perhaps
caring
to
think
of
the
steamer
they
had
put
out
their
nets
in
the
channel
where
she
was
to
pass
just
before
we
started
the
mate
sounded
the
steam
whistle
repeatedly
to
give
them
warning
saying
as
he
did
so
you
were
out
now
in
the
bay
gentlemen
you
hear
some
fine
prayers
being
said
when
we
had
gone
a
little
way
we
began
to
see
the
light
from
the
turf
fires
carried
by
the
fishermen
flickering
on
the
water
and
to
hear
a
faint
noise
of
angry
voices
then
the
outline
of
a
large
came
in
sight
through
the
darkness
with
the
forms
of
three
men
who
stood
on
the
course
the
captain
feared
to
turn
aside
as
there
are
sandbanks
near
the
channel
so
the
engines
were
stopped
and
we
glided
over
the
nets
without
doing
them
harm
as
we
passed
close
to
the
boat
the
crew
could
be
seen
plainly
on
the
deck
one
of
them
holding
the
bucket
of
red
turf
and
their
abuse
could
be
distinctly
heard
it
changed
continually
from
profuse
gaelic
maledictions
to
the
simpler
curses
they
know
in
english
as
they
spoke
they
could
be
seen
writhing
and
twisting
themselves
with
passion
against
the
light
which
was
beginning
to
turn
on
the
ripple
of
the
sea
soon
afterwards
another
set
of
voices
began
in
front
of
us
breaking
out
in
strange
contrast
with
the
dwindling
stars
and
the
silence
of
the
dawn
further
on
we
passed
many
boats
that
let
us
go
by
without
a
word
as
their
nets
were
not
in
the
channel
then
day
came
on
rapidly
with
cold
showers
that
turned
golden
in
the
first
rays
from
the
sun
filling
the
troughs
of
the
sea
with
curious
transparencies
and
light
this
year
i
have
brought
my
fiddle
with
me
so
that
i
may
have
something
new
to
keep
up
the
interest
of
the
people
i
have
played
for
them
several
tunes
but
as
far
as
i
can
judge
they
do
not
feel
modern
music
though
they
listen
eagerly
from
curiosity
irish
airs
like
aroon
please
them
better
but
it
is
only
when
i
play
some
jig
like
the
rogue
which
is
known
on
the
island
that
they
seem
to
respond
to
the
full
meaning
of
the
notes
last
night
i
played
for
a
large
crowd
which
had
come
together
for
another
purpose
from
all
parts
of
the
island
about
six
i
was
going
into
the
schoolmaster
house
and
i
heard
a
fierce
wrangle
going
on
between
a
man
and
a
woman
near
the
cottages
to
the
west
that
lie
below
the
road
while
i
was
listening
to
them
several
women
came
down
to
listen
also
from
behind
the
wall
and
told
me
that
the
people
who
were
fighting
were
near
relations
who
lived
side
by
side
and
often
quarrelled
about
trifles
though
they
were
as
good
friends
as
ever
the
next
day
the
voices
sounded
so
enraged
that
i
thought
mischief
would
come
of
it
but
the
women
laughed
at
the
idea
then
a
lull
came
and
i
said
that
they
seemed
to
have
finished
at
last
said
one
of
the
women
they
have
rightly
begun
it
only
playing
they
are
yet
it
was
just
after
sunset
and
the
evening
was
bitterly
cold
so
i
went
into
the
house
and
left
them
an
hour
later
the
old
man
came
down
from
my
cottage
to
say
that
some
of
the
lads
and
the
lionta
man
of
the
nets
a
young
man
from
aranmor
who
is
teaching
to
the
boys
were
up
at
the
house
and
had
sent
him
down
to
tell
me
they
would
like
to
dance
if
i
would
come
up
and
play
for
them
i
went
out
at
once
and
as
soon
as
i
came
into
the
air
i
heard
the
dispute
going
on
still
to
the
west
more
violently
than
ever
the
news
of
it
had
gone
about
the
island
and
little
bands
of
girls
and
boys
were
running
along
the
lanes
towards
the
scene
of
the
quarrel
as
eagerly
as
if
they
were
going
to
a
racecourse
i
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
door
of
our
cottage
to
listen
to
the
volume
of
abuse
that
was
rising
across
the
stillness
of
the
island
then
i
went
into
the
kitchen
and
began
tuning
the
fiddle
as
the
boys
were
impatient
for
my
music
at
first
i
tried
to
play
standing
but
on
the
upward
stroke
my
bow
came
in
contact
with
the
and
that
hung
from
the
rafters
so
i
settled
myself
at
last
on
a
table
in
the
corner
where
i
was
out
of
the
way
and
got
one
of
the
people
to
hold
up
my
music
before
me
as
i
had
no
stand
i
played
a
french
melody
first
to
get
myself
used
to
the
people
and
the
qualities
of
the
room
which
has
little
resonance
between
the
earth
floor
and
the
thatch
overhead
then
i
struck
up
the
rogue
and
in
a
moment
a
tall
man
bounded
out
from
his
stool
under
the
chimney
and
began
flying
round
the
kitchen
with
peculiarly
sure
and
graceful
bravado
the
lightness
of
the
pampooties
seems
to
make
the
dancing
on
this
island
lighter
and
swifter
than
anything
i
have
seen
on
the
mainland
and
the
simplicity
of
the
men
enables
them
to
throw
a
naive
extravagance
into
their
steps
that
is
impossible
in
places
where
the
people
are
the
speed
however
was
so
violent
that
i
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
up
as
my
fingers
were
not
in
practice
and
i
could
not
take
off
more
than
a
small
part
of
my
attention
to
watch
what
was
going
on
when
i
finished
i
heard
a
commotion
at
the
door
and
the
whole
body
of
people
who
had
gone
down
to
watch
the
quarrel
filed
into
the
kitchen
and
arranged
themselves
around
the
walls
the
women
and
girls
as
is
usual
forming
themselves
in
one
compact
mass
crouching
on
their
heels
near
the
door
i
struck
up
another
dance
get
up
and
the
lionta
and
the
first
dancer
went
through
it
together
with
additional
rapidity
and
grace
as
they
were
excited
by
the
presence
of
the
people
who
had
come
in
then
word
went
round
that
an
old
man
known
as
little
roger
was
outside
and
they
told
me
he
was
once
the
best
dancer
on
the
island
for
a
long
time
he
refused
to
come
in
for
he
said
he
was
too
old
to
dance
but
at
last
he
was
persuaded
and
the
people
brought
him
in
and
gave
him
a
stool
opposite
me
it
was
some
time
longer
before
he
would
take
his
turn
and
when
he
did
so
though
he
was
met
with
great
clapping
of
hands
he
only
danced
for
a
few
moments
he
did
not
know
the
dances
in
my
book
he
said
and
did
not
care
to
dance
to
music
he
was
not
familiar
with
when
the
people
pressed
him
again
he
looked
across
to
me
he
said
in
shaking
english
you
got
larry
grogan
for
it
is
an
agreeable
air
i
had
not
so
some
of
the
young
men
danced
again
to
the
rogue
and
then
the
party
broke
up
the
altercation
was
still
going
on
at
the
cottage
below
us
and
the
people
were
anxious
to
see
what
was
coming
of
it
about
ten
a
young
man
came
in
and
told
us
that
the
fight
was
over
have
been
at
it
for
four
hours
he
said
now
tired
indeed
it
is
time
they
were
for
you
rather
be
listening
to
a
man
killing
a
pig
than
to
the
noise
they
were
letting
out
of
them
after
the
dancing
and
excitement
we
were
too
stirred
up
to
be
sleepy
so
we
sat
for
a
long
time
round
the
embers
of
the
turf
talking
and
smoking
by
the
light
of
the
candle
from
ordinary
music
we
came
to
talk
of
the
music
of
the
fairies
and
they
told
me
this
story
when
i
had
told
them
some
stories
of
my
own
a
man
who
lives
in
the
other
end
of
the
village
got
his
gun
one
day
and
went
out
to
look
for
rabbits
in
a
thicket
near
the
small
dun
he
saw
a
rabbit
sitting
up
under
a
tree
and
he
lifted
his
gun
to
take
aim
at
it
but
just
as
he
had
it
covered
he
heard
a
kind
of
music
over
his
head
and
he
looked
up
into
the
sky
when
he
looked
back
for
the
rabbit
not
a
bit
of
it
was
to
be
seen
he
went
on
after
that
and
he
heard
the
music
again
then
he
looked
over
a
wall
and
he
saw
a
rabbit
sitting
up
by
the
wall
with
a
sort
of
flute
in
its
mouth
and
it
playing
on
it
with
its
two
fingers
sort
of
rabbit
was
that
said
the
old
woman
when
they
had
finished
could
that
be
a
right
rabbit
i
remember
old
pat
dirane
used
to
be
telling
us
he
was
once
out
on
the
cliffs
and
he
saw
a
big
rabbit
sitting
down
in
a
hole
under
a
flagstone
he
called
a
man
who
was
with
him
and
they
put
a
hook
on
the
end
of
a
stick
and
ran
it
down
into
the
hole
then
a
voice
called
up
to
them
ah
phaddrick
do
hurt
me
with
the
hook
was
a
great
rogue
said
the
old
man
you
remember
the
bits
of
horns
he
had
like
handles
on
the
end
of
his
sticks
well
one
day
there
was
a
priest
over
and
he
said
to
pat
is
it
the
devil
horns
you
have
on
your
sticks
pat
i
do
rightly
know
said
pat
but
if
it
is
it
the
devil
milk
you
been
drinking
since
you
been
able
to
drink
and
the
devil
flesh
you
been
eating
and
the
devil
butter
you
been
putting
on
your
bread
for
i
seen
the
like
of
them
horns
on
every
old
cow
through
the
country
the
weather
has
been
rough
but
early
this
afternoon
the
sea
was
calm
enough
for
a
hooker
to
come
in
with
turf
from
connemara
though
while
she
was
at
the
pier
the
roll
was
so
great
that
the
men
had
to
keep
a
watch
on
the
waves
and
loosen
the
cable
whenever
a
large
one
was
coming
in
so
that
she
might
ease
up
with
the
water
there
were
only
two
men
on
board
and
when
she
was
empty
they
had
some
trouble
in
dragging
in
the
cables
hoisting
the
sails
and
getting
out
of
the
harbour
before
they
could
be
blown
on
the
rocks
a
heavy
shower
came
on
soon
afterwards
and
i
lay
down
under
a
stack
of
turf
with
some
people
who
were
standing
about
to
wait
for
another
hooker
that
was
coming
in
with
horses
they
began
talking
and
laughing
about
the
dispute
last
night
and
the
noise
made
at
it
worst
fights
do
be
made
here
over
nothing
said
an
old
man
next
me
mourteen
or
any
of
them
on
the
big
island
ever
tell
you
of
the
fight
they
had
there
threescore
years
ago
when
they
were
killing
each
other
with
knives
out
on
the
strand
never
told
me
i
said
said
he
were
going
down
to
cut
weed
and
a
man
was
sharpening
his
knife
on
a
stone
before
he
went
a
young
boy
came
into
the
kitchen
and
he
said
to
the
man
what
are
you
sharpening
that
knife
for
to
kill
your
father
with
said
the
man
and
they
the
best
of
friends
all
the
time
the
young
boy
went
back
to
his
house
and
told
his
father
there
was
a
man
sharpening
a
knife
to
kill
him
bedad
said
the
father
if
he
has
a
knife
i
have
one
too
sharpened
his
knife
after
that
and
they
went
down
to
the
strand
then
the
two
men
began
making
fun
about
their
knives
and
from
that
they
began
raising
their
voices
and
it
was
long
before
there
were
ten
men
fighting
with
their
knives
and
they
never
stopped
till
there
were
five
of
them
dead
buried
them
the
day
after
and
when
they
were
coming
home
what
did
they
see
but
the
boy
who
began
the
work
playing
about
with
the
son
of
the
other
man
and
their
two
fathers
down
in
their
graves
when
he
stopped
a
gust
of
wind
came
and
blew
up
a
bundle
of
dry
seaweed
that
was
near
us
right
over
our
heads
another
old
man
began
to
talk
was
a
great
wind
he
said
remember
one
time
there
was
a
man
in
the
south
island
who
had
a
lot
of
wool
up
in
shelter
against
the
corner
of
a
wall
he
was
after
washing
it
and
drying
it
and
turning
it
and
he
had
it
all
nice
and
clean
the
way
they
could
card
it
then
a
wind
came
down
and
the
wool
began
blowing
all
over
the
wall
the
man
was
throwing
out
his
arms
on
it
and
trying
to
stop
it
and
another
man
saw
him
the
devil
mend
your
head
says
he
the
like
of
that
wind
is
too
strong
for
you
if
the
devil
himself
is
in
it
said
the
other
man
i
hold
on
to
it
while
i
can
whether
it
was
because
of
the
word
or
not
i
do
know
but
the
whole
of
the
wool
went
up
over
his
head
and
blew
all
over
the
island
yet
when
his
wife
came
to
spin
afterwards
she
had
all
they
expected
as
if
that
lot
was
not
lost
on
them
at
all
was
more
than
that
in
it
said
another
man
the
night
before
a
woman
had
a
great
sight
out
to
the
west
in
this
island
and
saw
all
the
people
that
were
dead
a
while
back
in
this
island
and
the
south
island
and
they
all
talking
with
each
other
there
was
a
man
over
from
the
other
island
that
night
and
he
heard
the
woman
talking
of
what
she
had
seen
the
next
day
he
went
back
to
the
south
island
and
i
think
he
was
alone
in
the
curagh
as
soon
as
he
came
near
the
other
island
he
saw
a
man
fishing
from
the
cliffs
and
this
man
called
out
to
him
make
haste
now
and
go
up
and
tell
your
mother
to
hide
the
poteen
his
mother
used
to
sell
poteen
for
i
after
seeing
the
biggest
party
of
peelers
and
yeomanry
passing
by
on
the
rocks
was
ever
seen
on
the
island
it
was
at
that
time
the
wool
was
taken
with
the
other
man
above
under
the
hill
and
no
peelers
in
the
island
at
all
a
little
after
that
the
old
men
went
away
and
i
was
left
with
some
young
men
between
twenty
and
thirty
who
talked
to
me
of
different
things
one
of
them
asked
me
if
ever
i
was
drunk
and
another
told
me
i
would
be
right
to
marry
a
girl
out
of
this
island
for
they
were
nice
women
in
it
fine
fat
girls
who
would
be
strong
and
have
plenty
of
children
and
not
be
wasting
my
money
on
me
when
the
horses
were
coming
ashore
a
curagh
that
was
far
out
after
came
hurrying
in
and
a
man
out
of
her
ran
up
the
sandhills
to
meet
a
little
girl
who
was
coming
down
with
a
bundle
of
sunday
clothes
he
changed
them
on
the
sand
and
then
went
out
to
the
hooker
and
went
off
to
connemara
to
bring
back
his
horses
a
young
married
woman
i
used
often
to
talk
with
is
dying
of
a
fever
typhus
i
am
told
and
her
husband
and
brothers
have
gone
off
in
a
curagh
to
get
the
doctor
and
the
priest
from
the
north
island
though
the
sea
is
rough
i
watched
them
from
the
dun
for
a
long
time
after
they
had
started
wind
and
rain
were
driving
through
the
sound
and
i
could
see
no
boats
or
people
anywhere
except
this
one
black
curagh
splashing
and
struggling
through
the
waves
when
the
wind
fell
a
little
i
could
hear
people
hammering
below
me
to
the
east
the
body
of
a
young
man
who
was
drowned
a
few
weeks
ago
came
ashore
this
morning
and
his
friends
have
been
busy
all
day
making
a
coffin
in
the
yard
of
the
house
where
he
lived
after
a
while
the
curagh
went
out
of
sight
into
the
mist
and
i
came
down
to
the
cottage
shuddering
with
cold
and
misery
the
old
woman
was
keening
by
the
fire
have
been
to
the
house
where
the
young
man
is
she
said
i
could
go
to
the
door
with
the
air
was
coming
out
of
it
they
say
his
head
is
on
him
at
all
and
indeed
it
is
any
wonder
and
he
three
weeks
in
the
sea
is
it
great
danger
and
sorrow
is
over
every
one
on
this
island
i
asked
her
if
the
curagh
would
soon
be
coming
back
with
the
priest
will
not
be
coming
soon
or
at
all
she
said
wind
has
gone
up
now
and
there
will
come
no
curagh
to
this
island
for
maybe
two
days
or
three
and
was
it
a
cruel
thing
to
see
the
haste
was
on
them
and
they
in
danger
all
the
time
to
be
drowned
themselves
then
i
asked
her
how
the
woman
was
doing
nearly
lost
said
the
old
woman
wo
be
alive
at
all
tomorrow
morning
they
have
no
boards
to
make
her
a
coffin
and
they
want
to
borrow
the
boards
that
a
man
below
has
had
this
two
years
to
bury
his
mother
and
she
alive
still
i
heard
them
saying
there
are
two
more
women
with
the
fever
and
a
child
that
not
three
the
lord
have
mercy
on
us
all
i
went
out
again
to
look
over
the
sea
but
night
had
fallen
and
the
hurricane
was
howling
over
the
dun
i
walked
down
the
lane
and
heard
the
keening
in
the
house
where
the
young
man
was
further
on
i
could
see
a
stir
about
the
door
of
the
cottage
that
had
been
last
struck
by
typhus
then
i
turned
back
again
in
the
teeth
of
the
rain
and
sat
over
the
fire
with
the
old
man
and
woman
talking
of
the
sorrows
of
the
people
till
it
was
late
in
the
night
this
evening
the
old
man
told
me
a
story
he
had
heard
long
ago
on
the
mainland
there
was
a
young
woman
he
said
and
she
had
a
child
in
a
little
time
the
woman
died
and
they
buried
her
the
day
after
that
night
another
woman
a
woman
of
the
family
was
sitting
by
the
fire
with
the
child
on
her
lap
giving
milk
to
it
out
of
a
cup
then
the
woman
they
were
after
burying
opened
the
door
and
came
into
the
house
she
went
over
to
the
fire
and
she
took
a
stool
and
sat
down
before
the
other
woman
then
she
put
out
her
hand
and
took
the
child
on
her
lap
and
gave
it
her
breast
after
that
she
put
the
child
in
the
cradle
and
went
over
to
the
dresser
and
took
milk
and
potatoes
off
it
and
ate
them
then
she
went
out
the
other
woman
was
frightened
and
she
told
the
man
of
the
house
when
he
came
back
and
two
young
men
they
said
they
would
be
there
the
next
night
and
if
she
came
back
they
would
catch
hold
of
her
she
came
the
next
night
and
gave
the
child
her
breast
and
when
she
got
up
to
go
to
the
dresser
the
man
of
the
house
caught
hold
of
her
but
he
fell
down
on
the
floor
then
the
two
young
men
caught
hold
of
her
and
they
held
her
she
told
them
she
was
away
with
the
fairies
and
they
could
not
keep
her
that
night
though
she
was
eating
no
food
with
the
fairies
the
way
she
might
be
able
to
come
back
to
her
child
then
she
told
them
they
would
all
be
leaving
that
part
of
the
country
on
the
oidhche
shamhna
and
that
there
would
be
four
or
five
hundred
of
them
riding
on
horses
and
herself
would
be
on
a
grey
horse
riding
behind
a
young
man
and
she
told
them
to
go
down
to
a
bridge
they
would
be
crossing
that
night
and
to
wait
at
the
head
of
it
and
when
she
would
be
coming
up
she
would
slow
the
horse
and
they
would
be
able
to
throw
something
on
her
and
on
the
young
man
and
they
would
fall
over
on
the
ground
and
be
saved
she
went
away
then
and
on
the
oidhche
shamhna
the
men
went
down
and
got
her
back
she
had
four
children
after
that
and
in
the
end
she
died
it
was
not
herself
they
buried
at
all
the
first
time
but
some
old
thing
the
fairies
put
in
her
place
are
people
who
say
they
do
believe
in
these
things
said
the
old
woman
there
are
strange
things
let
them
say
what
they
will
there
was
a
woman
went
to
bed
at
the
lower
village
a
while
ago
and
her
child
along
with
her
for
a
time
they
did
not
sleep
and
then
something
came
to
the
window
and
they
heard
a
voice
and
this
is
what
it
said
it
is
time
to
sleep
from
this
out
the
morning
the
child
was
dead
and
indeed
it
is
many
get
their
death
that
way
on
the
island
the
young
man
has
been
buried
and
his
funeral
was
one
of
the
strangest
scenes
i
have
met
with
people
could
be
seen
going
down
to
his
house
from
early
in
the
day
yet
when
i
went
there
with
the
old
man
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
coffin
was
still
lying
in
front
of
the
door
with
the
men
and
women
of
the
family
standing
round
beating
it
and
keening
over
it
in
a
great
crowd
of
people
a
little
later
every
one
knelt
down
and
a
last
prayer
was
said
then
the
cousins
of
the
dead
man
got
ready
two
oars
and
some
pieces
of
rope
the
men
of
his
own
family
seemed
too
broken
with
grief
to
know
what
they
were
doing
the
coffin
was
tied
up
and
the
procession
began
the
old
woman
walked
close
behind
the
coffin
and
i
happened
to
take
a
place
just
after
them
among
the
first
of
the
men
the
rough
lane
to
the
graveyard
slopes
away
towards
the
east
and
the
crowd
of
women
going
down
before
me
in
their
red
dresses
cloaked
with
red
pethcoats
with
the
waistband
that
is
held
round
the
head
just
seen
from
behind
had
a
strange
effect
to
which
the
white
coffin
and
the
unity
of
colour
gave
a
nearly
cloistral
quietness
this
time
the
graveyard
was
filled
with
withered
grass
and
bracken
instead
of
the
early
ferns
that
were
to
be
seen
everywhere
at
the
other
funeral
i
have
spoken
of
and
the
grief
of
the
people
was
of
a
different
kind
as
they
had
come
to
bury
a
young
man
who
had
died
in
his
first
manhood
instead
of
an
old
woman
of
eighty
for
this
reason
the
keen
lost
a
part
of
its
formal
nature
and
was
recited
as
the
expression
of
intense
personal
grief
by
the
young
men
and
women
of
the
man
own
family
when
the
coffin
had
been
laid
down
near
the
grave
that
was
to
be
opened
two
long
switches
were
cut
out
from
the
brambles
among
the
rocks
and
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
coffin
were
marked
on
them
then
the
men
began
their
work
clearing
off
stones
and
thin
layers
of
earth
and
breaking
up
an
old
coffin
that
was
in
the
place
into
which
the
new
one
had
to
be
lowered
when
a
number
of
blackened
boards
and
pieces
of
bone
had
been
thrown
up
with
the
clay
a
skull
was
lifted
out
and
placed
upon
a
gravestone
immediately
the
old
woman
the
mother
of
the
dead
man
took
it
up
in
her
hands
and
carried
it
away
by
herself
then
she
sat
down
and
put
it
in
her
lap
it
was
the
skull
of
her
own
mother
and
began
keening
and
shrieking
over
it
with
the
wildest
lamentation
as
the
pile
of
mouldering
clay
got
higher
beside
the
grave
a
heavy
smell
began
to
rise
from
it
and
the
men
hurried
with
their
work
measuring
the
hole
repeatedly
with
the
two
rods
of
bramble
when
it
was
nearly
deep
enough
the
old
woman
got
up
and
came
back
to
the
coffin
and
began
to
beat
on
it
holding
the
skull
in
her
left
hand
this
last
moment
of
grief
was
the
most
terrible
of
all
the
young
women
were
nearly
lying
among
the
stones
worn
out
with
their
passion
of
grief
yet
raising
themselves
every
few
moments
to
beat
with
magnificent
gestures
on
the
boards
of
the
coffin
the
young
men
were
worn
out
also
and
their
voices
cracked
continually
in
the
wail
of
the
keen
when
everything
was
ready
the
sheet
was
unpinned
from
the
coffin
and
it
was
lowered
into
its
place
then
an
old
man
took
a
wooden
vessel
with
holy
water
in
it
and
a
wisp
of
bracken
and
the
people
crowded
round
him
while
he
splashed
the
water
over
them
they
seemed
eager
to
get
as
much
of
it
as
possible
more
than
one
old
woman
crying
out
with
a
humorous
voice
dham
braon
eile
a
mhourteen
me
another
drop
martin
when
the
grave
was
half
filled
in
i
wandered
round
towards
the
north
watching
two
seals
that
were
chasing
each
other
near
the
surf
i
reached
the
sandy
head
as
the
light
began
to
fail
and
found
some
of
the
men
i
knew
best
fishing
there
with
a
sort
of
dragnet
it
is
a
tedious
process
and
i
sat
for
a
long
time
on
the
sand
watching
the
net
being
put
out
and
then
drawn
in
again
by
eight
men
working
together
with
a
slow
rhythmical
movement
as
they
talked
to
me
and
gave
me
a
little
poteen
and
a
little
bread
when
they
thought
i
was
hungry
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
i
was
talking
with
men
who
were
under
a
judgment
of
death
i
knew
that
every
one
of
them
would
be
drowned
in
the
sea
in
a
few
years
and
battered
naked
on
the
rocks
or
would
die
in
his
own
cottage
and
be
buried
with
another
fearful
scene
in
the
graveyard
i
had
come
from
when
i
got
up
this
morning
i
found
that
the
people
had
gone
to
mass
and
latched
the
kitchen
door
from
the
outside
so
that
i
could
not
open
it
to
give
myself
light
i
sat
for
nearly
an
hour
beside
the
fire
with
a
curious
feeling
that
i
should
be
quite
alone
in
this
little
cottage
i
am
so
used
to
sitting
here
with
the
people
that
i
have
never
felt
the
room
before
as
a
place
where
any
man
might
live
and
work
by
himself
after
a
while
as
i
waited
with
just
light
enough
from
the
chimney
to
let
me
see
the
rafters
and
the
greyness
of
the
walls
i
became
indescribably
mournful
for
i
felt
that
this
little
corner
on
the
face
of
the
world
and
the
people
who
live
in
it
have
a
peace
and
dignity
from
which
we
are
shut
for
ever
while
i
was
dreaming
the
old
woman
came
in
in
a
great
hurry
and
made
tea
for
me
and
the
young
priest
who
followed
her
a
little
later
drenched
with
rain
and
spray
the
curate
who
has
charge
of
the
middle
and
south
islands
has
a
wearisome
and
dangerous
task
he
comes
to
this
island
or
inishere
on
saturday
night
whenever
the
sea
is
calm
enough
and
has
mass
the
first
thing
on
sunday
morning
then
he
goes
down
fasting
and
is
rowed
across
to
the
other
island
and
has
mass
again
so
that
it
is
about
midday
when
he
gets
a
hurried
breakfast
before
he
sets
off
again
for
aranmore
meeting
often
on
both
passages
a
rough
and
perilous
sea
a
couple
of
sundays
ago
i
was
lying
outside
the
cottage
in
the
sunshine
smoking
my
pipe
when
the
curate
a
man
of
the
greatest
kindliness
and
humour
came
up
wet
and
worn
out
to
have
his
first
meal
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
shook
his
head
me
he
said
you
read
your
bible
this
morning
i
answered
that
i
had
not
done
so
begod
synge
he
went
on
you
ever
go
to
heaven
you
have
a
great
laugh
at
us
although
these
people
are
kindly
towards
each
other
and
to
their
children
they
have
no
feeling
for
the
sufferings
of
animals
and
little
sympathy
for
pain
when
the
person
who
feels
it
is
not
in
danger
i
have
sometimes
seen
a
girl
writhing
and
howling
with
toothache
while
her
mother
sat
at
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
pointing
at
her
and
laughing
at
her
as
if
amused
by
the
sight
a
few
days
ago
when
we
had
been
talking
of
the
death
of
president
mckinley
i
explained
the
american
way
of
killing
murderers
and
a
man
asked
me
how
long
the
man
who
killed
the
president
would
be
dying
you
be
snapping
your
fingers
i
said
said
the
man
might
as
well
hang
him
so
and
not
be
bothering
themselves
with
all
them
wires
a
man
who
would
kill
a
king
or
a
president
knows
he
has
to
die
for
it
and
it
only
giving
him
the
thing
he
bargained
for
if
he
dies
easy
it
would
be
right
he
should
be
three
weeks
dying
and
there
be
fewer
of
those
things
done
in
the
world
if
two
dogs
fight
at
the
slip
when
we
are
waiting
for
the
steamer
the
men
are
delighted
and
do
all
they
can
to
keep
up
the
fury
of
the
battle
they
tie
down
donkeys
heads
to
their
hoofs
to
keep
them
from
straying
in
a
way
that
must
cause
horrible
pain
and
sometimes
when
i
go
into
a
cottage
i
find
all
the
women
of
the
place
down
on
their
knees
plucking
the
feathers
from
live
ducks
and
geese
when
the
people
are
in
pain
themselves
they
make
no
attempt
to
hide
or
control
their
feelings
an
old
man
who
was
ill
in
the
winter
took
me
out
the
other
day
to
show
me
how
far
down
the
road
they
could
hear
him
yelling
time
he
had
a
pain
in
his
head
there
was
a
great
storm
this
morning
and
i
went
up
on
the
cliff
to
sit
in
the
shanty
they
have
made
there
for
the
men
who
watch
for
wrack
soon
afterwards
a
boy
who
was
out
minding
sheep
came
up
from
the
west
and
we
had
a
long
talk
he
began
by
giving
me
the
first
connected
account
i
have
had
of
the
accident
that
happened
some
time
ago
when
the
young
man
was
drowned
on
his
way
to
the
south
island
men
from
the
south
island
he
said
over
and
bought
some
horses
on
this
island
and
they
put
them
in
a
hooker
to
take
across
they
wanted
a
curagh
to
go
with
them
to
tow
the
horses
on
to
the
strand
and
a
young
man
said
he
would
go
and
they
could
give
him
a
rope
and
tow
him
behind
the
hooker
when
they
were
out
in
the
sound
a
wind
came
down
on
them
and
the
man
in
the
curagh
turn
her
to
meet
the
waves
because
the
hooker
was
pulling
her
and
she
began
filling
up
with
water
the
men
in
the
hooker
saw
it
they
began
crying
out
one
thing
and
another
thing
without
knowing
what
to
do
one
man
called
out
to
the
man
who
was
holding
the
rope
let
go
the
rope
now
or
swamp
her
the
man
with
the
rope
threw
it
out
on
the
water
and
the
curagh
already
and
i
think
only
one
oar
in
her
a
wave
came
into
her
then
and
she
went
down
before
them
and
the
young
man
began
swimming
about
then
they
let
fall
the
sails
in
the
hooker
the
way
they
could
pick
him
up
and
when
they
had
them
down
they
were
too
far
off
and
they
pulled
the
sails
up
again
the
way
they
could
tack
back
to
him
he
was
there
in
the
water
swimming
round
and
swimming
round
and
before
they
got
up
with
him
again
he
sank
the
third
time
and
they
did
see
any
more
of
him
i
asked
if
anyone
had
seen
him
on
the
island
since
he
was
dead
have
not
he
said
there
were
queer
things
in
it
before
he
went
out
on
the
sea
that
day
his
dog
came
up
and
sat
beside
him
on
the
rocks
and
began
crying
when
the
horses
were
coming
down
to
the
slip
an
old
woman
saw
her
son
that
was
drowned
a
while
ago
riding
on
one
of
them
she
did
say
what
she
was
after
seeing
and
this
man
caught
the
horse
he
caught
his
own
horse
first
and
then
he
caught
this
one
and
after
that
he
went
out
and
was
drowned
two
days
after
i
dreamed
they
found
him
on
the
ceann
gaine
the
sandy
head
and
carried
him
up
to
the
house
on
the
plain
and
took
his
pampooties
off
him
and
hung
them
up
on
a
nail
to
dry
it
was
there
they
found
him
afterwards
as
you
have
heard
them
say
you
always
afraid
when
you
hear
a
dog
crying
i
said
do
like
it
he
answered
will
often
see
them
on
the
top
of
the
rocks
looking
up
into
the
heavens
and
they
crying
we
like
it
at
all
and
we
do
like
a
cock
or
hen
to
break
anything
in
the
house
for
we
know
then
some
one
will
be
going
away
a
while
before
the
man
who
used
to
live
in
that
cottage
below
died
in
the
winter
the
cock
belonging
to
his
wife
began
to
fight
with
another
cock
the
two
of
them
flew
up
on
the
dresser
and
knocked
the
glass
of
the
lamp
off
it
and
it
fell
on
the
floor
and
was
broken
the
woman
caught
her
cock
after
that
and
killed
it
but
she
could
not
kill
the
other
cock
for
it
was
belonging
to
the
man
who
lived
in
the
next
house
then
himself
got
a
sickness
and
died
after
that
i
asked
him
if
he
ever
heard
the
fairy
music
on
the
island
heard
some
of
the
boys
talking
in
the
school
a
while
ago
he
said
they
were
saying
that
their
brothers
and
another
man
went
out
fishing
a
morning
two
weeks
ago
before
the
cock
crew
when
they
were
down
near
the
sandy
head
they
heard
music
near
them
and
it
was
the
fairies
were
in
it
i
heard
of
other
things
too
one
time
three
men
were
out
at
night
in
a
curagh
and
they
saw
a
big
ship
coming
down
on
them
they
were
frightened
at
it
and
they
tried
to
get
away
but
it
came
on
nearer
them
till
one
of
the
men
turned
round
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
then
they
did
see
it
any
more
then
he
went
on
in
answer
to
another
question
do
often
see
the
people
who
do
be
away
with
them
there
was
a
young
man
died
a
year
ago
and
he
used
to
come
to
the
window
of
the
house
where
his
brothers
slept
and
be
talking
to
them
in
the
night
he
was
married
a
while
before
that
and
he
used
to
be
saying
in
the
night
he
was
sorry
he
had
not
promised
the
land
to
his
son
and
that
it
was
to
him
it
should
go
another
time
he
was
saying
something
about
a
mare
about
her
hoofs
or
the
shoes
they
should
put
on
her
a
little
while
ago
patch
ruadh
saw
him
going
down
the
road
with
brogaarda
leather
boots
on
him
and
a
new
suit
then
two
men
saw
him
in
another
place
you
see
that
straight
wall
of
cliff
he
went
on
a
few
minutes
later
pointing
to
a
place
below
us
is
there
the
fairies
do
be
playing
ball
in
the
night
and
you
can
see
the
marks
of
their
heels
when
you
come
in
the
morning
and
three
stones
they
have
to
mark
the
line
and
another
big
stone
they
hop
the
ball
on
it
often
the
boys
have
put
away
the
three
stones
and
they
will
always
be
back
again
in
the
morning
and
a
while
since
the
man
who
owns
the
land
took
the
big
stone
itself
and
rolled
it
down
and
threw
it
over
the
cliff
yet
in
the
morning
it
was
back
in
its
place
before
him
i
am
in
the
south
island
again
and
i
have
come
upon
some
old
men
with
a
wonderful
variety
of
stories
and
songs
the
last
fairly
often
both
in
english
and
irish
i
went
round
to
the
house
of
one
of
them
with
a
native
scholar
who
can
write
irish
and
we
took
down
a
certain
number
and
heard
others
here
is
one
of
the
tales
the
old
man
told
us
at
first
before
he
had
warmed
to
his
subject
i
did
not
take
it
down
but
it
ran
in
this
way
there
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
charley
lambert
and
every
horse
he
would
ride
in
a
race
he
would
come
in
the
first
the
people
in
the
country
were
angry
with
him
at
last
and
this
law
was
made
that
he
should
ride
no
more
at
races
and
if
he
rode
any
one
who
saw
him
would
have
the
right
to
shoot
him
after
that
there
was
a
gentleman
from
that
part
of
the
country
over
in
england
and
he
was
talking
one
day
with
the
people
there
and
he
said
that
the
horses
of
ireland
were
the
best
horses
the
english
said
it
was
the
english
horses
were
the
best
and
at
last
they
said
there
should
be
a
race
and
the
english
horses
would
come
over
and
race
against
the
horses
of
ireland
and
the
gentleman
put
all
his
money
on
that
race
well
when
he
came
back
to
ireland
he
went
to
charley
lambert
and
asked
him
to
ride
on
his
horse
charley
said
he
would
not
ride
and
told
the
gentleman
the
danger
he
be
in
then
the
gentleman
told
him
the
way
he
had
put
all
his
property
on
the
horse
and
at
last
charley
asked
where
the
races
were
to
be
and
the
hour
and
the
day
the
gentleman
told
him
you
put
a
horse
with
a
bridle
and
saddle
on
it
every
seven
miles
along
the
road
from
here
to
the
racecourse
on
that
day
said
lambert
i
be
in
it
when
the
gentleman
was
gone
charley
stripped
off
his
clothes
and
got
into
his
bed
then
he
sent
for
the
doctor
and
when
he
heard
him
coming
he
began
throwing
about
his
arms
the
way
the
doctor
would
think
his
pulse
was
up
with
the
fever
the
doctor
felt
his
pulse
and
told
him
to
stay
quiet
till
the
next
day
when
he
would
see
him
again
the
next
day
it
was
the
same
thing
and
so
on
till
the
day
of
the
races
that
morning
charley
had
his
pulse
beating
so
hard
the
doctor
thought
bad
of
him
going
to
the
races
now
charley
said
he
i
come
in
and
see
you
again
when
i
be
coming
back
in
the
evening
and
let
you
be
very
careful
and
quiet
till
you
see
me
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
charley
leapt
up
out
of
bed
and
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
seven
miles
to
where
the
first
horse
was
waiting
for
him
then
he
rode
that
horse
seven
miles
and
another
horse
seven
miles
more
till
he
came
to
the
racecourse
he
rode
on
the
gentleman
horse
and
he
won
the
race
there
were
great
crowds
looking
on
and
when
they
saw
him
coming
in
they
said
it
was
charley
lambert
or
the
devil
was
in
it
for
there
was
no
one
else
could
bring
in
a
horse
the
way
he
did
for
the
leg
was
after
being
knocked
off
of
the
horse
and
he
came
in
all
the
same
when
the
race
was
over
he
got
up
on
the
horse
was
waiting
for
him
and
away
with
him
for
seven
miles
then
he
rode
the
other
horse
seven
miles
and
his
own
horse
seven
miles
and
when
he
got
home
he
threw
off
his
clothes
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
after
a
while
the
doctor
came
back
and
said
it
was
a
great
race
they
were
after
having
the
next
day
the
people
were
saying
it
was
charley
lambert
was
the
man
who
rode
the
horse
an
inquiry
was
held
and
the
doctor
swore
that
charley
was
ill
in
his
bed
and
he
had
seen
him
before
the
race
and
after
it
so
the
gentleman
saved
his
fortune
after
that
he
told
me
another
story
of
the
same
sort
about
a
fairy
rider
who
met
a
gentleman
that
was
after
losing
all
his
fortune
but
a
shilling
and
begged
the
shilling
of
him
the
gentleman
gave
him
the
shilling
and
the
fairy
rider
a
little
red
man
rode
a
horse
for
him
in
a
race
waving
a
red
handkerchief
to
him
as
a
signal
when
he
was
to
double
the
stakes
and
made
him
a
rich
man
then
he
gave
us
an
extraordinary
english
doggerel
rhyme
which
i
took
down
though
it
seems
singularly
incoherent
when
written
out
at
length
these
rhymes
are
repeated
by
the
old
men
as
a
sort
of
chant
and
when
a
line
comes
that
is
more
than
usually
irregular
they
seem
to
take
a
real
delight
in
forcing
it
into
the
mould
of
the
recitative
all
the
time
he
was
chanting
the
old
man
kept
up
a
kind
of
snakelike
movement
in
his
body
which
seemed
to
fit
the
chant
and
make
it
part
of
him
the
white
horse
my
horse
he
is
white
though
at
first
he
was
bay
and
he
took
great
delight
in
travelling
by
night
and
by
day
his
travels
were
great
if
i
could
but
half
of
them
tell
he
was
rode
in
the
garden
by
adam
the
day
that
he
fell
on
babylon
plains
he
ran
with
speed
for
the
plate
he
was
hunted
next
day
by
hannibal
the
great
after
that
he
was
hunted
in
the
chase
of
a
fox
when
nebuchadnezzar
ate
grass
in
the
shape
of
an
ox
we
are
told
in
the
next
verses
of
his
going
into
the
ark
with
noah
of
moses
riding
him
through
the
red
sea
then
he
was
with
king
pharaoh
in
egypt
when
fortune
did
smile
and
he
rode
him
stately
along
the
gay
banks
of
the
nile
he
was
with
king
saul
and
all
his
troubles
went
through
he
was
with
king
david
the
day
that
goliath
he
slew
for
a
few
verses
he
is
with
juda
and
maccabeus
the
great
with
cyrus
and
back
again
to
babylon
next
we
find
him
as
the
horse
that
came
into
troy
when
came
to
troy
with
joy
my
horse
he
was
found
he
crossed
over
the
walls
and
entered
the
city
i
told
i
come
on
him
again
in
spain
and
he
in
full
bloom
by
hannibal
the
great
he
was
rode
and
he
crossing
the
alps
into
rome
the
horse
being
tall
and
the
alps
very
high
his
rider
did
fall
and
hannibal
the
great
lost
an
eye
afterwards
he
carries
young
sipho
scipio
and
then
he
is
ridden
by
brian
when
driving
the
danes
from
ireland
and
by
ruth
when
he
fell
at
the
battle
of
aughrim
and
by
sarsfield
at
the
siege
of
limerick
he
was
with
king
james
who
sailed
to
the
irish
shore
but
at
last
he
got
lame
when
the
boyne
bloody
battle
was
he
was
rode
by
the
greatest
of
men
at
famed
waterloo
brave
daniel
he
sat
on
his
back
it
is
true
brave
dan
on
his
back
he
ready
once
more
for
the
field
he
never
will
stop
till
the
tories
he
make
them
to
yield
grotesque
as
this
long
rhyme
appears
it
has
as
i
said
a
sort
of
existence
when
it
is
crooned
by
the
old
man
at
his
fireside
and
it
has
great
fame
in
the
island
the
old
man
himself
is
hoping
that
i
will
print
it
for
it
would
not
be
fair
he
says
that
it
should
die
out
of
the
world
and
he
is
the
only
man
here
who
knows
it
and
none
of
them
have
ever
heard
it
on
the
mainland
he
has
a
couple
more
examples
of
the
same
kind
of
doggerel
but
i
have
not
taken
them
down
both
in
english
and
in
irish
the
songs
are
full
of
words
the
people
do
not
understand
themselves
and
when
they
come
to
say
the
words
slowly
their
memory
is
usually
uncertain
all
the
morning
i
have
been
digging
maidenhair
ferns
with
a
boy
i
met
on
the
rocks
who
was
in
great
sorrow
because
his
father
died
suddenly
a
week
ago
of
a
pain
in
his
heart
would
have
chosen
to
lose
our
father
for
all
the
gold
there
is
in
the
world
he
said
it
great
loneliness
and
sorrow
there
is
in
the
house
now
then
he
told
me
that
a
brother
of
his
who
is
a
stoker
in
the
navy
had
come
home
a
little
while
before
his
father
died
and
that
he
had
spent
all
his
money
in
having
a
fine
funeral
with
plenty
of
drink
at
it
and
tobacco
brother
has
been
a
long
way
in
the
world
he
said
seen
great
wonders
he
does
be
telling
us
of
the
people
that
do
come
out
to
them
from
italy
and
spain
and
portugal
and
that
it
is
a
sort
of
irish
they
do
be
talking
not
english
at
all
though
it
is
only
a
word
here
and
there
you
understand
when
we
had
dug
out
enough
of
roots
from
the
deep
crannies
in
the
rocks
where
they
are
only
to
be
found
i
gave
my
companion
a
few
pence
and
sent
him
back
to
his
cottage
the
old
man
who
tells
me
the
irish
poems
is
curiously
pleased
with
the
translations
i
have
made
from
some
of
them
he
would
never
be
tired
he
says
listening
while
i
would
be
reading
them
and
they
are
much
finer
things
than
his
old
bits
of
rhyme
here
is
one
of
them
as
near
the
irish
as
i
am
able
to
make
it
rucard
mor
i
put
the
sorrow
of
destruction
on
the
bad
luck
for
it
would
be
a
pity
ever
to
deny
it
it
is
to
me
it
is
stuck
by
loneliness
my
pain
my
complaining
it
is
the
put
me
and
took
from
me
my
goods
of
the
world
at
mannistir
na
ruaidthe
it
is
on
me
the
shameless
deed
was
done
finn
bheara
and
his
took
my
little
horse
on
me
from
under
the
bag
if
they
left
me
the
skin
it
would
bring
me
tobacco
for
three
months
but
they
did
not
leave
anything
with
me
but
the
old
minister
in
its
place
am
not
i
to
be
pitied
my
bond
and
my
note

on
her
and

her

loneliness
my
pain

complaining

i
made
a
hunting
cap
for
conal
cath
of
her
yesterday
i
ran
off
on
my
walking
through
roads
that
were
cold
and
dirty
i
fell
in
with
the
and
he
lying
down
in
the
ruadthe
pity
a
man
without
a
cow
i
pity
a
man
without
a
sheep
but
in
the
case
of
a
man
without
a
horse
it
is
hard
for
him
to
be
long
in
the
world
this
morning
when
i
had
been
lying
for
a
long
time
on
a
rock
near
the
sea
watching
some
hooded
crows
that
were
dropping
shellfish
on
the
rocks
to
break
them
i
saw
one
bird
that
had
a
large
white
object
which
it
was
dropping
continually
without
any
result
i
got
some
stones
and
tried
to
drive
it
off
when
the
thing
had
fallen
but
several
times
the
bird
was
too
quick
for
me
and
made
off
with
it
before
i
could
get
down
to
him
at
last
however
i
dropped
a
stone
almost
on
top
of
him
and
he
flew
away
i
clambered
down
hastily
and
found
to
my
amazement
a
worn
no
doubt
it
had
been
brought
out
in
some
way
or
other
from
the
links
in
county
glare
which
are
not
far
off
and
the
bird
had
been
trying
half
the
morning
to
break
it
further
on
i
had
a
long
talk
with
a
young
man
who
is
inquisitive
about
modern
life
and
i
explained
to
him
an
elaborate
trick
or
corner
on
the
stock
exchange
that
i
heard
of
lately
when
i
got
him
to
understand
it
fully
he
shouted
with
delight
and
amusement
he
said
when
he
was
quiet
again
it
a
great
wonder
to
think
that
those
rich
men
are
as
big
rogues
as
ourselves
the
old
has
given
me
a
long
rhyme
about
a
man
who
fought
with
an
eagle
it
is
rather
irregular
and
has
some
obscure
passages
but
i
have
translated
it
with
the
scholar
phelim
and
the
eagle
on
my
getting
up
in
the
morning
and
i
bothered
on
a
sunday
i
put
my
brogues
on
me
and
i
going
to
tierny
in
the
glen
of
the
dead
people
it
is
there
the
big
eagle
fell
in
with
me
he
like
a
black
stack
of
turf
sitting
up
stately
i
called
him
a
lout
and
a
fool
the
son
of
a
female
and
a
fool
of
the
race
of
the
clan
cleopas
the
biggest
rogues
in
the
land
that
and
my
seven
curses
and
never
a
good
day
to
be
on
you
who
stole
my
little
cock
from
me
that
could
crow
the
sweetest
your
wits
right
in
you
and
do
curse
me
too
greatly
by
my
strength
and
my
oath
i
never
took
rent
of
you
i
did
grudge
what
you
would
have
to
spare
in
the
house
of
the
burnt
pigeons
it
is
always
useful
you
were
to
men
of
business
get
off
home
and
ask
nora
what
name
was
on
the
young
woman
that
scalded
his
head
the
feathers
there
were
on
his
ribs
are
burnt
on
the
hearth
and
they
eat
him
and
they
taking
and
it
was
much
were
thankful
are
a
liar

stealer
they
did
not
eat
him

me
and

harvest
quarter

take
a
tax
of
you

lost
the
fianna

was
a
fine
boy
i
was
it
was
not
about
thieving
was
my
knowledge
but
always
putting
spells
playing
games
and
matches
with
the
strength
of
gol
macmorna
and
you
are
making
me
a
rogue
at
the
end
of
my
life
is
a
part
of
my
father
books
with
me
keeping
in
the
bottom
of
a
box
and
when
i
read
them
the
tears
fall
down
from
me
but
i
found
out
in
history
that
you
are
a
son
of
the
dearg
mor
if
it
is
fighting
you
want
and
you
wo
be
thankful
the
eagle
dressed
his
bravery
with
his
share
of
arms
and
his
clothes
he
had
the
sword
that
was
the
sharpest
could
be
got
anywhere
i
and
my
scythe
with
me
and
nothing
on
but
my
shirt
we
went
at
each
other
early
in
the
day
we
were
as
two
giants
ploughing
in
a
valley
in
a
glen
of
the
mountains
we
did
not
know
for
the
while
which
was
the
better
man
you
could
hear
the
shakes
that
were
on
our
arms
under
each
other
from
that
till
the
sunset
till
it
was
forced
on
him
to
give
up
i
wrote
a
boxail
to
him
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
to
come
till
we
would
fight
without
doubt
at
the
dawn
of
the
day
the
second
fist
i
drew
on
him
i
struck
him
on
the
hone
of
his
jaw
he
fell
and
it
is
no
lie
there
was
a
cloud
in
his
head
the
eagle
stood
up
he
took
the
end
of
my
hand
are
the
finest
man
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
go
off
home
my
blessing
will
be
on
you
for
ever
you
have
saved
the
fame
of
eire
for
yourself
till
the
day
of
the
judgment
ah
neighbors
did
you
hear
the
goodness
and
power
of
felim
the
biggest
wild
beast
you
could
get
the
second
fist
he
drew
on
it
he
struck
it
on
the
jaw
it
fell
and
it
did
not
rise
till
the
end
of
two
days
well
as
i
seem
to
know
these
people
of
the
islands
there
is
hardly
a
day
that
i
do
not
come
upon
some
new
primitive
feature
of
their
life
yesterday
i
went
into
a
cottage
where
the
woman
was
at
work
and
very
carelessly
dressed
she
waited
for
a
while
till
i
got
into
conversation
with
her
husband
and
then
she
slipped
into
the
corner
and
put
on
a
clean
petticoat
and
a
bright
shawl
round
her
neck
then
she
came
back
and
took
her
place
at
the
fire
this
evening
i
was
in
another
cottage
till
very
late
talking
to
the
people
when
the
little
boy
the
only
child
of
the
house
got
sleepy
the
old
grandmother
took
him
on
her
lap
and
began
singing
to
him
as
soon
as
he
was
drowsy
she
worked
his
clothes
off
him
by
degrees
scratching
him
softly
with
her
nails
as
she
did
so
all
over
his
body
then
she
washed
his
feet
with
a
little
water
out
of
a
pot
and
put
him
into
his
bed
when
i
was
going
home
the
wind
was
driving
the
sand
into
my
face
so
that
i
could
hardly
find
my
way
i
had
to
hold
my
hat
over
my
mouth
and
nose
and
my
hand
over
my
eyes
while
i
groped
along
with
my
feet
feeling
for
rocks
and
holes
in
the
sand
i
have
been
sitting
all
the
morning
with
an
old
man
who
was
making
sugawn
ropes
for
his
house
and
telling
me
stories
while
he
worked
he
was
a
pilot
when
he
was
young
and
we
had
great
talk
at
first
about
germans
and
italians
and
russians
and
the
ways
of
seaport
towns
then
he
came
round
to
talk
of
the
middle
island
and
he
told
me
this
story
which
shows
the
curious
jealousy
that
is
between
the
islands
long
ago
we
used
all
to
be
pagans
and
the
saints
used
to
be
coming
to
teach
us
about
god
and
the
creation
of
the
world
the
people
on
the
middle
island
were
the
last
to
keep
a
hold
on
the
or
whatever
it
was
they
had
in
those
days
but
in
the
long
run
a
saint
got
in
among
them
and
they
began
listening
to
him
though
they
would
often
say
in
the
evening
they
believed
and
then
say
the
morning
after
that
they
did
not
believe
in
the
end
the
saint
gained
them
over
and
they
began
building
a
church
and
the
saint
had
tools
that
were
in
use
with
them
for
working
with
the
stones
when
the
church
was
halfway
up
the
people
held
a
kind
of
meeting
one
night
among
themselves
when
the
saint
was
asleep
in
his
bed
to
see
if
they
did
really
believe
and
no
mistake
in
it
the
leading
man
got
up
and
this
is
what
he
said
that
they
should
go
down
and
throw
their
tools
over
the
cliff
for
if
there
was
such
a
man
as
god
and
if
the
saint
was
as
well
known
to
him
as
he
said
then
he
would
be
as
well
able
to
bring
up
the
tools
out
of
the
sea
as
they
were
to
throw
them
in
they
went
then
and
threw
their
tools
over
the
cliff
when
the
saint
came
down
to
the
church
in
the
morning
the
workmen
were
all
sitting
on
the
stones
and
no
work
doing
what
cause
are
you
idle
asked
the
saint
have
no
tools
said
the
men
and
then
they
told
him
the
story
of
what
they
had
done
he
kneeled
down
and
prayed
god
that
the
tools
might
come
up
out
of
the
sea
and
after
that
he
prayed
that
no
other
people
might
ever
be
as
great
fools
as
the
people
on
the
middle
island
and
that
god
might
preserve
theft
dark
minds
of
folly
to
them
fill
the
end
of
the
world
and
that
is
why
no
man
out
of
that
island
can
tell
you
a
whole
story
without
stammering
or
bring
any
work
to
end
without
a
fault
in
it
i
asked
him
if
he
had
known
old
pat
dirane
on
the
middle
island
and
heard
the
fine
stories
he
used
to
tell
one
knew
him
better
than
i
did
he
said
i
do
often
be
in
that
island
making
curaghs
for
the
people
one
day
old
pat
came
down
to
me
when
i
was
after
tarring
a
new
curagh
and
he
asked
me
to
put
a
little
tar
on
the
knees
of
his
breeches
the
way
the
rain
come
through
on
him
took
the
brush
in
my
hand
and
i
had
him
tarred
down
to
his
feet
before
he
knew
what
i
was
at
turn
round
the
other
side
now
i
said
and
you
be
able
to
sit
where
you
like
then
he
felt
the
tar
coming
in
hot
against
his
skin
and
he
began
cursing
my
soul
and
i
was
sorry
for
the
trick
i
played
on
him
this
old
man
was
the
same
type
as
the
genial
whimsical
old
men
one
meets
all
through
ireland
and
had
none
of
the
local
characteristics
that
are
so
marked
on
lnishmaan
when
we
were
tired
talking
i
showed
some
of
my
tricks
and
a
little
crowd
collected
when
they
were
gone
another
old
man
who
had
come
up
began
telling
us
about
the
fairies
one
night
when
he
was
coming
home
from
the
lighthouse
he
heard
a
man
riding
on
the
road
behind
him
and
he
stopped
to
wait
for
him
but
nothing
came
then
he
heard
as
if
there
was
a
man
trying
to
catch
a
horse
on
the
rocks
and
in
a
little
time
he
went
on
the
noise
behind
him
got
bigger
as
he
went
along
as
if
twenty
horses
and
then
as
if
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
were
galloping
after
him
when
he
came
to
the
stile
where
he
had
to
leave
the
road
and
got
out
over
it
something
hit
against
him
and
threw
him
down
on
the
rock
and
a
gun
he
had
in
his
hand
fell
into
the
field
beyond
him
asked
the
priest
we
had
at
that
time
what
was
in
it
he
said
the
priest
told
me
it
was
the
fallen
angels
and
i
do
know
but
it
was
time
he
went
on
was
coming
down
where
there
is
a
bit
of
a
cliff
and
a
little
hole
under
it
and
i
heard
a
flute
playing
in
the
hole
or
beside
it
and
that
was
before
the
dawn
began
whatever
anyone
says
there
are
strange
things
there
was
one
night
thirty
years
ago
a
man
came
down
to
get
my
wife
to
go
up
to
his
wife
for
she
was
in
childbed
was
something
to
do
with
the
lighthouse
or
the
coastguard
one
of
them
protestants
who
do
believe
in
any
of
these
things
and
do
be
making
fun
of
us
well
he
asked
me
to
go
down
and
get
a
quart
of
spirits
while
my
wife
would
be
getting
herself
ready
and
he
said
he
would
go
down
along
with
me
if
i
was
afraid
said
i
was
not
afraid
and
i
went
by
myself
i
was
coming
back
there
was
something
on
the
path
and
i
a
foolish
fellow
i
might
have
gone
to
one
side
or
the
other
over
the
sand
but
i
went
on
straight
till
i
was
near
it
till
i
was
too
near
it
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
heard
them
saying
none
of
those
creatures
can
stand
before
you
and
you
saying
the
de
profundis
so
i
began
saying
it
and
the
thing
ran
off
over
the
sand
and
i
got
home
of
the
people
used
to
say
it
was
only
an
old
jackass
that
was
on
the
path
before
me
but
i
never
heard
tell
of
an
old
jackass
would
run
away
from
a
man
and
he
saying
the
de
profundis
i
told
him
the
story
of
the
fairy
ship
which
had
disappeared
when
the
man
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
as
i
had
heard
it
on
the
middle
island
do
be
strange
things
on
the
sea
he
said
night
i
was
down
there
where
you
can
see
that
green
point
and
i
saw
a
ship
coming
in
and
i
wondered
what
it
would
be
doing
coming
so
close
to
the
rocks
it
came
straight
on
towards
the
place
i
was
in
and
then
i
got
frightened
and
i
ran
up
to
the
houses
and
when
the
captain
saw
me
running
he
changed
his
course
and
went
away
i
used
to
go
out
as
a
pilot
at
that
time
i
went
a
few
times
only
well
one
sunday
a
man
came
down
and
said
there
was
a
big
ship
coming
into
the
sound
i
ran
down
with
two
men
and
we
went
out
in
a
curagh
we
went
round
the
point
where
they
said
the
ship
was
and
there
was
no
ship
in
it
as
it
was
a
sunday
we
had
nothing
to
do
and
it
was
a
fine
calm
day
so
we
rowed
out
a
long
way
looking
for
the
ship
till
i
was
further
than
i
ever
was
before
or
after
when
i
wanted
to
turn
back
we
saw
a
great
flock
of
birds
on
the
water
and
they
all
black
without
a
white
bird
through
them
they
had
no
fear
of
us
at
all
and
the
men
with
me
wanted
to
go
up
to
them
so
we
went
further
when
we
were
quite
close
they
got
up
so
many
that
they
blackened
the
sky
and
they
lit
down
again
a
hundred
or
maybe
a
hundred
and
twenty
yards
off
we
went
after
them
again
and
one
of
the
men
wanted
to
kill
one
with
a
and
the
other
man
wanted
to
kill
one
with
his
rowing
stick
i
was
afraid
they
would
upset
the
curagh
but
they
would
go
after
the
birds
we
were
quite
close
one
man
threw
the
pin
and
the
other
man
hit
at
them
with
his
rowing
stick
and
the
two
of
them
fell
over
in
the
curagh
and
she
turned
on
her
side
and
only
it
was
quite
calm
the
lot
of
us
were
drowned
think
those
black
gulls
and
the
ship
were
the
same
sort
and
after
that
i
never
went
out
again
as
a
pilot
it
is
often
curaghs
go
out
to
ships
and
find
there
is
no
ship
while
ago
a
curagh
went
out
to
a
ship
from
the
big
island
and
there
was
no
ship
and
all
the
men
in
the
curagh
were
drowned
a
fine
song
was
made
about
them
after
that
though
i
never
heard
it
myself
day
a
curagh
was
out
fishing
from
this
island
and
the
men
saw
a
hooker
not
far
from
them
and
they
rowed
up
to
it
to
get
a
light
for
their
pipes
at
that
time
there
were
no
matches
and
when
they
up
to
the
big
boat
it
was
gone
out
of
its
place
and
they
were
in
great
fear
then
he
told
me
a
story
he
had
got
from
the
mainland
about
a
man
who
was
driving
one
night
through
the
country
and
met
a
woman
who
came
up
to
him
and
asked
him
to
take
her
into
his
cart
he
thought
something
was
not
right
about
her
and
he
went
on
when
he
had
gone
a
little
way
he
looked
back
and
it
was
a
pig
was
on
the
road
and
not
a
woman
at
all
he
thought
he
was
a
done
man
but
he
went
on
when
he
was
going
through
a
wood
further
on
two
men
came
out
to
him
one
from
each
side
of
the
road
and
they
took
hold
of
the
bridle
of
the
horse
and
led
it
on
between
them
they
were
old
stale
men
with
frieze
clothes
on
them
and
the
old
fashions
when
they
came
out
of
the
wood
he
found
people
as
if
there
was
a
fair
on
the
road
with
the
people
buying
and
selling
and
they
not
living
people
at
all
the
old
men
took
him
through
the
crowd
and
then
they
left
him
when
he
got
home
and
told
the
old
people
of
the
two
old
men
and
the
ways
and
fashions
they
had
about
them
the
old
people
told
him
it
was
his
two
grandfathers
had
taken
care
of
him
for
they
had
had
a
great
love
for
him
and
he
a
lad
growing
up
this
evening
we
had
a
dance
in
the
inn
parlour
where
a
fire
had
been
lighted
and
the
tables
had
been
pushed
into
the
corners
there
was
no
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
when
i
had
played
two
or
three
jigs
and
other
tunes
on
my
fiddle
there
was
a
pause
as
i
did
not
know
how
much
of
my
music
the
people
wanted
or
who
else
could
be
got
to
sing
or
play
for
a
moment
a
deadlock
seemed
to
be
coming
but
a
young
girl
i
knew
fairly
well
saw
my
difficulty
and
took
the
management
of
our
festivities
into
her
hands
at
first
she
asked
a
coastguard
daughter
to
play
a
reel
on
the
mouth
organ
which
she
did
at
once
with
admirable
spirit
and
rhythm
then
the
little
girl
asked
me
to
play
again
telling
me
what
i
should
choose
and
went
on
in
the
same
way
managing
the
evening
till
she
thought
it
was
time
to
go
home
then
she
stood
up
thanked
me
in
irish
and
walked
out
of
the
door
without
looking
at
anybody
but
followed
almost
at
once
by
the
whole
party
when
they
had
gone
i
sat
for
a
while
on
a
barrel
in
the
talking
to
some
young
men
who
were
reading
a
paper
in
irish
then
i
had
a
long
evening
with
the
scholar
and
two
both
old
men
who
had
been
pilots
taking
down
stories
and
poems
we
were
at
work
for
nearly
six
hours
and
the
more
matter
we
got
the
more
the
old
men
seemed
to
remember
was
to
go
out
fishing
tonight
said
the
younger
as
he
came
in
i
promised
you
to
come
and
you
a
civil
man
so
i
take
five
pounds
to
break
my
word
to
you
and
now
taking
up
his
glass
of
whisky
to
your
good
health
and
may
you
live
till
they
make
you
a
coffin
out
of
a
gooseberry
bush
or
till
you
die
in
childbed
they
drank
my
health
and
our
work
began
you
heard
tell
of
the
poet
macsweeny
said
the
same
man
sitting
down
near
me
have
i
said
the
town
of
galway
he
said
tell
you
his
piece
the
big
wedding
for
it
a
fine
piece
and
there
are
many
that
know
it
there
was
a
poor
servant
girl
out
in
the
country
and
she
got
married
to
a
poor
servant
boy
macsweeny
knew
the
two
of
them
and
he
was
away
at
that
time
and
it
was
a
month
before
he
came
back
when
he
came
back
he
went
to
see
peggy
that
was
the
name
of
the
girl
and
he
asked
her
if
they
had
had
a
great
wedding
peggy
said
it
was
only
middling
but
they
had
forgotten
him
all
the
same
and
she
had
a
bottle
of
whisky
for
him
in
the
cupboard
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
began
drinking
the
whisky
when
he
had
a
couple
of
glasses
taken
and
was
warm
by
the
fire
he
began
making
a
song
and
this
was
the
song
he
made
about
the
wedding
of
peggy
he
had
the
poem
both
in
english
and
irish
but
as
it
has
been
found
elsewhere
and
attributed
to
another
i
need
not
give
it
we
had
another
round
of
porter
and
whisky
and
then
the
old
man
who
had
macsweeny
wedding
gave
us
a
bit
of
a
drinking
song
which
the
scholar
took
down
and
i
translated
with
him
afterwards
is
what
the
old
woman
says
at
the
beulleaca
when
she
sees
a
man
without
knowledge
you
ever
at
the
house
of
the
still
did
you
ever
get
a
drink
from
it
neither
wine
nor
beer
is
as
sweet
as
it
is
but
it
is
well
i
was
not
burnt
when
i
fell
down
after
a
drink
of
it
by
the
fire
of
sloper
praise
owen
over
all
the
doctors
of
ireland
it
is
he
put
drugs
on
the
water
and
it
lying
on
the
barley
you
gave
but
a
drop
of
it
to
an
old
woman
who
does
be
walking
the
world
with
a
stick
she
would
think
for
a
week
that
it
was
a
fine
bed
was
made
for
her
after
that
i
had
to
get
out
my
fiddle
and
play
some
tunes
for
them
while
they
finished
their
whisky
a
new
stock
of
porter
was
brought
in
this
morning
to
the
little
underneath
my
room
and
i
could
hear
in
the
intervals
of
our
talk
that
a
number
of
men
had
come
in
to
treat
some
neighbors
from
the
middle
island
and
were
singing
many
songs
some
of
them
in
english
or
of
the
kind
i
have
given
but
most
of
them
in
irish
a
little
later
when
the
party
broke
up
downstairs
my
old
men
got
nervous
about
the
fairies
they
live
some
distance
away
and
set
off
across
the
sandhills
the
next
day
i
left
with
the
steamer
