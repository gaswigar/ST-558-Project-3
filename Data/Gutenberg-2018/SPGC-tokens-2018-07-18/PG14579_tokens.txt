simon
called
peter
by
robert
keable
author
of
the
drift
of
pinions
standing
by
etc
this
book
is
dedicated
to
julie
she
never
lived
maybe
but
it
is
truer
to
say
that
she
never
dies
nor
shall
she
ever
die
one
may
believe
in
god
though
he
is
hard
to
find
and
in
women
though
such
as
julie
are
far
to
seek
the
author
to
the
reader
the
glamour
of
no
other
evil
thing
is
stronger
than
the
glamour
of
war
it
would
seem
as
if
the
cup
of
the
world
sorrow
as
a
result
of
war
had
been
filled
to
the
brim
again
and
again
but
still
a
new
generation
has
always
been
found
to
forget
a
new
generation
has
always
been
found
to
talk
of
the
heroisms
that
the
divine
in
us
can
manifest
in
the
mouth
of
hell
and
to
forget
that
so
great
a
miracle
does
not
justify
our
creation
of
the
circumstance
yet
if
ever
war
came
near
to
its
final
condemnation
it
was
in
our
comrades
died
bravely
and
we
had
been
willing
to
die
to
put
an
end
to
it
once
and
for
all
indeed
men
heard
the
noise
of
conflict
die
away
on
november
thinking
that
that
end
had
been
attained
it
is
not
yet
three
years
ago
a
little
time
but
long
enough
for
betrayal
long
enough
too
for
the
making
of
many
books
about
it
all
wherein
has
been
recorded
such
heroisms
as
might
make
god
proud
and
such
horror
as
might
make
the
devil
weep
yet
has
the
truth
been
told
after
all
has
the
world
realized
that
in
a
modern
war
a
nation
but
moves
in
uniform
to
perform
its
ordinary
tasks
in
a
new
intoxicating
atmosphere
now
and
again
a
small
percentage
of
the
whole
is
flung
into
the
pit
and
for
them
where
one
in
ten
was
heavy
slaughter
now
one
in
ten
is
reasonable
escape
the
rest
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
live
an
unnatural
life
death
near
enough
to
make
them
reckless
and
far
enough
to
make
them
gay
commonly
men
and
women
more
or
less
restrain
themselves
because
of
but
what
if
there
be
no
what
if
the
dice
are
heavily
weighted
against
it
and
what
of
their
already
jeoparded
restraint
when
the
crisis
has
thrown
the
conventions
to
the
winds
and
there
is
little
to
lighten
the
end
of
the
day
thus
to
lift
the
veil
on
life
behind
the
lines
in
time
of
war
is
a
thankless
task
the
will
not
believe
and
particularly
they
whose
smug
respectability
and
conventional
religion
has
been
put
to
no
such
fiery
trial
moreover
they
will
do
more
than
disbelieve
they
will
say
that
the
story
is
not
fit
to
be
told
nor
is
it
but
then
it
should
never
have
been
lived
that
very
respectability
that
very
conventionality
that
very
contented
backboneless
religion
made
it
possible
all
but
made
it
necessary
for
it
was
those
things
which
allowed
the
world
to
drift
into
the
war
and
what
the
war
was
nine
days
out
of
ten
ought
to
be
thrust
under
the
eyes
of
those
who
will
not
believe
it
is
a
small
thing
that
men
die
in
battle
for
a
man
has
but
one
life
to
live
and
it
is
good
to
give
it
for
one
friends
but
it
is
such
an
evil
that
it
has
no
like
this
drifting
of
a
world
into
a
hell
to
which
men
souls
are
driven
like
red
maple
leaves
before
the
autumn
wind
the
pious
books
made
hell
stink
of
brimstone
and
painted
the
devil
hideous
but
satan
is
not
such
a
fool
champagne
and
martinis
do
not
taste
like
gregory
powder
nor
was
anthony
tempted
by
shrivelled
hags
paganism
can
be
gay
and
passion
look
like
love
moreover
still
more
truly
christ
could
see
the
potentiality
of
virtue
in
mary
magdalene
and
of
strength
in
simon
called
peter
the
conventional
religious
world
does
not
a
curious
feature
too
of
that
strange
life
was
its
lack
of
consecutiveness
it
was
like
the
pages
of
vie
the
friend
of
was
gone
for
ever
a
man
arrived
weary
and
dirty
and
craving
for
excitement
in
some
unknown
town
in
half
an
hour
he
had
stepped
into
the
gay
glitter
of
wine
and
women
smiles
in
half
a
dozen
he
had
been
whirled
away
the
days
lingered
and
yet
flew
the
pages
were
twirled
ever
more
dazzlingly
only
at
the
end
men
saw
in
a
blinding
flash
whither
they
had
been
led
these
things
then
are
set
out
in
this
book
this
is
its
atmosphere
they
are
truly
set
out
they
are
not
still
less
are
they
pictured
as
men
might
have
seen
them
in
more
sober
moments
as
the
puritan
world
would
see
them
now
nor
does
the
book
set
forth
the
author
judgment
for
that
is
not
his
idea
of
a
novel
it
sets
out
what
peter
and
julie
saw
and
did
and
what
it
appeared
to
them
to
be
while
they
did
it
very
probably
then
the
average
reader
had
better
read
no
further
than
this
but
at
any
rate
let
him
not
read
further
than
is
written
the
last
page
has
been
left
blank
it
has
been
left
blank
for
a
reason
because
the
curtain
falls
not
on
the
conclusion
of
the
lives
of
those
who
have
stepped
upon
the
boards
but
at
a
psychological
moment
in
their
story
the
lord
has
turned
to
look
upon
peter
and
julie
has
seen
that
he
has
looked
it
is
enough
they
were
happy
who
going
down
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
saw
a
vision
of
god
love
even
there
for
the
christ
of
calvary
moved
to
his
cross
again
but
a
few
short
years
ago
and
it
is
enough
in
one
book
to
tell
how
simon
failed
to
follow
but
how
jesus
turned
to
look
on
peter
part
i
ah
is
thy
love
indeed
a
weed
albeit
an
amaranthine
weed
suffering
no
flowers
except
its
own
to
mount
ah
must
designer
infinite
ah
must
thou
char
the
wood
ere
thou
canst
limn

francis

chapter
i
london
lay
as
if
washed
with
that
sunday
morning
light
blue
sky
and
pale
dancing
sunlight
wooing
the
begrimed
stones
of
westminster
like
a
young
girl
with
an
old
lover
the
empty
streets
were
bathed
in
the
light
and
appeared
to
be
transformed
from
the
streets
of
life
yet
the
half
of
londoners
lay
late
abed
perhaps
because
six
mornings
a
week
of
reality
made
them
care
little
for
one
of
magic
peter
nevertheless
saw
little
of
this
beauty
he
walked
swiftly
as
always
and
he
looked
about
him
but
he
noticed
none
of
these
things
true
a
fluttering
sheet
of
newspaper
headlines
impaled
on
the
railings
of
margaret
held
him
for
a
second
but
that
was
because
its
message
was
the
one
that
rang
continually
in
his
head
and
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
beauty
of
things
that
he
passed
by
he
was
a
perfectly
dressed
young
man
in
a
frock
coat
and
silk
hat
of
the
london
clergyman
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
preach
at
john
at
the
morning
service
walking
always
helped
him
to
prepare
his
sermons
and
this
sermon
would
ordinarily
have
struck
him
as
one
well
worth
preparing
the
pulpit
of
john
marked
a
rung
up
in
the
ladder
for
him
that
great
fashionable
church
of
faith
and
manners
held
a
congregation
on
sunday
mornings
for
which
the
rector
catered
with
care
it
said
a
good
deal
for
peter
that
he
had
been
invited
to
preach
he
ought
to
have
had
his
determined
scheme
plain
before
him
and
a
few
sentences
carefully
polished
at
hand
for
the
beginning
and
the
end
he
could
trust
himself
in
the
middle
and
was
perfectly
conscious
of
that
he
frankly
liked
preaching
liked
it
not
merely
as
an
actor
loves
to
sway
his
audience
but
liked
it
because
he
always
knew
what
to
say
and
was
really
keen
that
people
should
see
his
argument
and
yet
this
morning
when
he
should
have
been
prepared
for
the
best
he
could
do
he
was
not
prepared
at
all
strictly
that
is
not
quite
true
for
he
had
a
text
and
the
text
absolutely
focused
his
thought
but
it
was
too
big
for
him
like
some
at
least
in
england
that
day
he
was
conscious
of
staring
down
a
lane
of
tragedy
that
appalled
him
fragments
and
sentences
came
and
went
in
his
head
he
groped
for
words
mentally
as
he
walked
over
and
over
again
he
repeated
his
text
it
amazed
him
by
its
simplicity
it
horrified
him
by
its
depth
hilda
was
waiting
at
the
as
she
had
said
she
would
be
and
little
as
she
could
guess
it
she
irritated
him
he
did
not
want
her
just
then
he
could
hardly
tell
why
except
that
somehow
she
ran
counter
to
his
thoughts
altogether
that
morning
she
seemed
even
in
her
excellent
brown
costume
that
fitted
her
fine
figure
so
well
out
of
place
and
out
of
place
for
the
first
time
they
were
not
openly
engaged
these
two
but
there
was
an
understanding
between
them
and
an
understanding
that
her
family
was
slowly
recognising
lessing
at
first
would
never
have
accepted
an
engagement
for
he
had
other
ideas
for
his
daughter
of
the
big
house
in
park
lane
the
rich
city
merchant
at
john
important
in
his
party
and
a
person
of
distinction
when
at
his
club
would
have
been
seriously
annoyed
that
his
daughter
should
consider
a
marriage
with
a
curate
whose
gifts
had
not
yet
made
him
an
income
but
he
recognised
that
the
young
man
might
go
far
young
graham
he
would
say
yes
a
clever
young
fellow
with
quite
remarkable
gifts
sir
bishop
thinks
a
lot
of
him
i
believe
preaches
extraordinarily
well
the
rector
said
he
would
ask
him
to
john
one
morning
peter
graham
parish
ran
down
to
the
river
and
included
slums
in
which
some
of
the
ladies
of
john
whose
congregation
had
seen
to
it
that
in
their
immediate
neighbourhood
there
were
no
such
things
were
interested
so
the
two
had
met
she
had
found
him
admirable
and
likeable
he
found
her
highly
respectable
and
seemingly
unapproachable
from
which
cold
elements
much
more
may
come
than
one
might
suppose
at
any
rate
now
lessing
said
nothing
when
hilda
went
to
post
a
letter
in
london
on
sunday
morning
before
breakfast
she
would
have
mildly
remonstrated
if
the
girl
had
gone
to
meet
the
young
man
the
which
was
england
once
and
may
despite
the
kaiser
be
england
yet
once
more
i
was
nearly
going
she
declared
you
a
bit
late
i
know
he
replied
i
could
help
it
the
early
service
took
longer
than
usual
but
i
glad
to
see
you
before
breakfast
tell
me
what
does
your
father
think
of
it
all
the
girl
gave
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
oh
he
says
war
is
impossible
the
credit
system
makes
it
impossible
but
if
he
really
thinks
so
i
do
see
why
he
should
say
it
so
often
and
so
violently
oh
peter
what
do
you
think
the
young
man
unconsciously
quickened
his
pace
i
think
it
is
certain
he
said
we
must
come
in
i
should
say
more
likely
the
credit
system
makes
it
impossible
for
us
to
keep
out
i
mean
half
europe
ca
go
to
war
and
we
sit
still
not
in
these
days
and
if
it
comes
good
lord
hilda
do
you
know
what
it
means
i
ca
see
the
end
only
it
looks
to
me
like
being
a
fearful
smash
oh
we
shall
pull
through
but
nobody
seems
to
see
that
our
ordinary
life
will
come
down
like
a
pack
of
cards
and
what
will
the
poor
do
and
ca
you
see
the
masses
of
poor
souls
that
will
be
thrown
into
the
vortex
like
like
he
broke
off
i
ca
find
words
he
said
gesticulating
nervously
it
colossal
peter
you
going
to
preach
about
it
i
can
see
you
are
but
do
take
care
what
you
say
i
should
hate
father
to
be
upset
he
so
oh
i
know
i
think
he
hates
to
be
thrown
out
you
know
and
he
wo
think
all
that
possible
she
glanced
up
the
least
little
bit
that
she
had
to
anxiously
graham
smiled
i
know
lessing
he
said
but
hilda
he
to
be
moved
why
he
may
be
in
khaki
yet
oh
peter
do
be
silly
why
father
fifty
and
not
exactly
in
training
she
laughed
then
seriously
but
for
goodness
sake
say
such
things
for
my
sake
anyway
peter
regarded
her
gravely
and
held
open
the
gate
i
remember
he
said
but
more
unlikely
things
may
happen
than
that
they
went
up
the
path
together
and
hilda
slipped
a
key
into
the
door
as
it
opened
a
thought
seemed
to
strike
her
for
the
first
time
what
will
do
she
demanded
suddenly
lessing
was
just
going
into
the
and
peter
had
no
need
to
reply
graham
she
said
coming
forward
graciously
i
wondered
if
hilda
would
meet
you
she
wanted
to
post
a
letter
come
in
you
must
be
hungry
after
your
walk
a
manservant
held
the
door
open
and
they
all
went
in
that
magic
sun
shone
on
the
silver
of
the
and
lit
up
the
otherwise
heavy
room
lessing
swung
the
cover
of
a
silver
dish
and
the
eggs
slipped
in
to
boil
she
touched
a
button
on
the
table
and
sat
down
just
as
lessing
came
rather
ponderously
forward
with
a
folded
newspaper
in
his
hand
morning
graham
he
said
morning
hilda
been
out
eh
well
well
lovely
morning
out
makes
one
feel
ten
years
younger
but
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
graham
waving
the
paper
as
he
spoke
peter
just
caught
the
portentous
headline
germany
declares
war
on
russia
as
he
pulled
up
to
the
table
but
he
did
not
need
to
see
it
there
was
really
no
news
only
that
it
is
certain
i
think
sir
he
said
oh
certain
certain
said
lessing
seating
himself
the
telegrams
say
they
are
over
the
frontier
of
luxembourg
and
massing
against
france
grey
ca
stop
now
but
the
world
wo
stand
it
ca
stand
it
there
ca
be
a
long
war
probably
it
all
a
big
bluff
again
they
know
in
berlin
that
business
ca
stand
a
war
or
at
any
rate
a
long
war
and
we
need
come
in
in
the
city
yesterday
they
said
the
government
could
do
more
by
standing
out
we
not
pledged
anderson
told
me
asquith
said
so
distinctly
and
thank
god
the
fleet
ready
it
madness
madness
and
we
must
keep
our
heads
that
what
i
say
anyway
graham
cracked
an
egg
mechanically
his
sermon
was
coming
back
to
him
he
saw
a
congregation
of
lessings
and
more
clearly
than
ever
the
other
things
what
about
belgium
he
queried
surely
our
honour
is
engaged
there
lessing
pulled
up
his
napkin
visibly
perturbed
yes
but
what
can
we
do
he
demanded
what
is
the
good
of
flinging
a
handful
of
troops
overseas
even
if
we
can
it
incredible
english
troops
in
flanders
in
this
century
in
my
opinion
in
my
opinion
i
say
we
should
do
better
to
hold
ourselves
in
readiness
germany
would
never
really
dare
antagonise
us
they
know
what
it
involves
why
there
hundreds
of
millions
of
pounds
at
stake
grey
has
only
to
be
firm
and
things
must
come
right
must
absolutely
must
annie
said
this
morning
that
she
heard
everyone
in
the
streets
last
night
say
we
must
fight
father
put
in
hilda
pooh
exclaimed
the
city
personage
touched
now
on
the
raw
what
do
the
fools
know
about
it
i
suppose
the
will
scream
but
thank
god
this
country
has
not
quite
gone
to
the
dogs
yet
the
people
indeed
the
mass
of
the
country
is
solid
for
sense
and
business
and
trusts
the
government
of
course
the
tory
press
will
make
the
whole
question
a
party
lever
if
it
can
but
it
ca
what
are
we
going
to
be
pushed
into
war
by
a
mob
and
a
few
journalists
why
labour
even
will
be
dead
against
it
come
graham
you
ought
to
know
something
about
that
more
in
your
line
than
mine
do
you
think
so
you
really
ought
not
to
let
the
maids
talk
so
said
lessing
gently
peter
glanced
at
her
with
a
curiously
hopeless
feeling
and
looked
slowly
round
the
room
until
his
eyes
rested
on
lessing
portrait
over
the
mantelshelf
presented
by
the
congregation
of
john
on
some
occasion
two
years
before
from
the
portrait
he
turned
to
the
gentleman
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
speak
lessing
was
saying
something
to
the
man
probably
ordering
the
car
he
glanced
across
at
hilda
who
had
made
some
reply
to
her
mother
and
was
toying
with
a
spoon
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
look
more
handsome
and
he
could
not
find
the
word
thought
of
solid
and
then
smiled
at
the
thought
it
did
not
fit
in
with
the
sunlight
on
her
hair
well
well
said
lessing
we
ought
to
make
a
move
it
wo
do
for
either
of
us
to
be
late
mr
preacher
the
congregation
of
john
assembled
on
a
sunday
morning
as
befitted
its
importance
and
dignity
families
arrived
or
arrived
by
two
or
three
representatives
and
proceeded
with
due
solemnity
to
their
private
pews
no
one
of
course
exchanged
greetings
on
the
way
up
the
church
but
every
lady
became
aware
not
only
of
the
other
ladies
present
but
of
what
each
wore
a
sidesman
with
an
air
of
portentous
gravity
as
one
who
in
opening
doors
performed
an
office
more
on
behalf
of
the
deity
than
the
worshippers
was
usually
at
hand
to
usher
the
party
in
once
there
there
was
some
stir
of
orderly
bustle
kneelers
were
distributed
according
to
requirements
books
sorted
out
after
the
solemn
unlocking
of
the
little
box
that
contained
them
sticks
and
hats
safely
stowed
away
these
duties
performed
paterfamilias
cast
one
penetrating
glance
round
the
church
and
leaned
gracefully
forward
with
a
kind
of
circular
motion
having
suitably
addressed
almighty
god
it
is
to
be
supposed
he
would
lean
back
adjust
his
trousers
possibly
place
an
elbow
on
the
and
contemplate
with
a
fixed
and
determined
gaze
the
distant
altar
peter
of
course
wound
in
to
solemn
music
with
the
procession
of
choir
boys
and
men
and
accorded
the
honour
of
a
beadle
with
a
silver
mace
since
he
was
to
preach
was
finally
installed
in
a
suitably
cushioned
seat
within
the
he
knelt
to
pray
but
it
was
an
effort
to
formulate
anything
he
was
intensely
conscious
that
morning
that
a
meaning
hitherto
unfelt
and
unguessed
lay
behind
his
world
and
even
behind
all
this
pomp
and
ceremony
that
he
knew
so
well
rising
of
course
when
the
senior
curate
began
to
intone
the
opening
sentence
in
a
manner
which
one
felt
was
worthy
even
of
john
he
allowed
himself
to
study
his
surroundings
as
never
before
the
church
had
indeed
an
air
of
great
beauty
in
the
morning
sunlight
the
renaissance
galleries
and
woodwork
mellowed
by
time
were
dusted
by
that
soft
warm
glow
and
the
somewhat
sparse
congregation
in
its
magnificently
isolated
groups
was
humanised
by
it
too
the
stone
of
the
chancel
flecked
with
colour
had
a
quiet
dignity
and
even
the
altar
ecclesiastically
ludicrous
had
a
grace
of
its
own
there
was
to
be
a
celebration
after
matins
the
historic
gold
plate
was
therefore
arranged
on
the
retable
with
something
of
the
effect
of
show
pieces
at
mappin
and
webb
peter
noticed
three
flagons
and
between
them
two
patens
of
great
size
a
smaller
pair
for
use
stood
on
the
the
gold
chalice
and
paten
veiled
stood
on
the
itself
and
above
them
behind
rose
the
cross
and
two
vases
of
lilies
suggesting
one
of
the
great
shields
of
beaten
gold
that
king
solomon
had
made
for
the
temple
of
jerusalem
an
stood
on
edge
and
leant
against
the
retable
to
the
right
of
the
veiled
chalice
peter
found
himself
marvelling
at
its
size
but
was
recalled
to
his
position
when
it
became
necessary
to
kneel
for
the
confession
the
service
followed
its
accustomed
course
and
throughout
the
whole
of
it
peter
was
conscious
of
his
chaotic
sermon
he
glanced
at
his
notes
occasionally
and
then
put
them
resolutely
away
well
aware
that
they
would
be
all
but
useless
to
him
either
he
would
at
the
last
be
able
to
formulate
the
thoughts
that
raced
through
his
head
or
else
he
could
do
no
more
than
occupy
the
pulpit
for
the
conventional
twenty
minutes
with
a
conventional
sermon
at
times
he
half
thought
he
would
follow
this
easier
course
but
then
the
great
letters
of
the
newspaper
poster
seemed
to
frame
themselves
before
him
and
he
knew
he
could
not
and
so
at
last
there
was
the
bowing
beadle
with
the
silver
mace
and
he
must
set
out
on
the
little
dignified
procession
to
the
great
jacobean
pulpit
with
its
velvet
cushion
at
the
top
hilda
mind
was
a
curious
study
during
that
sermon
at
first
as
her
lover
rather
head
appeared
in
sight
she
had
studied
him
with
an
odd
mixture
of
pride
and
apprehension
she
held
her
but
she
did
not
need
it
and
she
watched
surreptitiously
while
he
opened
the
bible
arranged
some
papers
and
in
accordance
with
custom
knelt
to
pray
she
began
to
think
of
the
days
that
might
be
when
perhaps
she
would
be
the
wife
of
the
rector
of
some
john
and
later
possibly
of
a
bishop
peter
had
it
in
him
to
go
far
she
knew
she
half
glanced
round
with
a
feeling
that
people
might
be
guessing
at
her
thoughts
and
then
back
wondering
suddenly
if
she
really
knew
the
man
or
only
the
minister
and
then
there
came
the
rustle
of
shutting
books
and
of
people
composing
themselves
to
listen
the
few
coughs
the
vague
suggestion
of
hassocks
and
cushions
being
made
comfortable
and
then
in
a
moment
almost
with
the
giving
out
of
the
text
the
sudden
stillness
and
that
tense
sensation
which
told
that
the
young
orator
had
gripped
his
congregation
thereafter
she
hardly
heard
him
as
it
were
and
she
certainly
lost
the
feeling
of
ownership
that
had
been
hers
before
as
he
leaned
over
the
pulpit
and
the
words
rang
out
almost
harshly
from
their
intensity
she
began
to
see
as
the
rest
of
the
congregation
began
to
see
the
images
that
the
preacher
conjured
up
before
her
a
sense
of
coming
disaster
riveted
her
the
feeling
that
she
was
already
watching
the
end
of
an
age
jesus
had
compassion
on
the
multitude
that
had
been
the
short
and
simple
text
simple
words
the
preacher
had
said
but
how
when
one
realised
who
had
had
compassion
and
on
what
almighty
god
himself
with
his
incarnate
mind
set
on
the
working
out
of
immense
and
agelong
plans
had
as
it
were
paused
for
a
moment
to
have
compassion
on
hungry
women
and
crying
babies
and
folk
whose
petty
confused
affairs
could
have
seemed
of
no
consequence
to
anyone
in
the
drama
of
the
world
and
then
with
a
few
terse
sentences
the
preacher
swung
from
that
instance
to
the
world
drama
of
did
they
realise
he
asked
that
peaceful
bright
sunday
morning
that
millions
of
simple
men
were
at
that
moment
being
hurled
at
each
other
to
maim
and
kill
at
the
bidding
of
powers
that
even
they
could
hardly
visualise
at
the
behest
of
world
politics
that
not
one
in
a
thousand
would
understand
and
scarcely
any
justify
houses
were
being
broken
up
women
were
weeping
and
children
playing
in
the
sun
before
cottage
doors
were
even
now
being
left
fatherless
it
was
incredible
colossal
unimaginable
but
as
one
tried
to
picture
it
hell
had
opened
her
mouth
and
death
gone
forth
to
slay
it
was
terrible
enough
that
battlefields
of
stupendous
size
should
soon
be
littered
with
the
dying
and
the
dead
but
the
aftermath
of
such
a
war
as
this
would
be
still
more
terrible
no
one
could
say
how
near
it
would
come
to
them
all
no
one
could
tell
what
revolution
in
morals
and
social
order
such
a
war
as
this
might
not
bring
that
day
god
himself
looked
down
on
the
multitude
as
sheep
having
no
shepherd
abandoned
to
be
butchered
by
the
wolves
and
his
heart
beat
with
a
divine
compassion
for
the
infinite
sorrows
of
the
world
there
was
little
more
to
it
an
exhortation
to
go
home
to
fear
and
pray
and
set
the
house
in
order
against
the
day
of
wrath
and
that
was
all
my
brethren
said
the
young
man
and
the
intensity
of
his
thought
lent
a
certain
unusual
solemnity
to
the
conventional
title
no
one
can
tell
how
the
events
of
this
week
may
affect
us
our
feet
may
even
now
be
going
down
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
temptation
of
conflict
of
death
and
even
now
there
may
be
preparing
for
us
a
chalice
such
as
we
shall
fear
to
drink
let
us
pray
that
in
that
hour
the
compassion
of
jesus
may
be
real
to
us
and
we
ourselves
find
a
sure
place
in
that
sorrowful
heart
and
he
was
gone
from
the
pulpit
without
another
word
it
would
have
been
almost
ridiculous
if
one
had
noted
that
the
surprised
beadle
had
had
no
and
now
to
god
the
father
in
which
to
reach
the
pulpit
and
had
been
forced
to
meet
his
victim
hurrying
halfway
up
the
chancel
but
perhaps
no
one
but
that
dignitary
whom
the
fall
of
thrones
would
not
shake
had
noticed
it
the
congregation
paid
the
preacher
the
great
compliment
of
sitting
on
in
absolute
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
for
a
moment
it
still
stared
reality
in
the
face
and
then
lessing
shifted
in
his
pew
and
coughed
and
the
rector
rose
pompously
as
usual
to
announce
the
hymn
and
hilda
became
conscious
of
unaccustomed
tears
in
her
eyes
the
senior
curate
solemnly
uncovered
and
removed
the
chalice
taking
bread
and
wine
he
deposited
the
sacred
vessels
at
the
north
end
of
the
altar
returned
to
the
centre
unfolded
the
corporal
received
the
alms
and
as
solemnly
set
the
great
gold
dish
on
the
corporal
itself
after
the
unmeaning
custom
of
the
church
and
then
came
the
long
prayer
and
the
solemn
procession
to
the
vestry
while
a
dozen
or
two
stayed
with
the
senior
curate
for
the
communion
graham
found
himself
in
the
little
inner
vestry
with
its
table
and
massive
inkstand
and
registers
and
began
to
unvest
mechanically
he
got
his
coat
out
of
the
beautiful
carved
wardrobe
and
was
folding
up
his
hood
and
surplice
when
the
rector
laid
a
patronising
hand
on
his
shoulder
a
good
sermon
graham
he
said
a
good
sermon
if
a
little
emotional
it
was
a
pity
you
forgot
the
doxology
but
it
is
a
great
occasion
i
fear
a
greater
occasion
than
we
know
and
you
rose
to
it
very
well
last
night
i
had
half
a
mind
to
you
not
to
come
and
to
preach
myself
but
i
am
glad
now
i
did
not
i
am
sure
we
are
very
grateful
eh
sir
robert
sir
robert
doyle
the
other
warden
was
making
neat
piles
of
sovereigns
on
the
green
cloth
while
lessing
counted
the
silver
as
to
the
manner
born
he
was
a
pillar
of
the
church
too
was
sir
robert
but
a
soldier
and
a
straight
speaker
he
turned
genially
to
the
young
man
from
the
shoulder
rector
he
said
perhaps
it
will
make
a
few
of
us
sit
up
a
little
coming
down
to
church
i
met
arnold
of
the
war
office
and
he
said
war
was
certain
of
course
it
is
germany
has
been
playing
up
for
it
for
years
and
we
fools
have
been
blind
and
mad
but
it
come
now
thank
god
i
can
still
do
a
bit
and
maybe
we
shall
meet
out
there
yet
eh
mr
graham
somehow
or
another
that
aspect
of
the
question
had
not
struck
peter
forcibly
till
now
he
had
been
so
occupied
with
visualising
the
march
of
world
events
that
he
had
hardly
thought
of
himself
as
one
of
the
multitude
but
now
the
question
struck
home
what
would
he
do
he
was
at
a
loss
for
the
moment
the
rector
saved
him
however
well
well
of
course
sir
robert
apart
from
the
chaplains
the
place
of
the
clergy
will
be
almost
certainly
at
home
hospital
visiting
and
so
on
will
take
a
lot
of
time
i
believe
the
department
is
fully
staffed
but
doubtless
if
there
is
any
demand
the
clergy
will
respond
it
is
of
course
against
canon
law
for
them
to
fight
though
doubtless
our
young
friend
would
like
to
do
his
share
in
that
if
he
could
you
were
in
the
at
oxford
were
you
graham
yes
said
graham
shortly
the
french
priests
are
mobilising
with
the
nation
said
sir
robert
ah
yes
naturally
replied
the
rector
that
is
one
result
of
the
recent
legislation
thank
god
this
country
has
been
spared
that
and
in
any
case
we
shall
never
have
conscription
probably
the
army
will
have
to
be
enlarged
half
a
million
will
be
required
at
least
i
should
think
that
will
mean
more
chaplains
but
i
should
suppose
the
bishops
will
select
oh
yes
surely
their
lordships
will
select
it
would
be
a
pity
for
you
to
go
graham
it
rough
work
with
the
tommies
and
your
gifts
are
wanted
at
home
the
vicar
of
thomas
speaks
very
highly
of
your
gifts
as
an
organiser
and
doubtless
some
sphere
will
be
opened
up
for
you
well
well
these
are
stirring
times
mr
graham
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
young
man
lessing
carefully
smoothing
his
silk
hat
looked
up
come
in
to
luncheon
with
us
will
you
graham
he
said
peter
assented
and
shook
hands
all
round
sir
robert
and
he
moved
out
together
and
the
baronet
caught
his
eye
in
the
porch
this
jog
him
up
a
bit
i
thinking
he
said
to
himself
there
stuff
in
that
chap
but
he
got
to
feel
his
legs
outside
the
summer
sun
was
now
powerful
and
the
streets
were
dusty
and
more
busy
the
crowd
had
thinned
at
the
church
door
but
hilda
and
lessing
were
waiting
for
the
car
do
let
drive
said
hilda
as
they
came
up
i
much
sooner
walk
home
her
father
smiled
paternally
bit
cramped
after
church
eh
he
said
well
what
do
you
say
dear
he
asked
his
wife
i
think
i
shall
drive
lessing
replied
but
if
graham
is
coming
to
luncheon
perhaps
he
will
walk
round
with
hilda
will
you
mr
graham
with
pleasure
said
peter
i
agree
with
miss
lessing
and
the
walk
will
be
jolly
we
go
through
the
park
it
less
than
half
an
hour
is
it
it
was
arranged
at
that
and
the
elders
drove
off
peter
raised
his
hat
to
sir
robert
who
turned
up
the
street
and
together
he
and
hilda
crossed
over
the
wide
thoroughfare
and
started
down
for
the
park
there
was
silence
for
a
little
and
it
was
peter
who
broke
it
just
before
breakfast
he
said
you
asked
me
what
i
should
do
and
i
had
no
chance
to
reply
well
they
were
talking
of
it
in
the
vestry
just
now
and
i
made
up
my
mind
i
shall
write
to
the
bishop
and
ask
for
a
chaplaincy
they
walked
on
a
hundred
yards
or
so
in
silence
again
then
hilda
broke
it
peter
she
began
and
stopped
he
glanced
at
her
quickly
and
saw
in
a
minute
that
the
one
word
had
spoken
truly
to
him
oh
hilda
he
said
do
you
really
care
all
that
you
ca
possibly
oh
if
we
were
not
here
and
i
could
tell
you
all
i
feel
but
dear
i
love
you
i
know
now
that
i
have
loved
you
for
months
and
it
is
just
because
i
love
you
that
i
must
go
peter
began
hilda
again
and
again
stopped
then
she
took
a
grip
of
herself
and
spoke
out
bravely
oh
peter
she
said
you
guessed
right
i
never
meant
you
to
at
least
not
yet
but
it
is
terrible
to
think
of
you
going
out
there
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
glad
and
proud
and
in
a
way
i
am
but
you
do
seem
the
right
person
for
it
it
wasting
you
and
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
without
you
you
become
the
centre
of
my
life
i
count
on
seeing
you
and
on
working
with
you
if
you
go
you
you
may
oh
i
ca
say
it
i
ought
not
to
say
all
this
but
she
broke
off
abruptly
graham
glanced
round
him
they
were
in
the
park
now
and
no
one
in
particular
was
about
in
the
quiet
of
the
sidewalk
he
put
his
hand
out
and
drew
her
gently
to
a
seat
then
leaning
forward
and
poking
at
the
ground
with
his
stick
he
began
hilda
darling
he
said
it
awful
to
have
to
speak
to
you
just
now
and
just
like
this
but
i
must
first
about
ourselves
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
only
that
so
little
to
say
i
love
you
so
much
that
you
fill
my
life
and
i
have
planned
my
life
with
you
i
hardly
knew
it
but
i
had
i
thought
i
should
just
go
on
and
get
a
living
and
marry
you
perhaps
if
you
would
i
can
hardly
speak
of
it
now
i
know
you
would
and
and
oh
i
do
know
make
a
name
in
the
church
i
suppose
well
and
i
hope
we
shall
one
day
but
now
this
has
come
along
i
really
feel
all
i
said
this
morning
awfully
i
shall
go
out
i
must
the
men
must
be
helped
one
ca
sit
still
and
imagine
them
dying
wounded
tempted
and
without
a
priest
it
a
supreme
chance
we
shall
be
fighting
for
honour
and
truth
and
the
church
must
be
there
to
bear
her
witness
and
speak
her
message
there
will
be
no
end
to
do
and
it
is
a
chance
of
a
lifetime
to
get
into
touch
with
the
men
and
understand
them
you
do
see
that
do
you
and
besides
forgive
me
but
i
must
put
it
so
if
had
compassion
on
the
multitude
ought
we
not
to
have
too
showed
it
by
death
ought
we
to
fear
even
that
too
the
girl
stole
out
a
hand
and
his
gripped
it
hard
then
she
remembered
the
conventions
and
pulled
it
away
and
sat
a
little
more
upright
she
was
extraordinarily
conscious
of
herself
and
she
felt
as
if
she
had
two
selves
that
day
one
was
hilda
lessing
a
girl
she
knew
quite
well
a
person
who
understood
life
and
the
business
of
society
and
of
getting
married
quite
correctly
and
the
other
was
somebody
she
did
not
know
at
all
that
could
not
reason
and
who
felt
naked
and
ashamed
it
was
inexplicable
but
it
was
so
that
second
self
was
listening
to
heroics
and
even
talking
them
and
surely
heroics
were
a
little
out
of
date
she
looked
across
a
wide
green
space
and
saw
through
the
distant
trees
the
procession
of
the
church
parade
she
felt
as
if
she
ought
to
be
there
and
half
unconsciously
glanced
at
her
dress
a
couple
of
terriers
ran
scurrying
across
the
grass
and
a
man
came
round
the
corner
behind
them
a
taxi
hooted
and
some
sparrows
broke
out
into
a
noisy
chatter
in
a
bush
and
here
was
peter
talking
of
death
and
the
cross
and
out
of
church
too
she
gave
a
little
shudder
and
glanced
at
a
peter
she
said
we
must
go
dear
for
my
sake
do
think
it
over
wait
a
little
and
see
what
happens
i
quite
understand
your
point
of
view
but
you
must
think
of
others
even
your
vicar
my
parents
and
of
me
and
peter
shall
we
say
anything
about
our
our
love
what
do
you
think
peter
graham
looked
at
her
steadily
and
as
she
spoke
he
too
felt
the
contrast
between
his
thoughts
and
ordinary
life
the
london
curate
was
himself
again
he
got
up
well
darling
he
said
just
as
you
like
but
perhaps
not
at
any
rate
until
i
know
what
i
have
to
do
i
think
that
over
only
we
sha
change
shall
we
whatever
happens
you
love
me
do
you
and
i
do
love
you
hilda
met
his
gaze
frankly
and
blushed
a
little
she
held
out
a
hand
to
be
helped
up
my
dear
boy
she
said
after
luncheon
peter
smoked
a
cigar
in
the
study
with
lessing
before
departure
every
detail
of
that
hour
impressed
itself
upon
him
as
had
the
events
of
the
day
for
his
mind
was
strung
up
to
see
the
inner
meaning
of
things
clearly
they
began
with
the
usual
ritual
of
the
selection
of
chairs
and
cigars
and
lessing
had
a
glass
of
port
with
his
coffee
because
as
he
explained
his
nerves
were
all
on
edge
comfortably
stretched
out
in
an
armchair
blowing
smoke
thoughtfully
towards
the
empty
grate
his
fat
face
and
body
did
not
seem
capable
of
nerves
still
less
to
be
suffering
from
them
but
then
one
can
never
tell
from
appearances
at
any
rate
he
chose
his
words
with
care
and
graham
opposite
but
sitting
rather
upright
could
not
but
sense
his
meaning
well
well
well
he
said
to
think
we
should
come
to
this
a
european
war
in
this
century
and
we
in
it
not
that
i
believe
it
till
i
hear
it
officially
while
there
life
there
hope
eh
graham
peter
nodded
for
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
the
question
is
went
on
the
other
that
if
we
are
carried
into
war
what
is
the
best
policy
some
fools
will
lose
their
heads
of
course
and
chuck
everything
to
run
into
it
but
i
no
use
for
fools
graham
no
sir
said
peter
no
use
for
fools
repeated
lessing
i
shall
carry
on
with
business
as
usual
and
i
hope
other
people
will
carry
on
with
theirs
there
are
plenty
of
men
who
can
fight
and
who
ought
to
without
disorganising
everything
hilda
would
see
that
too
she
such
a
sensible
girl
look
at
that
boer
affair
and
all
that
foolery
about
the
why
i
met
a
south
african
at
the
club
the
other
day
who
said
we
have
done
ten
times
as
well
without
you
must
have
trained
men
these
days
and
after
all
it
the
men
behind
the
armies
that
win
the
war
men
like
you
and
i
graham
each
doing
his
ordinary
job
without
excitement
that
the
type
that
made
old
england
you
ought
to
preach
about
it
graham
come
to
think
it
fits
in
with
what
you
said
this
morning
and
a
good
sermon
too
young
man
every
man
got
to
put
his
house
in
order
and
carry
on
you
meant
that
did
you
something
like
that
said
peter
but
as
far
as
the
clergy
are
concerned
i
still
think
the
bishops
ought
to
pick
their
men
yes
yes
of
course
said
lessing
stretching
himself
a
bit
but
i
do
think
the
clergy
could
be
much
use
over
there
as
the
canon
said
there
will
be
plenty
to
do
at
home
in
any
case
it
would
be
no
use
rushing
the
bishops
let
them
see
what
needed
and
then
let
them
choose
their
men
eh
a
man
like
london
sure
to
be
in
the
know
good
thing
he
your
bishop
graham
you
can
leave
it
to
him
easily
i
should
think
so
sir
said
peter
forlornly
oh
well
glad
to
hear
you
say
it
i
sure
graham
and
so
will
lessing
be
and
hilda
we
folk
you
know
well
well
and
i
suppose
i
ought
to
keep
you
i
come
with
you
to
the
door
my
boy
he
walked
ahead
of
the
young
man
into
the
hall
and
handed
him
his
hat
himself
on
the
steps
they
shook
hands
to
the
fire
of
small
sentences
drop
in
some
evening
wo
you
do
know
if
i
really
congratulated
you
on
the
sermon
you
spoke
extraordinarily
well
graham
you
a
great
gift
after
all
this
war
will
give
you
a
bit
of
a
chance
eh
we
must
hear
you
again
in
john
lessing
said
graham
and
thank
you
for
all
said
in
the
street
he
walked
slowly
and
he
thought
of
all
lessing
had
not
said
as
well
as
all
he
had
after
all
he
had
spoken
sound
sense
and
there
was
hilda
he
could
lose
hilda
and
if
the
old
man
turned
out
obstinate
well
it
would
be
all
but
impossible
to
get
her
probably
things
were
not
as
bad
as
he
had
imagined
very
likely
it
would
all
be
over
by
christmas
if
so
it
was
not
much
use
throwing
everything
up
perhaps
he
could
word
the
letter
to
the
bishop
a
little
differently
he
turned
over
phrases
all
the
way
home
and
got
them
fairly
pat
but
it
was
a
busy
evening
and
he
did
not
write
that
night
monday
always
began
as
a
full
day
what
with
staff
meeting
and
so
on
and
its
being
bank
holiday
did
not
make
much
difference
to
them
but
in
the
afternoon
he
was
free
to
read
carefully
the
sunday
papers
and
was
appalled
with
the
swiftness
of
the
approach
of
the
universal
cataclysm
after
evensong
and
supper
then
he
got
out
paper
and
pen
and
wrote
though
it
took
much
longer
than
he
thought
it
would
in
the
end
he
begged
the
bishop
to
remember
him
if
it
was
really
necessary
to
find
more
chaplains
and
expressed
his
readiness
to
serve
the
church
and
the
country
when
he
was
wanted
when
it
was
written
he
sat
long
over
the
closed
envelope
and
smoked
a
couple
of
pipes
he
wondered
if
men
were
killing
each
other
even
now
just
over
the
water
he
pictured
a
battle
scene
drawing
from
imagination
and
what
he
remembered
of
at
aldershot
he
shuddered
a
little
as
he
conceived
himself
crawling
through
heather
to
reach
a
man
in
the
front
line
who
had
been
hit
while
the
enemies
guns
on
the
crest
opposite
were
firing
as
he
had
seen
them
fire
in
play
he
tried
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
hit
then
he
got
up
and
stretched
himself
he
looked
round
curiously
at
the
bookcase
the
oxford
group
or
two
the
hockey
cap
that
hung
on
the
edge
of
one
he
turned
to
the
mantelpiece
and
glanced
over
the
photos
probably
bob
scarlett
would
be
out
at
once
he
was
in
some
irish
regiment
or
other
old
howson
was
in
india
he
would
hear
or
see
much
jimmy
what
would
jimmy
do
now
he
picked
up
the
photograph
and
looked
at
it
the
thoughtful
face
of
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
who
had
got
his
fellowship
almost
at
once
after
his
brilliant
degree
and
was
just
now
he
reflected
on
holiday
in
the
south
of
france
jimmy
the
idealist
what
would
jimmy
do
he
reached
for
a
hat
and
made
for
the
door
he
would
post
his
letter
that
night
under
the
stars
once
outside
he
walked
on
farther
down
westminster
way
at
the
bridge
he
leaned
for
a
while
and
watched
the
sullen
tireless
river
and
then
turned
to
walk
up
past
the
house
it
was
a
clear
still
night
and
the
street
was
fairly
empty
big
ben
boomed
eleven
and
as
he
crossed
in
front
of
the
gates
to
reach
margaret
he
wondered
what
was
doing
in
there
he
had
the
vaguest
notion
where
people
like
the
prime
minister
and
sir
edward
grey
would
be
that
night
he
thought
possibly
with
the
king
or
in
downing
street
and
then
he
heard
his
name
being
called
and
turned
to
see
sir
robert
doyle
coming
towards
him
the
other
face
arrested
him
is
there
any
news
sir
robert
he
asked
sir
robert
glanced
up
in
his
turn
at
the
great
shining
dial
above
them
our
ultimatum
has
gone
or
is
just
going
to
germany
and
in
hours
we
shall
be
at
war
he
said
tersely
i
just
going
home
been
promised
a
job
chapter
ii
at
on
a
foggy
february
morning
victoria
station
looked
a
place
of
mystery
within
which
a
mighty
work
was
going
forward
electric
lights
still
shone
in
the
gloom
and
whereas
innumerable
units
of
life
ran
this
way
and
that
like
ants
disturbed
an
equal
number
stood
about
apparently
indifferent
and
unperturbed
tommies
who
had
found
a
place
against
a
wall
or
seat
deposited
rifle
and
pack
close
by
lit
a
pipe
and
let
the
world
go
by
content
that
when
the
officers
leave
train
had
gone
someone
or
some
providence
would
round
them
up
as
well
but
for
the
rest
porters
male
and
female
rushed
up
with
baggage
trunks
were
pushed
through
the
crowd
with
the
usual
objurgations
subalterns
mostly
loud
and
merry
greeted
each
other
or
the
officials
or
more
subdued
moved
purposefully
through
the
crowd
with
their
intent
on
finding
a
quieter
place
farther
up
the
platforms
there
was
no
mistaking
the
leave
platform
or
the
time
of
the
train
for
a
great
notice
drew
one
attention
to
it
once
there
the
army
took
a
man
in
hand
peter
was
entirely
new
to
the
process
but
he
speedily
discovered
that
his
fear
of
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
where
to
go
which
had
induced
him
among
other
reasons
to
say
at
home
and
come
alone
to
the
station
was
unfounded
passed
him
on
respectfully
but
purposefully
to
officials
who
looked
at
this
paper
and
that
and
finally
sent
him
up
to
an
officer
who
sat
at
a
little
table
with
papers
before
him
to
write
down
the
name
rank
unit
and
destination
of
each
individual
destined
that
very
morning
to
leave
for
the
army
in
france
peter
at
last
then
was
free
to
walk
up
the
platform
and
seek
the
rest
of
his
luggage
that
had
come
on
from
the
hotel
with
the
porter
he
was
free
that
is
if
one
disregarded
the
kit
hung
about
his
person
or
which
despite
king
regulations
he
carried
in
his
hands
but
free
or
not
he
could
not
find
his
luggage
at
it
struck
him
that
at
least
he
had
better
find
his
seat
he
therefore
entered
a
corridor
and
began
pilgrimage
it
was
seemingly
hopeless
the
seats
were
filled
with
coats
or
sticks
or
papers
every
type
of
officer
was
engaged
in
bestowing
himself
and
his
goods
and
the
general
atmosphere
struck
him
as
being
precisely
that
which
one
experiences
as
a
fresher
when
one
first
enters
hall
for
dinner
at
the
the
comparison
was
very
close
men
that
is
to
say
junior
officers
returning
from
their
first
leave
were
the
most
encumbered
and
asserting
those
of
the
second
year
so
to
say
usually
got
a
and
looked
out
of
window
while
here
and
there
a
senior
officer
or
a
subaltern
with
a
senior
face
selected
a
place
arranged
his
few
possessions
and
got
out
a
paper
not
in
the
oxford
manner
as
if
he
owned
the
place
but
in
the
cambridge
as
if
he
did
care
a
damn
who
did
peter
made
a
horrible
hash
of
it
he
tried
to
find
a
seat
with
all
his
goods
in
his
hands
not
realising
that
they
might
have
been
deposited
anywhere
in
the
train
and
found
when
it
had
started
since
owing
to
a
particular
dispensation
of
the
high
gods
everything
that
passed
the
barrier
for
france
got
there
he
made
a
dive
for
one
place
and
sat
in
it
never
noting
a
thin
stick
in
the
corner
and
he
cleared
out
with
enormous
apologies
when
a
perfectly
groomed
major
with
an
exceedingly
pleasant
manner
mentioned
that
it
was
his
seat
and
carefully
put
the
stick
elsewhere
as
soon
as
peter
had
gone
finally
at
the
end
of
a
carriage
he
descried
a
small
door
half
open
and
inside
what
looked
like
an
empty
seat
he
pulled
it
open
and
discovered
a
small
select
compartment
with
a
centre
table
and
three
men
about
it
all
making
themselves
very
comfortable
i
beg
your
pardon
said
peter
but
is
there
a
place
vacant
for
one
the
three
eyed
him
stonily
and
he
knew
instinctively
that
he
was
again
a
fresher
calling
on
the
second
year
one
a
captain
raised
his
head
to
look
at
him
better
he
was
a
man
of
light
hair
and
blue
alert
eyes
wearing
a
cap
that
while
not
looking
dissipated
somehow
conveyed
the
impression
that
its
owner
knew
all
about
things
a
cap
too
that
carried
the
springbok
device
the
lean
face
with
its
humorous
mouth
regarded
peter
and
took
him
all
in
his
vast
expanse
of
collar
the
wide
black
edging
to
his
his
badges
his
black
buttons
and
stars
then
he
lied
remorselessly
sorry
padre
we
full
up
peter
backed
out
and
forgot
to
close
the
door
for
at
that
moment
a
shrill
whistle
was
excruciatingly
blown
he
found
himself
in
the
very
cab
of
the
pullman
with
the
glass
door
before
him
through
which
could
be
seen
a
sudden
bustle
subalterns
hastened
forward
from
the
more
or
less
secluded
spots
that
they
had
found
with
a
vision
of
skirts
and
hats
behind
them
an
inspector
passed
aggressively
along
and
thanks
to
those
high
gods
peter
observed
the
hurrying
hotel
porter
at
that
moment
in
sixty
seconds
the
door
had
been
jerked
open
a
gladstone
a
and
a
shot
at
him
largesse
had
changed
hands
the
door
had
shut
again
the
train
had
groaned
and
started
and
peter
was
off
to
france
it
was
with
mixed
feelings
that
he
groped
for
his
luggage
he
was
conscious
of
wanting
a
seat
and
a
breakfast
he
was
also
conscious
of
wanting
to
look
at
the
station
he
was
leaving
which
he
dimly
felt
he
might
never
see
again
and
he
was
above
all
conscious
that
he
looked
a
fool
and
would
like
not
to
in
such
a
turmoil
he
lugged
at
the
gladstone
and
got
it
into
a
corner
and
then
turned
to
the
window
in
the
cleared
space
with
a
determination
in
turning
he
caught
the
captain
face
stuck
round
the
little
door
it
was
withdrawn
at
once
but
came
out
again
and
he
heard
for
the
second
time
the
unfamiliar
title
say
padre
come
in
here
there
room
after
all
peter
felt
cheered
he
staggered
to
the
door
and
found
the
others
busy
making
room
a
subaltern
of
the
gripped
his
small
attaché
case
and
swung
it
up
on
to
the
rack
the
south
african
pulled
a
british
warm
off
the
vacant
seat
and
reached
out
for
the
and
the
third
man
with
the
rank
of
a
major
and
the
badge
of
a
bursting
bomb
struck
a
match
and
paused
as
he
lit
a
cigarette
to
jerk
out
damned
full
train
we
ought
to
have
missed
it
donovan
it
a
good
stunt
that
if
too
many
blighters
do
try
it
on
observed
the
subaltern
reaching
for
peter
warm
but
they
did
my
last
leave
and
i
got
the
devil
of
a
choking
off
from
the
in
charge
the
staff
train
and
they
only
take
prime
ministers
journalists
and
officials
in
addition
how
that
padre
thanks
said
peter
subsiding
it
jolly
good
of
you
to
take
me
in
i
thought
i
got
to
stand
from
here
to
folkestone
jenks
regarded
him
seriously
it
could
be
done
padre
he
said
not
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
i
left
ealing
about
midnight
more
or
less
got
sandwiched
in
the
metro
with
a
and
his
blooming
wife
and
daughters
and
had
to
wait
god
knows
how
long
for
the
if
i
could
get
a
seat
and
a
break
after
that
i
be
a
casualty
sure
thing
it
your
own
fault
for
going
home
last
night
observed
the
major
judiciously
peter
noticed
that
he
was
little
older
than
jenks
on
inspection
gad
donovan
you
should
have
been
with
us
at
the
adelphi
it
was
some
do
i
can
tell
you
and
afterwards
shut
up
major
cut
in
jenks
remember
the
padre
oh
he
i
know
are
you
padre
by
the
way
did
you
ever
meet
old
drennan
who
was
up
near
poperinghe
with
the
canadians
he
was
a
sport
i
can
tell
you
mind
you
a
real
good
chap
at
his
job
but
a
white
man
pluck
by
jove
i
do
think
that
chap
had
nerves
i
saw
him
one
day
when
they
were
dropping
heavy
stuff
on
the
station
and
he
was
getting
some
casualties
out
of
a
red
cross
train
a
shell
burst
just
down
the
embankment
and
his
two
orderlies
ducked
for
it
under
the
carriage
but
old
drennan
never
turned
a
hair
have
a
fag
he
said
to
the
scottie
he
was
helping
no
use
letting
fritz
put
one
off
smoke
peter
said
he
had
not
met
him
but
could
not
think
of
anything
else
to
say
at
the
moment
except
that
he
was
just
going
out
for
the
first
time
you
do
say
said
donovan
dryly
wish
i
was
ejaculated
jenks
good
chap
replied
the
major
pity
more
of
your
sort
do
come
over
when
i
was
up
at
loos
september
last
year
we
did
see
a
padre
in
three
months
then
they
put
on
a
little
chap
forget
his
name
who
used
to
bike
over
when
we
were
in
rest
billets
but
he
was
much
use
i
was
in
hospital
seven
weeks
and
never
saw
one
said
jenks
good
heavens
said
graham
but
i
been
trying
to
get
out
for
all
these
years
and
i
was
always
told
that
every
billet
was
taken
and
that
there
were
hundreds
on
the
waiting
list
last
december
the
himself
showed
me
a
list
of
over
two
hundred
names
do
know
where
they
get
to
then
do
you
bevan
asked
jenks
no
said
the
major
unless
they
keep
at
the
base
plenty
down
at
rouen
anyway
said
donovan
a
sporting
little
blighter
i
met
at
the
brasserie
opera
told
me
he
had
anything
to
do
anyway
i
shall
be
a
padre
in
the
next
war
said
jenks
stretching
out
his
legs
a
parade
on
sunday
and
you
finished
for
the
week
no
orderly
dog
no
night
work
and
plenty
of
time
for
your
meals
padres
can
always
get
leave
too
and
they
always
come
and
go
by
paris
donovan
laughed
and
glanced
sideways
at
peter
stow
it
jenks
he
said
where
you
for
padre
he
asked
i
got
to
report
at
rouen
said
peter
i
was
wondering
if
you
were
there
no
such
luck
now
returned
the
other
but
it
a
jolly
place
there
get
him
to
take
you
out
to
duclair
you
can
get
roast
duck
at
a
pub
there
that
melts
in
your
mouth
and
what
that
little
hotel
near
the
statue
of
joan
of
arc
jenks
where
they
still
have
decent
wine
peter
was
not
to
learn
yet
awhile
for
at
that
moment
the
little
door
opened
and
a
waiter
looked
in
breakfast
gentlemen
he
asked
oh
no
said
jenks
waiter
i
always
bring
some
rations
with
me
just
take
a
cup
of
coffee
the
man
grinned
sir
he
said
porridge
gentlemen
he
disappeared
leaving
the
door
open
and
donovan
opening
a
newspaper
graham
stared
out
of
window
to
wait
from
the
far
corners
came
scraps
of
conversation
from
which
he
gathered
that
jenks
and
the
major
were
going
over
the
doings
of
the
night
before
he
caught
a
word
or
two
and
stared
the
harder
out
of
window
outside
the
english
country
was
rushing
by
little
villas
with
running
down
to
the
rail
would
give
way
for
a
mile
or
two
to
fields
and
then
start
afresh
the
fog
was
thin
there
and
england
looked
extraordinarily
homely
and
pleasant
it
was
the
known
he
was
conscious
of
rushing
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
into
the
unknown
he
turned
over
the
scrappy
conversation
of
the
last
few
minutes
and
found
it
savoured
of
the
unknown
it
was
curious
the
difference
uniform
made
he
felt
that
these
men
were
treating
him
more
like
one
of
themselves
than
men
in
a
had
ever
treated
him
before
that
somehow
even
his
badges
made
him
welcome
and
yet
that
nevertheless
it
was
not
he
peter
graham
that
they
welcomed
or
at
least
not
his
type
he
wondered
if
padres
in
france
were
different
from
priests
in
england
he
turned
over
the
unknown
drennan
in
his
mind
was
it
because
he
was
a
good
priest
that
the
men
liked
him
or
because
they
had
discovered
the
man
in
the
parson
the
waiter
brought
in
the
breakfast
porridge
fish
toast
and
the
rest
and
they
fell
to
a
running
fire
of
comments
going
on
all
the
time
donovan
had
had
japanese
marmalade
somewhere
and
thought
it
better
than
this
the
major
would
touch
the
beastly
margarine
but
jenks
thought
it
quite
as
good
as
butter
if
taken
with
marmalade
and
put
it
on
nearly
as
thickly
as
his
toast
peter
expanded
in
the
air
of
camaraderie
and
when
he
leaned
back
with
a
cigarette
tunic
unbuttoned
and
cap
tossed
up
on
the
rack
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
army
for
years
he
reflected
how
curious
that
was
the
last
two
or
three
years
or
so
of
boy
scouts
and
hospitals
and
extra
attended
by
the
people
who
attended
everything
else
seemed
to
have
faded
away
there
was
hardly
a
gap
between
that
first
war
evening
which
he
remembered
so
clearly
and
this
it
was
a
common
experience
enough
and
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
whereas
everything
else
had
made
little
impression
he
had
lived
for
this
moment
and
been
extraordinarily
impressed
by
that
sunday
but
he
realised
also
that
it
was
due
as
much
to
his
present
companions
they
had
seemingly
accepted
him
as
he
had
never
been
accepted
before
they
asked
practically
no
questions
so
far
as
he
could
see
he
made
no
difference
to
them
he
felt
as
if
he
were
at
last
part
of
a
great
brotherhood
in
which
chiefly
one
worried
about
nothing
more
important
than
japanese
marmalade
and
margarine
we
almost
there
boys
said
bevan
peering
out
of
window
curse
ejaculated
jenks
i
hate
getting
my
traps
together
in
a
train
and
i
loathe
the
mob
on
the
boat
i
do
see
why
you
should
said
donovan
i
blest
if
i
bother
about
anything
the
and
the
do
everything
and
you
need
even
worry
about
getting
a
pullman
ticket
this
way
over
hope
it
not
rough
though
he
let
a
window
down
and
leaned
out
looks
all
right
he
added
peter
got
up
with
the
rest
and
began
to
hang
things
about
him
his
staringly
new
sam
browne
irritated
him
but
he
forgot
it
as
the
train
swung
round
the
curve
to
the
get
a
porter
and
a
truck
donovan
said
the
major
who
was
farthest
from
the
door
they
got
out
nonchalantly
and
peter
lit
a
cigarette
while
the
others
threw
remarks
at
the
man
as
to
luggage
then
they
all
trooped
off
together
in
a
crowd
that
consisted
of
every
variety
of
rank
and
regiment
and
section
of
the
british
empire
plus
some
waacs
and
nurses
pride
of
lay
alongside
and
when
they
got
there
she
seemed
already
full
the
four
of
them
got
jammed
at
the
gangway
and
shoved
on
board
handing
in
and
receiving
papers
from
the
official
at
the
head
as
they
passed
him
donovan
was
in
front
and
as
he
stepped
on
deck
he
swung
his
back
to
peter
crying
lay
hold
of
that
padre
and
edge
across
the
deck
get
up
ahead
of
the
funnel
that
side
i
get
chairs
jenko
you
rotter
get
belts
and
drop
eyeing
the
girl
jolly
nice
bit
of
fluff
said
jenks
meditatively
staring
fixedly
across
the
deck
where
queried
the
major
fumbling
for
his
eyeglass
get
on
there
please
gentlemen
called
a
ship
official
damn
it
mind
my
leg
cheerio
old
son
here
we
are
again
i
say
tommy
did
you
get
to
the
alhambra
last
night
after
all
what
well
i
could
see
you
anyhow
to
which
accompaniment
peter
pushed
his
way
across
the
deck
sorry
padre
said
a
who
blocked
the
way
bending
herself
back
to
let
him
pass
and
smiling
catch
hold
called
out
donovan
swinging
a
couple
of
chairs
at
him
no
sir
it
not
my
chair
to
a
colonel
who
was
grabbing
at
one
already
set
out
against
the
rail
the
colonel
collected
it
and
disappeared
jenks
appearing
a
moment
later
through
the
crush
you
blamed
fool
he
whispered
it
that
girl
i
saw
her
put
one
here
and
edged
up
on
it
only
some
fool
got
in
my
way
still
hopefully
perhaps
she
come
back
between
them
they
got
four
chairs
into
a
line
and
sat
down
all
that
is
save
jenks
who
stood
up
in
a
bland
and
genial
way
as
if
to
survey
the
crowd
impartially
how
impartially
soon
appeared
damn
he
exploded
she
met
some
other
females
weird
and
woolly
things
and
she
sitting
down
there
no
by
jove
she
looking
this
way
he
made
a
forward
and
the
major
kicked
his
shins
blast
he
exploded
why
did
you
do
that
you
fool
do
be
an
infant
jenko
sit
down
you
ca
start
a
flirtation
across
the
blooming
deck
here
padre
ca
you
keep
him
in
order
peter
half
raised
himself
from
his
chair
at
this
and
glanced
the
way
the
other
was
looking
through
the
crush
he
saw
clearly
enough
for
a
minute
a
girl
of
medium
height
in
a
nurse
uniform
sideways
on
to
him
the
next
second
she
obviously
smiling
some
remark
to
her
neighbour
and
he
caught
sight
of
clear
brown
eyes
and
a
little
fringe
of
dark
hair
on
the
forehead
of
an
almost
childish
face
the
eyes
met
his
and
then
a
sailor
blundered
across
his
field
of
vision
topping
is
she
demanded
jenks
who
had
apparently
been
pulled
down
into
his
chair
in
the
interval
oh
i
do
know
said
graham
and
added
deliberately
rather
ordinary
i
thought
jenks
stared
at
him
good
lord
padre
he
said
where
are
your
eyes
peter
heard
a
little
chuckle
behind
and
glanced
round
to
see
donovan
staring
at
him
with
amusement
written
all
across
his
face
you
do
padre
he
said
taking
a
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
beginning
to
fill
it
peter
smiled
and
leant
back
probably
for
the
first
time
in
five
years
he
forgot
for
a
moment
what
sort
of
a
collar
it
was
around
his
neck
sitting
there
he
began
to
enjoy
himself
the
sea
glittered
in
the
sun
and
the
lees
stretched
out
opposite
him
across
the
shining
gulf
dipped
and
screamed
on
his
left
major
bevan
was
talking
to
a
flying
man
and
peter
glanced
up
with
him
to
see
an
aeroplane
that
came
humming
high
up
above
the
trees
on
the
cliff
and
flew
out
to
sea
damned
fine
type
said
the
boy
whose
tunic
for
all
his
youth
sported
wings
fritz
ca
touch
it
yet
of
course
he
copy
it
soon
enough
or
go
one
better
but
just
at
present
i
think
it
the
best
out
wish
we
got
some
in
our
circus
we
nothing
but
and
he
trailed
off
into
technicalities
peter
found
himself
studying
donovan
who
lay
back
beyond
jenks
turning
the
pages
of
an
illustrated
magazine
and
smoking
the
eyes
interested
him
they
looked
extraordinarily
clear
but
as
if
their
owner
kept
hidden
behind
them
a
vast
number
of
secrets
as
old
as
the
universe
the
face
was
lined
he
thought
but
the
face
of
a
man
who
was
no
novice
in
the
school
of
life
peter
felt
he
liked
the
captain
instinctively
he
carried
breeding
stamped
on
him
far
more
than
say
the
major
with
the
eyeglass
peter
wondered
if
they
would
meet
again
the
siren
sounded
and
a
bustle
began
as
people
put
on
their
all
on
please
said
a
young
officer
continually
who
with
a
brassard
on
his
arm
was
going
up
and
down
among
the
chairs
that
asked
peter
struggling
with
his
belt
some
poor
bloke
who
has
been
roped
in
for
crossin
duty
said
jenks
mind
my
chair
padre
bevan
and
i
are
going
below
for
a
wet
coming
skipper
not
yet
said
donovan
the
bar
too
full
at
first
for
me
padre
and
i
come
later
the
others
stepped
off
across
the
crowded
deck
and
donovan
pitched
his
magazine
into
bevan
chair
to
retain
it
you
from
south
africa
queried
peter
yes
replied
the
other
i
was
in
german
west
and
came
over
after
on
my
own
joined
up
with
the
brigade
here
what
part
of
africa
asked
peter
basutoland
padre
not
a
bad
place
in
a
way
decent
climate
topping
scenery
but
rather
a
stodgy
crowd
in
the
camps
one
or
two
decent
people
but
the
majority
without
a
blessed
notion
except
the
price
of
mealies
who
quarrel
about
nothing
half
the
time
and
talk
scandal
the
rest
good
lord
i
wish
we
had
some
of
the
perishers
out
here
but
they
know
which
side
of
the
bread
the
butter
is
bad
time
for
trade
they
say
and
every
other
trader
has
bought
a
car
since
the
war
of
course
there
something
to
be
said
for
the
other
side
but
what
gets
my
goat
is
their
pettiness
i
for
british
east
africa
after
the
war
there
a
chap
written
a
novel
about
basutoland
called
land
of
but
i
call
it
land
of
the
day
before
yesterday
i
suppose
some
of
them
came
over
with
an
assortment
of
ideas
one
time
but
they
struck
no
new
ones
since
i
do
advise
you
to
settle
in
a
south
african
dorp
if
you
can
help
it
padre
do
suppose
i
shall
said
peter
i
just
got
engaged
and
my
girl
people
would
let
her
out
of
england
engaged
are
you
thank
your
stars
you
are
married
it
safer
not
to
be
out
here
why
donovan
looked
at
him
curiously
oh
you
find
out
fast
enough
padre
he
said
wonder
what
you
make
of
it
rum
place
just
now
france
i
can
tell
you
there
the
sweepings
of
half
the
world
over
there
and
everything
turned
upside
down
fellows
are
out
for
a
spree
of
course
and
you
ca
be
hard
on
a
chap
down
from
the
line
if
he
goes
on
the
bust
a
bit
it
human
nature
and
you
must
allow
for
it
you
think
so
human
nature
can
be
controlled
said
peter
primly
can
it
retorted
the
other
even
the
cloth
does
find
it
too
easy
apparently
what
do
you
mean
demanded
peter
and
then
added
do
mind
telling
me
i
really
want
to
know
donovan
knocked
out
his
pipe
and
evaded
you
got
to
be
padre
he
said
well
i
am
said
peter
but
come
and
have
a
drink
then
interrupted
the
other
jenko
and
the
major
are
coming
back
damned
poor
whisky
said
the
latter
catching
the
rail
as
the
boat
heaved
a
bit
begging
your
pardon
padre
better
try
brandy
if
the
war
lasts
much
longer
there
be
no
whisky
worth
drinking
this
side
i
off
it
till
we
get
to
the
club
at
boulogne
peter
and
donovan
went
off
together
it
was
a
new
experience
for
peter
but
he
would
have
owned
it
they
groped
their
way
down
the
saloon
stairs
and
through
a
crowd
to
the
little
bar
what
yours
demanded
donovan
oh
i
take
the
major
advice
said
peter
for
me
soda
finished
sir
said
the
bar
steward
all
right
two
steward
said
donovan
and
swung
a
revolving
seat
near
round
for
graham
as
he
took
it
peter
noticed
the
man
opposite
his
badge
was
a
maltese
cross
but
he
wore
a
flannel
collar
and
tie
their
eyes
met
but
the
other
stared
a
bit
stonily
for
the
second
time
peter
wished
he
had
a
clerical
collar
the
next
he
was
taking
the
glass
from
the
south
african
cheerio
said
donovan
here
to
you
said
peter
and
leaned
back
with
an
assumption
of
ease
he
had
a
strange
sense
of
unreality
no
fool
and
no
puritan
he
had
naturally
however
been
little
in
such
an
atmosphere
since
ordination
he
would
have
had
a
drink
in
park
lane
with
the
utmost
ease
and
he
would
have
argued
over
it
that
the
clergy
were
not
nearly
so
out
of
touch
with
men
as
the
papers
said
but
down
here
in
the
steamer
saloon
surrounded
by
officers
in
an
atmosphere
of
indifference
to
him
and
his
office
he
felt
differently
he
was
aware
dimly
that
for
the
past
five
years
situations
in
which
he
had
been
had
been
dominated
by
him
and
that
he
as
a
clergyman
had
been
continually
the
centre
of
concern
talk
conduct
and
company
had
been
rearranged
when
he
came
in
and
it
had
happened
so
often
that
he
had
ceased
to
be
aware
of
it
but
now
he
was
a
mere
unit
of
no
particular
importance
whatever
no
one
dreamed
of
modifying
himself
particularly
because
a
clergyman
was
present
peter
clung
to
the
belief
that
it
was
not
altogether
so
but
he
was
sufficiently
conscious
of
it
and
he
was
conscious
of
liking
it
of
wanting
to
sink
back
in
it
as
a
man
sinks
back
in
an
he
felt
he
ought
not
to
do
so
and
he
made
a
kind
of
mental
effort
to
pull
himself
together
up
on
the
deck
the
world
was
very
fair
the
french
coast
was
now
clearly
visible
and
even
the
houses
of
the
town
huddled
together
as
it
seemed
but
dominated
by
a
church
on
the
hill
behind
them
a
sister
ship
containing
tommies
ploughed
steadily
along
serene
and
graceful
in
the
sunlight
and
above
an
airship
of
silvery
aluminum
bearing
the
tricoloured
circle
of
the
allies
kept
pace
with
the
swift
ship
without
an
effort
four
destroyers
were
visible
their
low
dark
shapes
ploughing
regularly
along
at
stated
intervals
and
someone
said
a
fifth
was
out
of
sight
behind
people
were
already
beginning
to
take
off
their
and
the
sailors
were
clearing
a
place
for
the
gangway
peter
found
that
donovan
had
known
what
he
was
about
for
his
party
would
be
close
to
the
gangway
without
moving
he
began
to
wonder
uneasily
what
would
be
done
on
landing
and
to
hope
that
donovan
would
be
going
his
way
no
one
had
said
a
word
about
it
he
looked
round
for
jenks
nurse
but
could
see
her
it
was
jolly
entering
the
port
the
french
houses
and
looked
foreign
although
one
could
hardly
say
why
on
the
quay
was
a
big
notice
all
officers
to
report
at
once
to
the
farther
on
was
a
board
bearing
the
letters
but
peter
hardly
liked
to
ask
in
fact
everything
went
like
clockwork
he
presently
found
himself
in
a
queue
behind
donovan
of
officers
who
were
passing
a
small
window
like
a
ticket
office
arriving
he
handed
in
papers
and
was
given
them
back
with
a
brief
all
right
beyond
donovan
had
secured
a
cab
you
be
coming
to
the
club
padre
he
asked
chuck
in
your
stuff
this
chap
take
it
down
and
bevan
with
it
let
walk
it
is
far
jenks
elected
to
go
with
his
friend
the
major
and
donovan
and
peter
set
off
over
the
cobbles
they
joined
up
with
another
small
group
and
for
the
first
time
peter
had
to
give
his
name
as
he
was
introduced
he
forgot
the
others
as
soon
as
he
heard
them
and
they
forgot
his
a
big
dublin
fusilier
officer
with
a
tiny
moustache
that
seemed
ludicrous
in
his
great
face
exchanged
a
few
sentences
with
him
they
left
the
quay
and
crossed
a
wide
space
where
a
bridge
debouched
towards
the
donovan
who
was
walking
ahead
passed
on
but
the
fusilier
suggested
to
peter
that
they
might
as
well
see
the
at
once
about
trains
entering
the
station
gates
the
now
familiar
initials
appearing
on
a
row
of
offices
before
them
to
the
left
peter
companion
demanded
the
train
to
albert
change
at
amiens
sir
said
a
clerk
in
uniform
within
and
the
fusilier
passed
on
what
time
is
the
rouen
train
asked
peter
in
his
turn
and
was
told
you
in
luck
padre
said
the
other
it
bally
rotten
getting
in
at
and
probably
the
beastly
thing
wo
go
till
five
still
it
might
be
worse
you
can
get
on
board
at
midnight
and
with
luck
get
to
sleep
if
i
were
you
i
be
down
here
early
for
yours
crowded
always
it
is
of
course
you
dine
at
the
club
peter
supposed
he
would
the
club
entrance
was
full
up
with
officers
and
more
and
more
kept
pouring
in
donovan
was
just
leaving
the
counter
on
the
right
with
some
tickets
in
his
hand
as
they
pushed
in
see
you
later
he
called
out
i
got
to
sleep
here
and
i
want
to
leave
my
traps
peter
wondered
where
but
was
too
much
occupied
in
keeping
well
behind
the
fusilier
to
think
much
at
a
kind
of
counter
a
girl
in
a
uniform
was
serving
out
tickets
of
one
sort
and
another
and
presently
the
two
of
them
were
before
her
for
a
few
francs
one
got
tickets
for
lunch
dinner
bed
a
bath
and
whatever
else
one
wanted
but
peter
had
no
french
money
the
fusilier
bought
him
the
first
two
however
and
together
they
forced
their
way
out
into
the
great
lounge
half
an
hour
before
lunch
said
his
new
companion
and
then
catching
sight
of
someone
hullo
jack
you
back
never
saw
you
on
the
boat
did
you
his
voice
trailed
off
as
he
crossed
the
room
peter
looked
around
a
little
disconsolately
then
he
made
his
way
to
a
huge
and
threw
himself
into
it
all
about
him
was
a
subdued
chatter
a
big
fire
burned
in
the
stove
and
round
it
was
a
wide
semicircle
of
chairs
against
the
wall
were
more
and
a
small
table
or
two
stood
about
nearly
every
chair
had
its
occupant
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
officers
mostly
in
undress
and
he
noticed
some
fast
asleep
with
muddied
boots
there
was
a
look
on
their
faces
even
in
sleep
and
peter
guessed
that
some
at
least
were
down
from
the
line
on
their
way
to
a
brief
leave
more
and
more
came
in
continuously
stewards
with
drinks
passed
quickly
in
and
out
about
them
the
fusilier
and
his
friend
were
just
ordering
something
peter
opened
his
case
and
took
out
a
cigarette
tapping
it
carefully
before
lighting
it
he
began
to
feel
at
home
and
lazy
and
comfortable
as
if
he
had
been
there
before
an
orderly
entered
with
envelopes
in
his
hand
lieutenant
frazer
he
called
and
looked
round
inquiringly
there
was
no
reply
and
he
turned
to
the
next
captain
saunders
still
no
reply
lieutenant
morcombe
still
no
reply
lieutenant
morcombe
he
called
again
nobody
took
any
interest
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
pushed
the
open
and
departed
then
donovan
came
in
closely
followed
by
bevan
peter
got
up
and
made
towards
them
hullo
said
bevan
have
an
appetiser
padre
lunch
will
be
on
in
twenty
minutes
what
yours
skipper
the
three
of
them
moved
on
to
peter
chair
and
bevan
dragged
up
another
peter
subsided
and
donovan
sat
on
the
edge
peter
pulled
out
his
again
and
offered
it
bevan
after
one
or
two
ineffectual
attempts
got
an
orderly
at
last
well
here
fun
he
said
cheerio
said
peter
he
remembered
donovan
had
said
that
in
the
saloon
chapter
iii
jenks
being
attached
to
the
engaged
in
feeding
daily
more
than
men
in
the
rouen
area
peter
and
he
travelled
together
by
the
latter
advice
they
reached
the
soon
after
but
even
so
the
train
seemed
full
there
were
no
lights
in
the
siding
and
none
whatever
on
the
train
so
that
it
was
only
by
matches
that
one
could
tell
if
a
compartment
was
full
or
empty
except
in
the
case
of
those
from
which
and
much
noise
proclaimed
the
former
indisputably
at
last
however
somewhere
up
near
the
engine
they
found
a
carriage
apparently
unoccupied
with
a
big
ticket
marked
reserved
upon
it
jenks
struck
a
match
and
regarded
this
critically
well
padre
he
said
as
it
does
say
for
whom
it
is
reserved
i
guess
it
may
as
well
be
reserved
for
us
so
here
goes
he
swung
up
and
tugged
at
the
door
which
for
some
time
refused
to
give
then
it
opened
suddenly
and
jenks
subsided
gracefully
and
luridly
on
the
ground
outside
peter
struck
another
match
and
peered
in
it
was
then
observed
that
the
compartment
was
not
empty
but
that
a
lanky
youth
stretched
completely
along
one
seat
was
regarding
them
solemnly
this
carriage
is
reserved
he
said
yes
said
jenks
cheerfully
for
us
sir
may
i
ask
what
you
are
doing
in
it
the
awakened
one
sighed
it
worked
before
and
if
you
chaps
come
in
and
shut
the
door
quickly
perhaps
it
will
work
again
three
not
too
bad
but
i
seen
six
in
these
perishing
cars
come
in
quickly
for
the
lord
sake
peter
looked
round
him
curiously
two
of
the
four
windows
were
broken
and
the
glory
had
departed
from
the
upholstery
there
was
no
light
and
it
would
appear
that
a
heavier
body
than
that
designed
for
it
had
travelled
upon
the
rack
jenks
was
swearing
away
to
himself
and
trying
to
light
a
peter
laughed
got
any
cards
asked
the
original
owner
yes
said
jenks
got
any
grub
and
chocolate
and
half
a
of
whisky
replied
the
original
owner
and
we
shall
need
them
good
enough
said
jenks
and
the
padre
here
has
plenty
of
sandwiches
for
he
ordered
a
double
lot
do
you
play
auction
padre
queried
what
turned
out
in
the
to
be
a
canadian
peter
assented
he
was
moderately
good
he
knew
this
fairly
roused
the
canadian
he
swung
his
legs
off
the
seat
and
groped
for
the
door
hang
on
to
this
you
men
he
said
and
i
get
a
fourth
i
kidded
some
fellows
of
ours
with
that
notice
just
now
but
i
know
them
and
i
can
get
a
decent
chap
to
come
in
he
was
gone
a
few
minutes
only
then
voices
sounded
outside
been
looking
for
you
old
dear
said
their
friend
only
two
sportsmen
here
and
a
nice
little
show
all
to
ourselves
tumble
in
and
we
get
cheerful
not
that
seat
old
dear
but
wait
a
jiffy
let
sort
things
out
first
they
snorted
out
of
the
dreary
tunnel
into
rouen
in
the
first
daylight
of
the
next
morning
peter
looked
eagerly
at
the
great
winding
river
and
the
glory
of
the
cathedral
as
it
towered
up
above
the
mists
that
hung
over
the
houses
there
was
a
fresh
taste
of
spring
in
the
air
and
the
smoke
curled
clear
and
blue
from
the
barges
on
the
water
the
bare
trees
on
the
island
showed
every
twig
and
thin
branch
as
if
they
had
been
pencilled
against
the
flood
beneath
a
tug
puffed
fussily
upstream
red
and
yellow
markings
on
its
grimy
black
jenks
was
asleep
in
the
corner
but
he
woke
as
they
clattered
across
the
bridge
he
sighed
stretching
back
to
the
old
graft
again
yet
once
more
peter
began
to
collect
his
belongings
it
seemed
ages
since
he
had
got
into
the
train
at
victoria
and
he
felt
particularly
grubby
and
unshaven
what
the
next
move
he
asked
jenks
eyed
him
going
to
take
a
taxi
he
queried
where
to
said
peter
well
if
you
ask
me
padre
he
replied
i
do
see
what
against
a
decent
and
breakfast
at
the
club
it
does
much
matter
when
i
report
and
the
club
handy
for
your
show
i
know
the
office
because
it
in
the
same
house
as
the
base
cashier
and
the
club
just
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
but
it
the
deuce
of
a
way
from
the
station
if
we
can
get
a
taxi
i
vote
we
take
it
agreed
peter
you
lead
on
they
tumbled
out
on
the
platform
and
produced
the
necessary
papers
at
the
exit
labelled
british
officers
only
a
military
policeman
wrote
down
particulars
on
a
paper
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
out
among
the
crowd
of
peasantry
in
the
jenks
pushed
through
and
had
secured
a
cab
by
the
time
peter
arrived
there
is
a
taxi
to
be
got
padre
he
said
but
this
do
they
rolled
off
down
an
avenue
of
wintry
trees
passed
a
wooden
building
which
peter
was
informed
was
the
english
military
church
and
out
on
to
the
quay
to
peter
the
drive
was
an
intense
delight
a
french
regiment
swung
past
them
going
up
the
line
said
jenks
a
crowd
of
black
troops
marched
by
in
the
opposite
direction
good
lord
said
jenks
so
the
native
labour
has
come
the
river
was
full
of
craft
but
his
mentor
explained
that
the
true
docks
stretched
mile
on
mile
downstream
by
a
wide
bridge
lay
a
camouflaged
steamer
hospital
ship
said
jenks
up
a
narrow
street
could
be
seen
the
buttresses
of
the
cathedral
and
if
peter
craned
his
head
to
glance
up
his
companion
was
more
occupied
in
the
great
café
at
the
corner
a
little
farther
on
but
it
was
of
course
deserted
at
that
early
hour
a
at
the
corner
was
gay
with
flowers
and
two
french
peasant
women
were
arranging
the
blooms
and
then
the
fiacre
swung
into
the
rue
joanne
and
opposite
a
entrance
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
here
we
are
said
jenks
it
up
an
infernal
flight
of
steps
the
officers
club
in
rouen
was
not
monstrously
attractive
but
they
got
a
good
wash
in
a
little
room
that
looked
out
over
a
tangle
of
picturesque
roofs
and
finally
some
excellent
coffee
and
bacon
and
eggs
jenks
lit
a
cigarette
and
handed
one
to
peter
better
leave
your
traps
he
said
i
go
up
with
you
i
nothing
to
do
outside
the
street
was
filling
with
the
morning
traffic
and
the
two
walked
up
the
slight
hill
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
running
fire
of
comments
and
explanations
from
jenks
that
cox
useful
place
for
the
first
half
of
a
month
but
not
much
use
to
me
anyway
for
the
second
you
ought
to
go
to
i
that
shop
and
buy
picture
padre
there
a
topping
girl
who
sells
rue
de
la
grosse
horloge
you
can
see
the
clock
hanging
over
the
road
the
street
runs
up
to
the
cathedral
rather
jolly
sometimes
but
nothing
doing
now
what
that
i
do
know
yes
i
do
palais
de
justice
or
something
of
that
sort
pretty
old
i
believe
in
those
gardens
is
the
picture
gallery
not
been
in
myself
but
i
believe
they
got
some
good
stuff
that
your
show
over
there
do
be
long
i
hang
about
peter
crossed
the
street
and
following
directions
ascended
some
wooden
stairs
a
door
round
the
corner
at
the
top
was
inscribed
of
and
he
went
up
to
it
there
he
cogitated
ought
one
to
knock
or
being
in
uniform
walk
straight
in
he
could
not
think
of
any
reason
why
one
should
not
knock
being
in
uniform
so
he
knocked
come
in
said
a
voice
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
at
a
desk
before
him
sat
a
rather
elderly
man
who
eyed
him
keenly
on
his
left
with
his
back
to
him
was
a
man
in
uniform
pattering
away
busily
on
a
typewriter
and
for
the
rest
the
room
contained
a
few
chairs
a
coloured
print
of
the
light
of
the
world
over
the
fireplace
and
a
torn
map
peter
again
hesitated
he
wondered
what
was
the
rank
of
the
officer
in
the
chair
and
if
he
ought
to
salute
while
he
hesitated
the
other
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
peter
horribly
nervous
made
a
at
saluting
and
stepped
forward
my
name
graham
sir
he
said
i
just
come
over
and
was
told
in
the
office
in
london
to
report
to
colonel
chichester
at
rouen
the
other
put
him
at
his
ease
at
once
he
rose
and
held
a
hand
out
over
the
littered
desk
how
do
you
do
mr
graham
he
said
we
were
expecting
you
i
am
the
here
and
we
plenty
for
you
to
do
take
a
seat
wo
you
i
believe
i
once
heard
you
preach
at
my
place
down
in
suffolk
you
were
at
thomas
were
you
down
by
the
river
peter
warmed
to
the
welcome
it
was
strangely
familiar
after
the
past
hours
to
hear
himself
called
and
despite
the
uniforms
and
the
surroundings
he
felt
he
might
be
in
the
presence
of
a
vicar
in
england
some
of
his
old
confidence
began
to
return
he
replied
freely
to
the
questions
presently
the
other
glanced
at
his
watch
well
he
said
i
got
to
go
over
to
and
you
had
better
be
getting
to
your
quarters
where
did
i
place
captain
graham
martin
the
orderly
at
the
desk
leaned
sideways
and
glanced
at
a
paper
pinned
on
the
desk
no
rest
camp
sir
he
said
ah
yes
i
remember
now
you
can
get
a
tram
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
that
will
take
you
nearly
all
the
way
it
a
pretty
place
on
the
edge
of
the
country
you
find
about
one
thousand
men
in
camp
and
the
name
is
what
is
it
martin
captain
harold
sir
harold
that
it
a
decent
chap
the
men
are
constantly
coming
and
going
but
there
a
good
deal
to
do
is
there
a
chapel
in
the
camp
asked
peter
oh
no
i
do
think
so
you
use
the
canteen
there
a
quiet
room
there
you
can
borrow
for
celebrations
there
a
camp
next
door
one
way
and
a
south
african
native
labour
corps
lot
the
other
but
they
have
their
own
chaplains
we
let
you
down
easy
at
first
but
you
might
see
if
you
can
fix
up
a
service
or
so
for
the
men
in
the
forest
a
labour
company
out
there
cutting
wood
maybe
you
be
able
to
get
a
lift
out
in
a
car
but
get
your
to
indent
for
a
bicycle
if
there
is
one
drop
in
and
see
me
some
day
and
tell
me
how
you
are
getting
on
i
find
you
some
more
work
later
on
peter
got
up
the
other
held
out
his
hand
which
peter
took
and
then
remembering
days
at
oxford
firmly
and
unblushingly
saluted
the
colonel
made
a
little
motion
he
said
and
peter
found
himself
outside
the
door
no
rest
camp
said
jenks
a
moment
later
you
in
luck
padre
it
a
topping
camp
and
the
skipper
is
an
awfully
good
sort
beast
of
a
long
way
out
though
you
have
to
have
a
taxi
now
the
said
a
tram
would
do
said
peter
then
he
talked
through
his
blooming
hat
replied
the
other
probably
never
been
there
in
his
little
life
it
two
miles
beyond
the
tram
terminus
if
it
a
yard
my
place
is
just
across
the
river
and
there
a
ferry
that
pretty
well
drops
you
there
tell
you
what
i
do
i
see
you
down
and
then
skip
over
what
about
your
stuff
though
queried
peter
oh
bless
you
i
can
get
a
lorry
to
collect
that
that
one
use
in
being
at
any
rate
it
jolly
decent
of
you
said
peter
not
a
bit
old
dear
returned
the
other
you
the
right
sort
padre
and
i
at
a
loose
end
just
now
besides
i
like
to
see
old
harold
he
one
of
the
best
come
on
they
found
a
taxi
this
time
near
the
gare
du
vert
and
ran
quickly
out
first
over
cobbles
then
down
a
wide
avenue
with
a
macadamised
surface
which
paralleled
the
river
downstream
main
road
to
havre
volunteered
jenks
i
been
through
once
or
twice
with
our
stuff
it
a
jolly
pretty
run
and
you
can
lunch
in
candebec
with
a
bit
of
luck
which
is
one
of
the
of
the
seine
you
know
the
road
gave
on
open
country
in
a
few
miles
though
there
were
camps
to
be
seen
between
it
and
the
river
with
wharves
and
buildings
at
intervals
and
ahead
a
biggish
waterside
village
just
short
of
that
they
pulled
up
a
remarked
no
rest
camp
and
peter
saw
he
had
arrived
the
sun
was
well
up
by
this
time
and
his
spirits
with
it
the
country
smiled
in
the
clear
light
behind
the
camp
fields
ran
up
to
a
thick
wood
through
which
wound
a
road
and
the
river
was
just
opposite
them
a
sentry
came
to
attention
as
they
passed
in
sloped
arms
and
saluted
peter
stared
at
him
you
ought
to
take
the
salute
padre
said
jenks
you
senior
to
me
you
know
they
passed
down
a
regular
street
of
huts
most
of
which
had
little
patches
of
garden
before
them
in
which
the
green
of
some
early
spring
flowers
was
already
showing
and
stopped
before
the
jenks
said
he
would
look
in
and
see
if
the
skipper
were
inside
and
in
a
second
or
two
came
out
with
a
man
whom
he
introduced
as
captain
harold
with
them
was
a
tall
young
scots
officer
in
a
kilt
whom
peter
learned
was
lieutenant
mackay
of
their
mess
glad
to
see
you
padre
said
harold
our
last
man
was
up
to
much
and
jenks
says
you
a
sport
i
finished
in
there
so
come
on
to
the
mess
and
let
have
a
spot
for
luck
come
on
scottie
eleven
all
right
for
you
is
it
sha
say
no
said
the
gentleman
addressed
and
they
passed
behind
the
and
in
at
an
open
door
peter
glanced
curiously
round
the
place
was
very
cheerful
a
fire
burning
and
gay
pictures
on
the
wall
rather
neat
is
it
padre
queried
harold
by
the
way
you
got
to
dub
up
a
picture
everyone
in
the
mess
gives
one
there
a
blank
space
over
there
that
do
nicely
for
a
kirschner
if
you
sport
enough
for
that
jenko
show
you
where
to
get
a
topper
what
yours
old
son
same
as
usual
skipper
said
jenks
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
harold
walked
across
to
a
little
shuttered
window
and
tapped
a
face
appeared
in
the
opening
four
whiskies
hunter
that
all
right
padre
yes
said
peter
and
walked
to
the
fire
while
the
talk
became
general
first
time
over
queried
mackay
well
how
town
asked
harold
good
shows
on
i
ought
to
be
due
next
month
but
i
think
i
wait
a
bit
want
to
get
over
in
the
spring
and
see
a
bit
of
the
country
too
what
do
they
think
of
the
war
over
there
jenko
it
going
to
be
over
by
summer
there
a
big
push
coming
off
this
spring
and
fritz
ca
stand
much
more
he
starving
and
has
no
reserves
worth
talking
of
the
east
does
not
matter
though
the
doings
at
salonika
have
depressed
them
no
end
this
show
going
to
be
won
on
the
west
and
that
quickly
got
it
old
bean
good
old
blighty
ejaculated
harold
but
they
do
really
believe
all
that
do
they
padre
they
do
said
peter
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
wondered
if
i
be
over
in
time
myself
surely
the
yanks
must
come
in
and
make
a
difference
this
time
next
year
perhaps
though
i
doubt
it
what
do
you
think
scottie
oh
ask
another
i
sick
of
it
say
skipper
what
about
that
run
out
into
the
forest
you
talked
of
good
enough
would
you
care
to
go
padre
there
a
crowd
out
there
and
i
want
to
see
about
firewood
there
a
car
possible
and
we
could
all
pack
in
count
me
out
said
jenks
i
have
to
toddle
over
and
report
sorry
all
the
same
i
love
it
said
peter
besides
the
said
i
was
to
look
up
those
people
oh
well
done
it
is
a
at
all
then
have
another
padre
and
let
get
off
no
well
i
will
how
yours
scottie
ten
minutes
later
the
three
of
them
got
into
a
big
car
and
glided
smoothly
off
first
along
the
river
and
then
up
a
steep
road
into
the
forest
peter
fresh
from
london
lay
back
and
enjoyed
it
immensely
he
had
no
idea
normandy
boasted
such
woods
and
the
world
looked
very
good
to
him
it
was
all
about
as
different
from
what
he
had
imagined
as
it
could
possibly
have
been
he
just
set
himself
to
appreciate
it
the
forest
was
largely
fir
and
pine
and
the
sunlight
glanced
down
the
straight
trunks
and
patterned
on
the
carpet
beneath
hollies
gleamed
green
against
the
brown
background
and
in
an
open
space
of
bare
beech
trees
the
littered
ground
was
already
pricked
with
the
new
green
of
the
wild
hyacinth
now
and
again
the
rounded
hills
gave
glimpses
of
the
far
normandy
plain
across
the
serpentine
river
then
would
as
suddenly
close
in
on
them
again
until
the
car
seemed
to
dart
between
the
advancing
battalions
of
the
forest
as
though
to
escape
capture
at
length
in
one
such
place
they
leaped
forward
up
a
short
rise
then
rushed
swiftly
downhill
swung
round
a
corner
and
came
out
on
what
had
become
all
but
a
bare
tableland
set
high
so
that
one
could
see
distant
valleys
boscherville
duclair
and
yet
bare
for
the
timber
had
been
all
but
entirely
cut
down
five
hundred
yards
along
this
road
brought
them
to
a
small
encampment
there
were
some
lines
of
nysson
huts
a
canteen
with
an
inverted
triangle
for
sign
some
tents
great
stacks
of
timber
and
of
smaller
wood
a
few
lorries
drawn
up
and
silent
and
beyond
two
or
three
buildings
of
wood
set
down
by
themselves
with
a
garden
in
front
and
a
notice
quarters
here
then
captain
harold
stopped
the
car
and
they
got
out
there
were
some
jovial
introductions
and
presently
the
whole
party
set
off
across
the
cleared
space
to
where
in
the
distance
one
could
see
the
edge
of
the
forest
peter
did
not
want
to
talk
and
dropped
a
little
behind
harold
and
the
of
the
forestry
were
on
in
front
and
mackay
with
a
junior
local
officer
were
skirmishing
about
on
the
right
taking
with
small
chunks
of
wood
at
the
stumps
of
trees
and
behaving
rather
like
two
the
air
was
all
heavy
with
resinous
scent
and
the
carpet
beneath
soft
with
moss
and
leaves
and
fragrant
slips
of
pine
here
and
there
on
a
definite
plan
a
small
tree
had
been
spared
and
when
he
joined
the
men
ahead
peter
learned
how
careful
were
the
french
in
all
this
apparently
wholesale
felling
in
the
forest
as
they
saw
as
they
reached
it
the
lines
were
numbered
and
lettered
and
in
some
distant
office
every
woodland
group
was
known
with
its
place
and
age
there
are
few
foresters
like
the
french
and
it
was
cheering
to
think
that
this
great
levelling
would
in
a
score
of
years
do
more
good
than
harm
slowly
biting
into
the
untouched
regiments
of
trees
were
the
men
helped
in
their
work
by
a
small
power
engine
the
great
trunks
were
lopped
and
roughly
squared
here
and
then
dragged
by
motor
traction
to
a
slide
which
they
now
went
to
view
it
was
a
fascinating
sight
the
forest
ended
abruptly
on
a
high
hill
and
below
at
their
feet
wound
the
river
far
down
working
on
a
wharf
that
had
been
constructed
of
piles
driven
into
the
mud
was
a
belgian
detachment
with
german
prisoners
and
near
the
wharf
rough
sheds
housed
the
cutting
plant
where
they
stood
was
the
head
of
a
big
slide
with
sides
and
the
forest
giants
brought
to
the
top
from
the
place
where
they
were
felled
were
levered
over
to
swish
down
in
a
cloud
of
dust
to
the
waiting
men
beneath
well
skipper
what
about
the
firewood
asked
harold
as
they
stood
gazing
how
much
do
you
want
asked
the
forestry
oh
well
what
can
you
let
me
have
you
got
stacks
of
odd
stuff

you
can
spare
a
bit
it
clean
agin
regulations
but
could
you
send
for
it
rather
there
an
camp
below
us
and
the
men
there
promised
me
a
lorry
if
i
share
the
spoils
with
them
will
that
do
all
right
when
will
you
send
up
what

listened
and
now
cut
in
excuse

he
said
but
i
was
told
i
ought
to
try
and
get
a
service
of
some
sort
out
here
could
i
come
out
on
the
lorry
and
hold
one
delighted
padre
of
course
i
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
about
eleven
probably
you
wo
get
many
men
as
there
are
usually
inspection
parades
and
some
extra
fatigues
on
sunday
but
i
put
it
in
orders
we
have
had
a
padre
for
a
long
time
eleven

said
peter
if
captain
harold
thinks
the
lorry
can
get
up
here
by
that
time
will
it
sir
oh
i
should
think
so
and
anyway
an
hour
or
so
wo
make
much
difference
if
i
can
i
come

you
myself
but
i
say
we
ought
to
be
getting
back
now
it
will
be
infernally
late
for
luncheon
come
and
have
a
drink
before
you
start
anyway
said
the
and
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
camp
and
into
an
enclosure
made
of
bushes
and
logs
in
the
rear
of
the
mess
where
rustic
seats
and
a
table
had
been
constructed
under
the
shade
of
a
giant
oak
it
rattling
here
in
summer
he
said
and
we
have
most
of
our
meals
out
of
doors
sit
down
wo
you
orderly
by
jove
you
people
are
comfortable
out
here
said
harold
wish
i
had
a
job
of
this
sort
oh
i
do
know
skipper
it
would
feed
you
up
after
a
while
i
think
it
bally
lonely
in
the
evening
and
we
ca
always
get
a
car
to
town
it
a
damned
nuisance
getting
out
again
too
then
as
the
orderly
brought
glasses
and
a
bottle
have
a
spot
it
haig
and
haig
mackay
and
the
right
stuff
jolly
good
sir
said
that
worthy
critically
people
think
because
i
do
talk
broad
scots
i
no
highlander
but
when
it
comes
to
the
whisky
i
got
a
scottish
thirst
say
when
sir
peter
had
another
because
he
was
warm
with
the
sense
of
good
comradeship
and
was
warmer
still
when
he
climbed
into
the
car
ten
minutes
later
life
seemed
so
simple
and
easy
and
he
was
struck
with
the
cheeriness
of
his
new
friends
and
the
ready
welcome
to
himself
and
his
duty
he
waved
to
the
see
you
sunday
sir
he
called
out
eleven
you
forget
to
put
it
in
orders
will
you
cheerio
let
go
round
by
the
lower
road
skipper
said
mackay
we
can
look
in
at
that
toppin
little
pub
what
its
name
croix
something
and
besides
the
surface
is
capital
down
there
and
see
marie
eh
but
do
forget
you
got
a
padre
aboard
oh
he
all
right
and
if
he
going
to
be
out
here
it
time
he
knew
marie
graham
laughed
carry
on
he
said
it
all
one
to
me
where
we
go
skipper
he
lay
back
more
comfortably
than
ever
and
the
big
car
leaped
forward
through
the
forest
ever
descending
towards
the
river
level
soon
the
trees
thinned
and
they
were
skirting
ploughed
fields
presently
they
ran
through
a
little
village
where
a
german
prisoner
straightened
himself
from
his
work
in
a
garden
and
saluted
then
through
a
wood
which
suddenly
gave
a
vista
of
an
avenue
to
a
stately
house
turreted
in
the
french
style
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
then
over
a
little
stream
then
round
a
couple
of
corners
past
a
dreamy
old
church
and
a
long
immemorial
wall
and
so
out
into
the
straight
road
along
the
river
the
sun
gleamed
on
the
water
and
there
were
ships
in
view
a
british
and
a
couple
of
norwegian
tramps
ploughing
slowly
down
to
the
sea
on
the
far
bank
the
level
of
the
land
was
low
but
on
this
side
only
some
narrow
and
here
and
there
lush
separated
them
from
the
hills
the
croix
de
guerre
stood
back
from
the
road
in
a
long
garden
just
where
a
forest
wound
down
through
a
tiny
village
to
the
main
road
their
chauffeur
backed
the
car
all
but
out
of
sight
into
this
path
after
they
climbed
out
and
the
three
of
them
made
for
a
sidedoor
in
a
high
wall
harold
opened
it
and
walked
in
the
pretty
trim
little
garden
had
a
few
flowers
in
bloom
so
sheltered
was
it
and
mackay
picked
a
red
rosebud
as
they
walked
up
the
path
harold
led
the
way
without
ceremony
into
a
parlour
that
opened
off
a
verandah
and
finding
it
empty
opened
a
door
beyond
marie
marie
he
called
ah
monsieur
le
capitaine
i
come
came
a
girl
voice
and
marie
entered
peter
noticed
how
rapidly
she
took
them
all
in
and
how
cold
were
the
eyes
that
nevertheless
sparkled
and
greeted
harold
and
mackay
with
seeming
gaiety
she
was
short
and
dark
and
not
particularly
but
she
had
all
the
vivacity
and
charm
of
the
french
oh
monsieur
where
have
you
been
for
so
long
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
la
croix
de
guerre
altogether
it
the
two
weeks
no
since
you
come
here
the
gentlemen
will
have
déjeuner
and
perhaps
a
little
aperitif
before
bon
jour
marie
began
the
captain
in
clumsy
french
and
then
abandoned
the
attempt
i
could
not
come
marie
you
know
la
guerre
much
work
each
day
ah
non
monsieur
can
not
cheat
me
he
had
found
another
cafe
and
another
girl
non
non
monsieur
it
is
not
correct
and
the
girl
drew
herself
up
with
a
curiously
changed
air
as
harold
clumsily
reached
out
towards
her
protesting
and
you
have
a
curé
here
how
do
you
say
a
chapelain
and
marie
beamed
on
peter
the
two
officers
looked
at
him
and
laughed
what
can
i
bring
you
monsieur
le
capitaine
le
curé
demanded
the
girl
vermuth
cognac
mackay
slipped
from
the
edge
of
the
table
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
advanced
towards
her
speaking
fluent
french
with
a
curious
suggestion
of
a
scotch
accent
that
never
appeared
in
his
english
peter
watched
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
a
curious
medley
of
feelings
while
the
lieutenant
explained
that
they
could
not
stop
to
lunch
that
they
would
take
three
mixed
vermuth
and
that
he
would
come
and
help
her
get
them
they
went
out
together
marie
protesting
and
harold
lighting
a
cigarette
and
offering
one
to
peter
said
with
a
laugh
he
the
boy
is
mackay
wish
i
could
sling
the
lingo
like
him
it
a
great
country
padre
in
a
minute
or
two
the
pair
of
them
came
back
marie
was
wearing
the
rose
at
the
point
of
the
little
of
her
black
dress
and
was
all
over
smiles
she
carried
a
tray
with
glasses
and
a
bottle
mackay
carried
the
other
with
a
great
show
he
helped
her
pour
out
and
chatted
away
in
french
while
they
drank
harold
and
peter
talked
together
but
the
latter
caught
scraps
of
the
others
conversation
mackay
wanted
to
know
apparently
when
she
would
be
next
in
town
and
was
urging
a
date
on
her
peter
caught
rue
jeanne
but
little
more
and
harold
was
insistent
on
a
move
in
a
few
minutes
they
skirmished
at
the
door
saying
but
it
was
with
an
increased
feeling
of
the
warmth
and
jollity
of
his
new
life
that
peter
once
more
boarded
the
car
this
time
mackay
got
in
front
and
harold
joined
graham
behind
as
they
sped
off
peter
said
by
jove
skipper
you
do
have
a
good
time
out
here
harold
flicked
off
the
ash
of
his
cigarette
so
so
padre
he
said
but
the
devil
loose
it
all
so
easy
i
never
met
a
girl
yet
who
was
not
out
for
a
spree
of
course
we
do
see
anything
of
the
real
french
ladies
though
and
this
is
the
line
by
god
when
i
think
of
the
boys
up
there
i
feel
a
beast
sometimes
but
i
ca
help
it
they
wo
pass
me
to
go
up
and
it
no
use
growling
down
here
because
of
it
i
suppose
not
said
peter
and
leaned
back
reflecting
for
the
rest
of
the
way
he
felt
as
if
he
had
known
these
men
all
his
days
and
as
if
his
london
life
had
been
lived
on
another
planet
after
lunch
he
was
given
a
cubicle
and
spent
an
hour
or
two
getting
unpacked
that
done
just
as
he
was
about
to
sit
down
to
a
letter
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
mackay
looked
in
you
there
padre
he
asked
there
a
lorry
going
up
to
town
that
has
just
brought
a
batch
of
men
in
would
you
care
to
come
i
got
to
do
some
shopping
and
we
could
dine
at
the
club
and
come
back
afterwards
peter
jumped
up
topping
he
said
i
want
to
get
one
or
two
things
and
i
love
it
come
on
then
said
the
other
i
meet
you
at
the
gate
in
five
minutes
peter
got
on
his
sam
browne
and
went
out
and
after
a
bit
mackay
joined
him
they
jolted
up
to
town
and
went
first
to
the
officers
store
at
the
mackay
bought
some
cigarettes
and
peter
some
flannel
collars
and
a
tie
together
the
pair
of
them
strolled
round
town
and
put
their
heads
in
at
the
cathedral
at
peter
request
he
had
a
vision
of
old
grey
stone
and
coloured
glass
and
wide
soaring
spaces
but
his
impatient
companion
hauled
him
out
of
course
you
want
to
see
round
padre
he
said
but
you
can
do
it
some
other
time
and
with
somebody
else
i
seen
it
once
and
that
enough
for
me
let
get
on
to
the
club
and
book
a
table
there
usually
a
fearful
crowd
peter
was
immensely
impressed
with
the
crowd
of
men
the
easy
greetings
of
acquaintances
and
the
way
in
which
one
was
ignored
by
the
rest
he
was
introduced
to
several
people
who
were
all
very
cheerful
and
in
the
long
they
eventually
sat
down
to
table
with
two
more
officers
whom
the
scotsman
knew
peter
was
rather
taken
with
a
tall
man
slightly
bald
of
the
rank
of
captain
who
was
attached
to
a
labour
corps
he
had
travelled
a
great
deal
and
been
badly
knocked
about
in
gallipoli
in
a
way
he
was
more
serious
than
the
rest
and
he
told
peter
a
good
deal
about
the
sights
of
the
town
the
old
houses
and
churches
and
where
was
the
best
glass
and
so
on
mackay
and
the
fourth
made
merry
and
mackay
who
called
the
waitress
by
her
christian
name
was
plainly
getting
peter
friend
was
obviously
a
little
scornful
you
meet
a
lot
of
fools
here
padre
he
said
old
and
young
the
other
day
i
was
having
tea
here
when
two
old
buffers
came
in
shoved
into
some
job
or
another
and
they
sat
down
at
the
table
next
mine
i
could
help
hearing
what
they
said
the
older
and
fatter
a
colonel
looked
out
of
window
and
remarked
ponderously
the
way
was
joan
of
arc
born
about
here
said
the
second
in
i
believe
she
was
burnt
here
and
they
threw
her
ashes
into
the
grand
pont
peter
laughed
silently
and
the
other
smiled
at
him
fact
he
said
that
one
type
of
ass
and
the
second
is
dropping
his
voice
your
friend
here
and
his
like
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
look
at
him
with
that
girl
now
somebody
spot
it
and
they
keep
an
eye
on
him
next
time
he
meets
her
on
the
sly
he
be
caught
out
and
be
up
for
it
damned
silly
fool
i
think
the
bally
girl
only
a
waitress
from
lyons
peter
glanced
at
mackay
he
was
leaning
back
holding
the
menu
which
she
with
covert
glances
at
the
cashier
desk
was
trying
to
take
away
from
him
isobel
he
said
i
say
come
here
no
i
really
want
to
see
it
tell
me
when
do
you
get
out
next
we
do
get
no
leave
worth
talking
of
you
know
she
said
besides
you
do
mean
it
you
ca
talk
to
me
outside
oh
shut
up
i
must
go
they
see
us
and
she
darted
away
damned
pretty
girl
eh
said
mackay
contentedly
do
mind
me
padre
it
only
a
bit
of
a
joke
come
on
let
clear
out
the
four
went
down
the
stairs
together
and
stood
in
a
little
group
at
the
where
you
for
now
mac
asked
the
second
officer
a
subaltern
of
the
west
hampshires
do
know
old
sport
i
with
the
padre
what
you
for
padre
i
should
think
we
had
better
be
getting
back
said
peter
glancing
at
the
watch
on
his
wrist
we
a
long
way
to
go
oh
hang
it
all
not
yet
it
a
topping
evenin
let
stroll
up
the
street
peter
glanced
at
the
labour
corps
captain
who
nodded
and
they
two
turned
off
together
there
not
much
to
do
he
said
one
gets
sick
of
cinemas
and
the
is
worse
except
when
one
is
really
warmed
up
for
a
i
do
wonder
these
chaps
go
after
wine
and
women
more
than
they
ought
after
all
most
of
them
are
just
loose
from
home
you
must
make
allowances
padre
it
human
nature
you
know
peter
nodded
abstractedly
it
was
the
second
time
he
had
heard
that
it
all
so
jolly
different
from
what
i
expected
he
said
meditatively
i
know
said
the
other
not
much
danger
or
poverty
or
suffering
here
seemingly
but
you
never
can
tell
look
at
those
girls
i
bet
you
would
probably
sum
them
up
altogether
wrongly
if
you
tried
peter
glanced
at
a
couple
of
french
women
who
were
passing
the
pair
were
looking
at
them
and
in
the
light
of
a
brilliantly
lit
cinema
they
showed
up
clearly
the
paint
was
laid
on
shamelessly
their
costumes
made
in
one
piece
were
edged
with
fur
and
very
gay
each
carried
a
handbag
and
one
a
tasselled
stick
chérie
said
one
as
they
passed
peter
gave
a
little
shudder
how
ghastly
he
said
how
can
anyone
speak
to
them
are
there
many
like
that
about
he
glanced
back
again
why
good
heavens
he
cried
one
marie
hullo
padre
said
his
friend
the
ghost
of
a
smile
beginning
about
his
lips
where
have
you
been
marie
by
jove
i
shall
have
to
report
you
to
the
peter
blushed
furiously
it
was
at
an
inn
he
said
this
morning
as
we
were
coming
back
from
the
forest
but
she
seemed
so
much
better
then
mackay
knew
her
why
i
heard
him
say
he
glanced
back
at
the
sudden
recollection
the
two
girls
were
speaking
to
the
two
others
twenty
paces
or
so
behind
oh
he
exclaimed
look
here
the
tall
labour
man
slipped
his
arm
in
his
and
interrupted
come
on
padre
he
said
you
ca
do
anything
mackay
had
a
bit
too
much
as
it
is
and
the
other
chap
is
looking
for
a
night
out
we
stroll
past
the
cathedral
and
i
see
you
a
bit
of
the
way
home
but
how
damnable
how
beastly
exclaimed
peter
it
makes
one
sick
he
broke
off
and
the
two
walked
on
in
silence
is
there
much
of
that
peter
demanded
suddenly
the
other
glanced
at
him
you
find
out
without
my
telling
you
he
said
but
do
be
too
vehement
till
you
got
your
eyes
open
there
are
worse
things
there
ca
be
broke
in
peter
women
like
that
and
men
who
will
go
with
them
are
fit
to
be
called
men
and
women
there
no
excuse
bestial
that
what
it
is
you
would
speak
to
one
queried
the
other
good
heavens
no
do
you
forget
what
i
am
no
i
do
padre
but
look
here
i
not
a
christian
and
i
take
a
view
of
these
things
but
i
bound
to
say
i
think
you
on
the
wrong
tack
too
did
christ
have
compassion
on
people
like
that
did
he
eat
and
drink
with
publicans
and
sinners
yes
to
convert
them
you
ca
name
the
two
things
in
the
same
breath
he
had
compassion
on
the
multitude
of
hungry
women
and
children
and
misguided
men
but
he
hated
sin
you
ca
deny
that
peter
recalled
his
sermon
he
was
rather
indignant
unreasonably
that
the
suggestion
should
have
been
made
so
said
the
other
laconically
well
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
do
i
suppose
come
on
we
go
down
here
they
parted
at
the
corner
by
the
river
again
and
peter
set
out
for
his
long
walk
home
alone
it
was
a
lovely
evening
of
stars
cool
but
not
too
cold
and
at
first
the
streets
were
full
of
people
he
kept
to
the
curb
or
walked
in
the
road
till
he
was
out
of
the
town
taking
salutes
automatically
his
thoughts
far
away
the
little
were
crowded
largely
by
tommies
he
was
not
accosted
again
for
he
walked
fast
but
he
saw
enough
as
he
went
more
than
an
hour
later
he
swung
into
camp
and
went
to
his
room
lit
a
candle
and
shut
the
door
tunic
off
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
and
stared
at
the
light
he
seemed
to
have
lived
a
year
in
a
day
and
he
felt
unclean
he
thought
of
hilda
and
then
actually
smiled
for
hilda
and
this
life
seemed
so
incredibly
far
apart
he
could
not
conceive
of
her
even
knowing
of
its
existence
yet
he
supposed
she
knew
as
he
had
done
that
such
things
were
he
had
even
preached
about
them
it
suddenly
struck
him
that
he
had
talked
rot
in
the
pulpit
talked
of
things
of
which
he
knew
nothing
yet
of
course
his
attitude
had
been
right
he
wondered
if
he
should
speak
to
mackay
and
so
wondering
fell
forward
on
his
knees
chapter
iv
hilda
religion
was
like
the
religion
of
a
great
many
englishwomen
of
her
class
of
a
very
curious
sort
she
never
of
course
analysed
it
herself
and
conceivably
she
would
object
very
strongly
to
the
description
set
down
here
but
in
practical
fact
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
analysis
to
begin
with
this
conventional
and
charming
young
lady
of
park
lane
had
in
common
with
napoleon
bonaparte
that
christianity
meant
more
to
them
both
as
the
secret
of
social
order
than
as
the
mystery
of
the
incarnation
hilda
was
convinced
that
a
decent
and
orderly
life
rested
on
certain
agreements
and
conclusions
in
respect
to
marriage
and
class
and
conduct
and
that
these
agreements
and
conclusions
were
admirably
stated
in
the
book
of
common
prayer
and
most
ably
and
decorously
advocated
from
the
pulpit
of
john
she
would
have
said
that
she
believed
the
agreements
and
conclusions
because
of
the
prayer
book
but
in
fact
she
had
primarily
given
in
her
allegiance
to
a
social
system
and
supported
the
prayer
book
because
of
its
support
of
that
once
a
month
she
repeated
the
nicene
creed
but
only
because
in
the
nature
of
things
the
nicene
creed
was
given
her
once
a
month
to
repeat
and
she
never
really
conceived
that
people
might
worry
strenuously
about
it
any
more
than
she
did
being
an
intelligent
girl
she
knew
of
course
that
people
did
and
occasionally
preachers
occupied
the
pulpit
of
john
who
were
apparently
quite
anxious
that
she
and
the
rest
of
the
congregation
should
understand
that
it
meant
this
and
not
that
or
that
and
not
this
according
to
the
particular
enthusiasm
of
the
clergyman
of
the
moment
sentence
by
sentence
she
more
or
less
understood
what
these
gentlemen
keenly
urged
upon
her
as
a
whole
she
understood
nothing
she
was
far
too
much
the
child
of
her
environment
and
age
not
to
perceive
that
lloyd
george
experiments
in
class
legislation
were
vastly
more
important
peter
therefore
had
always
been
a
bit
of
an
enigma
to
her
as
a
rule
he
fitted
in
with
the
scheme
of
things
perfectly
well
for
he
was
a
gentleman
he
liked
nice
things
and
he
was
splendidly
keen
on
charity
organisation
and
the
reform
of
abuses
on
right
lines
but
now
and
again
he
said
and
did
things
which
perturbed
her
it
was
as
if
she
had
gradually
become
complete
mistress
of
a
house
and
then
had
suddenly
discovered
a
new
room
into
which
she
peeped
for
a
minute
before
it
was
lost
to
her
again
and
the
door
shut
it
was
no
bluebeard
chamber
into
which
she
looked
it
was
much
more
that
she
had
a
suspicion
that
the
room
contained
a
live
mistress
who
might
come
out
one
day
and
dispute
her
own
title
she
could
tell
how
peter
would
act
nine
times
out
of
ten
she
knew
by
instinct
a
great
deal
better
than
he
did
the
conceptions
that
ruled
his
life
but
now
and
again
he
would
hesitate
perplexedly
as
if
at
the
thought
of
something
that
she
did
not
understand
or
act
suddenly
in
response
to
an
overwhelming
flood
of
impulse
whose
spring
was
beyond
her
control
or
even
her
surmise
women
mother
all
their
men
because
men
are
on
the
whole
such
big
babies
but
from
a
generation
of
babies
is
born
occasionally
the
master
women
get
so
used
to
the
rule
that
they
forget
the
exception
when
he
comes
then
they
are
troubled
but
this
was
not
all
hilda
religion
for
some
mysterious
reason
this
product
of
a
highly
civilised
community
had
the
elemental
in
her
men
and
women
both
have
got
to
eliminate
all
trace
of
sex
before
they
can
altogether
escape
that
in
other
words
because
in
her
lay
latent
the
power
of
birth
in
which
moment
she
would
be
cloistered
alone
in
a
dark
and
silent
room
with
infinity
she
clung
unreasonably
and
all
but
unconsciously
to
certain
superstitions
which
she
shared
with
primitive
savages
and
all
of
which
seems
a
far
cry
from
the
war
intercession
services
at
wealthy
and
fashionable
john
but
it
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
this
which
was
causing
her
to
kneel
on
a
high
hassock
elbows
comfortably
on
the
and
her
face
in
her
hands
on
a
certain
friday
evening
in
the
week
after
peter
arrival
in
france
while
the
senior
curate
after
suitable
pauses
during
which
her
mind
was
uncontrollably
busy
with
an
infinite
number
of
things
ranging
from
the
doings
of
peter
in
france
to
the
increasing
difficulty
of
obtaining
silk
stockings
intoned
the
excellent
stately
english
of
the
prayers
set
forth
by
authority
in
time
of
war
two
pews
ahead
of
her
knelt
sir
robert
doyle
in
uniform
that
simple
soldier
was
a
bigger
child
than
most
men
and
was
therefore
still
conscious
of
a
number
of
unfathomable
things
about
him
for
the
which
hilda
his
godchild
adored
and
loved
him
as
a
mother
will
adore
her
child
who
sits
in
a
field
of
buttercups
and
sees
not
minted
nor
botanical
but
heavenly
gold
he
was
all
the
more
lovable
because
he
conceived
that
he
was
much
bigger
and
stronger
than
she
and
perfectly
capable
of
looking
after
her
in
that
he
was
like
a
plucky
boy
who
gets
up
from
his
buttercups
to
tell
his
mother
not
to
be
frightened
when
a
cow
comes
into
the
field
they
went
out
together
and
greeted
each
other
in
the
porch
child
said
the
soldier
with
a
smile
and
how
peter
hilda
smiled
back
but
after
a
rather
wintry
fashion
which
the
man
was
quick
to
note
i
could
have
told
you
fresh
news
yesterday
she
said
but
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
all
about
his
first
sunday
he
at
rouen
at
a
rest
camp
for
the
present
though
he
thinks
he
likely
to
be
moved
almost
at
once
and
he
quite
well
and
then
queried
the
other
affectionately
oh
he
does
know
at
all
but
he
says
he
does
think
there
any
chance
of
his
getting
up
the
line
he
be
sent
to
another
part
where
there
is
likely
to
be
a
shortage
of
chaplains
soon
well
that
all
right
is
it
he
in
no
danger
at
rouen
at
any
rate
if
we
go
on
as
we
going
on
now
they
wo
even
hear
the
guns
down
there
soon
come
little
girl
what
worrying
you
i
can
see
there
something
they
were
in
the
street
now
walking
towards
the
park
and
hilda
did
not
immediately
reply
then
she
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
ca
you
come
in
for
a
little
father
and
mother
will
be
out
till
late
and
you
can
keep
me
company
he
glanced
at
his
watch
i
got
to
be
at
the
war
office
later
he
said
but
my
man
does
reach
town
till
after
ten
so
i
will
the
club
not
these
days
what
with
the
men
who
think
one
knows
everything
and
wo
tell
and
the
men
who
think
they
know
everything
and
want
to
tell
it
a
bit
trying
hilda
laughed
merrily
poor
uncle
bob
she
said
giving
him
her
childhood
name
that
had
never
been
discontinued
between
them
you
shall
come
home
with
me
and
sit
in
father
chair
and
have
a
still
decent
whisky
and
a
cigar
and
if
you
very
good
i
read
you
part
of
peter
letter
what
would
peter
say
oh
he
would
mind
the
bits
i
read
to
you
indeed
i
think
like
it
he
like
to
know
what
you
think
you
see
he
awfully
depressed
he
feels
he
not
wanted
out
there
and
though
i
do
know
what
he
means
that
things
religious
things
you
know
are
real
not
wanted
eh
queried
the
old
soldier
now
i
wonder
why
he
resents
that
is
it
because
he
feels
snubbed
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
had
a
bit
of
a
swelled
head
your
young
man
you
know
hilda
sir
robert
doyle
if
you
going
to
be
beastly
you
can
go
to
your
horrid
old
club
and
i
only
hope
you
be
worried
to
death
of
course
it
is
that
besides
he
says
everyone
is
very
friendly
and
welcomes
him
only
he
feels
that
that
makes
it
worse
he
thinks
they
want
well
what
he
has
to
give
i
suppose
what
he
has
to
give
but
what
in
the
world
has
he
to
give
he
has
to
take
parade
services
and
visit
hospitals
and
he
was
just
going
to
say
bury
the
dead
but
thought
it
hardly
sounded
pleasant
make
himself
generally
decent
and
useful
i
suppose
that
what
chaplains
did
when
i
was
a
subaltern
and
jolly
decent
fellows
they
usually
were
well
i
know
that
what
i
should
feel
and
that
what
i
do
quite
understand
i
suppose
he
feels
he
responsible
for
making
the
men
religious
it
reads
like
that
but
you
shall
hear
the
letter
yourself
doyle
digested
this
for
a
while
in
silence
then
he
gave
a
sort
of
snort
which
is
inimitable
but
always
accompanied
his
outbursts
against
things
slightly
more
recent
than
the
sixties
it
had
the
effect
of
rousing
hilda
at
any
rate
do
you
dear
old
thing
she
said
clutching
his
arm
i
know
exactly
what
you
going
to
say
young
men
of
your
day
minded
their
business
and
did
their
duty
and
did
theorise
so
much
very
likely
but
you
see
our
young
men
had
the
misfortune
to
be
born
a
little
later
than
you
and
they
ca
help
it
she
sighed
a
little
it
trying
sometimes
but
they
all
right
really
and
they
come
back
to
things
they
were
at
the
gate
by
now
sir
robert
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
i
know
dear
he
said
i
an
old
fogey
besides
young
graham
has
good
stuff
in
him
i
always
said
so
but
if
he
on
the
tack
of
trying
to
stick
his
fingers
into
people
souls
he
made
a
mistake
in
going
to
france
i
know
tommy
or
i
did
know
him
the
lord
alone
knows
what
in
the
army
these
days
he
does
want
that
sort
of
thing
he
swears
and
he
grouses
and
he
drinks
but
he
respects
god
almighty
more
than
think
and
he
serves
his
queen
i
mean
his
king
a
parade
service
is
a
parade
and
it
a
bore
at
times
but
it
discipline
and
it
helps
in
the
end
like
that
little
it
helps
one
comes
away
one
can
stand
a
bit
more
for
the
sake
of
the
decent
clean
things
of
life
hilda
regarded
the
fine
straight
old
man
for
a
second
as
they
stood
on
the
top
of
the
steps
then
her
eyes
grew
a
little
misty
god
bless
you
uncle
bob
she
said
you
understand
and
the
two
went
in
together
hilda
opened
the
door
of
the
study
i
going
to
make
you
comfortable
myself
she
said
she
pulled
a
big
armchair
round
placed
a
on
a
small
table
and
drew
it
close
and
she
made
the
old
soldier
sit
in
the
chair
then
she
unlocked
a
little
cupboard
and
got
out
a
decanter
and
siphon
and
glass
and
a
box
of
cigars
she
placed
these
by
his
side
and
stood
back
quizzically
a
second
then
she
threw
a
big
leather
cushion
at
his
feet
and
walked
to
the
switches
turning
off
the
main
light
and
leaving
only
the
shaded
radiance
of
the
she
turned
the
shade
of
it
so
that
the
light
would
fall
on
the
letter
while
she
sat
on
the
cushion
and
then
she
bent
down
kissed
her
godfather
and
went
to
the
door
i
wo
be
a
moment
uncle
bob
she
said
help
yourself
and
get
comfortable
five
minutes
later
the
door
opened
and
she
came
in
as
she
moved
into
the
circle
of
light
the
man
felt
an
absurd
satisfaction
as
if
he
were
partly
responsible
for
the
dignified
figure
with
its
beautifully
waved
soft
fair
hair
of
which
he
was
so
proud
she
smiled
on
him
and
sat
down
at
his
feet
leaning
back
against
his
chair
and
placing
her
left
elbow
on
his
knees
he
laid
a
caressing
hand
on
her
arm
and
then
looked
steadily
in
front
of
him
lest
he
should
see
more
than
she
wished
hilda
rustled
the
sheets
the
first
is
all
about
me
she
explained
and
i
skip
that
let
me
see
yes
here
we
are
now
listen
rather
long
but
you
must
say
anything
till
i
finished
peter
letter
ran
i
gave
up
to
getting
ready
for
sunday
though
harold
he
the
of
the
camp
peter
says
a
jolly
decent
sort
of
man
me
to
go
up
town
with
him
i
had
had
a
talk
with
him
about
the
services
and
had
fixed
up
to
have
a
celebration
in
the
morning
in
the
in
camp
they
have
a
quiet
room
and
there
is
a
table
in
it
that
one
puts
against
the
wall
and
uses
for
an
altar
and
an
evening
service
in
the
part
of
the
place
i
could
have
a
morning
service
as
i
was
to
go
out
to
the
forest
camp
as
i
have
told
you
he
said
in
his
first
letter
how
he
had
been
motored
out
to
see
a
camp
in
the
forest
where
they
are
cutting
wood
for
something
and
he
had
fixed
up
a
parade
said
hilda
looking
up
doyle
nodded
gravely
and
she
went
on
reading
said
he
like
to
take
communion
and
that
i
could
put
up
a
notice
in
the
anteroom
of
the
officers
mess
i
spent
the
morning
preparing
sermons
i
thought
i
preach
from
the
axe
is
laid
to
the
root
of
the
tree
in
the
forest
and
make
a
sort
of
little
parable
out
of
it
for
the
men
i
planned
to
say
how
christ
was
really
watching
and
testing
each
one
of
us
especially
out
here
and
to
begin
by
talking
a
bit
about
germany
and
how
the
axe
was
being
laid
to
that
tree
because
it
would
bear
good
fruit
i
could
get
much
for
the
evening
so
i
thought
i
leave
it
and
perhaps
say
much
the
same
as
the
morning
only
differently
introduced
i
went
and
saw
the
hut
manager
a
very
decent
fellow
who
is
a
baptist
minister
at
home
and
he
said
like
to
come
in
the
morning
well
i
did
know
what
to
say
to
that
i
hated
to
hurt
him
and
of
course
he
has
no
baptist
chapel
out
here
but
i
did
know
what
the
regulations
might
be
and
excused
myself
on
those
grounds
in
the
afternoon
i
went
round
the
camp
oh
hilda
i
was
fearfully
nervous
i
do
know
why
exactly
but
i
was
the
men
were
playing
crown
and
anchor
and
sleeping
and
cleaning
kit
this
is
a
rest
camp
you
know
and
it
seemed
so
somehow
i
told
them
anyone
could
come
in
the
evening
if
he
wanted
to
but
that
in
the
morning
the
service
was
for
church
of
england
communicants
i
must
say
i
was
very
bucked
up
over
the
result
i
had
no
end
of
promises
and
those
who
were
going
to
be
out
in
the
evening
said
so
straight
out
quite
thirty
said
they
come
in
the
morning
and
they
were
very
respectful
and
decent
then
i
wrote
out
and
put
up
my
notices
the
mess
ragged
a
bit
about
it
but
quite
decently
here
the
padre
actually
going
to
do
a
bit
of
work
and
the
usual
i
shall
be
a
chaplain
in
the
next
war
and
i
mentioned
to
one
or
two
whom
i
knew
to
be
church
of
england
that
captain
harold
had
said
he
would
come
to
the
early
service
someone
had
told
me
that
if
the
of
a
camp
comes
the
others
often
will
after
dinner
we
settled
down
to
bridge
and
about
i
was
just
going
off
to
bed
when
harold
came
in
with
two
or
three
other
men
well
i
hate
to
tell
you
dear
but
i
promised
i
write
and
besides
i
do
want
to
talk
to
somebody
anyway
he
was
what
they
call
merry
and
he
and
his
friends
were
full
of
talk
about
what
they
done
up
town
i
do
know
that
it
was
anything
very
bad
but
it
was
awful
to
me
to
think
that
this
chap
was
going
to
communicate
next
day
i
did
know
what
to
do
but
i
could
say
anything
then
and
i
slipped
off
to
bed
as
soon
as
i
could
they
made
a
huge
row
in
the
anteroom
for
some
time
but
at
last
i
got
to
sleep
morning
i
was
up
early
and
got
things
fixed
up
nicely
at
eight
came
rather
sheepishly
a
young
chap
i
seen
the
day
before
and
i
waited
for
some
five
minutes
more
then
i
began
about
the
creed
harold
came
in
and
so
we
finished
the
service
neither
of
them
seemed
to
know
the
responses
at
all
and
i
do
think
i
have
ever
felt
more
miserable
however
i
had
done
all
i
could
do
and
i
let
it
go
at
that
i
comforted
myself
that
i
would
get
on
better
in
the
forest
where
i
thought
there
was
to
be
a
parade
got
out
about
eleven
and
i
went
to
the
hut
he
was
sitting
in
a
deck
chair
reading
a
novel
he
jumped
up
when
he
saw
me
and
was
full
of
apologies
he
absolutely
forgotten
i
was
coming
and
so
no
notice
had
been
given
and
anyway
apparently
it
is
the
custom
in
these
camps
to
have
ordered
parade
services
he
sent
for
the
who
said
the
men
were
mostly
cleaning
camp
but
he
thought
he
could
get
some
together
so
i
sat
and
talked
for
about
twenty
minutes
and
then
went
over
the
canteen
had
been
opened
and
there
were
about
twenty
men
there
they
all
looked
as
if
they
had
been
forced
in
except
one
who
turned
out
to
be
a
wesleyan
and
chose
the
hymns
out
of
the
books
in
the
place
they
had
mission
hymns
and
the
only
one
that
went
well
was
throw
out
the
which
is
really
a
rather
ghastly
thing
we
had
short
matins
and
i
preached
as
i
had
arranged
the
men
sat
stiffly
and
looked
at
me
i
do
know
why
but
i
could
work
up
any
enthusiasm
and
it
all
seemed
futile
afterwards
i
tried
to
talk
to
this
wesleyan
corporal
he
was
great
on
forming
a
choir
to
learn
hymns
and
then
i
said
straight
out
that
i
was
new
to
this
sort
of
work
and
i
hoped
what
i
had
said
was
all
right
he
said
yes
sir
very
nice
sure
but
if
you
excuse
me
what
the
men
need
is
converting
i
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
that
corporal
well
sir
he
said
they
want
to
be
led
to
put
their
trust
in
the
lord
and
get
right
with
god
there
many
a
rough
lad
in
this
camp
sir
if
you
knew
what
went
on
you
see
it
i
said
that
i
had
told
them
god
was
watching
them
and
that
we
had
to
ask
his
daily
help
to
live
clean
honest
lives
and
truly
repent
of
our
sins
yes
you
did
sir
he
said
that
what
i
say
sir
it
was
very
nice
only
somehow
these
chaps
have
heard
that
before
it
do
grip
sir
now
we
had
a
preacher
in
our
chapel
once
and
he
went
on
to
tell
me
of
some
revival
mission
i
went
back
to
the
he
wanted
me
to
have
a
drink
and
i
did
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
felt
like
it
then
i
got
back
to
camp
the
afternoon
i
went
round
the
lines
again
hilda
i
i
could
tell
you
what
i
felt
everyone
was
decent
enough
but
the
men
would
get
up
and
salute
as
i
came
up
and
by
the
very
sound
of
their
voices
you
could
tell
how
their
talk
changed
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
mind
you
they
were
much
more
friendly
than
men
at
home
but
i
felt
all
the
time
out
of
touch
they
did
want
me
and
somehow
christ
and
the
gospel
seemed
a
long
way
off
however
we
had
the
evening
service
the
hut
was
fairly
full
which
pleased
me
and
i
preached
a
much
more
gospel
address
than
in
the
morning
some
officers
came
and
then
afterwards
two
or
three
of
us
went
out
for
a
stroll
and
a
talk
these
officers
was
a
tall
chap
i
had
met
at
the
club
named
langton
he
had
come
down
to
see
somebody
in
our
mess
and
had
come
on
to
service
he
is
an
extraordinarily
nice
person
different
from
most
a
man
who
thinks
a
lot
and
controls
himself
he
did
most
of
the
talking
and
began
as
we
strolled
up
the
hill
padre
he
said
how
christ
save
us
said
he
had
died
to
obtain
our
forgiveness
from
god
and
that
if
we
trusted
in
him
he
would
forgive
and
help
us
to
live
nobler
and
manlier
lives
of
course
i
said
much
more
but
i
see
plainly
that
that
is
what
it
all
comes
to
i
had
done
he
walked
on
for
a
bit
in
silence
and
then
he
said
do
you
think
the
men
understand
that
said
i
thought
and
hoped
they
might
it
was
simple
enough
well
he
said
it
hopeless
jargon
to
me
if
i
try
to
analyse
it
i
am
knocked
out
right
and
left
by
countless
questions
but
leave
that
it
is
when
i
try
to
take
you
practically
at
your
word
that
i
find
you
are
mumbling
a
fetish
forgive
me
but
it
is
so
was
a
little
annoyed
and
very
troubled
do
explain
i
said
all
right
only
you
must
mind
if
i
hurt
you
he
said
take
in
well
that
either
means
that
a
man
gets
intoxicated
by
an
idea
which
does
control
his
life
just
as
it
would
if
he
were
intoxicated
by
the
idea
in
or
else
it
comes
to
nothing
i
really
trust
in
a
dead
man
or
a
man
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
god
what
tommy
wants
is
a
pal
to
lean
on
in
the
canteen
and
the
street
he
wants
somebody
more
real
and
more
lovable
and
more
desirable
than
the
girl
who
tempts
him
into
sin
and
he
ca
be
found
was
he
in
your
service
can
he
be
emotionally
conjured
up
by
not
to
temptation
or
to
be
a
daniel
be
honest
padre
the
thing
is
a
spectre
of
the
imagination
was
absolutely
silent
he
went
on
you
make
much
talk
of
sin
and
forgiveness
well
tommy
understand
what
you
mean
by
sin
he
is
confused
to
bits
about
it
but
the
main
thing
that
stands
out
is
that
a
man
may
break
all
the
ten
commandments
theologically
and
yet
be
a
rattling
good
pal
as
brave
as
a
lion
as
merry
as
a
cricket
and
the
life
and
soul
and
of
a
platoon
that
the
fact
and
it
is
the
one
thing
that
matters
but
there
is
another
thing
if
a
man
sins
how
is
he
to
get
forgiveness
what
sort
of
a
god
is
it
who
will
wipe
the
whole
blessed
thing
out
because
in
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
the
sinner
says
he
is
sorry
if
that
all
sin
is
it
is
worth
worrying
about
and
if
that
is
all
god
is
he
not
got
the
makings
of
a
decent
good
for
you
skipper
said
the
other
man
rounded
on
him
it
is
good
for
me
or
for
anyone
he
said
and
i
tell
you
what
my
boy
all
that
i
said
does
justify
a
man
making
a
beast
of
himself
which
is
what
the
majority
of
us
do
i
can
see
that
a
man
may
very
wisely
get
drunk
at
times
but
he
a
fool
to
get
himself
sodden
with
drink
and
he
went
on
to
more
hilda
that
i
ca
write
to
you
i
do
know
what
i
said
i
went
back
utterly
miserable
oh
hilda
i
think
i
never
ought
to
have
come
out
here
langton
right
in
a
way
we
clergy
have
said
the
same
thing
so
often
that
we
forget
how
it
strikes
a
practical
man
but
there
must
be
an
answer
somewhere
if
i
only
knew
it
meantime
i
like
a
doctor
among
the
dying
who
can
not
diagnose
the
disease
i
like
a
salesman
with
a
shop
full
of
goods
that
nobody
wants
because
they
do
fulfil
the
advertisement
and
i
never
felt
more
utterly
alone
in
my
life
men
talk
a
different
language
from
mine
they
belong
to
another
world
they
are
such
jolly
good
fellows
that
they
are
prepared
to
accept
me
as
a
comrade
without
question
but
as
for
my
message
i
might
as
well
be
trying
to
cure
smallpox
by
mouthing
sonorous
virgil
only
it
is
worse
than
that
for
they
no
longer
even
believe
that
the
diagnosis
is
what
i
say
and
what
gets
over
me
is
that
they
are
on
the
whole
decent
chaps
there
harold
he
probably
immoral
and
he
certainly
drinks
too
much
but
he
as
unselfish
as
possible
and
i
feel
in
my
bones
he
do
anything
to
help
a
friend
course
i
hate
their
vices
the
sights
in
the
streets
make
me
feel
positively
sick
i
would
touch
what
they
touch
with
a
stick
when
i
think
of
you
so
honest
and
upright
and
clean
oh
but
i
need
read
that
uncle
bob
she
turned
over
a
page
or
so
i
think
that
all
no
just
this
been
made
mess
secretary
and
i
serve
out
coffee
in
the
canteen
for
a
couple
of
hours
every
other
day
that
about
all
there
is
to
do
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
an
ordinary
commission
the
girl
voice
ceased
with
a
suspicious
suddenness
and
the
hand
tightened
on
her
arm
for
a
minute
they
remained
so
and
then
impulsively
and
unrestrained
she
and
sobbed
out
against
his
knees
oh
uncle
bob
i
so
unhappy
i
feel
so
sorry
for
him
and
and
the
worst
is
i
do
really
understand
i
do
see
what
worries
him
our
religion
is
good
enough
i
sure
oh
i
those
beasts
of
men
out
there
peter
too
good
for
them
i
wish
he
never
gone
i
feel
as
if
he
never
come
back
there
there
my
dear
said
the
old
soldier
uncomfortably
do
take
on
so
he
find
his
feet
you
know
it
not
so
bad
as
that
you
can
trust
him
ca
you
she
nodded
vigorously
but
what
do
think
of
it
all
she
demanded
sir
robert
doyle
cleared
his
throat
well
he
began
but
stopped
to
him
it
was
an
extraordinarily
hard
thing
to
speak
of
religion
partly
because
he
cherished
so
what
he
had
got
and
partly
because
he
had
never
formulated
it
probably
for
that
very
reason
sir
robert
could
hardly
have
told
his
maker
what
he
believed
about
him
when
he
said
the
creed
he
always
said
it
with
lowered
voice
and
bowed
head
as
one
who
considered
very
deeply
of
the
matter
but
in
fact
he
practically
never
considered
at
all
well
he
began
again
you
see
dear
it
a
strange
time
out
there
and
it
is
a
damned
unpleasant
age
if
you
excuse
me
people
ca
take
anything
these
days
without
asking
an
infernal
number
of
questions
some
blessed
socialist
begin
to
ask
why
a
man
should
love
his
mother
next
and
not
getting
a
scientific
answer
argue
that
one
should
as
for
the
men
they
all
right
or
they
used
to
be
the
brotherhood
fear
god
honour
the
king
that
about
enough
for
you
and
me
i
take
it
and
graham
find
it
enough
for
him
and
he
play
the
game
and
decent
men
will
like
him
and
get
er
helped
my
dear
that
all
there
is
to
it
but
it
a
pity
added
the
old
victorian
regular
that
these
blessed
labour
corps
and
rest
camps
and
all
the
rest
of
it
do
have
parade
services
the
boy
bound
to
miss
that
i
hanged
if
i
speak
about
it
and
that
reminds
me
good
lord
it
ten
i
must
go
he
started
up
hilda
rose
smiling
a
little
that
better
said
the
old
fellow
must
be
a
man
what
it
all
a
bit
of
the
war
you
know
oh
uncle
bob

a
dear

cheer
one
up
somehow
i
wish
men

more
like

you
do
my
dear

you
think

back
number
and

well
as

wo
have
you

me
a
kiss
and
say

mean

well

hilda

in
the
old
dog
yet
and
i
must
be
off
and
show
it
no
i
wo
have
another
not
before
duty
dear
and
do
worry
hilda
saw
him
off
and
waved
her
hand
from
the
door
then
she
went
back
slowly
to
the
study
and
looked
round
she
stood
a
few
moments
and
then
switched
off
the
lights
and
went
out
and
slowly
upstairs
the
maid
was
in
the
bedroom
and
she
dismissed
her
keeping
her
face
turned
away
in
front
of
her
glass
she
held
her
letter
irresolutely
a
moment
and
then
folded
it
and
slipped
it
into
a
drawer
she
lifted
a
photo
from
the
and
looked
at
it
for
a
few
minutes
earnestly
then
she
went
to
her
window
threw
it
up
and
leaned
on
the
sill
staring
hard
over
the
dark
and
empty
park
outside
the
general
walked
some
distance
before
he
found
a
taxi
he
walked
fast
for
a
man
of
his
age
and
ruminated
as
he
went
it
was
his
way
and
the
way
of
his
kind
most
of
the
modern
sciences
left
him
unmoved
and
although
he
would
vehemently
have
denied
it
he
was
the
most
illogical
of
men
he
held
fast
by
a
few
good
sound
principles
and
the
process
of
thought
to
him
meant
turning
over
a
new
thing
until
he
had
got
it
into
line
with
these
principles
it
was
an
excellent
method
as
far
as
it
went
and
it
made
him
what
he
was
a
thoroughly
sound
and
dependable
servant
of
the
state
in
any
routine
business
at
the
war
office
he
climbed
more
slowly
up
the
steps
and
into
the
lobby
an
officer
was
just
coming
out
and
they
recognised
each
other
under
the
shaded
lights
hullo
chichester
what
are
you
doing
here
demanded
doyle
heartily
thought
you
were
in
france

i
was
up

i
just
arrived

of

a
different
proposition
from
what
it
was
when
you
and
i
were
in
egypt
and
india
but
that
a
long
time
ago
old
friend
rouen
eh
now
that
a
coincidence
a
young
chap
i
know
has
just
gone
there
in
your
department
graham
peter
graham
remember
him
oh
quite
well
a
very
decent
chap
i
thought
joined
us
ten
days
ago
or
so
what
about
it
i
forget
for
the
moment
where
we
put
him
oh
nothing
nothing
he
find
his
feet
all
right
but
what
this
about
no
parade
services
these
days
no
parade
services
we
have
all
right
when
we
can
of
course
it
depends
a
bit
on
the
and
in
the
labour
corps
especially
it
usually
possible
it
is
like
the
line
old
fellow
and
even
the
line
is
what
we
knew
it
you
ca
have
parade
services
in
trenches
and
you
ca
have
them
much
when
the
men
are
bully
beef
or
mending
aeroplanes
and
that
sort
of
thing
this
war
a
big
proposition
and
it
got
to
go
on
why
young
graham
grousing
no
no
oh
no
hastily
asserted
doyle
the
soul
of
honour
no
not
at
all
only
mentioned
not
getting
a
parade
and
it
seemed
to
me
a
pity
there
a
lot
in
the
good
old
established
religion
is
there
said
the
other
thoughtfully
i
not
so
sure
the
men
do
like
being
ordered
to
pray
they
prefer
to
come
voluntarily
doyle
got
fierce
do
like
being
ordered
do
they
then
what
the
deuce
are
they
there
for
good
lord
man
the
army
is
a
debating
society
or
a
mothers
meeting
you
might
as
well
have
voluntary
games
at
a
public
school
the
smiled
that
it
old
headstrong
no
my
boy
the
army
a
mothers
meeting
at
any
rate
fritz
does
think
so
but
times
have
changed
and
in
some
ways
they
better
i
sooner
have
fifty
men
at
a
voluntary
service
than
two
hundred
on
a
parade
well
i
would
exploded
doyle
i
know
your
voluntary
services
moody
and
sankey
hymns
on
a
sunday
night
the
men
had
better
be
in
a
decent
bar
but
turn
out
in
the
morning
clean
and
decent
on
parade
and
give
the
old
service
and
it
tighten
up
and
do
good
voluntary
service
you
have
volunteer
evangelists
instead
of
army
chaplains
next
colonel
chichester
still
smiled
but
a
little
grimly
we
got
them
he
said
and
no
doubt
there
something
in
what
you
say
but
times
change
and
the
church
has
got
to
keep
abreast
of
the
times
but
look
here
i
must
go
what
about
a
luncheon
i
not
got
much
leave
so
must
i
i
an
appointment
said
doyle
but
all
right
old
friend
at
the
club
but
you
younger
than
i
chichester
or
perhaps
you
parsons
do
get
old
as
quickly
they
shook
hands
and
parted
sir
robert
was
busy
for
an
hour
and
came
out
again
with
his
head
full
of
the
proposed
plans
for
the
aerial
defence
of
london
taxi
sir
he
was
asked
at
the
door
no
he
replied
walk
home
best
way
to
think
walking
at
night
he
said
to
himself
as
he
turned
down
whitehall
through
the
all
but
empty
streets
darkened
as
they
were
the
meaning
of
those
great
familiar
spaces
struck
him
as
he
walked
hardly
formulating
it
he
became
aware
of
a
sense
of
pride
and
responsibility
as
he
passed
scene
after
scene
of
england
past
glory
the
old
abbey
towered
up
in
the
moonlight
solemn
and
still
but
almost
as
if
animate
and
looking
at
him
he
felt
small
and
old
as
he
passed
into
victoria
street
there
the
stores
by
night
made
him
smile
at
the
contrast
but
in
ashley
gardens
westminster
cathedral
made
him
frown
if
he
hated
anything
it
was
that
for
which
it
stood
romanism
meant
to
him
something
effeminate
sneaking
monstrous
that
there
should
be
englishmen
to
build
such
a
place
positively
angered
him
he
was
not
exactly
a
bigot
or
a
fanatic
he
would
not
have
repealed
the
emancipation
acts
and
he
would
have
said
that
if
anyone
wanted
to
be
a
romanist
he
had
better
be
one
but
he
would
not
have
had
time
for
anyone
who
did
so
want
and
if
he
should
have
had
to
have
by
any
chance
dealings
with
a
priest
he
would
have
been
so
frigidly
polite
that
the
poor
fellow
would
probably
have
been
frozen
solid
of
course
irishmen
were
different
and
he
had
known
some
capital
fellows
irish
priests
and
chaplains
and
then
he
saw
two
men
ahead
of
him
they
were
privates
on
leave
and
drunk
but
not
hopelessly
drunk
they
were
trying
to
negotiate
the
blank
of
the
entrance
to
the
catholic
soldiers
hut
in
the
protecting
wall
which
guarded
the
pavement
just
beyond
the
cathedral
as
sir
robert
came
within
earshot
one
of
them
stumbled
through
it
and
collapsed
profanely
he
halted
for
a
second
irresolutely
with
the
officer
hesitancy
at
meddling
with
a
drunken
man
the
fellow
on
the
ground
tried
to
raise
himself
and
got
one
elbow
on
the
gravel
this
brought
him
into
such
a
position
that
he
stared
straight
at
the
illuminated
crucifix
across
the
path
and
but
little
farther
in
lor
blimey
joe
he
said
i
blasted
drunk
i
am
thought
i
was
in
old
wipers
i
did
and
see
one
of
them
blessed
the
other
rather
less
away
pulled
at
his
arm
so
yer
did
ole
pal
he
said
it
there
now
this
some
cartholic
place
or
other
come
strike
me
dead
so
it
is
joe
large
as
life
christ
oo
thought
it
a
bloody
wat
old
england
comin
to
joe
and
with
drunken
solemnity
he
began
to
make
a
sign
of
the
cross
as
he
had
seen
it
done
in
belgium
the
other
in
the
plainly
started
shut
your
bloody
jaw
he
said
it
bad
luck
to
swear
near
a
cruchifix
i
saw
three
chaps
blotted
out
clean
next
second
for
it
back
behind
lar
basay
come
on
will
yer
we
car
stay
all
the
blasted
night
you
are
down
on
a
chap
you
are
said
the
other
do
mean
no
ought
to
know
that
he
got
unsteadily
to
his
feet
died
to
save
us
did
i
a
bloke
say
them
very
words
died
on
the
to
save
us
cheese
it
you
fool
we
have
somebody
out
next
come
away
with
yer
i
got
some
bass
in
my
place
if
we
git
there
at
this
the
other
consented
to
come
together
they
staggered
out
not
seeing
sir
robert
and
went
off
down
the
street
talking
as
they
went
the
general
stood
and
listened
as
the
man
voice
died
down
good
for
yer
old
pal
but
died
to
save
us
did
made
a
bloomer
of
it
i
reckon
did
save
us
from
the
bloody
trenches
not
as
i
can
see
if
that
chap
could
told
us
to
get
saved
from
the
blasted
rats
an
bugs
an
sir
robert
pulled
himself
together
and
walked
away
sharply
by
the
cathedral
the
carven
christ
hung
on
in
the
wan
yellow
light
very
still
chapter
v
peter
lay
on
a
bed
between
the
blankets
and
contemplated
the
ceiling
while
he
smoked
his
first
cigarette
he
had
been
a
fortnight
at
rouen
and
he
was
beginning
to
feel
an
old
soldier
that
is
to
say
he
was
learning
not
to
worry
too
much
about
outside
things
and
not
to
show
he
worried
particularly
about
the
interior
he
was
learning
to
stand
around
and
smoke
endless
cigarettes
to
stroll
in
to
breakfast
and
out
again
look
over
a
paper
sniff
the
air
write
a
letter
read
another
paper
wander
round
the
camp
talk
a
lot
of
rubbish
and
listen
to
more
and
so
do
a
morning
work
occasionally
he
took
a
service
but
his
real
job
was
as
mess
secretary
to
despatch
the
man
to
town
for
the
shopping
and
afterwards
go
and
settle
the
bills
just
at
present
he
was
wondering
sleepily
whether
to
continue
ordering
fish
from
the
big
merchants
biais
frères
et
cie
or
to
go
down
to
the
market
and
choose
it
for
himself
it
was
a
very
knotty
problem
because
solving
it
in
the
latter
way
meant
getting
up
at
once
and
his
batman
had
not
yet
brought
his
tea
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
tea
came
in
with
it
was
a
folded
note
came
last
night
sir
but
you
was
out
said
the
man
he
collected
his
master
tunic
and
boots
and
departed
peter
opened
the
note
and
swore
definitely
and
unclerically
when
he
had
read
it
it
was
from
some
unknown
person
who
signed
himself
as
acting
assistant
to
the
effect
that
he
was
to
be
moved
to
another
base
and
that
as
the
was
temporarily
on
leave
he
had
better
apply
to
the
colonel
of
his
own
group
for
the
necessary
movement
order
on
the
whole
this
was
unintelligible
to
peter
but
he
was
already
learning
that
there
was
no
need
to
worry
about
that
for
somebody
would
be
able
to
read
the
riddle
what
annoyed
him
was
the
fact
that
he
had
got
to
move
just
as
he
was
settling
down
it
was
certainly
a
matter
for
another
cigarette
and
as
he
lit
it
he
perceived
one
gleam
of
sunshine
he
need
worry
no
more
about
the
fish
peter
waited
till
harold
had
finished
his
breakfast
before
he
imparted
the
news
to
the
world
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
later
i
say
skipper
he
said
i
got
to
quit
what
padre
oh
hang
it
all
no
man
you
only
just
taken
on
the
mess
secretary
job
and
you
are
doing
it
any
too
badly
either
you
ca
go
old
dear
i
must
some
blighter
written
from
the
office
and
i
got
to
get
a
movement
order
from
the
colonel
of
the
group
whatever
that
means
but
i
suppose
you
can
put
me
straight
about
that
anyway
sure
thing
come
up
to
the
eleven
and
you
can
fill
up
the
chit
and
i
fire
it
in
for
you
it
only
a
matter
of
form
it
goes
through
to
colonel
lear
at
la
croisset
where
to
peter
told
him
moodily
eh
said
harold
well
you
can
cheer
up
about
that
havre
not
at
all
a
bad
place
there
are
some
decent
shows
about
there
and
some
very
decent
people
what
you
got
to
do
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
shall
find
out
when
i
get
there
but
i
care
what
it
like
it
vile
having
to
leave
just
now
when
i
getting
straight
and
what
you
do
for
a
four
at
bridge
harold
got
up
and
fumbled
in
his
pockets
as
usual
there
was
nothing
there
why
that
damned
batman
of
mine
wo
put
my
case
in
my
pocket
i
ca
think
he
said
i
have
to
fire
the
blighter
though
he
is
and
used
to
be
a
and
steward
give
me
a
fag
somebody
thanks
well
padre

use
grousing
it
a
beastly
old
war
and
you
in
the
blinkin
british
army
me
lad
drop
in
at
eleven
then
cheerio
till
then
at
eleven
peter
found
harold
signing
papers
he
glanced
up
oh
sergeant
he
said
give
captain
graham
a
movement
order
application
form
will
you
sit
down
padre
there
a
pen
there
peter
wrestled
with
the
form
which
looked
quite
pretty
when
it
was
done
harold
endorsed
it
fire
this
through
to
the
group
sergeant
he
said
and
rose
wearily
come
along
padre
he
said
got
to
go
round
the
camp
and
you
can
come
too
if
you
nothing
better
to
do
when
i
have
to
go
do
you
think
asked
peter
as
they
went
out
oh
i
do
know
in
a
day
or
two
you
have
to
hang
about
for
the
order
may
come
any
time
and
i
do
know
how
or
when
they
send
you
peter
did
hang
about
for
ten
days
with
his
kit
packed
his
recently
acquired
calm
forsook
him
about
the
sixth
day
and
on
the
tenth
he
was
entirely
mutinous
at
lunch
he
voiced
his
grievances
to
the
general
mess
look
here
you
men
he
said
i
fed
up
to
the
back
teeth
i
hung
round
this
blessed
camp
for
more
than
a
week
waiting
for
that
infernal
movement
order
and
i
hanged
if
i
going
to
stay
in
any
more
it
a
topping
afternoon
who
come
down
the
river
to
la
bouille
or
whatever
it
is
called
harold
volunteered
that
a
good
line
padre
i
want
to
go
there
myself
are
the
boats
running
now
saw
yesterday
volunteered
somebody
and
it
was
settled
the
two
of
them
spent
a
decent
afternoon
on
the
river
and
at
insistence
went
on
back
right
up
to
town
they
dined
and
went
to
a
cinema
and
got
back
to
camp
about
midnight
graham
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
the
board
in
the
anteroom
may
as
well
see
if
there
is
anything
for
me
he
said
there
was
of
course
he
tore
the
envelope
open
good
lord
skipper
he
said
here
my
blessed
movement
order
to
report
at
the
gare
du
vert
at
eight
this
very
day
i
only
four
hours
too
late
what
the
dickens
shall
i
do
harold
whistled
show
it
me
he
said
following
personnel
to
report
at
gare
du
vert
at
inst
he
read
you
for
it
old
bird
he
continued
cheerfully
but
what
rot
look
here
it
was
handed
in
to
my
at
you
have
hardly
had
time
to
get
there
at
any
rate
graham
looked
over
his
shoulder
that
so
he
said
but
what
i
do
now
have
a
notion
said
the
other
except
that
they
let
you
know
quick
enough
do
worry
that
the
main
thing
if
they
choke
you
off
tell
it
came
too
late
to
get
to
the
station
peter
meditated
this
in
silence
and
in
some
dismay
he
saw
visions
of
furious
strafing
and
unholy
terrors
he
was
to
be
forgiven
for
he
was
new
to
comic
opera
and
besides
when
a
page
of
falls
to
one
in
real
life
one
hardly
realises
it
till
too
late
but
it
was
plain
that
nothing
could
be
done
that
night
and
he
went
to
bed
with
what
consolation
he
could
derive
from
the
cheerful
harold
next
morning
his
breakfast
was
hardly
over
when
an
orderly
came
in
harold
had
been
earlier
than
usual
and
had
finished
and
gone
out
captain
graham
sir
queried
the
man
captain
harold
compliments
and
a
telephone
message
has
just
come
in
that
you
are
to
report
to
group
as
quickly
as
possible
peter
brushed
himself
up
and
outwardly
cheerful
but
inwardly
quaking
set
off
half
an
hour
walk
brought
him
to
the
place
a
little
office
near
a
wharf
in
a
tangle
of
trolley
lines
he
knocked
went
in
came
to
attention
and
saluted
colonel
lear
was
a
short
boorish
fellow
and
his
adjutant
sat
beside
him
at
the
desk
for
the
colonel
was
not
particularly
well
up
in
his
job
the
adjutant
was
tall
slightly
bald
and
and
he
leaned
back
throughout
the
interview
with
an
air
of
sneering
boredom
only
vouchsafing
laconic
replies
to
his
superior
occasional
questions
peter
did
know
which
he
hated
the
more
but
he
concluded
that
whereas
he
would
like
to
cut
the
colonel
in
regent
street
he
would
enjoy
shooting
the
adjutant
ah
said
the
colonel
are
you
captain
graham
well
sir
what
the
meaning
of
this
you
applied
for
a
movement
order
and
one
was
sent
you
and
you
did
not
report
at
the
station
you
damned
padres
think
you
can
do
any
bally
thing
you
choose
out
here
for
a
picnic
i
suppose
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
well
sir
said
peter
i
waited
ten
days
for
the
order
and
it
did
not
come
at
last
i
went
out
for
the
afternoon
and
got
back
too
late
to
execute
it
i
very
sorry
but
ca
i
go
instead
good
god
sir
do
you
think
the
whole
british
army
is
arranged
for
your
benefit
do
you
think
nobody
has
anything
else
to
do
except
to
arrange
things
to
suit
your
convenience
we
have
got
troopers
with
pullman
cars
every
day
for
the
advantage
of
you
chaplains
though
i
suppose
you
think
we
ought
to
have
supposing
you
did
have
to
wait
what
about
it
what
else
have
you
to
do
you
have
waited
fast
enough
if
it
was
an
order
to
go
on
leave
that
about
all
you
parsons
think
about
know
what
you
can
do
what
had
he
better
do
mallony
the
adjutant
leaned
forward
leisurely
surveying
peter
coolly
probably
he
better
report
to
the
sir
he
said
oh
very
well
it
wo
be
any
good
though
go
up
to
the
and
ask
him
what
you
can
do
here
the
order
he
threw
it
across
the
table
and
peter
picked
it
up
noting
miserably
the
blue
legend
failed
to
report
gare
du
vert
but
do
apply
to
this
office
again
have
you
got
a
blessed
department
to
do
your
own
damned
dirty
work
the
away
sir
said
peter
on
leave
i
suppose
wish
to
god
i
were
a
padre
eh
mallony
always
on
leave
or
in
paris
and
doin
nothing
in
between
got
those
returns
sergeant
what
in
hell
are
you
waiting
for
padre
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
peter
had
an
idea
of
what
seeing
red
really
means
but
he
mastered
it
by
an
effort
saluted
without
a
word
and
passed
out
in
a
confused
whirl
he
set
off
for
the
and
with
a
sinking
heart
reached
the
station
crowded
with
french
peasantry
who
had
apparently
come
for
the
day
to
wait
for
the
train
big
notices
made
it
impossible
to
miss
the
railway
transport
officer
he
passed
down
a
passage
and
into
an
office
he
loathed
and
hated
the
whole
wide
world
as
he
went
in
a
young
man
smoking
a
cigarette
and
reading
a
magazine
glanced
up
at
him
peter
observed
in
time
that
he
had
two
stars
only
on
his
before
he
could
speak
the
other
said
cheerily
well
padre
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
peter
deprecatingly
told
him
he
had
waited
ten
days
and
had
at
last
gone
out
and
the
movement
order
had
come
with
the
other
cut
him
short
oh
you
the
chap
who
failed
to
report
are
you
blighted
rotters
they
are
at
these
group
chuck
us
over
the
chit
peter
brightened
up
and
obeyed
the
other
read
it
i
know
ventured
peter
but
i
got
the
dickens
of
a
strafe
from
the
colonel
he
said
he
had
no
idea
when
i
could
get
away
and
had
better
see
you
what
can
i
do
silly
old
ass
you
better
go
there
are
plenty
of
trains
and
you
all
alone
are
you
i
might
just
alter
the
date
but
i
suppose
now
you
had
better
go
to
his
nibs
the
deputy
assistant
officer
controlling
transport
he
in
the
rue
de
la
republique
no
you
can
find
it
easily
enough
tell
him
i
sent
you
he
probably
make
you
out
a
new
order
peter
felt
enormously
relieved
he
relaxed
smiled
and
got
out
a
cigarette
offering
the
other
one
beastly
lot
of
fuss
they
make
over
nothing
these
chaps
he
said
i
know
said
the
but
they
paid
for
it
my
boy
and
probably
your
old
dear
had
been
strafed
himself
this
morning
well
cheerio
see
you
again
come
in
time
and
i
get
you
a
decent
place
the
great
man
office
was
up
two
flights
of
wooden
stairs
in
what
looked
like
a
deserted
house
but
peter
mounted
them
with
an
easy
mind
he
had
forgiven
lear
and
the
world
smiled
he
still
did
realise
he
was
acting
in
outside
a
suitably
labelled
door
he
stood
a
moment
listening
to
a
voice
drawling
out
sarcastic
orders
to
some
unfortunate
then
with
a
smile
he
entered
a
major
looked
up
at
him
and
heard
his
story
without
a
word
peter
got
less
buoyant
as
he
proceeded
and
towards
the
end
he
was
rather
lame
a
silence
followed
the
great
man
scrutinised
the
order
where
were
you
he
demanded
at
last
abruptly
it
was
an
awkward
question
peter
hedged
the
of
my
camp
asked
me
to
go
out
with
him
he
said
at
last
feebly
the
other
picked
up
a
blue
pencil
and
scrawled
further
on
the
order
we
had
too
much
of
this
lately
he
said
icily
officers
appear
to
think
they
can
travel
when
and
how
they
please
you
will
report
to
the
at
headquarters
echelon
he
handed
the
folded
order
back
and
the
miserable
peter
had
a
notion
that
he
meant
to
add
and
god
have
mercy
on
your
soul
he
ventured
a
futile
remonstrance
the
said
you
could
perhaps
alter
the
date
the
major
leaned
back
and
regarded
him
in
silence
as
a
remarkable
phenomenon
such
as
had
not
previously
come
his
way
then
he
sighed
and
picked
up
a
pen
he
said
peter
in
the
street
contemplated
many
things
including
suicide
if
colonel
chichester
had
been
in
rouen
he
would
have
gone
there
as
it
was
he
did
not
dare
to
face
that
unknown
any
more
than
this
other
in
the
end
he
set
out
slowly
for
was
saluted
by
the
sentry
under
the
flag
climbed
up
to
a
corridor
with
many
strangely
labelled
doors
and
finally
entered
the
right
one
to
find
himself
in
a
big
room
in
which
half
a
dozen
men
in
uniform
were
engaged
at
as
many
desks
with
orderlies
moving
between
them
a
kind
of
counter
barred
his
farther
passage
he
stood
at
it
forlornly
for
a
few
minutes
at
last
an
orderly
came
to
him
and
he
shortly
explained
his
presence
and
handed
in
the
order
the
man
listened
in
silence
asked
him
to
wait
a
moment
and
departed
peter
leaned
on
the
counter
and
tried
to
look
indifferent
with
a
detached
air
he
studied
the
kirschner
girls
on
the
walls
these
added
a
certain
air
to
the
otherwise
forlorn
place
but
when
a
little
later
were
installed
a
paternal
government
ordered
their
removal
but
that
then
mattered
no
longer
to
peter
at
the
last
the
orderly
came
back
will
you
please
follow
me
sir
he
said
peter
was
led
round
the
barrier
like
a
sheep
to
execution
and
in
at
a
small
door
he
espied
a
general
officer
at
a
desk
by
the
window
telephone
receiver
in
one
hand
the
fateful
order
in
the
other
he
saluted
the
other
nodded
peter
waited
ah
yes
speaking
that
group
headquarters
oh
yes
mallony
about
captain
graham
movement
order
when
was
this
order
applied
for
at
your
end
what
eighteenth
humph
what
time
did
your
office
receive
it
eh
ten
then
sir
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
was
doing
in
your
office
till
six
this
officer
did
not
receive
it
till
what
he
was
out
yes
very
likely
but
it
reached
his
mess
at
it
is
so
endorsed
colonel
lear
has
had
the
matter
under
consideration
good
kindly
ask
colonel
lear
to
come
to
the
telephone
he
leaned
back
and
glanced
up
at
graham
taking
him
in
with
a
grave
smile
i
understand
you
waited
ten
days
for
this
captain
graham
he
said
it
disgraceful
that
it
should
happen
i
am
glad
to
have
had
an
instance
brought
before
me
as
we
have
had
too
many
cases
of
this
sort
of
thing
lately
he
broke
off
yes
colonel
lear
ah
colonel
lear
this
case
of
the
movement
order
of
captain
graham
has
just
been
brought
to
me
this
officer
was
kept
waiting
ten
days
for
his
order
and
then
given
an
impossibly
short
time
to
report
well
it
wo
do
colonel
there
must
be
something
very
wrong
in
your
kindly
see
to
it
chaplains
have
other
things
to
do
than
sit
around
in
camps
waiting
the
convenience
of
group
headquarters
the
application
for
this
order
reached
us
on
the
and
was
sent
off
early
next
morning
in
ample
time
for
the
officer
to
travel
i
am
very
displeased
about
it
you
will
kindly
apply
at
once
for
a
fresh
order
and
see
that
it
is
in
captain
graham
hands
at
least
six
hours
before
he
must
report
that
is
all
peter
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
but
he
could
barely
keep
a
straight
face
either
the
hung
up
the
receiver
and
repeated
the
latter
part
of
the
message
peter
thanked
him
and
departed
walking
on
air
a
day
later
an
orderly
from
the
group
informed
him
at
that
the
order
had
been
applied
for
and
might
be
expected
that
day
and
at
he
received
it
such
is
the
humour
of
the
high
gods
who
control
the
british
army
but
he
never
saw
colonel
lear
again
and
was
thankful
peter
reached
his
new
base
then
early
in
march
in
a
drizzle
of
rain
he
was
told
his
camp
and
set
off
to
find
it
and
for
an
hour
walked
through
endless
docks
over
innumerable
bridges
several
of
which
being
open
to
admit
and
let
out
ships
caused
him
pretty
considerable
delay
it
was
a
strange
new
experience
the
docks
presented
types
of
nearly
every
conceivable
nationality
and
of
every
sort
of
shipping
french
marines
and
seamen
were
of
course
everywhere
but
so
were
chinese
south
african
natives
egyptians
senegalese
types
of
all
european
nationalities
a
few
of
the
first
clean
americans
in
uniforms
and
individual
officers
of
a
score
of
regiments
the
old
town
ended
in
a
row
of
high
houses
that
were
however
picturesque
enough
and
across
the
in
front
of
them
commenced
the
docks
one
walked
in
and
out
of
harbours
and
waterways
the
main
stretch
of
harbour
opening
up
more
and
more
on
the
right
hand
and
finally
showing
two
great
encircling
arms
that
nearly
met
and
the
grey
channel
beyond
tossing
at
anchor
outside
were
more
than
a
dozen
ships
waiting
for
dark
to
attempt
the
crossing
as
he
went
a
seaplane
came
humming
in
from
the
mists
circled
the
old
town
and
took
the
harbour
water
in
a
slither
of
foam
he
had
to
wait
while
a
big
argentine
ship
ploughed
slowly
in
up
a
narrow
channel
and
then
in
the
late
afternoon
crossed
a
narrow
swing
and
found
himself
on
the
main
outer
following
directions
he
turned
to
the
right
and
walked
as
if
going
out
to
the
harbour
mouth
a
mile
or
so
ahead
it
seemed
impossible
that
his
camp
should
be
here
for
on
the
one
hand
he
was
close
to
the
harbour
and
on
the
other
over
a
high
wall
and
some
buildings
was
plainly
to
be
espied
the
sea
a
few
hundred
yards
on
however
a
crowd
of
tommies
were
lined
up
and
passing
embarkation
officers
for
a
big
trooper
and
peter
concluded
that
this
was
the
leave
boat
by
which
he
was
to
mark
his
camp
across
the
road
and
more
or
less
beyond
it
he
crossed
a
went
in
at
a
gate
and
was
there
the
officers
quarters
had
a
certain
fascination
you
stepped
out
of
the
anteroom
and
found
yourself
on
a
raised
concrete
platform
at
the
back
of
which
washed
the
sea
very
extensive
harbour
works
half
completed
ran
farther
out
in
a
great
semicircle
across
a
wide
space
of
leaden
water
over
which
gulls
were
circling
and
crying
but
the
thin
black
line
of
this
wall
hardly
interrupted
one
sense
of
looking
straight
out
to
sea
and
its
wide
mouth
away
on
the
right
let
in
the
real
invigorating
wind
the
camp
itself
was
a
mere
strip
between
the
and
the
water
a
camp
of
to
which
he
was
attached
he
was
also
to
work
a
hospital
which
was
said
to
be
close
by
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
later
the
railway
ran
out
all
but
to
the
harbour
mouth
and
there
ended
in
a
great
covered
wide
station
above
it
large
and
airy
with
extensive
verandahs
parallel
to
the
harbour
was
the
old
customs
and
it
was
this
that
had
been
transformed
into
a
hospital
it
was
an
admirable
place
the
red
cross
trains
ran
in
below
and
the
men
could
be
quickly
swung
up
into
the
cool
clean
wards
above
these
all
on
one
level
had
great
glass
doors
giving
access
to
the
verandahs
and
from
the
verandahs
broad
gangways
could
be
placed
running
men
at
high
tide
on
to
the
hospital
ship
alongside
the
quarters
were
beyond
and
their
was
perched
up
as
it
were
sea
on
one
side
and
harbour
on
the
other
at
present
of
course
peter
did
not
know
all
this
he
was
merely
conducted
by
an
orderly
in
the
dusk
to
the
anteroom
of
the
mess
and
welcomed
by
the
who
led
him
into
a
comfortable
room
already
lit
in
a
corner
of
which
near
a
stove
four
officers
sat
at
cards
hearts
three
said
one
as
peter
came
in
pass
me
said
another
and
it
struck
peter
that
he
knew
the
tone
the
four
were
fairly
absorbed
in
their
game
but
the
orderly
officer
led
peter
towards
the
table
at
that
they
looked
up
and
next
minute
one
had
jumped
up
and
was
greeting
him
by
all
that
wonderful
it
you
again
he
said
donovan
exclaimed
peter
what
are
you
doing
here
the
south
african
held
out
his
hand
i
got
attached
to
one
of
our
nigger
outfits
he
said
just
up
the
dock
from
here
but
what
are
you
doing
oh
i
been
moved
from
rouen
said
peter
and
told
to
join
up
here
got
to
look
after
the
hospital
and
a
few
camps
and
i
was
told
he
added
i
live
in
this
camp
good
enough
said
donovan
let
me
introduce
you
this
is
lieutenant
pennell
lieutenant
pennell
captain
graham
this
is
a
bird
of
your
kidney
mess
secretary
and
a
great
man
padre
arnold
and
this
is
one
ferrars
australian
infantry
he
tried
to
stop
a
shell
went
on
donovan
easily
and
is
now
recovering
the
shock
left
him
a
little
insane
or
so
his
best
friends
think
hence
as
you
may
have
heard
he
has
just
gone
three
hearts
and
that
all
anyone
can
do
at
present
padre
so
have
a
cigarette
and
sit
down
i
hope
you
have
changed
your
old
habits
as
you
are
just
in
time
for
a
orderly
he
pulled
up
a
large
and
peter
subsided
into
it
with
a
pleasant
feeling
of
welcome
he
remembered
now
having
heard
that
donovan
was
at
havre
but
it
was
none
the
less
a
surprise
to
meet
him
donovan
played
a
good
hand
when
he
liked
but
when
he
was
not
meeting
his
mettle
or
perhaps
when
the
conditions
were
not
serious
enough
he
usually
kept
up
a
diverting
unorthodox
run
of
talk
the
whole
time
peter
listened
and
took
in
his
surroundings
lazily
come
on
said
his
friend
playing
a
queen
shove
on
your
king
pennell
everyone
knows
you
got
him
what
hiding
the
old
gentleman
are
you
why
sure
it
myself
has
him
all
the
time
gathering
up
the
trick
and
leading
the
king
perhaps
somebody
holding
up
the
ace
now
and
so
on
pennell
played
well
too
but
very
differently
he
was
usually
bored
with
his
luck
or
the
circumstances
and
until
you
got
to
know
him
you
were
inclined
to
think
he
was
bored
with
you
he
was
a
man
of
rather
an
engineer
in
who
had
knocked
about
the
world
a
good
deal
but
hardly
gave
you
that
impression
the
australian
played
poorly
with
curly
dark
hair
and
a
perpetual
pipe
his
face
was
almost
sullen
in
repose
but
it
lit
up
eagerly
enough
at
any
chance
excitement
arnold
was
easily
the
eldest
a
short
man
with
hair
and
very
kindly
eyes
a
man
master
of
himself
and
his
circumstances
peter
watched
him
eagerly
he
was
likely
to
see
a
good
deal
of
him
he
thought
and
he
was
glad
there
would
be
a
padre
as
well
in
camp
donovan
and
ferrars
won
the
game
and
so
the
rubber
easily
and
the
former
pushed
his
chair
back
from
the
table
that
enough
for
me
boys
he
said
i
must
trek
in
a
minute
well
padre
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
army
now
mixed
biscuits
rather
peter
said
but
i
had
a
rum
experience
getting
here
you
would
have
thought
it
possible
and
he
related
the
story
of
the
movement
order
at
the
close
pennell
nodded
gloomily
pack
of
fools
they
are
he
said

said

went
on
to
peter

added

padre

little
dinner

some
sort

ropes

peter
if
i
can
that
is
he
looked
inquiringly
at
arnold
oh

time

more
or
less

own
he
replied
at
least
it
is
our
side

the
house

padre
said
the
australian
getting
up
too

world

mean

or
principal
chaplain
department
church
of
england
or
nonconformist
and
it
sixpence
a
swear
in
this
mess
arnold
held
out
a
hand
donovan
caught
his
friend
by
the
arm
come
on
out
of
it
he
said

padre

so
long

arnold
for
my
sins
i
mess
secretary
and
as
the
president
out
and
likely
to
be
i
find
a
place
for
you
he
led
peter
into
the
passage
and
consulted
a
board
on
the
wall
like
to
put
you
next
me
but
i
ca
he
said
both
sides
occupied
wait
a
minute
no
pennell
and
no
free
how
would
you
like
that
pennell
he
called
through
the
open
door
what
the
next
room
to
yours
like
light
all
right
quite
decent
said
pennell
coming
to
the
door
going
to
put
him
there
padre
let
go
and
see
then
the
three
went
off
together
down
the
passage
the
little
room
was
bare
except
for
a
table
under
the
window
arnold
opened
it
and
peter
saw
he
looked
out
over
the
sea
pennell
switched
on
the
light
and
found
it
working
correctly
and
then
sauntered
across
the
couple
of
yards
or
so
of
the
cubicle
width
to
look
at
the
remains
of
some
coloured
pictures
pasted
on
the
wooden
partition
last
man
made
a
little
collection
from
vie
for
you
padre
he
said
not
a
very
bright
selection
either
you
have
to
cover
them
up
or
it
never
do
to
bring
your
or
or
whatever
he
is
in
here
what
a
life
he
added
regarding
them
they
are
a
queer
people
the
french
well
is
this
going
to
do
graham
glanced
at
arnold
very
well
he
said
if
it
all
right
for
me
to
have
it
quite
all
right
said
arnold
remember
pennell
is
next
door
left
so
keep
him
in
order
next
door
right
is
the
english
channel
more
or
less
now
what
about
your
traps
i
left
them
outside
the
said
peter
except
for
some
that
a
porter
was
to
bring
up
perhaps
they
be
here
by
now
i
got
a
stretcher
and
so
on
i
go
and
see
said
pennell
and
i
put
my
man
on
to
get
you
straight
as
you
have
a
batman
yet
and
he
strolled
off
come
to
my
room
a
minute
said
arnold
and
peter
followed
him
arnold
room
was
littered
with
stuff
the
table
was
spread
with
mess
accounts
and
the
corners
of
the
little
place
were
stacked
up
with
a
gramophone
footballs
and
the
chairs
were
both
littered
but
arnold
cleared
one
by
the
simple
expedient
of
piling
all
its
contents
on
the
other
and
motioned
his
visitor
to
sit
down
have
a
pipe
he
asked
holding
out
his
pouch
peter
thanked
him
filled
and
handed
it
back
then
lit
his
pipe
and
glanced
curiously
round
the
room
as
he
drew
on
it
you
pretty
full
up
he
said
fairly
said
the
other
there
a
here
and
i
run
it
more
or
less
and
tommy
likes
variety
he
a
fine
chap
tommy
do
you
think
so
peter
hesitated
a
second
and
the
other
glanced
at
him
shrewdly
perhaps
you
have
been
out
long
enough
he
said
perhaps
not
said
peter
not
but
what
i
do
like
him
he
a
cheerful
creature
for
all
his
grousing
and
has
sterling
good
stuff
in
him
but
religiously
i
do
get
on
far
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
awfully
worried
about
it
the
elder
man
nodded
i
guess
i
know
lad
he
said
see
here
presbyterian
and
i
reckon
you
are
anglican
but
i
expect
we
up
against
much
the
same
sort
of
thing
do
worry
too
much
do
your
job
and
talk
straight
and
the
men
listen
more
than
you
think
but
i
do
think
i
know
what
to
tell
them
said
peter
miserably
but
drawn
out
by
the
other
arnold
smiled
the
prayer
book
not
much
use
here
eh
but
forgive
me
i
do
mean
to
be
rude
i
know
what
you
mean
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
this
war
is
what
we
padres
have
been
needing
it
help
us
to
find
our
feet
only
this
is
honest
if
you
do
take
care
you
may
lose
them
i
have
to
keep
a
tight
hold
of
that
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
a
big
bible
to
mind
my
own
peter
did
not
reply
for
a
minute
he
could
not
talk
easily
to
a
stranger
but
at
last
he
said
yes
but
it
does
seem
to
me
to
fit
the
case
men
are
different
times
are
different
the
new
testament
people
took
certain
things
for
granted
and
even
if
they
disagreed
they
always
had
a
common
basis
with
the
apostles
men
out
here
seem
to
me
to
talk
a
different
language
you
do
know
where
to
begin
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
long
ago
ceased
to
believe
in
the
authority
of
anyone
or
anything
in
religion
and
now
they
actually
deny
our
very
commonplaces
but
i
do
know
how
to
put
it
he
added
lamely
arnold
puffed
silently
for
a
little
then
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
regarded
it
critically
god
in
the
soul
of
every
man
still
he
said
they
can
still
hear
him
speak
and
speak
there
and
so
must
we
too
graham
peter
said
nothing
in
a
minute
or
so
steps
sounded
in
the
passage
and
arnold
looked
up
quickly
maybe
he
said
our
ordinary
life
prevented
us
hearing
god
very
plainly
ourselves
graham
and
maybe
he
has
sent
us
here
for
that
purpose
i
hope
so
i
wondered
lately
if
we
have
come
to
the
kingdom
for
such
a
time
as
this
pennell
pushed
the
door
open
and
looked
in
you
there
graham
he
asked
oh
i
thought
i
find
him
here
padre
his
stuff
come
peter
got
up
excuse
me
arnold
he
said
i
must
shake
in
but
jolly
glad
you
said
what
you
did
and
i
hope
you
say
it
again
and
some
more
the
older
man
smiled
an
answer
and
the
door
closed
then
he
sighed
a
little
and
stretched
out
his
hand
again
for
the
bible
chapter
vi
the
great
central
ward
at
no
base
hospital
looked
as
gay
as
possible
in
the
centre
a
guard
band
sat
among
palms
and
ferns
and
an
extemporised
stage
draped
with
flags
was
behind
with
wings
constructed
of
material
pretty
well
all
round
were
the
beds
although
many
of
them
had
been
moved
up
into
a
central
position
and
there
was
a
space
for
chairs
and
forms
the
had
to
be
outside
the
ward
and
the
performers
therefore
came
and
went
in
the
public
gaze
but
it
was
not
a
critical
public
and
the
men
with
a
plenitude
of
cigarettes
did
not
object
to
pauses
on
the
whole
they
were
extraordinarily
quiet
and
passive
modern
science
has
made
the
battlefield
a
hell
but
it
has
also
made
the
base
hospital
something
approaching
a
paradise
there
were
women
in
plenty
the
staff
had
been
augmented
by
visitors
from
most
of
the
other
hospitals
in
the
town
and
there
was
a
fair
sprinkling
of
workers
and
so
on
in
addition
jack
donovan
and
peter
were
a
little
late
and
arrived
at
the
time
an
exceedingly
popular
subaltern
was
holding
the
stage
amid
roars
of
laughter
they
stood
outside
one
of
the
many
glass
doors
and
peered
in
once
inside
one
had
to
make
one
way
among
beds
and
chairs
and
the
nature
of
things
brought
one
into
rather
more
than
the
usual
share
of
scrutiny
but
nothing
could
abash
donovan
he
spotted
at
once
a
handsome
woman
in
nurse
indoor
staff
uniform
and
made
for
her
she
with
two
others
was
sitting
on
an
empty
bed
and
she
promptly
made
room
for
donovan
graham
was
introduced
and
a
quiet
girl
moved
up
a
bit
for
him
to
sit
down
but
there
was
not
much
room
and
the
girl
would
not
talk
so
that
he
sat
uncomfortably
and
looked
about
him
listening
with
one
ear
to
the
fire
of
chaff
on
his
right
donovan
was
irrepressible
his
laugh
and
voice
and
the
fact
that
he
was
talking
to
a
hospital
personage
attracted
a
certain
amount
of
attention
peter
tried
to
smile
but
he
felt
out
of
it
and
observed
he
stared
up
towards
the
band
which
was
just
striking
up
again
suddenly
he
became
conscious
as
one
will
that
someone
was
particularly
looking
at
him
he
glanced
back
over
the
chairs
and
met
a
pair
of
eyes
roguish
laughing
and
unquestionably
fixed
upon
him
the
moment
he
saw
them
their
owner
nodded
and
telegraphed
an
obvious
invitation
peter
glanced
at
donovan
he
had
not
apparently
seen
he
looked
back
the
eyes
called
him
again
he
felt
himself
getting
hot
for
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
a
kind
of
feeling
that
he
had
seen
those
eyes
before
he
was
perfectly
certain
he
did
not
know
the
girl
perhaps
she
had
made
a
mistake
he
turned
resolutely
to
his
companion
jolly
good
band
is
it
he
said
yes
she
replied
but
i
suppose
at
a
hospital
like
this
you
always
hearing
decent
music
he
ventured
not
so
often
she
said
this
band
is
just
back
from
touring
the
front
is
it
my
friend
said
something
to
that
effect
i
believe
so
she
said
peter
could
have
cursed
her
it
was
impossible
to
get
anything
out
of
her
though
why
he
had
not
a
notion
the
answer
was
really
simple
for
she
wanted
to
be
next
donovan
and
was
and
she
was
all
the
while
scheming
how
to
get
there
but
peter
did
not
tumble
to
that
he
felt
an
ass
and
very
uncomfortable
and
he
broke
into
open
revolt
he
looked
steadily
towards
the
chairs
the
back
of
the
girl
who
had
looked
at
him
was
towards
him
now
for
she
was
talking
sideways
to
somebody
but
he
noted
an
empty
chair
just
next
her
and
that
her
uniform
was
not
that
of
the
nurses
of
this
hospital
he
felt
confident
that
she
would
look
again
and
he
was
not
disappointed
instantly
he
made
up
his
mind
nodded
and
reached
for
his
cap
i
see
a
girl
i
know
over
there
he
said
to
his
neighbour
excuse
me
will
you
then
he
got
up
and
walked
boldly
over
to
the
vacant
chair
he
was
fast
acclimatising
to
war
conditions
he
sat
down
on
that
empty
chair
and
met
the
girl
eyes
fairly
she
was
entirely
at
her
ease
and
laughing
merrily
i
lost
my
bet
she
said
and
tommy
won
and
you
made
me
tell
a
thundering
lie
he
replied
laughing
too
which
you
know
is
the
first
step
towards
losing
one
soul
therefore
you
deserve
your
share
in
the
loss
why
what
did
you
say
she
demanded
i
said
i
saw
a
girl
i
knew
he
replied
but
i
have
any
idea
who
you
are
though
i
ca
help
feeling
i
seen
you
before
she
chuckled
with
amusement
and
turned
to
her
companion
he
remember
tommy
she
said
the
second
girl
looked
past
her
to
peter
i
should
think
not
she
said
nobody
would
but
he
probably
say
in
two
minutes
that
he
does
perfectly
shameless
julie
julie
swung
round
to
peter
you
a
beast
tommy
she
said
over
her
shoulder
and
i
sha
speak
to
you
again
you
see
she
went
on
to
peter
i
could
see
you
had
struck
a
footling
girl
and
as
i
do
know
a
single
decent
boy
here
i
thought
i
presume
on
an
acquaintance
and
see
if
it
was
a
lucky
one
we
got
to
know
each
other
you
know
the
girl
with
me
on
the
boat
oh
damn
i
told
you
and
i
am
swearing
and
you
a
parson
but
it
ca
be
helped
now
well
the
girl
told
me
we
should
meet
again
and
that
it
was
probably
you
who
was
mixed
up
with
my
what
do
you
think
of
that
peter
had
not
an
idea
really
he
was
going
through
the
most
amazing
set
of
sensations
he
felt
heavy
and
dull
and
as
if
he
were
utterly
at
a
loss
how
to
deal
with
a
female
of
so
obviously
and
totally
different
a
kind
from
any
he
had
met
before
but
with
it
all
he
was
very
conscious
of
being
glad
to
be
there
underneath
everything
too
he
felt
a
bit
of
a
which
was
a
delightful
experience
for
a
london
curate
and
still
deeper
much
more
mysteriously
and
almost
a
little
terrifyingly
something
stranger
still
that
he
had
known
this
girl
for
ages
although
he
had
not
seen
her
for
a
long
time
i
highly
privileged
i
sure
he
said
and
could
have
kicked
himself
for
a
stupid
ass
oh
lord
said
julie
with
a
mock
expression
of
horror
for
sake
do
talk
like
that
that
the
worst
of
a
parson
he
ca
forget
the
at
any
rate
i
not
sure
that
highly
fortunate
but
i
thought
i
ought
to
give
fate
a
chance
do
you
smoke
yes
said
peter
wonderingly
then
for
goodness
sake
smoke
and
you
feel
better
no
i
here
but
i
glad
you
are
educated
enough
to
ask
me
nurses
supposed
to
smoke
in
public
you
know
and
i
take
it
that
even
you
have
observed
that
i
a
nurse
she
was
quite
right
peter
drew
on
his
cigarette
and
felt
more
at
ease
well
to
be
absolutely
honest
i
had
he
said
and
i
observe
moreover
that
you
are
not
wearing
exactly
an
english
nurse
uniform
and
that
you
have
what
i
might
venture
to
call
a
zoological
badge
i
therefore
conclude
that
like
my
friend
donovan
you
hail
from
south
africa
what
hospital
are
you
in
quai
de
france
she
said
know
it
peter
repressed
a
start
quai
de
france
he
queried
where
that
now
at
this
moment
a
song
started
but
his
companion
dropped
her
voice
to
stage
whisper
and
replied
end
of
the
harbour
near
where
the
starts
know
it
now
he
nodded
but
was
saved
a
reply
she
looked
away
toward
the
platform
and
he
studied
her
face
surreptitiously
it
seemed
very
young
till
you
looked
closely
especially
at
the
eyes
and
then
you
perceived
something
lurking
there
she
was
or
he
concluded
she
looked
as
if
she
knew
the
world
inside
out
and
as
if
there
were
something
hidden
below
the
gaiety
peter
felt
curiously
and
intensely
attracted
his
shyness
vanished
he
had
and
had
had
no
intimations
of
the
doings
of
providence
and
nobody
could
possibly
be
more
sceptical
of
than
he
but
it
dawned
on
him
as
he
stared
at
her
that
he
would
fathom
that
look
somehow
somewhere
i
practically
not
made
up
at
all
she
whispered
without
turning
her
head
so
for
heaven
sake
do
say
there
too
much
powder
on
my
nose
peter
shook
silently
no
but
a
faint
trace
on
the
right
cheek
he
whispered
back
she
turned
then
and
looked
at
him
and
her
eyes
challenged
his
and
yet
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
hilda
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it
on
my
mother
sang
the
platform
a
shirt
without
a
gagged
peter
and
marvelled
at
himself
but
he
felt
that
her
smothered
laughter
amply
rewarded
him
the
song
ceased
in
time
and
the
encore
which
they
both
rigorously
demanded
and
immediately
she
began
again
i
hope
to
goodness
tea
is
far
off
she
said
by
the
way
have
to
take
me
to
it
now
you
know
we
go
out
of
that
door
and
up
a
flight
of
steps
and
there
the
matron
room
on
the
top
and
a
room
next
to
it
and
tea
be
there
it
will
be
a
fiendish
squash
and
i
would
go
if
i
had
you
to
get
me
tea
and
take
me
away
afterwards
as
soon
as
possible
i
highly
privileged
i
sure
said
peter
again
quite
deliberately
she
laughed
you
are
she
said
look
how
you
coming
on
ten
minutes
ago
you
were
a
bored
curate
and
now
you
what
are
you
peter
hesitated
perceptibly
he
felt
he
might
say
many
things
then
he
said
a
trapped
padre
and
they
both
laughed
thank
goodness
you
not
sentimental
anyway
she
said
nor
your
friend
but
the
matron
is
i
know
her
sort
look
at
them
peter
looked
donovan
appeared
still
entirely
at
his
ease
but
he
was
watching
peter
who
realised
why
he
had
been
made
to
look
he
brazened
it
out
smiled
back
at
him
and
turned
perfectly
deliberately
to
his
companion
julie
he
said
do
look
over
there
any
more
for
goodness
sake
or
we
have
donovan
here
and
if
he
comes
he
sail
in
and
take
you
to
tea
without
a
word
i
know
him
he
got
an
unfair
advantage
over
me
just
waking
up
and
he
been
awake
for
years
please
give
me
a
chance
she
leaned
back
and
regarded
him
humorously
you
not
doing
so
badly
she
said
i
do
know
that
a
man
has
ever
called
me
before
in
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
do
you
know
that
solomon
it
your
fault
i
never
been
introduced
and
i
must
call
you
something
so
why
not
the
name
your
friend
called
you
julie
very
pretty
and
suits
you
somehow
i
could
call
you
anything
though
it
may
be
convenient
to
know
the
rest
do
you
think
you
could
call
me
the
rev
peter
graham
i
could
she
confessed
slightly
more
solemnly
queer
is
it
but
do
talk
about
it
it
is
lucky
i
shall
call
you
solomon
for
ever
now
and
you
can
only
call
me
miss
gamelyn
when
you
got
to
see
but
why
in
the
world
it
does
fit
me
a
bit
oh
she
said
it
does
but
do
worry
why
perhaps
because
as
the
old
man
said
to
the
vicar
when
he
heard
of
solomon
wives
you
are
a
highly
privileged
christian
you
ca
deny
that
since
you
said
it
twice
praises
be
here
is
tea
come
on
come
on
tommy
oh
tommy
this
is
the
very
reverend
peter
graham
graham
this
is
one
raynard
commonly
known
as
tommy
my
so
try
to
be
polite
there
was
a
general
movement
and
peter
shook
hands
as
he
got
up
the
other
girl
struck
him
at
once
as
a
good
sort
you
booked
to
take
us
to
tea
i
suppose
she
said
julie
far
more
practical
than
you
imagine
padre
they
left
the
row
of
chairs
together
julie
well
in
front
and
apparently
forgetful
of
their
existence
as
they
came
abreast
of
the
empty
bed
peter
noticed
that
the
assistant
matron
had
gone
and
that
donovan
was
drifting
in
the
stream
alongside
her
in
front
but
before
they
were
out
of
the
great
ward
julie
and
he
were
laughing
together
peter
felt
absurdly
hurt
and
hated
himself
for
feeling
it
the
other
girl
was
talking
at
his
elbow
but
he
made
ridiculous
and
commonplace
replies
and
hardly
noticed
her
she
broke
off
at
last
abruptly
and
he
roused
himself
to
carry
on
he
caught
her
expression
and
somehow
or
other
it
landed
him
deeper
in
the
business
he
made
a
deliberate
move
where
are
you
going
after
this
he
asked
down
town
to
do
some
shopping
then
i
suppose
home
unless
a
fit
seizes
julie
and
we
run
a
risk
once
more
of
being
summarily
repatriated
he
laughed
does
that
often
happen
quite
often
you
see
ours
is
an
english
hospital
though
we
are
south
africans
attached
to
it
i
think
they
much
more
strict
than
colonial
hospitals
but
they
give
us
more
latitude
than
the
rest
at
any
rate
julie
had
a
fearful
row
once
and
simply
declared
she
would
do
some
things
and
since
then
they
turn
a
blind
eye
occasionally
but
there
are
limits
and
one
day
she
step
over
them
i
know
she
will
let
hope
not
said
peter
but
now
let
me
get
you
some
tea
the
little
room
was
packed
but
peter
got
through
somehow
and
made
his
way
to
a
series
of
tables
spread
with
cakes
and
sandwiches
he
got
a
cup
and
seized
a
plate
and
shouldered
his
way
back
in
the
crush
he
saw
only
the
top
of
miss
raynard
head
and
made
for
that
here
you
are
he
said
cheerfully
as
he
emerged
have
a
sandwich
thanks
she
said
as
she
took
it
but
why
did
you
bring
two
cups
why
he
asked
she
nodded
towards
a
corner
and
there
was
julie
wedged
in
between
people
and
refusing
tea
from
a
subaltern
she
expects
you
to
bring
it
said
miss
raynard
peter
looked
puzzled
where
donovan
he
said
i
thought
she
came
in
with
him
the
girl
smiled
she
did
but
she
arranged
for
you
to
bring
her
tea
whoever
donovan
is
and
she
wait
for
it
she
that
sort
besides
if
donovan
was
that
officer
with
the
matron
he
probably
got
other
fish
to
fry
peter
waited
for
no
more
but
plunged
into
the
press
again
as
he
emerged
he
crossed
the
track
of
his
friend
who
was
steering
about
with
cakes
hullo
padre
that
individual
said
you
a
smart
one
you
are
let
take
those
girls
out
to
dinner
they
come
all
right
peter
mumbled
something
and
went
on
with
his
tea
towards
the
corner
the
other
readiness
and
effrontery
staggered
him
but
he
was
going
to
give
himself
away
you
a
brute
said
julie
promptly
where
have
you
been
it
where
have
you
been
you
mean
retorted
peter
i
thought
i
was
to
take
you
in
to
tea
when
last
i
saw
you
you
had
donovan
in
tow
and
you
had
tommy
do
you
like
her
awfully
said
peter
i
think
she
wants
something
now
but
do
come
across
to
our
side
are
you
going
soon
yes
when
we
can
get
away
remember
everyone
is
watching
you
go
on
out
and
we
can
meet
you
below
right
said
peter
i
collect
donovan
he
found
him
after
a
bit
and
the
two
made
their
adieus
and
thanks
as
they
went
down
the
steps
jack
outlined
the
campaign
i
just
joked
to
her
about
dinner
he
said
but
i
think
they
rise
if
they
do
go
to
travalini
if
they
dare
that
girl
of
yours
is
up
to
anything
she
knows
a
thing
or
two
you
some
nerve
old
thing
nothing
to
yours
retorted
graham
still
not
at
all
sure
of
himself
but
look
here
what
about
travalini
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
go
there
oh
it
all
right
old
dear
you
have
a
vast
collar
on
now
and
you
ought
to
see
life
i
seen
scores
of
chaplains
there
even
old
arnold
i
look
after
your
morals
come
on
let
get
out
and
across
the
road
we
shall
see
them
coming
down
the
steps
the
hospital
fronted
on
to
the
sea
and
the
promenade
that
once
was
so
fashionable
the
sun
was
setting
blood
red
over
the
channel
the
ships
at
anchor
looking
dark
by
contrast
but
there
was
still
plenty
of
light
and
peter
was
inwardly
conscious
of
his
badges
still
he
told
himself
that
he
was
an
ass
and
the
two
of
them
sauntered
slowly
townwards
in
a
few
minutes
jack
glanced
back
they
coming
he
said
and
as
the
girls
crossed
on
to
the
pavement
behind
them
turned
round
good
for
you
he
said
you
got
out
quicker
than
i
thought
you
would
shall
we
tram
or
walk
walk
i
think
said
julie
it
topping
here
by
the
sea
i
want
to
get
a
pair
of
shoes
and
the
shop
not
too
far
besides
you
can
buy
shoes
by
artificial
light
which
wo
do
for
some
things
tommy
bought
a
hat
the
other
night
and
she
nearly
had
a
fit
in
the
morning
she
keeping
it
for
the
next
stunt
she
ran
on
and
despite
peter
donovan
annexed
her
they
set
off
gaily
ahead
julie
clear
laugh
coming
back
now
and
again
peter
felt
depressed
and
angry
he
told
himself
he
was
being
let
in
for
something
he
did
not
want
and
he
had
not
much
to
say
to
make
conversation
he
asked
about
south
africa
it
appeared
the
girls
came
from
natal
miss
raynard
was
enthusiastic
and
he
gathered
they
had
been
trained
together
in
pietermaritzburg
but
lived
somewhere
on
the
coast
where
there
was
tennis
all
the
year
and
moonlight
bathing
picnics
in
the
season
and
excellent
river
boating
he
could
not
catch
the
name
but
it
was
not
too
far
from
durban
he
said
in
the
end
that
he
had
always
wanted
to
visit
south
africa
and
should
certainly
come
to
natal
they
turned
off
the
promenade
into
a
boulevard
lined
with
the
usual
avenue
of
trees
it
was
dusk
now
and
looked
darker
by
contrast
with
the
street
lamps
small
rushed
by
now
and
again
with
clanging
bells
and
platforms
crowded
before
and
behind
and
there
were
plenty
of
people
in
the
street
julie
turned
abruptly
i
say
tommy
she
said
captain
donovan
wants
us
to
go
out
to
dinner
what
do
you
say
my
shoes
can
wait
and
we
need
be
in
till
it
not
more
than
six
now
it
will
be
a
spree
i
game
but
where
are
we
going
i
suggest
travalini
padre
said
donovan
not
for
me
said
miss
raynard
it
too
public
and
you
seem
to
forget
captain
donovan
that
we
are
forbidden
to
dine
with
officers
nobody
is
likely
to
give
us
away
tommy
said
miss
gamelyn
i
not
going
to
take
the
risk
in
uniform
let
go
to
a
quiet
hotel
or
else
to
some
very
french
place
that
would
be
fun
a
jolly
good
idea
cried
donovan
and
i
know
what
will
just
fix
us
up
come
on
tommy
smiled
probably
it
fix
us
up
tell
us
about
it
first
it
absolutely
safe
donovan
protested
it
quite
french
and
we
shall
get
one
knife
and
fork
each
there
a
cinema
on
top
and
billiards
underneath
and
practically
no
officers
go
a
belgian
captain
i
came
out
with
took
me
he
said
you
could
well
there
and
you
can
for
the
cooking
is
a
treat
i
swear
it
all
right
lead
on
said
julie
we
trust
you
and
she
manoeuvred
so
that
her
was
left
with
donovan
the
four
walked
briskly
through
the
dusk
do
you
love
france
in
the
evening
demanded
julie
yes
said
peter
but
dubiously
i
do
know
it
much
yet
he
added
oh
i
do
even
a
girl
can
almost
do
what
she
likes
out
here
i
had
some
awful
fun
in
havre
i
think
one
ought
to
take
one
pleasure
when
one
has
the
chance
do
you
but
some
of
these
girls
give
me
the
hump
they
so
narrow
they
ca
see
you
with
a
man
without
imagining
all
sorts
of
things
whereas
i
had
some
rattling
good
pals
among
men
out
here
then
they
so
afraid
of
doing
things
the
girls
i
mean
do
you
know
i
went
to
paris
when
i
came
up
here
from
boulogne
had
absolutely
time
of
course
nobody
knows
so
do
speak
of
it
except
tommy
of
course
how
did
you
do
it
demanded
peter
amused
well
you
see
i
and
another
girl
english
were
sent
over
by
boulogne
as
you
know
because
you
saw
us
on
the
boat
and
we
were
supposed
to
come
straight
here
in
the
train
we
met
a
canadian
in
the
french
air
service
and
he
put
us
wise
about
changing
and
so
on
but
it
appeared
you
have
to
change
at
amiens
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
he
said
the
thing
was
to
sleep
in
the
train
and
go
right
on
to
paris
then
you
got
hours
there
and
left
next
day
by
the
havre
express
the
girl
was
horribly
scared
but
i
said
we
try
it
nothing
happened
at
all
we
had
a
carriage
to
ourselves
and
merely
sat
still
at
amiens
when
we
got
to
paris
we
simply
walked
out
bold
as
brass
i
showed
our
tickets
at
havre
and
told
the
french
inspector
we
had
overslept
he
merely
told
us
the
time
to
leave
next
day
we
went
to
an
hotel
and
then
strolled
up
the
avenue
de
and
what
do
you
think
who
should
i
see
but
an
old
dear
of
a
general
i
knew
out
in
south
africa
who
is
in
the
french
red
cross
he
was
simply
delighted
to
see
us
he
motored
us
out
to
the
bois
in
the
afternoon
dined
us
and
took
us
to
the
theatre
only
by
jove
i
did
curse
that
other
girl
she
was
in
a
ferment
all
the
time
next
morning
he
had
a
job
on
but
he
sent
a
car
for
us
with
a
subaltern
to
put
us
on
the
train
and
we
went
to
the
this
time
he
could
do
enough
for
us
when
he
heard
the
name
of
general
de
villiers
and
saw
his
card
we
got
into
havre
at
midday
and
nobody
was
a
penny
the
wiser
peter
laughed
you
were
lucky
he
said
perhaps
you
always
are
no
i
not
she
said
but
i
usually
do
what
i
want
and
get
through
with
it
hullo
is
this
the
place
i
suppose
so
said
peter
now
for
it
look
as
if
you
been
going
to
such
places
all
your
life
i
probably
been
more
often
than
you
anyhow
solomon
said
julie
and
she
ran
lightly
up
the
steps
they
passed
through
into
a
larger
hall
brilliantly
lit
and
heavy
with
a
mixed
aroma
of
smoke
and
food
there
was
a
sort
of
hum
of
sound
going
on
all
the
time
and
peter
looked
round
wonderingly
he
perceived
immediately
that
there
was
an
atmosphere
about
this
french
restaurant
unlike
that
of
any
he
had
been
in
before
he
was
in
truth
utterly
bewildered
by
what
he
saw
but
he
made
an
effort
not
to
show
it
julie
on
the
other
hand
was
fairly
carried
away
they
seated
themselves
at
a
table
for
four
near
the
end
of
the
partition
and
she
led
the
party
in
gaiety
donovan
hardly
took
his
eyes
off
her
and
cut
in
with
dry
daring
remarks
with
a
natural
case
tommy
played
a
good
second
to
julie
and
if
she
had
had
any
fears
they
were
not
visible
now
what
about
an
appetiser
demanded
donovan
oh
rather
mixed
vermuth
for
me
but
tommy
must
have
a
very
small
one
she
gets
drunk
on
nothing
give
me
a
cigarette
now
padre
i
dying
to
smoke
peter
produced
his
case
do
call
him
here
said
donovan
you
spoil
his
enjoyment
a
cigarette
solomon
then
whispered
julie
as
the
other
turned
to
beckon
a
flashing
her
eyes
on
him
peter
resisted
no
longer
do
he
said
call
me
anything
but
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
something
inevitable
in
it
all
he
did
not
formulate
his
sensations
but
it
was
the
lure
of
the
contrast
that
won
him
ever
since
he
had
landed
in
france
he
had
as
it
were
hung
on
to
the
old
conventional
position
and
he
had
felt
increasingly
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
true
there
seemed
little
connection
between
a
dinner
with
a
couple
of
madcap
girls
in
a
french
restaurant
and
religion
but
there
was
one
he
had
felt
out
of
touch
with
men
and
life
and
now
a
new
phase
of
it
was
offered
him
he
reached
out
for
it
eagerly
julie
leaned
back
and
blew
out
a
thin
stream
of
smoke
her
eyes
daring
him
picking
up
the
little
glass
as
she
did
so
here
to
the
girl
with
the
little
grey
shoes
she
chanted
merrily
do
julie
for
heaven
sake
pleaded
tommy
he
be
shocked
oh
go
on
said
peter
what
is
it
captain
donovan
will
finish
laughed
julie
i
ca
for
i
do
know
it
he
said
let
have
it
little
girl
i
sure
it
a
sporting
toast
eats
your
grub
and
drinks
your
continued
she
shut
up
julie
said
tommy
leaning
over
as
if
to
snatch
her
glass
then
goes
home
to
her
mother
to
called
julie
breathlessly
leaning
back
do
ejaculated
donovan
julie
tipped
down
the
drink
you
knew
it
all
the
time
she
said
and
they
all
burst
out
laughing
peter
drank
and
called
for
another
his
eyes
on
julie
he
knew
that
he
could
not
sum
her
up
but
he
refused
to
believe
that
this
was
the
secret
behind
the
eyes
she
was
too
gay
too
insolent
what
donovan
thought
he
could
not
say
but
he
almost
hated
him
for
the
ease
with
which
he
kept
pace
with
their
companions
they
ordered
dinner
and
the
great
dish
of
was
brought
round
by
a
waiter
who
seemed
to
preside
over
it
with
a
fatherly
solicitude
julie
picked
up
an
olive
in
her
fingers
and
found
it
so
good
that
she
grumbled
at
only
having
taken
one
have
mine
said
donovan
shooting
one
on
to
her
plate
thanks
she
said
oh
heavens
i
forgot
that
patch
on
my
left
cheek
or
was
it
my
right
solomon
let
see
she
dived
into
her
pocket
and
produced
a
tiny
satin
beaded
box
it
chic
she
demanded
leaning
over
to
show
donovan
i
got
it
in
the
nouvelles
galeries
the
other
day
she
took
off
the
lid
which
revealed
its
reverse
as
a
tiny
mirror
and
scrutinised
herself
patting
back
a
stray
lock
on
her
forehead
oh
do
said
donovan
and
he
slipped
the
hair
out
again
with
his
finger
be
quiet
but
i
concede
that
this
wo
do
though
out
came
a
tiny
how
that
she
demanded
smiling
up
at
him
perfect
he
said
but
it
not
fair
to
do
that
here
wait
for
the
taxi
then
she
said
besides
it
wo
matter
so
much
then
what
wo
matter
demanded
peter
solomon
dear
you
as
innocent
as
a
babe
is
he
she
demanded
of
his
friend
donovan
looked
across
at
him
still
waters
run
deep
he
said
i
know
but
excuse
me
he
had
been
sitting
next
julie
and
opposite
miss
raynard
but
he
was
now
on
his
feet
and
begging
her
to
change
places
with
him
she
consented
laughing
and
did
so
but
julie
pretended
to
be
furious
i
wo
have
it
you
a
perfect
beast
tommy
captain
donovan
never
come
out
with
you
again
solomon
come
and
sit
here
and
you
tommy
go
over
there
peter
had
an
idea
why
but
he
too
got
up
tommy
protested
look
here
she
said
i
came
for
dinner
not
for
a
dance
oh
look
out
captain
graham
you
upset
the
cutlets
peter
avoided
the
waiter
by
an
effort
but
came
on
round
her
to
the
other
side
get
out
of
it
tommy
said
julie
leaning
over
and
pushing
her
i
will
have
a
man
beside
me
anyhow
i
sooner
be
opposite
said
donovan
i
can
see
you
better
and
you
ca
make
eyes
at
the
frenchman
at
the
other
table
quite
so
well
if
i
get
my
head
in
the
way
oh
but
he
such
a
dear
said
julie
i
love
to
flirt
with
him
only
i
must
say
his
hair
is
a
bit
greasy
you
make
his
lady
furious
if
you
do
take
care
said
donovan
and
it
a
shame
to
spoil
her
trade
peter
glanced
across
a
french
officer
sitting
opposite
a
painted
girl
was
smiling
at
them
he
looked
at
julie
she
was
smiling
back
julie
do
for
heaven
sake
said
her
we
shall
have
him
over
here
next
and
you
remember
once
before
how
awkward
it
was
julie
laughed
give
me
another
drink
then
captain
donovan
she
said
and
i
be
good
donovan
filled
up
her
glass
she
raised
it
and
challenged
him
to
we
two
in
she
began
miss
raynard
rose
determinedly
and
interrupted
her
come
on
she
said
that
a
bit
too
much
julie
we
must
go
or
we
never
get
back
and
do
forget
you
got
to
go
on
duty
in
the
morning
my
dear
she
pulled
out
a
little
watch
good
heavens
she
cried
do
you
know
the
time
it
now
we
ought
to
have
been
in
by
eight
and
is
the
latest
time
that

sake

once
agreed
good
lord

she
said
we
must
have
a
taxi

get
one

said
donovan

up
graham
will
you
while
i
shepherd
them
out
and
get
a
car
come
on
and
take
care
how
you
pass
the
frenchman
in
a
few
minutes
peter
joined
them
on
the
steps
outside
the
restaurant
was
in
the
corner
of
a
square
which
contained
a
small
public
garden
and
the
three
of
them
were
waiting
for
him
on
the
curb
a
taxi
stood
by
them
the
broad
streets
ran
away
to
left
and
right
gay
with
lights
and
and
the
dark
trees
stood
out
against
a
starry
sky
a
group
of
british
officers
went
laughing
by
and
one
of
them
recognised
donovan
and
hailed
him
two
spahis
crossed
out
of
the
shade
into
the
light
their
red
and
gold
a
picturesque
splash
of
colour
behind
them
glared
the
staring
pictures
of
the
cinema
show
on
a
great
hoarding
by
the
wall
come
on
graham
called
donovan
hop
in
the
four
packed
in
closely
peter
and
tommy
opposite
the
other
two
julie
farthest
from
peter
they
started
and
he
caught
her
profile
as
the
street
lights
shone
in
and
out
with
the
speed
of
their
passing
she
was
smoking
puffing
quickly
at
her
cigarette
and
hardly
silent
a
moment
it
been
a
perfect
treat
she
said
you
both
dears

they
tommy

must
come
and
have
tea

the
hospital

day

mine

way
solomon

peter
grinned
in
the
dark
and
told
her
oh

perfect
beast
she
said
then
you
knew
the
quai
de
france
all
the
time
well
you
jolly
near

she
exclaimed
suddenly

new
padre

peter

spree

in
on
duty

day
or

tommy

hear
that
solomon
our
spiritual
pastor
he
begun
well
has
he
peter
was
silent
it
jarred
him
horribly
but
just
then
the
car
slowed
down
what
up
now
demanded
donovan
only
the
sentry
at
the
swing
bridge
said
tommy
they
stop
all
cars

night

your
side
dear
give
him
the
glad
eye
the
door
opened
and
a
looked
in
hospital
corporal

all
right
said
julie
beaming
at
him
oh
all
right
miss
said
the
man
stepping
back
and
saluting
in
the
light
of
the
big
electric
standard
at
the
bridgehead
carry
on
driver
we
just
there
said
julie
i

car
solomon
somewhere
near
the
it
wo
do
to
drive
right
up
to
the
hospital
we
might
be
spotted
peter
leaned
out
of
the
window
on
his
side
the
lights
on
the
quay
glowed
steadily
across
the
dark
water
and
made
golden
flicking
streaks
upon
it
as
the
tide
swelled
slowly
in
in
the
distance
a
great
red
eye
flashed
in
and
out
solemnly
and
on
their
side
he
could
see
the
shaded
lights
of
the
hospital
ship
getting
ready
for
her
night
crossing
he
judged
it
was
time
and
told
the
man
to
stop
where
my
demanded
julie
i
believe
you
bagged
it
captain
donovan
no

the
girl
from

step

julie

to
get

do

still
tommy
a
rock
see
you
again
soon
she
leaned
forward
if
you
good
she
said
to
donovan
he
kissed
her
laughing
and
before
he
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
reached
over
to
peter
kissed
him
twice
on
the
lips
and
leaped
lightly
out
be
good
she
said
and
if
you
ca
be
careful
chapter
vii
following
a
delay
of
some
days
there
had
been
a
fairly
heavy
mail
and
peter
took
his
letters
to
the
little
terrace
by
the
sea
outside
the
mess
and
sat
in
the
sun
to
read
them
while
he
was
so
occupied
arnold
appeared
with
a
pipe
but
seeing
him
engaged
went
back
for
a
novel
and
a
it
was
all
very
peaceful
and
still
and
beyond
occasional
hammering
from
the
leisurely
construction
of
the
outer
harbour
wall
and
once
or
twice
the
siren
of
a
signalling
steamer
entering
the
docks
there
was
nothing
to
disturb
them
at
all
perhaps
half
an
hour
passed
then
peter
folded
up
some
sheets
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
walked
moodily
to
the
edge
of
the
concrete
staring
down
at
the
lazy
slushing
of
the
tide
against
the
wall
below
him
he
kicked
a
pebble
discontentedly
into
the
water
and
turned
to
look
at
arnold
the
older
man
was
stretched
out
in
his
chair
smoking
a
pipe
and
regarding
him
a
slow
smile
passed
between
them
no
hang
it
all
said
peter
there
nothing
to
smile
about
arnold
i
pretty
well
got
to
the
end
of
my
tether
meaning
what
exactly
queried
the
other
oh
well
you
know
enough
already
to
guess
the
rest
look
here
arnold
you
and
i
are
fairly
good
pals
now
i
just
like
to
tell
you
exactly
what
i
feel
sit
down
then
man
and
get
it
out
there
a
chair
yonder
and
got
the
forenoon
before
ye
i
a
heretic
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
but
perhaps
that
make
it
easier
i
take
it
it
a
kind
of
heretic
you
becoming
yourself
peter
pulled
up
a
chair
and
got
out
his
own
pipe
arnold
he
said
too
serious
to
joke
and
i
do
know
that
i
even
a
christian
heretic
i
do
know
what
i
am
and
where
i
stand
i
wish
i
did
i
wish
i
even
knew
how
much
i
disbelieved
for
then
i
know
what
to
do
but
it
not
that
my
dogmas
have
been
attacked
and
weakened
i
no
new
light
on
the
apostles
creed
and
no
fresh
doubts
about
it
i
could
still
argue
for
the
virgin
birth
of
christ
and
the
trinity
and
so
on
but
it
worse
than
that
i
feel
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
pulled
at
his
pipe
the
other
said
nothing
they
were
friends
enough
by
now
to
understand
each
other
in
a
little
while
the
younger
man
found
the
words
he
wanted
look
here
it
like
this
i
remember
once
on
the
east
coast
coming
across
a
stone
breakwater
high
and
dry
in
a
field
half
a
mile
from
the
sea
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
the
breakwater
and
it
served
admirably
for
certain
purposes
a
seat
for
instance
or
a
shady
place
for
a
picnic
but
it
was
no
longer
of
any
vital
use
in
the
world
for
the
sea
had
receded
and
left
it
there
now
that
just
what
i
feel
i
had
a
religion
i
suppose
it
had
its
weaknesses
and
its
faults
but
most
of
it
was
good
sound
stone
and
it
certainly
had
served
but
it
serves
no
longer
not
because
it
damaged
but
because
the
need
for
it
has
changed
its
nature
or
is
no
longer
there
he
trailed
off
into
silence
and
stopped
arnold
stirred
to
get
out
his
pouch
the
sea
is
shifty
though
he
said
if
they
keep
the
breakwater
in
decent
repair
it
come
in
handy
again
yes
burst
out
peter
but
of
course
that
where
illustrations
are
so
little
good
you
ca
press
them
and
in
any
case
no
engineer
worth
his
salt
would
sit
down
by
his
breakwater
and
smoke
a
pipe
till
the
sea
came
in
handy
again
his
job
is
to
go
after
it
true
for
ye
boy
but
if
the
old
plan
was
so
good
why
not
go
down
to
the
beach
and
get
on
with
building
operations
of
the
same
sort
arnold
said
peter
you
could
have
put
it
better
that
exactly
what
i
came
here
to
do
i
knew
in
london
that
the
sea
was
receding
to
some
extent
and
i
thought
that
there
was
a
jolly
good
chance
to
get
up
with
it
again
out
here
but
that
leads
straight
to
my
second
problem
i
ca
build
on
the
old
plan
and
it
does
seem
any
good
it
as
if
our
engineer
found
quicksands
that
would
hold
his
stone
and
that
smashed
up
all
his
piles
i
mean
i
thought
i
knew
what
would
save
souls
but
i
find
that
i
ca
because
my
methods
are
i
do
know
faulty
perhaps
out
of
date
maybe
possibly
worse
and
what
is
more
the
souls
do
want
my
saving
the
lord
knows
they
want
something
i
can
see
that
fast
enough
but
what
it
is
i
do
know
heavens
i
remember
preaching
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
from
the
text
had
compassion
on
the
multitude
well
i
do
feel
that
he
has
changed
and
i
quite
sure
he
still
has
compassion
but
the
multitude
does
want
it
i
was
wrong
about
the
crowd
it
nothing
like
what
i
imagined
the
crowd
is
interested
in
jesus
any
more
it
believe
in
him
it
a
different
sort
of
crowd
altogether
from
the
one
he
led
i
wonder
said
arnold
peter
moved
impatiently
well
i
do
see
how
you
can
he
said
do
you
think
tommy
worries
about
his
sins
are
the
men
in
our
mess
miserable
does
the
girl
the
good
books
talked
about
who
flirts
and
smokes
and
drinks
and
laughs
sit
down
by
night
on
the
edge
of
her
little
white
bed
and
feel
a
blank
in
her
life
does
she
arnold
i
blest
if
i
know
i
have
been
there
you
seem
to
know
a
precious
lot
about
it
he
added
dryly
oh
do
rag
and
do
be
facetious
if
you
do
i
shall
clear
trying
to
talk
sense
and
at
any
rate
it
what
i
feel
and
i
believe
you
know
i
right
too
peter
was
plainly
a
bit
annoyed
the
elder
padre
sat
up
straight
at
that
and
his
tone
changed
he
stared
thoughtfully
out
to
sea
and
did
not
smoke
but
he
did
not
speak
all
at
once
peter
glanced
at
him
and
then
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
waited
arnold
spoke
at
last
possibly
the
harbour
works
inspired
him
look
here
boy
he
said
let
get
back
to
your
illustration
which
is
no
such
a
bad
one
what
do
you
suppose
your
engineer
would
do
when
he
got
down
to
the
new
and
found
the
conditions
you
described
it
would
do
much
good
if
he
sat
down
and
cursed
the
blessed
sea
and
the
sands
and
the
currents
would
it
it
would
be
mighty
little
use
if
he
blamed
his
good
stone
and
sound
timber
useless
though
they
appeared
i
thinking
he
be
no
much
of
an
engineer
either
if
he
chucked
his
job
what
would
he
do
think
go
on
said
peter
interested
well
said
the
speaker
in
parables
unless
i
mighty
mistaken
get
down
first
to
studying
the
new
conditions
he
find
they
got
laws
governing
them
same
as
the
old
different
laws
maybe
but
things
you
could
perhaps
reckon
with
if
you
knew
them
and
when
he
knew
them
i
reckon
he
have
a
look
at
his
timber
and
stone
and
iron
and
get
out
plans
maybe
these
days
he
help
out
with
a
few
tons
of
reinforced
concrete
and
get
in
a
bit
o
work
with
some
high
explosive
i
no
saying
but
if
he
came
from
north
of
the
tweed
my
lad
he
added
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
a
touch
of
accent
i
should
be
verra
surprised
if
that
foreshore
had
a
breakwater
that
would
do
its
duty
in
none
so
long
a
while
and
if
he
came
from
south
of
the
tweed
and
found
himself
in
france
queried
peter
i
reckon
he
get
down
among
the
multitude
and
make
a
few
inquiries
said
arnold
more
gravely
i
reckon
he
would
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
and
he
would
believe
all
he
saw
and
heard
without
chewing
on
it
a
bit
as
our
yankee
friends
say
and
he
know
well
enough
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
his
master
and
no
change
in
his
compassion
only
maybe
that
he
had
perhaps
misunderstood
both
a
little
a
big
steamer
hooted
as
she
came
up
the
river
and
the
echoes
of
the
siren
died
out
slowly
among
the
houses
that
climbed
up
the
hill
behind
them
then
peter
put
his
hand
up
and
rested
his
head
upon
it
shading
his
face
that
difficult
and
dangerous
arnold
he
said
it
is
that
laddie
the
other
answered
quickly
there
was
a
time
when
i
would
have
thought
it
too
difficult
and
too
dangerous
for
a
boy
of
mine
but
i
had
a
lesson
or
two
to
learn
out
here
as
well
as
other
folks
up
the
line
men
have
learnt
not
to
hesitate
at
things
because
they
are
difficult
and
dangerous
and
i
tell
you
something
else
learnt
that
it
is
better
for
half
a
million
to
fail
in
the
trying
than
for
the
thing
not
to
be
tried
at
all
arnold
said
peter
what
about
yourself
do
you
mind
my
asking
do
you
feel
this
sort
of
thing
at
all
and
if
so
what
your
solution
the
padre
from
north
of
the
tweed
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
and
got
up
young
man
he
said
i
do
mind
your
asking
but
i
getting
old
and
my
answering
would
do
either
of
us
any
good
if
i
have
a
solution
i
do
suppose
it
would
be
yours
besides
a
man
ca
save
his
brother
and
not
even
a
father
can
save
his
son
i
nothing
to
tell
ye
except
maybe
this
do
fear
and
do
falter
and
wherever
you
get
to
remember
that
god
is
there
david
is
out
of
date
these
days
and
very
likely
it
was
david
at
all
but
i
do
know
anything
truer
in
the
auld
book
than
yon
verse
where
it
says
i
go
down
into
hell
thou
art
there
also
i
beg
your
pardon
padre
said
a
drawling
voice
behind
them
i
caught
a
word
just
now
which
i
understand
no
decent
clergyman
uses
except
in
the
pulpit
if
therefore
you
are
preaching
i
will
at
once
and
discreetly
withdraw
but
if
not
for
his
very
morals
sake
i
will
withdraw
your
congregation
that
is
if
he
has
forgotten
his
engagement
graham
jumped
up
good
heavens
pennell
he
exclaimed
i
blest
if
i
had
he
pushed
his
arm
out
and
glanced
at
his
watch
oh
plenty
of
time
anyway
i
lunching
with
this
blighter
down
town
padre
at
some
special
restaurant
of
his
he
explained
and
i
take
it
the
sum
and
substance
of
his
unseemly
remarks
are
that
he
thinks
we
ought
to
get
a
move
on
do
let
me
stand
in
the
way
of
your
youthful
pleasures
said
arnold
smiling
but
take
care
of
yourself
graham
eat
and
drink
for
you
die
but
do
eat
and
drink
too
much
in
case
you
live
to
the
day
after
i
remember
said
peter
but
i
hope
it
wo
be
necessary
however
you
never
know
the
multitude
do
you
he
added
arnold
caught
up
the
light
chair
and
lunged
out
at
him
ye
unseemly
creature
he
shouted
get
out
of
it
and
leave
me
in
peace
pennell
and
peter
left
the
camp
and
crossed
the
swing
bridge
into
the
maze
of
docks
threading
their
way
along
as
men
who
knew
it
thoroughly
they
came
at
length
to
the
main
roadway
with
its
small
rather
smelly
shops
its
narrow
almost
like
edinburgh
closes
and
its
succession
of
sheds
and
offices
between
which
one
glimpsed
the
water
just
here
the
war
had
made
a
difference
there
was
less
pleasure
traffic
up
seine
and
along
channel
though
the
southampton
packet
ran
as
regularly
as
if
no
submarine
had
ever
been
built
peter
liked
pennell
he
was
an
observant
creature
of
considerable
decencies
and
a
good
companion
he
professed
some
religion
and
although
it
was
neither
profound
nor
apparently
particularly
vital
it
helped
to
link
the
two
men
as
they
went
on
the
shops
grew
a
little
better
but
no
restaurant
was
visible
that
offered
much
expectation
where
in
the
world
are
you
taking
me
demanded
peter
i
do
mind
slums
in
the
way
of
business
but
i
prefer
not
to
go
to
lunch
in
them
wait
and
see
my
boy
returned
his
companion
and
do
protest
till
it
called
for
even
then
wait
a
bit
longer
and
your
sorrow
shall
be
turned
into
joy
and
that
scripture
great
scott
see
what
comes
of
fraternising
with
padres
so
saying
he
dived
in
to
the
right
down
a
dark
passage
into
which
the
amazed
peter
followed
him
he
had
already
opened
a
door
at
the
end
of
it
by
the
time
peter
got
there
and
was
halfway
up
a
flight
of
wood
stairs
that
curved
up
in
front
of
them
out
of
what
was
obviously
a
kitchen
a
huge
man
turned
his
head
as
peter
came
in
and
surveyed
him
silently
his
hands
dexterously
shaking
a
over
a
fire
as
he
did
so
bon
jour
monsieur
said
peter
politely
monsieur
grunted
but
not
unpleasantly
and
peter
gripped
the
banister
and
commenced
to
ascend
up
he
was
nearly
sent
flying
down
again
a
girl
short
and
dark
with
sparkling
eyes
had
thrust
herself
down
between
him
and
the
rail
from
a
little
landing
above
and
was
shouting
une
omelette
aux
champignons
jambon
pommes
sautes
vous
plait
peter
recovered
himself
and
smiled
bon
jour
mademoiselle
he
said
this
time
in
point
of
fact
he
could
say
very
little
else
bon
jour
monsieur
said
the
girl
and
something
else
that
he
could
not
catch
but
by
this
time
he
had
reached
the
top
in
time
to
witness
a
little
there
a
second
girl
taller
older
slower
but
equally
smiling
was
taking
pennell
cap
and
stick
and
gloves
making
play
with
her
eyes
the
while
merci
chérie
he
heard
his
friend
say
and
then
in
a
totally
different
voice
ah
bon
jour
marie
a
third
girl
was
before
them
in
her
presence
the
other
two
withdrew
she
was
tall
plain
shrewd
of
face
with
reddish
hair
but
she
smiled
even
as
the
others
it
was
little
more
than
a
glance
that
peter
got
for
she
called
an
order
at
which
the
first
girl
again
disappeared
down
the
stairs
greeted
pennell
replied
to
his
question
that
there
were
two
places
and
was
out
of
sight
again
in
the
room
seemingly
all
at
once
he
too
then
surrendered
cap
and
stick
and
followed
his
companion
in
there
were
no
more
than
four
tables
in
the
little
room
two
for
six
and
two
for
four
or
five
most
were
filled
but
he
and
pennell
secured
two
seats
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
opposite
a
couple
of
australian
officers
who
had
apparently
just
commenced
peter
was
by
the
window
and
he
glanced
out
to
see
the
sunlit
street
below
the
wide
sparkling
harbour
and
right
opposite
the
hospital
he
had
now
visited
several
times
and
his
own
camp
near
it
there
was
the
new
green
of
spring
shoots
in
the
snowy
linen
on
the
table
a
cheerful
hum
of
conversation
about
him
and
an
wall
behind
that
had
seen
the
revolution
pennell
he
said
you
a
marvel
the
place
is
perfect
by
the
time
they
had
finished
peter
was
feeling
warmed
and
friendly
the
australians
had
been
joined
to
their
company
and
the
four
spent
an
idle
afternoon
cheerfully
enough
there
was
nothing
in
strolling
through
the
busy
streets
joking
a
little
over
very
french
picture
quizzing
the
passing
girls
standing
in
a
queue
at
cox
and
finally
drawing
a
fiver
in
mixed
french
notes
or
in
wandering
through
a
huge
shop
of
many
departments
to
buy
some
toilet
necessities
but
it
was
good
fun
there
was
a
comradeship
a
youthfulness
carelessness
about
it
all
that
gripped
peter
he
let
himself
go
and
when
he
did
so
he
was
a
good
companion
one
little
incident
in
the
grand
magasin
completed
his
abandonment
to
the
day
and
the
hour
they
were
ostensibly
buying
a
but
at
the
moment
were
cheerily
wandering
through
the
department
devoted
to
the
attendant
girls
entirely
at
ease
were
trying
to
persuade
the
taller
of
the
two
australians
whom
his
friend
addressed
as
alex
to
buy
a
flimsy
lace
nightdress
for
his
fiancée
readily
pointing
out
that
he
would
find
no
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
it
elsewhere
if
he
had
not
got
such
a
desirable
possession
when
peter
heard
an
exclamation
behind
him
hullo
said
a
girl
voice
fancy
finding
you
here
he
turned
quickly
and
blushed
julie
laughed
merrily
caught
out
she
said
tell
me
what
you
buying
and
for
whom
a
blouse
a
camisole
or
worse
i
not
buying
said
peter
recovering
his
ease
we
just
strolling
round
and
that
girl
insists
that
my
friend
the
australian
yonder
should
buy
a
nightie
for
his
fiancée
he
says
he
has
one
so
she
is
persuading
him
that
he
can
easily
pick
one
up
what
do
you
think
she
glanced
over
at
the
little
group
easier
than
some
people
i
know
i
should
think
she
said
smiling
taking
in
his
six
feet
of
bronzed
manhood
but
it
no
use
your
buying
it
i
wear
pyjamas
silk
and
i
prefer
venns
i
remember
said
peter
by
the
way
i
coming
to
tea
again
that
will
make
three
times
this
week
she
said
but
i
suppose
you
will
go
round
the
ward
first
then
quickly
for
peter
looked
slightly
unhappy
next
week
i
a
whole
day
off
no
he
said
eagerly
oh
do
let
fix
something
up
will
you
come
out
somewhere
her
eyes
roved
across
to
pennell
who
was
bearing
down
upon
them
fix
it
up
she
said
bring
donovan
and
i
get
tommy
and
now
introduce
me
nicely
he
did
so
and
she
talked
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
went
off
to
join
some
friends
who
had
moved
on
to
another
department
by
jove
said
pennell
that
some
girl
i
see
now
why
you
are
so
keen
on
the
hospital
old
dear
wish
i
were
a
padre
i
shall
be
padre
in
began
alex
but
peter
cut
him
short
oh
lord
he
said
i
tired
of
that
come
on
out
of
it
and
let
get
a
refresher
somewhere
what
the
club
like
here
club
no
good
said
pennell
let
go
to
travalini
and
introduce
the
padre
he
not
been
there
yet
i
thought
everyone
knew
it
said
the
other
australian
rather
contemptuously
peter
thought
what
with
one
thing
and
another
he
felt
suddenly
that
he
like
to
go
he
remembered
how
nearly
he
had
gone
there
in
other
company
come
on
then
he
said
and
led
the
way
out
there
was
nothing
in
travalini
to
distinguish
it
from
many
other
such
places
indeed
to
distinguish
it
from
the
restaurant
in
which
peter
donovan
and
the
girls
had
dined
ten
days
or
so
before
except
that
it
was
bigger
more
garish
more
expensive
and
consequently
more
british
in
patronage
the
restaurant
was
however
separated
more
completely
from
the
in
which
among
palms
a
played
there
was
an
hotel
above
besides
and
that
helped
business
but
one
could
come
and
go
innocently
enough
for
all
that
there
was
anything
a
gentleman
wants
as
the
headwaiter
who
talked
english
called
himself
a
belgian
and
had
probably
migrated
from
over
the
rhine
said
everybody
indeed
visited
the
place
now
and
again
peter
and
his
friends
went
in
between
the
evergreen
shrubs
in
their
pots
and
through
the
great
glass
with
every
assurance
the
place
seemed
fairly
full
there
was
a
subdued
hum
of
talk
and
clink
of
glasses
waiters
hurried
to
and
fro
the
band
was
tuning
up
british
uniforms
predominated
but
there
were
many
foreign
officers
and
a
few
civilians
there
were
perhaps
a
couple
of
dozen
girls
scattered
about
the
place
besides
the
friends
found
a
corner
with
a
big
plush
couch
which
took
three
of
them
and
a
chair
for
alex
a
waiter
bustled
up
and
they
ordered
drinks
which
came
on
little
saucers
marked
with
the
price
peter
lay
back
luxuriously
said
the
other
australian
and
the
others
responded
that
good
said
pennell
not
so
many
girls
here
this
afternoon
remarked
alex
carelessly
see
dick
there
that
little
levantine
with
the
thick
dark
hair
caught
somebody
peter
looked
across
in
the
direction
indicated
the
girl
in
a
cerise
costume
with
a
big
black
hat
short
skirt
and
dainty
bag
was
sitting
in
a
chair
halfway
on
to
them
and
leaning
over
the
table
before
her
as
he
watched
she
threw
her
head
back
and
laughed
softly
he
caught
the
gleam
of
a
white
throat
and
of
dark
sloe
eyes
she
a
pretty
one
said
pennell
god
but
they
queer
little
bits
of
fluff
these
girls
it
beats
me
how
they
always
gay
and
always
easy
to
get
and
to
leave
and
they
get
rottenly
treated
sometimes
yes
i
damned
if
i
understand
them
said
alex
now
padre
i
tell
you
something
that
more
in
your
way
than
mine
and
you
can
see
what
you
make
of
it
i
was
in
a
maison
tolerée
the
other
day
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
and
there
were
half
a
dozen
of
us
in
the
with
the
girls
drinking
fizz
i
had
a
little
bit
of
a
thing
with
fair
hair
she
could
have
been
more
than
seventeen
at
most
i
reckon
with
a
laugh
that
did
you
good
to
hear
and
by
gum
we
wanted
to
be
cheered
just
then
for
we
had
had
a
bit
of
a
gruelling
on
the
ancre
and
had
been
pulled
out
of
the
line
to
refit
she
sat
there
with
an
angel
face
a
chemise
transparent
except
where
it
was
embroidered
and
not
much
else
and
some
of
the
women
were
fair
beasts
well
she
moved
on
my
knee
and
i
spilt
some
champagne
and
swore
christ
i
said
do
you
know
she
pushed
back
from
me
as
if
i
had
hit
her
do
say
his
name
she
said
me
you
wo
say
it
again
do
you
not
know
how
he
loved
us
i
was
so
taken
aback
that
i
promised
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
padre
i
have
said
it
since
what
do
you
think
of
that
peter
shook
his
head
and
drained
his
glass
he
could
have
spoken
at
once
the
little
story
told
in
such
a
place
struck
him
so
much
then
he
asked
but
is
that
all
how
did
she
come
to
be
there
well
alex
said
that
just
as
strange
father
was
in
a
french
cavalry
regiment
and
got
knocked
out
on
the
marne
they
lived
in
arras
before
the
war
and
you
can
guess
that
there
was
much
left
of
the
home
one
much
older
sister
was
a
widow
with
a
big
family
the
other
was
a
kid
of
ten
or
eleven
so
this
one
went
into
the
business
to
keep
the
family
going
fact
the
mother
used
to
come
and
see
her
and
i
got
to
know
her
she
did
seem
to
mind
said
the
doctors
looked
after
them
well
and
the
girl
was
making
good
money
hullo
he
broke
off
louise
and
to
peter
horror
he
and
smiled
across
at
a
girl
some
few
tables
away
she
got
up
and
came
over
beamed
on
them
all
and
took
the
seat
alex
vacated
she
said
in
fair
english
scrutinising
them
what
is
it
you
say
things
alex
pressed
a
drink
on
her
and
beckoned
the
waiter
she
took
a
syrup
the
rest
martinis
peter
sipped
his
and
watched
her
talking
to
alex
and
pennell
the
other
australian
got
up
and
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
with
some
other
men
the
stories
he
had
heard
moved
him
profoundly
he
wondered
if
they
were
true
but
he
seemed
to
see
confirmation
in
the
girl
before
him
despite
some
making
up
it
was
a
clean
face
if
one
could
say
so
she
was
laughing
and
talking
with
all
the
ease
in
the
world
though
peter
noticed
that
her
eyes
kept
straying
round
the
room
apparently
his
friends
had
all
her
attention
but
he
could
see
it
was
not
so
she
was
on
the
watch
for
clients
old
or
new
he
thought
how
such
a
girl
would
have
disgusted
him
a
few
short
weeks
ago
but
he
did
not
feel
disgusted
now
he
could
not
he
did
not
know
what
he
felt
he
wondered
as
he
looked
if
she
were
one
of
the
multitude
and
then
the
fragment
of
a
text
slipped
through
his
brain
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
friend
the
little
adjective
struck
him
as
never
before
had
they
ever
had
another
he
frowned
to
himself
at
the
thought
and
could
not
help
wondering
vaguely
what
his
vicar
or
the
canon
would
have
done
in
travalini
then
he
wondered
instantly
what
that
other
would
have
done
and
he
found
no
answer
at
all
yes
but
i
do
not
know
your
friend
yet
he
heard
the
girl
say
and
saw
she
was
being
introduced
to
pennell
she
held
out
a
decently
gloved
hand
with
a
gesture
that
startled
him
it
was
so
like
hilda
hilda
the
comparison
dazed
him
he
fancied
he
could
see
her
utter
disgust
and
then
he
involuntarily
shook
his
head
it
would
be
too
great
for
him
to
imagine
what
would
she
have
made
of
the
story
he
had
just
heard
he
concluded
she
would
flatly
disbelieve
it
but
julie
he
smiled
to
himself
and
then
for
the
first
time
suddenly
asked
himself
what
he
really
felt
towards
julie
he
remembered
that
first
night
and
the
kiss
and
how
he
had
half
hated
it
half
liked
it
he
felt
now
chiefly
anger
that
donovan
had
had
one
too
one
but
he
peter
had
had
two
then
he
called
himself
a
damned
fool
it
was
all
of
a
piece
with
her
extravagant
and
utterly
unconventional
madness
but
what
then
would
she
say
to
this
had
she
anything
in
common
with
it
he
played
with
that
awhile
blowing
out
thoughtful
rings
of
smoke
it
struck
him
that
she
had
but
he
was
fully
aware
that
that
did
not
disgust
him
in
the
least
it
almost
fascinated
him
just
as
that
it
hilda
disgust
would
repel
him
why
he
had
an
idea
monsieur
le
capitaine
is
very
dull
said
a
girl
voice
at
his
elbow
he
started
louise
had
moved
to
the
sofa
and
was
smiling
at
him
he
glanced
towards
his
companions
alex
was
standing
finishing
a
last
drink
pennell
staring
at
louise
he
looked
back
at
the
girl
straight
into
her
eyes
and
could
not
read
them
in
the
least
the
darkened
eyebrows
and
the
glitter
in
them
baffled
him
but
he
must
speak
am
i
he
said
forgive
me
mademoiselle
i
was
thinking
of
your
fiancée
is
it
not
so
ah
the
capitaine
has
his
fiancée
then
in
england
ah
well
the
girls
in
england
do
not
suffer
like
we
girls
in
france
they
are
proud
too
the
english
misses
i
know
for
i
have
been
there
to
how
do
you
call
it
folkestone
they
walk
with
the
head
in
the
air
and
she
tilted
up
her
chin
so
comically
that
peter
smiled
involuntarily
no
i
do
not
like
them
went
on
the
girl
deliberately
they
are
only
half
alive
i
think
i
almost
wish
the
boche
had
been
in
your
land
they
are
cold
la
and
not
so
very
nice
to
kiss
eh
they
not
all
like
that
said
pennell
ah
non
but
you
like
the
girls
of
france
the
best
mon
ami
is
it
not
so
she
leaned
across
towards
him
significantly
pennell
laughed
yes
perhaps
he
said
deliberately
but
after
the
war
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
like
a
frenchman
a
shade
passed
over
the
girl
face
and
she
got
up
it
is
so
she
said
lightly
monsieur
speaks
very
true
oh
very
true
the
girls
of
france
now
they
are
gay
they
are
alive
they
smile
and
it
is
war
and
you
men
want
these
things
but
after
oh
i
know
you
english
you
go
home
and
be
how
do
you
say
and
marry
an
english
miss
and
have
oh
many
many
bébés
and
wear
the
and
go
to
church
there
is
no
country
like
england
she
made
a
little
gesture
what
do
you
believe
you
english
in
le
bon
dieu
non
in
love
ah
non
in
what
then
je
ne
sais
she
laughed
again
what
i
said
forgive
me
monsieur
and
you
also
monsieur
le
capitaine
but
i
do
see
a
friend
of
mine
see
i
go
bon
soir
she
looked
deliberately
at
peter
a
moment
then
smiled
comprehensively
and
left
them
peter
saw
that
alex
had
gone
already
he
asked
no
questions
but
looked
at
pennell
inquiringly
i
think
so
padre
i
had
enough
of
it
let
clear
we
can
get
back
in
time
for
mess
they
went
out
into
the
darkening
streets
crossed
an
open
square
and
turned
down
a
busy
road
to
the
docks
they
walked
quickly
but
peter
seemed
to
himself
conscious
of
everyone
that
passed
he
scanned
faces
as
if
to
read
a
riddle
in
them
there
were
men
who
lounged
by
gay
reckless
out
for
fun
plainly
but
without
any
other
sinister
thought
apparently
there
were
tommies
who
saluted
and
trudged
on
heavily
there
were
a
couple
of
yorkshire
boys
who
did
not
notice
them
flushed
animal
making
determinedly
for
a
destination
down
the
street
there
was
one
man
at
least
who
passed
walking
alone
with
a
tense
greedy
hard
face
and
peter
all
but
shuddered
the
lit
shops
gave
way
to
a
railed
space
dark
by
contrast
and
a
tall
building
of
old
blackened
stone
here
and
there
chipped
white
loomed
up
moved
by
an
impulse
peter
paused
let
see
if
it
open
pennell
he
said
do
you
mind
i
wo
be
a
second
not
a
scrap
old
man
said
pennell
i
come
in
too
peter
walked
up
to
a
padded
door
and
pushed
it
swung
open
they
stepped
in
into
a
faintly
broken
silence
and
stood
still
objects
loomed
up
indistinctly
great
columns
altars
pews
far
away
a
light
flickered
and
twinkled
and
from
the
top
of
the
aisle
across
the
church
from
the
door
by
which
they
had
entered
a
radiance
glowed
and
lost
itself
in
the
black
spaces
of
the
high
roof
and
wide
nave
peter
crossed
towards
that
side
and
his
companion
followed
they
trod
softly
like
good
englishmen
in
church
and
they
moved
up
the
aisle
a
little
to
see
more
clearly
and
so
having
reached
a
place
from
which
much
was
visible
remained
standing
for
a
few
seconds
the
light
streamed
from
an
altar
and
from
candles
above
it
set
around
a
figure
of
the
mother
of
god
in
front
knelt
a
priest
and
behind
him
straggling
back
in
the
pews
a
score
or
so
of
women
some
children
and
a
french
soldier
or
two
the
priest
voice
sounded
thin
and
low
neither
could
hear
what
he
said
the
congregation
made
rapid
responses
regularly
but
eliding
the
to
them
familiar
words
there
was
then
the
murmur
of
repeated
prayer
like
muffled
knocking
on
a
door
and
nothing
more
let
go
whispered
pennell
at
last
they
went
out
and
shut
the
door
softly
behind
them
as
they
did
so
some
other
door
was
opened
noisily
and
banged
while
footsteps
began
to
drag
slowly
across
the
stone
floor
and
up
the
aisle
they
had
come
down
the
subsided
into
a
pew
with
a
clatter
on
the
boards
but
the
murmured
prayers
went
on
unbroken
outside
the
street
engulfed
them
the
same
faces
passed
by
a
banged
and
clattered
up
towards
the
centre
of
the
town
packed
with
jovial
people
pennell
looked
towards
it
half
longingly
great
scott
graham
i
wish
now
we
had
come
away
so
soon
he
said
chapter
viii
the
lower
valley
of
the
seine
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
interesting
in
northern
europe
it
was
the
high
street
of
old
normandy
and
feuda
barons
and
medieval
monks
have
left
their
mark
upon
it
from
the
castle
of
tancarville
to
the
abbey
of
jumièges
you
can
read
the
story
of
their
doings
or
when
you
stand
in
the
roman
circus
at
lillebonne
or
enter
the
ancient
cloister
of
modern
residence
at
wandrille
see
plainly
enough
the
writing
of
a
still
older
legend
such
as
appeared
once
on
the
wall
of
a
palace
in
babylon
on
the
left
bank
steep
hills
originally
wholly
clothed
with
forest
and
still
thickly
wooded
run
down
to
the
river
with
few
breaks
in
them
each
break
however
being
garrisoned
by
an
ancient
town
of
these
caudebec
stands
unrivalled
on
the
right
bank
the
flat
plain
of
normandy
stretches
to
the
in
spring
with
miles
of
the
white
clouds
chase
across
its
fair
blue
sky
driven
by
the
winds
from
the
sea
and
tall
poplars
rise
in
their
uniform
rows
along
the
river
as
if
to
guard
a
paradise
caudebec
can
be
reached
from
le
havre
in
a
few
hours
and
although
cars
for
hire
and
petrol
were
not
abundant
in
france
at
the
time
one
could
find
a
chauffeur
to
make
the
journey
if
one
was
prepared
to
pay
given
fine
weather
it
was
an
ideal
place
for
a
day
off
in
the
spring
and
peter
knew
it
in
the
grand
magasin
julie
had
talked
of
a
day
off
and
a
party
of
four
had
been
mooted
but
when
he
had
leisure
to
think
of
it
peter
found
himself
averse
to
four
and
particularly
if
one
of
the
four
were
to
be
donovan
he
admitted
it
freely
to
himself
donovan
was
the
kind
of
a
man
he
thought
that
julie
must
like
and
he
was
the
kind
of
man
too
to
put
him
peter
into
the
shade
ordinarily
he
asked
for
no
better
companion
but
he
hated
to
see
julie
and
jack
together
he
could
not
make
the
girl
out
and
he
wanted
to
do
so
he
wanted
to
know
what
she
thought
about
many
things
and
incidentally
of
course
what
she
thought
about
him
he
had
argued
all
this
over
next
morning
while
shaving
and
had
ended
by
cutting
himself
it
was
a
slight
matter
but
it
argued
a
certain
and
it
brought
him
back
to
decency
he
perceived
that
he
was
scheming
to
leave
his
friend
out
and
he
fought
resolutely
against
the
idea
therefore
that
afternoon
he
went
to
the
hospital
spent
a
couple
of
hours
chatting
with
the
men
and
finally
wound
up
in
the
nurses
for
tea
as
usual
it
was
a
little
room
long
and
narrow
at
the
end
of
the
biggest
ward
but
its
windows
looked
over
the
sea
and
it
was
convenient
to
the
kitchen
coloured
illustrations
cut
from
magazines
and
neatly
mounted
on
brown
paper
decorated
the
walls
but
there
was
little
else
by
way
of
furniture
or
ornament
except
a
long
table
and
chairs
one
could
get
but
little
talk
except
of
a
scrappy
kind
for
nurses
came
continually
in
and
out
for
tea
and
indeed
julie
had
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare
but
he
got
things
fixed
up
for
the
following
thursday
and
he
left
the
place
to
settle
with
donovan
that
gentleman
company
of
native
labour
was
lodged
a
mile
or
so
through
the
docks
from
peter
camp
on
the
banks
of
the
tancarville
canal
it
was
enlivened
at
frequent
intervals
day
and
night
by
the
sirens
of
tugs
bringing
strings
of
barges
to
the
docks
whence
their
cargo
was
borne
overseas
in
the
tramps
or
of
course
taking
equally
long
strings
to
the
seine
for
rouen
and
paris
it
was
mud
and
cinders
underfoot
and
it
was
walled
off
with
sheeting
and
barbed
wire
from
the
attentions
of
some
hundreds
of
belgian
refugees
who
lived
along
the
canal
and
parallel
roads
in
every
conceivable
kind
of
from
ancient
to
but
there
were
trees
along
the
canal
and
reeds
and
grass
so
that
there
were
worse
places
than
donovan
camp
in
le
havre
peter
found
his
friend
surveying
the
endeavours
of
a
gang
of
boys
to
construct
a
raised
causeway
from
the
officers
mess
to
the
and
he
promptly
broached
his
object
donovan
was
entranced
with
the
proposal
but
he
could
not
go
he
was
adamant
upon
it
he
could
possibly
have
got
off
but
it
meant
leaving
his
something
camp
for
a
whole
day
and
just
at
present
he
could
peter
could
get
pennell
or
anyone
another
time
perhaps
but
not
now
for
thus
can
the
devil
trap
his
victims
peter
pushed
back
for
home
on
his
bicycle
but
stopped
at
the
docks
on
his
way
to
look
up
pennell
that
gentleman
was
bored
weary
and
inclined
to
be
blasphemous
it
appeared
that
for
the
whole
infernal
day
he
had
had
to
watch
the
of
that
he
had
had
no
lunch
and
that
he
could
not
get
away
for
a
day
next
week
if
he
tried
it
everyone
can
get
a
day
off
whenever
he
wants
to
padre
he
said
in
the
next
war
i
shall
be
peter
turned
hard
on
his
heel
and
left
him
complaining
to
the
derricks
he
was
now
all
but
cornered
there
was
nobody
else
he
particularly
cared
to
ask
unless
it
were
arnold
and
he
could
not
imagine
arnold
and
julie
together
it
appeared
to
him
that
fate
was
on
his
side
it
only
remained
to
persuade
julie
to
come
alone
he
pedalled
back
to
mess
and
dinner
and
then
about
eight
strolled
round
to
the
hospital
again
it
was
late
of
course
but
he
was
a
padre
and
the
hospital
padre
and
privileged
he
knew
exactly
what
to
do
and
that
he
was
really
as
safe
as
houses
in
doing
it
and
yet
this
intriguing
by
night
made
him
uncomfortable
still
he
told
himself
he
was
an
ass
to
think
so
but
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
sensation
julie
would
be
on
duty
till
and
he
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
minutes
conversation
with
her
in
the
ward
he
followed
the
then
along
the
harbour
and
went
in
under
the
great
roof
of
the
empty
station
on
the
far
platform
a
hospital
train
was
being
made
ready
for
its
return
run
but
except
for
a
few
cleaners
and
orderlies
the
place
was
empty
an
iron
stairway
led
up
from
the
platform
to
the
wards
above
he
ascended
and
found
himself
on
a
landing
with
the
door
of
the
theatre
open
before
him
there
was
a
light
in
it
and
he
caught
the
sound
of
water
some
pro
was
cleaning
up
he
moved
down
the
passage
and
cautiously
opened
the
door
of
the
ward
it
was
shaded
and
still
somewhere
a
man
breathed
heavily
and
another
turned
in
his
sleep
just
beyond
the
red
glow
of
the
stove
with
the
empty
armchairs
in
a
circle
before
it
were
screens
from
which
came
a
subdued
light
he
walked
softly
between
the
beds
towards
them
and
looked
over
the
top
inside
was
a
little
sanctum
a
desk
with
a
shaded
a
chair
a
couch
a
little
table
with
flowers
upon
it
and
a
glass
and
jug
and
on
the
floor
by
the
couch
a
julie
was
at
the
desk
writing
in
a
big
official
book
and
he
watched
her
for
a
moment
unobserved
it
was
almost
as
if
he
saw
a
different
person
from
the
girl
he
knew
she
was
at
work
and
a
certain
hidden
sadness
showed
clearly
in
her
face
but
the
little
brown
fringe
of
hair
on
her
forehead
and
the
dimpled
chin
were
the
same
he
whispered
she
looked
up
quickly
with
a
start
and
he
noticed
curiously
how
rapidly
the
laughter
came
back
to
her
face
you
did
startle
me
solomon
she
said
what
is
it
i
want
to
speak
to
you
a
minute
about
thursday
he
said
can
i
come
in
she
got
up
and
came
round
the
screens
follow
me
she
said
and
make
a
noise
she
led
him
across
the
ward
to
the
wide
verandah
opening
the
door
carefully
and
leaving
it
open
behind
her
and
then
walked
to
the
balustrade
and
glanced
down
the
hospital
ship
had
gone
and
there
was
no
one
visible
on
the
wharf
the
stars
were
hidden
and
there
was
a
suggestion
of
mist
on
the
harbour
through
which
the
distant
lights
seemed
to
flicker
you
coming
on
solomon
she
said
mockingly
never
tell
me
have
dared
to
call
on
the
hospital
to
see
a
nurse
by
night
a
few
weeks
ago
suppose
matron
came
round
there
is
no
dangerous
case
in
my
ward
not
among
the
men
perhaps
said
peter
mischievously
but
look
here
about
thursday
donovan
ca
go
nor
pennell
and
i
do
know
anyone
else
i
want
to
ask
well
i
see
if
i
can
raise
a
man
one
or
two
of
the
doctors
are
fairly
decent
or
i
can
get
a
convalescent
out
of
the
hospital
she
had
the
lights
behind
her
and
he
could
not
see
her
face
but
he
knew
she
was
laughing
at
him
and
it
spurred
him
on
do
rag
julie
he
said
you
know
i
want
you
to
come
alone
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
then
i
ca
cut
tommy
she
said
not
for
once
he
urged
she
turned
away
from
him
and
looked
down
at
the
water
it
is
curious
how
there
come
moments
of
apprehension
in
all
our
lives
when
we
want
a
thing
but
know
quite
well
we
are
mad
to
want
it
julie
looked
into
the
future
for
a
few
seconds
and
saw
plainly
but
would
not
believe
what
she
saw
when
she
turned
back
she
had
her
old
manner
completely
you
a
dear
old
thing
she
said
and
i
do
it
but
if
it
gets
out
that
i
gadded
about
for
a
day
with
an
officer
even
though
he
is
a
padre
and
that
we
went
miles
out
of
town
there
be
some
row
my
boy
quick
now
i
must
get
back
what
the
plan
thanks
awfully
said
peter
it
will
be
a
rag
what
time
can
you
get
off
oh
after
breakfast
easily
say
right
well
take
the
to
harfleur
you
know
as
far
as
it
goes
i
be
at
the
terminus
with
a
car
what
time
must
you
be
in
i
can
get
late
leave
till
ten
i
think
she
said
good
that
gives
us
heaps
of
time
we
lunch
and
tea
in
caudebec
and
have
some
sandwiches
for
the
road
home
and
if
the
car
breaks
down
it
wo
said
peter
you
lucky
in
love
are
you
she
did
not
laugh
i
do
know
she
said
and
then
peter
had
walked
home
thinking
of
hilda
and
he
had
sat
by
the
sea
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
rotter
but
in
the
web
of
fate
and
much
to
be
pitied
which
is
like
a
man
and
then
he
had
played
auction
till
midnight
and
lost
ten
francs
and
gone
to
bed
concluding
that
he
was
certainly
unlucky
at
cards
as
peter
sat
in
his
car
at
the
harfleur
terminus
that
thursday
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
was
largely
indifferent
to
the
beauties
of
the
seine
valley
that
he
had
professedly
come
to
see
he
was
nervous
to
begin
with
lest
he
should
be
recognised
by
anyone
and
he
was
in
one
of
his
troubled
moods
but
he
had
not
long
to
wait
the
tram
came
out
and
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
walked
to
meet
the
passengers
julie
looked
very
smart
in
the
grey
with
its
touch
of
scarlet
but
she
was
discontented
with
it
if
only
i
could
put
on
a
few
glad
rags
she
said
as
she
climbed
into
the
car
this
would
be
perfect
you
men
know
how
a
girl
comes
to
hate
uniform
it
not
bad
occasionally
but
if
you
have
to
wear
it
always
it
spoils
chances
but
i
got
my
new
shoes
and
silk
stockings
on
she
added
sticking
out
a
neat
ankle
and
my
skirt
is
not
vastly
long
is
it
besides
underneath
if
it
any
consolation
to
you
i
really
pretty
things
uniform
or
not
i
see
no
reason
why
one
should
not
feel
joyful
next
the
skin
what
do
you
think
peter
agreed
heartily
and
tucked
a
rug
round
her
there
the
more
need
for
this
then
he
said
oh
i
do
know
silk
always
makes
me
feel
so
comfortable
that
i
be
cold
is
it
a
heavenly
day
we
are
lucky
you
know
it
might
have
been
beastly
lor
but
i
going
to
enjoy
myself
my
dear
i
warn
you
i
got
to
forget
how
tommy
looked
when
i
put
her
off
with
excuses
i
felt
positively
mean
what
did
she
say
asked
peter
that
she
did
mind
at
all
as
she
had
got
to
write
letters
said
julie
solomon
tommy
a
damned
good
sort
give
us
a
cigarette
and
do
look
blue
we
right
out
of
town
peter
got
out
his
case
do
call
me
solomon
he
said
julie
threw
herself
back
in
her
corner
and
shrieked
with
laughter
the
french
chauffeur
glanced
round
and
grimaced
appreciatively
and
peter
felt
a
fool
what
am
i
to
call
you
then
she
demanded
you
are
a
funny
old
thing
and
now
you
look
more
of
a
solomon
than
ever
call
me
peter
he
said
she
looked
at
him
her
eyes
sparkling
with
amusement
i
really
beginning
to
enjoy
myself
she
said
but
look
here
you
must
begin
like
this
how
in
the
world
do
you
think
we
shall
end
up
if
you
do
you
have
nothing
left
to
say
and
i
shall
be
worn
to
a
rag
and
a
temper
warding
off
your
sentimentality
julie
said
peter
are
you
ever
serious
i
ca
help
it
you
know
i
suppose
because
i
am
a
parson
though
i
am
such
a
rotten
one
who
says
you
a
rotten
one
everybody
who
tells
the
truth
and
besides
i
know
it
i
feel
an
absolute
stummer
when
i
go
around
the
wards
i
never
can
say
a
word
to
the
men
they
like
you
awfully
you
know
little
jimmy
that
kiddie
who
came
in
the
other
day
who
always
such
a
brick
well
last
night
i
went
and
sat
with
him
a
bit
because
he
was
in
such
pain
i
told
him
where
i
was
going
as
a
secret
what
do
you
think
he
said
about
you
i
do
want
to
know
said
peter
hastily
well
you
shall
he
said
if
more
parsons
were
like
you
more
men
would
go
to
church
what
do
you
make
of
that
old
solomon
it
is
true
to
start
with
a
few
might
come
for
a
little
but
they
would
soon
fall
off
and
if
they
did
they
get
no
good
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
them
julie
threw
away
her
one
sees
a
lot
of
human
nature
in
hospitals
my
boy
she
said
and
it
does
leave
one
with
many
illusions
but
from
what
i
seen
i
should
say
nobody
does
much
good
by
talking
you
do
understand
said
peter
look
here
i
should
call
you
religious
in
a
way
at
all
do
be
angry
i
do
but
i
think
so
and
i
do
think
you
can
possibly
know
what
i
mean
i
used
to
do
the
flowers
in
church
regularly
at
home
she
said
i
believe
in
god
though
you
think
i
do
peter
sighed
let
change
the
subject
he
said
have
you
seen
any
more
of
that
australian
chap
lately
rather
he
engaged
to
a
girl
i
know
and
i
reckon
i
doing
her
a
good
turn
by
sticking
to
him
he
a
bit
of
a
devil
you
know
but
i
think
i
can
keep
him
off
the
french
girls
a
bit
peter
looked
at
her
curiously
you
know
what
he
is
and
you
do
mind
then
he
said
good
lord
no
she
replied
my
dear
boy
i
know
what
men
are
it
in
their
nature
to
stick
to
one
girl
only
he
loves
edie
all
right
and
he
make
her
a
good
husband
one
day
if
she
is
too
particular
and
inquisitive
if
i
were
married
i
give
my
husband
absolute
liberty
and
i
expect
it
in
return
but
i
shall
never
marry
there
is
a
man
who
can
play
fair
they
take
their
own
pleasures
but
they
are
all
as
jealous
as
possible
i
seen
it
hundreds
of
times
you
amaze
me
said
peter
let
talk
straight
do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
you
were
married
and
your
husband
ran
up
to
paris
for
a
fortnight
and
you
knew
exactly
what
he
gone
for
you
would
mind
no
she
declared
roundly
i
would
he
come
back
all
the
more
fond
of
me
i
know
i
be
a
fool
to
expect
anything
else
peter
stared
at
her
she
was
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
seen
her
moral
standards
if
she
had
any
he
added
mentally
were
so
different
from
his
own
that
he
was
absolutely
floored
he
thought
grimly
that
alone
in
a
he
had
got
among
the
multitude
with
a
vengeance
have
you
ever
been
in
love
he
demanded
she
laughed
solomon
you
the
quaintest
creature
do
you
think
tell
you
if
i
had
been
you
never
ought
to
ask
anyone
that
but
if
you
want
to
know
i
been
in
love
hundreds
of
times
it
a
queer
disease
but
not
serious
at
least
not
if
you
do
take
it
too
seriously
you
do
know
what
love
is
at
all
he
said
she
faced
him
fairly
and
unashamed
i
do
she
said
it
an
animal
passion
for
the
purpose
of
populating
the
earth
and
if
you
ask
me
i
think
it
is
rather
a
dirty
trick
on
the
part
of
god
you
do
mean
that
he
said
distressed
she
laughed
again
merrily
and
slipped
her
hand
into
his
under
the
rug
peter
she
said
there
am
i
not
good
you
are
made
to
worry
about
these
things
i
do
know
that
anyone
is
we
ca
help
ourselves
and
the
best
thing
is
to
take
our
pleasures
when
we
can
find
them
i
suppose
you
be
shocked
at
me
but
i
not
going
to
pretend
i
was
built
that
way
if
this
were
a
closed
car
i
give
you
a
kiss
i
do
want
that
sort
of
a
kiss
he
said
that
was
what
you
gave
me
the
other
night
i
want
you
do
know
what
you
want
my
dear
though
you
think
you
do
you
should
be
so
serious
i
sure
i
kiss
very
nicely
plenty
of
men
think
so
anyway
and
if
there
is
nothing
in
that
sort
of
kiss
why
not
kiss
is
there
a
commandment
against
it
i
suppose
our
grandmothers
thought
so
but
we
do
besides
i
been
east
of
suez
where
there
ai
no
ten
commandments
there
only
one
real
rule
left
in
life
for
most
of
us
peter
and
that
this
a
good
pal
and
do
worry
peter
sighed
you
and
i
were
turned
out
differently
julie
he
said
but
i
like
you
awfully
you
attract
me
so
much
that
i
do
know
how
to
express
it
there
nothing
mean
about
you
and
nothing
sham
and
i
admire
your
pluck
beyond
words
it
seems
to
me
that
you
looked
life
in
the
face
and
laughed
anybody
can
laugh
at
death
but
very
few
of
us
at
life
i
think
i
terrified
of
it
and
that
the
awful
part
about
it
all
for
i
ought
to
know
the
secret
and
i
do
i
feel
an
absolute
hypocrite
at
times
when
i
take
a
service
for
example
i
talk
about
things
i
do
understand
in
the
least
even
about
god
and
i
begin
to
think
i
know
nothing
about
him
he
broke
off
utterly
miserable
poor
old
boy
she
said
softly
is
it
as
bad
as
that
he
turned
to
her
fiercely
you
darling
he
said
carried
away
by
her
tone
i
believe
i
rather
have
you
than
than
god
she
did
not
move
in
her
corner
nor
did
she
smile
now
i
wonder
she
said
slowly
peter
it
you
that
hate
shams
not
i
it
you
that
are
brave
not
i
play
with
shams
because
i
know
they
shams
but
i
like
playing
with
them
but
you
are
greater
than
i
you
are
not
content
with
playing
one
of
these
days
oh
i
do
know
she
broke
off
and
looked
away
peter
gripped
her
hand
tightly
do
little
girl
he
said
forget
for
look
at
those
primroses
they
the
first
i
seen
are
they
heavenly
they
ran
into
caudebec
in
good
time
and
lunched
at
an
hotel
overlooking
the
river
with
great
enthusiasm
to
peter
it
was
utterly
delicious
to
have
her
by
him
she
was
as
gay
as
she
could
possibly
be
and
made
fun
over
everything
sitting
daintily
before
him
her
daring
unconventional
talk
carried
him
away
she
chose
the
wine
and
after
sat
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
puffing
at
a
cigarette
her
brown
eyes
alight
with
mischief
apparently
without
a
thought
for
oh
i
say
she
said
do
look
at
that
party
in
the
corner
the
old
major
well
away
and
the
girl
have
a
job
to
keep
him
in
hand
i
wonder
where
they
from
rouen
perhaps
there
was
a
car
at
the
door
what
do
you
think
of
the
girl
peter
glanced
back
no
better
than
she
ought
to
be
he
said
no
i
do
suppose
so
but
they
are
gay
these
french
girls
i
wonder
men
like
them
and
they
have
a
hard
time
i
give
them
a
leg
up
any
day
if
i
could
i
ca
though
so
if
ever
you
get
a
chance
do
it
for
me
will
you
peter
assented
come
on
he
said
finish
that
glass
if
you
think
you
can
and
let
get
out
here
the
best
then
i
done
what
are
we
going
to
see
for
a
couple
of
hours
they
wandered
round
the
old
town
with
its
narrow
streets
and
even
houses
whose
backs
actually
leaned
over
the
swift
little
river
that
ran
all
but
under
the
place
to
the
seine
they
penetrated
through
an
old
mill
to
its
back
premises
and
climbed
precariously
round
the
to
reach
a
little
platform
from
which
the
few
remaining
massive
stones
of
the
norman
wall
and
castle
could
still
be
seen
the
old
abbey
kept
them
a
good
while
julie
interested
peter
enormously
as
they
walked
about
its
cool
aisles
and
tried
to
make
out
the
legends
of
its
ancient
glass
she
had
nothing
of
that
curious
kind
of
shyness
most
people
have
in
a
church
and
that
he
would
certainly
have
expected
of
her
she
joked
and
laughed
a
little
in
it
at
a
queer
row
of
mutilated
statues
packed
into
a
kind
of
chapel
to
keep
quiet
out
of
the
way
till
wanted
at
the
vivid
red
of
the
red
sea
engulfing
pharaoh
and
all
his
host
but
not
in
the
least
irreverently
he
recalled
a
saying
of
a
book
he
had
once
read
in
which
a
roman
catholic
priest
had
defended
the
homeliness
of
an
italian
congregation
by
saying
that
it
was
right
for
them
to
be
at
home
in
their
father
house
it
was
almost
as
if
julie
were
at
home
yet
he
shrank
from
the
inference
she
was
entirely
ignorant
of
everything
except
perhaps
of
a
little
biblical
history
but
she
made
a
most
interested
audience
once
he
thought
she
was
perhaps
egging
him
on
for
his
own
pleasure
but
when
he
grew
more
silent
she
urged
him
to
explain
it
ripping
going
round
with
somebody
who
knows
something
she
said
most
of
the
men
one
meets
know
absolutely
nothing
they
very
jolly
but
one
gets
tired
i
could
listen
to
you
for
ages
peter
assured
her
that
he
was
almost
as
ignorant
as
they
but
she
was
shrewdly
insistent
you
read
more
and
you
understand
what
you
read
she
said
most
people
do
i
know
they
bought
picture
off
a
queer
old
woman
in
a
peasant
and
then
came
back
to
the
river
and
sat
under
the
shade
of
a
line
of
great
trees
to
wait
for
the
tea
the
hotel
had
guaranteed
them
julie
now
did
all
the
talking
of
south
africa
of
gay
adventures
in
france
and
on
the
voyage
and
of
the
men
she
had
met
she
was
as
frank
as
possible
but
peter
wondered
how
far
he
was
getting
to
know
the
real
girl
tea
was
an
unusual
success
for
france
it
was
real
tea
but
then
there
was
reason
for
that
for
julie
had
insisted
on
going
into
the
big
kitchen
to
madame
amusement
and
monsieur
open
admiration
and
making
it
herself
but
the
chocolate
cakes
the
white
bread
and
proper
butter
and
the
cream
were
a
miracle
peter
wondered
if
you
could
get
such
things
in
england
now
and
julie
gaily
told
him
that
the
french
made
laws
only
to
break
them
with
several
instances
thereof
she
declared
that
if
a
officer
existed
in
caudebec
he
must
be
in
love
with
the
landlady
daughter
and
that
she
only
wished
she
could
get
to
know
such
an
official
in
havre
the
daughter
in
question
waited
on
them
and
julie
and
she
chummed
up
immensely
finally
she
was
despatched
to
produce
a
collection
of
army
badges
and
buttons
scalps
julie
called
them
when
they
came
they
turned
them
over
all
ranks
were
represented
or
nearly
so
and
most
regiments
that
either
could
remember
there
were
canadian
australian
and
south
african
badges
and
at
last
julie
declared
that
only
one
was
wanting
what
will
you
give
for
this
officer
badge
she
demanded
seizing
hold
of
one
of
peter
maltese
crosses
the
girl
looked
at
it
curiously
what
is
it
she
said
it
the
badge
of
the
sacred
legion
said
julie
gravely
you
know
malta
well
that
part
of
the
british
empire
of
course
and
the
english
used
to
have
a
regiment
there
to
defend
it
from
the
turks
it
was
a
great
honour
to
join
and
so
it
was
called
the
sacred
legion
this
officer
is
a
captain
in
it
shut
up
julie
said
peter
but
nothing
would
stop
her
come
now
she
said
what
will
you
give
you
give
her
one
for
a
kiss
wo
you
solomon
the
girl
laughed
and
blushed
not
before
mademoiselle
she
said
looking
at
peter
oh
i
off
cried
julie
i
spare
you
one
but
only
one
remember
and
she
deliberately
got
up
and
left
them
mademoiselle
was
tres
jolie
said
the
girl
collecting
her
badges
peter
detached
a
cross
and
gave
it
her
and
she
demurely
put
up
her
mouth
he
kissed
her
lightly
and
walked
leisurely
out
to
settle
the
bill
and
call
the
car
he
had
entirely
forgotten
his
depression
and
the
world
seemed
good
to
him
he
hummed
a
little
song
by
the
water
edge
as
he
waited
and
thought
over
the
day
he
could
never
remember
having
had
such
a
one
in
his
life
then
he
recollected
that
one
badge
was
gone
and
he
abstracted
the
other
without
his
badges
he
would
not
be
known
as
a
chaplain
when
julie
appeared
she
made
no
remark
as
he
had
they
got
in
and
started
off
back
in
the
cooling
evening
near
tancarville
they
stopped
the
car
to
have
the
hood
put
up
and
strolled
up
into
the
grounds
of
the
old
castle
while
they
waited
extraordinary
it
must
have
been
to
have
lived
in
a
place
like
this
said
peter
rather
said
julie
and
beyond
words
awful
to
the
women
i
can
not
imagine
what
they
must
have
been
like
but
i
think
they
must
have
been
something
like
native
african
women
why
queried
peter
oh
because
a
native
woman
never
reads
and
hardly
goes
five
miles
from
her
village
she
is
a
human
animal
who
bears
children
and
keeps
the
house
of
her
master
that
all
that
what
these
women
must
have
done
the
church
produced
some
different
types
said
peter
but
they
had
no
chance
elsewhere
perhaps
still
i
expect
they
were
as
happy
as
we
perhaps
happier
and
their
cows
were
happier
still
i
should
think
laughed
julie
no
you
ca
persuade
me
i
would
have
been
a
woman
in
those
days
for
the
world
and
now
asked
peter
rather
we
have
much
the
best
time
on
the
whole
we
can
do
what
we
like
pretty
well
if
we
want
to
be
men
we
can
we
can
put
on
even
and
run
a
farm
but
if
we
like
we
can
wear
glad
rags
and
nice
undies
and
be
more
women
than
ever
and
in
the
end
thereof
peter
could
help
asking
oh
said
julie
lightly
one
can
settle
down
and
have
babies
if
one
wants
to
and
sit
in
a
and
talk
scandal
as
much
as
one
likes
not
that
i
shall
do
either
thank
you
i
shall
oh
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
solomon
you
are
at
your
worst
pick
me
some
of
those
primroses
and
let
be
going
you
never
can
tell
we
may
have
to
walk
home
yet
peter
plucked
a
few
of
the
early
blooms
and
she
pushed
them
into
her
then
they
went
back
to
the
car
and
got
in
again
cold
he
asked
after
a
little
a
bit
she
said
tuck
me
up
and
do
sit
in
that
far
corner
all
the
time
you
make
me
feel
chilly
to
look
at
you
i
hate
sentimental
people
but
if
you
tried
hard
and
were
nice
i
could
work
up
quite
a
lot
of
sentiment
just
now
he
laughed
and
tucked
her
up
as
required
then
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
slipped
his
arm
round
her
waist
is
that
better
he
said
much
but
you
ca
have
had
much
practice
now
tell
me
stories
peter
had
a
mind
to
tell
her
several
but
he
refrained
and
they
grew
silent
do
you
think
we
shall
have
another
day
like
this
he
demanded
after
a
little
i
do
see
why
not
she
said
but
one
never
knows
does
one
the
chances
are
we
sha
it
a
queer
old
world
let
try
anyway
i
loved
it
he
said
so
have
i
said
julie
it
the
best
day
i
had
for
a
long
time
peter
you
a
nice
person
to
go
out
with
you
know
though
i
flatter
you
too
much
you
should
develop
the
gift
it
not
everyone
that
has
it
i
no
wish
to
he
said
you
are
an
old
bear
she
laughed
but
you
do
mean
all
you
say
or
rather
you
do
for
you
will
say
what
you
mean
you
should
peter
not
done
nowadays
and
it
gives
one
away
if
you
were
like
me
now
you
could
say
and
do
anything
and
nobody
would
mind
they
never
know
what
you
meant
and
of
course
all
the
time
you
mean
nothing
so
you
mean
nothing
all
the
time
he
queried
of
course
she
said
merrily
what
do
you
think
that
jarred
peter
a
little
so
he
said
nothing
and
silence
fell
on
them
and
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
in
the
city
he
asked
if
she
would
mind
finishing
alone
not
a
bit
old
thing
if
you
want
to
go
anywhere
she
said
he
apologised
arnold
he
our
padre
is
likely
to
be
at
the
club
and
i
promised
i
walk
home
with
him
he
lied
remorselessly
it
beastly
rude
i
know
but
i
thought
you
understand
she
looked
at
him
and
laughed
i
believe
i
do
she
said
he
stopped
the
car
and
got
out
settling
with
the
man
and
glancing
up
at
a
clock
you
be
in
at
he
said
as
proper
as
possible
and
thank
you
so
much
for
coming
thank
you
solomon
she
replied
it
been
just
topping
thanks
awfully
for
taking
me
and
come
in
to
tea
soon
wo
you
he
promised
and
held
out
his
hand
she
pressed
it
and
waved
out
of
the
window
as
the
car
drove
off
and
no
sooner
was
it
in
motion
than
he
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
yet
he
knew
why
he
had
done
as
he
had
there
in
the
middle
of
the
town
he
knew
that
he
feared
she
would
kiss
him
again
as
before
not
noticing
where
he
went
he
set
off
through
the
streets
making
unconsciously
almost
for
the
sea
and
the
dark
boulevards
that
led
from
the
gaily
lit
centre
of
the
city
towards
it
he
walked
slowly
his
mind
a
chaos
of
thoughts
and
so
ran
into
a
curious
adventure
as
he
passed
a
he
heard
a
man
uneven
steps
on
the
pavement
a
girl
voice
a
curse
and
the
sound
of
a
fall
then
followed
an
exclamation
in
another
woman
voice
and
a
quick
sentence
in
french
peter
hesitated
a
minute
and
then
turned
down
the
road
to
where
a
small
group
was
faintly
visible
as
he
reached
it
he
saw
that
a
couple
of
street
girls
were
bending
over
a
man
who
lay
sprawling
on
the
ground
and
he
quickened
his
steps
to
a
run
his
boots
were
and
all
but
noiseless
here
i
say
he
said
as
he
came
up
let
that
man
alone
what
are
you
doing
he
added
in
halting
french
one
of
the
two
girls
gave
a
little
scream
but
the
other
straightened
herself
and
peter
perceived
that
he
knew
her
it
was
louise
of
travalini
what
are
you
doing
he
demanded
again
in
english
is
he
hurt
non
non
monsieur
said
louise
he
is
but
we
found
him
a
little
way
down
the
street
and
he
can
not
walk
easily
so
we
help
him
if
the
gendarme
how
do
you
call
him
the
see
him
maybe
he
will
get
into
trouble
but
now
you
come
you
will
doubtless
help
him
vraiment
he
is
in
luck
we
go
now
monsieur
peter
bent
over
the
fallen
man
he
did
not
know
him
but
saw
he
was
a
subaltern
though
a
man
the
fellow
was
very
drunk
and
did
little
else
than
stutter
curses
in
which
the
name
of
our
lord
was
frequent
peter
pulled
at
his
arm
and
louise
stooped
to
help
him
once
up
he
got
his
arm
round
him
and
demanded
where
he
lived
the
man
stared
at
them
foolishly
peter
gave
him
a
bit
of
a
shake
and
demanded
the
address
again
come
on
he
said
pull
yourself
together
for
the
lord
sake
we
shall
end
before
the
if
you
do
your
camp
you
fool
at
that
the
man
told
him
stammeringly
and
peter
sighed
his
relief
i
know
he
said
to
louise
it
not
far
i
maybe
get
a
taxi
at
the
corner
she
pushed
him
towards
a
doorway
wait
a
minute
she
said
i
live
here
it
all
right
i
will
get
a
fiacre
i
know
where
to
find
one
she
darted
away
it
seemed
long
to
peter
but
in
a
few
minutes
a
horn
tooted
and
a
cab
came
round
the
corner
between
them
they
got
the
subaltern
in
and
peter
gave
the
address
then
he
pulled
out
his
purse
before
stepping
in
himself
opened
it
found
a
note
and
offered
it
to
louise
the
girl
of
the
street
and
the
tavern
pushed
it
away
la
she
exclaimed
vite
get
in
bon
dieu
should
i
be
paid
for
a
kindness
poor
boy
he
does
not
know
what
he
does
he
will
a
head
ah
terrible
in
the
morning
and
see
he
has
fought
for
la
patrie
she
pointed
to
a
gold
on
his
arm
bon
soir
monsieur
she
stepped
back
and
spoke
quickly
to
the
driver
who
was
watching
sardonically
he
nodded
bon
soir
monsieur
she
said
again
and
disappeared
in
the
doorway
chapter
ix
a
few
weeks
later
the
war
office
if
it
was
the
war
office
but
one
gets
into
the
habit
of
attributing
these
things
to
the
war
office
had
one
of
its
regular
spasms
it
woke
up
suddenly
with
a
touch
of
nightmare
and
it
got
fearfully
busy
for
a
few
weeks
before
going
to
sleep
again
all
manner
of
innocent
people
were
dragged
into
the
vortex
of
its
activities
and
blameless
lives
were
disturbed
and
terrorised
this
particular
enthusiasm
involved
even
such
placid
and
contented
souls
as
the
the
principal
chaplain
their
entire
staffs
and
a
great
many
of
their
rank
and
file
it
created
a
new
department
acquired
many
additional
offices
for
the
dragged
from
their
comfortable
billets
a
certain
number
of
base
officers
and
then
by
the
mercy
of
providence
flickered
out
almost
as
soon
as
the
said
officers
bad
made
themselves
a
little
more
comfortable
than
before
in
their
new
posts
it
was
so
widespread
a
disturbance
that
even
peter
graham
most
harmless
of
men
with
plenty
of
his
own
fish
to
fry
was
dragged
into
it
as
some
leaf
floating
placidly
downstream
may
be
caught
and
whirled
away
in
an
excited
eddy
more
definitely
it
removed
him
from
havre
and
julie
just
when
he
was
beginning
to
want
most
definitely
to
stay
there
and
of
course
when
it
happened
he
could
hardly
know
that
it
was
to
be
but
a
temporary
separation
he
was
summoned
then
one
fine
morning
to
his
office
in
town
and
he
departed
on
a
bicycle
turning
over
in
his
mind
such
indiscretions
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
and
wondering
which
of
them
was
about
to
trip
him
pennell
had
been
confident
indeed
and
particular
you
for
it
old
bean
he
had
said
there
a
limit
to
the
patience
even
of
the
church
they
are
going
to
say
that
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
visit
hospitals
after
dark
and
that
their
padres
must
be
seen
out
with
nurses
who
smoke
in
public
and
all
power
to
their
elbow
i
say
peter
reply
was
certainly
not
in
the
and
would
probably
have
scandalised
its
compilers
but
he
thought
secretly
that
there
might
be
something
in
what
his
friend
said
consequently
he
rode
his
bicycle
carelessly
and
was
indifferent
to
and
some
six
inches
of
nice
sticky
mud
on
parts
of
the
in
the
ordinary
course
therefore
these
things
revenged
themselves
upon
him
he
came
off
neatly
and
conveniently
opposite
a
small
at
a
turn
in
the
dock
road
and
the
mud
prevented
the
from
seriously
hurting
him
a
frenchman
minding
the
picked
him
up
and
he
madame
her
assistant
and
a
customer
carried
him
into
the
kitchen
off
the
bar
and
washed
and
dried
him
the
least
he
could
do
was
a
glass
of
french
beer
all
round
with
a
franc
to
the
dock
labourer
who
straightened
his
and
tucked
in
a
loose
spoke
and
for
all
this
the
war
office
if
it
was
the
war
office
for
it
may
quite
possibly
have
been
lord
northcliffe
or
bottomley
or
some
other
controller
of
our
national
life
was
directly
responsible
when
one
thinks
that
in
a
hundred
places
just
such
disturbances
were
in
progress
in
ten
times
as
many
innocent
lives
one
is
appalled
at
their
effrontery
they
ought
to
eat
and
drink
more
carefully
or
take
liver
pills
however
in
due
time
peter
sailed
up
to
the
office
of
his
immediate
chief
but
little
the
worse
for
wear
and
was
ushered
in
he
was
prepared
for
a
solitary
interview
but
he
found
a
council
of
some
two
dozen
persons
who
included
an
itinerant
bishop
an
oxford
professor
a
few
ladies
and
triumph
of
the
a
labour
member
peter
could
not
conceive
that
so
great
a
weight
of
intellect
could
be
involved
in
his
affairs
and
took
comfort
he
seated
himself
on
a
wooden
chair
and
put
on
his
most
intelligent
appearance
and
if
it
was
slightly
marred
by
a
mud
streak
at
the
back
of
his
ear
overlooked
by
madame
kindly
assistant
who
had
attended
to
that
side
of
him
he
was
not
really
to
blame
again
it
was
the
fault
of
lord
northcliffe
or
or
any
of
the
rest
of
them
it
transpired
that
he
was
slightly
late
the
bishop
had
been
speaking
he
was
a
good
bishop
and
eloquent
and
as
the
who
now
rose
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
remarked
he
had
struck
the
right
note
in
all
probability
it
was
due
to
peter
having
missed
that
note
that
he
was
so
critical
of
the
scheme
the
note
would
have
toned
him
up
he
would
have
felt
a
more
generous
sympathy
for
the
lads
in
the
field
and
would
have
been
more
definitely
convinced
that
something
must
be
done
if
not
plainly
stated
in
the
holy
scriptures
his
lordship
had
at
least
found
it
indicated
there
but
peter
was
not
aware
of
this
he
only
observed
that
the
note
had
made
everyone
solemn
and
intense
except
the
labour
member
that
gentleman
indeed
interrupted
the
before
he
was
fairly
on
his
legs
with
the
remark
beggin
your
pardon
sir
but
as
this
is
an
informal
conference
does
anyone
mind
if
i
smoke
peter
was
anything
but
a
fool
and
the
nightmare
from
headquarters
had
genuinely
communicated
itself
to
him
he
felt
all
he
said
and
he
said
it
ably
he
lacked
only
in
one
regard
he
had
never
been
down
among
the
multitude
he
knew
exactly
what
would
have
to
have
been
in
his
own
mind
for
him
to
act
as
he
believed
some
of
them
were
acting
and
he
knew
exactly
how
he
would
in
so
deplorable
a
condition
of
affairs
have
set
about
remedying
it
these
things
then
he
stated
boldly
and
clearly
as
he
proceeded
the
ladies
got
out
notebooks
the
professor
allowed
himself
occasional
applause
and
the
labour
member
lit
another
pipe
it
appeared
that
there
was
extreme
unrest
and
agitation
among
the
troops
or
at
least
a
section
of
the
troops
for
no
one
could
say
that
the
armies
in
the
field
were
not
magnificent
they
had
got
to
remember
that
the
tommy
of
was
not
as
the
tommy
of
yesterday
not
that
he
suffered
by
comparison
but
that
he
was
far
better
educated
and
far
more
inclined
to
think
for
himself
they
were
well
aware
that
a
little
knowledge
was
a
dangerous
thing
or
again
as
his
friend
the
bishop
would
have
doubtless
put
it
how
great
a
matter
a
little
fire
kindleth
there
was
no
escaping
it
foreign
propaganda
certain
undesirable
books
and
papers
books
and
papers
he
need
hardly
say
outside
the
control
of
the
reputable
press
and
even
socialistic
agitators
were
abroad
in
the
army
he
did
not
wish
to
say
too
much
it
was
enough
to
remind
them
of
what
possibly
they
already
knew
that
certain
depots
on
certain
occasions
had
refused
to
sing
the
national
anthem
and
were
not
content
with
their
wages
insignificant
as
these
things
might
be
in
detail
had
felt
there
was
justifiable
cause
for
alarm
this
meeting
had
gathered
to
consider
plans
for
a
remedy
now
he
thanked
god
that
they
were
not
prussians
there
must
be
no
attempt
at
coercion
a
war
for
liberty
must
be
won
by
free
people
one
had
of
course
to
have
discipline
in
the
army
but
theirs
was
a
citizen
army
his
friend
who
had
left
his
parliamentary
duties
to
visit
france
might
rest
assured
that
the
organizations
represented
there
that
morning
would
not
forget
that
in
a
word
tommy
had
a
vote
and
he
was
entitled
to
it
and
should
keep
it
one
day
he
should
even
use
it
and
although
no
one
could
wish
to
change
horses
crossing
a
stream
still
they
hoped
that
day
would
speedily
come
the
day
of
peace
and
victory
but
meantime
what
was
to
be
done
as
the
bishop
had
rightly
said
something
must
be
done
resolute
on
this
point
had
called
in
the
and
the
and
he
believed
expert
opinion
on
both
sides
the
house
of
commons
and
the
general
opinion
agreed
upon
was
that
tommy
should
be
educated
to
vote
correctly
when
the
time
came
and
to
wait
peacefully
for
that
time
the
professor
could
tell
them
of
schemes
even
now
in
process
of
formation
at
home
in
order
that
the
land
they
loved
might
be
cleaner
sweeter
better
and
happier
in
the
days
to
come
but
tommy
meantime
did
not
know
of
these
things
he
was
apparently
under
the
delusion
that
he
must
work
out
his
own
salvation
whereas
in
point
of
fact
it
was
being
worked
out
for
him
scientifically
and
religiously
if
these
things
were
clearly
laid
before
him
was
convinced
that
agitation
dissatisfaction
and
even
revolution
for
there
were
those
who
thought
they
were
actually
trending
in
that
direction
would
be
nipped
in
the
bud
the
scheme
was
simple
and
lectures
would
be
given
all
over
the
areas
occupied
by
british
troops
every
base
would
be
organised
in
such
a
way
that
such
lectures
and
even
detailed
courses
of
study
should
be
available
for
everyone
every
chaplain
hutworker
and
social
entertainer
must
do
his
or
her
bit
they
must
know
how
to
speak
wisely
and
well
not
all
in
public
but
everyone
as
the
occasion
offered
privately
in
hut
or
camp
to
inquiring
and
dissatisfied
tommies
they
would
doubtless
feel
themselves
insufficient
for
these
things
but
were
to
be
formed
and
literature
obtained
which
would
completely
furnish
them
with
information
he
would
conclude
by
merely
laying
on
the
table
a
bundle
of
the
splendid
papers
and
tracts
already
prepared
for
this
work
the
professor
would
now
outline
what
was
being
attempted
at
home
and
then
the
meeting
would
be
open
for
discussion
the
professor
was
given
half
an
hour
and
he
made
an
excellent
speech
for
a
cornered
and
academic
theorist
the
first
ten
minutes
he
devoted
to
explaining
that
he
could
not
explain
in
the
time
in
the
second
tempering
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
he
pointed
out
that
it
was
no
use
his
outlining
schemes
not
yet
completed
or
that
they
could
read
for
themselves
or
that
possibly
without
some
groundwork
they
could
not
understand
and
in
the
third
ten
minutes
he
outlined
the
committees
dealing
with
the
work
and
containing
such
names
as
robert
smiley
button
and
clydens
he
sat
down
everyone
applauded
the
and
possibly
the
because
they
honestly
knew
and
respected
these
gentlemen
and
the
rest
because
they
felt
they
ought
to
do
so
the
meeting
was
then
opened
for
discussion
peter
took
no
part
in
what
followed
and
indeed
nothing
was
said
save
one
remark
cast
upon
the
waters
by
the
labour
member
which
was
destined
to
be
found
after
many
days
they
were
talking
of
the
lectures
and
one
of
the
ladies
peter
understood
a
girton
lecturer
was
apparently
eager
to
begin
without
delay
the
begged
to
ask
a
question
were
there
to
be
questions
and
a
discussion
the
glanced
at
a
paper
before
him
and
rose
he
apologised
for
omitting
to
mention
it
before
but
thought
it
would
be
subverse
of
all
discipline
if
let
us
say
privates
should
be
allowed
to
get
up
and
argue
with
the
officers
who
might
have
addressed
them
they
all
knew
what
might
be
said
in
the
heat
of
argument
also
if
he
might
venture
to
say
so
some
of
their
lecturers
though
primed
with
the
right
lecture
might
not
be
such
experts
that
they
could
answer
every
question
and
plainly
failure
to
satisfy
a
questioner
might
be
disastrous
but
questions
could
be
written
and
replies
given
at
the
next
lecture
he
thought
smiling
that
some
of
them
would
perhaps
find
that
convenient
the
leaned
back
in
his
chair
well
sir
he
said
i
sorry
to
be
a
but
if
that
is
so
the
scheme
is
wrecked
from
the
start
you
do
know
the
men
i
do
they
not
going
to
line
up
like
the
pupils
of
dotheboys
academy
for
a
spoonful
of
brimstone
and
treacle
the
meeting
was
slightly
scandalised
the
chairman
however
rose
to
the
occasion
that
he
said
was
a
matter
for
they
were
there
to
do
their
duty
and
being
an
able
person
he
did
his
in
ten
minutes
they
were
formed
into
and
were
pledged
to
study
with
which
conclusion
the
meeting
adjourned
peter
was
almost
out
of
the
door
when
he
heard
his
name
called
and
turning
saw
the
beckoning
him
he
went
up
to
the
table
and
shook
hands
do
you
know
the
professor
asked
his
superior
professor
this
is
mr
graham
how
do
you
do
said
the
man
of
science
you
are
graham
of
balliol
are
you
you
read
political
science
and
economics
a
little
at
oxford
i
think
you
ought
to
be
the
very
man
for
us
especially
as
you
know
how
to
speak
peter
was
confused
but
being
human
a
little
flattered
he
confessed
to
the
sins
enumerated
and
waited
for
more
well
said
the
i
sent
in
your
name
already
graham
and
they
want
you
to
go
to
abbeville
for
a
few
weeks
a
gathering
is
to
be
made
there
of
the
more
promising
material
and
you
are
to
get
down
to
the
work
of
making
a
syllabus
and
so
on
you
will
meet
other
officers
from
all
branches
of
the
service
and
it
should
be
interesting
and
useful
i
presume
you
will
be
willing
to
go
of
course
it
is
entirely
optional
but
i
may
say
that
the
men
who
volunteer
will
not
be
forgotten
quite
so
said
the
professor
they
will
render
extremely
valuable
service
i
shall
hope
to
be
there
part
of
the
time
myself
peter
thought
quickly
of
a
number
of
things
as
one
does
at
such
a
moment
some
of
them
were
serious
things
and
some
quite
frivolous
like
julie
but
he
could
hardly
do
otherwise
than
consent
he
asked
when
he
should
have
to
go
in
a
few
days
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
ready
i
should
advise
you
to
write
for
some
books
and
begin
to
read
up
a
little
for
i
expect
you
are
a
bit
rusty
like
the
rest
of
us
and
i
shall
hope
to
have
you
back
lecturing
in
this
army
area
before
long
so
to
speak
bowed
out
peter
made
his
way
home
in
the
rue
de
paris
julie
passed
him
sitting
with
a
couple
of
other
nurses
in
an
ambulance
and
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
the
incident
served
to
depress
him
still
more
and
he
was
a
bit
petulant
as
he
entered
the
mess
he
flung
his
cap
on
the
table
and
threw
himself
into
a
chair
well
said
pennell
who
was
there
on
the
peg
all
right
do
be
a
fool
said
peter
sarcastically
i
wanted
on
the
staff
haig
ca
manage
without
me
i
got
to
leave
this
perishing
suburb
and
skip
up
to
and
do
you
forget
it
old
dear
i
shall
probably
be
a
before
you
get
your
third
pip
got
that
pennell
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
what
in
the
wind
now
he
demanded
well
you
might
not
have
noticed
it
but
i
a
political
and
economic
expert
and
haig
fed
up
that
you
boys
do
tumble
to
the
wisdom
of
the
centuries
as
you
ought
consequently
i
got
to
instruct
you
i
going
to
waltz
around
in
a
probably
with
tabs
up
and
lecture
and
there
are
to
be
any
questions
asked
for
that
subversive
of
discipline
good
lord
man
do
talk
sense
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
i
mean
jolly
well
what
i
say
if
you
want
to
know
or
something
precious
like
it
the
blinking
army
got
and
revolutionary
fever
and
we
may
all
be
murdered
in
our
little
beds
unless
i
put
a
shoulder
to
the
wheel
that
a
bit
mixed
but
it
stand
i
shall
be
churning
out
this
thing
by
the
yard
in
a
little
any
extra
pay
demanded
pennell
anxiously
i
can
lecture
on
engineering
and
would
do
for
an
extra
sixpence
whisky
going
up
and
i
have
paid
my
last
mess
bill
you
have
old
son
said
arnold
coming
in
and
you
jolly
well
got
to
here
a
letter
for
you
graham
peter
glanced
at
the
envelope
and
tore
it
open
pennell
knocked
his
pipe
out
with
feigned
dejection
the
fellow
makes
me
sick
padre
he
said
he
gets
every
hour
of
the
blessed
day
peter
jumped
up
excitedly
this
is
better
he
said
it
a
letter
from
langton
at
rouen
a
chap
i
met
there
who
writes
occasionally
he
been
hauled
in
for
this
stunt
himself
and
is
to
go
to
abbeville
as
well
by
jove
i
go
up
with
him
if
i
can
give
me
some
paper
somebody
have
to
write
to
him
at
once
or
we
boss
it
and
make
a
will
and
write
to
a
dozen
girls
i
should
think
said
pennell
i
do
know
what
the
blooming
army
coming
to
might
as
well
chuck
it
and
have
peace
i
think
but
meantime
i
got
to
leave
you
blighted
slackers
to
gad
about
the
place
and
go
and
do
an
honest
work
do
get
staff
jobs
and
red
tabs
no
i
help
win
the
ruddy
war
that
all
see
you
before
you
go
graham
i
suppose
they
likely
run
the
show
for
a
day
or
two
more
without
you
there
be
time
for
you
to
stand
a
dinner
on
the
strength
of
it
yet
a
week
later
peter
met
langton
by
appointment
in
the
rouen
club
the
two
of
them
being
booked
to
travel
that
evening
via
amiens
to
abbeville
his
tall
friend
was
drinking
a
in
the
and
talking
with
a
somewhat
bored
expression
to
no
less
a
person
than
jenks
of
the
peter
greeted
them
hullo
he
said
to
the
latter
fancy
meeting
you
here
again
do
say
you
going
to
lecture
as
well
the
good
god
preserve
us
exclaimed
jenks
blasphemously
but
i
am
off
in
your
train
to
boulogne
been
transferred
to
our
show
there
and
between
ourselves
i
not
sorry
to
go
it
a
decent
hole
in
some
ways
boulogne
and
it
time
i
got
out
of
rouen
you
a
lucky
man
padre
not
to
be
led
into
temptation
by
every
damned
girl
you
meet
i
do
know
what
they
see
in
me
he
continued
mournfully
and
at
this
hour
of
the
afternoon
i
do
know
what
i
see
in
them
nor
do
i
said
langton
have
a
drink
graham
there
be
no
getting
anything
on
the
ruddy
train
we
leave
at
and
get
in
somewhere
about
four
next
morning
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
you
do
sound
said
graham
i
not
i
fed
up
over
this
damned
lecture
stunt
the
condemned
to
failure
from
the
start
and
at
any
rate
it
no
time
for
it
fritz
means
more
by
this
push
than
the
idiots
about
here
allow
he
may
not
get
through
but
on
the
other
hand
he
may
if
he
does
it
up
with
us
all
and
here
we
are
to
go
lecturing
on
economics
and
industrial
problems
while
the
damned
house
is
on
fire
peter
took
his
drink
and
sat
down
what
your
particular
subject
he
asked
the
empire
colonies
south
africa
canada
and
why
because
i
took
a
degree
in
history
in
cambridge
and
have
done
surveying
on
the
lor
finish
that
drink
and
have
another
they
went
together
to
the
station
and
got
a
first
to
themselves
in
which
they
were
fortunate
they
spread
their
kit
about
the
place
suborned
an
official
to
warn
everyone
else
off
and
then
peter
and
langton
strolled
up
and
down
the
platform
for
half
an
hour
as
the
train
was
not
now
to
start
till
seven
somebody
told
them
there
was
a
row
on
up
the
line
though
it
was
not
plain
how
that
would
affect
them
jenks
departed
on
business
of
his
own
a
girl
lived
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
how
you
getting
on
now
padre
asked
langton
i
not
getting
on
said
peter
i
doing
my
job
as
best
i
can
and
i
seeing
all
there
is
to
see
but
i
more
in
a
fog
than
ever
i
got
a
hospital
at
havre
and
i
distribute
cigarettes
and
the
news
of
the
day
that
about
all
i
get
on
all
right
with
the
men
socially
and
now
and
again
i
meet
a
keen
nonconformist
who
wants
me
to
pray
with
him
or
an
anglican
who
wants
holy
communion
but
not
many
when
i
preach
i
rebuke
vice
as
the
apostle
says
but
i
hanged
if
i
really
know
why
langton
laughed
that
a
little
humorous
padre
he
said
what
about
the
ten
commandments
peter
thought
of
julie
he
kicked
a
stone
viciously
commandments
are
no
use
he
said
not
out
here
nor
anywhere
said
langton
nor
ever
i
think
too
why
do
you
suppose
i
keep
moderately
moral
chiefly
because
i
fear
natural
consequences
and
have
a
wife
and
kiddies
that
i
love
why
does
jenks
do
the
opposite
because
he
more
of
a
fool
or
less
of
a
coward
and
chiefly
loves
himself
that
all
and
that
all
there
is
in
it
for
most
of
us
you
do
fear
god
at
all
then
demanded
peter
oh
that
i
knew
where
i
might
find
him
quoted
langton
i
do
believe
he
thundered
on
sinai
at
any
rate
nor
spoke
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
ah
i
not
so
sure
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he
said
too
much
or
he
said
too
little
there
graham
one
ca
help
on
a
woman
occasionally
and
in
any
case
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
sermon
is
anything
like
the
commandments
brotherly
love
is
behind
the
first
fear
of
a
tribal
god
behind
the
second
so
far
as
i
can
see
christ
creed
was
to
love
and
to
go
on
loving
and
never
to
despair
of
love
love
according
to
him
was
stronger
than
hate
or
commandments
or
preaching
or
the
devil
himself
if
he
saved
souls
at
all
he
saved
them
by
loving
them
whatever
they
were
and
i
reckon
he
meant
us
to
do
the
same
what
do
you
make
of
the
woman
taken
in
adultery
and
the
woman
who
wiped
his
feet
with
her
hair
or
of
peter
or
of
judas
he
saved
peter
by
loving
him
when
he
thought
he
ought
to
have
the
ten
commandments
and
hell
fire
thrown
at
his
head
and
i
reckon
he
have
saved
judas
by
giving
him
that
of
love
if
he
had
had
a
soul
that
could
love
nothing
but
himself
what
is
love
langton
asked
peter
after
a
pause
the
other
looked
at
him
curiously
and
laughed
ask
the
bishops
he
said
do
ask
me
i
do
know
living
with
the
woman
to
whom
married
because
you
fear
to
leave
her
or
because
you
get
on
all
right
is
not
love
at
any
rate
i
ca
see
that
marriage
has
got
much
to
do
with
it
it
a
decent
convention
of
society
at
this
stage
of
development
perhaps
and
it
may
sign
and
seal
love
for
some
people
but
i
reckon
love
love
a
big
positive
thing
that
bigger
than
sin
and
bigger
than
the
devil
i
reckon
that
if
god
sees
that
anywhere
he
satisfied
i
do
think
cranmer
marriage
service
affects
him
much
nor
the
laws
of
the
state
if
a
man
cares
to
do
without
either
he
runs
a
risk
of
course
society
hard
on
a
woman
and
man
meant
to
be
a
gregarious
creature
but
that
all
there
is
in
it
but
how
can
you
tell
lust
from
love
demanded
peter
you
ca
i
think
said
langton
most
men
ca
anyway
women
may
do
but
i
do
know
i
reckon
that
what
they
lust
after
mostly
is
babies
and
a
home
i
do
think
they
know
it
any
more
than
men
know
that
what
they
after
is
the
gratification
of
a
passion
but
there
it
is
sewer
rats
crawling
up
a
damned
long
drain
if
you
ask
me
padre
i
know
who
said
it
but
it
true
they
turned
in
their
walk
and
peter
looked
out
over
the
old
town
in
the
glow
of
sunset
the
thin
iron
modern
spire
of
the
cathedral
had
a
grace
not
its
own
and
the
roofs
below
it
showed
strong
and
almost
sentient
one
could
imagine
that
the
distant
cathedral
brooding
over
the
city
heard
saw
and
spoke
if
in
another
language
than
the
language
of
men
if
that
were
all
langton
said
peter
suddenly
i
shoot
myself
you
a
queer
fellow
graham
said
langton
i
almost
think
you
might
i
like
to
know
what
becomes
of
you
anyway
forgive
me
i
do
mean
to
be
rude
but
you
may
make
a
parson
yet
but
do
found
a
new
religion
for
heaven
sake
and
do
muddle
up
laws
and
instincts
if
they
are
he
added
peter
said
nothing
until
they
were
waiting
at
the
for
jenks
then
he
said
then
you
think
out
here
men
have
simply
abandoned
conventions
and
because
there
is
no
authority
or
fear
or
faith
left
to
them
they
do
as
they
please
langton
settled
himself
in
a
corner
yes
he
said
that
right
in
a
way
but
that
negatively
i
go
farther
than
that
of
course
there
are
a
lot
of
judas
iscariots
about
for
whom
i
should
imagine
the
devil
himself
has
much
time
though
i
suppose
we
ought
not
to
judge
but
there
are
also
a
lot
of
fine
fellows
and
fine
women
they
are
men
and
women
if
i
understand
it
who
have
sloughed
off
the
conventions
that
are
conventions
simply
for
convention
sake
and
who
are
reaching
out
towards
the
realities
most
of
them
have
an
idea
what
those
are
but
dumbly
they
know
tommy
knows
for
instance
who
is
a
good
chum
and
who
is
that
is
he
knows
that
sincerity
and
unselfishness
and
pluck
are
realities
he
does
care
a
damn
if
a
chap
drinks
and
swears
and
commits
what
the
and
the
call
fornication
and
he
certainly
does
think
there
is
an
ascending
scale
of
sins
or
at
any
rate
that
you
parsons
have
got
the
scale
right
i
should
be
surprised
if
we
have
said
peter
the
bible
lumps
liars
and
drunkards
and
murderers
and
adulterers
and
dogs
whatever
that
may
mean
into
hell
altogether
that
so
said
langton
sticking
a
candle
on
the
but
i
reckon
that
not
so
much
because
they
lie
or
drink
or
murder
or
lust
or
or
grin
about
the
city
like
our
friend
jenks
who
likely
miss
the
boat
for
that
very
reason
but
because
of
something
else
they
all
have
in
common
what
that
demanded
peter
i
have
the
faintest
idea
said
langton
at
this
moment
the
french
guard
an
and
jenks
appeared
in
sight
simultaneously
the
two
former
urging
the
latter
along
he
caught
sight
of
them
and
waved
help
him
in
said
the
a
subaltern
genially
and
keep
him
there
he
added
under
his
voice
he
had
all
he
can
carry
and
if
he
gets
loose
again
be
for
the
high
jump
the
wonder
is
he
ever
got
back
in
time
peter
helped
him
up
the
subaltern
glanced
at
his
badges
and
smiled
he
in
good
company
anyway
padre
he
said
if
you
leaving
the
in
the
wilderness
here
one
to
bring
home
rejoicing
he
slammed
the
door
he
said
to
the
guard
they
all
aboard
now
the
man
comprehended
the
action
and
waved
a
flag
the
train
started
after
the
manner
of
french
trains
told
off
for
the
use
of
british
soldiers
and
jenks
collapsed
on
the
seat
damned
near
thing
that
he
said
unsteadily
might
have
missed
the
bloody
boat
i
saw
my
little
bit
though
she
a
jolly
good
sort
she
is
blasted
strong
stuff
that
french
brandy
though
whiskies
at
the
club
first
yer
know
give
us
a
hand
padre
i
reckon
i
just
lie
down
a
bit
jolly
good
sort
of
padre
eh
skipper
what
peter
helped
him
into
his
place
and
then
came
and
sat
at
his
feet
opposite
langton
who
smiled
askance
at
him
i
read
a
bit
he
said
jenks
wo
trouble
us
further
he
sleep
it
off
i
know
his
sort
got
a
book
padre
peter
said
he
had
but
that
he
would
read
for
a
little
and
he
sat
still
looking
at
the
country
as
they
jolted
past
in
the
dusk
after
a
while
langton
lit
his
candle
and
contrived
a
for
the
centre
window
was
broken
of
a
newspaper
peter
watched
him
drowsily
he
had
been
up
early
and
travelled
already
that
day
the
motion
helped
too
and
in
half
an
hour
or
so
he
was
asleep
he
dreamt
that
he
was
preaching
langton
views
on
the
sermon
on
the
mount
in
the
pulpit
of
john
and
that
the
canon
from
his
place
beside
the
within
the
was
shouting
at
him
to
stop
in
his
dream
he
persisted
however
until
that
irate
dignitary
seized
the
famous
and
massive
by
his
side
and
hurled
it
in
the
direction
of
the
pulpit
the
clatter
that
it
made
on
the
stone
floor
awoke
him
he
was
first
aware
that
the
train
was
no
longer
in
motion
and
next
that
langton
tall
form
was
leaning
half
out
of
the
window
then
confused
noises
penetrated
his
consciousness
and
he
perceived
that
light
flickered
in
the
otherwise
darkened
compartment
where
are
we
he
demanded
now
fully
awake
what
up
langton
answered
over
his
shoulder
some
where
outside
of
a
biggish
town
he
said
and
there
the
devil
of
a
strafe
on
the
whole
lit
up
but
that
may
be
twenty
miles
off
however
fritz
must
have
advanced
some
he
was
interrupted
by
a
series
of
much
louder
explosions
and
the
rattle
of
fire
that
near
he
said
over
the
town
i
should
say
an
though
it
may
be
firing
come
and
see
for
yourself
he
pulled
himself
back
into
the
carriage
and
peter
leaned
out
of
the
window
in
his
turn
it
was
as
the
other
had
said
flares
and
sudden
flashes
that
came
and
went
more
like
than
anything
else
lit
up
the
whole
but
nearer
at
hand
a
steady
glow
from
one
or
two
places
showed
in
the
sky
one
could
distinguish
flights
of
illuminated
tracer
bullets
and
now
and
again
what
he
took
to
be
very
lights
exposed
the
countryside
peter
saw
that
they
were
in
a
siding
the
banks
of
which
reached
just
above
the
top
of
the
compartments
it
was
only
by
craning
that
he
could
see
fields
and
what
looked
like
a
house
beyond
men
were
leaning
out
of
all
the
windows
mostly
in
silence
in
the
compartment
next
them
a
man
cursed
the
huns
for
spoiling
his
beauty
sleep
it
was
slightly
overdone
peter
thought
good
god
said
his
companion
behind
him
listen
it
was
difficult
but
between
the
louder
explosions
peter
concentrated
his
senses
on
listening
in
a
minute
he
heard
something
new
a
faint
buzz
in
the
air
aeroplanes
said
langton
coolly
i
hope
they
do
spot
us
let
me
see
maybe
it
our
planes
he
craned
out
in
peter
place
i
ca
see
anything
he
said
and
you
can
hear
they
flying
high
down
the
train
everyone
was
staring
upwards
now
christ
exclaimed
langton
suddenly
some
fool
lighting
a
pipe
put
that
match
out
there
he
called
other
voices
took
him
up
that
better
he
said
in
a
minute
forgive
my
swearing
padre
but
a
match
might
give
us
away
peter
was
silent
and
truth
to
tell
terrified
he
tried
hard
not
to
feel
it
and
glanced
at
jenks
he
was
still
asleep
and
breathing
heavily
he
pressed
his
face
against
the
pane
and
tried
to
stare
up
too
they
coming
said
langton
suddenly
and
quickly
there
they
are
too
hun
planes
they
may
not
see
us
of
course
but
they
may
he
brought
his
head
in
again
and
sat
down
is
there
anything
we
can
do
said
peter
nothing
said
langton
unless
you
like
to
get
under
the
seat
but
that
no
real
good
it
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
padre
whatever
gods
there
be
just
then
peter
saw
one
sailing
obliquely
towards
them
and
lit
by
the
light
of
a
flare
the
plane
looked
serene
and
beautiful
he
watched
it
fascinated
it
very
low
two
hundred
feet
i
should
say
said
langton
behind
him
hope
he
no
pills
left
i
wonder
whether
there
another
let
have
a
look
the
other
side
he
had
scarcely
got
up
to
cross
the
compartment
when
the
rattle
of
a
very
near
broke
out
our
fellows
likely
he
exclaimed
excitedly
struggling
with
the
sash
but
they
knew
the
truth
almost
as
he
spoke
langton
ducked
back
a
plane
on
the
other
side
was
deliberately
flying
up
the
train
down
padre
for
god
sake
he
exclaimed
and
threw
himself
on
the
floor
peter
could
move
he
heard
the
splintering
of
glass
and
a
rending
of
woodwork
some
oaths
and
a
sudden
cry
the
whirr
of
an
engine
filled
his
ears
and
seemed
as
it
were
on
top
of
them
then
there
was
a
crash
all
but
at
his
side
and
next
instant
a
groan
and
a
dreadful
gasp
for
breath
he
could
speak
he
heard
langton
say
hit
anyone
and
then
they
got
me
skipper
in
a
muffled
whisper
and
he
noticed
that
the
hard
breathing
had
ceased
at
that
he
found
strength
and
voice
and
jumped
up
he
bent
over
jenks
where
have
you
got
it
old
man
he
said
and
hardly
realised
that
it
was
himself
speaking
the
other
was
lying
just
as
before
on
his
back
but
he
had
pulled
his
knees
up
convulsively
and
a
rug
had
slipped
off
in
a
flare
peter
saw
beads
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
and
a
white
twisted
face
he
choked
back
panic
and
knelt
down
he
had
imagined
it
all
before
and
yet
not
quite
like
this
he
knew
what
he
ought
to
say
but
for
a
minute
he
could
not
formulate
it
where
are
you
hit
jenks
was
all
he
said
the
other
turned
his
head
a
little
and
looked
at
him
body
lungs
i
think
he
whispered
i
done
padre
i
seen
chaps
before
the
words
trailed
off
peter
gripped
himself
mentally
and
steadied
his
voice
jenks
old
man
he
said
just
a
minute
think
about
god
you
are
going
to
him
you
know
trust
him
will
you
blood
of
jesus
christ
god
son
saveth
us
from
all
sin
the
dying
man
moved
his
hand
convulsively
do
you
worry
padre
he
said
faintly
i
been
confirmed
the
lips
tightened
a
second
with
pain
and
then
reckon
i
wo
shirk
have
you
got
a
cigarette
peter
felt
quickly
for
his
case
fumbled
and
dropped
one
then
got
another
into
his
fingers
he
hesitated
a
second
and
then
put
it
to
his
own
lips
struck
a
match
and
puffed
at
it
he
was
in
the
act
of
holding
it
to
the
other
when
langton
spoke
behind
him
it
no
good
now
padre
he
said
quietly
it
all
over
and
peter
saw
that
it
was
the
planes
did
not
come
back
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
train
came
down
it
with
a
lantern
and
looked
in
that
makes
three
he
said
we
can
do
nothing
now
but
we
be
in
the
station
in
a
bit
do
show
any
lights
they
may
come
back
where
the
hell
were
our
machines
i
like
to
know
he
went
on
and
peter
sat
down
in
his
corner
langton
picked
up
the
rug
and
covered
up
the
body
then
he
glanced
at
peter
here
he
said
holding
out
a
flask
have
some
of
this
peter
shook
his
head
langton
came
over
to
him
you
must
he
said
it
pull
you
together
do
go
under
now
graham
you
kept
your
nerve
just
now
come
on
at
that
peter
took
it
and
drained
the
little
cup
the
other
poured
out
for
him
then
he
handed
it
back
without
a
word
feel
better
queried
the
other
a
trifle
curiously
staring
at
him
yes
thanks
said
peter
a
damned
sight
better
poor
old
jenks
what
blasted
luck
that
he
should
have
got
it
langton
i
wish
to
god
it
had
been
me
part
ii
and
the
lord
turned
and
looked
upon
peter
luke
gospel
chapter
i
the
charm
of
the
little
towns
of
northern
france
is
very
difficult
to
imprison
on
paper
it
is
not
exactly
that
they
are
old
although
there
is
scarcely
one
which
has
not
a
church
or
a
château
or
a
quaint
medieval
street
worth
coming
far
to
see
nor
that
they
are
particularly
picturesque
for
the
ground
is
fairly
flat
and
they
are
all
but
always
set
among
the
fields
since
it
is
by
agriculture
far
more
than
by
manufacture
that
they
live
but
they
are
clean
and
cheerful
one
thinks
of
them
under
the
sun
and
they
are
very
homely
in
them
the
folk
smile
simply
at
you
but
not
inquisitively
as
in
england
for
each
bustles
gaily
about
his
own
affairs
and
will
let
you
do
what
you
please
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
abbeville
is
very
typical
of
all
this
it
has
its
church
and
from
the
bridge
over
the
somme
the
backs
of
ancient
houses
can
be
seen
leaning
half
over
the
river
which
has
sung
beneath
them
for
five
hundred
years
and
it
is
set
in
the
midst
of
memories
of
stirring
days
yet
it
is
not
for
these
that
one
would
revisit
the
little
town
but
rather
that
one
might
walk
by
the
still
canal
under
the
high
trees
in
spring
or
loiter
in
the
round
what
the
hun
has
left
of
the
statue
of
the
famous
admiral
with
his
attendant
nymphs
or
wander
down
the
winding
streets
that
skirt
the
ancient
church
and
give
glimpses
of
its
unfinished
tower
peter
found
it
very
good
to
be
there
in
the
days
that
followed
the
death
of
jenks
true
it
was
now
nearer
to
the
seat
of
war
than
it
had
been
for
years
and
began
to
be
common
but
in
a
sense
the
sound
of
the
guns
fitted
in
with
his
mood
so
great
a
battle
was
being
fought
within
him
that
the
world
could
not
in
any
case
have
seemed
wholly
at
peace
and
yet
in
the
quiet
fields
or
sauntering
of
an
afternoon
by
the
river
he
found
it
easier
than
at
havre
to
think
langton
was
almost
his
sole
companion
and
a
considerable
intimacy
had
grown
up
between
them
peter
found
that
his
friend
seemed
to
understand
a
great
deal
of
his
thoughts
without
explanation
he
neither
condoled
nor
exhorted
rather
he
watched
with
an
almost
shy
interest
the
other
inward
battle
they
lodged
at
the
hôtel
de
that
hostelry
in
the
street
that
leads
up
and
out
of
the
town
towards
saint
riquier
which
you
enter
from
a
courtyard
that
opens
on
the
road
and
has
rooms
that
you
reach
by
means
of
narrow
rickety
flights
of
stairs
and
balconies
overhanging
the
court
the
big
wore
an
air
of
gloomy
festivity
its
chandeliers
swathed
in
brown
paper
its
faded
paint
and
its
covered
upholstery
suggested
that
it
awaited
a
day
yet
to
be
when
it
should
blossom
forth
once
more
in
glory
as
in
the
days
of
old
till
then
it
was
as
merry
as
it
could
be
its
little
tables
filled
up
of
an
evening
with
the
new
cosmopolitan
population
of
the
town
and
old
jacques
bustled
round
with
the
good
wine
and
dropped
no
hint
that
the
choice
brands
were
nearly
at
an
end
in
the
cellar
peter
and
langton
would
have
their
apology
for
in
bed
or
alone
peter
as
a
rule
was
up
early
and
used
to
wander
out
a
little
and
sometimes
into
church
coming
back
to
coffee
as
good
as
ever
but
bread
instead
of
rolls
on
a
small
table
under
a
low
balcony
in
the
courtyard
if
it
were
fine
he
would
linger
over
it
and
have
chance
conversation
with
passing
strangers
of
all
sorts
from
clerical
personages
belonging
to
the
church
army
or
the
to
officers
who
came
and
went
usually
on
unrevealed
affairs
then
langton
would
come
down
and
they
would
stroll
round
to
the
office
which
had
been
prepared
for
the
lecture
campaign
and
glance
at
maps
of
districts
and
exchange
news
with
the
officer
in
charge
who
having
done
all
he
could
had
now
nothing
to
do
but
stand
by
and
wait
for
the
next
move
from
a
war
office
that
had
either
forgotten
his
existence
or
discovered
some
hitch
in
its
plans
they
had
a
couple
of
lectures
from
people
who
were
alleged
to
know
all
about
such
topics
as
the
food
shortage
at
home
or
the
new
plans
for
housing
but
who
invariably
turned
out
to
be
waiting
themselves
for
the
precise
information
that
was
necessary
for
successful
lectures
after
such
they
would
stroll
out
through
the
town
into
the
fields
and
langton
would
criticise
the
thing
in
lurid
but
humorous
language
and
they
would
come
back
to
the
club
and
sit
or
read
till
lunch
the
club
was
one
of
the
best
in
france
it
was
an
old
house
with
lovely
furniture
and
not
too
much
of
it
which
stood
well
back
from
the
street
and
boasted
an
garden
of
shady
trees
and
spring
flowers
and
green
lawns
peter
could
both
read
and
write
in
its
rooms
and
it
was
there
that
he
finally
wrote
to
hilda
but
not
until
after
much
thought
after
his
day
with
julie
at
caudebec
one
might
have
supposed
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
break
off
his
engagement
to
hilda
but
it
did
not
strike
him
so
for
one
thing
he
was
not
engaged
to
julie
or
anything
like
it
and
he
could
not
imagine
such
a
situation
even
if
julie
had
not
positively
repudiated
any
desire
to
be
either
engaged
or
married
he
had
certainly
declared
in
a
fit
of
enthusiasm
that
he
loved
her
but
he
had
not
asked
if
she
loved
him
he
had
seen
her
since
but
although
they
were
very
good
friends
nothing
more
exciting
had
passed
between
them
peter
was
conscious
that
when
he
was
with
julie
she
fascinated
him
but
that
when
he
was
away
ah
that
was
it
when
he
was
away
it
certainly
was
not
that
hilda
came
back
and
took
her
place
it
was
rather
that
the
other
things
in
his
mind
dominated
him
it
was
a
curious
state
of
affairs
he
was
less
like
an
orthodox
parson
than
he
had
ever
been
and
yet
he
had
never
thought
so
much
about
religion
he
agonised
over
it
now
at
times
his
thoughts
were
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
it
came
then
to
this
that
he
had
not
so
much
changed
towards
hilda
as
changed
towards
life
whether
he
had
really
fundamentally
changed
in
such
a
way
that
a
break
with
the
old
was
inevitable
he
did
not
know
till
then
hilda
was
part
of
the
old
and
if
he
went
back
to
it
she
naturally
took
her
old
place
in
it
if
he
did
not
well
there
he
invariably
came
to
the
end
of
thought
curiously
enough
it
was
when
faced
with
a
mental
blank
that
julie
image
began
to
rise
in
his
mind
if
he
admitted
her
he
found
himself
abandoning
himself
to
her
he
felt
sometimes
that
if
he
could
but
take
her
in
his
arms
he
could
let
the
world
go
by
and
god
with
it
her
kisses
were
at
least
a
reality
there
was
neither
convention
nor
subterfuge
nor
divided
allegiance
there
she
was
passion
naked
and
unashamed
and
at
least
real
and
then
he
would
remember
that
much
of
this
was
problematical
after
all
for
they
had
never
kissed
as
that
passion
demanded
or
at
least
that
he
had
never
so
kissed
her
he
was
not
sure
of
the
first
he
knew
that
he
did
not
understand
julie
but
he
felt
if
he
did
kiss
her
it
would
be
a
kiss
of
surrender
of
finality
he
feared
to
look
beyond
that
and
he
could
not
if
he
would
he
wrote
then
to
hilda
and
he
told
of
the
death
of
jenks
and
of
their
arrival
in
abbeville
you
must
understand
dear
he
said
that
all
this
has
had
a
tremendous
effect
upon
me
in
that
train
all
that
i
had
begun
to
feel
about
the
uselessness
of
my
old
religion
came
to
a
head
i
could
do
no
more
for
that
soul
than
light
a
cigarette
possibly
no
one
could
have
done
any
more
but
i
can
not
i
will
not
believe
it
jenks
was
not
fundamentally
evil
or
at
least
i
do
think
so
he
was
rather
a
selfish
fool
who
had
no
control
that
is
all
he
did
not
serve
the
devil
it
was
much
more
that
he
had
never
seen
any
master
to
serve
and
i
could
do
nothing
i
had
no
master
to
show
him
you
may
say
that
that
is
absurd
that
christ
is
my
master
and
i
could
have
shown
him
hilda
so
he
is
i
cling
passionately
to
that
but
listen
i
ca
express
him
i
do
understand
him
i
no
longer
feel
that
he
was
animating
and
ordering
the
form
of
religion
i
administered
it
is
not
that
i
feel
anglicanism
to
be
untrue
and
something
else
say
wesleyanism
to
be
true
it
is
much
more
that
i
feel
them
all
to
be
out
of
touch
with
reality
it
i
do
think
you
can
possibly
see
it
but
that
is
the
main
trouble
that
too
brings
me
to
my
next
point
and
this
i
find
harder
still
to
express
i
want
you
to
realise
that
i
feel
as
if
i
had
never
seen
life
before
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
shown
all
my
days
a
certain
number
of
pictures
and
told
that
they
were
the
real
thing
or
given
certain
descriptions
and
told
that
they
were
true
i
had
always
accepted
that
they
were
but
hilda
they
are
not
wickedness
is
not
wicked
in
the
way
that
i
was
told
it
was
wicked
and
what
i
was
told
was
salvation
is
not
the
salvation
men
and
women
want
i
have
been
playing
in
a
paradise
all
these
years
and
i
got
outside
the
gate
i
am
distressed
and
terrified
i
think
but
underneath
it
all
i
am
very
glad
you
will
say
are
you
going
to
do
and
i
can
only
reply
i
know
i
not
going
to
make
any
vast
change
if
you
mean
that
a
padre
i
am
and
a
padre
i
shall
stay
for
the
war
at
least
and
none
of
us
can
see
beyond
that
at
present
but
what
i
do
mean
to
do
is
just
this
i
mean
to
try
and
get
down
to
reality
myself
and
try
to
weigh
it
up
i
am
going
to
eat
and
drink
with
publicans
and
sinners
maybe
i
shall
find
my
master
still
there
peter
stopped
and
looked
up
langton
was
stretched
out
in
a
chair
beside
him
reading
a
novel
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
moved
by
an
impulse
he
interrupted
him
old
man
he
said
i
want
you
to
let
me
read
you
a
bit
of
this
letter
it
to
my
girl
but
there
nothing
rotten
in
reading
it
may
i
langton
did
not
move
carry
on
he
said
shortly
peter
finished
and
put
down
the
sheet
the
other
smoked
placidly
and
said
nothing
well
demanded
peter
impatiently
i
should
cut
out
that
last
sentence
pronounced
the
judge
why
it
true
maybe
but
it
is
pretty
langton
burst
out
peter
i
sick
of
prettinesses
i
been
stuffed
up
with
them
all
my
life
and
so
has
she
i
want
to
break
with
them
very
likely
and
i
do
say
that
it
wo
be
the
best
thing
for
you
to
try
for
a
little
to
do
so
but
she
has
been
where
you
been
or
seen
what
you
seen
you
ca
expect
her
wholly
to
understand
and
more
than
that
maybe
she
is
meant
for
prettinesses
after
all
pretty
peter
stabbed
the
with
his
pen
then
she
is
meant
for
me
he
said
i
not
so
sure
said
langton
i
do
know
that
you
stuff
enough
in
you
to
get
on
without
those
same
prettinesses
yourself
most
of
us
have
and
at
any
rate
i
would
burn
my
boats
yet
awhile
you
may
want
to
escape
yet
peter
considered
this
in
silence
then
he
drew
the
sheets
to
him
and
added
a
few
more
words
folded
the
paper
put
it
in
the
envelope
and
stuck
it
down
come
on
he
said
let
go
and
post
this
and
have
a
walk
langton
got
up
and
looked
at
him
curiously
as
he
sometimes
did
peter
he
said
you
a
weird
blighter
but
there
something
damned
gritty
in
you
you
take
life
too
strenuously
why
ca
you
saunter
through
it
like
i
do
peter
reached
for
this
cap
come
on
he
said
again
and
do
talk
rot
out
in
the
street
they
strolled
aimlessly
on
more
or
less
in
silence
the
big
at
the
corner
detained
them
for
a
little
and
they
regarded
its
variegated
contents
through
the
glass
it
contained
a
few
good
prints
and
many
more
poorly
executed
coloured
pictures
of
ruined
places
in
france
and
belgium
of
which
a
few
however
were
not
bad
cheek
by
jowl
with
some
religious
works
a
statue
of
notre
dame
and
some
more
of
jeanne
were
a
line
of
pornographic
novels
and
beyond
packets
of
picture
entitled
le
bain
de
la
parisienne
les
seins
des
and
so
on
then
langton
drew
attention
to
one
or
two
other
books
one
of
which
had
a
gaudy
cover
representing
a
mistress
with
a
in
her
hands
and
a
number
of
canes
hung
up
beside
her
while
a
girl
of
fifteen
or
so
with
very
red
cheeks
was
apparently
about
to
be
whipped
good
lord
said
langton
the
french
are
beyond
me
this
window
is
a
study
for
you
graham
in
itself
i
should
take
it
that
it
means
that
there
is
nothing
real
in
life
it
is
utterly
cynical
if
the
wine
you
drink
the
lip
you
press
end
in
what
all
begins
and
ends
in
yes
think
then
you
are
what
yesterday
you
were
you
shall
not
be
less
he
quoted
yes
said
peter
or
else
it
means
that
there
are
only
two
realities
and
that
the
excellent
person
who
keeps
this
establishment
regards
both
in
a
detached
way
and
conceives
it
her
business
to
cater
for
each
go
on
they
turned
the
corner
and
presently
found
themselves
outside
the
famous
carven
door
of
the
church
have
you
ever
been
round
asked
peter
no
said
langton
let
go
in
they
passed
through
the
door
into
the
old
church
which
in
contrast
to
that
at
le
havre
was
bathed
in
the
daylight
that
streamed
through
many
clear
windows
together
they
wandered
round
it
saying
little
they
inspected
an
statue
of
roch
who
was
pulling
up
his
robe
to
expose
a
wound
and
looking
upwards
at
the
same
time
seraphically
or
at
least
after
the
manner
that
the
artist
of
that
age
had
regarded
as
seraphic
a
number
of
white
ribbons
and
some
wax
figures
of
feet
and
hands
and
other
parts
of
the
body
were
tied
to
him
they
stood
before
a
wonderful
coloured
alabaster
reredos
of
the
fourteenth
century
in
which
shepherds
and
kings
and
beasts
came
to
worship
at
the
manger
they
had
a
little
conversation
as
to
the
architectural
periods
of
the
nave
choir
and
transepts
and
langton
was
enthusiastic
over
a
noble
pillar
and
arch
beyond
they
gazed
in
silence
at
a
statue
of
our
lady
immaculate
in
modern
coloured
plaster
so
arranged
that
the
daylight
fell
through
an
unseen
opening
upon
her
among
the
objects
in
front
were
a
pair
of
renaissance
candlesticks
of
great
beauty
a
french
officer
came
up
and
arranged
and
lit
a
votive
candle
as
they
watched
and
then
went
back
to
stand
in
silence
by
a
pillar
the
church
door
banged
and
two
peasants
came
in
one
obviously
from
the
market
with
a
huge
basket
of
carrots
and
cabbages
and
some
long
thin
french
loaves
she
deposited
this
just
inside
the
door
took
holy
water
clattered
up
towards
the
high
altar
dropped
a
curtsy
and
made
her
way
to
an
altar
of
the
sacred
heart
at
which
she
knelt
peter
sighed
come
on
he
said
get
out
langton
marched
on
before
him
and
held
the
door
back
as
they
stepped
into
the
street
well
philosopher
he
demanded
what
do
you
make
of
that
peter
smiled
what
do
you
he
said
well
said
langton
it
leaves
me
unmoved
except
when
i
annoyed
by
the
way
their
wretched
images
spoil
the
church
but
it
is
plain
that
they
like
it
i
should
say
one
of
your
two
realities
is
there
but
i
find
it
hard
to
forgive
the
bad
art
do
you
said
peter
i
do
it
reminds
me
of
those
appalling
enlargements
of
family
groups
that
you
see
for
example
in
any
yorkshire
cottage
they
are
unutterably
hideous
but
they
stand
for
a
real
thing
that
is
honest
and
beautiful
the
love
of
home
and
family
and
by
the
same
token
when
the
photographs
got
exchanged
as
they
do
in
mayfair
for
modern
french
pictures
of
nude
women
or
some
incredible
futurist
extravagance
that
love
has
usually
flown
out
of
the
window
humph
said
langton
not
always
besides
why
ca
a
family
group
be
made
artistically
and
so
keep
both
art
and
love
i
should
think
we
ought
to
aim
at
that
i
suppose
we
ought
said
peter
but
in
our
age
the
two
do
seem
to
go
together
goodness
alone
knows
why
why
hullo
he
broke
off
what
up
now
demanded
langton
why
there
across
the
street
if
that
is
a
nurse
i
know
from
havre
i
do
know
who
it
is
wait
a
tick
he
crossed
the
road
and
saw
as
he
got
near
that
it
was
indeed
julie
he
came
up
behind
her
as
she
examined
a
by
all
wonderful
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
she
turned
quickly
her
eyes
dancing
i
wondered
if
i
should
meet
you
she
said
you
see
your
letter
told
me
you
were
coming
here
but
i
have
heard
from
you
since
you
came
and
i
did
know
if
you
had
started
your
tour
or
not
came
simply
enough
there
a
big
south
african
hospital
here
and
we
had
to
send
up
a
batch
of
men
by
motor
as
they
knew
i
was
from
south
africa
they
gave
me
the
chance
to
come
with
them
well
i
glad
said
peter
devouring
the
sight
of
her
wait
a
minute
i
must
introduce
you
to
langton
he
and
i
are
together
and
a
jolly
good
chap
he
turned
and
beckoned
langton
who
came
over
and
was
introduced
they
walked
up
the
street
a
little
way
together
where
are
you
going
now
asked
peter
back
to
the
hospital
said
julie
a
car
starts
from
the
square
at
and
i
have
to
be
in
for
lunch
have
you
much
to
do
up
there
asked
peter
oh
no
she
said
my
job
done
i
clear
off
the
day
after
we
only
got
in
last
night
so
i
get
a
couple
of
days
holiday
what
are
you
doing
you
do
look
any
too
busy
peter
glanced
across
at
langton
and
laughed
we
are
he
said
the
whole
stunt
a
if
you
ask
me
and
we
really
expecting
to
be
sent
back
any
day
there
too
much
doing
now
for
lectures
is
the
hospital
full
packed
said
julie
gravely
the
papers
say
we
falling
back
steadily
so
as
not
to
lose
men
but
the
facts
do
bear
it
out
we
crammed
out
it
ghastly
i
never
known
it
so
bad
peter
had
hardly
ever
seen
her
grave
before
and
her
face
showed
a
new
aspect
of
her
he
felt
a
glow
of
warmth
steal
over
him
i
say
he
said
could
you
dine
with
us
we
at
the
angleterre
and
its
tremendously
respectable
she
laughed
her
gravity
vanishing
in
a
minute
i
must
say
she
said
that
i
love
to
see
you
anywhere
really
respectable
he
a
terrible
person
for
a
padre
do
you
think
so
captain
langton
terrible
said
langton
but
really
the
angleterre
is
quite
proper
you
do
get
any
too
bad
a
dinner
either
do
come
miss
gamelyn
she
appeared
to
consider
i
might
manage
it
she
said
at
last
stopping
just
short
of
entering
the
square
but
i
have
the
nerve
to
burst
in
and
ask
for
you
nor
will
it
do
for
you
to
see
me
all
the
way
to
that
car
or
we
shall
have
a
dozen
girls
talking
if
you
will
meet
me
somewhere
she
added
looking
at
peter
i
risk
it
i
have
a
headache
and
not
go
to
first
dinner
then
the
first
will
think
i
at
the
second
and
the
second
at
the
first
besides
i
no
duty
and
the
hospital
not
like
havre
it
all
spread
out
in
huts
and
tents
and
it
easy
enough
to
get
in
last
but
not
least
it
colonial
and
the
matron
is
a
brick
yes
i
come
hurrah
said
peter
i
tell
you
what
i
meet
you
at
the
below
the
hospital
and
bring
you
on
will
that
do
what
time
heavens
do
you
dine
at
demanded
julie
well
not
quite
but
we
got
to
get
down
said
peter
laughing
all
right
said
julie
and
the
saints
preserve
us
look
here
i
shall
chance
it
and
come
in
mufti
if
possible
no
one
knows
me
here
splendid
said
peter
said
langton
we
go
and
arrange
our
menu
there
must
be
champagne
called
julie
merrily
over
her
shoulder
and
catching
his
eye
the
two
men
watched
her
make
for
the
car
across
the
sunlit
square
then
they
strolled
round
it
towards
a
café
come
on
said
langton
have
an
appetiser
from
the
little
table
peter
watched
the
car
drive
away
julie
was
laughing
over
something
with
another
girl
it
seemed
to
conclude
the
morning
somehow
he
raised
his
glass
and
looked
at
langton
well
he
said
here
to
reality
wherever
it
is
and
here
to
getting
along
without
too
much
of
it
said
langton
smiling
at
him
the
dinner
was
a
great
success
at
least
in
the
beginning
julie
wore
a
frock
of
some
soft
brown
stuff
and
peter
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
off
her
he
had
never
seen
her
out
of
uniform
before
and
although
she
was
gay
enough
she
said
and
did
nothing
very
exciting
if
hilda
had
been
there
she
need
hardly
have
behaved
differently
and
for
a
while
peter
was
wholly
delighted
then
it
began
to
dawn
on
him
that
she
was
playing
up
to
langton
and
that
set
in
train
irritating
thoughts
he
watched
the
other
jealously
and
noticed
how
the
girl
drew
him
out
to
speak
of
his
travels
and
how
excellently
he
did
it
leaning
back
at
coffee
with
his
cigarette
polite
pleasant
attractive
julie
who
usually
smoked
cigarette
after
cigarette
furiously
only
however
getting
through
about
half
of
each
now
refused
a
second
and
glanced
at
the
clock
about
oh
she
said
i
must
go
peter
remonstrated
if
you
can
stay
out
later
at
havre
he
said
why
not
here
she
laughed
lightly
i
reforming
she
said
in
the
absence
of
bad
companions
besides
they
are
used
to
my
being
later
at
havre
but
here
i
might
be
spotted
and
then
there
would
be
trouble
would
you
fetch
my
coat
captain
graham
peter
went
obediently
and
they
all
three
moved
out
into
the
court
come
along
and
see
her
home
langton
he
said
though
he
hardly
knew
why
he
included
the
other
thanks
said
his
friend
but
if
miss
gamelyn
will
excuse
me
i
ought
not
i
got
some
reading
i
must
do
for
and
i
want
to
write
a
letter
or
two
as
well
you
be
an
admirable
escort
graham
said
julie
holding
out
her
hand
perhaps
we
shall
meet
again
some
time
one
is
always
running
up
against
people
in
france
and
thank
you
so
much
for
your
share
of
the
entertainment
in
a
few
seconds
peter
and
she
were
outside
the
street
was
much
darkened
and
there
was
no
moon
they
walked
in
silence
for
a
little
suddenly
he
stopped
would
you
like
a
cab
he
said
we
might
be
able
to
get
one
julie
laughed
mischievously
and
peter
gave
a
little
start
in
the
dark
it
struck
him
that
this
was
the
old
laugh
and
that
he
had
not
heard
it
that
night
before
it
convenient
of
course
she
said
mockingly
do
get
one
by
all
means
but
last
time
i
came
home
with
you
in
a
cab
you
let
me
finish
alone
i
thought
that
was
to
be
an
invariable
rule
oh
do
julie
said
peter
her
tone
changed
why
not
she
demanded
solomon
what
made
you
so
glum
you
were
cheerful
enough
when
you
met
me
and
when
we
began
then
you
got
silent
what
the
matter
nothing
he
said
she
slipped
her
hand
in
his
arm
there
is
something
she
said
do
tell
me
do
you
like
langton
he
asked
oh
immensely
why
oh
lord
solomon
what
do
you
mean
you
were
different
in
his
presence
julie
from
anything
you
been
before
they
took
a
few
paces
in
silence
then
peter
had
an
idea
and
glanced
at
her
she
was
laughing
silently
to
herself
he
let
her
hand
fall
from
his
arm
and
looked
away
he
knew
he
was
behaving
like
an
ass
but
he
could
not
help
it
she
stopped
suddenly
peter
she
said
i
want
to
talk
to
you
take
me
somewhere
where
it
possible
at
this
hour
of
the
evening
what
about
being
late
she
gave
a
little
stamp
with
her
foot
then
laughed
again
what
a
boy
it
is
she
said
do
you
know
anywhere
to
go
peter
hesitated
then
he
made
up
his
mind
there
was
an
hotel
he
knew
of
out
of
the
main
street
of
none
too
good
a
reputation
some
men
had
taken
langton
and
him
there
once
in
the
afternoon
between
the
hours
in
which
drinks
were
legally
sold
and
they
had
gone
through
the
hall
into
a
little
that
was
apparently
partly
a
partly
part
of
the
private
rooms
of
the
landlord
and
had
been
served
there
he
recalled
the
description
of
one
of
the
men
it
a
place
to
know
you
can
always
get
a
drink
and
take
in
anyone
you
please
come
on
then
he
said
and
turned
down
a
where
in
the
world
are
you
taking
me
demanded
julie
i
shall
have
no
reputation
left
if
this
gets
out
nor
shall
i
said
peter
nor
you
will
what
a
spree
do
you
think
it
worth
it
peter
under
a
shaded
lamp
they
were
passing
at
the
moment
he
glanced
at
her
and
his
pulses
raced
good
god
julie
he
said
you
could
do
anything
with
me
she
chuckled
with
laughter
her
brown
eyes
dancing
maybe
she
said
but
i
out
to
talk
to
you
for
your
good
now
they
turned
another
corner
into
an
old
street
and
under
an
arch
peter
walked
forward
to
the
hotel
entrance
and
entered
there
was
a
woman
in
the
office
who
glanced
up
and
looked
first
at
peter
then
at
julie
on
seeing
her
behind
him
she
came
forward
what
can
i
do
for
monsieur
she
asked
madame
said
peter
i
was
here
the
other
day
give
us
a
bottle
of
wine
in
that
little
room
at
the
back
will
you
why
certainly
monsieur
said
she
will
madame
follow
me
it
is
this
way
she
opened
the
door
and
switched
on
the
light
shall
i
light
the
fire
madame
she
demanded
julie
beamed
on
her
ah
yes
that
would
be
jolly
she
said
and
the
wine
madame
beaune
the
woman
smiled
and
bowed
let
madame
but
seat
herself
and
it
shall
come
she
said
and
went
out
julie
took
off
her
hat
and
walked
to
the
glass
patting
her
hair
give
me
a
cigarette
my
dear
she
said
it
was
jolly
hard
only
to
smoke
one
peter
opened
and
handed
her
his
case
in
silence
then
pulled
up
a
big
chair
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
girl
came
in
with
the
wine
and
glasses
which
she
set
on
the
table
and
then
knelt
down
to
light
the
fire
she
withdrew
and
shut
the
door
they
were
alone
peter
was
still
standing
julie
glanced
at
him
and
pointed
to
a
chair
opposite
give
me
a
drink
and
then
go
and
sit
there
she
said
he
obeyed
she
pulled
her
skirts
up
high
to
the
blaze
and
pushed
one
foot
out
to
the
logs
and
sat
there
provocative
sipping
her
wine
and
puffing
little
puffs
of
smoke
from
her
cigarette
now
then
she
said
what
did
i
do
wrong
peter
was
horribly
uncomfortable
he
felt
how
little
he
knew
this
girl
and
he
felt
also
how
much
he
loved
her
nothing
dear
he
said
i
was
a
beast
well
she
said
if
you
wo
tell
me
i
tell
you
i
was
quite
proper
immensely
and
intensely
proper
and
you
did
like
it
you
had
never
seen
me
so
you
thought
too
that
i
was
making
up
to
your
friend
is
that
so
peter
nodded
he
marvelled
that
she
should
know
so
well
and
he
wondered
what
was
coming
i
wonder
what
you
really
think
of
me
peter
she
went
on
i
suppose
you
think
i
never
can
be
serious
no
i
wo
say
serious
conventional
but
you
very
stupid
we
all
of
us
can
be
and
must
be
sometimes
you
asked
me
just
now
what
i
thought
of
your
friend
well
i
tell
you
he
is
as
different
from
you
as
possible
he
has
his
thoughts
no
doubt
but
he
prefers
to
be
very
tidy
he
takes
refuge
in
the
things
you
throw
overboard
he
not
at
all
my
sort
and
he
not
yours
either
in
a
way
goodness
knows
what
will
happen
to
either
of
us
but
he
be
captain
langton
to
the
end
of
his
days
i
envy
that
sort
of
person
intensely
and
when
i
meet
him
i
put
on
armour
see
peter
stared
at
her
how
is
he
different
from
donovan
he
asked
donovan
oh
lord
peter
how
dull
you
are
donovan
has
hardly
a
thought
in
his
head
about
anything
except
donovan
he
was
born
a
jolly
good
sort
and
he
sampled
pretty
well
everything
he
cool
as
a
cucumber
though
he
has
his
passions
like
everyone
else
if
you
keep
your
head
you
can
say
or
do
anything
with
donovan
but
langton
is
deliberate
he
knows
about
things
and
he
refuses
and
chooses
i
did
want
she
broke
off
peter
she
said
savagely
in
two
minutes
that
man
would
know
more
about
me
than
you
do
if
i
let
him
he
had
never
seen
her
so
the
childish
brown
eyes
had
a
look
in
them
that
reminded
him
of
an
animal
caught
in
a
trap
he
sprang
up
and
dropped
on
his
knees
by
her
side
catching
her
hand
oh
julie
do
he
said
what
do
you
mean
what
is
there
about
you
that
i
do
know
how
are
you
different
from
either
of
them
she
threw
her
cigarette
away
and
ran
her
fingers
through
his
hair
then
made
a
gesture
almost
as
if
pushing
something
away
peter
thought
and
laughed
her
old
ringing
trill
of
laughter
lor
peter
was
i
tragic
i
did
mean
to
be
my
dear
there
a
lot
about
me
that
you
do
know
but
something
that
you
guessed
i
abide
shams
and
conventions
really
let
have
life
i
say
whatever
it
is
heavens
i
seen
street
girls
with
more
in
them
than
i
pretended
to
your
friend
to
have
in
me
they
at
least
deal
with
human
nature
in
the
raw
but
that
why
i
love
you
there
no
need
to
pretend
to
you
partly
because
at
bottom
you
like
real
things
as
much
as
i
and
partly
because
oh
never
mind
julie
i
do
mind
tell
me
he
insisted
her
face
changed
again
not
now
peter
she
said
perhaps
one
day
who
can
say
meantime
go
on
liking
me
will
you
like
you
he
exclaimed
springing
up
why
i
adore
you
i
love
you
oh
julie
i
love
you
kiss
me
darling
now
quick
she
pushed
him
off
not
now
she
cried
i
got
to
have
my
revenge
i
know
why
you
would
come
home
in
the
cab
come
we
clink
glasses
but
that
all
there
is
to
be
done
she
sprang
up
flushed
and
glowing
and
held
out
an
empty
glass
peter
filled
hers
and
his
and
they
stood
opposite
to
each
other
she
looked
across
the
wine
at
him
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
read
a
longing
and
a
passion
in
her
eyes
deep
down
below
the
merriness
that
was
there
now
cheerio
old
boy
she
said
raising
hers
and
to
the
day
when
your
big
boots
and
my
little
shoes
lie
outside
the
same
closed
door
julie
he
said
you
do
mean
it
do
i
how
do
you
know
old
come
buck
up
solomon
been
sentimental
long
enough
i
like
to
go
to
a
now
or
do
a
but
neither
really
possible
certainly
not
the
first
and
you
be
shocked
at
the
second
i
half
a
mind
to
shock
you
though
only
my
skirt
not
long
and
wide
enough
and
i
not
enough
lace
underneath
i
spare
you
come
on
she
seized
her
hat
and
put
it
on
they
went
out
into
the
hall
there
was
a
man
in
uniform
there
at
the
office
and
a
girl
french
and
unmistakable
who
glanced
at
julie
and
then
turned
away
julie
nodded
to
madame
and
did
not
glance
at
the
man
but
as
she
passed
the
girl
she
said
distinctly
bon
soir
mademoiselle
the
girl
started
and
turned
towards
her
julie
smiled
sweetly
and
passed
on
peter
took
her
arm
in
the
street
for
it
was
quite
dark
and
deserted
why
did
you
do
that
he
said
what
she
demanded
speak
to
that
girl
you
know
what
she
is
i
do
a
poor
devil
that
playing
with
fate
for
the
sake
of
a
laugh
and
a
bit
of
ribbon
i
jolly
sorry
for
her
for
they
are
both
worth
a
great
deal
and
it
hard
to
be
cheated
into
thinking
you
got
them
when
fate
is
really
winning
the
deal
and
i
saw
her
face
before
she
turned
away
why
do
you
think
she
turned
away
peter
not
because
she
was
ashamed
but
because
she
is
beginning
to
know
that
fate
wins
oh
la
la
what
a
world
let
be
more
cheerful
a
long
long
trail
she
hummed
peter
laughed
oh
my
dear
he
said
was
there
ever
anyone
like
you
langton
was
reading
in
his
room
when
peter
looked
in
to
say
hullo
he
said
see
her
home
yes
said
peter
what
did
you
think
of
her
she
fathoms
deep
i
should
say
but
i
should
take
care
if
i
were
you
my
boy
it
all
very
well
to
eat
and
drink
with
publicans
and
sinners
though
as
i
told
you
it
better
no
one
should
know
but
they
are
dangerous
company
why
especially
demanded
peter
langton
stretched
himself
oh
i
do
know
he
said
perhaps
because
society
agin
look
here
langton
said
peter
do
you
hear
what
i
say
society
besides
do
you
think
your
description
applies
to
that
girl
langton
smiled
no
he
said
i
should
think
so
but
she
not
your
sort
peter
when
you
take
that
tunic
off
you
got
to
put
on
a
black
coat
whatever
conclusions
you
come
to
do
forget
that
have
i
said
peter
i
wonder
langton
got
up
of
course
you
have
he
said
life
a
bit
of
a
farce
but
one
got
to
play
it
see
here
i
believe
in
facing
facts
and
getting
one
eyes
open
but
not
in
making
oneself
a
fool
nothing
worth
that
is
it
said
peter
and
again
i
wonder
well
i
do
and
at
any
rate
i
for
bed
said
peter
i
off
too
but
i
do
agree
with
you
inclined
to
think
exactly
the
opposite
that
anything
worth
having
is
worth
making
oneself
a
fool
over
what
is
a
fool
anyway
he
closed
the
door
and
langton
walked
over
to
the
window
to
open
it
he
stood
there
a
few
minutes
listening
to
the
silence
then
a
cock
crew
somewhere
and
was
answered
far
away
by
another
yes
said
langton
to
himself
what
is
a
fool
anyway
chapter
ii
the
lessing
family
sat
at
dinner
and
it
was
to
be
observed
that
some
of
those
incredible
wonders
at
which
peter
graham
had
once
hinted
to
hilda
had
come
about
there
were
only
three
courses
and
lessing
had
but
one
glass
of
wine
for
one
thing
for
another
he
was
actually
in
uniform
and
was
far
more
proud
of
his
corporal
stripes
than
he
had
previously
been
of
his
churchwarden
staff
of
office
nor
was
he
only
in
the
volunteers
he
was
actually
in
training
to
some
extent
and
the
war
had
at
any
rate
done
him
good
his
wife
was
not
dressed
for
dinner
either
she
had
just
come
in
from
a
war
committee
of
some
sort
a
solitary
maid
waited
on
them
and
they
had
already
given
up
fires
in
the
not
that
lessing
income
had
appreciably
diminished
but
quite
honestly
he
and
his
were
out
to
win
the
war
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
at
last
that
business
could
not
go
on
as
usual
but
routed
out
of
that
stronghold
he
had
made
for
himself
another
the
war
was
now
to
him
a
business
he
viewed
it
in
that
light
we
must
stop
them
he
was
saying
mark
my
words
they
never
get
to
amiens
did
you
see
haig
last
order
to
the
troops
not
another
inch
was
to
be
given
at
any
cost
we
sha
give
either
we
to
win
this
war
there
too
much
at
stake
for
us
to
lose
whoever
has
to
foot
the
bill
for
this
business
is
ruined
and
it
not
going
to
be
great
britain
they
were
saying
in
the
hall
that
the
army
is
as
cheerful
as
possible
that
the
best
sign
i
doubt
the
german
army
is
graham
say
anything
about
it
hilda
no
father
said
hilda
shortly
and
bent
over
her
plate
thing
he
a
smart
chap
and
i
should
have
thought
have
been
full
of
it
perhaps
he
too
far
back
he
was
in
a
big
town
he
does
name
the
other
day
in
an
and
a
man
was
killed
in
his
carriage
good
lord
you
do
say
so
when
did
you
hear
that
i
thought
we
had
command
of
the
air
i
got
a
letter
father
he
just
mentioned
that
but
he
say
much
else
about
it
he
at
abbeville
now
on
the
somme
and
he
says
the
germans
come
over
fairly
often
by
night
impossible
snorted
the
old
man
i
have
it
on
the
best
possible
authority
that
our
air
service
is
completely
up
to
date
now
and
far
better
than
the
german
he
must
be
exaggerating
they
would
never
allow
the
enemy
to
us
in
so
important
a
department
what
else
does
he
say
oh
nothing
said
hilda
or
at
least
nothing
about
the
war
in
a
way
it
full
of
of
his
work
she
stopped
abruptly
well
well
said
lessing
i
was
against
his
going
at
first
but
it
all
shoulders
to
the
wheel
now
and
it
was
plain
he
ought
to
see
a
little
life
out
there
a
young
man
who
does
wo
have
much
of
a
look
in
afterwards
that
how
reasoned
it
and
he
works
hard
does
graham
i
always
said
that
for
him
i
expect
he
of
great
service
to
them
eh
hilda
i
do
know
said
the
girl
he
does
say
but
he
been
chosen
for
some
special
work
lecturing
or
something
and
that
why
he
at
abbeville
ah
good
special
work
eh
he
go
far
yet
that
fellow
i
do
know
that
i
have
chosen
him
for
you
hilda
at
first
but
this
business
has
shaken
us
all
up
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
graham
comes
to
the
front
over
it
he
stopped
as
the
maid
came
in
i
think
i
have
my
coffee
in
the
study
my
dear
he
said
to
lessing
i
have
some
reading
to
do
when
the
two
women
were
once
more
alone
lessing
put
her
cup
down
and
spoke
what
is
it
dear
she
questioned
hilda
did
not
look
at
her
the
two
indeed
understood
each
other
very
well
i
ca
tell
you
here
mother
she
said
come
then
dear
said
lessing
rising
let
go
to
my
room
your
father
will
be
busy
for
some
time
and
we
shall
not
be
disturbed
there
she
led
the
way
and
lit
a
small
gas
fire
i
ca
be
cold
in
my
bedroom
she
said
and
though
i
hate
these
things
they
are
better
than
nothing
now
dear
what
is
it
hilda
seated
herself
on
a
footstool
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
and
stared
into
it
the
light
shone
on
her
fair
skin
and
hair
and
lessing
contemplated
her
with
satisfaction
from
several
points
of
view
for
one
thing
hilda
was
so
sensible
what
is
it
she
asked
again
your
father
saw
nothing
men
do
but
you
ca
hide
from
me
dear
that
your
letter
has
troubled
you
is
peter
in
trouble
hilda
shook
her
head
then
she
said
well
at
least
mother
not
that
sort
of
trouble
i
told
father
truly
he
been
picked
for
special
service
well
then
what
is
it
lessing
was
a
trifle
impatient
mother
said
hilda
i
known
that
he
has
not
been
happy
ever
since
his
arrival
in
france
but
i
never
properly
understood
why
peter
is
queer
in
some
ways
you
know
you
remember
that
sermon
of
his
he
be
content
with
things
he
always
worrying
and
now
he
writes
dreadfully
he
says
she
hesitated
then
suddenly
she
pulled
out
the
letter
listen
mother
she
said
and
read
what
peter
had
written
in
the
club
until
the
end
am
going
to
eat
and
drink
with
publicans
and
sinners
maybe
i
shall
find
my
master
still
there
if
langton
could
have
seen
lessing
he
would
have
smiled
that
cynical
smile
of
his
with
much
satisfaction
she
was
frankly
horrified
rendered
in
fact
almost
speechless
hilda
she
exclaimed
what
a
thing
to
write
to
you
but
what
does
he
mean
has
he
forgotten
that
he
is
a
clergyman
why
it
positively
blasphemous
he
is
speaking
of
christ
i
suppose
my
poor
girl
he
must
be
mad
surely
you
see
that
dear
hilda
stared
on
into
the
fire
and
made
no
reply
her
mother
hardly
needed
one
has
he
met
another
woman
hilda
she
demanded
i
do
know
he
does
say
so
said
hilda
miserably
but
anyhow
i
do
see
that
that
matters
not
matter
girl
are
you
mad
too
he
is
your
fiancé
is
he
really
i
think
i
must
speak
to
your
father
hilda
turned
her
head
slowly
and
mother
and
daughter
looked
at
each
other
lessing
was
a
woman
of
the
world
but
she
was
a
good
mother
and
she
read
in
her
daughter
eyes
what
every
mother
has
to
read
sooner
or
later
it
was
as
one
woman
to
another
and
not
as
mother
to
daughter
that
she
continued
lamely
well
hilda
what
do
you
make
of
it
all
what
are
you
going
to
do
the
girl
looked
away
again
and
a
silence
fell
between
them
then
she
said
speaking
in
short
slow
sentences
i
will
tell
you
what
i
make
of
it
mother
peter
gone
beyond
me
i
think
now
that
i
have
always
feared
a
little
that
he
might
of
course
he
impetuous
and
headstrong
but
it
is
more
than
that
he
feels
differently
from
me
from
all
of
us
i
can
see
that
though
i
understand
him
a
bit
i
thought
her
voice
faltered
he
loved
me
more
he
knows
how
i
wanted
him
to
get
on
in
the
church
and
how
i
would
have
helped
him
but
that
nothing
to
him
or
next
to
nothing
i
think
he
does
love
me
at
all
mother
and
never
really
did
lessing
threw
her
head
back
then
he
a
fool
my
dear
she
said
emphatically
you
worth
loving
you
know
it
i
should
think
no
more
about
him
hilda
hilda
hands
tightened
round
her
knees
i
ca
do
that
she
said
lessing
was
impatient
again
do
you
mean
hilda
that
if
he
persists
in
this
this
madness
if
he
gives
up
the
church
for
example
you
will
not
break
off
the
engagement
mind
you
that
is
the
point
every
young
man
must
have
a
bit
of
a
fling
possibly
even
clergymen
i
suppose
and
they
get
over
it
a
sensible
girl
knows
that
but
if
he
ruins
his
prospects
surely
hilda
you
are
not
going
to
be
a
fool
the
word
had
been
spoken
again
peter
had
had
something
to
say
on
it
and
now
the
gods
gave
hilda
her
chance
she
stretched
her
fine
hands
out
to
the
fire
and
a
new
note
came
into
her
voice
a
fool
mother
oh
no
i
sha
be
a
fool
a
fool
would
follow
him
to
the
end
of
the
world
a
fool
of
a
woman
would
give
him
all
he
wants
for
the
sake
of
giving
and
be
content
with
nothing
in
return
i
see
that
but
i
not
made
for
that
sort
of
foolery
no
i
sha
be
a
fool
lessing
could
not
conceal
her
satisfaction
well
i
am
sure
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
it
and
so
would
your
father
be
we
have
not
brought
you
up
carefully
for
nothing
hilda
you
are
a
woman
now
and
i
do
believe
in
trying
to
force
a
woman
against
her
will
but
i
am
heartily
glad
my
dear
that
you
are
so
sensible
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
and
have
a
daughter
of
your
own
you
will
be
glad
that
you
have
behaved
so
hilda
got
up
and
put
her
hands
behind
her
head
which
was
a
favourite
posture
of
hers
she
stood
looking
down
at
her
mother
with
a
curious
expression
on
her
face
lessing
could
make
nothing
of
it
she
merely
thought
hilda
queer
she
had
travelled
farther
than
she
knew
from
youth
shall
i
mother
said
hilda
yes
i
expect
i
shall
i
have
been
carefully
brought
up
as
you
say
so
carefully
that
even
now
i
can
only
just
see
what
a
fool
might
do
and
i
know
quite
well
that
i
ca
do
it
after
a
while
i
shall
no
more
see
it
than
you
do
i
shall
even
probably
forget
that
i
ever
did
so
that
is
all
and
because
i
love
him
really
i
do
think
i
can
even
say
peter
that
curious
is
it
mother
well
i
think
i
go
to
my
room
for
a
little
i
wo
come
in
again
she
bent
and
kissed
lessing
her
mother
held
her
arms
a
moment
more
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
demanded
hilda
freed
herself
write
and
try
to
persuade
him
not
to
be
a
fool
either
i
think
not
that
it
any
good
and
then
wait
and
see
she
walked
to
the
floor
of
course
this
is
just
between
us
two
is
it
dear
she
said
playing
with
the
handle
of
course
said
her
mother
but
do
be
sensible
dear
and
do
wait
too
long
it
is
much
better
not
to
play
with
these
things
much
better
and
do
tell
me
how
things
go
darling
wo
you
oh
yes
said
hilda
slowly
oh
yes
i
tell
you
she
passed
out
and
closed
the
door
gently
i
wonder
why
i
ca
cry
she
asked
herself
as
she
went
to
her
room
and
quite
honestly
she
did
not
know
across
the
water
peter
affairs
were
speeding
up
if
hilda
could
have
seen
him
that
night
she
would
probably
have
wept
without
difficulty
but
for
a
much
more
superficial
reason
than
the
reason
why
she
could
not
weep
in
london
and
it
came
about
in
this
way
on
the
morning
after
the
dinner
peter
was
moody
and
declared
he
would
not
go
down
to
the
office
but
would
take
a
novel
out
to
the
canal
he
was
in
half
a
mind
to
go
up
and
call
at
the
hospital
but
something
held
him
back
reflection
showed
him
how
near
he
had
been
to
the
fatal
kiss
the
night
before
and
he
did
not
wish
or
with
the
morning
he
thought
he
did
not
wish
to
see
julie
so
soon
again
so
he
got
his
novel
and
went
out
to
the
canal
finding
a
place
where
last
year
leaves
still
lay
thick
and
one
could
lie
at
ease
and
read
we
do
these
things
all
our
days
and
never
learn
the
lesson
through
the
morning
he
looked
up
to
see
langton
striding
along
towards
him
he
was
walking
quickly
with
the
air
of
one
who
brings
news
and
he
delivered
his
message
as
soon
as
they
were
within
earshot
of
each
other
good
news
graham
he
called
out
this
tomfoolery
is
over
they
heard
from
that
the
whole
stunt
is
postponed
and
we
all
to
go
back
to
our
bases
is
it
like
he
demanded
as
he
came
up
old
jackson
in
the
office
is
swearing
like
blazes
he
had
all
his
maps
made
and
plans
drawn
up
etcetera
and
etcetera
and
now
they
so
much
jolly
fortunate
any
road
he
sat
down
and
got
out
a
pipe
peter
shut
his
book
i
glad
he
said
i
sick
of
foolin
round
here
not
but
what
it
is
a
decent
enough
place
but
i
prefer
the
other
there
more
doing
when
do
we
go
they
getting
our
movement
orders
yours
to
havre
mine
to
rouen
i
put
in
a
spoke
for
you
to
get
one
via
rouen
but
i
do
know
if
you
will
it
a
vile
journey
otherwise
by
jove
cried
peter
i
an
idea
miss
gamelyn
troop
of
goes
back
to
havre
empty
why
should
i
travel
on
them
think
i
could
work
it
langton
puffed
solemnly
sure
i
should
think
he
said
being
a
padre
anyway
what
had
i
best
do
oh
i
should
go
and
see
jackson
and
get
him
to
the
hospital
for
you
that
is
if
you
really
want
to
go
that
way
it
far
better
than
that
vile
train
said
peter
besides
one
can
see
the
country
which
i
love
and
i
never
been
in
dieppe
and
they
to
go
through
there
and
pick
up
some
casualties
just
so
said
langton
still
smoking
well
said
peter
reckon
i
go
and
see
about
it
jackson
a
decent
old
stick
but
i
best
do
it
before
he
tackles
the
coming
no
said
langton
leave
that
novel
and
come
back
for
me
you
wo
be
long
said
peter
and
set
off
it
was
easily
done
jackson
had
no
objections
and
rang
up
the
hospital
while
peter
waited
oh
yes
certainly
they
could
do
it
what
was
the
name
captain
graham
certainly
he
must
be
at
the
hospital
early
the
next
morning
that
all
right
thank
you
thank
you
said
peter
motoring
a
long
sight
better
than
the
train
these
days
and
i
get
in
quicker
too
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
at
any
rate
just
as
quickly
he
turned
to
go
but
a
thought
struck
him
have
you
an
orderly
to
spare
he
asked
any
quantity
said
the
other
bitterly
they
been
detailed
for
weeks
and
done
nothing
you
can
have
one
with
pleasure
it
give
the
perisher
something
to
do
thanks
said
peter
i
want
to
send
a
note
that
all
may
i
write
it
here
he
was
given
pen
and
paper
and
scribbled
a
little
note
to
julie
he
did
not
know
who
else
might
be
on
the
lorry
or
if
she
would
want
to
appear
to
know
him
the
orderly
was
called
and
despatched
and
he
left
the
place
for
the
last
time
langton
and
he
walked
out
to
riquier
in
the
afternoon
had
tea
there
and
got
back
to
dinner
a
note
was
waiting
for
peter
a
characteristic
one
dearest
solomon
it
ran
you
are
really
waking
up
there
will
be
three
of
us
nurses
in
one
lorry
and
they
sure
to
start
you
off
in
another
we
lunch
at
eu
and
i
be
delighted
to
see
you
then
you
can
go
on
in
our
car
dieppe
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
as
you
say
but
probably
we
can
pull
off
something
julie
he
smiled
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
langton
said
nothing
till
the
coffee
and
liqueurs
came
in
then
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
held
the
match
out
to
peter
wonder
if
we
shall
meet
again
he
said
oh
i
expect
so
said
peter
write
anyway
wo
you
i
likely
get
a
chance
to
come
to
rouen
and
i
likely
wo
be
there
i
putting
in
again
for
another
job
they
short
of
men
now
and
want
equipment
officers
for
the
a
stunt
for
which
engineering
useful
and
i
may
get
in
i
do
suppose
i
see
much
of
the
fun
but
it
better
than
bossing
up
a
labour
company
any
road
sportsman
said
peter
i
envy
you
why
did
you
tell
me
i
half
a
mind
to
put
in
too
do
you
think
i
have
a
chance
no
said
langton
brutally
besides
it
not
your
line
you
know
what
yours
is
stick
to
it
and
you
know
that
i
not
so
sure
that
i
can
said
peter
rot
said
the
other
you
can
if
you
like
you
wo
gain
by
running
away
only
i
give
you
this
bit
of
advice
old
son
go
slow
you
so
damned
you
ca
remake
the
world
to
order
in
five
minutes
and
if
you
could
i
bet
it
would
be
a
much
better
old
world
worried
along
for
some
time
moderately
well
do
be
too
ready
to
turn
down
the
things
that
have
worked
with
some
success
at
any
rate
for
the
things
that
have
never
been
tried
peter
smoked
in
silence
then
he
said
langton
you
a
bit
different
from
what
you
were
in
a
way
it
you
who
have
set
me
out
on
this
racket
and
it
you
who
encouraged
me
to
try
and
get
down
to
you
always
been
a
cautious
old
rotter
but
you
more
than
cautious
now
why
langton
leaned
over
and
touched
the
other
tunic
pocket
in
which
lay
julie
note
then
he
leaned
back
and
went
on
with
his
cigarette
peter
flushed
it
too
late
he
said
judicially
flicking
off
his
ash
so
well
i
sorry
frankly
sorry
for
her
and
sorry
for
you
but
if
it
is
i
remember
my
own
wisdom
it
no
use
meddling
with
such
things
for
all
that
you
a
fool
peter
as
i
told
you
last
night
just
so
and
i
asked
what
was
a
fool
and
i
did
answer
i
reckon
fools
can
be
of
many
sorts
your
sort
of
fool
chucks
the
world
over
for
the
quest
of
an
ideal
thank
you
said
peter
quietly
you
need
that
fool
is
a
real
fool
and
bigger
than
most
ideals
are
ideals
and
one
ca
realise
them
it
waste
of
time
to
try
is
it
said
peter
well
at
any
rate
i
do
know
that
i
out
after
them
much
i
do
see
any
all
i
know
is
that
i
looked
in
the
likely
places
and
now
i
look
in
the
unlikely
langton
ground
his
in
his
you
will
he
said
whatever
i
say
have
another
drink
after
all
there
no
need
to
down
the
empty
glass
yet
they
did
not
see
each
other
in
the
morning
and
peter
made
his
way
early
to
the
hospital
as
arranged
the
met
him
and
he
was
put
in
nominal
charge
of
the
three
while
he
was
talking
to
the
doctor
the
three
nurses
came
out
and
got
in
julie
not
looking
in
his
direction
then
he
climbed
up
next
the
driver
of
the
first
car
cheerio
said
the
and
they
were
off
it
was
a
dull
day
and
mists
hung
over
the
by
the
somme
for
all
that
peter
enjoyed
himself
immensely
they
ran
swiftly
through
the
little
villages
under
the
sweeping
trees
all
into
green
and
soon
had
vistas
of
the
distant
sea
the
driver
of
peter
car
was
an
observant
fellow
and
he
knew
something
of
gardening
it
was
he
who
pointed
out
that
the
had
been
indifferently
pruned
or
not
pruned
at
all
and
that
there
were
fields
no
longer
under
the
plough
that
had
been
plainly
so
not
long
before
in
a
word
the
country
bore
its
war
scars
although
it
needed
a
clever
eye
to
see
them
but
peter
had
little
thought
for
this
now
and
again
at
a
corner
he
would
glance
back
his
mind
on
julie
in
the
following
car
while
every
church
tower
gave
him
pause
for
thought
he
tried
to
draw
the
man
beside
him
on
religion
but
without
any
success
though
he
talked
freely
enough
of
other
things
he
was
for
the
colonies
after
the
war
he
said
knocked
about
a
good
deal
in
france
and
the
taste
for
travel
had
come
to
him
canada
appeared
a
land
of
promise
one
could
get
a
farm
easily
and
his
motor
knowledge
would
be
useful
on
a
farm
these
days
yes
he
had
a
pal
out
there
a
canadian
who
had
done
his
bit
and
been
invalided
out
of
it
they
corresponded
and
he
expected
to
get
in
with
him
the
local
knowledge
eking
out
the
other
technical
no
he
was
for
marrying
yet
awhile
he
wait
till
he
got
a
place
for
the
wife
and
kiddies
then
he
would
the
thought
made
him
expand
a
bit
and
peter
smiled
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
his
conversation
with
langton
over
the
family
group
it
struck
him
to
test
the
man
and
as
they
passed
a
wayside
calvary
rudely
painted
he
drew
his
attention
to
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
asked
the
man
glanced
at
it
and
then
away
it
all
right
for
them
as
like
it
he
said
religion
best
in
a
church
it
seems
to
me
i
seen
chaps
mock
at
them
crucifixes
sir
same
as
they
would
if
they
only
been
in
church
yes
said
peter
but
i
suppose
some
men
have
been
helped
by
them
who
never
would
have
been
if
they
had
only
been
in
church
but
do
you
think
they
rather
gaudy
gaudy
sir
meanin
painted
no
not
as
i
knows
on
they
more
like
what
happened
i
reckon
than
them
brass
crosses
we
have
in
our
churches
they
ran
into
eu
for
lunch
and
drew
up
in
the
peter
went
round
to
the
girls
car
greeted
julie
and
was
introduced
he
led
them
to
an
old
inn
in
the
square
and
they
sat
down
to
luncheon
in
very
good
humour
the
other
girls
were
ordinary
enough
and
julie
rather
subdued
for
her
afterwards
they
spent
an
hour
in
the
church
and
a
shop
and
it
was
there
that
julie
whispered
go
on
in
your
own
car
at
dieppe
go
to
the
hôtel
trois
poissons
and
wait
for
me
i
found
out
yesterday
that
a
woman
i
know
is
a
doctor
in
dieppe
and
she
lives
there
i
get
leave
easily
to
call
then
i
can
see
you
if
we
travel
together
these
girls
talk
they
just
the
sort
peter
nodded
understanding
and
they
drifted
apart
he
went
out
to
see
if
the
cars
were
ready
and
returned
to
call
the
nurses
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
off
again
the
road
now
ran
through
forests
nearly
all
the
way
except
where
villages
had
cleared
a
space
around
them
as
was
plain
to
see
they
crossed
little
streams
and
finally
came
downhill
through
the
forest
into
the
river
valley
that
leads
to
dieppe
it
was
still
early
and
peter
stopped
the
cars
to
suggest
that
they
might
have
a
look
at
the
castle
of
the
grand
old
pile
kept
them
nearly
an
hour
and
they
wandered
about
the
ruins
to
their
hearts
content
julie
would
climb
a
buttress
of
the
ancient
keep
when
their
guide
had
gone
on
with
the
others
and
peter
went
up
after
her
she
was
as
lissom
as
a
boy
and
seemingly
as
strong
swinging
up
by
roots
of
ivy
and
the
branches
of
a
near
tree
in
no
wise
impeded
by
her
short
skirts
from
the
top
one
had
indeed
a
glorious
view
the
weather
had
cleared
somewhat
and
one
could
see
every
bit
of
the
old
castle
below
the
village
at
its
feet
and
the
forest
across
the
little
stream
out
of
which
the
duke
of
infantry
had
debouched
that
day
of
battle
from
which
the
village
took
its
name
they
had
some
of
the
first
guns
in
the
castle
which
was
held
for
henry
of
navarre
explained
peter
and
they
did
great
execution
i
suppose
they
fired
one
stone
shot
in
about
every
five
minutes
and
killed
a
man
about
every
the
enemy
were
more
frightened
than
hurt
i
should
think
anyway
henry
won
was
he
the
king
who
thought
paris
worth
more
than
a
mass
she
demanded
yes
said
peter
watching
her
brown
eyes
as
she
stared
out
over
the
plain
i
wonder
what
he
thinks
now
she
said
he
laughed
you
likely
to
wonder
he
said
funny
old
days
said
julie
i
suppose
there
were
girls
in
this
castle
watching
the
fight
i
expect
they
cared
more
for
the
one
man
each
the
cannon
hit
than
for
either
paris
or
the
mass
that
the
way
of
women
peter
and
a
damned
silly
way
it
is
come
on
let
go
i
get
down
first
if
you
please
on
the
short
road
remaining
peter
asked
his
chauffeur
if
he
knew
the
trois
poissons
and
finding
that
he
did
had
the
direction
pointed
out
they
ran
through
the
town
to
the
hospital
and
peter
handed
his
cars
over
i
sleep
in
town
he
said
what
time
ought
we
to
start
in
the
morning
he
was
told
and
walked
away
julie
had
disappeared
he
found
the
trois
poissons
without
difficulty
and
made
his
way
to
the
a
queer
room
opening
from
the
pavement
direct
on
the
one
side
and
from
the
hall
of
the
hotel
on
the
other
it
had
a
table
down
the
middle
a
weird
selection
of
chairs
and
a
piano
a
small
woman
was
sitting
in
a
chair
reading
the
and
smoking
an
empty
glass
stood
beside
her
she
looked
up
as
he
came
in
and
he
noticed
badges
he
said
cheerily
padre
she
replied
plainly
willing
to
talk
where
have
you
sprung
from
abbeville
via
eu
in
a
convoy
of
red
cross
cars
he
said
and
i
feel
like
a
wo
you
have
another
with
me
sure
thing
she
said
and
he
ordered
a
couple
from
the
french
maid
who
came
in
answer
to
his
ring
do
you
live
here
he
asked
for
my
sins
i
do
she
said
i
doctor
waac
and
i
do
think
much
of
it
a
finer
heartier
lot
of
women
i
never
saw
epsom
salts
is
all
they
want
a
child
could
do
it
peter
laughed
well
i
do
see
why
you
should
grumble
he
said
do
you
where
the
practice
this
business
out
here
is
the
best
chance
for
doctors
in
a
lifetime
and
i
have
to
strip
strapping
girls
hopelessly
and
endlessly
you
do
do
you
said
a
voice
in
the
doorway
and
there
stood
julie
well
at
any
rate
you
ought
to
talk
about
it
like
that
to
my
gentleman
friends
especially
padres
how
do
you
do
my
dear
julie
by
all
that
holy
where
have
you
sprung
from
she
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
from
abbeville
via
eu
in
a
convoy
of
red
cross
cars
i
dare
bet
she
said
julie
you
beyond
me
if
you
were
so
strong
i
smack
you
but
as
it
is
give
me
another
kiss
introduce
us
there
may
as
well
be
propriety
somewhere
they
sorted
themselves
out
and
sat
down
what
do
you
think
of
my
rig
demanded
melville
as
julie
had
introduced
her
toppin
said
julie
critically
but
what
in
the
world
is
it
chiefly
waac
with
three
pukka
stars
and
an
badge
teanie
how
dare
you
do
it
i
dare
do
all
that
doth
become
a
woman
she
answered
complacently
and
it
doth
doth
it
not
skirt
a
trifle
short
perhaps
she
added
sticking
out
a
leg
and
examining
the
effect
critically
but
eminently
satisfactory
julie
leaned
over
and
prodded
her
no
corsets
she
inquired
innocently
julie
you
positively
indecent
you
must
have
tamed
your
padre
completely
you
not
married
by
any
chance
she
added
suddenly
julie
screamed
with
laughter
oh
teanie
you
be
the
death
of
me
she
said
at
last
solomon
are
we
married
i
do
think
so
teanie
there
never
no
telling
these
days
but
i
ca
recollect
it
well
it
strikes
me
you
ought
to
be
if
you
jogging
round
the
country
together
said
the
other
her
eyes
twinkling
but
if
you
not
take
warning
padre
a
girl
that
talks
about
corsets
in
public
respectable
especially
as
she
does
wear
them
herself
except
in
the
evening
for
the
sake
of
other
things
or
she
used
not
to
but
perhaps
you
know
peter
tried
to
look
comfortable
but
he
was
completely
out
of
his
depth
he
finished
his
drink
with
a
happy
inspiration
and
ordered
another
that
down
he
began
to
feel
more
capable
of
entering
into
the
spirit
of
these
two
they
were
the
sort
he
wanted
to
know
both
of
them
women
about
as
different
from
those
he
had
met
as
they
could
possibly
be
another
man
dropped
in
after
a
while
so
the
talk
became
general
the
atmosphere
was
very
free
and
easy
bantering
careless
jolly
and
peter
expanded
in
it
julie
led
them
all
she
was
never
at
a
loss
and
apparently
had
no
care
in
the
world
the
two
girls
and
peter
went
together
to
dinner
and
sat
at
the
same
table
they
talked
a
good
deal
together
and
peter
gathered
they
had
come
to
know
each
other
at
a
hospital
in
england
they
were
full
of
reminiscences
do
you
remember
ducking
pockett
teanie
asked
julie
lor
i
should
think
i
do
tell
peter
he
wo
be
horrified
unless
you
go
into
details
if
i
cough
solomon
you
to
change
the
subject
carry
on
teanie
well
pockett
was
a
nurse
of
about
the
last
limit
she
was
fearfully
snobby
which
nobody
of
that
name
ought
to
be
and
she
ruled
her
pros
with
a
rod
of
iron
i
expect
that
was
good
for
them
and
i
say
nothing
as
to
that
but
she
was
a
beast
to
the
boys
we
had
some
poor
chaps
in
who
were
damnably
knocked
about
and
one
could
do
a
lot
for
them
in
roundabout
ways
regulations
are
made
to
be
broken
in
some
cases
i
think
but
she
was
a
holy
terror
sooner
than
call
her
the
boys
would
endure
anything
but
some
of
us
knew
and
once
she
caught
julie
here
it
was
it
was
you
teanie
oh
well
one
of
us
anyway
in
her
ward
when
she
was
on
night
duty
sitting
with
a
poor
chap
who
pegged
out
a
few
days
after
it
soothed
him
to
sit
and
hold
her
hand
well
anyway
she
was
furious
and
reported
it
there
was
a
bit
of
a
row
had
to
be
i
suppose
as
it
was
against
regulations
but
thank
god
the
knew
his
job
so
there
was
only
a
strafe
with
the
tongue
in
the
cheek
however
we
swore
revenge
and
we
had
it
eh
julie
we
did
go
on
it
was
you
who
thought
of
it
well
we
filled
a
bath
with
tepid
water
and
then
went
to
her
room
one
night
she
was
asleep
and
never
heard
us
we
had
a
towel
round
her
head
in
two
twinks
and
carried
her
by
the
legs
and
arms
to
the
bathroom
julie
had
her
legs
and
held
well
up
so
that
down
went
her
head
under
water
she
could
yell
then
when
we
let
her
up
i
douched
her
with
cold
water
and
then
we
bolted
we
saw
to
it
that
there
was
a
towel
in
the
bathroom
and
we
locked
her
bedroom
door
oh
lor
poor
soul
but
it
was
funny
she
met
an
orderly
in
the
corridor
and
he
nearly
had
a
fit
and
i
do
wonder
for
her
wet
nightie
clung
to
her
figure
like
a
skin
she
had
to
try
half
a
dozen
rooms
before
she
got
anyone
to
help
her
and
then
when
she
got
back
we
ragged
her
room
to
blazes
she
never
said
a
word
and
left
soon
after
ever
hear
of
her
again
julie
no
said
she
looking
more
innocent
than
ever
peter
thought
but
i
expect
she
made
good
somewhere
she
must
have
had
something
in
her
or
she
have
kicked
up
a
row
miss
melville
was
laughing
silently
you
innocent
babe
unborn
she
said
never
shall
i
forget
how
you
held
come
on
captain
graham
said
julie
getting
up
you
got
to
see
me
home
and
i
want
a
nice
walk
by
the
they
went
out
together
and
stood
at
the
hotel
door
in
the
little
street
there
was
a
bit
of
a
moon
with
clouds
scurrying
by
and
when
it
shone
the
road
was
damp
and
glistening
in
the
moonlight
what
a
heavenly
night
said
julie
come
on
with
us
along
the
teanie
do
miss
melville
smiled
up
at
them
i
reckon
you
prefer
to
be
alone
she
said
peter
glanced
at
julie
and
then
protested
no
he
said
do
come
on
and
julie
rewarded
him
with
a
smile
so
they
set
out
together
on
the
front
the
wind
was
higher
lashing
the
waves
and
the
moonlight
shone
fitfully
on
the
distant
cliffs
the
harbour
mouth
and
the
sea
the
two
girls
clung
together
and
as
peter
walked
by
julie
she
took
his
arm
conversation
was
difficult
as
they
battled
their
way
along
the
promenade
there
was
hardly
a
soul
about
and
peter
felt
the
night
to
fit
his
mood
they
went
up
once
and
down
again
and
at
the
casino
grounds
teanie
stopped
them
she
said
i
for
home
and
bed
you
two
dears
can
finish
up
without
me
oh
we
must
see
you
home
said
peter
the
doctor
laughed
think
i
shall
get
stolen
she
demanded
someone
would
have
to
get
up
pretty
early
for
that
no
padre
i
past
the
need
of
being
escorted
thanks
be
good
julie
we
meet
again
sometime
i
hope
if
not
keep
smiling
cheerio
she
waved
her
hand
and
was
gone
in
the
night
if
there
was
ever
a
plucky
unselfish
rattling
good
woman
there
she
goes
said
julie
i
known
her
sit
up
night
after
night
with
wounded
men
when
she
was
working
like
a
horse
all
day
i
known
her
to
help
a
drunken
tommy
into
a
cab
and
get
him
home
and
quiet
his
wife
into
the
bargain
i
saw
her
once
walk
off
out
of
the
monico
with
a
boy
of
a
subaltern
who
know
what
he
was
doing
and
take
him
to
her
own
flat
and
put
him
to
bed
and
get
him
on
to
the
in
time
in
the
morning
she
give
away
her
last
penny
and
you
would
know
she
done
it
and
yet
she
not
the
sort
of
woman
you
choose
to
run
a
mother
meeting
would
you
solomon
sure
thing
i
would
said
peter
not
in
my
old
parish
but
i
not
so
sure
i
would
in
my
new
one
what
your
new
one
asked
julie
curiously
oh
it
has
a
name
said
peter
but
it
pretty
big
something
after
the
style
of
john
wesley
parish
i
reckon
and
i
gradually
getting
it
sized
up
where
do
i
come
in
solomon
demanded
julie
they
were
passing
by
the
big
calvary
at
the
harbour
gates
and
there
was
a
light
there
he
stopped
and
turned
so
that
the
light
fell
on
her
she
looked
up
at
him
and
so
they
stood
a
minute
he
could
hear
the
lash
of
the
waves
and
the
wind
drumming
in
the
rigging
of
the
flagstaff
near
them
then
deliberately
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
i
do
know
julie
he
said
but
i
believe
you
have
the
biggest
part
somehow
chapter
iii
all
that
it
is
necessary
to
know
of
hilda
return
letter
to
peter
ran
as
follows
my
dear
boy
your
letter
from
abbeville
reached
me
the
day
before
yesterday
and
i
have
thought
about
nothing
else
since
it
is
plain
to
me
that
it
is
no
use
arguing
with
you
and
no
good
reproaching
you
for
once
you
get
an
idea
into
your
head
nothing
but
bitter
experience
will
drive
it
out
but
peter
you
must
see
that
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
are
asking
me
to
choose
between
you
and
your
strange
ideas
and
all
that
is
familiar
and
dear
in
my
life
you
ca
honestly
expect
me
to
believe
that
my
church
and
my
parents
and
my
teachers
are
all
wrong
and
that
to
put
it
mildly
the
very
strange
people
you
appear
to
be
meeting
in
france
are
all
right
my
dear
peter
do
try
and
look
at
it
sensibly
the
story
you
told
me
of
the
death
of
lieutenant
jenks
was
terrible
terrible
it
brings
the
war
home
in
all
its
ghastly
reality
but
really
you
know
it
was
his
fault
and
not
yours
and
still
less
the
fault
of
the
church
of
england
that
he
did
not
want
you
when
he
came
to
die
if
a
man
lives
without
god
he
can
hardly
expect
to
find
him
at
the
point
of
sudden
death
what
you
say
about
christ
too
utterly
bewilders
me
surely
our
church
teachings
in
the
catechism
and
the
is
christian
teaching
is
it
nothing
is
perfect
on
earth
and
the
church
is
human
but
our
church
is
certainly
the
best
i
know
of
it
is
liberal
active
moderate
and
i
do
like
the
word
but
after
all
it
is
a
good
one
respectable
i
know
much
about
these
things
but
surely
you
of
all
people
do
want
to
go
shouting
in
the
street
like
a
salvation
army
captain
i
ca
see
that
that
is
more
touch
with
reality
peter
what
do
you
mean
are
not
john
and
the
canon
and
my
people
and
myself
real
surely
peter
our
love
is
real
is
it
oh
how
can
you
doubt
that
darling
boy
do
you
think
you
are
and
you
are
in
a
strange
country
among
strange
people
at
a
very
peculiar
time
war
always
upsets
everything
and
makes
things
abnormal
london
even
is
normal
but
as
the
canon
said
the
other
day
a
great
many
of
the
things
people
do
just
now
are
due
to
reaction
against
strain
and
anxiety
ca
you
see
this
is
there
any
clergyman
you
can
go
and
talk
to
your
presbyterian
and
other
new
friends
and
your
visits
to
roman
catholic
churches
ca
be
any
real
help
peter
dear
for
my
sake
do
try
to
see
things
like
this
i
that
bit
in
your
letter
about
publicans
and
sinners
how
can
a
clergyman
expect
to
help
surely
you
ought
to
avoid
such
people
not
seek
their
company
it
is
so
like
you
to
get
hold
of
a
text
or
two
and
run
it
to
death
it
not
that
i
do
you
but
you
are
so
easily
influenced
and
you
may
equally
easily
go
and
do
something
that
will
separate
us
and
ruin
your
life
peter
i
hate
to
write
like
this
but
i
ca
help
it
peter
let
the
sheets
fall
from
his
hands
and
stared
out
of
the
little
window
the
gulls
were
screaming
and
fighting
over
some
refuse
in
the
harbour
and
he
watched
the
beat
of
their
wings
fascinated
if
only
he
too
could
catch
the
wind
and
be
up
and
away
like
that
he
jumped
up
and
paced
up
and
down
the
floor
restlessly
and
he
told
himself
that
hilda
was
right
and
he
was
a
cad
and
worse
julie
kiss
on
his
lips
burned
there
yet
that
at
any
rate
was
wrong
by
any
standards
he
had
no
right
to
behave
so
how
could
he
kiss
her
when
he
was
pledged
to
hilda
hilda
to
whom
everyone
had
looked
up
the
capable
irreproachable
hilda
the
hilda
to
whom
park
lane
and
john
were
such
admirable
setting
and
who
was
he
after
all
to
set
aside
all
that
for
which
both
those
things
stood
and
yet
he
sat
down
by
the
little
table
and
groaned
what
the
dickens
is
the
matter
with
you
padre
peter
started
and
looked
round
in
the
doorway
stood
pennell
regarding
him
with
amusement
here
am
i
trying
to
read
and
you
pacing
up
and
down
like
a
wild
beast
what
the
devil
up
the
devil
himself
that
what
up
said
peter
savagely
look
here
pen
come
on
down
town
and
let
have
a
spree
i
hate
this
place
and
this
infernal
camp
it
gets
on
my
nerves
i
must
have
a
change
will
you
come
it
my
do
i
with
you
old
thing
i
know
what
you
feel
like
i
get
like
that
myself
sometimes
it
a
pleasure
to
see
that
you
so
human
we
go
down
town
and
for
once
i
off
duty
till
i
ought
to
sleep
i
suppose
but
i
ca
so
come
away
with
you
i
wo
be
a
second
he
disappeared
peter
stood
for
a
moment
then
slipped
his
tunic
off
and
put
on
another
less
distinctive
of
his
office
he
crossed
to
the
desk
unlocked
it
and
reached
for
a
roll
of
notes
shoving
them
into
his
pocket
then
he
put
on
his
cap
took
a
stick
from
the
corner
and
went
out
into
the
passage
but
there
he
remembered
and
came
quickly
back
he
folded
hilda
letter
and
put
it
away
in
a
drawer
then
he
went
out
again
are
you
ready
pennell
he
called
the
two
of
them
left
camp
and
set
out
across
the
docks
as
they
crossed
a
bridge
a
cab
came
into
the
road
from
a
and
turned
in
their
direction
come
on
said
peter
anything
is
better
than
this
infernal
walk
over
this
always
let
hop
in
they
stopped
the
man
who
asked
where
to
drive
to
let
go
to
the
bretagne
first
and
get
a
drink
said
pennell
right
said
peter
any
old
thing
hôtel
de
la
bretagne
he
called
to
the
driver
they
set
off
at
some
sort
of
a
pace
and
pennell
leaned
back
with
a
laugh
it
a
funny
old
world
graham
he
said
one
does
get
at
times
why
sitting
in
a
funeral
show
like
this
cab
and
having
a
drink
in
a
pub
should
be
any
amusement
i
do
know
but
it
is
you
infectious
my
boy
i
begin
to
feel
like
a
rag
myself
what
shall
we
do
the
great
thing
said
peter
judiciously
is
not
to
know
what
one
is
going
to
do
but
just
to
take
anything
that
comes
along
i
remember
at
the
one
never
set
out
to
rag
anything
definitely
you
went
out
and
you
saw
a
bobby
and
you
took
his
hat
let
us
say
you
cleared
and
he
after
you
anything
might
happen
then
i
should
think
so
said
pennell
i
remember
once
walking
home
with
a
couple
of
men
and
one
of
them
suggested
dousing
all
the
street
lamps
in
the
road
which
was
a
residential
one
leading
into
town
there
was
anything
in
it
but
we
did
it
one
man
put
his
back
against
a
post
while
the
second
went
on
to
the
next
post
then
the
third
man
mounted
the
first
man
back
shoved
out
the
light
jumped
clear
and
ran
on
past
the
next
to
the
third
the
first
man
jumped
on
no
back
and
doused
his
lamp
and
so
on
we
did
the
street
in
a
few
minutes
and
then
a
constable
came
into
it
at
the
top
he
probably
thought
he
was
drunk
then
he
spotted
lights
going
out
and
like
an
ass
he
blew
his
whistle
we
were
round
a
corner
in
no
time
and
then
turned
and
ran
back
to
see
if
we
could
offer
assistance
some
gag
chuckled
pennell
but
i
hope
you
wo
go
on
that
sort
of
racket
it
would
be
a
little
more
serious
if
we
were
caught
also
these
blighted
gendarmes
would
probably
start
firing
or
some
other
damned
thing
they
would
said
peter
besides
that
does
appeal
to
me
now
getting
too
old
or
else
my
tastes
have
become
depraved
the
cab
stopped
with
a
jerk
hop
out
said
peter
he
settled
the
score
and
the
two
of
them
entered
the
hotel
and
passed
through
into
the
private
bar
what
is
it
to
be
demanded
pennell
cocktails
old
son
said
peter
i
want
bucking
up
what
do
you
say
to
martinis
the
other
agreed
and
they
moved
over
to
the
bar
a
monstrously
fat
woman
stood
behind
it
like
some
bloated
spider
and
a
thin
girl
assisted
her
a
couple
of
men
were
already
there
it
was
too
early
for
official
drinks
but
the
bretagne
knew
no
law
they
ordered
their
drinks
and
stood
there
while
madame
compounded
them
and
put
in
the
cherries
another
man
came
in
and
peter
recognised
the
australian
ferrars
whom
he
had
met
before
he
introduced
pennell
and
called
for
another
martini
so
you
frequent
this
do
you
said
ferrars
not
much
laughed
peter
but
it
convenient
it
is
and
it
a
good
sign
when
a
man
like
you
wants
a
drink
sooner
listen
to
your
sermons
any
day
than
some
chaps
i
know
subject
barred
here
said
pennell
but
here
the
very
best
to
you
graham
for
all
that
same
here
said
ferrars
and
put
down
his
empty
glass
the
talk
became
general
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
it
mild
chaffing
a
yarn
or
two
a
guarded
description
by
peter
of
his
motor
drive
from
abbeville
and
then
more
drinks
and
so
on
the
atmosphere
was
warm
and
genial
but
peter
wondered
inwardly
why
he
liked
it
and
he
did
not
like
it
so
much
that
pennell
well
what
about
it
let
go
on
graham
shall
we
found
him
unready
the
two
said
a
general
promised
madame
to
look
in
again
and
sauntered
out
they
crossed
the
square
in
front
of
travalini
lingered
at
the
refused
the
girls
pressure
to
buy
and
strolled
on
i
sick
of
travalini
said
pennell
do
let
go
in
there
so
am
i
said
peter
let
stroll
down
towards
the
sea
they
turned
down
a
and
stood
for
a
few
minutes
looking
into
a
picture
and
book
shop
at
that
moment
quick
footsteps
sounded
on
the
pavement
and
pennell
glanced
round
two
girls
passed
them
obviously
sisters
they
were
not
flashily
dressed
exactly
but
there
was
something
in
their
furs
and
their
boots
that
told
its
own
story
by
jove
that
a
pretty
girl
exclaimed
pennell
let
follow
them
peter
laughed
he
was
reckless
but
not
utterly
so
if
you
like
he
said
i
on
for
any
rag
we
take
them
for
a
drink
but
i
stop
at
that
mind
pen
sure
thing
said
pennell
but
come
on
we
miss
them
they
set
out
after
the
girls
who
after
one
glance
back
walked
on
as
if
they
did
not
know
they
were
being
followed
but
they
walked
slowly
and
it
was
easy
for
the
two
men
to
catch
them
up
peter
slackened
a
few
paces
behind
look
here
pen
he
said
what
the
deuce
are
we
going
to
do
they
expect
more
than
a
drink
you
know
oh
no
they
wo
not
so
early
as
this
it
all
in
the
way
of
business
to
them
too
let
pass
them
first
he
suggested
and
then
slacken
down
and
wait
for
them
to
speak
peter
acquiesced
feeling
rather
more
than
an
ass
but
the
drinks
had
gone
slightly
to
his
head
they
executed
their
share
of
the
maneuver
pennell
looking
at
the
girls
and
smiling
as
he
did
so
but
the
two
quickened
their
pace
and
passed
the
officers
without
a
word
if
you
ask
me
this
is
damned
silly
said
peter
let
chuck
it
no
no
wait
a
bit
said
pennell
excitedly
you
see
what
do
it
really
an
amusing
study
in
human
nature
look
i
told
you
so
they
live
there
the
girls
had
crossed
the
street
and
were
entering
a
house
one
of
them
unlocked
the
door
and
they
both
disappeared
there
said
peter
that
finishes
it
we
lost
them
have
we
said
his
companion
come
on
over
they
crossed
the
street
and
walked
up
to
the
door
it
was
open
and
perhaps
a
foot
ajar
pennell
pushed
it
wide
and
walked
in
come
on
he
said
again
peter
followed
reluctantly
but
curious
he
was
seeing
a
new
side
of
life
he
thought
grimly
before
them
a
flight
of
stairs
led
straight
up
to
a
landing
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
girls
what
next
demanded
peter
we
be
fired
out
in
two
twos
if
nothing
worse
happens
suppose
they
decent
girls
after
all
what
would
you
say
i
ask
if
mlle
lucienne
lived
here
said
pennell
and
apologise
profusely
when
i
found
she
did
but
you
ca
make
a
mistake
in
this
street
graham
i
going
up
it
the
obvious
thing
and
probably
what
they
wanted
coming
he
set
off
to
mount
the
stairs
and
peter
reassured
followed
him
at
a
few
paces
when
he
reached
the
top
pennell
was
already
entering
an
open
door
how
do
you
do
ma
chérie
said
one
of
the
girls
smiling
and
holding
out
a
hand
peter
looked
round
curiously
the
room
was
fairly
decently
furnished
in
a
foreign
fashion
half
bedroom
half
one
of
the
girls
sat
on
the
arm
of
a
big
chair
the
other
was
greeting
his
friend
she
was
the
one
he
had
fancied
but
a
quick
glance
attracted
peter
to
the
other
and
elder
he
was
in
for
it
now
and
he
was
determined
to
play
up
he
crossed
the
floor
and
smiled
down
at
the
girl
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
so
you
come
she
said
in
broken
english
i
told
lucienne
that
you
would
not
lucienne
exclaimed
peter
and
looked
back
at
pennell
that
traitor
laughed
and
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
drawing
the
other
girl
to
him
i
awfully
sorry
graham
he
said
but
i
could
help
it
you
wanted
to
see
life
and
you
have
shied
off
if
i
had
played
a
game
i
do
just
know
this
little
girl
and
jolly
nice
she
is
too
give
me
a
kiss
lulu
the
girl
obeyed
her
eyes
sparkling
it
not
proper
before
monsieur
she
said
is
how
do
you
say
shocked
she
seated
herself
on
pennell
knee
and
putting
an
arm
round
his
neck
kissed
him
again
looking
across
at
peter
mischievously
we
show
french
kiss
she
added
to
pennell
and
pouted
out
her
lips
to
his
well
now
you
come
what
do
you
want
demanded
the
girl
on
the
arm
of
peter
chair
sit
down
she
said
imperiously
patting
the
seat
and
talk
to
me
peter
laughed
more
lightly
than
he
felt
well
i
want
a
drink
he
said
at
random
pen
he
called
across
the
room
what
about
that
drink
the
girl
by
him
reached
over
and
touched
a
bell
as
she
did
so
peter
saw
the
curls
that
clustered
on
her
neck
and
caught
the
perfume
of
her
hair
it
was
penetrating
and
peculiar
but
not
distasteful
and
it
did
all
that
it
was
meant
to
do
he
bent
and
kissed
the
back
of
her
neck
still
marvelling
at
himself
she
straightened
herself
smiling
that
is
better
you
are
so
cold
as
you
pretended
chérie
now
kiss
me
properly
and
she
held
up
her
face
peter
kissed
her
lips
before
he
knew
it
a
pair
of
arms
were
thrown
about
his
neck
and
he
was
being
with
kisses
he
tore
himself
away
disgusted
and
ashamed
no
he
cried
sharply
but
knowing
that
it
was
too
late
the
girl
threw
herself
back
laughing
merrily
oh
you
are
funny
she
said
lucienne
take
your
boy
away
i
want
to
talk
to
mine
before
he
could
think
of
a
remonstrance
it
was
done
pennell
and
the
other
girl
got
up
from
the
bed
where
they
had
been
whispering
together
and
left
the
room
pennell
called
peter
too
late
again
jumping
up
the
girl
ran
round
him
pushed
the
door
to
locked
it
and
dropped
the
key
down
the
neck
of
her
dress
voila
she
said
gaily
there
came
a
knock
on
the
door
non
non
she
cried
in
french
take
the
wine
to
mlle
lucienne
i
am
busy
peter
walked
across
the
room
to
her
give
me
the
key
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
and
changing
his
tactics
please
do
i
wo
go
till
my
friend
comes
back
i
promise
the
girl
looked
at
him
you
promise
but
you
will
to
find
it
he
smiled
and
nodded
and
she
walked
deliberately
to
the
bed
undid
the
front
of
her
costume
and
slipped
it
off
bare
necked
and
armed
she
turned
to
him
holding
open
the
front
of
her
chemise
down
there
she
said
it
was
a
strange
moment
and
a
strange
thing
but
a
curious
courage
came
back
to
peter
in
that
second
without
hesitation
he
put
his
hand
down
and
sought
for
the
key
against
her
warm
body
he
found
it
and
help
it
up
smiling
then
he
moved
to
the
door
pushed
the
key
in
the
keyhole
and
turned
again
to
the
girl
there
he
said
simply
with
a
gesture
of
abandon
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
propping
her
cheek
on
her
hand
and
staring
at
him
he
sat
down
where
pennell
had
sat
but
made
no
attempt
to
touch
her
leaning
instead
back
and
away
against
the
iron
she
pulled
up
her
knees
flung
her
arms
back
and
laughed
and
now
monsieur
she
said
peter
had
never
felt
so
cool
in
his
life
his
thoughts
raced
but
steadily
as
if
he
had
dived
into
cold
clear
water
he
smiled
again
unhesitatingly
but
sadly
dear
he
said
deliberately
listen
to
me
i
have
cheated
you
by
coming
here
though
you
sha
suffer
for
it
i
did
not
want
anything
and
i
do
now
but
i
glad
i
come
even
though
you
do
not
understand
i
do
want
to
do
a
bit
what
my
friend
is
doing
i
do
know
why
but
i
do
i
engaged
to
a
girl
in
england
but
it
not
because
of
that
i
a
chaplain
too
a
curé
you
know
in
the
english
army
but
it
not
because
of
that
protestant
demanded
the
girl
on
the
bed
he
nodded
ah
well
she
said
the
protestant
ministers
have
wives
they
are
men
it
is
different
with
priests
if
your
fiancée
is
wise
she
would
mind
if
you
love
me
a
little
she
is
in
england
i
am
here
is
it
not
so
you
love
me
now
again
perhaps
once
or
twice
then
it
is
finished
you
do
not
tell
your
fiancée
and
she
does
not
know
it
is
no
matter
come
on
chérie
she
held
out
her
hands
and
threw
her
head
back
on
the
pillow
peter
smiled
again
you
do
not
understand
he
said
and
nor
do
i
but
i
must
be
different
from
some
men
i
do
not
want
to
ah
well
she
exclaimed
brightly
sitting
up
another
time
give
me
my
dress
monsieur
le
curé
he
got
up
and
handed
it
to
her
tell
me
he
said
do
you
like
this
sort
of
life
she
shrugged
her
white
shoulders
indifferently
sometimes
she
said
sometimes
not
there
are
good
boys
and
bad
boys
some
are
rough
cruel
mean
some
are
kind
and
remember
that
it
costs
much
to
live
these
days
and
one
must
dress
nicely
see
she
said
deliberately
showing
him
it
is
lace
fine
lace
i
pay
fifty
francs
in
paris
i
will
give
you
that
said
peter
and
he
placed
the
note
on
the
bed
she
stared
at
it
and
at
him
oh
i
love
you
she
cried
you
are
kind
ah
now
if
i
could
but
love
you
always
always
he
demanded
yes
always
always
while
you
are
here
in
le
havre
i
would
have
no
other
boy
but
you
ah
if
you
would
you
do
not
know
how
one
tires
of
the
the
drinks
the
smiles
i
would
do
just
all
you
please
be
gay
be
solemn
talk
be
silent
just
as
you
please
oh
if
you
would
half
in
and
half
out
of
her
dress
she
stood
there
pleading
peter
looked
closely
at
the
little
face
with
its
rouge
and
powder
you
hate
that
she
exclaimed
with
quick
intuition
see
it
is
gone
i
use
it
no
more
only
a
leetle
leetle
for
the
night
and
she
ran
across
to
the
basin
dipped
a
little
sponge
in
water
passed
it
over
her
face
and
turned
to
him
triumphantly
peter
sighed
little
girl
he
said
sadly
hardly
knowing
that
he
spoke
i
can
not
save
myself
how
can
i
save
you
pouf
she
cried
save
what
do
you
mean
she
drew
herself
up
with
an
absurd
gesture
you
think
me
a
bad
girl
no
i
am
not
bad
i
go
to
church
le
bon
dieu
made
us
as
we
are
it
is
nécessaire
they
stood
before
each
other
a
strange
pair
the
product
of
a
strange
age
god
knows
what
the
angels
made
of
it
but
at
any
rate
peter
was
honest
he
thought
of
julie
and
he
would
not
cast
a
stone
there
came
a
light
knock
at
the
door
the
girl
disregarded
it
and
ran
to
him
you
will
come
again
she
said
in
low
tones
promise
me
that
you
will
i
will
not
ask
you
for
anything
you
can
do
as
you
please
but
come
again
do
come
again
peter
passed
his
hand
over
her
hair
i
will
come
if
i
can
he
said
but
the
lord
knows
why
the
knock
came
again
a
little
louder
the
girl
smiled
and
held
her
face
up
kiss
me
she
demanded
he
complied
and
she
darted
away
fumbling
with
her
dress
i
come
she
called
and
opened
the
door
lucienne
and
pennell
came
in
and
the
two
men
exchanged
glances
then
pennell
looked
away
lucienne
glanced
at
them
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
come
graham
said
pennell
let
get
out
you
two
the
pair
of
them
went
down
and
out
in
silence
no
one
had
seen
them
come
and
there
was
no
one
to
see
them
go
peter
glanced
at
the
number
and
made
a
mental
note
of
it
and
they
set
off
down
the
street
presently
pennell
laughed
i
played
you
a
dirty
trick
graham
he
said
i
sorry
you
need
be
said
peter
i
very
glad
i
went
why
said
pennell
curiously
glancing
sideways
at
him
you
a
queer
fellow
graham
but
there
was
a
note
of
relief
in
his
tone
peter
said
nothing
but
walked
on
where
next
demanded
pennell
it
looks
as
if
you
are
directing
this
outfit
said
peter
i
in
your
hands
all
right
said
pennell
i
know
they
took
a
street
running
parallel
to
the
docks
and
entered
an
american
bar
peter
glanced
round
curiously
i
never
been
here
before
he
said
probably
not
said
pennell
it
not
much
at
this
time
of
the
year
but
jolly
cool
in
the
summer
and
you
can
get
cocktails
i
want
something
now
what
yours
i
leave
it
to
you
said
peter
he
sat
down
at
a
little
table
rather
in
the
corner
and
lit
a
cigarette
the
place
was
well
lighted
and
by
means
of
mirrors
ornaments
paper
decorations
and
a
few
palms
it
looked
in
its
own
way
smart
two
or
three
officers
were
drinking
at
the
bar
sitting
on
high
stools
and
pennell
went
up
to
give
his
order
he
brought
two
glasses
to
peter
table
and
sat
down
what
fools
we
are
padre
he
said
i
sometimes
think
that
the
man
who
gets
simply
and
definitely
tight
when
he
feels
he
wants
a
breather
is
wiser
than
most
of
us
we
drink
till
excited
and
then
we
drink
to
get
over
it
and
i
suppose
the
devil
sits
and
grins
well
it
a
weary
world
and
there
is
any
good
road
out
of
it
i
sometimes
wish
i
stopped
a
bullet
earlier
on
in
the
day
and
yet
i
do
know
we
do
get
some
excitement
let
go
to
a
what
about
dinner
oh
get
a
quiet
one
in
a
decent
hotel
i
have
to
clear
out
at
if
you
do
mind
not
a
bit
said
peter
half
will
be
enough
for
me
i
think
but
have
dinner
before
we
had
more
of
these
things
the
bar
was
filling
up
a
few
girls
came
and
went
pennell
nodded
to
a
man
or
two
and
finished
his
glass
and
they
went
off
to
dinner
the
was
not
much
of
a
show
but
it
glittered
and
people
obviously
enjoyed
it
peter
watched
the
audience
as
much
as
the
stage
quite
respectable
french
families
were
there
and
there
was
nothing
done
that
might
not
have
been
done
on
an
english
stage
perhaps
less
but
the
words
were
different
the
women
as
well
as
the
men
screamed
with
laughter
flushed
of
face
but
an
old
fellow
with
his
wife
and
daughter
obviously
from
the
country
sat
as
stiffly
as
an
english
farmer
through
it
all
the
daughter
glanced
once
at
the
two
officers
but
then
looked
away
she
was
well
brought
up
a
algerian
probably
came
on
and
danced
really
extraordinarily
well
and
a
negro
from
the
states
equally
ready
in
french
and
english
sang
songs
which
the
audience
demanded
he
was
entirely
master
however
and
conscious
of
his
power
used
it
no
one
in
the
place
seemed
to
have
heard
of
the
except
a
couple
of
americans
who
got
up
and
walked
out
when
the
comedian
clasped
a
white
girl
round
the
waist
in
one
of
his
songs
the
negro
made
some
remark
that
peter
could
catch
and
the
place
shook
with
laughter
at
everyone
flocked
into
a
queer
kind
of
hall
whose
walls
were
painted
to
represent
a
cave
dingy
cork
festoons
and
rocks
adding
to
the
illusion
here
at
long
tables
everyone
drank
innocuous
french
beer
that
was
really
quite
cool
and
good
it
was
rather
like
part
of
an
english
bank
holiday
everybody
spoke
to
everybody
else
and
there
were
no
classes
and
distinctions
you
could
only
get
one
glass
of
beer
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
were
too
many
drinking
and
too
few
supplying
the
drinks
for
more
in
the
time
i
must
go
said
pennell
but
do
you
bother
to
come
oh
yes
i
will
said
peter
and
they
got
up
together
in
the
however
a
girl
was
apparently
waiting
for
someone
and
as
they
passed
peter
recognised
her
louise
he
exclaimed
she
smiled
and
held
out
her
hand
peter
took
it
and
pennell
after
him
do
you
go
now
she
asked
them
the
concert
is
not
half
finished
i
got
to
get
back
to
work
said
pennell
worse
luck
it
is
la
guerre
you
know
poor
boy
said
she
gaily
and
you
turning
to
peter
moved
by
an
impulse
he
shook
his
head
no
he
said
i
was
only
seeing
him
home
bien
see
me
home
instead
then
said
louise
nothing
doing
said
peter
using
a
familiar
phrase
she
laughed
bah
can
not
a
girl
have
friends
without
that
eh
you
have
a
fiancée
you
not
oh
yes
i
remember
i
remember
very
well
come
i
have
done
for
i
am
tired
i
will
make
you
some
coffee
and
we
shall
talk
is
it
not
so
peter
looked
at
pennell
do
you
mind
pen
he
asked
i
rather
like
to
not
a
scrap
said
the
other
cheerfully
wish
i
could
come
too
ask
me
another
day
louise
will
you
she
regarded
him
with
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
i
do
not
know
she
said
i
do
not
think
you
would
talk
with
me
as
he
will
you
like
what
you
can
get
from
the
girls
of
france
now
but
after
no
more
monsieur
is
different
he
want
not
quite
the
same
oh
i
know
allons
pennell
shrugged
his
shoulders
one
for
me
he
said
well
i
hope
you
both
enjoy
yourselves
in
five
minutes
peter
and
louise
were
walking
together
down
the
street
a
few
glanced
at
them
or
especially
at
her
but
she
took
no
notice
and
peter
in
a
little
felt
the
strangeness
of
it
all
much
less
he
deliberately
crossed
once
or
twice
to
get
between
her
and
the
road
as
he
would
have
done
with
a
lady
and
moved
slightly
in
front
of
her
when
they
encountered
two
drunken
men
she
chatted
about
nothing
in
particular
and
peter
thought
to
himself
that
he
might
almost
have
been
escorting
hilda
home
but
if
hilda
had
seen
him
she
ushered
him
into
her
flat
it
was
cosy
and
nicely
furnished
very
different
from
that
of
the
afternoon
a
photograph
or
two
stood
about
in
silver
frames
a
few
a
little
table
a
bookshelf
and
a
cupboard
a
fire
was
alight
in
the
grate
louise
knelt
down
and
poked
it
into
a
flame
you
shall
have
french
coffee
she
said
and
i
have
even
lait
for
you
she
put
a
copper
kettle
on
the
fire
and
busied
herself
with
cups
and
saucers
these
she
arranged
on
the
little
table
and
drew
it
near
the
fire
then
she
offered
him
a
cigarette
from
a
gold
case
and
took
one
herself
ah
she
said
sinking
back
into
a
chair
now
we
are
as
you
say
comfy
is
it
not
so
we
can
talk
tell
me
how
you
like
la
france
and
what
you
do
peter
tried
but
failed
rather
miserably
and
the
shrewd
french
girl
noticed
it
easily
enough
she
all
but
interrupted
him
as
he
talked
of
abbeville
and
the
raid
mon
ami
she
said
you
have
something
on
your
mind
you
do
not
want
to
talk
of
these
things
tell
me
peter
looked
into
the
kindly
keen
eyes
you
are
right
louise
he
said
this
is
a
day
of
trouble
for
me
she
nodded
tell
me
she
said
again
but
first
what
is
your
name
mon
ami
it
is
hard
to
talk
if
one
does
not
know
even
the
name
he
hardly
hesitated
it
seemed
natural
to
say
it
peter
he
said
she
smiled
rolling
the
peterr
well
peterr
go
on
i
tell
you
about
first
he
said
and
once
launched
did
so
easily
he
told
the
little
story
well
and
presently
forgot
the
strange
surroundings
it
was
all
but
a
confession
and
surely
one
was
never
more
strangely
made
and
from
the
story
he
spoke
of
julie
but
concealed
her
identity
and
then
he
spoke
of
god
louise
hardly
said
a
word
she
poured
out
coffee
in
the
middle
but
that
was
all
at
last
he
finished
louise
he
said
it
comes
to
this
i
nothing
left
but
julie
it
was
she
restrained
me
this
afternoon
i
think
i
mad
for
her
i
want
her
and
nothing
else
but
with
her
somehow
i
lose
everything
else
i
possess
or
ever
thought
i
possessed
and
he
stopped
abruptly
for
she
did
not
know
his
business
in
life
and
he
had
almost
given
it
away
when
he
had
finished
she
slipped
a
hand
into
his
and
said
no
word
suddenly
she
looked
up
peterr
mon
ami
she
said
listen
to
me
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
louise
of
me
my
father
he
lived
oh
it
matters
not
but
he
had
some
money
he
was
not
poor
i
went
to
a
good
school
and
i
came
home
for
the
holidays
i
had
one
sister
older
than
me
presently
i
grew
up
i
learnt
much
i
noticed
i
saw
there
were
terrible
things
chez
nous
my
mother
did
not
care
but
i
i
cared
i
was
mad
i
spoke
to
my
sister
it
was
no
good
i
spoke
to
my
father
and
truly
i
thought
he
would
kill
me
he
beat
me
ah
terrible
and
i
ran
from
the
house
i
wept
under
the
hedges
i
said
i
would
no
more
go
i
come
to
a
big
city
i
found
work
in
a
big
shop
much
work
little
money
ah
how
little
then
i
met
a
friend
he
persuade
me
at
last
he
keep
me
two
months
three
or
more
then
comes
the
war
he
is
an
officer
and
he
goes
we
kiss
we
part
oui
he
love
me
that
officer
i
pray
for
him
i
think
i
nevair
leave
the
church
but
it
is
no
good
he
is
dead
then
i
curse
le
bon
dieu
they
know
me
in
that
place
i
can
do
nothing
unless
i
will
go
to
an
to
be
for
the
officers
you
understand
i
say
non
i
sell
my
things
and
i
come
here
here
i
do
well
you
understand
i
am
careful
i
have
now
my
home
but
this
is
what
i
tell
you
peterr
one
does
wrong
to
curse
le
bon
dieu
he
is
wise
ah
how
wise
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
and
good
ah
jesu
how
good
you
think
i
do
not

i
how

but
i
know
i
do
not

for
me
i
am
caught
i
am
like
the
bird
in
the
cage
i
can
not
get
out
so
i
smile
i
laugh
and
i
wait
she
ceased
peter
was
strangely
moved
and
he
pressed
the
hand
he
held
almost
fiercely
the
tragedy
of
her
life
seemed
so
great
that
he
hardly
dare
speak
of
his
own
but
what
has
it
to
do
with
me
he
demanded
she
gave
a
little
laugh
should
i
say
she
said
but
you
think
god
not
remember
you
and
peterr
he
remember
all
the
time
and
julie
quizzed
peter
after
a
moment
louise
shrugged
her
shoulders
this
love
she
said
it
is
one
great
thing
for
us
women
it
is
perhaps
the
only
great
thing
though
your
english
women
are
blind
are
dead
they
do
not
see
julie
she
is
as
us
i
think
she
is
french
inside
la
pauvre
petite
she
is
french
in
the
heart
well
demanded
peter
again
tout
mon
ami
but
i
am
sorry
for
julie
louise
said
peter
impulsively
you
better
than
i
a
thousand
times
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
and
he
lifted
her
hand
to
his
lips
he
hardly
touched
it
she
sprang
up
withdrawing
it
ah
non
non
she
cried
you
must
not
you
forget
it
is
easy
for
you
for
you
are
good
yes
so
good
you
think
i
did
not
notice
in
the
street
but
i
see
you
treat
me
like
a
lady
and
now
you
kiss
my
hand
the
hand
of
the
girl
of
the
street
non
non
she
protested
vehemently
her
eyes
alight
i
would
kiss
your
feet
outside
in
the
darkened
street
peter
walked
slowly
home
at
the
gate
of
the
camp
he
met
arnold
returning
from
a
visit
to
another
mess
hullo
he
called
to
peter
and
where
have
you
been
peter
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
without
replying
not
sure
but
seeing
for
the
first
time
a
little
of
what
christ
saw
arnold
i
think
he
said
at
last
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
chapter
iv
looking
back
on
them
afterwards
peter
saw
the
months
that
followed
as
a
time
of
waiting
between
two
periods
of
stress
not
of
course
that
anyone
can
ever
stand
still
for
even
if
one
does
but
sit
by
a
fire
and
warm
one
hands
things
happen
and
one
is
imperceptibly
led
forward
it
was
so
in
this
case
but
not
unnaturally
graham
hardly
noticed
in
what
way
his
mind
was
moving
he
had
been
through
a
period
of
storm
and
he
had
to
a
certain
extent
emerged
from
it
the
men
he
had
met
and
above
all
julie
had
been
responsible
for
the
opening
of
his
eyes
to
facts
that
he
had
before
passed
over
and
it
was
entirely
to
his
credit
that
he
would
not
refuse
to
accept
them
and
act
upon
them
but
once
he
had
resolved
to
do
so
things
as
it
were
slowed
down
he
went
about
his
work
in
a
new
spirit
the
spirit
not
of
the
teacher
but
of
the
learner
and
ever
since
his
talk
with
louise
he
thought
or
tried
to
think
more
of
what
love
might
mean
to
julie
than
to
himself
the
result
was
a
curious
change
in
their
relations
of
which
the
girl
was
more
immediately
and
continually
conscious
than
peter
she
puzzled
over
it
but
could
not
get
the
clue
and
her
quest
irritated
her
peter
had
always
been
the
least
little
bit
nervous
in
her
presence
she
had
known
that
he
never
knew
what
she
would
do
or
say
next
and
her
knowledge
had
amused
and
carried
her
away
but
now
he
was
so
very
friendly
they
were
and
they
met
often
in
the
ward
for
a
few
sentences
that
meant
much
to
each
of
them
down
town
by
arrangement
in
a
cafe
or
once
or
twice
for
dinner
and
once
for
a
day
in
the
country
though
not
alone
and
he
was
always
the
same
sometimes
on
night
duty
she
would
grope
for
an
adjective
to
fit
him
and
could
only
think
of
tender
he
was
that
and
she
hated
it
or
all
but
hated
it
she
did
not
want
tenderness
from
him
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
tenderness
meant
that
he
was
as
it
were
standing
aloof
from
her
considering
helping
when
he
could
she
demanded
the
fierce
rush
of
passion
with
which
he
would
seize
and
shrine
her
in
the
centre
of
his
heart
deaf
to
her
entreaties
careless
of
her
pain
she
would
love
then
she
thought
and
sometimes
going
to
the
window
of
the
ward
and
staring
out
over
the
harbour
at
the
twinkling
lights
she
would
bite
her
lip
with
the
pain
of
it
he
had
thought
she
dismissed
love
lightly
when
she
called
it
animal
passion
good
god
if
he
only
knew
peter
for
his
part
did
not
realise
so
completely
the
change
that
had
come
over
him
for
one
thing
he
saw
himself
all
the
time
and
she
did
not
she
did
not
see
him
when
he
lay
on
his
bed
in
a
tense
agony
of
desire
for
her
she
did
not
see
him
when
life
looked
like
a
tumbled
heap
of
ruins
to
him
and
she
smiled
beyond
she
all
but
only
saw
him
when
he
was
staring
at
the
images
that
had
been
presented
to
him
during
the
past
months
or
hearing
in
imagination
louise
quaintly
accepted
english
and
her
quick
and
vivid
la
pauvre
petite
for
it
was
louise
curiously
enough
who
affected
him
most
in
these
days
a
friendship
sprang
up
between
them
of
which
no
one
knew
pennell
and
donovan
with
whom
he
went
everywhere
did
not
speak
of
it
either
to
him
or
to
one
another
with
that
real
chivalry
that
is
in
most
men
but
if
they
had
they
would
have
blundered
misunderstanding
arnold
of
whom
peter
saw
a
good
deal
did
not
know
or
if
he
knew
peter
never
knew
that
he
knew
julie
who
was
well
aware
of
his
friendship
with
the
two
first
men
knew
that
he
saw
french
girls
and
indeed
openly
chaffed
him
about
it
but
under
her
chaff
was
an
anxiety
typical
of
her
she
did
not
know
how
far
he
went
in
their
company
and
she
would
have
given
anything
to
know
she
guessed
that
despite
everything
he
had
had
no
physical
relationship
with
any
one
of
them
and
she
almost
wished
it
might
be
otherwise
she
knew
well
that
if
he
fell
to
them
he
would
the
more
readily
turn
to
her
there
was
a
strength
about
him
now
that
she
dreaded
whatever
louise
thought
she
kept
wonderfully
hidden
he
took
her
out
to
dinner
in
quiet
places
and
she
would
take
him
home
to
coffee
and
they
would
chat
and
there
was
an
end
she
was
seemingly
well
content
she
did
her
business
and
they
would
even
speak
of
it
i
can
not
come
mon
ami
she
would
say
i
am
busy
she
would
nod
to
him
as
she
passed
out
of
the
restaurant
with
someone
else
and
he
would
smile
back
at
her
nor
did
he
ever
remonstrate
or
urge
her
to
change
her
ways
and
she
knew
why
he
had
no
key
with
which
to
open
her
cage
once
truly
he
attempted
it
and
it
was
she
who
refused
the
glittering
thing
he
rarely
came
uninvited
to
her
flat
for
obvious
reasons
but
one
night
she
heard
him
on
the
stairs
as
she
got
ready
for
bed
he
was
walking
unsteadily
and
she
thought
at
first
that
he
had
been
drinking
she
opened
to
him
with
the
carelessness
her
life
had
taught
her
her
costume
off
and
her
black
hair
all
about
her
shoulders
go
in
and
wait
peterr
she
said
i
come
she
had
slipped
on
a
coloured
silk
wrap
and
gone
in
to
the
to
find
him
pacing
up
and
down
she
smiled
sit
down
mon
ami
she
said
i
will
make
the
coffee
see
it
is
ready
mais
vraiment
you
shall
drink
café
noir
and
one
leetle
glass
of
this
is
it
not
so
and
she
took
a
green
bottle
of
peppermint
liqueur
from
the
cupboard
coffee
louise
he
said
but
not
the
other
i
do
want
it
she
turned
and
looked
more
closely
at
him
then
non
she
said
pardon
but
sit
you
down
am
i
to
have
the
wild
beast
prowling
up
and
down
in
my
place
that
just
it
louise
he
cried
i
am
a
wild
beast
i
stand
it
any
longer
kiss
me
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
bent
her
head
back
studying
her
french
and
rather
inscrutable
eyes
her
dark
lashes
her
mobile
mouth
her
long
white
throat
he
put
his
hand
caressingly
upon
it
and
slid
his
fingers
beneath
the
loose
lace
that
the
open
wrap
exposed
dear
he
said
i
want
you
chérie
she
questioned
yes
now
he
said
hotly
and
why
not
you
give
to
other
men
why
not
to
me
louise
she
freed
herself
with
a
quick
gesture
and
brave
heart
she
laughed
merrily
the
devil
must
have
started
at
that
laugh
and
the
angels
of
god
sung
for
joy
ah
non
she
cried
it
is
the
mistake
you
make
i
myself
to
other
men
but
you
you
are
my
friend
i
can
not
sell
myself
to
you
he
did
not
understand
altogether
why
she
quibbled
how
should
he
have
done
but
lie
was
ashamed
he
slid
into
the
familiar
chair
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
forgive
me
dear
he
muttered
i
think
i
am
mad
but
i
am
not
drunk
as
you
thought
except
with
worrying
i
feel
lost
unclean
body
and
soul
and
i
thought
you
would
help
me
to
forget
no
more
than
that
help
me
to
feel
a
man
ca
you
wo
you
he
demanded
looking
up
i
am
tired
of
i
a
body
like
other
men
let
me
plunge
down
deep
louise
it
will
do
me
good
and
it
does
matter
that
girl
was
right
after
all
oh
what
a
fool
i
am
then
did
the
girl
of
the
streets
set
out
to
play
her
chosen
part
she
did
not
preach
at
all
how
could
she
besides
neither
had
she
any
use
for
the
ten
commandments
but
if
ever
magdalene
broke
an
of
very
precious
ointment
louise
did
so
that
night
she
was
worldly
wise
and
she
did
not
disdain
to
use
her
wisdom
and
when
he
had
gone
she
got
calmly
into
bed
and
slept
not
all
at
once
it
is
true
but
as
resolutely
as
she
had
laughed
and
talked
it
was
only
when
she
woke
in
the
morning
that
she
found
her
pillow
wet
with
tears
it
was
a
few
days
later
that
louise
took
peter
to
church
his
ignorance
of
her
religion
greatly
amused
her
or
so
at
least
she
pretended
and
when
he
asked
her
to
come
out
of
town
to
lunch
one
morning
and
she
refused
because
it
was
corpus
christi
and
she
wanted
to
go
to
the
sung
mass
it
was
he
who
suggested
that
he
should
go
with
her
she
looked
at
him
queerly
a
moment
and
then
agreed
they
met
outside
the
church
and
went
in
together
as
strange
a
pair
as
ever
the
meshes
of
that
ancient
net
which
gathers
of
all
kinds
had
ever
drawn
towards
the
shore
louise
led
him
to
a
central
seat
and
found
the
place
for
him
in
her
the
building
was
full
and
peter
glanced
about
him
curiously
the
detachment
of
the
worshippers
impressed
him
immensely
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
proscribed
procedure
among
them
and
even
when
the
mass
began
he
was
one
of
the
few
who
stood
and
knelt
as
the
rubrics
of
the
service
directed
louise
made
no
attempt
to
do
so
for
the
most
part
she
knelt
and
her
beads
trickled
ceaselessly
through
her
fingers
peter
was
if
anything
bored
by
the
mass
though
he
would
not
admit
it
to
himself
it
struck
him
as
being
a
ratherly
poorly
played
performance
true
the
officiating
ministers
moved
and
spoke
with
a
calm
regularity
which
impressed
him
familiar
as
he
was
with
clergymen
who
gave
out
hymns
and
notices
and
with
his
own
solicitude
at
home
that
the
singing
should
go
well
or
that
the
choirboys
should
not
fidget
but
there
was
a
terrible
confusion
with
chairs
and
a
hideous
kind
of
clapper
that
was
used
apparently
to
warn
the
boys
to
sit
and
rise
the
service
moreover
as
a
reverential
congregational
act
of
worship
such
as
he
was
used
to
hope
for
was
marred
by
innumerable
collections
and
especially
by
the
old
woman
who
came
round
even
during
the
to
collect
the
rent
of
the
chairs
they
occupied
and
changed
money
or
announced
prices
with
all
the
zest
of
the
but
at
the
close
there
was
a
procession
which
is
worth
considerable
description
six
men
with
censers
of
silver
lined
up
before
the
high
altar
and
stood
there
slowly
swinging
the
fragrant
bowls
at
the
end
of
their
long
chains
the
music
died
down
one
could
hear
the
rhythmical
faint
clangour
of
the
metal
and
then
intensely
sudden
away
in
the
west
gallery
but
almost
as
if
from
the
battlements
of
heaven
pealed
out
silver
trumpets
in
a
fanfare
the
censers
flew
high
in
time
with
it
and
the
sweet
clouds
of
smoke
caught
by
the
coloured
sunlight
of
the
rich
painted
windows
unfolded
in
the
air
of
the
sanctuary
lights
moved
and
danced
and
the
space
before
the
altar
filled
with
the
white
of
the
men
and
boys
who
should
move
in
the
procession
again
and
again
those
trumpets
rang
out
and
hardly
had
the
last
echoes
died
away
than
the
organ
thundered
the
as
a
priest
in
cloth
of
gold
turned
from
the
altar
with
the
glittering
monstrance
in
his
hand
even
from
where
he
stood
peter
could
see
the
white
centre
of
the
host
for
whom
all
this
was
enacted
then
the
canopy
borne
by
four
french
laymen
in
and
white
gloves
hid
it
from
his
sight
and
the
high
gold
cross
and
its
attendant
tapers
swung
round
a
great
buttress
into
view
peter
had
never
heard
a
hymn
sung
so
before
first
the
organ
would
peal
alone
then
the
men
voices
unaided
would
take
up
the
refrain
then
the
organ
again
then
the
clear
treble
of
the
boys
then
like
waves
breaking
on
immemorial
cliffs
organ
trumpets
boys
men
and
congregation
would
thunder
out
together
till
the
blood
raced
in
his
veins
and
his
eyes
were
too
dim
to
see
down
the
central
aisle
at
last
they
came
and
peter
knelt
with
the
rest
he
saw
how
the
boys
went
before
throwing
flowers
how
in
pairs
as
the
censers
were
recharged
the
thurifers
walked
backward
before
the
three
beneath
the
canopy
of
whom
one
and
old
bore
that
in
the
monstrance
which
all
adored
in
music
and
light
and
colour
and
scent
the
host
went
by
as
it
had
gone
for
centuries
in
that
ancient
place
and
peter
knew
all
bewildered
as
he
was
there
by
the
side
of
the
girl
that
a
new
vista
was
opening
before
his
eyes
it
was
not
that
he
understood
as
yet
or
scarcely
so
in
a
few
minutes
all
had
passed
them
and
he
rose
and
turned
to
see
the
end
he
watched
while
amid
the
splendour
of
that
court
with
singers
and
ministers
and
thurifers
arranged
before
the
priest
ascended
to
enthrone
the
sacrament
in
the
place
prepared
for
it
with
banks
of
flowers
behind
and
the
glitter
of
electric
as
well
as
of
candle
light
the
jewelled
rays
of
the
monstrance
gleaming
and
the
organ
pealing
note
on
note
in
a
triumphant
ecstasy
the
old
bent
priest
placed
that
he
carried
there
and
sank
down
before
it
then
all
sound
of
singing
and
of
movement
died
away
and
from
that
kneeling
crowd
one
lone
thin
voice
but
all
unshaken
cried
to
heaven
of
the
need
of
men
it
was
a
short
prayer
and
he
could
not
understand
it
but
it
seemed
to
peter
to
voice
his
every
need
and
to
go
on
and
on
till
it
reached
the
throne
the
amen
beat
gently
about
him
and
he
sank
his
face
in
his
hands
but
only
for
a
second
the
next
he
was
lifted
to
his
feet
all
that
had
gone
before
was
as
nothing
to
this
volume
of
praise
that
shook
it
seemed
to
him
the
very
carven
roof
above
and
swept
the
ancient
walls
in
waves
of
sound
in
aeternum
sanctissimum
cried
men
on
earth
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
the
very
angels
of
god
but
outside
he
collected
his
thoughts
well
he
said
i
glad
been
but
i
sha
go
again
why
not
demanded
louise
it
was
most
beautiful
i
have
never
it
better
oh
yes
it
was
said
peter
the
music
and
singing
were
wonderful
but
forgive
me
if
i
hurt
you
but
i
ca
help
saying
it
i
see
now
what
our
people
mean
when
they
say
it
is
nothing
less
than
idolatry
idolatry
queried
louise
stumblingly
and
bewildered
but
what
do
you
mean
well
said
peter
the
sacrament
is
of
course
a
holy
thing
a
very
holy
thing
the
sign
and
symbol
of
christ
himself
but
in
that
church
sign
and
symbol
were
forgotten
the
sacrament
was
worshipped
as
if
it
were
very
god
oui
oui
protested
louise
vehemently
it
is
it
is
le
bon
jesu
it
is
he
who
is
there
he
passed
by
us
among
them
all
as
we
read
he
went
through
the
crowds
of
jerusalem
in
the
holy
gospel
and
there
was
not
one
he
did
not
see
either
she
added
with
a
little
break
in
her
voice
peter
all
but
stopped
in
the
road
it
was
absurd
that
so
simple
a
thing
should
have
seemed
to
him
new
but
it
is
so
with
us
all
we
know
in
a
way
but
we
do
not
understand
and
then
there
comes
the
moment
of
illumination
sometimes
jesus
himself
he
exclaimed
and
broke
off
abruptly
he
recalled
a
fragment
of
speech
not
a
dead
man
not
a
man
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
god
but
he
ca
be
found
langton
had
said
was
it
so
he
walked
on
in
silence
what
if
louise
with
her
pitiful
story
and
her
caged
earthy
life
had
after
all
found
what
the
other
had
missed
he
pulled
himself
together
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
one
day
louise
asked
him
abruptly
if
he
had
been
to
see
the
girl
in
the
house
which
he
had
visited
with
pennell
he
told
her
no
and
she
said
they
had
met
by
chance
in
the
town
well
go
you
immediately
then
or
you
will
not
see
her
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
is
she
ill
dying
ah
non
not
dying
but
she
is
ill
they
will
take
her
to
a
but
this
afternoon
she
will
be
in
bed
she
like
to
see
you
i
think
peter
left
her
and
made
for
the
house
on
his
way
he
thought
of
something
and
took
a
turning
which
led
to
the
of
flowers
there
at
a
stall
he
bought
a
big
bunch
of
roses
and
some
sprays
of
asparagus
fern
and
set
off
again
arriving
he
found
the
door
shut
it
was
a
dilemma
for
he
did
not
even
know
the
girl
name
but
he
knocked
a
woman
opened
the
door
and
stared
at
him
and
his
flowers
i
think
there
is
a
girl
sick
here
said
peter
may
i
see
her
the
woman
stared
still
harder
and
he
thought
she
was
going
to
refuse
him
admission
but
at
length
she
gave
way
entrez
she
said
je
pense
que
vous
savez
le
chambre
mais
le
bouquet
incroyable
peter
went
up
the
stairs
and
knocked
at
the
door
a
voice
asked
who
was
there
and
he
smiled
because
he
could
not
say
the
girl
did
not
know
his
name
either
a
friend
he
said
may
i
come
in
a
note
of
curiosity
sounded
in
her
voice
oui
certainement
entrez
she
called
peter
turned
the
handle
and
entered
the
remembered
room
the
girl
was
sitting
up
in
bed
in
her
nightdress
her
hair
in
disorder
and
the
room
felt
hot
and
stuffy
and
looked
more
tawdry
than
ever
she
exclaimed
at
the
sight
of
his
flowers
he
deposited
the
big
bunch
by
the
side
of
her
and
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
she
had
been
reading
a
book
and
he
noticed
it
was
the
sort
of
book
that
langton
and
he
had
seen
so
prominently
in
the
at
abbeville
if
he
had
expected
to
find
her
depressed
or
ashamed
he
was
entirely
mistaken
oh
you
darling
she
cried
in
clipped
english
kiss
me
quick
or
i
will
forget
the
orders
of
the
doctor
and
jump
out
of
bed
and
catch
you
oh
that
you
should
bring
me
the
rose
so
beautiful
hélas
i
may
not
wear
one
this
night
in
the
café
see
are
they
not
beautiful
here
she
pulled
her
nightdress
open
considerably
more
than
the
average
evening
dress
is
cut
away
and
put
two
or
three
of
the
blooms
on
her
white
bosom
putting
her
head
on
one
side
to
see
the
result
oui
she
exclaimed
je
suis
exquise
i
so
many
boys
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
but
i
forget
i
can
not
go
je
suis
malade
très
malade
you
knew
you
are
angry
with
me
is
it
not
so
he
laughed
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
no
he
said
why
should
i
be
but
i
am
very
sorry
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
is
nothing
she
said
la
guerre
for
me
i
shall
not
be
long
and
when
i
come
out
you
will
come
to
see
me
again
will
you
not
and
bring
me
more
flowers
and
you
shall
not
let
me
the
danger
any
more
and
if
i
do
wrong
you
shall
smack
me
you
will
like
that
in
the
books
men
like
it
much
would
you
like
to
whip
me
she
demanded
her
eyes
sparkling
as
she
threw
herself
over
in
the
bed
and
looked
up
at
him
peter
got
up
and
moved
away
to
the
window
no
he
said
shortly
staring
out
he
had
a
sensation
of
physical
nausea
and
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
restrain
himself
he
realised
suddenly
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
final
handiwork
only
his
new
knowledge
kept
him
quiet
even
she
might
be
little
to
blame
he
remembered
all
that
she
had
said
to
him
before
and
suddenly
his
disgust
was
turned
into
overwhelming
pity
this
child
before
him
for
she
was
little
more
than
a
child
had
bottomed
degradation
for
the
temporary
protection
and
favour
of
a
man
that
she
guessed
to
be
kind
there
was
nothing
in
earth
or
in
hell
that
she
would
not
do
and
in
her
already
were
the
seeds
of
the
disease
that
was
all
but
certain
to
slay
her
he
turned
again
to
the
bed
and
knelt
beside
it
poor
little
girl
he
said
and
lightly
brushed
her
hair
he
certainly
never
expected
the
result
she
pushed
him
from
her
oh
go
go
she
cried
quick
go
you
pretend
but
you
do
not
love
me
why
you
give
me
money
the
flowers
if
you
do
not
want
me
go
quick
come
never
to
see
me
again
peter
did
the
only
thing
he
could
do
he
went
he
said
cheerfully
at
the
door
i
hope
you
will
be
better
soon
i
did
mean
to
be
a
beast
to
you
give
the
flowers
to
lucienne
if
you
do
want
them
she
will
be
able
to
wear
them
cheerio
she
echoed
after
him
and
he
closed
the
door
on
her
life
in
front
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
he
met
arnold
returning
from
the
club
and
the
two
men
walked
off
together
in
a
moment
of
impulse
he
related
the
whole
story
to
him
now
he
said
what
do
you
make
of
all
that
arnold
was
very
moved
it
was
not
his
way
to
say
much
but
he
walked
on
silently
for
a
long
time
then
he
said
the
potter
makes
many
vessels
but
never
one
needlessly
i
hold
on
to
that
and
he
can
remake
the
broken
clay
are
you
sure
asked
peter
i
am
said
arnold
it
not
in
the
westminster
confession
nor
in
the
book
of
common
prayer
nor
for
all
i
know
in
the
penny
catechism
but
i
believe
it
god
almighty
must
be
stronger
than
the
devil
graham
peter
considered
this
then
he
shook
his
head
that
wo
wash
arnold
he
said
if
god
is
stronger
than
the
devil
so
that
the
devil
is
never
ultimately
going
to
succeed
i
can
see
no
use
in
letting
him
have
his
fling
at
all
and
i
more
respect
for
the
devil
than
to
think
he
take
it
it
childish
to
suppose
the
existence
of
two
such
forces
at
a
perpetual
game
of
cheat
either
there
is
no
devil
and
there
is
no
hell
in
which
case
i
reckon
that
there
is
no
heaven
either
for
a
heaven
would
not
be
a
heaven
if
it
were
not
attained
and
there
would
be
no
true
attainment
if
there
were
no
possibility
of
failure
or
else
there
are
all
three
and
if
there
are
all
three
the
devil
wins
out
sometimes
in
the
end
then
god
is
not
almighty
peter
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
i
breed
white
mice
i
do
lessen
my
potential
power
if
i
choose
to
let
some
loose
in
the
garden
to
see
if
the
cat
will
get
them
besides
in
the
end
i
could
annihilate
the
cat
if
i
wanted
to
you
ca
think
of
god
so
cried
arnold
sharply
ca
i
demanded
peter
well
maybe
not
arnold
i
do
know
that
i
can
think
of
him
at
all
but
i
can
face
the
facts
of
life
and
if
i
not
a
coward
i
sha
run
away
from
them
that
what
i
been
doing
these
days
and
that
what
i
do
not
think
even
a
man
like
yourself
does
fairly
you
think
i
take
it
that
a
girl
like
that
is
damned
utterly
by
all
the
canons
of
theology
and
then
forced
on
by
pity
and
tenderness
you
cry
out
against
them
all
that
she
is
god
making
and
he
will
not
throw
her
away
is
that
it
arnold
slightly
evaded
an
answer
how
can
you
save
her
graham
he
asked
i
ca
i
do
pretend
i
can
i
nothing
to
say
or
do
i
see
only
one
flicker
of
hope
and
that
lies
in
the
fact
that
she
understand
what
love
is
no
shadow
of
the
truth
has
ever
come
her
way
if
now
by
any
chance
she
could
see
for
one
instant
in
mind
you
the
face
of
god
if
god
is
love
he
added
they
walked
a
dozen
paces
and
even
then
she
might
refuse
he
said
whose
fault
would
that
be
demanded
the
older
man
peter
answered
quickly
whose
fault
why
all
our
faults
yours
and
mine
and
the
fault
of
men
like
pennell
and
donovan
as
well
as
her
own
too
as
like
as
not
we
all
helped
build
up
the
scheme
of
things
as
they
are
and
we
are
all
responsible
we
curse
the
germans
for
making
this
damned
war
and
it
is
the
war
that
has
done
most
to
make
that
girl
but
they
did
make
it
no
kaiser
made
it
and
no
nietzsche
the
only
person
who
had
no
hand
in
it
that
i
know
of
was
jesus
christ
and
those
who
have
left
all
and
followed
him
said
arnold
softly
precious
few
retorted
peter
the
other
had
nothing
to
say
during
these
months
peter
wrote
often
to
hilda
and
with
increasing
frankness
her
replies
grew
shorter
as
his
letters
grew
longer
it
was
strange
perhaps
that
he
should
continue
to
write
but
the
explanation
was
not
far
to
seek
it
was
by
her
that
he
gauged
the
extent
of
his
separation
from
the
old
outlook
and
in
her
that
he
still
clung
desperately
as
it
were
to
the
past
against
reason
he
elevated
her
into
a
kind
of
test
position
and
if
her
replies
gave
him
no
encouragement
they
at
least
served
to
make
him
feel
the
inevitableness
and
the
reality
of
his
present
position
it
would
have
been
easy
to
get
into
the
swim
and
let
it
carry
him
carelessly
on
moderately
easy
at
any
rate
but
with
hilda
to
refer
to
he
was
forced
to
take
notice
and
it
was
she
therefore
that
hastened
the
end
just
after
christmas
in
a
fit
of
temporary
boldness
he
told
her
about
louise
so
that
it
was
louise
again
who
was
the
responsible
person
during
these
months
hilda
reply
was
delayed
nor
had
she
written
immediately
when
he
got
it
it
was
brief
but
to
the
point
she
did
not
doubt
she
said
but
that
what
he
had
written
was
strictly
true
and
she
did
not
doubt
his
honour
but
he
must
see
that
their
relationship
was
impossible
she
could
marry
the
man
who
appeared
actually
to
like
the
company
of
such
a
woman
nor
could
she
do
other
than
feel
that
the
end
would
seem
to
him
as
plain
as
it
did
to
her
and
that
he
would
leave
the
church
or
at
any
rate
such
a
ministry
in
it
as
she
could
share
she
had
told
her
people
that
she
was
no
longer
engaged
in
order
that
he
should
feel
free
but
she
would
ever
remember
the
man
as
she
had
known
him
whom
she
had
loved
and
whom
she
loved
still
it
was
in
the
afternoon
that
peter
got
the
letter
and
he
was
just
setting
off
for
the
hospital
when
he
had
read
it
he
put
on
his
cap
and
set
off
in
the
opposite
direction
there
was
a
walk
along
the
a
few
feet
wide
where
the
wind
blew
strongly
laden
with
the
channel
breezes
and
on
the
other
side
was
a
waste
of
sand
and
stone
in
some
places
water
was
on
both
sides
of
the
wall
and
here
one
could
feel
more
alone
than
anywhere
else
in
the
town
peter
set
off
his
head
in
a
mad
whirl
he
had
felt
that
such
a
letter
would
come
for
weeks
but
that
did
not
in
a
way
lessen
the
blow
when
it
came
he
had
known
too
that
hilda
was
not
to
him
what
she
had
been
but
he
had
not
altogether
felt
that
she
never
could
be
so
again
now
he
knew
that
he
had
gone
too
far
to
turn
back
he
felt
he
could
not
help
it
released
in
a
sense
with
almost
a
sense
of
exhilaration
behind
it
for
the
unknown
lay
before
and
yet
since
we
are
all
so
human
he
was
intensely
unhappy
below
all
this
he
called
to
mind
little
scenes
and
bits
of
scenes
their
first
meeting
the
sight
of
her
in
church
as
he
preached
how
she
had
looked
at
the
in
park
lane
her
walk
as
she
came
to
meet
him
in
the
park
and
he
knew
well
enough
how
he
had
hurt
her
and
the
thought
maddened
him
he
told
himself
that
god
was
a
devil
to
treat
him
so
that
he
had
tried
to
follow
the
right
and
that
the
way
had
led
him
down
towards
nothing
but
despair
he
was
no
nearer
answering
the
problems
that
beset
him
he
might
have
been
in
a
paradise
before
but
what
was
the
use
of
coming
out
to
see
the
devil
as
he
was
and
men
and
women
as
they
were
if
he
could
see
no
more
than
that
the
throne
of
his
heart
was
empty
and
there
was
none
to
fill
it
julie
chapter
v
the
ended
not
far
from
donovan
camp
of
mud
and
cinders
and
having
got
there
peter
thought
he
would
go
on
and
get
a
cup
of
tea
he
crossed
the
steered
through
a
great
american
rest
camp
crossed
the
canal
and
entered
the
camp
it
was
a
cheerless
place
in
winter
and
the
day
was
drawing
in
early
with
a
damp
fog
a
great
french
airship
was
cruising
around
overhead
and
dropping
down
towards
her
in
the
great
hangar
near
by
she
looked
cold
and
ghostly
up
aloft
the
more
so
when
her
engines
were
shut
off
and
peter
thought
how
chilly
her
crew
must
be
he
had
a
hankering
after
donovan
cheery
humour
especially
as
he
had
not
seen
him
for
some
time
he
crossed
the
camp
and
made
for
the
it
was
lit
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
at
the
door
he
stopped
dead
at
the
sound
of
laughter
then
he
walked
quickly
in
caught
out
by
jove
said
donovan
voice
you
for
it
julie
a
merry
party
sat
round
the
stove
taking
tea
julie
and
miss
raynard
were
both
there
with
pennell
and
another
man
from
donovan
camp
julie
wore
furs
and
had
plainly
just
come
in
for
her
cheeks
were
glowing
with
exercise
pennell
was
sitting
next
miss
raynard
but
donovan
on
a
wooden
just
beyond
where
julie
sat
in
a
big
cushioned
chair
looked
out
at
him
from
almost
under
julie
arm
as
he
bent
forward
the
other
man
was
standing
by
the
table
teapot
in
hand
one
thinks
quickly
at
such
a
time
and
peter
mind
raced
something
of
the
old
envy
and
almost
fear
of
donovan
that
he
had
had
first
that
day
in
the
hospital
came
back
to
him
he
had
not
seen
the
two
together
for
so
long
that
it
struck
him
like
a
blow
to
hear
donovan
call
her
by
her
christian
name
it
flashed
across
his
mind
also
that
she
knew
that
it
was
his
day
at
the
hospital
and
that
she
had
deliberately
gone
out
but
it
dawned
on
him
equally
quickly
that
he
must
hide
all
that
i
should
jolly
well
think
so
he
said
laughing
how
do
you
do
miss
raynard
donovan
can
you
give
me
some
tea
i
come
along
the
and
picked
up
a
regular
appetite
are
you
in
the
habit
of
taking
tea
here
julie
i
thought
nurses
were
not
allowed
in
camps
she
looked
at
him
quickly
but
he
missed
the
meaning
of
her
glance
rather
she
said
i
come
here
for
tea
about
once
a
week
do
i
jack
no
nurses
are
not
allowed
in
camps
but
i
always
do
what
not
allowed
as
far
as
possible
and
this
is
so
snug
and
out
of
the
way
pennell
you
can
give
me
a
cigarette
now
the
other
man
offered
peter
tea
which
he
took
and
how
did
the
festivities
go
off
at
christmas
he
asked
oh
topping
said
julie
let
me
see
you
were
at
the
play
so
i
need
talk
about
that
but
you
thought
it
good
did
you
rippin
said
peter
well
said
julie
then
there
was
the
dance
on
boxing
night
we
had
glorious
fun
jack
here
behaved
perfectly
abominably
he
sat
out
about
half
the
dances
and
i
should
think
he
kissed
every
pretty
girl
in
the
room
then
we
went
down
to
the
nurses
quarters
of
the
officers
hospital
and
made
cocoa
of
all
things
and
had
a
few
more
dances
on
our
own
they
made
me
dance
a
skirt
dance
on
the
table
and
as
i
had
enough
laces
on
this
time
i
did
after
that
but
i
do
think
i
tell
you
what
we
did
after
that
why
did
you
come
peter
had
been
at
a
big
boxing
night
entertainment
for
the
troops
in
the
central
hall
but
he
did
not
say
so
oh
he
said
i
had
to
go
to
another
stunt
but
i
must
say
i
wish
i
been
at
yours
may
i
have
another
cup
of
tea
the
third
man
gave
it
to
him
again
and
then
apologizing
left
the
room
donovan
exchanged
glances
with
julie
and
she
nodded
i
say
graham
said
donovan
i
tell
you
what
we
really
met
here
for
we
were
going
to
fix
it
up
and
then
ask
you
but
as
dropped
in
we
take
it
as
a
dispensation
of
providence
and
let
you
into
the
know
what
do
you
say
to
a
really
sporting
dinner
at
the
new
year
who
to
be
asked
queried
peter
looking
round
fives
into
a
dinner
wo
go
i
should
think
not
cried
julie
gaily
jack
here
is
taking
me
are
you
donovan
said
i
am
with
great
emphasis
and
made
as
if
he
would
kiss
her
and
she
pushed
him
off
laughing
holding
her
muff
to
his
face
then
she
went
on
you
to
take
tommy
it
is
tommy
own
particular
desire
and
you
ought
to
feel
flattered
she
says
your
auras
blend
whatever
that
may
be
and
as
to
pennell
he
got
a
girl
elsewhere
whom
he
will
ask
three
and
three
make
six
what
do
you
think
of
that
julie
said
tommy
raynard
composedly
you
the
most
fearful
liar
i
ever
met
but
i
trust
captain
graham
knows
you
well
enough
by
now
i
do
said
peter
but
a
trifle
grimly
though
he
tried
not
to
show
it
i
do
i
must
say
i
jolly
glad
donovan
will
be
responsible
for
you
it
going
to
be
evening
i
can
see
and
what
you
do
if
you
get
excited
i
do
know
flirt
with
the
proprietor
and
have
his
wife
down
on
us
as
like
as
not
in
which
event
it
donovan
who
have
to
make
the
explanations
but
come
on
what
are
the
details
tell
him
jack
said
julie
he
a
perfect
beast
and
i
sha
speak
to
him
again
peter
laughed
pas
possible
he
said
but
come
on
donovan
do
as
you
told
well
old
bird
said
donovan
first
we
meet
here
got
that
it
safer
than
any
other
camp
and
we
do
want
to
meet
in
town
we
have
tea
and
a
chat
and
then
clear
off
we
order
dinner
in
a
private
room
at
the
grand
and
it
be
a
dinner
fit
for
the
occasion
they
got
some
priceless
sherry
there
and
some
old
white
port
cognac
fine
champagne
for
the
liqueur
and
what
date
do
you
think
as
i
alive
i
saw
some
the
other
day
and
spoke
about
it
that
gave
me
the
idea
of
the
dinner
really
and
i
put
it
to
the
old
horse
that
that
brandy
was
worthy
of
a
dinner
to
introduce
it
he
tumbled
at
once
veuve
cliquot
as
the
main
wine
what
about
it
peter
balanced
himself
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
blew
out
what
time
are
you
ordering
the
ambulances
he
demanded
the
beds
you
mean
cried
julie
entirely
forgetting
her
last
words
that
what
i
say
shall
never
be
able
to
walk
to
a
taxi
even
i
carry
you
said
donovan
you
wo
be
able
not
after
such
a
night
besides
i
do
believe
you
could
anyhow
you
getting
flabby
from
lack
of
exercise
am
i
cried
donovan
let
see
anyway
he
darted
at
her
slipped
an
arm
under
her
skirts
and
another
under
her
arms
and
lifted
her
bodily
from
the
chair
jack
she
shrieked
put
me
down
oh
you
beast
tommy
help
help
peter
make
him
put
me
down
and
i
forgive
you
all
you
said
tommy
raynard
sprang
up
laughing
and
ran
after
donovan
who
could
not
escape
her
she
threw
an
arm
round
his
neck
and
bent
his
head
backwards
i
shall
drop
her
he
shouted
peter
leaped
forward
and
julie
landed
in
his
arms
for
a
second
she
lay
still
and
peter
stared
down
at
her
with
her
quick
intuition
she
read
something
new
in
his
eyes
and
instantly
looked
away
scrambling
out
and
standing
there
flushed
and
breathing
hard
her
hands
at
her
hair
you
perfect
brute
she
said
to
donovan
laughing
pay
you
out
see
if
i
do
all
my
hair
coming
down
capital
said
donovan
i
never
seen
it
down
and
i
love
to
here
let
me
help
he
darted
at
her
she
dodged
behind
peter
he
adroitly
put
out
a
foot
and
donovan
collapsed
into
the
big
chair
julie
clapped
her
hands
and
rushed
at
him
seizing
a
cushion
and
the
two
struggled
there
till
tommy
raynard
pulled
julie
forcibly
away
julie
she
said
this
is
a
positive
you
must
behave
and
i
said
pennell
who
had
not
moved
would
like
to
know
a
little
more
about
the
dinner
he
spoke
so
dryly
that
they
all
laughed
and
order
was
restored
donovan
however
refused
to
get
out
of
the
big
chair
and
julie
deliberately
sat
on
his
knee
smiling
provocatively
at
him
peter
felt
savage
and
bitter
like
a
man
he
was
easily
deceived
and
he
had
been
taken
by
surprise
at
a
bad
moment
but
he
did
his
best
to
hide
it
and
merely
threw
any
remnants
of
caution
he
had
left
at
all
to
the
winds
i
suppose
this
is
the
best
we
can
hope
for
captain
graham
said
miss
raynard
placidly
perhaps
now
you
give
us
your
views
captain
donovan
never
gets
beyond
the
drinks
but
i
agree
with
pennell
we
want
something
substantial
i
blest
if
i
do
think
you
all
confoundedly
ungrateful
said
donovan
i
worked
that
fine
champagne
for
you
beautifully
anyone
would
think
you
could
walk
in
and
order
it
any
day
if
we
get
it
at
all
be
due
to
me
and
my
blarney
not
but
what
it
does
deserve
a
good
introduction
he
added
i
do
suppose
there
another
bottle
in
the
town
tommy
sighed
he
off
again
or
he
will
be
she
said
do
be
quick
captain
graham
well
said
peter
i
suggest
first
that
you
leave
the
ordering
of
the
room
to
me
and
the
decorations
i
most
time
and
i
like
to
choose
the
flowers
and
the
smokes
and
crackers
and
i
worry
round
and
get
some
and
have
printed
in
style
and
if
you
like
interview
the
chef
and
see
what
he
can
give
us
it
not
much
use
our
discussing
details
without
him
daniel
come
to
judgment
said
pennell
padre
i
did
know
you
had
it
in
you
a
solomon
said
julie
mischievously
a
peter
graham
said
miss
raynard
i
always
knew
he
had
more
sense
in
his
little
finger
than
all
the
rest
of
you
in
your
heads
donovan
sighed
from
the
depths
of
the
chair
graham
he
said
for
heaven
sake
remember
those
julie
clapped
her
hand
over
his
mouth
he
kissed
it
she
withdrew
it
with
a
scream
drinks
finished
donovan
the
chef
must
suggest
accordin
well
said
pennell
i
reckon
that
settled
satisfactorily
i
get
out
my
invitation
in
fact
i
think
if
i
may
be
excused
i
go
and
do
it
now
he
got
up
and
reached
for
his
cap
they
all
laughed
we
see
to
it
that
there
mistletoe
cried
julie
ah
thanks
said
pennell
that
will
be
jolly
though
some
people
i
know
seem
to
get
on
well
enough
without
it
so
long
see
you
later
padre
he
avoided
julie
flung
cushion
and
stepped
through
the
door
miss
raynard
got
up
we
ought
to
get
a
move
on
too
my
dear
she
said
to
julie
oh
not
yet
protested
donovan
let
have
some
bridge
there
are
just
four
of
us
you
can
never
have
played
bridge
with
julie
captain
donovan
said
miss
raynard
she
usually
flings
the
cards
at
you
half
way
through
the
rubber
and
she
never
counts
the
other
night
she
played
a
diamond
instead
of
a
heart
when
hearts
were
trumps
and
she
had
the
last
and
all
the
rest
of
the
tricks
in
her
hand
ah
well
said
donovan
women
are
like
that
they
often
mistake
diamonds
for
hearts
jack
said
julie
you
really
clever
how
do
you
do
it
i
had
no
idea
does
it
hurt
but
do
do
it
again
you
might
break
something
peter
you
been
praised
this
evening
but
you
never
think
of
that
he
would
not
said
miss
raynard
come
on
julie
peter
hesitated
a
second
then
he
said
you
going
my
way
may
i
see
you
home
thanks
said
miss
raynard
and
they
all
made
a
move
it
deuced
dark
said
donovan
here
let
me
i
go
first
with
a
candle
so
that
you
sha
miss
the
he
passed
out
tommy
raynard
after
him
peter
stood
back
to
let
julie
pass
and
as
she
did
so
she
said
you
very
glum
and
very
polite
solomon
what
the
matter
am
i
said
peter
i
did
know
it
and
in
any
case
donovan
is
all
right
is
he
he
could
have
bitten
his
tongue
out
the
next
minute
she
looked
at
him
and
then
began
to
laugh
silently
and
still
laughing
went
out
before
him
peter
followed
miserably
at
the
gate
donovan
said
and
the
three
set
out
for
the
hospital
miss
raynard
walked
between
peter
and
julie
and
did
most
of
the
talking
but
the
ground
was
rough
and
the
path
narrow
and
it
was
not
until
they
got
on
to
the
dock
road
that
much
could
be
said
this
is
the
best
christmas
i
ever
had
declared
miss
raynard
feeling
positively
done
up
there
was
something
on
every
afternoon
and
evening
last
week
and
then
julie
sits
on
my
bed
till
daybreak
more
or
less
and
smokes
cigarettes
we
a
bottle
of
benedictine
too
and
it
always
goes
to
her
head
the
other
night
she
did
a
salome
dance
on
the
strength
of
it
it
was
really
fine
said
julie
you
ought
to
have
seen
me
till
the
towel
slipped
off
not
then
i
hope
said
tommy
dryly
i
do
suppose
he
have
minded
would
you
peter
not
a
bit
said
peter
cheerfully
on
the
contrary
i
do
know
if
you
two
are
aware
that
you
are
positively
indecent
said
tommy
let
change
the
subject
what
your
news
captain
graham
peter
smiled
in
the
dark
to
himself
well
he
said
not
much
but
hoping
for
leave
soon
i
pushed
in
for
it
and
our
adjutant
told
me
this
morning
he
thought
it
would
go
through
lucky
man
i
got
to
wait
three
months
but
yours
ought
to
be
about
now
julie
i
think
it
ought
said
julie
shortly
then
what
about
the
peter
would
you
like
me
to
help
you
choose
them
would
you
said
he
eagerly
i
on
duty
at
five
but
i
can
get
off
for
an
hour
in
the
afternoon
could
you
come
tommy
no
sorry
but
i
must
write
letters
i
have
written
one
for
ages
nor
have
i
said
julie
but
i
do
mean
to
i
hate
letters
well
what
about
it
peter
i
should
think
we
had
better
try
that
stationer
in
the
rue
thiers
he
said
if
that
wo
do
the
nouvelles
galeries
might
what
do
you
think
let
try
the
galeries
first
we
could
meet
there
say
at
three
eh
i
want
to
get
some
too
tommy
sighed
audibly
she
off
again
she
said
thank
god
here
the
hospital
captain
graham
you
cross
the
rubicon
you
ought
to
swear
before
him
said
julie
in
mock
severity
and
what
in
the
world
is
the
rubicon
materially
it
the
between
his
camp
and
the
hospital
said
tommy
raynard
what
else
it
is
i
leave
him
to
decide
she
held
out
her
hand
and
peter
saw
a
quizzical
look
on
her
face
he
turned
rather
hopelessly
to
julie
i
say
he
said
did
you
it
was
my
afternoon
at
the
hospital
yes
said
julie
and
i
knew
you
did
come
at
least
i
could
see
you
in
any
of
the
wards
oh
he
exclaimed
i
thought
you
been
out
all
the
afternoon
sorry
i
am
a
damned
fool
julie
she
laughed
in
the
darkness
i
known
worse
peter
she
said
and
was
gone
next
day
julie
was
in
her
most
provocative
of
moods
peter
eminently
respectable
in
his
best
tunic
waited
ten
minutes
for
her
outside
the
nouvelles
galeries
and
like
most
men
in
his
condition
considered
that
she
was
never
coming
and
that
he
was
the
cynosure
of
neighbouring
eyes
when
she
did
come
she
was
not
apparently
aware
that
she
was
late
she
ran
her
eyes
over
him
and
gave
a
pretended
gasp
of
surprise
looking
wonderful
padre
graham
she
said
really
you
hard
to
live
up
to
i
never
know
what
to
expect
or
how
to
behave
those
black
buttons
terrorise
me
come
on
she
insisted
on
getting
her
ribbon
first
and
turned
over
everything
there
was
to
be
seen
at
that
counter
the
french
girl
who
served
them
was
highly
amused
is
that
chic
julie
demanded
of
peter
holding
up
a
lacy
camisole
and
deliberately
putting
it
to
her
shoulders
would
you
love
to
see
me
in
it
i
would
he
said
without
the
ghost
of
a
smile
well
you
never
will
of
course
she
said
i
shall
never
marry
or
be
given
in
marriage
and
in
any
case
in
that
uniform
you
nothing
whatever
to
hope
for
yes
i
take
that
ribbon
thank
you
peter
i
suppose
you
ca
carry
it
for
me
your
pocket
not
a
bad
idea
but
let
me
put
it
in
peter
stood
while
she
undid
his
and
stuffed
it
inside
anything
more
demanded
the
french
saleswoman
interrogatively
not
merci
said
julie
you
see
peter
you
could
carry
undies
for
me
even
in
your
pocket
it
would
be
respectable
come
on
you
will
keep
us
here
the
entire
day
they
passed
the
smoking
department
and
she
stopped
suddenly
peter
she
said
i
going
to
give
you
a
pipe
those
chocolates
you
gave
me
at
christmas
were
too
delicious
for
anything
what
sort
do
you
like
a
briar
let
me
see
if
it
blows
nicely
she
put
it
to
her
lips
i
swear
i
shall
start
a
pipe
soon
in
my
old
age
by
the
way
i
do
believe
you
have
any
idea
how
old
i
am
have
you
peter
guess
she
was
quick
to
note
the
return
to
his
old
manner
he
was
nervous
with
her
not
sure
of
himself
and
so
not
sure
of
her
either
and
she
traded
on
it
at
the
stationery
department
she
made
eyes
at
a
couple
of
officers
and
insisted
on
examining
kirschner
some
of
which
she
would
not
show
him
you
ca
possibly
be
seen
looking
at
them
with
those
badges
up
she
whispered
dear
me
if
only
donovan
were
here
he
would
mind
and
i
do
know
which
packet
i
like
best
these
have
got
very
little
on
peter
little
but
i
not
sure
that
they
are
not
more
decent
than
those
it
worse
than
a
camisole
you
know
peter
was
horribly
conscious
that
the
men
were
smiling
at
her
julie
he
said
desperately
be
sensible
just
for
a
minute
we
must
get
those
well
you
go
and
find
the
books
she
said
merrily
i
told
you
you
ought
not
to
watch
me
buy
these
i
take
the
best
care
of
myself
and
she
looked
past
him
towards
the
men
peter
gave
it
up
julie
he
said
savagely
if
you
make
eyes
any
more
i
kiss
you
here
and
now
i
swear
i
will
julie
laughed
her
little
nearly
silent
chuckle
and
looked
at
him
i
believe
you
would
peter
she
said
and
i
certainly
must
risk
that
i
be
good
are
those
the
books
fetch
me
a
chair
then
and
i
look
through
them
he
bent
over
her
as
she
turned
the
leaves
she
wore
a
little
toque
that
had
some
relation
to
a
nurse
uniform
but
was
distinctive
of
julie
her
fringe
of
brown
hair
lay
along
her
forehead
and
the
thick
masses
of
the
rest
of
it
tempted
him
almost
beyond
endurance
how
will
that
do
she
demanded
her
eyes
dancing
oh
do
look
at
the
cards
and
not
at
me
you
a
terrible
person
to
bring
shopping
peter
the
card
selected
she
had
a
bright
idea
what
about
she
queried
we
ca
trust
the
hotel
i
want
some
with
violets
on
them
i
love
violets
do
you
he
said
eagerly
that
just
what
i
wanted
to
know
yes
a
fine
idea
let
go
and
get
them
outside
she
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
looked
at
the
little
gold
on
her
arm
we
time
she
said
take
me
to
tea
you
must
know
it
not
possible
he
said
they
enforcing
the
order
and
one
ca
get
tea
anywhere
she
shook
her
head
at
him
i
think
peter
she
said
you
never
learn
the
ropes
follow
me
not
literally
but
metaphorically
he
followed
her
she
led
him
to
a
big
confectioner
with
two
doors
and
several
windows
in
each
of
which
was
a
big
notice
of
the
new
law
forbidding
teas
or
the
purchase
of
chocolates
inside
she
walked
up
to
a
girl
who
was
standing
by
a
counter
and
who
greeted
her
with
a
smile
it
is
cold
outside
she
said
may
i
have
a
warm
by
the
fire
certainly
mademoiselle
said
the
girl
and
monsieur
also
will
it
please
you
to
come
round
here
they
went
behind
the
counter
and
in
at
a
little
door
there
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
of
the
small
kitchen
and
a
kettle
singing
on
the
hob
julie
sat
down
on
a
chair
at
the
wooden
table
and
looked
round
with
satisfaction
why
it
all
ready
for
us
she
exclaimed
chocolate
cakes
suzanne
please
hot
buttered
scones
i
butter
them
if
you
bring
the
scones
they
came
and
she
went
to
the
fire
splitting
them
open
and
spreading
the
butter
lavishly
i
love
france
she
said
all
laws
are
made
to
be
broken
which
is
all
that
laws
are
good
for
do
you
think
yes
he
said
deliberately
glancing
at
the
closed
door
and
bent
and
kissed
her
neck
she
looked
up
imperiously
again
she
said
and
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
at
that
she
jumped
up
with
a
quick
return
to
the
old
manner
peter
for
a
parson
you
are
the
outside
edge
go
and
sit
down
over
there
and
recollect
yourself
to
begin
with
if
we
found
here
there
be
a
row
and
if
you
caught
kissing
me
who
knows
what
will
happen
he
obeyed
gaily
chaff
away
julie
he
said
but
i
sha
wear
black
buttons
at
the
dinner
you
have
to
look
out
that
night
she
put
the
scones
on
the
table
and
sat
down
and
if
i
do
she
queried
peter
said
nothing
he
had
suddenly
thought
of
something
he
looked
at
her
and
for
the
first
time
she
would
not
meet
his
eyes
it
was
thought
better
on
new
year
eve
that
they
should
go
separately
to
donovan
camp
so
peter
and
pennell
set
out
for
it
alone
by
the
canal
pennell
left
his
friend
to
go
and
meet
elsie
harding
the
third
girl
peter
went
on
alone
and
found
donovan
giving
some
orders
in
the
camp
he
stood
with
him
till
they
saw
the
other
four
who
had
met
on
the
coming
in
together
he
a
dark
horse
called
julie
almost
before
they
had
come
up
and
so
she
fancy
elsie
being
the
third
i
did
know
they
knew
each
other
we
a
colonial
party
jack
all
except
peter
that
is
for
pennell
is
more
canadian
than
english
we
teach
them
by
the
way
i
ca
go
on
saying
pennell
all
night
what
shall
i
call
him
elsie
peter
saw
that
the
wore
an
australian
brooch
and
caught
the
unmistakable
but
charming
accent
in
her
reply
he
to
me
and
he
can
be
to
you
if
you
like
julie
she
said
tommy
sighed
audibly
they
beginning
early
she
said
but
i
suppose
the
rest
of
us
had
better
follow
the
general
example
eh
peter
in
the
anteroom
where
tea
was
ready
peter
saw
that
elsie
was
likely
to
play
julie
a
good
second
she
was
tall
taller
than
pennell
himself
and
dark
skinned
with
black
hair
and
full
red
lips
and
rather
bigly
built
it
appeared
that
her
great
gift
was
a
set
of
double
joints
that
allowed
her
to
play
the
contortionist
with
great
effect
you
should
just
see
her
in
tights
said
julie
trevor
why
did
you
say
whom
you
were
bringing
and
i
have
made
her
put
them
on
then
we
could
have
had
an
exhibition
but
as
it
is
i
suppose
we
ca
i
did
know
you
knew
her
he
said
you
never
have
time
to
talk
of
other
people
when
you
together
i
suppose
she
retorted
well
i
no
doubt
you
make
the
most
of
your
opportunities
and
you
very
wise
but
you
got
to
behave
more
or
less
at
least
till
after
the
coffee
otherwise
all
our
preparations
will
be
wasted
wo
they
peter
after
tea
they
set
off
together
for
the
that
ran
into
town
it
was
julie
who
had
decided
this
she
said
she
liked
to
see
the
people
and
the
cars
were
so
perfectly
absurd
which
was
true
also
that
it
would
be
too
early
to
enjoy
taxis
the
which
was
very
like
her
so
they
walked
in
a
body
to
the
terminus
where
a
crowd
of
tommies
and
french
workmen
and
factory
girls
were
waiting
the
night
was
cloudy
and
a
little
damp
but
it
had
the
effect
of
adding
mystery
to
the
otherwise
ugly
street
and
to
the
great
ships
under
repair
in
the
dockyards
close
by
the
lights
of
the
tram
appeared
at
length
round
the
corner
an
and
two
trailers
there
was
a
bolt
for
them
they
were
packed
on
the
steps
and
the
men
had
to
use
elbows
freely
to
get
the
whole
party
in
but
the
soldiers
and
the
workmen
were
in
excellent
humour
and
the
french
girls
openly
admiring
of
julie
in
the
result
then
they
were
all
hunched
up
in
the
end
of
a
first
compartment
and
peter
found
himself
with
his
back
to
the
glass
door
julie
on
his
right
elsie
on
his
left
every
rib
i
have
is
broken
said
the
former
the
natural
or
the
artificial
demanded
elsie
personally
i
think
i
broke
a
few
of
other
people
they
started
and
the
rattling
of
the
ramshackle
cars
stopped
conversation
julie
drew
peter
attention
to
a
little
scene
on
the
platform
outside
and
he
looked
through
the
glass
to
see
a
big
french
linesman
with
his
girl
the
man
had
got
her
into
a
corner
and
then
coolly
putting
his
arms
out
on
either
side
to
the
and
to
the
knob
of
their
door
he
was
facing
his
amorata
indifferent
to
the
world
peter
looked
at
the
girl
coarse
face
she
was
a
factory
hand
bareheaded
and
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
at
her
elbows
for
all
that
she
was
neat
as
a
frenchwoman
invariably
is
the
girl
caught
his
gaze
and
smiled
the
linesman
followed
the
direction
of
her
eyes
and
glanced
friendly
at
peter
too
then
he
saw
julie
a
look
of
admiration
came
over
his
face
and
he
put
one
hand
comically
to
his
heart
the
girl
slapped
it
in
a
pretended
fury
and
julie
doubled
up
with
laughter
in
her
corner
peter
bent
over
her
doing
it
doing
it
doing
it
he
quoted
merrily
the
tram
stopped
in
the
square
before
the
hôtel
de
ville
there
was
a
great
air
of
festivity
and
bustle
about
as
they
stepped
out
for
the
new
year
is
a
great
time
in
france
lights
twinkled
in
the
misty
dark
taxis
sprinted
across
the
open
spaces
and
people
greeted
each
other
gaily
by
the
shops
somehow
or
another
the
whole
thing
went
to
peter
head
like
wine
the
world
was
good
and
merry
he
thought
exultantly
and
he
after
all
a
citizen
of
it
he
caught
julie
arm
come
on
he
called
to
the
others
i
know
the
way
and
to
her
it
topping
do
you
feel
gloriously
exhilarated
i
do
know
why
julie
but
i
could
do
anything
she
slipped
her
fingers
down
into
his
hand
i
so
glad
she
said
so
could
i
they
whirled
across
the
road
the
others
after
them
round
the
little
park
in
the
centre
of
the
square
and
down
an
empty
peter
had
reconnoitred
all
approaches
he
said
and
this
was
the
best
way
begging
him
to
give
her
time
to
breathe
tommy
came
along
with
donovan
and
it
suddenly
struck
peter
that
the
latter
seemed
happy
enough
he
pressed
julie
hand
donovan
dropped
into
step
with
tommy
very
easily
he
said
do
you
mind
she
laughed
happily
and
glanced
back
you
as
blind
as
a
bat
peter
when
all
said
and
done
she
said
but
oh
my
dear
i
ca
play
with
you
there
only
one
person
i
want
to
walk
with
peter
peter
all
but
shouted
he
drew
her
to
him
and
for
once
julie
was
honestly
alarmed
not
now
you
mad
boy
she
exclaimed
but
her
eyes
were
enough
for
him
all
right
he
laughed
at
her
wait
a
bit
there
time
yet
in
the
little
the
greeted
them
they
were
the
party
of
importance
that
night
he
ushered
them
upstairs
and
opened
a
door
the
mademoiselles
might
make
the
toilette
there
another
door
they
would
eat
here
the
men
deposited
their
caps
and
sticks
and
coats
on
pegs
outside
and
the
girls
who
had
had
to
come
in
uniform
also
were
ready
as
soon
as
they
they
went
in
together
elsie
gave
a
little
whistle
of
surprise
peter
had
certainly
done
well
holly
and
mistletoe
were
round
the
walls
and
a
big
bunch
of
the
latter
was
placed
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
hang
over
the
party
as
they
sat
afterwards
by
the
fire
in
the
centre
a
silver
bowl
held
glorious
roses
white
and
red
and
at
each
girl
place
was
a
bunch
of
parma
violets
and
a
few
sprigs
of
flowering
mimosa
were
spread
over
the
white
cloth
julie
looked
perfect
and
so
did
the
i
trust
that
monsieur
is
satisfied
said
the
bowing
towards
the
man
who
had
had
the
dealings
with
him
he
got
his
answer
but
not
from
peter
and
being
a
frenchman
smiled
bowed
again
and
discreetly
left
the
room
for
elsie
turning
to
peter
cried
did
you
do
it
even
the
wattle
and
kissed
him
heartily
he
kissed
her
back
and
caught
hold
of
julie
tit
for
tat
he
said
to
her
under
his
breath
holding
her
arms
do
you
remember
our
first
taxi
then
louder
julie
is
responsible
for
most
of
it
and
he
kissed
her
too
they
sorted
themselves
out
at
last
and
the
dinner
that
two
of
them
at
least
who
were
there
that
night
were
never
to
forget
began
they
were
uproariously
merry
and
the
two
girls
who
waited
came
and
went
wreathed
in
smiles
with
the
champagne
came
a
discussion
over
the
cork
give
it
to
me
cried
julie
i
want
to
wear
it
for
luck
so

said
elsie

it
julie
agreed
and
they
spun
a
coin
solemnly
it
mine
cried
elsie
and
pounced
for
it
julie
snatched
it
away
no
you

she
said
a
man
must
put
it
in
or
there
no
luck
in
it
here
you

trevor
pennell
took
it
laughing
and
pushed
back
his
chair
the
others
stood
up
and
craned
over
to
see
elsie
drew
up
her
skirt
and
trevor
pushed
it
down
her
stocking
amid
screams
of
laughter
and
the
rattle
of
chaff
no
higher
or
i
faint
said
tommy
trevor
stood
up
a
little
flushed
here

peter

his
glass
with
what

the
bottle

at

elsie
who

retorted
julie
peter
of
course
my
dear
you

peter
let
show
them
she
tossed
the
cork
to
him
and
stood
up
coolly
put
up
her
foot
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
lifted
her
skirt
peter
pushed
the
cork
into
its
traditional
place
amid
cheers
but
he
hardly
heard
his
fingers
had
touched
her
skin
and
he
had
seen
the
look
in
her
eyes
no
wine
could
have
intoxicated
him
so
he
raised
his
glass
toasts
he
shouted
they
took
him
up
and
everyone
rose
to
their
feet
to
all
those
that
i
love
here
to
all
those
that
love
me
here
to
all
those
that

he
chanted
julie
turn
cried
elsie
no
she
said
they
know
all
my
toasts
not
all
said
donovan
there
was
one
you
never
finished
something
about
blighty
rhymes
with
nighty
put
in
tommy
coolly
do
you
remember
julie
it
seemed
to
peter
that
he
and
julie
stood
there
looking
at
each
other
for
seconds
but
probably
no
one
but
tommy
noticed
take
it
as
read
cried
peter
boisterously
and
emptied
his
glass
his
example
was
infectious
and
they
all
followed
suit
but
donovan
remarked
across
the
table
to
him
you
spoiled
a
humorous
situation
old
dear
dinner
over
they
pushed
the
table
against
the
wall
and
pulled
chairs
round
the
fire
dessert
crackers
chocolates
and
cigarettes
were
piled
on
a
small
table
and
the
famous
liqueur
came
in
with
the
coffee
they
filled
the
little
glasses
this
is
a
great
occasion
said
donovan
let
celebrate
it
properly
julie
give
us
a
dance
first
she
sprang
up
at
once
she
said
clear
the
table
they
pushed
everything
to
one
side
and
peter
held
out
his
hand
just
touching
his
fingers
she
leaped
up
and
next
minute
circled
there
in
a
whirl
of
skirts
a
piano
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
elsie
ran
to
it
looking
over
her
shoulder
she
caught
the
pace
and
the
notes
rang
out
merrily
julie
was
the
very
spirit
of
devilment
and
fun
so
light
that
she
seemed
hardly
to
touch
the
table
she
danced
as
if
born
to
it
it
was
such
an
incarnation
of
grace
and
music
that
a
little
silence
fell
on
them
all
to
peter
she
appeared
to
dance
to
him
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
he
cared
nothing
what
others
thought
or
saw
there
was
a
mist
before
him
and
thunder
in
his
ears
he
saw
only
her
flushed
childlike
face
and
sparkling
brown
eyes
and
a
wave
of
her
loosened
hair
that
slipped
across
them
the
music
ceased
panting
for
breath
she
leaped
down
amid
a
chorus
of
bravo
and
held
out
her
hand
for
the
peter
put
it
in
her
fingers
and
he
was
trembling
more
than
she
and
spilt
a
little
of
it
well
here
the
best
she
cried
and
raised
the
glass
then
with
a
gay
laugh
she
put
her
moistened
fingers
to
his
mouth
and
he
kissed
them
the
spirit
on
his
lips
and
now
elsie
must
show
herself
off
they
sat
down
to
watch
her
and
a
more
insidious
feeling
crept
over
peter
as
he
did
so
the
girl
bent
her
body
this
way
and
that
arched
herself
over
and
looked
at
them
between
her
feet
twisted
herself
awry
and
made
faces
at
them
they
laughed
but
there
was
a
new
note
in
the
laughter
an
intense
look
had
come
into
pennell
face
and
donovan
was
lolling
back
his
head
on
one
side
smiling
evilly
she
finished
and
straightened
herself
and
they
had
more
of
the
liqueur
then
tommy
as
usual
remembered
herself
girls
she
said
we
must
go
it
fearfully
late
donovan
sat
up
what
about
taxis
he
demanded
peter
went
to
the
door
they
fetch
them
he
said
i
made
an
arrangement
he
went
a
little
unsteadily
to
find
the
and
a
boy
was
despatched
while
he
settled
the
bill
they
were
tramping
down
the
stairs
as
he
came
out
of
the
little
office
julie
leading
and
laughing
uproariously
at
some
joke
donovan
and
tommy
were
the
steadiest
and
they
came
down
together
it
seemed
to
peter
that
it
was
natural
for
them
to
do
so
pennell
and
elsie
got
into
one
taxi
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
waved
her
hand
we
the
luckiest
she
called
we
the
farthest
to
go
everyone
and
thanks
ever
so
much
a
second
taxi
came
up
jump
in
julie
said
tommy
she
got
in
and
peter
put
his
hand
on
the
door
i
settled
everything
donovan
he
said
see
you
tommy
she
called
back
and
he
got
in
and
next
minute
he
was
alone
with
julie
in
the
closed
and
darkened
taxi
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
drew
her
to
him
oh
my
darling
he
murmured
julie
do
you
love
me
as
i
love
you
i
ca
live
without
you
he
covered
her
face
with
hot
kisses
and
she
kissed
him
back
julie
he
said
at
length
breathlessly
listen
my
leave
come
i
knew
this
morning
could
you
possibly
be
in
england
when
i
am
i
saw
you
first
on
the
boat
coming
over
remember
and
you
due
again
when
do
you

she
queried
fourteenth
he
answered
she
considered
i
could
get
off
by
then
she
said
but
i
might
the
or
thereabouts
i
due
as
you
say
and
i
think
it
could
be
managed
would
you
he
demanded
and
hung
on
her
words
she
turned
her
face
up
to
him
and
even
in
the
dark
he
could
see
her
glowing
eyes
it
would
be
heaven
peter
she
whispered
he
kissed
her
passionately
i
could
meet
you
in
town
easily
he
said
not
the
train
she
replied
it
not
safe
anyone
might
be
there
but
i
run
down
for
a
day
or
two
to
some
friends
in
sussex
and
then
come
up
to
visit
more
in
town
i
know
very
few
people
of
course
and
all
my
relations
are
in
south
africa
no
one
would
know
to
whom
i
went
and
if
i
did
go
to
them
peter
why
nobody
would
know
either
splendid
he
answered
the
blood
pounding
in
his
temples
i
make
all
the
arrangements
shall
i
take
a
flat
or
shall
we
go
to
an
hotel
an
hotel
more
fun
perhaps
and
we
can
have
a
suite
she
leaned
over
against
him
and
caught
his
hand
to
her
breast
with
a
little
intake
of
breath
i
leave
it
all
to
you
my
darling
she
whispered
the
taxi
swung
into
the
clearing
before
the
hospital
peter
said
julie
tommy
so
sharp
i
believe
she
suspect
something
i
do
care
a
damn
for
anyone
said
peter
fiercely
let
her
i
only
want
you
chapter
vi
peter
secured
his
leave
for
monday
the
from
boulogne
which
necessitated
his
leaving
le
havre
at
least
hours
before
that
day
there
were
two
ways
of
travelling
across
country
in
a
or
by
french
expresses
via
paris
he
had
heard
so
much
of
the
latter
plan
that
he
determined
to
try
it
it
had
appeared
to
belong
to
the
reputation
of
the
church
his
movement
order
was
simply
from
the
one
port
to
the
other
and
was
probably
good
enough
either
way
round
with
french
officials
but
there
was
a
paper
attached
to
it
indicating
that
the
personnel
in
question
would
report
at
such
a
time
to
the
at
such
a
station
and
the
time
and
the
station
spelt
unmistakably
now
the
set
out
on
its
devious
journey
an
hour
later
than
the
paris
express
from
the
same
station
and
the
hour
of
the
paris
express
corresponded
with
the
time
that
all
decent
officers
go
to
dinner
peter
therefore
removed
the
first
paper
folded
it
up
thoughtfully
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
then
reported
to
the
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
paris
train
started
and
found
as
he
expected
a
in
sole
charge
the
man
took
his
paper
and
read
it
he
turned
it
over
there
was
no
indication
of
route
anywhere
which
train
are
you
going
by
sir
he
asked
paris
mail
said
peter
coolly
will
you
please
put
my
stuff
in
a
first
certainly
sir
said
the
man
endorsed
the
order
to
that
effect
and
shouldered
a
peter
followed
him
he
was
given
a
first
to
himself
and
the
deputy
saw
the
french
inspector
and
showed
him
the
paper
peter
strolled
off
and
collected
a
bottle
of
wine
some
sandwiches
and
some
newspapers
then
he
made
himself
comfortable
the
train
left
punctually
peter
lay
back
in
his
corner
and
watched
the
country
slip
by
contentedly
he
had
grown
up
had
this
young
man
he
arrived
in
paris
with
the
dawn
of
sunday
morning
and
looked
out
cautiously
there
was
no
english
official
visible
however
his
papers
were
entirely
correct
and
he
climbed
up
the
stairs
and
wandered
along
a
corridor
in
which
hands
and
letters
from
time
to
time
indicated
the
lair
of
the
arriving
he
found
another
officer
waiting
but
no
the
other
was
bored
stiff
he
said
he
had
sat
there
an
hour
but
had
seen
no
sign
of
the
transport
officer
peter
smiled
and
replied
that
he
had
no
intention
whatever
of
waiting
he
only
wanted
to
know
the
times
of
the
boulogne
trains
these
he
discovered
by
the
aid
of
a
railway
guide
on
the
table
and
selected
the
midnight
train
which
would
land
him
in
boulogne
in
time
for
the
first
if
the
train
were
punctual
and
the
not
too
early
in
any
case
he
could
take
the
second
which
would
only
mean
victoria
a
few
hours
later
that
same
day
and
these
details
settled
he
left
his
luggage
in
a
corner
and
strolled
off
into
the
city
a
big
city
seen
for
the
first
time
by
oneself
alone
when
one
does
not
know
a
soul
in
it
may
be
intensely
boring
or
intensely
interesting
it
depends
on
oneself
peter
was
in
the
mood
to
be
interested
he
was
introspective
it
pleased
him
to
watch
the
early
morning
stir
to
see
the
women
come
out
in
shawls
and
slipshod
slippers
and
swill
down
their
bit
of
pavement
to
see
sleepy
shopkeepers
take
down
their
shutters
and
set
up
their
stalls
to
try
to
gauge
the
thoughts
and
doings
of
the
place
from
the
and
the
advertisements
his
first
need
was
a
wash
and
a
shave
and
he
got
both
at
a
little
in
which
monsieur
attended
to
him
while
madame
in
considerable
made
her
toilette
before
the
next
glass
his
second
was
breakfast
and
he
got
it
with
an
omelette
and
jam
in
a
hotel
and
then
set
up
he
strolled
off
for
the
centre
of
things
many
masses
were
in
progress
at
the
madeleine
and
he
heard
one
or
two
with
a
curious
contentment
but
they
had
no
lesson
for
him
probably
because
of
the
foreign
element
in
the
atmosphere
and
he
did
not
pray
still
he
sat
chiefly
and
watched
until
he
felt
how
entirely
he
was
a
stranger
here
and
went
out
into
the
sun
he
made
his
way
to
the
river
and
lingered
there
long
the
great
cathedral
with
its
bare
january
trees
silhouetted
to
the
last
twig
against
the
clear
sky
its
massive
buttresses
and
its
cluster
of
smaller
buildings
held
his
imagination
he
went
in
but
they
were
beginning
to
sing
mass
and
he
soon
came
out
he
crossed
to
the
farther
bank
and
found
a
seat
and
lit
a
pipe
sitting
there
his
imagination
awoke
he
conceived
the
pageant
of
faith
that
had
raised
those
walls
kings
and
lords
and
knights
all
the
glitter
and
gold
of
the
middle
ages
had
come
there
and
gone
bishops
and
archbishops
and
even
popes
had
had
their
day
of
splendour
there
and
gone
the
humbler
sort
in
the
peasant
dress
of
the
period
speaking
quaint
tongues
had
brought
their
sorrows
there
and
their
joys
and
gone
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
had
not
so
surely
gone
the
great
have
their
individual
day
and
disappear
but
the
poor
in
their
corporate
indistinguishableness
remain
the
multitude
petty
in
their
trivial
wants
and
griefs
find
no
historian
and
leave
no
monument
yet
ultimately
it
was
because
of
the
christian
faith
in
the
compassion
of
god
for
such
that
lifted
her
towers
to
the
sky
the
stage
for
the
mighty
doings
of
kings
it
was
the
home
of
the
people
as
he
had
seen
them
just
now
creeping
about
the
aisles
lighting
little
tapers
crouched
in
a
corner
so
had
they
always
been
kings
and
bishops
figured
for
a
moment
in
pomp
before
the
altar
and
then
monuments
must
be
erected
to
their
memory
but
it
was
not
so
with
the
poor
peter
in
a
glow
of
warmth
considered
that
he
was
in
truth
one
of
them
and
jesus
had
had
compassion
on
the
multitude
he
remembered
the
text
recalled
him
and
he
frowned
to
himself
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
and
set
out
leisurely
to
find
luncheon
the
famous
held
him
and
he
bought
a
print
or
two
in
a
restaurant
near
the
châtelet
he
got
and
then
remembering
julie
bought
and
wrote
a
and
took
a
taxi
for
the
bois
he
was
driven
about
for
an
hour
or
more
and
watched
the
people
lured
out
by
the
sun
watched
the
troops
of
all
the
armies
watched
an
aeroplane
swing
high
over
the
trees
and
soar
off
towards
versailles
he
discharged
his
car
at
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
set
about
deciphering
the
carven
pictures
then
he
walked
up
the
great
avenue
made
his
way
to
the
place
de
la
république
wandered
through
the
gardens
of
the
louvre
and
as
dusk
fell
found
himself
in
the
avenue
de
it
was
very
gay
he
had
a
bock
at
a
little
marble
table
and
courteously
declined
the
invitations
of
a
lady
of
considerable
age
painted
to
look
young
he
at
first
simply
refused
and
finally
cursed
into
silence
a
weedy
flash
youth
who
offered
to
show
him
the
sights
of
the
city
in
an
apparently
ascending
scale
till
he
reached
the
final
lure
of
a
and
he
dined
greatly
at
a
palace
of
a
restaurant
then
tired
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
a
girl
passing
smiled
at
him
and
he
smiled
back
she
came
and
sat
down
he
looked
bored
she
told
him
which
was
a
thing
one
should
not
be
in
paris
and
she
offered
to
assist
him
to
get
rid
of
the
plague
what
do
you
suggest
he
demanded
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
anything
that
he
pleased
but
i
do
know
what
i
want
he
objected
ah
well
i
have
a
flat
near
she
said
a
charming
flat
we
need
not
be
bored
there
peter
demurred
he
had
to
catch
the
midnight
train
she
made
a
little
gesture
there
was
plenty
of
time
he
regarded
her
attentively
see
mademoiselle
he
said
i
do
not
want
that
but
i
am
alone
and
i
want
company
will
you
not
stroll
about
paris
with
me
for
an
hour
or
two
and
talk
she
smiled
monsieur
was
unreasonable
she
had
her
time
to
consider
she
could
not
waste
it
peter
took
his
case
from
his
pocket
and
selected
a
note
folded
it
and
handed
it
to
her
without
a
word
she
slipped
it
into
her
bag
give
me
a
cigarette
she
said
let
us
have
one
little
glass
here
and
then
we
will
go
on
to
an
i
know
and
hear
the
band
and
see
the
dresses
and
talk
is
it
not
so
he
could
not
have
found
a
better
companion
in
the
great
lounge
later
on
leaning
back
by
his
side
she
chatted
shrewdly
and
with
merriment
she
described
dresses
and
laughed
at
his
ignorance
she
acclaimed
certain
pieces
and
showed
a
real
knowledge
of
music
she
told
him
of
life
in
paris
when
the
hun
had
all
but
knocked
at
the
gates
of
the
gaiety
of
relief
of
things
big
and
little
of
the
flowers
in
the
bois
in
the
spring
he
said
little
but
enjoyed
himself
much
later
she
went
with
him
to
the
station
and
they
stood
outside
to
say
well
little
girl
he
said
you
have
given
me
a
good
evening
and
i
am
very
grateful
but
i
do
not
even
know
your
name
tell
it
me
that
i
may
remember
mariette
she
said
and
will
monsieur
not
take
my
card
he
may
be
in
paris
again
he
is
très
agréable
i
should
like
much
to
content
him
one
meets
many
but
there
are
few
one
would
care
to
see
again
peter
smiled
sadly
for
the
first
time
a
wistful
note
had
crept
into
her
voice
he
thought
of
others
like
her
that
he
knew
and
he
spoke
very
tenderly
no
mariette
he
said
if
i
came
back
i
might
spoil
a
memory
god
bless
you
and
he
held
out
his
hand
she
hesitated
a
second
then
she
turned
back
to
the
taxi
where
would
you
like
to
go
he
demanded
she
leaned
out
and
glanced
up
at
the
clock
de
she
said
vous
plait
the
man
thrust
in
the
clutch
with
his
foot
and
mariette
was
lost
to
peter
for
ever
in
the
multitude
in
boulogne
he
heard
that
he
was
late
for
the
first
boat
but
caught
the
second
easily
remembering
donovan
advice
he
got
his
ticket
for
the
pullman
at
once
and
was
soon
rolling
luxuriously
to
town
the
station
was
bustling
as
it
had
done
what
seemed
to
him
an
age
before
but
he
stepped
out
with
the
feeling
that
he
was
no
longer
a
fresher
in
the
world
or
any
other
university
declining
assistance
he
walked
over
to
the
grosvenor
and
engaged
a
room
dined
and
then
strolled
out
into
victoria
street
it
was
all
so
familiar
and
it
was
all
so
different
he
stood
aloof
and
looked
at
himself
and
played
with
the
thought
it
was
incredible
that
he
was
the
peter
graham
of
less
than
a
year
before
and
that
he
walked
where
he
had
walked
a
score
of
times
he
went
up
whitehall
and
across
the
square
and
hesitated
whether
or
not
he
should
take
the
strand
deciding
against
it
he
made
his
way
to
piccadilly
circus
and
chose
a
that
advertised
a
comedian
he
heard
him
and
came
out
still
laughing
to
himself
and
then
he
walked
down
piccadilly
to
hyde
park
corner
and
stood
for
a
minute
looking
up
park
lane
hilda
ought
to
come
down
he
said
to
himself
amusedly
then
marvelling
that
he
could
be
amused
at
all
at
the
thought
he
turned
off
for
his
hotel
it
is
nothing
to
write
down
but
to
peter
it
was
very
much
everything
was
old
but
everything
was
new
to
him
at
his
hotel
he
smoked
a
cigarette
in
the
lounge
just
to
watch
the
men
and
women
who
came
and
went
and
then
he
declined
the
lift
and
ascended
the
big
staircase
to
his
room
as
he
went
it
struck
him
why
it
was
that
he
felt
so
much
wiser
than
he
had
been
that
he
looked
on
london
from
the
inside
whereas
he
had
used
to
look
from
the
outside
only
that
he
looked
with
a
charity
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
and
that
he
was
amazingly
content
and
as
he
got
into
bed
he
thought
that
when
next
he
slept
in
town
he
would
not
be
alone
he
would
have
crossed
tommy
rubicon
next
morning
he
went
down
into
the
country
to
relations
who
did
not
interest
him
at
all
but
he
walked
and
rode
and
enjoyed
the
english
countryside
with
zest
he
went
to
the
little
country
church
on
the
sunday
twice
to
matins
and
evensong
and
he
came
home
and
read
that
chapter
of
wells
book
in
which
britling
expounds
the
domestication
of
god
and
he
had
some
fierce
moments
in
which
he
thought
of
louise
and
of
lucienne
sister
and
of
mariette
and
of
pennell
and
last
of
all
of
jenks
and
asked
himself
of
what
use
a
domesticated
god
could
be
to
any
of
them
and
then
on
the
thursday
he
came
up
to
meet
julie
it
thrilled
him
that
she
was
in
england
somewhere
and
preparing
to
come
to
him
his
pulses
beat
so
as
he
thought
of
it
that
every
other
consideration
was
temporarily
driven
from
his
mind
but
presently
he
caught
himself
thinking
what
ought
to
be
done
and
of
what
she
would
be
like
he
turned
it
over
in
his
mind
he
had
known
her
in
france
in
uniform
when
he
was
not
sure
of
her
but
now
what
would
she
be
like
he
could
not
conceive
and
he
banished
the
idea
it
would
be
more
splendid
when
it
occurred
if
he
had
made
no
imaginary
construction
of
it
his
station
was
king
cross
and
he
took
a
taxi
to
a
big
central
hotel
in
the
neighbourhood
of
regent
street
and
as
he
passed
its
doors
they
closed
irrevocably
on
his
past
the
girl
at
the
bureau
looked
up
and
smiled
she
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
we
are
very
full
he
replied
i
expect
you
are
but
my
wife
is
coming
up
to
town
this
afternoon
and
we
have
only
a
few
days
together
we
want
to
be
as
central
as
possible
have
you
a
small
suite
over
the
i
do
know
she
said
and
pulled
the
big
book
toward
her
she
ran
a
finger
down
the
page
she
said
double
bedroom
and
bathroom
how
would
that
do
it
sounds
capital
said
peter
may
i
go
and
see
it
she
turned
in
her
seat
reached
for
a
key
and
touched
a
button
a
man
appeared
soundlessly
on
the
thick
rich
carpet
show
this
officer
will
you
she
said
and
turned
to
someone
else
what
means
so
much
to
some
of
us
is
everyday
business
to
others
peter
followed
across
the
hall
and
into
a
lift
they
went
up
high
got
out
in
a
corridor
took
a
turn
to
the
right
and
stopped
before
a
door
numbered
the
man
opened
it
peter
was
led
into
a
little
hall
with
two
doors
leading
from
it
the
first
room
was
the
it
was
charmingly
furnished
and
very
cosy
a
couple
of
good
prints
on
the
walls
wide
fireplace
a
tall
standard
lamp
some
delightfully
easy
chairs
all
this
he
took
in
at
a
glance
he
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
far
below
was
the
great
thoroughfare
and
beyond
a
wilderness
of
roofs
and
spires
he
stood
and
gazed
at
it
london
seemed
a
different
place
up
there
he
felt
remote
and
looked
again
into
the
street
its
business
rolled
on
indifferent
to
him
and
unaware
he
glanced
back
into
the
snug
pretty
little
room
how
easy
it
all
was
how
secure
this
is
excellent
he
said
show
me
the
bedroom
this
way
sir
said
the
man
the
bedroom
was
large
and
airy
a
pretty
light
paper
covered
the
walls
and
two
beds
stood
against
one
of
them
side
by
side
the
sun
shone
in
at
the
big
double
windows
and
fell
on
the
white
paint
of
the
woodwork
the
tops
of
the
and
the
thick
carpet
a
door
was
open
on
his
right
he
walked
across
and
looked
in
there
too
a
tiled
bathroom
he
saw
it
was
the
clean
towels
on
the
highly
polished
brass
rail
heated
by
steam
the
against
the
wall
the
shower
douche
and
spray
all
complete
even
the
big
cake
of
soap
on
its
sliding
rack
across
the
bath
he
looked
as
a
man
in
a
might
look
it
was
as
if
an
enchanted
palace
with
the
princess
just
round
the
corner
had
been
offered
him
smiling
at
the
conceit
he
turned
to
the
man
i
did
notice
the
telephone
he
said
i
suppose
it
is
installed
in
each
room
sir
said
the
man
that
will
do
said
peter
it
will
suit
me
admirably
have
my
baggage
sent
up
will
you
and
say
that
i
engage
the
suite
i
will
be
down
presently
yes
sir
said
the
man
and
departed
peter
went
back
to
the
and
threw
himself
into
a
chair
then
he
had
an
idea
got
up
went
to
the
telephone
ordered
a
bottle
of
whisky
to
be
sent
up
and
a
siphon
and
went
back
to
his
seat
presently
he
was
pouring
himself
out
a
drink
and
smoking
a
cigarette
on
his
own
temporary
the
little
incident
increased
his
satisfaction
he
was
reassuring
himself
here
he
was
really
safe
and
remote
and
master
with
a
thousand
servants
and
a
huge
palace
at
his
beck
and
call
and
all
for
a
few
pounds
it
was
absurd
but
he
thought
to
himself
that
he
was
feeling
civilised
for
the
first
time
perhaps
he
looked
round
and
considered
julie
what
would
she
want
flowers
to
begin
with
heaps
of
them
she
liked
violets
for
one
thing
and
by
hook
or
by
crook
he
would
get
a
little
wattle
or
mimosa
to
remind
her
of
africa
then
chocolates
and
cigarettes
both
must
never
be
lacking
and
a
few
books
no
not
books
magazines
and
he
would
have
some
wine
sent
up
what
else
biscuits
after
the
theatre
they
might
be
jolly
ah
the
theatre
he
must
book
seats
well
a
box
would
be
better
they
did
not
want
to
run
too
great
a
risk
of
being
seen
donovan
was
quite
possibly
in
town
to
say
nothing
of
older
friends
possibly
considering
the
run
on
the
theatres
he
had
better
book
up
fairly
completely
for
the
days
they
had
together
but
what
would
she
like
julie
would
never
want
to
go
if
she
did
not
spontaneously
fancy
a
play
it
was
a
portentous
question
and
he
considered
it
long
finally
he
decided
on
measures
leaving
some
time
free
time
how
did
it
go
by
jove
he
ought
to
make
a
move
luncheon
first
his
last
meal
alone
for
some
time
then
order
the
things
and
victoria
at
he
poured
himself
another
short
drink
and
went
out
he
lunched
in
a
big
public
and
chatted
with
a
naval
officer
at
his
table
who
was
engaged
in
with
a
the
latter
was
not
vastly
enthusiastic
over
things
but
was
chiefly
depressed
because
he
had
to
report
at
a
naval
base
that
night
and
his
short
london
leave
was
all
but
run
out
tell
you
what
he
said
i
seen
a
good
many
cities
one
way
and
another
from
san
francisco
to
singapore
and
i
know
paris
and
brussels
and
berlin
but
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
there
no
better
place
for
ten
days
leave
than
this
same
old
blessed
london
you
can
have
some
spree
out
east
if
you
want
it
but
you
can
get
much
the
same
if
not
better
here
if
a
fellow
wants
a
bit
of
a
skirt
he
can
get
as
good
a
pick
in
london
as
anywhere
if
you
want
a
good
show
there
is
another
spot
in
the
universe
that
can
beat
it
whatever
it
is
you
feel
like
if
you
want
to
slip
out
of
sight
for
a
bit
give
me
a
big
hotel
like
this
in
london
they
do
worry
about
identification
papers
much
here
too
little
these
days
did
you
hear
of
those
german
submarine
officers
who
lived
in
an
hotel
in
southampton
peter
had
there
were
few
people
who
had
seeing
that
the
same
officers
lived
in
most
of
the
coast
towns
in
england
that
year
but
it
is
a
pity
to
damp
enthusiasm
he
said
he
had
heard
a
little
walked
in
and
out
cool
as
you
please
when
they
were
drowned
and
picked
up
at
sea
they
had
bills
and
theatre
tickets
in
their
pockets
and
a
letter
acknowledging
the
booking
of
rooms
for
the
next
week
fact
had
it
from
the
fellow
who
got
and
i
ask
you
what
is
there
to
prevent
it
you
come
here
you
write
your
name
and
regiment
please
you
write
the
damned
thing
any
old
thing
in
fact
and
what
happens
nothing
they
do
refer
to
them
in
france
the
lists
go
to
a
central
bureau
every
day
but
here
lord
bless
you
the
kaiser
himself
might
put
up
anywhere
if
he
shaved
his
moustache
peter
heard
him
well
content
he
offered
a
cigarette
feeling
warmly
disposed
towards
the
world
at
large
the
naval
officer
took
it
thanks
he
said
you
in
town
for
long
no
said
peter
a
week
end
i
only
just
happened
what
worth
seeing
first
and
last
all
the
way
it
a
dream
wonderful
by
gad
i
do
know
how
that
girl
does
it
then
i
try
oh
and
go
to
never
know
you
at
the
cri
absolutely
toppin
a
perfect
scream
all
through
the
thing
at
daly
good
too
but
all
the
shows
are
good
though
i
reckon
lumme
you
would
think
the
war
was
on
they
all
touch
it
a
bit
better
i
like
but
you
might
knowing
the
real
thing
but
do
miss
if
you
have
to
stand
all
day
for
a
seat
in
the
gods
well
i
must
be
going
damned
rough
luck
but
no
help
for
it
let
have
a
last
spot
eh
peter
agreed
and
the
drinks
were
ordered
said
his
acquaintance
and
here
to
old
london
town
and
the
good
lord
let
me
see
it
again
it
less
than
even
chances
he
added
reflectively
here
luck
said
peter
then
for
he
could
help
it
it
you
chaps
by
god
that
are
winning
this
war
oh
i
do
know
said
the
other
rising
we
get
more
leave
than
you
fellows
and
i
sooner
be
on
my
tramp
than
in
the
trenches
the
good
and
clean
to
die
in
anyway
cheerio
peter
followed
him
out
in
a
few
minutes
and
set
about
his
shopping
he
found
a
florist
in
regent
street
and
bought
lavishly
the
girl
smiled
at
him
and
suggested
this
and
that
having
a
dinner
somewhere
she
queried
but
i
have
no
violets
got
my
girl
comin
up
said
peter
expansively
that
why
there
must
be
violets
see
if
you
can
get
me
some
and
send
them
over
will
you
he
asked
naming
his
hotel
she
promised
to
do
her
best
and
he
departed
he
went
into
a
chocolate
shop
got
some
really
decent
chocolates
he
demanded
the
girl
smiled
and
dived
under
the
counter
these
are
the
best
she
said
holding
out
a
shovelful
for
peter
to
taste
he
tried
one
do
he
said
give
me
a
couple
of
pounds
in
a
pretty
box
if
you
got
one
two
pounds
she
exclaimed
what
are
you
thinking
of
we
can
only
sell
a
quarter
only
a
quarter
said
peter
that
no
good
come
on
make
up
the
two
pounds
if
my
boss
comes
in
or
finds
out
i
be
fired
said
the
girl
be
done
well
that
does
matter
said
peter
innocently
you
easily
get
a
job
something
better
and
easier
i
expect
it
easy
enough
perhaps
said
the
girl
but
you
never
can
tell
it
dangerous
uncertain
peter
stared
at
her
when
he
bought
chocolates
as
a
parson
he
never
had
talks
like
this
he
wondered
if
london
had
changed
since
he
knew
it
then
he
played
up
you
pretty
enough
to
knock
that
last
out
anyway
he
said
am
i
she
demanded
do
you
mean
you
like
to
keep
me
i
got
one
left
of
leave
said
peter
what
about
the
chocolates
poor
boy
she
said
well
i
risk
it
and
she
made
up
the
two
pounds
he
wandered
into
a
tobacconist
and
bought
cigarettes
which
soul
loved
and
then
he
made
for
a
theatre
outside
and
his
business
done
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
he
had
a
bit
of
time
to
spare
he
walked
down
shaftesbury
avenue
and
thought
he
would
get
himself
spruced
up
at
a
hairdresser
he
saw
a
little
place
with
a
foreigner
at
the
door
and
he
went
in
it
was
a
tiny
room
with
three
seats
all
empty
the
man
seated
him
in
one
and
began
peter
discovered
that
his
hair
needed
this
and
that
and
being
in
a
good
temper
and
an
idle
mood
acquiesced
presently
a
girl
came
in
peter
smelt
her
enter
and
then
saw
her
in
the
glass
she
was
short
and
dark
and
foreign
too
and
she
wore
a
blouse
that
appeared
to
have
remarkably
little
beneath
it
and
to
be
about
to
slip
off
her
shoulders
she
came
forward
and
stood
between
him
and
the
glass
smiling
would
you
like
your
nails
manicured
she
demanded
oh
i
do
know
said
peter
i
had
not
meant
to
and
was
lost
second
thoughts
are
best
she
said
but
let
me
look
at
your
hands
oh
i
should
think
you
did
need
it
whatever
will
your
girl
say
to
you
if
you
have
hands
like
this
peter
humiliated
looked
at
his
hands
they
did
not
appear
to
him
to
differ
much
from
the
hands
julie
and
others
had
seen
without
visible
consternation
before
but
he
had
no
time
to
say
so
the
young
lady
was
now
seated
by
his
side
with
a
basin
of
hot
water
and
was
dabbling
his
hand
in
it
nice
not
too
hot
she
inquired
brightly
peter
watched
her
as
she
bent
over
her
work
and
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
talk
he
gathered
that
many
officers
habitually
were
manicured
by
her
many
of
them
in
their
own
rooms
it
was
lucky
for
him
that
she
was
not
out
possibly
he
would
like
to
make
an
appointment
she
could
come
early
or
late
no
then
she
thought
his
own
must
be
a
poor
one
judging
from
these
hands
and
perhaps
she
could
sell
him
another
no
well
a
little
cream
not
he
would
look
in
he
had
a
chance
she
would
tell
him
what
where
was
he
staying
peter
for
the
fun
of
it
told
her
he
had
a
private
suite
in
the
hotel
well
that
was
splendid
she
would
call
in
with
a
new
set
at
any
time
before
breakfast
after
the
theatre
as
he
pleased
bring
the
cream
and
do
his
hands
once
with
it
to
show
him
how
how
would
that
suit
him
peter
was
not
required
to
say
for
at
that
minute
the
rang
and
a
priest
came
in
a
little
old
man
in
a
black
cassock
he
was
apparently
known
though
he
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
anyone
the
man
was
all
civility
but
put
on
an
expression
meant
to
indicate
amusement
to
peter
behind
the
clerical
back
the
girl
put
one
of
peter
fingers
on
her
own
lips
by
way
of
directing
caution
and
continued
more
or
less
in
silence
the
room
became
all
but
silent
save
for
the
sound
of
scissors
and
the
noise
of
the
traffic
outside
and
peter
reflected
again
on
many
things
when
he
had
had
his
hair
cut
previously
for
instance
had
people
made
faces
behind
his
back
had
young
ladies
ceased
from
tempting
offers
that
seemed
to
include
more
than
manicuring
he
got
up
to
pay
well
she
demanded
what
of
the
arrangement
she
could
do
him
easily
at
any
he
cut
her
short
no
it
was
really
impossible
his
wife
was
coming
up
that
afternoon
it
was
plain
that
she
now
regarded
it
as
impossible
also
he
paid
an
enormous
sum
wonderingly
and
departed
outside
it
struck
him
that
he
had
forgotten
one
thing
he
walked
briskly
to
the
hotel
and
went
up
to
his
rooms
in
the
was
the
big
bunch
of
flowers
and
a
maid
unwrapping
it
she
turned
and
smiled
at
him
these
have
just
come
for
you
sir
she
said
shall
i
arrange
them
for
you
no
thank
you
said
peter
i
rather
do
them
myself
i
love
arranging
flowers
and
i
know
just
what
my
wife
likes
i
expect
you
do
them
better
but
i
have
a
shot
if
you
do
mind
would
you
fill
the
glasses
and
get
me
a
few
more
we
have
enough
here
certainly
sir
there
was
a
gentleman
here
once
who
did
flowers
beautifully
he
did
but
most
likes
us
to
do
it
for
them
she
departed
for
the
glasses
peter
saw
that
the
florist
had
secured
his
violets
and
took
them
first
and
filled
a
bowl
then
he
walked
into
the
bedroom
and
contemplated
for
a
minute
then
he
put
the
violets
critically
on
the
little
table
by
the
bed
nearest
the
window
and
stood
back
to
see
the
result
finding
it
good
he
departed
when
next
he
came
in
it
was
to
place
a
great
bunch
of
roses
on
the
mantelshelf
and
a
few
sprays
of
the
soft
yellow
and
green
mimosa
on
the
for
the
he
had
carnations
and
delphiniums
and
he
placed
a
high
towering
cluster
of
the
latter
on
the
and
a
vase
of
the
former
on
the
mantelpiece
a
few
roses
left
over
went
on
the
small
table
that
carried
the
and
he
and
the
chambermaid
surveyed
the
results
lovely
i
do
think
she
said
any
lady
would
love
them
i
likes
flowers
myself
i
do
i
come
from
the
country
sir
where
there
a
many
and
the
wild
flowers
that
jack
and
i
liked
best
of
all
specially
primroses
sir
there
was
a
sound
in
her
voice
as
she
turned
away
and
peter
heard
it
jack
he
queried
softly
been
missing
since
last
july
sir
she
said
stopping
by
the
door
has
he
said
peter
well
you
must
not
give
up
hope
you
know
he
may
be
a
prisoner
she
shook
her
head
he
dead
she
said
with
an
air
of
finality
i
ought
to
have
spoke
a
word
but
them
flowers
reminded
me
i
glad
as
how
i
have
to
do
these
rooms
sir
most
of
them
do
bother
with
flowers
is
there
anything
else
you
might
be
wanting
sir
light
fires
in
both
the
grates
please
he
said
i
so
sorry
about
jack
he
added
she
gave
him
a
look
and
passed
out
peter
wandered
about
touching
this
and
that
suddenly
he
remembered
the
magazines
he
ran
out
and
caught
a
lift
about
to
descend
and
was
once
more
in
the
street
near
leicester
square
was
a
big
foreign
shop
and
he
entered
it
and
gathered
of
all
kinds
as
he
went
to
pay
he
saw
vie
and
added
that
also
to
the
bundle
julie
used
to
say
she
loved
it
back
in
the
hotel
he
sent
them
to
his
room
and
glanced
at
his
watch
he
had
time
for
tea
he
went
out
into
the
lounge
and
ordered
it
sitting
back
under
the
palms
it
came
and
he
was
in
the
act
of
pouring
out
a
cup
when
he
saw
donovan
donovan
was
with
a
girl
but
so
were
most
men
peter
could
not
be
sure
of
her
it
was
only
a
glimpse
he
had
for
the
two
had
finished
and
were
passing
out
donovan
stood
back
to
let
her
first
through
the
great
and
then
pulling
on
his
gloves
followed
they
both
disappeared
peter
sat
on
in
a
tumult
he
had
been
too
busy
all
day
to
reflect
much
but
now
just
what
he
was
about
to
do
began
to
overwhelm
him
if
donovan
met
him
with
julie
well
they
could
pretend
they
had
just
met
they
could
even
part
and
meet
again
could
they
would
donovan
be
deceived
for
a
minute
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
and
he
might
be
staying
there
suppose
he
met
someone
else
langton
sir
robert
doyle
his
late
vicar
hilda
lessing
and
julie
would
have
acquaintances
too
he
shook
himself
mentally
and
lit
a
cigarette
well
suppose
they
did
he
was
finished
with
them
finished
then
what
lay
ahead
what
after
this
if
he
were
discovered
and
if
he
were
not
discovered
god
knew
his
mind
took
a
new
train
of
thought
he
was
now
just
such
a
one
as
donovan
or
as
pennell
as
langton
he
was
sure
no
he
thought
not
langton
kept
straight
because
he
had
a
wife
and
kids
he
had
a
centre
donovan
and
pennell
had
not
apparently
well
he
peter
graham
would
have
a
centre
he
would
marry
julie
it
would
be
heavenly
they
had
not
spoken
of
it
of
course
that
night
of
the
dinner
but
surely
julie
would
there
could
be
no
doubt
after
the
i
sha
marry
or
be
given
in
marriage
she
had
said
it
was
like
her
to
speak
so
but
of
course
she
did
mean
it
no
he
would
marry
and
then
he
blew
out
smoke
the
colonies
south
africa
he
would
get
a
job
schoolmastering
he
hated
the
idea
it
did
interest
him
a
farm
he
knew
nothing
about
it
besides
one
wanted
capital
what
would
he
do
what
did
he
want
to
do
that
was
it
how
did
he
want
to
spend
his
life
well
he
wanted
julie
everything
else
would
fit
round
her
everything
else
would
be
secondary
beside
her
of
course
and
as
he
got
old
it
would
still
be
the
same
though
he
could
not
imagine
either
of
them
old
but
still
when
they
did
get
old
his
work
would
seem
more
important
and
what
was
it
to
be
probably
it
would
have
to
be
schoolmastering
teaching
latin
to
little
boys
history
geography
mathematics
he
smiled
ruefully
even
factors
worried
him
they
would
hardly
want
latin
and
greek
much
in
the
colonies
either
perhaps
at
home
but
would
julie
stop
at
home
what
julie
do
he
must
ask
her
sometime
before
monday
not
that
night
no
not
night
he
ground
his
cigarette
into
his
cup
and
pushed
his
hands
into
his
pockets
his
feet
out
before
him
that
night
he
saw
the
upstairs
they
would
go
there
first
then
he
would
suggest
a
dinner
to
her
in
soho
he
knew
a
place
that
pennell
had
told
him
of
bohemian
but
one
could
take
anyone
at
least
take
julie
it
would
be
jolly
watching
the
people
and
watching
julie
he
saw
her
mentally
opposite
him
and
her
eyes
sparkling
and
alluring
and
afterwards
warmed
and
fed
why
back
to
the
hotel
to
the
by
the
fire
they
would
have
a
little
supper
and
then
he
pictured
the
bedroom
he
would
let
julie
go
first
he
remembered
reading
in
a
novel
how
some
newly
married
wife
said
to
the
fellow
you
come
up
in
half
an
hour
or
so
wo
you
dear
he
could
all
but
see
the
words
in
print
and
so
in
half
an
hour
or
so
he
would
go
in
and
julie
would
be
in
bed
by
the
violets
and
he
he
would
know
what
men
talked
about
sometimes
in
the
anteroom
he
recalled
a
coarse
colonel
no
man
a
man
till
he
been
all
the
way
i
say
and
he
was
a
chaplain
a
priest
was
he
the
past
months
spun
before
him
his
sermons
his
talks
to
the
wounded
at
the
hospital
the
things
he
had
seen
the
stories
he
had
heard
he
sighed
it
was
all
a
dream
a
sham
there
was
no
reality
in
it
all
where
and
what
was
christ
an
ideal
yes
but
no
more
than
an
ideal
and
unrealisable
a
vision
of
the
beautiful
he
thought
he
had
seen
that
once
but
not
now
the
beautiful
ah
what
place
had
his
beauty
in
travalini
in
the
shattered
in
the
dinner
at
the
grand
in
havre
with
julie
julie
he
dwelt
on
her
eyes
hair
face
skin
and
lithe
figure
he
felt
her
kisses
again
on
his
lips
those
last
burning
kisses
of
new
night
and
they
were
all
to
be
his
as
never
before
julie
what
then
was
she
she
was
his
bride
his
wife
coming
to
him
consecrate
not
by
any
state
convention
not
by
any
ceremony
of
religion
but
by
the
pure
passion
of
human
love
virginal
clean
it
was
human
passion
perhaps
but
where
was
higher
love
or
greater
sacrifice
was
this
not
worthy
of
all
his
careful
preparation
worthy
of
the
one
centre
of
his
being
donovan
indeed
he
wished
he
had
stopped
and
told
him
the
whole
story
and
that
he
expected
julie
that
night
he
jumped
up
and
walked
out
in
the
steps
of
donovan
but
with
never
another
thought
of
him
a
boy
in
uniform
questioned
him
taxi
sir
he
nodded
and
the
commissionaire
pushed
back
the
great
he
stood
on
the
steps
and
watched
the
and
the
lights
all
shaded
as
they
were
that
began
to
usher
in
a
night
of
mystery
his
taxi
rolled
up
and
the
man
held
the
door
open
victoria
cried
peter
and
to
himself
as
he
sank
back
on
the
seat
julie
chapter
vii
julie
exclaimed
peter
i
should
hardly
have
known
you
you
do
look
topping
glad
rags
make
all
that
difference
old
boy
well
i
am
glad
you
did
know
me
anyhow
how
are
you
had
long
to
wait
only
ten
minutes
or
so
and
i
very
fit
and
just
dying
for
you
julie
she
smiled
up
at
him
and
blushed
a
little
are
you
peter
it
much
the
same
here
my
dear
but
do
you
think
we
had
better
get
a
move
on
and
not
stop
here
talking
all
night
peter
laughed
excitedly
rather
he
said
but
i
so
excited
at
seeing
you
that
i
hardly
know
if
i
on
my
head
or
my
heels
what
about
your
luggage
what
have
you
have
you
any
idea
where
it
is
there
a
taxi
waiting
i
have
much
a
big
most
important
because
it
holds
an
evening
dress
it
marked
with
my
initials
a
small
leather
trunk
borrowed
with
a
big
star
on
it
and
my
which
is
here
and
i
they
behind
but
i
would
swear
because
we
seemed
to
turn
round
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
journey
but
it
may
have
been
four
peter
chuckled
she
was
just
the
old
julie
but
yet
with
a
touch
of
something
more
shining
in
her
eyes
and
underlying
even
the
simplest
words
well
you
stand
aside
just
a
moment
and
i
go
and
see
he
said
and
he
hurried
off
in
the
crowd
julie
stood
waiting
patiently
by
a
while
the
world
bustled
about
her
she
wore
a
little
hat
with
a
gay
pheasant
wing
in
it
a
dark
green
travelling
dress
and
neat
brown
shoes
and
brown
silk
stockings
most
people
looked
at
her
as
they
passed
including
several
officers
but
there
was
a
different
look
in
her
brown
eyes
from
that
usually
there
and
they
all
passed
on
unhesitatingly
it
seemed
to
her
a
good
while
before
peter
came
up
again
in
his
wake
a
railway
amazon
with
the
trunk
on
her
shoulder
and
the
in
her
hand
sorry
to
keep
you
dear
he
said
but
there
was
a
huge
crush
and
next
to
no
porters
if
these
porters
it
feels
rotten
to
have
a
woman
carrying
one
luggage
but
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
come
on
are
you
tired
do
you
want
tea
i
am
a
little
she
said
and
i
do
a
bit
where
are
we
going
to
get
it
do
they
sell
teas
in
london
peter
or
have
you
taken
a
leaf
out
of
my
book
they
laughed
at
the
reminiscence
julie
said
peter
this
is
my
outfit
and
you
shall
see
what
you
think
of
it
give
me
your
ticket
will
you
i
want
to
see
you
through
myself
she
handed
him
a
little
purse
without
a
word
and
they
set
off
together
she
was
indulging
in
the
feeling
of
surrender
as
if
it
were
not
a
victory
she
had
won
and
he
was
glowing
with
the
sense
of
acquisition
as
if
he
had
really
acquired
something
julie
got
into
the
taxi
while
peter
settled
the
luggage
gave
directions
and
paid
the
amazon
then
he
climbed
in
and
pulled
the
door
to
and
they
slipped
out
of
the
crowded
into
the
roar
of
london
julie
put
her
hand
in
his
peter
she
said
do
tell
me
where
we
going
i
dying
to
know
what
arrangements
have
you
made
is
it
safe
he
leaned
over
her
his
eyes
sparkling
a
kiss
first
julie
no
one
will
see
and
it
does
matter
a
damn
if
they
do
that
the
best
of
london
my
dear
i
can
hardly
believe
we
both
here
at
last
and
that
i
really
got
you
their
lips
met
julie
flung
herself
back
with
a
laugh
oh
peter
she
said
i
shall
never
forget
that
first
taxi
if
you
could
have
seen
your
own
face
really
it
was
too
comic
but
i
must
say
you
changed
since
then
i
was
a
fool
and
a
beast
he
said
more
gravely
i
only
just
beginning
to
realise
how
much
of
a
fool
but
do
rub
it
in
julie
or
not
just
now
i
starting
to
live
at
last
and
i
do
want
to
be
reminded
of
the
past
she
pressed
his
hand
and
looked
out
of
window
where
are
we
peter
whitehall
where
are
we
off
to
i
got
the
snuggest
little
suite
in
all
london
darling
he
said
with
a
fairy
palace
at
our
beck
and
call
i
been
revelling
in
it
all
day
not
exactly
in
it
you
know
but
in
the
thought
of
it
i
been
too
busy
shopping
to
be
in
much
and
julie
i
hope
you
notice
my
hands
had
a
special
manicure
in
preparation
for
you
and
the
girl
is
coming
round
before
breakfast
to
do
me
again
or
at
least
she
wanted
to
what
are
you
talking
about
peter
what
have
you
been
doing
she
sighed
a
mock
sigh
really
you
getting
beyond
me
it
rather
trying
peter
launched
out
into
the
story
to
fill
up
time
he
really
did
not
want
to
speak
of
the
rooms
that
they
might
give
her
the
greater
surprise
so
he
kept
going
till
the
taxi
stopped
before
the
hotel
he
jumped
out
gaily
as
the
commissionaire
opened
the
door
come
on
he
said
as
quick
as
ever
you
can
then
to
the
man
have
these
sent
up
to
no
will
you
please
and
he
took
julie
arm
they
went
in
at
the
great
door
and
crossed
the
wide
everyone
glanced
at
julie
peter
noted
proudly
even
the
girls
behind
the
and
the
people
waiting
about
as
always
julie
held
her
head
high
and
walked
more
sedately
than
usual
she
a
bit
different
thought
peter
but
even
nicer
he
glowed
at
the
thought
he
led
her
to
the
lift
and
gave
his
landing
number
they
walked
down
the
corridor
in
silence
and
in
at
their
door
peter
opened
the
door
on
the
left
and
stood
back
julie
went
in
he
followed
and
shut
the
door
behind
them
the
maid
had
lit
a
fire
which
blazed
merrily
julie
took
it
all
in
the
flowers
the
pile
of
magazines
even
the
open
box
of
cigarettes
and
she
turned
enthusiastically
to
him
and
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
kissing
him
again
and
again
oh
peter
darling
she
cried
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
love
you
i
could
hardly
sit
still
in
the
railway
carriage
and
the
train
seemed
worse
than
a
french
one
but
now
i
have
you
at
last
and
all
to
myself
oh
peter
my
darling
peter
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
julie
disengaged
her
arms
from
his
neck
but
slipped
her
hand
in
his
and
he
said
come
in
the
maid
entered
carrying
tea
she
smiled
at
them
i
thought
madame
might
like
tea
at
once
sir
she
said
and
placed
the
tray
on
the
little
table
thank
you
ever
so
much
said
julie
impulsively
that
is
good
of
you
i
longing
for
it
one
gets
so
tired
in
the
train
then
she
walked
to
the
glass
i
take
off
my
hat
peter
she
said
and
my
coat
and
then
we
have
tea
comfortably
i
do
want
it
and
a
cigarette
you
an
angel
to
have
thought
of
my
own
de
reszke
she
threw
herself
into
a
big
basket
chair
and
leaned
over
to
the
table
milk
and
sugar
for
you
peter
by
the
way
i
ought
to
know
these
things
not
that
it
much
matters
ours
was
a
war
marriage
and
i
hardly
seen
you
at
all
peter
sat
opposite
and
watched
her
pour
out
she
leaned
back
with
a
piece
of
toast
in
her
hands
her
eyes
on
him
and
they
smiled
across
at
each
other
suddenly
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
put
his
cup
down
and
knelt
forward
at
her
feet
his
arms
on
her
knees
devouring
her
oh
julie
he
said
i
want
to
worship
you
i
do
indeed
i
ca
believe
my
luck
i
ca
think
that
love
her
white
teeth
bit
into
the
toast
you
old
silly
she
said
but
i
do
want
to
be
worshipped
i
be
worshipped
i
want
to
be
loved
peter
he
put
his
arms
up
and
pulled
her
head
down
to
his
kissing
her
again
and
again
stroking
her
arm
murmuring
foolish
words
that
meant
nothing
and
meant
everything
it
was
she
who
stopped
him
go
and
sit
down
she
said
and
tell
me
all
the
plans
well
he
said
i
do
hope
you
like
them
first
i
not
booked
up
anything
for
i
thought
we
go
out
to
dinner
to
a
place
i
know
and
sit
over
it
and
enjoy
ourselves
it
a
place
in
soho
and
quite
humorous
i
think
then
we
might
walk
back
london
so
perfect
at
night
is
it
i
got
seats
for
the
coliseum
matinee
you
know
it
of
course
it
a
jolly
place
where
one
can
talk
if
one
wants
to
and
smoke
and
then
i
seats
in
the
evening
for
saturday
night
we
going
to
see
which
they
say
is
the
best
show
in
town
and
saturday
morning
we
can
go
anywhere
you
please
or
do
anything
and
we
can
cut
out
any
of
them
if
you
like
he
added
she
let
her
arms
lie
along
the
chair
and
drew
a
breath
of
delight
you
truly
wonderful
she
said
what
a
blessing
not
having
to
worry
what
to
be
done
it
a
perfect
programme
i
only
wish
we
could
be
in
paris
for
sunday
it
so
slow
here
he
smiled
you
sure
you
not
bored
about
he
asked
she
looked
him
full
in
the
eyes
and
said
nothing
he
sprang
up
and
rushed
towards
her
she
laughed
her
old
gay
laugh
and
avoided
him
jumping
up
and
getting
round
the
table
no
she
warned
no
more
now
come
and
show
me
the
rest
of
the
establishment
arm
in
arm
they
made
the
tour
of
inspection
in
the
bathroom
julie
eyes
danced
thank
the
lord
for
that
bath
peter
she
said
i
shall
revel
in
it
that
one
thing
i
loathe
about
france
that
one
ca
get
decent
baths
and
in
the
country
here
it
no
better
i
had
two
inches
of
water
in
a
down
in
sussex
and
when
you
sit
in
the
beastly
thing
only
about
three
inches
of
yourself
get
wet
and
those
the
least
important
inches
i
shall
lie
in
this
for
hours
and
smoke
and
you
shall
feed
me
with
chocolates
and
read
to
me
how
will
you
like
that
peter
made
the
only
possible
answer
and
they
went
back
to
the
bedroom
the
man
was
bringing
up
her
luggage
and
he
deposited
it
on
the
heavens
said
julie
where
are
my
keys
oh
i
know
in
my
purse
i
hope
you
have
lost
it
do
give
it
to
me
the
is
beautifully
packed
but
the
trunk
is
in
an
appalling
mess
i
had
to
throw
my
things
in
anyhow
by
the
way
i
wonder
what
they
make
of
different
initials
on
all
our
luggage
not
that
it
matters
a
scrap
especially
these
days
besides
i
do
suppose
they
noticed
she
was
on
her
knees
by
the
trunk
and
had
undone
it
she
lifted
the
lid
and
peter
saw
the
confusion
inside
and
caught
sight
of
the
unfamiliar
clothes
julie
was
rummaging
everywhere
i
know
i
left
them
behind
she
exclaimed
whatever
shall
i
do
my
scent
and
peter
it
terrible
i
ca
go
to
soho
to
dinner
without
them
let
go
and
get
some
he
suggested
there
time
no
i
ca
she
said
you
go
do
be
long
i
want
to
sit
in
front
of
the
fire
and
be
cosy
peter
set
off
on
the
unfamiliar
errand
smiling
grimly
to
himself
he
got
the
scent
easily
enough
and
then
inquired
for
a
in
the
old
days
he
would
scarcely
have
dared
but
he
had
been
in
france
he
selected
a
little
french
box
with
a
mirror
in
the
lid
and
a
pretty
rosebud
pattern
and
paid
for
it
unblushingly
then
he
returned
he
opened
the
door
of
their
and
stood
transfixed
for
a
minute
the
shaded
was
on
the
other
lights
off
the
fire
glowed
red
and
julie
lay
stretched
out
in
a
big
chair
smoking
a
cigarette
she
turned
and
looked
up
at
him
over
her
shoulder
she
had
taken
off
her
dress
and
slipped
on
a
silk
kimono
letting
her
hair
down
which
fell
in
thick
tumbled
masses
about
her
the
arm
that
held
the
cigarette
was
stretched
up
above
her
and
the
wide
loose
sleeve
of
the
kimono
had
slipped
back
leaving
it
bare
to
her
shoulder
her
white
frilled
petticoat
showed
beneath
as
she
had
pushed
her
feet
out
before
her
to
the
warmth
of
the
fire
peter
blood
pounded
in
his
temples
good
boy
she
said
you
have
been
long
come
and
show
me
i
had
to
get
comfortable
i
hope
you
do
mind
he
came
slowly
forward
without
a
word
and
bent
over
her
the
scent
of
her
rose
intoxicatingly
around
him
as
he
bent
down
for
a
kiss
their
lips
clung
together
and
the
wide
world
stood
still
julie
made
room
for
him
beside
her
you
dear
old
thing
she
exclaimed
at
the
sight
of
the
it
a
gem
you
could
have
bettered
it
in
paris
she
opened
it
took
out
the
little
puff
and
dabbed
her
open
throat
then
laughing
she
dabbed
at
him
do
look
so
solemn
she
said
solomon
peter
slipped
one
arm
round
her
beneath
the
kimono
and
felt
her
warm
relaxed
waist
then
he
pushed
his
other
hand
unresisted
in
where
her
white
throat
gleamed
bare
and
open
to
him
and
laid
his
lips
on
her
hair
oh
julie
he
said
i
had
no
idea
one
could
love
so
it
is
almost
more
than
i
can
bear
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
struck
a
and
julie
stirred
in
his
arms
and
glanced
up
good
lord
peter
she
exclaimed
do
you
know
what
the
time
is
seven
i
shall
never
be
dressed
and
we
shall
get
no
dinner
let
me
up
for
goodness
sake
and
give
me
a
drink
if
got
such
a
thing
if
not
ring
for
it
i
shall
never
have
energy
enough
to
get
into
my
things
otherwise
peter
opened
the
little
door
of
the
sideboard
and
got
out
decanter
siphon
and
glasses
julie
sitting
up
and
arranging
herself
smiled
at
him
is
there
a
single
thing
you
have
thought
of
you
old
dear
she
said
say
when
said
peter
coming
towards
her
then
he
poured
himself
out
a
tumbler
and
stood
by
the
fire
looking
at
her
it
a
pity
we
have
to
go
out
at
all
he
said
for
i
suppose
you
go
like
that
a
pity
it
a
jolly
good
thing
you
wait
till
you
seen
my
frock
my
dear
but
peter
do
you
think
there
likely
to
be
anyone
there
that
we
know
he
shook
his
head
not
there
at
any
rate
he
said
here
more
likely
but
it
such
a
big
place
we
not
likely
to
meet
them
even
so
but
if
you
feel
nervous
do
you
know
the
best
cure
come
down
into
the
lounge
and
see
the
crowd
of
people
you
sit
there
and
people
stream
by
and
you
do
know
a
face
it
the
most
comfortable
feeling
in
the
world
one
more
alone
than
on
a
desert
island
you
might
be
a
ghost
that
no
one
sees
julie
shuddered
peter
do
you
make
me
feel
creepy
she
got
up
go
and
find
that
maid
will
you
i
want
her
to
help
me
dress
peter
walked
to
the
bell
and
rang
it
where
do
i
come
in
he
asked
well
you
can
go
and
wash
in
the
bathroom
and
if
you
frightened
of
her
you
can
dress
there
and
she
walked
to
the
door
laughing
i
just
finish
my
drink
he
said
you
will
be
heaps
longer
than
i
five
minutes
later
having
had
no
answer
to
his
ring
he
switched
off
the
light
and
walked
out
into
the
hall
he
hesitated
at
julie
door
then
he
tapped
come
in
she
said
she
was
standing
in
front
of
the
glass
doing
her
hair
oh
it
you
is
it
she
said
wherever
is
that
maid
i
ca
wait
all
night
for
her
you
have
to
help
peter
sat
down
and
began
to
change
he
watched
julie
moving
about
and
envied
her
careless
abandon
he
was
much
the
more
nervous
of
the
two
presently
she
called
him
from
the
bathroom
to
fasten
her
dress
when
it
was
done
she
stood
back
for
him
to
examine
her
that
all
right
she
demanded
putting
a
touch
here
and
there
not
every
woman
could
have
worn
her
gown
it
was
a
rose
pink
with
some
rich
material
in
front
and
was
held
by
two
of
the
narrowest
bands
on
her
shoulders
in
the
deep
she
pushed
two
rosebuds
from
the
big
bunch
and
hung
round
her
neck
a
pendant
of
and
silver
she
wore
no
other
jewellery
and
she
needed
none
she
faced
him
a
vision
of
loveliness
they
went
down
the
stairs
together
and
out
into
the
crush
of
people
some
of
the
women
in
evening
dress
but
few
of
the
men
the
many
uniforms
looked
better
peter
thought
despite
the
drab
khaki
they
had
to
stand
for
awhile
while
a
taxi
was
found
julie
laughing
and
chatting
vivaciously
she
had
a
wrap
for
her
shoulders
that
she
had
bought
in
port
said
set
with
small
metallic
points
and
it
sparkled
about
her
in
the
blaze
of
light
she
flattered
him
by
seeming
unconscious
of
anyone
else
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
as
they
went
out
they
drove
swiftly
through
to
the
restaurant
that
peter
had
selected
and
stopped
in
a
quiet
dark
narrow
road
off
greek
street
julie
got
out
and
looked
around
with
pretended
fear
where
in
the
world
have
you
brought
me
she
demanded
however
did
you
find
the
place
it
worse
than
some
of
your
favourite
places
in
havre
inside
however
she
looked
round
appreciatively
really
peter
splendid
she
said
under
her
breath
just
the
place
and
smiled
sweetly
on
the
padrone
who
came
forward
bowing
peter
had
engaged
a
table
and
they
were
led
to
it
i
had
almost
given
you
up
sir
said
the
man
but
by
good
fortune
some
of
our
patrons
are
late
too
they
sat
down
opposite
to
each
other
and
studied
the
menu
held
out
to
them
by
a
waiter
i
do
know
the
meaning
of
half
the
dishes
laughed
julie
you
order
it
be
more
fun
if
i
do
know
what
coming
we
must
drink
chianti
said
peter
and
ordered
a
bottle
you
can
think
you
are
in
italy
elbows
on
the
table
as
she
waited
julie
looked
round
in
the
far
corner
a
gay
party
of
four
were
halfway
through
dinner
two
officers
an
elderly
lady
and
a
young
one
she
found
rather
hard
to
place
but
julie
decided
the
girl
was
the
fiancée
of
one
who
had
brought
his
friend
to
meet
her
at
other
tables
were
mostly
couples
and
across
the
room
from
her
with
an
elderly
officer
sat
a
woman
very
plainly
immediately
before
her
were
four
men
two
of
them
foreigners
in
morning
dress
talking
and
eating
hare
it
was
evidently
a
professional
party
and
one
of
the
four
now
and
again
hummed
out
a
little
air
to
the
rest
and
once
jotted
down
some
notes
on
the
back
of
a
programme
they
took
no
notice
of
anyone
but
the
eyes
of
the
woman
with
the
officer
who
hardly
spoke
to
her
searched
julie
unblushingly
julie
gave
a
little
sigh
of
happiness
this
is
lovely
peter
she
said
we
be
ages
over
dinner
it
such
fun
to
be
in
nice
clothes
just
for
dinner
sometimes
and
not
to
have
to
worry
about
the
time
and
going
on
elsewhere
but
i
do
wish
my
friends
could
see
me
i
must
say
they
be
horrified
they
thought
i
was
going
to
a
stodgy
place
in
west
kensington
i
was
must
careful
to
be
vague
but
that
was
the
idea
peter
how
would
you
like
to
live
in
a
suburb
and
have
heaps
of
children
and
dine
out
with
city
men
and
their
wives
once
or
twice
a
month
for
a
treat
peter
grimaced
then
he
looked
thoughtful
it
would
have
been
any
so
remarkable
for
me
at
one
time
julie
he
said
she
shook
her
head
it
would
my
dear
you
not
made
for
it
what
am
i
made
for
then
she
regarded
him
solemnly
and
then
relaxed
into
a
smile
i
have
a
notion
but
not
that
the
thing
is
never
to
worry
you
get
what
made
for
in
the
end
i
think
i
wonder
said
peter
perhaps
but
not
always
the
world
full
of
square
pegs
in
round
holes
then
they
stodgy
pegs
without
anything
in
them
if
i
was
a
square
peg
i
never
go
into
a
round
hole
suppose
there
was
no
other
hole
to
go
into
demanded
peter
then
i
fall
out
or
i
would
go
into
any
hole
at
all
i
sooner
be
anything
in
the
world
than
stodgy
peter
i
sooner
be
like
that
woman
over
there
who
is
staring
at
me
so
peter
glanced
to
one
side
and
then
back
at
julie
he
was
rather
grave
would
you
really
he
questioned
the
waiter
brought
the
chianti
and
poured
out
glasses
julie
waited
till
he
had
gone
and
then
lifted
hers
and
looked
at
peter
across
it
i
would
she
said
i
could
live
without
wine
and
excitement
and
song
i
made
that
way
cheerio
solomon
they
drank
to
each
other
then
and
love
queried
peter
softly
julie
did
not
reply
for
a
minute
she
set
her
down
and
toyed
with
the
stem
then
she
looked
up
at
him
under
her
eyelashes
with
that
old
daring
look
of
hers
and
repeated
and
love
peter
but
real
love
not
stodgy
humdrum
liking
peter
i
want
the
love
that
like
the
hot
sun
and
the
wide
tossing
blue
sea
east
of
suez
and
the
nights
under
the
moon
where
the
real
world
wakes
up
and
does
go
to
sleep
like
it
does
in
the
country
in
the
cold
hard
north
do
you
know
she
went
on
though
i
love
the
cities
and
bands
and
restaurants
and
theatres
and
taxis
and
nice
clothes
i
love
best
of
all
the
places
where
one
has
none
of
these
things
i
once
went
with
a
to
east
africa
peter
and
that
what
i
love
i
shall
never
forget
the
nights
at
kilindini
with
the
fireflies
dancing
among
the
bushes
and
the
moon
glistening
on
the
palms
as
if
they
were
wet
and
the
insects
shrilling
in
the
grass
and
the
hot
damp
air
or
by
day
up
in
the
forest
camped
under
the
great
trees
with
the
strange
few
flowers
and
the
silence
while
the
sun
trickled
through
the
leaves
and
made
pools
of
light
on
the
ground
do
you
know
i
saw
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
ever
seen
or
i
think
shall
see
in
that
forest
what
was
that
asked
peter
under
her
spell
for
she
was
speaking
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
it
was
one
day
when
we
were
marching
we
came
on
a
glade
among
the
trees
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
little
depression
of
damp
green
grass
only
the
grass
was
quite
hidden
beneath
a
sheet
of
blue
such
blue
i
ca
describe
it
that
quivered
and
moved
in
the
sun
we
stood
quite
still
and
then
a
boy
threw
a
little
stone
and
the
blue
all
rose
in
the
air
silently
like
magic
it
was
a
swarm
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
blue
butterflies
peter
do
you
know
what
i
did
i
cried
i
could
help
it
it
was
too
beautiful
to
see
peter
a
little
silence
fell
between
them
she
broke
it
in
another
tone
and
the
natives
i
love
the
natives
i
just
love
the
all
but
naked
girls
carrying
the
water
up
to
the
village
in
the
evening
tall
and
straight
like
greek
statues
and
the
men
in
a
string
of
beads
and
a
spear
i
wanted
to
go
naked
myself
there
at
least
i
did
till
one
day
i
tried
it
and
the
sun
skinned
me
in
no
time
but
at
least
one
need
wear
much
cool
loose
things
and
it
does
matter
what
one
does
or
says
peter
laughed
who
was
with
you
when
you
tried
the
experiment
he
demanded
julie
threw
her
head
back
and
even
the
professional
four
glanced
up
and
looked
at
her
ah
would
you
like
to
know
she
laughed
well
i
wo
tease
you
two
native
girls
if
you
want
to
know
that
was
all
the
rest
of
the
party
were
having
a
midday
sleep
but
i
never
can
sleep
at
midday
i
do
mind
lying
in
a
hammock
or
a
and
reading
but
i
ca
sleep
one
feels
so
beastly
when
one
wakes
up
does
one
peter
nodded
but
steered
her
back
tell
me
more
he
said
you
wake
something
up
in
me
i
feel
as
if
i
was
born
to
be
there
well
she
said
reflectively
i
do
know
that
anything
can
beat
the
great
range
that
runs
along
our
border
in
natal
it
different
of
course
but
it
very
wonderful
there
one
pass
i
know
see
here
you
go
up
a
wide
valley
with
a
stream
that
runs
in
and
out
and
that
you
have
to
cross
again
and
again
until
it
narrows
and
narrows
to
a
small
footpath
between
great
kranzes
at
first
there
are
queer
stunted
trees
and
bushes
about
with
the
stream
that
now
a
tiny
thing
of
clear
water
singing
among
them
and
there
the
trees
stop
and
you
climb
up
and
up
among
the
boulders
until
you
think
you
can
do
no
more
and
at
the
last
you
come
out
on
the
top
and
then
you
in
wonderland
before
you
lies
peak
on
peak
and
rocky
so
clear
in
the
rare
still
air
there
is
nothing
there
but
mountain
and
rock
and
grass
and
the
blue
sky
with
perhaps
little
clouds
being
blown
across
it
and
a
wind
that
cool
and
vast
you
feel
it
fills
everything
and
you
look
down
the
way
you
come
and
there
all
natal
spread
out
at
your
feet
like
a
tiny
picture
lands
and
woods
and
rivers
till
it
lost
in
the
mist
of
the
distance
she
ceased
staring
at
her
at
last
the
chatter
of
the
place
broke
in
on
peter
my
dear
he
exclaimed
one
can
see
it
but
what
do
you
do
there
she
laughed
and
broke
the
spell
what
would
one
do
she
demanded
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
and
make
love
peter
if
there
anybody
to
make
love
to
but
you
could
do
that
all
your
life
he
objected
why
not
why
do
anything
else
i
never
can
see
and
when
tired
for
you
get
tired
at
last
back
to
durban
for
a
or
back
farther
still
to
london
or
paris
for
a
bit
that
the
life
for
me
peter
he
smiled
provided
somebody
is
there
with
the
necessary
i
suppose
he
said
solomon
she
mocked
solomon
solomon
why
do
you
spoil
it
all
but
you
right
of
course
peter
though
i
hate
to
think
of
that
i
see
how
we
like
and
how
we
unlike
julie
said
peter
suddenly
you
like
real
things
and
so
do
i
you
hate
to
feel
stuffy
and
tied
up
in
conventions
and
so
do
i
but
you
content
with
just
that
and
not
am
i
she
queried
looking
at
him
a
little
strangely
peter
did
not
notice
he
was
bent
on
pursuing
his
argument
yes
you
are
he
said
when
you
in
the
grip
of
real
vital
things
nature
naked
and
unashamed
you
have
all
you
want
you
do
stop
to
think
of
you
live
but
i
i
feel
that
there
is
something
round
the
corner
all
the
time
i
feel
as
if
there
must
be
something
bigger
than
just
that
i
love
your
forest
and
your
range
and
your
natives
i
think
but
only
because
one
is
nearer
something
else
with
them
than
here
i
do
know
how
to
put
it
but
when
you
think
of
those
things
you
feel
and
i
still
feel
peter
said
julie
softly
do
you
remember
caudebec
he
looked
up
at
her
then
i
shall
never
forget
it
dear
he
said
then
you
remember
our
talk
in
the
car
he
nodded
when
you
talked
about
marriage
and
human
nature
and
men
and
so
on
he
said
no
i
do
mean
that
i
did
talk
of
those
things
and
i
gave
you
a
little
rather
bitter
philosophy
that
is
more
true
than
you
think
but
i
do
mean
that
afterwards
when
we
spoke
about
shams
and
playing
do
you
remember
i
hinted
that
a
big
thing
might
come
along
do
you
remember
he
nodded
again
but
he
did
not
speak
well
she
said
it
come
that
all
another
bottle
of
chianti
sir
queried
the
padrone
at
his
elbow
peter
started
what
oh
yes
please
he
said
we
can
manage
another
bottle
julie
and
bring
on
the
dessert
now
will
you
julie
have
a
cigarette
if
we
have
another
bottle
you
must
drink
most
of
it
she
laughed
almost
as
if
they
had
not
been
interrupted
but
with
a
little
vivid
colour
in
her
cheeks
otherwise
my
dear
you
have
to
carry
me
upstairs
which
wo
look
any
too
well
but
i
want
another
glass
oh
peter
do
look
at
that
woman
now
peter
looked
the
elderly
officer
had
dined
to
repletion
and
drank
well
too
the
woman
had
roused
herself
she
was
plainly
urging
him
to
come
on
out
and
as
peter
glanced
over
she
made
an
all
but
imperceptible
sign
to
a
waiter
who
bustled
forward
with
the
man
cap
and
stick
he
took
them
stupidly
and
the
woman
helped
him
up
but
not
too
noticeably
together
they
made
for
the
door
which
the
waiter
held
wide
open
the
woman
tipped
him
and
he
bowed
the
door
closed
and
the
pair
disappeared
into
the
street
a
damned
plucky
sort
said
julie
i
do
care
what
anyone
says
i
did
think
so
once
julie
said
peter
but
i
believe
you
right
now
it
a
world
little
girl
and
one
never
knows
where
one
is
in
it
men
often
do
said
julie
but
women
make
fewer
mistakes
come
peter
let
get
back
i
want
the
walk
and
i
want
that
cosy
little
room
he
drained
his
glass
and
got
up
suddenly
the
thought
of
the
physical
julie
ran
through
him
like
fire
rather
he
said
gaily
so
do
i
little
girl
the
waiter
pulled
back
the
chairs
the
padrone
came
up
all
bows
and
smiles
he
hoped
the
captain
would
come
again
any
time
it
was
better
to
ring
up
as
they
were
often
very
full
a
taxi
no
well
the
walk
through
the
streets
was
enjoyable
after
dinner
even
now
when
the
lights
were
so
few
madame
he
hoped
everything
had
been
to
her
liking
julie
sauntered
across
the
now
little
room
and
took
arm
in
the
street
do
you
know
the
way
she
demanded
we
ca
miss
it
he
said
up
here
will
lead
us
to
shaftesbury
avenue
somewhere
and
then
we
go
down
sure
you
want
to
walk
darling
yes
and
see
the
people
peter
i
love
seeing
them
somehow
by
night
they
more
natural
than
they
are
by
day
i
hate
seeing
people
going
to
work
in
droves
and
men
rushing
about
the
city
with
dollars
written
all
across
their
faces
at
night
that
mostly
finished
with
one
can
see
ugly
things
but
some
rather
beautiful
ones
as
well
let
cross
over
there
are
more
people
that
side
they
passed
together
down
the
big
street
even
the
theatres
were
darkened
to
some
extent
but
taxis
were
about
and
kept
depositing
their
loads
of
men
and
smiling
women
the
held
tommies
often
plainly
with
a
from
down
east
men
who
sauntered
along
and
scanned
the
faces
of
the
women
a
newsboy
or
two
a
few
loungers
waiting
to
pick
up
odd
coppers
and
here
and
there
a
woman
by
herself
it
was
the
usual
crowd
but
they
were
in
the
mood
to
see
the
unusual
in
usual
things
in
the
circus
they
lingered
a
little
shrouded
as
it
was
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
hung
over
everything
little
groups
that
talked
for
a
while
at
the
corners
or
made
appointments
or
met
and
broke
up
again
had
the
air
of
conspirators
in
some
great
affair
the
rush
of
cars
down
regent
street
and
then
this
way
and
that
lent
colour
to
the
thought
and
it
affected
both
of
them
what
brooding
over
it
all
julie
peter
ca
you
feel
that
there
is
something
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
then
gave
a
little
shiver
love
or
what
men
take
for
love
she
said
he
clasped
the
hand
that
lay
along
his
arm
passionately
come
along
he
said
oh
this
good
peter
said
julie
a
few
minutes
later
she
had
thrown
off
her
wrap
and
was
standing
by
the
fire
while
he
arranged
the
cigarettes
the
biscuits
and
a
couple
of
drinks
on
the
little
table
with
its
shaded
light
did
you
lock
the
door
are
we
quite
alone
we
two
at
last
with
all
the
world
shut
out
he
came
swiftly
over
to
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
for
answer
he
pressed
kisses
on
her
hair
her
lips
her
neck
and
she
responded
to
them
oh
love
love
he
said
let
sit
down
and
forget
that
there
is
anything
but
you
and
i
she
broke
from
him
with
a
little
laugh
of
excitement
we
will
peter
she
said
but
i
going
to
take
off
this
dress
and
one
or
two
other
things
and
let
my
hair
down
then
i
come
back
take
them
off
here
he
said
you
need
go
away
she
looked
at
him
and
laughed
again
help
me
then
she
said
and
turned
her
back
for
him
to
loosen
her
dress
clumsily
he
obeyed
he
helped
her
off
with
the
shimmering
beautiful
thing
and
put
it
carefully
over
a
chair
with
deft
fingers
she
loosened
her
hair
and
he
ran
his
fingers
through
it
and
buried
his
face
in
the
thick
growth
of
it
she
untied
a
ribbon
at
her
waist
and
threw
from
her
one
or
two
of
her
mysterious
woman
things
then
with
a
sigh
of
utter
abandonment
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
they
sat
long
over
the
fire
outside
the
dull
roar
of
the
sleepless
city
came
faintly
up
to
them
and
now
and
again
a
coal
fell
in
the
grate
at
long
last
peter
pushed
her
back
a
little
from
him
little
girl
he
said
i
must
ask
one
thing
will
you
forgive
me
that
night
at
abbeville
after
we
left
langton
what
was
it
you
would
tell
me
what
was
it
you
thought
he
would
have
known
about
you
but
not
i
julie
i
thought
was
it
anything
to
do
with
east
africa
those
tropical
nights
under
the
moon
oh
tell
me
julie
the
girl
raised
her
eyes
to
his
that
look
of
pain
and
knowledge
that
he
had
seen
from
the
beginning
was
in
them
again
her
hand
clasped
the
lappet
of
his
tunic
convulsively
and
she
seemed
to
him
indeed
but
a
little
girl
peter
could
you
not
have
asked
but
no
you
could
not
you
but
you
guess
now
do
you
oh
peter
i
was
so
young
and
i
thought
oh
i
thought
the
big
thing
had
come
and
since
then
life
been
all
one
big
mockery
i
laughed
at
it
peter
it
was
the
only
way
and
then
you
came
along
i
have
dared
to
think
but
there
something
about
you
oh
i
do
know
what
but
you
do
play
tricks
do
you
peter
and
you
given
me
all
at
last
without
a
question
oh
peter
tell
me
you
love
me
still
it
your
love
peter
that
can
make
me
clean
and
save
my
soul
if
i
any
soul
to
save
she
added
brokenly
peter
caught
her
to
him
he
crushed
her
so
that
she
caught
her
breath
with
the
pain
of
it
and
he
wound
his
hand
all
but
savagely
in
her
hair
he
got
up
and
she
never
guessed
he
had
the
strength
and
carried
her
out
in
his
arms
and
into
the
other
room
and
hours
later
staring
into
the
blackness
while
she
slept
as
softly
as
a
child
by
his
side
he
could
not
help
smiling
a
little
to
himself
it
was
all
so
different
from
what
he
had
imagined
chapter
viii
peter
awoke
and
wondered
where
he
was
then
his
eye
fell
on
a
unfamiliar
trunk
across
the
room
and
he
heard
splashing
through
the
open
door
of
the
bathroom
julie
he
called
a
gurgle
of
laughter
came
from
the
same
direction
and
the
splashing
ceased
almost
the
next
second
julie
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
was
still
from
the
water
and
her
sole
dress
was
a
rosebud
which
she
had
just
tucked
into
her
hair
she
stood
there
laughing
a
perfect
vision
of
unblushing
natural
loveliness
splendidly
made
from
her
little
head
poised
lightly
on
her
white
shoulders
to
her
slim
feet
you
lazy
creature
she
exclaimed
you
awake
at
last
are
you
get
up
at
once
and
she
ran
over
to
him
just
as
she
was
seizing
the
and
attempting
to
strip
them
off
peter
protested
vehemently
you
a
shameless
baggage
he
said
and
i
do
want
to
get
up
yet
i
want
some
tea
and
a
cigarette
in
bed
go
away
you
wo
get
up
wo
you
she
said
all
right
i
get
into
bed
then
and
she
made
as
if
to
do
so
get
away
he
shouted
you
streaming
wet
you
soak
everything
i
do
care
she
retorted
laughing
and
struggling
at
the
same
time
and
she
succeeded
in
getting
a
foot
between
the
sheets
peter
slipped
out
on
the
other
side
and
she
ran
round
to
him
come
on
she
said
now
for
your
bath
not
another
moment
my
water
steaming
hot
and
quite
good
enough
for
you
you
can
smoke
in
your
bath
or
after
it
come
on
she
dragged
him
into
the
bathroom
and
into
that
bath
and
then
she
filled
a
sponge
with
cold
water
and
trickled
it
on
him
until
he
threatened
to
jump
out
and
give
her
a
cold
douche
then
panting
with
her
exertions
and
dry
now
she
collapsed
on
the
chair
and
began
to
fumble
with
her
hair
and
its
solitary
rose
it
was
exactly
julie
who
sat
there
unashamed
in
her
nakedness
peter
thought
she
had
kept
the
soul
of
a
child
through
everything
and
it
could
burst
through
the
outer
covering
of
the
woman
who
had
tasted
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
laugh
in
the
sun
peter
she
said
would
you
love
to
live
in
the
fiji
no
not
the
fiji
because
i
expect
that
civilised
these
days
but
on
an
almost
desert
island
though
not
desert
of
course
why
does
one
call
robinson
crusoe
sort
of
islands
oh
i
know
because
it
means
deserted
i
suppose
but
i
do
want
it
quite
deserted
for
i
want
you
and
three
or
four
huts
of
nice
savages
to
cut
up
wood
for
the
fire
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
should
wear
a
rose
no
a
hibiscus
in
my
hair
all
day
long
and
nothing
else
at
all
and
you
should
wear
well
i
do
know
what
you
should
wear
but
something
picturesque
that
covered
you
up
a
bit
because
you
by
no
means
so
as
i
am
peter
she
jumped
up
and
stretched
out
her
arms
am
i
not
peter
why
is
there
a
good
mirror
in
this
horrid
old
bathroom
it
more
necessary
in
a
bathroom
than
anywhere
i
think
well
i
can
see
you
without
it
said
peter
and
i
quite
agree
julie
you
divine
you
are
like
aphrodite
sprung
from
the
foam
she
laughed
well
spring
from
the
foam
yourself
old
dear
and
come
and
dress
i
getting
cold
i
going
to
put
on
the
most
thrilling
set
of
undies
this
morning
that
you
ever
saw
the
peter
put
his
fingers
in
his
ears
julie
he
said
in
one
minute
i
shall
blush
for
shame
go
and
put
on
something
if
you
must
but
talk
about
it
you
like
a
greek
goddess
just
now
but
if
you
begin
to
quote
advertisements
you
be
like
well
i
do
know
what
you
be
like
but
i
wo
have
it
anyway
go
on
get
away
with
you
i
shall
throw
the
sponge
at
you
if
you
do
she
departed
merrily
singing
to
herself
and
peter
lay
a
little
longer
in
the
soft
warm
water
he
dwelt
lovingly
on
the
girl
in
the
other
room
he
told
himself
he
was
the
happiest
man
alive
and
yet
he
got
out
of
the
bath
without
apparent
rhyme
or
reason
with
a
little
sigh
but
he
was
only
a
little
quicker
than
most
men
in
that
julie
had
attained
and
was
radiant
peter
had
attained
and
sighed
she
was
entirely
respectable
by
contrast
when
he
rejoined
her
shaven
and
a
little
later
but
just
as
delectable
as
she
stood
in
soft
white
things
putting
up
her
hair
with
her
bare
arms
he
went
over
and
kissed
her
you
never
said
at
all
you
wretch
he
said
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
again
many
times
purposely
she
said
i
shall
never
say
to
you
while
you
horribly
unshaven
never
you
ca
help
waking
up
like
it
i
know
but
it
your
duty
to
get
clean
and
decent
as
quickly
as
possible
see
i
try
to
remember
said
peter
and
stressed
the
word
she
held
him
for
an
appreciable
second
at
that
then
loosed
him
with
a
quick
movement
go
now
she
said
and
order
breakfast
to
be
brought
up
to
our
it
must
be
a
very
nice
breakfast
there
must
be
kippers
and
an
omelette
go
quick
i
be
ready
in
half
a
minute
i
believe
that
girl
is
sweeping
the
room
said
peter
am
i
to
appear
like
this
you
must
remember
that
we
not
in
france
put
on
a
then
you
have
got
one
here
then
put
on
my
kimono
you
look
exceedingly
beautiful
really
peter
you
do
our
island
will
have
to
be
japan
because
kimonos
suit
you
but
i
shall
never
live
to
reach
it
if
you
do
order
that
breakfast
peter
departed
and
had
a
satisfactory
interview
with
the
telephone
in
the
presence
of
the
maid
he
returned
with
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
smiling
and
julie
turned
to
survey
him
peter
come
here
have
you
kissed
that
girl
i
believe
you
have
how
dare
you
talk
about
being
shameless
with
me
here
in
the
next
room
i
thought
you
never
minded
such
things
julie
you
told
me
to
kiss
girls
before
now
you
said
that
you
always
allow
your
husband
complete
liberty
now
did
you
julie
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
heaved
a
mock
sigh
what
incredible
creatures
are
men
she
exclaimed
must
i
mean
everything
i
say
solomon
is
there
no
difference
between
this
flat
and
that
miserable
old
hotel
in
caudebec
and
last
but
not
least
have
you
promised
to
forsake
all
other
and
cleave
unto
me
as
long
as
we
both
shall
live
if
you
had
promised
it
i
know
you
could
possibly
keep
it
but
as
it
is
i
have
hopes
this
was
too
much
for
peter
he
dropped
into
the
position
that
she
had
grown
to
love
to
see
him
in
and
he
put
his
arms
round
her
waist
looking
up
at
her
laughingly
but
you
will
marry
me
julie
wo
you
he
demanded
before
his
eyes
a
lingering
trace
of
that
old
look
crept
back
into
her
face
she
put
her
hands
beneath
his
chin
and
said
no
word
till
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
julie
julie
my
darling
he
said
you
must
must
peter
she
queried
a
little
wistfully
he
thought
yes
must
but
say
you
want
to
say
you
will
julie
i
want
to
peter
she
said
oh
my
dear
you
do
know
you
know
how
much
the
form
is
nothing
to
me
but
i
want
if
i
can
keep
you
if
you
can
keep
me
echoed
peter
and
it
was
as
if
an
finger
had
suddenly
been
laid
on
his
heart
for
one
second
he
saw
what
might
be
but
he
banished
it
what
he
exclaimed
can
not
you
trust
me
julie
do
you
know
i
love
you
do
you
know
i
want
to
make
you
the
very
centre
of
my
being
julie
i
know
dearest
she
whispered
and
he
had
never
heard
her
speak
so
before
you
want
that
is
one
thing
you
can
that
is
another
peter
stared
up
at
her
he
felt
like
a
little
child
who
kneels
at
the
feet
of
a
mother
whom
it
sees
as
infinitely
loving
infinitely
wise
infinitely
old
and
like
a
child
he
buried
his
head
in
her
lap
oh
julie
he
said
you
must
marry
me
i
want
you
so
that
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
i
do
know
what
you
mean
say
he
said
looking
up
again
and
clasping
her
tightly
say
you
marry
me
julie
she
sprang
up
with
a
laugh
peter
she
said
you
you
are
actually
proposing
to
me
upon
your
knees
if
i
could
curtsy
or
faint
i
would
but
i
ca
every
scrap
of
me
is
modern
down
to
that
you
would
let
me
talk
about
let
go
and
eat
kippers
i
dying
for
them
come
on
old
solomon
he
got
up
more
slowly
for
who
could
resist
julie
in
that
mood
but
he
made
one
more
effort
he
caught
her
hand
but
just
say
julie
he
said
just
she
snatched
her
hand
away
maybe
i
will
tell
you
on
monday
morning
she
said
and
ran
out
of
the
room
as
he
finished
dressing
he
heard
her
singing
in
the
next
room
and
then
talking
to
the
maid
when
he
entered
the
the
girl
came
out
and
he
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
he
went
in
and
looked
sharply
at
julie
there
was
a
suspicion
of
moisture
in
hers
also
oh
peter
she
said
and
took
him
by
the
arm
as
the
door
closed
why
you
tell
me
about
jack
i
going
out
immediately
after
breakfast
to
buy
her
the
best
silver
i
can
find
see
and
now
come
and
eat
your
kippers
they
i
expect
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
so
began
a
day
to
peter
julie
was
the
centre
of
it
he
followed
her
into
shops
and
paid
for
her
purchases
and
carried
her
parcels
he
climbed
with
her
on
to
buses
which
she
said
she
preferred
to
taxis
in
the
he
listened
to
her
talk
and
he
did
his
best
to
find
out
what
she
wanted
and
get
just
that
for
her
they
lunched
at
her
request
at
an
sober
restaurant
in
regent
street
that
gave
one
the
impression
of
eating
luncheon
in
a
georgian
in
some
private
house
of
great
stolidity
and
decorum
when
julie
had
said
that
she
wanted
such
a
place
peter
had
been
tickled
to
think
how
she
would
behave
in
it
but
she
speedily
enlightened
him
she
drew
off
her
gloves
with
an
air
she
did
not
laugh
once
she
did
not
chat
to
the
waiter
she
did
not
hurry
in
nor
demand
the
nor
call
him
solomon
she
did
not
commit
one
single
colonial
solecism
at
table
as
peter
had
hated
himself
for
half
thinking
that
she
might
yet
she
never
had
looked
prettier
he
thought
and
even
there
he
caught
glances
which
suggested
that
others
might
think
so
too
and
if
she
talked
less
than
usual
so
did
he
for
his
mind
was
very
busy
in
the
old
days
it
was
almost
just
such
a
wife
as
julie
now
that
he
would
have
wanted
but
did
he
want
the
old
days
could
he
go
back
to
them
could
he
don
the
clerical
frock
coat
and
with
it
the
clerical
system
and
outlook
of
john
he
knew
as
he
sat
there
that
not
only
he
could
not
but
that
he
would
not
what
then
it
was
almost
as
if
julie
suggested
that
the
alternative
was
madcap
days
such
as
that
little
scene
in
the
bathroom
suggested
he
looked
at
her
and
thought
of
it
again
and
smiled
at
the
incongruity
of
it
there
but
even
as
he
smiled
the
cold
whisper
of
dread
insinuated
itself
again
small
and
slight
as
it
was
would
such
days
fill
his
life
could
they
offer
that
which
should
seize
on
his
heart
and
hold
it
he
roused
himself
with
an
effort
of
will
poured
himself
another
glass
of
wine
and
drank
it
down
the
generous
stuff
warmed
him
and
he
glanced
at
his
i
say
he
said
we
shall
be
late
julie
and
i
do
want
to
miss
one
scrap
of
this
show
have
you
finished
a
little
more
wine
julie
was
watching
him
he
thought
as
he
spoke
and
she
too
seemed
to
him
to
make
a
little
effort
i
will
peter
she
said
not
at
all
as
she
had
spoken
there
before
a
full
glass
too
one
wants
to
be
in
a
good
mood
for
the
coliseum
well
dear
old
thing
cheerio
outside
he
demanded
a
taxi
i
must
have
it
julie
he
said
i
want
to
drive
up
and
have
the
old
buffer
in
gold
braid
open
the
door
for
me
have
a
cigarette
she
took
one
and
laughed
as
they
settled
into
the
car
i
know
the
feeling
my
dear
she
said
and
you
want
to
stroll
languidly
up
the
red
carpet
and
pass
by
the
pictures
of
as
if
you
were
so
accustomed
to
the
real
thing
that
really
the
pictures
were
rather
borin
do
you
know
and
you
want
to
make
eyes
at
the
and
give
a
tip
when
they
open
the
box
and
take
off
your
british
warm
in
full
view
of
the
audience
and
kiss
you
said
peter
uproariously
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
good
lord
julie
you
a
marvel
no
more
of
those
old
restaurants
for
me
we
dine
at
our
hotel
in
the
big
public
room
near
the
band
and
we
drink
champagne
and
you
put
the
cork
in
my
stocking
she
queried
stretching
out
her
foot
he
pushed
his
hand
up
her
skirt
and
down
to
the
warm
place
beneath
the
gay
garter
that
she
indicated
and
he
kissed
her
passionately
again
it
does
matter
now
he
said
i
have
more
of
you
than
that
why
nothing
to
me
now
julie
oh
how
i
love
you
she
pushed
him
off
and
snatched
her
foot
away
also
laughing
gaily
getting
cheap
am
i
she
said
we
see
you
going
to
have
a
damned
rotten
time
in
the
theatre
my
dear
not
another
kiss
and
i
shall
be
as
prim
as
a
quaker
the
car
stopped
you
could
he
laughed
helping
her
out
and
what
is
more
i
sha
let
you
be
i
got
you
old
darling
and
i
propose
to
keep
you
what
more
he
took
her
arm
resolutely
come
along
going
to
be
confoundedly
late
theirs
was
a
snug
little
box
one
of
the
new
ones
placed
as
in
a
french
theatre
the
great
place
was
nearly
dark
as
they
entered
except
for
the
blaze
of
light
that
shone
through
the
curtain
the
odour
of
and
scent
greeted
them
with
the
rustle
of
dresses
and
the
subdued
sound
of
gay
talk
the
band
struck
up
then
after
the
rolling
overture
the
curtain
ran
swiftly
up
and
a
smart
young
person
tripped
on
the
stage
in
the
limelight
and
made
great
play
of
swinging
petticoats
julie
had
no
remembrance
of
her
promised
severity
at
any
rate
she
hummed
airs
and
sang
choruses
and
laughed
and
was
thrilled
exactly
as
she
should
have
been
while
the
music
and
the
panorama
went
on
and
wrapped
them
round
with
glamour
as
it
was
meant
to
do
she
cheered
the
patriotic
pictures
and
peter
with
her
till
he
felt
no
end
of
a
fellow
to
be
in
uniform
the
people
in
front
of
them
glanced
round
amusedly
now
and
again
and
as
like
as
not
julie
would
be
discovered
sitting
there
demurely
her
child
face
all
innocence
and
a
big
chocolate
held
between
her
fingers
at
her
mouth
peter
would
lean
back
in
his
corner
convulsed
at
her
and
without
moving
a
muscle
of
her
face
she
would
put
her
leg
tip
on
his
seat
and
push
him
one
scene
they
watched
well
back
in
their
dark
box
his
arm
round
her
waist
it
was
a
little
pathetic
and
well
done
and
in
the
gloom
he
played
with
the
curls
at
her
ears
and
neck
with
his
lips
and
held
her
hand
when
it
was
over
they
went
out
with
the
crowd
the
january
day
was
done
but
it
was
bewildering
for
all
that
to
come
out
into
real
life
there
was
no
romance
for
the
moment
on
the
stained
street
and
in
the
passing
traffic
the
gold
braid
of
the
hall
commissionaire
looked
tawdry
and
the
pictures
of
but
vulgar
it
is
the
common
experience
but
each
time
one
feels
it
there
is
a
new
surprise
julie
had
her
own
remedy
the
liveliest
you
can
find
peter
she
demanded
it
will
be
hard
to
beat
our
own
said
peter
well
away
there
then
let
get
back
to
a
band
again
anyhow
the
great
was
full
of
people
and
for
a
few
minutes
it
did
not
seem
as
if
they
would
find
seats
but
then
julie
espied
a
table
and
they
made
for
it
it
stood
away
back
in
a
corner
with
two
wicker
armchairs
before
it
and
behind
a
stationary
lounge
against
the
wall
overhung
by
a
huge
palm
the
lounge
was
occupied
we
get
in
there
presently
whispered
peter
and
they
took
the
chairs
thankful
in
the
crowded
place
to
get
seated
at
all
oh
it
was
topping
peter
said
julie
i
love
a
great
place
like
that
i
almost
wish
we
had
had
seats
or
stalls
out
amongst
the
people
but
i
do
know
that
box
was
delicious
did
you
see
how
that
old
fossil
in
front
kept
looking
round
i
made
eyes
at
him
once
deliberately
you
know
like
this
and
she
looked
sideways
at
peter
with
subtle
invitation
just
hinted
in
her
eyes
i
thought
he
would
have
apoplexy
i
did
really
it
a
good
thing
i
did
notice
julie
even
now
i
should
hate
to
see
you
look
like
that
say
at
donovan
you
do
it
too
well
oh
here
the
tea
praise
the
lord
i
dying
for
a
cup
you
can
have
all
the
cakes
i
smoked
too
much
would
you
prefer
a
whisky
no
not
now
afterwards
what
that
they
playing
they
listened
julie
seemingly
intent
and
peter
who
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
to
recognise
the
piece
glanced
sideways
at
the
couple
on
the
lounge
they
did
not
notice
him
he
took
them
both
in
and
caught
he
could
not
help
it
a
few
words
she
was
he
guessed
slightly
but
handsome
and
full
figured
a
woman
of
whom
any
man
might
have
been
proud
he
was
an
officer
in
major
uniform
and
he
was
smoking
a
cigarette
impatiently
and
staring
down
the
lounge
she
on
the
other
hand
had
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
as
if
to
read
every
expression
on
his
face
which
was
heavy
and
sullen
and
mutinous
is
that
final
then
george
she
said
i
tell
you
i
ca
help
it
i
promised
i
dine
with
carstairs
a
look
swept
across
her
face
peter
could
not
altogether
read
it
it
was
not
merely
anger
or
pique
or
disappointment
it
certainly
was
not
merely
grief
there
was
all
that
in
it
but
there
was
more
and
she
said
he
only
just
caught
the
sentence
of
any
of
their
words
but
there
was
the
world
of
bitter
meaning
in
it
quite
alone
i
suppose
and
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
me
to
sit
up
peter
said
julie
suddenly
the
tea
cold
take
me
upstairs
will
you
we
can
have
better
sent
up
he
turned
to
her
in
surprise
and
then
saw
that
she
too
had
heard
and
seen
right
dear
he
said
it
is
beastly
stuff
i
think
after
all
prefer
a
spot
and
i
believe
you
would
too
he
rose
carefully
not
looking
towards
the
lounge
like
a
man
and
julie
got
up
too
glancing
at
that
other
couple
with
such
an
ordinary
merely
interested
look
that
peter
smiled
to
himself
to
see
it
they
threaded
their
way
in
necessary
silence
through
the
tables
and
chairs
to
the
doors
and
said
hardly
a
word
in
the
lift
but
in
their
cosy
as
ever
julie
turned
to
him
in
a
passion
of
emotion
such
as
he
had
scarcely
dreamed
could
exist
even
in
her
oh
you
darling
she
said
pick
me
up
and
sit
me
in
that
chair
on
your
knee
love
me
peter
love
me
as
you
never
loved
me
before
hold
me
tight
tight
peter
hurt
me
kiss
me
love
me
say
you
love
me
and
she
choked
her
own
utterance
and
buried
her
face
on
his
shoulder
straining
her
body
to
his
twining
her
slim
foot
and
leg
round
his
ankle
in
a
moment
she
was
up
again
however
and
glanced
at
the
clock
peter
we
must
dress
early
and
dine
early
must
we
the
thing
begins
at
now
i
know
what
we
do
first
give
me
a
drink
a
long
one
solomon
and
take
one
yourself
thanks
that
do
the
best
oh
that
good
peter
ca
you
feel
it
running
through
you
and
electrifying
you
now
come
she
seized
him
by
the
arm
come
on
i
tell
you
what
you
got
to
do
smiling
though
a
little
astonished
at
this
outburst
peter
allowed
himself
to
be
pulled
into
the
bedroom
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
pushed
out
a
foot
take
it
off
you
darling
while
i
take
down
my
hair
she
said
he
knelt
and
undid
the
laces
and
took
off
the
brown
shoes
one
by
one
feeling
her
little
foot
through
the
silk
as
he
did
so
then
he
looked
up
she
had
pulled
out
a
comb
or
two
and
her
hair
was
hanging
down
with
swift
fingers
she
finished
her
work
and
was
waiting
for
him
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
she
buried
her
face
again
oh
peter
love
me
love
me
undress
me
will
you
i
want
you
to
play
with
me
own
me
peter
see
i
am
yours
yours
peter
all
yours
am
i
worth
having
peter
do
you
want
more
than
me
and
she
flung
herself
back
on
the
bed
in
her
disorder
the
little
ribbons
heaving
at
her
breast
her
eyes
afire
her
cheeks
aflame
well
said
peter
an
hour
or
two
later
we
got
to
get
this
dinner
through
as
quickly
as
we
ever
eaten
anything
you
have
to
digest
like
one
of
your
south
african
ostriches
i
say
he
said
to
the
waitress
in
a
confidential
tone
and
with
a
smile
do
you
think
you
can
get
us
stuff
in
ten
minutes
all
told
we
late
as
it
is
and
we
miss
half
the
theatre
else
it
depends
what
you
order
said
the
girl
rather
sharply
then
after
a
glance
at
them
both
see
if
you
have
what
i
say
i
get
you
through
quick
i
know
what
on
easiest
do
you
mind
the
very
thing
said
peter
and
send
the
over
on
your
way
will
you
how
will
that
do
he
added
to
julie
i
risk
everything
peter
except
your
smiling
at
the
waitress
she
said
but
i
must
have
that
champagne
there
something
about
champagne
that
inspires
confidence
when
a
man
gives
you
the
gold
bottle
you
know
that
he
is
really
serious
or
as
serious
as
he
can
be
which
is
saying
much
for
most
men
and
not
half
a
bottle
i
had
heaps
of
times
at
dinners
it
always
means
indecision
which
is
a
beastly
thing
in
anyone
and
especially
in
a
man
it
insulting
for
one
thing
oh
peter
do
look
at
that
girl
over
there
do
you
suppose
she
has
anything
on
underneath
i
suppose
i
could
ask
her
but
you
might
you
know
if
you
put
on
that
smile
of
yours
do
walk
over
beg
her
pardon
and
say
very
nicely
me
but
i
a
chaplain
and
it
my
business
to
know
these
things
i
see
no
stays
on
but
have
you
a
bathing
costume
julie
do
be
quiet
someone
will
hear
you
you
must
remember
we
in
england
and
that
you
talking
english
i
do
care
a
damn
if
they
do
peter
oh
here
the
champagne
at
any
rate
oh
and
some
soup
well
that
something
i
got
the
fish
coming
said
the
girl
if
you
can
be
ready
at
once
julie
seized
her
spoon
i
suppose
i
must
drink
it
she
said
i
do
see
why
i
should
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
it
might
reflect
on
you
peter
and
you
looking
so
immaculate
by
the
way
never
had
that
manicure
do
send
a
note
for
the
girl
i
hide
in
the
bathroom
i
love
to
hear
you
peter
if
i
only
thought
you
would
do
it
i
like
it
better
than
the
play
what
is
the
play
by
the
way
oh
she
mimicked
in
a
french
accent
well
it
will
be
all
too
sadly
true
if
i
leave
you
to
that
bottle
of
fizz
all
by
yourself
give
me
another
glass
please
what
about
you
demanded
peter
if
you
like
this
now
heaven
knows
what
you
be
by
the
time
you
had
half
of
this
peter
you
an
ignoramus
girls
like
me
never
take
too
much
we
began
early
for
one
thing
and
we
used
to
it
for
another
the
more
a
girl
talks
the
soberer
she
is
she
talks
because
she
thinking
and
because
she
does
want
the
man
to
talk
now
if
you
talked
i
know
what
you
might
not
say
you
probably
be
enormously
sentimental
and
i
hate
sentimental
people
i
do
really
sentiment
is
is
it
i
always
associate
it
with
comedians
on
the
stage
look
over
there
do
you
see
that
girl
in
the
big
droopy
hat
and
the
thin
hands
and
the
boy
one
must
say
i
suppose
he
a
little
fat
and
slightly
bald
and
he
got
three
pips
up
and
has
had
them
for
a
long
time
well
look
at
them
he
searching
her
eyes
he
is
peter
really
that
how
it
done
you
just
watch
and
he
does
know
if
he
eating
or
and
she
hoping
her
hat
is
drooping
just
right
and
that
he
notice
her
ring
is
on
the
wrong
finger
and
how
nice
one
would
look
in
the
right
place
to
do
her
justice
she
thinking
much
about
dinner
either
but
that
sinful
waste
peter
in
the
first
place
and
bad
for
one
tummy
in
the
second
however
sentimental
they
are
and
there
a
fortune
in
it
if
they
could
only
bring
themselves
to
do
just
that
for
fifteen
minutes
at
the
alhambra
every
night
they
be
the
most
popular
turn
in
london
that
all
very
well
said
he
but
if
you
eat
so
fast
and
talk
at
the
same
time
you
pay
for
it
very
much
as
you
think
they
will
have
you
finished
no
i
have
i
want
and
i
shall
sit
here
till
i
get
them
or
till
the
whole
of
london
zigzags
round
me
i
say
said
peter
to
their
waitress
if
you
possibly
can
fetch
us
now
not
too
many
but
quickly
can
you
the
lady
wo
go
without
them
and
something
must
be
done
would
the
management
wait
if
you
telephoned
peter
dear
inquired
julie
sarcastically
just
say
who
you
are
and
they
sure
will
if
the
chorus
only
knew
they
go
on
strike
against
appearing
before
you
came
or
tear
their
tights
or
something
dreadful
like
that
so
that
they
could
come
on
yes
now
i
am
ready
one
wee
last
little
drop
of
the
bubbly
i
see
it
there
and
i
sacrifice
coffee
for
your
sake
give
me
a
cigarette
though
thanks
and
now
my
wrap
she
rose
the
cigarette
in
her
fingers
smiling
at
him
peter
hastily
followed
walking
on
air
he
was
beginning
to
realise
how
often
he
failed
to
understand
julie
and
to
see
how
completely
she
controlled
her
apparently
more
frivolous
moods
but
he
loved
her
in
them
he
little
knew
as
he
followed
her
out
the
tumult
of
thoughts
that
raced
through
that
little
head
with
its
wealth
of
brown
hair
he
little
guessed
how
bravely
she
was
already
counting
the
fleeting
minutes
how
resolutely
keeping
grip
of
herself
in
the
flood
which
threatened
to
sweep
her
how
gladly
away
a
good
revue
must
be
a
pageant
of
music
colour
scenery
song
dance
humour
and
the
impossible
there
must
be
good
songs
in
it
but
one
does
not
go
for
the
songs
any
more
than
one
goes
to
see
the
working
out
of
a
plot
men
hours
out
of
the
trenches
with
every
nerve
on
edge
must
come
away
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
on
their
faces
to
have
a
last
drink
at
home
and
sleep
like
babies
women
who
have
been
on
nervous
tension
for
months
must
be
able
to
go
there
and
allow
their
tired
senses
to
drink
in
the
feast
of
it
all
so
that
they
too
may
go
home
and
sleep
and
in
a
sense
their
evening
meant
all
this
to
peter
and
julie
but
only
in
a
sense
they
both
of
them
bathed
in
the
performance
the
possible
and
impossible
scenes
came
and
went
in
a
bewildering
variety
till
one
had
the
feeling
that
one
was
asleep
and
dreaming
the
incomprehensible
jumble
of
a
dream
and
as
in
a
nice
dream
one
knew
it
was
absurd
but
did
not
care
the
magnificent
brilliant
staging
dazzled
till
one
lay
back
in
one
chair
and
refused
to
name
the
colours
to
oneself
or
admire
their
blending
any
more
the
trooped
on
and
off
till
they
seemed
countless
and
one
abandoned
any
wish
to
pick
the
prettiest
and
follow
her
through
and
the
gay
palace
of
luxury
with
its
hundreds
of
splendidly
dressed
women
its
men
in
uniform
its
height
and
width
and
gold
and
painting
and
its
great
arching
roof
where
high
above
the
stirring
of
human
hearts
still
went
on
took
to
itself
an
atmosphere
and
became
sentient
with
humanity
julie
and
peter
were
both
emotional
and
imaginative
and
they
were
spellbound
till
the
notes
of
the
national
anthem
roused
them
then
with
the
commonplaces
of
departure
they
left
the
place
it
so
near
said
julie
in
the
crowd
outside
let
walk
again
the
other
pavement
then
said
peter
and
they
crossed
it
was
cold
and
julie
clung
to
him
and
they
walked
swiftly
at
the
entrance
peter
suggested
an
hour
under
the
palms
but
julie
pleaded
against
it
why
dear
she
said
it
so
cosy
upstairs
and
we
have
all
we
want
besides
the
lounge
would
be
an
let
go
up
they
went
up
and
julie
dropped
into
her
chair
while
peter
knelt
to
poke
the
fire
then
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
she
refused
one
for
once
and
he
stood
there
looking
into
the
flame
julie
drew
a
deep
sigh
was
it
gorgeous
peter
she
said
i
help
it
but
i
always
feel
i
want
it
to
go
on
for
ever
and
ever
did
you
ever
see
that
was
worse
even
than
this
i
wanted
to
get
up
and
walk
into
the
play
these
modern
things
are
too
clever
you
know
unreal
and
yet
they
seem
to
be
real
you
know
you
dreaming
but
you
hate
to
wake
up
i
could
let
all
that
music
and
dancing
and
colour
go
on
round
me
till
i
floated
away
and
away
for
ever
peter
said
nothing
he
continued
to
stare
into
the
fire
what
do
you
feel
demanded
julie
peter
drew
hard
on
his
cigarette
and
then
he
blew
out
the
smoke
i
do
know
he
said
yes
i
do
he
added
quickly
i
feel
i
want
to
get
up
and
preach
a
sermon
good
lord
peter
what
a
dreadful
sensation
that
must
be
do
begin
now
will
you
i
beginning
to
wish
we
gone
into
the
lounge
after
all
you
surely
could
have
preached
there
peter
did
not
smile
he
went
on
as
if
she
had
not
spoken
or
write
a
great
novel
or
better
still
a
great
play
he
said
what
would
be
the
subject
then
you
solomon
or
the
title
anyway
i
do
know
said
peter
dreamily
men
are
way
of
all
no
neither
of
those
is
good
and
besides
one
at
least
is
taken
i
know
he
added
suddenly
i
would
call
it
all
my
word
julie
i
believe
i
could
do
it
he
straightened
himself
and
walked
across
the
room
and
back
again
once
or
twice
i
believe
i
could
i
feel
it
tingling
in
me
but
it
all
formless
if
you
understand
i
no
plot
it
just
what
i
feel
as
i
sit
there
in
a
theatre
as
we
did
just
now
julie
leaned
forward
and
took
the
cigarette
she
had
just
refused
she
lit
it
herself
with
a
match
and
peter
stood
and
watched
her
but
hardly
saw
what
she
was
doing
she
was
as
conscious
of
his
preoccupation
as
if
it
were
something
physical
about
him
explain
my
dear
she
said
leaning
back
and
staring
into
the
fire
i
do
know
that
i
can
he
replied
and
she
felt
as
if
he
did
not
speak
to
her
it
the
bigness
of
it
all
the
beauty
the
triumphant
success
it
drawn
that
great
house
full
lured
them
in
the
thousands
of
them
and
it
does
so
night
after
night
tired
people
go
there
to
be
refreshed
and
sad
people
to
be
made
gay
and
people
sick
of
life
to
laugh
and
forget
it
it
the
world
big
anodyne
it
offers
a
great
exchange
and
all
for
a
few
shillings
julie
and
for
a
few
hours
the
sensation
lingers
but
one
has
to
go
again
and
again
it
tricks
one
into
thinking
almost
that
it
the
real
thing
that
one
can
dance
like
mayflies
in
the
sun
only
julie
there
comes
an
hour
when
down
sinks
the
sun
and
what
of
the
mayflies
then
julie
shifted
her
head
ever
so
little
go
on
she
said
looking
up
intently
at
him
he
did
not
notice
her
but
her
words
roused
him
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
again
and
her
eyes
followed
him
why
he
said
excitedly
you
see
that
it
a
fraudulent
exchange
it
a
fraudulent
exchange
that
it
offers
and
it
itself
is
an
exchange
as
fraudulent
as
that
which
our
modern
world
is
making
no
not
our
modern
world
only
we
talk
so
big
of
our
modernity
when
it
all
less
than
the
dust
this
year
leaves
no
better
than
last
year
and
fallen
rome
offered
the
same
exchange
and
even
a
better
one
i
think
the
blood
and
lust
and
conflict
of
the
amphitheatre
but
they
both
exchanges
offered
instead
of
the
great
thing
the
only
great
thing
which
is
peter
god
of
course
almighty
god
jesus
if
you
will
but
i
not
in
a
mood
for
the
tenderness
of
that
it
god
himself
who
offers
tired
and
sad
people
and
people
sick
of
life
no
anodyne
no
mere
rest
but
stir
and
fight
and
the
thrill
of
things
nobly
done
nobly
tried
julie
even
if
nobly
failed
ca
you
see
it
and
you
and
i
have
been
looking
at
what
the
world
offers
in
exchange
he
ceased
and
dropped
into
a
chair
the
other
side
of
the
fire
a
silence
fell
on
them
then
julie
gave
a
little
shiver
peter
dear
she
said
tenderly
i
a
little
tired
and
cold
he
was
up
at
once
and
bending
over
her
my
darling
what
a
beast
i
am
i
clean
forgot
you
for
a
minute
what
will
you
have
what
about
a
hot
toddy
shall
i
make
one
he
demanded
smiling
donovan
taught
me
how
and
i
really
rather
good
at
it
she
smiled
back
at
him
and
put
her
hand
up
to
smooth
his
hair
that
would
be
another
exchange
peter
she
said
and
i
do
want
it
only
one
thing
can
warm
me
and
give
me
rest
he
read
what
she
meant
in
her
eyes
and
knelt
beside
the
chair
to
put
his
arms
around
her
she
leaned
her
face
on
his
shoulder
and
returned
the
kisses
that
he
showered
upon
her
poor
mayflies
she
said
to
herself
how
they
love
to
dance
in
the
sun
chapter
ix
ever
after
that
next
day
the
saturday
will
remain
in
peter
memory
as
a
time
by
itself
of
special
significance
but
a
significance
except
for
one
incident
very
hard
to
place
it
began
indeed
very
quietly
and
very
happily
they
breakfasted
again
in
their
own
room
and
julie
was
in
one
of
her
subdued
moods
if
one
ever
could
say
she
was
subdued
afterwards
peter
lit
a
cigarette
and
strolled
over
to
the
window
it
a
beastly
day
he
said
cloudy
cold
windy
and
going
to
rain
i
think
what
shall
we
do
snow
up
in
the
hotel
all
the
time
no
said
julie
emphatically
something
quite
different
you
shall
show
me
some
of
the
real
london
sights
westminster
abbey
to
begin
with
then
we
drive
along
the
embankment
and
you
shall
tell
me
what
everything
is
and
we
go
and
see
anything
else
you
suggest
i
do
suppose
you
realise
peter
that
i
all
but
absolutely
ignorant
of
london
he
turned
and
smiled
on
her
and
you
really
to
see
these
things
he
said
yes
of
course
i
do
you
do
think
i
suggested
it
for
your
benefit
but
if
it
will
make
you
any
happier
i
flatter
you
a
bit
i
want
to
see
those
things
now
with
you
partly
because
i
never
likely
to
find
anyone
who
can
show
me
them
better
now
then
are
you
pleased
at
that
then
they
started
westminster
came
first
and
they
wandered
all
over
it
and
saw
as
much
as
the
conditions
of
war
had
left
for
the
public
to
see
it
amused
peter
to
show
julie
the
things
that
seemed
to
him
to
have
a
particular
interest
the
chapter
house
st
faith
chapel
the
tomb
of
the
confessor
and
so
on
she
made
odd
comments
in
st
faith
she
said
i
do
say
many
prayers
peter
but
here
i
say
one
why
not
he
demanded
because
it
too
private
she
said
quaintly
i
should
think
i
was
pretending
to
be
a
saint
if
i
went
past
everybody
else
and
the
vergers
and
things
into
a
little
place
like
this
all
by
myself
everyone
would
know
that
i
was
doing
something
which
most
people
do
do
see
why
do
people
pray
all
over
the
church
as
they
do
in
france
in
a
cathedral
peter
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
come
on
he
said
your
notions
are
all
julie
come
and
look
at
the
monuments
they
wandered
down
the
transept
and
observed
the
majesty
of
england
in
stone
robed
in
togas
declaiming
to
the
almighty
and
obviously
convinced
that
he
would
be
intensely
interested
or
perhaps
dying
in
the
arms
of
a
female
with
funeral
urns
or
ships
or
cannon
in
the
background
or
at
least
in
one
case
crouching
hopelessly
before
the
dart
of
a
triumphant
death
julie
was
certainly
impressed
they
are
all
like
ancient
romans
peter
she
said
and
much
more
striking
than
those
cardinals
and
bishops
and
kings
kneeling
at
prayer
in
rouen
cathedral
but
still
they
were
ancient
romans
were
they
they
were
all
christians
i
suppose
is
there
a
christian
monument
anywhere
about
i
do
know
said
peter
but
we
walk
round
and
see
they
made
a
lengthy
pilgrimage
and
finally
peter
arrested
her
one
he
said
a
georgian
bishop
in
looked
down
on
them
fat
and
comfortable
in
front
of
him
was
a
monstrous
cup
and
a
plate
piled
with
biggish
squares
of
stone
julie
did
not
realise
what
it
was
what
he
doing
with
all
that
she
demanded
peter
was
really
a
bit
horrified
you
an
appalling
pagan
he
said
come
away
and
they
came
they
roamed
along
the
embankment
julie
was
as
curious
as
a
child
and
wanted
to
know
all
about
everything
from
boadicea
cleopatra
needle
and
the
temple
church
to
dewar
whisky
works
and
the
hotel
cecil
thereabouts
julie
asked
the
name
of
the
squat
tower
and
old
buildings
opposite
and
when
she
heard
it
was
lambeth
palace
instantly
demanded
to
visit
it
peter
was
doubtful
if
they
could
but
they
crossed
to
see
and
they
were
shown
a
good
deal
by
the
courtesy
of
the
authorities
the
archbishop
was
away
to
peter
great
relief
for
as
likely
as
not
julie
would
have
insisted
on
an
introduction
but
they
saw
the
chapel
and
the
amongst
other
things
the
long
line
of
portraits
fascinated
her
but
not
as
it
fascinated
peter
the
significance
of
the
change
in
the
costumes
of
the
portraits
struck
him
for
the
first
time
first
the
cope
and
mitre
and
cross
then
the
and
the
tippet
then
the
and
the
wig
then
the
coat
and
breeches
and
white
cravat
then
the
academic
robes
and
then
a
purple
cassock
its
interest
to
julie
was
other
however
peter
she
whispered
perhaps
you
be
there
one
day
he
looked
at
her
sharply
but
she
was
not
mocking
him
and
marvelling
at
her
simplicity
and
honest
innocence
he
relaxed
into
a
smile
not
very
likely
my
dear
he
said
in
other
days
a
pleasant
underground
cell
in
the
lollards
tower
would
have
been
more
likely
then
of
course
julie
must
see
the
famous
tower
and
see
a
little
of
it
they
did
she
wanted
to
know
what
lollardy
was
their
guide
attempted
an
explanation
julie
was
soon
bored
i
ca
see
why
people
make
such
a
bother
about
such
things
she
said
a
man
religion
is
his
own
business
surely
and
he
must
settle
it
for
himself
do
you
think
so
peter
is
it
his
own
business
only
he
asked
gravely
whose
else
should
it
be
she
demanded
god
said
peter
simply
julie
stared
at
him
and
sighed
you
very
odd
peter
she
said
but
you
do
say
things
that
strike
one
as
being
true
go
on
oh
there
no
more
to
say
said
peter
except
perhaps
this
if
anyone
or
any
church
honestly
believed
that
god
had
committed
his
share
in
the
business
to
them
well
then
he
might
justifiably
feel
that
he
or
it
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
settling
of
another
man
religion
hence
this
tower
julie
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
dear
hence
me
past
and
present
but
come
on
she
took
his
arm
with
a
little
shiver
which
he
was
beginning
to
notice
from
time
to
time
in
her
it
a
horrible
idea
peter
she
said
yes
let
go
so
their
taxi
took
them
to
buckingham
palace
and
thereabouts
and
by
chance
they
saw
the
king
and
queen
their
majesties
drove
by
smartly
in
morning
dress
with
a
couple
of
policemen
ahead
and
a
few
women
waved
handkerchiefs
and
peter
came
to
the
salute
and
julie
cheered
the
queen
turned
towards
where
she
was
standing
and
bowed
and
peter
noticed
amazed
that
the
eyes
of
the
colonial
girl
were
wet
and
that
she
did
not
attempt
to
hide
it
he
had
to
question
her
i
should
have
thought
you
have
felt
about
royalty
like
that
julie
he
said
well
i
do
she
said
and
i
do
care
what
you
say
only
i
wish
they
go
about
with
the
life
guards
the
king
a
king
to
me
i
suppose
he
is
only
a
man
but
i
do
want
to
think
of
him
so
he
stands
for
the
empire
and
for
the
flag
and
he
stands
for
england
too
i
obey
that
man
almost
in
anything
right
or
wrong
but
i
do
know
that
i
obey
anyone
else
then
you
a
survival
of
the
dark
ages
he
said
do
be
a
beast
said
julie
all
right
you
not
and
indeed
i
do
know
if
i
am
right
very
likely
you
the
very
embodiment
of
the
spirit
of
the
present
day
having
lost
every
authority
you
crave
for
one
julie
considered
this
there
may
be
something
in
that
she
said
but
i
do
like
you
when
you
clever
it
was
the
king
and
that
enough
for
me
and
i
do
want
to
see
anything
more
i
hungry
take
me
to
lunch
peter
laughed
that
it
he
said
like
the
follower
of
prince
charlie
who
shook
hands
once
with
his
prince
and
then
vowed
he
would
never
shake
hands
with
anyone
again
so
you
seen
the
king
and
you
wo
see
anything
else
only
your
impression
wo
last
twelve
hours
fortunately
i
do
suppose
the
other
man
kept
his
vow
said
julie
for
one
thing
no
man
ever
does
come
on
and
so
they
drifted
down
the
hours
until
the
evening
theatre
and
they
said
and
did
nothing
in
particular
but
they
just
enjoyed
themselves
in
point
of
fact
they
were
emotionally
tired
and
besides
they
wanted
to
forget
how
the
time
sped
by
the
quiet
day
was
in
its
own
way
too
a
preparation
for
the
evening
feast
and
they
were
both
in
the
mood
to
enjoy
the
piece
intensely
when
it
came
the
magnificence
of
the
new
theatre
in
which
it
was
staged
all
helped
its
wide
easy
stairways
its
many
conveniences
its
stupendous
auditorium
its
packed
house
ushered
it
well
in
even
the
audience
seemed
different
from
that
of
last
night
julie
settled
herself
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
to
listen
and
watch
and
they
both
grew
silent
as
the
opera
proceeded
at
first
julie
could
not
contain
her
delight
oh
she
perfect
peter
she
exclaimed
a
little
bit
of
life
look
how
she
shakes
her
hair
back
and
how
impudent
she
is
just
like
one
of
those
french
girls
you
know
too
much
about
and
she
boiling
passion
too
and
a
regular
devil
i
love
her
peter
she
very
like
you
julie
said
peter
julie
flashed
a
look
at
him
rubbish
she
said
but
was
silent
they
watched
while
carminetta
set
herself
to
win
her
bet
and
steal
the
heart
of
the
hero
from
the
governor
daughter
they
watched
her
force
the
palace
ballroom
and
forgot
the
obvious
foolishness
of
a
great
deal
of
it
in
the
sense
of
the
drama
that
was
being
worked
out
the
whole
house
grew
still
the
english
girl
with
her
beauty
her
civilisation
her
rank
and
place
made
her
appeal
to
her
fiancé
and
the
spanish
bastard
dancer
with
her
daring
her
passion
her
naked
humanity
so
coarse
and
so
intensely
human
made
her
appeal
also
and
they
watched
while
the
young
officer
hesitated
they
watched
till
carminetta
won
julie
leaning
forward
held
her
breath
and
gazed
at
the
beautiful
fashionable
room
on
the
stage
gazed
through
the
open
french
windows
to
the
moonlit
garden
and
the
night
beyond
and
gazed
though
at
last
she
could
hardly
see
at
the
spanish
girl
that
great
renunciation
held
them
both
entranced
so
so
humanly
divine
the
passionate
heroic
song
of
farewell
swelled
and
thrilled
about
them
and
with
the
last
notes
the
child
of
the
gutter
reached
up
and
up
till
she
made
the
supreme
and
stepped
out
of
the
gay
room
into
the
dark
night
for
the
sake
of
the
man
she
loved
too
much
to
love
then
julie
bowed
her
head
into
her
hands
and
in
the
silence
and
darkness
of
their
box
burst
into
tears
and
so
for
the
first
and
last
time
peter
heard
her
really
weep
he
said
foolish
to
comfort
her
she
looked
up
at
last
smiling
her
brown
eyes
challengingly
brave
through
her
tears
peter
forgive
me
she
said
i
should
be
such
a
damned
fool
you
never
thought
i
could
be
like
that
did
you
but
it
was
so
superbly
done
i
could
help
it
it
all
over
now
all
over
peter
she
added
soberly
i
want
to
sit
in
the
lounge
for
a
little
if
you
mind
could
you
possibly
get
a
taxi
i
do
want
to
walk
it
was
difficult
to
find
one
finally
peter
and
another
officer
made
a
bolt
simultaneously
and
each
got
hold
of
a
door
of
a
car
that
was
just
coming
up
both
claimed
it
and
the
chauffeur
looked
round
at
the
disputants
settle
it
way
you
like
gents
he
said
hi
do
care
but
settle
it
soon
let
toss
said
peter
said
the
other
man
and
produced
a
coin
tails
whispered
julie
behind
peter
and
tails
he
called
the
coin
spun
while
the
little
crowd
looked
on
in
amusement
and
tails
it
was
damn
said
the
other
and
turned
away
a
bad
loser
peter
said
julie
and
he
just
been
seeing
too
but
am
i
not
lucky
i
almost
always
win
in
the
palm
lounge
julie
was
very
cheerful
coffee
peter
she
said
and
liqueurs
no
drinks
after
said
the
waiter
sorry
sir
julie
laughed
i
nearly
swore
peter
she
said
but
i
remembered
in
time
if
one
ca
get
what
one
wants
one
has
to
go
without
singing
but
i
have
a
cigarette
not
to
say
two
before
we
finished
and
i
in
no
hurry
i
want
to
sit
on
here
and
pretend
it
not
saturday
night
and
i
want
to
go
very
slowly
to
bed
and
i
do
want
to
sleep
is
that
the
effect
of
the
theatre
asked
peter
and
why
so
different
from
last
night
julie
evaded
do
you
feel
really
different
she
demanded
yes
he
said
how
well
i
do
want
to
preach
any
sermon
it
been
preached
julie
drew
hard
on
her
cigarette
and
blew
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
it
has
peter
she
said
merrily
and
thank
the
lord
i
am
therefore
spared
another
you
very
gay
about
it
now
julie
but
you
were
at
first
that
play
made
me
feel
rather
miserable
too
no
i
think
it
made
me
feel
small
carminetta
was
great
was
she
i
do
know
that
there
is
anything
greater
than
that
sort
of
sacrifice
and
it
far
beyond
me
said
peter
julie
leaned
back
and
hummed
a
bar
or
two
that
peter
recognised
from
the
last
great
song
of
the
dancer
well
my
dear
i
was
sad
was
i
she
said
but
it
over
there
no
use
in
sadness
is
there
peter
did
not
reply
and
started
as
julie
suddenly
laughed
oh
good
lord
peter
she
exclaimed
to
what
you
bringing
me
do
you
know
that
i
about
to
quote
scripture
and
i
shall
if
we
sit
on
here
let
walk
up
regent
street
i
ca
sit
still
come
on
she
jumped
up
just
now
he
said
you
wanted
to
sit
still
for
ages
and
now
you
want
to
walk
what
is
the
matter
with
you
julie
and
what
was
the
text
that
would
be
telling
she
laughed
but
ca
i
do
anything
i
like
peter
she
demanded
ca
i
go
and
get
drunk
if
i
like
peter
or
sit
still
or
dance
down
regent
street
or
send
you
off
to
bed
and
pick
up
a
nice
boy
it
would
be
easy
enough
here
ca
i
peter
her
mood
bewildered
him
and
without
in
the
least
understanding
why
he
resented
her
levity
but
he
tried
to
hide
it
of
course
you
can
he
said
lightly
but
you
do
really
want
to
do
those
things
do
you
especially
the
last
julie
she
stood
there
looking
at
him
and
then
in
a
moment
the
excitement
died
out
of
her
voice
and
eyes
she
dropped
into
a
chair
again
no
peter
she
said
i
do
that
the
marvel
of
it
i
expect
i
shall
one
of
these
days
do
most
of
those
things
and
the
last
as
well
but
i
do
think
i
ever
to
do
them
again
and
that
what
done
to
me
my
dear
peter
was
very
moved
he
slipped
his
hand
out
and
took
hers
under
cover
of
her
dress
my
darling
he
whispered
i
owe
you
everything
you
have
given
me
all
and
i
wo
hold
back
all
from
you
do
you
remember
julie
that
once
i
said
i
thought
i
loved
you
more
than
god
well
i
know
now
oh
yes
i
believe
i
do
know
now
but
i
choose
you
julie
her
eyes
shone
up
at
him
very
brightly
and
he
could
not
read
them
altogether
but
her
lips
whispered
and
he
thought
he
understood
oh
peter
my
dearest
she
said
thank
god
i
have
at
least
heard
you
say
that
i
would
have
missed
you
saying
those
words
for
anything
peter
so
might
the
in
pilate
courtyard
have
been
glad
had
she
been
in
love
chapter
x
part
at
least
of
julie
programme
was
fulfilled
to
the
letter
for
they
lay
long
in
bed
talking
desultory
reminiscent
talk
which
sent
mind
back
over
the
months
and
the
last
few
days
even
after
julie
was
asleep
in
the
bed
next
his
like
a
pageant
he
passed
in
review
scene
after
scene
turning
it
over
and
wondering
at
significances
that
he
had
not
before
imagined
he
recalled
their
first
meeting
that
instantaneous
attraction
and
he
asked
himself
what
had
caused
it
her
spontaneity
freshness
and
utter
lack
of
conventionality
he
supposed
but
that
did
not
seem
to
explain
all
he
wondered
at
the
change
that
had
even
then
come
about
in
himself
that
he
should
have
been
so
entranced
by
her
he
went
over
his
early
hopes
and
fears
he
thought
again
of
conversations
with
langton
and
he
realised
afresh
how
true
it
was
that
the
old
authorities
had
dwindled
away
that
no
allegiance
had
been
left
that
his
had
been
a
citadel
without
a
master
and
then
julie
moved
through
his
days
again
julie
at
caudebec
daring
iconoclastic
free
julie
at
abbeville
mysterious
passionate
dominant
julie
at
dieppe
ah
julie
at
dieppe
he
marvelled
that
he
had
held
out
so
long
after
dieppe
and
then
louise
rose
before
him
he
understood
louise
less
than
julie
perhaps
and
with
all
the
threads
in
his
hand
he
failed
to
see
the
pattern
he
turned
over
restlessly
it
was
easy
to
see
how
they
had
come
to
be
in
london
it
would
have
been
more
remarkable
if
they
had
not
so
come
together
but
now
what
now
he
could
not
sum
up
julie
amid
the
shifting
scenes
of
the
last
few
days
she
had
been
so
loving
and
yet
in
a
way
their
love
had
reached
no
climax
it
had
indeed
reached
what
he
would
once
have
thought
a
complete
and
ultimate
climax
but
plainly
julie
did
not
think
so
and
nor
did
he
now
the
things
of
the
spirit
were
after
all
so
much
greater
than
the
things
of
the
flesh
the
julie
of
friday
night
had
been
his
but
of
this
night
he
rolled
over
again
what
had
she
meant
at
the
play
he
told
himself
her
tears
were
simple
emotion
her
laughter
simple
reaction
but
he
knew
it
was
not
true
and
for
himself
well
julie
was
julie
he
loved
her
intensely
she
could
stir
him
to
anything
almost
he
loved
to
be
with
her
to
see
her
to
hear
her
but
he
did
not
feel
satisfied
he
knew
that
he
told
himself
that
he
was
an
introspective
fool
that
nothing
ever
would
seem
to
satisfy
him
that
the
centre
of
his
life
and
would
be
julie
that
she
was
real
tinglingly
intensely
real
but
he
knew
that
that
was
not
the
last
word
and
then
and
there
he
resolved
that
the
last
word
should
be
spoken
on
the
morrow
that
had
indeed
already
come
by
the
clock
she
should
promise
to
marry
him
he
slept
perhaps
for
an
hour
or
two
but
he
awoke
with
the
dawn
the
grey
light
was
stealing
in
at
the
windows
and
julie
slept
beside
him
in
the
bed
between
he
tried
to
sleep
again
but
could
not
and
on
a
sudden
had
an
idea
he
got
quietly
out
of
bed
what
is
it
peter
said
julie
sleepily
he
went
round
and
leaned
over
her
i
ca
sleep
any
more
dearest
he
said
i
think
i
dress
and
go
for
a
bit
of
a
walk
do
you
mind
be
in
to
breakfast
no
she
said
go
if
you
want
to
you
are
a
restless
old
thing
he
dressed
silently
and
kept
the
bathroom
door
closed
as
he
bathed
and
shaved
she
was
asleep
again
as
he
stole
out
one
arm
flung
loosely
on
the
counterpane
her
hair
untidy
on
the
pillow
he
kissed
a
lock
of
it
and
let
himself
quietly
out
of
their
suite
it
was
still
very
early
and
the
circus
looked
empty
and
strange
he
walked
down
piccadilly
and
wondered
at
the
clean
soft
touch
of
the
dawning
day
and
recalled
another
memorable
sunday
morning
walk
he
passed
very
familiar
places
and
was
conscious
of
feeling
an
exile
an
inevitable
one
but
none
the
less
an
exile
for
all
that
and
so
he
came
into
james
park
still
as
aimlessly
as
he
had
left
the
hotel
before
him
clear
as
a
pointing
finger
in
the
morning
sky
was
the
campanile
of
that
stranger
among
the
great
cathedrals
of
england
it
attracted
him
for
the
first
time
and
he
made
all
but
unconsciously
towards
it
peter
was
not
even
in
the
spiritual
street
that
leads
to
the
gates
of
the
catholic
church
and
it
was
no
incipient
romanism
that
moved
him
he
was
completely
ignorant
of
the
greater
part
of
that
faith
and
still
more
had
no
idea
of
the
gulf
that
separates
it
from
all
other
religions
he
would
have
supposed
if
he
had
stopped
to
think
that
as
with
other
sects
one
considered
its
tenets
made
up
one
mind
as
to
their
truth
or
falsehood
one
by
one
and
if
one
believed
a
sufficient
majority
of
them
joined
the
church
it
was
only
then
the
mood
of
the
moment
and
when
he
found
himself
really
moving
towards
that
he
excused
himself
by
thinking
that
as
he
was
by
his
own
act
exiled
from
more
familiar
temples
he
would
visit
this
that
would
have
about
it
a
suggestion
of
france
he
wondered
if
it
would
be
open
as
he
turned
into
ashley
gardens
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
only
just
after
seven
perhaps
an
early
mass
might
be
beginning
he
went
to
the
central
doors
and
found
them
fast
then
he
saw
little
groups
of
people
and
individuals
like
himself
making
for
the
door
in
the
great
tower
and
these
he
followed
within
he
stood
amazed
for
a
few
minutes
the
vast
soaring
space
so
austere
in
its
bare
brick
gripped
his
imagination
the
white
and
red
and
gold
of
the
painted
christ
that
hung
so
high
and
monstrous
before
the
entrance
to
the
marbles
of
the
sanctuary
almost
troubled
him
it
dominated
everything
so
completely
that
he
felt
he
could
not
escape
it
he
sought
one
of
the
many
chairs
and
knelt
down
a
little
bell
tinkled
peter
glanced
sideways
towards
the
sound
and
saw
that
a
mass
was
in
progress
in
a
of
gleaming
mosaics
and
that
a
soldier
in
uniform
served
hardly
had
he
taken
the
details
in
when
another
bell
claimed
his
attention
it
came
from
across
the
wide
nave
and
he
perceived
that
another
chapel
had
its
mass
and
a
considerable
congregation
and
then
his
attention
aroused
he
began
to
spy
about
and
to
take
in
the
thing
the
whole
vast
cathedral
was
as
it
were
alive
seven
or
eight
masses
were
in
progress
one
would
scarcely
finish
before
another
priest
preceded
by
soldier
in
uniform
or
server
in
cassock
and
cotta
would
appear
from
beyond
the
great
pulpit
and
make
his
way
to
yet
another
altar
the
small
handbells
rang
out
again
and
again
and
again
and
still
priest
after
priest
was
there
to
take
his
place
peter
began
cautiously
to
move
about
he
became
amazed
at
the
size
of
the
congregation
they
had
been
lost
in
that
great
place
but
every
chapel
had
its
people
and
there
were
in
reality
hundreds
scattered
about
in
the
nave
alone
he
knelt
for
awhile
and
watched
the
giving
of
communion
in
the
guarded
chapel
to
the
north
of
the
high
altar
its
gold
and
emblazoned
gates
were
not
for
him
but
he
could
at
least
kneel
and
watch
those
who
passed
in
and
out
they
were
of
all
sorts
and
classes
of
all
ranks
and
ages
men
women
children
old
and
young
rich
and
poor
soldier
and
civilian
streamed
in
and
out
again
peter
sighed
and
left
them
he
found
an
altar
at
which
mass
was
about
to
begin
and
he
knelt
at
the
back
on
a
mosaic
pavement
in
which
fishes
and
strange
beasts
were
set
in
a
marble
stream
and
watched
and
it
was
not
one
mass
that
he
watched
but
two
or
three
and
it
was
there
that
a
vision
grew
on
his
inner
understanding
as
he
knelt
and
could
not
pray
it
is
hard
and
deceptive
to
write
of
those
subconscious
imaginings
that
convict
the
souls
of
most
men
some
time
or
another
in
that
condition
things
are
largely
what
we
fashion
them
to
be
and
one
may
be
thought
to
be
asserting
their
ultimate
truth
in
speaking
of
their
influence
but
there
is
no
escaping
from
the
fact
that
peter
graham
of
a
lost
allegiance
began
that
sunday
morning
to
be
aware
of
another
claimant
and
this
is
what
dawned
upon
him
and
how
a
french
memory
gave
him
a
here
at
these
low
masses
it
was
more
abundantly
plain
than
ever
that
these
priests
did
not
conceive
themselves
to
be
serving
a
congregation
but
an
altar
one
after
the
other
they
moved
through
a
ritual
and
spoke
low
sentences
that
hardly
reached
him
with
their
eyes
holden
by
that
which
they
did
at
first
he
was
only
conscious
of
this
but
then
he
perceived
the
essential
change
that
came
over
each
in
his
turn
the
posturing
and
speaking
was
but
introductory
to
the
moment
when
they
raised
the
host
and
knelt
before
it
it
was
as
if
they
were
but
functionaries
ushering
in
a
king
and
then
effacing
themselves
before
him
here
then
the
old
testament
of
peter
past
became
to
him
a
schoolmaster
he
heard
himself
repeating
again
the
comfortable
words
of
the
service
come
unto
me
god
so
loved
if
any
man
sin
louise
hot
declaration
forced
itself
upon
him
it
is
he
who
is
there
and
it
was
then
that
the
eyes
of
his
mind
were
enlightened
and
he
saw
a
vision
not
indeed
of
the
truth
of
the
roman
mass
if
it
be
true
and
not
of
the
place
of
the
sacrament
in
the
divine
scheme
of
things
but
the
conception
of
a
love
so
great
that
it
shook
him
as
if
it
were
a
storm
and
bowed
him
before
it
as
if
he
were
a
reed
the
silent
waiting
jesus
all
these
centuries
in
every
land
how
he
had
been
mocked
forgotten
spurned
derided
denied
cast
out
and
still
he
waited
prostitutes
of
the
streets
pardoned
in
a
word
advanced
towards
him
and
he
knew
that
so
shortly
again
within
the
secret
place
of
their
hearts
he
would
be
crucified
but
still
he
waited
careless
men
doubtless
came
up
to
him
and
he
knew
the
sort
that
came
but
still
he
waited
he
peter
who
had
not
known
he
was
here
at
all
and
who
had
gone
wandering
off
in
search
of
any
mistress
spent
many
days
turned
in
by
chance
and
found
him
here
what
did
he
wait
for
nothing
there
was
nothing
that
anyone
could
give
nothing
but
a
load
of
shame
the
offering
of
a
body
spent
by
passionate
days
the
kiss
of
but
still
he
waited
he
did
more
than
wait
he
offered
himself
to
it
all
he
had
bound
himself
by
an
oath
to
be
kissed
if
judas
planned
to
kiss
him
and
he
came
through
the
trees
to
that
bridal
with
the
dawn
of
every
day
he
had
foreseen
the
chalice
foreseen
that
it
would
be
filled
at
every
moon
and
every
sun
by
the
bitter
gall
of
ingratitude
and
wantonness
and
hate
but
he
had
pledged
himself
even
so
father
and
he
was
here
to
drink
it
small
wonder
then
that
the
paving
on
which
peter
graham
knelt
seemed
to
swim
before
his
eyes
until
it
was
in
truth
a
moving
ocean
of
love
that
streamed
from
the
altar
and
enclosed
of
every
kind
and
even
him
the
movement
of
chairs
and
the
gathering
of
a
bigger
congregation
than
usual
near
a
chapel
that
peter
perceived
to
be
for
the
dead
aroused
him
he
got
up
to
go
he
walked
quickly
up
victoria
street
and
marvelled
over
the
scene
he
had
left
in
sight
of
big
ben
he
glanced
up
twenty
to
nine
he
had
been
then
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
cathedral
he
recalled
having
read
that
a
mass
took
half
an
hour
and
he
began
to
reckon
how
many
persons
had
heard
mass
even
while
he
had
been
there
not
less
than
five
hundred
at
every
and
most
probably
more
fifteen
hundred
to
two
thousand
souls
of
every
sort
and
kind
then
had
been
drawn
in
to
that
all
but
silent
ceremony
to
that
showing
of
jesus
crucified
a
multitude
and
what
compassion
thus
he
walked
home
thinking
of
many
things
but
the
vision
he
had
seen
was
uppermost
and
would
not
be
displaced
it
was
still
in
his
eyes
as
he
entered
their
bedroom
and
found
julie
looking
at
a
magazine
as
she
lay
in
bed
smoking
a
cigarette
lor
peter
are
you
back
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
up
but
i
was
so
sleepy
what
the
time
why
what
the
matter
where
have
you
been
peter
did
not
go
over
to
her
at
once
as
she
had
expected
it
was
not
that
he
felt
he
could
not
or
anything
like
that
but
simply
that
he
was
only
thinking
of
her
in
a
secondary
way
he
walked
to
the
and
lifted
the
flowers
she
had
worn
the
night
before
and
put
there
in
a
little
glass
where
have
you
been
old
solomon
demanded
julie
again
seeing
wonders
julie
said
peter
looking
dreamily
at
the
blossoms
no
really
what
do
tell
me
if
it
was
anything
i
might
have
seen
you
were
a
beast
not
to
come
back
for
me
hear
peter
turned
and
stared
at
her
but
she
knew
as
he
looked
that
he
hardly
saw
her
her
tone
changed
and
she
made
a
little
movement
with
her
hand
tell
me
peter
she
said
again
i
seen
said
peter
slowly
a
bigger
thing
than
i
thought
the
world
could
hold
i
seen
something
so
wonderful
julie
that
it
hurt
oh
more
than
i
can
say
i
seen
love
julie
she
could
not
help
it
it
was
a
foolish
thing
to
say
just
then
she
knew
but
it
came
out
oh
peter
she
said
did
you
have
to
leave
me
to
see
that
leave
you
he
questioned
and
for
a
moment
so
lost
in
his
thought
was
he
that
he
did
not
understand
what
she
meant
then
it
dawned
on
him
and
he
smiled
he
did
not
see
as
he
stood
there
the
clumsy
peter
how
the
two
were
related
so
he
smiled
and
he
came
over
to
her
and
took
her
hand
and
sat
on
the
bed
his
eyes
still
full
of
light
oh
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
said
it
far
bigger
than
you
or
i
julie
our
love
is
like
a
candle
held
up
to
the
sun
beside
it
our
love
wants
something
does
it
it
burns
it
it
intoxicates
julie
but
this
love
waits
do
you
understand
it
asks
nothing
it
gives
it
suffices
all
year
after
year
it
just
waits
julie
waits
for
anyone
waits
for
everyone
and
you
can
spurn
it
spit
on
it
crucify
it
and
it
is
still
there
when
you
need
julie
and
peter
leaned
forward
and
buried
his
face
in
her
little
hand
julie
heard
him
through
and
it
was
well
that
before
the
end
he
did
not
see
her
eyes
then
she
moved
her
other
hand
which
held
the
cigarette
and
dropped
the
smoking
end
so
that
it
made
a
little
hiss
into
her
teacup
on
the
table
and
brought
her
hand
back
and
caressed
his
hair
as
he
lay
bent
forward
there
dear
old
peter
she
said
tenderly
how
he
thinks
things
and
when
you
saw
this
this
love
peter
how
did
you
feel
he
did
not
answer
for
a
minute
and
when
he
did
he
did
not
raise
his
head
oh
i
do
know
julie
he
said
it
went
through
and
through
me
it
was
like
a
big
sea
and
it
flooded
me
away
it
filled
me
i
seemed
to
drink
it
in
at
every
pore
i
felt
satisfied
just
to
be
there
and
then
you
came
back
to
julie
eh
peter
she
questioned
why
of
course
he
said
sitting
up
with
a
smile
why
not
he
gave
a
little
laugh
why
julie
he
said
i
never
thought
of
that
before
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
been
oh
i
do
know
but
our
days
together
did
seem
to
make
any
difference
that
love
was
too
big
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
too
big
to
be
well
jealous
i
suppose
she
nodded
that
would
be
just
it
peter
that
how
it
would
seem
to
you
you
see
i
know
it
strange
my
dear
but
i
do
feel
either
jealous
he
frowned
what
do
you
mean
he
said
do
you
understand
it
was
god
love
that
i
saw
she
hesitated
a
second
and
then
her
face
relaxed
into
a
smile
as
blind
as
a
bat
my
dear
but
i
suppose
all
men
are
and
so
you
help
it
now
go
and
ring
for
breakfast
and
smoke
a
cigarette
in
the
while
i
dress
and
peter
because
he
hated
to
be
called
a
bat
and
did
not
feel
in
the
least
like
one
went
he
rang
the
bell
and
the
maid
answered
it
she
did
not
wait
for
him
to
give
his
order
but
advanced
towards
him
her
eyes
sparkling
oh
sir
she
said
is
madame
up
i
do
know
how
to
thank
her
and
you
too
wanted
a
frame
for

but
i
could
get
a
real
good
one
i
could

i
sees

could
think

i
forgot

as
how

real
good

but

me
table
and
if

can
do
for
you
or
your
lady
now
or
ever

do
it
sir
peter
smiled
at
the
little
outburst
but
his
heart
warmed
within
him
how
just
like
julie
it
was
well
he
said
it

lady

expect

you

then

and
he
turned
away
she
made
for
the
door
but
stopped
i
near

sir
she
said
a
gentleman

this
for
you
last
night
and
they
give
it
to
me
at
the
office
this
morning
there
was
no
answer
he
said
he
went
by
this
morning
train
she
handed
peter
an
unstamped
envelope
bearing
the
hotel
name
and
left
the
room
as
he
opened
it
he
did
not
recognise
the
handwriting
but
he
tore
it
open
and
glanced
at
once
at
the
signature
and
got
a
very
considerable
surprise
not
to
say
a
shock
it
was
signed
jack
donovan
my
dear
graham
the
letter
ran

it
up
i
know
you
congratulate
me
she
topping
and
just
the
girl
for
me
no
end
wiser
than
i
and
as
jolly
as
anyone
really
i
do
know
how
you
and
julie
are
coming
out
of
it
and
i
wo
guess
for
it
a
dreadful
war
but
maybe
you
be
able
to
sympathise
with
me
at
having
to
leave
girl
in
france
however
i
off
back
a
day
before
you
if
you
had
run
off
to
paris
you
have
known
my
leave
order
was
from
havre
well
cheerio
see
you
before
long
and
just
one
word
my
boy
from
a
fellow
who
has
seen
a
bit
more
than
you
if
you
forgive
me
remember
know
yours
ever
jack
donovan
peter
frowned
over
his
letter
and
then
smiled
and
then
frowned
again
he
was
still
at
it
when
he
heard
julie
footstep
outside
and
he
thrust
the
envelope
quickly
into
his
pocket
thinking
rapidly
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
what
the
other
meant
especially
by
the
last
sentence
and
he
wanted
to
consider
it
before
showing
julie
also
he
wondered
if
it
was
meant
to
be
shown
to
julie
at
all
he
thought
not
probably
donovan
was
absolutely
as
good
as
his
word
and
would
not
even
mention
anything
to
tommy
but
he
thought
no
more
for
julie
was
on
him
peter
it
started
to
rain
i
knew
it
would
why
does
it
always
rain
on
sundays
in
london
probably
the
heavens
themselves
weep
at
the
sight
of
so
gloomy
a
city
however
i
do
care
a
damn
i
made
up
my
mind
what
we
going
to
do
we
shall
sit
in
front
of
the
fire
all
the
morning
and
you
shall
read
to
me
will
you
anything
you
like
my
darling
he
said
and
we
could
spend
a
better
morning
but
bacon
and
eggs
first
eh
no
fish
first
i
mean
but
pour
out
a
cup
of
tea
at
once
for
heaven
sake
have
had
a
drop
this
morning
poor
old
thing
no
wonder
you
a
bit
off
colour
no
early
tea
after
that
champagne
last
night
but
oh
peter
was
a
dream
breakfast
over
peter
sat
in
a
chair
and
bent
over
her
what
do
you
want
me
to
read
julie
darling
he
demanded
she
considered
a
magazine
la
vie
though
we
might
perhaps
look
at
the
pictures
part
of
the
time
i
know
stop
get
it
she
ran
out
and
returned
with
a
little
book
read
it
right
through
peter
she
said
i
read
it
heaps
of
times
but
i
want
to
hear
it
again
do
you
mind
omar
khayyám
exclaimed
peter
good
idea
he
a
blasphemous
old
pagan
but
the
verse
is
glorious
and
it
fits
in
at
times
do
you
want
me
to
start
at
once
give
me
a
cigarette
no
put
the
box
there
stir
up
the
fire
come
and
sit
on
the
floor
with
your
back
to
me
that
right
now
fire
away
she
leaned
back
and
he
began
he
read
for
the
rhythm
she
listened
for
the
meaning
he
read
to
the
end
she
hardly
heard
more
than
a
stanza
oh
threats
of
hell
and
hopes
of
paradise
one
thing
at
least
is
certain
life
flies
one
thing
is
certain
and
the
rest
is
lies
the
flower
that
once
has
blown
for
ever
dies
they
lunched
in
the
hotel
and
at
the
table
peter
put
the
first
necessary
questions
that
they
both
dreaded
i
going
to
tell
them
to
make
out
my
bill
julie
he
said
i
to
be
at
victoria
at
you
know
you
still
got
some
leave
have
you
dear
what
are
you
going
to
do
how
long
will
you
stay
on
here
not
after
you
gone
peter
she
said
let
them
make
it
out
for
me
till
after
breakfast
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
he
demanded
oh
do
ask
it
spoils
to
think
of
go
to
my
friends
perhaps
yes
i
think
that
it
only
for
a
few
days
now
oh
julie
i
wish
i
could
stay
so
do
i
but
you
ca
so
do
worry
what
about
this
afternoon
if
it
stopped
raining
let
go
for
a
walk
shall
we
they
settled
on
that
and
it
was
julie
who
took
him
again
to
park
as
they
walked
where
did
you
go
to
church
this
morning
peter
she
asked
he
pointed
to
the
campanile
over
there
he
said
then
let
go
together
she
said
do
you
mean
it
julie
of
course
i
do
i
curious
besides
it
sunday
and
i
want
to
go
to
church
but
you
miss
dinner
objected
peter
it
begins
at
well
let
get
some
food
out
victoria
station
for
instance
that
do
we
can
have
some
supper
sent
up
afterwards
in
the
hotel
peter
agreed
but
they
did
not
go
to
the
station
in
a
little
cafe
outside
julie
saw
a
south
african
private
eating
eggs
and
bacon
and
nothing
would
do
but
that
they
must
do
the
same
so
they
went
in
they
ate
off
thick
plates
and
julie
dropped
the
china
on
her
eggs
and
generally
behaved
as
if
she
were
at
a
but
it
was
a
novelty
and
it
kept
their
thoughts
off
the
fact
that
it
was
the
last
night
and
finally
they
went
to
church
the
service
did
not
impress
peter
and
every
time
he
looked
at
face
he
wanted
to
laugh
but
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
did
though
he
could
not
catch
the
impression
of
the
morning
for
the
sermon
a
stoutish
ecclesiastic
mounted
the
pulpit
and
they
both
prepared
to
be
bored
however
he
gave
out
his
text
and
peter
sat
bolt
upright
at
once
it
would
have
delighted
the
ears
of
his
wesleyan
corporal
of
the
forestry
and
more
than
that
it
was
the
text
he
had
quoted
in
the
ears
of
the
dying
jenks
he
prepared
keenly
to
listen
as
for
julie
she
was
regarding
the
altar
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
and
she
scarcely
moved
the
whole
time
outside
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
crowd
peter
began
at
once
julie
he
said
whatever
did
you
think
of
that
sermon
what
did
you
she
said
tell
me
first
i
do
believe
you
listened
at
all
but
i
ca
help
talking
of
it
it
was
amazing
he
began
by
speaking
about
adam
and
eve
and
original
sin
and
the
garden
of
eden
as
if
he
been
there
there
might
never
have
been
a
higher
critic
in
existence
then
he
said
what
sin
did
and
that
sin
was
only
truly
sin
if
it
did
do
that
was
to
hide
the
face
of
god
to
put
him
and
a
human
being
absolutely
out
of
communication
so
to
speak
and
then
he
came
to
christ
to
the
cross
did
you
hear
him
julie
christ
comes
in
between
he
got
in
between
god
and
man
all
the
anger
that
darted
out
of
god
against
sin
hit
him
all
the
blows
that
man
struck
back
against
god
hit
him
do
you
see
that
julie
that
was
wonderfully
put
but
the
end
was
more
wonderful
both
ultimately
can
not
kill
the
heart
of
jesus
there
no
sin
there
to
merit
or
to
feel
the
anger
and
we
can
hurt
but
we
ca
destroy
his
love
peter
stopped
that
what
i
saw
a
little
this
morning
he
said
after
a
minute
well
said
julie
oh
it
all
so
plain
if
there
was
a
way
to
that
heart
one
would
be
safe
i
mean
a
way
that
is
not
an
emotional
idea
not
a
subjective
experience
but
something
practical
some
way
that
a
tommy
could
travel
as
easily
as
anyone
and
get
to
a
real
thing
and
he
said
there
was
a
way
and
just
sketched
it
the
sacraments
more
than
ours
of
course
their
seven
all
of
them
more
or
less
i
suppose
he
meant
that
the
sacraments
were
not
signs
of
salvation
but
salvation
itself
julie
i
never
saw
the
idea
before
it
colossal
it
a
thing
to
which
one
might
dedicate
one
life
it
a
thing
to
live
and
die
gladly
for
it
fills
one
do
you
think
so
julie
he
spoke
exultantly
peter
to
be
honest
said
julie
i
think
you
talking
fanatical
rubbish
do
you
really
julie
you
ca
you
ca
but
i
do
peter
she
said
sadly
it
makes
no
appeal
to
me
i
can
only
see
one
great
thing
in
life
and
it
not
that
rest
is
lies
but
oh
surely
that
great
thing
might
not
be
false
too
but
why
do
you
see
one
thing
and
i
another
my
dear
i
do
know
said
peter
unless
well
perhaps
it
a
kind
of
gift
julie
thou
knewest
the
gift
of
god
not
that
i
know
only
i
can
just
see
a
great
wonderful
vision
and
it
fills
my
sight
i
too
she
said
but
it
not
your
vision
what
is
it
then
said
he
carried
away
by
his
own
ideas
and
hardly
thinking
of
her
her
voice
brought
him
back
oh
peter
do
you
know
even
yet
he
took
her
arm
very
tenderly
at
that
my
darling
he
said
the
two
are
incompatible
julie
do
be
sad
i
love
you
you
know
i
love
you
i
wish
we
never
gone
to
the
place
if
you
think
i
do
but
i
have
changed
towards
you
a
bit
julie
i
love
you
far
far
more
than
anyone
else
i
wo
give
you
up
even
to
god
it
was
dark
where
they
were
julie
lifted
her
face
to
him
just
there
he
thought
he
had
never
heard
her
speak
as
she
spoke
now
there
in
a
london
street
under
the
night
sky
peter
my
darling
she
said
my
brave
boy
how
i
love
you
peter
i
know
wo
give
me
up
peter
and
i
adore
you
for
it
peter
hell
will
be
heaven
with
the
memory
of
that
there
then
he
sealed
her
with
his
kiss
julie
stirred
in
his
arms
but
the
movement
did
not
wake
him
any
more
than
the
knock
of
the
door
had
done
all
right
she
called
thank
you
and
leaning
over
she
switched
on
the
light
it
was
and
necessary
in
its
radiance
she
bent
over
him
and
none
of
her
friends
had
ever
seen
her
look
as
she
did
then
she
kissed
him
and
he
opened
his
eyes
five
peter
she
said
as
gaily
as
she
could
you
got
to
get
a
move
on
my
dear
two
hours
to
dress
and
pack
and
breakfast
no
i
suppose
you
can
do
that
on
the
train
but
you
got
to
get
there
oh
lord
how
it
brings
the
war
home
does
it
jump
up
peter
sighed
blast
the
war
he
said
lazily
i
sha
move
kiss
me
again
you
darling
and
let
your
hair
fall
over
my
face
she
did
so
and
its
glossy
curtain
hid
them
beneath
the
veil
she
whispered
come
darling
for
my
sake
the
longer
you
stay
here
now
the
harder
it
will
be
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
and
then
jumped
out
of
bed
yawning
that
it
she
said
now
go
and
shave
and
bath
while
i
pack
for
you
hurry
up
then
we
get
more
time
while
he
splashed
about
she
sought
for
his
things
and
packed
for
him
as
she
never
packed
for
herself
as
she
gathered
them
she
thought
of
the
night
before
when
overwhelmed
in
a
tempest
of
love
it
had
all
been
left
for
the
morning
she
filled
the
but
she
could
not
fasten
it
come
and
help
peter
she
called
he
came
out
she
was
kneeling
on
it
in
her
loose
kimono
her
hair
all
about
her
her
nightdress
open
at
the
throat
he
drank
her
beauty
in
and
then
mastered
himself
for
a
minute
and
shut
the
case
that
all
she
queried
yes
he
said
you
get
back
into
bed
my
darling
or
you
catch
cold
i
be
ready
in
a
second
and
then
we
can
have
a
few
minutes
together
at
the
glass
he
marshalled
his
arguments
and
then
he
came
over
to
her
he
dropped
by
the
bedside
and
wound
his
arms
about
her
julie
he
whispered
my
darling
say
you
marry
me
please
she
made
no
reply
he
kissed
her
unresisting
again
and
again
julie
he
said
you
know
how
i
love
you
you
do
know
it
you
know
i
not
begging
you
to
marry
me
because
i
got
something
out
of
you
perhaps
when
you
were
carried
away
and
now
i
feel
i
must
make
reparation
my
darling
it
is
that
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
live
without
you
i
give
up
everything
for
you
i
want
to
start
a
new
life
with
you
i
ca
go
back
to
the
old
anyhow
i
do
want
to
a
sham
to
me

and
i
hate
shams

i
do
but

sham
our
love

a
sham
i
die
for
you
julie
my
own
julie
i
die
for
the
least
little
bit
of
this
hair
of
yours
i
think
but
i
want
to
live
for
you
i
want
to
put
you
right
in
the
centre
of
everything
and
live
for
you
julie
say
my
love
my
own
you
must
say
why

julie
and
still
she
made
no
reply
a
kind
of
despair
seized
him
oh
julie
he
cried
what
can
i
say
or
what
can
i
do
you
cruel
julie
you
killing
me
you
say
before

my
answer
now

peter
said
julie
slowly
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
hardly
dare
speak
lest
my
love
should
carry
me
away
but
listen
my
dear

peter
i
watched
you
these
days
i
watched
you
in
france

watched
you
from
the
moment
when
i
called
you
over
to
me
because
i
was
interested
and
felt
my
fate
i
suppose
i
watched
you
struggling
along
peter
and
i
understand
why
you
struggled
you
built
for
great
things
my
dear
how
great
i
ca

peter
that

he
gave
a
little
cry
but
swiftly
she
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
she
smiled
at
him
as
she
did
so
a
daring
little
smile
be
quiet
you
solomon

she
said

your
only
ultimate
happiness
peter
and
sacrifice
my
all
he
tried
to
speak
but
he
could
not
the
past
days
lay
before
him
in
a
clear
light
at
last
her
love
shone
on
them
and
shone
too
plainly
for
mistake
he
tried
to
deny
but
he
could
contradict
but
his
heart
cried
the
truth
and
his
eyes
could
not
hide
it
but
he
could
and
did
vent
his
passion
damn
god
curse
him
he
cried
i
hate
him
why
should
he
master
me
i
want
you
julie
i
will
have
you
i
will
worship
julie
she
let
him
speak
and
being
julie
his
words
only
brought
a
more
tender
light
into
her
face
peter
she
said
one
minute
do
you
remember
where
you
first
kissed
me
my
darling
the
first
real
kiss
i
mean
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
fun
even
then
you
know
ah
i
see
you
do
you
will
never
forget
that
will
you
perhaps
you
thought
i
did
notice
but
i
did
neither
you
nor
i
chose
it
it
was
fate
perhaps
it
was
your
god
peter
but
anyway
look
at
me
now
as
you
looked
then
what
do
you
see
he
stared
at
her
and
he
saw
how
clearly
he
saw
her
sweet
head
her
shining
eyes
the
falling
on
her
hair
out
of
the
night
he
even
heard
the
sea
as
it
beat
on
the
stones
of
the
quay
or
thought
he
did
and
felt
the
whip
of
the
wind
and
behind
her
dominating
arms
outspread
the
harbour
crucifix
and
she
saw
that
he
saw
and
she
whispered
you
hate
him
peter
and
he
sank
his
head
into
her
hands
and
sobbed
great
dry
sobs
ah
do
do
he
heard
her
say
do
peter
it
not
so
bad
as
that
your
life
is
going
to
be
full
my
beloved
with
a
great
and
burning
love
and
you
were
right
this
morning
peter
more
right
than
you
knew
when
that
is
there
you
will
have
place
even
for
me
yes
even
for
me
the
love
of
what
you
will
call
your
sin
and
i
my
dear
dear
boy
i
have
something
even
now
which
no
devil
peter
and
no
god
can
take
away
he
looked
up
then
there
a
chance
julie
you
wo
say
but
do
say
let
us
see
i
shall
take
no
vows
julie
i
have
an
idea
what
i
shall
do
and
maybe
it
wo
be
quite
as
you
think
and
there
will
be
a
little
room
for
you
one
day
oh
say
you
wait
a
while
julie
just
to
see
it
was
the
supreme
moment
she
saw
no
crucifix
to
sustain
her
but
she
did
see
the
bastard
spanish
and
she
did
not
hesitate
no
peter
she
said
i
would
not
take
that
and
you
never
could
give
it
i
did
not
mean
such
place
as
that
it
never
can
be
peter
you
are
not
made
for
me
and
thus
did
julie
who
knew
no
god
but
julie
of
the
brave
clean
steadfast
heart
give
peter
to
him
the
maid
came
in
answer
to
her
ring
will
you
light
a
fire

julie
i

graham

julie
and
she
never
spoke
more
bravely
but
it
got
to
be
has
it
would
you
pull
the
blind
up
ah
thanks
why
it
sunny
so
glad
it
will
be
good
for
the
crossing
it
will
be
that
we
gets
the
sun
first
up
here
shall
i
bring
up
the
tea
madame
i
ring
said
julie
when
i
want
it
it
wo
be
for
a
few
minutes
yet
the
girl
went
out
and
the
door
shut
behind
her
julie
lay
on
still
for
a
little
and
then
she
got
up
she
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
and
she
threw
her
arms
wide
with
a
gesture
and
shut
her
eyes
and
let
the
sun
fall
on
her
then
she
walked
to
her
little
trunk
and
rummaged
in
it
from
somewhere
far
down
she
drew
out
a
leather
case
and
with
it
in
her
hand
she
went
over
and
sat
by
the
fire
she
held
it
without
moving
for
a
minute
and
then
she
slowly
opened
it
one
by
one
she
drew
out
a
few
worthless
things
a
withered
bunch
of
primroses
a
couple
of
little
scribbled
notes
a
paper
cap
from
a
cracker
a
menu
card
a
handkerchief
of
her
own
that
she
had
lent
to
him
and
that
he
just
like
peter
had
given
back
she
held
them
all
in
her
hand
a
minute
and
then
she
bent
forward
and
dropped
them
in
the
open
fire
and
the
sun
rose
a
little
higher
and
fell
on
the
tumbled
brown
hair
that
peter
had
kissed
and
that
now
hid
her
eyes
