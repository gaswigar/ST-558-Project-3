the
first
lesson
the
one
the
yogi
philosophy
may
be
divided
into
several
great
branches
or
fields
what
is
known
as
hatha
yoga
deals
with
the
physical
body
and
its
control
its
welfare
its
health
its
preservation
its
laws
etc
what
is
known
as
raja
yoga
deals
with
the
mind
its
control
its
development
its
unfoldment
etc
what
is
known
as
bhakti
yoga
deals
with
the
love
of
the
absolute
god
what
is
known
as
gnani
yoga
deals
with
the
scientific
and
intellectual
knowing
of
the
great
questions
regarding
life
and
what
lies
back
of
life
the
riddle
of
the
universe
each
branch
of
yoga
is
but
a
path
leading
toward
the
one
end
unfoldment
development
and
growth
he
who
wishes
first
to
develop
control
and
strengthen
his
physical
body
so
as
to
render
it
a
fit
instrument
of
the
higher
self
follows
the
path
of
hatha
yoga
he
who
would
develop
his
and
mental
faculties
unfolding
the
inner
senses
and
latent
powers
follows
the
path
of
raja
yoga
he
who
wishes
to
develop
by
knowing
by
studying
the
fundamental
principles
and
the
wonderful
truths
underlying
life
follows
the
path
of
gnani
yoga
and
he
who
wishes
to
grow
into
a
union
with
the
one
life
by
the
influence
of
love
he
follows
the
path
of
bhakti
yoga
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
student
must
ally
himself
to
only
a
single
one
of
these
paths
to
power
in
fact
very
few
do
the
majority
prefer
to
gain
a
rounded
knowledge
and
acquaint
themselves
with
the
principles
of
the
several
branches
learning
something
of
each
giving
preference
of
course
to
those
branches
that
appeal
to
them
more
strongly
this
attraction
being
the
indication
of
or
requirement
and
therefore
being
the
hand
pointing
out
the
path
it
is
well
for
every
one
to
know
something
of
hatha
yoga
in
order
that
the
body
may
be
purified
strengthened
and
kept
in
health
in
order
to
become
a
more
fitting
instrument
of
the
higher
self
it
is
well
that
each
one
should
know
something
of
raja
yoga
that
he
may
understand
the
training
and
control
of
the
mind
and
the
use
of
the
will
it
is
well
that
every
one
should
learn
the
wisdom
of
gnani
yoga
that
he
may
realize
the
wonderful
truths
underlying
life
the
science
of
being
and
most
assuredly
every
one
should
know
something
of
bhakti
yogi
that
he
may
understand
the
great
teachings
regarding
the
love
underlying
all
life
we
have
written
a
work
on
hatha
yoga
and
a
course
on
raja
yoga
which
is
now
in
book
form
we
have
told
you
something
regarding
gnani
yoga
in
our
fourteen
lessons
and
also
in
our
advanced
course
we
have
written
something
regarding
bhakti
yoga
in
our
advanced
course
and
we
hope
have
taught
it
also
all
through
our
other
lessons
for
we
fail
to
see
how
one
can
teach
or
study
any
of
the
branches
of
yoga
without
being
filled
with
a
sense
of
love
and
union
with
the
source
of
all
life
to
know
the
giver
of
life
is
to
love
him
and
the
more
we
know
of
him
the
more
love
will
we
manifest
in
this
course
of
lessons
of
which
this
is
the
first
we
shall
take
up
the
subject
of
gnani
yoga
the
yoga
of
wisdom
and
will
endeavor
to
make
plain
some
of
its
most
important
and
highest
teachings
and
we
trust
that
in
so
doing
we
shall
be
able
to
awaken
in
you
a
still
higher
realization
of
your
relationship
with
the
one
and
a
corresponding
love
for
that
in
which
you
live
and
move
and
have
your
being
we
ask
for
your
loving
sympathy
and
cooperation
in
our
task
let
us
begin
by
a
consideration
of
what
has
been
called
the
questions
of
questions
the
question
what
is
reality
to
understand
the
question
we
have
but
to
take
a
look
around
us
and
view
the
visible
world
we
see
great
masses
of
something
that
science
has
called
matter
we
see
in
operation
a
wonderful
something
called
force
or
energy
in
its
countless
forms
of
manifestations
we
see
things
that
we
call
forms
of
life
varying
in
manifestation
from
the
tiny
speck
of
slime
that
we
call
the
moneron
up
to
that
form
that
we
call
man
but
study
this
world
of
manifestations
by
means
of
science
and
research
and
such
study
is
of
greatest
value
still
we
must
find
ourselves
brought
to
a
point
where
we
can
not
progress
further
matter
melts
into
mystery
force
resolves
itself
into
something
else
the
secret
of
subtly
elude
us
and
mind
is
seen
as
but
the
manifestation
of
something
even
finer
but
in
losing
these
things
of
appearance
and
manifestation
we
find
ourselves
brought
up
face
to
face
with
a
something
else
that
we
see
must
underlie
all
these
varying
forms
shapes
and
manifestations
and
that
something
else
we
call
reality
because
it
is
real
permanent
enduring
and
although
men
may
differ
dispute
wrangle
and
quarrel
about
this
reality
still
there
is
one
point
upon
which
they
must
agree
and
that
is
that
is
that
underlying
all
forms
and
manifestations
there
must
be
a
reality
from
which
all
things
flow
and
this
inquiry
into
this
one
reality
is
indeed
the
question
of
questions
of
the
universe
the
highest
reason
of
man
as
well
as
his
deepest
intuition
has
always
recognized
that
this
reality
or
underlying
being
must
be
but
one
of
which
all
nature
is
but
varying
degrees
of
manifestation
emanation
or
expression
all
have
recognized
that
life
is
a
stream
flowing
from
one
great
fount
the
nature
and
name
of
which
is
unknown
some
have
said
unknowable
differ
as
men
do
about
theories
regarding
the
nature
of
this
one
they
all
agree
that
it
can
be
but
one
it
is
only
when
men
begin
to
name
and
analyze
this
one
that
confusion
results
let
us
see
what
men
have
thought
and
said
about
this
one
it
help
us
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
problem
the
materialist
claims
that
this
one
is
a
something
called
matter
eternal
infinite
containing
within
itself
the
potentiality
of
matter
energy
and
mind
another
school
closely
allied
to
the
materialists
claim
that
this
one
is
a
something
called
energy
of
which
matter
and
mind
are
but
modes
of
motion
the
idealists
claim
that
the
one
is
a
something
called
mind
and
that
matter
and
force
are
but
ideas
in
that
one
mind
theologians
claim
that
this
one
is
a
something
called
a
personal
god
to
whom
they
attribute
certain
qualities
characteristics
the
same
varying
with
their
creeds
and
dogmas
the
naturistic
school
claims
that
this
one
is
a
something
called
nature
which
is
constantly
manifesting
itself
in
countless
forms
the
occultists
in
their
varying
schools
oriental
and
occidental
have
taught
that
the
one
was
a
being
whose
life
constituted
the
life
of
all
living
forms
all
philosophies
all
science
all
religions
inform
us
that
this
world
of
shapes
forms
and
names
is
but
a
phenomenal
or
shadow
world
a
back
of
which
rests
reality
called
by
some
name
of
the
teacher
but
remember
this
philosophy
that
is
based
upon
some
form
of
monism
oneness
whether
the
concept
be
a
known
or
unknown
god
an
unknown
or
unknowable
principle
a
substance
an
energy
or
spirit
there
is
but
one
there
can
be
but
one
such
is
the
inevitable
conclusion
of
the
highest
human
reason
intuition
or
faith
and
likewise
the
same
reason
informs
us
that
this
one
life
must
permeate
all
apparent
forms
of
life
and
that
all
apparent
material
forms
forces
energies
and
principles
must
be
emanations
from
that
one
and
consequently
of
it
it
may
be
objected
to
that
the
creeds
teaching
a
personal
god
do
not
so
hold
for
they
teach
that
their
god
is
the
creator
of
the
universe
which
he
has
set
aside
from
himself
as
a
workman
sets
aside
his
workmanship
but
this
objection
avails
naught
for
where
could
such
a
creator
obtain
the
material
for
his
universe
except
from
himself
and
where
the
energy
except
from
the
same
source
and
where
the
life
unless
from
his
one
life
so
in
the
end
it
is
seen
that
there
must
be
but
one
not
two
even
if
we
prefer
the
terms
god
his
universe
for
even
in
this
case
the
universe
must
have
proceeded
from
god
and
can
only
live
and
move
and
act
and
think
by
virtue
of
his
essence
permeating
it
in
passing
by
the
conceptions
of
the
various
thinkers
we
are
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
various
schools
seem
to
manifest
a
in
their
theories
seeing
only
that
which
fits
in
with
their
theories
and
ignoring
the
rest
the
materialist
talks
about
infinite
and
eternal
matter
although
the
latest
scientific
investigations
have
shown
us
matter
fading
into
nothingness
the
eternal
atom
being
split
into
countless
particles
called
corpuscles
or
electrons
which
at
the
last
seem
to
be
nothing
but
a
unit
of
electricity
tied
up
in
a
knot
in
the
ether
although
just
what
the
ether
is
science
does
not
dare
to
guess
and
energy
also
seems
to
be
unthinkable
except
as
operating
through
matter
and
always
seems
to
be
acting
under
the
operation
of
laws
and
laws
without
a
law
giver
and
a
law
giver
without
mind
or
something
higher
than
mind
is
unthinkable
and
mind
as
we
know
it
seems
to
be
bound
up
with
matter
and
energy
in
a
wonderful
combination
and
is
seen
to
be
subject
to
laws
outside
of
itself
and
to
be
varying
inconstant
and
changeable
which
attributes
can
not
be
conceived
of
as
belonging
to
the
absolute
mind
as
we
know
it
as
well
as
matter
and
energy
is
held
by
the
highest
occult
teachers
to
be
but
an
appearance
and
a
relativity
of
something
far
more
fundamental
and
enduring
and
we
are
compelled
to
fall
back
upon
that
old
term
which
wise
men
have
used
in
order
to
describe
that
something
else
that
lies
back
of
and
under
matter
energy
and
mind
and
that
word
is
spirit
we
can
not
tell
just
what
is
meant
by
the
word
spirit
for
we
have
nothing
with
which
to
describe
it
but
we
can
think
of
it
as
meaning
the
essence
of
life
and
being
the
reality
underlying
universal
life
of
course
no
name
can
be
given
to
this
one
that
will
fitly
describe
it
but
we
have
used
the
term
the
absolute
in
our
previous
lessons
and
consider
it
advisable
to
continue
its
use
although
the
student
may
substitute
any
other
name
that
appeals
to
him
more
strongly
we
do
not
use
the
word
god
except
occasionally
in
order
to
bring
out
a
shade
of
meaning
not
because
we
object
to
it
but
because
by
doing
so
we
would
run
the
risk
of
identifying
the
absolute
with
some
idea
of
a
personal
god
with
certain
theological
attributes
nor
does
the
word
principle
appeal
to
us
for
it
seems
to
imply
a
cold
unfeeling
abstract
thing
while
we
conceive
the
absolute
spirit
or
being
to
be
a
warm
vital
living
acting
feeling
reality
we
do
not
use
the
word
nature
which
many
prefer
because
of
its
materialistic
meaning
to
the
minds
of
many
although
the
word
is
very
dear
to
us
when
referring
to
the
outward
manifestation
of
the
absolute
life
of
the
real
nature
of
the
absolute
of
course
we
can
know
practically
nothing
because
it
transcends
all
human
experience
and
man
has
nothing
with
which
he
can
measure
the
infinite
spinoza
was
right
when
he
said
that
to
define
god
is
to
deny
him
for
any
attempt
to
define
is
of
course
an
attempt
to
limit
or
make
finite
the
infinite
to
define
a
thing
is
to
identify
it
with
something
else
and
where
is
the
something
else
with
which
to
identify
the
infinite
the
absolute
can
not
be
described
in
terms
of
the
relative
it
is
not
something
although
it
contains
within
itself
the
reality
underlying
everything
it
can
not
be
said
to
have
the
qualities
of
any
of
its
apparently
separated
parts
for
it
is
the
all
it
is
all
that
really
is
it
is
beyond
matter
force
or
mind
as
we
know
it
and
yet
these
things
emanate
from
it
and
must
be
within
its
nature
for
what
is
in
the
manifested
must
be
in
the
manifestor
no
stream
can
rise
higher
than
its
source
the
effect
can
not
be
greater
than
the
cause
you
can
not
get
something
out
of
nothing
but
it
is
hard
for
the
human
mind
to
take
hold
of
that
which
is
beyond
its
experience
many
philosophers
consider
it
impossible
and
so
we
must
think
of
the
absolute
in
the
concepts
and
terms
of
its
highest
manifestation
we
find
mind
higher
in
the
scale
than
matter
or
energy
and
so
we
are
justified
in
using
the
terms
of
mind
in
speaking
of
the
absolute
rather
than
the
terms
of
matter
or
energy
so
let
us
try
to
think
of
an
infinite
mind
whose
powers
and
capacities
are
raised
to
an
infinite
degree
a
mind
of
which
herbert
spencer
said
that
it
was
a
mode
of
being
as
much
transcending
intelligence
and
will
as
these
transcend
mere
mechanical
motion
while
it
is
true
as
all
occultists
know
that
the
best
information
regarding
the
absolute
come
from
regions
of
the
self
higher
than
intellect
yet
we
are
in
duty
bound
to
examine
the
reports
of
the
intellect
concerning
its
information
regarding
the
one
the
intellect
has
been
developed
in
us
for
use
for
the
purpose
of
examining
considering
thinking
and
it
behooves
us
to
employ
it
by
turning
it
to
this
purpose
we
not
only
strengthen
and
unfold
it
but
we
also
get
certain
information
that
can
reach
us
by
no
other
channel
and
moreover
by
such
use
of
the
intellect
we
are
able
to
discover
many
fallacies
and
errors
that
have
crept
into
our
minds
from
the
opinions
and
dogmas
of
others
as
kant
said
the
chief
and
perhaps
the
only
use
of
a
philosophy
of
pure
reason
is
a
negative
one
it
is
not
an
organon
for
extending
but
a
discipline
for
limiting
instead
of
discovering
truth
its
modest
function
is
to
guard
against
error
let
us
then
listen
to
the
report
of
the
intellect
as
well
as
of
the
higher
fields
of
mentation
one
of
the
first
reports
of
the
intellect
concerning
the
absolute
is
that
it
must
have
existed
forever
and
must
continue
to
exist
forever
there
is
no
escape
from
this
conclusion
whether
one
view
the
matter
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
materialist
philosopher
occultist
or
theologian
the
absolute
could
not
have
sprung
from
nothing
and
there
was
no
other
cause
outside
of
itself
from
which
it
could
have
emanated
and
there
can
be
no
cause
outside
of
itself
which
can
terminate
its
being
and
we
can
not
conceive
of
infinite
life
or
absolute
life
dying
so
the
absolute
must
be
eternal
such
is
the
report
of
the
intellect
this
idea
of
the
eternal
is
practically
unthinkable
to
the
human
mind
although
it
is
forced
to
believe
that
it
must
be
a
quality
of
the
absolute
the
trouble
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
intellect
is
compelled
to
see
everything
through
the
veil
of
time
and
cause
and
effect
now
cause
and
effect
and
time
are
merely
phenomena
or
appearances
of
the
relative
world
and
have
no
place
in
the
absolute
and
real
let
us
see
if
we
can
understand
this
reflection
will
show
you
that
the
only
reason
that
you
are
unable
to
think
of
or
picture
a
causeless
cause
is
because
everything
that
you
have
experienced
in
this
relative
world
of
the
senses
has
had
a
cause
something
from
which
it
sprung
you
have
seen
cause
and
effect
in
full
operation
all
about
you
and
quite
naturally
your
intellect
has
taken
it
for
granted
that
there
can
be
nothing
uncaused
nothing
without
a
preceding
cause
and
the
intellect
is
perfectly
right
so
far
as
things
are
concerned
for
all
things
are
relative
and
are
therefore
caused
but
back
of
the
caused
things
must
lie
that
which
is
the
great
causer
of
things
and
which
not
being
a
thing
itself
can
not
have
been
caused
can
not
be
the
effect
of
a
cause
your
minds
reel
when
you
try
to
form
a
mental
image
of
that
which
has
had
no
cause
because
you
have
had
no
experience
in
the
sense
world
of
such
a
thing
and
there
fail
to
form
the
image
it
is
out
of
your
experience
and
you
can
not
form
the
mental
picture
but
yet
your
mind
is
compelled
to
believe
that
there
must
have
been
an
original
one
that
can
have
had
no
cause
this
is
a
hard
task
for
the
intellect
but
in
time
it
comes
to
see
just
where
the
trouble
lies
and
ceases
to
interpose
objections
to
the
voice
of
the
higher
regions
of
the
self
and
the
intellect
experiences
a
similar
difficulty
when
it
tries
to
think
of
an
eternal
a
that
which
is
above
and
outside
of
time
we
see
time
in
operation
everywhere
and
take
it
for
granted
that
time
is
a
reality
an
actual
thing
but
this
is
a
mistake
of
the
senses
there
is
no
such
thing
as
time
in
reality
time
exists
solely
in
our
minds
it
is
merely
a
form
of
perception
by
which
we
express
our
consciousness
of
the
change
in
things
we
can
not
think
of
time
except
in
connection
with
a
succession
of
changes
of
things
in
our
consciousness
either
things
of
the
outer
world
or
the
passing
of
through
our
mind
a
day
is
merely
the
consciousness
of
the
passing
of
the
sun
an
hour
or
minute
merely
the
subdivision
of
the
day
or
else
the
consciousness
of
the
movement
of
the
hands
of
the
clock
merely
the
consciousness
of
the
movement
of
things
the
symbols
of
changes
in
things
in
a
world
without
changes
in
things
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
time
time
is
but
a
mental
invention
such
is
the
report
of
the
intellect
and
besides
the
conclusions
of
pure
abstract
reasoning
about
time
we
may
see
many
instances
of
the
relativity
of
time
in
our
everyday
experiences
we
all
know
that
when
we
are
interested
time
seems
to
pass
rapidly
and
when
we
are
bored
it
drags
along
in
a
shameful
manner
we
know
that
when
we
are
happy
time
develops
the
speed
of
a
meteor
while
when
we
are
unhappy
it
crawls
like
a
tortoise
when
we
are
interested
or
happy
our
attention
is
largely
diverted
from
the
changes
occurring
in
things
because
we
do
not
notice
the
things
so
closely
and
while
we
are
miserable
or
bored
we
notice
the
details
in
things
and
their
changes
until
the
length
of
time
seems
interminable
a
tiny
insect
mite
may
and
does
live
a
lifetime
of
birth
growth
marriage
reproduction
old
age
and
death
in
a
few
minutes
and
no
doubt
its
life
seems
as
full
as
does
that
of
the
elephant
with
his
hundred
years
why
so
many
things
haze
happened
when
we
are
conscious
of
many
things
happening
we
get
the
impression
and
sensation
of
the
length
of
time
the
greater
the
consciousness
of
things
the
greater
the
sensation
of
time
when
we
are
so
interested
in
talking
to
a
loved
one
that
we
forget
all
that
is
occurring
about
us
then
the
hours
fly
by
unheeded
while
the
same
hours
seem
like
days
to
one
in
the
same
place
who
is
not
interested
or
occupied
with
some
task
men
have
nodded
and
in
the
second
before
awakening
they
have
dreamed
of
events
that
seemed
to
have
required
the
passage
of
years
many
of
you
have
had
experiences
of
this
kind
and
many
such
cases
have
been
recorded
by
science
on
the
other
hand
one
may
fall
asleep
and
remain
unconscious
but
without
dreams
for
hours
and
upon
awakening
will
insist
that
he
has
merely
nodded
time
belongs
to
the
relative
mind
and
has
no
place
in
the
eternal
or
absolute
next
the
intellect
informs
us
that
it
must
think
of
the
absolute
as
infinite
in
space
present
everywhere
omnipresent
it
can
not
be
limited
for
there
is
nothing
outside
of
itself
to
limit
it
there
is
no
such
place
as
nowhere
every
place
is
in
the
everywhere
and
everywhere
is
filled
with
the
all
the
infinite
reality
the
absolute
and
just
as
was
the
case
with
the
idea
of
time
we
find
it
most
difficult
if
not
indeed
impossible
to
form
an
idea
of
an
omnipresent
of
that
which
occupies
infinite
space
this
because
everything
that
our
minds
have
experienced
has
had
dimensions
and
limits
the
secret
lies
in
the
fact
that
space
like
time
has
no
real
existence
outside
of
our
perception
of
consciousness
of
the
relative
position
of
things
material
objects
we
see
this
thing
here
and
that
thing
there
between
them
is
nothingness
we
take
another
object
say
a
and
measure
off
this
nothingness
between
the
two
objects
and
we
call
this
measure
of
nothingness
by
the
term
distance
and
yet
we
can
not
have
measured
nothingness
that
is
impossible
what
have
we
really
done
simply
this
determined
how
many
lengths
of
could
be
laid
between
the
other
two
objects
we
call
this
process
measuring
space
but
space
is
nothing
and
we
have
merely
determined
the
relative
position
of
objects
to
measure
space
we
must
have
three
things
or
objects
l
the
object
from
which
we
start
the
measure
the
object
with
which
we
measure
and
the
object
with
which
we
end
our
measurement
we
are
unable
to
conceive
of
infinite
space
because
we
lack
the
third
object
in
the
measuring
process
the
ending
object
we
may
use
ourselves
as
a
starting
point
and
the
mental
is
always
at
hand
but
where
is
the
object
at
the
other
side
of
infinity
of
space
by
which
the
measurement
may
be
ended
it
is
not
there
and
we
can
not
think
of
the
end
without
it
let
us
start
with
ourselves
and
try
to
imagine
a
million
million
miles
and
then
multiply
them
by
another
million
million
miles
a
million
million
times
what
have
we
done
simply
extended
our
mental
a
certain
number
of
times
to
an
imaginary
point
in
the
nothingness
that
we
call
space
so
far
so
good
but
the
mind
intuitively
recognizes
that
beyond
that
imaginary
point
at
the
end
of
the
last
there
is
a
capacity
for
an
infinite
extension
of
an
infinite
capacity
for
such
extension
extension
of
what
space
no
objects
things
without
material
objects
space
is
unthinkable
it
has
no
existence
outside
of
our
consciousness
of
things
there
is
no
such
thing
as
real
space
space
is
merely
an
infinite
capacity
for
extending
objects
space
itself
is
merely
a
name
for
nothingness
if
you
can
form
an
idea
of
an
object
swept
out
of
existence
and
nothing
to
take
its
place
that
nothing
would
be
called
space
the
term
implying
the
possibility
of
placing
something
there
without
displacing
anything
else
size
of
course
is
but
another
form
of
speaking
of
distance
and
in
this
connection
let
us
not
forget
that
just
as
one
may
think
of
space
being
infinite
in
the
direction
of
largeness
so
may
we
think
of
it
as
being
infinite
in
the
sense
of
smallness
no
matter
how
small
may
be
an
object
thought
of
we
are
still
able
to
think
of
it
as
being
capable
of
subdivision
and
so
on
infinitely
there
is
no
limit
in
this
direction
either
as
jakob
has
said
the
conception
of
the
infinitely
minute
is
as
little
capable
of
being
grasped
by
us
as
is
that
of
the
infinitely
great
despite
this
the
admission
of
the
reality
of
the
infinitude
both
in
the
direction
of
greatness
and
of
minuteness
is
inevitable
and
as
radenhausen
has
said
the
idea
of
space
is
only
an
unavoidable
illusion
of
our
consciousness
or
of
our
finite
nature
and
does
not
exist
outside
of
ourselves
the
universe
is
infinitely
small
and
infinitely
great
the
telescope
has
opened
to
us
ideas
of
magnificent
vastness
and
greatness
and
the
perfected
microscope
has
opened
to
us
a
world
of
magnificent
smallness
and
minuteness
the
latter
has
shown
us
that
a
drop
of
water
is
a
world
of
minute
living
forms
who
live
eat
fight
reproduce
and
die
the
mind
is
capable
of
imagining
a
universe
occupying
no
more
space
than
one
of
the
tiniest
speck
visible
under
the
strongest
microscope
and
then
imagining
such
a
universe
containing
millions
of
suns
and
worlds
similar
to
our
own
and
inhabited
by
living
forms
akin
to
ours
living
thinking
men
and
women
identical
in
every
respect
to
ourselves
indeed
as
some
philosophers
have
said
if
our
universe
were
suddenly
reduced
to
such
a
size
the
relative
proportions
of
everything
being
preserved
of
course
then
we
would
not
be
conscious
of
any
change
and
life
would
go
on
the
same
and
we
would
be
of
the
same
importance
to
ourselves
and
to
the
absolute
as
we
are
this
moment
and
the
same
would
be
true
were
the
universe
suddenly
enlarged
a
times
these
changes
would
make
no
difference
in
reality
compared
with
each
other
the
tiniest
speck
and
the
largest
sun
are
practically
the
same
size
when
viewed
from
the
absolute
we
have
dwelt
upon
these
things
so
that
you
would
be
able
to
better
realize
the
relativity
of
space
and
time
and
perceive
that
they
are
merely
symbols
of
things
used
by
the
mind
in
dealing
with
finite
objects
and
have
no
place
in
reality
when
this
is
realized
then
the
idea
of
infinity
in
time
and
space
is
more
readily
grasped
as
radenhausen
says
beyond
the
range
of
human
reason
there
is
neither
space
nor
time
they
are
arbitrary
conceptions
of
man
at
which
he
has
arrived
by
the
comparison
and
arrangement
of
different
impressions
which
he
has
received
from
the
outside
world
the
conception
of
space
arises
from
the
sequence
of
the
various
forms
which
fill
space
by
which
the
external
world
appears
to
the
individual
man
the
conception
of
time
arises
from
the
sequence
of
the
various
forms
which
change
in
space
motion
by
which
the
external
world
acts
on
the
individual
man
and
so
on
but
externally
to
ourselves
the
distinction
between
repletion
of
space
and
mutation
of
space
does
not
exist
for
each
is
in
constant
transmutation
whatever
is
is
filling
and
changing
at
the
same
time
nothing
is
at
a
standstill
and
to
quote
ruckert
the
world
has
neither
beginning
nor
end
in
space
nor
in
time
everywhere
is
center
and
and
in
a
moment
is
eternity
next
the
intellect
informs
us
that
we
must
think
of
the
absolute
as
containing
within
itself
all
the
power
there
is
because
there
can
be
no
other
source
or
reservoir
of
power
and
there
can
be
no
power
outside
of
the
there
can
be
no
power
outside
of
the
absolute
to
limit
confine
or
conflict
with
it
any
laws
of
the
universe
must
have
been
imposed
by
it
for
there
is
no
other
and
every
manifestation
of
energy
force
or
power
perceived
or
evident
in
nature
must
be
a
part
of
the
power
of
the
absolute
working
along
lines
laid
down
by
it
in
the
third
lesson
which
will
be
entitled
the
we
shall
see
this
power
manifesting
along
the
lines
of
life
as
we
know
it
next
the
intellect
informs
us
that
it
is
compelled
to
think
of
the
absolute
as
containing
within
itself
all
possible
knowledge
or
wisdom
because
there
can
be
no
knowledge
or
wisdom
outside
of
it
and
therefore
all
the
wisdom
and
knowledge
possible
must
be
within
it
we
see
mind
wisdom
and
knowledge
manifested
by
relative
forms
of
life
and
such
must
emanate
from
the
absolute
in
accordance
with
certain
laws
laid
down
by
it
for
otherwise
there
would
be
no
such
wisdom
for
there
is
nowhere
outside
of
the
all
from
whence
it
could
come
the
effect
can
not
be
greater
than
the
cause
if
there
is
anything
unknown
to
the
absolute
then
it
will
never
be
known
to
finite
minds
so
therefore
all
knowledge
that
is
has
been
or
can
be
must
be
now
vested
in
the
one
the
absolute
this
does
not
mean
that
the
absolute
in
any
such
sense
as
does
man
the
absolute
must
know
without
thinking
it
does
not
have
to
gather
knowledge
by
the
process
of
thinking
as
does
man
such
an
idea
would
be
ridiculous
for
from
whence
could
the
knowledge
come
outside
of
itself
when
man
thinks
he
draws
to
himself
knowledge
from
the
universal
source
by
the
action
of
the
mind
but
the
absolute
has
only
itself
to
draw
on
so
we
can
not
imagine
the
absolute
compelled
to
think
as
we
do
but
lest
we
be
misunderstood
regarding
this
phase
of
the
subject
we
may
say
here
that
the
highest
occult
teachings
inform
us
that
the
absolute
manifest
a
quality
somewhat
akin
to
what
we
would
call
constructive
thought
and
that
such
thoughts
manifest
into
objectivity
and
manifestation
and
become
creation
created
things
according
to
the
occult
teachings
are
thoughts
of
god
do
not
let
this
idea
disturb
you
and
cause
you
to
feel
that
you
are
nothing
because
you
have
been
called
into
being
by
a
thought
of
the
infinite
one
even
a
thought
of
that
one
would
be
intensely
real
in
the
relative
world
actually
real
to
all
except
the
absolute
itself
and
even
the
absolute
knows
that
the
part
of
its
creations
must
be
a
part
of
itself
manifested
through
its
thought
for
the
thought
of
the
infinite
must
be
real
and
a
part
of
itself
for
it
can
not
be
anything
else
and
to
call
it
nothing
is
merely
to
juggle
with
words
the
faintest
thought
of
the
infinite
one
would
be
far
more
real
than
anything
man
could
create
as
solid
as
the
mountain
as
hard
as
steel
as
durable
as
the
diamond
for
verily
even
these
are
emanations
of
the
mind
of
the
infinite
and
are
things
of
but
a
day
while
the
higher
thoughts
the
soul
of
man
contains
within
itself
a
spark
from
the
divine
flame
itself
the
spirit
of
the
infinite
but
these
things
will
appear
in
their
own
place
as
we
proceed
with
this
series
we
have
merely
given
you
a
little
food
for
thought
at
this
point
in
connection
with
the
mind
of
the
absolute
so
you
see
good
friends
and
students
that
the
intellect
in
its
highest
efforts
informs
us
that
it
finds
itself
compelled
to
report
that
the
one
the
absolute
that
which
it
is
compelled
to
admit
really
exists
must
be
a
one
possessed
of
a
nature
so
far
transcending
human
experience
that
the
human
mind
finds
itself
without
the
proper
concepts
symbols
and
words
with
which
to
think
of
it
but
none
the
less
the
intellect
finds
itself
bound
by
its
own
laws
to
postulate
the
existence
of
such
an
one
it
is
the
veriest
folly
to
try
to
think
of
the
one
as
it
is
in
itself
for
we
have
nothing
but
human
attributes
with
which
to
measure
it
and
it
so
far
transcends
such
measurements
that
the
mental
run
out
into
infinity
and
are
lost
sight
of
the
highest
minds
of
the
race
inform
us
that
the
most
exalted
efforts
of
their
reason
compels
them
to
report
that
the
one
in
itself
can
not
be
spoken
of
as
possessing
attributes
or
qualities
capable
of
being
expressed
in
human
words
employed
to
describe
the
things
of
the
relative
world
and
all
of
our
words
are
such
all
of
our
words
originate
from
such
ideas
and
all
of
our
ideas
arise
from
our
experience
directly
or
indirectly
so
we
are
not
equipped
with
words
with
which
to
think
of
or
speak
of
that
which
transcends
experience
although
our
intellect
informs
us
that
reality
lies
back
of
our
experience
philosophy
finds
itself
unable
to
do
anything
better
than
to
bring
us
face
to
face
with
high
paradoxes
science
in
its
pursuit
of
truth
finds
it
cunningly
avoiding
it
and
ever
escaping
its
net
and
we
believe
that
the
absolute
purposely
causes
this
to
be
that
in
the
end
man
may
be
compelled
to
look
for
the
spirit
within
himself
the
only
place
where
he
can
come
in
touch
with
it
this
we
think
is
the
answer
to
the
riddle
of
the
sphinx
look
within
for
that
which
thou
needest
but
while
the
spirit
may
be
discerned
only
by
looking
within
ourselves
we
find
that
once
the
mind
realizes
that
the
absolute
is
it
will
be
able
to
see
countless
evidences
of
its
action
and
presence
by
observing
manifested
life
without
all
life
is
filled
with
the
life
power
and
will
of
the
absolute
to
us
life
is
but
one
the
universe
is
a
living
unity
throbbing
thrilling
and
pulsating
with
the
of
the
absolute
back
of
all
apparent
shapes
forms
names
forces
elements
principles
and
substances
there
is
but
one
one
life
present
everywhere
and
manifesting
in
an
infinitude
of
shapes
forms
and
forces
all
individual
lives
are
but
centers
of
consciousness
in
the
one
life
underlying
depending
upon
it
for
degree
of
unfoldment
expression
and
manifestation
this
may
sound
like
pantheism
to
some
but
it
is
very
different
from
the
pantheism
of
the
schools
and
cults
pantheism
is
defined
as
the
doctrine
that
god
consists
in
the
combined
forces
and
laws
manifested
in
the
existing
universe
or
that
the
universe
taken
or
conceived
as
a
whole
is
god
these
definitions
do
not
fit
the
conception
of
the
absolute
of
the
yogi
philosophy
they
seem
to
breathe
but
a
refined
materialism
the
absolute
is
not
the
combined
forces
and
laws
manifested
in
the
universe
nor
the
universe
conceived
as
a
whole
instead
the
universe
its
forces
and
laws
even
conceived
as
a
whole
have
no
existence
in
themselves
but
are
mere
manifestations
of
the
absolute
surely
this
is
different
from
pantheism
we
teach
that
the
absolute
is
immanent
in
and
abiding
in
all
forms
of
life
in
the
universe
as
well
as
in
its
forces
and
laws
all
being
but
manifestations
of
the
will
of
the
one
and
we
teach
that
this
one
is
superior
to
all
forms
of
manifestations
and
that
its
existence
and
being
does
not
depend
upon
the
manifestations
which
are
but
effects
of
the
cause
the
pantheistic
universe
god
is
but
a
thing
of
phenomenal
appearance
but
the
absolute
is
the
very
spirit
of
life
a
living
existing
reality
and
would
be
so
even
if
every
manifestation
were
withdrawn
from
appearance
and
expression
drawn
back
into
the
source
from
which
it
emanated
the
absolute
is
more
than
mountain
or
ocean
electricity
or
gravitation
monad
or
man
it
is
spirit
life
being
reality
the
one
that
is
omnipotent
omnipresent
omniscient
eternal
infinite
absolute
these
are
man
greatest
words
and
yet
they
but
feebly
portray
a
shadow
thrown
by
the
one
itself
the
absolute
is
not
a
being
directing
our
affairs
at
long
range
not
an
absentee
deity
but
an
immanent
life
in
and
about
us
all
manifesting
in
us
and
creating
us
into
individual
centers
of
consciousness
in
pursuance
with
some
great
law
of
being
and
more
than
this
the
absolute
instead
of
being
an
indifferent
and
unmoved
spectator
to
its
own
creation
is
a
thriving
longing
active
suffering
rejoicing
feeling
spirit
partaking
of
the
feelings
of
its
manifestations
rather
than
callously
witnessing
them
it
lives
in
us
with
us
through
us
back
of
all
the
pain
in
the
world
may
be
found
a
great
feeling
and
suffering
love
the
pain
of
the
world
is
not
punishment
or
evidence
of
divine
wrath
but
the
incidents
of
the
working
out
of
some
cosmic
plan
in
which
the
absolute
is
the
actor
through
the
forms
of
its
manifestations
the
message
of
the
absolute
to
some
of
the
illumined
has
been
all
is
being
done
in
the
best
and
only
possible
way
i
am
doing
the
best
i
can
all
is
well
and
in
the
end
will
so
appear
the
absolute
is
no
personal
deity
yet
in
itself
it
contains
all
that
goes
to
make
up
all
personality
and
all
human
relations
father
mother
child
friend
is
in
it
all
forms
of
human
love
and
craving
for
sympathy
understanding
and
companionship
may
find
refuge
in
loving
the
absolute
the
absolute
is
constantly
in
evidence
in
our
lives
and
yet
we
have
been
seeking
it
here
and
there
in
the
outer
world
asking
it
to
show
itself
and
prove
its
existence
well
may
it
say
to
us
hast
thou
been
so
long
time
with
me
and
hast
thou
not
known
me
this
is
the
great
tragedy
of
life
that
the
spirit
comes
to
us
its
own
and
we
know
it
not
we
fail
to
hear
its
words
oh
ye
who
mourn
i
suffer
with
you
and
through
you
yea
it
is
i
who
grieve
in
you
your
pain
is
mine
to
the
last
pang
i
suffer
all
pain
through
you
and
yet
i
rejoice
beyond
you
for
i
know
that
through
you
and
with
you
i
shall
conquer
and
this
is
a
faint
idea
of
what
we
believe
the
absolute
to
be
in
the
following
lessons
we
shall
see
it
in
operation
in
all
forms
of
life
and
in
ourselves
we
shall
get
close
to
the
workings
of
its
mighty
will
close
to
its
heart
of
love
carry
with
you
the
central
thought
of
the
lesson
central
thought
there
is
but
one
life
in
the
universe
and
underlying
that
one
life
its
real
self
its
essence
its
spirit
is
the
absolute
living
feeling
suffering
rejoicing
longing
striving
in
and
through
us
the
absolute
is
all
that
really
is
and
all
the
visible
universe
and
forms
of
life
is
its
expression
through
its
will
we
lack
words
adequate
to
describe
the
nature
of
the
absolute
but
we
will
use
two
words
describing
its
inmost
nature
as
best
we
see
it
these
two
words
are
life
and
love
the
one
describing
the
outer
the
other
the
inner
nature
let
us
manifest
both
life
and
love
as
a
token
of
our
origin
and
inner
nature
peace
be
with
you
the
second
lesson
omnipresent
life
in
our
first
lesson
of
this
series
we
brought
out
the
idea
that
the
human
mind
was
compelled
to
report
the
fact
that
it
could
not
think
of
the
absolute
except
as
possessing
the
quality
of
omnipresence
and
likewise
the
human
mind
is
compelled
to
think
that
all
there
is
must
be
the
absolute
or
the
absolute
and
if
a
thing
is
the
absolute
then
the
absolute
must
be
it
in
some
way
must
be
the
of
it
granting
this
we
must
then
think
that
everything
must
be
filled
with
the
essence
of
life
for
life
must
be
one
of
the
qualities
of
the
absolute
or
rather
what
we
call
life
must
be
the
outward
expression
of
the
essential
being
of
the
absolute
and
if
this
be
so
then
it
would
follow
that
in
the
universe
must
be
the
mind
can
not
escape
this
conclusion
and
if
the
facts
do
not
bear
out
this
conclusion
then
we
must
be
forced
to
admit
that
the
entire
basic
theory
of
the
absolute
and
its
emanations
must
fall
and
be
considered
as
an
error
no
chain
is
stronger
than
its
weakest
link
and
if
this
link
be
too
weak
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
facts
of
the
universe
then
must
the
chain
be
discarded
as
imperfect
and
useless
and
another
substituted
this
fact
is
not
generally
mentioned
by
those
speaking
and
writing
of
all
being
one
or
an
emanation
of
the
one
but
it
must
be
considered
and
met
if
there
is
a
single
thing
in
the
universe
that
is
dead
lifeless
then
the
theory
must
fall
if
a
thing
is
then
the
essence
of
the
absolute
can
not
be
in
it
it
must
be
alien
and
foreign
to
the
absolute
and
in
that
case
the
absolute
can
not
be
absolute
for
there
is
something
outside
of
itself
and
so
it
becomes
of
the
greatest
importance
to
examine
into
the
evidences
of
the
presence
of
life
in
all
things
organic
or
inorganic
the
evidence
is
at
hand
let
us
examine
it
the
ancient
occultists
of
all
peoples
always
taught
that
the
universe
was
alive
that
there
was
life
in
everything
that
there
was
nothing
dead
in
nature
that
death
meant
simply
a
change
in
form
in
the
material
of
the
dead
bodies
they
taught
that
life
in
varying
degrees
of
manifestation
and
expression
was
present
in
everything
and
object
even
down
to
the
hardest
mineral
form
and
the
atoms
composing
that
form
modern
science
is
now
rapidly
advancing
to
the
same
position
and
each
months
investigations
and
discoveries
serve
only
to
emphasize
the
teachings
burbank
that
wonderful
moulder
of
plant
life
has
well
expressed
this
thought
when
he
says
all
my
investigations
have
led
me
away
from
the
idea
of
a
dead
material
universe
tossed
about
by
various
forces
to
that
of
a
universe
which
is
absolutely
all
force
life
soul
thought
or
whatever
name
we
may
choose
to
call
it
every
atom
molecule
plant
animal
or
planet
is
only
an
aggregation
of
organized
unit
forces
held
in
place
by
stronger
forces
thus
holding
them
for
a
time
latent
though
teeming
with
inconceivable
power
all
life
on
our
planet
is
so
to
speak
just
on
the
outer
fringe
of
this
infinite
ocean
of
force
the
universe
is
not
half
dead
but
all
alive
science
today
is
gazing
upon
a
living
universe
she
has
not
yet
realized
the
full
significance
of
what
she
has
discovered
and
her
hands
are
raised
as
if
to
shade
her
eyes
from
the
unaccustomed
glare
that
is
bursting
upon
her
from
the
dark
cavern
of
universal
dead
matter
she
has
stepped
out
into
the
glare
of
the
sun
of
a
universe
even
to
its
smallest
and
apparently
most
inert
particle
beginning
at
man
the
highest
form
of
life
known
to
us
we
may
pass
rapidly
down
the
scale
of
animal
life
seeing
life
in
full
operation
at
each
descending
step
passing
from
the
animal
to
the
vegetable
kingdom
we
still
see
life
in
full
operation
although
in
lessened
degrees
of
expression
we
shall
not
stop
here
to
review
the
many
manifestations
of
life
among
the
forms
of
for
we
shall
have
occasion
to
mention
them
in
our
next
lesson
but
it
must
be
apparent
to
all
that
life
is
constantly
manifesting
in
the
sprouting
of
seeds
the
putting
forth
of
stalk
leaves
blossoms
fruit
and
in
the
enormous
manifestation
of
force
and
energy
in
such
growth
and
development
one
may
see
the
life
force
in
the
plant
pressing
forth
for
expression
and
manifestation
from
the
first
sprouting
of
the
seed
until
the
last
vital
action
on
the
part
of
the
mature
plant
or
tree
besides
the
vital
action
observable
in
the
growth
and
development
of
plants
we
know
of
course
that
plants
sicken
and
die
and
manifest
all
other
attributes
of
living
forms
there
is
no
room
for
argument
about
the
presence
of
life
in
the
plant
kingdom
but
there
are
other
forms
of
life
far
below
the
scale
of
the
plants
there
is
the
world
of
the
bacteria
microbes
infusoria
the
groups
of
cells
with
a
common
life
the
single
cell
creatures
down
to
the
monera
the
creatures
lower
than
the
single
cells
the
things
of
the
slime
of
the
ocean
bed
these
tiny
things
living
things
present
to
the
sight
merely
a
tiny
speck
of
jelly
without
organs
of
any
kind
and
yet
they
exercise
all
the
functions
of
life
movement
nutrition
reproduction
sensation
and
dissolution
some
of
these
elementary
forms
are
all
stomach
that
is
they
are
all
one
organ
capable
of
performing
all
the
functions
necessary
for
the
life
of
the
animal
the
creature
has
no
mouth
but
when
it
wishes
to
devour
an
object
it
simply
envelopes
it
wraps
itself
around
it
like
a
bit
of
glue
around
a
gnat
and
then
absorbs
the
substance
of
its
prey
through
its
whole
body
scientists
have
turned
some
of
these
tiny
creatures
inside
out
and
yet
they
have
gone
on
with
their
life
functions
undisturbed
and
untroubled
they
have
cut
them
up
into
still
tinier
bits
and
yet
each
bit
lived
on
as
a
separate
animal
performing
all
of
its
functions
undisturbed
they
are
all
the
same
all
over
and
all
the
way
through
they
reproduce
themselves
by
growing
to
a
certain
size
and
then
separating
into
two
and
so
on
the
rapidity
of
the
increase
is
most
remarkable
haekel
says
of
the
monera
the
monera
are
the
simplest
permanent
cytods
their
entire
body
consists
of
merely
soft
structureless
plasm
however
thoroughly
we
may
examine
them
with
the
help
of
the
most
delicate
reagents
and
the
strongest
optical
instruments
we
yet
find
that
all
the
parts
are
completely
homogeneous
these
monera
are
therefore
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
without
organs
or
even
in
a
strict
philosophical
sense
they
might
not
even
be
called
organisms
since
they
possess
no
organs
and
since
they
are
not
composed
of
various
particles
they
can
only
be
called
organisms
in
so
far
as
they
are
capable
of
exercising
the
organic
phenomena
of
life
of
nutrition
reproduction
sensation
and
movement
verworn
records
an
interesting
instance
of
life
and
mind
among
the
a
very
low
form
of
living
thing
he
relates
that
the
a
creature
occupying
a
tiny
shell
formed
of
minute
particles
of
sand
has
a
long
projection
of
its
substance
like
a
feeler
or
tendril
with
which
it
searches
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
sandy
material
with
which
to
build
the
shell
or
outer
covering
for
its
offspring
which
are
born
by
division
from
the
parent
body
it
grasps
the
particle
of
sand
by
the
feeler
and
passes
it
into
its
body
by
enclosing
it
verworn
removed
the
sand
from
the
bottom
of
the
tank
replacing
it
by
very
minute
particles
of
highly
colored
glass
shortly
afterward
he
noticed
a
collection
of
these
particles
of
glass
in
the
body
of
the
creature
and
a
little
later
he
saw
a
tiny
speck
of
protoplasm
emitted
from
the
parent
by
separation
at
the
same
time
he
noticed
that
the
bits
of
glass
collected
by
the
mother
creature
were
passed
out
and
placed
around
the
body
of
the
new
creature
and
cemented
together
by
a
substance
secreted
by
the
body
of
the
parent
thus
forming
a
shell
and
covering
for
the
offspring
this
proceeding
showed
the
presence
of
a
mental
something
sufficient
to
cause
the
creature
to
prepare
a
shell
for
the
offspring
previous
to
its
birth
or
rather
to
gather
the
material
for
such
shell
to
be
afterward
used
to
distinguish
the
proper
material
to
mould
it
into
shape
and
cement
it
the
scientist
reported
that
a
creature
always
gathered
just
exactly
enough
sand
for
its
purpose
never
too
little
and
never
an
excess
and
this
in
a
creature
that
is
little
more
than
a
tiny
drop
of
glue
we
may
consider
the
life
actions
of
the
moneron
a
little
further
for
it
is
the
lowest
form
of
living
matter
the
point
at
which
living
forms
pass
off
into
forms
this
tiny
speck
of
glue
an
organism
without
organs
is
endowed
with
the
faculty
called
sensation
it
draws
away
from
that
which
is
likely
to
injure
it
and
toward
that
which
it
desires
all
in
response
to
an
elementary
sensation
it
has
the
instinct
of
and
it
seeks
and
finds
its
prey
and
then
eats
digests
and
assimilates
it
it
is
able
to
move
about
by
or
bits
of
its
body
which
it
pushes
forth
at
will
from
any
part
of
its
substance
it
reproduces
itself
as
we
have
seen
by
separation
and
the
life
of
the
bacteria
and
germs
the
yeasty
forms
of
life
are
familiar
to
many
of
us
and
yet
there
are
forms
of
life
still
below
these
the
line
between
living
forms
and
forms
is
being
set
back
further
and
further
by
science
living
creatures
are
now
known
that
resemble
the
so
closely
that
the
line
can
not
be
definitely
drawn
living
creatures
are
known
that
are
capable
of
being
dried
and
laid
away
for
several
years
and
then
may
be
revived
by
the
application
of
moisture
they
resemble
dust
but
are
full
of
life
and
function
certain
forms
of
bacilli
are
known
to
science
that
have
been
subjected
to
degrees
of
heat
and
cold
that
are
but
terms
to
any
but
the
scientific
mind
low
forms
of
life
called
diatoms
or
living
crystals
are
known
they
are
tiny
geometrical
forms
they
are
composed
of
a
tiny
drop
of
plasm
resembling
glue
covered
by
a
thin
shell
of
siliceous
or
sandy
material
they
are
visible
only
through
the
microscope
and
are
so
small
that
thousands
of
them
might
be
gathered
together
on
the
head
of
a
pin
they
are
so
like
chemical
crystals
that
it
requires
a
shrewd
and
careful
observer
to
distinguish
them
and
yet
they
are
alive
and
perform
all
the
functions
of
life
leaving
these
creatures
we
enter
the
kingdom
of
the
crystals
in
our
search
for
life
yes
the
crystals
manifest
life
as
strange
as
this
statement
may
appear
to
those
who
have
not
followed
the
march
of
science
the
crystals
are
born
grow
live
and
may
be
killed
by
chemicals
or
electricity
science
has
added
a
new
department
called
plasmology
the
purpose
of
which
is
the
study
of
crystal
life
some
investigators
have
progressed
so
far
as
to
claim
that
they
have
discovered
signs
of
rudimentary
sex
functioning
among
crystals
at
any
rate
crystals
are
born
and
grow
like
living
things
as
a
recent
scientific
writer
has
said
crystallization
as
we
are
to
learn
now
is
not
a
mere
mechanical
grouping
of
dead
atoms
it
is
a
birth
the
crystal
forms
from
the
mother
liquor
and
its
body
is
built
up
systematically
regularly
and
according
to
a
well
defined
plan
or
pattern
just
as
are
the
body
and
bones
of
the
animal
form
and
the
wood
and
bark
of
the
tree
there
is
life
at
work
in
the
growth
of
the
crystal
and
not
only
does
the
crystal
grow
but
it
also
reproduces
itself
by
separation
or
just
as
is
the
case
with
the
lower
forms
of
life
just
mentioned
the
principal
point
of
difference
between
the
growth
and
development
of
the
crystals
and
that
of
the
lower
forms
of
life
referred
to
is
that
the
crystal
takes
its
nourishment
from
the
outside
and
builds
up
from
its
outer
surface
while
the
monera
absorbs
its
nourishment
from
within
and
grows
outwardly
from
within
if
the
crystal
had
a
soft
center
and
took
its
nourishment
in
that
way
it
would
be
almost
identical
with
the
diatom
or
if
the
diatom
grew
from
the
outside
it
would
be
but
a
crystal
a
very
fine
dividing
line
crystals
like
living
forms
may
be
sterilized
and
rendered
incapable
of
reproduction
by
chemical
process
or
electrical
discharges
they
may
also
be
killed
and
future
growth
prevented
in
this
manner
surely
this
looks
like
life
does
it
not
to
realize
the
importance
of
this
idea
of
life
among
the
crystals
we
must
remember
that
our
hardest
rocks
and
metals
are
composed
of
crystals
and
that
the
dirt
and
earth
upon
which
we
grow
and
live
are
but
crumbled
rock
and
miniature
crystals
therefore
the
very
dust
under
our
feet
is
alive
is
nothing
there
is
no
transformation
of
dead
matter
into
live
plant
matter
and
then
into
live
animal
matter
the
chemicals
are
alive
and
from
chemical
to
man
body
there
is
but
a
continuous
change
of
shape
and
form
of
living
matter
any
man
body
decomposing
is
again
resolved
into
chemicals
and
the
chain
begins
over
again
merely
changes
in
living
forms
that
all
so
far
as
the
bodies
are
concerned
nature
furnishes
us
with
many
examples
of
this
presence
of
life
in
the
inorganic
world
we
have
but
to
look
around
to
see
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
all
is
alive
there
is
that
which
is
known
as
the
fatigue
of
elasticity
in
metals
razors
get
tired
and
require
a
rest
tuning
forks
lose
their
powers
of
vibration
to
a
degree
and
have
to
be
given
a
vacation
in
mills
and
manufactories
needs
an
occasional
day
off
metals
are
subject
to
disease
and
infection
and
have
been
poisoned
and
restored
by
antidotes
window
glass
especially
stained
glass
is
subject
to
a
disease
spreading
from
pane
to
pane
men
accustomed
to
handling
and
using
tools
and
machinery
naturally
drop
into
the
habit
of
speaking
of
these
things
as
if
they
were
alive
they
seem
to
recognize
the
presence
of
feeling
in
tools
or
machine
and
to
perceive
in
each
a
sort
of
character
or
personality
which
must
be
respected
humored
or
coaxed
in
order
to
get
the
best
results
perhaps
the
most
valuable
testimony
along
these
lines
and
which
goes
very
far
toward
proving
the
theories
of
the
yogis
regarding
omnipresent
life
comes
from
chunder
bose
of
the
calcutta
university
a
hindu
educated
in
the
english
universities
under
the
best
teachers
and
who
is
now
a
leading
scientific
authority
in
the
western
world
tie
has
given
to
the
world
some
very
valuable
scientific
information
along
these
lines
in
his
book
entitled
in
the
living
and
which
has
caused
the
widest
comment
and
created
the
greatest
interest
among
the
highest
scientific
authorities
his
experiments
along
the
lines
of
the
gathering
of
evidence
of
life
in
the
inorganic
forms
have
revolutionized
the
theories
of
modern
science
and
have
done
much
to
further
the
idea
that
life
is
present
everywhere
and
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
dead
matter
he
bases
his
work
upon
the
theory
that
the
best
and
only
true
test
for
the
presence
of
life
in
matter
is
the
response
of
matter
to
external
stimulus
proceeding
from
this
fundamental
theory
he
has
proven
by
experiments
that
inorganic
matter
minerals
metals
give
a
response
to
such
stimulus
which
response
is
similar
if
not
identical
to
the
response
of
the
matter
composing
the
bodies
of
plants
animals
men
he
devised
delicate
apparatus
for
the
measurement
of
the
response
to
the
outside
stimulus
the
degree
and
other
evidence
being
recorded
in
traces
on
a
revolving
cylinder
the
tracings
or
curves
obtained
from
tin
and
other
metals
when
compared
with
those
obtained
from
living
muscle
were
found
to
be
identical
he
used
a
galvanometer
a
very
delicate
and
accurate
scientific
instrument
in
his
experiments
this
instrument
is
so
finely
adjusted
that
the
faintest
current
will
cause
a
deflection
of
the
registering
needle
which
is
delicately
swung
on
a
tiny
pivot
if
the
galvanometer
be
attached
to
a
human
nerve
and
the
end
of
the
nerve
be
irritated
the
needle
will
register
bose
found
that
when
he
attached
the
galvanometer
to
bars
of
various
metals
they
gave
a
similar
response
when
struck
or
twisted
the
greater
the
irritation
applied
to
the
metal
the
greater
the
response
registered
by
the
instrument
the
analogy
between
the
response
of
the
metal
and
that
of
the
living
muscle
was
startling
for
instance
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
living
animal
muscle
or
nerve
matter
the
response
becomes
fatigued
so
in
the
case
of
the
metal
the
curve
registered
by
the
needle
became
fainter
and
still
fainter
as
the
bar
became
more
and
more
fatigued
by
the
continued
irritation
and
again
just
after
such
fatigue
the
muscle
would
become
rested
and
would
again
respond
actively
so
would
the
metal
when
given
a
chance
to
recuperate
tetanus
due
to
shocks
constantly
repeated
was
caused
and
recovered
metals
recorded
evidences
of
fatigue
drugs
caused
identical
effects
on
metals
and
animals
some
exciting
some
depressing
some
killing
some
poisonous
chemicals
killed
pieces
of
metal
rendering
them
immobile
and
therefore
incapable
of
registering
records
on
the
apparatus
in
some
cases
antidotes
were
promptly
administered
and
saved
the
life
of
the
metal
bose
also
conducted
experiments
on
plants
in
the
same
way
pieces
of
vegetable
matter
were
found
to
be
capable
of
stimulation
fatigue
excitement
depression
poison
annie
besant
who
witnessed
some
of
these
experiments
in
calcutta
has
written
as
follows
regarding
the
experiments
on
plant
life
there
is
something
rather
pathetic
in
seeing
the
way
in
which
the
tiny
spot
of
light
which
records
the
pulses
in
the
plant
travels
in
ever
weaker
and
weaker
curves
when
the
plant
is
under
the
influence
of
poison
then
falls
into
a
final
despairing
straight
line
and
stops
one
feels
as
though
a
murder
has
been
committed
as
indeed
it
has
in
one
of
bose
public
experiments
he
clearly
demonstrated
that
a
bar
of
iron
was
fully
as
sensitive
as
the
human
body
and
that
it
could
be
irritated
and
stimulated
in
the
same
way
and
finally
could
be
poisoned
and
killed
among
such
phenomena
he
asks
how
can
we
draw
the
line
of
demarkation
and
say
the
physical
ends
and
there
the
physiological
begins
no
such
barrier
exists
according
to
his
theory
which
agrees
with
the
oldest
occult
theories
by
the
way
life
is
present
in
every
object
and
form
of
nature
and
all
forms
respond
to
external
stimulus
which
response
is
a
proof
of
the
presence
of
life
in
the
form
bose
great
book
is
full
of
the
most
startling
results
of
experiments
he
proves
that
the
metals
manifest
something
like
sleep
can
be
killed
exhibit
torpor
and
sluggishness
get
tired
or
lazy
wake
up
can
be
roused
into
activity
may
be
stimulated
strengthened
weakened
suffer
from
extreme
cold
and
heat
may
be
drugged
or
intoxicated
the
different
metals
manifesting
a
different
response
to
certain
drugs
just
as
different
men
and
animals
manifest
a
varying
degree
of
similar
resistance
the
response
of
a
piece
of
steel
subjected
to
the
influence
of
a
chemical
poison
shows
a
gradual
fluttering
and
weakening
until
it
finally
dies
away
just
as
animal
matter
does
when
similarly
poisoned
when
revived
in
time
by
an
antidote
the
recovery
was
similarly
gradual
in
both
metal
and
muscle
a
remarkable
fact
is
noted
by
the
scientist
when
he
tells
us
that
the
very
poisons
that
kill
the
metals
are
themselves
alive
and
may
be
killed
drugged
stimulated
showing
the
same
response
as
in
the
case
of
the
metals
proving
the
existence
in
them
of
the
same
life
that
is
in
the
metals
and
animal
matter
that
they
influence
of
course
when
these
metals
are
killed
there
is
merely
a
killing
of
the
metal
as
metal
the
atoms
and
principles
of
which
the
metal
is
composed
remaining
fully
alive
and
active
just
as
is
the
case
with
the
atom
of
the
human
body
after
the
soul
passes
out
the
body
is
as
much
alive
after
death
as
during
the
life
of
the
person
the
activity
of
the
parts
being
along
the
lines
of
dissolution
instead
of
construction
in
that
case
we
hear
much
of
the
claims
of
scientists
who
announce
that
they
are
on
the
eve
of
life
from
matter
this
is
all
nonsense
life
can
come
only
from
life
life
from
is
an
absurdity
and
all
life
comes
from
the
one
life
underlying
all
but
it
is
true
that
science
has
done
is
doing
and
will
do
something
very
much
like
creating
life
but
of
course
this
is
merely
changing
the
form
of
life
into
other
forms
the
lesser
form
into
the
higher
just
as
one
produces
a
plant
from
a
seed
or
a
fruit
from
a
plant
the
life
is
always
there
and
responds
to
the
proper
stimulus
and
conditions
a
number
of
scientists
are
working
on
the
problem
of
generating
living
forms
from
inorganic
matter
the
old
idea
of
spontaneous
generation
for
many
years
relegated
to
the
of
science
is
again
coming
to
the
front
although
the
theory
of
evolution
compels
its
adherents
to
accept
the
idea
that
at
one
time
in
the
past
living
forms
sprung
from
the
yet
it
has
been
generally
believed
that
the
conditions
which
brought
about
this
stage
of
evolution
has
forever
passed
but
the
indications
now
all
point
to
the
other
view
that
this
stage
of
evolution
is
and
always
has
been
in
operation
and
that
new
forms
of
life
are
constantly
evolving
from
the
inorganic
forms
creation
although
the
word
is
an
absurdity
from
the
yogi
point
of
view
is
constantly
being
performed
charlton
bastian
of
london
has
long
been
a
prominent
advocate
of
this
theory
of
continuous
spontaneous
generation
laughed
down
and
considered
defeated
by
the
leading
scientific
minds
of
a
generation
ago
he
still
pluckily
kept
at
work
and
his
recent
books
were
like
bombshells
in
the
orthodox
scientific
camp
he
has
taken
more
than
five
thousand
all
showing
most
startling
facts
in
connection
with
the
origin
of
living
forms
from
the
inorganic
he
claims
that
the
microscope
reveals
the
development
in
a
previously
clear
liquid
of
very
minute
black
spots
which
gradually
enlarge
and
transform
into
bacteria
living
forms
of
a
very
low
order

demonstrated
that

may
produce

action

sterilized
radium
chloride
minute
living
bodies
which
manifest
growth
and
subdivision
science
is
being
gradually
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
living
forms
are
still
arising
in
the
world
by
natural
processes
which
is
not
at
all
remarkable
when
one
remembers
that
natural
law
is
uniform
and
continuous
these
recent
discoveries
go
to
swell
the
already
large
list
of
modern
scientific
ideas
which
correspond
with
the
yogi
teachings
when
the
occult
explanation
that
there
is
life
in
everything
as
well
as
and
that
evolution
is
constant
is
heard
then
may
we
see
that
these
experiments
simply
prove
that
the
forms
of
life
may
be
changed
and
developed
not
that
life
may
be
created
the
chemical
and
mineral
world
furnish
us
with
many
instances
of
the
growth
and
development
of
forms
closely
resembling
the
forms
of
the
vegetable
world
what
is
known
as
metallic
vegetation
as
shown
in
the
lead
tree
gives
us
an
interesting
example
of
this
phenomenon
the
experiment
is
performed
by
placing
in
a
bottle
a
clear
acidulated
solution
of
acetate
of
lead
the
bottle
is
corked
a
piece
of
copper
wire
being
fastened
to
the
cork
from
which
wire
is
suspended
a
piece
of
zinc
the
latter
hanging
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
center
of
the
lead
solution
when
the
bottle
is
corked
the
copper
wire
immediately
begins
to
surround
itself
with
a
growth
of
metallic
lead
resembling
fine
moss
from
this
moss
spring
branches
and
limbs
which
in
turn
manifest
a
growth
similar
to
foliage
until
at
last
a
miniature
bush
or
tree
is
formed
similar
metallic
vegetation
may
be
produced
by
other
metallic
solutions
all
of
you
have
noticed
how
crystals
of
frost
form
on
window
panes
in
shapes
of
leaves
branches
foliage
flowers
blossoms
etc
saltpeter
when
subjected
to
the
effect
of
polarized
light
assumes
forms
closely
resembling
the
forms
of
the
orchid
nature
is
full
of
these
resemblances
a
german
scientist
recently
performed
a
remarkable
experiment
with
certain
metallic
salts
he
subjected
the
salts
to
the
action
of
a
galvanic
current
when
to
his
surprise
the
particles
of
the
salts
grouped
themselves
around
the
negative
pole
of
the
battery
and
then
grew
into
a
shape
closely
resembling
a
miniature
mushroom
with
tiny
stem
and
umbrella
top
these
metallic
mushrooms
at
first
presented
a
transparent
appearance
but
gradually
developed
color
the
top
of
the
umbrella
being
a
bright
red
with
a
faint
rose
shade
on
the
under
surface
the
stems
showed
a
pale
straw
color
this
was
most
interesting
but
the
important
fact
of
the
experiment
consists
in
the
discovery
that
these
mushrooms
have
fine
veins
or
tubes
running
along
the
stems
through
which
the
nourishment
or
additional
material
for
growth
is
transported
so
that
the
growth
is
actually
from
the
inside
just
as
is
the
case
with
fungus
life
to
all
intents
and
purposes
these
inorganic
metallic
growths
were
low
forms
of
vegetable
his
but
the
search
for
life
does
not
end
with
the
forms
of
the
mineral
world
as
we
know
them
science
has
separated
the
material
forms
into
smaller
forms
and
again
still
smaller
and
if
there
is
life
in
the
form
composed
of
countless
particles
then
must
there
be
life
in
the
particles
themselves
for
life
can
not
come
from
and
if
there
be
not
life
in
the
particles
the
theory
of
omnipresent
life
must
fan
so
we
must
look
beyond
the
form
and
shape
of
the
mineral
mist
separate
it
into
its
constituent
parts
and
then
examine
the
parts
for
indications
of
life
science
teaches
us
that
all
forms
of
matter
are
compiled
of
minute
particles
called
molecules
a
molecule
is
the
smallest
particle
of
matter
that
is
possible
unless
the
chemical
atoms
composing
the
matter
fly
apart
and
the
matter
be
resolved
into
its
original
elements
for
instance
let
us
take
the
familiar
instance
of
a
drop
of
water
let
us
divide
and
subdivide
the
drop
until
at
last
we
get
to
the
smallest
possible
particle
of
water
that
smallest
possible
particle
would
be
a
molecule
of
water
we
can
not
subdivide
this
molecule
without
causing
its
atoms
of
hydrogen
and
oxygen
to
fly
apart
and
then
there
would
be
no
at
all
well
these
molecules
manifest
a
something
called
attraction
for
each
other
they
attract
other
molecules
of
the
same
kind
and
are
likewise
attracted
the
operation
of
this
law
of
attraction
results
in
the
formation
of
masses
of
matter
whether
those
masses
be
mountains
of
solid
rock
or
a
drop
of
water
or
a
volume
of
gas
all
masses
of
matter
are
composed
of
aggregations
of
molecules
held
together
by
the
law
of
attraction
this
law
of
attraction
is
called
cohesion
this
cohesive
attraction
is
not
a
mere
mechanical
force
as
many
suppose
but
is
an
exhibition
of
life
action
manifesting
in
the
presence
of
the
molecule
of
a
like
or
love
for
the
similar
molecule
and
when
the
life
energies
begin
to
manifest
on
a
certain
plane
and
proceed
to
mould
the
molecules
into
crystals
so
that
we
may
see
the
actual
process
under
way
we
begin
to
realize
very
clearly
that
there
is
something
at
work
in
this
building
up
but
wonderful
as
this
may
seem
to
those
unfamiliar
with
the
idea
the
manifestation
of
life
among
the
atoms
is
still
more
so
the
atom
you
will
remember
is
the
chemical
unit
which
uniting
with
other
atoms
makes
up
the
molecule
for
instance
if
we
take
two
atoms
of
the
gas
called
hydrogen
and
one
atom
of
the
gas
called
oxygen
and
place
them
near
each
other
they
will
at
once
rush
toward
each
other
and
form
a
partnership
which
is
called
a
molecule
of
water
and
so
it
is
with
all
atoms
they
are
continually
forming
partnerships
or
dissolving
them
marriage
and
divorce
is
a
part
of
the
life
of
the
atoms
these
evidences
of
attraction
and
repulsion
among
the
atoms
are
receiving
much
attention
from
careful
thinkers
and
some
of
the
most
advanced
minds
of
the
age
see
in
this
phenomena
the
corroboration
of
the
old
yogi
idea
that
there
is
life
and
vital
action
in
the
smallest
particles
of
matter
the
atoms
manifest
vital
characteristics
in
their
attractions
and
repulsions
they
move
along
the
lines
of
their
attractions
and
form
marriages
and
thus
combining
they
form
the
substances
with
which
we
are
familiar
when
they
combine
remember
they
do
not
lose
their
individuality
and
melt
into
a
permanent
substance
but
merely
unite
and
yet
remain
distinct
if
the
combination
be
destroyed
by
chemical
action
electrical
discharge
the
atoms
fly
apart
and
again
live
their
own
separate
lives
until
they
come
in
contact
with
other
atoms
with
which
they
have
affinities
and
form
a
new
union
or
partnership
in
many
chemical
changes
the
atoms
divorce
themselves
each
forsaking
its
mate
or
mates
and
seeking
some
newer
affinity
in
the
shape
of
a
more
congenial
atom
the
atoms
manifest
a
fickleness
and
will
always
desert
a
lesser
attraction
for
a
greater
one
this
is
no
mere
bit
of
imagery
or
scientific
poetry
it
is
a
scientific
statement
of
the
action
of
atoms
along
the
lines
of
vital
manifestation
the
great
german
scientist
haekel
has
said
i
can
not
imagine
the
simplest
chemical
and
physical
processes
without
attributing
the
movement
of
the
material
particles
to
unconscious
sensation
the
idea
of
chemical
affinity
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
various
chemical
elements
perceive
differences
in
the
qualities
of
other
elements
and
experience
pleasure
or
revulsion
at
contact
with
them
and
execute
their
respective
movements
on
this
ground
he
also
says
we
may
ascribe
the
feeling
of
pleasure
or
pain
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction
to
all
atoms
and
thereby
ascribe
the
elective
affinities
of
chemistry
to
the
attraction
between
living
atoms
and
repulsion
between
hating
atoms
he
also
says
that
the
sensations
in
animal
and
plant
life
are
connected
by
a
long
series
of
evolutionary
stages
with
the
simpler
forms
of
sensation
that
we
find
in
the
inorganic
elements
and
that
reveal
themselves
in
chemical
affinity
naegli
says
if
the
molecules
possess
something
that
is
related
however
distantly
to
sensation
it
must
be
comfortable
for
them
to
be
able
to
follow
their
attractions
and
repulsions
and
uncomfortable
for
them
when
they
are
forced
to
do
otherwise
we
might
fill
page
after
page
with
quotations
from
eminent
thinkers
going
to
prove
the
correctness
of
the
old
yogi
teachings
that
life
is
omnipresent
modern
science
is
rapidly
advancing
to
this
position
leaving
behind
her
the
old
idea
of
dead
matter
even
the
new
theories
of
the
electron
the
little
particles
of
electrical
energy
which
are
now
believed
to
constitute
the
base
of
the
atom
does
not
change
this
idea
for
the
electrons
manifest
attraction
and
response
thereto
and
form
themselves
into
groups
composing
the
atom
and
even
if
we
pass
beyond
matter
into
the
mystical
ether
which
science
assumes
to
be
the
material
base
of
things
we
must
believe
that
there
is
life
there
too
and
that
as
dolbear
says
the
ether
has
besides
the
function
of
energy
and
motion
other
inherent
properties
out
of
which
could
emerge
under
proper
circumstances
other
phenomena
such
as
life
mind
or
whatever
may
be
in
the
substratum
and
that
as
prof
cope
has
hinted
that
the
basis
of
life
lies
back
of
the
atoms
and
may
be
found
in
the
universal
ether
some
scientists
go
even
further
and
assert
that
not
only
is
life
present
in
everything
but
that
mind
is
present
where
life
is
verily
the
dreams
of
the
yogi
fathers
are
coming
true
and
from
the
ranks
of
the
materialists
are
coming
the
material
proofs
of
the
spiritual
teachings
listen
to
these
words
from
saleeby
in
his
recent
valuable
scientific
work
the
master
he
says
life
is
potential
in
matter
is
not
a
thing
unique
and
created
at
a
particular
time
in
the
past
if
evolution
be
true
living
matter
has
been
evolved
by
natural
processes
from
matter
which
is
apparently
not
alive
but
if
life
is
potential
in
matter
it
is
a
thousand
times
more
evident
that
mind
is
potential
in
life
the
evolutionist
is
impelled
to
believe
that
mind
is
potential
in
matter
i
adopt
that
form
of
words
for
the
moment
but
not
without
future
criticism
the
microscopic
cell
a
minute
speck
of
matter
that
is
to
become
man
has
in
it
the
promise
and
the
germ
of
mind
may
we
not
then
draw
the
inference
that
the
elements
of
mind
are
present
in
those
chemical
elements
carbon
oxygen
hydrogen
nitrogen
sulphur
phosphorus
sodium
potassium
chlorine
that
are
found
in
the
cell
not
only
must
we
do
so
but
we
must
go
further
since
we
know
that
each
of
these
elements
and
every
other
is
built
up
out
of
one
invariable
unit
the
electron
and
we
must
therefore
assert
that
mind
is
potential
in
the
unit
of
matter
the
electron
itself
it
is
to
assert
the
sublime
truth
first
perceived
by
spinoza
that
mind
and
matter
are
the
warp
and
woof
of
what
goethe
called
living
garment
of
god
both
are
complementary
expressions
of
the
unknowable
reality
which
underlies
both
there
is
no
such
thing
as
attraction
or
repulsion
all
inclinations
for
or
against
another
object
or
thing
is
an
evidence
of
life
each
thing
has
sufficient
life
energy
to
enable
it
to
carry
on
its
work
and
as
each
form
advances
by
evolution
into
a
higher
form
it
is
able
to
have
more
of
the
life
energy
manifest
through
it
as
its
material
machinery
is
built
up
it
becomes
able
to
manifest
a
greater
and
higher
degree
of
life
it
is
not
that
one
thing
has
a
low
life
or
another
a
high
life
this
can
not
be
for
there
is
but
one
life
it
is
like
the
current
of
electricity
that
is
able
to
run
the
most
delicate
machinery
or
manifest
a
light
in
the
incandescent
lamp
give
it
the
organ
or
machinery
of
manifestation
and
it
manifests
give
it
a
low
form
and
it
will
manifest
a
low
degree
give
it
a
high
form
and
it
will
manifest
a
high
degree
the
same
steam
power
runs
the
clumsy
engine
or
the
perfect
apparatus
which
drives
the
most
delicate
mechanism
and
so
it
is
with
the
one
life
its
manifestations
may
seem
low
and
clumsy
or
high
and
perfect
but
it
all
depends
upon
the
material
or
mental
machinery
through
which
it
works
there
is
but
one
life
manifesting
in
countless
forms
and
shapes
and
degrees
one
life
underlying
all
in
all
from
the
highest
forms
of
life
down
through
the
animal
vegetable
and
mineral
kingdoms
we
see
life
everywhere
present
death
an
illusion
back
of
all
visible
forms
of
material
life
there
is
still
the
beginnings
of
manifested
life
pressing
forward
for
expression
and
manifestation
and
underneath
all
is
the
spirit
of
life
longing
striving
feeling
acting
in
the
mountain
and
the
ocean
the
flower
and
the
tree
the
sunset
the
dawn
the
suns
the
stars
all
is
life
manifestations
of
the
one
life
everything
is
alive
quick
with
living
force
power
action
thrilling
with
vitality
throbbing
with
feeling
filled
with
activity
all
is
from
the
one
life
and
all
that
is
from
the
one
life
is
alive
there
is
no
dead
substance
in
the
universe
there
can
be
none
for
life
can
not
die
all
is
alive
and
life
is
in
all
carry
with
you
this
central
thought
of
the
lesson
central
thought
is
but
one
life
and
its
manifestations
comprise
all
the
forms
and
shapes
of
the
universe
from
life
comes
but
life
and
life
can
come
only
from
life
therefore
we
have
the
right
to
expect
that
all
manifestations
of
the
one
life
should
be
alive
and
we
are
not
mocked
in
such
belief
not
only
do
the
highest
occult
teachings
inform
us
that
everything
is
alive
but
modern
science
has
proven
to
us
that
life
is
present
everywhere
even
in
that
which
was
formerly
considered
dead
matter
it
now
sees
that
even
the
atom
and
what
lies
back
of
the
atom
is
charged
with
life
energy
and
action
forms
and
shapes
may
change
and
do
change
but
life
remains
eternal
and
infinite
it
can
not
die
for
it
is
peace
be
with
thee
the
third
lesson
the
creative
will
in
our
first
lesson
of
this
series
we
stated
that
among
the
other
qualities
and
attributes
that
we
were
compelled
by
the
laws
of
our
reason
to
think
that
the
absolute
possessed
was
that
of
omnipotence
or
in
other
words
we
are
compelled
to
think
of
the
one
as
being
the
source
and
fount
of
all
the
power
there
is
ever
has
been
or
ever
can
be
in
the
universe
not
only
as
is
generally
supposed
that
the
power
of
the
one
is
greater
than
any
other
power
but
more
than
this
that
there
can
be
no
other
power
and
that
therefore
each
and
every
any
and
all
manifestations
or
forms
of
power
force
or
energy
must
be
a
part
of
the
great
one
energy
which
emanates
from
the
one
there
is
no
escape
from
this
conclusion
as
startling
as
it
may
appear
to
the
mind
unaccustomed
to
it
if
there
is
any
power
not
from
and
of
the
one
from
whence
comes
such
power
for
there
is
nothing
else
outside
of
the
one
who
or
what
exists
outside
of
the
one
that
can
manifest
even
the
faintest
degree
of
power
of
any
kind
all
power
must
come
from
the
absolute
and
must
in
its
nature
be
but
one
modern
science
has
recognized
this
truth
and
one
of
its
fundamental
principles
is
the
unity
of
energy
the
theory
that
all
forms
of
energy
are
at
the
last
one
science
holds
that
all
forms
of
energy
are
interchangeable
and
from
this
idea
comes
the
theory
of
the
conservation
of
energy
or
correlation
of
force
science
teaches
that
every
manifestation
of
energy
power
or
force
from
the
operation
of
the
law
of
gravitation
up
to
the
highest
form
of
mental
force
is
but
the
operation
of
the
one
energy
of
the
universe
just
what
this
energy
is
in
its
inner
nature
science
does
not
know
it
has
many
theories
but
does
not
advance
any
of
them
as
a
law
it
speaks
of
the
infinite
and
eternal
energy
from
which
all
things
proceed
but
pronounces
its
nature
to
be
unknowable
but
some
of
the
scientists
are
veering
around
to
the
teachings
of
the
occultists
and
are
now
hinting
that
it
is
something
more
than
a
mere
mechanical
energy
they
are
speaking
of
it
in
terms
of
mind
wundt
the
german
scientist
whose
school
of
thought
is
called
voluntarism
considers
the
of
energy
to
be
something
that
may
be
called
will
crusius
as
far
back
as
said
will
is
the
dominating
force
of
the
world
and
schopenhauer
based
his
fascinating
but
gloomy
philosophy
and
metaphysics
upon
the
underlying
principle
of
an
active
form
of
energy
which
he
called
the
which
he
considered
to
be
the
or
the
absolute
balzac
the
novelist
considered
a
something
akin
to
will
to
be
the
moving
force
of
the
universe
bulwer
advanced
a
similar
theory
and
made
mention
of
it
in
several
of
his
novels
this
idea
of
an
active
creative
will
at
work
in
the
universe
building
up
tearing
down
replacing
repairing
changing
always
at
work
ever
active
has
been
entertained
by
numerous
philosophers
and
thinkers
under
different
names
and
styles
some
like
schopenhauer
have
thought
of
this
will
as
the
final
thing
that
which
took
the
place
of
god
the
first
cause
but
others
have
seen
in
this
will
an
active
living
principle
emanating
from
the
absolute
or
god
and
working
in
accordance
with
the
laws
impressed
by
him
upon
it
in
various
forms
this
latter
idea
is
seen
all
through
the
history
of
philosophical
thought
cudsworth
the
english
philosopher
evolved
the
idea
of
a
something
called
the
plastic
nature
which
so
closely
approaches
the
yogi
idea
of
the
creative
will
that
we
feel
justified
in
quoting
a
passage
from
his
book
he
says
it
seems
not
so
agreeable
to
reason
that
nature
as
a
distinct
thing
from
the
deity
should
be
quite
superseded
or
made
to
signify
nothing
god
himself
doing
all
things
immediately
and
miraculously
from
whence
it
would
follow
also
that
they
are
all
done
either
forcibly
and
violently
or
else
artificially
only
and
none
of
them
by
any
inward
principle
of
their
own
this
opinion
is
further
confuted
by
that
slow
and
gradual
process
that
in
the
generation
of
things
which
would
seem
to
be
but
a
vain
and
idle
pomp
or
a
trifling
formality
if
the
moving
power
were
omnipotent
as
also
by
those
errors
and
bungles
which
are
committed
where
the
matter
is
inept
and
contumacious
which
argue
that
the
moving
power
be
not
irresistible
and
that
nature
is
such
a
thing
as
is
not
altogether
incapable
as
well
as
human
art
of
being
sometimes
frustrated
and
disappointed
by
the
indisposition
of
matter
whereas
an
omnipotent
moving
power
as
it
could
dispatch
its
work
in
a
moment
so
would
it
always
do
it
infallibly
and
irresistibly
no
ineptitude
and
stubbornness
of
matter
being
ever
able
to
hinder
such
a
one
or
make
him
bungle
or
fumble
in
anything
wherefore
since
neither
all
things
are
produced
fortuitously
or
by
the
unguided
mechanism
of
matter
nor
god
himself
may
be
reasonably
thought
to
do
all
things
immediately
and
miraculously
it
may
well
be
concluded
that
there
is
a
plastic
nature
under
him
which
as
an
inferior
and
subordinate
instrument
doth
drudgingly
execute
that
part
of
his
providence
which
consists
in
the
regular
and
orderly
motion
of
matter
yet
so
as
there
is
also
besides
this
a
higher
providence
to
be
acknowledged
which
presiding
over
it
doth
often
supply
the
defects
of
it
and
sometimes
overrules
it
forasmuch
as
the
plastic
nature
can
not
act
electively
nor
with
discretion
the
yogi
philosophy
teaches
of
the
existence
of
a
universal
creative
will
emanating
from
the
absolute
infilled
with
the
power
of
the
absolute
and
acting
under
established
natural
laws
which
performs
the
active
work
of
creation
in
the
world
similar
to
that
performed
by
cudsworth
plastic
nature
just
mentioned
this
creative
will
is
not
schopenhauer
it
is
not
a
but
a
vehicle
or
instrument
of
the
absolute
it
is
an
emanation
of
the
mind
of
the
absolute
a
manifestation
in
action
of
its
will
a
mental
product
rather
than
a
physical
and
of
course
saturated
with
the
of
its
projector
this
creative
will
is
not
a
mere
blind
mechanical
energy
or
force
it
is
far
more
than
this
we
can
explain
it
only
by
referring
you
to
the
manifestation
of
the
will
in
yourself
you
wish
to
move
your
arm
and
it
moves
the
immediate
force
may
seem
to
be
a
mechanical
force
but
what
is
back
of
that
force
what
is
the
essence
of
the
force
the
will
all
manifestations
of
energy
all
the
causes
of
motion
all
forces
are
forms
of
the
action
of
the
will
of
the
one
the
creative
will
acting
under
natural
laws
established
by
the
one
ever
moving
acting
forcing
urging
driving
leading
we
do
not
mean
that
every
little
act
is
a
thought
of
the
moment
on
the
part
of
the
absolute
and
a
reaching
out
of
the
will
in
obedience
to
that
thought
on
the
contrary
we
mean
that
the
one
set
the
will
into
operation
as
a
whole
conceiving
of
laws
and
limitations
in
its
action
the
will
constantly
operating
in
obedience
to
that
conception
the
results
manifesting
in
what
we
call
natural
law
natural
forces
etc
besides
this
the
absolute
is
believed
to
manifest
its
will
specially
upon
occasions
and
moreover
permits
its
will
to
be
applied
and
used
by
the
individual
wills
of
individual
egos
under
the
general
law
and
laws
and
plan
of
the
one
but
you
must
not
suppose
that
the
will
is
manifested
only
in
the
form
of
mechanical
forces
cohesion
chemical
attraction
electricity
gravitation
etc
it
does
more
than
this
it
is
in
full
operation
in
all
forms
of
life
and
living
things
it
is
present
everywhere
back
of
all
forms
of
movement
and
action
we
find
a
moving
cause
usually
a
this
is
true
of
that
which
we
have
been
calling
mechanical
forces
and
of
all
forms
of
that
which
we
call
life
energy
now
note
this
this
great
pressure
that
you
will
observe
in
all
life
action
is
the
creative
will
the
will
principle
of
the
one
bending
toward
the
carrying
out
of
the
great
plan
of
life
look
where
we
will
on
living
forms
and
we
may
begin
to
recognize
the
presence
of
a
certain
creative
energy
at
work
building
up
moulding
directing
tearing
down
replacing
always
active
in
its
efforts
to
create
preserve
and
conserve
life
this
visible
creative
energy
is
what
the
yogi
philosophy
calls
the
creative
will
and
which
forms
the
subject
of
this
lesson
the
creative
will
is
that
striving
longing
pressing
forward
unfolding
progressing
evolutionary
effort
that
all
thoughtful
people
see
in
operation
in
all
forms
of
life
throughout
all
nature
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
forms
of
life
the
effort
energy
pressure
may
be
recognized
in
action
creating
preserving
nourishing
and
improving
its
forms
it
is
that
something
that
we
recognize
when
we
speak
of
nature
forces
at
work
in
plant
growth
and
animal
functioning
if
you
will
but
keep
the
word
and
idea
nature
before
you
you
will
be
able
to
more
clearly
form
the
mental
concept
of
the
creative
will
the
creative
will
is
that
which
you
have
been
calling
nature
at
work
in
the
growth
of
the
plant
the
sprouting
of
the
seed
the
curling
and
reaching
of
the
tendril
the
fertilization
of
the
blossoms
etc
you
have
seen
this
will
at
work
if
you
have
watched
growing
things
we
call
this
energy
the
creative
will
because
it
is
the
objective
manifestation
of
the
creative
energy
of
the
absolute
its
visible
will
manifested
in
the
direction
of
physical
life
it
is
as
much
will
in
action
as
the
will
that
causes
your
arm
to
move
in
response
to
its
power
it
is
no
mere
chance
thing
or
mechanical
law
it
is
life
action
in
operation
this
creative
will
not
only
causes
movement
in
completed
life
but
all
movement
and
action
in
life
independent
of
the
personal
will
of
its
individual
forms
all
the
phenomena
of
the
unconscious
belong
to
it
it
causes
the
body
to
grow
attends
to
the
details
of
nourishment
assimilation
digestion
elimination
and
all
of
the
rest
it
builds
up
bodies
organs
and
parts
and
keeps
them
in
operation
and
function
the
creative
will
is
directed
to
the
outward
expression
of
life
to
the
objectification
of
life
you
may
call
this
energy
the
universal
life
energy
if
you
wish
but
to
those
who
know
it
it
is
a
will
an
active
living
will
in
full
operation
and
power
pressing
forward
toward
the
manifestation
of
objective
life
the
creative
will
seems
to
be
filled
with
a
strong
desire
to
manifest
it
longs
to
express
itself
and
to
give
birth
to
forms
of
activity
desire
lies
under
and
in
all
forms
of
its
manifestations
the
ever
present
desire
of
the
creative
will
causes
lower
forms
to
be
succeeded
by
higher
forms
and
is
the
moving
cause
of
evolution
it
is
the
evolutionary
urge
itself
which
ever
cries
to
its
manifestations
move
on
move
upward
in
the
hindu
classic
the
mahabarata
brahma
created
the
most
beautiful
female
being
ever
known
and
called
her
tillotama
he
presented
her
in
turn
to
all
the
gods
in
order
to
witness
their
wonder
and
admiration
siva
desire
to
behold
her
was
so
great
that
it
developed
in
him
four
faces
in
succession
as
she
made
the
tour
of
the
assembly
and
indra
longing
was
so
intense
that
his
body
became
all
eyes
in
this
myth
may
be
seen
exemplified
the
effect
of
desire
and
will
in
the
forms
of
life
function
and
shape
all
following
desire
and
need
as
in
the
case
of
the
long
neck
of
the
giraffe
which
enables
him
to
reach
for
the
high
branches
of
the
trees
in
his
native
land
and
in
the
long
neck
and
high
legs
of
the
fisher
birds
the
crane
stork
ibis
etc
the
creative
will
finds
within
itself
a
desire
to
create
suns
and
they
are
formed
it
desired
planets
to
revolve
around
the
suns
and
they
were
thrown
off
in
obedience
to
the
law
it
desired
plant
life
and
plant
life
appeared
working
from
higher
to
lower
form
then
came
animal
life
from
nomad
to
man
some
of
the
animal
forms
yielded
to
the
desire
to
fly
and
wings
appeared
gradually
and
we
called
it
some
felt
a
desire
to
burrow
in
the
ground
and
lo
came
the
moles
gophers
etc
it
wanted
a
thinking
creature
and
man
with
his
wonderful
brain
was
evolved
evolution
is
more
than
a
mere
survival
of
the
fittest
natural
selection
etc
although
it
uses
these
laws
as
tools
and
instruments
still
back
of
them
is
that
insistent
urge
that
desire
that
creative
will
lamark
was
nearer
right
than
darwin
when
he
claimed
that
desire
was
back
of
it
all
and
preceded
function
and
form
desire
wanted
form
and
function
and
produced
them
by
the
activity
of
the
creative
will
this
creative
will
acts
like
a
living
force
and
so
it
is
indeed
but
it
does
not
act
as
a
reasoning
intellectual
something
in
one
sense
instead
it
manifests
rather
the
feeling
wanting
longing
instinctive
phase
of
mind
akin
to
those
feelings
and
resulting
actions
that
we
find
within
our
natures
the
will
acts
on
the
instinctive
plane
evolution
shows
us
life
constantly
pressing
forward
toward
higher
and
still
higher
forms
of
expression
the
urge
is
constantly
upward
and
onward
it
is
true
that
some
species
sink
out
of
sight
their
work
in
the
world
having
been
done
but
they
are
succeeded
by
other
species
more
in
harmony
with
their
environment
and
the
needs
of
their
times
some
races
of
men
decay
but
others
build
on
their
foundations
and
reach
still
greater
heights
the
creative
will
is
something
different
from
reason
or
intellect
but
it
underlies
these
in
the
lower
forms
of
life
in
which
mind
is
in
but
small
evidence
the
will
is
in
active
operation
manifesting
in
instinct
and
automatic
life
action
so
called
it
does
not
depend
upon
brains
for
manifestation
for
these
lowly
forms
of
life
have
no
brains
but
is
in
operation
through
every
part
of
the
body
of
the
living
thing
evidences
of
the
existence
of
the
creative
will
acting
independently
of
the
brains
of
animal
and
plant
life
may
be
had
in
overwhelming
quantity
if
we
will
but
examine
the
life
action
in
the
lower
forms
of
life
the
testimony
of
the
investigators
along
the
lines
of
the
evolutionary
school
of
thought
show
us
that
the
life
principle
was
in
active
operation
in
lowly
animal
and
plant
life
millions
of
years
before
brains
capable
of
manifesting
thought
were
produced
haekel
informs
us
that
during
more
than
half
of
the
enormous
time
that
has
elapsed
since
organic
life
first
became
evident
no
animal
sufficiently
advanced
to
have
a
brain
was
in
existence
brains
were
evolved
according
to
the
law
of
desire
or
necessity
in
accordance
with
the
great
plan
but
they
were
not
needed
for
carrying
on
the
wonderful
work
of
the
creation
and
preservation
of
the
living
forms
and
they
are
not
today
the
tiny
infant
and
the
senseless
idiot
are
not
able
to
think
intelligently
but
still
their
life
functions
go
on
regularly
and
according
to
law
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
thinking
brains
and
the
life
work
of
the
plants
and
of
the
lowly
forms
of
animal
life
is
carried
on
likewise
this
wonderful
thing
that
we
call
instinct
is
but
another
name
for
the
manifestation
of
the
creative
will
which
flows
from
the
one
life
or
the
absolute
even
as
far
down
the
scale
of
life
as
the
monera
we
may
see
the
creative
will
in
action
the
monera
are
but
tiny
bits
of
slimy
substances
mere
specks
of
glue
without
organs
of
any
kind
and
yet
they
exercise
the
organic
phenomena
of
life
such
as
nutrition
reproduction
sensation
and
movement
all
of
which
are
usually
associated
with
an
organized
structure
these
creatures
are
incapable
of
thought
in
themselves
and
the
phenomenon
is
due
to
the
action
of
the
will
through
them
this
instinctive
impulse
and
action
is
seen
everywhere
manifesting
upon
higher
and
still
higher
lines
as
higher
forms
of
organisms
are
built
up
scientists
have
used
the
term
appetency
defining
it
as
the
instinctive
tendency
of
living
organisms
to
perform
certain
actions
the
tendency
of
an
unorganized
body
to
seek
that
which
satisfies
the
wants
of
its
organism
now
what
is
this
tendency
it
can
not
be
an
effort
of
reason
for
the
low
form
of
life
has
nothing
with
which
to
reason
and
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
purposive
tendency
without
assuming
the
existence
of
mental
power
of
some
kind
and
where
can
such
a
power
be
located
if
not
in
the
form
itself
when
we
consider
that
the
will
is
acting
in
and
through
all
forms
of
life
from
highest
to
lowest
from
moneron
to
man
we
can
at
once
recognize
the
source
of
the
power
and
activity
it
is
the
great
life
principle
the
creative
will
manifesting
itself
we
can
perhaps
better
form
an
idea
of
the
creative
will
by
reference
to
its
outward
and
visible
forms
of
activity
we
can
not
see
the
will
itself
the
pressure
and
the
urge
but
we
can
see
its
action
through
living
forms
just
as
we
can
not
see
a
man
behind
a
curtain
and
yet
may
practically
see
him
by
watching
the
movements
of
his
form
as
he
presses
up
against
the
curtain
so
may
we
see
the
will
by
watching
it
as
it
presses
up
against
the
living
curtain
of
the
forms
of
life
there
was
a
play
presented
on
the
american
stage
a
few
years
ago
in
which
one
of
the
scenes
pictured
the
place
of
departed
spirits
according
to
the
japanese
belief
the
audience
could
not
see
the
actors
representing
the
spirits
but
they
could
see
their
movements
as
they
pressed
up
close
to
a
thin
silky
curtain
stretched
across
the
stage
and
their
motions
as
they
moved
to
and
fro
behind
the
curtain
were
plainly
recognized
the
deception
was
perfect
and
the
effect
was
startling
one
almost
believed
that
he
saw
the
forms
of
formless
creatures
and
this
is
what
we
may
do
in
viewing
the
operation
of
the
creative
will
we
may
take
a
look
at
the
moving
form
of
the
will
behind
the
curtain
of
the
forms
of
the
manifestation
of
life
we
may
see
it
pressing
and
urging
here
and
bending
there
building
up
here
and
changing
there
always
acting
always
moving
striving
doing
in
response
to
that
insatiable
urge
and
craving
and
longing
of
its
inner
desire
let
us
take
a
few
peeps
at
the
will
moving
behind
the
curtain
commencing
with
the
cases
of
the
forming
of
the
crystals
as
spoken
of
in
our
last
lesson
we
may
pass
on
to
plant
life
but
before
doing
so
it
may
be
well
for
us
to
take
a
parting
look
at
the
will
manifesting
crystal
forms
one
of
the
latest
scientific
works
makes
mention
of
the
experiments
of
a
scientist
who
has
been
devoting
much
attention
to
the
formation
of
crystals
and
reports
that
he
has
noticed
that
certain
crystals
of
organic
compounds
instead
of
being
built
up
symmetrically
as
is
usual
with
crystals
were
that
is
opposed
to
each
other
in
rights
and
lefts
like
hands
or
gloves
or
shoes
etc
these
crystals
are
never
found
alone
but
always
form
in
pairs
can
you
not
see
the
will
behind
the
curtain
here
let
us
look
for
the
will
in
passing
rapidly
over
the
wonderful
evidences
in
the
cases
of
the
fertilization
of
plants
by
insects
the
plant
shaping
its
blossom
so
as
to
admit
the
entrance
of
the
particular
insect
that
acts
as
the
carrier
of
its
pollen
think
for
a
moment
how
the
distribution
of
the
seed
is
provided
for
fruit
trees
and
plants
surround
the
seed
with
a
sweet
covering
that
it
may
be
eaten
by
insect
and
animal
and
the
seed
distributed
others
have
a
hard
covering
to
protect
the
seed
or
nut
from
the
winter
frosts
but
which
covering
rots
with
the
spring
rains
and
allows
the
germ
to
sprout
others
surround
the
seed
with
a
fleecy
substance
so
that
the
wind
may
carry
it
here
and
there
and
give
it
a
chance
to
find
a
home
where
it
is
not
so
crowded
another
tree
has
a
little
arrangement
by
means
of
which
it
pops
its
seed
to
a
distance
of
several
feet
other
plants
have
seeds
that
are
covered
with
a
burr
or
sticky
bristles
which
enables
them
to
attach
themselves
to
the
wool
of
sheep
and
other
animals
and
thus
be
carried
about
and
finally
dropped
in
some
spot
far
away
from
the
parent
plant
and
thus
the
scattering
of
the
species
be
accomplished
some
plants
show
the
most
wonderful
plans
and
arrangements
for
this
scattering
of
the
seed
in
new
homes
where
there
is
a
better
opportunity
for
growth
and
development
the
arrangements
for
this
purpose
displaying
something
very
much
akin
to
what
we
would
call
ingenuity
if
it
were
the
work
of
a
reasoning
mind
there
are
plants
called
whose
are
provided
with
stickers
in
every
direction
so
that
anything
brushing
against
them
is
sure
to
pick
them
up
at
the
end
of
each
sticker
is
a
very
tiny
hook
and
these
hooks
fasten
themselves
tightly
into
anything
that
brushes
against
it
animal
wool
hair
or
clothing
etc
some
of
these
seeds
have
been
known
to
have
been
carried
to
other
quarters
of
the
globe
in
wool
there
to
find
new
homes
and
a
wider
field
other
plants
like
the
thistle
provide
their
seed
with
downy
wings
by
which
the
wind
carries
them
afar
to
other
fields
other
seeds
have
a
faculty
of
tumbling
and
rolling
along
the
ground
to
great
distances
owing
to
their
peculiar
shape
and
formation
the
maple
provides
its
seed
with
a
peculiar
arrangement
something
like
a
propeller
screw
which
when
the
wind
strikes
the
trees
and
looses
the
seed
whirls
the
latter
through
the
air
to
a
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
or
more
other
seeds
are
provided
with
floating
apparatus
which
enables
them
to
travel
many
miles
by
stream
or
river
or
rain
washes
some
of
these
not
only
float
but
actually
swim
having
filaments
which
wriggle
like
legs
and
actually
propel
the
tiny
seed
along
to
its
new
home
a
recent
writer
says
of
these
seeds
that
so
curiously
lifelike
are
their
movements
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
these
tiny
objects
making
good
progress
through
the
water
are
really
seeds
and
not
insects
the
leaves
of
the
venus
fold
upon
each
other
and
enclose
the
insect
which
is
attracted
by
the
sweet
juice
on
the
leaf
three
extremely
sensitive
bristles
or
hairs
giving
the
plant
notice
that
the
insect
is
touching
them
a
recent
writer
gives
the
following
description
of
a
peculiar
plant
he
says
on
the
shores
of
lake
nicaragua
is
to
be
found
an
uncanny
product
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
known
among
the
natives
by
the
expressive
name
of
devil
noose
dunstan
the
naturalist
discovered
it
long
ago
while
wandering
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
attracted
by
the
cries
of
pain
and
terror
from
his
dog
he
found
the
animal
held
by
black
sticky
bands
which
had
chafed
the
skin
to
bleeding
point
these
bands
were
branches
of
a
carnivorous
plant
which
had
been
aptly
named
the
octopus
the
branches
are
flexible
black
polished
and
without
leaves
and
secrete
a
viscid
fluid
you
have
seen
flowers
that
closed
when
you
touched
them
you
remember
the
golden
poppy
that
closes
when
the
sun
goes
down
another
plant
a
variety
of
orchid
has
a
long
slender
flat
stem
or
tube
about
of
an
inch
thick
with
an
opening
at
the
extreme
end
and
a
series
of
fine
tubes
where
it
joins
the
plant
ordinarily
this
tube
remains
coiled
up
into
a
spiral
but
when
the
plant
needs
water
it
usually
grows
upon
the
trunks
of
trees
overhanging
swampy
places
it
slowly
uncoils
the
little
tube
and
bends
it
over
until
it
dips
into
the
water
when
it
proceeds
to
suck
up
the
water
until
it
is
filled
when
it
slowly
coils
around
and
discharges
the
water
directly
upon
the
plant
or
its
roots
then
it
repeats
the
process
until
the
plant
is
satisfied
when
the
water
is
absent
from
under
the
plant
the
tube
moves
this
way
and
that
way
until
it
finds
what
it
wants
just
like
the
trunk
of
an
elephant
if
one
touches
the
tube
or
trunk
of
the
plant
while
it
is
extended
for
water
it
shows
a
great
sensitiveness
and
rapidly
coils
itself
up
now
what
causes
this
life
action
the
plant
has
no
brains
and
can
not
have
reasoned
out
this
process
nor
even
have
acted
upon
them
by
reasoning
processes
it
has
nothing
to
think
with
to
such
a
high
degree
it
is
the
will
behind
the
curtain
moving
this
way
and
that
way
and
doing
things
there
was
once
a
french
scientist
named
duhamel
he
planted
some
beans
in
a
cylinder
something
like
a
long
tomato
can
lying
on
its
side
he
waited
until
the
beans
began
to
sprout
and
send
forth
roots
downward
and
shoots
upward
according
to
nature
invariable
rule
then
he
moved
the
cylinder
a
little
rolled
it
over
an
inch
or
two
the
next
day
he
rolled
it
over
a
little
more
and
so
on
each
day
rolling
it
over
a
little
each
time
well
after
a
time
duhamel
shook
the
dirt
and
growing
beans
out
of
the
cylinder
and
what
did
he
find
this
that
the
beans
in
their
endeavor
to
grow
their
roots
downward
had
kept
on
bending
each
day
downward
and
in
their
endeavor
to
send
shoots
upward
had
kept
on
bending
upward
a
little
each
day
until
at
last
there
had
been
formed
two
complete
spirals
the
one
spiral
being
the
roots
ever
turning
downward
and
the
other
the
shoots
ever
bending
upward
how
did
the
plant
know
direction
what
was
the
moving
power
the
creative
will
behind
the
curtain
again
you
see
potatoes
in
dark
cellars
have
sent
out
roots
or
sprouts
twenty
and
thirty
feet
to
reach
light
plants
will
send
out
roots
many
feet
to
reach
water
they
know
where
the
water
and
light
are
and
where
to
reach
them
the
tendrils
of
a
plant
know
where
the
stake
or
cord
is
and
they
reach
out
for
it
and
twine
themselves
around
it
unwind
them
and
the
next
day
they
are
found
again
twined
around
it
move
the
stake
or
cord
and
the
tendril
moves
after
it
the
plants
are
able
to
distinguish
between
nitrogenous
and
food
accepting
the
one
and
rejecting
the
other
they
recognize
that
cheese
has
the
same
nourishing
properties
as
the
insect
and
they
accept
it
although
it
is
far
different
in
feeling
taste
appearance
and
every
other
characteristic
from
their
accustomed
food
case
after
case
might
be
mentioned
and
cited
to
show
the
operation
of
the
will
in
but
wonderful
as
are
many
of
these
cases
the
mere
action
of
the
will
as
shown
in
the
of
the
plant
is
just
as
wonderful
just
imagine
a
tiny
seed
and
see
it
sprout
and
draw
to
itself
the
nourishment
from
water
air
light
and
soil
then
upward
until
it
becomes
a
great
tree
with
bark
limbs
branches
leaves
blossoms
fruit
and
all
think
of
this
miracle
and
consider
what
must
be
the
power
and
nature
of
that
will
that
causes
it
the
growing
plant
manifests
sufficient
strength
to
crack
great
stones
and
lift
great
slabs
of
pavement
as
may
be
noticed
by
examining
the
sidewalks
of
suburban
towns
and
parks
an
english
paper
prints
a
report
of
four
enormous
mushrooms
having
lifted
a
huge
slab
of
paving
stone
in
a
crowded
street
overnight
think
of
this
exhibition
of
energy
and
power
this
wonderful
faculty
of
exerting
force
and
motion
and
energy
is
fundamental
in
the
will
for
indeed
every
physical
change
and
growth
is
the
result
of
motion
and
motion
arises
only
from
force
and
pressure
whose
force
energy
power
and
motion
the
will
on
all
sides
of
us
we
may
see
this
constant
and
steady
urge
and
pressure
behind
living
forces
and
inorganic
forms
as
well
always
a
manifestation
of
energy
and
power
and
all
this
power
is
in
the
will
and
the
will
is
but
the
manifestation
of
the
the
absolute
remember
this
and
this
power
manifests
itself
not
only
in
the
matter
of
growth
and
ordinary
movements
but
also
in
some
other
ways
that
seem
quite
mysterious
to
even
modern
science
how
is
it
that
certain
birds
are
able
to
fly
directly
against
a
strong
wind
without
visible
movement
of
their
wings
how
do
the
buzzards
float
in
the
air
and
make
speed
without
a
motion
of
the
wing
what
is
the
explanation
of
the
movements
of
certain
microscopic
creatures
who
lack
organs
of
movement
listen
to
this
instance
related
by
the
scientist
benet
he
states
that
the
polycystids
have
a
most
peculiar
manner
of
moving
a
sort
of
sliding
motion
to
the
right
or
left
upward
backward
sideways
stopping
and
starting
fast
or
slow
as
it
wills
it
has
no
locomotive
organs
and
no
movement
can
be
seen
to
take
place
in
the
body
from
within
or
without
it
simply
slides
how
passing
on
to
the
higher
animal
life
how
do
eggs
grow
into
chickens
what
is
the
power
in
the
germ
of
the
egg
can
the
germ
think
and
plan
and
move
and
grow
into
a
chicken
or
is
the
will
at
work
there
and
what
is
true
in
this
case
is
true
of
the
birth
and
growth
of
all
animal
life
all
animal
life
develops
from
a
single
germ
cell
how
and
why
there
is
a
mental
energy
resident
in
the
germ
cell
of
this
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
that
mental
energy
is
the
creative
will
ever
manifesting
listen
to
these
words
from
huxley
the
eminent
scientist
he
says
the
student
of
nature
wonders
the
more
and
is
astonished
the
less
the
more
conversant
he
becomes
with
her
operations
but
of
all
the
perennial
miracles
she
offers
to
his
inspection
perhaps
the
most
worthy
of
his
admiration
is
the
development
of
a
plant
or
of
an
animal
from
its
embryo
examine
the
recently
laid
egg
of
some
common
animal
such
as
a
salamander
or
a
newt
it
is
a
minute
spheroid
in
which
the
best
microscope
will
reveal
nothing
but
a
structureless
sac
enclosing
a
glairy
fluid
holding
granules
in
suspension
but
strange
possibilities
lie
dormant
in
that
globule
let
a
moderate
supply
of
warmth
reach
its
watery
cradle
and
the
plastic
matter
undergoes
changes
so
rapid
and
so
purposelike
in
their
succession
that
one
can
only
compare
them
to
those
operated
by
a
skilled
modeller
upon
a
formless
lump
of
clay
as
with
an
invisible
trowel
the
mass
is
divided
and
subdivided
into
smaller
and
smaller
portions
until
it
is
reduced
to
an
aggregation
of
granules
not
too
large
to
build
withal
the
finest
fabrics
of
the
nascent
organism
and
then
it
is
as
if
a
delicate
finger
traced
out
the
line
to
be
occupied
by
the
spinal
column
and
moulded
the
contour
of
the
body
pinching
up
the
head
at
one
end
the
tail
at
the
other
and
fashioning
flank
and
limb
into
due
salamanderine
proportions
in
so
artistic
a
way
that
after
watching
the
process
hour
by
hour
one
is
almost
involuntarily
possessed
by
the
notion
that
some
more
subtle
aid
to
vision
than
the
achromatic
lens
would
show
the
hidden
artist
with
his
plan
before
him
striving
with
skilful
manipulation
to
perfect
his
work
as
life
advances
and
the
young
amphibian
ranges
the
waters
the
terror
of
his
insect
contemporaries
not
only
are
the
nutritious
particles
supplied
by
its
prey
by
the
addition
of
which
to
its
frame
growth
takes
place
laid
down
each
in
its
proper
spot
and
in
due
proportion
to
the
rest
as
to
reproduce
the
form
the
color
and
the
size
characteristic
of
the
parental
stock
but
even
the
wonderful
powers
of
reproducing
lost
parts
possessed
by
these
animals
are
controlled
by
the
same
governing
tendency
cut
off
the
legs
the
tail
the
jaws
separately
or
all
together
and
as
spallanzani
showed
long
ago
these
parts
not
only
grow
again
but
the
new
limb
is
formed
on
the
same
type
as
those
which
were
lost
the
new
jaw
or
leg
is
a
newt
and
never
by
any
accident
more
like
that
of
a
frog
in
this
passage
from
huxley
one
may
see
the
actual
working
of
the
creative
will
of
the
universe
moving
behind
the
curtain
and
a
very
thin
curtain
at
that
and
this
wonderful
work
is
going
on
all
around
us
all
the
time
miracles
are
being
accomplished
every
second
they
are
so
common
that
we
fail
to
regard
them
and
in
our
bodies
is
the
will
at
work
most
certainly
what
built
you
up
from
single
cell
to
maturity
did
you
do
it
with
your
intellect
has
not
every
bit
of
it
been
done
without
your
conscious
knowledge
it
is
only
when
things
go
wrong
owing
to
the
violation
of
some
law
that
you
become
aware
of
your
internal
organs
and
yet
stomach
and
liver
and
heart
and
the
rest
have
been
performing
their
work
steadily
working
away
day
and
night
building
up
repairing
nourishing
growing
you
into
a
man
or
woman
and
keeping
you
sound
and
strong
are
you
doing
this
with
your
reason
or
with
your
personal
will
no
it
is
the
great
creative
will
of
the
universe
universe
the
expression
of
the
purpose
and
power
of
the
one
working
in
and
through
you
it
is
the
one
life
manifesting
in
you
through
its
creative
will
and
not
only
is
this
all
the
creative
will
is
all
around
us
in
every
force
energy
and
principle
the
force
that
we
call
mental
power
is
the
principle
of
the
will
directed
by
our
individual
minds
in
this
statement
we
have
a
hint
of
the
great
mystery
of
mental
force
and
power
and
the
psychic
phenomena
it
also
gives
us
a
key
to
mental
healing
this
is
not
the
place
to
go
into
detail
regarding
these
phases
but
think
over
it
a
bit
this
will
power
of
the
universe
in
all
of
its
forms
and
phases
from
electricity
to
is
always
at
the
disposal
of
man
within
limits
and
subject
always
to
the
laws
of
the
creative
will
of
the
universe
those
who
acquire
an
understanding
of
the
laws
of
any
force
may
use
it
and
any
force
may
be
used
or
misused
and
the
nearer
in
understanding
and
consciousness
that
we
get
to
the
one
life
and
power
the
greater
will
be
our
possible
power
for
we
are
thus
getting
closer
and
closer
to
the
source
of
all
power
in
these
lessons
we
hope
to
be
able
to
tell
you
how
you
may
come
into
closer
touch
with
this
one
life
of
which
you
and
all
living
things
are
but
forms
shapes
and
channels
of
expression
under
the
operation
of
the
creative
will
we
trust
that
this
lesson
may
have
brought
to
your
minds
the
realization
of
the
oneness
of
all
the
fact
that
we
are
all
parts
of
the
one
encircling
unity
the
and
pulsations
of
which
are
to
be
felt
even
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
circle
of
life
in
man
in
monad
in
crystal
in
atom
try
to
feel
that
inner
essence
of
creative
will
that
is
within
yourselves
and
endeavor
to
realize
your
complete
inner
unity
in
it
with
all
other
forms
of
life
try
to
realize
as
some
recent
writer
has
expressed
it
that
all
the
living
world
is
but
mankind
in
the
making
and
that
we
are
but
part
of
the
all
and
also
remember
that
splendid
vistas
of
future
unfoldment
spread
themselves
out
before
the
gaze
of
the
awakened
soul
until
the
mind
fails
to
grasp
the
wondrous
sight
we
will
now
close
this
lesson
by
calling
your
attention
to
its
central
thought
there
is
but
one
power
in
the
universe
one
energy
one
force
and
that
power
energy
and
force
is
a
manifestation
of
the
one
life
there
can
be
no
other
power
for
there
is
none
other
than
the
one
from
whom
power
may
come
and
there
can
be
no
manifestation
of
power
that
is
not
the
power
of
the
one
for
no
other
power
can
be
in
existence
the
power
of
the
one
is
visible
in
its
manifestations
to
us
in
the
natural
laws
and
forces
of
nature
which
we
call
the
creative
will
this
creative
will
is
the
inner
moving
power
urge
and
pressure
behind
all
forms
and
shapes
of
life
in
atom
and
molecule
in
monad
in
cell
in
plant
in
fish
in
animal
in
man
the
life
principle
or
creative
will
is
constantly
in
action
creating
preserving
and
carrying
on
life
in
its
functions
we
may
call
this
instinct
or
nature
but
it
is
the
creative
will
in
action
this
will
is
back
of
all
power
energy
or
force
be
it
physical
mechanical
or
mental
force
and
all
force
that
we
use
consciously
or
unconsciously
comes
from
the
one
great
source
of
power
if
we
could
but
see
clearly
we
would
know
that
back
of
us
is
the
power
of
the
universe
awaiting
our
intelligent
uses
under
the
control
of
the
will
of
the
all
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
for
we
are
manifestations
of
the
one
life
from
which
all
power
proceeds
and
the
real
self
is
above
the
effect
for
it
is
part
of
the
cause
but
over
and
above
under
and
behind
all
forms
of
being
matter
energy
force
and
power
is
the
absolute
ever
calm
ever
peaceful
ever
content
in
knowing
this
it
becomes
us
to
manifest
that
spirit
of
absolute
trust
faith
and
confidence
in
the
goodness
and
ultimate
justice
of
that
which
is
the
only
reality
there
is
peace
be
with
you
the
fourth
lesson
the
unity
of
life
in
our
first
lesson
of
this
series
we
spoke
of
the
one
reality
underlying
all
life
this
one
reality
was
stated
to
be
higher
than
mind
or
matter
the
nearest
term
that
can
be
applied
to
it
being
spirit
we
told
you
that
it
was
impossible
to
explain
just
what
spirit
is
for
we
have
nothing
else
with
which
to
compare
or
describe
it
and
it
can
be
expressed
only
in
its
own
terms
and
not
in
the
terms
applicable
to
its
emanations
or
manifestations
but
as
we
said
in
our
first
lesson
we
may
think
of
spirit
as
meaning
the
essence
of
life
and
being
the
reality
underlying
universal
life
and
from
which
the
latter
emanates
in
the
second
lesson
we
stated
that
this
spirit
which
we
called
the
absolute
expressed
itself
in
the
universal
life
which
universal
life
manifested
itself
in
countless
forms
of
life
and
activity
in
the
same
lesson
we
showed
you
that
the
universe
is
alive
that
there
is
not
a
single
dead
thing
in
it
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
dead
object
in
the
universe
else
the
theory
and
truth
of
the
one
underlying
life
must
fall
and
be
rejected
in
that
lesson
we
also
showed
you
that
even
in
the
world
of
inorganic
things
there
was
ever
manifest
life
in
every
atom
and
particle
of
inorganic
matter
there
is
the
universal
life
energy
manifesting
itself
and
in
constant
activity
in
the
third
lesson
we
went
still
further
into
this
phase
of
the
general
subject
and
showed
you
that
the
creative
will
that
active
principle
of
the
universal
life
was
ever
at
work
building
up
new
forms
shapes
and
combinations
and
then
tearing
them
down
for
the
purpose
of
rebuilding
the
material
into
new
forms
shapes
and
combinations
the
creative
will
is
ever
at
work
in
its
threefold
function
of
creating
preserving
and
destroying
forms
the
change
however
being
merely
in
the
shape
and
form
or
combination
the
real
substance
remaining
unchanged
in
its
inner
aspect
notwithstanding
the
countless
apparent
changes
in
its
objective
forms
like
the
great
ocean
the
depths
of
which
remain
calm
and
undisturbed
and
the
real
nature
of
which
is
unchanged
in
spite
of
the
waves
and
billows
of
surface
manifestation
so
does
the
great
ocean
of
the
universal
life
remain
unchanged
and
unaltered
in
spite
of
the
constant
play
of
the
creative
will
upon
the
surface
in
the
same
lesson
we
gave
you
many
examples
of
the
will
in
action
of
its
wondrous
workings
in
the
various
forms
of
life
and
activity
all
of
which
went
to
show
you
that
the
one
power
was
at
work
everywhere
and
at
all
times
in
our
next
lesson
the
fifth
lesson
we
shall
endeavor
to
make
plain
to
you
the
highest
teachings
of
the
yogi
philosophy
regarding
the
one
reality
and
the
many
manifestations
the
one
and
the
many
how
the
one
apparently
becomes
many
that
great
question
and
problem
which
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
of
truth
in
that
lesson
we
shall
present
for
your
consideration
some
fundamental
and
startling
truths
but
before
we
reach
that
point
in
our
teachings
we
must
fasten
upon
your
mind
the
basic
truth
that
all
the
various
manifestations
of
life
that
we
see
on
all
hands
in
the
universe
are
but
forms
of
manifestation
of
one
universal
life
which
is
itself
an
emanation
of
the
absolute
speaking
generally
we
would
say
to
you
that
the
emanation
of
the
absolute
is
in
the
form
of
a
grand
manifestation
of
one
universal
life
in
which
the
various
apparent
separate
forms
of
life
are
but
centers
of
energy
or
consciousness
the
separation
being
more
apparent
than
real
there
being
a
bond
of
unity
and
connection
underlying
all
the
apparently
separated
forms
unless
the
student
gets
this
idea
firmly
fixed
in
his
mind
and
consciousness
he
will
find
it
difficult
to
grasp
the
higher
truths
of
the
yogi
philosophy
that
all
life
is
one
at
the
last
that
all
forms
of
manifestation
of
life
are
in
harmonious
unity
underlying
is
one
of
the
great
basic
truths
of
the
yogi
teaching
and
all
the
students
of
that
philosophy
must
make
this
basic
truth
their
own
before
they
may
progress
further
this
grasping
of
the
truth
is
more
than
a
mere
matter
of
intellectual
conception
for
the
intellect
reports
that
all
forms
of
life
are
separate
and
distinct
from
each
other
and
that
there
can
be
no
unity
amidst
such
diversity
but
from
the
higher
parts
of
the
mind
comes
the
message
of
an
underlying
unity
in
spite
of
all
apparent
diversity
and
if
one
will
meditate
upon
this
idea
he
will
soon
begin
to
realize
the
truth
and
will
that
he
himself
is
but
a
center
of
consciousness
in
a
great
ocean
of
life
that
he
and
all
other
centers
are
connected
by
countless
spiritual
and
mental
filaments
and
that
all
emerge
from
the
one
he
will
find
that
the
illusion
of
separateness
is
but
a
working
fiction
of
the
universe
as
one
writer
has
so
aptly
described
it
and
that
all
is
one
at
the
last
and
underlying
all
is
one
some
of
our
students
may
feel
that
we
are
taking
too
long
a
path
to
lead
up
to
the
great
basic
truths
of
our
philosophy
but
we
who
have
traveled
the
path
and
know
its
rocky
places
and
its
sharp
turns
feel
justified
in
insisting
that
the
student
be
led
to
the
truth
gradually
and
surely
instead
of
attempting
to
make
short
cuts
across
dangerous
ravines
and
canyons
we
must
insist
upon
presenting
our
teachings
in
our
own
way
for
this
way
has
been
tested
and
found
good
we
know
that
every
student
will
come
to
realize
that
our
plan
is
a
wise
one
and
that
he
will
thank
us
for
giving
him
this
gradual
and
easy
approach
to
the
wondrous
and
awful
truth
which
is
before
us
by
this
gradual
process
the
mind
becomes
accustomed
to
the
line
of
thought
and
the
underlying
principles
and
also
gradually
discards
wornout
mental
sheaths
which
have
served
their
purposes
and
which
must
be
discarded
because
they
begin
to
weigh
heavily
upon
the
mind
as
it
reaches
the
higher
altitudes
of
the
path
of
attainment
therefore
we
must
ask
you
to
consider
with
us
in
this
lesson
some
further
teachings
regarding
the
unity
of
life
all
the
schools
of
the
higher
oriental
thought
as
well
as
many
of
the
great
philosophical
minds
of
the
western
world
have
agreed
upon
the
conception
of
the
unity
of
life
the
oneness
of
all
life
the
western
thinkers
and
many
of
the
eastern
philosophers
arrived
at
this
conclusion
by
means
of
their
intellectual
powers
greatly
heightened
and
stimulated
by
concentration
and
meditation
which
latter
process
liberated
the
faculties
of
the
spiritual
mind
so
that
it
passed
down
knowledge
to
the
intellect
which
then
seized
upon
the
higher
knowledge
which
it
found
within
itself
and
amplified
and
theorized
upon
the
same
but
among
the
eastern
masters
there
are
other
sources
of
information
open
and
from
these
sources
come
the
same
report
the
oneness
and
unity
of
universal
life
these
higher
sources
of
information
to
which
we
have
alluded
consist
of
the
knowledge
coming
from
those
beings
who
have
passed
on
to
higher
planes
of
life
than
ours
and
whose
awakened
spiritual
faculties
and
senses
enable
them
to
see
things
quite
plainly
which
are
quite
dark
to
us
and
from
these
sources
also
comes
the
message
of
the
oneness
of
life
of
the
existence
of
a
wonderful
universal
life
including
all
forms
of
life
as
we
know
it
and
many
forms
and
phases
unknown
to
us
many
centers
in
the
great
ocean
of
life
no
matter
how
high
the
source
of
inquiry
the
answer
is
the
same
all
life
is
one
and
this
one
life
includes
beings
as
much
higher
than
ourselves
as
we
are
higher
than
the
creatures
in
the
slime
of
the
included
in
it
are
beings
who
would
seem
as
archangels
or
gods
to
us
and
they
inform
that
beyond
them
are
still
higher
and
more
radiant
creatures
and
so
on
to
infinity
of
infinities
and
yet
all
are
but
centers
of
being
in
the
one
life
all
but
a
part
of
the
great
universal
life
which
itself
is
but
an
emanation
of
the
absolute
the
mind
of
man
shrinks
back
appalled
from
the
contemplation
of
such
wonders
and
yet
there
are
men
who
dare
to
attempt
to
speak
authoritatively
of
the
attributes
and
qualities
of
god
as
if
he
the
absolute
were
but
a
magnified
man
verily
indeed
fools
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
as
the
poet
hath
said
those
who
will
read
our
next
lesson
and
thus
gain
an
idea
of
the
sublime
conception
of
the
absolute
held
by
the
yogi
teachers
may
shudder
at
the
presumption
of
those
mortals
who
dare
to
think
of
the
absolute
as
possessing
attributes
and
qualities
like
unto
the
meanest
of
things
in
this
his
emanated
universe
but
even
these
spiritual
infants
are
doing
well
that
is
they
are
beginning
to
and
when
man
begins
to
and
he
begins
to
progress
it
is
not
the
fact
of
these
people
immature
ideas
that
has
caused
these
remarks
on
our
part
but
rather
their
tendency
to
set
up
their
puny
conceptions
as
the
absolute
truth
and
then
insisting
upon
forcing
these
views
upon
the
outer
world
of
men
whom
they
consider
poor
ignorant
heathen
permit
each
man
to
think
according
to
his
light
and
help
him
by
offering
to
share
with
him
the
best
that
you
possess
but
do
not
attempt
to
force
upon
him
your
own
views
as
absolute
truth
to
be
swallowed
by
him
under
threat
of
damnation
or
eternal
punishment
who
are
you
that
dares
to
speak
of
punishment
and
damnation
when
the
smell
of
the
smoke
of
the
hell
of
materialism
is
still
upon
your
robes
when
you
realize
just
what
spiritual
infants
you
still
are
the
best
of
you
you
will
blush
at
these
things
hold
fast
to
the
best
that
you
know
be
generous
to
others
who
seem
to
wish
to
share
your
knowledge
but
give
without
blame
or
feeling
of
superiority
for
those
whom
you
teach
today
may
be
your
teachers
tomorrow
there
are
many
surprises
of
this
kind
along
the
path
be
brave
and
confident
but
when
you
begin
to
feel
puffed
up
by
your
acquirement
of
some
new
bit
of
knowledge
let
your
prayer
prayer
for
we
too
are
infants
be
lord
be
merciful
unto
me
a
fool
the
above
words
are
for
us
the
students
of
the
yogi
philosophy
the
teachers
of
the
same
for
human
nature
is
the
same
in
spite
of
names
and
we
must
avoid
the
vanity
of
vanities
spiritual
pride
and
arrogance
that
fault
which
has
sent
many
a
soul
tumbling
headlong
from
a
high
position
on
the
path
and
compelled
it
to
again
begin
the
journey
chastened
and
bruised
the
fall
of
lucifer
has
many
correspondences
upon
the
occult
plane
and
is
indeed
in
itself
an
allegorical
illustration
of
just
this
law
remember
always
that
you
are
but
a
centre
in
the
ocean
of
life
and
that
all
others
are
centres
in
the
same
ocean
and
that
underlying
both
and
all
of
you
is
the
same
calm
bed
of
life
and
knowledge
the
property
of
all
the
highest
and
the
lowest
are
part
of
the
same
one
life
each
of
you
has
the
same
life
blood
flowing
through
your
veins
you
are
connected
with
every
other
form
of
life
high
or
low
with
invisible
bonds
and
none
is
separate
from
another
we
are
speaking
of
course
to
the
personalities
of
the
various
students
who
are
reading
these
words
the
real
self
of
each
is
above
the
need
of
such
advice
and
caution
and
those
who
are
able
to
reach
the
real
self
in
consciousness
have
no
need
for
these
words
for
they
have
outlived
this
stage
of
error
to
many
the
consciousness
of
the
one
life
the
universal
life
in
which
all
are
centres
of
consciousness
and
being
has
come
gradually
as
a
final
step
of
a
long
series
of
thought
and
reasoning
aided
by
flashes
of
truth
from
the
higher
regions
of
the
mind
to
others
it
has
come
as
a
great
illumination
or
flash
of
truth
in
which
all
things
are
seen
in
their
proper
relations
and
positions
to
each
other
and
all
as
phases
of
being
in
the
one
the
term
cosmic
consciousness
which
has
been
used
in
the
previous
series
of
these
lessons
and
by
other
writers
means
this
sudden
flash
of
knowing
in
which
all
the
illusionary
dividing
lines
between
persons
and
things
are
broken
down
and
the
universal
life
is
seen
to
be
actually
existent
as
one
life
to
those
who
have
reached
this
consciousness
by
either
route
just
mentioned
or
by
other
routes
there
is
no
sense
of
loss
of
individuality
or
power
or
strength
on
the
contrary
there
is
always
a
new
sense
of
increased
power
and
strength
and
knowing
instead
of
losing
individuality
there
is
a
sense
of
having
found
it
one
feels
that
he
has
the
whole
universe
at
his
back
or
within
him
rather
than
that
he
has
lost
his
identity
in
the
great
ocean
of
life
while
we
are
speaking
of
this
phase
of
the
subject
we
should
like
to
ask
you
if
you
have
ever
investigated
and
inquired
into
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
individuality
have
you
ever
looked
up
its
origin
and
real
meaning
as
given
by
the
standard
authorities
we
are
sure
that
many
of
you
have
no
real
idea
of
the
actual
meaning
of
the
term
as
strange
as
this
statement
may
appear
to
you
at
first
glance
stop
now
and
define
the
word
to
yourself
as
you
have
been
accustomed
to
think
of
it
people
of
a
hundred
will
tell
you
that
it
means
something
like
a
strong
personality
let
us
see
about
this
webster
defines
the
word
individual
as
follows
not
divided
or
not
to
be
divided
existing
as
one
distinct
being
or
object
single
one
the
same
authority
informs
us
that
the
word
arises
from
the
latin
word
meaning
indivisible
not
divisible
does
not
this
help
you
to
gain
a
clearer
idea
of
the
individuality
that
knows
itself
to
be
a
centre
of
consciousness
in
the
one
life
rather
than
a
separate
puny
insignificant
thing
apart
from
all
other
centres
or
forms
of
life
or
the
source
of
life
we
think
it
will
help
to
clear
your
mind
of
some
of
the
fog
that
has
not
as
yet
lifted
itself
and
while
we
are
on
the
subject
of
definitions
let
us
take
a
little
look
at
the
word
personality
that
is
generally
believed
to
be
a
synonym
of
individuality
and
is
often
so
used
webster
tells
us
that
the
word
person
originated
from
the
latin
word
meaning
a
mask
used
by
actors
which
word
in
turn
arose
from
two
other
words
meaning
through
and
meaning
to
sound
the
two
combined
words
meaning
to
sound
through
the
same
authority
informs
us
that
the
archaic
meaning
of
the
word
was
a
character
or
part
as
in
a
play
an
assumed
character
if
you
will
think
of
personality
as
a
mask
used
by
an
actor
or
as
a
part
in
a
play
or
as
something
used
to
sound
through
or
to
speak
through
by
the
real
individual
behind
the
mask
of
personality
then
perhaps
you
will
see
a
little
further
into
the
mystery
of
personality
and
individuality
oh
dear
students
be
not
deceived
by
the
mask
of
personality
which
you
may
happen
to
be
wearing
at
this
moment
or
by
the
masks
which
are
worn
by
those
around
you
realize
that
back
of
your
mask
is
the
great
individual
the
indivisible
the
universal
life
in
which
you
are
a
centre
of
consciousness
and
activity
this
does
not
wipe
out
your
identity
instead
it
gives
you
a
greater
and
grander
identity
instead
of
your
sinking
into
a
nirvana
of
extinction
of
consciousness
your
consciousness
so
enlarges
as
you
unfold
that
you
will
in
the
end
feel
your
identity
to
be
the
identity
of
the
universe
instead
of
your
gaining
nothingness
you
gain
allness
all
spiritual
growth
and
unfoldment
gives
you
a
constantly
increasing
sense
of
relationship
with
and
agreement
with
the
all
you
grow
into
allness
as
you
unfold
be
not
deceived
by
this
chatter
about
nothingness
and
loss
of
individuality
in
the
oriental
thought
although
some
of
the
presentations
of
its
teachings
may
so
seem
to
mean
at
first
reading
remember
always
that
personality
is
the
mask
and
individuality
the
real
one
you
have
often
heard
persons
claiming
to
be
acquainted
with
the
teachings
of
theosophy
and
other
expositions
of
the
oriental
wisdom
religion
including
our
own
presentation
asserting
that
the
oriental
mind
was
ever
bent
upon
attaining
a
final
stage
of
nothingness
or
extinction
in
nirvana
in
addition
to
what
we
have
said
and
to
what
we
shall
say
on
this
subject
let
us
quote
from
the
inspired
writer
of
the
a
standard
theosophical
work
when
she
says
in
that
work
on
page
vol
i
is
this
annihilation
as
some
think
to
see
in
nirvana
annihilation
amounts
to
saying
of
a
man
plunged
in
a
sound
dreamless
sleep
one
that
leaves
no
impression
on
the
physical
memory
and
brain
because
the
sleeper
higher
self
is
in
its
original
state
of
absolute
consciousness
during
these
hours
that
he
too
is
annihilated
the
latter
simile
answers
only
to
one
side
of
the
question
the
most
material
since
reabsorption
is
by
no
means
such
a
dreamless
sleep
but
on
the
contrary
absolute
existence
an
unconditional
unity
or
a
state
to
describe
which
human
language
is
absolutely
and
hopelessly
inadequate
nor
is
the
individuality
nor
even
the
essence
of
the
personality
if
any
be
left
behind
lost
because
as
wm
lloyd
says
in
connection
with
the
above
quotation
this
seems
conclusive
proof
that
theosophy
does
not
regard
nirvana
as
annihilation
but
as
an
infinite
enlargement
of
consciousness
and
we
would
add
that
this
is
true
not
only
as
regards
the
nirvana
of
the
theosophist
but
also
of
the
consciousness
of
the
unity
of
life
the
universal
life
this
too
is
not
annihilation
of
individual
consciousness
but
an
infinite
enlargement
of
consciousness
as
this
western
writer
lloyd
has
so
well
expressed
it
the
very
consciousness
of
life
that
every
man
feels
within
him
comes
not
from
something
belonging
exclusively
to
himself
as
a
separate
or
personal
thing
on
the
contrary
it
belongs
to
his
individuality
not
to
his
personality
and
is
a
phase
of
his
consciousness
or
awareness
of
his
relation
to
the
one
universal
life
which
underlies
his
existence
and
in
which
he
is
a
center
of
consciousness
do
you
grasp
this
idea
if
not
meditate
and
concentrate
upon
it
for
it
is
important
you
must
learn
to
the
life
within
you
and
to
know
that
it
is
the
life
of
the
great
ocean
of
universal
life
upon
the
bosom
of
which
you
are
borne
as
a
centre
of
consciousness
and
energy
in
this
thought
there
is
power
strength
calm
peace
and
wisdom
acquire
it
if
you
are
wise
it
is
indeed
a
gift
from
the
gods
in
this
lesson
we
are
not
attempting
to
build
up
your
idea
of
the
unity
of
life
by
a
series
of
arguments
taken
from
a
world
of
phenomena
in
which
separateness
and
is
apparent
no
such
arguments
would
suffice
for
it
would
be
like
trying
to
prove
the
existence
and
laws
of
color
to
a
man
born
blind
by
arguments
taken
from
his
world
of
darkness
on
the
contrary
we
are
appealing
to
that
region
of
the
mind
in
which
is
stored
the
capacity
for
intuitively
apprehending
truth
we
are
endeavoring
to
speak
in
tones
which
will
awaken
a
similar
vibration
in
that
part
of
your
mentality
and
if
these
vibrations
be
started
into
being
then
will
you
be
able
to
and
the
truth
and
then
will
your
intellect
eagerly
seize
upon
the
new
idea
that
it
finds
within
itself
and
will
proceed
to
apply
the
same
to
the
various
problems
that
have
been
bothering
you
in
the
past
this
consciousness
of
unity
must
come
from
the
higher
regions
of
the
mind
for
the
intellect
alone
knows
it
not
it
is
out
of
its
field
just
as
one
may
not
know
that
the
earth
is
round
by
means
of
his
senses
which
report
quite
the
contrary
but
may
and
does
know
this
truth
by
abstract
reasoning
and
higher
intellectual
effort
so
may
one
know
the
truth
that
all
life
is
indeed
one
at
the
last
and
underlying
by
the
higher
faculties
of
the
mind
although
his
senses
and
ordinary
intellectual
processes
fail
to
so
inform
him
the
senses
can
not
inform
man
that
the
earth
is
round
they
can
not
see
it
as
a
whole
but
only
in
while
the
higher
reasoning
faculties
are
able
to
visualize
the
earth
as
a
whole
and
know
it
must
be
round
and
the
intellect
in
its
ordinary
field
can
see
only
separateness
and
can
not
report
oneness
but
the
higher
mind
sees
life
as
a
whole
and
knows
it
to
be
one
and
it
is
the
higher
mind
that
we
are
trying
to
bring
into
the
field
of
consciousness
in
the
appeal
to
you
in
this
lesson
we
trust
that
we
may
be
successful
in
fact
we
that
we
shall
be
so
in
many
cases
for
we
know
that
the
field
is
ready
for
the
sowing
of
the
seed
and
that
the
call
has
been
heard
and
the
message
passed
on
to
us
to
answer
the
call
else
these
words
would
not
have
been
written
the
consciousness
of
the
unity
of
life
is
something
that
must
be
experienced
before
the
truth
may
be
realized
it
is
not
necessary
for
one
to
wait
until
he
acquire
full
cosmic
consciousness
before
he
may
realize
at
least
partially
the
oneness
of
all
life
for
he
may
unfold
gradually
into
the
cosmic
knowing
experiencing
at
each
stage
a
fuller
conception
of
the
underlying
unity
of
life
in
which
he
is
a
centre
of
consciousness
and
manifestation
but
there
must
be
at
least
a
partial
unfoldment
before
one
is
able
to
the
sense
of
unity
to
those
who
have
not
unfolded
sufficiently
to
gain
at
least
a
glimmering
of
the
truth
everything
appears
separate
from
every
other
thing
and
there
is
no
unity
of
all
it
is
as
if
every
leaf
on
a
mighty
tree
were
to
consider
itself
a
being
separate
and
distinct
from
everything
else
in
the
world
failing
to
perceive
its
connection
with
the
branch
or
limb
and
tree
and
its
unity
in
being
with
every
other
leaf
on
the
tree
after
a
bit
the
unfolding
consciousness
of
the
leaf
enables
it
to
perceive
the
stem
that
connects
it
with
the
twig
then
it
begins
to
realize
certain
relationships
and
feels
its
vital
connection
with
the
twig
and
the
few
other
leaves
attached
to
the
same
twig
later
on
it
unfolds
sufficiently
to
perceive
that
certain
other
twigs
are
connected
with
the
same
branch
and
it
learns
to
feel
its
relationship
with
all
twigs
and
leaves
springing
from
that
branch
then
again
a
little
later
on
it
begins
to
realize
that
other
branches
spring
from
the
same
limb
as
its
branch
and
the
sense
of
relationship
and
dawning
unity
begins
to
widen
still
further
and
so
it
goes
on
until
at
last
the
tiny
leaflet
realizes
that
the
life
of
the
tree
is
the
life
of
all
of
its
parts
limbs
branches
twigs
leaves
blossoms
fruit
seed
and
that
it
itself
is
but
a
centre
of
expression
in
the
one
life
of
the
tree
does
the
leaf
feel
less
important
and
real
from
this
discovery
we
should
say
assuredly
not
for
it
must
feel
that
behind
its
tiny
form
and
limited
strength
is
the
strength
and
vitality
of
the
entire
organism
of
the
tree
it
must
know
that
the
tree
is
ever
at
work
extracting
nourishment
from
the
earth
air
and
water
and
transmitting
that
nourishment
to
its
every
part
including
our
little
friend
the
leaflet
it
knows
that
the
sap
will
rise
in
the
spring
to
renew
the
manifestations
of
life
and
it
knows
that
although
its
leafy
form
may
wither
and
die
still
the
essence
of
its
life
its
real
life
does
not
die
but
remains
ever
active
and
strong
awaiting
its
chance
for
future
expression
and
of
course
this
figure
of
the
leaf
and
the
tree
fails
us
if
we
attempt
to
carry
it
very
far
but
it
will
give
us
at
least
a
partial
idea
of
the
relationship
between
the
life
of
the
person
and
the
one
life
some
of
the
oriental
teachers
have
illustrated
this
idea
to
their
students
by
various
familiar
examples
and
figures
of
speech
some
bid
the
student
hold
up
his
hand
and
then
point
out
to
him
that
each
finger
is
apparently
separate
and
distinct
if
one
does
not
look
down
to
where
it
joins
the
hand
each
finger
if
it
had
consciousness
might
well
argue
that
it
was
a
separate
individual
having
no
relationship
with
any
other
finger
it
might
prove
this
to
its
own
satisfaction
and
to
that
of
its
listeners
by
showing
that
it
could
move
itself
without
stirring
the
other
fingers
and
so
long
as
its
consciousness
was
confined
to
its
upper
two
joints
it
would
remain
under
the
illusion
of
separateness
but
when
its
consciousness
at
last
permeated
the
depths
of
its
being
it
would
find
that
it
emerged
from
the
same
hand
from
which
also
sprung
the
other
fingers
and
that
its
real
life
and
power
was
vested
in
the
hand
rather
than
in
itself
and
that
although
apparently
separate
and
independent
it
was
really
but
a
part
of
the
hand
and
when
its
consciousness
through
the
consciousness
of
the
hand
broadened
and
widened
it
would
perceive
its
relationship
with
and
interdependence
with
the
whole
body
and
would
also
recognize
the
power
of
the
brain
and
its
mighty
will
another
favorite
illustration
of
the
eastern
teachers
is
the
stream
of
water
flowing
over
a
rocky
bed
they
point
to
the
stream
before
it
comes
to
a
rocky
place
and
show
the
student
that
it
is
one
then
they
will
move
a
little
way
down
the
stream
and
show
him
how
the
rocks
and
stones
divide
the
stream
into
countless
little
streams
each
of
which
might
imagine
itself
a
separate
and
distinct
stream
until
later
on
it
again
joins
the
main
united
stream
and
finds
that
it
was
but
a
form
of
expression
of
the
one
another
illustration
that
is
frequently
used
by
the
teachers
is
that
which
bids
the
student
consider
himself
as
a
minute
cell
or
as
the
hindus
call
it
in
a
body
it
may
be
a
cell
in
the
blood
performing
the
office
of
a
carrier
or
messenger
or
it
may
be
a
working
cell
in
one
of
the
organs
of
the
body
or
it
may
be
a
thinking
cell
in
the
brain
at
any
rate
the
cell
manifests
capacity
for
thought
action
and
memory
and
a
number
of
secondary
attributes
quite
wonderful
in
the
way
see
chapter
xviii
each
cell
might
well
consider
itself
as
a
separate
individual
in
a
certain
sense
it
it
has
a
certain
degree
of
something
akin
to
consciousness
enabling
it
to
perform
its
work
correctly
and
properly
and
is
called
upon
at
times
to
manifest
something
like
judgment
it
may
well
be
excused
for
thinking
of
itself
as
a
person
having
a
separate
life
the
analogy
between
its
illusions
and
that
of
the
man
when
seen
by
a
master
is
very
close
but
we
know
that
the
life
of
the
cell
is
merely
a
centre
of
expression
of
the
life
of
the
body
that
its
consciousness
is
merely
a
part
of
the
consciousness
of
the
mind
animating
the
body
the
cell
will
die
and
apparently
perish
but
the
of
it
will
remain
in
the
life
of
the
person
whose
body
it
occupied
and
nothing
really
dies
or
perishes
would
the
cell
feel
any
less
real
if
it
knew
that
behind
its
personality
as
a
cell
there
was
the
individuality
of
the
man
that
its
real
self
was
the
man
not
the
cell
of
course
even
this
figure
of
speech
can
be
carried
only
so
far
and
then
must
stop
for
the
personality
of
the
man
when
it
is
dissolved
leaves
behind
it
an
essence
which
is
called
character
which
becomes
the
property
of
the
ego
and
which
accompanies
it
into
after
life
according
to
the
law
of
karma
of
which
we
shall
speak
in
future
lessons
but
back
even
of
these
attributes
of
personality
is
the
ego
which
exists
in
spite
of
personality
and
lives
on
and
on
throughout
many
personalities
and
yet
learning
the
lessons
of
each
until
at
last
it
rises
above
personality
and
enters
into
higher
sphere
of
knowing
and
being
still
another
favorite
illustration
of
the
hindu
teachers
is
that
of
the
sun
beating
down
upon
the
ocean
and
causing
a
portion
of
the
water
to
rise
in
the
form
of
vapor
this
vapor
forms
clouds
which
spread
all
over
the
earth
and
which
eventually
condense
in
the
form
of
rain
drops
dew
etc
this
rain
and
dew
form
streams
rivers
and
sooner
or
later
every
drop
finds
its
way
back
to
mother
ocean
which
is
its
real
self
separate
though
the
dewdrop
be
yet
it
is
a
part
of
the
ocean
no
matter
how
far
distant
it
may
be
and
the
attraction
of
the
ocean
will
surely
and
without
fail
draw
it
back
to
its
bosom
and
the
dewdrop
if
it
could
know
the
truth
would
be
so
much
happier
and
stronger
and
braver
if
it
could
know
that
it
was
superior
to
accident
time
and
space
and
that
it
could
not
escape
its
own
good
and
that
nothing
could
prevent
its
final
triumph
and
victory
when
at
last
the
dewdrop
glides
into
the
shining
sea
how
cheerfully
it
could
have
met
its
many
changes
of
form
and
the
incidents
of
its
journey
if
it
could
have
gotten
rid
of
the
illusion
of
separateness
and
knew
that
instead
of
being
a
tiny
insignificant
dewdrop
it
was
a
part
of
the
mighty
ocean
in
fact
that
its
real
self
was
that
ocean
itself
and
that
the
ocean
was
continually
drawing
it
toward
it
and
that
the
many
changes
up
and
down
were
in
response
to
that
mighty
power
of
attraction
which
was
slowly
but
irresistibly
drawing
it
back
home
to
rest
peace
and
power
as
valuable
as
are
all
these
illustrations
examples
and
figures
of
speech
still
all
must
of
necessity
fall
short
of
the
truth
in
the
case
of
the
soul
of
man
that
wondrous
something
which
has
been
built
up
by
the
absolute
after
aeons
and
aeons
of
time
and
which
is
destined
to
play
an
important
part
in
the
great
cosmic
drama
which
it
has
pleased
the
absolute
to
think
into
existence
drawing
its
life
from
the
universal
life
it
has
the
roots
of
its
being
still
further
back
in
the
absolute
itself
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
lesson
great
and
wonderful
is
it
all
and
our
minds
are
but
illy
fitted
to
receive
the
truth
and
must
be
gradually
accustomed
to
the
glare
of
the
sun
but
it
will
come
to
all
none
can
escape
his
glorious
destiny
the
oriental
writings
are
full
of
allusions
to
the
underlying
oneness
in
fact
the
entire
oriental
philosophies
rest
upon
it
you
may
find
it
everywhere
if
you
will
but
look
for
it
the
experience
of
cosmic
consciousness
which
is
naught
but
a
sudden
or
gradual
awareness
of
the
underlying
unity
of
life
is
evidenced
everywhere
in
the
that
wonderful
series
of
teachings
in
the
hindu
classics
every
writer
in
the
collection
gives
his
evidence
regarding
this
awareness
of
unity
and
oneness
and
the
experiences
and
mental
characteristics
arising
from
the
same
the
following
quotations
will
give
an
idea
of
the
prevalence
of
this
thought
he
that
beholds
all
beings
in
the
self
and
the
self
in
all
things
he
never
turns
away
from
it
when
to
a
man
who
understands
the
self
has
become
all
things
what
sorrow
what
trouble
can
there
be
to
him
who
once
beheld
that

the
mystics

added
their
testimony

knowledge
has
three
degrees
opinion
science
and
illumination
the
last
is
absolute
knowledge
founded
upon
the
identity
of
the
knowing
mind
with
the

object
and
eckhardt
the
german
mystic
has
told
his
pupils
that
god
is
the
soul
of
all
things
he
is
the
light
that
shines
in
us
when
the
veil
is
rent
and
tennyson
in
his
wonderful
verse
describing
the
temporary
lifting
of
the
veil
for
him
has
described
a
phase
of
cosmic
consciousness
in
the
following
words
for
knowledge
is
the
swallow
on
the
lake
that
sees
and
stirs
the
there
but
never
yet
hath
dippt
into
the
abysm
the
abysm
of
all
abysms
beneath
within
the
blue
of
sky
and
sea
the
green
of
earth
and
in
the
of
a
grain
which
cleft
and
cleft
again
for
evermore
and
ever
vanishing
never
vanishes
and
more
my
son
for
more
than
once
when
i
sat
all
alone
revolving
in
myself
that
word
which
is
the
symbol
of
myself
the
mortal
symbol
of
the
self
was
loosed
and
past
into
the
nameless
as
a
cloud
melts
into
heaven
i
touched
my
limbs
the
limbs
were
strange
not
mine
and
yet
no
shadow
of
doubt
but
utter
clearness
and
through
loss
of
self
the
gain
of
such
large
life
as
matched
with
ours
were
sun
to
spark
unshadowable
in
words
themselves
but
shadows
of
a
and
not
only
among
the
mystics
and
poets
is
this
universal
truth
experienced
and
expressed
but
among
the
great
philosophers
of
all
ages
may
we
find
this
teaching
of
the
unity
of
life
originally
voiced
in
the
the
grecian
thinkers
have
expressed
the
thought
the
chinese
philosophers
have
added
their
testimony
the
modern
philosophers
spinoza
berkeley
kant
hegel
schopenhauer
hartman
ferrier
royce
although
differing
widely
in
their
theories
all
have
expressed
as
a
fundamental
truth
the
unity
of
life
a
one
life
underlying
the
basic
teachings
of
the
vedas
are
receiving
confirmation
at
the
hands
of
modern
science
which
while
calling
itself
rationalistic
and
inclining
to
a
materialistic
conception
of
the
universe
still
finds
itself
compelled
to
say
at
the
last
all
is
one
and
in
nearly
every
human
soul
there
is
a
secret
chamber
in
which
the
text
of
this
knowledge
lies
hidden
and
in
the
rare
moments
in
which
the
chamber
door
is
opened
in
response
to
poetry
music
art
deep
religious
feeling
or
those
unaccountable
waves
of
uplift
that
come
to
all
the
truth
is
recognized
for
the
moment
and
the
soul
feels
at
peace
and
is
content
in
the
feeling
that
it
is
at
harmony
with
the
all
the
sense
of
beauty
however
expressed
when
keenly
experienced
has
a
tendency
to
lift
us
out
of
our
consciousness
of
separateness
into
another
plane
of
mind
in
which
the
keynote
is
unity
the
higher
the
human
feeling
the
nearer
is
the
conscious
realization
of
the
underlying
unity
this
realization
of
the
unity
of
life
the
oneness
of
life
the
great
life
even
when
but
faintly
experienced
renders
life
quite
a
different
thing
to
the
person
he
feels
no
longer
that
he
is
a
mere
part
of
something
that
may
be
destroyed
or
that
he
is
a
tiny
personal
something
separate
from
and
opposed
to
all
the
rest
of
the
universe
but
that
he
is
instead
a
unit
of
expression
a
centre
of
consciousness
in
the
great
one
life
he
realizes
that
he
has
the
power
and
strength
and
life
and
wisdom
of
the
whole
back
of
him
upon
which
he
may
learn
to
draw
as
he
unfolds
he
realizes
that
he
is
at
home
and
that
he
can
not
be
thrust
out
for
there
is
no
outside
of
the
all
he
feels
within
himself
the
certainty
of
infinite
life
and
being
for
his
life
is
the
all
life
and
that
can
not
die
the
petty
cares
and
worries
and
griefs
and
pains
of
everyday
personal
life
are
seen
for
what
they
are
and
they
cease
to
threaten
and
dominate
him
as
of
old
he
sees
the
things
of
personality
as
merely
the
costume
and
trappings
of
the
part
in
the
play
of
life
that
he
is
acting
out
and
he
knows
that
when
he
discards
them
he
will
still
be
i
when
one
really
feels
the
consciousness
of
the
one
life
underlying
he
acquires
a
confident
trust
and
faith
and
a
new
sense
of
freedom
and
strength
comes
to
him
for
is
he
not
indeed
delivered
from
the
bondage
of
fear
that
has
haunted
him
in
his
world
of
separateness
he
feels
within
him
the
spiritual
pulse
of
the
universal
life
and
at
once
he
thrills
with
a
sense
of
power
and
being
he
becomes
reconciled
with
life
in
all
its
phases
for
he
knows
these
things
as
but
temporary
phases
in
the
working
out
of
some
great
universal
plan
instead
of
things
permanent
and
fixed
and
beyond
remedy
he
begins
to
feel
the
assurance
of
ultimate
justice
and
god
and
the
old
ideas
of
injustice
and
evil
begin
to
fade
from
him
he
who
enters
into
the
consciousness
of
the
universal
life
indeed
enters
into
a
present
realization
of
the
life
everlasting
all
fear
of
being
lost
or
eternally
damned
fades
away
and
one
instinctively
realizes
that
he
is
saved
because
he
is
of
the
one
life
and
can
not
be
lost
all
the
fear
of
being
lost
arises
from
the
sense
of
illusion
of
separateness
or
apartness
from
the
one
life
once
the
consciousness
of
unity
is
gained
fear
drops
from
the
soul
like
a
wornout
garment
when
the
idea
and
consciousness
of
the
unity
takes
possession
of
one
he
feels
a
new
sense
of
cheerfulness
and
optimism
entirely
different
from
any
other
feeling
that
he
has
ever
experienced
he
loses
that
distrust
and
hardness
which
seems
to
cling
to
so
many
in
this
age
who
have
arrived
at
the
intellectual
stage
of
development
and
have
been
unable
to
progress
further
a
new
sense
of
peace
and
harmony
comes
to
one
and
illuminates
his
entire
character
and
life
the
bitterness
engendered
by
the
illusion
of
separateness
is
neutralized
by
the
sweetness
of
the
sense
of
unity
when
one
enters
into
this
consciousness
he
finds
that
he
has
the
key
to
many
a
riddle
of
life
that
has
heretofore
perplexed
him
many
dark
corners
are
illuminated
many
hard
sayings
are
made
clear
paradoxes
become
understandable
truths
and
the
pairs
of
opposites
that
dwell
in
all
advanced
intellectual
conceptions
seem
to
bend
around
their
ends
and
form
themselves
into
a
circle
to
the
one
who
understands
the
unity
all
nature
seems
akin
and
friendly
there
is
no
sense
of
antagonism
or
opposition
everything
is
seen
to
fit
into
its
place
and
work
out
its
appointed
task
in
the
universal
plan
all
nature
is
seen
to
be
friendly
when
properly
understood
and
man
regains
that
sense
of
harmonious
environment
and
that
he
lost
when
he
entered
the
stage
of
the
lower
animal
and
the
children
feel
this
unity
in
their
poor
imperfect
way
but
man
lost
this
paradise
when
he
discovered
good
and
evil
but
paradise
lost
becomes
paradise
regained
when
man
enters
into
this
new
stage
of
consciousness
but
unlike
the
animal
or
child
which
instinctively
feels
the
unity
the
awakened
soul
of
man
possesses
the
unity
consciousness
coupled
with
intelligent
comprehension
and
unfolding
spiritual
power
he
has
found
that
which
he
lost
together
with
the
accumulated
interest
of
the
ages
this
new
kingdom
of
consciousness
is
before
the
race
all
must
enter
into
it
in
time
all
will
enter
into
it
many
are
entering
into
it
now
by
gradual
stages
this
dawning
sense
of
unity
is
that
which
is
causing
the
spiritual
unrest
which
is
now
agitating
the
world
and
which
in
time
will
bring
the
race
to
a
realization
of
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
and
his
kinship
to
every
living
thing
we
are
entering
into
this
new
cycle
of
human
unfoldment
and
the
greatest
changes
are
before
the
race
ye
who
read
these
words
are
in
the
foremost
ranks
of
the
new
dispensation
else
you
would
not
be
interested
in
this
subject
you
are
the
leaven
which
is
designed
to
lighten
the
heavy
mass
of
the
play
well
your
parts
you
are
not
alone
mighty
forces
and
great
intelligences
are
behind
you
in
the
work
be
worthy
of
them
peace
be
with
you
carry
with
you
the
central
thought
of
this
lesson
central
thought
is
but
one
life
a
universal
life
in
the
world
this
one
life
is
an
emanation
from
the
absolute
it
infills
all
forms
shapes
and
manifestations
of
life
and
is
the
real
life
that
each
imagines
to
be
his
personal
property
there
is
but
one
and
you
are
centres
of
consciousness
and
expression
in
that
one
there
is
a
unity
and
harmony
which
becomes
apparent
to
those
who
enter
into
the
consciousness
of
the
one
life
there
is
peace
and
calm
in
the
thought
there
is
strength
and
power
in
the
knowledge
enter
ye
into
your
kingdom
of
power
possess
yourselves
of
your
birthright
of
knowledge
in
the
very
center
of
your
being
you
will
find
a
holy
of
holies
in
which
dwells
the
consciousness
of
the
one
life
underlying
enter
into
the
silence
of
the
shrine
the
fifth
lesson
the
one
and
the
many
as
we
have
stated
in
previous
lessons
all
philosophies
which
thinkers
have
considered
worthy
of
respect
find
their
final
expression
of
truth
in
the
fundamental
thought
that
there
is
but
underlying
all
the
manifold
manifestations
of
shape
and
form
it
is
true
that
the
philosophers
have
differed
widely
in
their
conception
of
that
one
but
nevertheless
they
have
all
agreed
upon
the
logical
necessity
of
the
fundamental
conception
that
there
is
at
least
but
one
reality
underlying
all
even
the
materialists
have
conceded
this
conclusion
and
they
speak
and
think
of
a
something
called
matter
as
the
one
holding
that
inherent
in
matter
is
the
potentiality
of
all
life
the
school
of
energists
holding
that
matter
in
itself
is
and
that
it
is
merely
a
mode
of
manifestation
of
a
something
called
energy
asserts
that
this
something
called
energy
is
one
fundamental
real
and
the
various
forms
of
western
religious
thought
which
hold
to
the
various
conceptions
of
a
personal
deity
also
hold
to
a
oneness
inasmuch
as
they
teach
that
in
the
beginning
there
was
god
only
and
that
all
the
universe
has
been
by
him
they
do
not
go
into
details
regarding
this
creation
and
unlike
the
oriental
teachers
they
fail
to
distinguish
between
the
conception
of
the
of
shape
and
on
the
one
hand
and
the
of
the
substance
of
these
shapes
and
on
the
other
hand
but
even
accepting
the
premises
of
these
people
who
hold
to
the
personal
deity
conception
it
will
be
seen
that
the
reason
requires
the
acceptance
of
one
or
two
ideas
that
the
deity
created
the
substance
of
these
shapes
and
forms
from
or
else
that
he
created
them
out
of
own
out
of
himself
in
fact
let
us
consider
briefly
these
two
conceptions
in
the
first
conception
creation
from
nothing
we
are
brought
face
to
face
with
an
impregnable
obstacle
inasmuch
as
the
human
reason
positively
refuses
to
think
of
anything
coming
from
nothing
while
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
finite
human
mind
can
not
undertake
to
limit
the
powers
of
the
infinite
or
to
insist
that
the
possibilities
of
the
divine
power
must
be
measured
and
limited
by
the
finite
power
of
man
still
it
must
hearken
to
the
report
of
its
own
highest
faculties
and
say
i
can
not
think
it
or
else
blindly
accept
the
teachings
of
other
finite
minds
which
are
equally
unable
to
think
it
and
which
have
no
superior
sources
of
information
the
infinite
power
has
endowed
us
with
reasoning
faculties
and
evidently
expects
us
to
use
them
to
their
full
capacity
else
the
gift
were
a
mockery
and
in
the
absence
of
information
from
higher
sources
than
the
reason
we
must
use
the
reason
in
thinking
of
this
matter
or
else
refuse
to
think
of
it
at
all
in
view
of
the
above
thought
let
us
then
consider
the
report
of
the
reason
regarding
this
matter
and
then
after
having
done
so
let
us
apply
the
test
of
this
report
of
the
reason
to
the
highest
teaching
of
the
yogi
philosophy
and
see
how
the
latter
stands
the
test
and
after
having
done
this
we
will
apply
the
test
of
the
higher
consciousness
to
the
same
teachings
remember
this
always
that
while
there
is
knowledge
that
transcends
reason
that
is
knowledge
that
comes
from
the
higher
regions
of
the
mind
still
even
such
information
of
the
spiritual
mind
not
run
contrary
to
although
it
goes
beyond
it
there
is
harmony
between
the
spiritual
mind
and
the
highest
reason
returning
to
the
consideration
of
the
matter
of
creation
of
substance
from
nothing
we
again
assert
that
reason
is
unable
to
think
of
the
creation
of
something
from
it
finds
the
statement
unthinkable
and
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
thought
it
is
true
that
the
reason
is
compelled
to
accept
as
a
final
truth
many
things
that
it
can
not
by
reason
of
its
finitude
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
there
is
no
logical
necessity
for
the
reason
to
accept
any
such
conception
as
this
there
is
no
warrant
in
the
reason
for
any
such
theory
idea
or
conclusion
let
us
stop
here
for
a
moment
and
examine
into
this
difference
it
may
help
us
to
think
clearer
hereafter
we
find
it
impossible
to
the
fact
of
the
infinite
being
having
always
existed
and
being
without
cause
we
find
it
impossible
to
conceive
of
the
nature
of
an
eternal
causeless
and
infinite
being
to
conceive
the
such
a
being
remember
but
while
this
is
so
still
our
reason
by
its
own
laws
compels
us
to
think
that
there
such
a
being
so
long
as
we
think
at
all
for
if
we
think
at
all
we
think
of
there
being
a
fundamental
reality
and
we
think
of
that
reality
as
being
without
cause
because
there
can
be
no
cause
for
the
first
cause
and
we
think
of
that
reality
as
being
eternal
because
it
could
not
have
sprung
into
being
from
nothing
and
therefore
must
have
always
been
and
we
think
of
that
reality
as
infinite
because
there
is
nothing
outside
of
itself
to
limit
it
think
over
this
statement
for
a
moment
until
you
grasp
it
fully
but
there
is
no
such
necessity
or
compulsion
in
the
case
of
the
question
of
creation
from
nothingness
on
the
contrary
the
necessity
and
compulsion
is
all
the
other
way
not
only
is
the
reason
unable
to
creation
from
nothing
not
only
does
all
its
laws
forbid
it
to
hold
such
a
conception
but
more
than
this
it
finds
within
itself
a
conception
and
potent
which
contradicts
this
idea
it
finds
within
itself
the
strong
certainty
that
really
is
has
always
and
that
all
transient
and
finite
shapes
forms
and
manifestations
proceed
from
that
which
is
real
infinite
causeless
and
infinite
and
moreover
be
composed
of
the
substance
of
that
for
there
is
nothing
else
real
from
which
they
could
have
been
composed
and
their
composition
from
nothing
is
unthinkable
for
nothing
is
nothing
and
always
will
be
nothing
nothing
is
merely
a
name
of
denial
of
existence
an
absolute
denial
of
substantiality
of
any
degree
kind
or
form
an
absolute
denial
of
reality
and
from
such
could
come
only
nothing
from
nothing
nothing
comes
therefore
finding
within
itself
the
positive
report
that
all
and
anything
there
is
must
be
composed
of
the
substance
of
the
reality
the
reason
is
compelled
to
think
that
the
universe
is
composed
of
the
substance
of
the
one
reality
whether
we
call
that
one
reality
by
the
name
of
the
absolute
or
whether
we
call
it
god
must
believe
that
from
this
all
things
in
the
universe
have
flown
out
or
been
emanated
rather
than
created
begotten
rather
than
made
this
does
not
mean
the
pantheistic
idea
that
the
universe
god
but
rather
that
god
while
existing
separate
and
apart
from
his
universe
in
his
essence
and
being
is
nevertheless
his
universe
and
his
universe
him
and
this
no
matter
what
conception
of
god
or
deity
is
had
or
whether
one
thinks
of
the
absolute
as
principle
the
truth
is
the
same
truth
no
matter
by
what
names
it
is
called
or
by
what
misconception
it
is
surrounded
the
truth
is
that
is
in
all
and
all
is
in
such
is
the
report
of
the
highest
reason
of
man
such
is
the
report
of
the
illumined
such
is
the
highest
teachings
that
have
come
down
to
the
race
from
the
great
souls
that
have
trodden
the
path
of
attainment
and
now
let
us
submit
the
yogi
philosophy
to
these
conceptions
and
reports
of
the
reason
and
let
us
discover
just
what
more
the
yogi
philosophy
has
to
say
concerning
the
the
substance
of
the
divine
which
infills
all
life
and
how
it
solves
the
riddle
of
the
sphinx
concerning
the
one
in
all
and
all
in
one
we
hope
to
show
you
that
the
riddle
is
capable
of
solution
and
that
the
old
yogi
teachers
have
long
ago
grasped
that
for
which
the
human
mind
has
ever
sought
this
phase
of
the
teachings
is
the
highest
and
it
is
usually
hinted
at
rather
than
expressed
in
the
writings
on
the
subject
owing
to
danger
of
confusion
and
misconception
but
in
these
lessons
we
shall
speak
the
truth
plainly
and
without
fear
for
such
is
the
message
which
has
been
given
us
to
deliver
to
our
students
and
we
will
perform
the
right
action
leaving
the
result
or
fruits
of
the
action
where
it
belongs
according
to
the
higher
teachings
found
in
the
and
in
the
higher
teachings
of
the
yogi
philosophy
the
fundamental
truth
embedded
in
the
of
the
east
the
higher
yogi
teachings
is
the
impregnable
doctrine
of
the
one
self
in
the
many
selves
the
many
selves
in
the
one
self
this
fundamental
truth
underlies
all
the
oriental
philosophies
which
are
esoteric
in
their
nature
notwithstanding
the
crude
and
often
repulsive
conceptions
and
practices
of
the
masses
of
the
people
who
represent
the
exoteric
or
popular
phase
of
the
teachings
and
these
two
phases
are
to
be
found
in
regions
still
there
is
always
this
inner
doctrine
of
the
one
self
to
be
found
to
those
who
look
for
it
not
only
is
this
true
among
the
hindus
but
even
among
the
mahommedans
of
all
countries
there
is
an
inner
circle
of
mystics
known
as
the
holding
to
this
truth
and
the
inner
teachings
of
the
philosophies
of
all
ages
and
races
have
held
likewise
and
the
highest
thought
of
the
philosophers
of
the
western
races
has
found
refuge
in
this
idea
of
the
or
universal
self
but
it
is
only
among
the
yogis
that
we
find
an
attempt
made
to
explain
the
real
nature
of
the
manifestation
of
the
one
in
many
the
holding
of
the
many
forms
in
the
one
self
before
proceeding
to
the
consideration
of
the
one
becomes
as
many
as
expounded
by
the
higher
yogi
teachings
it
becomes
necessary
to
speak
of
a
matter
upon
which
there
has
been
much
confusion
and
misunderstanding
not
only
on
the
part
of
the
students
of
various
oriental
philosophies
but
also
upon
the
part
of
some
of
the
teachers
themselves
we
allude
to
the
connection
between
the
one
the
absolute
in
its
essence
and
that
which
has
been
called
the
one
life
the
universal
life
etc
many
writers
have
spoken
of
the
universal
life
and
the
one
as
being
identical
but
such
is
a
grievous
error
finding
no
warrant
in
the
highest
yogi
teachings
it
is
true
that
all
living
forms
dwell
in
and
are
infilled
with
the
universal
life
that
all
life
is
one
we
have
taught
this
truth
and
it
is
indeed
truth
without
qualification
but
there
is
still
a
higher
truth
the
highest
truth
in
fact
and
that
is
that
even
this
universal
life
is
not
the
one
but
instead
is
in
itself
a
manifestation
of
and
emanation
from
the
one
there
is
a
great
difference
here
that
you
perceive
and
understand
it
before
proceeding
further
the
one
the
absolute
according
to
the
highest
teachings
is
pure
spirit
and
not
life
mind
or
being
as
we
understand
them
in
our
finite
and
mortal
expressions
but
still
all
life
mind
and
being
as
we
understand
them
spring
from
flow
from
and
emanate
from
the
one
and
more
than
this
may
be
spoken
of
as
of
the
life
mind
and
being
of
the
one
if
we
may
be
permitted
to
apply
the
names
of
finite
manifestations
to
the
infinite
reality
so
the
highest
teaching
is
that
the
universal
life
infilling
all
living
things
is
not
in
itself
the
being
and
life
of
the
one
but
is
rather
a
great
fundamental
emanation
of
the
one
the
manner
and
nature
of
which
will
be
spoken
of
as
we
proceed
remember
this
please
leading
up
to
the
supreme
idea
of
the
one
in
all
all
in
one
let
us
examine
into
the
report
of
the
reason
upon
the
the
substance
the
divine
substance
from
which
all
living
forms
are
shaped
and
from
which
all
that
we
know
as
finite
mind
is
likewise
composed
can
these
imperfect
and
finite
forms
be
composed
of
a
divine
and
perfect
substance
this
is
the
question
that
must
occur
to
the
minds
of
those
who
are
capable
of
deep
thought
on
the
subject
and
it
is
a
question
that
must
be
answered
and
it
can
be
answered
and
answered
in
the
higher
yogi
philosophy
let
us
examine
the
reports
of
the
reason
a
little
further
then
shall
we
be
ready
for
the
teachings
of
what
can
the
substance
of
the
infinite
be
composed
can
it
be
matter
yes
if
you
are
satisfied
with
the
reasoning
of
the
materialists
and
can
not
see
further
into
the
truth
these
teach
that
matter
is
god
and
that
god
is
matter
but
if
you
be
among
those
who
reject
the
materialistic
teachings
you
will
not
be
satisfied
with
this
answer
even
if
you
incline
toward
a
infinite
still
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
results
of
modern
scientific
investigation
and
know
that
science
has
seen
matter
resolve
itself
into
something
like
electric
energy
you
will
know
that
the
truth
must
lie
behind
and
beyond
matter
then
is
it
pure
energy
you
may
ask
pure
energy
what
that
can
you
think
of
energy
apart
from
material
manifestation
have
you
ever
known
of
such
a
thing
do
you
not
know
that
even
the
electron
theory
which
is
attracting
the
attention
of
advanced
modern
science
and
which
holds
that
all
things
are
composed
of
minute
particles
of
electric
energy
called
electrons
from
which
the
atoms
are
built
do
you
not
know
that
even
this
theory
recognizes
the
necessity
of
a
something
like
matter
only
infinitely
finer
which
they
call
the
ether
to
enfold
the
electric
energy
as
a
unit
to
give
it
a
as
it
were
and
can
you
escape
from
the
fact
that
the
most
advanced
scientific
minds
find
confronting
them
fact
that
in
all
energy
and
governing
its
actions
there
manifested
something
like
and
does
not
all
this
teach
thinkers
that
just
as
energy
creates
from
itself
that
which
is
called
matter
and
then
uses
it
as
a
vehicle
of
expression
and
action
so
does
this
something
like
mind
create
from
itself
that
which
we
call
energy
and
proceeds
to
use
it
with
its
accompanying
phase
of
matter
for
its
expression
does
not
all
advanced
research
show
us
that
in
all
matter
and
energy
there
are
evidences
of
the
operation
of
this
something
like
mind
and
if
this
be
so
are
we
not
justified
as
regarding
matter
and
energy
as
mere
effects
and
to
look
to
this
something
like
mind
as
the
more
fundamental
substance
we
think
so
and
science
is
beginning
to
think
so
too
and
soon
will
science
be
regarding
with
the
most
profound
respect
the
metaphysical
axiom
that
all
is
mind
you
will
see
by
reference
to
our
course
in
yogi
philosophy
the
general
yogi
teachings
regarding
the
emanation
of
the
one
known
respectively
as
mind
energy
and
matter
you
will
see
that
the
yogis
teach
that
mind
energy
and
matter
comprise
a
threefold
emanation
of
the
absolute
you
will
also
see
that
it
is
taught
that
mind
was
the
the
universal
mind
and
that
the
universal
energy
was
the
proceeding
from
mind
and
that
the
universal
matter
was
the
third
emanation
proceeding
from
energy
in
the
same
book
you
will
find
that
the
teaching
is
that
above
matter
energy
and
mind
is
the
essence
of
the
absolute
which
is
called
spirit
the
nature
of
which
is
to
the
mind
of
man
the
highest
conception
of
which
is
the
highest
manifestation
of
itself
mind
but
as
we
can
not
comprehend
spirit
otherwise
we
are
justified
in
thinking
of
it
as
something
like
infinite
mind
something
as
much
higher
than
finite
mind
as
that
is
higher
than
mere
energy
now
then
we
have
seen
the
folly
of
thinking
of
the
divine
substance
as
matter
or
energy
and
we
have
come
to
know
it
as
spirit
something
like
mind
only
infinitely
higher
but
which
still
may
be
thought
of
in
terms
of
infinite
mind
for
we
can
have
no
higher
terms
in
our
thinking
operations
so
we
may
then
assume
that
this
divine
nature
or
substance
is
spirit
which
we
will
think
of
as
infinite
mind
for
want
of
a
better
form
of
conception
we
have
seen
the
folly
of
thinking
of
the
divine
essential
substance
as
the
body
of
god
we
have
likewise
seen
the
folly
of
thinking
of
it
as
the
vital
energy
of
god
and
we
have
found
that
we
could
not
escape
thinking
of
it
as
the
spirit
or
infinite
mind
of
god
beyond
this
we
can
not
think
intelligently
but
do
you
not
see
that
all
this
exercise
of
the
reason
has
brought
us
to
the
point
where
we
must
think
that
this
divine
substance
which
the
uses
in
the
manifestation
of
universal
life
the
universe
and
all
the
forms
and
shapes
and
manifestations
of
life
and
things
in
the
universe
this
divine
substance
which
must
be
all
things
and
all
things
must
rest
even
as
the
bubble
rests
on
the
ocean
that
this
can
be
nothing
less
than
spirit
and
that
this
spirit
can
be
thought
of
only
as
infinite
mind
and
if
this
be
so
then
indeed
must
be
mind
and
mind
be
meaning
of
course
the
infinite
mind
not
the
finite
manifestation
that
we
mind
then
if
this
reasoning
has
been
correct
then
must
we
think
that
all
life
all
the
universe
everything
except
the
absolute
itself
be
held
in
the
infinite
mind
of
the
and
so
by
the
exercise
of
our
reason
by
listening
to
and
examining
its
reports
we
have
been
brought
face
to
face
eye
to
eye
heart
to
heart
with
the
teaching
of
the
illumined
ones
which
has
come
down
to
us
as
the
highest
teaching
of
the
yogi
philosophy
for
this
indeed
is
the
highest
conception
of
truth
in
the
yogi
teachings
this
that
all
manifestations
and
emanations
of
the
absolute
are
mental
creations
of
the
absolute
held
in
the
infinite
mind
the
infinite
spirit
in
them
and
they
in
the
infinite
spirit
that
the
only
real
thing
about
man
is
the
spirit
involved
in
the
the
rest
is
mere
personality
which
changes
and
ceases
to
be
the
spirit
in
the
soul
of
man
is
the
soul
of
the
soul
which
is
never
born
never
changeth
never
dieth
this
is
the
real
self
of
in
which
indeed
he
is
one
with
the
father
this
is
the
point
where
the
reasoning
mind
of
man
has
come
to
a
sense
of
agreement
with
the
highest
yogi
teachings
let
us
now
pass
on
to
the
teachings
themselves
let
us
listen
to
the
message
of
truth
in
this
consideration
of
the
highest
yogi
philosophy
and
its
teaching
we
would
again
say
to
our
students
that
which
we
said
to
them
in
the
advanced
course
that
we
do
not
attempt
to
teach
the
why
of
the
manifestation
of
the
absolute
but
rest
content
with
delivering
the
message
of
the
yogi
sages
which
deals
with
the
how
as
we
stated
in
the
lessons
referred
to
we
incline
to
that
school
of
the
higher
teachings
which
holds
that
the
why
of
the
infinite
manifestation
must
of
necessity
rest
with
the
infinite
alone
and
that
the
finite
mind
can
not
hope
to
answer
the
question
we
hold
that
in
all
the
universal
mind
or
in
any
of
its
mind
manifestations
there
is
to
be
found
no
answer
to
this
question
wrapped
in
the
essence
of
the
absolute
spirit
alone
is
this
final
answer
the
sages
and
masters
from
their
high
spiritual
points
of
observation
possess
many
truths
regarding
the
how
side
of
the
question
that
would
appear
almost
like
infinite
wisdom
itself
compared
with
our
puny
knowledge
but
even
these
great
souls
report
that
they
do
not
possess
the
answer
to
the
final
question
the
why
of
the
infinite
manifestation
and
so
we
may
be
excused
from
attempting
to
answer
it
and
without
shame
or
sense
of
shortcoming
do
we
still
say
to
this
question
we
do
not
know
in
order
that
the
final
question
may
be
fully
understood
let
us
consider
it
for
a
moment
we
find
the
question
arising
from
the
following
condition
the
human
reason
is
compelled
to
admit
that
there
is
an
infinite
eternal
causeless
reality
underlying
all
forms
of
manifestation
in
the
phenomenal
world
it
is
likewise
compelled
to
admit
that
this
reality
must
comprise
all
that
really
is
and
that
there
can
be
nothing
real
outside
of
itself
arising
from
this
is
the
truth
that
all
forms
of
phenomenal
manifestation
must
emanate
the
one
reality
for
there
is
nothing
else
real
from
which
they
could
emanate
and
the
that
these
forms
of
manifestation
must
also
be
the
being
of
the
one
reality
for
there
is
nowhere
outside
of
the
all
wherein
they
might
find
a
place
so
this
one
reality
is
seen
to
be
that
from
which
all
things
flow
and
that
in
which
all
things
live
and
move
and
have
their
being
therefore
all
things
and
are
the
one
reality
we
shall
consider
just
how
later
on
but
the
question
which
confronts
us
and
which
has
been
called
the
final
question
and
that
which
we
pronounce
unanswerable
is
this
why
has
the
infinite
manifested
and
emanated
finite
forms
of
being
you
will
see
the
nature
of
the
question
when
you
stop
to
consider
the
infinite
can
not
have
desire
for
that
is
a
finite
quality
it
can
not
lack
anything
for
that
would
take
away
from
its
infinity
and
even
if
it
did
lack
anything
from
whence
could
it
expect
to
acquire
it
for
there
is
nothing
outside
of
itself
if
it
lacks
anything
it
must
continue
to
always
lack
it
for
there
is
no
outside
source
from
which
it
could
obtain
anything
which
it
does
not
already
possess
and
desire
would
be
of
course
a
for
something
which
it
lacked
so
it
could
not
desire
unless
it
lacked
and
it
would
know
that
desire
would
be
hopeless
even
if
indeed
it
did
lack
so
you
see
that
if
we
regard
the
infinite
reality
as
perfect
we
must
drop
all
ideas
of
it
desiring
or
lacking
and
of
it
growing
or
improving
or
of
it
obtaining
more
power
or
knowledge
these
ideas
are
ridiculous
for
an
absolute
infinite
reality
must
possess
else
it
is
not
absolute
and
infinite
and
if
it
does
not
possess
these
attributes
of
being
then
it
can
never
hope
to
acquire
them
for
there
is
nowhere
from
whence
they
could
be
acquired
there
is
no
source
outside
of
the
a
finite
thing
may
lack
and
desire
and
improve
and
develop
for
there
is
the
universal
source
from
which
it
may
draw
but
the
infinite
has
no
universal
source
for
it
is
its
own
source
do
you
see
the
nature
of
the
final
question
if
not
we
will
again
state
it
it
is
this
why
should
the
infinite
reality
which
possesses
all
that
may
be
possessed
and
which
in
itself
is
the
only
source
of
things
why
should
it
desire
to
manifest
a
universe
from
and
within
itself
a
little
consideration
will
show
you
that
there
is
no
intelligent
answer
to
the
why
either
in
your
own
minds
or
in
the
writings
and
teachings
of
the
greatest
minds
the
matter
is
important
to
those
who
are
confronted
every
day
with
some
of
the
many
attempts
to
answer
this
final
question
it
is
well
that
our
students
inform
them
regarding
the
futility
of
such
questioning
and
with
this
end
in
view
we
shall
herein
give
a
few
of
the
wise
guesses
at
the
answer
and
our
reasons
for
considering
them
inadequate
we
ask
the
student
to
consider
carefully
these
remarks
for
by
so
doing
he
will
post
himself
and
will
be
saved
much
tedious
and
perplexing
wandering
along
the
dangerous
places
in
the
swamp
of
metaphysics
following
the
of
finite
mind
masquerading
as
the
infinite
wisdom
beware
of
the
false
lights
they
lead
to
the
quagmire
and
quicksands
of
thought
let
us
now
consider
some
of
these
guesses
at
the
answer
to
the
final
question
some
thinkers
have
held
that
the
absolute
was
bound
by
a
divine
necessity
to
manifest
itself
as
many
the
answer
to
this
is
that
the
absolute
could
not
be
by
anything
inner
or
outer
else
it
would
not
be
absolute
and
infinite
but
would
be
relative
and
finite
another
set
of
thinkers
have
held
that
the
absolute
found
within
itself
a
desire
to
manifest
as
many
from
whence
could
come
such
an
desire
the
absolute
could
lack
nothing
and
there
would
be
nothing
for
it
to
desire
to
gain
other
than
that
which
it
already
possessed
one
does
not
desire
things
one
already
has
but
only
what
he
lacks
another
school
would
tell
us
that
the
infinite
wished
to
itself
in
the
phenomenal
world
why
such
a
phenomenal
world
could
only
be
reflection
of
its
power
witnessed
only
by
itself
and
could
contain
nothing
that
was
not
already
contained
in
the
all
to
what
end
would
such
a
wish
tend
what
would
be
accomplished
or
gained
the
infinite
all
could
not
become
anything
more
than
it
already
was
so
why
the
wish
for
expression
some
say
that
the
whole
phenomenal
world
is
but
or
illusion
and
does
not
exist
at
all
then
who
else
than
the
infinite
caused
the
illusion
and
why
the
necessity
this
answer
only
removes
the
question
back
one
point
and
does
not
really
answer
it
some
would
say
that
the
universe
is
the
dream
of
the
infinite
can
we
conceive
the
infinite
being
as
exercising
the
finite
faculty
of
dreaming
is
not
this
childish
others
would
have
us
believe
that
the
absolute
is
indulging
in
a
game
or
play
when
he
makes
universes
and
those
inhabiting
them
can
anyone
really
believe
this
of
the
absolute
playing
like
a
child
with
men
and
women
worlds
and
suns
as
its
blocks
and
why
should
the
infinite
play
does
it
need
amusement
and
fun
like
a
child
poor
man
with
his
attempts
to
read
the
riddle
of
the
infinite
we
know
of
teachers
who
gravely
instruct
their
pupils
in
the
idea
that
the
absolute
and
infinite
one
manifests
universes
and
universal
life
and
all
that
flows
from
them
because
it
wishes
to
gain
experience
through
objective
existence
this
idea
in
many
forms
has
been
so
frequently
advanced
that
it
is
worth
while
to
consider
its
absurdity
in
the
first
place
what
experience
could
be
gained
by
the
absolute
and
infinite
one
what
could
it
expect
to
gain
and
learn
that
it
did
not
already
know
and
possess
one
can
gain
experience
only
from
others
and
outside
things
not
from
oneself
entirely
separated
from
the
outside
world
of
things
and
there
would
be
no
outside
for
the
infinite
these
people
would
have
us
believe
that
the
absolute
emanated
a
universe
from
itself
which
could
contain
nothing
except
that
which
was
obtained
from
itself
and
then
proceeded
to
gain
experience
from
it
having
no
outside
from
which
it
could
obtain
experiences
and
sentences
and
sensations
it
proceeded
to
make
from
itself
an
imitation
one
that
is
what
this
answer
amounts
to
can
you
accept
it
the
whole
trouble
in
all
of
these
answers
or
attempted
answers
is
that
the
answerer
first
conceives
of
the
being
as
a
man
and
then
proceeds
to
explain
what
this
big
man
would
do
this
is
but
an
exaggerated
form
of
anthropomorphism
the
conception
of
god
as
a
man
raised
to
great
proportions
it
is
but
an
extension
of
the
idea
which
gave
birth
to
the
savage
conceptions
of
deity
as
a
cruel
chief
or
mighty
warrior
with
human
passions
hates
and
revenge
love
passions
and
desires
arising
from
the
same
cause
and
akin
to
the
theories
advanced
above
are
similar
ones
which
hold
that
the
absolute
can
not
dwell
alone
but
must
forever
bring
forth
souls
from
itself
this
was
the
idea
of
the
greek
philosopher
others
have
thought
that
the
infinite
was
possessed
of
such
a
consuming
love
that
it
manifested
objects
upon
which
it
could
bestow
its
affections
others
have
thought
that
it
was
lonesome
and
desired
companionship
some
have
spoken
of
the
absolute
as
sacrificing
itself
in
becoming
many
instead
of
remaining
one
others
have
taught
that
the
infinite
somehow
has
become
entangled
in
its
manifestations
and
had
lost
the
knowledge
of
its
oneness
hence
their
teachings
of
i
am
god
others
holding
to
a
similar
idea
tell
us
that
the
infinite
is
deliberately
masquerading
as
the
many
in
order
to
fool
and
mystify
itself
a
show
of
itself
by
itself
and
for
itself
is
not
this
speculative
metaphysics
run
wild
can
one
in
calm
thought
so
regard
the
infinite
and
absolute
being
causeless
lacking
nothing
perfect
one
as
acting
and
performing
thus
and
from
these
motives
is
not
this
as
childish
as
the
childishness
of
the
savage
and
barbarians
in
their
conceptions
let
us
leave
this
phase
of
the
subject
the
higher
yogi
teachings
hold
to
no
such
ideas
or
theories
it
holds
that
the
answer
to
the
secret
is
vested
in
the
infinite
alone
and
that
finite
guesses
regarding
the
why
are
futile
and
pitiful
it
holds
that
while
one
should
use
the
reason
to
the
full
still
there
are
phases
of
being
that
can
be
considered
only
in
love
faith
and
confidence
in
that
from
which
all
things
flow
and
in
which
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
it
recognizes
that
the
things
of
the
spirit
are
known
by
the
mind
it
explores
the
regions
of
the
universal
mind
to
its
utmost
limits
fearlessly
but
it
pauses
before
the
closed
door
of
the
spirit
reverently
and
lovingly
but
remember
this
that
while
the
higher
yogi
teachings
contain
no
guess
or
speculative
theory
regarding
the
why
of
the
divine
manifestation
still
they
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
a
why
in
fact
they
expressly
hold
that
the
absolute
manifestation
of
the
many
is
in
pursuance
of
some
wondrous
divine
plan
and
that
the
unfoldment
of
the
plan
proceeds
along
and
orderly
lines
and
according
to
law
they
trust
in
the
wisdom
and
love
of
the
absolute
being
and
manifest
a
perfect
confidence
trust
and
peaceful
patience
in
the
ultimate
justice
and
final
victory
of
the
divine
plan
no
doubt
disturbs
this
idea
it
pays
no
attention
to
the
apparent
contradictions
in
the
finite
phenomenal
world
but
sees
that
all
things
are
proceeding
toward
some
goal
and
that
all
is
well
with
the
universe
but
they
do
not
think
for
a
moment
or
teach
in
the
slightest
degree
that
all
this
unfoldment
and
plan
of
the
universe
has
for
its
object
any
advantage
benefit
or
gain
to
the
absolute
such
a
thought
would
be
for
the
absolute
is
already
perfect
and
its
perfection
can
not
be
added
to
or
taken
away
from
but
they
do
positively
teach
that
there
is
a
great
beneficial
purpose
in
all
the
plan
accruing
in
the
end
to
the
developed
souls
that
have
evolved
through
the
workings
of
the
plan
these
souls
do
not
possess
the
qualities
of
the
infinite
they
are
finite
and
thus
are
capable
of
receiving
benefits
of
growing
developing
unfolding
attaining
and
therefore
the
yogis
teach
that
this
building
up
of
great
souls
seems
to
be
the
idea
of
the
infinite
so
far
as
may
be
gained
from
an
observation
of
the
workings
of
the
plan
the
absolute
can
not
great
souls
for
its
own
pleasure
and
therefore
their
must
be
for
their
own
advantage
happiness
and
benefit
the
yogis
teach
on
this
subject
that
there
can
be
only
one
real
perfect
being
perfect
without
experience
perfect
from
the
beginning
but
only
one
in
other
words
they
teach
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
absolute
perfection
outside
of
the
absolute
itself
and
that
not
even
the
absolute
being
can
create
another
absolute
being
for
in
that
case
there
would
be
no
absolute
being
at
all
but
only
relative
think
over
this
for
a
moment
and
you
will
see
its
truth
the
absolute
must
always
be
the
one
without
a
second
as
the
yogis
express
it
there
can
not
be
perfect
ones
and
so
all
finite
beings
being
finite
must
work
their
way
up
toward
the
plane
of
perfection
by
the
path
of
life
with
all
of
its
lessons
tasks
cares
pains
and
strivings
this
is
the
only
way
open
to
them
and
even
the
absolute
can
not
have
it
otherwise
and
still
be
the
absolute
there
is
a
fine
point
here
the
absolute
is
but
even
that
is
not
sufficient
to
enable
it
to
destroy
its
absolute
being
and
so
you
who
have
wondered
perhaps
you
may
now
understand
our
words
in
the
first
lesson
of
this
series
in
which
we
said
that
the
message
of
the
absolute
to
some
of
the
illumined
has
been
all
is
being
done
in
the
best
and
only
possible
way
i
am
doing
the
best
i
can
all
is
well
and
in
the
end
will
so
appear
and
as
we
also
said
in
that
first
lesson
the
absolute
instead
of
being
an
indifferent
and
unmoved
spectator
to
its
own
creation
is
a
striving
longing
active
suffering
rejoicing
feeling
spirit
partaking
of
the
feelings
of
its
manifestations
rather
than
callously
witnessing
them
it
lives
in
us
with
us
through
us
back
of
all
the
pain
in
the
world
may
be
found
a
great
feeling
and
suffering
love
and
in
this
thought
there
is
comfort
to
the
doubting
soul
peace
to
the
troubled
mind
in
the
sixth
lesson
we
shall
proceed
to
deliver
to
you
the
further
message
of
truth
concerning
how
the
one
absolute
manifests
its
mental
images
as
universe
universal
life
and
forms
and
shapes
and
individualities
and
personalities
we
had
hoped
to
include
the
whole
message
in
this
fifth
lesson
but
now
find
that
we
have
merely
laid
the
steps
by
which
the
student
may
reach
the
essential
truth
but
lest
the
student
may
be
left
in
an
uncertain
state
of
mind
awaiting
the
conclusion
of
the
consideration
of
the
subject
and
lest
he
may
think
that
we
intend
teaching
him
that
the
universe
and
all
in
it
including
himself
are
dreams
because
we
have
said
that
all
things
are
in
the
mind
of
the
absolute
lest
this
misunderstanding
may
arise
we
wish
to
add
a
few
parting
words
to
what
we
have
said
we
wish
to
impress
upon
the
mind
of
the
student
that
though
all
things
are
but
in
the
mind
of
the
absolute
being
and
that
while
it
is
true
that
the
entire
universe
of
universes
is
simply
a
held
in
the
mind
of
the
absolute
still
this
fact
does
not
mean
that
all
things
are
illusions
or
dreams
remember
this
now
and
forever
o
student
that
that
which
is
held
in
the
absolute
mind
as
a
is
and
is
all
there
is
outside
of
the
absolute
itself
when
the
absolute
forms
a
it
forms
it
out
of
its
own
mental
substance
when
the
absolute
holds
anything
in
its
mind
it
holds
it
in
itself
for
the
absolute
is
the
absolute
is
not
a
material
being
from
which
material
beings
are
created
it
is
a
spiritual
being
a
being
whose
substance
is
akin
to
that
which
we
call
mind
only
raised
to
infinity
and
absolute
perfection
and
power
and
this
is
the
only
way
it
can
create
by
creating
a
in
its
mental
or
spiritual
substance
the
faintest
thought
of
the
absolute
is
more
real
and
durable
than
anything
that
man
can
create
in
fact
man
can
create
nothing
for
all
the
hard
and
real
material
he
uses
in
his
creations
such
as
steel
diamonds
granite
are
but
some
of
the
minor
forms
thought
into
being
by
the
absolute
and
also
remember
this
that
the
absolute
can
not
think
of
anything
without
putting
itself
in
that
thing
as
its
essence
just
as
a
mental
images
are
not
only
his
mind
his
mind
is
in
them
why
you
doubting
and
timorous
ones
does
not
even
the
finite
thinking
of
man
manifest
itself
in
physical
and
material
changes
of
form
and
shape
does
not
a
man
every
thought
actually
create
physical
forms
and
shapes
in
his
and
physical
tissue
you
who
are
reading
these
words
yea
you
are
reading
these
words
are
creating
changes
of
form
and
shape
in
your
and
physical
organism
your
mind
is
constantly
at
work
also
in
building
up
your
physical
body
along
the
lines
of
the
instinctive
mind
see
previous
series
of
lessons
you
are
mentally
creating
in
a
miniature
universe
every
moment
of
your
life
and
yet
the
idea
of
the
absolute
creating
a
universe
by
pure
thought
in
its
own
mind
and
thereafter
causing
the
work
of
the
universe
to
proceed
according
to
law
by
simply
willing
it
so
causes
you
to
wonder
and
perhaps
to
doubt
o
ye
of
little
faith
you
would
deny
to
the
absolute
even
the
power
you
possess
yourself
you
plan
things
in
your
mind
every
day
and
then
proceed
to
cause
them
to
appear
in
material
manifestation
and
yet
you
doubt
the
ability
of
the
absolute
to
do
likewise
why
even
the
poets
or
writers
of
fiction
create
characters
in
their
minds
and
these
seem
so
real
that
even
you
imagine
them
to
be
actual
entities
and
you
weep
over
their
pains
and
smile
at
their
joys
and
yet
all
this
is
on
the
finite
plane
why
even
the
imaginations
of
your
petty
finite
undeveloped
minds
have
sufficient
power
to
make
your
physical
bodies
sick
or
well
or
even
to
cause
you
to
die
from
some
imagined
ailment
and
yet
you
doubt
the
power
of
the
absolute
to
think
things
into
being
you
tiny
students
in
the
great
kindergarten
of
life
you
must
learn
better
lessons
from
your
little
blocks
and
games
and
you
this
is
the
law
and
you
who
are
filled
with
the
sense
of
your
smallness
and
unreality
know
you
that
so
long
as
you
are
held
in
the
mind
of
god
then
so
long
are
you
remembered
by
him
and
so
long
as
you
are
remembered
by
him
no
real
harm
can
befall
you
and
your
reality
is
second
only
to
his
own
even
though
you
pass
out
of
your
mortal
frame
doth
he
remember
you
in
his
mind
and
keeping
you
there
he
holds
you
safe
and
unharmed
the
greatest
satisfaction
that
can
come
to
one
is
to
be
able
to
fully
realize
that
he
or
she
is
held
firmly
in
the
mind
of
the
infinite
being
to
such
comes
the
knowledge
that
in
that
life
there
can
be
no
death
peace
be
with
you
in
this
realization
may
you
make
it
your
own
the
sixth
lesson
within
the
mind
of
the
one
in
our
last
lesson
we
gave
you
the
inner
teachings
of
the
yogi
philosophy
relating
to
the
real
nature
of
the
universe
and
all
that
is
therein
contained
we
trust
that
you
have
pondered
well
and
carefully
the
statements
contained
in
that
lesson
for
in
them
is
to
be
found
the
essence
of
the
highest
yogi
teachings
while
we
have
endeavored
to
present
these
high
truths
to
you
in
the
simplest
possible
form
yet
unless
your
minds
have
been
trained
to
grasp
the
thought
you
may
have
trouble
in
fully
assimilating
the
essence
of
the
teachings
but
be
not
discouraged
for
your
mind
will
gradually
unfold
like
the
flower
and
the
sun
of
truth
will
reach
into
its
inmost
recesses
do
not
be
troubled
if
your
comprehension
seems
dull
or
your
progress
slow
for
all
things
will
come
to
you
in
time
you
can
not
escape
the
truth
nor
can
the
truth
escape
you
and
it
will
not
come
to
you
one
moment
sooner
than
you
are
ready
to
receive
it
nor
will
it
be
delayed
one
moment
in
its
coming
when
you
are
ready
for
it
such
is
the
law
and
none
can
escape
it
nor
alter
it
nor
modify
it
all
is
well
and
all
is
under
the
law
nothing
ever
happens
to
many
the
thought
that
the
universe
and
all
that
is
therein
contained
are
simply
thought
forms
in
the
infinite
mind
mental
creations
of
the
absolute
may
seem
startling
and
a
sense
of
unreality
may
pervade
one
this
is
inevitable
but
the
reaction
will
come
to
some
who
have
grasped
this
mighty
truth
there
has
come
a
feeling
that
all
is
nothing
which
idea
is
embodied
in
their
teachings
and
writings
but
this
is
merely
the
negative
phase
of
the
truth
there
is
a
positive
phase
which
comes
as
one
advances
the
negative
phase
shows
us
that
all
that
we
have
considered
as
real
and
permanent
the
foundations
of
the
universe
itself
is
but
a
mental
image
in
the
mind
of
the
absolute
and
therefore
lacks
the
fundamental
reality
that
we
had
previously
associated
with
it
and
realizing
this
we
are
at
first
apt
to
feel
that
indeed
all
is
nothing
and
to
fall
into
a
state
of
apathy
and
lack
of
desire
to
play
our
part
in
the
world
but
then
happily
the
reaction
sets
in
sooner
or
later
and
we
begin
to
see
the
positive
phase
of
the
truth
this
positive
phase
shows
us
that
while
all
the
forms
shapes
and
phenomena
of
the
universe
are
but
parts
of
a
great
still
the
all
must
be
reality
itself
else
there
would
not
be
even
the
appearance
of
a
universe
before
a
thing
can
be
a
mental
image
there
must
be
a
mind
to
hold
that
mental
image
and
a
being
to
possess
that
mind
and
the
very
essence
of
that
being
must
pervade
and
be
immanent
in
every
image
in
that
mind
just
as
are
really
in
your
mental
images
as
well
as
they
in
you
so
must
the
absolute
be
its
mental
images
or
creations
or
thought
forms
as
truly
as
they
are
in
the
mind
of
the
absolute
do
you
see
this
plainly
think
well
over
it
ponder
it
well
for
in
it
lies
the
truth
and
so
this
positive
phase
of
the
truth
is
far
from
depressing
it
is
the
most
stimulating
conception
one
can
hold
if
he
but
grasps
it
in
its
entirety
and
fulness
even
if
it
be
true
that
all
these
shapes
and
forms
and
appearances
and
phenomena
and
personalities
be
but
illusion
as
compared
to
the
inner
reality
what
of
it
are
you
not
then
assured
that
the
spirit
within
yourself
is
the
spirit
of
the
absolute
that
the
reality
within
you
is
the
reality
of
the
absolute
that
you
are
because
the
absolute
is
and
can
not
be
otherwise
does
not
the
peace
and
calm
and
security
and
bliss
that
comes
to
you
with
this
realization
far
more
than
counterbalance
the
petty
nothings
that
you
have
discarded
we
think
that
there
can
be
but
one
answer
to
this
when
you
have
fully
realized
the
truth
what
gives
you
the
greatest
satisfaction
and
content
in
life
let
us
see
well
there
is
the
satisfaction
of
immortality
the
human
mind
instinctively
craves
this
well
what
that
even
the
highest
finite
conceptions
of
future
life
have
given
you
can
compare
with
the
assurance
of
actual
being
in
and
of
the
absolute
what
are
your
petty
conceptions
of
heavens
paradises
divine
regions
of
the
blessed
and
the
other
ideas
of
the
various
religious
sects
when
compared
with
the
conceptions
of
your
infinite
and
eternal
existence
in
spirit
your
relation
with
the
one
that
conception
of
infinite
wisdom
being
and
bliss
when
you
grasp
this
truth
you
will
see
that
you
are
in
eternity
right
now
and
are
immortal
even
this
moment
as
you
have
always
been
now
what
we
have
said
above
is
not
intended
to
deny
the
or
planes
on
the
contrary
you
will
find
much
in
the
teachings
regarding
these
which
the
yogis
enter
into
with
much
detail
but
we
mean
that
back
of
all
the
heavens
and
celestial
planes
there
is
a
still
higher
state
of
being
being
the
absolute
being
even
the
heavens
and
and
regions
of
the
or
archangels
are
but
relative
states
there
is
a
state
higher
than
even
these
exalted
relative
states
and
that
is
the
state
of
the
conscious
unity
and
identity
with
the
one
when
one
enters
into
that
state
he
becomes
more
than
man
more
than
gods
he
is
then
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
and
now
before
proceeding
to
a
consideration
of
the
phenomenal
manifestation
of
the
absolute
the
evolving
of
the
universe
in
the
infinite
mind
we
will
again
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
underlies
all
the
universe
of
forms
shapes
and
appearances
and
that
is
as
we
stated
in
our
last
lesson
manifestations
and
emanations
of
the
absolute
are
mental
creations
of
the
absolute
held
in
the
infinite
mind
the
infinite
spirit
in
them
and
they
in
the
infinite
spirit
and
the
only
real
thing
about
man
is
the
spirit
involved
in
the
the
rest
is
mere
personality
which
changes
and
ceases
to
be
the
spirit
in
the
soul
of
man
is
the
soul
of
the
soul
which
is
never
born
never
changeth
never
dieth
this
is
the
real
self
of
man
in
which
indeed
he
is
one
with
the
and
now
let
us
consider
the
yogi
teachings
regarding
the
creation
of
the
universe
and
the
evolution
of
the
living
forms
thereon
we
shall
endeavor
to
give
you
the
story
as
plainly
as
may
be
holding
fast
to
the
main
thought
and
avoiding
the
of
details
so
far
as
is
possible
in
the
first
place
we
must
imagine
ourselves
back
to
the
beginning
of
a
day
of
brahm
the
first
dawn
of
that
day
which
is
breaking
from
the
darkness
of
a
night
of
brahm
before
we
proceed
further
we
must
tell
you
something
about
these
days
and
nights
of
brahm
of
which
you
have
seen
much
mention
in
the
oriental
writings
the
yogi
teachings
contain
much
regarding
the
days
and
nights
of
brahm
the
and
of
the
creative
principle
the
periods
of
and
the
periods
of
this
thought
runs
through
all
the
oriental
thought
although
in
different
forms
and
with
various
interpretations
the
thought
refers
to
the
occult
truth
that
there
is
in
cosmic
nature
alternate
periods
of
activity
and
inactivity
days
and
nights
and
wakefulness
and
sleep
this
fundamental
law
manifests
in
all
nature
from
universes
to
atoms
let
us
see
it
now
in
its
application
to
universes
at
this
point
we
would
call
the
attention
of
the
student
that
in
many
of
the
presentations
of
the
hindu
teachings
the
writers
speak
as
if
the
absolute
were
subject
to
this
law
of
rhythm
and
had
its
periods
of
rest
and
work
like
its
manifestations
this
is
incorrect
the
highest
teachings
do
not
so
hold
although
at
first
glance
it
would
so
appear
the
teaching
really
is
that
while
the
creative
principle
manifests
this
rhythm
still
even
this
principle
great
though
it
be
is
a
manifestation
of
the
absolute
and
not
the
absolute
itself
the
highest
hindu
teachings
are
firm
and
unmistakable
about
this
point
and
another
point
in
which
there
is
much
mistaken
teaching
in
the
periods
of
creative
inactivity
in
a
universe
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
there
is
no
activity
anywhere
on
the
contrary
there
is
never
a
cessation
of
activity
on
the
part
of
the
absolute
while
it
is
creative
night
in
one
universe
or
system
of
universes
there
is
intense
activity
of
in
others
when
we
say
the
universe
we
mean
the
universe
of
solar
systems
millions
of
such
systems
that
compose
the
particular
universe
of
which
we
have
any
knowledge
the
highest
teachings
tell
us
that
this
universe
is
but
one
of
a
system
of
universes
millions
in
number
and
that
this
system
is
but
one
in
a
higher
system
and
so
on
and
on
to
infinity
as
one
hindu
sage
hath
said
well
do
we
know
that
the
absolute
is
constantly
creating
universes
in
its
infinite
mind
and
constantly
destroying
them
and
though
millions
upon
millions
of
aeons
intervene
between
creation
and
destruction
yet
doth
it
seem
less
than
the
twinkle
of
an
eye
to
the
absolute
one
and
so
the
day
and
night
of
brahm
means
only
the
statement
of
the
alternating
periods
of
activity
and
inactivity
in
some
one
particular
universe
amidst
the
infinite
universality
you
will
find
a
mention
of
these
periods
of
activity
and
inactivity
in
the
the
great
hindu
epic
the
following
quotations
and
page
references
relate
to
the
edition
published
by
the
yogi
publication
society
which
was
compiled
and
adapted
by
the
writer
of
these
lessons
in
that
edition
of
the
on
page
you
will
find
these
words
attributed
to
the
absolute
one
in
human
incarnation
the
worlds
and
universes
yea
even
the
world
of
brahm
a
single
day
of
which
is
like
unto
a
thousand
four
billion
years
of
the
earth
and
his
night
as
much
these
worlds
must
come
and
go
the
days
of
brahm
are
succeeded
by
the
nights
of
brahm
in
these
brahmic
days
all
things
emerge
from
invisibility
and
become
visible
and
on
the
coming
of
the
brahmic
night
all
visible
things
again
melt
into
invisibility
the
universe
having
once
existed
melteth
away
and
lo
is
again
and
in
the
same
edition
on
page
we
find
these
words
attributed
to
the
same
speaker
at
the
end
of
a
a
day
of
brahm
a
period
of
creative
activity
i
withdraw
into
my
nature
all
things
and
beings
and
at
the
beginning
of
another
i
emanate
all
things
and
beings
and
my
creative
act
we
may
say
here
in
passing
that
modern
science
now
holds
to
the
theory
of
periods
of
rhythmic
change
of
rise
and
fall
of
evolution
and
dissolution
it
holds
that
beginning
at
some
time
in
the
past
aeons
of
time
there
was
the
beginning
of
an
upward
or
evolutionary
movement
which
is
now
under
way
and
that
according
to
the
law
of
nature
there
must
come
a
time
when
the
highest
point
will
be
reached
and
then
will
come
the
beginning
of
the
downward
path
which
in
time
must
come
to
an
end
being
succeeded
by
a
long
period
of
inactivity
which
will
then
be
followed
by
the
beginning
of
a
new
period
of
creative
activity
and
evolution
a
day
of
brahm
this
thought
of
this
law
of
rhythm
in
its
universal
form
has
been
entertained
by
the
thinkers
of
all
times
and
races
herbert
spencer
expressly
held
to
it
in
his
first
principles
expressing
it
in
many
ways
akin
to
this
evolution
must
come
to
a
close
in
complete
equilibrium
or
rest
and
again
it
is
not
inferable
from
the
general
progress
towards
equilibrium
that
a
state
of
universal
quiescence
or
death
will
be
reached
but
that
if
a
process
of
reasoning
ends
in
that
conclusion
a
further
process
of
reasoning
points
to
renewals
of
activity
and
life
and
again
rhythm
in
the
totality
of
changes
alternate
eras
of
evolution
and
dissolution
the
ancient
western
philosophers
also
indulged
in
this
idea
heraclitus
taught
that
the
universe
manifested
itself
in
cycles
and
the
stoics
taught
that
the
world
moves
in
an
endless
cycle
through
the
same
stages
the
followers
of
pythagoras
went
even
further
and
claimed
that
the
succeeding
worlds
resemble
each
other
down
to
the
minutest
detail
this
latter
idea
however
the
idea
of
the
eternal
recurrence
while
held
by
a
number
of
thinkers
is
not
held
by
the
yogi
teachers
who
teach
infinite
progression
an
evolution
of
evolution
as
it
were
the
yogi
teachings
in
this
last
mentioned
particular
are
resembled
more
by
the
line
of
lotze
thinking
as
expressed
in
this
sentence
from
his
the
series
of
cosmic
periods
each
link
of
which
is
bound
together
with
every
other
the
successive
order
of
these
sections
shall
compose
the
unity
of
an
melody
and
so
through
the
pages
of
heraclitus
the
stoics
the
pythagoreans
empedocles
virgil
down
to
the
present
time
in
nietzsche
and
his
followers
we
find
this
thought
of
universal
rhythm
that
fundamental
conception
of
the
ancient
yogi
philosophy
and
now
returning
to
the
main
path
of
our
thought
let
us
stand
here
at
the
beginning
of
the
dawn
of
a
day
of
brahm
it
is
verily
a
beginning
for
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
there
is
nothing
but
space
no
trace
of
matter
force
or
mind
as
we
know
these
terms
in
that
portion
of
infinite
space
that
is
of
course
in
that
portion
of
the
infinite
mind
of
the
absolute
one
for
even
space
is
a
conception
of
that
mind
there
is
nothing
this
is
the
darkest
moment
just
before
the
dawn
then
comes
the
breaking
of
the
dawn
of
the
brahmic
day
the
absolute
begins
the
creation
of
a
universe
and
how
does
it
create
there
can
be
no
creation
of
something
out
of
nothing
and
except
the
absolute
itself
there
is
but
nothing
therefore
the
absolute
must
create
the
universe
out
of
its
own
substance
if
we
can
use
the
word
substance
in
this
connection
substance
means
literally
that
which
stands
under
being
derived
from
the
two
latin
words
meaning
under
and
meaning
to
stand
the
english
word
understand
means
literally
to
stand
under
the
two
words
really
meaning
the
same
this
is
more
than
a
coincidence
so
the
absolute
must
create
the
universe
from
its
own
substance
we
have
seen
well
what
is
this
substance
of
the
absolute
is
it
matter
no
for
matter
we
know
to
be
in
itself
merely
a
manifestation
of
force
or
energy
then
is
it
force
or
energy
no
because
force
and
energy
in
itself
can
not
possess
mind
and
we
must
think
of
the
absolute
as
possessing
mind
for
it
manifests
mind
and
what
is
manifested
must
be
in
the
manifestor
or
manifesting
agent
then
this
substance
must
be
mind
well
yes
in
a
way
and
yet
not
mind
as
we
know
it
finite
and
imperfect
but
something
like
mind
only
infinite
in
degree
and
nature
something
sufficiently
greater
than
mind
as
we
know
it
to
admit
of
it
being
the
cause
of
mind
but
we
are
compelled
to
think
of
it
as
infinite
mind
for
our
finite
minds
can
hold
no
higher
conception
so
we
are
content
to
say
that
this
substance
from
which
the
absolute
must
create
the
universe
is
a
something
that
we
will
call
infinite
mind
fix
this
in
your
mind
please
as
the
first
step
in
our
conception
but
how
can
the
infinite
mind
be
used
to
create
finite
minds
shapes
forms
and
things
without
it
being
lessened
in
quantity
how
can
you
take
something
from
something
and
still
have
the
original
something
left
an
impossibility
and
we
can
not
think
of
the
absolute
as
dividing
itself
up
into
two
or
more
portions
for
if
such
were
the
case
there
would
be
two
or
more
absolutes
or
else
none
there
can
not
be
two
absolutes
for
if
the
absolute
were
to
divide
itself
so
there
would
be
no
absolute
but
only
two
relatives
two
finites
instead
of
one
infinite
do
you
see
the
absurdity
then
how
can
this
work
of
creation
be
accomplished
in
view
of
these
difficulties
which
are
apparent
even
to
our
finite
minds
you
may
thresh
this
question
over
and
over
again
in
your
minds
men
have
done
so
in
all
times
and
you
will
not
find
the
answer
except
in
the
fundamental
idea
of
the
yogi
teachings
and
this
fundamental
idea
is
that
the
creation
is
purely
a
mental
creation
and
the
universe
is
the
mental
image
or
in
the
mind
of
the
absolute
in
the
infinite
mind
itself
no
other
creation
is
possible
and
so
this
say
the
yogi
masters
this
is
the
secret
of
universal
creation
the
universe
is
and
the
infinite
mind
and
this
is
the
only
way
it
could
be
so
so
fix
in
your
mind
this
second
step
in
our
conception
but
then
you
ask
us
from
whence
comes
force
matter
and
finite
mind
well
asked
good
student
your
answer
shall
be
forthcoming
here
it
is
finite
mind
force
or
energy
and
matter
in
themselves
have
no
existence
they
are
merely
mental
images
or
in
the
infinite
mind
of
the
absolute
their
whole
existence
and
appearance
depends
upon
their
mental
conception
and
retention
in
the
infinite
mind
in
it
they
have
their
birth
rise
growth
decline
and
death
then
what
is
real
about
me
you
may
ask
surely
i
have
a
vivid
consciousness
of
reality
is
this
merely
an
illusion
or
shadow
no
not
so
that
sense
of
reality
which
you
possess
and
which
every
creature
or
thing
possesses
that
sense
of
i
am
is
the
perception
by
the
mental
image
of
the
reality
of
its
essence
and
that
essence
is
the
spirit
and
that
spirit
is
the
substance
of
the
absolute
embodied
in
its
conception
the
mental
image
it
is
the
perception
by
the
finite
of
its
infinite
essence
or
the
perception
by
the
relative
of
its
absolute
essence
or
the
perception
by
you
or
i
or
any
other
man
or
woman
of
the
real
self
which
underlies
all
the
sham
self
or
personality
it
is
the
reflection
of
the
sun
in
the
and
thousands
of
seemingly
thousands
of
suns
and
yet
but
one
and
yet
that
reflection
of
the
sun
in
the
dewdrop
is
more
than
a
reflection
for
it
is
the
substance
of
the
sun
itself
and
yet
the
sun
shines
on
high
one
and
undivided
yet
manifesting
in
millions
of
it
is
only
by
figures
of
speech
that
we
can
speak
of
the
unspeakable
reality
to
make
it
perhaps
plainer
to
some
of
you
let
us
remind
you
that
even
in
your
finite
mental
images
there
is
evident
many
forms
of
life
you
may
think
of
a
moving
army
of
thousands
of
men
and
yet
the
only
i
in
these
men
is
your
own
i
these
characters
in
your
mind
move
and
live
and
have
their
being
and
yet
there
is
nothing
in
them
except
you
the
characters
of
shakespeare
dickens
thackeray
balzac
and
the
rest
were
such
strong
mental
images
that
not
only
their
creators
were
carried
away
by
their
power
and
apparent
ability
but
even
you
who
read
of
them
many
years
after
perhaps
feel
the
apparent
reality
and
weep
or
smile
or
grow
angry
over
their
actions
and
yet
there
was
no
hamlet
outside
of
shakespeare
mind
no
micawber
outside
of
dickens
no
pere
goriot
outside
of
balzac
these
illustrations
are
but
finite
examples
of
the
infinite
but
still
they
will
give
you
an
idea
of
the
truth
that
we
are
trying
to
unfold
in
your
mind
but
you
must
not
imagine
that
you
and
i
and
all
others
and
things
are
but
mere
imaginations
like
created
characters
that
would
be
a
most
unhappy
belief
the
mental
creations
held
by
you
and
i
and
other
finite
minds
are
but
creations
of
finite
while
we
ourselves
are
the
finite
creations
of
an
infinite
mind
while
our
and
dickens
and
balzac
and
creations
live
and
move
and
have
their
being
they
have
no
other
i
than
our
finite
minds
while
we
the
characters
in
the
divine
drama
story
or
epic
have
for
our
i
our
real
self
the
absolute
reality
they
have
merely
a
background
of
our
finite
personalities
and
minds
before
which
they
may
desport
themselves
until
alas
the
very
background
fades
away
to
dust
and
both
background
and
shadows
disappear
but
we
have
behind
our
personalities
the
eternal
background
of
reality
which
changeth
not
neither
doth
it
disappear
shadows
on
a
screen
though
our
personalities
may
be
yet
the
screen
is
real
and
eternal
take
away
the
finite
screen
and
the
shadows
disappear
but
our
screen
remains
forever
we
mental
images
in
the
infinite
mind
the
infinite
mind
holds
us
safe
we
can
not
be
lost
we
can
not
be
hurt
we
can
never
disappear
unless
we
be
absorbed
in
the
infinite
mind
itself
and
then
we
still
are
the
infinite
mind
never
forgets
it
never
can
overlook
us
it
is
aware
of
our
presence
and
being
always
we
are
safe
we
are
secure
we
are
just
as
we
could
not
be
created
from
nothing
so
we
can
not
be
converted
into
nothing
we
are
in
the
all
and
there
is
no
outside
at
the
dawn
of
the
brahmic
day
the
absolute
begins
the
creation
of
a
new
universe
or
the
recreation
of
one
just
as
you
may
care
to
state
it
the
highest
yogi
teachings
inform
us
that
the
information
relating
to
this
event
which
is
of
course
beyond
the
personal
knowledge
of
man
as
we
know
him
has
been
passed
down
to
the
race
from
teachers
who
have
received
it
from
still
higher
teachers
and
so
on
and
on
and
on
higher
and
higher
until
it
is
believed
to
have
originated
with
some
of
those
wonderfully
developed
souls
which
have
visited
the
earth
from
higher
planes
of
being
of
which
there
are
many
in
these
lessons
we
are
making
no
claims
of
this
sort
but
pass
on
the
teachings
to
you
believing
that
their
truth
will
appeal
to
those
who
are
ready
for
them
without
any
attempt
to
attribute
to
them
an
authority
such
as
just
mentioned
our
reference
to
this
high
source
of
the
teachings
was
made
because
of
its
general
acceptance
in
the
eastern
countries
and
by
occultists
generally
the
yogi
teachings
inform
us
that
in
the
beginning
the
absolute
formed
a
mental
image
or
of
an
universal
mind
that
is
of
an
universal
principle
of
mind
and
here
the
distinction
is
made
between
this
universal
mind
principle
or
universal
as
some
have
called
it
and
the
infinite
mind
itself
the
infinite
mind
is
something
infinitely
above
this
creation
of
the
universal
mind
principle
the
latter
being
as
much
an
emanation
as
is
matter
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
this
the
infinite
mind
is
spirit
the
universal
mind
principle
is
of
which
all
finite
mind
is
a
part
this
universal
mind
principle
was
the
first
conception
of
the
absolute
in
the
process
of
the
creation
of
the
universe
it
was
the
stuff
from
which
all
finite
mind
forms
and
is
formed
it
is
the
universal
mental
energy
know
it
as
such
but
do
not
confound
it
with
spirit
which
we
have
called
infinite
mind
because
we
had
no
other
term
there
is
a
subtle
difference
here
which
is
most
important
to
a
careful
understanding
of
the
subject
the
yogi
teachings
inform
us
that
from
this
mental
principle
there
was
developed
the
universal
principle
of
force
or
energy
and
that
from
this
universal
force
principle
there
developed
the
universal
principle
of
matter
the
sanscrit
terms
for
these
three
principles
are
as
follows
or
the
universal
mind
substance
or
principle
or
the
universal
energy
principle
and
or
the
universal
principle
of
matter
we
have
spoken
of
these
three
principles
or
three
great
manifestations
in
our
advanced
course
of
lessons
which
followed
our
fourteen
lessons
several
years
ago
but
it
becomes
necessary
for
us
to
refer
to
them
again
at
this
place
in
connection
with
the
present
presentation
of
the
subject
as
was
stated
in
the
lessons
just
mentioned
these
three
manifestations
or
principles
are
really
one
and
shade
into
each
other
this
matter
has
been
fully
touched
upon
in
the
concluding
lessons
of
the
aforesaid
advanced
course
to
which
we
must
refer
you
for
further
details
in
order
to
avoid
repetition
here
you
will
find
a
wonderful
correspondence
between
these
yogi
teachings
and
the
latest
conceptions
of
modern
science
well
to
return
to
the
main
path
once
more
the
teachings
inform
us
that
the
absolute
thought
into
being
that
is
held
the
mental
image
or
of
or
universal
mind
principle
this
was
finite
of
course
and
was
bound
and
governed
by
the
laws
of
finite
mind
imposed
upon
it
by
the
will
of
the
absolute
everything
that
is
finite
is
governed
by
laws
imposed
by
the
great
law
which
we
call
the
absolute
then
began
the
great
involution
which
was
necessary
before
evolution
was
possible
the
word
involve
you
know
means
to
wrap
up
to
cover
to
hide
etc
and
the
word
evolve
means
to
unwrap
to
unfold
to
etc
before
a
thing
can
be
evolved
or
unfolded
it
must
first
have
been
involved
or
or
wrapped
up
etc
everything
must
be
involved
before
it
can
be
evolved
remember
this
please
it
is
true
on
all
planes
mental
physical
and
spiritual
a
thing
must
be
put
in
before
it
may
be
taken
out
this
truth
if
remembered
and
applied
to
metaphysical
problems
will
throw
the
clearest
light
upon
the
darkest
problems
make
it
your
own
therefore
before
the
process
of
evolution
from
the
gross
forms
of
matter
up
to
the
higher
and
then
on
to
the
mental
from
higher
to
higher
and
then
on
the
spiritual
plane
that
evolution
which
we
see
being
performed
before
our
sight
today
before
that
evolution
became
possible
there
was
a
necessary
involution
or
the
spirit
of
the
absolute
first
involved
itself
in
its
mental
image
or
creation
of
the
mind
principle
just
as
you
may
involve
yourself
in
an
earnest
thought
in
deep
meditation
did
you
never
lose
yourself
in
thought
or
forget
yourself
in
an
idea
have
you
not
spoken
of
yourself
as
having
been
wrapped
in
thought
well
then
you
can
see
something
of
what
is
here
meant
at
least
so
far
as
the
process
of
involution
is
concerned
you
involve
yourself
in
your
meditations
the
absolute
involves
itself
in
its
mental
creations
but
remember
the
one
is
finite
and
the
other
infinite
and
the
results
are
correspondingly
weak
or
strong
obeying
the
laws
imposed
upon
it
the
mental
principle
then
involved
itself
in
the
energy
principle
or
and
the
universal
energy
sprang
into
existence
then
in
obedience
to
the
same
laws
the
involved
itself
in
the
or
universal
matter
principle
of
course
each
involving
practically
created
the
wrapper
sheath
of
the
lower
principle
do
you
see
this
each
therefore
depends
upon
the
principle
higher
than
itself
which
becomes
its
parent
principle
as
the
yogis
express
it
and
in
this
process
of
involution
the
extreme
form
of
matter
was
reached
before
the
process
of
evolution
became
possible
the
extreme
form
of
gross
matter
is
not
known
to
us
today
on
this
planet
for
we
have
passed
beyond
it
but
the
teachings
inform
us
that
such
forms
were
as
much
grosser
that
the
grossest
matter
that
we
know
today
as
the
latter
is
gross
in
comparison
with
the
most
ethereal
vapors
known
to
modern
science
the
human
mind
can
not
grasp
this
extreme
of
the
scale
any
more
than
it
can
the
extreme
high
degree
of
manifestation
at
this
point
we
must
call
your
attention
to
certain
occult
teachings
widely
disseminated
which
the
highest
yogi
teachers
discountenance
and
contradict
we
allude
to
the
teaching
that
in
the
process
of
involution
there
was
a
degeneration
or
devolution
from
higher
to
lower
forms
of
life
until
the
gross
state
of
matter
was
reached
such
a
teaching
is
horrible
when
considered
in
detail
it
would
mean
that
the
absolute
deliberately
created
high
forms
of
life
and
higher
than
these
gods
in
fact
and
then
caused
them
to
devolve
until
the
lowest
state
was
reached
this
would
mean
the
exact
opposite
of
evolution
and
would
mean
a
going
down
in
accordance
with
the
divine
will
just
as
evolution
is
a
going
up
in
accordance
with
the
divine
will
this
is
contrary
to
man
best
instincts
and
the
advanced
yogi
teachings
inform
us
that
it
is
but
an
illusion
or
error
that
men
have
created
by
endeavoring
to
solve
spiritual
mysteries
by
purely
intellectual
processes
the
true
teaching
is
that
the
process
of
involution
was
accomplished
by
a
principle
involving
itself
in
the
lower
principle
created
within
itself
and
so
on
until
the
lowest
plane
was
reached
note
the
difference
principles
as
principles
did
this
and
not
as
individual
forms
of
life
or
being
there
was
no
more
a
devolution
in
this
process
than
there
was
in
the
absolute
involving
itself
in
the
mental
image
of
the
mind
principle
there
was
no
devolution
or
going
down
only
an
involution
or
wrapping
up
of
principle
within
principle
the
individual
life
not
having
as
yet
appeared
and
not
being
possible
of
appearance
until
the
evolutionary
process
began
we
trust
that
we
have
made
this
point
clear
to
you
for
it
is
an
important
matter
if
the
absolute
first
made
higher
beings
and
then
caused
them
to
devolute
into
lower
and
lower
forms
then
the
whole
process
would
be
a
cruel
purposeless
thing
worthy
only
of
some
of
the
base
conceptions
of
deity
conceived
of
by
men
in
their
ignorance
no
the
whole
effort
of
the
divine
will
seems
to
be
in
the
direction
of
raising
up
individual
egos
to
higher
and
still
higher
forms
and
in
order
to
produce
such
egos
the
process
of
involution
of
principles
seems
to
have
been
caused
and
the
subsequent
wonderful
evolutionary
process
instituted
what
that
reason
is
is
unknowable
as
we
have
said
over
and
over
again
we
can
not
pry
into
the
infinite
mind
of
the
absolute
but
we
may
form
certain
conclusions
by
observing
and
studying
the
laws
of
the
universe
which
seem
to
be
moving
in
certain
directions
from
the
manifested
will
of
the
divine
one
we
may
at
least
hazard
an
idea
as
to
its
purposes
and
these
purposes
seem
to
be
always
in
an
upward
lifting
and
evolution
even
the
coming
of
the
night
of
brahm
is
no
exception
to
this
statement
as
we
shall
see
in
future
lessons
from
the
starting
of
the
process
of
involution
from
the
mental
principle
down
to
the
extreme
downward
point
of
the
grossest
manifestation
of
matter
there
were
many
stages
from
the
highest
degree
of
the
finite
mind
down
to
lower
and
still
lower
degrees
then
on
to
the
plane
of
force
and
energy
from
higher
to
lower
degrees
of
principle
within
principle
then
on
to
the
plane
of
matter
the
involutionary
urge
proceeded
to
work
when
the
plane
of
matter
was
reached
it
of
course
showed
its
highest
degree
of
manifested
matter
the
most
subtle
form
of
ether
or
then
down
down
down
went
the
degrees
of
matter
until
the
grossest
possible
form
was
reached
and
then
there
was
a
moment
pause
before
the
evolutionary
process
or
began
the
impulse
of
the
original
will
or
thought
had
exhausted
its
downward
urge
and
now
began
the
upward
urge
or
tendency
but
here
was
manifested
a
new
feature
this
new
feature
was
the
tendency
toward
individualization
during
the
downward
trend
the
movement
was
that
is
by
principle
as
without
any
splitting
up
into
portions
or
centers
but
with
the
first
upward
movement
there
was
evidenced
a
tendency
toward
creating
centers
of
energy
or
units
of
activity
which
then
manifested
itself
as
the
evolutionary
movement
continued
from
electrons
to
atoms
from
atoms
to
man
the
gross
matter
was
used
as
material
for
the
formation
of
finer
and
more
complex
forms
and
these
in
turn
combined
and
formed
higher
and
so
on
and
on
and
the
forms
of
energy
operated
in
the
same
way
and
the
manifestations
of
centers
of
mind
or
consciousness
in
the
same
way
but
all
in
connection
matter
energy
and
mind
formed
a
trinity
of
principles
and
worked
in
connection
and
the
work
was
always
in
the
direction
of
causing
higher
and
higher
forms
to
arise
higher
and
higher
units
higher
and
higher
centers
but
in
every
form
center
or
unit
there
was
manifested
the
three
principles
mind
energy
and
matter
and
within
each
was
the
ever
present
spirit
for
spirit
be
in
all
just
as
all
must
be
in
spirit
and
so
this
evolutionary
process
has
continued
ever
since
and
must
continue
for
aeons
yet
the
absolute
is
raising
itself
up
into
itself
higher
and
higher
egos
and
is
providing
them
with
higher
and
higher
sheaths
in
which
to
manifest
and
as
we
shall
see
in
these
lessons
as
we
progress
this
evolution
is
not
only
along
the
physical
lines
but
also
along
the
mental
and
it
concerns
itself
not
only
with
bodies
but
with
souls
which
also
evolve
from
time
to
time
and
bodies
are
given
these
souls
in
order
that
they
may
work
out
their
evolution
and
the
whole
end
and
aim
of
it
all
seems
to
be
that
egos
may
reach
the
stage
where
they
are
conscious
of
the
real
self
of
the
spirit
within
them
and
its
relation
to
the
spirit
of
the
absolute
and
then
go
on
and
on
and
on
to
planes
of
life
and
being
and
activities
of
which
even
the
most
advanced
of
the
race
may
only
dream
as
some
of
the
ancient
yogi
teachers
have
said
men
are
evolving
into
and
into
gods
and
gods
into
and
into
something
still
higher
until
from
the
lowest
bit
of
matter
enclosing
life
unto
the
highest
being
yea
even
unto
the
absolute
there
is
an
infinite
ladder
of
being
and
yet
the
one
spirit
pervades
all
is
in
all
as
the
all
is
in
it
the
creative
will
of
which
we
have
spoken
in
these
lessons
is
in
full
operation
all
through
life
the
natural
laws
are
laws
of
life
imposed
by
the
absolute
in
his
mental
image
they
are
the
natural
laws
of
this
universe
just
as
other
universes
have
other
laws
but
the
absolute
itself
has
no
laws
affecting
it
it
in
itself
law
and
these
laws
of
life
and
nature
along
its
varying
planes
material
of
energy
and
mental
are
also
in
the
divine
mind
else
they
would
not
be
at
all
even
in
appearance
and
when
they
are
transcended
or
apparently
defied
by
some
man
of
advanced
development
it
is
only
because
such
a
man
is
able
to
rise
above
the
plane
upon
which
such
laws
are
operative
but
even
this
transcending
is
in
itself
in
accordance
with
some
higher
law
and
so
we
see
that
all
high
and
low
good
and
bad
simple
or
complex
all
are
contained
within
the
mind
of
the
one
gods
angels
adepts
sages
heavens
planes
all
everything
is
within
the
universe
and
the
universe
is
within
the
mind
of
the
one
and
all
is
proceeding
in
accordance
with
law
and
all
is
moving
upward
and
onward
along
the
lines
of
evolution
all
is
well
we
are
held
firmly
in
the
mind
of
the
one
and
just
as
the
tendency
was
from
the
general
principle
toward
the
particular
individual
soul
so
is
there
a
reconciliation
later
on
for
the
individual
soul
as
it
develops
and
unfolds
loses
its
sense
of
separateness
and
begins
to
feel
its
identity
with
the
one
spirit
and
moves
along
the
lines
of
unfoldment
until
it
becomes
in
conscious
union
with
god
spiritual
evolution
does
not
mean
the
growth
of
the
spirit
for
the
spirit
can
not
grow
it
is
already
perfect
the
term
means
the
unfoldment
of
the
individual
mind
until
it
can
recognize
the
spirit
within
let
us
close
this
lesson
with
the
central
thought
there
is
but
one
that
one
is
spirit
in
the
infinite
mind
of
that
one
spirit
there
arose
the
mental
image
or
of
this
universe
beginning
with
the
thought
of
the
principle
in
mind
and
passing
on
to
the
principle
of
energy
and
then
on
to
the
principle
of
matter
proceeded
the
involutionary
process
of
creation
then
upward
began
the
evolutionary
process
and
individual
centers
or
units
were
formed
and
the
tendency
and
evolutionary
urge
is
ever
in
the
direction
of
unfolding
within
the
ego
of
the
realization
of
the
indwelling
spirit
as
we
throw
off
sheath
after
sheath
we
approach
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
spirit
within
us
which
is
the
one
spirit
pervading
all
things
this
is
the
meaning
of
life
the
secret
of
evolution
all
the
universe
is
contained
within
the
mind
of
the
one
there
is
nothing
outside
of
that
infinite
mind
there
is
no
outside
for
the
one
is
all
in
all
space
time
and
laws
being
but
mental
images
in
that
mind
as
are
likewise
all
shapes
and
forms
and
phenomena
and
as
the
ego
unfolds
into
a
realization
of
itself
its
real
self
so
does
its
wisdom
and
power
expand
it
thus
enters
into
a
greater
and
greater
degree
of
its
inheritance
within
the
mind
of
the
one
is
all
there
is
and
i
and
thou
and
all
things
are
here
within
that
infinite
mind
we
are
always
held
in
mind
by
the
absolute
are
always
safe
here
there
is
nothing
to
harm
us
in
reality
for
our
real
self
is
the
real
self
of
the
infinite
mind
all
is
within
the
mind
of
the
one
even
the
tiniest
atom
is
under
the
law
and
protected
by
the
law
and
the
law
is
all
there
is
and
in
that
law
we
may
rest
content
and
unafraid
may
this
realization
be
yours
peace
be
with
you
all
the
seventh
lesson
cosmic
evolution
we
have
now
reached
a
most
interesting
point
in
this
course
of
lessons
and
a
period
of
fascinating
study
lies
before
us
from
now
until
the
close
of
the
course
we
have
acquainted
ourselves
with
the
fundamental
principles
and
will
now
proceed
to
witness
these
principles
in
active
operation
we
have
studied
the
yogi
teachings
concerning
the
truth
underlying
all
things
and
shall
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
the
process
of
cosmic
evolution
the
cyclic
laws
the
law
of
spiritual
evolution
or
reincarnation
the
law
of
spiritual
cause
and
effect
or
etc
in
this
lesson
we
begin
the
story
of
the
upward
progress
of
the
universe
and
its
forms
shapes
and
forces
from
the
point
of
the
moment
pause
following
the
ceasing
of
the
process
of
involution
the
point
at
which
cosmic
evolution
begins
our
progress
is
now
steadily
upward
so
far
as
the
evolution
of
individual
centres
is
concerned
we
shall
see
the
principles
returning
to
the
principle
the
centres
returning
to
the
great
centre
from
which
they
emanated
during
the
process
of
involution
we
shall
study
the
long
gradual
but
steady
ascent
of
man
in
his
journey
toward
we
shall
see
the
building
of
an
universe
and
the
growth
of
the
soul
in
our
last
lesson
we
have
seen
that
at
the
dawn
of
a
brahmic
day
the
absolute
begins
the
creation
of
a
new
universe
the
teachings
inform
us
that
in
the
beginning
the
absolute
forms
a
mental
image
or
of
an
universal
mind
principle
or
universal
as
some
of
the
teachers
express
it
then
this
universal
mind
principle
creates
within
itself
the
universal
energy
principle
then
this
universal
energy
principle
creates
within
itself
the
universal
matter
principle
thus
energy
is
a
product
of
mind
and
matter
a
product
of
energy
the
teachings
then
further
inform
us
that
from
the
rare
tenuous
subtle
form
of
matter
in
which
the
universal
matter
principle
first
appeared
there
was
produced
forms
of
matter
less
rare
and
so
by
easy
stages
and
degrees
there
appeared
grosser
and
still
grosser
forms
of
matter
until
finally
there
could
be
no
further
involution
into
grosser
forms
and
the
involutionary
process
ceased
then
ensued
the
pause
of
which
the
yogi
teachers
tell
us
at
that
point
matter
existed
as
much
grosser
that
the
grossest
form
of
matter
now
known
to
us
as
the
latter
is
when
compared
to
the
most
subtle
vapors
known
to
science
it
is
impossible
to
describe
these
lower
forms
of
matter
for
they
have
ages
since
disappeared
from
view
and
we
would
have
no
words
with
which
to
describe
them
we
can
understand
the
situation
only
by
comparisons
similar
to
the
above
succeeding
the
moment
pause
there
began
the
evolutionary
process
or
cosmic
evolution
which
has
gone
on
ever
since
and
which
will
go
on
for
ages
to
come
from
the
grossest
forms
of
matter
there
evolved
forms
a
little
more
refined
and
so
on
and
on
from
the
simple
elementarv
forms
evolved
more
complex
and
intricate
forms
and
from
these
forms
combinations
began
to
be
formed
and
the
urge
was
ever
upward
but
remember
this
that
all
of
this
evolutionary
process
is
but
a
returning
home
it
is
the
ascent
after
the
descent
it
is
not
a
creation
but
an
unfoldment
the
descent
was
made
by
principles
as
principles
the
ascent
is
being
made
by
individualized
centres
evolved
from
the
principles
matter
manifests
finer
and
finer
forms
and
exhibits
a
greater
and
greater
subservience
to
energy
or
force
and
energy
or
force
shows
a
greater
and
greater
degree
of
mind
in
it
but
remember
this
that
there
is
mind
in
even
the
grossest
form
of
matter
this
must
be
so
for
what
springs
from
a
thing
must
contain
the
elements
of
its
cause
and
the
cosmic
evolution
continues
and
must
continue
for
aeons
of
time
higher
and
higher
forms
of
mind
are
being
manifested
and
still
higher
and
higher
forms
will
appear
in
the
scale
as
the
process
continues
the
evolution
is
not
only
along
material
lines
but
has
passed
on
to
the
mental
planes
and
is
now
operating
along
the
spiritual
lines
as
well
and
the
end
and
aim
seems
to
be
that
each
ego
after
the
experiences
of
many
lives
may
unfold
and
develop
to
a
point
where
it
may
become
conscious
of
its
real
self
and
realize
its
identity
with
the
one
life
and
the
spirit
at
this
point
we
may
be
confronted
with
the
objection
of
the
student
of
material
science
who
will
ask
why
we
begin
our
consideration
of
cosmic
evolution
at
a
point
in
which
matter
has
reached
the
limit
of
its
lowest
vibrations
manifesting
in
the
grossest
possible
form
of
matter
these
students
may
point
to
the
fact
that
science
begins
its
consideration
of
evolution
with
the
or
faint
cloudlike
vaporous
matter
from
which
the
planets
were
formed
but
there
is
only
an
apparent
contradiction
here
the
were
part
of
the
process
of
involution
and
science
is
right
when
it
holds
that
the
gross
forms
were
produced
from
the
finer
but
the
process
of
change
from
finer
to
grosser
was
not
evolution
do
you
see
the
difference
evolution
begins
at
the
point
when
the
stage
of
unfoldment
commenced
when
the
gross
forms
begin
to
yield
to
the
new
upward
urge
and
unfold
into
finer
forms
then
begins
evolution
we
shall
pass
over
the
period
of
evolution
in
which
matter
was
evolving
into
finer
and
still
finer
forms
until
at
last
it
reached
a
degree
of
vibration
capable
of
supporting
that
which
we
call
life
of
course
there
is
life
in
all
matter
even
in
the
atom
as
we
have
shown
in
previous
lessons
but
when
we
speak
of
life
as
we
now
do
we
mean
what
are
generally
called
living
forms
the
yogi
teachings
inform
us
that
the
lowest
forms
of
what
we
call
life
were
evolved
from
forms
of
high
crystal
life
which
indeed
they
very
much
resemble
we
have
spoken
of
this
resemblance
in
the
previous
lessons
of
this
series
and
so
we
shall
begin
at
the
point
where
living
forms
began
speaking
now
of
our
own
planet
the
earth
we
find
matter
emerging
from
the
molten
state
in
which
it
manifested
for
ages
gradually
cooling
and
stratifying
the
earth
contained
none
of
those
forms
that
we
call
living
forms
the
temperature
of
the
earth
in
that
period
is
estimated
at
about
times
hotter
than
boiling
water
which
would
of
course
render
impossible
the
existence
of
any
of
the
present
known
forms
of
life
but
the
yogi
teachings
inform
us
that
even
in
the
molten
mass
there
were
elementary
forms
that
were
to
become
the
ancestral
forms
of
the
later
living
forms
these
elementary
forms
were
composed
of
a
vaporous
peculiar
form
of
matter
of
minute
size
little
more
than
the
atoms
in
fact
and
yet
just
a
little
more
advanced
from
these
elementary
forms
there
gradually
evolved
as
the
earth
cooled
and
solidified
other
forms
and
so
on
until
at
last
the
first
living
form
manifested
as
the
globe
cooled
at
the
poles
there
was
gradually
created
a
tropical
climate
in
which
the
temperature
was
sufficiently
cool
to
support
certain
rudimentary
forms
of
life
in
the
rocks
in
the
far
northern
latitudes
there
are
found
abundant
traces
of
fossils
which
goes
to
prove
the
correctness
of
the
yogi
teachings
of
the
origin
of
life
at
the
north
pole
from
which
the
living
forms
gradually
spread
south
toward
the
equator
as
the
earth
surface
cooled
the
elementary
evolving
life
forms
were
of
a
very
simple
structure
and
were
but
a
degree
above
the
crystals
they
were
composed
of
identically
the
same
substance
as
the
crystals
only
difference
being
that
they
displayed
a
greater
degree
of
for
that
matter
even
the
highest
physical
form
known
to
us
today
is
composed
of
simple
chemical
materials
and
these
chemical
materials
are
obtained
either
directly
or
indirectly
from
the
air
water
or
earth
the
principal
materials
composing
the
physical
bodies
of
plants
animals
and
man
are
oxygen
carbon
hydrogen
nitrogen
with
a
still
smaller
proportion
of
sulphur
and
phosphorus
and
traces
of
a
few
other
elements
the
material
part
of
all
living
things
is
alike
the
difference
lies
in
the
degree
of
mind
controlling
the
matter
in
which
it
is
embodied
of
these
physical
materials
carbon
is
the
most
important
to
the
living
forms
it
seems
to
possess
properties
capable
of
drawing
to
it
the
other
elements
and
forcing
them
into
service
from
carbon
proceeds
what
is
called
protoplasm
the
material
of
which
the
cells
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
is
composed
from
protoplasm
the
almost
infinite
varieties
of
living
forms
have
been
built
up
by
the
process
of
evolution
working
gradually
and
by
easy
stages
every
living
form
is
made
up
or
composed
of
a
multitude
of
single
cells
and
their
combinations
and
every
form
originates
in
a
single
cell
which
rapidly
multiplies
and
reproduces
itself
until
the
form
of
the
amoeba
the
plant
the
animal
the
man
is
completed
all
living
forms
are
but
a
single
cell
multiplied
and
every
cell
is
composed
of
protoplasm
therefore
we
must
look
for
the
beginning
of
life
in
the
grade
of
matter
called
protoplasm
in
this
both
modern
science
and
the
yogi
teachings
agree
fully
in
investigating
protoplasm
we
are
made
to
realize
the
wonderful
qualities
of
its
principal
constituent
carbon
carbon
is
the
wonder
worker
of
the
elements
manifesting
in
various
forms
as
the
diamond
graphite
coal
protoplasm
is
it
not
entitled
to
respect
the
yogi
teachings
inform
vis
that
in
carbon
we
have
that
form
of
matter
which
was
evolved
as
the
physical
basis
of
life
if
any
of
you
doubt
that
inorganic
matter
may
be
transformed
into
living
forms
let
us
refer
you
to
the
plant
life
in
which
you
may
see
the
plants
building
up
cells
every
day
from
the
inorganic
chemical
or
mineral
substances
in
the
earth
air
and
water
nature
performs
every
day
the
miracle
of
transforming
chemicals
and
minerals
into
living
plant
cells
and
when
animal
or
man
eats
these
plant
cells
so
produced
they
become
transformed
into
animal
cells
of
which
the
body
is
built
up
what
it
took
nature
ages
to
do
in
the
beginning
is
now
performed
in
a
few
hours
or
minutes
the
yogi
teachings
again
on
with
modern
science
inform
us
that
living
forms
had
their
beginning
in
water
in
the
slimy
bed
of
the
polar
seas
the
simple
appeared
having
their
origin
in
the
transitional
stages
before
mentioned
the
first
living
forms
were
a
lowly
form
of
plant
life
consisting
of
a
single
cell
from
these
forms
were
evolved
forms
composed
of
groups
of
cells
and
so
proceeded
the
work
of
evolution
from
the
lower
form
to
the
higher
ever
in
an
upward
path
as
we
have
said
the
single
cell
is
the
physical
centre
or
parent
of
every
living
form
it
contains
what
is
known
as
the
or
kernel
which
seems
to
be
more
highly
organized
than
the
rest
of
the
material
of
the
cell
it
may
be
considered
as
the
brain
of
the
cell
if
you
wish
to
use
your
imagination
a
little
the
single
cell
reproduces
itself
by
growth
and
division
or
separation
each
cell
manifests
the
functions
of
life
whether
it
be
a
creature
or
a
cell
which
with
billions
of
others
goes
to
make
up
a
higher
form
it
feels
feeds
grows
and
reproduces
itself
in
the
creature
the
one
cell
performs
all
of
the
functions
of
course
but
as
the
forms
become
more
complex
the
many
cells
composing
a
form
perform
certain
functions
which
are
allotted
to
it
the
division
of
labor
resulting
in
a
higher
manifestation
this
is
true
not
only
in
the
case
of
animal
forms
but
also
in
the
case
of
plant
forms
the
cells
in
the
bone
muscle
and
blood
of
the
animal
differ
according
to
their
offices
and
the
same
is
true
in
the
cells
in
the
sap
stem
root
leaf
seed
and
flower
of
the
plant
as
we
have
said
the
cells
multiply
by
division
after
a
period
of
growth
the
cell
grows
by
material
taken
into
its
substance
as
food
when
sufficient
food
has
been
partaken
and
enough
new
material
accumulated
to
cause
the
cell
to
attain
a
certain
size
then
it
divides
or
separates
into
two
cells
the
division
being
equal
and
the
point
of
cleavage
being
at
the
kernel
or
nucleus
as
the
two
parts
separate
the
protoplasm
each
groups
itself
around
its
nucleus
and
two
living
forms
exist
where
there
was
but
one
a
moment
before
and
then
each
of
the
two
cells
proceed
to
grow
rapidly
and
then
separate
and
so
on
to
the
end
each
cell
multiplying
into
millions
as
time
passes
ascending
in
the
scale
we
next
find
the
living
forms
composed
of
these
are
formed
by
single
cells
dividing
and
then
subdividing
but
instead
of
passing
on
their
way
they
group
themselves
in
clusters
or
masses
there
are
millions
of
forms
of
these
creatures
among
which
we
find
the
sponges
polyps
etc
in
the
early
forms
of
life
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
between
the
animal
and
the
plant
forms
in
fact
the
early
forms
partake
of
the
qualities
of
both
but
as
we
advance
in
the
scale
a
little
there
is
seen
a
decided
branching
out
and
one
large
branch
is
formed
of
the
evolving
plant
forms
and
the
other
of
the
evolving
animal
forms
the
begins
with
the
and
passes
on
to
the
fungi
lichens
mosses
ferns
pines
and
grasses
then
to
the
trees
shrubs
and
herbs
the
begins
with
the
or
forms
which
are
little
more
than
a
drop
of
sticky
protoplasm
then
it
passes
on
to
the
which
begins
to
show
a
slight
difference
in
its
parts
then
on
the
which
secretes
a
shell
of
lime
from
the
water
then
on
a
step
higher
to
the
which
secretes
a
shell
or
skeleton
of
material
from
the
water
then
come
the
sponges
then
the
anemones
and
then
come
the
etc
then
the
various
families
of
worms
then
the
crabs
spiders
centipedes
insects
then
come
the
mollusca
which
include
the
oysters
clams
and
other
snails
etc
all
of
the
above
families
of
are
what
are
known
as
invertebrates
that
is
without
a
backbone
then
we
come
to
the
vertebrates
or
animals
having
a
backbone
first
we
see
the
fish
family
with
its
thousands
of
forms
then
come
the
amphibia
which
include
the
toads
frogs
etc
then
come
the
reptiles
which
include
the
serpents
lizards
crocodiles
turtles
etc
then
come
the
great
family
of
birds
with
its
wonderful
variety
of
forms
sizes
and
characteristics
then
come
the
mammals
the
name
of
which
comes
from
the
latin
word
meaning
the
breast
the
characteristic
of
which
group
comes
from
the
fact
that
they
nourish
their
young
by
milk
or
similar
fluid
secreted
by
the
mother
the
mammals
are
the
highest
form
of
the
vertebrates
first
among
the
mammals
we
find
the
aplacentals
or
those
which
bring
forth
immature
young
which
are
grouped
into
two
divisions
the
or
animals
in
which
group
belong
the
spiny
etc
and
the
or
pouched
animals
in
which
group
belong
the
kangaroo
opossum
etc
the
next
highest
form
among
the
mammals
are
known
as
the
or
those
which
bring
forth
mature
young
in
this
class
are
found
the
sloth
manatee
the
whale
and
porpoise
the
horse
cow
sheep
and
other
hoofed
animals
the
elephant
seal
the
dog
wolf
lion
tiger
and
all
flesh
eating
animals
the
hares
rats
mice
and
ail
other
gnawing
animals
the
bats
moles
and
other
then
come
the
great
family
of
apes
from
the
small
monkeys
up
to
the
chimpanzee
and
other
forms
nearly
approaching
man
and
then
comes
the
highest
man
from
the
kaffir
and
digger
indian
up
through
the
many
stages
until
the
highest
forms
of
our
own
race
are
reached
from
the
monera
to
man
is
a
long
path
containing
many
stages
but
it
is
a
path
including
all
the
intermediate
forms
the
yogi
teachings
hold
to
the
theory
of
evolution
as
maintained
by
modern
science
but
it
goes
still
further
for
it
holds
not
only
that
the
physical
forms
are
subject
to
the
evolutionary
process
but
that
also
the
souls
embodied
in
these
forms
are
subject
to
the
evolutionary
process
in
other
words
the
yogi
teachings
hold
that
there
is
a
of
evolution
under
way
the
main
object
of
which
is
to
develop
souls
but
which
also
finds
it
necessary
to
evolve
higher
and
higher
forms
of
physical
bodies
for
these
constantly
advancing
souls
to
occupy
let
us
take
a
hasty
glance
at
the
ascending
forms
of
animal
life
as
they
rise
in
the
evolutionary
scale
by
so
doing
we
can
witness
the
growth
of
the
soul
within
them
as
manifested
by
the
higher
and
higher
physical
forms
which
are
used
as
channels
of
expression
by
the
souls
within
let
us
first
study
from
the
outer
viewpoint
before
we
proceed
to
examine
it
from
the
inner
by
so
doing
we
will
have
a
fuller
idea
of
the
process
than
if
we
ignored
the
outer
and
proceed
at
once
to
the
inner
despise
not
the
outer
form
for
it
has
always
been
and
is
now
the
temple
of
the
soul
which
the
latter
is
remodelling
and
rebuilding
in
order
to
accommodate
its
constantly
increasing
needs
and
demands
let
us
begin
with
the
or
forms
the
lowest
form
of
animal
life
the
lowest
form
of
this
lowest
class
is
that
remarkable
creature
that
we
have
mentioned
in
previous
lessons
the
this
creature
lives
in
water
the
natural
element
in
which
organic
life
is
believed
to
have
had
its
beginning
it
is
a
very
tiny
shapeless
colorless
slimy
sticky
mass
something
like
a
tiny
drop
of
glue
alike
all
over
and
in
its
mass
and
without
organs
or
parts
of
any
kind
some
have
claimed
that
below
the
field
of
the
microscope
there
may
be
something
like
elementary
organs
in
the
moneron
but
so
far
as
the
human
eye
may
discover
there
is
no
evidence
of
anything
of
the
kind
it
has
no
organs
or
parts
with
which
to
perform
particular
functions
as
is
the
case
with
the
higher
forms
of
life
these
functions
as
you
know
may
be
classed
into
three
groups
nutrition
reproduction
and
relation
that
is
the
function
of
feeding
the
function
of
reproducing
its
kind
and
the
function
of
receiving
and
responding
to
the
impressions
of
the
outside
world
all
of
these
three
classes
of
functions
the
moneron
performs
but
any
part
of
its
body
or
with
all
of
every
part
or
the
whole
of
the
moneron
absorbs
food
and
oxygen
it
is
all
mouth
and
lungs
every
part
or
the
whole
digests
the
food
it
is
all
stomach
every
part
or
the
whole
performs
the
reproductive
function
it
is
all
reproductive
organism
every
part
of
it
senses
the
impressions
from
outside
and
responds
to
it
it
is
all
organs
of
sense
and
organs
of
motion
it
envelops
its
prey
as
a
drop
of
glue
surrounds
a
particle
of
sand
and
then
absorbs
the
substance
of
the
prey
into
its
own
substance
it
moves
by
prolonging
any
part
of
itself
outward
in
a
sort
of
appendage
which
it
uses
as
a
foot
or
finger
with
which
to
propel
itself
draw
itself
to
or
push
itself
away
from
an
object
this
prolongation
is
called
a
or
when
it
gets
through
using
the
for
the
particular
purpose
it
simply
draws
back
into
itself
that
portion
which
had
been
protruded
for
the
purpose
it
performs
the
functions
of
digestion
assimilation
elimination
perfectly
just
as
the
higher
forms
of
life
but
it
has
no
organs
for
the
functions
and
performs
them
severally
and
collectively
with
any
or
all
parts
of
its
body
what
the
higher
animals
perform
with
intricate
organs
and
parts
heart
stomach
lungs
liver
kidneys
this
tiny
creature
performs
and
with
its
entire
body
or
any
part
thereof
the
function
of
reproduction
is
startlingly
simple
in
the
case
of
the
moneron
it
simply
divides
itself
in
two
parts
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
there
is
no
male
or
female
sex
in
its
case
it
combines
both
within
itself
the
reproductive
process
is
even
far
more
simple
than
the
budding
of
plants
you
may
turn
one
of
these
wonderful
creatures
inside
out
and
still
it
goes
on
the
even
tenor
of
its
way
in
no
manner
disturbed
or
affected
it
is
simply
a
living
drop
of
glue
which
eats
digests
receives
impressions
and
responds
thereto
and
reproduces
itself
this
tiny
performs
virtually
the
same
life
functions
as
do
the
higher
complex
forms
of
living
things
which
is
the
greater
miracle
the
moneron
or
man
a
slight
step
upward
from
the
moneron
brings
us
to
the
the
name
of
this
new
creature
is
derived
from
the
greek
word
meaning
change
and
has
been
bestowed
because
the
creature
is
constantly
changing
its
shape
this
continual
change
of
shape
is
caused
by
a
continuous
prolongation
and
of
its
pseudopods
or
which
also
gives
the
creature
the
appearance
of
a
organism
this
creature
shows
the
first
step
toward
parts
for
it
has
something
like
a
membrane
or
skin
at
its
surface
and
a
nucleus
at
its
centre
and
also
an
expanding
and
contracting
cavity
within
its
substance
which
it
uses
for
holding
digesting
and
distributing
its
food
and
also
for
storing
and
distributing
its
oxygen
an
elementary
combination
of
stomach
and
lungs
so
you
see
that
the
amoeba
has
taken
a
step
upward
from
the
moneron
and
is
beginning
to
appreciate
the
convenience
of
parts
and
organs
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
this
connection
that
while
the
ordinary
cells
of
the
higher
animal
body
resemble
the
in
many
ways
still
the
white
corpuscles
in
the
blood
of
man
and
the
animals
bear
a
startling
resemblance
to
the
so
far
as
regards
size
general
structure
and
movements
and
are
in
fact
known
to
science
as
amoeboids
the
white
corpuscles
change
their
shape
take
in
food
in
an
intelligent
manner
and
live
a
comparatively
independent
life
their
movements
showing
independent
thought
and
will
some
of
the
amoebae
the
diatoms
for
instance
secrete
solid
matter
from
the
water
and
build
therefrom
shells
or
houses
which
serve
to
protect
them
from
their
enemies
these
shells
are
full
of
tiny
holes
through
which
the
pseudopods
are
extended
in
their
search
for
food
and
for
purposes
of
movement
some
of
these
shells
are
composed
of
secreted
lime
and
others
of
a
flinty
substance
the
selection
of
these
substances
from
the
ether
mineral
particles
in
the
water
evidencing
a
degree
cf
thought
and
mind
even
in
these
lowly
creatures
the
skeletons
of
these
tiny
creatures
form
vast
deposits
of
chalk
and
similar
substances
next
higher
in
the
scale
are
the
these
creatures
differ
from
the
amoebae
inasmuch
as
instead
of
pseudopods
they
have
developed
tiny
vibrating
filaments
or
appendages
which
are
used
for
drawing
in
their
prey
and
for
moving
about
these
filaments
are
permanent
and
are
not
temporary
like
the
pseudopods
of
the
monera
or
amoebae
they
are
the
signs
of
permanent
hands
and
these
creatures
have
also
discovered
the
possibilities
of
organs
and
parts
to
a
still
greater
degree
than
have
their
cousins
the
amoebae
and
have
evolved
something
like
a
very
rudimentary
and
also
a
short
gullet
through
which
they
pass
their
food
and
oxygen
have
developed
the
first
signs
of
a
throat
and
next
come
the
family
of
sponges
the
soft
skeletons
of
which
form
the
useful
article
of
everyday
use
there
are
many
forms
who
weave
a
home
of
far
more
delicacy
and
beauty
than
their
more
familiar
and
homely
brothers
the
sponge
creature
itself
is
a
slimy
soft
creature
which
fills
in
the
spaces
in
its
spongy
skeleton
it
is
fastened
to
one
spot
and
gathers
in
its
food
from
the
water
around
it
and
oxygen
as
well
by
means
of
numerous
filaments
called
which
flash
through
the
water
driving
in
the
food
and
oxygen
to
the
inner
positions
of
its
body
the
water
thus
drawn
in
as
well
as
the
refuse
from
the
food
is
then
driven
out
in
the
same
manner
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
organisms
of
the
higher
animals
including
man
there
are
numerous
performing
offices
in
connection
with
nutrition
etc
when
nature
perfects
an
instrument
it
is
very
apt
to
retain
it
even
in
the
higher
forms
although
in
the
latter
its
importance
may
be
dwarfed
by
higher
ones
the
next
step
in
the
ascending
scale
of
is
occupied
by
the
which
are
found
in
water
fastened
to
floating
matter
the
polyps
fasten
themselves
to
this
floating
matter
with
their
mouths
downward
from
the
latter
dangling
certain
tentacles
or
thin
long
arms
these
tentacles
contain
small
coils
in
contact
with
a
poisonous
fluid
and
enclosed
in
a
cell
when
the
tentacles
come
in
contact
with
the
prey
of
the
creature
or
with
anything
that
is
sensed
as
a
possible
enemy
they
contract
around
the
object
and
the
little
cells
burst
and
the
tiny
coils
are
released
and
twist
themselves
like
a
loop
around
the
object
poisoning
it
with
the
secreted
fluid
some
of
the
polyps
secrete
tubes
which
they
inhabit
and
from
the
ends
of
which
they
emerge
like
flowers
from
these
parent
polyps
emerge
clusters
of
young
resembling
buds
these
young
afterwards
become
what
are
known
as
which
in
turn
reproduce
themselves
but
here
is
a
wonder
the
lay
eggs
which
when
hatched
produce
stationary
polyps
like
their
grandparent
and
not
moving
creatures
like
their
parents
the
have
a
comparatively
complex
organism
they
have
an
intricate
system
of
passages
with
which
to
convey
their
food
and
oxygen
to
the
various
parts
they
also
have
something
like
muscles
which
contract
and
enable
the
creature
to
swim
they
also
possess
a
nervous
system
and
most
wonderful
of
all
they
have
eyes
and
their
tentacles
like
those
of
the
secrete
the
poisonous
fluid
which
is
discharged
into
prey
or
enemy
akin
to
the
polyps
are
the
with
their
beautiful
colors
and
still
more
complex
structure
and
organism
the
tentacles
of
which
resemble
the
petals
of
a
flower
varying
slightly
from
these
are
the
which
form
in
colonies
and
the
skeletons
of
which
form
the
coral
trees
and
branches
and
other
forms
with
which
we
are
familiar
passing
on
to
the
next
highest
family
of
we
see
the
such
as
the
which
possess
a
thick
hard
skin
covered
by
spines
or
prickly
projections
these
creatures
abound
in
numerous
species
the
has
rays
projecting
from
a
common
centre
which
gives
it
its
name
while
the
resembles
a
ball
the
with
their
stems
and
flowers
belong
to
this
family
as
do
also
the
whose
name
is
obtained
from
their
shape
and
general
appearance
but
which
are
animals
possessing
a
comparatively
complex
organism
one
of
the
features
of
which
is
a
stomach
which
may
be
discarded
at
will
and
replaced
by
a
new
one
these
creatures
have
a
well
defined
nervous
system
and
have
eyes
and
some
of
them
even
rudimentary
eyelids
ascending
the
scale
of
we
next
observe
the
great
family
of
the
or
jointed
creatures
which
comprises
the
various
families
of
the
worm
the
crab
the
spider
the
ant
etc
in
this
great
family
are
grouped
nearly

consisting
of
two
thin
threads
knotted
at
different
points
into
ganglia
or
masses
of
nerve
cells
similar
to
those
possessed
by
the
higher
animals
they
possess

and
other
sense
organs
in
some
cases

possess
organs
corresponding
to
the

distributed
by
a
fluid
resembling
blood
which
carries

nourishment
to

is
distributed
by
each
of
these
forms
in
a
corresponding
way
the
higher
forms
having
rudimentary
lungs
and
respiratory
organs
step
by
step
the
are
perfected
and
the
organs
necessary
to
perform
certain
definite
functions
are
evolved
from
rudimentary
to
perfected
forms
the
families
of
worms
are
the
humblest
members
of
the
great
family
of
the
annulosa
next
come
the
creatures
called
rotifers
which
are
very
minute
then
come
the
crustacea
so
called
from
their
crustlike
shell
this
group
includes
the
crabs
lobsters
and
closely
resembles
the
insects
in
fact
some
of
the
best
authorities
believe
that
the
insects
and
the
crustacea
spring
from
the
same
parent
form
and
some
of
the
yogi
authorities
hold
to
this
belief
while
others
do
not
attempt
to
pass
upon
it
deeming
it
immaterial
inasmuch
as
all
have
a
common
origin
the
western
scientists
pay
great
attention
to
outward
details
while
the
oriental
mind
is
apt
to
pass
over
these
details
as
of
slight
importance
preferring
to
seek
the
cause
back
of
the
outward
form
on
one
point
both
the
yogi
teachers
and
the
scientists
absolutely
agree
and
that
is
that
the
family
of
insect
life
had
its
origin
in
some
aquatic
creature
both
hold
that
the
wings
of
the
insect
have
been
evolved
from
organs
primarily
used
for
breathing
purposes
by
the
ancestor
when
it
took
short
aerial
flights
the
need
for
means
of
flight
afterwards
acting
to
develop
these
rudimentary
organs
into
perfected
wings
there
need
be
no
more
wonder
expressed
at
this
change
than
in
the
case
of
the
transformation
of
the
insect
from
grub
to
chrysalis
and
then
to
insect
in
fact
this
process
is
a
reproduction
of
the
stages
through
which
the
passed
during
the
long
ages
between
and
we
need
not
take
up
much
of
your
time
in
speaking
of
the
wonderful
complex
organism
of
some
of
the
insect
family
which
are
next
on
the
scale
above
the
crustacea
the
wonders
of
the
almost
human
life
of
the
ants
the
spirit
of
the
beehive
and
all
the
rest
of
the
wonders
of
insect
life
are
familiar
to
all
of
our
readers
a
study
of
some
good
book
on
the
life
of
the
higher
forms
of
the
insect
family
will
prove
of
value
to
anyone
for
it
will
open
his
or
her
eyes
to
the
wonderful
manifestation
of
life
and
mind
among
these
creatures
remember
the
remark
of
darwin
that
the
brain
of
the
ant
although
not
much
larger
than
a
pin
point
is
one
of
the
most
marvelous
atoms
of
matter
in
the
world
perhaps
more
so
than
the
brain
of
man
closely
allied
to
the
crustacea
is
the
of
the
which
includes
the
oyster
clams
and
similar
creatures
also
the
snails
slugs
nautilus
etc
some
are
protected
by
a
hard
shell
while
others
have
a
gristly
outer
skin
serving
as
an
armor
while
others
still
are
naked
those
having
shells
secrete
the
material
for
their
construction
from
the
water
some
of
them
are
fixed
to
rocks
while
others
roam
at
will
strange
as
it
may
appear
at
first
sight
some
of
the
higher
forms
of
the
mollusca
show
signs
of
a
rudimentary
vertebra
and
science
has
hazarded
the
opinion
that
the
and
similar
creatures
were
descended
from
some
ancestor
from
whom
also
descended
the
vertebrate
animals
of
which
man
is
the
highest
form
known
today
on
this
planet
we
shall
mention
this
connection
in
our
next
lesson
where
we
will
take
up
the
story
of
the
ascent
of
man
from
the
lowly
vertebrate
forms
and
now
in
closing
this
lesson
we
must
remind
the
reader
that
we
are
teaching
evolution
as
it
is
conceived
by
modern
science
we
are
viewing
it
from
the
opposite
viewpoint
of
the
yogi
teaching
modern
science
teaches
that
mind
is
a
of
the
evolving
material
forms
while
the
yogi
teachings
hold
that
there
was
mind
in
the
lowest
form
and
that
that
mind
constantly
pressing
forward
for
unfoldment
the
gradual
evolution
or
unfoldment
of
the
slowly
advancing
degrees
of
organization
and
function
science
teaches
that
function
precedes
organization
that
is
that
a
form
performs
certain
functions
imperfectly
and
crudely
before
it
evolves
the
organs
suitable
for
the
functioning
for
instance
the
lower
forms
digested
food
before
they
evolved
stomachs
the
latter
coming
to
meet
the
need
but
the
yogi
teachings
go
further
and
claim
that
desire
precedes
function
that
is
that
the
lowly
life
form
desires
to
have
digestive
apparatus
in
order
to
proceed
in
the
evolutionary
scale
before
it
begins
the
functioning
that
brings
about
the
more
complex
organism
there
is
ever
the
urge
of
the
mind
which
craves
unfoldment
and
which
the
creature
feels
as
a
dim
desire
which
grows
stronger
and
stronger
as
time
goes
on
some
yield
more
readily
to
the
urge
and
such
become
the
parents
of
possible
higher
forms
many
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
and
so
matters
move
along
slowly
from
generation
to
generation
a
few
forms
serving
to
carry
on
the
evolutionary
urge
to
their
descendants
but
is
always
the
evolutionary
urge
of
the
imprisoned
mind
striving
to
cast
aside
its
sheaths
and
to
have
more
perfect
machinery
with
which
and
through
which
to
manifest
and
express
itself
this
is
the
difference
between
the
evolution
of
modern
science
and
the
unfoldment
of
the
yogi
teachings
the
one
is
all
material
with
mind
as
a
mere
while
the
other
is
all
mind
with
matter
as
a
tool
and
instrument
of
expression
and
manifestation
as
we
have
said
in
this
lesson
and
as
we
shall
point
out
to
you
in
detail
in
future
lessons
accompanying
this
evolution
of
bodies
there
is
an
evolution
of
souls
producing
the
former
this
evolution
of
souls
is
a
basic
principle
of
the
yogi
teachings
but
it
is
first
necessary
that
you
acquaint
yourselves
with
the
evolution
of
bodies
and
forms
before
you
may
fully
grasp
the
higher
teachings
our
next
lesson
will
be
entitled
the
ascent
of
man
in
which
the
rise
of
man
that
is
his
body
from
the
lowly
forms
of
the
vertebrates
is
shown
in
the
same
lesson
we
shall
begin
our
consideration
of
the
evolution
of
souls
we
trust
that
the
students
are
carefully
studying
the
details
of
each
lesson
for
every
lesson
has
its
part
in
the
grand
whole
of
the
teachings
the
eighth
lesson
the
ascent
of
man
in
our
last
lesson
we
led
you
by
successive
steps
from
the
beginnings
of
life
in
living
forms
up
to
the
creatures
closely
resembling
the
family
of
vertebrates
the
highest
family
of
living
forms
on
this
planet
in
this
present
lesson
we
take
up
the
story
of
the
ascent
of
man
from
the
lowly
vertebrate
forms
the
large
of
forms
called
the
vertebrates
are
distinguished
from
the
invertebrates
by
reason
of
the
former
possessing
an
bony
skeleton
the
most
important
feature
of
which
is
the
vertebra
or
spinal
column
the
vertebrates
be
it
remembered
possess
practically
the
same
organs
as
the
lower
forms
of
life
but
differ
from
them
most
materially
by
the
possession
of
the
skeleton
the
lower
forms
having
an
or
outside
which
latter
is
merely
a
hardening
of
the
skin
the
flexibility
of
the
vertebra
creates
a
wonderful
strength
of
structure
combined
with
an
ease
of
movement
peculiar
to
the
vertebrates
and
which
renders
them
the
natural
forms
of
life
capable
of
rapid
development
and
evolution
by
means
of
this
strength
and
ease
these
forms
are
enabled
to
move
rapidly
in
pursuit
of
their
prey
and
away
from
their
pursuers
and
also
to
resist
outside
pressure
or
attack
they
are
protected
in
a
way
similar
to
the
invertebrates
having
shells
and
yet
have
the
additional
advantage
of
easy
movement
differing
in
shape
and
appearance
as
do
the
numerous
members
of
the
of
vertebrates
still
their
structure
is
easily
seen
to
spring
from
a
single
form
all
are
modifications
of
some
common
pattern
the
differences
arising
from
the
necessities
of
the
life
of
the
animal
as
manifested
through
the
desire
and
necessities
of
the
species
science
shows
the
direct
relationship
between
the
vertebrates
and
the
invertebrates
by
means
of
several
the
most
noticeable
of
which
is
the
lancelot
a
creature
resembling
the
and
yet
also
closely
resembling
the
lower
invertebrate
forms
of
life
this
creature
has
no
head
and
but
one
eye
it
is
and
possesses
for
forcing
in
the
water
containing
its
food
it
has
something
like
gills
and
a
gullet
like
the
lower
forms
it
has
no
heart
the
blood
being
circulated
by
means
of
contracting
vessels
or
parts
strictly
speaking
it
has
no
or
vertebra
but
still
science
has
been
compelled
to
class
it
among
the
vertebrates
because
is
has
a
gristly
cartilage
where
the
is
found
in
the
higher
forms
this
gristle
may
be
called
an
elementary
spine
it
has
a
nervous
system
consisting
of
a
single
cord
which
spreads
into
a
broadened
end
near
the
creature
mouth
and
which
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
something
like
a
brain
this
creature
is
really
a
developed
form
of
invertebrate
shaped
like
a
vertebrate
and
showing
signs
of
a
rudimentary
spine
and
nervous
system
of
the
latter
it
is
a
the
lowest
forms
of
the
true
vertebrates
are
the
great
families
of
fishes
these
fish
families
include
fishes
of
high
and
low
degree
some
of
the
higher
forms
being
as
different
from
the
lowest
as
they
the
highest
are
different
from
the
reptile
family
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
into
detail
regarding
the
nature
of
the
fish
families
for
every
student
is
more
or
less
familiar
with
them
some
peculiar
forms
of
fish
show
a
shading
into
the
reptile
family
in
fact
they
seem
to
belong
nearly
as
much
to
the
latter
as
to
their
own
general
family
some
species
of
fish
known
as
the
or
have
a
remarkable
dual
system
of
breathing
that
is
they
have
gills
for
breathing
while
in
the
water
and
also
have
a
primitive
or
elementary
lung
in
the
shape
of
an
or
sound
which
they
use
for
breathing
on
land
the
of
south
america
and
also
other
forms
in
australia
and
other
places
have
a
modification
of
fins
which
are
practically
limbs
which
they
actually
use
for
traveling
on
land
from
pond
to
pond
some
of
these
fish
have
been
known
to
travel
enormous
distances
in
search
of
new
pools
of
water
or
new
streams
having
been
driven
from
their
original
homes
by
droughts
or
perhaps
by
instincts
similar
to
the
migrating
instinct
of
birds
eels
are
although
many
commonly
forget
this
fact
and
many
of
their
species
are
able
to
leave
the
water
and
travel
on
land
from
pond
to
pond
their
breathing
being
performed
by
a
peculiar
modification
of
the
gills
the
climbing
perch
of
india
are
able
to
live
out
of
water
and
have
modified
gills
for
breathing
purposes
and
modified
fins
for
climbing
and
walking
so
you
see
that
without
leaving
the
fish
family
proper
we
have
examples
of
land
living
creatures
which
are
akin
to
connecting
links
but
there
are
real
between
the
fish
and
the
reptiles
passing
over
the
many
queer
forms
which
serve
as
links
between
the
two
families
we
have
but
to
consider
our
common
history
for
a
striking
example
the
tadpole
has
gills
has
no
limbs
uses
its
tail
like
a
fish
fin
eats
plants
etc
passing
through
several
interesting
stages
the
tadpole
reaches
a
stage
in
which
it
is
a
frog
with
a
tail
then
it
sheds
its
tail
and
is
a
full
fledged
frog
with
four
legs
no
tail
and
feeding
on
animals
the
frog
is
amphibious
that
is
able
to
live
on
land
or
in
water
and
yet
it
is
compelled
to
come
to
the
surface
of
the
water
for
air
to
supply
its
lungs
some
of
the
amphibious
animals
possess
both
lungs
and
gills
even
when
matured
but
the
higher
vertebrates
living
in
the
water
breathe
through
lungs
which
are
evolved
from
the
of
fishes
which
in
turn
have
been
evolved
from
the
primitive
gullet
of
the
lower
forms
there
are
fishes
known
which
are
students
will
kindly
remember
that
the
whale
is
not
a
fish
but
an
aquatic
animal
a
mammal
in
fact
bringing
forth
its
young
alive
and
suckling
it
from
its
breasts
so
we
readily
see
that
it
is
but
a
step
and
a
short
step
at
that
between
the
and
climbing
fishes
and
the
lower
forms
of
reptiles
the
frog
shows
us
the
process
of
evolution
between
the
two
families
its
life
history
reproducing
the
gradual
evolution
which
may
have
required
ages
to
perfect
in
the
case
of
the
species
you
will
remember
that
the
embryo
stages
of
all
creatures
reproduce
the
various
stages
of
evolution
through
which
the
species
has
passed
this
is
true
in
man
as
well
as
in
the
frog
we
need
not
tarry
long
in
considering
the
reptile
family
of
living
forms
in
its
varieties
of
serpents
lizards
crocodiles
turtles
we
have
studied
and
observed
its
forms
we
see
the
limbless
snakes
the
lizards
with
active
limbs
the
huge
clumsy
slow
crocodiles
and
alligators
the
turtles
and
tortoises
all
belonging
to
the
one
great
family
of
reptiles
and
nearly
all
of
them
being
degenerate
descendants
of
the
mighty
reptile
forms
of
the
geological
age
of
reptiles
in
which
flourished
the
mighty
forms
of
the
giant
reptiles
the
monsters
of
land
and
water
amidst
the
dense
vegetation
of
that
age
surrounded
by
the
most
favorable
conditions
these
mighty
creatures
flourished
and
lived
their
fossilized
skeleton
forms
evidencing
to
us
how
far
their
descendants
have
fallen
owing
to
less
favorable
conditions
and
the
development
of
other
more
in
harmony
with
their
changed
environment
next
comes
the
great
family
of
birds
the
birds
ascended
from
the
reptiles
this
is
the
eastern
teaching
and
this
is
the
teaching
of
western
science
it
was
formerly
taught
in
the
that
the
line
of
ascent
was
along
the
family
of
winged
reptiles
which
existed
in
the
age
of
reptiles
in
the
early
days
of
the
earth
but
the
later
writers
on
the
subject
in
the
western
world
have
contradicted
this
it
is
now
taught
that
these
ancient
were
featherless
and
more
closely
resembled
the
bat
family
than
birds
you
will
remember
that
a
bat
is
neither
a
reptile
nor
a
bird
it
is
a
mammal
bringing
forth
its
young
alive
and
suckling
them
at
its
breast
the
bat
is
more
like
a
mouse
and
its
wings
are
simply
membrane
stretched
between
its
fingers
its
feet
and
its
tail
the
line
of
ascent
from
reptile
to
bird
was
along
the
forms
of
the
reptiles
that
walked
on
land
there
are
close
anatomical
and
physiological
relations
and
correspondences
between
the
two
families
reptiles
and
birds
which
we
need
not
refer
to
here
and
of
course
many
modifications
have
occurred
since
the
the
scales
of
the
reptiles
and
the
feathers
of
the
birds
are
known
to
be
but
modifications
of
the
original
outer
skin
as
are
also
the
hair
claws
hoofs
nails
of
all
animals
even
teeth
arose
in
this
way
strange
as
it
may
now
seem
they
are
all
secreted
from
the
skin
what
a
wonderful
field
for
thought
this
gradual
evolution
from
the
filmy
outer
covering
of
the
lowest
living
forms
to
the
beautiful
feathers
beaks
and
claws
of
the
bird
the
evolving
of
wings
meant
much
to
the
ascending
forms
of
life
the
reptiles
were
compelled
to
live
in
a
narrow
circle
of
territory
while
the
birds
were
able
to
travel
over
the
earth
in
wide
flights
and
travel
always
develops
the
faculties
of
observation
memory
and
cultivates
the
senses
of
seeing
hearing
etc
and
the
creature
is
compelled
to
exercise
its
evolving
thinking
faculties
to
a
greater
extent
and
so
the
birds
were
compelled
by
necessity
of
their
travels
to
develop
a
greater
degree
of
thinking
organism
the
result
is
that
among
birds
we
find
many
instances
of
intelligent
thought
which
can
not
be
dismissed
as
mere
instinct
naturalists
place
the
crow
at
the
head
of
the
family
of
birds
in
point
of
intelligence
and
those
who
have
watched
these
creatures
and
studied
the
mental
processes
will
agree
that
this
is
a
just
decision
it
has
been
proven
that
crows
are
capable
of
counting
up
to
several
figures
and
in
other
ways
they
display
a
wonderful
degree
of
almost
human
sagacity
next
above
the
bird
family
comes
the
highest
form
of
all
the
mammals
but
before
we
begin
our
consideration
of
these
high
forms
let
us
take
a
hasty
glance
at
the
between
the
birds
and
the
mammals
the
lowest
forms
of
the
mammals
resemble
birds
in
many
ways
some
of
them
are
toothless
and
many
of
them
have
the
same
primitive
intestinal
arrangements
possessed
by
the
birds
from
which
arises
their
name
these
may
be
called
and
one
of
the
most
characteristic
of
their
family
is
the
or
which
the
early
naturalists
first
thought
was
a
fraud
of
the
taxidermists
or
and
then
when
finally
convinced
deemed
it
a
but
it
is
not
a
freak
creature
but
a
between
the
two
great
families
of
creatures
this
animal
presents
a
startling
appearance
to
the
observer
who
witnesses
it
for
the
first
time
it
resembles
a
beaver
having
a
soft
furry
coat
but
also
has
a
horny
flat
bill
like
a
duck
its
feet
being
webbed
but
also
furnished
with
claws
projecting
over
the
edge
of
the
it
lays
eggs
in
an
underground
nest
two
eggs
at
a
time
which
are
like
the
eggs
of
birds
inasmuch
as
they
contain
not
only
the
protoplasm
from
which
the
embryo
is
formed
but
also
the
yolk
on
which
the
embryo
feeds
until
hatched
after
the
young
is
hatched
it
feeds
from
teatless
glands
in
the
body
the
milk
being
furnished
by
the
mother
by
a
peculiar
process
consider
this
animal
which
lays
eggs
and
then
when
her
young
are
hatched
nourishes
them
with
the
in
the
mother
are
elementary
breasts
the
animal
is
found
in
australia
the
land
of
many
strange
forms
and
which
have
survived
there
while
in
other
parts
of
the
globe
they
have
vanished
gradually
from
existence
crowded
out
by
the
more
perfectly
evolved
forms
darwin
has
called
these
surviving
forms
living
fossils
in
that
same
land
is
also
found
the
or
spiny
which
lays
an
egg
and
then
hatches
it
in
her
pouch
after
which
she
nourishes
it
on
milk
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
of
the
this
animal
like
the
is
a
monotreme
scientists
are
divided
in
theories
as
to
whether
the
monotremes
are
actually
descended
directly
from
the
reptiles
or
birds
or
whether
there
was
a
common
ancestor
from
which
reptiles
and
birds
and
mammals
branched
off
but
this
is
not
important
for
the
relationship
between
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
is
clearly
proven
and
the
monotremes
are
certainly
one
of
the
surviving
forms
of
the
intermediate
stages
the
next
higher
step
in
the
ascent
of
mammal
life
above
the
monotreme
is
occupied
by
the
marsupials
or
pouched
of
which
family
the
opossum
and
kangaroo
are
well
known
members
the
characteristic
feature
of
this
family
of
creatures
is
the
possession
of
an
external
pouch
in
the
female
in
which
the
young
are
kept
and
nourished
until
they
can
take
care
of
themselves
as
the
young
of
other
animals
are
able
to
do
the
young
of
the
marsupials
are
brought
forth
or
born
in
an
imperfect
condition
and
undeveloped
in
size
and
strength
there
are
fossil
remains
of
marsupials
showing
that
in
past
ages
creatures
of
this
kind
existed
which
were
as
large
as
elephants
in
the
more
common
form
of
mammals
the
young
are
brought
forth
fully
formed
they
having
received
nourishment
before
birth
from
the
mother
body
through
the
the
appendage
which
connects
the
fetus
with
the
parent
the
placental
mammals
were
the
best
equipped
of
all
the
for
survival
and
development
for
the
reason
that
the
young
were
nourished
during
their
critical
period
and
the
care
that
the
mammal
must
of
necessity
give
to
her
young
operated
in
the
direction
of
affording
a
special
protection
far
superior
to
that
of
the
other
forms
this
and
other
causes
acted
to
place
the
placentals
in
the
royal
line
from
which
man
was
evolved
the
following
families
of
placental
mammals
are
recognized
by
science
each
having
its
own
structural
peculiarities
the
or
toothless
creatures
among
which
are
the
sloths
armadillos
etc
these
animals
seem
to
be
closer
to
the
monotremes
than
they
are
to
the
marsupials
the
so
called
by
reason
of
their
fanciful
resemblance
to
the
sirens
of
mythology
among
which
are
the
manatees
dugongs
which
are
in
structure
and
appearance
the
being
shaped
like
paddles
or
fins
and
the
being
absent
or
rudimentary
the
or
whale
family
including
whales
porpoises
dolphins
which
are
quite
in
appearance
and
structure
their
forms
being
adapted
for
life
in
the
sea
although
they
are
of
course
mammals
bringing
forth
matured
young
which
are
suckled
at
the
breast
the
or
hoofed
animals
which
comprise
many
varied
forms
such
as
the
horse
the
tapir
the
rhinoceros
the
swine
the
hippopotamus
the
camel
the
deer
the
sheep
the
cow
etc
the
which
is
a
small
family
the
principal
member
of
which
is
the
coney
or
rock
rabbit
which
has
teeth
resembling
those
of
the
hoofed
animals
in
some
ways
and
those
of
the
gnawing
animals
in
the
others
the
or
trunked
animals
which
family
is
represented
in
this
age
only
by
the
families
of
elephants
which
have
a
peculiar
appendage
called
a
trunk
which
they
use
as
an
additional
limb
the
or
represented
by
numerous
and
various
forms
such
as
the
seal
the
bear
the
weasel
the
wolf
the
dog
the
lion
the
tiger
the
leopard
etc
the
wolf
and
similar
forms
belong
to
the
of
dogs
while
the
lion
tiger
belong
to
the
of
cats
the
or
gnawers
comprising
the
rat
the
hare
the
beaver
the
squirrel
the
mouse
etc
the
or
insect
feeders
comprising
the
mole
the
shrew
the
hedgehog
etc
the
or
animals
comprising
the
great
family
of
bats
which
are
very
highly
developed
animals
the
or
lemurs
the
name
of
which
is
derived
from
the
latin
word
meaning
a
ghost
by
reason
of
the
lemur
habits
of
roaming
about
at
night
the
lemur
is
a
nocturnal
animal
somewhat
resembling
the
monkey
in
general
appearance
but
with
a
long
bushy
tail
and
sharp
muzzle
like
a
fox
it
is
akin
to
a
small
fox
having
hands
and
feet
like
a
monkey
the
feet
being
used
to
grasp
like
a
hand
as
is
the
case
with
the
true
monkey
family
these
creatures
are
classed
by
some
naturalists
among
the
monkeys
by
reason
of
being
while
others
are
disposed
to
consider
as
still
more
important
their
marked
relationship
with
and
affinity
to
the
marsupials
gnawers
and
on
the
whole
these
creatures
are
strangely
organized
and
come
very
near
to
being
a
between
other
forms
one
of
the
lemurs
is
what
is
known
as
the
or
flying
lemur
which
resembles
a
squirrel
in
many
particulars
and
yet
has
a
membranous
web
extending
from
its
hands
which
enables
it
to
make
flying
leaps
over
great
distances
this
last
named
variety
seems
to
furnish
a
link
between
the
and
the
primates
the
which
is
a
large
family
comprising
the
various
forms
of
monkeys
baboons
such
as
the
gibbon
gorilla
chimpanzee
all
of
which
have
big
jaws
small
brains
and
a
stooping
posture
this
family
also
includes
man
with
his
big
brain
and
erect
posture
and
his
many
races
depending
upon
shape
of
skull
color
of
skin
character
of
hair
etc
in
considering
the
ascent
of
man
physical
from
the
lowly
forms
of
the
monera
up
to
his
present
high
position
the
student
is
struck
with
the
continuity
of
the
ascent
development
and
unfoldment
while
there
are
many
owing
to
the
disappearance
of
the
forms
which
formed
the
connection
still
there
is
sufficient
proof
left
in
the
existing
forms
to
satisfy
the
inquirer
the
facts
of
embryology
alone
are
sufficient
proof
of
the
ascent
of
man
from
the
lowly
forms
each
and
every
man
today
has
passed
through
all
the
forms
of
the
ascent
within
a
few
months
from
single
cell
to
the
fully
formed
infant
embryology
teaches
us
that
the
eggs
from
which
all
animal
forms
evolve
are
all
practically
alike
so
far
as
one
can
ascertain
by
microscopic
examination
no
matter
how
diverse
may
be
the
forms
which
will
evolve
from
them
and
this
resemblance
is
maintained
even
when
the
embryo
of
the
higher
forms
begins
to
manifest
traces
of
its
future
form
von
baer
the
german
scientist
was
the
first
to
note
this
remarkable
and
suggestive
fact
he
stated
it
in
the
following
words
in
my
possession
are
two
little
embryos
preserved
in
alcohol
whose
names
i
have
omitted
to
attach
and
at
present
i
am
unable
to
state
to
what
class
they
belong
they
may
be
lizards
or
small
birds
or
very
young
mammals
so
complete
is
the
similarity
in
the
mode
of
the
formation
of
the
head
and
trunk
in
these
animals
the
extremities
however
are
still
absent
in
these
embryos
but
even
if
they
had
existed
in
the
earliest
stage
of
their
development
we
should
learn
nothing
for
the
feet
of
lizards
and
mammals
the
wings
and
feet
of
birds
no
less
than
the
hands
and
feet
of
man
all
arise
from
the
same
fundamental
form
as
has
been
said
by
clodd
the
embryos
of
all
living
creatures
epitomize
during
development
the
series
of
changes
through
which
the
ancestral
forms
passed
if
their
ascent
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
the
higher
structures
passing
through
the
same
stages
as
the
lower
structures
up
to
the
point
when
they
are
marked
off
from
them
yet
never
becoming
in
detail
the
form
which
they
represent
for
the
time
being
for
example
the
embryo
of
man
has
at
the
outset
slits
on
each
side
of
the
neck
like
a
fish
these
give
place
to
a
membrane
like
that
which
supersedes
gills
in
the
development
of
birds
and
reptiles
the
heart
is
at
first
a
simple
pulsating
chamber
like
that
in
worms
the
backbone
is
prolonged
into
a
movable
tail
the
great
toe
is
extended
or
opposable
like
our
thumbs
and
like
the
toes
of
apes
the
body
three
months
before
birth
is
covered
all
over
with
hair
except
on
the
palms
and
soles
at
birth
the
head
is
relatively
larger
and
the
arms
and
legs
relatively
longer
than
in
the
adult
the
nose
is
bridgeless
both
features
with
others
which
need
not
be
detailed
being
distinctly
thus
does
the
egg
from
which
man
springs
a
structure
only
one
hundred
and
of
an
inch
in
size
compress
into
a
few
weeks
the
results
of
millions
of
years
and
set
before
us
the
history
of
his
development
from
and
reptilian
forms
and
of
his
more
immediate
descent
from
a
hairy
tailed
quadruped
that
which
is
individual
or
peculiar
to
him
the
physical
and
mental
character
inherited
is
left
to
the
slower
development
which
follows
birth
this
then
in
brief
is
the
western
theory
of
evolution
the
physical
ascent
of
man
we
have
given
it
as
fully
as
might
be
in
the
small
space
at
our
disposal
in
these
lessons
on
the
yogi
philosophy
why
because
we
wish
to
prove
to
the
western
mind
in
the
western
way
that
western
science
corroborates
the
ancient
yogi
teachings
of
the
unfoldment
of
living
forms
from
monad
to
man
the
eastern
teachers
scorn
to
prove
anything
to
their
pupils
who
sit
at
the
feet
of
teachers
and
accept
as
truth
that
which
is
taught
them
and
which
has
been
handed
down
from
the
dim
ages
long
past
but
this
method
will
never
do
for
the
western
student
he
must
have
it
proven
to
him
by
physical
facts
and
instances
not
by
keen
subtle
intellectual
reasoning
alone
the
eastern
student
wishes
to
be
told
the
western
student
wishes
to
be
shown
herein
lies
the
racial
differences
of
method
of
imparting
knowledge
and
so
we
have
recognized
this
fact
and
have
heaped
up
proof
after
proof
from
the
pages
of
western
science
in
order
to
prove
to
you
the
reasonableness
from
the
western
point
of
view
of
the
doctrine
of
physical
unfoldment
as
taught
for
ages
past
by
the
yogi
to
their
you
have
now
the
eastern
teachings
on
the
subject
together
with
the
testimony
of
western
science
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
idea
but
alas
western
science
while
performing
a
marvelous
work
in
piling
up
fact
after
fact
to
support
its
theory
of
evolution
in
a
way
utterly
unknown
to
the
oriental
thinker
who
seeks
after
principles
by
mental
concentration
rather
than
without
while
actually
proving
by
physical
facts
the
conceptions
of
the
oriental
teachings
still
misses
the
vital
point
of
the
in
its
materialistic
tendencies
it
has
failed
to
recognize
mental
cause
of
the
physical
it
is
true
that
lamark
the
real
western
discoverer
of
evolution
taught
that
desire
and
mental
craving
was
the
real
force
behind
evolution
but
his
ideas
were
jeered
at
by
his
contemporaries
and
are
not
regarded
seriously
by
the
majority
of
evolutionists
even
today
and
yet
he
was
nearer
to
the
truth
than
darwin
or
any
other
western
evolutionist
and
time
will
show
that
science
has
overlooked
his
genius
which
alone
throws
the
true
light
upon
the
subject
in
order
to
see
just
this
difference
between
the
darwinian
school
and
the
yogi
teachings
let
us
examine
into
what
causes
the
western
evolutionists
give
for
the
fact
of
evolution
itself
we
shall
do
this
briefly
the
darwinians
start
out
to
explain
the
causes
of
the
origin
of
species
with
the
statement
that
no
two
individuals
of
the
same
species
are
exactly
alike
each
tends
to
vary
this
is
a
fact
and
is
very
properly
used
as
a
starting
point
for
variation
the
next
step
is
then
stated
as
variations
are
transmitted
and
therefore
tend
to
become
permanent
which
also
is
and
tends
to
prove
the
reasonableness
of
the
gradual
evolution
of
species
the
next
step
in
the
argument
is
as
man
produces
new
species
and
forms
by
breeding
culture
so
has
nature
in
a
longer
time
produced
the
same
effect
in
the
same
way
this
also
is
reasonable
although
it
tends
to
personify
nature
and
to
give
it
a
before
the
evolutionists
admit
mind
was
evolved
it
will
be
as
well
to
quote
darwin
himself
on
this
point
he
says
as
man
can
produce
and
certainly
has
produced
a
great
result
by
his
methodical
and
unconscious
means
of
selection
what
may
not
natural
selection
effect
man
can
act
only
on
external
and
visible
characters
while
nature
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
personify
the
natural
preservation
or
survival
of
the
fittest
cares
nothing
for
appearances
except
in
so
far
as
they
are
useful
to
any
being
she
can
act
on
every
internal
organ
on
every
shade
of
constitutional
difference
on
the
whole
machinery
of
life
man
selects
only
for
his
own
good
nature
only
for
the
good
of
the
being
which
she
tends
every
selected
character
is
fully
exercised
by
her
as
is
implied
by
the
fact
of
their
selection
man
keeps
the
natives
of
many
climates
in
the
same
country
he
seldom
exercises
each
selected
character
in
some
peculiar
and
fitting
manner
he
feeds
a
and
a
pigeon
on
the
same
food
he
does
not
exercise
a
or
quadruped
in
any
peculiar
manner
he
exposes
sheep
with
long
hair
and
short
wool
in
the
same
climate
he
does
not
allow
the
most
vigorous
males
to
struggle
for
the
females
he
does
not
rigidly
destroy
all
inferior
animals
but
protects
during
each
varying
season
so
far
as
lies
in
his
power
all
his
productions
he
often
begins
his
selection
by
some
form
or
at
least
by
some
modification
prominent
enough
to
catch
the
eye
or
to
be
plainly
useful
to
him
under
nature
the
slightest
differences
of
structure
or
constitution
well
turn
the
nicely
balanced
scale
in
the
struggle
for
life
and
so
be
preserved
how
fleeting
are
the
wishes
and
efforts
of
man
how
short
his
time
and
consequently
how
poor
will
be
his
results
compared
with
those
accumulated
by
nature
during
whole
geological
periods
can
we
wonder
then
that
nature
productions
should
be
far
in
character
than
man
productions
that
they
should
be
infinitely
better
adapted
to
the
most
complex
conditions
of
life
and
should
plainly
bear
the
stamp
of
far
higher
workmanship
darwin
theory
of
survival
of
the
fittest
is
begun
by
the
statement
of
the
fact
that
the
number
of
organisms
that
survive
are
very
small
compared
with
the
number
that
are
born
to
quote
his
own
words
there
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
every
organic
being
naturally
increases
at
so
high
a
rate
that
if
not
destroyed
the
earth
would
soon
be
covered
by
the
progeny
of
a
single
pair
even
man
has
doubled
in
years
and
at
this
rate
in
less
than
a
thousand
years
there
would
literally
not
be
standing
room
for
the
progeny
it
has
been
computed
that
if
the
offspring
of
the
elephant
which
is
believed
to
be
the
slowest
breeding
animal
known
were
to
survive
there
would
be
about
elephants
on
the
earth
in
years
the
roe
of
a
single
cod
contains
eight
or
nine
millions
of
eggs
and
if
each
egg
were
to
hatch
and
the
fish
survive
the
sea
would
shortly
become
a
solid
mass
of
codfish
the
house
fly
is
said
to
have
descendants
in
a
season
counting
several
generations
of
progeny
from
its
several
broods
and
some
scientist
has
computed
that
the
or
breeds
so
rapidly
and
in
such
enormous
quantity
that
the
tenth
generation
of
one
set
of
parents
would
be
so
large
that
it
would
contain
more
ponderable
animal
matter
than
would
the
population
of
china
which
is
estimated
at
and
this
without
counting
the
progeny
preceding
the
tenth
generation
the
result
of
the
above
conditions
is
very
plain
there
must
ensue
a
struggle
for
existence
which
necessitates
the
survival
of
the
fittest
the
weak
are
crushed
out
by
the
strong
the
swift
the
slow
the
individual
forms
or
species
best
adapted
to
their
environment
and
best
equipped
for
the
struggle
be
the
equipment
physical
or
mental
survive
those
less
well
equipped
or
less
well
adapted
to
environment
animals
evolving
variations
in
structure
that
give
them
even
a
slight
advantage
over
others
not
so
favored
naturally
have
a
better
chance
to
survive
and
this
briefly
is
what
evolutionists
call
the
survival
of
the
fittest
as
appertaining
to
the
struggle
for
existence
color
and
mimicry
are
important
factors
grant
allen
in
his
work
on
darwin
says
concerning
this
and
also
as
illustrating
natural
selection
in
the
desert
with
its
monotonous
sandy
coloring
a
black
insect
or
a
white
insect
still
more
a
red
insect
or
a
blue
insect
would
be
immediately
detected
and
devoured
by
its
natural
enemies
the
birds
and
the
lizards
but
any
greyish
or
yellowish
insects
would
be
less
likely
to
attract
attention
at
first
sight
and
would
be
overlooked
as
long
as
there
were
any
more
conspicuous
individuals
of
their
own
kind
about
for
the
birds
and
lizards
to
feed
on
hence
in
a
very
short
time
the
desert
would
be
depopulated
of
all
but
the
greyest
and
yellowest
insects
and
among
these
the
birds
would
pick
out
those
which
differed
most
markedly
in
hue
and
shade
from
the
sand
around
them
but
those
which
happened
to
vary
most
in
the
direction
of
a
sandy
or
spotty
color
would
be
more
likely
to
survive
and
to
become
the
parents
of
future
generations
thus
in
the
course
of
long
ages
all
the
insects
which
inhabit
deserts
have
become
because
the
less
sandy
were
perpetually
picked
out
for
destruction
by
their
foes
while
the
most
sandy
escaped
and
multiplied
and
replenished
the
earth
with
their
own
likes
clodd
remarking
upon
this
fact
adds
thus
then
is
explained
the
tawny
color
of
the
larger
animals
that
inhabit
the
desert
the
stripes
upon
the
tiger
which
parallel
with
the
vertical
stems
of
bamboo
conceal
him
as
he
stealthily
nears
his
prey
the
brilliant
green
of
tropical
birds
the
form
and
colors
of
certain
insects
the
dried
form
of
many
caterpillars
the
appearance
of
the
harmony
of
the
ptarmigan
summer
plumage
with
the
stones
upon
which
it
sits
the
dusky
color
of
creatures
that
haunt
the
night
the
bluish
transparency
of
animals
which
live
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
color
of
that
live
at
the
bottom
and
the
gorgeous
tints
of
those
that
swim
among
the
coral
reefs
all
this
does
not
run
contrary
to
the
yogi
philosophy
although
the
latter
would
regard
these
things
as
but
the
secondary
cause
for
the
variation
and
survival
of
species
etc
the
oriental
teachings
are
that
it
is
the
of
the
animal
that
it
to
assume
the
colors
and
shapes
in
accordance
with
its
environment
the
desire
of
course
operating
along
lines
of
physical
manifestation
the
mental
influence
which
is
the
real
cause
of
the
phenomena
and
which
is
taught
as
such
by
the
yogis
is
almost
lost
sight
of
by
the
western
evolutionists
who
are
apt
to
regard
mind
as
a
of
matter
on
the
contrary
yogis
regard
matter
as
the
product
of
but
there
is
no
conflict
here
as
far
as
regards
the
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
the
insects
that
to
become
became
so
and
were
thus
protected
while
their
less
desireful
brethren
were
exterminated
the
western
scientist
explains
the
outward
phenomena
but
does
not
look
for
the
behind
it
which
is
taught
by
the
oriental
sages
the
doctrine
of
sexual
selection
is
another
of
the
leading
tenets
of
the
darwinists
briefly
it
may
be
expressed
as
the
theory
that
in
the
rivalry
and
struggle
of
the
males
for
the
females
the
strongest
males
win
the
day
and
thus
transmit
their
particular
qualities
to
their
offspring
along
the
same
lines
is
that
of
the
attraction
exerted
by
bright
colors
in
the
plumage
of
the
males
of
birds
which
give
them
an
advantage
in
the
eyes
of
the
females
and
thus
naturally
the
bright
colors
are
perpetuated
this
then
is
the
brief
outline
of
the
story
of
man
physical
evolution
as
stated
by
western
science
and
compared
with
the
yogi
teachings
the
student
should
compare
the
two
ideas
that
he
may
harmonize
and
reconcile
them
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
darwin
did
teach
that
man
descended
from
the
monkeys
or
apes
as
we
know
them
now
the
teaching
of
western
evolution
is
that
the
apes
and
higher
forms
of
monkey
life
descended
from
some
common
ancestral
form
which
same
ancestor
was
also
the
ancestor
of
man
in
other
words
man
and
apes
are
the
different
branches
that
emerged
from
the
common
trunk
ages
ago
other
forms
doubtless
emerged
from
the
same
trunk
and
perished
because
less
adapted
to
their
environments
the
apes
were
best
adapted
to
their
own
environments
and
man
was
best
adapted
to
his
the
weaker
branches
failed
one
must
remember
that
the
most
savage
races
known
to
us
today
are
practically
as
far
different
from
the
highest
american
european
or
hindu
types
of
man
as
from
the
highest
apes
indeed
it
would
seem
far
easier
for
a
high
ape
to
evolve
into
a
kaffir
hottentot
or
digger
indian
than
for
the
latter
to
evolve
into
an
emerson
shakespeare
or
hindu
sage
as
huxley
has
shown
the
of
man
compared
with
that
of
the
chimpanzee
shows
differences
but
slight
when
compared
with
the
difference
between
that
of
the
chimpanzee
and
that
of
the
lemur
the
same
authority
informs
us
that
in
the
important
feature
of
the
deeper
brain
furrows
and
intricate
convolutions
the
chasm
between
the
highest
civilized
man
and
the
lowest
savage
is
far
greater
than
between
the
lowest
savage
and
the
highest
ape
darwin
describing
the
fuegians
who
are
among
the
very
lowest
forms
of
savages
says
their
very
signs
and
expressions
are
less
intelligible
to
us
than
those
of
the
domesticated
animal
they
are
men
who
do
not
possess
the
instinct
of
those
animals
nor
yet
appear
to
boast
of
human
reason
or
at
least
of
arts
consequent
upon
that
reason
professor
clodd
in
describing
the
primitive
man
says
doubtless
he
was
lower
than
the
lowest
of
the
savages
of
today
a
powerful
cunning
biped
with
keen
sense
organs
always
sharper
in
virtue
of
constant
exercise
in
the
savage
than
in
the
civilized
man
who
supplements
them
by
science
strong
instincts
uncontrolled
and
fitful
emotions
small
faculty
of
wonder
and
nascent
reasoning
power
unable
to
forecast
tomorrow
or
to
comprehend
yesterday
living
from
hand
to
mouth
on
the
wild
products
of
nature
clothed
in
skin
and
bark
or
daubed
with
clay
and
finding
shelter
in
trees
and
caves
ignorant
of
the
simplest
arts
save
to
chip
a
stone
missile
and
perhaps
to
produce
fire
strong
in
his
needs
of
life
and
vague
sense
of
right
to
it
and
to
what
he
could
get
but
slowly
impelled
by
common
perils
and
passions
to
form
ties
loose
and
haphazard
at
the
outset
with
his
kind
the
power
of
combination
with
them
depending
on
sounds
signs
and
gestures
such
was
the
ancestral
man
those
who
are
interested
in
him
are
referred
to
the
two
wonderful
tales
of
the
written
in
the
form
of
stories
by
two
great
modern
novelists
the
books
referred
to
are
story
of
by
stanley
waterloo
and
by
jack
london
they
may
be
obtained
from
any
bookseller
both
are
works
of
fiction
with
the
scientific
facts
cleverly
interwoven
into
them
and
now
in
conclusion
before
we
pass
on
the
subject
of
spiritual
evolution
which
will
form
the
subject
of
our
next
lesson
we
would
again
call
your
attention
to
the
vital
difference
between
the
western
and
the
eastern
teachings
the
western
holds
to
a
mechanical
theory
of
life
which
works
without
the
necessity
of
antecedent
mind
the
latter
appearing
as
a
product
at
a
certain
stage
the
eastern
holds
mind
is
back
of
under
and
antecedent
to
all
the
work
of
the
not
the
effect
or
product
the
western
claims
that
mind
was
produced
by
the
struggle
of
matter
to
produce
higher
forms
of
itself
eastern
claims
that
the
whole
process
of
evolution
is
caused
by
mind
striving
struggling
and
pressing
forward
toward
expressing
itself
more
fully
to
liberate
itself
from
the
confining
and
retarding
matter
the
struggle
resulting
in
an
unfoldment
which
causes
sheath
after
sheath
of
the
confining
material
bonds
to
be
thrown
off
and
discarded
in
the
effort
to
release
the
confined
spirit
which
is
behind
even
the
mind
the
yogi
teachings
are
that
the
evolutionary
urge
is
the
pressure
of
the
confined
spirit
striving
to
free
itself
from
the
fetters
and
bonds
which
sorely
oppress
the
struggle
and
pain
of
evolution
is
the
of
the
spiritual
deliverance
from
the
womb
of
matter
like
all
birth
it
is
attended
by
pain
and
suffering
but
the
end
justifies
it
all
and
as
the
human
mother
forgets
her
past
suffering
in
the
joy
of
witnessing
the
face
and
form
and
life
of
her
loved
child
so
will
the
soul
forget
the
pain
of
the
spiritual
birth
by
reason
of
the
beauty
and
nobility
of
that
which
will
be
born
to
and
from
it
let
us
study
well
the
story
of
physical
evolution
but
let
us
not
lose
ourselves
in
it
for
it
is
but
the
preliminary
to
the
story
of
the
unfoldment
of
the
soul
let
us
not
despise
the
tale
of
the
body
of
man
for
it
is
the
story
of
the
temple
of
the
spirit
which
has
been
built
up
from
the
most
humble
beginnings
until
it
has
reached
the
present
high
stage
and
yet
even
this
is
but
the
beginning
for
the
work
will
go
on
and
on
and
on
in
the
spirit
of
those
beautiful
lines
of
holmes
build
thee
more
stately
mansions
oh
my
soul
as
the
swift
seasons
roll
leave
thy
past
let
each
new
temple
nobler
than
the
last
shut
thee
from
heaven
with
a
dome
more
vast
till
thou
at
last
leaving
thine
outgrown
shell
by
life
unresting
sea
the
ninth
lesson
metempsychosis
as
we
have
said
in
our
last
lesson
while
the
yogi
teachings
throw
an
important
light
upon
the
western
theory
of
evolution
still
there
is
a
vital
difference
between
the
western
scientific
teachings
on
the
subject
and
the
eastern
theories
and
teachings
the
western
idea
is
that
the
process
is
a
mechanical
material
one
and
that
mind
is
a
of
matter
in
its
evolution
but
the
eastern
teachings
hold
that
mind
is
under
back
of
and
antecedent
to
all
the
work
of
evolution
and
that
matter
is
a
of
mind
rather
than
the
reverse
the
eastern
teachings
hold
that
evolution
is
caused
by
mind
striving
struggling
and
pressing
forward
toward
fuller
and
fuller
expression
using
matter
as
a
material
and
yet
always
struggling
to
free
itself
from
the
confining
and
retarding
influence
of
the
latter
the
struggle
results
in
an
unfoldment
causing
sheath
after
sheath
of
the
confining
material
bonds
to
be
thrown
off
and
discarded
as
the
spirit
presses
upon
the
mind
and
the
mind
moulds
and
shapes
the
matter
evolution
is
but
the
process
of
birth
of
the
individualized
spirit
from
the
web
of
matter
in
which
it
has
been
confined
and
the
pains
and
struggles
are
but
incidents
of
the
spiritual
parturition
in
this
and
following
lessons
we
shall
consider
the
spiritual
evolution
of
the
race
that
is
the
unfoldment
of
individualized
spirit
just
as
we
did
the
subject
physical
evolution
in
the
last
two
lessons
we
have
seen
that
preceding
spiritual
evolution
there
was
a
spiritual
involution
the
yogi
philosophy
holds
that
in
the
beginning
the
absolute
meditated
upon
the
subject
of
creation
and
formed
a
mental
image
or
of
an
universal
mind
that
is
of
an
universal
principle
of
mind
this
universal
principle
of
mind
is
the
great
ocean
of
from
which
all
the
phenomenal
universe
is
evolved
from
this
universal
principle
of
mind
proceeded
the
universal
principle
of
force
or
energy
and
from
the
latter
proceeded
the
universal
principle
of
matter
the
universal
principle
of
mind
was
bound
by
laws
imposed
upon
it
by
the
of
the
absolute
the
cosmic
laws
of
nature
and
these
laws
were
the
compelling
causes
of
the
great
involution
for
before
evolution
was
possible
involution
was
necessary
we
have
explained
that
the
word
involve
means
to
wrap
up
to
cover
to
hide
etc
before
a
thing
can
be
evolved
that
is
unfolded
it
must
first
be
involved
that
is
wrapped
up
a
thing
must
be
before
it
may
be
following
the
laws
of
involution
imposed
upon
it
the
universal
mental
principle
involved
itself
in
the
universal
energy
principle
and
then
in
obedience
to
the
same
laws
the
latter
involved
itself
in
the
universal
material
principle
each
stage
of
involution
or
created
for
itself
out
of
the
higher
principle
which
in
being
involved
the
wrapper
or
sheath
which
is
to
be
used
to
the
higher
principle
and
the
higher
forms
of
the
material
principle
formed
sheaths
of
lower
forms
until
forms
of
matter
were
produced
far
more
gross
than
any
known
to
us
now
for
they
have
disappeared
in
the
evolutionary
ascent
down
down
down
went
the
process
of
involution
until
the
lowest
point
was
reached
then
ensued
a
moment
pause
preceding
the
beginning
of
the
evolutionary
unfoldment
then
began
the
great
evolution
but
as
we
have
told
you
the
upward
movement
was
distinguished
by
the
tendency
toward
individualization
that
is
while
the
involuntary
process
was
accomplished
by
principles
as
principles
the
upward
movement
was
begun
by
a
tendency
toward
splitting
up
and
the
creation
of
individual
forms
and
the
effort
to
perfect
them
and
build
upon
them
higher
and
still
higher
succeeding
forms
until
a
stage
was
reached
in
which
the
temple
of
the
spirit
was
worthy
of
being
occupied
by
man
the
expression
of
the
spirit
for
the
coming
of
man
was
the
first
step
of
a
higher
form
of
evolution
the
spiritual
evolution
up
to
this
time
there
had
been
simply
an
evolution
of
bodies
but
now
there
came
the
evolution
of
souls
and
this
evolution
of
souls
becomes
possible
only
by
the
process
of
metempsychosis
pronounced
which
is
more
commonly
known
as
reincarnation
or
it
becomes
necessary
at
this
point
to
call
your
attention
to
the
general
subject
of
metempsychosis
for
the
reason
that
the
public
mind
is
most
confused
regarding
this
important
subject
it
has
the
most
vague
ideas
regarding
the
true
teachings
and
has
somehow
acquired
the
impression
that
the
teachings
are
that
human
souls
are
into
the
bodies
of
dogs
and
other
animals
the
wildest
ideas
on
this
subject
are
held
by
some
people
and
not
only
is
this
so
but
even
a
number
of
those
who
hold
to
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
in
some
of
its
forms
hold
that
their
individual
souls
were
once
the
individual
souls
of
animals
from
which
state
they
have
evolved
to
the
present
condition
this
last
is
a
perversion
of
the
highest
yogi
teachings
and
we
trust
to
make
same
plain
in
these
lessons
but
first
we
must
take
a
look
at
the
general
subject
of
metempsychosis
that
we
may
see
the
important
part
it
has
played
in
the
field
of
human
thought
and
belief
while
to
many
the
idea
of
metempsychosis
may
seem
new
and
unfamiliar
still
it
is
one
of
the
oldest
conceptions
of
the
race
and
in
ages
past
was
the
accepted
belief
of
the
whole
of
the
civilized
race
of
man
of
the
period
and
even
today
it
is
accepted
as
truth
by
the
majority
of
the
race
the
almost
universal
acceptance
of
the
idea
by
the
east
with
its
teeming
life
counterbalances
its
comparative
by
the
western
people
of
the
day
from
the
early
days
of
written
or
legendary
history
metempsychosis
has
been
the
accepted
belief
of
many
of
the
most
intelligent
of
the
race
it
is
found
underlying
the
magnificent
civilization
of
ancient
egypt
and
from
thence
it
traveled
to
the
western
world
being
held
as
the
highest
truth
by
such
teachers
as
pythagoras
empedocles
plato
virgil
and
ovid
plato
dialogues
are
full
of
this
teaching
the
hindus
have
always
held
to
it
the
persians
inspired
by
their
learned
magi
accepted
it
implicitly
the
ancient
druids
and
priests
of
gaul
as
well
as
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
germany
held
to
it
traces
of
it
may
be
found
in
the
remains
of
the
aztec
peruvian
and
mexican
civilizations
the
eleusinian
mysteries
of
greece
the
roman
mysteries
and
the
inner
doctrines
of
the
cabbala
of
the
hebrews
all
taught
the
truths
of
metempsychosis
the
early
christian
fathers
the
gnostic
and
manichaeans
and
other
sects
of
the
early
christian
people
all
held
to
the
doctrine
the
modern
german
philosophers
have
treated
it
with
the
greatest
respect
if
indeed
they
did
not
at
least
partially
accept
it
many
modern
writers
have
considered
it
gravely
and
with
respect
the
following
quotations
will
give
an
idea
of
how
the
wind
is
blowing
in
the
west
of
all
the
theories
respecting
the
origin
of
the
soul
metempsychosis
seems
to
me
the
most
plausible
and
therefore
the
one
most
likely
to
throw
light
on
the
question
of
a
life
to
come
it
would
be
curious
if
we
should
find
science
and
philosophy
taking
up
again
the
old
theory
of
metempsychosis
remodelling
it
to
suit
our
present
modes
of
religious
and
scientific
thought
and
launching
it
again
on
the
wide
ocean
of
human
belief
but
stranger
things
have
happened
in
the
history
of
human
opinions
freeman
if
we
could
legitimately
determine
any
question
of
belief
by
the
number
of
its
adherents
the
would
apply
to
metempsychosis
more
fitly
than
to
any
other
i
think
it
is
quite
as
likely
to
be
revived
and
to
come
to
the
front
as
any
rival
wm
it
seems
to
me
a
firm
and
faith
in
the
doctrine
of
christian
metempsychosis
might
help
to
regenerate
the
world
for
it
would
be
a
faith
not
hedged
around
with
many
of
the
difficulties
and
objections
which
beset
other
forms
of
doctrine
and
it
offers
distinct
and
pungent
motives
for
trying
to
lead
a
more
christian
life
and
for
loving
and
helping
our
francis
the
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
may
almost
claim
to
be
a
natural
or
innate
belief
in
the
human
mind
if
we
may
judge
from
its
wide
diffusion
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
its
prevalence
throughout
the
historical
francis
when
christianity
first
swept
over
europe
the
inner
thought
of
its
leaders
was
deeply
tinctured
with
this
truth
the
church
tried
ineffectually
to
eradicate
it
but
in
various
sects
it
kept
sprouting
forth
beyond
the
time
of
erigina
and
bonaventura
its
mediaeval
advocates
every
great
intuitional
soul
as
paracelsus
boehme
and
swedenborg

adhered

the

and
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
this
the
early
part
of
the
twentieth
century
the
general
public
has
been
made
familiar
with
the
idea
of
metempsychosis
under
the
name
of
by
means
of
the
great
volume
of
literature
issued
by
the
theosophical
society
and
its
allied
following
no
longer
is
the
thought
a
novelty
to
the
western
thinker
and
many
have
found
within
themselves
a
corroborative
sense
of
its
truth
in
fact
to
many
the
mere
mention
of
the
idea
has
been
sufficient
to
awaken
faint
shadowy
memories
of
past
lives
and
to
such
many
heretofore
unaccountable
traits
of
character
tastes
inclinations
sympathies
dislikes
have
been
explained
the
western
world
has
been
made
familiar
with
the
idea
of
the
of
souls
into
new
bodies
under
the
term
of
which
means
a
into
flesh
the
word
incarnate
being
derived
from
the
words
and
meaning
flesh
the
english
word
meaning
to
clothe
with
flesh
etc
the
word
metempsychosis
which
we
use
in
this
lesson
is
concerned
rather
with
the
passage
of
the
soul
from
one
tenement
to
another
the
fleshly
idea
being
merely
incidental
the
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
or
together
with
its
accompanying
doctrine
karma
or
spiritual
cause
and
effect
is
one
of
the
great
foundation
stones
of
the
yogi
philosophy
as
indeed
it
is
of
the
entire
system
of
systems
of
oriental
philosophy
and
thought
unless
one
understands
metempsychosis
he
will
never
be
able
to
understand
the
eastern
teachings
for
he
will
be
without
the
key
you
who
have
read
the
that
wonderful
hindu
epic
will
remember
how
the
thread
of
runs
through
it
all
you
remember
the
words
of
to
as
the
soul
wearing
this
material
body
experienceth
the
stages
of
infancy
youth
manhood
and
old
age
even
so
shall
it
in
due
time
pass
on
to
another
body
and
in
other
incarnations
shall
it
again
live
and
move
and
play
its
part
these
bodies
which
act
as
enveloping
coverings
for
the
souls
occupying
them
are
but
finite
things
things
of
the
moment
and
not
the
real
man
at
all
they
perish
as
all
finite
things
perish
let
them
perish
as
a
man
throweth
away
his
old
garments
replacing
them
with
new
and
brighter
ones
even
so
the
dweller
of
the
body
having
quitted
its
old
mortal
frame
entereth
into
others
which
are
new
and
freshly
prepared
for
it
weapons
pierce
not
the
real
man
nor
doth
the
fire
burn
him
the
water
affecteth
him
not
nor
the
wind
drieth
him
nor
bloweth
him
away
for
he
is
impregnable
and
impervious
to
these
things
of
the
world
of
change
he
is
eternal
permanent
unchangeable
and
unalterable
real
this
view
of
life
gives
to
the
one
who
holds
to
it
an
entirely
different
mental
attitude
he
no
longer
identifies
himself
with
the
particular
body
that
he
may
be
occupying
nor
with
any
other
body
for
that
matter
he
learns
to
regard
his
body
just
as
he
would
a
garment
which
he
is
wearing
useful
to
him
for
certain
purposes
but
which
will
in
time
be
discarded
and
thrown
aside
for
a
better
one
and
one
better
adapted
to
his
new
requirements
and
needs
so
firmly
is
this
idea
embedded
in
the
consciousness
of
the
hindus
that
they
will
often
say
my
body
is
tired
or
my
body
is
hungry
or
my
body
is
full
of
energy
rather
than
that
i
am
this
or
that
thing
and
this
consciousness
once
attained
gives
to
one
a
sense
of
strength
security
and
power
unknown
to
him
who
regards
his
body
as
himself
the
first
step
for
the
student
who
wishes
to
grasp
the
idea
of
metempsychosis
and
who
wishes
to
awaken
in
his
consciousness
a
certainty
of
its
truth
is
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
idea
of
his
i
being
a
thing
independent
and
a
part
from
his
body
although
using
the
latter
as
an
abiding
place
and
a
useful
shelter
and
instrument
for
the
time
being
many
writers
on
the
subject
of
metempsychosis
have
devoted
much
time
labor
and
argument
to
prove
the
reasonableness
of
the
doctrine
upon
purely
speculative
philosophical
or
metaphysical
grounds
and
while
we
believe
that
such
efforts
are
praiseworthy
for
the
reason
that
many
persons
must
be
first
convinced
in
that
way
still
we
feel
that
one
must
really
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
from
something
within
his
own
consciousness
before
he
will
really
it
to
be
truth
one
may
convince
himself
of
the
logical
necessity
of
the
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
but
at
the
same
time
he
may
drop
the
matter
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
still
who
knows
but
when
one
begins
to
feel
within
himself
the
awakening
consciousness
of
a
something
in
the
past
not
to
speak
of
the
flashes
of
memory
and
feeling
of
former
acquaintance
with
the
subject
then
and
then
only
does
he
begin
to
many
people
have
had
peculiar
experiences
that
are
accountable
only
upon
the
hypothesis
of
metempsychosis
who
has
not
experienced
the
consciousness
of
having
the
thing
thought
it
some
time
in
the
dim
past
who
has
not
witnessed
new
scenes
that
appear
old
very
old
who
has
not
met
persons
for
the
first
time
whose
presence
awakened
memories
of
a
past
lying
far
back
in
the
misty
ages
of
long
ago
who
has
not
been
seized
at
times
with
the
consciousness
of
a
mighty
oldness
of
soul
who
has
not
heard
music
often
entirely
new
compositions
which
somehow
awakens
memories
of
similar
strains
scenes
places
faces
voices
lands
associations
and
events
sounding
dimly
on
the
strings
of
memory
as
the
breezes
of
the
harmony
floats
over
them
who
has
not
gazed
at
some
old
painting
or
piece
of
statuary
with
the
sense
of
having
seen
it
all
before
who
has
not
lived
through
events
which
brought
with
them
a
certainty
of
being
merely
a
repetition
of
some
shadowy
occurrences
away
back
in
lives
lived
long
ago
who
has
not
felt
the
influence
of
the
mountain
the
sea
the
desert
coming
to
them
when
they
are
far
from
such
scenes
coming
so
vividly
as
to
cause
the
actual
scene
of
the
present
to
fade
into
comparative
unreality
who
has
not
had
these
experiences
we
writers
poets
and
others
who
carry
messages
to
the
world
have
testified
to
these
things
and
nearly
every
man
or
woman
who
hears
the
message
recognizes
it
as
something
having
correspondence
in
his
or
her
own
life
sir
walter
scott
tells
us
in
his
diary
i
can
not
i
am
sure
tell
if
it
is
worth
marking
down
that
yesterday
at
dinner
time
i
was
strangely
haunted
by
what
i
would
call
the
sense
of
preexistence
a
confused
idea
that
nothing
that
passed
was
said
for
the
first
time
that
the
same
topics
had
been
discussed
and
the
same
persons
had
stated
the
same
opinions
on
them
the
sensation
was
so
strong
as
to
resemble
what
is
called
the
mirage
in
the
desert
and
a
calenture
on
board
ship
the
same
writer
in
one
of
his
novels
guy
mannering
makes
one
of
his
characters
say
why
is
it
that
some
scenes
awaken
thoughts
which
belong
as
it
were
to
dreams
of
early
and
shadowy
recollections
such
as
old
brahmin
moonshine
would
have
ascribed
to
a
state
of
previous
existence
how
often
do
we
find
ourselves
in
society
which
we
have
never
before
met
and
yet
feel
impressed
with
a
mysterious
and
consciousness
that
neither
the
scene
nor
the
speakers
nor
the
subject
are
entirely
new
nay
feel
as
if
we
could
anticipate
that
part
of
the
conversation
which
has
not
yet
taken
place
bulwer
speaks
of
that
strange
kind
of
inner
and
spiritual
memory
which
so
often
recalls
to
us
places
and
persons
we
have
never
seen
before
and
which
platonists
would
resolve
to
be
the
unquenched
consciousness
of
a
former
life
and
again
he
says
how
strange
is
it
that
at
times
a
feeling
comes
over
us
as
we
gaze
upon
certain
places
which
associates
the
scene
either
with
some
dim
remembered
and
dreamlike
images
of
the
past
or
with
a
prophetic
and
fearful
omen
of
the
future
every
one
has
known
a
similar
strange
and
indistinct
feeling
at
certain
times
and
places
and
with
a
similar
inability
to
trace
the
cause
poe
has
written
these
words
on
the
subject
we
walk
about
amid
the
destinies
of
our
world
existence
accompanied
by
dim
but
ever
present
memories
of
a
destiny
more
vast
very
distant
in
the
bygone
time
and
infinitely
awful
we
live
out
a
youth
peculiarly
haunted
by
such
dreams
yet
never
mistaking
them
for
dreams
as
memories
we
know
them
during
our
youth
the
distinctness
is
too
clear
to
deceive
us
even
for
a
moment
but
the
doubt
of
manhood
dispels
these
feelings
as
illusions
home
relates
an
interesting
incident
in
his
life
which
had
a
marked
effect
upon
his
beliefs
thereafter
he
relates
that
upon
an
occasion
when
he
visited
a
strange
house
in
london
he
was
shown
into
a
room
to
wait
he
says
on
looking
around
to
my
astonishment
everything
appeared
perfectly
familiar
to
me
i
seemed
to
recognize
every
object
i
said
to
myself
is
this
i
have
never
been
here
before
and
yet
i
have
seen
all
this
and
if
so
then
there
must
be
a
very
peculiar
knot
in
that
shutter
he
proceeded
to
examine
the
shutter
and
much
to
his
amazement
the
knot
was
there
we
have
recently
heard
of
a
similar
case
told
by
an
old
lady
who
formerly
lived
in
the
far
west
of
the
united
states
she
states
that
upon
one
occasion
a
party
was
wandering
on
the
desert
in
her
part
of
the
country
and
found
themselves
out
of
water
as
that
part
of
the
desert
was
unfamiliar
even
to
the
guides
the
prospect
for
water
looked
very
poor
indeed
after
a
fruitless
search
of
several
hours
one
of
the
party
a
perfect
stranger
to
that
part
of
the
country
suddenly
pressed
his
hand
to
his
head
and
acted
in
a
dazed
manner
crying
out
i
know
that
a
is
over
to
the
right
this
way
and
away
he
started
with
the
party
after
him
after
a
journey
they
reached
an
old
hidden
that
was
unknown
even
to
the
oldest
man
in
the
party
the
stranger
said
that
he
did
not
understand
the
matter
but
that
he
had
somehow
experienced
a
sensation
of
been
there
and
knowing
just
where
the
was
located
an
old
indian
who
was
questioned
about
the
matter
afterward
stated
that
the
place
had
been
well
known
to
his
people
who
formerly
travelled
much
on
that
part
of
the
desert
and
that
they
had
legends
relating
to
the
hidden
running
back
for
many
generations
in
this
case
it
was
remarked
that
the
was
situated
in
such
a
peculiar
and
unusual
manner
as
to
render
it
almost
undiscoverable
even
to
people
familiar
with
the
characteristics
of
that
part
of
the
country
the
old
lady
who
related
the
story
had
it
direct
from
the
lips
of
one
of
the
party
who
regarded
it
as
something
queer
but
who
had
never
even
heard
of
metempsychosis
a
correspondent
of
an
english
magazine
writes
as
follows
a
gentleman
of
high
intellectual
attainments
now
deceased
once
told
me
that
he
had
dreamed
of
being
in
a
strange
city
so
vividly
that
he
remembered
the
streets
houses
and
public
buildings
as
distinctly
as
those
of
any
place
he
ever
visited
a
few
weeks
later
he
was
induced
to
visit
a
panorama
in
leicester
square
when
he
was
startled
by
seeing
the
city
of
which
he
had
dreamed
the
likeness
was
perfect
except
that
one
additional
church
appeared
in
the
picture
he
was
so
struck
by
the
circumstance
that
he
spoke
to
the
exhibitor
assuming
for
the
purpose
the
air
of
a
traveller
acquainted
with
the
place
when
he
was
informed
that
the
church
was
a
recent
erection
the
fact
of
the
addition
of
the
church
seems
to
place
the
incident
within
the
rule
of
awakened
memories
of
scenes
known
in
a
past
life
for
clairvoyance
astral
travel
would
show
the
scene
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
dream
not
as
it
had
been
years
before
charles
dickens
mentions
a
remarkable
impression
in
his
work
pictures
from
italy
in
the
foreground
was
a
group
of
silent
peasant
girls
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
little
bridge
looking
now
up
at
the
sky
now
down
into
the
water
in
the
distance
a
deep
dell
the
shadow
of
an
approaching
night
on
everything
if
i
had
been
murdered
there
in
some
former
life
i
could
not
have
seemed
to
remember
the
place
more
thoroughly
or
with
more
emphatic
chilling
of
the
blood
and
the
real
remembrance
of
it
acquired
in
that
minute
is
so
strengthened
by
the
imaginary
recollection
that
i
hardly
think
i
could
forget
it
we
have
recently
met
two
people
in
america
who
had
very
vivid
memories
of
incidents
in
their
past
life
one
of
these
a
lady
has
a
perfect
horror
of
large
bodies
of
water
such
as
the
great
lakes
or
the
ocean
although
she
was
born
and
has
lived
the
greater
part
of
her
life
inland
far
removed
from
any
great
body
of
water
she
has
a
distinct
recollection
of
falling
from
a
large
vessel
of
peculiar
lines
and
drowning
she
was
quite
overcome
upon
her
first
visit
to
the
field
museum
in
chicago
where
there
were
exhibited
a
number
of
models
of
queer
vessels
used
by
primitive
people
she
pointed
out
one
similar
in
shape
and
lines
to
the
one
she
remembers
as
having
fallen
from
in
some
past
life
the
second
case
mentioned
is
that
of
a
married
couple
who
met
each
other
in
a
country
foreign
to
both
on
their
travels
they
fell
in
love
with
each
other
and
both
have
felt
that
their
marriage
was
a
reunion
rather
than
a
new
attachment
the
husband
one
day
shortly
after
their
marriage
told
his
wife
in
a
rather
way
that
he
had
occasional
flashes
of
memory
of
having
held
in
his
arms
in
the
dim
past
a
woman
whose
face
he
could
not
recall
but
who
wore
a
strange
necklace
he
describing
the
details
of
the
latter
the
wife
said
nothing
but
after
her
husband
had
left
for
his
office
she
went
to
the
attic
and
unpacked
an
old
trunk
containing
some
odds
and
ends
relics
heirlooms
and
drew
from
it
an
old
necklace
of
peculiar
pattern
that
her
grandfather
had
brought
back
from
india
where
he
had
lived
in
his
younger
days
and
which
had
been
in
the
family
ever
since
she
laid
the
necklace
on
the
table
so
that
her
husband
would
see
it
upon
his
return
the
moment
his
eyes
fell
upon
it
he
turned
white
as
death
and
gasped
my
god
the
necklace
a
writer
in
a
western
journal
gives
the
following
story
of
a
southern
woman
when
i
was
in
heidelberg
germany
attending
a
convention
of
mystics
in
company
with
some
friends
i
paid
my
first
visit
to
the
ruined
heidelberg
castle
as
i
approached
it
i
was
impressed
with
the
existence
of
a
peculiar
room
in
an
inaccessible
portion
of
the
building
a
paper
and
pencil
were
provided
me
and
i
drew
a
diagram
of
the
room
even
to
its
peculiar
floor
my
diagram
and
description
were
perfect
when
we
afterwards
visited
the
room
in
some
way
not
yet
clear
to
me
i
have
been
connected
with
that
apartment
still
another
impression
came
to
me
with
regard
to
a
book
which
i
was
made
to
feel
was
in
the
old
library
of
the
heidelberg
university
i
not
only
knew
what
the
book
was
but
even
felt
that
a
certain
name
of
an
old
german
professor
would
be
found
written
in
it
communicating
this
feeling
to
one
of
the
mystics
at
the
convention
a
search
was
made
for
the
volume
but
it
was
not
found
still
the
impression
clung
to
me
and
another
effort
was
made
to
find
the
book
this
time
we
were
rewarded
for
our
pains
sure
enough
there
on
the
margin
of
one
of
the
leaves
was
the
very
name
i
had
been
given
in
such
a
strange
manner
other
things
at
the
same
time
went
to
convince
me
that
i
was
in
possession
of
the
soul
of
a
person
who
had
known
heidelberg
two
or
three
centuries
ago
a
contributor
to
an
old
magazine
relates
among
other
instances
the
following
regarding
a
friend
who
remembers
having
died
in
india
during
the
youth
of
some
former
life
he
states
he
sees
the
bronzed
attendants
gathered
about
his
cradle
in
their
white
dresses
they
are
fanning
him
and
as
they
gaze
he
passes
into
unconsciousness
much
of
his
description
concerned
points
of
which
he
knew
nothing
from
any
other
source
but
all
was
true
to
the
life
and
enabled
me
to
fix
on
india
as
the
scene
which
he
recalled
while
comparatively
few
among
the
western
races
are
able
to
remember
more
than
fragments
of
their
past
lives
in
india
it
is
quite
common
for
a
man
well
developed
spiritually
to
clearly
remember
the
incidents
and
details
of
former
incarnations
and
the
evidence
of
the
awakening
of
such
power
causes
little
more
than
passing
interest
among
his
people
there
is
as
we
shall
see
later
a
movement
toward
conscious
metempsychosis
and
many
of
the
race
are
just
moving
on
to
that
plane
in
india
the
highly
developed
individuals
grow
into
a
clear
recollection
of
their
past
lives
when
they
reach
the
age
of
puberty
and
when
their
brains
are
developed
sufficiently
to
grasp
the
knowledge
locked
up
in
the
depths
of
the
soul
in
the
meantime
the
memory
of
the
past
is
locked
away
in
the
recesses
of
his
mind
just
as
are
many
facts
and
incidents
of
his
present
life
so
locked
away
to
be
remembered
only
when
some
one
mentions
the
subject
or
some
circumstance
serves
to
supply
the
associative
link
to
the
apparently
forgotten
matter
regarding
the
faculty
of
memory
in
our
present
lives
we
would
quote
the
following
from
the
pen
of
william
knight
printed
in
the
fortnightly
review
he
says
memory
of
the
details
of
the
past
is
absolutely
impossible
the
power
of
the
conservative
faculty
though
relatively
great
is
extremely
limited
we
forget
the
larger
portion
of
experience
soon
after
we
have
passed
through
it
and
we
should
be
able
to
recall
the
particulars
of
our
past
years
filling
all
the
missing
links
of
consciousness
since
we
entered
on
the
present
life
before
we
were
in
a
position
to
remember
our
experience
birth
must
necessarily
be
preceded
by
crossing
the
river
of
oblivion
while
the
capacity
for
fresh
acquisition
survives
and
the
garnered
wealth
of
old
experience
determines
the
amount
and
character
of
the
new
another
startling
evidence
of
the
proof
of
metempsychosis
is
afforded
us
in
the
cases
of
infant
prodigies
which
defy
any
other
explanation
take
the
cases
of
the
manifestation
of
musical
talent
in
certain
children
at
an
early
age
for
instance
take
the
case
of
mozart
who
at
the
age
of
four
was
able
to
not
only
perform
difficult
pieces
on
the
piano
but
actually
composed
original
works
of
merit
not
only
did
he
manifest
the
highest
faculty
of
sound
and
note
but
also
an
instinctive
ability
to
compose
and
arrange
music
which
ability
was
superior
to
that
of
many
men
who
had
devoted
years
of
their
life
to
study
and
practice
the
laws
of
harmony
the
science
of
commingling
tones
was
to
him
not
the
work
of
years
but
a
faculty
born
in
him
there
are
many
similar
cases
of
record
heredity
does
not
explain
these
instances
of
genius
for
in
many
of
the
recorded
cases
none
of
the
ancestors
manifested
any
talent
or
ability
from
whom
did
shakespeare
inherit
his
genius
from
whom
did
plato
derive
his
wonderful
thought
from
what
ancestor
did
abraham
lincoln
inherit
his
character
coming
from
a
line
of
plain
poor
people
and
possessing
all
of
the
physical
attributes
and
characteristics
of
his
ancestry
he
nevertheless
manifested
a
mind
which
placed
him
among
the
foremost
of
his
race
does
not
metempsychosis
give
us
the
only
possible
key
is
it
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
abilities
displayed
by
the
infant
genius
and
the
talent
of
the
men
who
spring
from
obscure
origin
have
their
root
in
the
experiences
of
a
previous
life
then
take
the
cases
of
children
at
school
children
of
even
the
same
family
manifest
different
degrees
of
receptivity
to
certain
studies
some
take
to
one
thing
and
some
to
another
some
find
arithmetic
so
easy
that
they
almost
absorb
it
intuitively
while
grammar
is
a
hard
task
for
them
while
their
brothers
and
sisters
find
the
exact
reverse
to
be
true
how
many
have
found
that
when
they
would
take
up
some
new
study
it
is
almost
like
recalling
something
already
learned
do
you
student
who
are
now
reading
these
lines
take
your
own
case
does
not
all
this
teaching
seem
to
you
like
the
repetition
of
some
lesson
learned
long
ago
is
it
not
like
remembering
something
already
learned
rather
than
the
learning
of
some
new
truth
were
you
not
attracted
to
these
studies
in
the
first
place
by
a
feeling
that
you
had
known
it
all
before
somewhere
somehow
does
not
your
mind
leap
ahead
of
the
lesson
and
see
what
is
coming
next
long
before
you
have
turned
the
pages
these
inward
evidences
of
the
fact
of
are
so
strong
that
they
outweigh
the
most
skillful
appeal
to
the
intellect
this
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
truth
of
metempsychosis
explains
why
the
belief
in
it
is
sweeping
over
the
western
world
at
such
a
rapid
rate
the
mere
mention
of
the
idea
to
many
people
who
have
never
before
heard
of
it
is
sufficient
to
cause
them
to
recognize
its
truth
and
though
they
may
not
understand
the
laws
of
its
operation
yet
deep
down
in
their
consciousness
they
find
a
something
that
convinces
them
of
its
truth
in
spite
of
the
objections
that
are
urged
against
the
teaching
it
is
making
steady
headway
and
progress
the
progress
of
the
belief
in
metempsychosis
however
has
been
greatly
retarded
by
the
many
theories
and
dogmas
attached
to
it
by
some
of
the
teachers
not
to
speak
of
the
degrading
ideas
of
into
the
bodies
of
animals
which
have
polluted
the
spring
of
truth
there
are
to
be
found
many
other
features
of
teaching
and
theory
which
repel
people
and
cause
them
to
try
to
kill
out
of
the
minds
the
glimmer
of
truth
that
they
find
there
the
human
soul
instinctively
revolts
against
the
teaching
that
it
is
bound
to
the
wheel
or
compulsorily
without
choice
compelled
to
live
in
body
after
body
until
great
cycles
are
past
the
soul
perhaps
already
sick
of
and
longing
to
pass
on
to
higher
planes
of
existence
fights
against
such
teaching
and
it
does
well
to
so
fight
for
the
truth
is
nearer
to
its
hearts
desire
there
is
no
soul
longing
that
does
not
carry
with
it
the
prophecy
of
its
own
fulfillment
and
so
it
is
in
this
case
it
is
true
that
the
soul
of
one
filled
with
earthly
desires
and
craving
for
material
things
will
by
the
very
force
of
those
desires
be
drawn
back
to
earthly
in
a
body
best
suited
for
the
gratification
of
the
longings
desires
and
cravings
that
it
finds
within
itself
but
it
is
likewise
true
that
the
soul
is
not
compiled
to
return
unless
its
own
desires
bring
it
back
desire
is
the
key
note
of
metempsychosis
although
up
to
a
certain
stage
it
may
operate
unconsciously
the
sum
of
the
desires
of
a
soul
regulate
its
those
who
have
become
sickened
of
all
that
earth
has
for
them
at
this
stage
of
its
evolution
may
and
do
rest
in
states
of
existence
far
removed
from
earth
scenes
until
the
race
progresses
far
enough
to
afford
the
resting
soul
the
opportunities
and
environments
that
it
so
earnestly
craves
and
more
than
this
when
man
reaches
a
certain
stage
the
process
of
metempsychosis
no
longer
remains
unconscious
but
he
enters
into
a
conscious
knowing
willing
passage
from
one
life
to
another
and
when
that
stage
is
reached
a
full
memory
of
the
past
lives
is
unfolded
and
life
to
such
a
soul
becomes
as
the
life
of
a
day
succeeded
by
a
night
and
then
the
awakening
into
another
day
with
full
knowledge
and
recollection
of
the
events
of
the
day
before
we
are
in
merely
the
babyhood
of
the
race
now
and
the
fuller
life
of
the
conscious
soul
lies
before
us
yea
even
now
it
is
being
entered
into
by
the
few
of
the
race
that
have
progressed
sufficiently
far
on
the
path
and
you
student
who
feel
within
you
that
craving
for
conscious
and
future
spiritual
evolution
and
the
distaste
for
and
horror
of
a
further
blind
unconscious
into
the
know
you
that
this
longing
on
your
part
is
but
an
indication
of
what
lies
before
you
it
is
the
strange
subtle
awakening
of
the
nature
within
you
which
betokens
the
higher
state
just
as
the
young
person
feels
within
his
or
her
body
strange
emotions
longings
and
stirrings
which
betoken
the
passage
from
the
child
state
into
that
of
manhood
or
womanhood
so
do
these
spiritual
longings
desires
and
cravings
betoken
the
passage
from
unconscious
into
conscious
knowing
metempsychosis
when
you
have
passed
from
the
scene
of
your
present
labors
in
our
next
lesson
we
shall
consider
the
history
of
the
race
as
its
souls
passed
on
from
the
savage
tribes
to
the
man
of
it
is
the
history
of
the
race
the
history
of
the
individual
your
own
history
student
the
record
of
that
through
which
you
have
passed
to
become
that
which
you
now
are
and
as
you
have
climbed
step
after
step
up
the
arduous
path
so
will
you
hereafter
climb
still
higher
paths
but
no
longer
in
unconsciousness
but
with
your
spiritual
eyes
wide
open
to
the
rays
of
truth
pouring
forth
from
the
great
central
sun
the
absolute
concluding
this
lesson
we
would
quote
two
selections
from
the
american
poet
whitman
whose
strange
genius
was
undoubtedly
the
result
of
vague
memories
springing
from
a
previous
life
and
which
burst
into
utterances
often
not
more
than
half
understood
by
the
mind
that
gave
them
birth
whitman
says
facing
west
from
california
shores
inquiring
tireless
seeking
what
is
yet
unfound
a
a
child
very
old
over
waves
toward
the
house
of
maternity
the
land
of
migrations
look
afar
look
off
the
shores
of
my
western
sea
the
circle
almost
circled
for
starting
westward
from
hindustan
from
the
vales
of
kashmere
from

from
the

from

the

and
the

from

long
having
wandered
since
round
the
earth
having
wandered
now
i
face
home
again
very
pleased
and
joyous
but
where
is
what
i
started
for
so
long
ago
and
why
is
it
yet
unfound
i
know
i
am
deathless
i
know
that
this
orbit
of
mine
can
not
be
swept
by
a

and
whether
i
come
to
my
own

in

or
ten

years
i
can
cheerfully
take
it
now
or
with

can
wait

you
are

no

i

and

and

and
this
quotation
from
the
american
poet
willis
but
what
a
mystery
this
erring
mind
it
wakes
within
a
frame
of
various
powers
a
stranger
in
a
new
and
wondrous
world
it
brings
an
instinct
from
some
other
sphere
for
its
fine
senses
are
familiar
all
and
with
the
unconscious
habit
of
a
dream
it
calls
and
they
obey
the
priceless
sight
springs
to
its
curious
organ
and
the
ear
learns
strangely
to
detect
the
articulate
air
in
its
unseen
divisions
and
the
tongue
gets
its
miraculous
lesson
with
the
rest
and
in
the
midst
of
an
obedient
throng
of
well
trained
ministers
the
mind
goes
forth
to
search
the
secrets
of
its
new
found
home
the
tenth
lesson
spiritual
evolution
one
of
the
things
that
repel
many
persons
who
have
had
their
attention
directed
to
the
subject
of
metempsychosis
for
the
first
time
is
the
idea
that
they
have
evolved
a
from
individual
lowly
forms
for
instance
that
they
have
at
one
time
been
an
individual
plant
and
then
an
individual
animal
form
and
then
an
individual
higher
animal
form
and
so
on
until
now
they
are
the
particular
individual
human
form
contemplating
the
subject
this
idea
which
has
been
taught
by
many
teachers
is
repellent
to
the
average
mind
for
obvious
reasons
and
naturally
so
for
it
has
no
foundation
in
truth
while
this
lesson
is
principally
concerned
with
the
subject
of
the
spiritual
evolution
of
the
human
soul
since
it
became
a
human
soul
still
it
may
be
as
well
to
mention
the
previous
phase
of
evolution
briefly
in
order
to
prevent
misconception
and
to
dispel
previously
acquired
error
the
atom
although
it
possesses
life
and
a
certain
degree
of
mind
and
acts
as
an
individual
temporarily
has
no
permanent
individuality
that
reincarnates
when
the
atom
is
evolved
it
becomes
a
centre
of
energy
in
the
great
atomic
principle
and
when
it
is
finally
dissolved
it
resolves
itself
back
into
its
original
state
and
its
life
as
an
individual
atom
ceases
although
the
experience
it
has
gained
becomes
the
property
of
the
entire
principle
it
is
as
if
a
body
of
water
were
to
be
resolved
into
millions
of
tiny
for
a
time
and
each
was
then
to
acquire
certain
outside
material
in
solution
in
that
case
each
when
it
again
returned
to
the
body
of
water
would
carry
with
it
its
foreign
material
which
would
become
the
property
of
the
whole
and
subsequently
formed
would
carry
in
their
substance
a
particle
of
the
foreign
matter
brought
back
home
by
the
previous
generation
of
dewdrops
and
would
thus
be
a
little
different
from
their
predecessors
and
this
process
continuing
for
many
generations
of
would
ultimately
cause
the
greatest
changes
in
the
composition
of
the
successive
generations
this
in
short
is
the
story
of
the
change
and
improving
forms
of
life
from
the
atoms
into
the
elements
from
the
lower
elements
into
those
forming
protoplasm
from
the
protoplasm
to
the
lower
forms
of
animal
life
from
these
lower
forms
on
to
higher
forms
this
is
the
story
but
it
is
all
a
counterpart
of
the
and
the
body
of
water
the
human
soul
is
the
plants
and
the
lower
forms
of
animal
life
are
not
permanent
individual
souls
but
each
family
is
a
corresponding
to
the
body
of
water
from
which
the
arose
from
these
family
gradually
break
off
minor
groups
representing
species
and
so
on
into
at
last
when
the
forms
reach
the
plane
of
man
the
breaks
itself
up
into
individual
and
true
metempsychosis
begins
that
is
individual
human
soul
becomes
a
permanent
individual
destined
to
evolve
and
perfect
itself
along
the
lines
of
spiritual
evolution
and
from
this
point
begins
our
story
of
spiritual
evolution
the
story
of
man
the
individual
begins
amidst
humble
surroundings
primitive
man
but
little
above
the
level
of
the
lower
animals
in
point
of
intelligence
has
nevertheless
that
distinguishing
mark
of
individuality
which
is
the
demarkation
between
beast
and
man
and
even
the
lowest
of
the
lowest
races
had
at
least
a
trace
of
this
which
made
of
them
individuals
and
caused
the
fragment
of
the
to
separate
itself
from
the
general
principle
animating
the
race
and
to
fasten
its
i
conscious
upon
itself
rather
than
upon
the
underlying
along
instinctive
lines
do
you
know
just
what
this
is
and
how
it
differs
from
the
physical
consciousness
of
the
lower
animals
perhaps
we
had
better
pause
a
moment
to
consider
it
at
this
place
the
lower
animals
are
of
course
conscious
of
the
bodies
and
their
wants
feelings
emotions
desires
and
their
actions
are
in
response
to
the
animating
impulses
coming
from
this
plane
of
consciousness
but
it
stops
there
they
know
but
they
do
not
know
that
they
know
that
is
they
have
not
yet
arrived
at
a
state
in
which
they
can
think
of
themselves
as
i
and
to
reason
upon
their
thoughts
and
mental
operations
it
is
like
the
consciousness
of
a
very
young
child
which
feels
and
knows
its
sensations
and
wants
but
is
unable
to
think
of
itself
as
i
and
to
turn
the
mental
gaze
inward
in
another
book
of
these
series
we
have
used
the
illustration
of
the
horse
which
has
been
left
standing
out
in
the
cold
sleet
and
rain
and
which
undoubtedly
feels
and
knows
the
unpleasant
sensations
arising
therefrom
and
longs
to
get
away
from
the
unpleasant
environment
but
still
he
is
unable
to
analyze
his
mental
states
and
wonder
whether
his
master
will
come
out
to
him
soon
or
think
how
cruel
it
is
to
keep
him
out
of
his
warm
comfortable
stable
or
wonder
whether
he
will
be
taken
out
in
the
cold
rain
again
tomorrow
or
feel
envious
of
other
horses
who
are
indoors
or
wonder
why
he
is
kept
out
cold
nights
etc
in
short
the
horse
is
unable
to
think
as
would
a
reasoning
man
under
just
the
same
circumstances
he
is
aware
of
the
discomfort
just
as
would
be
the
man
and
he
would
run
away
home
if
he
were
able
just
as
would
the
man
but
he
is
not
able
to
pity
himself
nor
to
think
about
his
personality
as
would
a
man
he
is
not
able
to
wonder
whether
life
is
worth
the
living
as
would
a
man
he
knows
but
is
not
able
to
reflect
upon
the
knowing
in
the
above
illustration
the
principal
point
is
that
the
horse
does
not
know
himself
as
an
entity
while
even
the
most
primitive
man
is
able
to
so
recognize
himself
as
an
i
if
the
horse
were
able
to
think
in
words
he
would
think
feel
cold
hurt
but
he
would
be
unable
to
think
feel
am
cold
am
hurt
etc
the
thought
i
would
be
missing
it
is
true
that
the
i
consciousness
of
the
primitive
man
was
slight
and
was
but
a
degree
above
the
physical
consciousness
of
the
higher
apes
but
nevertheless
it
had
sprung
into
being
never
again
to
be
lost
the
primitive
man
was
like
a
child
a
few
years
old
he
was
able
to
say
i
and
to
think
i
had
become
an
individual
and
this
individual
soul
inhabited
and
animated
a
body
but
little
removed
from
that
of
an
ape
but
this
new
consciousness
began
to
mould
that
rude
body
and
the
ascent
was
begun
each
generation
showed
a
physical
improvement
over
that
of
the
preceding
one
according
to
the
lines
of
physical
evolution
and
as
the
developing
soul
demanded
more
perfect
and
developed
bodies
the
bodies
were
evolved
to
meet
the
demand
for
the
mental
demand
has
ever
been
the
cause
of
the
physical
form
the
soul
of
the
primitive
man
reincarnated
almost
immediately
after
the
death
of
the
physical
body
because
the
experiences
gained
were
mostly
along
the
lines
of
the
physical
the
mental
planes
being
scarcely
brought
into
play
while
the
higher
and
spiritual
faculties
were
almost
entirely
obscured
from
sight
life
after
life
the
soul
of
the
primitive
man
lived
out
in
rapid
succession
but
in
each
new
embodiment
there
was
a
slight
advance
over
that
of
the
previous
one
experience
or
rather
the
result
of
experiences
were
carried
over
and
profited
by
new
lessons
were
learned
and
unlearned
improved
upon
or
discarded
and
the
race
grew
and
unfolded
after
a
time
the
number
of
advancing
souls
which
had
outstripped
their
fellows
in
progress
became
sufficiently
large
for
to
be
formed
and
so
the
branching
off
process
began
in
this
way
the
various
races
and
types
were
formed
and
the
progress
of
mankind
gained
headway
at
this
point
we
may
as
well
consider
the
history
of
the
races
of
mankind
that
we
may
see
how
the
great
of
soul
has
ever
pressed
onward
marking
higher
and
still
higher
stages
of
progress
and
also
how
the
various
minor
waves
of
the
great
wave
pushed
in
and
then
receded
only
to
be
followed
by
still
higher
waves
the
story
is
most
interesting
the
yogi
teachings
inform
us
that
the
grand
cycle
of
man
life
on
the
earth
is
composed
of
seven
cycles
of
which
we
are
now
living
in
the
part
of
the
fifth
cycle
these
cycles
may
be
spoken
of
as
the
great
earth
periods
separated
from
each
other
by
some
great
natural
cataclysm
which
destroyed
the
works
of
the
previous
races
of
men
and
which
started
afresh
the
progress
called
civilization
which
as
all
students
know
manifests
a
rise
and
fall
like
unto
that
of
the
tides
man
in
the
first
cycle
emerged
from
a
gross
state
into
a
condition
somewhat
advanced
it
was
a
slow
progress
but
nevertheless
a
distinct
series
of
advances
were
made
by
the
more
progressive
souls
who
passed
over
on
to
the
second
cycle
embodying
themselves
as
the
ruling
races
in
the
same
their
less
progressive
brothers
incarnating
in
the
lower
tribes
of
the
second
cycle
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
souls
which
do
not
advance
during
a
cycle
reincarnate
in
the
next
cycle
among
the
lower
races
so
that
even
in
this
fifth
cycle
we
have
remnants
of
the
previous
cycles
the
lives
of
the
members
of
which
give
us
an
idea
of
what
life
in
the
earlier
cycles
must
have
been
the
yogi
teachings
give
us
but
little
information
regarding
the
people
of
the
first
and
second
cycles
because
of
the
low
state
of
these
ages
the
tale
if
told
would
be
the
story
of
the
and
people
the
and
all
the
rest
of
savage
barbarian
crew
there
was
but
little
trace
of
anything
like
that
which
we
call
civilization
although
in
the
latter
periods
of
the
second
cycle
the
foundations
for
the
coming
civilizations
were
firmly
laid
after
the
cataclysm
which
destroyed
the
works
of
man
of
the
second
cycle
and
left
the
survivors
scattered
or
disorganized
awaiting
the
touch
of
the
organizing
urge
which
followed
shortly
afterward
there
dawned
the
first
period
of
the
third
cycle
the
scene
of
the
life
of
the
third
cycle
was
laid
in
what
is
known
to
occultists
as
lemuria
lemuria
was
a
mighty
continent
situated
in
what
is
now
known
as
the
pacific
ocean
and
parts
of
the
indian
ocean
it
included
australia
australasia
and
other
portions
of
the
pacific
islands
which
are
in
fact
surviving
portions
of
the
great
continent
of
lemuria
its
highest
points
the
lower
portion
having
sunk
beneath
the
seas
ages
and
ages
ago
life
in
lemuria
is
described
as
being
principally
concerned
with
the
physical
senses
and
sensual
enjoyment
only
a
few
developed
souls
having
broken
through
the
fetters
of
materiality
and
reached
the
beginnings
of
the
mental
and
spiritual
planes
of
life
some
few
indeed
made
great
progress
and
were
saved
from
the
general
wreck
in
order
to
become
the
leaven
which
would
lighten
the
mass
of
mankind
during
the
next
cycle
these
developed
souls
were
the
teachers
of
the
new
races
and
were
looked
upon
by
the
latter
as
gods
and
supernatural
beings
and
legends
and
traditions
concerning
them
are
still
existent
among
the
ancient
peoples
of
our
present
day
many
of
the
myths
of
the
ancient
peoples
arose
in
this
way
the
yogi
traditions
hold
that
just
prior
to
the
great
cataclysm
which
destroyed
the
races
of
the
second
cycle
there
was
a
body
of
the
chosen
ones
which
migrated
from
lemuria
to
certain
islands
of
the
sea
which
are
now
part
of
the
main
land
of
india
these
people
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
occult
teachings
of
the
lemurians
and
developed
into
the
fount
of
truth
which
has
been
flowing
ever
since
throughout
the
successive
periods
and
cycles
when
lemuria
passed
away
there
arose
from
the
depths
of
the
ocean
the
continent
which
was
to
be
the
scene
of
the
life
and
civilization
of
the
fourth
cycle
the
continent
of
atlantis
atlantis
was
situated
in
a
portion
of
what
is
now
known
as
the
atlantic
ocean
beginning
at
what
is
now
known
as
the
caribbean
sea
and
extending
over
to
the
region
of
what
is
now
known
as
africa
what
are
now
known
as
cuba
and
the
west
indies
were
among
the
highest
points
of
the
continent
and
now
stand
like
monuments
to
its
departed
greatness
the
civilization
of
atlantis
was
remarkable
and
its
people
attained
heights
which
seem
almost
incredible
to
even
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
highest
achievements
of
man
in
our
own
times
the
chosen
ones
preserved
from
the
cataclysm
which
destroyed
lemuria
and
who
lived
to
a
remarkably
old
age
had
stored
up
within
their
minds
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
the
races
that
had
been
destroyed
and
they
thus
gave
the
atlanteans
an
enormous
they
soon
attained
great
advancement
along
all
the
lines
of
human
endeavor
they
perfected
mechanical
inventions
and
appliances
reaching
far
ahead
of
even
our
present
attainments
in
the
field
of
electricity
especially
they
reached
the
stages
that
our
present
races
will
reach
in
about
two
or
three
hundred
years
from
now
along
the
lines
of
occult
attainment
their
progress
was
far
beyond
the
dreams
of
the
average
man
of
our
own
race
and
in
fact
from
this
arose
one
of
the
causes
of
their
downfall
for
they
prostituted
the
power
to
base
and
selfish
uses
and
black
magic
and
so
the
decline
of
atlantis
began
but
the
end
did
not
come
at
once
or
suddenly
but
gradually
the
continent
and
its
surrounding
islands
gradually
sank
beneath
the
waves
of
the
atlantic
ocean
the
process
occupying
over
years
the
greeks
and
romans
of
our
own
cycle
had
traditions
regarding
the
sinking
of
the
continent
but
their
knowledge
referred
only
to
the
disappearance
of
the
small
remainder
certain
islands
the
continent
itself
having
disappeared
thousands
of
years
before
their
time
it
is
recorded
that
the
egyptian
priests
had
traditions
that
the
continent
itself
had
disappeared
nine
thousand
years
before
their
time
as
was
the
case
with
the
chosen
ones
of
lemuria
so
was
it
with
the
elect
of
atlantis
who
were
taken
away
from
the
doomed
land
some
time
prior
to
its
destruction
the
few
advanced
people
left
their
homes
and
migrated
to
portions
of
what
are
now
south
america
and
central
america
but
which
were
then
islands
of
the
sea
these
people
have
left
their
traces
of
their
civilization
and
works
which
our
antiquaries
are
discovering
when
the
fifth
cycle
dawned
our
own
cycle
remember
these
brave
and
advanced
souls
acted
as
the
and
became
as
gods
to
those
who
came
afterward
the
races
were
very
prolific
and
multiplied
very
rapidly
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
the
souls
of
the
atlanteans
were
pressing
forward
for
embodiment
and
human
forms
were
born
to
supply
the
demand
and
now
begins
the
history
of
our
own
cycle
the
fifth
cycle
but
before
we
begin
a
consideration
of
the
fifth
cycle
let
us
consider
for
a
moment
a
few
points
about
the
laws
operating
to
cause
these
great
changes
in
the
first
place
each
cycle
has
a
different
theatre
for
its
work
and
action
the
continent
of
lemuria
was
not
in
existence
during
the
second
cycle
and
arose
from
the
ocean
bed
only
when
its
appointed
time
came
and
likewise
the
continent
of
atlantis
reposed
beneath
the
waves
while
the
lemurian
races
manifested
during
the
third
cycle
rising
by
means
of
a
convulsion
of
the
earth
surface
to
play
its
part
during
its
own
period
the
fourth
cycle
only
to
sink
again
beneath
the
waves
to
make
way
for
the
birth
of
the
fifth
cycle
with
its
races
by
means
of
these
cataclysms
the
races
of
each
cycle
were
wiped
out
when
the
time
came
the
few
elect
or
chosen
ones
that
is
those
who
have
manifested
the
right
to
live
on
being
carried
away
to
some
favorable
environment
where
they
became
as
leaven
to
the
mass
as
gods
to
the
new
races
that
quickly
appear
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
these
chosen
ones
are
not
the
only
ones
saved
from
the
destruction
that
overtakes
the
majority
of
the
race
on
the
contrary
a
few
survivors
are
preserved
although
driven
away
from
their
former
homes
and
reduced
to
first
principles
of
living
in
order
to
become
the
parents
of
the
new
races
the
new
races
springing
from
the
fittest
of
these
survivors
quickly
form
being
composed
of
the
better
adapted
souls
seeking
reincarnation
while
the
less
fit
sink
into
barbarism
and
show
evidences
of
decay
although
a
remnant
drags
on
for
thousands
of
years
being
composed
of
the
souls
of
those
who
have
not
advanced
sufficiently
to
take
a
part
in
the
life
of
the
new
races
these
are
in
evidence
in
our
own
times
in
the
cases
of
the
australian
savages
and
some
of
the
african
tribes
as
well
as
among
the
digger
indians
and
others
of
similar
grade
of
intelligence
in
order
to
understand
the
advance
of
each
race
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
more
advanced
souls
after
passing
out
of
the
body
have
a
much
longer
period
of
rest
in
the
higher
planes
and
consequently
do
not
present
themselves
for
reincarnation
until
a
period
quite
late
when
compared
with
the
hasty
reincarnation
of
the
less
advanced
souls
who
are
hurried
back
to
rebirth
by
reason
of
the
strong
earthly
attachments
and
desires
in
this
way
it
happens
that
the
earlier
races
of
each
cycle
are
more
primitive
folk
than
those
who
follow
them
as
the
years
roll
by
the
soul
of
an
person
reincarnates
in
a
few
years
and
sometimes
in
a
few
days
while
the
soul
of
an
advanced
man
may
repose
and
rest
on
the
higher
planes
for
centuries
nay
even
for
thousands
of
years
until
the
earth
has
reached
a
stage
in
which
the
appropriate
environment
may
be
afforded
it
observers
unconnected
with
occultism
have
noted
certain
laws
which
seem
to
regulate
the
rise
and
fall
of
nations
the
procession
of
ruling
races
they
do
not
understand
the
law
of
metempsychosis
that
alone
gives
the
key
to
the
problem
but
nevertheless
they
have
not
failed
to
record
the
existence
of
the
laws
themselves
in
order
to
show
that
these
laws
are
recognized
by
persons
who
are
not
at
all
influenced
by
the
occult
teachings
we
take
the
liberty
of
quoting
from
history
of
the
intellectual
development
of
europe
draper
writes
as
follows
we
are
as
we
often
say
the
creatures
of
circumstances
in
that
expression
there
is
a
higher
philosophy
than
might
at
first
appear
from
this
more
accurate
point
of
view
we
should
therefore
consider
the
course
of
these
events
recognizing
the
principle
that
the
affairs
of
men
pass
forward
in
a
determinate
way
expanding
and
unfolding
themselves
and
hence
we
see
that
the
things
of
which
we
have
spoken
as
if
they
were
matters
of
choice
were
in
reality
forced
upon
their
apparent
authors
by
the
necessity
of
the
times
but
in
truth
they
should
be
considered
as
the
presentation
of
a
certain
phase
of
life
which
nations
in
their
onward
course
sooner
or
later
assume
to
the
individual
how
well
we
know
that
a
sober
moderation
of
action
an
appropriate
gravity
of
demeanor
belonging
to
the
mature
period
of
life
change
from
the
wanton
willfulness
of
youth
which
may
be
ushered
in
or
its
beginnings
marked
by
many
accidental
incidents
in
one
perhaps
by
domestic
bereavements
in
another
by
the
loss
of
fortune
in
a
third
by
we
are
correct
enough
in
imputing
to
such
trials
the
change
of
character
but
we
never
deceive
ourselves
by
supposing
that
it
would
have
failed
to
take
place
had
these
incidents
not
occurred
there
runs
an
irresistible
destiny
in
the
midst
of
these
vicissitudes
there
are
analogies
between
the
life
of
a
nation
and
that
of
an
individual
who
though
he
may
be
in
one
respect
the
maker
of
his
own
fortunes
for
happiness
or
for
misery
for
good
or
for
evil
though
he
remains
here
or
goes
there
as
his
inclinations
prompt
though
he
does
this
or
abstains
from
that
as
he
chooses
is
nevertheless
held
fast
by
an
inexorable
fate
a
fate
which
brought
him
into
the
world
involuntarily
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
which
presses
him
forward
through
a
definite
career
the
stages
of
which
are
absolutely
invariable
infancy
childhood
youth
maturity
old
age
with
all
their
characteristic
actions
and
passions
and
which
removes
him
from
the
scene
at
the
appointed
time
in
most
cases
against
his
will
so
also
is
it
with
nations
the
voluntary
is
only
the
outward
semblance
covering
but
hardly
hiding
the
predetermined
over
the
events
of
life
we
may
have
control
but
none
whatever
over
the
law
of
its
progress
there
is
a
geometry
that
applies
to
nations
an
equation
of
their
curve
of
advance
that
no
mortal
man
can
touch
this
remarkable
passage
just
quoted
shows
how
the
close
observers
of
history
note
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
tides
of
human
race
progress
although
ignorant
of
the
real
underlying
causing
energy
or
force
a
study
of
the
occult
teachings
alone
gives
one
the
hidden
secret
of
human
actions
and
throws
the
bright
light
of
truth
upon
the
dark
corners
of
phenomena
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
cycle
which
is
the
present
one
there
were
not
only
the
beginnings
of
the
new
races
which
always
spring
up
at
the
beginning
of
each
new
cycle
and
which
are
the
foundations
for
the
coming
races
which
take
advantage
of
the
fresh
conditions
and
opportunities
for
growth
and
development
but
there
were
also
the
descendants
of
the
elect
saved
from
the
destruction
of
atlantis
by
having
been
led
away
and
colonized
far
from
the
scene
of
danger
the
new
races
were
the
descendant
of
the
scattered
survivors
of
the
atlantean
peoples
that
is
the
common
run
of
people
of
the
time
but
the
elect
few
were
very
superior
people
and
imparted
to
their
descendants
their
knowledge
and
wisdom
so
that
we
see
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
cycle
hordes
of
new
primitive
people
in
certain
lands
and
in
other
places
advanced
nations
like
the
ancestors
of
the
ancient
egyptians
persians
chaldeans
hindus
etc
these
advanced
races
were
old
souls
advanced
souls
the
progressed
and
developed
souls
of
ancient
lemuria
and
atlantis
who
lived
their
lives
and
who
are
now
either
on
higher
planes
of
life
or
else
are
among
us
taking
a
leading
part
in
the
world
affairs
striving
mightily
to
save
the
present
races
from
the
misfortunes
which
overtook
their
predecessors
the
descendants
of
the
people
were
the
assyrians
and
babylonians
in
due
time
the
primitive
new
races
developed
and
the
great
roman
grecian
and
carthaginian
peoples
appeared
then
came
the
rise
of
other
peoples
and
nations
down
to
the
present
time
each
race
or
nation
has
its
rise
its
height
of
attainment
and
its
decline
when
a
nation
begins
to
decline
it
is
because
its
more
advanced
souls
have
passed
on
and
only
the
less
progressive
souls
are
left
the
history
of
all
nations
show
the
truth
of
the
occult
the
term
men
are
forsaking
old
ideals
creeds
and
dogmas
and
are
running
hither
and
thither
seeking
something
they
feel
to
be
necessary
but
of
the
nature
of
which
they
know
nothing
they
are
feeling
the
hunger
for
peace
the
thirst
for
knowledge
and
they
are
seeking
satisfaction
in
all
directions
this
is
not
only
the
inevitable
working
of
the
law
of
evolution
but
is
also
a
manifestation
of
the
power
and
love
of
the
great
souls
that
have
passed
on
to
higher
planes
of
existence
and
who
have
become
as
angels
and
these
beings
are
filled
with
the
love
of
the
race
and
are
setting
into
motion
influences
that
are
being
manifest
in
many
directions
the
tendency
of
which
are
to
bring
the
race
to
a
realization
of
its
higher
power
faculties
and
destiny
as
we
have
said
in
other
places
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
seeker
after
truth
in
his
consideration
of
the
question
of
spiritual
evolution
is
the
feeling
that
rebirth
is
being
forced
upon
him
without
any
say
on
his
part
and
against
his
desires
but
this
is
far
from
being
correct
it
is
true
that
the
whole
process
is
according
to
the
great
law
but
that
law
operates
through
the
force
of
desire
and
attraction
the
soul
is
attracted
toward
rebirth
by
reason
of
its
desire
or
rather
the
essence
of
its
desires
it
is
reborn
only
because
it
has
within
itself
the
desire
for
further
experience
and
opportunity
for
unfoldment
and
it
is
reborn
into
certain
environments
solely
because
it
has
within
itself
unsatisfied
desires
for
those
environments
etc
the
process
is
just
as
regular
and
scientific
as
is
the
attraction
of
one
atom
of
matter
for
another
each
soul
has
within
itself
certain
elements
of
desire
and
attraction
and
it
attracts
to
itself
certain
conditions
and
experiences
and
is
in
turn
attracted
by
these
things
this
is
the
law
of
life
in
the
body
and
out
of
it
and
there
is
no
injustice
in
the
law
it
is
the
essence
of
justice
itself
for
it
gives
to
each
just
what
is
required
to
fill
the
indwelling
desires
or
else
the
conditions
and
experiences
designed
to
burn
out
the
desires
which
are
holding
one
back
and
the
destruction
of
which
will
make
possible
future
advancement
for
instance
if
one
is
bound
by
the
inordinate
desire
for
material
wealth
the
law
of
karma
will
attract
him
to
a
rebirth
in
conditions
in
which
he
will
be
surrounded
by
wealth
and
luxury
until
he
becomes
sickened
with
them
and
will
find
his
heart
filled
with
the
desire
to
flee
from
them
and
toward
higher
and
more
satisfying
things
of
course
the
law
of
karma
acts
in
other
ways
as
we
shall
see
in
our
next
lesson
it
deals
with
one
debts
and
obligations
also
the
law
of
karma
is
closely
connected
with
metempsychosis
and
one
must
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
other
always
not
only
is
it
true
that
man
rebirths
are
in
strict
accordance
with
the
law
of
attraction
and
desire
but
it
is
also
true
that
after
he
attains
a
certain
stage
of
spiritual
unfoldment
he
enters
into
the
conscious
stage
of
rebirth
and
thereafter
he
is
reborn
consciously
and
with
full
foreknowledge
many
are
now
entering
into
this
stage
of
development
and
have
a
partial
consciousness
of
their
past
lives
which
also
implies
that
they
have
had
at
least
a
partial
consciousness
of
approaching
rebirth
for
the
two
phases
of
consciousness
run
together
those
individuals
of
a
race
who
have
outstripped
their
fellows
in
spiritual
unfoldment
are
still
bound
by
the
karma
of
the
particular
race
to
which
they
belong
up
to
a
certain
point
and
as
the
entire
race
or
at
least
a
large
proportion
of
it
must
move
forward
as
a
whole
such
individuals
must
needs
wait
also
but
they
are
not
compelled
to
suffer
a
tiresome
round
of
continued
rebirths
amid
environments
and
conditions
which
they
have
outgrown
on
the
contrary
the
advanced
individual
soul
is
allowed
to
wait
until
the
race
reaches
its
own
stage
of
advancement
when
it
again
joins
in
the
upward
movement
in
full
consciousness
however
in
the
interim
he
may
pass
his
well
earned
rest
either
on
some
of
the
higher
planes
of
rest
or
else
in
conscious
temporary
sojourn
in
other
material
spheres
helping
in
the
great
work
as
a
teacher
and
worker
for
good
and
spiritual
evolution
among
those
who
need
such
help
in
fact
there
are
in
the
world
individual
souls
which
have
reached
similar
stages
on
other
planets
and
who
are
spending
their
rest
period
here
amidst
the
comparatively
lower
earth
conditions
striving
to
lift
up
the
earth
souls
to
greater
heights
so
long
as
people
allow
themselves
to
become
attached
to
material
objects
so
long
will
they
be
reborn
in
conditions
in
which
these
objects
bind
them
fast
it
is
only
when
the
soul
frees
itself
from
these
entangling
obstructions
that
it
is
born
in
conditions
of
freedom
some
outgrow
these
material
attachments
by
right
thinking
and
reasoning
while
others
seem
to
be
compelled
to
live
them
out
and
thus
outlive
them
before
they
are
free
at
last
when
the
soul
realizes
that
these
things
are
merely
incidents
of
the
lower
personality
and
have
naught
to
do
with
the
real
individuality
then
and
then
only
do
they
fall
from
it
like
a
wornout
cloak
and
are
left
behind
while
it
bounds
forward
on
the
path
fresh
from
the
lighter
weight
being
carried
the
yogi
philosophy
teaches
that
man
will
live
forever
ascending
from
higher
to
higher
planes
and
then
on
and
on
and
on
death
is
but
the
physical
symbol
of
a
period
of
soul
rest
similar
to
sleep
of
the
tired
body
and
is
just
as
much
to
be
welcomed
and
greeted
with
thanks
life
is
continuous
and
its
object
is
development
unfoldment
and
growth
we
are
in
eternity
now
as
much
as
we
ever
shall
be
our
souls
may
exist
out
of
the
body
as
well
as
in
it
although
bodily
incarnation
is
necessary
at
this
stage
of
our
development
as
we
progress
on
to
higher
planes
of
life
we
shall
incarnate
in
bodies
far
more
ethereal
than
those
now
used
by
us
just
as
in
the
past
we
used
bodies
almost
incredibly
grosser
and
coarser
than
those
we
call
our
own
life
is
far
more
than
a
thing
of
and
ten
years
it
is
really
a
succession
of
such
lives
on
an
ascending
scale
that
which
we
call
our
personal
self
being
merely
the
essence
of
the
experiences
of
countless
lives
in
the
past
the
soul
is
working
steadily
upward
from
higher
to
higher
from
gross
to
finer
forms
and
manifestations
and
it
will
steadily
work
for
ages
to
come
always
progressing
always
advancing
always
unfolding
the
universe
contains
many
worlds
for
the
soul
to
inhabit
and
then
after
it
has
passed
on
to
other
universes
there
will
still
be
infinitude
before
it
the
destiny
of
the
soul
of
man
is
of
wondrous
promise
and
possibilities
the
mind
can
not
begin
to
even
dream
of
what
is
before
the
soul
those
who
have
already
advanced
many
steps
beyond
you
those
elder
brethren
are
constantly
extending
to
you
aid
in
many
directions
they
are
extending
to
you
the
unseen
hand
which
lifts
you
over
many
a
hard
place
and
dangerous
crossing
but
you
recognize
it
not
except
in
a
vague
way
there
are
now
in
existence
on
planes
infinitely
higher
than
your
own
intelligences
of
transcendent
glory
and
magnificence
but
they
were
once
men
even
as
you
are
they
have
so
far
progressed
upon
the
path
that
they
have
become
as
angels
and
archangels
when
compared
with
you
and
blessed
thought
even
as
these
exalted
ones
were
once
even
as
you
so
shall
you
in
due
course
of
spiritual
evolution
become
even
as
these
mighty
ones
the
yogi
philosophy
teaches
that
you
who
are
reading
these
lines
have
lived
many
lives
previous
to
the
present
one
you
have
lived
in
the
lower
forms
and
have
worked
your
way
arduously
along
the
path
until
now
you
are
reaching
the
stage
of
spiritual
consciousness
in
which
the
past
and
future
will
begin
to
appear
plain
to
you
for
the
first
time
you
have
lived
as
the
the
the
savage
the
barbarian
you
have
been
the
warrior
the
priest
the
medieval
scholar
and
occultist
the
prince
the
pauper
you
have
lived
in
lemuria
in
atlantis
in
india
in
persia
in
egypt
in
ancient
rome
and
greece
and
are
now
playing
your
part
in
the
western
civilization
associating
with
many
with
whom
you
have
had
relations
in
your
past
lives
in
closing
this
lesson
let
us
quote
from
a
previous
writing
from
the
same
pen
that
writes
this
lesson
toward
what
goal
is
all
this
spiritual
evolution
tending
what
does
it
all
mean
from
the
low
planes
of
life
to
the
highest
all
are
on
the
path
to
what
state
or
place
does
the
path
lead
let
us
attempt
to
answer
by
asking
you
to
imagine
a
series
of
millions
of
circles
one
within
the
other
each
circle
means
a
stage
of
life
the
outer
circles
are
filled
with
life
in
its
lowest
and
most
material
stages
each
circle
nearer
the
centre
holds
higher
and
higher
forms
until
men
or
what
were
once
men
become
as
gods
still
on
and
on
and
on
does
the
form
of
life
grow
higher
until
the
human
mind
can
not
grasp
the
idea
but
what
is
the
centre
the
mind
of
the
entire
spiritual
body
the
absolute
and
we
are
traveling
toward
that
centre
and
again
from
the
same
source
but
beyond
your
plane
and
beyond
mine
are
plane
after
plane
connected
with
our
earth
the
splendors
of
which
man
can
not
conceive
and
there
are
likewise
many
planes
around
the
other
planets
of
our
chain
and
there
are
millions
of
other
worlds
and
there
are
chains
of
universes
just
as
there
are
chains
of
planets
and
then
greater
groups
of
these
chains
and
so
on
greater
and
grander
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
imagine
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
higher
and
higher
to
inconceivable
heights
an
infinity
of
infinities
of
worlds
are
before
us
our
world
and
our
planetary
system
and
our
system
of
suns
and
our
system
of
solar
systems
are
but
as
grains
of
sand
on
the
beach
of
the
mighty
ocean
but
then
you
cry
what
am
i
poor
mortal
thing
lost
among
all
this
inconceivable
greatness
the
answer
comes
that
you
are
that
most
precious
thing
a
living
soul
and
if
you
were
destroyed
the
whole
system
of
universes
would
crumble
for
you
are
as
necessary
as
the
greatest
part
of
it
it
can
not
do
without
you
you
can
not
be
lost
or
destroyed
you
are
a
part
of
it
all
and
are
eternal
you
ask
all
of
this
of
which
you
have
told
me
what
is
there
what
is
the
centre
of
it
all
your
teacher
face
takes
on
a
rapt
expression
a
light
not
of
earth
beams
forth
from
his
countenance
he
replies
the
eleventh
lesson
the
law
of
karma
karma
is
a
sanscrit
term
for
that
great
law
known
to
western
thinkers
as
spiritual
cause
and
effect
or
causation
it
relates
to
the
complicated
affinities
for
either
good
or
evil
that
have
been
acquired
by
the
soul
throughout
its
many
incarnations
these
affinities
manifest
as
characteristics
enduring
from
one
incarnation
to
another
being
added
to
here
softened
or
altered
there
but
always
pressing
forward
for
expression
and
manifestation
and
so
it
follows
that
what
each
one
of
us
is
in
this
life
depends
upon
is
what
we
have
been
and
how
we
have
acted
in
our
past
lives
throughout
the
operations
of
the
law
of
karma
the
manifestation
of
perfect
justice
is
apparent
we
are
not
punished
our
sins
as
the
current
beliefs
have
it
but
instead
we
are
punished
our
sins
we
are
not
rewarded
our
good
acts
but
we
received
our
reward
and
characteristics
qualities
affinities
acquired
by
reason
of
our
having
performed
these
good
acts
in
previous
lives
we
are
our
own
judges
and
executioners
in
our
present
lives
we
are
storing
up
good
or
bad
karma
which
will
stick
to
us
closely
and
which
will
demand
expression
and
manifestation
in
lives
to
come
when
we
fasten
around
ourselves
the
evil
of
bad
karma
we
have
taken
to
shelter
a
monster
which
will
gnaw
into
our
very
vitals
until
we
shake
him
off
by
developing
opposite
qualities
and
when
we
draw
to
ourselves
the
good
karma
of
duty
well
performed
kindness
well
expressed
and
good
deeds
freely
performed
without
hope
of
reward
then
do
we
weave
for
ourselves
the
beautiful
garments
which
we
are
destined
to
wear
upon
the
occasion
of
our
future
lives
the
yogi
teachings
relating
to
the
law
of
karma
do
not
teach
us
that
sin
is
an
offense
against
the
power
which
brought
us
into
being
so
much
as
it
is
an
offense
against
ourselves
we
can
not
injure
the
absolute
nor
harm
it
in
any
way
but
we
may
harm
each
other
and
in
so
doing
harm
ourselves
the
yogis
teach
that
sin
is
largely
a
matter
of
ignorance
and
misunderstanding
of
our
true
nature
and
that
the
lesson
must
be
well
learned
until
we
are
able
to
see
the
folly
and
error
of
our
former
course
and
thus
are
able
to
remedy
our
past
errors
and
to
avoid
their
recurrence
by
karma
the
effects
arising
from
our
sins
cling
to
us
until
we
become
sick
and
weary
of
them
and
seek
their
cause
in
our
hearts
when
we
have
discovered
the
evil
cause
of
these
effects
we
learn
to
hate
it
and
tear
it
from
us
as
a
foul
thing
and
are
thence
evermore
relieved
of
it
the
yogis
view
the
sinning
soul
as
the
parent
does
the
child
who
will
persist
in
playing
with
forbidden
things
the
parent
cautions
the
child
against
playing
with
the
stove
but
still
the
child
persists
in
its
disobedience
and
sooner
or
later
receives
a
burn
for
its
meddling
the
burn
is
not
a
for
the
disobedience
although
it
may
seem
so
to
it
but
comes
in
obedience
to
a
natural
law
which
is
invariable
to
child
finds
out
that
stoves
and
burns
are
connected
and
begins
to
see
some
sense
and
reason
in
the
admonitions
of
the
parent
the
love
of
the
parent
sought
to
save
the
child
the
pain
of
the
burn
and
yet
the
persisted
in
experimenting
and
was
taught
the
lesson
but
the
lesson
once
thoroughly
learned
it
is
not
necessary
to
forbid
the
child
the
stove
for
it
has
learned
the
danger
for
itself
and
thereafter
avoids
it
and
thus
it
is
with
the
human
soul
passing
on
from
one
life
to
another
it
learns
new
lessons
gathers
new
experiences
and
learns
to
recognize
the
pain
that
invariably
comes
from
wrong
action
and
the
happiness
that
invariably
comes
from
right
action
as
it
progresses
it
learns
how
hurtful
certain
courses
of
action
are
and
like
the
burnt
child
it
avoids
them
thereafter
if
we
will
but
stop
to
consider
for
a
moment
the
relative
degrees
of
temptation
to
us
and
to
others
we
may
see
the
operations
of
past
karma
in
former
lives
why
is
it
that
this
thing
is
no
temptation
to
you
while
it
is
the
greatest
temptation
to
another
why
is
it
that
certain
things
do
not
seem
to
have
any
attraction
for
him
and
yet
they
attract
you
so
much
that
you
have
to
use
all
of
your
will
power
to
resist
them
it
is
because
of
the
karma
in
your
past
lives
the
things
that
do
not
now
tempt
you
have
been
outlived
in
some
former
life
and
you
have
profited
by
your
own
experiences
or
those
of
others
or
else
through
some
teaching
given
you
by
one
who
had
been
attracted
to
you
by
your
unfolding
consciousness
of
truth
we
are
profiting
by
the
lessons
of
our
past
lives
if
we
have
learned
them
well
we
are
receiving
the
benefit
while
if
we
have
turned
our
backs
on
the
words
of
wisdom
offered
us
or
have
refused
to
learn
the
lesson
perfectly
we
are
compelled
to
sit
on
the
same
old
and
hear
the
same
old
lesson
repeated
until
it
is
fairly
driven
into
our
consciousness
we
wonder
why
it
is
that
other
persons
can
perform
certain
evil
acts
that
seem
so
repulsive
to
us
and
are
apt
to
pride
ourselves
upon
our
superior
virtue
but
those
who
know
realize
that
their
unfortunate
brethren
have
not
paid
sufficient
attention
to
the
lesson
of
the
past
and
are
having
it
repeated
to
them
in
a
more
drastic
form
this
time
they
know
that
the
virtuous
ones
are
simply
reaping
the
benefit
of
their
own
application
in
the
past
but
that
their
lesson
is
not
over
and
that
unless
they
advance
and
hold
fast
to
that
which
they
have
attained
as
well
they
will
be
outstripped
by
many
of
those
whose
failure
they
are
now
viewing
with
wonder
and
scorn
it
is
hard
for
us
to
fully
realize
that
we
are
what
we
are
because
of
our
past
experiences
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
value
the
experiences
that
we
are
now
going
through
because
we
do
not
fully
appreciate
the
value
of
bitter
experiences
once
lived
out
and
outlived
let
us
look
back
over
the
experiences
of
this
present
life
for
instance
how
many
bitter
episodes
are
there
which
we
wish
had
never
happened
and
how
we
wish
we
could
tear
them
out
of
our
consciousness
but
we
do
not
realize
that
from
these
same
bitter
experiences
came
knowledge
and
wisdom
that
we
would
not
part
with
under
any
circumstances
and
yet
if
we
were
to
tear
away
from
us
the
cause
of
these
benefits
we
would
tear
away
the
benefits
also
and
would
find
ourselves
back
just
where
we
were
before
the
experience
happened
to
us
what
we
would
like
to
do
is
to
hold
on
to
the
benefits
that
came
from
the
experience
knowledge
and
wisdom
that
were
picked
from
the
tree
of
pain
but
we
can
not
separate
the
effect
from
the
cause
in
this
way
and
must
learn
to
look
back
upon
these
bitter
experiences
as
the
causes
from
which
our
present
knowledge
wisdom
and
attainment
proceeded
then
may
we
cease
to
hate
these
things
and
to
see
that
good
may
come
from
evil
under
the
workings
of
the
law
and
when
we
are
able
to
do
this
we
shall
be
able
to
regard
the
painful
experiences
of
our
present
day
as
the
inevitable
outcome
of
causes
away
back
in
our
past
but
which
will
work
surely
toward
increased
knowledge
wisdom
and
attainment
if
we
will
but
see
the
good
underlying
the
working
of
the
law
when
we
fall
in
with
the
working
of
the
law
of
karma
we
recognize
its
pain
not
as
an
injustice
or
punishment
but
as
the
beneficent
operation
of
a
law
which
although
apparently
working
evil
has
for
its
end
and
aim
ultimate
good
many
object
to
the
teachings
of
the
law
of
karma
by
saying
that
the
experiences
of
each
life
not
being
remembered
must
be
useless
and
without
value
this
is
a
very
foolish
position
to
take
concerning
the
matter
these
experiences
although
not
fully
remembered
are
not
lost
to
us
at
all
they
are
made
a
part
of
the
material
of
which
our
minds
are
composed
they
exist
in
the
form
of
feelings
characteristics
inclinations
likes
and
dislikes
affinities
attractions
repulsions
and
are
as
much
in
evidence
as
are
the
experiences
of
yesterday
which
are
fresh
in
our
memory
look
back
over
your
present
life
and
try
to
remember
the
experiences
of
the
past
years
you
will
find
that
you
remember
but
few
of
the
events
of
your
life
the
pressing
and
constant
experiences
of
each
of
the
days
that
you
have
lived
have
been
for
the
most
part
forgotten
though
these
experiences
may
have
seemed
very
vivid
and
real
to
you
when
they
occurred
still
they
have
faded
into
nothingness
now
and
they
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
to
you
but
they
lost
not
at
all
you
are
what
you
are
because
of
the
results
of
these
experiences
your
character
has
been
moulded
and
shaped
little
by
little
by
these
apparently
forgotten
pains
pleasures
sorrows
and
happinesses
this
trial
strengthened
you
along
certain
lines
that
one
changed
your
point
of
view
and
made
you
see
things
with
a
broader
sweep
of
vision
this
grief
caused
you
to
feel
the
pain
of
others
that
disappointment
spurred
you
on
to
new
endeavors
and
each
and
every
one
of
them
left
a
permanent
mark
upon
your
personality
upon
your
character
all
men
are
what
they
are
by
reason
of
what
they
have
lived
through
and
out
and
though
these
happenings
scenes
circumstances
occurrences
experiences
have
faded
from
the
memory
their
effects
are
indelibly
imprinted
upon
the
fabric
of
the
character
and
the
man
of
is
different
from
what
he
would
have
been
had
the
happening
or
experience
not
entered
into
his
life
and
this
same
rule
applies
to
the
characteristics
brought
over
from
past
incarnations
you
have
not
the
memory
of
the
experiences
but
you
have
the
fruit
in
the
shape
of
characteristics
tastes
inclinations
etc
you
have
a
tendency
toward
certain
things
and
a
distaste
for
others
certain
things
attract
while
others
repel
you
all
of
these
things
are
the
result
of
your
experiences
in
former
incarnations
your
very
taste
and
inclination
toward
occult
studies
which
has
caused
you
to
read
these
lessons
is
your
legacy
from
some
former
life
in
which
some
one
spoke
a
word
or
two
to
you
regarding
the
subject
and
attracted
your
interest
and
desire
you
learned
some
little
about
the
subject
then
perhaps
much
and
developed
a
desire
for
more
knowledge
along
these
lines
which
manifesting
in
your
present
life
has
brought
you
in
contact
with
further
instruction
the
same
inclination
will
lead
to
further
advancement
in
this
life
and
still
greater
opportunities
in
future
incarnations
nearly
every
one
who
reads
these
lines
has
felt
that
much
of
this
occult
instruction
imparted
is
but
a
of
something
previously
known
although
many
of
the
things
taught
have
never
been
heard
before
in
this
life
you
pick
up
a
book
and
read
something
and
know
at
once
that
it
is
so
because
in
some
vague
way
you
have
a
consciousness
of
having
studied
and
worked
out
the
problem
in
some
past
period
of
your
lives
all
this
is
the
working
of
the
law
of
karma
which
caused
you
to
attract
that
for
which
you
have
an
affinity
and
which
also
causes
others
to
be
attracted
to
you
many
are
the
reunions
of
people
who
have
been
related
to
each
other
in
previous
lives
the
old
loves
and
old
hates
work
out
their
karmic
results
in
our
lives
we
are
bound
to
those
whom
we
have
loved
and
also
to
those
whom
we
may
have
injured
the
story
must
be
worked
out
to
the
end
although
a
knowledge
of
the
law
undoubtedly
relieves
one
of
many
entangling
attachments
and
karmic
relationships
by
pointing
out
the
nature
of
the
relation
and
enabling
one
to
free
himself
mentally
from
the
bond
which
process
tends
to
dissolve
much
of
the
karmic
entanglements
life
is
a
great
school
for
the
learning
of
lessons
it
has
many
grades
many
classes
many
scales
of
progress
and
the
lessons
must
be
learned
whether
we
will
or
no
if
we
refuse
or
neglect
to
learn
the
lesson
we
are
sent
back
to
accomplish
the
task
again
and
again
until
the
lesson
is
finally
learned
nothing
once
learned
is
ever
forgotten
entirely
there
is
an
indelible
imprint
of
the
lesson
in
our
character
which
manifests
as
predispositions
tastes
inclinations
etc
all
that
goes
to
make
up
that
which
we
call
character
is
the
workings
of
the
law
of
karma
there
is
no
such
thing
as
chance
nothing
ever
happens
all
is
regulated
by
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
or
karma
as
a
man
sows
so
shall
he
reap
in
a
literal
sense
you
are
what
you
are
by
reason
of
what
you
were
in
your
last
life
and
in
your
next
life
you
will
be
what
you
are
making
of
yourself
you
are
your
own
judge
and
executioner
your
own
bestower
of
rewards
but
the
love
of
the
absolute
is
ever
working
to
lead
you
upward
to
the
light
and
to
open
your
soul
to
that
knowledge
that
in
the
words
of
the
yogis
burns
up
karma
and
enables
you
to
throw
off
the
burden
of
cause
and
effect
that
you
have
been
carrying
around
with
you
and
which
has
weighted
you
down
in
the
fourteen
lessons
we
quoted
from
berry
benson
a
writer
in
the
for
may
the
quotation
fits
so
beautifully
into
this
place
that
we
venture
to
reproduce
it
here
once
more
with
your
permission
it
reads
as
follows
a
little
boy
went
to
school
he
was
very
little
all
that
he
knew
he
had
drawn
in
with
his
mother
milk
his
teacher
who
was
god
placed
him
in
the
lowest
class
and
gave
him
these
lessons
to
learn
thou
shalt
not
kill
thou
shalt
do
no
hurt
to
any
living
thing
thou
shalt
not
steal
so
the
man
did
not
kill
but
he
was
cruel
and
he
stole
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
his
beard
was
gray
when
the
night
was
come
his
teacher
who
was
god
said
thou
hast
learned
not
to
kill
but
the
other
lessons
thou
hast
not
learned
come
back
tomorrow
on
the
morrow
he
came
back
a
little
boy
and
his
teacher
who
was
god
put
him
in
a
class
a
little
higher
and
gave
him
these
lessons
to
learn
thou
shalt
do
no
hurt
to
any
living
thing
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
cheat
so
the
man
did
no
hurt
to
any
living
thing
but
he
stole
and
cheated
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
his
beard
was
gray
when
the
night
was
come
his
teacher
who
was
god
said
thou
hast
learned
to
be
merciful
but
the
other
lessons
thou
hast
not
learned
come
back
tomorrow
again
on
the
morrow
he
came
back
a
little
boy
and
his
teacher
who
was
god
put
him
in
a
class
yet
a
little
higher
and
gave
him
these
lessons
to
learn
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
cheat
thou
shalt
not
covet
so
the
man
did
not
steal
but
he
cheated
and
he
coveted
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
his
beard
was
gray
when
the
night
was
come
his
teacher
who
was
god
said
thou
hast
learned
not
to
steal
but
the
other
lessons
thou
hast
not
learned
come
back
my
child
tomorrow
this
is
what
i
have
read
in
the
faces
of
men
and
women
in
the
book
of
the
world
and
in
the
scroll
of
the
heavens
which
is
writ
with
stars
under
the
operation
of
the
law
of
karma
every
man
is
master
of
his
own
destiny
he
rewards
himself
he
punishes
himself
he
builds
tears
down
and
develops
his
character
always
however
under
the
brooding
influence
of
the
absolute
which
is
love
infinite
and
which
is
constantly
exerting
the
upward
spiritual
urge
which
is
drawing
the
soul
toward
its
ultimate
haven
of
rest
man
must
and
does
work
out
his
own
salvation
and
destiny
but
the
upward
urge
is
always
there
never
tiring
never
despairing
knowing
always
that
ultimate
victory
belongs
to
the
soul
under
the
law
of
karma
every
action
yea
every
thought
as
well
has
its
karmic
effect
upon
the
future
incarnations
of
the
soul
and
not
exactly
in
the
nature
of
punishment
or
rewards
in
the
general
acceptation
of
the
term
but
as
the
invariable
operation
of
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
the
thoughts
of
a
person
are
like
seeds
which
seek
to
press
forward
into
growth
bud
blossom
and
fruit
some
spring
into
growth
in
this
life
while
others
are
carried
over
into
future
lives
the
actions
of
this
life
may
represent
only
the
partial
growth
of
the
thought
seed
and
future
lives
may
be
necessary
for
its
full
blossoming
and
fruition
of
course
the
individual
who
understands
the
truth
and
who
has
mentally
divorced
himself
from
the
fruits
of
his
actions
who
has
robbed
material
desire
of
its
vital
force
by
seeing
it
as
it
is
and
not
as
a
part
of
his
real
self
his
do
not
spring
into
blossom
and
fruit
in
future
lives
for
he
has
killed
their
germ
the
yogis
express
this
thought
by
the
illustration
of
the
they
show
their
pupils
that
while
ordinary
seeds
sprout
blossom
and
bear
fruit
still
if
one
bakes
the
seeds
their
vitality
is
gone
and
while
they
may
serve
the
purposes
of
a
nourishing
meal
still
they
can
never
cause
sprout
blossom
or
fruit
then
the
pupil
is
instructed
in
the
nature
of
desire
and
shown
how
desires
invariably
spring
into
plant
blossom
and
fruit
the
life
of
the
person
being
the
soil
in
which
they
flourish
but
desires
understood
and
set
off
from
the
real
man
are
akin
to
they
have
been
subjected
to
the
heat
of
spiritual
wisdom
and
are
thus
robbed
of
their
vitality
and
are
unable
to
bear
fruit
in
this
way
the
understood
and
mastered
desire
bears
no
karmic
fruit
of
future
action
the
yogis
teach
that
there
are
two
great
principles
at
work
in
the
matter
of
karmic
law
affecting
the
conditions
of
rebirth
the
first
principle
is
that
whereby
the
prevailing
desires
aspirations
likes
and
dislikes
loves
and
hates
attractions
and
repulsions
press
the
soul
into
conditions
in
which
these
characteristics
may
have
a
favorable
and
congenial
soil
for
development
the
second
principle
is
that
which
may
be
spoken
of
as
the
urge
of
the
unfolding
spirit
which
is
always
urging
forward
toward
fuller
expression
and
the
breaking
down
of
confining
sheaths
and
which
thus
exerts
a
pressure
upon
the
soul
awaiting
reincarnation
which
causes
it
to
seek
higher
environments
and
conditions
than
its
desires
and
aspiration
as
well
as
its
general
characteristics
would
demand
these
two
apparently
conflicting
and
yet
actually
harmonious
principles
acting
and
reacting
upon
each
other
determine
the
conditions
of
rebirth
and
have
a
very
material
effect
upon
the
karmic
law
one
life
is
largely
a
conflict
between
these
two
forces
the
one
tending
to
hold
the
soul
to
the
present
conditions
resulting
from
past
lives
and
the
other
ever
at
work
seeking
to
uplift
and
elevate
it
to
greater
heights
the
desires
and
characteristics
brought
over
from
the
past
lives
of
course
seek
fuller
expression
and
manifestation
upon
the
lines
of
the
past
lives
these
tendencies
simply
wish
to
be
let
alone
and
to
grow
according
to
their
own
laws
of
development
and
manifestation
but
the
unfolding
spirit
knowing
that
the
soul
best
interests
are
along
the
lines
of
spiritual
unfoldment
and
growth
brings
a
steady
pressure
to
bear
life
after
life
upon
the
soul
causing
it
to
gradually
kill
out
the
lower
desires
and
characteristics
and
to
develop
qualities
which
tend
to
lead
it
upward
instead
of
allowing
it
to
remain
on
its
present
level
there
to
bring
to
blossom
and
fruit
many
low
thoughts
and
desires
absolute
justice
reigns
over
the
operations
of
the
law
of
karma
but
back
of
that
and
superior
even
to
its
might
is
found
the
infinite
love
of
the
absolute
which
tends
to
redeem
the
race
it
is
that
love
that
is
back
of
all
the
upward
tendencies
of
the
soul
and
which
we
all
feel
within
our
inner
selves
in
our
best
moments
the
light
of
the
spirit
love
is
ever
there
our
relationship
to
others
in
past
lives
has
its
effect
upon
the
working
of
the
law
of
karma
if
in
the
past
we
have
formed
attachments
for
other
individuals
either
through
love
or
hate
either
by
kindness
or
cruelty
these
attachments
manifest
in
our
present
life
for
these
persons
are
bound
to
us
and
we
to
them
by
the
bonds
of
karma
until
the
attachment
is
worn
out
such
people
will
in
the
present
life
have
certain
relationships
to
us
the
object
of
which
is
the
working
out
of
the
problems
in
which
we
are
mutually
concerned
the
adjustment
of
relationship
the
squaring
up
of
accounts
the
development
of
both
we
are
apt
to
be
placed
in
a
position
to
receive
hurts
from
those
whom
we
have
hurt
in
past
lives
and
this
not
through
the
idea
of
revenge
but
by
the
inexorable
working
out
of
the
law
of
compensation
in
karmic
adjustments
and
when
we
are
helped
comforted
and
receive
favors
from
those
who
we
helped
in
past
lives
it
is
not
merely
a
reward
but
the
operation
of
the
same
law
of
justice
the
person
who
hurts
us
in
this
way
may
have
no
desire
to
do
so
and
may
even
be
distressed
because
he
is
used
as
an
instrument
in
this
way
but
the
karmic
law
places
him
in
a
position
where
he
unwittingly
and
without
desire
acts
so
that
you
receive
pain
through
him
have
you
not
felt
yourselves
hurting
another
although
you
had
no
desire
and
intention
of
so
doing
and
in
fact
were
sorely
distressed
because
you
could
not
prevent
the
pain
this
is
the
operation
of
karma
have
you
not
found
yourself
placed
where
you
unexpectedly
were
made
the
bestower
of
favors
upon
some
almost
unknown
persons
this
is
karma
the
wheel
turns
slowly
but
it
makes
the
complete
circle
karma
is
the
companion
law
to
metempsychosis
the
two
are
inextricably
connected
and
their
operations
are
closely
interwoven
constant
and
unvarying
in
operation
karma
manifests
upon
and
in
worlds
planets
races
nations
families
and
persons
everywhere
in
space
is
the
great
law
in
operation
in
some
form
the
mechanical
operations
called
causation
are
as
much
a
phase
of
karma
as
is
the
highest
phases
manifest
on
the
higher
planes
of
life
far
beyond
our
own
and
through
it
all
is
ever
the
urge
toward
perfection
the
upward
movement
of
all
life
the
yogi
teachings
regard
the
universe
as
a
mighty
whole
and
the
law
of
karma
as
the
one
great
law
operating
and
manifesting
through
that
whole
how
different
is
the
workings
of
this
mighty
law
from
the
many
ideas
advanced
by
man
to
account
for
the
happenings
of
life
mere
chance
is
no
explanation
for
the
careful
thinker
must
inevitably
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
an
universe
governed
by
law
there
can
be
no
room
for
chance
and
to
suppose
that
all
rewards
and
punishments
are
bestowed
by
a
personal
deity
in
answer
to
prayers
supplications
good
behavior
offerings
is
to
fall
back
into
the
childhood
stage
of
the
race
thought
the
yogis
teach
that
the
sorrow
suffering
and
affliction
witnessed
on
all
sides
of
us
as
well
as
the
joy
happiness
and
blessings
also
in
evidence
are
not
caused
by
the
will
or
whim
of
some
capricious
deity
to
reward
his
friends
and
punish
his
enemies
but
by
the
working
of
an
invariable
law
which
metes
out
to
each
his
measure
of
good
and
ill
according
to
his
karmic
attachments
and
relationships
those
who
are
suffering
and
who
see
no
cause
for
their
pain
are
apt
to
complain
and
rebel
when
they
see
others
of
no
apparent
merit
enjoying
the
good
things
of
life
which
have
been
denied
their
apparently
more
worthy
brethren
the
churches
have
no
answer
except
it
is
god
will
and
that
the
divine
motive
must
not
be
questioned
these
answers
seem
like
mockery
particularly
when
the
idea
of
divine
justice
is
associated
with
the
teaching
there
is
no
other
answer
compatible
with
divine
justice
other
than
the
law
of
karma
which
makes
each
person
responsible
for
his
or
her
happiness
or
misery
and
there
is
nothing
so
stimulating
to
one
as
to
know
that
he
has
within
himself
the
means
to
create
for
himself
newer
and
better
conditions
of
life
and
environment
we
are
what
we
are
by
reason
of
what
we
were
in
our
yesterdays
we
will
be
in
our
tomorrows
that
which
we
have
started
into
operation
as
we
sow
in
this
life
so
shall
we
reap
in
the
next
we
are
now
reaping
that
which
we
have
sown
in
the
past
paul
voiced
a
world
truth
when
he
said
brethren
be
not
deceived
god
is
not
mocked
for
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
the
teachers
divide
the
operation
of
karma
into
three
general
classes
as
follows
the
karmic
manifestations
which
are
now
under
way
in
our
lives
producing
results
which
are
the
effects
of
causes
set
into
motion
in
our
past
lives
this
is
the
most
common
form
and
best
known
phase
of
karmic
manifestation
the
karma
which
we
are
now
acquiring
and
storing
up
by
reason
of
our
actions
deeds
thoughts
and
mental
and
spiritual
relationships
this
stored
up
karma
will
spring
into
operation
in
future
lives
when
the
body
and
environments
appropriate
for
its
manifestation
presents
itself
or
is
secured
or
else
when
other
karma
tending
to
restrict
its
operations
is
removed
but
one
does
not
necessarily
have
to
wait
until
a
future
life
in
order
to
set
into
operation
and
manifestation
the
karma
of
the
present
life
for
there
come
times
in
which
there
being
no
obstructing
karma
brought
over
from
a
past
life
the
present
life
karma
may
begin
to
manifest
the
karma
brought
over
from
past
incarnations
which
is
not
able
to
manifest
at
the
present
time
owing
to
the
opposition
presented
by
other
karma
of
an
opposite
nature
serves
to
hold
the
first
in
check
it
is
a
well
known
physical
law
which
likewise
manifests
on
the
mental
plane
that
two
opposing
forces
result
in
neutralization
that
is
both
of
the
forces
are
held
in
check
of
course
though
a
more
powerful
karma
may
manage
to
operate
while
a
weaker
is
held
in
check
by
it
not
only
have
individuals
their
own
karma
but
families
races
nations
and
worlds
have
their
collective
karma
in
the
cases
of
races
if
the
race
karma
generated
in
the
past
be
favorable
on
the
whole
the
race
flourishes
and
its
influence
widens
if
on
the
contrary
its
collective
karma
be
bad
the
race
gradually
disappears
from
the
face
of
the
earth
the
souls
constituting
it
separating
according
to
their
karmic
attractions
some
going
to
this
race
and
some
to
another
nations
are
bound
by
their
karma
as
any
student
of
history
may
perceive
if
he
studies
closely
the
tides
of
national
progress
or
decline
the
karma
of
a
nation
is
made
up
of
the
collective
karma
of
the
individuals
composing
it
so
far
as
their
thoughts
and
acts
have
to
do
with
the
national
spirit
and
acts
nations
as
nations
cease
to
exist
but
the
souls
of
the
individuals
composing
them
still
live
on
and
make
their
influence
felt
in
new
races
scenes
and
environments
the
ancient
egyptians
persians
medes
chaldeans
romans
grecians
and
many
other
ancient
races
have
disappeared
but
their
reincarnating
souls
are
with
us
the
modern
revival
of
occultism
is
caused
by
an
influx
of
the
souls
of
these
old
peoples
pouring
in
on
the
western
worlds
the
following
quotation
from
secret
that
remarkable
piece
of
occult
literature
will
be
interesting
at
this
point
nor
would
the
ways
of
karma
be
inscrutable
were
men
to
work
in
union
and
harmony
instead
of
disunion
and
strife
for
our
ignorance
of
those
ways
which
one
portion
of
mankind
calls
the
ways
of
providence
dark
and
intricate
while
another
sees
in
them
the
action
of
blind
fatalism
and
a
third
simple
chance
with
neither
gods
nor
devils
to
guide
them
would
surely
disappear
if
we
would
but
attribute
all
these
to
their
correct
cause
with
right
knowledge
or
at
any
rate
with
a
confident
conviction
that
our
neighbors
will
no
more
work
harm
to
us
than
we
would
think
of
harming
them
of
the
world
evil
would
vanish
into
thin
air
were
no
man
to
hurt
his
brother
would
have
neither
cause
to
work
for
nor
weapons
to
act
through
we
cut
these
numerous
windings
in
our
destinies
daily
with
our
own
hands
while
we
imagine
that
we
are
pursuing
a
track
on
the
royal
road
of
respectability
and
duty
and
then
complain
of
those
ways
being
so
intricate
and
so
dark
we
stand
bewildered
before
the
mystery
of
our
own
making
and
the
riddles
of
life
that
we
will
not
solve
and
then
accuse
the
great
sphinx
of
devouring
us
but
verily
there
is
not
an
accident
in
our
lives
not
a
misshapen
day
or
a
misfortune
that
could
not
be
traced
back
to
our
own
doings
in
this
or
another
life
knowledge
of
karma
gives
the
conviction
that
if
in
distress
and
vice
in
triumph
makes
atheists
of
mankind
it
is
only
because
that
mankind
has
ever
shut
its
eyes
to
the
great
truth
that
man
is
himself
his
own
savior
as
his
own
destroyer
that
he
need
not
accuse
heaven
and
the
gods
fates
and
providence
of
the
apparent
injustice
that
reigns
in
the
midst
of
humanity
but
let
him
rather
remember
that
bit
of
grecian
wisdom
which
warns
man
to
forbear
accusing
that
which
though
mysterious
leads
us
on
unerring
through
ways
unmarked
from
guilt
to
punishment
which
are
now
the
ways
and
the
high
road
on
which
move
onward
the
great
european
nations
the
western
aryans
have
every
nation
and
tribe
like
their
eastern
brethren
of
the
fifth
race
their
golden
and
their
iron
ages
their
period
of
comparative
irresponsibility
or
the
satya
age
of
purity
while
now
several
of
them
have
reached
their
iron
age
the
an
age
black
with
horrors
this
state
will
last
until
we
begin
acting
from
within
instead
of
ever
following
impulses
from
without
until
then
the
only
palliative
is
union
and
harmony
a
brotherhood
in
and
not
simply
in
name
edwin
arnold
in
his
wonderful
poem
the
light
of
asia
which
tells
the
story
of
the
buddha
explains
the
doctrine
of
karma
from
the
buddhist
standpoint
we
feel
that
our
students
should
become
acquainted
with
this
view
so
beautifully
expressed
and
so
we
herewith
quote
the
passages
referred
to
karma
all
that
total
of
a
soul
which
is
the
things
it
did
the
thoughts
it
had
the
it
wove
with
woof
of
viewless
time
crossed
on
the

invisible
of
acts
what
hath
been
bringeth
what
shall
be
and
is
worse
better
last
for
first
and
first
for

the
angels
in
the
heavens
of
gladness

fruits
of
a
holy
past
the
devils
in
the
underworlds
wear
out
deeds
that
were
wicked
in
an
age
gone
by
nothing

fair
virtues
waste
with
time
foul
sins
grow
purged
thereby
who
toiled
a
slave
may
come
anew
a
prince
for
gentle
worthiness
and
merit

who
ruled
a
king
may
wander
earth
in
rags
for
things
done
and
undone
before
beginning
and
without
an
end
as
space
eternal
and
as
surety
sure
is
fixed
a
power
divine
which
moves
to
good
only
its
laws

it
will
not
be
contemned
of
any
one
who
thwarts
it
loses
and
who
serves
it

the
hidden

it
pays

the

it

the

the

the

which
none
at

can
turn
aside
or
stay
the
heart
of
it
is
love
the
end
of
it
is
peace

obey
the
books
say
well
my
brothers
each
man
life
the
outcome
of
his
former
living
is
the
bygone
wrongs
bring
forth
sorrow
and

the
bygone

bliss
that
which
ye
sow

nothing

whose

is
quick
and
mighty
far
and
near
so
that
fruits
follow
it
no
need
hath
such
to
live
as
ye
name
life
that
which
began
in
him
when
he
began
is
finished
he
hath
wrought
the
purpose
through
of
what
did
make
him
man
never
shall
yearnings
torture
him
nor
sins
stain
him
nor
ache
of
earthly
joys
and
woes
invade
his
safe
eternal
peace
nor
deaths
and
lives
recur
he
goes
unto
nirvana
he
is
one
with
life
yet
lives
not
he
is
blest
ceasing
to
be
om
mani
padme
om
the
dewdrop
slips
into
the
shining
sea
this
is
the
doctrine
of
the
karma
learn
only
when
all
the
dross
of
sin
is
quit
only
when
life
dies
like
a
white
flame
spent
death
dies
along
with
it
and
so
friends
this
is
a
brief
account
of
the
operations
of
the
law
of
karma
the
subject
is
one
of
such
wide
scope
that
the
brief
space
at
our
disposal
enables
us
to
do
little
more
than
to
call
your
attention
to
the
existence
of
the
law
and
some
of
its
general
workings
we
advise
our
students
to
acquaint
themselves
thoroughly
with
what
has
been
written
on
this
subject
by
ourselves
and
others
in
our
first
series
of
lessons
the
fourteen
lessons
the
chapter
or
lesson
on
spiritual
cause
and
effect
was
devoted
to
the
subject
of
karma
we
advise
our
students
to
it
we
also
suggest
that
occult
story
entitled
karma
gives
its
readers
an
excellent
idea
of
the
actual
working
of
karma
in
the
everyday
lives
of
people
of
our
own
times
we
recommend
the
book
to
the
consideration
of
our
students
it
is
published
at
a
popular
price
and
is
well
worth
the
consideration
of
every
one
interested
in
this
wonderful
subject
of
reincarnation
and
karma
the
twelfth
lesson
occult
miscellany
in
this
the
last
lesson
of
this
series
we
wish
to
call
your
attention
to
a
variety
of
subjects
coming
under
the
general
head
of
the
yogi
philosophy
and
yet
apparently
separated
from
one
another
and
so
we
have
entitled
this
lesson
occult
miscellany
inasmuch
as
it
is
made
up
of
bits
of
information
upon
a
variety
of
subjects
all
connected
with
the
general
teaching
of
the
series
the
lesson
will
consist
of
answers
to
a
number
of
questions
asked
by
various
students
of
the
courses
in
yogi
philosophy
coming
from
our
pen
while
these
answers
of
necessity
must
be
brief
still
we
will
endeavor
to
condense
considerable
information
into
each
so
that
read
as
a
whole
the
lesson
will
give
to
our
students
a
variety
of
information
upon
several
important
subjects
question
are
there
any
brotherhoods
of
advanced
occultists
in
existence
in
harmony
with
the
yogi
teachings
and
if
so
what
information
can
you
give
regarding
them
answer
yes
there
are
a
number
of
occult
brotherhoods
of
varying
degrees
of
advancement
scattered
through
the
various
countries
of
the
earth
these
brotherhoods
agree
in
principle
with
the
yogi
teachings
although
the
methods
of
interpretation
may
vary
somewhat
there
is
but
one
truth
which
becomes
apparent
to
all
deep
students
of
occultism
and
therefore
all
true
occultists
have
a
glimpse
of
that
truth
and
upon
this
glimpse
is
founded
their
philosophies
and
teachings
these
occult
brotherhoods
vary
in
their
nature
in
some
the
members
are
grouped
together
in
retired
portions
of
the
earth
dwelling
in
the
community
life
in
others
the
headquarters
are
in
the
large
cities
of
the
earth
their
membership
being
composed
of
residents
of
those
cities
with
outlying
branches
others
have
no
meeting
places
their
work
being
managed
from
headquarters
their
members
being
scattered
all
over
the
face
of
the
earth
the
communication
being
kept
up
by
personal
correspondence
and
privately
printed
and
circulated
literature
admission
to
these
true
occult
brotherhoods
is
difficult
they
seek
their
members
not
the
members
them
no
amount
of
money
or
influence
or
energy
can
gain
entrance
to
these
societies
they
seek
to
impart
information
and
instruction
only
to
those
who
are
prepared
to
receive
it
to
those
who
have
reached
that
stage
of
spiritual
unfoldment
that
will
enable
them
to
grasp
and
assimilate
the
teachings
of
the
inner
circles
while
this
is
true
it
is
also
true
that
these
societies
or
brotherhoods
are
engaged
in
disseminating
occult
knowledge
suited
to
the
minds
of
the
public
through
various
channels
and
cloaked
in
various
disguises
of
name
authority
and
style
their
idea
is
to
gradually
open
the
mind
of
the
public
to
the
great
truths
underlying
and
back
of
all
of
these
various
fragmentary
teachings
and
they
recognize
the
fact
that
one
mind
may
be
reached
in
a
certain
way
and
another
mind
in
a
second
way
and
so
on
and
accordingly
they
wrap
their
teachings
in
covers
likely
to
attract
the
attention
of
various
people
and
to
cause
them
to
investigate
the
contents
but
under
and
back
of
all
of
these
various
teachings
is
the
great
fundamental
truth
it
has
often
been
asked
of
us
how
one
might
distinguish
the
real
brotherhoods
from
the
spurious
ones
which
have
assumed
the
name
and
general
style
of
the
true
societies
for
the
purpose
of
exploiting
the
public
and
making
money
from
their
interest
in
the
great
occult
truths
answering
this
we
would
say
that
the
true
occult
brotherhoods
and
societies
sell
their
it
is
given
free
as
water
to
those
who
seek
for
it
and
is
never
sold
for
money
the
true
adept
would
as
soon
think
of
selling
his
soul
as
selling
spiritual
knowledge
for
gain
while
money
plays
its
proper
place
in
the
world
and
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
and
while
the
masters
recognize
the
propriety
of
the
sale
of
books
on
occultism
providing
the
price
is
reasonable
and
not
in
excess
of
the
general
market
price
of
books
and
while
they
also
recognize
the
propriety
of
having
people
pay
their
part
of
the
expenses
of
maintaining
organizations
magazines
lecturers
instructors
still
the
idea
stops
there
it
does
not
extend
to
the
selling
of
the
inner
secrets
of
occultism
for
silver
or
gold
therefore
if
you
are
solicited
to
become
a
member
of
any
brotherhood
or
occult
society
for
a
consideration
of
money
you
will
know
at
once
that
the
organization
is
not
a
true
occult
society
for
it
has
violated
one
of
the
cardinal
principles
at
the
start
remember
the
old
occult
maxim
when
the
pupil
is
ready
the
master
appears
and
so
it
is
with
the
brotherhoods
and
societies
if
it
is
necessary
for
your
growth
development
and
attainment
to
be
connected
with
one
of
these
organizations
then
when
the
time
comes
when
you
are
ready
you
will
receive
your
call
and
then
will
know
for
a
certainty
that
those
who
call
are
the
true
messengers
of
truth
question
ii
there
any
exalted
human
beings
called
masters
or
adepts
or
are
the
tales
regarding
them
mere
fables
etc
answer
of
a
truth
there
are
certain
highly
developed
advanced
and
exalted
souls
in
the
flesh
known
as
masters
and
adepts
although
many
of
the
tales
told
concerning
them
are
myths
or
pure
fiction
originating
in
the
minds
of
some
modern
sensational
writers
and
moreover
these
souls
are
members
of
the
great
lodge
an
organization
composed
of
these
almost
beings
these
great
souls
that
have
advanced
so
very
far
on
the
path
before
beginning
to
speak
of
them
let
us
answer
a
question
often
asked
by
western
people
and
that
is
why
do
not
these
people
appear
to
the
world
and
show
their
powers
each
of
you
may
answer
that
question
from
your
own
experiences
have
you
ever
been
foolish
enough
to
open
your
soul
to
the
crowd
and
have
it
reveal
the
sacred
truth
that
rests
there
have
you
ever
attempted
to
impart
the
highest
teachings
known
to
you
to
persons
who
had
not
attained
sufficient
spiritual
development
to
even
understand
the
meaning
of
your
words
have
you
ever
committed
the
folly
of
throwing
spiritual
pearls
to
material
swine
if
you
have
had
these
experiences
you
may
begin
to
faintly
imagine
the
reasons
of
these
illumined
souls
for
keeping
away
from
the
crowd
for
dwelling
away
from
the
multitude
no
one
who
has
not
suffered
the
pain
of
having
the
vulgar
crowd
revile
the
highest
spiritual
truths
to
him
can
begin
to
understand
the
feelings
of
the
spiritually
illumined
individuals
it
is
not
that
they
feel
that
they
are
better
or
more
exalted
than
the
humblest
man
for
these
feelings
of
the
personality
have
long
since
left
them
it
is
because
they
see
the
folly
of
attempting
to
present
the
highest
truths
to
a
public
which
is
not
prepared
to
understand
even
the
elementary
teachings
it
is
a
feeling
akin
to
that
of
the
master
of
the
highest
musical
conceptions
attempting
to
produce
his
wonderful
compositions
before
a
crowd
fit
only
for
the
and
slangy
songs
of
the
day
then
again
these
masters
have
no
desire
to
work
miracles
which
would
only
cause
the
public
to
become
still
more
superstitious
than
they
now
are
when
one
glances
back
over
the
field
of
religions
and
sees
how
the
miraculous
acts
of
some
of
the
great
leaders
have
been
prostituted
and
used
as
a
foundation
for
the
grossest
credulity
and
basest
superstition
he
may
understand
the
wisdom
of
the
masters
in
this
respect
there
is
another
reason
for
the
of
the
masters
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
occasion
for
it
the
laws
of
spiritual
evolution
are
as
regular
constant
and
fixed
as
are
the
laws
of
physical
evolution
and
any
attempt
to
unduly
force
matters
only
results
in
confusion
and
the
abortive
results
soon
fade
away
the
world
is
not
ready
for
the
appearance
of
the
masters
their
appearance
at
this
time
would
not
be
in
accordance
with
the
plan
the
masters
or
adepts
are
human
beings
who
have
passed
from
lower
to
higher
planes
of
consciousness
thus
gaining
wisdom
power
and
qualities
that
seem
almost
miraculous
to
the
man
of
the
ordinary
consciousness
a
hindu
writer
speaking
of
them
has
said
to
him
who
hath
traveled
far
along
the
path
sorrow
ceases
to
trouble
fetters
cease
to
bind
obstacles
cease
to
hinder
such
an
one
is
free
for
him
there
is
no
more
fever
or
sorrow
for
him
there
are
no
more
unconscious
his
old
karma
is
exhausted
and
he
creates
no
new
karma
his
heart
is
freed
from
the
desire
for
future
life
no
new
longings
arise
within
his
soul
he
is
like
a
lamp
which
burneth
from
the
oil
of
the
spirit
and
not
from
the
oil
of
the
outer
world
lillie
in
his
work
on
buddhism
tells
his
readers
six
supernatural
faculties
were
expected
of
the
ascetic
before
he
could
claim
the
grade
of
they
are
constantly
alluded
to
in
the
as
the
six
supernatural
faculties
usually
without
further
specification
in
this
transitory
body
the
intelligence
of
man
is
enchained
the
ascetic
finding
himself
thus
confused
directs
his
mind
to
the
creation
of
he
represents
to
himself
in
thought
another
body
created
from
this
material
body
a
body
with
a
form
members
and
organs
this
body
in
relation
to
the
material
body
is
like
a
sword
and
the
scabbard
or
a
serpent
issuing
from
a
basket
in
which
it
is
confined
the
ascetic
then
purified
and
perfected
begins
to
practice
supernatural
faculties
he
finds
himself
able
to
pass
through
material
obstacles
walls
ramparts
etc
he
is
able
to
throw
his
phantasmal
appearance
into
many
places
at
once
he
acquires
the
power
of
hearing
the
sounds
of
the
unseen
world
as
distinctly
as
those
of
the
phenomenal
world
more
distinctly
in
point
of
fact
also
by
the
power
of
he
is
able
to
read
the
most
secret
thoughts
of
others
and
to
tell
their
characters
these
great
masters
are
above
all
petty
sectarian
distinctions
they
may
have
ascended
to
their
exalted
position
along
the
paths
of
the
many
religions
or
they
may
have
walked
the
path
of
sect
or
body
they
may
have
mounted
to
their
heights
by
philosophical
reasoning
alone
or
else
by
scientific
investigation
they
are
called
by
many
names
according
to
the
viewpoint
of
the
speaker
but
at
the
last
they
are
of
but
one
religion
one
philosophy
one
belief
truth
the
state
of
adeptship
is
reached
only
after
a
long
and
arduous
apprenticeship
extending
over
many
lives
those
who
have
reached
the
pinnacle
were
once
even
as
you
who
read
these
lines
and
some
of
you
yes
perhaps
even
you
who
are
now
reading
these
words
may
have
taken
the
first
steps
along
the
narrow
path
which
will
lead
you
to
heights
equally
as
exalted
as
those
occupied
by
even
the
highest
of
these
great
beings
of
whom
we
are
speaking
unconsciously
to
yourself
the
urge
of
the
spirit
has
set
your
feet
firmly
upon
the
path
and
will
push
you
forward
to
the
end
in
order
to
understand
the
occult
custom
that
finds
its
full
fruit
in
the
seclusion
of
the
masters
one
needs
to
be
acquainted
with
the
universal
habit
among
true
occultists
of
refraining
from
public
or
vulgar
displays
of
occult
power
while
the
inferior
occultists
often
exhibit
some
of
the
minor
manifestations
to
the
public
it
is
a
fact
that
the
true
advanced
occultists
scrupulously
refrain
from
so
doing
in
fact
among
the
highest
teachers
it
is
a
condition
imposed
upon
the
pupil
that
he
shall
refrain
from
exhibitions
of
his
developing
powers
among
the
uninitiated
public
the
neophyte
is
bound
over
to
the
most
inviolable
secrecy
as
to
everything
connected
with
his
entrance
and
further
progress
in
the
schools
in
asia
in
the
same
way
the
or
pupil
of
occultism
no
sooner
becomes
a
than
he
ceases
to
be
a
witness
on
behalf
of
the
reality
of
occult
knowledge
says
sinnett
in
his
great
work
on
esoteric
buddhism
and
he
then
adds
i
have
been
astonished
to
find
since
my
own
connection
with
the
subject
how
numerous
such
are
but
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
any
human
act
more
improbable
than
the
unauthorized
revelation
by
any
such
to
persons
in
the
outer
world
that
he
is
one
and
so
the
great
esoteric
school
of
philosophy
guards
its
seclusion
question
iii
the
yogi
philosophy
teach
that
there
is
a
place
corresponding
to
the
of
the
various
religions
is
there
any
basis
for
the
belief
that
there
is
a
place
resembling
answer
yes
the
yogi
philosophy
teach
that
there
is
a
real
basis
for
the
popular
religious
beliefs
in
heaven
and
that
there
are
states
of
being
the
knowledge
of
which
has
filtered
through
to
the
masses
in
the
more
or
less
distorted
theories
regarding
heavens
but
the
yogis
do
not
teach
that
these
heavens
are
at
all
the
teaching
is
that
they
are
of
it
is
difficult
to
explain
just
what
is
meant
by
this
word
plane
the
nearest
approach
to
it
in
english
is
the
term
or
word
state
a
portion
of
space
may
be
occupied
by
several
planes
at
the
same
time
just
as
a
room
may
be
filled
with
the
rays
of
the
sun
those
of
a
lamp
magnetic
and
electric
vibrations
and
waves
each
interpenetrating
each
other
and
yet
not
affecting
or
interfering
with
each
other
on
the
lower
planes
of
the
astral
world
there
are
to
be
found
the
souls
which
have
passed
out
from
their
former
bodies
but
which
are
attracted
to
the
earthly
scenes
by
strong
attractions
which
serve
to
weight
them
down
and
to
prevent
them
from
ascending
to
the
higher
planes
on
the
higher
planes
are
souls
that
are
less
bound
by
earthly
attractions
and
who
accordingly
are
relieved
of
the
weight
resulting
therefrom
these
planes
rise
in
an
ascending
scale
each
plane
being
higher
and
more
spiritual
than
the
one
lower
than
itself
and
dwelling
on
each
plane
are
the
souls
fitted
to
occupy
it
by
reason
of
their
degree
of
spiritual
development
or
evolution
when
the
soul
first
leaves
the
body
it
falls
into
a
stage
from
which
it
awakens
to
find
itself
on
the
plane
for
which
it
is
fitted
by
reason
of
its
development
attractions
character
etc
the
particular
plane
occupied
by
each
soul
is
determined
by
the
progress
and
attainment
it
has
made
in
its
past
lives
the
souls
on
the
higher
planes
may
and
often
do
visit
the
planes
lower
in
the
scale
than
their
own
but
those
on
the
lower
planes
may
not
visit
those
higher
than
their
own
quoting
from
our
own
writings
on
this
subject
published
several
years
ago
we
repeat
this
prohibition
regarding
the
visiting
of
higher
planes
is
not
an
arbitrary
rule
but
a
law
of
nature
if
the
student
will
pardon
the
commonplace
comparison
he
may
get
an
understanding
of
it
by
imagining
a
large
screen
or
series
of
screens
such
as
used
for
sorting
coal
into
sizes
the
large
coal
is
caught
by
the
first
screen
the
next
size
by
the
second
and
so
on
until
the
tiny
coal
is
reached
now
the
large
coal
can
not
get
into
the
receptacle
of
the
smaller
sizes
but
the
small
sizes
may
easily
pass
through
the
screen
and
join
the
larger
sizes
if
force
be
imparted
to
them
just
so
in
the
astral
world
the
soul
with
the
greatest
amount
of
materiality
and
gross
nature
is
stopped
by
the
spiritual
screen
of
a
certain
plane
and
can
not
pass
on
to
the
higher
ones
while
other
souls
have
cast
off
some
of
the
confining
and
retarding
material
sheaths
and
readily
pass
on
to
higher
and
finer
planes
and
it
may
be
readily
seen
that
those
souls
which
dwell
on
the
higher
planes
are
able
to
the
lower
and
grosser
planes
while
the
souls
on
the
grosser
can
not
penetrate
the
higher
boundries
of
their
plane
being
stopped
by
the
spiritual
screen
the
comparison
is
a
crude
one
but
it
almost
exactly
pictures
the
existing
conditions
on
the
spiritual
world
souls
on
the
upper
planes
may
and
often
do
journey
to
the
lower
planes
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
the
souls
of
friends
who
may
be
dwelling
there
and
thus
affording
them
comfort
and
consolation
in
fact
the
teaching
is
that
in
many
cases
a
highly
developed
soul
visits
souls
on
the
lower
planes
in
whom
it
is
interested
and
actually
imparts
spiritual
teaching
and
instruction
to
those
souls
so
that
they
may
be
into
much
better
conditions
than
would
have
been
the
case
otherwise
all
of
the
planes
have
spiritual
instructors
from
very
high
planes
who
sacrifice
their
rest
and
happiness
on
their
own
planes
in
order
that
they
may
work
for
the
souls
on
the
lower
planes
as
we
have
said
the
soul
awakens
on
the
plane
to
which
it
is
suited
it
finds
itself
in
the
company
of
congenial
souls
in
whose
company
it
is
enabled
to
pursue
those
things
which
were
dear
to
its
heart
when
alive
it
may
be
able
to
make
considerable
advancement
during
its
sojourn
in
heaven
which
will
result
to
its
benefit
when
it
is
reborn
on
earth
there
are
countless
adapted
to
the
infinite
requirements
of
the
advancing
souls
in
every
degree
of
development
and
each
soul
finds
an
opportunity
to
develop
and
enjoy
to
the
fullest
the
highest
of
which
it
is
capable
and
to
also
perfect
itself
and
to
prepare
itself
for
future
development
so
that
it
may
be
under
the
very
best
possible
conditions
and
circumstances
in
the
next
earth
life
but
alas
even
in
this
higher
world
all
souls
do
not
live
up
to
the
best
that
is
in
them
and
instead
of
making
the
best
of
their
opportunities
for
development
and
growing
spiritually
they
allow
the
attractions
of
their
material
natures
to
draw
them
downward
and
too
often
spend
much
of
their
time
on
the
planes
beneath
them
not
to
help
and
assist
but
to
live
the
less
spiritual
lives
of
their
friends
on
the
lower
planes
in
such
cases
the
soul
does
not
reap
the
benefit
of
the
sojourn
in
the
but
is
born
again
according
to
the
attractions
of
its
lower
instead
of
its
higher
nature
and
is
compelled
to
learn
its
lesson
over
again
the
yogi
teachings
inform
us
that
the
lower
planes
of
the
astral
world
are
inhabited
by
souls
of
a
very
gross
and
degraded
type
undeveloped
and
these
low
souls
live
out
the
tendencies
and
characteristics
of
their
former
earth
lives
and
reincarnate
rapidly
in
order
to
pursue
their
material
attractions
of
course
there
is
slowly
working
even
in
these
undeveloped
souls
an
upward
tendency
but
it
is
so
slow
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
in
time
these
undeveloped
souls
grow
sick
and
tired
of
their
materiality
and
then
comes
the
chance
for
a
slight
advance
of
course
these
undeveloped
souls
have
no
access
to
the
higher
planes
of
the
astral
world
but
are
confined
to
their
own
degraded
plane
and
to
the
which
separate
the
astral
world
from
the
material
world
they
cling
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
earthly
scenes
and
are
separated
from
the
material
world
by
only
a
thin
screen
if
we
may
use
the
word
they
suffer
the
tantalizing
condition
of
being
within
sight
and
hearing
of
their
old
material
scenes
and
environments
and
yet
unable
to
manifest
on
them
these
souls
form
the
low
class
of
spirits
of
which
we
hear
so
much
in
certain
circles
they
hang
around
their
old
scenes
of
debauchery
and
sense
gratification
and
often
are
able
to
influence
the
minds
of
living
persons
along
the
same
line
and
plane
of
development
for
instance
these
creatures
hover
around
low
saloons
and
places
of
influencing
the
sodden
brains
of
living
persons
to
participate
in
the
illicit
gratifications
of
the
lower
sensual
nature
souls
on
the
higher
planes
are
not
bound
by
these
earthly
and
material
attractions
and
take
advantage
of
their
opportunities
to
improve
themselves
and
develop
spiritually
it
is
a
rule
of
the
astral
world
that
the
higher
the
plane
occupied
by
a
soul
the
longer
the
sojourn
there
between
incarnations
a
soul
on
the
lowest
planes
may
reincarnate
in
a
very
short
time
while
on
the
higher
planes
hundreds
and
even
thousands
of
years
may
elapse
before
the
soul
is
called
upon
to
experience
but
comes
to
all
who
have
not
passed
on
to
other
spheres
of
life
sooner
or
later
the
soul
feels
that
inward
urge
toward
and
further
experience
and
becomes
drowsy
and
falls
into
a
state
resembling
sleep
when
it
is
caught
up
in
the
current
that
is
sweeping
on
toward
and
is
gradually
carried
on
to
in
conditions
chosen
by
its
desires
and
characteristics
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
the
laws
of
karma
from
the
it
passes
through
what
may
be
called
a
death
on
the
astral
plane
when
it
is
on
the
earth
plane
but
remember
this
the
soul
when
it
is
on
earth
does
not
fully
awaken
from
its
astral
sleep
in
infancy
and
in
early
childhood
the
soul
is
but
slowly
awakening
gradually
from
year
to
year
the
brain
being
built
to
accommodate
this
growth
the
rare
instances
of
precocious
children
and
infant
genius
are
cases
in
which
the
awakening
has
been
more
rapid
than
ordinary
on
the
other
hand
cases
are
known
where
the
soul
does
not
awaken
as
rapidly
as
the
average
and
the
result
is
that
the
person
does
not
show
signs
of
full
intellectual
activity
until
nearly
middle
age
cases
are
known
when
men
seemed
to
wake
up
when
they
were
forty
years
of
age
or
even
later
in
life
and
would
then
take
on
a
freshened
activity
and
energy
surprising
those
who
had
known
them
before
on
some
of
the
planes
of
the
astral
world
the
souls
dwelling
there
do
not
seem
to
realize
that
they
are
dead
but
act
and
live
as
if
they
were
in
the
flesh
they
have
a
knowledge
of
the
planes
beneath
them
just
as
we
on
earth
know
of
conditions
beneath
us
spiritually
but
they
seem
to
be
in
almost
absolute
ignorance
of
the
planes
above
them
just
as
many
of
us
on
earth
can
not
comprehend
the
existence
of
beings
more
highly
developed
spiritually
than
ourselves
this
of
course
is
only
true
of
the
souls
who
have
not
been
made
acquainted
with
the
meaning
and
nature
of
life
on
the
astral
plane
those
who
have
acquired
this
information
and
knowledge
readily
understand
their
condition
and
profit
thereby
it
will
be
seen
from
this
that
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
for
persons
to
become
acquainted
with
the
great
laws
of
occultism
in
their
present
earth
life
for
the
reason
that
when
they
pass
out
of
the
body
and
enter
some
one
of
the
astral
planes
they
will
not
be
in
ignorance
of
the
condition
but
will
readily
grasp
the
meaning
and
nature
of
their
surroundings
and
take
advantage
of
the
same
in
order
to
develop
themselves
more
rapidly
it
will
be
seen
from
what
has
been
written
by
us
here
and
elsewhere
that
there
are
planes
after
planes
on
the
astral
side
of
life
all
that
has
been
dreamt
of
heaven
purgatory
or
hell
has
its
correspondence
there
although
not
in
the
literal
sense
in
which
these
things
have
been
taught
for
instance
a
wicked
man
dying
immersed
in
his
desires
and
longings
of
his
lower
nature
and
believing
that
he
will
be
punished
in
a
future
life
for
sins
committed
on
earth
such
a
one
is
very
apt
to
awaken
on
the
lower
planes
or
in
conditions
corresponding
with
his
former
fears
he
finds
the
fire
and
brimstone
awaiting
him
although
these
things
are
merely
figments
of
his
own
imagination
and
having
no
existence
in
reality
murderers
may
roam
for
ages
apparently
pursued
by
the
bleeding
corpses
of
their
victims
until
such
a
horror
of
the
crime
arises
in
the
mind
that
at
last
sinking
from
exhaustion
into
the
their
souls
pass
into
with
such
a
horror
of
bloodshed
and
crime
as
to
make
them
entirely
different
beings
in
the
new
life
and
yet
the
hell
that
they
went
through
existed
only
in
their
imaginations
they
were
their
own
devil
and
hell
just
as
a
man
in
earth
life
may
suffer
from
so
some
of
these
souls
on
the
astral
plane
suffer
agonies
from
their
delirium
arising
from
their
former
crimes
and
the
belief
in
the
punishment
therefor
which
has
been
inculcated
in
them
through
earth
teachings
and
these
mental
agonies
although
terrible
really
are
for
their
benefit
for
by
reason
of
them
the
soul
becomes
so
sickened
with
the
thought
and
idea
of
crime
that
when
it
is
finally
it
manifests
a
marked
repulsion
to
it
and
flies
to
the
opposite
in
this
connection
we
would
say
that
the
teaching
is
that
although
the
depraved
soul
apparently
experiences
ages
of
this
torment
yet
in
reality
there
is
but
the
passage
of
but
a
short
time
the
illusion
arising
from
the
of
the
soul
just
as
arises
the
illusion
of
the
punishment
itself
in
the
same
way
the
soul
often
experiences
a
heaven
in
accordance
with
its
hopes
beliefs
and
longings
of
the
heaven
that
it
has
longed
for
and
believed
in
during
its
is
very
apt
to
be
at
least
partially
reproduced
on
the
astral
plane
and
the
pious
soul
of
any
and
all
religious
denominations
finds
itself
in
a
heaven
corresponding
to
that
in
which
it
believed
during
its
the
mohammedan
finds
his
paradise
the
christian
finds
his
the
indian
finds
his
but
the
impression
is
merely
an
illusion
created
by
the
mental
pictures
of
the
soul
but
the
illusion
tends
to
give
pleasure
to
the
soul
and
to
satisfy
certain
longings
which
in
time
fade
away
leaving
the
soul
free
to
reach
out
after
higher
conceptions
and
ideals
we
can
not
devote
more
space
to
this
subject
at
this
time
and
must
content
ourselves
with
the
above
statements
and
explanations
the
principal
point
that
we
desire
to
impress
upon
your
minds
is
the
fact
that
the
is
not
a
place
or
state
of
permanent
rest
and
abode
for
the
disembodied
soul
but
is
merely
a
place
or
temporary
sojourn
between
incarnations
and
thus
serves
as
a
place
of
rest
wherein
the
soul
may
gather
together
its
forces
energies
desires
and
attractions
preparatory
to
in
this
answer
we
have
merely
limited
ourselves
to
a
general
statement
of
the
states
and
conditions
of
the
astral
world
or
rather
of
certain
planes
of
that
world
the
subject
itself
requires
far
more
extensive
treatment
question
iv
nirvana
a
state
of
the
total
extinction
of
consciousness
and
is
it
a
place
state
or
condition
answer
the
teaching
concerning
the
final
goal
of
the
soul
has
been
much
misunderstood
and
much
error
has
crept
into
the
teaching
even
among
some
very
worthy
teachers
to
conceive
of
as
a
state
of
extinction
of
consciousness
would
be
to
fall
into
the
error
of
the
pessimistic
school
of
philosophy
which
thinks
of
life
and
consciousness
as
a
curse
and
regards
the
return
into
a
total
unconsciousness
as
the
thing
to
be
most
desired
the
true
teaching
is
that
is
a
state
of
the
fullest
consciousness
a
state
in
which
the
soul
is
relieved
of
all
the
illusion
of
separateness
and
relativity
and
enters
into
a
state
of
universal
consciousness
or
absolute
awareness
in
which
it
is
conscious
of
infinity
and
eternity
of
all
places
and
things
and
time
instead
of
being
a
state
of
nothingness
is
a
state
of
everythingness
as
the
soul
advances
along
the
path
it
becomes
more
and
more
aware
of
its
connection
with
relation
to
and
identity
with
the
whole
as
it
grows
the
self
enlarges
and
transcends
its
former
limited
bounds
it
begins
to
realize
that
it
is
more
than
the
tiny
separated
atom
that
it
had
believed
itself
to
be
and
it
learns
to
identify
itself
in
a
constantly
increasing
scale
with
the
universal
life
it
feels
a
sense
of
oneness
in
a
fuller
degree
and
it
sets
its
feet
firmly
upon
the
path
toward
after
many
weary
lives
on
this
and
other
planets
in
this
and
other
universes
after
it
has
long
since
left
behind
it
the
scale
of
humanity
and
has
advanced
into
states
its
consciousness
becomes
fuller
and
fuller
and
time
and
space
are
transcended
in
a
wonderful
manner
and
at
last
the
goal
is
attained
the
battle
is
won
and
the
soul
blossoms
into
a
state
of
universal
consciousness
in
which
time
and
place
disappear
and
in
which
every
place
is
here
every
period
of
time
is
now
and
everything
is
i
this
is
question
v
is
that
which
occultists
call
astral
shell
or
similar
name
is
it
an
entity
or
force
or
being
answer
when
the
soul
passes
out
from
the
body
at
the
moment
of
death
it
carries
with
it
the
astral
body
as
well
as
the
higher
mental
and
spiritual
principles
see
the
first
three
lessons
in
the
fourteen
lessons
the
astral
body
is
the
counterpart
of
the
material
or
physical
body
although
it
is
composed
of
matter
of
a
much
finer
and
ethereal
nature
than
is
the
physical
body
it
is
invisible
to
the
ordinary
eye
but
may
be
seen
clairvoyantly
the
astral
body
rises
from
the
physical
body
like
a
faint
luminous
vapor
and
for
a
time
is
connected
with
the
dying
physical
body
by
a
thin
vapory
cord
or
thread
which
finally
breaks
entirely
and
the
separation
becomes
complete
the
astral
body
is
some
time
afterward
discarded
by
the
soul
as
it
passes
on
to
the
higher
planes
as
we
have
described
a
few
pages
further
back
and
the
abandoned
astral
body
becomes
an
astral
shell
and
is
subject
to
a
slow
disintegration
just
as
is
the
physical
body
it
is
no
more
the
soul
than
is
the
physical
body
it
is
merely
a
cast
off
garment
of
fine
matter
it
will
be
seen
readily
that
it
is
not
an
entity
force
or
being
it
is
only
cast
off
matter
a
sloughed
skin
it
has
no
life
or
intelligence
but
floats
around
on
the
lower
astral
plane
until
it
finally
disintegrates
it
has
an
attraction
toward
its
late
physical
associate
the
physical
body
and
often
returns
to
the
place
where
the
latter
is
buried
where
it
is
sometimes
seen
by
persons
whose
astral
sight
is
temporarily
awakened
when
it
is
mistaken
for
a
ghost
or
spirit
of
the
person
these
astral
shells
are
often
seen
floating
around
over
graveyards
battlefields
etc
and
sometimes
these
shells
coming
in
contact
with
the
psychic
magnetism
of
a
medium
become
galvanized
into
life
and
manifest
signs
of
intelligence
which
however
really
comes
from
the
mind
of
the
medium
at
some
seances
these
shells
manifest
and
materialize
and
talk
in
a
vague
meaningless
manner
the
shell
receiving
its
vitality
from
the
body
and
mind
of
the
medium
instead
of
speaking
from
any
consciousness
of
its
own
this
statement
is
not
to
be
taken
as
any
denial
of
true
spirit
return
but
is
merely
an
explanation
of
certain
forms
of
spiritualistic
phenomena
which
is
well
understood
by
advanced
spiritualists
although
many
seekers
after
psychic
phenomena
are
in
ignorance
of
it
question
vi
is
meant
by
the
days
and
nights
of
brahm
the
cycles
the
chain
of
worlds
etc
answer
in
lesson
sixth
of
the
present
series
you
will
find
a
brief
mention
of
the
days
and
nights
of
brahm
those
vast
periods
of
the
and
of
the
creative
principle
which
is
personified
in
the
hindu
conception
of
you
will
see
mentioned
there
that
universal
philosophical
conception
of
the
universal
rhythm
which
manifests
in
a
succession
of
periods
of
universal
activity
and
inactivity
the
yogi
teachings
are
that
all
time
is
manifested
in
cycles
man
calls
the
most
common
form
of
cyclic
time
by
the
name
of
a
day
which
is
the
period
of
time
necessary
for
the
earth
revolution
on
its
axis
each
day
is
a
reproduction
of
all
previous
days
although
the
incidents
of
each
day
differ
from
those
of
the
other
all
days
are
but
periods
of
time
marked
off
by
the
revolution
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
and
each
night
is
but
the
negative
side
of
a
day
the
positive
side
of
which
is
called
day
there
is
really
no
such
thing
as
a
day
that
which
we
call
a
day
being
simply
a
record
of
certain
physical
changes
in
the
earth
position
relating
to
its
own
axis
the
second
phase
of
cyclic
time
is
called
by
man
by
the
name
a
month
by
which
is
meant
certain
changes
in
the
relative
positions
of
the
moon
and
the
earth
the
true
month
consists
of
lunar
days
in
this
cycle
the
month
there
is
also
a
or
day
and
a
or
night
the
former
being
the
fourteen
days
of
the
visibility
and
the
second
being
the
fourteen
days
of
the
invisibility
the
third
phase
of
cyclic
time
is
that
which
we
call
a
year
by
which
is
meant
the
time
occupied
by
the
earth
in
its
revolution
around
the
sun
you
will
notice
that
the
year
has
its
positive
and
negative
periods
also
known
as
summer
and
winter
but
the
yogis
take
up
the
story
where
the
astronomers
drop
it
at
the
year
beyond
the
year
there
are
other
and
greater
phases
of
cyclic
time
the
yogis
know
many
cycles
of
thousands
of
years
in
which
there
are
marked
periods
of
activity
and
inactivity
we
can
not
go
into
detail
regarding
these
various
cycles
but
may
mention
another
division
common
to
the
yogi
teachings
beginning
with
the
great
year
the
great
year
is
composed
of
earth
years
twelve
thousand
great
years
constitute
what
is
known
as
a
great
cycle
which
is
seen
to
consist
of
earth
years
great
cycles
compose
what
is
called
a
at
the
end
of
which
the
earth
becomes
submerged
under
the
waters
until
not
a
vestige
of
land
is
left
uncovered
this
state
lasts
for
a
period
equal
to
great
cycles
a
is
composed
of
manwantaras
the
largest
and
grandest
cycle
manifested
is
known
as
the
consisting
of
when
the
absolute
withdraws
into
itself
its
entire
manifestations
and
dwells
alone
in
its
awful
infinity
and
oneness
this
period
being
succeeded
by
a
period
equally
long
the
two
being
known
as
the
days
and
nights
of
brahm
you
will
notice
that
each
of
these
great
cycles
has
its
day
period
and
its
night
period
its
period
of
activity
and
its
period
of
inactivity
from
day
to
it
is
a
succession
of
nights
and
days
creative
activity
and
creative
cessation
the
chain
of
worlds
is
that
great
group
of
planets
in
our
own
solar
system
seven
in
number
over
which
the
procession
of
life
passes
in
cycles
from
globe
to
globe
the
great
wave
of
soul
life
passes
in
cyclic
rhythm
after
a
race
has
passed
a
certain
number
of
incarnations
upon
one
planet
it
passes
on
to
another
and
learns
new
lessons
and
then
on
and
on
until
finally
it
has
learned
all
of
the
lessons
possible
on
this
universe
when
it
passes
on
to
another
universe
and
so
on
from
higher
to
higher
until
the
human
mind
is
unable
to
even
think
of
the
grandeur
of
the
destiny
awaiting
each
human
soul
on
the
path
the
various
works
published
by
the
theosophical
organizations
go
into
detail
regarding
these
matters
which
require
the
space
of
many
volumes
to
adequately
express
but
we
think
that
we
have
at
last
indicated
the
general
nature
of
the
question
pointing
out
to
the
student
the
nature
of
the
subject
and
indicating
lines
for
further
study
and
investigation
conclusion
and
now
dear
students
we
have
reached
the
end
of
this
series
of
lessons
you
have
followed
us
closely
for
the
past
four
years
many
of
you
having
been
with
us
as
students
from
the
start
we
feel
many
ties
of
spiritual
relationship
binding
you
to
us
and
the
parting
although
but
temporary
gives
a
little
pang
to
us
a
little
pull
upon
our
heart
strings
we
have
tried
to
give
to
you
a
plain
practical
and
simple
exposition
of
the
great
truths
of
this
philosophy
have
endeavored
to
express
in
plain
simple
terms
the
greatest
truths
known
to
man
on
earth
yogi
and
many
have
written
us
that
our
work
has
not
been
in
vain
and
that
we
have
been
the
means
of
opening
up
new
worlds
of
thought
to
them
and
have
aided
them
in
casting
off
the
old
material
sheaths
that
had
bound
them
for
so
long
and
the
discarding
of
which
enabled
them
to
unfold
the
beautiful
blossom
of
spirituality
be
this
as
it
may
we
have
been
able
merely
to
give
you
the
most
elementary
instruction
in
this
and
are
painfully
conscious
of
the
small
portion
of
the
field
that
we
have
tilled
when
compared
with
the
infinite
expanse
of
truth
still
untouched
but
such
are
the
limitations
of
man
he
can
speak
only
of
that
which
lies
immediately
before
him
leaving
for
others
the
rest
of
the
work
which
is
remote
from
his
place
of
abode
there
are
planes
upon
planes
of
this
truth
which
every
soul
among
you
will
some
day
make
his
or
her
own
it
is
yours
and
you
will
be
impelled
to
reach
forth
and
take
that
which
is
intended
for
you
be
not
in
too
much
haste
be
of
great
patience
and
all
will
come
to
you
for
it
is
your
own
mystic
christianity
we
have
here
to
make
an
announcement
that
will
please
our
readers
judging
from
the
many
letters
that
we
have
received
during
the
several
years
of
our
work
we
will
now
enter
upon
a
new
phase
of
our
work
of
presenting
the
great
truths
underlying
life
as
taught
by
the
great
minds
of
centuries
ago
and
carefully
transmitted
from
master
to
student
from
that
time
unto
our
own
we
have
concluded
our
presentation
of
the
mystic
teachings
underlying
the
hindu
philosophies
and
shall
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
and
presentation
of
the
great
mystic
principles
underlying
that
great
and
glorious
creed
of
the
western
world
the
religion
teachings
and
philosophy
of
jesus
the
christ
these
teachings
too
as
we
should
remember
are
essentially
eastern
in
their
origin
and
source
although
their
effects
are
more
pronounced
in
the
western
world
underlying
the
teaching
and
philosophy
of
the
christ
are
to
be
found
the
same
esoteric
principles
that
underlie
the
other
great
systems
of
philosophies
of
the
east
covered
up
though
the
truth
be
by
the
additions
of
the
western
churches
and
sects
still
it
remains
there
burning
brightly
as
ever
and
plainly
visible
to
one
who
will
brush
aside
the
rubbish
surrounding
the
sacred
flame
and
who
will
seek
beneath
the
forms
and
for
the
mystic
truths
underlying
christianity
we
realize
the
importance
of
the
work
before
us
but
we
shrink
not
from
the
task
for
we
know
that
when
the
bright
light
of
the
spirit
which
is
found
as
the
centre
of
the
christian
philosophy
is
uncovered
there
will
be
great
rejoicing
from
the
many
who
while
believing
in
and
realizing
the
value
of
the
eastern
teachings
still
rightly
hold
their
love
devotion
and
admiration
for
him
who
was
in
very
truth
the
son
of
god
and
whose
mission
was
to
raise
the
world
spiritually
from
the
material
quagmire
into
which
it
was
stumbling
and
now
dear
pupils
we
must
close
this
series
of
lessons
on
the
yogi
philosophy
we
must
rest
ere
we
so
soon
engage
upon
our
new
and
great
work
we
must
each
take
a
little
rest
ere
we
meet
again
on
the
path
of
attainment
each
of
these
temporary
partings
are
milestones
upon
our
journey
of
spiritual
life
let
each
find
us
farther
advanced
and
now
we
send
you
our
wishes
of
peace
may
the
peace
be
with
you
all
now
and
forever
even
unto
nirvana
which
is
peace
