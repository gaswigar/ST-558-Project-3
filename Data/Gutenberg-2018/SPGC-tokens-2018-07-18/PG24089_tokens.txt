the
discovery
my
dear
jane
you
remember
that
you
were
puzzled
when
i
told
you
i
had
heard
something
from
the
owls
or
if
not
puzzled
for
i
know
you
have
some
experience
of
these
things
you
were
at
any
rate
anxious
to
know
exactly
how
it
happened
perhaps
the
time
has
now
come
for
you
to
be
told
it
was
really
luck
and
not
any
skill
of
mine
that
put
me
in
the
way
of
it
luck
and
also
being
ready
to
believe
more
than
i
could
see
i
have
promised
not
to
put
down
on
paper
the
name
of
the
wood
where
it
happened
that
can
keep
till
we
meet
but
all
the
rest
i
can
tell
exactly
as
it
came
about
it
is
a
wood
with
a
stream
at
the
edge
of
it
the
water
is
brown
and
clear
on
the
other
side
of
it
are
flat
meadows
and
beyond
these
a
hillside
quite
covered
with
an
oak
wood
the
stream
has
along
it
and
is
pretty
well
shaded
over
the
sun
hits
it
in
places
and
makes
flecks
of
light
through
the
leaves
the
day
i
am
thinking
of
was
a
very
hot
one
in
early
september
i
had
come
across
the
meadows
with
some
idea
of
sitting
by
the
stream
and
reading
the
only
change
in
my
plans
that
i
made
was
that
instead
of
sitting
down
i
lay
down
and
instead
of
reading
i
went
to
sleep
you
know
how
sometimes
but
very
very
seldom
you
see
something
in
a
dream
which
you
are
quite
sure
is
real
so
it
was
with
me
this
time
i
did
not
dream
any
story
or
see
any
people
i
only
dreamt
of
a
plant
in
the
dream
no
one
told
me
anything
about
it
i
just
saw
it
growing
under
a
tree
a
small
bit
of
the
tree
root
came
into
the
picture
an
old
gnarled
root
covered
with
moss
and
with
three
sorts
of
eyes
in
it
round
holes
trimmed
with
moss
you
know
the
kind
the
plant
was
not
one
i
should
have
thought
much
about
though
certainly
it
was
not
one
that
i
knew
it
had
no
flowers
or
berries
and
grew
quite
squat
in
the
ground
more
like
a
yellow
aconite
without
the
flower
than
anything
else
it
seemed
to
consist
of
a
ring
of
six
leaves
spread
out
pretty
flat
with
nine
points
on
each
leaf
as
i
say
i
saw
this
quite
clearly
and
remembered
it
because
six
times
nine
makes
which
happens
to
be
a
number
which
i
had
a
particular
reason
for
remembering
at
that
moment
well
there
was
no
more
in
the
dream
than
that
but
such
as
it
was
it
fixed
itself
in
my
mind
like
a
photograph
and
i
was
sure
that
if
ever
i
saw
that
tree
root
and
that
plant
i
should
know
them
again
and
though
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
more
of
them
than
i
have
told
you
it
was
borne
in
upon
my
mind
that
the
plant
worth
finding
when
i
woke
up
i
still
lay
feeling
very
lazy
on
the
grass
with
my
head
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
edge
of
the
stream
and
listened
to
its
noise
until
in
five
or
six
minutes
whether
i
began
to
doze
off
again
or
not
does
not
much
matter
the
became
like
words
and
said
an
immense
number
of
times
it
pleased
me
for
though
in
poetry
we
hear
a
deal
about
babbling
brooks
and
though
i
am
particularly
fond
of
the
noise
they
make
i
never
was
able
before
to
pretend
that
i
could
hear
any
words
and
when
i
did
finally
get
up
and
shake
myself
awake
i
thought
i
would
anyhow
pay
so
much
attention
to
what
the
water
said
as
to
stroll
up
the
stream
instead
of
down
so
i
did
it
took
me
through
the
flat
meadows
but
still
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
still
every
now
and
then
i
heard
the
same
peculiar
noise
which
sounded
like
not
so
very
long
after
i
came
to
a
place
where
another
stream
ran
out
of
the
wood
into
the
one
i
had
been
following
and
just
below
the
place
where
the
two
joined
there
was
not
a
bridge
but
a
pole
across
and
another
pole
to
serve
as
a
rail
by
which
you
could
cross
without
trouble
i
did
cross
not
thinking
much
about
it
but
with
some
idea
of
looking
at
this
new
little
stream
which
went
at
a
very
quick
pace
and
seemed
to
promise
small
rapids
and
waterfalls
a
little
higher
up
now
when
i
got
to
the
edge
of
it
there
was
no
mistake
it
was
saying
or
even
much
plainer
than
the
old
one
i
stepped
across
it
and
went
a
few
yards
up
the
old
stream
before
the
new
one
joined
it
it
was
saying
nothing
of
the
kind
i
went
back
to
the
new
one
it
was
talking
as
plain
as
print
of
course
there
were
no
two
words
about
what
must
be
done
now
here
was
something
quite
new
and
even
if
i
missed
my
tea
it
had
got
to
be
looked
into
so
i
went
up
the
new
stream
into
the
wood
though
i
was
well
on
the
for
unusual
things
in
particular
the
plant
which
i
could
not
help
thinking
about
i
can
not
say
there
was
anything
peculiar
about
the
stream
or
the
plants
or
the
insects
or
the
trees
except
the
words
which
the
water
kept
saying
so
long
as
i
was
in
the
flat
part
of
the
wood
but
soon
i
came
to
a
steepish
bank
the
land
began
to
slope
up
suddenly
and
the
rapids
and
waterfalls
of
the
brook
were
very
gay
and
interesting
then
besides
which
was
now
its
word
always
instead
of
i
heard
every
now
and
then
which
was
encouraging
and
exciting
still
there
was
nothing
out
of
the
way
to
be
seen
look
as
i
might
the
climb
up
the
slope
or
bank
was
fairly
long
at
the
top
was
a
kind
of
terrace
pretty
level
and
with
large
old
trees
growing
upon
it
mainly
oaks
behind
there
was
a
further
slope
up
and
still
more
woodland
but
that
does
not
matter
now
for
the
present
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
wanderings
there
was
no
more
stream
and
i
had
found
what
of
all
natural
things
i
think
pleases
me
best
a
real
spring
of
water
quite
untouched
five
or
six
oaks
grew
in
something
like
a
semicircle
and
in
the
middle
of
the
flat
ground
in
front
of
them
was
an
almost
perfectly
round
pool
not
more
than
four
or
five
feet
across
the
bottom
of
it
in
the
middle
was
pale
sand
which
was
continually
rising
up
in
little
mounds
and
falling
down
again
it
was
the
clearest
and
strongest
spring
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
could
have
watched
it
for
hours
i
did
sit
down
by
it
and
watch
it
for
some
time
without
thinking
of
anything
but
the
luck
i
had
had
to
find
it
but
then
i
began
to
wonder
if
it
would
say
anything
naturally
i
could
not
expect
it
to
say
any
more
for
here
i
was
at
the
end
of
it
so
i
listened
with
some
curiosity
it
hardly
made
so
much
noise
as
the
stream
the
pool
was
deeper
but
i
thought
it
must
say
something
and
i
put
my
head
down
as
close
as
i
could
to
the
surface
of
the
water
if
i
am
not
mistaken
and
as
things
turned
out
i
am
sure
i
was
right
the
words
were
gather
pick
or
now
i
had
not
been
thinking
about
the
plant
for
a
little
time
but
as
you
may
suppose
this
brought
it
back
to
my
mind
and
i
got
up
and
began
to
look
about
at
the
roots
of
the
old
oaks
which
grew
just
round
the
spring
no
none
of
the
roots
on
this
side
which
faced
towards
the
water
were
like
that
which
i
had
seen
still
the
feeling
was
strong
upon
me
that
this
if
any
was
the
kind
of
place
and
even
the
very
place
where
the
plant
must
be
so
i
walked
to
the
back
of
the
trees
being
careful
to
go
from
right
to
left
according
to
the
course
of
the
sun
well
i
was
not
mistaken
at
the
back
of
the
middlemost
there
were
the
roots
i
had
dreamt
of
with
the
moss
and
the
holes
like
eyes
and
between
them
was
the
plant
i
think
the
only
thing
which
was
new
to
me
in
the
look
of
it
was
that
it
was
so
extraordinarily
it
seemed
to
have
in
it
all
the
greenness
that
was
possible
or
that
would
be
wanted
for
a
whole
field
of
grass
i
had
some
scruples
about
touching
it
in
fact
i
actually
went
back
to
the
spring
and
listened
to
make
sure
that
it
was
still
saying
the
same
thing
yes
it
was
gather
but
there
was
something
else
every
now
and
then
which
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
make
out
at
first
i
lay
down
put
my
hand
round
my
ear
and
held
my
breath
it
might
have
been
or
or
i
got
impatient
at
last
and
said
well
i
very
sorry
but
do
what
i
will
i
make
out
what
you
are
trying
to
say
instantly
a
little
spirt
of
water
hit
me
on
the
ear
and
i
heard
as
clear
as
possible
what
it
was
i
got
up
at
once
i
your
pardon
i
said
of
course
thank
you
very
much
and
the
water
went
on
saying
gather
all
right
dip
after
thinking
how
best
to
greet
it
i
went
back
to
the
oak
stood
in
front
of
it
and
said
of
course
baring
my
head
oak
i
humbly
desire
your
good
leave
to
gather
the
green
plant
which
grows
between
your
roots
if
an
acorn
falls
into
this
my
right
hand
which
i
held
out
i
will
count
it
that
you
answer
yes
and
give
you
thanks
the
acorn
fell
straight
into
the
palm
of
my
hand
i
said
i
thank
you
oak
good
growth
to
you
i
will
lay
this
your
acorn
in
the
place
whence
i
gather
the
plant
then
very
carefully
i
took
hold
of
the
stalk
of
the
plant
which
was
very
short
for
as
i
said
it
grew
rather
flat
on
the
ground
and
pulled
and
to
my
surprise
it
came
up
as
easily
as
a
mushroom
it
had
a
clean
round
bulb
without
any
rootlets
and
left
a
smooth
neat
hole
in
the
ground
in
which
according
to
promise
i
laid
the
acorn
and
covered
it
in
with
earth
i
think
it
very
likely
that
it
will
turn
into
a
second
plant
then
i
remembered
the
last
word
of
the
spring
and
went
back
to
dip
the
plant
in
it
i
had
a
shock
when
i
did
so
and
it
was
lucky
i
was
holding
it
firm
for
when
it
touched
the
water
it
struggled
in
my
hand
like
a
fish
or
a
newt
and
almost
slipped
out
i
dipped
it
three
times
and
thought
i
felt
it
growing
smaller
in
my
hand
and
indeed
when
i
looked
at
it
i
found
it
had
shut
up
its
leaves
and
curled
them
in
quite
close
so
that
the
whole
thing
was
little
more
than
a
bulb
as
i
looked
at
it
i
thought
the
water
changed
its
note
and
said
do
that
i
thought
it
was
time
to
thank
the
spring
for
all
it
had
done
for
me
though
as
you
may
suppose
i
did
not
yet
know
in
the
least
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
plant
or
what
use
it
was
going
to
be
so
i
went
over
and
said
in
the
politest
words
i
could
how
much
i
was
obliged
and
if
there
was
anything
i
had
or
could
do
which
would
be
agreeable
how
glad
i
should
be
then
i
listened
carefully
for
it
seemed
by
this
time
quite
natural
that
i
should
get
some
sort
of
answer
it
came
there
was
a
sudden
change
in
the
sound
and
the
water
said
clearly
and
rapidly
silver
silver
i
felt
in
my
pocket
luckily
i
had
several
shillings
sixpences
and
i
thought
the
best
way
was
to
offer
them
all
so
i
put
them
in
the
palm
of
my
right
hand
and
held
it
under
the
water
open
just
over
the
dancing
sand
for
a
few
seconds
the
water
ran
over
the
silver
without
doing
anything
only
the
coins
seemed
to
grow
very
bright
and
clean
then
one
of
the
shillings
was
very
neatly
and
smoothly
slid
off
and
then
another
and
a
sixpence
i
waited
but
no
more
happened
and
the
water
seemed
to
draw
itself
down
and
away
from
my
hand
and
to
say
so
i
got
up
the
three
coins
lay
on
the
bottom
of
the
pool
looking
brighter
than
even
the
newest
i
have
ever
seen
and
gradually
as
they
lay
there
they
began
to
appear
larger
the
shillings
looked
like
and
the
sixpence
like
a
shilling
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
it
was
because
water
magnifies
but
i
soon
saw
that
this
could
not
be
the
reason
for
they
went
on
growing
larger
and
of
course
thinner
until
they
finally
spread
into
a
kind
of
silver
film
all
over
the
bottom
of
the
pool
and
as
they
did
so
the
water
began
to
take
on
a
musical
sound
much
like
the
singing
that
comes
when
you
wet
your
finger
and
draw
it
round
the
edge
of
a
finger
glass
at
dessert
which
some
people
idea
of
table
manners
allows
them
to
do
it
was
a
pretty
sight
and
sound
and
i
listened
and
looked
for
a
long
time
but
all
this
time
what
had
become
of
the
plant
why
when
i
gave
the
silver
to
the
spring
i
had
wrapped
the
plant
carefully
in
a
silk
handkerchief
and
put
it
safe
in
my
breast
pocket
i
took
the
handkerchief
out
now
and
for
a
moment
i
was
afraid
the
plant
was
gone
but
it
was
not
it
had
shrunk
to
a
very
small
ball
now
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
or
rather
what
could
it
do
it
was
plain
to
me
that
it
must
have
a
strange
and
valuable
property
or
virtue
since
i
had
been
put
on
its
track
in
such
a
remarkable
way
i
thought
i
could
not
do
better
than
ask
the
spring
i
said
o
spring
of
water
have
i
your
good
leave
to
ask
what
i
should
do
with
this
precious
plant
to
put
it
to
the
best
use
the
silver
lining
of
the
spring
made
its
words
much
easier
to
catch
when
it
said
anything
for
i
should
tell
you
that
for
the
most
part
now
it
did
not
speak
or
not
in
any
language
that
i
could
understand
but
rather
sang
and
it
now
said
swallow
drink
obedience
dear
jane
has
always
been
my
motto
as
it
is
doubtless
yours
and
i
at
once
laid
myself
down
drank
a
mouthful
of
water
from
the
spring
and
put
the
little
bulb
in
my
mouth
it
instantly
grew
soft
and
slipped
down
my
throat
how
prosaic
i
have
no
idea
what
it
tasted
like
and
again
i
addressed
the
spring
is
there
anything
more
for
me
to
do
no
no
no
you
see
you
see
was
the
answer
which
came
at
once
accordingly
i
once
more
thanked
the
spring
wished
it
clear
water
no
mud
no
tramplings
of
cattle
and
bade
it
farewell
but
i
said
i
should
hope
to
visit
it
again
then
i
turned
away
and
looked
about
me
wondering
whether
now
that
i
had
swallowed
the
mysterious
plant
i
should
see
anything
different
the
only
thing
i
noticed
was
due
i
suppose
not
to
the
plant
but
to
the
spring
but
it
was
odd
enough
all
the
trees
hard
by
were
crowded
with
little
birds
of
all
kinds
sitting
in
rows
on
the
branches
as
they
do
on
telegraph
wires
i
have
no
doubt
they
were
listening
to
the
silver
bell
in
the
spring
they
were
quite
still
and
did
not
take
any
notice
when
i
began
to
walk
away
i
said
you
will
remember
that
the
ground
i
was
on
was
a
sort
of
flat
terrace
at
the
top
of
a
steep
slope
now
at
one
end
this
terrace
just
went
down
into
the
wood
but
at
the
other
end
there
was
a
little
mound
or
hillock
with
thick
underwood
behind
it
i
felt
a
curiosity
an
inclination
to
walk
that
way
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
the
plant
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
as
i
walked
i
looked
at
the
ground
and
noticed
a
curious
thing
the
roots
of
the
plants
and
grasses
seemed
to
show
more
than
i
was
accustomed
to
see
them
it
was
not
a
great
way
to
the
hillock
when
i
got
to
it
i
wondered
why
i
had
gone
for
there
was
nothing
odd
about
it
still
i
stepped
on
to
the
top
and
then
i
did
see
something
namely
a
square
flat
stone
just
in
front
of
my
feet
i
poked
at
it
with
my
but
somehow
i
did
not
seem
to
touch
it
nor
was
there
any
scraping
noise
this
was
funny
i
tried
again
and
now
i
saw
that
my
stick
was
not
touching
it
at
all
there
was
something
in
between
i
felt
with
my
hands
and
they
met
with
what
seemed
like
grass
and
earth
certainly
not
like
stone
i
understood
the
plant
was
the
one
which
makes
you
able
to
see
what
is
under
the
ground
i
need
not
tell
you
all
i
thought
or
how
surprising
and
delightful
it
was
the
first
thing
was
to
get
at
the
flat
stone
and
find
out
what
was
underneath
it
accordingly
what
with
a
knife
and
what
with
my
fingers
i
soon
had
it
uncovered
it
was
four
or
five
inches
under
the
surface
there
were
no
marks
on
it
it
measured
more
than
a
foot
each
way
i
lifted
it
it
was
the
cover
of
a
sort
of
box
with
bottom
and
sides
each
made
of
a
slab
just
like
the
lid
in
this
box
was
another
made
of
some
dark
metal
which
i
took
to
be
lead
i
pulled
it
out
and
found
that
the
lid
of
the
box
was
all
of
one
piece
with
the
rest
like
a
sardine
tin
evidently
i
could
not
open
it
there
and
then
it
was
rather
heavy
but
i
did
not
care
and
i
managed
without
too
much
inconvenience
to
carry
it
home
to
the
place
i
was
lodging
in
of
course
i
put
back
the
stone
neatly
and
covered
it
up
with
earth
and
grass
again
i
was
late
for
tea
but
i
had
found
what
was
better
than
tea
ii
the
first
jar
that
night
i
waited
till
the
moon
was
up
before
trying
to
open
the
box
i
do
not
well
know
why
but
it
seemed
the
right
thing
and
i
followed
my
instinct
feeling
that
it
might
be
the
plant
that
made
me
think
as
i
did
i
drew
up
the
blind
and
laid
the
box
on
a
table
near
the
window
where
the
moon
shone
full
on
it
and
waited
to
see
if
anything
else
occurred
to
me
suddenly
i
heard
a
sort
of
metallic
snap
i
went
and
looked
at
the
box
nothing
appeared
on
the
side
nearest
to
me
but
when
i
turned
it
round
i
saw
that
all
along
the
side
which
the
moon
had
shone
upon
there
was
a
line
along
the
metal
i
turned
another
side
to
the
moonlight
and
another
snap
came
in
two
or
three
minutes
of
course
i
went
on
when
the
moon
had
made
a
groove
on
all
four
sides
i
tried
the
lid
it
would
not
come
off
yet
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
continue
the
process
three
times
i
did
it
every
side
i
turned
to
the
moon
thrice
and
when
that
was
done
the
lid
was
free
i
lifted
it
and
what
did
i
see
in
the
box
all
this
writing
would
be
very
little
use
if
i
did
not
tell
you
so
it
must
be
done
there
were
five
compartments
in
the
box
in
each
of
them
was
a
little
jar
or
vase
of
glass
with
a
round
body
a
narrow
neck
and
spreading
out
a
little
at
the
top
the
top
of
each
was
covered
with
a
plate
of
metal
and
on
each
plate
was
a
word
or
two
in
capital
letters
on
the
one
in
the
middle
there
were
the
words
the
other
jars
had
one
word
apiece
now
years
ago
i
took
great
pains
to
learn
the
latin
language
and
on
many
occasions
i
have
found
it
whatever
you
may
see
to
the
contrary
in
the
newspaper
but
seldom
or
never
have
i
found
it
more
useful
than
now
i
saw
at
once
that
the
words
meant
the
what
would
be
the
result
of
my
doing
this
of
course
i
knew
no
more
than
you
but
i
was
pretty
sure
that
it
would
not
do
to
try
them
all
at
once
and
another
thing
i
felt
that
it
would
be
better
to
wait
till
next
day
before
trying
any
of
them
it
was
past
midnight
now
so
i
went
to
bed
but
first
i
locked
up
the
box
in
a
cupboard
for
i
did
not
want
anyone
to
see
it
as
yet
next
day
i
woke
bright
and
early
looked
at
my
watch
found
there
was
no
need
to
think
about
getting
up
yet
and
like
a
wise
creature
went
to
sleep
again
i
mention
this
not
merely
by
way
of
being
jocose
but
because
after
i
went
to
sleep
i
had
a
dream
which
most
likely
came
from
the
plant
and
certainly
had
to
do
with
the
box
i
seemed
to
see
a
room
or
to
be
in
a
room
about
which
i
only
noticed
that
the
floor
was
paved
with
mosaic
in
a
pattern
mostly
red
and
white
that
there
were
no
pictures
on
the
walls
and
no
fireplace
no
sashes
or
indeed
panes
in
the
window
and
the
moon
was
shining
in
very
bright
there
was
a
table
and
a
chest
then
i
saw
an
old
man
rather
badly
shaved
and
bald
in
a
roman
dress
white
for
the
most
part
with
a
purple
stripe
somewhere
and
sandals
he
looked
by
no
means
a
wicked
or
designing
old
man
i
was
glad
of
that
he
opened
the
chest
took
out
my
box
and
placed
it
carefully
on
the
table
in
the
moonlight
then
he
went
to
a
part
of
the
room
i
could
not
see
and
i
heard
a
sound
of
water
being
poured
into
a
metal
basin
and
he
came
into
sight
again
wiping
his
hands
on
a
white
towel
he
opened
the
box
took
out
a
little
silver
spoon
and
one
of
the
jars
took
off
the
lid
and
dipped
the
spoon
in
the
jar
and
touched
first
his
right
eye
and
then
his
left
with
it
then
he
put
the
jar
and
the
spoon
back
laid
the
lid
on
the
box
and
put
it
back
in
the
chest
after
that
he
went
to
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
and
seemed
to
be
very
much
amused
with
what
he
saw
that
was
all
hints
for
me
i
remember
thinking
perhaps
it
will
be
best
not
to
touch
the
box
before
the
moon
is
up
and
always
with
washed
hands
i
suppose
i
woke
up
immediately
for
it
was
all
very
fresh
in
my
mind
when
i
did
it
was
something
of
a
disappointment
to
have
to
put
off
my
experiments
till
the
night
came
round
but
it
was
all
for
the
best
for
letters
came
by
the
post
which
i
had
to
attend
to
in
fact
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
the
town
a
little
way
off
to
see
someone
and
to
send
telegrams
and
so
on
i
was
a
little
doubtful
about
the
seeing
things
underground
but
i
soon
found
that
unless
i
so
to
say
turned
on
the
tap
and
specially
wished
and
tried
to
use
the
power
it
did
not
interfere
with
my
ordinary
seeing
when
i
did
it
seemed
to
come
forward
from
the
back
of
my
eyes
and
was
stronger
than
the
day
before
i
could
see
rabbits
in
their
burrows
and
followed
the
roots
of
one
very
deep
down
once
it
threatened
to
be
awkward
when
i
stooped
to
pick
up
a
silver
coin
in
the
street
and
grazed
my
knuckle
against
a
paving
stone
under
which
of
course
it
was
so
much
for
that
by
the
way
i
had
taken
a
look
at
the
box
after
breakfast
i
found
not
very
much
to
my
surprise
that
the
lid
was
as
tight
on
it
as
when
i
found
it
first
after
dinner
that
evening
i
put
out
the
light
the
moon
being
now
bright
placed
the
box
on
the
table
washed
my
hands
opened
it
and
shutting
my
eyes
put
my
hand
on
one
of
the
jars
at
random
and
took
it
out
as
i
had
rather
expected
i
heard
a
little
rattle
as
i
did
so
and
feeling
in
the
compartment
i
found
a
little
a
very
little
spoon
all
was
well
now
to
see
which
jar
chance
or
the
plant
had
chosen
for
my
first
experiment
i
took
it
to
the
window
it
was
the
one
marked
ears
and
the
spoon
had
on
the
handle
a
letter
i
opened
the
jar
the
lid
fitted
close
but
not
over
tightly
i
put
in
the
spoon
as
the
old
man
had
done
as
near
as
i
could
remember
it
brought
out
a
very
small
drop
of
thick
stuff
with
which
i
touched
first
my
right
ear
and
then
my
left
when
i
had
done
so
i
looked
at
the
spoon
it
was
perfectly
dry
i
put
it
and
the
jar
back
closed
the
box
locked
it
up
and
not
knowing
in
the
least
what
to
expect
went
to
the
open
window
and
put
my
head
out
for
some
little
time
i
heard
nothing
that
was
to
be
expected
and
i
was
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
distrust
the
jar
then
i
was
rewarded
a
bat
flew
by
and
i
who
have
not
heard
a
bat
even
squeak
these
twenty
years
now
heard
this
one
say
in
a
whistling
angry
tone
would
you
would
you
got
you
no
drat
drat
it
was
not
a
very
exciting
remark
but
it
was
enough
to
show
me
that
a
whole
new
world
as
the
books
say
was
open
to
me
this
of
course
was
only
a
beginning
there
were
some
plants
and
flowering
shrubs
under
the
window
and
though
i
could
see
nothing
i
began
to
hear
voices
two
voices
talking
among
them
they
sounded
young
of
course
they
were
anyhow
very
small
but
they
seemed
to
belong
to
young
creatures
of
their
kind
hullo
i
say
what
have
you
got
there
do
let
look
you
might
as
well
then
a
pause
another
voice
i
believe
it
a
bad
one
taste
it
after
another
pause
with
a
slight
sound
very
diminutive
of
spitting
heugh
bad
i
should
rather
think
it
was
maggot
after
laughing
rather
longer
than
i
thought
kind
look
here
do
chuck
it
away
let
give
it
to
the
old
man
here
shove
the
piece
in
again
and
rub
it
over
here
he
is
very
demurely
o
sir
we
got
such
a
could
not
catch
what
it
here
we
thought
you
might
perhaps
like
it
sir
would
you
sir
oh
no
thank
you
sir
we
had
plenty
sir
but
this
was
the
biggest
we
found
a
third
voice
said
something
it
was
a
deeper
one
and
less
easy
to
hear
bitten
sir
oh
no
i
do
think
so
do
you
name
which
i
did
not
make
why
how
could
it
be
again
angry
i
thought
rather
anxiously
but
sir
really
sir
i
do
much
like
them
must
i
really
sir
o
it
got
a
maggot
in
it
and
i
believe
they
poison
smack
smack
two
voices
very
lamentable
o
sir
please
sir
a
considerable
pause
and
sniffing
then
in
a
broken
voice
you
silly
fool
why
did
you
go
laughing
like
that
right
under
his
snout
you
might
have
known
he
cog
it
cog
i
had
not
heard
the
word
since
there
be
an
awful
row
look
here
i
shall
go
to
bed
the
voices
died
away
i
thought
seemed
to
be
apologizing
that
was
all
i
heard
night
after
eleven
things
seemed
to
get
very
still
and
i
began
to
feel
just
a
little
apprehensive
lest
something
of
a
less
innocent
kind
should
come
along
so
i
went
to
bed
iii
the
second
jar
next
day
i
must
say
was
very
amusing
i
spent
the
whole
of
it
in
the
fields
just
strolling
about
and
sitting
down
as
the
fancy
took
me
listening
to
what
went
on
in
the
trees
and
hedges
i
will
not
write
down
yet
the
kind
of
thing
i
heard
for
it
was
only
the
beginning
i
had
not
yet
found
out
the
way
of
using
the
new
power
to
the
very
best
advantage
i
felt
the
want
of
being
able
to
put
in
a
remark
or
a
question
of
my
own
every
now
and
then
but
i
was
pretty
sure
that
the
jar
which
had
on
it
would
manage
that
very
nearly
all
the
talking
i
heard
was
done
by
the
birds
and
animals
especially
the
birds
but
perhaps
half
a
dozen
times
as
i
sat
under
a
tree
or
walked
along
the
road
i
was
aware
of
voices
which
sounded
exactly
like
those
of
people
some
and
some
children
passing
by
or
coming
towards
me
and
talking
to
each
other
as
they
went
along
needless
to
say
there
was
nothing
to
be
no
movement
of
the
grass
and
no
track
on
the
dusty
road
even
when
i
could
tell
exactly
where
the
people
who
owned
the
voices
must
be
it
interested
me
more
than
anything
else
to
guess
what
sort
of
creatures
they
were
and
i
determined
that
the
next
jar
i
tried
should
be
the
eye
one
once
i
must
tell
you
i
ventured
to
say
good
afternoon
when
i
heard
a
couple
of
these
voices
within
a
yard
of
me
i
think
the
owners
must
nearly
have
had
a
fit
they
stopped
dead
one
of
them
gave
a
sort
of
cry
of
surprise
and
then
i
believe
they
ran
or
flew
away
i
felt
a
little
breath
of
wind
on
my
face
and
heard
no
more
it
was
as
i
know
now
that
they
could
see
me
but
they
felt
much
as
you
would
if
a
tree
or
a
cow
were
to
say
good
afternoon
to
you
when
i
was
at
supper
that
evening
the
cat
came
in
as
she
usually
did
to
see
what
was
going
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
think
that
cats
talk
when
they
mew
dogs
when
they
bark
and
so
on
it
is
not
so
at
all
their
talking
is
almost
all
done
except
when
they
are
in
a
great
state
of
mind
in
a
tone
which
you
can
not
possibly
hear
without
help
mewing
is
for
the
most
part
only
shouting
without
saying
any
words
purring
is
as
we
often
say
singing
well
this
cat
was
an
ordinary
nice
creature
tabby
and
in
she
came
and
sat
watching
me
while
i
had
soup
to
all
appearance
she
was
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
but
no
matter
for
that
what
she
was
saying
was
something
of
this
kind
get
on
with
it
do
shove
it
down
lap
it
up
who
cares
about
soup
get
to
business
i
know
there
fish
coming
when
the
fish
actually
came
there
was
a
great
deal
of
good
feeling
shown
at
first
oh
much
we
have
to
be
thankful
for
all
of
us
have
we
not
fish
fish
what
a
thought
dear
kind
generous
people
all
around
us
all
striving
to
supply
us
with
what
is
best
and
pleasantest
for
us
then
there
was
a
silence
for
a
short
time
then
in
a
somewhat
different
tone
i
heard
ah
dear
the
longer
i
live
the
wiser
i
find
it
is
not
to
expect
too
much
consideration
from
others
how
few
how
terribly
few
are
really
free
from
it
the
nature
that
knows
how
to
take
a
hint
how
rare
it
is
another
short
silence
and
then
there
you
go
another
great
bit
i
wonder
you
do
choke
or
burst
disgusting
a
good
scratch
all
down
your
horrible
fat
cheek
is
what
you
want
and
i
know
some
cats
that
would
give
it
you
no
more
notion
how
to
behave
than
a
cockroach
about
this
time
i
rang
the
bell
and
the
fish
was
taken
away
the
cat
went
too
circling
round
the
maid
with
trusting
and
childlike
glances
and
i
heard
her
saying
in
the
former
tone
well
i
daresay
after
all
there
are
kind
hearts
in
the
world
some
that
can
feel
for
a
poor
weary
creature
and
know
what
a
deal
of
strength
and
nourishment
even
the
least
bit
of
fish
can
give
and
i
lost
the
rest
when
the
time
came
and
the
box
was
open
once
more
i
duly
anointed
my
eyes
and
went
to
the
window
i
knew
something
of
what
i
might
expect
to
see
but
i
had
not
realized
at
all
how
much
of
it
there
would
be
in
the
first
place
there
were
a
great
many
buildings
in
fact
a
regular
village
all
about
the
little
lawn
on
which
my
window
looked
they
were
of
course
not
big
perhaps
three
feet
high
was
the
largest
size
the
roofs
seemed
to
be
of
tiles
the
walls
were
white
the
windows
were
brightly
lighted
and
i
could
see
people
moving
about
inside
but
there
were
plenty
of
people
outside
too
people
about
six
inches
high
walking
about
standing
about
talking
running
playing
some
game
which
might
have
been
hockey
these
were
on
levelled
spaces
for
the
grass
neatly
kept
as
it
was
would
have
come
up
their
legs
and
there
were
some
driving
along
smooth
tracks
in
carriages
drawn
by
horses
of
the
right
size
which
were
really
the
most
charming
little
animals
i
ever
saw
you
may
suppose
that
i
should
not
soon
have
got
tired
of
watching
them
and
listening
to
the
little
treble
buzz
of
voices
that
went
on
but
i
was
interrupted
just
in
front
of
me
i
heard
what
i
can
only
call
a
snigger
i
looked
down
and
saw
four
heads
supported
by
four
pairs
of
elbows
leaning
on
the
and
looking
up
at
me
they
belonged
to
four
boys
who
were
standing
on
the
twigs
of
a
bush
that
grew
up
against
the
wall
and
who
seemed
to
be
very
much
amused
every
now
and
again
one
of
them
nudged
another
and
pointed
towards
me
and
then
for
some
unexplained
reason
they
sniggered
again
i
felt
my
ears
growing
warm
and
red
well
young
gentlemen
i
said
you
seem
to
be
enjoying
yourselves
no
answer
i
appear
to
be
so
fortunate
as
to
afford
you
some
gratification
i
went
on
in
my
sarcastic
manner
perhaps
you
would
do
me
the
honour
of
stepping
into
my
poor
apartment
again
no
answer
but
more
undisguised
amusement
i
was
thinking
out
a
really
withering
remark
when
one
of
them
said
do
look
at
his
nose
i
wonder
if
they
know
how
ridiculous
they
are
i
like
to
talk
to
one
of
them
for
five
minutes
well
i
said
that
can
be
managed
very
easily
and
i
assure
you
i
should
be
equally
glad
of
the
opportunity
remarks
would
deal
with
the
subject
of
good
manners
another
one
spoke
this
time
but
did
not
answer
me
oh
i
do
know
he
said
i
expect
they
pretty
stupid
they
look
it
at
least
this
one
does
can
they
talk
said
the
third
i
never
heard
no
but
you
can
see
them
moving
their
jaws
and
mouths
and
things
this
one
did
just
now
i
saw
how
it
was
now
and
becoming
cooler
i
recognized
that
these
youths
were
behaving
very
much
as
i
might
have
done
myself
in
the
presence
of
someone
who
i
was
sure
could
neither
see
nor
hear
me
i
even
smiled
one
of
them
pointed
at
me
at
once
thought
of
a
joke
i
do
keep
it
all
to
yourself
old
chap
at
this
moment
the
fourth
who
had
not
said
anything
so
far
but
seemed
to
have
been
listening
piped
up
i
say
i
believe
i
know
what
it
is
that
makes
that
hammering
noise
it
something
he
has
got
in
his
clothes
i
could
not
resist
this
right
again
i
said
it
my
watch
and
you
very
welcome
to
look
at
it
and
i
took
it
out
and
put
it
on
the
an
awful
horror
and
surprise
came
into
their
faces
in
a
second
they
had
dived
down
like
so
many
ducks
in
another
second
i
saw
them
walking
across
the
grass
and
each
of
them
threw
his
arms
round
the
waist
or
the
neck
of
one
of
the
elder
people
who
were
walking
about
among
the
houses
the
person
so
attacked
pulled
himself
up
and
listened
attentively
to
what
the
boy
was
saying
the
particular
one
i
was
watching
looked
towards
my
window
and
then
burst
out
laughing
slapped
the
boy
on
the
back
and
resumed
his
walk
the
boy
went
slowly
off
towards
one
of
the
houses
one
or
two
of
the
other
men
came
and
stood
nearer
to
the
window
looking
up
i
thought
i
would
venture
a
bow
and
made
one
rather
ceremoniously
it
did
not
produce
much
effect
and
i
could
not
at
the
moment
think
of
anything
i
could
do
that
would
show
them
quite
clearly
that
i
saw
them
they
went
on
looking
at
me
quietly
enough
and
then
i
heard
a
deep
low
bell
seemingly
very
far
off
toll
five
times
they
heard
it
too
turned
sharply
round
and
walked
off
to
the
houses
soon
after
that
the
lights
in
the
windows
died
down
and
everything
became
very
still
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
ten
i
waited
for
a
while
to
see
if
anything
would
happen
but
there
was
nothing
so
i
got
some
books
out
which
took
a
few
minutes
and
before
i
settled
down
to
them
i
thought
i
would
just
take
one
more
look
out
of
the
window
where
were
all
the
little
houses
at
the
first
glance
i
thought
they
had
vanished
but
it
was
not
exactly
so
i
found
i
could
still
see
the
chimneys
above
the
grass
but
as
i
looked
they
too
disappeared
it
was
done
very
neatly
there
was
no
hole
the
turf
closed
in
upon
the
roofs
as
they
sank
down
just
as
if
it
was
of
there
was
not
a
trace
left
of
houses
or
roads
or
playgrounds
or
anything
i
was
strongly
tempted
to
go
out
and
walk
over
the
site
of
the
village
but
i
did
not
for
one
thing
i
was
afraid
i
might
disturb
the
people
of
the
house
and
besides
there
was
a
mist
coming
up
over
the
meadows
which
sloped
away
outside
the
garden
so
i
stopped
where
i
was
but
what
a
very
odd
mist
i
began
to
think
it
was
not
coming
in
all
in
one
piece
as
it
should
it
was
more
in
patches
or
even
pillars
of
a
smoky
grey
which
moved
at
different
rates
some
of
them
occasionally
standing
still
others
even
seeming
to
go
to
and
fro
and
now
i
began
to
hear
something
like
a
hollow
whispering
coming
from
their
direction
it
was
not
conversation
for
it
went
on
quite
continuously
in
the
same
tone
it
sounded
more
as
if
something
was
being
recited
i
did
not
like
it
then
i
saw
what
i
liked
less
seven
of
these
pillars
of
mist
each
about
the
size
of
a
man
were
standing
in
a
row
just
outside
the
garden
fence
and
in
each
i
thought
i
saw
two
dull
red
eyes
and
the
hollow
whispering
grew
louder
just
then
i
heard
a
noise
behind
me
in
the
room
as
if
the
had
suddenly
fallen
down
so
they
had
and
the
reason
why
they
had
was
that
an
old
horseshoe
which
was
on
the
mantelpiece
had
for
no
reason
that
i
could
see
tumbled
over
and
knocked
them
something
i
had
heard
came
into
my
mind
i
took
the
horseshoe
and
laid
it
on
the
the
pillars
of
mist
swayed
and
quivered
as
if
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
had
struck
them
and
seemed
all
at
once
to
go
farther
off
and
the
hollow
murmur
was
no
longer
to
be
heard
i
shut
the
window
and
went
to
bed
but
the
last
thing
i
looked
out
once
again
the
meadow
was
clear
of
mist
and
bright
beneath
the
light
of
the
moon
as
i
lay
in
bed
i
thought
and
thought
over
what
i
had
seen
last
i
was
quite
sure
that
the
pillars
of
mist
concealed
some
beings
who
wished
me
no
good
but
why
should
they
have
any
spite
against
me
i
was
also
sure
that
they
wanted
to
get
into
the
house
but
again
why
you
may
think
i
was
slow
in
the
wits
but
i
must
confess
that
some
few
minutes
passed
before
i
guessed
of
course
they
wanted
to
get
hold
of
the
box
with
the
five
jars
the
thought
disturbed
me
so
much
that
i
got
up
lighted
a
candle
and
went
to
the
cupboard
to
see
if
all
was
safe
yes
the
box
was
there
but
the
cupboard
door
which
i
knew
i
had
locked
was
unfastened
and
when
i
had
to
turn
the
key
it
became
plain
that
the
lock
was
hampered
and
useless
how
could
this
have
come
about
earlier
in
the
evening
it
had
been
perfectly
right
and
nobody
had
been
in
the
room
since
i
locked
it
last
whoever
had
done
it
they
had
made
the
cupboard
no
safe
place
for
the
box
i
took
it
into
the
bedroom
and
after
a
minute
thought
cleared
out
a
space
in
a
which
i
had
brought
with
me
locked
it
in
that
and
put
the
key
on
the
ring
of
my
watch
and
all
went
under
my
pillow
and
once
more
i
got
into
bed
iv
the
small
people
you
will
have
made
sure
that
the
next
jar
i
meant
to
try
was
the
one
for
the
tongue
in
hopes
that
it
would
help
me
to
speak
to
some
of
the
creatures
though
i
looked
forward
to
the
experiment
very
much
and
felt
somewhat
restless
until
i
had
made
it
i
did
get
a
good
deal
of
amusement
out
of
what
i
saw
and
heard
the
next
day
the
small
people
were
not
to
be
seen
at
least
not
in
the
morning
no
i
am
wrong
i
found
a
bunch
of
three
of
them
young
ones
asleep
in
a
hollow
tree
they
woke
up
and
looked
at
me
without
much
interest
and
when
i
was
withdrawing
my
head
they
blew
kisses
to
me
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
doubt
they
did
so
in
derision
but
there
were
others
i
passed
a
cottage
garden
in
which
a
little
dog
was
barking
most
furiously
it
seemed
to
be
barking
at
a
on
which
with
a
lot
of
other
things
was
a
print
dress
with
rather
a
staring
pattern
of
flowers
the
dress
caught
my
eye
and
so
did
something
red
at
the
top
which
stuck
up
above
the
line
i
gave
it
another
glance
and
really
i
had
a
most
dreadful
shock
it
was
a
face
i
gazed
at
it
in
horror
and
was
just
gathering
my
wits
to
run
and
call
for
help
or
something
when
i
saw
that
it
was
laughing
then
i
realized
that
it
could
not
be
an
ordinary
person
hanging
as
it
was
on
a
thin
bit
of
cord
and
blowing
to
and
fro
in
the
breeze
i
went
nearer
staring
at
it
with
all
my
eyes
and
made
out
that
it
was
the
face
of
an
old
woman
very
cheerful
and
ruddy
and
as
i
said
laughing
and
swinging
to
and
fro
suddenly
she
seemed
to
catch
my
eye
and
to
see
that
i
saw
her
and
in
a
flash
she
was
off
the
line
and
round
the
corner
of
the
house
nearly
tumbling
over
the
dog
as
she
went
it
rushed
after
her
still
very
angry
but
soon
came
trotting
back
rather
out
of
breath
and
incident
was
over
i
walked
on
among
the
village
people
i
met
there
were
one
or
two
whom
i
did
think
i
had
seen
before
elderly
people
they
were
who
seemed
very
much
surprised
when
i
said
good
morning
to
them
and
stopped
still
looking
after
me
when
i
passed
on
at
last
some
little
way
outside
the
village
i
saw
in
the
distance
the
same
dress
that
had
been
on
the
the
person
who
wore
it
was
going
slowly
and
looking
in
the
grass
and
hedges
and
sometimes
stooping
to
pick
a
plant
as
it
seemed
i
quickened
my
pace
and
came
up
with
her
and
when
i
was
just
behind
her
i
cleared
my
throat
rather
loudly
and
said
fine
day
or
words
to
that
effect
you
should
have
seen
her
jump
i
was
well
paid
for
the
fright
she
had
given
me
just
before
however
the
startled
look
cleared
away
from
her
face
and
she
drew
herself
up
and
looked
at
me
very
calmly
yes
she
said
it
a
fine
day
then
she
actually
blushed
and
went
on
i
think
i
ought
to
beg
your
pardon
for
giving
you
such
a
turn
just
now
well
i
said
i
certainly
was
a
good
deal
startled
but
no
harm
was
done
the
dog
took
it
more
to
heart
than
i
did
she
gave
a
short
laugh
yes
she
said
i
hardly
know
why
i
was
behaving
like
that
i
suppose
we
all
of
us
feel
skittish
at
times
she
paused
and
said
with
some
little
hesitation
you
have
them
i
suppose
and
at
the
same
time
she
rapidly
touched
her
ears
eyes
and
mouth
with
her
forefinger
i
looked
at
her
in
some
doubt
for
i
thought
might
not
she
be
one
of
the
unknown
who
wished
to
get
hold
of
the
five
jars
but
her
eye
was
honest
and
my
instinct
was
to
trust
her
so
i
nodded
and
put
my
finger
on
my
lips
of
course
she
said
well
you
are
the
first
since
i
was
a
little
thing
and
that
fourteen
hundred
years
ago
you
may
think
i
opened
my
eyes
yes
vitalis
was
the
last
and
he
lived
in
the
villa
they
called
it
so
down
by
the
stream
you
find
the
place
some
of
these
days
if
you
look
i
heard
talk
yesterday
that
someone
had
got
them
and
i
told
the
mist
was
about
last
night
perhaps
you
saw
it
yes
i
said
i
did
and
i
guessed
what
it
meant
and
i
told
her
all
that
had
happened
and
ended
by
asking
if
she
could
kindly
advise
me
what
to
do
she
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
handed
me
a
little
bunch
of
the
leaves
she
held
in
her
hand
clover
she
said
i
know
nothing
better
lay
it
on
the
box
itself
you
hear
of
them
again
be
sure
who
are
i
asked
in
a
whisper
she
shook
her
head
not
allowed
was
all
she
would
say
i
must
be
going
and
she
was
gone
sure
enough
you
might
suppose
as
i
did
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
that
my
new
sight
ought
to
have
been
able
to
see
what
became
of
her
i
think
it
would
if
she
had
gone
straight
away
from
me
but
what
i
believe
she
did
was
to
dart
round
behind
me
and
then
go
away
in
a
straight
line
so
that
i
was
left
looking
in
front
of
me
while
she
was
travelling
away
behind
me
like
a
bullet
from
a
gun
you
need
practice
with
these
things
and
i
had
only
been
at
it
a
couple
of
days
i
turned
and
walked
rather
quickly
homewards
for
i
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
protect
my
box
as
soon
as
possible
now
that
i
had
the
means
i
think
it
was
fortunate
that
i
did
as
i
opened
the
garden
gate
i
saw
an
old
woman
coming
down
the
path
an
old
woman
very
unlike
the
last
old
was
not
the
word
for
her
face
she
might
have
been
born
before
the
begin
as
to
her
expression
if
ever
you
saw
a
snake
with
red
rims
to
its
eyes
and
the
expression
of
a
parrot
you
might
have
some
idea
of
it
she
was
hobbling
along
with
a
stick
in
quite
the
proper
manner
but
i
felt
certain
that
all
that
was
put
on
and
that
she
could
have
glided
as
swift
as
an
adder
if
she
pleased
i
confess
i
was
afraid
of
her
i
had
a
feeling
that
she
knew
everything
and
hated
everybody
and
what
i
suddenly
thought
has
she
been
up
to
if
she
has
got
at
the
box
where
am
i
and
more
than
that
what
mischief
will
she
and
her
company
work
among
the
small
people
and
the
birds
and
beasts
there
would
be
no
mercy
for
them
a
glance
at
her
eye
told
me
that
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
see
that
she
could
not
possibly
have
got
the
box
about
her
and
another
relief
when
my
eye
travelled
to
the
door
of
the
house
and
i
saw
no
fewer
than
three
horseshoes
nailed
above
it
i
smiled
to
myself
oh
how
angry
she
looked
but
she
had
to
act
her
part
and
with
feeble
curtseys
and
in
a
very
small
hoarse
trembling
voice
she
wished
me
a
good
day
though
i
noticed
her
pointing
to
the
ground
with
her
thumb
as
she
said
the
words
and
would
be
very
obliged
if
i
could
tell
her
the
right
time
i
was
going
to
pull
out
my
watch
and
if
i
had
she
would
have
seen
a
certain
key
we
know
of
when
something
said
suddenly
and
clearly
to
my
brain
look
out
and
by
good
luck
i
heard
a
clock
inside
the
house
strike
one
before
i
could
answer
just
struck
one
was
my
reply
accordingly
and
i
said
it
as
innocently
as
i
could
she
drew
her
breath
in
hard
and
quivered
all
over
and
her
mouth
remained
open
like
a
cat
when
it
is
using
its
worst
expressions
and
when
she
eventually
thanked
me
i
leave
it
to
you
to
imagine
how
gracefully
she
did
it
well
she
had
no
more
cards
to
play
at
the
moment
and
no
excuse
for
remaining
i
stood
my
ground
and
watched
her
out
of
the
gate
a
path
led
down
the
meadow
and
much
against
her
will
no
doubt
she
had
to
keep
up
the
pretence
and
toil
painfully
along
it
until
she
reached
another
hedge
and
could
reckon
on
being
out
of
my
sight
after
that
i
neither
saw
nor
expected
to
see
anything
more
of
her
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
found
all
safe
and
laid
the
clover
on
the
box
at
luncheon
i
took
occasion
to
find
out
from
the
maid
without
asking
her
in
so
many
words
whether
the
old
woman
had
been
visible
to
her
evidently
she
had
not
evidently
also
the
evil
creatures
were
really
on
the
track
of
the
five
jars
knew
that
i
had
them
and
had
a
very
fair
idea
of
where
they
were
kept
however
if
the
maid
had
not
seen
her
the
cat
had
and
murmured
a
good
deal
to
herself
and
was
in
a
rather
nervous
state
she
sat
with
her
ears
turned
different
ways
on
the
looking
out
and
twitching
her
back
uncomfortably
like
an
old
lady
who
feels
a
draught
when
i
was
available
she
came
and
sat
on
my
knee
a
very
uncommon
attention
on
her
part
with
an
air
half
of
wishing
to
be
protected
and
half
of
undertaking
to
protect
me
if
there
is
fish
i
said
you
shall
have
some
but
i
was
not
yet
in
a
position
to
make
myself
understood
pussy
been
sleepin
on
your
box
all
the
afternoon
sir
said
the
maid
when
i
came
in
to
tea
i
could
get
her
to
come
off
and
when
i
did
turn
her
out
of
the
room
i
do
believe
she
climbed
up
and
got
in
again
by
the
winder
i
do
mind
at
all
i
said
let
her
be
there
if
she
likes
and
indeed
i
felt
quite
grateful
to
the
cat
i
do
know
that
she
could
have
done
much
if
there
had
been
any
attempt
on
the
box
but
i
was
sure
her
intentions
were
good
there
was
fish
that
evening
and
she
had
a
good
deal
of
it
she
did
not
say
much
that
i
could
follow
but
chiefly
sang
songs
without
words
not
to
go
over
the
preliminaries
again
i
did
when
the
proper
time
came
touch
my
tongue
with
the
contents
of
the
third
jar
i
found
that
it
worked
in
this
way
i
could
not
hear
what
i
was
saying
myself
when
i
was
talking
to
an
animal
i
only
the
remark
very
clearly
and
then
i
felt
my
tongue
and
lips
moving
in
an
odd
fashion
which
i
describe
but
with
the
small
people
in
human
shape
it
was
different
i
spoke
in
the
ordinary
way
to
them
and
though
i
dare
say
my
voice
went
up
an
octave
or
two
i
ca
say
i
perceived
it
the
village
was
there
again
and
the
life
going
on
in
it
seemed
much
the
same
i
was
set
upon
making
acquaintance
in
a
natural
sort
of
way
with
the
people
and
as
it
would
not
do
to
run
any
risk
of
startling
them
i
just
took
my
place
near
the
window
and
made
some
pretence
of
playing
patience
i
thought
it
likely
that
some
of
the
young
people
would
come
and
watch
me
in
spite
of
the
fright
they
had
had
the
night
before
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
heard
a
rustling
in
the
shrubs
under
the
window
and
voices
saying
is
he
in
there
can
you
see
oh
i
say
look
out
you
all
but
had
me
over
that
time
they
were
suddenly
quiet
after
this
and
apparently
one
must
have
very
cautiously
climbed
up
and
looked
into
the
room
when
he
got
down
again
there
was
a
great
fuss
no
is
he
really
what
say
he
was
doing
what
sort
of
charm
i
say
think
we
better
get
down
no
but
what
is
he
really
doing
laying
out
rows
of
flat
things
on
the
table
with
marks
on
them
i
do
believe
it
well
you
go
and
look
yourself
all
right
i
shall
yes
but
i
say
do
look
out
suppose
you
get
shut
in
and
we
late
for
the
bell
why
you
fool
i
sha
go
into
the
room
only
stop
on
the
well
i
do
know
but
i
do
believe
he
saw
us
last
night
and
my
father
said
he
thought
so
too
oh
well
he
ca
move
very
quick
anyway
and
he
some
way
off
the
window
shall
go
up
i
managed
without
altering
my
position
too
much
to
keep
my
eye
on
the
and
sure
enough
in
a
second
or
two
a
small
round
head
came
into
sight
i
went
on
with
my
game
at
first
i
could
see
that
the
watcher
was
ready
to
duck
down
at
the
slightest
provocation
but
as
i
took
no
sort
of
notice
he
gained
confidence
leant
his
elbows
on
the
sill
and
then
actually
pulled
himself
up
and
sat
down
on
it
he
bent
over
and
whispered
to
the
others
below
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
saw
a
whole
row
of
heads
filling
up
the
from
end
to
end
there
must
have
been
a
dozen
of
them
i
thought
the
time
was
come
and
without
moving
and
in
as
careless
a
tone
as
i
could
i
said
come
in
gentlemen
come
in
do
be
shy
there
was
a
rustle
and
two
or
three
heads
disappeared
but
nobody
said
anything
come
in
if
you
like
i
said
again
you
can
hear
the
bell
quite
well
from
here
and
i
sha
shut
the
window
promise
said
the
one
who
was
sitting
on
the
sill
i
promise
honour
bright
i
said
whereupon
he
made
the
plunge
first
he
dropped
on
to
the
seat
of
a
chair
by
the
window
and
from
that
to
the
floor
then
he
wandered
about
the
room
keeping
at
a
distance
from
me
at
first
and
i
have
no
doubt
watching
very
anxiously
to
see
whether
i
had
any
intention
of
pouncing
on
him
the
others
followed
first
one
by
one
and
then
two
or
three
at
a
time
some
remained
sitting
on
the
but
most
plucked
up
courage
to
get
down
on
to
the
floor
and
explore
i
had
now
my
first
good
chance
of
seeing
what
they
were
like
they
all
wore
the
same
fashion
of
clothes
a
tunic
and
hose
and
flat
caps
seemingly
very
much
what
a
boy
would
have
worn
in
queen
elizabeth
time
the
colours
were
sober
dark
blue
dark
red
grey
brown
and
each
one
clothes
were
of
one
colour
all
through
they
had
some
white
linen
underneath
it
showed
a
little
at
the
neck
there
were
both
fair
and
dark
among
them
all
were
clean
and
passably
one
or
two
certainly
handsome
the
firstcomer
was
ruddy
and
and
evidently
a
leader
they
called
him
wag
i
heard
whispers
from
corners
of
the
room
and
appeals
to
wag
to
explain
what
this
and
that
unfamiliar
object
was
and
noticed
that
he
was
never
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
of
some
kind
correct
or
not
the
fireplace
which
had
its
summer
dressing
was
it
appeared
a
rock
garden
an
old
letter
lying
on
the
floor
was
a
charm
better
not
touch
it
the
basket
not
unnaturally
a
prison
the
pattern
on
the
carpet
was
oh
you
would
understand
it
if
i
was
to
tell
you
soon
a
voice
wag
voice
came
from
somewhere
near
my
foot
i
say
could
i
get
up
on
the
top
i
offered
to
lift
him
but
he
declined
rather
hastily
and
said
my
leg
would
be
all
right
if
i
mind
putting
it
out
a
bit
sloping
and
he
then
ran
up
it
on
all
fours
he
was
quite
a
perceptible
weight
and
got
on
to
the
table
from
my
knee
without
any
difficulty
once
there
there
was
a
great
deal
to
interest
him
books
papers
ink
pens
pipes
matches
and
cards
he
was
full
of
questions
about
them
and
his
being
so
much
at
his
ease
encouraged
the
others
to
follow
him
so
that
before
very
long
the
whole
lot
were
perambulating
the
table
and
making
me
very
nervous
lest
they
should
fall
off
while
wag
was
standing
close
up
to
me
and
putting
me
through
a
catechism
what
do
you
have
such
spears
for
he
wanted
to
know
brandishing
a
pen
at
me
is
that
blood
on
the
end
whose
blood
well
then
what
do
you
do
with
it
let
see
only
that
when
i
wrote
a
word
or
two
well
you
can
tell
me
about
it
another
time
now
i
want
to
know
what
these
clubs
in
the
chest
are
i
said
we
make
fire
with
them
if
you
like
i
show
you
but
it
makes
a
little
noise
go
on
said
wag
and
i
struck
a
match
rather
expecting
a
stampede
but
no
they
were
quite
unmoved
and
wag
said
beastly
row
and
smell
why
do
you
do
the
ordinary
way
he
brushed
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
along
the
tips
of
the
fingers
on
his
right
hand
put
them
to
his
lips
and
then
to
his
eyes
and
behold
his
eyes
began
to
glow
from
behind
with
a
light
which
would
have
been
quite
bright
enough
for
him
to
read
by
quite
simple
he
said
you
know
it
then
he
did
the
same
thing
in
reverse
order
touching
eyes
lips
and
hand
and
the
light
was
gone
i
did
like
to
confess
that
this
was
beyond
me
yes
that
all
very
well
i
said
but
how
do
you
manage
about
your
houses
i
am
sure
i
saw
lights
in
the
windows
course
he
said
put
as
many
as
you
want
and
he
ran
round
the
table
dabbing
his
hand
here
and
there
on
the
cloth
or
on
anything
that
lay
on
it
and
at
every
place
a
little
round
bud
or
drop
of
very
bright
but
also
soft
light
came
out
see
he
said
and
darted
round
again
passing
his
hands
over
the
lights
and
touching
his
lips
and
they
were
gone
he
came
back
and
said
it
a
better
way
it
is
as
if
it
were
only
my
native
stupidity
that
prevented
me
from
using
it
myself
a
smaller
one
who
looked
to
me
rather
a
quieter
sort
than
wag
had
come
up
and
was
standing
by
him
he
now
said
in
a
low
voice
they
ca
it
seemed
a
new
idea
to
wag
he
made
his
eyes
very
round
ca
oh
rot
it
quite
simple
the
other
shook
his
head
and
pointed
to
my
hand
which
rested
on
the
table
wag
looked
at
it
too
and
then
at
my
face
could
i
see
it
spread
out
he
said
yes
if
you
promise
not
to
spoil
it
he
laughed
slightly
and
then
both
he
and
the
other
whom
he
called
slim
bent
over
and
looked
closely
at
the
tips
of
my
fingers
other
side
please
he
said
after
a
time
and
they
subjected
my
nails
to
a
like
examination
the
others
who
had
been
at
the
remoter
parts
of
the
table
wandered
up
and
looked
over
their
shoulders
after
tapping
my
nails
and
lifting
up
one
or
more
fingers
wag
stood
upright
and
said
well
i
it
true
and
you
ca
i
thought
your
sort
could
do
anything
i
thought
much
the
same
about
you
i
said
in
i
always
thought
you
could
fly
but
you
so
we
can
said
wag
very
sharply
and
his
face
grew
red
oh
i
said
then
why
have
you
been
doing
it
he
kicked
one
foot
with
the
other
and
looked
quickly
at
slim
the
rest
said
nothing
and
edged
away
humming
to
themselves
well
we
fly
perfectly
well
only
only
not
i
suppose
said
i
rather
unkindly
no
said
wag
and
you
need
laugh
either
soon
show
you
that
be
nice
i
said
and
when
will
you
show
me
let
see
he
turned
to
slim
two
nights
more
is
it
all
right
then
to
me
in
two
nights
more
you
see
just
then
a
moth
which
flew
in
caused
a
welcome
diversion
for
i
could
see
that
somehow
i
had
touched
on
a
sore
subject
and
that
he
was
feeling
awkward
and
he
first
jumped
at
it
and
then
ran
after
it
slim
lingered
i
raised
my
eyebrows
and
pointed
at
wag
slim
nodded
the
fact
is
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
got
us
into
rather
a
row
yesterday
and
we
all
stopped
flying
for
three
nights
oh
said
i
i
you
must
tell
him
i
am
very
sorry
for
being
so
stupid
may
i
ask
who
stopped
you
oh
just
the
old
man
not
the
owls
you
do
go
to
the
owls
for
something
then
i
asked
trying
to
appear
intelligent
yes
history
and
geography
to
be
sure
i
said
of
course
they
seen
a
lot
have
they
so
they
say
said
slim
but
just
then
the
low
toll
of
the
bell
was
wafted
through
the
window
and
there
was
an
instant
scurry
to
the
edge
of
the
table
then
to
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
up
to
the
small
arms
waved
caps
at
me
the
shrubs
rustled
and
i
was
left
alone
v
danger
to
the
jars
now
my
ears
and
eyes
and
tongue
had
been
dealt
with
and
what
remained
were
the
forehead
and
the
chest
i
could
not
guess
what
would
come
of
treating
these
with
the
ointment
but
i
thought
i
would
try
the
forehead
first
there
was
still
a
day
or
two
when
the
moon
would
be
bright
enough
for
the
trial
i
hoped
that
perhaps
the
effect
of
these
two
last
jars
might
be
to
make
me
able
to
go
on
with
my
experiences
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
new
people
i
had
come
across
during
the
time
when
she
the
moon
i
mean
was
out
of
sight
i
had
one
anxiety
the
precious
box
must
be
guarded
from
those
who
were
after
it
about
this
i
had
a
conviction
that
if
i
could
keep
them
off
until
i
had
used
each
of
the
five
jars
the
box
and
i
would
be
safe
why
i
felt
sure
of
this
i
could
not
say
but
my
experience
had
led
me
to
trust
these
beliefs
that
came
into
my
head
and
i
meant
to
trust
this
one
it
would
be
best
i
thought
if
i
did
not
go
far
from
the
house
perhaps
even
if
i
did
not
leave
it
at
all
till
the
time
of
danger
was
past
several
things
happened
in
the
course
of
the
morning
which
confirmed
me
in
my
belief
i
took
up
a
position
at
the
table
by
the
window
of
my
i
had
put
the
box
in
my
which
i
had
locked
and
i
now
laid
it
beside
me
where
i
could
keep
an
eye
upon
it
the
view
from
my
window
showed
me
first
the
garden
of
the
cottage
with
its
lawn
and
little
flower
beds
its
hedge
and
back
gate
and
beyond
that
a
path
leading
down
across
a
field
more
fields
i
knew
came
after
that
one
and
sloped
pretty
sharply
down
to
a
stream
in
the
valley
which
i
could
not
see
but
i
could
see
the
steep
slope
of
fields
partly
pasture
and
then
clothed
with
green
woods
towards
the
top
there
were
no
other
houses
in
sight
the
road
was
behind
me
passing
the
front
of
the
cottage
and
my
bedroom
looked
out
that
way
i
had
some
writing
and
reading
to
do
and
i
had
not
long
finished
breakfast
before
i
settled
down
to
it
and
heard
the
maid
doing
out
the
bedroom
as
usual
accompanied
every
now
and
then
by
a
slight
mew
from
the
cat
who
also
as
usual
was
watching
her
at
work
these
mews
meant
nothing
in
particular
i
may
say
they
were
only
intended
to
be
met
by
an
encouraging
remark
such
as
there
you
are
then
pussy
or
do
get
in
my
way
now
or
all
in
good
time
finally
i
heard
come
along
then
and
let
see
what
we
got
for
you
downstairs
and
the
door
was
shut
i
mention
this
because
of
what
happened
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
there
was
suddenly
a
fearful
crash
in
the
bedroom
a
fall
a
breaking
of
glass
and
crockery
and
snapping
of
wood
and
then
fainter
sobbings
and
moans
of
pain
i
started
up
goodness
i
thought
she
must
have
been
dusting
that
heavy
shelf
high
up
on
the
wall
with
all
the
china
on
it
and
the
whole
thing
has
given
way
she
must
be
badly
hurt
but
why
does
her
mistress
come
rushing
upstairs
and
what
was
that
rasping
noise
just
beside
me
i
looked
at
my
which
lay
on
the
table
just
inside
the
open
window
across
the
new
smooth
top
of
it
there
were
three
deep
scratches
running
towards
the
window
which
had
not
been
there
before
i
moved
it
to
the
other
side
of
me
and
sat
down
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
decoy
me
out
of
the
room
and
it
had
failed
certainly
there
would
be
more
i
waited
but
everything
was
quiet
in
the
house
no
more
noise
from
the
bedroom
and
no
one
moving
about
upstairs
or
downstairs
nothing
but
the
pump
clanking
in
the
scullery
i
turned
to
my
work
again
half
an
hour
must
have
gone
by
and
though
on
the
i
was
not
fidgety
then
i
was
aware
of
a
confused
noise
from
the
field
outside
help
help
keep
off
you
brute
help
you
there
as
well
as
i
could
make
out
again
and
again
towards
the
far
end
of
the
field
which
was
a
pretty
large
one
a
poor
old
man
was
trying
to
get
to
a
gate
in
the
hedge
at
a
staggering
run
and
striking
now
and
then
with
his
stick
at
a
great
which
was
leaping
up
at
him
with
hollow
barks
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
but
the
promptest
dash
to
the
spot
could
save
him
it
seemed
too
as
if
he
had
caught
sight
of
me
at
the
window
for
he
beckoned
how
strange
the
cries
sounded
it
was
as
if
someone
was
shouting
into
an
empty
jug
my
were
by
me
on
the
table
and
i
thought
i
would
take
just
look
before
i
rushed
out
i
am
glad
i
did
for
do
you
know
when
i
had
the
glasses
focused
on
the
dog
and
the
man
all
that
i
could
see
was
a
sort
of
fuzz
of
dancing
vapour
much
as
if
the
shimmering
air
that
you
see
on
the
heath
on
a
hot
day
had
been
gathered
up
and
rolled
into
a
shape
ha
ha
i
said
as
i
put
down
the
glasses
and
something
in
the
air
about
four
yards
off
made
a
sharp
hissing
sound
no
doubt
there
were
words
but
i
could
not
distinguish
them
a
second
attempt
had
failed
you
may
be
sure
i
was
well
on
the
alert
for
the
next
i
put
away
my
books
now
and
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
and
wondering
as
i
watched
whether
there
was
anything
out
of
the
common
to
be
noticed
for
one
thing
i
thought
there
were
more
little
birds
about
than
i
expected
at
first
i
did
not
see
them
for
they
were
not
hopping
about
on
the
lawn
but
as
i
stared
at
the
hedge
of
the
garden
and
at
that
of
the
field
i
became
aware
that
these
were
full
of
life
on
almost
every
twig
that
could
hold
a
bird
in
shelter
not
on
the
top
of
the
hedges
a
bird
was
sitting
quite
still
and
they
were
all
looking
towards
the
window
as
if
they
were
expecting
something
to
happen
there
occasionally
one
would
flutter
its
wings
a
little
and
turn
its
head
towards
its
neighbour
but
this
was
all
they
did
i
picked
up
my
glasses
and
began
to
study
the
bottom
of
the
hedges
and
the
bushes
where
there
was
some
quantity
of
dead
leaves
and
here
too
i
could
see
that
there
were
spectators
a
small
bright
eye
or
a
bit
of
a
nose
was
visible
almost
wherever
i
looked
in
short
the
mice
and
i
do
doubt
some
of
the
rats
hedgehogs
and
toads
as
well
were
collected
there
and
were
as
intently
on
the
watch
as
the
birds
what
a
chance
for
the
cat
if
only
she
knew
i
put
my
head
cautiously
out
of
the
window
and
looking
down
on
the
sill
of
the
window
below
i
could
see
her
head
with
the
ears
pushed
forward
she
was
looking
earnestly
at
the
hedge
but
she
did
not
move
only
at
the
slight
noise
i
made
she
turned
her
face
upwards
and
crowed
to
me
in
a
modest
but
encouraging
manner
time
passed
on
luncheon
was
laid
on
another
table
and
was
over
before
anything
else
happened
the
next
thing
was
that
i
heard
the
maid
saying
sharply
what
business
you
got
going
round
to
the
back
we
do
want
none
of
your
rubbish
here
a
hoarse
voice
answered
inaudibly
no
nor
the
gentleman
do
want
none
of
your
stuff
neither
and
how
do
you
know
there
a
gentleman
here
at
all
i
should
like
to
know
what
do
mean
no
offence
i
dare
say
that
more
than
i
know
well
that
the
last
word
i
got
to
say
in
a
minute
more
there
was
a
knock
at
my
door
and
at
the
same
time
a
step
on
the
gravel
path
under
my
window
and
a
loud
hiss
from
the
cat
as
i
said
come
in
to
the
knock
i
hastily
looked
out
of
the
window
but
saw
nothing
it
was
the
maid
who
had
knocked
she
had
come
to
ask
if
there
was
anything
i
should
like
from
the
village
or
anything
i
should
want
before
because
the
mistress
was
going
out
and
wanted
her
to
go
over
and
fetch
something
from
the
shop
i
said
there
was
nothing
except
the
letters
and
perhaps
a
small
parcel
from
the
post
office
she
lingered
a
moment
before
going
and
finally
said
you
excuse
me
naming
it
sir
but
there
seems
to
be
some
funny
people
about
the
roads
if
you
please
to
be
what
i
mean
to
say
a
bit
on
the
if
you
not
out
yourself
certainly
i
said
no
i
do
mean
to
go
out
by
the
way
who
was
it
came
to
the
door
just
now
oh
it
was
one
of
these
men
not
one
i
seen
before
and
he
must
be
a
stranger
in
this
part
i
think
because
he
began
going
round
to
the
garden
door
only
i
stopped
him
he
got
these
cheap
rubbishing
and
what
not
leastways
if
you
understand
me
what
i
thought
to
myself
i
should
like
to
be
seen
with
whatever
others
might
yes
i
see
i
answered
and
she
went
and
i
turned
to
my
books
once
more
within
a
very
few
minutes
i
began
to
suspect
that
i
was
getting
sleepy
yes
it
was
undoubtedly
so
what
with
the
warmth
of
the
day
and
lunch
and
not
having
been
out
there
was
a
curious
smell
in
the
room
too
not
exactly
nasty
like
something
burning
what
did
it
remind
me
of
wood
smoke
from
a
cottage
fire
that
one
smells
on
an
autumn
evening
as
one
comes
bicycling
down
the
hill
into
a
village
not
quite
so
nice
as
that
something
more
like
a
chemist
shop
i
wondered
and
as
i
wondered
my
eyes
closed
and
my
head
went
forward
a
sharp
pain
on
the
back
of
my
hand
and
a
crash
of
glass
up
i
jumped
and
which
of
three
or
four
things
i
realized
first
i
do
know
now
but
i
did
realize
in
a
second
or
two
that
my
hand
was
bleeding
from
a
scratch
all
down
the
back
of
it
that
a
pane
of
the
window
was
broken
and
that
the
whole
window
was
darkened
with
little
birds
that
were
bumping
their
chests
against
it
that
the
cat
was
on
the
table
gazing
into
my
face
with
intense
expression
that
a
little
smoke
was
drifting
into
the
room
and
that
my
was
on
the
point
of
slipping
out
over
the
a
despairing
dash
at
it
i
made
and
managed
to
clutch
it
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
pull
it
back
i
could
see
no
string
or
cord
much
less
any
hand
that
was
dragging
at
it
i
hardly
dared
to
take
my
hand
from
it
to
catch
up
something
and
hack
at
the
thief
i
could
not
see
besides
there
was
nothing
within
reach
then
i
remembered
the
knife
in
my
pocket
could
i
get
it
out
and
open
it
without
losing
hold
they
hate
steel
i
thought
somehow
frantically
holding
on
with
one
hand
i
got
out
the
knife
and
opened
it
goodness
knows
how
for
it
was
horribly
small
and
stiff
with
my
teeth
and
sheared
and
stabbed
indiscriminately
all
round
the
farther
end
of
the
thank
goodness
the
strain
relaxed
i
got
the
thing
inside
the
window
dropped
it
and
stood
on
it
craning
over
the
garden
path
and
round
the
corner
of
the
house
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
the
birds
were
gone
the
cat
was
still
on
the
table
saying
o
you
owl
o
you
owl
the
sole
and
only
clue
to
what
had
been
happening
was
a
small
earthenware
saucer
that
lay
on
the
path
immediately
below
the
window
with
a
little
heap
of
ashes
in
it
from
which
a
thin
column
of
smoke
was
coming
straight
up
and
curling
over
when
it
reached
the
window
level
that
i
could
not
doubt
was
the
cause
of
my
sudden
sleepiness
i
dropped
a
large
book
straight
on
to
it
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
it
crush
to
bits
and
of
seeing
the
smoke
go
four
ways
along
the
ground
and
vanish
i
was
perfectly
awake
now
i
looked
at
the
cat
and
showed
her
the
back
of
my
hand
she
sat
quite
still
and
said
well
what
did
you
expect
i
had
to
do
something
i
lick
it
if
you
like
but
i
rather
not
no
particular
you
understand
all
the
same
a
hundred
years
hence
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
answer
her
so
i
shook
my
head
at
her
wound
up
my
hand
in
a
handkerchief
and
then
stroked
her
she
took
it
agreeably
jumped
off
the
table
and
requested
to
be
let
out
so
the
third
attack
had
failed
i
sat
down
and
looked
out
the
hedges
were
empty
not
a
bird
not
a
mouse
was
left
i
took
this
to
mean
that
the
dangerous
time
was
past
and
great
was
the
relief
soon
i
heard
the
maid
come
back
from
her
errands
in
the
village
then
the
chaise
then
the
clock
striking
five
i
felt
it
would
be
all
right
for
me
to
go
out
after
tea
and
so
i
did
first
however
concealing
the
in
my
bedroom
not
that
i
supposed
hiding
it
would
be
of
much
use
and
piling
upon
it
poker
tongs
knife
horseshoe
and
anything
else
i
could
find
which
i
thought
would
keep
off
trespassers
i
had
by
the
way
to
explain
to
the
maid
that
a
bird
had
flown
against
the
window
and
broken
it
and
when
she
said
stupid
tiresome
little
things
they
are
i
am
afraid
i
did
not
contradict
her
i
went
out
by
way
of
the
garden
and
crossed
the
field
near
the
middle
of
which
stands
a
large
old
oak
i
went
up
to
this
for
no
particular
reason
and
stood
gazing
at
the
trunk
as
i
did
so
i
became
aware
that
my
eyes
were
beginning
to
see
through
and
behold
a
family
of
owls
was
inside
as
it
was
near
evening
they
were
getting
wakeful
stirring
smacking
their
beaks
and
opening
their
wings
a
little
from
time
to
time
at
last
one
of
them
said
time
nearly
up
out
and
about
out
and
about
anyone
outside
said
another
no
harm
there
said
the
first
this
short
way
of
talking
i
believe
was
due
to
the
owls
not
being
properly
awake
and
consequently
sulky
as
they
brightened
up
and
got
their
eyes
open
they
began
to
be
more
easy
in
manner
oop
oop
oop
i
had
a
very
good
day
of
it
you
have
too
i
hope
sound
as
a
rock
i
thank
you
except
when
they
were
carrying
on
at
the
cottage
oh
goodness
i
forgot
they
did
bring
it
off
i
hope
not
they
the
watch
was
too
well
set
but
it
was
wanted
i
had
a
leaf
about
it
a
few
minutes
after
and
it
seems
they
got
him
asleep
well
i
never
heard
anyone
bring
a
leaf
i
dare
say
not
but
i
was
expecting
it
pigeon
dropped
it
there
it
is
on
that
child
back
i
saw
the
stoop
and
examine
a
dead
chestnut
leaf
which
lay
as
the
other
had
said
on
an
owlet
back
said
this
owlet
suddenly
in
a
shrill
voice
may
i
go
out
but
all
that
father
did
was
to
clasp
its
head
in
his
claw
and
push
it
to
and
fro
several
times
when
he
let
go
the
owlet
made
no
sound
but
crept
away
and
hid
its
face
in
a
corner
and
heaved
as
if
with
sobs
father
closed
his
eyes
slowly
and
opened
them
slowly
amused
i
thought
the
mother
had
been
reading
the
leaf
all
the
time
dear
me
interesting
she
said
i
suppose
now
the
worst
of
it
is
over
all
quiet
for
anyhow
said
father
but
i
wish
he
could
see
someone
about
that
their
last
chance
and
they
he
ruffled
up
his
feathers
lifted
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
the
awkwardness
is
he
went
on
if
i
say
too
much
and
they
do
get
the
jars
there
one
risk
and
if
there
no
warning
and
they
get
them
there
another
risk
but
if
there
a
warning
and
they
get
them
said
she
very
sensibly
well
to
be
sure
that
would
be
better
even
though
we
do
know
much
about
him
but
where
do
you
suppose
he
is
and
whom
ought
he
to
see
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
to
know
and
i
thanked
her
why
as
to
the
first
i
suspect
he
outside
there
is
someone
there
and
why
they
should
stop
there
all
this
time
unless
they
listening
i
do
know
good
gracious
listening
to
our
private
conversation
and
me
with
my
feathers
all
anyhow
she
began
to
peck
at
herself
vigorously
but
this
was
straying
from
the
point
and
annoyed
me
however
father
went
slowly
on
as
to
that
i
do
much
care
whether
he
listening
or
not
as
to
whom
he
ought
to
see
that
rather
more
difficult
if
he
got
as
far
as
talking
to
any
of
the
right
people
he
said
this
as
if
they
had
capital
letters
they
know
of
course
and
some
of
them
down
about
the
village
they
know
and
the
old
mother
knows
and
what
about
the
boys
said
she
pausing
in
the
middle
of
her
toilet
and
poking
her
head
up
at
him
he
wholly
disdained
to
answer
and
merely
butted
at
her
with
his
head
so
that
she
slipped
down
off
her
ledge
several
inches
with
a
great
scrabbling
oh
she
said
peevishly
as
she
climbed
back
i
all
untidy
again
well
then
do
ask
such
ridiculous
questions
i
shall
buffle
you
with
both
wings
next
time
and
now
as
soon
as
the
coast
is
clear
i
shall
be
out
and
about
i
took
the
hint
and
moved
off
for
i
had
learnt
as
much
perhaps
as
i
could
expect
even
if
all
was
not
yet
plain
and
before
i
had
gone
many
paces
i
was
aware
of
the
pair
both
sailing
smoothly
off
in
the
opposite
direction
i
was
seeing
through
a
good
deal
that
evening
it
is
surprising
what
a
lot
of
coppers
people
drop
even
on
a
field
path
surprising
too
in
how
many
places
there
lie
unsuspected
bones
of
men
some
things
i
saw
which
were
ugly
and
sad
like
that
but
more
that
were
amusing
and
even
exciting
there
is
one
spot
i
could
show
where
four
gold
cups
stand
round
what
was
once
a
book
but
the
book
is
no
more
than
earth
now
that
however
i
did
not
see
on
this
particular
evening
what
i
remember
best
is
a
family
of
young
rabbits
huddled
round
their
parents
in
a
burrow
and
the
mother
telling
a
story
and
so
then
he
went
a
little
farther
and
found
a
dandelion
and
stopped
and
sat
up
and
began
to
eat
it
and
when
he
had
eaten
two
large
leaves
and
one
little
one
he
saw
a
fly
on
it
no
two
flies
and
then
he
thought
he
had
had
enough
of
that
dandelion
and
he
went
a
little
farther
and
found
another
dandelion
and
so
it
went
on
interminably
and
entirely
stupid
like
everything
else
i
ever
heard
a
rabbit
say
for
they
have
forgotten
all
about
their
ancestor
brer
rabbit
however
the
children
were
absorbed
in
the
story
so
much
so
that
they
never
heard
a
stoat
making
its
way
down
the
burrow
but
i
heard
it
and
by
stamping
and
driving
my
stick
in
i
was
able
to
make
it
turn
tail
and
go
off
cursing
all
stoats
weasels
ferrets
polecats
are
of
the
wrong
people
as
you
may
imagine
and
so
are
most
rats
and
bats
at
last
i
left
off
seeing
through
by
trying
not
to
do
so
and
went
back
to
the
house
where
i
found
all
safe
and
quiet
i
ought
to
say
that
i
had
not
as
yet
tried
speaking
to
any
animal
even
to
the
cat
when
she
scratched
me
but
i
thought
i
would
try
it
now
so
when
she
came
in
at
and
circled
about
with
what
i
may
call
pious
aspirations
about
fish
and
other
such
things
i
summoned
up
my
courage
and
said
using
my
voice
in
the
way
i
described
or
rather
did
not
describe
before
i
used
to
be
told
you
are
hungry
you
can
eat
dry
bread
she
was
certainly
horribly
startled
at
first
i
thought
she
would
have
dashed
up
the
chimney
or
out
of
the
window
but
she
recovered
pretty
quickly
and
sat
down
still
looking
at
me
with
intense
surprise
i
suppose
i
might
have
guessed
she
said
but
dear
what
a
turn
you
did
give
me
i
feel
quite
faint
and
gracious
what
a
day
it
has
been
when
i
found
you
dozing
off
like
a
great
well
no
one
wants
to
be
rude
do
they
but
i
can
tell
you
i
had
more
than
half
a
mind
to
go
at
your
face
i
am
glad
you
did
i
said
and
really
you
know
it
was
my
fault
it
was
that
stuff
they
were
burning
on
the
path
i
know
that
well
enough
she
said
but
to
come
back
to
the
point
all
this
anxiety
has
made
me
as
empty
in
myself
as
a
clean
saucer
just
what
i
was
saying
if
you
are
hungry
you
can
say
that
again
say
it
just
once
more
she
said
and
her
eyes
grew
narrow
as
she
said
it
and
i
shall
what
shall
you
do
i
asked
for
she
stopped
suddenly
she
calmed
herself
oh
you
know
how
it
is
when
one
been
all
and
worked
up
we
all
say
more
than
we
mean
but
that
about
dry
bread
well
there
i
simply
ca
bear
it
it
a
wicked
cruel
untruth
that
what
it
is
and
besides
you
be
going
to
eat
all
the
whole
of
what
she
put
down
for
you
excitement
was
coming
on
again
and
she
ended
with
a
loud
mew
well
i
gave
her
what
she
seemed
to
want
and
shortly
after
worn
out
doubtless
with
the
fatigues
of
the
day
she
went
to
sleep
on
a
chair
not
even
caring
to
follow
the
maid
downstairs
when
things
were
cleared
away
vi
the
cat
wag
slim
and
others
i
got
out
my
precious
casket
i
sat
by
the
window
and
watched
the
moon
shone
out
the
lid
of
the
box
loosened
in
due
course
and
i
touched
my
forehead
with
the
ointment
but
neither
at
once
nor
for
some
little
time
after
did
i
notice
any
fresh
power
coming
to
me
with
the
moon
up
came
also
the
little
town
and
no
sooner
were
the
doors
of
the
houses
level
with
the
grass
than
the
boys
were
out
of
them
and
running
in
some
numbers
towards
my
window
in
fact
some
slipped
out
of
their
own
windows
not
waiting
for
the
doors
to
be
available
wag
was
the
first
slim
more
sedate
came
among
the
crowd
that
followed
these
were
still
the
only
two
who
felt
no
hesitation
about
talking
to
me
the
others
were
all
fully
occupied
in
exploring
the
room
i
said
after
some
sort
of
had
been
exchanged
you
be
flying
all
over
the
place
i
suppose
yes
said
wag
shortly
but
i
want
to
know
i
say
slim
what
was
it
we
wanted
first
was
there
a
message
from
your
father
said
slim
oh
yes
of
course
they
about
the
house
he
said
them
horseshoes
if
there
a
squirt
at
it
he
thinks
there
a
squirt
in
the
oh
there
the
cat
i
must
after
delivering
all
this
in
one
sentence
he
rushed
to
the
edge
of
the
table
and
took
a
kind
of
header
into
the
midst
of
the
unfortunate
animal
who
however
only
moaned
or
crowed
without
waking
and
turned
partly
over
on
her
back
slim
remained
sitting
on
a
book
and
gazing
soberly
at
me
well
i
said
it
very
kind
of
wag
father
to
send
me
a
message
but
i
must
say
i
ca
make
much
of
it
slim
nodded
so
he
said
and
he
said
you
see
when
the
time
came
of
course
i
do
know
myself
i
never
seen
a
wag
says
he
has
but
you
never
know
with
wag
well
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
i
suppose
but
look
here
slim
i
wish
you
could
tell
me
one
or
two
things
what
you
what
do
they
call
you
they
call
me
slim
and
the
whole
of
us
they
call
the
right
people
said
slim
but
it
no
good
asking
us
much
because
we
do
know
and
besides
it
is
good
for
us
how
do
you
mean
why
you
see
our
job
is
to
keep
the
little
things
right
and
if
we
do
more
than
that
or
if
we
try
to
find
out
much
more
then
we
burst
and
is
that
the
end
of
you
oh
no
he
said
cheerfully
but
that
one
of
the
things
it
no
good
asking
and
if
you
do
do
your
job
what
then
oh
then
they
get
smaller
and
have
no
sense
he
said
not
i
noticed
i
see
well
now
you
go
to
school
do
you
he
nodded
what
for
is
that
likely
to
be
bad
for
you
i
hardly
liked
to
say
make
you
burst
no
he
said
you
see
it
to
learn
our
job
we
have
to
be
told
what
used
to
go
on
so
as
we
can
put
things
right
or
keep
them
right
and
the
owls
you
see
they
remember
a
long
way
back
but
they
do
know
any
more
than
we
do
about
the
swell
things
i
was
very
shy
about
putting
the
next
question
i
had
in
mind
but
i
felt
i
must
now
do
you
know
how
old
you
are
or
how
long
it
takes
you
to
grow
up
or
how
how
long
you
go
on
when
you
grown
up
he
pressed
his
hands
to
his
head
and
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
for
the
moment
that
it
might
be
swelling
and
would
burst
but
it
was
not
so
bad
as
that
after
a
few
seconds
he
looked
up
and
said
i
think
it
seven
times
seven
moons
since
i
went
to
school
and
seven
times
seven
times
seven
moons
before
i
grow
up
and
the
rest
is
no
good
asking
but
it
all
right
upon
which
he
smiled
and
this
i
may
say
was
the
most
part
of
what
i
ventured
to
ask
any
of
them
about
themselves
but
at
other
times
i
gathered
that
as
long
as
they
did
their
job
nothing
could
injure
them
and
they
were
regularly
measured
all
of
them
to
see
if
they
were
getting
smaller
and
a
careful
record
kept
but
if
anyone
lost
as
much
as
a
quarter
of
his
height
he
was
doomed
and
he
crept
off
out
of
the
settlement
whether
such
a
one
ever
came
back
i
could
not
be
sure
most
of
the
failures
and
they
were
not
common
went
and
lived
in
hollow
trees
or
by
brooks
and
were
happy
enough
but
in
a
feeble
way
not
remembering
much
nor
able
to
make
anything
and
it
was
supposed
that
very
slowly
they
shrunk
to
the
size
of
a
pin
point
and
probably
to
nothing
all
the
same
it
was
believed
that
they
recover
many
other
things
that
would
have
asked
i
did
not
being
anxious
to
avoid
giving
trouble
but
this
time
anyhow
i
felt
i
had
catechized
slim
long
enough
so
i
broke
off
and
said
what
can
wag
be
doing
all
this
while
there
no
knowing
said
slim
but
he
very
quiet
for
him
either
he
doing
something
awful
or
he
asleep
i
saw
him
with
the
cat
last
i
said
you
might
go
and
look
at
her
he
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
table
and
said
why
he
asleep
and
so
he
was
with
his
head
on
the
cat
chest
under
her
chin
which
she
had
turned
up
and
she
had
put
her
front
paws
together
over
the
top
of
his
head
as
for
the
others
i
descried
them
sitting
in
a
circle
in
a
corner
of
the
room
also
very
quiet
i
imagine
they
were
a
little
afraid
of
doing
much
without
wag
and
also
of
waking
him
but
i
could
not
make
out
what
they
were
doing
so
i
asked
slim
racing
earwigs
i
should
think
he
said
with
something
of
contempt
well
i
hope
they
wo
leave
them
about
when
they
go
i
do
like
earwigs
who
does
he
said
but
they
take
them
away
all
right
prize
ones
some
of
them
i
went
over
and
looked
at
the
racing
for
a
little
the
course
was
neatly
marked
out
with
small
lights
sprouting
out
of
the
boards
and
the
circle
was
at
the
the
starters
being
at
the
other
end
some
six
feet
away
i
watched
one
heat
the
earwigs
seemed
to
me
neither
very
speedy
nor
very
intelligent
and
all
except
one
were
apt
to
stop
in
and
engage
in
personal
encounters
with
each
other
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
how
long
this
would
go
on
when
wag
woke
up
like
most
of
us
he
was
not
willing
to
allow
that
he
had
been
asleep
i
thought
i
just
lie
down
a
bit
he
said
and
then
i
did
want
to
bustle
your
cat
so
i
stopped
there
and
now
i
want
to
know
slim
i
say
what
was
it
you
were
asking
me
me
asking
you
i
do
know
oh
yes
you
do
what
he
was
doing
the
other
time
before
we
came
in
i
did
ask
you
that
you
asked
me
well
it
does
matter
who
asked
turning
to
me
what
you
doing
i
do
know
i
said
was
it
these
things
i
was
using
taking
up
a
pack
of
cards
or
something
like
this
i
held
up
a
book
yes
that
one
what
were
you
doing
with
it
what
it
for
we
call
it
reading
a
book
and
i
tried
to
explain
what
the
idea
was
and
read
out
a
few
lines
it
happened
to
be
they
were
absorbed
slim
said
half
to
himself
something
like
a
glass
which
i
thought
quite
meaningless
at
the
time
then
i
showed
them
a
picture
in
another
book
that
they
made
out
very
quickly
but
when
it
going
to
move
on
said
slim
never
i
said
ours
stop
just
like
that
always
do
yours
move
on
of
course
they
do
look
here
he
lay
down
on
the
tablecloth
and
pressed
his
forehead
on
it
but
evidently
could
make
nothing
of
it
it
all
rough
he
said
i
gave
him
a
sheet
of
paper
that
better
and
he
lay
down
again
in
the
same
posture
for
a
few
seconds
then
he
got
up
and
began
rubbing
the
paper
all
over
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
as
he
did
so
a
coloured
picture
came
out
pretty
quickly
and
when
it
was
finished
he
drew
aside
to
let
me
see
and
said
somewhat
bashfully
i
do
think
i
got
it
right
but
i
meant
it
for
what
happened
the
other
evening
he
had
certainly
not
got
it
right
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
it
was
a
view
of
the
window
of
the
house
seen
from
outside
by
moonlight
and
there
was
a
back
view
of
a
row
of
figures
with
their
elbows
on
the
sill
so
far
so
good
but
inside
the
open
window
was
standing
a
figure
which
was
plainly
much
too
plainly
i
thought
meant
for
me
far
too
short
and
fat
far
too
and
with
an
owlish
expression
which
i
am
sure
i
never
wear
this
person
was
now
seen
to
move
his
hand
a
very
poor
hand
with
only
about
three
fingers
to
his
side
and
pull
apparently
out
of
his
body
a
round
object
more
or
less
like
a
watch
at
any
rate
it
was
white
on
one
side
with
black
marks
and
yellow
on
the
other
and
lay
it
down
in
front
of
him
at
this
the
figures
at
the
threw
up
their
arms
in
all
directions
and
fell
or
slid
down
like
so
many
dolls
then
the
picture
began
to
get
fainter
and
disappeared
from
the
paper
slim
looked
at
me
expectantly
well
i
said
it
very
interesting
to
see
how
you
do
it
but
is
that
the
best
likeness
of
me
that
you
can
make
what
wrong
with
it
said
he
is
it
handsome
enough
or
something
i
heard
wag
throw
himself
down
on
the
table
and
looking
at
him
i
saw
that
he
had
got
both
hands
pressed
over
his
mouth
may
i
ask
what
the
joke
is
i
said
rather
dryly
for
it
is
surprising
how
touchy
one
can
be
over
one
personal
appearance
even
at
my
time
of
life
he
looked
up
for
an
instant
at
me
and
then
gasped
and
hid
his
face
again
slim
went
up
to
him
and
kicked
him
in
the
ribs
where
your
manners
he
said
in
a
loud
whisper
wag
rolled
over
and
sat
up
wiping
his
eyes
i
very
sorry
he
said
i
sure
i
do
know
what
i
was
laughing
for
slim
whistled
well
said
wag
what
i
him
of
course
and
you
know
perfectly
well
oh
was
i
well
perhaps
you
tell
me
what
there
is
to
laugh
at
about
him
said
wag
rather
basely
i
thought
so
as
slim
put
his
finger
to
his
lip
and
looked
unhappy
i
interrupted
get
up
a
minute
wag
i
said
i
want
to
see
something
what
said
he
jumping
up
at
once
stand
back
to
back
with
slim
if
you
do
mind
that
it
dear
me
i
thought
you
were
taller
than
that
you
looked
to
me
taller
last
night
my
mistake
i
dare
say
all
right
thanks
but
there
they
stood
gazing
at
each
other
with
horror
and
i
felt
i
had
been
trifling
with
a
most
serious
subject
so
i
laughed
and
said
do
disturb
yourselves
i
was
only
chaffing
you
wag
because
you
seemed
to
be
doing
something
of
the
kind
to
me
slim
understood
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
wag
sat
down
on
a
book
and
looked
reproachfully
upon
me
neither
said
a
word
i
was
very
much
ashamed
and
begged
their
pardon
as
nicely
as
i
knew
how
luckily
wag
was
soon
convinced
that
i
was
not
in
earnest
and
he
recovered
his
spirits
directly
all
he
said
nodding
at
me
did
i
hear
you
say
you
like
earwigs
that
worth
remembering
slim
this
reduced
me
at
once
i
tried
to
point
out
that
he
had
begun
it
and
that
it
would
be
a
mean
revenge
and
very
hard
on
the
earwigs
if
he
filled
my
room
with
them
for
i
should
be
obliged
to
kill
all
i
could
why
he
said
they
need
be
real
earwigs
my
own
tickle
every
bit
as
much
as
real
ones
this
was
no
better
for
me
and
i
tried
to
make
more
appeals
to
his
better
feelings
he
did
not
seem
to
be
listening
very
attentively
though
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
what
that
on
your
neck
he
said
suddenly
and
at
the
same
moment
i
felt
a
procession
of
legs
walking
over
my
skin
i
brushed
at
it
hastily
and
something
seemed
to
fall
on
the
table
no
the
other
side
i
mean
said
he
and
again
i
felt
the
same
horrid
tickling
and
went
through
the
same
exercises
with
a
face
i
no
doubt
contorted
with
terror
anyhow
it
seemed
to
amuse
them
very
much
wag
in
fact
was
quite
unable
to
speak
and
could
only
point
it
was
dull
of
me
not
to
have
realized
at
once
that
these
were
his
earwigs
and
not
real
ones
but
now
i
did
and
though
i
still
felt
the
tickling
i
did
not
move
but
sat
down
and
gazed
severely
at
him
soon
he
got
the
better
of
his
mirth
and
said
i
think
we
are
quits
now
then
with
sudden
alarm
i
say
what
become
of
the
others
the
bell
has
gone
has
it
how
should
i
know
i
said
if
you
had
been
making
all
this
disturbance
perhaps
we
might
have
heard
it
he
took
a
flying
leap
an
extraordinary
feat
it
was
from
the
edge
of
the
table
to
a
chair
in
the
window
scrambled
up
to
the
sill
and
gazed
out
it
all
right
he
said
in
a
faint
voice
of
infinite
relief
let
himself
down
limply
to
the
floor
and
climbed
slowly
up
my
leg
to
his
former
place
well
i
said
the
bell
has
gone
it
seems
but
where
are
the
rest
i
hardly
seen
anything
of
them
oh
go
and
find
slim
i
worn
out
with
all
these
frights
slim
went
to
the
farther
end
of
the
table
prospected
and
returned
he
reported
them
all
right
but
they
having
rather
a
slow
time
of
it
i
think
i
too
got
up
walked
round
and
looked
they
were
seated
in
a
solemn
circle
on
the
floor
round
the
cat
who
was
now
curled
up
and
fast
asleep
on
a
round
footstool
not
a
word
was
being
said
by
anybody
i
thought
i
had
better
address
them
so
i
said
gentlemen
i
afraid
i
been
very
inattentive
to
you
this
evening
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
amuse
you
wo
you
come
up
on
the
table
you
welcome
to
walk
up
my
leg
if
you
find
that
convenient
i
was
almost
sorry
i
had
spoken
the
moment
after
for
they
made
but
one
rush
at
my
legs
as
i
stood
by
the
table
and
the
sensation
was
rather
like
that
i
imagine
of
a
swarm
of
rats
climbing
up
one
trousers
however
it
was
over
in
a
few
seconds
and
all
of
them
over
a
dozen
were
with
wag
and
slim
on
the
table
except
one
who
whether
by
mistake
or
on
purpose
went
on
climbing
me
by
way
of
my
waistcoat
buttons
rather
deliberately
until
he
reached
my
shoulder
i
object
of
course
but
i
turned
round
which
made
him
catch
at
my
ear
and
went
back
to
my
chair
seated
in
which
i
felt
rather
as
if
i
was
presiding
at
a
meeting
the
one
on
my
shoulder
sat
down
and
i
thought
folded
his
arms
and
looked
at
his
friends
with
some
triumph
wag
evidently
took
this
to
be
a
liberty
my
word
he
said
what
do
you
mean
by
it
wisp
come
off
it
wisp
was
a
little
daunted
as
i
judged
by
his
fidgeting
somewhat
but
put
a
bold
face
on
it
and
said
why
should
i
come
off
i
put
in
a
word
i
do
mind
his
being
here
i
dare
say
not
that
not
the
point
said
wag
are
you
coming
down
no
said
wisp
not
for
you
but
his
tone
was
rather
blustering
than
brave
very
well
do
then
said
wag
and
i
expected
him
to
run
up
and
pull
wisp
down
by
the
legs
but
he
did
do
that
he
took
something
out
of
the
breast
of
his
tunic
put
it
in
his
mouth
lay
down
on
his
stomach
and
with
his
eyes
on
wisp
puffed
out
his
cheeks
two
or
three
seconds
passed
during
which
i
felt
wisp
shifting
about
on
his
perch
and
breathing
quickly
then
he
gave
a
sharp
shriek
which
went
right
through
my
head
slipped
rapidly
down
my
chest
and
legs
and
on
to
the
floor
where
he
continued
to
squeal
and
to
run
about
like
a
mad
thing
to
the
great
amusement
of
everyone
on
the
table
then
i
saw
what
was
the
matter
all
round
his
head
were
a
multitude
of
little
sparks
which
flew
about
him
like
a
swarm
of
bees
every
now
and
then
settling
and
coming
off
again
and
i
suppose
burning
him
every
time
if
he
beat
them
off
they
attacked
his
hands
so
he
was
in
a
bad
way
after
watching
him
for
about
a
minute
from
the
edge
of
the
table
wag
called
out
do
you
apologize
yes
he
screamed
all
right
said
wag
stand
still
stand
still
you
bat
how
can
i
get
back
if
you
do
wag
was
back
to
me
and
i
could
see
what
he
did
but
wisp
sat
down
on
the
carpet
free
of
sparks
and
wiped
his
face
and
neck
with
his
handkerchief
for
some
time
while
the
rest
gradually
recovered
from
their
laughter
you
can
come
up
again
now
said
wag
and
so
he
did
though
he
was
slow
and
shy
about
it
why
did
he
send
sparks
at
wag
said
i
to
slim
he
has
got
to
send
was
the
answer
it
only
the
captain
of
the
moon
well
now
what
about
a
little
peace
and
quiet
i
said
and
you
know
i
never
been
introduced
to
you
all
properly
would
it
be
a
good
idea
to
do
that
before
the
bell
goes
very
well
said
wag
we
it
properly
you
bring
up
one
at
a
time
slim
and
to
me
you
put
your
out
on
the
table
yes
do
you
know
he
held
up
his
right
hand
then
his
left
and
so
on
thank
you
this
was
done
and
meanwhile
slim
formed
the
troop
into
a
queue
and
beckoned
them
up
one
by
one
wag
stood
on
a
book
on
the
right
and
proclaimed
the
name
of
each
first
he
had
made
me
arrange
my
right
hand
edgeways
on
the
table
with
the
forefinger
out
then
gold
said
wag
gold
stepped
forward
and
made
a
lovely
bow
which
i
returned
with
an
inclination
of
my
head
then
took
as
much
of
my
forefinger
top
joint
in
his
right
hand
as
he
could
manage
bent
over
it
and
shook
it
or
tried
to
and
then
took
up
a
position
on
the
left
and
watched
the
next
comer
the
ceremony
was
the
same
for
everyone
but
not
all
the
bows
were
equally
elegant
some
of
the
boys
were
jocular
and
shook
my
finger
with
both
hands
and
a
great
display
of
effort
these
were
frowned
upon
by
wag
the
names
i
need
not
set
them
all
down
now
were
all
of
the
same
kind
as
you
have
heard
there
was
red
wise
dart
sprat
and
so
on
after
wisp
who
came
last
and
was
rather
humble
wag
called
out
slim
and
after
him
descended
and
presented
himself
in
the
same
form
and
now
he
said
perhaps
you
tell
us
name
i
did
so
one
is
always
a
little
shamefaced
about
it
i
do
know
why
in
full
he
whistled
too
much
he
said
what
the
easiest
you
can
do
after
some
thought
i
said
what
about
m
or
n
much
better
if
m
all
right
for
you
it
do
for
us
so
m
was
agreed
upon
i
was
still
rather
afraid
that
the
rank
and
file
had
been
passing
a
dull
evening
and
would
not
come
again
and
i
tried
to
express
as
much
to
them
but
they
said
dull
oh
no
m
why
we
found
out
all
sorts
of
things
really
what
sort
of
things
well
inside
the
wall
in
that
corner
there
the
biggest
spider
ever
seen
for
one
thing
good
gracious
i
said
i
hate
i
hope
it
ca
get
out
it
would
have
if
we
had
stopped
up
the
hole
been
helping
it
to
gnaw
through
has
it
said
wag
my
word
that
looks
bad
what
was
it
made
the
hole
some
called
out
a
bat
and
some
a
rat
it
does
matter
much
for
that
said
slim
so
long
as
it
safe
now
where
is
it
gone
down
to
the
bottom
and
saying
awful
things
red
answered
well
i
obliged
to
you
i
said
anything
else
there
a
lot
of
this
stuff
under
the
floor
said
dart
pointing
with
his
foot
at
a
which
lay
on
the
table
is
there
whereabouts
said
i
oh
but
i
was
forgetting
i
can
look
after
that
myself
yes
of
course
you
can
they
said
and
lots
of
things
happened
here
before
you
came
we
were
watching
the
old
man
and
the
woman
they
were
the
worst
were
they
red
do
you
mean
you
been
here
before
i
asked
no
no
but
we
were
looking
at
them
like
we
do
at
school
this
was
beyond
me
and
i
thought
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
ask
for
more
explanations
besides
just
at
this
moment
we
heard
the
bell
they
all
clambered
down
either
me
or
the
chairs
or
the
tablecloth
slim
lingered
a
moment
to
say
you
look
out
wo
you
and
then
followed
the
rest
on
to
the
where
taking
the
time
from
captain
wag
they
all
stood
in
a
row
bowed
with
their
caps
off
straightened
up
again
each
sang
one
note
which
combined
into
a
wonderful
chord
faced
round
and
disappeared
i
followed
them
to
the
window
and
saw
the
inhabitants
of
the
house
separating
and
going
to
their
homes
with
the
young
ones
capering
round
them
one
or
two
of
the
elders
wag
father
in
particular
looked
up
at
me
paused
in
their
walk
and
bowed
gravely
which
courtesy
i
returned
i
went
on
gazing
until
the
lawn
was
a
blank
once
more
and
then
closing
and
fastening
the
window
i
betook
myself
to
the
bedroom
vii
the
it
had
certainly
been
an
eventful
day
and
evening
and
i
felt
that
my
adventures
could
not
be
quite
at
an
end
yet
for
i
had
still
to
find
out
what
new
power
or
sense
the
fourth
jar
had
brought
me
i
stood
and
thought
and
tried
quite
vainly
to
detect
some
difference
in
myself
and
then
i
went
to
the
window
and
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
looked
out
on
the
road
and
within
a
few
minutes
i
began
to
understand
there
came
walking
rapidly
along
the
road
a
young
man
and
he
turned
in
at
the
garden
gate
and
came
straight
up
the
path
to
the
house
door
i
began
to
be
surprised
not
at
his
coming
for
it
was
not
so
very
late
but
at
the
look
of
him
he
was
young
as
i
said
rather
but
not
of
the
class
of
a
farmer
i
thought
he
wore
biggish
brown
whiskers
which
is
not
common
nowadays
and
his
hair
was
rather
long
at
the
back
which
also
is
not
common
with
young
men
who
want
to
look
smart
but
his
hat
and
his
clothes
generally
were
the
really
odd
part
of
him
the
hat
was
a
sort
of
low
with
a
curved
brim
it
spread
out
at
the
top
and
it
was
brushed
rough
instead
of
smooth
his
coat
was
a
blue
with
brass
buttons
he
had
a
broad
tie
wound
round
and
round
his
neck
and
a
gladstone
collar
his
trousers
were
tight
all
the
way
down
and
had
straps
under
his
feet
to
put
it
in
the
dullest
shortest
way
he
was
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
eighty
or
ninety
years
ago
as
we
read
in
the
ghost
stories
evidently
he
knew
his
way
about
very
well
he
came
straight
up
to
the
front
door
and
as
far
as
i
could
tell
into
the
house
but
i
did
not
hear
the
door
open
or
shut
or
any
steps
on
the
stairs
he
must
i
thought
be
in
my
landlady
parlour
downstairs
i
turned
away
from
the
window
and
there
was
the
next
surprise
it
was
as
if
there
was
no
wall
between
me
and
the
i
saw
straight
into
it
there
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
and
by
it
were
sitting
face
to
face
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
i
thought
at
once
of
what
one
of
the
boys
had
said
and
i
looked
curiously
at
them
they
were
you
would
have
said
as
fine
specimens
of
an
yeoman
and
his
wife
as
anyone
could
wish
to
see
the
man
was
hale
and
with
grey
whiskers
smiling
as
he
sat
bolt
upright
in
his
the
old
lady
was
rosy
and
smiling
too
with
a
smart
silk
dress
and
a
smart
cap
and
tidy
ringlets
on
each
side
of
her
face
a
regular
picture
of
wholesome
old
age
and
yet
i
hated
them
both
the
young
man
their
son
i
suppose
was
in
the
room
standing
at
the
door
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
looking
timidly
at
them
the
old
man
turned
half
round
in
his
chair
looked
at
him
turned
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
looked
across
at
the
old
lady
and
they
both
smiled
as
if
they
were
amused
the
son
came
farther
into
the
room
put
his
hat
down
leaned
with
both
hands
on
the
table
and
began
to
speak
though
nothing
could
be
heard
with
an
earnestness
that
was
painful
to
see
because
i
could
be
certain
his
pleading
would
be
of
no
use
sometimes
he
spread
out
his
hands
and
shook
them
every
now
and
again
he
brushed
his
eyes
he
was
very
much
moved
and
so
was
i
merely
watching
him
the
old
people
were
not
they
leaned
forward
a
little
in
their
chairs
and
sometimes
smiled
at
each
other
again
as
if
they
were
amused
at
last
he
had
done
and
stood
with
his
hands
before
him
quivering
all
over
his
father
and
mother
leaned
back
in
their
chairs
and
looked
at
each
other
i
think
they
said
not
a
single
word
the
son
caught
up
his
hat
turned
round
and
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
then
the
old
man
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
and
the
old
lady
laughed
too
not
so
boisterously
i
turned
back
to
the
window
it
was
as
i
expected
outside
the
garden
gate
in
the
road
a
young
slight
girl
in
a
large
and
shawl
and
rather
dress
was
waiting
in
great
anxiety
as
i
could
see
by
the
way
she
held
to
the
railings
her
face
i
could
not
see
the
young
man
came
out
she
clasped
her
hands
he
shook
his
head
they
went
off
together
slowly
up
the
road
he
with
bowed
shoulders
supporting
her
she
i
dare
say
crying
again
i
looked
round
to
the
the
wall
hid
it
now
it
sounds
a
dull
ordinary
scene
enough
but
i
can
assure
you
it
was
horribly
disturbing
to
watch
and
the
cruel
calm
way
in
which
the
father
and
mother
who
looked
so
nice
and
worthy
and
were
so
abominable
treated
their
son
was
like
nothing
i
had
ever
seen
of
course
i
know
now
what
the
effect
of
the
fourth
jar
was
it
made
me
able
to
see
what
had
happened
in
any
place
i
did
not
yet
know
how
far
back
the
memories
would
go
or
whether
i
was
obliged
to
see
them
if
i
did
not
want
to
but
it
was
clear
to
me
that
the
boys
were
sometimes
taught
in
this
way
we
were
watching
them
like
we
do
at
school
one
of
them
said
and
though
the
grammar
was
poor
the
meaning
was
plain
and
i
would
ask
slim
about
it
when
we
next
met
meanwhile
i
must
say
i
hoped
the
gift
would
not
go
on
working
instead
of
letting
me
go
to
sleep
it
did
not
next
day
i
met
my
landlady
employing
herself
in
the
garden
and
asked
her
about
the
people
who
had
formerly
lived
in
the
house
oh
yes
said
she
i
can
tell
you
about
them
for
my
father
he
remembered
old
and
eld
quite
well
when
he
was
a
slip
of
a
lad
they
was
liked
in
the
place
neither
of
them
partly
through
bein
so
to
their
workpeople
and
partly
from
them
treating
their
only
son
so
bad
i
mean
to
say
turning
him
right
off
because
he
married
without
asking
permission
well
no
doubt
that
what
he
should
have
done
but
my
father
said
it
was
a
very
nice
respectable
young
girl
he
married
and
it
do
seem
hard
for
them
never
to
say
a
word
of
kindness
all
those
years
and
leave
every
penny
away
from
the
young
people
what
become
of
them
do
you
say
sir
why
i
believe
they
emigrated
away
to
the
united
states
of
america
and
never
was
heard
of
again
but
the
old
people
they
lived
on
here
and
i
never
heard
but
what
they
was
easy
in
their
minds
right
up
to
the
day
of
their
death
old
people
they
was
too
my
father
used
to
say
seemed
as
if
butter
would
melt
in
their
mouths
as
the
saying
is
now
i
do
know
when
i
thought
of
them
last
but
i
recollect
my
father
speaking
of
them
as
well
and
the
way
they
spoke
of
on
their
stone
that
lays
just
to
the
side
as
you
go
up
the
churchyard
path
well
you
think
there
never
was
such
people
but
i
believe
that
was
put
up
by
them
that
got
the
property
now
what
was
that
name
again
but
about
that
time
i
thought
i
must
be
getting
on
i
also
thought
as
before
that
it
would
be
well
for
me
not
to
go
very
far
away
from
the
house
as
i
strolled
up
the
road
i
pondered
over
the
message
which
wag
father
had
been
so
good
as
to
send
me
if
they
about
the
house
give
them
horseshoes
if
there
a
squirt
at
it
i
think
there
a
squirt
in
the
all
very
well
no
doubt
i
had
one
horseshoe
but
that
was
not
much
and
i
could
explore
the
and
borrow
the
garden
squirt
but
more
horseshoes
at
that
moment
i
heard
a
squeak
and
a
rustle
in
the
hedge
and
could
not
help
poking
my
stick
into
it
to
see
what
had
made
the
noise
the
stick
clinked
against
something
with
its
iron
ferrule
an
old
horseshoe
evidently
shown
to
me
on
purpose
by
a
friendly
creature
i
picked
it
up
and
not
to
make
a
long
story
of
it
i
was
helped
by
much
the
same
devices
to
increase
my
collection
to
four
and
now
i
felt
it
would
be
wise
to
turn
back
as
i
turned
into
the
back
garden
and
came
in
sight
of
the
little
or
or
whatever
it
was
i
started
someone
was
just
coming
out
of
it
i
gave
a
loud
cough
the
party
turned
round
hastily
it
was
an
old
man
in
a
sleeved
waistcoat
made
up
i
thought
to
look
like
an
odd
man
he
touched
his
hat
civilly
enough
and
showed
no
surprise
but
oh
horror
he
held
in
his
hand
the
garden
squirt
morning
i
said
going
to
do
a
bit
of
watering
he
grinned
just
stepped
up
to
borrer
this
off
the
lady
there
a
lot
of
fly
gets
on
the
plants
this
weather
i
dare
say
there
is
by
the
way
what
a
lot
of
horseshoes
you
people
leave
about
how
many
do
you
think
i
picked
up
this
morning
just
along
the
road
look
here
and
i
held
one
out
to
him
and
his
hand
came
slowly
out
to
meet
it
as
though
he
could
not
keep
it
back
his
face
wrinkled
up
into
a
horrible
scowl
and
what
he
was
going
to
say
i
do
know
but
just
then
his
hand
clutched
the
horseshoe
and
he
gave
a
shout
of
pain
dropped
the
squirt
and
the
horseshoe
whipped
round
as
quick
as
any
young
man
could
and
was
off
round
the
corner
of
the
shed
before
i
had
really
taken
in
what
was
happening
before
i
tried
to
see
what
had
become
of
him
i
snatched
up
the
squirt
and
the
horseshoe
and
almost
dropped
them
again
both
were
pretty
hot
the
squirt
much
the
hotter
of
the
two
but
both
of
them
cooled
down
in
a
few
seconds
by
that
time
my
old
man
was
completely
out
of
sight
and
i
should
not
wonder
if
he
was
away
some
time
for
perhaps
you
know
and
perhaps
you
do
know
the
effect
of
an
old
horseshoe
on
that
sort
of
people
not
only
is
it
of
iron
which
they
ca
abide
but
when
they
see
or
still
more
touch
the
shoe
they
have
to
go
over
all
the
ground
that
the
shoe
went
over
since
it
was
last
in
the
blacksmith
hands
only
i
doubt
if
the
same
shoe
will
work
for
more
than
one
witch
or
wizard
anyway
i
put
that
one
aside
when
i
went
indoors
and
then
i
sat
and
wondered
what
would
come
next
and
how
i
could
best
prepare
for
it
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
do
no
harm
to
put
one
of
the
shoes
where
it
could
be
seen
at
once
and
it
also
struck
me
that
under
the
rug
just
inside
the
bedroom
door
would
not
be
a
bad
place
so
there
i
put
it
and
then
fell
to
smoking
and
reading
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
said
i
a
little
curious
but
no
it
was
only
the
maid
as
she
passed
me
which
she
did
quickly
i
heard
her
mutter
something
about
for
the
wash
and
i
thought
there
was
something
not
quite
usual
about
the
voice
so
i
looked
round
she
was
back
to
me
but
the
dress
and
the
height
and
the
hair
was
what
i
was
accustomed
to
see
into
the
bedroom
she
hurried
and
the
next
thing
was
a
scream
like
that
of
at
least
two
cats
in
agony
i
could
just
see
her
leap
into
the
air
come
down
again
on
the
rug
scream
again
and
then
bundle
hopping
limping
i
do
know
what
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
i
did
catch
sight
of
her
feet
though
they
were
bare
they
were
greenish
and
they
were
webbed
and
i
think
there
were
some
large
white
blisters
on
the
soles
of
them
you
would
have
thought
that
the
commotion
would
have
brought
the
household
about
my
ears
but
it
did
not
and
i
can
only
suppose
that
they
heard
no
more
of
it
than
they
did
of
the
things
which
the
birds
and
so
on
say
to
each
other
next
please
said
i
as
i
lighted
a
pipe
but
if
you
will
believe
it
there
was
no
next
lunch
the
afternoon
tea
all
passed
by
and
i
was
completely
undisturbed
they
must
be
saving
up
for
the
i
thought
what
in
the
world
can
it
be
as
came
on
and
the
moon
began
to
make
herself
felt
i
took
up
my
old
position
at
the
window
with
the
garden
squirt
at
hand
and
two
full
jugs
of
water
on
the
floor
plenty
more
to
be
got
from
the
bathroom
if
wanted
the
leaden
box
of
the
five
jars
was
in
the
right
place
for
the
moonbeams
to
fall
on
it
but
no
moonbeams
would
touch
it
why
was
this
there
were
no
clouds
yet
between
the
orb
of
the
moon
and
my
box
there
was
some
obstruction
high
up
in
the
sky
was
a
dancing
film
thick
enough
to
cast
a
shadow
on
the
area
of
the
window
and
ever
as
the
moon
rode
higher
in
the
heavens
this
obstruction
became
more
solid
it
seemed
gradually
to
get
its
bearings
and
settle
into
the
place
where
it
would
shut
off
the
light
from
the
box
most
completely
i
began
to
guess
it
was
the
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
dense
cloud
of
bats
gradually
forming
itself
into
a
solid
ball
and
coming
lower
and
nearer
to
my
window
soon
they
were
only
about
thirty
feet
off
and
i
felt
that
the
moment
was
come
i
have
never
much
liked
bats
or
desired
their
company
and
now
as
i
studied
them
through
the
glass
and
saw
their
horrid
little
wicked
faces
and
winking
wings
i
felt
justified
in
trying
to
make
things
as
unpleasant
for
them
as
i
could
i
charged
the
squirt
and
let
fly
and
again
and
again
as
quick
as
i
could
fill
it
the
water
spread
a
bit
before
it
reached
the
ball
but
not
too
much
to
spoil
the
effect
and
the
effect
was
almost
alarming
some
hundreds
of
bats
all
shrieking
out
at
once
and
shrieking
with
rage
and
fear
not
merely
from
the
excitement
of
chasing
flies
as
they
generally
do
dozens
of
them
dropping
away
with
wings
too
soaked
to
fly
some
on
to
the
grass
where
they
hopped
and
fluttered
and
rolled
in
ecstasies
of
passion
some
into
bushes
one
or
two
plumb
on
to
the
path
where
they
lay
motionless
that
was
the
first
tableau
then
came
a
new
feature
from
both
sides
there
darted
into
the
heart
of
the
ball
two
squadrons
of
figures
flying
at
great
speed
though
without
wings
and
perfectly
horizontal
with
arms
joined
and
straight
out
in
front
of
them
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
seven
or
eight
more
plunged
into
the
ball
from
above
as
if
taking
headers
the
boys
were
out
i
stopped
squirting
for
i
did
not
know
whether
the
water
would
fell
them
as
it
felled
the
bats
but
a
shrill
cry
rose
from
below
go
on
m
go
on
m
so
i
aimed
again
and
it
was
time
for
a
knot
of
bats
just
then
detached
itself
from
the
main
body
and
flew
towards
me
my
shot
caught
the
middle
one
on
the
snout
and
as
i
swung
the
squirt
to
left
and
right
it
disabled
four
or
five
others
and
discouraged
the
rest
meanwhile
the
ball
was
cloven
again
and
again
by
the
arms
of
the
flying
squadrons
which
shot
through
it
from
side
to
side
and
from
top
to
bottom
though
never
as
appeared
later
quite
through
the
middle
and
though
it
kept
closing
up
again
it
was
plainly
growing
smaller
as
more
and
more
of
the
bats
outside
which
were
exposed
to
the
squirt
dropped
away
i
suddenly
felt
something
alight
on
my
shoulder
and
a
voice
said
in
my
ear
wag
says
if
you
throw
a
shoe
into
the
middle
now
he
believes
it
would
finish
them
can
you
it
was
i
think
dart
who
had
been
sent
with
the
message
horseshoes
i
suppose
he
means
i
said
i
try
wait
till
we
out
of
the
way
said
dart
and
was
off
in
a
moment
more
i
heard
not
what
i
was
rather
expecting
a
horn
of
but
two
strokes
on
the
bell
i
saw
the
figures
of
the
boys
shoot
up
and
away
to
left
and
right
leaving
the
clear
and
the
bats
shrieked
aloud
i
dare
say
in
triumph
at
the
enemy
retreat
there
were
two
horseshoes
left
i
had
no
idea
how
they
would
fly
and
i
had
not
much
confidence
in
my
power
of
aiming
but
it
must
be
tried
and
i
threw
them
edgeways
like
quoits
the
first
skimmed
the
top
of
the
ball
the
second
went
straight
through
the
middle
something
which
the
bats
in
the
very
centre
were
holding
something
soft
was
pierced
by
it
and
burst
i
think
it
must
have
been
a
globe
of
stuff
in
a
thin
skin
the
contents
spurted
out
on
to
some
of
the
bats
and
seemed
to
scald
the
fur
off
them
in
an
instant
and
singe
up
all
the
membranes
of
their
wings
they
fell
down
at
once
with
broken
screams
the
rest
darted
off
in
every
direction
and
the
ball
was
gone
now
do
be
long
said
a
voice
from
the
i
thought
i
knew
what
was
meant
and
looked
to
the
leaden
casket
as
if
to
make
up
for
lost
time
the
moonbeam
had
already
made
an
opening
all
round
the
part
on
which
it
shone
and
i
had
but
to
turn
the
other
side
towards
it
not
even
very
slowly
to
get
the
whole
lid
free
after
cleansing
my
hands
in
the
water
i
made
trial
of
the
fifth
jar
and
as
i
replaced
it
a
chorus
of
applause
and
cheering
came
up
from
below
the
jars
were
mine
viii
wag
at
home
there
was
no
scrambling
up
to
the
this
time
my
visitors
shot
in
like
so
many
arrows
and
brought
up
on
their
hands
on
the
tablecloth
or
lit
on
their
feet
on
the
top
rail
of
a
or
on
my
shoulder
as
the
fancy
took
them
it
would
be
tedious
to
go
through
all
the
congratulations
and
thanks
which
i
offered
and
indeed
received
for
it
was
important
to
them
that
the
jars
should
not
get
into
wrong
hands
father
says
said
wag
who
was
sitting
on
a
book
as
usual
oh
what
fun
it
is
to
be
able
to
fly
again
and
he
darted
straight
and
level
and
butted
head
first
into
the
back
of
sprat
was
it
who
was
standing
near
the
edge
of
the
table
sprat
was
merely
propelled
into
the
air
a
foot
or
two
off
and
remained
standing
but
of
course
turned
round
and
told
wag
what
he
thought
of
him
wag
returned
contentedly
to
his
book
father
says
he
resumed
he
hopes
you
come
and
see
us
now
he
says
you
did
all
right
and
he
very
glad
the
stuff
got
spilt
because
they
take
moons
and
moons
to
get
as
much
of
it
together
again
he
says
they
meant
to
squirt
some
of
it
on
you
when
they
got
near
enough
and
while
you
were
trying
to
get
it
off
they
have
got
hold
of
he
pointed
to
the
box
of
jars
there
was
a
shyness
about
mentioning
it
your
father
very
kind
i
said
and
i
hope
you
thank
him
from
me
but
i
do
quite
see
how
i
to
get
into
your
house
fancy
you
not
knowing
that
said
wag
i
tell
him
you
come
and
he
was
out
of
the
window
as
usual
i
had
recourse
to
slim
why
you
did
put
some
on
your
chest
did
you
was
slim
question
yes
but
nothing
came
of
it
well
i
believe
you
can
go
pretty
well
anywhere
with
that
if
you
think
you
can
can
i
fly
then
no
i
should
say
not
i
mean
if
you
could
fly
before
you
now
how
do
you
fly
i
do
see
any
wings
no
we
never
have
wings
and
i
rather
glad
we
do
the
things
that
have
them
are
always
going
wrong
somehow
we
just
work
it
in
the
proper
way
with
our
backs
and
there
you
are
like
this
he
made
a
slight
movement
of
his
shoulders
and
was
standing
in
the
air
an
inch
off
the
table
you
never
tried
that
i
suppose
he
went
on
no
i
said
only
in
dreams
which
evidently
meant
nothing
to
him
well
now
i
said
do
you
tell
me
that
if
i
went
to
wag
house
now
i
could
get
inside
it
look
at
the
size
i
am
it
does
look
as
if
you
could
he
agreed
but
my
father
said
just
the
same
as
wag
father
about
it
here
wag
shot
on
to
my
shoulder
are
you
coming
yes
if
i
knew
how
well
come
and
try
anyhow
very
well
as
you
please
anything
to
oblige
i
picked
up
a
hat
and
went
downstairs
all
the
rest
followed
if
you
can
call
it
following
when
there
was
at
least
as
much
flying
up
steps
and
in
and
out
of
banisters
as
going
down
when
we
were
out
on
the
path
wag
said
with
more
seriousness
than
usual
now
you
do
mean
to
come
into
our
house
do
you
certainly
i
do
if
you
wish
me
to
then
that
all
right
this
way
there
father
we
were
on
the
grass
now
and
very
long
it
was
and
nice
and
wet
i
thought
i
should
be
with
all
the
dew
as
i
looked
up
to
see
the
elder
wag
i
very
nearly
fell
over
a
large
log
which
it
was
very
careless
of
anyone
to
have
left
about
but
here
was
wag
within
a
yard
of
me
and
to
my
extreme
surprise
he
was
quite
a
sizeable
man
of
middle
height
with
a
sensible
face
in
which
i
could
see
a
strong
likeness
to
his
son
we
both
bowed
and
then
shook
hands
and
wag
was
very
complimentary
and
pleasant
about
the
occurrences
of
the
evening
we
pretty
well
got
the
mess
cleared
up
you
see
yes
do
be
alarmed
he
went
on
and
took
hold
of
my
elbow
for
he
had
no
doubt
seen
a
bewildered
look
in
my
eyes
the
fact
was
as
i
suppose
you
have
made
out
not
that
he
had
grown
to
my
size
but
that
i
had
come
down
to
his
things
right
themselves
you
have
no
difficulty
about
getting
back
when
the
time
comes
but
come
in
wo
you
you
will
expect
me
to
describe
the
house
and
the
furniture
i
shall
not
further
than
to
say
that
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
of
a
piece
with
the
fashion
in
which
the
boys
were
dressed
that
is
it
was
like
my
idea
of
a
good
citizen
house
in
queen
elizabeth
time
and
i
shall
not
describe
wag
costume
she
did
not
wear
a
ruff
anyhow
wag
who
had
been
darting
about
in
the
air
while
we
walked
to
his
home
followed
us
in
on
foot
he
now
reached
up
to
my
shoulder
slim
who
came
in
too
was
shorter
have
you
got
any
sisters
i
took
occasion
to
say
to
wag
of
course
said
he
do
you
see
oh
i
forgot
come
out
you
sillies
upon
which
there
came
forward
three
nice
little
girls
each
of
whom
was
putting
away
something
into
a
kind
of
locket
which
she
wore
round
her
neck
no
it
is
no
use
asking
me
what
dresses
were
like
none
at
all
all
i
know
is
that
they
curtsied
to
me
very
nicely
and
that
when
we
all
sat
down
the
youngest
came
and
put
herself
on
my
knee
as
if
it
was
a
matter
of
course
why
did
i
see
you
before
i
asked
her
i
suppose
because
the
flowers
were
in
our
hair
show
him
what
you
mean
my
dear
said
her
father
he
does
know
our
ways
yet
accordingly
she
opened
her
locket
and
took
out
of
it
a
small
blue
flower
looking
as
if
it
was
made
of
enamel
and
stuck
it
in
her
hair
over
her
forehead
as
she
did
so
she
vanished
but
i
could
still
feel
the
weight
of
her
on
my
knee
when
she
took
it
out
again
as
no
doubt
she
did
she
became
visible
put
it
back
in
the
locket
and
smiled
agreeably
at
me
naturally
i
had
a
good
many
questions
to
ask
about
this
but
you
will
hardly
expect
me
to
put
them
all
down
becoming
invisible
in
this
way
was
a
privilege
which
the
girls
always
had
till
they
were
grown
up
and
i
suppose
i
may
say
came
out
of
course
if
they
presumed
on
it
the
lockets
were
taken
away
for
the
time
being
just
in
the
same
way
as
the
boys
were
sometimes
stopped
from
flying
as
we
have
seen
but
their
own
families
could
always
see
them
or
at
any
rate
the
flowers
in
their
hair
and
they
could
always
see
each
other
but
dear
me
how
much
am
i
to
tell
of
the
conversation
of
that
evening
one
part
at
least
i
remembered
to
ask
about
the
pictures
of
the
things
that
had
happened
in
former
times
in
places
where
i
chanced
to
be
was
i
obliged
to
see
them
whether
they
were
pleasant
or
horrible
oh
no
they
said
if
you
shut
your
eyes
from
below
that
meant
pushing
up
the
lower
eyelids
you
would
be
rid
of
them
and
you
would
only
begin
seeing
them
either
if
you
wanted
to
or
else
if
you
left
your
mind
quite
blank
and
were
thinking
of
nothing
in
particular
then
they
would
begin
to
come
and
there
was
no
knowing
how
old
they
might
be
that
depended
on
how
angry
or
excited
or
happy
or
sad
the
people
had
been
to
whom
they
happened
and
that
reminds
me
of
another
thing
wag
had
got
rather
fidgety
while
we
were
talking
and
was
flying
up
to
the
ceiling
and
down
again
and
walking
on
his
hands
and
so
forth
when
his
mother
said
dear
do
be
quiet
why
do
you
take
a
glass
and
amuse
yourself
with
it
here
the
key
of
the
cupboard
she
threw
it
to
him
and
he
caught
it
and
ran
to
a
tall
bureau
opposite
and
unlocked
it
after
humming
and
flitting
about
in
front
of
it
for
a
little
time
he
pulled
a
thing
like
a
slate
off
a
shelf
where
there
were
a
large
number
of
them
what
have
you
got
said
his
mother
the
one
i
did
get
to
the
end
of
yesterday
about
the
dragon
oh
that
a
very
good
one
said
she
i
used
to
be
very
fond
of
that
i
liked
it
awfully
as
far
as
i
got
he
said
and
was
betaking
himself
to
a
settle
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
when
i
asked
if
i
might
see
it
and
he
brought
it
to
me
it
was
just
like
a
small
in
a
frame
and
the
frame
had
one
or
two
buttons
or
little
knobs
on
it
wag
put
it
into
my
hand
and
then
got
behind
me
and
put
his
chin
on
my
shoulder
that
where
i
got
to
he
said
he
just
going
out
through
the
forest
i
thought
at
the
first
glance
that
i
was
looking
at
a
very
good
copy
of
a
picture
it
was
a
knight
on
horseback
in
and
the
armour
looked
as
if
it
had
really
seen
service
the
horse
was
a
massive
white
beast
rather
of
the
type
but
not
so
hairy
in
the
hoof
the
background
was
a
wood
chiefly
of
but
the
undergrowth
was
wonderfully
painted
i
felt
that
if
i
looked
into
it
i
should
see
every
blade
of
grass
and
every
ready
said
wag
and
reached
over
and
moved
one
of
the
knobs
the
knight
shook
his
rein
and
the
horse
began
to
move
at
a
well
but
he
ca
anything
wag
said
his
father
i
thought
you
wanted
to
be
quiet
said
wag
but
we
have
it
aloud
if
you
like
he
slid
aside
another
knob
and
i
began
to
hear
the
tread
of
the
horse
and
the
creaking
of
the
saddle
and
the
chink
of
the
armour
as
well
as
a
rising
breeze
which
now
came
sighing
through
the
wood
like
a
cinema
you
will
say
of
course
well
it
was
but
there
was
colour
and
sound
and
you
could
hold
it
in
your
hand
and
it
was
a
photograph
but
the
live
thing
which
you
could
stop
at
pleasure
and
look
into
every
detail
of
it
well
i
went
on
reading
as
you
may
say
this
glass
in
a
theatre
you
know
if
you
saw
a
knight
riding
through
a
forest
the
effect
would
be
managed
by
making
the
scenery
slide
backwards
past
him
and
in
a
cinema
it
could
all
be
shortened
up
by
increasing
the
pace
or
leaving
out
part
of
the
film
here
it
was
not
like
that
we
seemed
to
be
keeping
pace
and
going
along
with
the
knight
presently
he
began
to
sing
he
had
a
loud
voice
and
uttered
his
words
crisply
so
that
i
had
no
difficulty
in
making
out
the
song
it
was
about
a
lady
who
was
very
proud
and
haughty
to
him
and
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
his
suit
and
it
declared
that
the
only
thing
left
for
him
was
to
lay
himself
down
under
a
tree
but
he
seemed
quite
cheerful
about
it
and
indeed
neither
his
complexion
nor
the
glance
of
his
eye
gave
any
sign
that
he
was
suffering
the
pangs
of
hopeless
love
suddenly
his
horse
stopped
short
and
snorted
uneasily
the
knight
left
off
singing
in
the
middle
of
a
verse
looked
earnestly
into
the
wood
at
the
back
of
the
picture
and
then
out
towards
us
and
then
behind
him
he
patted
his
horse
neck
and
then
humming
to
himself
put
on
his
gauntlets
which
were
hanging
at
his
saddle
bow
managed
somehow
to
latch
or
bolt
the
fastenings
of
them
slipped
down
his
visor
and
took
the
hilt
of
his
sword
in
one
hand
and
the
sheath
in
the
other
and
loosened
the
blade
in
the
sheath
he
had
hardly
done
this
when
the
horse
shied
violently
and
reared
and
out
of
the
thicket
on
the
near
side
of
the
road
i
suppose
something
shot
up
in
front
of
him
on
the
saddle
we
all
drew
in
our
breath
do
be
frightened
dear
said
wag
to
the
youngest
girl
who
had
given
a
sort
of
jump
he
quite
safe
this
time
i
must
say
it
did
not
look
like
it
the
beast
that
had
leapt
on
to
the
saddle
was
tearing
with
its
claws
drawing
back
its
head
and
driving
it
forward
again
with
horrid
force
against
the
visor
and
was
at
such
close
quarters
that
the
knight
could
not
possibly
either
draw
or
use
his
sword
it
was
a
horrible
beast
too
evidently
a
young
dragon
as
it
sat
on
the
its
head
was
just
about
on
a
level
with
the
knight
it
had
four
short
legs
with
long
toes
and
claws
it
clung
to
the
saddle
with
the
hind
feet
and
tore
with
the
fore
feet
as
i
said
its
head
was
rather
long
and
had
two
pointed
ears
and
two
small
sharp
horns
besides
it
had
bat
wings
with
which
it
buffeted
the
knight
but
its
tail
was
short
i
do
know
whether
it
had
been
bitten
or
cut
off
in
some
previous
fight
it
was
all
of
a
colour
the
knight
was
for
the
moment
having
a
bad
time
of
it
for
the
horse
was
plunging
and
the
dragon
doing
its
very
worst
the
crisis
was
not
long
though
the
knight
took
hold
of
the
right
wing
with
both
hands
and
tore
the
membrane
upwards
to
the
root
like
parchment
it
bled
yellow
blood
and
the
dragon
gave
a
grating
scream
then
he
clutched
it
hard
by
the
neck
and
managed
to
wrench
it
away
from
its
hold
on
the
saddle
and
when
it
was
in
the
air
he
whirled
its
body
heavy
as
it
was
first
over
his
back
and
then
forwards
again
and
its
i
suppose
broke
for
it
was
quite
limp
when
he
cast
it
down
he
looked
down
at
it
for
a
little
and
seeing
it
stir
he
got
off
with
the
rein
over
his
arm
drew
his
sword
cut
the
head
off
and
kicked
it
away
some
yards
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
push
up
his
visor
look
upward
mutter
something
i
could
not
well
hear
and
cross
himself
after
which
he
said
aloud
where
man
finds
one
of
a
brood
he
may
look
for
more
mounted
turned
his
horse
head
and
galloped
off
the
way
he
had
come
we
had
not
followed
him
far
through
the
wood
when
bother
said
wag
there
the
bell
and
he
reached
over
and
slid
back
the
knobs
in
the
frame
and
the
knight
stopped
i
was
full
of
questions
but
there
was
no
time
to
put
them
had
to
be
said
quickly
and
father
wag
saw
me
out
of
the
front
door
i
set
out
on
what
seemed
a
considerable
walk
across
the
rough
grass
towards
the
enormous
building
in
which
i
lived
i
suppose
i
did
not
really
take
many
minutes
about
getting
to
the
path
and
as
i
stepped
on
to
it
rather
carefully
for
it
was
a
longish
way
down
why
without
any
shock
or
any
odd
feeling
i
was
my
own
size
again
and
i
went
to
bed
pondering
much
upon
the
events
of
the
day
well
i
began
this
communication
by
saying
that
i
was
going
to
explain
to
you
how
it
was
that
i
heard
something
from
the
owls
and
i
think
i
have
explained
how
it
is
that
i
am
able
to
say
that
i
have
done
so
exactly
what
it
was
that
you
and
i
were
talking
about
when
i
mentioned
the
owls
i
dare
say
neither
of
us
remembers
as
you
can
see
i
have
had
more
exciting
experiences
than
merely
conversing
with
them
interesting
and
i
think
unusual
as
that
is
i
have
not
of
course
told
you
nearly
all
there
is
to
tell
but
perhaps
i
have
said
enough
for
the
present
more
if
you
should
wish
it
another
time
as
to
present
conditions
there
is
a
slight
coolness
between
wisp
and
the
cat
he
made
his
way
into
a
which
she
was
watching
and
enticed
her
close
up
to
it
by
scratchings
and
other
sounds
and
then
when
she
came
quite
near
taking
great
trouble
of
course
to
make
no
noise
whatever
he
put
his
head
out
and
blew
in
her
face
which
affronted
her
very
much
however
i
believe
i
have
persuaded
her
that
he
meant
no
harm
the
room
