preface
many
years
ago
an
english
translation
of
the
first
part
of
this
charming
tale
appeared
and
few
books
have
obtained
such
deserved
popularity
the
gradual
progress
of
the
family
from
utter
destitution
and
misery
to
happiness
and
abundance
arising
from
their
own
labour
perseverance
and
obedience
together
with
the
effect
produced
on
the
different
characters
of
the
sons
by
the
stirring
adventures
they
met
with
created
a
deep
and
absorbing
interest
every
young
reader
patronized
either
the
noble
fritz
the
studious
ernest
or
the
generous
jack
and
regarded
him
as
a
familiar
personal
acquaintance
the
book
had
but
one
defect
the
death
of
the
talented
author
left
it
unfinished
and
every
reader
regretted
its
abrupt
termination
this
conclusion
was
happily
supplied
by
one
of
the
most
accomplished
and
elegant
writers
of
her
day
the
baroness
de
montolieu
and
sanctioned
and
approved
by
the
son
of
the
lamented
author
the
entire
work
was
published
in
france
and
has
for
many
years
held
a
distinguished
rank
in
the
juvenile
libraries
there
for
the
gratification
of
a
little
family
circle
this
now
appears
in
english
and
as
on
examining
the
first
part
in
the
original
it
was
found
that
some
new
discoveries
might
be
made
it
was
thought
best
to
it
subduing
the
tone
of
the
whole
to
english
taste
the
unanimous
voices
of
the
beloved
circle
for
whom
the
pleasant
task
was
undertaken
have
pronounced
the
result
to
be
eminently
successful
and
they
generously
wish
that
the
whole
of
the
juvenile
public
of
england
should
share
in
their
satisfaction
and
possess
complete
swiss
introduction
it
is
very
well
known
that
some
years
ago
counsellor
horner
a
swiss
made
a
voyage
round
the
world
in
the
russian
vessel
commanded
by
capt
krusenstern
they
discovered
many
islands
and
amongst
others
one
very
large
and
fertile
till
then
unknown
to
navigators
to
the
of
java
near
the
coast
of
new
guinea
they
landed
here
and
to
the
great
surprise
of
horner
he
was
received
by
a
family
who
spoke
to
him
in
german
they
were
a
father
and
mother
and
four
robust
and
hardy
sons
their
history
was
very
interesting
the
father
was
a
swiss
clergyman
who
in
the
revolution
of
had
lost
all
his
fortune
and
had
determined
to
emigrate
in
order
to
seek
elsewhere
the
means
of
supporting
his
family
he
went
first
to
england
with
his
wife
and
children
consisting
of
four
sons
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
five
he
there
undertook
the
office
of
missionary
to
otaheite
not
that
he
intended
to
remain
on
that
uncivilized
island
but
he
wished
to
proceed
from
thence
to
port
jackson
as
a
free
colonist
he
invested
his
little
capital
in
seeds
of
every
description
and
some
cattle
to
take
out
with
him
they
had
a
prosperous
voyage
till
they
were
near
the
coast
of
new
guinea
when
they
were
overtaken
by
a
frightful
storm
at
this
period
he
commenced
his
journal
which
he
afterwards
committed
to
the
care
of
horner
to
be
forwarded
to
his
friends
in
switzerland
some
time
before
a
boat
from
an
english
vessel
the
had
visited
them
and
the
father
had
sent
the
first
part
of
his
journal
by
lieut
bell
to
the
captain
who
remained
in
the
vessel
a
violent
tempest
arose
which
continued
some
days
and
drove
the
from
the
coast
the
family
concluded
the
ship
was
lost
but
this
was
not
the
case
as
will
be
seen
in
the
conclusion
chapter
i
the
tempest
had
raged
for
six
days
and
on
the
seventh
seemed
to
increase
the
ship
had
been
so
far
driven
from
its
course
that
no
one
on
board
knew
where
we
were
every
one
was
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
watching
the
shattered
vessel
began
to
leak
in
many
places
the
oaths
of
the
sailors
were
changed
to
prayers
and
each
thought
only
how
to
save
his
own
life
children
said
i
to
my
terrified
boys
who
were
clinging
round
me
god
can
save
us
if
he
will
to
him
nothing
is
impossible
but
if
he
thinks
it
good
to
call
us
to
him
let
us
not
murmur
we
shall
not
be
separated
my
excellent
wife
dried
her
tears
and
from
that
moment
became
more
tranquil
we
knelt
down
to
pray
for
the
help
of
our
heavenly
father
and
the
fervour
and
emotion
of
my
innocent
boys
proved
to
me
that
even
children
can
pray
and
find
in
prayer
consolation
and
peace
we
rose
from
our
knees
strengthened
to
bear
the
afflictions
that
hung
over
us
suddenly
we
heard
amid
the
roaring
of
the
waves
the
cry
of
land
land
at
that
moment
the
ship
struck
on
a
rock
the
concussion
threw
us
down
we
heard
a
loud
cracking
as
if
the
vessel
was
parting
asunder
we
felt
that
we
were
aground
and
heard
the
captain
cry
in
a
tone
of
despair
we
are
lost
launch
the
boats
these
words
were
a
dagger
to
my
heart
and
the
lamentations
of
my
children
were
louder
than
ever
i
then
recollected
myself
and
said
courage
my
darlings
we
are
still
above
water
and
the
land
is
near
god
helps
those
who
trust
in
him
remain
here
and
i
will
endeavour
to
save
us
i
went
on
deck
and
was
instantly
thrown
down
and
wet
through
by
a
huge
sea
a
second
followed
i
struggled
boldly
with
the
waves
and
succeeded
in
keeping
myself
up
when
i
saw
with
terror
the
extent
of
our
wretchedness
the
shattered
vessel
was
almost
in
two
the
crew
had
crowded
into
the
boats
and
the
last
sailor
was
cutting
the
rope
i
cried
out
and
prayed
them
to
take
us
with
them
but
my
voice
was
drowned
in
the
roar
of
the
tempest
nor
could
they
have
returned
for
us
through
waves
that
ran
mountains
high
all
hope
from
their
assistance
was
lost
but
i
was
consoled
by
observing
that
the
water
did
not
enter
the
ship
above
a
certain
height
the
stern
under
which
lay
the
cabin
which
contained
all
that
was
dear
to
me
on
earth
was
immovably
fixed
between
two
rocks
at
the
same
time
i
observed
towards
the
south
traces
of
land
which
though
wild
and
barren
was
now
the
haven
of
my
almost
expiring
hopes
no
longer
being
able
to
depend
on
any
human
aid
i
returned
to
my
family
and
endeavoured
to
appear
calm
take
courage
cried
i
there
is
yet
hope
for
us
the
vessel
in
striking
between
the
rocks
is
fixed
in
a
position
which
protects
our
cabin
above
the
water
and
if
the
wind
should
settle
we
may
possibly
reach
the
land
this
assurance
calmed
my
children
and
as
usual
they
depended
on
all
i
told
them
they
rejoiced
that
the
heaving
of
the
vessel
had
ceased
as
while
it
lasted
they
were
continually
thrown
against
each
other
my
wife
more
accustomed
to
read
my
countenance
discovered
my
uneasiness
and
by
a
sign
i
explained
to
her
that
i
had
lost
all
hope
i
felt
great
consolation
in
seeing
that
she
supported
our
misfortune
with
truly
christian
resignation
let
us
take
some
food
said
she
with
the
body
the
mind
is
strengthened
this
must
be
a
night
of
trial
night
came
and
the
tempest
continued
its
fury
tearing
away
the
planks
from
the
devoted
vessel
with
a
fearful
crashing
it
appeared
absolutely
impossible
that
the
boats
could
have
the
storm
my
wife
had
prepared
some
refreshment
of
which
the
children
partook
with
an
appetite
that
we
could
not
feel
the
three
younger
ones
retired
to
their
beds
and
soon
slept
soundly
fritz
the
eldest
watched
with
me
i
have
been
considering
said
he
how
we
could
save
ourselves
if
we
only
had
some
cork
jackets
or
bladders
for
mamma
and
my
brothers
you
and
i
do
need
them
we
could
then
swim
to
land
a
good
thought
said
i
i
will
try
during
the
night
to
contrive
some
expedient
to
secure
our
safety
we
found
some
small
empty
barrels
in
the
cabin
which
we
tied
two
together
with
our
handkerchiefs
leaving
a
space
between
for
each
child
and
fastened
this
new
swimming
apparatus
under
their
arms
my
wife
prepared
the
same
for
herself
we
then
collected
some
knives
string
and
such
little
necessaries
as
we
could
put
in
our
pockets
thus
in
case
the
vessel
should
fall
to
pieces
during
the
night
we
hoped
we
might
be
enabled
to
reach
land
at
length
fritz
overcome
with
fatigue
lay
down
and
slept
with
his
brothers
my
wife
and
i
too
anxious
to
rest
spent
that
dreadful
night
in
prayer
and
in
arranging
various
plans
how
gladly
we
welcomed
the
light
of
day
shining
through
an
opening
the
wind
was
subsiding
the
sky
serene
and
i
watched
the
sun
rise
with
renewed
hope
i
called
my
wife
and
children
on
deck
the
younger
ones
were
surprised
to
find
we
were
alone
they
inquired
what
had
become
of
the
sailors
and
how
we
should
manage
the
ship
alone
children
said
i
one
more
powerful
than
man
has
protected
us
till
now
and
will
still
extend
a
saving
arm
to
us
if
we
do
not
give
way
to
complaint
and
despair
let
all
hands
set
to
work
remember
that
excellent
maxim
god
helps
those
who
help
themselves
let
us
all
consider
what
is
best
to
do
now
let
us
leap
into
the
sea
cried
fritz
and
swim
to
the
shore
very
well
for
you
replied
ernest
who
can
swim
but
we
should
be
all
drowned
would
it
not
be
better
to
construct
a
raft
and
go
all
together
that
might
do
added
i
if
we
were
strong
enough
for
such
a
work
and
if
a
raft
was
not
always
so
dangerous
a
conveyance
but
away
boys
look
about
you
and
seek
for
anything
that
may
be
useful
to
us
we
all
dispersed
to
different
parts
of
the
vessel
for
my
own
part
i
went
to
the
to
look
after
the
casks
of
water
and
other
necessaries
of
life
my
wife
visited
the
live
stock
and
fed
them
for
they
were
almost
famished
fritz
sought
for
arms
and
ammunition
ernest
for
the
carpenter
tools
jack
had
opened
the
captain
cabin
and
was
immediately
thrown
down
by
two
large
dogs
who
leaped
on
him
so
roughly
that
he
cried
out
as
if
they
were
going
to
devour
him
however
hunger
had
rendered
them
so
docile
that
they
licked
his
hands
and
he
soon
recovered
his
feet
seized
the
largest
by
the
ears
and
mounting
his
back
gravely
rode
up
to
me
as
i
was
coming
from
the
hold
i
could
not
help
laughing
i
applauded
his
courage
but
recommended
him
always
to
be
prudent
with
animals
of
that
kind
who
are
often
dangerous
when
hungry
my
little
troop
began
to
assemble
fritz
had
found
two
some
bags
of
powder
and
shot
and
some
balls
in
horn
flasks
ernest
was
loaded
with
an
axe
and
hammer
a
pair
of
pincers
a
large
pair
of
scissors
and
an
auger
showed
itself
half
out
of
his
pocket
francis
had
a
large
box
under
his
arm
from
which
he
eagerly
produced
what
he
called
little
pointed
hooks
his
brothers
laughed
at
his
prize
silence
said
i
the
youngest
has
made
the
most
valuable
addition
to
our
stores
these
are
and
may
be
more
useful
for
the
preservation
of
our
lives
than
anything
the
ship
contains
however
fritz
and
ernest
have
not
done
amiss
for
my
part
said
my
wife
i
only
contribute
good
news
i
have
found
a
cow
an
ass
two
goats
six
sheep
and
a
sow
with
young
i
have
fed
them
and
hope
we
may
preserve
them
very
well
said
i
to
my
little
workmen
i
am
satisfied
with
all
but
master
jack
who
instead
of
anything
useful
has
contributed
two
great
eaters
who
will
do
us
more
harm
than
good
they
can
help
us
to
hunt
when
we
get
to
land
said
jack
yes
replied
i
but
can
you
devise
any
means
of
our
getting
there
it
does
not
seem
at
all
difficult
said
the
spirited
little
fellow
put
us
each
into
a
great
tub
and
let
us
float
to
shore
i
remember
sailing
capitally
that
way
on
godpapa
great
pond
at
s
a
very
good
idea
jack
good
counsel
may
sometimes
be
given
even
by
a
child
be
quick
boys
give
me
the
saw
and
auger
with
some
nails
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
i
remembered
seeing
some
empty
casks
in
the
hold
we
went
down
and
found
them
floating
this
gave
us
less
difficulty
in
getting
them
upon
the
lower
deck
which
was
but
just
above
the
water
they
were
of
strong
wood
bound
with
iron
hoops
and
exactly
suited
my
purpose
my
sons
and
i
therefore
began
to
saw
them
through
the
middle
after
long
labour
we
had
eight
tubs
all
the
same
height
we
refreshed
ourselves
with
wine
and
biscuit
which
we
had
found
in
some
of
the
casks
i
then
contemplated
with
delight
my
little
squadron
of
boats
ranged
in
a
line
and
was
surprised
that
my
wife
still
continued
depressed
she
looked
mournfully
on
them
i
can
never
venture
in
one
of
these
tubs
said
she
wait
a
little
till
my
work
is
finished
replied
i
and
you
will
see
it
is
more
to
be
depended
on
than
this
broken
vessel
i
sought
out
a
long
flexible
plank
and
arranged
eight
tubs
on
it
close
to
each
other
leaving
a
piece
at
each
end
to
form
a
curve
upwards
like
the
keel
of
a
vessel
we
then
nailed
them
firmly
to
the
plank
and
to
each
other
we
nailed
a
plank
at
each
side
of
the
same
length
as
the
first
and
succeeded
in
producing
a
sort
of
boat
divided
into
eight
compartments
in
which
it
did
not
appear
difficult
to
make
a
short
voyage
over
a
calm
sea
but
unluckily
our
wonderful
vessel
proved
so
heavy
that
our
united
efforts
could
not
move
it
an
inch
i
sent
fritz
to
bring
me
the
and
in
the
mean
time
sawed
a
thick
round
pole
into
pieces
then
raising
the
of
our
work
by
means
of
the
powerful
machine
fritz
placed
one
of
these
rollers
under
it
ernest
was
very
anxious
to
know
how
this
small
machine
could
accomplish
more
than
our
united
strength
i
explained
to
him
as
well
as
i
could
the
power
of
the
lever
of
archimedes
with
which
he
had
declared
he
could
move
the
world
if
he
had
but
a
point
to
rest
it
on
and
i
promised
my
son
to
take
the
machine
to
pieces
when
we
were
on
shore
and
explain
the
mode
of
operation
i
then
told
them
that
god
to
compensate
for
the
weakness
of
man
had
bestowed
on
him
reason
invention
and
skill
in
workmanship
the
result
of
these
had
produced
a
science
which
under
the
name
of
taught
us
to
increase
and
extend
our
limited
powers
incredibly
by
the
aid
of
instruments
jack
remarked
that
the
worked
very
slowly
better
slowly
than
not
at
all
said
i
it
is
a
principle
in
mechanics
that
what
is
gained
in
time
is
lost
in
power
the
jack
is
not
meant
to
work
rapidly
but
to
raise
heavy
weights
and
the
heavier
the
weight
the
slower
the
operation
but
can
you
tell
me
how
we
can
make
up
for
this
slowness
oh
by
turning
the
handle
quicker
to
be
sure
quite
wrong
that
would
not
aid
us
at
all
patience
and
reason
are
the
two
fairies
by
whose
potent
help
i
hope
to
get
our
boat
afloat
i
quickly
proceeded
to
tie
a
strong
cord
to
the
of
it
and
the
other
end
to
a
beam
in
the
ship
which
was
still
firm
leaving
it
long
enough
for
security
then
introducing
two
more
rollers
underneath
and
working
with
the
jack
we
succeeded
in
launching
our
bark
which
passed
into
the
water
with
such
velocity
that
but
for
our
rope
it
would
have
gone
out
to
sea
unfortunately
it
leaned
so
much
on
one
side
that
none
of
the
boys
would
venture
into
it
i
was
in
despair
when
i
suddenly
remembered
it
only
wanted
ballast
to
keep
it
in
equilibrium
i
hastily
threw
in
anything
i
got
hold
of
that
was
heavy
and
soon
had
my
boat
level
and
ready
for
occupation
they
now
contended
who
should
enter
first
but
i
stopped
them
reflecting
that
these
restless
children
might
easily
capsize
our
vessel
i
remembered
that
savage
nations
made
use
of
an
to
prevent
their
canoe
oversetting
and
this
i
determined
to
add
to
my
work
i
fixed
two
portions
of
a
one
over
the
prow
the
other
across
the
stern
in
such
a
manner
that
they
should
not
be
in
the
way
in
pushing
off
our
boat
from
the
wreck
i
forced
the
end
of
each
yard
into
the
bunghole
of
an
empty
to
keep
them
steady
during
our
progress
it
was
now
necessary
to
clear
the
way
for
our
departure
i
got
into
the
first
tub
and
managed
to
get
the
boat
into
the
cleft
in
the
side
by
way
of
a
haven
i
then
returned
and
with
the
axe
and
saw
cut
away
right
and
left
all
that
could
obstruct
our
passage
then
we
secured
some
oars
to
be
ready
for
our
voyage
next
day
the
day
had
passed
in
toil
and
we
were
compelled
to
spend
another
night
on
the
wreck
though
we
knew
it
might
not
remain
till
morning
we
took
a
regular
meal
for
during
the
day
we
had
scarcely
had
time
to
snatch
a
morsel
of
bread
and
a
glass
of
wine
more
composed
than
on
the
preceding
night
we
retired
to
rest
i
took
the
precaution
to
fasten
the
swimming
apparatus
across
the
shoulders
of
my
three
younger
children
and
my
wife
for
fear
another
storm
might
destroy
the
vessel
and
cast
us
into
the
sea
i
also
advised
my
wife
to
put
on
a
sailor
dress
as
more
convenient
for
her
expected
toils
and
trials
she
reluctantly
consented
and
after
a
short
absence
appeared
in
the
dress
of
a
youth
who
had
served
as
a
volunteer
in
the
vessel
she
felt
very
timid
and
awkward
in
her
new
dress
but
i
showed
her
the
advantage
of
the
change
and
at
last
she
was
reconciled
and
joined
in
the
laughter
of
the
children
at
her
strange
disguise
she
then
got
into
her
hammock
and
we
enjoyed
a
pleasant
sleep
to
prepare
us
for
new
labours
chapter
ii
at
break
of
day
we
were
awake
and
ready
and
after
morning
prayer
i
addressed
my
children
thus
we
are
now
my
dear
boys
with
the
help
of
god
about
to
attempt
our
deliverance
before
we
go
provide
our
poor
animals
with
food
for
some
days
we
can
not
take
them
with
us
but
if
our
voyage
succeed
we
may
return
for
them
are
you
ready
collect
what
you
wish
to
carry
away
but
only
things
absolutely
necessary
for
our
actual
wants
i
planned
that
our
first
cargo
should
consist
of
a
barrel
of
powder
three
three
muskets
two
pair
of
pocket
pistols
and
one
pair
larger
ball
shot
and
lead
as
much
as
we
could
carry
with
a
and
i
wished
each
of
my
sons
as
well
as
their
mother
should
have
a
complete
of
which
there
were
several
in
the
officers
cabins
we
then
set
apart
a
box
of
portable
soup
another
of
biscuit
an
iron
pot
a
a
chest
of
nails
and
one
of
carpenter
tools
also
some
sailcloth
to
make
a
tent
in
fact
my
boys
collected
so
many
things
we
were
compelled
to
leave
some
behind
though
i
exchanged
all
the
useless
ballast
for
necessaries
when
all
was
ready
we
implored
the
blessing
of
god
on
our
undertaking
and
prepared
to
embark
in
our
tubs
at
this
moment
the
cocks
crowed
a
sort
of
reproachful
farewell
to
us
we
had
forgotten
them
i
immediately
proposed
to
take
our
poultry
with
us
geese
ducks
fowls
and
pigeons
for
as
i
observed
to
my
wife
if
we
could
not
feed
them
they
would
at
any
rate
feed
us
we
placed
our
ten
hens
and
two
cocks
in
a
covered
tub
the
rest
we
set
at
liberty
hoping
the
geese
and
ducks
might
reach
the
shore
by
water
and
the
pigeons
by
flight
we
waited
a
little
for
my
wife
who
came
loaded
with
a
large
bag
which
she
threw
into
the
tub
that
contained
her
youngest
son
i
concluded
it
was
intended
to
steady
him
or
for
a
seat
and
made
no
observation
on
it
here
follows
the
order
of
our
embarkation
in
the
first
division
sat
the
tender
mother
the
faithful
and
pious
wife
in
the
second
our
amiable
little
francis
six
years
old
and
of
a
sweet
disposition
in
the
third
fritz
our
eldest
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
a
clever
intelligent
and
lively
youth
in
the
fourth
the
with
the
fowls
and
the
sailcloth
our
provisions
filled
the
fifth
in
the
sixth
our
heedless
jack
ten
years
old
enterprising
bold
and
useful
in
the
seventh
ernest
twelve
years
of
age
and
rational
but
somewhat
selfish
and
indolent
in
the
eighth
myself
an
anxious
father
charged
with
the
important
duty
of
guiding
the
vessel
to
save
my
dear
family
each
of
us
had
some
useful
tools
beside
us
each
held
an
oar
and
had
a
swimming
apparatus
at
hand
in
case
we
were
unfortunately
upset
the
tide
was
rising
when
we
left
which
i
considered
might
assist
my
weak
endeavours
we
turned
our
and
thus
passed
from
the
cleft
of
the
ship
into
the
open
sea
we
rowed
with
all
our
might
to
reach
the
blue
land
we
saw
at
a
distance
but
for
some
time
in
vain
as
the
boat
kept
turning
round
and
made
no
progress
at
last
i
contrived
to
steer
it
so
that
we
went
straight
forward
as
soon
as
our
dogs
saw
us
depart
they
leaped
into
the
sea
and
followed
us
i
could
not
let
them
get
into
the
boat
for
fear
they
should
upset
it
i
was
very
sorry
for
i
hardly
expected
they
would
be
able
to
swim
to
land
but
by
occasionally
resting
their
forepaws
on
our
they
managed
to
keep
up
with
us
turk
was
an
english
dog
and
flora
of
a
danish
breed
we
proceeded
slowly
but
safely
the
nearer
we
approached
the
land
the
more
dreary
and
unpromising
it
appeared
the
rocky
coast
seemed
to
announce
to
us
nothing
but
famine
and
misery
the
waves
gently
rippling
against
the
shore
were
scattered
over
with
barrels
bales
and
chests
from
the
wreck
hoping
to
secure
some
good
provisions
i
called
on
fritz
for
assistance
he
held
a
cord
hammer
and
nails
and
we
managed
to
seize
two
hogsheads
in
passing
and
fastening
them
with
cords
to
our
vessel
drew
them
after
us
to
the
shore
as
we
approached
the
coast
seemed
to
improve
the
chain
of
rock
was
not
entire
and
fritz
hawk
eye
made
out
some
trees
which
he
declared
were
the
tree
ernest
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
eating
these
nuts
so
much
larger
and
better
than
any
grown
in
europe
i
was
regretting
not
having
brought
the
large
telescope
from
the
cabin
when
jack
produced
from
his
pocket
a
smaller
one
which
he
offered
me
with
no
little
pride
this
was
a
valuable
acquisition
as
i
was
now
enabled
to
make
the
requisite
observations
and
direct
my
course
the
coast
before
us
had
a
wild
and
desert
appearance
it
looked
better
towards
the
left
but
i
could
not
approach
that
part
for
a
current
which
drove
us
towards
the
rocky
and
barren
shore
at
length
we
saw
near
the
mouth
of
a
rivulet
a
little
creek
between
the
rocks
towards
which
our
geese
and
ducks
made
serving
us
for
guides
this
opening
formed
a
little
bay
of
smooth
water
just
deep
enough
for
our
boat
i
cautiously
entered
it
and
landed
at
a
place
where
the
coast
was
about
the
height
of
our
tubs
and
the
water
deep
enough
to
let
us
approach
the
shore
spread
inland
forming
a
gentle
declivity
of
a
triangular
form
the
point
lost
among
the
rocks
and
the
base
to
the
sea
all
that
were
able
leaped
on
shore
in
a
moment
even
little
francis
who
had
been
laid
down
in
his
tub
like
a
salted
herring
tried
to
crawl
out
but
was
compelled
to
wait
for
his
mother
assistance
the
dogs
who
had
preceded
us
in
landing
welcomed
us
in
a
truly
friendly
manner
leaping
playfully
around
us
the
geese
kept
up
a
loud
cackling
to
which
the
ducks
quacked
a
powerful
bass
this
with
the
clacking
of
the
liberated
fowls
and
the
chattering
of
the
boys
formed
a
perfect
babel
mingled
with
these
were
the
harsh
cries
of
the
penguins
and
flamingoes
which
hovered
over
our
heads
or
sat
on
the
points
of
the
rocks
they
were
in
immense
numbers
and
their
notes
almost
deafened
us
especially
as
they
did
not
accord
with
the
harmony
of
our
civilized
fowls
however
i
rejoiced
to
see
these
feathered
creatures
already
fancying
them
on
my
table
if
we
were
obliged
to
remain
in
this
desert
region
our
first
care
when
we
stepped
in
safety
on
land
was
to
kneel
down
and
thank
god
to
whom
we
owed
our
lives
and
to
resign
ourselves
wholly
to
his
fatherly
kindness
we
then
began
to
unload
our
vessel
how
rich
we
thought
ourselves
with
the
little
we
had
saved
we
sought
a
convenient
place
for
our
tent
under
the
shade
of
the
rocks
we
then
inserted
a
pole
into
a
fissure
in
the
rock
this
resting
firmly
on
another
pole
fixed
in
the
ground
formed
the
frame
of
the
tent
the
sailcloth
was
then
stretched
over
it
and
fastened
down
at
proper
distances
by
pegs
to
which
for
greater
security
we
added
some
boxes
of
provision
we
fixed
some
hooks
to
the
canvas
at
the
opening
in
front
that
we
might
close
the
entrance
during
the
night
i
sent
my
sons
to
seek
some
moss
and
withered
grass
and
spread
it
in
the
sun
to
dry
to
form
our
beds
and
while
all
even
little
francis
were
busy
with
this
i
constructed
a
sort
of
at
some
distance
from
the
tent
near
the
river
which
was
to
supply
us
with
fresh
water
it
was
merely
a
hearth
of
flat
stones
from
the
bed
of
the
stream
fenced
round
with
some
thick
branches
i
kindled
a
cheerful
fire
with
some
dry
twigs
put
on
the
pot
filled
with
water
and
some
squares
of
portable
soup
and
left
my
wife
with
francis
for
assistant
to
prepare
dinner
he
took
the
portable
soup
for
glue
and
could
not
conceive
how
mamma
could
make
soup
as
we
had
no
meat
and
there
were
no
butchers
shops
here
fritz
in
the
mean
time
had
loaded
our
guns
he
took
one
to
the
side
of
the
river
ernest
declined
accompanying
him
as
the
rugged
road
was
not
to
his
taste
he
preferred
the
jack
proceeded
to
a
ridge
of
rocks
on
the
left
which
ran
towards
the
sea
to
get
some
muscles
i
went
to
try
and
draw
the
two
floating
hogsheads
on
shore
but
could
not
succeed
for
our
was
too
steep
to
get
them
up
whilst
i
was
vainly
trying
to
find
a
more
favourable
place
i
heard
my
dear
jack
uttering
most
alarming
cries
i
seized
my
hatchet
and
ran
to
his
assistance
i
found
him
up
to
the
knees
in
a
shallow
pool
with
a
large
lobster
holding
his
leg
in
its
sharp
claws
it
made
off
at
my
approach
but
i
was
determined
it
should
pay
for
the
fright
it
had
given
me
cautiously
taking
it
up
i
brought
it
out
followed
by
jack
who
now
very
triumphant
wished
to
present
it
himself
to
his
mother
after
watching
how
i
held
it
but
he
had
hardly
got
it
into
his
hands
when
it
gave
him
such
a
violent
blow
on
the
cheek
with
its
tail
that
he
let
it
fall
and
began
to
cry
again
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
him
and
in
his
rage
he
seized
a
stone
and
put
an
end
to
his
adversary
i
was
grieved
at
this
and
recommended
him
never
to
act
in
a
moment
of
anger
showing
him
that
he
was
unjust
in
being
so
revengeful
for
if
he
had
been
bitten
by
the
lobster
it
was
plain
he
would
have
eaten
his
foe
if
he
had
conquered
him
jack
promised
to
be
more
discreet
and
merciful
in
future
and
obtained
leave
to
bear
the
prize
to
his
mother
mamma
said
he
proudly
a
lobster
a
lobster
ernest
where
is
fritz
take
care
it
does
not
bite
you
francis
they
all
crowded
round
in
astonishment
yes
added
he
triumphantly
here
is
the
impertinent
claw
that
seized
me
but
i
repaid
the
knave
you
are
a
boaster
said
i
you
would
have
got
indifferently
on
with
the
lobster
if
i
had
not
come
up
and
have
you
forgotten
the
slap
on
the
cheek
which
compelled
you
to
release
him
besides
he
only
defended
himself
with
his
natural
arms
but
you
had
to
take
a
great
stone
you
have
no
reason
to
be
proud
jack
ernest
wished
to
have
the
lobster
added
to
the
soup
to
improve
it
but
his
mother
with
a
spirit
of
economy
reserved
it
for
another
day
i
then
walked
to
the
spot
where
jack
lobster
was
caught
and
finding
it
favourable
for
my
purpose
drew
my
two
hogsheads
on
shore
there
and
secured
them
by
turning
them
on
end
on
returning
i
congratulated
jack
on
being
the
first
who
had
been
successful
in
foraging
ernest
remarked
that
he
had
seen
some
oysters
attached
to
a
rock
but
could
not
get
at
them
without
wetting
his
feet
which
he
did
not
like
indeed
my
delicate
gentleman
said
i
laughing
i
must
trouble
you
to
return
and
procure
us
some
we
must
all
unite
in
working
for
the
public
good
regardless
of
wet
feet
the
sun
will
soon
dry
us
i
might
as
well
bring
some
salt
at
the
same
time
said
he
i
saw
plenty
in
the
fissures
of
the
rock
left
by
the
sea
i
should
think
papa
doubtless
reasoner
replied
i
where
else
could
it
have
come
from
the
fact
was
so
obvious
that
you
had
better
have
brought
a
bagful
than
delayed
to
reflect
about
it
but
if
you
wish
to
escape
insipid
soup
be
quick
and
procure
some
he
went
and
returned
with
some
salt
so
mixed
with
sand
and
earth
that
i
should
have
thrown
it
away
as
useless
but
my
wife
dissolved
it
in
fresh
water
and
filtering
it
through
a
piece
of
canvas
managed
to
flavour
our
soup
with
it
jack
asked
why
we
could
not
have
used
and
i
explained
to
him
that
the
bitter
and
nauseous
taste
of
would
have
spoiled
our
dinner
my
wife
stirred
the
soup
with
a
little
stick
and
tasting
it
pronounced
it
very
good
but
added
we
must
wait
for
fritz
and
how
shall
we
eat
our
soup
without
plates
or
spoons
we
can
not
possibly
raise
this
large
boiling
pot
to
our
heads
and
drink
out
of
it
it
was
too
true
we
gazed
stupified
at
our
pot
and
at
last
all
burst
into
laughter
at
our
destitution
and
our
folly
in
forgetting
such
useful
necessaries
if
we
only
had
said
ernest
we
might
split
them
and
make
basins
and
spoons
replied
i
but
we
have
none
we
might
as
well
wish
for
a
dozen
handsome
silver
spoons
at
once
if
wishes
were
of
any
use
but
observed
he
we
can
use
a
useful
thought
ernest
go
directly
and
get
the
oysters
and
remember
gentlemen
no
complaints
though
the
spoons
are
without
handles
and
you
should
dip
your
fingers
into
the
bowl
off
ran
jack
and
was
in
the
water
before
ernest
got
to
him
he
tore
down
the
oysters
and
threw
them
to
his
idle
brother
who
filled
his
handkerchief
taking
care
to
put
a
large
one
into
his
pocket
for
his
own
use
and
they
returned
with
their
spoil
fritz
had
not
yet
appeared
and
his
mother
was
becoming
uneasy
when
we
heard
him
cheerfully
hailing
us
at
a
distance
he
soon
came
up
with
a
feigned
air
of
disappointment
and
his
hands
behind
him
but
jack
who
had
glided
round
him
cried
out
a
sucking
pig
a
sucking
pig
and
he
then
with
great
pride
and
satisfaction
produced
his
booty
which
i
recognized
from
the
description
of
travellers
to
be
the
common
in
these
regions
a
swift
animal
which
burrows
in
the
earth
and
lives
on
fruits
and
nuts
its
flesh
something
like
that
of
the
rabbit
has
an
unpleasant
flavour
to
europeans
all
were
anxious
to
know
the
particulars
of
the
chase
but
i
seriously
reproved
my
son
for
his
little
fiction
and
warned
him
never
to
use
the
least
deceit
even
in
jest
i
then
inquired
where
he
had
met
with
the
agouti
he
told
me
he
had
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
a
very
different
place
to
this
continued
he
the
shore
lies
low
and
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
number
of
casks
chests
planks
and
all
sorts
of
things
the
sea
has
thrown
up
shall
we
go
and
take
possession
of
them
and
father
we
ought
to
make
another
trip
to
the
vessel
to
look
after
our
cattle
we
might
at
least
bring
away
the
cow
our
biscuit
would
not
be
so
hard
dipped
in
milk
and
very
much
nicer
added
the
greedy
ernest
then
continued
fritz
beyond
the
river
there
is
rich
grass
for
pasturage
and
a
shady
wood
why
should
we
remain
in
this
barren
wilderness
softly
replied
i
there
is
a
time
for
all
things
and
the
day
after
will
have
their
work
but
first
tell
me
did
you
see
anything
of
our
shipmates
not
a
trace
of
man
living
or
dead
on
land
or
sea
but
i
saw
an
animal
more
like
a
hog
than
this
but
with
feet
like
a
hare
it
leaped
among
the
grass
sometimes
sitting
upright
and
rubbing
its
mouth
with
its
forepaws
sometimes
seeking
for
roots
and
gnawing
them
like
a
squirrel
if
i
had
not
been
afraid
it
would
escape
me
i
would
have
tried
to
take
it
alive
it
seemed
so
very
tame
as
we
were
talking
jack
had
been
trying
with
many
grimaces
to
force
an
oyster
open
with
his
knife
i
laughed
at
his
vain
endeavours
and
putting
some
on
the
fire
showed
him
them
open
of
themselves
i
had
no
taste
for
oysters
myself
but
as
they
are
everywhere
accounted
a
delicacy
i
advised
my
sons
to
try
them
they
all
at
first
declined
the
unattractive
repast
except
jack
who
with
great
courage
closed
his
eyes
and
desperately
swallowed
one
as
if
it
had
been
medicine
the
rest
followed
his
example
and
then
all
agreed
with
me
that
oysters
were
not
good
the
shells
were
soon
plunged
into
the
pot
to
bring
out
some
of
the
good
soup
but
scalding
their
fingers
it
was
who
could
cry
out
the
loudest
ernest
took
his
large
shell
from
his
pocket
cautiously
filled
it
with
a
good
portion
of
soup
and
set
it
down
to
cool
exulting
in
his
own
prudence
you
have
been
very
thoughtful
my
dear
ernest
said
i
but
why
are
your
thoughts
always
for
yourself
so
seldom
for
others
as
a
punishment
for
your
egotism
that
portion
must
be
given
to
our
faithful
dogs
we
can
all
dip
our
shells
into
the
pot
the
dogs
can
not
therefore
they
shall
have
your
soup
and
you
must
wait
and
eat
as
we
do
my
reproach
struck
his
heart
and
he
placed
his
shell
obediently
on
the
ground
which
the
dogs
emptied
immediately
we
were
almost
as
hungry
as
they
were
and
were
watching
anxiously
till
the
soup
began
to
cool
when
we
perceived
that
the
dogs
were
tearing
and
gnawing
agouti
the
boys
all
cried
out
fritz
was
in
a
fury
took
his
gun
struck
the
dogs
called
them
names
threw
stones
at
them
and
would
have
killed
them
if
i
had
not
held
him
he
had
actually
bent
his
gun
with
striking
them
as
soon
as
he
would
listen
to
me
i
reproached
him
seriously
for
his
violence
and
represented
to
him
how
much
he
had
distressed
us
and
terrified
his
mother
that
he
had
spoiled
his
gun
which
might
have
been
so
useful
to
us
and
had
almost
killed
the
poor
animals
who
might
be
more
so
anger
said
i
leads
to
every
crime
remember
cain
who
killed
his
brother
in
a
fit
of
passion
oh
father
said
he
in
a
voice
of
terror
and
acknowledging
his
error
he
asked
pardon
and
shed
bitter
tears
soon
after
our
repast
the
sun
set
and
the
fowls
gathered
round
us
and
picked
up
the
scattered
crumbs
of
biscuit
my
wife
then
took
out
her
mysterious
bag
and
drew
from
it
some
handfuls
of
grain
to
feed
her
flock
she
showed
me
also
many
other
seeds
of
useful
vegetables
i
praised
her
prudence
and
begged
her
to
be
very
economical
as
these
seeds
were
of
great
value
and
we
could
bring
from
the
vessel
some
spoiled
biscuit
for
the
fowls
our
pigeons
now
flew
among
the
rocks
the
cocks
and
hens
perched
on
the
frame
of
the
tent
and
the
geese
and
ducks
chose
to
roost
in
a
marsh
covered
with
bushes
near
the
sea
we
prepared
for
our
rest
we
loaded
all
our
arms
then
offered
up
our
prayers
together
thanking
god
for
his
signal
mercy
to
us
and
commending
ourselves
to
his
care
when
the
last
ray
of
light
departed
we
closed
our
tent
and
lay
down
on
our
beds
close
together
the
children
had
remarked
how
suddenly
the
darkness
came
on
from
which
i
concluded
we
were
not
far
from
the
equator
for
i
explained
to
them
the
more
perpendicularly
the
rays
of
the
sun
fall
the
less
their
refraction
and
consequently
night
comes
on
suddenly
when
the
sun
is
below
the
horizon
once
more
i
looked
out
to
see
if
all
was
quiet
then
carefully
closing
the
entrance
i
lay
down
warm
as
the
day
had
been
the
night
was
so
cold
that
we
were
obliged
to
crowd
together
for
warmth
the
children
soon
slept
and
when
i
saw
their
mother
in
her
first
peaceful
sleep
my
own
eyes
closed
and
our
first
night
on
the
island
passed
comfortably
chapter
iii
at
break
of
day
i
was
waked
by
the
crowing
of
the
cock
i
summoned
my
wife
to
council
to
consider
on
the
business
of
the
day
we
agreed
that
our
first
duty
was
to
seek
for
our
shipmates
and
to
examine
the
country
beyond
the
river
before
we
came
to
any
decisive
resolution
my
wife
saw
we
could
not
all
go
on
this
expedition
and
courageously
agreed
to
remain
with
her
three
youngest
sons
while
fritz
as
the
eldest
and
boldest
should
accompany
me
i
begged
her
to
prepare
breakfast
immediately
which
she
warned
me
would
be
scanty
as
no
soup
was
provided
i
asked
for
jack
lobster
but
it
was
not
to
be
found
whilst
my
wife
made
the
fire
and
put
on
the
pot
i
called
the
children
and
asking
jack
for
the
lobster
he
brought
it
from
a
crevice
in
the
rock
where
he
had
hidden
it
from
the
dogs
he
said
who
did
not
despise
anything
eatable
i
am
glad
to
see
you
profit
by
the
misfortunes
of
others
said
i
and
now
will
you
give
up
that
large
claw
that
caught
your
leg
and
which
i
promised
you
to
fritz
as
a
provision
for
his
journey
all
were
anxious
to
go
on
this
journey
and
leaped
round
me
like
little
kids
but
i
told
them
we
could
not
all
go
they
must
remain
with
their
mother
with
flora
for
a
protector
fritz
and
i
would
take
turk
with
him
and
a
loaded
gun
i
thought
we
should
inspire
respect
i
then
ordered
fritz
to
tie
up
flora
and
get
the
guns
ready
fritz
blushed
and
tried
in
vain
to
straighten
his
crooked
gun
i
let
him
go
on
for
some
time
and
then
allowed
him
to
take
another
for
i
saw
he
was
penitent
the
dogs
too
snarled
and
would
not
let
him
approach
them
he
wept
and
begged
some
biscuit
from
his
mother
declaring
he
would
give
up
his
own
breakfast
to
make
his
peace
with
the
dogs
he
fed
them
caressed
them
and
seemed
to
ask
pardon
the
dog
is
always
grateful
flora
soon
licked
his
hands
turk
was
more
unrelenting
appearing
to
distrust
him
give
him
a
claw
of
the
lobster
said
jack
for
i
make
you
a
present
of
the
whole
for
your
journey
do
be
uneasy
about
them
said
ernest
they
will
certainly
meet
with
as
robinson
did
very
different
food
to
your
wretched
lobster
think
of
an
almond
as
big
as
my
head
with
a
large
cup
full
of
rich
milk
pray
brother
bring
me
one
if
you
find
any
said
francis
we
began
our
preparation
we
each
took
a
and
a
hatchet
i
gave
fritz
a
pair
of
pistols
in
addition
to
his
gun
equipped
myself
in
the
same
way
and
took
care
to
carry
biscuit
and
a
flask
of
fresh
water
the
lobster
proved
so
hard
at
breakfast
that
the
boys
did
not
object
to
our
carrying
off
the
remainder
and
though
the
flesh
is
coarse
it
is
very
nutritious
i
proposed
before
we
departed
to
have
prayers
and
my
thoughtless
jack
began
to
imitate
the
sound
of
ding
dong
to
prayers
to
prayers
ding
dong
i
was
really
angry
and
reproved
him
severely
for
jesting
about
sacred
things
then
kneeling
down
i
prayed
blessing
on
our
undertaking
and
his
pardon
for
us
all
especially
for
him
who
had
now
so
grievously
sinned
poor
jack
came
and
kneeled
by
me
weeping
and
begging
for
forgiveness
from
me
and
from
god
i
embraced
him
and
enjoined
him
and
his
brothers
to
obey
their
mother
i
then
loaded
the
guns
i
left
with
them
and
charged
my
wife
to
keep
near
the
boat
their
best
refuge
we
took
leave
of
our
friends
with
many
tears
as
we
did
not
know
what
dangers
might
assail
us
in
an
unknown
region
but
the
murmur
of
the
river
which
we
were
now
approaching
drowned
the
sound
of
their
sobs
and
we
bent
our
thoughts
on
our
journey
the
bank
of
the
river
was
so
steep
that
we
could
only
reach
the
bed
at
one
little
opening
near
the
sea
where
we
had
procured
our
water
but
here
the
opposite
side
was
guarded
by
a
ridge
of
lofty
perpendicular
rocks
we
were
obliged
to
ascend
the
river
to
a
place
where
it
fell
over
some
rocks
some
fragments
of
which
having
fallen
made
a
sort
of
which
enabled
us
to
cross
with
some
hazard
we
made
our
way
with
difficulty
through
the
high
grass
withered
by
the
sun
directing
our
course
towards
the
sea
in
hopes
of
discovering
some
traces
of
the
boats
or
the
crew
we
had
scarcely
gone
a
hundred
yards
when
we
heard
a
loud
noise
and
rustling
in
the
grass
which
was
as
tall
as
we
were
we
imagined
we
were
pursued
by
some
wild
beast
and
i
was
gratified
to
observe
the
courage
of
fritz
who
instead
of
running
away
calmly
turned
round
and
presented
his
piece
what
was
our
joy
when
we
discovered
that
the
formidable
enemy
was
only
our
faithful
turk
whom
we
had
forgotten
in
our
distress
and
our
friends
had
doubtless
dispatched
him
after
us
i
applauded
my
son
presence
of
mind
a
rash
act
might
have
deprived
us
of
this
valuable
friend
we
continued
our
way
the
sea
lay
to
our
left
on
our
right
at
a
short
distance
ran
the
chain
of
rocks
which
were
continued
from
our
in
a
line
parallel
to
the
sea
the
summits
clothed
with
verdure
and
various
trees
between
the
rocks
and
the
sea
several
little
woods
extended
even
to
the
shore
to
which
we
kept
as
close
as
possible
vainly
looking
out
on
land
or
sea
for
any
trace
of
our
crew
fritz
proposed
to
fire
his
gun
as
a
signal
to
them
if
they
should
be
near
us
but
i
reminded
him
that
this
signal
might
bring
the
ravages
round
us
instead
of
our
friends
illustration
we
rested
in
the
shade
near
a
clear
stream
and
took
some
refreshment
he
then
inquired
why
we
should
search
after
those
persons
at
all
who
so
unfeelingly
abandoned
us
on
the
wreck
first
said
i
we
must
not
return
evil
for
evil
besides
they
may
assist
us
or
be
in
need
of
our
assistance
above
all
remember
they
could
save
nothing
but
themselves
we
have
got
many
useful
things
which
they
have
as
much
right
to
as
we
but
we
might
be
saving
the
lives
of
our
cattle
said
he
we
should
do
our
duty
better
by
saving
the
life
of
a
man
answered
i
besides
our
cattle
have
food
for
some
days
and
the
sea
is
so
calm
there
is
no
immediate
danger
we
proceeded
and
entering
a
little
wood
that
extended
to
the
sea
we
rested
in
the
shade
near
a
clear
stream
and
took
some
refreshment
we
were
surrounded
by
unknown
birds
more
remarkable
for
brilliant
plumage
than
for
the
charm
of
their
voice
fritz
thought
he
saw
some
monkeys
among
the
leaves
and
turk
began
to
be
restless
smelling
about
and
barking
very
loud
fritz
was
gazing
up
into
the
trees
when
he
fell
over
a
large
round
substance
which
he
brought
to
me
observing
that
it
might
be
a
bird
nest
i
thought
it
more
likely
to
be
a
the
fibrous
covering
had
reminded
him
of
the
description
he
had
read
of
the
nests
of
certain
birds
but
on
breaking
the
shell
we
found
it
was
indeed
a
but
quite
decayed
and
uneatable
fritz
was
astonished
where
was
the
sweet
milk
that
ernest
had
talked
of
i
told
him
the
milk
was
only
in
the
nuts
that
it
thickened
and
hardened
as
the
nut
ripened
becoming
a
kernel
this
nut
had
perished
from
remaining
above
ground
if
it
had
been
in
the
earth
it
would
have
vegetated
and
burst
the
shell
i
advised
my
son
to
try
if
he
could
not
find
a
perfect
nut
after
some
search
we
found
one
and
sat
down
to
eat
it
keeping
our
own
provision
for
dinner
the
nut
was
somewhat
rancid
but
we
enjoyed
it
and
then
continued
our
journey
we
were
some
time
before
we
got
through
the
wood
being
frequently
obliged
to
clear
a
road
for
ourselves
through
the
entangled
brushwood
with
our
hatchets
at
last
we
entered
the
open
plain
again
and
had
a
clear
view
before
us
the
forest
still
extended
about
a
stone
throw
to
our
right
and
fritz
who
was
always
on
the
for
discoveries
observed
a
remarkable
tree
here
and
there
which
he
approached
to
examine
and
he
soon
called
me
to
see
this
wonderful
tree
with
wens
growing
on
the
trunk
on
coming
up
i
was
overjoyed
to
find
this
tree
of
which
there
were
a
great
number
was
the
which
bears
fruit
on
the
trunk
fritz
asked
if
these
were
sponges
i
told
him
to
bring
me
one
and
i
would
explain
the
mystery
there
is
one
said
he
very
like
a
pumpkin
only
harder
outside
of
this
shell
said
i
we
can
make
plates
dishes
basins
and
flasks
we
call
it
the
fritz
leaped
for
joy
now
my
dear
mother
will
be
able
to
serve
her
soup
properly
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
why
the
tree
bore
the
fruit
on
its
trunk
or
on
the
thick
branches
only
he
immediately
replied
that
the
smaller
branches
would
not
bear
the
weight
of
the
fruit
he
asked
me
if
this
fruit
was
eatable
harmless
i
believe
said
i
but
by
no
means
delicate
its
great
value
to
savage
nations
consists
in
the
shell
which
they
use
to
contain
their
food
and
drink
and
even
cook
in
it
fritz
could
not
comprehend
how
they
could
cook
in
the
shell
without
burning
it
i
told
him
the
shell
was
not
placed
on
the
fire
but
being
filled
with
cold
water
and
the
fish
or
meat
placed
in
it
stones
are
by
degrees
introduced
into
the
water
till
it
attains
sufficient
heat
to
cook
the
food
without
injuring
the
vessel
we
then
set
about
making
our
dishes
and
plates
i
showed
fritz
a
better
plan
of
dividing
the
gourd
than
with
a
knife
i
tied
a
string
tightly
round
the
nut
struck
it
with
the
handle
of
my
knife
till
an
incision
was
made
then
tightened
it
till
the
nut
was
separated
into
two
bowls
fritz
had
spoiled
his
gourd
by
cutting
it
irregularly
with
his
knife
i
advised
him
to
try
and
make
spoons
of
it
as
it
would
not
do
for
basins
now
i
told
him
i
had
learnt
my
plan
from
books
of
travels
it
is
the
practice
of
the
savages
who
have
no
knives
to
use
a
sort
of
string
made
from
the
bark
of
trees
for
this
purpose
but
how
can
they
make
bottles
said
he
that
requires
some
preparation
replied
i
they
tie
a
bandage
round
the
young
gourd
near
the
stalk
so
that
the
part
at
liberty
expands
in
a
round
form
and
the
compressed
part
remains
narrow
they
then
open
the
top
and
extract
the
contents
by
putting
in
pebbles
and
shaking
it
by
this
means
they
have
a
complete
bottle
we
worked
on
fritz
completed
a
dish
and
some
plates
to
his
great
satisfaction
but
we
considered
that
being
so
frail
we
could
not
carry
them
with
us
we
therefore
filled
them
with
sand
that
the
sun
might
not
warp
them
and
left
them
to
dry
till
we
returned
as
we
went
on
fritz
amused
himself
with
cutting
spoons
from
the
rind
of
the
gourd
and
i
tried
to
do
the
same
with
the
fragments
of
the
but
i
must
confess
my
performances
were
inferior
to
those
i
had
seen
in
the
museum
in
london
the
work
of
the
south
sea
islanders
we
laughed
at
our
spoons
which
would
have
required
mouths
from
ear
to
ear
to
eat
with
them
fritz
declared
that
the
curve
of
the
rind
was
the
cause
of
that
defect
if
the
spoons
had
been
smaller
they
would
have
been
flat
and
you
might
as
well
eat
soup
with
an
as
with
a
shovel
while
we
talked
we
did
not
neglect
looking
about
for
our
lost
companions
but
in
vain
at
last
we
arrived
at
a
place
where
a
tongue
of
land
ran
to
some
distance
into
the
sea
on
which
was
an
elevated
spot
favourable
for
observation
we
attained
the
summit
with
great
labour
and
saw
before
us
a
magnificent
prospect
of
land
and
water
but
with
all
the
aid
our
excellent
telescope
gave
us
we
could
in
no
direction
discover
any
trace
of
man
nature
only
appeared
in
her
greatest
beauty
the
shore
enclosed
a
large
bay
which
terminated
on
the
other
side
in
a
promontory
the
gentle
rippling
of
the
waves
the
varied
verdure
of
the
woods
and
the
multitude
of
novelties
around
us
would
have
filled
us
with
delight
but
for
the
painful
recollection
of
those
who
we
now
were
compelled
to
believe
were
buried
beneath
that
glittering
water
we
did
not
feel
less
however
the
mercy
of
god
who
had
preserved
us
and
given
us
a
home
with
a
prospect
of
subsistence
and
safety
we
had
not
yet
met
with
any
dangerous
animals
nor
could
we
perceive
any
huts
of
savages
i
remarked
to
my
son
that
god
seemed
to
have
destined
us
to
a
solitary
life
in
this
rich
country
unless
some
vessel
should
reach
these
shores
and
his
will
be
done
added
i
it
must
be
for
the
best
now
let
us
retire
to
that
pretty
wood
to
rest
ourselves
and
eat
our
dinner
before
we
return
we
proceeded
towards
a
pleasant
wood
of
but
before
reaching
it
had
to
pass
through
an
immense
number
of
reeds
which
greatly
obstructed
our
road
we
were
moreover
fearful
of
treading
on
the
deadly
serpents
who
choose
such
retreats
we
made
turk
walk
before
us
to
give
notice
and
i
cut
a
long
thick
cane
as
a
weapon
of
defence
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
glutinous
juice
oozing
from
the
end
of
the
cut
cane
i
tasted
it
and
was
convinced
that
we
had
met
with
a
plantation
of
i
sucked
more
of
it
and
found
myself
singularly
refreshed
i
said
nothing
to
fritz
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
making
the
discovery
himself
he
was
walking
a
few
paces
before
me
and
i
called
to
him
to
cut
himself
a
cane
like
mine
which
he
did
and
soon
found
out
the
riches
it
contained
he
cried
out
in
ecstasy
oh
papa
papa
syrup
of
delicious
how
delighted
will
dear
mamma
and
my
brothers
be
when
i
carry
some
to
them
he
went
on
sucking
pieces
of
cane
so
greedily
that
i
checked
him
recommending
moderation
he
was
then
content
to
take
some
pieces
to
regale
himself
as
he
walked
home
loading
himself
with
a
huge
burden
for
his
mother
and
brothers
we
now
entered
the
wood
of
palms
to
eat
our
dinner
when
suddenly
a
number
of
monkeys
alarmed
by
our
approach
and
the
barking
of
the
dog
fled
like
lightning
to
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
then
grinned
frightfully
at
us
with
loud
cries
of
defiance
as
i
saw
the
trees
were
i
hoped
to
obtain
by
means
of
the
monkeys
a
supply
of
the
nuts
in
the
state
when
filled
with
milk
i
held
fritz
arm
who
was
preparing
to
shoot
at
them
to
his
great
vexation
as
he
was
irritated
against
the
poor
monkeys
for
their
derisive
gestures
but
i
told
him
that
though
no
patron
of
monkeys
myself
i
could
not
allow
it
we
had
no
right
to
kill
any
animal
except
in
defence
or
as
a
means
of
supporting
life
besides
the
monkeys
would
be
of
more
use
to
us
living
than
dead
as
i
would
show
him
i
began
to
throw
stones
at
the
monkeys
not
being
able
of
course
to
reach
the
place
of
their
retreat
and
they
in
their
anger
and
in
the
spirit
of
imitation
gathered
the
nuts
and
hurled
them
on
us
in
such
quantities
that
we
had
some
difficulty
in
escaping
from
them
we
had
soon
a
large
stock
of
fritz
enjoyed
the
success
of
the
stratagem
and
when
the
shower
subsided
he
collected
as
many
as
he
wished
we
then
sat
down
and
tasted
some
of
the
milk
through
the
three
small
holes
which
we
opened
with
our
knives
we
then
divided
some
with
our
hatchets
and
quenched
our
thirst
with
the
liquor
which
has
not
however
a
very
agreeable
flavour
we
liked
best
a
sort
of
thick
cream
which
adheres
to
the
shells
from
which
we
scraped
it
with
our
spoons
and
mixing
it
with
the
juice
of
the
we
produced
a
delicious
dish
turk
had
the
rest
of
the
lobster
which
we
now
despised
with
some
biscuit
we
then
got
up
i
tied
some
nuts
together
by
their
stems
and
threw
them
over
my
shoulder
fritz
took
his
bundle
of
canes
and
we
set
out
homewards
chapter
iv
fritz
groaned
heavily
under
the
weight
of
his
canes
as
we
travelled
on
and
pitied
the
poor
negroes
who
had
to
carry
such
heavy
burdens
of
them
he
then
in
imitation
of
me
tried
to
refresh
himself
by
sucking
a
but
was
surprised
to
find
he
failed
in
extracting
any
of
the
juice
at
last
after
some
reflection
he
said
ah
i
remember
if
there
is
no
opening
made
for
the
air
i
can
get
nothing
out
i
requested
him
to
find
a
remedy
for
this
i
will
make
an
opening
said
he
above
the
first
knot
in
the
cane
if
i
draw
in
my
breath
in
sucking
and
thus
make
a
vacuum
in
my
mouth
the
outer
air
then
forces
itself
through
the
hole
i
have
made
to
fill
this
vacuum
and
carries
the
juice
along
with
it
and
when
this
division
of
the
cane
is
emptied
i
can
proceed
to
pierce
above
the
next
knot
i
am
only
afraid
that
going
on
this
way
we
shall
have
nothing
but
empty
canes
to
carry
to
our
friends
i
told
him
that
i
was
more
afraid
the
sun
might
turn
the
syrup
sour
before
we
got
our
canes
home
therefore
we
need
not
spare
them
well
at
any
rate
said
he
i
have
filled
my
flask
with
the
milk
of
the
to
regale
them
i
told
him
i
feared
another
disappointment
for
the
milk
of
the
removed
from
the
shell
spoiled
sooner
than
the
juice
i
warned
him
that
the
milk
exposed
to
the
sun
in
his
tin
flask
was
probably
become
vinegar
he
instantly
took
the
bottle
from
his
shoulder
and
uncorked
it
when
the
liquor
flew
out
with
a
report
foaming
like
champaign
i
congratulated
him
on
his
new
manufacture
and
said
we
must
beware
of
intoxication
oh
taste
papa
said
he
it
is
delicious
not
at
all
like
vinegar
but
capital
new
sweet
sparkling
wine
this
will
be
the
best
treat
if
it
remains
in
this
state
i
fear
it
will
not
be
so
said
i
this
is
the
first
stage
of
fermentation
when
this
is
over
and
the
liquor
is
cleared
it
is
a
sort
of
wine
or
fermented
liquor
more
or
less
agreeable
according
to
the
material
used
by
applying
heat
a
second
and
slower
fermentation
succeeds
and
the
liquor
becomes
vinegar
then
comes
on
a
third
stage
which
deprives
it
of
its
strength
and
spoils
it
i
fear
in
this
burning
climate
you
will
carry
home
only
vinegar
or
something
still
more
offensive
but
let
us
drink
each
other
health
now
but
prudently
or
we
shall
soon
feel
the
effects
of
this
potent
beverage
perfectly
refreshed
we
went
on
cheerfully
to
the
place
where
we
had
left
our
gourd
utensils
we
found
them
quite
dry
and
hard
as
bone
we
had
no
difficulty
in
carrying
them
in
our
we
had
scarcely
got
through
the
little
wood
where
we
had
breakfasted
when
turk
darted
furiously
on
a
troop
of
monkeys
who
were
sporting
about
and
had
not
perceived
him
he
immediately
seized
a
female
holding
a
young
one
in
her
arms
which
impeded
her
flight
and
had
killed
and
devoured
the
poor
mother
before
we
could
reach
him
the
young
one
had
hidden
itself
among
the
long
grass
when
fritz
arrived
he
had
run
with
all
his
might
losing
his
hat
bottle
and
canes
but
could
not
prevent
the
murder
of
the
poor
mother
the
little
monkey
no
sooner
saw
him
than
it
leaped
upon
his
shoulders
fastening
its
paws
in
his
curls
and
neither
cries
threats
nor
shaking
could
rid
him
of
it
i
ran
up
to
him
laughing
for
i
saw
the
little
creature
could
not
hurt
him
and
tried
in
vain
to
disengage
it
i
told
him
he
must
carry
it
thus
it
was
evident
the
sagacious
little
creature
having
lost
its
mother
had
adopted
him
for
a
father
i
succeeded
at
last
in
quietly
releasing
him
and
took
the
little
orphan
which
was
no
bigger
than
a
cat
in
my
arms
pitying
its
helplessness
the
mother
appeared
as
tall
as
fritz
i
was
reluctant
to
add
another
mouth
to
the
number
we
had
to
feed
but
fritz
earnestly
begged
to
keep
it
offering
to
divide
his
share
of
milk
with
it
till
we
had
our
cows
i
consented
on
condition
that
he
took
care
of
it
and
taught
it
to
be
obedient
to
him
turk
in
the
mean
time
was
feasting
on
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
mother
fritz
would
have
driven
him
off
but
i
saw
we
had
not
food
sufficient
to
satisfy
this
voracious
animal
and
we
might
ourselves
be
in
danger
from
his
appetite
we
left
him
therefore
with
his
prey
the
little
orphan
sitting
on
the
shoulder
of
his
protector
while
i
carried
the
canes
turk
soon
overtook
us
and
was
received
very
coldly
we
reproached
him
with
his
cruelty
but
he
was
quite
unconcerned
and
continued
to
walk
after
fritz
the
little
monkey
seemed
uneasy
at
the
sight
of
him
and
crept
into
bosom
much
to
his
inconvenience
but
a
thought
struck
him
he
tied
the
monkey
with
a
cord
to
turk
back
leading
the
dog
by
another
cord
as
he
was
very
rebellious
at
first
but
our
threats
and
caresses
at
last
induced
him
to
submit
to
his
burden
we
proceeded
slowly
and
i
could
not
help
anticipating
the
mirth
of
my
little
ones
when
they
saw
us
approach
like
a
pair
of
i
advised
fritz
not
to
correct
the
dogs
for
attacking
and
killing
unknown
animals
heaven
bestows
the
dog
on
man
as
well
as
the
horse
for
a
friend
and
protector
fritz
thought
we
were
very
fortunate
then
in
having
two
such
faithful
dogs
he
only
regretted
that
our
horses
had
died
on
the
passage
and
only
left
us
the
ass
let
us
not
disdain
the
ass
said
i
i
wish
we
had
him
here
he
is
of
a
very
fine
breed
and
would
be
as
useful
as
a
horse
to
us
in
such
conversations
we
arrived
at
the
banks
of
our
river
before
we
were
aware
flora
barked
to
announce
our
approach
and
turk
answered
so
loudly
that
the
terrified
little
monkey
leaped
from
his
back
to
the
shoulder
of
its
protector
and
would
not
come
down
turk
ran
off
to
meet
his
companion
and
our
dear
family
soon
appeared
on
the
opposite
shore
shouting
with
joy
at
our
happy
return
we
crossed
at
the
same
place
as
we
had
done
in
the
morning
and
embraced
each
other
then
began
such
a
noise
of
exclamations
a
monkey
a
real
live
monkey
ah
how
delightful
how
glad
we
are
how
did
you
catch
him
he
is
very
ugly
said
little
francis
who
was
almost
afraid
of
him
he
is
prettier
than
you
are
said
jack
see
how
he
laughs
how
i
should
like
to
see
him
eat
if
we
only
had
some
said
ernest
have
you
found
any
and
are
they
good
have
you
had
any
unpleasant
adventures
asked
my
wife
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
replying
to
so
many
questions
and
exclamations
at
length
when
we
got
a
little
peace
i
told
them
that
though
i
had
brought
them
all
sorts
of
good
things
i
had
unfortunately
not
met
with
any
of
our
companions
god
will
be
done
said
my
wife
let
us
thank
him
for
saving
us
and
again
bringing
us
together
now
this
day
has
seemed
an
age
but
put
down
your
loads
and
let
us
hear
your
adventures
we
have
not
been
idle
but
we
are
less
fatigued
than
you
boys
assist
your
father
and
brother
jack
took
my
gun
ernest
the
francis
the
and
my
wife
the
fritz
distributed
his
and
placed
the
monkey
on
turk
back
to
the
amusement
of
the
children
he
begged
ernest
to
carry
his
gun
but
he
complained
of
being
overloaded
with
the
great
bowls
his
indulgent
mother
took
them
from
him
and
we
proceeded
to
the
tent
fritz
thought
ernest
would
not
have
relinquished
the
bowls
if
he
had
known
what
they
contained
and
called
out
to
tell
him
they
were
give
them
to
me
cried
ernest
i
will
carry
them
mamma
and
the
gun
too
his
mother
declined
giving
them
i
can
throw
away
these
sticks
said
he
and
carry
the
gun
in
my
hand
i
would
advise
you
not
observed
fritz
for
the
sticks
are
cried
they
all
surrounding
fritz
who
had
to
give
them
the
history
and
teach
them
the
art
of
sucking
the
canes
my
wife
who
had
a
proper
respect
for
sugar
in
her
housekeeping
was
much
pleased
with
this
discovery
and
the
history
of
all
our
acquisitions
which
i
displayed
to
her
nothing
gave
her
so
much
pleasure
as
our
plates
and
dishes
which
were
actual
necessaries
we
went
to
our
kitchen
and
were
gratified
to
see
preparations
going
on
for
a
good
supper
my
wife
had
planted
a
forked
stick
on
each
side
the
hearth
on
these
rested
a
long
thin
wand
on
which
all
sorts
of
fish
were
roasting
francis
being
intrusted
to
turn
the
spit
on
the
other
side
was
impaled
a
goose
on
another
spit
and
a
row
of
formed
the
besides
this
the
iron
pot
was
on
the
fire
from
which
arose
the
savoury
odour
of
a
good
soup
behind
the
hearth
stood
one
of
the
hogsheads
opened
and
containing
the
finest
dutch
cheeses
enclosed
in
cases
of
lead
all
this
was
very
tempting
to
hungry
travellers
and
very
unlike
a
supper
on
a
desert
island
i
could
not
think
my
family
had
been
idle
when
i
saw
such
a
result
of
their
labours
i
was
only
sorry
they
had
killed
the
goose
as
i
wished
to
be
economical
with
our
poultry
have
no
uneasiness
said
my
wife
this
is
not
from
our
it
is
a
wild
goose
killed
by
ernest
it
is
a
sort
of
penguin
i
believe
said
ernest
distinguished
by
the
name
of
and
so
stupid
that
i
knocked
it
down
with
a
stick
it
is
has
a
long
narrow
beak
a
little
curved
downwards
i
have
preserved
the
head
and
neck
for
you
to
examine
it
exactly
resembles
the
penguin
of
my
book
of
natural
history
i
pointed
out
to
him
the
advantages
of
study
and
was
making
more
inquiries
about
the
form
and
habits
of
the
bird
when
my
wife
requested
me
to
defer
my
catechism
of
natural
history
ernest
has
killed
the
bird
added
she
i
received
it
we
shall
eat
it
what
more
would
you
have
let
the
poor
child
have
the
pleasure
of
examining
and
tasting
the
very
well
replied
i
fritz
must
teach
them
how
to
open
them
and
we
must
not
forget
the
little
monkey
who
has
lost
his
mother
milk
i
have
tried
him
cried
jack
and
he
will
eat
nothing
i
told
them
he
had
not
yet
learnt
to
eat
and
we
must
feed
him
with
milk
till
we
could
get
something
better
jack
generously
offered
all
his
share
but
ernest
and
francis
were
anxious
to
taste
the
milk
themselves
but
the
monkey
must
live
said
jack
petulantly
and
so
must
we
all
said
mamma
supper
is
ready
and
we
will
reserve
the
for
dessert
we
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
the
supper
was
served
on
our
service
which
answered
the
purpose
admirably
my
impatient
boys
had
broken
the
nuts
which
they
found
excellent
and
they
made
themselves
spoons
of
the
shell
jack
had
taken
care
the
monkey
had
his
share
they
dipped
the
corner
of
their
handkerchiefs
in
the
milk
and
let
him
suck
them
they
were
going
to
break
up
some
more
nuts
after
emptying
them
through
the
natural
holes
but
i
stopped
them
and
called
for
a
saw
i
carefully
divided
the
nuts
with
this
instrument
and
soon
provided
us
each
with
a
neat
basin
for
our
soup
to
the
great
comfort
of
my
dear
wife
who
was
gratified
by
seeing
us
able
to
eat
like
civilized
beings
fritz
begged
now
to
enliven
the
repast
by
introducing
his
champaign
i
consented
requesting
him
however
to
taste
it
himself
before
he
served
it
what
was
his
mortification
to
find
it
vinegar
but
we
consoled
ourselves
by
using
it
as
sauce
to
our
goose
a
great
improvement
also
to
the
fish
we
had
now
to
hear
the
history
of
our
supper
jack
and
francis
had
caught
the
fish
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
my
active
wife
had
performed
the
most
laborious
duty
in
rolling
the
hogshead
to
the
place
and
breaking
open
the
head
the
sun
was
going
down
as
we
finished
supper
and
recollecting
how
rapidly
night
succeeded
we
hastened
to
our
tent
where
we
found
our
beds
much
more
comfortable
from
the
kind
attention
of
the
good
mother
who
had
collected
a
large
addition
of
dried
grass
after
prayers
we
all
lay
down
the
monkey
between
jack
and
fritz
carefully
covered
with
moss
to
keep
him
warm
the
fowls
went
to
their
roost
as
on
the
previous
night
and
after
our
fatigue
we
were
all
soon
in
a
profound
sleep
we
had
not
slept
long
when
a
great
commotion
among
the
dogs
and
fowls
announced
the
presence
of
an
enemy
my
wife
fritz
and
i
each
seizing
a
gun
rushed
out
by
the
light
of
the
moon
we
saw
a
terrible
battle
going
on
our
brave
dogs
were
surrounded
by
a
dozen
jackals
three
or
four
were
extended
dead
but
our
faithful
animals
were
nearly
overpowered
by
numbers
when
we
arrived
i
was
glad
to
find
nothing
worse
than
jackals
fritz
and
i
fired
on
them
two
fell
dead
and
the
others
fled
slowly
evidently
wounded
turk
and
flora
pursued
and
completed
the
business
and
then
like
true
dogs
devoured
their
fallen
foes
regardless
of
the
bonds
of
relationship
all
being
quiet
again
we
retired
to
our
beds
fritz
obtaining
leave
to
drag
the
jackal
he
had
killed
towards
the
tent
to
save
it
from
the
dogs
and
to
show
to
his
brothers
next
morning
this
he
accomplished
with
difficulty
for
it
was
as
big
as
a
large
dog
we
all
slept
peacefully
the
remainder
of
the
night
till
the
crowing
of
the
cock
awoke
my
wife
and
myself
to
a
consultation
on
the
business
of
the
day
chapter
well
my
dear
i
began
i
feel
rather
alarmed
at
all
the
labours
i
see
before
me
a
voyage
to
the
vessel
is
indispensable
if
we
wish
to
save
our
cattle
and
many
other
things
that
may
be
useful
to
us
on
the
other
hand
i
should
like
to
have
a
more
secure
shelter
for
ourselves
and
our
property
than
this
tent
with
patience
order
and
perseverance
all
may
be
done
said
my
good
counsellor
and
whatever
uneasiness
your
voyage
may
give
me
i
yield
to
the
importance
and
utility
of
it
let
it
be
done
and
have
no
care
for
the
morrow
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
as
our
blessed
lord
has
said
it
was
then
agreed
that
the
three
youngest
children
should
remain
with
my
wife
and
fritz
the
strongest
and
most
active
should
accompany
me
i
then
arose
and
woke
my
children
for
the
important
duties
of
the
day
fritz
jumped
up
the
first
and
ran
for
his
jackal
which
had
stiffened
in
the
cold
of
the
night
he
placed
it
on
its
four
legs
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
to
surprise
his
brothers
but
no
sooner
did
the
dogs
see
it
erect
than
they
flew
at
it
and
would
have
torn
it
to
pieces
if
he
had
not
soothed
them
and
called
them
off
however
their
barking
effectually
roused
the
boys
who
rushed
out
to
see
the
cause
jack
issued
first
with
the
monkey
on
his
shoulder
but
no
sooner
did
the
little
creature
see
the
jackal
than
he
sprang
into
the
tent
and
hid
himself
among
the
moss
till
only
the
tip
of
his
nose
was
visible
all
were
astonished
to
see
this
large
yellow
animal
standing
francis
thought
it
was
a
wolf
jack
said
it
was
only
a
dead
dog
and
ernest
in
a
pompous
tone
pronounced
it
to
be
a
golden
fox
fritz
laughed
at
the
learned
professor
who
knew
the
agouti
immediately
and
now
called
a
jackal
a
golden
fox
i
judged
by
the
peculiar
characteristics
said
ernest
examining
it
carefully
oh
the
characteristics
said
fritz
ironically
do
you
think
it
may
be
a
golden
wolf
pray
do
be
so
cross
brother
said
ernest
with
tears
in
his
eyes
perhaps
you
would
not
have
known
the
name
if
papa
had
not
told
you
i
reproved
fritz
for
his
ridicule
of
his
brother
and
ernest
for
so
easily
taking
offence
and
to
reconcile
all
i
told
them
that
the
jackal
partook
of
the
nature
of
the
wolf
the
fox
and
the
dog
this
discussion
terminated
i
summoned
them
to
prayers
after
which
we
thought
of
breakfast
we
had
nothing
but
biscuit
which
was
certainly
dry
and
hard
fritz
begged
for
a
little
cheese
with
it
and
ernest
who
was
never
satisfied
like
other
people
took
a
survey
of
the
unopened
hogshead
he
soon
returned
crying
if
we
only
had
a
little
butter
with
our
biscuit
it
would
be
so
good
papa
i
allowed
it
would
be
good
but
it
was
no
use
thinking
of
such
a
thing
let
us
open
the
other
cask
said
he
displaying
a
piece
of
butter
he
had
extracted
through
a
small
crack
on
the
side
your
instinct
for
good
things
has
been
fortunate
for
us
said
i
come
boys
who
wants
bread
and
butter
we
began
to
consider
how
we
should
come
at
the
contents
of
the
hogshead
without
exposing
the
perishable
matter
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
finally
i
pierced
a
hole
in
the
lower
part
of
the
cask
large
enough
for
us
to
draw
out
the
butter
as
we
wanted
it
by
means
of
a
little
wooden
shovel
which
i
soon
made
we
then
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
a
basin
filled
with
good
salt
dutch
butter
we
toasted
our
biscuit
buttered
it
hot
and
agreed
that
it
was
excellent
our
dogs
were
sleeping
by
us
as
we
breakfasted
and
i
remarked
that
they
had
bloody
marks
of
the
last
night
fray
in
some
deep
and
dangerous
wounds
especially
about
the
neck
my
wife
instantly
dressed
the
wounds
with
butter
well
washed
in
cold
water
and
the
poor
animals
seemed
grateful
for
the
ease
it
gave
them
ernest
judiciously
remarked
that
they
ought
to
have
spiked
collars
to
defend
them
from
any
wild
beasts
they
might
encounter
i
will
make
them
collars
said
jack
who
never
hesitated
at
anything
i
was
glad
to
employ
his
inventive
powers
and
ordering
my
children
not
to
leave
their
mother
during
our
absence
but
to
pray
to
god
to
bless
our
undertaking
we
began
our
preparations
for
the
voyage
while
fritz
made
ready
the
boat
i
erected
a
with
a
piece
of
sailcloth
for
a
flag
to
float
as
long
as
all
was
going
on
well
but
if
we
were
wanted
they
were
to
lower
the
flag
and
fire
a
gun
three
times
when
we
would
immediately
return
for
i
had
informed
my
dear
wife
it
might
be
necessary
for
us
to
remain
on
board
all
night
and
she
consented
to
the
plan
on
my
promising
to
pass
the
night
in
our
tubs
instead
of
the
vessel
we
took
nothing
but
our
guns
and
ammunition
relying
on
the
ship
provisions
fritz
would
however
take
the
monkey
that
he
might
give
it
some
milk
from
the
cow
we
took
a
tender
leave
of
each
other
and
embarked
when
we
had
rowed
into
the
middle
of
the
bay
i
perceived
a
strong
current
formed
by
the
water
of
the
river
which
issued
at
a
little
distance
which
i
was
glad
to
take
advantage
of
to
spare
our
labour
it
carried
us
three
parts
of
our
voyage
and
we
rowed
the
remainder
and
entering
the
opening
in
the
vessel
we
secured
our
boat
firmly
and
went
on
board
the
first
care
of
fritz
was
to
feed
the
animals
who
were
on
deck
and
who
all
saluted
us
after
their
fashion
rejoiced
to
see
their
friends
again
as
well
as
to
have
their
wants
supplied
we
put
the
young
monkey
to
a
goat
which
he
sucked
with
extraordinary
grimaces
to
our
infinite
amusement
we
then
took
some
refreshment
ourselves
and
fritz
to
my
great
surprise
proposed
that
we
should
begin
by
adding
a
sail
to
our
boat
he
said
the
current
which
helped
us
to
the
vessel
could
not
carry
us
back
but
the
wind
which
blew
so
strongly
against
us
and
made
our
rowing
so
fatiguing
would
be
of
great
service
if
we
had
a
sail
i
thanked
my
counsellor
for
his
good
advice
and
we
immediately
set
to
the
task
i
selected
a
strong
pole
for
a
mast
and
a
triangular
sail
which
was
fixed
to
a
yard
we
made
a
hole
in
a
plank
to
receive
the
mast
secured
the
plank
on
our
fourth
tub
forming
a
deck
and
then
by
aid
of
a
block
used
to
hoist
and
lower
the
sails
raised
our
mast
finally
two
ropes
fastened
by
one
end
to
the
yard
and
by
the
other
to
each
extremity
of
the
boat
enabled
us
to
direct
the
sail
at
pleasure
fritz
next
ornamented
the
top
of
the
mast
with
a
little
red
streamer
he
then
gave
our
boat
the
name
of
the
and
requested
it
might
henceforward
be
called
the
little
vessel
to
complete
its
equipment
i
contrived
a
rudder
so
that
i
could
direct
the
boat
from
either
end
after
signalling
to
our
friends
that
we
should
not
return
that
night
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
emptying
the
tubs
of
the
stones
we
had
used
for
ballast
and
replacing
them
with
useful
things
powder
and
shot
nails
and
tools
of
all
kinds
pieces
of
cloth
above
all
we
did
not
forget
knives
forks
spoons
and
kitchen
utensils
including
a
in
the
captain
cabin
we
found
some
services
of
silver
pewter
plates
and
dishes
and
a
small
chest
filled
with
bottles
of
choice
wines
all
these
we
took
as
well
as
a
chest
of
eatables
intended
for
the
officers
table
portable
soup
westphalian
hams
bologna
sausages
also
some
bags
of
maize
wheat
and
other
seeds
and
some
potatoes
we
collected
all
the
implements
of
husbandry
we
could
spare
room
for
and
at
the
request
of
fritz
some
hammocks
and
blankets
two
or
three
handsome
guns
and
an
armful
of
sabres
swords
and
lastly
i
embarked
a
barrel
of
sulphur
all
the
cord
and
string
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
and
a
large
roll
of
sailcloth
the
sulphur
was
intended
to
produce
matches
with
our
tubs
were
loaded
to
the
edge
there
was
barely
room
left
for
us
to
sit
and
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
attempt
our
return
if
the
sea
had
not
been
so
calm
night
arrived
we
exchanged
signals
to
announce
security
on
sea
and
land
and
after
prayers
for
the
dear
islanders
we
sought
our
tubs
not
the
most
luxurious
of
dormitories
but
safer
than
the
ship
fritz
slept
soundly
but
i
could
not
close
my
eyes
thinking
of
the
jackals
i
was
however
thankful
for
the
protection
they
had
in
the
dogs
chapter
vi
as
soon
as
day
broke
i
mounted
on
deck
to
look
through
the
telescope
i
saw
my
wife
looking
towards
us
and
the
flag
which
denoted
their
safety
floating
in
the
breeze
satisfied
on
this
important
point
we
enjoyed
our
breakfast
of
biscuit
ham
and
wine
and
then
turned
our
thoughts
to
the
means
of
saving
our
cattle
even
if
we
could
contrive
a
raft
we
could
never
get
all
the
animals
to
remain
still
on
it
we
might
venture
the
huge
sow
in
the
water
but
the
rest
of
the
animals
we
found
would
not
be
able
to
swim
to
shore
at
last
fritz
suggested
the
swimming
apparatus
we
passed
two
hours
in
constructing
them
for
the
cow
and
ass
it
was
necessary
to
have
an
empty
cask
on
each
side
well
bound
in
strong
sailcloth
fastened
by
leather
thongs
over
the
back
and
under
each
animal
for
the
rest
we
merely
tied
a
piece
of
cork
under
their
bodies
the
sow
only
being
unruly
and
giving
us
much
trouble
we
then
fastened
a
cord
to
the
horns
or
neck
of
each
animal
with
a
slip
of
wood
at
the
end
for
a
convenient
handle
luckily
the
waves
had
broken
away
part
of
the
ship
and
left
the
opening
wide
enough
for
the
passage
of
our
troop
we
first
launched
the
ass
into
the
water
by
a
sudden
push
he
swam
away
after
the
first
plunge
very
gracefully
the
cow
sheep
and
goats
followed
quietly
after
the
sow
was
furious
and
soon
broke
loose
from
us
all
but
fortunately
reached
the
shore
long
before
the
rest
we
now
embarked
fastening
all
the
slips
of
wood
to
the
stern
of
the
boat
thus
drawing
our
train
after
us
and
the
wind
filling
our
sail
carried
us
smoothly
towards
the
shore
fritz
exulted
in
his
plan
as
we
certainly
could
never
have
rowed
our
boat
loaded
as
we
were
i
once
more
took
out
my
telescope
and
was
remarking
that
our
party
on
shore
seemed
making
ready
for
some
excursion
when
a
loud
cry
from
fritz
filled
me
with
terror
we
are
lost
we
are
lost
see
what
a
monstrous
fish
though
pale
with
alarm
the
bold
boy
had
seized
his
gun
and
encouraged
by
my
directions
he
fired
two
balls
into
the
head
of
the
monster
as
it
was
preparing
to
dart
on
the
sheep
it
immediately
made
its
escape
leaving
a
long
red
track
to
prove
that
it
was
severely
wounded
being
freed
from
our
enemy
i
now
resumed
the
rudder
and
we
lowered
the
sail
and
rowed
to
shore
the
animals
as
soon
as
the
water
became
low
enough
walked
out
at
their
own
discretion
after
we
had
relieved
them
from
their
swimming
girdles
we
then
secured
our
boat
as
before
and
landed
ourselves
anxiously
looking
round
for
our
friends
we
had
not
long
to
wait
they
came
joyfully
to
greet
us
and
after
our
first
burst
of
pleasure
we
sat
down
to
tell
our
adventures
in
a
regular
form
my
wife
was
overjoyed
to
see
herself
surrounded
by
these
valuable
animals
and
especially
pleased
that
her
son
fritz
had
suggested
so
many
useful
plans
we
next
proceeded
to
disembark
all
our
treasures
i
noticed
that
jack
wore
a
belt
of
yellow
skin
in
which
were
placed
a
pair
of
pistols
and
inquired
where
he
had
got
his
brigand
costume
i
manufactured
it
myself
said
he
and
this
is
not
all
look
at
the
dogs
the
dogs
wore
each
a
collar
of
the
same
skin
as
his
belt
bristling
with
long
nails
the
points
outwards
a
formidable
defence
it
is
my
own
invention
said
he
only
mamma
helped
me
in
the
sewing
but
where
did
you
get
the
leather
the
needle
and
thread
inquired
i
fritz
jackal
supplied
the
skin
said
my
wife
and
my
wonderful
bag
the
rest
there
is
still
more
to
come
from
it
only
say
what
you
want
fritz
evidently
felt
a
little
vexation
at
his
brother
unceremonious
appropriation
of
the
skin
of
the
jackal
which
displayed
itself
in
the
tone
in
which
he
exclaimed
holding
his
nose
keep
at
a
distance
skinner
you
carry
an
intolerable
smell
about
with
you
i
gave
him
a
gentle
hint
of
his
duty
in
the
position
of
eldest
son
and
he
soon
recovered
his
good
humour
however
as
the
body
as
well
as
the
skin
of
the
jackal
was
becoming
offensive
they
united
in
dragging
it
down
to
the
sea
while
jack
placed
his
belt
in
the
sun
to
dry
as
i
saw
no
preparation
for
supper
i
told
fritz
to
bring
the
ham
and
to
the
astonishment
and
joy
of
all
he
returned
with
a
fine
westphalian
ham
which
we
had
cut
into
in
the
morning
i
will
tell
you
said
my
wife
why
we
have
no
supper
prepared
but
first
i
will
make
you
an
omelet
and
she
produced
from
a
basket
a
dozen
turtle
eggs
you
see
said
ernest
they
have
all
the
characteristics
of
those
robinson
crusoe
had
in
his
island
they
are
white
balls
the
skin
of
which
resembles
moistened
parchment
my
wife
promised
to
relate
the
history
of
the
discovery
after
supper
and
set
about
preparing
her
ham
and
omelet
while
fritz
and
i
proceeded
in
unloading
our
cargo
assisted
by
the
useful
ass
supper
was
now
ready
a
tablecloth
was
laid
over
the
and
spread
with
the
plates
and
spoons
from
the
ship
the
ham
was
in
the
middle
and
the
omelet
and
cheese
at
each
end
and
we
made
a
good
meal
surrounded
by
our
subjects
the
dogs
the
fowls
the
pigeons
the
sheep
and
the
goats
waiting
for
our
notice
the
geese
and
ducks
were
more
independent
remaining
in
their
marsh
where
they
lived
in
plenty
on
the
small
crabs
which
abounded
there
after
supper
i
sent
fritz
for
a
bottle
of
the
captain
canary
wine
and
then
requested
my
wife
to
give
us
her
recital
chapter
vii
i
will
spare
you
the
history
of
the
first
day
said
my
good
elizabeth
spent
in
anxiety
about
you
and
attending
to
the
signals
but
this
morning
being
satisfied
that
all
was
going
right
i
sought
before
the
boys
got
up
a
shady
place
to
rest
in
but
in
vain
i
believe
this
barren
shore
has
not
a
single
tree
on
it
then
i
began
to
consider
on
the
necessity
of
searching
for
a
more
comfortable
spot
for
our
residence
and
determined
after
a
slight
repast
to
set
out
with
my
children
across
the
river
on
a
journey
of
discovery
the
day
before
jack
had
busied
himself
in
skinning
the
jackal
with
his
knife
sharpened
on
the
rock
ernest
declining
to
assist
him
in
his
dirty
work
for
which
i
reproved
him
sorry
that
any
fastidiousness
should
deter
him
from
a
labour
of
benefit
to
society
jack
proceeded
to
clean
the
skin
as
well
as
he
was
able
then
procured
from
the
some
long
nails
and
inserted
them
closely
through
the
long
pieces
of
skin
he
had
cut
for
collars
he
then
cut
some
sailcloth
and
made
a
double
lining
over
the
heads
of
the
nails
and
finished
by
giving
me
the
delicate
office
of
sewing
them
together
which
i
could
not
but
comply
with
his
belt
he
first
stretched
on
a
plank
nailing
it
down
and
exposing
it
to
the
sun
lest
it
should
shrink
in
drying
now
for
our
journey
we
took
our
and
some
the
boys
carried
provisions
and
i
had
a
large
flask
of
water
i
took
a
small
hatchet
and
gave
ernest
a
carbine
which
might
be
loaded
with
ball
keeping
his
light
gun
for
myself
i
carefully
secured
the
opening
of
the
tent
with
the
hooks
turk
went
before
evidently
considering
himself
our
guide
and
we
crossed
the
river
with
some
difficulty
as
we
proceeded
i
could
not
help
feeling
thankful
that
you
had
so
early
taught
the
boys
to
use
properly
as
the
defence
of
my
youngest
boy
and
myself
now
depended
on
the
two
boys
of
ten
and
twelve
years
of
age
when
we
attained
the
hill
you
described
to
us
i
was
charmed
with
the
smiling
prospect
and
for
the
first
time
since
our
shipwreck
ventured
to
hope
for
better
things
i
had
remarked
a
beautiful
wood
to
which
i
determined
to
make
our
way
for
a
little
shade
and
a
most
painful
progress
it
was
through
grass
that
was
higher
than
the
heads
as
we
were
struggling
through
it
we
heard
a
strange
rustling
sound
among
the
grass
and
at
the
same
moment
a
bird
of
prodigious
size
rose
and
flew
away
before
the
poor
boys
could
get
their
guns
ready
they
were
much
mortified
and
i
recommended
them
always
to
have
their
guns
in
readiness
for
the
birds
would
not
be
likely
to
wait
till
they
loaded
them
francis
thought
the
bird
was
so
large
it
must
be
an
eagle
but
ernest
ridiculed
the
idea
and
added
that
he
thought
it
must
be
of
the
bustard
tribe
we
went
forward
to
the
spot
from
which
it
had
arisen
when
suddenly
another
bird
of
the
same
kind
though
still
larger
sprung
up
close
to
our
feet
and
was
soon
soaring
above
our
heads
i
could
not
help
laughing
to
see
the
look
of
astonishment
and
confusion
with
which
the
boys
looked
upwards
after
it
at
last
jack
took
off
his
hat
and
making
a
low
bow
said
bird
be
kind
enough
to
pay
us
another
visit
you
will
find
us
very
good
children
we
found
the
large
nest
they
had
left
it
was
rudely
formed
of
dry
grass
and
empty
but
some
fragments
of
were
scattered
near
as
if
the
young
had
been
recently
hatched
we
therefore
concluded
that
they
had
escaped
among
the
grass
doctor
ernest
immediately
began
a
lecture
observe
francis
these
birds
could
not
be
eagles
which
do
not
form
their
nests
on
the
ground
neither
do
their
young
run
as
soon
as
they
are
hatched
these
must
be
of
the
tribe
an
order
of
birds
such
as
quails
partridges
turkeys
and
from
the
sort
of
feathered
moustache
which
i
observed
at
the
corner
of
the
beak
i
should
pronounce
that
these
were
bustards
but
we
had
now
reached
the
little
wood
and
our
learned
friend
had
sufficient
employment
in
scrutinizing
and
endeavouring
to
classify
the
immense
number
of
beautiful
unknown
birds
which
sung
and
fluttered
about
us
apparently
regardless
of
our
intrusion
we
found
that
what
we
thought
a
wood
was
merely
a
group
of
a
dozen
trees
of
a
height
far
beyond
any
i
had
ever
seen
and
apparently
belonging
rather
to
the
air
than
the
earth
the
trunks
springing
from
roots
which
formed
a
series
of
supporting
arches
jack
climbed
one
of
the
arches
and
measured
the
trunk
of
the
tree
with
a
piece
of
packthread
he
found
it
to
be
feet
i
made
steps
round
the
roots
between
the
roots
and
the
lowest
branches
it
seemed
about
forty
or
fifty
feet
the
branches
are
thick
and
strong
and
the
leaves
are
of
a
moderate
size
and
resemble
our
a
thick
short
smooth
turf
clothed
the
ground
beneath
and
around
the
detached
roots
of
the
trees
and
everything
combined
to
render
this
one
of
the
most
delicious
spots
the
mind
could
conceive
here
we
rested
and
made
our
repast
a
clear
rivulet
ran
near
us
and
offered
its
agreeable
waters
for
our
refreshment
our
dogs
soon
joined
us
but
i
was
astonished
to
find
they
did
not
crave
for
food
but
laid
down
to
sleep
at
our
feet
for
myself
so
safe
and
happy
did
i
feel
that
i
could
not
but
think
that
if
we
could
contrive
a
dwelling
on
the
branches
of
one
of
these
trees
we
should
be
in
perfect
peace
and
safety
we
set
out
on
our
return
taking
the
road
by
the
in
case
the
waves
had
cast
up
anything
from
the
wreck
of
the
vessel
we
found
a
quantity
of
timber
chests
and
casks
but
all
too
heavy
to
bring
we
succeeded
in
dragging
them
as
well
as
we
could
out
of
the
reach
of
the
tide
our
dogs
in
the
mean
time
fishing
for
crabs
with
which
they
regaled
themselves
much
to
their
own
satisfaction
and
to
mine
as
i
now
saw
they
would
be
able
to
provide
their
own
food
as
we
rested
from
our
rough
labour
i
saw
flora
scratching
in
the
sand
and
swallowing
something
with
great
relish
ernest
watched
and
then
said
very
quietly
are
turtles
eggs
we
drove
away
the
dog
and
collected
about
two
dozen
leaving
her
the
rest
as
a
reward
for
her
discovery
while
we
were
carefully
depositing
our
spoil
in
the
we
were
astonished
at
the
sight
of
a
sail
ernest
was
certain
it
was
papa
and
fritz
and
though
francis
was
in
dread
that
it
should
be
the
savages
who
visited
robinson
crusoe
island
coming
to
eat
us
up
we
were
soon
enabled
to
calm
his
fears
we
crossed
the
river
by
leaping
from
stone
to
stone
and
hastening
to
the
arrived
to
greet
you
on
your
happy
return
and
i
understand
my
dear
said
i
that
you
have
discovered
a
tree
sixty
feet
high
where
you
wish
we
should
perch
like
fowls
but
how
are
we
to
get
up
oh
you
must
remember
answered
she
the
large
near
our
native
town
in
which
was
a
we
used
to
ascend
to
it
by
a
wooden
staircase
could
you
not
contrive
something
of
the
sort
in
one
of
these
gigantic
trees
where
we
might
sleep
in
peace
fearing
neither
jackals
nor
any
other
terrible
nocturnal
enemy
i
promised
to
consider
this
plan
hoping
at
least
that
we
might
make
a
commodious
and
shady
dwelling
among
the
roots
we
were
to
examine
it
we
then
performed
our
evening
devotions
and
retired
to
rest
chapter
viii
now
my
dear
elizabeth
said
i
waking
early
next
morning
let
us
talk
a
little
on
this
grand
project
of
changing
our
residence
to
which
there
are
many
objections
first
it
seems
wise
to
remain
on
the
spot
where
providence
has
cast
us
where
we
can
have
at
once
means
of
support
drawn
from
the
ship
and
security
from
all
attacks
protected
by
the
rock
the
river
and
the
sea
on
all
sides
my
wife
distrusted
the
river
which
could
not
protect
us
from
the
jackals
and
complained
of
the
intolerable
heat
of
this
sandy
desert
of
her
distaste
for
such
food
as
oysters
and
wild
geese
and
lastly
of
her
agony
of
mind
when
we
ventured
to
the
wreck
willingly
renouncing
all
its
treasures
and
begging
we
might
rest
content
with
the
blessings
we
already
had
there
is
some
truth
in
your
objections
said
i
and
perhaps
we
may
erect
a
dwelling
under
the
roots
of
your
favourite
tree
but
among
these
rocks
we
must
have
a
storehouse
for
our
goods
and
a
retreat
in
case
of
invasion
i
hope
by
blowing
off
some
pieces
of
the
rock
with
powder
to
be
able
to
fortify
the
part
next
the
river
leaving
a
secret
passage
known
only
to
ourselves
this
would
make
it
impregnable
but
before
we
proceed
we
must
have
a
bridge
to
convey
our
baggage
across
the
river
a
bridge
said
she
in
a
tone
of
vexation
then
when
shall
we
get
from
here
why
can
not
we
ford
it
as
usual
the
cow
and
ass
could
carry
our
stores
i
explained
to
her
how
necessary
it
was
for
our
ammunition
and
provision
to
be
conveyed
over
without
risk
of
wetting
and
begged
her
to
manufacture
some
bags
and
baskets
and
leave
the
bridge
to
me
and
my
boys
if
we
succeeded
it
would
always
be
useful
as
for
fear
of
danger
from
lightning
or
accident
i
intended
to
make
a
among
the
rocks
the
important
question
was
now
decided
i
called
up
my
sons
and
communicated
our
plans
to
them
they
were
greatly
delighted
though
somewhat
alarmed
at
the
formidable
project
of
the
bridge
besides
the
delay
was
vexatious
they
were
all
anxious
for
a
removal
into
the
of
as
they
chose
to
call
it
we
read
prayers
and
then
thought
of
breakfast
the
monkey
sucked
one
of
the
goats
as
if
it
had
been
its
mother
my
wife
milked
the
cow
and
gave
us
boiled
milk
with
biscuit
for
our
breakfast
part
of
which
she
put
in
a
flask
for
us
to
take
on
our
expedition
we
then
prepared
our
boat
for
a
voyage
to
the
vessel
to
procure
planks
and
timber
for
our
bridge
i
took
both
ernest
and
fritz
as
i
foresaw
our
cargo
would
be
weighty
and
require
all
our
hands
to
bring
it
to
shore
we
rowed
vigorously
till
we
got
into
the
current
which
soon
carried
us
beyond
the
bay
we
had
scarcely
reached
a
little
isle
at
the
entrance
when
we
saw
a
vast
number
of
gulls
and
other
fluttering
with
discordant
cries
over
it
i
hoisted
the
sail
and
we
approached
rapidly
and
when
near
enough
we
stepped
on
shore
and
saw
that
the
birds
were
feasting
so
eagerly
on
the
remains
of
a
huge
fish
that
they
did
not
even
notice
our
approach
we
might
have
killed
numbers
even
with
our
sticks
this
fish
was
the
shark
which
fritz
had
so
skilfully
shot
through
the
head
the
night
before
he
found
the
marks
of
his
three
balls
ernest
drew
his
ramrod
from
his
gun
and
struck
so
vigorously
right
and
left
among
the
birds
that
he
killed
some
and
put
the
rest
to
flight
we
then
hastily
cut
off
some
pieces
of
the
skin
of
the
monster
which
i
thought
might
be
useful
and
placed
them
in
our
boat
but
this
was
not
the
only
advantage
we
gained
by
landing
i
perceived
an
immense
quantity
of
wrecked
timber
lying
on
the
shore
of
the
island
which
would
spare
us
our
voyage
to
the
ship
we
selected
such
planks
as
were
fit
for
our
purpose
then
by
the
aid
of
our
and
some
levers
we
had
brought
with
us
we
extricated
the
planks
from
the
sand
and
floated
them
and
binding
the
spars
and
yards
together
with
cords
with
the
planks
above
them
like
a
raft
we
tied
them
to
the
stern
of
our
boat
and
hoisted
our
sail
fritz
as
we
sailed
was
drying
the
shark
skin
which
i
hoped
to
convert
into
files
and
ernest
in
his
usual
reflective
manner
observed
to
me
what
a
beautiful
arrangement
of
providence
it
is
that
the
mouth
of
the
shark
should
be
placed
in
such
a
position
that
he
is
compelled
to
turn
on
his
back
to
seize
his
prey
thus
giving
it
a
chance
of
escape
else
with
his
excessive
voracity
he
might
depopulate
the
ocean
at
last
we
reached
our
and
securing
our
boat
and
calling
out
loudly
we
soon
saw
our
friends
running
from
the
river
each
carried
a
handkerchief
filled
with
some
new
acquisition
and
francis
had
over
his
shoulder
a
small
jack
reached
us
first
and
threw
down
before
us
from
his
handkerchief
some
fine
crawfish
they
had
each
as
many
forming
a
provision
for
many
days
francis
claimed
the
merit
of
the
discovery
jack
related
that
francis
and
he
took
a
walk
to
find
a
good
place
for
the
bridge
thank
you
mr
architect
said
i
then
you
must
superintend
the
workmen
have
you
fixed
on
your
place
yes
yes
cried
he
only
listen
when
we
got
to
the
river
francis
who
was
looking
about
called
out
jack
fritz
jackal
is
covered
with
crabs
come
come
i
ran
to
tell
mamma
who
brought
a
net
that
came
from
the
ship
and
we
caught
these
in
a
few
minutes
and
could
have
got
many
more
if
you
had
not
come
i
commanded
them
to
put
the
smaller
ones
back
into
the
river
reserving
only
as
many
as
we
could
eat
i
was
truly
thankful
to
discover
another
means
of
support
we
now
landed
our
timber
i
had
looked
at
jack
site
for
the
bridge
and
thought
my
little
architect
very
happy
in
his
selection
but
it
was
at
a
great
distance
from
the
timber
i
recollected
the
simplicity
of
the
harness
the
laplanders
used
for
their
reindeer
i
tied
cords
to
the
horns
of
the
cow
as
the
strength
of
this
animal
is
in
the
head
and
then
fastened
the
other
ends
round
the
piece
of
timber
we
wanted
moving
i
placed
a
halter
round
the
neck
of
the
ass
and
attached
the
cords
to
this
we
were
thus
enabled
by
degrees
to
remove
all
our
wood
to
the
chosen
spot
where
the
sides
of
the
river
were
steep
and
appeared
of
equal
height
it
was
necessary
to
know
the
breadth
of
the
river
to
select
the
proper
planks
and
ernest
proposed
to
procure
a
ball
of
packthread
from
his
mother
to
tie
a
stone
to
one
end
of
the
string
and
throw
it
across
the
river
and
to
measure
it
after
drawing
it
back
this
expedient
succeeded
admirably
we
found
the
breadth
to
be
eighteen
feet
but
as
i
proposed
to
give
the
bridge
strength
by
having
three
feet
at
least
resting
on
each
shore
we
chose
some
planks
of
feet
in
length
how
we
were
to
get
these
across
the
river
was
another
question
which
we
prepared
to
discuss
during
dinner
to
which
my
wife
now
summoned
us
our
dinner
consisted
of
a
dish
of
crawfish
and
some
very
good
but
before
we
began
we
admired
her
work
she
had
made
a
pair
of
bags
for
the
ass
sewed
with
packthread
but
having
no
large
needles
she
had
been
obliged
to
pierce
holes
with
a
nail
a
tedious
and
painful
process
well
satisfied
with
her
success
we
turned
to
our
repast
talking
of
our
bridge
which
the
boys
by
anticipation
named
the
we
then
went
to
work
there
happened
to
be
an
old
trunk
of
a
tree
standing
on
the
shore
to
this
i
tied
my
main
beam
by
a
strong
cord
loose
enough
to
turn
round
the
trunk
another
cord
was
attached
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
beam
long
enough
to
cross
the
river
twice
i
took
the
end
of
my
rope
over
the
stream
where
we
had
previously
fixed
the
block
used
in
our
boat
to
a
tree
by
the
hook
which
usually
suspended
it
i
passed
my
rope
and
returned
with
the
end
to
our
own
side
i
then
harnessed
my
cow
and
ass
to
the
end
of
my
rope
and
drove
them
forcibly
from
the
shore
the
beam
turned
slowly
round
the
trunk
then
advanced
and
was
finally
lodged
over
the
river
amidst
the
shouts
of
the
boys
its
own
weight
keeping
it
firm
fritz
and
jack
leaped
on
it
immediately
to
run
across
to
my
great
fear
we
succeeded
in
placing
four
strong
beams
in
the
same
way
and
by
the
aid
of
my
sons
i
arranged
them
at
a
convenient
distance
from
each
other
that
we
might
have
a
broad
and
good
bridge
we
then
laid
down
planks
close
together
across
the
beams
but
not
fixed
as
in
time
of
danger
it
might
be
necessary
rapidly
to
remove
the
bridge
my
wife
and
i
were
as
much
excited
as
the
children
and
ran
across
with
delight
our
bridge
was
at
least
ten
feet
broad
thoroughly
fatigued
with
our
day
of
labour
we
returned
home
supped
and
offered
thanks
to
god
and
went
to
rest
chapter
ix
the
next
morning
after
prayers
i
assembled
my
family
we
took
a
solemn
leave
of
our
first
place
of
refuge
i
cautioned
my
sons
to
be
prudent
and
on
their
guard
and
especially
to
remain
together
during
our
journey
we
then
prepared
for
departure
we
assembled
the
cattle
the
bags
were
fixed
across
the
backs
of
the
cow
and
the
ass
and
loaded
with
all
our
heavy
baggage
our
cooking
utensils
and
provisions
consisting
of
biscuits
butter
cheese
and
portable
soup
our
hammocks
and
blankets
the
captain
service
of
plate
were
all
carefully
packed
in
the
bags
equally
poised
on
each
side
the
animals
all
was
ready
when
my
wife
came
in
haste
with
her
inexhaustible
bag
requesting
a
place
for
it
neither
would
she
consent
to
leave
the
poultry
as
food
for
the
jackals
above
all
francis
must
have
a
place
he
could
not
possibly
walk
all
the
way
i
was
amused
with
the
exactions
of
the
sex
but
consented
to
all
and
made
a
good
place
for
francis
between
the
bags
on
the
back
of
the
ass
the
elder
boys
returned
in
despair
they
could
not
succeed
in
catching
the
fowls
but
the
experienced
mother
laughed
at
them
and
said
she
would
soon
capture
them
if
you
do
said
my
pert
little
jack
i
will
be
contented
to
be
roasted
in
the
place
of
the
first
chicken
taken
then
my
poor
jack
said
his
mother
you
will
soon
be
on
the
spit
remember
that
intellect
has
always
more
power
than
mere
bodily
exertion
look
here
she
scattered
a
few
handfuls
of
grain
before
the
tent
calling
the
fowls
they
soon
all
assembled
including
the
pigeons
then
throwing
more
down
inside
the
tent
they
followed
her
it
was
now
only
necessary
to
close
the
entrance
and
they
were
all
soon
taken
tied
by
the
wings
and
feet
and
being
placed
in
baskets
covered
with
nets
were
added
to
the
rest
of
our
luggage
on
the
backs
of
the
animals
finally
we
conveyed
inside
the
tent
all
we
could
not
carry
away
closing
the
entrance
and
barricading
it
with
chests
and
casks
thus
confiding
all
our
possessions
to
the
care
of
god
we
set
out
on
our
pilgrimage
each
carrying
a
and
a
gun
my
wife
and
her
eldest
son
led
the
way
followed
by
the
cow
and
ass
the
third
division
consisted
of
the
goats
driven
by
jack
the
little
monkey
seated
on
the
back
of
its
nurse
and
grimacing
to
our
great
amusement
next
came
ernest
with
the
sheep
and
i
followed
superintending
the
whole
our
gallant
dogs
acted
as
and
were
continually
passing
from
the
front
to
the
rear
rank
our
march
was
slow
but
orderly
and
quite
patriarchal
we
are
now
travelling
across
the
deserts
as
our
first
fathers
did
said
i
and
as
the
arabs
tartars
and
other
nomade
nations
do
to
this
day
followed
by
their
flocks
and
herds
but
these
people
generally
have
strong
camels
to
bear
their
burdens
instead
of
a
poor
ass
and
cow
i
hope
this
may
be
the
last
of
our
pilgrimages
my
wife
also
hoped
that
once
under
the
shade
of
her
marvellous
trees
we
should
have
no
temptation
to
travel
further
we
now
crossed
our
new
bridge
and
here
the
party
was
happily
augmented
by
a
new
arrival
the
sow
had
proved
very
mutinous
at
setting
out
and
we
had
been
compelled
to
leave
her
she
now
voluntarily
joined
us
seeing
we
were
actually
departing
but
continued
to
grunt
loudly
her
disapprobation
of
our
proceedings
after
we
had
crossed
the
river
we
had
another
embarrassment
the
rich
grass
tempted
our
animals
to
stray
off
to
feed
and
but
for
our
dogs
we
should
never
have
been
able
to
muster
them
again
but
for
fear
of
further
accident
i
commanded
my
advanced
guard
to
take
the
road
by
the
coast
which
offered
no
temptation
to
our
troops
we
had
scarcely
left
the
high
grass
when
our
dogs
rushed
back
into
it
barking
furiously
and
howling
as
if
in
combat
fritz
immediately
prepared
for
action
ernest
drew
near
his
mother
jack
rushed
forward
with
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
i
cautiously
advanced
commanding
them
to
be
discreet
and
cool
but
jack
with
his
usual
impetuosity
leaped
among
the
high
grass
to
the
dogs
and
immediately
returned
clapping
his
hands
and
crying
out
be
quick
papa
a
huge
porcupine
with
quills
as
long
as
my
arm
when
i
got
up
i
really
found
a
porcupine
whom
the
dogs
were
warmly
attacking
it
made
a
frightful
noise
erecting
its
quills
so
boldly
that
the
wounded
animals
howled
with
pain
after
every
attempt
to
seize
it
as
we
were
looking
at
them
jack
drew
a
pistol
from
his
belt
and
discharged
it
directly
into
the
head
of
the
porcupine
which
fell
dead
jack
was
very
proud
of
his
feat
and
fritz
not
a
little
jealous
suggested
that
such
a
little
boy
should
not
be
trusted
with
pistols
as
he
might
have
shot
one
of
the
dogs
or
even
one
of
us
i
forbade
any
envy
or
jealousy
among
the
brothers
and
declared
that
all
did
well
who
acted
for
the
public
good
mamma
was
now
summoned
to
see
the
curious
animal
her
son
valour
had
destroyed
her
first
thought
was
to
dress
the
wounds
made
by
the
quills
which
had
stuck
in
the
noses
of
the
dogs
during
their
attack
in
the
mean
time
i
corrected
my
son
notions
on
the
power
of
this
animal
to
lance
its
darts
when
in
danger
this
is
a
popular
error
nature
has
given
it
a
sufficient
protection
in
its
defensive
and
offensive
armour
as
jack
earnestly
desired
to
carry
his
booty
with
him
i
carefully
imbedded
the
body
in
soft
grass
to
preserve
the
quills
then
packed
it
in
strong
cloth
and
placed
it
on
the
ass
behind
francis
at
last
we
arrived
at
the
end
of
our
journey
and
certainly
the
size
of
the
trees
surpassed
anything
i
could
have
imagined
jack
was
certain
they
were
gigantic
for
my
own
part
i
believed
them
to
be
a
species
of
probably
the
antilles
fig
but
all
thanks
were
given
to
the
kind
mother
who
had
sought
out
such
a
pleasant
home
for
us
at
all
events
we
could
find
a
convenient
shelter
among
the
roots
and
if
we
should
ever
succeed
in
perching
on
the
branches
i
told
her
we
should
be
safe
from
all
wild
beasts
i
would
defy
even
the
bears
of
our
native
mountains
to
climb
these
immense
trunks
totally
destitute
of
branches
we
released
our
animals
from
their
loads
tying
their
fore
legs
together
that
they
might
not
stray
except
the
sow
who
as
usual
did
her
own
way
the
fowls
and
pigeons
we
released
and
left
to
their
own
discretion
we
then
sat
down
on
the
grass
to
consider
where
we
should
establish
ourselves
i
wished
to
mount
the
tree
that
very
night
suddenly
we
heard
to
our
no
slight
alarm
the
report
of
a
gun
but
the
next
moment
the
voice
of
fritz
us
he
had
stolen
out
unnoticed
and
shot
a
beautiful
which
he
displayed
in
great
triumph
well
done
noble
hunter
said
i
you
deserve
the
thanks
of
the
fowls
and
pigeons
they
would
most
probably
have
all
fallen
a
sacrifice
if
you
had
not
slain
their
deadly
foe
pray
wage
war
with
all
his
kind
or
we
shall
not
have
a
chicken
left
for
the
pot
ernest
then
examined
the
animal
with
his
customary
attention
and
declared
that
the
proper
name
was
the
a
fact
fritz
did
not
dispute
only
requesting
that
jack
might
not
meddle
with
the
skin
as
he
wished
to
preserve
it
for
a
belt
i
recommended
them
to
skin
it
immediately
and
give
the
flesh
to
the
dogs
jack
at
the
same
time
determined
to
skin
his
porcupine
to
make
part
of
its
flesh
went
into
the
and
the
rest
was
salted
for
the
next
day
we
then
sought
for
some
flat
stones
in
the
bed
of
the
charming
little
river
that
ran
at
a
little
distance
from
us
and
set
about
constructing
a
francis
collected
dry
wood
for
the
fire
and
while
my
wife
was
occupied
in
preparing
our
supper
i
amused
myself
by
making
some
for
her
rude
work
from
the
quills
of
the
porcupine
i
held
a
large
nail
in
the
fire
till
it
was
then
holding
the
head
in
wet
linen
i
pierced
the
quills
and
made
several
needles
of
various
sizes
to
the
great
contentment
of
our
indefatigable
workwoman
still
occupied
with
the
idea
of
our
castle
in
the
air
i
thought
of
making
a
ladder
of
ropes
but
this
would
be
useless
if
we
did
not
succeed
in
getting
a
cord
over
the
lower
branches
to
draw
it
up
neither
my
sons
nor
myself
could
throw
a
stone
to
which
i
had
fastened
a
cord
over
these
branches
which
were
thirty
feet
above
us
it
was
necessary
to
think
of
some
other
expedient
in
the
mean
time
dinner
was
ready
the
porcupine
made
excellent
soup
and
the
flesh
was
though
rather
hard
my
wife
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
taste
it
but
contented
herself
with
a
slice
of
ham
and
some
cheese
chapter
x
after
dinner
as
i
found
we
could
not
ascend
at
present
i
suspended
our
hammocks
under
the
arched
roots
of
our
tree
and
covering
the
whole
with
sailcloth
we
had
a
shelter
from
the
dew
and
the
insects
while
my
wife
was
employed
making
harness
for
the
cow
and
ass
i
went
with
my
sons
to
the
shore
to
look
for
wood
fit
for
our
use
next
day
we
saw
a
great
quantity
of
wreck
but
none
fit
for
our
purpose
till
ernest
met
with
a
heap
of
bamboo
canes
half
buried
in
sand
and
mud
these
were
exactly
what
i
wanted
i
drew
them
out
of
the
sand
stripped
them
of
their
leaves
cut
them
in
pieces
of
about
four
or
five
feet
long
and
my
sons
each
made
up
a
bundle
to
carry
home
i
then
set
out
to
seek
some
slender
stalks
to
make
arrows
which
i
should
need
in
my
project
we
went
towards
a
thick
grove
which
appeared
likely
to
contain
something
for
my
purpose
we
were
very
cautious
for
fear
of
reptiles
or
other
dangerous
animals
allowing
flora
to
precede
us
when
we
got
near
she
darted
furiously
among
the
bushes
and
out
flew
a
troop
of
beautiful
flamingoes
and
soared
into
the
air
fritz
always
ready
fired
at
them
two
fell
one
quite
dead
the
other
slightly
wounded
in
the
wing
made
use
of
its
long
legs
so
well
that
it
would
have
escaped
if
flora
had
not
seized
it
and
held
it
till
i
came
up
to
take
possession
the
joy
of
fritz
was
extreme
to
have
this
beautiful
creature
alive
he
thought
at
once
of
curing
its
wound
and
domesticating
it
with
our
own
poultry
what
splendid
plumage
said
ernest
and
you
see
he
is
like
the
goose
and
has
long
legs
like
the
stork
thus
he
can
run
as
fast
on
land
as
he
can
swim
in
the
water
yes
said
i
and
fly
as
quickly
in
the
air
these
birds
are
remarkable
for
the
power
and
strength
of
their
wings
few
birds
have
so
many
advantages
my
boys
occupied
themselves
in
binding
their
captive
and
dressing
his
wound
while
i
sought
some
of
the
canes
which
had
done
flowering
to
cut
off
the
hard
ends
to
point
my
arrows
these
are
used
by
the
savages
of
the
antilles
i
then
selected
the
highest
canes
i
could
meet
with
to
assist
me
in
measuring
by
a
geometrical
process
the
height
of
the
tree
ernest
took
the
canes
i
had
the
wounded
flamingo
and
fritz
carried
his
own
game
very
loud
were
the
cries
of
joy
and
astonishment
at
our
approach
the
boys
all
hoped
the
flamingo
might
be
tamed
of
which
i
felt
no
doubt
but
my
wife
was
uneasy
lest
it
should
require
more
food
than
she
could
spare
however
i
assured
her
our
new
guest
would
need
no
attention
as
he
would
provide
for
himself
at
the
feeding
on
small
fishes
worms
and
insects
his
wounds
i
dressed
and
found
they
would
soon
be
healed
i
then
tied
him
to
a
stake
near
the
river
by
a
cord
long
enough
to
allow
him
to
fish
at
his
pleasure
and
in
fact
in
a
few
days
he
learned
to
know
us
and
was
quite
domesticated
meantime
my
boys
had
been
trying
to
measure
the
tree
with
the
long
canes
i
had
brought
and
came
laughing
to
report
to
me
that
i
ought
to
have
got
them
ten
times
as
long
to
reach
even
the
lowest
branches
there
is
a
simpler
mode
than
that
said
i
which
geometry
teaches
us
and
by
which
the
highest
mountains
can
be
measured
i
then
showed
the
method
of
measuring
heights
by
triangles
and
imaginary
lines
using
canes
of
different
lengths
and
cords
instead
of
mathematical
instruments
my
result
was
thirty
feet
to
the
lowest
branches
this
experiment
filled
the
boys
with
wonder
and
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
this
useful
exact
science
which
happily
i
was
able
to
teach
them
fully
i
now
ordered
fritz
to
measure
our
strong
cord
and
the
little
ones
to
collect
all
the
small
string
and
wind
it
i
then
took
a
strong
bamboo
and
made
a
bow
of
it
and
some
arrows
of
the
slender
canes
filling
them
with
wet
sand
to
give
them
weight
and
feathering
them
from
the
dead
flamingo
as
soon
as
my
work
was
completed
the
boys
crowded
round
me
all
begging
to
try
the
bow
and
arrows
i
begged
them
to
be
patient
and
asked
my
wife
to
supply
me
with
a
ball
of
thick
strong
thread
the
enchanted
bag
did
not
fail
us
the
very
ball
i
wanted
appeared
at
her
summons
this
my
little
ones
declared
must
be
magic
but
i
explained
to
them
that
prudence
foresight
and
presence
of
mind
in
danger
such
as
their
good
mother
had
displayed
produced
more
miracles
than
magic
i
then
tied
the
end
of
the
ball
of
thread
to
one
of
my
arrows
fixed
it
in
my
bow
and
sent
it
directly
over
one
of
the
thickest
of
the
lower
branches
of
the
tree
and
falling
to
the
ground
it
drew
the
thread
after
it
charmed
with
this
result
i
hastened
to
complete
my
ladder
fritz
had
measured
our
ropes
and
found
two
of
forty
feet
each
exactly
what
i
wanted
these
i
stretched
on
the
ground
at
about
one
foot
distance
from
each
other
fritz
cut
pieces
of
cane
two
feet
long
which
ernest
passed
to
me
i
placed
these
in
knots
which
i
had
made
in
the
cords
at
about
a
foot
distance
from
each
other
and
jack
fastened
each
end
with
a
long
nail
to
prevent
it
slipping
in
a
very
short
time
our
ladder
was
completed
and
tying
it
to
the
end
of
the
cord
which
went
over
the
branch
we
drew
it
up
without
difficulty
all
the
boys
were
anxious
to
ascend
but
i
chose
jack
as
the
lightest
and
most
active
accordingly
he
ascended
while
his
brothers
and
myself
held
the
ladder
firm
by
the
end
of
the
cord
fritz
followed
him
conveying
a
bag
with
nails
and
hammer
they
were
soon
perched
on
the
branches
huzzaing
to
us
fritz
secured
the
ladder
so
firmly
to
the
branch
that
i
had
no
hesitation
in
ascending
myself
i
carried
with
me
a
large
pulley
fixed
to
the
end
of
a
rope
which
i
attached
to
a
branch
above
us
to
enable
us
to
raise
the
planks
necessary
to
form
the
groundwork
of
our
habitation
i
smoothed
the
branches
a
little
by
aid
of
my
axe
sending
the
boys
down
to
be
out
of
my
way
after
completing
my
day
work
i
descended
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
was
alarmed
to
find
that
fritz
and
jack
were
not
below
and
still
more
so
when
i
heard
their
clear
sweet
voices
at
the
summit
of
the
tree
singing
the
evening
hymn
as
if
to
sanctify
our
future
abode
they
had
climbed
the
tree
instead
of
descending
and
filled
with
wonder
and
reverence
at
the
sublime
view
below
them
had
burst
out
into
the
hymn
of
thanksgiving
to
god
i
could
not
scold
my
dear
boys
when
they
descended
but
directed
them
to
assemble
the
animals
and
to
collect
wood
to
keep
up
fires
during
the
night
in
order
to
drive
away
any
wild
beasts
that
might
be
near
my
wife
then
displayed
her
work
complete
harness
for
our
two
beasts
of
burden
and
in
return
i
promised
her
we
would
establish
ourselves
next
day
in
the
tree
supper
was
now
ready
one
piece
of
the
porcupine
was
roasted
by
the
fire
smelling
deliciously
another
piece
formed
a
rich
soup
a
cloth
was
spread
on
the
turf
the
ham
cheese
butter
and
biscuits
were
placed
upon
it
my
wife
first
assembled
the
fowls
by
throwing
some
grain
to
them
to
accustom
them
to
the
place
we
soon
saw
the
pigeons
fly
to
roost
on
the
higher
branches
of
the
trees
while
the
fowls
perched
on
the
ladder
the
beasts
we
tied
to
the
roots
close
to
us
now
that
our
cares
were
over
we
sat
down
to
a
merry
and
excellent
repast
by
moonlight
then
after
the
prayers
of
the
evening
i
kindled
our
and
we
all
lay
down
to
rest
in
our
hammocks
the
boys
were
rather
discontented
and
complained
of
their
cramped
position
longing
for
the
freedom
of
their
beds
of
moss
but
i
instructed
them
to
lie
as
the
sailors
do
diagonally
and
swinging
the
hammock
and
told
them
that
brave
swiss
boys
might
sleep
as
the
sailors
of
all
nations
were
compelled
to
sleep
after
some
stifled
sighs
and
groans
all
sank
to
rest
except
myself
kept
awake
by
anxiety
for
the
safety
of
the
rest
chapter
xi
my
anxiety
kept
me
awake
till
near
morning
when
after
a
short
sleep
i
rose
and
we
were
soon
all
at
work
my
wife
after
milking
the
cow
and
goats
harnessed
the
cow
and
ass
and
set
out
to
search
for
for
our
use
in
the
mean
time
i
mounted
the
ladder
with
fritz
and
we
set
to
work
stoutly
with
axe
and
saw
to
rid
ourselves
of
all
useless
branches
some
about
six
feet
above
our
foundation
i
left
to
suspend
our
hammocks
from
and
others
a
little
higher
to
support
the
roof
which
at
present
was
to
be
merely
sailcloth
my
wife
succeeded
in
collecting
us
some
boards
and
planks
which
with
her
assistance
and
the
aid
of
the
pulley
we
hoisted
up
we
then
arranged
them
on
the
level
branches
close
to
each
other
in
such
a
manner
as
to
form
a
smooth
and
solid
floor
i
made
a
sort
of
parapet
round
to
prevent
accidents
by
degrees
our
dwelling
began
to
assume
a
distinct
form
the
sailcloth
was
raised
over
the
high
branches
forming
a
roof
and
being
brought
down
on
each
side
was
nailed
to
the
parapet
the
immense
trunk
protected
the
back
of
our
apartment
and
the
front
was
open
to
admit
the
breeze
from
the
sea
which
was
visible
from
this
elevation
we
hoisted
our
hammocks
and
blankets
by
the
pulley
and
suspended
them
my
son
and
i
then
descended
and
as
our
day
was
not
yet
exhausted
we
set
about
constructing
a
rude
table
and
some
benches
from
the
remainder
of
our
wood
which
we
placed
beneath
the
roots
of
the
tree
henceforward
to
be
our
the
little
boys
collected
the
chips
and
pieces
of
wood
for
while
their
mamma
prepared
supper
which
we
needed
much
after
the
extraordinary
fatigues
of
this
day
the
next
day
however
being
sunday
we
looked
forward
to
as
a
day
of
rest
of
recreation
and
thanksgiving
to
the
great
god
who
had
preserved
us
supper
was
now
ready
my
wife
took
a
large
earthen
pot
from
the
fire
which
contained
a
good
stew
made
of
the
flamingo
which
ernest
had
told
her
was
an
old
bird
and
would
not
be
eatable
if
dressed
any
other
way
his
brothers
laughed
heartily
and
called
him
the
cook
he
was
however
quite
right
the
stew
well
seasoned
was
excellent
and
we
picked
the
very
bones
whilst
we
were
thus
occupied
the
living
flamingo
accompanying
the
rest
of
the
fowls
and
free
from
bonds
came
in
quite
tame
to
claim
his
share
of
the
repast
evidently
quite
unsuspicious
that
we
were
devouring
his
mate
he
did
not
seem
at
all
inclined
to
quit
us
the
little
monkey
too
was
quite
at
home
with
the
boys
leaping
from
one
to
another
for
food
which
he
took
in
his
forepaws
and
ate
with
such
absurd
mimicry
of
their
actions
that
he
kept
us
in
continual
convulsions
of
laughter
to
augment
our
satisfaction
our
great
sow
who
had
deserted
us
for
two
days
returned
of
her
own
accord
grunting
her
joy
at
our
my
wife
welcomed
her
with
particular
distinction
treating
her
with
all
the
milk
we
had
to
spare
for
as
she
had
no
dairy
utensils
to
make
cheese
and
butter
it
was
best
thus
to
dispose
of
our
superfluity
i
promised
her
on
our
next
voyage
to
the
ship
to
procure
all
these
necessaries
this
she
could
not
however
hear
of
without
shuddering
the
boys
now
lighted
the
fires
for
the
night
the
dogs
were
tied
to
the
roots
of
the
tree
as
a
protection
against
invaders
and
we
commenced
our
ascent
my
three
eldest
sons
soon
ran
up
the
ladder
my
wife
followed
with
more
deliberation
but
arrived
safely
my
own
journey
was
more
difficult
as
besides
having
to
carry
francis
on
my
back
i
had
detached
the
lower
part
of
the
ladder
from
the
roots
where
it
was
nailed
in
order
to
be
able
to
draw
it
up
during
the
night
we
were
thus
as
safe
in
our
castle
as
the
knights
of
old
when
their
drawbridge
was
raised
we
retired
to
our
hammocks
free
from
care
and
did
not
wake
till
the
sun
shone
brightly
in
upon
us
chapter
xii
next
morning
all
awoke
in
good
spirits
i
told
them
that
on
this
the
lord
day
we
would
do
no
work
that
it
was
appointed
not
only
for
a
day
of
rest
but
a
day
when
we
must
as
much
as
possible
turn
our
hearts
from
the
vanities
of
the
world
to
god
himself
thank
him
worship
him
and
serve
him
jack
thought
we
could
not
do
this
without
a
church
and
a
priest
but
ernest
believed
that
god
would
hear
our
prayers
under
his
own
sky
and
papa
could
give
them
a
sermon
francis
wished
to
know
if
god
would
like
to
hear
them
sing
the
beautiful
hymns
mamma
had
taught
them
without
an
organ
accompaniment
yes
my
dear
children
said
i
god
is
everywhere
and
to
bless
him
to
praise
him
in
all
his
works
to
submit
to
his
holy
will
and
to
obey
him
is
to
serve
him
but
everything
in
its
time
let
us
first
attend
to
the
wants
of
our
animals
and
breakfast
and
we
will
then
begin
the
services
of
the
day
by
a
hymn
we
descended
and
breakfasted
on
warm
milk
fed
our
animals
and
then
my
children
and
their
mother
seated
on
the
turf
i
placed
myself
on
a
little
eminence
before
them
and
after
the
service
of
the
day
which
i
knew
by
heart
and
singing
some
portions
of
the
psalm
i
told
them
a
little
allegory
there
was
once
on
a
time
a
great
king
whose
kingdom
was
called
the
land
of
and
because
there
reigned
there
constant
light
and
incessant
activity
on
the
most
remote
frontier
of
this
kingdom
towards
the
north
there
was
another
large
kingdom
equally
subject
to
his
rule
and
of
which
none
but
himself
knew
the
immense
extent
from
time
immemorial
an
exact
plan
of
this
kingdom
had
been
preserved
in
the
archives
it
was
called
the
land
of
obscurity
or
because
everything
in
it
was
dark
and
inactive
in
the
most
fertile
and
agreeable
part
of
the
empire
of
reality
the
king
had
a
magnificent
residence
called
heavenly
where
he
held
his
brilliant
court
millions
of
servants
executed
his
wishes
still
more
were
ready
to
receive
his
orders
the
first
were
clothed
in
glittering
robes
whiter
than
snow
for
white
was
the
colour
of
the
great
king
as
the
emblem
of
purity
others
were
clothed
in
armour
shining
like
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
carried
flaming
swords
in
their
hands
each
at
his
master
nod
flew
like
lightning
to
accomplish
his
will
all
his
servants
faithful
vigilant
bold
and
ardent
were
united
in
friendship
and
could
imagine
no
happiness
greater
than
the
favour
of
their
master
there
were
some
less
elevated
who
were
still
good
rich
and
happy
in
the
favours
of
their
sovereign
to
whom
all
his
subjects
were
alike
and
were
treated
by
him
as
his
children
not
far
from
the
frontiers
the
great
king
possessed
a
desert
island
which
he
desired
to
people
and
cultivate
in
order
to
make
it
for
a
time
the
abode
of
those
of
his
subjects
whom
he
intended
to
admit
by
degrees
into
his
a
favour
he
wished
to
bestow
on
the
greatest
number
possible
this
island
was
called
and
he
who
had
passed
some
time
there
worthily
was
to
be
received
into
all
the
happiness
of
the
heavenly
city
to
attain
this
the
great
king
equipped
a
fleet
to
transport
the
colonists
whom
he
chose
from
the
kingdom
of
to
this
island
where
he
gave
them
light
and
activity
advantages
they
had
not
known
before
think
how
joyful
their
arrival
would
be
the
island
was
fertile
when
cultivated
and
all
was
prepared
to
make
the
time
pass
agreeably
till
they
were
admitted
to
their
highest
honours
at
the
moment
of
embarkation
the
great
king
sent
his
own
son
who
spoke
thus
to
them
in
his
name
dear
children
i
have
called
you
from
inaction
and
insensibility
to
render
you
happy
by
feeling
by
action
by
life
never
forget
i
am
your
king
and
obey
my
commands
by
cultivating
the
country
i
confide
to
you
every
one
will
receive
his
portion
of
land
and
wise
and
learned
men
are
appointed
to
explain
my
will
to
you
i
wish
you
all
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
my
laws
and
that
every
father
should
keep
a
copy
to
read
daily
to
his
children
that
they
may
never
be
forgotten
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
you
must
all
assemble
as
brothers
in
one
place
to
hear
these
laws
read
and
explained
thus
it
will
be
easy
for
every
one
to
learn
the
best
method
of
improving
his
land
what
to
plant
and
how
to
cleanse
it
from
the
tares
that
might
choke
the
good

all
may
ask
what
they
desire
and
every
reasonable
demand
will
be
granted
if
it
be
conformable
to
the
great
end
you
feel
grateful
for
these
benefits
and
testify
it
by
increased
activity
and
by
occupying
yourself
on
this
day
in
expressing
your
gratitude
to
me
i
will
take
care
this
day
of
rest
shall
be
a
benefit
and
not
a
loss
i
wish
that
all
your
useful
animals
and
even
the
wild
beasts
of
the
plains
should
on
this
day
repose
in
peace
who
obeys
my
commands
in
abode
shall
receive
a
rich
reward
in
the
city
but
the
idle
the
negligent
and
the
shall
be
condemned
to
perpetual
slavery
or
to
labour
in
mines
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
time
to
time
i
shall
send
ships
to
bring
away
individuals
to
be
rewarded
or
punished
as
they
have
fulfilled
my
commands
none
can
deceive
me
a
magic
mirror
will
show
me
the
actions
and
thoughts
of
all
the
colonists
were
satisfied
and
eager
to
begin
their
labour
the
portions
of
land
and
instruments
of
labour
were
distributed
to
them
with
seeds
and
useful
plants
and
they
were
then
left
to
turn
these
good
gifts
to
profit
but
what
followed
every
one
did
as
he
wished
some
planted
their
ground
with
groves
and
gardens
pretty
and
useless
others
planted
wild
fruit
instead
of
the
good
fruit
the
great
king
had
commanded
a
third
had
sowed
good
seed
but
not
knowing
the
tares
from
the
wheat
he
had
torn
up
all
before
they
reached
maturity
but
the
most
part
left
their
land
uncultivated
they
had
lost
their
seeds
or
spoiled
their
implements
many
would
not
understand
the
orders
of
the
great
king
and
others
tried
by
subtlety
to
evade
them
a
few
laboured
with
courage
as
they
had
been
taught
rejoicing
in
the
hope
of
the
promise
given
them
their
greatest
danger
was
in
the
disbelief
of
their
teachers
though
every
one
had
a
copy
of
the
law
few
read
it
all
were
ready
by
some
excuse
to
avoid
this
duty
some
asserted
they
knew
it
yet
never
thought
on
it
some
called
these
the
laws
of
past
times
not
of
the
present
other
said
the
great
king
did
not
regard
the
actions
of
his
subjects
that
he
had
neither
mines
nor
dungeons
and
that
all
would
certainly
be
taken
to
the
they
began
to
neglect
the
duties
of
the
day
dedicated
to
the
great
king
few
assembled
and
of
these
the
most
part
were
inattentive
and
did
not
profit
by
the
instruction
given
them
but
the
great
king
was
faithful
to
his
word
from
time
to
time
frigates
arrived
bearing
the
name
of
some
disease
these
were
followed
by
a
large
vessel
called
bearing
the
terrible
flag
of
the
admiral
this
flag
was
of
two
colours
green
and
black
and
appeared
to
the
colonists
according
to
their
state
the
smiling
colour
of
or
the
gloomy
hue
of
this
fleet
always
arrived
unexpectedly
and
was
usually
unwelcome
the
officers
were
sent
out
by
the
admiral
to
seize
those
he
pointed
out
many
who
were
unwilling
were
compelled
to
go
and
others
whose
land
was
prepared
and
even
the
harvest
ripening
were
summoned
but
these
went
joyfully
sure
that
they
went
to
happiness
the
fleet
being
ready
sailed
for
the
then
the
great
king
in
his
justice
awarded
the
punishments
and
recompenses
excuses
were
now
too
late
the
negligent
and
disobedient
were
sent
to
labour
in
the
dark
mines
while
the
faithful
and
obedient
arrayed
in
bright
robes
were
received
into
their
glorious
abodes
of
happiness
i
have
finished
my
parable
my
dear
children
reflect
on
it
and
profit
by
it
fritz
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
am
considering
the
goodness
of
the
great
king
and
the
ingratitude
of
his
people
answered
he
and
how
very
foolish
they
were
said
ernest
with
a
little
prudence
they
might
have
kept
their
land
in
good
condition
and
secured
a
pleasant
life
afterwards
away
with
them
to
the
mines
cried
jack
they
richly
deserved
such
a
doom
how
much
i
should
like
said
francis
to
see
those
soldiers
in
their
shining
armour
i
hope
you
will
see
them
some
day
my
dear
boy
if
you
continue
to
be
good
and
obedient
i
then
explained
my
parable
fully
and
applied
the
moral
to
each
of
my
sons
directly
you
fritz
should
take
warning
from
the
people
who
planted
wild
fruit
and
wished
to
make
them
pass
for
good
fruit
such
are
those
who
are
proud
of
natural
virtues
easy
to
exercise
such
as
bodily
strength
or
physical
courage
and
place
these
above
the
qualities
which
are
only
attained
by
labour
and
patience
you
ernest
must
remember
the
subjects
who
laid
out
their
land
in
flowery
gardens
like
those
who
seek
the
pleasures
of
life
rather
than
the
duties
and
you
my
thoughtless
jack
and
little
francis
think
of
the
fate
of
those
who
left
their
land
untilled
or
heedlessly
sowed
tares
for
wheat
these
are
god
people
who
neither
study
nor
reflect
who
cast
to
the
winds
all
instruction
and
leave
room
in
their
minds
for
evil
then
let
us
all
be
like
the
good
labourers
of
the
parable
constantly
cultivating
our
ground
that
when
death
comes
for
us
we
may
willingly
follow
him
to
the
feet
of
the
great
king
to
hear
these
blessed
words
and
faithful
servants
enter
into
the
joy
of
your
lord
this
made
a
great
impression
on
my
children
we
concluded
by
singing
a
hymn
then
my
good
wife
produced
from
her
unfailing
bag
a
copy
of
the
holy
scripture
from
which
i
selected
such
passages
as
applied
to
our
situation
and
explained
them
to
my
best
ability
my
boys
remained
for
some
time
thoughtful
and
serious
and
though
they
followed
their
innocent
recreations
during
the
day
they
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
useful
lesson
of
the
morning
but
by
a
more
gentle
and
amiable
manner
showed
that
my
words
had
taken
effect
the
next
morning
ernest
had
used
my
bow
which
i
had
given
him
very
skilfully
bringing
down
some
dozens
of
small
birds
a
sort
of
ortolan
from
the
branches
of
our
tree
where
they
assembled
to
feed
on
the
figs
this
induced
them
all
to
wish
for
such
a
weapon
i
was
glad
to
comply
with
their
wishes
as
i
wished
them
to
become
skilful
in
the
use
of
these
arms
of
our
forefathers
which
might
be
of
great
value
to
us
when
our
ammunition
failed
i
made
two
bows
and
two
quivers
to
contain
their
arrows
of
a
flexible
piece
of
bark
and
attaching
a
strap
to
them
i
soon
armed
my
little
archers
fritz
was
engaged
in
preparing
the
skin
of
the
margay
with
more
care
than
jack
had
shown
with
that
of
the
jackal
i
showed
him
how
to
clean
it
by
rubbing
it
with
sand
in
the
river
till
no
vestige
of
fat
or
flesh
was
left
and
then
applying
butter
to
render
it
flexible
these
employments
filled
up
the
morning
till
came
we
had
ernest
ortolans
and
some
fried
ham
and
eggs
which
made
us
a
sumptuous
repast
i
gave
my
boys
leave
to
kill
as
many
ortolans
as
they
chose
for
i
knew
that
and
put
into
casks
covered
with
butter
they
would
keep
for
a
length
of
time
and
prove
an
invaluable
resource
in
time
of
need
as
i
continued
my
work
making
arrows
and
a
bow
for
francis
i
intimated
to
my
wife
that
the
abundant
supply
of
figs
would
save
our
grain
as
the
poultry
and
pigeons
would
feed
on
them
as
well
as
the
ortolans
this
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
her
and
thus
another
day
passed
and
we
mounted
to
our
dormitory
to
taste
the
sweet
slumber
that
follows
a
day
of
toil
chapter
xiii
the
next
morning
all
were
engaged
in
archery
i
completed
the
bow
for
francis
and
at
his
particular
request
made
him
a
quiver
too
the
delicate
bark
of
a
tree
united
by
glue
obtained
from
our
portable
soup
formed
an
admirable
quiver
this
i
suspended
by
a
string
round
the
neck
of
my
boy
furnished
with
arrows
then
taking
his
bow
in
his
hand
he
was
as
proud
as
a
knight
armed
at
all
points
after
dinner
i
proposed
that
we
should
give
names
to
all
the
parts
of
our
island
known
to
us
in
order
that
by
a
pleasing
delusion
we
might
fancy
ourselves
in
an
inhabited
country
my
proposal
was
well
received
and
then
began
the
discussion
of
names
jack
wished
for
something
and
difficult
such
as
or
very
difficult
words
to
puzzle
any
one
that
visited
our
island
but
i
objected
to
this
as
were
the
most
likely
to
have
to
use
the
names
ourselves
and
we
should
suffer
from
it
i
rather
suggested
that
we
should
give
in
our
own
language
such
simple
names
as
should
point
out
some
circumstance
connected
with
the
spot
i
proposed
we
should
begin
with
the
bay
where
we
landed
and
called
on
fritz
for
his
name
bay
of
said
he
we
found
so
many
there
oh
no
said
jack
let
it
be
for
there
i
was
caught

the

then
we
ought
to
call
it
the
of
said
ernest
to
commemorate
those
you
shed
on
the
occasion
my
advice
said
my
wife
is
that
in
gratitude
to
god
we
should
name
it
we
were
all
pleased
with
this
name
and
proceeded
to
give
the
name
of
to
our
first
abode
to
the
little
island
in
the
bay
where
we
had
found
that
animal
and
at
jack
desire
the
marshy
spot
where
we
had
cut
our
arrows
was
named
there
the
height
from
which
we
had
vainly
sought
traces
of
our
shipmates
received
the
name
of
the
river
was
to
be
and
the
bridge
the
most
difficult
point
was
to
name
our
present
abode
at
last
we
agreed
on
the
name
of
in
german
this
was
received
with
acclamations
and
i
poured
out
for
my
young
nestlings
each
a
glass
of
sweet
wine
to
drink
prosperity
to
we
thus
laid
the
foundation
of
the
geography
of
our
new
country
promising
to
forward
it
to
europe
by
the
first
post
after
dinner
my
sons
returned
to
their
occupation
as
tanners
fritz
to
complete
his
belt
and
jack
to
make
a
sort
of
cuirass
of
the
formidable
skin
of
the
porcupine
to
protect
the
dogs
he
finished
by
making
a
sort
of
helmet
from
the
head
of
the
animal
as
strange
as
the
cuirasses
the
heat
of
the
day
being
over
we
prepared
to
set
out
to
walk
to
tent
house
to
renew
our
stock
of
provisions
and
endeavour
to
bring
the
geese
and
ducks
to
our
new
residence
but
instead
of
going
by
the
coast
we
proposed
to
go
up
the
river
till
we
reached
the
chain
of
rocks
and
continue
under
their
shade
till
we
got
to
the
cascade
where
we
could
cross
and
return
by
family
bridge
this
was
approved
and
we
set
out
fritz
decorated
with
his
beautiful
belt
of
skin
jack
in
his
porcupine
helmet
each
had
a
gun
and
except
francis
who
with
his
pretty
fair
face
his
golden
hair
and
his
bow
and
quiver
was
a
perfect
cupid
my
wife
was
loaded
with
a
large
for
a
fresh
supply
turk
walked
before
us
with
his
coat
of
mail
and
flora
followed
peeping
at
a
respectful
distance
from
him
for
fear
of
the
darts
as
my
boys
called
the
monkey
finding
this
new
saddle
very
inconvenient
jumped
off
with
many
contortions
but
soon
fixed
on
flora
who
not
being
able
to
shake
him
off
was
compelled
to
become
his
palfrey
the
road
by
the
river
was
smooth
and
pleasant
when
we
reached
the
end
of
the
wood
the
country
seemed
more
open
and
now
the
boys
who
had
been
rambling
about
came
running
up
out
of
breath
ernest
was
holding
a
plant
with
leaves
and
flowers
and
green
apples
hanging
on
it
potatoes
said
he
i
am
certain
they
are
potatoes
god
be
praised
said
i
this
precious
plant
will
secure
provision
for
our
colony
well
said
jack
if
his
superior
knowledge
discovered
them
i
will
be
the
first
to
dig
them
up
and
he
set
to
work
so
ardently
that
we
had
soon
a
bag
of
fine
ripe
potatoes
which
we
carried
on
to
tent
house
chapter
xiv
we
had
been
much
delighted
with
the
new
and
lovely
scenery
of
our
road
the
prickly
cactus
and
aloe
with
its
white
flowers
the
indian
fig
the
white
and
yellow
jasmine
the
fragrant
vanilla
throwing
round
its
graceful
festoons
above
all
the
regal
pineapple
grew
in
profusion
and
we
feasted
on
it
for
the
first
time
with
avidity
among
the
prickly
stalks
of
the
cactus
and
aloes
i
perceived
a
plant
with
large
pointed
leaves
which
i
knew
to
be
the
i
pointed
out
to
the
boys
its
beautiful
red
flowers
the
leaves
are
an
excellent
application
to
wounds
and
thread
is
made
from
the
filaments
and
the
pith
of
the
stem
is
used
by
the
savage
tribes
for
tinder
when
i
showed
the
boys
by
experiment
the
use
of
the
pith
they
thought
the
would
be
almost
as
useful
as
the
potatoes
at
all
events
i
said
it
will
be
more
useful
than
the
your
mother
will
be
thankful
for
thread
when
her
enchanted
bag
is
exhausted
how
happy
it
is
for
us
said
she
that
you
have
devoted
yourself
to
reading
and
study
in
our
ignorance
we
might
have
passed
this
treasure
without
suspecting
its
value
fritz
inquired
of
what
use
in
the
world
all
the
rest
of
these
prickly
plants
could
be
which
wounded
every
one
that
came
near
all
these
have
their
use
fritz
said
i
some
contain
juices
and
gums
which
are
daily
made
use
of
in
medicine
others
are
useful
in
the
arts
or
in
manufactures
the
indian
fig
for
instance
is
a
most
interesting
tree
it
grows
in
the
most
arid
soil
the
fruit
is
said
to
be
sweet
and
wholesome
in
a
moment
my
little
active
jack
was
climbing
the
rocks
to
gather
some
of
these
figs
but
he
had
not
remarked
that
they
were
covered
with
thousands
of
slender
thorns
finer
than
the
finest
needles
which
terribly
wounded
his
fingers
he
returned
weeping
bitterly
and
dancing
with
pain
having
rallied
him
a
little
for
his
greediness
i
extracted
the
thorns
and
then
showed
him
how
to
open
the
fruit
by
first
cutting
off
the
pointed
end
as
it
lay
on
the
ground
into
this
i
fixed
a
piece
of
stick
and
then
pared
it
with
my
knife
the
novelty
of
the
expedient
recommended
it
and
they
were
soon
all
engaged
eating
the
fruit
which
they
declared
was
very
good
in
the
mean
time
i
saw
ernest
examining
one
of
the
figs
very
attentively
oh
papa
said
he
what
a
singular
sight
the
fig
is
covered
with
a
small
red
insect
i
can
not
shake
them
off
can
they
be
the
i
recognized
at
once
the
precious
insect
of
which
i
explained
to
my
sons
the
nature
and
use
it
is
with
this
insect
said
i
that
the
beautiful
and
rich
scarlet
dye
is
made
it
is
found
in
america
and
the
europeans
give
its
weight
in
gold
for
it
thus
discoursing
on
the
wonders
of
nature
and
the
necessity
of
increasing
our
knowledge
by
observation
and
study
we
arrived
at
tent
house
and
found
it
in
the
same
state
as
we
left
it
we
all
began
to
collect
necessaries
fritz
loaded
himself
with
powder
and
shot
i
opened
the
and
my
wife
and
little
francis
filled
the
pot
ernest
and
jack
went
to
try
and
secure
the
geese
and
ducks
but
they
had
become
so
wild
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
if
ernest
had
not
thought
of
an
expedient
he
tied
pieces
of
cheese
for
bait
to
threads
which
he
floated
on
the
water
the
voracious
creatures
immediately
swallowed
the
cheese
and
were
drawn
out
by
the
thread
they
were
then
securely
tied
and
fastened
to
the
to
be
carried
home
on
our
backs
as
the
bait
could
not
be
recovered
the
boys
contented
themselves
with
cutting
off
the
string
close
to
the
beak
leaving
them
to
digest
the
rest
our
bags
were
already
loaded
with
potatoes
but
we
filled
up
the
spaces
between
them
with
salt
and
having
relieved
turk
of
his
armour
we
placed
the
heaviest
on
his
back
i
took
the
and
after
replacing
everything
and
closing
our
tent
we
resumed
our
march
with
our
ludicrous
incumbrances
the
geese
and
ducks
were
very
noisy
in
their
adieu
to
their
old
marsh
the
dogs
barked
and
we
all
laughed
so
excessively
that
we
forgot
our
burdens
till
we
sat
down
again
under
our
tree
my
wife
soon
had
her
pot
of
potatoes
on
the
fire
she
then
milked
the
cow
and
goat
while
i
set
the
fowls
at
liberty
on
the
banks
of
the
river
we
then
sat
down
to
a
smoking
dish
of
potatoes
a
jug
of
milk
and
butter
and
cheese
after
supper
we
had
prayers
thanking
god
especially
for
his
new
benefits
and
we
then
sought
our
repose
among
the
leaves
chapter
xv
i
had
observed
on
the
shore
the
preceding
day
a
quantity
of
wood
which
i
thought
would
suit
to
make
a
sledge
to
convey
our
casks
and
heavy
stores
from
tent
house
to
falcon
nest
at
dawn
of
day
i
woke
ernest
whose
inclination
to
indolence
i
wished
to
overcome
and
leaving
the
rest
asleep
we
descended
and
harnessing
the
ass
to
a
strong
branch
of
a
tree
that
was
lying
near
we
proceeded
to
the
shore
i
had
no
difficulty
in
selecting
proper
pieces
of
wood
we
sawed
them
the
right
length
tied
them
together
and
laid
them
across
the
bough
which
the
patient
animal
drew
very
contentedly
we
added
to
the
load
a
small
chest
we
discovered
half
buried
in
the
sand
and
we
returned
homewards
ernest
leading
the
ass
and
i
assisted
by
raising
the
load
with
a
lever
when
we
met
with
any
obstruction
my
wife
had
been
rather
alarmed
but
seeing
the
result
of
our
expedition
and
hearing
of
the
prospect
of
a
sledge
she
was
satisfied
i
opened
the
chest
which
contained
only
some
sailors
dresses
and
some
linen
both
wetted
with
but
likely
to
be
very
useful
as
our
own
clothes
decayed
i
found
fritz
and
jack
had
been
shooting
ortolans
they
had
killed
about
fifty
but
had
consumed
so
much
powder
and
shot
that
i
checked
a
prodigality
so
imprudent
in
our
situation
i
taught
them
to
make
snares
for
the
birds
of
the
threads
we
drew
from
the
karata
leaves
we
had
brought
home
my
wife
and
her
two
younger
sons
busied
themselves
with
these
while
i
with
my
two
elder
boys
began
to
construct
the
sledge
as
we
were
working
we
heard
a
great
noise
among
the
fowls
and
ernest
looking
about
discovered
the
monkey
seizing
and
hiding
the
eggs
from
the
nests
he
had
collected
a
good
store
in
a
hole
among
the
roots
which
ernest
carried
to
his
mother
and
knips
was
punished
by
being
tied
up
every
morning
till
the
eggs
were
collected
our
work
was
interrupted
by
dinner
composed
of
ortolans
milk
and
cheese
after
dinner
jack
had
climbed
to
the
higher
branches
of
the
trees
to
place
his
snares
and
found
the
pigeons
were
making
nests
i
then
told
him
to
look
often
to
the
snares
for
fear
our
own
poor
birds
should
be
taken
and
above
all
never
in
future
to
fire
into
the
tree
papa
said
little
francis
can
we
not
sow
some
gunpowder
and
then
we
shall
have
plenty
this
proposal
was
received
with
shouts
of
laughter
which
greatly
discomposed
the
little
innocent
fellow
professor
ernest
immediately
seized
the
opportunity
to
give
a
lecture
on
the
composition
of
gunpowder
at
the
end
of
the
day
my
sledge
was
finished
two
long
curved
planks
of
wood
crossed
by
three
pieces
at
a
distance
from
each
other
formed
the
simple
conveyance
the
fore
and
hind
parts
were
in
the
form
of
horns
to
keep
the
load
from
falling
off
two
ropes
were
fastened
to
the
front
and
my
sledge
was
complete
my
wife
was
delighted
with
it
and
hoped
i
would
now
set
out
immediately
to
tent
house
for
the
i
made
no
objection
to
this
and
ernest
and
i
prepared
to
go
and
leave
fritz
in
charge
of
the
family
chapter
xvi
when
we
were
ready
to
set
out
fritz
presented
each
of
us
with
a
little
case
he
had
made
from
the
skin
of
the
margay
they
were
ingeniously
contrived
to
contain
knife
fork
and
spoon
and
a
small
hatchet
we
then
harnessed
the
ass
and
the
cow
to
the
sledge
took
a
flexible
bamboo
cane
for
a
whip
and
followed
by
flora
we
departed
leaving
turk
to
guard
the
tree
we
went
by
the
shore
as
the
better
road
for
the
sledge
and
crossing
family
bridge
were
soon
at
tent
house
after
unharnessing
the
animals
we
began
to
load
we
took
the
cask
of
butter
the
cheese
and
the
biscuit
all
the
rest
of
our
utensils
powder
shot
and
turk
armour
which
we
had
left
there
these
labours
had
so
occupied
us
that
we
had
not
observed
that
our
animals
attracted
by
the
pasturage
had
crossed
the
bridge
and
wandered
out
of
sight
i
sent
ernest
to
seek
them
and
in
the
mean
time
went
to
the
bay
where
i
discovered
some
convenient
little
hollows
in
the
rock
that
seemed
cut
out
for
baths
i
called
ernest
to
come
and
till
he
arrived
employed
myself
in
cutting
some
rushes
which
i
thought
might
be
useful
when
my
son
came
i
found
he
had
ingeniously
removed
the
first
planks
from
the
bridge
to
prevent
the
animals
straying
over
again
we
then
had
a
very
pleasant
bath
and
ernest
being
out
first
i
sent
him
to
the
rock
where
the
salt
was
accumulated
to
fill
a
small
bag
to
be
transferred
to
the
large
bags
on
the
ass
he
had
not
been
absent
long
when
i
heard
him
cry
out
papa
papa
a
huge
fish
i
can
not
hold
it
it
will
break
my
line
i
ran
to
his
assistance
and
found
him
lying
on
the
ground
on
his
face
tugging
at
his
line
to
which
an
enormous
salmon
was
attached
that
had
nearly
pulled
him
into
the
water
i
let
it
have
a
little
more
line
then
drew
it
gently
into
a
shallow
and
secured
it
it
appeared
about
fifteen
pounds
weight
and
we
pleased
ourselves
with
the
idea
of
presenting
this
to
our
good
cook
ernest
said
he
remembered
having
remarked
how
this
place
swarmed
with
fish
and
he
took
care
to
bring
his
rod
with
him
he
had
taken
about
a
dozen
small
fishes
which
he
had
in
his
handkerchief
before
he
was
overpowered
by
the
salmon
i
cut
the
fishes
open
and
rubbed
the
inside
with
salt
to
preserve
them
then
placing
them
in
a
small
box
on
the
sledge
and
adding
our
bags
of
salt
we
harnessed
our
animals
and
set
off
homewards
when
we
were
about
flora
left
us
and
by
her
barking
raised
a
singular
animal
which
seemed
to
leap
instead
of
ran
the
irregular
bounds
of
the
animal
disconcerted
my
aim
and
though
very
near
i
missed
it
ernest
was
more
fortunate
he
fired
at
it
and
killed
it
it
was
an
animal
about
the
size
of
a
sheep
with
the
tail
of
a
tiger
its
head
and
skin
were
like
those
of
a
mouse
ears
longer
than
the
hare
there
was
a
curious
pouch
on
the
belly
the
fore
legs
were
short
as
if
imperfectly
developed
and
armed
with
strong
claws
the
hind
legs
long
like
a
pair
of
stilts
after
ernest
pride
of
victory
was
a
little
subdued
he
fell
back
on
his
science
and
began
to
examine
his
spoil
by
its
teeth
said
he
it
should
belong
to
the
family
of
or
gnawers
by
its
legs
to
the
and
by
its
pouch
to
the
opossum
tribe
this
gave
me
the
right
clue
then
said
i
this
must
be
the
animal
cook
first
discovered
in
new
holland
and
it
is
called
the
we
now
tied
the
legs
of
the
animal
together
and
putting
a
stick
through
carried
it
to
the
sledge
very
carefully
for
ernest
was
anxious
to
preserve
the
beautiful
skin
our
animals
were
heavily
laden
but
giving
them
a
little
rest
and
some
fresh
grass
we
once
more
started
and
in
a
short
time
reached
falcon
nest
my
wife
had
been
employed
during
our
absence
in
washing
the
clothes
of
the
three
boys
clothing
them
in
the
mean
time
from
the
sailor
chest
we
had
found
a
few
days
before
their
appearance
was
excessively
ridiculous
as
the
garments
neither
suited
their
age
nor
size
and
caused
great
mirth
to
us
all
but
my
wife
had
preferred
this
disguise
to
the
alternative
of
their
going
naked
we
now
began
to
display
our
riches
and
relate
our
adventures
the
butter
and
the
rest
of
the
provisions
were
very
welcome
the
salmon
still
more
so
but
the
sight
of
the
kangaroo
produced
screams
of
admiration
fritz
displayed
a
little
jealousy
but
soon
surmounted
it
by
an
exertion
of
his
nobler
feelings
and
only
the
keen
eye
of
a
father
could
have
discovered
it
he
congratulated
ernest
warmly
but
could
not
help
begging
to
accompany
me
next
time
i
promise
you
that
said
i
as
a
reward
for
the
conquest
you
have
achieved
over
your
jealousy
of
your
brother
but
remember
i
could
not
have
given
you
a
greater
proof
of
my
confidence
than
in
leaving
you
to
protect
your
mother
and
brothers
a
noble
mind
finds
its
purest
joy
in
the
accomplishment
of
its
duty
and
to
that
willingly
sacrifices
its
inclination
but
i
added
in
a
low
tone
lest
i
should
distress
my
wife
i
propose
another
expedition
to
the
vessel
and
you
must
accompany
me
we
then
fed
our
tired
animals
giving
them
some
salt
with
their
grass
a
great
treat
to
them
some
salmon
was
prepared
for
dinner
and
the
rest
salted
after
dinner
i
hung
up
the
kangaroo
till
next
day
when
we
intended
to
salt
and
smoke
the
flesh
evening
arrived
and
an
excellent
supper
of
fish
ortolans
and
potatoes
refreshed
us
and
after
thanks
to
god
we
retired
to
rest
chapter
xvii
i
rose
early
and
descended
the
ladder
a
little
uneasy
about
my
kangaroo
and
found
i
was
but
just
in
time
to
save
it
for
my
dogs
had
so
enjoyed
their
repast
on
the
entrails
which
i
had
given
them
the
night
before
that
they
wished
to
appropriate
the
rest
they
had
succeeded
in
tearing
off
the
head
which
was
in
their
reach
and
were
devouring
it
in
a
sort
of
growling
partnership
as
we
had
no
for
our
provision
i
decided
to
administer
a
little
correction
as
a
warning
to
these
gluttons
i
gave
them
some
smart
strokes
with
a
cane
and
they
fled
howling
to
the
stable
under
the
roots
their
cries
roused
my
wife
who
came
down
and
though
she
could
not
but
allow
the
chastisement
to
be
just
and
prudent
she
was
so
moved
by
compassion
that
she
consoled
the
poor
sufferers
with
some
remains
of
last
night
supper
i
now
carefully
stripped
the
kangaroo
of
his
elegant
skin
and
washing
myself
and
changing
my
dress
after
this
unpleasant
operation
i
joined
my
family
at
breakfast
i
then
announced
my
plan
of
visiting
the
vessel
and
ordered
fritz
to
make
preparations
my
wife
resigned
herself
mournfully
to
the
necessity
when
we
were
ready
to
depart
ernest
and
jack
were
not
to
be
found
their
mother
suspected
they
had
gone
to
get
potatoes
this
calmed
my
apprehension
but
i
charged
her
to
reprimand
them
for
going
without
leave
we
set
out
towards
tent
house
leaving
flora
to
protect
the
household
and
taking
our
guns
as
usual
we
had
scarcely
left
the
wood
and
were
approaching
jackal
river
when
we
heard
piercing
cries
and
suddenly
ernest
and
jack
leaped
from
a
thicket
delighted
as
jack
said
in
having
succeeded
in
their
plan
of
accompanying
us
and
moreover
in
making
us
believe
we
were
beset
with
savages
they
were
however
disappointed
i
gave
them
a
severe
reproof
for
their
disobedience
and
sent
them
home
with
a
message
to
their
mother
that
i
thought
we
might
be
detained
all
night
and
begged
she
would
not
be
uneasy
they
listened
to
me
in
great
confusion
and
were
much
mortified
at
their
dismissal
but
i
begged
fritz
to
give
ernest
his
silver
watch
that
they
might
know
how
the
time
passed
and
i
knew
that
i
could
replace
it
as
there
was
a
case
of
watches
in
the
ship
this
reconciled
them
a
little
to
their
lot
and
they
left
us
we
went
forward
to
our
boat
embarked
and
aided
by
the
current
soon
reached
the
vessel
my
first
care
was
to
construct
some
more
convenient
than
our
boat
fritz
proposed
a
raft
similar
to
those
used
by
savage
nations
supported
on
skins
filled
with
air
these
we
had
not
but
we
found
a
number
of
which
we
emptied
and
closed
again
and
threw
a
dozen
of
them
into
the
sea
between
the
ship
and
our
boat
some
long
planks
were
laid
on
these
and
secured
with
ropes
we
added
a
raised
edge
of
planks
to
secure
our
cargo
and
thus
had
a
solid
raft
capable
of
conveying
any
burden
this
work
occupied
us
the
whole
day
scarcely
interrupted
by
eating
a
little
cold
meat
from
our
exhausted
by
fatigue
we
were
glad
to
take
a
good
night
rest
in
the
captain
cabin
on
an
elastic
mattress
of
which
our
hammocks
had
made
us
forget
the
comfort
early
next
morning
we
began
to
load
our
raft
we
began
by
entirely
stripping
our
own
cabin
and
that
of
the
captain
we
carried
away
even
the
doors
and
windows
the
chests
of
the
carpenter
and
the
gunner
followed
there
were
cases
of
rich
jewellery
and
caskets
of
money
which
at
first
tempted
us
but
were
speedily
relinquished
for
objects
of
real
utility
i
preferred
a
case
of
young
plants
of
european
fruits
carefully
packed
in
moss
for
transportation
i
saw
with
delight
among
these
precious
plants
apple
pear
plum
orange
apricot
peach
almond
and
chesnut
trees
and
some
young
shoots
of
vines
how
i
longed
to
plant
these
familiar
trees
of
home
in
a
foreign
soil
we
secured
some
bars
of
iron
and
pigs
of
lead
grindstones
ready
for
mounting
tongs
shovels
packets
of
copper
and
iron
wire
sacks
of
maize
peas
oats
and
vetches
and
even
a
small
the
vessel
had
been
in
fact
laden
with
everything
likely
to
be
useful
in
a
new
colony
we
found
a
in
pieces
but
marked
so
that
it
could
be
easily
put
together
it
was
difficult
to
select
but
we
took
as
much
as
was
safe
on
the
raft
adding
a
large
and
the
ship
compass
fritz
begged
to
take
the
harpoons
which
he
hung
by
the
ropes
over
the
bow
of
our
boat
and
i
indulged
his
fancy
we
were
now
loaded
as
far
as
prudence
would
allow
us
so
attaching
our
raft
firmly
to
the
boat
we
hoisted
our
sail
and
made
slowly
to
the
shore
chapter
xviii
the
wind
was
favourable
but
we
advanced
slowly
the
floating
mass
that
we
had
to
tug
retarding
us
fritz
had
been
some
time
regarding
a
large
object
in
the
water
he
called
me
to
steer
a
little
towards
it
that
he
might
see
what
it
was
i
went
to
the
rudder
and
made
the
movement
immediately
i
heard
the
whistling
of
the
cord
and
felt
a
shock
then
a
second
which
was
followed
by
a
rapid
motion
of
the
boat
we
are
going
to
founder
cried
i
what
is
the
matter
i
have
caught
it
shouted
fritz
i
have
harpooned
it
in
the
neck
it
is
a
turtle
i
saw
the
harpoon
shining
at
a
distance
and
the
turtle
was
rapidly
drawing
us
along
by
the
line
i
lowered
the
sail
and
rushed
forward
to
cut
the
line
but
fritz
besought
me
not
to
do
it
he
assured
me
there
was
no
danger
and
that
he
himself
would
release
us
if
necessary
i
reluctantly
consented
and
saw
our
whole
convoy
drawn
by
an
animal
whose
agony
increased
its
strength
as
we
drew
near
the
shore
i
endeavoured
to
steer
so
that
we
might
not
strike
and
be
capsized
i
saw
after
a
few
minutes
that
our
conductor
again
wanted
to
make
out
to
sea
i
therefore
hoisted
the
sail
and
the
wind
being
in
our
favour
he
found
resistance
vain
and
tugging
as
before
followed
up
the
current
only
taking
more
to
the
left
towards
falcon
nest
and
landing
us
in
a
shallow
rested
on
the
shore
i
leaped
out
of
the
boat
and
with
a
hatchet
soon
put
our
powerful
conductor
out
of
his
misery
fritz
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
and
fired
off
his
gun
as
a
signal
of
our
arrival
all
came
running
to
greet
us
and
great
was
their
surprise
not
only
at
the
value
of
our
cargo
but
at
the
strange
mode
by
which
it
had
been
brought
into
harbour
my
first
care
was
to
send
them
for
the
sledge
to
remove
some
of
our
load
without
delay
and
as
the
ebbing
tide
was
leaving
our
vessels
almost
dry
on
the
sand
i
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
secure
them
by
the
aid
of
the
and
levers
we
raised
and
brought
to
the
shore
two
large
pieces
of
lead
from
the
raft
these
served
for
anchors
and
connected
to
the
boat
and
raft
by
strong
cables
fixed
them
safely
as
soon
as
the
sledge
arrived
we
placed
the
turtle
with
some
difficulty
on
it
as
it
weighed
at
least
three
hundredweight
we
added
some
lighter
articles
the
mattresses
some
small
chests
and
proceeded
with
our
first
load
to
falcon
nest
in
great
spirits
as
we
walked
on
fritz
told
them
of
the
wondrous
cases
of
jewellery
we
had
abandoned
for
things
of
use
jack
wished
fritz
had
brought
him
a
gold
to
hold
curious
seeds
and
francis
wished
for
some
of
the
money
to
buy
gingerbread
at
the
fair
everybody
laughed
at
the
little
simpleton
who
could
not
help
laughing
himself
when
he
remembered
his
distance
from
fairs
arrived
at
home
our
first
care
was
to
turn
the
turtle
on
his
back
to
get
the
excellent
meat
out
of
the
shell
with
my
hatchet
i
separated
the
cartilages
that
unite
the
shells
the
upper
shell
is
convex
the
lower
one
nearly
flat
we
had
some
of
the
turtle
prepared
for
dinner
though
my
wife
felt
great
repugnance
in
touching
the
green
fat
notwithstanding
my
assurance
of
its
being
the
chief
delicacy
to
an
epicure
we
salted
the
remainder
of
the
flesh
and
gave
the
offal
to
the
dogs
the
boys
were
all
clamorous
to
possess
the
shell
but
i
said
it
belonged
to
fritz
by
right
of
conquest
and
he
must
dispose
of
it
as
he
thought
best
then
said
he
i
will
make
a
basin
of
it
and
place
it
near
the
river
that
my
mother
may
always
keep
it
full
of
fresh
water
very
good
said
i
and
we
will
fill
our
basin
as
soon
as
we
find
some
clay
to
make
a
solid
foundation
i
found
some
this
morning
said
jack
a
whole
bed
of
clay
and
i
brought
these
balls
home
to
show
you
and
i
have
made
a
discovery
too
said
ernest
look
at
these
roots
like
radishes
i
have
not
eaten
any
but
the
sow
enjoys
them
very
much
a
most
valuable
discovery
indeed
said
i
if
i
am
not
mistaken
this
is
the
root
of
the
which
with
the
potatoes
will
insure
us
from
famine
of
this
root
they
make
in
the
west
indies
a
sort
of
bread
called
cassava
bread
in
its
natural
state
it
contains
a
violent
poison
but
by
a
process
of
heating
it
becomes
wholesome
the
nutritious
tapioca
is
a
preparation
from
this
root
by
this
time
we
had
unloaded
and
proceeded
to
the
shore
to
bring
a
second
load
before
night
came
on
we
brought
up
two
chests
of
our
own
clothes
and
property
some
chests
of
tools
the
and
the
likely
now
to
be
of
use
for
the
cassava
after
unloading
we
sat
down
to
an
excellent
supper
of
turtle
with
potatoes
instead
of
bread
after
supper
my
wife
said
smiling
after
such
a
hard
day
i
think
i
can
give
you
something
to
restore
you
she
then
brought
a
bottle
and
glasses
and
filled
us
each
a
glass
of
clear
wine
i
found
it
excellent
malaga
she
had
been
down
to
the
shore
the
previous
day
and
there
found
a
small
cask
thrown
up
by
the
waves
this
with
the
assistance
of
her
sons
she
had
rolled
up
to
the
foot
of
our
tree
and
there
covered
it
with
leaves
to
keep
it
cool
till
our
arrival
we
were
so
invigorated
by
this
cordial
that
we
set
briskly
to
work
to
hoist
up
our
mattresses
to
our
dormitory
which
we
accomplished
by
the
aid
of
ropes
and
pulleys
my
wife
received
and
arranged
them
and
after
our
usual
evening
devotions
we
gladly
lay
down
on
them
to
enjoy
a
night
of
sweet
repose
chapter
xix
i
rose
before
daylight
and
leaving
my
family
sleeping
descended
to
go
to
the
shore
to
look
after
my
vessels
i
found
all
the
animals
moving
the
dogs
leaped
about
me
the
cocks
were
crowing
the
goats
browsing
on
the
dewy
grass
the
ass
alone
was
sleeping
and
as
he
was
the
assistant
i
wanted
i
was
compelled
to
rouse
him
a
preference
which
did
not
appear
to
flatter
him
nevertheless
i
harnessed
him
to
the
sledge
and
followed
by
the
dogs
went
forward
to
the
coast
where
i
found
my
boat
and
raft
safe
at
anchor
i
took
up
a
moderate
load
and
came
home
to
breakfast
but
found
all
still
as
i
left
them
i
called
my
family
and
they
sprung
up
ashamed
of
their
sloth
my
wife
declared
it
must
have
been
the
good
mattress
that
had
charmed
her
i
gave
my
boys
a
short
admonition
for
their
sloth
we
then
came
down
to
a
hasty
breakfast
and
returned
to
the
coast
to
finish
the
unloading
the
boats
that
i
might
at
high
water
take
them
round
to
moor
at
the
usual
place
in
the
bay
of
safety
i
sent
my
wife
up
with
the
last
load
while
fritz
and
i
embarked
and
seeing
jack
watching
us
i
consented
that
he
should
form
one
of
the
crew
for
i
had
determined
to
make
another
visit
to
the
wreck
before
i
moored
my
craft
when
we
reached
the
vessel
the
day
was
so
far
advanced
that
we
had
only
time
to
collect
hastily
anything
easy
to
embark
my
sons
ran
over
the
ship
jack
came
trundling
a
wheelbarrow
which
he
said
would
be
excellent
for
fetching
the
potatoes
in
but
fritz
brought
me
good
news
he
had
found
between
decks
a
beautiful
pinnace
a
small
vessel
of
which
the
prow
is
square
taken
to
pieces
with
all
its
fittings
and
even
two
small
guns
i
saw
that
all
the
pieces
were
numbered
and
placed
in
order
nothing
was
wanting
i
felt
the
importance
of
this
acquisition
but
it
would
take
days
of
labour
to
put
it
together
and
then
how
could
we
launch
it
at
present
i
felt
i
must
renounce
the
undertaking
i
returned
to
my
loading
it
consisted
of
all
sorts
of
utensils
a
copper
boiler
some
plates
of
iron
two
grindstones
a
barrel
of
powder
and
one
of
flints
jack
did
not
forget
his
wheelbarrow
and
we
found
two
more
which
we
added
to
our
cargo
and
then
sailed
off
speedily
to
avoid
the
which
rises
in
the
evening
as
we
drew
near
we
were
astonished
to
see
a
row
of
little
creatures
standing
on
the
shore
apparently
regarding
us
with
much
curiosity
they
were
dressed
in
black
with
white
waistcoats
and
thick
cravats
their
arms
hung
down
carelessly
but
from
time
to
time
they
raised
them
as
if
they
wished
to
bestow
on
us
a
fraternal
embrace
i
believe
said
i
laughing
this
must
be
the
country
of
pigmies
and
they
are
coming
to
welcome
us
they
are
the
lilliputians
father
said
jack
i
have
read
of
them
but
i
thought
they
had
been
less
as
if
gulliver
travels
was
true
said
fritz
in
a
tone
of
derision
then
are
there
no
pigmies
asked
he
no
my
dear
boy
said
i
all
these
stories
are
either
the
invention
or
the
mistakes
of
ancient
navigators
who
have
taken
troops
of
monkeys
for
men
or
who
have
wished
to
repeat
something
marvellous
but
the
romance
of
gulliver
is
an
allegory
intended
to
convey
great
truths
and
now
said
fritz
i
begin
to
see
our
pigmies
have
beaks
and
wings
you
are
right
said
i
they
are
penguins
as
ernest
explained
to
us
some
time
since
they
are
good
swimmers
but
unable
to
fly
are
very
helpless
on
land
i
steered
gently
to
the
shore
that
i
might
not
disturb
them
but
jack
leaped
into
the
water
up
to
his
knees
and
dashing
among
the
penguins
with
a
stick
struck
right
and
left
knocking
down
half
a
dozen
of
the
poor
stupid
birds
before
they
were
aware
some
of
these
we
brought
away
alive
the
rest
not
liking
such
a
reception
took
to
the
water
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
i
scolded
jack
for
his
useless
rashness
for
the
flesh
of
the
penguin
is
by
no
means
a
delicacy
we
now
filled
our
three
wheelbarrows
with
such
things
as
we
could
carry
not
forgetting
the
sheets
of
iron
and
the
graters
and
trudged
home
our
dogs
announced
our
approach
and
all
rushed
out
to
meet
us
a
curious
and
merry
examination
commenced
they
laughed
at
my
graters
but
i
let
them
laugh
for
i
had
a
project
in
my
head
the
penguins
i
intended
for
our
and
for
the
present
i
ordered
the
boys
to
tie
each
of
them
by
a
leg
to
one
of
our
geese
or
ducks
who
opposed
the
bondage
very
clamorously
but
necessity
made
them
submissive
my
wife
showed
me
a
large
store
of
potatoes
and
manioc
roots
which
she
and
her
children
had
dug
up
the
evening
before
we
then
went
to
supper
and
talked
of
all
we
had
seen
in
the
vessel
especially
of
the
pinnace
which
we
had
been
obliged
to
leave
my
wife
did
not
feel
much
regret
on
this
account
as
she
dreaded
maritime
expeditions
though
she
agreed
she
might
have
felt
less
uneasiness
if
we
had
had
a
vessel
of
this
description
i
gave
my
sons
a
charge
to
rise
early
next
morning
as
we
had
an
important
business
on
hand
and
curiosity
roused
them
all
in
very
good
time
after
our
usual
preparations
for
the
day
i
addressed
them
thus
gentlemen
i
am
going
to
teach
you
all
a
new
business
that
of
a
baker
give
me
the
plates
of
iron
and
the
graters
we
brought
yesterday
my
wife
was
astonished
but
i
requested
her
to
wait
patiently
and
she
should
have
bread
not
perhaps
light
buns
but
eatable
flat
cakes
but
first
she
was
to
make
me
two
small
bags
of
sailcloth
she
obeyed
me
but
at
the
same
time
i
observed
she
put
the
potatoes
on
the
fire
a
proof
she
had
not
much
faith
in
my
i
then
spread
a
cloth
over
the
ground
and
giving
each
of
the
boys
a
grater
we
began
to
grate
the
manioc
roots
resting
the
end
on
the
cloth
in
a
short
time
we
had
a
heap
of
what
appeared
to
be
moist
white
sawdust
certainly
not
tempting
to
the
appetite
but
the
little
workmen
were
amused
with
their
labour
and
jested
no
little
about
the
cakes
made
of
scraped
radishes
laugh
now
boys
said
i
we
shall
see
after
a
while
but
you
ernest
ought
to
know
that
the
manioc
is
one
of
the
most
precious
of
alimentary
roots
forming
the
principal
sustenance
of
many
nations
of
america
and
often
preferred
by
europeans
who
inhabit
those
countries
to
wheaten
bread
when
all
the
roots
were
grated
i
filled
the
two
bags
closely
with
the
pollard
and
my
wife
sewed
the
ends
up
firmly
it
was
now
necessary
to
apply
strong
pressure
to
extract
the
juice
from
the
root
as
this
juice
is
a
deadly
poison
i
selected
an
oak
beam
one
end
of
which
we
fixed
between
the
roots
of
our
tree
beneath
this
i
placed
our
bags
on
a
row
of
little
blocks
of
wood
i
then
took
a
large
bough
which
i
had
cut
from
a
tree
and
prepared
for
the
purpose
and
laid
it
across
them
we
all
united
then
in
drawing
down
the
opposite
end
of
the
plank
over
the
bough
till
we
got
it
to
a
certain
point
when
we
suspended
to
it
the
heaviest
substances
we
possessed
hammers
bars
of
iron
and
masses
of
lead
this
acting
upon
the
manioc
the
sap
burst
through
the
cloth
and
flowed
on
the
ground
copiously
when
i
thought
the
pressure
was
complete
we
relieved
the
bags
from
the
lever
and
opening
one
drew
out
a
handful
of
the
pollard
still
rather
moist
resembling
coarse
it
only
wants
a
little
heat
to
complete
our
success
said
i
in
great
delight
i
ordered
a
fire
to
be
lighted
and
fixing
one
of
our
iron
plates
which
was
round
in
form
and
rather
concave
on
two
stones
placed
on
each
side
of
the
fire
i
covered
it
with
the
flour
which
we
took
from
the
bag
with
a
small
wooden
shovel
it
soon
formed
a
solid
cake
which
we
turned
that
it
might
be
equally
baked
it
smelled
so
good
that
they
all
wished
to
commence
eating
immediately
and
i
had
some
difficulty
in
convincing
them
that
this
was
only
a
trial
and
that
our
baking
was
still
imperfect
besides
as
i
told
them
there
were
three
kinds
of
manioc
of
which
one
contained
more
poison
than
the
rest
i
thought
it
prudent
to
try
whether
we
had
perfectly
extracted
it
by
giving
a
small
quantity
to
our
fowls
as
soon
therefore
as
the
cake
was
cold
i
gave
some
to
two
chickens
which
i
kept
apart
and
also
some
to
master
knips
the
monkey
that
he
might
for
the
first
time
do
us
a
little
service
he
ate
it
with
so
much
relish
and
such
grimaces
of
enjoyment
that
my
young
party
were
quite
anxious
to
share
his
feast
but
i
ordered
them
to
wait
till
we
could
judge
of
the
effect
and
leaving
our
employment
we
went
to
our
dinner
of
potatoes
to
which
my
wife
had
added
one
of
the
penguins
which
was
truly
rather
tough
and
fishy
but
as
jack
would
not
allow
this
and
declared
it
was
a
dish
fit
for
a
king
we
allowed
him
to
regale
on
it
as
much
as
he
liked
during
dinner
i
talked
to
them
of
the
various
preparations
made
from
the
manioc
i
told
my
wife
we
could
obtain
an
excellent
starch
from
the
expressed
juice
but
this
did
not
interest
her
much
as
at
present
she
usually
wore
the
dress
of
a
sailor
for
convenience
and
had
neither
caps
nor
collars
to
starch
the
cake
made
from
the
root
is
called
by
the
natives
of
the
antilles
and
in
no
savage
nation
do
we
find
any
word
signifying
an
article
of
food
unknown
to
them
we
spoke
of
poisons
and
i
explained
to
my
sons
the
different
nature
and
effects
of
them
especially
i
warned
them
against
the
which
ought
to
grow
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
described
the
fruit
to
them
as
resembling
a
tempting
yellow
apple
with
red
spots
which
is
one
of
the
most
deadly
poisons
it
is
said
that
even
to
sleep
under
the
tree
is
dangerous
i
forbade
them
to
taste
any
unknown
fruit
and
they
promised
to
obey
me
on
leaving
the
table
we
went
to
visit
the
victims
of
our
experiment
jack
whistled
for
knips
who
came
in
three
bounds
from
the
summit
of
a
high
tree
where
he
had
doubtless
been
plundering
some
nest
and
his
vivacity
and
the
peaceful
cackling
of
the
fowls
assured
us
our
preparation
was
harmless
now
gentlemen
said
i
laughing
to
the
bakehouse
and
let
us
see
what
we
can
do
i
wished
them
each
to
try
to
make
the
cakes
they
immediately
kindled
the
fire
and
heated
the
iron
plate
in
the
mean
time
i
broke
up
the
grated
cassava
and
mixed
it
with
a
little
milk
and
giving
each
of
them
a
basin
filled
with
the
paste
i
showed
them
how
to
pour
it
with
a
spoon
upon
the
plate
and
spread
it
about
when
the
paste
began
to
puff
up
i
judged
it
was
baked
on
one
side
and
turned
it
like
a
pancake
with
a
fork
and
after
a
little
time
we
had
a
quantity
of
nice
yellow
biscuits
which
with
a
jug
of
milk
made
us
a
delicious
collation
and
determined
us
without
delay
to
set
about
cultivating
the
manioc
the
rest
of
the
day
was
employed
in
bringing
up
the
remainder
of
our
cargo
by
means
of
the
sledge
and
the
useful
wheelbarrows
chapter
xx
the
next
morning
i
decided
on
returning
to
the
wreck
the
idea
of
the
pinnace
continually
haunted
my
mind
and
left
me
no
repose
but
it
was
necessary
to
take
all
the
hands
i
could
raise
and
with
difficulty
i
got
my
wife
consent
to
take
my
three
elder
sons
on
promising
her
we
would
return
in
the
evening
we
set
out
taking
provision
for
the
day
and
soon
arrived
at
the
vessel
when
my
boys
began
to
load
the
raft
with
all
manner
of
portable
things
but
the
great
matter
was
the
pinnace
it
was
contained
in
the
of
the
vessel
immediately
below
the
officers
berths
my
sons
with
all
the
ardour
of
their
age
begged
to
begin
by
clearing
a
space
in
the
vessel
to
put
the
pinnace
together
and
we
might
afterwards
think
how
we
should
launch
it
under
any
other
circumstances
i
should
have
shown
them
the
folly
of
such
an
undertaking
but
in
truth
i
had
myself
a
vague
hope
of
success
that
encouraged
me
and
i
cried
out
to
work
to
work
the
hold
was
lighted
by
some
chinks
in
the
ship
side
we
set
diligently
to
work
hacking
cutting
and
sawing
away
all
obstacles
and
before
evening
we
had
a
clear
space
round
us
but
now
it
was
necessary
to
return
and
we
put
to
sea
with
our
cargo
purposing
to
continue
our
work
daily
on
reaching
the
bay
of
safety
we
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
my
wife
and
francis
who
had
established
themselves
at
tent
house
intending
to
continue
there
till
our
visits
to
the
vessel
were
concluded
that
they
might
always
keep
us
in
sight
and
spare
us
the
unnecessary
labour
of
a
walk
after
our
day
work
i
thanked
my
wife
tenderly
for
this
kind
sacrifice
for
i
knew
how
much
she
enjoyed
the
cool
shade
of
falcon
nest
and
in
return
i
showed
her
the
treasures
we
had
brought
her
from
the
vessel
consisting
of
two
barrels
of
salt
butter
three
hogsheads
of
flour
several
bags
of
millet
rice
and
other
grains
and
a
variety
of
useful
household
articles
which
she
conveyed
with
great
delight
to
our
storehouse
in
the
rocks
for
a
week
we
spent
every
day
in
the
vessel
returning
in
the
evening
to
enjoy
a
good
supper
and
talk
of
our
progress
and
my
wife
happily
engrossed
with
her
poultry
and
other
household
cares
got
accustomed
to
our
absence
with
much
hard
labour
the
pinnace
was
at
last
put
together
its
construction
was
light
and
elegant
it
looked
as
if
it
would
sail
well
at
the
head
was
a
short
the
masts
and
sails
were
like
those
of
a
brigantine
we
carefully
caulked
all
the
seams
with
tow
dipped
in
melted
tar
and
we
even
indulged
ourselves
by
placing
the
two
small
guns
in
it
fastened
by
chains
and
there
stood
the
beautiful
little
bark
immovable
on
the
stocks
we
admired
it
incessantly
but
what
could
we
do
to
get
it
afloat
the
difficulty
of
forcing
a
way
through
the
mighty
timbers
lined
with
copper
that
formed
the
side
of
the
ship
was
insurmountable
suddenly
suggested
by
the
excess
of
my
despair
a
bold
but
dangerous
idea
presented
itself
to
me
in
which
all
might
be
lost
as
well
as
all
gained
i
said
nothing
about
this
to
my
children
to
avoid
the
vexation
of
a
possible
disappointment
but
began
to
execute
my
plan
i
found
a
mortar
exactly
fitted
for
my
purpose
which
i
filled
with
gunpowder
i
then
took
a
strong
oak
plank
to
cover
it
to
which
i
fixed
iron
hooks
so
that
they
could
reach
the
handles
of
the
mortar
i
cut
a
groove
in
the
side
of
the
plank
that
i
might
introduce
a
long
match
which
should
burn
at
least
two
hours
before
it
reached
the
powder
i
placed
the
plank
then
over
the
mortar
fastened
the
hooks
through
the
handles
surrounded
it
with
pitch
and
then
bound
some
strong
chains
round
the
whole
to
give
it
greater
solidity
i
proceeded
to
suspend
this
infernal
machine
against
the
side
of
the
ship
near
our
work
taking
care
to
place
it
where
the
recoil
from
the
explosion
should
not
injure
the
pinnace
when
all
was
ready
i
gave
the
signal
of
departure
my
sons
having
been
employed
in
the
boat
and
not
observing
my
preparations
i
remained
a
moment
to
fire
the
match
and
then
hastily
joined
them
with
a
beating
heart
and
proceeded
to
the
shore
as
soon
as
we
reached
our
harbour
i
detached
the
raft
that
i
might
return
in
the
boat
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
explosion
we
began
actively
to
unload
the
boat
and
while
thus
employed
a
report
like
thunder
was
heard
all
trembled
and
threw
down
their
load
in
terror
what
can
it
be
cried
they
perhaps
a
signal
from
some
vessel
in
distress
let
us
go
to
their
assistance
it
came
from
the
vessel
said
my
wife
it
must
have
blown
up
you
have
not
been
careful
of
fire
and
have
left
some
near
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
at
all
events
said
i
we
will
go
and
ascertain
the
cause
who
go
with
me
by
way
of
reply
my
three
sons
leaped
into
the
boat
and
consoling
the
anxious
mother
by
a
promise
to
return
immediately
away
we
rowed
we
never
made
the
voyage
so
quickly
curiosity
quickened
the
movements
of
my
sons
and
i
was
all
impatience
to
see
the
result
of
my
project
as
we
approached
i
was
glad
to
see
no
appearance
of
flames
or
even
smoke
the
position
of
the
vessel
did
not
seem
altered
instead
of
entering
the
vessel
as
usual
we
rounded
the
prow
and
came
opposite
the
other
side
the
greater
part
of
the
side
of
the
ship
was
gone
the
sea
was
covered
with
the
remains
of
it
in
its
place
stood
our
beautiful
pinnace
quite
uninjured
only
leaning
a
little
over
the
stocks
at
the
sight
i
cried
out
in
a
transport
that
amazed
my
sons
victory
victory
the
charming
vessel
is
our
own
it
will
be
easy
now
to
launch
her
ah
i
comprehend
now
said
fritz
papa
has
blown
up
the
ship
but
how
could
you
manage
to
do
it
so
exactly
i
explained
all
to
him
as
we
entered
through
the
broken
side
of
the
devoted
vessel
i
soon
ascertained
that
no
fire
remained
and
that
the
pinnace
had
escaped
any
injury
we
set
to
work
to
clear
away
all
the
broken
timbers
in
our
way
and
by
the
aid
of
the
and
levers
we
moved
the
pinnace
which
we
had
taken
care
to
build
on
rollers
to
the
opening
then
attaching
a
strong
cable
to
her
head
and
fixing
the
other
end
to
the
most
solid
part
of
the
ship
we
easily
launched
her
it
was
too
late
to
do
any
more
now
except
carefully
securing
our
prize
and
we
returned
to
the
good
mother
to
whom
wishing
to
give
her
an
agreeable
surprise
we
merely
said
that
the
side
of
the
vessel
was
blown
out
with
powder
but
we
were
still
able
to
obtain
more
from
it
at
which
she
sighed
and
in
her
heart
i
have
no
doubt
wished
the
vessel
and
all
it
contained
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
we
had
two
days
of
incessant
labour
in
fitting
and
loading
the
pinnace
finally
after
putting
up
our
masts
ropes
and
sails
we
selected
a
cargo
of
things
our
boats
could
not
bring
when
all
was
ready
my
boys
obtained
permission
as
a
reward
for
their
industry
to
salute
their
mamma
as
we
entered
the
bay
by
firing
our
two
guns
fritz
was
captain
and
ernest
and
jack
at
his
command
put
their
matches
to
the
guns
and
fired
my
wife
and
little
boy
rushed
out
in
alarm
but
our
joyful
shouts
soon
them
and
they
were
ready
to
welcome
us
with
astonishment
and
delight
fritz
placed
a
plank
from
the
pinnace
to
the
shore
and
assisting
his
mother
she
came
on
board
they
gave
her
a
new
salute
and
christened
the
vessel
elizabeth
after
her
my
wife
praised
our
skill
and
perseverance
but
begged
we
would
not
suppose
that
francis
and
she
had
been
idle
during
our
long
absence
we
moored
the
little
fleet
safely
to
the
shore
and
followed
her
up
the
river
to
the
cascade
where
we
saw
a
neat
garden
laid
out
in
beds
and
walks
this
is
our
work
said
she
the
soil
here
being
chiefly
composed
of
decayed
leaves
is
light
and
easy
to
dig
there
i
have
my
potatoes
there
manioc
roots
these
are
sown
with
peas
beans
and
lentils
in
this
row
of
beds
are
sown
lettuces
radishes
cabbages
and
other
european
vegetables
i
have
reserved
one
part
for
on
the
high
ground
i
have
transplanted
and
sown
melons
finally
round
every
bed
i
have
sown
a
border
of
maize
that
the
high
bushy
stems
may
protect
the
young
plants
from
the
sun
i
was
delighted
with
the
result
of
the
labour
and
industry
of
a
delicate
female
and
a
child
and
could
scarcely
believe
it
was
accomplished
in
so
short
a
time
i
must
confess
i
had
no
great
hope
of
success
at
first
said
my
wife
and
this
made
me
averse
to
speaking
of
it
afterwards
when
i
suspected
you
had
a
secret
i
determined
to
have
one
too
and
give
you
a
surprise
after
again
applauding
these
useful
labours
we
returned
to
discharge
our
cargo
and
as
we
went
my
good
elizabeth
still
full
of
horticultural
plans
reminded
me
of
the
young
we
had
brought
from
the
vessel
i
promised
to
look
after
them
next
day
and
to
establish
my
orchard
near
her
we
unloaded
our
vessels
placed
on
the
sledge
all
that
might
be
useful
at
falcon
nest
and
arranging
the
rest
under
the
tent
fixed
our
pinnace
to
the
shore
by
means
of
the
anchor
and
a
cord
fastened
to
a
heavy
stone
and
at
length
set
out
to
falcon
nest
where
we
arrived
soon
to
the
great
comfort
of
my
wife
who
dreaded
the
burning
plain
at
tent
house
chapter
xxi
after
our
return
to
falcon
nest
i
requested
my
sons
to
continue
their
exercises
in
gymnastics
i
wished
to
develope
all
the
vigour
and
energy
that
nature
had
given
them
and
which
in
our
situation
were
especially
necessary
i
added
to
archery
racing
leaping
wrestling
and
climbing
trees
either
by
the
trunks
or
by
a
rope
suspended
from
the
branches
as
sailors
climb
i
next
taught
them
to
use
the
a
powerful
weapon
by
aid
of
which
the
people
of
south
america
capture
savage
animals
i
fixed
two
balls
of
lead
to
the
ends
of
a
cord
about
a
fathom
in
length
the
patagonians
i
told
them
used
this
weapon
with
wonderful
dexterity
having
no
leaden
balls
they
attach
a
heavy
stone
to
each
end
of
a
cord
about
thirty
yards
long
if
they
wish
to
capture
an
animal
they
hurl
one
of
the
stones
at
it
with
singular
address
by
the
peculiar
art
with
which
the
ball
is
thrown
the
rope
makes
a
turn
or
two
round
the
neck
of
the
animal
which
remains
entangled
without
the
power
of
escaping
in
order
to
show
the
power
of
this
weapon
i
took
aim
at
the
trunk
of
a
tree
which
they
pointed
out
my
throw
was
quite
successful
the
end
of
the
rope
passed
two
or
three
times
round
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
remained
firmly
fixed
to
it
if
the
tree
had
been
the
neck
of
a
tiger
i
should
have
been
absolute
master
of
it
this
experiment
decided
them
all
to
learn
the
use
of
the
lasso
fritz
was
soon
skilful
in
throwing
it
and
i
encouraged
the
rest
to
persevere
in
acquiring
the
same
facility
as
the
weapon
might
be
invaluable
to
us
when
our
ammunition
failed
the
next
morning
i
saw
on
looking
out
that
the
sea
was
too
much
agitated
for
any
expedition
in
the
boats
i
therefore
turned
to
some
home
employments
we
looked
over
our
stores
for
winter
provision
my
wife
showed
me
a
cask
of
ortolans
she
had
preserved
in
butter
and
a
quantity
of
loaves
of
cassava
bread
carefully
prepared
she
pointed
out
that
the
pigeons
had
built
in
the
tree
and
were
sitting
on
their
eggs
we
then
looked
over
the
young
brought
from
europe
and
my
sons
and
i
immediately
laid
out
a
piece
of
ground
and
planted
them
the
day
passed
in
these
employments
and
as
we
had
lived
only
on
potatoes
cassava
bread
and
milk
for
this
day
we
determined
to
go
off
next
morning
in
pursuit
of
game
to
recruit
our
larder
at
dawn
of
day
we
all
started
including
little
francis
and
his
mother
who
wished
to
take
this
opportunity
of
seeing
a
little
more
of
the
country
my
sons
and
i
took
our
arms
i
harnessed
the
ass
to
the
sledge
which
contained
our
provision
for
the
day
and
was
destined
to
bring
back
the
products
of
the
chase
turk
accoutred
in
his
coat
of
mail
formed
the
advanced
guard
my
sons
followed
with
their
guns
then
came
my
wife
with
francis
leading
the
ass
and
at
a
little
distance
i
closed
the
procession
with
master
knips
mounted
on
the
patient
flora
we
crossed
flamingo
marsh
and
there
my
wife
was
charmed
with
the
richness
of
the
vegetation
and
the
lofty
trees
fritz
left
us
thinking
this
a
favourable
spot
for
game
we
soon
heard
the
report
of
his
gun
and
an
enormous
bird
fell
a
few
paces
from
us
i
ran
to
assist
him
as
he
had
much
difficulty
in
securing
his
prize
which
was
only
wounded
in
the
wing
and
was
defending
itself
vigorously
with
its
beak
and
claws
i
threw
a
handkerchief
over
its
head
and
confused
by
the
darkness
i
had
no
difficulty
in
binding
it
and
conveying
it
in
triumph
to
the
sledge
we
were
all
in
raptures
at
the
sight
of
this
beautiful
creature
which
ernest
pronounced
to
be
a
female
of
the
bustard
tribe
my
wife
hoped
that
the
bird
might
be
domesticated
among
her
poultry
and
attracting
some
more
of
its
species
might
enlarge
our
stock
of
useful
fowls
we
soon
arrived
at
the
wood
of
monkeys
as
we
called
it
where
we
had
obtained
our
and
fritz
related
the
laughable
scene
of
the
stratagem
to
his
mother
and
brothers
ernest
looked
up
wistfully
at
the
nuts
but
there
were
no
monkeys
to
throw
them
down
do
they
never
fall
from
the
trees
and
hardly
had
he
spoken
when
a
large
fell
at
his
feet
succeeded
by
a
second
to
my
great
astonishment
for
i
saw
no
animal
in
the
tree
and
i
was
convinced
the
nuts
in
the
state
as
these
were
could
not
fall
of
themselves
it
is
exactly
like
a
fairy
tale
said
ernest
i
had
only
to
speak
and
my
wish
was
accomplished
and
here
comes
the
magician
said
i
as
after
a
shower
of
nuts
i
saw
a
huge
descending
the
tree
quietly
and
quite
regardless
of
our
presence
jack
boldly
struck
a
blow
at
him
but
missed
and
the
animal
opening
its
enormous
claws
made
up
to
its
opponent
who
fled
in
terror
but
the
laughter
of
his
brothers
made
him
ashamed
and
recalling
his
courage
he
pulled
off
his
coat
and
threw
it
over
the
back
of
the
crab
this
checked
its
movements
and
going
to
his
assistance
i
killed
it
with
a
blow
of
my
hatchet
they
all
crowded
round
the
frightful
animal
anxious
to
know
what
it
was
i
told
them
it
was
a
which
we
might
call
the
crab
as
we
owed
such
a
store
to
it
being
unable
to
break
the
shell
of
the
nut
of
which
they
are
very
fond
they
climb
the
tree
and
break
them
off
in
the
unripe
state
they
then
descend
to
enjoy
their
feast
which
they
obtain
by
inserting
their
claw
through
the
small
holes
in
the
end
and
abstracting
the
contents
they
sometimes
find
them
broken
by
the
fall
when
they
can
eat
them
at
pleasure
the
hideousness
of
the
animal
and
the
mingled
terror
and
bravery
of
jack
gave
us
subject
of
conversation
for
some
time
we
placed
our
booty
on
the
sledge
and
continued
to
go
on
through
the
wood
our
path
became
every
instant
more
intricate
from
the
amazing
quantity
of
creeping
plants
which
choked
the
way
and
obliged
us
to
use
the
axe
continually
the
heat
was
excessive
and
we
got
on
slowly
when
ernest
always
observing
and
who
was
a
little
behind
us
cried
out
halt
a
new
and
important
discovery
we
returned
and
he
showed
us
that
from
the
stalk
of
one
of
the
creepers
we
had
cut
with
our
axe
there
was
issuing
clear
pure
water
it
was
the
which
in
america
furnishes
the
hunter
such
a
precious
resource
against
thirst
ernest
was
much
pleased
he
filled
a
cup
with
the
water
which
flowed
from
the
cut
stalks
like
a
fountain
and
carried
it
to
his
mother
assuring
her
she
might
drink
fearlessly
and
we
all
had
the
comfort
of
allaying
our
thirst
and
blessing
the
gracious
hand
who
has
placed
this
refreshing
plant
in
the
midst
of
the
dry
wilderness
for
the
benefit
of
man
illustration
suddenly
we
saw
ernest
running
to
us
in
great
terror
crying
wild
boar
papa
a
great
wild
boar
we
now
marched
on
with
more
vigour
and
soon
arrived
at
the
gourd
wood
where
my
wife
and
younger
sons
beheld
with
wonder
the
growth
of
this
remarkable
fruit
fritz
repeated
all
the
history
of
our
former
attempts
and
cut
some
gourds
to
make
his
mother
some
and
a
large
spoon
to
cream
the
milk
but
we
first
sat
down
under
the
shade
and
took
some
refreshment
and
afterwards
while
we
all
worked
at
making
baskets
bowls
and
flasks
ernest
who
had
no
taste
for
such
labour
explored
the
wood
suddenly
we
saw
him
running
to
us
in
great
terror
crying
a
wild
boar
papa
a
great
wild
boar
fritz
and
i
seized
our
guns
and
ran
to
the
spot
he
pointed
out
the
dogs
preceding
us
we
soon
heard
barking
and
loud
grunting
which
proved
the
combat
had
begun
and
hoping
for
a
good
prize
we
hastened
forward
when
what
was
our
vexation
when
we
found
the
dogs
holding
by
the
ears
not
a
wild
boar
but
our
own
great
sow
whose
wild
and
intractable
disposition
had
induced
her
to
leave
us
and
live
in
the
woods
we
could
not
but
laugh
at
our
disappointment
after
a
while
and
i
made
the
dogs
release
the
poor
sow
who
immediately
resumed
her
feast
on
a
small
fruit
which
had
fallen
from
the
trees
and
scattered
on
the
ground
had
evidently
tempted
the
voracious
beast
to
this
part
i
took
up
one
of
these
apples
which
somewhat
resembled
a
medlar
and
opening
it
found
the
contents
of
a
rich
and
juicy
nature
but
did
not
venture
to
taste
it
till
we
had
put
it
to
the
usual
test
we
collected
a
quantity
i
even
broke
a
loaded
branch
from
the
tree
and
we
returned
to
our
party
master
knips
no
sooner
saw
them
than
he
seized
on
some
and
crunched
them
up
with
great
enjoyment
this
satisfied
me
that
the
fruit
was
wholesome
and
we
regaled
ourselves
with
some
my
wife
was
especially
delighted
when
i
told
her
this
must
be
the
guava
from
which
the
delicious
jelly
is
obtained
so
much
prized
in
america
but
with
all
this
said
fritz
we
have
a
poor
show
of
game
do
let
us
leave
mamma
with
the
young
ones
and
set
off
to
see
what
we
can
meet
with
i
consented
and
we
left
ernest
with
his
mother
and
francis
jack
wishing
to
accompany
us
we
made
towards
the
rocks
at
the
right
hand
and
jack
preceded
us
a
little
when
he
startled
us
by
crying
out
a
crocodile
papa
a
crocodile
you
simpleton
said
i
a
crocodile
in
a
place
where
there
is
not
a
drop
of
water
papa
i
see
it
said
the
poor
child
his
eyes
fixed
on
one
spot
it
is
there
on
this
rock
sleeping
i
am
sure
it
is
a
crocodile
as
soon
as
i
was
near
enough
to
distinguish
it
i
assured
him
his
crocodile
was
a
very
harmless
lizard
called
the
whose
eggs
and
flesh
were
excellent
food
fritz
would
immediately
have
shot
at
this
frightful
creature
which
was
about
five
feet
in
length
i
showed
him
that
his
scaly
coat
rendered
such
an
attempt
useless
i
then
cut
a
strong
stick
and
a
light
wand
to
the
end
of
the
former
i
attached
a
cord
with
a
noose
this
i
held
in
my
right
hand
keeping
the
wand
in
my
left
i
approached
softly
whistling
the
animal
awoke
apparently
listening
with
pleasure
i
drew
nearer
tickling
him
gently
with
the
wand
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
opened
his
formidable
jaws
i
then
dexterously
threw
the
noose
round
his
neck
drew
it
and
jumping
on
his
back
by
the
aid
of
my
sons
held
him
down
though
he
succeeded
in
giving
jack
a
desperate
blow
with
his
tail
then
plunging
my
wand
up
his
nostrils
a
few
drops
of
blood
came
and
he
died
apparently
without
pain
we
now
carried
off
our
game
i
took
him
on
my
back
holding
him
by
the
while
my
boys
carried
the
tail
behind
me
and
with
shouts
of
laughter
the
procession
returned
to
the
sledge
poor
little
francis
was
in
great
dismay
when
he
saw
the
terrible
monster
we
brought
and
began
to
cry
but
we
rallied
him
out
of
his
cowardice
and
his
mother
satisfied
with
our
exploits
begged
to
return
home
as
the
sledge
was
heavily
laden
we
decided
to
leave
it
till
the
next
day
placing
on
the
ass
the
iguana
the
crab
our
gourd
vessels
and
a
bag
of
the
guavas
little
francis
being
also
mounted
the
bustard
we
loosed
and
securing
it
by
a
string
tied
to
one
of
its
legs
led
it
with
us
we
arrived
at
home
in
good
time
my
wife
prepared
part
of
the
iguana
for
supper
which
was
pronounced
excellent
the
crab
was
rejected
as
tough
and
tasteless
our
new
utensils
were
then
tried
the
and
the
and
fritz
was
charged
to
dig
a
hole
in
the
earth
to
be
covered
with
boards
and
serve
as
a
dairy
till
something
better
was
thought
of
finally
we
ascended
our
leafy
abode
and
slept
in
peace
chapter
xxii
i
projected
an
excursion
with
my
eldest
son
to
explore
the
limits
of
our
country
and
satisfy
ourselves
that
it
was
an
island
and
not
a
part
of
the
continent
we
set
out
ostensibly
to
bring
the
sledge
we
had
left
the
previous
evening
i
took
turk
and
the
ass
with
us
and
left
flora
with
my
wife
and
children
and
with
a
bag
of
provisions
we
left
falcon
nest
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
in
crossing
a
wood
of
oaks
covered
with
the
sweet
eatable
acorn
we
again
met
with
the
sow
our
service
to
her
in
the
evening
did
not
seem
to
be
forgotten
for
she
appeared
tamer
and
did
not
run
from
us
a
little
farther
on
we
saw
some
beautiful
birds
fritz
shot
some
among
which
i
recognized
the
large
blue
virginian
jay
and
some
different
kinds
of
parrots
as
he
was
reloading
his
gun
we
heard
at
a
distance
a
singular
noise
like
a
muffled
drum
mingled
with
the
sound
made
in
sharpening
a
saw
it
might
be
savages
and
we
plunged
into
a
thicket
and
there
discovered
the
cause
of
the
noise
in
a
brilliant
green
bird
seated
on
the
withered
trunk
of
a
tree
it
spread
its
wings
and
tail
and
strutted
about
with
strange
contortions
to
the
great
delight
of
its
mates
who
seemed
lost
in
admiration
of
him
at
the
same
time
he
made
the
sharp
cry
we
heard
and
striking
his
wing
against
the
tree
produced
the
sound
i
knew
this
to
be
the
one
of
the
greatest
ornaments
of
the
forests
of
america
my
insatiable
hunter
soon
put
an
end
to
the
scene
he
fired
at
the
bird
who
fell
dead
and
his
crowd
of
admirers
with
piercing
cries
took
to
flight
i
reprimanded
my
son
for
so
rashly
killing
everything
we
met
with
without
consideration
and
for
the
mere
love
of
destruction
he
seemed
sensible
of
his
error
and
as
the
thing
was
done
i
thought
it
as
well
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
sent
him
to
pick
up
his
game
what
a
creature
said
he
as
he
brought
it
how
it
would
have
figured
in
our
if
i
had
not
been
in
such
a
hurry
we
went
on
to
our
sledge
in
the
gourd
wood
and
as
the
morning
was
not
far
advanced
we
determined
to
leave
all
here
and
proceed
in
our
projected
excursion
beyond
the
chain
of
rocks
but
we
took
the
ass
with
us
to
carry
our
provisions
and
any
game
or
other
object
we
should
meet
with
in
the
new
country
we
hoped
to
penetrate
amongst
gigantic
trees
and
through
grass
of
a
prodigious
height
we
travelled
with
some
labour
looking
right
and
left
to
avoid
danger
or
to
make
discoveries
turk
walked
the
first
smelling
the
air
then
came
the
donkey
with
his
grave
and
careless
step
and
we
followed
with
our
guns
in
readiness
we
met
with
plains
of
potatoes
and
of
manioc
amongst
the
stalks
of
which
were
sporting
tribes
of
agoutis
but
we
were
not
tempted
by
such
game
we
now
met
with
a
new
kind
of
bush
covered
with
small
white
berries
about
the
size
of
a
pea
on
pressing
these
berries
which
adhered
to
my
fingers
i
discovered
that
this
plant
was
the
cerifera
or
myrtle
from
which
a
wax
is
obtained
that
may
be
made
into
candles
with
great
pleasure
i
gathered
a
bag
of
these
berries
knowing
how
my
wife
would
appreciate
this
acquisition
for
she
often
lamented
that
we
were
compelled
to
go
to
bed
with
the
birds
as
soon
as
the
sun
set
we
forgot
our
fatigue
as
we
proceeded
in
contemplation
of
the
wonders
of
nature
flowers
of
marvellous
beauty
butterflies
of
more
dazzling
colours
than
the
flowers
and
birds
graceful
in
form
and
brilliant
in
plumage
fritz
climbed
a
tree
and
succeeded
in
securing
a
young
green
parrot
which
he
enveloped
in
his
handkerchief
with
the
intention
of
bringing
it
up
and
teaching
it
to
speak
and
now
we
met
with
another
wonder
a
number
of
birds
who
lived
in
a
community
in
nests
sheltered
by
a
common
roof
in
the
formation
of
which
they
had
probably
laboured
jointly
this
roof
was
composed
of
straw
and
dry
sticks
plastered
with
clay
which
rendered
it
equally
impenetrable
to
sun
or
rain
pressed
as
we
were
for
time
i
could
not
help
stopping
to
admire
this
feathered
colony
this
leading
us
to
speak
of
natural
history
as
it
relates
to
animals
who
live
in
societies
we
recalled
in
succession
the
ingenious
labours
of
the
beavers
and
the
marmots
the
not
less
marvellous
constructions
of
the
bees
the
wasps
and
the
ants
and
i
mentioned
particularly
those
immense
of
america
of
which
the
masonry
is
finished
with
such
skill
and
solidity
that
they
are
sometimes
used
for
ovens
to
which
they
bear
a
resemblance
we
had
now
reached
some
trees
quite
unknown
to
us
they
were
from
forty
to
sixty
feet
in
height
and
from
the
bark
which
was
cracked
in
many
places
issued
small
balls
of
a
thick
gum
fritz
got
one
off
with
difficulty
it
was
so
hardened
by
the
sun
he
wished
to
soften
it
with
his
hands
but
found
that
heat
only
gave
it
the
power
of
extension
and
that
by
pulling
the
two
extremities
and
then
releasing
them
it
immediately
resumed
its
first
form
fritz
ran
to
me
crying
out
i
have
found
some
if
that
be
true
said
i
you
have
made
a
most
valuable
discovery
he
thought
i
was
laughing
at
him
for
we
had
no
drawing
to
rub
out
here
i
told
him
this
gum
might
be
turned
to
many
useful
purposes
among
the
rest
we
might
make
excellent
shoes
of
it
this
interested
him
how
could
we
accomplish
this
the
caoutchouc
said
i
is
the
milky
sap
which
is
obtained
from
certain
trees
of
the
kind
by
incisions
made
in
the
bark
it
is
collected
in
vessels
care
being
taken
to
agitate
them
that
the
liquid
may
not
coagulate
in
this
state
they
cover
little
clay
bottles
with
successive
layers
of
it
till
it
attains
the
required
thickness
it
is
then
dried
in
smoke
which
gives
it
the
dark
brown
colour
before
it
is
quite
dry
it
is
ornamented
by
lines
and
flowers
drawn
with
the
knife
finally
they
break
the
clay
form
and
extract
it
from
the
mouth
and
there
remains
the
bottle
of
commerce
soft
and
flexible
now
this
is
my
plan
for
shoemaking
we
will
fill
a
stocking
with
sand
cover
it
with
repeated
layers
of
the
gum
till
it
is
of
the
proper
thickness
then
empty
out
the
sand
and
if
i
do
not
deceive
myself
we
shall
have
perfect
boots
or
shoes
comfortable
in
the
hope
of
new
boots
we
advanced
through
an
interminable
forest
of
various
trees
the
monkeys
on
the
trees
furnished
us
with
pleasant
refreshment
and
a
small
store
of
nuts
besides
among
these
trees
i
saw
some
lower
bushes
whose
leaves
were
covered
with
a
white
dust
i
opened
the
trunk
of
one
of
these
which
had
been
torn
up
by
the
wind
and
found
in
the
interior
a
white
farinaceous
substance
which
on
tasting
i
knew
to
be
the
sago
imported
into
europe
this
as
connected
with
our
subsistence
was
a
most
important
affair
and
my
son
and
i
with
our
hatchets
laid
open
the
tree
and
obtained
from
it
pounds
of
the
valuable
sago
this
occupied
us
an
hour
and
weary
and
hungry
i
thought
it
prudent
not
to
push
our
discoveries
farther
this
day
we
therefore
returned
to
the
gourd
wood
placed
all
our
treasures
on
the
sledge
and
took
our
way
home
we
arrived
without
more
adventures
and
were
warmly
greeted
and
our
various
offerings
gratefully
welcomed
especially
the
green
parrot
we
talked
of
the
caoutchouc
and
new
boots
with
great
delight
during
supper
and
afterwards
my
wife
looked
with
exceeding
content
at
her
bag
of
anticipating
the
time
when
we
should
not
have
to
go
to
bed
as
we
did
now
as
soon
as
the
sun
set
chapter
xxiii
the
next
morning
my
wife
and
children
besought
me
to
begin
my
manufacture
of
candles
i
remembered
having
seen
the
chandler
at
work
and
i
tried
to
recall
all
my
remembrances
of
the
process
i
put
into
a
boiler
as
many
berries
as
it
would
hold
and
placed
it
over
a
moderate
fire
the
wax
melted
from
the
berries
and
rose
to
the
surface
and
this
i
carefully
skimmed
with
a
large
flat
spoon
and
put
in
a
separate
vessel
placed
near
the
fire
when
this
was
done
my
wife
supplied
me
with
some
wicks
she
had
made
from
the
threads
of
sailcloth
these
wicks
were
attached
four
at
a
time
to
a
small
stick
i
dipped
them
into
the
wax
and
placed
them
on
two
branches
of
a
tree
to
dry
i
repeated
this
operation
as
often
as
necessary
to
make
them
the
proper
thickness
and
then
placed
them
in
a
cool
spot
to
harden
but
we
could
not
forbear
trying
them
that
very
night
and
thought
somewhat
rude
in
form
it
was
sufficient
that
they
reminded
us
of
our
european
home
and
prolonged
our
days
by
many
useful
hours
we
had
lost
before
this
encouraged
me
to
attempt
another
enterprise
my
wife
had
long
regretted
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
make
butter
she
had
attempted
to
beat
her
cream
in
a
vessel
but
either
the
heat
of
the
climate
or
her
want
of
patience
rendered
her
trials
unsuccessful
i
felt
that
i
had
not
skill
enough
to
make
a
churn
but
i
fancied
that
by
some
simple
method
like
that
used
by
the
hottentots
who
put
their
cream
in
a
skin
and
shake
it
till
they
produce
butter
we
might
obtain
the
same
result
i
cut
a
large
gourd
in
two
filled
it
with
three
quarts
of
cream
then
united
the
parts
and
secured
them
closely
i
fastened
a
stick
to
each
corner
of
a
square
piece
of
sailcloth
placed
the
gourd
in
the
middle
and
giving
a
corner
to
each
of
my
sons
directed
them
to
rock
the
cloth
with
a
slow
regular
motion
as
you
would
a
child
cradle
this
was
quite
an
amusement
for
them
and
at
the
end
of
an
hour
my
wife
had
the
pleasure
of
placing
before
us
some
excellent
butter
i
then
tried
to
make
a
cart
our
sledge
being
unfitted
for
some
roads
the
wheels
i
had
brought
from
the
wreck
rendered
this
less
difficult
and
i
completed
a
very
rude
vehicle
which
was
nevertheless
very
useful
to
us
while
i
was
thus
usefully
employed
my
wife
and
children
were
not
idle
they
had
transplanted
the
european
trees
and
thoughtfully
placed
each
in
the
situation
best
suited
to
it
i
assisted
with
my
hands
and
counsels
the
vines
we
planted
round
the
roots
of
our
trees
and
hoped
in
time
to
form
a
of
the
chesnut
walnut
and
we
formed
an
avenue
from
falcon
nest
to
family
bridge
which
we
hoped
would
ultimately
be
a
shady
road
between
our
two
mansions
we
made
a
solid
road
between
the
two
rows
of
trees
raised
in
the
middle
and
covered
with
sand
which
we
brought
from
the
shore
in
our
wheelbarrows
i
also
made
a
sort
of
tumbril
to
which
we
harnessed
the
ass
to
lighten
this
difficult
labour
we
then
turned
our
thoughts
to
tent
house
our
first
abode
and
which
still
might
form
our
refuge
in
case
of
danger
nature
had
not
favoured
it
but
our
labour
soon
supplied
all
deficiencies
we
planted
round
it
every
tree
that
requires
ardent
heat
the
citron
pistachio
the
almond
the
mulberry
the
siamese
orange
of
which
the
fruit
is
as
large
as
the
head
of
a
child
and
the
indian
fig
with
its
long
prickly
leaves
all
had
a
place
here
these
plantations
succeeding
admirably
we
had
after
some
time
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
dry
and
sandy
desert
converted
into
a
shady
grove
rich
in
flowers
and
fruit
as
this
place
was
the
magazine
for
our
arms
ammunition
and
provisions
of
all
sorts
we
made
a
sort
of
fortress
of
it
surrounding
it
with
a
high
hedge
of
strong
thorny
trees
so
that
not
only
to
wild
beasts
but
even
to
human
enemies
it
was
inaccessible
our
bridge
was
the
only
point
of
approach
and
we
always
carefully
removed
the
first
planks
after
crossing
it
we
also
placed
our
two
cannon
on
a
little
elevation
within
the
enclosure
and
finally
we
planted
some
cedars
near
our
usual
to
which
we
might
at
a
future
time
fasten
our
vessels
these
labours
occupied
us
three
months
only
interrupted
by
a
strict
attention
to
the
devotions
and
duties
of
the
sunday
i
was
most
especially
grateful
to
god
for
the
robust
health
we
all
enjoyed
in
the
midst
of
our
employments
all
went
on
well
in
our
little
colony
we
had
an
abundant
and
certain
supply
of
provisions
but
our
wardrobe
notwithstanding
the
continual
repairing
my
wife
bestowed
on
it
was
in
a
most
wretched
state
and
we
had
no
means
of
renewing
it
except
by
again
visiting
the
wreck
which
i
knew
still
contained
some
chests
of
clothes
and
bales
of
cloth
this
decided
me
to
make
another
voyage
besides
i
was
rather
anxious
to
see
the
state
of
the
vessel
we
found
it
much
in
the
same
condition
we
had
left
it
except
being
much
more
shattered
by
the
winds
and
waves
we
selected
many
useful
things
for
our
cargo
the
bales
of
linen
and
woollen
cloth
were
not
forgotten
some
barrels
of
tar
and
everything
portable
that
we
could
remove
doors
windows
tables
benches
locks
and
bolts
all
the
ammunition
and
even
such
of
the
guns
as
we
could
move
in
fact
we
completely
sacked
the
vessel
carrying
off
after
several
days
labour
all
our
booty
with
the
exception
of
some
weighty
articles
amongst
which
were
three
or
four
immense
boilers
intended
for
a
these
we
tied
to
some
large
empty
casks
which
we
pitched
completely
over
and
hoped
they
would
be
able
to
float
in
the
water
when
we
had
completed
our
arrangements
i
resolved
to
blow
up
the
ship
we
placed
a
large
barrel
of
gunpowder
in
the
hold
and
arranging
a
long
match
from
it
which
would
burn
some
hours
we
lighted
it
and
proceeded
without
delay
to
safety
bay
to
watch
the
event
i
proposed
to
my
wife
to
sup
on
a
point
of
land
where
we
could
distinctly
see
the
vessel
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down
a
majestic
rolling
like
thunder
succeeded
by
a
column
of
fire
announced
the
destruction
of
the
vessel
which
had
brought
us
from
europe
and
bestowed
its
great
riches
on
us
we
could
not
help
shedding
tears
as
we
heard
the
last
mournful
cry
of
this
sole
remaining
bond
that
connected
us
with
home
we
returned
sorrowfully
to
tent
house
and
felt
as
if
we
had
lost
an
old
friend
we
rose
early
next
morning
and
hastened
to
the
shore
which
we
found
covered
with
the
wreck
which
with
a
little
exertion
we
found
it
easy
to
collect
amongst
the
rest
were
the
large
boilers
we
afterwards
used
these
to
cover
our
barrels
of
gunpowder
which
we
placed
in
a
part
of
the
rock
where
even
if
an
explosion
took
place
no
damage
could
ensue
my
wife
in
assisting
us
with
the
wreck
made
the
agreeable
discovery
that
two
of
our
ducks
and
one
goose
had
hatched
each
a
brood
and
were
leading
their
noisy
young
families
to
the
water
this
reminded
us
of
all
our
poultry
and
domestic
comfort
at
falcon
nest
and
we
determined
to
defer
for
some
time
the
rest
of
our
work
at
tent
house
and
to
return
the
next
day
to
our
shady
summer
home
chapter
xxiv
as
we
went
along
the
avenue
of
i
was
concerned
to
see
my
young
plants
beginning
to
droop
and
i
immediately
resolved
to
proceed
to
cape
disappointment
the
next
morning
to
cut
bamboos
to
make
props
for
them
it
was
determined
we
should
all
go
as
on
our
arrival
at
falcon
nest
we
discovered
many
other
supplies
wanting
the
candles
were
failing
we
must
have
more
berries
for
now
my
wife
sewed
by
candlelight
while
i
wrote
my
journal
she
wanted
also
some
eggs
to
set
under
her
hens
jack
wanted
some
guavas
and
francis
wished
for
some
so
we
made
a
family
tour
of
it
taking
the
cart
with
the
cow
and
ass
to
contain
our
provision
and
a
large
sailcloth
to
make
a
tent
the
weather
was
delightful
and
we
set
out
singing
in
great
spirits
we
crossed
the
potato
and
manioc
plantations
and
the
wood
of
guavas
on
which
my
boys
feasted
to
their
great
satisfaction
the
road
was
rugged
but
we
assisted
to
move
the
cart
and
rested
frequently
we
stopped
to
see
the
bird
colony
which
greatly
delighted
them
all
and
ernest
declared
they
belonged
to
the
species
of
the
sociable
grosbeak
he
pointed
out
to
us
their
wonderful
instinct
in
forming
their
colony
in
the
midst
of
the
bushes
on
which
they
feed
we
filled
two
bags
with
these
berries
and
another
with
guavas
my
wife
proposing
to
make
jelly
from
them
we
then
proceeded
to
the
and
here
i
determined
to
rest
awhile
to
collect
some
of
the
valuable
gum
i
had
brought
some
large
with
me
for
the
purpose
i
made
incisions
in
the
trees
and
placed
these
bowls
to
receive
the
gum
which
soon
began
to
run
out
in
a
milky
stream
and
we
hoped
to
find
them
filled
on
our
return
we
turned
a
little
to
the
left
and
entered
a
beautiful
and
fertile
plain
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
behind
which
rose
a
wood
of
palms
on
the
other
by
the
bamboos
and
before
us
was
cape
disappointment
backed
by
the
ocean
a
magnificent
picture
we
at
once
decided
to
make
this
our
we
even
thought
of
transferring
our
residence
from
falcon
nest
to
this
spot
but
we
dismissed
the
thought
when
we
reflected
on
the
perfect
security
of
our
dear
castle
in
the
air
we
contented
ourselves
with
arranging
to
make
this
always
our
station
for
refreshment
in
our
excursions
we
loosed
our
animals
and
allowed
them
to
graze
on
the
rich
grass
around
us
we
arranged
to
spend
the
night
here
and
taking
a
light
repast
we
separated
on
our
several
employments
some
to
cut
others
bamboos
and
after
stripping
them
to
make
them
into
bundles
and
place
them
in
the
cart
this
hard
work
made
the
boys
hungry
they
refreshed
themselves
with
but
had
a
great
desire
to
have
some
unfortunately
there
were
neither
monkeys
nor
crabs
to
bestow
them
and
the
many
attempts
they
made
to
climb
the
lofty
bare
trunk
of
the
palm
ended
only
in
disappointment
and
confusion
i
went
to
their
assistance
i
gave
them
pieces
of
the
rough
skin
of
the
shark
which
i
had
brought
for
the
purpose
to
brace
on
their
legs
and
showing
them
how
to
climb
by
the
aid
of
a
cord
fastened
round
the
tree
with
a
running
noose
a
method
practised
with
success
by
the
savages
my
little
climbers
soon
reached
the
summit
of
the
trees
they
then
used
their
hatchets
which
they
had
carried
up
in
their
girdles
and
a
shower
of
fell
down
these
furnished
a
pleasant
dessert
enlivened
by
the
jests
of
fritz
and
jack
who
being
the
climbers
did
not
spare
doctor
ernest
who
had
contented
himself
with
looking
up
at
them
and
even
now
regardless
of
their
banter
he
was
lost
in
some
new
idea
rising
suddenly
and
looking
at
the
palms
he
took
a
cup
and
a
tin
flask
with
a
handle
and
gravely
addressed
us
thus
gentlemen
and
lady
this
exercise
of
climbing
is
really
very
disagreeable
and
difficult
but
since
it
confers
so
much
honour
on
the
undertakers
i
should
like
also
to
attempt
an
adventure
hoping
to
do
something
at
once
glorious
and
agreeable
to
the
company
he
then
bound
his
legs
with
the
pieces
of
shark
skin
and
with
singular
vigour
and
agility
sprung
up
a
palm
which
he
had
long
been
attentively
examining
his
brothers
laughed
loudly
at
his
taking
the
trouble
to
ascend
a
tree
that
had
not
a
single
nut
on
it
ernest
took
no
notice
of
their
ridicule
but
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
top
struck
with
his
hatchet
and
a
tuft
of
tender
yellow
leaves
fell
at
our
feet
which
i
recognized
as
the
product
of
the
a
delicate
food
highly
valued
in
america
his
mother
thought
it
a
mischievous
act
to
destroy
the
tree
thus
but
he
assured
her
his
prize
was
worth
many
but
our
hero
did
not
descend
and
i
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
replace
the
cabbage
he
had
cut
off
wait
a
little
said
he
i
am
bringing
you
some
wine
to
drink
my
health
but
it
comes
slower
than
i
could
wish
he
now
descended
holding
his
into
which
he
poured
from
the
flask
a
clear
liquor
and
presenting
it
to
me
begged
me
to
drink
it
was
indeed
the
true
which
is
as
pleasant
as
champaign
and
taken
moderately
a
great
restorative
we
all
drank
and
ernest
was
praised
and
thanked
by
all
till
he
forgot
all
the
scoffs
he
had
received
as
it
was
getting
late
we
set
about
putting
up
our
tent
for
the
night
when
suddenly
our
ass
who
had
been
quietly
grazing
near
us
began
to
bray
furiously
erected
his
ears
kicking
right
and
left
and
plunging
into
the
bamboos
disappeared
this
made
us
very
uneasy
i
could
not
submit
to
lose
the
useful
animal
and
moreover
i
was
afraid
his
agitation
announced
the
approach
of
some
wild
beast
the
dogs
and
i
sought
for
any
trace
of
it
in
vain
i
therefore
to
guard
against
any
danger
made
a
large
fire
before
our
tent
which
i
continued
to
watch
till
midnight
when
all
being
still
i
crept
into
the
tent
to
my
bed
of
moss
and
slept
undisturbed
till
morning
in
the
morning
we
thanked
god
for
our
health
and
safety
and
then
began
to
lament
our
poor
donkey
which
i
hoped
might
have
been
attracted
by
the
light
of
our
fire
and
have
returned
but
we
saw
nothing
of
him
and
we
decided
that
his
services
were
so
indispensable
that
i
should
go
with
one
of
my
sons
and
the
two
dogs
in
search
of
him
and
cross
the
thickets
of
bamboo
i
chose
to
take
jack
with
me
to
his
great
satisfaction
for
fritz
and
ernest
formed
a
better
guard
for
their
mother
in
a
strange
place
we
set
out
well
armed
with
bags
of
provisions
on
our
back
and
after
an
hour
fruitless
search
among
the
canes
we
emerged
beyond
them
in
an
extensive
plain
on
the
borders
of
the
great
bay
we
saw
that
the
ridge
of
rocks
still
extended
on
the
right
till
it
nearly
reached
the
shore
when
it
abruptly
terminated
in
a
perpendicular
precipice
a
considerable
river
flowed
into
the
bay
here
and
between
the
river
and
the
rock
was
a
narrow
passage
which
at
high
water
would
be
overflowed
we
thought
it
most
likely
that
our
ass
had
passed
by
this
defile
and
i
wished
to
see
whether
these
rocks
merely
bordered
or
divided
the
island
we
therefore
went
forward
till
we
met
with
a
stream
which
fell
in
a
cascade
from
a
mass
of
rocks
into
the
river
we
ascended
the
stream
till
we
found
a
place
shallow
enough
to
cross
here
we
saw
the
shoemarks
of
our
ass
mingled
with
the
footsteps
of
other
animals
and
at
a
distance
we
saw
a
herd
of
animals
but
could
not
distinguish
what
they
were
we
ascended
a
little
hill
and
through
our
telescope
saw
a
most
beautiful
and
fertile
country
breathing
peace
and
repose
to
our
right
rose
the
majestic
chain
of
rocks
that
divided
the
island
on
our
left
a
succession
of
beautiful
green
hills
spread
to
the
horizon
woods
of
palms
and
various
unknown
trees
were
scattered
over
the
scene
the
beautiful
stream
meandered
across
the
valley
like
a
silver
ribbon
bordered
by
rushes
and
other
aquatic
plants
there
was
no
trace
of
the
footstep
of
man
the
country
had
all
the
purity
of
its
first
creation
no
living
creatures
but
some
beautiful
birds
and
brilliant
butterflies
appeared
but
at
a
distance
we
saw
some
specks
which
i
concluded
were
the
animals
we
had
first
seen
and
i
resolved
to
go
nearer
in
hopes
our
ass
might
have
joined
them
we
made
towards
the
spot
and
to
shorten
the
road
crossed
a
little
wood
of
bamboos
the
stalks
of
which
as
thick
as
a
man
thigh
rose
to
the
height
of
thirty
feet
i
suspected
this
to
be
the
giant
reed
of
america
so
useful
for
the
masts
of
boats
and
canoes
i
promised
jack
to
allow
him
to
cut
some
on
our
return
but
at
present
the
ass
was
my
sole
care
when
we
had
crossed
the
wood
we
suddenly
came
face
to
face
on
a
herd
of
buffaloes
not
numerous
certainly
but
formidable
in
appearance
at
the
sight
i
was
absolutely
petrified
and
my
gun
useless
fortunately
the
dogs
were
in
the
rear
and
the
animals
lifting
their
heads
and
fixing
their
large
eyes
on
us
seemed
more
astonished
than
angry
we
were
the
first
men
probably
they
had
ever
seen
we
drew
back
a
little
prepared
our
arms
and
endeavoured
to
retreat
when
the
dogs
arrived
and
notwithstanding
our
efforts
to
restrain
them
flew
at
the
buffaloes
it
was
no
time
now
to
retreat
the
combat
was
begun
the
whole
troop
uttered
the
most
frightful
roars
beat
the
ground
with
their
feet
and
butted
with
their
horns
our
brave
dogs
were
not
intimidated
but
marched
straight
upon
the
enemy
and
falling
on
a
young
buffalo
that
had
strayed
before
the
rest
seized
it
by
the
ears
the
creature
began
to
bellow
and
struggle
to
escape
its
mother
ran
to
its
assistance
and
with
her
the
whole
herd
at
that
moment
i
tremble
as
i
write
it
i
gave
the
signal
to
my
brave
jack
who
behaved
with
admirable
coolness
and
at
the
same
moment
we
fired
on
the
herd
the
effect
was
wonderful
they
paused
a
moment
and
then
even
before
the
smoke
was
dissipated
took
to
flight
with
incredible
rapidity
forded
the
river
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
my
dogs
still
held
their
prize
and
the
mother
though
wounded
by
our
shot
tore
up
the
ground
in
her
fury
and
was
advancing
on
the
dogs
to
destroy
them
but
i
stepped
forward
and
discharging
a
pistol
between
the
horns
put
an
end
to
her
life
we
began
to
breathe
we
had
looked
death
in
the
face
a
most
horrible
death
and
thanked
god
for
our
preservation
i
praised
jack
for
his
courage
and
presence
of
mind
any
fear
or
agitation
on
his
part
would
have
unnerved
me
and
rendered
our
fate
certain
the
dogs
still
held
the
young
calf
by
the
ears
it
bellowed
incessantly
and
i
feared
they
would
either
be
injured
or
lose
their
prize
i
went
up
to
their
assistance
i
hardly
knew
how
to
act
i
could
easily
have
killed
it
but
i
had
a
great
desire
to
carry
it
off
alive
and
try
to
tame
it
to
replace
our
ass
whom
i
did
not
intend
to
follow
farther
a
happy
idea
struck
jack
he
always
carried
his
lasso
in
his
pocket
he
drew
it
out
retired
a
little
and
flung
it
so
dexterously
that
he
completely
wound
it
round
the
hind
legs
of
the
calf
and
threw
it
down
i
now
approached
i
replaced
the
lasso
by
a
stronger
cord
and
used
another
to
bind
his
fore
legs
loosely
jack
cried
victory
and
already
thought
how
his
mother
and
brothers
would
be
delighted
when
we
presented
it
but
that
was
no
easy
matter
at
last
i
thought
of
the
method
used
in
italy
to
tame
the
wild
bulls
and
i
resolved
to
try
it
though
it
was
a
little
cruel
i
began
by
tying
to
the
foot
of
a
tree
the
cords
that
held
the
legs
then
making
the
dogs
seize
him
again
by
the
ears
i
caught
hold
of
his
mouth
and
with
a
sharp
knife
perforated
the
nostril
and
quickly
passed
a
cord
through
the
opening
this
cord
was
to
serve
as
my
rein
to
guide
the
animal
the
operation
was
successful
and
as
soon
as
the
blood
ceased
to
flow
i
took
the
cord
uniting
the
two
ends
and
the
poor
suffering
creature
completely
subdued
followed
me
without
resistance
i
was
unwilling
to
abandon
the
whole
of
the
buffalo
i
had
killed
as
it
is
excellent
meat
i
therefore
cut
out
the
tongue
and
some
of
the
best
parts
from
the
loin
and
covered
them
well
with
salt
of
which
we
had
taken
a
provision
with
us
i
then
carefully
skinned
the
four
legs
remembering
that
the
american
hunters
use
these
skins
for
boots
being
remarkably
soft
and
flexible
we
permitted
the
dogs
to
feast
on
the
remainder
and
while
they
were
enjoying
themselves
we
washed
ourselves
and
sat
down
under
a
tree
to
rest
and
refresh
ourselves
but
the
poor
beasts
had
soon
many
guests
at
their
banquet
clouds
of
birds
of
prey
came
from
every
part
an
incessant
combat
was
kept
up
no
sooner
was
one
troop
of
brigands
satisfied
than
another
succeeded
and
soon
all
that
remained
of
the
poor
buffalo
was
the
bones
i
noticed
amongst
these
ravenous
birds
the
royal
vulture
an
elegant
bird
remarkable
for
a
brilliant
collar
of
down
we
could
easily
have
killed
some
of
these
robbers
but
i
thought
it
useless
to
destroy
for
mere
curiosity
and
i
preferred
employing
our
time
in
cutting
with
a
small
saw
we
had
brought
some
of
the
gigantic
reeds
that
grew
round
us
we
cut
several
of
the
very
thick
ones
which
make
excellent
vessels
when
separated
at
the
joints
but
i
perceived
that
jack
was
cutting
some
of
small
dimensions
and
i
inquired
if
he
was
going
to
make
a
pandean
pipe
to
celebrate
his
triumphal
return
with
the
buffalo
no
said
he
i
do
recollect
that
robinson
crusoe
amused
himself
with
music
in
his
island
but
i
have
thought
of
something
that
will
be
useful
to
mamma
i
am
cutting
these
reeds
to
make
moulds
for
our
candles
an
excellent
thought
my
dear
boy
said
i
and
if
even
we
break
our
moulds
in
getting
out
the
candles
which
i
suspect
we
may
we
know
where
they
grow
and
can
come
for
more
we
collected
all
our
reeds
in
bundles
and
then
set
out
the
calf
intimidated
by
the
dogs
and
galled
by
the
rein
went
on
tolerably
well
we
crossed
the
narrow
pass
in
the
rocks
and
here
our
dogs
killed
a
large
jackal
which
was
coming
from
her
den
in
the
rock
the
furious
animals
then
entered
the
den
followed
by
jack
who
saved
with
difficulty
one
of
the
young
cubs
the
others
being
immediately
worried
it
was
a
pretty
little
creature
about
the
size
of
a
cat
jack
petitioned
earnestly
to
have
it
to
bring
up
and
i
made
him
happy
by
granting
his
request
in
the
mean
time
i
had
tied
the
calf
to
a
low
tree
which
i
discovered
was
the
thorny
dwarf
palm
which
grows
quickly
and
is
extremely
useful
for
fences
it
bears
an
oblong
fruit
about
the
size
of
a
pigeon
egg
from
which
is
extracted
an
oil
which
is
an
excellent
substitute
for
butter
i
determined
to
return
for
some
young
plants
of
this
palm
to
plant
at
tent
house
it
was
almost
night
when
we
joined
our
family
and
endless
were
the
questions
the
sight
of
the
buffalo
produced
and
great
was
the
boasting
of
jack
the
dauntless
i
was
compelled
to
lower
his
pride
a
little
by
an
unvarnished
statement
though
i
gave
him
much
credit
for
his
coolness
and
resolution
and
arriving
my
wife
had
time
to
tell
me
what
had
passed
while
we
had
been
on
our
expedition
chapter
xxv
my
wife
began
by
saying
they
had
not
been
idle
in
my
absence
they
had
collected
wood
and
made
torches
for
the
night
fritz
and
ernest
had
even
cut
down
an
immense
seventy
feet
high
intending
to
extract
its
precious
pith
but
this
they
had
been
unable
to
accomplish
alone
and
waited
for
my
assistance
but
while
they
were
engaged
in
this
employment
a
troop
of
monkeys
had
broken
into
the
tent
and
pillaged
and
destroyed
everything
they
had
drunk
or
overturned
the
milk
and
carried
off
or
spoiled
all
our
provisions
and
even
so
much
injured
the
palisade
i
had
erected
round
the
tent
that
it
took
them
an
hour
after
they
returned
to
repair
the
damage
fritz
had
made
also
a
beautiful
capture
in
a
nest
he
had
discovered
in
the
rocks
at
cape
disappointment
it
was
a
superb
bird
and
though
very
young
quite
feathered
ernest
had
pronounced
it
to
be
the
eagle
of
malabar
and
i
confirmed
his
assertion
and
as
this
species
of
eagle
is
not
large
and
does
not
require
much
food
i
advised
him
to
train
it
as
a
falcon
to
chase
other
birds
i
took
this
opportunity
to
announce
that
henceforward
every
one
must
attend
to
his
own
live
stock
or
they
should
be
set
at
liberty
mamma
having
sufficient
to
manage
in
her
own
charge
we
then
made
a
fire
of
green
wood
in
the
smoke
of
which
we
placed
the
we
had
brought
home
leaving
it
during
the
night
that
it
might
be
perfectly
cured
we
had
had
some
for
supper
and
thought
it
excellent
the
young
buffalo
was
beginning
to
graze
and
we
gave
him
a
little
milk
as
well
as
to
the
jackal
fritz
had
taken
the
precaution
to
cover
the
eyes
of
his
eagle
and
tying
it
fast
by
the
leg
to
a
branch
it
rested
very
tranquilly
we
then
retired
to
our
mossy
beds
to
recruit
our
strength
for
the
labours
of
another
day
at
break
of
day
we
rose
made
a
light
breakfast
and
i
was
about
to
give
the
signal
of
departure
when
my
wife
communicated
to
me
the
difficulty
they
had
had
in
cutting
down
the
and
the
valuable
provision
that
might
be
obtained
from
it
with
a
little
trouble
i
thought
she
was
right
and
decided
to
remain
here
another
day
for
it
was
no
trifling
undertaking
to
split
up
a
tree
seventy
feet
long
i
consented
the
more
readily
as
i
thought
i
might
after
removing
the
useful
pith
from
the
trunk
obtain
two
large
spouts
or
channels
to
conduct
the
water
from
jackal
river
to
the
kitchen
garden
such
tools
as
we
had
we
carried
to
the
place
where
the
tree
lay
we
first
sawed
off
the
head
then
with
the
hatchet
making
an
opening
at
each
end
we
took
wedges
and
mallets
and
the
wood
being
tolerably
soft
after
four
hours
labour
we
succeeded
in
splitting
it
completely
when
parted
we
pressed
the
pith
with
our
hands
to
get
the
whole
into
one
division
of
the
trunk
and
began
to
make
our
paste
at
one
end
of
the
spout
we
nailed
one
of
the
graters
through
which
we
intended
to
force
the
paste
to
form
the
round
seeds
my
little
bakers
set
vigorously
to
work
some
pouring
water
on
the
pith
while
the
rest
mixed
it
into
paste
when
sufficiently
worked
i
pressed
it
strongly
with
my
hand
against
the
grater
the
farinaceous
parts
passed
easily
through
the
holes
while
the
part
consisting
of
splinters
of
wood
c
was
left
behind
this
we
threw
into
a
heap
hoping
mushrooms
might
spring
from
it
my
wife
now
carefully
spread
the
grains
on
sailcloth
in
the
sun
to
dry
them
i
also
formed
some
vermicelli
by
giving
more
consistence
to
the
paste
and
forcing
it
through
the
holes
in
little
pipes
my
wife
promised
with
this
and
the
dutch
cheese
to
make
us
a
dish
equal
to
naples
maccaroni
we
were
now
contented
we
could
at
any
time
obtain
more
sago
by
cutting
down
a
tree
and
we
were
anxious
to
get
home
to
try
our
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
loading
the
cart
with
our
utensils
and
the
halves
of
the
tree
we
retired
to
our
hut
at
sunset
and
slept
in
peace
the
next
morning
the
whole
caravan
began
to
move
at
an
early
hour
the
buffalo
harnessed
to
the
cart
by
the
side
of
his
nurse
the
cow
took
the
place
of
our
lost
ass
and
began
his
apprenticeship
as
a
beast
of
draught
we
took
the
same
road
on
our
return
that
we
might
carry
away
the
and
the
vessels
of
the
vanguard
was
composed
of
fritz
and
jack
who
pioneered
our
way
by
cutting
down
the
underwood
to
make
a
road
for
the
cart
our
being
very
long
somewhat
impeded
our
progress
but
we
happily
reached
the
trees
without
accident
and
placed
our
sacks
on
the
cart
we
did
not
find
more
than
a
quart
of
the
caoutchouc
gum
but
it
would
be
sufficient
for
our
first
experiment
and
i
carried
it
off
in
crossing
the
little
wood
of
guavas
we
suddenly
heard
our
dogs
who
were
before
us
with
fritz
and
jack
uttering
the
most
frightful
howlings
i
was
struck
with
terror
lest
they
should
have
encountered
a
tiger
and
rushed
forward
ready
to
fire
the
dogs
were
endeavouring
to
enter
a
thicket
in
the
midst
of
which
fritz
declared
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
animal
larger
than
the
buffalo
with
a
black
bristly
skin
i
was
just
about
to
discharge
my
gun
into
the
thicket
when
jack
who
had
lain
down
on
the
ground
to
look
under
the
bushes
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
it
is
another
trick
of
that
vexatious
animal
our
old
sow
she
is
always
making
fools
of
us
cried
he
half
merry
and
half
angry
we
made
an
opening
into
the
thicket
and
there
discovered
the
lady
lying
surrounded
by
seven
little
pigs
only
a
few
days
old
we
were
very
glad
to
see
our
old
friend
so
attended
and
stroked
her
she
seemed
to
recognize
us
and
grunted
amicably
we
supplied
her
with
some
potatoes
sweet
acorns
and
cassava
bread
intending
in
return
to
eat
her
young
ones
when
they
were
ready
for
the
spit
though
my
dear
wife
cried
out
against
the
cruelty
of
the
idea
at
present
we
left
them
with
her
but
proposed
afterwards
to
take
away
two
to
be
brought
up
at
home
and
leave
the
rest
to
support
themselves
on
acorns
in
the
woods
where
they
would
become
game
for
us
at
length
we
arrived
at
falcon
nest
which
we
regarded
with
all
the
attachment
of
home
our
domestic
animals
crowded
round
us
and
noisily
welcomed
us
we
tied
up
the
buffalo
and
jackal
as
they
were
not
yet
domesticated
fritz
fastened
his
eagle
to
a
branch
by
a
chain
long
enough
to
allow
it
to
move
freely
and
then
imprudently
uncovered
its
eyes
it
immediately
raised
its
head
erected
its
feathers
and
struck
on
all
sides
with
its
beak
and
claws
our
fowls
took
to
flight
but
the
poor
parrot
fell
in
his
way
and
was
torn
to
pieces
before
we
could
assist
it
fritz
was
very
angry
and
would
have
executed
the
murderer
but
ernest
begged
he
would
not
be
so
rash
as
parrots
were
more
plentiful
than
eagles
and
it
was
his
own
fault
for
uncovering
his
eyes
the
falconers
always
keeping
their
young
birds
hooded
six
weeks
till
they
are
quite
tamed
he
offered
to
train
it
if
fritz
would
part
with
it
but
this
fritz
indignantly
refused
i
told
them
the
fable
of
the
dog
in
the
manger
which
abashed
fritz
and
he
then
besought
his
brother
to
teach
him
the
means
of
training
this
noble
bird
and
promised
to
present
him
with
his
monkey
ernest
then
told
him
that
the
caribs
subdue
the
largest
birds
by
making
them
inhale
tobacco
smoke
fritz
laughed
at
this
but
ernest
brought
a
pipe
and
some
tobacco
he
had
found
in
the
ship
and
began
to
smoke
gravely
under
the
branch
where
the
bird
was
perched
it
was
soon
calm
and
on
his
continuing
to
smoke
it
became
quite
motionless
fritz
then
easily
replaced
the
bandage
and
thanked
his
brother
for
his
good
service
the
next
morning
we
set
out
early
to
our
young
plantation
of
to
fix
props
to
support
the
weaker
plants
we
loaded
the
cart
with
the
thick
bamboo
canes
and
our
tools
and
harnessed
the
cow
to
it
leaving
the
buffalo
in
the
stable
as
i
wished
the
wound
in
his
nostrils
to
be
perfectly
healed
before
i
put
him
to
any
hard
work
i
left
francis
with
his
mother
to
prepare
our
dinner
begging
them
not
to
forget
the
maccaroni
we
began
at
the
entrance
of
the
avenue
to
falcon
nest
where
all
the
trees
were
much
bent
by
the
wind
we
raised
them
gently
by
a
crowbar
i
made
a
hole
in
the
earth
in
which
one
of
my
sons
placed
the
bamboo
props
driving
them
firmly
down
with
a
mallet
and
we
proceeded
to
another
while
ernest
and
jack
tied
the
trees
to
them
with
a
long
tough
pliant
plant
which
i
suspected
was
a
species
of
as
we
were
working
fritz
inquired
if
these
were
wild
a
pretty
question
cried
jack
do
you
think
that
trees
are
tamed
like
eagles
or
buffaloes
you
perhaps
could
teach
them
to
bow
politely
so
that
we
might
gather
the
fruit
you
fancy
you
are
a
wit
said
i
but
you
speak
like
a
dunce
we
can
not
make
trees
bow
at
our
pleasure
but
we
can
make
a
tree
which
by
nature
bears
sour
and
uneatable
fruit
produce
what
is
sweet
and
wholesome
this
is
effected
by
grafting
into
a
wild
tree
a
small
branch
or
even
a
bud
of
the
sort
you
wish
i
will
show
you
this
method
practically
at
some
future
time
for
by
these
means
we
can
procure
all
sorts
of
fruit
only
we
must
remember
that
we
can
only
graft
a
tree
with
one
of
the
same
natural
family
thus
we
could
not
graft
an
apple
on
a
for
one
belongs
to
the
apple
tribe
and
the
other
to
the
plum
tribe
do
we
know
the
origin
of
all
these
european
fruits
asked
the
inquiring
ernest
all
our
shell
fruits
answered
i
such
as
the
nut
the
almond
and
the
chesnut
are
natives
of
the
east
the
peach
of
persia
the
orange
and
apricot
of
armenia
the
cherry
which
was
unknown
in
europe
sixty
years
before
christ
was
brought
by
the
proconsul
lucullus
from
the
southern
shores
of
the
euxine
the
olives
come
from
palestine
the
first
were
planted
on
mount
olympus
and
from
thence
were
spread
through
the
rest
of
europe
the
fig
is
from
lydia
the
plums
your
favourite
fruit
with
the
exception
of
some
natural
sorts
that
are
natives
of
our
forests
are
from
syria
and
the
town
of
damascus
has
given
its
name
to
one
sort
the
or
damson
the
pear
is
a
fruit
of
greece
the
ancients
called
it
the
fruit
of
peloponnesus
the
mulberry
is
from
asia
and
the
quince
from
the
island
of
crete
our
work
progressed
as
we
talked
thus
and
we
had
soon
propped
all
our
valuable
plants
it
was
now
noon
and
we
returned
to
falcon
nest
very
hungry
and
found
an
excellent
dinner
prepared
of
smoked
beef
and
the
tender
bud
of
the
the
most
delicious
of
vegetables
after
dinner
we
began
to
discuss
a
plan
i
had
long
had
in
my
head
but
the
execution
of
it
presented
many
difficulties
it
was
to
substitute
a
firm
and
solid
staircase
for
the
ladder
of
ropes
which
was
a
source
of
continual
fear
to
my
wife
it
is
true
that
we
only
had
to
ascend
it
to
go
to
bed
but
bad
weather
might
compel
us
to
remain
in
our
apartment
we
should
then
have
frequently
to
ascend
and
descend
and
the
ladder
was
very
unsafe
but
the
immense
height
of
the
tree
and
the
impossibility
of
procuring
beams
to
sustain
a
staircase
round
it
threw
me
into
despair
however
looking
at
the
monstrous
trunk
of
the
tree
i
thought
if
we
can
not
succeed
outside
could
we
not
contrive
to
mount
within
have
you
not
said
there
was
a
swarm
of
bees
in
the
trunk
of
the
tree
i
inquired
of
my
wife
yes
said
little
francis
they
stung
my
face
dreadfully
the
other
day
when
i
was
on
the
ladder
i
was
pushing
a
stick
into
the
hole
they
came
out
of
to
try
how
deep
it
was
now
then
cried
i
i
see
through
my
difficulties
let
us
find
out
how
far
the
tree
is
hollow
we
can
increase
the
size
of
the
tunnel
and
i
have
already
planned
the
sort
of
staircase
i
can
construct
i
had
hardly
spoken
when
the
boys
leaped
like
squirrels
some
upon
the
arched
roots
some
on
the
steps
of
the
ladder
and
began
to
strike
with
sticks
and
mallets
to
sound
the
tree
this
rash
proceeding
had
nearly
been
fatal
to
jack
who
having
placed
himself
just
before
the
opening
and
striking
violently
the
whole
swarm
alarmed
at
an
attack
which
probably
shook
their
palace
of
wax
issued
forth
and
revenged
themselves
amply
on
all
the
assailants
nothing
was
heard
but
cries
and
stamping
of
feet
my
wife
hastened
to
cover
the
stings
with
moist
earth
which
rather
relieved
them
but
it
was
some
hours
before
they
could
open
their
eyes
they
begged
me
to
get
them
the
honey
from
their
foes
and
i
prepared
a
hive
which
i
had
long
thought
of
a
large
gourd
which
i
placed
on
a
board
nailed
upon
a
branch
of
our
tree
and
covered
with
straw
to
shelter
it
from
the
sun
and
wind
but
it
was
now
bedtime
and
we
deferred
our
attack
on
the
fortress
till
next
day
chapter
xxvi
an
hour
before
day
i
waked
my
sons
to
assist
me
in
removing
the
bees
to
the
new
abode
i
had
prepared
for
them
i
commenced
by
plastering
up
the
entrance
to
their
present
dwelling
with
clay
leaving
only
room
to
admit
the
bowl
of
my
pipe
this
was
necessary
because
i
had
neither
masks
nor
gloves
as
the
regular
have
i
then
began
to
smoke
briskly
to
stupify
the
bees
at
first
we
heard
a
great
buzzing
in
the
hollow
like
the
sound
of
a
distant
storm
the
murmur
ceased
by
degrees
and
a
profound
stillness
succeeded
and
i
withdrew
my
pipe
without
a
single
bee
appearing
fritz
and
i
then
with
a
chisel
and
small
axe
made
an
opening
about
three
feet
square
below
the
bees
entrance
before
we
detached
this
i
repeated
the
fumigation
lest
the
noise
and
the
fresh
air
should
awake
the
bees
but
there
was
no
fear
of
such
a
thing
they
were
quite
stupified
we
removed
the
wood
and
through
this
opening
beheld
with
wonder
and
admiration
the
work
of
this
insect
nation
there
was
such
a
store
of
wax
and
honey
that
we
feared
we
should
not
have
vessels
to
contain
it
the
interior
of
the
tree
was
filled
with
the
honeycombs
i
cut
them
carefully
and
placed
them
in
the
gourds
the
boys
brought
me
as
soon
as
i
had
made
a
little
space
i
placed
the
upper
comb
on
which
the
bees
were
hanging
in
clusters
in
the
new
hive
and
put
it
on
the
plank
prepared
for
it
i
then
descended
with
the
rest
of
the
honeycomb
and
filled
a
cask
with
it
which
i
had
previously
washed
in
the
stream
this
we
covered
with
sailcloth
and
planks
lest
the
bees
attracted
by
the
smell
should
come
to
claim
their
own
we
left
out
some
comb
for
a
treat
at
dinner
and
my
wife
carefully
put
by
the
rest
to
prevent
the
bees
returning
to
their
old
abode
we
placed
some
burning
tobacco
in
the
hollow
the
smell
and
fumes
of
which
drove
them
from
the
tree
when
they
wished
to
enter
and
finally
they
settled
in
the
new
hive
where
the
queen
bee
doubtless
had
fixed
herself
we
now
began
our
work
we
emptied
the
cask
of
honey
into
a
large
boiler
except
a
little
reserved
for
daily
use
we
added
a
little
water
placed
the
boiler
on
a
slow
fire
and
reduced
it
to
a
liquid
mass
this
was
strained
through
a
bag
into
the
cask
and
left
standing
all
night
to
cool
the
next
morning
the
wax
had
risen
to
the
top
and
formed
a
hard
and
solid
cake
which
we
easily
removed
and
beneath
was
the
most
pure
and
delicious
honey
the
barrel
was
then
carefully
closed
and
placed
in
a
cool
place
we
now
proceeded
to
examine
the
interior
of
the
tree
i
took
a
long
pole
and
tried
the
height
from
the
window
i
had
made
and
tied
a
stone
to
a
string
to
sound
the
depth
to
my
surprise
the
pole
penetrated
without
resistance
to
the
very
branches
where
our
dwelling
was
and
the
stone
went
to
the
roots
it
was
entirely
hollow
and
i
thought
i
could
easily
fix
a
winding
staircase
in
this
wide
tunnel
it
would
seem
that
this
huge
tree
like
the
willow
of
our
country
is
nourished
through
the
bark
for
it
was
flourishing
in
luxuriant
beauty
we
began
by
cutting
a
doorway
on
the
side
facing
the
sea
of
the
size
of
the
door
we
had
brought
from
the
captain
cabin
with
its
framework
thus
securing
ourselves
from
invasion
on
that
side
we
then
cleansed
and
perfectly
smoothed
the
cavity
fixing
in
the
middle
the
trunk
of
a
tree
about
ten
feet
high
to
serve
for
the
axis
of
the
staircase
we
had
prepared
the
evening
before
a
number
of
boards
from
the
staves
of
a
large
barrel
to
form
our
steps
by
the
aid
of
the
chisel
and
mallet
we
made
deep
notches
in
the
inner
part
of
our
tree
and
corresponding
notches
in
the
central
pillar
i
placed
my
steps
in
these
notches
riveting
them
with
large
nails
i
raised
myself
in
this
manner
step
after
step
but
always
turning
round
the
pillar
till
we
got
to
the
top
we
then
fixed
on
the
central
pillar
another
trunk
of
the
same
height
prepared
beforehand
and
continued
our
winding
steps
four
times
we
had
to
repeat
this
operation
and
finally
we
reached
our
branches
and
terminated
the
staircase
on
the
level
of
the
floor
of
our
apartment
i
cleared
the
entrance
by
some
strokes
of
my
axe
to
render
it
more
solid
i
filled
up
the
spaces
between
the
steps
with
planks
and
fastened
two
strong
cords
from
above
to
each
side
of
the
staircase
to
hold
by
towards
different
points
i
made
openings
in
which
were
placed
the
windows
taken
from
the
cabin
which
gave
light
to
the
interior
and
favoured
our
observations
outside
the
construction
of
this
solid
and
convenient
staircase
occupied
us
during
a
month
of
patient
industry
not
that
we
laboured
like
slaves
for
we
had
no
one
to
constrain
us
we
had
in
this
time
completed
several
works
of
less
importance
and
many
events
had
amused
us
amidst
our
toil
a
few
days
after
we
commenced
flora
produced
six
puppies
but
the
number
being
too
large
for
our
means
of
support
i
commanded
that
only
a
male
and
female
should
be
preserved
that
the
breed
might
be
perpetuated
this
was
done
and
the
little
jackal
being
placed
with
the
remainder
flora
gave
it
the
same
privileges
as
her
own
offspring
our
goats
also
about
this
time
gave
us
two
kids
and
our
sheep
some
lambs
we
saw
this
increase
of
our
flock
with
great
satisfaction
and
for
fear
these
useful
animals
should
take
it
into
their
heads
to
stray
from
us
as
our
ass
had
done
we
tied
round
their
necks
some
small
bells
we
had
found
on
the
wreck
intended
to
propitiate
the
savages
and
which
would
always
put
us
on
the
track
of
the
fugitives
the
education
of
the
young
buffalo
was
one
of
the
employments
that
varied
our
labour
as
carpenters
through
the
incision
in
his
nostrils
i
had
passed
a
small
stick
to
the
ends
of
which
i
attached
a
strap
this
formed
a
kind
of
bit
after
the
fashion
of
those
of
the
hottentots
and
by
this
i
guided
him
as
i
chose
though
not
without
much
rebellion
on
his
part
it
was
only
after
fritz
had
broken
it
in
for
mounting
that
we
began
to
make
it
carry
it
was
certainly
a
remarkable
instance
of
patience
and
perseverance
surmounting
difficulties
that
we
not
only
made
it
bear
the
wallets
we
usually
placed
on
the
ass
but
ernest
jack
and
even
little
francis
took
lessons
in
by
riding
him
and
henceforward
would
have
been
able
to
ride
the
most
spirited
horse
without
fear
for
it
could
not
be
worse
than
the
buffalo
they
had
assisted
to
subdue
in
the
midst
of
this
fritz
did
not
neglect
the
training
of
his
young
eagle
the
royal
bird
began
already
to
pounce
very
cleverly
on
the
dead
game
his
master
brought
and
placed
before
him
sometimes
between
the
horns
of
the
buffalo
sometimes
on
the
back
of
the
great
bustard
or
the
flamingo
sometimes
he
put
it
on
a
board
or
on
the
end
of
a
pole
to
accustom
it
to
pounce
like
the
falcon
on
other
birds
he
taught
it
to
settle
on
his
wrist
at
a
call
or
a
whistle
but
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
trust
it
to
fly
without
a
long
string
attached
to
its
leg
for
fear
its
wild
nature
should
carry
it
from
us
for
ever
even
the
indolent
ernest
was
seized
with
the
mania
of
instructing
animals
he
undertook
the
education
of
his
little
monkey
who
gave
him
sufficient
employment
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
quiet
slow
studious
ernest
obliged
to
make
leaps
and
gambols
with
his
pupil
to
accomplish
his
instruction
he
wished
to
accustom
master
knips
to
carry
a
pannier
and
to
climb
the
trees
with
it
on
his
back
jack
and
he
wove
a
small
light
pannier
of
rushes
and
fixed
it
firmly
on
his
back
with
three
straps
this
was
intolerable
to
him
at
first
he
ground
his
teeth
rolled
on
the
ground
and
leaped
about
in
a
frantic
manner
trying
in
vain
to
release
himself
they
left
the
pannier
on
his
back
night
and
day
and
only
allowed
him
to
eat
what
he
had
previously
put
into
it
after
a
little
time
he
became
so
accustomed
to
it
that
he
rebelled
if
they
wished
to
remove
it
and
threw
into
it
everything
they
gave
him
to
hold
he
was
very
useful
to
us
but
he
obeyed
only
ernest
who
had
very
properly
taught
him
equally
to
love
and
fear
him
jack
was
not
so
successful
with
his
jackal
for
though
he
gave
him
the
name
of
the
hunter
yet
for
the
first
six
months
the
carnivorous
animal
chased
only
for
himself
and
if
he
brought
anything
to
his
master
it
was
only
the
skin
of
the
animal
he
had
just
devoured
but
i
charged
him
not
to
despair
and
he
continued
zealously
his
instructions
during
this
time
i
had
perfected
my
candle
manufacture
by
means
of
mixing
the
bees
wax
with
that
obtained
from
the
and
by
using
cane
moulds
which
jack
first
suggested
to
me
i
succeeded
in
giving
my
candles
the
roundness
and
polish
of
those
of
europe
the
wicks
were
for
some
time
an
obstacle
i
did
not
wish
to
use
the
small
quantity
of
calico
we
had
left
but
my
wife
happily
proposed
to
me
to
substitute
the
pith
of
a
species
of
elder
which
answered
my
purpose
completely
i
now
turned
myself
to
the
preparation
of
the
caoutchouc
of
which
we
had
found
several
trees
i
encouraged
the
boys
to
try
their
ingenuity
in
making
flasks
and
cups
by
covering
moulds
of
clay
with
the
gum
as
i
had
explained
to
them
for
my
part
i
took
a
pair
of
old
stockings
and
filled
them
with
sand
for
my
mould
which
i
covered
with
a
coating
of
mud
and
left
to
dry
in
the
sun
i
cut
out
a
pair
of
soles
of
buffalo
leather
which
i
first
hammered
well
and
then
fastened
with
small
tacks
to
the
sole
of
the
stocking
filling
up
the
spaces
left
with
the
gum
so
as
to
fix
it
completely
then
with
a
brush
of
goats
hair
i
covered
it
with
layer
upon
layer
of
the
elastic
gum
till
i
thought
it
sufficiently
thick
it
was
easy
after
this
to
remove
the
sand
the
stocking
and
the
hardened
mud
to
shake
out
the
dust
and
i
had
a
pair
of
waterproof
boots
without
seam
and
fitting
as
well
as
if
i
had
employed
an
english
shoemaker
my
boys
were
wild
with
joy
and
all
begged
for
a
pair
but
i
wished
first
to
try
their
durability
compared
with
those
of
buffalo
leather
i
began
to
make
a
pair
of
boots
for
fritz
using
the
skin
drawn
from
the
legs
of
the
buffalo
we
had
killed
but
i
had
much
more
difficulty
than
with
the
caoutchouc
i
used
the
gum
to
cover
the
seams
so
that
the
water
might
not
penetrate
they
were
certainly
not
elegant
as
a
work
of
art
and
the
boys
laughed
at
their
brother
awkward
movements
in
them
but
their
own
productions
though
useful
vessels
were
not
models
of
perfection
we
then
worked
at
our
fountain
a
great
source
of
pleasure
to
my
wife
and
to
all
of
us
we
raised
in
the
upper
part
of
the
river
a
sort
of
dam
made
with
stakes
and
stones
from
whence
the
water
flowed
into
our
channels
of
the
laid
down
a
gentle
declivity
nearly
to
our
tent
and
there
it
was
received
into
the
shell
of
the
turtle
which
we
had
raised
on
some
stones
of
a
convenient
height
the
hole
which
the
harpoon
had
made
serving
to
carry
off
the
waste
water
through
a
cane
that
was
fitted
to
it
on
two
crossed
sticks
were
placed
the
gourds
that
served
us
for
pails
and
thus
we
had
always
the
murmuring
of
the
water
near
us
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
it
always
pure
and
clean
which
the
river
troubled
by
our
and
the
refuse
of
decayed
leaves
could
not
always
give
us
the
only
inconvenience
of
these
open
channels
was
that
the
water
reached
us
warm
and
unrefreshing
but
this
i
hoped
to
remedy
in
time
by
using
bamboo
pipes
buried
in
the
earth
in
the
mean
time
we
were
grateful
for
this
new
acquisition
and
gave
credit
to
fritz
who
had
suggested
the
idea
chapter
xxvii
one
morning
as
we
were
engaged
in
giving
the
last
finish
to
our
staircase
we
were
alarmed
at
hearing
at
a
distance
strange
sharp
prolonged
sounds
like
the
roars
of
a
wild
beast
but
mingled
with
an
unaccountable
hissing
our
dogs
erected
their
ears
and
prepared
for
deadly
combat
i
assembled
my
family
we
then
ascended
our
tree
closing
the
lower
door
loaded
our
guns
and
looked
anxiously
round
but
nothing
appeared
i
armed
my
dogs
with
their
porcupine
coats
of
mail
and
collars
and
left
them
below
to
take
care
of
our
animals
the
horrible
howlings
seemed
to
approach
nearer
to
us
at
length
fritz
who
was
leaning
forward
to
listen
as
attentively
as
he
could
threw
down
his
gun
and
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
cried
out
it
is
our
fugitive
the
ass
come
back
to
us
and
singing
his
song
of
joy
on
his
return
we
listened
and
were
sure
he
was
right
and
could
not
but
feel
a
little
vexation
at
being
put
into
such
a
fright
by
a
donkey
soon
after
we
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
appear
among
the
trees
and
what
was
still
better
he
was
accompanied
by
another
animal
of
his
own
species
but
infinitely
more
beautiful
i
knew
it
at
once
to
be
the
onagra
or
wild
ass
a
most
important
capture
if
we
could
make
it
though
all
naturalists
have
declared
it
impossible
to
tame
this
elegant
creature
yet
i
determined
to
make
the
attempt
i
went
down
with
fritz
exhorting
his
brothers
to
remain
quiet
and
i
consulted
with
my
privy
counsellor
on
the
means
of
taking
our
prize
i
also
prepared
as
quickly
as
possible
a
long
cord
with
a
noose
kept
open
by
a
slight
stick
which
would
fall
out
as
soon
as
the
head
entered
while
any
attempt
to
escape
would
only
draw
the
noose
closer
the
end
of
this
cord
was
tied
to
the
root
of
a
tree
i
took
then
a
piece
of
bamboo
about
two
feet
long
and
splitting
it
up
tied
it
firmly
at
one
end
to
form
a
pair
of
pincers
for
the
nose
of
the
animal
in
the
mean
time
the
two
animals
had
approached
nearer
our
old
grizzle
apparently
doing
the
honours
to
his
visitor
and
both
grazing
very
comfortably
by
degrees
we
advanced
softly
to
them
concealed
by
the
trees
fritz
carrying
the
lasso
and
i
the
pincers
the
onagra
as
soon
as
he
got
sight
of
fritz
who
was
before
me
raised
his
head
and
started
back
evidently
only
in
surprise
as
it
was
probably
the
first
man
the
creature
had
seen
fritz
remained
still
and
the
animal
resumed
his
browsing
fritz
went
up
to
our
old
servant
and
offered
him
a
handful
of
oats
mixed
with
salt
the
ass
came
directly
to
eat
its
favourite
treat
its
companion
followed
raised
its
head
snuffed
the
air
and
came
so
near
that
fritz
adroitly
threw
the
noose
over
its
head
the
terrified
animal
attempted
to
fly
but
that
drew
the
cord
so
tight
as
almost
to
stop
his
respiration
and
he
lay
down
his
tongue
hanging
out
i
hastened
up
and
relaxed
the
cord
lest
he
should
be
strangled
i
threw
the
halter
of
the
ass
round
his
neck
and
placed
the
split
cane
over
his
nose
tying
it
firmly
below
with
a
string
i
subdued
this
wild
animal
by
the
means
that
blacksmiths
use
the
first
time
they
shoe
a
horse
i
then
took
off
the
noose
and
tied
the
halter
by
two
long
cords
to
the
roots
of
two
separate
trees
and
left
him
to
recover
himself
in
the
mean
time
the
rest
of
the
family
had
collected
to
admire
this
noble
animal
whose
graceful
and
elegant
form
so
superior
to
that
of
the
ass
raises
it
almost
to
the
dignity
of
a
horse
after
a
while
it
rose
and
stamped
furiously
with
its
feet
trying
to
release
itself
but
the
pain
in
its
nose
obliged
it
to
lie
down
again
then
my
eldest
son
and
i
approaching
gently
took
the
two
cords
and
led
or
dragged
it
between
two
roots
very
near
to
each
other
to
which
we
tied
the
cords
so
short
that
it
had
little
power
to
move
and
could
not
escape
we
took
care
our
own
donkey
should
not
stray
again
by
tying
his
loosely
and
putting
on
him
a
new
halter
and
left
him
near
the
onagra
i
continued
with
a
patience
i
had
never
had
in
europe
to
use
every
means
i
could
think
of
with
our
new
guest
and
at
the
end
of
a
month
he
was
so
far
subdued
that
i
ventured
to
begin
his
education
this
was
a
long
and
difficult
task
we
placed
some
burdens
on
his
back
but
the
obedience
necessary
before
we
could
mount
him
it
seemed
impossible
to
instil
into
him
at
last
i
recollected
the
method
they
use
in
america
to
tame
the
wild
horses
and
i
resolved
to
try
it
in
spite
of
the
bounds
and
kicks
of
the
furious
animal
i
leaped
on
his
back
and
seizing
one
of
his
long
ears
between
my
teeth
i
bit
it
till
the
blood
came
in
a
moment
he
reared
himself
almost
erect
on
his
remained
for
a
while
stiff
and
motionless
then
came
down
on
his
slowly
i
still
holding
on
his
ear
at
last
i
ventured
to
release
him
he
made
some
leaps
but
soon
subsided
into
a
sort
of
trot
i
having
previously
placed
loose
cords
on
his
from
that
time
we
were
his
masters
my
sons
mounted
him
one
after
another
they
gave
him
the
name
of
lightfoot
and
never
animal
deserved
his
name
better
as
a
precaution
we
kept
the
cords
on
his
legs
for
some
time
and
as
he
never
would
submit
to
the
bit
we
used
a
snaffle
by
which
we
obtained
power
over
his
head
guiding
him
by
a
stick
with
which
we
struck
the
right
or
left
ear
as
we
wished
him
to
go
during
this
time
our
was
increased
by
three
broods
of
chickens
we
had
at
least
forty
of
these
little
creatures
chirping
and
pecking
about
the
pride
of
their
good
mistress
heart
part
of
these
were
kept
at
home
to
supply
the
table
and
part
she
allowed
to
colonize
in
the
woods
where
we
could
find
them
when
we
wanted
them
these
she
said
are
of
more
use
than
your
monkeys
jackals
and
eagles
who
do
nothing
but
eat
and
would
not
be
worth
eating
themselves
if
we
were
in
need
however
she
allowed
there
was
some
use
in
the
buffalo
who
carried
burdens
and
lightfoot
who
carried
her
sons
so
well
the
fowls
which
cost
us
little
for
food
would
be
always
ready
she
said
either
to
supply
us
with
eggs
or
chickens
when
the
rainy
season
came
on
the
winter
of
this
climate
this
reminded
me
that
the
approach
of
that
dreary
season
permitted
me
no
longer
to
defer
a
very
necessary
work
for
the
protection
of
our
animals
this
was
to
construct
under
the
roots
of
the
trees
covered
houses
for
them
we
began
by
making
a
kind
of
roof
above
the
vaulted
roots
of
our
tree
we
used
bamboo
canes
for
this
purpose
the
longer
and
stouter
were
used
for
the
supports
like
columns
the
slighter
ones
bound
together
closely
formed
the
roof
the
intervals
we
filled
up
with
moss
and
clay
and
spread
over
the
whole
a
coating
of
tar
the
roof
was
so
firm
that
it
formed
a
platform
which
we
surrounded
with
a
railing
and
thus
we
had
a
balcony
and
a
pleasant
promenade
by
the
aid
of
some
boards
nailed
to
the
roots
we
made
several
divisions
in
the
interior
each
little
enclosure
being
appropriated
to
some
useful
purpose
and
thus
stables
dairy
larder
besides
our
were
all
united
under
one
roof
this
occupied
us
some
time
as
it
was
necessary
to
fill
our
before
the
bad
weather
came
and
our
cart
was
constantly
employed
in
bringing
useful
stores
one
evening
as
we
were
bringing
home
a
load
of
potatoes
on
our
cart
drawn
by
the
ass
the
cow
and
the
buffalo
i
saw
the
cart
was
not
yet
full
i
therefore
sent
home
the
two
younger
boys
with
their
mother
and
went
on
with
fritz
and
ernest
to
the
oak
wood
to
collect
a
sack
of
sweet
acorns
fritz
mounted
on
his
onagra
ernest
followed
by
his
monkey
and
i
carrying
the
bag
on
arriving
at
the
wood
we
tied
lightfoot
to
a
tree
and
all
three
began
to
gather
the
dropped
acorns
when
we
were
startled
by
the
cries
of
birds
and
a
loud
flapping
of
wings
and
we
concluded
that
a
brisk
combat
was
going
on
between
master
knips
and
the
tenants
of
the
thickets
from
whence
the
noise
came
ernest
went
softly
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
we
soon
heard
him
calling
out
be
quick
a
fine
nest
full
of
eggs
knips
wants
to
suck
them
and
the
mother
is
beating
him
fritz
ran
up
and
secured
the
two
beautiful
birds
who
fluttered
and
cried
out
furiously
and
returned
followed
by
ernest
carrying
a
large
nest
filled
with
eggs
the
monkey
had
served
us
well
on
this
occasion
for
the
nest
was
so
hidden
by
a
bush
with
long
leaves
of
which
ernest
held
his
hand
full
that
but
for
the
instinct
of
the
animal
we
could
never
have
discovered
it
ernest
was
overjoyed
to
carry
the
nest
and
eggs
for
his
dear
mamma
and
the
long
pointed
leaves
he
intended
for
francis
to
serve
as
little
we
set
out
on
our
return
placing
the
sack
of
acorns
behind
fritz
on
lightfoot
ernest
carried
the
two
fowls
and
i
charged
myself
with
the
care
of
the
eggs
which
i
covered
up
as
i
found
they
were
warm
and
i
hoped
to
get
the
mother
to
resume
her
brooding
when
we
got
to
nest
we
were
all
delighted
with
the
good
news
we
should
have
to
carry
home
and
fritz
anxious
to
be
first
struck
his
charger
with
a
bunch
of
the
pointed
leaves
he
had
taken
from
ernest
this
terrified
the
animal
so
much
that
he
took
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
flew
out
of
sight
like
an
arrow
we
followed
in
some
uneasiness
but
found
him
safe
master
lightfoot
had
stopped
of
himself
when
he
reached
his
stable
my
wife
placed
the
valuable
eggs
under
a
sitting
hen
the
true
mother
refusing
to
fulfil
her
office
she
was
then
put
into
the
cage
of
the
poor
parrot
and
hung
in
our
to
accustom
her
to
society
in
a
few
days
the
eggs
were
hatched
and
the
had
an
increase
of
fifteen
little
strangers
who
fed
greedily
on
bruised
acorns
and
soon
became
as
tame
as
any
of
our
fowls
though
i
plucked
the
large
feathers
out
of
their
wings
when
they
were
lest
their
wild
nature
should
tempt
them
to
quit
us
chapter
xxviii
francis
had
soon
become
tired
of
playing
with
the
long
leaves
his
brother
had
brought
him
and
they
were
thrown
aside
fritz
happened
to
take
some
of
the
withered
leaves
up
which
were
soft
and
flexible
as
a
ribbon
and
he
advised
francis
to
make
whiplashes
of
them
to
drive
the
goats
and
sheep
with
for
the
little
fellow
was
the
shepherd
he
was
pleased
with
the
idea
and
began
to
split
the
leaves
into
strips
which
fritz
platted
together
into
very
good
whiplashes
i
remarked
as
they
were
working
how
strong
and
pliant
these
strips
seemed
and
examining
them
closely
i
found
they
were
composed
of
long
fibres
or
filaments
which
made
me
suspect
it
to
be
tenax
or
new
zealand
flax
a
most
important
discovery
to
us
and
which
when
i
communicated
it
to
my
wife
almost
overwhelmed
her
with
joy
bring
me
all
the
leaves
you
can
without
delay
cried
she
and
i
will
make
you
stockings
shirts
coats
cords
in
fact
give
me
but
flax
and
and
i
can
manage
all
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
vivacity
of
her
imagination
roused
at
the
very
name
of
flax
but
there
was
still
great
space
between
the
leaves
lying
before
us
and
the
linen
she
was
already
sewing
in
idea
but
my
boys
always
ready
to
second
the
wishes
of
their
beloved
mother
soon
mounted
their
coursers
fritz
on
lightfoot
and
jack
on
the
great
buffalo
to
procure
supplies
whilst
we
waited
for
these
my
wife
all
life
and
animation
explained
to
me
all
the
machines
i
must
make
to
enable
her
to
spin
and
weave
and
make
linen
to
clothe
us
from
head
to
foot
her
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
as
she
spoke
and
i
promised
her
all
she
asked
in
a
short
time
our
young
cavaliers
returned
from
their
foraging
expedition
conveying
on
their
steeds
huge
bundles
of
the
precious
plant
which
they
laid
at
the
feet
of
their
mother
she
gave
up
everything
to
begin
her
preparation
the
first
operation
necessary
was
to
steep
the
flax
which
is
usually
done
by
exposing
it
in
the
open
air
in
the
rain
the
wind
and
the
dew
so
as
in
a
certain
degree
to
dissolve
the
plant
rendering
the
separation
of
the
fibrous
and
ligneous
parts
more
easy
it
can
then
be
cleaned
and
picked
for
spinning
but
as
the
vegetable
glue
that
connects
the
two
parts
is
very
tenacious
and
resists
for
a
long
time
the
action
of
moisture
it
is
often
advisable
to
steep
it
in
water
and
this
in
our
dry
climate
i
considered
most
expedient
my
wife
agreed
to
this
and
proposed
that
we
should
convey
it
to
flamingo
marsh
and
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
tying
up
the
leaves
in
bundles
next
morning
we
loaded
our
cart
and
proceeded
to
the
marsh
we
there
untied
our
bundles
and
spread
them
in
the
water
pressing
them
down
with
stones
and
leaving
them
till
it
was
time
to
take
them
out
to
dry
we
could
not
but
admire
here
the
ingenious
nests
of
the
flamingo
they
are
of
a
conical
form
raised
above
the
level
of
the
marsh
having
a
recess
above
in
which
the
eggs
are
deposited
out
of
the
reach
of
danger
and
the
female
can
sit
on
them
with
her
legs
in
the
water
these
nests
are
of
clay
and
so
solid
that
they
resist
the
water
till
the
young
are
able
to
swim
in
a
fortnight
the
flax
was
ready
to
be
taken
out
of
the
water
we
spread
it
in
the
sun
which
dried
it
so
effectually
that
we
brought
it
to
falcon
nest
the
same
evening
where
it
was
stored
till
we
were
ready
for
further
operations
at
present
we
laboured
to
lay
up
provision
for
the
rainy
season
leaving
all
sedentary
occupations
to
amuse
us
in
our
confinement
we
brought
in
continually
loads
of
sweet
acorns
manioc
potatoes
wood
fodder
for
the
cattle
fruit
indeed
everything
that
might
be
useful
during
the
uncertain
period
of
the
rainy
season
we
profited
by
the
last
few
days
to
sow
the
wheat
and
other
remaining
european
grains
that
the
rain
might
germinate
them
we
had
already
had
some
showers
the
temperature
was
variable
the
sky
became
cloudy
and
the
wind
rose
the
season
changed
sooner
than
we
expected
the
winds
raged
through
the
woods
the
sea
roared
mountains
of
clouds
were
piled
in
the
heavens
they
soon
burst
over
our
heads
and
torrents
of
rain
fell
night
and
day
without
intermission
the
rivers
swelled
till
their
waters
met
and
turned
the
whole
country
around
us
into
an
immense
lake
happily
we
had
formed
our
little
establishment
on
a
spot
rather
elevated
above
the
rest
of
the
valley
the
waters
did
not
quite
reach
our
tree
but
surrounded
us
about
two
hundred
yards
off
leaving
us
on
a
sort
of
island
in
the
midst
of
the
general
inundation
we
were
reluctantly
obliged
to
descend
from
our
aërial
abode
the
rain
entered
it
on
all
sides
and
the
hurricane
threatened
every
moment
to
carry
away
the
apartment
and
all
that
were
in
it
we
set
about
our
removal
bringing
down
our
hammocks
and
bedding
to
the
sheltered
space
under
the
roots
of
the
trees
that
we
had
roofed
for
the
animals
we
were
painfully
crowded
in
the
small
space
the
stores
of
provisions
the
and
especially
the
neighbourhood
of
the
animals
and
the
various
offensive
smells
made
our
retreat
almost
insupportable
we
were
choked
with
smoke
if
we
lighted
a
fire
and
inundated
with
rain
if
we
opened
a
door
for
the
first
time
since
our
misfortune
we
sighed
for
the
comforts
of
our
native
home
but
action
was
necessary
and
we
set
about
endeavouring
to
amend
our
condition
the
winding
staircase
was
very
useful
to
us
the
upper
part
was
crowded
with
things
we
did
not
want
and
my
wife
frequently
worked
in
the
lower
part
at
one
of
the
windows
we
crowded
our
beasts
a
little
more
and
gave
a
current
of
air
to
the
places
they
had
left
i
placed
outside
the
enclosure
the
animals
of
the
country
which
could
bear
the
inclemency
of
the
season
thus
i
gave
a
to
the
buffalo
and
the
onagra
tying
their
legs
loosely
to
prevent
them
straying
the
boughs
of
the
tree
affording
them
a
shelter
we
made
as
few
fires
as
possible
as
fortunately
it
was
never
cold
and
we
had
no
provisions
that
required
a
long
process
of
cookery
we
had
milk
in
abundance
smoked
meat
and
fish
the
preserved
ortolans
and
cassava
cakes
as
we
sent
out
some
of
our
animals
in
the
morning
with
bells
round
their
necks
fritz
and
i
had
to
seek
them
and
bring
them
in
every
evening
when
we
were
invariably
wet
through
this
induced
my
ingenious
elizabeth
to
make
us
a
sort
of
blouse
and
hood
out
of
old
garments
of
the
sailors
which
we
covered
with
coatings
of
the
caoutchouc
and
thus
obtained
two
capital
waterproof
dresses
all
that
the
exhausted
state
of
our
gum
permitted
us
to
make
the
care
of
our
animals
occupied
us
a
great
part
of
the
morning
then
we
prepared
our
cassava
and
baked
our
cakes
on
iron
plates
though
we
had
a
glazed
door
to
our
hut
the
gloominess
of
the
weather
and
the
obscurity
caused
by
the
vast
boughs
of
the
tree
made
night
come
on
early
we
then
lighted
a
candle
fixed
in
a
gourd
on
the
table
round
which
we
were
all
assembled
the
good
mother
laboured
with
her
needle
mending
the
clothes
i
wrote
my
journal
which
ernest
copied
as
he
wrote
a
beautiful
hand
while
fritz
and
jack
taught
their
young
brother
to
read
and
write
or
amused
themselves
with
drawing
the
animals
or
plants
they
had
been
struck
with
we
read
the
lessons
from
the
bible
in
turns
and
concluded
the
evening
with
devotion
we
then
retired
to
rest
content
with
ourselves
and
with
our
innocent
and
peaceful
life
our
kind
housekeeper
often
made
us
a
little
feast
of
a
roast
chicken
a
pigeon
or
a
duck
and
once
in
four
or
five
days
we
had
fresh
butter
made
in
the
gourd
churn
and
the
delicious
honey
which
we
ate
to
our
cassava
bread
might
have
been
a
treat
to
european
epicures
the
remains
of
our
repast
was
always
divided
among
our
domestic
animals
we
had
four
dogs
the
jackal
the
eagle
and
the
monkey
who
relied
on
their
masters
and
were
never
neglected
but
if
the
buffalo
the
onagra
and
the
sow
had
not
been
able
to
provide
for
themselves
we
must
have
killed
them
for
we
had
no
food
for
them
we
now
decided
that
we
would
not
expose
ourselves
to
another
rainy
season
in
such
an
unsuitable
habitation
even
my
gentle
elizabeth
got
out
of
temper
with
the
inconveniences
and
begged
we
would
build
a
better
winter
house
stipulating
however
that
we
should
return
to
our
tree
in
summer
we
consulted
a
great
deal
on
this
matter
fritz
quoted
robinson
crusoe
who
had
cut
a
dwelling
out
of
the
rock
which
sheltered
him
in
the
inclement
season
and
the
idea
of
making
our
home
at
tent
house
naturally
came
into
my
mind
it
would
probably
be
a
long
and
difficult
undertaking
but
with
time
patience
and
perseverance
we
might
work
wonders
we
resolved
as
soon
as
the
weather
would
allow
us
to
go
and
examine
the
rocks
at
tent
house
the
last
work
of
the
winter
was
at
my
wife
incessant
request
a
beetle
for
her
flax
and
some
the
beetle
was
easily
made
but
the
combs
cost
much
trouble
i
filed
large
nails
till
they
were
round
and
pointed
i
fixed
them
slightly
inclined
at
equal
distances
in
a
sheet
of
tin
and
raised
the
edge
like
a
box
i
then
poured
melted
lead
between
the
nails
and
the
edge
to
fix
them
more
firmly
i
nailed
this
on
a
board
and
the
machine
was
fit
for
use
and
my
wife
was
all
anxiety
to
begin
her
manufacture
chapter
xxix
i
can
not
describe
our
delight
when
after
long
and
gloomy
weeks
we
saw
at
length
the
sky
clear
and
the
sun
dispersing
the
dark
clouds
of
winter
spread
its
vivifying
rays
over
all
nature
the
winds
were
lulled
the
waters
subsided
and
the
air
became
mild
and
serene
we
went
out
with
shouts
of
joy
to
breathe
the
balmy
air
and
gratified
our
eyes
with
the
sight
of
the
fresh
verdure
already
springing
up
around
us
nature
seemed
in
her
youth
again
and
amidst
the
charms
that
breathed
on
every
side
we
forgot
our
sufferings
and
like
the
children
of
noah
coming
forth
from
the
ark
we
raised
a
hymn
of
thanksgiving
to
the
giver
of
all
good
all
our
plantations
and
seeds
had
prospered
the
corn
was
springing
and
the
trees
were
covered
with
leaves
and
blossoms
the
air
was
perfumed
with
the
odour
of
countless
beautiful
flowers
and
lively
with
the
songs
and
cries
of
hundreds
of
brilliant
birds
all
busy
building
their
nests
this
was
really
spring
in
all
its
glory
we
began
our
summer
occupation
by
cleaning
and
putting
in
order
our
dormitory
in
the
tree
which
the
rain
and
the
scattered
leaves
had
greatly
deranged
and
in
a
few
days
we
were
able
to
inhabit
it
again
my
wife
immediately
began
with
her
flax
while
my
sons
were
leading
the
cattle
to
the
pasture
i
took
the
bundles
of
flax
into
the
open
air
where
i
constructed
a
sort
of
oven
of
stone
which
dried
it
completely
we
began
that
very
evening
to
strip
beat
and
comb
it
and
i
drew
out
such
handfuls
of
soft
fine
flax
ready
for
spinning
that
my
wife
was
overjoyed
and
begged
me
to
make
her
a
wheel
that
she
might
commence
i
had
formerly
had
a
little
taste
for
turning
and
though
i
had
now
neither
lathe
nor
any
other
of
the
tools
yet
i
knew
how
a
and
reel
should
be
made
and
by
dint
of
application
i
succeeded
in
completing
these
two
machines
to
her
satisfaction
she
began
to
spin
with
so
much
earnestness
that
she
would
hardly
take
a
walk
and
reluctantly
left
her
wheel
to
make
dinner
ready
she
employed
francis
to
reel
off
the
thread
as
she
spun
it
and
would
willingly
have
had
the
elder
boys
to
take
her
place
when
she
was
called
off
but
they
rebelled
at
the
effeminate
work
except
ernest
whose
indolent
habits
made
him
prefer
it
to
more
laborious
occupation
in
the
mean
time
we
walked
over
to
tent
house
to
see
the
state
of
things
and
found
that
winter
had
done
more
damage
there
than
at
falcon
nest
the
storm
had
overthrown
the
tent
carried
away
some
of
the
sailcloth
and
injured
our
provisions
so
much
that
great
part
was
good
for
nothing
and
the
rest
required
to
be
immediately
dried
fortunately
our
beautiful
pinnace
had
not
suffered
much
it
was
still
safe
at
anchor
and
fit
for
use
but
our
tub
boat
was
entirely
destroyed
our
most
important
loss
was
two
barrels
of
gunpowder
which
had
been
left
in
the
tent
instead
of
under
the
shelter
of
the
rock
and
which
the
rain
had
rendered
wholly
useless
this
made
us
feel
still
more
strongly
the
necessity
of
securing
for
the
future
a
more
suitable
shelter
than
a
canvas
tent
or
a
roof
of
foliage
still
i
had
small
hope
from
the
gigantic
plan
of
fritz
or
the
boldness
of
jack
i
could
not
be
blind
to
the
difficulties
of
the
undertaking
the
rocks
which
surrounded
tent
house
presented
an
unbroken
surface
like
a
wall
without
any
crevice
and
to
all
appearance
of
so
hard
a
nature
as
to
leave
little
hopes
of
success
however
it
was
necessary
to
try
to
contrive
some
sort
of
cave
if
only
for
our
gunpowder
i
made
up
my
mind
and
selected
the
most
perpendicular
face
of
the
rock
as
the
place
to
begin
our
work
it
was
a
much
pleasanter
situation
than
our
tent
commanding
a
view
of
the
whole
bay
and
the
two
banks
of
jackal
river
with
its
picturesque
bridge
i
marked
out
with
chalk
the
dimension
of
the
entrance
i
wished
to
give
to
the
cave
then
my
sons
and
i
took
our
chisels
pickaxes
and
heavy
miner
hammers
and
began
boldly
to
hew
the
stone
our
first
blows
produced
very
little
effect
the
rock
seemed
impenetrable
the
sun
had
so
hardened
the
surface
and
the
sweat
poured
off
our
brows
with
the
hard
labour
nevertheless
the
efforts
of
my
young
workmen
did
not
relax
every
evening
we
left
our
work
advanced
perhaps
a
few
inches
and
every
morning
returned
to
the
task
with
renewed
ardour
at
the
end
of
five
or
six
days
when
the
surface
of
the
rock
was
removed
we
found
the
stone
become
easier
to
work
it
then
seemed
calcarious
and
finally
only
a
sort
of
hardened
clay
which
we
could
remove
with
spades
and
we
began
to
hope
after
a
few
days
more
labour
we
found
we
had
advanced
about
seven
feet
fritz
wheeled
out
the
rubbish
and
formed
a
sort
of
terrace
with
it
before
the
opening
while
i
was
working
at
the
higher
part
jack
as
the
least
worked
below
one
morning
he
was
hammering
an
iron
bar
which
he
had
pointed
at
the
end
into
the
rock
to
loosen
the
earth
when
he
suddenly
cried
out
papa
papa
i
have
pierced
through
not
through
your
hand
child
asked
i
no
papa
cried
he
i
have
pierced
through
the
mountain
huzza
fritz
ran
in
at
the
shout
and
told
him
he
had
better
have
said
at
once
that
he
had
pierced
through
the
earth
but
jack
persisted
that
however
his
brother
might
laugh
he
was
quite
sure
he
had
felt
his
iron
bar
enter
an
empty
space
behind
i
now
came
down
from
my
ladder
and
moving
the
bar
i
felt
there
was
really
a
hollow
into
which
the
rubbish
fell
but
apparently
very
little
below
the
level
we
were
working
on
i
took
a
long
pole
and
probed
the
cavity
and
found
that
it
must
be
of
considerable
size
my
boys
wished
to
have
the
opening
enlarged
and
to
enter
immediately
but
this
i
strictly
forbade
for
as
i
leaned
forward
to
examine
it
through
the
opening
a
rush
of
mephitic
air
gave
me
a
sort
of
vertigo
come
away
children
cried
i
in
terror
the
air
you
would
breathe
there
is
certain
death
i
explained
to
them
that
under
certain
circumstances
carbonic
acid
gas
was
frequently
accumulated
in
caves
or
grottoes
rendering
the
air
unfit
for
respiration
producing
giddiness
of
the
head
fainting
and
eventually
death
i
sent
them
to
collect
some
hay
which
i
lighted
and
threw
into
the
cave
this
was
immediately
extinguished
we
repeated
the
experiment
several
times
with
the
same
result
i
now
saw
that
more
active
means
must
be
resorted
to
we
had
brought
from
the
vessel
a
box
of
fireworks
intended
for
signals
i
threw
into
the
cave
by
a
cord
a
quantity
of
rockets
grenades
and
scattered
a
train
of
gunpowder
from
them
to
this
i
applied
a
long
match
and
we
retired
to
a
little
distance
this
succeeded
well
a
great
explosion
agitated
the
air
a
torrent
of
the
carbonic
acid
gas
rushed
through
the
opening
and
was
replaced
by
the
pure
air
we
sent
in
a
few
more
rockets
which
flew
round
like
fiery
dragons
disclosing
to
us
the
vast
extent
of
the
cave
a
shower
of
stars
which
concluded
our
experiment
made
us
wish
the
duration
had
been
longer
it
seemed
as
if
a
crowd
of
winged
genii
carrying
each
a
lamp
were
floating
about
in
that
enchanted
cavern
when
they
vanished
i
threw
in
some
more
lighted
hay
which
blazed
in
such
a
lively
manner
that
i
knew
all
danger
was
over
from
the
gas
but
for
fear
of
deep
pits
or
pools
of
water
i
would
not
venture
in
without
lights
i
therefore
despatched
jack
on
his
buffalo
to
report
this
discovery
to
his
mother
and
bring
all
the
candles
she
had
made
i
purposely
sent
jack
on
the
errand
for
his
lively
and
poetic
turn
of
mind
would
i
hoped
invest
the
grotto
with
such
charms
that
his
mother
would
even
abandon
her
wheel
to
come
and
see
it
illustration
this
succeeded
well
a
great
explosion
agitated
the
air
a
torrent
of
the
carbonic
acid
gas
rushed
through
the
opening
delighted
with
his
commission
jack
leaped
upon
his
buffalo
and
waving
his
whip
galloped
off
with
an
intrepidity
that
made
my
hair
stand
on
end
during
his
absence
fritz
and
i
enlarged
the
opening
to
make
it
easy
of
access
removed
all
the
rubbish
and
swept
a
road
for
mamma
we
had
just
finished
when
we
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
crossing
the
bridge
and
the
cart
appeared
drawn
by
the
cow
and
ass
led
by
ernest
jack
rode
before
on
his
buffalo
blowing
through
his
hand
to
imitate
a
horn
and
whipping
the
lazy
cow
and
ass
he
rode
up
first
and
alighted
from
his
huge
courser
to
help
his
mother
out
i
then
lighted
our
candles
giving
one
to
each
with
a
spare
candle
and
flint
and
steel
in
our
pockets
we
took
our
arms
and
proceeded
in
a
solemn
manner
into
the
rock
i
walked
first
my
sons
followed
and
their
mother
came
last
with
francis
we
had
not
gone
on
above
a
few
steps
when
we
stopped
struck
with
wonder
and
admiration
all
was
glittering
around
us
we
were
in
a
grotto
of
diamonds
from
the
height
of
the
lofty
vaulted
roof
hung
innumerable
crystals
which
uniting
with
those
on
the
walls
formed
colonnades
altars
and
every
sort
of
gothic
ornament
of
dazzling
lustre
creating
a
fairy
palace
or
an
illuminated
temple
when
we
were
a
little
recovered
from
our
first
astonishment
we
advanced
with
more
confidence
the
grotto
was
spacious
the
floor
smooth
and
covered
with
a
fine
dry
sand
from
the
appearance
of
these
crystals
i
suspected
their
nature
and
on
breaking
off
a
piece
and
tasting
it
i
found
to
my
great
joy
that
we
were
in
a
grotto
of
rock
salt
which
is
found
in
large
masses
in
the
earth
usually
above
a
bed
of
gypsum
and
surrounded
by
fossils
we
were
charmed
with
this
discovery
of
which
we
could
no
longer
have
a
doubt
what
an
advantage
this
was
to
our
cattle
and
to
ourselves
we
could
now
procure
this
precious
commodity
without
care
or
labour
the
acquisition
was
almost
as
valuable
as
this
brilliant
retreat
was
in
itself
of
which
we
were
never
tired
of
admiring
the
beauty
my
wife
was
struck
with
our
good
fortune
in
opening
the
rock
precisely
at
the
right
spot
but
i
was
of
opinion
that
this
mine
was
of
great
extent
and
that
we
could
not
well
have
missed
it
some
blocks
of
salt
were
scattered
on
the
ground
which
had
apparently
fallen
from
the
vaulted
roof
i
was
alarmed
for
such
an
accident
might
destroy
one
of
my
children
but
on
examination
i
found
the
mass
above
too
solid
to
be
detached
spontaneously
and
i
concluded
that
the
explosion
of
the
fireworks
had
given
this
shock
to
the
subterranean
palace
which
had
not
been
entered
since
the
creation
of
the
world
i
feared
there
might
yet
be
some
pieces
loosened
i
therefore
sent
out
my
wife
and
younger
sons
fritz
and
i
remained
and
after
carefully
examining
the
suspected
parts
we
fired
our
guns
and
watched
the
effect
one
or
two
pieces
fell
but
the
rest
remained
firm
though
we
struck
with
long
poles
as
high
as
we
could
reach
we
were
now
satisfied
of
the
security
of
our
magnificent
abode
and
began
to
plan
our
arrangements
for
converting
it
into
a
convenient
and
pleasant
habitation
the
majority
were
for
coming
here
immediately
but
the
wiser
heads
determined
that
for
this
year
falcon
nest
was
to
continue
our
home
there
we
went
every
night
and
spent
the
day
at
tent
house
contriving
and
arranging
our
future
winter
dwelling
chapter
xxx
the
last
bed
of
rock
before
we
reached
the
cave
which
jack
had
pierced
was
so
soft
and
easy
to
work
that
we
had
little
difficulty
in
proportioning
and
opening
the
place
for
our
door
i
hoped
that
being
now
exposed
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
it
would
soon
become
as
hard
as
the
original
surface
the
door
was
that
we
had
used
for
the
staircase
at
falcon
nest
for
as
we
only
intended
to
make
a
temporary
residence
of
our
old
tree
there
was
no
necessity
for
solid
fittings
and
besides
i
intended
to
close
the
entrance
of
the
tree
by
a
door
of
bark
more
effectually
to
conceal
it
in
case
savages
should
visit
us
i
then
laid
out
the
extent
of
the
grotto
at
pleasure
for
we
had
ample
space
we
began
by
dividing
it
into
two
parts
that
on
the
right
of
the
entrance
was
to
be
our
dwelling
on
the
left
were
first
our
kitchen
then
the
workshop
and
the
stables
behind
these
were
the
and
the
cellar
in
order
to
give
light
and
air
to
our
apartments
it
was
necessary
to
insert
in
the
rock
the
windows
we
had
brought
from
the
ship
and
this
cost
us
many
days
of
labour
the
portion
was
subdivided
into
three
rooms
the
first
our
own
bedroom
the
middle
the
common
and
beyond
the
boys
room
as
we
had
only
three
windows
we
appropriated
one
to
each
bedroom
and
the
third
to
the
kitchen
contenting
ourselves
at
present
with
a
grating
in
the
i
constructed
a
sort
of
chimney
in
the
kitchen
formed
of
four
boards
and
conducted
the
smoke
thus
through
a
hole
made
in
the
face
of
the
rock
we
made
bur
spacious
enough
for
us
to
carry
on
all
our
manufactures
and
it
served
also
for
our
finally
all
the
were
put
up
communicating
by
doors
and
completing
our
commodious
habitation
these
various
labours
the
removal
of
our
effects
and
arranging
them
again
all
the
confusion
of
a
change
when
it
was
necessary
to
be
at
once
workmen
and
directors
took
us
a
great
part
of
summer
but
the
recollection
of
the
vexations
we
should
escape
in
the
rainy
season
gave
us
energy
we
passed
nearly
all
our
time
at
tent
house
the
centre
of
our
operations
and
besides
the
gardens
and
plantations
which
surrounded
it
we
found
many
advantages
which
we
profited
by
large
turtles
often
came
to
deposit
their
eggs
in
the
sand
a
pleasant
treat
for
us
but
we
raised
our
desires
to
the
possession
of
the
turtles
themselves
living
to
eat
when
we
chose
as
soon
as
we
saw
one
on
the
shore
one
of
my
sons
ran
to
cut
off
its
retreat
we
then
hastened
to
assist
turned
the
creature
on
its
back
passed
a
long
cord
through
its
shell
and
tied
it
firmly
to
a
post
close
to
the
water
we
then
placed
it
on
its
legs
when
of
course
it
made
for
the
water
but
could
only
ramble
the
length
of
its
cord
it
seemed
however
very
content
and
we
had
it
in
readiness
when
we
wanted
it
the
lobsters
crabs
muscles
and
every
sort
of
fish
which
abounded
on
the
coast
plentifully
supplied
our
table
one
morning
we
were
struck
with
an
extraordinary
spectacle
a
large
portion
of
the
sea
appeared
in
a
state
of
ebullition
and
immense
flocks
of
marine
birds
were
hovering
over
it
uttering
piercing
cries
and
plunging
into
the
waves
from
time
to
time
the
surface
on
which
the
rising
sun
now
shone
seemed
covered
with
little
flames
which
rapidly
appeared
and
vanished
suddenly
this
extraordinary
mass
advanced
to
the
bay
and
we
ran
down
fall
of
curiosity
we
found
on
our
arrival
that
this
strange
phenomenon
was
caused
by
a
shoal
of
herrings
these
shoals
are
so
dense
that
they
are
often
taken
for
are
many
leagues
in
extent
and
several
feet
in
depth
they
spread
themselves
over
the
seas
carrying
to
barren
shores
the
resources
that
nature
has
denied
them
these
brilliant
scaly
creatures
had
now
entered
the
bay
and
my
wife
and
children
were
lost
in
admiration
of
the
wonderful
sight
but
i
reminded
them
that
when
providence
sends
plenty
we
ought
to
put
forth
our
hands
to
take
it
i
sent
immediately
for
the
necessary
utensils
and
organized
my
fishery
fritz
and
jack
stood
in
the
water
and
such
was
the
thickness
of
the
shoal
that
they
filled
baskets
taking
them
up
as
you
would
water
in
a
pail
they
threw
them
on
the
sand
my
wife
and
ernest
cut
them
open
cleaned
them
and
rubbed
them
with
salt
i
arranged
them
in
small
barrels
a
layer
of
herrings
and
a
layer
of
salt
and
when
the
barrel
was
full
the
ass
led
by
francis
took
them
up
to
the
storehouse
this
labour
occupied
us
several
days
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
had
a
dozen
barrels
of
excellent
salt
provision
against
the
winter
season
the
refuse
of
this
fishery
which
we
threw
into
the
sea
attracted
a
number
of
we
killed
several
for
the
sake
of
the
skin
and
the
oil
which
would
be
useful
to
burn
in
lamps
or
even
as
an
ingredient
in
soap
which
i
hoped
to
make
at
some
future
time
at
this
time
i
greatly
improved
my
sledge
by
placing
it
on
two
small
wheels
belonging
to
the
guns
of
the
ship
making
it
a
light
and
commodious
carriage
and
so
low
that
we
could
easily
place
heavy
weights
on
it
satisfied
with
our
labours
we
returned
very
happy
to
falcon
nest
to
spend
our
sunday
and
to
thank
god
heartily
for
all
the
blessings
he
had
given
us
chapter
xxxi
we
went
on
with
our
labours
but
slowly
as
many
employments
diverted
us
from
the
great
work
i
had
discovered
that
the
crystals
of
salt
in
our
grotto
had
a
bed
of
gypsum
for
their
base
from
which
i
hoped
to
obtain
a
great
advantage
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
behind
a
projecting
rock
a
natural
passage
leading
to
our
strewed
with
fragments
of
gypsum
i
took
some
of
it
to
the
kitchen
and
by
repeated
burnings
calcined
it
and
reduced
it
to
a
fine
white
powder
which
i
put
into
casks
and
carefully
preserved
for
use
my
intention
was
to
form
our
of
square
stones
cemented
with
the
gypsum
i
employed
my
sons
daily
to
collect
this
till
we
had
amassed
a
large
quantity
using
some
in
the
first
place
effectually
to
cover
our
four
barrels
were
salted
and
covered
in
this
way
the
rest
my
wife
smoked
in
a
little
hut
of
reeds
and
branches
in
the
midst
of
which
the
herrings
were
laid
on
sticks
and
exposed
to
the
smoke
of
a
fire
of
green
moss
kindled
below
this
dried
them
and
gave
them
the
peculiar
flavour
so
agreeable
to
many
we
were
visited
by
another
shoal
of
fish
a
month
after
that
of
the
herrings
jack
first
discovered
them
at
the
mouth
of
jackal
river
where
they
had
apparently
come
to
deposit
their
eggs
among
the
scattered
stones
they
were
so
large
that
he
was
sure
they
must
be
whales
i
found
them
to
be
pretty
large
sturgeons
besides
salmon
large
trout
and
many
other
fishes
jack
immediately
ran
for
his
bow
and
arrows
and
told
me
he
would
kill
them
all
he
fastened
the
end
of
a
ball
of
string
to
an
arrow
with
a
hook
at
the
end
of
it
he
tied
the
bladders
of
the
at
certain
distances
to
the
string
he
then
placed
the
ball
safe
on
the
shore
took
his
bow
fixed
the
arrow
in
it
and
aiming
at
the
largest
salmon
shot
it
in
the
side
the
fish
tried
to
escape
i
assisted
him
to
draw
the
cord
it
was
no
easy
task
for
he
struggled
tremendously
but
at
length
weakened
by
loss
of
blood
we
drew
him
to
land
and
despatched
him
the
other
boys
came
running
up
to
congratulate
the
young
fisherman
on
his
invention
and
as
it
was
to
be
feared
that
the
rest
alarmed
by
this
attack
might
take
their
departure
we
determined
to
abandon
everything
for
the
fishery
fritz
threw
his
harpoon
and
landed
by
means
of
the
reel
some
large
salmon
ernest
took
his
rod
and
caught
trout
and
i
armed
like
neptune
with
an
iron
trident
succeeded
in
striking
amongst
the
stones
some
enormous
fish
the
greatest
difficulty
was
to
land
our
booty
fritz
had
struck
a
sturgeon
at
least
eight
feet
long
which
resisted
our
united
efforts
till
my
wife
brought
the
buffalo
which
we
harnessed
to
the
line
and
made
ourselves
masters
of
this
immense
prize
we
had
a
great
deal
of
labour
in
opening
and
cleaning
all
our
fish
some
we
dried
and
salted
some
my
wife
boiled
in
oil
as
they
preserve
the
tunny
the
spawn
of
the
sturgeon
a
huge
mass
weighing
not
less
than
thirty
pounds
i
laid
aside
to
prepare
as
a
favourite
dish
in
holland
and
russia
i
carefully
cleansed
the
eggs
from
the
skin
and
fibres
that
were
mixed
with
them
washed
them
thoroughly
in
slightly
sprinkled
them
with
salt
then
put
them
in
a
gourd
pierced
with
small
holes
to
let
the
water
escape
and
placed
weights
on
them
to
press
them
completely
for
hours
we
then
removed
the
caviare
in
solid
masses
like
cheeses
took
it
to
the
to
dry
and
in
a
few
days
had
this
large
addition
to
our
winter
provision
my
next
employment
was
the
preparation
of
the
valuable
isinglass
i
took
the
and
sounds
of
the
fish
cut
them
in
strips
twisted
them
in
rolls
and
dried
them
in
the
sun
this
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
prepare
this
excellent
glue
it
becomes
very
hard
and
when
wanted
for
use
is
cut
up
in
small
pieces
and
dissolved
over
a
slow
fire
the
glue
was
so
white
and
transparent
that
i
hoped
to
make
from
it
instead
of
glass
after
this
work
was
finished
we
began
to
plan
a
boat
to
replace
our
tub
raft
i
wished
to
try
to
make
one
of
bark
as
the
savage
nations
do
and
i
proposed
to
make
an
expedition
in
search
of
a
tree
for
our
purpose
all
those
in
our
own
neighbourhood
were
too
precious
to
destroy
some
for
their
fruits
others
for
their
shade
we
resolved
to
search
at
a
distance
for
trees
fit
for
our
purpose
taking
in
our
road
a
survey
of
our
plantations
and
fields
our
garden
at
tent
house
produced
abundantly
continual
successions
of
vegetables
in
that
virgin
soil
and
in
a
climate
which
recognized
no
change
of
season
the
peas
beans
lentils
and
lettuces
were
flourishing
and
only
required
water
and
our
channels
from
the
river
brought
this
plentifully
to
us
we
had
delicious
cucumbers
and
melons
the
maize
was
already
a
foot
high
the
were
prospering
and
the
on
the
high
ground
promised
us
a
rich
treat
we
hoped
our
distant
plantations
were
going
on
as
well
and
all
set
out
one
fine
morning
to
falcon
nest
to
examine
the
state
of
things
there
we
found
my
wife
were
luxuriant
in
appearance
and
for
the
most
part
ready
for
cutting
there
were
barley
wheat
oats
beans
millet
and
lentils
we
cut
such
of
these
as
were
ready
sufficient
to
give
us
seeds
for
another
year
the
richest
crop
was
the
maize
which
suited
the
soil
but
there
were
a
quantity
of
gatherers
more
eager
to
taste
these
new
productions
than
we
were
these
were
birds
of
every
kind
from
the
bustard
to
the
quail
and
from
the
various
establishments
they
had
formed
round
it
might
be
presumed
they
would
not
leave
much
for
us
after
our
first
shock
at
the
sight
of
these
robbers
we
used
some
measures
to
lessen
the
number
of
them
fritz
unhooded
his
eagle
and
pointed
out
the
dispersing
bustards
the
bird
immediately
soared
and
pounced
on
a
superb
bustard
and
laid
it
at
the
feet
of
its
master
the
jackal
too
who
was
a
capital
pointer
brought
to
his
master
about
a
dozen
little
fat
quails
which
furnished
us
with
an
excellent
repast
to
which
my
wife
added
a
liquor
of
her
own
invention
made
of
the
green
maize
crushed
in
water
and
mingled
with
the
juice
of
the
a
most
agreeable
beverage
white
as
milk
sweet
and
refreshing
we
found
the
bustard
which
the
eagle
had
struck
down
but
slightly
wounded
we
washed
his
hurts
with
a
balsam
made
of
wine
butter
and
water
and
tied
him
by
the
leg
in
the
as
a
companion
to
our
tame
bustard
we
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
at
falcon
nest
putting
our
summer
abode
into
order
and
thrashing
out
our
grain
to
save
the
precious
seed
for
another
year
the
turkey
wheat
was
laid
by
in
sheaves
till
we
should
have
time
to
thrash
and
winnow
it
and
then
i
told
fritz
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
put
the
in
order
that
we
had
brought
from
the
wreck
fritz
thought
we
could
build
a
mill
ourselves
on
the
river
but
this
bold
scheme
was
at
present
impracticable
the
next
day
we
set
out
on
an
excursion
in
the
neighbourhood
my
wife
wished
to
establish
colonies
of
our
animals
at
some
distance
from
falcon
nest
at
a
convenient
spot
where
they
would
be
secure
and
might
find
subsistence
she
selected
from
her
twelve
young
fowls
i
took
four
young
pigs
two
couple
of
sheep
and
two
goats
these
animals
were
placed
in
the
cart
in
which
we
had
previously
placed
our
provisions
of
every
kind
and
the
tools
and
utensils
we
might
need
not
forgetting
the
rope
ladder
and
the
portable
tent
we
then
harnessed
the
buffalo
the
cow
and
the
ass
and
departed
on
our
tour
fritz
rode
before
on
lightfoot
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
that
we
might
not
plunge
into
any
difficulties
as
this
time
we
went
in
a
new
direction
exactly
in
the
midst
between
the
rocks
and
the
shore
that
we
might
get
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
country
that
stretched
to
cape
disappointment
we
had
the
usual
difficulty
at
first
in
getting
through
the
high
grass
and
the
underwood
embarrassed
our
road
till
we
were
compelled
to
use
the
axe
frequently
i
made
some
trifling
discoveries
that
were
useful
while
engaged
in
this
labour
amongst
others
some
roots
of
trees
curved
like
saddles
and
yokes
for
beasts
of
draught
i
cut
away
several
of
these
and
placed
them
on
the
cart
when
we
had
nearly
passed
the
wood
we
were
struck
with
the
singular
appearance
of
a
little
thicket
of
low
bushes
apparently
covered
with
snow
francis
clapped
his
hands
with
joy
and
begged
to
get
out
of
the
cart
that
he
might
make
some
snowballs
fritz
galloped
forward
and
returned
bringing
me
a
branch
loaded
with
this
beautiful
white
down
which
to
my
great
joy
i
recognized
to
be
cotton
it
was
a
discovery
of
inestimable
value
to
us
and
my
wife
began
immediately
to
enumerate
all
the
advantages
we
should
derive
from
it
when
i
should
have
constructed
for
her
the
machines
for
spinning
and
weaving
the
cotton
we
soon
gathered
as
much
as
filled
three
bags
intending
afterwards
to
collect
the
seeds
of
this
marvellous
plant
to
sow
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tent
house
after
crossing
the
plain
of
the
we
reached
the
summit
of
a
hill
from
which
the
eye
rested
on
a
terrestrial
paradise
trees
of
every
sort
covered
the
sides
of
the
hill
and
a
murmuring
stream
crossed
the
plain
adding
to
its
beauty
and
fertility
the
wood
we
had
just
crossed
formed
a
shelter
against
the
north
winds
and
the
rich
pasture
offered
food
for
our
cattle
we
decided
at
once
that
this
should
be
the
site
of
our
farm
we
erected
our
tent
made
a
fireplace
and
set
about
cooking
our
dinner
while
this
was
going
on
fritz
and
i
sought
a
convenient
spot
for
our
structure
and
we
met
with
a
group
of
beautiful
trees
at
such
a
distance
one
from
another
as
to
form
natural
pillars
for
our
dwelling
we
carried
all
our
tools
here
but
as
the
day
was
far
advanced
we
delayed
commencing
our
work
till
next
day
we
returned
to
the
tent
and
found
my
wife
and
her
boys
picking
cotton
with
which
they
made
some
very
comfortable
beds
and
we
slept
peacefully
under
our
canvass
roof
chapter
xxxii
the
trees
which
i
had
chosen
for
my
farmhouse
were
about
a
foot
in
diameter
in
the
trunk
they
formed
a
long
square
the
long
side
facing
the
sea
the
dimensions
of
the
whole
were
about
feet
by
sixteen
i
cut
deep
mortices
in
the
trees
about
ten
feet
distant
from
the
ground
and
again
ten
feet
higher
to
form
a
second
story
i
then
placed
in
them
strong
poles
this
was
the
skeleton
of
my
house
solid
if
not
elegant
i
placed
over
this
a
rude
roof
of
bark
cut
in
squares
and
placed
sloping
that
the
rain
might
run
off
we
fastened
these
with
the
thorn
of
the
acacia
as
our
nails
were
too
precious
to
be
lavished
while
procuring
the
bark
we
made
many
discoveries
the
first
was
that
of
two
remarkable
trees
the
and
the
atlantica
the
next
the
thorny
acacia
from
which
we
got
the
substitute
for
nails
the
instinct
of
my
goats
led
us
also
to
find
out
among
the
pieces
of
bark
that
of
the
cinnamon
not
perhaps
equal
to
that
of
ceylon
but
very
fragrant
and
agreeable
but
this
was
of
little
value
compared
to
the
turpentine
and
mastic
i
hoped
to
procure
from
the
pistachios
to
compose
a
sort
of
pitch
to
complete
our
intended
boat
we
continued
our
work
at
the
house
which
occupied
us
several
days
we
formed
the
walls
of
thin
laths
interwoven
with
long
pliant
reeds
for
about
six
feet
from
the
ground
the
rest
was
merely
a
sort
of
light
to
admit
light
and
air
the
door
opened
on
the
front
to
the
sea
the
interior
consisted
simply
of
a
series
of
compartments
proportioned
to
the
guests
they
were
to
contain
one
small
apartment
was
for
ourselves
when
we
chose
to
visit
our
colony
on
the
upper
story
was
a
sort
of
hayloft
for
the
fodder
we
projected
plastering
the
walls
with
clay
but
these
finishing
touches
we
deferred
to
a
future
time
contented
that
we
had
provided
a
shelter
for
our
cattle
and
fowls
to
accustom
them
to
come
to
this
shelter
of
themselves
we
took
care
to
fill
their
racks
with
the
food
they
liked
best
mingled
with
salt
and
this
we
proposed
to
renew
at
intervals
till
the
habit
of
coming
to
their
houses
was
fixed
we
all
laboured
ardently
but
the
work
proceeded
slowly
from
our
inexperience
and
the
provisions
we
had
brought
were
nearly
exhausted
i
did
not
wish
to
return
to
falcon
nest
till
i
had
completed
my
new
establishment
and
therefore
determined
to
send
fritz
and
jack
to
look
after
the
animals
at
home
and
bring
back
a
fresh
stock
of
provisions
our
two
young
couriers
set
out
each
on
his
favourite
steed
fritz
leading
the
ass
to
bring
back
the
load
and
jack
urging
the
indolent
animal
forward
with
his
whip
during
their
absence
ernest
and
i
made
a
little
excursion
to
add
to
our
provision
if
we
could
meet
with
them
some
potatoes
and
we
ascended
the
stream
for
some
time
which
led
us
to
a
large
marsh
beyond
which
we
discovered
a
lake
abounding
with
this
lake
was
surrounded
by
tall
thick
grass
with
ears
of
a
grain
which
i
found
to
be
a
very
good
though
small
sort
of
rice
as
to
the
lake
itself
it
is
only
a
swiss
accustomed
from
his
infancy
to
look
on
such
smooth
tranquil
waters
that
can
comprehend
the
happiness
we
felt
on
looking
upon
this
we
fancied
we
were
once
more
in
switzerland
our
own
dear
land
but
the
majestic
trees
and
luxuriant
vegetation
soon
reminded
us
we
were
no
longer
in
europe
and
that
the
ocean
separated
us
from
our
native
home
in
the
mean
time
ernest
had
brought
down
several
birds
with
a
skill
and
success
that
surprised
me
a
little
after
we
saw
knips
leap
off
the
back
of
his
usual
palfrey
flora
and
making
his
way
through
the
rich
grass
collect
and
carry
rapidly
to
his
mouth
something
that
seemed
particularly
to
please
his
palate
we
followed
him
and
to
our
great
comfort
were
able
to
refresh
ourselves
with
that
delicious
strawberry
called
in
europe
the
chili
or
pineapple
strawberry
we
ate
plentifully
of
this
fruit
which
was
of
enormous
size
ernest
especially
enjoyed
them
but
did
not
forget
the
absent
he
filled
knips
little
pannier
with
them
and
i
covered
them
with
large
leaves
which
i
fastened
down
with
reeds
lest
he
should
take
a
fancy
to
help
himself
as
we
went
home
i
took
also
a
specimen
of
rice
for
the
inspection
of
our
good
housekeeper
who
would
i
knew
rejoice
in
such
an
acquisition
we
proceeded
round
the
lake
which
presented
a
different
scene
on
every
side
this
was
one
of
the
most
lovely
and
fertile
parts
we
had
yet
seen
of
this
country
birds
of
all
kinds
abounded
but
we
were
particularly
struck
with
a
pair
of
black
swans
sailing
majestically
on
the
water
their
plumage
was
perfectly
black
and
glossy
except
the
extremity
of
the
wings
which
was
white
ernest
would
have
tried
his
skill
again
but
i
forbade
him
to
disturb
the
profound
tranquillity
of
this
charming
region
but
flora
who
probably
had
not
the
same
taste
for
the
beauties
of
nature
that
i
had
suddenly
darted
forward
like
an
arrow
pounced
upon
a
creature
that
was
swimming
quietly
at
the
edge
of
the
water
and
brought
it
to
us
it
was
a
most
curious
animal
it
resembled
an
otter
in
form
but
was
had
an
erect
bushy
tail
like
the
squirrel
small
head
eyes
and
ears
almost
invisible
a
long
flat
bill
like
that
of
a
duck
completed
its
strange
appearance
we
were
completely
puzzled
even
ernest
the
naturalist
could
not
give
its
name
i
boldly
gave
it
the
name
of
the
beast
with
a
bill
i
told
ernest
to
take
it
as
i
wished
to
stuff
and
preserve
it
it
will
be
said
the
little
philosopher
the
first
natural
object
for
our
museum
exactly
replied
i
and
when
the
establishment
is
fully
arranged
we
will
appoint
you
curator
but
thinking
my
wife
would
grow
uneasy
at
our
protracted
absence
we
returned
by
a
direct
road
to
the
tent
our
two
messengers
arrived
about
the
same
time
and
we
all
sat
down
together
to
a
cheerful
repast
every
one
related
his
feats
ernest
dwelt
on
his
discoveries
and
was
very
pompous
in
his
descriptions
and
i
was
obliged
to
promise
to
take
fritz
another
time
i
learnt
with
pleasure
that
all
was
going
on
well
at
falcon
nest
and
that
the
boys
had
had
the
forethought
to
leave
the
animals
with
provisions
for
ten
days
this
enabled
me
to
complete
my
farmhouse
we
remained
four
days
longer
in
which
time
i
finished
the
interior
and
my
wife
arranged
in
our
own
apartment
the
cotton
mattresses
to
be
ready
for
our
visits
and
put
into
the
houses
the
fodder
and
grain
for
their
respective
tenants
we
then
loaded
our
cart
and
began
our
march
the
animals
wished
to
follow
us
but
fritz
on
lightfoot
covered
our
retreat
and
kept
them
at
the
farm
till
we
were
out
of
sight
we
did
not
proceed
directly
but
went
towards
the
wood
of
monkeys
these
mischievous
creatures
assaulted
us
with
showers
of
the
but
a
few
shots
dispersed
our
assailants
fritz
collected
some
of
these
new
fruits
they
had
flung
at
us
and
i
recognized
them
as
those
of
the
stone
pine
the
kernel
of
which
is
good
to
eat
and
produces
an
excellent
oil
we
gathered
a
bag
of
these
and
continued
our
journey
till
we
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
cape
disappointment
there
we
ascended
a
little
hill
from
the
summit
of
which
we
looked
upon
rich
plains
rivers
and
woods
clothed
with
verdure
and
brilliant
flowers
and
gay
birds
that
fluttered
among
the
bushes
here
my
children
cried
i
here
we
will
build
our
summer
house
this
is
truly
arcadia
here
we
placed
our
tent
and
immediately
began
to
erect
a
new
building
formed
in
the
same
manner
as
the
farm
house
but
now
executed
more
quickly
we
raised
the
roof
in
the
middle
and
made
four
sloped
sides
the
interior
was
divided
into
eating
and
sleeping
apartments
stables
and
a
for
provisions
the
whole
was
completed
and
provisioned
in
ten
days
and
we
had
now
another
mansion
for
ourselves
and
a
shelter
for
new
colonies
of
animals
this
new
erection
received
the
name
of
prospect
hill
to
gratify
ernest
who
thought
it
had
an
english
appearance
however
the
end
for
which
our
expedition
was
planned
was
not
yet
fulfilled
i
had
not
yet
met
with
a
tree
likely
to
suit
me
for
a
boat
we
returned
then
to
inspect
the
trees
and
i
fixed
on
a
sort
of
oak
the
bark
of
which
was
closer
than
that
of
the
european
oak
resembling
more
that
of
the
the
trunk
was
at
least
five
feet
in
diameter
and
i
fancied
its
coating
if
i
could
obtain
it
whole
would
perfectly
answer
my
purpose
i
traced
a
circle
at
the
foot
and
with
a
small
saw
cut
the
bark
entirely
through
fritz
by
means
of
the
rope
ladder
we
had
brought
with
us
and
attached
to
the
lower
branches
of
the
tree
ascended
and
cut
a
similar
circle
eighteen
feet
above
mine
we
then
cut
out
perpendicularly
a
slip
the
whole
length
and
removing
it
we
had
room
to
insert
the
necessary
tools
and
with
wedges
we
finally
succeeded
in
loosening
the
whole
the
first
part
was
easy
enough
but
there
was
greater
difficulty
as
we
advanced
we
sustained
it
as
we
proceeded
with
ropes
and
then
gently
let
it
down
on
the
grass
i
immediately
began
to
form
my
boat
while
the
bark
was
fresh
and
flexible
my
sons
in
their
impatience
thought
it
would
do
very
well
if
we
nailed
a
board
at
each
end
of
the
roll
but
this
would
have
been
merely
a
heavy
trough
inelegant
and
unserviceable
i
wished
to
have
one
that
would
look
well
by
the
side
of
the
pinnace
and
this
idea
at
once
rendered
my
boys
patient
and
obedient
we
began
by
cutting
out
at
each
end
of
the
roll
of
bark
a
triangular
piece
of
about
five
feet
long
then
placing
the
sloping
parts
one
over
the
other
i
united
them
with
pegs
and
strong
glue
and
thus
finished
the
ends
of
my
boat
in
a
pointed
form
this
operation
having
widened
it
too
much
in
the
middle
we
passed
strong
ropes
round
it
and
drew
it
into
the
form
we
required
we
then
exposed
it
to
the
sun
which
dried
and
fixed
it
in
the
proper
shape
as
many
things
were
necessary
to
complete
my
work
i
sent
fritz
and
jack
to
tent
house
for
the
sledge
to
convey
it
there
that
we
might
finish
it
more
conveniently
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
some
very
hard
crooked
wood
the
natural
curve
of
which
would
be
admirably
suitable
for
supporting
the
sides
of
the
boat
we
found
also
a
resinous
tree
which
distilled
a
sort
of
pitch
easy
to
manage
and
which
soon
hardened
in
the
sun
my
wife
and
francis
collected
sufficient
of
it
for
my
work
it
was
almost
night
when
our
two
messengers
returned
we
had
only
time
to
sup
and
retire
to
our
rest
we
were
all
early
at
work
next
morning
we
loaded
the
sledge
placing
on
it
the
canoe
the
wood
for
the
sides
the
pitch
and
some
young
trees
which
i
had
transplanted
for
our
plantation
at
tent
house
and
which
we
put
into
the
boat
but
before
we
set
out
i
wished
to
erect
a
sort
of
fortification
at
the
pass
of
the
rock
for
the
double
purpose
of
securing
us
against
the
attacks
of
wild
beasts
or
of
savages
and
for
keeping
enclosed
in
the
savannah
beyond
the
rocks
some
young
pigs
that
we
wished
to
multiply
there
out
of
the
way
of
our
fields
and
plantations
as
we
crossed
the
plantation
i
saw
some
bamboos
larger
than
any
i
had
ever
met
with
and
we
cut
down
one
for
a
mast
to
our
canoe
we
now
had
the
river
to
our
left
and
the
chain
of
rocks
to
our
right
which
here
approached
the
river
leaving
only
a
narrow
pass
at
the
narrowest
part
of
this
we
raised
a
rampart
before
a
deep
ditch
which
could
only
be
crossed
by
a
drawbridge
we
placed
there
beyond
the
bridge
we
put
a
narrow
gate
of
woven
bamboos
to
enable
us
to
enter
the
country
beyond
when
we
wished
we
planted
the
side
of
the
rampart
with
dwarf
palms
india
fig
and
other
thorny
shrubs
making
a
winding
path
through
the
plantation
and
digging
in
the
midst
a
hidden
pitfall
known
to
ourselves
by
four
low
posts
intended
to
support
a
plank
bridge
when
we
wished
to
cross
it
after
this
was
completed
we
built
a
little
of
bark
in
that
part
of
the
plantation
that
faced
the
stream
and
gave
it
the
name
of
the
hermitage
intending
it
for
a
after
several
days
of
hard
labour
we
returned
to
prospect
hill
and
took
a
little
relaxation
the
only
work
we
did
was
to
prepare
the
mast
and
lay
it
on
the
sledge
with
the
rest
the
next
morning
we
returned
to
tent
house
where
we
immediately
set
to
work
on
our
canoe
with
such
diligence
that
it
was
soon
completed
it
was
solid
and
elegant
lined
through
with
wood
and
furnished
with
a
keel
we
provided
it
with
brass
rings
for
the
oars
and
stays
for
the
mast
instead
of
ballast
i
laid
at
the
bottom
a
layer
of
stones
covered
with
clay
and
over
this
a
flooring
of
boards
the
benches
for
the
rowers
were
laid
across
and
in
the
midst
the
bamboo
mast
rose
majestically
with
a
triangular
sail
behind
i
fixed
the
rudder
worked
by
a
tiller
and
i
could
boast
now
of
having
built
a
capital
canoe
our
fleet
was
now
in
good
condition
for
distant
excursions
we
could
take
the
pinnace
but
the
canoe
would
be
invaluable
for
the
coasting
service
our
cow
had
in
the
mean
time
given
us
a
young
male
calf
which
i
undertook
to
train
for
service
as
i
had
done
the
buffalo
beginning
by
piercing
its
nostrils
and
the
calf
promised
to
be
docile
and
useful
and
as
each
of
the
other
boys
had
his
favourite
animal
to
ride
i
bestowed
the
bull
on
francis
and
intrusted
him
with
its
education
to
encourage
him
to
habits
of
boldness
and
activity
he
was
delighted
with
his
new
charger
and
chose
to
give
him
the
name
of
valiant
we
had
still
two
months
before
the
rainy
season
and
this
time
we
devoted
to
completing
the
comforts
of
our
grotto
we
made
all
the
partitions
of
wood
except
those
which
divided
us
from
the
stables
which
we
built
of
stone
to
exclude
any
smell
from
the
animals
we
soon
acquired
skill
in
our
works
we
had
a
plentiful
supply
of
beams
and
planks
from
the
ship
and
by
practice
we
became
very
good
plasterers
we
covered
the
floors
with
a
sort
of
mud
smoothed
it
and
it
dried
perfectly
hard
we
then
contrived
a
sort
of
felt
carpet
we
first
covered
the
floor
with
sailcloth
we
spread
over
this
wool
and
hair
mixed
and
poured
over
it
isinglass
dissolved
rolling
up
the
carpet
and
beating
it
well
when
this
was
dry
we
repeated
the
process
and
in
the
end
had
a
felt
carpet
we
made
one
of
these
for
each
room
to
guard
against
any
damp
that
we
might
be
subject
to
in
the
rainy
season
the
privations
we
had
suffered
the
preceding
winter
increased
the
enjoyment
of
our
present
comforts
the
rainy
season
came
on
we
had
now
a
warm
convenient
habitation
and
abundance
of
excellent
provision
for
ourselves
and
our
cattle
in
the
morning
we
could
attend
to
their
wants
without
trouble
for
the
carefully
collected
in
clean
vessels
prevented
the
necessity
of
going
to
the
river
we
then
assembled
in
the
to
prayers
after
that
we
went
to
our
my
wife
took
her
wheel
or
her
loom
which
was
a
rude
construction
of
mine
but
in
which
she
had
contrived
to
weave
some
useful
cloth
of
wool
and
cotton
and
also
some
linen
which
she
had
made
up
for
us
everybody
worked
the
workshop
was
never
empty
i
contrived
with
the
wheel
of
a
gun
to
arrange
a
sort
of
lathe
by
means
of
which
i
and
my
sons
produced
some
neat
furniture
and
utensils
ernest
surpassed
us
all
in
this
art
and
made
some
elegant
little
things
for
his
mother
after
dinner
our
evening
occupations
commenced
our
room
was
lighted
up
brilliantly
we
did
not
spare
our
candles
which
were
so
easily
procured
and
we
enjoyed
the
reflection
in
the
elegant
crystals
above
us
we
had
partitioned
off
a
little
chapel
in
one
corner
of
the
grotto
which
we
had
left
untouched
and
nothing
could
be
more
magnificent
than
this
chapel
lighted
up
with
its
colonnades
portico
and
altars
we
had
divine
service
here
every
sunday
i
had
erected
a
sort
of
pulpit
from
which
i
delivered
a
short
sermon
to
my
congregation
which
i
endeavoured
to
render
as
simple
and
as
instructive
as
possible
jack
and
francis
had
a
natural
taste
for
music
i
made
them
flageolets
of
reeds
on
which
they
acquired
considerable
skill
they
accompanied
their
mother
who
had
a
very
good
voice
and
this
music
in
our
lofty
grotto
had
a
charming
effect
we
had
thus
made
great
steps
towards
civilization
and
though
condemned
perhaps
to
pass
our
lives
alone
on
this
unknown
shore
we
might
yet
be
happy
we
were
placed
in
the
midst
of
abundance
we
were
active
industrious
and
content
blessed
with
health
and
united
by
affection
our
minds
seemed
to
enlarge
and
improve
every
day
we
saw
around
us
on
every
side
traces
of
the
divine
wisdom
and
beneficence
and
our
hearts
overflowed
with
love
and
veneration
for
that
almighty
hand
which
had
so
miraculously
saved
and
continued
to
protect
us
i
humbly
trusted
in
him
either
to
restore
us
to
the
world
or
send
some
beings
to
join
us
in
this
beloved
island
where
for
two
years
we
had
seen
no
trace
of
man
to
him
we
committed
our
fate
we
were
happy
and
tranquil
looking
with
resignation
to
the
future
end
of
the
first
part
of
the
journal
postscript
by
the
editor
it
is
necessary
to
explain
how
this
first
part
of
the
journal
of
the
swiss
pastor
came
into
my
hands
three
or
four
years
after
the
family
had
been
cast
on
this
desert
coast
where
as
we
see
they
lived
a
happy
and
contented
life
an
english
transport
was
driven
by
a
storm
upon
the
same
shore
this
vessel
was
the
captain
johnson
and
was
returning
from
new
zealand
to
the
eastern
coast
of
north
america
by
otaheite
to
fetch
a
cargo
of
furs
for
china
and
then
to
proceed
from
canton
to
england
a
violent
storm
which
lasted
several
days
drove
them
out
of
their
course
for
many
days
they
wandered
in
unknown
seas
and
the
ship
was
so
injured
by
the
storm
that
the
captain
looked
out
for
some
port
to
repair
it
they
discovered
a
rocky
coast
and
as
the
violence
of
the
wind
was
lulled
ventured
to
approach
the
shore
at
a
short
distance
they
anchored
and
sent
a
boat
to
examine
the
coast
lieutenant
bell
who
went
with
the
boat
knew
a
little
german
they
were
some
time
before
they
could
venture
to
land
among
the
rocks
which
guarded
the
island
but
turning
the
promontory
they
saw
safety
bay
and
entering
it
were
astonished
to
see
a
handsome
pinnace
and
boat
at
anchor
near
the
strand
a
tent
and
in
the
rock
doors
and
windows
like
those
of
a
european
house
they
landed
and
saw
a
man
coming
to
meet
them
clothed
in
european
fashion
and
well
armed
after
a
friendly
salutation
they
first
spoke
in
german
and
then
in
english
this
was
the
good
father
the
family
were
at
falcon
nest
where
they
were
spending
the
summer
he
had
seen
the
vessel
in
the
morning
through
his
telescope
but
unwilling
to
alarm
or
to
encourage
hopes
that
might
be
vain
he
had
not
spoken
of
it
but
come
alone
towards
the
coast
after
much
friendly
conference
the
party
were
regaled
with
all
hospitality
at
tent
house
the
good
swiss
gave
the
lieutenant
this
first
part
of
his
journal
for
the
perusal
of
captain
johnson
and
after
an
hour
conversation
they
separated
hoping
to
have
a
pleasant
meeting
next
day
but
heaven
decreed
it
otherwise
during
the
night
another
fearful
storm
arose
the
lost
its
anchor
and
was
driven
out
to
sea
and
after
several
days
of
anxiety
and
danger
found
itself
so
far
from
the
island
and
so
much
shattered
that
all
thoughts
of
returning
were
given
up
for
that
time
and
captain
johnson
reluctantly
relinquished
the
hope
of
rescuing
the
interesting
family
thus
it
happened
that
the
first
part
of
this
journal
was
brought
to
england
and
from
thence
sent
to
me
a
friend
of
the
family
in
switzerland
accompanied
by
a
letter
from
the
captain
declaring
that
he
could
have
no
rest
till
he
found
and
became
acquainted
with
this
happy
family
that
he
would
search
for
the
island
in
his
future
voyages
and
either
bring
away
the
family
or
if
they
preferred
to
remain
he
would
send
out
from
england
some
colonists
and
everything
that
might
be
necessary
to
promote
their
comfort
a
rough
map
of
the
island
is
added
to
the
journal
executed
by
fritz
the
eldest
son
continuation
of
the
journal
chapter
xxxiii
i
left
the
reader
at
the
moment
in
which
i
had
placed
the
first
part
of
my
journal
in
the
hands
of
lieutenant
bell
to
deliver
to
captain
johnson
of
the
english
vessel
the
expecting
him
to
return
the
next
day
with
lieutenant
bell
we
separated
in
this
hope
and
i
thought
it
necessary
to
inform
my
family
of
this
expected
visit
which
might
decide
their
future
lot
my
wife
and
elder
sons
might
wish
to
seize
this
only
occasion
that
might
occur
to
revisit
their
native
country
to
quit
their
beloved
island
which
would
doubtless
cost
them
much
sorrow
at
the
last
moment
but
was
necessary
to
their
future
comfort
i
could
not
help
feeling
distressed
at
the
prospect
of
my
dear
children
solitary
old
age
and
i
determined
if
they
did
not
wish
to
return
with
captain
johnson
to
request
him
to
send
some
colonists
out
to
people
our
island
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
had
left
home
alone
and
at
an
early
hour
having
perceived
a
vessel
from
the
top
of
our
tree
with
my
telescope
i
had
set
out
without
breakfast
without
giving
my
sons
their
tasks
or
making
any
arrangements
for
the
labours
of
the
day
my
conference
with
lieutenant
bell
had
been
long
it
was
now
past
noon
and
knowing
how
prompt
my
wife
was
to
alarm
herself
i
was
surprised
that
i
did
not
meet
her
nor
any
of
my
sons
i
began
to
be
uneasy
and
on
my
arrival
i
hastily
mounted
the
tree
and
found
my
faithful
partner
extended
on
her
bed
surrounded
by
her
four
sons
and
apparently
in
great
pain
i
demanded
with
a
cry
of
grief
what
had
happened
all
wished
to
speak
at
once
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
i
learned
that
my
dear
wife
in
descending
the
staircase
had
been
seized
with
a
giddiness
in
her
head
and
had
fallen
down
and
injured
herself
so
much
that
she
was
unable
to
rise
without
assistance
she
was
now
enduring
great
pain
in
her
right
leg
and
in
her
left
foot
ernest
and
i
added
fritz
carried
her
without
delay
to
her
bed
though
not
without
difficulty
for
the
staircase
is
so
narrow
but
she
continued
to
get
worse
and
we
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
have
rubbed
her
foot
continually
but
it
swells
more
and
more
as
well
as
her
leg
which
i
dare
not
touch
it
hurts
her
so
much
i
remember
father
that
of
the
chests
that
we
brought
from
the
ship
there
is
one
unopened
which
is
marked
may
it
not
contain
something
that
will
relieve
mamma
perhaps
it
may
my
son
you
did
well
to
remember
it
we
will
go
to
tent
house
for
it
fritz
you
shall
accompany
me
to
assist
in
bringing
it
i
wished
to
be
alone
with
fritz
to
consult
him
about
the
english
vessel
and
was
glad
of
this
opportunity
before
i
left
my
wife
i
intended
to
examine
her
leg
and
foot
which
were
exceedingly
painful
when
i
was
preparing
to
enter
the
church
i
had
studied
medicine
and
practical
surgery
in
order
to
be
able
to
administer
to
the
bodily
afflictions
of
my
poor
parishioners
as
well
as
to
their
spiritual
sorrows
i
knew
how
to
bleed
and
could
replace
a
dislocated
limb
i
had
often
made
cures
but
since
my
arrival
at
the
island
i
had
neglected
my
medical
studies
which
happily
had
not
been
needed
i
hoped
now
however
to
recall
as
much
of
my
knowledge
as
would
be
sufficient
to
cure
my
poor
wife
i
examined
her
foot
first
which
i
found
to
be
violently
sprained
she
begged
me
then
to
look
at
her
leg
and
what
was
my
distress
when
i
saw
it
was
fractured
above
the
ancle
however
the
fracture
appeared
simple
without
splinters
and
easy
to
cure
i
sent
fritz
without
delay
to
procure
me
two
pieces
of
the
bark
of
a
tree
between
which
i
placed
the
leg
after
having
with
the
assistance
of
my
son
stretched
it
till
the
two
pieces
of
broken
bone
united
i
then
bound
it
with
bandages
of
linen
and
tied
the
pieces
of
bark
round
the
leg
so
that
it
might
not
be
moved
i
bound
the
sprained
foot
very
tightly
till
i
could
procure
the
balsam
which
i
expected
to
find
in
the
chest
i
felt
assured
that
the
giddiness
of
the
head
which
had
caused
her
fall
proceeded
from
some
existing
cause
which
i
suspected
from
the
pulse
and
the
complexion
must
be
a
fulness
of
blood
and
it
appeared
to
be
necessary
to
take
away
some
ounces
which
i
persuaded
her
to
allow
me
to
do
when
i
should
have
brought
my
and
instruments
from
tent
house
i
left
her
with
many
charges
to
the
care
of
my
three
younger
sons
and
proceeded
to
tent
house
with
fritz
to
whom
i
now
related
my
morning
adventure
and
consulted
him
how
we
should
mention
it
to
his
mother
fritz
was
astonished
i
saw
how
his
mind
was
employed
he
looked
round
on
our
fields
and
plantations
increasing
and
prospering
we
must
not
tell
her
father
said
he
i
will
be
at
tent
house
early
in
the
morning
you
must
give
me
some
commission
to
execute
i
will
await
the
arrival
of
the
captain
and
tell
him
that
my
dear
mother
is
ill
and
that
he
may
return
as
he
came
you
speak
rashly
fritz
answered
i
i
have
told
you
that
this
ship
has
suffered
much
from
the
storm
and
needs
repairs
have
you
not
often
read
the
golden
rule
of
our
divine
master
unto
others
as
you
would
have
others
do
unto
you
our
duty
is
to
receive
the
captain
into
our
island
and
to
assist
him
in
repairing
and
refitting
his
vessel
and
he
will
find
said
he
we
know
something
of
that
kind
of
work
did
you
show
him
our
beautiful
pinnace
and
canoe
but
can
such
a
large
vessel
enter
our
bay
of
safety
no
replied
i
i
fear
there
will
not
be
sufficient
water
but
we
will
show
the
captain
the
large
bay
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
formed
by
cape
disappointment
he
will
find
there
a
beautiful
harbour
and
he
and
his
officers
may
live
at
the
farm
and
we
can
go
over
every
day
to
assist
in
repairing
their
vessel
continued
fritz
very
well
said
i
and
when
it
is
finished
he
will
in
return
give
us
a
place
in
it
to
return
to
europe
to
return
to
europe
father
cried
he
to
leave
our
beautiful
winter
dwelling
tent
house
and
our
charming
summer
residence
falcon
nest
our
dear
good
animals
our
crystals
of
salt
our
farms
so
much
that
is
our
own
and
which
nobody
covets
to
return
into
europe
to
poverty
to
war
to
those
wicked
soldiers
who
have
banished
us
we
want
nothing
dear
father
can
you
consent
to
leave
our
beloved
island
you
are
right
my
dear
son
said
i
would
to
god
we
might
always
remain
here
happily
together
but
we
are
of
different
ages
and
by
the
law
of
nature
we
must
one
day
be
separated
consider
my
dear
son
if
you
should
survive
your
brothers
how
cheerless
it
would
be
to
live
quite
alone
on
this
desert
island
without
any
one
to
close
your
eyes
but
let
us
look
at
these
trees
i
see
they
are
their
fruit
contains
a
pulp
which
is
very
useful
in
medicine
and
which
will
suit
your
mother
i
think
as
well
as
the
juice
of
the
orange
or
lemon
we
shall
find
some
of
the
latter
at
our
plantation
near
tent
house
but
in
the
mean
time
do
you
climb
the
and
gather
some
of
those
pods
which
resemble
those
of
beans
fill
one
side
of
the
bag
with
them
the
other
we
will
reserve
for
the
oranges
and
lemons
not
to
lose
any
time
i
will
go
on
to
tent
house
to
seek
for
the
two
chests
and
you
can
follow
me
fritz
was
up
the
in
a
moment
i
crossed
family
bridge
and
soon
reached
the
grotto
i
lighted
a
candle
which
i
always
kept
ready
entered
the
magazine
and
found
the
two
chests
labelled
they
were
neither
large
nor
heavy
and
having
tied
cords
round
them
for
the
convenience
of
carrying
them
i
proceeded
to
visit
the
orange
and
lemon
trees
where
i
found
the
fruit
sufficiently
ripe
for
lemonade
fritz
came
to
meet
me
with
a
good
supply
of
tamarinds
we
filled
the
other
end
of
his
sack
with
oranges
and
lemons
he
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
and
neither
of
us
being
overloaded
we
pursued
our
way
homewards
very
quickly
notwithstanding
the
heat
which
was
excessively
oppressive
though
the
sun
was
hidden
under
the
thick
clouds
which
entirely
concealed
the
sea
from
us
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
waves
breaking
against
the
rocks
fritz
expressed
his
fears
that
a
storm
was
coming
on
which
might
prove
fatal
to
the
vessel
and
wished
to
take
out
the
pinnace
and
endeavour
to
assist
captain
johnson
delighted
as
i
felt
with
his
fearless
humanity
i
could
not
consent
i
reminded
him
of
the
situation
of
his
mother
forgive
me
dear
father
said
he
i
had
forgotten
everything
but
the
poor
vessel
but
the
captain
may
do
as
we
did
leave
his
ship
between
the
rocks
and
come
with
all
in
the
vessel
to
establish
themselves
here
we
will
give
them
up
a
corner
of
our
islands
and
if
there
should
be
any
ladies
amongst
them
how
pleasant
it
would
be
for
mamma
to
have
a
friend
the
rain
now
fell
in
torrents
and
we
proceeded
with
great
difficulty
after
crossing
the
bridge
we
saw
at
a
distance
a
very
extraordinary
figure
approaching
us
we
could
not
ascertain
what
species
of
animal
it
was
it
appeared
taller
than
any
of
the
monkeys
we
had
seen
and
much
larger
of
a
black
or
brown
colour
we
could
not
distinguish
the
head
but
it
seemed
to
have
two
thick
and
moveable
horns
before
it
we
had
fortunately
taken
no
gun
with
us
or
fritz
would
certainly
have
fired
at
this
singular
animal
but
as
it
rapidly
approached
us
we
soon
recognized
the
step
and
the
cry
of
pleasure
which
hailed
us
it
is
jack
we
exclaimed
and
in
fact
it
was
he
who
was
hurrying
to
meet
us
with
my
large
cloak
and
waterproof
caoutchouc
boots
i
had
neglected
to
take
them
and
my
dear
little
fellow
had
volunteered
to
bring
them
to
tent
house
to
protect
himself
on
the
way
he
had
put
the
cloak
on
covering
his
head
with
the
hood
and
my
boots
being
too
large
for
him
he
had
put
one
on
each
arm
which
he
held
up
to
secure
the
hood
conceive
what
a
singular
figure
he
made
notwithstanding
our
uneasiness
and
our
wretched
condition
for
we
were
wet
to
the
skin
we
could
not
but
laugh
heartily
at
him
i
would
not
consent
to
use
the
coverings
he
had
brought
neither
fritz
nor
i
could
be
worse
for
the
distance
we
had
to
go
and
jack
was
younger
and
more
delicate
i
obliged
him
therefore
to
retain
his
curious
protection
and
asked
how
he
had
left
his
mother
very
uneasy
said
he
about
you
else
i
think
she
must
be
much
better
for
her
cheeks
are
very
red
and
her
eyes
very
bright
and
she
talks
incessantly
she
would
have
come
herself
to
seek
you
but
could
not
rise
and
when
i
told
her
i
would
come
she
bid
me
be
very
quick
but
when
i
was
coming
down
stairs
i
heard
her
call
me
back
for
fear
of
the
rain
and
the
thunder
i
would
not
hear
her
but
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
hoping
to
reach
tent
house
why
did
you
come
back
so
soon
to
spare
you
half
your
journey
my
brave
little
man
said
i
hastening
on
for
jack
account
of
his
mother
made
me
uneasy
i
perceived
she
must
be
labouring
under
fever
and
the
blood
ascending
to
her
head
my
children
followed
me
and
we
soon
reached
the
foot
of
our
castle
in
the
air
chapter
xxxiv
we
entered
our
apartment
literally
as
if
we
had
come
out
of
the
sea
and
i
found
my
poor
elizabeth
much
agitated
heaven
be
praised
said
she
but
where
is
jack
that
rash
little
fellow
here
i
am
mamma
said
he
as
dry
as
when
i
left
you
i
have
left
my
dress
below
that
i
might
not
terrify
you
for
if
fritz
had
had
his
gun
i
might
have
been
shot
as
a
and
not
been
here
to
tell
you
my
story
the
good
mother
then
turned
her
thoughts
on
fritz
and
me
and
would
not
suffer
us
to
come
near
her
till
we
had
changed
our
drenched
garments
to
oblige
her
we
retired
to
a
little
closet
i
had
contrived
between
two
thick
branches
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
which
was
used
to
contain
our
chests
of
linen
our
dresses
and
our
provisions
our
dress
was
soon
changed
we
hung
up
the
wet
garments
and
i
returned
to
my
companion
who
was
suffering
from
her
foot
but
still
more
from
a
frightful
headache
she
had
a
burning
fever
i
concluded
that
bleeding
was
urgently
needed
but
commenced
by
assuaging
her
thirst
with
some
lemonade
i
then
opened
my
box
of
surgical
instruments
and
approached
the
opening
to
the
east
which
served
us
for
a
window
and
which
we
could
close
by
means
of
a
curtain
that
was
now
entirely
raised
to
give
air
to
our
dear
invalid
and
to
amuse
my
children
who
were
watching
the
storm
the
mighty
waves
that
broke
against
the
rocks
the
vivid
lightning
bursting
through
the
castles
of
murky
clouds
the
majestic
and
incessant
rolling
of
the
thunder
formed
one
of
those
enchanting
spectacles
to
which
they
had
been
from
infancy
accustomed
as
in
the
swiss
mountains
we
are
liable
to
frightful
storms
to
which
it
is
necessary
to
familiarize
oneself
as
one
can
not
avoid
them
i
had
accustomed
my
wife
and
children
by
my
own
example
to
behold
not
only
without
fear
but
even
with
admiration
these
great
shocks
of
the
elements
these
convulsions
of
nature
i
had
opened
the
chest
and
my
children
had
directed
their
attention
to
the
instruments
it
contained
the
first
were
a
little
rusty
and
i
handed
them
to
ernest
who
after
examining
them
placed
them
on
a
table
inside
the
window
i
was
searching
for
a
lancet
in
good
condition
when
a
clap
of
thunder
such
as
i
had
never
heard
in
my
life
terrified
us
all
so
much
that
we
nearly
fell
down
this
burst
of
thunder
had
not
been
preceded
by
any
lightning
but
was
accompanied
by
two
immense
forked
columns
of
fire
which
seemed
to
stretch
from
the
sky
to
our
very
feet
we
all
cried
out
even
my
poor
wife
but
the
silence
of
terror
succeeded
and
seemed
to
be
the
silence
of
death
i
flew
to
the
bedside
and
found
my
dear
patient
in
a
state
of
total
insensibility
i
was
convinced
that
she
was
dead
and
i
was
dumb
with
despair
i
was
roused
from
my
stupor
by
the
voice
of
my
children
i
then
remembered
that
i
had
not
lost
all
there
still
remained
duties
to
fulfil
and
affection
to
console
me
my
children
cried
i
extending
my
arms
to
them
come
and
comfort
your
unfortunate
father
come
and
lament
with
him
the
best
of
wives
and
mothers
terrified
at
the
appearance
of
their
mother
they
surrounded
her
bed
calling
on
her
in
piercing
accents
at
that
moment
i
saw
my
little
francis
was
missing
and
my
grief
was
augmented
by
the
fear
that
he
had
been
killed
by
the
lightning
i
hastily
turned
to
the
window
expecting
to
find
my
child
dead
and
our
dwelling
in
flames
fortunately
all
was
safe
but
in
my
distraction
i
scarcely
thanked
god
for
his
mercy
at
the
very
moment
even
when
he
graciously
restored
to
me
my
lost
treasures
francis
frightened
by
the
storm
had
hidden
himself
in
his
mother
bed
and
fallen
asleep
awaked
by
the
thunder
he
had
not
dared
to
move
fearing
it
announced
the
arrival
of
the
savages
but
at
last
the
cries
of
his
brothers
roused
him
and
raising
his
pretty
fair
head
supposing
his
mother
sleeping
he
flung
his
arms
round
her
neck
saying
wake
mamma
we
are
all
here
papa
my
brothers
and
the
storm
too
which
is
very
beautiful
but
frightens
me
open
your
eyes
mamma
look
at
the
bright
lightning
and
kiss
your
little
francis
either
his
sweet
voice
or
the
cries
of
her
elder
children
restored
her
faculties
she
gradually
recovered
and
called
me
to
her
the
excess
of
my
joy
threatened
to
be
almost
as
fatal
as
my
grief
with
difficulty
i
controlled
my
own
feelings
and
those
of
my
boys
and
after
i
had
sent
them
from
the
bed
i
ascertained
that
she
was
not
only
really
living
but
much
better
the
pulse
was
calm
and
the
fever
had
subsided
leaving
only
a
weakness
that
was
by
no
means
alarming
i
relinquished
joyfully
the
intention
of
bleeding
her
the
necessity
of
which
i
had
trembled
to
contemplate
and
contented
myself
with
employing
the
boys
to
prepare
a
cooling
mixture
composed
of
the
juice
of
the
lemon
of
barley
and
tamarinds
which
they
completed
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
their
mother
i
then
ordered
fritz
to
descend
to
the
yard
to
kill
a
fowl
pluck
and
boil
it
to
make
broth
a
wholesome
and
light
nourishment
for
our
dear
invalid
i
told
one
of
his
brothers
to
assist
him
and
jack
and
francis
frequently
employed
under
their
mother
were
ready
in
a
moment
ernest
alone
remained
quietly
on
his
seat
which
i
attributed
to
his
usual
indolence
and
tried
to
make
him
ashamed
of
it
ernest
said
i
you
are
not
very
anxious
to
oblige
your
mother
you
sit
as
if
the
thunderbolt
had
struck
you
it
has
indeed
rendered
me
unfit
to
be
of
any
service
to
my
good
mother
said
he
quietly
and
drawing
his
right
hand
from
under
his
waistcoat
he
showed
it
to
me
most
frightfully
black
and
burnt
this
dear
child
who
must
have
suffered
very
much
had
never
uttered
a
complaint
for
fear
of
alarming
his
mother
and
even
now
he
made
a
sign
to
me
to
be
silent
lest
she
should
hear
and
discover
the
truth
she
soon
however
fell
into
a
sleep
which
enabled
me
to
attend
to
poor
ernest
and
to
question
him
about
the
accident
i
learned
that
a
long
and
pointed
steel
instrument
which
he
was
examining
near
the
large
window
stooping
over
it
to
see
it
better
had
attracted
the
lightning
which
falling
partly
on
the
hand
in
which
he
held
it
had
caused
the
misfortune
there
were
traces
on
his
arm
of
the
electric
fire
and
his
hair
was
burnt
on
one
side
by
what
miracle
the
electric
fluid
had
been
diverted
and
how
we
dwelling
in
a
tree
had
been
preserved
from
a
sudden
and
general
conflagration
i
knew
not
my
son
assured
me
he
had
seen
the
fire
run
along
the
instrument
he
held
and
from
thence
fall
perpendicularly
to
the
earth
where
it
seemed
to
burst
with
a
second
explosion
i
was
impatient
to
examine
this
phenomenon
and
to
see
if
any
other
traces
were
left
except
those
on
the
hand
of
my
son
which
it
was
necessary
in
the
first
place
to
attend
to
i
remembered
frequently
to
have
applied
with
success
in
burns
the
most
simple
and
easy
of
remedies
which
everybody
can
command
this
is
to
bathe
the
hand
affected
in
cold
water
taking
care
to
renew
it
every
eight
or
ten
minutes
i
placed
ernest
between
two
tubs
of
cold
water
and
exhorting
him
to
patience
and
perseverance
i
left
him
to
bathe
his
hand
and
approached
the
opening
to
try
and
discover
what
had
preserved
us
by
averting
the
direction
of
the
lightning
which
one
might
have
expected
would
have
killed
my
son
and
destroyed
our
dwelling
i
saw
only
some
light
traces
on
the
table
but
on
looking
more
attentively
i
found
that
the
greater
part
of
the
surgical
instruments
which
ernest
had
placed
upon
it
were
either
melted
or
much
damaged
in
examining
them
separately
i
remarked
one
much
longer
than
the
rest
which
projected
beyond
the
edge
of
the
table
and
was
much
marked
by
the
fire
i
could
not
easily
take
it
up
it
had
adhered
somewhat
in
melting
and
in
endeavouring
to
disengage
it
i
saw
that
the
point
which
was
beyond
the
opening
touched
a
thick
wire
which
seemed
to
be
suspended
from
the
roof
of
our
tent
all
was
now
explained
to
me
except
that
i
could
in
no
way
account
for
this
wire
placed
expressly
to
serve
as
a
conductor
for
the
lightning
it
seemed
to
be
the
work
of
magic
the
evening
was
too
far
advanced
for
me
to
distinguish
how
it
was
fastened
and
what
fixed
it
below
therefore
enjoining
ernest
to
call
loudly
if
he
needed
me
i
hastened
down
i
saw
my
three
cooks
very
busy
as
i
passed
through
preparing
the
broth
for
their
mother
they
assured
me
it
would
be
excellent
fritz
boasted
that
he
had
killed
the
fowl
with
all
speed
jack
that
he
had
plucked
it
without
tearing
it
much
and
francis
that
he
had
lighted
and
kept
up
the
fire
they
had
nothing
to
employ
them
just
then
and
i
took
them
with
me
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
on
the
phenomenon
of
the
lightning
below
the
window
i
found
a
large
packet
of
iron
wire
which
i
had
brought
from
tent
house
some
days
before
intending
on
some
leisure
day
to
make
a
sort
of
grating
before
our
by
what
chance
was
it
here
and
hooked
by
one
end
to
the
roof
of
our
house
some
time
before
i
had
replaced
our
cloth
canopy
by
a
sort
of
roof
covered
with
bark
nailed
upon
laths
the
cloth
still
enclosed
the
sides
and
front
all
was
so
inflammable
that
but
for
the
providential
conductor
we
must
have
been
in
flames
in
an
instant
i
thanked
god
for
our
preservation
and
little
francis
seeing
me
so
happy
said
is
it
quite
true
papa
that
this
wire
has
preserved
us
yes
it
is
true
my
darling
and
i
wish
to
know
what
good
genius
has
placed
it
there
that
i
may
be
thankful
said
i
ah
father
said
my
little
fellow
embrace
me
but
do
not
thank
me
for
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
doing
good
astonished
at
this
information
i
requested
my
boy
to
tell
me
why
and
how
he
had
fixed
the
wire
i
wanted
to
reach
some
figs
said
he
when
you
and
fritz
were
at
tent
house
and
jack
and
ernest
were
nursing
mamma
i
wished
to
do
some
good
for
her
i
thought
she
would
like
some
of
our
sweet
figs
but
there
were
none
in
my
reach
and
i
had
no
stick
long
enough
to
beat
them
down
i
went
below
and
found
that
great
roll
of
wire
i
tried
to
break
a
piece
off
but
could
not
and
i
then
determined
to
carry
the
whole
up
to
our
dwelling
and
to
bend
one
end
into
a
hook
by
which
i
might
catch
some
of
the
branches
and
bring
them
near
me
to
gather
the
figs
i
was
very
successful
at
first
and
secured
one
or
two
figs
i
had
my
packet
of
wire
on
the
table
by
the
window
and
stood
near
it
myself
i
thought
i
could
reach
a
branch
that
hung
over
our
roof
loaded
with
fruit
i
leaned
forward
and
extended
my
hook
to
the
branch
i
felt
i
had
secured
it
and
joyfully
began
to
pull
you
know
papa
they
bend
and
break
but
it
remained
immovable
as
well
as
my
hook
which
was
held
by
one
of
the
laths
of
the
roof
i
pulled
with
all
my
strength
and
in
my
efforts
i
struck
my
foot
against
the
roll
of
wire
which
fell
down
to
the
ground
without
detaching
the
hook
you
may
judge
how
firm
it
is
for
it
is
no
trifling
leap
from
our
house
to
the
ground
a
good
work
indeed
my
boy
said
i
is
yours
for
it
has
saved
us
god
has
inspired
you
and
has
made
use
of
the
hand
of
a
child
for
our
preservation
your
conductor
shall
remain
where
you
have
so
happily
placed
it
we
may
still
have
need
of
it
the
sky
still
looks
very
threatening
let
us
return
to
your
mother
and
take
a
light
with
us
i
had
contrived
a
sort
of
portable
lantern
made
of
isinglass
which
lighted
us
in
our
offices
moreover
a
calibash
pierced
with
small
holes
with
a
candle
inside
was
placed
at
the
top
of
the
winding
staircase
and
lighted
it
entirely
so
that
we
were
able
to
descend
without
danger
by
night
as
w
ell
as
by
day
i
was
however
uneasy
about
the
way
we
should
bring
my
wife
down
if
we
found
it
necessary
to
remove
her
during
her
sickness
i
named
it
to
fritz
have
no
uneasiness
father
said
he
ernest
and
i
are
very
strong
now
and
we
can
carry
mamma
like
a
feather
you
and
i
might
my
dear
boy
said
i
but
ernest
can
not
be
of
much
assistance
to
us
at
present
i
then
related
his
misfortune
to
them
they
were
distressed
and
astonished
not
comprehending
the
cause
which
i
promised
to
explain
they
wished
now
however
to
see
their
brother
fritz
then
requested
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
that
he
might
go
to
tent
house
to
see
if
the
vessel
and
the
captain
had
arrived
seeing
his
brothers
listening
with
curiosity
i
thought
it
best
to
tell
them
the
affair
requesting
them
however
not
to
name
it
to
their
mother
at
present
jack
who
was
now
about
fourteen
years
of
age
listened
with
the
most
intense
interest
his
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
and
surprise
a
vessel
people
from
europe
do
you
think
they
have
come
to
seek
us
perhaps
they
are
our
relations
and
friends
how
glad
should
i
be
said
francis
if
my
good
grandmamma
were
there
she
loved
me
so
much
and
was
always
giving
me
sweetmeats
this
was
the
mother
of
my
dear
wife
from
whom
she
had
parted
with
extreme
regret
i
knew
that
a
single
word
from
the
child
would
have
revived
all
her
sorrows
and
would
in
her
present
state
be
dangerous
i
therefore
forbade
him
naming
such
a
thing
to
his
mother
even
if
we
mentioned
the
vessel
we
ascended
and
found
our
dear
patient
awake
with
ernest
at
her
side
his
hand
tied
up
and
somewhat
relieved
though
from
not
having
applied
the
water
immediately
there
were
several
blisters
which
he
requested
me
to
open
it
was
necessary
to
tell
his
mother
he
had
had
a
burn
she
named
several
remedies
and
i
was
hesitating
which
to
use
when
fritz
giving
me
a
significant
glance
said
do
you
think
father
that
the
leaves
of
the
karata
which
cured
jack
leg
so
well
would
be
is
serviceable
to
ernest
hand
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
said
i
but
we
have
none
here
i
know
very
well
where
they
grow
said
he
come
jack
we
shall
soon
be
there
we
shall
have
a
little
rain
but
what
of
that
we
shall
not
be
melted
and
we
can
have
a
bath
my
wife
was
divided
between
her
desire
to
relieve
ernest
and
her
fear
of
the
boys
venturing
out
in
such
a
stormy
night
she
agreed
at
last
provided
jack
had
my
cloak
and
fritz
the
boots
and
that
they
should
take
the
lantern
thus
equipped
they
set
out
i
accompanied
them
outside
the
tree
fritz
assuring
me
they
would
be
back
in
three
hours
at
most
he
intended
to
proceed
along
the
rocks
towards
tent
house
to
make
what
observations
he
could
for
as
he
told
me
he
could
not
get
the
poor
captain
and
his
vessel
out
of
his
head
it
was
now
seven
i
gave
them
my
blessing
and
left
them
with
injunctions
to
be
prudent
and
returned
with
an
anxious
heart
to
my
invalids
chapter
xxxv
on
entering
i
found
francis
sitting
on
his
mother
bed
telling
her
the
story
of
the
lightning
of
the
wire
which
was
called
of
the
figs
that
he
was
going
to
gather
for
her
and
that
papa
had
called
him
little
francis
preserver
of
the
whole
having
briefly
explained
to
them
the
results
of
francis
fortunate
device
i
procured
some
raw
potato
to
apply
to
ernest
hand
which
still
gave
him
great
pain
and
bathed
my
wife
foot
with
some
which
i
procured
from
my
here
i
also
met
with
some
laudanum
a
few
drops
of
which
i
infused
into
the
lemonade
wishing
her
to
sleep
till
her
sons
returned
she
soon
was
in
a
sweet
slumber
the
boys
followed
her
example
and
i
was
left
alone
with
my
anxieties
happy
however
to
see
them
at
rest
after
such
an
evening
of
agitation
the
hours
passed
still
my
children
returned
not
i
was
continually
at
the
window
listening
for
their
steps
or
the
sound
of
their
voices
i
heard
only
the
rain
falling
in
torrents
the
waves
breaking
against
the
rocks
and
the
wind
howling
frightfully
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
danger
they
ran
having
twice
to
cross
the
river
which
was
doubtless
swoln
by
the
rain
i
was
not
so
much
alarmed
for
fritz
a
strong
bold
youth
of
nineteen
years
of
age
and
a
determined
hunter
as
for
poor
jack
bold
even
to
rashness
and
having
neither
strength
nor
experience
to
secure
him
i
could
not
help
fancying
him
carried
away
by
the
stream
and
his
brother
not
daring
to
return
without
him
my
wife
occasionally
awoke
but
the
narcotic
stupified
her
she
did
not
perceive
the
absence
of
her
sons
francis
slept
tranquilly
but
when
ernest
awoke
and
heard
the
tempest
so
terribly
augmented
he
was
almost
distracted
all
his
selfishness
all
his
indolence
disappeared
he
entreated
me
to
allow
him
to
go
in
search
of
his
brothers
and
with
difficulty
i
detained
him
to
convince
him
that
he
was
not
the
sole
cause
of
the
danger
of
fritz
and
jack
i
related
to
him
for
the
first
time
the
history
of
the
boat
and
the
vessel
and
assured
him
that
the
great
cause
of
their
anxiety
to
go
over
to
tent
house
was
to
search
for
some
traces
of
the
unfortunate
seamen
and
their
vessel
exposed
to
that
furious
sea
and
fritz
also
is
exposed
to
that
sea
cried
ernest
i
know
it
i
am
sure
that
he
is
at
this
moment
in
his
canoe
struggling
against
the
waves
and
jack
my
poor
jack
sighed
i
infected
with
his
fears
no
father
added
ernest
be
composed
fritz
will
not
be
so
imprudent
he
will
have
left
jack
in
our
house
at
the
rock
and
probably
seeing
the
hopelessness
of
his
undertaking
he
is
returned
himself
now
and
is
waiting
there
till
the
stream
subsides
a
little
do
allow
me
to
go
dear
father
you
have
ordered
me
cold
water
for
my
burnt
hand
and
it
will
certainly
cure
it
to
get
well
wet
i
could
not
consent
to
expose
my
third
son
to
the
tempest
which
was
now
become
frightful
the
sailcloth
which
covered
our
window
was
torn
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
carried
away
the
rain
like
a
deluge
forced
itself
into
our
dwelling
even
to
the
bed
where
my
wife
and
child
were
lying
i
could
neither
make
up
my
mind
to
leave
them
myself
in
this
perilous
situation
nor
to
spare
my
boy
who
could
not
even
be
of
any
use
to
his
brothers
i
commanded
him
to
remain
succeeded
in
persuading
him
of
their
probable
safety
and
induced
him
to
lie
down
to
rest
now
in
my
terrible
solitude
i
turned
to
him
who
tempers
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
who
forbids
us
not
to
address
him
in
the
trials
he
sends
us
to
beseech
him
to
soften
them
or
to
give
us
strength
to
bear
them
kneeling
down
i
dared
to
supplicate
him
to
restore
me
my
children
submissively
adding
after
the
example
of
our
blessed
saviour
yet
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
o
lord
my
prayers
appeared
to
be
heard
the
storm
gradually
abated
and
the
day
began
to
break
i
awoke
ernest
and
having
dressed
his
wounded
hand
he
set
out
for
tent
house
in
search
of
his
brothers
i
followed
him
with
my
eyes
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
whole
country
appeared
one
vast
lake
and
the
road
to
tent
house
was
like
the
bed
of
a
river
but
protected
by
his
good
gaiters
of
he
proceeded
fearlessly
and
was
soon
out
of
my
sight
i
was
recalled
from
the
window
by
the
voice
of
my
wife
who
was
awake
and
anxiously
inquiring
for
her
sons
they
are
gone
said
i
to
gather
the
leaves
of
the
karata
for
ernest
burnt
hand
and
he
wished
to
go
too
her
deep
sleep
had
entirely
chased
from
her
memory
all
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
and
i
was
glad
to
allow
francis
to
repeat
his
little
tale
of
the
burn
and
his
in
order
to
gain
time
she
was
astonished
and
uneasy
to
hear
of
ernest
accident
and
was
afraid
they
would
in
searching
for
the
karata
little
aware
of
the
hours
of
anguish
i
had
endured
waiting
and
watching
for
those
she
believed
had
only
just
left
home
at
that
moment
the
dear
and
voices
were
heard
under
the
great
window
father
i
am
bringing
back
my
brothers
cried
ernest
yes
papa
we
are
all
alive
and
as
wet
as
fishes
added
the
sweet
voice
of
jack
but
not
without
having
had
our
troubles
said
the
manly
voice
of
fritz
i
rushed
down
the
staircase
to
meet
them
and
embracing
them
i
led
them
trembling
with
emotion
to
the
bed
of
their
mother
who
could
not
comprehend
the
transport
of
joy
i
expressed
dear
elizabeth
said
i
here
are
our
sons
god
has
given
them
to
us
a
second
time
have
we
then
been
in
any
danger
of
losing
them
said
she
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
they
saw
their
mother
was
unconscious
of
their
long
absence
and
assured
her
it
was
only
the
storm
which
had
so
completely
wetted
them
that
had
alarmed
me
i
hastened
to
get
them
to
change
their
clothes
and
go
to
bed
a
little
while
to
rest
themselves
as
however
anxious
i
was
myself
i
wished
to
prepare
my
wife
for
their
recital
and
also
to
tell
her
of
the
vessel
jack
would
not
go
till
he
had
produced
his
bundle
of
the
karata
leaves
there
is
enough
for
thunderstorms
said
he
and
i
will
prepare
them
i
have
had
some
experience
with
my
own
and
i
know
the
best
method
he
soon
divided
one
of
the
leaves
with
his
knife
after
cutting
away
the
triangular
thorn
from
the
end
and
applied
it
to
his
brother
hand
binding
it
with
his
handkerchief
having
completed
this
dressing
he
threw
off
his
clothes
and
jumping
into
his
bed
he
and
his
brothers
were
sound
asleep
in
ten
minutes
i
then
sat
down
by
my
wife
and
began
my
tale
from
my
first
view
of
the
vessel
and
my
anxious
watching
for
intercourse
with
it
in
order
that
we
might
take
the
opportunity
to
return
to
europe
but
why
should
we
return
to
europe
said
she
we
want
nothing
here
now
since
i
have
got
flax
cotton
and
a
wheel
our
children
lead
an
active
healthy
and
innocent
life
and
live
which
they
might
not
do
in
the
world
for
four
years
we
have
been
happy
here
and
what
shall
we
find
in
europe
to
compensate
us
for
what
we
leave
here
poverty
war
and
none
of
those
things
which
we
have
here
abundantly
but
we
should
find
grandmamma
said
little
francis
and
stopped
recollecting
my
prohibition
he
had
however
said
sufficient
to
bring
tears
to
his
mother
eyes
you
are
right
my
darling
said
she
that
is
my
sole
regret
but
my
dear
parent
was
aged
and
infirm
in
all
probability
i
should
no
longer
find
her
in
this
world
and
if
removed
to
heaven
she
watches
over
us
in
this
island
as
well
as
if
we
were
in
europe
after
my
dear
wife
had
subdued
the
agitation
this
remembrance
caused
her
i
pursued
the
conversation
as
follows
chapter
xxxvi
i
see
my
dear
wife
said
i
that
you
as
well
as
the
rest
of
my
family
are
contented
to
remain
on
this
island
where
it
seems
it
is
the
will
of
god
for
us
to
dwell
as
it
is
improbable
that
in
such
a
tempest
captain
johnson
would
risk
approaching
the
island
if
indeed
it
has
not
been
already
fatal
to
him
i
am
impatient
to
learn
if
fritz
has
any
tidings
of
him
for
it
was
on
the
shore
near
tent
house
that
he
and
jack
passed
the
night
well
done
my
good
and
courageous
boys
said
their
mother
they
might
at
any
rate
have
given
assistance
to
them
if
wrecked
you
are
more
courageous
than
i
am
my
dear
elizabeth
answered
i
i
have
passed
the
whole
night
mourning
for
my
children
and
you
think
only
of
the
good
they
might
have
done
to
their
my
sons
were
awake
by
this
time
and
i
eagerly
inquired
if
they
had
discovered
any
traces
of
the
vessel
fritz
said
they
had
not
but
he
feared
it
would
never
be
able
to
resist
the
fury
of
the
tempest
no
indeed
said
jack
those
mountains
of
waves
which
were
not
fixtures
like
other
mountains
came
full
gallop
to
swallow
up
fritz
the
great
jack
the
little
and
their
fine
canoe
my
wife
nearly
fainted
when
she
heard
they
had
ventured
on
that
terrible
sea
and
i
reminded
fritz
that
i
had
forbidden
him
to
do
this
but
you
have
often
said
to
me
papa
said
he
do
unto
others
as
you
would
they
should
do
unto
you
and
what
a
happiness
it
would
have
been
to
us
when
our
vessel
was
wrecked
if
we
had
seen
a
canoe
with
two
bold
men
coming
to
our
assistance
said
jack
but
go
on
with
your
story
fritz
fritz
continued
we
proceeded
first
to
the
rocks
and
with
some
difficulty
and
not
until
jack
had
shed
some
blood
in
the
cause
we
secured
the
with
their
ugly
thorns
at
the
end
when
our
sack
was
full
we
proceeded
along
the
rocks
towards
tent
house
from
this
height
i
tried
to
discover
the
ship
but
the
darkness
obscured
everything
once
i
thought
i
perceived
at
a
great
distance
a
fixed
light
which
was
neither
a
star
nor
the
lightning
and
which
i
lost
sight
of
occasionally
we
had
now
arrived
at
the
cascade
which
from
the
noise
seemed
much
swollen
by
the
rain
our
great
stones
were
quite
hidden
by
a
boiling
foam
i
would
have
attempted
to
cross
if
i
had
been
alone
but
with
jack
on
my
shoulders
i
was
afraid
of
the
risk
i
therefore
prepared
to
follow
the
course
of
the
river
to
family
bridge
the
wet
ground
continually
brought
us
on
our
knees
and
with
great
difficulty
we
reached
the
bridge
but
judge
of
our
consternation
the
river
had
risen
so
much
that
the
planks
were
covered
and
as
we
conceived
the
whole
was
destroyed
i
then
told
jack
to
return
to
falcon
nest
with
the
and
i
would
swim
across
the
river
i
returned
about
a
hundred
yards
up
the
stream
to
find
a
wider
and
less
rapid
part
and
easily
crossed
judge
of
my
surprise
when
i
saw
a
human
figure
approaching
to
meet
me
i
had
no
doubt
it
was
the
captain
of
the
vessel
and
and
it
was
captain
jack
peur
et
sans
said
the
bold
little
fellow
i
was
determined
not
to
return
home
a
poltroon
who
was
afraid
of
the
water
when
fritz
was
gone
i
tried
the
bridge
and
soon
found
there
was
not
sufficient
water
over
it
to
risk
my
being
drowned
i
took
off
my
boots
which
might
have
made
me
slip
and
my
cloak
which
was
too
heavy
and
making
a
dart
i
ran
with
all
my
strength
across
and
reached
the
other
side
i
put
on
my
boots
which
i
had
in
my
hands
and
advanced
to
meet
fritz
who
called
out
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
is
it
you
captain
i
tried
to
say
yes
certainly
in
a
deep
tone
but
my
laughter
betrayed
me
to
my
great
regret
said
fritz
i
should
truly
have
preferred
meeting
captain
johnson
but
i
fear
he
and
his
people
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
after
meeting
with
jack
we
proceeded
to
tent
house
where
we
kindled
a
good
fire
and
dried
ourselves
a
little
we
then
refreshed
ourselves
with
some
wine
which
remained
on
the
table
where
you
had
entertained
the
captain
and
proceeded
to
prepare
a
signal
to
inform
the
vessel
we
were
ready
to
receive
them
we
procured
a
thick
bamboo
cane
from
the
magazine
i
fixed
firmly
to
one
end
of
it
the
large
lantern
of
the
fish
bladder
you
gave
us
to
take
i
filled
the
lamp
with
oil
and
placed
in
it
a
thick
which
when
lighted
was
very
brilliant
jack
and
i
then
placed
it
on
the
shore
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
we
fixed
it
before
the
rock
where
the
would
not
reach
it
sunk
it
three
or
four
feet
into
the
ground
steadied
it
with
stones
and
then
went
to
rest
over
our
fire
after
this
long
and
difficult
labour
after
drying
ourselves
a
little
we
set
out
on
our
return
when
looking
towards
the
sea
we
were
startled
by
the
appearance
of
the
same
light
we
had
noticed
before
we
heard
at
the
same
time
the
distant
report
of
a
gun
which
was
repeated
three
or
four
times
at
irregular
intervals
we
were
persuaded
that
it
was
the
vessel
calling
to
us
for
aid
and
remembering
the
command
of
our
saviour
we
thought
you
would
forgive
our
disobedience
if
we
presented
to
you
in
the
morning
the
captain
the
lieutenant
and
as
many
as
our
canoe
would
contain
we
entered
it
then
without
any
fear
for
you
know
how
light
and
it
is
and
rowing
into
the
bay
the
sail
was
spread
to
the
wind
and
we
had
no
more
trouble
i
then
took
the
helm
my
own
shone
clearly
on
the
shore
and
for
the
rain
which
fell
in
torrents
the
waves
which
washed
over
our
canoe
and
uneasiness
about
the
ship
and
about
you
and
our
fear
that
the
wind
might
carry
us
into
the
open
sea
we
should
have
had
a
delightful
little
maritime
excursion
when
we
got
out
of
the
bay
i
perceived
the
wind
was
driving
us
towards
shark
island
which
being
directly
before
the
bay
forms
two
entrances
to
it
i
intended
to
go
round
it
and
disembark
there
if
possible
that
i
might
look
out
for
some
trace
of
the
ship
but
we
found
this
impossible
the
sea
ran
too
high
besides
we
should
have
been
unable
to
moor
our
canoe
the
island
not
affording
a
single
tree
or
anything
we
could
lash
it
to
and
the
waves
would
soon
have
carried
it
away
we
had
now
lost
sight
of
the
light
and
hearing
no
more
signals
i
began
to
think
on
your
distress
when
we
did
not
arrive
at
the
hour
we
promised
i
therefore
resolved
to
return
by
the
other
side
of
the
bay
carefully
avoiding
the
current
which
would
have
carried
us
into
the
open
sea
i
lowered
the
sail
by
means
of
the
ropes
you
had
fixed
to
it
and
we
rowed
into
port
we
carefully
moored
the
canoe
and
without
returning
to
tent
house
took
the
road
home
we
crossed
the
bridge
as
jack
had
done
found
the
waterproof
cloak
and
bag
of
where
he
had
left
them
and
soon
after
met
ernest
as
it
was
daylight
i
did
not
take
him
for
the
captain
but
knew
him
immediately
and
felt
the
deepest
remorse
when
i
heard
from
him
in
what
anxiety
and
anguish
you
had
passed
the
night
our
enterprise
was
imprudent
and
altogether
useless
but
we
might
have
saved
life
which
would
have
been
an
ample
remuneration
i
fear
all
is
hopeless
what
do
you
think
father
of
their
fate
i
hope
they
are
far
from
this
dangerous
coast
said
i
but
if
still
in
our
neighbourhood
we
will
do
all
we
can
to
assist
them
as
soon
as
the
tempest
is
subsided
we
will
take
the
pinnace
and
sail
round
the
island
you
have
long
urged
me
to
this
fritz
and
who
knows
but
on
the
opposite
side
we
may
find
some
traces
of
our
own
poor
sailors
perhaps
even
meet
with
them
the
weather
gradually
clearing
i
called
my
sons
to
go
out
with
me
my
wife
earnestly
besought
me
not
to
venture
on
the
sea
i
assured
her
it
was
not
sufficiently
calm
but
we
must
examine
our
plantations
to
ascertain
what
damage
was
done
and
at
the
same
time
we
might
look
out
for
some
traces
of
the
wreck
besides
our
animals
were
becoming
clamorous
for
food
therefore
leaving
ernest
with
her
we
descended
to
administer
in
the
first
place
to
their
wants
chapter
xxxvii
our
animals
were
impatiently
expecting
us
they
had
been
neglected
during
the
storm
and
were
with
food
besides
being
in
water
the
ducks
and
the
flamingo
liked
it
well
enough
and
were
swimming
comfortably
in
the
muddy
water
but
the
quadrupeds
were
complaining
aloud
each
in
his
own
proper
language
and
making
a
frightful
confusion
of
sounds
especially
the
name
francis
had
bestowed
on
the
calf
i
had
given
him
to
bring
up
bleated
incessantly
for
his
young
master
and
could
not
be
quieted
till
he
came
it
is
wonderful
how
this
child
only
twelve
years
old
had
tamed
and
attached
this
animal
though
sometimes
so
fierce
with
him
he
was
mild
as
a
lamb
the
boy
rode
on
his
back
guiding
him
with
a
little
stick
with
which
he
just
touched
the
side
of
his
neck
as
he
wished
him
to
move
but
if
his
brothers
had
ventured
to
mount
they
would
have
been
certainly
thrown
off
a
pretty
sight
was
our
cavalry
fritz
on
his
handsome
onagra
jack
on
his
huge
buffalo
and
francis
on
his
young
bull
there
was
nothing
left
for
ernest
but
the
donkey
and
its
slow
and
peaceful
habits
suited
him
very
well
francis
ran
up
to
his
favourite
who
showed
his
delight
at
seeing
him
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
at
the
first
summons
followed
his
master
from
the
stable
fritz
brought
out
jack
his
buffalo
and
i
followed
with
the
cow
and
the
ass
we
left
them
to
sport
about
at
liberty
on
the
humid
earth
till
we
removed
the
water
from
their
stable
and
supplied
them
with
fresh
food
we
then
drove
them
in
considering
it
advisable
to
pursue
our
expedition
on
foot
lest
the
bridge
should
still
be
overflowed
francis
was
the
superintendent
of
the
fowls
and
knew
every
little
chicken
by
name
he
called
them
out
and
scattered
their
food
for
them
and
soon
had
his
beautiful
and
noisy
family
fluttering
round
him
after
having
made
all
our
animals
comfortable
and
given
them
their
breakfast
we
began
to
think
of
our
own
francis
made
a
fire
and
warmed
some
chicken
broth
for
his
mother
for
ourselves
we
were
contented
with
some
new
milk
some
salt
herrings
and
cold
potatoes
i
had
often
searched
in
my
excursions
for
the
precious
tree
so
highly
spoken
of
by
modern
travellers
which
i
had
hoped
might
be
found
in
our
island
from
its
favourable
situation
but
i
had
hitherto
been
unsuccessful
we
were
unable
to
procure
the
blessing
of
our
ship
biscuit
had
long
been
exhausted
and
though
we
had
sown
our
european
corn
we
had
not
yet
reaped
any
after
we
had
together
knelt
down
to
thank
god
for
his
merciful
protection
through
the
terrors
of
the
past
night
and
besought
him
to
continue
it
we
prepared
to
set
out
the
waves
still
ran
high
though
the
wind
had
subsided
and
we
determined
merely
to
go
along
the
shore
as
the
roads
still
continued
impassable
from
the
rain
and
the
sand
was
easier
to
walk
on
than
the
wet
grass
besides
our
principal
motive
for
the
excursion
was
to
search
for
any
traces
of
a
recent
shipwreck
at
first
we
could
discover
nothing
even
with
the
telescope
but
fritz
mounting
a
high
rock
fancied
he
discovered
something
floating
towards
the
island
he
besought
me
to
allow
him
to
take
the
canoe
which
was
still
where
he
left
it
the
preceding
night
as
the
bridge
was
now
easy
to
cross
i
consented
only
insisting
on
accompanying
him
to
assist
in
managing
it
jack
who
was
much
afraid
of
being
left
behind
was
the
first
to
leap
in
and
seize
an
oar
there
was
however
no
need
of
it
i
steered
my
little
boat
into
the
current
and
we
were
carried
away
with
such
velocity
as
almost
to
take
our
breath
fritz
was
at
the
helm
and
appeared
to
have
no
fear
i
will
not
say
that
his
father
was
so
tranquil
i
held
jack
for
fear
of
accidents
but
he
only
laughed
and
observed
to
his
brother
that
the
canoe
galloped
better
than
lightfoot
we
were
soon
in
the
open
sea
and
directed
our
canoe
towards
the
object
we
had
remarked
and
which
we
still
had
in
sight
we
were
afraid
it
was
the
boat
upset
but
it
proved
to
be
a
tolerably
large
cask
which
had
probably
been
thrown
overboard
to
lighten
the
distressed
vessel
we
saw
several
others
but
neither
mast
nor
plank
to
give
us
any
idea
that
the
vessel
and
boat
had
perished
fritz
wished
much
to
have
made
the
circuit
of
the
island
to
assure
ourselves
of
this
but
i
would
not
hear
of
it
i
thought
of
my
wife
terror
besides
the
sea
was
still
too
rough
for
our
frail
bark
and
we
had
moreover
no
provisions
if
my
canoe
had
not
been
well
built
it
would
have
run
great
risk
of
being
overset
by
the
waves
which
broke
over
it
jack
when
he
saw
one
coming
lay
down
on
his
face
saying
he
preferred
having
them
on
his
back
rather
than
in
his
mouth
he
jumped
up
as
soon
as
it
passed
to
help
to
empty
the
canoe
till
another
wave
came
to
fill
it
again
but
thanks
to
my
we
preserved
our
balance
very
well
and
i
consented
to
go
as
far
as
which
merited
the
name
a
second
time
for
we
found
no
trace
here
of
the
vessel
though
we
mounted
the
hill
and
thus
commanded
a
wide
extent
of
view
as
we
looked
round
the
country
it
appeared
completely
devastated
trees
torn
up
by
the
roots
plantations
levelled
with
the
ground
water
collected
into
absolute
lakes
all
announced
desolation
and
the
tempest
seemed
to
be
renewing
the
sky
was
darkened
the
wind
arose
and
was
unfavourable
for
our
return
nor
could
i
venture
the
canoe
on
the
waves
every
instant
becoming
more
formidable
we
moored
our
bark
to
a
large
we
found
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
near
the
shore
and
set
out
by
land
to
our
home
we
crossed
the
gourd
wood
and
the
wood
of
monkeys
and
arrived
at
our
farm
which
we
found
to
our
great
satisfaction
had
not
suffered
much
from
the
storm
the
food
we
had
left
in
the
stables
was
nearly
consumed
from
which
we
concluded
that
the
animals
we
had
left
here
had
sheltered
themselves
during
the
storm
we
refilled
the
mangers
with
the
hay
we
had
preserved
in
the
loft
and
observing
the
sky
getting
more
and
more
threatening
we
set
out
without
delay
for
our
house
from
which
we
were
yet
a
considerable
distance
to
avoid
which
was
towards
the
sea
and
towards
the
rock
we
determined
to
go
through
which
would
save
us
from
the
wind
which
was
ready
to
blow
us
off
our
feet
i
was
still
uneasy
about
the
ship
which
the
lieutenant
had
told
me
was
out
of
repair
but
i
indulged
a
hope
that
they
might
have
taken
refuge
in
some
bay
or
found
anchorage
on
some
hospitable
shore
where
they
might
get
their
vessel
into
order
jack
was
alarmed
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
who
eat
men
like
hares
or
sheep
of
whom
he
had
read
in
some
book
of
travels
and
excited
the
ridicule
of
his
brother
who
was
astonished
at
his
ready
belief
of
travellers
tales
which
he
asserted
were
usually
false
but
robinson
crusoe
would
not
tell
a
falsehood
said
jack
indignantly
and
there
were
cannibals
came
to
his
island
and
were
going
to
eat
friday
if
he
had
not
saved
him
oh
robinson
could
not
tell
a
falsehood
said
fritz
because
he
never
existed
the
whole
history
is
a
romance
is
not
that
the
name
father
that
is
given
to
works
of
the
imagination
it
is
said
i
but
we
must
not
call
robinson
crusoe
a
romance
though
robinson
himself
and
all
the
circumstances
of
his
history
are
probably
fictitious
the
details
are
all
founded
on
truth
on
the
adventures
and
descriptions
of
voyagers
who
may
be
depended
on
and
unfortunate
individuals
who
have
actually
been
wrecked
on
unknown
shores
if
ever
our
journal
should
be
printed
many
may
believe
that
it
is
only
a
romance
a
mere
work
of
the
imagination
my
boys
hoped
we
should
not
have
to
introduce
any
savages
into
our
romance
and
were
astonished
that
an
island
so
beautiful
had
not
tempted
any
to
inhabit
it
in
fact
i
had
often
been
myself
surprised
at
this
circumstance
but
i
told
them
many
voyagers
had
noticed
islands
apparently
fertile
and
yet
uninhabited
besides
the
chain
of
rocks
which
surrounded
this
might
prevent
the
approach
of
savages
unless
they
had
discovered
the
little
of
where
we
had
landed
fritz
said
he
anxiously
desired
to
circumnavigate
the
island
in
order
to
ascertain
the
size
of
it
and
if
there
were
similar
chains
of
rocks
on
the
opposite
side
i
promised
him
as
soon
as
the
stormy
weather
was
past
and
his
mother
well
enough
to
remove
to
tent
house
we
would
take
our
pinnace
and
set
out
on
our
little
voyage
we
now
approached
the
marsh
and
he
begged
me
to
let
him
go
and
cut
some
canes
as
he
projected
making
a
sort
of
carriage
for
his
mother
as
we
were
collecting
them
he
explained
his
scheme
to
me
he
wished
to
weave
of
these
reeds
which
were
very
strong
a
large
and
long
sort
of
pannier
in
which
his
mother
might
sit
or
recline
and
which
might
be
suspended
between
two
strong
by
handles
of
rope
he
then
purposed
to
yoke
two
of
our
most
gentle
animals
the
cow
and
the
ass
the
one
before
and
the
other
behind
between
these
shafts
the
leader
to
be
mounted
by
one
of
the
children
as
director
the
other
would
follow
naturally
and
the
good
mother
would
thus
be
carried
as
if
in
a
litter
without
any
danger
of
jolting
i
was
pleased
with
this
idea
and
we
all
set
to
work
to
load
ourselves
each
with
a
huge
burden
of
reeds
they
requested
me
not
to
tell
my
wife
that
they
might
give
her
an
agreeable
surprise
it
needed
such
affection
as
ours
to
induce
us
to
the
undertaking
in
such
unpropitious
weather
it
rained
in
torrents
and
the
marsh
was
so
soft
and
wet
that
we
were
in
danger
of
sinking
at
every
step
however
i
could
not
be
less
courageous
than
my
sons
whom
nothing
daunted
and
we
soon
made
up
our
bundles
and
placing
them
on
our
heads
they
formed
a
sort
of
umbrella
which
was
not
without
its
benefits
we
soon
arrived
at
falcon
nest
before
we
reached
the
tree
i
saw
a
fire
shine
to
such
a
distance
that
i
was
alarmed
but
soon
found
it
was
only
meant
for
our
benefit
by
our
kind
friends
at
home
when
my
wife
saw
the
rain
falling
she
had
instructed
her
little
assistant
to
make
a
fire
in
our
usual
at
a
little
distance
from
the
tree
and
protected
by
a
canopy
of
waterproof
cloth
from
the
rain
the
young
cook
had
not
only
kept
up
a
good
fire
to
dry
us
on
our
return
but
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
roasting
two
dozen
of
those
excellent
little
birds
which
his
mother
had
preserved
in
butter
and
which
all
ranged
on
the
old
sword
which
served
us
for
a
spit
were
just
ready
on
our
arrival
and
the
fire
and
feast
were
equally
grateful
to
the
hungry
exhausted
and
wet
travellers
who
sat
down
to
enjoy
them
however
before
we
sat
down
to
our
repast
we
went
up
to
see
our
invalids
whom
we
found
tolerably
well
though
anxious
for
our
return
ernest
with
his
sound
hand
and
the
assistance
of
francis
had
succeeded
in
forming
a
sort
of
before
the
opening
into
the
room
composed
of
the
four
hammocks
in
which
he
and
his
brothers
slept
placed
side
by
side
on
end
this
sufficiently
protected
them
from
the
rain
but
excluded
the
light
so
that
they
had
been
obliged
to
light
a
candle
and
ernest
had
been
reading
to
his
mother
in
a
book
of
voyages
that
had
formed
part
of
the
captain
small
library
it
was
a
singular
coincidence
that
while
we
were
talking
of
the
savages
on
the
way
home
they
were
also
reading
of
them
and
i
found
my
dear
wife
much
agitated
by
the
fears
these
accounts
had
awakened
in
her
mind
after
soothing
her
terrors
i
returned
to
the
fire
to
dry
myself
and
to
enjoy
my
repast
besides
the
birds
francis
had
prepared
fresh
eggs
and
potatoes
for
us
he
told
me
that
his
mamma
had
given
up
her
office
of
cook
to
him
and
assured
me
that
he
would
perform
the
duties
to
our
satisfaction
provided
he
was
furnished
with
materials
fritz
was
to
hunt
jack
to
fish
i
was
to
order
dinner
and
he
would
make
it
ready
and
when
we
have
neither
game
nor
fish
said
jack
we
will
attack
your
this
was
not
at
all
to
the
taste
of
poor
little
francis
who
could
not
bear
his
favourites
to
be
killed
and
who
had
actually
wept
over
the
chicken
that
was
to
make
broth
for
his
mother
we
were
obliged
to
promise
him
that
when
other
resources
failed
we
would
apply
to
our
barrels
of
he
however
gave
us
leave
to
dispose
as
we
liked
of
the
ducks
and
geese
which
were
too
noisy
for
him
after
we
had
concluded
our
repast
we
carried
a
part
of
it
to
our
friends
above
and
proceeded
to
give
them
an
account
of
our
expedition
i
then
secured
the
hammocks
somewhat
more
firmly
to
save
us
from
the
storm
that
was
still
raging
and
the
hour
of
rest
being
at
hand
my
sons
established
themselves
on
mattresses
of
cotton
made
by
their
kind
mother
and
in
spite
of
the
roaring
of
the
winds
we
were
soon
in
profound
repose
chapter
xxxviii
the
storm
continued
to
rage
the
whole
of
the
following
day
and
even
the
day
after
with
the
same
violence
happily
our
tree
stood
firm
though
several
branches
were
broken
amongst
others
that
to
which
wire
was
suspended
i
replaced
it
with
more
care
carried
it
beyond
our
roof
and
fixed
at
the
extremity
the
pointed
instrument
which
had
attracted
the
lightning
i
then
substituted
for
the
hammocks
before
the
window
strong
planks
which
remained
from
my
building
and
which
my
sons
assisted
me
to
raise
with
pulleys
after
having
sawed
them
to
the
proper
length
through
these
i
made
to
admit
the
light
and
air
in
order
to
carry
off
the
rain
i
fixed
a
sort
of
spout
made
of
the
wood
of
a
tree
i
had
met
with
which
was
unknown
to
me
though
apparently
somewhat
like
the
elder
the
whole
of
the
tree
almost
to
the
bark
was
filled
up
with
a
sort
of
pith
easily
removed
from
this
tree
i
made
the
pipes
for
our
fountain
and
the
remainder
was
now
useful
for
these
i
employed
those
days
in
which
i
could
not
go
out
in
separating
the
seeds
and
grain
of
which
i
saw
we
should
have
need
and
in
mending
our
my
sons
in
the
mean
time
nestled
under
the
tree
among
the
roots
were
incessantly
employed
in
the
construction
of
the
carriage
for
their
mother
the
karatas
had
nearly
completed
the
cure
of
ernest
hand
and
he
was
able
to
assist
his
brothers
preparing
the
canes
which
fritz
and
jack
wove
between
the
flat
wooden
wands
with
which
they
had
made
the
frame
of
their
pannier
they
succeeded
in
making
it
so
strong
and
close
that
they
might
have
carried
liquids
in
it
my
dear
wife
foot
and
leg
were
gradually
improving
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
her
confinement
to
reason
with
her
on
her
false
notion
of
the
dangers
of
the
sea
and
to
represent
to
her
the
gloomy
prospect
of
our
sons
if
they
were
left
alone
in
the
island
she
agreed
with
me
but
could
not
resolve
to
leave
it
she
hoped
god
would
send
some
vessel
to
us
which
might
leave
us
some
society
and
after
all
if
our
sons
were
left
she
pointed
out
to
me
that
they
had
our
beautiful
pinnace
and
might
at
any
time
of
their
own
accord
leave
the
island
and
why
should
we
anticipate
the
evils
of
futurity
my
dear
friend
said
she
let
us
think
only
of
the
present
i
am
anxious
now
to
know
if
the
storm
has
spared
my
fine
you
must
wait
a
little
said
i
i
am
as
uneasy
as
you
for
my
my
and
my
at
last
one
night
the
storm
ceased
the
clouds
passed
away
and
the
moon
showed
herself
in
all
her
glory
how
delighted
we
were
my
wife
got
me
to
remove
the
large
planks
i
had
placed
before
the
opening
and
the
bright
moonbeams
streamed
through
the
branches
of
the
tree
into
our
room
a
gentle
breeze
refreshed
us
and
so
delighted
were
we
in
gazing
on
that
sky
of
promise
that
we
could
scarcely
bear
to
go
to
bed
but
spent
half
the
night
in
projects
for
the
morrow
the
good
mother
alone
said
that
she
could
not
join
in
our
excursions
jack
and
francis
smiled
at
each
other
as
they
thought
of
their
litter
which
was
now
nearly
finished
a
bright
sun
awoke
us
early
next
morning
fritz
and
jack
had
requested
me
to
allow
them
to
finish
their
carriage
so
leaving
ernest
with
his
mother
i
took
francis
with
me
to
ascertain
the
damage
done
to
the
garden
at
tent
house
about
which
his
mother
was
so
anxious
we
easily
crossed
the
bridge
but
the
water
had
carried
away
some
of
the
planks
however
my
little
boy
leaped
from
one
plank
to
another
with
great
agility
though
the
distance
was
sometimes
considerable
he
was
so
proud
of
being
my
sole
companion
that
he
scarcely
touched
the
ground
as
he
ran
on
before
me
but
he
had
a
sad
shock
when
he
got
to
the
garden
of
which
we
could
not
find
the
slightest
trace
all
was
destroyed
the
walks
the
fine
the
plantations
of
pines
and
melons
all
had
vanished
francis
stood
like
a
marble
statue
as
pale
and
still
till
bursting
into
tears
he
recovered
himself
oh
my
good
mamma
said
he
what
will
she
say
when
she
hears
of
this
misfortune
but
she
need
not
know
it
papa
added
he
after
a
pause
it
would
distress
her
too
much
and
if
you
and
my
brothers
will
help
me
we
will
repair
the
damage
before
she
can
walk
the
plants
may
not
be
so
large
but
the
earth
is
moist
and
they
will
grow
quickly
and
i
will
work
hard
to
get
it
into
order
i
embraced
my
dear
boy
and
promised
him
this
should
be
our
first
work
i
feared
we
should
have
many
other
disasters
to
repair
but
a
child
of
twelve
years
old
gave
me
an
example
of
resignation
and
courage
we
agreed
to
come
next
day
to
begin
our
labour
for
the
garden
was
too
well
situated
for
me
to
abandon
it
it
was
on
a
gentle
declivity
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
which
sheltered
it
from
the
north
wind
and
was
conveniently
watered
from
the
cascade
i
resolved
to
add
a
sort
of
bank
or
terrace
to
protect
it
from
the
violent
rains
and
francis
was
so
pleased
with
the
idea
that
he
began
to
gather
the
large
stones
which
were
scattered
over
the
garden
and
to
carry
them
to
the
place
where
i
wished
to
build
my
terrace
he
would
have
worked
all
day
if
i
would
have
allowed
him
but
i
wanted
to
look
after
my
young
plantations
my
and
my
fields
and
after
the
destruction
i
had
just
witnessed
i
had
everything
to
fear
i
proceeded
to
the
avenue
of
that
led
to
tent
house
and
was
agreeably
surprised
all
were
to
the
ground
as
well
as
the
bamboos
that
supported
them
but
few
were
torn
up
and
i
saw
that
my
sons
and
i
with
the
labour
of
two
or
three
days
could
restore
them
some
of
them
had
already
begun
to
bear
fruit
but
all
was
destroyed
for
this
year
this
was
however
a
trifling
loss
compared
with
what
i
had
anticipated
for
having
no
more
plants
of
european
fruits
i
could
not
have
replaced
them
besides
having
resolved
to
inhabit
tent
house
at
present
entirely
being
there
defended
from
storms
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
contrive
some
protection
from
the
heat
my
new
plantations
afforded
little
shade
yet
and
i
trembled
to
propose
to
my
wife
to
come
and
inhabit
these
burning
rocks
francis
was
gathering
some
of
the
beautiful
unknown
flowers
of
the
island
for
his
mother
and
when
he
had
formed
his
nosegay
bringing
it
to
me
see
papa
said
he
how
the
rain
has
refreshed
these
flowers
i
wish
it
would
rain
still
it
is
so
dreadfully
hot
here
oh
if
we
had
but
a
little
shade
that
is
just
what
i
was
thinking
of
my
dear
said
i
we
shall
have
shade
enough
when
my
trees
are
grown
but
in
the
mean
time
in
the
mean
time
papa
said
francis
i
will
tell
you
what
you
must
do
you
must
make
a
very
long
broad
colonnade
before
our
house
covered
with
cloth
and
open
before
so
that
mamma
may
have
air
and
shade
at
once
i
was
pleased
with
my
son
idea
and
promised
him
to
construct
a
gallery
soon
and
call
it
the
in
honour
of
him
my
little
boy
was
delighted
that
his
suggestion
should
be
thus
approved
and
begged
me
not
to
tell
his
mamma
as
he
wished
to
surprise
her
as
much
as
his
brothers
did
with
their
carriage
and
he
hoped
the
might
be
finished
before
she
visited
tent
house
i
assured
him
i
would
be
silent
and
we
took
the
road
hence
talking
about
our
new
colonnade
i
projected
making
it
in
the
most
simple
and
easy
way
a
row
of
strong
planted
at
equal
distances
along
the
front
of
our
house
and
united
by
a
plank
of
wood
at
the
top
cut
into
arches
between
the
canes
others
i
would
place
sloping
from
the
rock
to
which
i
would
fasten
them
by
iron
cramps
these
were
to
be
covered
with
sailcloth
prepared
with
the
elastic
gum
and
well
secured
to
the
plank
this
building
would
not
take
much
time
and
i
anticipated
the
pleasure
of
my
wife
when
she
found
out
that
it
was
an
invention
of
her
little
favourite
who
of
a
mild
and
reflecting
disposition
was
beloved
by
us
all
as
we
walked
along
we
saw
something
approaching
that
francis
soon
discovered
to
be
his
brothers
with
their
new
carriage
and
concluding
that
his
mamma
occupied
it
he
hastened
to
meet
them
lest
they
should
proceed
to
the
garden
but
on
our
approach
we
discovered
that
ernest
was
in
the
litter
which
was
borne
by
the
cow
before
on
which
fritz
was
mounted
and
by
the
ass
behind
with
jack
on
it
ernest
declared
the
conveyance
was
so
easy
and
delightful
that
he
should
often
take
his
mother
place
i
like
that
very
much
said
jack
then
i
will
take
care
that
we
will
harness
the
onagra
and
the
buffalo
for
you
and
they
will
give
you
a
pretty
jolting
i
promise
you
the
cow
and
ass
are
only
for
mamma
look
papa
is
it
not
complete
we
wished
to
try
it
as
soon
as
we
finished
it
so
we
got
ernest
to
occupy
it
while
mother
was
asleep
ernest
declared
it
only
wanted
two
cushions
one
to
sit
upon
the
other
to
recline
against
to
make
it
perfect
and
though
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
love
of
ease
i
encouraged
the
notion
in
order
to
delay
my
wife
excursion
till
our
plans
were
completed
i
then
put
francis
into
the
carriage
beside
his
brother
and
ordering
fritz
and
jack
to
proceed
with
their
equipage
to
inspect
our
i
returned
to
my
wife
who
was
still
sleeping
on
her
awaking
i
told
her
the
garden
and
plantations
would
require
a
few
days
labour
to
set
them
in
order
and
i
should
leave
ernest
who
was
not
yet
in
condition
to
be
a
labourer
to
nurse
her
and
read
to
her
my
sons
returned
in
the
evening
and
gave
me
a
melancholy
account
of
our
the
corn
was
completely
destroyed
and
we
regretted
this
the
more
as
we
had
very
little
left
for
seed
we
had
anticipated
a
feast
of
but
we
were
obliged
to
give
up
all
hope
for
this
year
and
to
content
ourselves
with
our
cakes
of
cassava
and
with
potatoes
the
maize
had
suffered
less
and
might
have
been
a
resource
for
us
but
the
large
hard
grain
was
so
very
difficult
to
reduce
to
flour
fine
enough
for
dough
fritz
often
recurred
to
the
necessity
of
building
a
mill
near
the
cascade
at
tent
house
but
this
was
not
the
work
of
a
moment
and
we
had
time
to
consider
of
it
for
at
present
we
had
no
corn
to
grind
as
i
found
francis
had
let
his
brothers
into
all
our
secrets
it
was
agreed
that
i
with
fritz
jack
and
francis
should
proceed
to
tent
house
next
morning
francis
desired
to
be
of
the
party
that
he
might
direct
the
laying
out
of
the
garden
he
said
with
an
important
air
as
he
had
been
his
mother
assistant
on
its
formation
we
arranged
our
bag
of
and
having
bathed
my
wife
foot
with
a
simple
embrocation
we
offered
our
united
prayers
and
retired
to
our
beds
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
toils
of
the
next
day
chapter
xxxix
we
rose
early
and
after
our
usual
morning
duties
we
left
our
invalids
for
the
whole
day
taking
with
us
for
our
dinner
a
goose
and
some
potatoes
made
ready
the
evening
before
we
harnessed
the
bull
and
the
buffalo
to
the
cart
and
i
sent
fritz
and
jack
to
the
wood
of
bamboos
with
orders
to
load
the
cart
with
as
many
as
it
would
contain
and
especially
to
select
some
very
thick
ones
for
my
colonnade
the
rest
i
intended
for
props
for
my
young
trees
and
this
i
proposed
to
be
my
first
undertaking
francis
would
have
preferred
beginning
with
the
or
the
garden
but
he
was
finally
won
over
by
the
thoughts
of
the
delicious
fruits
which
we
might
lose
by
our
neglect
the
peaches
plums
pears
and
above
all
the
cherries
of
which
he
was
very
fond
he
then
consented
to
assist
me
in
holding
the
trees
whilst
i
replaced
the
roots
after
which
he
went
to
cut
the
reeds
to
tie
them
suddenly
i
heard
him
cry
papa
papa
here
is
a
large
chest
come
for
us
come
and
take
it
i
ran
to
him
and
saw
it
was
the
very
chest
we
had
seen
floating
and
which
we
had
taken
for
the
boat
at
a
distance
the
waves
had
left
it
in
our
bay
entangled
in
the
reeds
which
grew
abundantly
here
it
was
almost
buried
in
the
sand
we
could
not
remove
it
alone
and
notwithstanding
our
curiosity
we
were
compelled
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
my
sons
we
returned
to
our
work
and
it
was
pretty
well
advanced
when
the
tired
and
hungry
party
returned
with
their
of
bamboos
we
rested
and
sat
down
to
eat
our
goose
guavas
and
sweet
acorns
which
had
escaped
the
storm
and
which
my
sons
brought
completed
our
repast
fritz
had
killed
a
large
bird
in
the
marsh
which
i
took
at
first
for
a
young
flamingo
but
it
was
a
young
cassowary
the
first
i
had
seen
in
the
island
this
bird
is
remarkable
for
its
extraordinary
size
and
for
its
plumage
so
short
and
fine
that
it
seems
rather
to
be
hair
than
feathers
i
should
have
liked
to
have
had
it
alive
to
ornament
our
and
it
was
so
young
we
might
have
tamed
it
but
fritz
unerring
aim
had
killed
it
at
once
i
wished
to
let
my
wife
see
this
rare
bird
which
if
standing
on
its
webbed
feet
would
have
been
four
feet
high
i
therefore
forbade
them
to
meddle
with
it
illustration
fritz
with
a
strong
hatchet
forced
the
chest
open
and
we
all
eagerly
crowded
to
see
the
contents
as
we
ate
we
talked
of
the
chest
and
our
curiosity
being
stronger
than
our
hunger
we
swallowed
our
repast
hastily
and
then
ran
down
to
the
shore
we
were
obliged
to
plunge
into
the
water
up
to
the
waist
and
then
had
some
difficulty
to
extricate
it
from
the
weed
and
slime
and
to
push
it
on
shore
no
sooner
had
we
placed
it
in
safety
than
fritz
with
a
strong
hatchet
forced
it
open
and
we
all
eagerly
crowded
to
see
the
contents
fritz
hoped
it
would
be
powder
and
jack
who
was
somewhat
fond
of
dress
and
had
notions
of
elegance
declared
in
favour
of
clothes
and
particularly
of
linen
finer
and
whiter
than
that
which
his
mother
wove
if
ernest
had
been
there
books
would
have
been
his
desire
for
my
own
part
there
was
nothing
i
was
more
anxious
for
than
european
seeds
particularly
corn
francis
had
a
lingering
wish
that
the
chest
might
contain
some
of
those
gingerbread
cakes
which
his
grandmamma
used
to
treat
him
with
in
europe
and
which
he
had
often
regretted
but
he
kept
this
wish
to
himself
for
fear
his
brothers
should
call
him
little
glutton
and
assured
us
that
he
should
like
a
little
with
a
small
saw
better
than
anything
in
the
world
and
he
was
the
only
one
who
had
his
wish
the
chest
was
opened
and
we
saw
that
it
was
filled
with
a
number
of
trifling
things
likely
to
tempt
savage
nations
and
to
become
the
means
of
exchange
principally
glass
and
iron
ware
coloured
beads
pins
needles
children
toys
constructed
as
models
such
as
carts
and
tools
of
every
sort
amongst
which
we
found
some
likely
to
be
useful
such
as
hatchets
saws
planes
gimlets
besides
a
collection
of
knives
of
which
francis
had
the
choice
and
scissors
which
were
reserved
for
mamma
her
own
being
nearly
worn
out
i
had
moreover
the
pleasure
of
finding
a
quantity
of
nails
of
every
size
and
kind
besides
iron
hooks
staples
c
which
i
needed
greatly
after
we
had
examined
the
contents
and
selected
what
we
wanted
immediately
we
closed
up
the
chest
and
conveyed
it
to
our
magazine
at
tent
house
we
had
spent
so
much
time
in
our
examination
that
we
had
some
difficulty
to
finish
propping
our
trees
and
to
arrive
at
home
before
it
was
dark
we
found
my
wife
somewhat
uneasy
at
our
lengthened
absence
but
our
appearance
soon
calmed
her
mother
said
i
i
have
brought
back
all
your
chickens
to
crowd
under
your
wing
and
we
have
not
come
back
said
jack
look
mamma
here
are
a
beautiful
pair
of
scissors
a
large
paper
of
needles
another
of
pins
and
a
thimble
how
rich
you
are
now
and
when
you
get
well
you
can
make
me
a
pretty
waistcoat
and
a
pair
of
trousers
for
i
am
in
great
want
of
them
and
i
mamma
said
francis
have
brought
you
a
mirror
that
you
may
arrange
your
cap
you
have
often
been
sorry
papa
did
not
remember
to
bring
one
from
the
ship
this
was
intended
for
the
savages
and
i
will
begin
with
you
i
believe
i
rather
resemble
one
now
said
my
good
elizabeth
arranging
the
red
and
yellow
silk
handkerchief
which
she
usually
wore
on
her
head
only
mamma
said
jack
when
you
wear
the
comical
pointed
bonnet
which
ernest
made
you
what
matters
it
said
she
whether
it
be
pointed
or
round
it
will
protect
me
from
the
sun
and
it
is
the
work
of
my
ernest
to
whom
i
am
much
obliged
ernest
with
great
ingenuity
and
patience
had
endeavoured
to
plait
his
mother
a
bonnet
of
the
he
had
succeeded
but
not
knowing
how
to
form
the
round
crown
he
was
obliged
to
finish
it
in
a
point
to
the
great
and
incessant
diversion
of
his
brothers
mother
said
ernest
in
his
usual
grave
and
thoughtful
tone
i
should
not
like
you
to
look
like
a
savage
therefore
as
soon
as
i
regain
the
use
of
my
hand
my
first
work
shall
be
to
make
you
a
bonnet
which
i
will
take
care
shall
be
formed
with
a
round
crown
as
you
will
lend
me
one
of
your
large
needles
and
i
will
take
to
sew
the
crown
on
the
head
of
either
jack
or
francis
what
do
you
mean
my
head
said
they
both
together
oh
i
do
mean
to
take
it
off
your
shoulders
said
he
it
will
only
be
necessary
that
one
of
you
should
kneel
down
before
me
for
a
day
perhaps
while
i
use
your
head
as
a
model
and
you
need
not
cry
out
much
if
i
should
chance
to
push
my
needle
in
this
time
the
philosopher
had
the
laugh
on
his
side
and
his
tormentors
were
silenced
we
now
explained
to
my
wife
where
we
had
found
the
presents
we
had
brought
her
my
offerings
to
her
were
a
light
axe
which
she
could
use
to
cut
her
with
and
an
iron
kettle
smaller
and
more
convenient
than
the
one
she
had
fritz
had
retired
and
now
came
in
dragging
with
difficulty
his
huge
cassowary
here
mamma
said
he
i
have
brought
you
a
little
chicken
for
your
dinner
and
the
astonishment
and
laughter
again
commenced
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
plucking
the
bird
to
prepare
part
of
it
for
next
day
we
then
retired
to
rest
that
we
might
begin
our
labour
early
next
morning
ernest
chose
to
remain
with
his
books
and
his
mother
for
whom
he
formed
with
the
mattresses
a
sort
of
reclining
chair
in
which
she
was
able
to
sit
up
in
bed
and
sew
thus
she
endured
a
confinement
of
six
weeks
without
complaint
and
in
that
time
got
all
our
clothes
put
into
good
order
francis
had
nearly
betrayed
our
secret
once
by
asking
his
mamma
to
make
him
a
mason
apron
a
mason
apron
said
she
are
you
going
to
build
a
house
child
i
meant
to
say
a
gardener
apron
said
he
his
mamma
was
satisfied
and
promised
to
comply
with
his
request
in
the
mean
time
my
three
sons
and
i
laboured
assiduously
to
get
the
garden
into
order
again
and
to
raise
the
terraces
which
we
hoped
might
be
a
defence
against
future
storms
fritz
had
also
proposed
to
me
to
construct
a
stone
conduit
to
bring
the
water
to
our
from
the
river
to
which
we
might
carry
it
back
after
it
had
passed
round
our
this
was
a
formidable
task
but
too
useful
an
affair
to
be
neglected
and
aided
by
the
geometrical
skill
of
fritz
and
the
ready
hands
of
my
two
younger
boys
the
conduit
was
completed
i
took
an
opportunity
at
the
same
time
to
dig
a
pond
above
the
garden
into
which
the
conduit
poured
the
water
this
was
always
warm
with
the
sun
and
by
means
of
a
sluice
we
were
able
to
disperse
it
in
little
channels
to
water
the
garden
the
pond
would
also
be
useful
to
preserve
small
fish
and
crabs
for
use
we
next
proceeded
to
our
embankment
this
was
intended
to
protect
the
garden
from
any
extraordinary
overflow
of
the
river
and
from
the
water
running
from
the
rocks
after
heavy
rains
we
then
laid
out
our
garden
on
the
same
plan
as
before
except
that
i
made
the
walks
wider
and
not
so
flat
i
carried
one
directly
to
our
house
which
in
the
autumn
i
intended
to
plant
with
shrubs
that
my
wife
might
have
a
shady
avenue
to
approach
her
garden
where
i
also
planned
an
arbour
furnished
with
seats
as
a
for
her
the
rocks
were
covered
with
numerous
climbing
plants
bearing
every
variety
of
elegant
flower
and
i
had
only
to
make
my
selection
all
this
work
with
the
enclosing
the
garden
with
palisades
of
bamboo
occupied
us
about
a
fortnight
in
which
time
our
invalids
made
great
progress
towards
their
recovery
after
the
whole
was
finished
francis
entreated
me
to
begin
his
gallery
my
boys
approved
of
my
plan
and
fritz
declared
that
the
house
was
certainly
comfortable
and
commodious
but
that
it
would
be
wonderfully
improved
by
a
colonnade
with
a
little
pavilion
at
each
end
and
a
fountain
in
each
pavilion
i
never
heard
a
word
of
these
pavilions
said
i
no
said
jack
they
are
our
own
invention
the
colonnade
will
be
called
the
and
we
wish
our
little
pavilions
to
be
named
the
one
the
other
if
you
please
i
agreed
to
this
reasonable
request
and
only
begged
to
know
how
they
would
procure
water
for
their
fountains
fritz
undertook
to
bring
the
water
if
i
would
only
assist
them
in
completing
this
little
scheme
to
give
pleasure
to
their
beloved
mother
i
was
charmed
to
see
the
zeal
and
anxiety
of
my
children
to
oblige
their
tender
mother
her
illness
seemed
to
have
strengthened
their
attachment
they
thought
only
how
to
console
and
amuse
her
she
sometimes
told
me
she
really
blessed
the
accident
which
had
taught
her
how
much
she
was
valued
by
all
around
her
chapter
xl
the
next
day
was
sunday
our
happy
sabbath
for
repose
and
quiet
conversation
at
home
after
passing
the
day
in
our
usual
devotions
and
sober
reading
my
three
elder
boys
requested
my
permission
to
walk
towards
our
farm
in
the
evening
on
their
return
they
informed
me
it
would
be
necessary
to
give
a
few
days
labour
to
our
plantations
of
maize
and
potatoes
i
therefore
determined
to
look
to
them
though
i
was
out
early
next
morning
i
found
fritz
and
jack
had
been
gone
some
time
leaving
only
the
ass
in
the
stables
which
i
secured
for
my
little
francis
i
perceived
also
that
they
had
dismounted
my
cart
and
carried
away
the
wheels
from
which
i
concluded
that
they
had
met
with
some
tree
in
their
walk
the
preceding
evening
suitable
for
the
pipes
for
their
fountains
and
that
they
had
now
returned
to
cut
it
down
and
convey
it
to
tent
house
as
i
did
not
know
where
to
meet
with
them
i
proceeded
with
francis
on
the
ass
to
commence
his
favourite
work
i
drew
my
plan
on
the
ground
first
at
the
distance
of
twelve
feet
from
the
rock
which
formed
the
front
of
our
house
i
marked
a
straight
line
of
fifty
feet
which
i
divided
into
ten
spaces
of
five
feet
each
for
my
colonnade
the
two
ends
were
to
be
reserved
for
the
two
pavilions
my
sons
wished
to
build
i
was
busy
in
my
calculations
and
francis
placing
stakes
in
the
places
where
i
wished
to
dig
when
the
cart
drove
up
with
our
two
good
labourers
they
had
as
i
expected
found
the
evening
before
a
species
of
pine
well
adapted
for
their
pipes
they
had
cut
down
four
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
in
length
which
they
had
brought
on
the
wheels
of
the
cart
drawn
by
the
four
animals
they
had
had
some
difficulty
in
transporting
them
to
the
place
and
the
greatest
still
remained
the
boring
the
trunks
and
then
uniting
them
firmly
i
had
neither
augers
nor
any
tools
fit
for
the
purpose
i
had
certainly
constructed
a
little
fountain
at
falcon
nest
but
the
stream
was
near
at
hand
and
was
easily
conveyed
by
cane
pipes
to
our
basin
here
the
distance
was
considerable
the
ground
unequal
and
to
have
the
water
pure
and
cool
underground
pipes
were
necessary
i
thought
of
large
bamboos
but
fritz
pointed
out
the
knots
and
the
difficulty
of
joining
the
pieces
and
begged
me
to
leave
it
to
him
as
he
had
seen
fountains
made
in
switzerland
and
had
no
fears
of
success
in
the
mean
time
all
hands
set
to
work
at
the
arcade
we
selected
twelve
bamboos
of
equal
height
and
thickness
and
fixed
them
securely
in
the
earth
at
five
feet
from
each
other
these
formed
a
pretty
colonnade
and
were
work
enough
for
one
day
we
took
care
to
divert
all
inquiries
at
night
by
discussing
the
subjects
which
our
invalids
had
been
reading
during
the
day
the
little
library
of
our
captain
was
very
choice
besides
the
voyages
and
travels
which
interested
them
greatly
there
was
a
good
collection
of
historians
and
some
of
the
best
poets
for
which
ernest
had
no
little
taste
however
he
requested
earnestly
that
he
might
be
of
our
party
next
day
and
francis
offered
to
stay
with
mamma
expecting
no
doubt
ernest
congratulations
on
the
forward
state
of
the
franciade
the
next
morning
ernest
and
i
set
out
his
brothers
having
preceded
us
poor
ernest
regretted
as
we
went
that
he
had
no
share
in
these
happy
schemes
for
his
mother
i
reminded
him
however
of
his
dutiful
care
of
her
during
her
sickness
and
all
his
endeavours
to
amuse
her
and
besides
added
i
did
you
not
make
her
a
straw
bonnet
yes
said
he
and
i
now
remember
what
a
frightful
shape
it
was
i
will
try
to
make
a
better
and
will
go
morning
to
choose
my
straw
as
we
approached
tent
house
we
heard
a
most
singular
noise
echoing
at
intervals
amongst
the
rocks
we
soon
discovered
the
cause
in
a
hollow
of
the
rocks
i
saw
a
very
hot
fire
which
jack
was
blowing
through
a
cane
whilst
fritz
was
turning
amidst
the
embers
a
bar
of
iron
when
it
was
red
hot
they
laid
it
on
an
anvil
i
had
brought
from
the
ship
and
struck
it
alternately
with
hammers
to
bring
it
to
a
point
well
done
my
young
smiths
said
i
we
ought
to
try
all
things
and
keep
what
is
good
do
you
expect
to
succeed
in
making
your
auger
i
suppose
that
is
what
you
want
yes
father
said
fritz
we
should
succeed
well
enough
if
we
only
had
a
good
pair
of
bellows
you
see
we
have
already
got
a
tolerable
point
now
fritz
could
not
believe
anything
was
impossible
he
had
killed
a
kangaroo
the
evening
before
and
skinned
it
the
flesh
made
us
a
dinner
of
the
skin
he
determined
to
make
a
pair
of
bellows
he
nailed
it
with
the
hair
out
not
having
time
to
tan
it
to
two
flat
pieces
of
wood
with
holes
in
them
to
this
he
added
a
reed
for
the
pipe
he
then
fixed
it
by
means
of
a
long
cord
and
a
post
to
the
side
of
his
fire
and
jack
with
his
hand
or
his
foot
blew
the
fire
so
that
the
iron
was
speedily
red
hot
and
quite
malleable
i
then
showed
them
how
to
twist
the
iron
into
a
screw
rather
clumsy
but
which
would
answer
the
purpose
tolerably
well
at
one
end
they
formed
a
ring
in
which
we
placed
a
piece
of
wood
transversely
to
enable
them
to
turn
the
screw
we
then
made
a
trial
of
it
we
placed
a
tree
on
two
props
and
fritz
and
i
managed
the
auger
so
well
that
we
had
our
tree
pierced
through
in
a
very
little
time
working
first
at
one
end
and
then
at
the
other
jack
in
the
mean
time
collected
the
shavings
we
made
which
he
deposited
in
the
kitchen
for
his
mother
use
to
kindle
the
fire
ernest
meanwhile
was
walking
about
making
observations
and
giving
his
advice
to
his
brothers
on
the
architecture
of
their
pavilions
till
seeing
they
were
going
to
bore
another
tree
he
retired
into
the
garden
to
see
the
embankment
he
returned
delighted
with
the
improvements
and
much
disposed
to
take
some
employment
he
wanted
to
assist
in
boring
the
tree
but
we
could
not
all
work
at
it
i
undertook
this
labour
myself
and
sent
him
to
blow
the
bellows
while
his
brothers
laboured
at
the
forge
the
work
not
being
too
hard
for
his
lame
hand
my
young
smiths
were
engaged
in
flattening
the
iron
to
make
joints
to
unite
their
pipes
they
succeeded
very
well
and
then
began
to
dig
the
ground
to
lay
them
ernest
knowing
something
of
geometry
and
was
able
to
give
them
some
useful
hints
which
enabled
them
to
complete
their
work
successfully
leaving
them
to
do
this
i
employed
myself
in
covering
in
my
long
colonnade
after
i
had
placed
on
my
columns
a
plank
cut
in
arches
which
united
them
and
was
firmly
nailed
to
them
i
extended
from
it
bamboos
placed
sloping
against
the
rock
and
secured
to
it
by
cramps
of
iron
the
work
of
my
young
smiths
when
my
bamboo
roof
was
solidly
fixed
the
canes
as
close
as
possible
i
filled
the
interstices
with
a
clay
i
found
near
the
river
and
poured
gum
over
it
i
had
thus
an
impervious
and
brilliant
roof
which
appeared
to
be
varnished
and
striped
green
and
brown
i
then
raised
the
floor
a
foot
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
damp
and
paved
it
with
the
square
stones
i
had
preserved
when
we
cut
the
rock
it
must
be
understood
that
all
this
was
the
work
of
many
days
i
was
assisted
by
jack
and
fritz
and
by
ernest
and
francis
alternately
one
always
remaining
with
his
mother
who
was
still
unable
to
walk
ernest
employed
his
time
when
at
home
in
making
the
straw
bonnet
without
either
borrowing
his
brother
head
for
a
model
or
letting
any
of
them
know
what
he
was
doing
nevertheless
he
assisted
his
brothers
with
their
pavilions
by
his
really
valuable
knowledge
they
formed
them
very
elegantly
something
like
a
chinese
pagoda
they
were
exactly
square
supported
on
four
columns
and
rather
higher
than
the
gallery
the
roofs
terminated
in
a
point
and
resembled
large
the
fountains
were
in
the
middle
the
basins
were
formed
of
the
shells
of
two
turtles
from
our
reservoir
which
were
mercilessly
sacrificed
for
the
purpose
and
furnished
our
table
abundantly
for
some
days
they
succeeded
the
cassowary
which
had
supplied
us
very
seasonably
its
flesh
tasted
like
beef
and
made
excellent
soup
but
to
return
to
the
fountains
ernest
suggested
the
idea
of
ornamenting
the
end
of
the
perpendicular
pipe
which
brought
the
water
to
the
basin
with
shells
every
sort
might
be
collected
on
the
shore
of
the
most
brilliant
colours
and
curious
and
varied
shapes
he
was
passionately
devoted
to
natural
history
and
had
made
a
collection
of
these
endeavouring
to
classify
them
from
the
descriptions
he
met
with
in
the
books
of
voyages
and
travels
some
of
these
of
the
most
dazzling
beauty
were
placed
round
the
pipe
which
had
been
plastered
with
clay
from
thence
the
water
was
received
into
a
shaped
like
an
antique
urn
and
again
was
poured
gracefully
into
the
large
a
small
channel
conveyed
it
then
out
of
the
pavilions
the
whole
was
completed
in
less
time
than
i
could
have
imagined
and
greatly
surpassed
my
expectations
conferring
an
inestimable
advantage
on
our
dwelling
by
securing
us
from
the
heat
all
honour
was
rendered
to
master
francis
the
inventor
and
was
written
in
large
letters
on
the
middle
arch
and
were
written
in
the
same
way
over
the
pavilions
ernest
alone
was
not
named
and
he
seemed
somewhat
affected
by
it
he
had
acquired
a
great
taste
for
rambling
and
botanizing
and
had
communicated
it
also
to
fritz
and
now
that
our
labours
were
ended
at
tent
house
they
left
us
to
nurse
our
invalid
and
made
long
excursions
together
which
lasted
sometimes
whole
days
as
they
generally
returned
with
some
game
or
some
new
fruit
we
pardoned
their
absence
and
they
were
always
welcome
sometimes
they
brought
a
kangaroo
sometimes
an
agouti
the
flesh
of
which
resembles
that
of
a
rabbit
but
is
richer
sometimes
they
brought
wild
ducks
pigeons
and
even
partridges
these
were
contributed
by
fritz
who
never
went
out
without
his
gun
and
his
dogs
ernest
brought
us
natural
curiosities
which
amused
us
much
stones
crystals
petrifactions
insects
butterflies
of
rare
beauty
and
flowers
whose
colours
and
fragrance
no
one
in
europe
can
form
an
idea
of
sometimes
he
brought
fruit
which
we
always
administered
first
to
our
monkey
as
taster
some
of
them
proved
very
delicious
two
of
his
discoveries
especially
were
most
valuable
acquisitions
the
guajaraba
on
the
large
leaf
of
which
one
may
write
with
a
pointed
instrument
and
the
fruit
of
which
a
sort
of
grape
is
very
good
to
eat
also
the
every
part
of
which
is
so
useful
that
we
were
truly
thankful
to
heaven
and
our
dear
boys
for
the
discovery
whilst
young
the
trunk
contains
a
sort
of
very
delicious
the
is
crowned
by
a
head
formed
of
from
forty
to
eighty
leafy
branches
which
spread
round
the
top
the
dates
are
particularly
good
about
and
my
wife
immediately
began
to
preserve
them
my
sons
could
only
bring
the
fruit
now
but
we
purposed
to
transplant
some
of
the
trees
themselves
near
our
abode
we
did
not
discourage
our
sons
in
these
profitable
expeditions
but
they
had
another
aim
which
i
was
yet
ignorant
of
in
the
mean
time
i
usually
walked
with
one
of
my
younger
sons
towards
tent
house
to
attend
to
our
garden
and
to
see
if
our
works
continued
in
good
condition
to
receive
mamma
who
daily
improved
but
i
insisted
on
her
being
completely
restored
before
she
was
introduced
to
them
our
dwelling
looked
beautiful
amongst
the
picturesque
rocks
surrounded
by
trees
of
every
sort
and
facing
the
smooth
and
lovely
bay
of
safety
the
garden
was
not
so
forward
as
i
could
have
wished
but
we
were
obliged
to
be
patient
and
hope
for
the
best
chapter
xli
one
day
having
gone
over
with
my
younger
sons
to
weed
the
garden
and
survey
our
possessions
i
perceived
that
the
roof
of
the
gallery
wanted
a
little
repair
and
called
jack
to
raise
for
me
the
rope
ladder
which
i
had
brought
from
falcon
nest
and
which
had
been
very
useful
while
we
were
constructing
the
roof
but
we
sought
for
it
everywhere
it
could
not
be
found
and
as
we
were
quite
free
from
in
our
island
i
could
only
accuse
my
elder
sons
who
had
doubtless
carried
it
off
to
ascend
some
tall
tree
obliged
to
be
content
we
walked
into
the
garden
by
the
foot
of
the
rocks
since
our
arrival
i
had
been
somewhat
uneasy
at
hearing
a
dull
continued
noise
which
appeared
to
proceed
from
this
side
the
forge
we
had
passed
now
extinguished
and
our
workmen
were
absent
passing
along
close
to
the
rocks
the
noise
became
more
distinct
and
i
was
truly
alarmed
could
it
be
an
earthquake
or
perhaps
it
announced
some
volcanic
explosion
i
stopped
before
that
part
of
the
rock
where
the
noise
was
loudest
the
surface
was
firm
and
level
but
from
time
to
time
blows
and
falling
stones
seemed
to
strike
our
ears
i
was
uncertain
what
to
do
curiosity
prompted
me
to
stay
but
a
sort
of
terror
urged
me
to
remove
my
child
and
myself
however
jack
always
daring
was
unwilling
to
go
till
he
had
discovered
the
cause
of
the
phenomenon
if
francis
were
here
said
he
he
would
fancy
it
was
the
wicked
gnomes
working
underground
and
he
would
be
in
a
fine
fright
for
my
part
i
believe
it
is
only
people
come
to
collect
the
salt
in
the
rock
people
said
i
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
jack
i
could
excuse
francis
and
his
it
would
be
at
least
a
poetic
fancy
but
yours
is
quite
absurd
where
are
the
people
to
come
from
but
what
else
can
it
be
said
he
hark
you
may
hear
them
strike
the
rock
be
certain
however
said
i
there
are
no
people
at
that
moment
i
distinctly
heard
human
voices
speaking
laughing
and
apparently
clapping
their
hands
i
could
not
distinguish
any
words
i
was
struck
with
a
mortal
terror
but
jack
whom
nothing
could
alarm
clapped
his
hands
also
with
joy
that
he
had
guessed
right
what
did
i
say
papa
was
i
not
right
are
there
not
people
within
the
rock
friends
i
hope
he
was
approaching
the
rock
when
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
shaking
a
stone
soon
fell
down
then
another
i
seized
hold
of
jack
to
drag
him
away
lest
he
should
be
crushed
by
the
fragments
of
rock
at
that
moment
another
stone
fell
and
we
saw
two
heads
appear
through
the
opening
the
heads
of
fritz
and
ernest
judge
of
our
surprise
and
joy
jack
was
soon
through
the
opening
and
assisting
his
brothers
to
enlarge
it
as
soon
as
i
could
enter
i
stepped
in
and
found
myself
in
a
real
grotto
of
a
round
form
with
a
vaulted
roof
divided
by
a
narrow
crevice
which
admitted
the
light
and
air
it
was
however
better
lighted
by
two
large
gourd
lamps
i
saw
my
long
ladder
of
ropes
suspended
from
the
opening
at
the
top
and
thus
comprehended
how
my
sons
had
penetrated
into
this
recess
which
it
was
impossible
to
suspect
the
existence
of
from
the
outside
but
how
had
they
discovered
it
and
what
were
they
making
of
it
these
were
my
two
questions
ernest
replied
at
once
to
the
last
i
wished
said
he
to
make
a
for
my
mother
when
she
came
to
her
garden
my
brothers
have
each
built
some
place
for
her
and
called
it
by
their
name
i
had
a
desire
that
some
place
in
our
island
might
be
dedicated
to
ernest
and
i
now
present
you
the
and
after
all
said
jack
it
will
make
a
pretty
dwelling
for
the
first
of
us
that
marries
silence
little
said
i
where
do
you
expect
to
find
a
wife
in
this
island
do
you
think
you
shall
discover
one
among
the
rocks
as
your
brothers
have
discovered
the
grotto
but
tell
me
fritz
what
directed
you
here
our
good
star
father
said
he
ernest
and
i
were
walking
round
these
rocks
and
talking
of
his
wish
for
a
for
my
mother
on
her
way
to
the
garden
he
projected
a
tent
but
the
path
was
too
narrow
to
admit
it
and
the
rock
heated
by
the
sun
was
like
a
stove
we
were
considering
what
we
should
do
when
i
saw
on
the
summit
of
the
rock
a
very
beautiful
little
unknown
quadruped
from
its
form
i
should
have
taken
it
for
a
young
chamois
if
i
had
been
in
switzerland
but
ernest
reminded
me
that
the
chamois
was
peculiar
to
cold
countries
and
he
thought
it
was
a
gazelle
or
antelope
probably
the
gazelle
of
guinea
or
java
called
by
naturalists
the
chevrotain
you
may
suppose
i
tried
to
climb
the
rock
on
which
this
little
animal
remained
standing
with
one
foot
raised
and
its
pretty
head
turning
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
but
it
was
useless
to
attempt
it
here
where
the
rock
was
smooth
and
perpendicular
besides
i
should
have
put
the
gazelle
to
flight
as
it
is
a
timid
and
wild
animal
i
then
remembered
there
was
a
place
near
tent
house
where
a
considerable
break
occurred
in
the
chain
of
rocks
and
we
found
that
with
a
little
difficulty
the
rock
might
be
scaled
by
ascending
this
ravine
ernest
laughed
at
me
and
asked
me
if
i
expected
the
antelope
would
wait
patiently
till
i
got
to
it
no
matter
i
determined
to
try
and
i
told
him
to
remain
but
he
soon
determined
to
accompany
me
for
he
fancied
that
in
the
fissure
of
a
rock
he
saw
a
flower
of
a
beautiful
which
was
unknown
to
him
my
learned
botanist
thought
it
must
be
an
or
heath
and
wished
to
ascertain
the
fact
one
helping
the
other
we
soon
got
through
all
difficulties
and
arrived
at
the
summit
and
here
we
were
amply
repaid
by
the
beautiful
prospect
on
every
side
we
will
talk
of
that
afterwards
father
i
have
formed
some
idea
of
the
country
which
these
rocks
separate
us
from
but
to
return
to
our
grotto
i
went
along
first
looking
for
my
pretty
gazelle
which
i
saw
licking
a
piece
of
rock
where
doubtless
she
found
some
salt
i
was
hardly
a
hundred
yards
from
her
my
gun
ready
when
i
was
suddenly
stopped
by
a
crevice
which
i
could
not
cross
though
the
opening
was
not
very
wide
the
pretty
quadruped
was
on
the
rock
opposite
to
me
but
of
what
use
would
it
have
been
to
shoot
it
when
i
could
not
secure
it
i
was
obliged
to
defer
it
till
a
better
opportunity
offered
and
turned
to
examine
the
opening
which
appeared
deep
still
i
could
see
that
the
bottom
of
the
cavity
was
white
like
that
of
our
former
grotto
i
called
ernest
who
was
behind
me
with
his
plants
and
stones
to
impart
to
him
an
idea
that
suddenly
struck
me
it
was
to
make
this
the
retreat
for
my
mother
i
told
him
that
i
believed
the
floor
of
the
cave
was
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
path
that
led
to
the
garden
and
we
had
only
to
make
an
opening
in
the
form
of
a
natural
grotto
and
it
would
be
exactly
what
he
wished
ernest
was
much
pleased
with
the
idea
and
said
he
could
easily
ascertain
the
level
by
means
of
a
weight
attached
to
a
string
but
though
he
was
startled
at
the
difficulty
of
descending
to
our
labour
every
day
and
returning
in
the
evening
he
would
not
agree
to
my
wish
of
beginning
at
the
outside
of
the
rock
as
we
had
done
in
our
former
grotto
he
had
several
reasons
for
wishing
to
work
from
within
the
first
place
said
he
will
be
so
much
cooler
this
summer
weather
we
should
be
soon
unable
to
go
on
labouring
before
the
burning
rock
then
our
path
is
so
narrow
that
we
should
not
know
how
to
dispose
of
the
rubbish
in
the
interior
it
will
serve
us
to
make
a
bench
round
the
grotto
besides
i
should
have
such
pleasure
in
completing
it
secretly
and
unsuspected
without
any
assistance
or
advice
except
yours
my
dear
fritz
which
i
accept
with
all
my
heart
so
pray
find
out
some
means
of
descending
and
ascending
readily
i
immediately
recollected
your
rope
ladder
father
it
was
forty
feet
long
and
we
could
easily
fasten
it
to
the
point
of
the
rock
ernest
was
delighted
and
sanguine
we
returned
with
all
speed
we
took
first
a
roll
of
cord
and
some
candles
then
the
rope
ladder
which
we
rolled
up
as
well
as
we
could
but
had
great
difficulty
in
conveying
it
up
the
rock
once
or
twice
when
the
ascent
was
very
difficult
we
were
obliged
to
fasten
a
cord
to
it
and
draw
it
up
after
us
but
determination
courage
and
perseverance
overcame
all
obstacles
we
arrived
at
the
opening
and
on
sounding
it
we
were
glad
to
find
our
ladder
would
be
long
enough
to
reach
the
bottom
we
then
measured
the
outside
of
the
rock
and
ascertained
that
the
floor
of
the
grotto
was
near
the
same
level
as
the
ground
outside
we
remembered
your
lessons
father
and
made
some
experiments
to
discover
if
it
contained
mephitic
air
we
first
lighted
some
candles
which
were
not
extinguished
we
then
kindled
a
large
heap
of
sticks
and
dried
grass
well
the
smoke
passing
through
the
opening
like
a
chimney
having
no
uneasiness
about
this
we
deferred
our
commencement
till
the
next
day
then
we
lighted
the
forge
and
pointed
some
iron
bars
we
found
in
the
magazine
these
were
to
be
our
tools
to
break
open
the
rock
we
secured
also
your
chisel
as
well
as
some
hammers
and
all
our
tools
were
thrown
down
below
we
then
arranged
two
gourds
to
serve
us
for
lamps
and
when
all
was
ready
and
our
ladder
firmly
fixed
we
descended
ourselves
and
we
have
nothing
more
to
tell
you
except
that
we
were
very
glad
when
we
heard
your
voices
outside
at
the
very
time
when
our
work
was
drawing
to
an
end
we
were
sure
when
we
distinguished
your
voices
so
clearly
that
we
must
be
near
the
external
air
we
redoubled
our
efforts
and
here
we
are
now
tell
us
father
are
you
pleased
with
our
idea
and
will
you
forgive
us
for
making
a
mystery
of
it
i
assured
them
of
my
forgiveness
and
my
cordial
approbation
of
their
manly
and
useful
enterprise
and
made
ernest
happy
by
declaring
that
it
should
always
be
called
the
thanks
to
you
all
my
dear
children
said
i
your
dear
mamma
will
now
prefer
tent
house
to
falcon
nest
and
will
have
no
occasion
to
risk
breaking
a
limb
in
descending
the
winding
staircase
i
will
assist
you
to
enlarge
the
opening
and
as
we
will
leave
it
all
the
simplicity
of
a
natural
grotto
it
will
soon
be
ready
we
all
set
to
work
jack
carried
away
the
loosened
stones
and
rubbish
and
formed
benches
on
each
side
the
grotto
with
what
had
fallen
outside
he
also
made
two
seats
in
the
front
of
the
rock
and
before
evening
all
was
complete
fritz
ascended
to
unfasten
the
ladder
and
to
convey
it
by
an
easier
road
to
tent
house
he
then
rejoined
us
and
we
returned
to
our
castle
in
the
air
which
was
henceforward
only
to
be
looked
on
as
a
we
resolved
however
to
establish
here
as
we
had
done
at
our
farm
a
colony
of
our
cattle
which
increased
daily
we
had
now
a
number
of
young
cows
which
were
most
useful
for
our
support
we
wished
however
for
a
female
buffalo
as
the
milk
of
that
animal
makes
excellent
cheese
conversing
on
our
future
plans
we
soon
reached
home
and
found
all
well
chapter
xlii
in
a
few
days
we
completed
the
it
contained
some
stalactites
but
not
so
many
as
our
former
grotto
we
found
however
a
beautiful
block
of
salt
which
resembled
white
marble
of
which
ernest
formed
a
sort
of
altar
supported
by
four
pillars
on
which
he
placed
a
pretty
vase
of
which
he
had
turned
himself
and
in
which
he
arranged
some
of
the
beautiful
which
had
been
the
cause
of
his
discovering
the
grotto
it
was
one
of
those
occasions
when
his
feelings
overcame
his
natural
indolence
when
he
became
for
a
time
the
most
active
of
the
four
and
brought
forward
all
his
resources
which
were
many
this
indolence
was
merely
physical
when
not
excited
by
any
sudden
circumstance
or
by
some
fancy
which
soon
assumed
the
character
of
a
passion
he
loved
ease
and
to
enjoy
life
tranquilly
in
study
he
improved
his
mind
continually
as
well
by
his
excellent
memory
as
by
natural
talent
and
application
he
reflected
made
experiments
and
was
always
successful
he
had
at
last
succeeded
in
making
his
mother
a
very
pretty
bonnet
he
had
also
composed
some
verses
which
were
intended
to
celebrate
her
visit
to
tent
house
and
this
joyful
day
being
at
last
fixed
the
boys
all
went
over
the
evening
before
to
make
their
preparations
the
flowers
that
the
storm
had
spared
were
gathered
to
ornament
the
fountains
the
altar
and
the
table
on
which
was
placed
an
excellent
cold
dinner
entirely
prepared
by
themselves
fritz
supplied
and
roasted
the
game
a
fine
bustard
the
flesh
of
which
resembles
a
turkey
and
a
brace
of
partridges
ernest
brought
pines
melons
and
figs
jack
should
have
supplied
the
fish
but
was
able
only
to
procure
oysters
crabs
and
turtles
eggs
francis
had
the
charge
of
the
dessert
which
consisted
of
a
dish
of
strawberries
honeycomb
and
the
cream
of
the
i
had
contributed
a
bottle
of
canary
wine
that
we
might
drink
mamma
health
all
was
arranged
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
and
my
sons
returned
to
accompany
the
expedition
next
day
the
morning
was
beautiful
and
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
our
emigration
my
wife
was
anxious
to
set
out
expecting
she
should
have
to
return
to
her
aërial
dwelling
though
her
leg
and
foot
were
better
she
still
walked
feebly
and
she
begged
us
to
harness
the
cow
and
ass
to
the
cart
and
to
lead
them
as
gently
as
possible
i
will
only
go
a
little
way
the
first
day
said
she
for
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
visit
tent
house
yet
we
felt
quite
convinced
she
would
change
her
opinion
when
once
in
her
litter
i
wished
to
carry
her
down
the
staircase
but
she
declined
and
descended
very
well
with
the
help
of
my
arm
when
the
door
was
opened
and
she
found
herself
once
more
in
the
open
air
surrounded
by
her
children
she
thanked
god
with
tears
of
gratitude
for
her
recovery
and
all
his
mercies
to
us
then
the
pretty
osier
carriage
arrived
they
had
harnessed
the
cow
and
young
bull
to
it
francis
answering
for
the
docility
of
valiant
provided
he
guided
him
himself
accordingly
he
was
mounted
before
his
cane
in
his
hand
and
his
bow
and
quiver
on
his
back
very
proud
to
be
mamma
charioteer
my
other
three
boys
mounted
on
their
animals
were
ready
before
to
form
the
advanced
guard
while
i
proposed
to
follow
and
watch
over
the
whole
my
wife
was
moved
even
to
tears
and
could
not
cease
admiring
her
new
carriage
which
fritz
and
jack
presented
to
her
as
their
own
work
francis
however
boasted
that
he
had
carded
the
cotton
for
the
soft
cushion
on
which
she
was
to
sit
and
i
that
i
had
made
it
i
then
lifted
her
in
and
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
ernest
came
to
put
her
new
bonnet
on
her
head
which
greatly
delighted
her
it
was
of
fine
straw
and
so
thick
and
firm
that
it
might
even
defend
her
from
the
rain
but
what
pleased
her
most
was
that
it
was
the
shape
worn
by
the
swiss
peasants
in
the
canton
of
vaud
where
my
dear
wife
had
resided
some
time
in
her
youth
she
thanked
all
her
dear
children
and
felt
so
easy
and
comfortable
in
her
new
conveyance
that
we
arrived
at
family
bridge
without
her
feeling
the
least
fatigue
here
we
stopped
would
you
like
to
cross
here
my
dear
said
i
and
as
we
are
very
near
look
in
at
your
convenient
tent
house
where
you
will
have
no
staircase
to
ascend
and
we
should
like
to
know
too
if
you
approve
of
our
management
of
your
garden
as
you
please
said
she
in
fact
i
am
so
comfortable
in
my
carriage
that
if
it
were
necessary
i
could
make
the
tour
of
the
island
i
should
like
to
see
my
house
again
but
it
will
be
so
very
hot
at
this
season
that
we
must
not
stay
long
but
you
must
dine
there
my
dear
mother
said
fritz
it
is
too
late
to
return
to
dinner
at
falcon
nest
consider
too
the
fatigue
it
would
occasion
you
i
would
be
very
glad
indeed
my
dear
said
she
but
what
are
we
to
dine
on
we
have
prepared
no
provision
and
i
fear
we
shall
all
be
hungry
what
matter
said
jack
provided
you
dine
with
us
you
must
take
your
chance
i
will
go
and
get
some
oysters
that
we
may
not
die
with
hunger
and
off
he
galloped
on
his
buffalo
fritz
followed
him
on
some
pretence
on
lightfoot
mamma
wished
she
had
brought
a
vessel
to
carry
some
water
from
the
river
for
she
knew
we
could
get
none
at
tent
house
francis
reminded
her
we
could
milk
the
cow
and
she
was
satisfied
and
enjoyed
her
journey
much
at
last
we
arrived
before
the
colonnade
my
wife
was
dumb
with
wonder
for
some
moments
where
am
i
and
what
do
i
see
said
she
when
she
could
speak
you
see
the
mamma
said
her
little
boy
this
beautiful
colonnade
was
my
invention
to
protect
you
from
the
heat
stay
read
what
is
written
above
to
his
dear
mother
may
this
colonnade
which
is
called
the
franciade
be
to
her
a
temple
of
now
mamma
lean
on
me
and
come
and
see
my
brothers
gifts
much
better
than
mine
and
he
led
her
to
jack
pavilion
who
was
standing
by
the
fountain
he
held
a
shell
in
his
hand
which
he
filled
with
water
and
drank
saying
to
the
health
of
the
queen
of
the
island
may
she
have
no
more
accidents
and
live
as
long
as
her
children
long
live
queen
elizabeth
and
may
she
come
every
day
to
to
drink
her
son
jack
health
i
supported
my
wife
and
was
almost
as
much
affected
as
herself
she
wept
and
trembled
with
joy
and
surprise
jack
and
ernest
then
joined
their
hands
and
carried
her
to
the
other
pavilion
where
fritz
was
waiting
to
receive
her
and
the
same
scene
of
tenderness
ensued
accept
this
pavilion
dear
mother
said
he
and
may
ever
make
you
think
on
fritz
the
delighted
mother
embraced
them
all
and
observing
ernest
name
was
not
commemorated
by
any
trophy
thanked
him
again
for
her
beautiful
bonnet
she
then
drank
some
of
the
delicious
water
of
the
fountain
and
returned
to
seat
herself
at
the
repast
which
was
another
surprise
for
her
we
all
made
an
excellent
dinner
and
at
the
dessert
i
handed
my
canary
wine
round
in
shells
and
then
ernest
rose
and
sung
us
very
prettily
to
a
familiar
air
some
little
verses
he
had
composed
on
this
festive
happy
day
let
us
pour
our
grateful
lay
since
heaven
has
hush
our
mother
pain
and
given
her
to
her
sons
again
then
from
this
quiet
lovely
home
never
never
may
we
roam
all
we
love
around
us
smile
joyful
is
our
desert
isle
when
our
mother
couch
we
bent
fervent
prayers
to
heaven
we
sent
and
god
has
spared
that
mother
dear
to
bless
her
happy
children
here
then
from
this
quiet
lovely
home
never
never
may
we
roam
all
we
love
around
us
smile
joyful
is
our
desert
isle
we
all
joined
in
the
chorus
and
none
of
us
thought
of
the
ship
of
europe
or
of
anything
that
was
passing
in
the
world
the
island
was
our
universe
and
tent
house
was
a
palace
we
would
not
have
exchanged
for
any
the
world
contained
this
was
one
of
those
happy
days
that
god
grants
us
sometimes
on
earth
to
give
us
an
idea
of
the
bliss
of
heaven
and
most
fervently
did
we
thank
him
at
the
end
of
our
repast
for
all
his
mercies
and
blessings
to
us
after
dinner
i
told
my
wife
she
must
not
think
of
returning
to
nest
with
all
its
risks
of
storms
and
the
winding
staircase
and
she
could
not
better
recompense
her
sons
for
their
labours
than
by
living
among
them
she
was
of
the
same
opinion
and
was
very
glad
to
be
so
near
her
kitchen
and
her
stores
and
to
be
able
to
walk
alone
with
the
assistance
of
a
stick
in
the
colonnade
which
she
could
do
already
but
she
made
me
promise
to
leave
falcon
nest
as
it
was
it
would
be
a
pretty
place
to
walk
to
and
besides
this
castle
in
the
air
was
her
own
invention
we
agreed
that
this
very
evening
she
should
take
possession
of
her
own
pretty
room
with
the
good
felt
carpet
on
which
she
could
walk
without
fear
and
that
the
next
day
i
should
go
with
my
elder
sons
and
the
animals
to
bring
the
cart
such
utensils
as
we
needed
and
above
all
the
poultry
our
dogs
always
followed
their
masters
as
well
as
the
monkey
and
jackal
and
they
were
so
domesticated
we
had
no
trouble
with
them
i
then
prevailed
on
my
wife
to
go
into
her
room
and
rest
for
an
hour
after
which
we
were
to
visit
the
garden
she
complied
and
after
her
repose
found
her
four
sons
ready
to
carry
her
in
her
litter
as
in
a
they
took
care
to
bring
her
straight
to
the
grotto
where
i
was
waiting
for
her
this
was
a
new
surprise
for
the
good
mother
she
could
not
sufficiently
express
her
astonishment
and
delight
when
jack
and
francis
taking
their
flageolets
accompanied
their
brothers
who
sung
the
following
verse
which
ernest
had
added
to
his
former
attempt
dear
mother
let
this
gift
be
mine
accept
the
grotto
ernestine
may
all
your
hours
be
doubly
blest
within
this
tranquil
place
of
rest
then
from
this
quiet
lovely
home
never
never
may
we
roam
all
we
love
around
us
smile
joyful
is
our
desert
isle
what
cause
had
we
to
rejoice
in
our
children
we
could
not
but
shed
tears
to
witness
their
affection
and
perfect
happiness
below
the
vase
of
flowers
on
the
block
of
salt
ernest
had
written
ernest
assisted
by
his
brother
fritz
has
prepared
this
grotto
as
a
retreat
for
his
beloved
mother
when
she
visits
her
garden
ernest
then
conducted
his
mother
to
one
of
the
benches
which
he
had
covered
with
soft
moss
as
a
seat
for
her
and
there
she
rested
at
her
ease
to
hear
the
history
of
the
discovery
of
the
grotto
it
was
now
my
turn
to
offer
my
present
the
garden
the
embankment
the
pond
and
the
arbour
she
walked
supported
by
my
arm
to
view
her
little
empire
and
her
delight
was
extreme
the
pond
which
enabled
her
to
water
her
vegetables
particularly
pleased
her
as
well
as
her
shady
arbour
under
which
she
found
all
her
gardening
tools
ornamented
with
flowers
and
augmented
by
two
light
constructed
by
jack
and
francis
from
two
gourds
they
had
canes
for
spouts
with
the
gourd
bottles
at
the
end
pierced
with
holes
through
which
the
water
came
in
the
manner
of
a
the
embankment
was
also
a
great
surprise
she
proposed
to
place
plants
of
pines
and
melon
on
it
and
i
agreed
to
it
truly
did
she
rejoice
at
the
appearance
of
the
vegetables
which
promised
us
some
excellent
european
provision
a
great
comfort
to
her
after
expressing
her
grateful
feelings
she
returned
to
the
grotto
and
seating
herself
in
her
returned
to
tent
house
to
enjoy
the
repose
she
needed
after
such
a
day
of
excitement
we
did
not
however
lie
down
before
we
had
together
thanked
god
for
the
manifold
blessings
he
had
given
us
and
for
the
pleasure
of
that
day
if
i
had
been
in
europe
said
my
dear
wife
on
the
festival
of
my
recovery
i
should
have
received
a
nosegay
a
ribbon
or
some
trinket
here
i
have
had
presented
a
carriage
a
colonnade
pavilions
ornamental
fountains
a
large
grotto
a
garden
a
pond
an
arbour
and
a
straw
bonnet
chapter
xliii
the
next
and
following
days
were
spent
in
removing
our
furniture
and
property
particularly
our
poultry
which
had
multiplied
greatly
we
also
constructed
a
at
a
sufficient
distance
from
our
house
to
save
our
sleep
from
disturbance
and
still
so
near
that
we
could
easily
tend
them
we
made
it
as
a
continuation
of
the
colonnade
and
on
the
same
plan
but
enclosed
in
the
front
by
a
sort
of
wire
which
fritz
and
jack
made
wonderfully
well
fritz
who
had
a
turn
for
architecture
and
mechanics
gave
me
some
good
hints
especially
one
which
we
put
into
execution
this
was
to
carry
the
water
from
the
basin
of
the
fountain
through
the
which
enabled
us
also
to
have
a
little
pond
for
our
ducks
the
pigeons
had
their
abode
above
the
in
some
pretty
baskets
which
ernest
and
francis
made
similar
to
those
made
by
the
savages
of
the
friendly
isles
of
which
they
had
seen
engravings
in
cook
voyages
when
all
was
finished
my
wife
was
delighted
to
think
that
even
in
the
rainy
season
she
could
attend
to
her
feathered
family
and
collect
their
eggs
what
a
difference
said
she
admiring
the
elegance
of
our
buildings
what
a
difference
between
this
tent
house
and
the
original
dwelling
that
suggested
the
name
to
us
and
which
was
our
only
shelter
four
years
ago
what
a
surprising
progress
luxury
has
made
with
us
in
that
time
do
you
remember
my
dear
the
barrel
which
served
us
for
a
table
and
the
for
spoons
the
tent
where
we
slept
crowded
together
on
dried
leaves
and
without
undressing
and
the
river
half
a
mile
off
where
we
were
obliged
to
go
to
drink
if
we
were
thirsty
compared
to
what
we
were
then
we
are
now
great
kings
you
mean
mamma
said
jack
for
all
this
island
is
ours
and
it
is
quite
like
a
kingdom
and
how
many
millions
of
subjects
does
prince
jack
reckon
in
the
kingdom
of
his
august
father
said
i
prince
jack
declared
he
had
not
yet
counted
the
parrots
kangaroos
agoutis
and
monkeys
the
laughter
of
his
brothers
stopped
him
i
then
agreed
with
my
wife
that
our
luxuries
had
increased
but
i
explained
to
her
that
this
was
the
result
of
our
industry
all
civilized
nations
have
commenced
as
we
did
necessity
has
developed
the
intellect
which
god
has
given
to
man
alone
and
by
degrees
the
arts
have
progressed
and
knowledge
has
extended
more
perhaps
than
is
conducive
to
happiness
what
appeared
luxury
to
us
now
was
still
simplicity
compared
with
the
luxury
of
towns
or
even
villages
among
civilized
nations
my
wife
declared
she
had
everything
she
wished
for
and
should
not
know
what
more
to
ask
for
as
we
now
had
only
to
rest
and
enjoy
our
happiness
i
declared
against
spending
our
time
in
rest
and
indolence
as
the
sure
means
of
ending
our
pleasure
and
i
well
knew
my
dear
wife
was
like
myself
an
enemy
to
idleness
but
she
dreaded
any
more
laborious
undertakings
but
mamma
said
fritz
you
must
let
me
make
a
mill
under
the
cascade
it
will
be
so
useful
when
our
corn
grows
and
even
now
for
the
maize
i
also
think
of
making
an
oven
in
the
kitchen
which
will
be
very
useful
for
you
to
bake
your
bread
in
these
would
indeed
be
useful
labours
said
the
good
mother
smiling
but
can
you
accomplish
them
i
hope
so
said
fritz
with
the
help
of
god
and
that
of
my
dear
brothers
ernest
promised
his
best
aid
in
return
for
his
brother
kind
services
in
forming
his
grotto
only
requesting
occasional
leisure
for
his
natural
history
collections
his
mother
did
not
see
the
utility
of
these
collections
but
willing
to
indulge
her
kind
and
attentive
ernest
she
offered
till
she
could
walk
well
to
assist
him
in
arranging
and
labelling
his
plants
which
were
yet
in
disorder
and
he
gratefully
consented
in
procuring
her
some
paper
for
the
purpose
of
which
i
had
brought
a
large
quantity
from
the
vessel
i
brought
out
an
unopened
packet
amongst
which
was
a
piece
of
some
fabric
neither
paper
nor
stuff
apparently
we
examined
it
together
and
at
length
remembered
it
was
a
piece
of
stuff
made
at
otaheite
which
our
captain
had
bought
of
a
native
at
an
island
where
we
had
touched
on
our
voyage
fritz
appearing
much
interested
in
examining
this
cloth
ernest
said
gravely
i
can
teach
you
how
to
make
it
and
immediately
bringing
where
a
detailed
description
is
given
he
proceeded
to
read
it
fritz
was
disappointed
to
find
it
could
only
be
made
of
the
bark
of
three
trees
of
these
our
island
produced
only
one
these
trees
were
the
the
bread
fruit
and
the
wild
fig
we
had
the
last
in
abundance
but
of
the
two
former
we
had
not
yet
discovered
a
single
plant
fritz
was
not
however
discouraged
they
ought
to
be
here
said
he
since
they
are
found
in
all
the
islands
perhaps
we
may
find
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
rocks
where
i
saw
some
superb
unknown
trees
from
the
height
where
we
discovered
the
grotto
and
who
knows
but
i
may
find
my
pretty
gazelle
there
again
the
rogue
can
leap
better
than
i
can
over
those
rocks
i
had
a
great
wish
to
descend
them
but
found
it
impossible
some
are
very
high
and
perpendicular
others
have
overhanging
summits
i
might
however
get
round
as
you
did
by
the
pass
between
the
torrent
and
the
rocks
at
the
great
bay
jack
offered
to
be
his
guide
even
with
his
eyes
shut
into
that
rich
country
where
he
conquered
and
captured
his
buffalo
and
ernest
begged
to
be
of
the
party
as
this
was
an
expedition
i
had
long
projected
i
agreed
to
accompany
them
next
day
their
mother
being
content
to
have
francis
left
with
her
as
a
protector
i
cautioned
fritz
not
to
fire
off
his
gun
when
we
approached
the
buffaloes
as
any
show
of
hostility
might
render
them
furious
otherwise
the
animals
unaccustomed
to
man
have
no
fear
of
him
and
will
not
harm
him
in
general
added
i
i
can
not
sufficiently
recommend
to
you
to
be
careful
of
your
powder
we
have
not
more
than
will
last
us
a
year
and
there
may
be
a
necessity
to
have
recourse
to
it
for
our
defence
i
have
a
plan
for
making
it
said
fritz
who
never
saw
a
difficulty
in
anything
i
know
it
is
composed
of
charcoal
saltpetre
and
sulphur
and
we
ought
to
find
all
these
materials
in
the
island
it
is
only
necessary
to
combine
them
and
to
form
it
into
little
round
grains
this
is
my
only
difficulty
but
i
will
consider
it
over
and
i
have
my
mill
to
think
on
first
i
have
a
confused
recollection
of
a
powder
manufactory
at
berne
there
was
some
machinery
which
went
by
water
this
machinery
moved
some
hammers
which
pounded
and
mixed
the
ingredients
was
not
this
the
case
father
something
like
it
said
i
but
we
have
many
things
to
do
before
making
powder
first
we
must
go
to
sleep
we
must
set
out
before
daybreak
if
we
intend
to
return
evening
we
did
indeed
rise
before
the
sun
which
would
not
rise
for
us
the
sky
was
very
cloudy
and
shortly
we
had
an
abundant
and
incessant
rain
which
obliged
us
to
defer
our
journey
and
put
us
all
in
bad
humour
but
my
wife
who
was
not
sorry
to
keep
us
with
her
and
who
declared
this
gracious
rain
would
water
her
garden
and
bring
it
forward
fritz
was
the
first
who
consoled
himself
he
thought
on
nothing
but
building
mills
and
manufacturing
gunpowder
he
begged
me
to
draw
him
a
mill
this
was
very
easy
so
far
as
regards
the
exterior
that
is
the
wheel
and
the
waterfall
that
sets
it
in
motion
but
the
interior
the
disposition
of
the
wheels
the
stones
to
bruise
the
grain
the
sieve
or
bolter
to
separate
the
flour
from
the
bran
all
this
complicated
machinery
was
difficult
to
explain
but
he
comprehended
all
adding
his
usual
expression
i
will
try
and
i
shall
succeed
not
to
lose
any
time
and
to
profit
by
this
rainy
day
he
began
by
making
sieves
of
different
materials
which
he
fastened
to
a
circle
of
pliant
wood
and
tried
by
passing
through
them
the
flour
of
the
cassava
he
made
some
with
sailcloth
others
with
the
hair
of
the
onagra
which
is
very
long
and
strong
and
some
of
the
fibres
of
bark
his
mother
admired
his
work
which
he
continued
to
improve
more
and
more
she
assured
him
the
sieve
would
be
sufficient
for
her
it
was
useless
to
have
the
trouble
of
building
a
mill
but
how
shall
we
bruise
the
grain
mamma
said
he
it
would
be
tedious
and
hard
work
and
you
think
there
will
be
no
hard
work
in
building
your
mill
said
jack
i
am
curious
to
see
how
you
will
contrive
to
form
that
huge
stone
which
is
called
the
millstone
you
shall
see
said
fritz
only
find
me
the
stone
and
it
shall
soon
be
done
do
you
think
father
that
of
our
rock
would
be
suitable
i
told
him
i
thought
it
would
be
hard
enough
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
cut
from
the
rock
a
piece
large
enough
for
the
purpose
he
made
his
usual
reply
will
ernest
and
jack
will
assist
me
and
perhaps
you
papa
i
declared
my
willingness
but
named
him
the
we
must
only
be
his
workmen
francis
was
impatient
to
see
the
mill
in
operation
oh
said
jack
you
shall
soon
have
that
pleasure
it
is
a
mere
trifle
we
only
want
stone
wood
tools
and
science
at
the
word
ernest
who
was
reading
in
a
corner
without
listening
to
us
raised
his
head
suddenly
saying
what
science
are
you
in
need
of
of
one
you
know
nothing
of
philosopher
said
jack
come
tell
us
do
you
know
how
to
build
a
mill
a
mill
answered
ernest
of
what
description
there
are
many
sorts
i
was
just
looking
in
my
dictionary
for
it
there
are
and
and
which
do
you
want
fritz
would
have
liked
them
all
you
remind
me
said
i
that
we
brought
from
the
vessel
a
and
a
taken
to
pieces
to
be
sure
but
numbered
and
labelled
so
that
they
could
be
easily
united
they
should
be
in
the
magazine
where
you
found
the
anvil
and
iron
bars
i
had
forgotten
them
let
us
go
and
examine
them
said
fritz
lighting
his
lantern
i
shall
get
some
ideas
from
them
rather
said
his
mother
they
will
spare
you
the
trouble
of
thinking
and
labouring
i
sent
them
all
four
to
seek
these
treasures
which
heaped
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
had
escaped
my
recollection
when
we
were
alone
i
seriously
besought
my
wife
not
to
oppose
any
occupations
our
children
might
plan
however
they
might
seem
beyond
their
power
the
great
point
being
to
keep
them
continually
occupied
so
that
no
evil
or
dangerous
fancies
might
fill
their
minds
let
them
i
said
cut
stone
fell
trees
or
dig
fountains
and
bless
god
that
their
thoughts
are
so
innocently
directed
she
understood
me
and
promised
not
to
discourage
them
only
fearing
the
excessive
fatigue
of
these
undertakings
our
boys
returned
from
the
magazine
delighted
with
what
they
had
found
and
loaded
with
those
of
the
masons
the
chisel
the
short
hammer
and
the
trowel
were
not
to
be
found
and
rarely
are
taken
out
to
sea
but
they
had
collected
a
great
number
of
tools
saws
planes
rules
and
now
that
fritz
was
a
smith
he
had
no
difficulty
in
making
any
tool
he
wanted
he
was
loaded
on
each
shoulder
and
in
each
hand
he
brought
a
specimen
of
gunpowder
one
sort
was
in
good
condition
and
they
had
found
a
barrel
of
it
the
other
was
much
damaged
by
the
water
jack
and
francis
were
also
bending
under
the
weight
of
various
articles
among
which
i
saw
some
pieces
of
the
fritz
wished
to
examine
ernest
always
rather
idle
came
proudly
on
with
a
leather
belt
across
his
shoulders
to
which
was
suspended
a
large
tin
box
for
plants
and
a
leather
portmanteau
for
stones
minerals
and
shells
his
brothers
even
francis
rallied
him
unmercifully
on
his
immense
burden
one
offered
to
help
him
another
to
go
and
bring
the
ass
he
preserved
his
grave
and
thoughtful
air
and
extended
himself
on
a
seat
near
his
mother
who
was
occupied
with
his
specimens
of
natural
history
jack
deposited
his
load
in
a
corner
and
ran
out
we
soon
saw
him
return
with
a
huge
on
his
head
which
he
placed
before
ernest
saying
with
an
air
of
respect
i
have
the
honour
to
bring
for
his
highness
the
prince
of
the
idle
penguins
the
press
for
his
august
plants
which
his
highness
doubtless
found
too
heavy
and
truly
it
is
no
little
weight
ernest
did
not
know
whether
to
thank
him
or
to
be
angry
but
he
decided
to
join
in
the
jest
and
therefore
answered
gravely
that
he
was
distressed
that
his
highness
the
prince
of
the
monkeys
should
have
taken
so
much
trouble
to
oblige
him
that
he
ought
to
have
employed
some
of
his
docile
subjects
to
do
it
after
all
he
confessed
that
the
press
which
he
had
not
noticed
gave
him
great
pleasure
and
he
placed
some
plants
in
it
immediately
which
he
had
collected
the
evening
before
the
rain
ceasing
for
a
short
time
i
went
with
fritz
and
jack
to
examine
our
embankment
and
to
open
the
sluices
of
the
pond
we
found
all
right
and
our
garden
looking
beautiful
after
the
rain
on
our
return
we
looked
in
at
the
ernestine
which
we
found
inundated
from
the
opening
above
we
proposed
to
make
a
trench
or
little
channel
to
carry
off
the
from
it
we
returned
home
and
retired
to
bed
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
set
out
next
morning
we
were
however
again
disappointed
and
for
a
longer
period
than
we
expected
the
rain
continued
some
days
and
the
country
was
again
a
complete
lake
we
had
however
no
storm
or
wind
and
our
possessions
did
not
suffer
so
we
resolved
to
wait
patiently
till
the
weather
would
permit
us
to
go
my
wife
was
delighted
to
be
in
her
comfortable
abode
and
to
have
us
round
her
neither
did
we
waste
the
time
ernest
finished
the
arrangement
of
his
collection
with
his
mother
and
francis
fritz
and
jack
prepared
the
tools
that
would
be
wanted
in
their
great
undertaking
the
first
attempt
was
to
be
a
in
order
to
prepare
the
planks
they
wished
a
very
large
saw
which
they
had
found
amongst
the
tools
would
serve
their
purpose
but
it
was
necessary
to
set
it
in
motion
by
water
and
here
was
the
difficulty
fritz
made
several
models
from
the
thin
wood
of
our
chests
and
the
wheels
of
our
guns
but
they
were
too
small
in
the
mean
time
the
mind
of
my
young
mechanic
was
exercised
his
ideas
were
enlarged
and
improved
and
as
this
science
was
so
necessary
in
our
situation
i
allowed
him
to
go
on
with
his
experiments
notwithstanding
the
rain
protected
by
my
cloak
he
went
several
times
to
the
cascade
to
look
out
for
a
place
where
he
should
place
his
mills
to
the
best
advantage
and
have
a
constant
supply
of
water
ernest
assisted
him
by
his
advice
and
promised
his
labour
when
it
should
be
needed
jack
and
francis
were
helping
their
mother
to
card
cotton
of
which
she
had
made
a
large
collection
intending
to
spin
it
for
our
clothing
and
i
exercised
my
mechanical
talents
in
turning
a
large
wheel
for
her
which
it
was
necessary
should
revolve
very
easily
her
leg
being
still
stiff
and
a
reel
by
which
four
bobbins
were
filled
at
once
by
turning
a
handle
these
different
occupations
aided
us
to
pass
the
rainy
season
which
visited
us
earlier
this
year
and
did
not
remain
so
long
my
wife
knew
something
of
dyeing
cloth
and
some
of
the
plants
she
had
helped
ernest
to
dry
having
left
their
colour
on
the
papers
she
made
some
experiments
and
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
very
pretty
blue
to
dye
our
clothes
with
and
with
the
cochineal
from
our
a
beautiful
red
brown
with
which
she
had
dyed
for
herself
a
complete
dress
thus
passed
several
weeks
ernest
read
to
us
from
some
amusing
or
instructive
work
every
evening
and
when
his
collections
were
all
put
in
order
he
worked
at
his
lathe
or
at
the
business
of
weaving
at
last
the
sun
appeared
we
spent
some
days
enjoying
it
in
our
delightful
colonnade
we
went
to
visit
the
grotto
and
the
garden
where
all
was
going
on
well
the
embankment
had
prevented
the
inundation
satisfied
with
our
work
we
now
fixed
our
departure
for
the
next
day
once
more
hoping
the
rain
would
not
come
again
to
disappoint
us
chapter
xliv
the
next
day
the
weather
was
delightful
we
rose
before
daybreak
my
eldest
sons
took
their
which
we
might
want
and
their
guns
also
but
under
the
condition
that
they
should
not
use
them
till
i
gave
the
word
fire
i
carried
the
bag
of
provisions
our
flock
of
sheep
had
increased
so
much
at
the
farm
that
we
allowed
ourselves
to
kill
one
and
my
wife
had
roasted
a
piece
for
us
the
preceding
evening
to
this
we
added
a
cake
of
cassava
and
for
our
dessert
we
depended
on
the
fruits
of
the
trees
we
might
discover
but
previous
to
our
departure
while
i
was
taking
leave
of
my
wife
and
francis
i
heard
a
dispute
in
the
colonnade
which
i
hastened
to
learn
the
cause
of
i
found
it
was
a
question
between
fritz
and
jack
whether
we
should
make
the
tour
of
the
island
by
sea
or
land
and
each
was
anxious
for
my
support
fritz
complained
that
since
their
two
expeditions
in
the
canoe
jack
believed
himself
the
first
sailor
in
the
world
and
that
they
had
given
him
the
name
of
lord
of
the
waves
because
he
was
constantly
saying
when
i
was
under
the
waves
when
the
waves
were
washing
over
me
do
you
think
that
they
left
me
dry
no
sportsman
said
jack
you
got
enough
of
them
and
that
the
reason
you
do
wish
to
try
them
again
for
my
part
i
love
the
waves
and
i
sing
sea
the
sea
it
was
the
sea
that
brought
us
here
what
a
boaster
you
are
said
fritz
it
was
only
yesterday
you
said
to
me
will
guide
you
i
know
the
way
by
the
rocks
i
got
my
buffalo
there
and
i
intend
to
have
another
was
it
in
the
pinnace
you
intended
to
pass
the
defile
and
pursue
buffaloes
no
no
i
meant
on
foot
said
jack
but
i
thought
we
should
be
only
two
then
but
as
we
are
four
papa
at
the
helm
and
three
bold
rowers
why
should
we
fatigue
ourselves
in
making
the
tour
of
the
island
on
our
legs
when
we
have
a
good
vessel
to
carry
us
what
says
philosopher
the
prince
of
idlers
to
it
for
my
part
said
ernest
quietly
i
am
quite
indifferent
whether
i
use
my
legs
in
walking
or
my
arms
in
rowing
it
is
equally
fatiguing
but
walking
gives
me
more
chance
of
filling
my
and
my
and
does
he
think
added
fritz
that
the
mulberry
and
trees
which
we
shall
certainly
find
on
the
other
side
grow
on
the
sea
without
naming
my
gazelle
which
does
not
run
over
the
waves
no
it
is
waiting
without
moving
for
you
to
shoot
it
said
jack
and
ernest
perhaps
you
may
find
on
the
sea
some
of
those
curious
things
half
plants
half
animals
which
you
were
showing
me
in
a
book
the
zoophytes
or
polypi
for
they
are
the
same
family
though
there
are
more
than
a
thousand
species
said
ernest
charmed
to
display
his
knowledge
but
i
stopped
him
by
saying
we
will
dispense
with
the
thousand
names
at
present
after
hearing
all
your
arguments
attend
to
mine
even
jack
must
yield
to
them
our
principal
aim
now
being
to
search
for
the
trees
we
are
in
need
of
and
to
examine
the
productions
of
the
island
our
most
sensible
plan
will
be
to
walk
jack
still
contended
that
we
might
land
occasionally
but
i
showed
him
the
danger
of
this
the
island
being
in
all
probability
surrounded
by
reefs
which
might
extend
so
far
into
the
sea
as
to
take
us
out
of
the
sight
of
the
island
this
i
intended
to
ascertain
some
day
and
in
the
mean
time
i
proposed
to
them
that
we
should
endeavour
to
find
a
pass
round
the
rocks
on
our
side
from
whence
we
could
walk
to
the
defile
at
the
other
end
take
our
canoe
which
we
had
left
at
anchor
near
the
great
bay
and
return
to
tent
house
jack
was
in
ecstasies
he
declared
the
pass
must
be
very
well
concealed
that
escaped
his
search
and
seizing
his
lasso
and
his
bow
rushed
out
the
first
singing
the
sea
the
sea
there
goes
a
sailor
formed
by
nature
thought
i
as
we
followed
the
course
of
the
chain
of
rocks
to
the
left
of
our
dwelling
it
conducted
us
first
to
the
place
of
our
landing
that
little
uncultivated
plain
of
triangular
form
of
which
the
base
was
washed
by
the
sea
and
the
point
was
lost
among
the
rocks
i
found
here
some
traces
of
our
first
establishment
but
how
wretched
all
appeared
compared
with
our
present
comforts
we
tried
here
in
vain
to
find
a
passage
to
cross
the
rocks
the
chain
was
everywhere
like
an
impenetrable
wall
we
arrived
at
the
ravine
fritz
and
ernest
had
scaled
when
they
discovered
their
grotto
and
truly
nothing
but
the
courage
and
rashness
of
youth
could
have
undertaken
this
enterprise
and
continued
it
daily
for
three
weeks
it
appeared
to
me
almost
impossible
fritz
offered
to
ascend
to
show
me
how
they
accomplished
it
but
i
would
not
consent
as
it
could
serve
no
useful
purpose
i
thought
it
better
for
us
to
proceed
to
the
border
of
the
island
where
it
was
not
impossible
there
might
be
a
small
space
on
the
strand
between
the
rocks
and
the
sea
round
which
we
could
pass
from
my
sons
being
able
to
distinguish
from
the
summit
the
country
on
the
other
side
it
was
evident
the
chain
of
rocks
could
not
be
very
broad
suddenly
fritz
struck
his
forehead
and
seizing
ernest
by
the
arm
brother
said
he
what
fools
we
have
been
ernest
inquired
what
folly
they
had
been
guilty
of
why
did
we
not
said
fritz
when
we
were
working
within
our
grotto
attempt
to
make
the
opening
on
the
other
side
we
should
not
have
had
much
difficulty
i
am
persuaded
and
if
our
tools
had
not
been
sufficient
a
little
powder
would
have
opened
us
a
door
on
the
other
side
only
consider
father
the
convenience
of
bringing
the
cart
loaded
with
the
trees
we
wanted
through
our
grotto
and
to
be
able
to
go
without
having
i
do
know
how
many
miles
to
go
well
we
can
still
do
that
said
ernest
in
his
usual
calm
grave
manner
if
we
do
not
find
another
passage
we
will
make
one
through
the
grotto
ernestine
with
mamma
permission
as
it
is
her
property
this
idea
of
my
son
appeared
good
it
was
quite
certain
from
our
experience
at
tent
house
and
in
the
grotto
that
the
cavity
in
the
rocks
was
of
very
great
extent
and
it
did
not
appear
difficult
to
pierce
through
to
the
other
side
but
some
other
chain
of
rocks
some
gigantic
tree
some
hill
at
the
end
of
our
tunnel
might
render
all
our
labour
useless
i
proposed
that
we
should
defer
our
work
till
we
had
examined
the
nature
of
the
ground
on
the
other
side
my
sons
agreed
and
we
proceeded
with
renewed
courage
when
we
were
suddenly
checked
by
the
sight
of
the
sea
beating
against
a
perpendicular
rock
of
terrific
height
which
terminated
our
island
on
this
side
and
did
not
give
us
a
chance
of
going
on
i
saw
the
rock
did
not
extend
far
but
how
to
get
round
it
i
could
not
devise
i
did
not
conceive
we
could
get
the
pinnace
round
as
the
coast
seemed
surrounded
by
reefs
masses
of
rock
stood
up
in
the
sea
and
the
breakers
showed
that
more
were
hidden
after
much
consideration
and
many
plans
ernest
proposed
that
we
should
swim
out
to
the
uncovered
rocks
and
endeavour
to
pass
round
fritz
objected
on
account
of
his
arms
and
ammunition
but
ernest
suggested
that
the
powder
should
be
secured
in
the
pockets
of
his
clothes
which
he
might
carry
on
his
head
holding
his
gun
above
the
water
with
some
difficulty
we
arranged
our
incumbrances
and
succeeded
in
reaching
the
range
of
outer
rocks
without
swimming
as
the
water
was
not
above
our
shoulders
we
rested
here
awhile
and
putting
on
some
of
our
clothes
we
commenced
our
walk
over
sharp
stones
which
wounded
our
feet
in
many
places
where
the
rocks
lay
low
we
were
up
to
the
waist
in
the
water
ernest
the
proposer
of
the
plan
encouraged
us
and
led
the
way
for
some
time
but
at
last
he
fell
behind
and
remained
so
long
that
i
became
alarmed
and
calling
aloud
for
i
had
lost
sight
of
him
he
answered
me
and
at
last
i
discovered
him
stretched
on
the
rock
endeavouring
to
separate
a
piece
from
it
with
his
knife
father
said
he
i
am
now
certain
that
this
bed
of
rocks
over
which
we
are
walking
and
which
we
fancied
was
formed
of
stone
or
flints
is
nothing
but
the
work
of
those
remarkable
zoophytes
called
coral
insects
which
form
coral
and
many
other
extraordinary
things
they
can
even
make
whole
islands
look
at
these
little
points
and
hollows
and
these
stars
of
every
colour
and
every
form
i
would
give
all
the
world
to
have
a
specimen
of
each
kind
he
succeeded
in
breaking
off
a
piece
which
was
of
a
deep
inside
he
collected
also
and
deposited
in
his
bag
some
other
pieces
of
various
forms
and
colours
these
greatly
enriched
his
collection
and
idle
as
he
was
he
did
not
complain
of
any
difficulty
in
obtaining
them
he
had
given
his
gun
to
jack
who
complained
much
of
the
ruggedness
of
our
road
our
march
was
truly
painful
and
i
repented
more
than
once
of
having
yielded
to
the
idea
besides
the
misery
of
walking
along
these
shelly
rocks
which
presented
points
like
the
sharp
teeth
of
a
saw
tearing
our
shoes
and
even
our
skin
the
sea
in
some
of
the
lower
places
was
so
high
as
to
bar
our
passage
and
we
were
obliged
in
the
interval
between
two
waves
to
rush
across
with
the
water
to
our
chins
we
had
some
difficulty
to
avoid
being
carried
away
i
trembled
especially
for
jack
though
small
and
light
he
preferred
facing
the
wave
to
avoiding
it
i
was
several
times
obliged
to
catch
hold
of
him
and
narrowly
escaped
destruction
along
with
him
happily
our
march
was
not
above
half
a
mile
and
we
gained
the
shore
at
last
without
any
serious
accident
but
much
fatigued
and
and
we
made
a
resolution
never
more
to
cross
the
coral
reefs
after
dressing
ourselves
resting
and
taking
a
slight
refreshment
on
the
beach
we
resumed
our
march
more
at
our
ease
into
the
interior
of
the
island
but
though
the
long
grass
was
not
so
sharp
as
the
coral
it
was
almost
as
troublesome
twisting
round
our
legs
and
threatening
to
throw
us
down
every
step
we
took
ernest
loaded
with
his
bag
of
fragments
of
rock
coral
and
zoophytes
had
given
his
gun
to
jack
and
fearing
an
accident
among
the
long
grass
i
thought
it
prudent
to
discharge
it
in
order
to
profit
by
it
i
fired
at
a
little
quadruped
about
the
size
of
a
squirrel
and
killed
it
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
animal
called
by
naturalists
the
because
it
climbs
the
cocoa
and
hooks
itself
by
its
tail
which
is
very
long
and
flexible
to
the
upper
branches
and
feeds
at
pleasure
on
the
fruit
of
which
it
is
very
fond
we
amused
ourselves
by
details
of
the
habits
of
this
animal
occasionally
separating
to
make
more
discoveries
but
agreeing
on
a
particular
call
which
was
to
assemble
us
when
necessary
a
precaution
by
no
means
useless
as
it
turned
out
fritz
with
his
head
raised
went
on
examining
all
the
trees
and
occasionally
giving
a
keen
look
after
his
gazelle
ernest
stooping
down
examined
plants
insects
and
occasionally
pursuing
rare
and
beautiful
butterflies
was
filling
his
bag
and
with
various
curiosities
jack
with
his
lasso
in
his
hand
prepared
himself
to
fling
it
round
the
legs
of
the
first
buffalo
he
met
with
and
was
vexed
that
he
did
not
see
any
for
my
own
part
i
was
engaged
in
surveying
the
chain
of
rocks
in
order
to
discover
that
which
contained
the
grotto
ernestine
it
was
easy
to
recognize
it
from
its
summit
cleft
in
two
and
i
wished
to
ascertain
as
nearly
as
possible
if
the
cleft
extended
to
the
base
of
the
rock
as
this
would
render
our
work
much
easier
this
side
of
the
island
did
not
resemble
that
near
the
great
bay
with
which
jack
and
i
had
been
so
much
charmed
the
island
was
much
narrower
here
and
instead
of
the
wide
plain
crossed
by
a
river
divided
by
delightful
woods
giving
an
idea
of
paradise
on
earth
we
were
journeying
through
a
contracted
valley
lying
between
the
rocky
wall
which
divided
the
island
and
a
chain
of
sandy
hills
which
hid
the
sea
and
sheltered
the
valley
from
the
wind
fritz
and
i
ascended
one
of
these
hills
on
which
a
few
pines
and
broom
were
growing
and
perceived
beyond
them
a
barren
tract
stretching
to
the
sea
where
the
coral
reefs
rose
to
the
level
of
the
water
and
appeared
to
extend
far
into
the
sea
any
navigators
sailing
along
these
shores
would
pronounce
the
island
inaccessible
and
entirely
barren
this
is
not
the
fact
the
grass
is
very
thick
and
the
trees
of
noble
growth
we
found
many
unknown
to
us
some
loaded
with
fruit
also
several
beautiful
shrubs
covered
with
flowers
the
dwarf
the
elegant
melaleuca
the
and
the
bengal
rose
blending
its
flowers
with
the
fragrant
jasmine
i
should
never
finish
if
i
were
to
try
and
name
all
the
plants
found
in
this
shady
valley
which
might
be
called
the
botanic
garden
of
nature
ernest
was
in
ecstasies
he
wished
to
carry
away
everything
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
dispose
of
them
ah
said
he
if
only
our
grotto
were
open
to
this
side
at
this
moment
fritz
came
running
out
of
breath
crying
out
the
tree
i
have
found
the
tree
here
is
the
fruit
excellent
delicious
bread
taste
it
father
here
ernest
here
jack
and
he
gave
us
each
a
part
of
an
oval
fruit
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
melon
which
really
seemed
very
good
and
nourishing
there
are
many
of
these
trees
continued
he
loaded
with
fruit
would
that
we
had
our
grotto
opened
that
we
might
collect
a
store
of
them
now
that
they
are
ripe
my
boys
pointed
out
to
me
exactly
the
situation
of
the
grotto
judging
from
the
rock
above
and
longed
for
their
tools
that
they
might
commence
the
opening
directly
we
proceeded
to
make
our
way
through
a
border
of
trees
and
bushes
that
separated
us
from
the
rock
that
we
might
examine
it
and
judge
of
the
difficulties
of
our
undertaking
jack
preceded
us
as
usual
after
giving
ernest
his
gun
fritz
followed
him
and
suddenly
turning
to
me
said
i
believe
kind
nature
has
saved
us
much
trouble
the
rock
appears
to
be
divided
from
top
to
bottom
at
the
foot
i
see
a
sort
of
cave
or
grotto
already
made
illustration
we
saw
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
two
large
brown
bears
at
this
moment
jack
uttered
a
piercing
cry
and
came
running
to
us
his
lasso
in
his
hand
two
monstrous
beasts
cried
he
help
help
we
rushed
forward
our
guns
ready
and
saw
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
two
large
brown
bears
the
black
bear
whose
fur
is
most
valued
is
only
found
in
cold
and
mountainous
countries
but
the
brown
prefers
the
south
it
is
a
carnivorous
animal
considered
very
ferocious
the
black
bear
lives
only
on
vegetables
and
honey
of
these
the
one
i
judged
to
be
the
female
seemed
much
irritated
uttering
deep
growls
and
furiously
gnashing
her
teeth
as
i
knew
something
of
these
animals
having
met
with
them
on
the
alps
i
remembered
having
heard
that
a
sharp
whistling
terrifies
and
checks
them
i
therefore
whistled
as
long
and
loudly
as
i
could
and
immediately
saw
the
female
retire
backwards
into
the
cave
while
the
male
raising
himself
on
his
hind
legs
stood
quite
still
with
his
paws
closed
my
two
elder
sons
fired
into
his
breast
he
fell
down
but
being
only
wounded
turned
furiously
on
us
i
fired
a
third
shot
at
him
and
finished
him
we
then
hastened
to
load
our
guns
again
to
be
ready
to
receive
his
companion
jack
wished
to
use
his
lasso
but
i
explained
to
him
that
the
legs
of
the
bear
were
too
short
and
thick
for
such
a
measure
to
be
successful
he
related
to
us
that
having
entered
the
cave
he
saw
something
moving
at
the
bottom
he
took
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
with
all
his
strength
at
the
object
immediately
he
heard
a
frightful
growling
and
saw
two
large
beasts
coming
towards
him
he
had
barely
time
to
escape
and
call
for
help
and
then
to
hide
himself
behind
a
tree
to
save
ourselves
from
the
other
bear
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
take
some
prompt
measures
we
therefore
advanced
and
formed
a
line
of
battle
before
the
entrance
of
the
cave
i
then
gave
the
word
fire
and
we
all
three
fired
off
our
pieces
at
the
same
moment
a
ferocious
roar
made
us
hope
the
bullets
had
taken
effect
but
to
make
sure
and
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
animal
if
it
was
still
living
we
gathered
a
large
heap
of
dried
branches
and
leaves
before
the
opening
to
which
i
set
fire
as
soon
as
it
blazed
we
saw
by
the
light
the
bear
laid
motionless
on
its
side
but
it
is
well
known
that
this
animal
is
crafty
enough
sometimes
to
feign
itself
dead
till
its
enemy
approaches
near
enough
to
be
in
its
power
when
it
seizes
him
in
its
enormous
paws
and
strangles
him
we
took
a
lighted
branch
and
approached
with
great
precaution
the
cave
did
not
extend
far
the
animal
was
lying
on
a
heap
of
dried
leaves
prepared
for
its
young
ones
i
ascertained
that
it
was
really
dead
i
then
with
the
assistance
of
my
sons
drew
it
out
of
the
cave
which
was
too
dark
for
work
and
i
wished
to
secure
the
rich
and
beautiful
skins
which
might
be
useful
to
us
in
winter
we
set
to
work
and
as
the
animals
were
still
warm
we
succeeded
more
easily
than
i
could
have
expected
but
the
skins
were
so
heavy
it
was
almost
impossible
to
remove
them
we
therefore
left
them
in
the
cave
the
bottom
of
which
was
sandy
closing
the
entrance
with
boughs
that
no
animal
might
enter
to
devour
them
and
abandoned
the
two
bodies
only
regretting
the
abundance
of
fat
which
would
have
been
useful
for
many
domestic
purposes
chapter
xlv
we
resumed
our
search
thanking
god
for
our
preservation
from
this
danger
in
which
my
dear
jack
at
any
rate
might
have
perished
as
a
proof
and
trophy
of
our
adventure
we
cut
off
the
fore
paws
of
the
animal
to
carry
to
my
wife
it
is
said
that
these
form
a
very
delicious
dish
fit
for
the
table
of
a
king
the
valley
now
began
to
expand
and
presented
a
more
varied
appearance
it
was
intersected
with
beautiful
plains
or
savannas
of
which
the
grass
had
evidently
been
eaten
and
with
more
extensive
woods
through
which
we
had
great
difficulty
in
forcing
a
passage
so
thick
and
entangled
were
the
lianas
and
underwood
we
succeeded
in
passing
them
by
keeping
at
the
borders
where
we
also
felt
in
greater
safety
from
the
wild
beasts
and
reptiles
of
which
we
saw
many
species
that
had
their
abode
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
besides
the
fatigue
of
our
journey
we
were
tormented
with
thirst
never
having
seen
any
water
since
we
left
the
sea
the
soil
was
so
moist
that
i
was
of
opinion
we
might
have
found
water
by
digging
but
having
been
compelled
to
leave
our
spades
when
we
came
along
the
reef
we
had
no
tools
suitable
for
the
purpose
we
were
also
impatient
to
wash
ourselves
after
the
butchery
of
the
bears
when
to
our
great
satisfaction
we
heard
the
murmur
of
waters
which
i
concluded
was
the
river
jack
and
i
had
seen
in
our
former
expedition
he
had
frequently
inquired
about
it
and
we
had
foolishly
thought
it
had
extended
along
the
whole
valley
which
could
not
be
it
was
a
gentle
stream
gushing
from
a
perpendicular
rock
which
reminded
me
of
the
source
of
the
river
orbe
in
the
canton
of
vaud
it
issued
forth
in
its
full
width
rolling
at
first
over
a
rocky
bed
then
forming
a
graceful
bend
it
took
its
course
towards
the
great
bay
and
fell
in
a
cascade
into
the
sea
we
remained
some
time
here
to
fill
our
gourds
drinking
moderately
and
taking
a
bath
which
refreshed
us
all
greatly
the
evening
was
approaching
and
we
began
to
fear
we
should
not
reach
home
before
night
i
had
warned
my
wife
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
we
might
be
delayed
though
i
could
not
then
anticipate
the
cause
of
our
delay
we
endeavoured
however
by
walking
as
quickly
as
we
could
and
resting
no
more
to
reach
our
farm
at
any
rate
we
followed
the
course
of
the
river
on
the
opposite
shore
of
which
rose
a
wide
plain
where
we
saw
the
herd
of
buffaloes
quietly
grazing
ruminating
and
drinking
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
us
we
thought
we
distinguished
some
other
quadrupeds
amongst
them
which
fritz
was
certain
were
zebras
or
onagras
but
certainly
not
his
dear
gazelle
for
which
he
had
incessantly
looked
round
jack
was
in
despair
that
the
river
separated
us
from
the
buffaloes
so
that
he
could
not
cast
his
lasso
round
the
legs
of
one
of
them
as
he
had
promised
ernest
he
even
wished
to
swim
across
the
stream
to
have
a
hunt
but
i
forbade
him
encouraging
him
to
hope
that
perhaps
a
single
buffalo
might
cross
to
our
side
and
throw
itself
in
the
way
of
his
lasso
i
was
far
from
wishing
such
a
thing
myself
for
we
had
no
time
to
lose
nor
any
means
to
secure
and
lead
it
home
should
we
succeed
in
capturing
one
not
having
any
cords
with
us
and
moreover
intending
to
return
from
the
bay
in
the
canoe
when
we
arrived
at
the
bay
the
night
which
comes
on
rapidly
in
equinoctial
countries
had
almost
closed
we
were
scarcely
able
to
see
without
terror
the
changes
that
the
late
storm
had
occasioned
the
narrow
pass
which
led
from
the
other
side
of
the
island
between
the
river
and
a
deep
stream
that
flowed
from
the
rocks
was
entirely
obstructed
with
rocks
and
earth
fallen
upon
it
and
to
render
our
passage
practicable
it
was
necessary
to
undertake
a
labour
that
the
darkness
now
prevented
and
which
would
at
any
time
be
attended
by
danger
we
were
obliged
then
to
spend
the
night
in
the
open
air
and
separated
from
our
dear
and
anxious
friends
at
tent
house
fortunately
fritz
had
collected
a
store
of
for
his
mother
with
which
he
had
filled
his
own
pockets
and
those
of
his
brothers
these
with
water
from
the
river
formed
our
supper
for
we
had
nothing
but
the
bone
of
our
leg
of
mutton
left
we
turned
back
a
little
way
to
establish
ourselves
under
a
clump
of
trees
where
we
were
in
greater
safety
we
loaded
our
muskets
we
kindled
a
large
fire
of
dry
branches
and
recommending
ourselves
to
the
protection
of
god
we
lay
ourselves
down
on
the
soft
moss
to
wait
for
the
first
rays
of
light
with
the
exception
of
jack
who
from
the
first
slept
as
if
he
had
been
in
his
bed
we
none
of
us
could
rest
the
night
was
beautiful
a
multitude
of
stars
shone
over
our
heads
in
the
ethereal
vault
ernest
was
never
tired
of
gazing
on
them
after
some
questions
and
suppositions
on
the
plurality
of
worlds
their
courses
and
their
distances
he
quitted
us
to
wander
on
the
borders
of
the
river
which
reflected
them
in
all
their
brilliancy
from
this
night
his
passion
for
astronomy
commenced
a
passion
which
he
carried
beyond
all
others
this
became
his
favourite
and
continual
study
nor
did
he
fall
far
short
of
duval
whose
history
he
had
read
whilst
he
was
engaged
in
contemplation
fritz
and
i
conversed
on
our
projects
for
tunnelling
to
the
grotto
and
on
the
utility
of
such
a
passage
as
this
side
of
the
island
was
quite
lost
to
us
from
the
difficulty
in
reaching
it
and
yet
said
i
it
is
to
this
difficulty
we
owe
the
safety
we
have
enjoyed
who
can
say
that
the
bears
and
the
buffaloes
may
not
find
the
way
through
the
grotto
i
confess
i
am
not
desirous
of
their
visits
nor
even
of
those
of
the
onagras
who
knows
but
they
might
persuade
your
favourite
lightfoot
to
return
and
live
amongst
them
liberty
has
many
charms
till
now
we
have
been
very
happy
on
our
side
of
the
island
without
the
productions
of
this
my
dear
boy
there
is
a
proverb
alone
let
us
not
have
too
much
ambition
it
has
ruined
greater
states
than
ours
fritz
seemed
grieved
to
give
up
his
plan
and
suggested
that
he
could
forge
some
strong
bars
of
iron
to
place
before
the
opening
which
could
be
removed
at
will
but
said
i
they
will
not
prevent
the
snakes
from
passing
underneath
i
have
noticed
some
with
terror
as
they
are
animals
i
have
a
great
antipathy
to
and
if
your
mother
saw
one
crawl
into
her
grotto
she
would
never
enter
it
again
even
if
she
did
not
die
of
fright
well
we
must
give
it
up
said
fritz
but
it
is
a
pity
do
you
think
father
there
are
more
bears
in
the
island
than
those
we
killed
in
all
probability
said
i
it
is
scarcely
to
be
supposed
that
there
should
only
be
two
i
can
not
well
account
for
their
being
here
they
can
swim
very
well
and
perhaps
the
abundance
of
fruit
in
this
part
of
the
island
may
have
attracted
them
i
then
gave
my
son
a
short
account
of
their
manners
and
habits
from
the
best
works
on
the
history
of
these
animals
chapter
xlvi
whilst
we
continued
to
talk
and
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
stars
they
at
length
began
to
fade
away
before
the
first
light
of
morning
ernest
returned
to
us
and
we
awoke
jack
who
had
slept
uninterruptedly
and
was
quite
unconscious
where
he
was
we
returned
to
the
pass
which
now
by
the
light
of
day
seemed
to
us
in
a
more
hopeless
state
than
in
the
dusk
of
evening
i
was
struck
with
consternation
it
appeared
to
me
that
we
were
entirely
enclosed
at
this
side
and
i
shuddered
to
think
of
crossing
the
island
again
to
pass
round
at
the
other
end
of
the
risk
we
should
run
of
meeting
wild
beasts
and
of
the
painful
and
perilous
passage
along
the
coral
reefs
at
that
moment
i
would
gladly
have
consented
to
open
a
passage
through
the
grotto
at
the
hazard
of
any
visitors
in
order
to
get
through
myself
that
i
might
relieve
the
anxious
feelings
of
my
dear
wife
and
boy
the
thoughts
of
their
agony
unnerved
me
and
took
away
all
courage
for
the
commencement
of
a
labour
which
seemed
impossible
our
only
utensils
being
a
small
saw
and
a
little
dibble
for
taking
up
plants
which
ernest
had
been
unwilling
to
leave
behind
us
the
path
by
which
jack
and
i
had
passed
was
covered
with
rocks
and
masses
of
soil
which
obstructed
even
the
course
of
the
stream
we
could
not
discover
the
place
we
had
forded
the
river
had
opened
itself
a
wider
course
far
beyond
its
former
one
it
is
impossible
said
fritz
gazing
on
the
ruins
that
we
can
remove
all
these
immense
stones
without
proper
tools
but
perhaps
with
a
little
courage
we
may
cross
over
them
the
rivulet
being
widened
can
not
be
very
deep
at
all
events
it
can
not
be
worse
than
the
coral
reefs
let
us
try
but
i
fear
it
will
be
impossible
at
least
for
said
i
pointing
to
jack
indeed
papa
and
why
not
said
the
bold
fellow
is
perhaps
as
strong
and
more
active
than
some
of
ask
fritz
what
he
thinks
of
his
workman
shall
i
go
the
first
to
show
you
the
way
and
he
was
advancing
boldly
but
i
checked
him
and
said
that
before
we
undertook
to
scale
these
masses
of
rock
absolutely
bare
where
we
had
nothing
to
support
us
or
to
hold
by
it
would
be
as
well
to
examine
if
by
descending
lower
we
could
not
find
a
less
dangerous
road
we
descended
to
the
narrow
pass
and
found
our
drawbridge
plantation
all
our
fortification
that
my
boys
were
so
proud
of
and
where
at
request
i
had
even
planted
a
small
cannon
all
all
destroyed
the
cannon
swallowed
up
with
the
rest
my
boys
deplored
their
disappointment
but
i
showed
them
how
useless
such
a
defence
must
ever
be
nature
had
provided
us
with
a
better
fortification
than
we
could
construct
as
we
just
now
bitterly
experienced
we
had
descended
several
yards
lower
with
incredible
difficulty
plunged
in
a
wet
heavy
soil
and
obliged
to
step
across
immense
stones
when
fritz
who
went
first
cried
out
joyfully
the
roof
papa
the
roof
of
our
it
is
quite
whole
it
will
be
a
bridge
for
us
if
we
can
only
get
to
it
what
roof
what
chalet
said
i
in
astonishment
the
roof
of
our
little
hermitage
said
he
which
we
had
covered
so
well
with
stones
like
the
swiss
i
then
recollected
that
i
had
made
this
little
hut
after
the
fashion
of
the
swiss
chalet
of
bark
with
a
roof
nearly
flat
and
covered
with
stones
to
secure
it
against
the
winds
it
was
this
circumstance
and
its
situation
that
had
saved
it
in
the
storm
i
had
placed
it
opposite
the
cascade
that
we
might
see
the
fall
in
all
its
beauty
and
consequently
a
little
on
one
side
of
the
passage
filled
up
by
the
fall
of
the
rocks
some
fragments
reached
the
roof
of
the
hut
and
we
certainly
could
not
have
entered
it
but
the
chalet
was
supported
by
this
means
and
the
roof
was
still
standing
and
perfectly
secure
we
contrived
to
slide
along
the
rock
which
sustained
it
jack
was
the
first
to
stand
on
the
roof
and
sing
victory
it
was
very
easy
to
descend
on
the
other
side
holding
by
the
poles
and
pieces
of
bark
and
we
soon
found
ourselves
safe
in
our
island
ernest
had
lost
his
gun
in
the
passage
not
being
willing
to
resign
his
bag
of
curiosities
he
had
dropped
the
gun
into
the
abyss
you
may
take
the
gun
i
left
in
the
canoe
said
fritz
but
another
time
throw
away
your
stones
and
keep
your
gun
you
will
find
it
a
good
friend
in
need
let
us
embark
in
our
canoe
cried
jack
the
sea
the
sea
long
live
the
waves
they
are
not
so
hard
as
the
stones
i
was
very
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
conveying
my
canoe
back
to
the
port
of
tent
house
our
important
occupations
had
prevented
me
till
now
and
everything
favoured
the
plan
the
sea
was
calm
the
wind
favourable
and
we
should
arrive
at
home
sooner
and
with
less
fatigue
than
by
land
we
skirted
the
great
bay
to
the
wood
i
had
moored
the
canoe
so
firmly
to
one
of
the
palms
that
i
felt
secure
of
it
being
there
we
arrived
at
the
place
and
no
canoe
was
there
the
mark
of
the
cord
which
fastened
it
was
still
to
be
seen
round
the
tree
but
the
canoe
had
entirely
disappeared
struck
with
astonishment
we
looked
at
each
other
with
terror
and
without
being
able
to
articulate
a
word
what
was
become
of
it
some
animal
the
jackals
a
monkey
perhaps
might
have
detached
it
said
jack
but
they
could
not
have
eaten
the
canoe
and
we
could
not
find
a
trace
of
it
any
more
than
of
the
gun
fritz
had
left
in
it
this
extraordinary
circumstance
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
thought
savages
surely
had
landed
on
our
island
and
carried
off
our
canoe
we
could
no
longer
doubt
it
when
we
discovered
on
the
sands
the
print
of
naked
feet
it
is
easy
to
believe
how
uneasy
and
agitated
i
was
i
hastened
to
take
the
road
to
tent
house
from
which
we
were
now
more
than
three
leagues
distant
i
forbade
my
sons
to
mention
this
event
or
our
suspicions
to
their
mother
as
i
knew
it
would
rob
her
of
all
peace
of
mind
i
tried
to
console
myself
it
was
possible
that
chance
had
conducted
them
to
the
bay
that
they
had
seen
our
pretty
canoe
and
that
satisfied
with
their
prize
and
seeing
no
inhabitants
they
might
not
return
perhaps
on
the
contrary
these
islanders
might
prove
kind
and
humane
and
become
our
friends
there
was
no
trace
of
their
proceedings
further
than
the
shore
we
called
at
on
purpose
to
examine
all
appeared
in
order
and
certainly
if
they
had
reached
here
there
was
much
to
tempt
them
our
cotton
mattresses
our
osier
seats
and
some
household
utensils
that
my
wife
had
left
here
our
geese
and
fowls
did
not
appear
to
have
been
alarmed
but
were
pecking
about
as
usual
for
worms
and
insects
i
began
to
hope
that
we
might
get
off
with
the
loss
of
our
canoe
a
loss
which
might
be
repaired
we
were
a
sufficient
number
being
well
armed
not
to
be
afraid
of
a
few
savages
even
if
they
penetrated
further
into
the
island
and
showed
hostile
intentions
i
exhorted
my
sons
to
do
nothing
to
irritate
them
on
the
contrary
to
meet
them
with
kindness
and
attention
and
to
commit
no
violence
against
them
unless
called
on
to
defend
their
lives
i
also
recommended
them
to
select
from
the
wrecked
chest
some
articles
likely
to
please
the
savages
and
to
carry
them
always
about
with
them
and
i
beseech
you
once
more
added
i
not
to
alarm
your
mother
they
promised
me
and
we
continued
our
road
unmolested
to
falcon
nest
jack
preceded
us
delighted
he
said
to
see
our
castle
again
which
he
hoped
the
savages
had
not
carried
away
suddenly
we
saw
him
return
running
with
terror
painted
on
his
countenance
they
are
there
said
he
they
have
taken
possession
of
it
our
dwelling
is
full
of
them
oh
how
frightful
they
are
what
a
blessing
mamma
is
not
there
she
would
have
died
of
fright
to
see
them
enter
i
confess
i
was
much
agitated
but
not
wishing
to
expose
my
children
to
danger
before
i
had
done
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
it
i
ordered
them
to
remain
behind
till
i
called
them
i
broke
a
branch
from
a
tree
hastily
which
i
held
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
some
long
nails
which
i
found
by
chance
in
the
bottom
of
my
pocket
and
i
advanced
thus
to
my
i
expected
to
have
found
the
door
of
my
staircase
torn
open
and
broken
and
our
new
guests
ascending
and
descending
but
i
saw
at
once
it
was
closed
as
i
had
left
it
being
of
bark
it
was
not
easily
distinguished
how
had
these
savages
reached
the
dwelling
forty
feet
from
the
ground
i
had
placed
planks
before
the
great
opening
they
were
no
longer
there
the
greater
part
of
them
had
been
hurled
down
to
the
ground
and
i
heard
such
a
noise
in
our
house
that
i
could
not
doubt
jack
report
i
advanced
timidly
holding
up
in
the
air
the
branch
and
my
offerings
when
i
discovered
all
at
once
that
i
was
offering
them
to
a
troop
of
monkeys
lodged
in
the
fortress
which
they
were
amusing
themselves
by
destroying
we
had
numbers
of
them
in
the
island
some
large
and
mischievous
against
whom
we
had
some
difficulty
in
defending
ourselves
when
crossing
the
woods
where
they
principally
dwelt
the
frequent
report
of
round
our
dwelling
had
kept
them
aloof
till
now
when
emboldened
by
our
absence
and
enticed
by
the
figs
on
our
tree
they
had
come
in
crowds
these
vexatious
animals
had
got
through
the
roof
and
once
in
had
thrown
down
the
planks
that
covered
the
opening
they
made
the
most
frightful
grimaces
throwing
down
everything
they
could
seize
although
this
devastation
caused
me
much
vexation
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
their
antics
and
at
the
humble
and
submissive
manner
in
which
i
had
advanced
to
pay
homage
to
them
i
called
my
sons
who
laughed
heartily
and
rallied
prince
of
the
without
mercy
for
not
knowing
his
own
subjects
fritz
wished
much
to
discharge
his
gun
amongst
them
but
i
forbade
him
i
was
too
anxious
to
reach
tent
house
to
be
able
to
turn
my
thoughts
on
these
depredators
just
now
we
continued
our
journey
but
i
pause
here
my
heart
is
oppressed
my
feelings
when
i
reached
home
require
another
chapter
to
describe
them
and
i
must
summon
courage
for
the
task
chapter
xlvii
we
soon
arrived
at
family
bridge
where
i
had
some
hopes
of
meeting
francis
and
perhaps
his
mother
who
was
beginning
to
walk
very
well
but
i
was
disappointed
they
were
not
there
yet
i
was
not
uneasy
for
they
were
neither
certain
of
the
hour
of
our
return
nor
of
the
way
we
might
take
i
expected
however
to
find
them
in
the
colonnade
they
were
not
there
i
hastily
entered
the
house
i
called
aloud
elizabeth
francis
where
are
you
no
one
answered
a
mortal
terror
seized
me
and
for
a
moment
i
could
not
move
they
will
be
in
the
grotto
said
ernest
or
in
the
garden
said
fritz
perhaps
on
the
shore
cried
jack
my
mother
likes
to
watch
the
waves
and
francis
may
be
gathering
shells
these
were
possibilities
my
sons
flew
in
all
directions
in
search
of
their
mother
and
brother
i
found
it
impossible
to
move
and
was
obliged
to
sit
down
i
trembled
and
my
heart
beat
till
i
could
scarcely
breathe
i
did
not
venture
to
dwell
on
the
extent
of
my
fears
or
rather
i
had
no
distinct
notion
of
them
i
tried
to
recover
myself
i
murmured
yes
at
the
grotto
or
the
garden
they
will
return
directly
still
i
could
not
compose
myself
i
was
overwhelmed
with
a
sad
presentiment
of
the
misfortune
which
impended
over
me
it
was
but
too
soon
realized
my
sons
returned
in
fear
and
consternation
they
had
no
occasion
to
tell
me
the
result
of
their
search
i
saw
it
at
once
and
sinking
down
motionless
i
cried
alas
they
are
not
there
jack
returned
the
last
and
in
the
most
frightful
state
he
had
been
at
the
and
throwing
himself
into
my
arms
he
sobbed
out
the
savages
have
been
here
and
carried
away
my
mother
and
francis
perhaps
they
have
devoured
them
i
have
seen
the
marks
of
their
horrible
feet
on
the
sands
and
the
print
of
dear
francis
boots
this
account
at
once
recalled
me
to
strength
and
action
come
my
children
let
us
fly
to
save
them
god
will
pity
our
sorrow
and
assist
us
he
will
restore
them
come
come
they
were
ready
in
a
moment
but
a
distracting
thought
seized
me
had
they
carried
off
the
pinnace
if
so
every
hope
was
gone
jack
in
his
distress
had
never
thought
of
remarking
this
but
the
instant
i
named
it
fritz
and
he
ran
to
ascertain
the
important
circumstance
ernest
in
the
mean
time
supporting
me
and
endeavouring
to
calm
me
perhaps
said
he
they
are
still
in
the
island
perhaps
they
may
have
fled
to
hide
themselves
in
some
wood
or
amongst
the
reeds
even
if
the
pinnace
be
left
it
would
be
prudent
to
search
the
island
from
end
to
end
before
we
leave
it
trust
fritz
and
me
we
will
do
this
and
even
if
we
find
them
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
we
will
recover
them
whilst
we
are
off
on
this
expedition
you
can
be
preparing
for
our
voyage
and
we
will
search
the
world
from
one
end
to
the
other
every
country
and
every
sea
but
we
will
find
them
and
we
shall
succeed
let
us
put
our
whole
trust
in
god
he
is
our
father
he
will
not
try
us
beyond
our
strength
i
embraced
my
child
and
a
flood
of
tears
relieved
my
overcharged
heart
my
eyes
and
hands
were
raised
to
heaven
my
silent
prayers
winged
their
flight
to
the
almighty
to
him
who
tries
us
and
consoles
us
a
ray
of
hope
seemed
to
visit
my
mind
when
i
heard
my
boys
cry
out
as
they
approached
the
pinnace
is
here
they
have
not
carried
that
away
i
fervently
thanked
god
it
was
a
kind
of
miracle
for
this
pretty
vessel
was
more
tempting
than
the
canoe
perhaps
as
it
was
hidden
in
a
little
creek
between
the
rocks
it
had
escaped
their
observation
perhaps
they
might
not
know
how
to
manage
it
or
they
might
not
be
numerous
enough
no
matter
it
was
there
and
might
be
the
means
of
our
recovering
the
beloved
objects
those
barbarians
had
torn
from
us
how
gracious
is
god
to
give
us
hope
to
sustain
us
in
our
afflictions
without
hope
we
could
not
live
it
restores
and
revives
us
and
even
if
never
realized
below
accompanies
us
to
the
end
of
our
life
and
beyond
the
grave
i
imparted
to
my
eldest
son
the
idea
of
his
brother
that
they
might
be
concealed
in
some
part
of
the
island
but
i
dared
not
rely
on
this
sweet
hope
finally
as
we
ought
not
to
run
the
risk
of
abandoning
them
if
they
were
still
here
and
perhaps
in
the
power
of
the
savages
i
consented
that
my
two
eldest
sons
should
go
to
ascertain
the
fact
besides
however
impatient
i
was
i
felt
that
a
voyage
such
as
we
were
undertaking
into
unknown
seas
might
be
of
long
duration
and
it
was
necessary
to
make
some
preparations
i
must
think
on
food
water
arms
and
many
other
things
there
are
situations
in
life
which
seize
the
heart
and
soul
rendering
us
insensible
to
the
wants
of
the
body
this
we
now
experienced
we
had
just
come
from
a
painful
journey
on
foot
of
hours
during
which
we
had
had
little
rest
and
no
sleep
since
morning
we
had
eaten
nothing
but
some
morsels
of
the
it
was
natural
that
we
should
be
overcome
with
fatigue
and
hunger
but
we
none
of
us
had
even
thought
of
our
own
state
we
were
supported
if
i
may
use
the
expression
by
our
despair
at
the
moment
that
my
sons
were
going
to
set
out
the
remembrance
of
their
need
of
refreshment
suddenly
occurred
to
me
and
i
besought
them
to
rest
a
little
and
take
something
but
they
were
too
much
agitated
to
consent
i
gave
fritz
a
bottle
of
canary
and
some
slices
of
roast
mutton
i
met
with
which
he
put
in
his
pocket
they
had
each
a
loaded
musket
and
they
set
out
taking
the
road
along
the
rocks
where
the
most
hidden
retreats
and
most
impenetrable
woods
lay
they
promised
me
to
fire
off
their
pieces
frequently
to
let
their
mother
know
they
were
there
if
she
was
hidden
among
the
rocks
they
took
also
one
of
the
dogs
flora
we
could
not
find
which
made
us
conclude
she
had
followed
her
mistress
to
whom
she
was
much
attached
as
soon
as
my
eldest
sons
had
left
us
i
made
jack
conduct
me
to
the
shore
where
he
had
seen
the
footmarks
that
i
might
examine
them
to
judge
of
their
number
and
direction
i
found
many
very
distinct
but
so
mingled
i
could
come
to
no
positive
conclusion
some
were
near
the
sea
with
the
foot
pointing
to
the
shore
and
amongst
these
jack
thought
he
could
distinguish
the
of
francis
my
wife
wore
very
light
boots
also
which
i
had
made
for
her
they
rendered
stockings
unnecessary
and
strengthened
her
ankles
i
could
not
find
the
trace
of
these
but
i
soon
discovered
that
my
poor
elizabeth
had
been
here
from
a
piece
torn
from
an
apron
she
wore
made
of
her
own
cotton
and
dyed
red
i
had
now
not
the
least
doubt
that
she
was
in
the
canoe
with
her
son
it
was
a
sort
of
consolation
to
think
they
were
together
but
how
many
mortal
fears
accompanied
this
consolation
oh
was
i
ever
to
see
again
these
objects
of
my
tenderest
affection
certain
now
that
they
were
not
in
the
island
i
was
impatient
for
the
return
of
my
sons
and
i
made
every
preparation
for
our
departure
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
was
the
wrecked
chest
which
would
furnish
me
with
means
to
conciliate
the
savages
and
to
ransom
my
loved
ones
i
added
to
it
everything
likely
to
tempt
them
utensils
stuffs
trinkets
i
even
took
with
me
gold
and
silver
coin
which
was
thrown
on
one
side
as
useless
but
might
be
of
service
to
us
on
this
occasion
i
wished
my
riches
were
three
times
as
much
as
they
were
that
i
might
give
all
in
exchange
for
the
life
and
liberty
of
my
wife
and
son
i
then
turned
my
thoughts
on
those
remaining
to
me
i
took
in
bags
and
gourds
all
that
we
had
left
of
and
potatoes
a
barrel
of
two
bottles
of
rum
and
several
jars
of
fresh
water
jack
wept
as
he
filled
them
at
his
fountain
which
he
perhaps
might
never
see
again
any
more
than
his
dear
valiant
whom
i
set
at
liberty
as
well
as
the
cow
ass
buffalo
and
the
beautiful
onagra
these
docile
animals
were
accustomed
to
us
and
our
attentions
and
they
remained
in
their
places
surprised
that
they
were
neither
harnessed
nor
mounted
we
opened
the
and
the
flamingo
would
not
leave
us
it
went
and
came
with
us
from
the
house
to
the
pinnace
we
took
also
oil
candles
fuel
and
a
large
iron
pot
to
cook
our
provisions
in
for
our
defence
i
took
two
more
guns
and
a
small
barrel
of
powder
all
we
had
left
i
added
besides
some
changes
of
linen
not
forgetting
some
for
my
dear
wife
which
i
hoped
might
be
needed
the
time
fled
rapidly
while
we
were
thus
employed
night
came
on
and
my
sons
returned
not
my
grief
was
inconceivable
the
island
was
so
large
and
woody
that
they
might
have
lost
themselves
or
the
savages
might
have
returned
and
encountered
them
after
twenty
hours
of
frightful
terror
i
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
alas
only
report
it
was
the
signal
agreed
on
if
they
returned
alone
if
they
brought
their
mother
if
francis
also
accompanied
them
but
i
expected
they
would
return
alone
and
i
was
still
grateful
i
ran
to
meet
them
they
were
overcome
with
fatigue
and
vexation
they
begged
to
set
out
immediately
not
to
lose
one
precious
moment
they
were
now
sure
the
island
did
not
contain
those
they
lamented
and
they
hoped
i
would
not
return
without
discovering
them
for
what
would
the
island
be
to
us
without
our
loved
ones
fritz
at
that
moment
saw
his
dear
lightfoot
capering
round
him
and
could
not
help
sighing
as
he
caressed
him
and
took
leave
of
him
may
i
find
thee
here
said
he
where
i
leave
thee
in
such
sorrow
and
i
will
bring
back
thy
young
master
added
he
turning
to
the
bull
who
was
also
approaching
him
he
then
begged
me
again
to
set
out
as
the
moon
was
just
rising
in
all
her
majesty
the
queen
of
night
said
ernest
will
guide
us
to
the
queen
of
our
island
who
is
perhaps
now
looking
up
to
her
and
calling
on
us
to
help
her
most
assuredly
said
i
she
is
thinking
on
us
but
it
is
on
god
she
is
calling
for
help
let
us
join
her
in
prayer
my
dear
children
for
herself
and
our
dear
francis
they
fell
on
their
knees
with
me
and
i
uttered
the
most
fervent
and
earnest
prayer
that
ever
human
heart
poured
forth
and
i
rose
with
confidence
that
our
prayers
were
heard
i
proceeded
with
new
courage
to
the
creek
that
contained
our
pinnace
where
jack
arranged
all
we
had
brought
we
rowed
out
of
the
creek
and
when
we
were
in
the
bay
we
held
a
council
to
consider
on
which
side
we
were
to
commence
our
search
i
thought
of
returning
to
the
great
bay
from
whence
our
canoe
had
been
taken
my
sons
on
the
contrary
thought
that
these
islanders
content
with
their
acquisition
had
been
returning
homewards
coasting
along
the
island
when
an
unhappy
chance
had
led
their
mother
and
brother
to
the
shore
where
the
savages
had
seen
them
and
carried
them
off
at
the
most
they
could
but
be
a
day
before
us
but
that
was
long
enough
to
fill
us
with
dreadful
anticipations
i
yielded
to
the
opinion
of
my
sons
which
had
a
great
deal
of
reason
on
its
side
besides
the
wind
was
favourable
in
that
direction
and
abandoning
ourselves
in
full
confidence
to
almighty
god
we
spread
our
sails
and
were
soon
in
the
open
sea
chapter
xlviii
a
gentle
wind
swelled
our
sails
and
the
current
carried
us
rapidly
into
the
open
sea
i
then
seated
myself
at
the
helm
and
employed
the
little
knowledge
i
had
gained
during
our
voyage
from
europe
in
directing
our
bark
so
that
we
might
avoid
the
rocks
and
coral
banks
that
surrounded
our
island
my
two
oldest
sons
overcome
with
fatigue
had
no
sooner
seated
themselves
on
a
bench
than
they
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
notwithstanding
their
sorrows
jack
held
out
the
best
his
love
of
the
sea
kept
him
awake
and
i
surrendered
the
helm
to
him
till
i
took
a
momentary
slumber
my
head
resting
against
the
stern
a
happy
dream
placed
me
in
the
midst
of
my
family
in
our
dear
island
but
a
shout
from
ernest
awoke
me
he
was
calling
on
jack
to
leave
the
helm
as
he
was
contriving
to
run
the
vessel
among
the
breakers
on
the
coast
i
seized
the
helm
and
soon
set
all
right
determined
not
to
trust
my
giddy
son
again
jack
of
all
my
sons
was
the
one
who
evinced
most
taste
for
the
sea
but
being
so
young
when
we
made
our
voyage
his
knowledge
of
nautical
affairs
was
very
scanty
my
elder
sons
had
learnt
more
ernest
who
had
a
great
thirst
for
knowledge
of
every
kind
had
questioned
the
pilot
on
all
he
had
seen
him
do
he
had
learned
a
great
deal
in
theory
but
of
practical
knowledge
he
had
none
the
mechanical
genius
of
fritz
had
drawn
conclusions
from
what
he
saw
this
would
have
induced
me
to
place
much
trust
in
him
in
case
of
that
danger
which
i
prayed
heaven
might
be
averted
what
a
situation
was
mine
for
a
father
wandering
through
unknown
and
dangerous
seas
with
my
three
sons
my
only
hope
in
search
of
a
fourth
and
of
my
beloved
helpmate
utterly
ignorant
which
way
we
should
direct
our
course
or
where
to
find
a
trace
of
those
we
sought
how
often
do
we
allay
the
happiness
granted
us
below
by
vain
wishes
i
had
at
one
time
regretted
that
we
had
no
means
of
leaving
our
island
now
we
had
left
it
and
our
sole
wish
was
to
recover
those
we
had
lost
to
bring
them
back
to
it
and
never
to
leave
it
more
i
sometimes
regretted
that
i
had
led
my
sons
into
this
danger
i
might
have
ventured
alone
but
i
reflected
that
i
could
not
have
left
them
for
fritz
had
said
if
the
savages
had
carried
off
the
pinnace
i
would
have
swum
from
isle
to
isle
till
i
had
found
them
my
boys
all
endeavoured
to
encourage
and
console
me
fritz
placed
himself
at
the
rudder
observing
that
the
pinnace
was
new
and
well
built
and
likely
to
resist
a
tempest
ernest
stood
on
the
deck
silently
watching
the
stars
only
breaking
his
silence
by
telling
me
he
should
be
able
by
them
to
supply
the
want
of
the
compass
and
point
out
how
we
should
direct
our
course
jack
climbed
dexterously
up
the
mast
to
let
me
see
his
skill
we
called
him
the
fritz
was
the
pilot
ernest
the
astronomer
and
i
was
the
captain
and
commander
of
the
expedition
daybreak
showed
us
we
had
passed
far
from
our
island
which
now
only
appeared
a
dark
speck
i
as
well
as
fritz
and
jack
was
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
go
round
it
and
try
our
fortune
on
the
opposite
coast
but
ernest
who
had
not
forgotten
his
telescope
was
certain
he
saw
land
in
a
direction
he
pointed
out
to
us
we
took
the
glass
and
were
soon
convinced
he
was
right
as
day
advanced
we
saw
the
land
plainly
and
did
not
hesitate
to
sail
towards
it
as
this
appeared
the
land
nearest
to
our
island
we
supposed
the
savages
might
have
conveyed
their
captives
there
but
more
trials
awaited
us
before
we
arrived
there
it
being
necessary
to
shift
the
sail
in
order
to
reach
the
coast
in
view
my
poor
jack
ran
up
the
mast
holding
by
the
ropes
but
before
he
reached
the
sail
the
rope
which
he
held
broke
suddenly
he
was
precipitated
into
the
sea
and
disappeared
in
a
moment
but
he
soon
rose
to
the
surface
trying
to
swim
and
mingling
his
cries
with
ours
fritz
who
was
the
first
to
see
the
accident
was
in
the
water
almost
as
soon
as
jack
and
seizing
him
by
the
hair
swam
with
the
other
hand
calling
on
him
to
try
and
keep
afloat
and
hold
by
him
when
i
saw
my
two
sons
thus
struggling
with
the
waves
that
were
very
strong
from
a
land
wind
i
should
in
my
despair
have
leaped
in
after
them
but
ernest
held
me
and
implored
me
to
remain
to
assist
in
getting
them
into
the
pinnace
he
had
thrown
ropes
to
them
and
a
bench
which
he
had
torn
up
with
the
strength
of
despair
fritz
had
contrived
to
catch
one
of
the
ropes
and
fasten
it
round
jack
who
still
swam
but
feebly
as
if
nearly
exhausted
fritz
had
been
considered
an
excellent
swimmer
in
switzerland
he
preserved
all
his
presence
of
mind
calling
to
us
to
draw
the
rope
gently
while
he
supported
the
poor
boy
and
pushed
him
towards
the
pinnace
at
last
i
was
able
to
reach
and
draw
him
up
and
when
i
saw
him
extended
nearly
lifeless
at
the
bottom
of
the
pinnace
i
fell
down
senseless
beside
him
how
precious
to
us
now
was
the
composed
mind
of
ernest
in
the
midst
of
such
a
scene
he
was
calm
and
collected
promptly
disengaging
the
rope
from
the
body
of
jack
he
flung
it
back
to
fritz
to
help
him
in
reaching
the
pinnace
attaching
the
other
end
firmly
to
the
mast
this
done
quicker
than
i
can
write
it
he
approached
us
raised
his
brother
so
that
he
might
relieve
himself
from
the
quantity
of
water
he
had
swallowed
then
turning
to
me
restored
me
to
my
senses
by
administering
to
me
some
drops
of
rum
and
by
saying
courage
father
you
have
saved
jack
and
i
will
save
fritz
he
has
hold
of
the
rope
he
is
swimming
strongly
he
is
coming
he
is
here
he
left
me
to
assist
his
brother
who
was
soon
in
the
vessel
and
in
my
arms
jack
perfectly
recovered
joined
him
and
fervently
did
i
thank
god
for
granting
me
in
the
midst
of
my
trials
such
a
moment
of
happiness
we
could
not
help
fancying
this
happy
preservation
was
an
augury
of
our
success
in
our
anxious
search
and
that
we
should
bring
back
the
lost
ones
to
our
island
oh
how
terrified
mamma
would
have
been
said
jack
to
see
me
sink
i
thought
i
was
going
like
a
stone
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
i
pushed
out
my
arms
and
legs
with
all
my
strength
and
up
i
rose
he
as
well
as
fritz
was
quite
wet
i
had
by
chance
brought
some
changes
of
clothes
which
i
made
them
put
on
after
giving
each
a
little
rum
they
were
so
much
fatigued
and
i
was
so
overcome
by
my
agitation
that
we
were
obliged
to
relinquish
rowing
most
unwillingly
as
the
skies
threatened
a
storm
we
gradually
began
to
distinguish
clearly
the
island
we
wished
to
approach
and
the
which
came
to
rest
on
our
sails
gave
us
hopes
that
we
should
reach
it
before
night
but
suddenly
such
a
thick
fog
arose
that
it
hid
every
object
from
us
even
the
sea
itself
and
we
seemed
to
be
sailing
among
the
clouds
i
thought
it
prudent
to
drop
our
anchor
as
fortunately
we
had
a
tolerably
strong
one
but
there
appeared
so
little
water
that
i
feared
we
were
near
the
breakers
and
i
watched
anxiously
for
the
fog
to
dissipate
and
permit
us
to
see
the
coast
it
finally
changed
into
a
heavy
rain
which
we
could
with
difficulty
protect
ourselves
from
there
was
however
a
to
the
pinnace
under
which
we
crept
and
sheltered
ourselves
here
crowded
close
together
we
talked
over
the
late
accident
fritz
assured
me
he
was
never
in
any
danger
and
that
he
would
plunge
again
into
the
sea
that
moment
if
he
had
the
least
hope
that
it
would
lead
him
to
find
his
mother
and
francis
we
all
said
the
same
though
jack
confessed
that
his
friends
the
waves
had
not
received
his
visit
very
politely
but
had
even
beat
him
very
rudely
but
i
would
bear
twice
as
much
said
he
to
see
mamma
and
dear
francis
again
do
you
think
papa
that
the
savages
could
ever
hurt
them
mamma
is
so
good
and
francis
is
so
pretty
and
then
poor
mamma
is
so
lame
yet
i
hope
they
would
pity
her
and
carry
her
alas
i
could
not
hope
as
my
boy
did
i
feared
that
they
would
force
her
to
walk
i
tried
to
conceal
other
horrible
fears
that
almost
threw
me
into
despair
i
recalled
all
the
cruelties
of
the
cannibal
nations
and
shuddered
to
think
that
my
elizabeth
and
my
darling
child
were
perhaps
in
their
ferocious
hands
prayer
and
confidence
in
god
were
the
only
means
not
to
console
but
to
support
me
and
teach
me
to
endure
my
heavy
affliction
with
resignation
i
looked
on
my
three
sons
and
endeavoured
for
their
sakes
to
hope
and
submit
the
darkness
rapidly
increased
till
it
became
total
we
concluded
it
was
night
the
rain
having
ceased
i
went
out
to
strike
a
light
as
i
wished
to
hang
the
lighted
lantern
to
the
mast
when
ernest
who
was
on
deck
called
out
loudly
father
brothers
come
the
sea
is
on
fire
and
indeed
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
surface
of
the
water
appeared
in
flames
this
light
of
the
most
brilliant
fiery
red
reached
even
to
the
vessel
and
we
were
surrounded
by
it
it
was
a
sight
at
once
beautiful
and
almost
terrific
jack
seriously
inquired
if
there
was
not
a
volcano
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
i
astonished
him
much
by
telling
him
that
this
light
was
caused
by
a
kind
of
marine
animals
which
in
form
resembled
plants
so
much
that
they
were
formerly
considered
such
but
naturalists
and
modern
voyagers
have
entirely
destroyed
this
error
and
furnished
proofs
that
they
are
organized
beings
having
all
the
spontaneous
movements
peculiar
to
animals
they
feel
when
they
are
touched
seek
for
food
seize
and
devour
it
they
are
of
various
kinds
and
colours
and
are
known
under
the
general
name
of
zoophytes
and
this
which
glitters
in
such
beautiful
colours
on
the
sea
is
called
said
ernest
see
here
are
some
i
have
caught
in
my
hat
you
may
see
them
move
how
they
change
colour
orange
green
blue
like
the
rainbow
and
when
you
touch
them
the
flame
appears
still
more
brilliant
now
they
are
pale
yellow
they
amused
themselves
some
time
with
these
bright
and
beautiful
creatures
which
appear
to
have
but
a
they
occupied
a
large
space
on
the
water
and
their
astonishing
radiance
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
of
the
atmosphere
had
such
a
striking
and
magnificent
effect
that
for
a
few
moments
we
were
diverted
from
our
own
sad
thoughts
but
an
observation
from
jack
soon
recalled
them
if
francis
passed
this
way
said
he
how
he
would
be
amused
with
these
funny
creatures
which
look
like
fire
but
do
not
burn
but
i
know
he
would
be
afraid
to
touch
them
and
how
much
afraid
mamma
would
be
as
she
likes
no
animals
she
does
not
know
ah
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
tell
her
all
about
our
voyage
and
my
excursion
into
the
sea
and
how
fritz
dragged
me
by
the
hair
and
what
they
call
these
fiery
fishes
tell
me
again
ernest
py
py
pyrosoma
peron
calls
them
said
ernest
the
description
of
them
is
very
interesting
in
his
voyage
which
i
have
read
to
mamma
and
as
she
would
recollect
it
she
would
not
be
afraid
i
pray
to
god
replied
i
that
she
may
have
nothing
more
to
fear
than
the
pyrosoma
and
that
we
may
soon
see
them
again
with
her
and
francis
we
all
said
amen
and
the
day
breaking
we
decided
to
weigh
the
anchor
and
endeavour
to
find
a
passage
through
the
reefs
to
reach
the
island
which
we
now
distinctly
saw
and
which
seemed
an
uncultivated
and
rocky
coast
i
resumed
my
place
at
the
helm
my
sons
took
the
oars
and
we
advanced
cautiously
sounding
every
minute
what
would
have
become
of
us
if
our
pinnace
had
been
injured
the
sea
was
perfectly
calm
and
after
prayer
to
god
and
a
slight
refreshment
we
proceeded
forward
looking
carefully
round
for
any
canoe
of
the
savages
it
might
be
even
our
own
but
no
we
were
not
fortunate
enough
to
discover
any
trace
of
our
beloved
friends
nor
any
symptom
of
the
isle
being
inhabited
however
as
it
was
our
only
point
of
hope
we
did
not
wish
to
abandon
it
by
dint
of
searching
we
found
a
small
bay
which
reminded
us
of
our
own
it
was
formed
by
a
river
broad
and
deep
enough
for
our
pinnace
to
enter
we
rowed
in
and
having
placed
our
vessel
in
a
creek
where
it
appeared
to
be
secure
we
began
to
consider
the
means
of
exploring
the
whole
island
chapter
xlix
i
did
not
disembark
on
this
unknown
shore
without
great
emotion
it
might
be
inhabited
by
a
barbarous
and
cruel
race
and
i
almost
doubted
the
prudence
of
thus
risking
my
three
remaining
children
in
the
hazardous
and
uncertain
search
after
our
dear
lost
ones
i
think
i
could
have
borne
my
bereavement
with
christian
resignation
if
i
had
seen
my
wife
and
child
die
in
my
arms
i
should
then
have
been
certain
they
were
happy
in
the
bosom
of
their
god
but
to
think
of
them
in
the
power
of
ferocious
and
idolatrous
savages
who
might
subject
them
to
cruel
tortures
and
death
chilled
my
very
blood
i
demanded
of
my
sons
if
they
felt
courage
to
pursue
the
difficult
and
perilous
enterprise
we
had
commenced
they
all
declared
they
would
rather
die
than
not
find
their
mother
and
brother
fritz
even
besought
me
with
ernest
and
jack
to
return
to
the
island
in
case
the
wanderers
should
come
back
and
be
terrified
to
find
it
deserted
and
to
leave
him
the
arms
and
the
means
of
trafficking
with
the
savages
without
any
uneasiness
about
his
prudence
and
discretion
i
assured
him
i
did
not
distrust
his
courage
and
prudence
but
i
showed
him
the
futility
of
hoping
that
the
savages
would
voluntarily
carry
back
their
victims
or
that
they
could
escape
alone
and
should
he
meet
with
them
here
and
succeed
how
could
he
carry
his
recovered
treasures
to
the
island
no
my
children
said
i
we
will
all
search
in
the
confidence
that
god
will
bless
our
efforts
and
perhaps
sooner
than
we
think
said
ernest
perhaps
they
are
in
this
island
jack
was
running
off
immediately
to
search
but
i
called
my
little
madcap
back
till
we
arranged
our
plans
i
advised
that
two
of
us
should
remain
to
watch
the
coast
while
the
other
two
penetrated
into
the
interior
the
first
thing
necessary
to
ascertain
was
if
the
island
was
inhabited
which
might
easily
be
done
by
climbing
some
tree
that
overlooked
the
country
and
remarking
if
there
were
any
traces
of
the
natives
any
huts
or
fires
lighted
those
who
made
any
discovery
were
immediately
to
inform
the
rest
that
we
might
go
in
a
body
to
recover
our
own
if
nothing
announced
that
the
island
was
inhabited
we
were
to
leave
it
immediately
to
search
elsewhere
all
wished
to
be
of
the
party
of
discovery
at
length
ernest
agreed
to
remain
with
me
and
watch
for
any
arrivals
by
sea
before
we
parted
we
all
knelt
to
invoke
the
blessing
of
god
on
our
endeavours
fritz
and
jack
as
the
most
active
were
to
visit
the
interior
of
the
island
and
to
return
with
information
as
soon
as
possible
to
be
prepared
for
any
chance
i
gave
them
a
filled
with
toys
trinkets
and
pieces
of
money
to
please
the
savages
i
also
made
them
take
some
food
fritz
took
his
gun
after
promising
me
he
would
not
fire
it
except
to
defend
his
life
lest
he
should
alarm
the
savages
and
induce
them
to
remove
their
captives
jack
took
his
lasso
and
they
set
out
with
our
benedictions
accompanied
by
the
brave
turk
on
whom
i
depended
much
to
discover
his
mistress
and
his
companion
flora
if
she
was
still
with
her
friends
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
ernest
and
i
set
to
work
to
conceal
as
much
as
possible
our
pinnace
from
discovery
we
lowered
the
masts
and
hid
with
great
care
under
the
deck
the
precious
chest
with
our
treasure
provisions
and
powder
we
got
our
pinnace
with
great
difficulty
the
water
being
low
behind
a
rock
which
completely
concealed
it
on
the
but
it
was
still
visible
from
the
sea
ernest
suggested
that
we
should
entirely
cover
it
with
branches
of
trees
so
that
it
might
appear
like
a
heap
of
bushes
and
we
began
to
cut
them
immediately
with
two
hatchets
we
found
in
the
chest
and
which
we
speedily
fitted
with
handles
we
found
also
a
large
iron
staple
which
ernest
succeeded
with
a
hammer
and
pieces
of
wood
in
fixing
in
the
rock
to
moor
the
pinnace
to
we
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
branches
within
our
reach
there
were
many
trees
on
the
shore
but
their
trunks
were
bare
we
found
at
last
at
some
distance
an
extensive
thicket
composed
of
a
beautiful
shrub
which
ernest
recognized
to
be
a
species
of
mimosa
the
trunk
of
this
plant
is
knotty
and
stunted
about
three
or
four
feet
high
and
spreads
its
branches
horizontally
clothed
with
beautiful
foliage
and
so
thickly
interwoven
that
the
little
quadrupeds
who
make
their
dwellings
in
these
thickets
are
obliged
to
open
covered
roads
out
of
the
entangled
mass
of
vegetation
at
the
first
blow
of
the
hatchet
a
number
of
beautiful
little
creatures
poured
forth
on
all
sides
they
resembled
the
kangaroos
of
our
island
but
were
smaller
more
elegant
and
remarkable
for
the
beauty
of
their
skin
which
was
striped
like
that
of
the
zebra
it
is
the
striped
kangaroo
cried
ernest
described
in
the
voyages
of
peron
how
i
long
to
have
one
the
female
should
have
a
pouch
to
contain
her
young
ones
he
lay
down
very
still
at
the
entrance
of
the
thicket
and
soon
had
the
satisfaction
of
seizing
two
which
leaped
out
almost
into
his
arms
this
animal
is
timid
as
the
hare
of
our
country
they
endeavoured
to
escape
but
ernest
held
them
fast
one
was
a
female
which
had
her
young
one
in
her
pouch
which
my
son
took
out
very
cautiously
it
was
an
elegant
little
creature
with
a
skin
like
its
mother
only
more
brilliant
it
was
full
of
graceful
antics
the
poor
mother
no
longer
wished
to
escape
all
her
desire
seemed
to
be
to
recover
her
offspring
and
to
replace
it
in
its
nest
at
last
she
succeeded
in
seizing
and
placing
it
carefully
in
security
then
her
desire
to
escape
was
so
strong
that
ernest
could
scarcely
hold
her
he
wished
much
to
keep
and
tame
her
and
asked
my
permission
to
empty
one
of
the
chests
for
a
dwelling
for
her
and
to
carry
her
off
in
the
pinnace
but
i
refused
him
decidedly
i
explained
to
him
the
uncertainty
of
our
return
to
the
island
and
the
imprudence
of
adding
to
our
cares
and
certainly
added
i
you
would
not
wish
this
poor
mother
to
perish
from
famine
and
confinement
when
your
own
mother
is
herself
a
prisoner
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
he
declared
he
would
not
be
such
a
savage
as
to
keep
a
poor
mother
in
captivity
go
pretty
creature
said
he
releasing
her
and
may
my
mother
be
as
fortunate
as
you
she
soon
profited
by
his
permission
and
skipped
off
with
her
treasure
we
continued
to
cut
down
the
branches
of
the
mimosa
but
they
were
so
entangled
and
the
foliage
so
light
that
we
agreed
to
extend
our
search
for
some
thicker
branches
as
we
left
the
shore
the
country
appeared
more
fertile
we
found
many
unknown
trees
which
bore
no
fruit
but
some
covered
with
delicious
flowers
ernest
was
in
his
element
he
wanted
to
collect
and
examine
all
to
endeavour
to
discover
their
names
either
from
analogy
to
other
plants
or
from
descriptions
he
had
read
he
thought
he
recognized
the
several
kinds
of
and
the
virginian
pine
which
has
the
largest
and
thickest
branches
we
loaded
ourselves
with
as
much
as
we
could
carry
and
in
two
or
three
journeys
we
had
collected
sufficient
to
cover
the
vessel
and
to
make
a
shelter
for
ourselves
if
we
were
obliged
to
pass
the
night
on
shore
i
had
given
orders
to
my
sons
that
both
were
to
return
before
night
at
all
events
and
if
the
least
hope
appeared
one
was
to
run
with
all
speed
to
tell
us
all
my
fear
was
that
they
might
lose
their
way
in
this
unknown
country
they
might
meet
with
lakes
marshes
or
perplexing
forests
every
moment
i
was
alarmed
with
the
idea
of
some
new
danger
and
never
did
any
day
seem
so
long
ernest
endeavoured
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
comfort
and
encourage
me
but
the
buoyancy
of
spirit
peculiar
to
youth
prevented
him
dwelling
long
on
one
painful
thought
he
amused
his
mind
by
turning
to
search
for
the
marine
productions
with
which
the
rocks
were
covered
mosses
of
the
most
brilliant
colours
zoophytes
of
various
kinds
occupied
his
attention
he
brought
them
to
me
regretting
that
he
could
not
preserve
them
oh
if
my
dear
mother
could
see
them
said
he
or
if
fritz
could
paint
them
how
they
would
amuse
francis
this
recalled
our
sorrows
and
my
uneasiness
increased
chapter
all
was
so
still
around
us
and
our
pinnace
was
so
completely
hidden
with
its
canopy
of
verdure
that
i
could
not
help
regretting
that
i
had
not
accompanied
my
sons
it
was
now
too
late
but
my
steps
involuntarily
turned
to
the
road
i
had
seen
them
take
ernest
remaining
on
the
rocks
in
search
of
natural
curiosities
but
i
was
suddenly
recalled
by
a
cry
from
ernest
father
a
canoe
a
canoe
alas
is
it
not
ours
i
said
rushing
to
the
shore
where
indeed
i
saw
beyond
the
reefs
a
canoe
floating
lightly
apparently
filled
with
the
islanders
easy
to
distinguish
from
their
dark
complexion
this
canoe
did
not
resemble
ours
it
was
longer
narrower
and
seemed
to
be
composed
of
long
strips
of
bark
quite
rough
tied
together
at
each
end
which
gave
somewhat
of
a
graceful
form
to
it
though
it
evidently
belonged
to
the
infancy
of
the
art
of
navigation
it
is
almost
inconceivable
how
these
frail
barks
resist
the
slightest
storm
but
these
islanders
swim
so
well
that
even
if
the
canoe
fills
they
jump
out
empty
it
and
take
their
places
again
when
landed
one
or
two
men
take
up
the
canoe
and
carry
it
to
their
habitation
this
however
appeared
to
be
provided
with
to
preserve
the
equilibrium
and
six
savages
with
a
sort
of
oars
made
it
fly
like
the
wind
when
it
passed
the
part
of
the
island
where
we
were
we
hailed
it
as
loudly
as
we
could
the
savages
answered
by
frightful
cries
but
showed
no
intention
of
approaching
us
or
entering
the
bay
on
the
contrary
they
went
on
with
great
rapidity
continuing
their
cries
i
followed
them
with
my
eyes
as
far
as
i
could
in
speechless
emotion
for
either
my
fancy
deceived
me
or
i
faintly
distinguished
a
form
of
fairer
complexion
than
the
beings
who
surrounded
him
features
or
dress
i
could
not
see
on
the
whole
it
was
a
vague
impression
that
i
trembled
alike
to
believe
or
to
doubt
ernest
more
active
than
i
had
climbed
a
and
with
his
telescope
had
commanded
a
better
view
of
the
canoe
he
watched
it
round
a
point
of
land
and
then
came
down
almost
as
much
agitated
as
myself
i
ran
to
him
and
said
ernest
was
it
your
mother
no
papa
i
am
certain
it
was
not
my
mother
said
he
neither
was
it
francis
here
he
was
silent
a
cold
shuddering
came
over
me
why
are
you
silent
said
i
what
do
you
think
indeed
papa
i
could
distinguish
nothing
said
he
even
with
the
telescope
they
passed
so
quickly
would
that
it
were
my
mother
and
brother
we
should
then
be
sure
they
were
living
and
might
follow
them
but
a
thought
strikes
me
let
us
free
the
pinnace
and
sail
after
the
canoe
we
can
go
quicker
than
they
with
the
sail
we
shall
overtake
them
behind
the
cape
and
then
we
shall
at
least
be
satisfied
i
hesitated
lest
my
sons
should
come
back
but
ernest
represented
to
me
that
we
were
only
fulfilling
the
wishes
of
fritz
besides
we
should
return
in
a
short
time
he
added
that
he
would
soon
disencumber
the
pinnace
soon
cried
i
when
we
have
been
at
least
two
hours
in
covering
it
yes
said
he
but
we
had
a
dozen
journeys
to
make
to
the
trees
then
i
will
have
it
ready
in
less
than
half
an
hour
i
assisted
him
as
actively
as
i
could
though
not
with
good
heart
for
i
was
uneasy
about
abandoning
my
sons
i
would
have
given
worlds
to
see
them
arrive
before
our
departure
to
have
their
assistance
which
was
of
much
consequence
in
the
pinnace
and
to
know
they
were
safe
i
often
left
off
my
work
to
take
a
glance
into
the
interior
of
the
island
hoping
to
see
them
frequently
i
mistook
the
trees
in
the
twilight
which
was
now
coming
on
for
moving
objects
at
last
i
was
not
deceived
i
saw
distinctly
a
figure
walking
rapidly
they
are
here
i
cried
running
forward
followed
by
ernest
and
we
soon
saw
a
figure
approaching
i
concluded
it
was
a
savage
and
though
disappointed
was
not
alarmed
as
he
was
alone
i
stopped
and
begged
ernest
to
recollect
all
the
words
he
had
met
with
in
his
books
of
the
language
of
the
savages
the
black
man
approached
and
conceive
my
surprise
when
i
heard
him
cry
in
my
own
language
do
be
alarmed
father
it
is
i
your
son
fritz
is
it
possible
said
i
can
i
believe
it
and
jack
what
have
you
done
with
my
jack
where
is
he
speak
ernest
did
not
ask
alas
he
knew
too
well
he
had
seen
with
his
telescope
that
it
was
his
dear
brother
jack
that
was
in
the
canoe
with
the
savages
but
he
had
not
dared
to
tell
me
i
was
in
agony
fritz
harassed
with
fatigue
and
overwhelmed
with
grief
sunk
down
on
the
ground
oh
father
said
he
sobbing
i
dread
to
appear
before
you
without
my
brother
i
have
lost
him
can
you
ever
forgive
your
unfortunate
fritz
oh
yes
yes
we
are
all
equally
unfortunate
cried
i
sinking
down
beside
my
son
while
ernest
seated
himself
on
the
other
side
to
support
me
i
then
besought
fritz
to
tell
me
if
the
savages
had
murdered
my
dear
boy
he
assured
me
that
he
was
not
killed
but
carried
off
by
the
savages
still
he
hoped
he
was
safe
ernest
then
told
me
he
had
seen
him
seated
in
the
canoe
apparently
without
clothes
but
not
stained
black
as
fritz
was
i
earnestly
wish
he
had
been
said
fritz
to
that
i
attribute
my
escape
but
i
am
truly
thankful
to
god
that
you
have
seen
him
ernest
which
way
have
the
monsters
gone
ernest
pointed
out
the
cape
and
fritz
was
anxious
that
we
should
embark
without
delay
and
endeavour
to
snatch
him
from
them
and
have
you
learned
nothing
of
your
mother
and
francis
said
i
alas
nothing
said
he
though
i
think
i
recognized
a
handkerchief
belonging
to
dear
mamma
on
the
head
of
a
savage
i
will
tell
you
all
my
adventure
as
we
go
you
forgive
me
dear
father
yes
my
dear
son
said
i
i
forgive
and
pity
you
but
are
you
sure
my
wife
and
francis
are
not
on
the
island
quite
sure
said
he
in
fact
the
island
is
entirely
uninhabited
there
is
no
fresh
water
nor
game
and
no
quadrupeds
whatever
but
rats
and
kangaroos
but
plenty
of
fruit
i
have
filled
my
bag
with
which
is
all
we
shall
need
let
us
go
we
worked
so
hard
that
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
branches
were
removed
and
the
pinnace
ready
to
receive
us
the
wind
was
favourable
for
carrying
us
towards
the
cape
the
savages
had
turned
we
hoisted
our
sail
i
took
my
place
at
the
helm
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
moon
lighted
our
way
after
recommending
ourselves
to
the
protection
of
god
i
desired
fritz
to
commence
his
melancholy
recital
it
will
be
melancholy
indeed
said
the
poor
boy
weeping
if
we
do
not
find
my
dear
jack
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
not
having
stained
his
skin
before
my
own
then
he
should
have
been
with
you
now
but
i
have
you
my
dear
son
to
console
your
father
said
i
i
can
do
nothing
myself
in
my
sorrow
i
depend
on
you
my
two
eldest
to
restore
to
me
what
i
have
lost
go
on
fritz
we
went
on
continued
he
with
courage
and
hope
and
as
we
proceeded
we
felt
that
you
were
right
in
saying
we
ought
not
to
judge
of
the
island
by
the
borders
you
can
form
no
idea
of
the
fertility
of
the
island
or
of
the
beauty
of
the
trees
and
shrubs
we
met
with
at
every
step
quite
unknown
to
me
some
were
covered
with
fragrant
flowers
others
with
tempting
fruits
which
however
we
did
not
venture
to
taste
as
we
had
not
knips
to
try
them
did
you
see
any
monkeys
asked
ernest
not
one
replied
his
brother
to
the
great
vexation
of
jack
but
we
saw
parrots
and
all
sorts
of
birds
of
the
most
splendid
plumage
whilst
we
were
remarking
these
creatures
i
did
not
neglect
to
look
carefully
about
for
any
trace
that
might
aid
our
search
i
saw
no
hut
no
sort
of
dwelling
nor
anything
that
could
indicate
that
the
island
was
inhabited
and
not
the
slightest
appearance
of
fresh
water
and
we
should
have
been
tormented
with
thirst
if
we
had
not
found
some
containing
milk
and
an
acid
fruit
full
of
juice
which
we
have
in
our
own
island
ernest
calls
it
the
we
quenched
our
thirst
with
this
as
well
as
with
the
plant
which
we
also
have
and
which
contains
water
in
the
stem
the
country
is
flat
and
open
and
its
beautiful
trees
stand
at
such
a
distance
from
each
other
that
no
one
could
hide
amongst
them
but
if
we
found
no
dwellings
we
often
discovered
traces
of
the
savages
extinguished
fires
remains
of
kangaroos
and
of
fish
shells
and
even
entire
nuts
which
we
secured
for
ourselves
we
remarked
also
footmarks
on
the
sand
we
both
wished
anxiously
to
meet
with
a
savage
that
we
might
endeavour
to
make
him
comprehend
by
signs
whom
we
were
in
search
of
hoping
that
natural
affection
might
have
some
influence
even
with
these
untaught
creatures
i
was
only
fearful
that
my
dress
and
the
colour
of
my
skin
might
terrify
them
in
the
mean
time
jack
with
his
usual
rashness
had
climbed
to
the
summit
of
one
of
the
tallest
trees
and
suddenly
cried
out
prepare
your
signs
the
savages
are
landing
oh
what
black
ugly
creatures
they
are
and
nearly
naked
you
ought
to
dress
yourself
like
them
to
make
friends
with
them
you
can
stain
your
skin
with
these
throwing
me
down
branches
of
a
sort
of
fruit
of
a
dark
purple
colour
large
as
a
plum
with
a
skin
like
the
mulberry
have
been
tasting
them
they
are
very
nauseous
and
they
have
stained
my
fingers
black
rub
yourself
well
with
the
juice
of
this
fruit
and
you
will
be
a
perfect
savage
i
agreed
immediately
he
descended
from
the
tree
while
i
undressed
and
with
his
assistance
i
stained
myself
from
head
to
foot
as
you
see
me
but
do
be
alarmed
a
single
dip
in
the
sea
will
make
me
a
european
again
the
jack
then
helped
to
dress
me
in
a
sort
of
tunic
made
of
large
leaves
and
laughed
heartily
when
he
looked
at
me
calling
me
of
whom
he
had
seen
a
picture
which
he
declared
i
exactly
resembled
i
then
wished
to
disguise
him
in
the
same
way
but
he
would
not
consent
he
declared
that
when
he
met
with
mamma
and
francis
he
should
fly
to
embrace
them
and
that
he
should
alarm
and
disgust
them
in
such
a
costume
he
said
i
could
protect
him
if
the
savages
wished
to
devour
him
they
were
now
at
hand
and
we
went
forward
jack
following
me
with
my
bundle
of
clothes
under
his
arm
i
had
slung
my
bag
of
powder
and
provision
on
my
shoulders
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
most
of
the
savages
wore
the
skin
of
that
animal
for
the
most
part
spread
out
like
a
mantle
over
their
shoulders
few
of
them
had
other
clothes
excepting
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
chief
and
had
a
tunic
of
green
rushes
neatly
woven
i
tried
to
recollect
all
the
words
of
savage
language
i
could
but
very
few
occurred
to
me
i
said
at
first
i
do
know
whether
they
comprehended
me
but
they
paid
me
great
attention
evidently
taking
me
for
a
savage
only
one
of
them
wished
to
seize
my
gun
but
i
held
it
firmly
and
on
the
chief
speaking
a
word
to
him
he
drew
back
they
spoke
very
rapidly
and
i
saw
by
their
looks
they
spoke
about
us
they
looked
incessantly
at
jack
repeating
maiti
jack
imitated
all
their
motions
and
made
some
grimaces
which
seemed
to
amuse
them
i
tried
in
vain
to
attract
their
attention
i
had
observed
a
handkerchief
twisted
round
the
head
of
him
who
seemed
the
chief
that
reminded
me
much
of
the
one
my
mother
usually
wore
i
approached
him
touched
the
handkerchief
saying
expressively
aîné
mère
et
tata
i
added
pointing
to
the
sea
but
alas
they
did
not
appear
to
understand
my
words
the
chief
thought
i
wished
to
rob
him
of
his
handkerchief
and
repelled
me
roughly
i
then
wished
to
retire
and
i
told
jack
to
follow
me
but
four
islanders
seized
him
opened
his
waistcoat
and
shirt
and
cried
out
together
téa
in
an
instant
he
was
stripped
and
his
clothes
and
mine
were
put
on
in
a
strange
fashion
by
the
savages
jack
mimicking
all
their
contortions
recovered
his
shirt
from
one
of
them
put
it
on
and
began
to
dance
calling
on
me
to
do
the
same
and
in
a
tone
as
if
singing
repeated
your
escape
fritz
while
i
am
amusing
them
i
will
then
run
off
and
join
you
very
soon
as
if
i
could
for
a
moment
think
of
leaving
him
in
the
hands
of
these
barbarians
however
i
recollected
at
that
moment
the
bag
you
had
given
me
of
toys
and
trinkets
we
had
thoughtlessly
left
it
under
the
great
tree
where
i
had
undressed
i
told
jack
in
the
same
tone
i
would
fetch
it
if
he
could
amuse
the
savages
till
i
returned
which
he
might
be
certain
would
be
very
soon
i
ran
off
with
all
speed
and
without
opposition
arrived
at
the
tree
found
my
bag
well
guarded
indeed
father
for
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
our
two
faithful
dogs
turk
and
flora
sitting
over
it
flora
cried
i
she
accompanied
my
dear
wife
and
child
into
their
captivity
they
must
be
in
this
island
why
have
we
left
it
my
dear
father
continued
fritz
depend
on
it
they
are
not
there
but
i
feel
convinced
that
the
wretches
who
have
carried
off
jack
hold
dear
mamma
and
francis
in
captivity
therefore
we
must
at
all
events
pursue
them
the
meeting
between
flora
and
me
was
truly
joyful
for
i
was
now
convinced
that
my
mother
and
francis
were
not
far
off
though
certainly
not
on
the
same
island
or
their
attached
friend
would
not
have
quitted
them
i
concluded
that
the
chief
who
had
taken
my
handkerchief
had
also
taken
her
dog
and
brought
her
on
this
excursion
and
that
she
had
here
met
with
her
friend
turk
who
had
rambled
from
us
after
caressing
flora
and
taking
up
my
bag
i
ran
off
full
speed
to
the
spot
where
my
dear
jack
was
trying
to
divert
the
barbarians
as
i
approached
i
heard
cries
not
the
noisy
laughter
of
the
savages
but
cries
of
distress
from
my
beloved
brother
cries
for
help
addressed
to
me
i
did
not
walk
i
flew
till
i
reached
the
spot
and
i
then
saw
him
bound
with
a
sort
of
strong
cord
made
of
gut
his
hands
were
fastened
behind
his
back
his
legs
tied
together
and
these
cruel
men
were
carrying
him
towards
their
canoe
while
he
was
crying
out
fritz
where
are
you
i
threw
myself
desperately
on
the
six
men
who
were
bearing
him
off
in
the
struggle
my
gun
which
i
held
in
my
hand
caught
something
and
accidentally
went
off
and
o
father
it
was
my
own
dear
jack
that
i
wounded
i
can
not
tell
how
i
survived
his
cry
of
have
killed
me
and
when
i
saw
his
blood
flow
my
senses
forsook
me
and
i
fainted
when
i
recovered
i
was
alone
they
had
carried
him
off
i
rose
and
following
the
traces
of
his
blood
arrived
fortunately
at
the
shore
just
as
they
were
embarking
god
permitted
me
to
see
him
again
supported
by
one
of
the
savages
and
even
to
hear
his
feeble
voice
cry
yourself
fritz
i
am
not
dead
i
am
only
wounded
in
the
shoulder
it
is
not
your
fault
go
my
kind
brother
as
quick
as
possible
to
papa
and
you
will
both
the
canoe
sailed
away
so
swiftly
that
i
heard
no
more
but
i
understood
the
rest
will
both
come
and
rescue
but
will
there
be
time
will
they
dress
his
wound
oh
father
what
have
i
done
can
you
forgive
me
overwhelmed
with
grief
i
could
only
hold
out
my
hand
to
my
poor
boy
and
assure
him
i
could
not
possibly
blame
him
for
this
distressing
accident
ernest
though
greatly
afflicted
endeavoured
to
console
his
brother
he
told
him
a
wound
in
the
shoulder
was
not
dangerous
and
the
savages
certainly
intended
to
dress
his
wound
or
they
would
have
left
him
to
die
fritz
somewhat
comforted
begged
me
to
allow
him
to
bathe
to
divest
himself
of
the
colouring
which
was
now
become
odious
to
him
as
being
that
of
these
ruthless
barbarians
i
was
reluctant
to
consent
i
thought
it
might
still
be
useful
in
gaining
access
to
the
savages
but
he
was
certain
they
would
recognize
him
in
that
disguise
as
the
bearer
of
and
would
distrust
him
i
now
recollected
to
ask
what
had
become
of
his
gun
and
was
sorry
to
learn
that
they
had
carried
it
off
whilst
he
lay
insensible
he
himself
considered
that
it
would
be
useless
to
them
as
they
had
fortunately
left
him
the
bag
of
ammunition
ernest
however
regretted
the
loss
to
ourselves
this
being
the
third
we
had
lost
the
one
we
had
left
in
the
canoe
being
also
in
the
possession
of
the
savages
the
dogs
we
missed
too
and
fritz
could
give
no
account
of
them
we
concluded
they
had
either
followed
the
savages
or
were
still
in
the
island
this
was
another
severe
sorrow
it
seemed
as
if
every
sort
of
misfortune
was
poured
out
upon
us
i
rested
on
the
shoulder
of
ernest
in
my
anguish
fritz
took
advantage
of
my
silence
and
leaped
out
of
the
pinnace
to
have
a
bath
i
was
alarmed
at
first
but
he
was
such
an
excellent
swimmer
and
the
sea
was
so
calm
that
i
soon
abandoned
my
fears
for
him
chapter
li
fritz
was
now
swimming
far
before
us
and
appeared
to
have
no
idea
of
turning
so
that
i
was
at
once
certain
he
projected
swimming
on
to
the
point
where
we
had
lost
sight
of
the
savages
to
be
the
first
to
discover
and
aid
his
brother
although
he
was
an
excellent
swimmer
yet
the
distance
was
so
great
that
i
was
much
alarmed
and
especially
for
his
arrival
by
night
in
the
midst
of
the
savages
this
fear
was
much
increased
by
a
very
extraordinary
sound
which
we
now
heard
gradually
approaching
us
it
was
a
sort
of
submarine
tempest
the
weather
was
beautiful
there
was
no
wind
the
moon
shone
in
a
cloudless
sky
yet
the
waves
were
swoln
as
if
by
a
storm
and
threatened
to
swallow
us
we
heard
at
the
same
time
a
noise
like
violent
rain
terrified
at
these
phenomena
i
cried
out
aloud
for
fritz
to
return
and
though
it
was
almost
impossible
my
voice
could
reach
him
we
saw
him
swimming
towards
us
with
all
his
strength
ernest
and
i
used
all
our
power
in
rowing
to
meet
him
so
that
we
soon
got
to
him
the
moment
he
leaped
in
he
uttered
in
a
stifled
voice
pointing
to
the
mountains
of
waves
they
are
enormous
marine
monsters
whales
i
believe
such
an
immense
shoal
they
will
swallow
us
up
no
said
ernest
quietly
do
be
alarmed
the
whale
is
a
gentle
and
harmless
animal
when
not
attacked
i
am
very
glad
to
see
them
so
near
we
shall
pass
as
quietly
through
the
midst
of
these
colossal
creatures
as
we
did
through
the
shining
zoophytes
doubtless
the
whales
are
searching
for
them
for
they
constitute
a
principal
article
of
their
food
they
were
now
very
near
us
sporting
on
the
surface
of
the
water
or
plunging
into
its
abysses
and
forcing
out
columns
of
water
through
their
nostrils
to
a
great
height
which
occasionally
fell
on
us
and
wetted
us
sometimes
they
raised
themselves
on
their
huge
tail
and
looked
like
giants
ready
to
fall
on
us
and
crush
us
then
they
went
down
again
into
the
water
which
foamed
under
their
immense
weight
then
they
seemed
to
be
going
through
some
military
evolutions
advancing
in
a
single
line
like
a
body
of
regular
troops
one
after
another
swimming
with
grave
dignity
still
more
frequently
they
were
in
lines
of
two
and
two
this
wonderful
sight
partly
diverted
us
from
our
own
melancholy
thoughts
fritz
had
however
seized
his
oar
without
giving
himself
time
to
dress
whilst
i
at
the
rudder
steered
as
well
as
i
could
through
these
monsters
who
are
notwithstanding
their
appearance
the
mildest
animals
that
exist
they
allowed
us
to
pass
so
closely
that
we
were
wetted
with
the
water
they
spouted
up
and
might
have
touched
them
and
with
the
power
to
overturn
us
with
a
stroke
of
their
tail
they
never
noticed
us
they
seemed
to
be
satisfied
with
each
other
society
we
were
truly
sorry
to
see
their
mortal
enemy
appear
amongst
them
the
of
the
south
armed
with
its
long
saw
remarkable
for
a
sort
of
of
nine
or
ten
inches
long
which
distinguishes
it
from
the
of
the
north
they
are
both
terrible
enemies
to
the
whale
and
next
to
man
who
wages
an
eternal
war
with
them
its
most
formidable
foes
the
whales
in
our
south
seas
had
only
the
to
dread
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
approach
they
dispersed
or
dived
into
the
depths
of
the
ocean
one
only
very
near
us
did
not
succeed
in
escaping
and
we
witnessed
a
combat
of
which
however
we
could
not
see
the
event
these
two
monsters
attacked
each
other
with
equal
ferocity
but
as
they
took
an
opposite
direction
to
that
we
were
going
we
soon
lost
sight
of
them
but
we
shall
never
forget
our
meeting
with
these
wonderful
giants
of
the
deep
we
happily
doubled
the
promontory
behind
which
the
canoe
had
passed
and
found
ourselves
in
an
extensive
gulf
which
narrowed
as
it
entered
the
land
and
resembled
the
mouth
of
a
river
we
did
not
hesitate
to
follow
its
course
we
went
round
the
bay
but
found
no
traces
of
man
but
numerous
herds
of
the
amphibious
animal
called
sometimes
the
the
or
the
or
trunked
phoca
modern
voyagers
give
it
the
last
name
these
animals
though
of
enormous
size
are
gentle
and
peaceful
unless
roused
by
the
cruelty
of
man
they
were
in
such
numbers
on
this
desert
coast
that
they
would
have
prevented
our
approach
if
we
had
intended
it
they
actually
covered
the
beach
and
the
rocks
opening
their
huge
mouths
armed
with
very
sharp
teeth
more
frightful
than
dangerous
as
it
was
night
when
we
entered
the
bay
they
were
all
sleeping
but
they
produced
a
most
deafening
noise
with
their
breathing
we
left
them
to
their
noisy
slumber
for
us
alas
no
such
comfort
remained
the
continual
anxiety
attending
an
affliction
like
ours
destroys
all
repose
and
for
three
days
we
had
not
slept
an
hour
since
the
new
misfortune
of
jack
captivity
we
were
all
kept
up
by
a
kind
of
fever
fritz
was
in
a
most
incredible
state
of
excitement
and
declared
he
would
never
sleep
till
he
had
rescued
his
beloved
brother
his
bath
had
partially
removed
the
colouring
from
his
skin
but
he
was
still
dark
enough
to
pass
for
a
savage
when
arrayed
like
them
the
shores
of
the
strait
we
were
navigating
were
very
steep
and
we
had
yet
not
met
with
any
place
where
we
could
land
however
my
sons
persisted
in
thinking
the
savages
could
have
taken
no
other
route
as
they
had
lost
sight
of
their
canoe
round
the
promontory
as
the
strait
was
narrow
and
shallow
i
consented
that
fritz
should
throw
off
the
clothes
he
had
on
and
swim
to
reconnoitre
a
place
which
seemed
to
be
an
opening
in
the
rocks
or
hills
that
obstructed
our
passage
and
we
soon
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
standing
on
the
shore
motioning
for
us
to
approach
the
strait
was
now
so
confined
that
we
could
not
have
proceeded
any
further
with
the
pinnace
we
could
not
even
bring
it
to
the
shore
ernest
and
i
were
obliged
to
step
into
the
water
up
to
the
waist
but
we
took
the
precaution
to
tie
a
long
and
strong
rope
to
the
prow
and
when
we
were
aided
by
the
vigorous
arm
of
fritz
we
soon
drew
the
pinnace
near
enough
to
fix
it
by
means
of
the
anchor
there
were
neither
trees
nor
rocks
on
that
desert
shore
to
which
we
could
fasten
the
pinnace
but
to
our
great
delight
and
encouragement
we
found
at
a
short
distance
from
our
a
bark
canoe
which
my
sons
were
certain
was
that
in
which
jack
had
been
carried
off
we
entered
it
but
at
first
saw
only
the
oars
at
last
however
ernest
discovered
in
the
water
which
half
filled
the
canoe
part
of
a
handkerchief
stained
with
blood
which
they
recognized
as
belonging
to
jack
this
discovery
which
relieved
our
doubts
caused
fritz
to
shed
tears
of
joy
we
were
certainly
on
the
track
of
the
robbers
and
might
trust
that
they
had
not
proceeded
farther
with
their
barbarity
we
found
on
the
sand
and
in
the
boat
some
shells
and
which
satisfied
us
of
the
nature
of
their
repasts
we
resolved
to
continue
our
search
into
the
interior
of
the
country
following
the
traces
of
the
steps
of
the
savages
we
could
not
find
any
traces
of
jack
foot
which
would
have
alarmed
us
if
fritz
had
not
suggested
that
they
had
carried
him
on
account
of
his
wound
we
were
about
to
set
out
when
the
thoughts
of
the
pinnace
came
over
us
it
was
more
than
ever
necessary
for
us
to
preserve
this
our
only
means
of
return
and
which
moreover
contained
our
goods
for
ransom
our
ammunition
and
our
provisions
still
untouched
for
some
fritz
had
gathered
some
muscles
and
small
but
excellent
oysters
had
been
sufficient
for
us
it
was
fortunate
that
we
had
brought
some
gourds
of
water
with
us
for
we
had
not
met
with
any
we
decided
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
leave
one
of
our
party
to
guard
the
precious
pinnace
though
this
would
be
but
an
insufficient
and
dangerous
defence
in
case
of
the
approach
of
the
natives
my
recent
bereavements
made
me
tremble
at
the
idea
of
leaving
either
of
my
sons
i
can
not
yet
reflect
on
the
agony
of
that
moment
without
horror
yet
it
was
the
sole
means
to
secure
our
vessel
there
was
not
a
creek
or
a
tree
to
hide
it
and
the
situation
of
the
canoe
made
it
certain
the
savages
must
return
there
to
embark
my
children
knew
my
thoughts
by
the
distracted
glances
with
which
i
alternately
regarded
them
and
the
pinnace
and
after
consulting
each
other
looks
ernest
said
the
pinnace
must
not
remain
here
unguarded
father
to
be
taken
or
at
any
rate
pillaged
by
the
natives
who
will
return
for
their
canoe
either
we
must
all
wait
till
they
come
or
you
must
leave
me
to
defend
it
i
see
fritz
that
you
could
not
endure
to
remain
here
in
fact
fritz
impatiently
stamped
with
his
foot
saying
i
confess
i
can
not
remain
here
jack
may
be
dying
of
his
wound
and
every
moment
is
precious
i
will
seek
him
find
him
and
save
him
i
have
a
presentiment
i
shall
and
if
i
discover
him
as
i
expect
in
the
hands
of
the
savages
i
know
the
way
to
release
him
and
to
prevent
them
carrying
off
our
pinnace
i
saw
that
the
daring
youth
in
the
heat
of
his
exasperation
exposed
alone
to
the
horde
of
barbarians
might
also
become
their
victim
i
saw
that
my
presence
was
necessary
to
restrain
and
aid
him
and
i
decided
with
a
heavy
heart
to
leave
ernest
alone
to
protect
the
vessel
his
calm
and
cool
manner
made
it
less
dangerous
for
him
to
meet
the
natives
he
knew
several
words
of
their
language
and
had
read
of
the
mode
of
addressing
and
conciliating
them
he
promised
me
to
be
prudent
which
his
elder
brother
could
not
be
we
took
the
bag
of
toys
which
fritz
had
brought
and
left
those
in
the
chest
to
use
if
necessary
and
praying
for
the
blessing
of
heaven
on
my
son
we
left
him
my
sorrow
was
great
but
he
was
no
longer
a
child
and
his
character
encouraged
me
fritz
embraced
his
brother
and
promised
him
to
bring
jack
back
in
safety
chapter
lii
after
having
traversed
for
some
time
a
desert
sandy
plain
without
meeting
a
living
creature
we
arrived
at
a
thick
wood
where
we
lost
the
traces
we
had
carefully
followed
we
were
obliged
to
direct
our
course
by
chance
keeping
no
fixed
road
but
advancing
as
the
interwoven
branches
permitted
us
the
wood
was
alive
with
the
most
beautiful
birds
of
brilliant
and
varied
plumage
but
in
our
anxious
and
distressed
state
we
should
have
been
more
interested
in
seeing
a
savage
than
a
bird
we
passed
at
last
through
these
verdant
groves
and
reached
an
arid
plain
extending
to
the
shore
we
again
discovered
numerous
footsteps
and
whilst
we
were
observing
them
we
saw
a
large
canoe
pass
rapidly
filled
with
islanders
and
this
time
i
thought
that
in
spite
of
the
distance
i
could
recognize
the
canoe
we
had
built
and
which
they
had
robbed
us
of
fritz
wished
to
swim
after
them
and
was
beginning
to
undress
himself
and
i
only
stopped
him
by
declaring
that
if
he
did
i
must
follow
him
as
i
had
decided
not
to
be
separated
from
him
i
even
proposed
that
we
should
return
to
ernest
as
i
was
of
opinion
that
the
savages
would
stop
at
the
place
where
we
had
disembarked
to
take
away
the
boat
they
had
left
and
we
might
then
by
means
of
the
words
ernest
had
acquired
learn
from
them
what
had
become
of
my
wife
and
children
fritz
agreed
to
this
though
he
still
persisted
that
the
easiest
and
quickest
mode
of
return
would
have
been
by
swimming
we
were
endeavouring
to
retrace
our
road
when
to
our
great
astonishment
we
saw
at
a
few
yards
distance
a
man
clothed
in
a
long
black
robe
advancing
towards
us
whom
we
immediately
recognized
as
a
european
either
i
am
greatly
deceived
said
i
or
this
is
a
missionary
a
worthy
servant
of
god
come
into
these
remote
regions
to
make
him
known
to
the
wretched
idolators
we
hastened
to
him
i
was
not
wrong
he
was
one
of
those
zealous
and
courageous
christians
who
devote
their
energies
and
their
lives
to
the
instruction
and
eternal
salvation
of
men
born
in
another
hemisphere
of
another
colour
uncivilized
but
not
less
our
brothers
i
had
quitted
europe
with
the
same
intention
but
providence
had
ordered
it
otherwise
yet
i
met
with
joy
one
of
my
christian
brethren
and
unable
to
speak
from
emotion
i
silently
embraced
him
he
spoke
to
me
in
english
a
language
i
had
fortunately
learned
myself
and
taught
to
my
children
and
his
words
fell
on
my
soul
like
the
message
of
the
angel
to
abraham
commanding
him
to
spare
his
son
you
are
the
person
i
am
seeking
said
he
in
a
mild
and
tender
tone
and
i
thank
heaven
that
i
have
met
with
you
this
youth
is
fritz
your
eldest
son
i
conclude
but
where
have
you
left
your
second
son
ernest
reverend
man
cried
fritz
seizing
his
hands
you
have
seen
my
brother
jack
perhaps
my
mother
you
know
where
they
are
oh
are
they
living
yes
they
are
living
and
well
taken
care
of
said
the
missionary
come
and
i
will
lead
you
to
them
it
was
indeed
necessary
to
lead
me
i
was
so
overcome
with
joy
that
i
should
have
fainted
but
the
good
missionary
made
me
inhale
some
volatile
salts
which
he
had
about
him
and
supported
by
him
and
my
son
i
managed
to
walk
my
first
words
were
a
thanksgiving
to
god
for
his
mercy
then
i
implored
my
good
friend
to
tell
me
if
i
should
indeed
see
my
wife
and
children
again
he
assured
me
that
an
hour
walk
would
bring
me
to
them
but
i
suddenly
recollected
ernest
and
refused
to
present
myself
before
the
beloved
ones
while
he
was
still
in
danger
the
missionary
smiled
as
he
told
me
he
expected
this
delay
and
wished
to
know
where
we
had
left
ernest
i
recounted
to
him
our
arrival
in
the
island
and
the
purpose
for
which
we
had
left
ernest
with
our
intention
of
returning
to
him
as
soon
as
we
saw
the
canoe
pass
hoping
to
obtain
some
intelligence
from
the
savages
but
how
could
you
have
made
yourselves
understood
said
he
are
you
acquainted
with
their
language
i
told
him
ernest
had
studied
the
vocabulary
of
the
south
sea
islanders
doubtless
that
of
tahiti
or
the
friendly
islands
said
he
but
the
dialect
of
these
islanders
differs
much
from
theirs
i
have
resided
here
more
than
a
year
and
have
studied
it
so
may
be
of
use
to
you
let
us
go
which
way
did
you
come
through
that
thick
wood
replied
i
where
we
wandered
a
long
time
and
i
fear
we
shall
have
some
difficulty
in
finding
our
way
back
you
should
have
taken
the
precaution
to
notch
the
trees
as
you
came
said
our
worthy
friend
without
that
precaution
you
were
in
danger
of
being
lost
but
we
will
find
my
marks
which
will
lead
us
to
the
brook
and
following
its
course
we
shall
be
safe
we
saw
no
brook
remarked
fritz
there
is
a
brook
of
excellent
water
which
you
have
missed
in
crossing
the
forest
if
you
had
ascended
the
course
of
the
stream
you
would
have
reached
the
hut
which
contains
your
dear
friends
the
brook
runs
before
it
fritz
struck
his
forehead
with
vexation
god
orders
all
for
the
best
said
i
to
the
good
priest
we
might
not
have
met
with
you
we
should
have
been
without
ernest
you
might
have
sought
us
all
day
in
vain
ah
good
man
it
is
under
your
holy
auspices
that
our
family
ought
to
meet
in
order
to
increase
our
happiness
now
please
to
tell
me
but
first
interrupted
fritz
pray
tell
me
how
jack
is
he
was
wounded
and
be
composed
young
man
said
the
calm
man
of
god
the
wound
which
he
confesses
he
owes
to
his
own
imprudence
will
have
no
evil
consequences
the
savages
had
applied
some
healing
herbs
to
it
but
it
was
necessary
to
extract
a
small
ball
an
operation
which
i
performed
yesterday
evening
since
then
he
suffers
less
and
will
be
soon
well
when
his
anxiety
about
you
is
relieved
fritz
embraced
the
kind
missionary
entreating
his
pardon
for
his
rashness
and
adding
did
my
brother
talk
to
you
of
us
sir
he
did
answered
his
friend
but
i
was
acquainted
with
you
before
your
mother
talked
continually
of
her
husband
and
children
what
mingled
pain
and
delight
she
felt
yesterday
evening
when
the
savages
brought
to
her
dear
jack
wounded
i
was
fortunately
in
the
hut
to
comfort
her
and
assist
her
beloved
boy
and
dear
francis
said
i
how
rejoiced
he
would
be
to
see
his
brother
again
francis
said
the
missionary
smiling
will
be
the
protector
of
you
all
he
is
the
idol
of
the
savages
now
an
idolatry
permitted
by
christianity
we
proceeded
through
the
wood
as
we
conversed
and
at
last
reached
the
brook
i
had
a
thousand
questions
to
ask
and
was
very
anxious
to
know
how
my
wife
and
francis
had
been
brought
to
this
island
and
how
they
met
with
the
missionary
the
five
or
six
days
we
had
been
separated
seemed
to
me
five
or
six
months
we
walked
too
quickly
for
me
to
get
much
information
the
english
minister
said
little
and
referred
me
to
my
wife
and
son
for
all
details
on
the
subject
of
his
own
noble
mission
he
was
less
reserved
thank
god
said
he
i
have
already
succeeded
in
giving
this
people
some
notions
of
humanity
they
love
their
as
they
call
me
and
willingly
listen
to
my
preaching
and
the
singing
of
some
hymns
when
your
little
francis
was
taken
he
had
his
reed
flageolet
in
his
pocket
and
his
playing
and
graceful
manners
have
so
captivated
them
that
i
fear
they
will
with
reluctance
resign
him
the
king
is
anxious
to
adopt
him
but
do
not
alarm
yourself
brother
i
hope
to
arrange
all
happily
with
the
divine
assistance
i
have
gained
some
power
over
them
and
i
will
avail
myself
of
it
a
year
ago
i
could
not
have
answered
for
the
life
of
the
prisoners
now
i
believe
them
to
be
in
safety
but
how
much
is
there
yet
to
teach
these
simple
children
of
nature
who
listen
only
to
her
voice
and
yield
to
every
impression
their
first
impulse
is
good
but
they
are
so
unsteady
that
affection
may
suddenly
change
to
hatred
they
are
inclined
to
theft
violent
in
their
anger
yet
generous
and
affectionate
you
will
see
an
instance
of
this
in
the
abode
where
a
woman
more
unfortunate
than
your
wife
since
she
has
lost
her
husband
has
found
an
asylum
he
was
silent
and
i
did
not
question
him
farther
on
this
subject
we
were
approaching
the
arm
of
the
sea
where
we
had
left
our
pinnace
and
my
heart
at
ease
about
the
rest
became
now
anxious
solely
for
ernest
sometimes
the
hills
concealed
the
water
from
us
fritz
climbed
them
anxious
to
discover
his
brother
at
last
i
heard
him
suddenly
cry
out
ernest
ernest
he
was
answered
by
shouts
or
rather
howls
amongst
which
i
could
not
distinguish
the
voice
of
my
son
terror
seized
me
these
are
the
islanders
said
i
to
the
missionary
and
these
frightful
cries
are
cries
of
joy
said
he
which
will
be
increased
when
they
see
you
this
path
will
conduct
us
to
the
shore
call
fritz
but
i
do
not
see
him
he
will
doubtless
have
descended
the
hill
and
joined
them
have
no
fears
recommend
your
sons
to
be
prudent
the
will
speak
to
his
black
friends
and
they
will
hear
him
we
proceeded
towards
the
shore
when
at
some
distance
i
perceived
my
two
sons
on
the
deck
of
the
pinnace
which
was
covered
with
the
islanders
to
whom
they
were
distributing
the
treasures
of
the
chest
at
least
those
we
had
put
apart
in
the
bag
they
had
not
been
so
imprudent
as
to
open
the
chest
itself
which
would
soon
have
been
emptied
it
remained
snugly
below
the
deck
with
the
at
every
new
acquisition
the
savages
uttered
cries
of
joy
repeating
signifying
the
mirrors
were
at
first
received
with
the
most
delight
but
this
soon
changed
into
terror
they
evidently
conceived
there
was
something
magical
about
them
and
flung
them
all
into
the
sea
the
coloured
glass
beads
had
then
the
preference
but
the
distribution
caused
many
disputes
those
who
had
not
obtained
any
wished
to
deprive
the
rest
of
them
by
force
the
clamour
and
quarrelling
were
increasing
when
the
voice
of
the
missionary
was
heard
and
calmed
them
as
if
by
enchantment
all
left
the
pinnace
and
crowded
round
him
he
harangued
them
in
their
own
language
and
pointed
me
out
to
them
naming
me
that
is
which
they
repeated
in
their
turn
some
approached
me
and
rubbed
their
noses
against
mine
which
the
pastor
had
informed
me
was
a
mark
of
respect
in
the
mean
time
fritz
had
informed
ernest
that
his
mother
and
brothers
were
found
and
that
the
man
who
accompanied
us
was
a
european
ernest
received
the
intelligence
with
a
calm
joy
it
was
only
by
the
tears
in
his
eyes
you
could
discover
how
much
his
heart
was
affected
he
leaped
from
the
pinnace
and
came
to
thank
the
missionary
i
had
my
share
of
his
gratitude
too
for
coming
to
seek
him
before
i
had
seen
the
dear
lost
ones
we
had
now
to
think
of
joining
them
we
unanimously
decided
to
proceed
by
water
in
the
first
place
that
we
might
bring
our
pinnace
as
near
as
possible
to
my
dear
elizabeth
who
was
still
suffering
from
her
fall
her
forced
voyage
and
above
all
from
her
anxiety
besides
i
confess
that
i
felt
a
little
fatigue
and
should
have
reluctantly
set
out
to
cross
the
wood
a
third
time
but
in
addition
to
this
i
was
assured
that
it
was
the
promptest
mode
of
reaching
our
friends
and
this
alone
would
have
decided
me
the
pinnace
was
then
loosened
the
sail
set
and
we
entered
with
thankfulness
dreading
the
agitation
of
my
wife
if
she
saw
us
suddenly
i
entreated
our
new
friend
to
precede
us
and
prepare
her
he
consented
but
as
he
was
coming
on
board
he
was
suddenly
stopped
by
the
natives
and
one
of
them
addressed
him
for
some
time
the
missionary
listened
till
he
had
concluded
with
calmness
and
dignity
then
turning
to
me
he
said
you
must
answer
for
me
brother
the
request
which
makes
he
wishes
me
in
the
name
of
the
whole
to
wait
a
few
moments
for
their
chief
to
whom
they
give
the
title
of
king
as
he
is
called
has
assembled
them
here
for
a
ceremony
at
which
all
his
warriors
must
assist
i
have
been
anxious
to
attend
fearing
it
might
be
a
sacrifice
to
their
idols
which
i
have
always
strongly
opposed
and
wishing
to
seize
this
occasion
to
declare
to
them
the
one
true
god
is
not
wicked
and
i
hope
to
succeed
in
touching
his
heart
enlightening
his
mind
and
converting
him
to
christianity
his
example
would
certainly
be
followed
by
the
greatest
part
of
his
subjects
who
are
much
attached
to
him
your
presence
and
the
name
of
god
uttered
by
you
with
the
fervour
and
in
the
attitude
of
profound
veneration
and
devotion
may
aid
this
work
of
charity
and
love
have
you
sufficient
to
delay
for
perhaps
a
few
hours
the
meeting
with
your
family
your
wife
and
children
not
expecting
you
will
not
suffer
from
suspense
if
you
do
not
agree
to
this
i
will
conduct
you
to
them
and
return
i
hope
in
time
to
fulfil
my
duty
i
wait
your
decision
to
reply
to
parabéry
who
is
already
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
truth
to
desire
that
his
king
and
his
brethren
should
know
it
also
such
were
the
words
of
this
true
servant
of
god
but
i
can
not
do
justice
to
the
expression
of
his
heavenly
countenance
willis
for
such
was
his
name
was
or
fifty
years
of
age
tall
and
thin
the
labours
and
fatigues
of
his
divine
vocation
had
more
than
years
left
their
traces
on
his
noble
figure
and
countenance
he
stooped
a
little
his
open
and
elevated
forehead
was
slightly
wrinkled
and
his
thin
hair
was
prematurely
grey
his
clear
blue
eyes
were
full
of
intelligence
and
kindness
reading
your
thoughts
and
showing
you
all
his
own
he
usually
kept
his
arms
folded
over
his
breast
and
was
very
calm
in
speaking
but
when
his
extended
hand
pointed
to
heaven
the
effect
was
irresistible
one
might
have
thought
he
saw
the
very
glory
he
spoke
of
his
simple
words
to
me
seemed
a
message
from
god
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
resist
him
it
was
indeed
a
sacrifice
but
i
made
it
without
hesitation
i
glanced
at
my
sons
who
had
their
eyes
cast
down
but
i
saw
fritz
knitting
his
brows
i
shall
stay
with
you
father
said
i
happy
if
i
can
assist
you
in
fulfilling
your
sacred
duties
and
you
young
people
said
he
are
you
of
the
same
opinion
fritz
came
forward
and
frankly
said
sir
it
was
unfortunately
i
who
wounded
my
brother
jack
he
has
been
generous
enough
to
conceal
this
you
extracted
the
ball
which
i
discharged
into
his
shoulder
i
owe
his
life
to
you
and
mine
is
at
your
disposal
i
can
refuse
you
nothing
and
however
impatient
i
must
remain
with
you
i
repeat
the
same
said
ernest
you
protected
our
mother
and
brothers
and
by
god
permission
you
restore
them
to
us
we
will
all
remain
with
you
you
shall
fix
the
time
of
our
meeting
which
will
not
i
trust
be
long
delayed
i
signified
my
approbation
and
the
missionary
gave
them
his
hand
assuring
them
that
their
joy
on
meeting
their
friends
would
be
greatly
increased
by
the
consciousness
of
this
virtuous
we
soon
experienced
this
willis
learned
from
parabéry
that
they
were
going
to
fetch
their
king
in
our
pretty
canoe
when
we
saw
it
pass
the
royal
habitation
was
situated
on
the
other
side
of
the
promontory
and
we
soon
heard
a
joyful
cry
that
they
saw
the
canoe
coming
while
the
savages
were
engaged
in
preparing
to
meet
their
chief
i
entered
the
pinnace
and
descending
beneath
the
deck
i
took
from
the
chest
what
i
judged
most
fitting
to
present
to
his
majesty
i
chose
an
axe
a
saw
a
pretty
small
ornamented
sabre
which
could
not
do
much
harm
a
packet
of
nails
and
one
of
i
had
scarcely
put
aside
these
articles
when
my
sons
rushed
to
me
in
great
excitement
oh
father
cried
they
at
once
look
look
summon
all
your
fortitude
see
there
is
francis
himself
in
the
canoe
oh
how
curiously
he
is
dressed
illustration
two
savages
took
francis
on
their
shoulders
and
two
others
took
the
king
in
the
same
way
i
looked
and
saw
at
some
distance
our
canoe
ascending
the
strait
it
was
decorated
with
green
branches
which
the
savages
who
formed
the
king
guard
held
in
their
hand
others
were
rowing
vigorously
and
the
chief
wearing
a
red
and
yellow
handkerchief
which
had
belonged
to
my
wife
as
a
turban
was
seated
at
the
stern
and
a
pretty
little
blooming
boy
was
placed
on
his
right
shoulder
with
what
delight
did
i
recognize
my
child
he
was
naked
above
the
waist
and
wore
a
little
tunic
of
woven
leaves
which
reached
to
his
knees
a
necklace
and
bracelets
of
shells
and
a
variety
of
coloured
feathers
mingled
with
his
bright
curls
one
of
these
fell
over
his
face
and
doubtless
prevented
him
from
seeing
us
the
chief
seemed
much
engaged
with
him
and
continually
took
some
ornament
from
his
own
dress
to
decorate
him
it
is
my
child
said
i
in
great
terror
to
willis
my
dearest
and
youngest
they
have
taken
him
from
his
mother
what
must
be
her
grief
he
is
her
benjamin
the
child
of
her
love
why
have
they
taken
him
why
have
they
adorned
him
in
this
manner
why
have
they
brought
him
here
have
no
fear
said
the
missionary
they
will
do
him
no
harm
i
promise
you
they
shall
restore
him
and
you
shall
take
him
back
to
his
mother
place
yourselves
at
my
side
with
these
branches
in
your
hands
he
took
some
from
parabéry
who
held
a
bundle
of
them
and
gave
us
each
one
each
of
the
savages
took
one
also
they
were
from
a
tree
which
had
slender
elegant
leaves
and
rich
scarlet
flowers
species
of
the
indians
call
it
the
tree
of
peace
they
carry
a
branch
of
it
when
they
have
no
hostile
intentions
in
all
their
assemblies
when
war
is
proclaimed
they
make
a
fire
of
these
branches
and
if
all
are
consumed
it
is
considered
an
omen
of
victory
while
willis
was
explaining
this
to
us
the
canoe
approached
two
savages
took
francis
on
their
shoulders
two
others
took
the
king
in
the
same
way
and
advanced
gravely
towards
us
what
difficulty
i
had
to
restrain
myself
from
snatching
my
child
from
his
bearers
and
embracing
him
my
sons
were
equally
agitated
fritz
was
darting
forward
but
the
missionary
restrained
him
francis
somewhat
alarmed
at
his
position
had
his
eyes
cast
down
and
had
not
yet
seen
us
when
the
king
was
within
twenty
yards
of
us
they
stopped
and
all
the
savages
prostrated
themselves
before
him
we
alone
remained
standing
then
francis
saw
us
and
uttered
a
piercing
cry
calling
out
papa
dear
brothers
he
struggled
to
quit
the
shoulders
of
his
bearers
but
they
held
him
too
firmly
it
was
impossible
to
restrain
ourselves
longer
we
all
cried
out
and
mingled
our
tears
and
lamentations
i
said
to
the
good
missionary
a
little
too
harshly
perhaps
ah
if
you
were
a
father
i
am
said
he
the
father
of
all
this
flock
and
your
children
are
mine
i
am
answerable
for
all
command
your
sons
to
be
silent
request
the
child
to
be
composed
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
i
immediately
took
advantage
of
the
permission
to
speak
dear
francis
said
i
holding
out
my
arms
we
are
come
to
seek
you
and
your
mother
after
all
our
dangers
we
shall
soon
meet
again
to
part
no
more
but
be
composed
my
child
and
do
not
risk
the
happiness
of
that
moment
by
any
impatience
trust
in
god
and
in
this
good
friend
that
he
has
given
us
and
who
has
restored
to
me
the
treasures
without
which
i
could
not
live
we
then
waved
our
hands
to
him
and
he
remained
still
but
wept
quietly
murmuring
our
names
papa
fritz
ernest
tell
me
about
mamma
said
he
at
last
in
an
inquiring
tone
she
does
not
know
we
are
so
near
her
said
i
how
did
you
leave
her
very
much
grieved
said
he
that
they
brought
me
away
but
they
have
not
done
me
any
harm
they
are
so
kind
and
we
shall
soon
all
go
back
to
her
oh
what
joy
for
her
and
our
friends
one
word
about
jack
said
fritz
how
does
his
wound
go
on
oh
pretty
well
answered
he
he
has
no
pain
now
and
sophia
nurses
him
and
amuses
him
how
little
matilda
would
weep
when
the
savages
carried
me
off
if
you
knew
papa
how
kind
and
good
she
is
i
had
no
time
to
ask
who
sophia
and
matilda
were
they
had
allowed
me
to
speak
to
my
son
to
tranquillize
him
but
the
king
now
commanded
silence
and
still
elevated
on
the
shoulders
of
his
people
began
to
harangue
the
assembly
he
was
a
man
with
striking
features
his
thick
lips
his
hair
tinged
with
red
paint
his
dark
brown
face
which
as
well
as
his
body
was
tattooed
with
white
gave
him
a
formidable
aspect
yet
his
countenance
was
not
unpleasant
and
announced
no
ferocity
in
general
these
savages
have
enormous
mouths
with
long
white
teeth
they
wear
a
tunic
of
reeds
or
leaves
from
the
waist
to
the
knees
my
wife
handkerchief
which
i
had
recognized
at
first
was
gracefully
twisted
round
the
head
of
the
king
his
hair
was
fastened
up
high
and
ornamented
with
feathers
but
he
had
nearly
removed
them
all
to
deck
my
boy
he
placed
him
at
his
side
and
frequently
pointed
him
out
during
his
speech
i
was
on
thorns
as
soon
as
he
had
concluded
the
savages
shouted
clapped
their
hands
and
surrounded
my
child
dancing
and
presenting
him
fruit
flowers
and
shells
crying
out
a
cry
in
which
the
king
who
was
now
standing
joined
also
what
does
the
word
mean
said
i
to
the
missionary
it
is
the
new
name
of
your
son
answered
he
or
rather
of
the
son
of
who
has
just
adopted
him
never
cried
i
darting
forward
boys
let
us
rescue
your
brother
from
these
barbarians
we
all
three
rushed
towards
francis
who
weeping
extended
his
arms
to
us
the
savages
attempted
to
repulse
us
but
at
that
moment
the
missionary
pronounced
some
words
in
a
loud
voice
they
immediately
prostrated
themselves
on
their
faces
and
we
had
no
difficulty
in
securing
the
child
we
brought
him
to
our
protector
who
still
remained
in
the
same
attitude
in
which
he
had
spoken
with
his
eyes
and
his
right
hand
raised
towards
heaven
he
made
a
sign
for
the
savages
to
rise
and
afterwards
spoke
for
some
time
to
them
what
would
i
have
given
to
have
understood
him
but
i
formed
some
idea
from
the
effect
of
his
words
he
frequently
pointed
to
us
pronouncing
the
word
and
particularly
addressed
the
king
who
listened
motionless
to
him
at
the
conclusion
of
his
speech
approached
and
attempted
to
take
hold
of
francis
who
threw
himself
into
my
arms
where
i
firmly
held
him
let
him
now
go
said
willis
and
fear
nothing
i
released
the
child
the
king
lifted
him
up
pressed
his
own
nose
to
his
then
placing
him
on
the
ground
took
away
the
feathers
and
necklace
with
which
he
had
decked
him
and
replaced
him
in
my
arms
rubbing
my
nose
also
and
repeating
several
words
in
my
first
emotion
i
threw
myself
on
my
knees
and
was
imitated
by
my
two
sons
it
is
well
cried
the
missionary
again
raising
his
eyes
and
hands
thus
should
you
offer
thanks
to
heaven
the
king
convinced
it
is
the
will
of
god
restores
your
child
and
wishes
to
become
your
friend
he
is
worthy
to
be
so
for
he
adores
and
fears
your
god
may
he
soon
learn
to
know
and
believe
all
the
truths
of
christianity
let
us
pray
together
that
the
time
may
come
when
on
these
shores
where
paternal
love
has
triumphed
i
may
see
a
temple
rise
to
the
father
of
all
the
god
of
peace
and
love
he
kneeled
down
and
the
king
and
all
his
people
followed
his
example
without
understanding
the
words
of
his
prayer
i
joined
in
the
spirit
of
it
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
i
then
presented
my
offerings
to
the
king
increasing
them
considerably
i
would
willingly
have
given
all
my
treasures
in
exchange
for
him
he
had
restored
to
me
my
sons
also
gave
something
to
each
of
the
savages
who
incessantly
cried
i
begged
willis
to
tell
the
king
i
gave
him
my
canoe
and
hoped
he
would
use
it
to
visit
us
in
our
island
to
which
we
were
returning
he
appeared
pleased
and
wished
to
accompany
us
in
our
pinnace
which
he
seemed
greatly
to
admire
some
of
his
people
followed
him
on
board
to
row
the
rest
placed
themselves
in
the
canoes
we
soon
entered
the
sea
again
and
doubling
the
second
point
we
came
to
an
arm
of
the
sea
much
wider
and
deep
enough
for
our
pinnace
and
which
conducted
us
to
the
object
of
our
dearest
hopes
chapter
liii
we
were
never
weary
with
caressing
our
dear
francis
we
were
very
anxious
to
learn
from
him
all
the
particulars
of
the
arrival
of
the
savages
in
our
island
the
seizure
of
his
mother
and
himself
their
voyage
and
their
residence
here
and
who
were
the
friends
they
had
met
with
but
it
was
impossible
his
tawny
majesty
never
left
us
for
a
moment
and
played
with
the
boy
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
himself
francis
showed
him
all
the
toys
from
our
chest
he
was
extremely
amused
with
the
small
mirrors
and
the
dolls
a
painted
carriage
driven
by
a
coachman
who
raised
his
whip
when
the
wheels
turned
appeared
miraculous
to
him
he
uttered
screams
of
delight
as
he
pointed
it
out
to
his
followers
the
ticking
of
my
watch
also
charmed
him
and
as
i
had
several
more
i
gave
him
it
showing
him
how
to
wind
it
up
but
the
first
time
he
tried
to
do
it
he
broke
the
spring
and
when
it
was
silent
he
cared
no
longer
for
it
but
threw
it
on
one
side
however
as
the
gold
was
very
glittering
he
took
it
up
again
and
suspending
it
from
the
handkerchief
that
was
wound
round
his
head
it
hung
over
his
nose
and
formed
a
striking
ornament
francis
showed
him
his
face
in
a
mirror
which
royal
amusement
made
him
laugh
heartily
he
asked
the
missionary
if
it
was
the
invisible
and
almighty
god
who
had
made
all
these
wonderful
things
willis
replied
that
it
was
he
who
gave
men
the
power
to
make
them
i
do
not
know
whether
comprehended
this
but
he
remained
for
some
time
in
deep
thought
i
profited
by
this
to
ask
the
missionary
what
were
the
words
which
had
terrified
them
so
when
they
wished
to
keep
my
son
from
me
and
which
had
compelled
them
to
surrender
him
i
told
them
answered
he
that
the
almighty
and
unseen
god
of
whom
i
spoke
to
them
daily
ordered
them
by
my
voice
to
restore
a
son
to
his
father
i
threatened
them
with
his
anger
if
they
refused
and
promised
them
his
mercy
if
they
obeyed
and
they
did
obey
the
first
step
is
gained
they
know
the
duty
of
adoring
and
obeying
god
every
other
truth
proceeds
from
this
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
savages
will
one
day
become
good
christians
my
method
of
instruction
is
suited
to
their
limited
capacity
i
prove
to
them
that
their
wooden
idols
made
by
their
own
hands
could
neither
create
hear
them
nor
protect
them
i
have
shown
them
god
in
his
works
have
declared
him
to
be
as
good
as
he
is
powerful
hating
evil
cruelty
murder
and
cannibalism
and
they
have
renounced
all
these
in
their
late
wars
they
have
either
released
or
adopted
their
prisoners
if
they
carried
off
your
wife
and
son
they
intended
it
for
a
good
action
as
you
will
soon
understand
i
could
not
ask
francis
any
questions
as
continued
playing
with
him
so
turning
to
ernest
i
asked
him
what
passed
when
the
savages
joined
him
when
you
left
me
said
he
i
amused
myself
by
searching
for
shells
plants
and
zoophytes
with
which
the
rocks
abound
and
i
have
added
a
good
deal
to
my
collection
i
was
at
some
distance
from
the
pinnace
when
i
heard
a
confused
sound
of
voices
and
concluded
that
the
savages
were
coming
in
fact
ten
or
a
dozen
issued
from
the
road
you
had
entered
and
i
can
not
comprehend
how
you
missed
meeting
them
fearing
they
would
attempt
to
take
possession
of
my
pinnace
i
returned
speedily
and
seized
a
loaded
musket
though
i
determined
to
use
it
only
to
defend
my
own
life
or
the
pinnace
i
stood
on
the
deck
in
an
attitude
as
bold
and
imposing
as
i
could
command
but
i
did
not
succeed
in
intimidating
them
they
leaped
one
after
the
other
on
deck
and
surrounded
me
uttering
loud
cries
i
could
not
discover
whether
they
were
cries
of
joy
or
of
fury
but
i
showed
no
fear
and
addressed
them
in
a
friendly
tone
in
some
words
from
capt
cook
vocabulary
but
they
did
not
seem
to
comprehend
me
neither
could
i
understand
any
of
theirs
except
father
which
they
frequently
repeated
and
woman
one
of
them
had
fritz
gun
from
which
i
concluded
they
were
of
the
party
that
had
carried
off
jack
i
took
it
and
showing
him
mine
endeavoured
to
make
him
understand
that
it
also
belonged
to
me
he
thought
i
wished
to
exchange
and
readily
offered
to
return
it
and
take
mine
this
would
not
have
suited
me
fritz
gun
was
discharged
and
i
could
not
let
them
have
mine
loaded
to
prevent
accident
surrounded
as
i
was
i
decided
to
give
them
a
fright
and
seeing
a
bird
flying
above
us
i
took
aim
so
correctly
that
my
shot
brought
down
the
bird
a
blue
pigeon
they
were
for
a
moment
stupified
with
terror
then
immediately
all
left
the
pinnace
except
parabéry
he
seemed
to
be
pleased
with
me
often
pointing
to
the
sky
saying
which
means
i
believe
his
comrades
were
examining
the
dead
bird
some
touched
their
own
shoulders
to
try
if
they
were
wounded
as
well
as
the
bird
and
jack
had
been
which
convinced
me
they
had
carried
him
off
i
tried
to
make
parabéry
understand
my
suspicion
and
i
think
i
succeeded
for
he
made
me
an
affirmative
sign
pointing
to
the
interior
of
the
island
and
touching
his
shoulder
with
an
air
of
pity
i
took
several
things
from
the
chest
and
gave
them
to
him
making
signs
that
he
should
show
them
to
the
others
and
induce
them
to
return
to
me
he
comprehended
me
very
well
and
complied
with
my
wishes
i
was
soon
surrounded
by
the
whole
party
begging
of
me
i
was
busy
distributing
beads
mirrors
and
small
knives
when
you
came
and
we
are
now
excellent
friends
two
or
three
of
them
returned
to
the
wood
and
brought
me
and
bananas
but
we
must
be
careful
to
hide
our
guns
of
which
they
have
a
holy
horror
and
now
dear
father
i
think
we
ought
not
to
call
these
people
they
have
the
simplicity
of
childhood
a
trifle
irritates
them
a
trifle
appeases
them
they
are
grateful
and
affectionate
i
find
them
neither
cruel
nor
barbarous
they
have
done
me
no
harm
when
they
might
easily
have
killed
me
thrown
me
into
the
sea
or
carried
me
away
we
must
not
said
i
judge
of
all
savage
people
by
these
who
have
had
the
benefit
of
a
virtuous
teacher
willis
has
already
cast
into
their
hearts
the
seeds
of
that
divine
religion
which
commands
us
to
do
unto
others
as
we
would
they
should
do
unto
us
and
to
pardon
and
love
our
enemies
while
we
were
discoursing
we
arrived
at
a
spot
where
the
canoes
had
already
landed
we
were
about
to
do
the
same
but
the
king
did
not
seem
inclined
to
quit
the
pinnace
but
continued
speaking
to
the
missionary
i
was
still
fearful
that
he
wished
to
keep
francis
to
whom
he
seemed
to
be
more
and
more
attached
holding
him
constantly
on
his
knee
but
at
last
to
my
great
joy
he
placed
him
in
my
arms
he
keeps
his
word
with
you
said
willis
you
may
carry
him
to
his
mother
but
in
return
he
wishes
you
to
permit
him
to
go
in
your
pinnace
to
his
abode
on
the
other
side
of
the
strait
that
he
may
show
it
to
the
women
and
he
promises
to
bring
it
back
perhaps
there
would
be
danger
in
refusing
him
i
agreed
with
him
but
still
there
was
a
difficulty
in
granting
this
request
if
he
chose
to
keep
it
how
should
we
return
besides
it
contained
our
only
barrel
of
powder
and
all
our
articles
of
traffic
and
how
could
we
expect
it
would
escape
pillage
willis
confessed
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
cure
their
fondness
for
theft
and
suggested
as
the
only
means
of
security
that
i
should
accompany
the
king
and
bring
the
pinnace
back
which
was
then
to
be
committed
to
the
charge
of
parabéry
for
whose
honesty
he
would
be
responsible
here
was
another
delay
the
day
was
so
far
advanced
that
i
might
not
perhaps
be
able
to
return
before
night
besides
though
my
wife
did
not
know
we
were
so
near
her
she
knew
they
had
carried
away
francis
and
she
would
certainly
be
very
uneasy
about
him
looked
very
impatient
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
answer
him
i
decided
at
once
i
resigned
francis
to
the
missionary
entreating
him
to
take
him
to
his
mother
to
prepare
her
for
our
approach
and
to
relate
the
cause
of
our
delay
i
told
my
sons
it
was
my
desire
they
should
accompany
me
fritz
agreed
rather
indignantly
and
ernest
with
calmness
willis
told
the
king
that
in
gratitude
to
him
and
to
do
him
honour
i
and
my
sons
wished
to
accompany
him
he
appeared
much
flattered
at
this
made
my
sons
seat
themselves
on
each
side
of
him
endeavoured
to
pronounce
their
names
and
finished
by
exchanging
names
as
a
token
of
friendship
calling
fritz
ernest
and
himself
willis
and
francis
left
us
our
hearts
were
sad
to
see
them
go
where
all
our
wishes
centred
but
the
die
was
cast
the
king
gave
the
signal
to
depart
the
canoes
took
the
lead
and
we
followed
in
an
hour
we
saw
the
royal
palace
it
was
a
tolerably
large
hut
constructed
of
bamboos
and
very
neatly
several
women
were
seated
before
it
busily
employed
in
making
the
short
petticoats
of
reeds
which
they
all
wore
their
hair
was
very
carefully
braided
in
tufts
on
the
crown
of
the
head
none
were
except
two
daughters
of
the
king
about
ten
and
twelve
years
old
who
though
very
dark
were
graceful
these
no
doubt
he
intended
for
wives
for
my
francis
we
disembarked
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
hut
the
women
came
to
meet
us
carrying
a
branch
of
the
mimosa
in
each
hand
they
then
performed
a
singular
kind
of
dance
entwining
their
arms
and
shaking
their
feet
but
never
moving
from
the
spot
this
they
accompanied
with
a
wild
chant
which
was
anything
but
musical
the
king
seemed
pleased
with
it
and
calling
his
wives
and
daughters
he
showed
them
his
and
calling
himself
he
then
joined
in
the
dance
dragging
my
sons
with
him
who
managed
it
pretty
well
as
for
me
he
treated
me
with
great
respect
always
calling
me
father
and
made
me
sit
down
on
a
large
trunk
of
a
tree
before
his
house
which
was
doubtless
his
throne
for
he
placed
me
there
with
great
ceremony
rubbing
his
royal
nose
against
mine
after
the
dance
was
concluded
the
women
retired
to
the
hut
and
returned
to
offer
us
a
collation
served
up
in
the
shells
of
it
was
a
sort
of
paste
composed
i
believe
of
different
sorts
of
fruit
mixed
up
with
a
kind
of
flour
and
the
milk
of
the
this
mixture
was
detestable
to
me
but
i
made
up
for
it
with
some
kernel
of
and
the
perceiving
that
i
liked
these
ordered
some
of
them
to
be
gathered
and
carried
to
the
pinnace
the
hut
was
backed
by
a
wood
of
palms
and
other
trees
so
that
our
provision
was
readily
made
still
there
was
time
for
my
sons
to
run
to
the
pinnace
attended
by
parabéry
and
bring
from
the
chest
some
beads
mirrors
scissors
needles
and
pins
to
distribute
to
the
ladies
when
they
brought
the
fruit
they
had
gathered
i
made
a
sign
to
to
take
them
to
see
the
pinnace
he
called
them
and
they
followed
him
timidly
and
submitting
to
his
wishes
in
everything
they
carried
the
fruit
two
and
two
in
a
sort
of
baskets
very
skilfully
woven
in
rushes
which
appeared
to
have
a
european
form
they
had
no
furniture
in
their
dwelling
but
mats
which
were
doubtless
their
beds
and
some
trunks
of
trees
serving
for
seats
and
tables
several
baskets
were
suspended
to
the
bamboo
which
formed
the
walls
and
also
lances
slings
clubs
and
other
similar
weapons
from
which
i
concluded
they
were
a
nation
of
warriors
i
did
not
observe
much
however
for
my
thoughts
were
in
the
future
and
i
was
very
impatient
for
our
departure
i
hastened
to
the
pinnace
and
my
sons
distributed
their
gifts
to
the
females
who
did
not
dare
to
express
their
delight
but
it
was
evident
in
their
countenances
they
immediately
began
to
adorn
themselves
with
their
presents
and
appeared
to
value
the
mirrors
much
more
than
their
husbands
had
done
they
soon
understood
their
use
and
employed
them
to
arrange
with
taste
the
strings
of
beads
round
their
necks
heads
and
arms
at
last
the
signal
was
given
for
our
departure
i
rubbed
my
nose
against
that
of
the
king
i
added
to
my
presents
a
packet
of
nails
and
one
of
gilt
buttons
which
he
seemed
to
covet
i
went
on
board
my
pinnace
and
conducted
by
the
good
parabéry
we
took
our
way
to
that
part
of
the
coast
where
the
dear
ones
resided
whom
i
so
anxiously
desired
to
see
some
of
the
savages
accompanied
us
in
their
own
canoe
we
should
have
preferred
having
only
our
friend
parabéry
but
we
were
not
the
masters
favoured
by
the
wind
we
soon
reached
the
shore
we
had
formerly
quitted
and
found
our
excellent
missionary
waiting
for
us
come
said
he
you
are
now
going
to
receive
your
reward
your
wife
and
children
impatiently
expect
you
they
would
have
come
to
meet
you
but
your
wife
is
still
weak
and
jack
suffering
your
presence
will
soon
cure
them
i
was
too
much
affected
to
answer
fritz
gave
me
his
arm
as
much
to
support
me
as
to
restrain
himself
from
rushing
on
before
ernest
did
the
same
with
willis
his
mildness
pleased
the
good
man
who
also
saw
his
taste
for
study
and
tried
to
encourage
it
after
half
an
walk
the
missionary
told
us
we
were
now
near
our
good
friends
i
saw
no
sign
of
a
habitation
nothing
but
trees
and
rocks
at
last
i
saw
a
light
smoke
among
the
trees
and
at
that
moment
francis
who
had
been
watching
ran
to
meet
us
mamma
is
expecting
you
said
he
showing
us
the
way
through
a
grove
of
shrubs
thick
enough
to
hide
entirely
the
entrance
into
a
kind
of
grotto
we
had
to
stoop
to
pass
into
it
it
resembled
much
the
entrance
of
the
bear
den
which
we
found
in
the
remote
part
of
our
island
a
mat
of
rushes
covered
the
opening
yet
permitted
the
light
to
penetrate
it
francis
removed
the
matting
calling
mamma
here
we
are
a
lady
apparently
about
years
of
age
of
mild
and
pleasing
appearance
came
forward
to
meet
me
she
a
clothed
in
a
rob
mad
of
tied
together
which
reached
from
her
throat
to
her
feet
leaving
her
beautiful
arms
uncovered
her
light
hair
was
braided
and
fastened
up
round
her
head
you
are
welcome
said
she
taking
my
hand
you
will
be
my
poor
friend
best
physician
we
entered
and
saw
my
dear
wife
seated
on
a
bed
of
moss
and
leaves
she
wept
abundantly
pointing
out
to
me
our
dear
boy
by
her
side
a
little
nymph
of
eleven
or
twelve
years
old
was
endeavouring
to
raise
him
here
are
your
papa
and
brothers
jack
said
she
you
are
very
happy
in
having
what
i
have
not
but
your
papa
will
be
mine
and
you
shall
be
my
brother
jack
thanked
her
affectionately
fritz
and
ernest
kneeling
beside
the
couch
embraced
their
mother
fritz
begged
her
to
forgive
him
for
hurting
his
brother
and
then
tenderly
inquired
of
jack
after
his
wound
for
me
i
can
not
describe
my
gratitude
and
agitation
i
could
scarce
utter
a
word
to
my
dear
wife
who
on
her
part
sunk
down
quite
overcome
on
her
bed
the
lady
who
was
i
understood
named
madame
hirtel
approached
to
assist
her
when
she
recovered
she
presented
to
me
madame
hirtel
and
her
two
daughters
the
eldest
sophia
was
attending
on
jack
matilda
who
was
about
ten
or
eleven
years
of
age
was
playing
with
francis
while
the
good
missionary
on
his
knees
thanked
god
for
having
us
and
for
life
cried
my
dear
wife
my
dear
husband
i
well
knew
you
would
set
out
to
seek
me
but
how
could
i
anticipate
that
you
would
ever
succeed
in
finding
me
we
will
now
separate
no
more
this
beloved
friend
has
agreed
to
accompany
us
to
the
happy
island
as
i
intend
to
call
it
if
i
ever
have
the
happiness
to
reach
it
again
with
all
i
love
in
the
world
how
graciously
god
permits
us
to
derive
blessings
from
our
sorrows
see
what
my
trial
has
produced
me
a
friend
and
two
dear
daughters
for
henceforward
we
are
only
one
family
we
were
mutually
delighted
with
this
arrangement
and
entreated
willis
to
visit
us
often
and
to
come
and
live
in
the
happy
island
when
his
mission
was
completed
i
will
consent
said
he
if
you
will
come
and
assist
me
in
my
duties
for
which
purpose
you
and
your
sons
must
acquire
the
language
of
these
islanders
we
are
much
nearer
your
island
than
you
think
for
you
took
a
very
circuitous
course
and
parabéry
who
knows
it
declares
it
is
only
a
day
voyage
with
a
fair
wind
and
moreover
he
tells
me
that
he
is
so
much
delighted
with
you
and
your
sons
that
he
can
not
part
with
you
and
wishes
me
to
obtain
your
permission
to
accompany
you
and
remain
with
you
he
will
be
exceedingly
useful
to
you
will
teach
the
language
to
you
all
and
will
be
a
ready
means
of
communication
between
us
i
gladly
agreed
to
take
parabéry
with
us
as
a
friend
but
it
was
no
time
yet
to
think
of
departing
as
willis
wished
to
have
jack
some
days
longer
under
his
care
we
therefore
arranged
that
i
and
my
two
sons
should
become
his
guests
as
his
hut
was
but
a
short
distance
off
we
had
many
things
to
hear
but
as
my
wife
was
yet
too
weak
to
relate
her
adventures
we
resolved
first
to
have
the
history
of
madame
hirtel
night
coming
on
the
missionary
lighted
a
gourd
lamp
and
after
a
light
collation
of
madame
hirtel
began
her
story
chapter
liv
my
life
she
began
passed
without
any
remarkable
events
till
the
misfortune
occurred
which
brought
me
to
this
island
i
was
married
when
very
young
to
hirtel
a
merchant
at
hamburg
an
excellent
man
whose
loss
i
have
deeply
felt
i
was
very
happy
in
this
union
arranged
by
my
parents
and
sanctioned
by
reason
we
had
three
children
a
son
and
two
daughters
in
the
first
three
years
of
our
marriage
and
hirtel
seeing
his
family
increase
so
rapidly
wished
to
increase
his
income
an
advantageous
establishment
was
offered
him
in
the
canary
islands
he
accepted
it
and
prevailed
on
me
to
settle
there
with
my
family
for
some
years
my
parents
were
dead
i
had
no
tie
to
detain
me
in
europe
i
was
going
to
see
new
regions
those
fortunate
isles
i
had
heard
so
much
of
and
i
set
out
joyfully
with
my
husband
and
children
little
foreseeing
the
misfortunes
before
me
our
voyage
was
favourable
the
children
like
myself
were
delighted
with
the
novelties
of
it
i
was
then
years
old
sophia
seven
matilda
six
and
alfred
our
pretty
gentle
boy
not
yet
five
poor
child
he
was
the
darling
and
the
plaything
of
all
the
crew
she
wept
bitterly
for
a
few
moments
and
then
resumed
her
narration
he
was
as
fair
as
your
own
francis
and
greatly
resembled
him
we
proceeded
first
to
bourdeaux
where
my
husband
had
a
correspondent
with
whom
he
had
large
dealings
by
his
means
my
husband
was
enabled
to
raise
large
sums
for
his
new
undertaking
we
carried
with
us
in
fact
nearly
his
whole
fortune
we
under
the
most
favourable
auspices
the
weather
delightful
and
the
wind
fair
but
we
very
soon
had
a
change
we
were
met
by
a
terrible
storm
and
hurricane
such
as
the
sailors
had
never
witnessed
for
a
week
our
ship
was
tossed
about
by
contrary
winds
driven
into
unknown
seas
lost
all
its
rigging
and
was
at
last
so
broken
that
the
water
poured
in
on
all
sides
all
was
lost
apparently
but
in
this
extremity
my
husband
made
a
last
attempt
to
save
us
he
tied
my
daughters
and
myself
firmly
to
a
plank
taking
the
charge
of
my
boy
himself
as
he
feared
the
additional
weight
would
be
too
much
for
our
raft
his
intention
was
to
tie
himself
to
another
plank
to
fasten
this
to
ours
and
taking
his
son
in
his
arms
to
give
us
a
chance
of
being
carried
to
the
shore
which
did
not
appear
far
off
whilst
he
was
occupied
in
placing
us
he
gave
alfred
to
the
care
of
a
sailor
who
was
particularly
attached
to
him
i
heard
the
man
say
him
with
me
i
will
take
care
to
save
him
on
this
hirtel
insisted
on
his
restoring
him
and
i
cried
out
that
he
should
be
given
to
me
at
that
moment
the
ship
which
was
already
fallen
on
its
side
filled
rapidly
with
water
plunged
and
disappeared
with
all
on
board
the
plank
on
which
i
and
my
daughters
were
fixed
alone
floated
and
i
saw
nothing
but
death
and
desolation
round
me
madame
hirtel
paused
almost
suffocated
by
the
remembrance
of
that
awful
moment
poor
woman
said
my
wife
weeping
it
is
five
years
since
this
misfortune
it
was
at
the
same
time
as
our
shipwreck
and
was
doubtless
caused
by
the
same
storm
but
how
much
more
fortunate
was
i
i
lost
none
that
were
dear
to
me
and
we
even
had
the
vessel
left
for
our
use
but
my
dear
unfortunate
friend
by
what
miracle
were
you
saved
it
was
he
who
only
can
work
miracles
said
the
missionary
who
cares
for
the
widow
and
the
orphan
and
without
whose
word
not
a
hair
of
the
head
can
perish
who
at
that
moment
gave
courage
to
the
christian
mother
my
strength
continued
she
was
nearly
exhausted
when
after
being
tossed
about
by
the
furious
waves
i
found
myself
thrown
upon
what
i
supposed
to
be
a
with
my
two
children
i
envied
the
state
of
my
husband
and
son
if
i
had
not
been
a
mother
i
should
have
wished
to
have
followed
them
but
my
two
girls
lay
senseless
at
my
side
and
i
was
anxious
as
i
perceived
they
still
breathed
to
recover
them
at
the
moment
hirtel
pushed
the
raft
into
the
water
he
threw
upon
it
a
box
bound
with
iron
which
i
grasped
mechanically
and
still
held
when
we
were
left
on
shore
it
was
not
locked
yet
it
was
with
some
difficulty
in
my
confined
position
that
i
succeeded
in
opening
it
it
contained
a
quantity
of
gold
and
which
i
looked
upon
with
contempt
and
regret
but
there
was
something
useful
in
the
box
in
the
morocco
portfolio
which
contained
the
there
were
the
usual
little
instruments
a
knife
scissors
pencils
stiletto
and
also
a
small
bottle
of
eau
de
cologne
which
was
particularly
serviceable
in
restoring
my
children
i
began
by
cutting
the
cords
that
tied
us
i
then
rubbed
my
dear
children
with
the
eau
de
cologne
made
them
inhale
it
and
even
swallow
a
little
the
wind
was
still
blowing
but
the
clouds
began
to
break
and
the
sun
appeared
which
dried
and
warmed
us
my
poor
children
opened
their
eyes
and
knew
me
and
i
felt
i
was
not
utterly
comfortless
but
their
first
words
were
to
ask
for
their
father
and
brother
i
could
not
tell
them
they
were
no
more
i
tried
to
deceive
myself
to
support
my
strength
by
a
feeble
and
delusive
hope
hirtel
swam
well
the
sailor
still
better
and
the
last
words
i
had
heard
still
rung
in
my
ears
not
be
uneasy
i
will
save
the
child
if
i
saw
anything
floating
at
a
distance
my
heart
began
to
beat
and
i
ran
towards
the
water
but
i
saw
it
was
only
wreck
which
i
could
not
even
reach
some
pieces
were
however
thrown
on
shore
and
with
these
and
our
own
raft
i
was
enabled
to
make
a
sort
of
shelter
by
resting
them
against
a
rock
my
poor
children
by
crouching
under
this
sheltered
themselves
from
the
rain
or
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
preserve
a
large
beaver
hat
which
i
wore
at
the
time
and
this
protected
me
but
these
resources
gave
me
little
consolation
my
children
were
complaining
of
hunger
and
i
felt
only
how
much
we
were
in
want
of
i
had
seen
a
on
the
shore
resembling
the
oyster
or
muscle
i
collected
some
and
opening
them
with
my
knife
we
made
a
repast
on
them
which
sufficed
for
the
first
day
night
came
my
children
offered
up
their
evening
prayer
and
i
earnestly
besought
the
succour
of
the
almighty
i
then
lay
down
beside
my
babes
on
our
raft
as
conveniently
as
we
could
and
they
soon
slept
the
fearful
thoughts
of
the
past
and
dreadful
anticipations
of
the
future
prevented
me
from
sleeping
my
situation
was
indeed
melancholy
but
i
felt
as
a
mother
i
ought
not
to
wish
for
death
as
soon
as
day
broke
i
went
close
to
the
shore
to
seek
some
for
our
breakfast
in
crossing
the
sand
i
nearly
plunged
my
foot
into
a
hole
and
fancied
i
heard
a
crash
i
stooped
and
putting
my
hand
into
the
opening
found
it
was
full
of
eggs
i
had
broken
two
or
three
which
i
tasted
and
thought
very
good
from
the
colour
form
and
taste
i
knew
them
to
be
turtle
eggs
there
were
at
least
sixty
so
i
had
no
more
care
about
food
i
carried
away
in
my
apron
as
many
as
i
could
preserve
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
this
i
endeavoured
to
effect
by
burying
them
in
the
sand
and
covering
them
with
one
end
of
our
plank
and
succeeded
very
well
besides
these
there
were
as
many
to
be
found
on
the
shore
as
we
required
i
have
sometimes
found
as
many
as
ninety
together
these
were
our
sole
support
while
we
remained
there
my
children
liked
them
very
much
i
forgot
to
add
that
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
a
stream
of
fresh
water
running
into
the
sea
it
was
the
same
which
runs
past
this
house
and
which
conducted
me
here
the
first
day
we
suffered
greatly
from
thirst
but
on
the
second
we
met
with
the
stream
which
saved
us
i
will
not
tire
you
by
relating
day
by
day
our
sad
life
every
one
was
the
same
and
took
away
by
degrees
every
hope
from
me
as
long
as
i
dared
to
indulge
any
i
could
not
bear
to
leave
the
shore
but
at
last
it
became
insupportable
to
me
i
was
worn
out
with
gazing
continually
on
that
boundless
horizon
and
that
moving
crystal
which
had
swallowed
up
my
hopes
i
pined
for
the
verdure
and
shade
of
trees
although
i
had
contrived
to
make
for
my
daughters
little
hats
of
a
marine
rush
they
suffered
much
from
the
extreme
heat
the
burning
rays
of
a
tropical
sun
i
decided
at
last
to
abandon
that
sandy
shore
to
penetrate
at
all
risks
into
the
country
in
order
to
seek
a
shady
and
cooler
abode
and
to
escape
from
the
view
of
that
sea
which
was
so
painful
to
me
i
resolved
not
to
quit
the
stream
which
was
so
precious
to
us
for
not
having
any
vessel
to
contain
water
i
could
not
carry
it
with
us
sophia
who
is
naturally
quick
formed
from
a
large
leaf
a
sort
of
goblet
which
served
us
to
drink
from
and
i
filled
my
pockets
with
turtles
eggs
as
provision
for
a
few
days
i
then
set
off
with
my
two
children
after
praying
the
god
of
all
mercy
to
watch
over
us
and
taking
leave
of
the
vast
tomb
which
held
my
husband
and
my
son
i
never
lost
sight
of
the
stream
if
any
obstacle
obliged
me
to
turn
a
little
way
from
it
i
soon
recovered
my
path
my
eldest
daughter
who
was
very
strong
and
robust
followed
me
stoutly
as
i
took
care
not
to
walk
too
far
without
resting
but
i
was
often
compelled
to
carry
my
little
matilda
on
my
shoulders
both
were
delighted
with
the
shade
of
the
woods
and
were
so
amused
with
the
delightful
birds
that
inhabited
them
and
a
pretty
little
sportive
green
monkey
that
they
became
as
playful
as
ever
they
sang
and
prattled
but
often
asked
me
if
papa
and
alfred
would
not
soon
return
to
see
these
pretty
creatures
and
if
we
were
going
to
seek
them
these
words
rent
my
heart
and
i
thought
it
best
then
to
tell
them
they
would
meet
no
more
on
earth
and
that
they
were
both
gone
to
heaven
to
that
good
god
to
whom
they
prayed
morning
and
evening
sophia
was
very
thoughtful
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
will
pray
to
god
more
than
ever
said
she
he
may
make
them
happy
and
send
them
back
to
us
said
matilda
we
left
the
sea
to
go
to
heaven
shall
we
soon
be
there
and
shall
we
see
beautiful
birds
like
these
we
walked
on
very
slowly
making
frequent
rests
till
night
drew
on
and
it
was
necessary
to
find
a
place
for
repose
i
fixed
on
a
sort
of
thick
grove
which
i
could
only
enter
by
stooping
it
was
formed
of
one
tree
whose
branches
reaching
the
ground
take
root
there
and
soon
produce
other
stems
which
follow
the
same
course
and
become
in
time
an
almost
impenetrable
thicket
here
i
found
a
place
for
us
to
lie
down
which
appeared
sheltered
from
wild
beasts
or
savages
whom
i
equally
dreaded
we
had
still
some
eggs
which
we
ate
but
i
saw
with
fear
that
the
time
approached
when
we
must
have
more
food
which
i
knew
not
where
to
find
i
saw
indeed
some
fruits
on
the
trees
but
i
did
not
know
them
and
feared
to
give
them
to
my
children
who
wished
to
have
them
i
saw
also
but
quite
out
of
my
reach
and
even
if
i
could
have
got
them
i
did
not
know
how
to
open
them
the
tree
under
whose
branches
we
had
found
protection
was
i
conjectured
an
american
it
bore
a
quantity
of
fruit
very
small
and
red
and
like
the
european
fig
i
ventured
to
taste
them
and
found
them
inferior
to
ours
insipid
and
soft
but
i
thought
quite
harmless
i
remarked
that
the
little
green
monkeys
ate
them
greedily
so
i
had
no
more
fear
and
allowed
my
children
to
regale
themselves
i
was
much
more
afraid
of
wild
beasts
during
the
night
however
i
had
seen
nothing
worse
than
some
little
quadrupeds
resembling
the
rabbit
or
squirrel
which
came
in
numbers
to
shelter
themselves
during
the
night
under
our
tree
the
children
wished
to
catch
one
but
i
could
not
undertake
to
increase
my
charge
we
had
a
quiet
night
and
were
early
awaked
by
the
songs
of
the
birds
how
delighted
i
was
to
have
escaped
the
noise
of
the
waves
and
to
feel
the
freshness
of
the
woods
and
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
with
which
my
children
made
garlands
to
decorate
my
head
and
their
own
these
ornaments
during
this
time
of
mourning
and
bereavement
affected
me
painfully
and
i
was
weak
enough
to
forbid
them
this
innocent
pleasure
i
tore
away
my
garland
and
threw
it
into
the
rivulet
flowers
said
i
do
not
dress
yourselves
in
them
they
are
no
fitting
ornaments
for
us
your
father
and
alfred
can
not
see
them
they
were
silent
and
sad
and
threw
their
garlands
into
the
water
as
i
had
done
we
followed
the
stream
and
passed
two
more
nights
under
the
trees
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
more
figs
but
they
did
not
satisfy
us
and
our
eggs
were
exhausted
in
my
distress
i
almost
decided
to
return
to
the
shore
where
we
might
at
least
meet
with
that
nourishment
as
i
sat
by
the
stream
reflecting
mournfully
on
our
situation
the
children
who
had
been
throwing
stones
into
the
water
cried
out
mamma
what
pretty
fishes
i
saw
indeed
a
quantity
of
small
in
the
river
but
how
could
i
take
them
i
tried
to
seize
them
with
my
hands
but
could
not
catch
them
necessity
however
is
the
mother
of
invention
i
cut
a
number
of
branches
with
my
knife
and
wove
them
together
to
make
a
kind
of
light
hurdle
the
breadth
of
the
stream
which
was
very
narrow
just
here
i
made
two
of
these
my
daughters
assisted
me
and
were
soon
very
skilful
we
then
undressed
ourselves
and
took
a
bath
which
refreshed
us
much
i
placed
one
of
my
hurdles
upright
across
the
rivulet
and
the
second
a
little
lower
the
fishes
who
remained
between
attempted
to
pass
but
the
hurdles
were
woven
too
close
we
watched
for
them
attempting
the
other
passage
many
escaped
us
but
we
captured
sufficient
for
our
dinner
we
threw
them
out
upon
the
grass
at
a
distance
from
the
stream
so
that
they
could
not
leap
back
my
daughters
had
taken
more
than
i
but
the
sensible
sophia
threw
back
those
we
did
not
require
to
give
them
pleasure
she
said
and
matilda
did
the
same
to
see
them
leap
we
then
removed
our
hurdles
dressed
ourselves
and
i
began
to
consider
how
i
should
cook
my
fish
for
i
had
no
fire
and
had
never
kindled
one
myself
however
i
had
often
seen
hirtel
who
was
a
smoker
light
his
pipe
by
means
of
the
flint
and
steel
they
were
in
the
precious
morocco
case
together
with
tinder
and
matches
i
tried
to
strike
a
light
and
after
some
difficulty
succeeded
i
collected
the
fragments
of
the
branches
used
for
the
hurdles
the
children
gathered
some
dry
leaves
and
i
had
soon
a
bright
lively
fire
which
i
was
delighted
to
see
notwithstanding
the
heat
of
the
climate
i
scraped
the
scales
from
the
fish
with
my
knife
washed
them
in
the
rivulet
and
then
placed
them
on
the
fire
to
broil
this
was
my
apprenticeship
in
the
art
of
cookery
i
thought
how
useful
it
would
be
to
give
young
ladies
some
knowledge
of
the
useful
arts
for
who
can
foresee
what
they
may
need
our
european
dinner
delighted
us
as
much
as
the
bath
and
the
fishing
which
had
preceded
it
i
decided
to
fix
our
residence
at
the
side
of
the
rivulet
and
beneath
the
my
only
objection
being
the
fear
of
missing
some
passing
vessel
which
might
carry
us
back
to
europe
but
can
you
understand
my
feelings
when
i
confess
to
you
that
although
overcome
by
sorrow
and
desolation
having
lost
husband
son
and
fortune
knowing
that
in
order
to
support
myself
and
bring
up
my
children
i
must
depend
upon
my
friends
and
to
attain
this
having
to
hazard
again
the
dangers
of
the
sea
the
very
thought
of
which
made
me
shudder
i
should
prefer
to
remain
where
providence
had
brought
me
and
live
calmly
without
obligation
to
any
one
i
might
certainly
have
some
difficulty
in
procuring
the
means
of
supporting
a
life
which
was
dear
to
me
for
the
sake
of
my
children
but
even
this
was
an
employment
and
an
amusement
my
children
would
early
learn
to
bear
privations
to
content
themselves
with
a
simple
and
frugal
life
and
to
labour
for
their
own
support
i
might
teach
them
all
that
i
knew
would
be
useful
to
them
in
future
and
above
all
impress
upon
their
young
minds
the
great
truths
of
our
holy
religion
by
bringing
this
constantly
before
their
unsophisticated
understanding
i
might
hope
they
would
draw
from
it
the
necessary
virtues
of
resignation
and
contentment
i
was
only
years
of
age
and
might
hope
by
god
mercy
to
be
spared
to
them
some
time
and
in
the
course
of
years
who
knew
what
might
happen
besides
we
were
not
so
far
from
the
sea
but
that
i
might
visit
it
sometimes
if
it
were
only
to
seek
for
turtles
eggs
i
remained
then
under
our
at
night
and
by
day
on
the
borders
of
the
stream
it
was
under
a
also
said
my
wife
that
i
have
spent
four
happy
years
of
my
life
unknown
to
each
other
our
fate
has
been
similar
but
henceforward
i
hope
we
shall
not
be
separated
madame
hirtel
embraced
her
kind
friend
and
observing
that
the
evening
was
advanced
and
that
my
wife
after
such
agitation
needed
repose
we
agreed
to
defer
till
next
day
the
conclusion
of
the
interesting
narrative
my
elder
sons
and
myself
followed
the
missionary
to
his
hut
which
resembled
the
king
though
it
was
smaller
it
was
constructed
of
bamboos
bound
together
and
the
intervals
filled
with
moss
and
clay
it
was
covered
in
the
same
way
and
was
tolerably
solid
a
mat
in
one
corner
without
any
covering
formed
his
bed
but
he
brought
out
a
bear
skin
which
he
used
in
winter
and
which
he
now
spread
on
the
ground
for
us
i
had
observed
a
similar
one
in
the
grotto
and
he
told
us
we
should
hear
the
history
of
these
skins
next
day
in
the
continuation
of
the
story
of
emily
or
as
she
was
affectionately
called
by
all
we
retired
to
our
couch
after
a
prayer
from
willis
and
for
the
first
time
since
my
dear
wife
was
taken
from
me
i
slept
in
peace
chapter
lv
we
went
to
the
grotto
early
in
the
morning
and
found
our
two
invalids
much
improved
my
wife
had
slept
better
and
willis
found
wound
going
on
well
madame
told
her
daughters
to
prepare
breakfast
they
went
out
and
soon
returned
with
a
native
woman
and
a
boy
of
four
or
five
years
old
carrying
rush
baskets
filled
with
all
sorts
of
fruit
figs
guavas
strawberries
and
the
i
must
introduce
you
said
emily
to
the
rest
of
my
family
this
is
canda
the
wife
of
your
friend
parabéry
and
this
is
their
son
whom
i
regard
as
my
own
your
elizabeth
is
already
attached
to
them
and
bespeaks
your
friendship
for
them
they
will
follow
us
to
the
happy
island
oh
if
you
knew
said
francis
what
a
boy
minou
is
he
can
climb
trees
run
and
leap
though
he
is
less
than
i
am
he
must
be
my
friend
and
canda
said
elizabeth
shall
be
our
assistant
and
friend
she
gave
her
hand
to
canda
i
did
the
same
and
caressed
the
boy
who
seemed
delighted
with
me
and
to
my
great
surprise
spoke
to
me
in
very
good
german
the
mother
too
knew
several
words
of
the
language
they
busied
themselves
with
our
breakfast
opened
the
and
poured
the
milk
into
the
shells
after
separating
the
kernel
they
arranged
the
fruits
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
which
served
for
a
table
and
did
great
credit
to
the
talent
of
their
instructress
i
should
have
liked
to
have
offered
you
coffee
said
madame
hirtel
which
grows
in
this
island
but
having
no
utensils
for
roasting
grinding
or
preparing
it
it
has
been
useless
to
me
and
i
have
not
even
gathered
it
do
you
think
my
dear
that
it
would
grow
in
our
island
said
my
wife
to
me
in
some
anxiety
i
then
recollected
for
the
first
time
how
fond
my
wife
was
of
coffee
which
in
europe
had
always
been
her
favourite
breakfast
there
would
certainly
be
in
the
ship
some
bags
which
i
might
have
brought
away
but
i
had
never
thought
of
it
and
my
unselfish
wife
not
seeing
it
had
never
named
it
except
once
wishing
we
had
some
to
plant
in
the
garden
now
that
there
was
a
probability
of
obtaining
it
she
confessed
that
coffee
and
bread
were
the
only
luxuries
she
regretted
i
promised
to
try
and
cultivate
it
in
our
island
foreseeing
however
that
it
would
probably
not
be
of
the
best
quality
i
told
her
she
must
not
expect
mocha
but
her
long
privation
from
this
delicious
beverage
had
made
her
less
fastidious
and
she
assured
me
it
would
be
a
treat
to
her
after
breakfast
we
begged
madame
hirtel
to
resume
her
interesting
narrative
she
continued
after
the
reflections
on
my
situation
which
i
told
you
of
last
night
i
determined
only
to
return
to
the
when
our
food
failed
us
in
the
woods
but
i
acquired
other
means
of
procuring
it
encouraged
by
the
success
of
my
fishing
i
made
a
sort
of
net
from
the
filaments
of
the
bark
of
a
tree
and
a
plant
resembling
hemp
with
these
i
succeeded
in
catching
some
birds
one
resembling
our
thrush
was
very
fat
and
of
delicious
flavour
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
overcoming
my
repugnance
to
taking
away
their
life
nothing
but
the
obligation
of
preserving
our
own
could
have
reconciled
me
to
it
my
children
plucked
them
i
then
spitted
them
on
a
slender
branch
and
roasted
them
before
the
fire
i
also
found
some
nests
of
eggs
which
i
concluded
were
those
of
the
wild
ducks
which
frequented
our
stream
i
made
myself
acquainted
with
all
the
fruits
which
the
monkeys
and
parroquets
eat
and
which
were
not
out
of
my
reach
i
found
a
sort
of
acorn
which
had
the
flavour
of
a
nut
the
children
also
discovered
plenty
of
large
strawberries
a
delicious
repast
and
i
found
a
quantity
of
honeycomb
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
which
i
obtained
by
stupifying
the
bees
with
a
smoking
brand
i
took
care
to
mark
down
every
day
on
the
blank
leaves
of
my
i
had
now
marked
thirty
days
of
my
wandering
life
on
the
border
of
the
river
for
i
never
strayed
beyond
the
sound
of
its
waters
still
i
kept
continually
advancing
towards
the
interior
of
the
island
i
had
yet
met
with
nothing
alarming
and
the
weather
had
been
most
favourable
but
we
were
not
long
to
enjoy
this
comfort
the
rainy
season
came
on
and
one
night
to
my
great
distress
i
heard
it
descend
in
torrents
we
were
no
longer
under
our
which
would
have
sheltered
us
for
a
considerable
time
the
tree
under
which
we
now
were
had
tempted
me
by
having
several
cavities
between
the
roots
filled
with
soft
moss
which
formed
natural
couches
but
the
foliage
was
very
thin
and
we
were
soon
drenched
completely
i
crept
near
my
poor
children
to
protect
them
a
little
but
in
vain
our
little
bed
was
soon
filled
with
water
and
we
were
compelled
to
leave
it
our
clothes
were
so
heavy
with
the
rain
that
we
could
scarcely
stand
and
the
night
was
so
dark
that
we
could
see
no
road
and
ran
the
risk
of
falling
or
striking
against
some
tree
if
we
moved
my
children
wept
and
i
trembled
for
their
health
and
for
my
own
which
was
so
necessary
to
them
this
was
one
of
the
most
terrible
nights
of
my
pilgrimage
my
children
and
i
knelt
down
and
i
prayed
to
our
heavenly
father
for
strength
to
bear
this
trial
if
it
was
his
will
to
continue
it
i
felt
consolation
and
strength
from
my
prayers
and
rose
with
courage
and
confidence
and
though
the
rain
continued
unabated
i
waited
with
resignation
the
pleasure
of
the
almighty
i
reconciled
my
children
to
our
situation
and
sophia
told
me
she
had
asked
her
father
who
was
near
the
gracious
god
to
entreat
him
to
send
no
more
rain
but
let
the
sun
come
back
i
assured
them
god
would
not
forget
them
they
began
to
be
accustomed
to
the
rain
only
sophia
begged
they
might
take
off
their
clothes
and
then
it
would
be
like
a
bath
in
the
brook
i
consented
to
this
thinking
they
would
be
less
liable
to
suffer
than
by
wearing
their
wet
garments
the
day
began
to
break
and
i
determined
to
walk
on
without
stopping
in
order
to
warm
ourselves
by
the
motion
and
to
try
to
find
some
cave
some
hollow
tree
or
some
tree
with
thick
foliage
to
shelter
us
the
next
night
i
undressed
the
children
and
made
a
bundle
of
their
clothes
which
i
would
have
carried
myself
but
i
found
they
would
not
be
too
heavy
for
them
and
i
judged
it
best
to
accustom
them
early
to
the
difficulties
fatigue
and
labour
which
would
be
their
lot
and
to
attend
entirely
on
themselves
i
therefore
divided
the
clothes
into
two
unequal
bundles
proportioned
to
their
strength
and
having
made
a
knot
in
each
i
passed
a
slender
branch
through
it
and
showed
them
how
to
carry
it
on
their
shoulders
when
i
saw
them
walking
before
me
in
this
savage
fashion
with
their
little
white
bodies
exposed
to
the
storm
i
could
not
refrain
from
tears
i
blamed
myself
for
condemning
them
to
such
an
existence
and
thought
of
returning
to
the
shore
where
some
vessel
might
rescue
us
but
we
were
now
too
far
off
to
set
about
it
i
continued
to
proceed
with
much
more
difficulty
than
my
children
who
had
nothing
on
but
their
shoes
and
large
hats
i
carried
the
valuable
box
in
which
i
had
placed
the
remains
of
our
last
night
supper
an
act
of
necessary
prudence
as
there
was
neither
fishing
nor
hunting
now
as
the
day
advanced
the
rain
diminished
and
even
the
sun
appeared
above
the
horizon
my
darlings
said
i
has
heard
us
and
sent
his
sun
to
warm
and
cheer
us
let
us
thank
him
has
begged
it
of
him
said
matilda
mamma
let
us
pray
him
to
send
alfred
back
my
poor
little
girl
bitterly
regretted
the
loss
of
her
brother
even
now
she
can
scarcely
hear
his
name
without
tears
when
the
savages
brought
francis
to
us
she
at
first
took
him
for
her
brother
how
you
have
grown
in
heaven
cried
she
and
after
she
discovered
he
was
not
her
brother
she
often
said
to
him
i
wish
your
name
was
alfred
forgive
me
for
dwelling
so
long
on
the
details
of
my
wretched
journey
which
was
not
without
its
comforts
in
the
pleasure
i
took
in
the
development
of
my
children
minds
and
in
forming
plans
for
their
future
education
though
anything
relating
to
science
or
the
usual
accomplishments
would
be
useless
to
them
i
did
not
wish
to
bring
them
up
like
young
savages
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
communicate
much
useful
knowledge
to
them
and
to
give
them
juster
ideas
of
this
world
and
that
to
come
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
dried
them
i
made
them
put
on
their
dresses
and
we
continued
our
walk
by
the
brook
till
we
arrived
at
the
grove
which
is
before
this
rock
i
removed
the
branches
to
pass
through
it
and
saw
beyond
them
the
entrance
to
this
grotto
it
was
very
low
and
narrow
but
i
could
not
help
uttering
a
cry
of
joy
for
this
was
the
only
sort
of
retreat
that
could
securely
shelter
us
i
was
going
to
enter
it
without
thought
not
reflecting
there
might
be
in
it
some
ferocious
animal
when
i
was
arrested
by
a
plaintive
cry
more
like
that
of
a
child
than
a
wild
beast
i
advanced
with
more
caution
and
tried
to
find
out
what
sort
of
an
inhabitant
the
cave
contained
it
was
indeed
a
human
being
an
infant
whose
age
i
could
not
discover
but
it
seemed
too
young
to
walk
and
was
besides
tied
up
in
leaves
and
moss
enclosed
in
a
piece
of
bark
which
was
much
torn
and
rent
the
poor
infant
uttered
the
most
piteous
cries
and
i
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
to
enter
the
cave
and
to
take
the
innocent
little
creature
in
my
arms
it
ceased
its
cries
as
soon
as
it
felt
the
warmth
of
my
cheek
but
it
was
evidently
in
want
of
food
and
i
had
nothing
to
give
it
but
some
figs
of
which
i
pressed
the
juice
into
its
mouth
this
seemed
to
satisfy
it
and
rocking
it
in
my
arms
it
soon
went
to
sleep
i
had
then
time
to
examine
it
and
to
look
round
the
cave
from
the
size
and
form
of
the
face
i
concluded
it
might
be
older
than
i
had
first
thought
and
i
recollected
to
have
read
that
the
savages
carried
their
children
swaddled
up
in
this
way
even
till
they
could
walk
the
complexion
of
the
child
was
a
pale
olive
which
i
have
since
discovered
is
the
natural
complexion
of
the
natives
before
the
exposure
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
gives
them
the
bronze
hue
you
have
seen
the
features
were
good
except
that
the
lips
were
thicker
and
the
mouth
larger
than
those
of
the
europeans
my
two
girls
were
charmed
with
it
and
caressed
it
with
great
joy
i
left
them
to
rock
it
gently
in
its
cradle
of
bark
till
i
went
round
this
cave
which
i
intended
for
my
palace
and
which
i
have
never
quitted
you
see
it
the
form
is
not
changed
but
since
heaven
has
sent
me
a
friend
looking
at
the
missionary
it
is
adorned
with
furniture
and
utensils
which
have
completed
my
comforts
but
to
return
the
grotto
was
spacious
and
irregular
in
form
in
a
hollow
i
found
with
surprise
a
sort
of
bed
carefully
arranged
with
moss
dry
leaves
and
small
twigs
i
was
alarmed
was
this
grotto
inhabited
by
men
or
by
wild
beasts
in
either
case
it
was
dangerous
to
remain
here
i
encouraged
a
hope
however
that
from
the
infant
being
here
the
mother
must
be
the
inhabitant
and
that
on
her
return
finding
me
nursing
her
child
she
might
be
induced
to
share
her
asylum
with
us
i
could
not
however
reconcile
this
hope
with
the
circumstance
of
the
child
being
abandoned
in
this
open
cave
as
i
was
considering
whether
i
ought
to
remain
or
leave
the
cave
i
heard
strange
cries
at
a
distance
mingled
with
the
screams
of
my
children
who
came
running
to
me
for
protection
bringing
with
them
the
young
savage
who
fortunately
was
only
half
awaked
and
soon
went
to
sleep
again
sucking
a
fig
i
laid
him
gently
on
the
bed
of
leaves
and
told
my
daughters
to
remain
near
him
in
a
dark
corner
then
stepping
cautiously
i
ventured
to
look
out
to
discover
what
was
passing
without
being
seen
the
noise
approached
nearer
to
my
great
alarm
and
i
could
perceive
through
the
trees
a
crowd
of
men
armed
with
long
pointed
lances
clubs
and
stones
they
appeared
furious
and
the
idea
that
they
might
enter
the
cave
froze
me
with
terror
i
had
an
idea
of
taking
the
little
native
babe
and
holding
it
in
my
arms
as
my
best
shield
but
this
time
my
fears
were
groundless
the
whole
troop
passed
outside
the
wood
without
even
looking
on
the
same
side
as
the
grotto
they
appeared
to
follow
some
traces
they
were
looking
out
for
on
the
ground
i
heard
their
shouts
for
some
time
but
they
died
away
and
i
recovered
from
my
fears
still
the
dread
of
meeting
them
overcame
even
hunger
i
had
nothing
left
in
my
box
but
some
figs
which
i
kept
for
the
infant
who
was
satisfied
with
them
and
i
told
my
daughters
we
must
go
to
bed
without
supper
the
sleeping
infant
amused
them
so
much
that
they
readily
consented
to
give
up
the
figs
he
awoke
smiling
and
they
gave
him
the
figs
to
suck
in
the
mean
time
i
prepared
to
release
him
from
his
bondage
to
make
him
more
comfortable
and
i
then
saw
that
the
outer
covering
of
bark
was
torn
by
the
teeth
of
some
animal
and
even
the
skin
of
the
child
slightly
grazed
i
ventured
to
carry
him
to
the
brook
into
which
i
plunged
him
two
or
three
times
which
seemed
to
give
him
great
pleasure
i
ran
back
to
the
cave
which
is
you
see
not
more
than
twenty
yards
distant
and
found
sophia
and
matilda
very
much
delighted
at
a
treasure
they
had
found
under
the
dry
leaves
in
a
corner
this
was
a
great
quantity
of
fruits
of
various
kinds
roots
of
some
unknown
plant
and
a
good
supply
of
beautiful
honey
on
which
the
little
gluttons
were
already
feasting
they
came
directly
to
give
some
on
their
fingers
to
their
little
doll
as
they
called
the
babe
this
discovery
made
me
very
thoughtful
was
it
possible
that
we
were
in
a
bear
den
i
had
read
that
they
sometimes
carried
off
infants
and
that
they
were
very
fond
of
fruits
and
of
honey
of
which
they
generally
had
a
hoard
i
remarked
on
the
earth
and
especially
at
the
entrance
where
the
rain
had
made
it
soft
the
impression
of
large
paws
which
left
me
no
doubt
the
animal
would
certainly
return
to
his
den
and
we
were
in
the
greatest
danger
but
where
could
we
go
the
sky
dark
with
clouds
threatened
a
return
of
the
storm
and
the
troop
of
savages
might
still
be
wandering
about
the
island
i
had
not
courage
just
as
night
set
in
to
depart
with
my
children
nor
could
i
leave
the
poor
infant
who
was
now
sleeping
peacefully
after
his
honey
and
figs
his
two
nurses
soon
followed
his
example
but
for
me
there
was
no
rest
the
noise
of
the
wind
among
the
trees
and
of
the
rain
pattering
on
the
leaves
the
murmur
of
the
brook
the
light
bounds
of
the
kangaroo
all
made
my
heart
beat
with
fear
and
terror
i
fancied
it
was
the
bear
returning
to
devour
us
i
had
cut
and
broken
some
branches
to
place
before
the
entrance
but
these
were
but
a
weak
defence
against
a
furious
and
probably
famished
animal
and
if
he
even
did
no
other
harm
to
my
children
i
was
sure
their
terror
at
the
sight
of
him
would
kill
them
i
paced
backwards
and
forwards
from
the
entrance
to
the
bed
in
the
darkness
envying
the
dear
sleepers
their
calm
and
fearless
rest
the
baby
slept
soundly
nestled
warmly
between
my
daughters
till
day
broke
at
last
without
anything
terrible
occurring
then
my
little
people
awoke
and
cried
out
with
hunger
we
ate
of
the
fruits
and
honey
brought
us
by
our
unknown
friend
feeding
also
our
little
charge
to
whom
my
daughters
gave
the
pet
name
of
which
he
still
keeps
i
busied
myself
with
his
there
was
no
need
to
go
to
the
brook
for
a
bath
for
the
rain
came
down
incessantly
i
then
folded
matilda
apron
round
him
which
pleased
her
greatly
the
rain
ceased
for
a
while
and
they
set
off
for
flowers
to
amuse
him
they
were
scarcely
gone
when
i
heard
the
cries
of
the
savages
again
but
this
time
they
seemed
rather
shouts
of
joy
and
triumph
they
sung
and
chaunted
a
sort
of
chorus
but
were
still
at
such
distance
that
i
had
time
to
recal
my
daughters
and
withdrew
them
out
of
sight
i
took
with
me
as
a
mediator
and
placed
myself
in
an
angle
of
the
rock
where
i
could
see
without
being
seen
they
passed
as
before
beyond
the
wood
armed
and
two
of
them
bore
at
the
end
of
their
lances
something
very
large
and
dark
which
i
could
not
distinguish
but
thought
might
be
some
wild
beast
they
had
destroyed
afterwards
i
flattered
myself
it
might
be
the
bear
whose
return
i
so
greatly
dreaded
following
the
train
was
a
woman
naked
with
her
hair
hanging
down
uttering
loud
cries
and
tearing
her
face
and
breast
no
one
attempted
to
soothe
her
but
occasionally
one
of
the
bearers
of
the
black
mass
pointed
it
out
to
her
she
then
became
furious
threw
herself
on
it
and
tried
to
tear
it
with
her
teeth
and
nails
i
was
quite
overcome
with
horror
and
pity
that
woman
my
friends
was
canda
whom
you
have
just
seen
canda
usually
so
mild
and
gentle
was
rendered
frantic
by
the
loss
of
her
child
her
whom
she
believed
was
devoured
by
the
bear
parabéry
her
husband
tried
to
console
her
but
was
himself
in
great
sorrow
these
bears
as
i
have
since
learnt
for
there
were
two
of
them
had
come
from
a
mountain
at
the
foot
of
which
was
parabéry
hut
they
had
only
this
son
and
canda
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
tying
it
in
a
piece
of
bark
carried
it
on
her
back
one
morning
after
having
bathed
him
in
the
stream
which
has
its
source
near
their
abode
she
placed
him
on
the
turf
a
few
moments
while
she
was
employed
in
some
household
duties
she
soon
heard
his
cries
mingled
with
a
sort
of
growl
she
ran
to
the
spot
and
saw
a
frightful
beast
holding
her
child
in
its
mouth
and
running
off
with
it
it
was
then
more
than
twenty
yards
off
her
cries
brought
her
husband
she
pointed
to
the
horrible
animal
and
darted
after
it
determined
to
save
her
child
or
perish
her
husband
only
stopped
to
seize
his
javelin
and
followed
her
but
did
not
overtake
her
till
fatigue
and
the
heat
of
the
day
made
her
fall
almost
senseless
on
the
ground
stopping
for
a
moment
to
raise
and
encourage
her
he
lost
sight
of
the
bear
and
could
not
recover
the
track
all
the
night
that
dreadful
night
of
rain
when
i
was
weeping
and
murmuring
thinking
myself
the
most
unfortunate
of
women
was
canda
exposed
without
clothes
to
that
frightful
storm
hopelessly
seeking
her
only
child
and
not
even
feeling
that
it
did
rain
parabéry
not
less
afflicted
but
more
composed
went
to
relate
his
misfortune
to
his
neighbours
who
arming
themselves
set
out
with
parabéry
at
their
head
following
the
track
of
the
animal
over
the
wet
ground
they
discovered
it
next
morning
with
another
bear
so
busy
devouring
a
swarm
of
bees
and
their
honey
that
the
savages
were
able
to
draw
near
them
parabéry
pierced
one
with
his
spear
and
despatched
him
with
a
blow
of
his
club
one
of
his
comrades
killed
the
other
and
parabéry
tasted
the
truly
savage
joy
of
vengeance
but
the
poor
mother
could
not
be
so
comforted
after
wandering
through
the
rain
all
night
she
reached
the
party
as
they
were
skinning
the
bear
and
dividing
the
flesh
parabéry
only
asked
and
obtained
the
skins
to
recompense
him
for
the
loss
of
his
son
they
returned
home
in
triumph
canda
following
them
with
bitter
cries
tearing
her
face
with
a
shark
tooth
from
observation
of
these
circumstances
i
concluded
that
canda
must
be
the
mother
of
my
little
my
heart
sympathized
with
her
and
i
even
made
some
steps
forward
to
restore
him
but
the
sight
of
the
savage
crowd
with
their
tattooed
bodies
filled
me
with
such
terror
that
i
retreated
involuntarily
to
the
grotto
where
my
children
alarmed
by
the
noise
were
hiding
themselves
do
the
people
cry
out
so
said
sophia
frighten
me
let
them
come
here
mamma
or
they
may
carry
minou
away
said
i
i
should
have
no
right
to
forbid
them
i
think
they
are
his
friends
who
are
distressed
at
losing
him
i
wish
i
could
restore
him
to
them
no
mamma
said
matilda
do
give
him
back
we
like
him
so
much
and
we
will
be
his
little
mammas
he
will
be
far
happier
with
us
than
with
those
ugly
savages
who
tied
him
up
like
a
parcel
in
the
bark
with
the
moss
which
pricked
him
so
much
he
is
much
more
comfortable
in
my
apron
how
he
moves
his
legs
as
if
he
wanted
to
walk
sophia
and
i
will
teach
him
do
let
us
keep
him
mimi
even
if
i
had
decided
it
was
now
too
late
the
savages
had
passed
on
to
some
distance
i
however
explained
to
matilda
the
beauty
of
the
divine
precept
unto
others
as
you
would
they
should
do
unto
you
asking
her
how
she
would
have
liked
to
be
detained
by
the
savages
and
what
then
would
be
the
suffering
of
her
own
mamma
she
was
thoughtful
for
a
moment
and
then
embracing
minou
and
me
are
right
mamma
mimi
but
if
she
loves
her
baby
let
her
come
and
seek
him
said
the
little
rebel
in
the
mean
time
sophia
had
been
out
and
returned
with
some
brilliant
flowers
fresh
after
the
rain
with
which
they
made
garlands
to
dress
up
the
infant
if
his
mamma
saw
him
she
would
be
glad
to
let
us
have
him
said
matilda
she
then
explained
to
her
sister
who
this
mamma
was
and
sophia
shed
tears
to
think
of
the
sorrow
of
the
poor
mother
how
do
you
know
mamma
that
she
was
minou
mother
demanded
she
this
question
proved
that
her
judgment
was
forming
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
teaching
her
what
information
one
may
derive
from
observation
she
understood
me
very
well
and
when
i
told
her
on
what
i
had
founded
my
idea
she
trembled
to
think
he
had
been
brought
here
by
a
bear
and
asked
me
if
the
bear
would
have
eaten
him
can
not
answer
for
it
said
i
it
had
been
pressed
by
hunger
they
tell
us
that
the
bear
does
no
harm
to
man
unless
attacked
and
is
especially
fond
of
children
but
notwithstanding
this
i
should
not
like
to
trust
it
at
all
events
the
poor
babe
would
have
died
if
we
had
not
found
him
babe
he
shall
not
die
of
hunger
now
said
she
us
give
him
some
figs
but
these
are
not
good
we
must
go
and
seek
some
more
the
rain
having
ceased
i
consented
passing
through
the
grove
where
there
are
no
to
search
farther
my
daughters
had
fed
the
child
with
honey
and
water
it
appeared
quite
reconciled
to
us
and
had
ceased
to
cry
i
judged
it
might
be
about
eight
months
old
we
soon
found
some
trees
covered
with
the
figs
whilst
i
gathered
them
the
girls
made
a
pretty
bed
of
moss
adorned
with
flowers
for
their
little
favourite
and
fed
him
with
the
fresh
fruit
which
he
enjoyed
much
and
with
their
fair
hair
and
rosy
faces
and
the
little
negro
between
them
with
his
arch
dark
countenance
they
formed
a
charming
picture
which
affected
me
greatly
chapter
lvi
we
had
been
more
than
an
hour
under
the
tree
when
i
heard
cries
again
but
this
time
i
was
not
alarmed
for
i
distinguished
the
voice
of
the
disconsolate
mother
and
i
knew
that
i
could
comfort
her
her
grief
brought
her
back
to
the
spot
where
she
thought
her
child
had
been
devoured
she
wished
as
she
afterwards
told
us
when
we
could
understand
her
to
search
for
some
remains
of
him
his
hair
his
bones
or
even
a
piece
of
the
bark
that
bound
him
and
here
he
was
full
of
life
and
health
she
advanced
slowly
sobbing
and
her
eyes
turned
to
the
ground
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
search
that
she
did
not
see
us
when
we
were
but
twenty
yards
from
her
suddenly
sophia
darted
like
an
arrow
to
her
took
her
hand
and
said
minou
is
here
canda
neither
knew
what
she
saw
nor
what
she
heard
she
took
my
daughter
for
something
supernatural
and
made
no
resistance
but
followed
her
to
the
even
then
she
did
not
recognize
the
little
creature
released
from
his
bonds
covered
with
flowers
and
surrounded
by
three
divinities
for
she
took
us
for
such
and
wished
to
prostrate
herself
before
us
she
was
still
more
convinced
of
it
when
i
took
up
her
son
and
placed
him
in
her
arms
she
recognized
him
and
the
poor
little
infant
held
out
his
arms
to
her
i
can
never
express
to
you
the
transport
of
the
mother
she
screamed
clasped
her
child
till
he
was
rapidly
repeating
words
which
we
could
not
understand
wept
laughed
and
was
in
a
delirium
of
delight
that
terrified
minou
he
began
to
cry
and
held
out
his
arms
to
sophia
who
as
well
as
matilda
was
weeping
at
the
sight
canda
looked
at
them
with
astonishment
she
soothed
the
child
and
put
him
to
her
breast
which
he
rejected
at
first
but
finally
seized
it
and
his
mother
was
happy
i
took
the
opportunity
to
try
and
make
her
comprehend
that
the
great
animal
had
brought
him
here
that
we
had
found
him
and
taken
care
of
him
and
i
made
signs
for
her
to
follow
me
which
she
did
without
hesitation
till
we
reached
the
grotto
when
without
entering
she
fled
away
with
her
infant
with
such
rapidity
that
it
was
impossible
to
overtake
her
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
i
had
some
difficulty
in
consoling
my
daughters
for
the
loss
of
minou
they
thought
they
should
see
him
no
more
and
that
his
mother
was
very
ungrateful
to
carry
him
off
without
even
letting
them
take
leave
of
him
they
were
still
weeping
and
complaining
when
we
saw
the
objects
of
our
anxiety
approaching
but
canda
was
now
accompanied
by
a
man
who
was
carrying
the
child
they
entered
the
grotto
and
prostrated
themselves
before
us
you
know
parabéry
his
countenance
pleased
and
tranquillized
us
as
a
relation
of
the
king
he
was
distinguished
by
wearing
a
short
tunic
of
leaves
his
body
was
tattooed
and
stained
with
various
colours
but
not
his
face
which
expressed
kindness
and
gratitude
united
with
great
intelligence
he
comprehended
most
of
my
signs
i
did
not
succeed
so
well
in
understanding
him
but
saw
he
meant
kindly
in
the
mean
time
my
daughters
had
a
more
intelligible
conversation
with
canda
and
minou
they
the
latter
with
caresses
fed
him
with
figs
and
honey
and
amused
him
so
much
that
he
would
scarcely
leave
them
canda
was
not
jealous
of
this
preference
but
seemed
delighted
with
it
she
in
her
turn
caressed
my
daughters
admired
their
glossy
hair
and
fair
skin
and
pointed
them
out
to
her
husband
she
repeated
minou
after
them
but
always
added
another
and
appeared
to
think
this
name
beautiful
after
some
words
with
parabéry
she
placed
in
sophia
arms
and
they
both
departed
making
signs
that
they
would
return
but
we
did
not
see
them
for
some
time
after
sophia
and
matilda
had
their
full
enjoyment
of
their
favourite
they
wished
to
teach
him
to
walk
and
to
speak
and
they
assured
me
he
was
making
great
progress
they
were
beginning
to
hope
his
parents
had
left
him
entirely
when
they
came
in
sight
parabéry
bending
under
the
weight
of
two
and
a
beautiful
piece
of
matting
to
close
the
entrance
to
my
grotto
canda
carried
a
basket
on
her
head
filled
with
fine
fruit
the
cocoa
the
which
they
call
figs
and
finally
a
piece
of
bear
flesh
roasted
at
the
fire
which
i
did
not
like
but
i
enjoyed
the
fruits
and
the
milk
of
the
of
which
had
a
good
share
they
spread
the
in
the
midst
of
the
grotto
parabéry
canda
and
the
infant
between
them
took
possession
of
one
without
ceremony
and
motioned
to
us
to
make
our
bed
of
the
other
but
the
bears
having
only
been
killed
the
evening
before
these
skins
had
an
intolerable
smell
i
made
them
comprehend
this
and
parabéry
immediately
carried
them
off
and
placed
them
in
the
brook
secured
by
stones
he
brought
us
in
exchange
a
heap
of
moss
and
leaves
on
which
we
slept
very
well
from
this
moment
we
became
one
family
canda
remained
with
us
and
repaid
to
my
daughters
all
the
care
and
affection
they
bestowed
on
there
never
was
a
child
had
more
indulgence
but
he
deserved
it
for
his
quickness
and
docility
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
he
began
to
lisp
a
few
words
of
german
as
well
as
his
mother
of
whom
i
was
the
teacher
and
who
made
rapid
progress
parabéry
was
very
little
with
us
but
he
undertook
to
be
our
purveyor
and
furnished
us
abundantly
with
everything
necessary
for
our
subsistence
canda
taught
my
daughter
to
make
beautiful
baskets
some
of
a
flat
form
served
for
our
plates
and
dishes
parabéry
made
us
knives
from
sharp
stones
my
daughters
in
return
taught
canda
to
sew
at
the
time
of
our
shipwreck
we
had
each
of
us
in
her
pocket
a
morocco
housewife
with
a
store
of
needles
and
thread
by
means
of
these
we
had
mended
our
linen
and
we
now
made
dresses
of
the
washed
in
the
stream
and
thoroughly
dried
in
the
burning
sun
have
been
very
useful
to
us
in
the
cold
and
rainy
season
now
that
we
had
guides
we
made
in
the
fine
season
excursions
to
different
parts
of
the
island
soon
learned
to
walk
and
being
strong
like
all
these
islanders
would
always
accompany
us
we
went
one
day
to
the
i
shuddered
at
the
sight
and
canda
who
knew
that
my
husband
and
child
had
perished
in
the
sea
wept
with
me
we
now
spoke
each
other
language
well
enough
to
converse
she
told
me
that
a
emily
bowed
to
willis
had
arrived
in
a
neighbouring
island
to
announce
to
them
that
there
was
a
being
almighty
and
who
lived
in
heaven
and
heard
all
they
said
her
comprehension
of
this
truth
was
very
confused
and
i
endeavoured
to
make
it
more
clear
and
positive
see
very
well
said
she
you
know
him
is
it
to
him
that
you
speak
every
morning
and
evening
kneeling
as
we
do
before
our
king
canda
said
i
is
before
him
who
is
the
king
of
kings
who
gave
us
our
life
who
preserves
it
and
bestows
on
us
all
good
and
who
promises
us
still
more
when
this
life
is
past
it
he
who
charged
you
to
take
care
of
and
to
restore
him
to
me
asked
she
canda
all
that
you
or
i
do
that
is
good
is
put
into
our
hearts
by
him
i
thus
tried
to
prepare
the
simple
mind
of
canda
for
the
great
truths
that
willis
was
to
teach
her
you
left
me
little
to
do
said
willis
i
found
parabéry
and
canda
prepared
to
believe
with
sincere
faith
the
holy
religion
i
came
to
teach
the
god
of
the
white
people
was
the
only
one
they
adored
i
knew
parabéry
he
had
come
to
hunt
seals
in
the
island
where
i
was
established
and
i
was
struck
by
his
appearance
what
was
my
astonishment
to
find
that
when
i
spoke
to
him
of
the
one
true
god
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
subject
he
had
even
some
ideas
of
a
saviour
and
of
future
rewards
and
punishments
was
the
white
lady
said
he
taught
me
this
she
teaches
canda
and
whose
life
she
saved
and
whom
she
is
bringing
up
to
be
good
like
herself
i
had
a
great
desire
continued
willis
to
become
acquainted
with
my
powerful
assistant
in
the
great
work
of
my
mission
i
told
parabéry
this
who
offered
to
bring
me
here
in
his
canoe
i
came
and
found
in
a
miserable
cave
or
rather
in
a
bear
den
all
the
virtues
of
mature
age
united
to
the
charms
of
youth
a
resigned
and
pious
mother
bringing
up
her
children
as
women
should
be
brought
up
in
simplicity
forbearance
and
love
of
industry
teaching
them
as
the
best
knowledge
to
love
god
with
all
their
heart
and
their
neighbour
as
themselves
under
the
inspection
of
their
mother
they
were
educating
the
son
of
parabéry
this
child
then
four
years
and
a
half
old
spoke
german
well
and
knew
his
alphabet
which
madame
hirtel
traced
on
the
floor
of
the
grotto
in
this
way
she
taught
her
daughters
to
read
they
taught
who
in
his
turn
teaches
his
parents
parabéry
often
brings
his
friends
to
the
grotto
and
madame
hirtel
having
acquired
the
language
casts
into
their
hearts
the
good
seed
which
i
venture
to
hope
will
not
be
unfruitful
finding
these
people
in
such
a
good
state
and
wishing
to
enjoy
the
society
of
a
family
like
myself
banished
to
a
remote
region
i
decided
to
take
up
my
abode
in
this
island
parabéry
soon
built
me
a
hut
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
grotto
madame
hirtel
compelled
me
to
take
one
of
her
i
have
by
degrees
formed
my
establishment
dividing
with
my
worthy
neighbour
the
few
useful
articles
i
brought
from
europe
and
we
live
a
tranquil
and
happy
life
and
now
comes
the
time
that
brought
about
our
meeting
some
of
our
islanders
in
a
fishing
expedition
were
driven
by
the
wind
on
your
island
at
the
entrance
of
a
large
bay
they
found
a
small
canoe
of
bark
carefully
moored
to
a
tree
either
their
innate
propensity
for
theft
or
the
notion
that
it
had
no
owner
prevailed
over
them
and
they
brought
it
away
i
was
informed
of
this
and
was
curious
to
see
it
i
recognized
at
once
that
it
was
made
by
europeans
the
careful
finish
the
neat
form
the
oars
rudder
mast
and
triangular
sail
all
showed
that
it
had
not
been
made
by
savages
the
seats
of
the
rowers
were
made
of
planks
and
were
painted
and
what
further
convinced
me
was
that
i
found
in
it
a
capital
gun
loaded
and
a
horn
of
powder
in
a
hole
under
one
of
the
seats
i
then
made
particular
inquiries
about
the
island
from
whence
they
had
brought
the
canoe
and
all
their
answers
confirmed
my
idea
that
it
must
be
inhabited
by
a
european
from
whom
they
had
perhaps
taken
his
only
means
of
leaving
it
restless
about
this
fancy
i
tried
to
persuade
them
to
return
and
discover
if
the
island
was
inhabited
i
could
not
prevail
on
them
to
restore
the
canoe
but
seeing
me
much
agitated
they
resolved
secretly
to
procure
me
a
great
pleasure
as
they
thought
by
returning
to
the
island
and
bringing
away
any
one
they
could
meet
with
whether
he
would
or
not
parabéry
always
the
leader
in
perilous
enterprises
and
who
was
so
attached
to
me
would
not
be
left
out
in
one
which
was
to
produce
me
such
pleasure
they
set
out
and
you
know
the
result
of
their
expedition
i
leave
it
to
your
wife
to
tell
you
how
she
was
brought
away
and
pass
on
to
the
time
of
their
arrival
my
people
brought
them
to
me
in
triumph
and
were
vexed
that
they
had
only
found
one
woman
and
a
child
whom
i
might
give
to
the
white
lady
this
i
did
promptly
your
wife
was
ill
and
distressed
and
i
carried
her
immediately
to
the
grotto
there
she
found
a
companion
who
welcomed
her
with
joy
francis
replaced
her
own
lost
alfred
and
the
two
good
mothers
were
soon
intimate
friends
but
notwithstanding
this
solace
your
elizabeth
was
inconsolable
at
the
separation
from
her
husband
and
children
and
terrified
at
the
danger
to
which
you
would
expose
yourself
in
searching
for
her
we
were
even
afraid
she
would
lose
her
reason
when
the
king
came
to
take
away
francis
he
had
seen
him
on
his
arrival
and
was
much
taken
with
his
appearance
he
came
again
to
see
him
and
resolved
to
adopt
him
as
his
son
you
know
what
passed
on
this
subject
and
now
you
are
once
more
united
to
all
those
who
are
dear
to
you
bless
god
brother
who
knows
how
to
produce
good
from
what
we
think
evil
and
acknowledge
the
wisdom
of
his
ways
you
must
return
all
together
to
your
island
i
am
too
much
interested
in
the
happiness
of
emily
to
wish
to
detain
her
and
if
god
permits
me
when
my
missions
are
completed
i
will
come
to
end
my
days
with
you
and
to
bless
your
rising
colony
i
suppress
all
our
reflections
on
this
interesting
history
and
our
gratitude
for
the
termination
of
our
trials
and
hasten
to
the
recital
which
at
my
particular
entreaty
my
wife
proceeded
to
give
us
chapter
lvii
my
story
she
began
will
not
be
long
i
might
make
it
in
two
words
have
lost
me
and
you
have
found
i
have
every
reason
to
thank
heaven
for
a
circumstance
which
has
proved
to
me
how
dear
i
am
to
you
and
has
given
me
the
happiness
of
gaining
a
friend
and
two
dear
daughters
can
one
complain
of
an
event
which
has
produced
such
consequences
even
though
it
was
attended
with
some
violence
but
i
ought
to
do
the
savages
justice
this
violence
was
as
gentle
as
it
could
be
i
need
only
tell
you
parabéry
was
there
to
convince
you
i
was
well
treated
and
it
was
solely
the
sorrow
of
being
parted
from
you
that
affected
my
health
i
shall
be
well
now
and
as
soon
as
jack
can
walk
i
shall
be
ready
to
embark
for
our
happy
island
i
will
now
tell
you
how
i
was
brought
away
when
you
and
our
three
sons
left
to
make
the
tour
of
the
island
i
was
very
comfortable
you
had
told
me
you
might
return
late
or
probably
not
till
next
day
and
when
the
evening
passed
away
without
seeing
you
i
was
not
uneasy
francis
was
constantly
with
me
we
went
together
to
water
the
garden
and
rested
in
the
grotto
ernestine
then
i
returned
to
the
house
took
my
wheel
and
placed
myself
in
my
favourite
colonnade
where
i
should
be
the
first
to
see
your
return
francis
seeing
me
at
work
asked
if
he
might
go
as
far
as
the
bridge
to
meet
you
to
which
i
readily
consented
he
set
out
and
i
was
sitting
thinking
of
the
pleasure
i
should
have
in
seeing
you
again
and
hearing
you
relate
your
voyage
when
i
saw
francis
running
crying
out
mamma
there
is
a
canoe
on
the
sea
i
know
it
is
ours
it
is
full
of
men
perhaps
savages
little
fellow
said
i
is
your
father
and
brothers
if
they
are
in
the
canoe
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
your
father
told
me
he
would
bring
it
and
they
would
return
by
water
i
had
forgotten
this
when
i
let
you
go
now
you
can
go
and
meet
them
on
the
shore
give
me
your
arm
and
i
will
go
too
and
we
set
off
very
joyfully
to
meet
our
captors
i
soon
alas
saw
my
error
it
was
indeed
our
canoe
but
instead
of
my
dear
ones
there
were
in
it
six
savages
with
terrible
countenances
who
landed
and
surrounded
us
my
blood
froze
with
fright
and
if
i
had
wished
to
flee
i
was
unable
i
fell
on
the
shore
nearly
insensible
still
i
heard
the
cries
of
my
dear
francis
who
clung
to
me
and
held
me
with
all
his
strength
at
last
my
senses
quite
failed
me
and
i
only
recovered
to
find
myself
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
my
son
weeping
over
me
was
trying
to
recover
me
assisted
by
one
of
the
savages
of
less
repulsive
appearance
than
his
companions
and
who
seemed
the
chief
this
was
parabéry
he
made
me
swallow
a
few
drops
of
a
detestable
fermented
liquor
which
however
restored
me
i
felt
as
i
recovered
the
extent
of
my
disaster
and
your
grief
my
dears
when
you
should
find
me
missing
i
should
have
been
wholly
disconsolate
but
that
francis
was
left
to
me
and
he
was
continually
praying
me
to
live
for
his
sake
i
received
some
comfort
from
a
vague
notion
that
as
this
was
our
canoe
the
savages
had
already
carried
you
off
and
were
taking
us
to
you
i
was
confirmed
in
this
hope
when
i
saw
that
the
savages
instead
of
making
to
sea
continued
to
coast
the
island
till
they
came
to
the
great
bay
i
had
then
no
doubt
but
that
we
should
meet
with
you
but
this
hope
was
soon
destroyed
two
or
three
more
of
the
savages
were
waiting
there
on
the
shore
they
spoke
to
their
friends
in
the
canoe
and
i
understood
from
their
gestures
that
they
were
saying
they
could
not
find
anybody
there
i
have
since
learnt
from
canda
that
part
of
them
landed
at
the
great
bay
with
instructions
to
search
that
side
of
the
island
for
inhabitants
whilst
the
rest
proceeded
with
the
canoe
to
examine
the
other
side
and
had
succeeded
but
too
well
the
night
came
on
and
they
were
anxious
to
return
which
doubtless
prevented
them
pillaging
our
house
i
believe
moreover
that
none
of
them
could
have
reached
tent
house
defended
by
our
strong
palisade
and
hidden
by
the
rocks
amidst
which
it
is
built
and
the
other
party
finding
us
on
the
shore
would
not
penetrate
further
illustration
six
savages
with
terrible
countenances
landed
and
surrounded
us
when
all
had
entered
the
canoe
they
pushed
off
by
the
light
of
the
stars
into
the
open
sea
i
think
i
must
have
sunk
under
my
sorrow
but
for
francis
and
i
must
confess
it
my
dear
dog
flora
who
had
never
left
me
francis
told
me
that
she
had
tried
to
defend
me
and
flew
at
the
savages
but
one
of
them
took
my
apron
tore
it
and
tied
it
over
her
mouth
like
a
muzzle
bound
her
legs
and
then
threw
her
into
the
canoe
where
the
poor
creature
lay
at
my
feet
moaning
piteously
she
arrived
with
us
in
this
island
but
i
have
not
seen
her
since
i
have
often
inquired
of
parabéry
but
he
could
not
tell
me
what
had
become
of
her
but
i
know
said
fritz
and
have
seen
her
we
brought
turk
with
us
and
the
savages
had
carried
flora
to
that
desert
part
of
the
island
from
whence
jack
was
carried
off
so
the
two
dogs
met
when
i
had
the
misfortune
to
wound
jack
i
quite
forgot
them
they
were
rambling
off
in
chase
of
kangaroos
we
left
them
and
no
doubt
they
are
there
still
but
we
must
not
abandon
the
poor
beasts
if
my
father
will
permit
me
i
will
go
and
seek
them
in
parabéry
canoe
as
we
were
obliged
to
wait
a
few
days
for
jack
recovery
i
consented
on
condition
that
parabéry
accompanied
them
and
the
next
day
was
fixed
for
the
expedition
ernest
begged
to
be
of
the
party
that
he
might
see
the
beautiful
trees
and
flowers
they
had
described
i
then
requested
the
narration
might
be
continued
which
had
been
interrupted
by
this
episode
of
the
two
dogs
francis
resumed
it
where
his
mother
had
left
off
we
had
a
favourable
passage
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
boat
went
so
smoothly
that
both
mamma
and
i
went
to
sleep
you
must
have
come
a
much
longer
round
than
necessary
papa
as
your
voyage
lasted
three
days
and
we
arrived
here
the
day
after
our
departure
mamma
was
then
awake
and
wept
constantly
believing
she
should
never
more
see
you
or
my
brothers
parabéry
seemed
very
sorry
for
her
and
tried
to
console
her
at
last
he
addressed
to
her
two
or
three
words
of
german
pointing
to
heaven
his
words
were
very
plain
god
and
then
and
adding
the
words
and
we
did
not
understand
what
he
meant
but
he
seemed
so
pleased
at
speaking
these
words
that
we
could
not
but
be
pleased
too
and
to
hear
him
name
god
in
german
gave
us
confidence
though
we
could
not
comprehend
where
or
how
he
had
learnt
the
words
said
mamma
has
seen
your
papa
and
brothers
i
thought
so
too
still
it
appeared
strange
that
in
so
short
a
time
he
could
acquire
and
remember
these
words
however
it
might
be
mamma
was
delighted
to
have
him
near
her
and
taught
him
to
pronounce
the
words
and
which
did
not
seem
strange
to
him
and
he
soon
knew
them
she
pointed
to
me
and
to
herself
as
she
pronounced
the
words
and
he
readily
comprehended
them
and
said
to
us
with
bursts
of
laughter
showing
his
large
ivory
teeth
mother
son
parabéry
father
white
lady
mamma
thought
he
referred
to
her
but
it
was
to
madame
emily
he
tried
to
pronounce
this
name
and
two
others
but
could
not
succeed
at
last
he
said
and
almost
convinced
us
he
must
know
some
europeans
which
was
a
great
comfort
to
us
when
i
saw
mamma
more
composed
i
took
out
my
flageolet
to
amuse
her
and
played
the
air
to
ernest
verses
this
made
her
weep
again
very
much
and
she
begged
me
to
desist
the
savages
however
wished
me
to
continue
and
i
did
not
know
whom
to
obey
i
changed
the
air
playing
the
merriest
i
knew
they
were
in
ecstasies
they
took
me
in
their
arms
one
after
the
other
saying
i
repeated
the
word
after
them
and
they
were
still
more
delighted
but
mamma
was
so
uneasy
to
see
me
in
their
arms
that
i
broke
from
them
and
returned
to
her
at
last
we
landed
they
carried
mamma
who
was
too
weak
to
walk
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
we
saw
a
large
building
of
wood
and
reeds
before
which
there
was
a
crowd
of
savages
one
who
was
very
tall
came
to
receive
us
he
was
dressed
in
a
short
tunic
much
ornamented
and
wore
a
necklace
of
pierced
shells
he
was
a
little
disfigured
by
a
white
bone
passed
through
his
nostrils
but
you
saw
him
papa
when
he
wanted
to
adopt
me
it
was
the
king
of
the
island
i
was
presented
to
him
and
he
was
pleased
with
me
touched
the
end
of
my
nose
with
his
and
admired
my
hair
very
much
my
conductors
ordered
me
to
play
on
the
flageolet
i
played
some
lively
german
airs
which
made
them
dance
and
leap
till
the
king
fell
down
with
fatigue
and
made
a
sign
for
me
to
desist
he
then
spoke
for
some
time
to
the
savages
who
stood
in
a
circle
round
him
he
looked
at
mamma
who
was
seated
in
a
corner
near
her
protector
parabéry
he
called
the
latter
who
obliged
mamma
to
rise
and
presented
her
to
the
king
looked
only
at
the
red
and
yellow
india
handkerchief
which
she
wore
on
her
head
he
took
it
off
very
unceremoniously
and
put
it
on
his
own
head
saying
which
means
beautiful
he
then
made
us
in
the
canoe
with
him
amusing
himself
with
me
and
my
flageolet
which
he
attempted
to
play
by
blowing
it
through
his
nose
but
did
not
succeed
after
turning
round
a
point
which
seemed
to
divide
the
island
into
two
we
landed
on
a
sandy
beach
parabéry
and
another
savage
proceeded
into
the
interior
carrying
my
mother
and
we
followed
we
arrived
at
a
hut
similar
to
the
king
but
not
so
large
there
we
were
received
by
willis
whom
we
judged
to
be
the
and
from
that
time
we
had
no
more
fears
he
took
us
under
his
protection
first
speaking
to
the
king
and
to
parabéry
in
their
own
language
he
then
addressed
mamma
in
german
mixed
with
a
few
english
words
which
we
understood
very
well
he
knew
nothing
of
you
and
my
brothers
but
from
what
mamma
told
him
he
promised
to
have
you
sought
for
and
brought
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
island
in
the
mean
time
he
offered
to
lead
us
to
a
friend
who
would
take
care
of
us
and
nurse
poor
mamma
who
looked
very
she
was
obliged
to
be
carried
to
the
grotto
but
after
that
her
cares
were
over
and
her
pleasure
without
alloy
for
the
had
promised
to
seek
you
the
received
us
like
old
friends
and
sophia
and
matilda
took
me
at
first
for
their
own
brother
and
still
love
me
as
if
i
was
we
only
wished
for
you
all
madame
mimi
made
mamma
lie
down
on
the
and
prepared
her
a
pleasant
beverage
from
the
milk
of
the
sophia
and
matilda
took
me
to
gather
strawberries
and
figs
and
beautiful
flowers
and
we
caught
fish
in
the
brook
between
two
osier
hurdles
we
amused
ourselves
very
well
with
while
canda
and
madame
emily
amused
mamma
the
king
came
the
next
day
to
see
his
little
favourite
he
wished
me
to
go
with
him
to
another
part
of
the
island
where
he
often
went
to
hunt
but
i
would
not
leave
mamma
and
my
new
friends
i
was
wrong
papa
for
you
were
there
and
my
brothers
it
was
there
jack
was
wounded
and
brought
away
i
might
have
prevented
all
that
and
you
would
then
have
returned
to
us
how
sorry
i
have
been
for
my
obstinacy
it
was
i
more
than
fritz
who
was
the
cause
of
his
being
wounded
returned
in
the
evening
to
the
grotto
and
think
papa
of
our
surprise
our
delight
and
our
distress
when
he
brought
us
poor
jack
wounded
and
in
great
pain
but
still
all
joy
at
finding
us
again
the
king
told
willis
he
was
sure
jack
was
my
brother
and
he
made
us
a
present
of
him
adding
that
he
gave
him
in
exchange
for
handkerchief
mamma
thanked
him
earnestly
and
placed
jack
beside
her
from
him
she
learned
all
you
had
done
to
discover
us
he
informed
willis
where
he
had
left
you
and
he
promised
to
seek
and
bring
you
to
us
he
then
examined
the
wound
which
jack
wished
him
to
think
he
had
himself
caused
with
fritz
gun
but
this
was
not
probable
as
the
ball
had
entered
behind
and
lodged
in
the
shoulder
willis
extracted
it
with
some
difficulty
and
poor
jack
suffered
a
good
deal
but
all
is
now
going
on
well
what
a
large
party
we
shall
be
papa
when
we
are
all
settled
in
our
island
sophia
and
matilda
canda
parabéry
you
papa
and
two
mammas
and
mr
willis
my
wife
smiled
as
the
little
orator
concluded
willis
then
dressed
jack
wound
and
thought
he
might
be
removed
in
five
or
six
days
now
my
dear
jack
said
i
it
is
your
turn
to
relate
your
history
your
brother
left
off
where
you
were
entertaining
the
savages
with
your
buffooneries
and
certainly
they
were
never
better
introduced
but
how
did
they
suddenly
think
of
carrying
you
away
parabéry
told
me
said
jack
that
they
were
struck
with
my
resemblance
to
francis
as
soon
as
i
took
my
flageolet
after
i
had
played
a
minute
or
two
the
savage
who
wore
mamma
handkerchief
whom
i
now
know
to
be
the
king
interrupted
me
by
crying
out
and
clapping
his
hands
he
spoke
earnestly
to
the
others
pointing
to
my
face
and
to
my
flageolet
which
he
had
taken
he
looked
also
at
my
jacket
of
blue
cotton
which
one
of
them
had
tied
round
his
shoulders
like
a
mantle
and
doubtless
he
then
gave
orders
for
me
to
be
carried
to
the
canoe
they
seized
upon
me
i
screamed
like
a
madman
kicked
them
and
scratched
them
but
what
could
i
do
against
seven
or
eight
great
savages
they
tied
my
legs
together
and
my
hands
behind
me
and
carried
me
like
a
parcel
i
could
then
do
nothing
but
cry
out
for
fritz
and
the
knight
of
the
gun
came
rather
too
soon
in
attempting
to
defend
me
some
way
or
other
off
went
his
gun
and
the
ball
took
up
its
abode
in
my
shoulder
i
can
assure
you
an
unpleasant
visitor
is
that
same
ball
but
here
he
is
the
scoundrel
father
willis
pulled
him
out
by
the
same
door
as
that
by
which
he
went
in
and
since
his
departure
all
goes
on
well
now
for
my
story
when
poor
fritz
saw
that
i
was
wounded
he
fell
down
as
if
he
had
been
shot
at
the
same
time
the
savages
thinking
he
was
dead
took
away
his
gun
and
carried
me
into
the
canoe
i
was
in
despair
more
for
the
death
of
my
brother
than
from
my
wound
which
i
almost
forgot
and
was
wishing
they
would
throw
me
into
the
sea
when
i
saw
fritz
running
at
full
speed
to
the
shore
but
we
pushed
off
and
i
could
only
call
out
some
words
of
consolation
the
savages
were
very
kind
to
me
and
one
of
them
held
me
up
seated
on
the
they
washed
my
wound
with
sucked
it
tore
my
to
make
a
bandage
and
as
soon
as
we
landed
squeezed
the
juice
of
some
herb
into
it
we
sailed
very
quickly
and
passed
the
place
where
we
had
landed
in
the
morning
i
knew
it
again
and
could
see
ernest
standing
on
a
he
was
watching
us
and
i
held
out
my
arms
to
him
i
thought
i
also
saw
you
papa
and
heard
you
call
but
the
savages
yelled
and
though
i
cried
with
all
my
strength
it
was
in
vain
i
little
thought
they
were
taking
me
to
mamma
as
soon
as
we
had
disembarked
they
brought
me
to
this
grotto
and
i
thought
i
must
have
died
of
surprise
and
joy
when
i
was
met
by
mamma
and
francis
and
then
by
sophia
matilda
mamma
emily
and
willis
who
is
a
second
father
to
me
this
is
the
end
of
my
story
and
a
very
pretty
end
it
is
that
brings
us
all
together
what
matters
it
to
have
had
a
little
vexation
for
all
this
pleasure
i
owe
it
all
to
you
fritz
if
you
had
let
me
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
instead
of
dragging
me
out
by
the
hair
i
should
not
have
been
here
so
happy
as
i
am
i
am
obliged
to
the
gun
too
thanks
to
it
i
was
the
first
to
reach
mamma
and
see
our
new
friends
the
next
day
fritz
and
ernest
set
out
on
their
expedition
with
parabéry
in
his
canoe
to
seek
our
two
valued
dogs
the
good
islander
carried
his
canoe
on
his
back
to
the
shore
i
saw
them
set
off
but
not
without
some
dread
in
such
a
frail
bark
into
which
the
water
leaked
through
every
seam
but
my
boys
could
swim
well
and
the
kind
skilful
and
bold
parabéry
undertook
to
answer
for
their
safety
i
therefore
recommended
them
to
god
and
returned
to
the
grotto
to
tranquillize
my
wife
fears
jack
was
inconsolable
that
he
could
not
form
one
of
the
party
but
sophia
scolded
him
for
wishing
to
leave
them
to
go
upon
the
sea
which
had
swallowed
up
poor
alfred
in
the
evening
we
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
our
brave
dogs
enter
the
grotto
they
leaped
on
us
in
a
way
that
terrified
the
poor
little
girls
at
first
who
took
them
for
bears
but
they
were
soon
reconciled
to
them
when
they
saw
them
fawn
round
us
lick
our
hands
and
pass
from
one
to
the
other
to
be
caressed
my
sons
had
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
them
they
had
run
to
them
at
the
first
call
and
seemed
delighted
to
see
their
masters
again
the
poor
animals
had
subsisted
on
the
remains
of
the
kangaroos
but
apparently
had
met
with
no
fresh
water
for
they
seemed
dying
with
thirst
and
rushed
to
the
brook
as
soon
as
they
discovered
it
and
returned
again
and
again
then
they
followed
us
to
the
hut
of
the
good
missionary
who
had
been
engaged
all
day
in
visiting
the
dwellings
of
the
natives
and
teaching
them
the
truths
of
religion
i
had
accompanied
him
but
from
ignorance
of
the
language
could
not
aid
him
i
was
however
delighted
with
the
simple
and
earnest
manner
in
which
he
spoke
and
the
eagerness
with
which
they
heard
him
he
finished
by
a
prayer
kneeling
and
they
all
imitated
him
lifting
up
their
hands
and
eyes
to
heaven
he
told
me
he
was
trying
to
make
them
celebrate
the
sunday
he
assembled
them
in
his
tent
which
he
wished
to
make
a
temple
for
the
worship
of
the
true
god
he
intended
to
consecrate
it
for
this
purpose
and
to
live
in
the
grotto
after
our
departure
the
day
arrived
at
last
jack
shoulder
was
nearly
healed
and
my
wife
along
with
her
happiness
recovered
her
strength
the
pinnace
had
been
so
well
guarded
by
parabéry
and
his
friends
that
it
suffered
no
injury
i
distributed
among
the
islanders
everything
i
had
that
could
please
them
and
made
parabéry
invite
them
to
come
and
see
us
in
our
island
requesting
we
might
live
on
friendly
terms
willis
wished
much
to
see
it
and
to
complete
our
happiness
he
promised
to
accompany
and
spend
some
days
with
us
and
parabéry
said
he
would
take
him
back
when
he
wished
it
we
embarked
then
after
taking
leave
of
who
was
very
liberal
in
his
presents
giving
us
besides
fruits
of
every
kind
a
whole
hog
roasted
which
was
excellent
we
were
fourteen
in
number
sixteen
reckoning
the
two
dogs
the
missionary
accompanied
us
and
a
young
islander
whom
parabéry
had
procured
to
be
his
servant
as
he
was
too
old
and
too
much
occupied
with
his
mission
to
attend
to
his
own
wants
this
youth
was
of
a
good
disposition
and
much
attached
to
him
parabéry
took
him
to
assist
in
rowing
when
he
returned
emily
could
not
but
feel
rather
affected
at
leaving
the
grotto
where
she
had
passed
four
tranquil
if
not
happy
years
fulfilling
the
duties
of
a
mother
neither
could
she
avoid
a
painful
sensation
when
she
once
more
saw
the
sea
that
had
been
so
fatal
to
her
husband
and
son
she
could
scarcely
subdue
the
fear
she
had
of
trusting
all
she
had
left
to
that
treacherous
element
she
held
her
daughters
in
her
arms
and
prayed
for
the
protection
of
heaven
willis
and
i
spoke
to
her
of
the
goodness
of
god
and
pointed
out
to
her
the
calmness
of
the
water
the
security
of
the
pinnace
and
the
favourable
state
of
the
wind
my
wife
described
to
her
our
establishment
and
promised
her
a
far
more
beautiful
grotto
than
the
one
she
had
left
and
at
last
she
became
more
reconciled
after
seven
or
eight
hours
voyage
we
arrived
at
cape
disappointment
and
we
agreed
the
bay
should
henceforth
be
called
the
bay
of
the
happy
return
the
distance
to
tent
house
from
hence
was
much
too
great
for
the
ladies
and
children
to
go
on
foot
my
intention
was
to
take
them
by
water
to
the
other
end
of
the
island
near
our
house
but
my
elder
sons
had
begged
to
be
landed
at
the
bay
to
seek
their
live
stock
and
take
them
home
i
left
them
there
with
parabéry
jack
recommended
his
buffalo
to
them
and
francis
his
bull
and
all
were
found
we
coasted
the
island
arrived
at
safety
bay
and
were
soon
at
tent
house
where
we
found
all
as
we
had
left
it
in
good
condition
notwithstanding
the
description
my
wife
had
given
them
our
new
guests
found
our
establishment
far
beyond
their
expectation
with
what
delight
jack
and
francis
ran
up
and
down
the
colonnade
with
their
young
friends
what
stories
they
had
to
tell
of
all
the
surprises
they
had
prepared
for
their
mother
they
showed
them
the
and
gave
their
friends
water
from
their
beautiful
fountain
absence
seemed
to
have
improved
everything
and
i
must
confess
i
had
some
difficulty
to
refrain
from
demonstrating
my
joy
as
wildly
as
my
children
parabéry
and
canda
were
lost
in
admiration
calling
out
continually
beautiful
my
wife
was
busied
in
arranging
a
temporary
lodging
for
our
guests
the
was
given
up
to
willis
my
wife
and
madame
emily
had
our
apartment
the
two
little
girls
being
with
them
to
whom
the
hammocks
of
the
elder
boys
were
appropriated
canda
who
knew
nothing
about
beds
was
wonderfully
comfortable
on
the
carpet
fritz
ernest
and
the
two
natives
stowed
themselves
wherever
they
wished
in
the
colonnade
or
in
the
kitchen
all
was
alike
to
them
i
slept
on
moss
and
cotton
in
willis
room
with
my
two
younger
sons
every
one
was
content
waiting
till
our
ulterior
arrangements
were
completed
conclusion
i
must
conclude
my
journal
here
we
can
scarcely
be
more
happy
than
we
are
and
i
feel
no
cares
about
my
children
fritz
is
so
fond
of
the
chase
and
of
mechanics
and
ernest
of
study
that
they
will
not
wish
to
marry
but
i
please
myself
by
hoping
at
some
time
to
see
my
dear
jack
and
francis
happily
united
to
sophia
and
matilda
what
remains
for
me
to
tell
the
details
of
happiness
however
sweet
in
enjoyment
are
often
tedious
in
recital
i
will
only
add
that
after
passing
a
few
days
with
us
willis
returned
to
his
charge
promising
to
visit
us
and
eventually
to
join
us
the
grotto
ernestine
fitted
up
by
fritz
and
parabéry
made
a
pretty
abode
for
madame
hirtel
and
her
daughters
and
the
two
islanders
did
not
leave
his
young
mammas
and
was
very
useful
to
them
i
must
state
also
that
my
son
ernest
without
abandoning
the
study
of
natural
history
applied
himself
to
astronomy
and
mounted
the
large
telescope
belonging
to
the
ship
he
acquired
considerable
knowledge
of
this
sublime
science
which
his
mother
however
considered
somewhat
useless
the
course
of
the
other
planets
did
not
interest
her
so
long
as
all
went
on
well
in
that
which
she
inhabited
and
nothing
now
was
wanting
to
her
happiness
surrounded
as
she
was
by
friends
the
following
year
we
had
a
visit
from
a
russian
vessel
the
commanded
by
captain
krusenstern
a
countryman
and
distant
relation
of
mine
the
celebrated
horner
of
zurich
accompanied
him
as
astronomer
having
read
the
first
part
of
our
journal
sent
into
europe
by
captain
johnson
he
had
come
purposely
to
see
us
delighted
with
our
establishment
he
did
not
advise
us
to
quit
it
captain
krusenstern
invited
us
to
take
a
passage
in
his
vessel
we
declined
his
offer
but
my
wife
though
she
renounced
her
country
for
ever
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
making
inquiries
about
her
relations
and
friends
as
she
had
concluded
her
good
mother
had
died
some
years
before
blessing
her
absent
children
my
wife
shed
some
tears
but
was
consoled
by
the
certainty
of
her
mother
eternal
felicity
and
the
hope
of
their
meeting
in
futurity
one
of
her
brothers
was
also
dead
he
had
left
a
daughter
to
whom
my
wife
had
always
been
attached
though
she
was
very
young
when
we
left
henrietta
bodmer
was
now
sixteen
and
horner
assured
us
a
most
amiable
girl
my
wife
wished
much
to
have
her
with
us
ernest
would
not
leave
horner
a
moment
he
was
so
delighted
to
meet
with
one
so
eminently
skilful
in
his
favourite
science
astronomy
made
them
such
friends
that
horner
petitioned
me
to
allow
him
to
take
my
son
to
europe
promising
to
bring
him
back
himself
in
a
few
years
this
was
a
great
trial
to
us
but
i
felt
that
his
taste
for
science
required
a
larger
field
than
our
island
his
mother
was
reluctant
to
part
with
him
but
consoled
herself
with
a
notion
that
he
might
bring
his
cousin
henrietta
back
with
him
many
tears
were
shed
at
our
parting
indeed
the
grief
of
his
mother
was
so
intense
that
my
son
seemed
almost
inclined
to
give
up
his
inclination
but
horner
made
some
observations
about
the
transit
of
venus
so
interesting
that
ernest
could
not
resist
he
left
us
promising
to
bring
us
back
everything
we
wished
for
in
the
mean
time
captain
krusenstern
left
us
a
good
supply
of
powder
provisions
seeds
and
some
capital
tools
to
the
great
delight
of
fritz
and
jack
they
regretted
their
brother
greatly
but
diverted
their
minds
from
sorrow
by
application
to
mechanics
assisted
by
the
intelligent
parabéry
they
have
already
succeeded
in
constructing
near
the
cascade
a
and
a
and
have
built
a
very
good
oven
we
miss
ernest
very
much
though
his
taste
for
study
withdrew
him
a
good
deal
from
us
and
he
was
not
so
useful
as
his
brothers
we
found
his
calm
and
considerate
advice
often
of
value
and
his
mildness
always
spread
a
charm
over
our
circle
in
joy
or
in
trouble
except
this
little
affliction
we
are
very
happy
our
labours
are
divided
regularly
fritz
and
jack
manage
the
board
of
works
they
have
opened
a
passage
through
the
rock
which
divided
us
from
the
other
side
of
the
island
thus
doubling
our
domain
and
our
riches
at
the
same
time
they
formed
a
dwelling
for
madame
hirtel
near
our
own
from
the
same
excavation
in
the
rock
fritz
took
great
pains
with
it
the
windows
are
made
of
oiled
paper
instead
of
glass
but
we
usually
assemble
in
our
large
which
is
very
well
lighted
francis
has
the
charge
of
our
flocks
and
of
the
poultry
all
greatly
increased
for
me
i
preside
over
the
grand
work
of
agriculture
the
two
mothers
their
two
daughters
and
canda
manage
the
garden
spin
weave
take
care
of
our
clothes
and
attend
to
household
matters
thus
we
all
work
and
everything
prospers
several
families
of
the
natives
pupils
of
willis
have
obtained
leave
through
him
to
join
us
and
are
settled
at
falcon
nest
and
at
the
farm
these
people
assist
us
in
the
cultivation
of
our
ground
and
our
dear
missionary
in
the
cultivation
of
our
souls
nothing
is
wanting
to
complete
our
happiness
but
the
return
of
dear
ernest
postscript
two
years
after
we
are
now
as
happy
as
we
can
desire
our
son
is
returned
according
to
my
wishes
he
had
made
out
captain
johnson
and
lieutenant
bell
our
first
visitors
whom
the
storm
had
driven
from
us
but
who
were
still
determined
to
see
us
again
my
son
found
them
preparing
for
another
voyage
to
the
south
seas
he
at
once
seized
the
opportunity
of
accompanying
them
impatiently
desirous
to
revisit
the
island
and
to
bring
to
us
henrietta
bodmer
now
become
his
wife
she
is
a
simple
amiable
swiss
girl
who
suits
us
well
and
who
is
delighted
to
see
once
more
her
kind
aunt
now
become
her
mother
my
wife
is
overjoyed
this
is
her
first
but
jack
and
francis
as
well
as
sophia
and
matilda
are
growing
up
and
moreover
my
dear
wife
who
has
great
ideas
of
married
happiness
hopes
to
induce
emily
to
consent
to
be
united
to
fritz
at
the
same
time
as
her
daughters
are
married
fritz
would
feel
all
the
value
of
this
change
his
character
is
already
softened
by
her
society
and
though
she
is
a
few
years
older
than
he
is
she
is
blessed
with
all
the
vivacity
of
youth
willis
approves
of
this
union
and
we
hope
he
will
live
to
solemnize
the
three
marriages
ernest
and
henrietta
inhabit
the
grotto
ernestine
which
his
brothers
fitted
up
as
a
very
tasteful
dwelling
they
had
even
to
gratify
their
brother
raised
on
the
rock
above
the
grotto
a
sort
of
observatory
where
the
telescope
is
mounted
to
enable
him
to
make
his
astronomical
observations
yet
i
perceive
his
passion
for
exploring
distant
planets
is
less
strong
since
he
has
so
much
to
attach
him
to
this
i
give
this
conclusion
of
my
journal
to
captain
johnson
to
take
into
europe
to
be
added
to
the
former
part
if
any
one
of
my
readers
be
anxious
for
further
particulars
respecting
our
colony
and
our
mode
of
life
let
him
set
out
for
the
happy
island
he
will
be
warmly
welcomed
and
may
join
with

we
