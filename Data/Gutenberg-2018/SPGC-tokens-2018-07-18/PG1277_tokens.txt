there
is
a
special
variety
of
human
nature
obtained
in

by
a

analogous

this
product
is
known
as
the

an
anthropomorphous
growth
watered
by
religious
doctrine
trained
up
in
fear
of
the
guillotine
pruned
by

to
flourish
on
a
third
floor
with
an
estimable
wife
by
his
side
and
an
uninteresting
family
the
number
of
cashiers
in
paris
must
always
be

any

this

perched
upon

her

she
indulges

and

and
then
a

wherefore
that
race
of
corsairs
whom
we
dignify
with
the
title
of

the
gentry
who
take
out
a
license
for
which
they
pay
a
thousand
crowns
as

these
rare
products
of
the
incubations
of
virtue
in
such
esteem
that
they
confine
them
in
cages
in
their
much
as
governments
procure
and
maintain
specimens
of
strange
beasts
at
their
own
charges
if
the
cashier
is
possessed
of
an
imagination
or
of
a
fervid
temperament
if
as
will
sometimes
happen
to
the
most
complete
cashier
he
loves
his
wife
and
that
wife
grows
tired
of
her
lot
has
ambitions
or
merely
some
vanity
in
her
composition
the
cashier
is
undone
search
the
chronicles
of
the
you
will
not
find
a
single
instance
of
a
cashier
attaining
as
it
is
called
they
are
sent
to
the
hulks
they
go
to
foreign
parts
they
vegetate
on
a
second
floor
in
the
rue
among
the
market
gardens
of
the
marais
some
day
when
the
cashiers
of
paris
come
to
a
sense
of
their
real
value
a
cashier
will
be
hardly
obtainable
for
money
still
certain
it
is
that
there
are
people
who
are
fit
for
nothing
but
to
be
cashiers
just
as
the
bent
of
a
certain
order
of
mind
inevitably
makes
for
rascality
but
oh
marvel
of
our
civilization
society
rewards
virtue
with
an
income
of
a
hundred
louis
in
old
age
a
dwelling
on
a
second
floor
bread
sufficient
occasional
new
bandana
handkerchiefs
an
elderly
wife
and
her
offspring
so
much
for
virtue
but
for
the
opposite
course
a
little
boldness
a
faculty
for
keeping
on
the
windward
side
of
the
law
as
turenne
outflanked
montecuculi
and
society
will
sanction
the
theft
of
millions
shower
ribbons
upon
the
thief
cram
him
with
honors
and
smother
him
with
consideration
government
moreover
works
harmoniously
with
this
profoundly
illogical
reasoner
society
government
levies
a
conscription
on
the
young
intelligence
of
the
kingdom
at
the
age
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
a
conscription
of
precocious
before
it
is
sent
up
to
be
submitted
to
a
process
of
selection
nurserymen
sort
and
select
seeds
in
much
the
same
way
to
this
process
the
government
brings
professional
appraisers
of
talent
men
who
can
assay
brains
as
experts
assay
gold
at
the
mint
five
hundred
such
heads
set
afire
with
hope
are
sent
up
annually
by
the
most
progressive
portion
of
the
population
and
of
these
the
government
takes
puts
them
in
sacks
called
the
ecoles
and
shakes
them
up
together
for
three
years
though
every
one
of
these
young
plants
represents
vast
productive
power
they
are
made
as
one
may
say
into
cashiers
they
receive
appointments
the
rank
and
file
of
engineers
is
made
up
of
them
they
are
employed
as
captains
of
artillery
there
is
no
subaltern
grade
to
which
they
may
not
aspire
finally
when
these
men
the
pick
of
the
youth
of
the
nation
fattened
on
mathematics
and
stuffed
with
knowledge
have
attained
the
age
of
fifty
years
they
have
their
reward
and
receive
as
the
price
of
their
services
the
lodging
the
wife
and
family
and
all
the
comforts
that
sweeten
life
for
mediocrity
if
from
among
this
race
of
dupes
there
should
escape
some
five
or
six
men
of
genius
who
climb
the
highest
heights
is
it
not
miraculous
this
is
an
exact
statement
of
the
relations
between
talent
and
probity
on
the
one
hand
and
government
and
society
on
the
other
in
an
age
that
considers
itself
to
be
progressive
without
this
prefatory
explanation
a
recent
occurrence
in
paris
would
seem
improbable
but
preceded
by
this
summing
up
of
the
situation
it
will
perhaps
receive
some
thoughtful
attention
from
minds
capable
of
recognizing
the
real
of
our
civilization
a
civilization
which
since
as
been
moved
by
the
spirit
of
gain
rather
than
by
principles
of
honor
about
five
o
clock
on
a
dull
autumn
afternoon
the
cashier
of
one
of
the
largest
banks
in
paris
was
still
at
his
desk
working
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
that
had
been
lit
for
some
time
in
accordance
with
the
use
and
wont
of
commerce
the
was
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
and
far
from
spacious
mezzanine
floor
and
at
the
very
end
of
a
passage
lighted
only
by
borrowed
lights
the
office
doors
along
this
corridor
each
with
its
label
gave
the
place
the
look
of
a
at
four
o
clock
the
stolid
porter
had
proclaimed
according
to
his
orders
the
bank
is
and
by
this
time
the
departments
were
deserted
wives
of
the
partners
in
the
firm
were
expecting
their
lovers
the
two
bankers
dining
with
their
mistresses
everything
was
in
order
the
place
where
the
strong
boxes
had
been
bedded
in
was
just
behind
the
little
sanctum
where
the
cashier
was
busy
doubtless
he
was
balancing
his
books
the
open
front
gave
a
glimpse
of
a
safe
of
hammered
iron
so
enormously
heavy
thanks
to
the
science
of
the
modern
inventor
that
burglars
could
not
carry
it
away
the
door
only
opened
at
the
pleasure
of
those
who
knew
its
password
the
was
a
warden
who
kept
its
own
secret
and
could
not
be
bribed
the
mysterious
word
was
an
ingenious
realization
of
the
open
sesame
in
the
but
even
this
was
as
nothing
a
man
might
discover
the
password
but
unless
he
knew
the
lock
s
final
secret
the
of
this
dragon
of
mechanical
science
it
discharged
a
blunderbuss
at
his
head
the
door
of
the
room
the
walls
of
the
room
the
shutters
of
the
windows
in
the
room
the
whole
place
in
fact
was
lined
with
a
third
of
an
inch
in
thickness
concealed
behind
the
thin
wooden
paneling
the
shutters
had
been
closed
the
door
had
been
shut
if
ever
man
could
feel
confident
that
he
was
absolutely
alone
and
that
there
was
no
remote
possibility
of
being
watched
by
prying
eyes
that
man
was
the
cashier
of
the
house
of
nucingen
and
company
in
the
rue
accordingly
the
deepest
silence
prevailed
in
that
iron
cave
the
fire
had
died
out
in
the
stove
but
the
room
was
full
of
that
tepid
warmth
which
produces
the
dull
and
nauseous
queasiness
of
a
morning
after
an
orgy
the
stove
is
a
mesmerist
that
plays
no
small
part
in
the
reduction
of
bank
clerks
and
porters
to
a
state
of
idiocy
a
room
with
a
stove
in
it
is
a
retort
in
which
the
power
of
strong
men
is
evaporated
where
their
vitality
is
exhausted
and
their
wills
enfeebled
government
offices
are
part
of
a
great
scheme
for
the
manufacture
of
the
mediocrity
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
a
feudal
system
on
a
pecuniary
basis
and
money
is
the
foundation
of
the
social
contract
see
the
mephitic
vapors
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
crowded
room
contribute
in
no
small
degree
to
bring
about
a
gradual
deterioration
of
intelligences
the
brain
that
gives
off
the
largest
quantity
of
nitrogen
asphyxiates
the
others
in
the
long
run
the
cashier
was
a
man
of
or
thereabouts
as
he
sat
at
the
table
the
light
from
a
moderator
lamp
shining
full
on
his
bald
head
and
glistening
fringe
of
hair
that
surrounded
it
this
baldness
and
the
round
outlines
of
his
face
made
his
head
look
very
like
a
ball
his
complexion
was
a
few
wrinkles
had
gathered
about
his
eyes
but
he
had
the
smooth
plump
hands
of
a
stout
man
his
blue
cloth
coat
a
little
rubbed
and
worn
and
the
creases
and
shininess
of
his
trousers
traces
of
hard
wear
that
the
fails
to
remove
would
impress
a
superficial
observer
with
the
idea
that
here
was
a
thrifty
and
upright
human
being
sufficient
of
the
philosopher
or
of
the
aristocrat
to
wear
shabby
clothes
but
unluckily
it
is
easy
to
find
people
who
will
prove
weak
wasteful
or
incompetent
in
the
capital
things
of
life
the
cashier
wore
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
at
his
for
he
had
been
a
major
of
dragoons
in
the
time
of
the
emperor
de
nucingen
who
had
been
a
contractor
before
he
became
a
banker
had
had
reason
in
those
days
to
know
the
honorable
disposition
of
his
cashier
who
then
occupied
a
high
position
reverses
of
fortune
had
befallen
the
major
and
the
banker
out
of
regard
for
him
paid
him
five
hundred
francs
a
month
the
soldier
had
become
a
cashier
in
the
year
after
his
recovery
from
a
wound
received
at
studzianka
during
the
retreat
from
moscow
followed
by
six
months
of
enforced
idleness
at
strasbourg
whither
several
officers
had
been
transported
by
order
of
the
emperor
that
they
might
receive
skilled
attention
this
particular
officer
castanier
by
name
retired
with
the
honorary
grade
of
colonel
and
a
pension
of
two
thousand
four
hundred
francs
in
ten
years
time
the
cashier
had
completely
effaced
the
soldier
and
castanier
inspired
the
banker
with
such
trust
in
him
that
he
was
associated
in
the
transactions
that
went
on
in
the
private
office
behind
his
little
the
baron
himself
had
access
to
it
by
means
of
a
secret
staircase
there
matters
of
business
were
decided
it
was
the
where
proposals
were
sifted
the
privy
council
chamber
where
the
reports
of
the
money
market
were
analyzed
circular
notes
issued
thence
and
finally
the
private
ledger
and
the
journal
which
summarized
the
work
of
all
the
departments
were
kept
there
castanier
had
gone
himself
to
shut
the
door
which
opened
on
to
a
staircase
that
led
to
the
parlor
occupied
by
the
two
bankers
on
the
first
floor
of
their
hotel
this
done
he
had
sat
down
at
his
desk
again
and
for
a
moment
he
gazed
at
a
little
collection
of
letters
of
credit
drawn
on
the
firm
of
watschildine
of
london
then
he
had
taken
up
the
pen
and
imitated
the
banker
s
signature
on
each
he
wrote
and
eyed
the
forged
signatures
critically
to
see
which
seemed
the
most
perfect
copy
suddenly
he
looked
up
as
if
a
needle
had
pricked
him
you
are
not
alone
a
boding
voice
seemed
to
cry
in
his
heart
and
indeed
the
forger
saw
a
man
standing
at
the
little
grated
window
of
the
a
man
whose
breathing
was
so
noiseless
that
he
did
not
seem
to
breathe
at
all
castanier
looked
and
saw
that
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
was
wide
open
the
stranger
must
have
entered
by
that
way
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
old
soldier
felt
a
sensation
of
dread
that
made
him
stare
and
at
the
man
before
him
and
for
that
matter
the
appearance
of
the
apparition
was
sufficiently
alarming
even
if
unaccompanied
by
the
mysterious
circumstances
of
so
sudden
an
entry
the
rounded
forehead
the
harsh
coloring
of
the
long
oval
face
indicated
quite
as
plainly
as
the
cut
of
his
clothes
that
the
man
was
an
englishman
reeking
of
his
native
isles
you
had
only
to
look
at
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
at
the
voluminous
cravat
which
smothered
the
crushed
frills
of
a
shirt
front
so
white
that
it
brought
out
the
changeless
leaden
hue
of
an
impassive
face
and
the
thin
red
line
of
the
lips
that
seemed
made
to
suck
the
blood
of
corpses
and
you
can
guess
at
once
at
the
black
gaiters
buttoned
up
to
the
knee
and
the
costume
of
a
wealthy
englishman
dressed
for
a
walking
excursion
the
intolerable
glitter
of
the
stranger
s
eyes
produced
a
vivid
and
unpleasant
impression
which
was
only
deepened
by
the
rigid
outlines
of
his
features
the
emaciated
creature
seemed
to
carry
within
him
some
gnawing
thought
that
consumed
him
and
could
not
be
appeased
he
must
have
digested
his
food
so
rapidly
that
he
could
doubtless
eat
continually
without
bringing
any
trace
of
color
into
his
face
or
features
a
tun
of
tokay
de
would
not
have
caused
any
faltering
in
that
piercing
glance
that
read
men
s
inmost
thoughts
nor
dethroned
the
merciless
reasoning
faculty
that
always
seemed
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
things
there
was
something
of
the
fell
and
tranquil
majesty
of
a
tiger
about
him
i
have
come
to
cash
this
bill
of
exchange
sir
he
said
castanier
felt
the
tones
of
his
voice
thrill
through
every
nerve
with
a
violent
shock
similar
to
that
given
by
a
discharge
of
electricity
the
safe
is
closed
said
castanier
it
is
open
said
the
englishman
looking
round
the
is
sunday
and
i
can
not
wait
the
amount
is
for
five
hundred
thousand
francs
you
have
the
money
there
and
i
must
have
but
how
did
you
come
in
sir
the
englishman
smiled
that
smile
frightened
castanier
no
words
could
have
replied
more
fully
nor
more
peremptorily
than
that
scornful
and
imperial
curl
of
the
stranger
s
lips
castanier
turned
away
took
up
fifty
packets
each
containing
ten
thousand
francs
in
and
held
them
out
to
the
stranger
receiving
in
exchange
for
them
a
bill
accepted
by
the
baron
de
nucingen
a
sort
of
convulsive
tremor
ran
through
him
as
he
saw
a
red
gleam
in
the
stranger
s
eyes
when
they
fell
on
the
forged
signature
on
the
letter
of
credit
it
it
wants
your
signature
stammered
castanier
handing
back
the
bill
hand
me
your
pen
answered
the
englishman
castanier
handed
him
the
pen
with
which
he
had
just
committed
forgery
the
stranger
wrote
then
he
returned
the
slip
of
paper
and
the
pen
to
the
cashier
castanier
looked
at
the
handwriting
noticing
that
it
sloped
from
right
to
left
in
the
eastern
fashion
and
melmoth
disappeared
so
noiselessly
that
when
castanier
looked
up
again
an
exclamation
broke
from
him
partly
because
the
man
was
no
longer
there
partly
because
he
felt
a
strange
painful
sensation
such
as
our
imagination
might
take
for
an
effect
of
poison
the
pen
that
melmoth
had
handled
sent
the
same
sickening
heat
through
him
that
an
emetic
produces
but
it
seemed
impossible
to
castanier
that
the
englishman
should
have
guessed
his
crime
his
inward
qualms
he
attributed
to
the
palpitation
of
the
heart
that
according
to
received
ideas
was
sure
to
follow
at
once
on
such
a
turn
as
the
stranger
had
given
him
the
devil
take
it
i
am
very
stupid
providence
is
watching
over
me
for
if
that
brute
had
come
round
to
see
my
gentleman
my
goose
would
have
been
cooked
said
castanier
and
he
burned
the
unsuccessful
attempts
at
forgery
in
the
stove
he
put
the
bill
that
he
meant
to
take
with
him
in
an
envelope
and
helped
himself
to
five
hundred
thousand
francs
in
french
and
english
from
the
safe
which
he
locked
then
he
put
everything
in
order
lit
a
candle
blew
out
the
lamp
took
up
his
hat
and
umbrella
and
went
out
sedately
as
usual
to
leave
one
of
the
two
keys
of
the
strong
room
with
madame
de
nucingen
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
the
baron
you
are
in
luck
castanier
said
the
banker
s
wife
as
he
entered
the
room
we
have
a
holiday
on
monday
you
can
go
into
the
country
or
to
madame
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
your
husband
that
the
bill
of
exchange
on
watschildine
which
was
behind
time
has
just
been
presented
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
have
been
paid
so
i
shall
not
come
back
till
noon
on
monsieur
i
hope
you
will
have
a
pleasant
the
same
to
you
madame
replied
the
old
dragoon
as
he
went
out
he
glanced
as
he
spoke
at
a
young
man
well
known
in
fashionable
society
at
that
time
a
de
rastignac
who
was
regarded
as
madame
de
nucingen
s
lover
madame
remarked
this
latter
the
old
boy
looks
to
me
as
if
he
meant
to
play
you
some
ill
pshaw
impossible
he
is
too
piquoizeau
said
the
cashier
walking
into
the
porter
s
room
what
made
you
let
anybody
come
up
after
four
o
clock
i
have
been
smoking
a
pipe
here
in
the
doorway
ever
since
four
o
clock
said
the
man
and
nobody
has
gone
into
the
bank
nobody
has
come
out
either
except
the
gentlemen
are
you
quite
sure
yes
upon
my
word
and
honor
stay
though
at
four
o
clock
werbrust
s
friend
came
a
young
fellow
from
du
tillet
in
the
rue
all
right
said
castanier
and
he
hurried
away
the
sickening
sensation
of
heat
that
he
had
felt
when
he
took
back
the
pen
returned
in
greater
intensity
thought
he
as
he
threaded
his
way
along
the
boulevard
de
gand
haven
t
i
taken
proper
precautions
let
me
think
two
clear
days
sunday
and
monday
then
a
day
of
uncertainty
before
they
begin
to
look
for
me
altogether
three
days
and
four
nights
respite
i
have
a
couple
of
passports
and
two
different
disguises
is
not
that
enough
to
throw
the
cleverest
detective
off
the
scent
on
tuesday
morning
i
shall
draw
a
million
francs
in
london
before
the
slightest
suspicion
has
been
aroused
my
debts
i
am
leaving
behind
for
the
benefit
of
my
creditors
who
will
put
a
p
on
the
bills
and
i
shall
live
comfortably
in
italy
for
the
rest
of
my
days
as
the
conte
ferraro
i
was
alone
with
him
when
he
died
poor
fellow
in
the
marsh
of
zembin
and
i
shall
slip
into
his
skin
the
woman
who
is
to
follow
after
me
might
give
them
a
clue
think
of
an
old
campaigner
like
me
infatuated
enough
to
tie
myself
to
a
petticoat
tail
why
take
her
i
must
leave
her
behind
yes
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
it
but
i
know
myself
i
should
be
ass
enough
to
go
back
to
her
still
nobody
knows
aquilina
shall
i
take
her
or
leave
her
you
will
not
take
her
cried
a
voice
that
filled
castanier
with
sickening
dread
he
turned
sharply
and
saw
the
englishman
the
devil
is
in
it
cried
the
cashier
aloud
melmoth
had
passed
his
victim
by
this
time
and
if
castanier
s
first
impulse
had
been
to
fasten
a
quarrel
on
a
man
who
read
his
own
thoughts
he
was
so
much
torn
up
by
opposing
feelings
that
the
immediate
result
was
a
temporary
paralysis
when
he
resumed
his
walk
he
fell
once
more
into
that
fever
of
irresolution
which
besets
those
who
are
so
carried
away
by
passion
that
they
are
ready
to
commit
a
crime
but
have
not
sufficient
strength
of
character
to
keep
it
to
themselves
without
suffering
terribly
in
the
process
so
although
castanier
had
made
up
his
mind
to
reap
the
fruits
of
a
crime
which
was
already
half
executed
he
hesitated
to
carry
out
his
designs
for
him
as
for
many
men
of
mixed
character
in
whom
weakness
and
strength
are
equally
blended
the
least
trifling
consideration
determines
whether
they
shall
continue
to
lead
blameless
lives
or
become
actively
criminal
in
the
vast
masses
of
men
enrolled
in
napoleon
s
armies
there
are
many
who
like
castanier
possessed
the
purely
physical
courage
demanded
on
the
battlefield
yet
lacked
the
moral
courage
which
makes
a
man
as
great
in
crime
as
he
could
have
been
in
virtue
the
letter
of
credit
was
drafted
in
such
terms
that
immediately
on
his
arrival
he
might
draw
thousand
pounds
on
the
firm
of
watschildine
the
london
correspondents
of
the
house
of
nucingen
the
london
house
had
already
been
advised
of
the
draft
about
to
be
made
upon
them
he
had
written
to
them
himself
he
had
instructed
an
agent
chosen
at
random
to
take
his
passage
in
a
vessel
which
was
to
leave
portsmouth
with
a
wealthy
english
family
on
board
who
were
going
to
italy
and
the
had
been
paid
in
the
name
of
the
conte
ferraro
the
smallest
details
of
the
scheme
had
been
thought
out
he
had
arranged
matters
so
as
to
divert
the
search
that
would
be
made
for
him
into
belgium
and
switzerland
while
he
himself
was
at
sea
in
the
english
vessel
then
by
the
time
that
nucingen
might
flatter
himself
that
he
was
on
the
track
of
his
late
cashier
the
said
cashier
as
the
conte
ferraro
hoped
to
be
safe
in
naples
he
had
determined
to
disfigure
his
face
in
order
to
disguise
himself
the
more
completely
and
by
means
of
an
acid
to
imitate
the
scars
of
smallpox
yet
in
spite
of
all
these
precautions
which
surely
seemed
as
if
they
must
secure
him
complete
immunity
his
conscience
tormented
him
he
was
afraid
the
even
and
peaceful
life
that
he
had
led
for
so
long
had
modified
the
morality
of
the
camp
his
life
was
stainless
as
yet
he
could
not
sully
it
without
a
pang
so
for
the
last
time
he
abandoned
himself
to
all
the
influences
of
the
better
self
that
strenuously
resisted
pshaw
he
said
at
last
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
and
the
rue
montmartre
i
will
take
a
cab
after
the
play
this
evening
and
go
out
to
versailles
a
will
be
ready
for
me
at
my
old
quartermaster
s
place
he
would
keep
my
secret
even
if
a
dozen
men
were
standing
ready
to
shoot
him
down
the
chances
are
all
in
my
favor
so
far
as
i
see
so
i
shall
take
my
little
naqui
with
me
and
i
will
you
will
not
go
exclaimed
the
englishman
and
the
strange
tones
of
his
voice
drove
all
the
cashier
s
blood
back
to
his
heart
melmoth
stepped
into
a
tilbury
which
was
waiting
for
him
and
was
whirled
away
so
quickly
that
when
castanier
looked
up
he
saw
his
foe
some
hundred
paces
away
from
him
and
before
it
even
crossed
his
mind
to
cut
off
the
man
s
retreat
the
tilbury
was
far
on
its
way
up
the
boulevard
montmartre
well
upon
my
word
there
is
something
supernatural
about
this
said
he
to
himself
if
i
were
fool
enough
to
believe
in
god
i
should
think
that
he
had
set
saint
michael
on
my
tracks
suppose
that
the
devil
and
the
police
should
let
me
go
on
as
i
please
so
as
to
nab
me
in
the
nick
of
time
did
any
one
ever
see
the
like
but
there
this
is
folly
castanier
went
along
the
rue
du
slackening
his
pace
as
he
neared
the
rue
richer
there
on
the
second
floor
of
a
block
of
buildings
which
looked
out
upon
some
gardens
lived
the
unconscious
cause
of
castanier
s
crime
a
young
woman
known
in
the
quarter
as
mme
de
la
garde
a
concise
history
of
certain
events
in
the
cashier
s
past
life
must
be
given
in
order
to
explain
these
facts
and
to
give
a
complete
presentment
of
the
crisis
when
he
yielded
to
temptation
mme
de
la
garde
said
that
she
was
a
piedmontese
no
one
not
even
castanier
knew
her
real
name
she
was
one
of
those
young
girls
who
are
driven
by
dire
misery
by
inability
to
earn
a
living
or
by
fear
of
starvation
to
have
recourse
to
a
trade
which
most
of
them
loathe
many
regard
with
indifference
and
some
few
follow
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
their
constitution
but
on
the
brink
of
the
gulf
of
prostitution
in
paris
the
young
girl
of
sixteen
beautiful
and
pure
as
the
madonna
had
met
with
castanier
the
old
dragoon
was
too
rough
and
homely
to
make
his
way
in
society
and
he
was
tired
of
tramping
the
boulevard
at
night
and
of
the
kind
of
conquests
made
there
by
gold
for
some
time
past
he
had
desired
to
bring
a
certain
regularity
into
an
irregular
life
he
was
struck
by
the
beauty
of
the
poor
child
who
had
drifted
by
chance
into
his
arms
and
his
determination
to
rescue
her
from
the
life
of
the
streets
was
half
benevolent
half
selfish
as
some
of
the
thoughts
of
the
best
of
men
are
apt
to
be
social
conditions
mingle
elements
of
evil
with
the
promptings
of
natural
goodness
of
heart
and
the
mixture
of
motives
underlying
a
man
s
intentions
should
be
leniently
judged
castanier
had
just
cleverness
enough
to
be
very
shrewd
where
his
own
interests
were
concerned
so
he
concluded
to
be
a
philanthropist
on
either
count
and
at
first
made
her
his
mistress
hey
hey
he
said
to
himself
in
his
soldierly
fashion
i
am
an
old
wolf
and
a
sheep
shall
not
make
a
fool
of
me
castanier
old
man
before
you
set
up
housekeeping
reconnoitre
the
girl
s
character
for
a
bit
and
see
if
she
is
a
steady
this
irregular
union
gave
the
piedmontese
a
status
the
most
nearly
approaching
respectability
among
those
which
the
world
declines
to
recognize
during
the
first
year
she
took
the
de
of
aquilina
one
of
the
characters
in
which
she
had
chanced
to
read
she
fancied
that
she
resembled
the
courtesan
in
face
and
general
appearance
and
in
a
certain
precocity
of
heart
and
brain
of
which
she
was
conscious
when
castanier
found
that
her
life
was
as
well
regulated
and
virtuous
as
was
possible
for
a
social
outlaw
he
manifested
a
desire
that
they
should
live
as
husband
and
wife
so
she
took
the
name
of
mme
de
la
garde
in
order
to
approach
as
closely
as
parisian
usages
permit
the
conditions
of
a
real
marriage
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
of
these
unfortunate
girls
have
one
fixed
idea
to
be
looked
upon
as
respectable
women
who
lead
humdrum
lives
of
faithfulness
to
their
husbands
women
who
would
make
excellent
mothers
keepers
of
household
accounts
and
menders
of
household
linen
this
longing
springs
from
a
sentiment
so
laudable
that
society
should
take
it
into
consideration
but
society
incorrigible
as
ever
will
assuredly
persist
in
regarding
the
married
woman
as
a
corvette
duly
authorized
by
her
flag
and
papers
to
go
on
her
own
course
while
the
woman
who
is
a
wife
in
all
but
name
is
a
pirate
and
an
outlaw
for
lack
of
a
document
a
day
came
when
mme
de
la
garde
would
fain
have
signed
herself
mme
the
cashier
was
put
out
by
this
so
you
do
not
love
me
well
enough
to
marry
me
she
said
castanier
did
not
answer
he
was
absorbed
by
his
thoughts
the
poor
girl
resigned
herself
to
her
fate
the
was
in
despair
naqui
s
heart
softened
towards
him
at
the
sight
of
his
trouble
she
tried
to
soothe
him
but
what
could
she
do
when
she
did
not
know
what
ailed
him
when
naqui
made
up
her
mind
to
know
the
secret
although
she
never
asked
him
a
question
the
cashier
dolefully
confessed
to
the
existence
of
a
mme
castanier
this
lawful
wife
a
thousand
times
accursed
was
living
in
a
humble
way
in
strasbourg
on
a
small
property
there
he
wrote
to
her
twice
a
year
and
kept
the
secret
of
her
existence
so
well
that
no
one
suspected
that
he
was
married
the
reason
of
this
reticence
if
it
is
familiar
to
many
military
men
who
may
chance
to
be
in
a
like
predicament
it
is
perhaps
worth
while
to
give
the
story
your
genuine
trooper
if
it
is
allowable
here
to
employ
the
word
which
in
the
army
signifies
a
man
who
is
destined
to
die
as
a
captain
is
a
sort
of
serf
a
part
and
parcel
of
his
regiment
an
essentially
simple
creature
and
castanier
was
marked
out
by
nature
as
a
victim
to
the
wiles
of
mothers
with
daughters
left
too
long
on
their
hands
it
was
at
nancy
during
one
of
those
brief
intervals
of
repose
when
the
imperial
armies
were
not
on
active
service
abroad
that
castanier
was
so
unlucky
as
to
pay
some
attention
to
a
young
lady
with
whom
he
danced
at
a
the
provincial
name
for
the
entertainments
often
given
by
the
military
to
the
townsfolk
or
vice
versa
in
garrison
towns
a
scheme
for
inveigling
the
gallant
captain
into
matrimony
was
immediately
set
on
foot
one
of
those
schemes
by
which
mothers
secure
accomplices
in
a
human
heart
by
touching
all
its
motive
springs
while
they
convert
all
their
friends
into
like
all
people
possessed
by
one
idea
these
ladies
press
everything
into
the
service
of
their
great
project
slowly
elaborating
their
toils
much
as
the
excavates
its
funnel
in
the
sand
and
lies
in
wait
at
the
bottom
for
its
victim
suppose
that
no
one
strays
after
all
into
that
carefully
constructed
labyrinth
suppose
that
the
dies
of
hunger
and
thirst
in
her
pit
such
things
may
be
but
if
any
heedless
creature
once
enters
in
it
never
comes
out
all
the
wires
which
could
be
pulled
to
induce
action
on
the
captain
s
part
were
tried
appeals
were
made
to
the
secret
interested
motives
that
always
come
into
play
in
such
cases
they
worked
on
castanier
s
hopes
and
on
the
weaknesses
and
vanity
of
human
nature
unluckily
he
had
praised
the
daughter
to
her
mother
when
he
brought
her
back
after
a
waltz
a
little
chat
followed
and
then
an
invitation
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
once
introduced
into
the
house
the
dragoon
was
dazzled
by
the
hospitality
of
a
family
who
appeared
to
conceal
their
real
wealth
beneath
a
show
of
careful
economy
he
was
skilfully
flattered
on
all
sides
and
every
one
extolled
for
his
benefit
the
various
treasures
there
displayed
a
neatly
timed
dinner
served
on
plate
lent
by
an
uncle
the
attention
shown
to
him
by
the
only
daughter
of
the
house
the
gossip
of
the
town
a
who
seemed
likely
to
cut
the
ground
from
under
his
feet
all
the
innumerable
snares
in
short
of
the
provincial
were
set
for
him
and
to
such
good
purpose
that
castanier
said
five
years
later
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
how
it
came
about
the
dragoon
received
fifteen
thousand
francs
with
the
lady
who
after
two
years
of
marriage
became
the
ugliest
and
consequently
the
most
peevish
woman
on
earth
luckily
they
had
no
children
the
fair
complexion
maintained
by
a
spartan
regimen
the
fresh
bright
color
in
her
face
which
spoke
of
an
engaging
modesty
became
overspread
with
blotches
and
pimples
her
figure
which
had
seemed
so
straight
grew
crooked
the
angel
became
a
suspicious
and
shrewish
creature
who
drove
castanier
frantic
then
the
fortune
took
to
itself
wings
at
length
the
dragoon
no
longer
recognizing
the
woman
whom
he
had
wedded
left
her
to
live
on
a
little
property
at
strasbourg
until
the
time
when
it
should
please
god
to
remove
her
to
adorn
paradise
she
was
one
of
those
virtuous
women
who
for
want
of
other
occupation
would
weary
the
life
out
of
an
angel
with
complainings
who
pray
till
if
their
prayers
are
heard
in
heaven
they
must
exhaust
the
patience
of
the
almighty
and
say
everything
that
is
bad
of
their
husbands
in
dovelike
murmurs
over
a
game
of
boston
with
their
neighbors
when
aquilina
learned
all
these
troubles
she
clung
still
more
affectionately
to
castanier
and
made
him
so
happy
varying
with
woman
s
ingenuity
the
pleasures
with
which
she
filled
his
life
that
all
unwittingly
she
was
the
cause
of
the
cashier
s
downfall
like
many
women
who
seem
by
nature
destined
to
sound
all
the
depths
of
love
mme
de
la
garde
was
disinterested
she
asked
neither
for
gold
nor
for
jewelry
gave
no
thought
to
the
future
lived
entirely
for
the
present
and
for
the
pleasures
of
the
present
she
accepted
expensive
ornaments
and
dresses
the
carriage
so
eagerly
coveted
by
women
of
her
class
as
one
harmony
the
more
in
the
picture
of
life
there
was
absolutely
no
vanity
in
her
desire
not
to
appear
at
a
better
advantage
but
to
look
the
fairer
and
moreover
no
woman
could
live
without
luxuries
more
cheerfully
when
a
man
of
generous
nature
and
military
men
are
mostly
of
this
stamp
meets
with
such
a
woman
he
feels
a
sort
of
exasperation
at
finding
himself
her
debtor
in
generosity
he
feels
that
he
could
stop
a
mail
coach
to
obtain
money
for
her
if
he
has
not
sufficient
for
her
whims
he
will
commit
a
crime
if
so
he
may
be
great
and
noble
in
the
eyes
of
some
woman
or
of
his
special
public
such
is
the
nature
of
the
man
such
a
lover
is
like
a
gambler
who
would
be
dishonored
in
his
own
eyes
if
he
did
not
repay
the
sum
he
borrowed
from
a
waiter
in
a
but
will
shrink
from
no
crime
will
leave
his
wife
and
children
without
a
penny
and
rob
and
murder
if
so
he
may
come
to
the
with
a
full
purse
and
his
honor
remain
untarnished
among
the
frequenters
of
that
fatal
abode
so
it
was
with
castanier
he
had
begun
by
installing
aquiline
is
a
modest
dwelling
the
furniture
being
of
the
simplest
kind
but
when
he
saw
the
girl
s
beauty
and
great
qualities
when
he
had
known
inexpressible
and
happiness
with
her
he
began
to
dote
upon
her
and
longed
to
adorn
his
idol
then
aquilina
s
toilette
was
so
comically
out
of
keeping
with
her
poor
abode
that
for
both
their
sakes
it
was
clearly
incumbent
on
him
to
move
the
change
swallowed
up
almost
all
castanier
s
savings
for
he
furnished
his
domestic
paradise
with
all
the
prodigality
that
is
lavished
on
a
kept
mistress
a
pretty
woman
must
have
everything
pretty
about
her
the
unity
of
charm
in
the
woman
and
her
surroundings
singles
her
out
from
among
her
sex
this
sentiment
of
homogeneity
indeed
though
it
has
frequently
escaped
the
attention
of
observers
is
instinctive
in
human
nature
and
the
same
prompting
leads
elderly
spinsters
to
surround
themselves
with
dreary
relics
of
the
past
but
the
lovely
piedmontese
must
have
the
newest
and
latest
fashions
and
all
that
was
daintiest
and
prettiest
in
stuffs
for
hangings
in
silks
or
jewelry
in
fine
china
and
other
brittle
and
fragile
wares
she
asked
for
nothing
but
when
she
was
called
upon
to
make
a
choice
when
castanier
asked
her
which
do
you
like
she
would
answer
why
this
is
the
nicest
love
never
counts
the
cost
and
castanier
therefore
always
took
the
when
once
the
standard
had
been
set
up
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
everything
in
the
household
must
be
in
conformity
from
the
linen
plate
and
crystal
through
a
thousand
and
one
items
of
expenditure
down
to
the
pots
and
pans
in
the
kitchen
castanier
had
meant
to
do
things
simply
as
the
saying
goes
but
he
gradually
found
himself
more
and
more
in
debt
one
expense
entailed
another
the
clock
called
for
candle
sconces
fires
must
be
lighted
in
the
ornamental
grates
but
the
curtains
and
hangings
were
too
fresh
and
delicate
to
be
soiled
by
smuts
so
they
must
be
replaced
by
patent
and
elaborate
fireplaces
warranted
to
give
out
no
smoke
recent
inventions
of
the
people
who
are
so
clever
at
drawing
up
a
prospectus
then
aquilina
found
it
so
nice
to
run
about
barefooted
on
the
carpet
in
her
room
that
castanier
must
have
soft
carpets
laid
everywhere
for
the
pleasure
of
playing
with
naqui
a
bathroom
too
was
built
for
her
everything
to
the
end
that
she
might
be
more
comfortable
shopkeepers
workmen
and
manufacturers
in
paris
have
a
mysterious
knack
of
enlarging
a
hole
in
a
man
s
purse
they
can
not
give
the
price
of
anything
upon
inquiry
and
as
the
paroxysm
of
longing
can
not
abide
delay
orders
are
given
by
the
feeble
light
of
an
approximate
estimate
of
cost
the
same
people
never
send
in
the
bills
at
once
but
ply
the
purchaser
with
furniture
till
his
head
spins
everything
is
so
pretty
so
charming
and
every
one
is
satisfied
a
few
months
later
the
obliging
furniture
dealers
are
metamorphosed
and
reappear
in
the
shape
of
alarming
totals
on
invoices
that
fill
the
soul
with
their
horrid
clamor
they
are
in
urgent
want
of
the
money
they
are
as
you
may
say
on
the
brink
of
bankruptcy
their
tears
flow
it
is
heartrending
to
hear
them
and
then
the
gulf
yawns
and
gives
up
serried
columns
of
figures
marching
four
deep
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
should
have
issued
innocently
three
by
three
before
castanier
had
any
idea
of
how
much
he
had
spent
he
had
arranged
for
aquilina
to
have
a
carriage
from
a
livery
stable
when
she
went
out
instead
of
a
cab
castanier
was
a
gourmand
he
engaged
an
excellent
cook
and
aquilina
to
please
him
had
herself
made
the
purchases
of
early
fruit
and
vegetables
rare
delicacies
and
exquisite
wines
but
as
aquilina
had
nothing
of
her
own
these
gifts
of
hers
so
precious
by
reason
of
the
thought
and
tact
and
graciousness
that
prompted
them
were
no
less
a
drain
upon
castanier
s
purse
he
did
not
like
his
naqui
to
be
without
money
and
naqui
could
not
keep
money
in
her
pocket
so
the
table
was
a
heavy
item
of
expenditure
for
a
man
with
castanier
s
income
the
was
compelled
to
resort
to
various
shifts
for
obtaining
money
for
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
renounce
this
delightful
life
he
loved
the
woman
too
well
to
cross
the
freaks
of
the
mistress
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
through
or
through
weakness
of
character
can
refuse
nothing
to
a
woman
false
shame
overpowers
them
and
they
rather
face
ruin
than
make
the
admissions
i
can
not
my
means
will
not
permit
i
can
not
afford
when
therefore
castanier
saw
that
if
he
meant
to
emerge
from
the
abyss
of
debt
into
which
he
had
plunged
he
must
part
with
aquilina
and
live
upon
bread
and
water
he
was
so
unable
to
do
without
her
or
to
change
his
habits
of
life
that
daily
he
put
off
his
plans
of
reform
until
the
morrow
the
debts
were
pressing
and
he
began
by
borrowing
money
his
position
and
previous
character
inspired
confidence
and
of
this
he
took
advantage
to
devise
a
system
of
borrowing
money
as
he
required
it
then
as
the
total
amount
of
debt
rapidly
increased
he
had
recourse
to
those
commercial
inventions
known
as
accommodation
bills
this
form
of
bill
does
not
represent
goods
or
other
value
received
and
the
first
endorser
pays
the
amount
named
for
the
obliging
person
who
accepts
it
this
species
of
fraud
is
tolerated
because
it
is
impossible
to
detect
it
and
moreover
it
is
an
imaginary
fraud
which
only
becomes
real
if
payment
is
ultimately
refused
when
at
length
it
was
evidently
impossible
to
borrow
any
longer
whether
because
the
amount
of
the
debt
was
now
so
greatly
increased
or
because
castanier
was
unable
to
pay
the
large
amount
of
interest
on
the
aforesaid
sums
of
money
the
cashier
saw
bankruptcy
before
him
on
making
this
discovery
he
decided
for
a
fraudulent
bankruptcy
rather
than
an
ordinary
failure
and
preferred
a
crime
to
a
misdemeanor
he
determined
after
the
fashion
of
the
celebrated
cashier
of
the
royal
treasury
to
abuse
the
trust
deservedly
won
and
to
increase
the
number
of
his
creditors
by
making
a
final
loan
of
the
sum
sufficient
to
keep
him
in
comfort
in
a
foreign
country
for
the
rest
of
his
days
all
this
as
has
been
seen
he
had
prepared
to
do
aquilina
knew
nothing
of
the
irksome
cares
of
this
life
she
enjoyed
her
existence
as
many
a
woman
does
making
no
inquiry
as
to
where
the
money
came
from
even
as
sundry
other
folk
will
eat
their
buttered
rolls
untroubled
by
any
restless
spirit
of
curiosity
as
to
the
culture
and
growth
of
wheat
but
as
the
labor
and
miscalculations
of
agriculture
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
baker
s
oven
so
beneath
the
unappreciated
luxury
of
many
a
parisian
household
lie
intolerable
anxieties
and
exorbitant
toil
while
castanier
was
enduring
the
torture
of
the
strain
and
his
thoughts
were
full
of
the
deed
that
should
change
his
whole
life
aquilina
was
lying
luxuriously
back
in
a
great
armchair
by
the
fireside
beguiling
the
time
by
chatting
with
her
as
frequently
happens
in
such
cases
the
maid
had
become
the
mistress
confidant
jenny
having
first
assured
herself
that
her
mistress
ascendency
over
castanier
was
complete
what
are
we
to
do
this
evening
leon
seems
determined
to
come
mme
de
la
garde
was
saying
as
she
read
a
passionate
epistle
indited
upon
a
faint
gray
notepaper
here
is
the
master
said
jenny
castanier
came
in
aquilina
nowise
disconcerted
crumpled
up
the
letter
took
it
with
the
tongs
and
held
it
in
the
flames
so
that
is
what
you
do
with
your
is
it
asked
castanier
oh
goodness
yes
said
aquilina
is
it
not
the
best
way
of
keeping
them
safe
besides
fire
should
go
to
fire
as
water
makes
for
the
you
are
talking
as
if
it
were
a
real
naqui
well
am
i
not
handsome
enough
to
receive
them
she
said
holding
up
her
forehead
for
a
kiss
there
was
a
carelessness
in
her
manner
that
would
have
told
any
man
less
blind
than
castanier
that
it
was
only
a
piece
of
conjugal
duty
as
it
were
to
give
this
joy
to
the
cashier
but
use
and
wont
had
brought
castanier
to
the
point
where
is
no
longer
possible
for
love
i
have
taken
a
box
at
the
gymnase
this
evening
he
said
let
us
have
dinner
early
and
then
we
need
not
dine
in
a
go
and
take
jenny
i
am
tired
of
plays
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
this
evening
i
would
rather
stay
here
by
the
come
all
the
same
though
naqui
i
shall
not
be
here
to
bore
you
much
longer
yes
quiqui
i
am
going
to
start
and
it
will
be
some
time
before
i
come
back
again
i
am
leaving
everything
in
your
charge
will
you
keep
your
heart
for
me
too
neither
my
heart
nor
anything
else
she
said
but
when
you
come
back
again
naqui
will
still
be
naqui
for
well
this
is
frankness
so
you
would
not
follow
me
why
not
eh
why
how
can
i
leave
the
lover
who
writes
me
such
sweet
little
notes
she
asked
pointing
to
the
blackened
scrap
of
paper
with
a
mocking
smile
is
there
any
truth
in
it
asked
castanier
have
you
really
a
lover
really
cried
aquilina
and
have
you
never
given
it
a
serious
thought
dear
to
begin
with
you
are
fifty
years
old
then
you
have
just
the
sort
of
face
to
put
on
a
fruit
stall
if
the
woman
tried
to
see
you
for
a
pumpkin
no
one
would
contradict
her
you
puff
and
blow
like
a
seal
when
you
come
upstairs
your
paunch
rises
and
falls
like
a
diamond
on
a
woman
s
forehead
it
is
pretty
plain
that
you
served
in
the
dragoons
you
are
a
very
old
man
if
you
have
any
mind
to
keep
my
respect
i
recommend
you
not
to
add
imbecility
to
these
qualities
by
imagining
that
such
a
girl
as
i
am
will
be
content
with
your
asthmatic
love
and
not
look
for
youth
and
good
looks
and
pleasure
by
way
of
a
variety
aquilina
you
are
laughing
of
course
oh
very
well
and
are
you
not
laughing
too
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
telling
me
that
you
are
going
away
i
am
going
to
start
she
said
mimicking
his
tones
stuff
and
nonsense
would
you
talk
like
that
if
you
were
really
going
from
your
naqui
you
would
cry
like
the
booby
that
you
are
after
all
if
i
go
will
you
follow
he
asked
tell
me
first
whether
this
journey
of
yours
is
a
bad
joke
or
yes
seriously
i
am
well
then
seriously
i
shall
stay
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
my
boy
i
will
wait
till
you
come
back
i
would
sooner
take
leave
of
life
than
take
leave
of
my
dear
cozy
paris
will
you
not
come
to
italy
to
naples
and
lead
a
pleasant
life
there
a
delicious
luxurious
life
with
this
stout
old
fogy
of
yours
who
puffs
and
blows
like
a
seal
ungrateful
girl
ungrateful
she
cried
rising
to
her
feet
i
might
leave
this
house
this
moment
and
take
nothing
out
of
it
but
myself
i
shall
have
given
you
all
the
treasures
a
young
girl
can
give
and
something
that
not
every
drop
in
your
veins
and
mine
can
ever
give
me
back
if
by
any
means
whatever
by
selling
my
hopes
of
eternity
for
instance
i
could
recover
my
past
self
body
and
soul
for
i
have
perhaps
redeemed
my
soul
and
be
pure
as
a
lily
for
my
lover
i
would
not
hesitate
a
moment
what
sort
of
devotion
has
rewarded
mine
you
have
housed
and
fed
me
just
as
you
give
a
dog
food
and
a
kennel
because
he
is
a
protection
to
the
house
and
he
may
take
kicks
when
we
are
out
of
humor
and
lick
our
hands
as
soon
as
we
are
pleased
to
call
him
and
which
of
us
two
will
have
been
the
more
generous
oh
dear
child
do
you
not
see
that
i
am
joking
returned
castanier
i
am
going
on
a
short
journey
i
shall
not
be
away
for
very
long
but
come
with
me
to
the
gymnase
i
shall
start
just
before
midnight
after
i
have
had
time
to
say
to
poor
pet
so
you
are
really
going
are
you
she
said
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
drew
down
his
head
against
her
bodice
you
are
smothering
me
cried
castanier
with
his
face
buried
in
aquilina
s
breast
that
damsel
turned
to
say
in
jenny
s
ear
go
to

clock
if

not
find
him
and
he
comes
here
during
the
keep

in
your
well
she
went
on
setting
free
castanier
and
giving
a
tweak
to
the
tip
of
his
nose
never
mind
handsomest
of
seals
that
you
are
i
will
go
to
the
theatre

but
all
in
good
time
let
us
have
dinner
there
is
a
nice
little
dinner
for
you
just
what
you
it
is
very
hard
to
part
from
such
a
woman
as
you
exclaimed
castanier
very
well
then
why
do
you
go
asked
she
ah
why

if
i
were
to
begin

begin
to
explain
the
reasons

prove
to

to
madness

father

now
promise
it
at
once
and
give
us
your
fist
upon
i
should
kill
you
and
castanier
smiled
as
he
spoke
they
sat
down
to
the
dinner
table
and
went
thence
to
the
gymnase
when
the
first
part
of
the
performance
was
over
it
occurred
to
castanier
to
show
himself
to
some
of
his
acquaintances
in
the
house
so
as
to
turn
away
any
suspicion
of
his
departure
he
left
mme
de
la
garde
in
the
corner
box
where
she
was
seated
according
to
her
modest
wont
and
went
to
walk
up
and
down
in
the
lobby
he
had
not
gone
many
paces
before
he
saw
the
englishman
and
with
a
sudden
return
of
the
sickening
sensation
of
heat
that
once
before
had
vibrated
through
him
and
of
the
terror
that
he
had
felt
already
he
stood
face
to
face
with
melmoth
forger
at
the
word
castanier
glanced
round
at
the
people
who
were
moving
about
them
he
fancied
that
he
could
see
astonishment
and
curiosity
in
their
eyes
and
wishing
to
be
rid
of
this
englishman
at
once
he
raised
his
hand
to
strike
him
and
felt
his
arm
paralyzed
by
some
invisible
power
that
sapped
his
strength
and
nailed
him
to
the
spot
he
allowed
the
stranger
to
take
him
by
the
arm
and
they
walked
together
to
the
like
two
friends
who
is
strong
enough
to
resist
me
said
the
englishman
addressing
him
do
you
not
know
that
everything
here
on
earth
must
obey
me
that
it
is
in
my
power
to
do
everything
i
read
men
s
thoughts
i
see
the
future
and
i
know
the
past
i
am
here
and
i
can
be
elsewhere
also
time
and
space
and
distance
are
nothing
to
me
the
whole
world
is
at
my
beck
and
call
i
have
the
power
of
continual
enjoyment
and
of
giving
joy
i
can
see
through
walls
discover
hidden
treasures
and
fill
my
hands
with
them
palaces
arise
at
my
nod
and
my
architect
makes
no
mistakes
i
can
make
all
lands
break
forth
into
blossom
heap
up
their
gold
and
precious
stones
and
surround
myself
with
fair
women
and
ever
new
faces
everything
is
yielded
up
to
my
will
i
could
gamble
on
the
stock
exchange
and
my
speculations
would
be
infallible
but
a
man
who
can
find
the
hoards
that
misers
have
hidden
in
the
earth
need
not
trouble
himself
about
stocks
feel
the
strength
of
the
hand
that
grasps
you
poor
wretch
doomed
to
shame
try
to
bend
the
arm
of
iron
try
to
soften
the
adamantine
heart
fly
from
me
if
you
dare
you
would
hear
my
voice
in
the
depths
of
the
caves
that
lie
under
the
seine
you
might
hide
in
the
catacombs
but
would
you
not
see
me
there
my
voice
could
be
heard
through
the
sound
of
thunder
my
eyes
shine
as
brightly
as
the
sun
for
i
am
the
peer
of
lucifer
castanier
heard
the
terrible
words
and
felt
no
protest
nor
contradiction
within
himself
he
walked
side
by
side
with
the
englishman
and
had
no
power
to
leave
him
you
are
mine
you
have
just
committed
a
crime
i
have
found
at
last
the
mate
whom
i
have
sought
have
you
a
mind
to
learn
your
destiny
aha
you
came
here
to
see
a
play
and
you
shall
see
a
play
nay
two
come
present
me
to
mme
de
la
garde
as
one
of
your
best
friends
am
i
not
your
last
hope
of
escape
castanier
followed
by
the
stranger
returned
to
his
box
and
in
accordance
with
the
order
he
had
just
received
he
hastened
to
introduce
melmoth
to
mme
de
la
garde
aquilina
seemed
to
be
not
in
the
least
surprised
the
englishman
declined
to
take
a
seat
in
front
and
castanier
was
once
more
beside
his
mistress
the
man
s
slightest
wish
must
be
obeyed
the
last
piece
was
about
to
begin
for
at
that
time
small
theatres
gave
only
three
pieces
one
of
the
actors
had
made
the
gymnase
the
fashion
and
that
evening
perlet
the
actor
in
question
was
to
play
in
a
vaudeville
called
comedien
d
in
which
he
filled
four
different
parts
when
the
curtain
rose
the
stranger
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
crowded
house
castanier
s
cry
of
terror
died
away
for
the
walls
of
his
throat
seemed
glued
together
as
melmoth
pointed
to
the
stage
and
the
cashier
knew
that
the
play
had
been
changed
at
the
englishman
s
desire
he
saw
the
at
the
bank
he
saw
the
baron
de
nucingen
in
conference
with
a
from
the
prefecture
who
was
informing
him
of
castanier
s
conduct
explaining
that
the
cashier
had
absconded
with
money
taken
from
the
safe
giving
the
history
of
the
forged
signature
the
information
was
put
in
writing
the
document
signed
and
duly
despatched
to
the
public
prosecutor
are
we
in
time
do
you
think
asked
nucingen
yes
said
the
agent
of
police
he
is
at
the
gymnase
and
has
no
suspicion
of
castanier
fidgeted
on
his
chair
and
made
as
if
he
would
leave
the
theatre
but
melmoth
s
hand
lay
on
his
shoulder
and
he
was
obliged
to
sit
and
watch
the
hideous
power
of
the
man
produced
an
effect
like
that
of
nightmare
and
he
could
not
move
a
limb
nay
the
man
himself
was
the
nightmare
his
presence
weighed
heavily
on
his
victim
like
a
poisoned
atmosphere
when
the
wretched
cashier
turned
to
implore
the
englishman
s
mercy
he
met
those
blazing
eyes
that
discharged
electric
currents
which
pierced
through
him
and
transfixed
him
like
darts
of
steel
what
have
i
done
to
you
he
said
in
his
prostrate
helplessness
and
he
breathed
hard
like
a
stag
at
the
water
s
edge
what
do
you
want
of
me
look
cried
melmoth
castanier
looked
at
the
stage
the
scene
had
been
changed
the
play
seemed
to
be
over
and
castanier
beheld
himself
stepping
from
the
carriage
with
aquilina
but
as
he
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
house
on
the
rue
richer
the
scene
again
was
suddenly
changed
and
he
saw
his
own
house
jenny
was
chatting
by
the
fire
in
her
mistress
room
with
a
subaltern
officer
of
a
line
regiment
then
stationed
at
paris
he
is
going
is
he
said
the
sergeant
who
seemed
to
belong
to
a
family
in
easy
circumstances
i
can
be
happy
at
my
ease
i
love
aquilina
too
well
to
allow
her
to
belong
to
that
old
toad
i
myself
am
going
to
marry
mme
de
la
garde
cried
the
sergeant
old
toad
castanier
murmured
piteously
here
come
the
master
and
mistress
hide
yourself
stay
get
in
here
monsieur
leon
said
jenny
the
master
won
t
stay
here
for
very
castanier
watched
the
sergeant
hide
himself
among
aquilina
s
gowns
in
her
almost
immediately
he
himself
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
took
leave
of
his
mistress
who
made
fun
of
him
in
asides
to
jenny
while
she
uttered
the
sweetest
and
tenderest
words
in
his
ears
she
wept
with
one
side
of
her
face
and
laughed
with
the
other
the
audience
called
for
an
encore
accursed
creature
cried
castanier
from
his
box
aquilina
was
laughing
till
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
goodness
she
cried
how
funny
perlet
is
as
the
englishwoman
why
don
t
you
laugh
every
one
else
in
the
house
is
laughing
laugh
dear
she
said
to
castanier
melmoth
burst
out
laughing
and
the
unhappy
cashier
shuddered
the
englishman
s
laughter
wrung
his
heart
and
tortured
his
brain
it
was
as
if
a
surgeon
had
bored
his
skull
with
a
iron
laughing
are
they
laughing
stammered
castanier
he
did
not
see
the
prim
english
lady
whom
perlet
was
acting
with
such
ludicrous
effect
nor
hear
the
that
had
filled
the
house
with
roars
of
laughter
instead
of
all
this
he
beheld
himself
hurrying
from
the
rue
richer
hailing
a
cab
on
the
boulevard
bargaining
with
the
man
to
take
him
to
versailles
then
once
more
the
scene
changed
he
recognized
the
sorry
inn
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
l
orangerie
and
the
rue
des
recollets
which
was
kept
by
his
old
quartermaster
it
was
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
most
perfect
stillness
prevailed
no
one
was
there
to
watch
his
movements
the
were
put
into
the
carriage
it
came
from
a
house
in
the
avenue
de
paris
in
which
an
englishman
lived
and
had
been
ordered
in
the
foreigner
s
name
to
avoid
raising
suspicion
castanier
saw
that
he
had
his
bills
and
his
passports
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
set
out
but
at
the
barrier
he
saw
two
gendarmes
lying
in
wait
for
the
carriage
a
cry
of
horror
burst
from
him
but
melmoth
gave
him
a
glance
and
again
the
sound
died
in
his
throat
keep
your
eyes
on
the
stage
and
be
quiet
said
the
englishman
in
another
moment
castanier
saw
himself
flung
into
prison
at
the
conciergerie
and
in
the
fifth
act
of
the
drama
entitled
he
saw
himself
in
three
months
time
condemned
to
twenty
years
of
penal
servitude
again
a
cry
broke
from
him
he
was
exposed
upon
the
place
du
and
the
executioner
branded
him
with
a
iron
then
came
the
last
scene
of
all
among
some
sixty
convicts
in
the
prison
yard
of
the
bicetre
he
was
awaiting
his
turn
to
have
the
irons
riveted
on
his
limbs
dear
me
i
can
not
laugh
any
more
said
aquilina
you
are
very
solemn
dear
boy
what
can
be
the
matter
the
gentleman
has
a
word
with
you
castanier
said
melmoth
when
the
piece
was
at
an
end
and
the
attendant
was
fastening
mme
de
la
garde
s
cloak
the
corridor
was
crowded
and
escape
impossible
very
well
what
is
it
no
human
power
can
hinder
you
from
taking
aquilina
home
and
going
next
to
versailles
there
to
be
how
so
because
you
are
in
a
hand
that
will
never
relax
its
grasp
returned
the
englishman
castanier
longed
for
the
power
to
utter
some
word
that
should
blot
him
out
from
among
living
men
and
hide
him
in
the
lowest
depths
of
hell
suppose
that
the
devil
were
to
make
a
bid
for
your
soul
would
you
not
give
it
to
him
now
in
exchange
for
the
power
of
god
one
single
word
and
those
five
hundred
thousand
francs
shall
be
back
in
the
baron
de
nucingen
s
safe
then
you
can
tear
up
the
letter
of
credit
and
all
traces
of
your
crime
will
be
obliterated
moreover
you
would
have
gold
in
torrents
you
hardly
believe
in
anything
perhaps
well
if
all
this
comes
to
pass
you
will
believe
at
least
in
the
if
it
were
only
possible
said
castanier
joyfully
the
man
who
can
do
it
all
gives
you
his
word
that
it
is
possible
answered
the
englishman
melmoth
castanier
and
mme
de
la
garde
were
standing
out
in
the
boulevard
when
melmoth
raised
his
arm
a
drizzling
rain
was
falling
the
streets
were
muddy
the
air
was
close
there
was
thick
darkness
overhead
but
in
a
moment
as
the
arm
was
outstretched
paris
was
filled
with
sunlight
it
was
high
noon
on
a
bright
july
day
the
trees
were
covered
with
leaves
a
double
stream
of
joyous
holiday
makers
strolled
beneath
them
sellers
of
liquorice
water
shouted
their
cool
drinks
splendid
carriages
rolled
past
along
the
streets
a
cry
of
terror
broke
from
the
cashier
and
at
that
cry
rain
and
darkness
once
more
settled
down
upon
the
boulevard
mme
de
la
garde
had
stepped
into
the
carriage
do
be
quick
dear
she
cried
either
come
in
or
stay
out
really
you
are
as
dull
as
this
evening
what
must
i
do
castanier
asked
of
melmoth
would
you
like
to
take
my
place
inquired
the
englishman
very
well
then
i
will
be
at
your
house
in
a
few
by
the
by
castanier
you
are
rather
off
your
balance
aquilina
remarked
there
is
some
mischief
brewing
you
were
quite
melancholy
and
thoughtful
all
through
the
play
do
you
want
anything
that
i
can
give
you
dear
tell
i
am
waiting
till
we
are
at
home
to
know
whether
you
love
you
need
not
wait
till
then
she
said
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
there
she
said
as
she
embraced
him
passionately
to
all
appearance
and
plied
him
with
the
coaxing
caresses
that
are
part
of
the
business
of
such
a
life
as
hers
like
stage
action
for
an
actress
where
is
the
music
asked
castanier
what
next
only
think
of
your
hearing
music
now
heavenly
music
he
went
on
the
sounds
seem
to
come
from
what
you
have
always
refused
to
give
me
a
box
at
the
italiens
because
you
could
not
abide
music
and
are
you
turning
at
this
time
of
day
mad
that
you
are
the
music
is
inside
your
own
noddle
old
she
went
on
as
she
took
his
head
in
her
hands
and
rocked
it
to
and
fro
on
her
shoulder
tell
me
now
old
man
isn
t
it
the
creaking
of
the
wheels
that
sings
in
your
ears
just
listen
naqui
if
the
angels
make
music
for
god
almighty
it
must
be
such
music
as
this
that
i
am
drinking
in
at
every
pore
rather
than
hearing
i
do
no
know
how
to
tell
you
about
it
it
is
as
sweet
as
why
of
course
they
have
music
in
heaven
for
the
angels
in
all
the
pictures
have
harps
in
their
hands
he
is
mad
upon
my
word
she
said
to
herself
as
she
saw
castanier
s
attitude
he
looked
like
an
in
a
blissful
trance
they
reached
the
house
castanier
absorbed
by
the
thought
of
all
that
he
had
just
heard
and
seen
knew
not
whether
to
believe
it
or
not
he
was
like
a
drunken
man
and
utterly
unable
to
think
connectedly
he
came
to
himself
in
aquilina
s
room
whither
he
had
been
supported
by
the
united
efforts
of
his
mistress
the
porter
and
jenny
for
he
had
fainted
as
he
stepped
from
the
carriage
will
be
here
directly
oh
my
friends
my
friends
he
cried
and
he
flung
himself
despairingly
into
the
depths
of
a
low
chair
beside
the
fire
jenny
heard
the
bell
as
he
spoke
and
admitted
the
englishman
she
announced
that
a
gentleman
had
come
who
had
made
an
appointment
with
the
master
when
melmoth
suddenly
appeared
and
deep
silence
followed
he
looked
at
the
porter
the
porter
went
he
looked
at
jenny
and
jenny
went
likewise
madame
said
melmoth
turning
to
aquilina
with
your
permission
we
will
conclude
a
piece
of
urgent
he
took
castanier
s
hand
and
castanier
rose
and
the
two
men
went
into
the
there
was
no
light
in
the
room
but
melmoth
s
eyes
lit
up
the
thickest
darkness
the
gaze
of
those
strange
eyes
had
left
aquilina
like
one
spellbound
she
was
helpless
unable
to
take
any
thought
for
her
lover
moreover
she
believed
him
to
be
safe
in
jenny
s
room
whereas
their
early
return
had
taken
the
by
surprise
and
she
had
hidden
the
officer
in
the
it
had
all
happened
exactly
as
in
the
drama
that
melmoth
had
displayed
for
his
victim
presently
the
was
slammed
violently
and
castanier
reappeared
what
ails
you
cried
the
aquilina
there
was
a
change
in
the
cashier
s
appearance
a
strange
pallor
overspread
his
once
rubicund
countenance
it
wore
the
peculiarly
sinister
and
stony
look
of
the
mysterious
visitor
the
sullen
glare
of
his
eyes
was
intolerable
the
fierce
light
in
them
seemed
to
scorch
the
man
who
had
looked
so
and
had
suddenly
grown
tyrannical
and
proud
the
courtesan
thought
that
castanier
had
grown
thinner
there
was
a
terrible
majesty
in
his
brow
it
was
as
if
a
dragon
breathed
forth
a
malignant
influence
that
weighed
upon
the
others
like
a
close
heavy
atmosphere
for
a
moment
aquilina
knew
not
what
to
do
what
has
passed
between
you
and
that
man
in
those
few
minutes
she
asked
at
length
i
have
sold
my
soul
to
him
i
feel
it
i
am
no
longer
the
same
he
has
taken
my
and
given
me
his
soul
in
what
you
would
not
understand
it
at
all
ah
he
was
right
castanier
went
on
the
fiend
was
right
i
see
everything
and
know
all
you
have
been
deceiving
me
aquilina
turned
cold
with
terror
castanier
lighted
a
candle
and
went
into
the
the
unhappy
girl
followed
him
with
dazed
bewilderment
and
great
was
her
astonishment
when
castanier
drew
the
dresses
that
hung
there
aside
and
disclosed
the
sergeant
come
out
my
boy
said
the
cashier
and
taking
leon
by
a
button
of
his
overcoat
he
drew
the
officer
into
his
room
the
piedmontese
haggard
and
desperate
had
flung
herself
into
her
castanier
seated
himself
on
a
sofa
by
the
fire
and
left
aquilina
s
lover
in
a
standing
position
you
have
been
in
the
army
said
leon
i
am
ready
to
give
you
you
are
a
fool
said
castanier
drily
i
have
no
occasion
to
fight
i
could
kill
you
by
a
look
if
i
had
any
mind
to
do
it
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
youngster
why
should
i
kill
you
i
can
see
a
red
line
round
your
neck
the
guillotine
is
waiting
for
you
yes
you
will
end
in
the
place
de
greve
you
are
the
headsman
s
property
there
is
no
escape
for
you
you
belong
to
a
vendita
of
the
carbonari
you
are
plotting
against
the
you
did
not
tell
me
that
cried
the
piedmontese
turning
to
leon
so
you
do
not
know
that
the
minister
decided
this
morning
to
put
down
your
society
the
cashier
continued
the
has
a
list
of
your
names
you
have
been
betrayed
they
are
busy
drawing
up
the
indictment
at
this
then
was
it
you
who
betrayed
him
cried
aquilina
and
with
a
hoarse
sound
in
her
throat
like
the
growl
of
a
tigress
she
rose
to
her
feet
she
seemed
as
if
she
would
tear
castanier
in
pieces
you
know
me
too
well
to
believe
it
castanier
retorted
aquilina
was
benumbed
by
his
coolness
then
how
do
you
know
it
she
murmured
i
did
not
know
it
until
i
went
into
the
now
i
know
it
now
i
see
and
know
all
things
and
can
do
all
the
sergeant
was
overcome
with
amazement
very
well
then
save
him
save
him
dear
cried
the
girl
flinging
herself
at
castanier
s
feet
if
nothing
is
impossible
to
you
save
him
i
will
love
you
i
will
adore
you
i
will
be
your
slave
and
not
your
mistress
i
will
obey
your
wildest
whims
you
shall
do
as
you
will
with
me
yes
yes
i
will
give
you
more
than
love
you
shall
have
a
daughter
s
devotion
as
well
as
rodolphe
why
will
you
not
understand
after
all
however
violent
my
passions
may
be
i
shall
be
yours
for
ever
what
should
i
say
to
persuade
you
i
will
invent
pleasures
i
great
heavens
one
moment
whatever
you
shall
ask
of
me
to
fling
myself
from
the
window
for
instance
you
will
need
to
say
but
one
word
leon
and
i
will
plunge
down
into
hell
i
would
bear
any
torture
any
pain
of
body
or
soul
anything
you
might
inflict
upon
me
castanier
heard
her
with
indifference
for
an
answer
he
indicated
leon
to
her
with
a
fiendish
laugh
the
guillotine
is
waiting
for
him
he
repeated
no
no
no
he
shall
not
leave
this
house
i
will
save
him
she
cried
yes
i
will
kill
any
one
who
lays
a
finger
upon
him
why
will
you
not
save
him
she
shrieked
aloud
her
eyes
were
blazing
her
hair
unbound
can
you
save
him
i
can
do
why
do
you
not
save
him
why
shouted
castanier
and
his
voice
made
the
ceiling
eh
it
is
my
revenge
doing
evil
is
my
trade
die
said
aquilina
must
he
die
my
lover
is
it
possible
she
sprang
up
and
snatched
a
stiletto
from
a
basket
that
stood
on
the
chest
of
drawers
and
went
to
castanier
who
now
began
to
laugh
you
know
very
well
that
steel
can
not
hurt
me
now
aquilina
s
arm
suddenly
dropped
like
a
snapped
harp
string
out
with
you
my
good
friend
said
the
cashier
turning
to
the
sergeant
and
go
about
your
he
held
out
his
hand
the
other
felt
castanier
s
superior
power
and
could
not
choose
but
to
obey
this
house
is
mine
i
could
send
for
the
commissary
of
police
if
i
chose
and
give
you
up
as
a
man
who
has
hidden
himself
on
my
premises
but
i
would
rather
let
you
go
i
am
a
fiend
i
am
not
a
i
shall
follow
him
said
aquilina
then
follow
him
returned
here
jenny
jenny
appeared
tell
the
porter
to
hail
a
cab
for
here
naqui
said
castanier
drawing
a
bundle
of
from
his
pocket
you
shall
not
go
away
like
a
pauper
from
a
man
who
loves
you
he
held
out
three
hundred
thousand
francs
aquilina
took
the
notes
flung
them
on
the
floor
spat
on
them
and
trampled
upon
them
in
a
frenzy
of
despair
we
will
leave
this
house
on
foot
she
cried
without
a
farthing
of
your
jenny
stay
where
you
answered
the
cashier
as
he
gathered
up
the
notes
again
i
have
come
back
from
my
jenny
he
added
looking
at
the
bewildered
you
seem
to
me
to
be
a
good
sort
of
girl
you
have
no
mistress
now
come
here
this
evening
you
shall
have
a
aquilina
who
felt
safe
nowhere
went
at
once
with
the
sergeant
to
the
house
of
one
of
her
friends
but
all
leon
s
movements
were
suspiciously
watched
by
the
police
and
after
a
time
he
and
three
of
his
friends
were
arrested
the
whole
story
may
be
found
in
the
newspapers
of
that
day
castanier
felt
that
he
had
undergone
a
mental
as
well
as
a
physical
transformation
the
castanier
of
old
no
longer
existed
the
boy
the
young
lothario
the
soldier
who
had
proved
his
courage
who
had
been
tricked
into
a
marriage
and
disillusioned
the
cashier
the
passionate
lover
who
had
committed
a
crime
for
aquilina
s
sake
his
inmost
nature
had
suddenly
asserted
itself
his
brain
had
expanded
his
senses
had
developed
his
thoughts
comprehended
the
whole
world
he
saw
all
the
things
of
earth
as
if
he
had
been
raised
to
some
high
pinnacle
above
the
world
until
that
evening
at
the
play
he
had
loved
aquilina
to
distraction
rather
than
give
her
up
he
would
have
shut
his
eyes
to
her
infidelities
and
now
all
that
blind
passion
had
passed
away
as
a
cloud
vanishes
in
the
sunlight
jenny
was
delighted
to
succeed
to
her
mistress
position
and
fortune
and
did
the
cashier
s
will
in
all
things
but
castanier
who
could
read
the
inmost
thoughts
of
the
soul
discovered
the
real
motive
underlying
this
purely
physical
devotion
he
amused
himself
with
her
however
like
a
mischievous
child
who
greedily
sucks
the
juice
of
the
cherry
and
flings
away
the
stone
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
time
when
she
was
fully
convinced
that
she
was
a
lady
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
castanier
uttered
one
by
one
the
thoughts
that
filled
her
mind
as
she
drank
her
coffee
do
you
know
what
you
are
thinking
child
he
said
smiling
i
will
tell
you
so
all
that
lovely
rosewood
furniture
that
i
coveted
so
much
and
the
pretty
dresses
that
i
used
to
try
on
are
mine
now
all
on
easy
terms
that
madame
refused
i
do
no
know
why
my
word
if
i
might
drive
about
in
a
carriage
have
jewels
and
pretty
things
a
box
at
the
theatre
and
put
something
by
with
me
he
should
lead
a
life
of
pleasure
fit
to
kill
him
if
he
were
not
as
strong
as
a
turk
i
never
saw
such
a
man
was
not
that
just
what
you
were
thinking
he
went
on
and
something
in
his
voice
made
jenny
turn
pale
well
yes
child
you
could
not
stand
it
and
i
am
sending
you
away
for
your
own
good
you
would
perish
in
the
attempt
come
let
us
part
good
friends
and
he
coolly
dismissed
her
with
a
very
small
sum
of
money
the
first
use
that
castanier
had
promised
himself
that
he
would
make
of
the
terrible
power
brought
at
the
price
of
his
eternal
happiness
was
the
full
and
complete
indulgence
of
all
his
tastes
he
first
put
his
affairs
in
order
readily
settled
his
accounts
with
de
nucingen
who
found
a
worthy
german
to
succeed
him
and
then
determined
on
a
carouse
worthy
of
the
palmiest
days
of
the
roman
empire
he
plunged
into
dissipation
as
recklessly
as
belshazzar
of
old
went
to
that
last
feast
in
babylon
like
belshazzar
he
saw
clearly
through
his
revels
a
gleaming
hand
that
traced
his
doom
in
letters
of
flame
not
on
the
narrow
walls
of
the
but
over
the
vast
spaces
of
heaven
that
the
rainbow
spans
his
feast
was
not
indeed
an
orgy
confined
within
the
limits
of
a
banquet
for
he
squandered
all
the
powers
of
soul
and
body
in
exhausting
all
the
pleasures
of
earth
the
table
was
in
some
sort
earth
itself
the
earth
that
trembled
beneath
his
feet
his
was
the
last
festival
of
the
reckless
spendthrift
who
has
thrown
all
prudence
to
the
winds
the
devil
had
given
him
the
key
of
the
storehouse
of
human
pleasures
he
had
filled
and
refilled
his
hands
and
he
was
fast
nearing
the
bottom
in
a
moment
he
had
felt
all
that
that
enormous
power
could
accomplish
in
a
moment
he
had
exercised
it
proved
it
wearied
of
it
what
had
hitherto
been
the
sum
of
human
desires
became
as
nothing
so
often
it
happens
that
with
possession
the
vast
poetry
of
desire
must
end
and
the
thing
possessed
is
seldom
the
thing
that
we
dreamed
of
beneath
melmoth
s
omnipotence
lurked
this
tragical
anticlimax
of
so
many
a
passion
and
now
the
inanity
of
human
nature
was
revealed
to
his
successor
to
whom
infinite
power
brought
nothingness
as
a
dowry
to
come
to
a
clear
understanding
of
castanier
s
strange
position
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
how
suddenly
these
revolutions
of
thought
and
feeling
had
been
wrought
how
quickly
they
had
succeeded
each
other
and
of
these
things
it
is
hard
to
give
any
idea
to
those
who
have
never
broken
the
prison
bonds
of
time
and
space
and
distance
his
relation
to
the
world
without
had
been
entirely
changed
with
the
expansion
of
his
faculties
like
melmoth
himself
castanier
could
travel
in
a
few
moments
over
the
fertile
plains
of
india
could
soar
on
the
wings
of
demons
above
african
desert
spaces
or
skim
the
surface
of
the
seas
the
same
insight
that
could
read
the
inmost
thoughts
of
others
could
apprehend
at
a
glance
the
nature
of
any
material
object
just
as
he
caught
as
it
were
all
flavors
at
once
upon
his
tongue
he
took
his
pleasure
like
a
despot
a
blow
of
the
axe
felled
the
tree
that
he
might
eat
its
fruits
the
transitions
the
alternations
that
measure
joy
and
pain
and
diversify
human
happiness
no
longer
existed
for
him
he
had
so
completely
glutted
his
appetites
that
pleasure
must
overpass
the
limits
of
pleasure
to
tickle
a
palate
cloyed
with
satiety
and
suddenly
grown
fastidious
beyond
all
measure
so
that
ordinary
pleasures
became
distasteful
conscious
that
at
will
he
was
the
master
of
all
the
women
that
he
could
desire
knowing
that
his
power
was
irresistible
he
did
not
care
to
exercise
it
they
were
pliant
to
his
unexpressed
wishes
to
his
most
extravagant
caprices
until
he
felt
a
horrible
thirst
for
love
and
would
have
love
beyond
their
power
to
give
the
world
refused
him
nothing
save
faith
and
prayer
the
soothing
and
consoling
love
that
is
not
of
this
world
he
was
obeyed
it
was
a
horrible
position
the
torrents
of
pain
and
pleasure
and
thought
that
shook
his
soul
and
his
bodily
frame
would
have
overwhelmed
the
strongest
human
being
but
in
him
there
was
a
power
of
vitality
proportioned
to
the
power
of
the
sensations
that
assailed
him
he
felt
within
him
a
vague
immensity
of
longing
that
earth
could
not
satisfy
he
spent
his
days
on
outspread
wings
longing
to
traverse
the
luminous
fields
of
space
to
other
spheres
that
he
knew
afar
by
intuitive
perception
a
clear
and
hopeless
knowledge
his
soul
dried
up
within
him
for
he
hungered
and
thirsted
after
things
that
can
neither
be
drunk
nor
eaten
but
for
which
he
could
not
choose
but
crave
his
lips
like
melmoth
s
burned
with
desire
he
panted
for
the
unknown
for
he
knew
all
things
the
mechanism
and
the
scheme
of
the
world
was
apparent
to
him
and
its
working
interested
him
no
longer
he
did
not
long
disguise
the
profound
scorn
that
makes
of
a
man
of
extraordinary
powers
a
sphinx
who
knows
everything
and
says
nothing
and
sees
all
things
with
an
unmoved
countenance
he
felt
not
the
slightest
wish
to
communicate
his
knowledge
to
other
men
he
was
rich
with
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
with
one
effort
he
could
make
the
circle
of
the
globe
and
riches
and
power
were
meaningless
for
him
he
felt
the
awful
melancholy
of
omnipotence
a
melancholy
which
satan
and
god
relieve
by
the
exercise
of
infinite
power
in
mysterious
ways
known
to
them
alone
castanier
had
not
like
his
master
the
inextinguishable
energy
of
hate
and
malice
he
felt
that
he
was
a
devil
but
a
devil
whose
time
was
not
yet
come
while
satan
is
a
devil
through
all
eternity
and
being
damned
beyond
redemption
delights
to
stir
up
the
world
like
a
dung
heap
with
his
triple
fork
and
to
thwart
therein
the
designs
of
god
but
castanier
for
his
misfortune
had
one
hope
left
if
in
a
moment
he
could
move
from
one
pole
to
the
other
as
a
bird
springs
restlessly
from
side
to
side
in
its
cage
when
like
the
bird
he
has
crossed
his
prison
he
saw
the
vast
immensity
of
space
beyond
it
that
vision
of
the
infinite
left
him
for
ever
unable
to
see
humanity
and
its
affairs
as
other
men
saw
them
the
insensate
fools
who
long
for
the
power
of
the
devil
gauge
its
desirability
from
a
human
standpoint
they
do
not
see
that
with
the
devil
s
power
they
will
likewise
assume
his
thoughts
and
that
they
will
be
doomed
to
remain
as
men
among
creatures
who
will
no
longer
understand
them
the
nero
unknown
to
history
who
dreams
of
setting
paris
on
fire
for
his
private
entertainment
like
an
exhibition
of
a
burning
house
on
the
boards
of
a
theatre
does
not
suspect
that
if
he
had
the
power
paris
would
become
for
him
as
little
interesting
as
an
by
the
roadside
to
a
hurrying
the
circle
of
the
sciences
was
for
castanier
something
like
a
logogriph
for
a
man
who
does
not
know
the
key
to
it
kings
and
governments
were
despicable
in
his
eyes
his
great
debauch
had
been
in
some
sort
a
deplorable
farewell
to
his
life
as
a
man
the
earth
had
grown
too
narrow
for
him
for
the
infernal
gifts
laid
bare
for
him
the
secrets
of
creation
he
saw
the
cause
and
foresaw
its
end
he
was
shut
out
from
all
that
men
call
heaven
in
all
languages
under
the
sun
he
could
no
longer
think
of
heaven
then
he
came
to
understand
the
look
on
his
predecessor
s
face
and
the
drying
up
of
the
life
within
then
he
knew
all
that
was
meant
by
the
baffled
hope
that
gleamed
in
melmoth
s
eyes
he
too
knew
the
thirst
that
burned
those
red
lips
and
the
agony
of
a
continual
struggle
between
two
natures
grown
to
giant
size
even
yet
he
might
be
an
angel
and
he
knew
himself
to
be
a
fiend
his
was
the
fate
of
a
sweet
and
gentle
creature
that
a
wizard
s
malice
has
imprisoned
in
a
form
entrapping
it
by
a
pact
so
that
another
s
will
must
set
it
free
from
its
detested
envelope
as
a
deception
only
increases
the
ardor
with
which
a
man
of
really
great
nature
explores
the
infinite
of
sentiment
in
a
woman
s
heart
so
castanier
awoke
to
find
that
one
idea
lay
like
a
weight
upon
his
soul
an
idea
which
was
perhaps
the
key
to
loftier
spheres
the
very
fact
that
he
had
bartered
away
his
eternal
happiness
led
him
to
dwell
in
thought
upon
the
future
of
those
who
pray
and
believe
on
the
morrow
of
his
debauch
when
he
entered
into
the
sober
possession
of
his
power
this
idea
made
him
feel
himself
a
prisoner
he
knew
the
burden
of
the
woe
that
poets
and
prophets
and
great
oracles
of
faith
have
set
forth
for
us
in
such
mighty
words
he
felt
the
point
of
the
flaming
sword
plunged
into
his
side
and
hurried
in
search
of
melmoth
what
had
become
of
his
predecessor
the
englishman
was
living
in
a
mansion
in
the
rue
ferou
near
a
gloomy
dark
damp
and
cold
abode
the
rue
ferou
itself
is
one
of
the
most
dismal
streets
in
paris
it
has
a
north
aspect
like
all
the
streets
that
lie
at
right
angles
to
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
and
the
houses
are
in
keeping
with
the
site
as
castanier
stood
on
the
threshold
he
found
that
the
door
itself
like
the
vaulted
roof
was
hung
with
black
rows
of
lighted
tapers
shone
brilliantly
as
though
some
king
were
lying
in
state
and
a
priest
stood
on
either
side
of
a
catafalque
that
had
been
raised
there
there
is
no
need
to
ask
why
you
have
come
sir
the
old
hall
porter
said
to
castanier
you
are
so
like
our
poor
dear
master
that
is
gone
but
if
you
are
his
brother
you
have
come
too
late
to
bid
him
the
good
gentleman
died
the
night
before
how
did
he
die
castanier
asked
of
one
of
the
priests
set
your
mind
at
rest
said
the
old
priest
he
partly
raised
as
he
spoke
the
black
pall
that
covered
the
catafalque
castanier
looking
at
him
saw
one
of
those
faces
that
faith
has
made
sublime
the
soul
seemed
to
shine
forth
from
every
line
of
it
bringing
light
and
warmth
for
other
men
kindled
by
the
unfailing
charity
within
this
was
sir
john
melmoth
s
confessor
your
brother
made
an
end
that
men
may
envy
and
that
must
rejoice
the
angels
do
you
know
what
joy
there
is
in
heaven
over
a
sinner
that
repents
his
tears
of
penitence
excited
by
grace
flowed
without
ceasing
death
alone
checked
them
the
holy
spirit
dwelt
in
him
his
burning
words
full
of
lively
faith
were
worthy
of
the
if
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
have
never
heard
a
more
dreadful
confession
than
from
the
lips
of
this
irish
gentleman
i
have
likewise
never
heard
such
fervent
and
passionate
prayers
however
great
the
measures
of
his
sins
may
have
been
his
repentance
has
filled
the
abyss
to
overflowing
the
hand
of
god
was
visibly
stretched
out
above
him
for
he
was
completely
changed
there
was
such
heavenly
beauty
in
his
face
the
hard
eyes
were
softened
by
tears
the
resonant
voice
that
struck
terror
into
those
who
heard
it
took
the
tender
and
compassionate
tones
of
those
who
themselves
have
passed
through
deep
humiliation
he
so
edified
those
who
heard
his
words
that
some
who
had
felt
drawn
to
see
the
spectacle
of
a
christian
s
death
fell
on
their
knees
as
he
spoke
of
heavenly
things
and
of
the
infinite
glory
of
god
and
gave
thanks
and
praise
to
him
if
he
is
leaving
no
worldly
wealth
to
his
family
no
family
can
possess
a
greater
blessing
than
this
that
he
surely
gained
for
them
a
soul
among
the
blessed
who
will
watch
over
you
all
and
direct
you
in
the
path
to
these
words
made
such
a
vivid
impression
upon
castanier
that
he
instantly
hurried
from
the
house
to
the
church
of
obeying
what
might
be
called
a
decree
of
fate
melmoth
s
repentance
had
stupefied
him
at
that
time
on
certain
mornings
in
the
week
a
preacher
famed
for
his
eloquence
was
wont
to
hold
conferences
in
the
course
of
which
he
demonstrated
the
truths
of
the
catholic
faith
for
the
youth
of
a
generation
proclaimed
to
be
indifferent
in
matters
of
belief
by
another
voice
no
less
eloquent
than
his
own
the
conference
had
been
put
off
to
a
later
hour
on
account
of
melmoth
s
funeral
so
castanier
arrived
just
as
the
great
preacher
was
epitomizing
the
proofs
of
a
future
existence
of
happiness
with
all
the
charm
of
eloquence
and
force
of
expression
which
have
made
him
famous
the
seeds
of
divine
doctrine
fell
into
a
soil
prepared
for
them
in
the
old
dragoon
into
whom
the
devil
had
glided
indeed
if
there
is
a
phenomenon
well
attested
by
experience
is
it
not
the
spiritual
phenomenon
commonly
called
the
faith
of
the
peasant
the
strength
of
belief
varies
inversely
with
the
amount
of
use
that
a
man
has
made
of
his
reasoning
faculties
simple
people
and
soldiers
belong
to
the
unreasoning
class
those
who
have
marched
through
life
beneath
the
banner
of
instinct
are
far
more
ready
to
receive
the
light
than
minds
and
hearts
overwearied
with
the
world
s
sophistries
castanier
had
the
southern
temperament
he
had
joined
the
army
as
a
lad
of
sixteen
and
had
followed
the
french
flag
till
he
was
nearly
forty
years
old
as
a
common
trooper
he
had
fought
day
and
night
and
day
after
day
and
as
in
duty
bound
had
thought
of
his
horse
first
and
of
himself
afterwards
while
he
served
his
military
apprenticeship
therefore
he
had
but
little
leisure
in
which
to
reflect
on
the
destiny
of
man
and
when
he
became
an
officer
he
had
his
men
to
think
of
he
had
been
swept
from
battlefield
to
battlefield
but
he
had
never
thought
of
what
comes
after
death
a
soldier
s
life
does
not
demand
much
thinking
those
who
can
not
understand
the
lofty
political
ends
involved
and
the
interests
of
nation
and
nation
who
can
not
grasp
political
schemes
as
well
as
plans
of
campaign
and
combine
the
science
of
the
tactician
with
that
of
the
administrator
are
bound
to
live
in
a
state
of
ignorance
the
most
boorish
peasant
in
the
most
backward
district
in
france
is
scarcely
in
a
worse
case
such
men
as
these
bear
the
brunt
of
war
yield
passive
obedience
to
the
brain
that
directs
them
and
strike
down
the
men
opposed
to
them
as
the
woodcutter
fells
timber
in
the
forest
violent
physical
exertion
is
succeeded
by
times
of
inertia
when
they
repair
the
waste
they
fight
and
drink
fight
and
eat
fight
and
sleep
that
they
may
the
better
deal
hard
blows
the
powers
of
the
mind
are
not
greatly
exercised
in
this
turbulent
round
of
existence
and
the
character
is
as
simple
as
heretofore
when
the
men
who
have
shown
such
energy
on
the
battlefield
return
to
ordinary
civilization
most
of
those
who
have
not
risen
to
high
rank
seem
to
have
acquired
no
ideas
and
to
have
no
aptitude
no
capacity
for
grasping
new
ideas
to
the
utter
amazement
of
a
younger
generation
those
who
made
our
armies
so
glorious
and
so
terrible
are
as
simple
as
children
and
as
as
a
clerk
at
his
worst
and
the
captain
of
a
thundering
squadron
is
scarcely
fit
to
keep
a
merchant
s
old
soldiers
of
this
stamp
therefore
being
innocent
of
any
attempt
to
use
their
reasoning
faculties
act
upon
their
strongest
impulses
castanier
s
crime
was
one
of
those
matters
that
raise
so
many
questions
that
in
order
to
debate
about
it
a
moralist
might
call
for
its
discussion
by
clauses
to
make
use
of
a
parliamentary
expression
passion
had
counseled
the
crime
the
cruelly
irresistible
power
of
feminine
witchery
had
driven
him
to
commit
it
no
man
can
say
of
himself
i
will
never
do
that
when
a
siren
joins
in
the
combat
and
throws
her
spells
over
him
so
the
word
of
life
fell
upon
a
conscience
newly
awakened
to
the
truths
of
religion
which
the
french
revolution
and
a
soldier
s
career
had
forced
castanier
to
neglect
the
solemn
words
you
will
be
happy
or
miserable
for
all
eternity
made
but
the
more
terrible
impression
upon
him
because
he
had
exhausted
earth
and
shaken
it
like
a
barren
tree
because
his
desires
could
effect
all
things
so
that
it
was
enough
that
any
spot
in
earth
or
heaven
should
be
forbidden
him
and
he
forthwith
thought
of
nothing
else
if
it
were
allowable
to
compare
such
great
things
with
social
follies
castanier
s
position
was
not
unlike
that
of
a
banker
who
finding
that
his
millions
can
not
obtain
for
him
an
entrance
into
the
society
of
the
noblesse
must
set
his
heart
upon
entering
that
circle
and
all
the
social
privileges
that
he
has
already
acquired
are
as
nothing
in
his
eyes
from
the
moment
when
he
discovers
that
a
single
one
is
lacking
here
is
a
man
more
powerful
than
all
the
kings
on
earth
put
together
a
man
who
like
satan
could
wrestle
with
god
himself
leaning
against
one
of
the
pillars
in
the
church
of
weighed
down
by
the
feelings
and
thoughts
that
oppressed
him
and
absorbed
in
the
thought
of
a
future
the
same
thought
that
had
engulfed
melmoth
he
was
very
happy
was
melmoth
cried
castanier
he
died
in
the
certain
knowledge
that
he
would
go
to
in
a
moment
the
greatest
possible
change
had
been
wrought
in
the
cashier
s
ideas
for
several
days
he
had
been
a
devil
now
he
was
nothing
but
a
man
an
image
of
the
fallen
adam
of
the
sacred
tradition
embodied
in
all
cosmogonies
but
while
he
had
thus
shrunk
he
retained
a
germ
of
greatness
he
had
been
steeped
in
the
infinite
the
power
of
hell
had
revealed
the
divine
power
he
thirsted
for
heaven
as
he
had
never
thirsted
after
the
pleasures
of
earth
that
are
so
soon
exhausted
the
enjoyments
which
the
fiend
promises
are
but
the
enjoyments
of
earth
on
a
larger
scale
but
to
the
joys
of
heaven
there
is
no
limit
he
believed
in
god
and
the
spell
that
gave
him
the
treasures
of
the
world
was
as
nothing
to
him
now
the
treasures
themselves
seemed
to
him
as
contemptible
as
pebbles
to
an
admirer
of
diamonds
they
were
but
gewgaws
compared
with
the
eternal
glories
of
the
other
life
a
curse
lay
he
thought
on
all
things
that
came
to
him
from
this
source
he
sounded
dark
depths
of
painful
thought
as
he
listened
to
the
service
performed
for
melmoth
the
filled
him
with
awe
he
felt
all
the
grandeur
of
that
cry
of
a
repentant
soul
trembling
before
the
throne
of
god
the
holy
spirit
like
a
devouring
flame
passed
through
him
as
fire
consumes
straw
the
tears
were
falling
from
his
eyes
when
are
you
a
relation
of
the
dead
the
beadle
asked
him
i
am
his
heir
castanier
answered
give
something
for
the
expenses
of
the
services
cried
the
man
no
said
the
cashier
the
devil
s
money
should
not
go
to
the
church
for
the
poor
for
repairing
the
church
the
lady
chapel
for
the
schools
castanier
went
not
caring
to
expose
himself
to
the
sour
looks
that
the
irritated
functionaries
gave
him
outside
in
the
street
he
looked
up
at
the
church
of
what
made
people
build
the
giant
cathedrals
i
have
seen
in
every
country
he
asked
himself
the
feeling
shared
so
widely
throughout
all
time
must
surely
be
based
upon
something
do
you
call
god
cried
his
conscience
god
god
god
the
word
was
echoed
and
by
an
inner
voice
til
it
overwhelmed
him
but
his
feeling
of
terror
subsided
as
he
heard
sweet
distant
sounds
of
music
that
he
had
caught
faintly
before
they
were
singing
in
the
church
he
thought
and
his
eyes
scanned
the
great
doorway
but
as
he
listened
more
closely
the
sounds
poured
upon
him
from
all
sides
he
looked
round
the
square
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
musicians
the
melody
brought
visions
of
a
distant
heaven
and
gleams
of
hope
but
it
also
quickened
the
remorse
that
had
set
the
lost
soul
in
a
ferment
he
went
on
his
way
through
paris
walking
as
men
walk
who
are
crushed
beneath
the
burden
of
their
sorrow
seeing
everything
with
unseeing
eyes
loitering
like
an
idler
stopping
without
cause
muttering
to
himself
careless
of
the
traffic
making
no
effort
to
avoid
a
blow
from
a
plank
of
timber
imperceptibly
repentance
brought
him
under
the
influence
of
the
divine
grace
that
soothes
while
it
bruises
the
heart
so
terribly
his
face
came
to
wear
a
look
of
melmoth
something
great
with
a
trace
of
madness
in
the
greatness
a
look
of
dull
and
hopeless
distress
mingled
with
the
excited
eagerness
of
hope
and
beneath
it
all
a
gnawing
sense
of
loathing
for
all
that
the
world
can
give
the
humblest
of
prayers
lurked
in
the
eyes
that
saw
with
such
dreadful
clearness
his
power
was
the
measure
of
his
anguish
his
body
was
bowed
down
by
the
fearful
storm
that
shook
his
soul
as
the
tall
pines
bend
before
the
blast
like
his
predecessor
he
could
not
refuse
to
bear
the
burden
of
life
he
was
afraid
to
die
while
he
bore
the
yoke
of
hell
the
torment
grew
intolerable
at
last
one
morning
he
bethought
himself
how
that
melmoth
now
among
the
blessed
had
made
the
proposal
of
an
exchange
and
how
that
he
had
accepted
it
others
doubtless
would
follow
his
example
for
in
an
age
proclaimed
by
the
inheritors
of
the
eloquence
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
to
be
fatally
indifferent
to
religion
it
should
be
easy
to
find
a
man
who
would
accept
the
conditions
of
the
contract
in
order
to
prove
its
advantages
there
is
one
place
where
you
can
learn
what
kings
will
fetch
in
the
market
where
nations
are
weighed
in
the
balance
and
systems
appraised
where
the
value
of
a
government
is
stated
in
terms
of
the
piece
where
ideas
and
beliefs
have
their
price
and
everything
is
discounted
where
god
himself
in
a
manner
borrows
on
the
security
of
his
revenue
of
souls
for
the
pope
has
a
running
account
there
is
it
not
there
that
i
should
go
to
traffic
in
souls
castanier
went
quite
joyously
on
change
thinking
that
it
would
be
as
easy
to
buy
a
soul
as
to
invest
money
in
the
funds
any
ordinary
person
would
have
feared
ridicule
but
castanier
knew
by
experience
that
a
desperate
man
takes
everything
seriously
a
prisoner
lying
under
sentence
of
death
would
listen
to
the
madman
who
should
tell
him
that
by
pronouncing
some
gibberish
he
could
escape
through
the
keyhole
for
suffering
is
credulous
and
clings
to
an
idea
until
it
fails
as
the
swimmer
borne
along
by
the
current
clings
to
the
branch
that
snaps
in
his
hand
towards
four
o
clock
that
afternoon
castanier
appeared
among
the
little
knots
of
men
who
were
transacting
private
business
after
change
he
was
personally
known
to
some
of
the
brokers
and
while
affecting
to
be
in
search
of
an
acquaintance
he
managed
to
pick
up
the
current
gossip
and
rumors
of
failure
catch
me
negotiating
bills
for
claparon
my
boy
the
bank
collector
went
round
to
return
their
acceptances
to
them
this
morning
said
a
fat
banker
in
his
outspoken
way
if
you
have
any
of
their
paper
look
claparon
was
in
the
building
in
deep
consultation
with
a
man
well
known
for
the
ruinous
rate
at
which
he
lent
money
castanier
went
forthwith
in
search
of
the
said
claparon
a
merchant
who
had
a
reputation
for
taking
heavy
risks
that
meant
wealth
or
utter
ruin
the
walked
away
as
castanier
came
up
a
gesture
betrayed
the
speculator
s
despair
well
claparon
the
bank
wants
a
hundred
thousand
francs
of
you
and
it
is
four
o
clock
the
thing
is
known
and
it
is
too
late
to
arrange
your
little
failure
comfortably
said
castanier
sir
speak
lower
the
cashier
went
on
how
if
i
were
to
propose
a
piece
of
business
that
would
bring
you
in
as
much
money
as
you
require
it
would
not
discharge
my
liabilities
every
business
that
i
ever
heard
of
wants
a
little
time
to
simmer
i
know
of
something
that
will
set
you
straight
in
a
moment
answered
castanier
but
first
you
would
have
to
do
what
sell
your
share
of
paradise
it
is
a
matter
of
business
like
anything
else
isn
t
it
we
all
hold
shares
in
the
great
speculation
of
i
tell
you
this
said
claparon
angrily
that
i
am
just
the
man
to
lend
you
a
slap
in
the
face
when
a
man
is
in
trouble
it
is
no
time
to
pay
silly
jokes
on
i
am
talking
seriously
said
castanier
and
he
drew
a
bundle
of
notes
from
his
pocket
in
the
first
place
said
claparon
i
am
not
going
to
sell
my
soul
to
the
devil
for
a
trifle
i
want
five
hundred
thousand
francs
before
i
strike
who
talks
of
stinting
you
asked
castanier
cutting
him
short
you
shall
have
more
gold
than
you
could
stow
in
the
cellars
of
the
bank
of
he
held
out
a
handful
of
notes
that
decided
claparon
done
he
cried
but
how
is
the
bargain
to
be
make
let
us
go
over
yonder
no
one
is
standing
there
said
castanier
pointing
to
a
corner
of
the
court
claparon
and
his
tempter
exchanged
a
few
words
with
their
faces
turned
to
the
wall
none
of
the
onlookers
guessed
the
nature
of
this
though
their
curiosity
was
keenly
excited
by
the
strange
gestures
of
the
two
contracting
parties
when
castanier
returned
there
was
a
sudden
outburst
of
amazed
exclamation
as
in
the
assembly
where
the
least
event
immediately
attracts
attention
all
faces
were
turned
to
the
two
men
who
had
caused
the
sensation
and
a
shiver
passed
through
all
beholders
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
them
the
men
who
form
the
moving
crowd
that
fills
the
stock
exchange
are
soon
known
to
each
other
by
sight
they
watch
each
other
like
players
round
a
some
shrewd
observers
can
tell
how
a
man
will
play
and
the
condition
of
his
exchequer
from
a
survey
of
his
face
and
the
stock
exchange
is
simply
a
vast
every
one
therefore
had
noticed
claparon
and
castanier
the
latter
like
the
irishman
before
him
had
been
muscular
and
powerful
his
eyes
were
full
of
light
his
color
high
the
dignity
and
power
in
his
face
had
struck
awe
into
them
all
they
wondered
how
old
castanier
had
come
by
it
and
now
they
beheld
castanier
divested
of
his
power
shrunken
wrinkled
aged
and
feeble
he
had
drawn
claparon
out
of
the
crowd
with
the
energy
of
a
sick
man
in
a
fever
fit
he
had
looked
like
an
during
the
brief
period
of
excitement
that
the
drug
can
give
now
on
his
return
he
seemed
to
be
in
the
condition
of
utter
exhaustion
in
which
the
patient
dies
after
the
fever
departs
or
to
be
suffering
from
the
horrible
prostration
that
follows
on
excessive
indulgence
in
the
delights
of
narcotics
the
infernal
power
that
had
upheld
him
through
his
debauches
had
left
him
and
the
body
was
left
unaided
and
alone
to
endure
the
agony
of
remorse
and
the
heavy
burden
of
sincere
repentance
claparon
s
troubles
every
one
could
guess
but
claparon
reappeared
on
the
other
hand
with
sparkling
eyes
holding
his
head
high
with
the
pride
of
lucifer
the
crisis
had
passed
from
the
one
man
to
the
other
now
you
can
drop
off
with
an
easy
mind
old
man
said
claparon
to
castanier
for
pity
s
sake
send
for
a
cab
and
for
a
priest
send
for
the
curate
of
answered
the
old
dragoon
sinking
down
upon
the
curbstone
the
words
a
priest
reached
the
ears
of
several
people
and
produced
uproarious
jeering
among
the
stockbrokers
for
faith
with
these
gentlemen
means
a
belief
that
a
scrap
of
paper
called
a
mortgage
represents
an
estate
and
the
list
of
fundholders
is
their
bible
shall
i
have
time
to
repent
said
castanier
to
himself
in
a
piteous
voice
that
impressed
claparon
a
cab
carried
away
the
dying
man
the
speculator
went
to
the
bank
at
once
to
meet
his
bills
and
the
momentary
sensation
produced
upon
the
throng
of
business
men
by
the
sudden
change
on
the
two
faces
vanished
like
the
furrow
cut
by
a
ship
s
keel
in
the
sea
news
of
the
greatest
importance
kept
the
attention
of
the
world
of
commerce
on
the
alert
and
when
commercial
interests
are
at
stake
moses
might
appear
with
his
two
luminous
horns
and
his
coming
would
scarcely
receive
the
honors
of
a
pun
the
gentlemen
whose
business
it
is
to
write
the
market
reports
would
ignore
his
existence
when
claparon
had
made
his
payments
fear
seized
upon
him
there
was
no
mistake
about
his
power
he
went
on
change
again
and
offered
his
bargain
to
other
men
in
embarrassed
circumstances
the
devil
s
bond
together
with
the
rights
easements
and
privileges
appertaining
thereunto
to
use
the
expression
of
the
notary
who
succeeded
claparon
changed
hands
for
the
sum
of
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
the
notary
in
his
turn
parted
with
the
agreement
with
the
devil
for
five
hundred
thousand
francs
to
a
building
contractor
in
difficulties
who
likewise
was
rid
of
it
to
an
iron
merchant
in
consideration
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
fact
by
five
o
clock
people
had
ceased
to
believe
in
the
strange
contract
and
purchasers
were
lacking
for
want
of
confidence
at
five
the
holder
of
the
bond
was
a
who
was
lounging
by
the
door
of
the
building
in
the
rue
feydeau
where
at
that
time
stockbrokers
temporarily
congregated
the
simple
fellow
could
not
think
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
felt
all
anyhow
so
he
told
his
wife
when
he
went
home
the
rue
feydeau
as
idlers
about
town
are
aware
is
a
place
of
pilgrimage
for
youths
who
for
lack
of
a
mistress
bestow
their
ardent
affection
upon
the
whole
sex
on
the
first
floor
of
the
most
rigidly
respectable
domicile
therein
dwelt
one
of
those
exquisite
creatures
whom
it
has
pleased
heaven
to
endow
with
the
rarest
and
most
surpassing
beauty
as
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
all
be
duchesses
or
queens
since
there
are
many
more
pretty
women
in
the
world
than
titles
and
thrones
for
them
to
adorn
they
are
content
to
make
a
stockbroker
or
a
banker
happy
at
a
fixed
price
to
this
beauty
euphrasia
by
name
an
unbounded
ambition
had
led
a
notary
s
clerk
to
aspire
in
short
the
second
clerk
in
the
office
of
maitre
crottat
notary
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
as
youth
at
can
fall
in
love
the
scrivener
would
have
murdered
the
pope
and
run
amuck
through
the
whole
sacred
college
to
procure
the
miserable
sum
of
a
hundred
louis
to
pay
for
a
shawl
which
had
turned
euphrasia
s
head
at
which
price
her
had
promised
that
euphrasia
should
be
his
the
infatuated
youth
walked
to
and
fro
under
madame
euphrasia
s
windows
like
the
polar
bears
in
their
cage
at
the
jardin
des
plantes
with
his
right
hand
thrust
beneath
his
waistcoat
in
the
region
of
the
heart
which
he
was
fit
to
tear
from
his
bosom
but
as
yet
he
had
only
wrenched
at
the
elastic
of
his
braces
what
can
one
do
to
raise
ten
thousand
francs
he
asked
himself
shall
i
make
off
with
the
money
that
i
must
pay
on
the
registration
of
that
conveyance
good
heavens
my
loan
would
not
ruin
the
purchaser
a
man
with
seven
millions
and
then
next
day
i
would
fling
myself
at
his
feet
and
say
i
have
taken
ten
thousand
francs
belonging
to
you
sir
i
am
years
of
age
and
i
am
in
love
with
euphrasia
that
is
my
story
my
father
is
rich
he
will
pay
you
back
do
not
ruin
me
have
not
you
yourself
been
years
old
and
madly
in
love
but
these
beggarly
landowners
have
no
souls
he
would
be
quite
likely
to
give
me
up
to
the
public
prosecutor
instead
of
taking
pity
upon
me
good
god
if
it
were
only
possible
to
sell
your
soul
to
the
devil
but
there
is
neither
a
god
nor
a
devil
it
is
all
nonsense
out
of
nursery
tales
and
old
wives
talk
what
shall
i
do
if
you
have
a
mind
to
sell
your
soul
to
the
devil
sir
said
the
who
had
overheard
something
that
the
clerk
let
fall
you
can
have
the
ten
thousand
and
euphrasia
cried
the
clerk
as
he
struck
a
bargain
with
the
devil
that
inhabited
the
the
pact
concluded
the
frantic
clerk
went
to
find
the
shawl
and
mounted
madame
euphrasia
s
staircase
and
as
literally
the
devil
was
in
him
he
did
not
come
down
for
twelve
days
drowning
the
thought
of
hell
and
of
his
privileges
in
twelve
days
of
love
and
riot
and
forgetfulness
for
which
he
had
bartered
away
all
his
hopes
of
a
paradise
to
come
and
in
this
way
the
secret
of
the
vast
power
discovered
and
acquired
by
the
irishman
the
offspring
of
maturin
s
brain
was
lost
to
mankind
and
the
various
orientalists
mystics
and
archaeologists
who
take
an
interest
in
these
matters
were
unable
to
hand
down
to
posterity
the
proper
method
of
invoking
the
devil
for
the
following
sufficient
reasons
on
the
thirteenth
day
after
these
frenzied
nuptials
the
wretched
clerk
lay
on
a
pallet
bed
in
a
garret
in
his
master
s
house
in
the
rue
shame
the
stupid
goddess
who
dares
not
behold
herself
had
taken
possession
of
the
young
man
he
had
fallen
ill
he
would
nurse
himself
misjudged
the
quantity
of
a
remedy
devised
by
the
skill
of
a
practitioner
well
known
on
the
walls
of
paris
and
succumbed
to
the
effects
of
an
overdose
of
mercury
his
corpse
was
as
black
as
a
mole
s
back
a
devil
had
left
unmistakable
traces
of
its
passage

could

estimable
youth
to
whom
you
refer

been

said
the
head
clerk
to

demonologist

came
to
investigate
the
matter
at
first
hand
i
am
quite
prepared
to
believe
it
answered
the
teuton
oh
yes
sir
returned
the
other
the
opinion
you
advance
coincides
with
the
very
words
of
jacob
boehme

proposition
of

nature

is
formed

the
spirit
born

of
what

sir

his
quotation
