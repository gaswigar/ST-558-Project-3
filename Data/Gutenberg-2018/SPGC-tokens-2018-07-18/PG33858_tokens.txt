introduction
the
translation
here
presented
to
the
public
is
intended
rather
as
a
contribution
to
the
history
or
perhaps
it
should
be
said
the
sociology
of
the
momentous
period
to
which
the
romance
of
simplicissimus
belongs
than
as
a
specimen
of
literature
effective
though
its
situations
are
consistent
and
artistic
though
its
composition
is
up
to
a
certain
point
its
interest
lies
chiefly
in
the
pictures
or
rather
photographs
of
contemporary
manners
and
characters
which
it
presents
it
has
been
said
with
some
truth
that
if
succeeding
romancers
had
striven
as
perseveringly
as
our
author
to
embody
the
spirit
and
reflect
the
ways
of
the
people
german
fiction
might
long
ago
have
reached
as
high
a
development
as
the
english
novel
as
it
is
there
is
little
of
such
spirit
to
be
discovered
in
the
prose
romances
which
appeared
between
the
time
of
grimmelshausen
and
that
of
jean
paul
richter
but
the
influence
of
the
latter
was
completely
swept
away
in
the
torrent
of
idealism
by
which
the
fictions
of
the
idolised
goethe
and
his
followers
were
characterised
and
his
domestic
realism
has
only
of
late
made
its
reappearance
in
disquieting
and
sordid
forms
it
should
be
remembered
as
an
apology
for
the
stress
now
laid
upon
the
sociological
side
of
the
history
of
the
thirty
years
war
that
that
side
has
by
historians
been
resolutely
thrust
into
the
background
the
most
detailed
and
painstaking
narratives
of
the
war
are
either
bare
records
of
military
operations
or
worse
still
represent
merely
meticulous
and
valueless
unravellings
of
the
web
of
intrigue
with
which
the
pedants
of
the
time
deceived
themselves
into
the
belief
that
they
were
very
machiavels
of
subtlety
and
resource
while
the
empire
was
bleeding
to
death
the
chancelleries
of
half
europe
were
intent
on
the
detaching
from
one
side
or
the
other
of
a
venal
general
or
the
patching
up
of
some
partial
armistice
that
might
afford
to
organise
further
mischief
it
does
not
matter
much
to
any
one
whether
wallenstein
was
knave
or
fool
but
it
did
matter
and
does
matter
that
the
war
crippled
for
two
hundred
years
the
finances
the
agriculture
and
the
enterprise
of
the
german
people
and
dealt
a
blow
to
their
patriotism
from
the
like
of
which
few
nations
could
have
recovered
even
the
character
of
the
civil
administration
was
completely
altered
when
the
struggle
ended
an
army
of
capable
bourgeois
secretaries
and
councillors
had
for
centuries
served
their
princes
and
their
fellow
subjects
well
it
is
wonderful
that
throughout
the
devastating
wars
waged
by
wallenstein
and
weimar
and
even
later
on
during
the
organised
raids
of
wrangel
and
königsmark
the
records
were
kept
the
village
business
administered
where
there
was
a
village
left
and
even
revenue
collected
with
wellnigh
as
much
regularity
as
in
time
of
peace
these
functionaries
who
had
worked
so
well
were
at
the
end
of
the
war
gradually
dispossessed
of
their
influence
and
their
posts
were
taken
by
a
swarm
of
young
of
noble
birth
whom
the
peace
had
deprived
of
their
proper
employment
and
whose
pride
was
only
equalled
by
their
incapacity
but
neither
particulars
nor
generalisations
bearing
on
such
subjects
are
to
be
found
in
the
pages
of
professional
historians
they
must
be
sought
in
the
contemporary
records
of
the
people
of
which
the
present
work
affords
one
of
the
few
existing
specimens
or
else
in
the
work
of
picturesque
writers
who
laying
no
claim
to
the
title
of
scientific
investigators
yet
possess
the
power
of
selecting
salient
facts
and
deducing
broad
conclusions
from
them

study
which
has
as
yet
been
but
charily
used
and
recent
german
works
dealing
directly
with
the
subject
are
more
remarkable
for
elegance
of
production
than
for
depth
of
research
such
being
the
purpose
for
which
this
translation
has
been
undertaken
an
introduction
to
it
must
necessarily
be
concerned
not
so
much
with
the
bibliography
of
the
book
or
even
the
sources
if
any
to
which
the
author
was
beholden
for
his
material
as
with
his
own
personality
and
the
amount
of
actual
fact
that
underlies
the
narrative
of
the
fictitious
hero
adventures
in
respect
of
the
first
point
we
are
presented
with
a
biography
almost
as
shadowy
and
elusive
as
that
of
shakespeare
in
many
ways
indeed
the
particulars
of
the
lives
of
these
two
which
we
possess
are
curiously
alike
both
were
voluminous
writers
both
enjoyed
considerable
contemporary
reputation
and
in
both
cases
our
knowledge
of
their
actual
history
is
confined
to
a
few
statements
by
persons
who
lived
somewhat
later
than
themselves
and
a
few
formal
documents
and
entries
in
grimmelshausen
case
this
obscurity
is
increased
by
his
practice
of
publishing
under
assumed
names
in
the
score
of
romances
and
tracts
which
are
undoubtedly
his
work
we
find
only
two
to
which
his
real
name
is
attached
he
has
nine
other
pseudonyms
nearly
all
anagrams
of
the
words
christoffel
von
grimmelshausen
of
these
german
schleifheim
von
sulsfort
and
samuel
greifnsohn
vom
hirschfelt
are
the
best
known
the
latter
being
the
name
to
which
he
most
persistently
clung
and
under
which
simplicissimus
was
published
though
the
former
appears
on
the
as
that
of
the
editor
only
as
the
signature
to
a
kind
of
advertisement
at
the
end
do
we
find
the
initials
of
hans
jacob
christoffel
von
grimmelshausen
his
full
name
until
the
publication
of
a
collection
of
his
works
by
felsecker
at
nuremberg
in
the
true
authorship
of
most
of
them
remained
unknown
but
that
editor
by
his
allusions
in
the
preface
practically
identified
the
writer
as
the
schultheiss
of
renchen
near
strassburg
whom
he
seems
to
have
known
personally
the
reasons
for
anonymity
were
no
doubt
firstly
the
fact
that
simplicissimus
at
least
dealt
with
the
actions
of
men
yet
alive
and
secondly
with
regard
to
the
other
books
the
continual
references
to
details
of
the
author
own
life
and
opinions
his
dread
of
offending
a
contemporary
is
shown
by
his
disguising
of
the
name
of
andré
the
commandant
of
lippstadt
as
de
of
bk
chap
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
enter
into
a
discussion
of
the
authorities
from
whom
the
meagre
particulars
of
grimmelshausen
life
are
drawn
it
may
suffice
for
our
present
purpose
to
indicate
the
main
events
of
that
life
he
was
born
at
gelnhausen
near
hanau
about
probably
of
a
humble
family
at
the
age
of
ten
he
was
captured
by
hessian
that
is
be
it
remembered
troops
and
became
a
member
of
that
unseliger
tross
the
unholy
crew
of
horseboys
harlots
sutlers
and
who
followed
the
armies
on
both
sides
and
sometimes
outnumbered
them
three
to
one
in
the
last
year
of
the
war
the
whole
imperial
army
only
numbered
fighting
men
and
the
recognised
who
were
commanded
and
kept
in
order
by
officers
significantly
named
the
provosts
of
the
harlots
no
less
than
in
the
preface
to
one
of
his
works
called
the
satyrical
pilgrim
grimmelshausen
speaks
of
himself
as
having
been
a
musqueteer
at
the
age
of
ten
a
statement
which
is
obviously
to
be
taken
in
the
same
sense
in
which
simplicissimus
tells
us
bk
chap
how
he
served
the
crown
of
sweden
at
a
similar
age
as
a
soldier
and
drew
pay
for
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
grimmelshausen
probably
served
a
musqueteer
or
several
musqueteers
just
as
the
boy
in
henry
serves
ancient
pistol
and
his
comrades
from
another
book
the
everlasting
almanack
we
learn
that
he
was
a
soldier
under
the
imperialist
general
götz
lay
in
garrison
at
offenburg
the
free
city
alluded
to
in
book
chapter
and
also
for
a
long
time
in
the
famous
fortress
of
philippsburg
of
his
residence
in
which
he
tells
various
anecdotes
there
are
traces
both
in
simplicissimus
and
his
other
books
of
a
wide
and
unusual
acquaintance
with
many
lands
german
and
he
knows
both
westphalia
and
saxony
well
bohemia
also
and
certainly
switzerland
the
journey
to
russia
may
have
some
foundation
in
fact
though
the
statement
put
into
the
mouth
of
simplicissimus
that
he
has
himself
seen
the
fabulous
sheep
plant
bk
chap
growing
in
siberia
considerably
detracts
from
his
trustworthiness
here
but
when
he
left
the
army
and
whether
he
ever
attained
to
any
reputable
rank
therein
is
quite
uncertain
if
be
the
correct
date
of
his
birth
he
would
be
but
years
old
at
the
conclusion
of
peace
besides
his
military
expeditions
it
is
pretty
clear
from
his
works
that
he
had
visited
amsterdam
and
paris
and
knew
them
fairly
well
but
for
nineteen
years
we
have
no
further
trace
of
his
career
till
he
suddenly
appears
as
schultheiss
under
the
bishop
of
strassburg
of
renchen
now
in
the
grand
duchy
of
baden
a
town
of
which
he
deliberately
conceals
the
name
exactly
as
he
does
his
own
by
anagrams
calling
it
now
rheinec
now
cernheim
in
october
he
appears
as
holding
this
office
and
issuing
an
order
concerning
the
mills
of
the
town
which
is
still
in
existence
his
wife
was
katharina
henninger
and
entries
have
been
found
of
the
birth
of
two
children
a
daughter
and
a
son
in
and
a
curious
episode
in
the
first
part
of
the
enchanted
quoted
hereafter
seems
to
indicate
a
grave
family
disappointment
in
he
died
aged
only
but
having
reached
what
may
almost
be
called
a
ripe
age
for
the
battered
and
spent
soldier
of
the
thirty
years
war
the
entry
of
his
death
is
peculiarly
full
and
even
discursive
and
tells
how
though
he
had
again
entered
on
military
service
no
doubt
on
the
occasion
of
the
french
invasion
in
and
though
his
sons
and
daughters
were
living
in
places
widely
distant
from
each
other
they
were
all
present
at
his
death
in
which
he
was
fortified
by
the
rites
of
holy
church
a
final
touch
of
uncertainty
is
added
by
the
fact
that
we
do
not
even
know
whether
grimmelshausen
was
his
true
name
it
is
more
likely
to
be
that
of
some
small
estate
which
he
had
acquired
and
of
which
he
assumed
the
name
when
as
we
learn
he
was
raised
to
noble
rank
it
is
plain
even
from
this
brief
outline
of
his
life
that
grimmelshausen
was
emphatically
a
man
and
it
is
partly
to
this
fact
that
we
owe
the
originality
of
his
work
for
he
had
never
fallen
under
the
baleful
influence
of
the
pedantry
of
his
time
he
had
it
is
true
picked
up
a
deal
of
knowledge
which
he
is
willing
enough
to
set
before
us
to
the
verge
of
tediousness
but
his
learning
is
very
superficial
he
was
a
poor
latinist
and
it
is
likely
that
for
most
of
his
erudition
he
was
indebted
to
the
translations
which
were
particularly
plentiful
during
that
golden
period
of
material
prosperity
in
germany
which
preceded
the
terrible
war
it
is
clear
enough
that
everywhere
he
thought
more
of
the
content
than
of
the
literary
form
of
his
own
or
any
other
work
and
for
the
times
his
scientific
and
mathematical
knowledge
was
considerable
in
the
field
of
romance
he
knows
and
does
not
hesitate
to
borrow
from
boccaccio
bandello
simplicissimus
bk
chaps
and
the
cent
nouvelles
nouvelles
while
in
his
minor
works
he
shows
ample
acquaintance
with
old
german
legend
and
also
with
stories
like
that
of
king
arthur
of
england
lastly
we
find
him
commending
the
incomparable
arcadia
of
sir
philip
sidney
which
he
would
have
read
in
the
translation
of
martin
opitz
as
a
model
of
eloquence
but
corrupting
and
enervating
in
its
effect
upon
the
manly
virtues
simplicissimus
bk
chap
yet
his
own
earlier
works
are
themselves
in
the
tedious
unreal
and
stilted
style
of
the
romances
of
chivalry
the
chaste
joseph
dietrich
and
amelind
and
proximus
and
limpida
though
widely
different
in
subject
are
alike
in
this
and
show
no
sign
of
the
genius
which
created
simplicissimus
yet
for
the
work
the
joseph
its
author
cherished
an
unreasoning
affection
and
even
alludes
to
it
in
our
romance
as
the
work
of
the
hero
himself
bk
chap
but
it
is
no
discredit
to
grimmelshausen
originality
if
we
conjecture
that
the
translations
of
spanish
picaresque
novels
chiefly
by
the
untiring
aegidius
albertini
which
appeared
during
the
first
two
decades
of
the
seventeenth
century
gave
him
the
idea
they
gave
him
little
or
nothing
more
of
a
vagabond
hero
mateo
aleman
famous
guzman
de
alfarache
had
been
succeeded
by
two
miserably
poor
second
parts
by
different
authors
and
in
one
of
these
there
appears
a
tedious
episode
containing
the
submarine
adventures
of
the
hero
under
the
form
of
a
to
which
we
may
conceivably
owe
the
equally
tedious
story
of
simplicissimus
and
the
sylphs
of
the
mummelsee
at
the
end
of
the
original
book
bk
chap
is
an
unblushing
copy
of
a
passage
from
a
work
of
antonio
quevara
or
guevara
also
translated
by
albertini
that
grimmelshausen
died
a
romanist
is
pretty
clear
from
the
entry
of
his
death
quoted
above
nor
is
it
likely
that
a
protestant
could
have
held
the
office
of
schultheiss
under
the
bishop
of
strassburg
there
is
also
extant
a
curious
dialogue
ascribed
to
grimmelshausen
in
which
simplicissimus
arguments
against
changing
his
religion
are
combated
and
finally
overthrown
by
a
certain
bonarnicus
who
effects
his
complete
conversion
it
is
far
from
improbable
that
the
account
of
his
rescue
from
sinful
indifference
at
einsiedel
which
simplicissimus
gives
bk
chap
of
course
apart
from
the
miraculous
incident
of
the
attack
on
him
by
the
unclean
spirit
roughly
represents
the
experience
of
his
author
that
the
latter
had
been
brought
up
a
protestant
we
simply
assume
from
the
fact
that
simplicissimus
is
understood
to
have
been
so
the
first
indication
which
we
have
of
a
change
in
his
opinions
being
his
exclamation
of
jesus
maria
bk
chap
which
draws
upon
him
the
suspicions
of
the
pastor
at
lippstadt
but
papist
or
not
our
author
superstition
is
unmistakable
it
was
indeed
a
time
like
all
periods
of
intense
human
misery
in
which
men
it
might
almost
be
said
turned
in
despair
to
the
powers
of
hell
because
they
had
lost
all
faith
in
those
of
heaven
that
numbers
of
the
unhappy
wretches
who
suffered
in
their
thousands
for
witchcraft
during
the
first
period
of
the
war
actually
believed
themselves
in
direct
communication
with
the
devil
is
certain
the
bishop
of
würzburg
fortnightly
were
only
stopped
when
some
of
the
victims
denounced
the
prelate
himself
as
their
accomplice
apparently
believing
it
grimmelshausen
is
ready
to
believe
anything
his
description
of
the
witches
sabbath
is
that
of
a
scene
which
he
is
firmly
convinced
is
a
possible
one
and
he
stoutly
defends
by
a
multitude
of
preposterous
stories
the
reasonableness
of
such
conviction
simplicissimus
bk
chaps
but
among
soldiers
the
most
widely
spread
superstition
was
that
concerned
with
invulnerability
not
only
separate
individuals
but
whole
bodies
of
troops
were
supposed
to
be
frozen
or
proof
at
all
events
against
leaden
bullets
christian
of
brunswick
actually
employed
his
ducal
brother
workers
in
glass
to
make
balls
of
that
material
to
be
used
against
tilly
troops
who
were
credited
with
this
supernatural
property
and
when
the
small
fortress
of
rogäz
near
dessau
was
captured
by
mansfeld
in
the
assailants
were
forbidden
to
use
their
as
useless
the
members
of
the
garrison
being
wizards
all
were
clubbed
to
death
with
or
the
of
musquets
in
all
probability
this
superstition
arose
mainly
from
observation
of
the
very
small
penetrating
power
of
the
ammunition
of
the
time
oliver
bk
chap
is
merely
bruised
on
the
forehead
by
a
bullet
fired
a
few
paces
off
and

it
is
true
that

has
as
it
seems
been
rendered
by
the
wicked
old
provost

whose
skull
herzbruder
bk
chap
caused
his
own
servant
to
split
with
an
axe
at
wittstock
when
no
pistol
could
slay
him
but
the
peasant
in
book
chapter
can
not
be
killed
by
a
bullet
fired
close
to
his
head
perhaps
by
reason
of
the
thickness
of
his
skull
to
celebrated
persons
particularly
the
reputation
of
being
gefroren
attached
count
adam

confidant
was
supposed
to
be
so
protected
the
superstition
regarding
claverhouse
who
could
only
be
killed
with
a
silver
bullet
is
well
known
and
even
as
late
as
there
was
a
belief
among
his
soldiers
that
frederick
william
ii
of
prussia
was
invulnerable

of
whom
more
hereafter
is
supposed
to
be
and
towards
the
end
of
the
war
passau
tickets
or
amulets
protecting
against
wounds
were
manufactured
and
sold
while
a
host
of
minor
magic
arts
more
or
less
connected
with
invulnerability
were
believed
to
exist
for
such
tricks
the
passage
from
the
generally
uninteresting
continuatio
which
is
given
as
appendix
b
of
this
book
is
a
kind
of
locus
classicus
another
whole
cycle
of
superstitions
centres
round
the
belief
in
possible
invisibility
of
persons
of
this
we
have
no
example
in
simplicissimus
though
the
whole
plot
of
the
delightful
double
romance
of
the
enchanted
also
fully
discussed
hereafter
depends
on
it
on
the
other
hand
the
story
of
the
production
of
the
puppies
from
the
pockets
of
the
colonel
guests
by
the
wizard
provost
in
book
chap
is
narrated
by
a
man
who
plainly
believed
such
things
possible
and
absolute
credence
is
given
to
the
powers
of
prophecy
possessed
both
by
old
herzbruder
bk
chaps
and
by
the
of
soest
bk
chap
who
is
apparently
a
character
of
the
times
it
is
noteworthy
that
herzbruder
thinks
meanly
of
the
art
of
palmistry
coming
to
the
actual
career
of
simplicissimus
as
chronicled
in
the
romance
which
bears
his
name
we
are
at
the
outset
confronted
by
some
strange
chronology
the
boy
is
born
just
after
the
battle
of
höchst
in
and
is
captured
by
the
troopers
when
ten
years
old
he
is
with
the
hermit
two
years
bk
chap
till
the
latter
death
and
makes
his
first
spring
into
the
world
after
the
battle
of
nördlingen
in
the
autumn
of
he
is
in
hanau
during
ramsay
rule
and
spends
there
the
winter
of
in
the
spring
of
there
was
still
ice
on
the
he
was
captured
by
croats
the
following
eighteen
months
are
occupied
by
his
adventures
as
a
and
as
a
and
the
next
certain
note
of
time
we
have
is
that
of
the
battle
of
wittstock
september
there
follow
the
happenings
at
soest
and
the
six
months
internment
at
lippstadt
but
at
the
time
of
the
siege
of
breisach
in
the
winter
of
he
has
long
been
back
from
paris
his
marriage
therefore
must
have
taken
place
before
the
completion
of
his
sixteenth
year
strange
as
this
may
appear
the
story
appears
to
be
deliberately
so
arranged
for
it
will
be
observed
that
just
before
the
lad
capture
by
the
swedes
it
is
plainly
implied
bk
chap
that
he
has
not
yet
arrived
at
the
age
of
puberty
grimmelshausen
intends
him
to
be
a
wunderkind
a
youthful
prodigy
and
such
an
explanation
is
far
more
likely
than
that
the
author
is
simply
careless
and
counting
on
the
carelessness
of
his
readers
to
conceal
the
incongruity
for
the
continual
references
to
the
time
of
year
at
which
various
events
happen
seem
to
prove
that
he
had
sketched
for
himself
something
like
a
chronology
of
his
fictitious
hero
life
and
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
ever
to
detect
him
in
the
smallest
false
note
of
time
the
date
of
the
banquet
and
dance
at
hanau
is
exactly
fixed
by
the
capture
of
braunfels
in
january
bk
chap
and
orb
and
staden
both
been
captured
before
simplicissimus
could
well
have
delivered
his
oration
on
the
miseries
of
a
governor
bk
chap
these
may
seem
small
matters
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
grimmelshausen
had
no
dictionary
of
dates
before
him
the
battle
of
jankow
in
gives
us
the
last
exact
date
to
be
found
in
the
book
and
tittmann
is
probably
right
in
assuming
that
with
that
engagement
the
author
personal
connection
with
the
war
ceased
by
the
time
simplicissimus
returns
from
his
eastern
wanderings
the
german
peace
had
been
concluded
at
the
very
beginning
of
simplicissimus
story
he
is
brought
in
contact
with
at
least
one
historical
personage
james
ramsay
the
swedish
commandant
of
hanau
whose
heroic
defence
of
that
town
is
well
known
simplicissimus
is
said
to
be
the
son
of
his
one
captain
sternfels
von
fuchsheim
this
man
christian
name
is
nowhere
given
the
boy
is
expressly
said
by
his
bk
chap
to
have
been
christened
melchior
after
himself
and
the
fictitious
character
of
the
supposed
parentage
seems
amply
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
whole
name
melchior
sternfels
von
fugshaim
as
it
is
often
spelt
is
an
exact
anagram
of
christoffel
von
grimmelshausen
we
may
therefore
pass
over
as
unmeaning
the
attribution
to
this
supposed
father
of
estates
in
scotland
by
the
pastor
in
book
chapter
and
must
probably
consign
to
the
realms
of
imagination
the
susanna
ramsay
also
that
grimmelshausen
was
really
brought
in
contact
possibly
as
a
page
with
the
commandant
of
hanau
seems
likely
he
knows
a
good
deal
of
him
but
of
his
later
career
he
is
quite
ignorant
he
even
repeats
as
true
the
malignant
calumny
circulated
by
the
jesuits
of
vienna
to
the
effect
that
ramsay
had
gone
mad
with
rage
at
the
loss
of
hanau
bk
chap
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
poor
man
died
partly
of
his
wounds
and
partly
of
a
broken
heart
the
only
other
historic
personage
in
the
story
who
can
be
identified
with
certainty
is
daniel
andré
a
hessian
soldier
of
fortune
bk
chap
of
dutch
descent
and
commanding
at
lippstadt
for
the
crown
of
sweden
for
what
reason
grimmelshausen
wrote
the
continuatio
a
dull
medley
of
allegories
visions
and
stories
of
knavery
brightened
only
by
the
robinsonade
at
the
end
it
is
hard
to
say
probably
at
the
urgent
request
of
his
publisher
when
the
striking
success
of
the
original
work
became
assured
it
appeared
at
möpelgard
montéliard
in
the
very
same
year
viz
as
the
first
known
edition
or
more
probably
editions
of
the
first
five
books
and
is
sometimes
quoted
as
a
sixth
book
two
years
later
there
were
issued
three
more
continuations
even
more
unworthy
of
their
author
and
laying
stress
chiefly
on
the
least
estimable
side
of
the
hero
character
the
roguery
by
which
he
paid
his
way
on
his
journey
back
from

the
worthlessness
of
these
sequels
is
the
more
remarkable
when

consider
the

of

it
is
a

which
makes
its

invisible
also
the

seizes
it
and
at
once
disappears
with
all

when

goes
into

slips
a
handful

first
part
of
the
history
of

the
young

is
an
honest
lad
who
uses
his
powers
for
good
only
and
his
experiences
are
of
exceeding
interest

in
their
most
intimate
particularities
by

circumstantially
described

likewise

castle
the
halberdier
prevents
hideous
and
unspeakable

by
a
device
similar
to

upon

and
rescues
the
intended
victims
of

the
adventures
follow
one
upon
another
in
quick
succession
but
are
ended
by
a
somewhat
unnecessary
fit
of
remorse
during
which
the
halberdier
tears
up
the
nest
it
is
however
found
and
the
portion
which
contains
its
magic
properties
kept
by
a
this
first
part
ends
with
a
fresh
appearance
of
simplicissimus
who
is
in
deep
grief
over
the
rejection
by
a
neighbouring
nobleman
of
his
application
for
a
post
for
his
son
whom
the
invisible
halberdier
has
seen
and
helped
out
of
trouble
in
the
convent
where
he
was
studying
this
scene
is
so
utterly
unconnected
with
the
course
of
the
narrative
that
it
is
conjectured
to
refer
to
some
real
family
misfortune
of
grimmelshausen
of
which
he
is
anxious
to
give
an
explanation
to
the
public
the
new
owner
of
the
enchanted
nest
is
the
merchant
whom
springinsfeld
wife
had
robbed
at
munich
and
the
second
part
is
occupied
with
the
story
of
his
wicked
misuse
of
his
powers
his
actions
are
the
very
opposite
of
the
halberdier
though
the
contrast
is
not
so
pointed
as
to
become
inartistic
he
makes
use
of
his
supernatural
facilities
to
seduce
his
own
servant
to
perpetrate
a
peculiarly
filthy
act
of
revenge
upon
his
faithless
wife
and
finally
to
accomplish
the
crowning
deception
of
his
whole
career
he
makes
his
way
into
the
family
of
a
respectable
portuguese
jew
in
the
first
instance
with
a
view
to
robbery
but
becoming
enamoured
of
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
house
he
employs
his
invisibility
to
practise
a
most
blasphemous
piece
of
knavery
he
succeeds
in
making
the
unfortunate
parents
believe
that
the
maiden
is
destined
to
be
the
mother
of
the
future
messiah
by
the
prophet
elias
the
latter
part
he
of
course
plays
himself
and
enjoys
the
society
of
his
victim
till
at
length
a
child
is
born
which
turns
out
to
the
general
horror
to
be
a
girl
the
motive
is
not
new
and
the
story
is
a
sordid
one
but
it
is
most
artistically
recounted
and
an
intimate
knowledge
of
jewish
manners
and
ideas
is
displayed
the
narrative
is
also
diversified
by
an
element
found
in
none
of
the
other
romances
of
the
cycle
acute
and
farsighted
political
discourses
and
reasonings
on
european
affairs
as
likely
to
be
affected
by
the
war
then
impending
with
france
which
ended
with
the
treaty
of
nimwegen
in
rendered
desperate
by
his
sins
though
now
deeply
enamoured
of
the
unfortunate
jewess
esther
the
merchant
is
on
the
verge
of
surrendering
himself
to
the
power
of
black
magicians
of
the
worst
and
most
diabolical
kind
when
he
escapes
by
betaking
himself
to
the
wars
possessing
besides
his
invisibility
the
power
of
rendering
himself
invulnerable
he
is
nevertheless
wounded
by
a
consecrated
bullet
and
finally
makes
his
way
home
in
poverty
and
misery
accompanied
by
a
pious
monk
the
nest
is
thrown
into
the
rhine
and
disappears
for
ever
and
the
merchant
prepares
to
spend
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
prayer
and
penitence
the
connection
of
the

with
simplicissimus
is
nominal
only
it
appeared
in

is
a

specimen
of

be
called
the

not
without
interest
from
the
sociological
point
of
view
the
book
reminds
us
of
simplicissimus
only
by
its
connection
with
that
side
of
his
character
which
we
would
willingly
forget
but
for
which
grimmelshausen
seems
to
have
cherished
an
unreasoning
admiration
and
on
which
he
insisted
more
and
more
in
his
successive
works
namely
his
qualities
as
a
quack
and
mountebank
as
already
pointed
out
the
interest
of
the
central
romance
of
simplicissimus
is
less
literary
than
historic
whereas
german
critics
in
their
estimate
of
its
value
have
considered
the
first
aspect
only
and
their
opinions
are
consequently
little
worth
recording
gervinus
for
example
looking
at
the
book
from
a
purely
artistic
point
of
view
finds
it
wanting
other
critics
have
followed
him
blindly
and
with
a
considerable
amount
of
underlying
ignorance
to
boot
the
accurate
dahlmann
for
example
though
he
reckons
the
romance
among
his
historical
sources
speaks
of
it
as
published
at
möpelgard
in
in
six
volumes
plainly
he
had
never
seen
a
copy
but
had
heard
of
the
six
books
five
and
the
continuation
and
mistook
them
for
volumes
tittmann
one
of
the
latest
editors
of
the
work
sums
up
its
chief
merits
when
he
says
simplicissimus
and
the
simplician
writings
are
almost
our
only
substitute
and
that
a
poor
one
for
the
contemporary
memoirs
in
which
our
western
neighbours
are
so
rich
the
bibliography
of
the
book
is
for
our
purpose
not
important
for
a
year
or
two
editions
seem
to
have
succeeded
each
other
with
such
rapidity
that
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
between
them
but
the
only
additional
value
which
those
printed
later
than
possess
is
the
questionable
one
of
including
the
three
worthless
little
sequels
above
referred
to
of
modern
editions
the
best
perhaps
is
that
of
tittmann
leipzig
which
has
been
principally
used
for
this
translation
the
annotations
however
leave
much
to
be
desired
many
difficulties
are
left
unexplained
and
there
are
some
positive
mistakes
of
which
a
single
instance
may
suffice
in
book
chapter
we
find
the
expression
in
prima
plana
which
is
a
sufficiently
military
phrase
of
the
time
and
means
on
the
first
page
of
the
which
contained
the
names
of
the
officers
of
a
company
written
separately
from
those
of
the
rank
and
file
it
is
explained
by
tittmann
to
mean
at
the
first
estimate
and
succeeding
editors
have
copied
this
adding
as
a
possible
alternative
in
the
first
engagement
or
at
the
first
start
the
editions
for
school
and
family
reading
which
are
current
in
germany
are
as
a
rule
so
expurgated
as
to
deprive
the
book
of
much
of
its
interest
in
this
translation
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
omit
a
single
episode
only
which
is
as
childishly
filthy
as
it
is
utterly
uninteresting
book
i
treats
of
simplicissimus
rustic
descent
and
of
his
upbringing
answering
thereto
there
appeareth
in
these
days
of
ours
of
which
many
do
believe
that
they
be
the
last
days
among
the
common
folk
a
certain
disease
which
causeth
those
who
do
suffer
from
it
so
soon
as
they
have
either
scraped
and
higgled
together
so
much
that
they
can
besides
a
few
pence
in
their
pocket
wear
a
fool
coat
of
the
new
fashion
with
a
thousand
bits
of
silk
ribbon
upon
it
or
by
some
trick
of
fortune
have
become
known
as
men
of
parts
forthwith
to
give
themselves
out
gentlemen
and
nobles
of
ancient
descent
whereas
it
doth
often
happen
that
their
ancestors
were
carters
and
porters
their
cousins
their
brothers
turnkeys
and
catchpolls
their
sisters
harlots
their
mothers
bawds
yea
witches
even
and
in
a
word
their
whole
pedigree
of
quarterings
as
full
of
dirt
and
stain
as
ever
was
the
guild
of
prague
yea
these
new
sprigs
of
nobility
be
often
themselves
as
black
as
if
they
had
been
born
and
bred
in
guinea
with
such
foolish
folk
i
desire
not
to
even
myself
though
is
not
untrue
that
i
have
often
fancied
i
must
have
drawn
my
birth
from
some
great
lord
or
knight
at
least
as
being
by
nature
disposed
to
follow
the
nobleman
trade
had
i
but
the
means
and
the
tools
for
it
is
true
moreover
without
jesting
that
my
birth
and
upbringing
can
be
well
compared
to
that
of
a
prince
if
we
overlook
the
one
great
difference
in
degree
how
did
not
my
dad
for
so
they
call
fathers
in
the
spessart
have
his
own
palace
like
any
other
so
fine
as
no
king
could
build
with
his
own
hands
but
must
let
that
alone
for
ever
was
painted
with
lime
and
in
place
of
unfruitful
tiles
cold
lead
and
red
copper
was
roofed
with
that
straw
whereupon
the
noble
corn
doth
grow
and
that
he
my
dad
might
make
a
proper
show
of
nobility
and
riches
he
had
his
wall
round
his
castle
built
not
of
stone
which
men
do
find
upon
the
road
or
dig
out
of
the
earth
in
barren
places
much
less
of
miserable
baked
bricks
that
in
a
brief
space
can
be
made
and
burned
as
other
great
lords
be
wont
to
do
but
he
did
use
oak
which
noble
and
profitable
tree
being
such
that
smoked
sausage
and
fat
ham
doth
grow
upon
it
taketh
for
its
full
growth
no
less
than
a
hundred
years
and
where
is
the
monarch
that
can
imitate
him
therein
his
halls
his
rooms
and
his
chambers
did
he
have
thoroughly
blackened
with
smoke
and
for
this
reason
only
that
is
the
most
lasting
colour
in
the
world
and
doth
take
longer
to
reach
to
real
perfection
than
an
artist
will
spend
on
his
most
excellent
paintings
the
tapestries
were
of
the
most
delicate
web
in
the
world
wove
for
us
by
her
that
of
old
did
challenge
minerva
to
a
spinning
match
his
windows
were
dedicated
to
papyrius
for
no
other
reason
than
that
that
same
paper
doth
take
longer
to
come
to
perfection
reckoning
from
the
sowing
of
the
hemp
or
flax
whereof
is
made
than
doth
the
finest
and
clearest
glass
of
murano
for
his
trade
made
him
apt
to
believe
that
whatever
was
produced
with
much
pains
was
also
more
valuable
and
more
costly
and
what
was
most
costly
was
best
suited
to
nobility
instead
of
pages
lackeys
and
grooms
he
had
sheep
goats
and
swine
which
often
waited
upon
me
in
the
pastures
till
i
drove
them
home
his
armoury
was
well
furnished
with
ploughs
mattocks
axes
hoes
shovels
pitchforks
and
hayforks
with
which
weapons
he
daily
exercised
himself
for
hoeing
and
digging
he
made
his
military
discipline
as
did
the
old
romans
in
time
of
peace
the
yoking
of
oxen
was
his
generalship
the
piling
of
dung
his
fortification
tilling
of
the
land
his
campaigning
and
the
cleaning
out
of
stables
his
princely
pastime
and
exercise
by
this
means
did
he
conquer
the
whole
round
world
so
far
as
he
could
reach
and
at
every
harvest
did
draw
from
it
rich
spoils
but
all
this
i
account
nothing
of
and
am
not
puffed
up
thereby
lest
any
should
have
cause
to
jibe
at
me
as
at
other
newfangled
nobility
for
i
esteem
myself
no
higher
than
was
my
dad
which
had
his
abode
in
a
right
merry
land
to
wit
in
the
spessart
where
the
wolves
do
howl
goodnight
to
each
other
but
that
i
have
as
yet
told
you
nought
of
my
dad
family
race
and
name
is
for
the
sake
of
precious
brevity
especially
since
there
is
here
no
question
of
a
foundation
for
gentlefolks
for
me
to
swear
myself
into
is
enough
if
it
be
known
that
i
was
born
in
the
spessart
now
as
my
dad
manner
of
living
will
be
perceived
to
be
truly
noble
so
any
man
of
sense
will
easily
understand
that
my
upbringing
was
like
and
suitable
thereto
and
whoso
thinks
that
is
not
deceived
for
in
my
tenth
year
had
i
already
learned
the
rudiments
of
my
dad
princely
exercises
yet
as
touching
studies
i
might
compare
with
the
famous
amphistides
of
whom
suidas
reports
that
he
could
not
count
higher
than
five
for
my
dad
had
perchance
too
high
a
spirit
and
therefore
followed
the
use
of
these
days
wherein
many
persons
of
quality
trouble
themselves
not
as
they
say
with
bookworms
follies
but
have
their
hirelings
to
do
their
for
them
yet
was
i
a
fine
performer
on
the
bagpipe
whereon
i
could
produce
most
dolorous
strains
but
as
to
knowledge
of
things
divine
none
shall
ever
persuade
me
that
any
lad
of
my
age
in
all
christendom
could
there
beat
me
for
i
knew
nought
of
god
or
man
of
heaven
or
hell
of
angel
or
devil
nor
could
discern
between
good
and
evil
so
may
it
be
easily
understood
that
i
with
such
knowledge
of
theology
lived
like
our
first
parents
in
paradise
which
in
their
innocence
knew
nought
of
sickness
or
death
or
dying
and
still
less
of
the
resurrection
o
noble
life
or
as
one
might
better
say
o
noodle
life
in
which
none
troubles
himself
about
medicine
and
by
this
measure
ye
can
estimate
my
proficiency
in
the
study
of
jurisprudence
and
all
other
arts
and
sciences
yea
i
was
so
perfected
in
ignorance
that
i
knew
not
that
i
knew
nothing
so
say
i
again
o
noble
life
that
once
i
led
but
my
dad
would
not
suffer
me
long
to
enjoy
such
bliss
but
deemed
it
right
that
as
being
nobly
born
i
should
nobly
act
and
nobly
live
and
therefore
began
to
train
me
up
for
higher
things
and
gave
me
harder
lessons
of
the
first
step
towards
that
dignity
to
which
simplicissimus
attained
to
which
is
added
the
praise
of
shepherds
and
other
excellent
precepts
for
he
invested
me
with
the
highest
dignity
that
could
be
found
not
only
in
his
household
but
in
the
whole
world
namely
with
the
office
of
a
shepherd
for
first
he
did
entrust
me
with
his
swine
then
his
goats
and
then
his
whole
flock
of
sheep
that
i
should
keep
and
feed
the
same
and
by
means
of
my
bagpipe
of
which
strabo
writeth
that
in
arabia
its
music
alone
doth
fatten
the
sheep
and
lambs
protect
them
from
the
wolf
then
was
i
like
to
david
save
that
he
in
place
of
the
bagpipe
had
but
a
harp
which
was
no
bad
beginning
for
me
but
a
good
omen
that
in
time
if
i
had
any
manner
of
luck
i
should
become
a
famous
man
for
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
high
personages
have
been
shepherds
as
we
read
in
holy
writ
of
abel
abraham
isaac
jacob
and
his
sons
yea
of
moses
also
which
must
first
keep
his
his
sheep
before
he
was
made
and
ruler
over
six
hundred
thousand
men
in
israel
and
now
may
some
man
say
these
were
holy
and
godly
men
and
no
spessart
knowing
nought
of
god
which
i
must
confess
yet
why
should
my
then
innocence
be
laid
to
my
charge
yet
among
the
heathen
of
old
time
you
will
find
examples
as
many
as
among
god
chosen
folk
so
among
the
romans
were
noble
families
that
without
doubt
were
called
bubulci
vituli
vitellii
caprae
and
so
forth
because
they
had
to
do
with
the
cattle
so
named
and
is
like
had
even
herded
them
is
certain
romulus
and
remus
were
shepherds
and
spartacus
that
made
the
whole
roman
world
to
tremble
what
was
not
paris
king
priam
son
a
shepherd
and
anchises
the
trojan
prince
aeneas
father
the
beautiful
endymion
of
whom
the
chaste
luna
was
enamoured
was
a
shepherd
and
so
too
the
grisly
polypheme
yea
the
gods
themselves
were
not
ashamed
of
this
trade
apollo
kept
the
kine
of
admetus
king
of
thessaly
mercurius
and
his
son
daphnis
pan
and
proteus
were
all
mighty
shepherds
and
therefore
be
they
still
called
by
our
fantastic
poets
the
patrons
of
herdsmen
mesha
king
of
moab
as
we
do
read
in
ii
kings
was
a
cyrus
the
great
king
of
persia
was
not
only
reared
by
mithridates
a
shepherd
but
himself
did
keep
sheep
gyges
was
first
a
herdsman
and
then
by
the
power
of
a
ring
became
a
king
and
ismael
sophi
a
persian
king
did
in
his
youth
likewise
herd
cattle
so
that
philo
the
jew
doth
excellently
deal
with
the
matter
in
his
life
of
moses
when
he
saith
the
shepherd
trade
is
a
preparation
and
a
beginning
for
the
ruling
of
men
for
as
men
are
trained
and
exercised
for
the
wars
in
hunting
so
should
they
that
are
intended
for
government
first
be
reared
in
the
gentle
and
kindly
duty
of
a
shepherd
all
which
my
dad
doubtless
did
understand
yea
to
know
it
doth
to
this
hour
give
me
no
little
hope
of
my
future
greatness
but
to
come
back
to
my
flock
ye
must
know
that
i
knew
as
little
of
wolves
as
of
mine
own
ignorance
and
therefore
was
my
dad
the
more
diligent
with
his
lessons
and
lad
says
he
have
a
care
let
not
the
sheep
run
far
from
each
other
and
play
thy
bagpipe
manfully
lest
the
wolf
come
and
do
harm
for
is
a
knave
and
a
thief
that
eateth
man
and
beast
and
if
thou
beest
anyways
negligent
he
will
dust
thy
jacket
for
thee
to
which
i
answered
with
like
courtesy
daddy
tell
me
how
a
wolf
looks
for
such
i
never
saw
yet
o
thou
silly
blockhead
quoth
he
all
thy
life
long
wilt
thou
be
a
fool
thou
art
already
a
great
looby
and
yet
knowest
not
what
a
rogue
a
wolf
is
and
more
lessons
did
he
give
me
and
at
last
grew
angry
and
went
away
as
bethinking
him
that
my
thick
wit
could
not
comprehend
his
nice
instruction
treats
of
the
sufferings
of
a
faithful
bagpipe
so
i
began
to
make
such
ado
with
my
bagpipe
and
such
noise
that
was
enough
to
poison
all
the
toads
in
the
garden
and
so
methought
i
was
safe
enough
from
the
wolf
that
was
ever
in
my
mind
and
remembering
me
of
my
mammy
for
so
they
do
use
to
call
their
mothers
in
the
spessart
and
the
vogelsberg
how
she
had
often
said
the
fowls
would
some
time
or
other
die
of
my
singing
i
fell
upon
the
thought
to
sing
the
more
and
so
make
my
defence
against
the
wolf
stronger
and
so
i
sang
this
which
i
had
learned
from
my
mammy
o
peasant
race
so
much
despised
how
greatly
art
thou
to
be
priz
yea
none
thy
praises
can
excel
if
men
would
only
mark
thee
well
how
would
it
with
the
world
now
stand
had
adam
never
till
the
land
with
spade
and
hoe
he
dug
the
earth
from
whom
our
princes
have
their
birth
whatever
earth
doth
bear
this
day
is
under
thine
high
rule
and
sway
and
all
that
fruitful
makes
the
land
is
guided
by
thy
master
hand
the
emperor
whom
god
doth
give
us
to
protect
thereby
doth
live
so
doth
the
soldier
though
his
trade
to
thy
great
loss
and
harm
be
made
meat
for
our
feasts
thou
dost
provide
our
wine
by
thee
too
is
supplied
thy
plough
can
force
the
earth
to
give
that
bread
whereby
all
men
must
live
all
waste
the
earth
and
desert
were
didst
thou
not
ply
thy
calling
there
sad
day
shall
that
for
all
be
found
when
peasants
cease
to
till
the
ground
so
hast
thou
right
to
laud
and
praise
for
thou
dost
feed
us
all
our
days
nature
herself
thee
well
doth
love
and
god
thy
handiwork
approve
whoever
yet
on
earth
did
hear
of
peasant
that
the
gout
did
fear
that
fell
disease
which
rich
men
dread
whereby
is
many
a
noble
dead
from
all
vainglory
art
thou
free
as
in
these
days
thou
well
mayst
be
and
lest
thou
shouldst
through
pride
have
loss
god
bids
thee
daily
bear
thy
cross
yea
even
the
soldier
wicked
will
may
work
thee
great
advantage
still
for
lest
thou
shouldst
to
pride
incline
thy
goods
and
house
saith
he
are
mine
so
far
and
no
further
could
i
get
with
my
song
for
in
a
moment
was
i
surrounded
sheep
and
all
by
a
troop
of
cuirassiers
that
had
lost
their
way
in
the
thick
wood
and
were
brought
back
to
their
right
path
by
my
music
and
my
calls
to
my
flock
aha
quoth
i
to
myself
these
be
the
right
rogues
these
be
the
knaves
and
thieves
whereof
thy
dad
did
tell
thee
for
at
first
i
took
horse
and
man
as
did
the
americans
the
spanish
cavalry
to
be
but
one
beast
and
could
not
but
conceive
these
were
the
wolves
and
so
would
sound
the
retreat
for
these
horrible
centaurs
and
send
them
but
scarce
had
i
blown
up
my
bellows
to
that
end
when
one
of
them
catches
me
by
the
shoulder
and
swings
me
up
so
roughly
upon
a
spare
farm
horse
they
had
stolen
with
other
booty
that
i
must
needs
fall
on
the
other
side
and
that
too
upon
my
dear
bagpipe
which
began
so
miserably
to
scream
as
it
would
move
all
the
world
to
pity
which
availed
nought
though
it
spared
not
its
last
breath
in
the
bewailing
of
my
sad
fate
to
horse
again
i
must
go
it
mattered
not
what
my
bagpipe
did
sing
or
say
yet
what
vexed
me
most
was
that
the
troopers
said
i
had
hurt
my
dear
bagpipe
and
therefore
it
had
made
so
heathenish
an
outcry
so
away
my
horse
went
with
me
at
a
good
trot
like
the
primum
mobile
for
my
dad
farm
now
did
strange
and
fantastic
imaginings
fill
my
brain
for
i
did
conceive
because
i
sat
upon
such
a
beast
as
i
had
never
before
seen
that
i
too
should
be
changed
into
an
iron
man
and
because
such
a
change
came
not
there
arose
in
me
other
foolish
fantasies
for
i
thought
these
strange
creatures
were
but
there
to
help
me
drive
my
sheep
home
for
none
strayed
from
the
path
but
all
with
one
accord
made
for
my
dad
farm
so
i
looked
anxiously
when
my
dad
and
my
mammy
should
come
out
to
bid
us
welcome
which
yet
came
not
for
they
and
our
ursula
which
was
my
dad
only
daughter
had
found
the
open
and
would
not
wait
for
their
guests
how
simplicissimus
palace
was
stormed
plundered
and
ruinated
and
in
what
sorry
fashion
the
soldiers
kept
house
there
although
it
was
not
my
intention
to
take
the
reader
with
these
troopers
to
my
dad
house
and
farm
seeing
that
matters
will
go
ill
therein
yet
the
course
of
my
history
demands
that
i
should
leave
to
kind
posterity
an
account
of
what
manner
of
cruelties
were
now
and
again
practised
in
this
our
german
war
yea
and
moreover
testify
by
my
own
example
that
such
evils
must
often
have
been
sent
to
us
by
the
goodness
of
almighty
god
for
our
profit
for
gentle
reader
who
would
ever
have
taught
me
that
there
was
a
god
in
heaven
if
these
soldiers
had
not
destroyed
my
dad
house
and
by
such
a
deed
driven
me
out
among
folk
who
gave
me
all
fitting
instruction
thereupon
only
a
little
while
before
i
neither
knew
nor
could
fancy
to
myself
that
there
were
any
people
on
earth
save
only
my
dad
my
mother
and
me
and
the
rest
of
our
household
nor
did
i
know
of
any
human
habitation
but
that
where
i
daily
went
out
and
in
but
soon
thereafter
i
understood
the
way
of
men
coming
into
this
world
and
how
they
must
leave
it
again
i
was
only
in
shape
a
man
and
in
name
a
christian
for
the
rest
i
was
but
a
beast
yet
the
almighty
looked
upon
my
innocence
with
a
pitiful
eye
and
would
bring
me
to
a
knowledge
both
of
himself
and
of
myself
and
although
he
had
a
thousand
ways
to
lead
me
thereto
yet
would
he
doubtless
use
that
one
only
by
which
my
dad
and
my
mother
should
be
punished
and
that
for
an
example
to
all
others
by
reason
of
their
heathenish
upbringing
of
me
the
first
thing
these
troopers
did
was
that
they
stabled
their
horses
thereafter
each
fell
to
his
appointed
task
which
task
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
ruin
and
destruction
for
though
some
began
to
slaughter
and
to
boil
and
to
roast
so
that
it
looked
as
if
there
should
be
a
merry
banquet
forward
yet
others
there
were
who
did
but
storm
through
the
house
above
and
below
stairs
others
stowed
together
great
parcels
of
cloth
and
apparel
and
all
manner
of
household
stuff
as
if
they
would
set
up
a
frippery
market
all
that
they
had
no
mind
to
take
with
them
they
cut
in
pieces
some
thrust
their
swords
through
the
hay
and
straw
as
if
they
had
not
enough
sheep
and
swine
to
slaughter
and
some
shook
the
feathers
out
of
the
beds
and
in
their
stead
stuffed
in
bacon
and
other
dried
meat
and
provisions
as
if
such
were
better
and
softer
to
sleep
upon
others
broke
the
stove
and
the
windows
as
if
they
had
a
summer
to
promise
houseware
of
copper
and
tin
they
beat
flat
and
packed
such
vessels
all
bent
and
spoiled
in
with
the
rest
bedsteads
tables
chairs
and
benches
they
burned
though
there
lay
many
cords
of
dry
wood
in
the
yard
pots
and
pipkins
must
all
go
to
pieces
either
because
they
would
eat
none
but
roast
flesh
or
because
their
purpose
was
to
make
there
but
a
single
meal
our
maid
was
so
handled
in
the
stable
that
she
could
not
come
out
which
is
a
shame
to
tell
of
our
man
they
laid
bound
upon
the
ground
thrust
a
gag
into
his
mouth
and
poured
a
pailful
of
filthy
water
into
his
body
and
by
this
which
they
called
a
swedish
draught
they
forced
him
to
lead
a
party
of
them
to
another
place
where
they
captured
men
and
beasts
and
brought
them
back
to
our
farm
in
which
company
were
my
dad
my
mother
and
our
ursula
and
now
they
began
first
to
take
the
flints
out
of
their
pistols
and
in
place
of
them
to
jam
the
peasants
thumbs
in
and
so
to
torture
the
poor
rogues
as
if
they
had
been
about
the
burning
of
witches
for
one
of
them
they
had
taken
they
thrust
into
the
baking
oven
and
there
lit
a
fire
under
him
although
he
had
as
yet
confessed
no
crime
as
for
another
they
put
a
cord
round
his
head
and
so
twisted
it
tight
with
a
piece
of
wood
that
the
blood
gushed
from
his
mouth
and
nose
and
ears
in
a
word
each
had
his
own
device
to
torture
the
peasants
and
each
peasant
his
several
torture
but
as
it
seemed
to
me
then
my
dad
was
the
luckiest
for
he
with
a
laughing
face
confessed
what
others
must
out
with
in
the
midst
of
pains
and
miserable
lamentations
and
such
honour
without
doubt
fell
to
him
because
he
was
the
householder
for
they
set
him
before
a
fire
and
bound
him
fast
so
that
he
could
neither
stir
hand
nor
foot
and
smeared
the
soles
of
his
feet
with
wet
salt
and
this
they
made
our
old
goat
lick
off
and
so
tickle
him
that
he
well
nigh
burst
his
sides
with
laughing
and
this
seemed
to
me
so
merry
a
thing
that
i
must
needs
laugh
with
him
for
the
sake
of
fellowship
or
because
i
knew
no
better
in
the
midst
of
such
laughter
he
must
needs
confess
all
that
they
would
have
of
him
and
indeed
revealed
to
them
a
secret
treasure
which
proved
far
richer
in
pearls
gold
and
trinkets
than
any
would
have
looked
for
among
peasants
of
the
women
girls
and
maidservants
whom
they
took
i
have
not
much
to
say
in
particular
for
the
soldiers
would
not
have
me
see
how
they
dealt
with
them
yet
this
i
know
that
one
heard
some
of
them
scream
most
piteously
in
divers
corners
of
the
house
and
well
i
can
judge
it
fared
no
better
with
my
mother
and
our
ursel
than
with
the
rest
yet
in
the
midst
of
all
this
miserable
ruin
i
helped
to
turn
the
spit
and
in
the
afternoon
to
give
the
horses
drink
in
which
employ
i
encountered
our
maid
in
the
stable
who
seemed
to
me
wondrously
tumbled
so
that
i
knew
her
not
but
with
a
weak
voice
she
called
to
me
o
lad
run
away
or
the
troopers
will
have
thee
away
with
them
look
to
it
well
that
thou
get
hence
thou
seest
in
what
plight
and
more
she
could
not
say
how
simplicissimus
took
french
leave
and
how
he
was
terrified
by
dead
trees
now
did
i
begin
to
consider
and
to
ponder
upon
my
unhappy
condition
and
prospects
and
to
think
how
i
might
best
help
myself
out
of
my
plight
for
whither
should
i
go
here
indeed
my
poor
wits
were
far
too
slender
to
devise
a
plan
yet
they
served
me
so
far
that
towards
evening
i
ran
into
the
woods
but
then
whither
was
i
to
go
further
for
the
ways
of
the
wood
were
as
little
known
to
me
as
the
passage
beyond
nova
zembla
through
the
arctic
ocean
to
china
is
true
the
night
was
my
protection
yet
to
my
dark
wits
it
seemed
not
dark
enough
so
i
did
hide
myself
in
a
close
thicket
wherein
i
could
hear
both
the
shrieks
of
the
tortured
peasants
and
the
song
of
the
nightingales
which
birds
regarded
not
the
peasants
either
to
show
compassion
for
them
or
to
stop
their
sweet
song
for
their
sakes
and
so
i
laid
myself
as
free
from
care
upon
one
ear
and
fell
asleep
but
when
the
morning
star
began
to
glimmer
in
the
east
i
could
see
my
poor
dad
house
all
aflame
yet
none
that
sought
to
stop
the
fire
so
i
betook
myself
thither
in
hopes
to
have
some
news
of
my
dad
whereupon
i
was
espied
by
five
troopers
of
whom
one
holloaed
to
me
come
hither
boy
or
i
will
shoot
thee
dead
but
i
stood
and
as
knowing
not
what
he
meant
or
would
have
and
i
standing
there
and
gaping
upon
them
like
a
cat
at
a
new
and
they
by
reason
of
a
morass
between
not
being
able
to
come
at
me
which
vexed
them
mightily
one
discharged
his
carbine
at
me
at
which
sudden
flame
of
fire
and
unexpected
noise
which
the
echo
repeating
it
many
times
made
more
dreadful
i
was
so
terrified
that
forthwith
i
fell
to
the
ground
and
for
terror
durst
not
move
a
finger
though
the
troopers
went
their
way
and
doubtless
left
me
for
dead
nor
for
that
whole
day
had
i
spirit
to
rise
up
but
night
again
overtaking
me
i
stood
up
and
wandered
away
into
the
woods
until
i
saw
afar
off
a
dead
tree
that
shone
and
this
again
wrought
in
me
a
new
fear
wherefore
i
turned
me
about
and
ran
till
i
saw
another
such
tree
from
which
i
hurried
away
again
and
in
this
manner
spent
the
night
running
from
one
dead
tree
to
another
at
last
came
blessed
daylight
to
my
help
and
bade
those
trees
leave
me
untroubled
in
its
presence
yet
was
i
not
much
the
better
thereby
for
my
heart
was
full
of
fear
and
dread
my
brain
of
foolish
fancies
and
my
legs
of
weariness
my
belly
of
hunger
and
mine
eyes
of
sleep
so
i
went
on
and
on
and
knew
not
whither
yet
the
further
i
went
the
thicker
grew
the
wood
and
the
greater
the
distance
from
all
human
kind
so
now
i
came
to
my
senses
and
perceived
yet
without
knowing
it
the
effect
of
ignorance
and
want
of
knowledge
for
if
an
unreasoning
beast
had
been
in
my
place
he
would
have
known
what
to
do
for
his
sustenance
better
than
i
yet
i
had
wit
enough
when
darkness
again
overtook
me
to
creep
into
a
hollow
tree
and
there
take
up
my
quarters
for
the
night
is
so
short
and
so
prayerful
that
simplicissimus
thereupon
swoons
away
but
hardly
had
i
composed
myself
to
sleep
when
i
heard
a
voice
that
cried
aloud
o
wondrous
love
towards
us
thankless
mortals
o
mine
only
comfort
my
hope
my
riches
my
god
and
more
of
the
same
sort
all
of
which
i
could
not
hear
or
understand
yet
these
were
surely
words
which
should
rightly
have
cheered
comforted
and
delighted
every
christian
soul
that
should
find
itself
in
such
a
plight
as
did
i
but
o
simplicity
o
ignorance
was
all
gibberish
to
me
and
all
in
an
unknown
tongue
out
of
which
i
could
make
nothing
yea
was
rather
terrified
by
its
strangeness
yet
when
i
heard
how
the
hunger
and
thirst
of
him
that
spake
should
be
satisfied
my
unbearable
hunger
did
counsel
me
to
join
myself
to
him
as
a
guest
so
i
plucked
up
heart
to
come
out
of
my
hollow
tree
and
to
draw
nigh
to
the
voice
i
had
heard
where
i
was
ware
of
a
tall
man
with
long
greyish
hair
which
fell
in
confusion
over
his
shoulders
a
tangled
beard
he
had
shapen
like
to
a
swiss
cheese
his
face
yellow
and
thin
yet
kindly
enough
and
his
long
gown
made
up
of
more
than
a
thousand
pieces
of
cloth
of
all
sorts
sewn
together
one
upon
another
round
his
neck
and
body
he
had
wound
a
heavy
iron
chain
like
william
and
in
other
ways
seemed
in
mine
eyes
so
grisly
and
terrible
that
i
began
to
shake
like
a
wet
dog
but
what
made
my
fear
greater
was
that
he
did
hug
to
his
breast
a
crucifix
some
six
spans
long
so
i
could
fancy
nought
else
but
that
this
old
grey
man
must
be
the
wolf
of
whom
my
dad
had
of
late
told
me
and
in
my
fear
i
whipped
out
my
bagpipe
which
as
mine
only
treasure
i
had
saved
from
the
troopers
and
blowing
up
the
sack
tuned
up
and
made
a
mighty
noise
to
drive
away
that
same
grisly
wolf
at
which
sudden
and
unaccustomed
music
in
that
lonely
place
the
hermit
was
at
first
no
little
dismayed
deeming
without
doubt
was
a
devil
come
to
terrify
him
and
so
disturb
his
prayers
as
happened
to
the
great
anthony
but
presently
recovering
himself
he
mocked
at
me
as
his
tempter
in
the
hollow
tree
whither
i
had
retired
myself
nay
plucked
up
such
heart
that
he
advanced
upon
me
to
defy
the
enemy
of
mankind
aha
says
he
thou
art
a
proper
fellow
enough
to
tempt
saints
without
god
leave
and
more
than
that
i
heard
not
for
his
approach
caused
in
me
such
fear
and
trembling
that
i
lost
my
senses
and
fell
forthwith
into
a
swoon
how
simplicissimus
was
in
a
poor
lodging
kindly
entreated
after
what
manner
i
was
helped
to
myself
again
i
know
not
only
this
that
the
old
man
had
my
head
on
his
breast
and
my
jacket
open
in
front
when
i
came
to
my
senses
but
when
i
saw
the
hermit
so
close
to
me
i
raised
such
a
hideous
outcry
as
if
he
would
have
torn
the
heart
out
of
my
body
then
said
he
my
son
hold
thy
peace
be
content
i
do
thee
no
harm
yet
the
more
he
comforted
me
and
soothed
me
the
more
i
cried
oh
thou
eatest
me
oh
thou
eatest
me
thou
art
the
wolf
and
wilt
eat
me
nay
nay
said
he
my
son
be
at
peace
i
eat
thee
not
this
contention
lasted
long
till
at
length
i
let
myself
so
far
be
persuaded
as
to
go
into
his
hut
with
him
wherein
was
poverty
the
housekeeper
hunger
the
cook
and
want
clerk
of
the
kitchen
there
was
my
belly
cheered
with
herbs
and
a
draught
of
water
and
my
mind
which
was
altogether
distraught
again
brought
to
right
reason
by
the
old
man
comfortable
kindness
thereafter
then
i
easily
allowed
myself
to
be
enticed
by
the
charm
of
sweet
slumber
to
pay
my
debt
to
nature
now
when
the
hermit
perceived
my
need
of
sleep
he
left
me
to
occupy
my
place
in
his
hut
alone
for
one
only
could
lie
therein
so
about
midnight
i
awoke
again
and
heard
him
sing
the
song
which
followeth
here
which
i
afterwards
did
learn
by
heart
come
joy
of
night
o
nightingale
take
up
take
up
thy
cheerful
tale
sing
sweet
and
loud
and
long
come
praise
thine
own
creator
blest
when
other
birds
are
gone
to
rest
and
now
have
hushed
their
song
chorus
with
thy
voice
loud
rejoice
for
so
thou
best
canst
shew
thy
love
to
god
who
reigns
in
heaven
above
for
though
the
light
of
day
be
flown
and
we
in
darkness
dwell
alone
yet
can
we
chant
and
sing
of
god
his
power
and
god
his
might
nor
darkness
hinders
us
nor
night
our
praises
so
to
bring
echo
the
wanderer
makes
reply
and
when
thou
singst
will
still
be
by
and
still
repeat
thy
strain
all
weariness
she
drives
afar
and
sloth
to
which
we
prisoners
are
and
mocks
at
slumber
chain
the
stars
that
stand
in
heaven
above
do
shew
to
god
their
praise
and
love
and
honour
to
him
bring
and
owls
by
nature
reft
of
song
yet
shew
with
cries
the
whole
night
long
their
love
to
god
the
king
come
hither
then
sweet
bird
of
night
for
we
will
share
no
sluggard
plight
nor
sleep
away
the
hours
but
till
the
rosy
break
of
day
chase
from
these
woods
the
night
away
god
praise
shall
still
be
ours
now
while
this
song
did
last
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
nightingale
owl
and
echo
had
of
a
truth
joined
therein
and
had
i
ever
heard
the
morning
star
or
had
been
able
to
play
its
melody
on
my
bagpipe
i
had
surely
run
out
of
the
hut
to
take
my
trick
also
so
sweet
did
this
harmony
seem
to
me
yet
i
fell
asleep
again
and
woke
not
till
day
was
far
advanced
when
the
hermit
stood
before
me
and
said
up
child
i
will
give
thee
to
eat
and
thereafter
shew
thee
the
way
through
the
wood
so
that
thou
comest
to
where
people
dwell
and
also
before
night
to
the
nearest
village
so
i
asked
him
what
be
these
things
people
and
village
what
says
he
hast
never
been
in
any
village
and
knowest
not
what
people
or
folks
be
nay
said
i
nowhere
save
here
have
i
been
yet
tell
me
what
be
these
things
folk
and
people
and
village
god
save
us
answered
the
hermit
art
thou
demented
or
very
cunning
nay
said
i
i
am
my
mammy
and
dad
boy
and
neither
master
demented
nor
master
cunning
then
the
hermit
shewed
his
amazement
with
sighs
and
crossing
of
himself
and
says
he
is
well
dear
child
i
am
determined
if
god
will
better
to
instruct
thee
so
then
our
questions
and
answers
fell
out
as
the
ensuing
chapter
sheweth
how
simplicissimus
by
his
noble
discourse
proclaimed
his
excellent
qualities
hermit
what
is
thy
name
simplicissimus
my
name
is
lad
i
can
see
well
enough
that
thou
art
no
girl
but
how
did
thy
father
and
mother
call
thee
i
never
had
either
father
or
mother
who
gave
thee
then
thy
shirt
oho
why
my
mammy
what
did
thy
mother
call
thee
she
called
me
lad
ay
and
rogue
silly
gaby
and
gallowsbird
who
then
was
thy
mammy
husband
no
one
with
whom
then
did
thy
mammy
sleep
at
night
with
my
dad
what
did
thy
dad
call
thee
he
called
me
lad
what
was
his
name
his
name
was
dad
what
did
thy
mammy
call
him
dad
and
sometimes
also
master
did
she
never
call
him
aught
besides
yea
that
did
she
and
what
then
beast
coarse
brute
drunken
pig
and
other
the
like
when
she
would
scold
him
thou
beest
but
an
ignorant
creature
that
knowest
not
thy
name
nor
thine
own
oho
neither
dost
thou
know
it
canst
thou
say
thy
prayers
nay
my
mammy
and
our
ursel
did
uprear
the
beds
i
ask
thee
not
that
but
whether
thou
knowest
thy
paternoster
that
do
say
it
then
our
father
which
art
heaven
hallowed
be
name
to
thy
kingdom
come
thy
will
come
down
on
earth
as
it
says
heaven
give
us
debts
as
we
give
our
debtors
lead
us
not
into
no
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
the
kingdom

power
and
the
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
god
help
us
knowest
thou
naught
of
our
blessed
lord
god
yea
yea
is
he
that
stood
by
our
my
mammy
brought
him
home
from
the
church
feast
and
stuck
him
up
there
o
gracious
god
now
for
the
first
time
do
i
perceive
what
a
great
favour
and
benefit
it
is
when
thou
impartest
knowledge
of
thyself
and
how
naught
a
man
is
to
whom
thou
givest
it
not
o
lord
vouchsafe
to
me
so
to
honour
thy
holy
name
that
i
be
worthy
to
be
as
zealous
in
my
thanks
for
this
great
grace
as
thou
hast
been
liberal
in
the
granting
of
it
hark
now
simplicissimus
for
i
can
call
thee
by
no
other
name
when
thou
sayest
thy
paternoster
thou
must
say
this
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
thy
kingdom
come
thy
will
be
done
in
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
oho
there
ask
for
cheese
too
ah
dear
child
keep
silence
and
learn
that
thou
needest
more
than
cheese
thou
art
indeed
loutish
as
thy
mammy
told
thee
is
not
the
part
of
lads
like
thee
to
interrupt
an
old
man
but
to
be
silent
to
listen
and
to
learn
did
i
but
know
where
thy
parents
dwelt
i
would
fain
bring
thee
to
them
and
then
teach
them
how
to
bring
up
children
i
know
not
whither
to
go
our
house
is
burnt
and
my
mammy
ran
off
and
was
fetched
back
with
our
ursula
and
my
dad
too
and
our
maid
was
sick
and
lying
in
the
stable
and
who
did
burn
the
house
aha
there
came
iron
men
that
sat
on
things
as
big
as
oxen
yet
having
no
horns
which
same
men
did
slaughter
sheep
and
cows
and
swine
and
so
i
ran
too
and
then
was
the
house
burnt
where
was
thy
dad
then
aha
the
iron
men
tied
him
up
and
our
old
goat
was
set
to
lick
his
feet
so
he
must
needs
laugh
and
give
the
iron
men
many
silver
pennies
big
and
little
and
fair
yellow
things
and
some
that
glittered
and
fine
strings
full
of
little
white
balls
and
when
did
this
come
to
pass
why
even
when
i
should
have
been
keeping
of
sheep
yea
and
they
would
even
take
from
me
my
bagpipe
but
when
was
it
that
thou
shouldst
have
been
keeping
sheep
what
canst
thou
not
hear
even
then
when
the
iron
men
came
and
then
our
anna
bade
me
run
away
or
the
soldiers
would
carry
me
off
and
by
that
she
meant
the
iron
men
so
i
ran
off
and
so
i
came
hither
and
whither
wilt
thou
now
truly
i
know
not
i
will
stay
here
with
thee
nay
to
keep
thee
here
is
not
to
the
purpose
either
for
me
or
thee
eat
now
and
presently
i
will
bring
thee
where
people
are
oho
tell
me
now
what
manner
of
things
be
people
people
be
mankind
like
me
and
thee
thy
dad
thy
mammy
and
your
ann
be
mankind
and
when
there
be
many
together
then
are
they
called
people
and
now
go
thou
and
eat
so
was
our
discourse
in
which
the
hermit
often
gazed
on
me
with
deepest
sighs
i
know
not
whether
was
so
because
he
had
great
compassion
on
my
simplicity
and
ignorance
or
from
that
cause
which
i
learned
not
until
some
years
later
how
simplicissimus
was
changed
from
a
wild
beast
into
a
christian
so
i
began
to
eat
and
ceased
to
prattle
all
which
lasted
no
longer
than
till
i
had
appeased
mine
hunger
for
then
the
good
hermit
bade
me
begone
then
must
i
seek
out
the
most
flattering
words
which
my
rough
country
upbringing
afforded
me
and
all
to
this
end
to
move
the
hermit
that
he
should
keep
me
with
him
now
though
of
a
certainty
it
must
have
vexed
him
greatly
to
endure
my
troublesome
presence
yet
did
he
resolve
to
suffer
me
to
be
with
him
and
that
more
to
instruct
me
in
the
christian
religion
than
because
he
would
have
my
service
in
his
approaching
old
age
yet
was
this
his
greatest
anxiety
lest
my
tender
youth
should
not
endure
for
long
such
a
hard
way
of
living
as
was
his
a
space
of
some
three
weeks
was
my
year
of
probation
in
which
three
weeks
gertrude
was
at
war
with
the
gardeners
so
was
it
my
lot
to
be
inducted
into
the
profession
of
these
last
and
therein
i
carried
myself
so
well
that
the
good
hermit
took
an
especial
pleasure
in
me
and
that
not
so
much
for
my
work
sake
whereunto
i
was
before
well
trained
but
because
he
saw
that
i
myself
was
as
ready
greedily
to
hearken
to
his
instructions
as
the
waxen
soft
and
yet
smooth
tablet
of
my
mind
shewed
itself
ready
to
receive
such
for
such
reasons
he
was
the
more
zealous
to
bring
me
to
the
knowledge
of
all
good
things
so
he
began
his
instruction
from
the
fall
of
lucifer
thence
came
he
to
the
garden
of
eden
and
when
we
were
thrust
out
thence
with
our
first
parents
he
passed
through
the
law
of
moses
and
taught
me
by
the
means
of
the
ten
commandments
and
their
explications
of
which
commandments
he
would
say
that
they
were
a
true
measure
to
know
the
will
of
god
and
thereby
to
lead
a
life
holy
and
well
pleasing
to
god
to
discern
virtue
from
vice
to
do
the
good
and
to
avoid
the
evil
at
the
end
of
all
he
came
to
the
gospel
and
told
me
of
christ
birth
sufferings
death
and
resurrection
and
then
concluded
all
with
the
judgment
day
and
so
set
heaven
and
hell
before
my
eyes
and
this
all
with
befitting
circumstance
yet
not
with
superfluity
of
words
but
as
it
seemed
to
him
i
could
best
comprehend
and
understand
so
when
he
had
ended
one
matter
he
began
another
and
therewithal
contrived
with
all
patience
so
to
shape
himself
to
answer
my
questions
and
so
to
deal
with
me
that
better
he
could
not
have
shed
the
light
of
truth
into
my
heart
yet
were
his
life
and
his
speech
for
me
an
everlasting
preaching
and
this
my
mind
all
wooden
and
dull
as
it
was
yet
by
god
grace
left
not
fruitless
so
that
in
three
weeks
did
i
not
only
understand
all
that
a
christian
should
know
but
was
possessed
with
such
love
for
this
teaching
that
i
could
not
sleep
at
night
for
thinking
thereon
i
have
since
pondered
much
upon
this
matter
and
have
found
that
aristotle
in
his
second
book
of
the
soul
did
put
it
well
whereas
he
compared
the
soul
of
a
man
to
a
blank
unwritten
tablet
whereon
one
could
write
what
he
would
and
concluded
that
all
such
was
decreed
by
the
creator
of
the
world
in
order
that
such
blank
tablets
might
by
industrious
impression
and
exercise
be
marked
and
so
be
brought
to
completeness
and
perfection
and
so
saith
also
his
commentator
averroes
upon
that
passage
where
the
philosopher
saith
that
the
intellect
is
but
a
possibility
which
can
be
brought
into
activity
by
naught
else
than
by
scientia
or
knowledge
which
is
to
say
that
man
understanding
is
capable
of
all
things
yet
can
be
brought
to
such
knowledge
only
by
constant
exercise
and
giveth
this
plain
decision
namely
that
this
knowledge
or
exercise
is
the
perfecting
of
souls
which
have
no
power
at
all
in
them
selves
and
this
doth
cicero
confirm
in
his
second
book
of
the
tusculan
disputations
when
he
compares
the
soul
of
a
man
without
instruction
knowledge
and
exercise
to
a
field
which
albeit
fruitful
by
nature
yet
if
no
man
till
it
or
sow
it
will
bring
forth
no
fruit
and
all
this
did
i
prove
by
my
own
single
example
for
that
i
so
soon
understood
all
that
the
pious
hermit
shewed
to
me
arose
from
this
cause
that
he
found
the
smooth
tablet
of
my
soul
quite
empty
and
without
any
imaginings
before
entered
thereupon
which
might
well
have
hindered
the
impress
of
others
thereafter
yet
in
spite
of
all
that
pure
simplicity
in
comparison
with
other
men
ways
hath
ever
clung
to
me
and
therefore
did
the
hermit
for
neither
he
nor
i
knew
my
right
name
ever
call
me
simplicissimus
withal
i
learned
to
pray
and
when
the
good
hermit
had
resolved
himself
to
satisfy
my
earnest
desire
to
abide
with
him
we
built
for
me
a
hut
like
to
his
own
of
wood
twigs
and
earth
shaped
well
nigh
as
the
musqueteer
shapes
his
tent
in
camp
or
to
speak
more
exactly
as
the
peasant
in
some
places
shapes
his
so
low
in
truth
that
i
could
hardly
sit
upright
therein
my
bed
was
of
dried
leaves
and
grass
and
just
so
large
as
the
hut
itself
so
that
i
know
not
whether
to
call
such
a
or
hole
a
covered
bedstead
or
a
hut
in
what
manner
he
learned
to
read
and
write
in
the
wild
woods
now
when
first
i
saw
the
hermit
read
the
bible
i
could
not
conceive
with
whom
he
should
speak
so
secretly
and
as
i
thought
so
earnestly
for
well
i
saw
the
moving
of
his
lips
yet
no
man
that
spake
with
him
and
though
i
knew
naught
of
reading
or
writing
nevertheless
i
marked
by
his
eyes
that
he
had
to
do
with
somewhat
in
the
said
book
so
i
marked
where
he
kept
it
and
when
he
had
laid
it
aside
i
crept
thither
and
opened
it
and
at
the
first
assay
lit
upon
the
first
chapter
of
job
and
the
picture
that
stood
at
the
head
thereof
which
was
a
fine
woodcut
and
fairly
painted
so
i
began
to
ask
strange
questions
of
the
figures
and
when
they
gave
me
no
answer
waxed
impatient
and
even
as
the
hermit
came
up
behind
me
ye
little
clowns
said
i
have
ye
no
mouths
any
longer
could
ye
not
even
now
prate
away
long
enough
with
my
father
for
so
must
i
call
my
hermit
i
see
well
enough
that
ye
are
driving
away
the
gaffer
sheep
and
burning
of
his
house
wait
awhile
and
i
will
quench
your
fire
for
ye
and
with
that
rose
up
to
fetch
water
for
there
seemed
to
me
present
need
of
it
then
said
the
hermit
who
i
knew
not
was
behind
me
whither
away
simplicissimus
o
father
says
i
here
be
more
soldiers
that
will
drive
off
sheep
they
do
take
them
from
that
poor
man
with
whom
thou
didst
talk
and
here
is
his
house
and
if
i
quench
it
not
be
consumed
and
with
that
i
pointed
with
my
finger
to
what
i
saw
but
stay
quoth
the
hermit
for
these
figures
be
not
alive
to
which
i
with
rustic
courtesy
answered
him
what
beest
thou
blind
do
thou
keep
watch
lest
that
they
drive
the
sheep
away
while
i
do
seek
for
water
nay
quoth
he
again
but
they
be
not
alive
they
be
made
only
to
call
up
before
our
eyes
things
that
happened
long
ago
how
said
i
thou
didst
even
now
talk
with
them
how
then
can
they
be
not
alive
at
that
the
hermit
must
against
his
will
and
contrary
to
his
habit
laugh
and
dear
child
says
he
these
figures
can
not
talk
but
what
they
do
and
what
they
are
that
can
i
see
from
these
black
lines
and
that
do
men
call
reading
and
when
i
thus
do
read
thou
conceivest
that
i
speak
with
the
figures
but
is
not
so
yet
i
answered
him
if
i
be
a
man
as
thou
art
so
must
i
likewise
be
able
to
see
in
these
black
lines
what
thou
canst
see
how
then
may
i
understand
thy
words
dear
father
teach
me
in
truth
how
to
understand
this
matter
so
said
he
is
well
my
son
and
i
will
teach
thee
so
that
thou
mayest
speak
with
these
figures
as
well
as
i
only
need
time
in
which
i
must
have
patience
and
thou
industry
with
that
he
wrote
me
down
an
alphabet
on
birchbark
formed
like
print
and
when
i
knew
the
letters
i
learned
to
spell
and
thereafter
to
read
and
at
last
to
write
better
than
could
the
hermit
himself
for
i
imitated
print
in
everything
discourseth
of
foods
household
stuff
and
other
necessary
concerns
which
folk
must
have
in
this
earthly
life
in
that
wood
did
i
abide
for
about
two
years
until
the
hermit
died
and
after
his
death
somewhat
longer
than
a
and
therefore
it
seemeth
me
good
to
tell
to
the
curious
reader
who
often
desireth
to
know
even
the
smallest
matters
of
our
doings
our
ways
and
works
and
how
we
spent
our
life
now
our
food
was
vegetables
of
all
kinds
turnips
cabbage
beans
pease
and
the
like
nor
did
we
despise
wild
apples
pears
and
cherries
yea
and
our
hunger
often
made
even
acorns
savoury
to
us
our
bread
or
to
say
more
truly
our
cakes
we
baked
on
hot
ashes
and
they
were
made
of
italian
rye
beaten
fine
in
winter
we
would
catch
birds
with
springes
and
snares
but
in
spring
and
summer
god
bestowed
upon
us
young
fledglings
from
their
nest
often
must
we
make
out
with
snails
and
frogs
and
so
was
fishing
both
with
net
and
line
convenient
to
us
for
close
to
our
dwelling
there
flowed
a
brook
full
of
fish
and
crayfish
all
which
did
help
to
make
our
rough
vegetable
diet
palatable
once
on
a
time
did
we
catch
a
young
wild
pig
and
this
we
penned
in
a
stall
and
did
feed
him
with
acorns
and
so
fatted
him
and
at
last
did
eat
him
for
my
hermit
knew
it
could
be
no
sin
to
eat
that
which
god
hath
created
to
such
end
for
the
whole
human
race
of
salt
we
needed
but
little
and
spices
not
at
all
for
we
might
not
arouse
our
desire
to
drink
seeing
that
we
had
no
cellar
what
little
salt
we
wanted
a
good
pastor
furnished
us
who
dwelt
some
fifteen
miles
away
from
us
and
of
whom
i
shall
yet
have
much
to
tell
now
as
concerns
our
household
stuff
we
had
enough
for
we
had
a
shovel
a
pick
an
axe
a
hatchet
and
an
iron
pot
for
cooking
which
was
indeed
not
our
own
but
lent
to
us
by
the
said
pastor
each
of
us
had
an
old
blunt
knife
which
same
were
our
own
possessions
and
no
more
more
than
that
needed
we
naught
neither
dishes
plates
spoons
nor
forks
neither
kettles
gridirons
spits
no
nor
any
other
table
and
kitchen
ware
for
our
iron
pot
was
our
dish
our
hands
our
forks
and
spoons
and
if
we
would
drink
we
could
do
so
through
a
pipe
from
the
spring
or
else
we
dipped
our
mouths
like
gideon
soldiers
then
for
garments
of
wool
of
silk
of
cotton
and
of
linen
as
for
beds
and
tapestries
we
had
none
save
what
we
wore
upon
our
bodies
for
we
deemed
it
enough
if
we
could
shield
ourselves
from
rain
and
frost
at
other
times
we
kept
no
rule
or
order
in
our
household
save
on
sundays
and
at
which
time
we
would
start
on
our
way
at
midnight
so
that
we
might
come
early
enough
to
escape
men
notice
to
the
said
pastor
church
which
was
a
little
away
from
the
village
and
there
might
attend
service
when
we
came
thither
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
broken
organ
from
which
place
we
could
see
both
altar
and
pulpit
and
when
i
first
saw
the
pastor
go
up
to
the
pulpit
i
asked
my
hermit
what
he
would
do
in
that
great
tub
so
service
finished
we
went
home
as
secretly
as
we
had
come
and
when
we
found
ourselves
once
more
at
home
with
weary
body
and
weary
feet
then
did
we
eat
foul
food
with
fair
appetite
then
would
the
hermit
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
praying
and
in
the
instructing
of
me
in
holy
things
on
working
days
we
would
do
that
which
seemed
most
necessary
to
do
according
as
it
happened
and
as
such
was
required
by
the
time
of
year
and
by
our
needs
now
would
we
work
in
the
garden
another
time
we
gathered
together
the
rich
mould
in
shady
places
and
out
of
hollow
trees
to
improve
our
garden
therewith
in
place
of
dung
again
we
would
weave
baskets
or
or
chop
firewood
or
go
or
do
aught
to
banish
idleness
yet
among
all
these
occupations
did
the
good
hermit
never
cease
to
instruct
me
faithfully
in
all
good
things
and
meanwhile
did
i
learn
in
such
a
hard
life
to
endure
hunger
thirst
heat
cold
and
great
labour
and
before
all
things
to
know
god
and
how
one
should
serve
him
best
which
was
the
chiefest
thing
of
all
and
indeed
my
faithful
hermit
would
have
me
know
no
more
for
he
held
it
was
enough
for
any
christian
to
attain
his
end
and
aim
if
he
did
but
constantly
pray
and
work
so
it
came
about
that
though
i
was
pretty
well
instructed
in
ghostly
matters
and
knew
my
christian
belief
well
enough
and
could
speak
the
german
language
as
well
as
a
talking
yet
i
remained
the
most
simple
lad
in
the
world
so
that
when
i
left
the
wood
i
was
such
a
poor
sorry
creature
that
no
dog
would
have
left
his
bone
to
run
after
me
tells
of
a
notable
fine
way
to
die
happy
and
to
have
oneself
buried
at
small
cost
so
had
i
spent
two
years
or
thereabouts
and
had
scarce
grown
accustomed
to
the
hard
life
of
a
hermit
when
one
day
my
best
friend
on
earth
took
his
pick
gave
me
the
shovel
and
led
me
by
the
hand
according
to
his
daily
custom
to
our
garden
where
we
were
wont
to
say
our
prayers
now
simplicissimus
dear
child
said
he
inasmuch
as
god
be
praised
the
time
is
at
hand
when
i
must
part
from
this
earth
and
must
pay
the
debt
of
nature
and
leave
thee
behind
me
in
this
world
and
whereas
i
do
partly
foresee
the
future
course
of
thy
life
and
do
know
well
that
thou
wilt
not
long
abide
in
this
wilderness
therefore
did
i
desire
to
strengthen
thee
in
the
way
of
virtue
which
thou
hast
entered
on
and
to
give
thee
some
lessons
for
thy
instruction
by
means
of
which
thou
shouldest
so
rule
thy
life
that
as
though
by
an
unfailing
clue
thou
mightest
find
thy
way
to
eternal
happiness
and
so
with
all
elect
saints
mightest
be
found
worthy
for
ever
to
behold
the
face
of
god
in
that
other
life
these
words
did
drown
mine
eyes
in
tears
even
as
once
the
device
did
drown
the
town
of
villingen
in
a
word
they
were
so
terrible
that
i
could
not
endure
them
but
said
beloved
father
wilt
thou
then
leave
me
alone
in
this
wild
wood
must
i
then
and
more
i
could
not
say
for
my
heart
sorrow
was
by
reason
of
the
overflowing
love
which
i
bore
to
my
true
father
so
grievous
that
i
sank
at
his
feet
as
if
i
were
dead
yet
did
he
raise
me
up
and
comfort
me
so
far
as
time
and
opportunity
did
allow
and
would
shew
me
mine
own
error
in
that
he
asked
would
i
rebel
against
the
decree
of
the
almighty
and
knowest
thou
not
says
he
that
neither
heaven
nor
hell
can
do
that
nay
nay
my
son
why
dost
thou
propose
further
to
burden
my
weak
body
which
of
itself
is
but
desirous
of
rest
thinkest
thou
to
force
me
to
sojourn
longer
in
this
vale
of
tears
ah
no
my
son
let
me
go
for
in
any
case
neither
with
lamentation
and
tears
nor
still
less
with
my
good
will
canst
thou
compel
me
to
dwell
longer
in
this
misery
when
i
am
by
god
express
will
called
away
therefrom
instead
of
all
this
useless
clamour
follow
thou
my
last
words
which
are
these
the
longer
thou
livest
seek
to
know
thyself
the
better
and
if
thou
live
as
long
as
methuselah
yet
let
not
such
practice
depart
from
thy
heart
for
that
most
men
do
come
to
perdition
this
is
the
cause
namely
that
they
know
not
what
they
have
been
and
what
they
can
or
must
be
and
further
he
exhorted
me
i
should
at
all
times
beware
of
bad
company
for
the
harm
of
that
was
unspeakable
of
that
he
gave
me
an
example
saying
if
thou
puttest
a
drop
of
malmsey
into
a
vessel
full
of
vinegar
forthwith
it
turns
to
vinegar
but
if
thou
pour
a
drop
of
vinegar
into
malmsey
that
drop
will
disappear
into
the
wine
beloved
son
before
all
things
be
steadfast
for
whoso
endureth
to
the
end
he
shall
be
saved
but
if
it
happen
contrary
to
my
hopes
that
thou
from
human
weakness
dost
fall
then
by
a
fitting
penitence
raise
thyself
up
again
now
this
careful
and
pious
man
gave
me
but
this
brief
counsel
not
because
he
knew
no
more
but
because
in
sober
truth
i
seemed
to
him
by
reason
of
my
youth
not
able
to
comprehend
more
in
such
a
case
and
again
because
few
words
be
better
to
hold
in
remembrance
than
long
discourse
and
if
they
have
pith
and
point
do
work
greater
good
when
they
be
pondered
on
than
any
long
sermon
which
a
man
may
well
understand
as
spoken
and
yet
is
wont
presently
to
forget
and
these
three
points
to
know
oneself
to
avoid
bad
company
and
to
stand
steadfast
this
holy
man
without
doubt
deemed
good
and
necessary
because
he
had
made
trial
of
them
in
his
own
case
and
had
not
found
them
to
fail
for
coming
to
know
himself
he
eschewed
not
only
bad
company
but
that
of
the
whole
world
and
in
that
plan
did
persevere
to
the
end
on
which
doubtless
all
salvation
doth
depend
so
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
began
with
his
mattock
to
dig
his
own
grave
and
i
helped
as
best
i
could
in
whatever
way
he
bade
me
yet
did
i
not
conceive
to
what
end
all
this
was
then
said
he
my
dear
and
only
true
son
for
besides
thee
i
never
begat
creature
for
the
honour
of
our
creator
when
my
soul
is
gone
to
its
own
place
then
do
thy
duty
to
my
body
and
pay
me
the
last
honours
cover
me
up
with
these
same
clods
which
we
have
even
now
dug
from
this
pit
and
thereupon
he
took
me
in
his
arms
and
kissing
me
pressed
me
harder
to
his
breast
than
would
seem
possible
for
a
man
so
weak
as
he
appeared
to
be
and
dear
child
says
he
i
commend
thee
to
god
his
protection
and
die
the
more
cheerfully
because
i
hope
he
will
receive
thee
therein
yet
could
i
do
naught
but
lament
and
cry
yea
did
hang
upon
the
chains
which
he
wore
on
his
neck
and
thought
thereby
to
prevent
him
from
leaving
me
but
my
son
says
he
let
me
go
that
i
may
see
if
the
grave
be
long
enough
for
me
and
therewith
he
laid
aside
the
chains
together
with
his
outer
garment
and
so
entered
the
pit
even
as
one
that
will
lie
down
to
sleep
saying
almighty
god
receive
again
the
soul
that
thou
hast
given
lord
into
thy
hands
i
commend
my
spirit
thereupon
did
he
calmly
close
his
lips
and
his
eyes
while
i
stood
there
like
a
stockfish
and
dreamt
not
that
his
dear
soul
could
so
have
left
the
body
for
often
i
had
seen
him
in
such
trances
and
so
now
as
was
my
wont
in
such
a
case
i
waited
there
for
hours
praying
by
the
grave
but
when
my
beloved
hermit
arose
not
again
i
went
down
into
the
grave
to
him
and
began
to
shake
to
kiss
and
to
caress
him
but
there
was
no
life
in
him
for
grim
and
pitiless
death
had
robbed
the
poor
simplicissimus
of
his
holy
companionship
then
did
i
bedew
or
to
say
better
did
embalm
with
my
tears
his
lifeless
body
and
when
i
had
for
a
long
time
run
up
and
down
with
miserable
cries
began
to
heap
earth
upon
him
with
more
sighs
than
shovelfuls
and
hardly
had
i
covered
his
face
when
i
must
go
down
again
and
uncover
it
afresh
that
i
might
see
it
and
kiss
it
once
more
and
so
i
went
on
all
day
till
i
had
finished
and
in
this
way
ended
all
the
funeral
an
exequiae
and
ludi
gladiatorii
wherein
neither
bier
coffin
pall
lights
bearers
nor
mourners
were
at
hand
nor
any
clergy
to
sing
over
the
dead
how
simplicissimus
was
driven
about
like
a
straw
in
a
whirlpool
now
a
few
days
after
the
hermit
decease
i
betook
myself
to
the
pastor
above
mentioned
and
declared
to
him
my
master
death
and
therewith
besought
counsel
from
him
how
i
should
act
in
such
a
case
and
though
he
much
dissuaded
me
from
living
longer
in
the
forest
yet
did
i
boldly
tread
on
in
my
predecessor
footsteps
inasmuch
as
for
the
whole
summer
i
did
all
that
a
holy
monk
should
do
but
as
time
changeth
all
things
so
by
degrees
the
grief
which
i
felt
for
my
hermit
grew
less
and
less
and
the
sharp
cold
of
winter
without
quenched
the
heat
of
my
steadfast
purpose
within
and
the
more
i
began
to
falter
the
lazier
did
i
become
in
my
prayers
for
in
place
of
dwelling
ever
upon
godly
and
heavenly
thoughts
i
let
myself
be
overcome
by
the
desire
to
see
the
world
and
inasmuch
as
for
this
purpose
i
could
do
no
good
in
my
forest
i
determined
to
go
again
to
the
said
pastor
and
ask
if
he
again
would
counsel
me
to
leave
the
wood
to
that
end
i
betook
myself
to
his
village
which
when
i
came
thither
i
found
in
flames
for
a
party
of
troopers
had
but
now
plundered
and
burned
it
and
of
the
peasants
killed
some
driven
some
away
and
some
had
made
prisoners
among
whom
was
the
pastor
himself
ah
god
how
full
is
man
life
of
care
and
disappointment
scarce
hath
one
misfortune
ended
and
lo
we
are
in
another
i
wonder
not
that
the
heathen
philosopher
timon
set
up
many
gallows
at
athens
whereon
men
might
string
themselves
up
and
so
with
brief
pain
make
an
end
to
their
wretched
life
these
troopers
were
even
now
ready
to
march
and
had
the
pastor
fastened
by
a
rope
to
lead
him
away
some
cried
shoot
him
down
the
rogue
others
would
have
money
from
him
but
he
lifting
up
his
hands
to
heaven
begged
for
the
sake
of
the
last
judgment
for
forbearance
and
christian
compassion
but
in
vain
for
one
of
them
rode
him
down
and
dealt
him
such
a
blow
on
the
head
that
he
fell
flat
and
commended
his
soul
to
god
nor
did
the
remainder
of
the
captured
peasants
fare
any
better
but
even
when
it
seemed
these
troopers
in
their
cruel
tyranny
had
clean
lost
their
wits
came
such
a
swarm
of
armed
peasants
out
of
the
wood
that
it
seemed
a
had
been
stirred
and
these
began
to
yell
so
frightfully
and
so
furiously
to
attack
with
sword
and
musket
that
all
my
hair
stood
on
end
and
never
had
i
been
at
such
a
merrymaking
before
for
the
peasants
of
the
spessart
and
the
vogelsberg
are
as
little
wont
as
are
the
hessians
and
men
of
the
sauerland
and
the
black
forest
to
let
themselves
be
crowed
over
on
their
own
dunghill
so
away
went
the
troopers
and
not
only
left
behind
the
cattle
they
had
captured
but
threw
away
bag
and
baggage
also
and
so
cast
all
their
booty
to
the
winds
lest
themselves
should
become
booty
for
the
peasants
yet
some
of
them
fell
into
their
hands
this
sport
took
from
me
all
desire
to
see
the
world
for
i
thought
if
is
all
like
this
then
is
the
wilderness
far
more
pleasant
yet
would
i
fain
hear
what
the
pastor
had
to
say
of
it
who
was
by
reason
of
wounds
and
blows
received
faint
weak
and
feeble
yet
he
made
shift
to
tell
me
he
knew
not
how
to
help
or
advise
me
since
he
himself
was
now
in
a
plight
in
which
he
might
well
have
to
seek
his
bread
by
begging
and
if
i
should
remain
longer
in
the
woods
i
could
hope
no
more
for
help
from
him
since
as
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
both
his
church
and
his
parsonage
were
in
flames
thereupon
i
betook
myself
sorrowfully
to
my
dwelling
in
the
wood
and
because
on
this
journey
i
had
been
but
little
comforted
yet
on
the
other
hand
had
become
more
full
of
pious
thoughts
therefore
i
resolved
never
more
to
leave
the
wilderness
and
already
i
pondered
whether
it
were
not
possible
for
me
to
live
without
salt
which
the
pastor
had
until
now
furnished
me
with
and
so
do
without
mankind
altogether
a
quaint
comedia
of
five
peasants
so
now
that
i
might
follow
up
my
design
and
become
a
true
anchorite
i
put
on
my
hermit
which
he
had
left
me
and
girded
me
with
his
chain
over
it
not
indeed
as
if
i
needed
it
to
mortify
my
unruly
flesh
but
that
i
might
be
like
to
my
both
in
life
and
in
habit
and
moreover
might
by
such
clothes
be
the
better
able
to
protect
myself
against
the
rough
cold
of
winter
but
the
second
day
after
the
village
had
been
plundered
and
burnt
as
i
was
sitting
in
my
hut
and
praying
at
the
same
time
roasting
carrots
for
my
food
over
the
fire
there
surrounded
me
forty
or
fifty
musqueteers
and
these
though
amazed
at
the
strangeness
of
my
person
yet
ransacked
my
hut
seeking
what
was
not
there
to
find
for
nothing
had
i
but
books
and
these
they
threw
this
way
and
that
as
useless
to
them
but
at
last
when
they
regarded
me
more
closely
and
saw
by
my
feathers
what
a
poor
bird
they
had
caught
they
could
easily
reckon
there
was
poor
booty
to
be
found
where
i
was
and
much
they
wondered
at
my
hard
way
of
life
and
shewed
great
pity
for
my
tender
youth
specially
their
officer
that
commanded
them
for
he
shewed
me
respect
and
earnestly
besought
me
that
i
would
shew
him
and
his
men
the
way
out
of
the
wood
wherein
they
had
long
been
wandering
nor
did
i
refuse
but
led
them
the
nearest
way
to
the
village
even
where
the
pastor
had
been
so
ill
handled
for
i
knew
no
other
road
now
before
we
were
out
of
the
wood
we
espied
some
ten
peasants
of
whom
part
were
armed
with
musquets
while
the
rest
were
busied
with
burying
something
so
our
musqueteers
ran
upon
them
crying
stay
stay
but
they
answered
with
a
discharge
of
shot
and
when
they
saw
they
were
outnumbered
by
the
soldiers
away
they
went
so
quick
that
none
of
the
musqueteers
being
weary
could
overtake
them
so
then
they
would
dig
up
again
what
the
peasants
had
been
burying
and
that
was
the
easier
because
they
had
left
the
mattocks
and
spades
which
they
used
lying
there
but
they
had
made
few
strokes
with
the
pick
when
they
heard
a
voice
from
below
crying
out
o
ye
wanton
rogues
o
ye
worst
of
villains
think
ye
that
heaven
will
leave
your
heathenish
cruelty
and
tricks
unpunished
nay
for
there
live
yet
honest
fellows
by
whom
your
barbarity
shall
be
paid
in
such
wise
that
none
of
your
fellow
men
shall
think
you
worth
even
a
kick
of
his
foot
so
the
soldiers
looked
on
one
another
in
amazement
and
knew
not
what
to
do
for
some
thought
they
had
to
deal
with
a
ghost
to
me
it
seemed
i
was
dreaming
but
the
officer
bade
them
dig
on
stoutly
and
presently
they
came
to
a
cask
which
they
burst
open
and
therein
found
a
fellow
that
had
neither
nose
nor
ears
and
yet
still
lived
he
when
he
was
somewhat
revived
and
had
recognised
some
of
the
troop
told
them
how
on
the
day
before
as
some
of
his
regiment
were
the
peasants
had
caught
six
of
them
and
of
these
they
first
of
all
about
an
hour
before
had
shot
five
dead
at
once
making
them
stand
one
behind
another
and
because
the
bullet
having
already
passed
through
five
bodies
did
not
reach
him
who
stood
sixth
and
last
they
had
cut
off
his
nose
and
ears
yet
before
that
had
forced
him
to
render
to
five
of
them
the
filthiest
service
in
the
world
but
when
he
saw
himself
thus
degraded
by
these
rogues
without
shame
or
knowledge
of
god
he
had
heaped
upon
them
the
vilest
reproaches
though
they
were
willing
now
to
let
him
go
yet
in
the
hope
one
of
them
would
from
annoyance
send
a
ball
through
his
head
he
called
them
all
by
their
right
names
yet
in
vain
only
this
that
when
he
had
thus
chafed
them
they
had
clapped
him
in
the
cask
here
present
and
buried
him
alive
saying
since
he
so
desired
death
they
would
not
cheat
him
of
his
amusement
now
while
the
fellow
thus
lamented
the
torments
he
had
endured
came
another
party
of
by
a
cross
road
through
the
wood
who
had
met
the
abovementioned
boors
caught
five
and
shot
the
rest
dead
and
among
the
prisoners
were
four
to
whom
that
maltreated
trooper
had
been
forced
to
do
that
filthy
service
a
little
before
so
now
when
both
parties
had
found
by
their
manner
of
hailing
one
another
that
they
were
of
the
same
army
they
joined
forces
and
again
must
hear
from
the
trooper
himself
how
it
had
fared
with
him
and
his
comrades
and
there
might
any
man
tremble
and
quake
to
see
how
these
same
peasants
were
handled
for
some
in
their
first
fury
would
say
shoot
them
down
but
others
said
nay
these
wanton
villains
must
we
first
properly
torment
yea
and
make
them
to
understand
in
their
own
bodies
what
they
have
deserved
as
regards
the
person
of
this
same
trooper
and
all
the
time
while
this
discussion
proceeded
these
peasants
received
such
mighty
blows
in
the
ribs
from
the
butts
of
their
musquets
that
i
wondered
they
did
not
spit
blood
but
presently
stood
forth
a
soldier
and
said
he
you
gentlemen
seeing
that
it
is
a
shame
to
the
whole
profession
of
arms
that
this
rogue
and
therewith
he
pointed
to
that
same
unhappy
trooper
have
so
shamefully
submitted
himself
to
the
will
of
five
boors
it
is
surely
our
duty
to
wash
out
this
spot
of
shame
and
compel
these
rogues
to
do
the
same
shameful
service
for
this
trooper
which
they
forced
him
to
do
for
them
but
another
said
this
fellow
is
not
worth
having
such
honour
done
to
him
for
were
he
not
a
poltroon
surely
he
would
not
have
done
such
shameful
service
to
the
shame
of
all
honest
soldiers
but
would
a
thousand
times
sooner
have
died
in
a
word
was
decided
with
one
voice
that
each
of
the
captured
peasants
should
do
the
same
filthy
service
for
ten
soldiers
which
their
comrade
had
been
forced
to
do
and
each
time
should
say
so
do
i
cleanse
and
wash
away
the
shame
which
these
soldiers
think
they
have
endured
thereafter
they
would
decide
how
they
should
deal
with
the
peasants
when
they
had
fulfilled
this
cleanly
task
so
presently
they
went
to
work
but
the
peasants
were
so
obstinate
that
neither
by
promise
of
their
lives
nor
by
any
torture
could
they
be
compelled
thereto
then
one
took
the
fifth
peasant
who
had
not
maltreated
the
trooper
a
little
aside
and
says
he
if
thou
wilt
deny
god
and
all
his
saints
i
will
let
thee
go
whither
thou
wilt
thereupon
the
peasant
made
reply
he
had
in
all
his
life
taken
little
count
of
saints
and
had
had
but
little
traffic
with
god
and
added
thereto
with
a
solemn
oath
he
knew
not
god
and
had
no
art
nor
part
in
his
kingdom
so
then
the
soldier
sent
a
ball
at
his
head
which
worked
as
little
harm
as
if
it
had
been
shot
at
a
mountain
of
steel
then
he
drew
out
his
hanger
and
beest
thou
still
here
says
he
i
promised
to
let
thee
go
whither
thou
wouldst
see
now
i
send
thee
to
the
kingdom
of
hell
since
thou
wilt
not
to
heaven
and
so
he
split
his
head
down
to
the
teeth
and
as
he
fell
so
said
the
soldier
must
a
man
avenge
himself
and
punish
these
loose
rogues
both
in
this
world
and
the
next
meanwhile
the
other
soldiers
had
the
remaining
four
peasants
to
deal
with
these
they
bound
hands
and
feet
together
over
a
fallen
tree
in
such
wise
that
their
saving
your
presence
were
uppermost
then
they
stript
off
their
breeches
and
took
some
yards
of
their
and
made
knots
in
it
and
fiddled
them
therewith
so
mercilessly
that
the
blood
ran
so
they
cried
out
lamentably
but
was
but
sport
for
the
soldiers
who
ceased
not
to
saw
away
till
skin
and
flesh
were
clean
sawn
off
the
bones
me
they
let
go
to
my
hut
for
the
party
knew
the
way
well
and
so
i
know
not
how
they
finished
with
the
peasants
how
simplicissimus
was
plundered
and
how
he
dreamed
of
the
peasants
and
how
they
fared
in
times
of
war
now
when
i
came
home
i
found
that
my
fireplace
and
all
my
poor
furniture
together
with
my
store
of
provisions
which
i
had
grown
during
the
summer
in
my
garden
and
had
kept
for
the
coming
winter
were
all
gone
and
whither
now
thought
i
and
then
first
did
need
teach
me
heartily
to
pray
and
i
must
summon
all
my
small
wits
together
to
devise
what
i
should
do
but
as
my
knowledge
of
the
world
was
both
small
and
evil
i
could
come
to
no
proper
conclusion
only
that
was
best
to
commend
myself
to
god
and
to
put
my
whole
confidence
in
him
for
otherwise
i
must
perish
and
besides
all
this
those
things
which
i
had
heard
and
seen
that
day
lay
heavy
on
my
mind
and
i
pondered
not
so
much
upon
my
food
and
my
sustenance
as
upon
the
enmity
which
there
is
ever
between
soldiers
and
peasants
yet
could
my
foolish
mind
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
this
that
there
must
of
a
surety
be
two
races
of
men
in
the
world
and
not
one
only
descended
from
adam
but
two
wild
and
tame
like
other
unreasoning
beasts
and
therefore
pursuing
one
another
so
cruelly
with
such
thoughts
i
fell
asleep
for
mere
misery
and
cold
with
a
hungry
stomach
then
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
in
a
dream
that
all
the
trees
which
stood
round
my
dwelling
suddenly
changed
and
took
on
another
appearance
for
on
every
sat
a
trooper
and
the
trunks
were
garnished
in
place
of
leaves
with
all
manner
of
folk
of
these
some
had
long
lances
others
musquets
hangers
halberts
flags
and
some
drums
and
fifes
now
this
was
merry
to
see
for
all
was
neatly
distributed
and
each
according
to
his
rank
the
roots
moreover
were
made
up
of
folk
of
little
worth
as
mechanics
and
labourers
mostly
however
peasants
and
the
like
and
these
nevertheless
gave
its
strength
to
the
tree
and
renewed
the
same
when
it
was
lost
yea
more
they
repaired
the
loss
of
any
fallen
leaves
from
among
themselves
to
their
own
great
damage
and
all
the
time
they
lamented
over
them
that
sat
on
the
tree
and
that
with
good
reason
for
the
whole
weight
of
the
tree
lay
upon
them
and
pressed
them
so
that
all
the
money
was
squeezed
out
of
their
pockets
yea
though
it
was
behind
seven
locks
and
keys
but
if
the
money
would
not
out
then
did
the
commissaries
so
handle
them
with
rods
which
thing
they
call
military
execution
that
sighs
came
from
their
heart
tears
from
their
eyes
blood
from
their
nails
and
the
marrow
from
their
bones
yet
among
these
were
some
whom
men
call
light
o
heart
and
these
made
but
little
ado
took
all
with
a
shrug
and
in
the
midst
of
their
torment
had
in
place
of
comfort
mockery
for
every
turn
of
the
ways
and
works
of
soldiers
nowadays
and
how
hardly
a
common
soldier
can
get
promotion
so
must
the
roots
of
these
trees
suffer
and
endure
toil
and
misery
in
the
midst
of
trouble
and
complaint
and
those
upon
the
lower
boughs
in
yet
greater
hardship
yet
were
these
last
mostly
merrier
than
the
first
named
yea
and
moreover
insolent
and
swaggering
and
for
the
most
part
godless
folk
and
for
the
roots
a
heavy
unbearable
burden
at
all
times
and
this
was
the
rhyme
upon
them
hunger
and
thirst
and
cold
and
heat
and
work
and
woe
and
all
we
meet
and
deeds
of
blood
and
deeds
of
shame
all
may
ye
put
to
the
landsknecht
name
which
rhymes
were
the
less
like
to
be
lyingly
invented
in
that
they
answered
to
the
facts
for
gluttony
and
drunkenness
hunger
and
thirst
wenching
and
dicing
and
playing
riot
and
roaring
murdering
and
being
murdered
slaying
and
being
slain
torturing
and
being
tortured
hunting
and
being
hunted
harrying
and
being
harried
robbing
and
being
robbed
frighting
and
being
frighted
causing
trouble
and
suffering
trouble
beating
and
being
beaten
in
a
word
hurting
and
harming
and
in
turn
being
hurt
and
harmed
this
was
their
whole
life
and
in
this
career
they
let
nothing
hinder
them
neither
winter
nor
summer
snow
nor
ice
heat
nor
cold
rain
nor
wind
hill
nor
dale
wet
nor
dry
ditches
ramparts
and
walls
fire
and
water
were
all
the
same
to
them
father
nor
mother
sister
nor
brother
no
nor
the
danger
to
their
own
bodies
souls
and
consciences
nor
even
loss
of
life
and
of
heaven
itself
or
aught
else
that
can
be
named
will
ever
stand
in
their
way
for
ever
they
toil
and
moil
at
their
own
strange
work
till
at
last
little
by
little
in
battles
sieges
attacks
campaigns
yea
and
in
their
winter
quarters
too
which
are
the
soldiers
earthly
paradise
if
they
can
but
happen
upon
fat
peasants
they
perish
they
die
they
rot
and
consume
away
save
but
a
few
who
in
their
old
age
unless
they
have
been
right
thrifty
reivers
and
robbers
do
furnish
us
with
the
best
of
all
beggars
and
vagabonds
next
above
these
folk
sat
old
who
after
some
years
and
much
peril
of
their
lives
had
climbed
up
the
lowest
branches
and
clung
to
them
and
so
far
had
had
the
luck
to
escape
death
now
these
looked
more
serious
and
somewhat
more
dignified
than
the
lowest
in
that
they
were
a
degree
higher
ascended
yet
above
them
were
some
yet
higher
who
had
yet
loftier
imaginings
because
they
had
to
command
the
very
lowest
and
these
people
did
call
because
they
were
wont
to
dust
the
jackets
of
the
poor
pikemen
and
to
give
the
musqueteers
oil
enough
to
grease
their
barrels
with
just
above
these
the
trunk
of
the
tree
had
an
interval
or
stop
which
was
a
smooth
place
without
branches
greased
with
all
manner
of
ointments
and
curious
soap
of
disfavour
so
that
no
man
save
of
noble
birth
could
scale
it
in
spite
of
courage
and
skill
and
knowledge
god
knows
how
clever
he
might
be
for
was
polished
as
smooth
as
a
marble
pillar
or
a
steel
mirror
just
over
that
smooth
spot
sat
they
with
the
flags
and
of
these
some
were
young
some
pretty
well
in
years
the
young
folk
their
kinsmen
had
raised
so
far
the
older
people
had
either
mounted
on
a
silver
ladder
which
is
called
the
bribery
backstairs
or
else
on
a
step
which
fortune
for
want
of
a
better
client
had
left
for
them
a
little
further
up
sat
higher
folk
and
these
had
also
their
toil
and
care
and
annoyance
yet
had
they
this
advantage
that
they
could
fill
their
pokes
with
the
fattest
slices
which
they
could
cut
out
of
the
roots
and
that
with
a
knife
which
they
called
and
these
were
at
their
best
and
happiest
when
there
came
a
flying
overhead
and
shook
out
a
whole
panfull
of
gold
over
the
tree
to
cheer
them
for
of
that
they
caught
as
much
as
they
could
and
let
but
little
or
nothing
at
all
fall
to
the
lowest
branches
and
so
of
these
last
more
died
of
hunger
than
of
the
enemy
attacks
from
which
danger
those
placed
above
seemed
to
be
free
therefore
was
there
a
perpetual
climbing
and
swarming
going
on
on
those
trees
for
each
would
needs
sit
in
those
highest
and
happiest
places
yet
were
there
some
idle
worthless
rascals
not
worth
their
who
troubled
themselves
little
about
higher
places
and
only
did
their
duty
so
the
lowest
being
ambitious
hoped
for
the
fall
of
the
highest
that
they
might
sit
in
their
place
and
if
it
happened
to
one
among
ten
thousand
of
them
that
he
got
so
far
yet
would
such
good
luck
come
to
him
only
in
his
miserable
old
age
when
he
was
more
fit
to
sit
in
the
and
roast
apples
than
to
meet
the
foe
in
the
field
and
if
any
man
dealt
honestly
and
carried
himself
well
yet
was
he
ever
envied
by
others
and
perchance
by
reason
of
some
unlucky
chance
of
war
deprived
both
of
office
and
of
life
and
nowhere
was
this
more
grievous
than
at
the
smooth
place
on
the
tree
for
there
an
officer
who
had
had
a
good
sergeant
or
corporal
under
him
must
lose
him
however
unwillingly
because
he
was
now
made
an
ensign
and
for
that
reason
they
would
take
in
place
of
old
soldiers
inkslingers
footmen
overgrown
pages
poor
noblemen
and
at
times
poor
relations
tramps
and
vagabonds
and
these
took
the
very
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
those
that
had
deserved
it
and
forthwith
were
made
ensigns
how
it
happens
that
whereas
in
war
the
nobles
are
ever
put
before
the
common
men
yet
many
do
attain
from
despised
rank
to
high
honours
all
this
vexed
a
sergeant
so
much
that
he
began
loudly
to
complain
whereupon
one
nobilis
answered
him
knowst
thou
not
that
at
all
times
our
rulers
have
appointed
to
the
highest
offices
in
time
of
war
those
of
noble
birth
as
being
fittest
therefore
for
greybeards
defeat
no
foe
were
it
so
one
could
send
a
flock
of
goats
for
that
employ
we
say
choose
out
a
bull
that
young
and
strong
to
lead
and
keep
the
herd
for
though
the
veteran
be
good
the
young
must
be
preferred
so
let
the
herdsman
trust
to
him
full
young
though
he
appears
is
but
a
saw
and
is
no
law
that
wisdom
comes
with
years
tell
me
says
he
thou
old
cripple
not
true
that
nobly
born
officers
be
better
respected
by
the
soldiery
than
they
that
beforetime
have
been
but
servants
and
what
discipline
in
war
can
ye
find
where
no
respect
is
must
not
a
general
trust
a
gentleman
more
than
a
peasant
lad
that
had
run
away
from
his
father
at
the
and
so
done
his
own
parents
no
good
service
for
a
proper
gentleman
rather
than
bring
reproach
upon
his
family
by
treason
or
desertion
or
the
like
will
sooner
die
with
honour
and
so
is
right
the
gentles
should
have
the
first
place
so
doth
joannes
de
platea
plainly
lay
it
down
that
in
furnishing
of
offices
the
preference
should
ever
be
given
to
the
nobility
and
these
properly
set
before
the
commons
such
usage
is
to
be
found
in
all
codes
of
laws
and
is
moreover
confirmed
in
holy
writ
for
is
the
land
whose
king
is
of
noble
family
saith
sirach
in
his
tenth
chapter
which
is
a
noble
testimony
to
the
preference
belonging
to
gentle
birth
and
even
if
one
of
your
kidney
be
a
good
soldier
enough
that
can
smell
powder
and
play
his
part
well
in
every
venture
yet
is
he
not
therefore
capable
of
command
of
others
which
quality
is
natural
to
gentlemen
or
at
least
customary
to
them
from
their
youth
up
and
so
saith
seneca
hero
soul
hath
this
property
that
is
ever
alert
in
search
of
honour
and
no
lofty
spirit
hath
pleasure
in
small
and
unworthy
things
moreover
the
nobles
have
more
means
to
furnish
their
inferior
officers
with
money
and
to
procure
recruits
for
their
weak
companies
than
a
peasant
and
so
to
follow
the
common
proverb
it
were
not
well
to
put
the
boor
above
the
gentleman
yea
and
the
boors
would
soon
become
too
if
they
be
made
lords
straightway
for
men
say
will
ye
find
a
sharper
sword
than
peasant
churl
that
made
a
lord
now
had
the
peasants
by
reason
of
long
and
respectable
custom
possessed
all
offices
in
war
and
elsewhere
of
a
surety
they
would
have
let
no
gentleman
into
such
yea
and
besides
though
ye
soldiers
of
fortune
as
ye
call
yourselves
be
often
willingly
helped
to
raise
yourselves
to
higher
ranks
yet
ye
are
commonly
so
worn
out
that
when
they
try
you
and
would
find
you
a
better
place
they
must
hesitate
to
promote
you
for
the
heat
of
your
youth
is
cooled
down
and
your
only
thought
is
how
ye
can
tend
and
care
for
your
sick
bodies
which
by
reason
of
much
hardships
be
crippled
and
of
little
use
for
war
yea
and
a
young
dog
is
better
for
hunting
than
an
old
lion
then
answered
the
old
sergeant
and
what
fool
would
be
a
soldier
if
he
might
not
hope
by
his
good
conduct
to
be
promoted
and
so
rewarded
for
faithful
service
devil
take
such
a
war
as
that
for
so
is
all
the
same
whether
a
man
behave
himself
well
or
ill
often
did
i
hear
our
old
colonel
say
he
wanted
no
soldier
in
his
regiment
that
had
not
the
firm
intention
to
become
a
general
by
his
good
conduct
and
all
the
world
must
acknowledge
that
is
those
nations
which
promote
common
soldiers
that
are
good
soldiers
too
that
win
victories
as
may
be
seen
in
the
case
of
the
turks
and
persians
so
says
the
verse
lamp
is
bright
yet
feed
it
well
with
oil
an
thou
dost
not
the
flame
sinks
down
and
dies
so
by
rewards
repay
the
soldiers
toil
for
service
brave
demands
its
pay
likewise
then
answered
nobilis
if
we
see
brave
qualities
and
in
an
honest
man
we
shall
not
overlook
them
for
at
this
very
time
see
how
many
there
be
who
from
the
plough
from
the
needle
from
shoemaking
and
from
shepherding
have
done
well
by
themselves
and
by
such
bravery
have
raised
themselves
up
far
above
the
poorer
nobility
to
the
ranks
of
counts
and
barons
who
was
the
imperialist
john
de
werth
who
was
the
swede
stalhans
who
were
the
hessians
little
jakob
and
andré
of
their
kind
there
were
many
yet
well
known
whom
i
for
brevity
sake
forbear
to
mention
so
is
it
nothing
new
in
the
present
time
nor
will
it
be
otherwise
in
the
future
that
honest
men
attain
by
war
to
great
honours
as
happened
also
among
the
ancients
tamburlaine
became
a
mighty
king
and
the
terror
of
the
whole
world
which
was
before
but
a
swineherd
agathocles
king
of
sicily
was
son
of
a
potter
emperor
valentinian
father
was
a
ropemaker
maurice
the
cappadocian
a
slave
was
emperor
after
tiberius
ii
justin
that
reigned
before
justinian
was
before
he
was
emperor
a
swineherd
hugh
capet
a
butcher
son
was
afterward
king
of
france
pizarro
likewise
a
swineherd
which
afterwards
was
marquess
in
the
west
indies
where
he
had
to
weigh
out
his
gold
in
hundredweights
the
sergeant
answered
all
this
sounds
fair
enough
for
my
purpose
yet
well
i
see
that
the
doors
by
which
we
might
win
to
many
dignities
be
shut
against
us
by
the
nobility
for
as
soon
as
he
is
crept
out
of
his
shell
forthwith
your
nobleman
is
clapped
into
such
a
position
as
we
can
not
venture
to
set
our
thoughts
upon
howbeit
we
have
done
more
than
many
a
noble
who
is
now
appointed
a
colonel
and
just
as
among
the
peasants
many
noble
talents
perish
for
want
of
means
to
keep
a
lad
at
his
studies
so
many
a
brave
soldier
grows
old
under
the
weight
of
a
musquet
that
more
properly
deserved
a
regiment
and
could
have
tendered
great
services
to
his
general
how
simplicissimus
took
his
first
step
into
the
world
and
that
with
evil
luck
i
cared
no
longer
to
listen
to
this
old
ass
but
grudged
him
not
his
complaints
for
often
he
himself
had
beaten
poor
soldiers
like
dogs
i
turned
again
to
the
trees
whereof
the
whole
land
was
full
and
saw
how
they
swayed
and
smote
against
each
other
and
the
fellows
tumbled
off
them
in
batches
now
a
crack
now
a
fall
one
moment
quick
the
next
dead
in
a
moment
one
lost
an
arm
another
a
leg
the
third
his
head
and
as
i
looked
methought
all
trees
i
saw
were
but
one
tree
at
whose
top
sat
the
mars
and
which
covered
with
its
branches
all
europe
it
seemed
to
me
this
tree
could
have
overshadowed
the
whole
world
but
because
it
was
blown
about
by
envy
and
hate
by
suspicion
and
unfairness
by
pride
and
haughtiness
and
avarice
and
other
such
fair
virtues
as
by
bitter
north
winds
therefore
it
seemed
thin
and
transparent
for
which
reason
one
had
writ
on
its
trunk
these
rhymes
the
holmoak
by
the
wind
beset
and
brought
to
ruin
breaks
its
own
branches
down
and
proves
its
own
undoing
by
civil
war
within
and
brothers
deadly
feud
alls
turned
and
misery
hath
ensued
by
the
mighty
roaring
of
these
cruel
winds
and
the
noise
of
the
breaking
of
the
tree
itself
i
was
awoke
from
my
sleep
and
found
myself
alone
in
my
hut
then
did
i
again
begin
to
ponder
what
i
should
do
for
to
remain
in
the
wood
was
impossible
since
i
had
been
so
utterly
despoiled
that
i
could
not
keep
myself
nothing
remained
to
me
but
a
few
books
which
lay
strewn
about
in
confusion
and
when
with
weeping
eyes
i
took
these
up
to
read
calling
earnestly
upon
god
that
he
would
lead
and
guide
me
whither
i
should
go
i
found
by
chance
a
letter
which
my
hermit
had
writ
in
his
lifetime
and
this
was
the
content
of
it
beloved
simplicissimus
when
thou
findest
this
letter
go
forthwith
out
of
the
forest
and
save
thyself
and
the
pastor
from
present
troubles
for
he
hath
done
me
much
good
god
whom
thou
must
at
all
times
have
before
thine
eyes
and
earnestly
pray
to
will
bring
thee
to
the
place
which
is
best
for
thee
only
keep
him
ever
in
thy
sight
and
be
diligent
ever
to
serve
him
as
if
thou
wert
still
in
my
presence
in
the
wood
consider
and
follow
without
ceasing
my
last
words
and
so
mayest
thou
stand
firm
farewell
i
kissed
this
letter
and
the
hermit
grave
many
thousand
times
and
started
on
my
way
to
seek
for
mankind
yet
before
i
could
find
them
i
journeyed
straight
on
for
two
whole
days
and
when
night
overtook
me
sought
out
a
hollow
tree
for
my
shelter
and
my
food
was
naught
but
which
i
picked
up
on
the
way
but
on
the
third
day
i
came
to
a
pretty
open
field
near
gelnhausen
and
there
i
enjoyed
a
veritable
banquet
for
the
whole
place
was
full
of
wheatsheaves
which
the
peasants
being
frightened
away
after
the
great
battle
of
nördlingen
had
for
my
good
fortune
not
been
able
to
carry
off
inside
a
sheaf
i
set
up
my
tent
for
was
cruel
cold
and
filled
my
belly
with
the
ears
of
corn
which
i
rubbed
in
my
hands
and
such
a
meal
i
had
not
enjoyed
for
a
long
time
how
simplicissimus
was
captured
by
hanau
and
hanau
by
simplicissimus
when
was
day
i
fed
myself
again
with
wheat
and
thereafter
betook
myself
to
gelnhausen
and
there
i
found
the
gates
open
and
partly
burnt
yet
half
barricaded
with
dung
so
i
went
in
but
was
ware
of
no
living
creature
there
indeed
the
streets
were
strewn
here
and
there
with
dead
some
of
whom
were
stripped
to
their
shirts
some
stark
naked
this
was
a
terrifying
spectacle
as
any
man
can
imagine
i
in
my
simplicity
could
not
guess
what
mishap
had
brought
the
place
to
such
a
plight
but
not
long
after
i
learned
that
the
imperialists
had
surprised
a
few
of
weimar
folk
there
and
hardly
had
i
gone
into
the
town
when
i
had
seen
enough
so
i
turned
me
about
and
went
across
the
meadows
and
presently
i
came
to
a
good
road
which
brought
me
to
the
fine
fortress
of
hanau
when
i
came
to
the
first
sentries
i
tried
to
pass
but
two
musqueteers
made
at
me
who
seized
me
and
took
me
off
to
their
now
must
i
first
describe
to
the
reader
my
wonderful
dress
at
that
time
before
i
tell
him
how
i
fared
further
for
my
clothing
and
behaviour
were
altogether
so
strange
astonishing
and
uncouth
that
the
governor
had
my
picture
painted
firstly
my
hair
had
for
two
years
and
a
half
never
been
cut
either
greek
german
or
french
fashion
nor
combed
nor
curled
nor
puffed
but
stood
in
its
natural
wildness
with
more
than
a
year
dust
strewn
on
it
instead
of
hair
plunder
or
powder
or
whatever
they
call
the
fools
work
and
that
so
prettily
that
i
looked
with
my
pale
face
underneath
it
like
a
great
white
owl
that
is
about
to
bite
or
else
watching
for
a
mouse
and
because
i
was
accustomed
at
all
times
to
go
bareheaded
and
my
hair
was
curly
i
had
the
look
of
wearing
a
turkish
turban
the
rest
of
my
garb
answered
to
my
for
i
had
on
my
hermit
coat
if
i
may
now
call
it
a
coat
at
all
for
the
stuff
out
of
which
was
fashioned
at
first
was
now
clean
gone
and
nothing
more
remaining
of
it
but
the
shape
which
more
than
a
thousand
little
patches
of
all
colours
some
put
side
by
side
some
sewn
upon
one
another
with
manifold
stitches
still
represented
over
this
decayed
and
yet
often
improved
coat
i
wore
the
for
i
needed
the
sleeves
for
breeches
and
had
cut
them
off
for
that
purpose
but
my
whole
body
was
girt
about
with
iron
chains
most
deftly
disposed
crosswise
behind
and
before
like
the
pictures
of
william
so
that
all
together
made
up
a
figure
like
them
that
have
once
been
captured
by
the
turks
and
now
wander
through
the
land
begging
for
their
friends
still
in
captivity
my
shoes
were
cut
out
of
wood
and
the
laces
woven
out
of
strips
of
and
my
feet
looked
like
boiled
lobsters
as
i
had
had
on
stockings
of
the
spanish
national
colour
or
had
dyed
my
skin
with
logwood
in
truth
i
believe
if
any
conjurer
mountebank
or
stroller
had
had
me
and
had
given
me
out
for
a
samoyede
or
a
greenlander
he
would
have
found
many
a
fool
that
would
have
wasted
a
kreutzer
on
me
yet
though
any
man
in
his
wits
could
easily
conclude
from
my
thin
and
starved
looks
and
my
decayed
clothes
i
came
neither
from
a
nor
a
lady
bower
and
still
less
had
played
truant
from
any
great
lord
court
nevertheless
i
was
strictly
examined
in
the
and
even
as
the
soldiers
gaped
at
me
so
was
i
filled
with
wonder
at
the
mad
apparel
of
their
officer
to
whom
i
must
answer
and
give
account
i
knew
not
if
it
were
he
or
she
for
he
wore
his
hair
and
beard
french
fashion
with
long
tails
hanging
down
on
each
side
like
and
his
beard
was
so
miserably
handled
and
mutilated
that
between
mouth
and
nose
there
were
but
a
few
hairs
and
those
had
come
off
so
ill
that
one
could
scarce
see
them
and
not
less
did
his
wide
breeches
leave
me
in
no
small
doubt
of
his
sex
being
such
that
they
were
as
like
a
petticoats
as
a
man
breeches
so
i
thought
if
this
be
a
man
he
should
have
a
proper
beard
since
the
rogue
is
not
so
young
as
he
pretends
but
if
a
woman
why
hath
the
old
witch
so
much
stubble
round
her
mouth
sure
is
a
woman
thought
i
for
no
honest
man
would
ever
let
his
beard
be
so
lamentably
bedevilled
seeing
that
even
goats
for
pure
shamefacedness
venture
not
a
step
among
a
strange
flock
when
their
beards
are
clipped
so
as
i
stood
in
doubt
knowing
not
of
modern
fashions
at
last
i
held
he
was
man
and
woman
at
once
and
this
mannish
woman
or
this
womanish
man
had
me
thoroughly
searched
but
could
find
nothing
on
me
but
a
little
book
of
wherein
i
had
written
down
my
daily
prayers
and
had
also
left
the
letter
which
my
pious
hermit
as
i
have
said
in
the
last
chapter
had
bequeathed
me
for
his
farewell
that
he
took
from
me
but
i
being
loath
to
part
from
it
fell
down
before
him
and
clasped
both
his
knees
and
o
my
good
hermaphrodite
says
i
leave
me
my
little
thou
fool
he
answered
who
the
devil
told
thee
my
name
was
hermann
and
therewith
commanded
two
soldiers
to
lead
me
to
the
governor
giving
them
the
book
to
take
with
them
for
indeed
this
fop
as
i
at
once
did
note
could
neither
read
nor
write
himself
so
i
was
led
into
the
town
and
all
ran
together
as
if
a
were
on
show
and
according
as
each
one
regarded
me
so
each
made
something
different
out
of
me
some
deemed
me
a
spy
others
a
wild
man
and
some
even
a
spirit
a
spectre
or
a
monster
that
should
portend
some
strange
happening
some
too
there
were
that
counted
me
a
mere
fool
and
they
had
indeed
come
nearest
to
the
mark
had
i
not
had
the
knowledge
of
god
our
father
in
what
wise
he
was
saved
from
prison
and
torture
now
when
i
was
brought
before
the
governor
he
asked
me
whence
i
came
i
said
i
knew
not
then
said
he
again
whither
wilt
thou
and
again
i
answered
i
know
not
what
the
devil
dost
thou
know
then
says
he
what
is
thy
business
i
answered
as
before
i
knew
not
he
asked
where
dost
thou
dwell
and
as
i
again
answered
i
knew
not
his
countenance
was
changed
i
know
not
whether
from
anger
or
astonishment
but
inasmuch
as
every
man
is
wont
to
suspect
evil
and
specially
the
enemy
being
in
the
neighbourhood
having
just
as
above
narrated
captured
gelnhausen
and
therein
put
to
shame
a
whole
regiment
of
dragoons
he
agreed
with
them
that
held
me
for
a
traitor
or
a
spy
and
ordered
that
i
should
be
searched
but
when
he
learned
from
the
soldiers
of
the
watch
that
this
was
already
done
and
nothing
more
found
on
me
than
the
book
there
present
which
they
delivered
to
him
he
read
a
line
or
two
therein
and
asked
who
had
given
me
the
book
i
answered
it
was
mine
from
the
beginning
for
i
had
made
it
and
written
it
then
he
asked
why
upon
i
answered
because
the
bark
of
other
trees
was
not
fitted
therefore
thou
rascal
says
he
i
ask
why
thou
didst
not
write
on
paper
oh
i
answered
him
we
had
none
in
the
wood
the
governor
asked
where
in
what
wood
and
again
i
paid
him
in
my
old
coin
and
said
i
did
not
know
then
the
governor
turned
to
some
of
his
officers
that
waited
on
him
and
said
either
this
is
an
or
else
a
fool
and
a
fool
he
can
not
be
that
can
write
so
well
and
as
he
spake
he
turned
over
the
leaves
to
shew
them
my
fine
handwriting
and
that
so
sharply
that
the
hermit
letter
fell
out
and
this
he
had
picked
up
while
i
turned
pale
for
that
i
held
for
my
chiefest
treasure
and
holy
relic
that
the
governor
noted
and
conceived
yet
greater
suspicion
of
treason
specially
when
he
had
opened
and
read
the
letter
for
says
he
i
surely
know
this
hand
and
know
that
it
is
written
by
an
officer
well
known
to
me
yet
can
i
not
remember
by
whom
also
the
contents
seemed
to
him
strange
and
not
to
be
understood
for
he
said
this
is
without
doubt
a
concerted
language
which
none
other
can
understand
save
him
to
whom
it
is
imparted
then
asking
me
my
name
when
i
said
simplicissimus
yes
yes
says
he
thou
art
one
of
the
right
kidney
away
away
put
him
at
once
in
irons
hand
and
foot
so
the
two
soldiers
marched
off
with
me
to
my
bespoken
lodging
namely
the
and
handed
me
over
to
the
gaoler
which
in
accordance
with
his
orders
adorned
me
with
iron
bands
and
chains
on
hands
and
feet
as
if
i
had
not
had
enough
to
carry
with
those
that
i
had
already
bound
round
my
body
nor
was
this
way
of
welcoming
me
enough
for
the
world
but
there
must
come
hangmen
and
their
satellites
with
horrible
instruments
of
torture
which
made
my
wretched
plight
truly
grievous
though
i
could
comfort
myself
with
my
innocence
o
god
says
i
to
myself
how
am
i
rightly
served
to
this
end
did
simplicissimus
run
from
the
service
of
god
into
the
world
that
such
a
misbirth
of
christianity
should
receive
the
just
reward
which
he
hath
deserved
for
his
wantonness
o
thou
unhappy
simplicissimus
whither
hath
thine
ingratitude
led
thee
lo
god
hath
hardly
brought
thee
to
the
knowledge
of
him
and
into
his
service
when
thou
contrariwise
must
run
off
from
his
employ
and
turn
thy
back
on
him
couldest
thou
not
go
on
eating
of
acorns
and
beans
as
before
and
so
serving
thy
creator
didst
thou
not
know
that
thy
faithful
hermit
and
teacher
had
fled
from
the
world
and
chosen
the
wilderness
o
stupid
stock
thou
didst
leave
it
in
the
hope
to
satisfy
thy
loose
desire
to
see
the
world
and
behold
while
thou
thinkest
to
feed
thine
eyes
thou
must
in
this
maze
of
dangers
perish
and
be
destroyed
couldst
thou
not
unwise
creature
understand
before
this
that
thy
teacher
would
never
have
left
the
world
for
that
hard
life
which
he
led
in
the
desert
if
he
had
hoped
to
find
in
the
world
true
peace
and
real
rest
and
eternal
salvation
o
poor
simplicissimus
go
thy
way
and
receive
the
reward
of
the
idle
thoughts
thou
hast
cherished
and
thy
presumptuous
folly
thou
hast
no
wrong
to
complain
of
neither
any
innocence
to
comfort
thee
with
for
thou
hast
hastened
to
meet
thine
own
torment
and
the
death
to
follow
thereafter
so
i
bewailed
myself
and
besought
god
for
forgiveness
and
commended
my
soul
to
him
in
the
meanwhile
we
drew
near
to
the
prison
and
when
my
need
was
greatest
then
was
god
help
nearest
for
as
i
was
surrounded
by
the
hangman
mates
and
stood
there
before
the
gaol
with
a
great
multitude
of
folk
to
wait
till
it
was
opened
and
i
could
be
thrust
in
lo
my
good
pastor
whose
village
had
so
lately
been
plundered
and
burned
must
also
see
what
was
toward
himself
being
also
under
arrest
so
as
he
looked
out
of
window
and
saw
me
he
cried
loudly
o
simplicissimus
is
it
thou
when
this
i
heard
and
saw
i
could
not
help
myself
but
must
lift
up
both
hands
to
him
and
cry
o
father
father
father
so
he
asked
what
had
i
done
i
answered
i
knew
not
they
had
brought
me
there
of
a
certainty
because
i
had
deserted
from
the
forest
but
when
he
learned
from
the
bystanders
that
they
took
me
for
a
spy
he
begged
they
would
make
a
stay
with
me
till
he
had
explained
my
case
to
the
lord
governor
for
that
would
be
of
use
for
my
deliverance
and
for
his
and
so
would
hinder
the
governor
from
dealing
wrongfully
with
both
of
us
since
he
knew
me
better
than
could
any
man
how
treacherous
dame
fortune
cast
on
simplicissimus
a
friendly
glance
so
was
allowed
him
to
go
to
the
governor
and
a
thereafter
i
was
fetched
out
likewise
and
put
in
the
servitors
room
where
were
already
two
tailors
a
shoemaker
with
shoes
a
haberdasher
with
stockings
and
hats
and
another
with
all
manner
of
apparel
so
that
i
might
forthwith
be
clothed
then
took
they
off
my
coat
chains
and
all
and
the
by
which
the
tailors
could
take
their
measure
aright
next
appeared
a
barber
with
his
lather
and
his
soaps
but
even
as
he
would
exercise
his
art
upon
me
came
another
order
which
did
grievously
terrify
me
for
it
ran
i
should
put
on
my
old
clothes
again
yet
was
not
so
ill
meant
as
i
feared
for
there
came
presently
a
painter
with
all
his
colours
namely
vermilion
and
cinnabar
for
my
eyelids
indigo
and
ultramarine
for
my
coral
lips
gamboge
and
ochre
and
yellow
lead
for
my
white
teeth
which
i
was
licking
for
sheer
hunger
and
and
burnt
umber
for
my
golden
hair
white
lead
for
my
terrible
eyes
and
every
kind
of
paint
for
my
coat
also
had
he
a
whole
handful
of
brushes
this
fellow
began
to
gaze
upon
me
to
take
a
sketch
to
lay
in
a
background
and
to
hang
his
head
on
one
side
the
better
to
compare
his
work
exactly
with
my
figure
now
he
changed
the
eyes
now
the
hair
presently
the
nostrils
and
in
a
word
all
he
had
not
at
first
done
aright
till
at
length
he
had
executed
a
model
true
to
nature
for
a
model
simplicissimus
was
and
not
till
then
might
the
barber
whisk
his
razor
over
me
who
twitched
my
head
this
way
and
that
and
spent
full
an
hour
and
a
half
over
my
hair
and
thereafter
trimmed
it
in
the
fashion
of
that
day
for
i
had
hair
enough
and
to
spare
after
that
he
brought
me
to
a
bathroom
and
cleansed
my
thin
starved
body
from
more
than
three
or
four
dirt
and
scarce
was
he
ended
when
they
brought
me
a
white
shirt
shoes
and
stockings
together
with
a
ruff
or
collar
and
hat
and
feather
likewise
the
breeches
were
finely
made
and
trimmed
with
gold
lace
so
all
that
was
wanted
was
the
cloak
and
upon
that
the
tailors
were
at
work
with
all
haste
then
came
the
cook
with
a
strong
broth
and
the
maid
with
a
cup
of
drink
and
there
sat
my
lord
simplicissimus
like
a
young
count
in
the
best
of
tempers
and
i
ate
heartily
though
i
knew
not
what
they
would
do
with
me
for
as
yet
i
had
never
heard
of
the
condemned
man
supper
and
therefore
the
partaking
of
this
glorious
first
meal
was
to
me
so
pleasant
and
sweet
that
i
can
not
sufficiently
express
declare
and
boast
of
it
to
mankind
yea
hardly
do
i
believe
i
ever
tasted
greater
pleasure
in
my
life
than
then
so
when
the
cloak
was
ready
i
put
it
on
and
in
this
new
apparel
shewed
such
an
awkward
figure
that
it
might
seem
one
had
dressed
up
a
for
the
tailors
had
been
ordered
of
intent
to
make
the
clothes
too
big
for
me
in
the
hope
i
should
presently
put
more
flesh
on
which
considering
the
excellence
of
my
feeding
seemed
like
to
happen
but
my
forest
dress
together
with
the
chains
and
all
appurtenances
were
conveyed
away
to
the
museum
there
to
be
added
to
other
rare
objects
and
antiquities
and
my
portrait
of
life
size
was
set
hard
by
so
after
his
supper
his
lordship
myself
was
put
to
bed
in
such
a
bed
as
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
in
my
dad
house
or
while
i
dwelt
with
my
hermit
yet
did
my
belly
so
growl
and
grumble
the
whole
night
through
that
i
could
not
sleep
perchance
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
knew
not
yet
what
was
good
or
because
it
wondered
at
the
delightful
new
foods
which
had
been
given
to
it
but
for
me
i
lay
there
quiet
until
the
sweet
sun
shone
bright
again
for
was
cold
and
reflected
what
strange
adventures
i
had
passed
through
in
a
few
days
and
how
god
my
father
had
so
truly
helped
me
and
brought
me
into
so
goodly
an
heritage
who
the
hermit
was
by
whom
simplicissimus
was
cherished
the
same
morning
the
governor
chamberlain
commanded
me
i
should
go
to
the
pastor
and
there
learn
what
his
lordship
had
said
to
him
in
my
affair
likewise
he
sent
an
orderly
to
bring
me
to
him
then
the
pastor
took
me
into
his
library
and
there
he
sat
down
and
bade
me
also
sit
down
and
says
he
my
good
simplicissimus
that
same
hermit
with
whom
thou
didst
dwell
in
the
wood
was
not
only
the
lord
governor
but
also
his
staunch
supporter
in
war
and
his
chiefest
friend
as
it
pleased
the
governor
to
tell
me
the
same
from
his
youth
up
had
never
failed
either
in
the
bravery
of
an
heroical
soldier
nor
in
that
godliness
and
piety
which
became
the
holiest
of
men
which
two
virtues
it
is
not
usual
to
find
united
yet
his
spiritual
mind
coupled
with
adverse
circumstances
so
checked
the
course
of
his
earthly
happiness
that
he
rejected
his
nobility
and
resigned
certain
fine
estates
in
scotland
where
he
was
born
and
despised
such
because
all
worldly
affairs
now
seemed
to
him
vain
foolish
and
contemptible
in
a
word
he
hoped
to
exchange
his
earthly
eminence
for
a
better
glory
to
come
for
his
noble
spirit
had
a
disgust
at
all
temporal
display
and
all
his
thoughts
and
desires
were
set
on
that
poor
miserable
life
wherein
thou
didst
find
him
in
the
forest
and
wherein
thou
didst
bear
him
company
till
his
death
and
in
my
opinion
said
the
pastor
he
had
been
seduced
thereto
by
his
reading
of
many
popish
books
concerning
the
lives
of
the
ancient
eremites
yet
will
i
not
conceal
from
thee
how
he
came
into
the
spessart
and
in
accord
with
his
wish
into
such
a
miserable
hermit
life
that
thou
mayest
hereafter
be
able
to
tell
others
thereof
for
the
second
night
after
that
bloody
battle
of
höchst
was
lost
he
came
alone
and
unattended
to
my
even
as
i
my
wife
and
children
were
fallen
asleep
and
that
towards
morning
for
because
of
the
noise
all
over
the
country
which
both
pursuers
and
pursued
are
wont
to
make
in
such
cases
we
had
been
awake
all
the
night
before
and
half
of
this
present
one
at
first
he
knocked
gently
and
then
sharply
enough
till
he
wakened
me
and
my
folk
and
when
i
at
his
request
and
after
short
exchange
of
words
which
was
on
both
sides
full
cautious
had
opened
the
door
i
saw
the
cavalier
dismount
from
his
mettlesome
steed
his
costly
clothing
was
as
thickly
sprinkled
with
the
blood
of
his
enemies
as
it
was
decked
with
gold
and
silver
and
inasmuch
as
he
still
held
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
fear
and
terror
came
upon
me
yet
when
he
sheathed
his
sword
and
shewed
nothing
but
courtesy
i
must
wonder
that
so
noble
a
gentleman
should
so
humbly
beg
a
poor
village
pastor
for
shelter
and
by
reason
of
his
handsome
person
and
his
noble
carriage
i
addressed
myself
to
him
as
to
the
count
of
mansfield
himself
but
said
he
he
could
for
this
once
be
not
only
compared
to
the
count
of
mansfield
in
respect
of
ill
fortune
but
even
preferred
before
him
three
things
did
he
lament
first
the
loss
of
his
lady
and
her
near
her
delivery
and
then
the
loss
of
his
battle
and
last
of
all
that
he
had
not
had
the
luck
to
die
therein
as
did
other
honest
soldiers
for
the
evangelical
cause
then
would
i
comfort
him
but
saw
that
his
noble
heart
needed
no
comfort
so
i
set
before
him
what
the
house
afforded
and
bade
them
make
for
him
a
soldier
bed
of
clean
straw
for
in
no
other
would
he
lie
though
much
he
needed
rest
the
next
morning
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
give
me
his
horse
and
his
money
of
which
he
had
with
him
no
mean
sum
in
gold
and
did
share
divers
costly
rings
among
my
wife
children
and
servants
this
could
i
not
understand
in
him
seeing
that
soldiers
be
wont
far
rather
to
take
than
to
give
and
therefore
i
had
doubts
whether
to
receive
so
great
presents
and
gave
as
a
pretext
that
i
had
not
deserved
so
much
from
him
nor
could
again
repay
him
besides
said
i
if
folk
saw
such
riches
and
specially
the
splendid
horse
which
could
not
be
hid
in
my
possession
many
would
conclude
i
had
robbed
or
murdered
him
but
he
said
i
should
live
without
care
on
that
score
for
he
would
protect
me
from
such
danger
with
his
own
handwriting
yea
and
he
would
desire
to
carry
away
out
of
my
parsonage
not
even
his
shirt
let
alone
his
clothes
and
therewith
he
opened
his
design
to
become
a
hermit
i
fought
against
that
with
might
and
main
for
methought
such
a
plan
smacked
of
popery
reminding
him
that
he
could
serve
the
gospel
more
with
his
sword
but
in
vain
for
he
argued
so
long
and
stoutly
with
me
that
at
last
i
gave
in
and
provided
him
with
those
books
pictures
and
furniture
which
thou
didst
find
in
his
hut
yet
would
he
take
nothing
in
return
for
all
that
he
had
presented
to
me
save
only
the
coverlet
of
wool
under
which
he
had
slept
on
the
straw
that
night
and
out
of
that
he
had
a
coat
made
and
my
wagon
chains
those
which
he
always
wore
must
i
exchange
with
him
for
a
golden
one
whereon
he
wore
his
portrait
so
that
he
kept
for
himself
neither
money
nor
money
worth
then
my
servant
led
him
to
the
wildest
part
of
the
wood
and
there
helped
him
to
build
his
hut
and
in
what
manner
he
there
spent
his
life
and
with
what
help
at
times
i
did
assist
him
thou
knowest
as
well
as
i
yea
in
part
better
now
when
lately
the
battle
of
nördlingen
was
lost
and
i
as
thou
knowest
was
clean
stripped
of
all
and
also
evilly
handled
i
fled
hither
for
safety
besides
i
had
here
my
chief
possessions
and
when
my
ready
money
was
about
to
fail
me
i
took
three
rings
and
the
chain
together
with
the
portrait
that
i
had
from
the
hermit
among
which
was
his
and
took
them
to
a
jew
to
turn
them
into
money
but
he
on
account
of
their
value
and
fine
workmanship
took
them
to
the
governor
to
sell
who
forthwith
knew
the
arms
and
portrait
and
sent
for
me
and
asked
where
i
had
gotten
such
treasures
so
i
told
him
the
truth
and
shewed
him
the
handwriting
or
deed
of
gift
and
narrated
to
him
all
his
story
also
how
he
had
lived
and
died
in
the
wood
such
a
tale
he
could
not
believe
but
put
me
under
arrest
till
he
could
better
learn
the
truth
and
while
he
was
at
work
sending
out
a
party
to
take
a
survey
of
the
dwelling
and
to
fetch
thee
hither
here
i
beheld
thee
brought
to
the
tower
now
seeing
that
the
governor
hath
no
longer
cause
to
doubt
of
my
story
and
seeing
that
i
can
call
to
witness
the
place
where
the
hermit
dwelt
and
likewise
thee
and
other
living
deponents
and
most
of
all
my
sexton
which
so
often
admitted
thee
and
him
to
the
church
before
day
and
specially
since
the
letter
which
he
found
in
thy
book
of
prayer
doth
afford
an
excellent
testimony
not
only
of
the
truth
but
of
the
late
hermit
holiness
therefore
he
will
shew
favour
to
me
and
thee
for
the
sake
of
his
dear
departed
and
now
hast
thou
only
to
decide
what
thou
wouldest
he
should
do
for
thee
an
thou
wilt
study
he
pays
the
cost
desirest
thou
to
learn
a
trade
he
will
have
thee
taught
one
but
if
thou
wilt
stay
with
him
he
will
hold
thee
as
his
own
child
for
he
said
if
even
a
dog
came
to
him
from
his
departed
he
would
cherish
it
so
i
answered
was
all
one
to
me
what
the
lord
governor
would
do
with
me
how
simplicissimus
became
a
page
and
likewise
how
the
hermit
wife
was
lost
now
did
the
pastor
keep
me
at
his
lodging
till
ten
of
the
clock
before
he
would
go
with
me
to
the
governor
to
tell
him
of
my
resolve
for
so
could
he
be
his
guest
at
dinner
for
the
governor
kept
open
house
is
true
hanau
was
then
blockaded
and
with
the
common
folk
times
were
so
hard
especially
with
them
that
had
fled
for
refuge
to
the
fortress
that
some
who
seemed
to
themselves
to
be
somewhat
were
not
ashamed
to
pick
up
the
frozen
in
the
streets
which
the
rich
had
cast
away
and
my
pastor
was
so
lucky
that
he
got
to
sit
by
the
governor
at
the
head
of
the
table
while
i
waited
on
them
with
a
plate
in
my
hand
as
the
chamberlain
taught
me
to
which
business
i
was
as
well
fitted
as
an
ass
to
play
chess
yet
my
pastor
made
good
with
his
tongue
what
the
awkwardness
of
my
person
failed
in
for
he
said
i
had
been
reared
in
the
wilderness
and
had
never
dwelt
among
men
and
therefore
must
be
excused
because
i
could
not
yet
know
how
to
carry
myself
yet
the
faithfulness
i
had
shewn
to
the
hermit
and
the
hard
life
i
had
endured
with
him
were
wonderful
and
that
alone
deserved
that
folk
should
not
only
have
patience
with
my
awkwardness
but
should
even
put
me
before
the
finest
young
nobleman
furthermore
he
related
how
the
hermit
had
found
all
his
joy
in
me
because
as
he
often
said
i
was
so
like
in
face
to
his
dear
lady
and
that
he
had
often
marvelled
at
my
steadfastness
and
unchangeable
will
to
remain
with
him
as
also
at
many
other
virtues
which
he
praised
in
me
lastly
he
could
not
enough
declare
with
what
earnest
fervency
the
hermit
had
just
before
his
death
commended
me
to
him
the
pastor
and
had
confessed
he
loved
me
as
his
own
child
this
tickled
my
ears
so
much
that
methought
i
had
already
received
satisfaction
enough
for
all
i
had
endured
with
the
hermit
then
the
governor
asked
did
not
his
late
know
he
was
commandant
of
hanau
yea
truly
answered
the
pastor
for
i
told
him
myself
but
he
listened
as
coldly
yet
with
a
joyful
face
and
a
gentle
smile
as
he
had
never
known
any
ramsay
so
that
even
now
when
i
think
thereupon
i
must
wonder
at
this
man
resolution
and
firm
purpose
that
he
could
bring
his
heart
to
this
not
only
to
renounce
the
world
but
even
to
put
out
of
his
mind
his
best
friend
when
he
had
him
close
at
hand
then
were
the
governor
eyes
full
of
tears
who
yet
had
no
soft
woman
heart
but
was
a
brave
and
heroical
soldier
and
says
he
had
i
known
he
was
yet
alive
and
where
he
was
to
be
found
i
would
have
had
him
fetched
even
against
his
will
that
i
might
repay
his
kindnesses
but
since
fortune
hath
denied
me
that
i
will
in
his
place
cherish
his
simplicissimus
and
ah
says
he
again
the
good
cavalier
had
cause
enough
to
lament
his
wife
great
with
child
as
she
was
for
in
the
pursuit
she
was
captured
by
a
party
of
imperialist
troopers
and
that
too
in
the
spessart
which
when
i
heard
and
knew
not
but
that
my
was
slain
at
höchst
at
once
i
sent
a
trumpeter
to
the
enemy
to
ask
for
my
sister
and
ransom
her
yet
got
no
more
thereby
than
to
learn
the
said
party
of
troopers
had
been
scattered
in
the
spessart
by
a
few
peasants
and
that
in
that
fight
my
sister
had
again
been
lost
to
them
so
that
to
this
hour
i
know
not
what
became
of
her
this
and
the
like
made
up
the
of
the
governor
and
the
pastor
regarding
my
hermit
and
his
which
pair
were
the
more
pitied
because
they
had
enjoyed
each
other
love
but
a
year
but
as
to
me
i
became
the
governor
page
and
so
fine
a
fellow
that
the
people
specially
the
peasants
when
i
must
announce
them
to
my
master
called
me
the
young
lord
already
though
indeed
one
seldom
sees
a
youngster
that
hath
been
a
lord
but
oftentimes
lords
that
have
been
youngsters
how
simplicissimus
blamed
the
world
and
saw
many
idols
therein
now
at
that
time
i
had
no
precious
possession
save
only
a
clear
conscience
and
a
right
pious
mind
and
that
clad
and
surrounded
with
the
purest
innocence
and
simplicity
of
vice
i
knew
no
more
than
that
i
had
at
times
heard
it
spoken
of
or
read
of
it
and
if
i
saw
any
man
commit
such
sin
then
was
it
to
me
a
fearful
and
a
terrible
thing
i
being
so
brought
up
and
reared
as
to
have
the
presence
of
god
ever
before
my
eyes
and
most
earnestly
to
live
according
to
his
holy
will
and
inasmuch
as
i
knew
all
this
i
could
not
but
compare
men
ways
and
works
with
that
same
will
and
methought
i
saw
naught
but
vileness
lord
god
how
did
i
wonder
at
the
first
when
i
considered
the
law
and
the
gospel
and
the
faithful
warnings
of
christ
and
saw
on
the
contrary
part
the
deeds
of
them
that
gave
themselves
out
to
be
his
disciples
and
followers
in
place
of
the
straightforward
dealing
which
every
true
christian
should
have
i
found
mere
hypocrisy
and
besides
such
numberless
follies
among
all
dwellers
in
the
world
that
i
must
needs
doubt
whether
i
saw
before
me
christians
or
not
for
though
i
could
see
well
that
many
had
a
serious
knowledge
of
god
will
yet
could
i
mark
but
little
serious
purpose
to
fulfil
the
same
so
had
i
a
thousand
puzzles
and
strange
thoughts
in
my
mind
and
fell
into
grievous
difficulty
upon
that
saying
of
christ
which
saith
judge
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
nevertheless
there
came
into
my
mind
the
words
of
paul
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
galatians
where
he
saith
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
manifest
which
are
these
adultery
fornication
uncleanness
lasciviousness
and
so
on
of
the
which
i
tell
you
before
as
i
have
also
told
you
in
time
past
that
they
which
do
such
things
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
then
i
thought
every
man
doeth
all
these
things
openly
wherefore
then
should
i
not
in
this
matter
conclude
from
the
apostle
word
that
there
shall
be
few
that
are
saved
moreover
pride
and
greed
with
their
worthy
accompaniments
gorging
and
swilling
and
loose
living
were
a
daily
occupation
for
them
of
substance
yet
what
did
seem
to
me
most
terrible
of
all
was
this
shameful
thing
that
some
and
specially
soldiers
in
whose
case
vice
is
not
wont
to
be
severely
punished
should
make
of
both
these
things
their
own
godlessness
and
god
holy
will
a
mere
jest
for
example
i
heard
once
an
adulterer
which
after
his
deed
of
shame
accomplished
would
treat
thereof
and
spake
these
godless
words
it
serves
the
cowardly
cuckold
aright
says
he
to
get
a
pair
of
horns
from
me
and
if
i
confess
the
truth
i
did
the
thing
more
to
vex
the
husband
than
to
please
the
wife
and
so
to
be
revenged
on
them
o
pitiful
revenge
says
one
honest
heart
that
stood
by
by
which
a
man
staineth
his
own
conscience
and
gaineth
the
shameful
name
of
adulterer
and
fornicator
what
fornicator
answered
he
with
a
scornful
laughter
i
am
no
fornicator
because
i
have
given
this
marriage
a
twist
a
fornicator
is
he
that
the
sixth
commandment
speaks
of
where
it
forbids
that
any
man
get
into
another
garden
and
nick
the
fruit
before
the
owner
how
to
prove
that
this
was
so
to
be
understood
he
forthwith
explained
according
to
his
devil
catechism
the
seventh
commandment
wherein
it
is
said
thou
shalt
not
steal
and
of
such
words
he
used
many
so
that
i
sighed
within
myself
and
thought
o
sinner
thou
callest
thyself
a
and
so
then
god
must
be
a
seeing
that
he
doth
separate
man
and
wife
by
death
and
out
of
mine
overflowing
zeal
and
anger
i
said
to
him
officer
though
he
was
thinkest
thou
not
thou
sinnest
more
with
these
godless
words
than
by
thine
act
of
adultery
so
he
answered
me
thou
rascal
must
i
give
thee
a
buffet
or
two
yea
and
i
believe
i
had
received
a
handsome
couple
of
such
if
the
fellow
had
not
stood
in
fear
of
my
lord
so
i
held
my
peace
and
thereafter
i
marked
it
was
no
rare
case
for
single
folk
to
cast
eyes
upon
wedded
folk
and
wedded
folk
upon
such
as
were
unwedded
now
while
i
was
yet
studying
under
my
good
hermit
care
the
way
to
eternal
life
i
much
wondered
why
god
had
so
straitly
forbidden
idolatry
to
his
people
for
i
imagined
if
any
one
had
ever
known
the
true
and
eternal
god
he
would
never
again
honour
and
pray
to
any
other
and
so
in
my
stupid
mind
i
resolved
that
this
commandment
was
unnecessary
and
vain
but
ah
fool
as
i
was
i
knew
not
what
i
thought
i
knew
for
no
sooner
was
i
come
into
the
great
world
than
i
marked
how
in
spite
of
this
commandment
wellnigh
every
man
had
his
special
idol
yet
some
had
more
than
the
old
and
new
heathen
themselves
some
had
their
god
in
their
upon
which
they
put
all
their
trust
and
confidence
many
a
one
had
his
idol
at
court
and
trusted
wholly
and
entirely
on
him
which
idol
was
but
a
minion
and
often
even
such
a
pitiable
lickspittle
as
his
worshipper
himself
for
his
airy
godhead
depended
only
on
the
april
weather
of
a
prince
smile
others
found
their
idol
in
popularity
and
fancied
if
they
could
but
attain
to
that
they
would
themselves
be
yet
others
had
their
gods
in
their
head
namely
those
to
whom
the
true
god
had
granted
a
sound
brain
so
that
they
were
able
to
learn
certain
arts
and
sciences
for
these
forgot
the
great
giver
and
looked
only
to
the
gift
in
the
hope
that
gift
would
procure
them
all
prosperity
yea
and
there
were
many
whose
god
was
but
their
own
belly
to
which
they
daily
offered
sacrifice
as
once
the
heathen
did
to
bacchus
and
ceres
and
when
that
god
shewed
himself
unkind
or
when
human
failings
shewed
themselves
in
him
these
miserable
folk
then
made
a
god
of
their
physician
and
sought
for
their
life
prolongation
in
the
apothecary
shop
wherefrom
they
were
more
often
sped
on
their
way
to
death
and
many
fools
made
goddesses
for
themselves
out
of
flattering
harlots
these
they
called
by
all
manner
of
outlandish
names
worshipped
them
day
and
night
with
many
thousand
sighs
and
made
songs
upon
them
which
contained
naught
but
praise
of
them
together
with
a
humble
prayer
they
would
have
mercy
upon
their
folly
and
become
as
great
fools
as
were
their
suitors
contrariwise
were
there
women
which
had
made
their
own
beauty
their
idol
for
this
they
thought
will
give
me
my
livelihood
let
god
in
heaven
say
what
he
will
and
this
idol
was
every
day
in
place
of
other
offerings
adorned
and
sustained
with
paint
ointments
waters
powders
and
the
like
daubs
there
too
i
saw
some
which
held
houses
luckily
situated
as
their
gods
for
they
said
so
long
as
they
had
lived
therein
had
they
ever
had
health
and
wealth
and
many
said
these
had
tumbled
in
through
their
windows
at
this
folly
i
did
more
especially
wonder
because
i
would
well
perceive
the
reason
why
the
inhabitants
so
prospered
i
knew
one
man
who
for
some
years
could
never
sleep
by
reason
of
his
trade
in
tobacco
for
to
this
he
had
given
up
his
heart
mind
and
soul
which
should
be
dedicate
to
god
alone
and
to
this
idol
he
sent
up
night
and
day
a
thousand
sighs
for
was
by
that
he
made
his
way
in
life
yet
what
did
happen
the
fool
died
and
vanished
like
his
own
then
thought
i
o
thou
miserable
man
had
but
thy
soul
happiness
and
the
honour
of
the
true
god
been
so
dear
to
thee
as
thine
idol
which
stands
upon
thy
in
the
shape
of
a
brazilian
with
a
roll
of
tobacco
under
his
arm
and
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
then
am
i
sure
and
certain
that
thou
hadst
won
a
noble
crown
of
honour
to
wear
in
the
next
world
another
ass
had
yet
more
pitiful
idols
for
when
in
a
great
company
it
was
being
told
by
each
how
he
had
been
fed
and
sustained
during
the
great
famine
and
scarcity
of
food
this
fellow
said
in
plain
german
the
snails
and
frogs
had
been
his
gods
for
want
of
them
he
must
have
died
of
hunger
so
i
asked
him
what
then
had
god
himself
been
to
him
who
had
provided
such
insects
for
his
sustenance
the
poor
creature
could
answer
nothing
and
i
wondered
the
more
because
i
had
never
read
that
either
the
old
idolatrous
egyptians
or
the
new
american
savages
ever
called
such
vermin
their
gods
as
did
this
prater
i
once
went
with
a
person
of
quality
into
his
museum
wherein
were
fine
curiosities
but
among
all
none
pleased
me
better
than
an
ecce
homo
by
reason
of
its
moving
portraiture
by
which
it
stirred
the
spectator
at
once
to
sympathy
by
it
there
hung
a
paper
picture
painted
in
china
whereon
were
chinese
idols
sitting
in
their
majesty
and
some
in
shape
like
devils
so
the
master
of
the
house
asked
me
which
piece
in
this
gallery
pleased
me
most
and
when
i
pointed
to
the
said
ecce
homo
he
said
i
was
wrong
for
the
chinese
picture
was
rarer
and
therefore
of
more
value
he
would
not
lose
it
for
a
dozen
such
ecce
homos
so
said
i
sir
is
your
heart
like
to
your
speech
surely
said
he
why
then
said
i
your
heart
god
is
that
one
whose
picture
you
do
confess
with
your
mouth
to
be
of
most
value
fool
says
he
is
the
rarity
i
esteem
whereto
i
replied
yet
what
can
be
rarer
and
more
worthy
of
wonder
than
that
god
son
himself
suffered
in
the
way
which
this
picture
doth
declare
how
simplicissimus
found
the
world
all
strange
and
the
world
found
him
strange
likewise
even
as
much
as
these
and
yet
a
greater
number
of
idols
were
worshipped
so
much
on
the
contrary
was
the
majesty
of
the
true
god
despised
for
as
i
never
saw
any
desirous
to
keep
his
word
and
command
so
i
saw
contrariwise
many
that
resisted
him
in
all
things
and
excelled
even
the
publicans
in
wickedness
which
publicans
were
in
the
days
when
christ
walked
upon
earth
open
sinners
and
so
saith
christ
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
if
ye
do
good
only
to
your
brethren
what
do
ye
that
the
publicans
do
not
but
i
found
not
only
no
one
that
would
follow
this
command
of
christ
but
every
man
did
the
clean
opposite
the
more
a
man
hath
kindred
the
more
a
man
is
hindered
was
the
word
and
nowhere
did
i
find
more
envy
hatred
malice
quarrel
and
dispute
than
between
brothers
sisters
and
other
born
friends
specially
if
an
inheritance
fell
to
them
moreover
the
handicraftsmen
of
every
place
hated
one
another
so
that
i
could
plainly
see
and
must
conclude
that
in
comparison
the
open
sinners
publicans
and
which
by
reason
of
their
evil
deeds
were
hated
by
many
were
far
better
than
we
christians
nowadays
in
exercise
of
brotherly
love
seeing
that
christ
bears
testimony
to
them
that
at
least
they
did
love
one
another
then
thought
i
if
we
have
no
reward
because
we
love
our
enemies
how
great
must
our
punishment
be
if
we
hate
our
friends
and
where
there
should
be
the
greatest
love
and
good
faith
there
i
found
the
worst
treachery
and
the
strongest
hatred
for
many
a
lord
would
fleece
his
true
servants
and
subjects
and
some
retainers
would
play
the
rogue
against
the
best
of
lords
so
too
between
married
folk
i
marked
continual
strife
many
a
tyrant
treated
his
wedded
wife
worse
than
his
dog
and
many
a
loose
baggage
held
her
good
husband
but
for
a
fool
and
an
ass
so
too
many
currish
lords
and
masters
cheated
their
industrious
servants
of
their
due
pay
and
pinched
them
both
in
food
and
drink
and
contrariwise
i
saw
many
faithless
servitors
which
by
theft
or
neglect
brought
their
kind
masters
to
ruin
tradesfolk
and
craftsmen
did
vie
with
each
other
in
jewish
roguery
exacted
usury
sucked
the
sweat
of
the
poor
peasant
brow
by
all
manner
of
chicanery
and
on
the
other
hand
there
were
peasants
so
godless
that
if
they
were
not
thoroughly
well
and
cruelly
fleeced
they
would
sneer
at
other
folks
or
even
their
lords
themselves
for
their
simplicity
once
did
i
see
a
soldier
give
another
a
sore
buffet
and
i
conceived
he
that
was
smitten
would
turn
the
other
cheek
for
as
yet
i
had
been
in
no
quarrel
but
there
was
i
wrong
for
the
insulted
one
drew
on
him
and
dealt
the
offender
a
crack
of
the
crown
so
i
cried
at
the
top
of
my
voice
ah
friend
what
dost
thou
a
coward
must
he
be
says
he
that
would
not
avenge
himself
devil
take
me
but
i
will
or
i
care
not
to
live
what
he
must
be
a
knave
that
would
let
himself
be
so
fobbed
off
and
between
these
two
antagonists
the
quarrel
waxed
greater
for
their
backers
on
both
sides
together
with
the
bystanders
and
any
man
moreover
that
came
by
chance
to
the
spot
were
presently
by
the
ears
and
there
i
heard
men
swear
by
god
and
their
own
souls
so
lightly
that
i
could
not
believe
they
held
those
souls
for
their
dearest
treasure
but
all
this
was
but
child
play
for
they
stayed
not
at
such
children
curses
but
presently
was
so
thunder
lightning
hail
strike
me
tear
me
devil
take
me
and
the
like
and
not
one
thunder
or
lightning
but
a
hundred
thousand
and
snatch
me
away
into
the
air
yea
and
the
blessed
sacraments
for
them
must
have
been
not
seven
but
a
hundred
thousand
and
there
with
so
many
bloodies
dammes
and
cursemes
that
my
poor
hair
stood
on
end
thereat
then
thought
i
of
christ
command
wherein
he
saith
swear
not
let
your
speech
be
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
for
whatsoever
is
more
is
evil
now
all
this
that
i
saw
and
heard
i
pondered
in
my
heart
and
at
the
last
i
firmly
concluded
these
bullies
were
no
christians
at
all
and
therefore
i
sought
for
other
company
and
worst
of
all
it
did
terrify
me
when
i
heard
some
such
swaggerers
boast
of
their
wickedness
sin
shame
and
vice
for
again
and
again
i
heard
them
so
do
yea
day
by
day
and
thus
they
would
say
blood
man
but
we
were
foxed
yesterday
three
times
in
the
day
was
i
blind
drunk
and
three
times
did
vomit
all
my
stars
says
another
how
did
we
torment
the
rascal
peasants
and
hundred
thousand
devils
says
a
third
what
sport
did
we
have
with
the
women
and
maids
and
so
on
i
cut
him
down
as
if
lightning
had
struck
him
i
shot
him
shot
him
so
that
he
shewed
the
whites
of
his
eyes
or
again
i
rode
him
down
so
cleverly
the
devil
only
could
fetch
him
off
i
put
such
a
stone
in
his
way
that
he
must
needs
break
his
neck
thereover
such
and
heathen
talk
filled
my
ears
every
day
and
more
than
that
i
did
hear
and
see
sins
done
in
god
name
which
are
much
to
be
grieved
for
such
wickedness
was
specially
practised
by
the
soldiers
when
they
would
say
now
in
god
name
let
us
forth
on
a
foray
to
plunder
kidnap
shoot
down
cut
down
assault
capture
and
burn
and
all
the
rest
of
their
horrible
works
and
practices
just
as
the
usurers
ever
invoke
god
with
their
hypocritical
in
god
name
and
therewithal
let
their
devilish
avarice
loose
to
flay
and
to
strip
honest
folk
once
did
i
see
two
rogues
hanged
that
would
break
into
a
house
by
night
to
steal
and
even
as
they
had
placed
their
ladder
one
would
mount
it
saying
in
god
name
there
comes
the
householder
and
in
the
devil
name
says
he
also
and
therewithal
threw
him
down
where
he
broke
a
leg
and
so
was
captured
and
a
few
days
after
strung
up
together
with
his
comrade
but
i
if
i
saw
the
like
must
speak
out
and
out
would
i
come
with
some
passage
of
holy
writ
or
in
other
ways
would
warn
the
sinner
and
all
men
therefore
held
me
for
a
fool
yea
i
was
so
often
laughed
out
of
countenance
in
return
for
my
good
intent
that
at
length
i
took
a
disgust
at
it
and
preferred
altogether
to
keep
silence
which
yet
for
christian
love
i
could
not
keep
i
would
that
all
men
had
been
reared
with
my
hermit
believing
that
then
many
would
look
on
the
world
ways
with
simplicissimus
eyes
as
i
then
beheld
them
i
had
not
the
wit
to
see
that
if
there
were
only
simplicissimuses
in
the
world
then
there
were
not
so
many
vices
to
behold
meanwhile
certain
that
a
man
of
the
world
as
being
accustomed
to
all
vices
and
himself
partaker
thereof
can
not
in
the
least
understand
on
what
a
thorny
path
he
and
his
likes
do
walk
a
new
and
strange
way
for
men
to
wish
one
another
luck
and
to
welcome
one
another
having
now
as
i
deemed
reason
to
doubt
whether
i
were
among
christians
or
not
i
went
to
the
pastor
and
told
him
all
that
i
had
heard
and
seen
and
what
my
thoughts
were
namely
that
i
held
these
people
for
mockers
of
christ
and
his
word
and
no
christians
at
all
with
the
request
he
would
in
any
case
help
me
out
of
my
dream
that
i
might
know
what
i
should
count
my
fellow
men
to
be
the
pastor
answered
of
a
surety
they
be
christians
nor
would
i
counsel
thee
to
call
them
otherwise
o
god
said
i
how
can
that
be
for
if
i
point
out
to
one
or
the
other
his
sin
that
he
committeth
against
god
then
am
i
but
mocked
and
laughed
at
marvel
not
at
that
answered
the
pastor
i
believe
if
our
first
pious
christians
which
lived
in
the
time
of
christ
yea
if
the
apostles
themselves
should
now
rise
from
the
grave
and
come
into
the
world
that
they
would
put
the
like
question
and
in
the
end
like
thee
would
be
accounted
of
many
to
be
fools
yet
that
thou
hast
thus
far
seen
and
heard
is
but
an
ordinary
thing
and
mere
child
play
compared
with
that
which
elsewhere
secretly
and
openly
with
violence
against
god
and
man
doth
happen
and
is
perpetrated
in
the
world
let
not
that
vex
thee
thou
wilt
find
few
christians
such
as
was
the
late
master
samuel
now
even
as
we
spake
together
some
of
the
opposite
party
which
had
been
taken
prisoner
were
led
across
the
and
this
broke
up
our
discourse
for
we
too
must
go
to
look
on
the
captives
here
then
i
was
ware
of
a
folly
whereof
i
could
never
have
dreamed
and
that
was
a
new
fashion
of
greeting
and
welcoming
one
another
for
one
of
our
garrison
who
also
had
beforetime
served
the
emperor
knew
one
of
the
prisoners
so
he
goes
up
to
him
gives
him
his
hand
and
pressed
his
for
sheer
joy
and
heartiness
and
says
he
devil
take
thee
art
still
alive
brother
blood
is
surely
the
devil
that
brings
us
together
here
strike
me
blind
but
i
believed
thou
wert
long
since
hanged
then
answered
the
other
curse
me
but
is
it
thee
or
not
devil
take
thee
how
camest
thou
here
i
never
thought
in
all
my
born
days
i
should
meet
thee
again
but
thought
the
devil
had
fetched
thee
long
ago
and
when
they
parted
one
says
to
the
other
in
place
of
god
be
wi
you
gallows
luck
gallows
luck
will
we
meet
again
and
be
nobly
drunk
together
is
not
this
a
fine
pious
welcome
said
i
to
the
pastor
be
not
these
noble
christian
wishes
have
not
these
men
a
godly
intent
for
the
coming
day
who
could
know
them
for
christians
or
hearken
to
them
without
amazement
if
they
so
talk
with
one
another
for
christian
love
how
will
it
fare
if
they
do
quarrel
sir
pastor
if
these
be
flock
and
thou
their
appointed
shepherd
i
counsel
thee
to
lead
them
in
better
pastures
yea
answered
the
pastor
dear
child
is
ever
so
with
these
godless
soldiers
god
help
us
if
i
said
a
word
i
might
as
well
preach
to
the
deaf
and
should
gain
naught
from
it
but
the
perilous
hatred
of
these
godless
fellows
at
that
i
wondered
but
talked
yet
awhile
with
the
pastor
and
went
then
to
wait
upon
the
governor
for
at
times
had
i
leave
to
view
the
town
and
to
visit
the
pastor
for
my
lord
had
wind
of
my
simplicity
and
thought
such
would
cease
if
i
went
about
seeing
this
and
hearing
that
and
being
taught
by
others
or
as
folks
say
being
broken
to
harness
how
simplicissimus
discoursed
with
the
secretary
and
how
he
found
a
false
friend
now
my
lord
favour
towards
me
increased
daily
and
the
longer
the
greater
because
i
looked
more
and
more
like
not
only
to
his
sister
whom
the
hermit
had
had
to
wife
but
also
to
that
good
man
himself
as
good
food
and
idleness
made
me
sleeker
and
this
favour
i
enjoyed
in
many
quarters
for
whosoever
had
business
with
the
governor
shewed
me
favour
also
and
especially
my
lord
secretary
was
well
affected
to
me
and
as
he
must
teach
me
my
figures
he
often
found
pastime
in
my
simpleness
and
ignorance
he
was
but
now
fresh
from
the
university
and
therefore
was
of
the
jokes
of
the
schools
which
at
times
gave
him
the
appearance
of
being
a
button
short
or
a
button
too
many
often
would
he
convince
me
black
was
white
or
white
black
so
it
came
about
that
at
first
i
believed
him
in
everything
and
at
last
in
nothing
once
on
a
time
i
blamed
him
for
his
dirty
inkhorn
so
he
answered
was
the
best
piece
of
furniture
in
his
office
for
out
of
it
he
could
conjure
whatever
he
desired
his
fine
ducats
of
gold
his
fine
raiment
and
in
a
word
whatsoever
he
possessed
all
that
had
he
fished
out
of
his
inkhorn
then
would
i
not
believe
that
out
of
so
small
and
inconsiderable
a
thing
such
noble
possessions
were
to
be
had
so
he
answered
all
this
came
from
the
spiritus
papyri
for
so
did
he
name
his
inks
and
the
was
for
this
reason
named
an
because
it
held
matters
of
importance
then
i
asked
how
could
a
man
bring
them
out
since
one
could
scarce
put
a
couple
of
fingers
in
to
that
he
answered
he
had
an
arm
in
his
head
fit
to
do
such
business
yea
and
hoped
presently
to
fish
out
a
rich
and
handsome
wife
and
if
he
had
luck
he
trusted
also
to
bring
out
land
of
his
own
and
servants
of
his
own
as
in
earlier
times
would
surely
have
happened
at
these
tricks
of
craft
i
wondered
and
asked
if
other
folk
knew
such
arts
surely
says
he
all
chancellors
doctors
secretaries
proctors
or
advocates
commissaries
notaries
traders
and
merchants
and
numberless
others
besides
which
commonly
if
they
do
but
fish
diligently
in
it
become
rich
lords
thereby
then
said
i
in
this
wise
the
peasants
and
other
folk
have
no
wit
in
that
they
eat
their
bread
in
the
sweat
of
their
brow
and
do
not
also
learn
this
art
so
he
answered
some
know
not
the
worth
of
an
art
and
therefore
have
no
desire
to
learn
it
some
would
fain
learn
it
but
lack
that
arm
in
their
head
or
some
other
necessary
thing
some
learn
the
wit
and
have
the
arm
but
know
not
the
knack
which
the
art
requireth
if
a
man
will
be
rich
thereby
and
others
know
all
and
can
do
all
that
appertains
thereto
yet
they
dwell
on
the
unlucky
side
and
have
no
opportunity
like
me
to
exercise
this
art
properly
now
as
we
reasoned
in
this
fashion
of
the
which
of
a
truth
reminded
me
of
fortunatus
his
purse
it
happened
that
the
book
of
dignities
came
into
my
hand
and
therein
as
it
seemed
to
me
then
i
found
more
follies
than
had
ever
yet
come
before
mine
eyes
and
these
said
i
to
the
secretary
be
all
adam
children
and
of
one
stuff
and
that
dust
and
ashes
whence
cometh
then
so
great
a
difference
his
holiness
his
excellency
his
serenity
be
these
not
properties
of
god
alone
here
is
one
called
and
another
and
why
must
this
word
noble
or
born
be
ever
added
we
know
well
that
no
men
fall
from
heaven
and
none
rise
out
of
the
water
and
none
grow
out
of
the
earth
like
cabbages
the
secretary
must
needs
laugh
at
me
and
took
the
trouble
to
explain
to
me
this
and
that
title
and
all
the
words
separately
yet
did
i
insist
that
the
titles
did
not
do
men
right
for
sure
was
more
credit
to
a
man
to
be
called
merciful
than
worshipful
so
too
if
the
word
noble
signify
in
itself
all
incalculable
virtues
why
should
it
when
placed
in
the
midst
of
the
word
which
applieth
only
to
princes
impair
the
dignity
of
the
title
and
as
to
the
word
why
a
flat
untruth
and
that
could
any
baron
mother
testify
for
if
one
should
ask
her
if
he
was
well
born
she
could
say
whether
was
well
with
her
when
she
brought
him
into
the
world
and
so
we
talked
long
yet
could
he
not
convince
me
but
this
favour
of
the
secretary
towards
me
lasted
not
long
for
by
reason
of
my
boorish
and
filthy
habits
i
presently
after
his
foregoing
discourse
behaved
myself
so
foully
yet
without
evil
intent
in
his
presence
that
he
must
bid
me
betake
myself
to
the
pigs
as
to
my
best
comrades
yet
his
disgust
would
have
been
the
easier
to
bear
had
i
not
fallen
into
yet
greater
disgrace
for
it
fared
so
with
me
as
with
every
honest
man
that
cometh
to
court
where
the
wicked
and
envious
do
make
common
cause
against
him
for
my
lord
had
besides
me
a
rascal
for
a
page
which
had
already
served
him
for
two
years
to
him
i
gave
my
heart
for
he
was
of
like
age
with
myself
and
this
is
jonathan
i
thought
and
thou
art
david
but
he
was
jealous
of
me
by
reason
of
the
great
favour
that
my
lord
shewed
me
and
that
greater
day
by
day
so
he
was
concerned
lest
i
should
step
into
his
shoes
and
therefore
in
secret
looked
upon
me
with
malicious
and
envious
eyes
and
sought
occasion
how
he
might
put
a
for
me
and
by
my
fall
prevent
his
own
yet
were
mine
eyes
as
doves
eyes
and
my
intent
far
different
from
his
nay
i
confided
to
him
all
my
secrets
which
yet
consisted
in
naught
else
than
in
childish
simplicity
and
piety
but
he
innocent
as
i
was
persuaded
me
to
all
manner
of
folly
which
yet
i
accepted
for
truth
and
honesty
followed
his
counsels
and
through
the
same
as
shall
not
fail
to
be
duly
treated
of
in
its
proper
place
fell
into
grievous
misfortunes
how
simplicissimus
got
two
eyes
out
of
one
the
next
day
after
my
discourse
with
the
secretary
my
master
had
appointed
a
princely
entertainment
for
his
officers
and
other
good
friends
for
he
had
received
the
good
news
that
his
men
had
taken
the
strong
castle
of
braunfels
without
loss
of
a
single
man
and
there
must
i
as
at
that
time
was
my
duty
like
any
other
help
to
bring
up
dishes
pour
out
wine
and
wait
at
table
with
a
plate
in
my
hand
the
first
day
there
was
a
big
fat
of
which
folk
are
wont
to
say
no
poor
man
may
eat
handed
to
me
to
carry
up
and
because
this
was
therefore
he
must
needs
have
his
whole
eye
with
the
appurtenance
thereof
hanging
out
which
was
to
me
a
charming
and
a
tempting
sight
and
the
fresh
perfume
of
the
and
ginger
sprinkled
thereon
alluring
me
i
felt
such
appetite
that
my
mouth
did
water
at
it
in
a
word
the
eye
smiled
at
once
on
mine
eyes
my
nostrils
and
my
mouth
and
besought
me
that
i
would
incorporate
it
into
my
hungry
belly
nor
did
i
need
long
forcing
but
followed
my
desires
for
as
i
went
with
a
spoon
that
i
had
first
received
on
that
same
day
i
did
scoop
the
eye
so
masterly
out
and
sent
it
so
swiftly
and
without
let
or
hindrance
to
its
proper
place
that
none
perceived
it
till
the
dish
came
to
table
and
there
betrayed
itself
and
me
for
when
they
would
carve
it
up
and
one
of
its
daintiest
members
was
wanting
my
lord
at
once
perceived
what
made
the
carver
start
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
endure
such
mockery
as
that
any
should
dare
to
say
to
him
he
had
served
up
a
with
one
eye
so
the
cook
must
appear
at
table
and
they
that
should
have
brought
the
dishes
up
were
with
him
examined
and
last
of
all
it
came
out
that
was
to
poor
simplicissimus
the
had
last
been
entrusted
and
that
with
two
eyes
how
it
had
fared
thereafter
no
man
could
say
then
my
lord
as
it
seemed
to
me
with
a
terrible
countenance
asked
what
i
had
done
with
the
calf
eye
so
i
whipt
my
spoon
out
of
my
pouch
again
and
gave
the
the
second
turn
and
shewed
briefly
and
well
what
they
asked
of
me
for
i
swallowed
the
second
eye
like
the
first
in
a
wink
pardieu
quoth
my
lord
this
trick
savoureth
better
than
ten
calves
and
thereupon
all
the
gentlemen
present
praised
that
saying
and
spoke
of
my
deed
which
i
had
done
for
pure
simplicity
as
a
wondrous
device
and
a
presage
of
future
boldness
and
fearless
and
swift
resolution
so
that
for
this
time
by
the
repeating
of
the
very
trick
for
which
i
had
deserved
punishment
i
not
only
escaped
that
punishment
but
from
a
few
merry
jesters
flatterers
and
boon
companions
gained
the
praise
of
acting
wisely
inasmuch
as
i
had
lodged
both
eyes
together
that
so
they
might
in
the
next
world
as
in
this
afford
help
and
company
to
each
other
to
which
end
they
were
at
first
appointed
by
nature
yet
my
lord
warned
me
to
play
him
no
more
such
tricks
how
a
man
step
by
step
may
attain
unto
intoxication
and
finally
unawares
become
blind
drunk
at
this
banquet
and
i
take
it
it
happens
likewise
at
others
all
came
to
table
like
christians
grace
was
said
very
quietly
and
to
all
appearance
very
piously
and
this
pious
silence
lasted
as
long
as
they
had
to
deal
with
the
soup
and
the
first
courses
as
one
had
been
at
a
quakers
meeting
but
hardly
had
each
one
said
god
blessing
three
or
four
times
when
all
was
already
livelier
nor
can
i
describe
how
each
one
voice
grew
louder
and
louder
i
could
but
compare
the
whole
company
to
an
orator
that
beginneth
softly
at
the
first
and
endeth
with
thunder
then
dishes
were
served
called
savouries
which
being
strongly
seasoned
are
appointed
to
be
eaten
before
the
drinking
begin
that
it
may
go
the
livelier
and
likewise
dessert
to
give
a
flavour
to
the
wine
to
say
nothing
of
all
manner
of
french
pottages
and
spanish
olla
podridas
which
by
a
thousand
artful
preparations
and
unnumbered
ingredients
were
in
such
wise
spiced
devilled
disguised
and
seasoned
and
all
to
further
the
drinking
that
they
by
such
added
ingredients
and
spices
were
altogether
changed
in
their
substance
and
different
from
what
nature
had
made
them
so
that
gnaeus
manlius
himself
though
he
had
come
direct
from
africa
and
had
with
him
the
best
of
cooks
yet
had
not
recognised
them
then
thought
i
not
like
enough
that
these
things
should
disturb
the
senses
of
any
man
who
can
take
delight
in
them
and
the
drink
too
whereto
they
be
specially
appointed
and
change
him
or
even
transform
him
to
a
beast
who
knows
if
even
circe
used
any
other
means
but
these
when
she
did
change
ulysses
his
companions
into
swine
for
i
saw
how
these
guests
at
one
time
devoured
the
food
like
hogs
and
then
swilled
like
sows
then
carried
themselves
like
asses
and
last
of
all
were
as
sick
as
dogs
the
noble
wines
of
hochheim
of
bacharach
and
of
klingenberg
they
tipped
into
their
bellies
in
glasses
as
big
as
buckets
which
presently
shewed
their
effects
higher
up
in
the
head
and
thereupon
i
saw
with
wonder
how
all
changed
for
here
were
reputable
folk
which
just
before
were
in
possession
of
their
five
senses
and
sitting
in
peace
by
one
another
now
beginning
of
a
sudden
to
act
the
fool
and
to
play
the
silliest
tricks
in
the
world
and
the
great
follies
which
they
did
commit
and
the
huge
draughts
which
they
drank
to
each
other
became
bigger
as
time
went
on
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
fooleries
and
draughts
strove
with
each
other
which
of
them
should
be
accounted
the
greater
but
at
last
this
contest
ended
in
a
filthy
piggishness
was
not
wonderful
that
i
understood
not
whence
their
giddiness
came
inasmuch
as
the
effect
of
wine
and
drunkenness
itself
were
until
now
quite
unknown
to
me
and
this
left
in
my
roguish
remembrance
thereafter
all
manner
of
merry
pranks
and
fantastic
imaginings
their
strange
looks
i
could
see
but
the
cause
of
their
condition
i
knew
not
indeed
up
till
then
each
one
had
emptied
the
pot
with
a
good
appetite
but
when
now
their
bellies
were
full
was
as
hard
with
them
as
with
a
waggoner
that
can
fare
well
enough
with
his
team
over
level
ground
yet
up
the
hill
can
scarcely
toil
but
though
their
heads
were
bemused
their
want
of
strength
was
made
good
in
one
man
case
by
his
courage
well
soaked
in
wine
in
another
the
loyal
desire
to
drink
yet
one
health
to
his
friend
in
a
third
that
german
chivalry
which
must
do
his
neighbour
right
but
even
such
efforts
must
fail
in
the
long
run
then
would
one
challenge
another
to
pour
the
wine
in
in
buckets
to
the
health
of
the
princes
or
of
dear
friends
or
of
a
mistress
and
at
this
many
a
eyes
turned
in
his
head
and
the
cold
sweat
broke
out
yet
still
the
drinking
must
go
on
yea
at
the
last
they
must
make
a
noise
with
drums
fifes
and
stringed
instruments
and
shot
off
the
ordnance
doubtless
for
this
cause
because
the
wine
must
take
their
bellies
by
assault
then
did
i
wonder
where
they
could
be
rid
of
it
all
for
i
knew
not
that
they
would
turn
out
the
same
before
was
well
warm
within
them
and
that
with
great
pains
out
of
the
very
place
into
which
they
had
just
before
poured
it
to
the
great
danger
of
their
health
at
this
feast
was
also
my
pastor
and
because
he
was
a
man
like
other
men
he
must
retire
for
a
while
so
i
followed
him
and
pastor
said
i
why
do
these
folk
behave
so
strangely
how
comes
it
that
they
do
reel
this
way
and
that
sure
it
seems
to
me
they
be
no
longer
in
their
senses
for
they
have
all
eaten
and
drunken
themselves
full
and
swear
devil
take
them
if
they
can
drink
more
and
yet
they
cease
not
to
swill
be
they
compelled
thereto
or
is
it
in
god
despite
that
they
of
their
free
will
waste
all
things
so
wantonly
dear
child
answered
the
pastor
when
the
wine
is
in
the
wit
is
out
this
is
nought
compared
with
what
is
to
come
at
daybreak
be
hardly
time
for
them
to
break
up
for
though
they
have
already
crammed
their
bellies
yet
they
are
not
yet
right
merry
so
i
answered
then
do
not
their
bellies
burst
if
they
stuff
them
so
continually
can
then
their
souls
which
are
god
image
abide
in
such
fat
hog
bodies
in
which
they
lie
as
it
were
in
dark
cells
and
verminous
dungeons
imprisoned
without
knowledge
of
god
their
precious
souls
i
say
how
can
they
so
let
themselves
be
tortured
be
not
their
senses
of
which
their
souls
should
be
served
buried
as
in
the
bowels
of
unreasoning
beasts
hold
thou
thy
tongue
answered
the
pastor
or
thou
mayest
get
thee
a
sound
thrashing
here
is
no
time
to
preach
or
i
could
do
it
better
than
thou
so
when
i
heard
this
i
looked
on
in
silence
further
and
saw
how
they
wantonly
spoiled
food
and
drink
notwithstanding
that
the
poor
lazarus
that
might
have
been
nourished
therewith
languished
before
our
gates
in
the
shape
of
many
hundred
expelled
peasants
of
the
wetterau
whose
hunger
looked
out
through
their
eyes
for
in
the
town
there
was
famine
still
treats
of
naught
but
of
drinking
bouts
and
how
to
be
rid
of
parsons
thereat
so
this
gormandising
went
on
as
before
and
i
must
wait
on
them
as
from
the
beginning
of
the
feast
my
pastor
was
still
there
and
was
forced
to
drink
as
well
as
the
rest
yet
would
he
not
do
like
them
but
said
he
cared
not
to
drink
in
so
beastly
a
fashion
so
a
valiant
pot
companion
takes
him
up
and
shews
him
that
he
a
pastor
drinks
like
a
beast
and
he
the
drunkard
and
others
present
drink
like
men
for
says
he
a
beast
drinks
only
so
much
as
tastes
well
to
him
and
quenches
his
thirst
for
he
knows
not
what
is
good
nor
doth
he
care
to
drink
wine
at
all
but
is
the
pleasure
of
us
men
to
make
the
drink
profit
us
and
to
suck
in
the
noble
as
our
forefathers
did
yes
yes
says
the
pastor
but
for
me
is
proper
to
keep
due
measure
right
says
the
other
a
man
of
honour
must
keep
his
word
and
thereupon
he
has
a
beaker
filled
which
held
a
full
measure
and
with
that
in
his
hand
he
reels
back
to
the
pastor
but
he
was
gone
and
left
the
tippler
in
the
lurch
with
his
so
when
they
were
rid
of
the
pastor
all
was
confusion
and
was
for
all
the
world
in
appearance
as
if
this
feast
was
an
agreed
time
and
opportunity
for
each
to
disgrace
his
neighbour
with
drunkenness
to
bring
him
to
shame
or
to
play
him
some
scurvy
trick
for
when
one
of
them
was
so
well
settled
that
he
could
neither
sit
walk
nor
stand
the
cry
was
now
we
are
quits
thou
didst
brew
a
like
draught
for
me
now
must
thou
drink
the
like
and
so
on
but
he
that
could
last
longest
and
drink
deepest
was
full
of
pride
thereat
and
seemed
to
himself
a
fellow
of
no
mean
parts
and
at
the
last
they
tumbled
about
as
they
had
drunk
henbane
was
indeed
a
wonderful
pantomime
to
see
how
they
did
fool
and
yet
none
wondered
but
i
one
sang
one
wept
one
laughed
another
moaned
one
cursed
another
prayed
one
shouted
courage
another
could
not
even
speak
one
was
quiet
and
peaceable
another
would
drive
the
devil
out
by
swaggering
one
slept
and
was
silent
another
talked
so
fast
that
none
could
stand
up
against
him
one
told
stories
of
tender
love
adventures
another
of
his
dreadful
deeds
in
war
some
talked
of
church
and
clergy
some
of
the
constitution
of
politics
of
the
affairs
of
the
empire
and
of
the
world
some
ran
hither
and
thither
and
could
not
keep
still
some
lay
where
they
were
and
could
not
stir
a
finger
much
less
stand
up
or
walk
some
were
still
eating
like
ploughmen
and
as
if
they
had
been
a
week
without
food
while
others
were
vomiting
up
what
they
had
eaten
that
very
day
in
a
word
their
whole
carriage
was
comical
strange
and
mad
and
moreover
sinful
and
godless
at
the
last
there
arose
at
the
lower
end
of
the
table
real
quarrels
so
that
they
flung
glasses
cups
dishes
and
plates
at
each
other
heads
and
fought
not
with
fists
only
but
with
chairs
and
legs
of
chairs
yea
with
swords
and
whatever
came
to
hand
till
some
had
the
red
blood
running
down
their
ears
but
to
that
my
lord
presently
put
an
end
how
the
lord
governor
shot
a
very
foul
fox
so
when
order
was
restored
the
took
with
them
the
minstrels
and
the
womenfolk
and
away
to
another
house
wherein
was
a
great
room
chosen
and
dedicated
for
another
sort
of
folly
but
my
lord
throws
himself
on
his
for
either
from
anger
or
from
he
was
in
pain
so
i
let
him
lie
where
he
was
to
rest
and
sleep
but
hardly
had
i
come
to
the
door
of
the
room
when
he
must
needs
whistle
to
me
and
that
he
could
not
then
he
would
call
but
naught
could
he
say
but
simple
so
i
ran
back
to
him
and
found
his
eyes
turn
in
his
head
as
with
a
beast
that
is
slaughtered
and
there
stood
i
before
him
like
a
neither
did
i
know
what
to
do
but
he
pointed
to
the
washstand
and
stammered
out
me
that
thou
rogue
me
the
basin
i
shoot
a
so
with
all
haste
i
brought
him
the
silver
but
ere
i
could
come
to
him
he
had
a
pair
of
cheeks
like
a
trumpeter
then
he
took
me
quickly
by
the
arm
and
made
me
so
to
stand
that
i
must
hold
the
basin
right
before
his
mouth
then
all
must
out
with
grievous
retchings
and
such
foul
stuff
was
discharged
into
the
said
basin
that
i
near
fainted
away
by
reason
of
the
unbearable
stench
and
specially
because
some
fragments
spurted
up
into
my
face
and
nearly
did
i
do
the
same
but
when
i
marked
how
deadly
pale
he
was
i
gave
that
over
for
sheer
fright
and
feared
only
his
soul
would
leave
him
with
his
vomit
for
the
cold
sweat
broke
out
upon
his
forehead
and
his
face
was
like
a
dying
man
but
when
he
recovered
himself
he
bade
me
fetch
fresh
water
that
with
that
he
might
rinse
out
the
into
which
he
had
made
his
belly
thereafter
he
bade
me
take
away
the
fox
and
because
i
knew
not
where
i
should
bestow
such
a
precious
treasure
which
besides
that
it
was
in
a
silver
dish
was
composed
of
all
manner
of
dainties
that
i
had
seen
my
lord
eat
i
took
it
to
the
steward
to
him
i
shewed
this
fine
stuff
and
asked
what
i
should
do
with
the
fox
thou
fool
says
he
go
and
take
it
to
the
tanner
to
tan
his
hides
therewith
so
i
asked
where
could
i
find
the
tanner
but
he
perceiving
my
simplicity
nay
says
he
take
it
to
the
doctor
that
he
may
see
from
it
what
our
lord
state
of
health
is
and
such
an
april
fool
journey
had
i
surely
gone
but
that
the
steward
was
affrighted
at
what
might
follow
he
bade
me
therefore
take
the
filth
to
the
kitchen
with
orders
that
the
maids
should
serve
it
up
with
seasoning
and
this
i
did
in
all
good
faith
and
was
by
those
baggages
soundly
laughed
at
for
my
pains
how
simplicissimus
spoiled
the
dance
just
as
i
was
free
of
my
basin
my
lord
was
going
forth
so
i
followed
him
to
a
great
house
where
in
a
room
i
saw
gentlemen
and
ladies
bachelors
and
maidens
twisting
about
so
quickly
that
everything
spun
round
with
such
stamping
and
noise
that
i
deemed
they
were
all
gone
mad
for
i
could
not
imagine
what
they
could
intend
with
this
rage
and
fury
yea
the
very
sight
of
them
was
so
terrible
so
fearful
and
so
dreadful
that
all
my
hair
stood
on
end
and
i
could
believe
nothing
but
that
they
were
all
bereft
of
reason
and
as
we
came
nearer
i
was
aware
that
these
were
our
guests
which
had
up
till
noon
been
in
their
right
senses
good
god
thought
i
what
do
these
poor
folk
intend
to
do
surely
madness
is
come
upon
them
yet
presently
i
thought
these
might
perchance
be
hellish
spirits
which
under
this
disguise
did
make
a
mock
of
the
whole
human
race
by
such
wanton
capers
and
for
i
thought
had
they
human
souls
and
god
image
in
them
sure
they
would
not
act
so
unlike
to
men
when
my
lord
came
in
and
would
enter
the
room
the
tumult
ceased
save
that
there
was
such
bowing
and
ducking
with
the
heads
and
such
curtseying
and
scraping
with
the
feet
on
the
floor
that
methought
they
would
scrape
out
the
they
had
trodden
in
their
furious
madness
and
by
the
sweat
that
ran
down
their
faces
and
by
their
puffing
and
blowing
i
could
perceive
they
had
struggled
hard
yet
did
their
cheerful
countenances
declare
that
such
labours
had
not
vexed
them
now
was
i
fain
to
know
what
this
mad
behaviour
might
mean
and
therefore
asked
of
my
comrade
and
trusted
confidant
what
such
lunatic
doings
might
signify
or
for
what
purpose
this
furious
ramping
and
stamping
was
intended
and
he
as
the
real
truth
told
me
that
all
there
present
had
agreed
to
stamp
down
the
floor
of
the
room
for
how
says
he
canst
thou
otherwise
suppose
that
they
would
so
stamp
about
hast
thou
not
seen
how
they
broke
all
the
windows
for
pastime
even
so
will
they
break
in
this
floor
good
heavens
quoth
i
then
must
we
also
fall
and
in
falling
break
our
legs
and
our
necks
in
their
company
yea
quoth
my
comrade
is
their
purpose
and
therefore
do
they
work
so
devilishly
hard
and
thou
wilt
see
that
when
they
do
find
themselves
in
danger
of
death
each
one
seizes
upon
a
fair
lady
or
maiden
for
is
said
that
to
couples
that
fall
holding
one
another
in
this
way
no
grievous
harm
is
wont
to
happen
now
as
i
believed
all
this
tale
there
fell
upon
me
such
anguish
and
fear
of
death
that
i
knew
not
where
i
should
stand
and
when
the
minstrels
which
i
had
not
before
seen
made
themselves
likewise
heard
and
every
man
ran
to
his
lady
as
soldiers
run
to
their
guns
or
to
their
ranks
when
they
hear
the
drums
beat
the
alarm
and
each
man
took
his
partner
by
the
hand
was
to
me
even
as
if
i
saw
the
floor
already
and
my
neck
and
those
of
many
others
but
when
they
began
to
jump
so
that
the
whole
building
shook
for
they
played
just
then
a
lively
galop
then
thought
i
now
is
thy
life
at
stake
for
i
thought
nought
else
but
that
the
whole
building
would
suddenly
tumble
in
so
in
my
deadly
fear
i
seized
upon
a
lady
of
high
nobility
and
eminent
virtues
with
whom
my
lord
was
even
then
conversing
her
i
caught
all
unawares
by
the
arm
like
a
bear
and
clung
to
her
like
a
burr
but
when
she
struggled
as
not
knowing
what
foolish
fancies
were
in
my
head
i
acted
as
one
desperate
and
for
sheer
despair
began
to
scream
as
if
they
would
murder
me
now
did
the
music
cease
of
a
sudden
the
dancers
and
their
partners
stopped
dancing
and
the
honourable
lady
to
whose
arm
i
still
clung
deemed
herself
grievously
insulted
for
she
fancied
my
lord
had
had
all
this
done
for
her
annoyance
who
thereupon
commanded
that
i
should
be
soundly
whipped
and
then
locked
up
somewhere
for
said
he
was
not
the
first
trick
i
had
played
on
him
that
day
yet
the
grooms
which
were
to
carry
out
his
orders
had
sympathy
with
me
and
spared
me
the
whipping
and
locked
me
up
in
a
under
the
staircase
book
ii
how
a
goose
and
a
gander
were
mated
s
in
my
i
pondered
on
all
that
i
have
set
down
in
black
and
white
in
my
first
part
of
which
therefore
there
is
no
need
in
this
place
to
say
more
yet
can
i
not
choose
but
say
that
even
then
i
doubted
whether
the
dancers
in
truth
were
so
mad
to
stamp
the
floor
down
or
whether
i
was
only
so
led
to
believe
now
will
i
further
relate
how
i
came
again
out
of
my
goose
prison
for
three
whole
hours
namely
till
that
praeludium
veneris
i
should
have
said
that
seemly
dance
was
ended
i
must
perforce
sit
till
one
came
softly
and
fumbled
with
the
bolt
so
i
listened
as
quiet
as
any
mouse
and
presently
the
fellow
that
was
at
the
door
not
only
opened
it
but
whipped
in
himself
as
quick
as
i
would
fain
have
whipped
out
and
with
him
by
the
hand
he
led
in
a
lady
even
as
i
had
seen
done
at
the
dancing
i
knew
not
what
was
to
happen
but
because
i
was
now
accustomed
to
all
such
strange
adventures
as
had
happened
to
me
poor
fool
on
that
one
day
and
had
made
up
my
mind
to
bear
with
patience
and
silence
whatever
my
fate
might
bring
me
i
crept
close
to
the
door
and
with
fear
and
trembling
waited
for
the
end
so
presently
there
was
between
these
two
a
whispering
whereof
i
could
understand
naught
save
that
the
one
party
complained
of
the
evil
air
of
the
place
and
on
the
other
hand
the
second
party
would
console
the
first
thereupon
i
heard
kisses
and
observed
strange
postures
yet
knew
not
what
this
should
mean
and
therefore
still
kept
still
as
a
mouse
yet
when
a
comical
noise
arose
and
the
which
was
but
of
boards
nailed
together
below
the
staircase
began
to
shake
and
crack
and
moreover
the
lady
seemed
in
trouble
i
thought
surely
these
be
two
of
those
mad
folk
which
helped
to
stamp
on
the
floor
and
have
now
betaken
themselves
hither
to
behave
in
like
manner
and
bring
thee
to
thy
death
as
soon
as
these
thoughts
came
into
my
head
i
seized
upon
the
door
so
to
escape
death
and
out
i
whipt
with
a
cry
of
murder
as
loud
as
that
which
had
brought
me
to
that
place
yet
had
i
the
sense
to
bolt
the
door
behind
me
and
make
for
the
open
this
was
now
the
first
wedding
i
was
ever
present
at
in
my
life
and
even
to
that
i
had
not
been
invited
on
the
other
hand
i
needed
to
give
no
though
the
bridegroom
did
mark
up
a
heavy
score
against
me
which
i
honourably
discharged
gentle
reader
i
tell
this
story
not
that
thou
mayest
laugh
thereat
but
that
my
history
may
be
complete
and
my
readers
may
take
to
heart
what
honourable
fruits
are
to
be
expected
from
this
dancing
for
this
i
hold
for
certain
that
in
these
dances
many
a
bargain
is
struck
up
whereof
the
whole
company
hath
cause
thereafter
to
be
shamed
concerning
the
merits
and
virtues
of
a
good
bath
at
the
proper
season
and
now
when
i
had
luckily
escaped
from
my
i
was
then
first
aware
of
my
sad
plight
in
my
master
quarters
all
was
sound
asleep
so
dared
i
not
address
myself
to
the
sentry
that
stood
before
the
house
and
at
the
mainguard
assuredly
they
would
not
entertain
me
while
to
abide
in
the
streets
was
too
cold
so
i
knew
not
whither
to
betake
myself
long
past
midnight
it
was
when
it
came
into
my
head
to
seek
refuge
with
the
pastor
so
often
spoken
of
before
and
this
thought
i
followed
so
far
as
to
knock
at
his
door
and
therein
was
so
importunate
that
at
last
the
maid
with
much
ill
will
admitted
me
but
forthwith
she
began
to
chide
with
me
and
this
her
master
who
had
by
this
time
wellnigh
slept
off
his
wine
heard
so
he
called
us
both
to
him
as
he
lay
in
his
chamber
and
ordered
his
maid
to
put
me
to
bed
for
he
could
well
perceive
that
i
was
numbed
with
the
cold
yet
was
i
hardly
warm
in
my
bed
when
day
began
to
break
and
the
good
pastor
stood
by
my
bedside
to
hear
how
it
had
gone
with
me
and
how
my
business
had
fared
for
i
could
not
rise
to
go
to
him
so
i
told
him
all
and
began
with
the
tricks
which
my
comrade
the
page
had
taught
me
and
how
ill
they
had
turned
out
thereafter
i
must
tell
him
how
the
guests
after
he
the
pastor
had
left
the
table
had
lost
their
wits
and
as
my
comrade
had
told
me
determined
to
stamp
down
the
floor
of
the
house
item
into
what
fearful
terror
i
thereupon
fell
and
in
what
fashion
i
tried
to
save
my
life
how
thereafter
i
was
shut
up
in
a
and
what
i
had
noted
in
words
and
works
of
those
two
which
had
delivered
me
and
in
what
manner
i
had
locked
them
both
up
in
my
stead
simplicissimus
said
the
pastor
thy
case
stands
but
lousily
thou
hadst
a
good
opportunity
but
i
fear
i
fear
thou
hast
fooled
it
away
get
thee
quick
out
of
bed
and
pack
out
of
my
house
lest
i
come
with
thee
under
my
lord
displeasure
if
thou
be
found
here
with
me
so
i
must
away
with
my
wet
clothes
and
now
for
the
first
time
must
understand
how
well
he
stands
with
all
and
sundry
who
doth
but
possess
his
master
favour
yet
how
askance
he
is
looked
upon
when
that
favour
halteth
away
i
went
to
my
master
lodging
wherein
all
were
yet
sound
asleep
save
the
cook
and
a
maid
or
two
these
last
were
ordering
the
room
wherein
the
day
before
had
been
the
carouse
and
the
first
was
preparing
from
the
remains
of
the
feast
a
breakfast
or
rather
a
luncheon
so
first
i
betook
myself
to
the
maids
they
had
to
deal
with
all
manner
of
and
strewn
up
and
down
in
some
places
all
was
foul
with
what
the
guests
had
voided
both
upwards
and
downwards
in
other
places
were
great
pools
of
spilt
wine
and
beer
so
that
the
floor
looked
like
a
map
wherein
a
man
could
trace
separate
seas
islands
and
continents
and
in
that
room
was
the
smell
far
worse
than
in
my
and
therefore
i
delayed
not
long
there
but
betook
myself
to
the
kitchen
and
there
had
my
clothes
dried
on
my
body
before
the
fire
expecting
with
fear
and
trembling
what
tricks
fortune
would
further
play
with
me
when
my
lord
should
awake
then
did
i
reflect
upon
all
the
folly
and
senselessness
of
the
world
and
ran
over
in
my
mind
all
that
happened
to
me
in
the
past
day
and
night
and
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
in
that
time
so
when
i
thought
thereon
i
did
even
deem
the
poor
and
miserable
life
which
my
old
hermit
led
a
happy
one
and
heartily
i
wished
him
and
myself
back
in
our
old
place
how
the
other
page
received
payment
for
his
teaching
and
how
simplicissimus
was
chosen
to
be
a
fool
when
my
lord
rose
he
sent
his
orderly
to
fetch
me
from
the
who
brought
news
he
had
found
the
door
open
and
a
hole
cut
with
a
knife
behind
the
bolt
by
which
means
the
prisoner
had
escaped
but
before
such
report
came
my
lord
understood
from
others
that
i
had
for
a
long
time
been
in
the
kitchen
meanwhile
the
servants
must
run
hither
and
thither
to
fetch
yesterday
guests
to
breakfast
among
whom
was
also
the
pastor
who
must
appear
earlier
than
the
rest
because
my
master
would
talk
with
him
concerning
me
before
they
went
to
table
he
asked
him
first
did
he
account
me
sane
or
mad
and
whether
i
was
in
truth
so
simple
or
not
the
rather
mischievous
and
told
him
all
how
unseemly
i
had
carried
myself
all
the
day
and
evening
before
which
was
in
part
taken
amiss
by
his
guests
and
so
regarded
as
if
this
had
been
done
of
malice
and
in
their
despite
item
that
he
had
caused
me
to
be
shut
up
in
a
to
protect
himself
against
such
tricks
as
i
might
yet
further
have
played
him
which
prison
i
had
broken
and
now
held
my
state
in
the
kitchen
like
a
gentleman
who
need
no
longer
wait
on
him
in
his
lifetime
no
such
trick
had
ever
happened
to
him
as
i
had
played
him
in
the
presence
of
so
many
honourable
persons
he
knew
not
what
to
do
with
me
save
to
have
me
soundly
beaten
and
since
i
behaved
myself
so
clownishly
to
send
me
to
the
devil
meantime
while
my
master
so
complained
of
me
the
guests
assembled
by
degrees
so
when
he
had
said
his
say
the
pastor
answered
if
the
lord
governor
would
please
to
hearken
to
him
with
patience
for
a
little
while
he
would
tell
him
this
and
that
regarding
simplicissimus
from
which
not
only
his
innocence
could
be
known
but
also
all
unfavourable
thoughts
removed
from
the
minds
of
them
that
had
taken
a
disgust
at
his
conduct
now
while
they
thus
discoursed
of
me
in
the
chamber
above
that
same
mad
ensign
whom
i
in
mine
own
person
had
imprisoned
in
my
place
makes
a
treaty
with
me
in
the
kitchen
and
by
threats
and
by
a
thaler
which
he
put
in
my
pouch
brought
me
to
this
that
i
promised
him
to
keep
a
still
tongue
concerning
his
doings
so
the
tables
were
set
and
as
on
the
day
before
furnished
with
food
and
with
guests
there
wormwood
sage
wine
elecampane
quince
and
lemon
drinks
with
hippocras
were
to
clear
the
heads
and
stomachs
of
the
drinkers
for
for
one
and
all
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
their
first
talk
was
of
themselves
and
that
chiefly
of
how
brave
a
bout
of
drinking
they
had
had
yesterday
nor
was
there
any
among
them
that
would
truly
confess
he
had
been
drunk
albeit
the
evening
before
some
had
called
the
devil
to
witness
they
could
drink
no
more
some
indeed
confessed
that
they
had
headaches
yet
others
would
have
it
was
only
since
men
had
ceased
to
drink
themselves
full
in
the
good
old
mode
that
such
aches
had
come
in
fashion
but
when
they
were
tired
both
of
hearing
and
talking
of
their
own
follies
poor
simplicissimus
must
bear
the
brunt
and
the
governor
himself
reminded
the
pastor
to
tell
of
those
merry
happenings
which
he
had
promised
so
the
pastor
begged
first
that
none
should
take
offence
inasmuch
as
he
must
use
words
which
might
be
accounted
unbefitting
his
holy
office
then
he
went
on
to
tell
how
sorely
i
was
plagued
by
nature
how
i
had
caused
great
disgust
thereby
to
the
secretary
in
his
office
and
how
i
had
learned
together
with
the
art
of
prophecy
also
certain
enchantments
against
such
mishaps
and
how
ill
such
arts
had
turned
out
when
they
were
tried
item
how
the
dancing
had
seemed
so
strange
to
me
because
i
had
never
seen
the
like
before
what
an
explication
thereof
i
had
heard
from
my
comrade
and
for
what
reason
i
had
seized
upon
the
noble
lady
and
thereupon
had
found
my
way
into
the
all
this
he
enounced
with
such
a
civil
and
discreet
way
of
speaking
that
they
were
fit
to
split
with
laughing
and
so
completely
forgave
my
simplicity
and
ignorance
that
i
was
restored
to
my
master
favour
and
was
allowed
to
wait
at
table
again
but
of
what
had
happened
to
me
in
the
and
how
i
was
delivered
therefrom
would
he
say
nought
for
it
seemed
to
him
some
old
antediluvian
images
might
have
taken
offence
at
him
which
believe
that
pastors
should
always
look
sour
then
again
my
master
to
make
sport
for
his
guests
asked
me
what
had
i
given
to
my
comrade
that
had
taught
me
those
pretty
tricks
so
i
said
nothing
at
all
then
says
he
i
will
pay
him
the
school
fees
for
thee
so
he
had
him
clapt
in
a
winnowing
basket
and
there
soundly
trounced
even
as
i
had
been
dealt
with
the
day
before
when
i
tried
those
magical
arts
and
found
them
false
so
now
my
master
had
proof
enough
of
my
simplicity
and
would
fain
give
me
the
more
occasion
to
make
sport
for
him
and
his
guests
he
saw
well
that
all
the
minstrels
availed
nothing
so
long
as
the
company
had
me
to
make
sport
for
them
for
to
every
one
it
seemed
that
i
with
my
foolish
fancies
was
better
than
a
dozen
lutes
so
he
asked
me
why
i
had
cut
a
hole
in
the
door
of
the
i
answered
another
may
have
done
it
who
then
says
he
why
says
i
he
that
came
to
me
and
who
came
to
thee
quoth
he
nay
says
i
that
may
i
tell
no
man
now
my
master
was
a
man
of
a
quick
wit
and
he
saw
well
how
one
must
go
about
with
me
so
he
turns
him
about
and
of
a
sudden
he
asks
me
who
it
was
that
had
forbidden
me
and
i
of
a
sudden
answered
the
mad
ensign
then
when
i
perceived
by
the
laughter
of
all
that
i
had
mightily
committed
myself
and
the
mad
ensign
who
sat
at
table
also
grew
red
as
a
hot
coal
i
would
say
no
more
till
by
him
it
should
be
allowed
yet
this
was
but
a
matter
of
a
nod
which
served
my
master
instead
of
a
command
to
the
ensign
and
forthwith
i
might
tell
all
i
knew
and
thereupon
my
master
questioned
me
what
the
mad
ensign
had
had
to
do
with
me
in
the
oh
says
i
he
brought
a
young
lady
to
me
there
and
thereupon
there
arose
among
all
that
were
present
such
laughter
that
my
master
could
hear
me
no
longer
let
alone
ask
me
more
questions
and
was
not
needful
for
if
he
had
that
honourable
young
maiden
forsooth
might
have
been
put
to
shame
thereafter
the
controller
of
the
household
told
all
at
table
how
a
little
before
i
had
come
home
from
the
ramparts
and
had
said
i
knew
now
where
the
thunder
and
lightning
came
from
for
i
had
seen
great
beams
on
which
were
all
hollow
inside
into
these
men
rammed
in
with
an
iron
turnip
with
the
tail
off
and
then
tickled
the
beams
behind
with
a
spit
whereupon
there
was
driven
out
in
front
smoke
and
thunder
and
then
they
told
many
more
such
stories
of
me
so
that
for
the
whole
of
that
there
was
no
other
employ
but
to
talk
of
me
and
laugh
at
me
and
this
was
the
cause
of
a
general
conclusion
to
my
destruction
which
was
that
i
should
be
soundly
befooled
for
with
such
treatment
i
should
in
time
prove
a
rare
jester
by
whose
means
one
could
do
honour
to
the
greatest
princes
in
the
world
and
cause
laughter
to
a
dying
man
concerning
the
man
that
pays
the
money
and
of
the
military
service
that
simplicissimus
did
for
the
crown
of
sweden
through
which
service
he
got
the
name
of
simplicissimus
but
now
as
they
began
to
carouse
and
to
make
merry
as
they
had
done
the
day
before
the
watch
brings
news
together
with
the
delivery
of
letters
to
the
governor
of
a
commissary
that
was
at
the
gate
which
same
was
appointed
by
the
war
council
of
the
crown
of
sweden
to
review
the
garrison
and
survey
the
fortress
such
news
spoiled
all
jesting
and
all
jollity
died
away
like
the
bellows
of
a
bagpipe
when
the
wind
is
gone
out
the
minstrels
and
the
guests
dispersed
themselves
even
as
which
leaves
but
a
smell
behind
it
while
my
lord
with
the
adjutant
who
kept
the
keys
betook
himself
together
with
a
detachment
from
the
mainguard
and
many
torches
to
the
very
gates
himself
to
give
admittance
to
the
blackguts
as
he
called
him
he
wished
he
said
the
devil
had
broke
his
neck
in
a
thousand
pieces
ere
ever
he
came
to
the
city
yet
so
soon
as
he
had
let
him
in
and
welcomed
him
upon
the
inner
drawbridge
it
wanted
but
a
little
or
nothing
at
all
but
he
would
hold
his
stirrup
for
him
to
shew
his
devotion
yea
the
courtesy
to
all
outward
shew
was
between
the
two
so
great
that
the
commissary
must
dismount
and
walk
on
foot
with
my
lord
even
to
his
lodging
and
as
they
walked
each
would
have
the
place
then
thought
i
oh
what
a
wondrous
spirit
of
falsehood
doth
govern
all
mankind
and
so
doth
make
one
a
fool
through
another
help
so
we
drew
near
to
the
mainguard
and
the
sentinel
must
call
who
goes
there
though
well
he
knew
it
was
my
lord
who
would
not
answer
but
would
leave
the
honour
to
that
other
yet
when
the
sentinel
grew
more
impatient
and
repeated
his
challenge
the
commissary
answered
to
the
last
who
goes
there
the
man
who
pays
the
money
now
as
we
passed
the
and
i
came
last
of
all
i
heard
the
sentry
which
was
a
new
recruit
and
before
that
by
profession
a
young
farmer
on
the
vogelsberg
thus
murmur
to
himself
yea
and
a
lying
customer
thou
art
a
man
forsooth
that
pays
the
money
a
that
takes
the
money
that
art
thou
so
much
money
hast
thou
wrung
from
me
that
i
would
to
god
thou
wert
struck
dead
before
thou
shouldst
leave
this
town
so
from
that
hour
i
conceived
this
belief
that
this
foreign
lord
with
the
silk
doublet
must
be
a
holy
man
for
not
only
did
no
curse
harm
him
but
also
even
they
that
hated
him
shewed
him
all
honour
and
love
and
kindness
and
that
night
was
he
princely
entreated
and
made
blind
drunk
and
thereafter
put
to
bed
in
a
noble
bedplace
next
day
then
at
the
review
of
the
troops
everything
was
at
sixes
and
sevens
and
even
i
poor
simple
creature
was
clever
enough
to
cheat
that
clever
commissary
for
to
such
offices
and
administrations
ye
may
well
know
they
do
choose
no
simple
babes
which
same
deceit
i
learned
in
less
than
an
hour
for
the
whole
art
consisted
therein
to
beat
five
with
the
right
hand
and
four
with
the
left
on
a
drum
for
yet
i
was
too
little
to
represent
a
musqueteer
so
they
furnished
me
forth
to
that
end
with
borrowed
clothes
for
my
short
page
breeches
were
in
no
wise
military
to
look
upon
and
with
a
borrowed
drum
without
doubt
for
this
reason
that
i
myself
was
but
borrowed
and
with
all
this
i
came
happily
through
the
inspection
thereafter
nevertheless
would
no
one
trust
my
simple
mind
to
keep
in
my
memory
any
unaccustomed
name
hearing
which
i
should
answer
to
it
and
step
out
of
the
ranks
and
so
must
i
keep
the
name
of
simplicius
and
for
a
surname
the
governor
himself
added
that
of
simplicissimus
and
so
had
me
written
down
in
the
and
so
he
made
me
like
a
bastard
the
first
of
my
family
and
that
although
after
his
own
shewing
i
looked
so
like
his
own
sister
so
ever
thereafter
i
bore
this
name
and
surname
until
i
knew
my
right
name
and
under
that
name
i
played
my
part
pretty
well
to
the
profit
of
the
governor
and
small
danger
to
the
crown
of
sweden
and
this
is
all
the
service
that
ever
i
rendered
to
the
crown
of
sweden
in
all
my
life
and
the
enemies
of
that
crown
can
at
least
not
lay
more
than
this
to
my
charge
how
simplicissimus
was
by
four
devils
brought
into
hell
and
there
treated
with
spanish
wine
now
when
the
commissary
had
gone
the
abovementioned
pastor
bade
me
come
secretly
to
him
to
his
lodging
and
then
said
he
o
simplicissimus
for
thy
youth
i
am
sorry
and
thy
future
misery
moveth
me
to
sympathy
hear
my
child
and
know
of
a
surety
that
thy
master
hath
determined
to
deprive
thee
of
all
reason
and
so
to
make
of
thee
a
fool
yea
and
to
that
end
hath
he
already
commanded
raiment
to
be
made
ready
for
thee
so
must
thou
go
to
school
and
in
that
school
thou
art
to
unlearn
thy
reason
and
in
that
school
without
doubt
they
will
so
grievously
torment
thee
that
unless
god
help
thee
and
other
means
be
used
against
it
without
doubt
thou
wilt
become
a
madman
now
because
such
is
a
wrong
and
dangerous
manner
of
dealing
and
likewise
because
i
for
thy
hermit
piety
sake
and
for
thine
own
innocence
sake
desire
to
serve
thee
and
with
true
christian
love
to
assist
thee
with
counsel
and
all
necessary
help
and
to
give
thee
relief
in
trouble
therefore
follow
thou
now
my
teaching
and
take
this
powder
which
will
in
such
wise
strengthen
thy
brain
and
wits
that
thou
without
danger
to
thine
understanding
mayst
endure
all
things
most
easily
here
likewise
hast
thou
an
ointment
with
which
thou
must
smear
thy
temples
thy
spine
and
the
nape
of
thy
neck
and
also
thy
nostrils
and
both
these
things
must
thou
use
at
when
thou
goest
to
bed
seeing
at
no
time
thou
wilt
be
safe
against
being
fetched
forth
from
thy
bed
but
look
thou
that
no
one
be
ware
of
this
my
warning
and
the
remedy
that
i
impart
to
thee
else
might
it
go
ill
with
me
and
thee
and
when
they
shall
have
thee
under
their
accursed
treatment
do
thou
heed
not
nor
believe
not
all
of
which
they
will
strive
to
persuade
thee
and
yet
so
carry
thyself
as
if
thou
believest
all
say
but
little
lest
thine
attendants
mark
in
thy
conduct
that
they
do
but
thresh
straw
for
then
will
they
change
the
fashion
of
thy
torments
though
in
truth
i
know
not
in
what
manner
they
will
go
about
to
deal
with
thee
but
when
thou
shalt
be
clad
in
thy
plumes
and
thy
fool
coat
then
come
again
to
me
that
i
may
further
serve
thee
with
counsel
and
meanwhile
will
i
pray
god
for
thee
that
he
may
protect
thine
understanding
and
thy
health
of
body
with
that
he
gives
me
the
said
powder
and
ointment
and
so
i
betook
myself
home
now
even
as
the
pastor
had
said
so
it
happened
in
my
first
sleep
came
four
rogues
disguised
with
frightful
devils
masks
into
my
room
and
to
my
bed
and
there
they
capered
around
like
mountebanks
and
fools
there
had
one
a
hook
and
another
a
torch
in
his
hands
but
the
other
two
fell
upon
me
and
dragged
me
out
of
bed
and
danced
around
with
me
for
a
time
and
then
forced
me
to
put
on
my
clothes
while
i
so
pretended
as
if
i
had
taken
them
for
true
and
natural
devils
shrieked
murder
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
shewed
all
the
effects
of
the
greatest
terror
so
they
told
me
i
must
go
with
them
and
with
that
they
bound
a
napkin
round
my
head
so
that
i
could
neither
see
hear
nor
cry
out
then
they
led
me
by
many
winding
ways
up
and
down
many
stairs
and
at
last
into
a
cellar
wherein
was
a
great
fire
burning
and
when
they
had
unbound
the
napkin
then
they
began
to
drink
to
me
in
spanish
wine
and
malmsey
and
fain
would
they
persuade
me
i
was
dead
and
what
is
more
in
the
depths
of
hell
for
i
was
careful
to
keep
such
a
carriage
as
if
i
believed
all
that
they
pretended
then
said
they
drink
lustily
for
thou
must
for
ever
abide
with
us
but
if
thou
wilt
not
be
a
good
fellow
and
take
thy
part
thou
must
forthwith
into
this
fire
that
thou
seest
these
poor
devils
would
have
disguised
their
speech
and
voice
yet
i
marked
at
once
they
were
my
lord
grooms
yet
i
let
them
not
perceive
this
but
laughed
in
my
sleeve
that
they
that
would
make
me
a
fool
must
themselves
be
my
fools
so
i
drank
my
share
of
the
spanish
wine
but
they
drank
more
than
i
for
such
heavenly
nectar
cometh
rarely
to
such
customers
insomuch
that
i
could
swear
they
would
be
drunk
sooner
than
i
but
when
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
right
time
i
so
behaved
myself
with
reeling
this
way
and
that
as
i
had
seen
my
master
guests
lately
do
and
at
last
would
drink
no
more
but
sleep
but
no
they
began
to
chase
me
all
round
the
cellar
and
prick
me
with
their
prong
which
all
the
time
they
had
left
to
lie
in
the
fire
till
it
seemed
as
if
they
themselves
had
gone
mad
and
that
to
make
me
drink
more
or
at
least
not
go
to
sleep
and
whenever
being
thus
baited
i
fell
down
and
this
i
often
did
purposely
then
they
seized
upon
me
and
made
as
if
they
would
cast
me
into
the
fire
so
was
it
with
me
as
with
a
hawk
that
is
kept
from
sleep
and
this
was
my
great
torment
is
true
i
could
have
lasted
them
out
both
in
respect
of
drunkenness
and
sleep
but
they
stayed
not
all
the
time
altogether
but
relieved
one
another
watch
and
so
at
last
must
i
have
failed
three
days
and
two
nights
did
i
spend
in
that
smoky
cellar
which
had
no
other
light
but
that
which
the
fire
gave
out
and
so
my
head
began
to
hum
and
to
feel
as
if
burst
so
that
at
last
i
must
contrive
some
device
to
rid
me
at
once
of
my
torment
and
of
my
tormentors
and
this
did
i
even
as
does
the
fox
when
he
can
not
escape
the
hounds
and
that
so
well
that
my
devils
could
no
longer
endure
to
be
near
me
so
to
punish
me
they
laid
me
in
a
sheet
and
trounced
me
so
unmercifully
that
all
my
inward
parts
might
well
have
come
out
soul
and
all
and
what
they
did
further
with
me
i
know
not
so
gone
was
i
from
my
senses
how
simplicissimus
went
up
to
heaven
and
was
turned
into
a
calf
now
when
i
came
to
myself
i
found
myself
no
longer
in
the
gloomy
cellar
with
the
devils
but
in
a
fine
room
under
the
charge
of
three
of
the
foulest
old
wives
that
ever
the
earth
bore
i
held
them
at
first
when
i
opened
my
eyes
a
little
for
real
spirits
of
hell
but
had
i
then
read
the
old
heathen
poets
i
should
have
deemed
them
to
be
the
furies
or
at
least
have
taken
one
for
tisiphone
come
from
hell
to
rob
me
like
athamas
of
my
wits
for
well
i
knew
i
was
there
to
be
turned
into
a
fool
for
she
had
a
pair
of
eyes
like
two
and
between
the
same
a
long
thin
hawk
nose
whose
end
or
point
reached
at
least
to
her
lower
lip
and
two
teeth
only
could
i
see
in
her
mouth
and
those
so
perfect
long
round
and
thick
that
each
might
for
its
form
be
likened
to
a
and
for
its
colour
to
the
gold
ring
itself
in
a
word
there
was
enough
to
make
up
a
mouthful
of
teeth
yet
ill
distributed
her
face
was
like
spanish
leather
and
her
grey
hair
hung
in
a
strange
confusion
about
her
head
for
they
had
but
just
fetched
her
from
her
bed
in
truth
it
was
a
fearsome
sight
which
could
serve
for
nought
else
but
as
an
excellent
remedy
against
the
unreasonable
lust
of
a
salacious
goat
the
other
two
were
no
whit
handsomer
save
that
they
had
blunt
apes
noses
and
had
put
on
their
clothes
somewhat
more
orderly
so
when
i
had
a
little
recovered
myself
i
perceived
that
the
one
was
our
and
the
other
two
wives
of
two
grooms
i
pretended
as
though
i
could
not
move
and
in
truth
i
was
in
no
condition
for
dancing
whereupon
these
honest
old
beldames
stripped
me
stark
naked
and
cleansed
me
from
all
filth
like
a
young
child
yea
while
the
work
was
they
shewed
me
great
patience
and
much
compassion
insomuch
that
i
nearly
revealed
to
them
how
it
truly
stood
with
me
yet
i
thought
nay
simplicissimus
trust
thou
in
no
old
women
but
consider
thou
hast
victory
enough
if
thou
in
thy
youth
canst
deceive
three
such
crafty
old
hags
with
whose
help
one
could
catch
the
devil
in
the
open
field
from
such
beginnings
thou
mayst
hope
in
thine
old
age
to
do
yet
greater
things
so
when
they
had
ended
with
me
they
laid
me
in
a
splendid
bed
wherein
i
fell
asleep
without
rocking
but
they
departed
and
took
their
tubs
and
other
things
wherewith
they
had
washed
me
away
with
them
and
my
clothes
likewise
then
according
to
my
reckoning
did
i
sleep
at
one
stretch
hours
and
when
i
awoke
there
stood
two
pretty
lads
with
wings
before
my
bed
which
were
finely
decked
out
with
white
shirts
taffety
ribbons
pearls
and
jewels
as
also
golden
chains
and
the
like
dazzling
trinkets
one
had
a
gilded
trencher
full
of
cakes
shortbread
marchpane
and
other
confectionery
but
the
other
a
gilded
flagon
in
his
hand
these
two
angels
for
such
they
gave
themselves
out
to
be
sought
to
persuade
me
i
was
now
in
heaven
for
that
i
had
happily
endured
purgatory
and
had
escaped
from
the
devil
and
his
dam
so
need
i
only
ask
what
my
heart
desired
for
all
that
i
could
wish
was
at
hand
or
if
not
they
could
presently
fetch
it
now
i
was
tormented
by
thirst
and
as
i
saw
the
beaker
before
me
i
desired
only
drink
which
was
willingly
handed
to
me
yet
was
it
no
wine
but
a
gentle
which
i
drank
at
one
pull
and
with
that
again
fell
asleep
so
soon
as
it
grew
warm
within
me
the
next
day
i
woke
once
more
for
else
had
i
still
been
sleeping
yet
found
myself
no
longer
in
bed
nor
in
the
aforesaid
room
but
in
mine
old
there
too
was
hideous
darkness
even
as
in
the
cellar
and
besides
that
i
had
on
a
garment
of
whereof
the
rough
side
was
turned
outwards
the
breeches
were
cut
in
polish
or
swabian
fashion
and
the
doublet
too
shaped
in
a
yet
more
foolish
wise
and
on
my
neck
was
a
headpiece
like
a
monk
cowl
this
was
drawn
down
over
my
head
and
ornamented
with
a
fine
pair
of
great
asses
ears
then
must
i
perforce
laugh
at
mine
own
plight
for
well
i
saw
by
the
nest
and
the
feathers
what
manner
of
bird
i
was
to
be
and
at
that
time
i
first
began
to
reason
with
myself
and
to
reflect
what
i
had
best
do
so
this
i
determined
to
play
the
fool
to
the
uttermost
as
i
might
have
the
chance
now
and
again
and
meanwhile
to
wait
with
patience
how
my
fate
would
shape
itself
how
simplicissimus
accommodated
himself
to
the
state
of
a
brute
beast
now
it
had
been
easy
for
me
by
means
of
the
hole
which
the
mad
ensign
had
cut
in
the
door
before
to
free
myself
but
because
i
must
now
be
a
fool
i
let
that
alone
and
not
only
did
i
behave
like
a
fool
who
hath
not
the
wit
of
his
own
motion
to
release
himself
but
did
even
present
myself
as
a
hungry
calf
that
pineth
for
its
mother
nor
was
it
long
before
my
bleating
was
heard
of
them
that
were
appointed
to
watch
me
for
presently
there
came
two
soldiers
to
the
and
asked
who
was
in
there
so
i
answered
ye
fools
hear
ye
not
that
a
calf
is
in
here
and
with
that
they
opened
the
pen
and
brought
me
out
and
wondered
how
a
calf
could
so
speak
which
forced
performance
became
them
even
as
well
as
doth
the
awkward
attempt
of
a
comedian
who
can
not
play
his
part
and
that
so
much
so
that
i
thought
often
i
must
help
them
to
play
their
jest
out
so
they
took
counsel
what
they
should
do
with
me
and
agreed
to
make
me
a
present
to
the
governor
as
one
who
would
give
them
a
larger
reward
if
i
could
speak
than
the
butcher
would
pay
for
me
then
they
questioned
me
how
i
did
and
i
answered
sorrily
enough
so
they
asked
why
and
i
said
for
this
reason
that
here
it
is
the
fashion
to
shut
up
honest
calves
in
ye
rogues
must
know
that
a
proper
ox
will
in
due
time
come
of
me
and
so
must
i
be
brought
up
as
becometh
an
honourable
steer
so
after
this
brief
discourse
they
had
me
with
them
across
the
street
to
the
governor
quarters
a
great
crowd
of
boys
following
us
and
inasmuch
as
they
like
myself
all
bleated
loud
like
a
calf
the
very
blind
could
have
guessed
by
the
hearing
that
a
whole
herd
of
calves
was
being
driven
past
whereas
by
our
looks
we
might
be
likened
to
a
pack
of
young
fools
and
old
then
was
i
by
my
two
soldiers
presented
to
the
governor
for
all
the
world
as
if
they
had
taken
me
as
plunder
them
he
rewarded
with
a
gratification
but
to
me
he
promised
the
best
post
that
i
could
have
about
him
so
i
thought
of
the
goldsmith
apprentice
and
answered
thus
good
my
lord
but
none
must
clap
me
into
for
we
calves
can
endure
no
such
treatment
if
we
are
to
grow
and
to
turn
into
fine
heads
of
cattle
the
governor
promised
me
better
things
and
thought
himself
a
clever
fellow
to
have
made
so
presentable
a
fool
out
of
me
but
no
thought
i
wait
thou
my
dear
master
i
have
endured
the
trial
by
fire
and
therein
have
i
been
hardened
now
will
we
try
which
of
us
two
can
best
trick
the
other
now
just
then
a
peasant
that
had
fled
into
the
city
was
driving
his
cattle
to
drink
which
when
i
saw
forthwith
i
left
the
governor
and
ran
to
the
cows
bleating
like
a
calf
even
as
though
i
would
suck
but
they
when
i
came
to
them
were
more
terrified
at
me
than
a
wolf
albeit
i
wore
hair
of
their
kind
yea
they
were
so
affrighted
and
scattered
so
quickly
from
one
another
as
if
a
hornet
nest
had
been
let
loose
among
them
in
august
so
that
their
master
could
not
again
bring
them
together
at
the
same
place
which
occasioned
pretty
sport
and
in
a
wink
a
crowd
of
folk
ran
together
to
see
this
fool
jape
and
as
my
lord
laughed
till
he
was
fit
to
burst
at
last
he
said
truly
one
fool
maketh
a
hundred
more
but
i
thought
to
myself
yea
and
thou
speakest
this
truth
of
thine
own
self
and
as
from
that
time
forward
each
must
call
me
the
calf
so
i
for
my
part
had
a
scoffing
nickname
for
every
one
which
same
according
to
the
opinion
of
all
and
especially
of
my
lord
turned
out
most
wittily
for
i
christened
each
as
his
qualities
demanded
in
a
word
many
did
count
me
for
a
witless
madman
while
i
held
all
for
fools
in
their
wits
and
to
my
thinking
this
is
still
the
way
of
the
world
for
each
one
is
content
with
his
own
wits
and
esteemeth
that
he
is
of
all
men
the
cleverest
the
said
jest
which
i
played
with
the
peasant
cattle
made
a
short
forenoon
still
shorter
for
was
then
about
the
winter
solstice
at
i
waited
as
before
but
besides
that
i
played
many
quaint
tricks
as
that
when
i
must
eat
no
man
could
force
me
to
take
food
or
drink
for
i
said
roundly
i
would
have
only
grass
which
at
that
time
was
impossible
to
come
by
so
my
lord
had
a
fresh
pair
of
fetched
from
the
butcher
and
the
same
pulled
over
the
heads
of
two
little
boys
and
these
he
set
by
me
at
table
and
for
a
first
course
set
before
us
a
dish
of
winter
salad
and
bade
us
fall
to
lustily
yea
he
commanded
to
bring
a
live
calf
and
entice
him
with
salt
to
eat
the
salad
so
i
looked
on
staring
as
if
i
wondered
at
this
but
the
thing
gave
me
occasion
to
play
my
part
the
better
of
a
certainty
said
they
when
they
saw
me
so
unmoved
is
no
new
thing
if
calves
do
eat
flesh
fish
cheese
and
butter
yea
and
at
times
drink
themselves
soundly
drunk
nowadays
the
beasts
do
know
what
is
good
ay
and
is
nowadays
come
to
that
that
but
little
difference
is
to
be
found
between
them
and
mankind
wilt
thou
not
play
thy
part
therein
and
to
that
i
was
the
more
easily
persuaded
in
that
i
was
hungry
and
not
because
i
had
before
seen
with
mine
own
eyes
how
men
could
be
more
swinish
than
pigs
more
savage
than
lions
more
lustful
than
goats
more
envious
than
dogs
more
unruly
than
horses
more
stupid
than
asses
more
mad
for
drink
than
the
brutes
craftier
than
foxes
greedier
than
wolves
sillier
than
apes
and
more
poisonous
than
asps
and
toads
yet
all
alike
partook
of
men
food
and
only
by
their
shape
were
discerned
from
the
beasts
and
specially
in
respect
of
innocence
were
they
to
be
counted
far
below
the
poor
calf
so
i
ate
my
fill
with
my
fellow
calves
as
much
as
my
appetite
demanded
and
if
a
stranger
had
unexpectedly
thus
beheld
me
sitting
at
table
without
doubt
he
had
imagined
that
circe
of
old
had
risen
up
again
to
turn
men
into
beasts
which
art
my
master
then
knew
and
practised
and
as
i
took
my
dinner
so
was
i
treated
at
my
supper
and
even
as
my
fellow
guests
or
parasites
fed
with
me
so
must
they
with
me
to
bed
though
my
lord
would
not
permit
that
i
should
pass
the
night
in
the
now
all
this
i
did
to
befool
them
that
would
have
held
me
for
a
fool
and
this
sure
conclusion
did
i
make
that
the
most
gracious
god
doth
lend
and
impart
to
every
man
in
his
station
to
which
he
hath
called
him
so
much
wit
as
he
hath
need
of
there
to
maintain
himself
yea
and
moreover
that
many
do
vainly
imagine
doctors
though
they
be
or
not
that
they
alone
be
men
of
wit
and
they
only
fit
for
every
trade
whereas
there
be
as
many
good
fish
in
the
sea
yet
discourseth
of
the
wondrous
memory
of
some
and
the
forgetfulness
of
others
now
when
i
awaked
next
morning
were
both
my
becalfed
bedfellows
up
and
away
so
i
rose
up
likewise
and
when
the
adjutant
came
to
fetch
away
the
keys
to
open
the
town
gates
out
i
slipped
to
my
pastor
and
to
him
i
told
all
that
had
happened
to
me
as
well
in
heaven
as
in
hell
so
when
he
saw
that
it
vexed
my
conscience
that
i
should
deceive
so
many
folk
and
specially
my
master
whereas
i
pretended
to
be
a
fool
why
upon
that
point
says
he
thou
needest
not
to
trouble
thyself
this
foolish
world
will
be
befooled
and
if
they
have
left
thee
thy
wits
so
use
thou
those
same
wits
to
thine
own
advantage
and
imagine
to
thyself
as
if
thou
like
to
the
ph
oe
nix
hast
been
newly
born
from
folly
to
understanding
through
fire
and
so
to
a
new
human
life
yet
know
thou
withal
thou
art
not
yet
out
of
the
wood
but
with
risk
of
thy
reason
hast
slipped
into
this
fool
cap
yea
and
these
times
be
so
out
of
joint
that
none
can
know
whether
thou
yet
escape
without
loss
of
thy
life
for
a
man
can
run
quickly
into
hell
but
to
get
out
again
doth
need
a
deal
of
puffing
and
blowing
and
thou
art
not
yet
no
not
by
a
long
way
man
enough
to
escape
the
danger
that
lies
before
thee
as
well
thou
mightest
suppose
so
wilt
thou
have
need
of
more
foresight
and
wit
than
in
those
days
when
thou
knewest
not
what
reason
or
unreason
was
bide
thou
thy
time
and
wait
on
the
turn
of
the
tide
now
was
his
manner
of
speaking
different
from
what
it
had
been
and
that
because
i
believe
he
had
read
it
in
my
countenance
that
i
fancied
myself
to
be
somewhat
since
i
had
with
such
masterly
deceit
and
art
slipped
through
the
net
nay
i
gathered
this
from
his
face
that
he
was
sick
and
tired
of
me
for
his
looks
shewed
it
and
indeed
what
part
had
he
in
me
with
that
i
changed
my
discourse
also
and
busied
myself
to
give
him
great
thanks
for
the
excellent
remedies
which
he
had
imparted
to
me
for
the
preserving
of
my
wits
yea
and
i
made
him
impossible
promises
to
repay
him
all
that
my
debt
to
him
demanded
now
this
tickled
him
and
brought
him
again
to
a
different
humour
wherein
he
bepraised
his
medicine
and
told
me
simonides
of
melos
had
invented
an
art
which
metrodorus
of
skepsis
had
perfected
and
that
not
without
great
pains
whereby
he
could
teach
men
at
the
repeating
of
a
single
word
to
recount
all
that
they
had
ever
heard
or
read
and
such
a
thing
said
he
were
not
possible
without
medicines
to
strengthen
the
head
such
as
he
had
ministered
to
me
yea
thought
i
my
good
master
parson
yet
have
i
read
in
thine
own
books
when
i
dwelt
with
my
hermit
a
different
tale
of
that
wherein
the
skepsian
mnemonic
did
consist
yet
was
i
crafty
enough
to
hold
my
peace
for
if
i
must
speak
truth
now
first
when
i
must
be
counted
a
fool
that
i
became
and
more
guarded
in
my
talk
so
the
pastor
continued
and
told
me
how
cyrus
could
call
every
one
of
his
soldiers
by
his
right
name
how
lucius
scipio
could
do
the
like
with
every
citizen
of
rome
and
how
cineas
pyrrhus
ambassador
on
the
very
day
after
he
came
to
rome
could
repeat
in
their
order
the
names
of
all
the
senators
and
nobles
mithridates
the
king
of
pontus
said
he
had
in
his
realm
men
speaking
languages
to
all
of
which
he
could
minister
judgment
in
their
own
tongue
yea
and
talk
with
each
separately
so
too
the
learned
greek
charmides
could
tell
a
man
what
each
would
know
out
of
all
the
books
in
a
whole
library
if
he
had
but
read
them
once
through
lucius
seneca
could
say
names
in
order
if
they
were
once
recited
before
him
and
as
ravisius
tells
could
repeat
verses
spoken
by
scholars
from
the
last
back
to
the
first
so
esdras
knew
the
five
books
of
moses
by
heart
and
could
dictate
the
same
word
by
word
to
the
scribes
themistocles
in
one
year
did
learn
the
persian
speech
and
crassus
in
asia
could
talk
the
five
separate
dialects
of
the
greek
language
and
in
each
administer
the
law
to
his
subjects
julius
cæsar
could
at
the
same
time
read
dictate
and
give
audiences
the
holy
jerome
knew
both
hebrew
chaldee
greek
persian
median
arabic
and
latin
and
the
eremite
antonius
knew
the
whole
bible
by
heart
only
from
hearing
it
read
and
so
we
know
of
a
certain
corsican
that
he
could
hear
men
names
recited
and
thereafter
repeat
them
in
proper
order
and
all
this
i
tell
thee
said
he
further
that
thou
mayest
not
hold
it
for
an
impossible
thing
that
a
man
memory
should
be
excellently
strengthened
and
maintained
even
as
it
may
on
the
other
hand
be
in
many
ways
weakened
and
even
altogether
destroyed
for
in
man
there
is
no
faculty
so
fleeting
as
that
of
memory
for
by
reason
of
sickness
terror
fear
or
trouble
and
grief
it
either
vanisheth
away
or
loseth
a
great
part
of
its
virtue
so
do
we
read
of
a
learned
man
at
athens
that
after
a
stone
had
fallen
on
his
head
he
forgot
all
he
had
ever
learned
even
to
his
alphabet
so
too
another
by
reason
of
sickness
came
to
this
that
he
forgot
his
own
servant
name
and
messala
corvinus
knew
not
his
own
name
though
aforetime
he
had
a
good
memory
and
a
priest
who
had
sucked
blood
from
his
own
veins
thereupon
forgot
how
to
read
and
write
yet
otherwise
kept
his
memory
and
when
after
a
year
time
he
had
again
drunken
of
the
same
blood
at
the
same
place
and
the
same
time
could
again
write
and
read
so
if
a
man
eat
brains
is
said
he
will
fall
into
such
a
craze
and
strong
delusion
as
if
he
himself
were
turned
into
a
bear
as
is
shewn
by
the
example
of
a
spanish
nobleman
who
having
eaten
of
it
ran
wild
in
the
woods
and
could
believe
nought
else
but
that
he
was
a
bear
my
good
simplicissimus
had
thy
master
but
known
this
art
thou
mightest
well
have
been
changed
into
a
bear
like
callisto
rather
than
into
a
bull
like
jupiter
the
pastor
told
me
much
more
of
the
same
sort
gave
me
more
of
his
medicament
and
instructed
me
as
to
my
carriage
for
the
time
to
come
so
with
that
i
betook
myself
home
again
and
with
me
more
than
one
hundred
boys
which
all
ran
after
me
and
again
cried
after
me
like
calves
insomuch
that
my
master
who
was
now
risen
ran
to
the
window
and
when
he
saw
so
many
fools
all
at
once
was
so
gracious
as
to
laugh
heartily
thereat
crooked
praise
of
a
proper
lady
now
no
sooner
was
i
come
into
the
house
but
i
must
forthwith
to
the
parlour
for
there
were
noble
ladies
with
my
lord
which
desired
much
to
see
and
to
hear
his
new
fool
there
i
appeared
and
stood
like
a
dummy
whereupon
she
whom
i
had
before
caught
at
the
dance
took
occasion
to
say
she
had
been
told
this
calf
could
speak
but
now
she
did
plainly
perceive
was
not
true
whereto
i
made
answer
i
had
also
heard
apes
could
not
speak
but
now
could
plainly
hear
was
not
so
what
says
my
lord
opinest
thou
then
that
these
ladies
be
apes
so
i
answered
be
they
not
so
already
yet
they
soon
will
be
for
who
knoweth
how
things
will
go
yea
i
myself
had
never
expected
to
become
a
calf
and
yet
am
i
that
same
then
my
lord
would
ask
me
whereby
i
could
tell
that
these
ladies
should
become
apes
so
i
answered
him
our
ape
here
carrieth
his
hinder
parts
naked
but
these
ladies
do
so
carry
their
bosom
which
other
maidens
be
wont
to
cover
ah
rogue
saith
my
lord
thou
beest
but
a
foolish
calf
and
as
thou
art
so
thou
talkest
for
these
ladies
do
of
purpose
shew
what
is
worth
men
while
to
gaze
upon
whereas
the
poor
ape
goeth
naked
for
sheer
want
of
clothing
and
now
be
thou
quick
to
make
good
that
wherein
thou
hast
offended
else
will
we
so
bastinado
thee
and
so
hunt
thee
to
thy
with
dogs
as
men
use
to
do
with
calves
that
know
not
how
to
behave
themselves
yet
let
us
hear
if
thou
canst
praise
a
lady
as
is
becoming
so
i
looked
upon
the
lady
from
head
to
foot
and
again
from
foot
to
head
and
gazed
upon
her
so
fixedly
and
so
lovingly
as
i
would
take
her
to
wife
and
at
last
sir
said
i
i
see
clearly
where
the
fault
lieth
for
the
rascal
tailor
is
the
cause
of
all
the
villain
hath
left
those
parts
which
should
cover
the
neck
and
the
breast
below
in
the
skirts
and
therefore
do
these
so
trail
behind
the
botcher
should
have
his
hand
hewn
off
that
can
tailor
no
better
than
this
and
lady
quoth
i
to
her
be
rid
of
him
or
he
will
shame
you
and
have
a
care
that
you
do
deal
with
my
dad
tailor
which
same
was
hight
master
powle
for
he
could
fashion
fine
plaited
gowns
for
my
mammy
our
ann
and
our
ursula
and
all
cut
even
round
about
below
so
did
they
never
drag
in
the
mud
like
yours
nay
and
ye
can
not
believe
what
fine
clothes
he
would
make
for
the
hussies
so
says
my
lord
were
now
thy
father
ann
and
thy
father
ursula
handsomer
than
these
ladies
nay
said
i
my
lord
that
may
not
be
this
young
maiden
hath
hair
as
yellow
as
sulphur
and
the
parting
of
her
hair
so
white
and
smooth
as
though
one
had
cut
therefrom
yea
and
her
hair
so
sweetly
done
up
in
rolls
that
it
is
like
unto
yea
and
as
if
one
had
hanged
upon
each
side
of
her
head
a
pound
of
candles
or
a
dozen
of
sausages
look
you
now
what
a
smooth
fair
brow
she
hath
is
it
not
rounder
than
a
and
whiter
than
a
dead
man
skull
that
has
hung
long
on
the
gallows
in
wind
and
rain
is
pity
indeed
that
her
tender
skin
is
so
stained
by
for
when
people
see
this
who
understand
not
such
things
surely
they
will
think
this
lady
had
the
king
evil
which
is
wont
to
produce
such
a
scaly
humour
and
this
were
surely
pity
for
look
upon
those
sparkling
eyes
they
shine
as
black
as
did
the
soot
on
my
dad
chimney
for
that
did
use
to
shine
so
terribly
when
our
ann
stood
there
before
it
with
a
wisp
of
straw
to
warm
the
room
as
if
fire
were
therein
enough
to
set
the
world
in
a
blaze
her
cheeks
be
rosy
enough
yet
not
so
red
as
the
red
garters
with
which
the
swabian
waggoners
at
ulm
did
truss
up
their
breeches
yet
the
bright
red
which
she
hath
on
her
lips
doth
far
surpass
the
colour
of
those
garters
and
if
she
speak
or
laugh
i
pray
my
masters
give
heed
thereto
then
can
one
see
in
her
mouth
two
rows
of
teeth
so
orderly
and
so
sugary
as
if
they
were
with
one
snip
cut
out
of
a
white
turnip
oh
lovely
creature
i
can
not
believe
that
any
one
should
feel
pain
if
thou
shouldst
bite
him
therewith
so
too
her
neck
is
as
white
as
curdled
milk
and
her
bosom
which
lieth
beneath
of
like
colour
and
oh
my
masters
look
upon
her
hands
and
fingers
they
be
so
slender
so
long
so
slim
so
supple
and
so
cunning
as
for
all
the
world
like
a
gipsy
fingers
ready
to
thrust
into
any
man
pockets
and
there
go
with
that
there
arose
such
a
laughter
that
none
could
hear
me
nor
i
talk
so
i
took
french
leave
and
off
i
went
for
i
would
be
mocked
by
others
so
long
as
i
would
and
no
longer
discourseth
of
naught
but
heroes
and
famous
artists
thereafter
followed
the
midday
meal
whereat
i
again
did
good
service
for
now
had
i
made
it
my
purpose
to
rebuke
all
follies
and
to
chastise
all
vanities
to
which
end
my
present
condition
was
excellent
well
fitted
for
no
guest
was
too
exalted
for
me
to
reprove
and
upbraid
his
vices
and
if
there
were
any
that
shewed
displeasure
then
was
he
laughed
out
of
countenance
by
the
rest
or
else
my
master
would
demonstrate
to
him
that
no
wise
man
is
wont
to
be
vexed
at
a
fool
as
to
the
mad
ensign
which
was
my
worst
enemy
him
i
put
on
the
rack
at
once
yet
the
first
who
at
my
lord
nod
did
answer
me
reasonably
was
the
secretary
for
when
i
called
him
a
and
asked
what
title
then
had
our
first
father
adam
thou
talkest
answered
he
like
an
unreasoning
calf
for
thou
knowest
not
how
after
our
first
parents
different
folk
lived
in
the
world
which
by
rare
virtues
such
as
wisdom
manly
deeds
of
arms
and
invention
of
useful
arts
did
in
such
wise
ennoble
themselves
and
their
family
that
they
by
others
were
exalted
above
all
earthly
things
yea
even
above
the
stars
to
be
gods
and
wert
thou
a
man
or
hadst
thou
at
least
like
a
man
read
the
histories
thou
wouldst
understand
the
difference
that
lies
between
men
and
so
wouldst
thou
gladly
grant
to
each
his
title
of
honour
but
since
thou
art
but
a
calf
and
so
neither
worthy
nor
capable
of
human
honour
thou
talkest
of
this
matter
like
a
stupid
calf
and
grudgest
to
the
noble
human
race
that
wherein
it
can
rejoice
so
i
answered
i
was
once
a
man
as
much
as
thou
and
i
have
read
pretty
much
also
and
so
can
i
judge
that
thou
either
understandest
not
this
business
aright
or
art
for
thine
own
advantage
compelled
to
speak
otherwise
than
as
thou
knowest
for
tell
me
what
deeds
so
noble
and
what
arts
so
fine
have
ever
been
devised
as
to
be
enough
to
give
nobility
to
a
whole
family
for
hundreds
of
years
after
the
death
of
these
great
heroes
and
craftsmen
did
not
the
strength
of
the
heroes
and
the
wisdom
and
high
understanding
of
the
craftsmen
die
with
them
and
if
thou
seest
not
this
and
if
the
qualities
of
the
parents
do
descend
to
their
children
then
must
i
believe
thy
father
was
a
stockfish
and
thy
mother
a
plaice
oho
answered
the
secretary
if
the
matter
is
to
be
settled
by
our
reviling
of
each
other
then
can
i
cast
in
thy
teeth
thy
father
was
but
a
clownish
peasant
of
the
spessart
and
though
in
thy
home
and
in
thy
family
there
be
many
famous
blockheads
yet
thou
hast
made
thyself
yet
lower
seeing
that
thou
art
become
an
unreasoning
calf
so
i
answered
thou
art
right
is
even
that
that
that
i
would
maintain
namely
that
the
virtues
of
the
parents
descend
not
always
to
the
children
and
that
therefore
the
children
be
not
always
worthy
of
their
parent
titles
of
honour
for
me
it
is
no
shame
to
have
become
a
calf
seeing
that
in
such
case
i
have
the
honour
to
follow
the
great
king
nebuchadnezzar
who
knoweth
whether
it
may
not
please
god
that
i
like
him
may
again
become
a
man
yea
and
a
far
greater
one
than
my
dad
yet
do
i
praise
those
only
that
by
their
own
virtues
do
make
themselves
nobles
let
it
be
so
for
the
sake
of
argument
said
the
secretary
that
the
children
should
not
always
inherit
the
titles
of
their
parents
yet
thou
must
acknowledge
that
they
are
worthy
of
all
praise
which
do
earn
their
nobility
by
a
good
conduct
and
if
that
be
so
it
followeth
that
we
do
rightly
honour
the
children
for
the
parents
sake
since
the
apple
falleth
not
far
from
the
tree
and
who
would
not
honour
in
the
descendants
of
alexander
the
great
if
such
there
were
to
hand
their
ancient
forefather
high
courage
in
the
wars
for
this
man
shewed
in
his
youth
his
desire
for
fighting
in
that
he
wept
though
not
yet
able
to
bear
arms
grieving
lest
his
father
might
conquer
all
and
leave
him
nothing
to
subdue
did
not
he
before
the
thirtieth
year
of
his
age
overcome
all
the
world
and
wish
for
another
to
conquer
did
not
he
in
a
battle
against
the
indians
when
he
was
deserted
by
his
men
for
sheer
rage
sweat
blood
and
was
he
not
so
terrible
to
look
upon
as
though
he
were
all
begirt
with
flames
of
fire
that
even
the
savages
must
flee
before
him
in
battle
who
would
not
esteem
him
higher
and
nobler
than
other
men
of
whom
quintus
curtius
tells
that
his
breath
was
like
perfume
and
his
sweat
like
musk
and
that
his
dead
body
smelt
of
precious
spiceries
here
could
i
cite
the
case
of
julius
cæsar
and
pompeius
of
whom
the
one
besides
the
victories
which
he
won
in
the
civil
wars
did
fifty
times
engage
in
pitched
battles
and
defeated
and
slew
men
while
the
other
besides
the
taking
of
ships
from
the
pirates
did
from
the
alps
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
spain
capture
and
subdue
cities
and
towns
lucius
siccius
the
roman
people
tribune
was
engaged
in
pitched
battles
and
did
eight
times
conquer
them
that
challenged
him
he
could
shew
scars
on
his
body
and
those
all
in
front
and
none
behind
with
nine
did
he
enter
rome
in
their
triumphs
which
they
did
clearly
earn
by
their
courage
yea
and
manlius
capitolinus
honour
in
war
were
no
less
had
he
not
at
the
end
of
his
life
himself
abased
his
fame
for
he
too
could
shew
scars
without
counting
that
he
once
did
alone
save
the
capitol
with
all
its
treasures
from
the
french
what
of
hercules
the
strong
and
theseus
and
the
rest
whose
undying
praise
it
is
impossible
both
to
describe
and
to
tell
of
should
not
these
be
honoured
in
their
descendants
but
i
will
pass
over
war
and
weapons
and
turn
to
the
arts
which
though
they
seem
to
make
less
noise
in
the
world
yet
do
achieve
great
fame
for
the
masters
of
them
what
skill
do
we
find
in
zeuxis
which
by
his
ingenious
brain
and
skilful
hand
did
deceive
the
very
birds
of
the
air
and
likewise
in
apelles
who
did
paint
a
venus
so
natural
so
fine
so
exquisite
and
in
all
features
so
nice
and
so
delicate
that
all
bachelors
did
fall
in
love
with
her
doth
not
plutarch
tell
us
how
archimedes
did
draw
with
one
hand
and
by
a
single
rope
through
the
midst
of
the
marketplace
at
syracuse
a
great
ship
laden
with
merchants
ware
as
if
he
had
but
led
a
packhorse
by
the
bridle
which
thing
not
twenty
oxen
to
say
nothing
of
two
hundred
calves
like
thee
could
have
effected
and
should
not
this
honest
craftsman
be
endowed
with
a
title
of
honour
fitted
to
his
art
this
archimedes
made
a
mirror
wherewith
he
could
set
on
fire
an
warship
in
and
who
would
not
praise
him
which
first
did
invent
letters
yea
who
would
not
exalt
him
far
above
all
artists
who
devised
the
noble
and
for
all
the
world
useful
art
of
printing
if
ceres
was
accounted
a
goddess
because
she
is
said
to
have
invented
agriculture
and
the
grinding
of
corn
why
were
it
not
fair
that
others
should
have
their
praise
with
titles
of
honour
allowed
them
yet
in
truth
it
mattereth
little
whether
thou
thou
stupid
calf
canst
take
such
things
into
thy
unreasoning
bullock
brain
or
not
for
is
with
thee
as
with
the
dog
which
lay
in
the
manger
and
would
not
let
the
ox
eat
of
the
hay
yet
could
not
enjoy
the
same
himself
thou
art
capable
of
no
honour
and
for
that
very
cause
thou
grudgest
such
to
those
that
do
deserve
it
with
all
this
i
found
myself
sorely
bestead
yet
made
answer
these
mighty
deeds
were
indeed
highly
to
be
praised
were
they
not
accomplished
with
the
destruction
and
damage
of
other
men
but
what
manner
of
praise
is
this
which
is
stained
with
the
bloodshed
of
so
many
innocents
and
what
manner
of
nobility
that
which
is
achieved
and
won
by
the
ruin
of
so
many
thousand
other
folk
and
as
concerns
the
arts
what
be
they
save
merely
vanities
and
follies
yea
they
be
as
vain
idle
and
unprofitable
as
the
title
of
honour
which
might
come
to
any
man
from
these
craftsmen
for
they
do
but
serve
the
greed
or
the
lust
or
the
luxury
or
the
corruption
of
others
like
to
those
vile
guns
which
lately
i
beheld
on
their
yea
and
well
could
we
spare
both
printing
and
writing
according
to
the
sentence
and
opinion
of
that
holy
man
who
held
that
the
whole
wide
world
was
book
enough
for
him
wherein
to
study
the
wonders
of
his
creator
and
thereupon
to
recognise
the
almighty
power
of
god
of
the
toilsome
and
dangerous
office
of
a
governor
then
my
lord
would
also
have
his
jest
with
me
and
said
i
do
well
perceive
that
because
thou
trustest
not
thyself
to
be
of
gentle
birth
therefore
thou
despisest
the
honourable
titles
of
gentility
sir
answered
i
if
i
could
at
this
very
hour
enter
upon
your
place
of
honour
yet
would
i
not
take
it
my
lord
laughed
and
said
that
i
believe
for
for
the
ox
his
oaten
straw
is
well
enough
but
an
thou
hadst
a
high
spirit
such
as
hearts
of
gentles
should
have
then
wouldst
thou
with
zeal
aspire
to
high
honours
and
dignities
i
for
my
part
count
it
no
small
thing
that
fortune
raises
me
above
my
fellows
then
did
i
sigh
and
o
toilsome
felicity
said
i
sir
i
assure
you
ye
are
the
most
miserable
man
in
hanau
how
so
how
so
calf
said
my
lord
give
me
thy
reasons
for
such
i
find
not
in
myself
so
i
answered
if
you
know
not
and
feel
not
that
you
are
governor
in
hanau
and
with
how
many
cares
and
uneasiness
in
that
account
burdened
then
either
the
devouring
thirst
of
honour
blinds
you
or
else
are
you
of
iron
and
quite
insensible
ye
have
is
true
the
right
to
command
and
whosoever
comes
within
your
ken
the
same
must
obey
you
but
do
they
serve
ye
for
naught
are
ye
not
all
men
servant
must
ye
not
specially
take
care
for
each
and
all
see
ye
are
girded
round
with
foes
and
the
safeguarding
of
this
stronghold
depends
on
you
alone
ever
must
ye
be
devising
how
to
do
some
damage
to
your
opposites
and
therein
must
ever
be
on
your
guard
that
your
plans
be
not
spied
upon
must
ye
not
often
stand
on
guard
like
a
common
sentinel
besides
ye
must
ever
be
concerned
that
there
be
no
failure
in
money
ammunition
food
and
folk
and
for
that
reason
be
ever
holding
the
whole
land
to
contribution
by
continual
exactions
and
extortions
send
ye
your
men
out
to
such
an
end
then
is
robbery
plunder
stealing
burning
and
murder
their
highest
task
even
now
of
late
they
have
plundered
orb
captured
braunfels
and
laid
staden
in
ashes
thence
is
true
they
brought
back
booty
but
ye
have
laid
on
them
a
grievous
responsibility
before
god
i
grant
this
that
those
enjoyments
which
accompany
thine
honour
do
please
thee
well
but
knowest
thou
who
will
enjoy
such
treasures
as
doubtless
thou
gatherest
and
granted
that
such
riches
remain
thine
whereof
a
man
may
doubt
yet
must
thou
leave
them
in
this
world
and
takest
nothing
with
thee
but
the
sin
whereby
thou
hast
gained
them
and
even
if
thou
hast
the
good
luck
to
enjoy
thy
booty
yet
thou
dost
but
spend
the
sweat
and
blood
of
the
poor
who
do
now
in
misery
suffer
want
or
even
perish
and
die
of
hunger
how
often
do
i
see
that
thy
thoughts
by
reason
of
the
cares
of
thine
office
are
distracted
hither
and
thither
while
i
and
other
calves
do
sleep
in
peace
without
any
care
and
if
thou
dost
not
so
it
shall
cost
thee
thy
head
if
aught
be
overlooked
that
should
have
been
provided
for
the
preservation
of
thy
subject
people
and
this
fortress
look
you
i
am
raised
above
such
cares
and
so
knowing
that
i
do
owe
the
debt
of
death
to
nature
i
fear
not
lest
an
enemy
should
storm
my
stall
or
lest
i
should
have
with
pains
to
fight
for
life
if
i
die
young
so
am
i
delivered
from
the
toilsome
life
of
a
but
for
thee
men
lay
snares
in
a
thousand
fashions
and
therefore
is
thy
life
naught
but
a
continual
care
and
sleeplessness
for
thou
must
fear
both
friend
and
foe
which
be
ever
devising
to
cheat
thee
of
thy
life
or
thy
money
or
thy
reputation
or
thy
command
or
somewhat
else
whatever
it
be
even
as
thou
thinkest
to
do
by
others
the
enemy
doth
attack
thee
openly
and
thy
supposed
friends
do
secretly
envy
thee
thy
good
luck
and
even
as
regards
thy
subjects
art
thou
in
no
manner
of
safety
i
say
naught
of
this
that
daily
thy
burning
desires
do
torment
thee
and
drive
thee
hither
and
thither
whilst
thou
plannest
to
gain
for
thyself
still
greater
name
and
fame
to
rise
higher
in
rank
to
gather
greater
riches
to
play
the
enemy
a
trick
to
surprise
this
or
that
place
in
a
word
to
do
wellnigh
everything
that
may
vex
others
and
prove
harmful
to
thine
own
soul
and
grievous
to
god
majesty
yea
and
the
worst
is
this
that
thou
art
so
spoiled
by
thy
flatterers
that
thou
knowest
not
thyself
but
art
by
them
so
captivated
and
drugged
that
thou
canst
not
see
the
dangerous
way
thou
goest
for
all
that
thou
doest
they
say
is
right
and
all
thy
vices
are
by
them
turned
into
virtues
and
so
proclaimed
thy
cruelty
is
to
them
stern
justice
and
when
thou
plunderest
land
and
folk
thou
art
a
brave
soldier
say
they
and
do
urge
thee
on
to
others
harm
that
they
may
keep
in
thy
favour
and
fill
their
purses
too
thou
malingerer
said
my
lord
who
taught
thee
so
to
preach
good
my
lord
answered
i
say
i
not
truly
that
thou
art
so
spoiled
by
thine
and
sycophants
that
already
thou
art
past
help
whereas
contrariwise
other
folk
do
soon
detect
thy
faults
and
condemn
thee
not
only
in
high
and
mighty
matters
but
find
enough
to
blame
in
thee
in
small
things
which
are
of
little
account
and
of
this
hast
thou
not
examples
enough
in
the
case
of
great
men
of
old
time
so
the
lacedaemonians
railed
at
their
own
lycurgus
for
walking
with
his
head
bowed
the
romans
deemed
it
a
foul
fault
in
scipio
that
he
snored
so
loud
in
his
sleep
it
seemed
to
them
an
ugly
fault
in
pompey
that
he
did
scratch
himself
but
with
one
finger
at
cæsar
they
mocked
for
wearing
his
girdle
awry
and
the
good
cato
was
slandered
for
eating
too
greedily
with
both
jaws
at
once
yea
the
carthaginians
spoke
evil
of
hannibal
for
going
with
his
breast
bare
and
uncovered
how
think
ye
now
my
dear
master
think
ye
i
would
change
places
with
one
that
besides
twelve
or
thirteen
boon
companions
flatterers
and
parasites
hath
more
than
one
hundred
yea
is
like
enough
more
than
ten
thousand
both
open
and
secret
foes
slanderers
and
malicious
enviers
besides
what
happiness
what
pleasure
and
what
joy
can
such
a
head
have
under
whose
care
protection
and
guard
so
many
men
do
live
not
a
duty
laid
upon
thee
to
watch
for
all
thy
folk
to
care
for
them
and
listen
to
each
one
complaints
and
grievances
were
that
not
of
itself
troublesome
enough
even
though
thou
hadst
neither
foes
nor
secret
enemies
i
can
see
well
enough
how
hard
is
for
thee
and
yet
how
many
grievances
thou
must
endure
and
good
my
lord
what
in
the
end
will
be
thy
reward
tell
me
what
hast
thou
for
it
all
if
thou
canst
not
say
then
suffer
the
grecian
demosthenes
to
tell
thee
who
after
he
had
bravely
and
loyally
furthered
and
defended
the
common
weal
and
rights
of
the
athenians
was
contrary
to
all
law
and
justice
banished
the
land
and
driven
into
miserable
exile
as
an
so
socrates
was
requited
with
poison
and
hannibal
so
ill
rewarded
by
his
countrymen
that
he
must
wander
in
the
world
as
a
poor
wretched
outlaw
yea
the
greeks
repaid
lycurgus
in
such
fashion
that
he
was
stoned
and
had
an
eye
beaten
out
do
thou
therefore
keep
thy
high
office
to
thyself
with
the
reward
thou
wilt
have
from
it
seek
not
to
share
it
with
me
for
even
if
all
go
well
with
thee
yet
hast
thou
naught
to
carry
home
with
thee
but
an
ill
conscience
and
if
thou
art
minded
to
obey
that
conscience
then
wilt
thou
be
quickly
deposed
from
thy
commands
as
incapable
for
all
the
world
as
if
thou
too
wert
become
a
stupid
calf
while
i
thus
spake
the
rest
of
the
company
looked
hard
upon
me
and
wondered
much
that
i
should
be
able
to
hold
such
discourse
which
as
they
openly
confessed
would
have
taxed
the
wits
of
a
man
of
sense
if
he
had
been
forced
so
to
speak
without
preparation
of
the
sense
and
knowledge
of
certain
unreasoning
animals
so
i
ended
my
discourse
thus
therefore
said
i
my
excellent
master
will
i
not
change
with
thee
for
indeed
i
have
no
call
to
do
so
since
the
brook
affords
me
a
healthy
drink
instead
of
thy
costly
wines
and
he
who
allowed
me
to
be
turned
into
a
calf
will
also
in
such
wise
know
how
to
bless
the
fruits
of
the
earth
to
my
use
that
they
be
to
me
as
to
nebuchadnezzar
no
unfitting
provision
for
food
and
sustenance
even
so
hath
nature
provided
me
with
a
good
coat
of
fur
while
as
for
thee
often
thou
loathest
thy
meat
thy
wine
splitteth
thy
head
and
soon
will
bring
thee
into
one
sickness
or
another
then
my
lord
answered
i
know
not
what
i
have
in
thee
meseemeth
thou
art
for
a
calf
far
too
wise
nay
i
do
surmise
thou
hast
under
that
clad
thyself
with
a
with
that
i
made
as
if
i
were
angry
and
said
do
ye
men
think
then
that
we
beasts
be
all
fools
that
may
ye
not
imagine
i
do
maintain
that
if
older
beasts
could
speak
as
well
as
i
that
they
would
tell
you
a
very
different
story
if
ye
deem
we
are
so
stupid
then
tell
me
who
hath
taught
the
wild
the
jays
the
blackbirds
and
the
partridges
to
purge
themselves
with
and
doves
and
fowls
with
dandelions
who
teacheth
cat
and
dog
to
eat
the
dewy
grass
when
they
desire
to
purge
a
full
belly
who
hath
taught
the
tortoise
to
heal
a
bite
with
hemlock
or
the
stag
when
he
is
shot
to
have
recourse
to
the
dictamnus
or
calamint
who
taught
the
weasel
to
use
the
rue
when
she
will
fight
with
bat
or
snake
who
maketh
the
wild
boar
to
know
the
ivy
and
the
bear
the
mandrake
and
saith
to
them
it
is
their
medicine
who
giveth
the
swallow
to
understand
that
she
should
heal
her
fledglings
dim
eyes
with
chelidonium
who
did
instruct
the
snake
to
eat
of
fennel
when
she
will
cast
her
slough
and
heal
her
darkened
eyes
who
teacheth
the
stork
to
purge
himself
the
pelican
to
let
himself
blood
and
the
bear
to
get
himself
scarified
by
bees
nay
i
might
almost
say
ye
men
have
learned
your
arts
and
sciences
from
us
beasts
ye
eat
and
drink
yourselves
to
death
and
that
we
beasts
do
never
do
lion
or
wolf
when
he
is
by
way
of
growing
too
fat
then
he
fasteth
till
again
he
is
thin
active
and
healthy
and
which
party
dealeth
most
wisely
herein
yea
above
and
beyond
all
this
consider
the
fowls
of
the
air
regard
the
various
architecture
of
their
cunning
nests
and
inasmuch
as
all
your
labours
can
never
imitate
them
therefore
ye
must
acknowledge
they
be
both
wiser
and
more
ingenious
than
ye
men
yourselves
who
telleth
to
our
summer
birds
when
they
should
come
to
us
for
the
spring
and
hatch
their
young
or
for
the
autumn
when
they
should
again
betake
themselves
from
us
to
warmer
climes
who
teacheth
them
they
must
choose
a
to
that
end
who
leadeth
them
or
sheweth
them
the
way
do
ye
men
lend
them
perchance
a
compass
that
they
fall
not
out
by
the
way
nay
my
good
friends
they
do
know
the
way
without
your
help
and
how
long
they
must
spend
therein
and
when
they
must
depart
from
this
place
and
the
other
and
therefore
have
no
need
of
your
compass
nor
your
almanack
further
behold
the
industrious
spider
whose
web
is
wellnigh
a
miracle
look
if
you
find
a
singly
knot
in
all
her
weaving
what
hunter
or
fisher
hath
taught
her
how
to
spread
her
net
and
when
she
hath
laid
that
net
to
catch
her
prey
to
set
herself
either
in
the
furthest
corner
or
else
full
in
the
centre
ye
men
do
admire
the
raven
of
whom
plutarchus
writeth
that
he
threw
into
a
vessel
that
was
half
full
of
water
so
many
stones
that
the
water
rose
until
he
could
conveniently
drink
thereof
what
would
ye
do
if
ye
were
to
dwell
among
the
beasts
and
there
behold
all
the
rest
of
their
dealings
their
doings
and
their
then
at
all
events
would
ye
acknowledge
was
plain
that
all
beasts
had
somewhat
of
especial
natural
vigour
and
virtue
in
all
their
desires
and
instincts
as
being
now
prudent
now
strenuous
now
gentle
now
timid
now
fierce
for
your
learning
and
instruction
each
knoweth
the
other
they
discern
each
from
other
they
seek
after
that
which
is
useful
to
them
flee
from
what
is
harmful
avoid
danger
gather
together
what
is
necessary
for
their
sustenance
yea
and
at
times
do
befool
you
men
yourselves
therefore
have
many
ancient
philosophers
seriously
pondered
of
such
matters
and
have
not
been
ashamed
to
question
and
to
dispute
whether
unreasoning
brutes
might
not
have
understanding
but
i
care
not
to
speak
further
of
these
matters
get
ye
to
the
bees
and
see
how
they
make
wax
and
honey
and
then
come
again
and
tell
me
how
ye
think
of
it
of
various
matters
which
whoever
will
know
must
either
read
them
or
have
them
read
to
him
thereupon
various
judgments
were
pronounced
upon
me
by
my
guests
the
secretaries
were
of
opinion
i
should
be
counted
a
fool
because
i
esteemed
myself
a
reasoning
beast
and
because
they
that
had
a
tile
or
two
slipped
and
yet
seemed
to
themselves
wise
were
the
most
complete
and
comical
fools
of
all
others
said
if
possible
to
drive
out
of
me
the
idea
that
i
was
a
calf
or
one
could
persuade
me
i
was
again
turned
into
a
man
i
should
surely
be
held
reasonable
or
at
least
sane
enough
but
my
lord
himself
said
i
hold
him
for
a
fool
because
he
telleth
every
man
the
truth
so
shamelessly
yet
are
his
speeches
so
ordered
that
they
belong
to
no
fool
now
all
this
they
spake
in
latin
that
i
might
not
understand
then
he
asked
me
had
i
studied
while
i
was
yet
a
man
i
answered
i
knew
not
what
study
was
but
dear
sir
said
i
further
tell
me
what
manner
of
things
are
these
studs
with
which
men
study
speakest
thou
perchance
of
the
balls
with
which
men
bowl
then
answered
he
they
called
the
mad
ensign
what
will
ye
with
the
fellow
hath
a
devil
is
possessed
is
sure
the
devil
talking
through
his
mouth
and
on
that
my
lord
took
occasion
to
ask
me
since
i
had
been
turned
into
a
calf
whether
i
still
was
accustomed
to
pray
like
other
men
and
trusted
to
go
to
heaven
surely
answered
i
yet
have
i
my
immortal
human
soul
which
as
thou
canst
easily
believe
will
not
lightly
desire
to
come
to
hell
again
specially
since
i
fared
therein
so
evilly
once
before
i
am
but
changed
as
once
was
nebuchadnezzar
and
in
god
good
time
i
might
well
become
a
man
again
and
i
hope
thou
mayst
said
my
lord
with
a
pretty
deep
sigh
whereupon
i
might
easily
judge
that
he
repented
him
of
having
allowed
me
to
be
driven
mad
but
let
us
hear
he
went
on
how
art
thou
wont
to
pray
so
i
kneeled
down
and
raised
my
eyes
and
hands
to
heaven
in
good
hermit
fashion
and
because
my
repentance
which
i
had
perceived
touched
my
heart
with
exceeding
comfort
i
could
not
refrain
my
tears
and
so
to
outward
appearance
prayed
with
deepest
reverence
after
the
paternoster
for
all
christendom
for
my
friends
and
my
enemies
and
that
god
would
vouchsafe
to
me
so
to
live
in
this
world
that
i
might
be
worthy
to
praise
him
in
eternal
bliss
my
hermit
had
taught
me
such
a
prayer
in
devout
and
words
at
that
some
onlookers
were
also
nigh
to
weeping
for
they
had
great
pity
for
me
yea
my
own
eyes
were
full
of
water
after
dinner
my
lord
sends
for
the
pastor
and
to
him
he
told
all
that
i
had
uttered
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
was
concerned
lest
all
was
not
well
with
me
and
perchance
the
devil
had
a
finger
in
the
pie
seeing
that
at
first
i
had
shewn
myself
altogether
simple
and
ignorant
yet
now
could
utter
things
to
make
men
wonder
the
pastor
who
knew
my
qualities
better
than
any
other
answered
that
should
have
been
thought
on
before
was
allowed
to
make
me
a
fool
for
men
said
he
were
made
in
the
image
of
god
and
with
such
and
especially
with
such
tender
youth
one
must
not
make
sport
as
with
beasts
yet
would
he
never
believe
was
permitted
to
the
evil
spirit
to
interfere
seeing
that
i
had
ever
commended
myself
to
god
with
fervent
prayer
yet
if
against
all
likelihood
such
a
thing
were
decreed
and
permitted
then
had
men
a
sore
account
to
answer
for
before
god
inasmuch
as
there
would
scarcely
be
greater
sin
than
for
one
man
to
rob
another
of
his
reason
and
thus
withdraw
him
from
the
praise
and
service
of
god
whereto
he
was
chiefly
created
i
gave
ye
beforehand
my
assurance
said
he
that
he
had
wit
enough
but
that
he
could
not
fit
himself
to
the
world
was
caused
by
this
that
he
was
brought
up
first
with
his
father
a
rough
peasant
and
then
with
your
in
the
wilderness
in
all
simplicity
had
folk
had
but
a
little
patience
with
him
at
first
he
would
with
time
have
learned
a
better
carriage
he
was
but
a
simple
child
such
as
the
world
knew
not
yet
do
i
not
doubt
he
can
again
be
brought
to
his
right
mind
if
we
can
but
take
from
him
this
fantasy
and
bring
him
to
believe
no
longer
that
he
was
turned
into
a
calf
we
read
of
one
which
did
firmly
believe
he
was
changed
into
an
earthen
pot
and
would
beseech
his
friends
to
put
him
high
on
a
shelf
lest
he
should
be
trodden
on
and
broken
another
did
imagine
he
was
a
cock
and
in
his
infirmity
crowed
both
day
and
night
and
yet
another
fancied
he
was
already
dead
and
a
wandering
spirit
and
therefore
would
partake
of
no
medicine
nor
food
nor
drink
till
a
wise
physician
hired
two
fellows
which
gave
themselves
out
likewise
to
be
spirits
yet
hearty
drinkers
who
joined
themselves
to
him
and
persuaded
him
that
nowadays
spirits
were
wont
to
eat
and
drink
whereby
he
was
brought
to
his
senses
yea
i
myself
had
a
sick
peasant
in
my
parish
who
when
i
visited
him
complained
to
me
he
had
three
or
four
barrels
of
water
in
his
body
and
could
he
be
rid
of
that
he
trusted
to
be
well
again
and
begged
me
either
to
have
him
ripped
up
that
the
water
might
run
away
or
have
him
hung
up
in
the
smoke
to
dry
it
up
so
i
spoke
him
fair
and
persuaded
him
i
could
draw
off
the
water
from
him
in
another
fashion
and
with
that
i
took
a
tap
such
as
we
use
for
wine
and
bound
a
strip
of
pig
guts
to
it
and
the
other
end
i
fastened
to
the
bung
hole
of
a
great
puncheon
which
to
that
end
i
had
had
filled
with
water
then
i
pretended
as
if
i
had
stuck
the
tap
into
his
belly
which
he
had
had
swathed
in
rags
lest
it
should
burst
then
i
let
the
water
run
out
of
the
puncheon
through
tubes
whereat
the
poor
creature
rejoiced
heartily
and
throwing
away
his
rags
was
in
a
few
days
whole
again
again
one
that
imagined
he
had
all
manner
of
bits
and
the
like
in
his
body
was
in
this
wise
cured
for
his
physician
having
given
him
a
strong
purge
conveyed
such
things
into
the
so
that
the
fellow
must
needs
believe
he
was
rid
of
them
by
the
purging
so
too
they
tell
of
one
madman
that
believed
his
nose
was
so
long
that
it
reached
to
the
ground
for
him
they
hung
a
sausage
to
his
nose
and
cut
it
away
by
little
and
little
till
they
came
to
the
real
nose
who
as
soon
as
he
felt
the
knife
touch
his
flesh
cried
out
the
nose
was
in
its
right
shape
again
and
our
good
simplicissimus
can
therefore
be
cured
even
as
were
these
of
whom
i
have
spoken
all
this
can
i
believe
answered
my
master
only
this
gives
me
concern
that
he
was
before
so
ignorant
and
now
can
talk
of
all
matters
and
that
in
such
perfect
fashion
as
one
can
not
easily
find
even
among
persons
older
more
practised
and
better
read
than
he
is
for
he
hath
told
me
of
many
properties
of
beasts
and
described
mine
own
person
so
exactly
as
he
had
been
all
his
life
in
the
busy
world
so
that
i
must
needs
wonder
and
hold
his
speeches
wellnigh
for
an
oracle
or
a
warning
of
god
sir
answered
the
pastor
this
may
well
be
true
and
yet
natural
i
know
that
he
is
well
read
seeing
that
he
as
well
as
his
hermit
went
through
all
my
books
which
i
had
and
which
were
not
few
and
because
the
lad
hath
a
good
memory
and
is
now
at
leisure
in
his
mind
and
forgetful
of
his
own
person
therefore
he
can
utter
what
aforetime
he
stored
in
his
brain
and
therefore
i
do
cherish
the
firm
hope
that
with
time
he
may
again
be
brought
to
right
reason
in
this
wise
the
pastor
left
the
governor
between
hope
and
fear
and
me
and
my
cause
he
defended
in
the
best
way
and
gained
for
me
days
of
happiness
and
for
himself
by
the
way
access
to
the
governor
their
crowning
resolve
was
this
to
deal
with
me
for
a
time
quietly
and
that
the
pastor
did
more
for
his
own
sake
than
mine
for
by
going
to
and
fro
and
acting
as
if
he
bestirred
himself
for
my
sake
and
felt
great
care
for
me
he
gained
the
governor
favour
who
gave
him
office
and
made
him
chaplain
to
the
garrison
which
in
those
hard
times
was
no
small
matter
neither
did
i
grudge
it
him
how
simplicissimus
led
the
life
of
a
nobleman
and
how
the
croats
robbed
him
of
this
when
they
stole
himself
so
from
this
time
forward
i
possessed
in
full
the
favour
grace
and
love
of
my
lord
of
which
i
can
boast
with
truth
nought
i
wanted
to
complete
my
good
fortune
but
that
my
calfskin
was
too
much
and
my
years
too
little
though
i
knew
it
not
myself
besides
the
pastor
would
not
yet
have
me
brought
to
my
senses
but
it
seemed
to
him
not
yet
time
neither
as
yet
profitable
for
his
interest
but
my
lord
seeing
my
taste
for
music
had
me
to
learn
it
and
hired
for
me
an
excellent
whose
art
i
presently
well
understood
and
in
this
excelled
him
that
i
could
sing
to
the
lute
better
than
he
so
could
i
serve
my
lord
for
his
pleasure
for
his
pastime
delight
and
admiration
likewise
all
the
officers
shewed
me
their
respect
and
goodwill
the
richest
burghers
sent
me
gratifications
and
the
household
like
the
soldiers
wished
me
well
because
they
saw
how
well
inclined
my
master
was
to
me
one
treated
me
here
another
there
for
they
knew
that
often
jesters
have
more
power
with
their
masters
than
honest
men
and
to
this
end
were
all
their
gifts
for
some
gave
to
me
lest
i
should
slander
them
others
for
that
very
reason
namely
that
i
should
slander
others
for
their
sake
in
which
manner
i
put
together
a
pretty
sum
of
money
which
for
the
most
part
i
handed
to
the
pastor
for
i
knew
not
yet
to
what
end
it
could
be
used
and
as
none
dared
look
at
me
askance
so
from
this
time
forward
i
had
no
jealousy
care
or
trouble
to
encounter
with
all
my
thoughts
i
gave
to
my
music
and
to
devising
how
i
might
courteously
point
out
to
one
and
the
other
his
failings
so
i
grew
like
a
pig
in
clover
and
my
strength
of
body
increased
palpably
soon
could
one
see
that
i
was
no
longer
starving
my
body
in
the
wood
with
water
and
acorns
and
and
roots
and
herbs
but
that
over
a
good
meal
i
found
the
rhenish
wine
and
the
hanau
to
my
taste
which
was
indeed
in
those
miserable
times
to
be
accounted
a
great
favour
of
god
for
at
that
time
all
germany
was
aflame
with
war
and
harried
by
hunger
and
pestilence
and
hanau
itself
besieged
by
the
enemy
all
which
disturbed
me
not
in
the
least
but
after
the
raising
of
the
siege
my
master
designed
to
make
a
present
of
me
either
to
cardinal
richelieu
or
duke
bernhard
of
weimar
for
besides
that
he
hoped
to
earn
great
thanks
for
the
gift
he
said
plainly
was
not
possible
for
him
to
bear
the
sight
of
me
longer
because
i
presented
to
him
in
that
fool
raiment
the
face
of
his
lost
sister
to
whom
i
grew
more
like
every
day
in
that
the
pastor
opposed
him
for
he
held
that
the
time
was
not
yet
come
when
he
was
to
do
a
miracle
and
make
me
a
reasonable
creature
again
and
therefore
counselled
the
governor
he
should
have
a
couple
of
calfskins
prepared
and
put
on
two
other
boys
and
thereafter
appoint
some
third
person
who
in
the
shape
of
a
physician
prophet
or
conjurer
should
strip
me
and
the
said
two
boys
and
pretend
he
could
make
beasts
into
men
and
men
into
beasts
in
this
manner
i
might
be
restored
and
without
great
pains
might
be
brought
to
believe
i
had
like
others
again
become
a
man
which
proposal
when
the
governor
approved
the
pastor
told
me
what
he
had
agreed
with
my
master
and
easily
persuaded
me
to
consent
thereto
but
envious
fortune
would
not
so
easily
free
me
of
my
fool
clothes
nor
leave
me
longer
to
enjoy
my
noble
life
of
pleasure
for
while
tanners
and
tailors
were
already
at
work
on
the
apparel
that
appertained
to
this
comedy
i
was
even
then
sporting
with
some
other
boys
on
the
ice
in
front
of
the
ramparts
and
there
some
one
i
know
not
who
brought
upon
us
a
party
of
croats
which
seized
upon
us
all
set
us
upon
certain
riderless
which
they
had
just
stolen
and
carried
us
all
off
together
is
true
they
were
at
first
in
doubt
whether
to
take
me
with
them
or
not
till
at
last
one
said
in
bohemian

him
on

the
colonel
speaks

he
will
have
sport
with
him
so
i
must
to
horse
and
must
learn
how
a
single
unlucky
hour
can
rob
one
of
all
welfare
and
so
separate
him
from
all
luck
and
happiness
that
all
his
life
he
must
bear
the
consequences
of
simplicissimus
life
with
the
troopers
and
what
he
saw
and
learned
among
the
croats
though
is
true
the
hanauers
raised
an
alarm
at
once
sallied
forth
on
horseback
and
for
a
while
detained
the
croats
and
harassed
them
with
skirmishing
yet
could
they
get
from
them
none
of
their
booty
for
being
light
troops
they
escaped
very
cleverly
and
took
their
way
to
büdingen
where
they
baited
and
delivered
to
the
burghers
there
the
rich
hanauers
sons
to
put
to
ransom
and
there
sold
their
stolen
horses
and
other
wares
from
thence
they
decamped
again
before
it
was
even
fully
night
let
alone
day
again
and
rode
hard
through
the
büdingen
forest
into
the
of
fulda
and
seized
on
the
way
all
they
could
carry
with
them
for
robbery
and
plunder
hindered
them
not
in
the
least
in
their
swift
march
like
the
devil
that
can
do
mischief
as
he
flies
and
the
same
evening
they
arrived
in
the
of
hirschfeld
where
they
had
their
quarters
with
great
store
of
plunder
and
this
was
divided
but
me
their
colonel
corpes
took
as
his
share
in
the
service
of
this
master
all
appeared
to
me
as
unpleasing
and
wellnigh
barbarous
the
dainties
of
hanau
had
changed
into
coarse
black
bread
and
stringy
beef
or
by
good
luck
a
bit
of
stolen
pork
wine
and
beer
were
now
turned
to
water
and
instead
of
a
bed
i
must
be
content
to
lie
by
the
horses
in
the
straw
instead
of
that
which
had
delighted
all
men
now
must
i
at
times
creep
under
the
table
like
the
other
lads
howl
like
a
dog
and
suffer
myself
to
be
pricked
with
their
spurs
which
was
for
me
but
a
poor
jest
instead
of
my
promenades
at
hanau
i
must
now
ride
on
foraging
parties
groom
horses
and
clean
out
their
stalls
now
this
same
foraging
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
attacking
of
villages
with
great
pains
and
labour
yea
often
with
danger
to
life
and
limb
and
there
threshing
grinding
baking
stealing
and
taking
all
that
can
be
found
harrying
and
spoiling
the
farmers
and
shaming
of
their
maids
their
wives
and
their
daughters
and
if
the
poor
peasants
did
murmur
or
were
bold
enough
to
rap
a
forager
or
two
over
the
fingers
finding
them
at
such
work
and
at
that
time
were
many
such
guests
in
hesse
they
were
knocked
on
the
head
if
they
could
be
caught
or
if
not
their
houses
went
up
in
smoke
to
heaven
now
my
master
had
no
wife
for
campaigners
of
his
kidney
be
not
wont
to
take
ladies
with
them
no
page
no
chamberlain
no
cook
but
on
the
other
hand
a
whole
troop
of
grooms
and
boys
which
waited
both
on
him
and
his
horse
nor
was
he
himself
ashamed
to
saddle
his
own
horse
or
give
him
a
feed
he
slept
ever
on
straw
or
on
the
bare
ground
and
covered
himself
with
a
fur
coat
so
it
came
about
that
one
could
often
see
great
fleas
or
lice
walk
upon
his
clothes
of
which
he
was
not
ashamed
at
all
but
would
laugh
if
any
one
pocked
one
out
short
hair
he
had
but
a
broad
switzer
beard
which
served
his
turn
well
for
he
was
wont
to
disguise
himself
as
a
peasant
and
so
to
go
yet
though
as
i
have
said
he
kept
no
great
household
yet
was
he
by
his
own
folk
and
others
that
knew
him
honoured
loved
and
feared
never
were
we
at
rest
but
now
here
now
there
now
we
attacked
and
now
we
were
attacked
never
for
a
moment
were
we
idle
in
damaging
the
hessians
resources
nor
on
his
part
did
melander
leave
us
in
peace
but
cut
off
many
a
trooper
and
sent
him
prisoner
to
cassel
this
restless
life
was
not
to
my
liking
and
often
i
did
wish
myself
back
in
hanau
yet
in
vain
my
greatest
torment
was
that
i
could
not
talk
with
the
men
and
must
suffer
myself
to
be
kicked
plagued
beaten
and
driven
by
each
and
all
and
the
chiefest
pastime
that
my
colonel
had
was
that
i
should
sing
to
him
in
german
and
puff
my
cheeks
like
the
other
which
is
true
happened
but
seldom
yet
then
i
got
me
such
a
shower
of
buffets
that
the
red
blood
flowed
and
i
soon
had
enough
at
last
i
began
to
do
somewhat
of
cooking
and
to
keep
my
master
weapons
clean
whereon
he
laid
great
stress
for
i
was
as
yet
useless
for
foraging
and
this
answered
so
well
that
in
the
end
i
gained
my
master
favour
insomuch
that
he
had
a
new
fool
coat
of
calfskins
made
for
me
with
much
greater
asses
ears
than
i
wore
before
now
as
my
master
palate
was
not
delicate
i
needed
the
less
skill
for
my
cookery
yet
because
i
was
too
often
without
salt
grease
or
seasoning
i
wearied
of
this
employ
also
and
therefore
devised
day
and
night
how
i
might
most
cleverly
escape
and
that
the
more
because
now
springtime
so
to
accomplish
this
i
undertook
the
work
of
clearing
away
the
guts
of
sheep
and
oxen
with
heaps
of
which
our
quarters
were
surrounded
so
that
they
should
no
longer
cause
so
foul
a
smell
and
this
the
colonel
approved
and
being
busied
with
this
i
stayed
outside
altogether
and
when
it
was
dark
slipped
away
to
the
nearest
wood
how
simplicissimus
found
goodly
spoils
and
how
he
became
a
thievish
brother
of
the
woods
yet
to
all
appearance
my
condition
grew
worse
and
worse
the
further
i
went
yea
so
grievous
that
i
conceived
i
was
born
but
for
misfortune
for
i
was
but
a
few
miles
distant
from
the
croats
when
i
was
caught
by
highwaymen
which
without
doubt
thought
they
had
captured
in
me
somewhat
of
value
for
by
reason
of
the
dark
night
they
could
not
see
my
fool
coat
and
forthwith
bade
two
of
their
number
take
me
to
their
in
the
forest
so
when
they
had
brought
me
thither
and
still
one
fellow
would
at
once
have
money
from
me
to
which
end
he
laid
aside
his
gauntlets
and
his
and
began
to
search
me
asking
who
art
thou
hast
thou
money
yet
so
soon
as
he
was
ware
of
my
hairy
clothing
and
the
long
ears
on
my
cap
which
he
took
for
horns
and
at
the
same
time
perceived
the
shining
sparks
which
the
hides
of
beasts
do
commonly
shew
when
they
are
stroked
in
the
dark
he
was
so
terrified
that
he
shrank
into
himself
that
did
i
presently
mark
so
before
he
could
recover
himself
or
devise
aught
i
stroked
down
my
hide
with
both
hands
to
such
good
purpose
that
it
glittered
as
if
i
had
been
stuffed
full
of
burning
sulphur
and
then
i
answered
him
in
a
terrible
voice
i
am
the
devil
and
i
will
break
thy
neck
and
thy
fellow
too
which
so
terrified
both
that
they
fled
through
the
thicket
as
swiftly
as
if
the
fires
of
hell
were
pursuing
them
yea
though
they
dashed
themselves
against
sticks
and
stones
and
trunks
of
trees
and
yet
more
often
tumbled
they
were
up
again
with
all
speed
so
they
went
on
till
i
could
hear
them
no
longer
while
i
laughed
so
loud
that
it
echoed
through
the
whole
forest
which
without
doubt
in
that
dark
wilderness
was
horrible
to
hear
now
when
i
would
be
gone
i
tripped
over
the
musket
and
that
i
took
for
myself
for
already
i
had
learned
from
the
croats
how
to
manage
then
as
i
walked
on
i
came
upon
a
knapsack
which
like
my
coat
was
made
of
that
too
i
took
up
and
found
that
a
well
stored
with
powder
and
shot
and
all
appurtenance
hung
below
it
all
this
i
hung
on
me
took
the
musket
on
my
shoulder
like
a
soldier
and
hid
myself
not
far
off
in
a
thicket
intending
to
sleep
there
awhile
but
at
daybreak
came
the
whole
crew
to
the
spot
searching
for
the
musket
that
was
lost
and
the
knapsack
so
i
pricked
up
mine
ears
like
a
fox
and
kept
still
as
a
mouse
and
when
they
found
nothing
they
mocked
at
those
two
that
had
fled
before
me
shame
said
they
ye
craven
fools
shame
on
your
very
heart
that
ye
could
so
suffer
yourselves
to
be
frighted
and
chased
and
have
your
arms
taken
by
a
single
man
yet
one
fellow
swore
the
devil
should
take
him
if
not
the
devil
himself
his
horns
and
his
hairy
hide
he
had
well
perceived
and
the
other
waxed
angry
and
said
it
may
have
been
the
devil
or
his
dam
if
i
had
but
my
knapsack
back
again
then
one
of
them
whom
i
took
to
be
their
captain
answered
him
and
says
he
what
thinkest
thou
the
devil
should
do
with
thy
knapsack
and
thy
musket
i
would
wager
my
neck
the
rascal
that
ye
so
shamefully
let
go
hath
taken
both
with
him
yet
another
took
the
contrary
part
and
said
it
might
well
happen
that
some
countrymen
had
since
passed
that
way
who
had
found
the
things
and
taken
them
and
in
the
end
all
approved
this
and
believed
by
all
the
band
they
had
had
the
devil
himself
in
their
hands
especially
because
the
fellow
that
would
search
me
in
the
darkness
not
only
swore
the
same
with
horrid
oaths
but
also
was
able
powerfully
to
describe
and
to
magnify
the
rough
and
glittering
skin
and
the
two
horns
as
certain
signs
of
the
devil
quality
nay
i
do
conceive
that
had
i
shewn
myself
again
unawares
the
whole
band
would
have
run
so
at
last
when
they
had
sought
long
enough
and
had
found
nothing
they
went
on
their
way
again
but
i
opened
the
knapsack
to
make
my
breakfast
thereof
and
at
the
first
trial
i
brought
out
a
pouch
in
which
were
some
ducats
and
that
i
rejoiced
thereat
none
need
question
yet
may
the
reader
be
assured
that
the
knapsack
pleased
me
yet
more
than
this
fine
sum
of
money
since
i
found
it
well
stored
with
provisions
and
as
such
are
far
too
sparsely
strewn
among
common
soldiers
for
them
to
take
such
with
them
on
a
raid
i
judge
that
the
fellow
must
have
just
snapped
up
these
on
that
very
excursion
and
quickly
whipped
them
into
his
knapsack
that
he
might
not
be
compelled
to
share
them
with
the
rest
thereupon
i
made
a
cheerful
breakfast
and
found
too
a
merry
little
spring
at
which
i
refreshed
myself
and
counted
my
fine
ducats
and
if
my
life
depended
thereon
to
say
in
what
land
or
place
i
then
found
myself
i
could
not
tell
and
first
i
stayed
in
the
wood
as
long
as
my
food
lasted
with
which
i
dealt
right
sparingly
then
when
my
knapsack
was
empty
hunger
drove
me
to
the
farmers
houses
and
there
i
crept
by
night
into
cellar
and
kitchen
and
took
what
food
i
found
and
could
carry
off
and
this
i
conveyed
away
to
the
wildest
part
of
the
wood
and
so
i
led
a
hermit
life
as
before
save
that
i
stole
much
and
therefore
prayed
less
and
had
moreover
no
fixed
abode
but
wandered
now
here
now
there
was
well
for
me
indeed
that
it
was
now
the
beginning
of
summer
though
i
could
kindle
a
fire
with
my
musket
whenever
i
would
how
simplicissimus
was
present
at
a
dance
of
witches
during
these
my
wanderings
there
met
me
once
and
again
in
the
woods
different
who
at
all
times
fled
from
me
i
know
not
if
the
cause
was
that
they
were
by
reason
of
the
war
turned
so
timid
and
were
so
hunted
and
never
left
in
peace
in
one
place
or
whether
the
highwaymen
had
spread
abroad
in
the
land
the
adventure
they
had
had
with
me
so
that
all
which
saw
me
thereafter
believed
the
evil
one
was
of
a
truth
prowling
about
in
that
part
but
for
this
reason
i
must
needs
fear
lest
my
provisions
should
fail
and
so
i
be
brought
to
the
uttermost
misery
for
then
must
i
begin
again
to
eat
roots
and
herbs
to
which
i
was
no
longer
accustomed
as
i
pondered
on
this
i
heard
two
men
cutting
of
wood
which
rejoiced
me
mightily
so
i
followed
the
sound
of
the
blows
and
when
i
came
in
sight
of
the
men
i
took
a
handful
of
ducats
out
of
my
pouch
and
creeping
nearer
to
them
shewed
them
the
alluring
gold
and
cried
my
masters
if
ye
will
but
wait
for
me
i
will
give
you
this
handful
of
gold
but
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
and
my
gold
at
once
they
took
to
their
heels
and
left
their
mallets
and
wedges
together
with
their
bag
of
bread
and
cheese
with
this
i
filled
my
knapsack
and
so
betook
myself
back
to
the
wood
doubting
if
in
my
life
i
should
ever
come
to
the
company
of
men
again
so
after
long
pondering
thereupon
i
thought
who
knoweth
what
may
chance
to
thee
thou
hast
money
and
if
thou
comest
in
safety
with
it
to
honest
folk
thou
canst
live
on
it
a
long
while
so
it
came
into
my
head
to
sew
it
up
and
to
that
end
i
made
out
of
my
asses
ears
which
made
the
folk
so
fly
from
me
two
armlets
and
companying
my
hanau
ducats
with
those
of
the
banditti
i
packed
all
together
into
these
armlets
and
bound
them
on
mine
arms
above
the
elbow
and
now
as
i
had
thus
secured
my
treasure
i
attacked
the
farms
again
and
got
from
them
what
i
needed
and
what
i
could
snap
up
and
though
i
was
but
simple
yet
i
was
sly
enough
never
to
come
a
second
time
to
a
place
where
i
had
stolen
anything
and
therefore
was
i
very
lucky
in
my
thefts
and
was
never
caught
pilfering
it
fell
out
at
the
end
of
may
as
i
sought
to
replenish
my
store
by
my
customary
yet
forbidden
tricks
and
to
that
end
had
crept
into
a
farmyard
that
i
found
my
way
into
the
kitchen
but
soon
perceived
that
there
were
people
still
awake
and
here
note
that
where
dogs
were
i
wisely
stayed
away
so
i
set
the
kitchen
door
which
opened
into
the
yard
ajar
that
if
any
danger
threatened
i
could
at
once
escape
and
stayed
still
as
a
mouse
till
i
might
expect
the
people
would
go
to
bed
but
meanwhile
i
took
note
of
a
crack
that
was
in
the
that
led
to
the
thither
i
crept
to
see
if
the
folk
would
not
soon
go
to
rest
but
my
hopes
were
deceived
for
they
had
but
now
put
on
their
clothes
and
in
place
of
a
light
there
stood
a
sulphurous
blue
flame
on
a
bench
by
the
light
of
which
they
anointed
sticks
brooms
pitchforks
chairs
and
benches
and
on
these
flew
out
of
the
window
one
after
another
at
this
i
was
horribly
amazed
and
felt
great
terror
yet
as
being
accustomed
to
greater
horrors
and
moreover
in
my
whole
life
having
never
heard
nor
read
of
witches
i
thought
not
much
of
this
and
that
chiefly
because
was
all
so
done
in
such
stillness
but
when
all
were
gone
i
betook
myself
also
to
the
and
devising
what
i
could
take
with
me
and
where
to
find
it
in
such
meditation
sat
me
down
upon
a
bench
whereon
i
had
hardly
sat
down
when
i
and
the
bench
together
flew
straight
out
of
the
window
and
left
my
gun
and
knapsack
which
i
had
laid
aside
as
pay
for
that
magical
ointment
now
my
sitting
down
my
departure
and
my
descent
were
all
in
one
moment
for
i
came
methought
in
a
trice
to
a
great
crowd
of
people
but
it
may
be
that
from
fear
i
took
no
count
how
long
i
took
for
this
long
journey
these
folk
were
dancing
of
a
wondrous
dance
the
like
of
which
i
saw
never
in
my
life
for
they
had
taken
hands
and
formed
many
rings
within
one
another
with
their
backs
turned
to
each
other
like
the
pictures
of
the
three
graces
so
that
all
faced
outwards
the
inmost
ring
was
of
some
seven
or
eight
persons
the
second
of
as
many
again
the
third
contained
more
than
the
first
two
put
together
and
so
on
so
that
in
the
outermost
ring
there
were
over
two
hundred
persons
and
because
one
ring
danced
towards
the
right
and
the
next
towards
the
left
i
could
not
see
how
many
rings
they
formed
nor
what
was
in
the
midst
around
which
they
danced
yet
all
looked
monstrous
strange
because
all
the
heads
wound
in
and
out
so
comically
my
bench
that
brought
me
alighted
beside
the
minstrels
which
stood
outside
the
rings
all
round
the
dancers
of
which
minstrels
some
had
instead
of
flutes
clarinets
and
shawms
nothing
but
adders
vipers
and
on
which
they
blew
right
merrily
some
had
cats
into
whose
breech
they
blew
and
fingered
on
the
tail
which
sounded
like
to
bagpiper
others
fiddled
on
horses
skulls
as
on
the
finest
violins
and
others
played
the
harp
upon
a
cow
skeleton
such
as
lie
in
the
yards
one
was
there
too
that
had
a
bitch
under
his
arm
on
whose
tail
he
fiddled
and
fingered
on
the
teats
and
throughout
all
the
devils
trumpeted
with
their
noses
till
the
whole
wood
resounded
therewith
and
when
the
dance
was
at
an
end
that
whole
hellish
crew
began
to
rave
to
scream
to
rage
to
howl
to
rant
to
ramp
and
to
roar
as
they
were
all
mad
and
lunatic
and
now
can
any
man
think
into
what
terror
and
fear
i
fell
in
this
tumult
there
came
to
me
a
fellow
that
had
under
his
arm
a
monstrous
toad
full
as
big
as
a
kettledrum
whose
guts
were
dragged
out
through
its
breech
and
stuffed
into
its
mouth
which
looked
so
filthy
that
i
was
fit
to
vomit
at
it
lookye
simplicissimus
says
he
i
know
thou
beest
a
good
let
us
hear
a
tune
from
thee
but
i
was
so
terrified
because
the
rogue
called
me
by
name
that
i
fell
flat
and
with
that
terror
i
grew
dumb
and
fancied
i
lay
in
an
evil
dream
and
earnestly
i
prayed
in
my
heart
i
might
awake
from
it
now
the
fellow
with
the
toad
whom
i
stared
at
all
the
time
went
on
thrusting
his
nose
out
and
in
like
a
till
at
last
it
hit
me
on
the
breast
so
that
i
was
near
choked
then
in
a
wink
was
all
and
i
so
dismayed
at
the
heart
that
i
fell
on
the
ground
and
crossed
myself
a
good
hundred
times
or
more
doth
prove
that
no
man
can
lay
to
charge
that
he
doth
draw
the
long
bow
now
since
there
be
some
and
indeed
some
learned
folk
among
them
that
believe
not
that
there
be
witches
and
sorcerers
still
less
that
they
can
fly
from
place
to
place
in
the
air
therefore
am
i
sure
there
will
be
some
to
say
that
here
the
good
simplicissimus
draws
the
long
bow
with
such
folk
i
can
not
argue
for
since
brag
is
become
no
longer
an
art
but
nowadays
wellnigh
the
commonest
trade
i
may
not
deny
that
i
could
practise
this
if
i
would
for
an
i
could
not
i
were
the
veriest
fool
but
they
that
deny
the
witches
gallop
to
be
true
let
them
but
think
of
simon
the
magician
which
was
by
the
evil
spirit
raised
aloft
into
the
air
and
at
the
prayer
of
peter
fell
again
to
earth
nicolas
remigius
which
was
an
honest
learned
and
understanding
man
who
in
the
duchy
of
lorraine
caused
to
be
burned
a
good
many
more
than
a
of
witches
tells
us
of
john
of
hembach
that
his
mother
which
same
was
a
witch
in
the
sixteenth
year
of
his
age
took
him
with
her
to
their
assembly
that
he
might
play
to
them
as
they
danced
for
he
had
learned
to
play
the
fife
that
to
that
end
he
mounted
on
a
tree
piped
to
them
and
earnestly
gazed
upon
the
dancers
and
that
maybe
because
he
marvelled
so
at
it
all
but
at
last
god
help
us
says
he
whence
cometh
all
this
mad
and
foolish
folk
and
hardly
had
he
said
that
word
when
down
he
fell
from
the
tree
twisted
his
shoulder
and
called
for
help
but
there
was
nobody
there
but
himself
when
this
was
noised
abroad
most
held
it
for
a
fable
till
a
little
after
catherine
prévost
was
arrested
for
witchcraft
who
had
been
at
the
said
dance
so
she
confessed
all
even
as
it
had
happened
save
that
she
knew
naught
of
the
cry
that
hembach
had
uttered
majolus
tells
us
of
a
servant
that
had
been
too
common
with
his
mistress
and
of
an
adulterer
that
took
his
paramour
and
smeared
himself
with
the
same
and
so
both
came
to
the
witches
sabbath
so
likewise
they
tell
of
a
that
arose
early
to
grease
his
waggon
but
because
he
had
taken
the
wrong
pot
of
ointment
in
the
dark
that
waggon
rose
into
the
air
and
must
be
dragged
down
again
olaus
magnus
tells
us
of
hading
king
of
denmark
how
he
being
driven
from
his
kingdom
by
rebels
journeyed
far
over
the
sea
through
the
air
on
the
spirit
of
odin
which
had
turned
himself
to
the
shape
of
a
horse
so
do
we
know
well
enough
and
too
well
how
wives
and
wenches
in
bohemia
will
fetch
their
paramours
to
them
on
the
backs
of
goats
by
night
and
from
a
great
distance
and
what
torquemada
in
his
hexameron
relateth
of
his
schoolfellow
may
in
his
own
words
be
read
so
too
ghirlandus
speaketh
of
a
nobleman
which
when
he
marked
that
his
wife
anointed
herself
and
thereafter
flew
out
of
the
house
did
once
on
a
time
compel
her
to
take
him
with
her
to
the
sorcerers
assembly
and
when
they
feasted
there
and
there
was
no
salt
he
demanded
such
and
having
with
great
pains
gotten
it
did
cry
god
be
praised
here
cometh
the
salt
whereupon
the
lights
went
out
and
all
vanished
so
when
now
was
day
he
understood
from
the
shepherds
in
that
place
that
he
was
near
to
the
town
of
benevento
in
the
kingdom
of
naples
and
therefore
full
five
hundred
miles
from
his
home
and
therefore
though
he
was
rich
must
he
beg
his
way
home
whither
when
he
came
he
delated
his
wife
for
a
witch
before
the
magistrate
and
she
was
burned
how
doctor
faust
too
and
others
which
were
no
enchanters
could
journey
through
the
air
from
one
place
to
another
is
from
his
history
sufficiently
known
so
i
myself
knew
a
wife
and
a
maid
both
dead
at
this
time
of
writing
but
the
maid
father
yet
alive
which
maid
was
once
greasing
of
her
mistress
shoes
by
the
fire
and
when
she
had
finished
one
and
set
it
by
to
grease
the
other
lo
the
greased
one
flew
up
the
chimney
which
story
nevertheless
was
hushed
up
all
this
i
have
set
down
for
this
reason
only
that
men
may
believe
that
witches
and
wizards
do
in
truth
at
certain
seasons
in
their
proper
bodies
journey
to
these
their
assemblies
and
not
to
make
any
man
to
believe
that
i
as
i
have
told
you
went
myself
to
such
for
to
me
is
all
one
whether
a
man
believe
me
or
not
and
he
that
will
not
believe
may
devise
for
himself
another
way
for
me
to
have
come
from
the
lands
of
fulda
or
hirschfeld
for
i
know
not
myself
whither
i
had
wandered
in
the
woods
into
the
archbishopric
of
magdeburg
and
that
in
so
brief
a
space
of
time
how
simplicissimus
became
a
fool
again
as
he
had
been
a
fool
before
so
now
i
begin
my
history
again
with
this
that
i
assure
the
reader
that
i
lay
on
my
belly
till
was
at
least
broad
daylight
as
not
having
the
heart
to
stand
up
therewithal
i
doubted
whether
the
things
i
have
told
of
were
a
dream
or
not
and
though
i
was
yet
in
great
terror
yet
was
i
bold
enough
at
my
waking
for
i
deemed
i
could
be
in
no
worse
place
than
in
the
wild
woods
and
therein
i
had
spent
the
most
of
my
time
since
i
was
separated
from
my
dad
and
therefore
was
pretty
well
accustomed
thereto
now
it
was
about
nine
when
there
came
foragers
which
woke
me
up
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
perceived
i
was
in
the
open
field
so
they
had
me
with
them
to
certain
windmills
and
when
they
had
ground
their
corn
there
to
the
camp
before
magdeburg
where
i
fell
to
the
share
of
a
colonel
of
a
who
asked
me
what
was
my
story
and
what
manner
of
master
i
had
served
so
i
told
him
all
to
a
nicety
and
because
i
had
no
name
for
the
croats
i
did
but
describe
their
clothing
and
gave
examples
of
their
speech
and
told
how
i
escaped
from
them
yet
of
my
ducats
said
i
nought
and
what
i
told
of
my
journey
through
the
air
and
of
the
witches
dance
that
they
all
held
to
be
imagination
and
folly
and
that
especially
because
in
the
rest
of
my
discourse
i
seemed
to
talk
wildly
meanwhile
a
crowd
of
folk
gathered
round
me
for
one
fool
makes
a
thousand
and
among
them
was
one
that
the
year
before
had
been
made
prisoner
at
hanau
and
there
had
taken
service
yet
afterwards
had
come
back
to
the
emperor
army
who
knowing
me
again
said
at
once
hoho
is
the
commandant
calf
of
hanau
thereupon
the
colonel
questioned
him
further
but
the
fellow
knew
no
more
save
that
i
could
play
the
lute
well
and
that
i
had
been
captured
outside
the
walls
at
hanau
by
the
croats
of
colonel
corpes
regiment
and
moreover
that
the
said
commandant
had
been
vexed
at
losing
me
for
i
was
a
right
clever
fool
so
then
the
colonel
wife
sent
to
another
colonel
wife
that
could
play
well
upon
the
lute
and
therefore
always
had
one
by
her
and
begged
her
for
the
loan
of
it
which
when
it
came
she
handed
to
me
with
the
command
that
i
should
play
but
my
view
was
they
should
first
give
me
to
eat
for
an
empty
stomach
accorded
not
well
with
a
fat
one
such
as
the
lute
had
so
this
was
done
and
when
i
had
eaten
my
fill
and
drunk
a
good
draught
of
zerbst
beer
i
let
them
hear
what
i
could
do
both
with
my
voice
and
with
the
lute
and
therewithal
i
talked
gibberish
all
that
first
came
into
my
head
so
that
i
easily
persuaded
the
folk
to
believe
i
was
of
the
quality
that
my
apparel
represented
then
the
colonel
asked
me
whither
i
would
go
and
i
answering
was
all
one
to
me
we
agreed
thereupon
that
i
should
stay
with
him
and
be
his
page
yet
would
he
know
where
my
asses
ears
had
gone
yea
said
i
to
myself
an
thou
knewest
where
they
were
they
would
fit
thee
well
enough
yet
was
i
clever
enough
to
say
naught
of
their
properties
for
all
my
worldly
goods
lay
in
them
now
in
a
brief
space
i
was
well
known
to
all
both
in
the
emperor
and
the
elector
camp
but
specially
among
the
ladies
who
would
deck
my
hood
my
sleeves
and
my
ears
with
ribbons
of
all
colours
so
that
i
verily
believe
that
certain
fops
copied
therefrom
the
fashion
of
but
all
the
money
that
was
given
me
by
the
officers
that
i
liberally
gave
away
and
spent
all
to
the
last
farthing
drinking
it
away
with
jolly
companions
in
beer
of
hamburg
and
zerbst
which
liquors
pleased
me
well
and
besides
this
in
all
places
wheresoever
i
came
there
was
plenty
of
chance
of
spunging
but
when
my
colonel
procured
for
me
a
lute
of
my
own
for
he
trusted
to
have
me
ever
with
him
then
i
could
no
longer
rove
hither
and
thither
in
the
two
camps
but
he
appointed
for
me
a
governor
who
should
look
after
me
and
i
to
obey
him
and
this
was
a
man
after
mine
own
heart
for
he
was
quiet
discreet
learned
of
sufficient
conversation
yet
not
too
much
and
which
was
the
chief
matter
exceeding
well
read
and
full
of
all
arts
and
sciences
at
night
i
must
sleep
in
his
tent
and
by
day
i
might
not
go
out
of
his
sight
he
had
once
been
a
counsellor
and
minister
of
a
prince
and
indeed
a
rich
man
but
being
by
the
swedes
utterly
ruined
his
wife
dead
and
his
only
son
unable
to
continue
his
studies
for
want
of
money
and
therefore
serving
as
a
clerk
in
the
saxon
army
he
took
service
with
this
my
colonel
and
was
content
to
serve
as
a
lackey
to
wait
until
the
dangerous
chances
of
war
on
the
banks
of
the
elbe
should
change
and
so
the
sun
of
his
former
happiness
again
shine
upon
him
is
pretty
long
and
treats
of
playing
with
dice
and
what
hangs
thereby
now
because
my
governor
was
rather
old
than
young
therefore
could
he
not
sleep
all
the
night
through
and
that
was
the
cause
that
he
even
in
the
first
few
weeks
discovered
my
secret
namely
that
i
was
no
such
fool
as
i
gave
out
of
which
he
had
before
observed
somewhat
and
had
conceived
such
a
judgment
from
my
face
for
he
was
skilled
in
physiognomia
once
i
awoke
at
midnight
and
having
divers
thoughts
upon
my
life
and
its
strange
adventures
rose
up
and
by
way
of
gratitude
recounted
all
the
benefits
that
god
had
done
unto
me
and
all
the
dangers
from
which
he
had
rescued
me
then
i
lay
down
again
with
deep
sighing
and
slept
soundly
till
day
all
this
my
governor
heard
yet
made
as
if
he
were
sound
asleep
and
this
happened
several
nights
running
until
he
had
fully
convinced
himself
i
had
more
understanding
than
many
an
older
man
who
fancied
himself
to
be
somewhat
yet
he
spake
thereof
nought
to
me
in
our
hut
because
it
had
walls
too
thin
and
because
he
for
certain
reasons
would
not
have
it
that
as
yet
and
before
he
was
assured
of
my
innocence
any
one
else
should
know
this
secret
once
on
a
time
i
went
to
take
the
air
outside
the
camp
and
this
he
gladly
allowed
because
he
had
then
the
opportunity
to
come
to
look
for
me
and
so
the
occasion
to
speak
with
me
alone
so
as
he
wished
he
found
me
in
a
lonely
place
where
indeed
i
was
giving
audience
to
my
thoughts
and
says
he
good
and
dear
friend
is
because
i
seek
for
thy
welfare
that
i
rejoice
to
be
able
to
speak
with
thee
alone
i
know
thou
art
no
fool
as
thou
pretendest
and
that
thou
hast
no
desire
to
continue
in
this
miserable
and
despised
state
if
now
thou
holdest
thy
welfare
dear
and
wilt
trust
to
me
as
to
a
man
of
honour
and
so
canst
tell
me
plainly
the
condition
of
thy
fortunes
so
will
i
for
my
part
whenever
i
can
be
ready
with
word
and
deed
to
help
thee
out
of
this
fool
coat
so
thereupon
i
fell
upon
his
neck
and
so
carried
myself
as
he
had
been
a
prophet
to
release
me
from
my
fool
cap
and
sitting
both
down
upon
the
ground
i
told
him
my
whole
story
then
he
examined
my
hands
and
wondered
both
at
the
strange
events
which
had
befallen
me
and
those
which
were
to
come
yet
would
in
no
wise
counsel
me
to
lay
aside
my
fool
coat
in
haste
for
he
said
that
by
means
of
palmistry
he
could
see
that
my
fate
threatened
me
with
imprisonment
which
should
bring
me
danger
of
life
and
limb
so
i
thanked
him
for
his
good
will
and
his
counsel
and
asked
of
god
that
he
would
reward
him
for
his
good
faith
and
of
himself
that
he
would
be
and
ever
remain
my
true
friend
and
father
so
we
rose
up
and
came
to
the
where
men
tilt
with
the
dice
and
loudly
they
cursed
with
all
the
blood
and
thunder
wounds
and
damnation
that
they
could
lay
their
tongues
to
the
place
was
wellnigh
as
big
as
the
old
market
at
cologne
spread
with
cloaks
and
furnished
with
tables
and
those
full
of
gamesters
and
every
company
had
its
thieves
bones
on
which
they
hazarded
their
luck
for
share
their
money
they
must
and
give
it
to
one
and
take
it
from
another
so
likewise
every
cloak
or
table
had
its
coupier
croupier
i
should
have
said
and
might
well
have
said
cooperer
whose
office
was
to
be
judges
and
to
see
that
none
was
cheated
they
too
lent
the
cloaks
and
tables
and
dice
and
contrived
so
well
to
get
their
hire
out
of
the
winnings
that
they
generally
got
the
chief
share
yet
it
bred
them
no
advantage
for
commonly
they
gamed
it
away
again
or
when
it
was
best
laid
out
was
the
sutler
or
the
that
had
it
for
there
were
many
broken
heads
to
mend
at
these
fools
one
might
well
wonder
how
they
all
thought
to
win
which
was
impossible
even
if
they
had
played
at
another
risk
and
though
all
hoped
for
this
yet
the
cry
was
the
more
players
the
more
skill
for
each
thought
on
his
own
luck
and
so
it
happened
that
some
hit
and
some
missed
some
won
and
some
lost
thereupon
some
cursed
some
roared
some
cheated
and
others
were
jockeyed
whereat
the
winners
laughed
and
the
losers
gnashed
their
teeth
some
sold
their
clothes
and
all
they
valued
most
and
others
again
won
even
that
money
from
them
some
wanted
honest
dice
and
others
on
the
contrary
part
would
have
false
ones
and
brought
in
such
secretly
which
again
others
threw
away
broke
in
two
bit
with
their
teeth
and
tore
the
cloaks
among
the
false
dice
were
dutch
ones
that
one
must
cast
with
a
good
spin
for
these
had
the
sides
whereon
the
fives
and
sixes
were
as
sharp
as
the
back
of
the
wooden
horse
on
which
soldiers
be
punished
others
were
high
german
to
which
a
man
must
in
casting
give
the
bavarian
swing
some
were
of
light
above
and
heavy
below
others
were
loaded
with
quicksilver
or
lead
and
others
again
with
split
hairs
sponge
chaff
and
charcoal
some
had
sharp
corners
others
had
them
pared
quite
away
some
were
long
like
logs
and
some
broad
like
tortoises
all
which
kinds
were
made
but
for
cheating
and
what
they
were
made
for
that
they
did
whether
they
were
thrown
with
a
swing
or
trickled
on
to
the
board
and
no
coupling
of
them
was
of
any
avail
to
say
nothing
of
those
that
had
two
fives
or
two
sixes
or
on
the
other
hand
two
aces
or
two
deuces
with
these
thieves
bones
they
stole
filched
and
plundered
each
other
goods
which
they
themselves
perchance
had
stolen
or
at
least
with
danger
to
life
and
limb
or
other
grievous
trouble
and
labour
had
won
so
as
i
stood
there
and
looked
upon
the
and
the
gamesters
in
their
folly
my
governor
asked
me
how
the
thing
pleased
me
then
answered
i
that
men
can
so
grievously
curse
god
pleases
me
not
but
for
the
rest
i
leave
it
for
what
is
worth
as
a
matter
unknown
to
me
and
of
which
i
as
yet
understand
nought
know
then
said
my
governor
that
this
is
the
worst
and
vilest
place
in
the
whole
camp
for
here
men
seek
one
another
money
and
lose
their
own
in
doing
so
and
whoso
doth
but
set
a
foot
here
with
intent
to
play
hath
already
broken
the
tenth
commandment
which
saith
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbour
goods
and
says
he
an
thou
play
and
win
specially
by
deceit
and
false
dice
then
thou
transgressest
the
seventh
and
eighth
commandments
yea
it
may
well
happen
that
thou
committest
murder
on
him
from
whom
thou
hast
won
his
money
as
for
example
if
his
loss
is
so
great
that
by
reason
of
it
he
come
into
poverty
and
into
utter
need
and
recklessness
or
else
fall
into
other
foul
vices
nor
will
this
plea
help
thee
that
thou
sayest
did
risk
mine
own
and
won
honestly
thou
rogue
thou
camest
to
the
with
this
intent
to
grow
rich
through
another
loss
and
if
thou
lose
thou
art
not
excused
with
the
punishment
of
losing
thine
own
but
like
the
rich
man
in
the
parable
thou
must
answer
it
sorely
to
god
that
thou
so
uselessly
hast
squandered
that
which
he
lent
thee
for
the
support
of
thee
and
thine
whosoever
goeth
to
the
to
play
the
same
committeth
himself
to
the
danger
of
losing
therein
not
only
his
money
but
his
body
and
his
life
also
yea
what
is
most
terrible
of
all
there
can
he
lose
his
own
soul
i
tell
thee
this
as
news
my
friend
simplicissimus
because
thou
sayest
gaming
is
unknown
to
thee
that
thou
mayest
be
on
thy
guard
against
it
all
thy
life
long
so
i
answered
him
dear
sir
said
i
if
gaming
be
so
terrible
and
dangerous
a
thing
wherefore
do
our
superiors
allow
it
my
governor
answered
i
will
not
say
was
because
our
officers
themselves
take
part
therein
but
for
this
reason
that
the
soldiers
will
not
yea
can
not
do
without
it
for
whosoever
hath
once
given
himself
over
to
gaming
or
whomsoever
the
habit
or
rather
the
devil
of
play
hath
seized
upon
the
same
is
by
little
and
little
whether
he
win
or
lose
so
set
upon
it
that
he
can
easier
do
without
his
natural
sleep
than
that
as
we
see
that
some
will
rattle
the
dice
the
whole
night
through
and
will
neglect
the
best
of
food
and
drink
if
they
can
but
play
yea
even
if
they
must
go
home
shirtless
yet
this
gaming
hath
already
been
forbidden
at
divers
times
on
pain
of
loss
of
life
and
limb
and
at
the
command
of
headquarters
hath
been
punished
with
an
iron
hand
through
the
means
of
hangmen
and
their
satellites
openly
and
violently
yet
was
all
in
vain
for
the
gamesters
betook
themselves
to
secret
corners
and
behind
hedges
won
each
other
money
quarrelled
and
brake
each
others
necks
thereupon
so
that
to
prevent
such
murders
and
homicides
and
specially
because
many
would
game
away
their
arms
and
horse
yea
even
their
poor
rations
of
food
therefore
now
is
not
only
publicly
allowed
but
this
particular
place
is
appointed
therefore
that
the
mainguard
may
be
at
hand
to
prevent
any
harm
that
might
happen
yet
they
can
not
always
hinder
that
one
or
the
other
fall
not
dead
on
the
spot
and
inasmuch
as
this
gaming
is
the
tormenting
devil
own
device
and
bringeth
him
no
small
gain
therefore
hath
he
ordained
especial
that
prowl
around
in
the
world
and
have
naught
else
to
do
but
to
tempt
men
to
play
to
these
divers
wanton
companions
bind
themselves
by
certain
pacts
and
agreements
that
the
devil
may
suffer
them
to
win
yet
can
a
man
among
ten
thousand
gamesters
scarce
find
a
rich
one
nay
on
the
contrary
part
they
are
poor
and
needy
because
their
winnings
are
lightly
esteemed
and
therefore
either
gambled
away
again
or
wasted
in
vile
pleasures
hence
is
derived
that
true
yet
sad
saying
devil
never
leaveth
the
gamester
yet
leaveth
him
ever
poor
for
he
taketh
from
them
goods
courage
and
honour
and
then
quitteth
them
no
more
except
god
infinite
mercy
save
them
till
he
have
made
an
end
of
their
souls
yea
and
should
there
be
a
gamester
of
so
merry
a
heart
by
nature
and
so
sprightly
that
by
no
or
loss
he
can
be
brought
to
despair
to
recklessness
and
all
the
accursed
sins
that
spring
therefrom
then
doth
the
sly
and
cunning
fiend
suffer
him
to
win
mightily
that
in
the
end
he
may
by
waste
and
pride
and
gluttony
and
drunkenness
and
loose
life
bring
him
into
his
net
thereat
i
crossed
myself
and
blessed
myself
to
think
that
in
a
christian
army
such
things
should
be
allowed
which
the
devil
himself
invented
and
specially
because
visibly
and
palpably
such
damage
and
harm
for
this
world
and
the
next
followed
therefrom
yet
my
governor
said
all
that
he
had
told
me
was
as
yet
nought
for
he
who
would
undertake
to
describe
all
the
harm
that
came
from
gaming
would
begin
an
impossible
task
for
as
men
say
so
soon
as
the
hazard
is
thrown
is
now
in
the
devil
hands
so
should
i
fancy
that
with
every
die
as
it
rolled
from
the
player
hand
upon
cloak
or
table
there
ran
a
little
devil
to
guide
it
and
make
it
shew
as
many
points
as
his
master
interest
demanded
and
further
i
should
reflect
that
was
not
for
nought
that
the
devil
entered
into
the
game
so
heartily
but
doubtless
because
he
contrived
to
make
fine
gains
out
of
it
himself
and
with
that
note
thou
further
says
he
that
just
as
there
are
wont
to
stand
by
the
certain
chafferers
and
jews
which
buy
from
the
players
at
cheap
rate
what
they
have
won
as
rings
apparel
or
jewels
or
are
ready
to
change
such
for
money
for
them
to
game
away
so
also
there
be
devils
walking
to
and
fro
that
they
may
arouse
and
foster
thoughts
that
may
destroy
the
souls
in
the
gamesters
that
have
ceased
to
play
be
they
winners
or
losers
for
the
winners
the
devil
will
build
terrible
castles
in
the
air
but
into
them
that
have
lost
whose
spirit
is
already
quite
distraught
and
therefore
the
more
apt
to
receive
his
harmful
counsels
he
instilleth
doubtless
such
thoughts
and
designs
as
can
but
tend
to
their
eternal
ruin
yea
i
assure
thee
simplicissimus
i
am
of
the
mind
to
write
a
book
hereupon
so
soon
as
i
can
come
in
peace
to
my
own
again
and
in
that
i
will
describe
first
the
loss
of
precious
time
which
is
squandered
to
no
purpose
in
gaming
and
no
less
the
fearful
curses
with
which
men
blaspheme
god
over
their
then
will
i
likewise
recount
the
taunts
with
which
men
provoke
one
another
and
will
adduce
many
fearful
examples
and
stories
which
have
happened
in
during
and
after
play
and
there
will
i
not
forget
the
duels
and
homicides
that
have
happened
by
reason
of
gaming
yea
i
will
portray
in
their
true
colours
set
before
men
eyes
the
greed
the
rage
the
envy
the
jealousy
the
falsehood
the
deceit
the
covetousness
the
thievery
and
in
a
word
all
the
senseless
follies
both
of
dicers
and
of
that
they
who
read
this
book
but
once
may
conceive
such
a
horror
of
gaming
as
if
they
had
drunk
sows
milk
which
folk
are
wont
to
give
to
gamesters
without
their
knowledge
to
cure
their
madness
so
will
i
shew
to
all
christendom
that
the
dear
god
is
more
blasphemed
by
a
single
regiment
of
gamesters
than
by
a
whole
army
with
their
curses
and
this
project
i
praised
and
wished
him
the
opportunity
to
carry
it
out
is
somewhat
shorter
and
more
entertaining
than
the
last
now
my
governor
grew
more
and
more
kindly
disposed
to
me
and
i
to
him
yet
kept
we
our
friendship
very
secret
is
true
i
acted
still
as
a
fool
yet
i
played
no
bawdy
tricks
or
buffooneries
so
that
my
carriage
and
conduct
were
indeed
simple
enough
yet
rather
witty
than
witless
my
colonel
who
had
a
mighty
liking
for
the
chase
took
me
with
him
once
when
he
went
out
to
catch
partridges
with
the
which
invention
pleased
me
hugely
but
because
the
dog
we
had
was
so
hot
that
he
would
spring
for
the
birds
before
we
could
pull
the
strings
and
so
we
could
catch
but
little
therefore
i
counselled
the
colonel
to
couple
the
bitch
with
a
falcon
or
an
osprey
as
men
do
with
horses
and
asses
when
they
would
have
mules
that
the
young
puppies
might
have
wings
and
so
could
with
them
catch
the
birds
in
the
air
i
proposed
also
since
it
went
right
sleepily
with
the
conquest
of
magdeburg
which
we
then
besieged
to
make
ready
a
long
rope
as
thick
as
a
and
encompassing
the
whole
town
therewith
to
harness
thereto
all
the
men
and
all
the
cattle
in
the
two
camps
and
so
in
one
day
pull
the
whole
city
head
over
heels
of
such
foolish
quips
and
fantasies
i
devised
every
day
an
abundance
for
was
my
trade
and
none
ever
found
my
workshop
empty
and
for
this
my
master
secretary
which
was
an
evil
customer
and
a
hardened
rogue
gave
me
matter
enough
whereby
i
was
kept
on
the
road
which
fools
be
wont
to
walk
for
whatsoever
this
mocker
told
me
that
i
not
only
believed
myself
but
told
it
to
others
whenas
i
conversed
with
them
and
the
discourse
turned
on
that
subject
so
when
i
asked
him
once
what
our
regimental
chaplain
was
since
he
was
distinguished
from
other
folk
by
his
apparel
that
says
he
is
master
et
non
which
is
being
interpreted
into
german
a
fellow
that
gives
wives
to
others
and
takes
none
himself
he
is
the
bitter
enemy
of
thieves
because
they
say
not
what
they
do
but
he
doth
not
what
he
says
likewise
the
thieves
love
him
not
because
they
be
commonly
hanged
even
then
when
their
acquaintance
with
him
is
at
its
best
so
when
i
afterwards
addressed
the
good
priest
by
that
name
he
was
laughed
at
and
i
was
held
to
be
a
rogue
as
well
as
a
fool
and
at
his
request
well
basted
further
the
secretary
persuaded
me
they
had
pulled
down
and
set
on
fire
all
the
houses
behind
the
walls
of
prague
that
the
sparks
and
ashes
might
sow
all
over
the
world
the
seeds
of
evil
weeds
so
too
he
said
that
among
soldiers
no
brave
heroes
and
hearty
fighters
ever
went
to
heaven
but
only
simple
creatures
malingerers
and
the
like
that
were
content
with
their
pay
likewise
no
elegant
a
la
mode
cavaliers
and
sprightly
ladies
but
only
patient
jobs
henpecked
husbands
tedious
monks
melancholy
parsons
devout
women
and
all
manner
of
outcasts
which
in
this
world
are
good
neither
to
bake
nor
to
boil
and
young
children
he
told
me
too
a
lying
story
of
how
hosts
were
called
innkeepers
only
because
in
their
business
they
endeavoured
to
keep
in
with
both
god
and
the
devil
and
of
war
he
told
me
that
at
times
golden
bullets
were
used
and
the
more
precious
such
were
the
more
damage
they
did
yea
said
he
and
a
whole
army
with
artillery
ammunition
and
can
be
so
led
by
a
golden
chain
further
he
persuaded
me
that
of
women
more
than
half
wore
breeches
though
one
could
not
see
them
and
that
many
though
they
were
no
enchantresses
and
no
goddesses
as
was
diana
yet
could
conjure
bigger
horns
on
to
their
husbands
heads
than
ever
actaeon
wore
in
all
which
i
believed
him
so
great
a
fool
was
i
on
the
other
hand
my
governor
when
he
was
alone
with
me
entertained
me
with
far
different
discourse
moreover
he
brought
me
to
know
his
son
who
as
before
mentioned
was
a
in
the
saxon
army
and
was
a
man
of
far
different
quality
to
my
colonel
secretary
for
which
reason
my
colonel
not
only
liked
him
well
but
thought
to
get
him
from
his
captain
and
make
him
his
regimental
secretary
on
which
post
his
own
secretary
before
mentioned
had
set
his
mind
also
with
this
whose
name
like
his
father
was
ulrich
herzbruder
i
struck
up
such
a
friendship
that
we
swore
eternal
brotherhood
in
virtue
of
which
we
would
never
desert
each
other
in
weal
or
woe
in
joy
or
sorrow
and
because
this
was
without
his
father
knowledge
therefore
we
held
more
stoutly
and
stiffly
to
our
vow
by
this
was
it
made
our
chiefest
care
how
i
might
be
honourably
freed
from
my
coat
and
how
we
might
honestly
serve
one
another
all
which
however
the
old
herzbruder
whom
i
honoured
and
looked
to
as
my
father
approved
not
but
said
in
so
many
words
that
if
i
was
in
haste
to
change
my
estate
such
change
would
bring
me
grievous
imprisonment
and
great
danger
to
life
and
limb
and
because
he
foretold
for
himself
also
and
his
son
a
great
disgrace
close
at
hand
he
deemed
therefore
that
he
had
reason
to
act
more
prudently
and
warily
than
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
a
person
whose
great
approaching
danger
he
could
foresee
for
he
was
fearful
he
might
be
a
sharer
in
my
future
ill
luck
if
i
declared
myself
because
he
had
long
ago
found
out
my
secret
and
knew
me
inside
and
out
yet
he
never
revealed
my
true
condition
to
the
colonel
and
soon
after
i
perceived
yet
better
that
my
secretary
envied
my
new
brother
desperately
as
thinking
he
might
be
raised
over
his
head
to
the
post
of
regimental
secretary
for
i
saw
how
at
times
he
fretted
how
ill
will
preyed
upon
him
and
how
he
was
always
sighing
and
in
deep
thought
whenever
he
looked
upon
the
old
or
the
young
herzbruder
therefrom
i
judged
he
was
making
of
calculations
how
he
might
trip
and
throw
him
so
i
told
to
my
brother
both
from
my
faithful
love
to
him
and
also
as
my
certain
duty
what
i
suspected
that
he
might
a
little
be
on
his
guard
against
this
judas
but
he
did
but
take
it
with
a
shrug
as
being
more
than
enough
superior
to
the
secretary
both
with
sword
and
pen
and
besides
enjoying
the
great
favour
and
grace
a
rascally
trick
to
step
into
another
man
shoes
commonly
the
custom
in
war
to
make
provosts
of
old
tried
soldiers
and
so
it
came
about
that
we
had
in
our
regiment
such
a
one
and
to
boot
such
a
perfected
rogue
and
villain
that
it
might
well
be
said
of
him
he
had
seen
enough
and
more
than
enough
for
he
was
a
fully
qualified
sorcerer
necromancer
and
wizard
and
in
his
own
person
not
only
as
as
steel
but
could
make
others
also
yea
and
conjure
whole
squadrons
of
cavalry
into
the
field
his
countenance
was
exactly
like
what
our
painters
and
poets
would
have
saturn
to
be
save
that
he
had
neither
stilts
nor
scythe
and
though
the
poor
soldier
prisoners
that
came
into
his
merciless
hands
held
themselves
the
more
unlucky
because
of
this
his
character
and
his
presence
yet
were
there
folk
that
gladly
consorted
with
this
specially
oliver
our
secretary
and
the
more
his
envy
of
young
herzbruder
increased
who
was
ever
of
a
lively
humour
the
thicker
grew
the
intimacy
between
him
and
the
provost
whence
i
could
easily
calculate
that
the
conjunction
of
saturn
and
mercury
boded
no
good
to
the
honest
herzbruder
just
then
my
lady
was
rejoiced
at
the
coming
of
a
young
son
and
the
christening
feast
spread
in
wellnigh
princely
fashion
at
which
young
herzbruder
was
brought
to
wait
at
table
which
when
he
of
his
courtesy
willingly
did
he
gave
the
opportunity
to
oliver
to
bring
into
the
world
the
piece
of
roguery
of
which
he
had
long
been
in
labour
for
when
all
was
over
my
colonel
great
cup
was
missing
and
this
loss
he
made
the
more
ado
about
because
was
still
there
after
all
stranger
guests
had
departed
is
true
a
page
said
he
had
last
seen
it
in
oliver
hands
but
would
not
swear
it
upon
that
the
provost
was
fetched
to
give
his
counsel
in
the
matter
and
was
said
aside
to
him
that
if
he
by
his
arts
could
discover
the
thief
they
would
so
carry
the
matter
that
that
thief
should
be
known
to
none
save
the
colonel
for
officers
of
his
own
regiment
had
been
present
whom
even
if
one
of
them
had
forgotten
himself
in
such
a
matter
he
would
not
willingly
bring
to
shame
so
as
we
all
knew
ourselves
to
be
innocent
we
came
merrily
enough
into
the
colonel
great
tent
and
there
the
sorcerer
took
charge
of
the
matter
at
that
each
looked
on
his
neighbour
and
desired
to
know
how
end
and
whence
the
lost
cup
would
reappear
and
no
sooner
had
the
rogue
mumbled
some
words
than
there
sprang
out
of
each
breeches
sleeves
boots
and
pockets
and
all
other
openings
in
their
clothes
one
two
three
or
more
young
puppies
and
these
sniffed
round
and
round
in
the
tent
and
pretty
beasts
they
were
of
all
manner
of
colours
and
each
with
some
special
ornament
so
that
was
a
right
merry
sight
as
to
me
my
tight
croat
breeches
were
so
full
of
puppies
that
i
must
pull
them
off
and
because
my
shirt
had
long
before
rotted
away
in
the
forest
there
i
must
stand
naked
last
of
all
one
sprang
out
of
young
herzbruder
pocket
the
nimblest
of
all
and
had
on
golden
a
collar
this
one
swallowed
all
the
other
puppies
though
there
were
so
many
in
the
tent
that
one
could
not
put
his
foot
down
by
reason
of
them
and
when
it
had
destroyed
all
it
became
smaller
and
smaller
and
the
golden
collar
larger
till
at
last
it
turned
into
my
colonel
cup
thereupon
not
only
the
colonel
but
all
that
were
present
must
perforce
believe
that
none
other
but
young
herzbruder
could
have
stolen
the
cup
so
said
the
colonel
to
him
lookye
unthankful
guest
have
i
deserved
this
with
my
kindnesses
to
thee
this
theft
which
i
had
never
believed
of
thee
for
see
i
had
intended
to
make
thee
my
secretary
but
thou
hast
this
very
day
deserved
rather
that
i
should
have
thee
hanged
and
that
i
would
forthwith
have
done
had
i
not
had
a
care
of
thy
honourable
and
ancient
father
now
quick
said
he
out
of
my
camp
and
so
long
as
thou
livest
let
me
not
see
thee
more
so
poor
ulrich
would
defend
himself
yet
would
none
listen
to
him
for
his
offence
was
plain
and
when
he
departed
good
old
herzbruder
must
needs
fall
in
a
swoon
and
there
must
all
come
to
succour
him
and
the
colonel
himself
to
comfort
him
which
said
a
pious
father
was
not
to
answer
for
this
sinful
son
thus
by
the
help
of
the
devil
did
oliver
attain
to
that
whereto
he
had
long
hoped
to
come
but
could
not
in
any
honourable
fashion
do
so
how
ulrich
herzbruder
sold
himself
for
a
hundred
ducats
now
as
soon
as
young
herzbruder
captain
heard
this
story
he
took
from
him
his
office
and
made
a
pikeman
of
him
from
which
time
forward
he
was
so
despised
that
any
dog
might
bark
at
him
and
he
himself
wished
for
death
and
his
father
was
so
vexed
at
the
thing
that
he
fell
into
a
sore
sickness
and
looked
to
die
and
whereas
he
had
himself
prophesied
that
on
the
day
of
july
he
should
run
risk
of
life
and
limb
which
day
was
now
close
at
hand
therefore
he
begged
of
the
colonel
that
his
son
might
come
to
him
once
more
that
he
might
talk
with
him
of
inheritance
and
declare
his
last
will
at
this
meeting
i
was
not
shut
out
but
made
the
third
party
in
their
grief
then
i
saw
that
the
son
needed
no
defence
as
far
as
his
father
was
concerned
who
knew
his
ways
and
his
good
upbringing
and
therefore
was
assured
of
his
innocence
he
as
a
wise
understanding
and
man
judged
easily
from
the
circumstances
that
oliver
had
laid
this
trap
for
his
son
through
the
provost
but
what
could
he
do
against
a
sorcerer
from
whom
he
had
worse
to
expect
if
he
attempted
any
revenge
besides
he
looked
but
for
death
yet
could
not
die
content
because
he
must
leave
his
son
in
such
disgrace
in
which
plight
the
son
desired
not
to
live
but
rather
wished
he
might
die
before
his
father
and
truly
the
grief
of
these
two
was
so
piteous
to
behold
that
i
from
my
heart
must
weep
at
last
was
their
common
resolve
to
commit
their
cause
to
god
in
patience
and
the
son
was
to
devise
ways
and
means
to
be
quit
of
his
regiment
and
seek
his
fortune
elsewhere
but
when
they
examined
the
matter
they
had
no
money
with
which
he
might
buy
himself
out
of
the
service
and
while
they
considered
and
lamented
the
miserable
state
in
which
their
poverty
kept
them
fast
and
cut
off
all
hope
of
improving
of
their
present
condition
i
then
first
remembered
my
ducats
that
i
had
sewn
up
in
my
ass
ears
and
so
asked
how
much
money
they
wanted
in
their
need
so
young
herzbruder
answered
if
there
came
one
and
brought
us
a
hundred
thalers
i
could
trust
to
be
free
from
all
my
troubles
i
answered
him
brother
if
that
will
help
thee
have
a
good
heart
for
i
can
give
thee
a
hundred
ducats
alas
brother
says
he
what
is
this
thou
sayest
beest
thou
in
truth
a
fool
or
so
wanton
that
thou
makest
jests
upon
us
in
our
sore
affliction
nay
nay
said
i
i
will
provide
the
money
so
i
stripped
off
my
coat
and
took
one
of
the
asses
ears
from
my
arm
and
opened
it
and
bade
him
to
count
out
a
hundred
ducats
and
take
them
the
rest
i
kept
and
said
herewith
will
i
lend
thy
sick
father
if
he
need
it
thereupon
they
both
fell
on
my
neck
and
kissed
me
and
knew
not
for
very
joy
what
they
did
then
they
would
give
me
an
acknowledgment
and
therein
assure
me
i
should
be
the
old
herzbruder
together
with
his
son
or
that
if
god
should
help
them
to
their
own
again
they
would
return
me
the
same
with
interest
and
with
great
thanks
of
all
which
i
would
have
nothing
but
only
commended
myself
to
their
perpetual
friendship
after
that
young
herzbruder
would
have
sworn
to
be
revenged
on
oliver
or
to
die
but
his
father
forbade
it
and
prophesied
that
he
that
should
slay
oliver
would
meet
his
end
at
the
hands
of
me
simplicissimus
yet
said
he
i
am
well
assured
that
ye
two
will
never
slay
each
other
for
neither
of
you
shall
perish
in
fight
thereafter
he
pressed
upon
us
that
we
should
swear
on
oath
to
love
one
another
till
death
and
stand
by
each
other
in
all
straits
but
young
herzbruder
bought
his
freedom
for
thalers
for
which
his
captain
gave
him
an
honourable
discharge
and
betook
himself
with
the
rest
of
the
money
a
good
opportunity
offering
to
hamburg
and
there
equipped
himself
with
two
horses
and
enlisted
in
the
swedish
army
as
a
volunteer
trooper
commending
his
father
to
me
in
the
meanwhile
how
two
prophecies
were
fulfilled
at
once
now
none
of
my
colonel
people
shewed
himself
better
fitted
to
wait
on
old
herzbruder
in
his
sickness
than
i
and
inasmuch
as
the
sick
man
was
also
more
than
content
with
me
this
office
was
entrusted
to
me
by
the
colonel
wife
who
shewed
him
much
kindness
and
by
reason
of
good
nursing
and
being
relieved
in
respect
of
his
son
he
grew
better
from
day
to
day
so
that
before
july
the
he
was
almost
restored
to
full
health
yet
would
he
stay
in
bed
and
give
himself
out
to
be
sick
till
the
said
day
which
he
plainly
dreaded
should
be
past
meanwhile
all
manner
of
officers
from
both
armies
came
to
visit
him
to
know
their
future
fortune
bad
or
good
for
because
he
was
a
good
calculator
and
caster
of
horoscopes
and
besides
that
an
excellent
physiognomist
and
palmist
his
prophecies
seldom
failed
yea
he
named
the
very
day
on
which
the
battle
of
wittstock
afterwards
befel
since
many
came
to
him
to
whom
he
foretold
a
violent
death
on
that
day
my
colonel
wife
he
assured
she
would
end
her
in
the
camp
for
before
her
six
weeks
were
ended
magdeburg
would
not
be
surrendered
and
to
the
traitorous
oliver
who
was
ever
troublesome
with
his
visits
he
foretold
that
he
must
die
a
violent
death
and
that
i
should
avenge
that
death
happen
it
when
it
would
and
slay
his
murderer
for
which
cause
oliver
thereafter
held
me
in
high
esteem
but
to
me
myself
he
described
the
whole
course
of
my
life
to
come
as
particularly
as
if
it
were
already
ended
and
he
had
been
by
my
side
throughout
which
at
the
time
i
esteemed
but
lightly
yet
afterwards
remembered
many
things
which
he
had
beforetime
told
me
of
when
they
had
already
happened
or
had
turned
out
true
but
most
of
all
did
he
warn
me
to
beware
of
water
for
he
feared
i
might
find
my
destruction
therein
when
now
the
of
july
came
he
charged
me
and
also
the
orderly
whom
the
colonel
at
his
desire
had
appointed
him
for
that
day
most
straitly
we
should
suffer
no
one
to
enter
the
tent
there
he
lay
and
prayed
without
ceasing
but
as
was
near
to
afternoon
there
came
a
lieutenant
riding
from
the
cavalry
quarters
and
asking
for
the
colonel
master
of
the
horse
so
he
was
directed
to
us
and
forthwith
by
us
denied
entrance
yet
would
he
not
be
denied
but
begged
the
orderly
with
promises
intermixed
to
admit
him
to
see
the
master
of
the
horse
as
one
with
whom
he
must
that
very
evening
talk
when
that
availed
not
he
began
to
curse
to
talk
of
blood
and
thunder
and
to
say
he
had
many
times
ridden
over
to
see
the
old
man
and
had
never
found
him
now
that
he
had
found
him
at
home
should
he
not
have
the
honour
of
speaking
a
single
word
with
him
so
he
dismounted
and
nothing
could
prevent
him
from
unfastening
the
tent
himself
and
as
he
did
that
i
bit
his
hand
and
got
for
my
pains
a
hearty
buffet
so
as
soon
as
he
saw
mine
old
friend
i
ask
his
honour
pardon
says
he
for
the
freedom
i
have
taken
to
speak
a
word
with
him
tis
well
says
herzbruder
wherein
can
i
pleasure
his
honour
only
in
this
says
the
lieutenant
that
i
could
beg
of
his
honour
that
he
would
condescend
upon
the
casting
of
my
nativity
then
the
old
man
answered
i
hope
the
honourable
gentleman
will
forgive
me
that
i
can
not
by
reason
of
my
sickness
do
his
pleasure
herein
for
whereas
this
task
needs
much
reckoning
my
poor
head
can
not
accomplish
it
but
if
he
will
be
content
to
wait
till
i
hope
to
give
him
full
satisfaction
very
well
says
the
lieutenant
but
in
the
meantime
let
your
honour
tell
my
fortune
by
my
hand
sir
said
old
herzbruder
that
art
is
uncertain
and
deceiving
and
so
i
beg
your
worship
to
spare
me
in
that
matter
tomorrow
i
will
do
all
that
your
worship
asks
of
me
yet
the
lieutenant
could
not
be
so
put
off
but
he
goes
to
the
bed
holds
his
hand
before
the
old
man
eyes
and
says
he
good
sir
i
beg
but
for
a
couple
of
words
concerning
my
life
end
with
the
assurance
that
if
they
be
evil
i
will
accept
the
saying
as
a
warning
from
god
to
order
my
life
better
and
so
for
god
sake
i
beg
you
not
to
conceal
the
truth
then
the
honest
old
man
answered
him
in
a
word
and
says
he
is
well
then
let
the
gentleman
be
on
his
guard
lest
he
be
hanged
before
an
hour
be
past
what
thou
old
rogue
quoth
the
lieutenant
which
was
as
drunk
as
a
fly
durst
thou
hold
such
language
to
a
gentleman
and
drew
his
sword
and
stabbed
my
good
old
friend
to
death
as
he
lay
in
his
bed
the
orderly
and
i
cried
murder
so
that
all
ran
to
arms
but
the
lieutenant
was
so
speedy
in
his
departure
that
without
doubt
he
would
have
escaped
but
that
the
elector
of
saxony
with
his
staff
at
that
very
moment
rode
up
and
had
him
arrested
so
when
he
understood
the
business
he
turned
to
count
hatzfeld
our
general
and
all
he
said
was
this
be
bad
discipline
in
an
imperial
camp
that
even
a
sick
man
in
his
bed
were
not
safe
from
murderers
that
was
a
sharp
sentence
and
enough
to
cost
the
lieutenant
his
life
for
forthwith
our
general
caused
him
to
be
hanged
by
his
precious
neck
till
he
was
dead
how
simplicissimus
was
transformed
from
a
boy
into
a
girl
and
fell
into
divers
adventures
of
love
from
this
veracious
history
it
may
be
seen
that
all
prophecies
are
not
to
be
despised
as
some
foolish
folk
despise
them
that
will
believe
nothing
and
so
can
any
one
conclude
from
this
that
it
is
hard
for
any
man
to
avoid
his
predestined
end
whether
his
mishap
be
predicted
to
him
long
before
or
shortly
before
by
such
prophecies
as
i
have
spoken
of
and
to
the
question
whether
is
necessy
or
helpful
and
good
for
a
man
to
have
his
fortune
foretold
and
his
nativity
cast
i
answer
only
this
that
old
herzbruder
told
me
much
that
i
often
wished
and
still
wish
he
had
told
me
nothing
of
at
all
for
the
misfortunes
which
he
foretold
i
have
never
been
able
to
shun
and
those
that
still
await
me
do
turn
my
hair
grey
and
that
to
no
purpose
because
it
matters
not
whether
i
torment
myself
or
not
they
will
happen
to
me
as
did
the
rest
but
as
to
strokes
of
good
luck
that
are
prophesied
to
any
man
of
them
i
hold
that
they
be
ever
deceitful
or
at
least
be
not
so
fully
accomplished
as
the
unlucky
prophecies
for
how
did
it
help
me
that
old
herzbruder
swore
by
all
that
was
holy
i
was
born
and
bred
of
noble
parents
since
i
knew
of
none
but
my
dad
and
my
mammy
which
were
but
common
peasants
in
the
spessart
in
like
manner
how
did
it
help
wallenstein
the
duke
of
friedland
that
was
prophesied
to
him
he
should
once
be
crowned
king
with
stringed
music
thereto
doth
not
all
the
world
know
how
he
was
lulled
to
his
ruin
at
eger
others
may
worry
their
brains
over
such
questions
but
i
must
to
my
story
so
when
i
had
lost
my
two
herzbruders
in
the
manner
before
described
i
took
a
disgust
at
the
whole
camp
before
magdeburg
which
otherwise
i
had
been
wont
to
call
a
town
of
flax
and
straw
with
earthen
walls
for
now
i
was
as
tired
of
mine
office
of
a
fool
as
i
had
had
to
eat
it
up
with
iron
spoons
this
only
i
was
resolved
on
to
suffer
no
man
to
fool
me
more
but
to
be
rid
of
my
jester
garb
should
it
cost
me
life
and
limb
and
that
design
i
carried
out
but
scurvily
for
otherwise
i
had
no
opportunity
for
oliver
the
secretary
which
after
the
old
herzbruder
death
was
appointed
to
be
my
governor
often
gave
me
permission
to
ride
with
the
servants
so
as
we
came
once
on
a
time
to
a
great
village
wherein
was
plunder
very
fit
for
the
troopers
purpose
and
as
each
went
to
and
fro
into
the
houses
to
find
what
could
be
carried
off
i
stole
away
and
searched
to
find
some
old
peasant
clothing
for
which
i
could
exchange
my
fool
cap
yet
i
found
not
what
i
desired
but
must
be
content
with
a
woman
clothing
that
i
put
on
seeing
myself
alone
and
threw
mine
own
away
into
a
corner
imagining
now
nothing
else
but
that
i
was
delivered
from
all
mine
afflictions
in
this
dress
i
walked
across
the
street
where
were
certain
officers
wives
and
made
such
mincing
steps
as
perhaps
achilles
did
when
his
mother
brought
him
disguised
as
a
maiden
to
consort
with
lycomedes
his
daughter
yet
was
i
hardly
outside
the
house
when
some
foragers
caught
sight
of
me
and
taught
me
to
run
faster
for
when
they
cried
halt
halt
i
ran
the
quicker
and
before
they
could
overtake
me
i
came
to
the
said
ladies
and
falling
on
my
knees
before
them
besought
them
in
the
name
of
all
womanly
honour
and
virtue
they
should
protect
me
from
those
rascals
and
this
my
prayer
not
only
found
a
good
reception
but
i
was
hired
by
the
wife
of
a
captain
of
horse
whom
i
served
until
magdeburg
and
the
fort
at
werben
and
havelberg
and
perleberg
were
all
taken
by
our
people
the
captain
wife
was
no
baby
but
yet
young
and
came
so
to
dote
on
my
smooth
face
and
straight
limbs
that
at
length
after
long
trouble
and
vain
circumlocutions
she
gave
me
to
understand
in
all
too
plain
german
where
the
shoe
pinched
but
at
that
time
i
was
far
too
conscientious
and
pretended
i
understood
not
nor
would
i
show
any
outward
indication
by
which
any
man
might
judge
me
to
be
aught
but
a
virtuous
maiden
now
the
captain
and
his
servant
lay
sick
in
that
same
hospital
so
he
bade
his
wife
to
have
me
better
clothed
that
she
might
not
be
put
to
shame
by
my
miserable
peasant
kirtle
so
that
she
did
and
more
than
she
was
bidden
for
she
dressed
me
up
like
a
french
doll
and
that
did
but
fan
the
fire
wherewith
all
three
were
yea
and
it
waxed
so
that
master
and
man
begged
of
me
that
which
i
could
not
grant
to
them
and
that
which
i
refused
to
the
lady
though
with
all
manner
of
courtesy
at
last
the
captain
determined
to
take
an
opportunity
to
get
by
force
from
me
that
which
was
impossible
he
should
have
but
that
his
wife
marked
and
being
in
hopes
to
overcome
my
resistance
in
the
end
blocked
all
the
ways
and
laid
all
manner
of
obstacles
in
the
path
so
that
he
thought
he
must
in
the
end
go
mad
or
lunatick
once
on
a
time
when
my
master
and
mistress
were
asleep
the
servant
came
to
the
carriage
in
which
i
had
to
sleep
every
night
bemoaned
his
love
for
me
with
hot
tears
and
begged
most
solemnly
for
grace
and
mercy
but
i
shewed
myself
harder
than
any
stone
and
gave
him
to
understand
i
would
keep
my
chastity
till
i
was
married
then
he
offered
me
marriage
a
thousand
times
over
yet
all
he
could
get
from
me
was
an
assurance
was
impossible
for
me
to
marry
him
whereupon
he
became
desperate
or
pretended
it
and
drawing
his
sword
set
the
point
at
his
breast
and
the
hilt
against
the
carriage
and
acted
just
as
if
he
would
stab
himself
so
i
thought
the
devil
is
a
rogue
and
therefore
spoke
him
fair
and
comforted
him
saying
i
would
next
morning
give
him
a
certain
answer
with
that
he
was
content
and
went
to
bed
but
i
stayed
awake
the
longer
because
i
reflected
on
my
strange
condition
for
i
could
see
that
in
the
end
my
trick
must
be
discovered
for
the
captain
wife
became
more
and
more
importunate
with
her
enticements
the
captain
more
impudent
in
his
designs
and
the
servant
more
desperate
in
his
constant
love
and
out
of
such
a
labyrinth
i
could
see
no
escape
yet
if
the
lady
left
me
in
peace
the
captain
tormented
me
and
when
i
had
peace
from
both
of
them
at
night
then
the
servant
beset
me
so
that
my
women
clothes
were
worse
to
wear
than
my
fool
cap
then
indeed
but
far
too
late
i
thought
of
the
departed
herzbruder
prophecy
and
warning
and
could
imagine
nothing
else
but
that
i
was
already
fast
in
the
prison
he
spoke
of
and
in
danger
of
life
and
limb
for
the
woman
apparel
kept
me
imprisoned
since
i
could
not
get
out
of
it
and
the
captain
would
have
handled
me
roughly
if
he
had
once
found
out
who
i
was
and
had
caught
me
at
the
toilet
with
his
fair
wife
what
should
i
do
i
resolved
at
length
the
same
night
to
reveal
myself
to
the
servant
as
soon
as
was
day
for
i
thought
his
desires
will
then
cease
and
if
thou
art
free
with
thy
ducats
to
him
he
will
help
thee
to
man
clothes
again
and
so
out
of
all
thy
straits
which
was
all
well
devised
enough
if
luck
would
have
had
it
so
but
that
was
against
me
for
my
friend
hans
took
day
to
begin
just
after
midnight
and
came
to
get
his
yes
from
me
and
began
to
hammer
on
the
even
then
when
i
was
soundest
asleep
calling
out
a
little
too
loud
sabina
sabina
oh
my
beloved
rise
up
and
keep
your
promise
to
me
and
so
waked
the
captain
before
me
who
had
his
tent
close
by
the
carriage
and
now
he
saw
green
and
yellow
before
his
eyes
for
jealousy
had
already
got
a
hold
of
him
yet
he
came
not
out
to
disturb
us
but
only
got
up
to
see
how
the
thing
would
end
at
last
the
servant
woke
me
with
his
importunities
and
would
force
me
either
to
come
out
of
the
carriage
to
him
or
to
let
him
in
to
me
but
i
rebuked
him
and
asked
did
he
take
me
for
a
whore
my
promise
of
yesterday
was
on
condition
of
marriage
without
which
he
should
have
nought
to
do
with
me
he
answered
i
must
in
any
case
rise
for
it
began
to
grow
light
to
prepare
the
food
for
the
family
in
good
time
then
he
would
fetch
wood
and
water
and
light
the
fire
for
me
well
said
i
if
thou
wilt
do
that
i
can
sleep
the
longer
only
go
away
and
i
will
soon
follow
yet
as
the
fool
would
not
give
over
i
got
up
more
to
do
my
work
than
to
pleasure
him
for
methought
his
desperate
madness
of
yesterday
had
left
him
i
should
say
that
i
would
pass
pretty
well
for
a
in
the
field
for
with
the
croats
i
had
learned
how
to
boil
bake
and
wash
as
for
spinning
soldiers
wives
do
it
not
on
a
campaign
all
other
women
work
which
i
could
not
do
such
as
brushing
and
braiding
hair
my
mistress
gladly
forgave
me
for
she
knew
well
i
had
never
learned
it
but
as
i
came
out
of
the
coach
with
my
sleeves
turned
up
my
hans
was
so
inflamed
by
the
sight
of
my
white
arms
that
he
could
not
refrain
himself
but
must
kiss
me
and
i
not
greatly
resisting
that
the
captain
before
whose
eyes
this
took
place
could
bear
it
no
longer
but
sprang
with
drawn
sword
out
of
the
tent
to
give
my
poor
lover
a
thrust
but
he
ran
off
and
forgot
to
come
back
so
says
the
captain
to
me
thou
whore
in
grain
says
he
i
will
teach
thee
and
more
he
could
not
say
for
very
rage
but
struck
at
me
as
if
he
were
mad
but
i
beginning
to
cry
out
he
must
needs
stop
lest
he
should
alarm
the
camp
for
both
armies
saxon
and
imperialist
lay
close
together
expecting
the
approach
of
the
swedes
under
banér
how
he
was
imprisoned
for
a
traitor
and
enchanter
as
soon
as
it
was
day
my
master
handed
me
over
to
the
even
as
both
armies
were
striking
their
tents
these
were
a
pack
of
rascals
and
therefore
was
the
baiting
which
i
must
endure
the
greater
and
more
dreadful
for
they
hastened
with
me
to
a
thicket
the
better
to
satisfy
their
bestial
desires
as
is
the
custom
of
these
devils
children
when
a
woman
is
given
over
to
them
and
there
followed
them
many
fellows
looking
on
at
their
scurvy
tricks
and
among
them
my
hans
who
let
me
not
out
of
his
sight
and
when
he
saw
go
ill
with
me
would
rescue
me
by
force
even
should
it
cost
him
his
head
who
found
backers
enough
when
he
said
i
was
his
betrothed
wife
and
they
shewing
pity
for
him
and
me
were
ready
to
help
but
that
the
boys
who
thought
they
had
the
better
right
to
me
and
would
not
let
such
a
good
prize
go
would
not
have
and
went
about
to
repel
force
with
force
so
blows
beginning
to
be
dealt
on
both
sides
the
crowd
and
the
noise
became
greater
and
greater
till
it
seemed
almost
like
a
tournament
in
which
each
did
his
best
for
a
fair
lady
sake
all
this
terrible
hubbub
drew
the
to
the
spot
who
came
even
then
when
my
clothing
had
been
torn
from
my
body
and
was
plain
that
i
was
no
woman
his
coming
made
all
quiet
as
mice
for
he
was
feared
far
more
than
the
devil
himself
and
those
that
had
been
at
fisticuffs
scattered
but
he
briefly
inquired
of
the
matter
and
whereas
i
hoped
he
would
save
me
on
the
contrary
he
arrested
me
because
it
was
a
strange
and
suspicious
thing
for
a
man
to
be
found
in
an
army
in
women
clothes
accordingly
he
and
his
men
walked
off
with
me
to
the
regiments
which
were
all
afoot
and
ready
to
march
with
intent
to
deliver
me
to
the
or
but
when
we
were
about
to
pass
my
colonel
regiment
i
was
known
and
accosted
and
furnished
by
my
colonel
with
some
poor
clothes
and
so
given
in
custody
to
our
old
provost
who
put
me
in
irons
hand
and
foot
it
was
mighty
hard
work
for
me
so
to
march
in
fetters
and
the
old
curmudgeon
would
have
properly
plagued
me
had
not
the
secretary
oliver
paid
for
me
for
i
would
not
let
my
ducats
which
i
had
thus
far
kept
see
the
light
for
i
should
at
the
same
time
have
lost
them
and
also
have
fallen
into
greater
danger
the
said
oliver
informed
me
the
same
evening
why
i
was
kept
in
such
close
custody
and
the
regimental
sheriff
received
orders
at
once
to
examine
me
that
my
deposition
might
the
sooner
be
laid
before
the
for
they
counted
me
not
only
for
a
spy
but
also
for
one
that
could
use
witchcraft
for
shortly
after
i
left
my
colonel
certain
witches
were
burnt
who
confessed
before
their
death
that
they
had
seen
me
at
their
general
assembly
when
they
met
together
to
dry
up
the
elbe
that
magdeburg
might
be
taken
the
sooner
so
the
points
on
which
i
was
to
give
an
answer
were
these
whether
i
had
not
been
a
student
or
at
least
could
read
and
write
why
i
had
come
to
the
camp
at
magdeburg
disguised
as
a
fool
whereas
in
the
captain
service
i
had
been
as
sane
as
i
was
now
why
i
had
disguised
myself
in
women
apparel
whether
i
had
not
been
at
the
witches
dance
with
other
sorcerers
where
i
was
born
and
who
my
parents
were
where
i
had
sojourned
before
i
came
to
the
camp
before
magdeburg
and
where
and
to
what
end
i
had
learned
women
work
such
as
washing
baking
cooking
and
also
thereupon
i
would
have
told
my
whole
story
that
the
circumstances
of
my
strange
adventures
might
explain
all
but
the
judge
was
not
curious
only
weary
and
peevish
after
his
long
march
so
he
desired
only
a
round
answer
to
each
question
and
that
i
answered
in
the
following
words
out
of
which
no
one
could
yet
learn
aught
that
was
exact
or
precise
as
thus
i
had
not
been
a
student
but
could
read
and
write
german
i
had
been
forced
to
wear
a
fool
coat
because
i
had
no
other
because
i
was
weary
of
the
fool
coat
and
could
come
at
no
men
clothes
i
answered
yes
but
had
gone
against
my
will
and
knew
naught
of
witchcraft
i
was
born
in
the
spessart
and
my
parents
were
peasants
with
the
governor
of
hanau
and
with
a
colonel
of
croats
corpes
by
name
among
the
croats
i
had
been
forced
against
my
will
to
learn
cooking
and
the
like
but
at
hanau
because
i
had
a
liking
thereto
so
when
my
deposition
was
written
out
how
canst
thou
deny
says
he
and
say
thou
hast
not
studied
seeing
that
when
thou
didst
pass
for
a
fool
and
the
priest
in
the
mass
said
non
sum
dignus
thou
didst
answer
in
latin
that
he
need
not
say
that
for
all
knew
it
sir
said
i
others
taught
me
that
and
persuaded
me
was
a
prayer
that
one
must
use
at
mass
when
our
chaplain
was
saying
it
yes
yes
said
he
i
see
thou
art
the
very
kind
of
fellow
whose
tongue
must
be
loosed
by
the
torture
whereat
i
thought
god
help
thee
if
thy
tongue
follow
thy
foolish
head
early
next
morning
came
orders
from
the
to
our
provost
that
he
should
keep
me
well
in
charge
for
he
was
minded
as
soon
as
the
armies
halted
to
examine
me
himself
in
which
case
i
must
without
doubt
to
the
torture
had
not
god
ordered
it
otherwise
in
my
bonds
i
thought
ever
of
my
pastor
at
hanau
and
old
herzbruder
that
was
dead
how
both
had
foretold
how
it
would
fare
with
me
if
i
were
rid
of
my
fool
coat
again
how
the
provost
fared
in
the
battle
of
wittstock
the
same
evening
and
when
we
had
hardly
as
yet
pitched
our
tents
i
was
brought
to
the
who
had
before
him
my
deposition
and
also
writing
materials
and
he
began
to
examine
me
more
closely
but
i
on
the
other
part
told
my
story
even
as
it
had
happened
to
me
yet
was
not
believed
nor
could
the
judge
be
sure
whether
he
had
a
fool
or
a
knave
before
him
so
pat
did
question
and
answer
fall
and
so
strange
was
the
whole
history
he
bade
me
take
a
pen
and
write
to
see
what
i
could
do
and
moreover
to
see
if
my
handwriting
was
known
or
if
it
had
any
marks
in
it
that
a
man
could
recognise
i
took
pen
and
paper
as
handily
as
one
that
had
been
daily
used
to
employ
the
same
and
asked
what
i
should
write
the
who
was
perhaps
vexed
because
my
examination
had
prolonged
itself
far
into
the
night
answered
me
thus
what
says
he
write
down
mother
the
whore
those
words
i
did
write
down
and
when
they
were
read
out
they
did
but
make
my
case
worse
for
the
said
he
was
now
well
assured
that
i
was
a
rogue
then
he
asked
the
provost
had
they
searched
me
and
found
any
writings
upon
me
the
provost
answered
him
no
for
how
could
they
search
a
man
that
had
been
brought
to
them
naked
but
it
availed
nought
the
provost
must
search
me
in
the
presence
of
all
and
as
he
did
that
diligently
o
there
he
found
my
two
asses
ears
with
the
ducats
in
them
bound
round
my
arms
then
said
they
what
need
we
any
further
witness
this
traitor
hath
without
doubt
undertaken
some
great
plot
for
why
else
should
any
honest
man
disguise
himself
in
a
fool
raiment
or
a
man
conceal
himself
in
women
garments
and
how
could
any
suppose
that
a
man
would
carry
on
him
so
great
a
quantity
of
money
unless
it
were
that
he
intended
to
do
some
great
deed
therewith
for
said
they
did
he
not
himself
confess
he
had
learned
under
the
cunningest
soldier
in
the
world
the
commandant
of
hanau
gentlemen
says
they
what
think
you
he
did
not
learn
among
those
hessians
the
shortest
way
is
to
have
him
to
the
torture
and
then
to
the
stake
seeing
he
hath
in
any
case
been
in
the
company
of
sorcerers
and
therefore
deserveth
no
better
how
i
felt
at
that
time
any
man
can
judge
for
himself
for
i
knew
i
was
innocent
and
had
strong
trust
in
god
yet
i
could
see
my
danger
and
lamented
the
loss
of
my
fair
ducats
which
the
had
put
in
his
own
pocket
but
before
they
could
proceed
to
extremities
with
me
banér
folk
fell
upon
ours
at
the
first
the
two
armies
fought
for
the
best
position
and
then
secondly
for
the
heavy
artillery
which
our
people
lost
forthwith
our
provost
kept
pretty
far
behind
the
line
of
battle
with
his
helpers
and
his
prisoners
yet
were
we
so
close
to
our
brigade
that
we
could
tell
each
man
by
his
clothing
from
behind
and
when
a
swedish
squadron
attacked
ours
we
were
in
danger
of
our
lives
as
much
as
the
fighters
for
in
a
moment
the
air
was
so
full
of
singing
bullets
that
it
seemed
a
volley
had
been
fired
in
our
honour
at
that
the
timid
ducked
their
heads
as
they
would
have
crept
into
themselves
but
they
that
had
courage
and
had
been
present
at
such
sport
before
let
the
balls
pass
over
their
heads
quite
unconcerned
in
the
fighting
itself
every
man
sought
to
prevent
his
own
death
with
the
cutting
down
of
the
nearest
that
encountered
him
and
the
terrible
noise
of
the
guns
the
rattle
of
the
harness
the
crash
of
the
pikes
and
the
cries
both
of
the
wounded
and
the
attackers
made
up
together
with
the
trumpets
drums
and
fifes
a
horrible
music
there
could
one
see
nought
but
thick
smoke
and
dust
which
seemed
as
it
would
conceal
the
fearful
sight
of
the
wounded
and
dead
in
the
midst
of
it
could
be
heard
the
pitiful
outcries
of
the
dying
and
the
cheers
of
them
that
were
yet
full
of
spirit
the
very
horses
seemed
as
if
they
were
more
and
more
vigorous
to
defend
their
masters
so
furious
did
they
shew
themselves
in
the
performance
of
that
duty
which
they
were
compelled
to
do
some
of
them
one
could
see
falling
dead
under
their
masters
full
of
wounds
which
they
had
undeservedly
received
for
the
reward
of
their
faithful
services
others
for
the
same
cause
fell
upon
their
riders
and
thus
in
their
death
had
the
honour
of
being
borne
by
those
they
had
in
life
been
forced
to
bear
others
again
being
rid
of
the
valiant
burden
that
had
guided
them
fled
from
mankind
in
their
fury
and
madness
and
sought
again
their
first
freedom
in
the
open
field
the
earth
whose
custom
it
is
to
cover
the
dead
was
there
itself
covered
with
them
and
those
variously
distinguished
for
here
lay
heads
that
had
lost
their
natural
owners
and
there
bodies
that
lacked
their
heads
some
had
their
bowels
hanging
out
in
most
ghastly
and
pitiful
fashion
and
others
had
their
heads
cleft
and
their
brains
scattered
there
one
could
see
how
lifeless
bodies
were
deprived
of
their
blood
while
the
living
were
covered
with
the
blood
of
others
here
lay
arms
shot
off
on
which
the
fingers
still
moved
as
if
they
would
yet
be
fighting
and
elsewhere
rascals
were
in
full
flight
that
had
shed
no
drop
of
blood
there
lay
severed
legs
which
though
delivered
from
the
burden
of
the
body
yet
were
far
heavier
than
they
had
been
before
there
could
one
see
crippled
soldiers
begging
for
death
and
on
the
contrary
others
beseeching
quarter
and
the
sparing
of
their
lives
in
a
word
was
naught
but
a
miserable
and
pitiful
sight
the
swedish
conquerors
drove
our
people
from
their
position
which
they
had
defended
with
such
ill
luck
and
were
scattered
everywhere
in
pursuit
at
which
turn
of
things
my
provost
with
us
his
prisoners
also
took
to
flight
though
we
had
deserved
no
enmity
from
the
conquerors
by
reason
of
our
resistance
but
while
the
provost
was
threatening
of
us
with
death
and
so
compelling
us
to
go
with
him
young
herzbruder
galloped
up
with
five
other
horsemen
and
saluted
him
with
a
pistol
and
lookye
old
dog
says
he
is
it
the
time
now
to
breed
young
puppies
now
will
i
pay
thee
for
thy
pains
but
the
shot
harmed
the
provost
as
little
as
if
it
had
struck
an
anvil
so
beest
thou
of
that
kidney
said
herzbruder
yet
i
will
not
have
come
to
do
thee
a
courtesy
in
vain
die
thou
must
even
if
thy
soul
were
grown
into
thy
body
and
with
that
he
compelled
a
musqueteer
of
the
provost
own
guard
if
he
would
himself
have
quarter
to
cut
him
down
with
an
axe
and
so
that
provost
got
his
reward
but
i
being
known
by
herzbruder
he
bade
them
free
me
from
my
fetters
and
bonds
set
me
on
a
horse
and
charged
his
servant
to
bring
me
to
a
place
of
safety
of
a
great
battle
wherein
the
conqueror
is
captured
in
the
hour
of
triumph
but
even
then
while
my
rescuer
servant
conveyed
me
out
of
danger
his
own
master
was
by
reason
of
his
greed
of
honour
and
of
gain
carried
so
far
afield
that
he
in
his
turn
was
taken
prisoner
so
when
the
conquerors
were
dividing
of
the
spoil
and
burying
their
dead
and
herzbruder
was
his
captain
received
as
his
inheritance
me
with
his
servant
and
his
horses
whereby
i
must
submit
to
be
ranked
as
a
and
in
exchange
for
that
received
nought
save
only
these
promises
namely
that
if
i
carried
myself
well
and
could
grow
a
little
older
he
would
mount
me
that
is
make
a
trooper
of
me
and
with
that
i
must
be
content
but
presently
thereafter
my
captain
was
appointed
and
i
discharged
the
same
office
for
him
that
david
did
for
saul
for
when
we
were
in
quarters
i
played
the
lute
for
him
and
when
we
were
on
the
march
i
must
wear
his
cuirass
after
him
which
was
a
sore
burden
to
me
and
although
these
arms
were
devised
to
protect
their
wearers
against
the
buffets
of
the
enemy
i
found
it
the
contrary
for
mine
own
young
which
i
hatched
pursued
me
with
the
more
security
under
the
protection
of
those
same
arms
under
the
breastplate
they
had
their
free
quarters
pastime
and
playground
so
that
it
seemed
i
wore
the
harness
not
for
my
protection
but
for
theirs
for
i
could
not
reach
them
with
my
arms
and
could
do
no
harm
among
them
i
busied
myself
with
the
planning
of
all
manner
of
campaigns
against
them
to
destroy
this
invincible
armada
yet
had
i
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
drive
them
out
by
fire
as
is
done
in
ovens
nor
by
water
nor
by
poison
though
well
i
knew
what
quicksilver
would
do
much
less
had
i
the
opportunity
to
be
rid
of
them
by
a
change
of
raiment
or
a
clean
shirt
but
must
carry
them
with
me
and
give
them
my
body
and
blood
to
feed
upon
and
when
they
so
tormented
and
bit
me
under
the
harness
i
whipped
out
a
pistol
as
if
i
would
exchange
shots
with
them
yet
did
only
take
out
the
ramrod
and
therewith
drive
them
from
their
banquet
at
last
i
discovered
a
plan
to
wind
a
bit
of
fur
round
the
ramrod
and
so
make
a
pretty
for
them
and
when
i
could
be
at
them
under
the
harness
with
this
i
fished
them
out
in
dozens
from
their
dens
and
murdered
them
but
it
availed
me
little
now
it
happened
that
my
was
ordered
to
make
an
expedition
into
westphalia
with
a
strong
detachment
and
if
he
had
been
as
strong
in
cavalry
as
i
was
in
my
private
garrison
he
would
have
terrified
the
whole
world
but
as
was
not
so
he
must
needs
go
warily
and
for
that
reason
also
hide
in
the
gemmer
mark
a
wood
so
called
between
soest
and
ham
now
even
then
i
had
come
to
a
crisis
with
my
friends
for
they
tormented
me
so
with
their
excavations
that
i
feared
they
might
effect
a
lodgment
between
flesh
and
skin
let
no
man
wonder
that
the
brasilians
do
devour
their
lice
for
mere
rage
and
revenge
because
they
so
torment
them
at
last
i
could
bear
my
torment
no
longer
but
when
the
troopers
were
busy
some
feeding
some
sleeping
and
some
keeping
guard
i
crept
a
little
aside
under
a
tree
to
wage
war
with
mine
enemies
to
that
end
i
took
off
mine
armour
though
others
be
wont
to
put
it
on
when
they
fight
and
began
such
a
killing
and
murdering
that
my
two
swords
which
were
my
thumbnails
dripped
with
blood
and
hung
full
of
dead
bodies
or
rather
empty
skins
and
all
such
as
i
could
not
slay
i
banished
forthwith
and
suffered
them
to
take
their
walks
under
that
same
tree
now
whenever
this
encounter
comes
into
my
remembrance
forthwith
my
skin
doth
prick
me
everywhere
as
if
i
were
but
now
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
is
true
i
doubted
for
a
while
whether
i
should
so
revenge
myself
on
mine
own
blood
and
specially
against
such
true
servants
that
would
suffer
themselves
to
be
hanged
with
me
yea
and
broken
on
the
wheel
with
me
and
on
whom
by
reason
of
their
numbers
i
had
often
lain
softly
in
the
open
air
on
the
hardest
of
earth
but
i
went
on
so
furiously
in
my
tyrannical
ways
that
i
did
not
even
mark
how
the
imperialists
were
at
blows
with
my
till
at
last
they
came
to
me
terrified
my
poor
lice
and
took
me
myself
prisoner
nor
had
they
any
respect
for
my
manhood
by
the
power
of
which
i
had
just
before
slain
my
thousands
and
even
surpassed
the
fame
of
the
tailor
that
killed
seven
at
a
blow
i
fell
to
the
share
of
a
dragoon
and
the
best
booty
he
got
from
me
was
my
cuirass
and
that
he
sold
at
a
fair
price
to
the
commandant
at
soest
where
he
was
quartered
so
he
was
in
the
course
of
this
war
my
sixth
master
for
i
must
serve
him
as
his
how
a
notably
pious
soldier
fared
in
paradise
and
how
the
huntsman
filled
his
place
now
unless
our
hostess
had
been
content
to
have
herself
and
her
whole
house
possessed
by
my
army
was
certain
she
must
be
rid
of
them
and
that
she
did
short
and
sharp
for
she
put
my
rags
into
the
oven
and
burned
them
out
as
clean
as
an
old
so
that
i
lived
again
as
in
a
freed
from
my
vermin
yea
and
none
can
believe
how
good
it
was
for
me
to
be
free
from
that
torment
wherein
i
had
sat
for
months
as
in
an
ant
nest
but
in
recompense
for
that
i
had
a
new
plague
to
encounter
namely
that
my
new
master
was
one
of
those
strange
soldiers
that
do
think
to
get
to
heaven
he
was
contented
with
his
pay
and
never
harmed
a
child
his
whole
fortune
consisted
in
what
he
could
earn
by
standing
sentry
and
what
he
could
save
from
his
weekly
pay
and
that
poor
as
it
was
he
valued
above
all
the
pearls
of
the
orient
each
sixpence
he
got
he
sewed
into
his
breeches
and
that
he
might
have
more
of
such
sixpences
i
and
his
horse
must
starve
i
must
break
my
teeth
upon
dry
pumpernickel
and
nourish
myself
with
water
or
at
best
with
small
beer
and
that
was
a
poor
affair
for
me
inasmuch
as
my
throat
was
raw
from
the
dry
black
bread
and
my
whole
body
wasted
away
if
i
would
eat
i
must
needs
steal
and
even
that
with
such
secrecy
that
my
master
could
by
no
manner
of
means
be
brought
to
book
as
for
him
gallows
and
torture
headsmen
and
their
helpers
yea
and
surgeons
too
were
but
superfluous
sutlers
and
hawkers
too
must
soon
have
beat
a
retreat
from
him
for
his
thoughts
were
far
from
eating
and
drinking
gaming
and
quarrelling
but
when
he
was
ordered
out
for
a
convoy
or
an
expedition
of
any
sort
where
pay
was
there
he
would
loiter
and
dawdle
away
his
time
yea
i
believe
truly
if
this
good
old
dragoon
had
not
possessed
these
soldierly
virtues
of
loitering
he
would
never
have
got
me
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
followed
my
at
the
double
i
could
count
on
no
cast
clothes
from
him
for
he
himself
went
in
such
rags
as
did
beforetime
my
hermit
in
the
woods
his
whole
harness
and
saddle
were
scarce
worth
and
his
horse
so
staggering
for
hunger
that
neither
swede
nor
hessian
needed
to
fear
his
attack
all
these
fair
qualities
did
move
his
captain
to
send
him
to
paradise
which
was
a
monastery
so
called
on
not
indeed
as
if
he
were
of
much
avail
for
that
purpose
but
that
he
might
grow
fat
and
buy
himself
a
new
nag
and
most
of
all
because
the
nuns
had
asked
for
a
pious
and
conscientious
and
peaceable
fellow
for
their
guard
and
so
he
rode
thither
and
i
behind
him
for
he
had
but
one
horse
and
zounds
says
he
simbrecht
for
he
could
never
frame
to
pronounce
my
name
aright
when
we
come
to
paradise
we
will
take
our
fill
and
i
answered
him
yes
said
i
the
name
is
a
good
omen
god
grant
it
that
the
place
be
like
its
name
yes
yes
says
he
for
he
understood
me
not
if
we
can
get
two
ohms
of
the
good
westphalian
beer
every
day
we
shall
not
fare
look
to
thyself
for
i
will
now
have
a
fine
new
cloak
made
and
thou
canst
have
the
old
one
make
a
brave
new
coat
for
thee
well
might
he
call
it
the
old
one
for
i
believe
it
could
well
remember
the
battle
of
pavia
so
weatherbeaten
and
shabby
was
it
and
with
the
giving
of
it
he
did
me
but
little
kindness
paradise
we
found
as
we
would
have
it
and
still
better
in
place
of
angels
we
found
fair
maidens
who
so
entertained
us
with
food
and
drink
that
presently
i
came
again
to
my
former
fatness
the
strongest
beer
we
had
the
best
westphalian
hams
and
smoked
sausages
and
savoury
and
delicate
meat
boiled
in
salt
water
and
eaten
cold
there
too
i
learned
to
spread
black
bread
a
finger
thick
with
salt
butter
and
put
cheese
on
that
so
that
it
might
slip
down
better
and
when
i
could
have
a
knuckle
of
mutton
garnished
with
garlic
and
a
good
tankard
of
beer
beside
it
then
would
i
refresh
body
and
soul
and
forget
all
my
past
sufferings
in
a
word
this
paradise
pleased
me
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
the
true
paradise
no
other
care
had
i
except
that
i
knew
not
always
last
and
i
must
fare
forth
again
in
my
rags
but
even
as
misfortune
ever
came
to
me
in
abundance
when
it
once
began
to
pursue
me
so
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
good
fortune
would
run
it
hard
for
when
my
master
would
send
me
to
soest
to
fetch
his
baggage
thence
i
found
on
the
road
a
pack
and
in
the
same
some
ells
of
scarlet
cloth
cut
for
a
cloak
and
red
silk
also
for
the
lining
that
i
took
with
me
and
at
soest
i
exchanged
it
with
a
clothier
for
common
green
woollen
cloth
fit
for
a
coat
and
trappings
with
the
condition
he
should
make
such
a
coat
and
provide
me
also
with
a
new
hat
and
inasmuch
as
i
grievously
needed
also
a
new
pair
of
shoes
and
a
shirt
i
gave
the
huckster
the
silver
buttons
and
the
lace
that
belonged
to
the
cloak
for
which
he
procured
for
me
all
that
i
wanted
and
turned
me
out
so
i
returned
to
paradise
to
my
master
who
was
mightily
incensed
that
i
had
not
brought
my
findings
to
him
yea
he
talked
of
trouncings
and
for
a
trifle
an
he
had
not
been
shamed
and
had
the
coat
fitted
him
would
have
stript
it
off
me
for
to
wear
it
himself
but
to
my
thinking
i
had
done
a
good
piece
of
trading
but
now
must
the
miserly
fellow
be
ashamed
that
his
lad
went
better
clothed
than
he
therefore
he
rides
to
soest
borrows
money
from
his
captain
and
equips
himself
in
the
finest
style
with
the
promise
to
repay
all
out
of
his
weekly
and
that
he
carefully
did
he
had
indeed
himself
means
to
pay
that
and
more
also
but
was
too
sly
to
touch
his
stores
for
had
he
done
that
his
malingering
was
at
an
end
wherein
he
hoped
to
abide
softly
that
winter
through
and
some
other
naked
fellow
had
been
put
in
his
place
but
now
the
captain
must
perforce
leave
him
where
he
lay
or
he
would
not
recover
his
money
he
had
lent
thenceforward
we
lived
the
laziest
life
in
the
world
wherein
skittles
was
our
chief
exercise
when
i
had
groomed
my
dragoon
horse
fed
and
given
him
to
drink
then
i
played
the
gentleman
and
went
the
convent
was
safeguarded
also
by
our
opponents
the
hessians
with
a
musqueteer
from
lippstadt
the
same
was
by
trade
a
furrier
and
for
that
reason
not
only
a
but
also
a
fencer
and
lest
he
should
forget
his
art
he
daily
exercised
himself
with
me
in
all
weapons
in
which
i
became
so
expert
that
i
was
not
afraid
to
challenge
him
whenever
he
would
my
old
dragoon
in
place
of
fencing
with
him
would
play
at
skittles
and
that
for
no
other
wager
but
who
should
drink
most
beer
at
dinner
and
so
whoever
lost
the
convent
paid
this
convent
had
its
own
and
therefore
its
own
huntsman
and
inasmuch
as
i
also
was
clad
in
green
i
joined
myself
to
him
and
from
him
in
that
autumn
and
winter
i
learned
all
his
arts
and
especially
all
that
concerns
catching
of
small
game
for
that
cause
and
because
also
the
name
simplicissimus
was
somewhat
uncommon
and
for
the
common
folk
easily
forgotten
or
hard
to
pronounce
every
one
called
me
the
little
huntsman
and
meanwhile
i
learned
to
know
every
way
and
path
and
that
knowledge
i
made
good
use
of
thereafter
but
when
by
reason
of
ill
weather
i
could
not
take
my
walks
abroad
in
the
wood
then
i
read
all
manner
of
books
which
the
bailiff
of
the
convent
lent
me
and
so
soon
as
the
good
nuns
knew
that
besides
my
good
voice
i
could
also
play
a
little
on
the
lute
and
the
harpsichord
then
did
they
give
more
heed
to
me
and
because
there
was
added
to
these
qualities
a
prettily
proportioned
body
and
a
handsome
face
enough
therefore
they
deemed
all
my
manners
and
customs
my
doings
and
my
ways
to
be
the
ways
of
nobility
and
so
became
i
all
unexpectedly
a
gentleman
of
whom
one
could
but
wonder
that
he
should
serve
so
scurvy
a
dragoon
but
when
i
had
spent
the
winter
in
the
midst
of
such
pleasures
my
master
was
discharged
which
vexed
him
so
much
by
reason
of
the
good
living
he
was
to
lose
that
he
fell
sick
and
inasmuch
as
that
was
aggravated
by
a
violent
fever
and
likewise
the
old
wounds
that
he
had
got
in
the
wars
in
his
lifetime
helped
the
mischief
he
had
but
short
shrift
for
in
three
weeks
i
had
somewhat
to
bury
but
this
epitaph
i
wrote
for
him
old
miserly
lies
here
a
soldier
brave
and
good
who
all
his
lifetime
through
shed
a
drop
of
blood
by
right
and
custom
the
captain
could
take
and
inherit
the
man
horse
and
musquet
and
the
general
all
else
that
he
left
but
since
i
was
a
lively
lad
and
gave
hopes
that
in
time
i
should
not
fear
any
man
it
was
offered
me
to
take
all
if
only
i
would
take
the
place
of
my
dead
master
and
that
i
undertook
the
more
readily
because
i
knew
my
master
had
left
a
pretty
number
of
ducats
sewn
into
his
old
breeches
which
he
had
raked
together
in
his
lifetime
and
when
in
the
process
of
things
i
must
give
in
my
name
namely
simplicius
simplicissimus
and
the
which
was
named
cyriack
could
not
write
it
down
aright
says
he
there
is
no
devil
in
hell
with
such
a
name
thereon
i
asked
him
quickly
was
there
one
there
named
cyriack
and
clever
as
he
thought
himself
that
he
would
not
answer
and
that
pleased
my
captain
so
that
from
thenceforward
he
thought
well
of
me
how
the
huntsman
carried
himself
when
he
began
to
learn
the
trade
of
war
wherefrom
a
young
soldier
may
learn
somewhat
now
the
commandant
in
soest
needed
a
lad
in
his
stables
of
the
kind
that
i
seemed
to
him
to
be
and
for
that
reason
he
was
not
well
pleased
that
i
had
turned
soldier
but
would
try
to
have
me
yet
to
that
end
he
made
a
pretence
of
my
youth
and
that
i
could
not
yet
pass
for
a
man
and
having
set
this
forth
to
my
master
he
sends
to
me
and
says
he
harkye
little
huntsman
thou
shalt
be
my
servant
so
i
asked
what
would
my
duties
be
to
which
he
answered
i
should
help
to
tend
his
horses
no
sir
quoth
i
we
are
not
for
one
another
i
would
rather
have
a
master
in
whose
service
the
horses
should
tend
me
but
seeing
that
i
can
find
none
such
i
will
sooner
remain
a
soldier
thy
beard
says
he
is
yet
too
small
no
no
said
i
i
will
wager
i
can
encounter
any
man
of
eighty
years
a
beard
never
yet
killed
a
man
or
goats
would
be
in
high
esteem
oho
says
he
if
thy
courage
be
as
high
as
thy
wit
i
will
let
thee
pass
for
a
soldier
i
answered
that
can
be
tried
upon
the
next
occasion
and
therewithal
i
gave
him
to
understand
i
would
not
be
used
as
a
groom
so
he
left
me
as
i
was
and
said
the
proof
of
the
pudding
was
in
the
eating
so
now
i
betook
myself
to
my
old
dragoon
old
breeches
and
having
dissected
them
i
recovered
out
of
their
entrails
a
good
horse
and
the
best
musquet
i
could
find
and
all
must
for
me
be
as
bright
as
then
i
bought
a
new
suit
of
green
clothes
for
this
name
of
the
huntsman
suited
well
with
my
fancy
and
my
old
suit
i
gave
to
my
lad
for
was
too
small
for
me
and
so
could
i
ride
on
mine
own
account
like
a
young
nobleman
and
thought
no
small
beer
of
myself
yea
i
made
so
bold
as
to
deck
my
hat
with
a
great
plume
like
an
officer
and
with
that
i
raised
up
for
myself
enviers
and
mislikers
and
betwixt
them
and
me
were
presently
hot
words
and
at
last
even
buffets
yet
hardly
had
i
proved
to
one
or
two
that
same
science
which
i
had
learned
in
paradise
of
the
good
furrier
when
behold
not
only
would
all
leave
me
in
peace
but
would
have
my
friendship
moreover
besides
all
this
i
was
ever
ready
to
give
my
service
for
all
expeditions
on
foot
or
on
horseback
for
i
was
a
good
rider
and
quicker
on
foot
than
most
and
when
it
came
to
dealing
with
the
enemy
i
must
charge
forward
as
for
mere
pleasure
and
ever
be
in
the
front
rank
so
was
i
in
brief
time
known
both
among
friends
and
foes
and
so
famous
that
both
parties
thought
much
of
me
seeing
that
the
most
dangerous
attacks
were
entrusted
to
me
to
carry
out
and
to
that
end
whole
detachments
put
under
my
command
and
now
i
began
to
steal
like
any
bohemian
and
if
i
made
any
capture
of
value
i
would
give
my
officers
so
rich
a
share
thereof
that
was
allowed
me
to
play
my
tricks
on
forbidden
ground
for
whatever
i
did
i
was
supported
general
count
götz
had
left
remaining
in
westphalia
three
enemy
garrisons
to
wit
in
dorsten
in
lippstadt
and
in
coesfeld
and
all
these
three
i
mightily
plagued
for
i
was
before
their
gates
now
here
now
there
one
day
here
and
one
day
there
no
less
and
snapped
up
many
a
good
prize
and
because
i
ever
escaped
the
folk
came
to
believe
of
me
i
could
make
myself
invisible
and
was
as
proof
as
iron
or
steel
so
now
was
i
feared
like
the
plague
itself
so
that
thirty
men
of
the
enemy
would
not
be
shamed
to
flee
before
me
if
they
did
but
know
i
was
in
their
neighbourhood
with
fifteen
and
at
last
it
came
to
this
that
where
a
contribution
must
be
levied
from
a
place
i
was
the
man
for
that
and
my
plunder
from
that
became
as
great
as
my
fame
mine
officers
and
comrades
loved
their
little
huntsman
the
chief
partisans
of
the
opposite
side
were
terrified
and
by
fear
and
love
i
kept
the
countrymen
on
my
side
for
i
knew
how
to
punish
my
opposers
and
them
that
did
me
the
smallest
service
richly
to
repay
insomuch
that
i
spent
wellnigh
the
half
of
my
booty
in
paying
of
my
spies
and
for
that
reason
there
went
no
reconnaissance
no
convoy
no
expedition
out
from
the
adversary
whose
departure
was
not
made
known
to
me
whereupon
i
laid
my
plans
and
founded
my
projects
and
because
i
commonly
brought
the
same
to
good
effect
by
the
help
of
good
luck
all
were
astonished
and
that
chiefly
at
my
youthful
age
so
that
even
many
officers
and
good
soldiers
of
the
other
party
much
desired
to
see
me
to
this
must
be
added
that
i
ever
shewed
myself
courteous
to
my
prisoners
so
that
they
often
cost
me
more
than
my
booty
was
worth
and
whensoever
i
could
shew
a
courtesy
to
any
of
the
adversary
and
specially
to
any
officer
without
injury
to
my
duty
and
to
my
allegiance
to
my
master
i
neglected
it
not
and
by
such
behaviour
i
had
surely
been
presently
forwarded
to
the
rank
of
officer
had
not
my
youth
hindered
that
for
whosoever
at
the
age
wherein
i
then
was
would
be
an
ensign
must
be
of
noble
birth
besides
my
captain
could
not
promote
me
for
there
were
no
vacancies
in
his
own
company
and
he
would
not
let
me
go
to
another
for
so
would
he
have
lost
in
me
a
and
more
too
so
must
i
be
and
remain
a
corporal
yet
this
honour
which
i
had
gained
over
the
heads
of
old
soldiers
though
was
but
a
small
thing
yet
this
and
the
praise
which
daily
i
received
were
to
me
as
spurs
to
urge
me
on
to
better
things
and
day
and
night
i
dreamed
only
of
fresh
plans
to
make
myself
greater
nay
i
could
not
sleep
by
reason
of
such
foolish
phantasies
and
because
i
saw
that
i
wanted
an
opportunity
to
shew
the
courage
which
i
felt
in
me
it
vexed
me
that
i
could
not
every
day
have
the
chance
to
meet
the
adversary
in
arms
and
try
the
result
so
then
i
wished
the
trojan
war
back
again
or
such
a
siege
as
was
at
ostende
and
fool
as
i
was
i
never
thought
that
a
pitcher
goes
to
the
well
till
it
breaks
and
that
also
is
true
of
a
young
soldier
and
a
foolish
when
he
hath
but
money
and
luck
and
courage
thereupon
follow
haughtiness
and
pride
and
by
reason
of
that
pride
i
hired
in
place
of
one
footboy
two
whom
i
equipped
well
and
horsed
them
well
and
so
gained
the
envy
of
all
the
officers
how
the
devil
stole
the
parson
bacon
and
how
the
huntsman
caught
himself
now
must
i
tell
you
a
story
or
two
of
things
that
happened
to
me
before
i
left
the
dragoons
and
though
they
are
trifling
yet
are
they
amusing
to
be
heard
for
i
undertook
not
only
great
things
but
despised
not
also
small
affairs
if
only
i
could
be
assured
that
thereby
i
should
get
reputation
among
the
people
now
my
captain
was
ordered
with
fifty
odd
men
on
foot
to
schloss
recklinghausen
and
there
to
carry
out
a
certain
design
and
as
we
thought
that
before
the
plan
could
be
carried
out
we
had
best
hide
ourselves
a
day
or
two
in
the
woods
each
took
with
him
provision
for
a
week
but
inasmuch
as
the
rich
convoy
we
waited
for
came
not
at
the
appointed
time
our
food
gave
out
and
we
dared
not
to
steal
for
so
had
we
betrayed
ourselves
and
caused
our
plan
to
come
to
nothing
and
so
hunger
pressed
us
sore
moreover
i
had
in
that
quarter
no
good
friends
as
elsewhere
to
bring
me
and
my
men
food
in
secret
and
therefore
must
we
devise
other
means
to
line
our
bellies
if
we
would
not
go
home
empty
my
comrade
a
journeyman
latinist
who
had
but
lately
run
from
school
and
enlisted
sighed
in
vain
for
the
barley
soup
which
beforetime
his
parents
had
served
up
for
his
delight
and
which
he
had
despised
and
left
untasted
and
as
he
thought
on
those
meals
of
old
so
he
remembered
his
school
satchel
beside
which
he
had
eaten
them
ah
brother
says
he
to
me
not
a
shame
that
i
have
not
learned
arts
enough
to
fill
my
belly
now
brother
i
know
if
i
could
but
get
to
the
parson
in
that
village
provide
me
with
an
excellent
convivium
so
i
pondered
on
that
word
awhile
and
considered
our
condition
and
because
they
that
knew
the
country
might
not
leave
the
ambush
for
they
had
surely
been
recognised
while
those
that
were
unknown
to
the
people
knew
of
no
chance
to
steal
or
buy
in
secret
i
founded
my
plan
on
our
student
and
laid
the
thing
before
our
captain
and
though
was
dangerous
for
him
also
yet
was
his
trust
in
me
so
great
and
our
plight
so
evil
that
he
consented
so
i
changed
clothes
with
another
man
and
with
my
student
i
shogged
off
to
the
said
village
and
that
by
a
wide
circuit
though
it
lay
but
half
an
hour
from
us
and
coming
thither
we
forthwith
knew
the
house
next
the
church
to
be
the
priest
abode
for
was
built
and
abutted
on
the
wall
that
surrounded
the
whole
glebe
now
i
had
already
taught
my
comrade
what
he
should
say
for
he
had
yet
his
old
student
cloak
on
him
but
i
gave
myself
out
for
a
journeyman
painter
as
thinking
i
could
not
well
be
called
upon
to
exercise
that
art
in
the
village
for
farmers
do
not
often
have
their
houses
decorated
the
good
divine
was
civil
and
when
my
comrade
had
made
him
a
deep
latin
reverence
and
told
lies
in
great
abundance
to
him
as
how
the
soldiers
had
plundered
him
on
his
road
and
robbed
him
of
all
his
he
offered
him
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
and
a
draught
of
beer
but
i
made
as
though
i
belonged
not
to
him
and
said
i
would
eat
a
snack
in
the
inn
and
then
call
for
him
that
we
might
ere
the
day
was
spent
come
somewhat
further
on
our
way
together
and
to
the
inn
i
went
yet
more
to
espy
what
i
could
fetch
away
that
night
than
to
appease
mine
hunger
and
had
also
the
luck
on
the
way
to
find
a
peasant
plastering
up
of
his
oven
in
which
he
had
great
loaves
of
that
should
sit
there
and
bake
for
hours
with
the
innkeeper
i
did
little
business
for
now
i
knew
where
bread
was
to
be
had
yet
bought
a
few
loaves
of
white
bread
for
our
captain
and
when
i
came
to
the
parsonage
to
warn
my
comrade
to
go
he
had
already
had
his
fill
and
had
told
the
priest
i
was
a
painter
and
was
minded
to
journey
to
holland
there
to
perfect
my
art
so
the
good
man
bade
me
welcome
and
begged
me
to
go
into
the
church
with
him
for
he
would
shew
me
some
pieces
there
that
needed
repair
and
not
to
spoil
the
play
i
must
follow
so
he
took
me
through
the
kitchen
and
as
he
opened
the
lock
in
the
strong
oaken
door
that
led
to
the
churchyard
o
mirum
there
i
saw
that
the
black
heaven
above
was
dark
with
lutes
flutes
and
fiddles
meaning
the
hams
smoked
sausages
and
sides
of
bacon
that
hung
in
the
chimney
at
which
i
looked
with
content
for
it
seemed
as
if
they
smiled
at
me
and
i
wished
but
in
vain
to
have
them
for
my
comrades
in
the
wood
yet
they
were
so
obstinate
as
to
hang
where
they
were
then
pondered
i
upon
the
means
how
i
could
couple
them
with
the
said
oven
full
of
bread
yet
could
not
easily
devise
such
for
as
aforesaid
the
parson
yard
was
walled
round
and
all
windows
sufficiently
guarded
with
iron
bars
furthermore
there
lay
two
monstrous
great
dogs
in
the
courtyard
which
as
i
feared
would
of
a
surety
not
sleep
by
night
if
any
would
steal
that
whereon
was
the
reward
of
their
faithful
guardianship
to
feed
by
day
so
now
when
we
came
into
the
church
and
talked
of
the
pictures
and
the
priest
would
hire
me
to
mend
this
and
that
and
i
sought
for
excuses
and
pleaded
my
journey
says
the
sacristan
or
bellringer
fellow
says
he
i
take
thee
rather
for
a
runaway
soldier
than
a
painter
to
such
rough
talk
i
was
no
longer
used
yet
must
put
up
with
it
still
i
shook
my
head
a
little
and
answered
him
fellow
give
me
but
a
brush
and
colours
and
in
a
wink
i
will
have
thee
painted
for
the
fool
thou
art
whereat
the
priest
laughed
yet
said
to
us
both
was
not
fitting
to
wrangle
in
so
holy
a
place
with
that
i
perceived
he
believed
us
both
both
me
and
my
student
so
he
gave
us
yet
another
draught
and
let
us
go
but
my
heart
i
left
behind
among
the
smoked
sausages
before
nightfall
we
came
to
our
companions
where
i
took
my
clothes
and
arms
again
told
the
captain
my
story
and
chose
out
six
stout
fellows
to
bring
the
bread
home
at
midnight
we
came
to
the
village
and
took
the
bread
out
of
the
oven
for
we
had
a
man
among
us
that
could
charm
dogs
and
when
we
were
to
pass
by
the
parsonage
i
found
it
not
in
my
heart
to
go
further
without
bacon
in
a
word
i
stood
still
and
considered
deeply
whether
not
possible
to
come
into
the
kitchen
yet
could
find
no
other
way
but
the
chimney
which
for
this
turn
must
be
my
door
the
bread
and
our
arms
we
took
into
the
churchyard
and
into
the
and
fetched
a
ladder
and
rope
from
a
shed
close
by
now
i
could
go
up
and
down
chimneys
as
well
as
any
for
that
i
had
learned
in
my
youth
in
the
hollow
trees
so
on
to
the
roof
i
climbed
with
one
other
which
roof
was
covered
with
a
double
ceiling
and
a
hollow
between
and
therefore
convenient
for
my
purpose
so
i
twisted
my
long
hair
into
a
bunch
on
my
head
and
lowered
myself
down
with
an
end
of
the
rope
to
my
beloved
bacon
and
fastened
one
ham
after
another
and
one
flitch
after
another
to
the
rope
which
my
comrade
on
the
roof
most
regularly
hauled
up
and
gave
to
the
others
to
carry
to
the
bonehouse
but
alack
and
even
as
i
shut
my
shop
and
would
out
again
a
rafter
broke
under
me
and
poor
simplicissimus
tumbled
down
and
the
miserable
huntsman
found
himself
caught
as
in
a
is
true
my
comrades
on
the
roof
let
down
the
rope
to
draw
me
up
but
it
broke
before
they
could
lift
me
from
the
ground
and
now
huntsman
thought
i
thou
must
abide
a
hunt
in
which
thy
hide
will
be
as
torn
as
was
actaeon
for
the
priest
was
awakened
by
my
fall
and
bade
his
cook
forthwith
to
kindle
a
light
who
came
in
her
nightdress
into
the
kitchen
with
her
gown
hanging
on
her
shoulders
and
stood
so
near
me
that
she
almost
touched
me
then
she
took
up
an
ember
held
the
light
to
it
and
began
to
blow
yet
i
blew
harder
which
so
affrighted
the
good
creature
that
she
let
both
fire
and
candle
fall
and
ran
to
her
master
so
i
gained
time
to
consider
by
what
means
i
could
help
myself
out
yet
found
i
none
now
my
comrades
gave
me
to
understand
through
the
chimney
they
would
break
the
house
open
and
have
me
forth
that
would
i
not
have
but
bade
them
to
look
to
their
arms
and
leave
only
my
especial
comrade
on
the
roof
and
wait
to
see
if
i
could
not
get
away
without
noise
and
disturbance
lest
our
ambush
should
be
frustrated
but
if
it
could
not
be
so
then
might
they
do
their
best
meanwhile
the
good
priest
himself
struck
a
light
while
his
cook
told
him
a
fearful
spectre
was
in
the
kitchen
who
had
two
heads
for
she
had
seen
my
hair
in
a
bunch
on
my
head
and
had
mistook
it
for
a
second
head
all
this
i
heard
and
accordingly
smeared
my
face
and
arms
with
my
hands
which
were
full
of
ashes
soot
and
cinders
so
vilely
that
without
question
i
no
longer
could
be
likened
to
an
angel
as
those
holy
maidens
in
paradise
had
likened
me
and
that
same
sacristan
had
he
but
seen
me
would
have
granted
me
this
that
i
was
a
quick
painter
and
now
i
began
to
rattle
round
in
the
kitchen
in
fearful
wise
and
to
throw
the
pots
and
pans
about
and
the
coming
to
my
hand
i
hung
it
round
my
neck
and
the
i
kept
in
my
hand
to
defend
myself
in
case
of
need
all
which
dismayed
not
that
good
priest
for
he
came
in
procession
with
his
cook
who
bore
two
in
her
hands
and
a
stoup
on
her
arm
he
himself
being
vested
in
his
surplice
and
stole
with
the
sprinkler
in
one
hand
and
a
book
in
the
other
out
of
which
he
began
to
exorcise
me
and
to
ask
who
i
was
and
what
i
did
there
so
as
he
took
me
to
be
the
devil
i
thought
was
but
fair
i
should
play
the
part
as
the
father
of
lies
and
so
answered
i
am
the
devil
and
will
wring
thy
neck
and
thy
cook
too
yet
he
went
on
with
his
conjuring
and
bade
me
take
note
i
had
no
concern
with
him
nor
his
cook
yea
and
commanded
me
under
the
most
solemn
adjuration
that
i
should
depart
to
the
place
whence
i
had
come
to
which
i
answered
with
a
horrible
voice
that
was
impossible
even
if
i
would
meanwhile
my
comrade
on
the
roof
which
was
an
and
knew
his
latin
well
had
his
part
to
play
for
when
he
heard
what
time
of
day
was
in
the
kitchen
he
hooted
like
an
owl
he
barked
like
a
dog
he
neighed
like
a
horse
he
bleated
like
a
goat
he
brayed
like
an
ass
and
made
himself
heard
down
the
chimney
like
a
whole
crew
of
cats
bucking
in
february
and
then
again
like
a
clucking
hen
for
the
fellow
could
imitate
any
beasts
cry
and
when
he
would
could
howl
as
naturally
as
if
a
whole
pack
of
wolves
were
there
and
this
terrified
the
priest
and
his
cook
more
than
anything
yet
was
my
conscience
sore
to
suffer
myself
to
be
abjured
as
the
devil
for
he
truly
took
me
for
such
as
having
read
or
heard
that
the
devil
loved
to
appear
clad
in
green
now
in
the
midst
of
these
doubts
which
troubled
both
parties
alike
i
was
aware
by
good
luck
that
the
key
in
the
lock
of
the
door
that
led
to
the
churchyard
was
not
turned
but
only
the
bolt
shot
so
i
speedily
drew
it
back
and
whipped
out
of
the
door
into
the
churchyard
where
i
found
my
comrades
standing
with
their
musquets
cocked
and
left
the
parson
to
conjure
devils
as
long
as
he
would
so
when
my
comrade
had
brought
my
hat
down
from
the
roof
and
we
had
packed
up
our
provands
we
went
off
to
our
fellows
having
no
further
business
in
the
village
save
that
we
should
have
returned
the
borrowed
ladder
and
rope
to
their
owners
with
our
stolen
food
the
whole
party
refreshed
themselves
and
all
had
cause
enough
to
laugh
over
my
adventure
only
the
student
could
not
stomach
it
that
i
should
rob
the
priest
that
had
so
nobly
filled
his
belly
yea
he
swore
loud
and
long
he
would
fain
pay
him
for
his
bacon
had
he
but
the
means
at
hand
and
yet
ate
of
it
as
heartily
as
if
he
were
hired
for
the
business
so
we
lay
in
our
ambush
two
days
longer
and
waited
for
the
convoy
we
had
so
long
looked
for
where
we
lost
no
single
man
in
the
attack
yet
captured
over
thirty
prisoners
and
as
splendid
booty
as
ever
i
did
help
to
divide
and
i
had
a
double
share
because
i
had
done
best
and
that
was
three
fine
friesland
stallions
laden
with
as
much
merchandise
as
we
could
carry
off
in
our
haste
and
had
we
had
time
to
examine
the
booty
and
to
bring
it
to
a
place
of
safety
each
for
his
own
part
would
have
been
rich
enough
but
we
had
to
leave
more
on
the
spot
than
we
bore
off
for
we
must
hurry
away
with
all
speed
taking
what
we
could
carry
and
for
greater
safety
we
betook
ourselves
to
rehnen
and
there
we
baited
and
shared
the
booty
for
there
lay
our
main
body
and
there
i
thought
again
on
the
priest
whose
bacon
i
had
stolen
and
now
may
the
reader
think
what
a
misguided
wanton
and
overweening
spirit
was
mine
when
it
was
not
enough
for
me
to
have
robbed
and
terrified
that
pious
man
but
i
must
claim
honour
for
it
to
that
end
i
took
a
sapphire
set
in
a
gold
ring
which
i
had
picked
up
on
that
same
plundering
expedition
and
sent
it
from
rehnen
to
my
priest
by
a
sure
hand
with
this
letter
reverend
sir
had
i
but
in
these
last
days
had
aught
in
the
wood
to
eat
and
so
to
live
i
had
had
no
cause
to
steal
your
reverence
bacon
in
which
matter
is
likely
you
were
terrified
i
swear
by
all
that
is
holy
that
such
affright
was
against
my
will
and
so
the
more
do
i
hope
for
forgiveness
as
concerning
the
bacon
itself
but
just
it
should
be
paid
for
and
therefore
in
place
of
money
i
send
this
present
ring
given
by
those
for
whose
behoof
your
goods
must
needs
be
taken
and
beg
your
reverence
will
be
pleased
to
accept
the
same
and
add
thereto
that
he
will
always
find
on
all
occasions
an
obedient
and
faithful
servant
in
him
whom
his
sacristan
took
to
be
no
painter
and
who
is
otherwise
known
as
huntsman
but
to
the
peasant
whose
oven
they
had
emptied
the
party
sent
out
of
the
general
booty
sixteen
for
i
had
taught
them
that
in
such
wise
they
must
bring
the
on
their
side
seeing
that
such
could
often
help
a
party
out
of
great
difficulties
or
betray
such
another
party
and
bring
all
to
the
gallows
from
rehnen
we
marched
to
münster
and
thence
to
ham
and
so
home
to
soest
to
our
headquarters
where
i
after
some
days
received
an
answer
from
his
reverence
as
follows
noble
huntsman
if
he
from
whom
you
stole
the
bacon
had
known
that
you
would
appear
to
him
in
devilish
guise
he
had
not
so
often
wished
to
behold
the
notorious
huntsman
but
even
as
the
borrowed
meat
and
bread
have
been
far
too
dearly
paid
for
so
also
is
the
fright
inflicted
the
easier
to
forgive
especially
because
was
caused
against
his
will
by
so
famous
a
person
who
is
hereby
forgiven
with
the
request
that
he
will
once
more
visit
without
fear
him
who
fears
not
to
conjure
the
vale
and
so
did
i
everywhere
and
gained
much
fame
yea
and
the
more
i
gave
away
and
spent
the
more
the
booty
flowed
in
and
i
conceived
that
i
had
laid
out
that
ring
well
though
was
worth
some
hundred
and
so
ends
this
second
book
book
iii
how
the
huntsman
went
too
far
to
the
left
hand
the
gentle
reader
will
have
understood
by
the
foregoing
book
how
ambitious
i
had
become
in
soest
and
that
i
had
sought
and
found
honour
fame
and
favour
in
deeds
which
in
others
had
deserved
punishment
and
now
will
i
tell
how
through
my
folly
i
let
myself
be
further
led
astray
and
so
lived
in
constant
danger
of
life
and
limb
for
i
was
so
busied
to
gain
honour
and
fame
that
i
could
not
sleep
by
reason
of
it
and
being
full
of
such
fancies
and
lying
awake
many
a
night
to
devise
new
plots
and
plans
i
had
many
wondrous
conceits
in
this
wise
i
contrived
a
kind
of
shoes
that
a
man
could
put
on
hind
part
before
so
that
the
heel
came
under
his
toes
and
of
these
at
mine
own
cost
i
caused
thirty
different
pairs
to
be
made
and
when
i
had
given
these
out
to
my
fellows
and
with
them
went
on
a
foray
was
clean
impossible
to
follow
our
tracks
for
now
would
we
wear
these
and
now
again
our
right
shoes
on
our
feet
and
the
others
in
our
knapsacks
so
that
if
a
man
came
to
a
place
where
i
had
bidden
them
change
shoes
for
all
the
world
by
the
tracks
as
if
two
parties
had
met
together
there
and
together
had
vanished
away
but
if
i
kept
these
new
invented
shoes
on
throughout
it
seemed
as
i
had
gone
thither
whence
in
truth
i
had
come
or
had
come
from
the
place
to
which
i
now
went
and
besides
this
my
tracks
were
at
all
times
confused
as
in
a
maze
so
that
they
who
should
pursue
or
seek
news
of
me
from
the
footprints
could
never
come
at
me
often
i
was
close
by
a
party
of
the
enemy
who
were
minded
to
seek
me
far
away
and
still
more
often
miles
away
from
some
thicket
which
they
had
surrounded
and
were
searching
in
hopes
to
find
me
and
as
i
managed
with
my
parties
on
foot
so
did
i
also
when
we
were
on
horseback
for
to
me
was
simple
enough
to
dismount
at
and
forked
ways
and
there
have
the
horses
shoes
set
on
hind
part
before
but
the
common
tricks
that
soldiers
use
being
weak
in
numbers
to
appear
from
the
tracks
to
be
strong
or
being
strong
to
appear
weak
these
were
for
me
so
common
and
i
held
them
so
cheap
that
i
care
not
to
tell
of
them
moreover
i
devised
an
instrument
wherewith
if
was
calm
weather
i
could
by
night
hear
a
trumpet
blow
three
hours
march
away
could
hear
a
horse
neigh
or
a
dog
bark
at
two
hours
distance
and
hear
men
talk
at
three
miles
which
art
i
kept
secret
and
gained
thereby
great
respect
for
it
seemed
to
all
incredible
yet
by
day
was
this
instrument
which
i
commonly
kept
with
a
in
my
breeches
pouch
not
so
useful
even
though
in
a
quiet
and
lonely
place
for
with
it
one
could
not
choose
but
hear
every
sound
made
by
horses
and
cattle
yea
the
smallest
bird
in
the
air
and
the
frog
in
the
water
in
all
the
country
round
and
all
this
could
be
as
plainly
heard
as
if
one
were
in
the
midst
of
a
market
among
men
and
beasts
where
all
do
make
such
noise
that
for
the
crying
of
one
a
man
can
not
understand
another
is
true
i
know
well
there
are
folk
who
to
this
day
will
not
believe
this
but
believe
it
or
not
is
but
the
truth
with
this
instrument
i
can
by
night
know
any
man
that
talks
but
so
loud
as
his
custom
is
by
his
voice
though
he
be
as
far
from
me
as
where
with
a
good
one
could
by
day
know
him
by
his
clothes
yet
can
i
blame
no
one
if
he
believe
not
what
i
here
write
for
none
of
those
would
believe
me
which
saw
with
their
own
eyes
how
i
used
the
said
instrument
and
would
say
to
them
i
hear
cavalry
for
the
horses
are
shod
or
i
hear
peasants
coming
for
the
horses
are
unshod
or
i
hear
waggoners
but
is
only
peasants
for
i
know
them
by
their
talk
here
come
musqueteers
and
so
many
for
i
hear
the
rattling
of
their
bandoliers
there
is
a
village
near
by
for
i
hear
the
cocks
crow
and
the
dogs
bark
there
goes
a
herd
of
cattle
for
i
hear
sheep
bleat
and
cows
low
and
pigs
grunt
and
so
forth
mine
own
comrades
at
first
would
hold
this
but
for
vain
boasting
and
when
they
found
that
all
i
said
proved
true
in
fact
then
all
must
be
witchcraft
and
what
i
said
must
have
been
told
to
me
by
the
devil
and
his
dam
and
so
i
believe
will
the
gentle
reader
also
think
nevertheless
by
such
means
did
i
often
escape
the
adversary
when
he
had
news
of
me
and
came
to
capture
me
and
i
deem
that
if
i
had
published
this
discovery
since
have
become
common
for
it
would
be
of
great
service
in
war
and
notably
in
sieges
but
i
return
to
my
history
if
i
was
not
needed
for
a
foray
i
would
go
and
then
were
neither
horses
cows
pigs
nor
sheep
safe
from
me
that
i
could
find
for
miles
round
for
i
had
a
contrivance
to
put
boots
or
shoes
on
the
horses
and
cattle
till
i
came
to
a
frequented
road
where
none
could
trace
them
and
then
i
would
shoe
the
horses
hind
part
before
or
if
cows
and
oxen
i
put
shoes
on
them
which
to
that
end
i
had
caused
to
be
made
and
so
brought
them
to
a
safe
place
and
the
big
fat
which
by
reason
of
laziness
care
not
to
travel
by
night
these
i
devised
a
masterly
trick
to
bring
away
however
much
they
might
grunt
and
refuse
for
i
made
a
savoury
brew
with
meal
and
water
and
soaked
a
sponge
in
it
this
i
fastened
to
a
strong
cord
and
let
them
for
whom
i
angled
swallow
that
sponge
full
of
the
broth
but
kept
the
cord
in
my
hand
whereupon
without
further
parley
they
went
contentedly
with
me
and
paid
their
score
with
hams
and
sausages
and
all
i
brought
home
i
faithfully
shared
both
with
the
officers
and
my
comrades
and
so
i
got
leave
to
fare
forth
again
and
when
my
thefts
were
spied
upon
and
betrayed
they
helped
me
finely
through
for
the
rest
i
deemed
myself
far
too
good
to
steal
from
poor
men
or
rob
and
filch
such
small
deer
and
with
all
this
i
began
by
little
and
little
to
lead
an
epicurish
life
in
regard
of
eating
and
drinking
for
now
i
had
forgot
my
hermit
teaching
and
had
none
to
guide
my
youth
or
to
whom
i
might
look
up
for
my
officers
shared
with
me
and
caroused
with
me
and
they
that
should
have
warned
and
chastised
me
rather
enticed
me
to
all
vices
by
this
means
i
became
so
godless
and
wicked
that
no
villainy
was
too
great
for
me
to
compass
but
at
last
i
was
secretly
envied
specially
by
my
comrades
as
having
a
luckier
hand
at
thieving
than
any
other
and
also
by
my
officers
because
i
cut
such
a
figure
was
lucky
in
forays
and
made
for
myself
a
greater
name
and
reputation
than
they
themselves
had
in
a
word
i
am
well
assured
one
party
or
the
other
would
have
sacrificed
me
had
i
not
spent
so
much
how
the
huntsman
of
soest
did
rid
himself
of
the
huntsman
of
wesel
now
as
i
was
living
in
this
fashion
and
busied
with
this
namely
to
have
me
certain
made
and
grisly
raiment
thereto
appertaining
with
cloven
hoofs
by
which
means
to
terrify
our
foes
and
specially
to
take
their
goods
from
our
friends
unbeknown
for
which
the
affair
of
the
gave
me
the
first
hint
i
had
news
that
a
fellow
was
at
wesel
which
was
a
renowned
partisan
went
clad
in
green
and
under
my
name
practised
divers
rapes
and
robberies
here
and
there
in
the
land
but
chiefly
among
our
supporters
so
that
plaints
against
me
were
raised
and
i
must
have
paid
for
it
smartly
had
i
not
clearly
shewn
that
at
the
very
time
he
played
these
and
other
like
tricks
in
my
name
i
was
elsewhere
now
this
i
would
not
pardon
him
much
less
suffer
him
longer
to
use
my
name
to
plunder
in
my
shape
and
so
bring
me
to
shame
so
with
the
knowledge
of
the
commandant
at
soest
i
sent
him
an
invitation
to
the
open
field
with
swords
or
pistols
but
as
he
had
no
heart
to
appear
i
let
it
be
known
i
would
be
revenged
on
him
even
though
it
were
in
the
very
quarters
of
the
commandant
at
wesel
who
had
failed
to
punish
him
yea
i
said
openly
if
i
found
him
on
a
foray
i
would
treat
him
as
an
enemy
and
that
determined
me
to
let
my
masks
alone
with
which
i
had
planned
to
do
great
things
to
cut
my
green
livery
in
pieces
and
to
burn
it
publicly
in
soest
in
front
of
my
quarters
to
say
nothing
of
all
my
clothing
and
horse
harness
which
were
worth
well
over
a
hundred
ducats
yea
and
in
my
wrath
i
swore
that
the
next
that
should
call
me
huntsman
must
either
kill
me
or
die
by
my
hand
should
it
cost
me
my
life
nor
would
i
ever
again
lead
a
party
for
i
was
not
bound
to
do
so
being
no
officer
till
i
had
avenged
myself
on
my
counterfeit
at
wesel
so
i
kept
myself
to
myself
and
did
no
more
any
exploits
save
that
i
did
my
duty
as
sentry
wheresoever
i
might
be
ordered
to
go
and
that
i
performed
as
any
malingerer
might
and
as
sleepily
as
might
well
be
and
this
thing
became
known
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
of
the
enemy
became
so
bold
and
assured
at
this
that
they
every
day
would
bivouac
close
to
our
pickets
and
that
at
last
i
could
endure
no
longer
yet
what
plagued
me
most
of
all
was
this
that
this
huntsman
of
wesel
went
ever
on
his
old
way
giving
himself
out
for
me
and
under
that
name
getting
plunder
enough
and
to
spare
meanwhile
while
all
thought
i
had
laid
myself
to
sleep
on
a
bearskin
and
should
not
soon
rise
from
it
i
was
inquiring
of
the
ways
and
works
of
my
counterfeit
at
wesel
and
found
that
he
not
only
imitated
me
in
name
and
clothing
but
was
also
used
to
steal
by
night
whenever
he
could
find
a
chance
so
i
woke
up
again
unexpectedly
and
laid
my
plans
accordingly
now
i
had
by
little
and
little
trained
my
two
servants
like
and
they
were
so
true
to
me
that
each
at
need
would
have
run
through
fire
for
me
for
with
me
they
had
good
food
and
drink
and
gained
plenty
of
booty
one
of
these
i
sent
to
mine
enemy
at
wesel
to
pretend
that
because
i
that
had
been
his
master
was
now
begun
to
live
like
any
idler
and
had
sworn
never
again
to
ride
on
a
raid
he
cared
not
to
stay
longer
with
me
but
was
come
to
serve
him
since
he
that
had
put
on
the
huntsman
dress
in
his
master
stead
and
carried
himself
like
a
proper
soldier
and
he
knew
said
he
all
highways
and
byways
in
the
country
and
could
lay
many
a
plan
for
him
to
gain
good
booty
my
good
simple
fool
believed
it
all
and
let
himself
be
persuaded
to
take
the
fellow
into
his
service
so
on
a
certain
night
he
went
with
him
and
his
comrade
to
a
sheepfold
to
fetch
away
a
few
fat
wethers
but
there
was
i
and
my
other
servant
already
in
waiting
and
had
bribed
the
shepherd
to
fasten
up
his
dogs
and
to
suffer
the
to
burrow
their
way
into
the
shed
unhindered
for
i
would
say
grace
for
them
over
their
mutton
so
when
they
had
made
a
hole
through
the
wall
the
huntsman
of
wesel
would
have
it
that
my
servant
should
slip
in
first
but
says
he
no
for
there
might
well
be
one
on
the
watch
that
should
deal
me
one
on
the
head
i
see
plainly
ye
know
not
how
to
go
one
must
first
explore
and
therewith
drew
his
sword
and
hung
his
hat
on
the
point
and
pushing
it
through
the
hole
again
and
again
so
says
he
we
shall
find
out
if
the
good
man
be
at
home
or
not
this
ended
the
huntsman
of
wesel
was
the
first
to
creep
through
and
with
that
had
him
by
the
arm
which
held
his
sword
and
asked
would
he
cry
for
quarter
that
his
fellow
heard
and
would
have
run
for
it
but
i
who
knew
not
which
was
the
huntsman
and
was
swifter
of
foot
than
he
overtook
him
in
a
few
paces
so
i
asked
him
of
what
party
says
he
of
the
emperor
i
asked
what
regiment
i
am
of
the
emperor
side
is
a
rogue
that
denies
his
master
he
answered
we
are
of
the
dragoons
of
soest
and
are
come
to
fetch
a
couple
of
sheep
i
hope
brother
if
ye
be
of
the
emperor
party
too
ye
will
let
us
pass
i
answered
who
are
ye
then
from
soest
says
he
my
comrade
in
the
shed
is
the
huntsman
then
are
ye
rogues
said
i
or
why
do
ye
plunder
your
own
quarters
the
huntsman
of
soest
is
no
such
fool
as
to
let
himself
be
taken
in
a
nay
from
wesel
i
should
have
said
says
he
but
while
we
thus
disputed
together
came
my
servant
and
to
us
with
my
adversary
and
lookye
says
i
is
it
thus
we
come
together
thou
honourable
rascal
thou
were
it
not
that
i
respect
the
emperor
arms
which
thou
hast
undertaken
to
bear
against
the
enemy
i
would
incontinently
send
a
ball
through
thy
head
till
now
i
have
been
the
huntsman
of
soest
and
thee
i
count
for
a
rogue
unless
thou
take
one
of
these
swords
here
present
and
measurest
the
other
with
me
and
with
that
my
servant
who
like
had
on
horrible
devil
apparel
with
goat
horns
laid
a
couple
of
swords
at
our
feet
which
i
had
brought
from
soest
and
gave
the
huntsman
of
wesel
the
choice
to
take
which
he
would
whereat
the
poor
huntsman
was
so
dismayed
that
it
fared
with
him
as
with
me
at
hanau
when
i
spoiled
the
dance
he
and
his
comrade
trembled
like
wet
dogs
fell
on
their
knees
and
begged
for
pardon
but
growled
out
as
from
the
inside
of
a
hollow
pot
nay
ye
must
fight
or
i
will
break
the
neck
of
ye
o
honourable
sir
devil
says
the
huntsman
i
came
not
here
to
fight
oh
deliver
me
from
this
master
devil
and
i
will
do
what
thou
wilt
so
as
he
talked
thus
wildly
my
servant
put
one
sword
in
his
hand
and
gave
me
the
other
yet
he
trembled
so
sore
he
could
not
hold
it
now
the
moon
was
bright
and
the
shepherd
and
his
men
could
see
and
hear
all
from
out
their
hut
so
i
called
to
him
to
come
that
i
might
have
a
witness
of
this
bargain
but
when
he
came
he
made
as
though
he
saw
not
the
two
in
disguise
and
said
what
cause
had
i
to
bicker
so
long
with
these
two
fellows
in
his
sheepfold
if
i
had
aught
to
settle
with
them
i
might
do
it
elsewhere
for
our
business
concerned
him
not
at
all
he
paid
his
conterbission
regularly
every
month
and
hoped
therefore
he
might
live
in
peace
with
his
sheep
to
the
two
fellows
he
said
why
did
they
so
suffer
one
man
to
plague
them
and
did
not
knock
me
on
the
head
at
once
why
said
i
thou
rascal
they
would
have
stolen
thy
sheep
then
let
the
devil
wring
their
necks
for
them
says
the
peasant
and
away
he
went
with
that
i
would
come
to
the
fighting
again
but
my
poor
huntsman
could
for
sheer
terror
no
longer
keep
his
feet
so
that
i
pitied
him
yea
he
and
his
comrade
uttered
such
piteous
plaints
that
in
a
word
i
forgave
and
pardoned
him
all
but
would
not
so
be
satisfied
but
scratched
the
huntsman
so
grievously
in
the
face
that
he
looked
as
he
had
been
at
dinner
with
the
cats
and
with
this
poor
revenge
i
must
be
content
so
the
huntsman
vanished
from
wesel
for
he
was
sore
shamed
inasmuch
as
his
comrade
declared
everywhere
and
confirmed
it
with
horrible
oaths
that
i
had
in
real
truth
two
devils
in
the
flesh
that
waited
on
me
and
so
was
i
more
feared
and
contrariwise
less
loved
how
the
great
god
jupiter
was
captured
and
how
he
revealed
the
counsels
of
the
gods
of
that
i
was
soon
aware
and
therefore
did
i
do
away
my
godless
way
of
life
and
give
myself
over
to
religion
and
good
living
is
true
i
would
ride
on
forays
as
before
yet
now
i
shewed
myself
so
courteous
and
kindly
towards
friend
and
foe
that
all
i
had
to
deal
with
deemed
it
must
be
a
different
man
from
him
they
had
heard
of
nay
more
i
made
an
end
of
my
superfluous
expense
and
got
together
many
bright
ducats
and
jewels
which
i
hid
here
and
there
in
hollow
trees
in
the
country
round
soest
for
so
the
in
that
town
advised
me
and
told
me
likewise
i
had
more
enemies
in
soest
and
in
mine
own
regiment
than
outside
the
town
and
in
the
enemy
garrisons
and
these
said
she
were
all
plotting
against
me
and
my
money
and
when
was
noised
in
this
place
or
that
that
the
huntsman
was
off
and
away
presently
i
was
all
unexpectedly
at
the
elbow
of
them
that
so
flattered
themselves
and
before
one
village
was
rightly
certain
that
i
had
done
mischief
in
another
itself
found
that
i
was
close
at
hand
for
i
was
everywhere
like
a
whirlwind
now
here
now
there
so
that
i
was
more
talked
of
than
ever
and
others
gave
themselves
out
to
be
me
now
it
happened
that
i
lay
with
musquets
not
far
from
dorsten
and
waited
for
a
convoy
that
should
come
to
the
town
and
as
was
my
wont
i
stood
sentry
myself
as
being
near
the
enemy
to
me
there
came
a
man
all
alone
very
well
dressed
and
flourishing
a
cane
he
had
in
his
hand
in
strange
wise
nor
could
i
understand
aught
he
said
but
this
once
for
all
will
i
punish
the
world
that
will
not
render
me
divine
honours
from
that
i
guessed
this
might
be
some
mighty
prince
that
went
thus
disguised
to
find
out
his
subjects
ways
and
works
and
now
proposed
duly
to
punish
the
same
as
not
having
found
them
to
his
liking
so
i
thought
if
this
man
be
of
the
opposite
party
it
means
a
good
ransom
but
if
not
thou
canst
treat
him
so
courteously
and
so
charm
away
his
heart
that
he
shall
be
profitable
to
thee
all
thy
life
long
with
that
i
leapt
out
upon
him
presented
my
gun
at
him
at
and
says
i
your
worship
will
please
to
walk
before
me
into
yonder
wood
if
he
will
not
be
treated
as
an
enemy
so
he
answered
very
gravely
to
such
treatment
my
likes
are
not
accustomed
but
i
pushed
him
very
politely
along
and
your
honour
said
i
will
not
for
once
refuse
to
bow
to
the
necessities
of
the
times
so
when
i
had
brought
him
safely
to
my
people
in
the
wood
and
had
set
my
sentries
again
i
asked
him
who
he
was
to
which
he
answered
very
haughtily
i
need
not
ask
that
for
i
knew
already
he
was
a
great
god
i
thought
he
might
perhaps
know
me
and
might
be
a
nobleman
of
soest
that
thus
spoke
to
rally
me
for
is
the
custom
to
jeer
at
the
people
of
soest
about
their
great
idol
with
the
golden
apron
but
soon
i
was
aware
that
instead
of
a
prince
i
had
caught
a
madman
one
that
had
studied
too
much
and
gone
mad
over
poetry
for
when
he
grew
a
little
more
acquainted
with
me
he
told
me
plainly
he
was
the
great
god
jupiter
himself
now
did
i
heartily
wish
i
had
never
made
this
capture
but
since
i
had
my
fool
there
i
must
needs
keep
him
till
we
should
depart
so
as
the
time
otherwise
would
have
been
tedious
i
thought
i
would
humour
the
fellow
and
make
his
gifts
of
use
to
me
so
i
said
to
him
now
worshipful
jove
how
comes
it
that
thy
high
divinity
thus
leaves
his
heavenly
throne
and
descends
to
earth
forgive
o
jupiter
my
question
which
thou
mightest
deem
one
of
curiosity
for
we
be
also
akin
to
the
heavenly
gods
and
nought
but
born
of
fauns
and
nymphs
to
whom
this
secret
shall
ever
remain
a
secret
i
swear
to
thee
by
the
styx
answered
jupiter
thou
shouldst
not
know
a
word
of
the
secret
wert
thou
not
so
like
to
my
ganymede
even
wert
thou
own
son
but
for
his
sake
i
communicate
to
thee
this
that
a
great
outcry
concerning
the
sins
of
the
world
is
come
up
to
me
through
the
clouds
upon
which
was
decided
in
the
council
of
all
the
gods
that
i
could
justly
destroy
all
the
world
with
a
flood
but
inasmuch
as
i
have
always
had
a
special
favour
to
the
human
race
and
moreover
at
all
times
shew
kindness
rather
than
severity
i
am
now
wandering
around
to
learn
for
myself
the
ways
and
works
of
men
and
though
i
find
all
worse
than
i
expected
yet
am
i
not
minded
to
destroy
all
men
at
once
and
without
distinction
but
to
punish
only
those
that
deserve
punishment
and
thereafter
to
bend
the
remainder
to
my
will
i
must
needs
laugh
yet
checked
myself
and
said
alas
jupiter
thy
toil
and
trouble
will
be
i
fear
all
in
vain
unless
thou
punish
the
world
with
water
as
before
or
with
fire
for
if
thou
sendest
a
war
thither
run
together
all
vile
and
abandoned
rogues
that
do
but
torment
peaceable
and
pious
men
an
thou
sendest
a
famine
is
but
a
godsend
for
the
usurers
for
then
is
their
corn
most
valuable
and
if
thou
sendest
a
pestilence
then
the
greedy
and
all
the
rest
of
mankind
do
find
their
account
for
then
do
they
inherit
much
so
must
thou
destroy
the
whole
world
root
and
branch
if
thou
wilt
punish
at
all
of
the
german
hero
that
shall
conquer
the
whole
world
and
bring
peace
to
all
nations
so
jupiter
answered
thou
speakest
of
the
matter
like
a
mere
man
as
if
thou
didst
not
know
that
is
possible
for
us
gods
so
to
manage
things
that
only
the
wicked
shall
be
punished
and
the
good
saved
i
will
raise
up
a
german
hero
that
shall
accomplish
all
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
he
shall
destroy
all
evil
men
and
preserve
and
exalt
the
righteous
yea
said
i
but
such
a
hero
must
needs
have
soldiers
and
where
soldiers
are
there
is
war
and
where
war
is
there
must
the
innocent
suffer
as
well
as
the
guilty
oho
says
jupiter
be
ye
earthly
gods
minded
like
earthly
men
that
ye
can
understand
so
little
for
i
will
send
such
a
hero
that
he
shall
have
need
of
no
soldiers
and
yet
shall
reform
the
whole
world
at
his
birth
i
will
grant
to
him
a
body
well
formed
and
stronger
than
had
ever
hercules
adorned
to
the
full
with
princeliness
wisdom
and
understanding
to
this
shall
venus
add
so
comely
a
face
that
he
shall
excel
narcissus
adonis
and
even
my
ganymede
and
she
shall
grant
to
him
besides
his
other
fine
parts
dignity
charm
and
presence
excelling
all
and
so
make
him
beloved
by
all
the
world
for
which
cause
i
will
look
more
kindly
upon
it
in
the
hour
of
his
birth
mercury
too
shall
endow
him
with
incomparable
cleverness
and
the
inconstant
moon
shall
be
to
him
not
harmful
but
useful
for
she
shall
implant
in
him
an
invincible
swiftness
pallas
athene
shall
rear
him
on
parnassus
and
vulcan
shall
under
the
influence
of
mars
forge
for
him
his
weapons
and
specially
a
sword
with
which
he
shall
conquer
the
whole
world
and
make
an
end
of
all
the
godless
without
the
help
of
a
single
man
as
a
soldier
for
he
shall
need
no
assistance
every
town
shall
tremble
at
his
coming
and
every
fortress
otherwise
unconquerable
he
shall
have
in
his
power
in
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
in
a
word
he
shall
have
the
rule
over
the
greatest
potentates
of
the
world
and
so
nobly
bear
sway
over
earth
and
sea
that
both
gods
and
men
shall
rejoice
thereat
yea
said
i
but
how
can
the
destruction
of
all
the
godless
and
rule
over
the
whole
world
be
accomplished
without
specially
great
power
and
a
strong
arm
o
jupiter
i
tell
thee
plainly
i
can
understand
these
things
less
than
any
mere
mortal
man
at
that
says
jupiter
i
marvel
not
for
thou
knowest
not
what
power
my
hero
sword
will
have
vulcan
shall
make
it
of
the
same
materials
of
which
he
doth
forge
my
thunderbolts
and
so
direct
its
virtues
that
my
hero
if
he
do
but
draw
it
and
wave
it
in
the
air
can
cut
off
the
heads
of
a
whole
armada
though
they
be
hidden
behind
a
mountain
or
be
a
whole
swiss
mile
distant
from
him
and
so
the
poor
devils
shall
lie
there
without
heads
before
they
know
what
has
befallen
them
and
when
he
shall
begin
his
triumphal
progress
and
shall
come
before
a
town
or
a
fortress
then
shall
he
use
tamburlaine
vein
and
for
a
sign
that
he
is
there
for
peace
and
for
the
furthering
of
all
good
shall
shew
a
white
flag
then
if
they
come
forth
to
him
and
are
content
is
well
if
not
then
will
he
draw
his
sword
and
by
its
virtue
as
before
described
will
hew
off
the
heads
of
all
enchanters
and
sorceresses
throughout
the
town
and
then
raise
a
red
flag
then
if
they
be
still
obstinate
he
shall
destroy
all
murderers
usurers
thieves
rogues
adulterers
whores
and
knaves
in
the
said
manner
and
then
hoist
a
black
flag
whereupon
if
those
that
yet
remain
in
the
town
refuse
to
come
to
him
and
humbly
submit
then
shall
he
destroy
the
whole
town
as
a
and
disobedient
folk
yet
shall
he
only
execute
them
that
have
hindered
the
others
and
been
the
cause
that
the
people
would
not
submit
so
shall
he
go
from
country
to
country
and
give
each
town
the
country
that
lies
around
it
to
rule
in
peace
and
from
each
town
in
all
germany
choose
out
two
of
the
wisest
and
learnedest
men
to
form
his
parliament
shall
reconcile
the
towns
with
each
other
for
ever
shall
do
away
all
villenage
and
also
all
tolls
excises
interest
taxes
and
octrois
throughout
germany
and
take
such
order
that
none
shall
ever
again
hear
of
forced
work
contributions
benevolences
and
other
burdens
of
the
people
but
that
men
shall
live
happier
than
in
the
elysian
fields
and
then
says
jupiter
will
i
often
assemble
all
olympus
and
come
down
to
visit
the
germans
to
delight
myself
among
their
vines
and
and
there
will
i
set
helicon
on
their
borders
and
establish
the
muses
anew
thereon
germany
will
i
bless
with
all
plenty
yea
more
than
arabia
felix
mesopotamia
and
the
land
of
damascus
then
will
i
forswear
the
greek
language
and
only
speak
german
and
in
a
word
shew
myself
so
good
a
german
that
in
the
end
i
shall
grant
to
them
as
once
i
did
to
the
romans
the
rule
over
all
the
earth
but
said
i
great
jupiter
what
will
princes
and
lords
say
to
this
if
this
future
hero
so
violently
take
from
them
their
rights
and
hand
them
over
to
the
towns
will
they
not
resist
with
force
or
at
least
protest
against
it
before
gods
and
men
the
hero
answered
jupiter
will
trouble
himself
little
on
that
score
he
will
divide
all
the
great
into
three
classes
them
which
have
lived
wickedly
and
set
an
evil
example
he
will
punish
together
with
the
commons
for
no
earthly
power
can
withstand
his
sword
to
the
rest
he
will
give
the
choice
whether
to
stay
in
the
land
or
not
they
that
love
their
fatherland
and
abide
must
live
like
the
commons
but
the
german
people
way
of
living
shall
then
be
more
plentiful
and
comfortable
than
is
now
the
life
and
household
of
a
king
yea
they
shall
be
one
and
all
like
fabricius
that
would
not
share
king
pyrrhus
his
kingdom
because
he
loved
his
country
and
honour
and
virtue
too
much
and
so
much
for
the
second
class
but
as
to
the
third
which
will
still
be
lords
and
rulers
them
will
he
lead
through
hungary
and
italy
into
moldavia
wallachia
into
macedonia
thrace
and
greece
yea
over
the
hellespont
into
asia
and
conquer
these
lands
for
them
give
them
as
helpers
all
them
that
live
by
war
in
all
germany
and
make
them
all
kings
then
will
he
take
constantinople
in
one
day
and
lay
the
heads
of
all
turks
that
will
not
be
converted
and
become
obedient
before
their
feet
then
will
he
again
set
up
the
roman
empire
and
so
betake
himself
again
to
germany
and
with
his
lords
of
parliament
whom
as
i
have
said
he
shall
choose
in
pairs
from
every
city
in
germany
and
name
them
the
chiefs
and
fathers
of
his
german
fatherland
build
a
city
in
the
midst
of
germany
that
shall
be
far
greater
than
manoah
in
america
and
richer
than
was
jerusalem
in
solomon
time
whose
walls
shall
be
as
high
as
the
mountains
of
tirol
and
its
ditches
as
broad
as
the
sea
between
spain
and
africa
and
there
will
he
build
a
temple
entirely
of
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
and
sapphires
and
in
the
treasury
that
he
shall
there
build
will
he
gather
together
rarities
from
the
whole
world
out
of
the
gifts
that
the
kings
in
china
and
in
persia
the
great
mogul
in
the
east
indies
the
great
khan
of
tartary
prester
john
in
africa
and
the
great
czar
in
muscovy
will
send
to
him
yea
the
turkish
emperor
would
be
yet
more
ready
to
serve
him
if
it
were
not
that
my
hero
will
have
taken
his
empire
from
him
and
given
it
as
a
fief
to
the
roman
emperor
then
i
asked
my
friend
jupiter
what
in
such
case
would
become
of
the
christian
kings
so
he
answered
those
of
england
sweden
and
denmark
because
they
are
of
german
race
and
descent
and
those
of
spain
france
and
portugal
because
the
germans
of
old
conquered
and
ruled
in
those
lands
shall
receive
their
crowns
kingdoms
and
incorporated
lands
in
fee
as
fiefs
of
the
german
nation
and
then
will
there
be
as
in
augustus
time
a
perpetual
peace
between
all
nations
how
he
shall
reconcile
all
religions
and
cast
them
in
the
same
mould
now
who
also
listened
to
us
had
wellnigh
enraged
jupiter
and
spoiled
the
whole
affair
for
said
he
yea
yea
and
then
be
in
germany
as
in
fairyland
where
it
rains
muscatels
and
nought
else
and
where
twopenny
pies
grow
in
the
night
like
mushrooms
and
i
too
shall
have
to
eat
with
both
cheeks
full
at
once
like
a
thresher
and
drink
myself
blind
with
malvoisie
yea
truly
said
jupiter
and
that
the
more
because
i
will
curse
thee
with
the
undying
hunger
of
erysichthon
for
methinks
thou
art
one
of
them
that
do
deride
my
majesty
and
to
me
said
he
i
deemed
i
was
among
only
but
meseems
i
have
chanced
upon
a
momus
or
a
zoilus
the
most
envious
creatures
in
the
world
is
one
to
reveal
to
such
traitors
the
decrees
of
heaven
and
so
to
cast
pearls
before
swine
so
i
saw
plainly
he
would
not
willingly
brook
laughter
and
therefore
kept
down
mine
own
as
best
i
could
and
most
gracious
jupiter
said
i
thou
wilt
not
by
reason
of
a
rude
indiscretion
conceal
from
thy
ganymede
how
things
are
further
to
happen
in
germany
no
no
said
he
but
i
command
this
mocker
who
is
like
to
theon
to
bridle
his
evil
tongue
in
future
lest
i
turn
him
to
a
stone
as
mercury
did
battus
but
do
thou
confess
to
me
thou
art
truly
my
ganymede
and
that
my
jealous
juno
hath
driven
thee
from
heaven
in
my
absence
so
i
promised
to
tell
him
all
when
i
should
have
heard
what
i
desired
to
know
thereupon
dear
ganymede
says
he
for
deny
not
that
thou
art
he
in
those
days
shall
be
as
common
in
germany
as
is
now
and
every
shall
carry
the
philosophers
stone
about
with
him
yea
said
i
but
how
can
germany
be
so
long
in
peace
with
all
these
different
religions
will
not
the
opposing
clergy
urge
on
their
flocks
and
so
hatch
another
war
no
no
says
jupiter
my
hero
will
know
how
to
meet
that
difficulty
cleverly
and
before
all
things
to
unite
all
christian
religions
in
the
world
o
wonderful
said
i
that
were
indeed
a
great
work
how
could
it
come
about
i
will
with
all
my
heart
reveal
it
to
thee
answered
jupiter
for
after
my
hero
hath
made
peace
for
all
mankind
he
will
address
all
the
heads
of
the
christian
world
both
spiritual
and
temporal
in
a
most
moving
speech
and
so
excellently
impress
upon
them
their
hitherto
most
pernicious
divisions
in
belief
that
of
themselves
they
will
desire
a
general
reconciliation
and
give
over
to
him
the
accomplishment
of
such
according
to
his
own
great
wisdom
then
will
he
gather
together
the
most
skilful
most
learned
and
most
pious
theologians
of
all
religions
and
appoint
for
them
a
place
as
did
once
ptolemy
for
the
translators
in
a
cheerful
and
yet
quiet
spot
where
one
can
consider
weighty
matters
undisturbed
and
there
provide
them
all
with
meat
and
drink
and
all
necessaries
and
command
them
so
soon
as
possible
and
yet
with
the
ripest
and
most
careful
consideration
first
to
lay
aside
the
strifes
that
there
be
between
their
religions
and
next
to
set
down
in
writing
and
with
full
clearness
the
right
true
holy
christian
religion
in
accordance
with
holy
writ
and
with
most
ancient
tradition
the
recognised
sense
of
the
fathers
at
which
time
pluto
will
sorely
scratch
his
head
as
fearing
the
lessening
of
his
kingdom
yea
and
will
devise
all
manner
of
plans
and
tricks
to
foist
in
an
and
if
not
to
stop
the
whole
thing
yet
at
least
to
postpone
it
that
is
for
ever
so
will
he
hint
to
each
theologian
of
his
interest
his
order
his
peaceful
life
his
wife
and
child
and
his
privileges
and
aught
else
that
might
sway
his
inclinations
but
my
brave
hero
also
will
not
be
idle
he
will
so
long
as
this
council
shall
last
have
all
the
bells
in
christendom
rung
and
so
call
all
christian
people
to
pray
without
ceasing
to
the
almighty
and
to
ask
for
the
sending
of
the
spirit
of
truth
and
if
he
shall
see
that
one
or
another
doth
allow
himself
to
be
tempted
by
pluto
then
will
he
plague
the
whole
assembly
with
hunger
as
in
a
roman
conclave
and
if
they
yet
delay
to
complete
so
holy
a
work
then
will
he
preach
them
all
a
sermon
through
the
gallows
or
shew
them
his
wonderful
sword
and
so
first
with
kindness
but
at
last
with
severity
and
threats
bring
them
to
come
to
the
business
in
hand
and
no
longer
as
before
to
befool
the
world
with
their
false
doctrines
so
when
unity
is
arrived
at
then
will
he
proclaim
a
great
festival
and
declare
to
the
whole
world
this
purified
religion
and
whosoever
opposes
it
him
will
he
torment
with
pitch
and
sulphur
or
smear
that
heretic
with
and
present
him
to
pluto
as
a
new
year
gift
and
now
dear
ganymede
thou
knowest
all
thou
didst
desire
to
know
and
now
tell
me
in
turn
the
reason
why
thou
hast
left
heaven
where
thou
hast
poured
me
so
many
a
draught
of
nectar
how
the
embassy
of
the
fleas
fared
with
jupiter
now
methought
was
possible
this
fellow
might
be
no
such
fool
as
he
pretended
but
might
be
serving
me
as
i
had
served
others
in
hanau
to
escape
from
us
the
better
so
i
determined
to
put
him
in
a
passion
for
in
such
plight
it
is
easiest
to
know
a
real
madman
and
says
i
the
reason
i
am
come
down
from
heaven
is
that
i
missed
thee
there
and
so
took
daedalus
wings
and
flew
down
to
earth
to
seek
thee
but
when
i
came
to
ask
for
thee
i
found
thee
in
all
places
but
of
ill
repute
for
zoilus
and
momus
have
throughout
the
world
so
slandered
thee
and
all
the
other
gods
and
decried
ye
as
wanton
and
stinking
that
ye
have
lost
all
credit
with
mankind
thyself
say
they
beest
a
lousy
adulterous
caperer
after
how
canst
thou
then
punish
the
world
for
such
vices
vulcan
they
say
is
but
a
poltroon
that
let
pass
mars
adultery
without
proper
revenge
and
how
can
that
halting
cuckold
forge
any
weapons
of
note
venus
too
is
for
her
unchastity
the
most
infamous
baggage
in
the
world
and
how
can
she
endow
another
with
grace
and
favour
mars
they
say
is
but
a
murderer
and
a
robber
apollo
a
shameless
lecher
mercury
an
idle
chatterer
thief
and
pander
priapus
filth
hercules
a
brainsick
ruffian
and
in
a
word
the
whole
crew
of
the
gods
so
ill
famed
that
they
should
of
right
be
lodged
nowhere
but
in
augeas
stable
which
even
without
them
stinks
in
the
nostrils
of
all
the
world
aha
says
jupiter
and
who
would
wonder
if
i
laid
aside
my
graciousness
and
punished
these
wretched
slanderers
and
blasphemous
liars
with
thunder
and
lightning
how
thinkest
thou
my
true
and
beloved
ganymede
shall
i
curse
these
chatterers
with
eternal
thirst
like
tantalus
or
hang
them
up
with
that
loose
talker
daphitas
on
mount
thorax
or
grind
them
with
anaxarchus
in
a
mortar
or
set
them
in
phalaris
bull
of
agrigent
nay
nay
ganymede
all
these
plagues
and
punishments
together
are
too
little
i
will
fill
box
anew
and
empty
it
upon
the
rogues
heads
then
nemesis
shall
wake
the
furies
and
send
them
at
their
heels
and
hercules
shall
borrow
cerberus
from
pluto
and
hunt
those
wicked
knaves
with
him
like
wolves
and
when
i
have
in
this
wise
chased
and
tormented
them
enough
then
will
i
bind
them
fast
with
hesiod
and
homer
to
a
pillar
in
hell
and
there
have
them
chastised
for
ever
without
pity
by
the
furies
now
while
jupiter
thus
spake
he
began
to
make
a
hunt
for
the
fleas
he
had
upon
him
for
these
as
one
might
perceive
did
plague
him
sore
and
as
he
did
so
he
cried
away
with
ye
ye
little
tormentors
i
swear
to
ye
by
styx
ye
shall
never
have
that
that
ye
so
earnestly
desire
so
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
such
words
he
answered
the
nation
of
the
fleas
as
soon
as
they
learned
he
was
come
on
earth
had
sent
their
ambassadors
to
compliment
him
and
there
had
complained
to
him
that
though
he
had
assigned
to
them
the
dogs
coats
as
a
dwelling
yet
on
account
of
certain
properties
common
to
women
some
poor
souls
went
astray
and
trespassed
on
the
ladies
furs
and
such
poor
wandering
creatures
were
by
the
women
evil
entreated
caught
and
not
only
murdered
but
first
so
miserably
martyred
and
crushed
between
their
fingers
that
it
might
move
the
heart
of
a
stone
yea
said
jupiter
further
they
did
present
their
case
to
me
so
movingly
and
piteously
that
i
must
needs
have
sympathy
with
them
and
so
promised
them
help
yet
on
condition
i
should
first
hear
the
women
to
that
they
objected
that
if
was
allowed
to
the
women
to
plead
their
cause
and
to
oppose
them
they
knew
well
they
with
their
poisonous
tongues
would
either
impose
upon
my
goodness
and
and
outcry
the
fleas
themselves
or
by
their
sweet
words
and
their
beauty
would
befool
me
and
lead
me
astray
to
a
wrong
judgment
but
if
i
must
allow
the
women
to
hunt
catch
and
with
the
hunters
privilege
to
slay
them
in
their
preserves
then
their
petition
was
that
they
might
in
future
be
executed
in
honourable
wise
and
either
cut
down
with
a
like
oxen
or
snared
like
game
and
no
longer
to
be
so
scandalously
crushed
between
the
fingers
and
so
broken
on
the
wheel
by
which
means
their
own
limbs
were
made
instruments
of
torture
gentlemen
said
i
ye
must
be
greatly
tormented
when
they
thus
tyrannise
over
ye
yea
truly
said
they
they
be
so
envious
of
us
is
it
right
can
they
not
suffer
us
in
their
territories
for
many
of
them
so
cleanse
their
with
brushes
combs
soap
and
lye
and
other
like
things
that
we
are
compelled
to
leave
our
fatherland
and
to
seek
other
dwellings
thereupon
i
allowed
them
to
lodge
with
me
and
to
make
my
person
feel
their
presence
their
ways
and
works
that
i
might
judge
accordingly
and
then
the
rascally
crew
began
so
to
plague
me
that
as
ye
have
seen
i
must
again
be
rid
of
them
i
will
give
them
a
privilege
but
only
this
that
the
women
may
squeeze
them
and
crush
them
as
much
as
they
will
and
if
i
catch
any
so
pestilent
a
customer
i
will
deal
with
him
no
better
how
the
huntsman
again
secured
honour
and
booty
now
might
we
not
laugh
as
heartily
as
we
would
both
because
we
must
keep
quiet
and
because
this
good
fool
liked
it
not
wherefore
came
nigh
to
burst
and
just
then
our
man
that
we
had
posted
in
a
tree
called
to
us
that
he
saw
somewhat
coming
afar
off
so
i
climbed
the
tree
myself
and
saw
through
my
it
must
be
the
carriers
for
whom
we
lay
in
wait
they
had
no
one
on
foot
but
some
thirty
odd
troopers
for
escort
and
so
i
might
easily
judge
they
would
not
go
through
the
wood
wherein
we
lay
but
would
do
their
best
to
keep
the
open
and
there
we
should
have
no
advantage
over
them
though
there
was
even
there
an
awkward
piece
of
road
that
led
through
the
clearing
some
six
hundred
paces
from
us
and
three
hundred
paces
from
the
end
of
the
wood
or
hill
now
it
vexed
me
to
have
lain
there
so
long
for
nought
or
at
best
to
have
captured
only
a
fool
and
so
i
quickly
laid
me
another
plan
and
that
turned
out
well
for
from
our
place
of
ambush
there
ran
a
brook
in
a
cleft
of
the
ground
which
it
was
easy
to
ride
along
down
to
the
level
country
the
mouth
of
this
i
occupied
with
twenty
men
took
my
post
with
them
and
bade
stay
in
the
place
where
we
had
been
posted
to
advantage
and
ordered
each
one
of
my
fellows
when
the
escort
should
come
that
each
should
aim
at
his
man
and
commanded
also
that
some
should
shoot
and
some
should
hold
their
fire
for
a
reserve
some
old
veterans
perceived
what
i
intended
and
how
i
guessed
that
the
escort
would
come
that
way
as
having
no
cause
for
caution
and
because
certainly
no
peasant
had
been
in
such
a
place
for
a
hundred
years
but
others
that
believed
i
could
bewitch
for
at
that
time
i
was
in
great
reputation
on
that
account
thought
i
would
conjure
the
enemy
into
our
hands
yet
here
i
needed
no
devil
arts
only
my
for
even
as
the
escort
riding
pretty
close
together
was
just
about
to
pass
by
us
he
began
at
my
order
to
bellow
most
horribly
like
an
ox
and
to
neigh
like
a
horse
till
the
whole
wood
echoed
therewith
and
any
man
would
have
sworn
there
were
horses
and
cattle
there
so
when
the
escort
heard
that
they
thought
to
gain
booty
and
to
snap
up
somewhat
which
yet
was
hard
to
find
in
such
a
country
so
laid
waste
so
altogether
they
rode
so
hard
and
disorderly
into
our
ambush
as
if
each
would
be
the
first
to
get
the
hardest
blow
and
this
made
them
ride
so
close
that
in
the
first
salute
we
gave
them
thirteen
saddles
were
emptied
and
some
that
fell
were
crushed
under
the
horses
hoofs
then
came
leaping
down
the
ravine
and
crying
huntsman
here
at
this
the
fellows
were
yet
more
terrified
and
so
dismayed
that
they
would
ride
neither
backward
forward
nor
sideways
but
leapt
down
and
tried
to
escape
on
foot
yet
i
had
them
all
seventeen
prisoners
with
the
lieutenant
that
had
commanded
them
and
then
attacked
the
waggons
where
i
unharnessed
horses
and
yet
got
only
a
few
bales
of
silk
and
holland
for
i
dared
not
spare
the
time
to
plunder
the
dead
far
less
to
search
the
waggons
well
for
the
waggoners
were
up
and
away
on
the
horses
as
soon
as
the
action
began
and
so
might
i
be
betrayed
at
dorsten
and
caught
again
on
the
way
back
so
when
we
had
packed
up
our
plunder
comes
jupiter
from
the
wood
and
cried
to
us
would
his
ganymede
desert
him
i
answered
him
yes
if
he
would
not
grant
the
fleas
the
privilege
they
demanded
sooner
says
he
would
i
see
them
all
lying
in
at
that
i
must
needs
laugh
and
because
in
any
case
i
had
horses
to
spare
i
had
him
set
on
one
yet
as
he
could
ride
no
better
than
a
tailor
i
must
have
him
bound
upon
his
horse
and
then
he
told
us
our
skirmish
had
reminded
him
of
that
of
the
lapithae
and
the
centaurs
at
pirithous
wedding
so
when
all
was
over
and
we
galloping
away
with
our
prisoners
as
if
we
were
pursued
the
lieutenant
we
had
captured
began
to
consider
what
a
fault
he
had
committed
as
having
delivered
so
bold
a
troop
of
riders
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
and
given
over
thirteen
brave
fellows
to
be
butchered
and
so
being
desperate
he
refused
the
quarter
i
had
given
him
and
would
fain
have
compelled
me
to
have
him
shot
for
he
thought
that
not
only
would
this
mistake
turn
to
his
great
shame
and
he
be
answerable
but
also
would
hinder
his
advancement
even
if
it
came
not
to
this
that
he
must
pay
for
his
error
with
his
head
so
i
talked
with
him
and
shewed
him
that
with
many
a
good
soldier
inconstant
fortune
had
played
her
tricks
yet
had
i
never
seen
any
one
that
therefore
had
been
driven
desperate
and
that
so
to
act
were
a
sign
of
faintheartedness
for
brave
soldiers
were
ever
devising
how
to
make
up
for
losses
sustained
nor
should
he
ever
bring
me
to
break
my
plighted
word
or
to
commit
so
shameful
a
deed
against
all
righteousness
and
against
the
custom
and
tradition
of
honourable
soldiers
when
he
saw
i
would
not
do
it
he
began
to
revile
me
in
the
hope
to
move
me
to
anger
and
said
i
had
not
fought
with
him
honestly
and
openly
but
like
a
rogue
and
a
footpad
and
had
stolen
the
lives
of
his
soldiers
like
a
thief
and
at
this
his
own
fellows
that
we
had
captured
were
mightily
afraid
and
mine
so
wroth
that
they
would
have
riddled
him
like
a
sieve
if
i
had
allowed
it
and
i
had
enough
to
do
to
prevent
it
yet
i
was
in
no
wise
moved
at
his
talk
but
called
both
friend
and
foe
to
witness
of
what
happened
and
had
him
bound
and
guarded
as
a
madman
but
promised
him
so
soon
as
we
came
to
our
camp
and
if
my
officers
permitted
to
equip
him
with
mine
own
horses
and
weapons
of
which
he
should
have
the
choice
and
prove
to
him
in
open
field
with
sword
and
pistol
that
allowed
in
war
to
use
craft
against
the
adversary
and
asked
him
why
he
had
not
stayed
with
the
waggons
which
he
was
ordered
to
do
or
if
he
must
needs
see
what
was
in
the
wood
why
he
had
not
made
a
proper
reconnaissance
which
had
been
better
for
him
than
now
to
begin
to
play
fool
tricks
to
which
no
one
would
take
heed
herein
both
friend
and
foe
approved
me
right
and
said
that
among
a
hundred
partisans
they
had
never
met
one
that
would
not
for
such
words
of
reviling
have
not
only
shot
the
lieutenant
dead
but
would
have
sent
all
the
prisoners
to
the
grave
after
him
so
next
morning
i
brought
my
prisoners
and
plunder
safely
to
soest
and
gained
more
honour
and
fame
from
this
foray
than
ever
before
for
each
one
said
this
will
prove
another
young
john
de
werth
which
tickled
me
greatly
yet
would
not
the
commandant
permit
me
to
exchange
shots
or
to
fight
with
the
lieutenant
for
he
said
i
had
twice
overcome
him
and
the
more
my
triumphs
thus
increased
the
more
grew
the
envy
of
those
that
in
any
case
would
have
grudged
me
my
luck
how
he
found
the
devil
in
the
trough
and
how
got
fine
horses
now
i
could
by
no
means
be
rid
of
my
jupiter
for
the
commandant
would
have
none
of
him
as
a
pigeon
not
worth
the
plucking
but
said
he
made
me
a
free
gift
of
him
so
now
i
had
a
fool
of
mine
own
and
needed
to
buy
none
though
a
year
before
i
must
needs
allow
others
to
treat
me
as
such
so
wondrous
is
fortune
and
so
changeable
the
times
even
now
had
the
lice
troubled
me
and
now
had
i
the
very
god
of
fleas
in
my
power
half
a
year
before
was
i
serving
a
miserable
dragoon
as
page
and
now
i
had
command
of
two
servants
that
called
me
master
and
so
i
reflected
at
times
that
nothing
is
so
certain
in
this
world
as
its
uncertainty
and
so
must
i
fear
if
ever
fortune
should
let
loose
her
hornets
upon
me
it
would
altogether
overwhelm
my
present
happiness
now
just
then
count
von
der
wahl
as
colonel
in
command
of
the
westphalian
circle
was
collecting
troops
from
all
the
garrisons
to
make
a
cavalry
expedition
through
the
bishopric
of
münster
towards
the
vecht
meppen
lingen
and
such
places
but
specially
to
drive
off
two
companies
of
hessian
troopers
in
the
bishopric
of
paderborn
that
lay
two
miles
from
the
city
and
had
there
done
our
people
much
damage
so
was
i
ordered
out
with
our
dragoons
and
when
a
few
troops
had
been
collected
at
ham
we
beat
up
the
quarters
of
the
said
troopers
which
were
but
an
village
till
the
rest
of
our
people
came
they
tried
to
escape
but
we
drove
them
back
into
their
nest
and
offered
them
to
let
them
go
without
horse
or
weapons
but
with
the
clothes
on
their
backs
to
this
they
would
not
agree
but
would
defend
themselves
with
their
carbines
like
musqueteers
so
it
came
to
that
that
in
the
same
night
i
must
try
what
luck
i
had
in
storming
for
the
dragoons
led
the
way
and
my
luck
was
so
good
that
i
together
with
was
among
the
first
to
come
into
the
town
and
that
without
hurt
and
we
soon
cleared
the
streets
for
all
that
bore
arms
were
cut
down
and
the
citizens
had
no
stomach
for
fighting
so
we
entered
the
houses
then
said
we
should
choose
a
house
before
which
a
big
heap
of
dung
stood
for
in
such
the
rich
curmudgeons
were
wont
to
dwell
with
whom
commonly
officers
were
billeted
on
such
a
one
we
seized
and
there
would
first
visit
the
stable
and
i
the
house
on
the
condition
each
should
share
with
the
other
whatever
he
could
lay
hands
on
so
then
each
lit
his
torch
and
i
called
to
the
master
of
the
house
but
had
no
answer
for
all
had
hid
themselves
but
came
upon
a
room
wherein
was
nought
but
an
empty
bed
and
a
covered
this
i
knocked
open
in
hopes
to
find
somewhat
valuable
but
as
i
raised
the
cover
a
thing
rose
up
against
me
which
i
took
for
lucifer
himself
nay
i
can
swear
i
was
never
in
my
life
so
terrified
as
i
was
then
when
i
so
unawares
beheld
this
black
devil
may
all
the
powers
of
hell
take
thee
i
cried
in
my
fear
and
raised
my
hatchet
wherewith
i
had
broke
open
the
trough
yet
had
not
the
heart
to
split
the
creature
skull
so
down
he
knelt
raised
his
hands
to
me
and
says
he
o
massa
i
beg
by
de
good
god
gib
me
my
life
with
that
i
first
knew
was
no
devil
for
he
spake
of
god
and
begged
for
his
life
so
i
bade
him
get
out
of
his
trough
and
that
he
did
as
naked
as
god
made
him
then
i
cut
a
piece
of
my
torch
off
for
him
to
light
me
the
which
he
did
obediently
and
brought
me
to
a
little
room
wherein
i
found
the
master
of
the
house
who
together
with
his
people
was
looking
on
at
this
merry
sight
and
begged
with
trembling
for
mercy
and
that
he
easily
came
by
for
in
any
case
we
might
not
harm
the
burghers
and
besides
he
handed
me
over
the
baggage
of
the
hessian
captain
among
which
was
a
fairly
locked
portmanteau
telling
me
the
said
captain
and
all
his
people
save
one
servant
and
the
negro
now
present
were
gone
to
their
posts
to
defend
themselves
meanwhile
had
made
prize
of
the
said
servant
and
six
fine
in
the
stable
these
we
brought
into
the
house
barred
the
doors
and
bade
the
negro
to
put
on
his
clothes
and
told
the
burgher
what
story
he
should
tell
to
his
captain
but
when
the
gate
was
opened
and
the
posts
occupied
and
our
general
of
ordnance
count
von
der
wahl
was
admitted
he
lodged
his
staff
in
the
very
house
where
we
were
so
in
dark
night
we
must
needs
seek
other
quarters
and
these
we
found
with
our
comrades
who
had
come
in
with
the
with
them
we
made
merry
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
in
eating
and
drinking
when
and
i
had
divided
our
booty
for
my
share
i
received
the
negro
and
the
two
best
horses
of
which
one
was
a
spanish
one
on
which
any
soldier
might
meet
his
enemy
and
with
this
thereafter
i
made
no
small
show
but
out
of
the
portmanteau
i
got
divers
costly
rings
and
in
a
golden
case
set
with
rubies
the
prince
of
orange
portrait
for
all
the
rest
i
left
to
so
that
the
whole
if
i
had
desired
to
give
it
away
would
with
the
horses
have
stood
me
in
ducats
since
for
the
negro
that
was
the
poorest
part
of
my
booty
the
of
ordnance
to
whom
i
presented
him
gave
me
two
dozen
thalers
thence
we
marched
quickly
to
the
ems
yet
accomplished
but
little
and
as
it
happened
that
we
came
near
recklinghausen
i
took
leave
together
with
to
speak
with
my
pastor
from
whom
i
had
stolen
the
bacon
with
him
i
made
merry
and
told
him
the
negro
had
made
me
feel
the
same
terror
which
he
and
his
cook
had
felt
and
presented
him
moreover
with
a
fine
striking
watch
for
a
friendly
remembrance
which
i
had
had
out
of
the
captain
portmanteau
and
so
did
i
take
care
to
make
friends
in
all
places
of
them
that
would
otherwise
have
had
cause
to
hate
me
of
an
unequal
combat
in
which
the
weakest
wins
the
day
and
the
conqueror
is
captured
but
with
my
good
fortune
my
pride
so
increased
that
in
the
end
it
could
bring
me
nothing
but
a
fall
for
as
we
were
encamped
some
from
rehnen
i
had
leave
to
go
into
the
town
with
my
dear
comrade
there
to
have
those
arms
furbished
up
which
we
had
just
received
and
as
it
was
our
intent
to
be
right
merry
with
each
other
we
turned
in
to
the
best
inn
and
had
minstrels
sent
for
to
play
our
wine
and
beer
down
our
throat
so
we
fell
to
drinking
and
roaring
and
no
sport
was
wanting
which
could
make
the
money
fly
nay
i
invited
also
lads
from
other
regiments
to
be
my
guests
and
so
carried
myself
as
a
young
prince
who
has
command
of
land
and
folk
and
great
sums
to
spend
by
the
year
and
thus
we
fared
better
than
was
pleasing
to
a
company
of
troopers
who
sat
there
also
at
table
but
with
no
such
mad
tricks
as
we
so
being
angry
they
began
to
jest
upon
us
how
comes
it
said
they
to
one
another
that
these
for
they
took
us
for
musqueteers
seeing
that
no
animal
in
the
world
is
more
like
a
musqueteer
than
is
a
dragoon
and
if
a
dragoon
fall
from
his
horse
he
rises
up
a
musqueteer
can
make
such
a
show
with
their
halfpence
yonder
lad
answered
another
is
surely
some
whose
mother
hath
sent
him
the
and
those
he
now
spends
upon
his
comrades
that
some
time
they
may
pull
him
out
of
the
mud
or
through
a
ditch
with
which
words
they
aimed
at
me
for
they
took
me
for
a
young
nobleman
of
such
talk
the
maid
that
waited
brought
me
private
news
yet
since
i
heard
it
not
myself
i
could
do
no
more
than
fill
a
great
with
wine
and
let
it
go
round
to
the
health
of
all
good
musqueteers
and
at
every
round
made
such
a
hubbub
that
none
could
hear
himself
speak
and
this
vexed
them
yet
more
so
that
they
said
aloud
what
in
the
devil
name
have
these
for
an
easy
life
of
it
whereupon
answered
and
what
matters
that
to
the
bootblacks
this
passed
well
enough
for
he
looked
so
big
and
held
so
fierce
and
threatening
a
carriage
that
no
one
cared
to
give
him
the
rub
yet
he
must
again
fall
foul
of
them
and
this
time
of
a
fellow
of
some
consideration
who
answered
ay
and
if
these
loiterers
could
not
so
swagger
here
on
their
own
for
he
thought
we
lay
there
in
garrison
because
our
clothes
seemed
not
so
as
those
of
the
poor
musqueteers
who
must
lie
day
and
night
in
open
field
where
could
they
show
themselves
who
knows
not
that
any
of
them
in
the
battlefield
is
as
surely
the
booty
of
the
troopers
as
is
the
pigeon
of
the
hawk
but
i
answered
him
it
is
our
business
to
take
cities
and
fortresses
whereas
ye
troopers
if
ye
come
but
to
the
poorest
of
a
town
can
there
drive
no
dog
out
of
his
den
why
may
we
not
then
have
your
good
leave
to
make
merry
in
that
which
is
more
ours
than
yours
the
trooper
answered
him
who
is
master
in
the
field
the
fortresses
must
follow
after
and
that
we
troopers
are
masters
in
the
field
is
proved
by
this
that
i
for
myself
not
only
fear
not
three
such
babes
as
thee
musquet
and
all
but
could
stick
a
couple
such
in
my
and
then
ask
the
third
where
there
were
more
to
be
found
and
if
i
now
sat
by
thee
said
he
with
scorn
i
would
bestow
on
my
young
squire
a
couple
of
buffets
to
prove
the
truth
of
this
yea
said
i
and
though
i
have
as
good
a
pair
of
pistols
as
thou
notwithstanding
i
am
no
trooper
but
only
a
bastard
between
such
and
the
musqueteers
yet
look
you
even
a
child
hath
heart
enough
to
shew
himself
alone
in
open
field
against
such
a
bully
on
horseback
as
thou
art
and
against
all
thine
armoury
aha
thou
swaggerer
said
the
fellow
i
hold
thee
for
a
rascal
if
thou
make
not
good
thy
words
forthwith
as
becomes
an
honourable
nobleman
so
i
threw
him
my
glove
and
see
then
said
i
if
i
get
this
not
from
thee
in
fair
field
with
my
musquet
only
and
on
foot
so
hast
thou
right
and
good
leave
to
hold
and
to
reproach
me
for
such
a
one
as
thy
presumption
has
even
now
named
me
then
we
paid
the
reckoning
and
the
trooper
made
ready
his
carbine
and
pistols
and
i
my
musquet
and
as
he
rode
away
with
his
comrades
to
the
place
agreed
upon
he
told
my
comrade
he
might
order
my
grave
so
he
answered
him
he
had
better
give
it
in
charge
to
one
of
his
own
fellows
that
he
might
order
such
for
him
yet
thereafter
he
rebuked
me
for
my
presumption
and
said
plainly
he
feared
i
should
now
play
my
last
tune
but
i
did
but
laugh
for
i
had
long
since
devised
a
plan
how
to
encounter
the
best
mounted
of
troopers
if
ever
such
an
one
should
attack
me
in
the
open
field
though
armed
only
with
my
musquet
and
on
foot
so
when
we
came
to
the
place
where
this
beggar
dance
should
be
i
had
my
musquet
already
loaded
with
two
balls
and
put
in
fresh
priming
and
smeared
the
cover
of
the
pan
with
tallow
as
careful
musqueteers
be
wont
to
do
to
guard
the
and
powder
in
the
pan
from
damp
in
rainy
weather
before
we
engaged
our
comrades
on
both
sides
agreed
that
we
should
fight
in
open
field
and
to
that
end
that
we
should
start
one
from
the
east
the
other
from
the
west
in
a
fenced
plot
and
thereafter
each
should
do
his
best
against
the
other
as
a
soldier
would
do
in
face
of
the
enemy
and
that
no
one
should
help
either
party
before
or
during
or
after
the
fight
either
to
succour
his
comrade
or
to
avenge
his
death
or
hurt
so
when
they
had
thus
engaged
themselves
with
word
and
hand
i
and
my
opposite
gave
each
other
our
hand
upon
this
that
each
would
forgive
the
other
his
death
in
all
which
most
unreasonable
folly
that
ever
a
man
of
sense
could
entertain
each
hoped
to
gain
for
his
arm
of
the
service
the
advantage
for
all
the
world
as
if
the
entire
honour
and
reputation
of
one
or
the
other
depended
upon
the
outcome
of
our
devilish
undertaking
now
as
i
entered
the
stricken
field
at
my
appointed
end
with
my
match
alight
at
both
ends
and
saw
my
adversary
before
my
eyes
i
made
as
if
i
shook
out
the
old
priming
as
i
walked
yet
i
did
not
so
but
spread
priming
powder
only
on
the
cover
of
the
pan
blew
up
my
match
and
passed
my
two
fingers
over
the
pan
as
is
the
custom
and
before
i
could
see
the
white
of
the
eyes
of
my
opposite
who
kept
me
well
in
sight
i
took
aim
and
set
fire
to
the
false
priming
powder
on
the
cover
of
the
pan
then
the
enemy
believing
that
my
musquet
had
missed
fire
and
that
the
was
stopped
rode
straight
down
upon
me
pistol
in
hand
and
all
too
anxious
to
pay
me
there
and
then
for
my
presumption
but
before
he
was
aware
i
had
the
pan
open
and
shut
again
and
gave
him
such
a
welcome
that
ball
and
fall
came
together
then
i
returned
to
my
fellows
who
received
me
with
embraces
but
his
comrades
freeing
his
foot
from
the
stirrup
dealt
with
him
and
with
us
as
honest
fellows
for
they
returned
me
my
glove
with
all
praise
but
even
when
i
deemed
my
reputation
to
be
at
its
height
came
musqueteers
from
rehnen
who
laid
me
and
my
comrades
by
the
heels
then
presently
i
was
clapped
in
chains
and
sent
to
headquarters
for
all
duels
were
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
how
the
of
ordnance
granted
the
huntsman
his
life
and
held
out
hopes
to
him
of
great
things
now
as
our
general
of
ordnance
was
wont
to
keep
strict
discipline
i
looked
to
lose
my
head
yet
had
i
hopes
to
escape
because
i
had
at
so
early
an
age
ever
carried
myself
well
against
the
enemy
and
gained
great
name
and
fame
for
courage
yet
was
this
hope
uncertain
because
by
reason
of
such
things
happening
daily
was
necessary
to
make
an
example
our
men
had
but
just
beat
up
a
dangerous
nest
of
rats
and
demanded
a
surrender
yet
had
received
a
denial
for
the
enemy
knew
we
had
no
heavy
artillery
for
that
reason
count
von
der
wahl
appeared
with
all
our
force
before
the
said
place
demanded
a
surrender
once
more
by
a
trumpeter
and
threatened
to
storm
the
town
yet
all
he
got
thereby
was
the
writing
that
here
followeth
high
and
count
from
your
excellency
letter
to
me
i
understand
what
you
suggest
to
me
in
the
name
of
his
imperial
roman
majesty
now
your
excellency
with
his
great
understanding
must
be
well
aware
how
improper
nay
unjustifiable
it
were
for
a
soldier
to
surrender
a
place
like
this
to
the
adversary
without
especial
necessity
for
which
reason
your
excellency
will
not
i
hope
blame
me
if
i
wait
till
his
means
of
attack
are
sufficient
but
if
your
excellency
have
occasion
to
employ
my
small
powers
in
any
services
but
those
touching
my
allegiance
i
shall
ever
be
your
excellency
most
obedient
servant
thereupon
was
much
discussion
in
our
camp
about
this
place
for
to
leave
it
alone
was
not
to
be
thought
on
to
storm
it
without
a
breach
would
have
cost
much
blood
and
have
been
uncertain
even
then
whether
we
should
succeed
or
not
and
if
we
had
to
fetch
our
heavy
pieces
and
all
their
equipment
from
münster
and
ham
cost
much
time
trouble
and
expense
so
while
great
and
small
were
hard
at
work
it
came
into
my
head
that
i
should
use
this
opportunity
to
get
free
so
i
set
all
my
wits
to
work
and
reflected
how
one
might
cheat
the
enemy
seeing
was
only
the
cannon
that
were
wanted
and
pretty
soon
i
had
devised
a
trick
and
let
my
know
i
had
plans
by
which
the
place
could
be
secured
without
trouble
and
expense
if
only
i
could
be
pardoned
and
set
free
yet
some
old
and
tried
soldiers
laughed
and
said
drowning
men
catch
at
straws
and
this
good
fellow
thinks
to
talk
himself
out
of
gaol
but
the
himself
with
others
that
knew
me
listened
to
my
words
as
to
an
article
of
belief
wherefore
he
went
himself
to
the
of
the
ordnance
and
laid
before
him
my
plan
with
the
recital
moreover
of
many
things
that
he
could
tell
of
me
and
inasmuch
as
the
count
had
already
heard
of
the
huntsman
he
had
me
brought
before
him
and
for
so
long
loosed
from
my
bonds
he
was
set
at
table
when
i
came
and
my
told
him
how
the
spring
before
having
stood
my
first
hour
as
sentry
under
james
gate
at
soest
a
heavy
rain
with
thunder
and
wind
had
suddenly
come
on
and
when
each
running
from
the
fields
and
the
gardens
into
the
town
there
was
great
press
of
foot
and
horse
i
had
had
the
wit
to
call
out
the
guard
because
in
such
a
tumult
a
town
was
easiest
to
take
at
last
said
the
further
came
an
old
woman
dripping
wet
and
said
even
as
she
passed
by
the
huntsman
i
have
felt
this
storm
in
my
back
for
a
fortnight
so
the
huntsman
hearing
this
and
having
a
rod
in
his
hand
smote
her
with
it
over
the
shoulder
and
says
he
old
witch
couldst
thou
not
let
it
loose
before
must
thou
wait
till
i
stood
sentry
and
when
his
officer
rebuked
him
he
answered
is
rightly
served
the
old
carrion
crow
had
heard
a
month
ago
how
all
were
crying
out
for
rain
why
did
she
not
let
honest
folk
have
it
before
it
had
been
better
for
the
barley
and
hops
at
this
the
general
though
he
was
in
general
a
stern
man
laughed
heartily
but
i
thought
if
the
colonel
tell
him
of
such
tricks
surely
he
will
not
have
failed
to
speak
of
my
other
devices
so
i
was
brought
in
and
when
the
general
asked
what
was
my
plan
i
answered
gracious
sir
although
my
fault
and
your
excellency
order
and
prohibition
do
both
deny
me
my
life
yet
my
most
humble
loyalty
which
is
due
from
me
towards
his
imperial
majesty
my
most
gracious
lord
even
to
the
death
bids
me
so
far
as
lies
in
my
weak
power
yet
do
the
enemy
a
damage
and
further
the
interests
and
arms
of
his
majesty
so
the
general
cut
me
short
and
says
he
didst
thou
not
lately
give
me
the
negro
yea
gracious
sir
said
i
then
said
he
well
thy
zeal
and
loyalty
might
perhaps
serve
to
spare
thy
life
but
what
plan
hast
thou
to
bring
the
enemy
out
of
this
place
without
great
loss
in
time
and
men
so
i
answered
since
the
town
can
not
resist
heavy
artillery
my
humble
opinion
is
that
the
enemy
would
soon
come
to
terms
if
he
did
but
really
believe
we
had
such
pieces
that
said
the
general
a
fool
could
have
told
me
but
who
will
persuade
them
so
to
believe
then
i
answered
thine
own
eyes
i
have
examined
their
mainguard
with
a
and
it
can
be
easily
deceived
if
we
did
but
set
a
few
baulks
of
timber
shaped
like
on
waggons
and
haul
them
into
the
field
with
many
horses
they
will
certainly
believe
they
are
heavy
pieces
specially
if
your
excellency
will
order
works
to
be
thrown
up
about
the
field
as
if
to
plant
cannon
there
my
dear
little
friend
answered
the
count
they
be
not
children
in
the
town
they
will
not
believe
this
pantomime
but
will
require
to
hear
thy
guns
and
if
the
trick
fail
says
he
to
the
officers
that
stood
around
we
shall
be
mocked
of
all
the
world
but
i
answered
gracious
sir
an
i
can
but
have
a
pair
of
double
musquets
and
a
pretty
large
cask
i
will
make
them
to
hear
great
guns
only
beyond
the
sound
there
can
be
no
further
effect
but
if
against
all
expectation
naught
but
mockery
ensue
then
shall
i
the
inventor
that
must
in
any
case
die
take
with
me
that
mockery
and
purge
it
away
with
my
life
yet
the
general
liked
it
not
but
my
colonel
persuaded
him
to
it
for
he
said
i
was
in
such
cases
so
lucky
that
he
doubted
not
this
trick
would
succeed
so
the
count
ordered
him
to
settle
the
matter
as
he
thought
it
could
best
be
done
and
said
to
him
in
jest
that
the
honour
he
should
gain
thereby
should
be
reckoned
to
him
alone
so
three
such
baulks
were
brought
to
hand
and
before
each
were
harnessed
horses
though
two
had
been
sufficient
and
these
towards
evening
we
brought
up
in
full
sight
of
the
foe
and
meanwhile
i
had
gotten
me
three
double
musquets
and
a
great
cask
from
a
mansion
near
at
hand
and
set
all
in
order
as
i
would
have
it
and
by
night
this
was
added
to
our
fool
artillery
the
double
musquets
i
charged
twice
over
and
had
them
discharged
through
the
said
cask
of
which
the
bottom
had
been
knocked
out
as
if
it
was
three
trial
shots
being
fired
which
sounded
so
thunderously
that
any
man
had
sworn
they
were
great
serpents
or
our
general
must
needs
laugh
at
such
trickery
and
again
offered
the
enemy
terms
with
the
addition
that
if
they
did
not
agree
that
same
evening
it
would
not
go
so
easily
with
them
the
next
day
thereupon
hostages
were
exchanged
and
terms
arranged
and
the
same
night
one
gate
of
the
town
put
into
our
hands
and
this
was
well
indeed
for
me
for
the
count
not
only
granted
me
my
life
that
by
his
order
i
had
forfeited
but
set
me
free
the
same
night
and
commanded
the
in
my
presence
to
appoint
me
to
the
first
ensigncy
that
should
fall
vacant
which
was
not
to
his
taste
for
he
had
cousins
and
kinsmen
many
in
waiting
that
i
should
be
promoted
before
them
contains
all
manner
of
matters
of
little
import
and
great
imagination
on
this
expedition
nothing
more
of
note
happened
to
me
but
when
i
came
again
to
soest
i
found
the
hessians
from
lippstadt
had
captured
my
servant
that
i
had
left
to
guard
my
baggage
together
with
one
horse
that
was
at
pasture
from
my
servant
the
enemy
learned
of
my
ways
and
works
and
therefore
held
me
higher
than
before
as
having
been
persuaded
by
common
report
i
was
but
a
sorcerer
he
told
them
moreover
he
had
been
one
of
the
devils
that
had
so
dismayed
the
huntsman
of
wesel
in
the
which
when
the
said
huntsman
heard
of
he
was
so
shamed
that
he
took
to
his
heels
again
and
fled
from
lippstadt
to
the
hollanders
but
it
was
my
greatest
good
fortune
that
this
servant
of
mine
was
taken
as
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
now
i
began
to
behave
myself
somewhat
more
reputably
than
before
as
having
such
fine
hopes
of
presently
being
made
ensign
so
by
degrees
i
joined
company
with
officers
and
young
noblemen
that
were
eager
for
that
office
which
i
imagined
i
should
soon
get
for
this
reason
these
were
my
worst
enemies
and
yet
gave
themselves
out
to
be
my
best
friends
even
the
was
no
longer
so
good
to
me
for
he
had
orders
to
promote
me
before
his
own
kindred
my
captain
was
my
enemy
because
i
made
a
better
show
in
horses
clothing
and
arms
than
he
and
no
longer
spent
so
much
on
the
old
miser
as
before
he
had
rather
have
seen
my
head
hewn
off
than
an
ensigncy
promised
me
for
he
had
thought
to
inherit
my
fine
horses
in
like
manner
my
lieutenant
hated
me
for
a
single
word
that
i
had
lately
without
thought
let
slip
which
came
about
thus
we
two
were
on
the
last
expedition
ordered
to
a
lonely
post
as
vedettes
and
as
the
turn
to
watch
fell
to
me
which
must
be
done
lying
down
besides
that
it
was
a
night
the
lieutenant
comes
to
me
creeping
on
his
belly
like
a
snake
and
says
he
sentry
dost
thou
mark
aught
so
i
answered
yea
herr
lieutenant
and
what
what
says
he
i
answered
i
mark
that
your
honour
is
afeared
and
from
thenceforward
i
had
no
more
favour
with
him
wherever
the
danger
was
greatest
thither
was
i
sent
first
of
all
yea
he
sought
in
all
places
and
at
all
times
to
dust
my
jacket
before
i
became
ensign
and
so
could
not
defend
myself
nor
were
the
sergeants
less
my
enemies
because
i
was
preferred
to
them
all
and
as
to
the
privates
they
too
began
to
fail
in
their
love
and
friendship
to
me
because
it
seemed
i
despised
them
inasmuch
as
i
no
longer
consorted
specially
with
them
but
as
aforesaid
with
greater
jacks
which
loved
me
none
the
more
but
the
worst
was
that
no
man
told
me
how
each
was
minded
towards
me
and
so
i
could
not
perceive
it
for
many
a
one
talked
with
me
in
friendliest
wise
that
had
sooner
seen
me
dead
so
i
lived
like
a
blind
man
in
all
security
and
became
ever
haughtier
and
though
i
knew
it
vexed
this
one
and
that
if
i
made
a
greater
show
than
noblemen
and
officers
of
rank
yet
i
held
not
back
i
feared
not
to
wear
a
collar
of
sixty
hose
and
white
satin
sleeves
trimmed
all
over
with
gold
which
was
at
that
time
the
dress
of
the
highest
officers
and
therefore
an
eyesore
to
all
yet
was
i
a
terrible
young
fool
so
to
play
the
lord
for
had
i
dealt
otherwise
and
bestowed
the
money
i
so
uselessly
did
hang
upon
my
body
in
proper
ways
i
should
have
soon
gained
my
ensigncy
and
also
not
have
made
so
many
enemies
yet
i
stopped
not
here
but
decked
out
my
best
horse
which
had
gotten
from
the
hessian
captain
with
saddle
bridle
and
arms
in
such
fashion
that
when
i
was
mounted
one
might
well
have
taken
me
for
another
george
and
nothing
grieved
me
more
than
to
know
i
was
no
nobleman
and
so
could
not
clothe
my
servant
and
my
in
my
livery
yet
i
thought
all
things
have
their
beginning
if
thou
hast
a
then
canst
thou
have
thine
own
livery
and
when
thou
art
an
ensign
thou
must
have
a
though
thou
art
no
nobleman
i
was
not
long
pregnant
with
these
thoughts
but
had
a
devised
for
me
by
a
herald
which
was
three
red
masks
in
a
white
field
and
for
a
crest
a
bust
of
a
young
jester
in
a
calfskin
with
a
pair
of
hare
ears
adorned
with
little
balls
in
front
for
i
thought
this
suited
best
with
my
name
being
called
simplicissimus
and
so
would
i
have
the
fool
to
remind
me
in
my
future
high
estate
what
manner
of
fellow
i
had
been
in
hanau
lest
i
should
become
too
proud
for
already
i
thought
no
small
things
of
myself
and
so
was
i
properly
the
first
of
my
name
and
race
and
escutcheon
and
if
any
had
jeered
at
me
thereupon
i
had
without
doubt
presented
him
a
sword
or
a
pair
of
pistols
and
though
i
had
yet
no
thoughts
of
womenkind
yet
all
the
same
i
went
with
the
young
nobles
when
they
visited
young
ladies
of
whom
there
were
many
in
the
town
to
let
myself
be
seen
and
to
make
a
show
with
my
fine
hair
clothes
and
plumes
i
must
confess
that
for
the
sake
of
my
figure
i
was
preferred
before
all
yet
must
i
all
the
same
hear
how
the
spoilt
baggages
compared
me
with
a
fair
and
statue
in
which
beside
its
beauty
was
neither
strength
nor
sap
for
that
was
all
they
desired
in
me
and
except
the
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
or
perform
to
please
them
for
of
love
as
yet
i
knew
nothing
but
when
they
that
knew
how
to
pay
their
court
would
gibe
at
me
for
my
wooden
behaviour
and
awkwardness
to
make
themselves
more
beloved
and
to
show
off
their
ready
speech
then
would
i
answer
was
enough
for
me
if
i
could
still
find
my
pleasure
in
a
bright
sword
or
a
good
musquet
and
the
ladies
held
me
right
and
this
angered
the
gentlemen
so
that
they
secretly
swore
to
have
my
life
though
there
was
none
that
had
heart
enough
to
challenge
me
or
give
me
cause
enough
to
challenge
one
of
them
for
which
a
couple
of
buffets
or
any
insulting
word
had
been
sufficient
and
i
gave
every
chance
for
this
by
my
loose
talk
from
which
the
ladies
argued
i
must
be
a
lad
of
mettle
and
said
openly
my
figure
and
my
noble
heart
could
plead
better
with
any
lady
than
all
the
compliments
that
cupid
ever
devised
and
that
made
the
rest
angrier
than
ever
how
fortune
unexpectedly
bestowed
on
the
huntsman
a
noble
present
had
two
fine
horses
that
were
at
that
time
all
the
joy
i
had
in
the
world
every
day
i
rode
them
in
the
or
else
for
amusement
if
i
had
naught
else
to
do
not
indeed
that
the
horses
had
anything
to
learn
but
i
did
it
that
people
might
see
that
the
fine
creatures
belonged
to
me
and
when
i
went
pranking
down
a
street
or
rather
the
horse
prancing
under
me
and
the
stupid
multitude
looking
on
and
saying
look
is
the
huntsman
see
what
a
fine
horse
ah
what
a
handsome
plume
or
zounds
what
a
fine
fellow
is
this
i
pricked
up
mine
ears
and
was
as
pleased
as
if
the
queen
of
sheba
had
likened
me
to
solomon
in
all
his
glory
yet
fool
that
i
was
i
heard
not
what
perhaps
at
that
time
wise
folk
thought
of
me
or
mine
enviers
said
of
me
these
last
doubtless
wished
i
might
break
my
neck
since
they
could
not
do
it
for
me
and
others
assuredly
thought
that
if
all
men
had
their
own
i
could
not
practise
such
foolish
swaggering
in
a
word
the
wisest
must
have
held
me
without
doubt
for
a
young
colin
clout
whose
pride
would
certainly
not
last
long
because
it
stood
upon
a
bad
foundation
and
must
be
supported
only
by
uncertain
plunder
and
if
i
must
confess
the
truth
i
must
grant
that
these
last
judged
not
amiss
though
then
i
understood
it
not
for
was
this
and
only
this
with
me
that
i
would
have
made
his
shirt
warm
for
any
man
or
adversary
that
had
to
deal
with
me
so
that
i
might
well
have
passed
for
a
simple
good
soldier
though
i
was
but
a
child
but
was
this
cause
made
me
so
great
a
man
that
nowadays
the
veriest
can
shoot
the
greatest
hero
in
the
world
and
had
not
gunpowder
been
invented
i
must
have
put
my
pride
in
my
pocket
now
was
my
custom
in
these
rides
to
examine
all
ways
and
paths
all
ditches
marshes
thickets
hills
and
streams
make
myself
acquainted
with
them
and
fix
them
in
my
memory
so
that
if
one
ever
had
occasion
to
skirmish
with
the
enemy
i
might
employ
the
advantage
of
the
place
both
for
defence
and
offence
to
this
end
i
rode
once
not
far
from
the
town
by
an
old
ruin
where
formerly
a
house
had
stood
at
the
first
sight
i
thought
this
were
a
fit
place
to
lay
an
ambush
or
to
retreat
to
specially
for
us
dragoons
if
we
should
be
outnumbered
and
chased
by
cavalry
so
i
rode
into
the
courtyard
whose
walls
were
pretty
well
ruined
to
see
if
at
a
pinch
one
could
take
refuge
there
on
horseback
and
how
one
could
defend
it
on
foot
but
when
to
this
end
i
would
view
all
exactly
and
sought
to
ride
by
the
cellar
the
walls
of
which
were
still
standing
i
could
neither
with
kindness
nor
force
bring
my
horse
which
commonly
feared
nought
to
go
where
i
would
i
spurred
him
till
i
was
vexed
but
it
availed
not
so
i
dismounted
and
led
him
by
the
bridle
down
the
ruined
steps
which
he
had
shied
at
so
that
i
should
know
how
to
act
another
time
but
he
backed
as
much
as
he
could
yet
at
length
with
gentle
words
and
strokings
i
had
him
down
and
while
i
patted
and
caressed
him
i
found
that
he
was
sweating
with
fear
and
ever
staring
into
one
corner
of
the
cellar
into
which
he
would
by
no
means
go
and
in
which
i
could
see
naught
at
which
the
most
skittish
beast
could
shy
but
as
i
stood
there
full
of
wonder
and
looked
upon
my
horse
all
with
fear
there
came
on
me
also
such
a
terror
that
even
as
if
i
was
dragged
upwards
by
the
hair
and
a
bucket
of
cold
water
poured
down
my
back
yet
could
i
see
nothing
but
the
horse
acted
more
and
more
strangely
till
i
could
fancy
nothing
else
but
that
i
was
perhaps
bewitched
horse
and
all
and
should
come
by
my
end
in
that
same
cellar
so
i
would
fain
go
back
but
the
horse
would
not
follow
and
thereat
i
grew
more
dismayed
and
so
confused
that
in
truth
i
knew
not
what
i
did
at
last
i
took
a
pistol
in
my
hand
and
tied
the
horse
to
a
strong
that
grew
in
the
cellar
intending
to
go
forth
and
find
people
near
by
that
could
help
to
fetch
the
horse
out
but
as
i
was
about
this
it
came
into
my
head
that
perchance
some
treasure
lay
hid
in
this
old
ruin
which
was
therefore
haunted
to
this
conceit
i
gave
heed
and
looked
round
more
exactly
and
just
in
the
place
to
which
my
horse
refused
to
go
i
was
ware
of
a
part
of
the
wall
unlike
the
rest
both
in
colour
and
masonry
and
about
the
bigness
of
a
common
but
when
i
would
approach
was
with
me
as
before
namely
that
my
hair
stood
on
end
and
this
strengthened
my
belief
that
a
treasure
must
there
be
hid
ten
times
nay
a
hundred
times
sooner
would
i
have
exchanged
shots
with
an
enemy
than
have
found
myself
in
such
a
terror
i
was
plagued
and
knew
not
by
what
for
i
heard
and
saw
naught
so
i
took
the
other
pistol
from
the
holster
as
meaning
with
it
to
go
off
and
leave
the
horse
yet
could
i
not
again
mount
the
steps
for
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
strong
draught
of
wind
kept
me
back
and
now
i
felt
my
flesh
creep
indeed
at
last
it
came
into
my
mind
to
fire
the
pistols
that
the
peasants
that
worked
in
the
fields
close
by
might
run
to
the
spot
and
help
me
with
word
and
deed
and
this
i
did
because
i
neither
knew
nor
could
think
of
any
other
means
to
escape
from
this
evil
place
of
wonders
and
i
was
so
enraged
or
rather
so
desperate
for
i
knew
not
myself
how
was
with
me
that
as
i
fired
i
aimed
my
pistols
at
the
very
place
wherein
i
believed
the
cause
of
my
plight
lay
and
with
both
balls
i
hit
the
piece
of
the
wall
so
hard
that
they
made
a
hole
wherein
a
man
could
set
both
his
fists
now
no
sooner
had
i
fired
than
my
horse
neighed
and
pricked
up
his
ears
which
heartily
rejoiced
me
i
knew
not
whether
was
because
the
goblin
or
spectre
had
vanished
or
because
the
poor
beast
was
roused
by
the
noise
of
but
is
certain
i
plucked
up
heart
again
and
went
without
hindrance
or
fear
to
the
hole
which
i
had
just
opened
by
the
shot
and
there
i
began
to
break
down
the
wall
completely
and
found
of
silver
gold
and
jewels
so
rich
a
treasure
as
would
have
kept
me
in
comfort
to
this
day
if
i
had
but
known
how
to
keep
it
and
dispose
of
it
well
there
were
six
dozen
old
french
silver
a
great
gold
cup
some
double
tankards
four
silver
and
one
golden
one
old
french
golden
chain
and
divers
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
and
sapphires
set
in
rings
and
in
other
jewellery
also
a
whole
casquet
full
of
pearls
but
all
spoiled
or
discoloured
and
then
in
a
mouldy
leather
bag
eighty
of
the
oldest
joachim
dollars
of
fine
silver
likewise
gold
pieces
with
the
french
arms
and
an
eagle
a
coin
which
none
could
recognise
because
as
folks
said
no
one
could
read
the
inscription
this
money
with
the
rings
and
jewels
i
strapped
into
my
my
boots
and
my
holsters
and
because
i
had
no
bag
with
me
since
i
had
but
ridden
forth
for
pleasure
i
cut
the
housing
from
my
saddle
and
into
it
i
packed
the
silver
vessels
for
was
lined
and
would
serve
me
well
as
a
sack
hung
the
golden
chain
round
my
neck
mounted
my
horse
joyfully
and
rode
towards
my
quarters
but
as
i
came
out
of
the
courtyard
i
was
aware
of
two
peasants
that
would
have
run
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
yet
having
six
feet
and
level
country
i
easily
overtook
them
and
asked
why
they
would
have
fled
and
were
so
terribly
afeared
so
they
said
they
had
thought
i
was
the
ghost
that
dwelt
in
that
deserted
court
and
if
any
came
too
near
to
him
was
wont
to
mishandle
them
miserably
then
as
i
asked
further
of
his
ways
they
told
me
that
for
fear
of
this
monster
was
often
many
years
that
no
one
came
near
that
place
save
some
stranger
that
had
lost
his
way
and
came
thither
by
chance
the
story
went
they
said
that
an
iron
trough
full
of
money
lay
within
guarded
by
a
black
dog
and
also
a
maiden
that
had
a
curse
upon
her
and
to
follow
the
old
story
they
had
themselves
heard
from
their
grandsires
there
should
come
into
the
land
a
stranger
nobleman
that
knew
neither
his
father
nor
mother
and
should
rescue
the
maiden
and
open
the
trough
with
a
key
of
fire
and
carry
off
the
hidden
gold
and
of
such
foolish
fables
they
told
me
many
more
but
because
they
are
but
ill
to
hear
i
here
cut
them
short
for
briefness
thereafter
i
did
ask
them
what
they
too
had
been
about
since
at
other
times
they
dared
not
go
into
the
ruin
they
answered
they
had
heard
a
shot
and
a
loud
cry
and
had
run
up
to
see
what
was
to
do
but
when
i
told
them
was
i
that
shot
in
the
hope
that
people
would
come
into
the
ruin
because
i
too
was
pretty
much
afeared
but
knew
nought
of
any
cry
they
answered
there
might
be
shots
enough
heard
in
that
castle
before
any
of
our
neighbourhood
would
come
thither
for
in
truth
is
so
ghostly
beset
that
we
had
not
believed
my
lord
if
he
had
said
he
had
been
therein
an
we
had
not
ourselves
seen
him
ride
out
thence
so
then
they
would
know
many
things
of
me
especially
what
manner
of
place
it
was
within
and
whether
i
had
not
seen
the
damsel
and
the
black
dog
sitting
on
the
iron
trough
so
that
if
i
had
desired
to
brag
i
could
have
put
strange
fancies
into
their
heads
but
i
said
not
the
least
word
not
even
that
i
had
gotten
the
costly
treasure
but
rode
away
to
my
quarters
and
looked
upon
my
find
which
mightily
delighted
me
of
simplicissimus
strange
fancies
and
castles
in
the
air
and
how
he
guarded
his
treasure
now
they
that
know
the
worth
of
money
and
therefore
take
it
for
their
god
have
no
little
reason
on
their
side
for
if
there
be
a
man
in
the
world
that
hath
experienced
its
powers
and
wellnigh
divine
virtues
that
man
am
i
for
i
know
how
a
man
fares
that
hath
a
fair
provision
thereof
yet
have
i
never
yet
known
how
he
should
feel
that
had
never
a
farthing
in
his
pouch
yea
i
could
even
take
upon
me
to
prove
that
this
same
money
possesses
all
virtues
and
powers
more
than
any
precious
stones
for
it
can
drive
away
all
melancholia
like
the
diamond
it
causeth
love
and
inclination
to
study
like
the
emerald
for
so
comes
it
that
commonly
students
have
more
money
than
poor
folk
children
it
taketh
away
fear
and
maketh
man
joyful
and
happy
like
unto
the
ruby
often
an
hindrance
to
sleep
like
the
garnet
on
the
other
hand
it
hath
great
power
to
produce
repose
of
mind
and
so
sleep
like
the
jacinth
it
strengtheneth
the
heart
and
maketh
a
man
jolly
and
companionable
lively
and
kind
like
the
sapphire
and
amethyst
it
driveth
away
bad
dreams
giveth
joy
sharpeneth
the
understanding
and
if
one
have
a
plaint
against
another
it
gaineth
him
the
victory
like
the
sardius
and
in
especial
if
the
judge
palm
be
first
well
oiled
therewith
it
quencheth
unchaste
desire
for
by
means
of
gold
one
can
possess
fair
women
and
in
a
word
is
not
to
be
exprest
what
gold
can
do
as
i
have
before
set
forth
in
my
book
intituled
black
and
white
if
any
man
know
how
rightly
to
use
and
employ
this
information
as
to
mine
own
money
that
i
had
then
brought
together
both
with
robbery
and
the
finding
of
this
treasure
it
had
a
special
power
of
its
own
for
first
of
all
it
made
me
prouder
than
i
was
before
so
much
so
that
it
vexed
me
to
the
heart
that
i
must
still
be
called
simplicissimus
only
it
spoiled
my
sleep
like
the
amethyst
for
many
a
night
i
lay
awake
and
did
speculate
how
i
could
put
it
out
to
advantage
and
get
more
to
put
to
it
yea
and
it
made
me
a
most
perfect
reckoner
for
i
must
calculate
what
mine
uncoined
silver
and
gold
might
be
worth
and
adding
this
to
that
which
i
had
borrowed
here
and
there
and
which
yet
was
in
my
purse
i
found
without
the
precious
stones
a
fine
overplus
yet
did
my
money
prove
to
me
its
inborn
roguery
and
evil
inclination
to
temptation
inasmuch
as
it
did
fully
expound
to
me
the
proverb
he
that
hath
much
will
ever
have
more
and
made
me
so
miserly
that
any
man
might
well
have
hated
me
from
my
money
i
got
many
foolish
plans
and
strange
fancies
in
my
brain
and
yet
could
follow
out
no
conceit
of
all
that
i
devised
at
one
time
i
thought
i
would
leave
the
wars
and
betake
myself
somewhither
and
spend
my
days
in
fatness
out
of
the
window
but
quickly
i
did
repent
me
of
that
and
in
especial
because
i
considered
what
a
free
life
i
now
led
and
what
hopes
i
had
to
become
a
great
jack
and
then
my
thought
was
this
up
and
away
simplicissimus
and
get
thyself
made
a
nobleman
and
raise
thine
own
company
of
dragoons
for
the
emperor
at
thine
own
cost
and
presently
thou
art
a
perfected
young
lord
that
with
the
times
can
rise
yet
higher
yet
as
soon
as
i
reflected
that
this
my
greatness
could
be
made
small
by
any
unlucky
engagement
or
be
ended
by
a
peace
that
should
bring
the
war
soon
to
a
finish
i
could
not
find
this
plan
to
my
taste
so
then
i
began
to
wish
i
had
my
full
age
as
a
man
for
hadst
thou
that
said
i
to
myself
thou
couldst
take
a
rich
young
wife
and
so
buy
thee
a
nobleman
estate
somewhere
and
lead
a
peaceful
life
there
would
i
betake
myself
to
the
rearing
of
cattle
and
enjoy
my
sufficiency
to
the
full
yet
as
i
knew
i
was
too
young
for
this
i
must
let
that
plan
go
by
the
board
also
such
and
the
like
conceits
had
i
many
till
at
last
i
resolved
to
give
over
my
best
effects
to
some
man
of
substance
in
some
safe
town
to
keep
and
to
wait
how
fortune
would
further
deal
with
me
now
at
that
time
i
had
my
jupiter
still
with
me
for
indeed
i
could
not
be
rid
of
him
and
at
times
the
man
could
talk
most
reasonably
and
for
weeks
together
would
be
sane
and
sober
but
above
all
things
he
held
me
dear
for
my
goodness
to
him
and
seeing
me
in
deep
thought
he
says
to
me
dear
son
give
away
your
gold
silver
and
all
and
why
said
i
dear
jupiter
oh
says
he
to
get
you
friends
and
be
rid
of
your
useless
cares
to
which
i
answered
i
would
fain
have
more
of
such
then
says
he
get
more
but
in
such
fashion
will
ye
never
in
your
life
have
more
friends
nor
more
peace
leave
it
to
old
misers
to
be
greedy
but
do
ye
so
behave
as
becomes
a
fine
young
lad
for
ye
shall
sooner
lack
good
friends
than
good
money
so
i
pondered
on
the
matter
and
found
that
jupiter
reasoned
well
of
the
case
yet
greed
had
such
hold
on
me
that
i
could
not
resolve
to
give
away
aught
yet
i
did
at
last
present
to
the
commandant
a
pair
of
double
tankards
and
to
my
captain
a
couple
of
silver
by
which
i
achieved
nothing
more
than
to
make
their
mouths
water
for
the
rest
for
these
were
rare
pieces
of
antiquity
my
true
comrade
i
rewarded
with
twelve
who
in
return
advised
me
i
should
either
make
away
with
my
riches
or
else
expect
to
fall
into
misfortune
by
their
means
for
said
he
it
liked
the
officers
not
that
a
common
soldier
should
have
more
money
than
they
and
he
himself
had
known
this
that
one
comrade
should
secretly
murder
another
for
the
sake
of
money
till
now
said
he
i
had
been
able
to
keep
secret
what
i
had
gotten
in
booty
for
all
believed
i
had
spent
it
on
clothes
horses
and
arms
but
now
i
could
conceal
nought
nor
make
folks
believe
i
had
no
secret
store
of
money
for
each
one
made
out
the
treasure
i
had
found
to
be
greater
than
it
was
and
yet
i
spent
not
so
much
as
before
nor
could
he
help
but
hear
what
rumours
went
about
among
the
men
and
were
he
in
my
place
he
would
let
wars
be
wars
would
settle
himself
in
safety
somewhere
and
let
our
lord
god
rule
the
world
as
he
will
but
i
answered
harkye
brother
how
can
i
throw
to
the
winds
my
hopes
of
an
ensigncy
yea
yea
says
but
devil
take
me
if
thou
ever
get
thine
ensigncy
the
others
that
wait
for
it
would
help
to
break
thy
neck
a
thousand
times
over
if
they
saw
that
such
a
post
was
vacant
and
thou
to
have
it
teach
me
not
how
to
know
salmon
from
trout
for
my
father
was
a
fisherman
and
be
not
angry
with
me
brother
for
i
have
seen
how
it
fares
in
war
longer
than
thou
seest
thou
not
how
many
a
sergeant
grows
grey
with
his
spontoon
that
deserved
to
have
a
company
before
many
others
thinkest
thou
they
are
not
fellows
that
have
some
right
to
hope
and
indeed
they
have
more
right
to
such
promotion
than
thou
as
thou
thyself
must
confess
nor
could
i
answer
aught
for
did
but
speak
the
truth
from
an
honest
german
heart
and
flattered
me
not
yet
must
i
bite
my
lip
in
secret
for
i
thought
at
that
time
mighty
well
of
myself
yet
i
weighed
this
speech
and
that
of
my
jupiter
full
carefully
and
considered
that
i
had
no
single
friend
that
would
help
me
in
straits
or
would
revenge
my
death
open
or
secret
and
i
myself
could
see
plain
enough
how
it
stood
with
me
yet
neither
my
desire
of
honour
nor
of
money
would
leave
me
and
still
less
my
hope
to
become
great
to
leave
the
wars
and
to
be
in
peace
nay
rather
i
held
to
my
first
plan
and
when
a
chance
offered
for
cologne
whither
i
with
some
hundred
dragoons
was
ordered
to
convoy
certain
carriers
and
waggons
of
merchandise
from
münster
i
packed
up
my
treasure
took
it
with
me
and
gave
it
in
charge
to
one
of
the
first
merchants
of
that
city
to
be
drawn
out
on
production
of
an
exact
list
of
the
things
now
it
was
marks
of
uncoined
silver
fifteen
marks
of
gold
eighty
joachim
dollars
and
in
a
sealed
casquet
divers
rings
and
jewels
which
with
gold
and
precious
stones
weighed
eight
and
a
half
pounds
in
all
together
with
ancient
golden
coins
that
were
worth
each
a
gold
gulden
and
a
half
with
me
i
took
my
jupiter
as
he
desired
it
and
had
kinsfolk
of
repute
in
cologne
to
whom
he
boasted
of
the
good
turns
i
had
done
him
and
caused
me
to
be
received
of
them
with
great
honour
yet
did
he
never
cease
to
counsel
me
that
i
should
bestow
my
money
better
and
buy
myself
friends
that
would
be
of
more
service
to
me
than
money
in
my
purse
how
the
huntsman
was
captured
by
the
enemy
so
on
the
journey
home
i
pondered
much
how
i
should
carry
myself
in
future
so
that
i
might
get
the
favour
of
all
for
had
put
a
troublesome
flea
in
my
ear
and
had
made
me
to
believe
i
was
envied
of
all
and
in
truth
was
no
otherwise
and
now
came
into
my
mind
what
the
famous
prophetess
of
soest
had
once
said
and
so
i
burdened
myself
with
yet
greater
cares
yet
with
these
thoughts
did
i
sharpen
my
wit
and
perceived
that
a
man
that
should
live
without
cares
would
be
dull
as
any
beast
then
i
considered
for
what
reason
one
and
the
other
might
hate
me
and
how
i
might
deal
with
each
to
have
his
goodwill
again
yet
most
of
all
must
i
wonder
how
men
could
be
so
false
and
yet
give
me
nought
but
good
words
whereas
they
loved
me
not
for
that
cause
i
determined
to
deal
as
others
did
and
to
say
what
would
please
each
yea
to
approach
every
man
with
respect
though
i
felt
it
not
for
most
of
all
i
felt
was
mine
own
pride
had
burdened
me
with
the
most
enemies
therefore
i
held
it
needful
to
shew
myself
humble
again
though
i
was
not
and
to
consort
again
with
common
folk
but
to
approach
my
betters
hat
in
hand
and
to
refrain
from
all
finery
in
dress
till
my
rank
should
be
bettered
from
the
merchant
in
cologne
i
had
drawn
dollars
to
repay
the
same
with
interest
when
he
should
return
my
treasure
these
hundred
dollars
i
was
minded
to
spend
on
the
way
for
the
behoof
of
the
escort
as
now
perceiving
that
greed
makes
no
friends
and
therefore
was
resolved
on
this
very
journey
to
alter
my
ways
and
make
a
new
beginning
yet
did
i
reckon
without
mine
host
for
as
we
would
pass
through
the
duchy
of
berg
there
waited
for
us
in
a
post
of
vantage
eighty
musqueteers
and
fifty
troopers
even
when
i
was
ordered
forward
with
four
others
and
a
corporal
to
ride
in
front
and
to
spy
out
the
road
so
the
enemy
kept
quiet
when
we
came
into
the
ambush
and
let
us
pass
lest
if
they
had
attacked
us
the
convoy
should
be
warned
before
they
came
into
the
pass
where
they
were
but
after
us
they
sent
a
cornet
and
eight
troopers
that
kept
us
in
sight
till
their
people
had
attacked
our
escort
itself
and
we
turned
round
to
protect
the
waggons
at
which
they
rode
down
upon
us
and
asked
would
we
have
quarter
now
for
my
part
i
was
well
mounted
for
i
had
my
best
horse
under
me
yet
would
i
not
run
but
rode
up
a
little
hillock
to
see
if
honour
was
to
be
had
by
fighting
yet
i
was
presently
aware
by
the
noise
of
the
volley
that
our
people
received
what
it
was
and
so
disposed
myself
to
flight
but
the
cornet
had
thought
of
all
and
already
cut
off
our
retreat
and
as
i
was
preparing
to
cut
my
way
through
he
once
again
offered
me
quarter
for
he
thought
me
an
officer
so
i
considered
that
to
make
sure
of
one
life
is
better
than
an
uncertain
hazard
and
therefore
asked
would
he
keep
his
promise
of
quarter
as
an
honest
soldier
he
answered
yes
honestly
so
i
presented
him
my
sword
and
rendered
myself
up
a
prisoner
at
once
he
asked
me
of
what
condition
i
was
for
he
took
me
for
a
nobleman
and
therefore
an
officer
but
when
i
answered
him
i
was
called
the
huntsman
of
soest
then
art
thou
lucky
says
he
that
thou
didst
not
fall
into
our
hands
a
month
ago
for
then
could
i
have
given
thee
no
quarter
since
then
thou
wast
commonly
held
among
our
people
for
a
declared
sorcerer
this
cornet
was
a
fine
young
cavalier
and
not
more
than
two
years
older
than
i
and
was
mightily
proud
to
have
the
honour
of
taking
the
famous
huntsman
therefore
he
observed
the
promised
quarter
very
honourably
and
in
dutch
fashion
which
is
to
take
from
their
spanish
prisoners
of
war
nothing
that
they
carry
under
their
belt
nay
he
did
not
even
have
me
searched
but
i
had
wit
enough
to
take
the
money
out
of
my
pockets
and
present
it
to
him
when
they
came
to
a
division
of
spoils
and
also
i
told
the
cornet
secretly
to
look
to
it
that
he
got
as
his
share
my
horse
saddle
and
harness
for
he
would
find
thirty
ducats
in
the
saddle
and
the
horse
had
hardly
his
equal
anywhere
and
for
this
cause
the
cornet
was
as
much
my
friend
as
if
i
had
been
his
own
brother
for
at
once
he
mounted
my
horse
and
set
me
on
his
own
but
of
the
escort
no
more
than
six
were
dead
and
thirteen
prisoners
of
whom
eight
were
wounded
the
rest
fled
and
had
not
heart
enough
to
retake
the
booty
from
the
enemy
in
fair
field
the
which
they
could
have
done
as
being
all
mounted
men
against
infantry
now
when
the
plunder
and
the
prisoners
had
been
shared
the
swedes
and
hessians
for
they
were
from
different
garrisons
separated
the
same
evening
but
the
cornet
kept
me
and
the
corporal
together
with
three
other
dragoons
as
his
share
because
he
had
captured
us
and
so
were
we
brought
to
a
fortress
which
lay
but
a
few
miles
from
our
own
garrison
and
inasmuch
as
i
had
raised
plenty
of
smoke
in
that
town
before
my
name
was
there
well
known
and
i
myself
more
feared
than
loved
so
when
we
had
the
place
in
sight
the
cornet
sent
a
trooper
in
advance
to
announce
his
coming
to
the
commandant
and
to
tell
him
how
he
had
fared
and
who
the
prisoners
were
whereat
there
was
a
concourse
in
the
town
that
was
not
to
be
described
for
each
would
fain
see
the
huntsman
one
said
this
of
me
and
another
that
and
the
sight
was
for
all
the
world
as
if
some
great
potentate
had
made
his
entry
but
we
prisoners
were
brought
straight
to
the
commandant
who
was
much
amazed
at
my
youth
and
asked
had
i
never
served
on
the
swedish
side
and
of
what
country
i
was
and
when
i
told
him
the
truth
he
would
know
if
i
had
no
desire
to
serve
again
on
their
side
i
answered
him
that
in
other
respects
was
to
me
indifferent
but
that
i
had
sworn
an
oath
to
the
emperor
and
therefore
methought
was
my
duty
to
keep
such
thereupon
he
ordered
us
to
be
taken
to
the
but
allowed
the
cornet
at
his
request
to
treat
us
as
his
guests
because
i
had
before
so
treated
mine
own
prisoners
and
among
them
his
own
brother
so
when
evening
was
come
there
was
a
gathering
both
of
soldiers
of
fortune
and
cavaliers
of
birth
at
the
cornet
quarters
who
sent
for
me
and
the
corporal
and
there
was
i
to
speak
the
truth
extraordinary
courteously
entreated
by
them
i
made
merry
as
if
i
had
lost
nothing
and
carried
myself
as
confidently
and
as
i
had
been
no
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
my
enemy
but
among
my
best
friends
yet
i
shewed
myself
as
modest
as
might
be
for
i
could
well
imagine
that
my
behaviour
would
be
noted
to
the
commandant
which
was
so
as
i
afterwards
learned
next
day
we
prisoners
one
after
another
were
brought
before
the
regimental
who
examined
us
the
corporal
first
and
me
second
but
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
room
he
was
filled
with
wonder
at
my
youth
and
to
cast
it
in
my
teeth
my
child
says
he
what
have
the
swedes
done
to
thee
that
thou
shouldst
fight
against
them
now
this
angered
me
for
i
had
seen
as
young
soldiers
among
them
as
i
was
so
i
answered
the
swedes
had
robbed
me
of
my
coral
and
bells
and
my
baby
rattle
and
i
would
have
them
back
and
as
i
thus
paid
him
back
in
his
own
coin
the
officers
that
sat
by
him
were
shamed
insomuch
that
one
of
them
began
to
say
to
him
in
latin
he
should
treat
me
seriously
for
he
could
hear
that
it
was
no
child
that
he
had
before
him
in
that
i
was
ware
that
his
name
was
eusebius
for
the
officer
so
addressed
him
so
presently
when
he
had
asked
my
name
and
i
had
told
him
there
is
no
devil
in
hell
says
he
that
is
called
simplicissimus
nay
answered
i
and
is
like
there
is
none
named
eusebius
and
so
i
paid
him
back
like
our
old
cyriack
yet
this
pleased
not
the
officers
who
bade
me
remember
i
was
their
prisoner
and
was
not
brought
there
to
pass
jests
at
this
reproof
i
blushed
not
but
answered
inasmuch
as
they
held
me
prisoner
like
a
soldier
and
would
not
let
me
run
away
like
a
child
i
had
taken
care
that
they
should
not
make
sport
with
me
as
with
a
child
as
i
had
been
questioned
so
had
i
answered
and
hoped
i
had
done
no
wrong
therein
so
they
asked
me
of
my
country
and
my
family
but
especially
if
i
had
never
served
on
the
swedish
side
item
how
it
was
with
the
garrison
of
soest
how
strong
it
was
and
all
the
rest
to
all
which
i
answered
quick
and
short
and
well
and
in
respect
of
soest
and
its
garrison
as
much
as
i
could
confidently
state
yet
i
might
well
keep
silence
concerning
my
life
as
a
jester
for
of
this
i
was
ashamed
on
what
condition
the
huntsman
was
set
free
meanwhile
was
known
at
soest
how
it
had
fared
with
the
convoy
how
i
and
the
corporal
had
been
captured
and
whither
we
had
been
taken
and
therefore
next
day
came
a
drummer
to
fetch
us
back
whereupon
the
corporal
and
the
three
others
were
delivered
up
together
with
a
letter
to
the
following
purport
for
the
commandant
sent
it
to
me
to
read
monsieur
by
the
bearer
your
tambour
your
message
hath
been
delivered
and
in
answer
thereto
i
restore
herewith
in
return
for
ransom
received
the
corporal
and
the
three
other
prisoners
but
as
concerns
simplicissimus
called
the
huntsman
the
same
can
not
be
allowed
to
return
as
having
once
served
on
this
side
but
if
i
can
serve
your
honour
in
any
matters
short
of
those
touching
my
allegiance
you
have
in
me
a
willing
servant
and
as
such
i
remain
your
honour
obedient
servant
daniel
de
s
aint
a
ndré
now
this
letter
did
not
half
please
me
yet
i
must
return
thanks
to
him
for
suffering
me
to
see
it
but
when
i
asked
to
speak
with
the
commandant
i
received
answer
he
would
himself
send
for
me
as
soon
as
he
had
despatched
the
drummer
which
should
be
done
next
morning
till
then
i
must
be
patient
so
when
i
had
waited
the
appointed
time
the
commandant
sent
for
me
and
that
just
at
and
then
for
the
first
time
the
honour
fell
to
me
of
sitting
at
table
with
him
and
so
long
as
the
meal
lasted
he
drank
to
my
health
and
said
no
word
great
or
small
of
the
business
he
had
with
me
nor
was
it
my
part
to
begin
but
the
meal
now
ended
and
i
being
somewhat
fuddled
says
he
my
friend
the
huntsman
ye
will
have
understood
from
my
letter
under
what
pretext
i
have
kept
ye
here
and
indeed
i
intend
no
wrong
or
anything
contrary
to
reason
and
the
usage
of
war
for
yourself
have
confessed
to
me
and
the
that
you
once
served
on
our
side
in
the
main
army
and
therefore
must
resolve
yourself
to
take
service
under
my
command
and
in
time
if
ye
behave
yourself
well
i
will
so
advance
you
as
ye
could
never
have
hoped
for
among
the
imperials
otherwise
ye
must
not
take
it
ill
if
i
send
you
to
that
from
whom
the
dragoons
before
captured
you
to
which
i
answered
worshipful
colonel
for
at
that
time
was
not
the
usage
that
soldiers
of
fortune
were
entitled
your
honour
even
though
they
were
colonels
i
hope
since
i
am
bound
by
oath
neither
to
the
crown
of
sweden
nor
its
confederates
and
still
less
to
that
that
i
am
therefore
not
bound
to
take
service
with
the
swedes
and
so
to
break
the
oath
which
i
swore
to
the
emperor
and
therefore
beg
the
worshipful
colonel
with
all
humility
to
be
good
enough
to
relieve
me
from
such
a
proposal
how
says
the
colonel
do
ye
despise
the
swedish
service
i
would
have
you
to
know
ye
are
my
prisoner
and
sooner
than
let
you
go
to
soest
to
do
the
enemy
service
i
will
bring
you
to
another
trial
or
let
you
rot
in
prison
and
so
said
he
i
might
lay
my
account
truly
at
these
words
i
was
afeared
yet
would
not
yet
give
in
but
answered
god
would
protect
me
both
from
such
despiteful
treatment
and
from
perjury
for
the
rest
i
persisted
in
my
humble
hope
that
the
colonel
would
according
to
his
known
reputation
deal
with
me
as
with
a
soldier
yea
said
he
i
know
well
how
i
could
treat
ye
if
i
would
be
strict
but
be
ye
better
advised
lest
i
find
cause
to
shew
you
other
countenance
and
with
that
i
was
led
back
to
the
prison
and
now
can
any
man
easily
guess
that
i
slept
not
much
that
night
but
had
all
manner
of
thoughts
and
next
morning
came
certain
officers
with
the
cornet
that
had
taken
me
under
colour
of
passing
the
time
but
in
truth
to
tell
me
that
the
colonel
was
minded
to
have
me
tried
as
a
sorcerer
if
i
would
not
otherwise
be
content
so
would
they
have
terrified
me
and
found
out
what
my
powers
were
yet
as
i
had
the
comfort
of
a
good
conscience
i
took
all
coolly
and
said
but
little
as
seeing
well
that
the
colonel
cared
for
nothing
but
this
that
he
would
fain
have
me
no
more
at
soest
and
well
might
he
suppose
that
if
he
once
let
me
go
i
should
not
leave
that
place
where
i
hoped
for
promotion
and
moreover
had
two
fine
horses
there
and
other
things
of
price
next
day
he
had
me
brought
to
him
again
and
asked
had
i
resolved
otherwise
so
i
answered
colonel
to
this
i
am
determined
that
i
will
sooner
die
than
be
perjured
yet
if
the
worshipful
colonel
will
set
me
free
and
be
pleased
not
to
call
upon
me
to
do
any
warlike
service
then
will
i
promise
him
with
heart
mouth
and
hand
to
bear
and
use
no
arms
against
the
swedes
and
hessians
for
the
space
of
six
months
to
that
he
agreed
at
once
gave
me
his
hand
upon
it
and
forgave
me
my
ransom
further
he
commanded
his
secretary
to
draw
up
an
agreement
to
that
effect
in
duplicate
which
we
both
subscribed
wherein
he
promised
me
protection
and
all
freedom
so
long
as
i
should
remain
in
the
fortress
entrusted
to
him
on
the
other
hand
i
bound
myself
to
the
two
points
above
named
videlicet
that
i
so
long
as
i
should
sojourn
in
the
said
fortress
would
neither
undertake
anything
to
the
hurt
of
the
garrison
and
its
commander
nor
would
conceal
aught
that
was
intended
to
their
prejudice
and
damage
but
would
much
more
further
their
profit
and
benefit
and
prevent
any
damage
to
them
to
the
best
of
my
ability
yea
that
if
the
place
were
attacked
i
should
and
would
help
to
defend
it
thereupon
he
kept
me
to
dine
with
him
again
and
shewed
me
more
honour
than
i
could
in
all
my
lifetime
have
looked
for
from
the
imperials
and
so
by
little
and
little
he
won
me
over
till
i
would
not
have
returned
to
soest
even
if
he
had
let
me
go
thither
and
had
accounted
me
free
from
my
promise
how
simplicissimus
became
a
nobleman
when
a
thing
is
to
be
all
things
shape
themselves
to
that
end
now
did
i
conceive
that
fortune
had
taken
me
to
husband
or
at
least
bound
herself
so
close
to
me
that
the
most
contrary
happenings
must
turn
out
to
my
profit
as
when
i
learned
at
the
commandant
table
that
my
servant
with
my
two
fine
horses
had
come
from
soest
but
i
knew
not
what
at
last
i
found
that
tricky
fortune
hath
the
sirens
art
who
do
shew
themselves
kindest
to
those
to
whom
they
wish
most
harm
and
so
doth
raise
a
man
the
higher
but
for
this
end
to
cast
him
down
the
deeper
now
this
servant
which
i
had
before
captured
from
the
swedes
was
beyond
measure
true
to
me
who
had
done
him
great
kindnesses
he
therefore
had
saddled
my
two
horses
and
rode
out
a
good
way
from
soest
to
meet
the
drummer
that
should
bring
me
back
that
not
only
i
might
not
have
to
walk
so
far
but
also
that
i
might
not
have
to
return
to
soest
naked
or
in
rags
for
he
conceived
i
had
been
stripped
so
when
he
met
the
drummer
and
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
there
he
had
my
best
clothing
in
a
pack
but
when
he
saw
me
not
but
understood
i
was
kept
back
to
take
service
with
the
adversary
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
says
he
adieu
tambours
and
you
too
corporal
where
my
master
is
there
will
i
be
also
so
he
escaped
and
came
to
me
at
the
very
time
when
the
commandant
had
set
me
free
and
was
shewing
me
such
great
honour
who
thereupon
bestowed
my
horses
in
an
inn
till
i
could
find
for
myself
a
lodging
to
my
liking
and
called
me
fortunate
by
reason
of
my
servant
faith
yet
wondered
that
i
as
a
common
dragoon
and
so
young
to
boot
should
possess
such
fine
horses
and
be
so
well
equipped
nay
when
i
had
taken
leave
and
would
go
to
my
inn
he
praised
one
horse
so
loudly
that
i
marked
well
he
would
fain
have
bought
him
from
me
yet
because
from
modesty
he
ventured
not
to
make
a
bid
i
said
if
i
might
beg
for
the
honour
of
his
keeping
the
horse
it
was
at
his
service
but
he
refused
roundly
more
because
i
was
fairly
tipsy
and
he
would
not
have
the
reproach
of
talking
a
present
out
of
a
drunken
man
who
might
thereafter
repent
of
it
than
because
he
would
not
fain
have
had
that
noble
horse
that
night
i
did
consider
how
i
would
order
my
life
in
time
to
come
and
did
decide
to
remain
for
the
six
months
even
where
i
was
and
so
in
peace
to
spend
the
winter
which
was
now
at
hand
for
which
i
knew
i
had
money
enough
for
my
purposes
without
breaking
into
my
treasure
at
cologne
in
so
long
a
time
thought
i
thou
wilt
be
full
grown
and
come
to
thy
full
strength
and
so
canst
thou
next
spring
take
the
field
with
more
boldness
among
the
emperor
troops
early
next
morning
i
reviewed
my
saddle
which
was
far
better
lined
than
the
one
i
had
presented
to
the
cornet
and
later
on
i
had
my
horse
led
to
the
colonel
quarters
and
told
him
as
i
had
determined
to
spend
the
six
months
in
which
was
forbidden
me
to
fight
peaceably
and
under
the
colonel
protection
here
my
horses
were
of
no
use
to
me
which
yet
pity
should
be
spoiled
and
therefore
begged
him
that
he
would
consent
to
grant
this
charger
here
present
a
place
among
his
own
horses
and
accept
the
same
from
me
as
a
mark
of
grateful
acknowledgment
of
favours
received
and
that
without
scruple
the
colonel
returned
me
thanks
with
great
civility
and
very
courteous
offers
of
service
and
the
same
afternoon
sent
me
by
his
steward
one
fat
ox
alive
two
fat
pigs
a
hogshead
of
wine
two
hogsheads
of
beer
twelve
cords
of
firewood
all
which
he
caused
to
be
brought
to
me
in
front
of
my
new
lodging
which
i
had
even
now
hired
for
half
a
year
and
sent
a
message
that
as
he
saw
i
was
to
live
with
him
and
could
easily
conceive
that
i
was
at
first
with
victual
he
had
therefore
sent
me
for
household
use
a
draught
of
wine
and
a
joint
of
meat
together
with
the
fuel
to
cook
the
same
with
this
in
addition
that
whereinsoever
he
could
help
me
he
would
not
fail
for
which
i
returned
thanks
as
civilly
as
i
could
presented
the
steward
with
two
ducats
and
begged
him
to
commend
me
to
his
master
so
when
i
saw
i
had
gained
such
credit
with
the
colonel
for
my
liberality
i
thought
to
earn
praise
also
among
the
common
folk
that
none
should
take
me
for
a
mere
malingerer
to
that
end
i
had
my
servant
called
before
me
in
presence
of
my
landlord
and
friend
nicolas
said
i
thou
hast
shewn
me
more
faithfulness
than
any
master
can
expect
from
his
servant
but
now
when
i
know
not
how
to
make
it
up
to
thee
as
having
no
master
and
no
leave
to
fight
wherefrom
i
might
gain
booty
enough
to
reward
thee
as
i
would
fain
do
and
in
respect
also
of
the
peaceful
life
which
i
do
intend
henceforth
to
live
and
therefore
do
need
no
servitor
i
herewith
give
thee
as
thy
pay
the
other
horse
with
saddle
harness
and
pistols
with
the
request
that
thou
wouldst
be
content
for
the
present
to
seek
another
master
and
if
i
hereafter
can
serve
thee
in
any
way
do
thou
not
fail
to
ask
me
with
that
he
kissed
my
hands
and
for
tears
could
not
speak
but
would
by
no
means
have
the
horse
but
held
it
better
i
should
turn
it
into
money
to
use
for
my
maintenance
yet
at
last
i
persuaded
him
to
take
it
after
i
had
promised
to
take
him
again
into
my
service
so
soon
as
i
should
need
a
man
at
this
parting
my
landlord
was
so
moved
that
his
eyes
also
filled
with
tears
and
as
my
servant
exalted
me
among
the
soldiers
for
this
action
so
did
my
landlord
among
the
citizens
as
to
the
commandant
he
held
me
for
so
determined
a
fellow
that
he
would
have
ventured
to
build
upon
my
word
since
i
did
not
only
truly
keep
the
oath
i
had
sworn
to
the
emperor
but
in
order
to
keep
that
other
promise
which
i
had
made
to
himself
with
great
strictness
had
rid
myself
of
my
fine
horses
my
arms
and
my
most
faithful
servant
how
the
huntsman
disposed
himself
to
pass
his
six
months
and
also
somewhat
of
the
prophetess
i
do
think
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
that
hath
not
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
for
we
be
all
men
of
one
mould
and
by
mine
own
fruits
i
can
mark
how
others
ripen
oh
coxcomb
say
you
if
thou
beest
a
fool
thinkest
thou
others
must
be
too
nay
that
were
to
say
too
much
but
this
i
maintain
that
one
man
can
hide
his
folly
better
than
another
nor
is
a
man
a
fool
because
he
hath
foolish
fantasies
for
in
youth
we
do
all
have
the
like
and
he
that
lets
those
fantasies
run
loose
is
held
to
be
a
fool
because
others
keep
the
fool
concealed
and
others
do
but
shew
the
half
of
him
they
that
keep
such
whims
under
altogether
be
but
peevish
fellows
but
they
that
now
and
then
allow
them
as
time
affords
an
opportunity
to
shew
their
ears
and
put
their
heads
out
of
window
to
get
air
lest
they
be
choked
these
i
hold
for
the
best
and
wisest
men
mine
own
fantasies
i
let
forth
only
too
far
as
seeing
myself
so
free
and
well
provided
with
money
so
that
i
took
me
a
lad
whom
i
clothed
as
a
nobleman
page
and
that
in
the
most
fantastic
colours
to
wit
light
brown
bordered
with
yellow
which
must
be
my
livery
for
so
i
fancied
it
and
he
must
wait
upon
me
as
if
i
were
a
nobleman
and
not
until
just
before
a
common
dragoon
yea
and
half
a
year
before
a
poor
now
this
the
first
folly
i
committed
in
this
town
though
was
pretty
gross
yet
was
remarked
by
none
much
less
blamed
but
why
the
world
is
so
full
of
such
fooleries
that
none
marks
them
now
nor
laughs
at
them
nor
wonders
at
them
for
all
are
used
to
them
and
so
was
i
held
for
a
wise
and
good
soldier
and
not
for
a
fool
only
fit
for
shoes
then
i
bargained
with
my
landlord
for
the
feeding
of
my
page
and
myself
and
gave
him
as
payment
on
account
what
the
commandant
had
presented
to
me
as
far
as
concerns
food
and
fuel
but
for
the
drink
my
page
must
keep
the
key
for
i
was
very
willing
to
give
of
such
to
all
that
visited
me
and
since
i
was
neither
citizen
nor
soldier
and
therefore
had
no
equals
that
were
bound
to
keep
me
company
i
consorted
with
both
sides
and
therefore
daily
found
comrades
enough
and
these
i
sent
not
away
dry
among
the
citizens
i
had
most
friendship
with
the
organist
for
music
i
loved
and
without
bragging
had
an
excellent
voice
which
i
had
no
mind
to
let
rust
this
man
taught
me
how
to
compose
and
to
play
better
upon
that
instrument
as
also
upon
the
harp
on
the
lute
i
was
already
a
master
so
i
got
me
one
of
mine
own
and
daily
diverted
myself
with
it
and
when
i
was
tired
of
music
i
would
send
for
that
furrier
that
had
instructed
me
in
the
use
of
all
arms
in
paradise
and
with
him
exercised
myself
to
be
yet
more
perfect
also
i
obtained
leave
from
the
commandant
that
one
of
his
artillerymen
should
instruct
me
in
gunnery
and
something
of
for
a
proper
reward
for
the
rest
i
kept
myself
quiet
and
retired
so
that
people
wondered
seeing
how
i
that
had
been
used
to
plunder
and
bloodshed
now
sat
always
over
my
books
like
a
student
but
my
host
was
the
commandant
spy
and
my
keeper
for
well
i
noted
that
he
reported
to
him
all
my
ways
and
works
but
that
suited
me
well
enough
for
of
warfare
i
had
never
a
thought
and
if
there
was
talk
of
it
i
behaved
myself
as
i
had
never
been
a
soldier
and
was
only
there
to
perform
my
daily
exercises
of
which
i
but
now
made
mention
is
true
i
wished
my
six
months
at
an
end
yet
could
no
man
guess
which
side
i
would
then
serve
as
often
as
i
waited
on
the
colonel
he
would
have
me
to
dine
with
him
and
then
at
times
the
converse
was
so
arranged
that
my
intention
might
be
known
therefrom
but
ever
i
answered
so
discreetly
that
none
could
know
what
i
did
mean
so
once
when
he
said
to
me
how
with
ye
huntsman
will
ye
not
yet
turn
swede
an
ensign
of
mine
is
dead
yesterday
i
made
answer
worshipful
colonel
seeing
that
it
is
but
decent
for
a
woman
not
to
marry
at
once
again
after
her
husband
death
should
i
not
also
wait
my
six
months
in
such
fashion
i
escaped
every
time
and
gained
the
colonel
good
will
more
and
more
so
much
so
that
he
allowed
me
to
take
my
walks
both
inside
and
outside
the
fortress
yea
at
last
i
might
hunt
the
hares
partridges
and
birds
which
was
not
permitted
to
his
own
soldiers
likewise
did
i
fish
in
the
lippe
and
was
so
lucky
at
that
that
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
conjure
both
fish
and
crayfish
out
of
the
water
for
this
i
caused
to
be
made
a
rough
only
in
which
i
crept
by
night
into
the
territory
of
soest
and
collected
my
hidden
treasures
from
here
and
there
and
brought
them
to
the
said
fortress
and
so
behaved
as
if
i
would
for
ever
dwell
among
the
swedes
by
the
same
way
came
the
prophetess
of
soest
to
me
and
said
lookye
my
son
did
i
not
counsel
thee
well
before
that
thou
shouldst
hide
thy
money
outside
the
town
of
soest
i
do
assure
thee
is
thy
greater
good
luck
to
have
been
captured
for
hadst
thou
returned
to
soest
certain
fellows
that
had
sworn
thy
death
because
thou
wast
preferred
to
them
among
the
women
would
have
murdered
thee
in
thy
hunting
so
i
asked
how
could
any
be
jealous
of
me
that
meddled
with
women
not
at
all
oh
says
she
of
that
opinion
that
thou
art
now
wilt
thou
not
long
remain
or
the
women
will
drive
thee
out
of
the
country
with
mockery
and
shame
thou
hast
ever
laughed
at
me
when
i
foretold
thee
aught
wouldest
thou
once
more
refuse
to
believe
me
if
i
told
thee
more
dost
thou
not
find
in
the
place
where
thou
art
better
friends
than
in
soest
i
do
swear
to
thee
they
hold
thee
only
too
dear
and
that
such
exceeding
love
will
turn
to
thy
harm
if
thou
submit
not
to
it
so
i
answered
her
if
she
truly
knew
so
much
as
she
gave
out
she
should
reveal
to
me
how
it
stood
with
my
parents
and
whether
i
should
ever
in
my
life
come
to
them
again
she
should
not
be
so
dark
in
her
sayings
but
out
with
it
in
good
german
thereupon
she
said
i
might
ask
after
my
parents
when
my
should
meet
me
unawares
and
lead
my
daughter
by
a
string
with
that
she
laughed
loud
and
at
the
end
said
she
had
of
her
own
accord
told
to
me
more
than
to
others
that
had
begged
it
of
her
but
as
i
began
to
jest
upon
her
she
quickly
took
herself
away
after
i
had
presented
her
with
a
few
thalers
for
i
had
more
silver
coin
than
i
could
easily
carry
having
at
that
time
a
pretty
sum
of
money
and
many
rings
and
jewels
of
great
price
for
before
this
whenever
i
heard
of
precious
stones
among
the
soldiers
or
found
such
on
expeditions
or
elsewhere
i
bought
them
and
that
for
less
than
half
the
money
they
were
worth
such
treasures
did
always
cry
aloud
to
me
to
let
them
be
seen
in
public
and
i
did
willingly
obey
for
being
of
a
pretty
proud
temper
i
made
a
show
with
my
wealth
and
feared
not
to
let
mine
host
see
it
who
made
it
out
to
others
as
greater
than
it
was
and
they
did
wonder
whence
i
had
gathered
it
all
together
it
being
well
known
that
i
had
made
deposit
at
cologne
of
the
treasure
i
had
found
for
the
cornet
had
read
the
merchant
receipt
when
he
took
me
prisoner
how
the
huntsman
went
a
wooing
and
made
a
trade
of
it
my
intent
to
learn
artillery
practice
and
fencing
in
these
six
months
was
good
and
that
i
knew
yet
was
not
enough
to
protect
me
from
idleness
which
is
the
root
of
many
evils
and
especially
ill
for
me
because
i
had
no
one
to
command
me
is
true
i
sat
industriously
over
books
of
all
sorts
from
which
i
learned
much
good
but
a
few
came
into
my
hands
which
were
as
good
for
me
as
grass
for
a
sick
dog
the
incomparable
arcadia
from
which
i
sought
to
learn
eloquence
was
the
first
book
that
led
me
aside
from
good
stories
to
books
of
love
and
from
true
history
to
romances
of
chivalry
such
sort
of
books
i
collected
wherever
i
could
and
when
i
found
one
i
ceased
not
till
i
had
read
it
through
though
i
should
sit
day
and
night
over
it
but
these
taught
me
instead
of
eloquence
to
practise
lechery
yet
was
such
desire
at
no
time
so
violent
and
strong
that
one
could
with
seneca
call
it
a
divine
frenzy
or
as
it
is
described
in
thomas
thomai
forest
garden
a
serious
sickness
for
where
i
took
a
fancy
there
i
had
what
i
desired
easily
and
without
great
trouble
and
so
had
i
no
cause
to
complain
as
other
wooers
and
lechers
have
had
which
are
chock
full
of
fantastic
thoughts
troubles
desires
secret
pangs
anger
jealousy
revenge
madness
tears
bragging
threats
and
numberless
other
follies
and
for
sheer
impatience
wish
for
death
for
i
had
money
and
was
not
too
careful
of
it
and
besides
i
had
a
fine
voice
which
daily
i
exercised
with
all
manner
of
instruments
instead
of
shewing
my
bodily
skill
in
the
dance
which
i
did
never
love
i
did
display
it
in
fencing
engaging
with
my
furrier
moreover
i
had
a
fine
smooth
face
and
did
practise
myself
in
a
certain
gracious
amiableness
so
that
the
women
even
those
that
i
did
not
greatly
seek
after
did
of
themselves
run
after
me
and
that
more
than
i
desired
about
this
time
came
martinmas
then
with
us
germans
begins
the
eating
and
swilling
and
that
feast
is
full
conscientiously
observed
till
shrovetide
so
was
i
invited
to
different
houses
both
among
the
officers
and
burghers
to
help
eat
the
martinmas
goose
so
was
that
on
such
occasions
i
made
acquaintance
with
the
ladies
for
my
lute
and
my
songs
made
all
to
look
my
way
and
when
they
so
looked
then
was
i
ready
to
add
such
charming
looks
and
actions
to
my
new
which
i
did
myself
compose
that
many
a
fair
maid
was
befooled
and
ere
she
knew
it
was
in
love
with
me
yet
lest
i
should
be
held
for
a
curmudgeon
i
gave
likewise
two
banquets
one
for
the
officers
and
one
for
the
chief
citizens
by
which
means
i
gained
me
favour
of
both
parties
and
an
entry
to
their
houses
for
i
spared
no
expense
in
my
entertainment
but
all
this
was
but
for
the
sake
of
the
sweet
maids
and
though
i
did
not
at
once
find
what
i
sought
with
each
and
everyone
for
some
there
were
that
could
deny
me
yet
i
went
often
to
these
also
that
so
they
might
bring
them
that
did
shew
me
more
favour
than
becomes
modest
maidens
into
no
suspicion
but
might
believe
that
i
visited
these
last
also
only
for
the
sake
of
conversation
and
so
separately
i
persuaded
each
one
to
believe
this
of
the
others
and
to
think
she
was
the
only
one
that
enjoyed
my
love
just
six
i
had
that
loved
me
well
and
i
them
in
return
yet
none
possessed
my
heart
or
me
alone
in
one
was
but
the
black
eyes
that
pleased
me
in
another
the
golden
hair
in
a
third
a
winning
sweetness
and
in
the
others
was
also
somewhat
that
the
rest
had
not
but
if
i
besides
these
also
visited
others
was
either
for
the
cause
i
mentioned
or
because
their
acquaintance
was
new
and
strange
to
me
and
in
any
case
i
refused
and
despised
nothing
as
not
purposing
always
to
remain
in
the
same
place
my
page
which
was
an
had
enough
to
do
with
carrying
of
back
and
forth
and
knew
how
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
my
loose
ways
so
secret
from
one
and
the
other
that
nought
was
discovered
in
reward
for
which
he
had
from
the
baggages
many
presents
which
yet
cost
me
most
seeing
that
i
spent
a
little
fortune
on
them
and
could
well
say
what
is
won
with
the
drum
is
lost
with
the
fife
all
the
same
i
kept
my
affairs
so
secret
that
not
one
man
in
a
hundred
would
have
taken
me
for
a
rake
save
only
the
priest
from
whom
i
borrowed
not
so
many
good
books
as
formerly
by
what
means
the
huntsman
made
friends
and
how
he
was
moved
by
a
sermon
when
fortune
will
cast
a
man
down
she
raiseth
him
first
to
the
heights
and
the
good
god
doth
faithfully
warn
every
man
before
his
fall
such
a
warning
had
i
but
would
have
none
of
it
for
i
was
stiffly
persuaded
of
this
that
my
fortune
was
so
firmly
founded
that
no
mishap
could
cast
me
down
because
all
and
specially
the
commandant
himself
wished
me
well
those
that
he
valued
i
won
over
by
all
manner
of
respect
his
trusted
servants
i
brought
over
to
my
side
by
presents
and
with
them
perhaps
more
than
with
mine
equals
i
did
drink
brotherhood
and
swore
to
them
everlasting
faith
and
friendship
so
too
the
common
citizens
and
soldiers
loved
me
because
i
had
a
friendly
word
for
all
what
a
kindly
man
said
they
often
is
the
huntsman
he
will
talk
with
a
child
in
the
street
and
hath
a
quarrel
with
no
man
if
i
had
shot
a
hare
or
a
few
partridges
i
would
send
them
to
the
kitchen
of
those
whose
friendship
i
sought
and
also
invited
myself
as
a
guest
at
which
time
i
would
always
have
a
sup
of
wine
which
was
in
that
place
very
dear
brought
thither
also
yea
i
would
so
contrive
it
that
the
whole
cost
would
fall
upon
me
and
when
at
such
banquets
i
fell
in
converse
with
any
i
had
praise
for
all
save
myself
and
managed
so
to
feign
humility
as
i
had
never
known
pride
so
because
i
thus
gained
the
favour
of
all
and
all
thought
much
of
me
i
never
conceived
that
any
misfortune
could
encounter
me
especially
since
my
purse
was
still
pretty
well
filled
often
i
went
to
the
oldest
priest
of
the
town
who
lent
me
many
books
from
his
library
and
when
i
brought
one
back
then
would
he
discourse
of
all
manner
of
matters
with
me
for
we
became
so
familiar
together
that
one
could
easily
bear
with
the
other
so
when
not
only
the
martinmas
goose
and
the
feast
of
were
gone
and
over
but
also
the
christmas
holidays
i
presented
to
him
for
the
new
year
a
bottle
of
strassburg
branntwein
the
which
he
after
westphalian
use
liked
to
sip
with
and
thereafter
came
to
visit
him
even
as
he
was
my
joseph
the
chaste
which
my
host
without
my
knowledge
had
lent
him
i
did
blush
that
my
work
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
so
learned
a
man
especially
because
men
hold
that
one
is
best
known
by
what
he
writes
but
he
would
have
me
to
sit
by
him
and
praised
my
invention
yet
blamed
me
that
i
had
lingered
so
long
over
the
of
zuleika
which
was
potiphar
wife
out
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh
said
he
moreover
and
if
my
friend
had
not
known
how
it
fares
with
a
wooer
heart
he
could
never
so
well
have
treated
of
this
woman
passion
or
in
so
lively
fashion
pictured
it
i
answered
that
what
i
had
written
was
not
mine
own
invention
but
extracted
from
other
books
to
give
me
some
practice
in
writing
yes
yes
says
he
of
course
i
am
pleased
to
believe
it
yet
may
you
be
sure
i
know
more
of
your
honour
than
he
conceives
at
these
words
i
was
dismayed
and
thought
hath
a
little
bird
told
thee
but
he
seeing
how
i
changed
colour
went
on
to
say
ye
are
lively
and
young
idle
and
handsome
ye
do
live
a
careless
life
and
as
i
hear
in
all
luxury
therefore
do
i
beseech
you
in
the
lord
and
exhort
you
to
consider
in
what
an
evil
case
you
stand
beware
of
the
beast
with
the
long
hair
if
you
have
any
care
for
your
happiness
and
health
ye
may
perhaps
say
concerneth
it
the
priest
what
i
do
or
not
guessed
said
i
to
myself
or
right
hath
he
to
command
me
is
true
i
have
but
the
care
of
souls
but
sir
be
assured
that
your
temporal
good
as
that
of
my
benefactor
is
for
mere
christian
love
as
precious
as
if
ye
were
mine
own
son
is
ever
a
pity
and
never
can
ye
answer
such
a
charge
before
your
heavenly
father
if
ye
do
bury
the
talent
he
hath
entrusted
to
you
and
leave
to
go
to
ruin
that
noble
understanding
which
i
do
perceive
in
this
your
writing
my
faithful
and
fatherly
advice
would
be
ye
should
employ
your
youth
and
your
means
which
ye
now
do
waste
in
such
purposeless
wise
to
study
that
some
day
ye
may
be
helpful
to
god
and
man
and
yourself
and
let
war
alone
in
which
as
i
do
hear
ye
have
so
great
a
delight
and
before
ye
get
a
shrewd
knock
and
find
the
truth
of
that
saying
soldiers
make
old
beggars
this
predication
i
listened
to
with
great
impatience
for
i
was
not
used
to
hear
the
like
yet
i
shewed
not
how
i
felt
lest
i
should
forfeit
my
reputation
for
politeness
but
thanked
him
much
for
his
straightforwardness
and
promised
him
to
reflect
upon
his
advice
yet
thought
i
within
myself
what
did
it
concern
the
priest
how
i
ordered
my
life
for
just
then
i
was
at
the
height
of
my
good
fortune
and
i
could
not
do
without
those
pleasures
of
dalliance
i
had
once
enjoyed
so
is
it
ever
with
such
warnings
when
youth
is
unaccustomed
to
bit
and
bridle
and
gallops
hard
away
to
meet
destruction
how
he
gave
the
faithful
priest
other
fish
to
fry
to
cause
him
to
forget
his
own
hoggish
life
yet
was
i
not
so
drowned
in
lust
nor
so
dull
as
not
to
take
care
to
keep
all
men
affection
so
long
as
i
was
minded
to
sojourn
in
that
fortress
that
is
till
winter
was
over
and
i
knew
well
what
trouble
it
might
breed
for
a
man
if
he
should
earn
the
ill
will
of
the
clergy
they
being
folk
that
in
all
nations
no
matter
of
what
religion
they
be
enjoy
great
credit
so
i
put
on
my
considering
cap
and
the
very
next
day
i
betook
myself
to
the
said
pastor
and
told
him
in
fine
words
such
a
heap
of
lies
how
i
had
resolved
to
follow
his
advice
that
he
as
i
could
see
from
his
carriage
was
heartily
rejoiced
thereat
yea
said
i
up
till
this
time
yea
and
in
soest
also
there
was
wanting
for
me
nothing
but
such
an
angelic
counsellor
as
i
have
found
in
your
reverence
were
but
the
winter
over
or
at
least
the
weather
better
so
that
i
could
travel
hence
and
thereafter
i
begged
him
to
assist
me
with
his
advice
as
to
which
university
i
should
attend
to
that
he
answered
himself
had
studied
in
leyden
but
he
would
counsel
to
go
to
geneva
for
by
my
speech
i
must
be
from
the
high
germany
jesus
maria
said
i
geneva
is
farther
from
my
home
than
leyden
can
i
believe
mine
ears
says
he
is
plain
your
honour
is
a
papist
great
heavens
how
am
i
deceived
how
so
pastor
said
i
must
i
be
a
papist
because
i
will
not
to
geneva
nay
says
he
but
ye
do
call
upon
the
name
of
mary
how
said
i
not
well
for
a
christian
to
name
the
mother
of
his
redeemer
true
says
he
yet
would
i
counsel
your
honour
and
beg
of
him
as
earnestly
as
i
can
to
give
honour
to
god
only
and
further
to
tell
me
plainly
to
what
religion
he
belongs
for
i
doubt
much
if
he
be
evangelical
though
i
have
seen
him
every
sunday
in
my
church
inasmuch
as
at
this
last
christmastide
he
came
not
to
the
table
of
the
lord
neither
here
nor
in
the
lutheran
church
nay
said
i
but
your
reverence
knows
well
that
i
am
a
christian
were
i
not
i
had
not
been
so
oft
at
the
preaching
but
for
the
rest
i
must
confess
that
i
follow
neither
peter
nor
paul
but
do
believe
simply
all
that
the
twelve
articles
of
the
christian
faith
do
contain
nor
will
i
bind
myself
to
either
party
till
one
or
the
other
shall
bring
me
by
sufficient
proofs
to
believe
that
he
rather
than
the
other
doth
possess
the
one
true
religion
of
salvation
thereupon
now
says
he
do
i
truly
and
that
for
the
first
time
understand
that
ye
have
a
true
soldier
spirit
to
risk
your
life
here
there
and
everywhere
since
ye
can
so
live
from
day
to
day
without
religion
or
worship
and
can
so
risk
your
hope
of
eternal
salvation
great
heaven
says
he
how
can
a
mortal
man
that
must
hereafter
be
damned
or
saved
so
defy
all
your
honour
says
he
was
brought
up
in
hanau
hath
he
learned
there
no
better
christianity
than
this
tell
me
why
do
ye
not
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
your
parents
in
the
pure
religion
of
christ
or
why
will
ye
not
betake
yourself
to
this
our
belief
of
which
the
foundations
be
so
plain
both
in
holy
writ
and
nature
that
neither
papist
nor
lutheran
can
ever
upset
them
your
reverence
i
answered
so
say
all
of
their
own
religion
yet
which
am
i
to
believe
think
ye
is
so
light
a
matter
for
me
to
entrust
my
soul
salvation
to
any
one
party
that
doth
revile
the
other
two
and
accuse
them
of
false
doctrine
i
pray
you
to
consider
with
impartial
eyes
what
conrad
vetter
and
johannes
nas
have
written
against
luther
and
also
luther
against
the
pope
but
most
of
all
what
spangenberg
hath
written
against
francis
of
assisi
which
for
hundreds
of
years
hath
been
held
for
a
holy
and
man
and
all
this
in
print
to
which
party
shall
i
betake
myself
when
each
says
of
the
other
that
is
unclean
unclean
doth
your
reverence
think
i
am
wrong
if
i
stay
awhile
till
i
have
got
me
more
understanding
and
know
black
from
white
would
any
man
counsel
me
to
plunge
in
like
a
fly
into
hot
soup
nay
nay
your
reverence
can
not
upon
his
conscience
do
that
without
question
one
religion
must
be
right
and
the
other
two
wrong
and
if
i
should
betake
myself
to
one
without
ripe
reflection
i
might
choose
the
wrong
as
easily
as
the
right
and
so
repent
of
my
choice
for
all
eternity
i
will
sooner
keep
off
the
roads
altogether
than
take
the
wrong
one
besides
there
be
yet
other
religions
besides
these
here
in
europe
as
those
of
the
armenians
the
abyssinians
the
greeks
the
georgians
and
so
forth
and
whichsoever
i
do
choose
then
must
i
with
my
fellow
believers
deny
all
the
rest
but
if
your
reverence
will
but
play
the
part
of
ananias
for
me
and
open
mine
eyes
i
will
with
thankfulness
follow
him
and
take
up
that
religion
to
which
he
belongs
thereupon
your
honour
says
he
is
in
a
great
error
but
i
pray
god
to
enlighten
him
and
help
him
forth
of
the
slough
to
which
end
i
will
hereafter
so
prove
to
him
the
truth
of
our
confession
that
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
i
answered
i
would
await
such
with
great
anxiety
yet
in
my
heart
i
thought
if
thou
trouble
me
no
more
anent
my
lecheries
i
will
be
content
with
thy
belief
and
so
can
the
reader
judge
what
a
godless
wicked
rogue
i
then
was
for
i
did
but
give
the
good
pastor
fruitless
trouble
that
he
might
leave
me
undisturbed
in
my
vicious
life
and
thinks
i
before
thou
art
ready
with
thy
proofs
i
shall
belike
be
where
the
pepper
grows
how
simplicissimus
all
unawares
was
made
a
married
man
now
over
against
my
lodging
there
dwelt
a
on
and
the
same
had
a
very
fair
daughter
of
noble
carriage
whose
acquaintance
i
had
long
desired
to
make
and
though
at
the
first
she
seemed
not
such
an
one
as
i
could
love
and
no
other
and
cleave
to
her
for
ever
yet
i
took
many
a
walk
for
her
sake
and
wasted
many
a
loving
look
who
yet
was
so
carefully
guarded
against
me
that
never
once
could
i
come
to
speak
with
her
as
i
would
have
wished
neither
might
boldly
accost
her
for
i
had
no
acquaintance
with
her
parents
and
indeed
they
seemed
far
too
high
placed
for
a
lad
of
such
low
descent
as
i
deemed
myself
to
be
at
the
most
i
could
approach
her
in
the
going
in
and
out
of
church
and
then
would
i
take
opportunity
to
draw
near
and
with
great
passion
would
heave
out
a
couple
of
sighs
wherein
i
was
a
master
though
all
from
a
feigned
heart
all
which
she
on
the
other
hand
received
so
coldly
that
i
must
well
believe
she
was
not
to
be
fooled
like
any
small
burgher
daughter
and
the
more
i
thought
how
hard
be
for
me
to
compass
her
love
the
hotter
grew
my
desire
for
her
but
the
lucky
star
which
first
brought
me
to
her
was
even
that
one
which
the
scholars
wear
at
a
certain
season
in
everlasting
remembrance
of
how
the
three
wise
men
were
by
such
a
star
led
to
bethlehem
and
i
took
it
for
a
good
omen
that
such
a
star
led
me
to
her
dwelling
also
for
her
father
sending
for
me
monsieur
says
he
that
position
of
neutrality
which
you
do
hold
between
citizens
and
soldiers
is
the
cause
why
i
have
invited
you
hither
for
i
have
need
of
an
impartial
witness
in
a
matter
which
i
have
to
settle
between
two
parties
with
that
i
thought
he
had
some
wondrous
great
undertaking
in
hand
for
papers
and
pens
lay
on
the
table
so
i
tendered
him
my
services
for
all
honourable
ends
adding
thereto
that
i
should
hold
it
for
a
great
honour
indeed
if
i
were
fortunate
enough
to
do
him
service
to
his
liking
yet
was
the
business
nothing
more
than
this
as
is
the
usage
in
many
places
to
set
up
a
kingdom
being
as
was
the
eve
of
the
three
kings
and
my
part
was
to
see
that
all
was
well
and
truly
performed
and
the
offices
distributed
by
lot
without
respect
of
persons
and
for
this
weighty
concern
at
which
his
secretary
also
was
present
my
colonel
must
have
wine
and
confectionery
served
for
he
was
a
doughty
drinker
and
was
already
past
the
time
for
supper
so
then
must
the
secretary
write
and
i
read
out
the
names
and
the
young
lady
draw
the
lots
while
her
parents
looked
on
and
how
it
all
happened
i
know
not
but
so
i
made
my
first
acquaintance
in
that
house
and
they
complaining
greatly
how
tedious
were
the
winter
nights
gave
me
to
understand
i
should
to
make
them
pass
more
easily
often
visit
them
of
evenings
for
otherwise
they
had
no
great
pastime
which
was
indeed
the
very
thing
i
had
of
long
time
desired
so
from
that
time
forward
though
for
a
while
i
must
be
on
my
good
behaviour
with
the
damsel
i
began
to
play
a
new
part
dancing
on
the
limed
twig
and
nibbling
at
the
fool
bait
till
both
the
maid
and
her
parents
must
needs
believe
i
had
swallowed
the
hook
though
as
yet
i
had
not
by
a
long
score
any
serious
intent
i
spent
all
my
day
in
arraying
myself
for
the
night
as
witches
use
to
do
and
the
morrow
in
poring
over
books
of
love
composing
from
them
amorous
letters
to
my
mistress
as
if
i
dwelt
a
hundred
leagues
off
or
saw
her
but
once
in
many
years
so
at
last
i
was
become
a
familiar
of
the
house
and
my
suit
not
frowned
upon
by
her
parents
nay
was
even
proposed
i
should
teach
the
daughter
to
play
the
lute
so
there
i
had
free
entrance
not
only
by
night
but
by
day
also
so
that
i
could
now
alter
my
tune
and
no
longer
sing
on
the
bat
back
do
i
fly
after
sunset
merrily
but
did
write
a
pretty
enough
ditty
in
the
which
i
lauded
my
good
fortune
which
had
granted
me
after
so
many
happy
evenings
so
many
joyous
days
also
wherein
i
could
feast
mine
eyes
on
the
charms
of
my
beloved
and
be
refreshed
thereby
yet
in
the
same
song
did
bemoan
my
hard
fate
that
made
my
nights
so
miserable
and
granted
me
not
that
i
should
spend
the
night
like
the
day
in
sweet
enjoyment
which
though
it
seemed
somewhat
bold
i
sang
to
my
love
with
adoring
sighs
and
an
enchanting
melody
wherein
the
lute
also
bore
its
part
and
with
me
besought
the
maid
that
she
would
lend
her
aid
to
make
my
nights
as
happy
as
my
days
to
all
which
i
had
but
a
cold
response
for
was
a
prudent
maid
and
could
at
will
give
me
a
fitting
answer
to
all
my
feigned
transports
though
i
might
devise
them
never
so
wisely
yet
was
i
shy
of
saying
aught
of
matrimony
and
if
such
were
touched
on
in
conversation
then
would
i
make
my
speech
brief
and
comprest
of
that
my
damsel
married
sister
took
note
and
therefore
barred
all
access
for
me
to
my
mistress
so
that
we
might
not
be
so
often
together
as
before
for
she
perceived
her
sister
was
deep
in
love
with
me
and
that
the
business
would
not
in
such
fashion
end
well
there
is
no
need
to
recount
all
the
follies
of
my
courtship
seeing
that
the
books
of
love
are
full
of
such
it
shall
suffice
for
the
gentle
reader
to
know
that
at
last
i
was
bold
to
kiss
my
mistress
and
thereafter
to
engage
in
other
dalliance
which
much
desired
advances
i
pursued
with
all
manner
of
incitements
till
at
length
i
was
admitted
by
her
at
night
and
laid
myself
by
her
side
as
naturally
as
if
i
were
her
own
and
here
as
every
man
knoweth
what
on
such
a
merry
tide
is
wont
to
happen
the
reader
may
well
suppose
that
i
dealt
dishonourably
with
the
maiden
but
no
for
all
my
purpose
was
defeated
and
i
found
such
resistance
as
i
had
never
thought
to
find
in
any
woman
for
her
intent
was
only
for
honourable
marriage
and
though
i
promised
all
that
and
with
the
most
solemn
oaths
yet
would
she
grant
me
nothing
before
wedlock
but
only
this
to
lie
by
her
and
there
at
length
quite
worn
out
with
disgust
i
fell
asleep
but
presently
thereafter
was
i
rudely
awoke
for
at
four
of
the
morning
there
stood
my
colonel
before
my
bed
a
pistol
in
one
hand
and
a
torch
in
the
other
and
croat
he
cries
to
his
servant
that
stood
by
him
also
with
a
drawn
sword
croat
go
fetch
the
parson
as
quick
as
may
be
but
i
awaking
and
seeing
in
what
danger
i
lay
alas
thought
i
make
thy
peace
with
god
before
this
man
make
an
end
of
thee
and
was
all
green
and
yellow
before
mine
eyes
and
i
knew
not
whether
i
should
open
them
or
not
thou
lewd
fellow
says
he
to
me
must
i
find
thee
thus
shaming
of
mine
house
should
i
do
thee
wrong
if
i
break
the
neck
of
thee
and
of
this
baggage
that
hath
been
thine
whore
ah
thou
beast
how
can
i
refrain
myself
that
i
tear
not
thy
heart
from
thy
body
and
hew
it
in
pieces
and
cast
it
for
the
dogs
to
eat
and
with
that
he
gnashed
with
his
teeth
and
rolled
his
eyes
like
a
wild
beast
i
knowing
not
what
to
say
and
my
bedfellow
able
to
do
naught
but
weep
yet
at
last
i
came
to
myself
somewhat
and
would
have
pleaded
our
innocence
but
he
bid
me
hold
my
peace
and
now
began
upon
fresh
matter
to
wit
how
he
had
trusted
me
as
a
very
different
man
and
how
i
had
repaid
his
trust
with
the
worst
treachery
in
the
world
and
thereafter
came
in
his
lady
wife
and
began
another
sermon
till
i
would
sooner
have
lain
in
a
hedge
of
thorns
nay
i
believe
she
had
not
stayed
her
speech
for
two
hours
or
more
had
not
the
croat
returned
with
the
parson
now
before
he
came
i
tried
once
or
twice
to
arise
but
the
colonel
with
a
fierce
aspect
bade
me
lie
still
and
so
i
was
taught
how
little
courage
a
fellow
hath
that
is
caught
on
an
ill
errand
and
how
it
fares
with
the
heart
of
a
thief
that
hath
broken
a
house
and
is
captured
yet
having
stolen
nothing
for
i
remember
the
good
old
days
when
if
such
a
colonel
and
two
such
croats
had
fallen
foul
of
me
i
had
made
shift
to
put
all
three
to
flight
but
now
there
i
lay
like
any
malingerer
and
had
not
the
heart
to
use
my
tongue
let
alone
my
fists
see
master
parson
quoth
my
colonel
the
fair
sight
to
which
i
must
perforce
invite
you
to
be
a
witness
of
my
shame
and
hardly
had
he
said
the
word
in
his
accustomed
tone
when
he
began
again
to
yell
hundred
devils
and
thousand
curses
till
i
could
understand
nothing
of
what
he
said
save
of
breaking
of
necks
and
washing
of
hands
in
blood
for
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
like
a
wild
boar
and
demeaned
himself
as
if
in
truth
he
would
take
leave
of
his
senses
i
thinking
every
moment
now
will
he
send
a
ball
through
thy
head
yet
the
good
parson
did
his
best
to
hinder
him
from
any
rash
deed
whereof
he
might
repent
him
afterwards
for
how
now
master
colonel
says
he
how
now
give
your
own
sound
reason
room
to
act
and
bethink
you
of
the
old
saying
that
to
what
is
done
and
can
not
be
undone
it
behoves
to
give
the
handsomest
name
for
this
fine
young
couple
which
can
hardly
be
matched
in
the
land
be
not
the
first
nor
will
be
the
last
to
be
overcome
by
the
invincible
power
of
love
the
fault
which
they
have
committed
for
a
fault
we
must
needs
call
it
may
by
themselves
be
easily
repaired
i
can
not
indeed
approve
this
way
of
matching
yet
have
these
young
folks
deserved
neither
gallows
nor
wheel
nor
hath
the
herr
colonel
any
shame
to
expect
if
he
will
but
keep
secret
and
forgive
this
fault
which
otherwise
no
man
hath
knowledge
of
and
so
give
his
consent
to
their
marriage
and
allow
such
marriage
to
be
confirmed
by
public
ceremony
in
church
what
says
the
colonel
am
i
instead
of
punishing
them
to
come
to
them
cap
in
hand
and
make
them
my
compliments
sooner
would
i
when
the
day
comes
have
them
trussed
up
together
and
drowned
in
the
lippe
nay
ye
shall
wed
them
here
and
that
at
once
for
to
this
end
i
had
ye
fetcht
else
will
i
wring
the
necks
of
both
like
hens
but
as
to
me
my
thought
was
what
wilt
thou
do
wilt
thou
eat
thy
leek
or
die
at
least
is
such
a
maid
as
thou
needest
not
to
be
shamed
of
and
when
thou
thinkest
of
thine
own
lowly
descent
say
art
thou
worthy
to
sit
where
she
puts
off
her
shoes
yet
loud
and
long
i
swore
and
asseverated
we
had
wrought
no
dishonour
with
one
another
but
got
only
for
answer
we
should
have
so
behaved
that
none
could
suspect
evil
of
us
whereas
by
our
way
of
dealing
we
could
quiet
no
man
doubts
so
were
we
married
by
the
said
clergyman
sitting
up
in
bed
and
the
ceremony
over
were
forced
to
rise
and
to
leave
the
house
but
i
who
had
now
recovered
myself
and
felt
a
sword
by
my
side
must
crack
my
joke
and
says
i
i
know
not
why
ye
should
carry
yourself
thus
scurvily
when
other
young
folk
be
wedded
their
next
of
kin
do
bring
them
to
their
but
your
worship
after
my
wedding
doth
cast
me
forth
not
only
from
my
bed
but
from
the
house
and
in
place
of
such
congratulation
as
he
should
give
me
on
my
marriage
doth
grudge
me
even
the
sight
of
my
good
face
and
my
service
to
him
verily
if
this
fashion
hold
there
will
be
few
friendships
bred
by
weddings
in
this
world
how
simplicissimus
held
his
and
how
he
purposed
to
begin
his
new
life
the
people
at
my
lodging
were
all
astonished
when
i
brought
the
young
maid
home
with
me
and
yet
more
when
they
saw
how
unconcernedly
she
went
to
bed
with
me
for
though
this
trick
which
had
been
played
me
stirred
up
great
perplexity
in
my
mind
yet
was
i
not
so
foolish
as
to
put
my
bride
to
shame
and
so
even
while
i
had
my
dear
in
mine
arms
i
had
a
thousand
conceits
in
my
head
how
i
should
begin
and
end
my
behaviour
in
this
matter
now
thought
i
thou
art
rightly
served
and
yet
again
i
considered
that
i
had
met
with
the
greatest
disgrace
in
the
world
which
i
could
not
in
honour
pass
over
without
due
revenge
but
when
i
remembered
me
that
such
revenge
must
harm
my
and
also
my
gentle
and
innocent
bride
then
all
my
plans
were
naught
at
one
time
i
was
so
sore
ashamed
that
i
planned
to
shut
myself
up
and
let
no
man
see
me
again
and
again
i
reflected
that
that
would
be
to
commit
the
chief
and
greatest
folly
at
the
last
i
concluded
that
i
would
before
all
things
win
my
friendship
again
and
would
so
carry
myself
to
all
others
as
if
nothing
had
happened
untoward
and
as
if
i
had
made
all
things
ready
for
my
wedding
for
said
i
to
myself
seeing
that
this
business
hath
had
a
strange
beginning
thou
must
give
it
a
like
end
for
should
folk
know
thou
wast
trapped
in
thy
marriage
and
wedded
like
a
poor
maiden
to
a
rich
old
cripple
mockery
only
will
be
thy
portion
being
full
of
such
thoughts
i
rose
betimes
though
i
had
rather
have
lain
longer
and
first
of
all
i
sent
to
my
who
had
married
my
wife
sister
and
told
him
in
a
word
how
near
akin
to
him
i
now
was
and
besought
him
to
suffer
his
good
wife
to
come
and
help
to
prepare
somewhat
wherewith
i
might
entertain
people
at
my
wedding
and
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
plead
with
our
father
and
on
my
behalf
i
would
in
the
meantime
busy
myself
to
invite
such
guests
as
would
promote
a
peace
between
me
and
him
the
which
he
took
upon
him
to
do
and
i
betook
myself
to
the
commandant
to
whom
i
told
in
merry
fashion
how
quaint
a
device
my
and
i
had
hatched
for
making
up
of
a
match
which
device
was
so
swift
of
operation
that
i
had
in
a
single
hour
accomplished
the
betrothal
the
wedding
and
the
bedding
but
inasmuch
as
my
had
grudged
me
the
morning
draught
i
was
minded
instead
thereof
to
bid
certain
honourable
guests
to
the
to
which
also
i
respectfully
begged
to
invite
himself
the
commandant
was
fit
to
burst
with
laughter
at
my
comical
story
and
because
i
saw
him
in
merry
mood
i
made
yet
more
free
giving
as
my
excuse
that
i
could
not
well
be
reasonable
at
such
a
time
seeing
that
bridegrooms
for
full
four
weeks
before
and
after
their
wedding
were
never
in
their
sober
senses
but
whereas
they
could
play
the
fool
without
attracting
note
and
in
their
four
weeks
by
degrees
return
to
their
senses
i
had
had
the
whole
business
of
matrimony
thrust
upon
me
in
a
wink
and
so
must
play
my
tricks
all
at
once
so
as
thereafter
to
enact
the
sober
married
man
more
reasonably
then
he
demanded
me
what
of
the
dowry
and
how
much
of
the
rhino
my
had
given
for
the
for
of
that
said
he
the
old
curmudgeon
had
plenty
so
i
answered
him
that
our
marriage
settlement
consisted
but
in
one
clause
that
his
daughter
and
i
should
never
come
in
his
sight
again
but
forasmuch
as
there
was
neither
notary
nor
witness
present
i
hoped
the
clause
might
be
revoked
and
that
the
more
so
because
all
marriages
should
tend
to
the
furthering
of
good
fellowship
so
with
such
merry
quips
which
no
one
at
such
a
time
would
have
looked
for
from
me
i
obtained
that
the
commandant
and
my
whom
he
undertook
to
persuade
would
appear
at
my
he
sent
likewise
a
cask
of
wine
and
a
buck
to
my
kitchen
and
i
made
preparation
as
if
i
were
to
entertain
princes
and
indeed
brought
together
a
noble
company
which
did
not
only
make
merry
with
one
another
but
in
the
face
of
all
men
did
so
reconcile
my
father
and
with
me
that
they
gave
me
more
blessing
that
night
than
cursing
the
night
before
and
so
was
noised
all
over
the
town
that
our
wedding
had
been
of
intent
so
arranged
lest
any
folk
should
play
some
jest
upon
us
and
me
this
speedy
settlement
of
things
suited
full
well
for
had
i
come
to
be
married
with
my
banns
called
beforehand
as
is
the
usage
was
much
to
be
feared
there
would
have
been
some
baggages
that
would
have
given
a
world
of
trouble
by
way
of
hindrance
for
i
had
among
the
burghers
daughters
a
round
that
knew
me
only
too
well
the
next
day
my
treated
my
but
not
so
well
as
i
by
far
being
miserly
and
then
i
must
first
say
what
profession
i
was
minded
to
follow
and
how
i
would
maintain
my
household
wherein
i
was
first
aware
that
i
had
now
lost
my
noble
freedom
and
must
live
henceforth
under
orders
yet
i
carried
myself
obediently
and
was
beforehand
in
asking
my
dear
as
a
prudent
gentleman
for
his
advice
to
digest
and
to
follow
it
which
speech
the
commandant
approved
and
said
this
being
a
brisk
young
soldier
it
were
great
folly
that
in
the
present
wars
he
should
think
to
follow
any
but
the
soldier
trade
for
is
far
better
to
stable
one
horse
in
another
man
stall
than
to
feed
another
nag
in
own
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
promise
him
a
company
whenever
he
will
for
this
my
and
i
returned
thanks
and
i
refused
no
more
but
shewed
the
commandant
the
merchant
receipt
which
had
my
treasure
in
keeping
at
cologne
and
this
said
i
i
must
first
fetch
away
before
i
take
service
with
the
swedes
for
should
they
learn
that
i
served
their
enemies
they
of
cologne
would
laugh
me
to
scorn
and
keep
my
treasure
which
is
not
of
such
a
kind
as
one
can
easily
find
by
the
roadside
this
they
approved
and
so
was
concluded
promised
and
resolved
between
us
three
i
should
within
a
few
days
betake
myself
to
cologne
possess
myself
of
my
treasure
and
so
return
to
the
fortress
and
there
take
command
of
my
company
furthermore
a
day
was
named
on
which
a
company
should
be
made
over
to
my
together
with
the
commission
of
in
the
commandant
regiment
for
count
götz
lying
in
westphalia
with
many
imperial
troops
and
his
headquarters
at
dortmund
my
commandant
looked
to
be
besieged
next
spring
and
so
was
seeking
to
enlist
good
soldiers
yet
was
this
care
of
his
in
vain
for
the
said
count
götz
was
by
reason
of
the
defeat
of
john
de
werth
in
the
breisgau
forced
to
leave
westphalia
that
same
spring
and
take
the
field
against
the
duke
of
weimar
on
the
rhine
how
simplicissimus
came
to
a
certain
town
which
he
nameth
for
convenience
cologne
to
fetch
his
treasure
things
do
happen
in
different
fashions
to
one
man
ill
luck
cometh
by
degrees
and
slowly
another
it
doth
fall
upon
in
a
heap
so
hardly
had
i
spent
a
week
in
the
wedded
state
with
my
dear
wife
when
i
took
leave
of
her
and
her
friends
in
my
huntsman
dress
with
my
gun
upon
my
shoulder
and
because
all
the
roads
were
well
known
to
me
i
came
luckily
to
my
journey
end
without
danger
threatening
nay
i
was
seen
of
no
man
till
i
came
to
the
turnpike
in
deutz
that
lieth
opposite
cologne
on
this
side
the
rhine
but
i
saw
many
and
specially
a
peasant
in
the
land
of
berg
that
reminded
me
much
of
my
dad
in
the
spessart
and
his
son
was
still
more
like
the
old
simplicissimus
for
the
lad
was
herding
swine
as
i
was
passing
by
and
the
swine
scenting
me
began
to
grunt
and
the
lad
to
curse
thunder
and
lightning
strike
them
and
the
devil
fly
away
with
them
too
that
the
maidservant
heard
and
cried
to
the
lad
not
to
curse
or
she
would
tell
his
father
the
boy
answered
she
might
kiss
and
burn
her
mother
too
but
the
peasant
hearing
it
runs
out
of
the
house
with
a
whip
and
cries
out
wait
thou
anointed
rascal
i
will
teach
thee
to
curse
strike
thee
blind
and
the
devil
take
thy
carcase
and
with
that
he
caught
him
by
the
collar
whipped
him
like
a
dancing
bear
and
at
every
stroke
thou
wicked
boy
says
he
i
teach
thee
to
curse
devil
take
thee
i
kiss
for
thee
i
teach
thee
to
talk
of
burning
thy
mother
which
manner
of
correction
did
remind
me
naturally
of
me
and
my
dad
and
yet
had
i
not
such
decency
and
piety
as
to
thank
god
for
bringing
me
out
of
such
darkness
and
ignorance
and
into
greater
knowledge
and
understanding
and
how
then
could
i
expect
that
the
good
fortune
which
daily
rained
upon
me
should
endure
so
when
i
came
to
cologne
i
took
up
my
abode
with
my
jupiter
which
was
just
then
in
his
right
mind
but
when
i
told
him
wherefore
i
had
come
he
told
me
at
once
that
he
feared
i
should
but
thresh
straw
for
the
merchant
to
whom
i
had
given
my
money
to
keep
it
had
become
bankrupt
and
had
fled
is
true
my
property
had
been
officially
sealed
up
and
the
merchant
himself
cited
to
appear
but
was
greatly
doubted
if
he
would
return
because
he
had
taken
with
him
all
of
value
that
could
easily
be
carried
and
before
the
case
could
be
settled
much
water
might
flow
under
the
bridges
how
pleasing
this
news
was
to
me
any
man
can
easily
judge
i
swore
like
a
trooper
but
what
availed
that
i
did
not
get
my
property
back
so
and
had
no
hope
of
ever
doing
so
besides
i
had
taken
with
me
no
more
than
ten
thalers
for
the
journey
and
so
could
not
stay
so
long
as
the
matter
required
moreover
was
dangerous
for
me
to
tarry
there
for
i
had
reason
to
fear
that
as
now
being
attached
to
an
enemy
garrison
i
might
be
found
out
and
so
not
only
lose
my
goods
but
fall
into
a
still
worse
plight
yet
for
me
to
return
with
the
matter
unsettled
leave
my
property
wilfully
behind
and
have
naught
to
show
but
the
way
back
instead
of
the
way
thither
seemed
to
me
also
unwise
at
last
i
determined
i
would
stay
in
cologne
till
the
case
was
settled
and
let
my
wife
know
the
reason
of
my
delay
so
i
betook
myself
to
an
advocate
which
was
a
notary
and
told
him
my
case
begging
him
to
help
me
with
counsel
and
action
for
a
proper
reward
and
if
he
hastened
on
the
matter
i
would
make
him
a
good
present
besides
the
fixed
fees
and
as
he
hoped
to
get
plenty
out
of
me
he
received
me
willingly
and
undertook
to
board
and
lodge
me
and
thereupon
next
day
he
went
with
me
to
the
officers
whose
business
it
is
to
settle
bankrupts
affairs
and
handed
in
a
certified
copy
of
the
merchant
acknowledgment
and
produced
the
original
to
which
the
answer
was
we
must
be
patient
till
the
full
examination
of
the
matter
inasmuch
as
the
things
of
which
the
acknowledgment
spoke
were
not
all
to
be
found
so
now
i
prepared
myself
for
another
long
time
of
idleness
in
which
i
wished
to
see
somewhat
of
life
in
great
cities
my
host
was
as
i
have
said
a
notary
and
advocate
besides
which
he
had
half
a
dozen
lodgers
and
kept
always
eight
horses
in
his
stable
which
he
used
to
hire
out
to
travellers
moreover
he
had
both
a
german
and
an
italian
groom
that
could
be
used
either
for
driving
or
riding
and
also
tended
the
horses
so
that
with
this
threefold
or
rather
trade
he
not
only
earned
a
good
living
but
also
doubtless
put
by
a
good
deal
for
because
no
jews
be
allowed
in
that
town
he
found
it
easier
to
make
money
in
all
manner
of
ways
i
did
learn
much
in
the
time
i
was
with
him
and
especially
to
know
all
sicknesses
of
all
men
which
is
the
chiefest
art
of
the
doctor
of
medicine
for
they
say
if
the
doctor
do
but
know
the
disease
then
is
the
patient
already
half
cured
now
was
my
host
that
furnished
the
reason
why
i
understood
this
science
for
i
began
with
him
and
thereafter
to
examine
the
condition
of
other
persons
and
many
a
one
i
knew
to
be
sick
to
death
that
knew
not
of
his
own
sickness
at
all
and
that
was
held
by
his
neighbours
yea
and
by
the
doctors
too
to
be
a
hale
and
hearty
man
so
did
i
find
people
that
were
sick
with
evil
temper
and
when
this
disease
attacked
them
their
visages
were
changed
like
those
of
devils
they
roared
like
lions
scratched
like
cats
laid
about
them
like
bears
bit
like
dogs
and
to
shew
themselves
even
worse
than
savage
animals
they
would
throw
about
everything
that
they
could
get
into
their
hands
like
madmen
is
said
this
disease
ariseth
from
the
gall
but
i
do
rather
believe
its
origin
is
in
this
that
a
fool
hath
a
fool
pride
so
if
thou
hear
an
angry
man
rage
especially
about
a
small
matter
be
thou
bold
to
believe
that
man
hath
more
pride
than
sense
from
this
disease
followeth
endless
mischance
both
for
the
patient
and
for
others
for
the
patient
palsy
gout
and
early
death
and
perhaps
an
eternal
death
also
yet
can
we
with
a
good
conscience
refuse
to
call
such
men
patients
be
they
never
so
dangerously
ill
for
patience
is
what
they
most
do
lack
some
too
i
saw
quite
sick
with
envy
of
whom
is
said
that
they
eat
their
own
hearts
out
because
they
do
ever
walk
so
pale
and
sad
and
this
disease
do
i
hold
to
be
the
most
dangerous
as
coming
directly
from
the
devil
himself
though
yet
it
spring
from
mere
good
fortune
which
the
sick
man
enemy
doth
enjoy
and
he
that
can
quite
cure
such
an
one
may
wellnigh
boast
that
he
hath
converted
a
lost
sinner
to
the
christian
belief
for
this
disease
can
infect
no
true
christians
which
have
a
jealousy
only
of
sin
and
vice
the
gaming
passion
i
hold
likewise
for
a
disease
not
only
because
the
name
doth
imply
as
much
but
specially
because
they
that
are
infected
therewith
are
mad
after
the
thing
as
if
poisoned
it
hath
its
rise
from
idleness
and
not
from
greed
as
some
do
judge
and
if
thou
take
away
from
a
man
the
chances
of
lust
and
idleness
that
sickness
will
of
itself
depart
likewise
i
found
that
gluttony
is
a
disease
and
that
it
cometh
from
habit
and
not
from
overmuch
wealth
poverty
is
indeed
a
good
protective
against
it
but
not
thereby
cured
for
i
saw
beggars
that
revelled
and
rich
misers
that
starved
it
doth
bring
its
own
remedy
on
its
back
with
it
and
that
is
called
want
if
not
of
money
yet
of
bodily
health
so
much
so
that
these
patients
commonly
must
of
themselves
be
healed
when
it
comes
to
this
that
either
from
poverty
or
from
disease
they
can
devour
no
more
as
to
pride
i
took
it
for
a
kind
of
madness
having
its
rise
in
ignorance
for
if
a
man
do
but
know
himself
and
remember
whence
he
is
and
whither
he
goeth
is
clean
impossible
that
he
can
go
on
in
his
foolish
pride
when
i
do
see
a
peacock
or
a
strut
and
gobble
i
must
needs
laugh
like
a
fool
that
these
unreasoning
beasts
can
so
cleverly
mock
at
poor
man
in
this
his
great
malady
yet
have
i
never
been
able
to
find
a
special
remedy
against
it
for
they
that
are
sick
of
it
are
without
humility
as
little
to
be
cured
as
other
madmen
yea
i
deemed
too
that
immoderate
laughter
must
be
a
disease
for
philemon
died
of
it
and
democritus
was
till
his
end
sick
of
it
and
so
nowadays
do
our
women
say
they
could
laugh
till
they
died
is
said
it
hath
its
origin
in
the
liver
but
i
do
believe
it
cometh
from
immoderate
folly
for
much
laughter
is
no
sign
of
a
reasonable
man
nor
is
it
needful
to
present
a
remedy
for
it
since
is
not
only
a
merry
madness
but
often
doth
leave
a
man
before
he
can
well
enjoy
it
nor
less
did
i
remark
how
curiosity
is
but
a
disease
and
one
born
in
the
female
sex
is
little
to
outside
view
yet
in
truth
most
dangerous
seeing
that
we
all
must
pay
for
our
first
mother
curiosity
of
the
rest
as
sloth
revenge
jealousy
presumption
the
passions
of
love
and
the
like
i
will
for
this
turn
say
naught
since
was
never
my
intent
to
write
of
such
but
will
return
to
mine
host
which
indeed
gave
me
the
hint
to
reflect
upon
failings
seeing
that
he
himself
was
utterly
ruled
and
possessed
by
greed
how
the
huntsman
caught
a
hare
in
the
middle
of
a
town
the
fellow
had
as
i
have
said
all
manner
of
trades
by
which
he
scraped
together
money
he
fed
with
his
guests
and
not
his
guests
with
him
and
he
could
have
plentifully
fed
all
his
household
with
the
money
they
brought
him
in
if
the
skinflint
had
so
used
it
but
he
fed
us
swabian
fashion
and
kept
a
mighty
deal
back
at
the
first
i
ate
not
with
his
guests
but
with
his
children
and
household
because
i
had
little
money
with
me
there
were
but
little
morsels
that
were
like
spanish
for
my
stomach
so
long
accustomed
to
the
hearty
westphalian
diet
no
single
good
joint
of
meat
did
we
ever
get
but
only
what
had
been
carried
away
a
week
before
from
the
students
table
pretty
well
hacked
at
by
them
and
now
by
reason
of
age
as
grey
as
methuselah
over
this
the
hostess
who
must
do
the
cooking
herself
for
he
would
pay
for
no
maid
to
help
her
poured
a
black
sour
kind
of
gravy
and
bedevilled
it
with
pepper
yet
though
the
bones
were
sucked
so
dry
that
one
could
have
made
chessmen
of
them
yet
were
they
not
yet
done
with
but
were
put
into
a
vessel
kept
for
the
purpose
and
when
our
miser
had
a
sufficient
quantity
they
must
be
chopped
up
fine
and
all
the
fat
that
remained
boiled
out
of
them
i
know
not
whether
this
was
used
for
seasoning
soup
or
greasing
shoes
but
on
of
which
there
happened
more
than
enough
and
which
were
all
religiously
observed
for
therein
was
our
host
full
of
scruples
we
had
the
run
of
our
teeth
on
stinking
herrings
salt
cod
rotten
stockfish
and
other
decayed
marine
creatures
for
he
bought
all
with
regard
to
cheapness
only
and
grudged
not
the
trouble
to
go
himself
to
the
and
to
pick
up
what
the
fishmongers
themselves
were
about
to
throw
away
our
bread
was
commonly
black
and
stale
our
drink
a
thin
sour
beer
which
wellnigh
burst
my
belly
and
yet
must
pass
as
fine
old
october
besides
all
this
i
learned
from
his
german
servant
that
in
yet
worse
for
then
the
bread
was
mouldy
the
meal
full
of
maggots
and
the
best
dishes
were
then
a
couple
of
radishes
at
dinner
and
a
handful
of
salad
at
supper
so
i
asked
him
why
did
he
stay
with
the
old
miser
he
answered
he
was
mostly
travelling
and
therefore
must
count
more
on
the
of
travellers
than
on
that
mouldy
old
jew
who
he
said
would
not
even
trust
his
wife
and
children
with
the
for
he
grudged
them
even
a
drop
of
wine
and
in
a
word
was
such
a
curmudgeon
that
his
like
would
be
hard
to
find
what
i
had
seen
up
till
now
said
he
was
nothing
if
i
did
but
stay
there
for
a
while
i
should
perceive
that
he
was
not
ashamed
to
skin
a
flea
for
its
fat
once
said
he
the
old
fellow
had
brought
home
six
pounds
of
tripe
or
chitterlings
and
put
it
in
his
larder
but
to
the
great
delight
of
his
children
the
grating
chanced
to
be
open
so
they
tied
a
tablespoon
to
a
stick
and
fished
all
the
chitterlings
out
which
they
then
ate
up
in
great
haste
and
gave
out
was
the
cat
had
done
it
that
the
old
would
not
believe
but
caught
the
cat
and
weighed
her
and
found
that
skin
hair
and
all
she
weighed
not
so
much
as
his
chitterlings
now
as
the
fellow
was
so
shameless
a
cheat
i
desired
no
longer
to
eat
at
his
private
table
but
at
that
of
the
students
however
much
it
might
cost
and
there
was
certainly
more
royal
fare
yet
it
availed
me
little
for
all
the
dishes
that
were
set
before
us
were
but
which
profited
our
host
in
two
ways
first
in
fuel
which
he
thus
saved
and
secondly
because
it
spoiled
our
appetite
yea
methought
he
counted
every
mouthful
we
ate
and
scratched
his
head
for
vexation
if
ever
we
made
a
good
meal
his
wine
too
was
well
watered
and
not
of
a
kind
to
aid
digestion
and
the
cheese
which
was
served
at
the
end
of
every
meal
was
hard
as
stone
and
the
dutch
butter
so
salt
that
none
could
eat
more
than
half
an
ounce
of
it
at
breakfast
as
for
the
fruit
it
had
to
be
carried
to
and
fro
till
it
was
ripe
and
fit
to
eat
and
if
any
of
us
grumbled
thereat
he
would
begin
a
terrible
abusing
of
his
wife
loud
enough
for
us
to
hear
but
secretly
gave
her
orders
to
go
on
in
the
same
old
way
once
on
a
time
one
of
his
clients
brought
him
a
hare
for
a
present
this
did
i
see
hang
in
his
larder
and
did
think
for
once
we
might
have
game
to
our
dinner
but
the
german
servant
said
to
me
we
need
not
lick
our
lips
over
that
for
his
master
had
so
contracted
with
the
boarders
that
he
need
not
serve
them
such
dainties
i
should
go
to
the
old
market
in
the
afternoon
and
there
see
if
the
thing
were
not
there
for
sale
so
i
cut
a
bit
out
of
the
hare
ear
and
as
we
sat
at
our
midday
meal
and
the
host
was
not
there
i
told
them
how
our
skinflint
had
a
hare
for
sale
of
which
i
was
minded
to
cheat
him
if
one
of
them
would
follow
me
for
so
should
we
not
only
have
some
pastime
but
would
get
the
hare
too
every
one
of
them
consented
for
they
had
long
desired
to
play
our
host
a
trick
of
which
he
could
not
complain
so
that
afternoon
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
place
which
i
had
learned
of
from
the
servant
where
our
host
was
wont
to
stand
if
he
gave
a
tradesman
aught
for
sale
to
watch
what
the
buyer
paid
lest
he
should
be
cheated
of
a
farthing
there
we
found
him
in
talk
with
some
of
the
nobles
now
i
had
engaged
a
fellow
to
go
to
the
higgler
that
should
sell
the
hare
and
to
say
friend
that
hare
is
mine
and
i
claim
it
as
stolen
property
last
night
was
snatched
out
of
my
window
and
if
thou
give
it
not
up
willingly
is
at
thy
risk
and
the
risk
of
the
costs
in
court
the
huckster
answered
he
must
first
inquire
of
the
matter
for
there
stood
the
gentleman
of
repute
that
had
given
him
the
hare
to
sell
and
he
could
surely
not
have
stolen
it
so
as
they
disputed
they
gathered
a
crowd
round
them
which
when
our
miser
was
ware
of
and
saw
which
way
the
cat
jumped
he
gave
a
wink
to
the
higgler
to
let
the
hare
go
for
by
reason
of
all
his
boarders
he
feared
yet
greater
shame
but
the
fellow
i
had
hired
contrived
very
cleverly
to
shew
every
one
present
the
piece
of
the
ear
and
to
fit
it
into
the
slit
so
that
all
said
he
was
right
and
voted
him
the
hare
meanwhile
i
drew
near
with
my
company
as
if
we
had
come
by
chance
and
stood
by
the
fellow
that
had
the
hare
and
began
to
bargain
with
him
and
when
we
were
agreed
i
presented
the
hare
to
mine
host
with
the
request
he
would
have
it
served
up
at
our
table
but
the
fellow
i
had
engaged
with
i
paid
instead
of
money
for
the
hare
the
price
of
a
couple
of
cans
of
beer
so
our
skinflint
must
accept
the
hare
though
with
no
good
will
and
dared
not
say
a
word
at
which
we
had
cause
enough
to
laugh
and
had
i
meant
to
stay
longer
in
his
house
i
would
have
shewn
him
a
few
more
such
tricks
book
iv
how
and
for
what
reason
the
huntsman
was
jockeyed
away
into
france
if
you
sharpen
a
razor
too
much
you
will
notch
the
edge
and
if
you
overbend
the
bow
at
last
break
the
trick
i
played
on
my
host
with
the
hare
was
not
enough
for
me
but
i
devised
others
to
punish
his
insatiable
greed
so
did
i
teach
the
boarders
to
water
the
salted
butter
and
so
to
get
rid
of
the
overplus
salt
yea
and
to
grate
the
hard
cheese
like
the
parmesans
and
moisten
it
with
wine
all
which
things
were
to
the
miser
like
stabs
in
his
heart
nay
by
my
conjuring
tricks
at
table
i
drew
the
water
out
of
the
wine
and
made
a
song
in
which
i
compared
the
skinflint
to
a
sow
from
which
there
was
no
good
to
be
looked
for
till
the
butcher
had
her
dead
upon
the
trestles
and
so
i
myself
furnished
the
reason
why
he
paid
me
and
that
well
with
the
trick
ye
shall
now
hear
for
was
not
my
business
to
play
such
pranks
in
his
house
the
two
young
nobles
that
were
his
boarders
received
a
letter
of
exchange
and
the
command
to
go
into
france
and
there
to
learn
the
language
just
at
a
time
when
our
host
german
groom
was
on
his
travels
and
elsewhere
and
to
the
italian
said
he
he
dared
not
trust
his
horses
to
him
to
take
into
france
for
he
knew
little
of
him
and
feared
he
might
forget
to
come
back
and
so
should
he
lose
his
horses
and
therefore
he
begged
of
me
to
do
him
the
greatest
service
in
the
world
and
to
accompany
those
two
noblemen
with
his
horses
as
far
as
paris
for
in
any
case
my
suit
could
not
be
argued
before
four
weeks
were
over
and
he
for
his
part
would
if
i
would
give
him
full
powers
so
faithfully
further
my
interests
as
if
i
were
there
in
person
present
the
young
noblemen
besought
me
also
to
the
same
end
and
mine
own
desire
to
see
france
counselled
me
thereto
for
now
could
i
do
this
without
special
expense
and
otherwise
must
spend
those
four
weeks
in
idleness
and
spend
money
too
so
i
took
to
the
road
with
my
two
noblemen
riding
as
their
postilion
and
on
the
way
there
happened
to
me
nothing
of
note
but
when
we
came
to
paris
and
there
put
up
at
the
house
of
our
host
correspondent
where
also
the
young
noblemen
had
their
letter
of
exchange
honoured
the
very
next
day
not
only
was
i
with
the
horses
arrested
but
a
fellow
that
gave
out
that
my
host
owed
him
a
sum
of
money
seized
upon
the
beasts
with
the
leave
of
the
commissary
of
the
quartier
and
sold
them
the
lord
only
doth
know
what
i
said
to
all
this
but
there
i
sat
like
a
graven
image
and
could
not
help
myself
far
less
devise
how
i
could
return
along
a
road
so
long
and
at
that
time
so
dangerous
the
two
noblemen
shewed
me
great
sympathy
and
therefore
honourably
gave
me
a
larger
gratification
nor
would
they
have
me
leave
them
before
i
should
find
either
a
good
master
or
a
good
opportunity
to
return
to
germany
so
they
hired
them
a
lodging
and
for
some
days
i
stayed
with
them
to
wait
upon
one
of
them
which
by
reason
of
the
long
journey
as
being
unused
thereto
was
indisposed
and
as
i
shewed
myself
so
polite
to
him
he
gave
to
me
all
the
clothing
he
put
off
for
he
would
be
clad
in
the
newest
mode
their
counsel
was
i
should
stay
a
couple
of
years
in
paris
and
learn
the
language
for
what
i
had
to
fetch
from
cologne
would
not
run
away
so
as
i
halted
between
two
opinions
and
knew
not
what
to
do
the
doctor
which
came
every
day
to
cure
my
sick
nobleman
heard
me
once
play
on
the
lute
and
sing
a
german
ditty
to
it
which
pleased
him
so
that
he
offered
me
a
good
salary
together
with
board
at
his
own
table
if
i
would
live
with
him
and
teach
his
two
sons
for
he
knew
better
than
i
how
my
affairs
stood
and
that
i
should
not
refuse
a
good
master
thus
were
we
soon
agreed
for
both
the
noblemen
furthered
the
business
all
they
could
and
greatly
recommended
me
yet
would
i
not
engage
myself
save
from
one
quarter
of
a
year
to
the
next
the
doctor
spoke
german
as
well
as
i
did
and
italian
like
his
mother
tongue
and
therefore
i
was
the
more
pleased
to
take
service
with
him
and
as
i
sat
at
my
last
meal
with
my
noblemen
he
was
there
too
and
there
all
manner
of
sad
fancies
came
into
my
head
for
i
thought
of
my
newly
wedded
wife
the
ensigncy
promised
me
and
my
treasure
at
cologne
all
which
i
let
myself
so
easily
be
persuaded
to
leave
and
as
we
came
to
speak
of
our
former
host
i
had
a
whim
and
said
i
over
the
table
who
knoweth
whether
perhaps
our
host
have
not
of
intention
trepanned
me
hither
that
he
may
claim
and
keep
my
property
at
cologne
the
doctor
answered
it
might
very
well
be
so
especial
if
he
deemed
me
a
fellow
of
no
family
nay
said
one
of
the
nobles
if
our
friend
was
sent
here
to
the
end
he
should
stay
here
was
done
because
he
so
plagued
the
host
on
account
of
his
avarice
nay
said
the
sick
man
i
believe
there
is
another
reason
for
as
i
stood
of
late
in
my
chamber
i
heard
the
host
talk
loud
with
his
italian
man
so
i
listened
to
hear
what
was
all
about
and
at
last
from
the
servant
broken
german
i
understood
that
the
huntsman
had
accused
him
to
the
man
wife
of
not
tending
the
horses
well
all
which
the
jealous
knave
by
reason
of
the
man
imperfect
speech
understood
wrongly
and
in
a
dishonourable
way
and
therefore
told
the
italian
he
need
but
wait
for
the
huntsman
should
presently
be
gone
since
then
too
he
had
looked
askance
upon
his
wife
and
grumbled
at
her
more
than
before
which
i
had
myself
remarked
in
the
fool
then
said
the
doctor
from
whatever
cause
done
i
am
content
that
matters
have
so
turned
out
that
he
must
remain
here
but
be
not
dismayed
i
will
at
the
first
good
opportunity
help
you
back
to
germany
only
write
ye
to
the
man
at
cologne
to
have
a
care
of
the
money
or
he
will
be
called
sharply
to
account
and
this
also
doth
raise
suspicion
in
me
that
is
a
plot
namely
that
he
that
gave
himself
out
for
the
creditor
is
a
very
good
friend
both
of
your
host
and
of
his
correspondent
here
and
i
do
believe
the
bond
on
which
he
seized
and
sold
the
horses
was
brought
here
by
yourself
how
simplicissimus
found
a
better
host
than
before
so
monsieur
canard
for
so
was
my
new
master
called
offered
to
help
me
in
word
and
deed
that
i
might
not
lose
my
property
at
cologne
for
he
saw
how
much
it
troubled
me
so
as
soon
as
he
had
me
to
his
house
he
begged
i
would
tell
him
exactly
how
my
affairs
stood
that
he
might
understand
and
so
devise
how
i
might
best
be
helped
thereupon
i
thought
avail
me
little
if
i
revealed
mine
own
poor
birth
and
so
gave
out
i
was
a
poor
german
nobleman
that
had
neither
father
nor
mother
but
only
some
kinsfolk
in
a
fortress
wherein
was
a
swedish
garrison
all
which
said
i
i
had
perforce
concealed
from
my
host
at
cologne
and
my
two
noblemen
as
being
all
of
the
emperor
party
that
they
might
not
confiscate
my
money
as
the
enemy
property
my
intention
it
was
said
i
to
write
to
the
commandant
of
the
said
fortress
in
whose
regiment
i
had
been
promised
an
ensigncy
and
not
only
inform
him
in
what
fashion
i
had
been
deluded
hither
but
also
to
beg
him
to
have
the
goodness
to
take
possession
of
my
property
and
in
the
meantime
until
i
could
find
opportunity
to
return
to
my
regiment
to
put
it
at
the
disposition
of
my
friends
this
plan
the
good
canard
thought
good
and
promised
me
to
forward
the
letters
to
their
proper
place
though
it
were
in
mexico
or
even
in
china
accordingly
i
prepared
letters
to
my
wife
to
my
and
to
the
colonel
s
aint
a
ndré
commandant
in
lippstadt
to
whom
i
addressed
the
whole
packet
and
enclosed
the
two
others
the
contents
were
that
i
would
present
myself
again
as
speedily
as
might
be
if
only
i
could
get
the
means
to
perform
so
long
a
journey
and
begged
both
my
and
the
colonel
to
do
their
best
to
endeavour
to
recover
my
property
by
military
process
before
the
grass
was
grown
over
it
and
gave
them
a
full
list
of
the
amounts
in
gold
silver
and
jewels
all
these
letters
i
drew
up
in
duplicate
and
one
copy
monsieur
canard
took
charge
of
the
other
copy
i
did
entrust
to
the
post
that
if
one
copy
should
go
astray
the
other
at
least
might
arrive
safely
so
now
was
i
at
ease
in
my
mind
again
and
was
the
more
able
to
teach
my
master
two
sons
which
were
brought
up
like
young
princes
for
because
monsieur
canard
was
rich
therefore
was
he
beyond
all
measure
proud
and
must
make
a
display
the
which
disease
he
had
taken
from
the
great
men
with
whom
he
daily
had
to
do
and
aped
their
ways
his
house
was
like
a
prince
court
of
which
it
wanted
nothing
save
that
none
ever
called
him
gracious
sir
and
his
conceit
was
so
great
that
he
would
treat
a
marquis
when
such
came
to
visit
him
as
no
better
than
himself
he
was
ready
to
help
poor
folk
and
would
take
no
small
fees
but
forgave
them
the
money
that
his
name
might
be
more
renowned
and
because
i
was
ever
desirous
of
knowledge
and
because
i
knew
that
he
made
much
show
of
my
person
when
i
followed
him
with
his
other
servants
on
a
visit
to
some
great
man
i
would
help
him
in
his
laboratory
in
the
preparation
of
his
medicines
thus
was
i
become
well
acquainted
with
him
and
that
the
more
because
it
ever
pleased
him
to
speak
the
german
tongue
so
once
on
a
time
i
said
to
him
why
did
he
not
write
himself
down
as
of
his
nobleman
residence
which
he
had
newly
bought
near
paris
for
crowns
and
why
he
would
make
simple
doctors
of
his
sons
and
would
have
them
to
study
so
hard
were
it
not
better
since
he
himself
had
a
title
of
nobility
to
buy
them
offices
as
did
other
chevaliers
and
so
bring
them
entirely
into
the
class
of
nobles
nay
he
answered
if
i
visit
a
prince
to
me
is
said
doctor
be
seated
but
to
a
nobleman
thy
turn
so
said
i
but
doth
the
doctor
not
know
that
a
physician
hath
three
faces
the
first
an
angel
when
the
sick
man
sees
him
first
the
second
god
own
when
he
can
help
the
sick
and
the
third
the
devil
own
when
a
man
is
healed
and
can
be
rid
of
him
and
so
this
honour
of
which
ye
speak
doth
but
last
so
long
as
the
sick
man
is
plagued
in
his
belly
but
when
is
over
and
the
grumbling
past
there
hath
the
honour
an
end
and
doctor
is
the
door
and
so
the
nobleman
hath
more
honour
in
standing
than
the
doctor
in
sitting
namely
because
he
waiteth
ever
on
his
own
prince
and
hath
the
honour
never
to
leave
his
side
did
ye
not
of
late
master
doctor
take
of
a
prince
excrement
into
your
mouth
to
try
the
taste
now
i
do
say
i
would
sooner
stand
and
wait
for
ten
years
than
meddle
with
another
man
dung
yea
even
though
i
was
bidden
to
be
seated
on
beds
of
roses
to
that
he
answered
that
i
need
not
to
have
done
but
did
it
willingly
that
the
prince
might
see
how
desperate
anxious
i
was
to
understand
his
condition
and
so
my
fee
might
be
greater
and
why
should
i
not
meddle
with
another
dirt
that
payeth
me
perhaps
a
hundred
pistoles
for
it
and
i
pay
him
naught
that
must
eat
filth
of
another
kind
at
my
bidding
ye
talk
of
the
thing
like
a
german
and
were
ye
not
a
german
i
had
said
ye
talk
like
a
fool
with
that
saying
i
was
content
for
i
saw
he
would
presently
be
angry
and
to
bring
him
again
into
a
good
humour
i
begged
him
he
would
forgive
my
simplicity
and
began
to
talk
of
pleasanter
matters
how
he
became
a
stage
player
and
got
himself
a
new
name
now
as
monsieur
canard
had
more
game
to
throw
away
than
many
have
to
eat
which
yet
have
their
own
preserves
and
thus
more
meat
was
sent
to
him
by
way
of
present
than
he
and
all
his
people
could
eat
so
had
he
also
daily
many
parasites
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
kept
open
house
and
once
on
a
time
there
visited
him
the
king
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
other
high
personages
for
whom
he
prepared
a
princely
collation
as
knowing
well
whom
he
needed
to
keep
as
his
friends
namely
those
that
were
ever
about
the
king
or
stood
well
with
him
and
to
shew
them
his
great
goodwill
and
give
them
every
pleasure
he
begged
that
i
would
to
honour
him
and
to
please
the
high
personages
present
let
them
hear
a
german
song
sung
to
the
lute
this
i
did
willingly
being
in
the
mood
for
commonly
musicians
be
whimsical
people
and
so
busied
myself
to
play
my
best
and
did
so
please
the
company
that
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
said
was
great
pity
i
could
not
speak
french
for
so
could
he
commend
me
greatly
to
the
king
and
queen
but
my
master
that
feared
lest
i
might
be
taken
from
his
service
answered
him
i
was
of
noble
birth
and
thought
not
to
sojourn
long
in
france
and
so
could
hardly
be
used
as
a
common
musician
thereupon
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
said
he
had
never
in
his
life
found
united
in
one
person
such
rare
beauty
so
fine
a
voice
and
such
admirable
skill
upon
the
lute
and
presently
said
he
a
comedy
was
to
be
played
before
the
king
at
the
louvre
and
could
he
but
have
my
services
he
hoped
to
get
great
honour
thereby
this
monsieur
canard
did
interpret
to
me
and
i
answered
if
they
would
but
tell
me
what
person
i
was
to
represent
and
what
manner
of
songs
i
was
to
sing
i
could
learn
both
tune
and
words
by
heart
and
sing
them
to
my
lute
even
if
they
were
in
the
french
tongue
for
perhaps
my
understanding
might
be
as
good
as
that
of
a
schoolboy
such
as
they
commonly
use
for
such
parts
though
these
must
first
learn
both
words
and
actions
by
heart
so
when
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
saw
me
so
willing
he
would
have
me
promise
to
come
to
him
next
day
in
the
louvre
to
try
if
i
was
fit
for
the
part
and
at
the
time
appointed
i
was
there
the
tunes
of
the
songs
i
had
to
sing
i
could
play
at
once
perfectly
upon
the
lute
for
i
had
the
notes
before
me
and
thereafter
i
received
the
french
words
to
learn
them
by
heart
and
likewise
to
pronounce
them
all
which
were
interpreted
for
me
in
german
that
i
might
use
the
actions
fitted
to
the
songs
all
this
was
easy
enough
to
me
and
i
was
ready
before
any
could
have
expected
it
and
that
so
perfectly
as
monsieur
canard
declared
that
out
of
a
hundred
that
heard
me
sing
would
have
sworn
i
was
a
born
frenchman
and
when
we
came
together
for
the
first
rehearsal
i
did
behave
myself
so
plaintively
with
my
songs
tunes
and
actions
that
all
believed
i
had
often
played
the
part
of
orpheus
which
i
must
then
represent
and
shew
myself
vexed
for
the
loss
of
my
eurydice
and
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
had
so
pleasant
a
day
as
that
on
which
our
comedy
was
played
monsieur
canard
gave
me
somewhat
to
make
my
voice
clearer
but
when
he
tried
to
improve
my
beauty
with
oleum
talci
and
to
powder
my
curly
hair
that
shone
so
black
he
found
he
did
but
spoil
all
so
now
was
i
crowned
with
a
wreath
of
laurel
and
clad
in
an
antique
robe
in
which
all
could
see
my
neck
the
upper
part
of
my
breast
my
arms
above
the
elbow
and
my
knees
all
bare
and
naked
about
it
was
wrapped
a
cloak
of
taffety
that
was
more
like
a
flag
than
a
cloak
and
in
this
attire
i
languished
over
my
eurydice
called
on
venus
for
help
in
a
pretty
song
and
at
last
led
off
my
bride
in
all
which
action
i
did
play
my
part
excellently
and
gazed
upon
my
love
with
sighs
and
speaking
eyes
but
when
i
had
lost
my
eurydice
then
did
i
put
on
a
dress
of
black
throughout
made
like
the
other
from
out
of
which
my
white
skin
shone
like
snow
in
this
did
i
lament
my
lost
wife
and
did
conjure
up
the
case
so
piteously
that
in
the
midst
of
my
sad
tunes
and
melodies
the
tears
would
burst
forth
and
my
weeping
choked
the
passage
of
my
song
yet
did
i
play
my
part
right
well
till
i
came
before
pluto
and
proserpina
in
hell
to
them
i
represented
in
a
most
moving
song
their
own
love
that
they
bore
to
each
other
and
begged
them
to
judge
thereby
with
what
great
grief
i
and
my
eurydice
must
have
parted
and
prayed
with
the
most
piteous
actions
and
all
the
time
i
sang
to
my
lute
they
would
give
her
leave
to
return
to
me
and
when
they
had
said
me
yes
i
took
my
leave
with
a
joyful
song
to
them
and
was
clever
enough
so
to
change
my
face
my
actions
and
my
voice
to
a
joyful
tune
that
all
that
saw
me
were
astonished
but
when
i
again
lost
my
eurydice
all
unexpectedly
i
did
fancy
to
myself
the
greatest
danger
wherein
a
man
could
find
himself
and
thereupon
became
so
pale
as
if
i
would
faint
away
for
inasmuch
as
i
was
then
alone
upon
the
stage
and
all
spectators
looked
on
me
i
played
my
part
the
more
carefully
and
got
therefrom
the
praise
of
having
acted
the
best
thereafter
i
set
me
on
a
rock
and
began
to
deplore
the
loss
of
my
bride
with
piteous
words
and
a
most
mournful
melody
and
to
summon
all
creatures
to
weep
with
me
upon
that
all
manner
of
wild
beasts
and
tame
mountains
trees
and
the
like
flocked
round
me
so
that
in
truth
it
seemed
as
if
all
so
done
in
unnatural
fashion
by
enchantment
nor
did
i
make
any
mistake
at
all
till
the
end
but
then
when
i
had
renounced
the
company
of
all
women
had
been
murdered
by
the
bacchantes
and
cast
into
the
water
which
had
been
so
prepared
that
one
could
see
only
my
head
for
the
rest
of
my
body
was
beneath
the
stage
in
perfect
safety
where
the
dragon
was
to
devour
me
and
the
fellow
that
was
inside
the
dragon
to
work
it
could
not
see
my
head
and
so
did
let
the
dragon
head
wag
about
close
to
mine
this
seemed
to
me
so
laughable
that
i
could
not
choose
but
make
a
wry
face
which
the
ladies
that
looked
hard
upon
me
failed
not
to
perceive
from
this
comedy
i
earned
besides
the
high
praise
that
all
gave
me
not
only
an
excellent
reward
but
i
got
me
yet
another
nickname
for
thenceforth
the
french
would
call
me
naught
but
beau
alman
and
as
then
many
such
plays
and
ballets
were
represented
in
all
which
i
was
employed
but
at
last
i
found
i
was
envied
by
others
because
i
mightily
attracted
the
spectators
and
in
especial
the
women
to
turn
their
eyes
on
me
so
i
made
an
end
of
it
and
that
particularly
because
i
received
much
offence
on
one
occasion
when
as
i
fought
with
achelous
for
dejanira
as
hercules
and
almost
naked
i
was
so
grossly
treated
as
is
not
usual
in
a
by
this
means
i
became
known
to
many
high
personages
and
it
seemed
as
if
fortune
would
again
shine
upon
me
for
was
even
offered
me
to
enter
the
king
service
of
which
many
a
great
jack
hath
not
the
chance
yet
i
refused
but
much
time
i
spent
with
ladies
of
quality
that
would
have
me
sing
and
play
to
them
for
both
my
person
and
my
playing
pleased
them
nor
will
i
deny
that
i
gave
myself
up
to
the
temptations
of
the
frenchwomen
that
entertained
me
secretly
and
rewarded
me
with
many
gifts
for
my
services
till
in
the
end
i
was
wearied
of
so
vile
and
shameful
a
trade
and
determined
so
to
play
the
fool
no
longer
the
fourth
and
fifth
chapters
of
the
original
edition
are
devoted
to
a
prolix
and
tedious
account
of
an
adventure
if
adventure
it
may
be
called
of
the
kind
hinted
at
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
third
chapter
it
is
absolutely
without
connection
with
simplicissimus
career
as
an
actor
in
the
war
has
no
interest
as
a
picture
of
manners
and
finally
can
be
read
much
better
in
bandello
from
whose
much
livelier
story
vol
novel
of
the
complete
editions
it
is
copied
it
is
therefore
omitted
here
how
simplicissimus
departed
secretly
and
how
he
believed
he
had
the
neapolitan
disease
by
this
my
occupation
i
gathered
together
so
many
gratifications
both
in
money
and
in
things
of
worth
that
i
was
troubled
for
their
safety
and
i
wondered
no
longer
that
women
do
betake
themselves
to
the
stews
and
do
make
a
trade
of
this
same
beastly
and
lewd
pursuit
since
it
is
so
profitable
but
now
i
did
begin
to
take
this
matter
to
heart
not
indeed
for
any
fear
of
god
or
prick
of
conscience
but
because
i
dreaded
that
i
might
be
caught
in
some
such
trick
and
paid
according
to
my
deserts
so
now
i
planned
to
come
back
to
germany
and
that
the
more
so
because
the
commandant
at
lippstadt
had
written
to
me
he
had
caught
certain
merchants
of
cologne
whom
he
would
not
let
go
out
of
his
hands
till
my
goods
were
first
delivered
to
him
item
that
he
still
kept
for
me
the
ensigncy
he
had
promised
and
would
expect
me
to
take
it
up
before
the
spring
for
if
i
came
not
then
he
must
bestow
it
upon
another
and
with
his
letter
my
wife
sent
me
one
also
full
of
all
loving
assurances
of
her
hope
to
have
me
back
had
she
but
known
how
i
had
lived
she
had
surely
sent
me
a
greeting
of
another
sort
now
could
i
well
conceive
be
hard
to
have
my
congé
from
monsieur
canard
and
so
did
i
determine
to
depart
secretly
so
soon
as
i
could
find
opportunity
which
to
my
great
misfortune
i
found
for
as
i
met
on
a
time
certain
officers
of
the
duke
of
weimar
army
i
gave
them
to
understand
i
was
an
ensign
of
the
regiment
of
colonel
s
aint
a
ndré
and
had
been
a
long
time
in
paris
on
mine
own
affairs
yet
now
was
resolved
to
return
to
my
regiment
and
so
begged
they
would
take
me
as
their
on
their
journey
back
so
they
told
me
the
day
of
their
departure
and
were
right
willing
to
take
me
with
them
thereupon
i
bought
me
a
nag
and
made
my
provision
for
the
journey
as
secretly
as
i
could
got
together
my
money
which
was
in
all
some
doubloons
all
which
i
had
earned
from
those
shameless
women
and
without
asking
leave
of
monsieur
canard
went
off
with
them
yet
did
i
write
to
him
and
did
date
the
letter
from
maestricht
so
as
he
might
think
i
was
gone
to
cologne
in
this
i
took
leave
of
him
with
the
excuse
that
i
could
stay
no
longer
when
my
business
at
home
required
my
presence
but
two
nights
out
from
paris
was
with
me
as
with
one
that
hath
the
erysipelas
and
my
head
did
so
ache
that
next
morning
i
could
not
rise
and
that
in
a
poor
village
where
i
could
have
no
doctor
and
what
was
worse
none
to
wait
upon
me
for
the
officers
rode
on
their
way
next
morning
and
left
me
there
sick
to
death
as
one
that
concerned
them
not
yet
did
they
commend
me
and
my
horse
to
the
host
at
their
departure
and
left
a
message
for
the
mayor
of
the
place
that
he
should
have
respect
to
me
as
an
officer
that
served
the
king
so
there
i
lay
for
a
couple
of
days
and
knew
naught
of
myself
but
babbled
like
a
fool
then
they
fetched
the
priest
to
me
but
he
could
get
nothing
reasonable
from
me
and
since
he
saw
he
could
not
heal
my
soul
he
thought
on
means
to
help
my
body
as
far
as
might
be
to
which
end
he
had
me
bled
and
a
sudorific
given
me
and
had
me
put
into
a
warm
bed
to
sweat
this
served
me
so
well
that
the
same
night
i
did
know
where
i
was
and
whence
i
had
come
and
that
i
was
sick
next
morning
came
the
said
priest
to
me
again
and
found
me
desperate
for
not
only
had
my
money
all
been
stolen
but
i
did
believe
i
had
saving
your
presence
the
french
disease
for
i
had
deserved
this
more
than
my
pistoles
and
i
was
spotted
over
my
whole
body
like
a
leopard
nor
could
i
either
walk
or
stand
or
sit
or
lie
and
now
was
my
patience
at
an
end
for
though
i
could
not
well
believe
was
god
had
given
me
the
gold
i
had
lost
yet
was
i
now
so
reckless
that
i
saw
was
the
devil
had
stolen
it
from
me
yea
and
i
behaved
as
if
i
were
quite
desperate
so
that
the
good
priest
had
much
ado
to
comfort
me
seeing
that
the
shoe
pinched
me
in
two
places
my
friend
says
he
behave
yourself
like
a
reasonable
man
even
if
ye
can
not
embrace
your
cross
like
a
good
christian
what
do
ye
will
ye
with
your
money
also
lose
your
life
and
what
is
more
your
hopes
of
eternal
salvation
so
i
answered
i
cared
not
for
the
money
if
i
could
but
be
rid
of
this
accursed
sickness
or
were
at
least
in
a
place
where
i
could
be
cured
ye
must
have
patience
answered
the
priest
as
must
the
poor
children
of
whom
there
lie
in
this
place
over
fifty
sick
of
this
disease
so
when
i
heard
that
children
also
were
sick
of
it
i
was
straightway
cheered
for
i
could
not
well
suppose
that
such
would
catch
that
filthy
disease
so
i
reached
for
my
valise
to
see
what
might
still
be
there
but
save
my
linen
there
was
naught
there
but
a
casket
with
a
lady
portrait
set
round
with
rubies
that
one
at
paris
had
presented
to
me
the
portrait
i
took
out
and
gave
the
rest
to
the
priest
with
the
request
he
would
turn
it
into
money
in
the
next
town
so
that
i
might
have
somewhat
to
live
upon
of
which
the
end
was
that
i
got
scarce
the
third
part
of
its
worth
and
since
that
lasted
not
long
my
nag
must
go
too
all
which
barely
kept
me
till
the
began
to
dry
and
i
to
get
better
how
simplicissimus
pondered
on
his
past
life
and
how
with
the
water
up
to
his
mouth
he
learned
to
swim
wherewithal
a
man
sinneth
therewith
is
he
wont
to
be
punished
this
smallpox
did
so
handle
me
that
thenceforward
i
needed
not
to
fear
the
women
i
got
such
holes
in
my
face
that
i
looked
like
a
whereon
they
have
threshed
peas
yea
i
became
so
foul
of
aspect
that
my
fine
curls
in
which
so
many
women
had
been
tangled
were
shamed
of
me
and
left
their
home
in
place
of
which
i
got
others
that
were
so
like
a
hog
bristles
that
i
must
needs
wear
a
wig
and
even
as
outwardly
no
beauty
remained
to
me
so
also
my
sweet
voice
departed
for
i
had
had
my
throat
full
of
sores
mine
eyes
that
heretofore
none
ever
found
to
lack
the
fire
of
love
enough
to
kindle
any
heart
were
now
as
red
and
watery
as
those
of
any
old
wife
of
eighty
years
that
hath
the
spleen
and
above
all
i
was
in
a
foreign
land
knew
neither
dog
nor
man
that
would
treat
me
fairly
was
ignorant
of
their
language
and
had
no
money
left
so
now
i
first
began
to
reflect
and
to
lament
the
noble
opportunities
which
had
aforetime
been
granted
to
me
for
the
furthering
of
my
fortunes
which
yet
i
had
so
wantonly
let
go
by
i
looked
back
and
marked
how
my
extraordinary
luck
in
war
and
my
had
been
naught
but
a
cause
and
preparation
for
my
ill
fortune
which
had
never
been
able
to
cast
me
so
far
down
had
it
not
by
a
false
countenance
first
raised
me
so
high
yea
i
found
that
the
good
things
that
had
happened
to
me
and
which
i
had
accounted
truly
good
had
been
truly
bad
and
had
brought
me
to
the
depth
of
misery
now
was
there
no
longer
a
hermit
to
deal
so
faithfully
with
me
no
colonel
ramsay
to
rescue
me
in
my
need
no
priest
to
give
me
good
advice
and
in
a
word
no
one
man
that
would
do
me
a
good
turn
but
when
my
money
was
gone
i
was
told
to
be
off
and
find
a
place
elsewhere
and
might
like
the
prodigal
son
be
glad
to
herd
with
the
swine
so
now
first
i
bethought
me
of
that
priest
good
advice
that
counselled
i
should
employ
my
youth
and
my
wealth
for
study
but
was
too
late
to
shut
the
now
that
the
horse
was
stolen
o
swift
and
miserable
change
four
weeks
ago
i
was
a
fellow
to
move
princes
to
wonder
to
charm
women
and
that
made
the
people
believe
me
a
masterpiece
of
nature
yea
an
angel
but
now
so
wretched
that
the
very
dogs
did
bark
at
me
i
bethought
me
a
thousand
times
what
i
must
do
for
the
host
turned
me
from
the
door
so
soon
as
i
could
pay
no
more
gladly
would
i
have
enlisted
but
no
recruiting
officer
would
take
me
as
a
soldier
for
i
looked
like
a
scarecrow
work
could
i
not
for
i
was
still
too
weak
and
besides
used
to
no
handicraft
nothing
did
comfort
me
more
than
that
was
now
summer
coming
and
i
could
at
a
pinch
lodge
behind
any
hedge
for
none
would
suffer
me
in
any
house
i
had
my
fine
apparel
still
that
i
had
had
made
for
my
journey
besides
a
valise
full
of
costly
linen
that
none
would
buy
from
me
as
fearing
i
might
saddle
him
also
with
the
disease
this
i
set
on
my
shoulder
my
sword
in
my
hand
and
the
road
under
my
feet
which
led
me
to
a
little
town
that
even
possessed
an
shop
into
this
i
went
and
bade
him
make
me
an
ointment
to
do
away
the
on
my
face
and
because
i
had
no
money
i
gave
him
a
fine
soft
shirt
for
he
was
not
so
nice
as
the
other
fools
that
would
take
no
clothes
of
me
for
i
thought
if
thou
art
but
rid
of
these
vile
spots
soon
better
thy
case
for
thee
yea
and
i
took
the
more
heart
because
the
apothecary
assured
me
that
in
a
week
one
would
see
little
except
the
deep
scars
that
the
sores
had
eaten
in
my
face
was
there
and
there
too
was
a
that
earned
much
money
in
return
for
which
he
was
always
ready
with
his
ribald
jests
for
the
crowd
o
fool
says
i
to
myself
why
dost
thou
not
also
set
up
such
a
trade
beest
thou
so
long
with
monsieur
canard
and
hast
not
learned
enough
to
deceive
a
simple
peasant
and
get
thy
victuals
then
must
thou
be
a
poor
creature
indeed
how
he
became
a
vagabond
quack
and
a
cheat
now
at
that
time
was
i
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
for
my
belly
was
not
to
be
appeased
and
yet
i
had
naught
in
my
poke
save
a
single
golden
ring
with
a
diamond
that
was
worth
some
twenty
crowns
this
i
sold
for
twelve
and
because
i
could
plainly
see
these
would
last
but
for
a
time
if
i
could
earn
nothing
besides
i
determined
to
turn
doctor
so
i
bought
me
the
materials
for
an
electuary
and
made
it
up
likewise
out
of
herbs
roots
butter
and
aromatic
oils
a
green
salve
for
all
wounds
wherewith
one
might
have
cured
a
galled
horse
also
out
of
calamine
gravel
emery
and
a
powder
to
make
the
teeth
white
furthermore
a
blue
tincture
out
of
lye
copper
sal
ammoniac
and
camphor
to
cure
scurvy
toothache
and
likewise
i
got
me
a
number
of
little
boxes
of
tin
and
wood
to
put
my
wares
in
and
to
make
a
reputable
show
i
had
me
a
bill
composed
and
printed
in
french
on
which
could
be
read
for
what
purpose
each
of
these
remedies
was
fitted
and
in
three
days
i
was
ended
with
my
task
and
had
scarce
spent
three
crowns
on
my
drugs
and
gallipots
when
i
left
the
town
so
i
packed
all
up
and
determined
to
walk
from
one
village
to
another
as
far
as
alsace
and
to
dispose
of
my
wares
on
the
way
and
thereafter
if
opportunity
offered
to
get
to
the
rhine
at
strassburg
to
betake
myself
with
the
traders
to
cologne
and
from
there
to
make
my
way
to
my
wife
which
design
was
good
but
the
plan
failed
altogether
now
the
first
time
i
took
my
stand
before
a
church
with
my
wares
and
offered
them
my
gain
was
small
indeed
for
i
was
far
too
shamefaced
and
neither
would
my
talk
nor
my
bragging
patter
run
well
and
from
that
i
saw
at
once
i
must
go
another
way
to
work
if
i
would
gain
money
so
i
went
with
my
trumpery
into
the
inn
and
at
dinner
i
learned
from
the
host
that
in
the
afternoon
all
manner
of
folk
would
come
together
under
the
before
his
house
and
there
he
said
i
might
sell
something
if
only
my
wares
were
good
but
there
were
so
many
rogues
in
the
land
that
people
were
mightily
chary
of
their
money
unless
they
had
real
proof
before
their
eyes
that
the
medicine
was
truly
good
so
when
i
found
where
the
shoe
pinched
i
got
me
a
full
of
strong
strassburg
branntwein
and
caught
a
kind
of
toad
called
reling
or
möhmlein
that
in
spring
and
summer
sits
in
dirty
pools
and
croaks
gold
colour
or
nearly
salmon
colour
with
black
spots
on
its
belly
most
hateful
to
see
such
an
one
i
put
in
a
wineglass
with
water
and
set
it
by
my
wares
on
a
table
under
the
and
when
the
people
began
to
gather
together
and
stood
round
me
some
thought
i
would
with
the
tongs
that
i
had
borrowed
from
the
hostess
pull
out
teeth
but
i
began
thus
my
masters
and
goot
frients
for
i
could
still
speak
but
little
french
i
be
no
only
i
haf
goot
watter
for
ze
eye
zat
make
all
ze
running
go
way
from
ze
red
eye
yea
says
one
that
can
one
see
by
thine
own
eyes
that
be
like
to
two
and
zat
is
true
says
i
but
if
i
had
not
ze
watter
sure
i
were
quite
blint
besides
i
sell
not
ze
watter
ze
elegtuary
and
ze
powder
for
ze
white
tooths
and
ze
zese
will
i
sell
but
ze
watter
i
gif
avay
mit
dem
for
i
be
no
quack
nor
no
cheater
i
do
sell
mine
elegtuary
and
when
i
haf
tried
it
if
it
blease
you
not
you
needs
not
to
puy
it
so
i
bade
one
of
them
that
stood
by
to
choose
any
one
of
my
boxes
of
electuary
out
of
which
i
made
a
pill
as
large
as
a
pea
and
put
it
into
my
branntwein
which
the
people
took
for
water
and
there
pounded
it
up
and
then
picked
up
the
toad
with
the
tongs
out
of
the
and
said
see
my
goot
frients
if
this
fenomous
worm
do
drink
mine
elegtuary
wizout
dying
so
is
ze
ting
no
goot
and
zenn
puy
it
not
with
that
i
put
the
poor
toad
that
had
been
born
in
water
and
could
bear
no
other
element
or
liquor
into
the
branntwein
and
held
it
covered
in
with
a
paper
so
that
he
could
not
leap
out
which
began
to
struggle
and
to
wriggle
yea
to
do
worse
than
if
i
had
thrown
him
upon
coals
for
the
branntwein
was
much
too
strong
for
him
and
after
a
short
time
he
died
and
stretched
out
his
four
legs
at
that
the
peasants
opened
their
mouths
and
their
purses
too
when
they
saw
so
plain
a
proof
with
their
own
eyes
for
now
they
believed
there
could
be
no
better
electuary
on
earth
than
mine
and
i
had
enough
to
do
to
wrap
up
the
stuff
in
the
printed
papers
and
take
money
for
it
for
some
of
them
did
buy
three
four
five
six
times
so
much
that
they
might
at
need
be
provided
with
so
sure
an
antidote
against
poison
yea
they
bought
also
for
their
friends
and
kinsfolk
that
dwelt
in
other
places
so
that
from
this
foolery
though
was
no
i
gained
by
the
evening
ten
crowns
and
still
kept
more
than
the
half
of
my
wares
the
same
night
i
betook
myself
to
another
village
as
fearing
lest
some
peasant
should
be
so
curious
as
to
put
a
toad
in
water
to
try
the
virtue
of
my
electuary
and
if
it
should
fail
my
back
should
suffer
for
it
but
to
shew
the
excellence
of
my
antidote
in
another
way
i
made
me
of
meal
saffron
and
galls
a
yellow
arsenic
and
of
meal
and
vitriol
a
sublimate
of
mercury
and
when
i
would
show
the
effect
of
it
i
had
ready
two
like
glasses
of
fresh
water
on
the
table
whereof
one
was
pretty
strongly
mixed
with
aqua
fortis
into
this
i
stirred
a
little
of
my
electuary
and
dropped
in
as
much
of
my
two
poisons
as
was
needed
then
was
one
water
that
had
no
electuary
but
also
no
aqua
fortis
in
it
as
black
as
ink
while
the
other
by
reason
of
the
aqua
fortis
remained
as
it
was
aha
said
they
all
see
that
is
truly
a
marvellous
electuary
for
so
little
money
and
then
when
i
poured
both
together
again
the
whole
was
clear
once
more
at
that
the
good
peasants
dragged
out
their
purses
and
bought
of
me
which
not
only
helped
my
hungry
belly
but
also
i
could
take
horse
again
earned
much
money
on
the
way
and
so
came
safely
to
the
german
border
and
so
my
dear
put
not
your
faith
in
quacks
or
ye
will
be
deceived
by
them
since
they
seek
not
your
health
but
your
wealth
how
the
doctor
was
fitted
with
a
musquet
under
captain
curmudgeon
now
as
i
passed
through
lorraine
my
wares
gave
out
and
because
i
must
avoid
i
had
no
chance
to
get
more
so
must
i
devise
another
plan
till
i
could
make
electuary
again
so
i
bought
me
two
measures
of
branntwein
and
coloured
it
with
saffron
and
sold
it
in
glasses
to
the
people
as
a
gold
water
of
great
price
good
against
fever
and
so
my
two
measures
brought
me
in
thirty
gulden
but
my
little
glasses
running
short
and
i
hearing
of
a
that
dwelt
in
the
county
of
fleckenstein
i
betook
myself
thither
to
equip
myself
afresh
but
seeking
for
was
by
chance
caught
by
a
picket
from
philippsburg
that
was
quartered
in
the
castle
of
wagelnburg
and
so
lost
all
that
i
had
wrung
out
of
the
people
by
my
cheats
on
the
journey
and
because
the
peasant
that
went
with
me
to
shew
the
way
told
the
fellows
i
was
a
doctor
as
a
doctor
i
must
be
taken
to
philippsburg
there
was
i
examined
and
spared
not
to
say
who
i
was
in
truth
which
they
believed
not
but
would
make
more
of
me
than
i
could
well
be
for
i
should
and
must
remain
a
doctor
then
must
i
swear
i
belonged
to
the
emperor
dragoons
in
soest
and
declare
on
my
oath
all
that
had
happened
to
me
from
then
to
now
and
what
i
now
intended
but
said
they
the
emperor
had
need
of
soldiers
as
much
at
philippsburg
as
at
soest
and
so
would
they
give
me
entertainment
till
i
had
good
opportunity
to
come
to
my
regiment
but
if
this
plan
was
not
to
my
taste
i
might
content
myself
to
remain
in
prison
and
be
treated
as
a
doctor
till
i
should
be
released
for
as
a
doctor
i
had
been
taken
so
i
came
down
from
a
horse
to
a
donkey
and
must
become
a
musqueteer
against
my
will
which
vexed
me
mightily
for
want
was
master
there
and
the
rations
terrible
small
i
say
not
to
no
purpose
terrible
for
i
was
terrified
every
morning
when
i
received
mine
for
i
knew
i
must
make
that
suffice
for
the
whole
day
which
i
could
have
made
away
with
at
a
meal
without
trouble
and
to
tell
truth
is
a
poor
creature
a
musqueteer
that
must
so
pass
his
life
in
a
garrison
and
make
dry
bread
suffice
him
yea
and
not
half
enough
of
that
for
he
is
naught
else
than
a
prisoner
that
prolongs
his
miserable
life
with
the
bread
and
water
of
tribulation
nay
a
prisoner
hath
the
better
lot
for
he
needs
neither
to
watch
nor
to
go
the
rounds
nor
stand
sentry
but
lies
at
rest
and
has
as
much
hope
as
any
such
poor
in
time
at
length
to
get
out
of
his
prison
is
true
there
were
some
that
bettered
their
condition
and
that
in
divers
ways
but
none
that
pleased
me
and
seemed
to
me
a
reputable
way
to
gain
my
food
for
some
in
this
miserable
plight
took
to
themselves
wives
yea
the
most
vile
women
at
need
for
no
other
cause
than
to
be
kept
by
the
said
work
either
with
sewing
washing
and
spinning
or
with
selling
of
old
clothes
and
higgling
or
even
with
stealing
there
was
a
among
the
women
that
drew
her
pay
as
a
corporal
another
was
a
midwife
and
so
earned
many
a
good
meal
for
herself
and
her
husband
another
could
starch
and
wash
others
laundered
for
the
unmarried
soldiers
and
officers
shirts
stockings
and
i
know
not
what
else
from
which
they
had
each
her
special
name
others
did
sell
tobacco
and
provide
pipes
for
the
fellows
that
had
need
of
them
others
dealt
in
branntwein
another
was
a
seamstress
and
could
do
all
manner
of
embroidery
and
cut
patterns
to
earn
money
another
gained
a
livelihood
from
the
fields
only
in
winter
she
gathered
snails
in
spring
in
summer
she
took
and
in
autumn
she
would
gather
fruit
of
all
kinds
a
few
carried
wood
for
sale
like
asses
and
others
traded
with
this
and
that
yet
to
gain
my
support
in
such
a
way
was
not
for
me
for
i
had
a
wife
already
other
fellows
did
gain
a
livelihood
by
play
for
at
that
they
were
better
than
sharpers
and
could
get
their
simple
comrades
money
from
them
with
false
dice
but
such
a
profession
i
loathed
others
toiled
like
beasts
of
burden
at
the
ramparts
but
for
that
i
was
too
lazy
and
some
knew
and
could
practise
a
trade
but
i
poor
creature
had
learned
none
such
is
true
if
any
had
had
need
of
a
musician
i
could
have
filled
the
place
well
but
that
land
of
hunger
was
content
with
drums
and
fifes
some
stood
sentry
for
others
and
night
and
day
came
never
off
duty
but
i
would
sooner
starve
than
so
torment
my
body
some
got
them
booty
by
expeditions
but
i
was
not
even
trusted
to
go
outside
the
gates
others
could
go
better
than
any
cat
but
such
a
trade
i
hated
worse
than
the
plague
in
a
word
wherever
i
turned
i
could
hit
on
no
way
to
fill
my
belly
yet
what
vexed
me
most
of
all
was
this
that
i
must
needs
endure
all
manner
of
gibes
when
my
comrades
said
what
thou
a
doctor
and
hast
no
art
but
to
starve
at
length
did
hunger
force
me
to
inveigle
a
few
fine
carp
out
of
the
town
ditch
up
to
me
on
the
wall
but
as
soon
as
the
colonel
was
ware
of
it
i
must
ride
the
for
it
and
was
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
to
exercise
that
art
further
at
the
last
others
misfortune
proved
my
good
luck
for
having
cured
a
few
patients
of
jaundice
and
two
of
fever
all
which
must
have
had
a
particular
belief
in
me
it
was
allowed
me
to
go
out
of
the
fortress
on
the
pretence
of
collecting
roots
and
herbs
for
my
medicines
instead
of
which
i
did
set
snares
for
hares
and
had
the
luck
to
catch
two
the
first
night
these
i
brought
to
the
colonel
and
so
got
not
only
a
thaler
as
a
present
but
also
leave
to
go
out
and
catch
hares
whensoever
i
was
not
on
duty
now
because
the
country
was
waste
and
no
man
there
to
catch
the
beasts
which
had
therefore
mightily
multiplied
there
came
grist
to
my
mill
again
insomuch
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
rained
hares
or
as
if
i
could
charm
them
into
my
snares
so
when
the
officers
saw
they
could
trust
me
i
was
allowed
to
go
out
on
plundering
parties
and
there
i
began
again
my
life
as
at
soest
save
that
i
might
no
longer
lead
and
command
such
parties
as
heretofore
in
westphalia
for
for
that
was
needful
to
know
all
highways
and
byways
and
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
rhine
stream
how
simplicissimus
endured
a
cheerless
bath
in
the
rhine
yet
must
i
tell
you
of
a
couple
of
adventures
before
i
say
how
i
was
again
freed
from
my
musquet
and
one
in
truth
of
great
danger
to
life
and
limb
the
other
only
of
danger
to
the
soul
wherein
i
did
obstinately
persist
for
i
will
conceal
my
vices
no
more
than
my
virtues
in
order
that
not
only
may
my
story
be
complete
but
also
that
the
untravelled
reader
may
learn
what
strange
blades
there
be
in
this
world
as
i
said
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
i
might
now
go
out
with
which
in
garrison
towns
is
not
granted
to
every
loose
customer
but
only
to
good
soldiers
so
once
on
a
time
nineteen
of
us
together
went
up
to
the
rhine
to
lie
in
wait
for
a
ship
of
basel
that
was
given
out
to
carry
secretly
officers
and
goods
of
the
duke
of
weimar
army
so
above
ottenheim
we
got
us
a
wherein
to
cross
over
and
post
ourselves
on
an
eyot
that
lay
handy
to
compel
all
ships
that
drew
near
to
come
to
land
to
which
end
ten
of
us
were
safely
ferried
over
by
the
fisherman
but
when
one
of
us
that
could
at
other
times
row
well
was
fetching
over
the
remaining
nine
of
whom
i
was
one
the
skiff
suddenly
capsized
and
in
a
twinkling
we
lay
together
in
the
rhine
i
cared
not
much
for
the
others
but
thought
of
myself
but
though
i
strained
to
the
utmost
and
used
all
the
arts
of
a
good
swimmer
yet
the
stream
played
with
me
as
with
a
ball
tossing
me
about
sometimes
over
sometimes
under
i
fought
so
manfully
that
i
often
came
up
to
get
breath
but
had
it
been
colder
i
had
never
been
able
to
hold
out
so
long
and
to
escape
with
my
life
often
did
i
try
to
win
to
the
bank
but
the
eddies
hindered
me
tossing
me
from
one
side
to
another
and
though
was
but
a
short
time
before
i
came
opposite
goldscheur
it
seemed
to
me
so
long
that
i
despaired
of
my
life
but
when
i
had
passed
that
village
and
had
made
sure
i
must
pass
under
the
strassburg
dead
or
alive
i
was
ware
of
a
great
tree
whose
branches
stretched
into
the
river
not
far
from
me
to
this
the
stream
flowed
straight
and
strong
for
which
cause
i
put
forth
all
the
strength
i
had
left
to
get
to
the
tree
wherein
i
was
most
lucky
so
that
by
the
help
both
of
the
water
and
my
own
pains
i
found
myself
astride
upon
the
biggest
branch
which
at
first
i
had
taken
for
a
tree
which
same
was
yet
so
beaten
by
waves
and
whirlpools
that
it
kept
bobbing
up
and
down
without
ceasing
and
so
shook
up
my
belly
that
i
wellnigh
spewed
up
lungs
and
liver
hardly
could
i
keep
my
hold
for
all
things
danced
strangely
before
my
eyes
and
fain
would
i
have
slipped
into
the
water
again
yet
found
i
was
not
man
enough
to
endure
even
the
hundredth
part
of
such
labour
as
i
had
so
far
accomplished
so
must
i
stick
there
and
hope
for
an
uncertain
deliverance
which
god
must
send
me
if
i
was
to
get
off
alive
but
in
this
respect
my
conscience
gave
me
but
cold
comfort
bidding
me
remember
that
i
had
so
wantonly
rejected
such
gracious
help
a
year
or
two
before
yet
did
i
hope
for
the
best
and
began
to
pray
as
piously
as
i
had
been
reared
in
a
cloister
determining
to
live
more
cleanly
in
future
yea
and
made
divers
vows
thus
did
i
renounce
the
soldier
life
and
forswore
plundering
for
ever
did
throw
my
and
knapsack
from
me
and
naught
would
suffice
me
but
to
become
a
hermit
again
and
do
penance
for
my
sins
and
be
thankful
to
god
mercy
for
my
deliverance
till
the
end
of
my
days
and
when
i
had
spent
two
or
three
hours
upon
the
branch
between
hope
and
fear
there
came
down
the
rhine
that
very
ship
for
which
i
was
to
help
lie
in
wait
so
i
lifted
up
my
voice
piteously
and
screamed
for
help
in
the
name
of
god
and
the
last
judgment
and
because
they
must
needs
pass
close
to
me
and
therefore
the
more
clearly
see
my
wretched
plight
all
in
the
ship
were
moved
to
pity
so
that
they
put
to
land
to
devise
how
best
to
help
me
and
because
by
reason
of
the
many
eddies
that
were
all
round
me
being
caused
by
the
roots
and
branches
of
the
tree
it
was
not
possible
to
swim
out
to
me
without
risk
of
life
nor
to
come
to
me
with
any
vessel
small
or
great
my
helping
needed
much
thought
and
how
i
fared
in
mind
meanwhile
is
easy
to
guess
at
last
they
sent
two
fellows
into
the
river
above
me
with
a
boat
that
let
a
rope
float
down
to
me
and
kept
one
end
of
it
themselves
the
other
end
i
with
great
trouble
did
secure
and
bound
it
round
my
body
as
well
as
i
could
so
that
i
was
drawn
up
by
it
into
the
boat
like
a
fish
on
a
line
and
so
brought
into
the
ship
so
now
when
i
had
in
this
fashion
escaped
death
i
had
done
well
to
fall
on
my
knees
on
the
bank
and
thank
god
goodness
for
my
deliverance
and
moreover
then
begin
to
amend
my
life
as
i
had
vowed
and
promised
in
my
deadly
need
but
far
from
it
for
when
they
asked
me
who
i
was
and
how
i
had
come
into
this
peril
i
began
so
to
lie
to
the
people
that
it
might
have
made
the
heavens
turn
black
for
i
thought
if
thou
sayst
thou
wast
minded
to
help
plunder
them
they
will
cast
thee
into
the
rhine
again
so
i
gave
myself
out
for
a
banished
organist
and
said
that
as
i
would
to
strassburg
to
seek
a
place
as
schoolmaster
or
the
like
on
the
upper
rhine
a
party
had
captured
me
and
stripped
me
and
thrown
me
into
the
rhine
which
brought
me
to
that
same
tree
and
as
i
contrived
to
trick
out
these
my
lies
finely
and
also
strengthened
them
with
oaths
i
was
believed
and
all
kindness
shewn
me
in
the
matter
of
food
and
drink
to
refresh
me
of
which
i
had
great
need
indeed
at
the
at
strassburg
most
did
land
and
i
with
them
giving
them
all
thanks
and
among
them
i
was
ware
of
a
young
merchant
whose
face
and
gait
and
actions
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
had
seen
him
before
yet
could
i
not
remember
where
but
perceived
by
his
speech
that
was
that
very
same
cornet
that
had
once
made
me
prisoner
and
now
could
i
not
conceive
how
from
so
fine
a
young
soldier
he
had
been
turned
into
a
merchant
specially
since
he
was
a
gentleman
born
yea
my
curiosity
to
know
if
my
eyes
and
ears
deceived
me
or
not
urged
me
to
go
to
him
and
say
monsieur
schönstein
is
it
you
or
not
to
which
he
answered
i
am
no
herr
von
schönstein
but
a
simple
trader
and
i
too
says
i
was
never
a
huntsman
of
soest
but
an
organist
or
rather
a
beggar
and
o
brother
he
answered
what
the
devil
trade
art
thou
of
whither
art
thou
bound
brother
said
i
if
thou
beest
chosen
by
heaven
to
help
preserve
my
life
as
hath
now
happened
for
the
second
time
then
is
certain
that
my
destiny
requires
that
i
should
not
be
far
from
thee
then
did
we
embrace
as
two
true
friends
that
had
aforetime
promised
to
love
one
another
to
the
death
i
must
to
his
quarters
and
tell
him
all
that
had
befallen
me
since
i
had
left
lippstadt
for
cologne
to
fetch
my
treasure
nor
did
i
conceal
from
him
how
i
had
intended
to
lay
wait
for
their
ship
with
a
party
and
how
we
had
fared
therein
and
he
on
his
part
confided
to
me
how
he
had
been
sent
by
the
hessian
general
staff
to
duke
bernhard
of
weimar
on
business
of
the
greatest
import
concerning
the
conduct
of
the
war
to
bring
reports
and
to
confer
with
him
on
future
plans
and
campaigns
all
which
he
had
accomplished
and
was
now
on
his
way
back
in
the
disguise
of
a
merchant
as
i
could
see
by
the
way
also
he
told
me
that
my
bride
at
his
departure
was
expecting
and
had
been
well
entreated
by
her
parents
and
kinsfolk
and
furthermore
that
the
colonel
still
kept
the
ensigncy
for
me
yet
he
jested
at
me
by
reason
of
my
face
and
would
have
it
that
neither
my
wife
nor
the
other
women
of
lippstadt
would
take
me
for
the
huntsman
so
we
agreed
i
should
lodge
with
him
and
on
this
opportunity
return
to
lippstadt
which
was
what
i
most
desired
and
because
i
had
naught
but
rags
upon
me
he
lent
me
some
trifle
in
money
wherewith
i
equipped
myself
like
to
an
but
as
is
said
what
will
be
must
be
that
i
now
found
true
for
as
we
sailed
down
the
river
and
the
ship
was
examined
at
rheinhausen
the
philippsburgers
knew
me
again
seized
me
and
carried
me
off
to
philippsburg
where
i
had
to
play
the
musqueteer
as
before
all
which
angered
my
friend
the
cornet
as
much
as
myself
for
now
must
we
separate
and
he
could
not
much
take
my
part
for
he
had
enough
to
do
to
get
through
himself
wherefore
clergymen
should
never
eat
hares
that
have
been
taken
in
a
snare
now
hath
the
gentle
reader
heard
in
what
danger
of
life
i
put
myself
but
as
concerns
the
danger
of
my
soul
is
to
be
understood
that
as
a
musqueteer
i
became
a
right
desperate
fellow
that
cared
naught
for
god
and
his
word
no
wickedness
was
for
me
too
great
and
all
the
goodnesses
and
loving
kindnesses
that
i
had
ever
received
from
god
quite
forgotten
and
so
i
cared
neither
for
this
world
nor
the
next
but
lived
like
a
beast
none
would
have
believed
that
i
had
been
brought
up
with
a
pious
hermit
seldom
i
went
to
church
and
never
to
confess
and
because
i
cared
so
little
for
my
own
soul
health
therefore
i
troubled
my
fellow
men
yet
more
where
i
could
cheat
a
man
i
failed
not
to
do
it
yea
i
prided
myself
upon
it
so
that
none
came
off
from
his
dealings
with
me
from
this
i
often
got
me
a
whipping
and
still
more
often
the
yea
i
was
often
threatened
with
the
strappado
and
the
gibbet
but
naught
availed
i
went
on
in
my
godless
career
till
it
seemed
i
would
play
the
desperado
and
run
to
hell
and
though
i
did
no
deed
evil
enough
to
forfeit
my
life
yet
was
i
so
reckless
that
save
for
sorcerers
and
sodomites
no
worse
man
could
be
found
of
this
our
regiment
chaplain
was
ware
and
being
a
right
zealous
saver
of
souls
at
eastertide
he
sent
for
me
to
know
why
i
had
not
been
at
confession
and
holy
communion
but
i
treated
his
many
faithful
warnings
as
i
had
done
those
of
the
good
pastor
at
lippstadt
so
that
the
good
man
could
make
naught
of
me
so
when
it
seemed
as
if
christ
and
his
baptism
were
lost
in
me
at
the
end
says
he
o
miserable
man
i
had
believed
that
thou
didst
err
through
ignorance
now
know
i
that
thou
goest
on
in
thy
sins
from
pure
wickedness
and
of
malice
aforethought
who
thinkest
thou
can
feel
compassion
for
thy
poor
soul
and
its
damnation
for
my
part
i
protest
before
god
and
the
world
that
i
am
free
of
guilt
as
to
that
damnation
for
i
have
done
and
would
have
gone
on
to
do
without
wearying
all
that
was
necessary
to
further
thy
salvation
but
henceforward
not
be
my
duty
to
do
more
than
to
provide
that
thy
body
when
thy
poor
soul
shall
leave
it
in
such
a
desperate
state
shall
be
conveyed
to
no
dedicated
place
there
to
be
buried
with
other
departed
pious
christians
but
to
the
with
the
carcases
of
dead
beasts
or
to
that
place
where
are
bestowed
other
and
desperate
men
yet
this
severe
threatening
bore
as
little
fruit
as
the
earlier
warnings
and
that
for
this
reason
only
that
i
was
shamed
to
confess
o
fool
that
i
was
for
often
i
would
tell
of
my
knaves
tricks
in
great
company
and
would
lie
to
make
them
seem
the
greater
yet
now
when
i
should
be
converted
and
confess
my
sins
to
a
single
man
and
him
standing
in
god
place
to
receive
absolution
then
was
i
as
a
stock
or
a
stone
i
say
the
truth
i
was
stockish
and
stockish
i
remained
for
i
answered
i
do
serve
the
emperor
as
a
soldier
and
if
i
die
as
a
soldier
be
no
wonder
if
i
like
other
soldiers
which
can
not
always
be
buried
in
holy
ground
but
must
be
content
to
lie
anywhere
on
the
field
in
ditches
or
in
the
maw
of
wolf
and
raven
must
make
shift
outside
the
churchyard
and
so
i
left
the
priest
which
for
his
holy
zeal
for
souls
had
no
more
return
from
me
than
that
once
i
refused
him
a
hare
which
he
urgently
begged
from
me
on
the
pretence
that
since
it
had
hanged
itself
in
a
noose
and
so
taken
its
own
life
therefore
as
a
it
might
not
be
buried
in
a
holy
place
how
simplicissimus
was
all
unexpectedly
quit
of
his
musquet
so
were
things
no
better
with
me
but
the
longer
the
worse
once
did
the
colonel
say
to
me
he
would
discharge
me
for
a
rogue
since
i
would
do
no
good
but
because
i
knew
he
meant
it
not
i
said
was
easy
enough
if
only
he
would
dismiss
the
hangman
too
to
bear
me
company
so
he
let
it
pass
for
well
could
he
conceive
that
i
should
hold
it
for
no
punishment
but
for
a
favour
if
he
would
let
me
go
and
against
my
will
i
must
remain
a
musqueteer
and
starve
till
the
summer
but
the
nearer
count
von
götz
came
with
his
army
the
nearer
came
also
my
deliverance
for
when
that
general
had
his
headquarters
at
bruchsal
my
friend
herzbruder
that
i
had
so
faithfully
helped
with
my
money
in
the
camp
before
magdeburg
was
sent
by
the
staff
on
certain
business
to
our
fortress
where
all
shewed
him
great
honour
i
was
even
then
sentry
before
the
colonel
quarters
and
though
he
wore
a
coat
of
black
velvet
yet
i
knew
him
at
first
sight
yet
had
not
the
heart
to
speak
to
him
at
once
as
fearing
lest
after
the
way
of
the
world
he
should
be
ashamed
of
me
or
would
not
know
me
for
by
his
clothes
he
was
now
of
high
rank
and
i
but
a
lousy
musqueteer
but
so
soon
as
i
was
relieved
i
asked
of
his
servants
his
name
and
rank
to
be
assured
that
i
did
not
address
another
in
his
place
and
yet
i
had
not
the
courage
to
speak
to
him
but
wrote
this
billet
to
him
and
caused
it
to
be
handed
to
him
in
the
morning
by
his
chamberlain
monsieur
if
it
should
please
my
worshipful
master
by
his
high
influence
to
deliver
one
whom
he
once
by
his
bravery
saved
from
bonds
and
fetters
on
the
field
of
wittstock
from
the
most
miserable
condition
in
the
world
into
which
he
hath
been
tossed
like
a
ball
by
unkind
fortune
cost
him
little
pains
and
he
would
for
ever
oblige
one
in
any
case
his
faithful
servant
but
now
the
most
wretched
and
deserted
of
s
simplicissimus
no
sooner
had
he
read
this
than
he
had
me
to
him
and
fellow
countryman
says
he
where
is
the
man
that
gave
thee
this
sir
i
answered
he
is
a
captive
in
this
fortress
well
says
he
now
go
to
him
and
say
i
would
deliver
him
an
he
had
the
halter
round
his
neck
sir
said
i
not
need
so
much
trouble
for
i
am
poor
simplicissimus
himself
come
not
only
to
give
thanks
for
his
rescue
at
wittstock
but
also
to
beg
to
be
freed
from
the
musquet
which
i
have
been
forced
against
my
will
to
carry
but
he
suffered
me
not
to
make
an
end
but
by
embracing
me
shewed
me
how
ready
he
was
to
help
me
in
a
word
he
did
all
that
one
faithful
friend
can
do
for
another
and
before
he
asked
me
how
i
came
into
the
fortress
and
to
such
a
service
he
sent
his
servant
to
the
jew
to
buy
me
a
horse
and
clothing
and
meanwhile
i
told
him
how
it
had
fared
with
me
since
his
father
had
died
before
magdeburg
and
when
he
heard
i
was
the
huntsman
of
soest
whose
many
famous
exploits
he
had
heard
of
he
lamented
that
he
had
not
known
such
before
for
so
could
he
well
have
helped
me
to
a
company
so
when
the
jew
came
with
a
whole
burden
of
soldiers
clothes
he
chose
out
the
best
for
me
bade
me
clothe
myself
and
so
took
me
with
him
to
the
colonel
and
to
him
sir
says
he
i
have
in
your
garrison
found
this
good
fellow
here
present
to
whom
i
am
so
much
bounden
that
i
can
not
leave
him
in
this
low
estate
even
if
his
good
qualities
deserved
no
better
and
therefore
i
beg
the
colonel
to
do
me
this
favour
and
either
to
give
him
a
better
place
or
to
allow
me
to
take
him
with
me
and
to
further
his
promotion
in
the
army
for
which
perhaps
the
colonel
has
no
great
opportunity
here
at
that
the
colonel
crossed
himself
for
sheer
wonder
to
hear
any
man
praise
me
and
says
he
your
honour
will
forgive
me
if
i
say
it
is
his
part
to
try
whether
i
am
willing
to
serve
him
so
far
as
his
deserts
do
require
and
so
far
as
that
goes
let
him
demand
aught
else
that
lies
in
my
power
and
he
shall
understand
my
willingness
by
my
actions
but
as
to
this
fellow
he
is
according
to
his
own
showing
no
soldier
of
mine
but
belongs
to
a
regiment
of
dragoons
and
is
besides
so
pestilent
a
companion
that
since
he
hath
been
here
he
hath
given
more
work
to
my
provost
than
a
whole
company
so
that
i
must
needs
believe
no
water
will
ever
drown
him
so
he
ended
with
a
laugh
and
wished
me
luck
but
for
herzbruder
this
was
not
enough
but
he
further
begged
the
colonel
not
to
refuse
to
invite
me
to
his
table
which
favour
he
also
obtained
and
this
he
did
to
the
end
that
he
might
tell
the
colonel
in
my
presence
what
he
only
knew
of
me
by
hearsay
in
westphalia
from
the
count
von
der
wahl
and
the
commandant
of
soest
all
which
actions
he
so
praised
that
all
must
hold
me
for
a
good
soldier
and
i
too
carried
myself
so
modestly
that
the
colonel
and
his
people
that
had
known
me
before
could
but
believe
that
with
my
new
clothes
i
had
become
a
new
man
moreover
when
the
colonel
would
know
how
i
had
gotten
the
name
of
doctor
i
told
them
the
whole
story
of
my
journey
from
paris
to
philippsburg
and
how
many
peasants
i
had
cheated
to
fill
my
belly
at
which
they
laughed
heartily
and
in
the
end
i
confessed
openly
it
had
been
my
intention
so
to
vex
and
weary
him
the
colonel
with
all
manner
of
tricks
that
he
must
at
last
turn
me
out
of
the
garrison
if
he
would
live
at
peace
from
all
the
complaints
that
i
caused
him
thereupon
he
told
of
many
rogueries
i
had
committed
while
in
the
garrison
for
example
how
i
had
boiled
up
beans
poured
grease
over
them
and
sold
the
whole
for
pure
grease
also
sand
for
salt
filling
the
sacks
with
sand
below
and
salt
above
and
again
how
i
had
made
a
fool
of
one
here
and
another
there
and
had
made
a
jest
of
every
man
so
that
during
the
whole
meal
they
spoke
only
of
me
yet
had
i
not
had
such
a
friend
at
court
these
same
acts
would
have
been
held
deserving
of
severe
punishment
and
so
i
drew
my
conclusion
how
go
at
court
if
a
rogue
should
gain
a
prince
favour
our
meal
ended
we
found
the
jew
had
no
horse
which
would
serve
herzbruder
for
me
but
as
he
stood
in
such
esteem
that
the
colonel
could
hardly
afford
to
lose
his
good
word
therefore
he
presented
us
with
one
from
his
own
stable
saddle
and
bridle
and
all
on
which
my
lord
simplicissimus
was
set
and
with
his
friend
herzbruder
rode
joyfully
forth
from
the
fortress
and
some
of
my
comrades
did
cry
good
luck
brother
good
luck
but
others
from
envy
the
longer
the
halter
the
greater
the
luck
discourses
of
the
order
of
the
marauder
brothers
now
on
the
way
herzbruder
agreed
with
me
that
i
should
give
myself
out
for
his
cousin
that
i
might
receive
greater
respect
and
he
for
his
part
would
get
me
a
horse
and
a
servant
and
send
me
to
the
regiment
of
neuneck
wherein
i
could
serve
as
a
volunteer
till
an
officer
place
should
fall
vacant
in
the
army
to
which
he
could
help
me
and
so
in
a
wink
i
became
a
fellow
that
looked
like
a
good
soldier
but
in
that
summer
i
did
no
great
deeds
save
that
i
helped
to
steal
a
few
cattle
here
and
there
in
the
black
forest
and
made
myself
well
acquainted
with
the
breisgau
and
alsace
for
the
rest
i
had
scant
luck
for
when
my
servant
and
his
horse
had
been
captured
by
the
weimar
troops
at
kenzingen
i
must
needs
work
the
other
harder
and
in
the
end
so
ride
him
to
death
that
i
was
fain
to
join
the
order
of
the
my
friend
herzbruder
indeed
would
willingly
have
equipped
me
again
but
seeing
that
i
had
so
soon
got
rid
of
the
first
two
horses
he
held
back
and
thought
to
let
me
kick
my
heels
till
i
had
learned
more
foresight
nor
did
i
desire
it
for
i
found
in
my
new
companions
so
pleasant
a
society
that
till
winter
quarters
should
come
i
wished
for
no
better
employ
now
must
i
tell
you
somewhat
of
these
merode
brothers
for
without
doubt
there
be
some
and
specially
those
that
be
ignorant
of
war
that
know
not
who
these
people
be
and
so
have
i
never
found
any
writer
that
hath
included
in
his
work
an
account
of
their
manners
customs
rights
and
privileges
besides
which
is
well
worth
while
that
not
only
the
generals
of
these
days
but
also
the
peasants
should
know
what
this
brotherhood
is
and
first
as
concerns
their
name
i
do
hope
be
no
disgrace
to
that
honourable
cavalier
in
whose
service
they
got
that
name
or
i
could
not
so
openly
tack
it
on
to
any
man
for
i
once
saw
a
kind
of
shoe
that
had
in
place
of
twisted
cords
that
a
man
might
more
easily
stamp
through
the
mud
and
these
were
called
mansfeld
shoes
because
his
troops
first
devised
them
yet
should
any
call
count
mansfeld
himself
cobbler
on
that
account
i
would
count
him
for
a
fool
and
so
must
you
understand
this
name
that
will
last
as
long
as
germans
do
make
war
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
it
when
this
gentleman
merode
first
brought
a
newly
raised
regiment
to
the
army
his
recruits
proved
as
weak
and
crazy
in
body
as
the
bretons
so
that
they
could
not
endure
the
marching
and
other
fatigues
to
which
a
soldier
must
submit
in
the
field
for
which
reason
their
brigade
soon
became
so
weak
that
it
could
hardly
protect
the
colours
and
wherever
you
found
one
or
more
sick
and
lame
in
the
or
in
houses
and
behind
fences
and
hedges
and
asked
of
what
regiment
the
answer
was
wellnigh
always
of
merode
hence
it
arose
that
at
length
all
that
whether
sick
or
sound
wounded
or
not
were
found
straggling
off
the
line
of
march
or
else
did
not
have
their
quarters
in
the
field
with
their
own
regiment
were
called
just
as
before
they
were
known
as
and
for
they
be
like
to
the
drones
in
the
beehives
which
when
they
have
lost
their
sting
can
work
no
more
nor
make
honey
but
only
eat
if
a
trooper
lose
his
horse
or
a
musqueteer
his
health
or
his
wife
and
child
fall
ill
and
must
stay
behind
at
once
you
have
a
pair
and
a
half
of
a
crew
that
can
be
compared
with
none
but
gipsies
for
not
only
do
they
straggle
round
the
army
in
front
in
the
flanks
in
the
middle
as
it
pleases
them
but
also
they
be
like
the
gipsies
in
manners
and
customs
for
you
can
see
them
huddled
together
like
partridges
in
winter
behind
the
hedges
in
the
shade
or
if
the
season
require
it
in
the
sun
or
else
lying
round
a
fire
smoking
tobacco
and
idling
while
the
good
soldier
meanwhile
must
endure
with
the
colours
heat
thirst
hunger
and
all
manner
of
misery
here
again
goes
a
pack
of
them
pilfering
alongside
the
line
of
march
while
many
a
poor
soldier
is
ready
to
sink
under
the
weight
of
his
arms
they
plunder
all
they
can
find
before
behind
and
beside
the
army
and
what
they
can
not
consume
that
they
spoil
so
that
the
regiments
when
they
come
to
their
quarters
or
into
camp
do
often
find
not
even
a
good
draught
of
water
and
when
they
are
strictly
forced
to
stay
with
the
you
will
often
find
this
greater
in
number
than
the
army
itself
and
though
they
do
march
together
and
lodge
together
fight
and
make
common
cause
yet
have
they
no
captain
to
order
them
no
feldwebel
nor
sergeant
to
dust
their
jackets
no
corporal
to
rouse
them
up
no
drummer
to
summon
them
to
picket
or
bivouac
duty
and
in
a
word
no
one
to
bring
them
into
the
line
of
battle
like
an
adjutant
nor
to
assign
them
their
lodgings
like
a
quartermaster
but
they
live
like
noblemen
howbeit
whenever
a
comes
they
are
the
first
to
claim
their
share
undeserved
though
it
be
yet
are
the
and
his
fellows
their
greatest
plague
being
such
as
at
times
when
they
play
their
tricks
too
scurvily
do
set
iron
bracelets
on
their
hands
and
feet
or
even
adorn
them
with
a
hempen
collar
and
hang
them
up
by
their
precious
necks
they
keep
no
watch
they
dig
no
trenches
they
serve
on
no
forlorn
hope
and
they
will
never
fight
in
line
of
battle
yet
they
be
well
nourished
and
fed
but
what
damage
the
general
the
peasant
and
the
whole
army
in
which
many
such
companions
are
to
be
found
do
suffer
is
not
to
be
described
the
basest
of
that
doth
naught
but
forage
is
worth
to
the
general
more
than
one
thousand
such
that
do
make
a
trade
of
such
foraging
and
lie
at
ease
without
excuse
upon
their
till
they
be
taken
off
by
the
adversary
or
be
rapped
over
the
fingers
when
they
do
meddle
with
the
peasants
so
is
the
army
weakened
and
the
enemy
strengthened
and
even
if
a
scurvy
rogue
of
this
kind
i
mean
not
the
poor
sick
man
but
the
riders
without
horses
that
for
sheer
neglect
do
let
their
horses
perish
and
betake
themselves
to
the
brotherhood
to
save
their
skins
do
so
pass
the
summer
yet
all
the
use
one
can
have
of
him
is
to
equip
him
again
for
the
winter
at
great
cost
that
he
may
have
somewhat
to
lose
in
the
next
campaign
well
to
couple
such
together
like
greyhounds
and
teach
them
to
make
war
in
garrison
towns
or
even
make
them
toil
in
chains
in
the
galleys
if
they
will
not
serve
on
foot
in
the
field
till
they
can
get
a
horse
again
i
say
naught
here
of
the
many
villages
that
by
chance
or
by
malice
have
been
burned
down
by
them
how
many
of
their
own
comrades
they
entice
away
plunder
rob
and
even
murder
nor
how
many
a
spy
can
be
concealed
among
them
if
he
know
but
enough
to
give
the
name
of
a
regiment
and
a
company
in
the
army
to
this
honourable
brotherhood
i
now
must
belong
and
so
remained
till
the
day
before
the
battle
of
wittenweier
at
which
time
our
headquarters
were
at
schüttern
for
going
then
with
my
comrades
into
the
county
of
geroldseck
to
steal
cows
and
oxen
i
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
troops
of
weimar
that
knew
far
better
how
to
treat
us
for
they
made
us
take
musquets
and
distributed
us
in
different
regiments
and
so
i
came
into
hattstein
regiment
of
a
desperate
fight
for
life
in
which
each
party
doth
yet
escape
death
now
could
i
well
understand
i
was
born
but
for
misfortune
for
some
weeks
before
the
engagement
happened
i
heard
some
lower
officers
of
götz
army
that
talked
of
our
war
and
says
one
without
a
battle
will
this
summer
not
pass
and
if
we
win
in
the
next
winter
we
shall
surely
take
freiburg
and
the
but
if
we
earn
a
defeat
we
shall
earn
winter
quarters
too
upon
this
prophecy
i
laid
my
plans
and
said
to
myself
now
rejoice
thee
simplicissimus
for
next
spring
thou
wilt
drink
good
wine
of
the
lake
and
the
neckar
and
wilt
enjoy
all
that
the
troops
of
weimar
can
win
yet
therein
i
was
mightily
deceived
for
being
now
of
those
troops
myself
i
was
predestinated
to
help
lay
siege
to
breisach
for
that
siege
was
fully
set
afoot
presently
after
the
battle
of
wittenweier
and
there
must
i
like
other
musqueteers
watch
and
dig
trenches
day
and
night
and
gained
naught
thereby
save
that
i
learnt
how
to
assail
a
fortress
by
approaches
to
which
matter
i
had
paid
but
scant
attention
in
the
camp
before
magdeburg
for
the
rest
i
was
but
lousily
provided
for
for
two
or
three
must
lodge
together
our
purses
were
empty
and
so
were
wine
beer
and
meat
a
rarity
apples
with
half
as
much
bread
as
i
could
eat
were
my
finest
dainties
and
hard
for
me
to
bear
this
when
i
reflected
on
the
fleshpots
of
egypt
that
is
on
the
westphalian
hams
and
sausages
of
lippstadt
yet
did
i
think
but
little
on
my
wife
and
when
i
did
so
i
did
but
plague
myself
with
the
thought
that
she
might
be
untrue
to
me
at
last
was
i
so
impatient
that
i
declared
to
my
captain
how
my
affairs
stood
and
wrote
by
the
post
to
lippstadt
and
so
heard
from
colonel
saint
andré
and
my
that
they
had
by
letters
to
the
duke
of
weimar
secured
that
my
captain
should
let
me
go
with
a
pass
so
about
a
week
or
four
days
before
christmas
i
marched
away
with
a
good
musquet
on
my
shoulder
from
the
camp
down
through
the
breisgau
being
minded
at
this
same
to
receive
at
strassburg
twenty
thalers
sent
to
me
by
my
and
then
to
betake
myself
down
the
rhine
with
the
traders
since
now
there
were
no
emperor
garrisons
on
the
road
but
when
i
was
now
past
endingen
and
came
to
a
lonely
house
a
shot
was
fired
at
me
so
close
that
the
ball
grazed
the
rim
of
my
hat
and
forthwith
there
sprang
out
upon
me
a
strong
fellow
crying
to
me
to
lay
down
my
gun
so
i
answered
by
god
my
friend
not
to
please
thee
and
therewith
cocked
my
piece
thereupon
he
whipped
out
a
monstrous
thing
that
was
more
like
to
a
headsman
sword
than
a
rapier
and
rushed
upon
me
and
now
that
i
saw
his
true
intent
i
pulled
the
trigger
and
hit
him
so
fair
on
the
forehead
that
he
reeled
and
at
last
fell
so
to
take
my
advantage
of
this
i
quickly
wrested
his
sword
out
of
his
hand
and
would
have
run
him
through
with
it
but
it
would
not
pierce
him
and
then
suddenly
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
seized
me
by
the
hair
and
i
him
but
his
sword
i
had
thrown
away
so
upon
that
we
began
such
a
serious
game
together
as
plainly
shewed
the
bitter
rage
of
each
against
the
other
and
yet
could
neither
be
the
other
master
now
was
i
on
top
and
now
he
and
for
a
moment
both
on
our
feet
which
lasted
not
long
for
each
would
have
the
other
life
but
as
the
blood
gushed
out
in
streams
from
my
nose
and
mouth
i
spat
it
into
mine
enemy
face
since
he
so
greatly
desired
it
and
that
served
me
well
for
it
hindered
him
from
seeing
and
so
we
hauled
each
other
about
in
the
snow
for
more
than
an
hour
till
we
were
so
weary
that
to
all
appearance
the
weakness
of
one
could
not
with
fists
alone
have
overcome
the
weariness
of
the
other
nor
could
either
have
compassed
the
death
of
the
other
of
his
own
strength
and
without
weapon
yet
the
art
of
wrestling
wherein
i
had
often
exercised
myself
at
lippstadt
now
served
me
well
or
i
had
doubtless
paid
the
penalty
for
my
enemy
was
stronger
than
i
and
moreover
proof
against
steel
so
when
we
had
wearied
us
wellnigh
to
death
says
he
at
last
brother
hold
i
cry
you
mercy
so
says
i
nay
thou
hadst
best
have
let
me
pass
at
the
first
and
what
profit
hast
thou
if
i
die
quoth
he
yea
said
i
and
what
profit
hadst
thou
had
if
thou
hadst
shot
me
dead
seeing
that
i
have
not
a
penny
in
my
pocket
on
that
he
begged
my
pardon
and
i
granted
it
and
suffered
him
to
stand
up
after
he
had
sworn
to
me
solemnly
that
he
would
not
only
keep
the
peace
but
would
be
my
faithful
friend
and
servant
yet
had
i
neither
believed
nor
trusted
him
had
i
then
known
of
the
villainies
he
had
already
wrought
but
when
we
were
on
our
feet
we
shook
hands
upon
this
that
what
had
happened
should
be
forgotten
and
each
wondered
that
he
had
found
his
master
in
the
other
for
he
supposed
that
i
was
clad
in
the
same
rogue
hide
as
himself
and
that
i
suffered
him
to
believe
lest
when
he
had
gotten
his
gun
again
he
should
once
more
attack
me
he
had
from
my
bullet
a
great
bruise
on
his
forehead
and
i
too
had
lost
much
blood
yet
both
were
sorest
about
our
necks
which
were
so
twisted
that
neither
could
hold
his
head
upright
but
as
it
drew
towards
evening
and
my
adversary
told
me
that
till
i
came
to
the
kinzig
i
should
meet
neither
dog
nor
cat
still
less
a
man
whereas
he
had
in
a
lonely
hut
not
far
from
the
road
a
good
piece
of
meat
and
a
draught
of
the
best
i
let
myself
be
persuaded
and
went
with
him
he
protesting
with
sighs
all
the
way
how
it
grieved
him
to
have
done
me
a
hurt
how
oliver
conceived
that
he
could
excuse
his
tricks
a
determined
soldier
whose
business
it
is
to
hold
his
life
cheap
and
to
adventure
it
easily
is
but
a
stupid
creature
out
of
a
thousand
fellows
you
could
hardly
have
found
one
that
would
have
gone
as
a
guest
to
an
unknown
place
with
one
that
had
even
now
tried
to
murder
him
on
the
way
i
asked
him
which
army
he
was
of
so
he
said
he
served
no
prince
but
was
his
own
master
and
asked
of
what
party
i
was
i
answered
i
had
served
the
duke
of
weimar
but
had
now
my
discharge
and
was
minded
to
betake
myself
home
then
he
asked
my
name
and
when
i
said
simplicius
he
turned
him
round
for
i
made
him
walk
before
me
because
i
trusted
him
not
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
is
not
thy
name
also
simplicissimus
quoth
he
yea
says
i
he
is
a
rogue
that
denies
his
own
name
and
who
art
thou
why
brother
he
answered
i
am
oliver
whom
thou
wilt
surely
remember
before
magdeburg
with
that
he
cast
away
his
gun
and
fell
on
his
knees
to
beg
for
my
pardon
that
he
had
meant
to
do
me
an
ill
turn
saying
he
could
well
conceive
he
could
have
no
better
friend
in
the
world
than
he
would
find
in
me
since
according
to
old
herzbruder
prophecy
i
was
so
bravely
to
avenge
his
death
and
i
for
my
part
did
wonder
at
so
strange
a
meeting
but
he
said
this
is
nothing
new
mountain
and
valley
can
never
meet
but
what
is
truly
strange
is
this
that
i
from
a
secretary
have
become
a
footpad
and
thou
from
a
fool
a
brave
soldier
be
ye
sure
brother
that
if
there
were
ten
thousand
like
us
we
could
relieve
breisach
and
in
the
end
make
ourselves
masters
of
the
whole
world
with
such
talk
we
came
at
nightfall
to
a
little
remote
cottage
and
though
such
boasting
pleased
me
not
yet
i
said
yea
chiefly
because
his
rogue
temper
was
well
known
to
me
and
though
i
trusted
him
not
at
all
yet
went
i
with
him
into
the
said
house
in
which
a
peasant
was
even
then
lighting
a
fire
to
him
said
oliver
hast
thou
aught
ready
cooked
nay
said
the
peasant
but
i
have
still
the
cold
leg
of
veal
that
i
brought
from
waldkirch
well
then
said
oliver
go
bring
it
here
and
likewise
the
little
cask
of
wine
so
when
the
peasant
was
gone
brother
said
i
for
so
i
called
him
to
be
safer
with
him
thou
hast
a
willing
host
oh
devil
thank
the
rogue
says
he
i
do
keep
his
wife
and
child
for
him
and
also
he
doth
earn
good
booty
for
himself
for
i
do
leave
for
him
all
the
clothes
that
i
capture
for
him
to
turn
to
his
own
profit
so
i
asked
where
he
kept
his
wife
and
child
to
which
oliver
answered
he
had
them
in
safety
in
freiburg
where
he
visited
them
twice
a
week
and
brought
him
from
thence
his
food
as
well
as
powder
and
shot
and
further
he
told
me
he
had
long
practised
this
freebooter
trade
and
that
it
profited
him
more
than
to
serve
any
lord
nor
did
he
think
to
give
it
up
till
he
had
properly
filled
his
purse
brother
says
i
thou
livest
in
a
dangerous
estate
and
if
thou
art
caught
in
such
a
villainy
how
thinkest
thou
fare
with
thee
aha
says
he
i
perceive
thou
art
still
the
old
simplicissimus
i
know
well
that
he
that
would
win
must
stake
somewhat
but
remember
that
their
lordships
of
nuremberg
hang
no
man
till
they
catch
him
so
i
answered
yea
but
put
the
case
brother
that
thou
art
not
caught
which
is
yet
but
unlikely
since
the
pitcher
that
goes
often
to
the
well
must
break
at
last
yet
is
such
a
life
as
thou
leadest
the
most
shameful
in
the
world
so
that
i
scarce
can
believe
thou
canst
desire
to
die
in
it
what
says
he
the
most
shameful
my
brave
simplicissimus
i
assure
thee
that
robbery
is
the
most
noble
exercise
that
one
in
these
days
can
find
in
the
world
tell
me
how
many
kingdoms
and
principalities
be
there
that
have
not
been
stolen
by
violence
and
so
taken
or
is
it
ever
counted
for
evil
of
a
king
or
a
prince
in
the
whole
world
that
he
enjoys
the
revenues
of
his
lands
which
commonly
have
been
gained
by
his
forefathers
with
violence
and
conquest
yea
what
could
be
named
more
noble
than
the
trade
that
i
now
follow
i
well
perceive
that
thou
wouldst
fain
preach
me
a
sermon
showing
how
many
have
been
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
for
murder
and
robbery
but
that
i
know
already
for
so
the
laws
do
command
yet
wilt
thou
see
none
but
poor
and
miserable
thieves
so
put
to
death
as
they
indeed
deserve
for
undertaking
this
noble
craft
which
is
reserved
for
men
of
high
parts
and
capacity
but
when
hast
thou
ever
seen
a
person
of
quality
punished
by
justice
for
that
he
has
oppressed
his
people
too
much
yea
and
more
than
that
when
is
the
usurer
punished
that
yet
doth
pursue
this
noble
trade
in
secret
and
that
too
under
the
cloak
of
christian
love
why
then
should
i
be
punishable
i
that
practise
it
openly
without
concealment
or
hypocrisy
my
good
simplicissimus
thou
hast
never
read
thy
machiavel
i
am
a
man
of
honest
mood
and
do
follow
this
manner
of
life
openly
and
without
shame
i
do
fight
and
do
adventure
my
life
upon
it
like
the
heroes
of
old
and
do
know
that
such
trades
and
likewise
he
that
follows
them
stand
ever
in
peril
but
since
i
do
adventure
my
life
thereupon
it
doth
follow
without
contradiction
that
is
but
just
and
fair
i
should
be
allowed
to
follow
my
trade
to
that
i
answered
whether
robbery
and
theft
be
allowed
to
thee
or
not
yet
do
i
know
that
this
is
against
the
order
of
nature
that
will
not
have
it
so
that
any
man
should
do
to
another
what
he
would
not
have
done
to
himself
and
this
is
wrong
too
as
against
the
laws
of
this
world
which
ordain
that
thieves
shall
be
hanged
and
robbers
beheaded
and
murderers
broken
on
the
wheel
and
lastly
is
also
against
the
laws
of
god
which
is
the
chiefest
point
of
all
for
he
doth
leave
no
sin
unpunished
yea
said
oliver
is
as
i
said
thou
art
still
the
same
old
simplicissimus
that
hath
not
yet
studied
his
machiavel
but
if
i
could
but
set
up
a
monarchy
in
this
fashion
then
would
i
fain
see
who
would
preach
to
me
against
it
and
so
had
we
disputed
longer
but
then
came
the
peasant
with
meat
and
drink
and
so
we
sat
together
and
appeased
our
hunger
of
which
i
at
least
had
much
need
how
oliver
explained
herzbruder
prophecy
to
his
own
profit
and
so
came
to
love
his
worst
enemy
our
food
was
white
bread
and
a
cold
leg
of
veal
and
moreover
we
had
a
good
sup
of
wine
and
a
warm
room
aha
simplicissimus
said
oliver
is
better
here
than
in
the
trenches
before
breisach
true
said
i
if
one
could
enjoy
such
a
life
with
safety
and
a
good
conscience
at
that
he
laughed
loud
and
says
he
yea
are
the
poor
devils
in
the
trenches
safer
than
we
that
must
every
moment
expect
a
sally
of
the
garrison
my
good
simplicissimus
i
do
plainly
see
that
though
thou
hast
cast
aside
thy
fool
cap
thou
hast
kept
thy
fool
head
that
can
not
understand
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
and
if
thou
wert
any
but
that
same
simplicissimus
that
after
herzbruder
prophecy
must
avenge
my
death
i
would
make
thee
to
confess
that
i
do
lead
a
nobler
life
than
any
baron
with
that
i
did
think
how
will
it
go
now
thou
must
devise
another
manner
of
speech
or
this
barbarous
creature
with
the
help
of
his
peasant
may
well
make
an
end
of
thee
so
says
i
who
did
ever
hear
at
any
time
that
the
scholar
should
know
more
than
the
master
and
so
brother
if
thou
hast
so
happy
a
life
as
thou
dost
pretend
give
me
a
share
in
thy
good
luck
for
of
good
luck
i
have
great
need
to
which
oliver
answered
brother
be
thou
assured
that
i
love
thee
as
mine
own
self
and
that
the
affront
i
put
upon
thee
doth
pain
me
more
than
the
bullet
wherewith
thou
didst
wound
my
forehead
when
thou
didst
so
defend
thyself
as
should
any
proper
man
of
courage
therefore
why
should
i
deny
thee
anything
if
it
please
thee
stay
thou
here
with
me
i
will
provide
for
thee
as
for
myself
or
if
thou
hast
no
desire
to
stay
with
me
then
will
i
give
thee
a
good
purse
of
money
and
go
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
wilt
and
that
thou
mayest
believe
that
these
words
do
come
from
my
heart
i
will
tell
thee
the
reason
wherefore
i
do
hold
thee
in
such
esteem
thou
dost
know
how
rightly
old
herzbruder
did
hit
it
off
with
his
prophecies
and
look
you
that
same
did
so
prophesy
to
me
when
we
lay
before
magdeburg
saying
look
upon
our
fool
as
thou
wilt
yet
will
he
astonish
thee
by
his
courage
and
play
thee
the
worst
tricks
thou
hast
ever
known
for
which
thou
shalt
give
him
good
cause
at
a
time
when
ye
know
not
one
another
yet
will
he
not
only
spare
thy
life
when
it
is
in
his
hands
but
after
a
long
time
he
will
come
to
the
place
where
thou
art
to
be
slain
and
there
will
he
avenge
thy
death
and
for
the
sake
of
this
prophecy
my
dear
simplicissimus
am
i
ready
to
share
with
thee
the
very
heart
in
my
breast
for
already
is
a
part
of
that
prophecy
fulfilled
seeing
that
i
gave
thee
good
reason
to
shoot
me
in
the
head
like
a
valiant
soldier
and
to
take
my
sword
from
me
which
no
other
hath
ever
done
and
to
grant
me
my
life
when
i
lay
under
thee
and
was
choking
in
blood
and
so
i
doubt
not
that
the
rest
of
the
prophecy
which
concerns
my
life
shall
be
fulfilled
and
from
this
matter
of
the
revenge
i
must
conclude
brother
that
thou
art
my
true
friend
for
an
thou
wert
not
thou
wouldest
not
take
upon
thee
to
avenge
me
and
now
thou
hast
the
innermost
thoughts
of
my
heart
so
now
do
thou
tell
me
what
thou
art
minded
to
do
upon
that
i
thought
the
devil
trust
thee
for
i
do
not
if
i
take
money
from
thee
for
the
journey
i
may
well
be
the
first
whom
thou
slayest
and
if
i
stay
with
thee
i
must
expect
some
time
to
be
hanged
with
thee
so
i
determined
i
would
befool
him
tarrying
with
him
till
i
could
find
opportunity
to
be
quit
of
him
and
so
i
said
if
he
would
suffer
me
i
would
stay
with
him
a
day
or
a
week
to
see
if
i
could
accustom
myself
to
his
manner
of
life
and
if
it
pleased
me
he
should
find
in
me
a
true
friend
and
a
good
soldier
and
if
it
pleased
me
not
we
could
at
any
time
part
in
peace
and
on
that
he
drank
to
my
health
yet
i
trusted
him
not
and
feigned
to
be
drunken
before
i
was
so
to
see
if
he
would
be
at
me
when
i
could
not
defend
myself
meanwhile
the
fleas
did
mightily
plague
me
whereof
i
had
brought
good
store
from
breisach
for
when
it
grew
warm
they
were
no
longer
content
to
remain
in
my
rags
but
walked
abroad
to
take
their
pleasure
of
that
oliver
was
aware
and
asked
me
had
i
lice
to
which
i
answered
yea
indeed
and
more
than
i
can
hope
to
have
ducats
in
my
life
say
not
so
said
oliver
for
if
thou
wilt
abide
with
me
thou
canst
earn
more
ducats
than
thou
hast
lice
now
i
answered
is
as
impossible
as
that
i
can
be
quit
of
my
lice
yea
says
he
but
both
are
possible
and
with
that
he
commanded
the
peasant
to
fetch
me
a
suit
that
lay
in
a
hollow
tree
near
the
house
which
was
a
grey
hat
a
cape
of
a
pair
of
scarlet
breeches
and
a
grey
coat
and
shoes
and
stockings
would
he
give
me
next
day
so
as
i
saw
him
so
generous
i
trusted
him
somewhat
better
than
before
and
went
to
bed
content
how
simplicissimus
thought
more
piously
when
he
went
than
did
oliver
when
he
went
to
church
so
the
next
morning
as
day
began
to
break
says
oliver
up
simplicissimus
we
will
fare
forth
in
god
name
to
see
what
we
can
come
by
good
lord
thought
i
must
i
then
in
thy
holy
name
go
i
that
aforetime
when
i
left
my
good
hermit
could
not
hear
without
marvelling
when
one
man
said
to
another
come
brother
we
will
in
god
name
take
off
a
cup
of
wine
together
for
that
i
counted
a
double
sin
that
a
man
should
be
drunken
and
drunken
in
god
name
my
heavenly
father
thought
i
how
am
i
changed
since
then
my
faithful
lord
what
will
at
last
become
of
me
if
i
turn
not
oh
check
thou
my
course
that
will
assuredly
bring
me
to
hell
if
i
repent
not
so
speaking
and
so
thinking
did
i
follow
oliver
to
a
village
wherein
was
no
living
creature
and
there
to
have
a
better
view
we
did
go
up
into
the
church
steeple
there
had
he
in
hiding
the
shoes
and
stockings
that
he
had
promised
me
the
night
before
and
moreover
two
loaves
of
bread
some
pieces
of
dried
meat
and
a
barrel
half
full
of
wine
which
would
have
easily
afforded
him
provision
for
a
week
so
while
i
was
putting
on
what
he
gave
me
he
told
me
here
was
the
place
where
he
was
wont
to
wait
when
he
hoped
for
good
booty
to
which
end
he
had
so
well
provisioned
himself
and
in
a
word
told
me
he
had
several
such
places
provided
with
meat
and
drink
so
that
if
he
could
not
find
a
friend
at
home
in
one
place
he
might
catch
him
elsewhere
for
this
must
i
praise
his
prudence
yet
gave
him
to
understand
that
was
not
well
so
to
misuse
a
place
that
was
dedicated
to
god
service
what
says
he
misuse
the
churches
themselves
if
they
could
speak
would
confess
that
what
i
do
in
them
is
naught
in
comparison
with
the
sins
that
have
aforetime
been
committed
in
them
how
many
a
man
and
how
many
a
woman
thinkst
thou
have
come
into
this
church
since
it
was
built
on
pretence
of
serving
god
but
truly
only
to
shew
their
new
clothes
their
fine
figure
and
all
their
bravery
here
cometh
one
into
church
like
a
peacock
and
putteth
himself
so
before
the
altar
as
he
would
pray
the
very
feet
off
the
saints
images
and
there
standeth
another
in
a
corner
to
sigh
like
the
publican
in
the
temple
which
sighs
be
yet
only
for
his
mistress
on
whose
face
he
feedeth
his
eyes
yea
for
whose
sake
he
is
come
thither
another
cometh
to
the
church
with
a
packet
of
papers
like
one
that
gathereth
contributions
for
a
fire
yet
more
to
put
his
debtors
in
mind
than
to
pray
and
an
he
had
not
known
those
debtors
would
be
in
the
church
he
had
sat
at
home
over
his
ledgers
yea
it
doth
happen
often
that
when
our
masters
will
give
notice
of
aught
to
a
parish
it
must
be
done
of
a
sunday
in
the
church
for
which
reason
many
a
farmer
doth
fear
the
church
more
than
any
poor
sinner
doth
fear
the
judge
and
jury
and
thinkest
thou
not
there
be
many
buried
in
churches
that
have
deserved
sword
gallows
fire
and
wheel
many
a
man
could
not
have
brought
his
lecherous
intent
to
a
good
end
had
not
the
church
helped
him
is
a
bargain
to
be
driven
or
a
loan
to
be
granted
is
done
at
the
church
door
many
a
usurer
there
is
that
can
spare
no
time
in
the
week
to
reckon
up
his
rogueries
that
can
sit
in
church
of
a
sunday
and
devise
how
to
practise
fresh
villainies
yea
here
they
sit
during
mass
and
sermon
to
argue
and
talk
as
if
the
church
were
built
for
such
purpose
only
and
there
be
matters
talked
of
that
in
private
houses
none
would
speak
about
some
do
sit
and
snore
as
if
they
had
hired
the
place
to
sleep
in
and
some
do
naught
but
gossip
of
others
and
do
whisper
well
did
the
pastor
touch
up
this
one
or
that
one
in
his
sermon
and
others
do
give
heed
to
the
discourse
but
for
this
reason
only
not
to
be
bettered
by
it
but
that
they
may
carp
at
and
blame
their
minister
if
he
do
but
stumble
once
at
a
word
as
they
understand
the
matter
and
here
will
i
say
naught
of
the
stories
i
have
read
of
amorous
intercourse
that
hath
its
beginning
and
end
in
a
church
for
i
could
not
now
remember
all
i
could
tell
thee
of
that
yet
canst
thou
see
how
men
do
not
only
defile
churches
with
their
vices
while
they
live
but
do
fill
them
with
their
vanity
and
folly
after
they
be
dead
go
thou
now
into
a
church
and
there
by
the
gravestones
and
epitaphs
thou
wilt
see
how
they
that
the
worms
have
long
ago
devoured
do
yet
boast
themselves
look
thou
up
and
there
wilt
thou
see
more
shields
and
helmets
and
swords
and
banners
and
boots
and
spurs
than
in
many
an
armoury
so
that
is
no
wonder
that
in
this
war
the
peasants
have
fought
for
their
own
in
churches
as
if
in
fortresses
and
why
then
should
it
not
be
allowed
to
me
to
me
i
say
as
a
soldier
to
ply
my
trade
in
a
church
whereas
aforetime
two
holy
fathers
did
for
the
mere
sake
of
precedence
cause
such
a
in
a
church
that
was
more
like
to
a
than
a
holy
place
yea
i
would
not
so
act
if
any
did
come
here
to
do
god
service
for
i
am
but
of
the
lay
people
yet
they
that
were
clergymen
respected
not
the
high
majesty
of
the
emperor
himself
and
why
should
it
be
forbidden
to
me
to
earn
my
living
by
the
church
when
so
many
do
so
earn
it
and
is
it
just
that
so
many
a
rich
man
can
for
a
fee
be
buried
in
the
church
to
bear
witness
of
his
own
pride
and
his
friends
pride
while
yet
the
poor
man
that
may
have
been
as
good
a
christian
as
he
and
perchance
a
better
that
can
pay
naught
must
be
buried
in
a
corner
without
is
as
a
man
looks
upon
it
had
i
but
known
that
thou
wouldst
scruple
so
to
lay
wait
in
a
church
i
had
devised
another
answer
for
thee
but
in
the
meanwhile
have
thou
patience
till
i
can
persuade
thee
to
a
better
mind
now
would
i
fain
have
answered
oliver
that
they
were
but
lewd
fellows
that
did
dishonour
the
churches
as
did
he
and
that
they
would
yet
have
their
reward
yet
as
i
trusted
him
not
and
had
already
once
quarrelled
with
him
i
let
it
pass
thereafter
he
asked
me
to
tell
him
how
it
had
fared
with
me
since
we
parted
before
wittstock
and
moreover
why
i
had
had
the
jester
clothes
on
when
i
came
into
the
camp
before
magdeburg
yet
as
my
throat
did
mightily
pain
me
i
did
excuse
myself
and
prayed
him
he
would
tell
me
the
story
of
his
life
that
perchance
might
have
strange
happenings
in
it
to
that
did
he
agree
and
began
in
this
manner
to
tell
me
of
his
wicked
life
of
oliver
descent
and
how
he
behaved
in
his
youth
and
specially
at
school
my
father
said
oliver
was
born
not
far
from
aachen
town
of
poor
parents
for
which
reason
he
must
in
his
youth
take
service
with
a
rich
trader
that
dealt
in
copper
wares
and
there
did
he
carry
himself
so
well
that
his
master
had
him
taught
to
write
read
and
reckon
and
set
him
over
his
whole
household
as
did
potiphar
joseph
and
that
was
well
for
both
parties
for
the
merchant
wealth
grew
more
and
more
through
my
father
zeal
and
prudence
and
my
father
became
prouder
and
prouder
through
his
prosperity
so
that
he
grew
ashamed
of
his
parents
and
despised
them
of
which
they
complained
yet
to
no
purpose
so
when
he
was
years
of
age
then
died
the
merchant
and
left
an
aged
widow
and
one
daughter
which
last
had
played
the
fool
and
was
not
barren
but
her
child
soon
followed
his
grandfather
thereupon
my
father
when
he
saw
her
at
once
fatherless
and
childless
but
not
moneyless
cared
not
at
all
that
she
could
wear
no
maiden
garland
again
but
began
to
pay
her
court
the
which
her
mother
well
allowed
not
only
because
her
daughter
might
so
recover
her
reputation
but
also
because
my
father
possessed
all
knowledge
of
the
business
and
in
especial
could
well
wield
the
jews
spear
and
so
by
this
marriage
was
my
father
in
a
moment
a
rich
man
and
i
his
son
and
heir
whom
for
his
wealth
sake
he
caused
to
be
tenderly
brought
up
so
was
i
kept
in
clothes
like
a
young
nobleman
in
food
like
a
baron
and
in
attendance
like
a
count
for
all
which
i
had
more
to
thank
copper
and
calamine
than
silver
and
gold
so
before
i
reached
my
seventh
year
i
had
given
good
proof
of
what
i
was
to
be
for
the
nettle
that
is
to
be
stings
early
no
roguery
was
too
bad
for
me
and
where
i
could
play
any
man
a
trick
i
failed
not
to
do
so
for
neither
father
nor
mother
punished
me
for
it
i
tramped
with
young
rascals
like
myself
through
thick
and
thin
in
the
streets
and
was
already
bold
enough
to
fight
boys
stronger
than
myself
and
did
i
get
beat
my
foolish
parents
would
say
now
is
a
great
fellow
like
that
to
beat
a
mere
child
but
if
i
won
for
i
would
scratch
and
bite
and
throw
stones
then
said
they
little
oliver
will
turn
out
a
fine
fellow
and
with
that
my
indolence
grew
for
praying
i
was
yet
too
young
and
if
i
did
curse
like
a
trooper
was
said
i
knew
not
what
i
said
so
i
became
worse
and
worse
till
i
was
sent
to
school
and
there
i
did
carry
out
what
other
wicked
lads
do
mostly
think
of
yet
dare
not
practise
and
if
i
spoiled
or
tore
my
books
my
mother
would
buy
me
others
lest
my
miserly
father
should
be
wroth
my
schoolmaster
did
i
plague
most
for
he
might
not
deal
with
me
hardly
receiving
many
presents
from
my
parents
whose
foolish
love
to
me
was
well
known
to
him
in
summer
would
i
catch
crickets
and
bring
them
secretly
into
the
schoolroom
where
they
did
play
a
merry
tune
in
winter
would
i
steal
snuff
and
scatter
it
in
that
place
where
is
the
custom
to
whip
the
boys
and
so
if
any
scholar
should
struggle
my
powder
would
fly
about
and
cause
an
agreeable
pastime
for
then
must
all
sneeze
together
so
now
i
deemed
myself
too
great
a
man
for
small
roguery
but
all
my
striving
was
for
higher
things
often
would
i
steal
from
one
and
put
what
i
had
stolen
in
another
pouch
to
earn
him
stripes
and
with
these
tricks
was
i
so
sly
that
i
was
scarce
ever
caught
and
of
the
wars
we
waged
wherein
i
was
commonly
colonel
and
the
blows
i
received
for
i
had
ever
a
scratched
face
and
a
head
full
of
bruises
i
need
not
to
speak
for
every
man
doth
know
how
boys
do
behave
and
so
from
what
i
have
said
canst
thou
easily
guess
how
in
other
respects
i
spent
my
youth
how
he
studied
at
liege
and
how
he
there
demeaned
himself
now
the
more
my
father
riches
increased
the
more
flatterers
and
parasites
he
had
round
him
all
which
did
praise
my
fine
capacities
for
study
but
said
no
word
of
all
my
other
faults
or
at
least
would
excuse
them
seeing
well
that
any
that
did
not
so
could
never
stand
well
with
my
father
and
mother
and
so
had
they
more
pleasure
in
their
son
than
ever
had
a
tomtit
that
has
reared
a
young
cuckoo
so
they
hired
for
me
a
special
tutor
and
sent
me
with
him
to
liège
more
to
learn
foreign
tongues
than
to
study
for
i
was
to
be
no
theologian
but
a
trader
he
moreover
had
his
orders
not
to
be
hard
with
me
lest
that
should
breed
in
me
a
fearful
and
servile
spirit
he
was
to
allow
me
freely
to
consort
with
the
students
lest
i
might
become
shamefaced
and
must
remember
that
was
to
make
not
a
monk
but
a
man
of
the
world
of
me
one
that
should
know
the
difference
between
black
and
white
but
my
said
tutor
needed
no
such
instruction
being
of
himself
given
to
all
manner
of
knaveries
and
how
could
he
forbid
me
such
or
rebuke
me
for
my
little
faults
when
he
himself
committed
greater
to
wine
and
women
was
he
by
nature
most
inclined
but
i
to
wrestling
and
fighting
so
did
i
prowl
about
the
streets
at
night
with
him
and
his
likes
and
learned
of
him
in
brief
space
more
lechery
than
latin
but
as
to
my
studies
therein
i
could
rely
on
a
good
memory
and
a
keen
wit
and
was
therefore
the
more
careless
but
for
the
rest
i
was
sunk
in
all
manner
of
vice
roguery
and
wantonness
and
already
was
my
conscience
so
wide
that
one
could
have
driven
a
waggon
and
horses
through
it
i
heeded
nothing
if
i
could
but
read
berni
or
burchiello
or
aretine
during
the
sermon
in
church
nor
did
i
hear
any
part
of
the
service
with
greater
joy
than
when
was
said
missa
est
all
which
time
i
thought
no
little
of
myself
but
carried
me
right
foppishly
every
day
was
for
me
a
and
because
i
behaved
myself
as
a
man
of
estate
and
spent
not
only
the
great
sums
that
my
father
sent
me
for
my
needs
but
also
my
mother
plentiful
therefore
the
women
began
to
pay
us
court
but
specially
to
my
tutor
from
these
baggages
i
learned
to
wench
and
to
game
how
to
quarrel
to
wrestle
and
to
fight
i
knew
well
before
and
my
tutor
in
no
wise
forbade
my
debaucheries
since
he
himself
was
glad
to
take
part
in
them
so
for
a
year
and
a
half
did
this
monstrous
fine
life
endure
till
my
father
did
hear
of
it
from
one
that
was
his
factor
in
liège
with
whom
indeed
we
had
at
first
lodged
this
man
received
orders
to
keep
a
sharper
eye
upon
us
to
dismiss
my
tutor
at
once
to
shorten
my
tether
and
to
examine
into
my
expense
more
carefully
which
vexed
us
both
mightily
and
though
he
my
tutor
had
now
his
congé
yet
did
we
hold
together
one
way
or
the
other
both
by
day
and
night
yet
since
we
could
no
longer
spend
money
as
before
we
did
join
ourselves
to
a
rogue
that
robbed
folks
of
their
cloaks
at
night
yea
or
did
drown
them
in
the
meuse
and
what
we
in
this
fashion
earned
with
desperate
peril
of
our
lives
that
we
squandered
with
our
whores
and
let
all
studies
go
their
way
so
one
night
as
we
after
our
custom
were
prowling
by
night
to
plunder
students
of
their
cloaks
we
were
overcome
my
tutor
run
through
the
body
and
i
with
five
others
that
were
right
rascals
caught
and
laid
by
the
heels
and
next
day
we
being
examined
and
i
naming
my
father
factor
that
was
a
man
much
respected
the
same
was
sent
for
questioned
concerning
me
and
i
on
his
surety
set
free
yet
so
that
i
must
remain
in
his
house
in
arrest
till
further
order
taken
meanwhile
was
my
tutor
buried
the
other
five
punished
as
rogues
robbers
and
murderers
and
my
father
informed
of
my
case
upon
which
he
came
himself
with
all
haste
to
liège
settled
my
business
with
money
preached
me
a
sharp
sermon
and
shewed
me
what
trouble
and
unhappiness
i
had
caused
him
yea
and
told
me
it
seemed
as
my
mother
would
go
desperate
by
reason
of
my
ill
conduct
and
further
threatened
me
in
case
i
did
not
behave
better
he
would
disinherit
me
and
send
me
packing
to
the
devil
so
i
promised
amendment
and
rode
home
with
him
and
so
ended
my
studies
of
the
homecoming
and
departure
of
this
worshipful
student
and
how
he
sought
to
obtain
advancement
in
the
wars
but
when
my
father
had
me
safely
home
he
found
i
was
in
very
truth
spoiled
i
had
proved
no
worshipful
dominie
as
he
had
hoped
but
a
quarreller
and
a
braggart
that
imagined
he
knew
everything
so
hardly
was
i
warm
at
home
when
he
said
to
me
oliver
i
do
see
thine
asses
ears
fast
thou
beest
a
useless
cumberer
of
the
ground
a
rogue
that
will
never
be
worth
aught
to
learn
a
trade
art
thou
too
old
to
serve
a
lord
thou
art
too
insolent
and
to
understand
and
follow
my
profession
thou
art
but
useless
alas
what
have
i
accomplished
with
all
the
cost
that
i
have
spent
on
thee
for
i
did
hope
to
have
my
joy
in
thee
and
to
make
of
thee
a
man
and
now
must
i
buy
thee
out
of
the
hangman
hand
oh
fie
for
shame
best
i
should
set
thee
in
a
treadmill
and
let
thee
eat
the
bread
of
affliction
till
some
better
luck
arise
for
thee
when
thou
shalt
have
purged
thee
of
thine
iniquities
now
when
i
must
day
by
day
hear
such
lectures
at
the
last
was
i
out
of
all
patience
and
told
my
father
roundly
i
was
not
guilty
of
all
but
he
and
my
tutor
that
led
me
astray
and
had
he
no
joy
of
me
so
was
he
rightly
served
that
had
given
his
parents
no
joy
of
him
but
had
let
them
come
to
beggary
and
starvation
on
that
he
reached
for
a
stick
and
would
have
paid
me
for
my
plain
speaking
swearing
loud
and
long
he
would
have
me
to
the
house
of
correction
at
amsterdam
so
away
i
went
and
the
same
night
betook
me
to
his
newly
bought
farm
watched
my
opportunity
and
rode
off
to
cologne
on
the
best
horse
i
could
find
in
his
stables
this
horse
did
i
sell
and
forthwith
lit
upon
even
such
a
crew
of
rogues
and
thieves
as
i
had
left
at
liège
so
at
play
they
did
know
me
for
what
i
was
and
i
them
for
both
did
know
so
much
straightway
i
was
made
one
of
their
brotherhood
and
was
their
helper
in
their
nightly
excursions
yet
when
presently
one
of
our
band
was
caught
in
the
old
market
as
he
would
relieve
a
lady
of
quality
of
her
heavy
purse
and
specially
when
i
had
seen
him
stand
an
hour
in
the
pillory
with
an
iron
collar
on
and
further
had
seen
one
of
his
ears
cut
off
and
himself
well
whipped
that
trade
pleased
me
no
more
but
i
enlisted
as
a
soldier
for
just
then
the
colonel
with
whom
we
served
before
magdeburg
was
meanwhile
had
my
father
learned
where
i
was
and
so
did
write
to
his
factor
he
should
inquire
concerning
me
which
befell
even
then
when
i
had
drawn
my
first
pay
and
that
the
factor
told
my
father
which
gave
orders
that
he
should
buy
me
out
cost
it
what
it
might
but
when
i
heard
that
i
had
fear
of
the
house
of
correction
and
so
would
not
be
bought
out
through
this
was
my
colonel
aware
i
was
a
rich
merchant
son
and
so
fixed
his
price
so
high
that
my
father
left
me
as
i
was
intending
to
let
me
kick
my
heels
awhile
in
the
wars
and
so
perchance
come
to
a
better
mind
was
not
long
before
it
happened
that
my
colonel
writer
died
in
whose
place
he
employed
me
as
thou
knowest
and
thereupon
i
began
to
have
high
thoughts
in
hope
to
rise
from
one
rank
to
another
and
so
in
the
end
to
become
a
general
from
our
secretary
i
did
learn
how
to
carry
myself
and
my
intent
to
grow
to
a
great
man
caused
me
to
behave
myself
as
a
man
of
honour
and
repute
and
no
longer
as
of
old
time
to
play
rogues
tricks
yet
had
i
no
luck
till
our
secretary
died
and
then
methought
must
see
to
it
that
thou
hast
his
place
and
all
i
could
i
spent
for
when
my
mother
heard
i
had
begun
to
do
well
she
ever
sent
me
moneys
yet
because
young
herzbruder
was
beloved
by
our
colonel
and
was
preferred
to
me
i
purposed
to
have
him
out
of
the
way
specially
because
i
was
sure
the
colonel
would
give
him
the
place
and
at
the
delaying
of
the
promotion
which
i
so
much
desired
i
was
so
impatient
that
i
had
me
made
bullet
proof
by
our
provost
so
to
fight
with
herzbruder
and
settle
matters
by
the
sword
yet
could
i
not
civilly
come
at
him
yea
and
our
provost
warned
me
from
my
purpose
and
said
if
thou
makest
him
a
sacrifice
yet
will
it
do
thee
more
harm
than
good
for
thou
wilt
but
have
murdered
the
favourite
yet
did
he
advise
me
i
should
steal
somewhat
in
herzbruder
presence
and
give
it
to
him
for
so
could
he
bring
it
about
that
he
should
lose
the
colonel
favour
to
that
i
agreed
and
stole
the
cup
at
the
colonel
and
gave
it
to
the
provost
by
means
of
which
he
rid
me
of
young
herzbruder
as
thou
wilt
surely
remember
even
then
when
he
by
his
sorcery
filled
thy
pockets
with
puppies
how
simplicissimus
fulfilled
herzbruder
prophecy
to
oliver
before
yet
either
knew
the
other
all
was
green
and
yellow
before
mine
eyes
when
i
must
so
hear
from
oliver
own
mouth
how
he
had
gone
about
with
my
best
friend
and
yet
i
could
take
no
revenge
mine
inclination
thereto
i
must
needs
pocket
up
lest
he
should
mark
it
and
so
begged
he
should
tell
me
how
it
had
further
fared
with
him
before
the
battle
at
wittstock
why
in
that
encounter
said
oliver
i
carried
myself
like
no
that
is
set
upon
his
inkstand
but
like
a
good
soldier
being
well
mounted
and
and
moreover
being
counted
in
no
squadron
for
so
could
i
show
my
proper
valour
as
one
that
doth
mean
to
rise
higher
by
his
sword
or
to
die
so
did
i
fly
around
our
brigade
like
a
whirlwind
both
to
exercise
myself
and
to
shew
our
men
i
was
more
fit
for
arms
than
for
the
pen
yet
all
availed
nothing
for
the
swedes
luck
prevailed
and
i
must
share
the
of
our
folk
and
must
accept
that
quarter
which
a
little
before
i
would
have
given
to
no
man
so
was
i
with
the
other
prisoners
put
into
a
foot
regiment
which
same
was
presently
sent
away
to
pomerania
on
furlough
where
since
there
were
many
raw
recruits
and
i
had
shown
a
very
notable
courage
i
was
promoted
corporal
yet
i
was
minded
to
make
no
long
stay
there
but
as
soon
as
might
be
to
return
to
the
emperor
service
to
which
party
i
was
ever
most
affected
and
that
although
doubtless
my
advancement
had
been
far
quicker
among
the
swedes
and
my
escape
i
brought
to
pass
thus
i
was
sent
out
with
seven
musqueteers
to
a
neighbouring
post
to
demand
the
contribution
which
was
in
arrears
and
so
having
got
together
some
eight
hundred
gulden
or
more
i
shewed
my
fellows
the
gold
and
caused
their
eyes
to
lust
after
it
so
much
so
that
we
agreed
to
divide
the
same
and
so
make
our
escape
this
being
settled
i
did
persuade
three
of
them
to
help
me
to
shoot
the
other
four
dead
and
such
being
accomplished
we
divided
the
money
namely
gulden
to
each
and
with
that
we
marched
off
to
westphalia
yet
on
the
way
did
i
persuade
one
of
the
three
to
help
me
to
knock
the
other
two
on
the
head
and
then
when
we
two
were
to
divide
the
spoil
i
did
make
an
end
with
the
last
man
and
so
came
by
good
luck
safely
with
the
money
to
wesel
where
i
took
up
my
quarters
and
made
merry
with
my
money
but
when
this
was
now
nearly
spent
and
i
still
had
my
love
of
fine
living
then
did
i
hear
of
a
certain
young
soldier
of
soest
and
what
fine
booty
he
had
gained
and
what
a
name
he
had
earned
and
so
was
i
heartened
up
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
and
as
they
called
him
by
reason
of
his
green
clothing
the
huntsman
so
did
i
have
such
green
raiment
made
for
myself
and
under
his
name
did
so
plunder
and
steal
in
his
and
our
own
quarters
and
that
with
every
circumstance
of
wanton
mischief
that
it
came
near
to
this
that
foraging
parties
should
be
forbidden
on
both
sides
he
is
true
stayed
at
home
but
when
i
still
went
on
in
his
name
all
i
could
then
did
that
same
huntsman
for
that
same
reason
challenge
me
but
the
devil
might
fight
with
him
for
as
was
told
me
he
had
ever
the
devil
in
his
jacket
and
that
devil
had
soon
made
an
end
of
my
yet
could
i
not
escape
his
craft
for
with
the
help
of
a
servant
of
his
did
he
beguile
me
with
my
comrade
into
a
and
there
would
force
me
in
the
presence
of
two
living
devils
that
were
his
seconders
by
his
side
to
fight
with
him
by
moonlight
which
when
i
refused
they
did
compel
me
to
the
most
contemptible
actions
in
the
world
and
that
my
comrade
soon
spread
abroad
of
which
i
was
so
shamed
that
i
up
and
away
to
lippstadt
and
there
took
service
with
the
hessians
yet
there
i
remained
not
long
where
none
could
trust
me
but
tramped
away
further
to
the
dutch
and
there
did
i
find
is
true
more
punctual
payment
but
too
slow
a
war
for
my
humour
for
there
were
we
kept
in
like
monks
and
must
live
as
chastely
as
nuns
so
since
i
could
no
more
shew
my
face
among
either
imperials
swedes
or
hessians
had
i
been
willing
wantonly
to
run
the
risk
as
having
deserted
from
all
three
and
since
i
could
now
no
longer
stay
with
the
hollanders
having
violently
deflowered
a
maiden
which
act
seemed
likely
presently
to
bring
about
its
results
i
thought
to
take
refuge
with
the
spaniards
in
the
hope
to
escape
home
from
them
and
to
see
how
my
parents
fared
yet
as
i
set
about
that
plan
i
missed
my
points
of
the
compass
so
foully
that
i
fell
among
the
bavarians
with
whom
i
marched
among
the
merodians
from
westphalia
as
far
as
the
breisgau
and
earned
me
a
living
by
dicing
and
stealing
when
i
had
aught
i
spent
my
day
on
the
and
my
night
among
the
sutlers
had
i
naught
i
stole
what
i
could
and
often
in
a
day
two
or
three
horses
both
from
pasture
and
from
stables
sold
them
and
gamed
away
what
i
got
and
then
at
night
i
would
burrow
under
the
soldiers
tents
and
steal
away
their
purses
from
under
their
very
heads
were
we
on
the
march
i
would
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
the
portmantles
that
the
women
did
carry
behind
them
these
would
i
cut
away
and
so
i
kept
myself
alive
till
the
battle
before
wittenweier
wherein
i
was
made
prisoner
once
more
thrust
into
a
and
so
made
one
of
weimar
soldiers
but
the
camp
before
breisach
liked
me
not
so
i
left
it
early
and
went
off
to
forage
for
myself
as
thou
seest
i
do
and
be
thou
well
assured
brother
that
already
i
have
laid
low
many
a
proud
fellow
and
have
earned
a
noble
stock
of
money
nor
am
i
minded
to
cease
till
i
see
i
can
get
no
more
and
now
it
doth
come
to
thy
turn
to
tell
me
of
thy
life
and
fortunes
how
it
doth
fare
with
a
man
on
whom
evil
fortune
doth
rain
cats
and
dogs
now
when
oliver
had
ended
his
discourse
i
could
not
enough
admire
the
providence
of
god
now
could
i
understand
how
the
good
god
had
not
alone
protected
me
like
a
father
from
this
monster
in
westphalia
but
had
moreover
so
brought
it
about
that
he
should
go
in
fear
of
me
now
could
i
see
what
a
trick
i
had
played
on
him
to
which
the
old
herzbruder
prophecy
did
apply
yet
which
he
himself
expounded
as
may
be
seen
in
the
fourteenth
chapter
in
another
way
and
that
to
my
great
profit
for
had
this
beast
but
known
i
was
the
huntsman
of
soest
he
had
surely
made
me
drink
of
the
same
cup
i
served
to
him
before
at
the
i
considered
moreover
how
wisely
and
darkly
herzbruder
had
delivered
his
predictions
and
thought
in
myself
that
though
his
prophecies
were
wont
commonly
to
turn
out
true
yet
go
hard
and
must
happen
strangely
if
i
was
to
revenge
the
death
of
one
that
had
deserved
the
wheel
and
the
gallows
i
found
it
also
good
for
my
health
that
i
had
not
first
told
him
of
my
life
for
so
had
i
told
him
the
way
how
i
before
had
disgraced
him
and
as
i
thought
thereupon
i
did
mark
in
oliver
face
certain
scratches
that
he
had
not
at
magdeburg
and
so
did
conceive
that
these
scars
were
the
tokens
of
when
at
that
former
time
he
in
the
likeness
of
a
devil
did
thus
scrabble
his
face
and
so
asked
him
whence
he
had
those
signs
adding
thereto
that
though
he
had
told
me
his
whole
life
yet
i
must
gather
that
he
had
left
out
the
best
part
since
he
had
not
yet
told
me
who
had
so
marked
him
ah
brother
answered
he
were
i
to
tell
all
my
tricks
and
rogueries
the
time
would
be
too
long
both
for
you
and
me
yet
to
shew
thee
that
i
conceal
from
thee
none
of
my
adventures
i
will
tell
thee
the
truth
of
this
though
methinks
is
but
a
sorry
story
for
me
i
am
fully
assured
that
from
my
mother
womb
i
was
predestined
to
a
scratched
face
for
in
my
very
childhood
i
was
so
treated
by
my
schoolfellows
when
i
wrangled
with
them
and
so
likewise
one
of
those
devils
that
waited
on
the
huntsman
of
soest
handled
me
so
roughly
that
six
weeks
long
one
could
see
the
marks
of
his
claws
in
my
face
but
the
scars
thou
seest
in
my
face
had
another
beginning
to
wit
this
when
i
lay
in
winter
quarters
with
the
swedes
in
pomerania
and
had
a
fair
mistress
by
me
mine
host
must
leave
his
bed
for
us
to
lie
there
but
his
cat
that
had
been
used
to
sleep
therein
would
come
every
night
and
plague
us
as
one
that
could
not
so
easily
spare
her
wonted
as
her
master
and
mistress
had
done
this
did
vex
my
wench
that
could
at
no
time
abide
a
cat
so
sore
that
she
did
swear
loudly
she
would
shew
me
no
more
favour
till
i
had
made
an
end
of
this
cat
so
being
desirous
to
have
her
society
yet
i
devised
how
not
only
to
please
her
but
so
to
avenge
myself
of
the
cat
as
to
have
sport
therein
with
that
i
packed
the
beast
in
a
bag
took
my
host
two
great
which
at
any
time
had
no
love
for
cats
but
were
familiar
with
me
and
the
cat
in
the
sack
to
a
broad
and
pleasant
meadow
and
there
thought
to
have
my
jest
for
i
deemed
since
there
was
no
tree
hard
by
for
the
cat
to
escape
to
that
the
dogs
would
chase
her
up
and
down
for
a
while
on
the
plain
like
a
hare
and
so
would
afford
me
fine
pastime
but
zounds
it
turned
out
for
me
not
only
dogs
luck
as
people
say
but
cats
luck
which
sort
of
luck
few
can
have
known
or
assuredly
long
ago
have
been
made
a
proverb
of
since
the
cat
when
i
did
open
the
bag
seeing
only
an
open
field
and
on
it
her
two
fierce
enemies
and
nothing
high
whereto
she
could
escape
would
not
so
easily
take
the
field
and
so
be
torn
to
pieces
but
betook
herself
to
mine
own
head
as
finding
no
higher
place
and
as
i
sought
to
keep
her
away
my
hat
fell
off
so
the
more
i
tried
to
pull
her
down
the
deeper
she
stuck
in
her
claws
so
as
to
hold
fast
such
a
combat
the
dogs
could
not
endure
to
see
but
joined
the
sport
themselves
and
jumped
up
with
open
jaws
in
front
behind
and
on
either
side
of
me
to
come
at
the
cat
which
yet
would
not
leave
my
head
but
maintained
her
place
by
fastening
of
her
claws
both
in
my
face
and
my
head
as
best
she
could
and
if
she
missed
to
give
the
dogs
a
pat
with
her
glove
of
thorns
be
sure
she
missed
not
me
yet
because
she
did
sometimes
strike
the
dogs
on
the
nose
therefore
they
busied
themselves
to
bring
her
down
with
their
claws
and
in
so
doing
dealt
me
many
a
shrewd
scratch
in
the
face
yea
and
if
i
with
both
hands
strove
to
tear
the
cat
from
her
place
then
would
she
bite
and
scratch
me
to
the
best
of
her
ability
and
thus
was
i
both
by
the
dogs
and
the
cat
at
once
so
attacked
so
mauled
and
so
terribly
handled
that
i
scarce
looked
like
a
man
at
all
and
what
was
worst
of
all
i
must
run
the
risk
that
if
they
so
snapped
at
the
cat
they
might
by
chance
catch
me
by
the
ear
or
nose
and
bite
it
off
my
collar
and
jerkin
were
so
bloody
that
they
were
like
to
a
smith
travise
on
stephen
day
when
the
horses
are
let
blood
nor
could
i
devise
any
means
to
save
myself
from
this
torment
but
at
last
must
cast
myself
on
the
ground
that
the
dogs
might
so
seize
the
cat
unless
i
was
willing
to
allow
my
poll
to
continue
to
be
their
is
true
the
dogs
did
then
kill
the
cat
but
i
had
by
no
means
so
noble
sport
from
this
as
i
had
hoped
but
only
mockery
and
such
a
face
as
now
thou
seest
before
thee
at
which
i
was
so
enraged
that
i
shot
both
dogs
dead
and
did
so
bastinado
my
mistress
that
had
given
me
cause
for
this
trick
that
she
ran
away
from
me
doubtless
because
she
could
no
longer
love
so
horrible
a
mask
a
brief
example
of
that
trade
which
oliver
followed
wherein
he
was
a
master
and
simplicissimus
should
be
a
prentice
fain
would
i
have
laughed
at
this
story
of
oliver
yet
must
show
compassion
only
and
even
as
i
began
to
tell
him
my
history
we
saw
a
coach
come
up
the
road
with
two
outriders
on
that
we
came
down
from
the
and
posted
ourselves
in
a
house
that
stood
by
the
wayside
and
was
very
convenient
for
the
waylaying
of
passengers
i
must
keep
my
loaded
piece
in
reserve
but
oliver
with
one
shot
brought
down
at
once
one
rider
and
his
horse
before
they
were
ware
of
us
upon
which
the
other
forthwith
fled
and
while
i
with
my
piece
cocked
made
the
coachman
halt
and
descend
oliver
leapt
upon
him
and
with
his
broad
sword
did
cleave
his
head
to
the
teeth
yea
and
would
thereafter
have
butchered
the
lady
and
the
children
that
sat
in
the
carriage
and
already
looked
more
like
dead
folk
than
live
ones
but
i
roundly
said
that
i
would
not
have
but
told
him
if
he
would
do
such
a
deed
he
must
first
slay
me
ah
says
he
thou
foolish
simplicissimus
i
had
never
believed
thou
wert
so
wicked
a
fellow
as
thou
dost
seem
but
brother
said
i
what
hast
thou
against
these
innocents
an
they
were
men
that
could
defend
themselves
another
story
how
he
answered
cook
your
eggs
and
there
will
be
no
chickens
hatched
i
know
these
young
cockatrices
well
their
father
the
major
is
a
proper
skinflint
and
the
worst
in
the
world
and
with
such
words
he
would
have
gone
on
to
slay
them
yet
i
restrained
him
so
long
that
in
the
end
i
softened
him
and
was
a
major
wife
her
maids
and
three
fair
children
for
whom
it
grieved
me
much
these
we
shut
up
in
a
cellar
that
they
might
not
too
soon
betray
us
in
which
they
had
nothing
to
eat
but
fruit
and
turnips
till
they
might
chance
to
be
released
by
some
one
thereafter
we
plundered
the
coach
and
rode
off
with
seven
fine
horses
into
the
wood
where
it
was
thickest
so
when
we
had
tied
them
up
and
i
had
looked
round
me
a
little
i
was
ware
of
a
fellow
that
stood
by
a
tree
not
far
off
him
i
pointed
out
to
oliver
and
said
well
to
be
on
our
guard
why
thou
fool
said
he
is
a
jew
that
i
did
tie
up
there
but
the
rogue
is
long
ago
frozen
and
dead
so
he
goes
up
to
him
and
chucks
him
under
the
chin
and
says
he
aha
thou
dog
thou
didst
bring
me
many
a
fair
ducat
and
as
he
so
shook
his
chin
there
rolled
out
of
his
mouth
a
few
doubloons
that
the
poor
rogue
had
rescued
even
in
the
hour
of
death
at
that
oliver
put
his
hand
in
his
mouth
and
brought
out
twelve
doubloons
and
a
ruby
of
great
price
and
says
he
this
booty
have
i
to
thank
thee
for
simplicissimus
and
with
that
gave
me
the
ruby
took
the
gold
himself
and
went
off
to
fetch
the
peasant
bidding
me
in
the
meanwhile
to
stay
by
the
horses
and
beware
lest
the
dead
jew
should
bite
me
whereby
he
meant
i
had
no
such
courage
as
himself
but
he
being
gone
to
fetch
his
peasant
i
had
heavy
thoughts
and
did
consider
in
what
a
dangerous
state
i
now
lived
and
first
i
thought
i
would
mount
one
of
the
horses
and
escape
yet
did
i
fear
lest
oliver
should
catch
me
in
the
act
and
shoot
me
for
i
had
my
suspicion
that
he
did
but
try
my
good
faith
for
this
once
and
so
stood
near
by
to
watch
me
again
i
thought
to
run
away
on
foot
but
then
must
fear
even
if
i
should
give
oliver
the
slip
that
i
should
not
escape
from
the
peasants
of
the
black
forest
which
were
then
famous
for
the
knocking
of
soldiers
on
the
head
and
suppose
said
i
thou
takest
all
the
horses
with
thee
so
that
oliver
shall
have
no
means
to
pursue
thee
yet
if
thou
be
caught
by
the
troops
of
weimar
thou
wilt
as
a
convicted
murderer
be
broken
on
the
wheel
in
a
word
i
could
devise
no
safe
means
for
my
flight
and
chiefly
because
i
was
there
in
a
desolate
forest
where
i
knew
neither
highway
nor
and
besides
all
that
my
conscience
was
now
awake
and
did
torment
me
because
i
had
stopped
the
coach
and
had
been
the
cause
that
the
driver
had
so
miserably
lost
his
life
and
both
the
ladies
with
the
innocent
children
had
been
laid
fast
in
the
cellar
wherein
perchance
like
this
jew
they
must
perish
and
die
then
again
i
would
comfort
me
on
the
score
of
mine
innocence
as
being
compelled
against
my
will
yet
there
contrariwise
my
conscience
answered
me
i
had
long
before
deserved
for
my
rogueries
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
justice
in
the
company
of
this
and
so
receive
my
due
reward
and
perhaps
methought
just
heaven
had
so
provided
that
i
should
even
so
be
brought
to
book
at
the
last
i
began
to
hope
for
better
things
and
besought
god
goodness
to
help
me
forth
from
this
plight
and
being
in
so
pious
a
mood
i
said
to
myself
thou
fool
thou
art
neither
imprisoned
nor
fettered
the
whole
wide
world
stands
open
before
thee
hast
thou
not
horses
enough
to
take
to
flight
or
if
thou
wilt
not
ride
yet
are
thy
feet
swift
enough
to
save
thee
but
as
i
thus
plagued
and
tormented
myself
and
yet
could
come
to
no
plan
came
oliver
back
with
our
peasant
which
guided
us
with
the
horses
to
another
farm
where
we
did
bait
and
taking
turn
by
turn
did
each
get
two
hours
sleep
after
midnight
we
rode
on
and
about
noon
came
to
the
uttermost
boundary
of
the
switzers
where
oliver
was
well
known
and
had
us
nobly
entertained
and
while
we
made
merry
the
host
sends
for
a
couple
of
jews
that
bought
the
horses
from
us
at
half
their
price
and
all
was
so
plainly
and
clearly
settled
that
there
was
little
need
of
parley
for
the
jews
chief
question
was
were
the
horses
from
the
emperor
side
or
the
swedes
and
thereupon
hearing
they
were
from
weimar
army
then
said
they
must
we
ride
them
not
to
basel
but
into
swabia
to
the
bavarians
at
which
close
acquaintance
and
familiarity
i
must
needs
wonder
so
we
feasted
like
princes
and
heartily
did
i
enjoy
the
good
and
the
savoury
crayfish
and
when
was
evening
we
took
to
the
road
again
loading
our
peasant
with
baked
meats
and
other
victual
like
a
with
all
which
we
came
the
next
day
to
a
lonesome
farm
where
we
were
friendly
welcomed
and
entertained
and
by
reason
of
ill
weather
stayed
two
days
thereafter
through
woods
and
we
came
to
that
very
hut
whither
oliver
did
take
me
when
first
he
had
me
to
his
companion
how
oliver
bit
the
dust
and
took
six
good
men
with
him
so
as
we
sat
down
to
refresh
our
bodies
and
to
rest
oliver
sent
the
peasant
out
to
buy
food
and
also
powder
and
shot
he
being
gone
he
takes
off
his
coat
and
says
he
brother
i
can
no
longer
carry
this
devils
money
about
with
me
alone
and
with
that
unbound
a
pair
of
bags
like
sausages
that
he
wore
on
his
naked
body
threw
them
on
the
table
and
went
on
of
these
thou
must
take
care
till
i
come
to
my
holidays
and
we
both
have
enough
for
the
accursed
stuff
hath
worked
sores
upon
my
body
so
that
i
can
no
longer
carry
it
i
answered
brother
hadst
thou
as
little
as
i
not
gall
thee
but
he
cut
me
short
how
says
he
what
is
mine
is
also
thine
and
what
we
do
further
win
shall
be
so
i
took
up
the
two
sausages
and
found
they
were
indeed
mighty
heavy
being
gold
pieces
only
then
i
told
him
was
all
and
an
he
would
i
would
so
sew
the
money
in
that
it
should
not
vex
him
half
so
much
in
the
carrying
and
when
he
agreed
to
this
he
had
me
with
him
to
a
hollow
tree
wherein
he
had
scissors
needles
and
thread
and
there
i
made
for
him
and
me
a
pair
of
knapsacks
out
of
a
pair
of
breeches
and
many
a
fine
red
penny
i
sewed
therein
so
having
put
the
same
on
under
our
shirts
was
as
if
we
had
golden
armour
behind
and
before
by
means
of
which
we
were
become
if
not
proof
against
bullets
yet
against
swords
then
did
i
wonder
why
he
kept
no
silver
coin
to
which
he
answered
he
had
more
than
a
thousand
thalers
lying
in
a
tree
from
which
he
allowed
the
peasant
to
buy
victuals
and
never
asked
for
a
reckoning
as
not
greatly
valuing
such
trash
this
done
and
the
money
packed
away
we
went
to
our
hut
and
there
cooked
our
food
and
warmed
ourselves
by
the
stove
all
night
and
thither
at
one
of
the
day
when
we
did
least
expect
it
came
six
musqueteers
with
a
corporal
to
our
hut
with
their
pieces
ready
and
their
matches
burning
who
burst
in
the
door
and
cried
to
us
to
surrender
but
oliver
that
like
me
had
ever
his
loaded
piece
lying
by
him
and
his
sharp
sword
also
and
then
sat
behind
the
table
and
i
by
the
stove
behind
the
door
answered
them
with
a
couple
of
wherewith
he
brought
two
to
the
ground
while
i
with
a
like
shot
slew
one
and
wounded
the
fourth
then
oliver
whipped
out
his
terrible
sword
that
could
cut
hairs
asunder
and
might
well
be
compared
to
caliburn
the
sword
of
king
arthur
of
england
and
therewith
he
clove
the
fifth
man
from
the
shoulder
to
the
belly
so
that
his
bowels
gushed
out
and
he
himself
fell
down
beside
them
in
gruesome
fashion
and
meanwhile
i
knocked
the
sixth
man
on
the
head
with
the
of
my
piece
so
that
he
fell
lifeless
but
oliver
got
even
such
a
blow
from
the
seventh
and
that
with
such
force
that
his
brains
flew
out
and
i
in
turn
dealt
him
that
did
that
such
a
crack
that
he
must
needs
join
his
comrades
on
the
dead
so
when
the
one
that
i
had
shot
at
and
wounded
was
ware
of
such
cuffs
and
saw
that
i
made
for
him
with
the
butt
of
my
piece
also
he
threw
away
his
gun
and
began
to
run
as
if
the
devil
was
at
his
heels
yet
all
this
fight
lasted
no
longer
than
one
could
say
a
paternoster
in
which
brief
space
seven
brave
soldiers
did
bite
the
dust
now
when
i
thus
found
myself
master
of
the
field
i
examined
oliver
to
see
if
he
had
a
breath
left
in
him
but
finding
him
quite
dead
methought
was
folly
to
leave
so
much
money
on
a
corpse
that
could
not
need
it
and
so
i
stripped
him
of
his
golden
fleece
that
i
had
made
but
yesterday
and
hung
it
round
my
neck
with
the
other
and
having
broken
mine
own
gun
i
took
oliver
musquet
and
sharp
to
myself
wherewith
i
provided
me
against
all
chances
and
so
away
i
went
and
that
by
the
road
by
which
i
knew
our
peasant
must
return
and
sitting
down
by
the
wayside
i
waited
for
him
and
further
considered
what
i
should
now
do
how
simplicissimus
became
a
rich
man
and
herzbruder
fell
into
great
misery
now
i
sat
but
half
an
hour
in
thought
when
there
comes
to
me
our
peasant
puffing
like
a
bear
and
running
with
all
his
might
was
not
ware
of
me
till
i
had
him
fast
and
why
so
fast
says
i
what
news
quick
he
answered
away
with
ye
for
here
cometh
a
corporal
with
six
musqueteers
that
are
to
seize
you
and
oliver
and
bring
you
to
liechteneck
dead
or
alive
they
took
me
and
would
have
it
i
should
lead
them
to
you
yet
am
i
luckily
escaped
and
come
hither
to
warn
ye
o
villain
thought
i
thou
hast
betrayed
us
to
get
oliver
money
that
lieth
in
the
tree
yet
of
this
i
let
him
mark
nothing
for
i
would
have
him
to
shew
me
the
way
but
told
him
both
oliver
and
they
that
should
take
him
were
dead
which
when
he
would
not
believe
i
was
good
enough
to
go
with
him
that
he
might
see
the
miserable
sight
of
the
seven
bodies
and
says
i
the
seventh
of
them
that
should
take
us
i
let
go
and
would
to
god
i
could
bring
these
to
life
again
for
i
would
not
fail
to
do
it
at
that
the
peasant
was
amazed
with
fear
and
asked
what
plan
have
ye
now
why
quoth
i
the
plan
is
already
resolved
on
for
i
give
thee
the
choice
of
three
things
either
lead
me
by
safe
through
the
wood
to
villingen
or
shew
me
oliver
money
that
lieth
in
the
tree
or
die
here
and
keep
these
dead
men
company
an
thou
bringest
me
to
villingen
thou
hast
oliver
money
for
thyself
alone
if
thou
wilt
shew
it
me
i
will
share
it
with
thee
but
if
thou
wilt
do
neither
i
shoot
thee
dead
and
go
my
way
then
would
he
fain
have
made
off
but
feared
the
musquet
and
so
fell
on
his
knees
and
offered
to
guide
me
through
the
wood
so
we
started
in
haste
and
walked
the
whole
of
that
day
and
the
next
night
which
was
by
great
good
luck
a
very
bright
one
without
food
or
drink
or
rest
of
any
kind
till
towards
daybreak
we
saw
the
town
of
villingen
lie
before
us
and
there
i
let
my
peasant
go
and
what
supported
us
in
this
long
journey
was
for
the
peasant
the
fear
of
death
and
for
me
the
desire
to
escape
myself
and
my
money
yea
i
do
wellnigh
believe
that
gold
lendeth
a
man
strength
for
though
i
carried
a
heavy
enough
load
of
it
yet
i
felt
no
especial
weariness
i
held
it
for
a
lucky
omen
that
even
as
i
came
to
the
gates
of
villingen
they
were
being
opened
where
the
officer
of
the
watch
examined
me
and
hearing
that
i
gave
myself
out
to
be
a
volunteer
trooper
of
that
regiment
to
which
herzbruder
had
appointed
me
when
he
released
me
from
my
musquet
at
philippsburg
and
also
said
that
i
had
escaped
from
weimar
camp
before
breisach
by
whose
men
i
had
been
captured
at
wittenweier
and
made
to
serve
among
them
and
that
i
now
desired
to
come
to
my
regiment
among
the
bavarians
he
gave
me
in
charge
to
a
musqueteer
who
led
me
to
the
commandant
the
same
was
yet
asleep
for
he
had
spent
half
the
night
awake
about
his
affairs
so
that
i
must
wait
a
full
hour
and
a
half
before
his
quarters
and
because
the
folk
just
then
came
from
early
mass
i
had
a
crowd
of
citizens
and
soldiers
around
me
that
would
all
know
how
matters
stood
before
breisach
at
which
clamour
the
commandant
awoke
and
without
further
delay
had
me
brought
to
him
then
began
he
to
examine
me
and
i
said
even
as
i
did
at
the
gate
whereupon
he
asked
me
of
certain
particularities
of
the
siege
and
so
forth
and
at
that
i
confessed
all
namely
how
i
had
spent
some
few
days
with
a
fellow
that
had
also
escaped
and
with
him
had
attacked
and
plundered
a
coach
with
intent
to
get
so
much
booty
from
people
that
we
could
get
us
horses
and
so
properly
equipped
could
come
to
our
regiments
again
but
yesterday
we
had
been
attacked
unawares
by
a
corporal
and
six
other
fellows
that
would
have
taken
us
whereby
my
comrade
had
been
left
dead
on
the
field
with
six
of
the
enemy
while
the
seventh
as
well
as
i
had
escaped
but
he
to
his
own
party
but
of
the
rest
namely
how
i
would
have
come
to
my
wife
at
lippstadt
and
how
i
had
two
such
breast
and
of
that
i
said
no
word
and
made
no
scruple
to
conceal
it
for
what
did
it
concern
him
nor
did
he
ask
me
of
it
at
all
but
much
more
was
amazed
and
would
hardly
believe
that
oliver
and
i
had
killed
six
men
and
put
the
seventh
to
flight
even
though
my
comrade
had
paid
with
his
life
so
as
we
talked
there
was
occasion
to
speak
of
oliver
wonderful
sword
that
i
had
by
my
side
which
pleased
him
so
well
that
if
i
would
part
civilly
from
him
and
get
a
pass
i
must
hand
it
over
to
him
in
return
for
another
that
he
gave
me
and
in
truth
it
was
a
fine
and
beautiful
blade
with
a
perpetual
calendar
engraved
thereupon
nor
shall
any
persuade
me
was
not
forged
by
vulcan
hora
and
altogether
so
prepared
as
is
told
of
that
sword
in
the
heldenbuch
by
which
all
other
swords
are
cleft
asunder
and
the
most
courageous
and
foes
are
put
to
flight
like
fearful
hares
so
when
he
had
dismissed
me
and
commanded
to
give
me
a
pass
i
went
the
nearest
way
to
an
inn
and
knew
not
whether
i
should
first
eat
or
sleep
for
i
needed
both
yet
would
i
sooner
appease
my
belly
and
so
commanded
meat
and
drink
and
considered
how
i
should
lay
my
plans
to
come
in
safety
to
my
wife
at
lippstadt
with
my
money
for
i
was
as
little
minded
to
go
to
my
regiment
as
to
break
my
neck
but
while
i
so
speculated
and
mused
of
one
and
another
cunning
device
there
limped
into
the
room
a
fellow
with
a
stick
in
his
hand
his
head
bound
up
one
arm
in
a
sling
and
clothes
so
poor
that
i
would
have
given
him
not
a
penny
for
them
and
so
soon
as
the
drawer
was
ware
of
him
he
would
have
cast
him
forth
for
he
smelt
vilely
and
was
so
full
of
lice
that
a
man
could
have
garrisoned
the
whole
swabian
heath
with
them
yet
he
prayed
he
might
but
be
allowed
to
warm
himself
which
yet
was
not
granted
but
i
taking
pity
on
him
and
interceding
for
him
with
difficulty
he
was
let
to
come
to
the
stove
and
there
he
looked
upon
me
as
i
thought
with
a
curious
longing
and
a
great
attention
to
my
drinking
and
uttered
many
sighs
so
when
the
drawer
went
to
fetch
me
a
dish
of
meat
he
came
to
me
at
my
table
and
held
out
an
earthen
so
that
i
might
well
understand
what
he
would
have
so
i
took
the
can
and
filled
up
his
little
pot
for
him
before
he
asked
but
o
friend
says
he
for
herzbruder
sake
give
me
somewhat
to
eat
also
which
when
he
said
it
cut
me
to
the
heart
for
well
i
saw
it
was
herzbruder
himself
then
had
i
nearly
swooned
to
see
him
in
so
evil
a
plight
yet
i
recovered
myself
and
fell
upon
his
neck
and
set
him
by
me
where
the
tears
did
gush
from
our
eyes
his
for
joy
and
mine
for
pity
of
the
manner
in
which
herzbruder
fell
into
such
evil
plight
now
by
reason
of
the
suddenness
of
this
our
meeting
we
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
but
only
ask
one
of
the
other
how
it
had
fared
with
each
since
we
had
last
met
yet
as
the
host
and
the
drawer
went
ever
in
and
out
we
could
have
no
private
discourse
and
the
host
marvelling
that
i
could
suffer
so
lousy
a
companion
by
me
i
told
him
that
in
time
of
war
such
was
the
custom
among
good
soldiers
that
were
comrades
and
when
i
understood
further
how
herzbruder
had
till
now
been
in
the
spital
and
there
had
been
supported
by
alms
and
his
wounds
but
sorrily
bound
up
i
hired
of
the
host
a
separate
chamber
put
herzbruder
to
bed
and
sent
for
the
best
surgeon
i
could
find
besides
a
tailor
and
a
sempstress
to
clothe
him
and
to
rid
him
of
his
lice
and
having
in
my
purse
those
same
doubloons
that
oliver
had
fetched
out
of
the
dead
jew
mouth
i
cast
them
on
the
table
and
says
i
to
herzbruder
in
the
hearing
see
brother
there
is
my
money
that
will
i
spend
on
thee
and
consume
with
thee
so
with
that
the
host
entertained
us
nobly
but
to
the
surgeon
i
showed
the
ruby
that
had
belonged
to
the
said
jew
and
was
worth
some
thalers
and
told
him
that
as
i
purposed
to
spend
such
small
moneys
as
i
had
for
our
food
and
for
the
clothing
of
my
comrade
therefore
i
would
give
him
that
ring
if
he
would
quickly
and
thoroughly
cure
my
said
comrade
with
which
he
was
content
and
bestowed
his
best
care
upon
that
cure
and
so
i
tended
herzbruder
like
my
second
self
and
caused
a
modest
suit
of
grey
cloth
to
be
made
for
him
but
first
i
went
to
the
commandant
for
my
pass
and
told
him
how
i
had
met
a
comrade
sorely
wounded
for
him
i
would
wait
till
he
was
sound
for
were
i
to
leave
him
behind
me
i
could
not
answer
for
it
to
my
regiment
which
intention
the
commandant
approved
and
allowed
me
to
stay
as
long
as
i
listed
with
the
further
offer
that
when
my
comrade
could
follow
me
he
would
provide
us
both
with
sufficient
passes
then
coming
back
to
herzbruder
and
sitting
by
his
bed
alone
i
begged
him
he
would
freely
tell
me
how
he
had
come
into
so
evil
a
plight
for
i
thought
he
might
perchance
have
been
driven
from
his
former
place
for
weighty
reasons
or
for
some
fault
and
so
degraded
and
brought
to
his
present
evil
case
but
brother
said
he
thou
knowest
that
i
was
the
count
of
götz
his
factotum
and
dearest
intimate
friend
on
hand
thou
knowest
well
how
evil
an
end
this
last
campaign
hath
come
to
under
his
generalship
and
command
wherein
we
not
only
lost
the
battle
of
wittenweier
but
did
also
fail
to
raise
the
siege
of
breisach
seeing
then
that
on
this
account
all
manner
of
rumours
be
afloat
and
that
most
unfair
ones
and
in
especial
now
that
the
said
count
is
cited
to
vienna
to
justify
himself
therefore
for
fear
and
shame
i
do
willingly
live
in
this
humble
plight
and
often
do
wish
either
to
die
in
this
misery
or
at
least
so
long
to
lie
concealed
till
the
said
count
shall
have
proved
his
innocence
for
so
far
as
i
know
he
was
at
all
times
true
to
the
roman
emperor
and
that
in
this
set
year
he
hath
had
no
good
luck
is
in
my
opinion
more
to
be
ascribed
to
the
providence
of
god
who
giveth
victory
to
whom
he
will
than
to
the
count
his
neglectfulness
now
when
we
were
to
relieve
breisach
and
i
saw
that
on
our
side
all
was
done
so
sleepily
i
armed
mine
own
self
and
marched
forth
with
the
rest
upon
the
bridge
of
boats
as
if
i
in
person
were
to
finish
the
business
which
was
neither
my
profession
nor
my
duty
yet
i
did
it
for
an
example
to
others
because
we
had
accomplished
so
little
that
summer
then
past
but
luck
or
would
so
have
it
that
i
being
among
the
first
to
sally
forth
was
also
among
the
first
to
look
the
enemy
in
the
face
upon
the
bridge
where
was
a
sharp
encounter
and
as
i
had
been
foremost
in
attack
so
when
we
gave
way
before
the
furious
charge
of
the
french
i
was
the
last
to
retreat
and
so
fell
into
the
hands
and
there
did
i
receive
a
bullet
in
the
right
arm
and
another
in
the
leg
so
that
i
could
neither
run
nor
hold
a
sword
and
as
the
straitness
of
the
place
and
the
desperateness
of
the
action
allowed
no
talk
of
giving
or
taking
of
quarter
i
got
me
a
crack
on
the
head
which
brought
me
to
the
ground
and
there
being
finely
clad
i
was
by
some
stripped
and
in
the
confusion
thrown
into
the
rhine
for
dead
in
which
sore
strait
i
called
to
god
for
help
and
left
myself
to
his
good
pleasure
and
while
i
offered
up
my
prayers
i
found
his
help
at
hand
for
the
rhine
did
cast
me
up
on
land
where
i
did
staunch
my
wounds
with
moss
and
though
in
so
doing
i
was
nigh
frozen
yet
i
found
in
me
a
special
strength
to
creep
from
thence
for
god
helped
me
so
that
i
though
miserably
wounded
came
to
certain
and
soldiers
wives
that
one
and
all
had
compassion
on
me
though
they
knew
me
not
yet
all
already
despaired
of
the
relief
of
that
fortress
and
that
did
hurt
me
more
than
all
my
wounds
but
they
refreshed
and
clothed
me
by
their
fire
and
before
i
could
even
bandage
up
my
wounds
i
must
behold
how
our
people
prepared
for
a
shameful
retreat
and
gave
up
our
cause
as
lost
which
caused
me
dreadful
pain
and
for
that
reason
i
resolved
to
make
myself
known
to
none
and
so
not
to
make
myself
a
mark
for
mockery
wherefore
i
joined
myself
to
certain
wounded
men
of
our
army
that
had
their
own
surgeon
with
them
to
him
i
gave
a
golden
cross
that
i
still
had
about
my
neck
for
which
he
bound
up
my
wounds
so
as
to
last
till
now
and
in
such
poor
plight
my
good
simplicissimus
have
i
made
shift
so
far
and
am
minded
to
reveal
to
no
man
who
i
am
till
i
see
how
the
count
of
götz
his
affair
will
turn
out
and
now
that
i
see
thy
goodness
and
faith
it
breedeth
in
me
great
comfort
that
the
good
god
hath
not
forsaken
me
for
this
very
morning
when
i
came
from
early
mass
and
saw
thee
stand
before
the
quarters
i
did
fancy
that
god
had
sent
thee
to
me
in
shape
of
an
angel
to
help
me
in
my
need
so
i
did
comfort
him
as
best
i
could
and
secretly
told
him
i
had
yet
more
money
than
those
doubloons
that
he
had
seen
and
that
all
was
at
his
service
therewith
i
also
told
him
of
oliver
end
and
how
i
had
perforce
avenged
his
death
which
so
enlivened
his
spirits
that
it
also
helped
his
body
in
such
wise
that
every
day
he
grew
better
of
his
wounds
book
v
how
simplicissimus
turned
palmer
and
went
on
a
pilgrimage
with
herzbruder
now
herzbruder
being
wholly
restored
and
healed
of
his
wounds
he
told
me
in
secret
he
had
in
his
greatest
need
made
a
vow
to
go
on
a
pilgrimage
to
einsiedeln
and
since
in
any
case
he
was
now
so
near
to
switzerland
he
would
perform
the
same
though
he
must
beg
his
way
thither
this
was
pleasant
hearing
for
me
so
i
offered
him
my
money
and
my
company
yea
and
would
buy
a
couple
of
nags
to
do
the
journey
upon
not
indeed
for
the
reason
that
religion
urged
me
thereto
but
rather
to
see
the
confederates
country
as
the
one
land
wherein
sacred
peace
yet
flourished
so
i
rejoiced
much
to
have
the
opportunity
to
serve
herzbruder
on
such
a
journey
seeing
that
i
loved
him
almost
more
than
myself
yet
he
refused
both
my
help
and
my
company
with
the
excuse
that
his
pilgrimage
must
be
performed
on
foot
and
with
peas
in
his
shoes
and
should
i
be
in
his
company
not
only
should
i
hinder
him
in
his
pious
thoughts
but
should
also
bring
on
myself
great
discomfort
by
reason
of
his
slow
going
all
which
he
said
to
be
rid
of
me
because
he
did
scruple
on
so
holy
a
journey
to
spend
money
that
had
been
gained
by
robbery
and
murder
besides
he
would
not
put
me
to
too
great
expense
and
said
openly
that
i
had
already
done
more
for
him
than
i
owed
him
or
he
could
hope
to
repay
upon
which
we
fell
into
a
friendly
dispute
which
same
was
so
pleasant
a
quarrel
that
i
have
never
heard
the
like
for
we
talked
of
nothing
but
this
that
each
one
said
he
had
not
yet
done
for
his
fellow
so
much
as
one
friend
should
for
another
nay
was
yet
far
from
making
up
for
the
benefits
he
had
received
yet
all
this
would
not
move
him
to
take
me
for
a
companion
till
i
perceived
that
he
had
a
disgust
both
at
oliver
money
and
mine
own
godless
life
therefore
i
made
shift
with
a
lie
and
persuaded
him
that
my
intent
to
reform
my
life
did
move
me
to
go
to
einsiedeln
and
should
he
hinder
me
from
so
good
a
work
and
i
thereupon
should
die
he
should
hardly
answer
for
it
by
which
i
persuaded
him
to
suffer
me
to
visit
that
holy
place
with
him
especially
since
i
though
was
all
lies
made
an
appearance
of
great
penitence
for
my
wicked
life
and
moreover
did
persuade
him
i
had
laid
on
myself
a
penance
to
go
to
einsiedeln
on
peas
even
as
he
but
this
quarrel
was
scarce
over
ere
we
fell
into
another
for
herzbruder
was
too
full
of
scruples
and
hardly
would
he
suffer
me
to
use
the
commandant
pass
because
was
made
out
for
me
to
go
to
my
regiment
how
now
said
he
is
it
not
our
intent
to
better
our
lives
and
to
go
to
einsiedeln
and
now
see
in
heaven
name
wilt
thou
make
a
beginning
with
deceit
and
blind
men
eyes
with
falsehood
that
denieth
me
before
the
world
him
will
i
deny
before
my
heavenly
father
saith
christ
what
cowards
be
we
if
all
christ
martyrs
and
confessors
had
done
the
same
there
would
be
few
saints
in
heaven
let
us
go
in
god
name
and
under
his
protection
whither
our
holy
intent
and
desires
lead
us
and
let
god
contrive
for
us
the
rest
for
so
will
he
bring
us
in
safety
where
our
souls
shall
find
peace
but
when
i
set
before
him
how
man
should
not
tempt
god
but
suit
himself
to
the
times
and
use
such
means
as
could
not
be
done
without
and
specially
because
to
go
on
pilgrimage
was
an
unwonted
thing
for
the
soldatesca
so
that
if
we
revealed
our
purpose
we
should
be
accounted
rather
deserters
than
pilgrims
which
might
bring
us
great
trouble
and
danger
and
chiefly
how
the
holy
apostle
paul
to
whom
we
could
not
compare
ourselves
had
wonderfully
suited
himself
to
the
times
and
needs
of
this
world
at
the
last
he
consented
that
i
should
get
a
pass
to
go
to
my
regiment
with
this
we
passed
out
of
the
town
at
the
shutting
of
the
gates
with
a
trusty
guide
as
we
would
go
to
rotweil
but
turned
off
short
by
a
and
came
the
same
night
over
the
switzers
boundary
and
next
morning
to
a
village
where
we
equipped
ourselves
with
long
black
cloaks
pilgrims
staves
and
rosaries
and
sent
our
guide
home
with
a
good
wage
and
here
in
comparison
with
other
german
lands
the
country
seemed
to
me
as
strange
as
if
i
had
been
in
brazil
or
china
i
saw
how
the
people
did
trade
and
traffic
in
peace
how
the
stalls
were
full
of
cattle
and
the
farmyards
crowded
with
fowls
geese
and
ducks
the
roads
were
used
in
safety
by
travellers
and
the
inns
were
full
of
people
making
merry
there
was
no
fear
of
an
enemy
no
dread
of
plundering
and
no
terror
of
losing
goods
and
life
and
limb
each
man
lived
under
his
own
vine
and
and
that
moreover
in
comparison
with
other
german
lands
in
joy
and
delight
so
that
i
held
this
land
for
an
earthly
paradise
though
by
nature
it
seemed
rough
as
might
be
so
it
came
about
that
all
along
the
road
i
did
but
gape
at
this
and
that
whereas
herzbruder
was
praying
on
his
rosary
for
which
i
earned
many
a
reproof
from
him
for
he
would
have
it
i
should
pray
without
ceasing
to
which
i
could
not
accustom
myself
but
at
zurich
he
found
me
out
and
told
me
the
truth
as
tartly
as
might
be
for
having
rested
the
night
at
schaffhausen
where
the
peas
did
mightily
gall
my
feet
and
i
fearing
to
walk
upon
them
next
day
i
had
them
boiled
and
put
into
my
shoes
again
and
so
came
happily
to
zurich
while
he
found
himself
in
sorry
plight
and
said
to
me
brother
thou
hast
great
favour
of
god
that
notwithstanding
the
peas
in
thy
shoes
thou
canst
walk
so
well
yea
said
i
dear
herzbruder
but
i
did
boil
them
or
i
had
not
been
able
so
far
to
walk
upon
them
says
he
what
hast
done
thou
hadst
better
have
put
them
out
of
thy
shoes
if
thou
didst
but
act
a
mockery
with
them
i
fear
me
lest
god
punish
thee
and
me
alike
take
it
not
evil
of
me
brother
if
i
of
brotherly
love
do
tell
thee
in
plain
german
what
i
have
at
heart
namely
this
that
i
fear
unless
thou
dealest
otherwise
with
god
thine
eternal
salvation
standeth
in
jeopardy
i
do
assure
thee
i
love
no
man
more
than
thee
yet
i
deny
not
that
if
thou
betterest
not
thyself
i
must
scruple
to
bear
such
love
to
thee
further
at
which
i
was
struck
so
dumb
with
fear
that
i
could
not
at
all
recover
myself
but
freely
confessed
to
him
i
had
put
the
peas
in
my
shoes
not
for
piety
but
to
please
him
that
he
might
take
me
with
him
on
his
journey
ah
brother
quoth
he
i
see
thou
art
far
from
the
way
of
salvation
peas
or
no
peas
god
give
thee
a
better
mind
for
without
such
can
not
our
friendship
endure
from
that
time
forward
i
followed
him
sorrowfully
as
one
going
to
the
gallows
for
my
conscience
began
to
smite
me
and
as
i
reflected
on
all
manner
of
things
all
the
tricks
i
had
played
in
my
life
did
pass
before
mine
eyes
and
first
i
lamented
that
my
lost
innocence
that
i
had
brought
out
from
the
forest
and
in
the
world
had
in
so
many
ways
forfeited
and
what
increased
my
trouble
was
this
that
herzbruder
spake
now
but
little
with
me
and
looked
not
upon
me
save
with
sighs
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
he
were
certain
of
my
damnation
and
lamented
it
how
simplicissimus
being
terrified
of
the
devil
was
converted
in
such
fashion
we
came
even
to
einsiedeln
and
so
into
the
church
even
as
the
priest
was
casting
out
an
evil
spirit
which
was
to
me
a
new
and
strange
sight
wherefore
i
left
herzbruder
to
kneel
and
pray
as
much
as
he
listed
and
went
off
from
curiosity
to
see
such
a
spectacle
but
hardly
had
i
drawn
nigh
when
the
evil
spirit
cried
out
of
the
poor
man
oho
rascal
doth
send
thee
hither
i
did
think
to
find
thee
with
oliver
in
our
hellish
abode
when
i
should
return
and
now
i
see
thou
art
to
be
found
here
thou
adulterous
murderous
whoremonger
canst
thou
think
to
escape
us
o
ye
priests
have
naught
to
do
with
him
he
is
a
worse
hypocrite
and
liar
than
i
he
doth
but
mock
and
make
a
jest
of
god
and
religion
thereupon
the
exorcist
commanded
the
spirit
to
be
silent
for
none
would
believe
him
as
being
an
yes
yes
he
answered
ask
this
runagate
monk
companion
and
he
can
well
tell
you
that
this
atheist
is
not
afraid
to
boil
the
peas
upon
which
he
vowed
to
travel
hither
upon
which
i
knew
not
whether
i
stood
on
my
head
or
my
heels
hearing
all
this
and
all
men
staring
upon
me
but
the
priest
rebuked
the
spirit
and
bade
him
be
silent
yet
would
not
that
day
cast
him
out
in
the
meanwhile
came
herzbruder
even
as
i
looked
for
very
terror
more
like
a
dead
than
a
live
man
and
between
hope
and
fear
knew
not
what
to
be
at
so
he
comforted
me
as
best
he
could
assuring
the
bystanders
and
especially
the
good
fathers
that
in
my
life
i
had
never
been
a
monk
but
certainly
a
soldier
that
perhaps
might
have
done
more
evil
than
good
and
added
the
devil
was
a
liar
and
had
made
the
story
of
the
peas
much
worse
than
it
really
was
yet
was
i
so
confounded
in
spirit
that
was
with
me
even
as
if
i
already
felt
the
pains
of
hell
so
that
the
priests
had
much
ado
to
comfort
me
yea
they
bade
me
go
to
confession
and
communion
but
the
spirit
cried
again
out
of
the
man
possessed
yes
yes
he
will
make
a
fine
confession
that
knoweth
not
even
what
confession
is
and
indeed
what
would
ye
have
of
him
for
he
is
of
a
heretic
mind
and
belongeth
to
us
yea
his
parents
were
more
of
anabaptists
than
calvinists
but
at
that
the
exorcist
again
commanded
the
spirit
to
hold
his
peace
and
said
to
him
so
will
it
grieve
thee
the
more
if
this
poor
lost
sheep
be
snatched
out
of
thy
jaws
and
gathered
into
the
fold
of
christ
at
which
the
spirit
began
to
roar
so
fearfully
that
was
terrible
to
hear
yet
in
that
grisly
song
i
found
my
greatest
comfort
for
i
thought
if
i
could
not
again
enjoy
god
favour
the
devil
would
not
take
it
so
now
although
i
was
then
in
no
wise
prepared
for
confession
and
though
in
my
lifetime
it
had
never
come
into
my
thoughts
but
i
had
always
for
mere
shame
feared
it
as
the
devil
fears
holy
water
yet
at
that
moment
i
felt
in
me
such
repentance
for
my
sins
and
such
a
desire
to
do
penance
and
to
lead
a
better
life
that
forthwith
i
asked
for
a
confessor
at
which
sudden
conversion
and
amendment
of
life
herzbruder
rejoiced
greatly
for
he
had
perceived
and
well
knew
that
so
far
i
had
belonged
to
no
religion
thereafter
i
openly
professed
myself
of
the
catholic
church
went
to
confession
and
to
mass
after
absolution
received
with
all
which
i
felt
so
light
and
easy
at
my
heart
that
is
not
to
be
expressed
and
what
is
most
marvellous
is
this
that
the
devil
in
the
possessed
man
henceforward
left
me
in
peace
whereas
before
my
confession
and
absolution
he
cast
up
against
me
certain
knaveries
i
had
committed
with
such
particularities
as
he
had
been
ordained
for
naught
else
but
to
point
out
my
sins
yet
the
hearers
believed
him
not
as
being
a
liar
especially
since
my
honourable
pilgrim
dress
shewed
me
in
another
light
in
this
gracious
place
we
abode
fourteen
days
and
there
i
thanked
god
for
my
conversion
and
marked
the
miracles
that
were
there
done
all
which
did
incite
me
to
some
shew
of
piety
and
godliness
yet
did
the
same
last
but
as
long
as
it
might
for
even
as
my
conversion
took
its
beginning
not
from
love
of
god
but
from
dread
and
fear
of
damnation
so
did
i
by
degrees
become
lukewarm
and
slothful
because
i
little
by
little
forgot
the
terror
that
the
evil
one
had
struck
into
me
so
when
we
had
sufficiently
viewed
the
relics
of
the
saints
the
vestments
and
other
remarkable
things
of
the
abbey
we
betook
ourselves
to
baden
there
to
spend
the
winter
how
the
two
friends
spent
the
winter
there
did
i
hire
a
cheerful
parlour
and
a
chamber
for
us
such
as
the
visitors
to
the
baths
do
commonly
use
to
have
especially
in
summer
which
be
mostly
rich
switzers
that
do
resort
here
more
to
pass
the
time
and
make
a
show
than
to
take
baths
for
any
disease
so
also
i
bargained
for
our
food
and
herzbruder
seeing
how
princely
i
began
counselled
me
frugality
and
reminded
me
of
the
long
hard
winter
that
we
had
yet
to
pass
for
he
dreamt
not
that
my
money
would
hold
out
so
long
and
i
should
need
all
i
had
he
said
for
the
spring
when
we
should
depart
for
much
money
was
soon
spent
if
one
ever
took
from
it
and
never
added
to
it
was
blown
away
like
smoke
and
was
certain
never
to
return
etc
at
such
loyal
counsel
i
could
no
longer
conceal
from
herzbruder
how
rich
my
treasury
was
and
how
i
was
minded
to
spend
it
for
the
good
of
both
of
us
since
its
extraction
and
growth
were
so
unholy
that
i
could
not
think
to
buy
lands
with
it
and
even
if
i
were
not
minded
to
spend
it
so
as
to
maintain
so
my
best
friend
on
earth
yet
it
were
but
right
that
he
herzbruder
should
enjoy
oliver
money
in
revenge
for
the
insult
he
had
before
received
from
him
before
magdeburg
and
when
i
knew
myself
to
be
in
all
safety
i
drew
off
my
two
divided
the
ducats
and
pistoles
and
said
to
herzbruder
he
might
dispose
of
this
money
at
will
and
spend
and
disburse
it
as
he
would
so
that
it
might
best
profit
us
both
when
he
saw
besides
the
greatness
of
my
faith
in
him
how
much
the
money
was
with
which
i
without
him
could
have
been
a
pretty
rich
man
brother
says
he
since
i
have
known
thee
thou
hast
done
naught
but
shew
thy
constant
love
and
truth
to
meward
but
tell
me
how
thinkest
thou
that
i
can
ever
repay
thee
i
speak
not
of
the
money
for
this
perchance
might
in
time
be
repaid
but
of
thy
love
and
faith
and
especially
of
the
exceeding
trust
thou
hast
in
me
which
is
not
to
be
estimated
in
a
word
brother
thy
noble
soul
doth
make
me
thy
slave
and
the
favour
thou
shewest
me
is
more
easy
to
admire
than
to
repay
o
honest
simplicissimus
into
whose
mind
it
never
entereth
even
in
these
godless
days
in
which
the
world
is
full
of
knavery
to
think
how
poor
needy
herzbruder
might
with
this
fair
stock
of
money
make
off
and
in
his
place
leave
thee
in
want
of
a
surety
brother
this
proof
of
true
friendship
bindeth
me
more
to
thee
than
if
a
rich
lord
should
give
me
thousands
only
i
beg
thee
my
brother
remain
master
guardian
and
steward
of
thine
own
money
for
me
is
enough
that
thou
art
my
friend
to
this
i
answered
what
strange
discourses
be
these
my
honoured
herzbruder
ye
give
me
to
understand
ye
are
much
bounden
to
me
and
yet
will
ye
not
see
to
it
that
i
spend
not
my
money
vainly
and
to
your
damage
and
mine
and
so
we
disputed
with
one
another
childishly
enough
because
each
was
drunken
with
love
of
the
other
thus
was
herzbruder
made
at
once
my
steward
my
treasurer
my
servant
and
my
master
and
in
our
time
of
leisure
he
told
me
of
his
life
and
by
what
means
he
was
known
and
promoted
by
count
götz
whereupon
i
told
him
how
i
had
fared
since
his
father
of
pious
memory
died
for
until
then
we
had
never
had
so
much
time
but
when
he
heard
i
had
a
young
wife
in
lippstadt
he
did
reprove
me
that
i
had
not
repaired
to
her
rather
than
with
him
to
switzerland
for
that
had
been
more
fitting
and
was
my
duty
moreover
and
when
i
would
excuse
myself
that
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
leave
him
my
best
friend
in
misery
he
persuaded
me
to
write
to
my
wife
and
tell
her
of
my
condition
with
the
promise
to
visit
her
as
soon
as
might
be
to
that
i
did
add
excuses
for
my
long
absence
namely
all
manner
of
contrarious
happenings
though
greatly
i
had
desired
to
be
with
her
long
ere
now
meanwhile
herzbruder
learning
from
the
public
prints
that
it
stood
well
with
general
count
götz
and
that
in
particular
he
would
succeed
in
his
vindication
before
his
imperial
majesty
would
be
set
free
and
even
again
receive
command
of
an
army
sent
an
account
of
how
he
stood
to
that
general
at
vienna
and
wrote
also
to
the
bavarian
army
on
the
score
of
his
baggage
that
he
had
there
yea
and
began
to
hope
his
fortunes
would
again
flourish
upon
which
we
concluded
to
part
in
the
spring
he
going
to
the
said
count
and
i
to
my
wife
at
lippstadt
yet
not
to
pass
the
winter
in
idleness
we
did
learn
from
an
engineer
to
make
more
fortifications
on
paper
than
the
kings
of
france
and
spain
together
could
build
so
too
i
made
acquaintance
with
certain
alchymists
that
because
they
saw
i
had
money
at
my
back
would
teach
me
to
make
gold
an
i
would
but
bear
the
expense
of
it
yea
and
i
do
believe
they
had
persuaded
me
thereto
had
not
herzbruder
given
them
their
congé
saying
that
he
that
possessed
such
an
art
would
not
need
to
go
about
like
a
beggar
nor
to
ask
others
for
money
but
though
herzbruder
did
receive
from
vienna
a
gracious
answer
from
the
said
count
and
fine
promises
i
heard
no
single
word
from
lippstadt
though
on
several
i
did
write
in
duplicate
which
put
me
in
ill
humour
and
was
the
cause
that
that
spring
i
went
not
to
westphalia
but
obtained
from
herzbruder
that
he
should
take
me
with
him
to
vienna
and
let
me
share
in
his
good
fortune
so
with
my
money
we
equipped
ourselves
like
two
cavaliers
both
in
clothing
horses
servants
and
arms
and
travelled
by
constance
to
ulm
where
we
embarked
upon
the
danube
and
from
thence
in
eight
days
came
safely
to
vienna
in
what
manner
simplicissimus
and
herzbruder
went
to
the
wars
again
and
returned
thence
things
be
strangely
ordered
in
this
changeful
world
is
said
he
that
should
know
all
things
would
soon
be
rich
but
i
say
he
that
always
could
seize
his
opportunity
would
soon
be
great
and
powerful
for
many
a
skinflint
or
both
which
honourable
titles
are
given
to
misers
gets
rich
enough
by
knowing
and
using
some
knack
of
gain
yet
is
he
not
therefore
great
but
is
and
remaineth
always
of
less
estimation
than
when
he
was
poor
but
he
that
can
make
himself
great
and
powerful
him
riches
follow
after
close
so
did
luck
that
is
wont
to
give
power
and
riches
look
on
me
favourably
for
once
and
gave
me
when
i
had
been
some
eight
days
in
vienna
opportunity
in
hand
to
mount
upon
the
rungs
of
fame
without
hindrance
yet
i
did
it
not
and
why
i
hold
was
because
my
fate
had
willed
for
me
another
road
namely
that
along
which
my
foolishness
did
lead
me
for
the
count
von
der
wahl
under
whose
command
i
had
before
made
myself
famous
in
westphalia
was
even
then
in
vienna
when
i
came
thither
with
herzbruder
which
last
was
at
a
banquet
when
divers
imperialist
councillors
of
war
were
present
with
the
count
of
götz
and
others
where
the
talk
was
of
all
manner
of
strange
fellows
soldiers
of
different
qualities
and
famous
partisans
and
there
was
mention
made
of
the
huntsman
of
soest
and
such
famous
exploits
of
him
told
that
some
wondered
at
the
youth
of
the
fellow
and
lamented
that
the
crafty
hessian
colonel
saint
andré
had
hung
a
weight
round
his
neck
so
that
he
must
either
lay
aside
the
sword
or
serve
under
swedish
colours
for
the
said
count
von
der
wahl
had
found
out
all
the
trick
which
the
same
colonel
had
played
me
at
lippstadt
herzbruder
that
was
there
present
and
would
fain
have
forwarded
my
interest
asked
for
indulgence
and
leave
to
speak
and
said
he
knew
that
huntsman
of
soest
better
than
any
man
in
the
world
which
was
not
only
a
good
soldier
that
feared
not
the
smell
of
powder
but
also
a
good
rider
a
perfected
fencer
an
excellent
professor
of
musquetry
and
artillery
and
besides
all
this
one
that
would
yield
place
to
no
engineer
in
the
world
that
he
had
left
not
only
his
wife
that
had
been
so
shamefully
imposed
upon
him
but
all
that
he
had
at
lippstadt
and
again
sought
the
service
and
so
had
in
the
last
campaign
served
under
the
count
of
götz
and
being
then
taken
by
the
troops
of
weimar
and
desiring
to
return
to
the
imperialists
had
with
his
comrade
slain
a
corporal
and
six
musqueteers
that
had
pursued
them
and
would
bring
them
back
and
had
earned
rich
booty
thereby
and
so
had
come
with
him
to
vienna
with
intent
to
offer
his
service
once
more
against
his
imperial
enemies
provided
only
he
could
have
such
terms
as
suited
him
for
as
a
common
soldier
he
would
serve
no
more
by
this
time
the
worshipful
company
were
so
flustered
with
good
liquor
that
they
must
satisfy
their
curiosity
to
see
the
huntsman
to
which
end
herzbruder
was
sent
to
fetch
me
in
a
coach
who
on
the
way
instructed
me
how
i
should
carry
myself
among
these
persons
of
quality
since
my
fortune
in
time
to
come
depended
on
this
so
when
i
came
to
them
at
first
i
answered
all
questions
very
short
and
sententiously
so
that
they
began
to
admire
me
as
one
who
said
nothing
that
had
not
a
prudent
meaning
in
a
word
i
so
presented
myself
that
i
pleased
all
besides
this
that
i
had
from
count
von
wahl
the
reputation
of
a
good
soldier
but
with
all
this
i
got
drunk
and
well
can
i
believe
that
in
that
condition
i
proved
to
all
how
little
i
had
been
at
court
and
this
was
the
end
of
it
all
that
a
colonel
of
foot
promised
me
a
company
in
his
regiment
which
i
refused
not
for
i
thought
to
be
a
captain
is
indeed
no
trifle
yet
herzbruder
next
day
rebuked
me
for
my
folly
and
said
had
i
but
held
out
longer
i
had
risen
to
high
rank
so
was
i
presented
to
a
company
as
their
captain
which
company
although
with
me
was
in
respect
of
officers
fully
staffed
yet
counted
no
more
than
seven
privates
that
could
stand
sentry
besides
my
were
such
old
cripples
that
i
must
needs
scratch
my
head
when
i
looked
upon
them
and
so
it
came
about
that
in
the
next
engagement
which
happened
not
long
after
i
was
with
them
miserably
beaten
in
which
affair
count
von
götz
lost
his
life
and
herzbruder
his
testicles
which
were
shot
away
and
i
had
my
share
in
the
leg
though
but
a
trifling
wound
whereupon
we
betook
ourselves
to
vienna
there
to
be
cured
and
also
because
we
had
there
left
all
our
property
but
besides
these
wounds
which
were
soon
healed
there
appeared
in
herzbruder
other
evil
symptoms
which
the
doctors
could
not
at
first
recognise
for
he
was
paralysed
in
all
his
extremities
like
a
choleric
person
whom
his
gall
doth
plague
to
which
complexion
he
was
no
more
given
than
to
anger
nevertheless
he
was
counselled
to
take
the
waters
and
to
that
end
the
griesbach
in
the
black
forest
was
commended
to
him
and
so
doth
fortune
suddenly
change
for
herzbruder
just
before
had
been
minded
to
marry
a
young
lady
of
quality
and
to
that
end
to
get
him
made
a
freiherr
and
me
a
nobleman
but
now
must
he
make
other
plans
for
having
lost
that
by
which
he
had
meant
to
propagate
his
family
and
being
moreover
threatened
with
a
tedious
sickness
ensuing
upon
that
loss
in
which
he
would
have
need
of
good
friends
he
made
his
will
and
appointed
me
heir
of
all
his
property
the
more
so
because
he
saw
how
for
his
sake
i
cast
my
fortune
to
the
winds
and
gave
up
my
command
that
i
might
bear
him
company
to
the
spa
and
there
wait
on
him
till
he
should
recover
his
health
how
simplicissimus
rode
courier
and
in
the
likeness
of
mercury
learned
from
jove
what
his
design
was
as
regards
war
and
peace
so
as
soon
as
herzbruder
could
ride
we
despatched
our
money
for
now
we
had
but
one
purse
in
common
by
way
of
banker
draft
to
basel
equipped
ourselves
with
horses
and
servants
and
made
our
way
up
the
danube
to
ulm
and
thence
to
the
spa
before
mentioned
for
now
was
may
and
pleasant
travelling
there
did
we
hire
a
lodging
but
i
rid
to
strassburg
not
only
to
receive
in
part
our
money
which
we
had
conveyed
thither
by
way
of
basel
but
also
to
inquire
for
the
medicos
of
experience
that
should
prescribe
for
herzbruder
recipes
and
the
manner
of
his
taking
the
baths
these
came
to
me
and
were
of
opinion
that
herzbruder
had
indeed
been
poisoned
yet
was
the
poison
not
strong
enough
to
kill
him
offhand
and
therefore
it
had
made
its
way
into
his
limbs
from
whence
it
must
be
evacuated
by
drugs
antidotes
and
which
cure
would
last
some
eight
weeks
or
so
at
that
herzbruder
remembered
at
once
when
and
by
whom
that
poison
had
been
given
him
namely
by
them
that
would
have
had
his
place
in
the
army
and
when
he
further
learned
from
the
physicians
that
his
cure
needed
no
spa
then
was
he
assured
the
had
by
his
enemies
been
bribed
to
send
him
so
far
away
yet
did
he
resolve
to
complete
his
cure
there
at
the
spa
for
was
not
only
a
healthy
air
but
also
there
was
cheerful
company
among
the
this
time
would
i
not
waste
for
i
had
a
desire
to
see
my
wife
once
more
and
since
herzbruder
needed
me
not
greatly
i
did
open
to
him
my
project
which
he
did
praise
and
advised
me
i
should
visit
her
giving
me
also
certain
trinkets
of
price
which
i
should
on
his
behalf
present
to
her
and
therewith
beg
her
pardon
for
that
he
had
been
the
cause
why
i
had
not
before
sought
her
out
with
that
i
rode
to
strassburg
and
not
only
provided
myself
with
moneys
but
inquired
also
how
i
might
prosecute
my
journey
in
the
safest
way
whereupon
i
found
was
not
to
be
accomplished
by
a
horseman
riding
alone
for
the
roads
were
made
unsafe
by
the
parties
sent
out
from
so
many
garrisons
of
the
two
contending
armies
so
i
got
me
a
pass
for
a
of
strassburg
and
drew
up
certain
letters
to
my
wife
her
sisters
and
her
parents
as
i
would
send
him
with
them
to
lippstadt
yet
feigned
to
be
of
a
different
mind
took
back
the
pass
from
the
messenger
sent
back
my
horse
and
servant
and
disguised
myself
in
a
red
and
white
livery
in
that
i
journeyed
by
ship
to
cologne
which
was
at
that
time
neutral
between
the
two
parties
and
first
i
must
go
to
visit
my
jupiter
that
had
aforetime
appointed
me
his
ganymede
to
ask
how
it
fared
with
the
property
i
had
left
there
but
him
i
found
quite
again
and
full
of
anger
against
the
human
race
o
mercury
says
he
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
what
news
from
münster
do
men
conceive
they
can
make
peace
without
my
good
will
nay
never
they
did
have
peace
why
kept
they
it
not
was
not
vice
everywhere
triumphant
when
they
provoked
me
to
send
them
war
and
how
have
they
deserved
that
i
should
give
them
peace
again
have
they
since
been
converted
are
they
not
become
worse
and
do
they
not
run
into
war
as
to
a
festival
or
have
they
perchance
repented
them
by
reason
of
the
famine
that
i
sent
among
them
whereof
so
many
thousands
died
of
hunger
or
hath
the
grievous
pestilence
terrified
them
to
better
their
ways
whereby
so
many
millions
were
cut
off
nay
nay
mercurius
they
that
remain
that
did
see
these
dreadful
sufferings
with
their
own
eyes
have
not
only
not
repented
but
be
grown
worse
than
ever
they
were
and
if
they
have
not
been
turned
by
so
many
sore
plagues
nor
have
ceased
to
live
in
godless
wise
in
the
midst
of
such
trial
and
tribulation
what
will
they
do
if
i
should
grant
them
again
the
delights
of
golden
peace
then
must
i
fear
lest
as
once
did
the
giants
so
they
now
should
try
to
storm
my
heaven
but
such
overweening
i
will
check
in
good
time
and
leave
them
to
perish
in
their
war
but
i
knowing
how
one
must
go
about
with
this
god
if
one
would
make
him
hear
reason
oh
great
god
says
i
all
the
world
doth
sigh
for
peace
and
promise
great
amendment
why
wilt
thou
then
continue
to
refuse
them
such
yea
answered
jupiter
doubtless
they
sigh
yet
not
for
my
sake
but
their
own
not
that
each
may
praise
god
under
his
own
vine
and
but
that
they
may
enjoy
the
fruit
thereof
in
peace
and
delight
of
late
i
asked
of
a
scurvy
tailor
should
i
give
him
peace
he
gave
me
answer
was
the
same
to
him
that
must
ply
his
needle
as
well
in
peace
as
in
war
and
the
like
answer
i
got
from
a
brazier
which
said
if
he
could
get
no
bells
to
found
in
peace
time
yet
in
time
of
war
he
had
enough
to
do
with
cannon
and
mortars
so
likewise
a
smith
replied
to
me
and
said
i
have
no
ploughs
and
to
mend
in
yet
have
i
so
many
and
army
waggons
to
deal
with
that
i
can
well
afford
to
do
without
peace
lookye
then
dear
mercurius
why
should
i
grant
them
peace
true
there
be
some
that
do
desire
it
yet
only
as
i
say
for
their
belly
sake
and
their
pleasure
contrariwise
there
be
others
that
will
still
have
war
not
because
is
my
will
but
because
is
for
their
profit
and
just
as
the
masons
and
carpenters
desire
peace
to
earn
money
by
the
building
again
of
ruined
houses
so
others
that
be
not
sure
of
earning
a
living
by
their
handicraft
in
time
of
peace
do
hope
for
the
continuing
of
war
wherein
they
can
steal
now
when
i
found
my
jupiter
so
to
go
about
with
these
matters
i
could
well
conceive
that
he
with
so
confused
a
mind
could
give
me
little
account
of
mine
own
and
so
i
made
not
my
business
known
to
him
but
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
away
by
well
known
to
me
to
lippstadt
where
i
inquired
for
my
as
i
were
a
messenger
from
foreign
parts
and
learned
at
once
that
he
with
his
wife
had
quitted
this
world
six
months
before
and
secondly
that
my
dear
wife
having
been
delivered
of
a
that
was
now
with
her
sister
had
in
like
manner
straightway
after
her
quitted
this
mortal
scene
upon
that
i
delivered
to
my
the
writings
which
i
had
before
addressed
to
my
to
my
wife
and
to
him
my
wife
brother
who
would
have
entertained
me
himself
to
learn
from
me
as
from
a
messenger
how
it
fared
with
simplicissimus
and
of
what
rank
he
was
now
in
the
end
mine
own
did
at
length
converse
with
me
i
telling
of
myself
all
the
good
i
knew
for
my
face
had
so
marred
and
changed
me
that
no
man
could
know
me
more
save
herr
von
schönstein
and
he
as
my
true
friend
did
hold
his
tongue
but
i
telling
her
at
length
how
herr
simplicissimus
had
many
fine
horses
and
servants
and
rode
abroad
in
a
coat
all
trimmed
with
gold
yea
said
she
i
did
ever
believe
he
was
of
no
such
low
descent
as
he
gave
himself
out
to
be
the
commandant
of
this
place
did
ever
persuade
my
late
parents
with
great
assurances
that
they
had
made
a
good
match
with
him
for
my
sister
which
had
ever
been
a
virtuous
maiden
yet
of
all
that
i
myself
could
never
look
for
a
good
ending
nevertheless
did
he
content
himself
and
resolve
to
take
upon
him
either
swedish
or
hessian
service
in
the
garrison
here
and
to
that
end
would
he
fetch
hither
his
goods
that
he
had
left
at
cologne
which
turned
out
ill
and
he
himself
was
by
clean
roguery
spirited
away
into
france
leaving
my
sister
that
had
had
him
to
husband
but
for
four
weeks
yea
and
a
of
citizens
daughters
likewise
with
child
by
him
all
which
one
after
another
and
my
sister
last
of
all
were
brought
to
bed
of
boys
so
since
my
father
and
mother
were
dead
and
i
and
my
husband
without
hope
of
children
we
did
adopt
my
child
to
be
the
heir
of
all
our
property
and
with
the
help
of
the
commandant
here
did
get
possession
of
his
father
money
at
cologne
which
same
might
be
reckoned
at
three
thousand
gulden
and
so
the
young
lad
when
he
shall
come
of
age
shall
have
no
cause
to
count
himself
among
the
paupers
yea
i
and
my
husband
do
love
the
child
so
much
that
we
would
not
yield
him
up
to
his
own
father
though
he
came
in
person
to
fetch
him
away
moreover
he
is
the
comeliest
of
all
his
and
so
like
to
his
father
as
he
had
been
cut
out
on
his
very
pattern
and
i
know
if
my
did
but
hear
what
a
fair
son
he
hath
he
would
not
delay
to
come
hither
were
it
but
to
see
the
little
sweetheart
the
like
talk
my
held
by
which
i
might
well
perceive
her
love
to
my
child
which
now
ran
about
in
his
first
breeches
and
rejoiced
mine
heart
and
with
that
i
brought
out
the
trinkets
that
herzbruder
had
given
me
to
present
on
his
behalf
to
my
wife
which
said
i
master
simplicissimus
had
given
me
to
deliver
to
his
wife
for
a
salutation
who
being
dead
i
accounted
it
fair
to
leave
the
same
for
his
child
all
which
my
and
his
wife
received
with
joy
and
were
convinced
thereby
that
i
had
no
want
of
means
but
must
indeed
be
a
fellow
of
a
different
sort
from
that
which
they
had
fancied
me
to
be
so
now
i
pressed
for
leave
to
be
gone
and
having
obtained
such
i
begged
in
the
name
of
simplicissimus
to
kiss
simplicissimus
the
younger
that
i
might
tell
the
same
to
his
father
for
a
token
and
this
being
done
with
the
goodwill
of
my
my
nose
and
the
child
began
at
once
and
together
to
bleed
till
i
thought
my
heart
would
break
yet
did
i
hide
my
feelings
and
that
none
might
have
time
to
mark
the
cause
of
this
sympathy
i
took
myself
off
at
once
and
after
fourteen
days
of
much
trouble
and
danger
came
again
to
the
spa
in
beggar
garb
for
on
the
way
i
had
been
plundered
and
stripped
a
story
of
a
trick
that
simplicissimus
played
at
the
spa
so
being
returned
i
found
herzbruder
rather
worse
than
better
though
the
doctors
and
apothecaries
had
plucked
him
cleaner
than
any
pigeon
nay
more
he
seemed
to
me
now
to
be
childish
nor
could
he
walk
straight
i
did
hearten
him
up
as
best
i
could
but
his
was
an
ill
plight
himself
perceiving
well
by
his
loss
of
strength
that
he
could
not
last
long
and
his
chief
comfort
was
this
that
i
should
be
by
his
side
when
he
should
close
his
eyes
contrariwise
i
was
merry
and
sought
my
pleasure
where
i
thought
to
find
it
though
in
such
wise
that
herzbruder
lacked
none
of
my
care
yet
because
i
knew
myself
now
for
a
widower
the
fine
weather
and
my
young
blood
enticed
me
to
wantonness
whereunto
i
did
fully
give
myself
over
for
the
fear
that
had
possessed
me
at
einsiedeln
i
had
now
quite
forgot
now
there
was
at
the
spa
a
fair
lady
that
gave
herself
out
to
be
a
person
of
quality
yet
was
to
my
thinking
more
mobilis
than
nobilis
to
this
did
i
pay
my
constant
court
as
to
one
that
seemed
a
bona
roba
and
in
brief
space
of
time
did
obtain
not
only
free
entry
to
her
but
also
all
such
favours
as
i
could
desire
yet
had
i
from
the
first
a
disgust
at
her
lightness
and
so
did
devise
how
i
might
in
all
courtesy
be
rid
of
her
for
methought
she
had
her
eye
more
on
my
purse
than
on
me
for
a
bridegroom
yea
and
did
persecute
me
with
hot
and
wanton
glances
and
the
like
tokens
of
her
burning
love
wheresoever
i
might
be
till
i
must
be
shamed
both
for
her
sake
and
mine
own
at
that
time
there
was
at
the
baths
a
rich
switzer
of
quality
from
whom
was
stolen
not
only
his
money
but
his
wife
jewellery
which
was
of
gold
silver
pearls
and
precious
stones
and
since
is
as
grievous
to
lose
such
things
as
is
hard
to
get
them
therefore
the
said
switzer
would
move
heaven
and
earth
to
come
by
them
again
and
did
even
send
for
the
famous
of
the
goatskin
which
did
so
plague
the
thief
by
his
charms
that
he
must
needs
restore
the
stolen
goods
to
their
proper
place
for
which
the
wizard
earned
ten
with
this
enchanter
i
had
fain
conversed
but
as
i
then
conceived
it
could
not
be
without
lessening
of
my
dignity
for
at
that
time
i
thought
no
small
beer
of
myself
so
i
did
engage
my
servant
to
be
drunk
with
him
that
same
night
having
learned
he
was
a
toper
of
the
first
quality
to
see
if
by
such
means
i
could
have
his
acquaintance
for
so
many
strange
things
were
told
to
me
of
him
that
i
could
not
believe
till
i
had
heard
them
from
himself
to
that
end
did
i
disguise
myself
as
a
strolling
quack
and
sat
down
by
him
at
table
to
see
if
he
could
guess
or
the
devil
could
tell
him
who
i
was
yet
could
i
mark
no
such
knowledge
in
him
but
he
would
drink
and
drink
taking
me
for
that
which
my
raiment
proclaimed
me
yea
and
drank
some
few
glasses
to
my
health
yet
shewed
more
respect
to
my
knave
than
to
me
for
to
him
he
told
in
all
confidence
that
if
he
that
had
robbed
the
switzer
had
thrown
but
the
smallest
part
thereof
into
running
water
and
so
shared
the
booty
with
the
devil
it
had
been
impossible
either
to
name
the
thief
or
to
get
back
the
goods
to
all
these
silly
conceits
i
listened
and
wondered
how
the
father
of
deceits
and
lies
can
by
so
small
a
thing
bring
men
into
his
clutches
i
could
easily
conceive
that
this
was
a
clause
in
our
indenture
with
the
devil
and
perceive
how
such
a
trick
could
not
help
the
thief
if
only
another
exorcist
were
fetched
in
to
detect
the
theft
in
whose
compact
this
condition
was
not
to
be
found
and
so
charged
my
knave
that
could
steal
better
than
any
gipsy
to
make
the
man
drunk
and
then
steal
his
ten
and
presently
thereafter
to
cast
a
couple
of
batzen
into
the
river
rench
this
he
did
with
all
diligence
and
when
the
next
morning
missed
his
money
he
betook
himself
to
a
thicket
by
the
bank
of
the
rench
doubtless
to
confer
with
his
familiar
spirit
by
whom
he
was
so
that
he
came
off
with
a
face
all
bruised
and
scratched
whereat
i
felt
such
pity
for
the
poor
old
rogue
that
i
gave
him
back
his
money
and
sent
him
a
message
that
since
he
now
could
see
what
a
traitorous
evil
spirit
the
devil
was
he
might
renounce
his
service
and
company
and
turn
to
god
again
which
warning
brought
me
but
little
profit
for
presently
my
two
fair
horses
sickened
and
died
by
witchcraft
and
what
else
could
i
expect
for
i
lived
like
epicurus
in
his
stye
and
never
did
commend
my
goods
to
god
care
why
therefore
should
the
wizard
not
be
able
to
revenge
himself
on
me
how
herzbruder
died
and
how
simplicissimus
again
fell
to
wanton
courses
with
the
spa
i
was
the
more
pleased
the
longer
i
stayed
for
not
only
did
the
guests
increase
daily
but
the
place
and
the
manner
of
life
also
delighted
me
hugely
i
joined
acquaintance
with
the
merriest
that
resorted
thither
and
did
begin
to
learn
courtesy
and
compliment
wherewith
i
had
till
then
troubled
myself
but
little
and
so
was
counted
as
of
the
nobility
my
people
calling
me
ever
noble
captain
for
no
mere
soldier
of
fortune
did
ever
gain
so
high
a
post
at
that
age
at
which
i
still
was
so
with
these
rich
fops
i
made
and
they
with
me
not
acquaintance
only
but
sworn
friendship
and
pastime
play
eating
and
drinking
were
all
my
work
and
care
which
robbed
me
of
many
a
fair
ducat
without
my
much
perceiving
or
marking
of
it
for
my
purse
was
yet
fairly
heavy
with
oliver
legacy
meanwhile
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
with
herzbruder
till
at
last
he
must
pay
the
debt
of
nature
all
doctors
and
physicians
now
deserting
him
on
whom
they
had
fattened
so
long
so
he
confirmed
once
more
his
last
will
and
testament
and
made
me
heir
of
all
he
had
to
receive
from
his
late
father
property
and
in
return
i
gave
him
a
noble
funeral
and
sent
his
servants
on
their
way
with
mourning
and
money
withal
yet
his
disease
heartily
vexed
me
and
especially
because
he
had
been
poisoned
and
though
i
could
not
change
that
yet
it
changed
me
for
now
i
eschewed
all
company
and
sought
only
for
solitude
to
give
a
hearing
to
my
sad
thoughts
to
which
end
i
would
hide
myself
in
some
thicket
and
there
would
muse
not
only
upon
what
a
friend
i
had
lost
but
also
how
i
should
never
in
my
life
find
such
another
one
at
times
i
would
lay
all
manner
of
plans
for
my
future
life
and
yet
could
resolve
on
none
now
i
thought
i
would
to
the
wars
again
and
then
bethought
me
how
even
the
poorest
peasant
in
this
land
was
better
off
than
any
colonel
for
into
those
mountains
came
never
a
foraging
party
yea
i
could
well
fancy
what
an
army
would
find
to
do
there
in
ravaging
of
the
country
seeing
that
all
the
farmhouses
were
well
kept
as
if
in
and
all
the
stalls
full
of
cattle
while
in
many
a
village
of
germany
in
the
plains
neither
dog
nor
cat
could
be
found
so
as
i
delighted
myself
with
hearing
of
the
sweet
song
of
birds
and
did
fancifully
conceive
how
the
nightingale
should
by
her
dulcet
song
silence
all
other
birds
and
force
them
to
listen
either
from
shame
or
to
steal
somewhat
of
her
pleasant
strains
there
came
to
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
a
beauty
that
did
move
me
more
because
she
wore
but
the
habit
of
a
peasant
girl
than
could
any
fine
demoiselle
have
done
which
took
a
basket
from
her
head
wherein
she
had
a
pack
of
fresh
butter
to
sell
at
the
spa
this
did
she
cool
in
the
water
that
it
might
not
melt
by
reason
of
the
great
heat
and
meanwhile
sitting
down
upon
the
grass
did
throw
aside
her
kerchief
and
her
peasant
hat
and
wipe
the
sweat
from
her
face
so
that
i
could
exactly
observe
her
and
feed
my
curious
eyes
upon
her
and
truly
methought
i
had
never
seen
a
fairer
form
in
my
life
for
the
mould
of
her
figure
seemed
perfect
and
without
blemish
her
arms
and
hands
white
as
snow
her
face
fresh
and
sweet
but
her
black
eyes
full
of
fire
and
amorous
looks
so
as
she
was
packing
of
her
butter
up
again
i
cried
across
to
her
ah
maiden
is
true
ye
have
cooled
your
butter
in
the
water
with
your
fair
hands
yet
with
your
bright
eyes
have
ye
set
my
heart
afire
but
she
no
sooner
saw
and
heard
me
but
away
she
ran
as
if
she
were
pursued
without
answering
me
a
word
and
so
left
me
possessed
with
all
the
follies
wherewith
fantastic
lovers
are
wont
to
be
tormented
but
my
desire
to
be
further
illumined
by
this
sun
left
me
not
in
peace
in
the
solitude
i
had
chosen
but
caused
me
to
care
no
more
for
the
song
of
the
nightingale
than
for
the
howl
of
a
wolf
therefore
i
made
my
way
to
the
spa
and
did
send
my
page
in
front
to
accost
the
pretty
and
to
bargain
with
her
till
i
should
come
so
he
did
his
best
and
i
when
i
came
did
mine
also
but
found
a
heart
of
stone
and
such
coldness
as
i
had
never
thought
to
find
in
any
which
made
me
yet
more
in
love
especially
since
i
that
had
been
much
a
scholar
in
such
schools
might
well
judge
by
such
a
carriage
she
would
not
easily
be
befooled
and
now
should
i
have
had
either
a
great
enemy
or
a
great
friend
either
an
enemy
to
think
of
and
devise
evil
against
and
so
to
forget
my
fool
love
or
a
friend
that
should
give
me
other
counsel
and
warn
me
from
the
folly
i
proposed
but
alas
i
had
naught
but
my
money
which
did
but
dazzle
me
and
my
blind
desires
which
led
me
astray
i
giving
them
the
rein
and
mine
own
impudence
that
ruined
me
and
brought
me
to
disaster
fool
that
i
was
i
should
have
judged
by
our
clothes
as
by
an
evil
omen
that
her
love
would
work
me
woe
for
i
having
lost
herzbruder
and
the
girl
her
parents
we
were
both
dressed
in
mourning
clothes
when
we
first
met
and
so
what
joy
could
our
love
portend
in
a
word
i
was
properly
caught
in
a
fool
snare
and
therefore
as
blind
and
without
reason
as
the
boy
cupid
himself
and
because
i
had
no
hope
otherwise
to
satisfy
my
bestial
desires
i
did
determine
to
marry
her
for
how
thought
i
thou
beest
by
descent
but
a
peasant
brat
and
wilt
never
in
thy
life
keep
thy
castle
and
this
fair
champaign
is
a
noble
land
that
throughout
this
grisly
war
hath
in
comparison
with
other
parts
maintained
itself
in
peace
and
prosperity
besides
thou
hast
gold
enough
to
buy
thee
even
the
best
farm
in
this
countryside
and
now
shalt
thou
marry
with
this
honest
and
get
thee
a
lord
reputation
among
the
and
where
couldst
find
a
cheerfuller
than
near
the
spa
where
thou
canst
by
reason
of
the
coming
and
going
of
the
guests
see
a
new
world
every
six
weeks
and
so
conceive
how
the
great
world
doth
change
from
one
age
to
another
such
and
a
thousand
like
plans
i
made
till
at
length
i
sought
my
sweetheart
in
marriage
and
yet
not
without
pains
did
obtain
her
consent
how
simplicissimus
found
his
second
marriage
turn
out
and
how
he
met
with
his
dad
and
learned
who
his
parents
had
been
so
i
made
fine
preparation
for
the
wedding
for
all
seemed
to
me
not
only
did
i
buy
up
the
whole
farm
whereon
my
bride
had
been
born
but
began
also
a
fine
new
building
besides
as
if
i
would
rather
keep
court
than
keep
house
and
before
the
wedding
was
over
i
had
already
more
than
thirty
head
of
cattle
on
the
farm
for
so
many
could
it
maintain
all
the
year
round
in
a
word
i
had
the
best
of
everything
and
such
fine
household
plenishing
as
only
folly
like
mine
could
devise
but
soon
i
must
whistle
to
a
different
tune
for
i
found
my
bride
too
knowing
and
now
all
too
late
was
i
ware
of
the
cause
why
she
had
been
so
loath
to
take
me
and
what
vexed
me
most
was
that
i
could
tell
to
no
man
my
silly
plight
i
knew
well
enough
that
was
reasonable
i
must
pay
the
piper
yet
the
knowledge
made
me
not
more
patient
still
less
better
in
life
nay
rather
i
thought
to
betray
the
traitress
and
so
began
to
go
where
i
could
find
pasture
which
kept
me
rather
in
good
company
at
the
spa
than
at
home
and
for
a
year
at
least
i
left
my
housekeeping
to
take
care
of
itself
and
for
her
part
my
wife
was
as
slovenly
as
i
an
ox
that
i
had
had
slaughtered
for
household
use
she
salted
in
baskets
like
pork
and
when
she
was
to
prepare
a
for
me
she
tried
to
pluck
it
like
a
fowl
yea
she
would
cook
crayfish
with
a
and
trout
on
a
spit
from
which
examples
a
man
may
judge
what
manner
of
housewife
i
found
her
and
withal
she
would
drink
freely
of
the
good
wine
and
share
it
with
her
good
friends
and
that
was
a
sign
of
my
coming
disasters
now
it
fell
out
that
as
i
was
walking
down
the
valley
with
some
fops
of
the
spa
to
visit
a
company
at
the
lower
baths
there
met
us
an
old
peasant
with
a
goat
on
a
string
that
he
wished
to
sell
and
because
methought
i
had
seen
him
before
i
asked
whence
he
came
with
his
goat
at
which
he
doffed
his
cap
and
your
worship
says
he
that
i
may
not
tell
you
how
said
i
surely
thou
hast
not
stolen
the
beast
nay
answered
the
peasant
but
i
bring
him
from
a
village
there
in
the
valley
the
which
i
may
not
mention
to
your
worship
in
the
presence
of
a
goat
which
caused
my
company
to
laugh
and
because
i
changed
colour
they
deemed
i
was
vexed
or
ashamed
that
the
peasant
did
answer
me
so
neatly
yet
my
thoughts
were
otherwise
for
by
the
great
wart
that
this
peasant
had
like
an
unicorn
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
i
was
assured
was
my
dad
from
the
spessart
and
so
would
first
play
the
conjurer
before
i
would
make
myself
known
and
delight
him
with
so
fine
a
son
as
my
clothes
shewed
me
to
be
so
i
said
to
him
good
father
is
not
your
home
in
the
spessart
yes
your
worship
says
he
then
said
i
did
ye
not
some
eighteen
year
agone
have
your
house
and
farm
plundered
and
burnt
by
the
troopers
yea
quoth
the
peasant
yet
is
not
so
long
ago
but
i
asked
him
further
did
ye
not
then
have
two
children
a
grown
daughter
and
a
young
lad
that
kept
your
sheep
nay
your
worship
says
my
dad
the
daughter
was
my
child
but
not
the
boy
yet
would
i
bring
him
up
as
mine
own
and
by
that
i
understood
i
was
no
son
of
this
rough
yokel
and
that
in
part
rejoiced
me
yet
again
troubled
me
for
i
thought
now
i
must
be
some
bastard
or
foundling
and
therefore
asked
my
dad
how
he
had
come
by
the
said
boy
or
what
reason
he
had
had
to
rear
him
as
his
own
ah
says
he
i
had
strange
luck
with
him
by
war
i
got
him
and
by
war
i
lost
him
but
now
being
afeared
lest
some
fact
should
come
to
light
that
would
disgrace
my
birth
i
turned
the
discourse
upon
the
goat
again
and
asked
if
he
had
sold
it
to
the
hostess
for
cooking
which
would
seem
strange
to
me
as
knowing
that
her
guests
used
not
to
eat
old
goat
flesh
but
nay
your
worship
quoth
the
peasant
the
hostess
hath
goats
enow
and
will
pay
naught
for
such
i
do
bring
her
for
the
countess
that
is
at
the
spa
to
bathe
for
doctor
busybody
hath
ordered
certain
herbs
for
this
goat
to
eat
and
the
milk
that
she
gives
therefrom
the
doctor
taketh
to
make
a
medicine
for
the
countess
that
is
to
drink
the
milk
and
so
be
cured
for
they
say
the
countess
hath
no
stomach
and
if
the
goat
help
her
do
more
than
the
doctor
and
all
his
sawbones
together
while
he
thus
talked
i
considered
how
i
might
have
further
speech
with
him
and
so
offered
him
for
the
goat
a
dollar
more
than
the
doctor
or
the
countess
would
give
to
which
he
readily
agreed
for
small
gain
will
easily
turn
folk
yet
on
condition
he
should
first
tell
the
countess
that
i
had
bid
a
thaler
more
and
if
she
would
give
as
much
she
should
have
the
preference
if
not
he
would
bring
me
the
goat
and
would
in
the
evening
let
me
know
how
the
business
stood
with
that
my
dad
went
his
way
and
i
with
my
company
ours
yet
could
i
and
would
i
not
stay
longer
with
them
but
turned
me
back
and
went
where
i
found
my
dad
again
who
still
had
his
goat
for
others
would
not
give
him
so
much
as
i
which
for
so
rich
people
did
amaze
me
yet
made
me
not
more
niggardly
for
i
took
him
to
my
farm
and
paid
him
for
his
goat
and
when
i
had
him
i
asked
of
him
whence
came
the
lad
to
him
of
whom
we
spoke
ah
your
worship
says
he
the
mansfeld
war
brought
him
to
me
and
the
nördlingen
battle
took
him
away
again
and
that
quoth
i
must
be
a
merry
story
and
so
i
begged
him
since
we
had
naught
else
to
talk
of
to
tell
it
me
to
pass
the
time
with
that
he
began
and
says
he
when
mansfeld
lost
the
battle
at
höchst
his
people
were
scattered
abroad
as
not
knowing
whither
to
flee
of
whom
many
came
into
the
spessart
seeking
woods
wherein
to
hide
them
but
though
they
had
escaped
death
on
the
plains
they
found
it
in
the
hills
for
since
both
parties
thought
it
their
right
to
plunder
and
murder
one
another
on
our
lands
we
peasants
would
have
a
finger
in
their
pie
too
so
was
but
seldom
that
a
farmer
would
go
into
his
woods
without
a
musquet
for
we
could
not
bide
at
home
with
our
hoes
and
ploughs
and
in
this
wild
business
did
i
light
upon
a
fair
young
lady
mounted
on
a
goodly
horse
in
a
savage
and
lonesome
wood
yet
not
far
from
my
farm
and
just
before
i
had
heard
shots
fired
and
at
first
i
took
her
for
a
man
for
she
rode
like
such
yet
when
i
saw
her
raise
hands
and
eyes
to
heaven
and
in
a
pitiful
voice
though
in
a
strange
tongue
cry
aloud
to
god
i
lowered
my
gun
with
which
i
would
have
fired
upon
her
and
uncocked
it
for
her
cries
and
actions
did
well
assure
me
was
a
woman
and
one
in
trouble
withal
so
we
drew
near
to
each
other
and
when
she
saw
me
says
she
ye
be
a
christian
and
an
honest
man
i
pray
you
for
god
and
his
mercy
yea
and
for
that
last
judgment
before
which
we
must
all
give
account
of
our
deeds
and
misdeeds
to
bring
me
to
some
married
woman
that
with
help
may
deliver
me
of
my
burden
which
words
as
being
of
such
import
together
with
the
gentle
speech
and
the
troubled
yet
fair
and
kind
face
of
the
poor
lady
did
compel
me
to
such
pity
that
i
took
her
horse
by
the
bridle
and
led
her
over
bush
and
brier
to
the
thickest
part
of
the
wood
whither
i
had
brought
my
wife
my
child
my
people
and
my
cattle
for
refuge
and
there
within
half
an
hour
was
she
delivered
of
that
young
boy
of
whom
we
did
discourse
with
that
my
dad
finished
his
story
and
his
glass
for
i
was
no
niggard
of
my
wine
for
him
and
when
he
had
emptied
it
i
asked
him
how
it
fared
thereafter
with
the
lady
to
which
he
answered
thus
when
she
was
delivered
she
begged
me
to
be
godfather
and
to
bring
the
child
to
baptism
as
soon
as
might
be
and
told
me
her
own
and
her
husband
name
that
they
might
be
written
in
the
book
of
christenings
and
then
did
she
open
her
wallet
wherein
she
had
full
costly
trinkets
and
of
these
gave
so
many
to
me
to
my
wife
and
child
my
and
to
another
woman
that
was
by
that
we
might
well
be
content
with
her
but
even
while
she
did
this
and
told
us
of
her
husband
she
died
under
our
hands
having
first
commended
the
child
to
us
but
since
the
tumult
in
the
land
was
then
so
great
that
none
could
abide
in
his
own
house
we
had
much
trouble
to
come
by
a
clergyman
that
should
baptize
the
child
and
attend
the
funeral
yet
both
being
done
was
commanded
me
by
our
burgomaster
and
our
priest
that
i
should
rear
the
child
till
was
grown
and
for
my
trouble
and
cost
should
keep
all
the
lady
property
save
a
few
rosaries
and
precious
stones
and
jewellery
which
i
should
keep
for
the
child
so
my
wife
did
nourish
the
babe
with
goat
milk
and
we
loved
the
lad
and
did
think
when
he
should
be
grown
up
to
give
him
our
daughter
to
wife
but
after
the
battle
at
nördlingen
did
i
lose
both
boy
and
girl
and
all
that
i
possessed
now
says
i
to
my
dad
ye
have
told
me
a
pretty
tale
enough
and
yet
forgot
the
best
part
for
ye
have
not
told
me
the
name
of
the
lady
or
her
husband
or
the
child
your
honour
he
answered
i
thought
not
ye
desired
to
know
it
but
the
lady
name
was
susanna
ramsay
her
husband
was
captain
sternfels
of
fuchsheim
and
because
my
name
was
melchior
did
i
have
the
child
baptized
melchior
sternfels
of
fuchsheim
and
so
inscribed
in
the
book
now
from
that
i
knew
clearly
that
i
was
the
son
of
my
hermit
and
of
governor
ramsay
sister
but
alas
far
too
late
for
my
parents
were
both
dead
and
of
my
uncle
ramsay
could
i
learn
nothing
save
that
the
hanauers
had
rid
themselves
of
him
and
his
swedish
garrison
whereat
he
had
gone
crazy
for
rage
and
vexation
but
i
treated
my
godfather
well
with
wine
and
next
day
had
his
wife
fetcht
likewise
yet
when
i
declared
myself
to
them
would
they
not
believe
it
till
i
did
shew
them
a
black
and
hairy
mole
i
had
upon
my
breast
in
what
manner
the
pains
of
came
upon
him
and
how
he
became
a
widower
not
long
after
this
i
did
take
my
godfather
with
me
and
ride
into
the
spessart
to
get
certain
news
and
certificate
of
my
descent
and
noble
birth
which
i
gat
without
difficulty
from
the
book
of
baptisms
and
my
godfather
witness
and
presently
thereafter
visited
the
priest
that
had
dwelt
at
hanau
and
had
taken
care
of
me
which
gave
me
a
writing
to
declare
where
my
late
father
had
died
and
that
i
had
abode
with
him
to
his
death
and
thereafter
for
a
long
time
with
master
ramsay
the
commandant
at
hanau
under
the
name
of
simplicissimus
yea
i
had
an
instrument
containing
my
whole
history
drawn
up
by
a
notary
out
of
the
mouth
of
witnesses
for
i
thought
who
knoweth
when
thou
wilt
have
need
of
it
and
this
journey
did
cost
me
thalers
for
on
my
return
i
was
captured
by
a
party
dismounted
and
plundered
so
that
i
and
my
dad
or
godfather
came
off
naked
and
hardly
with
our
lives
meanwhile
things
went
ill
at
home
for
as
soon
as
my
wife
knew
her
husband
was
a
nobleman
she
not
only
did
play
the
great
lady
but
did
neglect
all
housekeeping
which
i
bore
in
silence
because
she
was
big
with
child
moreover
misfortune
came
on
my
cattle
and
robbed
me
of
my
chiefest
and
best
all
which
have
been
possible
to
endure
but
o
gemini
misfortunes
came
not
singly
for
even
then
while
my
wife
was
delivered
the
maid
was
brought
to
bed
likewise
and
the
child
she
bore
was
indeed
like
to
me
but
that
which
my
wife
had
was
so
like
to
the
as
it
had
been
cut
on
the
pattern
of
his
face
nay
more
for
the
lady
of
whom
i
writ
above
did
in
the
same
night
cause
one
to
be
laid
at
my
door
with
notice
in
writing
that
i
was
the
father
and
so
did
i
get
a
family
of
three
at
once
and
could
not
but
expect
that
others
would
creep
out
of
every
corner
which
caused
me
not
a
few
grey
hairs
but
so
will
it
fare
with
whoever
doth
follow
his
own
bestial
lusts
in
such
a
godless
and
wicked
way
of
life
as
i
had
led
and
now
what
to
do
i
must
have
the
baptism
and
be
soundly
punished
by
the
magistrate
and
the
government
being
then
swedish
and
i
an
old
soldier
of
the
emperor
the
score
was
the
heavier
to
pay
all
which
was
but
the
preface
to
my
complete
ruination
the
second
time
and
although
all
these
manifold
disasters
did
greatly
trouble
me
yet
my
wife
contrariwise
took
all
lightly
yea
did
mock
at
me
day
and
night
about
the
fine
treasure
that
had
been
laid
at
my
door
and
for
which
i
had
paid
so
dearly
yet
had
she
but
known
how
was
with
me
and
the
maid
she
would
have
plagued
me
yet
worse
but
that
good
creature
was
so
complacent
as
to
let
herself
be
persuaded
with
as
much
money
as
i
should
other
ways
have
been
fined
for
her
sake
to
swear
her
child
to
a
fop
that
had
at
times
visited
me
the
year
before
and
had
been
at
the
wedding
but
whom
otherwise
she
knew
not
yet
must
she
go
for
my
wife
did
suspect
what
i
thought
of
her
and
the
yet
dared
not
hint
thereat
for
else
had
i
proved
to
her
that
i
could
not
at
once
be
with
her
and
with
the
maid
yet
all
the
while
i
was
tormented
with
the
thought
that
i
must
rear
a
child
for
my
servant
and
mine
own
sons
should
not
be
my
heirs
and
yet
must
i
hold
my
peace
and
be
glad
that
none
else
knew
of
it
and
with
such
thoughts
did
i
daily
torment
myself
while
my
wife
revelled
every
hour
in
wine
for
since
our
marriage
she
had
so
used
herself
to
the
bottle
that
was
seldom
away
from
her
mouth
and
she
herself
scarce
went
to
bed
any
night
but
by
which
means
she
robbed
her
child
of
its
nourishment
and
so
inflamed
her
inward
parts
that
soon
after
they
fell
out
and
so
made
me
a
widower
the
second
time
which
went
so
my
heart
that
i
wellnigh
laughed
myself
into
a
sickness
relation
of
certain
peasants
concerning
the
wonderful
mummelsee
so
now
did
i
find
myself
restored
to
mine
ancient
freedom
but
with
a
purse
pretty
well
emptied
of
gold
and
yet
a
great
household
overburdened
with
cattle
and
servants
therefore
i
took
my
melchior
to
be
as
my
father
and
my
his
wife
to
be
my
mother
and
young
bastard
simplicissimus
that
had
been
laid
at
my
door
i
made
my
heir
and
handed
over
to
these
two
old
people
house
and
farm
together
with
all
my
property
save
a
few
and
jewels
that
i
had
saved
and
kept
hidden
to
meet
extreme
need
for
now
had
i
conceived
such
a
loathing
for
the
company
and
society
of
all
women
that
i
had
determined
having
fared
so
ill
with
them
never
to
marry
again
so
this
old
couple
which
in
matters
rustic
could
hardly
meet
their
likes
for
skill
presently
arranged
my
housekeeping
in
different
fashion
for
they
got
rid
of
such
cattle
and
servants
as
were
of
no
use
and
in
their
place
had
for
the
farm
such
as
would
bring
profit
so
my
old
dad
and
my
mammy
bade
me
be
of
good
cheer
and
promised
if
i
would
let
them
manage
all
to
keep
me
ever
a
good
horse
in
the
stable
and
myself
so
well
furnished
that
i
could
now
and
then
drink
my
measure
of
wine
with
any
honest
companion
and
presently
i
was
ware
of
what
manner
of
people
now
managed
my
estate
for
my
with
the
labourers
tilled
the
ground
and
bargained
for
cattle
and
wood
and
resin
sharper
than
any
jew
while
his
wife
gave
herself
to
and
contrived
to
save
the
and
keep
it
better
than
ten
such
wives
as
i
had
had
in
such
wise
my
farmyard
was
in
short
space
furnished
with
all
needful
implements
and
cattle
small
and
great
so
that
soon
was
esteemed
one
of
the
best
in
that
and
i
meanwhile
took
my
walks
abroad
and
gave
myself
up
to
contemplations
for
when
i
saw
how
my
earned
more
by
her
bees
alone
in
wax
and
honey
than
my
wife
had
gained
from
cattle
swine
and
all
the
rest
together
i
could
well
conceive
that
in
other
matters
she
would
not
be
caught
napping
now
it
happened
on
a
time
that
i
took
my
walk
in
the
spa
more
for
the
sake
of
a
draught
of
fresh
water
than
according
to
my
former
usage
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
fops
for
i
had
begun
to
imitate
the
thriftiness
of
my
parents
who
counselled
me
i
should
not
much
consort
with
folk
that
so
wantonly
wasted
their
own
and
their
father
goods
yet
i
joined
myself
to
a
company
of
men
of
moderate
rank
who
even
then
were
in
discourse
concerning
a
strange
matter
namely
of
the
mummelsee
which
said
they
was
bottomless
and
which
was
situate
on
one
of
the
highest
mountains
near
by
and
they
had
sent
for
several
old
peasants
and
would
have
them
to
tell
all
that
one
and
the
other
had
heard
of
this
wondrous
lake
to
whose
stories
i
hearkened
with
great
delight
though
i
held
them
all
to
be
as
vain
fables
as
be
some
of
plinius
tales
for
one
said
if
any
man
should
tie
up
an
odd
number
of
things
such
as
peas
or
pebbles
or
what
not
in
a
kerchief
and
let
it
down
into
the
water
presently
the
number
would
be
even
and
if
one
should
drop
in
an
even
number
at
once
it
became
odd
others
and
indeed
the
most
part
declared
and
confirmed
what
they
said
by
examples
that
if
a
man
should
throw
in
one
or
more
stones
however
fair
the
skies
might
be
till
then
at
once
there
would
arise
a
terrible
storm
with
fearful
rain
hail
and
hurricane
from
that
they
came
to
all
manner
of
strange
histories
that
had
happened
there
and
what
wondrous
appearances
of
and
had
there
been
seen
and
how
they
had
talked
with
mankind
one
told
how
on
a
time
as
certain
herdsmen
were
keeping
cattle
by
the
lake
there
arose
a
brown
ox
out
of
the
water
that
mixed
with
the
other
cattle
but
there
followed
him
a
little
mannikin
to
drive
him
back
into
the
lake
who
would
not
obey
till
the
little
man
had
sworn
that
if
he
did
not
come
back
he
should
suffer
all
the
ills
of
human
kind
at
which
words
ox
and
man
again
sank
into
the
lake
another
said
it
happened
at
a
time
when
the
lake
was
frozen
over
that
a
peasant
with
his
oxen
and
sundry
trunks
of
trees
such
as
we
hew
planks
out
of
passed
over
the
lake
without
harm
but
when
his
dog
would
follow
him
the
ice
broke
and
so
the
poor
beast
fell
in
and
was
never
seen
again
and
yet
another
swore
was
solemn
truth
that
a
huntsman
following
in
the
track
of
game
was
passing
by
the
lake
and
there
saw
a
sitting
with
a
whole
lapful
of
coined
money
and
playing
therewith
at
whom
when
he
would
have
shot
the
spirit
sank
into
the
water
and
cried
hadst
thou
but
prayed
me
to
help
thee
in
thy
trade
i
would
have
made
thee
and
thine
rich
for
life
such
and
the
like
tales
which
seemed
to
me
all
as
fables
with
which
we
do
amuse
our
children
did
i
hearken
to
and
never
deemed
it
possible
that
there
could
be
such
a
bottomless
lake
upon
a
high
mountain
but
there
were
other
peasants
and
those
old
and
credible
men
that
affirmed
that
within
their
own
and
their
father
memory
high
and
princely
persons
had
journeyed
to
behold
the
said
lake
and
that
a
reigning
duke
of
würtemberg
had
caused
a
raft
to
be
made
and
had
put
out
into
the
lake
thereupon
to
sound
its
depth
but
that
after
the
measures
had
already
let
down
nine
which
is
a
measure
of
length
better
understanded
of
the
peasants
wives
of
the
black
forest
than
of
me
or
any
other
geometer
with
a
and
yet
had
found
no
bottom
the
raft
contrary
to
the
nature
of
wood
began
to
sink
so
that
they
that
were
upon
it
must
perforce
give
up
their
purpose
and
make
all
haste
to
land
and
so
to
this
day
can
be
seen
the
fragments
of
the
raft
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
with
the
arms
of
würtemberg
and
other
matters
carved
upon
the
wood
for
a
memorial
of
this
history
others
called
many
witnesses
to
prove
that
a
certain
archduke
of
austria
had
desired
to
drain
the
lake
but
was
by
many
dissuaded
and
at
the
petition
of
the
people
of
the
land
the
plan
given
up
for
fear
lest
the
whole
country
might
be
drowned
and
destroyed
furthermore
the
said
noble
princes
had
caused
barrels
full
of
trout
to
be
put
into
the
lake
all
which
in
less
than
an
hour
died
before
their
eyes
and
floated
away
through
the
outlet
of
the
lake
notwithstanding
that
the
stream
that
flows
under
the
mountain
on
which
the
lake
lies
and
through
the
valley
that
takes
its
name
therefrom
produces
by
nature
such
fish
and
that
the
outlet
of
the
lake
is
into
the
said
stream
of
the
marvellous
thanksgiving
of
a
patient
and
of
the
holy
thoughts
thereby
awakened
in
simplicissimus
these
last
did
so
affirm
what
they
said
that
i
now
began
almost
entirely
to
believe
them
and
they
did
so
move
my
curiosity
that
i
determined
to
visit
this
wondrous
lake
but
of
those
that
with
me
had
listened
to
the
whole
story
one
judged
one
way
and
another
another
from
which
sufficiently
appeared
their
different
and
contradictory
ways
of
thinking
for
my
part
i
said
the
german
name
mummelsee
sufficiently
declared
that
there
was
about
the
thing
as
about
a
masquerade
some
disguise
so
that
none
might
fathom
either
its
nature
or
its
depth
which
had
never
yet
been
discovered
though
such
high
personages
had
attempted
it
and
with
that
i
betook
me
to
the
same
place
where
a
year
before
i
had
seen
my
departed
wife
for
the
first
time
and
drank
in
the
sweet
poison
of
love
and
there
i
laid
myself
down
on
the
green
grass
in
the
shade
yet
took
no
heed
as
i
had
done
before
to
what
the
nightingales
did
sing
but
rather
pondered
on
the
changes
i
had
suffered
since
then
i
represented
to
myself
how
in
that
very
place
i
had
begun
to
be
in
place
of
a
free
man
a
slave
of
love
and
how
since
then
i
had
become
from
an
officer
a
peasant
from
a
rich
peasant
a
poor
nobleman
from
a
simplicissimus
a
melchior
from
a
widower
a
husband
from
a
husband
a
cuckold
and
from
a
cuckold
a
widower
again
moreover
from
a
peasant
brat
i
had
proved
to
be
the
son
of
a
good
soldier
and
yet
again
the
son
of
my
old
dad
then
again
i
reflected
how
fate
had
robbed
me
of
my
herzbruder
and
in
his
place
had
provided
me
with
two
old
married
folk
i
thought
of
the
godly
life
and
decease
of
my
father
the
piteous
death
of
my
mother
and
further
of
the
manifold
changes
which
i
had
undergone
in
my
lifetime
till
i
could
no
longer
refrain
myself
from
tears
and
even
while
i
reflected
how
much
good
money
i
in
my
lifetime
had
possessed
and
squandered
away
and
began
to
lament
therefore
there
came
two
good
soakers
or
winebibbers
on
whom
the
gout
had
fastened
in
their
limbs
whereby
they
were
crippled
and
needed
both
the
baths
and
to
drink
the
waters
these
set
themselves
down
by
me
for
was
a
fair
place
to
rest
and
each
bewailed
to
the
other
his
sad
case
as
thinking
that
they
were
alone
so
said
the
one
my
doctor
hath
sent
me
here
either
as
one
of
whose
healing
he
despaired
or
else
as
one
that
with
others
might
help
him
to
repay
my
host
here
for
the
keg
of
butter
he
sent
him
i
would
i
had
either
never
seen
him
in
my
life
or
else
that
he
had
at
the
first
sent
me
to
the
spa
for
so
should
i
either
have
more
money
than
now
or
else
be
sounder
for
the
waters
suit
my
case
right
well
and
ah
says
the
other
i
thank
my
god
that
he
hath
given
me
no
more
money
to
spare
than
what
i
have
for
had
my
doctor
known
that
i
had
more
behind
he
had
never
counselled
me
to
come
to
the
spa
but
i
must
have
shared
all
between
him
and
his
apothecaries
that
for
this
cause
do
oil
his
palms
year
by
year
yea
even
though
i
should
have
died
and
perished
in
the
meanwhile
these
greedy
fellows
send
not
men
like
us
to
so
healthful
a
place
till
they
be
well
assured
they
can
help
us
no
more
or
else
find
us
pigeons
they
can
pluck
no
longer
and
if
the
truth
must
be
confessed
he
that
once
deals
with
them
and
of
whom
they
know
that
he
has
money
must
pay
them
only
to
this
end
that
they
keep
him
sick
and
much
more
evil
had
these
two
to
say
of
their
doctors
but
i
care
not
to
tell
it
all
otherwise
might
the
gentlemen
of
that
profession
take
it
amiss
and
some
time
or
other
give
me
a
dose
that
should
purge
my
soul
out
of
my
body
nay
i
do
but
mention
it
for
this
cause
because
this
second
patient
in
giving
thanks
to
god
that
he
had
given
him
no
more
wealth
so
comforted
me
that
i
banished
clean
out
of
my
mind
all
vexations
and
heavy
thoughts
that
had
assailed
me
on
the
score
of
money
and
i
did
resolve
to
strive
no
more
for
honour
nor
gold
nor
for
aught
else
that
the
world
loveth
yea
i
determined
to
be
a
philosopher
and
to
devote
myself
to
a
godly
life
and
in
especial
to
lament
mine
own
impenitence
and
to
endeavour
myself
like
my
dear
departed
father
to
ascend
to
the
highest
degree
of
piety
how
simplicissimus
journeyed
with
the
sylphs
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
now
this
desire
to
visit
the
mummelsee
increased
with
me
when
i
learned
from
my
that
he
had
been
there
and
knew
the
way
thither
but
when
he
heard
that
i
likewise
would
go
and
what
will
ye
gain
says
he
by
going
thither
my
son
with
his
old
dad
will
see
naught
else
but
the
picture
of
a
pond
lying
in
the
midst
of
a
great
wood
and
when
he
hath
paid
for
his
present
taste
with
sore
distaste
he
will
have
naught
but
repentance
and
weary
feet
for
a
man
can
hardly
come
to
the
place
by
riding
and
the
way
back
instead
of
the
way
thither
nor
should
ever
any
man
have
had
me
to
go
thither
had
i
not
been
forced
to
flee
there
when
doctor
daniel
by
which
he
meant
duc
marched
with
his
troops
down
through
the
country
to
philippsburg
yet
my
curiosity
would
not
be
turned
aside
by
his
dissuasion
but
i
got
me
a
fellow
that
should
guide
me
thither
so
my
father
seeing
my
fixed
intent
said
since
the
was
gathered
in
and
there
was
neither
hoeing
nor
reaping
to
be
done
on
the
farm
he
would
even
go
with
me
and
shew
the
way
for
he
loved
me
so
that
he
would
fain
not
let
me
out
of
his
sight
and
since
all
the
people
of
the
country
believed
i
was
his
son
he
was
proud
of
me
and
so
behaved
to
me
and
to
all
others
as
a
poor
man
might
well
do
in
respect
of
a
son
whom
good
fortune
without
his
own
help
and
assistance
had
turned
into
a
fine
gentleman
so
together
we
set
off
over
hill
and
dale
and
came
to
the
mummelsee
and
that
before
we
had
gone
six
hours
for
my
dad
was
as
lively
as
a
cricket
and
as
good
a
traveller
as
any
young
man
and
there
we
consumed
what
meat
and
drink
we
had
brought
with
us
for
the
long
journey
and
the
high
mountain
on
which
the
lake
lieth
had
made
us
both
hungry
and
thirsty
so
having
refreshed
ourselves
i
did
inspect
the
lake
and
found
lying
in
it
certain
hewn
timbers
which
my
dad
and
i
took
to
be
the
remains
of
the
würtemberg
raft
and
i
by
geometry
took
or
estimated
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
water
for
was
far
too
wearisome
to
go
round
the
lake
and
measure
it
by
paces
or
feet
and
entered
the
dimensions
by
means
of
the
scale
of
reduction
in
my
tablets
and
having
done
this
the
sky
being
completely
clear
and
the
air
windless
and
calm
i
must
needs
try
what
truth
was
in
the
legend
that
a
storm
would
arise
if
any
should
throw
a
stone
into
the
lake
having
already
found
those
stories
i
had
heard
how
the
lake
would
suffer
no
trout
to
live
in
it
to
be
true
by
reason
of
the
mineral
taste
of
the
waters
so
to
make
trial
of
this
i
walked
along
the
lake
to
the
left
where
the
water
which
elsewhere
is
as
clear
as
a
crystal
doth
begin
by
reason
of
the
monstrous
depth
to
shew
as
black
as
coal
and
therefore
is
so
dreadful
of
appearance
that
the
mere
look
of
it
doth
terrify
and
there
i
began
to
cast
in
stones
as
great
as
i
could
carry
my
or
dad
not
only
refusing
to
help
me
but
warning
and
begging
me
to
give
over
as
much
as
in
him
lay
but
i
went
busily
on
with
my
work
and
such
stones
as
by
reason
of
their
size
and
weight
i
could
not
carry
i
rolled
down
till
i
had
cast
more
than
thirty
such
into
the
lake
then
began
the
sky
to
be
covered
with
black
clouds
in
which
terrible
thundering
was
heard
so
that
my
dad
which
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
by
the
outlet
lamenting
over
my
work
cried
out
to
me
that
i
should
escape
lest
we
be
caught
by
the
rain
and
the
dreadful
storm
or
even
a
worse
mishap
chance
to
us
but
in
despite
of
all
i
answered
him
father
i
will
stay
and
await
the
end
even
though
it
rained
pitchforks
yea
yea
answered
he
ye
act
like
all
madcap
boys
that
care
not
if
the
world
perish
but
i
while
i
listened
to
his
scolding
turned
not
mine
eyes
away
from
the
depths
of
the
lake
expecting
to
see
certain
bladders
or
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
as
is
wont
to
happen
when
stones
are
thrown
into
deep
water
whether
still
or
running
yet
saw
i
naught
of
the
kind
but
was
ware
of
certain
creatures
floating
far
down
in
the
depths
which
in
form
reminded
me
of
frogs
and
flitted
about
like
sparks
from
a
mounting
rocket
which
in
the
air
doth
work
its
full
effect
and
as
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
me
they
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
more
like
to
the
human
form
at
which
at
first
great
wonder
took
hold
of
me
and
at
last
when
i
saw
them
hard
by
me
a
great
fear
and
trembling
ah
said
i
then
to
myself
in
my
terror
and
wonder
and
yet
so
loud
that
my
dad
that
stood
beyond
the
lake
could
hear
me
though
the
noise
of
the
thunder
was
dreadful
how
great
are
the
wondrous
works
of
the
creator
yea
even
in
the
womb
of
the
earth
and
the
depths
of
the
waters
and
scarce
had
i
said
these
words
when
one
of
these
sylphs
appeared
upon
the
waters
and
answered
me
aha
and
thou
dost
acknowledge
that
before
thou
hast
seen
aught
thereof
what
wouldst
say
if
thou
wert
for
once
in
the
centrum
terrae
and
beheldest
our
dwelling
which
thy
curiosity
hath
disturbed
meanwhile
there
rose
up
here
and
there
more
of
such
like
diving
birds
all
looking
upon
me
and
bringing
up
again
the
stones
i
had
cast
in
which
amazed
me
much
and
the
first
and
chiefest
among
them
whose
raiment
shone
like
pure
gold
and
silver
cast
to
me
a
shining
stone
of
the
bigness
of
a
pigeon
egg
and
green
and
transparent
as
an
emerald
with
these
words
take
thou
this
trinket
that
thou
mayst
have
somewhat
to
report
of
us
and
of
our
lake
but
scarce
had
i
picked
it
up
and
pocketed
it
when
it
seemed
to
me
the
air
would
choke
or
drown
me
so
that
i
could
not
stand
upright
but
rolled
about
like
a
ball
of
yarn
and
at
last
fell
into
the
lake
yet
no
sooner
was
i
in
the
water
than
i
recovered
and
through
the
virtue
of
the
stone
i
had
upon
me
could
breathe
in
water
instead
of
air
yea
i
could
with
small
effort
float
in
the
lake
as
well
as
could
the
yea
and
with
them
descended
into
the
depths
which
reminded
me
of
nothing
so
much
as
of
a
flock
of
birds
that
so
descend
in
circles
from
the
upper
air
to
light
upon
the
ground
but
my
dad
having
beheld
this
marvel
in
part
namely
so
much
of
it
as
was
done
above
the
water
made
off
from
the
lake
and
home
again
as
if
his
head
were
on
fire
and
there
he
told
the
whole
history
but
especially
how
the
had
brought
back
those
stones
that
i
had
cast
into
the
lake
in
the
midst
of
the
thunderstorm
and
had
laid
them
where
they
came
from
but
in
exchange
had
taken
me
down
with
them
so
some
believed
him
but
most
accounted
it
a
fable
others
conceived
that
i
had
like
another
empedocles
of
agrigentum
which
cast
himself
into
mount
aetna
that
all
might
think
since
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
that
he
was
taken
up
to
heaven
drowned
myself
in
the
lake
and
charged
my
father
to
spread
such
tales
about
me
to
gain
for
me
an
immortal
name
for
said
they
it
had
long
been
marked
by
my
melancholic
humour
that
i
was
others
would
fain
have
believed
had
they
not
known
my
strength
of
body
that
my
adopted
father
had
himself
murdered
me
to
be
rid
of
me
being
a
miserly
old
man
and
so
be
master
alone
on
my
farm
so
that
at
this
time
naught
else
but
the
mummelsee
and
me
and
my
departure
and
my
could
be
talked
of
or
discoursed
on
either
at
the
spa
or
in
the
countryside
contain
merely
a
farrago
of
nonsense
conveyed
in
conversations
with
the
prince
of
the
mummelsee
who
explains
to
simplicissimus
the
construction
of
the
earth
crust
and
the
nature
of
sylphs
and
in
turn
is
treated
by
him
to
an
account
of
earthly
affairs
on
which
he
makes
the
usual
commonplace
satirical
remarks
see
the
introduction
how
simplicissimus
returned
from
the
middle
of
the
earth
and
of
his
strange
fancies
his
aircastles
his
calculations
and
how
he
reckoned
without
his
host
meanwhile
the
time
drew
near
that
i
should
return
home
therefore
the
king
bade
me
declare
my
wishes
whereby
i
understood
he
was
minded
to
do
me
a
favour
so
i
said
no
greater
kindness
could
be
shewn
me
than
to
cause
a
real
medicinal
spring
to
rise
on
my
farm
and
is
that
all
answered
the
king
i
had
thought
thou
wouldst
have
taken
with
thee
some
of
these
great
emeralds
from
the
american
sea
and
have
asked
to
bear
them
with
thee
back
to
earth
now
do
i
see
that
there
is
no
greed
among
you
christians
therewith
he
handed
to
me
a
stone
of
strange
and
glittering
colours
and
said
put
this
in
thy
pouch
and
wheresoever
thou
layest
in
on
the
ground
there
will
it
begin
to
seek
the
centre
of
the
earth
again
and
to
pass
through
the
most
fitting
mineralia
till
it
come
back
to
us
and
for
our
part
we
will
send
thee
a
noble
mineral
spring
that
shall
work
thee
such
good
and
profit
as
thou
hast
deserved
of
us
by
thy
declaration
of
the
truth
so
thereupon
the
prince
of
the
mummelsee
took
me
again
under
his
charge
and
passed
with
me
through
the
road
and
the
lake
by
which
we
had
come
and
this
way
back
seemed
to
me
far
longer
than
the
way
thither
so
that
i
reckoned
it
at
three
thousand
five
hundred
miles
well
measured
but
doubtless
the
cause
that
the
time
seemed
so
long
to
me
was
that
i
had
no
speech
of
my
escort
save
that
i
learned
from
them
they
were
from
three
to
five
hundred
years
old
and
lived
all
this
time
without
the
least
disease
for
the
rest
i
was
in
fancy
so
rich
with
my
spring
that
all
my
wits
and
all
my
thoughts
were
busied
with
this
to
wit
where
i
should
plant
it
and
how
turn
it
to
profit
and
first
i
had
my
plans
for
the
fine
buildings
that
i
must
set
up
that
the
might
be
properly
accommodated
and
i
for
my
part
might
gain
great
hire
for
lodgings
then
i
devised
already
by
what
bribes
i
could
persuade
the
doctors
to
prefer
my
new
miraculous
spa
to
all
the
others
yea
even
to
that
of
schwalbach
and
so
procure
for
me
a
crowd
of
rich
patients
in
my
fantasy
i
even
levelled
whole
mountains
lest
they
that
came
and
went
should
find
the
way
wearisome
to
travel
already
i
hired
drawers
sparing
cooks
careful
chambermaids
watchful
grooms
spruce
intendants
of
the
baths
and
springs
and
already
i
thought
of
a
place
where
in
the
midst
of
the
wild
mountains
by
my
farm
i
might
plant
a
fine
level
and
there
rear
all
manner
of
rare
plants
that
the
and
their
wives
that
came
from
foreign
parts
might
walk
therein
where
the
sick
might
be
cheered
and
the
sound
might
be
amused
and
exercised
with
all
manner
of
sports
and
pastimes
then
must
the
doctors
for
a
reward
write
me
a
noble
treatise
on
my
spring
and
set
down
on
paper
its
healing
qualities
and
this
i
would
have
printed
with
a
fine
plate
wherein
my
farm
should
be
depicted
and
a
ground
plan
thereof
given
by
reading
which
any
absent
patient
might
at
once
believe
and
hope
himself
in
health
again
then
would
i
have
all
my
children
fetched
from
lippstadt
to
have
them
taught
all
that
was
needful
to
know
of
my
new
for
was
my
intent
to
scarify
my
guests
purses
well
though
not
their
backs
with
such
rich
fancies
and
overweening
castles
in
the
air
i
came
again
into
the
upper
world
for
this
prince
brought
me
again
to
land
from
his
mummelsee
with
dry
clothes
and
there
i
must
forthwith
cast
from
me
the
talisman
that
he
had
at
first
given
me
when
he
fetched
me
away
else
had
i
either
been
choked
in
the
air
or
must
have
plunged
my
head
under
the
water
again
such
was
the
effect
of
the
said
stone
which
being
done
and
he
having
taken
it
to
him
again
we
commended
each
other
to
the
protection
of
the
most
high
as
men
that
should
never
meet
again
so
he
with
his
people
dived
under
and
sank
into
his
depths
but
i
with
my
stone
which
the
king
had
given
me
went
thence
as
full
of
joy
as
if
i
had
fetched
the
golden
fleece
home
from
colchis
but
alas
my
joy
of
which
i
vainly
hoped
for
the
everlasting
continuance
endured
not
long
for
hardly
was
i
gone
from
that
lake
of
wonders
when
i
began
to
go
astray
in
that
rhonstrous
wood
for
i
had
not
marked
from
what
direction
my
dad
had
brought
me
to
the
lake
yet
i
went
some
way
on
before
i
was
aware
of
my
mistake
ever
making
calculations
how
i
could
plant
that
noble
spring
on
my
farm
and
build
round
it
and
earn
for
myself
a
peaceful
revenue
as
proprietor
thereof
in
this
way
i
unawares
strayed
further
and
further
from
the
place
whither
i
desired
to
come
and
worst
of
all
i
found
it
not
out
till
the
sun
was
sinking
and
i
was
helpless
for
there
i
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
wilderness
like
simple
simon
without
food
or
arms
of
which
i
might
well
have
need
during
the
night
that
was
coming
on
yet
i
found
comfort
in
my
stone
that
i
had
brought
with
me
from
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
patience
patience
said
i
to
myself
this
will
again
repay
thee
for
all
sufferings
undergone
all
good
things
take
time
and
fine
rewards
be
not
won
without
great
toil
and
labour
else
would
every
fool
need
but
to
wipe
his
beard
to
get
possession
at
will
of
even
such
a
noble
spring
as
thou
hast
in
thy
poke
and
having
spoken
thus
i
got
with
my
new
resolve
new
strength
so
that
i
went
forward
with
a
bolder
gait
than
heretofore
although
night
now
overtook
me
the
full
moon
indeed
shone
on
me
brightly
but
the
tall
kept
the
light
from
me
more
than
the
deep
sea
had
done
that
very
day
yet
i
made
my
way
on
till
about
midnight
i
was
ware
of
a
fire
afar
off
to
which
i
straightway
walked
and
saw
from
a
distance
that
there
were
certain
woodmen
about
it
and
though
such
folk
be
not
at
all
times
to
be
trusted
yet
my
necessity
compelled
me
and
my
own
courage
urged
me
on
to
speak
to
them
so
i
came
quietly
behind
them
and
said
good
night
or
good
day
or
good
morrow
or
good
even
gentlemen
for
tell
me
what
hour
it
is
that
i
may
know
how
to
greet
ye
with
that
the
whole
six
stood
or
sat
there
all
with
fear
and
knew
not
what
to
answer
me
for
i
being
of
great
stature
and
just
at
that
time
by
reason
of
mourning
for
my
late
wife
being
in
black
raiment
and
in
especial
having
a
terrible
cudgel
in
mine
hand
on
which
i
leaned
like
a
wild
man
of
the
woods
my
figure
seemed
to
them
dreadful
how
says
i
will
none
answer
me
yet
they
stayed
yet
a
good
while
in
amazement
till
at
last
one
came
to
himself
well
enough
to
ask
who
be
the
gentleman
by
that
i
heard
they
must
be
of
the
swabian
nation
which
men
esteem
as
yet
with
little
cause
so
i
said
i
was
a
travelling
scholar
but
newly
come
from
the
venusberg
where
i
had
learned
a
heap
of
wondrous
arts
oho
quoth
the
eldest
woodman
praise
god
for
now
do
i
believe
that
i
shall
live
to
see
peace
again
because
the
wandering
scholars
are
on
their
travels
anew
how
simplicissimus
wasted
his
spring
in
the
wrong
place
in
this
wise
we
came
to
converse
with
one
another
and
i
found
so
much
courtesy
among
them
that
they
invited
me
to
sit
down
and
offered
me
a
piece
of
black
bread
and
thin
cow
milk
cheese
both
of
which
i
did
thankfully
accept
at
last
they
became
so
familiar
with
me
that
they
hinted
i
should
as
a
travelling
scholar
tell
their
fortunes
and
i
knowing
somewhat
of
physiognomies
and
palmistry
began
to
tell
to
one
after
the
other
such
stuff
as
i
deemed
would
content
them
that
i
might
not
lose
credit
with
them
for
in
spite
of
all
i
was
not
at
my
ease
among
these
wild
woodmen
then
would
they
learn
curious
arts
from
me
but
i
fobbed
them
off
with
promises
for
the
next
day
and
desired
they
would
suffer
me
to
rest
a
little
and
having
so
played
the
gipsy
for
them
i
laid
myself
down
a
little
apart
more
to
listen
and
to
perceive
how
they
were
minded
than
as
having
any
great
desire
to
sleep
though
my
appetite
thereto
was
not
lacking
and
the
more
i
snored
the
more
wakeful
they
appeared
so
they
put
their
heads
together
and
began
to
dispute
one
against
another
who
i
might
be
they
held
that
i
could
be
no
soldier
because
i
wore
black
clothing
nor
no
that
could
so
suddenly
appear
far
from
all
men
dwellings
in
the
muckenloch
for
so
was
the
wood
called
at
so
unwonted
a
time
at
the
last
they
resolved
i
must
be
a
journeyman
latinist
that
had
lost
his
way
or
as
i
myself
had
declared
a
travelling
scholar
because
i
could
so
excellently
tell
fortunes
yea
says
another
yet
he
knew
not
all
for
that
reason
is
some
wandering
soldier
maybe
that
hath
so
disguised
himself
to
spy
out
our
cattle
and
the
secret
ways
of
the
wood
aha
if
we
knew
that
we
would
so
put
him
to
sleep
that
he
should
forget
ever
to
wake
again
but
another
quickly
took
him
up
that
held
the
contrary
and
would
have
me
to
be
somewhat
else
meanwhile
i
lay
there
and
pricked
up
my
ears
and
thought
if
these
clodhoppers
set
upon
me
two
or
three
of
them
will
need
to
bite
the
dust
before
they
make
an
end
of
me
but
while
they
took
counsel
and
i
tormented
myself
with
fears
of
a
sudden
i
found
myself
lying
in
a
pool
of
water
o
horrors
now
was
troy
lost
and
all
my
splendid
plans
gone
to
naught
for
by
the
smell
i
perceived
was
mine
own
mineral
spring
with
that
for
very
rage
and
despite
i
fell
into
such
a
frenzy
that
i
wellnigh
had
fallen
on
those
six
peasants
and
fought
them
all
ye
godless
rogues
says
i
to
them
and
therewith
sprang
up
with
my
terrible
cudgel
by
this
spring
that
welleth
forth
where
i
have
lain
ye
well
may
see
who
i
am
it
were
small
wonder
if
i
should
so
trounce
ye
all
that
the
devil
should
fetch
ye
because
ye
have
dared
to
cherish
such
evil
thoughts
in
your
hearts
and
thereto
i
added
looks
so
threatening
and
terrible
that
all
were
afraid
of
me
yet
presently
i
came
to
myself
and
perceived
what
folly
i
committed
nay
thought
i
is
better
to
lose
the
spring
than
one
life
and
that
thou
canst
easily
forfeit
if
thou
attack
these
clowns
so
i
gave
them
fair
words
again
and
before
they
could
recollect
themselves
arise
said
i
and
taste
of
this
noble
spring
which
ye
and
all
other
woodmen
and
will
henceforth
be
able
to
enjoy
in
this
wilderness
through
my
help
now
this
my
discourse
they
understood
not
but
looked
one
upon
another
like
live
stockfish
till
they
saw
me
very
soberly
take
the
first
draught
out
of
my
hat
then
one
by
one
they
arose
from
beside
their
fire
and
looked
upon
this
miracle
and
tasted
the
water
but
instead
of
being
grateful
to
me
as
they
should
have
been
they
began
to
curse
and
said
they
would
i
had
chanced
on
some
other
spot
with
my
spring
for
if
their
lord
came
to
know
of
it
then
must
the
whole
district
of
dornstett
do
to
make
a
road
thither
which
would
bring
great
hardship
upon
them
but
says
i
on
the
contrary
ye
will
all
have
your
profit
therefrom
for
ye
can
turn
your
fowls
your
eggs
your
butter
and
your
cattle
and
the
rest
more
easily
into
money
nay
nay
said
they
the
lord
will
put
in
an
innkeeper
that
will
take
all
the
profit
alone
and
we
must
be
his
poor
fools
to
keep
road
and
path
in
trim
for
him
and
earn
no
thanks
thereby
but
at
last
they
disagreed
for
two
were
for
keeping
the
spring
and
four
demanded
of
me
that
i
should
take
it
away
which
had
it
been
in
my
power
i
had
willingly
done
whether
it
pleased
them
or
teased
them
so
as
day
began
to
break
and
i
had
no
more
to
do
there
but
must
rather
take
heed
lest
we
came
together
by
the
ears
i
said
that
unless
they
were
minded
that
all
the
cows
in
that
valley
should
give
red
milk
as
long
as
the
spring
flowed
they
must
presently
shew
me
the
way
to
seebach
with
which
they
were
content
and
to
that
end
sent
two
of
them
with
me
for
one
had
feared
to
go
with
me
alone
so
i
departed
thence
and
though
the
whole
land
there
was
barren
and
bore
nothing
but
yet
would
i
with
a
curse
have
made
it
yet
poorer
for
there
i
had
lost
all
my
hopes
yet
went
i
silently
enough
with
my
guides
till
i
came
to
the
top
of
the
hill
where
i
could
a
little
trace
my
way
by
the
lie
of
the
country
and
there
i
said
to
them
now
my
masters
ye
can
turn
your
new
spring
to
fine
profit
if
ye
go
forthwith
and
tell
your
lords
of
its
coming
up
for
that
will
bring
ye
a
rich
reward
seeing
that
the
prince
will
surely
build
about
it
for
the
glory
and
gain
of
the
country
and
for
the
promotion
of
his
own
interest
will
have
it
made
known
to
all
the
world
yea
said
they
fools
should
we
be
in
truth
so
to
bind
rods
for
our
own
backs
we
had
rather
the
devil
would
take
thee
and
thy
spring
too
thou
hast
heard
enough
to
know
why
we
desire
it
not
ah
miscreants
quoth
i
should
i
not
call
ye
disloyal
rogues
that
depart
so
far
from
the
ways
of
your
pious
forefathers
which
were
so
true
to
their
prince
that
he
could
boast
that
he
might
venture
to
lay
his
head
upon
the
knees
of
any
of
his
subjects
and
there
sleep
in
safety
but
ye
blackcaps
to
a
trifling
task
for
which
ye
would
in
time
be
recompensed
and
of
which
all
your
posterity
would
reap
a
rich
reward
ye
be
so
dishonest
as
to
refuse
to
make
known
this
healing
spring
which
were
both
to
the
profit
of
your
worshipful
prince
and
also
to
the
welfare
and
health
of
many
a
sick
man
what
would
it
cost
ye
though
each
should
do
a
few
forced
work
to
that
end
how
said
they
we
would
rather
kill
thee
that
thy
spring
might
remain
unknown
ye
says
i
there
must
be
more
of
ye
for
that
and
therewith
heaved
up
my
cudgel
and
chased
them
to
all
the
devils
and
thereafter
went
my
way
down
hill
westwards
and
southwards
and
so
came
after
much
toil
and
tumble
about
sunset
to
my
farm
and
found
it
true
indeed
what
my
dad
had
prophesied
to
me
namely
that
i
should
get
naught
from
this
pilgrimage
save
weary
legs
and
the
way
back
for
the
way
thither
is
an
uninteresting
excursus
on
certain
communities
of
anabaptists
in
hungary
treats
of
a
trifling
promenade
from
the
black
forest
to
moscow
in
russia
the
same
autumn
there
drew
near
to
us
french
swedish
and
hessian
troops
to
refresh
themselves
among
us
and
to
keep
the
free
city
in
the
neighbourhood
which
was
built
by
an
english
king
and
called
after
his
name
blockaded
for
which
cause
every
man
gathered
together
his
cattle
and
the
best
of
his
goods
and
fled
into
the
woods
among
the
mountains
i
too
did
as
my
neighbours
did
and
left
my
house
pretty
well
empty
wherein
a
swedish
colonel
on
was
lodged
the
same
found
still
remaining
in
my
cabinet
certain
books
for
in
my
haste
i
could
not
bring
all
away
and
among
others
certain
mathematical
and
geometrical
essays
and
also
some
on
fortification
wherewith
our
engineers
be
principally
busied
and
therefore
at
once
concluded
that
his
quarters
could
belong
to
no
common
peasant
and
so
began
to
inquire
of
my
character
and
to
court
my
acquaintance
till
by
courteous
offers
and
threats
intermingled
he
wrought
me
to
it
that
i
should
visit
him
at
mine
own
farm
where
he
treated
me
very
civilly
and
restrained
his
people
that
they
should
do
my
goods
no
unnecessary
damage
or
hurt
and
by
such
friendly
treatment
he
brought
it
about
that
i
told
him
of
all
my
business
and
in
especial
of
my
family
and
descent
thereat
he
wondered
that
i
in
the
midst
of
war
could
so
dwell
among
peasants
and
look
on
while
another
tied
his
horse
to
my
manger
whereas
i
with
more
honour
could
tie
mine
own
horse
to
another
i
should
said
he
gird
on
the
sword
again
and
not
allow
my
gift
which
god
had
bestowed
on
me
to
perish
by
the
fireside
and
behind
the
plough
for
he
knew
if
i
would
enter
the
swedish
service
my
capacity
and
my
knowledge
of
war
would
soon
raise
me
to
high
rank
this
i
treated
but
coldly
and
told
him
advancement
was
ever
far
off
if
a
man
had
no
friends
to
take
him
by
the
hand
whereto
he
replied
that
my
good
qualities
would
soon
procure
me
both
friends
and
advancement
nay
more
he
doubted
not
that
i
should
find
kinsmen
at
the
swedish
headquarters
and
those
of
some
account
for
there
there
were
many
scottish
noblemen
and
men
of
rank
further
said
he
a
regiment
had
been
promised
to
him
himself
by
torstensohn
which
promise
if
it
were
kept
of
which
he
doubted
not
then
would
he
at
once
make
me
his
with
such
and
the
like
words
he
made
my
mouth
to
water
and
inasmuch
as
there
were
now
but
scanty
hopes
of
peace
and
for
me
to
suffer
further
billeting
of
troops
did
but
mean
utter
ruin
therefore
i
resolved
to
serve
again
and
promised
the
colonel
to
go
with
him
if
only
he
would
keep
his
word
and
give
me
the
post
of
in
the
regiment
he
was
to
have
and
so
the
die
was
cast
and
i
sent
for
my
dad
or
which
was
still
with
my
cattle
at
bairischbrunn
and
to
him
and
his
wife
i
devised
my
farm
as
their
own
property
yet
on
condition
that
after
his
death
my
bastard
simplicissimus
that
had
been
laid
at
my
door
should
inherit
it
with
all
appurtenances
since
there
were
no
heirs
born
in
wedlock
thereafter
i
fetched
my
horse
and
all
the
gold
and
trinkets
i
still
had
and
having
settled
all
my
affairs
and
taken
order
for
the
education
of
my
said
of
a
son
on
a
sudden
the
blockade
i
spoke
of
was
raised
so
that
before
we
looked
for
it
we
must
decamp
and
join
the
main
army
under
the
colonel
i
served
as
a
steward
and
maintained
him
with
his
servants
and
horses
and
all
his
household
by
theft
and
robbery
which
is
called
in
soldiers
language
foraging
but
as
to
the
promises
of
torstensohn
of
which
he
had
talked
so
big
at
my
farm
they
were
not
so
great
by
a
good
deal
as
he
had
given
out
but
as
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
rather
looked
at
askance
aha
says
he
to
me
some
malicious
dog
hath
slandered
me
at
headquarters
yet
i
shall
not
need
to
wait
long
but
when
he
suspected
that
i
should
not
endure
to
tarry
longer
with
him
he
forged
letters
as
if
he
had
to
raise
a
fresh
regiment
in
livonia
where
his
home
was
and
persuaded
me
to
embark
with
him
at
wismar
and
to
sail
thither
and
there
too
we
found
naught
for
not
only
had
he
no
regiment
to
raise
but
was
besides
a
nobleman
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
and
what
he
had
came
from
his
wife
yet
though
i
had
now
been
twice
deceived
and
had
suffered
myself
to
be
enticed
so
far
afield
yet
i
took
the
bait
the
third
time
for
he
shewed
me
writings
he
had
received
from
moscow
in
which
as
he
professed
high
commands
in
the
army
were
offered
him
for
so
he
interpreted
the
said
letters
to
me
and
boasted
loudly
of
good
and
punctual
pay
and
seeing
that
he
started
off
with
wife
and
child
i
thought
surely
he
is
on
no
chase
and
so
with
high
hopes
i
took
the
road
with
him
for
otherwise
i
saw
no
means
or
opportunity
to
get
back
to
germany
but
as
soon
as
we
came
over
the
russian
frontier
and
sundry
discharged
german
soldiers
met
us
i
began
to
be
alarmed
and
said
to
my
colonel
what
the
devil
do
we
here
we
leave
the
country
where
war
is
and
where
there
is
peace
and
soldiers
be
of
no
account
and
disbanded
thither
we
come
yet
still
he
gave
me
fair
words
and
said
i
should
leave
it
to
him
he
knew
better
what
he
was
about
than
these
fellows
that
were
of
no
account
but
when
we
came
in
safety
to
the
city
of
moscow
i
saw
at
once
the
game
was
up
is
true
my
colonel
conferred
daily
with
great
men
but
far
more
with
bishops
than
boyars
which
seemed
to
me
not
so
much
grand
as
far
too
monkish
and
aroused
in
me
all
manner
of
fancies
and
reflections
though
i
could
not
conceive
what
he
aimed
at
but
in
the
end
he
revealed
to
me
that
war
was
over
and
that
his
conscience
urged
him
on
to
embrace
the
greek
religion
and
that
his
sincere
advice
to
me
was
inasmuch
as
otherwise
he
could
help
me
no
more
as
he
had
promised
to
follow
his
example
for
his
majesty
the
czar
had
already
good
accounts
of
my
person
and
my
great
capabilities
and
would
be
graciously
pleased
if
i
would
agree
to
the
conditions
to
endow
me
as
a
knight
with
a
fine
estate
and
many
serfs
which
most
gracious
offer
was
not
to
be
rejected
since
for
any
man
it
was
better
to
have
in
so
great
a
monarch
rather
a
gracious
lord
than
an
offended
prince
at
this
i
was
much
confounded
and
knew
not
what
to
answer
for
had
i
had
the
colonel
in
another
place
i
would
have
answered
him
rather
by
deeds
than
words
but
now
i
must
play
my
cards
otherwise
and
consider
the
place
where
i
was
and
where
i
was
like
to
a
prisoner
and
therefore
was
silent
a
long
time
before
i
could
resolve
upon
an
answer
at
length
i
said
to
him
i
had
indeed
come
with
the
purpose
to
serve
the
majesty
as
a
soldier
to
which
he
the
colonel
had
persuaded
me
and
if
my
services
in
war
were
not
needed
i
could
not
help
it
far
less
could
i
lay
it
to
the
charge
of
the
czar
that
i
had
for
his
sake
undertaken
so
long
a
journey
in
vain
for
he
had
not
written
to
me
to
come
but
that
his
majesty
condescended
so
graciously
to
dispense
his
royal
favour
to
me
would
be
a
thing
for
me
rather
to
boast
of
before
all
the
world
than
most
humbly
to
accept
it
and
to
earn
it
since
i
could
not
just
now
determine
to
alter
my
religion
and
only
wished
i
were
dwelling
again
in
my
farm
in
the
black
forest
and
so
causing
no
man
concern
or
inconveniency
to
which
he
replied
your
honour
may
do
as
he
pleases
only
i
had
conceived
that
if
god
and
good
luck
favoured
him
he
would
do
well
to
be
thankful
to
both
but
if
he
will
accept
no
help
and
refuses
to
live
like
a
prince
at
least
i
hope
he
will
believe
that
i
have
spared
no
pains
to
help
him
to
the
best
of
my
ability
thereupon
he
made
me
a
deep
reverence
went
his
way
and
left
me
in
the
lurch
not
allowing
me
even
to
give
him
my
company
to
the
door
so
as
i
sat
there
all
perplexed
and
reviewed
my
present
condition
i
heard
two
russian
carriages
before
our
lodging
and
looking
out
of
the
window
saw
my
good
master
colonel
with
his
sons
enter
the
one
and
his
wife
with
her
daughters
the
other
which
were
the
czar
carriages
and
his
livery
and
divers
priests
there
also
which
waited
upon
this
honourable
family
and
shewed
them
all
kindness
and
good
will
how
simplicissimus
further
fared
in
moscow
from
this
time
i
was
watched
not
openly
indeed
but
secretly
by
certain
soldiers
of
the
strelitz
guard
and
that
without
my
knowledge
and
my
colonel
and
his
family
never
once
came
in
my
sight
so
that
i
knew
not
what
was
become
of
him
and
all
this
as
may
easily
be
thought
brought
in
my
head
strange
conceits
and
many
grey
hairs
also
there
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
germans
that
dwell
in
moscow
some
as
traders
some
as
mechanics
and
to
them
lamented
my
plight
and
how
i
had
been
deceived
by
guile
who
gave
me
comfort
and
direction
how
i
with
a
fair
opportunity
might
return
to
germany
but
so
soon
as
they
got
wind
of
it
that
the
czar
had
determined
to
keep
me
in
the
land
and
would
force
me
to
it
they
all
became
dumb
towards
me
yea
avoided
my
company
and
was
hard
for
me
even
to
find
a
shelter
for
my
head
for
i
had
already
devoured
my
horse
saddle
and
trappings
and
all
and
was
now
doling
out
one
and
another
of
the
ducats
which
i
had
wisely
sewn
into
my
clothes
at
last
i
began
to
turn
into
money
my
rings
and
trinkets
in
the
hope
to
keep
myself
so
until
i
could
find
a
fair
occasion
to
get
back
to
germany
meanwhile
a
quarter
of
a
year
was
gone
after
which
the
said
colonel
with
all
his
household
was
baptized
again
and
provided
with
a
fine
nobleman
estate
and
many
serfs
at
that
time
there
went
out
a
decree
that
both
among
natives
and
foreigners
no
idlers
should
be
allowed
and
that
with
heavy
penalties
as
those
that
took
the
bread
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
workers
and
all
strangers
that
would
not
work
must
quit
the
country
in
a
month
and
the
town
in
hours
with
that
some
fifty
of
us
joined
together
with
intent
to
make
our
way
with
god
help
through
podolia
to
germany
yet
were
we
not
two
hours
gone
from
the
town
when
we
were
caught
up
by
certain
russian
troopers
on
the
pretence
that
his
majesty
was
greatly
displeased
that
we
had
impudently
dared
to
band
together
in
such
great
numbers
and
to
traverse
his
land
at
pleasure
without
passports
saying
further
that
his
majesty
would
not
be
going
beyond
his
rights
in
sending
us
all
to
siberia
for
our
insolent
conduct
on
the
way
back
i
learned
how
my
business
stood
for
the
commander
of
the
troop
told
me
plainly
the
czar
would
not
let
me
forth
of
the
country
and
his
sincere
advice
was
that
i
should
obey
his
majesty
most
gracious
will
and
join
their
religion
and
as
the
colonel
had
done
not
despise
a
fine
estate
assuring
me
also
that
if
i
refused
this
and
would
not
live
among
them
as
a
lord
i
must
needs
stay
as
a
servant
against
my
will
nor
must
his
majesty
be
blamed
that
he
would
not
allow
to
depart
from
his
country
a
man
so
skilful
as
the
colonel
had
reported
me
to
be
then
did
i
disparage
mine
own
worth
and
said
the
honourable
colonel
must
surely
have
ascribed
to
me
more
arts
virtues
and
knowledge
than
i
possessed
was
true
indeed
i
had
come
into
the
land
to
serve
his
majesty
the
czar
and
the
worshipful
russian
people
even
at
the
risk
of
my
life
against
their
enemies
but
to
change
my
religion
to
that
i
could
not
resolve
me
yet
so
far
as
i
could
in
any
wise
serve
his
majesty
without
burdening
my
conscience
i
would
not
fail
to
do
my
utmost
endeavour
then
was
i
set
apart
from
the
rest
and
lodged
with
a
merchant
where
i
was
openly
watched
yet
daily
provisioned
from
the
court
with
rich
food
and
costly
liquors
and
also
daily
had
visitors
that
talked
with
me
and
now
and
again
would
invite
me
as
a
guest
in
especial
there
was
one
to
whose
charge
i
had
without
doubt
been
chiefly
commended
a
crafty
man
that
entertained
me
daily
with
friendly
talk
for
now
could
i
speak
russian
pretty
well
so
he
discoursed
with
me
oftentimes
of
all
manner
of
mechanic
arts
as
well
as
of
engines
of
war
and
others
and
of
fortification
and
artillery
practice
at
last
after
much
beating
about
the
bush
to
find
out
whether
i
would
give
in
to
his
master
wishes
when
he
found
there
was
no
hope
of
my
changing
even
in
the
least
point
he
begged
that
i
would
for
the
honour
of
the
great
czar
impart
and
communicate
to
their
nation
somewhat
of
my
science
for
his
majesty
would
requite
my
complaisance
with
high
and
royal
favours
to
which
i
answered
my
desires
had
ever
been
to
that
end
most
dutifully
to
serve
the
czar
seeing
that
for
this
purpose
i
had
come
into
his
country
albeit
i
perceived
that
i
was
kept
like
a
prisoner
but
he
replied
nay
nay
sir
ye
be
no
prisoner
but
his
majesty
doth
hold
ye
so
dear
that
he
can
not
resolve
to
part
with
your
person
so
says
i
wherefore
then
am
i
guarded
because
he
answered
his
majesty
feareth
lest
any
harm
should
happen
to
ye
so
now
understanding
my
proposals
he
said
the
czar
was
graciously
pleased
to
consider
of
digging
for
saltpetre
in
his
own
country
and
making
of
powder
there
but
because
there
was
no
one
in
the
land
that
could
deal
with
the
matter
i
should
do
him
an
acceptable
service
if
i
would
undertake
the
work
to
that
end
i
should
be
provided
with
men
and
means
enough
ready
to
hand
and
he
in
his
own
person
would
most
sincerely
beg
of
me
not
to
reject
such
a
gracious
proposal
seeing
that
they
were
already
well
assured
that
i
had
a
full
knowledge
of
such
matters
to
which
i
answered
sir
i
say
as
i
said
before
if
i
can
serve
his
majesty
in
anything
provided
only
he
will
be
graciously
content
to
leave
me
undisturbed
in
my
religion
i
will
not
fail
to
do
my
best
whereat
the
russian
which
was
one
of
their
chief
magnates
was
heartily
glad
and
pledged
me
in
drink
deeper
than
ever
a
german
next
day
there
came
from
the
czar
two
great
nobles
with
an
interpreter
to
make
a
final
agreement
with
me
and
presented
me
on
behalf
of
the
czar
with
a
costly
russian
robe
and
a
few
days
after
i
began
to
seek
for
saltpetre
and
to
instruct
the
russians
that
had
been
assigned
to
me
how
to
separate
it
from
the
earth
and
refine
it
and
at
the
same
time
i
drew
up
a
plan
of
a
and
taught
others
to
burn
charcoal
so
that
in
brief
space
we
had
ready
a
goodly
amount
both
of
musquet
and
ordnance
powder
for
i
had
people
enough
besides
mine
own
servants
that
were
to
wait
on
me
or
to
speak
more
truly
to
keep
watch
and
ward
over
me
i
being
thus
well
started
there
comes
to
me
the
colonel
in
russian
clothes
and
nobly
escorted
by
many
servants
without
doubt
by
such
a
show
of
glory
to
persuade
me
to
go
over
to
that
religion
but
i
knew
well
that
the
clothes
came
from
the
czar
his
wardrobe
and
were
but
lent
him
to
make
my
mouth
water
for
is
the
commonest
of
customs
at
the
russian
court
and
that
the
reader
may
understand
how
is
managed
i
will
give
him
an
instance
of
mine
own
self
for
once
was
i
busied
with
taking
order
at
the
which
i
caused
to
be
built
on
the
river
outside
moscow
as
to
what
task
one
and
the
other
of
the
people
assigned
to
me
should
perform
that
day
and
the
next
when
of
a
sudden
there
was
an
alarm
that
the
tartars
horse
strong
were
but
four
miles
away
plundering
the
country
and
advancing
continually
so
must
i
and
my
people
needs
betake
ourselves
to
the
palace
to
be
equipped
out
of
the
czar
armoury
and
stables
and
i
for
my
part
in
place
of
a
cuirass
was
clad
in
a
quilted
silk
breastplate
that
would
stop
any
arrow
but
could
not
keep
out
any
bullet
moreover
boots
and
spurs
and
a
princely
with
a
heron
plume
and
a
sabre
that
would
split
a
hair
mounted
with
pure
gold
and
studded
with
precious
stones
were
given
to
me
and
of
the
czar
horses
such
an
one
was
put
between
my
legs
as
i
had
never
seen
the
like
of
in
my
life
far
less
ridden
so
i
and
my
horses
blazed
with
gold
silver
pearls
and
precious
stones
i
had
a
steel
mace
hanging
by
me
that
shone
like
a
mirror
and
was
so
well
made
and
heavy
that
i
had
easily
beaten
to
death
any
that
i
dealt
a
blow
with
it
so
that
the
czar
himself
could
not
ride
into
battle
better
equipped
and
there
followed
me
a
white
standard
with
a
double
eagle
to
which
the
people
flocked
from
all
sides
and
corners
so
that
before
two
hours
were
over
we
were
forty
thousand
strong
and
after
four
hours
nigh
sixty
thousand
with
whom
we
marched
against
the
tartars
and
every
quarter
of
an
hour
i
had
my
orders
from
the
czar
which
yet
were
but
this
that
i
should
this
day
approve
myself
a
soldier
having
given
myself
out
for
one
that
his
majesty
might
as
such
esteem
and
recognise
me
so
every
moment
our
troop
was
increased
with
great
and
small
soldiers
and
officers
yet
in
all
this
haste
could
i
discover
none
that
should
command
the
whole
body
or
array
the
battle
it
needs
not
that
i
should
tell
all
for
my
story
is
not
much
concerned
with
this
encounter
i
will
but
say
this
only
that
we
came
suddenly
upon
the
tartars
in
a
valley
or
deep
dip
in
the
land
encumbered
with
tired
horses
and
much
booty
and
least
of
all
expecting
us
whom
we
attacked
on
all
sides
with
such
fury
that
at
the
very
onset
we
scattered
them
there
at
the
first
attack
i
called
to
my
followers
in
the
russian
speech
come
now
let
each
do
as
i
do
and
that
they
all
shouted
to
one
another
while
i
with
a
loose
rein
charged
at
the
enemy
and
of
the
first
i
met
which
was
a
mirza
or
son
i
cleft
the
head
in
twain
so
that
his
brains
were
left
hanging
on
my
steel
mace
this
heroical
example
did
the
russians
follow
so
that
the
tartars
might
not
withstand
their
attack
but
turned
to
a
general
flight
while
i
dealt
like
a
madman
or
rather
like
one
that
from
desperation
seeketh
death
and
can
not
find
it
for
i
smote
down
all
that
came
before
me
tartar
and
russian
alike
and
they
that
were
commanded
by
the
czar
to
watch
me
followed
me
so
hard
that
i
had
ever
my
back
guarded
there
was
the
air
so
full
of
arrows
as
it
had
been
swarms
of
bees
of
which
my
share
was
one
in
the
arm
for
i
had
turned
back
my
sleeve
that
so
with
less
hindrance
i
might
use
my
sword
and
came
to
cleave
and
batter
and
until
i
received
the
wound
my
heart
did
laugh
within
me
at
such
bloodshed
but
when
i
saw
mine
own
blood
flow
that
laughter
was
turned
into
a
mad
fury
so
when
these
savage
foes
had
been
put
to
flight
it
was
commanded
me
by
divers
nobles
in
the
name
of
the
czar
that
i
should
carry
to
their
emperor
the
news
how
the
tartars
had
been
defeated
and
at
their
bidding
i
rode
back
with
some
hundred
horsemen
at
my
heels
with
whom
i
rode
through
the
town
to
the
czar
palace
and
was
by
all
men
received
with
triumph
and
gratulation
but
so
soon
as
i
had
made
my
report
of
the
battle
albeit
the
czar
had
already
news
of
all
that
happened
i
must
again
doff
my
princely
apparel
which
was
again
stored
away
in
the
czar
his
wardrobe
though
both
it
and
the
horse
trappings
were
bespattered
and
befouled
all
over
with
blood
and
so
almost
entirely
ruinated
whereas
i
had
thought
since
i
had
borne
myself
so
knightly
in
the
encounter
the
clothes
should
at
least
have
been
left
me
together
with
the
horse
for
a
reward
but
from
this
i
could
well
judge
how
was
managed
with
the
russian
robe
of
state
of
which
my
colonel
made
use
for
is
all
but
lent
finery
which
like
all
else
in
russia
pertaineth
to
the
czar
alone
by
what
a
short
and
merry
road
he
came
home
to
his
dad
now
as
long
as
my
wound
was
is
true
i
was
treated
like
a
prince
for
i
walked
abroad
at
all
times
clad
in
a
furred
gown
of
cloth
of
gold
lined
with
sables
though
the
wound
was
neither
mortal
nor
dangerous
and
in
all
the
days
of
my
life
i
have
never
tasted
such
rich
foods
as
then
but
this
was
all
the
reward
i
had
for
my
labours
save
the
praise
which
the
czar
favoured
me
with
and
this
too
was
spoiled
for
me
by
the
envy
of
certain
nobles
so
now
being
completely
sound
again
was
i
sent
down
the
volga
in
a
ship
to
astrachan
to
set
up
a
there
as
in
moscow
for
was
not
possible
for
the
czar
to
furnish
these
frontier
fortresses
from
moscow
with
fresh
and
good
powder
which
must
needs
be
carried
by
water
and
that
with
great
risk
and
this
service
i
willingly
undertook
for
i
had
promises
that
the
czar
after
the
accomplishment
of
such
business
would
send
me
back
to
holland
and
that
with
a
good
reward
in
money
proportionable
to
my
services
but
alas
when
we
think
we
stand
safest
and
most
certain
in
the
hopes
and
conceits
we
have
formed
there
comes
a
wind
unawares
and
in
a
wink
blows
away
all
the
flimsy
stuff
whereon
we
had
founded
our
hopes
so
long
yet
the
governor
of
astrachan
treated
me
like
the
czar
himself
and
in
brief
space
i
had
all
on
a
good
footing
his
old
ammunition
which
was
quite
spoiled
and
ruined
and
could
do
no
harm
to
any
i
refounded
as
a
tinker
makes
new
tin
spoons
out
of
old
ones
which
was
then
a
thing
unheard
of
among
the
russians
by
reason
of
which
and
other
arts
of
mine
some
held
me
to
be
a
sorcerer
others
a
new
saint
or
prophet
and
others
again
for
a
second
empedocles
or
gorgias
leontinus
but
being
hard
at
work
and
busied
at
night
in
a
outside
the
fortifications
i
was
in
thievish
wise
captured
and
carried
off
by
a
horde
of
tartars
which
took
me
with
others
so
far
into
their
country
that
i
not
only
could
see
the
herb
borametz
or
growing
but
did
even
eat
thereof
which
is
a
most
strange
vegetable
for
it
is
like
a
sheep
to
look
upon
its
wool
can
be
spun
and
woven
like
natural
sheep
wool
and
its
flesh
is
so
like
to
mutton
that
even
the
wolves
do
love
to
eat
thereof
but
they
that
had
captivated
me
did
barter
me
away
for
certain
wares
of
china
to
the
tartars
of
nuichi
which
again
presented
me
as
a
rare
gift
to
the
king
of
corea
with
whom
they
had
but
then
made
a
truce
and
there
was
i
highly
valued
for
there
could
none
be
found
like
me
in
the
handling
of
sword
and
rapier
and
there
i
taught
the
king
how
with
his
piece
over
his
shoulder
and
his
back
turned
to
the
target
he
could
yet
hit
the
in
reward
for
which
at
my
humble
petition
he
gave
me
my
liberty
again
and
let
me
go
by
way
of
japonia
to
the
portuguese
of
macao
which
made
but
small
count
of
me
so
i
went
about
among
them
like
a
sheep
that
has
strayed
from
the
flock
till
at
last
in
marvellous
fashion
i
was
captured
by
turkish
corsairs
and
by
them
after
they
had
dragged
me
about
with
them
for
a
full
year
among
strange
foreign
nations
that
do
inhabit
the
isles
of
the
east
indies
sold
to
certain
merchants
of
alexandria
in
egypt
these
carried
me
with
their
wares
to
constantinople
and
because
the
turkish
emperor
was
just
then
fitting
out
galleys
against
the
venetians
and
needed
rowers
therefore
must
many
turkish
merchants
part
with
their
christian
slaves
yet
for
ready
payment
among
whom
i
was
one
as
being
a
strong
young
fellow
and
now
must
i
learn
to
row
which
heavy
task
nevertheless
endured
not
more
than
two
months
for
our
galley
was
in
the
levant
right
valiantly
overcome
by
the
venetians
and
i
with
all
my
companions
freed
from
the
power
of
the
turks
and
the
said
galley
being
brought
to
venice
with
rich
booty
and
divers
turkish
prisoners
of
high
degree
i
was
set
at
liberty
as
wishing
to
go
to
rome
and
on
pilgrimage
to
loretto
to
view
those
places
and
to
thank
god
for
my
deliverance
to
which
end
i
easily
obtained
a
passport
and
moreover
from
several
honourable
persons
especially
germans
reasonable
help
in
money
so
that
now
i
could
provide
me
with
a
pilgrim
staff
and
enter
on
my
journey
so
i
betook
me
by
the
nearest
way
to
rome
where
i
fared
right
well
for
both
from
great
and
small
i
got
me
much
alms
and
tarrying
there
nigh
six
weeks
i
took
my
way
with
other
pilgrims
of
whom
some
germans
and
especially
certain
switzers
to
loretto
from
whence
i
came
over
the
saint
gotthard
pass
back
through
switzerland
to
my
dad
which
had
kept
my
farm
for
me
and
nothing
remarkable
did
i
bring
home
save
a
beard
which
i
had
grown
in
foreign
parts
now
had
i
been
absent
three
years
and
some
months
during
which
time
i
had
fared
over
the
most
distant
seas
and
seen
all
manner
of
peoples
but
had
commonly
received
from
them
more
evil
than
good
of
which
a
whole
book
might
be
writ
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
westphalian
treaty
had
been
concluded
so
that
i
could
now
live
with
my
dad
in
peace
and
quiet
and
him
i
left
to
manage
and
to
keep
house
but
for
myself
i
sat
down
to
my
books
which
were
now
both
my
work
and
my
delight
is
very
short
and
concerneth
simplicissimus
alone
once
did
i
read
how
the
oracle
of
apollo
gave
as
answer
to
the
roman
deputies
when
they
asked
what
they
must
do
to
rule
their
subjects
in
peace
this
only
nosce
teipsum
which
signifieth
let
each
man
know
himself
this
caused
me
to
reflect
upon
the
past
and
demand
of
myself
an
account
of
the
life
i
had
led
for
i
had
naught
else
to
do
so
said
i
to
myself
thy
life
hath
been
no
life
but
a
death
thy
days
a
toilsome
shadow
thy
years
a
troublous
dream
thy
pleasures
grievous
sins
thy
youth
a
fantasy
and
thy
happiness
an
alchemist
treasure
that
is
gone
by
the
chimney
and
vanished
ere
thou
canst
perceive
it
through
many
dangers
thou
hast
followed
the
wars
and
in
the
same
encountered
much
good
and
ill
luck
hast
been
now
high
now
low
now
great
now
small
now
rich
now
poor
now
merry
now
sorry
now
loved
now
hated
now
honoured
now
despised
but
now
poor
soul
what
hast
thou
gained
from
thy
long
pilgrimage
this
hast
thou
gained
i
am
poor
in
goods
my
heart
is
burdened
with
cares
for
all
good
purposes
i
am
idle
lazy
and
spoilt
and
worst
of
all
my
conscience
is
heavy
and
vexed
but
thou
my
soul
art
overwhelmed
with
sin
and
grievously
defiled
the
body
is
weary
the
understanding
bemused
thine
innocence
is
gone
the
best
years
of
youth
are
past
the
precious
time
lost
naught
is
there
that
gives
me
pleasure
and
withal
i
am
an
enemy
to
myself
but
when
i
came
after
my
sainted
father
death
into
the
great
world
then
was
i
and
pure
upright
and
honest
truthful
humble
modest
temperate
chaste
pious
and
religious
but
soon
became
malicious
false
treacherous
proud
restless
and
above
all
altogether
godless
all
which
vices
i
did
learn
without
a
teacher
mine
honour
have
i
guarded
not
for
its
own
sake
but
for
mine
own
exaltation
i
took
note
of
time
not
to
employ
it
well
for
mine
own
soul
welfare
but
for
the
profit
of
my
body
my
life
have
i
often
put
in
jeopardy
and
yet
i
have
never
busied
myself
to
better
it
that
i
might
die
blest
and
comforted
for
i
looked
only
to
the
present
and
to
my
temporal
profit
and
never
once
thought
on
the
future
much
less
remembered
that
i
must
some
time
give
an
account
before
the
face
of
god
almighty
with
such
thoughts
i
tormented
myself
daily
and
just
then
there
came
into
my
hands
certain
writings
of
the
franciscan
friar
quevara
of
which
i
must
here
set
down
some
for
they
were
of
such
power
as
fully
to
disgust
me
with
the
world
why
and
in
what
fashion
simplicissimus
left
the
world
again
the
first
part
of
the
chapter
is
a
fair
translation
extending
to
many
pages
of
quevara
somewhat
trite
reflections
on
the
vanity
of
a
worldly
life
it
is
taken
from
albertini
translation
of
a
book
called
of
the
burden
and
annoyance
of
a
courtier
life
amberg
the
only
part
of
the
chapter
which
concerns
the
story
is
as
follows
all
these
words
i
pondered
carefully
and
with
continual
thought
and
they
so
pierced
my
heart
that
i
left
the
world
again
and
became
a
hermit
fain
would
i
have
dwelt
by
my
spring
in
the
muckenloch
but
the
peasants
that
dwelt
near
would
not
suffer
it
though
it
had
been
for
me
a
wilderness
to
my
taste
for
they
feared
i
should
reveal
the
spring
and
so
move
their
lord
to
force
them
to
make
highways
and
byways
thither
especially
now
that
peace
was
secured
so
i
betook
myself
to
another
wilderness
and
began
again
my
old
life
in
the
spessart
but
whether
i
shall
like
my
father
of
blessed
memory
persevere
therein
to
the
end
i
know
not
god
grant
us
all
his
grace
that
we
may
all
alike
obtain
from
him
what
doth
concern
us
most
namely
a
happy
end
appendices
appendix
a
the
success
of
simplicissimus
induced
grimmelshausen
to
publish
a
continuatio
or
sequel
which
certainly
does
not
seem
to
have
been
contemplated
when
he
wrote
the
last
chapter
of
the
original
work
it
as
well
as
three
lesser
continuations
which
were
published
later
is
entirely
unworthy
of
the
author
though
all
four
seem
to
be
genuine
products
of
his
pen
it
is
a
string
of
allegories
ghost
stories
fables
and
monotonous
chronicles
of
adventure
not
redeemed
from
dulness
by
occasional
gross
filth
for
one
reason
only
it
deserves
our
attention
the
curious
anticipation
of
the
story
of
robinson
crusoe
which
is
contained
in
chapters
xix
to
xxii
a
subjoined
relation
of
jean
cornelissen
of
harlem
gives
an
account
of
his
finding
simplicissimus
and
leaving
him
on
his
island
well
provided
with
necessaries
but
this
narrative
is
so
overloaded
with
childish
stories
of
the
castaway
miraculous
powers
and
performances
that
an
abstract
of
it
only
is
here
given
at
the
end
from
the
middle
of
chapter
xix
to
the
end
of
chapter
xxiii
is
fully
translated
continuation
how
simplicissimus
and
a
carpenter
escaped
from
a
shipwreck
with
their
lives
and
were
thereafter
provided
with
a
land
of
their
own
so
taking
ship
and
coming
from
the
sinus
arabicus
or
red
sea
into
the
ocean
and
having
a
fair
wind
we
held
our
course
to
pass
by
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
sailed
for
some
weeks
so
happily
that
way
that
we
could
have
desired
no
other
weather
but
when
we
deemed
that
we
were
now
over
against
the
isle
of
madagascar
there
suddenly
arose
such
a
hurricane
that
we
had
scarce
time
to
take
in
sail
and
the
storm
increasing
we
must
needs
cut
down
the
mast
and
leave
the
ship
to
the
mercy
of
the
waves
which
carried
us
up
as
it
were
to
the
clouds
and
in
a
trice
plunged
us
down
again
to
the
depths
all
which
lasted
a
full
and
taught
us
all
to
pray
most
piously
at
length
were
we
cast
upon
a
sunken
reef
with
such
force
that
the
ship
with
a
terrible
crack
broke
all
in
pieces
at
which
there
arose
a
lamentable
and
piteous
outcry
then
was
the
sea
in
a
moment
strown
with
chests
bales
and
fragments
of
the
ship
and
then
one
could
hear
and
see
the
unlucky
folk
here
and
there
some
on
and
some
under
the
waves
clinging
to
anything
that
in
such
need
came
first
within
their
grasp
and
with
dismal
cries
lamenting
their
ruin
and
commending
of
their
souls
to
god
but
i
with
the
ship
carpenter
lay
upon
a
great
timber
of
the
vessel
which
had
certain
yet
fast
to
it
to
which
we
clung
and
spake
to
one
another
and
little
by
little
the
dreadful
wind
abated
the
raging
waves
of
the
angry
sea
grew
calmer
and
less
yet
on
the
other
hand
there
followed
night
with
terrible
rain
till
it
seemed
as
if
we
should
be
drowned
from
above
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
this
endured
till
midnight
by
which
time
we
had
been
in
sore
straits
but
then
was
the
sky
clear
again
so
that
we
could
see
the
stars
by
which
we
perceived
that
the
wind
drove
us
more
and
more
from
the
coast
of
africa
towards
the
open
sea
and
the
unknown
land
of
australia
which
troubled
us
both
greatly
now
towards
daybreak
it
grew
dark
again
so
that
we
could
not
see
each
other
though
we
lay
close
at
hand
and
in
this
darkness
and
piteous
plight
we
drove
ever
onward
till
of
a
sudden
we
were
aware
that
we
were
aground
and
stuck
fast
so
the
carpenter
which
had
an
axe
hanging
to
his
girdle
tried
with
it
the
depth
of
the
water
and
found
it
on
the
one
side
of
us
not
a
foot
deep
which
heartily
rejoiced
us
and
gave
us
sure
hope
that
god
had
in
some
way
helped
us
to
land
as
we
perceived
by
a
sweet
odour
that
we
smelt
as
soon
as
we
came
to
ourselves
a
little
yet
because
was
dark
and
we
both
wearied
out
and
in
especial
looked
presently
for
daylight
we
had
not
courage
enough
to
commit
ourselves
to
the
sea
and
make
for
land
notwithstanding
we
already
thought
to
hear
at
a
distance
the
song
of
divers
birds
which
indeed
was
so
but
as
soon
as
the
blessed
daylight
shewed
itself
in
the
east
we
saw
through
the
dusk
a
small
island
overgrown
with
bushes
lying
close
before
us
whereupon
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
water
on
that
side
which
grew
shallower
and
shallower
till
at
length
with
great
joy
we
came
to
dry
land
so
there
we
fell
on
our
knees
and
kissed
the
ground
and
thanked
god
above
for
his
fatherly
care
in
bringing
of
us
to
land
and
in
such
fashion
did
i
come
to
my
island
as
yet
could
we
not
know
whether
we
were
in
an
inhabited
or
an
uninhabited
land
and
whether
on
the
mainland
or
an
island
but
this
we
marked
at
once
that
it
must
be
a
right
fertile
soil
for
all
was
overgrown
thick
with
shrubs
and
trees
like
a
so
that
we
could
hardly
come
through
it
but
when
it
was
now
broad
day
and
we
had
made
our
way
through
the
shrubs
some
quarter
of
an
hour
march
from
the
shore
we
could
not
only
find
no
trace
of
human
dwelling
but
moreover
lighted
here
and
there
upon
many
strange
birds
that
had
no
fear
of
us
but
suffered
us
to
take
them
with
our
hands
from
all
which
we
might
judge
we
were
on
an
uninhabited
island
yet
most
fruitful
there
did
we
find
citrons
pomegranates
and
cocoanuts
with
which
fruits
we
refreshed
ourselves
right
well
and
when
the
sun
rose
we
came
to
a
plain
covered
with
from
which
palm
wine
is
made
the
which
was
but
too
pleasing
to
my
comrade
who
loved
the
same
more
than
was
good
for
him
so
there
we
set
ourselves
down
in
the
sun
to
dry
our
clothes
which
we
stripped
off
and
to
that
end
hung
them
on
the
trees
but
for
our
own
parts
walked
about
in
our
shirts
and
my
carpenter
cutting
a
with
his
axe
found
it
was
full
of
wine
yet
had
we
no
vessel
to
catch
it
in
and
for
our
hats
we
had
lost
them
both
in
the
shipwreck
so
the
kindly
sun
having
dried
our
clothes
again
we
put
them
on
and
climbed
up
the
high
rocky
mountain
that
lieth
on
the
right
hand
towards
the
north
between
this
plain
and
the
sea
and
looking
about
us
found
that
we
were
on
no
mainland
but
on
this
island
which
in
circuit
exceeded
not
an
hour
and
a
half
journey
and
because
we
could
see
neither
near
nor
far
off
any
land
but
only
sea
and
sky
we
were
both
troubled
and
lost
all
hope
ever
to
see
mankind
again
yet
contrariwise
it
did
comfort
us
that
the
goodness
of
god
had
brought
us
to
this
land
both
safe
and
most
fruitful
and
not
to
a
place
that
belike
would
prove
barren
or
inhabited
of
so
we
began
to
consider
of
our
way
to
act
and
because
we
must
live
even
as
prisoners
on
this
island
with
one
another
we
did
swear
perpetual
fidelity
each
to
each
now
on
the
said
mountain
there
not
only
sat
and
flew
many
birds
of
divers
kinds
but
it
was
so
full
of
nests
with
eggs
that
we
could
not
sufficiently
marvel
thereat
of
these
eggs
we
did
eat
some
and
took
still
more
with
us
down
the
hill
on
which
we
found
the
spring
of
sweet
water
which
flows
into
the
sea
towards
the
east
with
such
force
that
it
might
well
turn
a
small
at
which
we
rejoiced
anew
and
resolved
to
set
up
our
abode
beside
the
said
spring
yet
for
our
new
housekeeping
we
had
no
other
furniture
but
an
axe
a
spoon
three
knives
a
prong
or
fork
and
a
pair
of
scissors
and
nothing
more
is
true
my
comrade
had
some
thirty
ducats
about
him
but
these
we
had
gladly
bartered
for
a
had
we
known
where
to
buy
one
for
they
were
of
no
use
to
us
at
all
yea
less
than
my
which
was
still
full
of
priming
this
did
i
dry
for
it
was
all
like
a
soft
cake
in
the
sun
scattered
some
upon
a
stone
covered
it
with
stuff
such
as
the
moss
and
cotton
which
the
furnished
in
plenty
and
then
drawing
a
knife
sharply
through
the
powder
kindled
it
which
rejoiced
us
as
much
as
our
rescue
from
the
sea
and
had
we
but
had
salt
and
bread
and
vessels
to
hold
our
drink
we
had
esteemed
ourselves
the
luckiest
fellows
in
the
world
though
hours
before
we
might
have
been
counted
among
the
most
miserable
so
good
and
faithful
and
merciful
is
god
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
then
we
caught
some
birds
forthwith
of
which
whole
flocks
flew
about
us
plucked
washed
and
stuck
them
on
a
wooden
spit
and
so
i
began
to
turn
the
roast
while
my
comrade
fetched
me
wood
and
prepared
a
shelter
that
if
it
should
come
on
to
rain
again
might
protect
us
from
the
same
for
these
indian
rains
in
the
parts
towards
africa
are
wont
to
be
very
unhealthy
but
our
lack
of
salt
we
supplied
with
to
give
a
flavour
to
our
food
how
they
hired
a
fair
cookmaid
and
by
god
help
were
rid
of
her
again
this
was
the
first
meal
of
which
we
partook
upon
our
island
and
having
ended
it
we
had
naught
else
to
do
but
gather
dry
wood
to
keep
up
our
fire
we
would
fain
have
explored
the
whole
island
at
once
but
by
reason
of
the
fatigue
we
had
passed
through
sleep
so
overpowered
us
that
we
must
needs
lie
down
to
rest
and
sleep
till
broad
daylight
and
finding
it
so
we
walked
down
the
brook
or
glade
as
far
as
its
mouth
where
it
flows
into
the
sea
and
saw
with
amazement
how
a
great
multitude
of
fish
of
the
size
of
middling
salmon
or
large
carp
swam
up
the
little
river
into
the
fresh
water
so
that
it
seemed
as
a
great
herd
of
swine
were
driven
violently
in
and
finding
also
certain
bananas
and
sweet
potatoes
which
be
excellent
fruits
we
said
to
each
other
we
had
surely
found
the
land
of
cocaigne
or
monkeys
paradise
though
no
beast
there
if
we
had
but
company
to
help
us
to
enjoy
both
the
fruitfulness
of
this
noble
island
and
also
the
plenty
of
birds
and
fishes
on
it
yet
could
we
find
no
single
sign
that
ever
men
had
been
there
but
as
we
began
to
take
counsel
how
we
should
further
order
our
housekeeping
and
whence
we
might
have
vessels
wherein
both
to
cook
and
to
catch
the
juice
from
the
palms
and
let
it
ferment
in
its
own
fashion
that
we
might
have
the
full
enjoyment
of
it
and
as
we
walked
on
the
shore
in
talk
of
this
we
saw
far
out
at
sea
something
that
tossed
about
which
we
at
a
distance
could
not
make
out
though
it
seemed
bigger
than
it
really
was
for
when
it
came
near
and
was
driven
ashore
on
the
coast
of
the
island
it
proved
to
be
a
woman
lying
on
a
chest
and
with
both
hands
fast
clasped
to
the
handles
of
it
her
for
christian
charity
we
drew
to
dry
land
and
dreaming
her
to
be
a
christian
woman
of
abyssinia
both
by
her
clothing
and
certain
marks
she
had
on
her
face
we
were
the
more
busy
to
bring
her
to
to
which
end
yet
with
all
honesty
as
becomes
them
that
deal
with
modest
women
in
such
a
case
we
set
her
on
her
head
till
a
good
deal
of
water
had
run
out
of
her
and
albeit
we
had
no
cordial
to
revive
her
more
than
our
yet
we
ceased
not
to
press
under
her
nose
that
spirituous
liquor
which
is
found
at
the
very
end
of
the
and
to
shake
and
move
her
about
till
at
last
she
began
to
stir
of
herself
and
to
speak
in
portuguese
which
as
soon
as
my
comrade
heard
and
as
a
lively
colour
began
to
shew
itself
in
her
face
he
said
to
me
this
abyssinian
was
once
on
our
ship
as
maid
to
a
portuguese
lady
of
quality
for
i
knew
them
both
well
they
dwelt
at
macao
and
were
purposed
to
sail
with
us
to
the
isle
of
annabon
and
she
so
soon
as
she
heard
him
speak
shewed
herself
right
glad
and
called
him
by
name
and
told
us
not
only
of
her
whole
journey
but
how
she
was
rejoiced
both
that
he
and
she
were
still
alive
as
also
that
they
had
as
old
acquaintances
met
on
dry
land
and
out
of
all
danger
at
that
my
carpenter
asked
what
manner
of
wares
might
be
in
the
chest
to
which
she
answered
they
were
certain
parcels
of
chinese
apparel
with
firearms
and
weapons
besides
divers
vessels
of
porcelain
both
small
and
great
that
should
have
been
sent
by
her
master
to
a
great
prince
in
portugal
at
which
news
we
rejoiced
greatly
seeing
that
these
were
the
things
which
we
most
needed
then
did
she
beg
of
us
that
we
would
shew
her
kindness
and
keep
her
with
us
for
she
would
gladly
serve
us
in
cooking
washing
and
other
duties
of
a
maid
and
obey
us
as
a
slave
if
we
would
but
keep
her
under
our
protection
and
suffer
her
to
partake
with
us
of
the
sustenance
which
fortune
and
nature
provided
in
that
place
so
with
great
toil
and
trouble
we
dragged
the
chest
to
that
place
which
we
had
chosen
for
our
dwelling
where
we
did
open
it
and
found
therein
things
so
fitted
to
our
needs
that
we
could
have
desired
nothing
better
for
our
then
condition
and
for
the
use
of
our
household
these
goods
we
unpacked
and
dried
them
in
the
sun
in
which
business
our
new
maid
shewed
herself
diligent
and
serviceable
and
thereafter
we
began
to
slay
boil
and
roast
birds
and
while
my
carpenter
went
to
fetch
i
climbed
up
the
mountain
to
gather
eggs
for
us
meaning
to
boil
them
hard
and
to
use
them
in
place
of
good
bread
and
as
i
went
i
considered
with
hearty
gratitude
the
great
gifts
and
goodness
of
god
that
had
with
such
fatherly
kindness
caused
his
providence
to
watch
over
us
and
gave
us
the
promise
of
further
help
there
did
i
fall
upon
my
face
and
stretching
out
my
arms
and
lifting
up
my
heart
to
god
i
prayed
thus
o
heavenly
father
of
all
mercies
now
do
i
find
indeed
that
thou
art
more
ready
to
give
than
we
to
ask
yea
dearest
lord
thou
hast
with
the
fulness
of
thy
divine
riches
supplied
us
more
quickly
and
more
plentifully
than
we
poor
creatures
ever
thought
to
ask
of
thee
at
all
o
faithful
father
may
it
please
thy
infinite
compassion
to
grant
to
us
that
we
may
never
use
these
thy
gifts
and
favours
otherwise
than
as
is
agreeable
to
thy
holy
will
and
pleasure
and
as
may
tend
to
the
honour
of
thy
great
and
unspeakable
name
that
we
with
all
the
elect
may
ever
praise
honour
and
glorify
thee
here
on
earth
and
hereafter
in
heaven
for
ever
and
for
evermore
and
with
these
and
the
like
words
which
flowed
from
the
very
depth
of
my
soul
with
hearty
and
true
faith
i
went
on
till
i
had
gathered
all
the
eggs
we
needed
and
with
them
came
back
to
our
hut
even
as
our
supper
stood
excellently
well
served
upon
the
chest
we
had
that
day
fished
out
of
the
sea
with
our
and
which
my
comrade
had
made
use
of
for
a
table
now
while
i
was
absent
seeking
for
eggs
my
comrade
which
was
a
lad
of
some
twenty
odd
years
i
being
now
over
forty
had
struck
a
bargain
with
our
maid
that
should
be
both
for
his
ruin
and
mine
for
finding
themselves
alone
in
my
absence
and
talking
together
of
old
times
and
also
of
the
fruitfulness
and
great
delight
of
this
blessed
yea
more
than
fortunate
isle
they
had
grown
so
familiar
that
they
had
begun
to
speak
of
a
match
between
them
of
which
the
pretended
abyssinian
would
not
hear
unless
agreed
that
my
comrade
the
carpenter
should
make
himself
master
of
the
island
and
rid
them
of
me
for
said
she
it
were
impossible
for
them
to
dwell
in
peace
in
wedlock
so
long
as
an
unmarried
man
lived
by
them
for
bethink
thyself
says
she
how
would
not
suspicion
and
jealousy
plague
thee
if
thou
wert
my
husband
and
yet
the
old
fellow
talking
with
me
day
by
day
even
if
he
should
never
think
to
make
a
cuckold
of
thee
nay
but
i
know
a
better
plan
if
i
be
to
be
married
on
this
island
that
well
can
feed
a
thousand
or
more
persons
to
increase
the
human
race
then
let
the
old
fellow
marry
me
for
were
it
so
but
a
year
to
count
on
or
perhaps
twelve
or
at
most
fourteen
in
which
time
he
and
i
might
breed
a
daughter
and
marry
her
to
thee
who
would
not
then
be
of
the
age
that
the
old
man
is
now
and
in
the
meantime
ye
might
cherish
the
certain
hope
that
the
one
should
be
the
and
the
other
his
and
so
do
away
all
evil
suspicions
and
deliver
me
from
all
dangers
which
otherwise
i
might
encounter
with
doubtless
is
true
that
a
young
woman
like
me
would
sooner
wed
with
a
young
man
than
an
old
yet
must
we
suit
ourselves
to
the
circumstance
as
our
present
plight
doth
require
to
provide
that
i
and
she
that
may
be
born
of
me
shall
be
in
safety
by
this
discourse
which
lasted
much
longer
and
was
more
fully
set
forth
than
i
have
here
described
and
also
by
the
beauty
of
the
pretended
abyssinian
which
in
the
light
of
the
fire
did
shine
more
perfect
than
ever
in
my
comrade
eyes
and
by
her
lively
actions
my
good
carpenter
was
so
captivated
and
befooled
that
he
was
not
ashamed
to
say
he
would
sooner
throw
the
old
man
meaning
me
into
the
sea
and
send
the
whole
island
to
the
devil
than
deliver
over
to
him
so
fair
a
lady
and
thereupon
was
the
bargain
i
spoke
of
concluded
between
them
namely
that
he
should
slay
me
with
his
axe
from
behind
or
in
my
sleep
for
he
was
afeared
of
my
great
strength
of
body
as
well
as
of
my
staff
which
he
had
himself
fashioned
for
me
as
strong
as
a
beam
so
this
compact
being
made
she
shewed
my
comrade
close
to
our
dwelling
a
kind
of
fine
potter
earth
of
which
she
promised
to
make
fine
earthen
vessels
after
the
manner
of
the
indian
women
on
the
guinea
coast
and
laid
all
manner
of
plans
how
she
would
maintain
herself
and
her
family
on
this
island
rear
them
and
provide
for
them
a
peaceful
and
sufficient
livelihood
yea
even
to
the
hundredth
generation
and
could
not
boast
enough
of
what
profit
she
could
make
of
the
and
the
cotton
which
the
same
do
bear
or
produce
out
of
which
she
would
provide
herself
and
all
her
children
children
with
clothing
but
i
poor
wretch
came
knowing
no
word
of
this
foul
business
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
what
was
yet
before
me
saying
moreover
according
to
the
worshipful
christian
usage
the
benedicite
yet
no
sooner
had
i
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
the
meats
and
over
my
companions
at
table
and
asked
god
blessing
when
our
cookmaid
vanished
away
with
the
chest
and
all
that
had
been
in
it
and
left
behind
her
such
an
horrible
stench
that
my
comrade
fainted
clean
away
because
of
it
how
they
thereafter
kept
house
together
and
how
they
set
to
work
now
as
soon
as
he
was
recovered
and
come
to
his
senses
he
knelt
down
before
me
and
folded
his
hands
and
for
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
continually
said
nothing
but
oh
my
father
o
my
brother
o
my
father
o
my
brother
and
then
began
with
the
repeating
of
these
words
to
weep
so
bitterly
that
for
very
sobbing
he
could
utter
no
word
that
could
be
understood
until
i
conceived
that
by
reason
of
the
fear
and
the
stench
he
had
lost
his
reason
but
when
he
would
not
cease
this
behaviour
and
continually
besought
my
forgiveness
i
answered
him
dear
friend
what
have
i
to
forgive
thee
that
hast
never
harmed
me
in
thy
life
do
but
tell
me
how
i
can
help
thee
nay
says
he
i
seek
for
pardon
for
i
have
sinned
against
god
and
thee
and
myself
and
therewith
began
again
his
former
lamentations
and
went
on
so
long
that
at
last
i
said
i
knew
no
evil
of
him
and
if
he
had
done
any
such
that
weighed
upon
his
conscience
i
would
not
only
from
my
heart
forgive
and
condone
anything
that
concerned
myself
but
also
so
far
as
he
might
have
sinned
against
god
would
with
him
beseech
the
divine
mercy
for
pardon
at
which
words
he
embraced
my
knees
and
kissed
them
and
looked
upon
me
so
sorrowfully
that
i
was
as
one
dumb
and
could
not
conceive
or
guess
what
ailed
the
lad
but
when
i
had
taken
him
to
my
arms
and
embraced
him
begging
him
to
tell
me
what
troubled
him
and
how
i
could
help
him
he
confessed
to
me
in
every
particular
his
discourse
with
the
pretended
abyssinian
and
the
resolve
he
had
formed
in
respect
of
me
in
despite
of
god
and
of
nature
and
of
christian
love
and
of
the
laws
of
true
friendship
which
we
had
solemnly
sworn
one
to
another
and
this
he
did
with
such
words
and
behaviour
that
from
it
his
sincere
repentance
and
contrite
heart
might
easily
be
guessed
and
presumed
so
i
comforted
him
as
well
as
i
could
and
said
god
had
peradventure
sent
us
this
as
a
warning
that
we
might
in
time
to
come
be
better
aware
of
the
devil
snares
and
temptations
and
live
in
the
constant
fear
of
god
that
he
had
of
a
surety
cause
enough
to
pray
god
heartily
for
forgiveness
for
his
evil
intent
yet
even
greater
cause
to
thank
him
for
his
goodness
and
mercy
seeing
that
he
had
in
such
fatherly
wise
plucked
him
forth
from
wicked
satan
traps
and
snares
and
so
saved
him
from
destruction
now
and
eternally
and
that
we
must
perforce
here
walk
more
circumspectly
than
if
we
dwelt
in
the
midst
of
the
world
among
other
men
for
should
one
or
the
other
or
both
fall
into
temptation
there
would
be
none
at
hand
to
help
us
but
god
himself
whom
we
must
therefore
the
more
diligently
keep
before
our
eyes
and
without
ceasing
pray
for
his
help
and
assistance
by
talk
of
such
things
he
was
is
true
somewhat
cheered
yet
would
not
be
altogether
content
but
humbly
besought
me
to
lay
upon
him
a
penance
for
his
sin
so
to
raise
up
his
prostrate
spirit
as
far
as
might
be
i
said
that
he
being
a
carpenter
and
having
yet
his
axe
by
him
should
in
the
same
place
where
we
as
well
as
our
hellish
cookmaid
had
come
to
land
set
up
a
cross
on
the
shore
whereby
he
would
not
only
perform
a
penance
well
pleasing
to
god
but
also
bring
it
to
pass
that
in
time
to
come
the
evil
spirit
who
doth
ever
fear
the
sign
of
holy
cross
would
not
again
so
easily
attack
our
island
he
answered
not
only
a
cross
on
the
shore
but
two
also
on
the
mountain
will
i
make
ready
and
set
up
if
only
my
father
i
may
again
possess
thy
grace
and
favour
and
be
assured
of
god
forgiveness
in
which
fervour
he
went
away
straightway
and
ceased
not
to
toil
till
he
had
made
ready
three
crosses
whereof
we
set
up
one
on
the
and
the
other
two
apart
on
the
highest
top
of
the
hill
with
the
inscription
that
followeth
to
the
honour
of
god
almighty
and
in
despite
of
the
enemy
of
mankind
simon
meron
of
lisbon
in
portugal
with
counsel
and
help
of
his
faithful
friend
simplicius
simplicissimus
a
high
german
did
fashion
and
here
set
up
this
token
of
our
saviour
sufferings
for
jesus
christ
his
sake
thenceforward
we
began
to
live
somewhat
more
religiously
than
before
and
in
order
to
our
reverencing
and
keeping
of
the
sabbath
i
every
day
in
place
of
an
almanack
cut
a
notch
in
a
post
and
on
sundays
a
cross
and
then
would
we
sit
together
and
talk
of
holy
and
godly
things
and
this
fashion
must
i
use
because
i
had
not
yet
invented
anything
to
serve
me
in
the
stead
of
ink
and
paper
by
means
of
which
i
might
set
down
somewhat
in
writing
to
keep
count
of
our
life
and
now
to
end
this
chapter
i
must
make
mention
of
a
strange
adventure
that
did
greatly
terrify
and
distress
us
on
the
evening
after
our
cook
her
vanishing
for
the
first
night
we
perceived
it
not
because
sleep
overpowered
us
at
once
by
reason
of
fatigue
and
great
weariness
and
this
was
it
we
having
still
before
our
eyes
the
thousand
snares
by
which
the
accursed
devil
would
have
wrought
our
ruin
in
the
form
of
the
abyssinian
could
not
sleep
but
passed
the
time
in
watching
and
indeed
for
the
most
part
in
prayer
and
so
soon
as
it
became
a
little
dark
we
saw
floating
around
us
in
the
air
an
innumerable
quantity
of
lights
which
gave
forth
such
a
bright
glow
that
we
could
discern
the
fruit
on
the
trees
from
the
leaves
this
we
deemed
to
be
another
invention
of
the
enemy
to
torment
us
and
therefore
kept
still
and
quiet
but
in
the
end
found
was
but
a
kind
of
firefly
or
as
we
call
them
in
germany
which
are
generated
by
a
particular
kind
of
rotten
wood
that
is
found
in
this
island
and
shine
so
bright
that
one
can
well
use
them
in
place
of
a
lighted
candle
for
i
have
written
this
book
for
the
most
part
thus
and
if
they
were
as
common
in
europe
asia
and
africa
as
they
be
here
the
would
do
a
poor
trade
further
sequel
of
the
above
story
and
how
simon
meron
left
the
island
and
this
life
and
how
simplicissimus
remained
the
sole
lord
of
the
island
and
now
seeing
we
must
perforce
remain
where
we
were
we
began
to
order
our
housekeeping
accordingly
so
my
comrade
made
out
of
a
black
wood
that
is
almost
like
to
iron
mattocks
and
shovels
for
us
both
with
the
help
of
which
we
first
dug
holes
for
the
three
crosses
before
mentioned
and
secondly
drew
the
into
trenches
where
as
i
had
seen
at
alexandria
in
egypt
it
turned
into
salt
and
thirdly
we
began
to
make
us
a
cheerful
garden
for
we
deemed
that
idleness
would
be
for
us
the
beginning
of
destruction
fourthly
we
dug
another
channel
for
the
brook
into
which
we
could
at
pleasure
turn
it
off
and
so
leave
the
old
dry
and
take
out
as
many
fish
and
crayfish
as
we
would
with
hands
and
feet
dry
fifthly
we
found
near
the
said
brook
a
most
beautiful
potter
clay
and
though
we
had
neither
lathe
nor
wheel
and
most
of
all
no
borer
or
other
instruments
so
as
to
make
anything
of
the
kind
and
so
mould
for
ourselves
vessels
and
though
we
had
never
learned
the
craft
yet
we
devised
a
plan
by
which
we
got
what
we
wanted
for
having
kneaded
and
prepared
the
clay
as
it
should
be
we
made
rolls
of
it
of
the
thickness
and
length
of
english
and
these
we
stuck
one
upon
another
like
a
snail
shell
and
formed
out
of
such
whatever
vessels
we
would
both
great
and
small
pots
and
dishes
for
cooking
and
drinking
and
when
our
first
baking
of
these
prospered
we
had
no
longer
reason
to
complain
of
lack
of
anything
true
we
had
no
bread
but
yet
plenty
of
dried
fish
which
we
used
in
its
stead
and
in
time
our
scheme
for
getting
salt
turned
out
well
so
that
now
we
had
nothing
to
complain
of
but
lived
like
the
folk
in
the
golden
age
of
the
world
and
little
by
little
we
learned
how
with
eggs
dried
fish
and
lemon
peel
which
two
last
we
ground
to
a
soft
meal
between
two
stones
and
birds
fat
which
we
got
from
the
birds
called
boobies
and
noddies
to
bake
savoury
cakes
in
place
of
bread
likewise
did
my
comrade
devise
how
to
draw
off
the
very
cleverly
into
great
pots
and
let
it
stand
for
a
few
days
till
it
fermented
and
then
would
he
drink
of
it
till
he
reeled
and
this
at
last
he
came
to
do
every
day
and
god
knoweth
how
i
dissuaded
him
therefrom
for
he
said
if
was
allowed
to
stand
longer
turn
to
vinegar
in
which
there
was
some
truth
yet
i
answered
him
he
should
not
at
one
time
draw
so
much
but
only
enough
for
our
needs
to
which
he
replied
that
was
a
sin
to
despise
the
gifts
of
god
and
that
the
must
have
a
vein
opened
at
proper
times
lest
they
should
be
choked
with
their
own
blood
and
so
must
i
give
a
loose
rein
to
his
appetites
unless
i
would
be
told
that
i
grudged
him
that
of
which
we
had
plenty
and
so
as
i
have
said
we
lived
like
the
first
men
in
the
golden
age
when
a
bountiful
heaven
produced
for
them
all
good
things
from
the
earth
without
labour
on
their
part
but
even
as
in
this
world
there
is
no
life
so
sweet
and
happy
that
is
not
at
times
made
bitter
by
the
gall
of
suffering
so
happened
it
with
us
for
the
richer
we
grew
daily
in
larder
and
cellar
the
more
threadbare
did
our
clothes
from
day
to
day
become
till
at
last
they
rotted
on
our
bodies
and
was
well
for
us
indeed
that
we
thus
far
had
had
no
winter
no
not
the
slightest
cold
although
by
this
time
when
we
began
to
go
naked
we
had
by
my
spent
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
on
the
island
but
all
the
year
round
was
such
weather
as
is
wont
to
be
in
europe
in
may
and
june
save
that
about
august
and
a
little
before
it
used
to
rain
mighty
hard
and
there
were
great
thunderstorms
moreover
from
one
solstice
to
another
the
days
did
not
vary
in
length
more
than
an
hour
and
a
quarter
but
although
we
were
alone
upon
the
island
yet
would
we
not
go
naked
like
brute
beasts
but
clothed
as
became
honest
christians
of
europe
and
had
we
but
had
beasts
it
had
been
easy
to
help
ourselves
by
using
their
hides
for
clothing
for
lack
of
which
we
skinned
the
birds
we
took
such
as
boobies
and
penguins
and
made
clothes
of
this
yet
because
for
want
of
the
needful
tools
and
other
material
for
the
purpose
we
could
not
dress
them
so
as
to
last
they
became
stiff
and
uneasy
and
fell
away
in
pieces
from
our
bodies
before
we
were
ware
of
it
is
true
the
bore
cotton
enough
for
us
yet
could
we
neither
weave
nor
spin
but
my
comrade
that
had
been
some
years
in
india
shewed
me
on
the
leaves
at
the
very
tip
a
thing
like
a
sharp
thorn
which
if
it
be
broken
off
and
drawn
along
the
stem
of
the
leaf
as
we
do
with
the
called
faseoli
to
strip
them
of
their
rind
there
will
remain
hanging
on
the
said
pointed
thorn
a
string
as
long
as
the
stem
or
the
leaf
is
so
that
one
can
use
the
same
for
needle
and
thread
too
and
this
provided
me
with
opportunity
to
make
for
us
breeches
of
those
leaves
and
sew
them
together
with
the
threads
of
their
own
growing
but
while
we
thus
lived
together
and
had
so
improved
our
condition
that
we
had
no
longer
any
cause
to
trouble
for
overwork
waste
want
or
calamity
my
comrade
went
on
daily
tippling
at
his
as
he
had
begun
and
now
had
made
a
habit
of
it
till
at
last
he
so
inflamed
his
lungs
and
liver
that
before
i
was
rightly
ware
of
it
he
by
his
untimely
death
left
me
and
the
island
and
and
all
him
did
i
bury
as
well
as
i
was
able
and
as
i
pondered
upon
the
uncertainty
of
human
life
and
other
the
like
matters
i
wrote
for
him
this
epitaph
that
followeth
that
i
am
buried
here
and
not
in
ocean
deep
nor
in
the
flames
of
hell
from
which
may
god
us
keep
the
cause
was
this
three
things
did
for
my
soul
contend
the
first
the
raging
sea
the
next
the
infernal
fiend
these
two
did
i
escape
by
god
his
help
and
grace
the
third
was
wine
of
palms
which
brought
me
to
this
place
so
i
became
lord
of
the
whole
island
and
began
again
a
hermit
life
for
which
i
had
now
not
only
opportunity
more
than
enough
but
also
a
fixed
desire
and
purpose
thereto
is
true
i
made
all
use
of
the
good
things
and
gifts
of
this
place
with
hearty
thanks
to
god
whose
goodness
and
might
alone
had
so
richly
provided
for
me
but
withal
i
was
careful
not
to
misuse
this
superfluity
and
often
did
i
wish
that
i
had
christian
men
with
me
that
elsewhere
must
suffer
poverty
and
need
to
profit
with
me
by
the
gifts
that
god
had
given
but
because
i
knew
that
for
his
almighty
power
was
more
than
possible
if
it
were
but
his
divine
will
to
bring
thither
more
folk
in
easier
and
more
miraculous
fashion
than
i
had
been
brought
it
often
gave
me
cause
humbly
to
thank
him
for
his
divine
providence
in
that
he
had
in
such
fatherly
wise
cared
for
me
more
than
many
thousands
of
other
men
and
set
me
in
a
place
so
full
of
content
and
peace
in
which
the
hermit
concludes
his
story
and
therewith
ends
these
his
six
books
now
had
my
comrade
hardly
been
a
week
dead
when
i
marked
that
my
abode
was
haunted
yea
yea
i
thought
simplicissimus
thou
art
now
alone
and
so
was
to
be
expected
that
the
evil
one
should
endeavour
to
torment
thee
didst
not
look
that
that
malicious
spirit
would
make
thy
life
hard
for
thee
yet
why
take
count
of
him
when
thou
hast
god
to
thy
friend
thou
needest
but
somewhat
wherein
to
exercise
thyself
else
wilt
thou
come
to
thy
ruin
from
mere
idleness
and
superfluity
for
besides
him
thou
hast
no
enemy
but
thine
own
self
and
the
plenty
and
pleasaunce
of
this
island
therefore
make
thy
resolve
to
strive
against
him
who
in
his
own
conceit
is
the
strongest
of
all
for
be
he
overcome
by
god
his
help
then
shouldst
thou
if
god
will
by
his
grace
remain
master
of
thyself
and
with
these
thoughts
i
went
my
way
for
a
day
or
two
and
they
made
of
me
a
better
and
a
piouser
man
for
i
did
prepare
myself
for
that
encounter
which
without
doubt
i
must
endure
with
the
evil
spirit
yet
herein
did
i
for
this
time
deceive
myself
for
as
on
a
certain
evening
i
perceived
a
somewhat
that
could
be
heard
i
went
out
of
my
hut
which
stood
close
beneath
a
spur
of
that
mountain
beneath
which
was
the
spring
of
that
sweet
water
that
floweth
through
the
island
into
the
sea
and
there
saw
i
my
comrade
that
scrabbled
with
his
fingers
in
a
cleft
of
the
rock
then
may
ye
easily
understand
that
i
was
afeared
yet
quickly
i
plucked
up
heart
and
commended
myself
to
god
protection
with
the
sign
of
holy
cross
and
thought
this
thing
must
be
better
than
with
that
i
went
up
to
the
spirit
and
used
to
him
such
words
as
be
customary
in
such
a
case
and
then
forthwith
i
understood
that
was
my
deceased
comrade
which
in
his
lifetime
had
there
concealed
his
ducats
as
thinking
that
if
sooner
or
later
a
ship
should
come
to
the
island
he
would
recover
them
and
take
them
away
with
him
yea
and
he
gave
me
to
know
that
he
had
trusted
more
in
this
handful
of
money
whereby
he
hoped
again
to
come
to
his
home
than
on
god
for
which
cause
he
must
now
do
penance
by
such
unrest
after
his
death
and
moreover
against
his
will
be
a
cause
of
uneasiness
to
myself
so
at
his
desire
i
took
forth
the
money
yet
held
it
as
less
than
naught
as
will
the
sooner
be
believed
because
i
had
nothing
on
which
to
employ
it
and
this
was
now
the
first
affright
that
i
had
after
i
was
left
alone
yet
afterwards
was
plagued
by
spirits
of
other
sorts
than
this
one
whereof
i
will
say
no
more
but
this
only
that
by
god
help
and
grace
i
attained
to
this
that
i
found
no
single
enemy
more
save
only
mine
own
thoughts
which
were
oft
troubled
enough
for
these
go
not
before
god
as
men
do
vainly
talk
but
in
his
good
time
a
reckoning
must
be
paid
for
these
also
so
that
these
might
the
less
stain
my
soul
with
sins
i
busied
myself
not
only
in
the
avoiding
of
that
which
profited
naught
but
did
impose
on
myself
a
bodily
task
the
which
to
perform
with
my
customary
prayer
for
as
man
is
born
for
work
like
the
bird
for
flying
so
on
the
other
hand
doth
idleness
inflict
her
sicknesses
both
on
soul
and
body
and
in
the
end
when
we
be
least
ware
of
it
eternal
ruin
for
this
cause
i
planted
me
a
garden
of
which
indeed
i
had
less
need
than
the
waggon
hath
of
a
fifth
wheel
seeing
that
the
whole
island
might
well
be
called
one
lovely
so
was
my
work
of
no
other
avail
but
that
i
brought
this
and
that
into
completer
order
albeit
to
many
the
natural
disorder
of
the
plants
as
they
grew
mingled
together
might
appear
more
pleasing
and
again
that
as
aforesaid
i
shunned
idleness
o
how
oft
did
i
wish
when
i
had
wearied
out
my
body
and
must
give
it
rest
that
i
had
godly
books
wherein
to
comfort
to
delight
and
to
edify
myself
but
such
i
could
not
come
by
yet
as
i
had
once
read
of
a
holy
man
that
he
said
the
whole
wide
world
was
to
him
one
great
book
wherein
to
recognise
the
wondrous
works
of
god
and
to
be
cheered
to
praise
him
so
i
thought
to
follow
him
therein
howbeit
i
was
so
to
speak
no
longer
in
the
world
for
that
little
island
must
be
my
whole
world
and
in
the
same
every
thing
yea
every
tree
an
incitement
to
godliness
and
a
reminder
of
such
thoughts
as
a
good
christian
should
have
thus
did
i
see
a
prickly
plant
forthwith
i
thought
on
christ
his
crown
of
thorns
saw
i
an
apple
or
a
pomegranate
then
i
reflected
on
the
fall
of
our
first
parents
and
mourned
therefore
when
i
did
draw
from
a
tree
i
fancied
to
myself
how
mercifully
my
redeemer
had
shed
his
blood
for
me
on
the
tree
of
the
holy
cross
when
i
looked
on
sea
or
on
mountain
then
i
remembered
this
or
that
miracle
which
our
saviour
had
wrought
in
such
places
and
when
i
found
one
or
more
stones
that
were
convenient
for
casting
i
had
before
mine
eyes
the
picture
of
the
jews
that
would
have
stoned
christ
and
when
i
walked
in
my
garden
i
thought
on
the
prayer
of
agony
in
mount
olivet
or
on
the
grave
of
christ
and
how
after
his
resurrection
he
appeared
to
mary
magdalene
in
the
garden
such
thoughts
were
my
daily
occupation
never
did
i
eat
but
that
i
thought
on
the
last
supper
and
never
cooked
my
food
without
the
fire
reminding
me
of
the
eternal
pains
of
hell
at
last
i
found
that
with
of
which
there
be
several
sorts
on
this
island
when
mixed
with
was
easy
to
write
on
a
kind
of
large
which
rejoiced
me
greatly
for
now
could
i
devise
and
write
out
prayers
in
order
yea
in
the
end
considering
with
hearty
repentance
my
whole
life
and
my
knavish
tricks
that
i
had
committed
from
my
youth
up
and
how
the
merciful
god
despite
all
such
gross
sins
had
not
only
thus
far
preserved
me
from
everlasting
damnation
but
had
given
me
time
and
opportunity
to
better
myself
and
to
be
converted
to
beg
his
forgiveness
and
to
thank
him
for
his
mercies
i
did
write
down
all
that
had
befallen
me
in
this
book
made
of
the
and
laid
them
together
with
my
comrade
ducats
in
this
place
to
the
end
that
if
at
any
time
folk
should
come
hither
they
might
find
such
and
therefrom
learn
who
it
was
that
before
inhabited
this
island
and
whoso
shall
find
this
and
read
it
be
it
or
either
before
or
after
my
death
him
i
beg
that
if
he
meet
therein
with
words
which
be
not
becoming
for
one
that
would
do
better
to
speak
much
less
to
write
he
will
not
be
angered
thereat
but
will
consider
that
the
telling
of
light
actions
and
stories
demands
words
fitting
thereto
and
even
as
the
houseleek
can
not
easily
be
soaked
by
any
rain
that
so
a
true
and
devout
spirit
can
not
forthwith
be
infected
poisoned
and
corrupted
by
any
discourse
though
it
seem
as
wanton
as
you
will
the
honourably
minded
christian
reader
will
rather
wonder
and
praise
the
divine
mercy
when
he
shall
find
that
so
knavish
a
companion
as
i
have
been
yet
hath
had
such
grace
of
god
as
to
resign
the
world
and
to
live
in
such
a
condition
that
therein
he
hopeth
to
come
to
eternal
glory
and
to
attain
to
everlasting
blessedness
by
the
sufferings
of
his
redeemer
through
a
pious

concerning
simplicissimus

by
stress
of
weather
from
the
fleet
with
which
he
had
sailed
having
many
of
his
crew
sick
and
no
fresh
water
he
is
delighted
to
discover
simplicissimus
isle
his
men
go
ashore
and
find
the
dwelling
which
as
the
captain
only
afterwards
learn
they
plunder
and
generally
behave
brutally
cornelissen
finds
the
crosses
and
many
pious
inscriptions
on
trees
which
prove
to
him
that
the
unknown
is
a
good
christian
though
probably
a
papist
the
crew
track
simplicissimus
to
a
vast
cavern
on
entering
which
their
lights
are
miraculously
extinguished
there
is
an
earthquake
and
the
seamen
who
had
taken
part
in
the
plundering
of
the
hermit
dwelling
are
smitten
with
madness
cornelissen
with
the
chaplain
and
officers
determines
to
find
simplicissimus
at
any
cost
they
penetrate
the
cave
but
their
lights
also
go
out
and
simplicissimus
addresses
them
from
the
darkness
and
remonstrates
with
them
for
their
interference
the
chaplain
apologises
and
asks
how
the
madmen
may
be
cured
he
is
told
that
they
are
to
swallow
the
kernels
of
certain
plums
they
had
eaten
they
offer
to
take
him
back
to
europe
but
he
refuses
after
making
a
bargain
with
them
to
secure
his
being
left
in
peace
simplicissimus
shews
himself
surrounded
with
his
he
leads
them
out
of
the
cave
and
shews
them
his
ruined
hut
and
tells
how
his
ducats
and
his
book
had
been
stolen
the
madmen
are
brought
to
their
senses
again
simplicissimus
recovers
his
book
which
he
entrusts
to
cornelissen
but
again
refuses
to
return
to
sinful
europe
they
rebuild
his
hut
for
him
provide
him
with
plenty
of
tools
a
cotton
clothing
and
a
pair
of
rabbits
for
breeding
purposes
and
so
their
sick
being
all
recovered
sail
away
and
leave
him
there
a
reference
to
the
introduction
will
show
that
this
island
adventure
could
have
had
no
place
in
the
simplician
cycle
of
romances
unless
we
suppose
which
is
highly
improbable
that
the
author
meant
it
to
be
subsequent
to
the
inn
episode
in
which
simplicissimus
family
and
friends
all
meet

likely
we
have
here
the
latest
addition
in
point
of
composition
to
the
legend
the
following
is
given
as
a
specimen
of
the
nonsense
of
which
the
various
continuations
are
made
up
appendix
c
continuatio
how
simplicissimus
in
return
for
a
night
lodging
taught
his
host
a
curious
art
now
the
evening
before
this
i
had
lost
a
certain
catalogue
of
those
special
arts
which
i
had
aforetime
practised
and
written
down
that
i
might
not
forget
them
so
easily
yet
i
depended
not
on
this
to
remember
how
to
perform
them
and
with
what
helps
for
example
i
do
here
set
down
the
beginning
of
this
list
so
to
prepare
matches
or
fuses
that
they
shall
give
out
no
smell
seeing
that
by
such
smell
musqueteers
be
often
betrayed
and
their
plans
defeated
to
prepare
match
so
that
it
will
burn
though
it
be
wet
to
prepare
powder
so
that
it
will
not
burn
though
steel
be
thrust

that

in

bk

in
like
manner
were
many
arts
described
in
the
said
catalogue
which
mine
host
had
found
and
read
so
he
came
to
me
himself
into
my
chamber
shewed
me
the
list
and
asked
whether
was
possible
that
these
things
could
be
done
by
natural
means
for
that
could
he
scarce
believe
yet
must
confess
that
in
his
youth
when
he
served
as
a
page
in
italy
with
von
schauenburg
it
was
given
out
by
some
that
the
princes
of
savoy
were
proof
against
bullets
which
the
said
desired
to
make
proof
of
in
the
person
of
prince
thomas
whom
he
then
kept
besieged
in
a
fortress
for
when
on
a
time
both
sides
had
agreed
on
a
truce
for
an
hour
to
bury
the
dead
and
to
confer
together
he
had
commanded
a
corporal
of
his
regiment
that
was
held
to
be
the
best
marksman
in
the
whole
army
to
take
aim
at
the
said
prince
while
he
should
be
standing
on
the
parapet
of
the
wall
for
a
parley
and
so
soon
as
the
hour
agreed
upon
should
end
to
fire
at
him
with
his
piece
with
which
he
could
put
a
lighted
candle
out
at
fifty
paces
that
this
corporal
had
taken
careful
note
of
the
time
and
kept
the
said
prince
under
observation
the
whole
time
of
the
truce
and
at
the
very
moment
when
it
ended
with
the
first
stroke
of
the
hour
fired
at
him
yet
had
his
piece
contrary
to
all
belief
missed
fire
and
before
the
corporal
could
make
ready
again
the
prince
was
gone
behind
the
parapet
whereupon
the
corporal
pointed
out
to
the
who
had
likewise
come
to
him
on
the
trenches
a
switzer
of
the
prince
guard
at
whom
he
aimed
and
hit
him
in
such
fashion
that
he
rolled
over
and
over
wherefrom
it
plainly
appeared
that
there
was
something
in
the
story
that
no
prince
of
the
house
of
savoy
could
be
hit
or
harmed
yet
whether
this
was
brought
about
by
such
arts
or
whether
perchance
the
said
princely
house
enjoyed
a
special
grace
from
god
being
as
was
said
sprung
from
the
race
of
the
royal
prophet
david
he
knew
not
i
answered
i
know
not
either
but
this
i
do
know
of
a
surety
that
the
arts
here
specified
be
natural
and
no
witchcraft
which
if
he
would
not
believe
let
him
but
say
which
he
held
to
be
the
most
wonderful
and
impossible
and
i
would
at
once
to
satisfy
him
provided
only
that
was
one
that
asked
not
long
time
but
only
such
means
as
i
had
then
at
hand
make
trial
of
it
for
i
must
presently
be
and
pursue
my
journey
at
that
he
said
this
seemed
to
him
the
most
impossible
that
gunpowder
should
not
burn
if
fire
were
put
to
it
unless
one
should
first
pour
the
powder
into
water
which
if
i
could
by
natural
means
effect
he
would
believe
concerning
all
the
other
arts
though
there
were
over
sixty
of
them
what
he
might
not
see
and
before
such
trial
could
not
believe
i
answered
let
him
bring
me
quickly
a
charge
of
powder
and
also
a
certain
substance
which
i
had
need
of
and
fire
also
and
presently
he
should
see
that
the
trick
would
hold
this
being
done
i
caused
him
to
follow
my
process
and
then
set
light
to
the
powder
yet
could
he
do
no
more
than
burn
here
and
there
a
grain
though
he
worked
at
it
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
accomplished
no
more
than
that
he
cooled
a
iron
and
quenched
matches
and
lighted
coals
in
the
very
powder
itself
aha
says
he
the
powder
is
bad
but
i
answered
him
in
act
and
without
much
ado
before
he
could
count
a
score
so
worked
it
that
the
powder
blew
up
when
he
had
scarce
touched
it
with
the
fire
