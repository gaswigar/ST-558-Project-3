home
she
did
not
look
very
much
as
if
she
were
asleep
nor
acted
as
though
she
expected
to
get
a
chance
to
be
very
soon
there
was
no
end
to
the
things
which
she
had
to
do
for
the
kitchen
was
long
and
wide
and
took
many
steps
to
set
it
in
order
and
it
was
drawing
toward
of
a
tuesday
evening
and
there
were
fifteen
boarders
who
were
most
of
them
punctual
to
a
minute
sadie
the
next
oldest
sister
was
still
at
the
academy
as
also
were
alfred
and
julia
while
little
minnie
the
pet
and
darling
most
certainly
was
she
was
around
in
the
way
putting
little
fingers
into
every
possible
place
where
little
fingers
ought
not
to
be
it
was
well
for
her
that
no
matter
how
warm
and
vexed
and
out
of
order
ester
might
be
she
never
reached
the
point
in
which
her
voice
could
take
other
than
a
loving
tone
in
speaking
to
minnie
for
minnie
besides
being
a
precious
little
blessing
in
herself
was
the
child
of
ester
oldest
sister
whose
home
was
far
away
in
a
western
graveyard
and
the
little
girl
had
been
with
them
since
her
early
babyhood
three
years
before
so
ester
hurried
to
and
from
the
pantry
with
quick
nervous
movements
as
the
sun
went
toward
the
west
saying
to
maggie
who
was
ironing
with
all
possible
speed
maggie
do
and
get
ready
to
help
me
or
i
shall
never
have
tea
ready
saying
it
in
a
sharp
fretful
tone
then
no
no
birdie
do
touch
in
quite
a
different
tone
to
minnie
who
laid
loving
hands
on
a
box
of
raisins
i
hurrying
as
fast
as
i
maggie
made
answer
but
such
an
ironing
as
i
have
every
week
ca
be
finished
in
a
minute
well
well
do
talk
that
wo
hurry
matters
any
sadie
ried
opened
the
door
that
led
from
the
to
the
kitchen
and
peeped
in
a
thoughtless
young
head
covered
with
bright
brown
curls
how
are
you
ester
and
she
emerged
fully
into
the
great
warm
kitchen
looking
like
a
bright
flower
picked
from
the
garden
and
put
out
of
place
her
pink
gingham
dress
and
white
ruffled
apron
yes
and
the
very
school
books
which
she
swung
by
their
strap
waking
a
smothered
sigh
in
ester
heart
o
my
patience
was
her
greeting

sober

a
minute

only
i
brought
florence
vane
home
with
me
and
i
should
not

in
the
meantime

tone

little
girl

a
story
and
minnie
ester
darling
who
never
received
other
than
loving
words
from
her
went
gleefully
off
leaving
another
heartburn
to
the
weary
girl
they
her
those
words
auntie
essie
cross
is
she
back
and
forth
from
to
pantry
from
pantry
to
went
the
quick
feet
at
last
she
spoke
maggie

the
ironing
and
help
me
it
is
time
tea

ready
i
just
ironing
holland
shirt
objected
maggie
well
i
do
care
if
holland
has
another
shirt
ironed
i
want
you
to
go
to
the
spring
for
water
and
fill
the
and
do
a
dozen
other
things
the
tall
clock
in
the
struck
five
and
the
pealed
out
its
prompt
summons
through
the
house
the
family
gathered
promptly
and
noisily
half
a
dozen
or
more
hammond
the
principal
of
the
academy
miss
molten
the
preceptress
brookley
the
van
anden
the
new
physician
and
holland
and
arnett
holland
clerk
there
was
a
moment
hush
while
hammond
asked
a
blessing
on
the
food
then
the
merry
talk
went
on
for
them
all
maggie
poured
cups
of
tea
and
ester
passed
bread
and
butter
and
beef
and
cheese
and
sadie
gave
overflowing
dishes
of
blackberries
and
chattered
like
a
magpie
which
last
she
did
everywhere
and
always
this
has
been
one
of
the
scorching
days
holland
said
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
keep
cool
in
the
store
and
we
generally
are
well
off
for
a
breeze
there
it
has
been
more
than
could
do
to
keep
cool
anywhere
holland
answered
i
gave
it
up
long
ago
in
despair
ester
lip
curled
a
little
holland
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
from
morning
until
night
but
to
keep
herself
cool
she
wondered
what
the
lady
would
have
said
to
the
glowing
kitchen
where
had
passed
most
of
the
day
miss
ester
looks
as
though
the
heat
had
been
too
much
for
her
cheeks
brookley
said
laughing
what
you
been
doing
something
besides
keeping
cool
ester
answered
soberly
which
is
a
difficult
thing
to
do
however
van
anden
said
speaking
soberly
too
i
do
know
sir
if
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
that
i
think
i
could
manage
it
i
have
found
trouble
sometimes
in
keeping
myself
at
the
right
temperature
even
in
january
ester
cheeks
glowed
yet
more
she
understood
van
anden
and
she
knew
her
face
did
not
look
very
no
one
knows
what
prompted
minnie
to
speak
just
then
aunt
sadie
said
auntie
essie
was
cross
were
you
auntie
essie
the
household
laughed
and
sadie
came
to
the
rescue
why
minnie
you
must
not
tell
what
aunt
sadie
says
it
is
just
as
sure
to
be
nonsense
as
it
is
that
you
are
a
ester
thought
that
they
would
all
finish
their
supper
and
depart
but
the
latest
comer
strolled
away
at
last
and
she
hurried
to
toast
a
slice
of
bread
make
a
fresh
cup
of
tea
and
send
julia
after
ried
sadie
hovered
around
the
pale
woman
while
she
ate
are
you
better
mother
i
been
worried
half
to
pieces
about
you
all
day
o
yes
i
better
ester
you
look
dreadfully
tired
have
you
much
more
to
do
only
to
trim
the
lamps
and
make
three
beds
that
i
had
not
time
for
this
morning
and
get
things
ready
for
breakfast
and
finish
dress
ca
maggie
do
any
of
these
things
maggie
is
ironing
ried
sighed
it
is
a
good
thing
that
i
do
have
the
sick
headache
very
often
she
said
sadly
or
you
would
soon
wear
yourself
out
sadie
are
you
going
to
the
lyceum
tonight
yes
your
worthy
daughter
has
the
honor
of
being
editress
you
know
ester
ca
you
go
down
never
mind
that
dress
let
it
go
to
guinea
you
would
think
so
by
evening
ester
said
shortly
no
i
ca
go
the
work
was
all
done
at
last
and
ester
betook
herself
to
her
room
how
tired
she
was
every
nerve
seemed
to
quiver
with
weariness
it
was
a
pleasant
little
room
this
one
which
she
entered
with
its
low
windows
looking
out
toward
the
river
and
its
cosy
furniture
all
neatly
arranged
by
sadie
tasteful
fingers
ester
seated
herself
by
the
open
window
and
looked
down
on
the
group
who
lingered
on
the
piazza
below
looked
on
them
with
her
eyes
and
with
her
heart
yet
envied
while
she
looked
envied
their
free
and
easy
life
without
a
care
to
harass
them
so
thought
envied
sadie
her
daily
attendance
at
the
academy
a
matter
which
she
early
in
life
had
been
obliged
to
have
done
with
envied
holland
the
very
ribbons
and
laces
which
fluttered
in
the
evening
air
it
had
grown
cooler
now
a
strong
breeze
blew
up
from
the
river
and
freshened
the
air
and
as
they
sat
below
there
enjoying
it
the
sound
of
their
gay
voices
came
up
to
her
what
do
they
know
about
heat
or
care
or
trouble
she
said
scornfully
thinking
over
all
the
weight
of
eighteen
years
of
life
she
hated
it
this
life
of
hers
hated
it
the
sweeping
dusting
making
beds
trimming
lamps
from
morning
till
night
no
time
for
reading
or
study
or
pleasure
sadie
had
said
she
was
cross
and
sadie
had
told
the
truth
she
cross
most
of
the
time
fretted
with
her
petty
cares
and
fatigues
o
she
said
over
and
over
if
something
would
happen
if
i
could
have
one
day
just
day
different
from
the
others
but
no
it
the
same
old
thing
sweep
and
dust
and
clear
up
and
eat
and
sleep
i
it
all
yet
had
ester
nothing
for
which
to
be
thankful
that
the
group
on
the
piazza
had
not
if
she
had
but
thought
she
had
a
robe
and
a
crown
and
a
harp
and
a
place
waiting
for
her
up
before
the
throne
of
god
and
all
they
had
ester
did
not
think
of
this
so
much
asleep
was
she
that
she
did
not
even
know
that
none
of
those
gay
hearts
down
there
below
her
had
been
given
up
to
christ
not
one
of
them
for
the
academy
teachers
and
van
anden
were
not
among
them
o
ester
was
asleep
she
went
to
church
on
the
sabbath
and
to
preparatory
lecture
on
a
week
day
she
read
a
few
verses
in
her
bible
not
every
day
she
knelt
at
her
bedside
every
night
and
said
a
few
words
of
prayer
and
this
was
all
she
lay
at
night
side
by
side
with
a
young
sister
who
had
no
claim
to
a
home
in
heaven
and
never
spoke
to
her
of
jesus
she
worked
daily
side
by
side
with
a
mother
who
through
many
trials
and
discouragements
was
living
a
christian
life
and
never
talked
with
her
of
their
future
rest
she
met
daily
sometimes
almost
hourly
a
large
household
and
never
so
much
as
thought
of
asking
them
if
they
too
were
going
some
day
home
to
god
she
helped
her
young
brother
and
sister
with
their
geography
lessons
and
never
mentioned
to
them
the
heavenly
country
whither
they
themselves
might
journey
she
took
the
darling
of
the
family
often
in
her
arms
and
told
her
stories
of
bo
peep
and
the
babes
in
the
wood
and
robin
redbreast
and
never
one
of
jesus
and
his
call
for
the
tender
lambs
this
was
ester
and
this
was
ester
home
chapter
ii
what
sadie
thought
sadie
ried
was
the
merriest
most
thoughtless
young
creature
of
sixteen
years
that
ever
brightened
and
bothered
a
home
merry
from
morning
until
night
with
scarcely
ever
a
pause
in
her
constant
flow
of
fun
thoughtless
nearly
always
selfish
too
as
the
constantly
thoughtless
always
are
not
sullenly
and
crossly
selfish
by
any
means
only
so
used
to
think
of
self
so
taught
to
consider
herself
utterly
useless
as
regarded
home
and
home
cares
and
duties
that
she
opened
her
bright
brown
eyes
in
wonder
whenever
she
was
called
upon
for
help
it
was
a
very
bright
and
very
busy
saturday
morning
sadie
ried
called
ca

come
and
wash
up
these
baking
dishes

mopping
and

has
her
hands

said
sadie
appearing
promptly
from
the
with
minnie
perched
triumphantly
on
her
shoulder
here
i
am
at
your
service
where

they
ester
glanced
up
i
go
and
put

my
white
dress

i
were

she
said
significantly
and
sadie
looked
down
on
her
pink
gingham
ruffled
apron
shining
cuffs
and
laughed
o
i
take
off
my
cuffs
and
put
on
this
distressingly
big
apron
of
yours
which
hangs
behind
the
door
then
i
do
that
my
clean
apron
i
do
wash
dishes
in
it
o
bless
your
careful
heart

wo
hurt
it
the
least
speck
in
the
world

i
birdie
and
she
proceeded
to
wrap
her
tiny
self
in
the
long
wide
apron
not
pan
child
exclaimed
her
mother
that
a
o
said
sadie
i
thought
it
was
pretty
shiny
my
what
a
great
pan
do
you
come
near
me
birdie
or
you
tumble
in
and
drown
yourself
before
i
could
fish
you
out
with
the
where

that
article
ester
it
needs
a
patch
on
it
there
a
great
hole
in
the
middle
and
it
twists
every
way
patch
it
then
said
ester
dryly
well
now
i
ready
here
goes
do
you
want
washed
and
she
seized
upon
a
stack
of
tins
which
stood
on
ester
table
let
things
alone
said
ester
those
are
my
ready
for
use
now

them
wet
and
i
shall

to
go
all
over
them

they

pretty
greasy
slip
i
wish
you
would
go
up
stairs
i
rather

dishes
all
the
forenoon
than

you
in
the
way
birdie
said
sadie
gravely
you
and
i
mus
go
near
auntie
essie
again
she
a
and
i
afraid
she
bite
ried
laughed
she
had
no
idea
how
sharply
ester
had
been
tried
with
petty
vexations
all
that
morning
nor
how
bitter
those
words
sounded
to
her
come
sadie
she
said
what
a
silly
child
you
are
ca
you
do
soberly
i
should
think
i
might
when
i
have
such
a
sober
and
solemn
employment
on
hand
as
does
it
require
a
great
deal
of
gravity
mother
here
robin
redbreast
keep
your
beak
out
of
my
minnie
in
the
mean
time
had
been
seated
on
the
table
directly
in
front
of
the
ried
looked
around
o
sadie
what
you
to
put
her
up
there
to
keep
her
out
of
mischief
mother
she
jack
horner
little
sister
and
would
have
had
every
plum
in
your
pie
down
her
throat
by
this
time
if
she
could
have
got
to
them
see
here
pussy
if
you
do
keep
your
feet
still
i
tie
them
fast
to
the
pan
with
this
long
towel
when
you
have
to
go
around
all
the
days
of
your
life
with
a
clattering
after
you
but
minnie
was
bent
on
a
frolic
this
time
the
tiny
feet
kicked
a
little
too
hard
and
the
pan
being
drawn
too
near
the
edge
in
order
to
be
out
of
her
reach
lost
its
balance
over
it
went
o
my
patience
screamed
sadie
as
the
water
splashed
over
her
even
down
to
the
white
stockings
and
daintily
slippered
feet
minnie
lifted
up
her
voice
and
added
to
the
general
uproar
ester
left
the
eggs
she
was
beating
and
picked
up
broken
dishes
ried
voice
arose
above
the
din
sadie
take
minnie
and
go
up
stairs
you
too
full
of
play
to
be
in
the
kitchen
mother
i
sorry
said
sadie
shaking
herself
out
of
the
great
wet
apron
laughing
even
then
at
the
plight
she
was
in
pet
do
cry
we
did
drown
after
all
miss
sadie
hammond
said
as
he
met
them
in
the
hall
what
have
you
been
up
to
now
why
hammond
there
been
another
deluge
this
time
of
and
birdie
and
i
are
escaping
for
our
lives
if
there
is
one
class
of
people
in
this
world
more
disagreeable
than
all
the
rest
it
is
people
who
call
themselves
christians
this
remark
harry
arnett
made
that
same
saturday
evening
as
he
stood
on
the
piazza
waiting
for
holland
letters
and
he
made
it
to
sadie
ried
why
harry
she
answered
in
a
shocked
tone
it
a
sadie
you
just
think
a
bit
and
you
see
it
is
they
no
better
nor
pleasanter
than
other
people
and
all
the
while
they
think
they
about
right
what
has
put
you
into
that
state
of
mind
harry
o
some
things
which
happened
at
the
store
suggested
this
matter
to
me
never
mind
that
part
is
it
so
there
my
mother
sadie
said
thoughtfully
she
is
good
not
because
she
a
christian
though
it
because
she
your
mother
you
have
to
look
till
you
were
gray
to
find
a
better
mother
than
i
got
and
she
is
a
christian
either
well
i
sure
hammond
is
a
good
man
not
a
whit
better
or
pleasanter
than
holland
as
far
as
i
can
see
do
like
him
half
so
well
and
holland
do
pretend
to
be
any
better
than
the
rest
of
us
well
said
sadie
gleefully
dont
know
many
good
people
miss
molton
is
a
christian
but
i
guess
she
is
no
better
than
brookley
and
is
there
ester
she
a
member
of
the
church
and
do
you
see
as
she
gets
on
any
better
with
her
religion
than
you
do
without
it
for
part
i
think
you
are
considerably
pleasanter
to
deal
with
sadie
laughed
we
no
more
alike
than
a
bee
and
a
butterfly
or
any
other
useless
little
thing
she
said
brightly
but
you
very
much
mistaken
if
you
think
i
the
best
mother
would
lie
down
in
despair
and
die
and
this
house
would
come
to
naught
at
once
if
it
were
not
for
ester
arnett
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
liked
butterflies
better
than
bees
he
said
bees
harry
said
sadie
speaking
more
gravely
i
afraid
you
almost
an
infidel
if
i
not
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
it
not
the
fault
of
christians
holland
tossed
her
letters
down
to
him
from
the
piazza
above
and
arnett
went
away
florence
vane
came
over
from
the
cottage
across
the
way
came
with
slow
feeble
steps
and
sat
down
in
the
door
beside
her
friend
presently
ester
came
out
to
them
sadie
ca
you
go
to
the
office
for
me
i
forgot
to
send
this
letter
with
the
rest
yes
said
sadie
that
is
if
you
think
you
can
go
that
little
bit
florence
i
shall
think
for
her
van
anden
said
coming
down
the
stairs
florence
out
here
with
the
dew
falling
and
not
even
any
thing
to
protect
your
head
i
am
surprised
oh
doctor
do
let
me
enjoy
this
soft
air
for
a
few
minutes
no
either
come
in
the
house
or
go
home
you
are
very
imprudent
miss
ester
mail
your
letters
for
you
what
does
van
anden
want
to
act
like
a
simpleton
about
florence
vane
for
ester
asked
this
question
late
in
the
evening
when
the
sisters
were
alone
in
their
room
sadie
paused
in
her
merry
chatter
why
ester
what
do
you
mean
about
her
being
out
why
you
know
she
ought
to
be
very
careful
and
i
afraid
she
is
the
doctor
told
her
father
this
morning
he
was
afraid
she
would
not
live
through
the
season
unless
she
was
more
careful
fudge
said
ester
he
thinks
he
is
a
wise
man
he
wants
to
make
her
out
very
sick
so
that
he
may
have
the
honor
of
helping
her
i
see
as
she
looks
any
worse
than
she
did
a
year
ago
sadie
turned
slowly
around
toward
her
sister
ester
i
do
know
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
know
that
florence
vane
has
the
consumption
and
you
know
that
she
is
my
friend
ester
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
herself
save
that
this
had
been
the
hardest
day
from
first
to
last
that
she
had
ever
known
and
she
was
rasped
until
there
was
no
good
feeling
left
in
her
heart
to
touch
little
minnie
had
given
her
the
last
hardening
touch
of
the
day
by
exclaiming
as
she
was
being
hugged
and
kissed
with
eager
passionate
kisses
oh
auntie
essie
you
cried
tears
on
my
white
apron
and
put
out
all
the
starch
ester
set
her
down
hastily
and
went
away
certainly
ester
was
cross
and
miserable
van
anden
was
one
of
her
thorns
he
crossed
her
path
quite
often
either
with
close
searching
words
about
or
grave
silence
she
disliked
him
sadie
as
from
her
pillow
she
watched
her
sister
in
the
moonlight
kneel
down
hastily
and
knew
that
she
was
repeating
a
few
words
of
prayer
thought
of
arnett
words
spoken
that
evening
and
with
her
heart
throbbing
still
under
the
sharp
tones
concerning
florence
sighed
a
little
and
said
within
herself
i
should
not
wonder
if
harry
were
right
and
ester
was
so
much
asleep
that
she
did
not
know
at
least
did
not
realize
that
she
had
dishonored
her
master
all
that
day
chapter
iii
florence
vane
of
the
same
opinion
concerning
florence
was
ester
a
few
weeks
later
when
one
evening
as
she
was
hurrying
past
him
van
anden
detained
her
i
want
to
see
you
a
moment
miss
ester
during
these
weeks
ester
had
been
roused
sadie
was
sick
had
been
sick
enough
to
awaken
many
anxious
fears
sick
enough
for
ester
to
discover
what
a
desolate
house
theirs
would
have
been
supposing
her
merry
music
had
been
hushed
forever
she
discovered
too
how
very
much
she
loved
her
bright
young
sister
she
had
been
very
kind
and
attentive
but
the
fever
was
gone
now
and
sadie
was
well
enough
to
rove
around
the
house
again
and
ester
began
to
think
that
it
could
be
so
very
hard
to
have
loving
hands
ministering
to
one
simplest
want
to
be
cared
for
and
watched
over
and
petted
every
hour
in
the
day
she
was
returning
to
her
impatient
irritable
life
she
forgot
how
high
the
fever
had
been
at
night
and
how
the
young
head
had
ached
and
only
remembered
how
thoroughly
tired
she
was
watching
and
ministering
day
and
night
so
when
she
followed
van
anden
to
the
in
answer
to
his
i
want
to
see
you
miss
ester
it
was
a
very
sober
not
altogether
pleasant
face
which
listened
to
his
words
florence
vane
is
very
sick
some
one
should
be
with
her
besides
the
housekeeper
i
thought
of
you
will
you
watch
with
her
if
any
reasonable
excuse
could
have
been
found
ester
would
surely
have
said
no
so
foolish
did
this
seem
to
her
why
only
yesterday
she
had
seen
florence
sitting
beside
the
open
window
looking
very
well
but
then
she
was
sadie
friend
and
it
had
been
more
than
two
weeks
since
sadie
had
needed
watching
with
at
night
so
ester
could
not
plead
fatigue
i
suppose
so
she
answered
slowly
to
the
waiting
doctor
hearing
which
he
wheeled
and
left
her
turning
back
though
to
say
do
not
mention
this
to
sadie
in
her
present
state
of
body
i
care
to
have
her
excited
very
careful
you
are
of
everybody
muttered
ester
as
he
hastened
away
tell
her
what
i
wonder
that
you
are
making
much
ado
about
nothing
for
the
sake
of
showing
your
astonishing
skill
in
precisely
this
state
of
mind
she
went
a
few
hours
later
over
to
the
cottage
into
the
quiet
room
where
florence
lay
asleep
and
for
aught
she
could
see
sleeping
as
quietly
as
young
fresh
life
ever
did
what
do
you
think
of
her
whispered
the
old
lady
who
acted
as
housekeeper
nurse
and
mother
to
the
orphaned
florence
i
think
i
have
seen
her
look
better
this
great
while
ester
answered
abruptly
well
i
ca
say
as
she
looks
any
worse
to
either
but
van
anden
is
in
a
fidget
and
i
suppose
he
knows
what
he
about
the
doctor
came
in
at
eleven
stood
for
a
moment
by
the
bedside
glanced
at
the
old
lady
who
was
dozing
in
her
then
came
over
to
ester
and
spoke
low
i
ca
trust
the
nurse
she
has
been
broken
of
her
rest
and
is
weary
i
want
to
keep
awake
if
she
nodding
toward
florence
stirs
give
her
a
spoonful
from
that
tumbler
on
the
stand
i
shall
be
back
at
twelve
if
she
wakens
you
may
call
her
father
and
send
john
for
me
he
in
the
kitchen
i
shall
be
around
the
corner
at
vinton
then
he
went
away
softly
as
he
had
come
the
lamp
burned
low
over
by
the
window
the
nurse
slept
on
in
her
and
ester
sat
with
eyes
fixed
on
florence
and
all
this
time
she
thought
that
the
doctor
was
engaged
in
getting
up
a
scene
the
story
of
which
should
go
forth
next
day
in
honor
of
his
skill
and
faithfulness
yet
having
come
to
watch
she
would
not
sleep
at
her
post
even
though
she
believed
in
her
heart
that
were
she
sleeping
by
sadie
side
and
the
doctor
quiet
in
his
own
room
all
would
go
on
well
until
the
morning
but
the
doctor
evident
anxiety
had
driven
sleep
from
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
whose
one
darling
lay
quiet
on
the
bed
he
came
in
very
soon
after
the
doctor
had
departed
i
ca
sleep
he
said
in
explanation
to
ester
some
way
i
feel
worried
does
she
seem
worse
to
you
not
a
bit
ester
said
promptly
i
think
she
looks
better
than
usual
yes
vane
answered
in
an
encouraged
tone
and
she
has
been
quite
bright
all
day
but
the
doctor
is
all
down
about
her
he
say
a
single
cheering
word
ester
indignation
grew
upon
her
he
might
at
least
have
let
this
old
man
sleep
in
peace
she
said
sharply
in
her
heart
at
twelve
precisely
the
doctor
returned
he
went
directly
to
the
bedside
how
has
she
been
he
asked
of
ester
in
passing
just
as
she
is
now
ester
voice
was
not
only
dry
but
sarcastic
vane
scanned
the
doctor
face
eagerly
but
it
was
grave
and
sad
quiet
reigned
in
the
room
the
two
men
at
florence
side
neither
spoke
nor
stirred
ester
kept
her
seat
across
from
them
and
grew
every
moment
more
sure
that
she
was
right
and
more
provoked
suddenly
the
silence
was
broken
van
anden
bent
low
over
the
sleeper
and
spoke
in
a
gentle
anxious
tone
florence
but
she
neither
stirred
nor
heeded
he
spoke
again
florence
and
the
blue
eyes
unclosed
slowly
and
wearily
the
doctor
drew
back
quickly
and
motioned
her
father
forward
speak
to
her
mr
vane
florence
my
darling
the
old
man
said
with
inexpressible
love
and
tenderness
sounding
in
his
voice
his
fair
young
daughter
turned
her
eyes
on
him
but
the
words
she
spoke
were
not
of
him
or
of
aught
around
her
so
clear
and
sweet
they
sounded
that
ester
sitting
quite
across
the
room
from
her
heard
them
distinctly
i
saw
mother
and
i
saw
my
savior
van
anden
sank
upon
his
knees
as
the
drooping
lids
closed
again
and
his
voice
was
low
and
tremulous
father
into
thy
hands
we
commit
this
spirit
thy
will
be
done
in
a
moment
more
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
the
nurse
was
thoroughly
awakened
the
doctor
cared
for
the
poor
childless
father
with
the
tenderness
of
a
son
then
came
back
to
send
john
for
help
and
to
give
directions
concerning
what
was
to
be
done
through
it
all
ester
sat
motionless
petrified
with
solemn
astonishment
then
the
angel
of
death
had
been
there
in
that
very
room
and
she
had
been
so
wise
in
her
own
conceit
that
she
did
not
know
it
until
he
had
departed
with
the
freed
spirit
florence
really
sick
then
dangerously
sick
the
doctor
had
not
deceived
them
had
not
magnified
the
trouble
as
she
supposed
but
it
could
not
be
that
she
was
dead
dead
why
only
a
few
minutes
ago
she
was
sleeping
so
quietly
well
she
was
very
quiet
now
could
the
heart
have
ceased
its
beating
sadie
florence
dead
poor
sadie
what
would
they
say
to
her
how
they
tell
her
sitting
there
ester
had
some
of
the
most
solemn
thoughts
that
she
had
ever
known
god
angel
had
been
present
in
that
room
and
in
what
a
spirit
had
he
found
this
watcher
van
anden
went
quietly
promptly
from
room
to
room
until
every
thing
in
the
suddenly
stricken
household
was
as
it
should
be
then
he
came
to
ester
i
will
go
over
home
with
you
now
he
said
speaking
low
and
kindly
he
seemed
to
under
stand
just
how
shocked
she
felt
they
went
in
the
night
and
darkness
across
the
street
saying
nothing
as
the
doctor
applied
his
key
to
the
door
ester
spoke
in
low
distressed
tones
doctor
van
anden
i
did
not
think
i
did
not
dream
then
she
stopped
i
know
he
said
kindly
it
was
unexpected
thought
she
would
linger
until
morning
perhaps
through
the
day
indeed
i
was
so
sure
that
i
ventured
to
keep
my
worst
fears
from
vane
i
wanted
him
to
rest
i
am
sorry
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
prepared
him
but
even
or
at
midnight
or
at
the
or
in
the
morning
you
see
we
know
not
which
i
thank
god
that
to
florence
it
did
not
matter
those
days
which
followed
were
days
of
great
opportunity
to
ester
if
she
had
but
known
how
to
use
them
sadie
sad
softened
heart
into
which
grief
had
entered
might
have
been
turned
by
a
few
kind
skillful
words
from
thoughts
of
florence
to
florence
savior
ester
try
she
was
kinder
more
gentle
with
the
young
sister
than
was
her
wont
to
be
and
once
when
sadie
was
lingering
fondly
over
memories
of
her
friend
she
said
in
an
awkward
blundering
way
something
about
florence
having
been
prepared
to
die
and
hoping
that
sadie
would
follow
her
example
sadie
looked
surprised
but
answered
gravely
i
never
expect
to
be
like
florence
she
was
perfect
or
at
least
i
sure
i
could
never
see
any
thing
about
her
that
was
perfection
you
know
ester
she
never
did
any
thing
wrong
and
ester
unused
to
it
and
confused
with
her
own
attempt
kept
silence
and
let
poor
sadie
rest
upon
the
thought
that
it
was
florence
goodness
which
made
her
ready
to
die
instead
of
the
blood
of
jesus
so
the
time
passed
the
grass
grew
green
over
florence
grave
and
sadie
missed
her
indeed
yet
the
serious
thoughts
grew
daily
fainter
and
ester
golden
opportunity
for
leading
her
to
christ
was
lost
chapter
iv
the
sunday
lesson
alfred
and
julia
ried
were
in
the
studying
their
lessons
those
two
were
generally
to
be
found
together
being
twins
they
had
commenced
together
and
had
thus
far
gone
side
by
side
it
was
a
quiet
october
sabbath
afternoon
the
twins
had
a
great
deal
of
business
on
hand
during
the
week
and
the
lesson
used
to
stand
a
fair
chance
of
being
forgotten
so
ried
had
made
a
law
that
half
an
hour
of
every
sabbath
afternoon
should
be
spent
in
studying
the
lesson
for
the
coming
sabbath
ester
sat
in
the
same
room
by
the
window
she
had
been
reading
but
her
book
had
fallen
idly
in
her
lap
and
she
seemed
lost
in
thought
sadie
too
was
there
carrying
on
a
whispered
conversation
with
minnie
who
was
snugged
close
in
her
arms
and
merry
bursts
of
laughter
came
every
few
minutes
from
the
little
girl
the
idea
of
sadie
keeping
quiet
herself
or
of
keeping
any
body
else
quiet
was
simply
absurd
but
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
resist
not
evil
but
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
other
also
read
julia
slowly
and
thoughtfully
alfred
what
do
you
suppose
that
can
mean
do
know
i
sure
alfred
said
the
next
one
is
just
as
queer
if
any
man
will
sue
thee
at
the
law
and
take
away
thy
coat
let
him
have
thy
cloak
also
i
like
to
see
doing
that
i
fight
for
it
i
reckon
oh
alfred
you
would
if
the
bible
said
you
must
would
you
i
do
suppose
this
means
us
at
all
said
alfred
using
unconsciously
the
argument
of
all
who
have
tried
to
slip
away
from
gospel
teaching
since
adam
time
i
suppose
it
talking
to
those
wicked
old
fellows
who
lived
before
the
flood
or
some
such
time
well
said
julia
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
all
means
i
wish
mother
would
come
home
i
wonder
how
vincent
is
do
you
suppose
she
will
die
alfred
do
know
just
hear
this
julia
i
say
unto
you
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
and
persecute
you
you
like
to
see
anybody
who
did
all
that
sadie
said
julia
rising
suddenly
and
moving
over
to
where
the
frolic
was
going
on
wo
you
tell
us
about
our
lesson
we
understand
a
bit
about
it
and
i
ca
learn
any
thing
that
i
understand
bless
your
heart
child
i
suspect
you
know
more
about
the
bible
this
minute
than
i
do
mother
was
too
busy
taking
care
of
you
two
when
i
was
a
little
chicken
to
teach
me
as
she
has
you
well
but
what
that
mean
a
man
strikes
you
on
one
cheek
let
him
strike
the
other
too
yes
said
alfred
chiming
in
and
anybody
takes
your
coat
away
give
him
your
cloak
too
i
suppose
it
means
just
that
said
sadie
if
anybody
steals
your
mittens
as
that
bush
girl
did
yours
last
winter
julia
you
are
to
take
your
hood
right
off
and
give
it
to
her
oh
sadie
you
ever
mean
that
and
then
continued
sadie
gravely
if
that
should
satisfy
her
you
had
better
take
off
your
shoes
and
stockings
and
give
her
them
sadie
said
ester
how
you
teach
those
children
such
nonsense
she
is
teaching
any
thing
interrupted
alfred
i
guess
i
ai
such
a
dunce
as
to
swallow
all
that
stuff
well
said
sadie
meekly
i
sure
i
doing
the
best
i
can
and
you
are
all
finding
fault
i
explained
to
the
best
of
abilities
julia
i
tell
you
the
truth
and
for
a
moment
her
laughing
face
grew
sober
i
do
know
the
least
thing
about
it
do
pretend
to
why
do
you
ask
ester
she
can
tell
you
more
about
the
bible
in
a
minute
i
presume
than
i
could
in
a
year
ester
laid
her
book
on
the
window
julia
bring
your
bible
here
she
said
gravely
now
what
is
the
matter
i
never
heard
you
make
such
a
commotion
over
your
lesson
mother
always
explains
it
said
alfred
and
she
has
got
back
from
vincent
and
i
do
believe
anyone
else
in
this
house
do
it
alfred
said
ester
do
be
impertinent
julia
what
is
that
you
want
to
know
about
the
man
being
struck
on
one
cheek
how
he
must
let
them
strike
the
other
too
what
does
it
mean
it
means
just
when
girls
are
cross
and
ugly
to
you
you
must
be
good
and
kind
to
them
and
when
a
boy
knocks
down
another
he
must
forgive
him
instead
of
getting
angry
and
knocking
back
ho
said
alfred
contemptuously
never
saw
the
boy
yet
who
would
do
it
that
only
proves
that
boys
are
naughty
quarrelsome
fellows
who
do
obey
what
the
bible
teaches
but
ester
interrupted
julia
anxiously
was
that
true
what
sadie
said
about
me
giving
my
shoes
and
stockings
and
my
hood
to
folks
who
stole
something
from
me
of
course
not
sadie
should
talk
such
nonsense
to
you
that
is
about
men
going
to
law
mother
will
explain
it
when
she
goes
over
the
lesson
with
you
julia
was
only
half
satisfied
what
does
that
verse
mean
about
doing
good
to
them
that
here
i
read
it
said
alfred
i
say
unto
you
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
and
persecute
you
why
that
is
plain
enough
it
means
just
what
it
says
when
people
are
ugly
to
you
and
act
as
though
they
hated
you
you
must
be
very
good
and
kind
to
them
and
pray
for
them
and
love
them
ester
does
god
really
mean
for
us
to
love
people
who
are
ugly
to
us
and
to
be
good
to
them
of
course
well
then
why
do
we
if
god
says
so
ester
why
do
you
that
the
point
exclaimed
sadie
in
her
most
roguish
tone
glad
you
made
the
application
julia
now
ester
heart
had
been
softening
under
the
influence
of
these
peaceful
bible
words
she
believed
them
and
in
her
heart
was
a
real
earnest
desire
to
teach
her
brother
and
sister
bible
truths
left
alone
she
would
have
explained
that
those
who
loved
jesus
struggling
in
a
weak
feeble
way
to
obey
these
directions
that
she
herself
was
trying
trying
sometimes
that
ought
to
but
there
was
this
against
ester
her
whole
life
was
so
at
variance
with
those
plain
searching
bible
rules
that
the
youngest
child
could
not
but
see
it
and
sadie
mischievous
tones
and
evident
relish
of
her
embarrassment
at
julia
question
destroyed
the
thoughts
she
answered
with
severe
dignity
sadie
if
i
were
you
i
would
try
to
make
the
children
as
irreverent
as
i
was
myself
then
she
went
dignifiedly
from
the
room
van
anden
paused
for
a
moment
before
sadie
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
that
same
sadie
said
he
is
there
one
verse
in
the
bible
which
you
have
never
read
plenty
of
them
doctor
i
commenced
reading
the
bible
through
once
but
i
stopped
at
some
chapter
in
numbers
the
thirtieth
i
think
it
is
is
it
or
somewhere
along
there
where
all
those
hard
names
are
you
know
but
why
do
you
ask
the
doctor
opened
a
large
bible
which
lay
on
the
stand
before
them
and
read
aloud
ye
have
perverted
the
words
of
the
living
god
sadie
looked
puzzled
now
doctor
what
ever
possessed
you
to
think
that
i
had
never
read
that
verse
god
counts
that
a
solemn
thing
sadie
very
likely
what
then
i
was
reading
on
the
piazza
when
the
children
came
to
you
for
an
explanation
of
their
lesson
sadie
laughed
did
you
hear
that
conversation
doctor
i
hope
you
were
benefited
then
more
gravely
van
anden
do
you
really
mean
me
to
think
that
i
was
perverting
scripture
certainly
think
so
sadie
were
you
not
giving
the
children
wrong
ideas
concerning
the
teachings
of
our
savior
sadie
was
quite
sober
now
i
told
the
truth
at
last
doctor
i
do
know
any
thing
about
these
matters
people
who
profess
to
be
christians
do
not
live
according
to
our
savior
teaching
at
least
do
see
any
who
do
and
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
that
those
verses
which
the
children
were
studying
mean
what
they
say
or
christian
people
would
surely
to
follow
them
for
an
answer
van
anden
turned
the
bible
leaves
again
and
pointed
with
his
finger
to
this
verse
which
sadie
read
but
as
he
which
has
called
you
is
holy
so
be
ye
holy
in
all
manner
of
conversation
after
that
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
sadie
reading
the
verse
over
again
could
not
but
understand
that
she
have
a
perfect
pattern
if
she
would
chapter
the
poor
little
fish
mother
said
sadie
appearing
in
the
one
morning
holding
julia
by
the
hand
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
fish
who
fell
out
of
the
into
the
fire
which
question
her
mother
answered
by
asking
without
turning
her
eyes
from
the
great
batch
of
bread
which
she
was
molding
what
mischief
are
you
up
to
now
sadie
why
nothing
said
sadie
only
here
is
the
very
fish
so
renowned
in
ancient
history
and
i
brought
her
for
your
inspection
this
answer
brought
ried
eyes
around
from
the
dough
and
fixed
them
upon
julia
and
she
said
as
soon
as
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
forlorn
little
maiden
o
my
a
specimen
requiring
great
patience
from
any
one
coming
in
contact
with
her
was
this
same
julia
the
pretty
blue
dress
and
white
apron
were
covered
with
great
patches
of
mud
morocco
boots
and
neat
white
stockings
were
in
the
same
direful
plight
and
down
her
face
the
salt
and
muddy
tears
were
running
for
her
handkerchief
was
also
streaked
with
mud
i
should
so
laughed
sadie
in
answer
to
her
exclamation
the
history
of
the
poor
little
fish
in
brief
is
this
she
started
immaculate
in
white
apron
white
stockings
and
the
like
for
the
with
ester
letter
she
met
with
temptation
in
the
shape
of
a
little
girl
with
paper
dolls
and
while
admiring
them
the
letter
had
the
meanness
to
slip
out
of
her
hand
into
the
mud
that
you
understand
was
the
much
horrified
with
this
state
of
things
the
two
wise
young
heads
were
put
together
and
the
brilliant
idea
conceived
of
giving
the
muddy
letter
a
thorough
washing
in
the
creek
so
to
the
creek
they
went
and
while
they
stood
ankle
deep
in
the
mud
vigorously
carrying
their
idea
into
effect
the
vicious
little
thing
hopped
out
of
julia
hand
and
sailed
merrily
away
down
stream
so
there
she
was
of
the
into
the
fire
sure
enough
and
the
letter
has
sailed
for
uncle
ralph
by
a
different
route
than
that
which
is
usually
taken
sadie
nonsense
was
interrupted
at
this
point
by
ester
who
had
listened
with
darkening
face
to
the
rapidly
told
story
she
ought
to
be
thoroughly
the
careless
little
goose
mother
if
you
do
punish
her
now
i
never
would
again
then
julia
tearful
sorrow
blazed
into
sudden
anger
i
to
be
whipped
you
an
ugly
mean
sister
to
say
so
i
tumbled
down
and
hurt
my
arm
trying
to
catch
your
old
letter
and
you
just
as
mean
as
you
can
be
between
tears
and
loud
tones
and
sadie
laughter
julia
had
managed
to
burst
forth
these
angry
sentences
before
her
mother
voice
reached
her
when
it
did
she
was
silenced
julia
i
am
is
that
the
way
to
speak
to
your
sister
go
up
to
my
room
directly
and
when
you
have
put
on
dry
clothes
sit
down
there
and
stay
until
you
are
ready
to
tell
ester
that
you
are
sorry
and
ask
her
to
forgive
you
mother
sadie
said
as
the
little
girl
went
stamping
up
the
stairs
her
face
buried
in
her
muddy
handkerchief
i
not
sure
but
you
have
made
a
mistake
and
ester
is
the
one
to
be
sent
to
her
room
until
she
can
behave
better
i
do
pretend
to
be
myself
but
i
must
say
it
seems
ridiculous
to
speak
in
the
way
she
did
to
a
sorry
frightened
child
i
never
saw
a
more
woeful
figure
in
my
life
and
sadie
laughed
again
at
the
recollection
yes
said
ester
you
uphold
her
in
all
sorts
of
mischief
and
insolence
that
is
the
reason
she
is
so
troublesome
to
manage
ried
looked
distressed
do
ester
she
said
do
speak
in
that
loud
sharp
tone
sadie
you
should
not
encourage
julia
in
speaking
improperly
to
her
sister
i
think
myself
that
ester
was
hard
with
her
the
poor
child
did
not
mean
any
harm
but
she
must
not
be
rude
to
anybody
oh
yes
ester
said
speaking
bitterly
of
course
am
the
one
to
blame
i
always
no
one
in
this
house
ever
does
any
thing
wrong
except
ried
sighed
heavily
and
sadie
turned
away
and
ran
up
stairs
humming
oh
would
i
were
a
buttercup
a
blossom
in
the
meadow
and
julia
in
her
mother
room
exchanged
her
wet
and
muddy
garments
for
clean
ones
and
washed
her
face
in
the
clear
pure
water
until
it
was
fresh
and
clean
and
cried
again
louder
and
harder
her
heart
was
all
bruised
and
bleeding
she
had
not
meant
to
be
careless
she
had
been
carefully
dressed
that
morning
to
spend
the
long
bright
saturday
with
vesta
griswold
she
had
intended
to
go
swiftly
and
safely
to
the
with
the
small
white
treasure
intrusted
to
her
care
but
those
paper
dolls
were
pretty
and
of
course
there
was
no
harm
in
walking
along
with
addie
and
looking
at
them
how
could
she
know
that
the
hateful
letter
was
going
to
tumble
out
of
her
apron
pocket
right
there
too
the
only
place
along
the
road
where
there
was
the
least
bit
of
mud
to
be
seen
then
she
had
honestly
supposed
that
a
little
clean
water
from
the
creek
applied
with
her
smooth
white
handkerchief
would
take
the
stains
right
out
of
the
envelope
and
the
sun
would
dry
it
and
it
would
go
safely
to
uncle
ralph
after
all
but
instead
of
that
the
hateful
thing
slipped
right
out
of
her
hand
and
went
floating
down
the
stream
and
at
this
point
julia
sobs
burst
forth
afresh
presently
she
took
up
her
broken
thread
of
thought
and
went
on
how
very
ugly
ester
was
if
had
been
there
her
mother
would
have
listened
kindly
to
her
story
of
how
very
sorry
she
was
and
how
she
meant
to
do
just
right
then
she
would
have
forgiven
her
and
she
would
have
been
freshly
dressed
in
her
clean
blue
dress
instead
of
her
pink
one
and
would
have
had
her
happy
day
after
all
and
now
she
would
have
to
spend
this
bright
day
all
alone
and
at
this
point
her
tears
rolled
down
in
torrents
jule
called
a
familiar
voice
under
her
window
where
are
you
come
down
and
mend
my
sail
for
me
wo
you
julia
went
to
the
window
and
poured
into
alfred
sympathetic
ears
the
story
of
her
grief
and
her
wrongs
just
exactly
like
her
was
his
comment
on
ester
share
in
the
tragedy
she
grows
crosser
every
day
i
guess
if
i
were
you
i
let
her
wait
a
spell
before
i
asked
her
forgiveness
i
guess
i
shall
sputtered
julia
she
was
meaner
than
any
thing
and
i
tell
her
so
this
minute
if
i
saw
her
that
all
the
sorry
i
am
so
the
talk
went
on
and
when
alfred
was
called
to
get
ester
a
pail
of
water
and
left
julia
in
solitude
she
found
her
heart
very
much
strengthened
in
its
purpose
to
tire
everybody
out
in
waiting
for
her
apology
the
long
warm
busy
day
moved
on
and
the
overworked
and
wearied
mother
found
time
to
toil
up
two
flights
of
stairs
in
search
of
her
young
daughter
in
the
hope
of
soothing
and
helping
her
but
julia
was
in
no
mood
to
be
helped
she
hated
to
stay
up
there
alone
she
wanted
to
go
down
in
the
garden
with
alfred
she
wanted
to
go
to
the
arbor
and
read
her
new
book
she
wanted
to
take
a
walk
down
by
the
river
she
wanted
her
dinner
exceedingly
but
to
ask
ester
forgiveness
was
the
one
thing
that
she
did
want
to
do
no
not
if
she
staid
there
alone
for
a
week
not
if
she
she
said
aloud
stamping
her
foot
and
growing
indignant
over
the
thought
alfred
came
as
often
as
his
saturday
occupations
would
admit
and
held
emphatic
talks
with
the
little
prisoner
above
admiring
her
pluck
and
assuring
her
that
he
would
give
in
not
he
you
see
i
do
it
said
julia
with
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
in
her
eyes
because
it
would
be
true
i
sorry
and
mother
would
have
me
tell
a
lie
for
anybody
so
the
sun
went
toward
the
west
and
julia
at
the
window
watched
the
academy
girls
moving
homeward
from
their
afternoon
ramble
listened
to
the
preparations
for
tea
which
were
being
made
among
the
dishes
in
the
and
having
no
more
tears
to
shed
sighed
wearily
and
wished
the
miserable
day
were
quite
done
and
she
was
sound
asleep
only
a
few
moments
before
she
had
received
a
third
visit
from
her
mother
and
turning
to
her
fresh
from
a
talk
with
alfred
she
had
answered
her
mother
question
as
to
whether
she
were
not
now
ready
to
ask
ester
forgiveness
with
quite
as
sober
and
determined
a
no
as
she
had
given
that
day
and
her
mother
had
gravely
and
sadly
answered
i
am
very
sorry
julia
i
ca
come
up
here
again
i
am
too
tired
for
that
you
may
come
to
me
if
you
wish
to
see
me
any
time
before
seven
after
that
you
must
go
to
your
room
and
with
this
julia
had
let
her
depart
only
saying
as
the
door
closed
then
i
can
be
asleep
before
ester
comes
up
i
glad
of
that
i
would
look
at
her
again
for
anything
and
then
julia
was
once
more
summoned
to
the
window
jule
alfred
said
with
less
decision
in
his
voice
than
there
had
been
before
mother
looked
awful
tired
when
she
came
down
stairs
just
now
and
there
was
a
tear
rolling
down
her
cheek
there
was
said
julia
in
a
shocked
and
troubled
tone
and
i
guess
alfred
continued
she
had
a
time
of
it
ester
is
too
cross
even
to
look
at
and
they
been
working
all
day
and
minnie
tumbled
over
the
and
got
hurt
and
mother
held
her
most
an
hour
and
i
guess
she
feels
real
bad
about
this
she
told
sadie
she
felt
sorry
for
you
silence
for
a
little
while
at
the
window
above
and
from
the
boy
below
then
he
broke
forth
suddenly
i
say
jule
had
you
better
do
it
after
all
not
for
ester
but
there
mother
you
know
but
alfred
interrupted
the
truthful
and
puzzled
julia
what
can
i
do
about
it
you
know
i
to
tell
ester
that
i
sorry
and
that
will
not
be
true
this
question
also
troubled
alfred
it
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
these
two
foolish
young
heads
that
she
to
be
sorry
for
her
own
angry
words
no
matter
how
much
in
the
wrong
another
had
been
so
they
stood
with
grave
faces
and
thought
about
it
alfred
found
a
way
out
of
the
mist
at
last
see
here
are
you
sorry
that
you
could
go
to
vesta
and
had
to
stay
up
there
alone
all
day
and
that
it
bothered
mother
of
course
said
julia
i
real
sorry
about
mother
alfred
did
i
honestly
make
her
cry
yes
you
did
alfred
answered
earnestly
i
saw
that
tear
as
plain
as
day
now
you
see
you
can
tell
ester
you
sorry
just
as
well
as
not
because
if
you
had
said
any
thing
to
her
mother
could
have
made
it
all
right
so
of
course
you
sorry
well
said
julia
slowly
rather
bewildered
still
that
sounds
as
if
it
was
right
and
yet
somehow
well
alfred
you
wait
for
me
and
i
be
down
right
away
so
it
happened
that
a
very
penitent
little
face
stood
at
her
elbow
a
few
moments
after
this
and
julia
voice
was
very
earnest
mother
i
so
sorry
i
made
you
such
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
the
patient
mother
turned
and
kissed
the
flushed
cheek
and
answered
kindly
mother
will
forgive
you
have
you
seen
ester
my
daughter
no
spoken
more
faintly
but
i
going
to
find
her
right
away
and
ester
answered
the
troubled
little
voice
with
a
cold
actions
speak
louder
than
words
i
hope
you
will
show
how
sorry
you
are
by
behaving
better
in
future
stand
out
of
my
way
is
it
all
done
up
alfred
asked
a
moment
later
as
she
joined
him
on
the
piazza
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
beauty
of
this
day
which
had
opened
so
brightly
for
her
yes
with
a
relieved
sigh
and
alfred
i
never
mean
to
be
such
a
woman
as
ester
is
when
i
grow
up
i
would
for
the
world
i
mean
to
be
nice
and
good
and
kind
like
sister
sadie
chapter
vi
something
happens
now
the
letter
which
had
caused
so
much
trouble
in
the
ried
family
and
especially
in
ester
heart
was
in
one
sense
not
an
ordinary
letter
it
had
been
written
to
ester
cousin
abbie
her
one
intimate
friend
uncle
ralph
only
daughter
these
two
of
the
same
age
had
been
correspondents
almost
from
their
babyhood
and
yet
they
had
never
seen
each
other
faces
to
go
to
new
york
to
her
uncle
house
to
see
and
be
with
cousin
abbie
had
been
the
one
great
dream
of
ester
heart
as
likely
to
be
realized
she
could
not
help
acknowledging
as
a
journey
to
the
moon
and
no
more
so
new
york
was
at
least
five
hundred
miles
away
and
the
money
necessary
to
carry
her
there
seemed
like
a
small
fortune
to
ester
to
say
nothing
of
the
endless
additions
to
her
wardrobe
which
would
have
to
be
made
before
she
would
account
herself
ready
so
she
contented
herself
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
truthful
to
say
she
made
herself
discontented
with
ceaseless
dreams
over
what
new
york
and
her
uncle
family
and
above
all
cousin
abbie
were
like
and
whether
she
would
ever
see
them
and
why
it
had
always
happened
that
something
was
sure
to
prevent
abbie
visits
to
herself
and
whether
she
should
like
her
as
well
if
she
could
be
with
her
as
she
did
now
and
a
hundred
other
confused
and
disconnected
thoughts
about
them
all
ester
had
no
idea
what
this
miserable
restless
dreaming
of
hers
was
doing
for
her
she
did
not
see
that
her
very
desires
after
a
better
life
which
were
sometimes
strong
upon
her
were
colored
with
impatience
and
envy
cousin
abbie
was
a
christian
and
wrote
her
some
earnest
letters
but
to
ester
it
seemed
a
very
easy
matter
indeed
for
one
who
was
surrounded
as
she
imagined
abbie
to
be
by
luxury
and
love
to
be
a
joyous
eager
christian
into
this
very
letter
that
poor
julia
had
sent
sailing
down
the
stream
some
of
her
inmost
feelings
had
been
poured
do
think
me
devoid
of
all
aspirations
after
something
higher
so
the
letter
ran
dear
abbie
you
in
your
sunny
home
can
never
imagine
how
wildly
i
long
sometimes
to
be
free
from
my
surroundings
free
from
petty
cares
and
trials
and
vexations
which
i
feel
are
eating
out
my
very
life
oh
to
be
free
for
one
hour
to
feel
myself
at
liberty
for
just
one
day
to
follow
my
own
tastes
and
inclinations
to
be
the
person
i
believe
god
designed
me
to
be
to
fill
the
niche
i
believe
he
designed
me
to
fill
abbie
i
my
life
i
have
not
a
happy
moment
it
is
all
rasped
and
warped
and
unlovely
i
am
nothing
and
i
know
it
and
i
had
rather
for
my
own
comfort
be
like
the
most
of
those
who
surround
me
nothing
and
not
know
it
sometimes
i
can
not
help
asking
myself
why
i
was
made
as
i
am
why
ca
i
be
a
clod
a
plodder
and
drag
my
way
with
stupid
good
nature
through
this
miserable
world
instead
of
chafing
and
bruising
myself
at
every
step
now
it
would
be
very
natural
to
suppose
that
a
young
lady
with
a
grain
of
sense
left
in
her
brains
would
in
cooler
moments
have
been
rather
glad
than
otherwise
to
have
such
a
restless
unhappy
unchristianlike
letter
hopelessly
lost
but
ester
felt
as
has
been
seen
thoroughly
angry
that
so
much
lofty
sentiment
which
she
mistook
for
religion
was
entirely
lost
yet
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
one
word
of
this
rebellious
outbreak
was
written
simply
for
effect
ester
when
she
wrote
that
she
hated
her
life
was
thoroughly
and
miserably
in
earnest
when
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
room
she
paced
her
floor
that
evening
and
murmured
despairingly
oh
if
something
would
happen
to
rest
me
for
just
a
little
while
she
was
more
thoroughly
in
earnest
than
any
human
being
who
feels
that
christ
has
died
to
save
her
and
that
she
has
an
eternal
prepared
for
her
and
waiting
to
receive
her
has
any
right
to
feel
on
such
a
subject
yet
though
the
letter
had
never
reached
its
destination
the
pitying
savior
looking
down
upon
his
poor
foolish
lamb
in
tender
love
made
haste
to
prepare
an
answer
to
her
wild
rebellious
cry
for
help
even
though
she
cried
blindly
without
a
thought
of
the
helper
who
is
sufficient
for
all
human
needs
long
looked
for
come
at
last
and
sadie
clear
voice
rang
through
the
and
a
moment
after
that
young
lady
herself
reached
the
holding
up
for
ester
view
a
dainty
envelope
directed
in
a
yet
more
dainty
hand
to
miss
ester
ried
here
that
wonderful
letter
from
cousin
abbie
which
you
have
sent
me
to
the
after
three
times
a
day
for
as
many
weeks
it
reached
here
by
the
way
of
cape
horn
i
should
say
by
its
appearance
it
has
been
remailed
twice
ester
set
her
pail
down
hastily
seized
the
letter
and
retired
to
the
privacy
of
the
pantry
to
devour
it
and
for
once
was
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
sadie
lunched
on
bits
of
cake
broken
from
the
smooth
square
loaf
while
she
waited
to
hear
the
news
anything
special
ried
asked
pausing
in
the
doorway
which
question
ester
answered
by
turning
a
flushed
and
eager
face
toward
them
as
she
passed
the
letter
to
sadie
with
permission
to
read
it
aloud
surprised
into
silence
by
the
unusual
confidence
sadie
read
the
dainty
epistle
without
comment
my
dear
ester
i
in
a
grand
flurry
and
shall
therefore
not
stop
for
long
stories
but
come
at
the
pith
of
the
matter
immediately
we
want
you
that
is
nothing
new
you
are
aware
as
we
have
been
wanting
you
for
many
a
day
but
there
is
new
decision
in
my
plans
and
new
inducements
this
time
we
not
only
want
but
have
you
please
do
say
to
me
this
once
we
are
going
to
have
a
wedding
in
our
house
and
we
need
your
presence
and
wisdom
and
taste
father
says
you
ca
be
your
mother
daughter
if
you
have
exquisite
taste
i
am
very
busy
helping
to
get
the
bride
in
order
which
is
a
work
of
time
and
patience
and
i
do
so
much
need
your
aid
besides
the
bride
is
your
uncle
ralph
only
daughter
so
of
course
you
ought
to
be
interested
in
her
ester
come
father
says
the
inclosed
fifty
dollars
is
a
present
from
him
which
you
must
honor
by
letting
it
pay
your
fare
to
new
york
just
as
soon
as
possible
the
wedding
is
fixed
for
the
and
we
want
you
here
at
least
three
weeks
before
that
brother
ralph
is
to
be
first
groomsman
and
he
especially
needs
your
assistance
as
the
bride
has
named
you
for
her
first
bridesmaid
i
to
dress
i
mean
the
bride
is
to
dress
in
white
and
mother
has
a
dress
prepared
for
the
bridesmaid
to
match
hers
so
that
matter
need
not
delay
or
cause
you
anxiety
this
letter
is
getting
too
long
i
meant
it
to
be
very
brief
and
pointed
i
designed
every
other
word
to
be
but
after
all
i
do
not
believe
you
will
need
so
much
urging
to
be
with
us
at
this
time
i
flatter
myself
that
you
love
me
enough
to
come
to
me
if
you
can
so
leaving
ralph
to
write
directions
concerning
route
and
trains
i
will
run
and
try
on
the
bride
bonnet
which
has
just
come
home
there
is
to
be
a
groom
as
well
as
a
bride
though
i
see
i
have
said
nothing
concerning
him
never
mind
you
shall
see
him
when
you
come
dear
ester
there
is
a
word
of
tense
in
this
letter
i
know
but
i
have
time
to
put
any
in
really
laughed
sadie
as
she
concluded
the
reading
this
is
almost
foolish
enough
to
have
been
written
by
me
is
it
splendid
though
ester
i
glad
you
are
i
wish
i
had
corresponded
with
cousin
abbie
myself
a
wedding
of
any
kind
is
a
delicious
novelty
but
a
real
new
york
wedding
and
a
bridesmaid
besides
my
i
a
mind
to
clap
my
hands
for
you
seeing
you
are
too
dignified
to
do
it
yourself
oh
said
ester
from
whose
face
the
flush
had
faded
leaving
it
actually
pale
with
excitement
and
expected
disappointment
you
suppose
i
am
foolish
enough
to
think
i
can
go
do
you
of
course
you
will
go
when
uncle
ralph
has
paid
your
fare
and
more
too
fifty
dollars
will
buy
a
good
deal
besides
a
ticket
to
new
york
mother
do
you
ever
think
of
saying
that
she
ca
go
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
her
she
is
to
go
is
she
why
i
do
know
answered
this
perplexed
mother
i
want
her
to
i
am
sure
yet
i
do
see
how
she
can
be
spared
she
will
need
a
great
many
things
besides
a
ticket
and
fifty
dollars
do
not
go
as
far
as
you
imagine
besides
ester
you
know
i
depend
on
you
so
much
ester
lips
parted
to
speak
and
had
the
words
come
forth
which
were
in
her
heart
they
would
have
been
sharp
and
bitter
ones
about
never
expecting
to
go
anywhere
never
being
able
to
do
any
thing
but
work
but
sadie
eager
voice
was
quicker
than
hers
oh
now
mother
it
is
no
use
to
talk
in
that
way
i
quite
set
my
heart
on
ester
going
i
never
expect
to
have
an
invitation
there
myself
so
i
must
take
my
honors
secondhand
mother
it
is
time
you
learned
to
depend
on
me
a
little
i
two
inches
taller
than
ester
and
i
no
doubt
i
shall
develop
into
a
remarkable
person
when
she
is
where
we
ca
all
lean
upon
her
school
closes
this
very
week
you
know
and
we
have
vacation
until
october
abbie
could
have
chosen
a
better
time
whom
do
you
suppose
she
is
to
marry
what
a
queer
creature
not
to
tell
us
say
she
can
go
mother
quick
sadie
last
point
was
a
good
one
in
ried
opinion
perhaps
the
giddy
sadie
at
once
her
pride
and
her
anxiety
might
learn
a
little
by
feeling
a
shadow
of
the
weight
of
care
which
rested
continually
on
ester
you
certainly
need
the
change
she
said
her
eyes
resting
pityingly
on
the
young
careworn
face
of
her
eldest
daughter
but
how
could
we
manage
about
your
wardrobe
your
black
silk
is
nice
to
be
sure
but
you
would
need
one
bright
evening
dress
at
least
and
you
know
we
have
the
money
to
spare
then
sadie
thoughtless
selfish
sadie
who
was
never
supposed
to
have
one
care
for
others
and
very
little
for
herself
sadie
who
vexed
ester
nearly
every
hour
in
the
day
by
what
at
the
time
always
seemed
some
especially
selfish
heedless
act
suddenly
shone
out
gloriously
she
stood
still
and
actually
seemed
to
think
for
a
full
minute
while
ester
jerked
a
pan
of
potatoes
toward
her
and
commenced
peeling
vigorously
then
she
clapped
her
hands
and
gave
vent
to
little
gleeful
shouts
before
she
exclaimed
oh
mother
mother
i
have
it
exactly
i
wonder
we
did
think
of
it
before
there
my
blue
silk
just
the
thing
i
am
tall
and
she
is
short
so
it
will
make
her
a
beautiful
train
dress
wo
that
do
splendidly
the
magnitude
of
this
proposal
awed
even
ester
into
silence
to
be
appreciated
it
must
be
understood
that
sadie
ried
had
never
in
her
life
possessed
a
silk
dress
ried
best
black
silk
had
long
ago
been
cut
over
for
ester
so
had
her
brown
and
white
plaid
so
there
had
been
nothing
of
the
sort
to
remodel
for
sadie
and
this
elegant
silk
had
been
lying
in
its
covering
for
more
than
two
years
it
was
the
gift
of
a
dear
friend
of
ried
girlhood
to
the
young
beauty
who
bore
her
name
and
had
been
waiting
all
this
time
for
sadie
to
attain
proper
growth
to
admit
of
its
being
cut
into
for
her
meantime
she
had
feasted
her
eyes
upon
it
and
gloried
in
the
prospect
of
that
wonderful
day
when
she
should
sweep
across
the
platform
of
music
hall
with
this
same
silk
falling
in
beautiful
blue
waves
around
her
for
it
had
long
been
settled
that
it
was
to
be
worn
first
on
that
day
when
she
should
graduate
no
wonder
then
that
ester
stood
in
mute
astonishment
while
ried
commented
why
sadie
my
dear
child
is
it
possible
you
are
willing
to
give
up
your
blue
silk
not
a
bit
of
it
mother
i
do
intend
to
give
it
up
the
least
bit
in
the
world
i
merely
going
to
lend
it
it
too
pretty
to
stay
poked
up
in
that
drawer
by
itself
any
longer
i
set
my
heart
on
its
coming
out
this
very
season
just
as
likely
as
not
it
will
learn
to
put
on
airs
for
me
when
i
graduate
i
not
at
all
satisfied
with
my
attainments
in
that
line
so
ester
shall
take
it
to
new
york
and
if
she
sits
down
or
stands
up
or
turns
around
or
has
one
minute
peace
while
she
has
it
on
for
fear
lest
she
should
spot
it
or
tear
it
or
get
it
stepped
on
i
never
forgive
her
and
at
this
harangue
ester
laughed
a
free
glad
laugh
such
as
was
seldom
heard
from
her
some
way
it
began
to
seem
as
if
she
were
really
to
go
sadie
had
such
a
brisk
way
of
saying
ester
shall
take
it
to
new
york
oh
if
she
only
could
go
she
would
be
willing
to
do
after
that
but
one
peep
one
little
peep
into
the
beautiful
magic
world
that
lay
outside
of
that
and
kitchen
she
felt
as
if
she
must
have
perhaps
that
laugh
did
as
much
for
her
as
any
thing
it
almost
startled
ried
with
its
sweetness
and
rarity
what
if
the
change
would
freshen
and
brighten
her
and
bring
her
back
to
them
with
some
of
the
sparkles
that
continually
danced
in
sadie
eyes
but
what
on
the
other
hand
if
she
should
grow
utterly
disgusted
with
the
monotony
of
their
very
quiet
very
busy
life
and
refuse
to
work
in
that
most
necessary
treadmill
any
longer
so
the
mother
argued
and
hesitated
and
the
decision
which
was
to
mean
so
much
more
than
any
of
those
knew
trembled
in
the
balance
for
let
ried
once
find
voice
to
say
oh
ester
i
do
see
but
what
you
will
to
give
it
up
and
ester
would
have
turned
quickly
and
with
curling
lip
to
that
pan
of
potatoes
and
have
sharply
forbidden
any
one
to
mention
the
subject
to
her
again
once
more
sadie
dear
merry
silly
sadie
came
to
the
rescue
mother
oh
mother
what
an
endless
time
you
are
in
coming
to
a
decision
i
could
plan
an
expedition
to
the
north
pole
in
less
time
than
this
i
just
wild
to
have
her
go
i
want
to
hear
how
a
genuine
new
york
bride
looks
besides
you
know
dear
mother
i
want
to
stay
in
the
kitchen
with
you
ester
does
every
thing
and
i
do
have
any
chance
i
perfectly
long
to
bake
and
boil
and
broil
and
brew
things
say
yes
there
a
darling
and
ried
looked
at
the
bright
flushed
face
and
thought
how
little
the
dear
child
knew
about
all
these
matters
and
how
little
patience
poor
ester
who
was
so
competent
herself
would
have
with
sadie
ignorance
and
said
slowly
and
hesitatingly
but
yet
actually
said
well
ester
my
daughter
i
really
think
we
must
try
to
get
along
without
you
for
a
little
while
and
these
three
people
really
seemed
to
think
that
they
had
decided
the
matter
though
two
of
them
were
at
least
theoretical
believers
in
a
special
providence
it
never
once
occurred
to
them
that
this
little
thing
in
all
its
details
had
been
settled
for
ages
chapter

journeying
twenty
minutes
here
for
refreshments
passengers
for
new
york
take
south
track
new
york
daily
papers
here
sweet
oranges
here
and
amid
all
these
yells
of
discordant
tongues
and
the
screeching
of
engines
and
the
ringing
of
bells
and
the
intolerable
din
of
a
merciless
gong
ester
pushed
and
elbowed
her
way
through
the
crowd
almost
panting
with
her
efforts
to
keep
pace
with
her
traveling
companion
a
nervous
country
merchant
on
his
way
to
new
york
to
buy
goods
he
hurried
her
through
the
crowd
and
the
noise
into
the
stood
by
her
side
while
obedient
to
his
orders
she
poured
down
her
throat
a
cup
of
almost
boiling
coffee
then
seating
her
in
the
ladies
room
charged
her
on
no
account
to
stir
from
that
point
while
he
was
gone
he
had
just
time
to
run
around
to
the
and
mail
a
forgotten
letter
then
he
vanished
and
in
the
confusion
and
the
crowd
ester
was
alone
she
did
not
feel
in
the
least
flurried
or
nervous
on
the
contrary
she
liked
it
this
first
experience
of
hers
in
a
city
depot
she
would
not
have
had
it
made
known
to
one
of
the
groups
of
and
travelers
who
thronged
past
her
for
the
world
but
the
truth
was
ester
had
been
having
her
very
first
ride
in
the
cars
sadie
had
made
various
little
trips
in
company
with
school
friends
to
adjoining
towns
after
school
books
or
music
or
to
attend
a
concert
or
for
pure
fun
but
though
ester
had
spent
her
eighteen
years
of
life
in
a
town
which
had
long
been
an
express
station
yet
want
of
time
or
of
money
or
of
inclination
to
take
the
bits
of
journeys
which
alone
were
within
her
reach
had
kept
her
at
home
now
she
glanced
at
herself
at
her
faultlessly
neat
and
ladylike
traveling
suit
she
could
get
a
full
view
of
it
in
an
opposite
mirror
and
it
was
becoming
from
the
dainty
vail
which
fluttered
over
her
hat
to
the
shining
tip
of
her
walking
boots
and
she
gave
a
complacent
little
sigh
as
she
said
to
herself
i
do
see
but
i
look
as
much
like
a
traveler
as
any
of
them
i
sure
i
do
feel
in
the
least
confused
i
glad
i
not
as
ridiculously
dressed
as
that
girl
in
brown
i
should
call
it
in
very
bad
taste
to
wear
such
a
rich
silk
as
that
for
traveling
she
does
look
as
though
she
had
a
single
idea
beyond
dress
probably
that
is
what
is
occupying
her
thoughts
at
this
very
moment
and
ester
speaking
face
betrayed
contempt
and
conscious
superiority
as
she
watched
the
fluttering
bit
of
silk
and
ribbons
opposite
ester
had
a
very
mistaken
opinion
of
herself
in
this
respect
probably
she
would
have
been
startled
and
indignant
had
any
one
told
her
that
her
supposed
contempt
for
the
rich
and
elegant
attire
displayed
all
around
her
was
really
the
outgrowth
of
envy
that
when
she
told
herself
would
lavish
so
much
time
and
thought
and
above
all
on
mere
outside
show
it
was
mere
nonsense
that
she
already
spent
all
the
time
at
her
disposal
and
all
the
money
she
could
possibly
spare
on
the
very
things
which
she
was
condemning
the
truth
was
ester
had
a
perfectly
royal
taste
in
all
these
matters
give
her
but
the
wherewithal
and
she
would
speedily
have
glistened
in
silk
and
sparkled
with
jewels
yet
she
honestly
thought
that
her
bitter
denunciation
of
fashion
and
folly
in
this
form
was
outward
evidence
of
a
mind
elevated
far
above
such
trivial
subjects
and
looked
down
accordingly
with
cool
contempt
on
those
whom
she
was
pleased
to
denominate
butterflies
of
fashion
and
in
her
flights
into
a
higher
sphere
of
thought
this
absurdly
inconsistent
ester
never
once
remembered
how
just
exactly
a
week
ago
that
day
she
had
gone
around
like
a
storm
king
in
her
own
otherwise
peaceful
home
almost
wearing
out
the
patience
of
her
weary
mother
rendered
the
house
intolerable
to
sadie
and
actually
boxed
julia
ears
and
all
because
she
saw
with
her
own
eyes
that
she
really
not
have
her
blue
silk
or
rather
blue
silk
trimmed
with
netted
fringe
at
twelve
shillings
a
yard
but
must
do
with
simple
folds
and
a
heading
such
a
two
weeks
as
the
last
had
been
in
the
ried
family
the
entire
household
had
joined
in
the
commotion
produced
by
ester
projected
visit
it
was
marvelous
how
much
there
was
to
do
ried
toiled
early
and
late
and
made
many
quiet
little
sacrifices
in
order
that
her
daughter
might
not
feel
too
keenly
the
difference
between
her
own
and
her
cousin
wardrobe
sadie
emptied
what
she
denominated
her
finery
box
and
donated
every
article
in
it
delivering
comic
little
lectures
to
each
bit
of
lace
and
ribbon
as
she
smoothed
them
and
patted
them
and
told
them
they
were
going
to
new
york
julia
hemmed
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
pricked
her
poor
little
fingers
unmercifully
and
uncomplainingly
alfred
ran
of
errands
with
remarkable
promptness
but
confessed
to
julia
privately
that
it
was
because
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
have
ester
gone
so
he
could
see
how
it
would
seem
for
everybody
to
be
good
natured
little
minie
got
in
everybody
way
as
much
as
such
a
tiny
creature
could
and
finally
brought
the
tears
to
ester
eyes
and
set
every
one
else
into
bursts
of
laughter
by
bringing
a
very
smooth
little
handkerchief
about
six
inches
square
and
offering
it
as
her
contribution
toward
the
traveler
outfit
as
for
ester
she
was
hurried
and
nervous
and
almost
unendurably
cross
through
the
whole
of
it
wanting
a
hundred
things
which
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
have
and
scorning
not
a
few
little
trifles
that
had
been
prepared
for
her
by
patient
fingers
ester
i
hope
new
york
or
cousin
abbie
or
somebody
will
have
a
soothing
and
improving
effect
upon
you
sadie
had
said
with
a
sort
of
impatience
only
the
night
before
her
departure
now
that
you
have
reached
the
summit
of
your
hopes
you
seem
more
uncomfortable
about
it
than
you
were
even
to
stay
at
home
do
let
us
see
you
look
pleasant
for
just
five
minutes
that
we
may
have
something
good
to
remember
you
by
my
dear
ried
had
interposed
rebukingly
ester
is
hurried
and
tired
remember
and
has
had
a
great
many
things
to
try
her
i
do
think
it
is
a
good
plan
just
as
a
family
are
about
to
separate
to
say
any
careless
or
foolish
words
that
we
do
mean
mother
has
a
great
many
hard
days
of
toil
which
ester
has
given
to
remember
her
by
oh
the
patient
tender
forgiving
mother
ester
being
asleep
to
her
own
faults
never
once
thought
of
the
sharp
fretful
half
disgusted
way
in
which
much
of
her
work
had
been
performed
but
only
remembered
with
a
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
the
many
loaves
of
cake
and
the
rows
of
pies
which
she
had
baked
that
very
morning
in
order
to
save
her
mother
steps
this
was
all
she
thought
of
now
but
there
came
days
when
she
was
meantime
the
new
york
train
after
panting
and
snorting
several
times
to
give
notice
that
the
twenty
minutes
were
about
up
suddenly
puffed
and
rumbled
its
way
out
from
the
depot
and
left
ester
obeying
orders
that
is
sitting
in
the
corner
where
she
had
been
placed
by
newton
being
still
outwardly
but
there
was
in
her
heart
a
perfect
storm
of
vexation
this
comes
of
mother
absurd
fussiness
in
insisting
upon
putting
me
in
newton
care
instead
of
letting
me
travel
alone
as
i
wanted
to
she
fumed
to
herself
now
we
shall
not
get
into
new
york
until
after
six
how
provoking
how
provoking
this
is
newton
exclaimed
her
thoughts
as
he
bustled
in
red
with
haste
and
heat
and
stood
penitently
before
her
i
had
the
least
idea
it
would
take
so
long
to
go
to
the
i
am
very
sorry
well
he
continued
recovering
his
good
humor
notwithstanding
ester
provoking
silence
what
ca
be
cured
must
be
endured
miss
ester
and
it
is
as
bad
as
it
might
be
either
we
only
to
wait
an
hour
and
a
quarter
i
some
errands
to
do
and
i
show
you
the
city
with
pleasure
or
would
you
prefer
sitting
here
and
looking
around
you
i
should
decidedly
prefer
not
running
the
chance
of
missing
the
next
train
ester
answered
very
shortly
so
i
think
it
will
be
wiser
to
stay
where
i
am
in
truth
newton
endured
the
results
of
his
own
carelessness
with
too
much
complacency
to
suit
ester
state
of
mind
but
he
took
no
notice
of
her
hint
further
than
to
assure
her
that
she
need
give
herself
no
uneasiness
on
that
score
he
should
certainly
be
on
time
then
he
went
off
looking
immensely
relieved
for
newton
frankly
confessed
to
himself
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
take
care
of
a
lady
if
she
were
a
parcel
of
goods
now
that
one
could
get
stored
or
checked
and
knew
that
she
would
come
on
all
right
why
but
a
lady
i
not
used
to
it
how
easily
i
could
have
caught
that
train
if
i
had
been
obliged
to
run
back
after
her
but
bless
me
i
would
have
her
know
that
for
the
world
this
he
said
meditatively
as
he
walked
down
south
street
the
new
york
train
had
carried
away
the
greater
portion
of
the
throng
at
the
depot
so
that
ester
and
the
dozen
or
twenty
people
who
occupied
the
great
with
her
had
comparative
quiet
the
wearer
of
the
condemned
brown
silk
and
blue
ribbons
was
still
there
and
awoke
ester
vexation
still
further
by
seeming
utterly
unable
to
keep
herself
quiet
she
fluttered
from
seat
to
seat
and
from
window
to
window
like
an
uneasy
bird
in
a
cage
presently
she
addressed
ester
in
a
bright
little
tone
does
it
bore
you
dreadfully
to
wait
in
a
depot
yes
said
ester
briefly
and
truthfully
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
she
was
having
her
first
experience
in
that
boredom
are
you
going
to
new
york
i
hope
so
she
answered
with
energy
i
expected
to
have
been
almost
there
by
this
time
but
the
gentleman
who
is
supposed
to
be
taking
care
of
me
had
to
rush
off
and
stay
just
long
enough
to
miss
the
train
how
annoying
answered
the
blue
ribbons
with
a
soft
laugh
i
missed
it
too
in
such
a
silly
way
i
just
ran
around
the
corner
to
get
some
chocolate
drops
and
a
little
matter
detained
me
a
few
moments
and
when
i
came
back
the
train
had
gone
i
was
so
sorry
for
i
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
home
do
you
live
in
new
york
ester
shook
her
head
and
thought
within
herself
that
is
just
as
much
sense
as
i
should
suppose
you
to
have
risk
the
chance
of
missing
a
train
for
the
sake
of
a
paper
of
candy
of
course
ester
could
not
be
expected
to
know
that
the
chocolate
drops
were
for
the
wee
sister
at
home
whose
heart
would
be
nearly
broken
if
sister
fanny
came
home
after
an
absence
of
hours
without
bringing
her
any
thing
and
the
little
matter
which
detained
her
a
few
moments
was
joining
the
search
after
a
bill
which
the
ruthless
wind
had
snatched
from
the
hand
of
a
barefooted
bareheaded
and
almost
forlorn
little
girl
who
cried
as
violently
as
though
her
last
hope
in
life
had
been
blown
away
with
it
nor
how
failing
in
finding
the
treasure
the
purse
had
been
opened
and
a
crisp
new
bill
had
been
taken
out
to
fill
its
place
neither
am
i
at
all
certain
as
to
whether
it
would
have
made
any
difference
at
all
in
ester
verdict
if
she
had
known
all
the
circumstances
the
side
door
opened
quietly
just
at
this
point
and
a
man
came
in
carrying
in
one
hand
a
and
in
the
other
a
tin
pail
both
girls
watched
him
curiously
as
he
set
these
down
on
the
floor
and
taking
tacks
from
his
pocket
and
a
hammer
from
his
box
he
proceeded
to
tack
a
piece
of
paper
to
the
wall
ester
from
where
she
sat
could
see
that
the
paper
was
small
and
that
something
was
printed
on
it
in
close
fine
type
it
did
look
in
the
least
like
a
handbill
or
indeed
like
a
notice
of
any
sort
her
desire
to
know
what
it
could
be
grew
strong
two
tiny
tacks
held
it
firmly
in
its
place
then
the
man
turned
and
eyed
the
inmates
of
the
room
who
were
by
this
time
giving
undivided
attention
to
him
and
his
bit
of
paper
presently
he
spoke
in
a
quiet
respectful
tone
i
tacked
up
a
nice
little
tract
i
thought
maybe
while
you
was
waiting
you
might
like
something
to
read
if
one
of
you
would
read
it
aloud
all
the
rest
could
hear
it
so
saying
the
man
stooped
and
took
up
his
and
his
tin
pail
and
went
away
leaving
the
influences
connected
with
those
two
or
three
strokes
of
his
hammer
to
work
for
him
through
all
time
and
meet
him
at
the
judgment
but
if
a
had
suddenly
come
down
and
laid
itself
in
ruins
it
their
feet
it
could
not
have
made
a
much
more
startled
company
than
the
left
behind
him
a
tract
actually
tacked
up
on
the
wall
and
waiting
for
some
human
voice
to
give
it
utterance
a
tract
in
a
railroad
depot
how
queer
how
singular
how
almost
improper
why
oh
ester
did
know
it
was
so
unusual
yes
but
then
that
did
make
it
improper
no
but
then
she
it
well
it
was
fanatical
oh
yes
that
was
it
she
knew
it
was
improper
in
some
way
it
was
strange
that
that
very
convenient
word
should
have
escaped
her
for
a
little
this
talk
ester
held
hurriedly
with
her
conscience
it
was
asleep
you
know
but
just
then
it
nestled
as
in
a
dream
and
gave
her
a
little
prick
but
that
industrious
important
word
fanatical
lulled
it
back
to
its
rest
meantime
there
hung
the
tract
and
fluttered
a
little
in
the
summer
air
as
the
door
opened
and
closed
was
no
one
to
give
it
voice
i
like
dreadful
well
to
hear
it
an
old
lady
said
nodding
her
gray
head
toward
the
little
leaf
on
the
wall
but
i
packed
up
my
specs
and
might
just
as
well
have
no
eyes
at
all
as
far
as
readin
goes
when
i
have
got
my
specs
on
there
some
young
eyes
round
here
though
one
would
think
she
added
looking
inquiringly
around
you
wo
need
glasses
i
should
say
now
for
a
spell
of
years
this
remark
or
hint
or
inquiry
was
directed
squarely
at
ester
and
received
no
other
answer
than
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
and
an
impatient
tapping
of
her
heels
on
the
bare
floor
under
her
breath
ester
muttered
disagreeable
old
woman
the
brown
silk
rustled
and
the
blue
ribbons
fluttered
restlessly
for
a
minute
then
their
owner
clear
voice
suddenly
broke
the
silence
i
read
it
for
you
if
you
really
would
like
to
hear
it
the
wrinkled
homely
happy
old
face
broke
into
a
beaming
smile
as
she
turned
toward
the
maiden
that
i
would
she
answered
heartily
dreadful
well
i
ai
heard
nothing
good
to
me
since
i
started
and
i
come
two
hundred
miles
it
seems
as
if
it
might
kind
of
lift
me
up
and
rest
me
like
to
hear
something
real
good
again
with
the
flush
on
her
face
a
little
hightened
the
young
girl
promptly
crossed
to
where
the
tract
hung
and
a
strange
stillness
settled
over
the
listeners
as
her
clear
voice
sounded
distinctly
down
the
long
room
this
was
what
she
read
solemn
questions
dear
friend
are
you
a
christian
what
have
you
done
for
christ
are
the
friends
with
whom
you
have
been
talking
traveling
toward
the
new
jerusalem
did
you
compare
notes
with
them
as
to
how
you
were
all
prospering
on
the
way
is
that
stranger
by
your
side
a
did
you
ask
him
if
he
be
have
you
been
careful
to
recommend
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
by
your
words
by
your
acts
by
your
looks
this
day
if
danger
comes
to
you
have
you
this
day
asked
christ
to
be
your
helper
if
death
comes
to
you
this
night
are
you
prepared
to
give
up
your
account
what
would
your
record
of
this
last
day
be
a
blank
what
have
you
done
for
the
master
then
what
have
you
done
against
him
nothing
nay
verily
is
not
the
bible
doctrine
that
is
not
for
me
is
against
me
remember
that
every
neglected
opportunity
every
idle
word
every
wrong
thought
of
yours
has
been
written
down
this
day
you
can
not
take
back
the
thoughts
or
words
you
can
not
recall
the
opportunity
this
day
with
all
its
mistakes
and
blots
and
mars
you
can
never
live
over
again
it
must
go
up
to
the
judgment
just
as
it
is
have
you
begged
the
blood
of
jesus
to
be
spread
over
it
all
have
you
resolved
that
no
other
day
shall
witness
a
repeatal
of
the
same
mistakes
have
you
resolved
in
your
own
strength
or
in
his
during
the
reading
of
the
tract
a
young
man
had
entered
paused
a
moment
in
surprise
at
the
unwonted
scene
then
moved
with
very
quiet
tread
across
the
room
and
took
the
vacant
seat
near
ester
as
the
reader
came
back
to
her
former
seat
with
the
pink
on
her
cheek
deepened
into
warm
crimson
the
new
comer
greeted
her
with
miss
fannie
have
you
been
finding
work
to
do
for
the
master
only
a
very
little
thing
she
answered
with
a
voice
in
which
there
was
a
slight
tremble
i
do
know
about
that
my
dear
this
was
the
old
woman
voice
i
sure
i
thank
you
a
great
deal
they
kind
of
startling
questions
like
enough
to
most
scare
a
body
unless
you
was
trying
pretty
hard
now
ai
they
very
solemn
questions
indeed
answered
the
gentleman
to
whom
this
question
seemed
to
be
addressed
i
wonder
if
we
were
each
obliged
to
write
truthful
answers
to
each
one
of
them
how
many
we
should
be
ashamed
to
have
each
other
see
how
many
would
be
ashamed
to
have
see
the
old
woman
spoke
with
an
emphatic
shake
of
her
gray
head
and
a
reverent
touch
of
he
pronoun
that
is
the
vital
point
he
said
yet
how
much
more
ashamed
we
often
seem
to
be
of
man
judgment
than
of
god
then
he
turned
suddenly
to
ester
and
spoke
in
a
quiet
respectful
tone
is
the
stranger
by
my
side
a
ester
was
startled
and
confused
the
whole
scene
had
been
a
very
strange
one
to
her
she
tried
to
think
the
girl
was
dreadfully
out
of
her
sphere
but
the
questions
following
each
other
in
such
quick
succession
were
so
very
solemn
and
personal
and
searching
and
now
this
one
she
hesitated
and
stammered
and
flushed
like
a
as
at
last
she
faltered
i
i
think
i
believe
i
am
then
i
trust
you
are
and
a
faithful
worker
in
the
vineyard
he
said
earnestly
these
are
times
when
the
master
needs
true
and
faithful
workmen
he
a
minister
said
ester
positively
to
herself
when
she
had
recovered
from
her
confusion
sufficiently
to
observe
him
closely
as
he
carefully
folded
the
old
woman
shawl
for
her
took
her
box
and
basket
in
his
care
and
courteously
offered
his
hand
to
assist
her
into
the
cars
for
the
new
york
train
thundered
in
at
last
and
newton
presented
himself
and
they
rushed
and
jostled
each
other
out
of
the
depot
and
into
the
train
and
the
little
tract
hung
quietly
in
its
corner
and
the
carpenter
who
had
left
it
there
hammered
and
sawed
and
planed
yes
and
prayed
that
god
would
use
it
and
knew
not
then
nor
afterward
that
it
had
already
awakened
thoughts
that
would
tell
for
eternity
chapter
viii
the
journey
end
yes
he
a
minister
ester
repeated
even
more
decidedly
as
being
seated
in
the
train
directly
behind
the
old
lady
and
the
young
gentleman
who
had
become
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
she
found
leisure
to
observe
him
more
closely
newton
was
absorbed
in
the
so
she
gave
her
undivided
attention
to
the
two
and
could
hear
snatches
of
the
conversation
which
passed
between
them
as
well
as
note
the
courteous
care
with
which
he
brought
her
a
cup
of
water
and
attended
to
all
her
simple
wants
during
the
stopping
of
the
train
at
a
station
their
talk
became
distinct
and
i
have
seen
my
boy
do
you
think
in
ten
years
the
old
lady
was
saying
wo
he
be
glad
though
to
see
his
mother
once
more
and
he
got
children
two
of
them
one
is
named
after
me
sabrina
it
an
awful
homely
name
i
think
do
you
but
then
you
see
it
was
grandma
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
her
companion
answered
so
the
old
home
is
broken
up
and
you
are
going
to
make
a
new
one
yes
and
i
show
you
every
i
got
to
remember
my
old
garden
by
with
eager
trembling
fingers
she
untied
the
string
which
held
down
the
cover
of
her
basket
and
rummaging
within
brought
to
light
a
withered
bouquet
of
the
very
commonest
and
perhaps
the
very
homeliest
flowers
that
grew
if
there
any
homely
flowers
there
she
said
holding
it
tenderly
and
speaking
with
quivering
lip
and
trembling
voice
i
picked
the
very
last
thing
i
did
out
in
my
own
little
garden
patch
by
the
backdoor
oh
times
and
times
i
sat
and
weeded
and
dug
around
them
with
him
sitting
on
the
stoop
and
reading
out
loud
to
me
i
thought
all
about
just
how
it
was
while
i
was
picking
these
i
did
stay
no
longer
and
i
did
go
back
to
the
house
after
that
i
could
i
just
pulled
my
over
my
eyes
and
went
across
lots
to
where
i
was
going
to
get
my
breakfast
ester
felt
very
sorry
for
the
poor
homeless
friendless
old
woman
felt
as
though
she
would
have
been
willing
to
do
a
good
deal
just
then
to
make
her
comfortable
yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
that
awkward
bunch
of
faded
flowers
arranged
without
the
slightest
regard
to
colors
looked
rather
ridiculous
and
she
felt
surprised
and
not
a
little
puzzled
to
see
actual
tears
standing
in
the
eyes
of
her
companion
as
he
handled
the
bouquet
with
gentle
care
well
he
said
after
a
moment
of
quiet
you
are
not
leaving
your
best
friend
after
all
does
it
comfort
your
heart
very
much
to
remember
that
in
all
your
partings
and
trials
you
are
never
called
upon
to
bid
jesus
what
a
way
he
has
of
bringing
that
subject
into
every
conversation
commented
ester
who
was
now
sure
that
he
was
a
minister
someway
ester
had
fallen
into
a
way
of
thinking
that
every
one
who
spoke
freely
concerning
these
matters
must
be
either
a
fanatic
or
a
minister
oh
that
about
all
the
comfort
i
got
left
this
answer
came
forth
from
a
full
heart
and
eyes
brimming
with
tears
and
i
i
need
any
other
if
i
got
jesus
left
i
ought
to
need
any
thing
else
but
sometimes
i
get
impatient
it
seems
to
me
i
been
here
long
enough
and
it
time
i
got
home
how
is
it
with
the
boy
who
is
expecting
you
has
he
this
same
friend
the
gray
head
was
slowly
and
sorrowfully
shaken
oh
i
afraid
he
do
know
nothing
about
ah
then
you
have
work
to
do
you
ca
be
spared
to
rest
yet
i
presume
the
master
is
waiting
for
you
to
lead
that
son
to
himself
i
mean
to
i
mean
to
sir
she
said
earnestly
but
sometimes
i
think
maybe
my
coffin
could
do
it
better
than
i
but
god
knows
and
i
trying
to
be
patient
then
the
train
whirred
on
again
and
ester
missed
the
rest
but
one
sentence
thrilled
her
maybe
my
coffin
could
do
it
better
than
i
how
earnestly
she
spoke
as
if
she
were
willing
to
die
at
once
if
by
that
she
could
save
her
son
how
earnest
they
both
were
anyway
the
wrinkled
homely
ignorant
old
woman
and
the
cultivated
courtly
gentleman
ester
was
ill
at
ease
conscience
was
arousing
her
to
unwonted
thought
these
two
were
different
from
her
she
was
a
christian
at
least
she
supposed
so
hoped
so
but
she
was
not
like
them
there
was
a
very
decided
difference
were
they
right
and
was
she
all
wrong
was
she
a
christian
after
all
and
at
this
thought
she
actually
shivered
she
was
not
willing
to
give
up
her
title
weak
though
it
might
be
oh
well
she
decided
after
a
little
she
is
an
old
woman
almost
through
with
life
of
course
she
looks
at
everything
through
a
different
aspect
from
what
a
young
girl
like
me
naturally
would
and
as
for
him
ministers
always
are
different
from
other
people
of
course
foolish
ester
did
she
suppose
that
ministers
have
a
private
bible
of
their
own
with
rules
of
life
set
down
therein
for
them
quite
different
from
those
written
for
her
and
as
for
the
old
woman
almost
through
with
life
how
near
might
ester
be
to
the
edge
of
her
own
life
at
that
very
moment
when
the
train
stopped
again
the
two
were
still
talking
i
just
hope
my
boy
will
look
like
you
the
old
lady
said
suddenly
fixing
admiring
eyes
on
the
tall
form
that
stood
beside
her
patiently
waiting
for
the
cup
from
which
she
was
drinking
the
tea
which
he
had
procured
for
her
ester
followed
the
glance
of
her
eye
and
laughed
softly
at
the
extreme
improbability
of
her
hope
being
realized
while
he
answered
gravely
i
hope
he
will
be
a
noble
boy
and
love
his
mother
as
she
deserves
then
it
will
matter
very
little
who
he
looks
like
while
the
cup
was
being
returned
there
was
a
bit
of
toilet
making
going
on
the
gray
hair
was
smoothed
back
under
the
plain
cap
and
the
faded
twisted
shawl
rearranged
and
carefully
pinned
meantime
her
thoughts
seemed
troubled
and
she
looked
up
anxiously
into
the
face
of
her
comforter
as
he
again
took
his
seat
beside
her
i
just
thinking
i
such
a
homely
old
thing
and
new
york
is
such
a
grand
place
i
heard
them
say
i
hope
he
wo
be
ashamed
of
his
mother
no
danger
was
the
hearty
answer
he
think
you
are
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
has
seen
in
ten
years
there
is
no
way
to
describe
the
happy
look
which
shone
in
the
faded
blue
eyes
at
this
answer
and
she
laughed
a
softly
pleased
laugh
as
she
said
maybe
he
be
like
the
man
i
read
about
the
other
day
some
mean
old
scamp
told
him
how
homely
his
mother
was
and
he
said
says
he
she
a
homely
woman
sure
enough
but
oh
she
such
a
mother
what
ever
will
i
do
when
i
get
in
new
york
she
added
quickly
seized
with
a
sudden
anxiety
just
as
like
as
not
now
he
never
got
a
bit
of
my
letter
and
wo
be
there
to
get
me
do
you
know
where
your
son
lives
oh
yes
i
got
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
street
and
the
number
but
bless
your
heart
i
should
know
whether
to
go
up
or
down
or
across
just
the
shadow
of
a
smile
flitted
over
her
friend
face
as
the
thought
of
the
poor
old
lady
trying
to
make
her
way
through
the
city
came
to
him
then
he
hastened
to
reassure
her
then
we
are
all
right
whether
he
meets
you
or
not
we
can
take
a
carriage
and
drive
there
i
will
see
you
safe
at
home
before
i
leave
you
this
crowning
act
of
kindness
brought
the
tears
i
do
know
why
you
are
so
good
to
me
she
said
simply
unless
you
are
the
friend
i
prayed
for
to
help
me
through
this
journey
if
you
are
it
all
right
god
will
see
that
you
are
paid
for
it
and
before
ester
had
done
wondering
over
the
singular
quaintness
of
this
last
remark
there
was
a
sudden
triumphant
shriek
from
the
engine
and
a
tremendous
din
made
up
of
a
confusion
of
more
sounds
than
she
had
ever
heard
in
her
life
before
then
all
was
hurry
and
bustle
around
her
and
she
suddenly
awakened
to
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
they
had
crossed
the
ferry
she
would
actually
be
in
new
york
even
then
she
bethought
herself
to
take
a
curious
parting
look
at
the
oddly
matched
couple
who
were
carefully
making
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
wonder
if
she
would
ever
see
them
again
the
next
hour
was
made
up
of
bewilderment
to
ester
she
had
a
confused
remembrance
afterward
of
floating
across
a
silver
river
in
a
palace
of
reaching
a
place
where
everybody
screamed
instead
of
talked
and
where
all
the
bells
were
ringing
for
fire
or
something
else
she
looked
eagerly
about
for
her
uncle
and
saw
at
least
fifty
men
who
resembled
him
as
she
saw
him
last
about
ten
years
ago
she
fumbled
nervously
for
his
address
in
her
and
gave
newton
a
recipe
for
making
mince
pies
instead
finally
she
found
herself
tumbled
in
among
cushions
and
driving
right
into
carriages
and
carts
and
people
who
all
got
themselves
mysteriously
out
of
the
way
down
streets
that
she
thought
must
surely
be
the
ones
that
the
bells
were
ringing
for
as
they
were
all
ablaze
it
had
been
arranged
that
ester
escort
should
see
her
safely
set
down
at
her
uncle
door
as
she
had
been
unable
to
state
the
precise
time
of
her
arrival
and
besides
as
she
was
an
entire
stranger
to
her
uncle
family
they
could
not
determine
any
convenient
plan
for
meeting
each
other
at
the
depot
so
ester
was
whirled
through
the
streets
at
a
dizzying
rate
and
with
eyes
and
ears
filled
with
bewildering
sights
and
sounds
was
finally
deposited
before
a
great
building
aglow
with
gas
and
gleaming
with
marble
newton
rang
the
bell
and
ester
making
confused
adieus
to
him
was
meantime
ushered
into
a
hall
looking
not
unlike
judge
warren
best
parlor
a
sense
of
awe
not
unmixed
with
loneliness
and
almost
terror
stole
over
her
as
the
man
who
opened
the
door
stood
waiting
after
a
civil
whom
do
you
wish
to
see
and
what
name
shall
i
send
up
whom
she
wish
to
see
and
what
her
name
anyway
could
this
be
her
uncle
house
did
she
want
to
see
any
of
them
she
felt
half
afraid
of
them
all
suddenly
the
dignity
and
grandeur
seemed
to
melt
into
gentleness
before
her
as
the
tiniest
of
little
women
appeared
and
a
bright
young
voice
broke
into
hearty
welcome
is
this
really
my
cousin
ester
and
so
you
have
come
how
perfectly
splendid
where
is
newton
gone
why
john
you
ought
to
have
smuggled
him
in
to
dinner
we
are
much
obliged
to
him
for
taking
care
of
john
send
those
trunks
up
to
my
room
you
room
with
me
ester
wo
you
mother
thought
i
ought
to
put
you
in
solitary
state
in
a
spare
chamber
but
i
could
you
see
i
have
been
so
many
years
waiting
for
you
that
now
i
want
you
every
bit
of
the
time
all
this
while
she
was
giving
her
loving
little
pats
and
kisses
on
their
way
up
stairs
whither
she
at
once
carried
the
traveler
such
a
perfect
gem
of
a
room
as
that
was
into
which
she
was
ushered
love
of
beauty
seemed
likely
to
be
fully
gratified
she
cast
one
eager
glance
around
her
took
in
all
the
charming
little
details
in
a
second
of
time
and
then
gave
her
undivided
attention
to
this
wonderful
person
before
her
who
certainly
was
in
veritable
flesh
and
blood
the
over
for
cousin
abbie
a
hundred
times
had
ester
painted
her
portrait
tall
and
dark
and
grand
with
a
perfectly
regal
form
and
queenly
air
hair
black
as
midnight
coiled
in
heavy
masses
around
her
head
eyes
blacker
if
possible
than
her
hair
as
to
dress
it
was
very
difficult
to
determine
sometimes
it
was
velvet
and
diamonds
or
if
the
season
would
not
possibly
admit
of
that
then
a
rich
dark
silk
never
by
any
chance
a
material
lighter
than
silk
this
had
been
her
picture
now
she
could
not
suppress
a
laugh
as
she
noted
the
contrast
between
it
and
the
original
she
was
even
two
inches
shorter
than
ester
herself
with
a
manner
much
more
like
a
fairy
than
a
queen
instead
of
heavy
coils
of
black
hair
there
were
little
rings
of
brown
curls
clustering
around
a
fair
pale
forehead
and
continually
peeping
over
into
the
bluest
of
eyes
then
her
dress
was
the
softest
and
quietest
of
muslins
with
a
tint
ester
softly
laugh
chimed
merrily
she
turned
quickly
now
have
you
found
something
to
laugh
at
in
me
already
she
said
gleefully
why
said
ester
forgetting
to
be
startled
over
the
idea
that
she
should
laugh
at
cousin
abbie
i
only
laughing
to
think
how
totally
different
you
are
from
your
picture
from
my
picture
yes
the
one
which
i
had
drawn
of
you
in
my
own
mind
i
thought
you
were
tall
and
had
black
hair
and
dressed
in
silks
like
a
grand
lady
abbie
laughed
again
do
condemn
me
to
silks
in
such
weather
as
this
at
least
she
said
gaily
mother
thinks
i
am
barbarous
to
summon
friends
to
the
city
in
august
but
the
circumstances
are
such
that
it
could
not
well
be
avoided
so
put
on
your
coolest
dress
and
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
this
question
of
how
she
should
appear
on
this
first
evening
had
been
one
of
ester
puzzles
it
would
hardly
do
to
don
her
blue
silk
at
once
and
she
had
almost
decided
to
choose
the
black
one
but
laugh
and
shrug
of
the
shoulder
had
settled
the
question
of
silks
so
now
she
stood
in
confused
indecision
before
her
open
trunk
abbie
came
to
the
rescue
shall
i
help
you
she
said
coming
forward
i
not
ring
for
maggie
but
be
waiting
maid
myself
suppose
i
hang
up
some
of
these
dresses
and
which
shall
i
leave
for
you
this
looks
the
coolest
and
she
held
up
to
ester
view
the
pink
and
white
muslin
which
did
duty
as
an
afternoon
dress
at
home
well
said
ester
with
a
relieved
smile
i
take
that
and
she
thought
within
her
heart
they
are
not
so
grand
after
all
presently
they
went
down
to
dinner
and
in
view
of
the
splendor
of
the
and
sparkle
of
gas
and
the
glitter
of
silver
she
changed
her
mind
again
and
thought
them
very
grand
indeed
her
uncle
greeting
was
very
cordial
and
though
ester
found
it
impossible
to
realize
that
her
aunt
helen
was
actually
three
years
older
than
her
own
mother
or
indeed
that
she
was
a
lady
at
all
so
very
bright
and
gay
and
altogether
unsuitable
did
her
attire
appear
yet
on
the
whole
she
enjoyed
the
first
two
hours
of
her
visit
very
much
and
surprised
and
delighted
herself
at
the
ease
with
which
she
slipped
into
the
many
new
ways
which
she
saw
around
her
only
once
did
she
find
herself
very
much
confused
to
her
great
astonishment
and
dismay
she
was
served
with
a
glass
of
wine
now
ester
among
the
stanch
temperance
friends
with
whom
she
had
hitherto
passed
her
life
had
met
with
no
such
trial
of
her
temperance
principles
which
she
supposed
were
sound
and
strong
yet
here
she
was
at
her
uncle
table
sitting
near
her
aunt
who
was
contentedly
sipping
from
her
glass
would
it
be
proper
under
the
circumstances
to
refuse
yet
would
it
be
proper
to
do
violence
to
her
sense
of
right
ester
had
no
pledge
to
break
except
the
pledge
with
her
own
conscience
and
it
is
most
sadly
true
that
that
sort
of
pledge
does
not
seem
to
be
so
very
binding
in
the
estimation
of
some
people
so
ester
sat
and
toyed
with
hers
and
came
to
the
very
unwarrantable
conclusion
that
what
her
uncle
offered
for
her
entertainment
it
must
be
proper
for
her
to
take
do
ester
good
sense
the
justice
of
understanding
that
she
did
believe
any
such
thing
that
she
knew
it
was
her
own
conscience
by
which
she
was
to
be
judged
not
her
uncle
that
such
arguments
honestly
meant
that
whatever
her
uncle
offered
for
her
entertainment
she
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
refuse
so
she
raised
the
dainty
to
her
lips
and
never
once
bethought
herself
to
look
at
abbie
and
notice
how
the
color
mounted
and
deepened
on
her
face
nor
how
her
glass
remained
untouched
beside
her
plate
on
the
whole
ester
was
glad
when
all
the
bewildering
ceremony
of
the
dinner
was
concluded
and
she
on
the
strength
of
her
being
wearied
with
her
journey
was
permitted
to
retire
with
abbie
to
their
room
chapter
ix
cousin
abbie
now
i
have
you
all
to
myself
that
young
lady
said
with
a
happy
smile
as
she
turned
the
key
on
the
retreating
maggie
and
wheeled
an
ottoman
to
ester
side
where
shall
we
commence
i
have
so
very
much
to
say
and
hear
i
want
to
know
all
about
aunt
laura
and
sadie
and
the
twins
oh
ester
you
have
a
little
brother
are
you
so
glad
he
is
a
boy
why
i
do
know
ester
said
hesitatingly
then
more
decidedly
no
i
am
always
thinking
how
glad
i
should
be
if
he
were
a
young
man
old
enough
to
go
out
with
me
and
be
company
for
me
i
know
that
is
pleasant
but
there
are
very
serious
drawbacks
now
there
our
ralph
it
is
very
pleasant
to
have
him
for
company
and
yet
well
ester
he
is
a
christian
and
it
seems
all
the
time
to
me
that
he
is
walking
on
quicksands
i
am
in
one
continual
tremble
for
him
and
i
wish
so
often
that
he
was
just
a
little
boy
no
older
than
your
brother
alfred
then
i
could
learn
his
tastes
and
indeed
mold
them
in
a
measure
by
having
him
with
me
a
great
deal
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
i
could
make
religion
appear
such
a
pleasant
thing
to
him
that
he
could
help
seeking
jesus
for
himself
do
you
enjoy
teaching
alfred
poor
puzzled
ester
with
what
a
air
her
cousin
asked
this
question
could
she
possibly
tell
her
that
she
sometimes
never
gave
alfred
a
thought
from
one
week
end
to
another
and
that
she
never
in
her
life
thought
of
teaching
him
a
single
thing
i
am
not
his
teacher
she
said
at
length
i
have
no
time
for
any
such
thing
he
goes
to
school
you
know
and
mother
helps
him
well
said
abbie
with
a
thoughtful
air
i
do
quite
mean
teaching
either
at
least
not
lessons
and
things
of
that
sort
though
i
think
i
should
enjoy
having
him
depend
on
me
in
all
his
needs
but
i
was
thinking
more
especially
of
winning
him
to
jesus
it
seems
so
much
easier
to
do
it
while
one
is
young
perhaps
he
is
a
christian
now
is
he
ester
merely
shook
her
head
in
answer
she
could
not
look
in
those
earnest
blue
eyes
and
say
that
she
had
never
by
word
or
act
asked
him
to
come
to
jesus
well
that
is
what
i
mean
you
have
so
much
more
chance
than
i
it
seems
to
me
oh
my
heart
is
so
heavy
for
ralph
i
am
all
alone
ester
do
you
know
that
neither
my
mother
nor
my
father
are
christians
and
our
home
influence
is
well
is
not
what
a
young
man
needs
he
is
very
gay
they
call
it
there
are
his
friends
here
in
the
city
and
his
friends
in
college
none
of
them
the
style
of
people
that
like
him
to
be
with
and
only
poor
little
me
to
stem
the
tide
of
worldliness
all
around
him
there
is
one
thing
in
particular
that
troubles
me
he
is
or
rather
he
is
not
and
here
poor
abbie
stopped
and
a
little
silence
followed
after
a
moment
she
spoke
again
oh
ester
you
will
learn
what
i
mean
without
my
telling
you
it
is
something
in
which
i
greatly
need
your
help
i
depend
upon
you
i
have
looked
forward
to
your
coming
on
his
account
as
well
as
on
my
own
i
know
it
will
be
better
for
him
ester
longed
to
ask
what
the
something
was
and
what
was
expected
of
her
but
the
pained
look
on
abbie
face
deterred
her
and
she
contented
herself
by
saying
where
is
he
now
in
college
coming
next
week
i
long
on
his
account
to
have
a
home
of
my
own
i
believe
i
can
show
him
a
style
of
life
which
will
appear
better
to
him
than
the
one
he
is
leading
now
this
led
to
a
long
talk
on
the
coming
wedding
mother
is
very
much
disturbed
that
it
should
occur
in
august
abbie
said
and
of
course
it
is
not
pleasant
as
it
would
be
later
but
the
trouble
is
foster
is
obliged
to
go
abroad
in
september
who
is
foster
ca
you
be
married
if
he
is
here
not
very
well
abbie
said
with
a
bright
little
laugh
you
see
he
is
the
one
who
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
why
is
he
and
ester
laughed
at
her
former
question
then
as
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
her
she
asked
is
he
a
minister
oh
dear
no
he
is
only
a
merchant
is
he
a
a
christian
was
her
next
query
and
so
utterly
unused
was
she
to
conversation
on
this
subject
that
she
actually
stammered
over
the
simple
sentence
such
a
bright
earnest
face
as
was
turned
toward
her
at
this
question
ester
said
abbie
quickly
i
could
marry
a
man
who
was
not
a
christian
why
ester
asked
startled
a
little
at
the
energy
of
her
tone
do
you
think
it
is
wrong
perhaps
not
for
every
one
i
think
one
own
carefully
enlightened
conscience
should
prayerfully
decide
the
question
but
it
would
be
wrong
for
me
i
am
too
weak
it
would
hinder
my
own
growth
in
grace
i
feel
that
i
need
all
the
human
helps
i
can
get
yes
foster
is
an
earnest
christian
do
you
suppose
said
ester
growing
metaphysical
that
if
foster
were
not
a
christian
you
would
marry
him
a
little
shiver
quivered
through
abbie
frame
as
she
answered
i
hope
i
should
have
strength
to
do
what
i
thought
right
and
i
believe
i
should
yes
you
think
so
now
persisted
ester
because
there
is
no
danger
of
any
such
trial
but
i
tell
you
i
do
believe
if
you
were
brought
to
the
test
that
you
would
do
any
such
thing
abbie
tone
in
reply
was
very
humble
perhaps
not
i
might
miserably
fail
and
yet
ester
has
said
grace
is
sufficient
for
thee
then
after
a
little
silence
the
bright
look
returned
to
her
face
as
she
added
i
am
very
glad
that
i
am
not
to
be
tried
in
that
furnace
and
do
you
know
ester
i
never
believed
in
making
myself
a
martyr
to
what
might
have
been
or
even
what
be
in
the
future
unto
the
day
is
my
motto
if
it
should
ever
be
my
duty
to
burn
at
the
stake
i
believe
i
should
go
to
my
savior
and
plead
for
the
grace
but
as
long
as
i
have
no
such
known
trial
before
me
i
do
know
why
i
should
be
asking
for
what
i
do
not
need
or
grow
unhappy
over
improbabilities
though
i
pray
every
day
to
be
prepared
for
whatever
the
future
has
for
me
then
the
talk
drifted
back
again
to
the
various
details
connected
with
the
wedding
until
suddenly
abbie
came
to
her
feet
with
a
spring
why
ester
she
exclaimed
penitently
what
a
thoughtless
wretch
i
am
here
have
i
been
chattering
you
fairly
into
midnight
without
a
thought
of
your
tired
body
and
brain
this
session
must
adjourn
immediately
shall
you
and
i
have
prayers
together
will
it
seem
homelike
to
you
can
you
play
i
am
sadie
for
just
a
little
while
i
should
like
it
ester
answered
faintly
shall
i
read
as
you
are
so
weary
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
unclasped
the
lids
of
her
little
bible
are
you
reading
the
bible
by
course
where
do
you
like
best
to
read
for
devotional
reading
i
mean
i
do
know
that
i
have
any
choice
ester
voice
was
fainter
still
have
you
i
have
my
special
verses
that
i
turn
to
in
my
various
needs
where
are
you
and
sadie
reading
no
where
said
ester
desperately
abbie
face
expressed
only
innocent
surprise
do
you
read
together
you
are
roommates
are
you
now
i
always
thought
it
would
be
so
delightful
to
have
a
nice
little
time
like
family
worship
in
one
own
room
sadie
does
care
anything
about
these
things
she
is
a
christian
ester
said
at
length
oh
dear
is
she
what
a
very
sad
and
troubled
tone
it
was
in
which
abbie
spoke
then
you
know
something
of
my
anxiety
and
yet
it
is
different
she
is
younger
than
you
and
you
can
have
her
so
much
under
your
influence
at
least
it
seems
different
to
me
how
prone
we
are
to
consider
our
own
anxieties
peculiarly
trying
ester
never
remembered
giving
a
half
hour
anxious
thought
to
this
which
was
supposed
to
be
an
anxiety
with
her
in
all
her
life
but
she
did
not
say
so
and
abbie
continued
who
is
your
particular
christian
friend
then
what
an
exceedingly
trying
and
troublesome
talk
this
was
to
ester
what
she
to
say
clearly
nothing
but
the
truth
abbie
i
have
a
friend
in
the
world
you
poor
dear
child
then
we
are
situated
very
much
alike
after
all
though
i
have
dear
friends
outside
of
my
own
family
but
what
a
heavy
responsibility
you
must
feel
in
your
large
household
and
you
the
only
christian
do
you
shrink
from
responsibility
of
that
kind
ester
does
it
seem
sometimes
as
if
it
would
almost
rush
you
oh
there
are
some
christians
in
the
family
ester
answered
preferring
to
avoid
the
last
part
of
the
sentence
but
then
they
are
half
way
christians
perhaps
i
understand
how
that
is
it
really
seems
sadder
to
me
than
even
thoughtless
neglect
be
it
recorded
that
ester
conscience
pricked
her
this
supposition
on
abbie
part
was
not
true
van
anden
for
instance
always
had
seemed
to
her
most
horribly
and
fanatically
in
earnest
but
in
what
rank
should
she
place
this
young
and
beautiful
and
wealthy
city
lady
surely
she
could
not
be
a
fanatic
ester
was
troubled
well
said
abbie
suppose
i
read
you
some
of
my
sweet
verses
do
you
know
i
always
feel
a
temptation
to
read
in
john
there
is
so
much
in
that
book
about
jesus
and
john
seemed
to
love
him
so
ester
almost
laughed
what
an
exceedingly
queer
idea
a
to
read
in
any
part
of
the
bible
what
a
strange
girl
her
cousin
was
now
the
reading
began
this
is
my
verse
when
i
am
discouraged
on
the
lord
be
of
good
courage
and
he
shall
strengthen
thine
heart
wait
i
say
on
the
lord
is
that
reassuring
and
then
these
two
oh
ester
these
are
wonderful
have
blotted
out
as
a
thick
cloud
thy
transgressions
and
as
a
cloud
thy
sins
return
unto
me
for
i
have
redeemed
thee
o
ye
heavens
for
the
lord
hath
done
it
shout
ye
lower
parts
of
the
earth
break
forth
in
singing
ye
mountains
o
forest
and
every
tree
therein
for
the
lord
hath
redeemed
jacob
and
glorified
himself
in
israel
and
in
that
glorious
old
prophet
book
is
my
jubilant
verse
the
ransomed
of
the
lord
shall
return
and
come
to
zion
with
songs
and
everlasting
joy
upon
their
heads
they
shall
obtain
joy
and
gladness
and
sorrow
and
sighing
shall
flee
away
now
ester
you
are
very
tired
are
you
and
i
keep
dipping
into
my
treasure
like
a
thoughtless
selfish
girl
as
i
am
you
and
i
will
have
some
precious
readings
out
of
this
book
shall
we
not
now
read
you
my
sweet
psalm
do
you
think
the
psalms
are
wonderful
ester
and
without
waiting
for
reply
the
musical
voice
read
on
through
that
marvel
of
simplicity
and
grandeur
the
psalm
i
will
lift
up
mine
eyes
unto
the
hills
from
whence
cometh
my
help
my
help
cometh
from
the
lord
which
made
heaven
and
earth
he
will
not
suffer
thy
foot
to
be
moved
he
that
keepeth
thee
will
not
slumber
behold
he
that
keepeth
israel
shall
neither
slumber
nor
sleep
the
lord
is
thy
keeper
the
lord
is
thy
shade
upon
thy
right
hand
the
sun
shall
not
smite
thee
by
day
nor
the
moon
by
night
the
lord
shall
preserve
thee
from
all
evil
he
shall
preserve
thy
soul
the
lord
shall
preserve
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
from
this
time
forth
and
even
for
evermore
ester
will
you
pray
questioned
her
cousin
as
the
reading
ceased
and
she
softly
closed
her
tiny
book
ester
gave
her
head
a
nervous
hurried
shake
then
shall
i
or
dear
ester
would
you
prefer
to
be
alone
no
said
ester
i
should
like
to
hear
you
and
so
they
knelt
and
abbie
simple
earnest
tender
prayer
ester
carried
with
her
for
many
a
day
after
both
heads
were
resting
on
their
pillows
and
quiet
reigned
in
the
room
ester
eyes
were
wide
open
her
cousin
abbie
had
astonished
her
she
was
totally
unlike
the
cousin
abbie
of
her
dreams
in
every
particular
in
nothing
more
so
than
the
strangely
childlike
way
in
which
she
talked
about
this
matter
of
religion
ester
had
never
in
her
life
heard
any
one
talk
like
that
except
perhaps
that
minister
who
had
spoken
to
her
in
the
depot
his
religion
seemed
not
unlike
abbie
thinking
of
him
she
suddenly
addressed
abbie
again
there
was
a
minister
in
the
depot
and
he
spoke
to
me
then
the
entire
story
of
the
man
with
his
tract
and
the
girl
with
blue
ribbons
and
the
old
lady
and
the
young
minister
and
bits
of
the
conversation
were
gone
over
for
abbie
benefit
and
abbie
listened
and
commented
and
enjoyed
every
word
of
it
until
the
little
clock
on
the
mantel
spoke
in
silver
tones
and
said
one
two
then
abbie
grew
penitent
again
positively
ester
i
wo
speak
again
you
will
be
sleepy
all
day
and
you
need
think
i
shall
give
you
a
chance
even
to
wink
repeated
ester
but
she
still
kept
her
eyes
wide
open
her
journey
and
her
arrival
and
abbie
and
the
newness
and
strangeness
of
everything
around
her
had
banished
all
thought
of
sleep
so
she
went
over
in
detail
everything
which
had
occurred
that
day
but
persistently
her
thoughts
returned
to
the
question
which
had
so
startled
her
coming
from
the
lips
of
a
stranger
and
to
the
singleness
of
heart
which
seemed
to
possess
her
cousin
abbie
she
a
after
all
she
queried
if
so
what
caused
the
difference
between
abbie
and
herself
it
was
but
a
few
hours
since
she
first
beheld
her
cousin
and
yet
she
distinctly
the
difference
between
them
in
that
matter
we
are
as
unlike
thought
ester
turning
restlessly
on
her
pillow
well
as
unlike
as
two
people
can
be
what
abbie
say
could
she
know
that
it
was
actually
months
since
ester
had
read
as
much
connectedly
in
her
bible
as
she
had
heard
read
that
evening
yes
ester
had
gone
backward
even
as
far
as
that
farther
what
would
abbie
say
to
the
fact
that
there
were
many
many
prayerless
days
in
her
life
not
very
many
perhaps
in
which
she
had
not
used
a
form
of
prayer
but
their
names
were
legion
in
which
she
had
risen
from
her
knees
unhelped
and
unrefreshed
in
which
she
knew
that
she
had
not
a
single
one
of
the
sentences
which
she
had
been
repeating
and
just
at
this
point
she
was
stunned
with
a
sudden
thought
a
thought
which
too
often
escapes
us
all
she
would
not
for
the
world
it
seemed
to
her
have
made
known
to
abbie
just
how
matters
stood
with
her
and
yet
and
yet
christ
knew
it
all
she
lay
very
still
and
breathed
heavily
it
came
to
her
with
all
the
thrill
of
an
entirely
new
idea
then
that
unwearied
and
satan
came
to
her
aid
oh
well
said
he
your
cousin
abbie
surroundings
are
very
different
from
yours
give
you
all
the
time
which
she
has
at
her
disposal
and
i
dare
say
you
would
be
quite
as
familiar
with
your
bible
as
she
is
with
hers
what
does
she
know
about
the
petty
vexations
and
temptations
and
bewildering
duties
which
every
hour
of
every
day
beset
your
path
the
circumstances
are
very
different
her
life
is
in
the
sunshine
yours
in
the
shadow
besides
you
do
not
know
her
it
is
easy
enough
to
talk
easy
to
read
a
chapter
in
the
bible
but
after
all
there
are
other
things
quite
as
important
and
it
is
more
than
likely
that
your
cousin
is
not
quite
perfect
yet
ester
did
not
know
that
this
was
the
soothing
lullaby
of
the
old
serpent
well
for
her
if
she
had
and
had
answered
it
with
that
solemn
get
thee
behind
me
satan
but
she
gave
her
own
poor
brain
the
benefit
of
every
thought
and
having
thus
lulled
and
patted
and
coaxed
her
and
startled
conscience
into
quiet
rest
again
she
turned
on
her
pillow
and
went
to
sleep
chapter
ester
minister
ester
was
dreaming
that
the
old
lady
on
the
cars
had
become
a
fairy
and
that
her
voice
sounded
like
a
silver
bell
when
she
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
and
found
that
it
was
either
the
voice
of
the
marble
clock
on
the
mantel
or
of
her
cousin
abbie
who
was
bending
over
her
do
you
feel
able
to
get
up
to
breakfast
ester
dear
or
had
you
rather
lie
and
rest
breakfast
echoed
ester
in
a
sleepy
bewilderment
raising
herself
on
one
elbow
and
gazing
at
her
cousin
yes
breakfast
this
with
a
merry
laugh
did
you
suppose
that
people
in
new
york
lived
without
such
inconveniences
oh
to
be
sure
she
was
in
new
york
and
ester
repeated
the
laugh
it
had
sounded
so
queerly
to
hear
any
one
talk
to
her
about
getting
up
to
breakfast
it
had
not
seemed
possible
that
that
meal
could
be
prepared
without
her
assistance
yes
certainly
i
get
up
at
once
have
i
kept
you
waiting
abbie
oh
no
not
at
all
generally
we
breakfast
at
nine
but
mother
gave
orders
last
night
to
delay
until
nine
this
morning
ester
turned
to
the
little
clock
in
great
amazement
it
was
actually
ten
minutes
to
nine
what
an
idea
she
never
remembered
sleeping
so
late
in
her
life
before
why
at
home
the
work
in
the
and
kitchen
must
all
be
done
by
this
time
and
sadie
was
probably
making
beds
poor
sadie
what
a
time
she
would
have
she
will
learn
a
little
about
life
while
i
am
away
thought
ester
complacently
as
she
stood
before
the
mirror
and
pinned
the
dainty
frill
on
her
new
pink
cambric
wrapper
which
sadie
deft
fingers
had
fashioned
for
her
ester
had
declined
the
assistance
of
maggie
feeling
that
though
she
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
make
her
own
toilet
she
did
know
how
to
receive
assistance
in
the
matter
now
i
will
leave
you
for
a
little
abbie
said
taking
up
her
tiny
bible
ester
where
is
your
bible
i
suppose
you
have
it
with
you
ester
looked
annoyed
i
do
believe
i
have
she
said
hurriedly
i
packed
in
such
haste
you
see
and
i
do
remember
putting
it
in
at
all
oh
i
am
sorry
you
will
miss
it
so
much
do
you
have
a
thousand
little
private
marks
in
your
bible
that
nobody
else
understands
i
have
a
great
habit
of
reading
in
that
way
well
i
bring
you
one
from
the
library
that
you
may
mark
just
as
much
as
you
please
ester
sat
herself
down
with
a
very
complacent
air
beside
the
open
window
with
the
bible
which
had
just
been
brought
her
in
her
lap
clearly
she
had
been
left
alone
that
she
might
have
opportunity
for
private
devotion
and
she
liked
the
idea
very
much
to
be
sure
she
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
in
the
bible
in
the
morning
but
that
she
told
herself
was
simply
because
she
never
had
time
hardly
to
breathe
in
the
mornings
at
home
there
she
had
beefsteak
to
cook
and
breakfast
rolls
to
attend
to
she
said
disdainfully
as
if
beefsteak
and
breakfast
rolls
were
the
most
contemptible
articles
in
the
world
entirely
beneath
the
notice
of
a
rational
being
but
now
she
was
in
a
very
different
atmosphere
and
at
nine
of
a
summer
morning
was
attired
in
a
very
becoming
pink
wrapper
finished
with
the
whitest
of
frills
and
sat
at
her
window
a
young
lady
of
elegant
leisure
waiting
for
the
of
course
she
could
read
a
chapter
in
the
bible
now
and
should
enjoy
it
quite
as
much
as
abbie
did
she
had
never
learned
that
happy
little
habit
of
having
a
bible
for
her
own
personal
and
private
use
full
of
pencil
marks
and
sacred
meanings
grown
dear
from
association
and
teeming
with
memories
of
precious
communings
she
had
one
of
course
a
nice
bible
and
if
it
chanced
to
be
convenient
when
she
was
ready
to
read
she
used
it
if
not
she
took
sadie
or
picked
up
julia
from
under
the
table
or
the
old
one
on
a
shelf
in
the
corner
with
one
cover
and
part
of
revelation
missing
it
mattered
not
one
whit
to
her
which
for
there
were
no
pencil
marks
and
no
leaves
turned
down
and
no
special
verses
to
find
she
thought
the
idea
of
marking
certain
verses
an
excellent
one
and
deciding
to
commence
doing
so
at
once
cast
about
her
for
a
pencil
there
was
one
on
the
round
table
by
the
other
window
but
there
were
also
many
other
things
abbie
watch
lay
ticking
softly
in
its
marble
and
velvet
bed
and
had
to
be
examined
and
sighed
over
and
abbie
diamond
pin
in
the
also
demanded
attention
then
there
were
some
blue
and
gold
volumes
to
be
peeped
at
and
longfellow
received
more
than
a
peep
then
most
witching
of
all
say
and
seal
in
two
volumes
the
very
books
sadie
had
borrowed
once
and
returned
before
ester
had
a
chance
to
discover
how
faith
managed
about
the
ring
longfellow
and
the
bible
slid
on
the
table
together
and
say
and
seal
was
eagerly
seized
upon
just
to
be
glanced
over
and
the
glances
continued
until
there
pealed
a
bell
through
the
house
and
with
a
start
and
a
confused
sense
of
having
neglected
her
opportunities
this
christian
young
lady
followed
her
cousin
down
stairs
to
meet
all
the
temptations
and
bewilderments
of
a
new
day
unstrengthened
by
communion
with
either
her
bible
or
her
savior
that
breakfast
in
all
its
details
was
a
most
bewitching
affair
ester
felt
that
she
could
never
enjoy
that
meal
again
at
a
table
that
was
not
small
and
round
and
covered
with
damask
nor
drink
coffee
that
had
not
first
flowed
gracefully
down
from
a
silver
urn
as
for
aunt
helen
she
could
have
dispensed
with
her
she
even
caught
herself
drawing
unfavorable
comparisons
between
her
and
the
patient
hardworking
mother
far
away
where
is
uncle
ralph
she
asked
suddenly
becoming
conscious
that
there
were
only
three
when
last
evening
there
were
four
gone
down
town
some
hours
ago
abbie
answered
he
is
a
you
know
and
can
not
keep
such
late
hours
but
does
he
go
without
breakfast
no
takes
it
at
seven
instead
of
nine
like
our
lazy
selves
he
used
to
breakfast
at
a
restaurant
down
town
like
other
further
explained
aunt
helen
observing
the
bewildered
look
of
this
novice
in
but
it
is
one
of
abbie
recent
whims
that
she
can
make
him
more
comfortable
at
home
so
they
rehearse
the
interesting
scene
of
breakfast
by
every
morning
abbie
clear
laugh
rang
out
merrily
at
this
my
dear
mother
do
i
beg
of
you
insult
the
sun
in
that
manner
ester
fancy
at
seven
on
an
august
morning
do
you
get
down
stairs
at
seven
was
ester
only
reply
yes
at
six
or
at
most
you
see
if
i
am
to
make
father
as
comfortable
at
home
as
he
would
be
at
a
restaurant
i
must
flutter
around
a
little
burns
her
cheeks
and
her
fingers
over
the
stove
continued
aunt
helen
in
a
disgusted
tone
in
order
that
her
father
may
have
burnt
toast
prepared
by
her
hands
you
blundered
in
one
item
mother
was
abbie
reply
my
toast
is
burnt
and
only
this
morning
father
pronounced
it
perfect
oh
she
is
developing
answered
ried
with
a
curious
mixture
of
annoyance
and
amusement
in
look
and
tone
if
foster
fails
in
business
soon
as
i
presume
he
will
judging
from
his
present
rate
of
proceeding
we
shall
find
her
advertising
for
the
position
of
cook
in
a
small
family
if
abbie
felt
wounded
or
vexed
over
this
thrust
at
foster
it
showed
itself
only
by
a
slight
deepening
of
the
pink
on
her
cheek
as
she
answered
in
the
brightest
of
tones
if
i
do
mother
and
you
engage
me
i
promise
you
that
the
eggs
shall
not
be
boiled
as
hard
as
these
are
all
this
impressed
two
thoughts
on
ester
mind
one
that
abbie
for
some
great
reason
unknown
to
and
unimagined
by
herself
actually
of
her
own
free
will
arose
early
every
morning
and
busied
herself
over
preparations
for
her
father
breakfast
the
other
that
mother
said
some
disagreeable
things
to
her
in
a
disagreeable
way
a
way
that
would
exceedingly
provoke
and
that
she
she
said
to
herself
with
energy
these
two
thoughts
so
impressed
themselves
that
when
she
and
abbie
were
alone
again
they
led
her
to
ask
two
questions
why
do
you
get
breakfast
at
home
for
your
father
abbie
is
it
necessary
no
only
i
like
it
and
he
likes
it
you
see
he
has
very
little
time
to
spend
at
home
and
i
like
that
little
to
be
homelike
besides
ester
it
is
my
one
hour
of
opportunity
with
my
father
i
almost
see
him
alone
at
any
other
time
and
i
am
constantly
praying
that
the
spirit
will
make
use
of
some
little
word
or
act
of
mine
to
lead
him
to
the
cross
there
was
no
reply
to
be
made
to
this
so
ester
turned
to
the
other
question
what
does
your
mother
mean
by
her
reference
to
mr
foster
she
thinks
some
of
his
schemes
of
benevolence
are
on
too
large
a
scale
to
be
prudent
but
he
is
a
very
prudent
man
and
does
seem
to
think
so
at
all
does
it
annoy
you
to
have
her
speak
in
that
manner
about
him
the
color
flushed
into
abbie
cheeks
again
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
answered
gently
i
think
it
would
ester
if
she
were
not
my
you
know
another
rebuke
ester
felt
vexed
anyway
this
new
strange
cousin
of
hers
was
going
to
prove
painfully
good
but
her
first
day
in
new
york
despite
the
strangeness
of
everything
was
full
of
delight
to
her
they
did
not
go
out
as
ester
was
supposed
to
be
wearied
from
her
journey
though
in
reality
she
never
felt
better
and
she
reveled
all
day
in
a
sense
of
freedom
of
doing
exactly
what
she
pleased
and
indeed
of
doing
nothing
this
last
was
an
experience
so
new
and
strange
to
her
that
it
seemed
delightful
ester
round
of
home
duties
had
been
so
constant
and
pressing
the
rebound
was
extreme
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
never
bake
any
more
pies
and
cakes
in
that
great
oven
and
she
actually
shuddered
over
the
thought
that
if
she
were
at
home
she
would
probably
be
engaged
in
ironing
while
maggie
did
the
heavier
work
she
went
to
fanning
most
vigorously
as
this
occurred
to
her
and
sank
back
among
the
luxurious
cushions
of
abbie
easy
chair
as
if
exhausted
then
she
pitied
herself
most
industriously
and
envied
abbie
more
than
ever
and
gave
no
thought
at
all
to
mother
and
sadie
who
were
working
so
much
harder
than
usual
in
order
that
she
might
sit
here
at
ease
at
last
she
decided
to
dismiss
every
one
of
these
uncomfortable
thoughts
to
forget
that
she
had
ever
spent
an
hour
of
her
life
in
a
miserable
hot
kitchen
but
to
give
herself
entirely
and
unreservedly
to
the
charmed
life
which
stretched
out
before
her
for
three
beautiful
weeks
three
weeks
is
quite
a
little
time
after
all
she
told
herself
hopefully
three
weeks
ago
i
had
the
least
idea
of
being
here
and
who
knows
what
may
happen
in
the
next
three
weeks
ah
sure
enough
ester
who
knows
when
am
i
to
see
mr
foster
she
inquired
of
abbie
as
they
came
up
together
from
the
after
lunch
why
you
will
see
him
if
you
are
not
too
tired
to
go
out
with
me
i
was
going
to
ask
about
that
i
ready
for
anything
do
feel
as
if
i
ever
experienced
the
meaning
of
that
word
said
ester
briskly
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
going
anywhere
well
then
i
shall
carry
you
off
to
our
thursday
evening
it
just
meeting
you
see
we
teachers
in
the
mission
there
are
fifty
of
us
and
we
do
have
the
most
delightful
times
it
is
like
a
family
rather
a
large
family
perhaps
you
think
but
it
does
seem
so
when
we
come
on
sabbath
from
the
great
congregation
and
gather
in
our
dear
little
chapel
we
seem
like
a
company
of
brothers
and
sisters
shutting
ourselves
in
at
home
to
talk
and
pray
together
for
a
little
before
we
go
out
into
the
world
again
is
thursday
your
regular
evening
ester
now
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
for
ester
to
tell
when
regular
evening
was
as
it
was
so
long
ago
that
she
grew
out
of
the
habit
of
regularly
attending
that
now
she
scarcely
ever
gave
it
a
thought
but
she
had
sufficient
conscience
left
to
be
ashamed
of
this
state
of
things
and
to
understand
that
abbie
referred
to
the
church
so
she
answered
simply
no
wednesday
that
is
our
church
night
i
missed
it
last
evening
because
i
wanted
to
welcome
you
and
tuesday
is
our
night
do
you
give
three
evenings
a
week
to
religious
meetings
abbie
yes
said
abbie
with
softly
glee
is
it
splendid
i
appreciate
my
privileges
i
assure
you
so
many
people
do
it
and
so
many
people
ester
thought
so
they
were
not
in
to
dinner
with
the
family
but
took
theirs
an
hour
earlier
and
with
david
whom
abbie
called
her
for
escort
made
their
way
to
abbie
dear
little
chapel
which
proved
to
be
a
church
very
prettily
finished
and
furnished
that
meeting
from
first
to
last
was
a
succession
of
surprises
to
ester
commencing
with
the
leader
and
being
announced
to
abbie
in
undertone
your
minister
is
the
very
man
who
spoke
to
me
yesterday
in
the
depot
abbie
nodded
and
smiled
her
surprise
at
this
information
and
ester
looked
about
her
presently
another
whisper
why
abbie
there
is
the
girl
i
told
you
about
sitting
in
the
third
seat
from
the
front
that
said
abbie
looking
and
whispering
back
is
fanny
ames
one
of
our
teachers
presently
ester
set
to
work
to
select
foster
from
the
rows
of
young
men
who
were
rapidly
filling
the
front
seats
in
the
left
aisle
i
believe
that
one
in
glasses
and
brown
kids
is
he
she
said
to
herself
regarding
him
curiously
and
as
if
to
reward
her
penetration
he
rose
suddenly
and
came
over
book
in
hand
to
the
seat
directly
in
front
of
where
they
were
sitting
good
evening
abbie
was
his
greeting
we
want
to
sing
this
hymn
and
have
not
the
tune
can
you
lead
it
without
the
notes
why
yes
answered
abbie
slowly
and
with
a
little
hesitation
that
is
if
you
will
help
me
we
all
help
he
said
smiling
and
returning
to
his
seat
yes
i
sure
that
is
he
commented
ester
then
the
meeting
commenced
it
was
a
novel
one
one
person
at
least
had
never
attended
any
just
like
it
instead
of
the
chapter
of
proper
length
which
ester
thought
all
ministers
selected
for
public
reading
this
reader
read
just
three
verses
and
he
did
not
even
rise
from
his
seat
to
do
it
nor
use
the
pulpit
bible
but
read
from
a
bit
of
a
book
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
then
the
man
in
spectacles
started
a
hymn
which
ester
judged
was
the
one
which
had
no
notes
attached
from
the
prompt
manner
in
which
abbie
took
up
the
very
first
word
now
said
the
leader
briskly
before
we
pray
let
us
have
requests
and
almost
before
he
had
concluded
the
sentence
a
young
man
responded
remember
especially
a
boy
in
my
class
who
seems
disposed
to
turn
every
serious
word
into
ridicule
what
a
queer
subject
for
prayer
ester
thought
remember
my
little
brother
who
is
thinking
earnestly
of
those
things
another
gentleman
said
speaking
quickly
as
if
he
realized
that
he
must
hasten
or
lose
his
chance
pray
for
every
one
of
my
class
i
want
them
all
and
at
this
esther
actually
started
for
the
petition
came
from
the
lips
of
the
fanny
in
the
corner
a
lady
actually
taking
part
in
a
when
gentlemen
were
present
how
very
improper
she
glanced
around
her
nervously
but
no
one
else
seemed
in
the
least
surprised
or
disturbed
and
indeed
another
young
lady
immediately
followed
her
with
a
similar
request
now
said
the
leader
let
us
pray
and
that
prayer
was
so
strange
in
its
sounding
to
ester
it
did
not
commence
by
reminding
god
that
he
was
the
maker
and
ruler
of
the
universe
or
that
he
was
omnipotent
and
omnipresent
and
eternal
or
any
of
the
solemn
forms
of
prayer
to
which
her
ears
were
used
but
simply
oh
dear
savior
receive
these
petitions
which
we
bring
turn
to
thyself
the
heart
of
the
lad
who
ridicules
the
efforts
of
his
teacher
lead
the
little
brother
into
the
strait
and
narrow
way
gather
that
entire
class
into
thy
heart
of
love
and
thus
for
each
separate
request
a
separate
petition
and
as
the
meeting
progressed
it
grew
more
strange
every
moment
to
ester
each
one
seemed
to
have
a
word
that
he
was
eager
to
utter
and
the
prayers
while
very
brief
were
so
pointed
as
to
be
almost
startling
they
sang
too
a
great
deal
only
a
verse
at
a
time
and
whenever
they
seemed
to
feel
like
it
her
amazement
reached
its
hight
when
she
felt
a
little
rustle
beside
her
and
turned
in
time
to
see
the
eager
light
in
abbie
eyes
as
she
said
one
of
my
class
has
decided
for
christ
good
news
responded
the
leader
do
let
us
forget
this
item
of
thanksgiving
when
we
pray
as
for
ester
she
was
almost
inclined
not
to
believe
her
ears
had
her
cousin
abbie
actually
spoken
in
meeting
she
was
about
to
sink
into
a
reverie
over
this
but
had
time
for
at
this
point
the
leader
arose
i
am
sorry
said
he
to
cut
the
thread
that
binds
us
but
the
hour
is
gone
another
week
will
soon
pass
though
and
god
willing
we
shall
take
up
the
story
sing
and
a
soft
sweet
chant
stole
through
the
room
let
my
prayer
be
set
forth
before
thee
as
incense
and
the
lifting
of
my
hands
as
evening
sacrifice
then
the
little
company
moved
with
a
quiet
cheerfulness
toward
the
door
have
you
enjoyed
the
evening
abbie
asked
in
an
eager
tone
as
they
passed
down
the
aisle
why
yes
i
believe
so
only
it
was
rather
queer
queer
was
it
how
oh
i
tell
you
when
we
get
home
your
minister
is
exactly
behind
us
abbie
and
i
guess
he
wants
to
speak
with
you
there
was
a
bright
flush
on
abbie
face
and
a
little
sparkle
in
her
eye
as
she
turned
and
gave
her
hand
to
the
minister
and
then
said
in
a
demure
and
softly
tone
cousin
ester
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
my
friend
mr
foster
chapter
xi
the
new
boarder
i
do
know
what
to
decide
really
ried
said
thoughtfully
standing
with
an
irresolute
air
beside
the
pantry
door
sadie
had
i
better
make
these
pies
is
that
the
momentous
question
which
you
ca
decide
mother
ried
laughed
not
quite
it
is
about
the
new
boarder
we
have
room
enough
for
another
certainly
and
seven
dollars
a
week
is
quite
an
item
just
now
if
ester
were
at
home
i
should
hesitate
mother
if
i
were
the
meekest
and
most
enduring
of
mortals
i
should
be
hopelessly
vexed
by
this
time
at
the
constancy
with
which
your
thoughts
turn
to
ester
it
is
positively
insulting
as
if
i
were
not
doing
remarkably
do
you
put
anything
else
in
i
never
mean
to
have
one
by
the
way
in
my
house
i
think
they
horrid
crust
apples
nutmeg
little
lumps
of
butter
all
over
it
is
there
anything
else
mother
before
i
put
the
top
on
sometimes
i
sweeten
mine
a
little
ried
answered
demurely
oh
sure
enough
it
was
that
new
boarder
that
took
all
thoughts
of
sweetness
out
of
me
how
much
sugar
mother
do
let
him
come
we
are
such
a
stupid
family
now
it
is
time
we
had
a
new
element
in
it
besides
you
know
i
broke
the
largest
platter
yesterday
and
his
seven
dollars
will
help
buy
another
i
wish
he
was
anything
but
a
doctor
though
one
ingredient
of
that
kind
is
enough
in
a
family
especially
of
the
stamp
which
we
have
at
present
sadie
said
ried
gravely
and
reprovingly
i
never
knew
a
young
man
for
whom
i
have
a
greater
respect
than
i
have
for
van
anden
yes
answered
sadie
with
equal
gravity
i
have
an
immense
respect
for
him
i
assure
you
and
so
i
have
for
the
president
and
i
feel
about
as
intimate
with
the
one
as
the
other
i
hope
douglass
will
be
delightfully
wild
and
wicked
how
will
van
anden
enjoy
the
idea
of
a
rival
i
spoke
of
it
to
him
yesterday
i
told
him
we
give
the
matter
another
thought
if
it
would
be
in
any
way
unpleasant
to
him
i
thought
we
owed
him
that
consideration
in
return
for
all
his
kindness
to
us
but
he
assured
me
that
it
could
make
not
the
slightest
difference
to
him
do
let
him
come
then
i
believe
i
need
another
bed
to
make
growing
thin
for
want
of
exercise
and
by
the
way
that
suggests
an
item
in
his
favor
being
a
doctor
he
will
be
out
all
night
occasionally
perhaps
and
the
bed
wo
need
making
so
often
mother
i
do
believe
i
did
put
a
speck
of
soda
in
that
cake
i
made
this
morning
what
will
that
do
to
it
or
more
properly
speaking
what
will
it
do
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
there
to
as
for
ester
i
shall
consider
it
a
personal
insult
if
you
refer
to
her
again
when
i
am
so
magnificently
filling
her
place
and
this
much
enduring
mother
laughed
and
groaned
at
nearly
the
same
time
poor
ester
never
forgot
the
soda
nor
indeed
anything
else
in
her
life
but
then
sadie
was
so
overflowing
with
sparkle
and
good
humor
finally
the
question
was
decided
and
the
new
boarder
came
and
was
duly
installed
in
the
family
and
thence
commenced
a
new
era
in
sadie
life
merry
clerks
and
schoolboys
she
counted
among
her
acquaintances
by
the
score
grave
dignified
slightly
taciturn
men
of
the
van
anden
stamp
she
numbered
also
among
her
friends
but
never
one
quite
like
douglass
this
easy
graceful
courteous
gentleman
who
seemed
always
to
have
just
the
right
thing
to
say
or
do
at
just
the
right
moment
who
was
neither
wild
nor
sober
who
seemed
the
furthest
possible
remove
from
wicked
yet
who
was
never
by
any
chance
disagreeably
good
his
acquaintance
with
sadie
progressed
rapidly
a
new
element
had
come
to
mix
in
with
her
life
the
golden
days
wherein
the
two
sisters
had
been
much
together
wherein
the
christian
sister
might
have
planted
much
seed
for
the
master
in
sadie
bright
young
heart
had
all
gone
by
perchance
that
sleeping
christian
nestled
so
cosily
among
the
cushions
in
cousin
abbie
might
have
been
startled
and
aroused
could
she
have
realized
that
days
like
those
would
never
come
back
to
her
that
being
misspent
they
had
passed
away
that
a
new
worker
had
come
to
drop
seed
into
the
unoccupied
heart
that
never
again
would
sadie
be
as
fresh
and
as
guileless
and
as
easily
won
as
in
those
days
which
she
had
let
slip
in
idle
aye
worse
than
idle
slumber
sadie
sealed
and
directed
a
letter
to
ester
and
ran
with
it
down
stairs
douglass
stood
in
the
doorway
hat
in
hand
shall
i
have
the
pleasure
of
being
your
carrier
he
said
courteously
do
you
suppose
you
are
to
be
trusted
sadie
questioned
as
she
quietly
deposited
the
letter
in
his
hat
that
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
whether
you
repose
trust
in
me
the
world
is
safer
in
general
than
we
are
inclined
to
think
it
who
lives
in
that
little
birdsnest
of
a
cottage
just
across
the
way
a
dear
old
gentleman
vane
sadie
answered
her
voice
taking
a
tender
tone
as
it
always
did
when
any
chance
word
reminded
her
of
florence
that
is
he
standing
in
the
gateway
does
he
look
like
a
grand
old
patriarch
as
they
looked
van
anden
drove
suddenly
from
around
the
corner
and
reined
in
his
horses
in
front
of
the
opposite
gateway
they
could
hear
his
words
distinctly
vane
let
me
advise
you
to
avoid
this
evening
breeze
it
is
blowing
up
strongly
from
the
river
is
van
anden
the
old
gentleman
nurse
or
guardian
or
what
questioned
sadie
companion
physician
was
her
brief
reply
then
after
a
moment
she
laughed
mischievously
you
do
like
van
anden
dr
douglass
i
oh
yes
i
like
him
the
trouble
is
he
does
like
me
for
which
he
is
not
to
blame
to
be
sure
probably
he
can
not
help
it
i
have
in
some
way
succeeded
in
gaining
his
why
do
you
think
i
am
not
one
of
his
admirers
oh
answered
this
rude
and
lawless
girl
i
thought
it
would
be
very
natural
for
you
to
be
slightly
jealous
of
him
professionally
you
know
if
her
object
was
to
embarrass
or
annoy
douglass
apparently
she
did
not
gain
her
point
he
laughed
good
humoredly
as
he
replied
professionally
he
is
certainly
worthy
of
envy
i
regard
him
as
a
very
skillful
physician
miss
ried
ere
sadie
could
reply
the
horses
were
stopped
before
the
door
and
van
anden
addressed
her
sadie
do
you
want
to
take
a
ride
now
although
sadie
had
no
special
interest
in
or
friendship
for
van
anden
she
did
exceedingly
like
his
horses
and
cultivated
their
acquaintance
whenever
she
had
an
opportunity
so
within
five
minutes
after
this
invitation
was
received
she
was
skimming
over
the
road
in
a
high
state
of
glee
sadie
marked
that
night
afterward
as
the
last
one
in
which
she
rode
after
those
black
ponies
for
many
a
day
the
doctor
seemed
more
at
leisure
than
usual
and
in
a
much
more
talkative
mood
so
it
was
quite
a
merry
ride
until
he
broke
a
moment
silence
by
an
abrupt
question
sadie
have
your
mother
and
you
always
considered
me
a
sincere
friend
to
your
family
sadie
reply
was
prompt
and
to
the
point
certainly
van
anden
i
assure
you
i
have
as
much
respect
for
and
confidence
in
you
as
i
should
have
had
for
my
grandfather
if
i
had
ever
known
him
that
being
the
case
continued
the
doctor
gravely
you
will
give
me
credit
for
sincerity
and
earnestness
in
what
i
am
about
to
say
i
want
to
give
you
a
word
of
warning
concerning
douglass
he
is
not
a
man
whom
can
respect
not
a
man
with
whom
i
should
like
to
see
my
sister
on
terms
of
friendship
i
have
known
him
well
and
long
sadie
therefore
i
speak
sadie
ried
was
never
fretful
never
petulant
and
very
rarely
angry
but
when
she
was
it
was
a
genuine
case
of
unrestrained
rage
and
woe
to
the
individual
who
fell
a
victim
to
her
blazing
eyes
and
sarcastic
tongue
van
anden
was
that
victim
what
right
had
he
to
arraign
her
before
him
and
say
with
whom
she
should
or
should
not
associate
as
if
he
were
indeed
her
very
grandfather
what
business
had
he
to
think
that
she
was
too
friendly
with
douglass
with
the
usual
honesty
belonging
to
very
angry
people
it
had
not
once
occurred
to
her
that
van
anden
had
said
and
done
none
of
these
things
when
she
felt
that
her
voice
was
sufficiently
steady
she
spoke
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
reassure
you
van
anden
you
are
kind
extremely
so
but
as
yet
i
really
feel
myself
in
no
danger
from
douglass
fascinations
however
remarkable
they
may
be
my
mother
and
i
enjoy
excellent
health
at
present
so
you
need
have
no
anxiety
as
regards
our
choice
of
physicians
although
it
is
but
natural
that
you
should
feel
nervous
perhaps
but
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
that
i
consider
your
interference
with
my
affairs
unwarrantable
and
uncalled
for
if
van
anden
desired
to
reply
to
this
insulting
harangue
there
was
no
opportunity
for
at
this
moment
they
whirled
around
the
corner
and
were
at
home
sadie
flung
aside
her
hat
with
an
angry
vehemence
and
seating
herself
at
the
piano
literally
stormed
the
keys
while
the
doctor
his
carriage
and
quietly
proceeded
to
his
evening
round
of
calls
what
a
whirlwind
of
rage
there
was
in
sadie
heart
what
earthly
right
had
this
man
whom
she
to
give
advice
was
she
a
child
to
be
commanded
by
any
one
what
right
had
any
one
to
speak
in
that
way
of
douglass
he
was
a
gentleman
much
more
of
a
one
than
van
anden
had
shown
himself
to
be
and
she
liked
him
yes
and
she
would
like
him
in
spite
of
a
whole
legion
of
envious
doctors
a
light
step
crossed
the
hall
and
entered
the
parlor
sadie
merely
raised
her
eyes
long
enough
to
be
certain
that
douglass
stood
beside
her
and
continued
her
playing
he
leaned
over
the
piano
and
listened
had
you
a
pleasant
ride
he
asked
as
the
tone
of
the
music
lulled
a
little
charming
sadie
voice
was
full
of
emphasis
and
sarcasm
i
judged
by
the
style
of
music
which
you
were
playing
that
there
must
have
been
a
hurricane
nothing
of
the
sort
only
a
little
paternal
advice
indeed
have
you
been
taken
into
his
kindly
care
i
congratulate
you
sadie
was
still
very
angry
or
she
would
never
have
been
guilty
of
the
shocking
impropriety
of
her
next
remark
but
it
is
a
lamentable
fact
that
people
will
say
and
do
very
strange
things
when
they
are
angry
things
of
which
they
have
occasion
to
repent
in
cooler
moments
fixing
her
bright
eyes
full
and
searchingly
on
douglass
she
said
abruptly
he
was
warning
me
against
the
impropriety
of
associating
with
your
dangerous
self
a
look
as
of
sadness
and
deep
pain
crossed
douglass
face
and
he
thought
aloud
rather
than
said
is
that
man
determined
i
shall
have
no
friends
sadie
was
touched
she
struck
soft
sweet
chords
with
a
slow
and
gentle
movement
as
she
asked
what
is
your
offense
in
his
eyes
dr
douglass
then
indeed
douglass
seemed
embarrassed
maintaining
though
a
sort
of
hesitating
dignity
as
he
attempted
a
reply
why
i
he
i
would
rather
not
tell
you
miss
ried
it
sounds
badly
then
with
a
little
slightly
mournful
laugh
and
that
half
admission
sounds
badly
too
worse
than
the
simple
truth
perhaps
well
then
i
had
the
misfortune
to
cross
his
path
professionally
once
a
little
matter
a
slight
mistake
not
worth
repeating
neither
would
i
repeat
it
if
it
were
in
honor
to
him
he
is
a
man
of
skill
and
since
then
has
risen
high
one
would
not
suppose
that
he
would
give
that
little
incident
of
the
past
a
thought
now
but
he
seems
never
to
have
forgiven
me
the
music
stopped
entirely
and
sadie
great
truthful
eyes
were
fixed
in
horror
on
his
face
is
it
possible
she
said
at
length
that
is
all
and
he
can
bear
such
determined
toward
you
and
they
call
him
an
earnest
christian
at
which
remark
douglass
laughed
a
low
quick
laugh
as
if
he
found
it
quite
impossible
to
restrain
his
mirth
and
then
became
instantly
grave
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon
for
what
douglass
and
why
did
you
laugh
for
laughing
and
i
laughed
because
i
could
not
restrain
a
feeling
of
amusement
at
your
innocently
connecting
his
unpleasant
state
of
mind
with
his
professions
of
christianity
should
they
not
be
connected
well
that
depends
upon
how
much
importance
you
attach
to
them
douglass
what
do
you
mean
treason
i
suspect
viewed
from
your
standpoint
and
therefore
it
would
be
much
more
proper
for
me
not
to
talk
about
it
but
i
want
you
to
talk
about
it
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
no
faith
in
any
one
religion
how
much
have
you
douglass
that
is
a
very
yankee
way
of
answering
a
question
i
know
but
it
is
the
easiest
way
of
reaching
my
point
so
i
repeat
how
much
faith
have
you
in
these
christian
professions
or
in
other
words
how
many
professing
christians
do
you
know
who
are
particularly
improved
in
your
estimation
by
their
professions
the
old
questioning
of
sadie
own
heart
brought
before
her
again
oh
christian
sister
with
whom
so
many
years
of
her
life
had
been
spent
with
whom
she
had
been
so
closely
connected
if
she
could
but
have
turned
to
you
and
remembering
your
earnest
life
your
honest
endeavors
toward
the
right
your
earnest
struggles
with
sin
and
self
the
evident
marks
of
the
lord
jesus
all
about
you
and
remembering
this
have
quelled
the
tempter
in
human
form
who
stood
waiting
for
a
verdict
with
a
determined
i
have
known
what
might
not
have
been
gained
for
your
side
that
night
chapter
xii
three
people
as
it
was
she
hesitated
and
thought
not
of
ester
life
had
not
been
such
as
to
be
counted
for
a
moment
of
her
mother
well
ried
religion
had
been
of
a
negative
rather
than
of
a
positive
sort
at
least
outwardly
she
never
spoke
much
of
these
matters
and
sadie
positively
did
not
know
whether
she
ever
prayed
or
not
how
was
she
to
decide
whether
the
gentle
patient
life
was
the
outgrowth
of
religion
in
her
heart
or
whether
it
was
a
natural
sweetness
of
disposition
and
tenderness
of
feeling
then
there
was
van
anden
an
hour
ago
she
would
surely
have
said
him
but
now
it
was
impossible
so
as
the
silence
and
the
peculiar
smile
on
douglass
face
grew
uncomfortable
she
answered
hurriedly
i
do
know
many
christian
people
doctor
and
then
more
truthfully
but
i
do
consider
those
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
in
any
degree
remarkable
yet
at
the
same
time
i
do
choose
to
set
down
the
entire
christian
world
as
a
company
of
miserable
hypocrites
not
at
all
the
doctor
answered
quickly
i
assure
you
i
have
many
friends
among
that
class
of
people
whom
i
respect
and
esteem
but
since
you
have
pressed
me
to
continue
this
conversation
i
must
frankly
confess
to
you
that
my
esteem
is
not
based
on
the
fact
that
they
are
called
christians
i
but
miss
ried
this
is
entirely
unlike
and
beneath
me
to
interfere
with
and
shake
your
innocent
trusting
faith
i
would
not
do
it
for
the
world
sadie
interrupted
him
with
an
impatient
shake
of
her
head
do
talk
nonsense
douglass
if
you
can
help
it
i
do
feel
innocent
at
all
just
now
at
least
and
i
have
no
particular
faith
to
shake
if
i
had
i
hope
you
would
not
consider
it
such
a
flimsy
material
as
to
be
shaken
by
any
thing
which
you
have
said
as
yet
i
certainly
have
heard
no
arguments
occasionally
i
think
of
these
matters
and
i
have
been
surprised
and
not
a
little
puzzled
to
note
the
strange
inconsistency
existing
between
the
profession
and
practice
of
these
people
if
you
have
any
explanation
i
should
like
to
hear
it
that
is
all
clearly
this
man
must
use
at
least
the
semblance
of
sense
if
he
were
going
to
continue
the
conversation
his
answer
was
grave
and
guarded
i
have
offered
no
arguments
nor
do
i
mean
to
i
was
apologizing
for
having
touched
upon
this
matter
at
all
i
am
unfortunate
in
my
belief
or
rather
disbelief
but
it
is
no
part
of
my
intention
to
press
it
upon
others
i
incline
to
the
opinion
that
there
are
some
very
good
nice
pleasant
people
in
the
world
whom
the
accidents
of
birth
and
education
have
taught
to
believe
that
they
are
aided
in
this
goodness
and
pleasantness
by
a
more
than
human
power
and
this
belief
rather
helps
than
otherwise
to
mature
their
naturally
sweet
pure
lives
my
explanation
of
their
seeming
inconsistencies
is
that
they
have
never
realized
the
full
moral
force
of
the
rules
which
they
profess
to
follow
i
divide
the
world
into
two
distinct
classes
the
christian
world
i
mean
those
whom
i
have
just
named
constitute
one
class
and
the
other
is
composed
of
unmitigated
hypocrites
now
my
friend
i
have
talked
longer
on
this
subject
than
i
like
or
than
i
ought
i
beg
you
will
forget
all
i
have
said
and
give
me
some
music
to
close
the
scene
sadie
laughed
and
ran
her
fingers
lightly
over
the
keys
but
she
asked
in
which
class
do
you
place
your
brother
in
the
profession
doctor
douglass
drew
his
shoulder
into
a
very
slight
though
expressive
shrug
as
he
answered
it
is
exceedingly
proper
and
also
rather
rare
for
a
physician
to
be
eminent
not
only
for
skill
but
piety
and
my
brother
practitioner
is
a
wise
and
wary
man
who
and
here
he
paused
abruptly
miss
ried
he
added
after
a
moment
in
an
entirely
changed
tone
which
of
us
is
at
fault
you
or
myself
that
i
seem
bent
on
making
uncharitable
remarks
i
really
did
not
imagine
myself
so
totally
depraved
and
to
be
serious
i
am
very
sorry
that
this
style
of
conversation
was
ever
commenced
i
did
not
intend
it
i
do
not
believe
in
interfering
with
the
beliefs
or
controverting
the
opinions
of
others
apparently
sadie
had
recovered
her
good
humor
for
her
laugh
was
as
light
and
careless
as
usual
when
she
made
answer
do
distress
yourself
unnecessarily
douglass
you
have
done
me
the
least
harm
i
assure
you
i
do
believe
a
word
you
say
and
i
do
you
the
honor
of
believing
that
you
do
credit
more
than
of
it
yourself
now
i
going
to
play
you
the
stormiest
piece
of
music
you
ever
heard
in
your
life
and
the
keys
rattled
and
rang
under
her
touch
and
drew
half
a
dozen
loungers
from
the
halls
to
the
parlor
and
effectually
ended
the
conversation
three
people
belonging
to
that
household
held
each
a
conversation
with
their
own
thoughts
that
night
which
to
finite
eyes
would
have
aided
the
right
wonderfully
had
it
been
said
before
the
assembled
three
instead
of
in
the
quiet
and
privacy
of
their
own
rooms
sadie
had
calmed
down
and
as
a
natural
consequence
was
somewhat
ashamed
of
herself
and
as
she
rolled
up
and
pinned
and
otherwise
snugged
her
curls
into
order
for
the
night
scolded
herself
after
this
fashion
sadie
ried
you
made
a
simpleton
of
yourself
in
that
speech
which
you
made
to
van
anden
because
you
think
a
man
interferes
with
what
does
concern
him
is
no
reason
why
you
should
grow
flushed
and
angry
and
forget
that
you
a
lady
you
said
some
very
rude
and
insulting
words
and
you
know
your
poor
dear
mother
would
tell
you
so
if
she
knew
any
thing
about
it
which
she
wo
one
comfort
and
besides
you
have
probably
offended
those
delightful
black
ponies
and
it
will
be
forever
before
they
will
take
you
another
ride
and
that
worse
than
all
the
rest
but
who
would
think
of
van
anden
being
such
a
man
i
wish
douglass
had
gone
to
europe
before
he
told
me
it
was
rather
pleasant
to
believe
in
the
extreme
goodness
of
somebody
i
wonder
how
much
of
that
nonsense
which
douglass
talks
he
believes
any
way
perhaps
he
is
half
right
only
i
not
going
to
think
any
such
thing
because
it
would
be
wicked
and
i
good
and
because
in
a
graver
tone
and
with
a
little
reverent
touch
of
an
old
worn
book
which
lay
on
her
bureau
this
is
my
father
bible
and
he
lived
and
died
by
its
precepts
up
another
flight
of
stairs
in
his
own
room
douglass
lighted
his
cigar
fixed
himself
comfortably
in
his
with
his
feet
on
the
and
between
the
puffs
talked
after
this
fashion
sorry
we
ran
into
this
miserable
train
of
talk
but
that
young
witch
leads
a
man
on
so
i
glad
she
has
a
decided
mind
of
her
own
one
feels
less
i
what
they
call
a
skeptic
myself
but
after
all
i
do
quite
like
to
see
a
lady
become
one
sha
lead
her
astray
i
would
have
said
any
thing
if
it
had
been
for
that
miserable
hypocrite
of
a
van
anden
the
fellow
must
learn
not
to
pitch
into
me
if
he
wants
to
be
let
alone
but
i
doubt
if
he
accomplished
much
this
time
what
a
witch
she
is
and
douglass
removed
his
cigar
long
enough
to
give
vent
to
a
hearty
laugh
in
remembrance
of
some
of
sadie
remarks
just
across
the
hall
van
anden
sat
before
his
table
one
hand
partly
shading
his
eyes
from
the
gaslight
while
he
read
and
the
words
which
he
read
were
these
o
let
not
the
oppressed
returned
ashamed
let
the
poor
and
needy
praise
thy
name
arise
o
god
plead
thine
own
cause
remember
how
the
foolish
man
reproacheth
thee
daily
forget
not
the
voice
of
thine
enemies
the
tumult
of
those
that
rise
up
against
thee
increaseth
continually
something
troubled
the
doctor
his
usually
grave
face
was
tinged
with
sadness
presently
he
arose
and
paced
with
slow
measured
tread
up
and
down
the
room
i
ought
to
have
done
it
he
said
at
last
i
ought
to
have
told
her
mother
that
he
was
in
many
ways
an
unsafe
companion
for
sadie
especially
in
this
matter
he
is
a
very
cautious
guarded
fascinating
skeptic
all
the
more
fascinating
because
he
will
be
careful
not
to
shock
her
taste
with
any
errors
i
should
have
warned
them
how
came
i
to
shrink
so
miserably
from
my
duty
what
mattered
it
that
they
would
be
likely
to
ascribe
a
wrong
motive
to
my
caution
it
was
none
the
less
my
duty
on
that
account
and
the
sad
look
deepened
on
his
face
as
he
marched
slowly
back
and
forth
but
he
was
nearer
a
solution
of
his
difficulties
than
was
either
of
those
others
for
at
last
he
came
over
to
his
chair
again
and
sank
before
it
on
his
knees
now
let
us
understand
these
three
people
each
of
them
in
their
separate
ways
were
making
mistakes
sadie
had
said
that
she
was
not
going
to
believe
any
of
the
nonsense
which
douglass
talked
she
honestly
supposed
that
she
was
not
influenced
in
the
least
and
yet
she
was
mistaken
the
poison
had
entered
her
soul
as
the
days
passed
on
she
found
herself
more
frequently
caviling
over
the
shortcomings
of
professing
christians
more
quick
to
detect
their
mistakes
and
failures
more
willing
to
admit
the
thought
that
this
entire
matter
might
be
a
fable
sadie
was
the
child
of
many
prayers
and
her
father
bible
lay
on
her
speaking
for
him
now
that
his
tongue
was
silent
in
the
grave
so
she
did
not
yield
to
the
enemy
but
she
was
walking
in
the
way
of
temptation
and
the
christian
tongues
around
her
which
the
grave
had
silenced
yet
remained
as
mute
as
though
their
lips
were
already
sealed
and
so
the
path
in
which
sadie
walked
grew
daily
broader
and
more
dangerous
then
there
was
douglass
not
by
any
means
the
worst
man
that
the
world
can
produce
he
was
or
fancied
himself
to
be
a
skeptic
like
many
a
young
man
wise
in
his
own
conceit
he
had
no
very
distinct
idea
of
what
he
was
skeptical
about
nor
to
what
hights
of
illogical
nonsense
his
own
supposed
views
carried
out
would
lead
him
like
many
another
too
he
had
studied
rhetoric
and
logic
and
mathematics
and
medicine
thoroughly
and
well
he
would
have
hesitated
long
and
studied
hard
and
pondered
deeply
before
he
had
ventured
to
dispute
an
established
point
in
surgery
and
yet
with
the
inconsistent
folly
of
the
age
he
had
absurdly
set
his
seal
to
the
falsity
of
the
bible
after
giving
it
at
most
but
a
careless
reading
here
and
there
and
without
having
ever
once
honestly
made
use
of
the
means
by
which
god
has
promised
to
enlighten
the
seekers
after
knowledge
and
yet
his
eyes
being
blinded
he
did
not
realize
how
absurd
and
unreasonable
how
utterly
foolish
was
his
conduct
he
thought
himself
sincere
he
had
no
desire
to
lead
sadie
astray
from
her
early
education
and
like
most
skeptical
natures
he
quite
prided
himself
upon
the
care
with
which
he
guarded
his
peculiar
views
although
i
could
never
see
why
that
was
being
any
other
than
miserably
selfish
or
inconsistent
for
it
is
saying
in
effect
one
of
two
things
either
my
belief
is
sacred
to
myself
alone
and
nobody
else
shall
have
the
benefit
of
it
if
i
can
help
it
or
else
i
am
very
much
ashamed
of
my
position
as
a
skeptic
and
i
shall
keep
it
to
myself
as
much
as
possible
be
that
as
it
may
douglass
so
thought
and
was
sincere
in
his
intentions
to
do
sadie
no
harm
yet
as
the
days
came
and
went
he
was
continually
doing
her
injury
they
were
much
in
each
other
society
and
the
subject
which
he
meant
should
be
avoided
was
constantly
intruding
both
were
so
constantly
on
the
alert
to
see
and
hear
the
unwise
and
inconsistent
and
unchristian
acts
and
words
and
also
alas
there
were
so
many
to
be
seen
and
heard
that
these
two
made
rapid
strides
in
the
broad
road
finally
there
was
van
anden
carrying
about
with
him
a
sad
and
heavy
heart
he
could
but
feel
that
he
had
shrunken
from
his
duty
hidden
behind
that
most
miserable
of
all
excuses
what
will
people
think
if
douglass
had
had
any
title
but
that
particular
one
prefixed
to
his
name
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
have
advised
ried
concerning
him
but
how
could
he
endure
the
suspicion
that
he
was
jealous
of
douglass
then
in
trying
to
right
the
wrong
by
warning
sadie
he
was
made
to
realize
as
many
a
poor
christian
has
realized
before
him
that
he
was
making
the
sacrifice
too
late
and
in
vain
there
was
yet
another
thing
douglass
statements
to
sadie
had
been
colored
with
truth
among
his
other
honest
mistakes
was
the
belief
that
van
anden
was
a
hypocrite
they
had
clashed
in
former
years
douglass
had
been
most
in
the
wrong
though
what
man
unhelped
by
christ
was
ever
known
to
believe
this
of
himself
but
there
had
been
wrong
also
on
the
other
side
hasty
words
spoken
words
which
rankled
and
were
rankling
still
after
the
lapse
of
years
van
anden
had
never
said
i
should
not
have
spoken
thus
i
am
sorry
he
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
it
would
be
an
unnecessary
humiliation
for
him
to
say
this
to
a
man
who
had
so
deeply
wronged
him
but
to
do
our
doctor
justice
time
had
healed
the
wound
with
him
it
was
not
personal
enmity
which
prompted
his
warning
neither
had
he
any
idea
of
the
injury
which
those
sharp
words
of
his
were
doing
in
the
unsanctified
heart
and
when
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
that
night
he
prayed
earnestly
for
the
conversion
of
sadie
and
douglass
so
these
three
lived
their
lives
under
that
same
roof
and
guessed
not
what
the
end
might
be
chapter
xiii
the
strange
christian
abbie
said
ester
wriggling
herself
around
from
before
an
open
trunk
and
letting
a
mass
of
collars
and
cuffs
slide
to
the
floor
in
her
earnestness
do
you
know
i
think
you
the
very
strangest
girl
i
ever
knew
in
my
life
i
sure
i
did
not
abbie
answered
gaily
if
it
a
nice
do
tell
me
about
it
i
like
to
be
nice
ever
so
much
well
but
i
am
in
earnest
abbie
you
certainly
are
these
very
collars
made
me
think
of
it
oh
dear
me
they
are
all
on
the
floor
and
she
reached
after
the
shining
sliding
things
abbie
came
and
sat
down
beside
her
presently
with
a
mass
of
puffy
lace
in
her
hands
which
she
was
putting
into
shape
suppose
we
have
a
little
talk
all
about
myself
she
said
gently
and
seriously
and
please
tell
me
ester
plainly
and
simply
what
you
mean
by
the
term
do
you
know
i
have
heard
it
so
often
that
sometimes
i
fear
i
really
am
painfully
unlike
other
people
you
are
just
the
one
to
enlighten
me
ester
laughed
a
little
as
she
answered
you
are
taking
the
matter
very
seriously
i
did
not
mean
any
thing
dreadful
ah
but
you
are
not
to
be
excused
in
that
way
my
dear
ester
i
look
to
you
for
information
mother
has
made
the
remark
a
great
many
times
but
it
is
generally
connected
in
some
way
with
religious
topics
and
mother
you
know
is
not
a
christian
therefore
i
have
thought
that
perhaps
some
things
seemed
strange
to
her
which
would
not
to
for
instance
but
since
you
have
been
here
you
have
spoken
your
surprise
concerning
me
several
times
and
looked
it
oftener
and
i
find
that
even
my
stiff
and
glossy
and
every
way
proper
collars
and
cuffs
excite
it
so
do
please
tell
me
ought
i
to
be
in
a
lunatic
asylum
somewhere
instead
of
preparing
to
go
to
europe
now
although
ester
laughed
again
at
the
mixture
of
comic
and
pathetic
in
abbie
tone
yet
something
in
the
words
had
evidently
embarrassed
her
there
was
a
little
struggle
in
her
mind
and
then
she
came
boldly
forth
with
her
honest
thoughts
well
the
strangeness
is
connected
with
religious
topics
in
my
mind
also
even
though
i
am
a
professing
christian
i
do
not
understand
you
i
am
an
economist
in
dress
you
know
abbie
i
do
care
for
these
things
in
the
least
but
if
i
had
the
money
as
you
have
there
are
a
great
many
things
which
i
should
certainly
have
you
see
there
is
no
earthly
sense
in
your
economy
and
yet
you
hesitate
over
expenses
almost
as
much
as
i
do
there
was
a
little
gleam
of
mischief
in
abbie
eyes
as
she
answered
will
you
tell
me
ester
why
you
would
take
the
trouble
to
get
things
if
you
do
not
care
for
them
in
the
least
why
because
because
they
would
be
proper
and
befitting
my
station
in
life
do
i
dress
in
a
manner
unbecoming
to
my
station
in
life
no
said
ester
promptly
admiring
even
then
the
crimson
finishings
of
her
cousin
but
then
well
abbie
do
you
think
it
is
wicked
to
like
nice
things
no
abbie
answered
very
gently
but
i
think
it
is
wrong
to
school
ourselves
into
believing
that
we
do
not
care
for
any
thing
of
the
kind
when
in
reality
it
is
a
higher
better
motive
which
deters
us
from
having
many
things
forgive
me
ester
but
i
think
you
are
unjust
sometimes
to
your
better
self
in
this
very
way
ester
gave
a
little
start
and
realized
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
girl
though
she
was
she
had
been
practicing
a
pretty
little
deception
of
this
kind
and
actually
palming
it
off
on
herself
in
a
moment
however
she
returned
to
the
charge
but
abbie
did
aunt
helen
really
want
you
to
have
that
pearl
velvet
we
saw
at
stewart
she
really
did
and
you
refused
it
and
i
refused
it
well
is
that
to
be
set
down
as
a
matter
of
religion
too
this
question
was
asked
with
very
much
of
ester
old
sharpness
of
tone
abbie
answered
her
with
a
look
of
amazement
i
think
we
understand
each
other
she
said
at
length
with
the
gentlest
of
tones
that
dress
ester
with
all
its
belongings
could
not
have
cost
less
than
seven
hundred
dollars
could
i
a
follower
of
the
meek
and
lowly
jesus
living
in
a
world
where
so
many
of
his
poor
are
suffering
have
been
guilty
of
wearing
such
a
dress
as
that
my
dear
i
do
think
you
sustain
the
charge
against
me
thus
far
i
see
now
how
these
pretty
little
collar
and
by
the
way
ester
you
are
crushing
one
of
them
against
that
green
box
suggested
the
thought
but
you
surely
do
not
consider
it
strange
when
i
have
such
an
array
of
collars
already
that
i
did
not
pay
thirty
dollars
for
that
bit
of
a
cobweb
which
we
saw
yesterday
but
aunt
helen
wanted
you
to
a
sad
and
troubled
look
stole
over
abbie
face
as
she
answered
my
mother
remember
dear
ester
does
not
realize
that
she
is
not
her
own
but
has
been
bought
with
a
price
you
and
i
know
and
feel
that
we
must
give
an
account
of
our
stewardship
ester
do
you
see
how
people
who
ask
god
to
help
them
in
every
little
thing
which
they
have
to
decide
in
the
least
expenditure
of
money
can
after
that
deliberately
fritter
it
away
do
you
ask
god
help
in
these
matters
why
certainly
with
the
wondering
look
in
her
eyes
which
ester
had
learned
to
know
and
dislike
therefore
ye
do
you
know
but
abbie
going
out
shopping
to
buy
handkerchiefs
for
instance
that
seems
to
me
a
very
small
thing
to
pray
about
even
the
purchase
of
handkerchiefs
may
involve
a
question
of
conscience
my
dear
ester
as
you
would
realize
if
you
had
seen
the
wicked
purchases
that
i
have
in
that
line
and
some
way
i
never
can
feel
that
any
thing
that
has
to
do
with
me
is
of
less
importance
than
a
tiny
sparrow
and
yet
you
know
he
looks
after
them
abbie
do
you
mean
to
say
that
in
every
little
thing
that
you
buy
you
weigh
the
subject
and
discuss
the
right
and
wrong
of
it
i
certainly
do
try
to
find
out
just
exactly
what
is
right
and
then
do
it
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
act
in
this
world
so
small
as
to
be
neither
right
nor
wrong
then
said
ester
with
an
impatient
twitch
of
her
dress
from
under
abbie
rocker
i
do
see
the
use
in
being
rich
nobody
is
rich
ester
only
god
but
i
so
glad
sometimes
that
he
has
trusted
me
with
so
much
of
his
wealth
that
i
feel
like
praying
a
prayer
about
that
one
thing
a
thanksgiving
what
else
am
i
strange
about
ester
everything
with
growing
impatience
i
think
it
was
as
queer
in
you
as
possible
not
to
go
to
the
concert
last
evening
with
uncle
ralph
but
ester
it
was
evening
well
suppose
it
was
there
is
every
week
and
there
is
this
particular
singer
very
often
and
uncle
ralph
was
disappointed
i
thought
you
believed
in
honoring
your
parents
you
forget
dear
ester
that
father
said
he
was
particularly
anxious
that
i
should
do
as
i
thought
right
and
that
he
should
not
have
purchased
the
tickets
if
he
had
remembered
the
meeting
father
likes
consistency
well
that
is
just
the
point
i
want
to
know
if
you
call
it
inconsistent
to
leave
your
prayer
meeting
for
just
one
evening
no
matter
for
what
reason
abbie
laughed
in
answer
do
you
know
ester
you
would
make
a
good
lawyer
you
do
stick
to
the
point
it
is
a
great
many
reasons
that
might
be
suggested
that
we
are
talking
about
it
is
simply
a
concert
then
more
gravely
i
try
to
be
very
careful
about
this
matter
so
many
detentions
are
constantly
occurring
in
the
city
that
unless
the
line
were
very
i
should
not
get
to
at
all
there
are
occasions
of
course
when
i
must
be
detained
but
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
must
be
more
than
a
concert
that
detains
me
i
do
believe
in
making
religion
such
a
very
solemn
matter
as
that
all
amounts
to
it
has
a
tendency
to
drive
people
away
from
it
the
look
on
abbie
face
in
answer
to
this
testily
spoken
sentence
was
a
mixture
of
bewilderment
and
pain
i
do
understand
she
said
at
length
how
is
that
a
solemn
matter
if
we
really
expect
to
meet
our
savior
at
a
is
it
a
delightful
thought
i
am
very
happy
when
i
can
go
to
the
place
of
prayer
ester
voice
savored
decidedly
of
the
one
which
she
was
wont
to
use
in
her
very
worst
moods
in
that
long
at
home
of
course
i
should
have
remembered
that
foster
would
be
at
the
and
not
at
the
concert
that
was
reason
enough
for
your
enjoyment
the
rich
blood
surged
in
waves
over
abbie
face
during
this
rude
address
but
she
said
not
a
single
word
in
answer
after
a
little
silence
she
spoke
in
a
voice
that
trembled
with
feeling
ester
there
is
one
thought
in
connection
with
this
subject
that
troubles
me
very
much
do
you
really
think
as
you
have
intimated
that
i
am
selfish
that
i
consult
my
own
tastes
and
desires
too
much
and
so
do
injury
to
the
cause
for
instance
do
you
think
i
prejudiced
my
father
what
a
sweet
humble
even
tearful
face
it
was
and
what
a
question
to
ask
of
ester
what
had
developed
this
disagreeable
state
of
mind
save
the
confused
upbraidings
of
her
hitherto
quiet
conscience
over
the
contrast
between
cousin
abbie
life
and
hers
here
in
the
very
face
of
her
theories
to
the
contrary
in
very
defiance
to
her
belief
in
the
folly
and
fashion
and
worldliness
that
prevailed
in
the
city
in
the
very
heart
of
this
great
city
set
down
in
the
midst
of
wealth
and
temptation
had
she
found
this
young
lady
daughter
of
one
of
the
merchant
princes
the
almost
bride
of
one
of
the
brightest
stars
in
the
new
york
galaxy
on
the
eve
of
a
brilliant
departure
for
foreign
shores
with
a
whirl
of
preparation
and
excitement
about
her
enough
to
dizzy
the
brain
of
a
dozen
ordinary
mortals
yet
moving
sweetly
brightly
quietly
through
it
all
and
manifestly
finding
her
highest
source
of
enjoyment
in
the
presence
of
and
daily
communion
with
her
savior
all
ester
speculations
concerning
her
had
come
to
naught
she
had
planned
the
wardrobe
of
the
bride
over
and
over
again
for
days
before
she
saw
her
and
while
she
had
prepared
proper
little
lectures
for
her
on
the
folly
and
sinfulness
of
fashionable
attire
had
yet
delighted
in
the
prospect
of
the
beauty
and
elegance
around
her
how
had
her
prospects
been
blighted
beauty
there
certainly
was
in
everything
but
it
was
the
beauty
of
simplicity
not
at
all
such
a
display
of
silks
and
velvets
and
jewels
as
ester
had
planned
it
certainly
could
not
be
wealth
which
made
abbie
life
such
a
happy
one
for
she
regulated
her
expenses
with
a
care
and
forethought
such
as
ester
had
never
even
dreamed
of
it
could
not
be
a
life
of
ease
a
freedom
from
annoyance
which
kept
her
bright
and
sparkling
for
it
had
only
taken
a
week
sojourn
in
her
aunt
helen
home
to
discover
to
ester
the
fact
that
all
wealthy
people
were
not
necessarily
amiable
and
delightful
abbie
was
evidently
rasped
and
thwarted
in
a
hundred
little
ways
having
a
hundred
little
trials
which
had
never
been
called
upon
to
endure
in
short
ester
had
discovered
that
the
mere
fact
of
living
in
a
great
city
was
not
in
itself
calculated
to
make
the
christian
race
more
easy
or
more
pleasant
she
had
begun
to
suspect
that
it
might
not
even
be
quite
so
easy
as
it
was
in
a
quiet
country
home
and
so
one
by
one
all
her
explanations
of
peculiar
character
had
become
bubbles
and
had
vanished
as
bubbles
do
what
then
sustained
and
guided
her
cousin
clearly
ester
was
shut
up
to
this
one
conclusion
it
was
an
christian
faith
and
trust
but
then
had
not
this
same
faith
and
yet
could
any
contrast
be
greater
than
was
abbie
life
contrasted
with
hers
there
was
no
use
in
denying
it
no
use
in
lulling
and
coaxing
her
conscience
any
longer
it
had
been
for
one
whole
week
in
a
new
atmosphere
it
had
roused
itself
it
was
not
thoroughly
awake
as
yet
but
restless
and
nervous
and
on
the
alert
and
be
hushed
back
into
its
lethargic
state
this
it
was
which
made
ester
the
uncomfortable
companion
which
she
was
this
morning
she
was
not
willing
to
be
shaken
and
roused
she
had
been
saying
very
unkind
rude
things
to
abbie
and
now
instead
of
flouncing
off
in
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
indignation
which
course
ester
could
but
think
would
be
the
most
comfortable
thing
which
could
happen
next
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
abbie
sat
still
with
that
look
of
meek
inquiry
on
her
face
humbly
awaiting
her
verdict
how
ester
wished
she
had
never
asked
that
last
question
how
ridiculous
it
would
make
her
appear
after
all
that
had
been
said
to
admit
that
her
cousin
life
had
been
one
continual
reproach
of
her
own
that
concerning
this
very
matter
of
the
concert
she
had
heard
uncle
ralph
remark
that
if
all
the
world
matched
what
they
did
with
what
they
said
as
well
as
abbie
did
he
was
not
sure
but
he
might
be
a
christian
himself
then
suppose
she
should
add
that
this
very
pointed
remark
had
been
made
to
her
when
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
concert
in
question
altogether
ester
was
disgusted
and
wished
she
could
get
back
to
where
the
conversation
commenced
feeling
certain
now
that
she
would
leave
a
great
many
things
unsaid
i
do
not
know
how
the
conversation
would
have
ended
whether
ester
could
have
brought
herself
to
the
plain
truth
and
been
led
on
and
on
to
explain
the
unrest
and
dissatisfaction
of
her
own
heart
and
thus
have
saved
herself
much
of
the
sharp
future
in
store
for
her
but
one
of
those
unfortunate
interruptions
which
seem
to
finite
eyes
to
be
constantly
occurring
now
came
to
them
there
was
an
unusual
bang
to
the
front
door
the
sound
of
strange
footsteps
in
the
hall
the
echo
of
a
strange
voice
floated
up
to
her
and
abbie
with
a
sudden
flinging
of
thimble
and
scissors
and
an
exclamation
of
ralph
has
come
vanished
chapter
xiv
the
little
card
left
to
herself
ester
found
her
train
of
thought
so
thoroughly
disagreeable
that
she
hastened
to
rid
herself
of
it
and
seized
upon
the
new
comer
to
afford
her
a
substitute
this
cousin
whom
she
had
expected
to
influence
for
good
had
at
last
arrived
ester
interest
in
him
had
been
very
strong
ever
since
that
evening
of
her
arrival
when
she
had
been
appealed
to
to
use
her
influence
on
him
just
in
what
way
she
had
an
idea
abbie
had
never
spoken
of
it
since
and
seemed
to
have
lost
much
of
her
eager
desire
that
the
cousins
should
meet
ester
mused
about
all
this
now
she
wished
she
knew
just
in
what
way
she
was
expected
to
be
of
benefit
abbie
was
evidently
troubled
about
him
perhaps
he
was
rough
and
awkward
often
were
even
those
born
in
a
city
very
much
of
ralph
life
had
been
spent
away
from
home
she
knew
and
she
had
often
heard
that
boys
away
from
home
influences
grew
rude
and
coarse
oftentimes
yes
that
was
undoubtedly
it
shy
too
he
was
of
course
he
was
of
about
the
age
to
be
that
she
could
imagine
just
how
he
looked
he
felt
out
of
place
in
the
grand
mansion
which
he
called
home
but
where
he
had
passed
so
small
a
portion
of
his
time
probably
he
did
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
nor
his
feet
and
just
as
likely
as
not
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
ate
with
his
knife
school
was
a
horrid
place
for
picking
up
all
sorts
of
ill
manners
of
course
all
these
things
must
annoy
abbie
very
much
especially
at
this
time
when
he
must
necessarily
come
so
often
in
contact
with
that
perfection
of
gentlemanliness
foster
i
wish
thought
ester
at
this
point
growing
a
little
anxious
i
wish
there
was
more
than
a
week
before
the
wedding
however
i
do
my
best
abbie
shall
see
i
good
for
something
although
i
do
differ
with
her
somewhat
in
her
peculiar
views
i
believe
i
know
how
to
conduct
myself
with
ease
in
almost
any
position
if
i
have
been
brought
up
in
the
country
and
by
the
time
the
rang
a
girl
more
thoroughly
satisfied
with
herself
and
her
benevolent
intentions
than
was
this
same
ester
could
hardly
have
been
found
she
stood
before
the
glass
smoothing
the
shining
bands
of
hair
preparatory
to
tying
a
blue
satin
ribbon
over
them
when
abbie
fluttered
in
forgive
me
a
great
many
times
for
rushing
off
in
the
flutter
i
did
and
leaving
you
behind
and
staying
away
so
long
you
see
i
seen
ralph
in
quite
a
little
time
and
i
forgot
everything
else
your
hair
does
need
another
bit
of
brushing
ester
it
as
smooth
as
velvet
they
are
all
waiting
for
us
in
the
and
i
want
to
show
you
to
ralph
and
before
the
blue
satin
ribbon
was
tied
quite
to
her
satisfaction
ester
was
hurried
to
the
to
take
up
her
new
role
of
guide
and
general
assistant
to
the
awkward
youth
i
suppose
he
has
an
idea
what
to
say
to
me
was
her
last
compassionate
thought
as
abbie
hand
rested
on
the
knob
i
hope
he
wo
be
hopelessly
quiet
but
i
manage
in
some
way
at
first
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
as
abbie
said
eagerly
ralph
here
is
cousin
ester
the
door
swung
back
into
its
place
and
revealed
a
tall
young
man
with
a
face
and
the
brightest
of
dancing
eyes
he
came
forward
immediately
extending
both
hands
and
speaking
in
a
rapid
voice
come
at
last
i
do
refer
to
myself
you
understand
but
to
this
prospect
of
greeting
my
cousin
ester
ought
i
to
welcome
you
or
you
me
which
is
it
i
somewhat
bewildered
as
to
proprieties
this
fearfully
near
approach
to
a
wedding
has
confused
my
brain
sis
turning
suddenly
to
abbie
have
you
prepared
ester
for
her
fate
does
she
fully
understand
that
she
and
i
are
to
officiate
that
is
if
we
evaporate
before
the
eventful
day
sis
how
could
you
have
the
conscience
to
perpetrate
a
wedding
in
august
whatever
takes
foster
abroad
just
now
any
way
and
without
waiting
for
answer
to
his
ceaseless
questions
he
ran
gaily
on
clearly
whatever
might
be
his
shortcomings
inability
to
talk
was
one
of
them
and
ester
confused
bewildered
utterly
thrown
out
of
her
prepared
part
in
the
entertainment
was
more
silent
and
awkward
than
she
had
ever
known
herself
to
be
provoked
too
with
abbie
with
ralph
with
herself
how
i
have
been
such
a
simpleton
she
asked
herself
as
seated
opposite
her
cousin
at
table
she
had
opportunity
to
watch
the
handsome
face
with
its
changeful
play
of
expression
and
note
the
air
of
pleased
attention
with
which
even
her
uncle
ralph
listened
to
his
ceaseless
flow
of
words
i
knew
he
was
older
than
abbie
and
that
this
was
his
third
year
in
college
what
could
i
have
expected
from
uncle
ralph
son
a
pretty
dunce
he
must
think
me
blushing
and
stammering
like
an
awkward
country
girl
what
on
earth
could
abbie
mean
about
needing
my
help
for
him
and
being
troubled
about
him
it
is
some
of
her
ridiculous
fanatical
nonsense
i
suppose
i
wish
she
could
ever
talk
or
act
like
anybody
else
i
do
know
that
such
is
the
case
however
ralph
was
saying
when
ester
returned
from
this
rehearsal
of
her
own
thoughts
i
can
simply
guess
at
it
which
is
as
near
an
approach
to
an
exertion
as
a
fellow
ought
to
be
obliged
to
make
in
this
weather
john
you
may
fill
my
glass
if
you
please
father
this
is
even
better
wine
than
your
cellar
usually
affords
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
sis
has
foster
made
a
temperance
man
of
you
entirely
i
see
you
are
devoted
to
ice
water
oh
certainly
ried
answered
for
her
in
the
half
contemptuous
tone
she
was
wont
to
assume
on
such
occasions
i
warn
you
ralph
to
get
all
the
enjoyment
you
can
out
of
the
present
for
abbie
intends
to
keep
you
with
her
entirely
after
she
has
a
home
of
her
own
out
of
the
reach
of
temptation
ester
glanced
hurriedly
and
anxiously
toward
her
cousin
how
did
this
pet
scheme
of
hers
become
known
to
ried
and
how
could
abbie
possibly
retain
her
habitual
under
this
sarcastic
ridicule
which
was
so
apparent
in
her
mother
voice
the
pink
on
her
cheek
did
deepen
perceptibly
but
she
answered
with
the
most
perfect
good
humor
ralph
do
be
frightened
please
i
shall
let
you
out
once
in
a
long
while
if
you
are
very
good
ralph
bent
loving
eyes
on
the
young
sweet
face
and
made
prompt
reply
i
do
know
that
i
shall
care
for
even
that
reprieve
since
you
to
be
jailer
what
could
there
be
in
this
young
man
to
cause
anxiety
or
to
wish
changed
yet
even
while
ester
queried
he
passed
his
glass
for
a
third
filling
and
taking
note
just
then
of
abbie
quick
pained
look
then
downcast
eyes
and
deeply
flushing
face
the
knowledge
came
suddenly
that
in
that
the
mischief
lay
abbie
thought
him
in
danger
and
this
was
the
meaning
of
her
unfinished
sentence
on
that
first
evening
and
her
embarrassed
silence
since
for
ester
with
her
filled
glass
always
beside
her
plate
untouched
indeed
sometimes
but
oftener
sipped
from
in
response
to
her
uncle
invitation
was
not
the
one
from
whom
help
could
be
expected
in
this
matter
and
ester
wondered
if
the
handsome
face
opposite
her
could
really
be
in
absolute
danger
or
whether
this
was
another
of
abbie
whims
at
least
it
was
pleasant
to
be
drinking
wine
before
him
and
she
left
her
glass
untouched
that
day
and
felt
thoroughly
troubled
about
that
and
everything
the
next
morning
there
was
a
shopping
excursion
and
ralph
was
smuggled
in
as
an
attendant
abbie
turned
over
the
endless
sets
of
handkerchiefs
in
bewildering
indecision
take
this
box
do
abbie
ester
urged
this
monogram
in
the
corner
is
lovely
and
that
is
the
dearest
little
sprig
in
the
world
which
is
precisely
what
troubles
me
laughed
abbie
it
is
entirely
too
dear
think
of
paying
such
an
enormous
sum
for
just
handkerchiefs
ralph
who
was
lounging
near
her
trying
hard
not
to
look
bored
elevated
his
eyebrows
as
his
ear
caught
the
sentence
and
addressed
her
in
undertone
is
foster
hard
up
if
he
is
you
are
not
on
his
hands
yet
sis
and
i
inclined
to
think
father
is
good
for
all
the
finery
you
may
happen
to
fancy
that
only
shows
your
ignorance
of
the
subject
or
your
high
opinion
of
me
i
assure
you
were
i
so
disposed
i
could
bring
father
affairs
into
a
fearful
tangle
this
very
day
just
by
indulging
a
fancy
for
finery
are
his
affairs
precarious
abbie
or
is
finery
prodigious
abbie
laid
her
hand
on
a
square
of
cobwebby
lace
that
is
dollars
ralph
what
of
that
do
you
want
it
and
ralph
hand
was
in
his
pocket
abbie
turned
with
almost
a
shiver
from
the
counter
i
hope
not
ralph
she
said
with
sudden
energy
i
hope
i
may
never
be
so
unworthy
of
my
trust
as
to
make
such
a
wicked
use
of
money
then
more
lightly
you
are
worse
than
queen
ester
here
and
her
advice
is
bewildering
enough
but
abbie
how
can
you
be
so
absurd
said
that
young
lady
returning
to
the
charge
those
are
not
very
expensive
i
am
sure
at
least
not
for
you
and
you
certainly
want
some
very
nice
ones
sure
if
i
had
of
your
spending
money
i
should
need
to
hesitate
abbie
voice
was
very
low
and
sweet
and
reached
only
her
ear
ester
silver
and
the
gold
are
and
i
have
asked
him
this
very
morning
to
help
me
in
every
little
item
to
be
careful
of
his
trust
now
do
you
think
but
ester
had
turned
away
in
a
vexed
uncomfortable
state
of
mind
and
walked
quite
to
the
other
end
of
the
store
leaving
abbie
to
complete
her
purchases
as
she
might
see
fit
she
leaned
against
the
door
tapping
her
fingers
in
a
very
softly
but
very
nervous
manner
against
the
glass
how
queer
it
was
that
in
the
smallest
matters
she
and
abbie
could
not
agree
how
was
it
possible
that
the
same
set
of
rules
could
govern
them
both
and
the
old
question
came
up
to
be
thought
over
afresh
clearly
they
were
unlike
utterly
unlike
now
was
abbie
right
and
she
wrong
or
was
abbie
no
not
wrong
the
word
would
certainly
not
apply
there
absolutely
be
no
wrong
connected
with
abbie
way
well
then
queer
unlike
other
people
unnecessarily
precise
studying
the
right
and
wrong
of
matters
which
she
had
been
wont
to
suppose
had
no
moral
bearing
of
any
sort
rather
which
she
had
never
given
any
attention
to
while
she
waited
and
queried
her
eye
caught
a
neat
little
hanging
near
her
apparently
filled
with
cards
and
bearing
in
gilt
lettering
just
above
them
the
winning
words
free
to
all
take
one
this
was
certainly
a
kindly
invitation
and
curiosity
being
aroused
as
to
what
all
this
might
be
for
she
availed
herself
of
the
invitation
and
drew
with
dainty
fingers
a
small
neat
card
from
the
case
and
read
i
solemnly
agree
god
shall
help
to
observe
regular
seasons
of
secret
prayer
it
least
in
the
morning
and
evening
of
each
day
to
read
daily
at
least
a
small
portion
of
the
bible
to
attend
at
one
or
more
every
week
if
i
have
strength
to
get
there
to
stand
up
for
jesus
always
and
everywhere
to
try
to
save
at
least
one
soul
each
year
to
engage
in
no
amusement
where
my
savior
could
not
be
a
guest
had
the
small
bit
of
been
a
coal
of
fire
it
could
not
have
been
more
suddenly
dropped
upon
the
marble
before
her
than
was
this
as
ester
startled
eyes
took
in
its
meaning
who
could
have
written
those
sentences
and
to
be
placed
there
in
a
conspicuous
corner
of
a
fashionable
store
was
she
never
to
be
at
peace
again
had
the
world
gone
wild
was
this
an
emanation
from
cousin
abbie
brain
or
were
there
many
more
cousin
abbies
in
what
she
had
supposed
was
a
wicked
city
or
oh
painful
question
which
came
back
hourly
nowadays
and
seemed
fairly
to
chill
her
blood
was
this
religion
and
had
she
none
of
it
was
her
profession
a
mockery
her
life
a
miserably
acted
lie
is
that
thing
hot
it
was
ralph
amused
voice
which
asked
this
question
close
beside
her
what
where
and
ester
turned
in
dire
confusion
why
that
bit
of
paper
or
is
it
a
ghostly
communication
from
the
world
of
spirits
you
look
startled
enough
for
me
to
suppose
anything
and
it
spun
away
from
your
grasp
very
suddenly
oh
he
added
as
he
glanced
it
through
rather
ghostly
i
must
confess
or
would
be
if
one
were
inclined
that
way
but
i
imagined
your
nerves
were
stronger
did
the
pronoun
startle
you
how
why
i
thought
perhaps
you
considered
yourself
committed
to
all
this
solemnity
before
your
time
or
as
the
children
say
what
a
comical
idea
to
hang
one
self
up
in
a
store
in
this
fashion
i
must
have
one
of
these
are
you
going
to
keep
yours
and
as
he
spoke
he
reached
forward
and
possessed
himself
of
one
of
the
cards
rather
odd
things
to
be
found
in
our
possession
would
they
be
abbie
now
would
be
just
one
of
this
sort
that
cold
shiver
trembled
again
through
ester
frame
as
she
listened
clearly
he
did
not
reckon
her
one
of
that
sort
he
had
known
her
but
one
day
and
yet
he
seemed
positive
that
she
stood
on
an
equal
footing
with
himself
oh
why
was
it
how
did
he
know
was
her
manner
then
utterly
unlike
that
of
a
christian
so
much
so
that
this
young
man
saw
it
already
or
was
it
that
glass
of
wine
from
which
she
had
sipped
last
evening
and
at
this
moment
she
would
have
given
much
to
be
back
where
she
thought
herself
two
weeks
ago
on
the
wine
question
but
she
stood
silent
and
let
him
talk
on
not
once
attempting
to
define
her
position
partly
because
there
had
crept
into
her
mind
this
fearful
doubt
unaccompanied
by
the
prayer
if
i
never
loved
before
help
me
to
begin
and
partly
oh
poor
ester
because
she
was
utterly
unused
to
confessing
her
savior
and
though
not
exactly
ashamed
of
him
at
least
she
would
have
indignantly
denied
the
charge
yet
it
was
much
less
confusing
to
keep
silence
and
let
others
think
as
they
would
this
had
been
her
rule
she
followed
it
now
and
ralph
continued
queer
world
this
is
it
how
do
you
imagine
our
army
would
have
prospered
if
of
the
soldiers
had
been
detailed
for
the
purpose
of
coaxing
the
rest
to
follow
their
leader
and
obey
orders
that
what
it
seems
to
me
the
christian
world
is
up
to
does
the
comical
side
of
it
ever
strike
you
ester
positively
i
can
hardly
keep
from
laughing
now
and
then
to
hear
the
way
in
which
dr
downing
pitches
into
his
church
members
and
they
sit
and
take
it
as
meekly
as
lambs
brought
to
the
slaughter
it
does
them
about
as
much
good
apparently
as
it
does
me
no
not
so
much
for
it
amuses
me
and
serves
to
make
me
on
good
terms
with
myself
for
half
an
hour
or
so
i
so
thoroughly
rejoiced
you
see
to
think
that
i
belong
to
that
set
of
miserable
sinners
dr
downing
does
preach
very
sharp
harsh
sermons
ester
said
at
last
feeling
the
necessity
of
saying
something
i
have
often
wondered
at
it
i
think
them
calculated
to
do
more
harm
than
good
oh
do
wonder
at
it
in
the
least
i
make
it
sharper
yet
if
i
were
he
the
necessity
exists
evidently
the
wonder
lies
in
to
my
mind
if
a
fellow
really
means
to
do
a
thing
what
does
he
wait
to
be
punched
up
about
it
everlastingly
for
hang
me
if
i
do
like
to
see
people
act
as
though
they
meant
it
even
if
the
question
is
a
religious
one
ester
how
many
times
ought
i
to
beg
your
pardon
for
using
an
unknown
tongue
in
other
words
slang
phrases
i
fancied
myself
talking
to
my
chum
delivering
a
lecture
on
theology
which
is
somewhat
out
of
my
sphere
as
you
have
doubtless
observed
yet
such
people
as
you
and
i
ca
help
having
eyes
and
ears
and
using
them
now
and
then
can
we
still
silence
on
ester
part
so
far
as
defining
her
position
was
concerned
she
was
not
ashamed
of
her
savior
now
but
of
herself
if
this
gay
cousin
eyes
were
critical
she
knew
she
could
not
bear
the
test
yet
she
rallied
sufficiently
to
condemn
within
her
own
mind
the
poor
little
cards
they
will
do
more
harm
than
good
she
told
herself
positively
to
such
young
men
as
ralph
for
instance
what
could
he
possibly
want
with
one
of
them
save
to
make
it
a
subject
of
ridicule
when
he
got
with
some
of
his
wild
companions
but
it
transpired
that
his
designs
were
not
so
very
wicked
after
all
for
as
they
left
the
store
he
took
the
little
card
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
abbie
with
a
quiet
sis
here
is
something
that
you
will
like
and
abbie
read
it
and
said
how
solemn
that
is
did
you
get
it
for
me
ralph
thank
you
and
ralph
bowed
and
smiled
on
her
a
kind
almost
tender
smile
very
unlike
the
roguish
twinkle
that
had
shone
in
his
eyes
while
he
talked
with
ester
all
through
the
busy
day
that
silent
solemn
card
haunted
ester
it
pertinaciously
refused
to
be
lost
she
dropped
it
twice
in
their
transit
from
store
to
store
but
ralph
promptly
returned
it
to
her
at
home
she
laid
it
on
her
but
piled
scarfs
and
handkerchiefs
and
gloves
over
it
as
high
as
she
might
it
was
sure
to
flutter
to
the
floor
at
her
feet
as
she
sought
hurriedly
in
the
mass
of
confusion
for
some
missing
article
once
she
seized
and
flung
it
from
the
window
in
dire
vexation
and
was
rewarded
by
having
maggie
present
it
to
her
about
two
minutes
thereafter
as
a
something
that
landed
square
on
my
head
as
i
was
coming
around
the
corner
at
last
she
actually
grew
nervous
over
it
felt
almost
afraid
to
touch
it
so
thoroughly
had
it
fastened
itself
on
her
conscience
these
great
black
letters
in
that
first
sentence
seemed
burned
into
her
brain
i
solemnly
agree
as
god
shall
help
me
at
last
she
deposited
the
unwelcome
little
monitor
at
the
very
bottom
of
her
under
some
unused
collars
telling
herself
that
it
was
for
safe
keeping
that
she
might
not
lose
it
again
not
letting
her
conscience
say
for
a
moment
that
it
was
because
she
wanted
to
bury
the
haunting
words
out
of
her
sight
chapter
xv
what
is
the
difference
ester
stood
before
her
mirror
arranging
some
disordered
braids
of
hair
she
had
come
up
from
the
for
that
purpose
it
was
just
after
dinner
the
family
with
the
addition
of
foster
were
gathered
in
the
back
parlor
whither
she
was
in
haste
to
join
them
how
things
do
conspire
to
hinder
me
she
exclaimed
impatiently
as
one
loose
after
another
slid
softly
and
silently
out
of
place
this
horrid
ribbon
does
shade
with
the
trimming
on
my
dress
either
i
wonder
what
can
have
become
of
that
blue
one
with
a
jerk
sadie
was
produced
and
the
contents
tumbled
over
the
methodical
and
orderly
ester
was
in
nervous
haste
to
get
down
to
that
fascinating
family
group
but
the
blue
ribbon
with
the
total
depravity
of
all
ribbons
remained
a
silent
and
indifferent
spectator
of
her
trials
snugged
back
in
the
corner
of
a
half
open
drawer
ester
had
set
her
heart
on
finding
it
and
the
green
came
next
under
inspection
and
being
impatiently
shoved
back
toward
its
corner
when
the
quest
proved
vain
took
that
opportunity
for
tumbling
over
the
floor
and
showering
its
contents
right
and
left
what
next
i
wonder
ester
muttered
as
she
stooped
to
scoop
up
the
disordered
mass
of
collars
ruffles
cuffs
laces
and
the
like
and
with
them
came
face
up
and
bright
black
letters
scorching
into
her
very
soul
the
little
card
with
its
i
solemnly
agree
as
god
shall
help
me
ester
paused
in
her
work
and
stood
upright
with
a
strange
beating
at
her
heart
what
this
mean
was
it
merely
chance
that
this
sentence
had
so
persistently
met
her
eye
all
this
day
put
the
card
where
she
would
and
what
was
the
matter
with
her
anyway
why
should
those
words
have
such
strange
power
over
her
why
had
she
tried
to
rid
herself
of
the
sight
of
them
she
read
each
sentence
aloud
slowly
and
carefully
now
she
said
decisively
half
irritated
that
she
was
allowing
herself
to
be
hindered
it
is
time
to
put
an
end
to
this
nonsense
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
feeling
as
i
have
of
late
these
are
all
very
reasonable
and
proper
pledges
at
least
the
most
of
them
are
i
believe
i
adopt
this
card
yes
i
will
that
is
what
has
been
the
trouble
with
me
i
neglected
my
duty
rather
i
have
so
much
care
and
work
at
home
that
i
have
time
to
attend
to
it
properly
but
here
it
is
different
it
is
quite
time
i
commenced
right
in
these
things
when
i
come
to
my
room
i
will
begin
no
i
can
not
do
that
either
for
abbie
will
be
with
me
well
the
first
opportunity
then
that
i
have
or
no
i
stop
now
this
minute
and
read
a
chapter
in
the
bible
and
pray
there
is
nothing
like
the
present
moment
for
keeping
a
good
resolution
i
like
decision
in
everything
and
i
dare
say
abbie
will
be
very
willing
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
foster
before
i
come
down
and
sincerely
desirous
to
be
at
peace
with
her
newly
troubled
conscience
and
sincerely
sure
that
she
was
in
the
right
way
for
securing
that
peace
ester
closed
and
locked
her
door
and
sat
herself
down
by
the
open
window
in
a
thoroughly
state
of
mind
to
read
the
bible
and
to
pray
poor
human
heart
so
utterly
unconscious
of
its
own
deep
sickness
so
willing
to
plaster
over
the
unhealed
wound
where
should
she
read
she
was
at
all
times
a
random
reader
of
the
bible
but
now
with
this
new
era
it
was
important
that
there
should
be
a
more
definite
aim
in
her
reading
she
turned
the
leaves
rapidly
eager
to
find
a
book
which
looked
inviting
for
the
occasion
and
finally
seized
upon
the
gospel
of
john
as
entirely
proper
and
appropriate
and
industriously
commenced
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
the
same
was
in
the
beginning
with
god
now
that
wretched
is
falling
out
again
as
sure
as
i
live
i
do
see
what
is
the
matter
with
my
hair
i
never
had
so
much
trouble
with
it
things
were
made
by
him
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
was
made
in
him
was
life
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
men
there
are
and
miss
hastings
i
wonder
if
they
are
going
to
call
here
i
wish
they
would
i
should
like
to
get
a
nearer
view
of
that
trimming
around
her
sack
it
is
lovely
whatever
it
the
light
shineth
in
darkness
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
not
now
it
was
doubtful
if
it
had
once
occurred
to
ester
who
this
glorious
word
was
or
that
he
had
aught
to
do
with
her
certainly
the
wonderful
and
gracious
truths
embodied
in
these
precious
verses
truths
which
had
to
do
with
every
hour
of
her
life
had
not
this
evening
so
much
as
made
an
entrance
into
her
busy
brain
and
yet
she
actually
thought
herself
in
the
way
of
getting
rid
of
the
troublesome
thoughts
that
had
haunted
her
the
days
just
past
the
verses
were
being
read
aloud
the
thoughts
about
the
troublesome
hair
and
the
trimmings
on
miss
hastings
sack
were
suffered
to
remain
thoughts
not
to
put
into
words
had
they
been
perhaps
even
ester
would
have
noticed
the
glaring
incongruity
as
it
was
she
continued
her
two
occupations
reading
the
verses
thinking
the
thoughts
until
at
last
she
came
to
a
sudden
pause
and
silence
reigned
in
the
room
for
several
minutes
then
there
flushed
over
ester
face
a
sudden
glow
as
she
realized
that
she
sat
bible
in
hand
one
corner
of
the
card
marking
the
verse
at
which
she
had
paused
and
that
verse
was
he
came
unto
his
own
and
his
own
received
him
not
and
she
realized
that
her
thoughts
during
the
silence
had
been
suppose
miss
hastings
should
call
and
should
inquire
for
her
and
she
should
go
with
aunt
helen
to
return
the
call
should
she
wear
black
lace
shawl
with
her
blue
silk
dress
or
simply
the
little
ruffled
cape
which
matched
the
dress
she
read
that
last
verse
over
again
with
an
uncomfortable
consciousness
that
she
was
not
getting
on
very
well
but
try
as
she
would
ester
thoughts
seemed
resolved
not
to
stay
with
that
first
chapter
of
john
they
roved
all
over
new
york
visited
all
the
places
that
she
had
seen
and
a
great
many
that
she
wanted
to
see
and
that
seemed
beyond
her
grasp
going
on
meantime
with
the
verses
and
keeping
up
a
disagreeable
undercurrent
of
disgust
over
those
same
restless
thoughts
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
and
maggie
voice
outside
miss
ried
miss
abbie
sent
me
to
say
that
there
was
company
waiting
to
see
you
and
if
you
please
would
you
come
down
as
soon
as
you
could
ester
sprang
up
very
well
she
responded
to
maggie
i
be
down
immediately
then
she
waited
to
shut
the
card
into
her
bible
to
keep
the
place
took
a
parting
peep
in
the
mirror
to
see
that
the
brown
hair
and
blue
ribbon
were
in
order
wondered
if
it
were
really
the
hastings
who
called
on
her
unlocked
her
door
and
made
a
rapid
passage
down
the
stairs
most
unpleasantly
conscious
however
at
that
very
moment
that
her
intentions
of
setting
herself
right
had
not
been
carried
out
and
also
that
so
far
as
she
had
gone
it
had
been
a
failure
truly
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
the
light
was
still
shining
in
darkness
in
the
parlor
after
the
other
company
had
departed
ester
found
herself
the
sole
companion
of
foster
at
the
further
end
of
the
long
room
abbie
half
sitting
half
kneeling
on
an
ottoman
near
her
father
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
a
very
earnest
conversation
with
him
in
which
her
mother
occasionally
joined
and
at
which
ralph
appeared
occasionally
to
laugh
but
what
was
the
subject
of
debate
they
at
their
distance
were
unable
to
determine
and
at
last
foster
turned
to
his
nearest
neighbor
and
so
miss
ester
you
manufactured
me
into
a
minister
at
our
first
meeting
in
view
of
their
nearness
to
cousinship
the
ceremony
of
surname
had
been
promptly
discarded
by
foster
but
ester
was
unable
to
recover
from
a
sort
of
awe
with
which
he
had
at
first
inspired
her
and
this
opening
sentence
appeared
to
be
a
confusing
one
for
she
flushed
deeply
and
only
bowed
her
answer
i
do
know
but
it
is
a
most
unworthy
curiosity
on
my
part
continued
foster
but
i
have
an
overwhelming
desire
to
know
why
or
rather
to
know
in
what
respect
i
am
ministerial
wo
you
enlighten
me
miss
ester
why
said
ester
growing
still
more
confused
i
thought
i
said
i
no
i
mean
i
heard
your
talk
with
that
queer
old
woman
some
of
it
and
some
things
that
you
said
made
me
think
you
must
be
a
minister
what
things
miss
ester
everything
said
ester
desperately
you
talked
you
know
about
about
religion
nearly
all
the
time
a
look
of
absolute
pain
rested
for
a
moment
on
foster
face
as
he
said
is
it
possible
that
your
experience
with
christian
men
has
been
so
unfortunate
that
you
believe
none
but
ministers
ever
converse
on
that
subject
i
never
hear
any
ester
answered
positively
but
your
example
as
a
christian
lady
i
trust
is
such
that
it
puts
to
shame
your
experience
among
gentlemen
oh
but
said
ester
still
in
great
confusion
i
did
mean
to
confine
my
statement
to
gentlemen
i
never
hear
anything
of
the
sort
from
ladies
not
from
that
dear
old
friend
of
ours
on
the
cars
oh
yes
she
was
different
from
other
people
too
i
thought
she
had
a
very
queer
way
of
speaking
but
then
she
was
old
and
ignorant
i
suppose
she
knew
how
to
talk
about
any
thing
else
and
she
is
my
one
exception
foster
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
golden
brown
head
that
was
still
in
eager
debate
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
before
he
asked
his
next
question
how
is
it
with
your
cousin
oh
she
said
ester
brought
suddenly
and
painfully
back
to
all
her
troublesome
thoughts
and
then
after
a
moment
hesitation
taking
a
quick
resolution
to
probe
this
matter
to
its
foundation
if
it
had
one
foster
do
you
think
she
is
peculiar
at
which
question
foster
laughed
then
answered
good
humoredly
do
you
think
me
a
competent
witness
in
that
matter
yes
ester
answered
gravely
too
thoroughly
in
earnest
to
be
amused
now
she
is
entirely
different
from
any
person
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
she
do
seem
to
think
about
any
thing
else
at
least
she
thinks
more
about
this
matter
than
any
other
and
that
is
being
peculiar
why
i
think
so
unnatural
i
mean
unlike
other
people
well
let
us
see
do
you
call
it
being
peculiarly
good
or
peculiarly
bad
why
said
ester
in
great
perplexity
it
is
of
course
but
she
no
she
is
very
good
the
best
person
i
ever
knew
but
it
is
being
like
nobody
else
and
nobody
be
like
her
do
you
think
so
i
certainly
do
he
answered
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
then
he
laughed
again
but
presently
noting
her
perplexed
look
he
grew
sober
and
spoke
with
quiet
gravity
i
think
i
understand
you
miss
ester
if
you
mean
do
i
not
think
abbie
has
attained
to
a
rare
growth
in
spirituality
for
one
of
her
age
i
most
certainly
do
but
if
you
mean
do
i
not
think
it
almost
impossible
for
people
in
general
to
reach
as
high
a
foothold
on
the
rock
as
she
has
gained
i
certainly
do
not
i
believe
it
is
within
the
power
and
not
only
that
but
it
is
the
blessed
privilege
and
not
only
that
but
it
is
the
sacred
duty
of
every
follower
of
the
cross
to
cling
as
close
and
climb
as
high
as
she
has
do
think
so
ester
said
with
a
decided
shake
of
the
head
it
is
much
easier
for
some
people
to
be
good
christians
than
it
is
for
others
granted
that
is
there
is
a
difference
of
temperament
certainly
but
do
you
rank
abbie
among
those
for
whom
it
was
naturally
easy
i
think
so
this
time
foster
head
was
very
gravely
shaken
if
you
had
known
her
when
i
did
you
would
not
think
so
it
was
very
hard
for
her
to
yield
her
natural
temperament
her
former
life
her
circle
of
friends
her
home
influences
were
all
against
her
and
yet
christ
triumphed
yes
but
having
once
decided
the
matter
it
is
smooth
sailing
with
her
now
do
you
think
so
has
abbie
no
trials
to
meet
no
battles
with
satan
to
fight
so
far
as
you
can
discover
only
trifles
said
ester
thinking
of
aunt
helen
and
ralph
but
deciding
that
abbie
had
luxuries
enough
to
offset
both
these
anxieties
i
believe
you
will
find
that
it
needs
precisely
the
same
help
to
meet
trifles
that
it
does
to
conquer
mountains
of
difficulty
the
difference
is
in
degree
not
in
kind
but
i
happen
to
know
that
some
of
abbie
have
been
very
heavy
and
hard
to
bear
however
the
matter
rests
just
here
miss
ester
i
believe
we
are
all
too
willing
to
be
conquered
too
willing
to
be
martyrs
not
willing
to
reach
after
and
obtain
the
settled
and
joys
of
the
christian
ester
was
thoroughly
ill
at
ease
all
this
condemned
her
and
at
last
resolved
to
escape
from
this
net
work
of
her
awakening
conscience
she
pushed
boldly
on
people
have
different
views
on
this
subject
as
well
as
on
all
others
now
abbie
and
i
do
not
agree
in
our
opinions
there
are
things
which
she
thinks
right
that
seem
to
me
quite
out
of
place
and
improper
yes
he
said
inquiringly
and
with
the
most
quiet
and
courteous
air
would
you
object
to
mentioning
some
of
those
things
well
as
an
instance
it
seemed
to
me
very
queer
indeed
to
hear
her
and
other
young
ladies
speaking
in
your
teachers
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
at
least
not
among
cultivated
people
and
you
thought
it
improper
almost
yes
quite
perhaps
at
least
should
never
do
it
were
you
at
burton
on
the
evening
in
which
our
society
met
this
to
ester
surprise
was
her
companion
next
question
she
opened
her
eyes
inquiringly
then
concluding
that
he
was
or
else
had
no
reply
to
make
and
was
weary
of
the
subject
answered
simply
and
briefly
in
the
affirmative
i
was
detained
that
night
were
there
many
out
quite
a
full
society
abbie
said
the
rooms
were
almost
crowded
pleasant
oh
very
i
hardly
wished
to
go
as
they
were
strangers
to
me
but
i
was
very
happily
disappointed
and
enjoyed
the
evening
exceedingly
were
there
reports
very
full
ones
and
burton
was
particularly
interesting
she
had
forgotten
her
notes
but
gave
her
reports
from
memory
very
beautifully
ah
i
am
sorry
for
that
it
must
have
destroyed
the
pleasure
of
the
evening
for
you
i
do
understand
mr
foster
why
you
remarked
that
you
considered
it
improper
for
ladies
to
take
part
in
such
matters
and
of
course
what
is
an
impropriety
you
can
not
have
enjoyed
oh
that
is
a
very
different
matter
it
was
not
a
i
beg
pardon
i
did
not
understand
it
is
only
at
that
it
is
improper
for
ladies
to
speak
may
i
ask
why
ester
was
growing
vexed
foster
she
said
sharply
you
know
that
it
is
quite
another
thing
there
are
gentlemen
enough
present
or
ought
to
be
to
do
the
talking
in
a
there
is
generally
a
large
proportion
of
gentlemen
at
the
society
i
presume
there
were
those
present
capable
of
giving
report
well
consider
a
society
a
very
different
thing
from
a
gathering
in
a
church
ah
then
it
the
church
that
is
at
fault
if
that
is
the
case
i
should
propose
holding
prayer
meetings
in
private
parlors
would
that
obviate
your
difficulty
no
said
ester
sharply
not
if
there
were
gentlemen
present
it
is
their
business
to
conduct
a
religious
meeting
then
after
all
it
is
religion
that
is
at
the
foundation
of
this
trouble
pray
miss
ester
was
burton
report
irreligious
foster
said
ester
with
flushing
cheeks
and
in
a
whirl
of
vexation
you
understand
me
i
think
i
do
miss
ester
the
question
is
do
you
understand
yourself
let
me
state
the
case
you
are
decidedly
not
a
rights
lady
i
am
decidedly
not
a
woman
rights
gentleman
that
is
in
the
general
acceptation
of
that
term
you
would
think
for
instance
that
abbie
was
out
of
her
sphere
in
the
pulpit
or
pleading
a
case
at
the
bar
so
should
i
in
fact
there
are
many
public
places
in
which
you
and
i
for
what
we
consider
good
and
sufficient
reasons
would
not
like
to
see
her
but
on
the
other
hand
we
both
enjoy
burton
reports
either
verbal
or
written
as
she
may
choose
we
in
company
with
many
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
listen
respectfully
we
both
greatly
enjoy
hearing
miss
ames
sing
we
both
consider
it
perfectly
proper
that
she
should
so
entertain
us
at
our
social
gatherings
at
our
literary
society
we
have
both
enjoyed
to
the
utmost
miss
hanley
exquisite
recitation
from
i
am
sure
not
a
thought
of
impropriety
occurred
to
either
of
us
we
both
enjoyed
the
familiar
talk
on
the
subject
for
the
evening
after
the
society
proper
had
adjourned
so
the
question
resolves
itself
into
this
it
seems
that
it
is
pleasant
and
proper
for
fifty
or
more
of
us
to
hear
burton
report
in
burton
parlor
to
hear
ladies
sing
to
hear
ladies
recite
in
their
own
parlors
or
in
those
of
their
friends
to
converse
familiarly
on
any
sensible
topic
but
the
moment
the
very
same
company
are
gathered
in
our
chapel
and
burton
says
for
my
class
and
miss
ames
says
love
jesus
and
miss
hanley
says
lord
is
the
strength
of
my
heart
and
my
portion
forever
it
becomes
improper
will
you
pardon
my
obtuseness
and
explain
to
me
the
wherefore
but
ester
was
not
in
a
mood
to
explain
if
indeed
she
had
aught
to
say
and
she
only
answered
with
great
decision
and
emphasis
have
never
been
accustomed
to
it
no
i
think
you
told
me
that
you
were
unaccustomed
to
hearing
poetical
recitations
from
young
ladies
does
that
condemn
them
to
which
question
ester
made
no
sort
of
answer
but
sat
looking
confused
ashamed
and
annoyed
all
in
one
her
companion
roused
himself
from
his
half
reclining
attitude
on
the
sofa
and
gave
her
the
benefit
of
a
very
searching
look
then
he
came
to
an
erect
posture
and
spoke
with
entire
change
of
tone
miss
ester
forgive
me
if
i
have
seemed
severe
in
my
questionings
and
sarcastic
in
my
replies
i
am
afraid
i
have
the
subject
is
one
which
awakens
sarcasm
in
me
it
is
so
persistently
twisted
and
befogged
and
misunderstood
some
of
the
very
best
people
seem
inclined
to
make
our
into
formidable
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
a
succession
of
not
short
sermons
rather
than
a
social
gathering
of
christians
to
sympathize
with
and
pray
for
and
help
each
other
as
i
believe
the
master
intended
them
to
be
but
may
i
say
a
word
to
you
personally
are
you
quite
happy
as
a
christian
do
you
find
your
love
growing
stronger
and
your
hopes
brighter
from
day
to
day
ester
struggled
with
herself
tore
bits
of
down
from
the
edge
of
her
fan
tried
to
regain
her
composure
and
her
voice
but
the
tender
gentle
yet
searching
tone
seemed
to
have
probed
her
very
soul
and
the
eyes
that
at
last
were
raised
to
meet
his
were
melting
into
tears
and
the
voice
which
answered
him
quivered
perceptibly
no
foster
i
am
not
happy
why
may
i
ask
you
is
the
savior
untrue
to
his
promises
or
is
his
professed
servant
untrue
to
him
ester
heart
was
giving
heavy
throbs
of
pain
and
her
conscience
was
whispering
loudly
untrue
untrue
but
she
had
made
no
answer
when
ralph
came
with
brisk
step
toward
where
they
sat
two
against
one
is
fair
play
he
said
with
a
mixture
of
mischief
and
vexation
in
his
tone
foster
do
shirk
you
have
taught
abbie
now
go
and
help
her
fight
it
out
like
a
man
come
take
yourself
over
there
and
get
her
out
of
this
scrape
i
take
care
of
ester
she
looks
as
though
she
had
been
to
and
foster
with
a
wondering
look
for
ralph
and
a
troubled
one
for
ester
moved
slowly
toward
that
end
of
the
long
parlor
where
the
voices
were
growing
louder
and
one
of
them
excited
chapter
xvi
a
victory
this
is
really
the
most
absurd
of
all
your
late
absurdities
ried
was
saying
in
rather
a
loud
tone
and
with
a
look
of
dignified
disgust
bestowed
upon
abbie
as
foster
joined
the
group
will
you
receive
me
into
this
circle
and
enlighten
me
as
regards
this
particular
absurdity
he
said
seating
himself
near
ried
oh
it
was
nothing
remarkable
that
lady
replied
in
her
most
sarcastic
tone
at
least
it
is
quite
time
we
were
growing
accustomed
to
this
new
order
of
things
abbie
is
trying
to
enlighten
her
father
on
the
new
and
interesting
question
of
temperance
especially
as
it
is
connected
with
wedding
parties
in
which
she
is
particularly
interested
just
at
present
abbie
bestowed
an
appealing
glance
on
foster
and
remained
entirely
silent
i
believe
i
can
claim
equal
interest
then
in
the
matter
he
answered
brightly
and
will
petition
you
ried
to
explain
the
point
at
issue
indeed
foster
i
not
a
temperance
lecturer
and
do
not
consider
myself
competent
to
perform
the
awful
task
i
refer
you
to
abbie
who
seems
to
be
thoroughly
posted
and
very
desirous
of
displaying
her
argumentative
powers
still
silence
on
abbie
part
and
only
a
little
tremble
of
the
lip
told
a
close
observer
how
deeply
she
felt
the
sharp
tones
and
unmotherly
words
ried
spoke
at
last
in
calm
measured
accents
my
daughter
and
i
foster
differ
somewhat
in
regard
to
the
duties
and
privileges
of
a
host
i
claim
the
right
to
set
before
my
guests
whatever
consider
proper
she
objects
to
the
use
of
wine
as
perhaps
you
are
aware
indeed
i
believe
she
has
imbibed
her
very
peculiar
views
from
you
but
i
say
to
her
that
as
i
have
always
been
in
the
habit
of
entertaining
my
guests
with
that
beverage
i
presume
i
shall
continue
to
do
so
foster
did
not
seem
in
the
mood
to
argue
the
question
but
responded
with
genial
good
humor
ah
but
ried
you
ought
to
gratify
your
daughter
in
her
parting
request
that
is
only
natural
and
courteous
is
it
not
ried
felt
called
upon
to
reply
we
have
gratified
so
many
of
her
requests
already
that
the
whole
thing
bids
fair
to
be
the
most
ridiculous
proceeding
that
new
york
has
ever
witnessed
fancy
a
dozen
rough
boys
banging
and
shouting
through
my
house
eating
cake
enough
to
make
them
sick
for
a
month
to
say
nothing
of
the
quantity
which
they
will
stamp
into
my
carpets
and
all
because
they
chance
to
belong
to
abbie
mission
class
ralph
and
ester
had
joined
the
group
in
the
meantime
and
the
former
here
interposed
that
last
argument
is
valid
mother
have
i
promised
to
hoe
out
the
rooms
myself
immediately
after
the
conclusion
of
the
solemn
services
and
foster
bestowed
a
sudden
troubled
look
on
abbie
which
she
answered
by
saying
in
a
low
voice
i
should
recall
my
invitations
to
them
under
such
circumstances
you
will
do
no
such
thing
her
father
replied
sharply
the
invitations
are
issued
in
your
parents
names
and
we
shall
have
no
such
senseless
proceedings
connected
with
them
when
you
are
in
your
own
house
you
will
doubtless
be
at
liberty
to
do
as
you
please
but
in
the
meantime
it
would
be
well
to
remember
that
you
belong
to
your
father
family
at
present
ralph
was
watching
the
flushing
cheek
and
quivering
lip
of
his
young
sister
and
at
this
point
flung
down
the
book
with
which
he
had
been
idly
playing
with
an
impatient
exclamation
it
strikes
me
father
that
you
are
making
a
tremendous
din
about
a
little
matter
i
object
to
a
glass
of
wine
myself
almost
under
any
circumstances
and
i
think
this
excruciating
sensitiveness
on
the
subject
is
absurd
and
ridiculous
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
at
the
same
time
i
should
be
willing
to
undertake
the
job
of
smashing
every
wine
bottle
there
is
in
the
cellar
at
this
moment
if
i
thought
that
sis
last
hours
in
the
body
or
at
least
in
the
paternal
mansion
would
be
made
any
more
peaceful
thereby
during
this
harangue
the
elder
ried
had
time
to
grow
ashamed
of
his
sharpness
and
answered
in
his
natural
tone
i
am
precisely
of
your
opinion
my
son
we
are
making
ado
about
nothing
we
certainly
have
often
entertained
company
before
and
abbie
has
sipped
her
wine
with
the
rest
of
us
without
sustaining
very
material
injury
thereby
so
far
as
i
can
see
and
here
is
ester
as
stanch
a
church
member
as
any
of
you
i
believe
but
that
does
seem
to
forbid
her
behaving
in
a
rational
manner
and
partaking
of
whatever
her
friends
provide
for
her
entertainment
why
can
not
the
rest
of
you
be
equally
sensible
during
the
swift
second
of
time
which
intervened
between
that
sentence
and
her
reply
ester
had
three
hard
things
to
endure
a
sting
from
her
restless
conscience
a
look
of
mingled
pain
and
anxiety
from
foster
and
one
of
and
mischievous
surprise
from
ralph
then
she
spoke
rapidly
and
earnestly
indeed
uncle
ralph
i
beg
you
will
not
judge
of
any
other
person
by
my
conduct
in
this
matter
i
am
very
sorry
and
very
much
ashamed
that
i
have
been
so
weak
and
wicked
i
think
just
as
abbie
does
only
i
am
not
like
her
and
have
been
tempted
to
do
wrong
for
fear
you
would
think
me
foolish
no
one
but
ester
knew
how
much
these
sentences
cost
her
but
the
swift
bright
look
telegraphed
her
from
abbie
eyes
seemed
to
repay
her
ralph
laughed
outright
four
against
one
he
said
gaily
i
gone
over
to
the
enemy
side
myself
you
see
on
account
of
the
pressure
father
i
advise
you
to
yield
while
you
can
do
it
gracefully
and
also
to
save
me
the
trouble
of
smashing
the
aforesaid
bottles
but
persisted
ried
i
have
heard
an
argument
this
evening
what
is
there
so
shocking
in
a
quiet
glass
of
wine
enjoyed
with
a
select
gathering
of
one
friends
john
now
presented
himself
at
the
door
with
a
respectful
if
you
please
sir
there
is
a
person
in
the
hall
who
persists
in
seeing
mr
foster
show
him
in
then
was
ried
prompt
reply
john
hesitated
and
then
added
he
is
a
very
common
looking
person
sir
and
i
said
show
him
in
i
believe
interrupted
the
gentleman
of
the
house
in
a
tone
which
plainly
indicated
that
he
was
expending
on
john
the
irritation
which
he
did
not
like
to
bestow
further
on
either
his
children
or
his
guests
john
vanished
and
ried
added
you
can
take
your
into
the
library
foster
if
it
proves
to
be
a
private
matter
there
was
a
marked
emphasis
on
the
word
in
this
sentence
but
foster
only
bowed
his
reply
and
presently
john
returned
ushering
in
a
short
stout
man
dressed
in
a
rough
working
suit
twirling
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
looking
extremely
embarrassed
and
out
of
place
in
the
elegant
parlor
foster
turned
toward
him
immediately
and
gave
him
a
greeting
both
prompt
and
cordial
ah
jones
good
evening
i
have
been
in
search
of
you
today
but
some
way
managed
to
miss
you
at
this
point
abbie
advanced
and
placed
a
small
white
hand
in
jones
great
hard
brown
one
as
she
repeated
the
friendly
greeting
and
inquired
at
once
how
is
sallie
mr
jones
well
it
is
about
her
that
i
come
and
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
turning
to
foster
for
making
so
bold
as
to
come
up
here
after
you
but
she
is
just
that
bad
that
i
could
not
find
it
in
me
to
deny
her
any
thing
and
she
is
in
a
real
taking
to
see
you
she
has
sighed
and
cried
about
it
most
of
this
day
and
we
felt
her
mother
and
me
that
we
could
stand
it
any
longer
and
i
said
i
not
come
home
till
i
found
you
and
told
you
how
much
she
wanted
to
see
you
it
asking
a
good
deal
sir
but
she
is
going
fast
she
is
and
here
jones
voice
choked
and
he
rubbed
his
hard
hand
across
his
eyes
i
will
be
down
immediately
was
foster
prompt
reply
certainly
you
should
have
come
for
me
i
should
have
been
very
sorry
indeed
to
disappoint
sallie
tell
her
i
will
be
there
in
half
an
hour
mr
jones
and
with
a
few
added
words
of
kindness
from
abbie
jones
departed
looking
relieved
and
thankful
that
man
said
foster
turning
to
ester
as
the
door
closed
after
him
is
the
son
of
our
old
lady
do
you
think
you
remember
i
engaged
to
see
her
conveyed
to
his
home
in
safety
and
my
anxiety
for
her
future
welfare
was
such
that
my
pleasure
was
very
great
in
discovering
that
the
son
was
a
faithful
member
of
our
mission
and
a
thoroughly
good
man
and
who
is
sallie
ester
inquired
very
much
interested
foster
face
grew
graver
sallie
is
his
one
treasure
a
dear
little
girl
one
of
our
mission
scholars
and
a
beautiful
example
of
how
faithful
christ
can
be
to
his
little
lambs
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
matter
with
sallie
this
question
came
from
ralph
who
had
been
half
amused
half
interested
with
the
entire
scene
the
gravity
on
foster
face
deepened
into
sternness
as
he
answered
sallie
is
only
one
of
the
many
victims
of
our
beautiful
system
of
public
poisoning
the
son
of
her
mother
employer
in
a
fit
of
drunken
rage
threw
her
from
the
very
top
of
a
long
flight
of
stairs
and
now
she
lies
warped
and
misshapen
mourning
her
life
away
by
the
way
he
continued
turning
suddenly
toward
ried
i
believe
you
were
asking
for
arguments
to
sustain
my
views
here
is
one
of
them
this
man
of
whom
i
speak
whose
crazed
brain
has
this
young
sad
life
and
death
to
answer
for
i
chance
to
know
to
a
certainty
commenced
his
downward
career
in
a
certain
pleasant
parlor
in
this
city
among
a
select
gathering
of
friends
taking
a
quiet
glass
of
wine
and
foster
made
his
adieus
very
brief
and
departed
ralph
laugh
was
just
a
little
nervous
as
he
said
when
the
family
were
alone
foster
is
very
fortunate
in
having
an
incident
come
to
our
very
door
with
which
to
point
his
theories
abbie
had
deserted
her
ottoman
and
taken
one
close
by
her
side
now
she
laid
her
bright
head
lovingly
against
his
breast
and
looked
with
eager
coaxing
eyes
into
his
stern
gray
ones
father
she
said
softly
you
let
your
little
curly
have
her
own
way
just
this
time
wo
you
i
will
promise
not
to
coax
you
again
until
i
want
something
very
bad
indeed
ried
had
decided
his
plan
of
action
some
moments
before
he
was
prepared
to
remind
his
daughter
in
tones
of
haughty
dignity
that
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
playing
the
part
of
a
despot
in
his
own
family
and
that
as
she
and
her
future
husband
were
so
very
positive
in
their
very
singular
opinions
and
so
entirely
regardless
of
his
wishes
or
feelings
he
should
of
course
not
force
his
hospitalities
on
her
guests
he
made
one
mistake
for
just
a
moment
he
allowed
his
eyes
to
meet
the
sweet
blue
ones
looking
lovingly
and
trustingly
into
his
and
whatever
it
was
whether
the
remembrance
that
his
one
daughter
was
so
soon
to
go
out
from
her
home
or
the
thought
of
all
the
tender
and
patient
love
and
care
which
she
had
bestowed
on
him
in
those
early
morning
hours
the
stern
gray
eyes
grew
tender
the
haughty
lines
about
the
mouth
relaxed
and
with
a
sudden
caressing
movement
of
his
hand
among
the
brown
curls
he
said
in
a
half
moved
half
playful
tone
did
you
ever
ask
any
thing
of
anybody
in
your
life
that
you
get
then
more
gravely
you
shall
have
your
way
once
more
abbie
it
would
be
a
pity
to
despoil
you
of
your
scepter
at
this
late
day
fiddlesticks
ejaculated
ried
before
she
had
added
anything
to
that
original
sentiment
abbie
was
behind
her
chair
both
arms
wound
around
her
neck
and
then
came
soft
quick
loving
kisses
on
her
cheeks
on
her
lips
on
her
chin
and
even
on
her
nose
nonsense
added
her
mother
then
she
laughed
your
father
would
consent
to
have
the
ceremony
performed
in
the
attic
if
you
should
take
a
fancy
that
the
parlors
are
too
nicely
furnished
to
suit
your
puritanic
views
and
i
do
know
but
i
should
be
just
as
foolish
that
man
has
gained
complete
control
over
her
ried
said
looking
after
abbie
with
a
little
sigh
and
addressing
her
remarks
to
ester
as
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
in
the
further
parlor
he
is
a
fanatic
grows
wilder
and
more
incomprehensible
in
his
whims
every
day
and
bends
abbie
to
his
slightest
wish
my
only
consolation
is
that
he
is
a
man
of
wealth
and
culture
and
indeed
in
every
other
respect
entirely
unexceptionable
a
new
light
dawned
upon
ester
this
was
the
secret
of
strangeness
foster
was
one
of
those
rare
and
wonderful
men
about
whom
one
occasionally
reads
but
almost
never
meets
and
of
course
abbie
being
so
constantly
under
his
influence
was
constantly
led
by
him
very
few
could
expect
to
attain
to
such
a
hight
certainly
she
with
her
social
disadvantages
and
unhelpful
surroundings
must
not
hope
for
it
she
was
rapidly
returning
to
her
former
state
of
there
were
certain
things
to
be
done
for
instance
that
first
chapter
of
john
should
receive
more
close
attention
at
her
next
reading
and
there
were
various
other
duties
which
should
be
taken
up
and
carefully
observed
but
on
the
whole
ester
felt
that
she
had
been
rather
unnecessarily
exercised
and
that
she
must
not
expect
to
be
perfect
and
so
once
more
there
was
raised
a
flag
of
truce
between
her
conscience
and
her
life
chapter
xvii
stepping
between
they
lingered
together
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
abbie
ester
ralph
and
foster
they
had
been
having
a
half
sad
half
merry
talk
it
was
the
evening
before
the
wedding
ere
this
time
abbie
would
have
left
them
and
in
just
a
little
while
the
ocean
would
roll
between
them
ester
drew
a
heavy
sigh
as
she
thought
of
it
all
this
magic
three
weeks
which
had
glowed
in
beauty
for
her
such
as
she
told
herself
her
life
would
never
see
again
were
just
on
the
eve
of
departure
only
two
days
now
before
she
would
carry
that
same
restless
unhappy
heart
back
among
the
clattering
dishes
in
that
pantry
and
at
home
ralph
broke
the
little
moment
of
silence
which
had
fallen
between
them
foster
listen
to
the
sweet
tones
of
that
distant
clock
it
is
the
last
time
that
you
being
a
free
man
will
hear
it
strike
five
unless
i
prove
to
be
an
early
riser
on
the
morrow
which
necessity
will
compel
me
to
become
if
i
tarry
longer
here
at
present
abbie
i
must
be
busy
this
entire
evening
that
funeral
obliged
me
to
defer
some
important
business
matters
that
i
meant
should
have
been
dispatched
early
in
the
day
it
is
possible
that
you
have
been
to
a
funeral
how
you
do
mix
things
ralph
uttered
this
sentence
in
real
or
pretended
horror
why
not
foster
answered
gently
and
added
it
is
true
though
life
and
death
are
very
strangely
mixed
it
was
our
little
girl
sallie
whom
we
laid
to
rest
it
jar
as
some
funerals
would
have
done
one
had
simply
to
remember
that
she
had
reached
home
miss
ester
if
you
will
get
that
package
for
me
i
will
execute
your
commission
with
pleasure
ester
went
away
to
do
his
bidding
and
ralph
promising
to
meet
him
at
the
store
in
an
hour
sauntered
away
and
for
a
few
moments
abbie
and
foster
talked
together
alone
all
of
you
he
said
smiling
as
he
glanced
back
at
the
two
girls
a
few
moments
later
take
care
of
her
ester
until
i
relieve
you
it
will
not
be
long
now
take
care
ester
answered
gaily
you
have
forgotten
the
that
there
may
be
the
cup
and
the
lip
but
he
answered
her
with
an
almost
solemn
gravity
i
never
forget
that
more
worthy
expression
of
the
same
idea
we
know
not
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
but
i
always
remember
with
exceeding
joy
that
god
knows
and
will
lead
us
he
is
graver
than
ten
ministers
ester
said
as
they
turned
from
the
window
come
abbie
let
us
go
up
stairs
it
was
two
hours
later
when
abbie
entered
the
where
ester
awaited
her
and
curled
herself
into
a
small
heap
of
white
muslin
at
ester
feet
there
said
she
with
a
musical
little
laugh
mother
has
sent
me
away
the
measure
of
her
disgust
is
complete
now
dr
downing
is
in
the
and
i
have
been
guilty
of
going
in
to
see
him
imagine
such
a
fearful
breach
of
etiquette
taking
place
in
the
house
of
ried
do
you
know
i
do
quite
know
what
to
do
with
myself
there
is
really
nothing
more
to
busy
myself
about
unless
i
eat
the
wedding
cake
you
do
act
in
the
least
like
a
young
lady
who
is
to
be
married
was
ester
answer
as
she
regarded
her
cousin
with
a
half
amused
half
puzzled
air
do
i
said
abbie
trying
to
look
alarmed
what
i
done
now
i
forever
treading
on
bits
of
propriety
and
crushing
them
it
will
be
a
real
relief
to
me
when
i
am
safely
married
and
can
relapse
into
a
common
mortal
again
why
ester
what
have
i
been
guilty
of
just
now
you
are
not
a
bit
sentimental
are
you
abbie
and
at
this
gravely
put
question
abbie
laugh
rang
out
again
now
do
please
add
that
item
to
the
list
she
said
merrily
ester
is
it
very
important
that
one
should
be
sentimental
on
such
an
occasion
i
wish
you
were
married
i
really
do
so
that
i
might
be
told
just
how
to
conduct
my
self
how
can
you
and
mother
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
perfection
when
it
is
all
new
and
i
really
never
practiced
in
my
life
then
a
change
as
sudden
as
it
was
sweet
flushed
over
abbie
face
the
merry
look
died
out
and
in
its
place
a
gentle
tender
softness
rested
in
the
bright
blue
eyes
and
her
voice
was
low
and
quiet
you
think
my
mood
a
strange
one
i
fancy
dear
ester
almost
unbecoming
in
its
gayety
perhaps
it
is
and
yet
i
feel
it
bright
and
glad
and
happy
the
change
is
a
solemn
one
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
considered
it
long
and
well
i
remember
that
my
new
home
is
to
be
very
near
my
old
one
that
my
brother
will
have
a
patient
faithful
friend
in
foster
and
this
makes
me
feel
more
hopeful
for
him
and
indeed
it
seems
to
me
that
i
feel
like
repeating
lines
have
fallen
unto
me
in
pleasant
places
i
do
not
therefore
affect
a
gravity
that
i
do
not
feel
i
am
gloriously
happy
and
the
strongest
feeling
in
my
heart
is
thankfulness
my
heavenly
father
has
brimmed
my
earthly
cup
so
that
it
seems
to
me
there
is
not
room
in
my
heart
for
another
throb
of
joy
and
so
you
see
ester
what
on
earth
can
be
going
on
down
stairs
have
you
noticed
the
banging
of
doors
and
the
general
confusion
that
reigns
through
the
house
positively
if
i
was
afraid
of
shocking
mother
into
a
fainting
fit
i
would
start
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
suppose
i
go
ester
answered
laughing
inasmuch
as
i
am
not
going
to
be
married
there
can
be
no
harm
in
seeing
what
new
developments
there
are
below
stairs
i
mean
to
go
i
send
you
word
if
it
is
any
thing
very
amazing
and
with
a
laughing
adieu
ester
closed
the
door
on
the
young
and
ran
swiftly
down
stairs
there
did
seem
to
be
a
good
deal
of
confusion
in
the
orderly
household
and
the
very
air
of
the
hall
seemed
to
be
pervaded
with
a
singular
subdued
excitement
voices
of
suppressed
loudness
issued
from
the
front
parlor
and
as
ester
knocked
she
heard
a
half
scream
from
ried
mingled
with
cries
of
do
let
her
in
growing
thoroughly
alarmed
ester
now
abruptly
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
oh
for
mercy
sake
do
let
her
come
almost
screamed
ried
starting
wildly
forward
mother
said
ralph
voice
in
solemn
sternness
it
is
only
ester
where
is
abbie
in
her
room
what
is
the
matter
why
do
you
all
act
so
strangely
i
came
to
see
what
caused
so
much
noise
and
then
her
eyes
and
voice
were
arrested
by
a
group
around
the
sofa
ried
and
dr
downing
and
stooping
over
some
object
which
was
hidden
from
her
was
the
man
who
had
been
pointed
out
to
her
as
the
great
archer
as
she
looked
in
terrified
amazement
he
raised
his
head
and
spoke
it
is
as
i
feared
ried
the
pulse
has
ceased
it
is
not
possible
and
the
hollow
awestruck
tone
in
which
ried
spoke
can
not
be
described
and
then
ester
saw
stretched
on
that
sofa
a
perfectly
motionless
form
a
perfectly
pale
and
quiet
face
rapidly
settling
into
the
strange
solemn
calm
of
death
and
that
face
and
form
were
foster
and
she
stood
as
if
riveted
to
the
spot
stood
in
speechless
moveless
horror
and
amaze
and
then
the
thoughts
shaped
themselves
into
two
words
oh
abbie
what
a
household
was
this
into
which
death
had
so
swiftly
and
silently
entered
the
very
rooms
in
which
the
quiet
form
lay
sleeping
all
decked
in
festive
beauty
in
honor
of
the
bridal
morning
but
oh
there
was
to
come
no
bridal
ester
shrank
back
in
awful
terror
from
the
petition
that
she
would
go
to
abbie
i
can
not
i
she
repeated
again
and
again
it
will
kill
her
and
oh
it
would
kill
me
to
tell
her
ried
was
even
more
hopeless
a
dependence
than
ester
and
ried
cried
out
in
the
very
agony
of
despair
what
we
do
is
there
to
help
us
then
ralph
came
forward
grave
almost
to
sternness
but
very
calm
dr
downing
he
said
addressing
the
gentleman
who
had
withdrawn
a
little
from
the
family
group
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
our
only
hope
in
this
time
of
trial
my
sister
and
you
are
sustained
i
verily
believe
by
the
same
power
the
rest
of
us
seem
to
no
sustaining
power
would
you
go
to
my
sister
sir
dr
downing
turned
his
eyes
slowly
away
from
the
calm
moveless
face
which
seemed
to
have
fascinated
him
and
said
simply
i
will
do
what
i
can
for
abbie
it
is
blessed
to
think
what
a
helper
she
has
one
who
never
faileth
god
pity
those
who
have
no
such
friend
so
they
showed
him
up
to
the
library
and
sent
a
message
to
the
unconscious
abbie
dr
downing
she
said
turning
briskly
from
the
window
in
answer
to
maggie
summons
whatever
does
he
want
of
me
do
you
suppose
maggie
i
half
afraid
of
him
tonight
however
i
endeavor
to
brave
the
ordeal
tell
miss
ester
to
come
up
to
me
as
soon
as
she
can
and
be
ready
to
defend
me
if
i
am
to
receive
a
lecture
this
as
she
flitted
by
toward
the
door
and
a
pitying
cloud
just
then
hid
the
face
of
the
august
moon
and
vailed
from
the
glance
of
the
poor
young
creature
the
white
frightened
face
of
maggie
with
what
unutterable
agony
of
fear
did
the
family
below
wait
and
long
for
and
dread
the
return
of
dr
downing
or
some
message
from
that
dreadful
room
the
moments
that
seemed
hours
to
them
dragged
on
and
no
sound
came
to
them
she
has
not
fainted
then
muttered
ralph
at
last
or
he
would
have
rung
ester
you
know
what
maggie
said
could
you
not
go
to
her
ester
cowered
and
shrunk
oh
ralph
do
ask
me
i
then
they
waited
again
in
silence
and
at
last
shivered
with
fear
as
dr
downing
softly
opened
the
door
there
were
traces
of
deep
emotion
on
his
face
but
just
now
it
was
wonderful
for
its
calmness
she
knows
all
he
said
addressing
ried
and
the
widow
god
is
hers
ried
she
makes
special
request
that
she
need
see
no
living
soul
and
indeed
i
think
it
will
be
best
and
now
my
friends
may
i
pray
with
you
in
this
hour
of
trial
so
while
quick
skillful
fingers
prepared
the
sleeper
in
that
front
parlor
for
his
long
long
rest
a
group
such
as
had
never
bowed
the
knee
together
before
knelt
in
the
room
just
across
the
hall
and
amid
tears
and
moans
they
were
commended
to
the
care
of
him
who
waits
to
help
us
all
by
and
by
a
solemn
quiet
settled
down
upon
that
strangely
stricken
household
in
the
front
parlor
the
folding
doors
were
closed
and
the
angel
of
death
kept
guard
over
his
quiet
victim
from
the
chamber
overhead
came
forth
no
sound
and
none
knew
save
god
how
fared
the
struggle
between
despair
and
submission
in
that
young
heart
in
the
ester
waited
breathlessly
while
ralph
gave
the
particulars
which
she
had
not
until
now
been
able
to
hear
we
were
crossing
just
above
the
store
had
nearly
got
across
he
was
just
saying
that
his
preparations
were
entirely
perfected
for
a
long
absence
is
a
long
journey
he
added
if
i
never
come
back
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
i
have
left
everything
ready
even
for
that
it
is
well
to
be
ready
even
for
death
ralph
he
said
with
one
of
his
glorious
smiles
makes
life
pleasanter
i
know
how
i
can
tell
you
the
rest
and
ralph
lips
grew
white
and
tremulous
indeed
i
hardly
know
how
it
was
there
was
an
old
bent
woman
crossing
just
behind
us
and
there
was
a
carriage
and
a
wretch
of
a
drunken
driver
pushing
his
way
through
i
do
know
how
foster
came
to
look
around
but
he
did
and
said
is
my
dear
old
lady
behind
us
ralph
she
ought
not
to
be
out
with
a
mere
child
for
a
companion
and
then
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
terror
and
sprang
forward
and
i
know
nothing
clearly
that
followed
i
saw
him
drag
that
old
woman
fairly
from
under
the
horses
feet
i
heard
the
driver
curse
and
saw
him
strike
his
frightened
horses
and
they
reared
and
plunged
and
i
saw
him
fall
but
it
all
seemed
to
happen
in
one
second
of
time
and
how
i
got
him
home
and
got
archer
and
kept
it
from
abbie
i
do
seem
to
know
oh
god
help
my
poor
little
fair
darling
and
ralph
choked
and
stopped
and
wiped
from
his
eyes
great
burning
tears
oh
ralph
said
ester
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
then
all
this
misery
comes
because
that
driver
was
intoxicated
yes
said
ralph
with
compressed
lips
and
flashing
eyes
and
that
knowing
the
time
that
now
it
is
high
time
to
awake
out
of
sleep
for
now
is
our
salvation
nearer
than
when
we
believed
rom
chapter
xviii
light
out
of
darkness
slowly
slowly
the
night
wore
away
and
the
eastern
sky
grew
rosy
with
the
blush
of
a
new
morning
the
bridal
morning
how
strangely
unreal
how
even
impossible
did
it
seem
to
ester
as
she
raised
the
curtains
and
looked
drearily
out
upon
the
dawn
that
this
was
actually
the
day
upon
which
her
thoughts
had
centered
during
the
last
three
weeks
what
a
sudden
shutting
down
had
there
been
to
all
their
plans
and
preparations
how
strangely
the
house
looked
here
a
room
bedecked
in
festive
beauty
for
the
wedding
there
one
with
shrouded
mirrors
and
floating
folds
of
crape
life
and
death
a
wedding
and
a
funeral
they
had
never
either
of
them
touched
so
close
to
her
before
and
now
the
one
had
suddenly
glided
backward
and
left
her
heart
heavy
with
the
coming
of
the
other
mechanically
she
turned
to
look
upon
the
silvery
garment
gleaming
among
the
white
furnishings
of
the
bed
for
she
was
that
very
morning
to
have
assisted
in
arraying
the
bride
in
those
robes
of
beauty
her
own
careful
fingers
had
laid
out
all
the
bewildering
paraphernalia
of
the
sash
and
gloves
and
handkerchief
and
laces
just
in
that
very
spot
had
she
stood
only
yesterday
and
talking
the
while
with
abbie
had
altered
a
knot
of
ribbons
and
given
the
ends
a
more
graceful
droop
and
just
at
that
moment
abbie
had
been
summoned
below
stairs
to
see
foster
and
now
he
was
waiting
down
there
not
for
abbie
but
for
the
coffin
and
the
grave
and
abbie
was
and
here
ester
gave
a
low
shuddering
moan
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
why
had
she
come
into
that
room
at
all
and
why
was
all
this
fearful
time
allowed
to
come
to
abbie
poor
poor
abbie
she
had
been
so
bright
and
so
good
and
foster
had
been
so
entirely
her
guide
how
could
she
ever
endure
it
ester
doubted
much
whether
abbie
could
ever
bear
to
see
again
she
had
been
so
closely
connected
with
all
these
bright
days
over
which
so
fearful
a
pall
had
fallen
it
would
be
very
natural
if
she
should
refuse
even
to
her
and
indeed
ester
almost
hoped
she
would
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
was
a
woe
too
deep
to
be
spoken
of
or
endured
only
she
said
with
a
kind
of
desperation
things
be
endured
and
there
was
a
wild
thought
in
her
heart
that
if
she
could
but
have
the
ordering
of
events
all
this
bitter
sorrow
should
never
be
there
came
a
low
tremulous
knock
as
an
interruption
to
her
thoughts
and
maggie
swollen
eyes
and
face
appeared
at
the
door
with
a
message
if
you
please
miss
ester
she
wants
you
who
asked
ester
with
trembling
lips
and
a
sinking
at
her
heart
miss
abbie
she
asked
for
you
and
said
would
you
come
to
her
as
soon
as
you
could
but
it
was
hours
after
that
before
ester
brought
herself
to
feel
that
she
go
to
her
nothing
had
ever
seemed
so
hard
to
her
to
do
how
to
look
how
to
act
what
to
say
and
above
all
what
to
say
to
this
poor
widowed
bride
these
questions
were
by
no
means
answered
when
she
suddenly
in
desperate
haste
decided
that
if
it
must
be
done
the
sooner
it
was
over
the
better
and
she
made
all
speed
to
prepare
herself
for
the
visit
and
yet
there
was
enough
of
ester
personal
self
left
even
on
that
morning
to
send
a
little
quiver
of
complacency
through
her
veins
as
she
bathed
her
face
and
smoothed
her
disordered
hair
abbie
had
sent
for
abbie
wanted
her
she
had
sent
twice
evidently
she
had
turned
to
her
for
help
miserably
unable
as
she
felt
herself
to
give
it
still
it
was
a
comfort
to
feel
that
she
was
the
one
selected
from
the
household
for
companionship
ester
knew
that
ried
had
been
with
her
daughter
for
a
few
moments
and
that
ralph
had
rushed
in
and
out
again
too
overcome
to
stay
but
ester
had
asked
no
questions
and
received
no
information
concerning
her
she
pictured
her
lying
on
the
bed
with
disordered
hair
and
swollen
eyes
given
over
to
the
abandonment
of
grief
or
else
the
image
of
stony
despair
and
it
was
with
a
very
trembling
hand
that
at
last
she
softly
turned
the
knob
and
let
herself
into
the
morning
room
which
she
and
abbie
had
enjoyed
together
and
just
as
she
pushed
open
the
door
a
neighboring
clock
counted
out
twelve
strokes
and
it
was
at
twelve
that
abbie
was
to
become
a
wife
midway
in
the
room
ester
paused
and
as
her
eyes
rested
on
abbie
a
look
of
bewildering
astonishment
gathered
on
her
face
in
the
little
easy
chair
by
the
open
window
one
hand
keeping
the
place
in
the
partly
closed
book
sat
the
young
creature
whose
life
had
so
suddenly
darkened
around
her
the
morning
robe
of
soft
pure
white
was
perfect
in
its
neatness
and
simplicity
the
brown
curls
clustered
around
her
brow
with
their
wonted
grace
and
beauty
and
while
under
her
eyes
indeed
there
were
heavy
rings
of
black
yet
the
eyes
themselves
were
large
and
full
and
tender
as
she
held
out
the
disengaged
hand
there
came
the
soft
and
gentle
likeness
of
a
smile
over
her
face
and
ester
bewildered
amazed
frightened
stood
almost
as
transfixed
as
if
she
had
been
one
of
those
who
saw
the
angel
sitting
at
the
door
of
the
empty
tomb
stood
a
moment
then
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
overcoming
her
hurried
forward
and
dropping
on
her
knees
bowed
her
head
over
the
white
hand
and
the
bible
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
ester
this
said
abbie
in
the
softest
most
soothing
of
tones
the
mourner
turned
comforter
oh
abbie
abbie
how
can
you
bear
it
how
you
live
burst
forth
from
the
heart
of
this
friend
who
had
come
to
comfort
this
afflicted
one
there
was
a
little
bit
of
silence
now
and
a
touching
tremble
to
the
voice
when
it
was
heard
again
lord
knoweth
them
that
are
his
i
try
to
remember
that
christ
knows
it
all
and
he
loves
me
and
he
is
and
yet
he
leads
me
through
this
dark
road
therefore
it
be
right
but
said
ester
raising
her
eyes
and
staying
her
tears
for
very
amazement
i
do
not
understand
i
do
not
see
how
you
be
so
calm
so
submissive
at
least
just
now
so
soon
and
you
were
to
have
been
married
the
blood
rolled
in
great
purple
waves
over
neck
and
cheek
and
brow
and
then
receded
leaving
a
strange
almost
pallor
behind
it
the
small
hands
were
tightly
clasped
with
a
strange
mixture
of
pain
and
devotion
in
the
movement
and
the
white
lips
moved
for
a
moment
forming
words
that
met
no
mortal
ear
then
the
sweet
low
tender
voice
sounded
again
dear
ester
i
pray
there
is
no
other
way
i
pray
all
the
time
i
keep
right
by
my
savior
there
is
just
a
little
oh
a
very
little
vale
of
flesh
between
him
and
between
my
my
husband
and
myself
jesus
loves
me
ester
i
know
it
now
just
as
well
as
i
did
yesterday
i
do
not
and
can
not
doubt
him
a
mixture
of
awe
and
pain
and
astonishment
kept
ester
moveless
and
silent
and
abbie
spoke
no
more
for
some
moments
then
it
was
a
changed
almost
bright
voice
ester
do
you
remember
we
stood
together
alone
for
a
moment
yesterday
i
will
tell
you
what
he
said
the
last
words
that
were
intended
for
just
me
only
that
i
shall
hear
for
a
little
while
they
are
words
you
know
but
i
shall
tell
them
to
you
so
you
may
see
how
tender
christ
is
even
in
his
most
solemn
chastenings
here
he
said
will
give
you
a
word
to
keep
until
we
meet
in
the
morning
the
lord
watch
between
thee
and
me
while
we
are
absent
one
from
another
i
have
been
thinking
while
i
sat
here
this
morning
watching
the
coming
of
this
new
day
which
you
know
is
his
first
day
in
heaven
that
perhaps
it
will
be
on
some
such
morning
of
beauty
as
this
that
my
long
long
day
will
dawn
and
that
i
will
say
to
him
as
soon
as
ever
i
see
his
face
again
word
was
a
good
one
the
lord
has
watched
between
us
and
the
night
is
gone
think
of
it
ester
i
shall
say
that
some
day
summer
morning
the
essence
of
sweetness
and
the
sublimity
of
faith
which
this
young
christian
threw
into
these
jubilant
words
can
not
be
repeated
on
paper
but
thank
god
they
can
in
the
heart
they
are
but
the
echo
of
those
sure
and
everlasting
words
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
thee
as
for
ester
who
had
spent
her
years
groveling
in
the
dust
of
earth
it
was
the
recital
of
such
an
experience
as
she
had
not
deemed
it
possible
for
humanity
to
reach
and
still
she
knelt
immovable
and
silent
and
abbie
broke
the
silence
yet
again
dear
ester
do
you
know
i
have
not
seen
him
yet
and
i
want
to
mother
does
not
understand
and
she
would
not
give
her
consent
but
she
thinks
me
safe
while
you
are
with
me
would
you
mind
going
down
with
me
just
to
look
at
his
face
again
oh
ester
would
mind
it
she
was
actually
afraid
of
death
she
was
afraid
of
the
effect
of
such
a
scene
upon
this
strange
abbie
she
raised
her
head
shivering
with
pain
and
apprehension
and
looked
a
volume
of
petition
and
remonstrance
but
ere
she
spoke
abbie
hand
rested
lovingly
on
her
arm
and
her
low
sweet
voice
continued
the
pleading
you
do
not
quite
understand
my
mood
ester
i
am
not
unlike
others
i
have
wept
bitter
tears
this
past
night
i
have
groaned
in
agony
of
spirit
i
have
moaned
in
the
very
dust
i
shall
doubtless
have
such
struggles
again
this
is
earth
and
the
flesh
is
weak
but
now
is
my
hour
of
exaltation
and
while
it
is
given
me
now
to
feel
a
faint
overshadowing
of
the
very
glory
which
surrounds
him
i
want
to
go
and
look
my
last
upon
the
dear
clay
which
is
to
stay
here
on
earth
with
me
and
ester
rose
up
and
wound
her
arm
about
the
tiny
frame
which
held
this
brave
true
heart
and
without
another
spoken
word
the
two
went
swiftly
down
the
stairs
and
entered
the
silent
solemn
parlor
yet
even
while
she
went
a
fierce
throb
of
pain
shook
ester
heart
as
she
remembered
how
they
had
arranged
to
descend
the
staircase
on
this
very
day
in
what
a
different
manner
and
for
what
a
different
purpose
apparently
no
such
thought
as
this
touched
abbie
she
went
softly
and
yet
swiftly
forward
to
the
still
form
while
ester
waited
in
almost
breathless
agony
to
see
what
would
result
from
this
trial
of
faith
and
nerve
but
what
a
face
it
was
upon
which
death
had
left
its
seal
no
sculptured
marble
was
ever
so
grand
in
its
solemn
beauty
as
was
this
face
upon
which
the
glorious
smile
born
not
of
earth
rested
in
full
sweetness
abbie
with
clasped
hands
and
slightly
parted
lips
stood
and
almost
literally
drank
in
the
smile
then
sweet
and
low
and
musical
there
broke
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
that
great
solemn
room
so
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
not
another
word
or
sound
disturbed
the
silence
and
still
abbie
stood
and
gazed
on
the
dear
dead
face
and
still
ester
stood
near
the
door
and
watched
with
alternations
of
anxiety
and
awe
the
changeful
expressions
on
the
scarcely
less
white
face
of
the
living
until
at
last
without
sound
or
word
she
dropped
upon
her
knees
a
cloud
of
white
drapery
floating
around
her
and
clasped
her
hands
over
the
lifeless
breast
then
on
ester
face
the
anxiety
gave
place
to
awe
and
with
softly
moving
fingers
she
opened
the
door
and
with
noiseless
tread
went
out
into
the
hall
and
left
the
living
and
the
dead
alone
together
there
was
one
more
scene
for
ester
to
endure
that
day
late
in
the
afternoon
as
she
went
to
the
closed
room
there
was
bending
over
the
manly
form
a
old
woman
by
whose
friendly
hands
she
had
been
permitted
to
enter
ester
did
not
stop
to
wonder
she
had
seen
her
but
once
before
but
she
knew
at
a
glance
the
worn
wrinkled
face
and
as
if
a
picture
of
the
scene
hung
before
her
she
saw
that
old
queer
form
leaning
trustfully
on
the
strong
arm
lying
nerveless
now
being
carefully
helped
through
the
pushing
throng
being
reverently
cared
for
as
if
she
had
been
his
mother
and
looking
after
the
two
had
wondered
if
she
should
ever
see
them
again
now
she
stood
in
the
presence
of
them
both
yet
what
an
unmeasurable
ocean
rolled
between
them
the
faded
tearful
eyes
were
raised
to
her
face
after
a
moment
and
a
quivering
voice
spoke
her
thoughts
aloud
rather
than
addressed
any
body
he
gave
his
life
for
poor
old
useless
me
and
it
was
such
a
beautiful
life
and
was
needed
oh
so
much
but
what
am
i
saying
god
let
it
be
him
instead
of
me
who
wanted
so
to
go
and
after
trusting
him
all
along
am
i
at
my
time
of
life
going
to
murmur
at
him
now
he
came
to
see
me
only
yesterday
this
in
a
more
natural
tone
of
voice
addressed
to
ester
he
told
me
he
said
he
was
going
a
long
journey
with
his
wife
and
now
may
the
dear
savior
help
the
poor
darling
for
he
has
gone
his
long
journey
without
her
ester
waited
to
hear
not
another
word
the
heavy
sense
of
pain
because
of
abbie
which
she
had
carried
about
with
her
through
all
that
weary
day
had
reached
its
height
with
that
last
sentence
he
has
gone
his
long
journey
without
her
she
fled
from
the
room
up
the
stairs
to
the
quiet
little
chamber
which
had
been
given
to
her
for
her
hours
of
retirement
locked
and
bolted
the
door
and
commenced
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
in
agony
of
soul
it
was
not
all
because
of
abbie
that
this
pain
knocked
so
steadily
at
her
heart
at
least
not
all
out
of
sympathy
with
her
bitter
sorrow
there
was
a
fearful
tumult
raging
in
her
own
soul
her
last
stronghold
had
been
shattered
of
late
she
had
come
to
think
that
christian
life
was
but
a
sweet
reflection
of
foster
strong
true
soul
that
she
leaned
not
on
christ
but
on
the
arm
of
flesh
she
had
told
herself
very
confidently
that
if
had
such
a
friend
as
he
had
been
to
abbie
she
should
be
like
her
in
her
hours
of
rebellion
she
had
almost
angrily
reminded
herself
that
it
was
not
strange
that
abbie
life
could
be
so
free
from
blame
had
some
one
to
turn
to
in
her
needs
it
was
a
very
easy
matter
for
abbie
to
slip
lightly
over
the
petty
trials
of
her
life
so
long
as
she
was
surrounded
and
shielded
by
that
strong
true
love
but
now
ah
now
the
arm
of
flesh
had
faltered
the
strong
staff
had
broken
and
broken
too
only
a
moment
as
it
were
before
it
was
to
have
been
hers
in
name
as
well
as
in
spirit
naturally
ester
had
expected
that
the
young
creature
so
suddenly
shorn
of
her
best
and
dearest
would
falter
and
faint
and
utterly
fail
and
when
looking
on
she
saw
the
triumph
of
the
christian
faith
rising
even
over
death
sustained
by
no
human
arm
and
yet
wonderfully
triumphantly
sustained
even
while
she
bent
for
the
last
time
over
that
which
was
to
have
been
her
earthly
all
looking
and
wondering
there
suddenly
fell
away
from
her
the
stupor
of
years
and
ester
saw
with
wide
open
eyes
and
thoroughly
awakened
soul
that
there
was
a
something
in
this
christian
religion
that
abbie
had
and
she
had
not
and
thus
it
was
that
she
paced
her
room
in
that
strange
agony
that
was
worse
than
grief
and
more
sharp
than
despair
no
use
now
to
try
to
lull
her
conscience
back
to
quiet
sleep
again
that
time
was
past
it
was
thoroughly
and
sharply
awake
the
same
hand
which
had
tenderly
freed
one
soul
from
its
bonds
of
clay
and
called
it
home
had
as
tenderly
and
as
wisely
with
the
same
stroke
cut
the
cords
that
bound
this
other
soul
to
earth
loosed
the
scales
from
her
eyes
broke
the
sleep
that
had
lulled
her
to
ruin
and
now
heart
and
brain
and
conscience
were
thoroughly
and
forever
awake
when
at
last
from
sheer
exhaustion
she
ceased
her
excited
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
and
sank
into
a
chair
her
heart
was
not
more
stilled
it
seemed
to
her
long
after
in
thinking
of
this
hour
that
it
was
given
to
her
to
see
deeper
into
the
recesses
of
her
own
depravity
than
ever
mortal
had
seen
before
she
began
years
back
at
that
time
when
she
thought
she
had
given
her
heart
to
christ
and
reviewed
step
by
step
all
the
weary
way
up
to
this
present
time
and
she
found
nothing
but
backslidings
and
inconsistencies
and
confusion
denials
of
her
savior
a
closed
bible
a
neglected
closet
a
forgotten
cross
oh
the
bitterness
the
unutterable
agony
of
that
hour
surely
abbie
on
her
knees
struggling
with
her
bleeding
heart
and
yet
feeling
all
around
and
underneath
her
the
everlasting
arms
knew
nothing
of
desolation
such
as
this
fiercer
and
fiercer
waged
the
warfare
until
at
last
every
root
of
pride
or
or
was
utterly
cast
out
yet
did
not
satan
despair
oh
he
meant
to
have
this
poor
sick
weak
lamb
if
he
could
get
her
no
effort
should
be
left
unmade
and
when
he
found
that
she
could
be
no
more
coaxed
and
lulled
and
petted
into
peace
he
tried
that
darker
heavier
temptation
tried
to
stupefy
her
into
absolute
despair
no
she
said
within
her
heart
i
am
not
a
christian
i
never
have
been
one
i
never
be
one
i
been
a
miserable
hypocrite
all
my
life
i
have
had
a
name
to
live
and
am
dead
i
would
not
let
myself
be
awakened
i
have
struggled
against
it
i
have
been
only
too
glad
to
stop
myself
from
thinking
about
it
i
have
been
just
a
miserable
with
no
excuse
to
offer
and
now
i
feel
myself
deserted
justly
so
there
can
be
no
rest
for
such
as
i
have
no
savior
i
have
insulted
and
denied
him
i
have
crucified
him
again
and
now
he
has
left
me
to
myself
thus
did
that
father
of
lies
continue
to
pour
into
this
weary
soul
the
same
old
story
which
he
has
repeated
for
so
many
hundred
years
with
the
same
old
foundation
i
and
strange
to
say
this
poor
girl
repeated
the
experience
which
has
so
many
times
been
lived
during
these
past
hundreds
of
years
in
the
very
face
of
that
other
glorious
pronoun
in
very
defiance
it
would
seem
to
that
old
old
explanation
surely
hath
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
and
with
we
are
healed
yes
ester
knew
those
two
verses
she
knew
yet
another
which
said
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
and
yet
she
dared
to
sit
with
hopeless
folded
hand
with
heavy
despairing
eyes
and
repeat
that
sentence
i
no
savior
now
and
many
a
wandering
sheep
has
dared
even
in
its
repenting
hour
to
insult
the
great
shepherd
thus
ester
bible
lay
on
the
window
seat
the
large
somewhat
worn
bible
which
abbie
had
lent
her
to
mark
just
as
much
as
she
pleased
it
lay
open
as
if
it
had
opened
of
itself
to
a
familiar
spot
there
were
heavy
markings
around
several
of
the
verses
markings
that
had
not
been
made
by
ester
pencil
some
power
far
removed
from
that
which
had
been
guiding
her
despairing
thoughts
prompted
her
to
reach
forth
her
hand
for
the
book
and
fix
her
attention
on
those
marked
verses
and
the
words
were
these
for
thus
saith
the
high
and
lofty
one
that
inhabiteth
eternity
whose
name
is
holy
i
dwell
in
the
high
and
holy
place
with
him
also
that
is
of
a
contrite
and
humble
spirit
to
revive
the
spirit
of
the
humble
and
to
revive
the
heart
of
the
contrite
ones
for
i
will
not
contend
forever
neither
will
i
be
always
wroth
for
the
spirit
should
fail
before
me
and
the
souls
which
i
have
made
for
the
iniquity
of
his
covetousness
was
i
wroth
and
smote
him
i
hid
me
and
was
wroth
and
he
went
on
frowardly
in
the
way
of
his
heart
i
have
seen
his
ways
and
will
heal
him
i
will
lead
him
also
and
restore
comforts
unto
him
and
to
his
mourners
i
create
the
fruit
of
the
lips
peace
peace
to
him
that
is
afar
off
and
to
him
that
is
near
saith
the
lord
and
will
heal
had
an
angel
spoken
to
ester
or
was
it
the
dear
voice
of
the
lord
himself
she
did
not
know
she
only
knew
that
there
rang
through
her
very
soul
two
sentences
as
the
climax
of
all
these
wonderful
words
peace
peace
to
him
that
is
afar
off
and
i
will
heal
him
a
moment
more
and
with
the
very
promise
of
the
crucified
spread
out
before
her
ester
was
on
her
knees
and
at
first
with
bursts
of
passionate
tearful
pleading
and
later
with
low
humble
contrite
tones
and
finally
with
the
sound
in
her
voice
of
that
peace
which
comes
only
to
those
to
whom
christ
is
repeating
i
have
blotted
out
as
a
cloud
thy
transgressions
and
as
a
thick
cloud
thy
sins
did
ester
pray
do
you
know
dear
ester
there
must
have
been
two
new
joys
in
heaven
first
they
had
a
among
those
who
walk
with
him
in
white
for
they
are
worthy
and
then
they
had
that
shout
of
triumph
over
another
soul
for
whom
satan
has
struggled
fiercely
and
whom
he
has
forever
lost
this
said
abbie
as
they
nestled
close
together
that
evening
in
the
purple
twilight
and
ester
answered
simply
and
softly
amen
chapter
xix
sundries
meanwhile
the
days
moved
on
the
time
fixed
for
ester
return
home
had
long
passed
and
yet
she
tarried
in
new
york
abbie
clung
to
her
wanted
her
for
various
reasons
and
the
unselfish
pitying
mother
far
away
full
of
tender
sympathy
for
the
stricken
bride
smothered
a
sigh
of
weariness
buried
in
her
heart
the
thought
of
her
own
need
of
her
eldest
daughter
presence
and
help
and
wrote
a
long
loving
letter
jointly
to
the
daughter
and
niece
wherein
she
gave
her
full
consent
to
ester
remaining
away
so
long
as
she
could
be
a
comfort
to
her
cousin
two
items
worthy
of
record
occurred
during
these
days
the
first
time
the
family
gathered
at
the
dinner
table
after
the
one
who
had
been
so
nearly
a
son
of
the
house
had
been
carried
to
his
rest
in
that
wonderful
and
treasured
city
of
greenwood
ralph
being
helped
by
john
as
usual
to
his
glass
of
wine
refused
it
with
a
short
sharp
almost
angry
take
it
away
and
never
offer
me
the
accursed
stuff
again
we
should
have
had
him
with
us
but
for
that
i
never
touch
another
drop
of
it
as
long
as
i
live
which
startling
words
and
ried
listened
to
without
comment
other
than
a
look
bestowed
on
abbie
to
see
how
she
would
bear
this
mention
of
her
dead
and
she
bore
it
this
way
turning
her
eyes
glistening
with
tears
full
on
her
brother
face
she
said
with
a
little
quiver
of
tender
gladness
in
her
voice
oh
ralph
i
knew
it
had
a
silver
lining
but
i
did
not
think
god
would
let
me
see
it
so
soon
then
and
ried
concluded
that
both
their
children
were
queer
and
that
they
did
not
understand
them
the
other
item
was
productive
of
a
dissertation
on
propriety
from
ried
ralph
and
his
father
were
in
the
back
parlor
the
former
standing
with
one
arm
resting
on
the
mantel
while
he
talked
with
his
father
who
was
half
buried
in
a
great
easy
chair
that
easy
chair
in
his
own
elegant
parlor
and
his
handsome
son
standing
before
him
in
that
graceful
attitude
were
ried
synonyms
for
perfect
satisfaction
and
his
face
took
on
a
little
frown
of
disappointment
as
the
door
opened
somewhat
noisily
and
ried
came
in
wearing
a
look
expressive
of
vexation
ralph
paused
in
the
midst
of
his
sentence
and
wheeled
forward
a
second
easy
chair
for
his
mother
then
returned
to
his
former
position
and
waited
patiently
for
the
gathered
frown
to
break
into
words
which
event
instantly
occurred
i
really
do
not
think
ried
that
this
nonsense
ought
to
be
allowed
besides
being
a
very
strange
unfeeling
thing
to
do
it
is
in
my
opinion
positively
indecent
and
i
think
ried
that
you
ought
to
exercise
your
authority
for
once
if
you
would
kindly
inform
me
what
you
are
supposed
to
be
talking
about
and
where
my
authority
is
specially
needed
at
this
time
i
might
be
induced
to
consider
the
matter
this
from
the
depths
of
the
easy
chair
in
its
owner
most
provokingly
indifferent
tone
which
fortunately
ried
was
too
much
preoccupied
to
take
special
note
of
and
continued
her
storm
of
words
here
it
is
not
actually
quite
a
week
since
he
was
buried
and
abbie
must
needs
make
herself
and
her
family
appear
perfectly
ridiculous
by
making
her
advent
in
public
ried
came
to
an
upright
posture
and
even
ralph
asked
a
startled
question
where
is
she
going
why
where
do
you
suppose
but
to
that
absurd
little
where
she
always
would
insist
upon
going
every
thursday
evening
i
used
to
think
it
was
for
the
pleasure
of
a
walk
home
with
foster
but
why
she
should
go
is
incomprehensible
to
me
nonsense
said
ried
settling
back
into
the
cushions
a
large
public
that
will
be
i
thought
at
the
very
least
she
was
going
to
the
opera
if
the
child
finds
any
comfort
in
such
an
atmosphere
the
harm
let
her
go
where
the
harm
now
ried
that
is
just
as
much
as
you
care
for
appearances
and
at
other
times
you
can
be
quite
as
particular
as
am
though
i
certainly
believe
there
is
nothing
that
abbie
might
take
a
fancy
to
do
that
you
would
not
uphold
her
in
ried
reply
was
uttered
in
a
tone
that
impressed
one
with
the
belief
that
he
was
uttering
a
deliberate
conviction
you
are
quite
right
as
regards
that
i
suspect
at
least
i
find
myself
quite
unable
to
conceive
of
any
thing
connected
with
her
that
could
by
any
twisting
be
made
other
than
just
the
thing
ried
exasperated
answer
was
cut
short
by
the
entrance
of
abbie
attired
as
for
a
walk
or
ride
the
extreme
pallor
of
her
face
and
the
largeness
of
her
soft
eyes
enhanced
by
the
deep
mourning
robes
which
fell
around
her
like
the
night
now
abbie
said
ried
turning
promptly
to
her
i
did
hope
you
had
given
up
this
strangest
of
all
your
strange
whims
what
people
think
people
are
quite
accustomed
to
see
me
there
dear
mother
at
least
all
the
people
who
will
see
me
and
if
i
needed
help
i
do
just
now
i
should
think
it
would
be
much
more
appropriate
to
stay
at
home
and
find
help
in
the
society
of
your
own
family
that
is
the
way
other
people
do
who
are
in
affliction
ried
had
the
benefit
of
a
full
steady
look
from
abbie
great
solemn
eyes
now
as
she
said
mother
i
want
god
help
no
other
will
do
me
any
good
well
answered
ried
after
just
a
moment
of
rather
silence
ca
you
find
that
help
any
where
but
in
that
plain
common
little
i
thought
people
with
your
peculiar
views
believed
that
god
was
an
expression
not
unlike
that
of
a
hunted
deer
shone
for
a
moment
in
abbie
eyes
then
she
spoke
in
tones
almost
despairing
o
mother
you
understand
tone
or
words
or
both
vexed
ried
afresh
and
she
spoke
with
added
sharpness
at
least
i
can
understand
this
much
that
my
daughter
is
very
anxious
to
do
a
thing
utterly
unheard
of
in
its
propriety
and
i
am
thoroughly
ashamed
of
you
if
i
were
ester
i
should
not
like
to
uphold
you
in
such
a
singularly
conspicuous
parade
remember
you
have
no
one
but
john
to
depend
upon
as
an
escort
ralph
had
remained
a
silent
immovable
listener
to
this
strange
sad
conversation
up
to
this
moment
now
he
came
suddenly
forward
with
a
quick
firm
tread
and
encircled
abbie
trembling
form
with
his
arm
while
with
eyes
and
voice
he
addressed
his
mother
in
that
last
proposition
you
are
quite
mistaken
my
dear
mother
abbie
chances
to
have
a
brother
who
considers
himself
honored
by
being
permitted
to
accompany
her
any
where
she
may
choose
to
go
ried
looked
up
at
her
tall
haughty
son
in
unfeigned
astonishment
and
for
an
instant
was
silent
oh
she
said
at
last
if
you
have
chosen
to
rank
yourself
on
this
ridiculous
fanatical
side
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
as
for
ried
he
had
long
before
this
shadded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
was
looking
through
fingers
with
mournful
eyes
at
the
sable
robes
and
pallid
face
of
his
darling
apparently
utterly
unconscious
of
or
indifferent
to
the
talk
that
was
going
on
but
will
ralph
ever
forget
the
little
sweet
smile
which
illumined
for
a
moment
the
pure
young
face
as
she
turned
confiding
eyes
on
him
thenceforth
there
dawned
a
new
era
in
abbie
life
ralph
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
chose
to
be
released
from
his
vacation
engagements
in
a
neighboring
city
and
remained
closely
at
home
and
abbie
went
as
usual
to
her
to
her
to
the
teacher
to
the
regular
church
she
had
been
wont
to
go
and
she
was
always
and
accompanied
and
sustained
by
her
brother
as
for
ester
these
were
days
of
great
opportunity
and
spiritual
growth
to
her
so
we
bridge
the
weeks
between
and
reach
the
afternoon
of
a
september
day
bright
and
beautiful
as
the
month
draws
toward
its
closing
and
ester
is
sitting
alone
in
her
room
in
the
low
easy
chair
by
the
open
window
and
in
her
lap
lies
an
open
letter
while
she
with
thoughtful
earnest
eyes
seems
reading
not
it
but
the
future
or
else
her
own
heart
the
letter
is
from
sadie
and
she
has
written
thus
my
dear
city
sister
mother
said
as
we
were
promenading
the
for
the
sake
of
exercise
and
also
to
clear
off
the
table
maggie
had
the
toothache
and
was
off
duty
my
dear
child
have
you
written
to
ester
yet
do
you
think
it
is
quite
right
to
neglect
her
so
when
she
must
be
very
anxious
to
hear
from
home
now
you
know
when
mother
says
my
dear
child
and
looks
at
me
from
out
those
reproachful
eyes
of
hers
there
is
nothing
short
of
mixing
a
mess
of
bread
that
i
would
not
do
for
her
so
here
i
am
place
third
story
front
time
position
foot
of
the
bed
julia
being
soundly
sleeping
at
the
head
one
gaiter
off
and
one
gaiter
on
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
son
john
so
renowned
in
history
speaking
of
bread
how
abominably
that
article
can
act
i
had
a
solemn
conflict
with
a
batch
of
it
this
morning
firstly
you
must
know
i
forgot
it
mother
assured
me
it
was
ready
to
be
mixed
before
i
awakened
so
it
must
have
been
before
that
event
took
place
that
the
forgetfulness
occurred
however
be
that
as
it
may
after
i
was
thoroughly
awake
and
up
and
i
still
forgot
it
the
fried
potatoes
were
frying
themselves
fast
to
that
abominable
black
dish
in
which
they
are
put
to
sizzle
and
which
by
the
way
is
the
most
nefarious
article
in
the
entire
kitchen
list
to
get
clean
save
and
excepting
the
well
as
i
was
saying
they
burned
themselves
and
i
ran
to
the
rescue
then
minie
wanted
me
to
go
to
the
yard
with
her
to
see
a
cunning
little
brown
and
gray
thing
with
some
greenish
spots
that
walked
and
spoke
to
her
the
interesting
stranger
proved
to
be
a
frog
while
examining
into
and
explaining
minutely
the
nature
and
character
and
occupations
of
the
entire
frog
family
the
mixture
in
the
tin
pail
behind
the
kitchen
stove
took
that
opportunity
to
my
what
a
bubble
it
was
in
and
what
an
interesting
odor
it
emitted
when
at
last
i
returned
from
frogdom
to
the
ordinary
walks
of
life
and
gave
it
my
attention
maggie
was
above
her
elbows
in
the
so
i
seized
the
pail
and
in
dire
haste
and
dismay
ran
up
two
flights
of
stairs
in
search
of
mother
i
suppose
you
know
what
followed
i
assure
you
i
think
mothers
and
soda
are
splendid
what
a
remarkable
institution
that
ingredient
is
while
i
made
sour
into
sweet
with
the
aid
of
its
soothing
proclivities
i
moralized
the
result
of
which
was
that
after
i
had
squeezed
and
mushed
and
rolled
over
and
thumped
and
patted
my
dough
the
requisite
number
of
times
i
tucked
it
away
under
blankets
in
a
corner
and
went
out
to
the
piazza
to
ask
douglass
if
he
knew
of
an
article
in
the
entire
round
of
materia
medica
which
could
be
given
to
human
beings
when
they
were
sour
and
disagreeable
and
which
after
the
manner
of
soda
in
dough
would
immediately
work
a
reform
on
his
acknowledging
his
utter
ignorance
of
any
such
principle
i
advanced
the
idea
that
cooking
was
a
much
more
developed
science
than
medicine
thence
followed
an
animated
discussion
but
in
the
meantime
what
do
you
suppose
that
bread
was
doing
just
spreading
itself
in
the
most
remarkable
manner
over
the
nice
blanket
under
which
i
had
cuddled
it
then
i
had
an
amazing
time
mother
said
the
patting
process
must
all
be
done
over
again
and
there
was
abundant
opportunity
for
more
moralizing
that
bread
developed
the
most
remarkable
that
i
ever
beheld
i
assure
you
if
total
depravity
is
a
mark
of
humanity
then
i
believe
my
dough
is
human
well
we
are
all
still
alive
though
poor
holland
is
i
fear
very
little
more
than
that
he
was
thrown
from
his
carriage
one
evening
last
week
and
brought
home
insensible
he
is
now
in
a
raging
fever
and
very
ill
indeed
for
once
in
their
lives
both
doctors
agree
he
is
delirious
most
of
the
time
and
his
delirium
takes
the
very
trying
form
which
leads
him
to
imagine
that
only
mother
can
do
any
thing
for
him
the
doctors
think
he
fancies
she
is
his
own
mother
and
that
he
is
a
boy
again
all
this
makes
matters
rather
hard
on
mother
she
is
frequently
with
him
half
the
night
and
often
maggie
and
i
are
left
to
reign
supreme
in
the
kitchen
for
the
entire
day
those
are
the
days
that
men
souls
especially
women
i
am
sometimes
tempted
to
think
that
all
the
book
knowledge
the
world
contains
is
not
to
be
compared
to
knowing
just
what
and
how
and
when
to
do
in
the
kitchen
i
quite
think
so
for
a
few
hours
when
mother
after
a
night
of
watching
in
a
sick
room
comes
down
to
undo
some
of
my
blundering
she
is
the
patientest
dearest
lovingest
kindest
mother
that
ever
a
mortal
had
and
just
because
she
is
so
patient
shall
i
rejoice
over
the
day
when
she
can
give
a
little
sigh
of
relief
and
leave
the
kitchen
calm
in
the
assurance
that
it
will
be
up
when
she
returns
ester
how
you
make
things
go
right
i
sure
i
try
harder
than
i
ever
knew
you
to
and
yet
salt
will
get
into
cakes
and
puddings
and
sugar
into
potatoes
just
here
i
conscience
smitten
i
beg
you
will
not
construe
one
of
the
above
sentences
as
having
the
remotest
allusion
to
your
being
sadly
missed
at
home
mother
said
i
was
not
even
to
such
a
thing
and
sure
i
have
i
a
housekeeper
the
fall
term
at
the
academy
opened
week
before
last
i
have
hidden
my
behind
that
old
barrel
in
the
corner
of
the
attic
i
thought
they
would
be
safer
there
than
below
stairs
at
least
i
was
sure
the
bread
would
do
better
in
the
oven
because
of
their
ascent
to
return
to
the
scene
of
our
present
trials
holland
is
i
suppose
very
dangerously
sick
and
poor
holland
is
the
very
embodiment
of
despair
when
i
look
at
her
in
prospective
misery
i
am
reminded
of
poor
dear
cousin
abbie
to
whom
i
would
write
if
it
did
seem
a
sacrilege
and
i
conclude
there
is
really
more
misery
in
this
world
of
ours
than
i
had
any
idea
of
i
discovered
why
the
world
was
made
round
it
must
be
to
typify
our
lives
sort
of
a
existence
you
know
coming
constantly
around
to
the
things
which
you
thought
you
had
done
yesterday
and
put
away
living
over
again
the
sorrows
which
you
thought
were
vanquished
last
week
i
sleepy
and
it
is
nearly
time
to
bake
cakes
for
breakfast
tip
of
the
morning
to
you
as
patrick
greets
maggie
yours
nonsensically
sadie
chapter
xx
at
home
over
this
letter
ester
had
laughed
and
cried
and
finally
settled
as
we
found
her
into
quiet
thought
when
abbie
came
in
after
a
little
and
nestled
on
an
ottoman
in
front
of
her
with
an
inquiring
look
ester
placed
the
letter
in
her
hands
without
note
or
comment
and
abbie
read
and
laughed
considerably
then
grew
more
sober
and
at
last
folded
the
letter
with
a
very
thoughtful
face
well
said
ester
at
last
smiling
a
little
and
abbie
answered
oh
ester
yes
said
ester
you
see
they
need
me
then
followed
a
somewhat
eager
somewhat
sorrowful
talk
and
then
a
moment
of
silence
fell
between
them
which
abbie
broke
by
a
sudden
question
ester
is
this
douglass
gaining
some
influence
over
sadie
have
i
imagined
it
or
does
she
speak
of
him
frequently
in
her
letters
in
a
way
that
gives
me
an
idea
that
his
influence
is
not
for
good
i
afraid
it
is
very
true
his
influence
over
her
seems
to
be
great
and
it
certainly
is
not
for
good
the
man
is
an
infidel
i
think
at
least
he
is
very
far
indeed
from
being
a
christian
do
you
know
i
read
a
verse
in
my
bible
this
morning
which
when
i
think
of
my
past
influence
over
sadie
reminds
me
bitterly
of
myself
it
was
like
this
men
slept
his
enemy
came
and
sowed
tares
if
i
had
not
been
asleep
i
might
have
won
sadie
for
the
savior
before
this
enemy
came
well
abbie
answered
gently
not
in
the
least
contradicting
this
sad
statement
but
yet
speaking
hopefully
you
will
try
to
undo
all
this
now
oh
abbie
i
do
know
i
am
so
weak
like
a
child
just
beginning
to
take
little
steps
alone
instead
of
being
the
strong
disciple
that
i
might
have
been
i
distrust
myself
i
am
afraid
i
not
afraid
for
you
abbie
said
speaking
very
earnestly
because
in
the
first
place
you
are
unlike
the
little
child
in
that
you
must
never
even
try
to
take
one
step
and
besides
there
are
more
verses
in
the
bible
than
that
one
see
here
let
me
show
you
mine
and
abbie
produced
her
little
pocket
bible
and
pointed
with
her
finger
while
ester
read
when
i
am
weak
then
am
i
strong
then
turning
the
leaves
rapidly
as
one
familiar
with
the
strongholds
of
that
tower
of
safety
she
pointed
again
and
ester
read
what
time
i
am
afraid
i
will
trust
in
thee
almost
five
of
a
sultry
october
day
one
of
those
days
which
come
to
us
sometimes
during
that
golden
month
like
a
regretful
turning
back
of
the
departing
summer
a
day
which
coming
to
people
who
have
much
hard
pressing
work
and
who
are
wearied
and
almost
stifled
with
the
summer
heat
makes
them
thoroughly
uncomfortable
not
to
say
cross
almost
five
and
in
the
great
of
the
rieds
sadie
was
rushing
nervously
back
and
forth
very
much
in
the
same
manner
that
ester
was
doing
on
that
first
evening
of
our
acquaintance
only
there
was
not
so
much
method
in
her
rushing
the
curtains
were
raised
as
high
as
the
tapes
would
take
them
and
the
slant
rays
of
the
yellow
sun
were
streaming
boldly
in
doing
their
bravest
to
melt
into
oil
the
balls
of
butter
on
the
table
for
poor
tired
bewildered
sadie
had
forgotten
to
let
down
the
shades
and
forgotten
the
ice
for
the
butter
and
had
laid
the
table
cloth
crookedly
and
had
no
time
to
straighten
it
this
had
been
one
of
her
trying
days
the
last
fierce
look
of
summer
had
parched
anew
the
fevered
limbs
of
the
sufferer
up
stairs
and
roused
to
sharper
conflict
the
bewildered
brain
ried
care
had
been
earnest
and
unremitting
and
sadie
in
her
unaccustomed
position
of
mistress
below
stairs
had
reached
the
very
verge
of
bewildered
weariness
she
gave
nervous
glances
at
the
inexorable
clock
as
she
flew
back
and
forth
there
were
those
among
ried
boarders
whose
business
made
it
almost
a
necessity
that
they
should
be
promptly
served
at
five
maggie
had
been
hurriedly
summoned
to
do
an
imperative
errand
connected
with
the
sick
room
and
this
inexperienced
butterfly
with
her
wings
sadly
drooping
was
trying
to
gather
her
scattered
wits
together
sufficiently
to
get
that
dreadful
ready
for
the
thirteen
boarders
who
were
already
waiting
the
summons
what
i
come
after
she
asked
herself
impatiently
as
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
frowning
forehead
and
stared
about
the
pantry
in
a
vain
attempt
to
decide
what
had
brought
her
there
in
such
hot
haste
oh
a
spoon
no
a
fork
i
guess
it
was
why
i
do
remember
the
forks
at
all
as
sure
as
i
here
i
believe
they
are
too
instead
of
being
on
the
table
and
oh
my
patience
i
believe
those
biscuits
are
burning
i
wonder
if
they
are
done
oh
dear
me
and
the
young
lady
who
was
hammond
star
scholar
bent
with
puzzled
burning
face
and
received
hot
whiffs
of
breath
from
the
indignant
oven
while
she
tried
to
discover
whether
the
biscuits
were
ready
to
be
devoured
it
was
an
engrossing
employment
she
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
near
the
door
nor
the
banging
of
trunks
on
the
side
piazza
she
was
half
way
across
the
with
her
tin
of
puffy
biscuits
in
her
hands
with
the
puzzled
doubtful
look
still
on
her
face
before
she
felt
the
touch
of
two
soft
loving
arms
around
her
neck
and
turning
quickly
she
screamed
rather
than
said
oh
ester
and
suddenly
seating
her
tin
of
biscuit
on
one
chair
and
herself
on
another
sadie
covered
her
face
with
both
hands
and
actually
cried
why
sadie
you
poor
dear
child
what
be
the
matter
and
ester
voice
was
full
of
anxiety
for
it
was
almost
the
first
time
that
she
had
ever
seen
tears
on
that
bright
young
face
sadie
first
remark
caused
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
springing
suddenly
to
her
feet
she
bent
anxious
eyes
on
the
chair
full
of
biscuit
oh
ester
she
said
these
biscuits
done
or
will
they
be
sticky
and
hateful
in
the
middle
ester
laughed
then
she
came
to
the
rescue
of
course
they
are
and
beautifully
too
did
you
make
them
here
i
take
them
out
sadie
where
is
mother
in
holland
room
she
has
been
there
nearly
all
day
holland
is
no
better
and
maggie
has
gone
on
an
errand
for
them
why
have
you
come
did
the
fairies
send
you
and
where
are
the
children
they
have
gone
to
walk
minie
wanted
mother
every
other
minute
so
alfred
and
julia
have
carried
her
off
with
them
say
you
ester
how
you
happen
to
come
how
shall
i
be
glad
enough
to
see
you
ester
laughed
then
i
ca
see
any
of
them
she
said
by
way
of
answer
never
mind
then
we
have
some
tea
you
poor
child
how
very
tired
you
look
just
seat
yourself
in
that
chair
and
see
if
i
have
forgotten
how
to
work
and
sadie
who
was
thoroughly
tired
and
more
nervous
than
she
had
any
idea
she
could
be
leaned
luxuriously
back
in
her
mother
chair
with
a
delicious
sense
of
unresponsibility
about
her
and
watched
a
magic
spell
come
over
the
room
down
came
the
shades
in
a
twinkling
and
the
low
red
sun
looked
in
on
them
no
more
the
straightened
itself
pickles
and
cheese
and
cake
got
out
of
their
confused
proximity
and
marched
each
to
their
appropriate
niche
on
the
table
a
flying
visit
into
regions
returned
hard
sparkling
butter
and
when
at
last
the
fragrant
tea
stood
ready
to
be
served
and
ester
bright
and
smiling
stationed
herself
behind
her
mother
chair
sadie
gave
a
little
relieved
sigh
and
then
she
laughed
you
straight
from
fairy
land
ester
i
know
it
now
that
has
been
crooked
in
spite
of
me
for
a
week
maggie
lays
it
and
i
straighten
it
i
do
get
to
it
i
travel
five
hundred
miles
every
night
to
get
this
supper
ready
and
it
never
ready
i
have
to
bob
up
for
a
fork
or
a
spoon
or
i
put
on
four
plates
of
butter
and
none
of
bread
oh
there
is
witch
work
about
it
and
none
but
thoroughbred
witches
can
get
every
thing
every
little
insignificant
indispensable
thing
on
a
table
i
ca
keep
house
you
poor
kitten
said
ester
filled
with
very
tender
sympathy
for
this
pretty
young
sister
and
feeling
very
glad
indeed
that
she
had
come
home
who
would
think
of
expecting
a
butterfly
to
spin
you
shall
bring
those
dear
books
down
from
the
attic
in
the
meantime
where
is
the
oh
we
do
ring
said
sadie
rising
as
she
spoke
the
noise
disturbs
holland
here
comes
my
first
lieutenant
who
takes
charge
of
that
matter
my
sister
miss
ried
dr
douglass
and
ester
as
she
returned
the
low
deferential
bow
bestowed
upon
her
felt
anew
the
thrill
of
anxiety
which
had
come
to
her
of
late
when
she
thought
of
this
dangerous
stranger
in
connection
with
her
beautiful
giddy
unchristian
sister
on
the
whole
ester
home
coming
was
pleasant
to
be
sure
it
was
a
wonderful
change
from
her
late
life
and
there
was
perhaps
just
the
faintest
bit
of
a
sigh
as
she
drew
off
her
dainty
cuffs
and
prepared
to
wipe
the
dishes
which
sadie
washed
while
maggie
finished
her
interrupted
ironing
what
would
john
the
stylish
waiter
at
uncle
ralph
think
if
he
could
see
her
now
and
how
funny
abbie
would
look
engaged
in
such
employment
but
sadie
looked
so
bright
and
relieved
and
rested
and
chatted
so
gayly
that
presently
ester
gave
another
little
sigh
and
said
poor
abbie
how
very
lonely
she
must
be
i
wish
she
were
here
for
you
to
cheer
her
sadie
later
while
she
dipped
into
the
flour
preparatory
to
relieving
sadie
of
her
fearful
task
of
sponge
setting
the
kitchen
clock
struck
seven
this
time
she
laughed
at
the
contrast
they
were
just
going
down
to
dinner
now
at
uncle
ralph
only
night
before
last
she
was
there
herself
she
had
been
out
that
day
with
aunt
helen
and
so
was
attired
in
the
lovely
blue
silk
and
the
real
laces
which
were
aunt
gift
fastened
at
the
throat
by
a
tiny
pearl
abbie
last
offering
now
they
were
sitting
down
to
dinner
without
her
and
she
was
in
the
great
pantry
five
hundred
miles
away
a
long
wide
calico
apron
quite
covering
up
her
traveling
dress
sleeves
rolled
above
her
elbows
and
engaged
in
scooping
flour
out
of
the
barrel
into
her
great
wooden
bowl
but
then
how
her
mother
weary
careworn
face
had
brightened
and
glowed
into
pleased
surprise
as
she
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
her
how
lovingly
she
had
folded
her
in
those
dear
arms
and
said
actually
with
lips
all
a
tremble
my
daughter
what
an
unexpected
blessing
and
what
a
kind
providence
that
you
have
come
just
now
then
alfred
and
julia
had
been
as
eager
and
jubilant
in
their
greeting
as
though
ester
had
been
always
to
them
the
very
perfection
of
a
sister
and
had
little
minie
crumpled
her
dainty
collar
into
an
unsightly
rag
and
given
her
scotch
kisses
and
dutch
kisses
and
yankee
kisses
and
genuine
sweet
baby
kisses
in
her
uncontrollable
glee
over
dear
auntie
essie
and
besides
oh
besides
this
ester
ried
who
had
come
home
was
not
the
ester
ried
who
had
gone
out
from
them
only
two
months
ago
a
whole
lifetime
of
experience
and
discipline
seemed
to
her
to
have
been
crowded
into
those
two
months
nothing
of
her
past
awakened
more
keen
regret
in
this
young
girl
heart
than
the
thought
of
her
undutiful
unsisterly
life
it
was
all
to
be
different
now
she
thanked
god
that
he
had
let
her
come
back
to
that
very
kitchen
and
to
undo
her
former
work
the
old
sluggish
selfish
spirit
had
gone
from
her
before
this
every
thing
had
been
done
for
ester
ried
now
it
was
to
be
done
for
christ
even
the
mixing
up
of
that
flour
and
water
for
was
not
the
word
given
ye
do
do
all
to
the
glory
of
god
how
broad
that
word
was
whatsoever
why
that
covered
every
movement
yes
and
every
word
how
life
have
seemed
to
her
dull
and
uninteresting
and
profitless
sadie
hushed
her
busy
tongue
that
evening
as
she
saw
in
the
moonlight
ester
kneeling
to
pray
and
a
kind
of
awe
stole
over
her
for
a
moment
as
she
saw
that
the
kneeler
seemed
unconscious
of
any
earthly
presence
somehow
it
struck
sadie
as
a
different
matter
from
any
kneeling
which
she
had
ever
watched
in
the
moonlight
before
and
ester
as
she
rested
her
tired
happy
head
upon
her
own
pillow
felt
this
word
ringing
sweetly
in
her
heart
and
ye
are
christ
and
christ
is
god
chapter
xxi
tested
ester
was
winding
the
last
smooth
coil
of
hair
around
her
head
when
sadie
opened
her
eyes
the
next
morning
my
she
said
do
you
know
ester
it
is
perfectly
delightful
to
me
to
lie
here
and
look
at
you
and
remember
that
i
shall
not
be
responsible
for
those
cakes
this
morning
they
shall
want
a
pint
of
soda
added
to
them
for
all
that
i
shall
need
to
know
or
care
ester
laughed
you
will
surely
have
pantry
well
stocked
with
soda
she
said
gayly
it
seems
to
have
made
a
very
strong
impression
on
your
mind
but
the
greeting
had
chimed
with
her
previous
thoughts
and
sounded
pleasant
to
her
she
had
come
home
to
be
the
helper
her
mother
and
sadie
should
feel
and
realize
after
this
how
very
much
of
a
helper
she
could
be
that
very
day
should
be
the
commencement
of
her
old
new
life
it
was
baking
day
her
detestation
heretofore
her
pleasure
now
no
more
useful
day
could
be
chosen
how
she
would
dispatch
the
pies
and
cakes
and
biscuits
to
say
nothing
of
the
wonderful
loaves
of
bread
she
smiled
brightly
on
her
young
sister
as
she
realized
in
a
measure
the
weight
of
care
which
she
was
about
to
lift
from
her
shoulders
and
by
the
time
she
was
ready
for
the
duties
of
the
day
she
had
lived
over
in
imagination
the
entire
routine
of
duties
connected
with
that
busy
useful
happy
day
she
went
out
from
her
little
wrapped
in
armor
the
pantry
and
kitchen
were
to
be
her
and
a
whole
host
of
old
temptations
and
trials
were
there
to
be
met
and
vanquished
so
ester
planned
and
yet
it
so
happened
that
she
did
not
once
enter
the
kitchen
during
all
that
long
busy
day
and
sadie
young
shoulders
bore
more
of
the
hundred
little
burdens
of
life
that
saturday
than
they
had
ever
felt
before
descending
the
stairs
ester
met
van
anden
for
the
first
time
since
her
return
he
greeted
her
with
a
hurried
quite
as
if
he
had
seen
her
only
the
day
before
and
at
once
pressed
her
into
service
miss
ester
will
you
go
to
holland
immediately
i
can
not
find
your
mother
send
holland
from
the
room
she
excites
him
tell
her
say
she
must
come
immediately
to
the
i
wish
to
see
her
give
holland
a
half
teaspoonful
of
the
mixture
in
the
every
ten
minutes
and
on
no
account
leave
him
until
i
return
which
will
be
as
soon
as
possible
and
seeming
to
be
certain
that
his
directions
would
be
followed
the
doctor
vanished
for
only
about
a
quarter
of
a
minute
did
ester
stand
irresolute
van
anden
tone
and
manner
were
full
of
his
usual
authority
a
habit
with
him
which
had
always
annoyed
her
she
shrank
with
a
feeling
amounting
almost
to
terror
from
a
dark
quiet
room
and
the
position
of
nurse
her
base
of
operations
according
to
her
own
arrangements
had
been
the
light
airy
kitchen
where
she
felt
herself
needed
at
this
very
moment
but
one
can
think
of
several
things
in
a
quarter
of
a
minute
ester
had
very
lately
taken
up
the
habit
of
securing
one
bible
verse
as
part
of
her
armor
to
go
with
her
through
the
day
on
this
particular
morning
the
verse
was
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
thy
might
now
if
her
hands
had
found
work
waiting
for
her
down
this
first
flight
of
stairs
instead
of
down
two
as
she
had
planned
what
was
that
to
her
ester
turned
and
went
swiftly
to
the
sick
room
dispatched
the
almost
frantic
wife
according
to
the
doctor
peremptory
orders
gave
the
mixture
as
directed
waited
patiently
for
the
doctor
return
only
to
hear
herself
installed
as
head
nurse
for
the
day
given
just
time
enough
to
take
a
very
hurried
second
table
meal
with
sadie
listen
to
her
half
pitiful
half
comic
complainings
and
learn
that
her
mother
was
down
with
sick
headache
so
it
was
that
this
first
day
at
home
drew
toward
its
closing
and
not
one
single
thing
that
ester
had
planned
to
do
and
do
so
well
had
she
been
able
to
accomplish
it
had
been
very
hard
to
sit
patiently
there
and
watch
the
low
breathings
of
that
almost
motionless
man
on
the
bed
before
her
to
rouse
him
at
set
intervals
sufficiently
to
pour
some
mixture
down
his
unwilling
lips
to
fan
him
occasionally
and
that
was
all
it
had
been
hard
but
ester
had
not
chafed
under
it
she
had
recognized
the
necessity
no
nurse
to
be
found
her
mother
sick
and
the
young
frightened
as
well
as
wife
not
to
be
trusted
clearly
she
was
at
the
post
of
duty
so
as
the
red
sun
peeped
in
a
from
a
little
corner
of
the
closed
curtain
it
found
ester
not
angry
but
sad
a
weary
day
and
this
man
on
the
bed
was
dying
both
doctors
had
that
at
each
other
at
least
a
dozen
times
that
day
how
her
life
of
late
was
being
mixed
up
with
death
she
had
just
passed
through
one
sharp
lesson
and
here
at
the
threshold
awaited
another
different
from
that
last
though
oh
different
and
herein
lay
some
of
the
sadness
foster
had
said
every
thing
was
ready
for
the
long
journey
even
should
there
be
no
return
then
she
went
back
for
a
minute
to
the
look
of
glory
on
that
marble
face
and
heard
again
that
wonderful
sentence
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
but
this
man
here
every
thing
had
not
been
made
ready
by
him
so
at
least
she
feared
yet
she
was
conscious
professed
christian
though
she
had
been
living
in
the
same
house
with
him
for
so
many
years
that
she
knew
very
little
about
him
she
had
seen
much
of
him
had
talked
much
with
him
but
she
had
never
mentioned
to
him
the
name
of
christ
the
name
after
which
she
called
herself
the
sun
sank
lower
it
was
almost
gone
this
weary
day
was
nearly
done
and
very
sad
and
felt
this
young
watcher
the
day
begun
in
brightness
was
closing
in
gloom
it
was
not
all
so
clear
a
path
as
she
had
thought
there
were
some
things
that
she
could
not
undo
those
days
of
opportunity
in
which
she
might
at
least
have
invited
this
man
to
jesus
were
gone
it
seemed
altogether
probable
that
there
would
never
come
another
there
was
a
little
rustle
of
the
drapery
about
the
bed
and
she
turned
suddenly
to
meet
the
great
searching
eyes
of
the
sick
man
bent
full
upon
her
then
he
spoke
in
low
but
wonderfully
distinct
and
solemn
tones
and
the
words
he
slowly
uttered
were
yet
more
startling
am
i
going
to
die
oh
what
ester
to
say
how
those
great
bright
eyes
searched
her
soul
looking
into
them
feeling
the
awful
solemnity
of
the
question
she
could
not
answer
no
and
it
seemed
almost
equally
impossible
to
tell
him
yes
so
the
silence
was
unbroken
while
she
trembled
in
every
nerve
and
felt
her
face
blanch
before
the
continued
gaze
of
those
mournful
eyes
at
length
the
silence
seemed
to
answer
him
for
he
turned
his
head
suddenly
from
her
and
half
buried
it
in
the
pillow
and
neither
spoke
nor
moved
that
awful
silence
that
moment
of
opportunity
perhaps
the
last
of
earth
for
him
perhaps
it
was
given
to
her
to
speak
to
him
the
last
words
that
he
would
ever
hear
from
mortal
lips
what
she
say
if
she
only
knew
how
only
had
words
yet
must
be
said
then
there
came
to
ester
one
of
those
marked
bible
verses
which
had
of
late
grown
so
precious
and
her
voice
low
and
clear
filled
the
blank
in
the
room
god
is
our
refuge
and
strength
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
no
sound
from
the
quiet
figure
on
the
bed
she
could
not
even
tell
if
he
had
heard
yet
perhaps
he
might
and
so
she
gathered
them
a
little
string
of
wondrous
pearls
and
let
them
fall
with
soft
and
gentle
cadence
from
her
lips
commit
thy
way
unto
the
lord
trust
also
in
him
and
he
shall
bring
it
to
pass
the
lord
is
nigh
unto
all
them
that
call
upon
him
the
lord
is
gracious
and
full
of
compassion
thus
saith
the
lord
your
redeemer
the
holy
one
of
israel
i
even
i
am
he
that
blotteth
out
thy
transgressions
for
mine
own
sake
and
will
not
remember
thy
sins
look
unto
me
and
be
ye
saved
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
for
i
am
god
and
there
is
none
else
incline
your
ear
and
come
unto
me
hear
and
your
soul
shall
live
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
ester
repeated
in
tones
that
were
full
of
sweetness
that
one
little
verse
which
had
become
the
embodiment
to
her
of
all
that
was
tender
and
soothing
and
wonderful
what
time
i
am
afraid
i
will
trust
in
thee
was
this
man
moving
toward
the
very
verge
of
the
river
afraid
ester
did
not
know
was
not
to
know
whether
those
gracious
invitations
from
the
redeemer
of
the
world
had
fallen
once
more
on
unheeding
ears
or
not
for
with
a
little
sigh
born
partly
of
relief
and
partly
of
sorrow
that
the
opportunity
was
gone
she
turned
to
meet
van
anden
and
was
sent
for
a
few
moments
out
into
the
light
and
glory
of
the
departing
day
to
catch
a
bit
of
its
freshness
it
was
as
the
last
midnight
stroke
of
that
long
long
day
was
being
given
that
they
were
gathered
about
the
dying
bed
sadie
was
there
solemn
and
ried
had
arisen
from
her
couch
of
suffering
and
nerved
herself
to
be
a
support
to
the
poor
young
wife
douglass
at
the
side
of
the
sick
man
kept
anxious
watch
over
the
fluttering
pulse
ester
on
the
other
side
looked
on
in
helpless
pity
and
other
friends
of
the
hollands
were
grouped
about
the
room
so
they
watched
and
waited
for
the
swift
of
the
angel
of
death
the
death
damp
had
gathered
on
his
brow
the
pulse
seemed
but
a
faint
tremble
now
and
then
and
those
whose
eyes
were
used
to
death
thought
that
his
lips
would
never
frame
mortal
sound
again
when
suddenly
the
eyelids
raised
and
holland
fixing
a
steady
gaze
upon
the
eyes
bent
on
him
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
whither
ester
had
slipped
to
make
more
room
for
her
mother
and
holland
said
in
a
clear
distinct
tone
one
unmistakable
word
pray
will
ester
ever
forget
the
start
of
terror
which
thrilled
her
frame
as
she
felt
that
look
and
heard
that
word
she
cast
a
quick
frightened
glance
around
her
of
inquiry
and
appeal
but
her
mother
and
herself
were
the
only
ones
present
whom
she
had
reason
to
think
ever
prayed
could
she
she
that
gentle
timid
shrinking
mother
but
ried
was
supporting
the
now
almost
fainting
form
of
holland
and
giving
anxious
attention
to
her
he
says
pray
sadie
murmured
in
low
frightened
tones
oh
where
is
van
anden
ester
knew
he
had
been
called
in
great
haste
to
the
house
across
the
way
and
ere
he
could
return
this
waiting
spirit
might
be
gone
gone
without
a
word
of
prayer
would
ester
want
to
die
so
with
no
voice
to
cry
for
her
to
that
listening
savior
but
then
no
human
being
had
ever
heard
her
pray
could
she
must
she
oh
for
van
anden
a
christian
doctor
oh
if
that
infidel
stood
anywhere
but
there
with
his
steady
hand
clasping
the
fluttering
pulse
with
his
cool
calm
eyes
bent
curiously
on
her
but
holland
was
dying
perhaps
the
everlasting
arms
were
not
underneath
him
and
at
this
fearful
thought
ester
dropped
upon
her
knees
giving
utterance
to
her
deepest
need
in
the
first
uttered
words
oh
holy
spirit
teach
me
just
what
to
say
her
mother
listening
with
startled
senses
as
the
familiar
voice
fell
on
her
ear
could
but
think
that
petition
was
answered
and
ester
felt
it
in
her
very
soul
douglass
her
mother
sadie
all
of
them
were
as
nothing
there
was
only
this
dying
man
and
christ
and
she
pleading
that
the
passing
soul
might
be
met
even
now
by
the
angel
of
the
covenant
there
were
those
in
the
room
who
never
forgot
that
prayer
of
ester
van
anden
entering
hastily
paused
midway
in
the
room
taking
in
the
scene
in
an
instant
of
time
and
then
was
on
his
knees
uniting
his
silent
petitions
with
hers
so
fervent
and
persistent
was
the
cry
for
help
that
even
the
sobs
of
the
stricken
wife
were
hushed
in
awe
and
only
the
watching
doctor
with
his
finger
on
the
pulse
knew
when
the
last
fluttering
beat
died
out
and
the
pressed
his
triumphant
seal
on
pallid
lip
and
brow
van
anden
ester
said
as
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
the
next
morning
waiting
in
the
chamber
of
death
for
directions
was
did
he
with
an
inclination
of
her
head
toward
the
silent
occupant
of
the
couch
did
he
ever
think
he
was
a
christian
the
doctor
bent
on
her
a
grave
sad
look
and
slowly
shook
his
head
oh
doctor
you
can
not
think
that
he
and
ester
stopped
her
face
blanching
with
the
fearfulness
of
her
thought
shall
not
the
judge
of
all
the
earth
do
right
this
was
the
doctor
solemn
answer
after
a
moment
he
added
perhaps
that
one
word
said
as
much
to
the
ears
of
him
whose
thoughts
are
not
as
our
thoughts
as
did
that
petition
me
when
thou
comest
into
thy
kingdom
ester
never
forgot
that
and
the
following
day
while
the
corpse
of
one
whom
she
had
known
so
well
lay
in
the
house
and
when
she
followed
him
to
the
quiet
grave
and
watched
the
red
and
yellow
autumn
leaves
flutter
down
around
his
coffin
dead
leaves
dead
flowers
dead
hopes
death
not
just
a
going
up
higher
as
foster
death
had
been
this
was
solemn
and
inexorable
death
more
than
ever
she
felt
how
impossible
it
was
to
call
back
the
days
that
had
slipped
away
while
she
slept
and
do
their
neglected
duties
she
had
come
for
this
full
of
hope
and
now
one
of
those
whom
she
had
met
many
times
each
day
for
years
and
never
said
jesus
to
was
at
this
moment
being
lowered
into
his
narrow
house
and
though
god
had
graciously
given
her
an
inch
of
time
and
strength
to
use
it
it
was
as
nothing
compared
with
those
wasted
years
and
she
could
never
know
at
least
never
until
the
call
came
for
her
whether
or
not
at
the
eleventh
hour
this
poor
man
cried
and
the
lord
heard
him
and
received
him
into
paradise
van
anden
moved
around
to
where
she
was
standing
with
tightly
clasped
hands
and
colorless
lips
he
had
been
watching
her
and
this
was
what
he
said
ester
shall
you
and
i
ever
stand
again
beside
a
grave
receiving
one
whom
we
have
known
ever
so
slightly
and
have
to
settle
with
our
consciences
and
our
savior
because
we
have
not
invited
that
one
to
come
to
jesus
and
ester
answered
with
lips
as
that
savior
hears
me
and
will
help
me
chapter

little
plum
pies
ester
was
in
the
kitchen
trimming
off
the
puffy
crusts
of
endless
pies
the
old
brown
calico
morning
dress
the
same
huge
bib
apron
which
had
been
through
endless
similar
scrapes
with
her
every
thing
about
her
looking
exactly
as
it
had
three
months
ago
and
yet
so
far
as
ester
and
her
future
yes
and
the
future
of
every
one
about
her
was
concerned
things
were
very
different
perhaps
sadie
had
a
glimmering
of
some
strange
change
as
she
eyed
her
sister
curiously
and
took
note
that
there
was
a
different
light
in
her
eye
and
a
sort
of
smoothness
on
the
quiet
face
that
she
had
never
noticed
before
in
fact
sadie
missed
some
wrinkles
which
she
had
supposed
were
part
and
parcel
of
ester
self
how
i
hate
that
part
of
it
she
remarked
watching
the
fingers
that
moved
deftly
around
each
completed
sphere
mother
said
my
edges
always
looked
as
if
a
mouse
had
marched
around
them
nibbling
all
the
way
my
how
thoroughly
i
hate
housekeeping
i
pity
the
one
who
takes
me
for
better
or
worse
always
provided
there
exists
such
a
poor
victim
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
do
think
you
hate
it
half
so
much
as
you
imagine
ester
answered
kindly
any
way
you
did
nicely
mother
says
you
were
a
great
comfort
to
her
there
was
a
sudden
mist
before
sadie
eyes
did
mother
say
that
she
queried
the
blessed
woman
what
a
very
little
it
takes
to
make
a
comfort
for
her
ester
i
declare
to
you
if
ever
angels
get
into
kitchens
and
pantries
and
the
like
mother
is
one
of
them
the
way
she
bore
with
my
endless
blunderings
was
perfectly
angelic
i
glad
though
that
her
day
of
martyrdom
is
over
and
mine
too
for
that
matter
and
sadie
who
had
returned
to
the
kingdom
of
spotless
dresses
and
snowy
cuffs
and
above
all
to
the
dear
books
and
the
academy
caught
at
that
moment
the
sound
of
the
academy
bell
and
flitted
away
ester
filled
the
oven
with
pies
then
went
to
the
side
doorway
to
get
a
peep
at
the
glowing
world
it
was
the
very
perfection
of
a
day
autumn
meant
to
die
in
wondrous
beauty
that
year
ester
folded
her
bare
arms
and
gazed
she
felt
little
thrills
of
a
new
kind
of
restlessness
all
about
her
this
morning
she
wanted
to
do
something
grand
something
splendidly
good
it
was
all
very
well
to
make
good
pies
she
had
done
that
given
them
the
benefit
of
her
highest
skill
in
that
line
now
they
were
being
perfected
in
the
oven
and
she
waited
for
something
if
ever
a
girl
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
show
her
colors
to
honor
her
leader
it
was
our
ester
oh
yes
she
meant
to
do
the
duty
that
lay
next
her
but
she
perfectly
ached
to
have
that
next
duty
something
grand
something
that
would
show
all
about
her
what
a
new
life
she
had
taken
on
van
anden
was
tramping
about
in
his
room
over
the
side
piazza
a
very
unusual
proceeding
with
him
at
that
hour
of
the
day
his
windows
were
open
and
he
was
singing
and
the
fresh
lake
wind
brought
tune
and
words
right
down
to
ester
ear
i
would
not
have
the
restless
will
that
hurries
to
and
fro
seeking
for
some
great
thing
to
do
or
wondrous
thing
to
know
i
would
be
guided
as
a
child
and
led
i
go
i
ask
thee
for
the
daily
strength
to
none
that
ask
denied
a
mind
to
blend
with
outward
life
while
keeping
at
thy
side
content
to
fill
a
little
space
if
thou
be
glorified
of
course
van
anden
did
not
know
that
ester
ried
stood
in
the
doorway
below
and
was
at
that
precise
moment
in
need
of
just
such
help
as
this
but
then
what
mattered
that
so
long
as
the
master
did
just
then
another
sense
belonging
to
ester
did
its
duty
and
gave
notice
that
the
pies
in
the
oven
were
burning
and
she
ran
to
their
rescue
humming
meantime
content
to
fill
a
little
space
if
thou
be
glorified
eleven
found
her
busily
paring
potatoes
hurrying
a
little
for
in
spite
of
swift
busy
fingers
their
work
was
getting
a
little
the
best
of
maggie
and
her
and
one
pair
of
very
helpful
hands
was
missing
alfred
and
julia
appeared
from
somewhere
in
the
outer
regions
and
ester
was
too
busy
to
see
that
they
both
carried
rather
faces
has
mother
got
back
yet
queried
alfred
why
no
said
ester
she
will
not
be
back
until
perhaps
not
then
did
you
know
carleton
was
worse
alfred
kicked
his
heels
against
the
kitchen
door
in
a
most
disconsolate
manner
somebody
always
sick
he
grumbled
out
at
last
a
fellow
might
as
well
not
have
a
mother
i
never
saw
the
beat
nobody
for
miles
around
here
can
have
the
toothache
without
borrowing
mother
i
just
sick
and
tired
of
it
ester
had
nearly
laughed
but
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
forlorn
face
she
thought
better
of
it
and
said
something
is
awry
now
i
know
you
never
want
mother
in
such
a
hopeless
way
as
that
unless
you
in
trouble
so
you
see
you
are
just
like
the
rest
of
them
every
body
wants
mother
when
they
are
in
any
difficulty
but
she
is
my
mother
and
i
have
a
right
to
her
and
the
rest
of
have
well
said
ester
soothingly
suppose
i
be
mother
this
time
tell
me
what
the
matter
and
i
act
as
much
like
her
as
possible
and
thereupon
alfred
gave
a
most
uncomplimentary
sniff
queer
work
you
make
of
it
try
me
was
the
reply
i
ai
going
to
i
know
well
enough
you
say
or
or
some
such
word
and
finish
up
with
get
out
of
my
way
now
although
ester
cheeks
were
pretty
red
over
this
exact
imitation
of
her
former
ungracious
self
she
still
answered
briskly
very
well
suppose
i
should
make
such
a
very
rude
and
unmotherlike
reply
fiddlesticks
and
nonsense
would
not
shoot
you
would
they
at
which
sentence
alfred
stopped
kicking
his
heels
against
the
door
and
laughed
tell
us
all
about
it
continued
ester
following
up
her
advantage
nothing
to
tell
much
only
all
the
folks
are
going
a
sail
on
the
lake
this
afternoon
and
going
to
have
a
picnic
in
the
grove
the
very
last
one
before
snow
and
i
meant
to
ask
mother
to
let
us
go
only
how
was
i
going
to
know
that
carleton
would
get
sick
and
come
away
down
here
after
her
before
daylight
and
i
know
she
would
have
let
me
go
too
and
they
going
to
take
things
a
basketful
each
one
of
and
they
wanted
me
to
bring
little
bits
of
pies
such
as
mother
bakes
in
little
round
tins
you
know
plum
pies
and
she
would
have
made
me
some
i
know
she
always
does
but
now
she
gone
and
all
up
and
i
shall
have
to
stay
at
home
like
i
always
do
just
for
sick
folks
it
mean
any
how
ester
smothered
a
laugh
over
this
curious
jumble
and
asked
a
humble
question
is
there
really
nothing
that
would
do
for
your
basket
but
little
bits
of
plum
pies
no
alfred
explained
earnestly
because
you
see
they
got
plenty
of
cake
and
such
stuff
the
girls
bring
that
and
they
do
like
my
pies
awfully
i
most
always
take
hammond
likes
them
too
he
going
along
to
take
care
of
us
and
i
should
like
to
go
without
the
little
pies
because
they
depend
upon
them
oh
said
ester
girls
go
too
do
they
and
she
looked
for
the
first
time
at
the
long
sad
face
of
julia
in
the
corner
yes
and
jule
is
in
just
as
much
trouble
as
i
am
cause
they
are
all
going
to
wear
white
dresses
and
she
tore
hers
and
she
says
she
ca
wear
it
till
it
ironed
cause
it
looks
like
a
rope
and
maggie
says
she
ca
and
wo
iron
it
and
mother
was
going
to
mend
it
this
very
morning
and
oh
fudge
it
no
use
talking
we
got
to
stay
at
home
jule
so
now
and
the
kicking
heels
commenced
again
ester
pared
her
last
potato
with
a
half
troubled
half
amused
face
she
was
thoroughly
tired
of
baking
for
that
day
and
felt
like
saying
fiddlesticks
to
the
little
plum
pies
and
that
white
dress
was
torn
and
every
way
and
ironing
was
always
hateful
besides
it
seem
strange
that
when
she
wanted
to
do
some
great
nice
thing
so
much
plum
pies
and
torn
dresses
should
step
right
into
her
path
then
unconsciously
she
repeated
content
to
fill
a
space
if
art
glorified
he
be
glorified
though
by
such
very
little
things
yet
had
she
wanted
to
gain
an
influence
over
alfred
and
julia
and
was
this
her
first
opportunity
besides
there
was
that
verse
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
at
that
point
her
thoughts
took
shape
in
words
well
sir
we
see
whether
mother
is
the
only
woman
in
this
world
after
all
you
tramp
down
cellar
and
bring
me
up
that
stone
jar
on
the
second
shelf
and
we
have
those
pies
in
the
oven
in
a
twinkling
and
that
little
woman
in
the
corner
with
two
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
may
bring
her
white
dress
and
my
and
thimble
and
put
two
irons
on
the
stove
and
my
word
for
it
you
shall
both
be
ready
by
three
spry
and
span
pies
and
all
by
three
on
the
afternoon
in
question
ester
was
thoroughly
tired
but
little
plum
pies
by
the
dozen
were
cuddling
among
snowy
napkins
in
the
willow
basket
and
alfred
face
was
radiant
as
he
expressed
his
satisfaction
after
this
fashion
you
just
jolly
ester
i
did
know
you
could
be
so
good
the
boys
chuckle
over
these
pies
though
ester
there
just
seven
more
than
mother
ever
made
me
very
well
answered
ester
gayly
then
there
will
be
just
seven
more
chuckles
this
time
than
usual
julia
expressed
her
thoughts
in
a
way
more
like
her
she
surveyed
her
and
beautifully
smooth
white
dress
with
smiling
eyes
and
as
ester
tied
the
blue
sash
in
a
dainty
knot
and
stepped
back
to
see
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
she
was
suddenly
confronted
with
this
question
ester
what
does
make
you
so
nice
you
did
ever
used
to
be
so
how
the
blood
rushed
into
ester
cheeks
as
she
struggled
with
her
desire
to
either
laugh
or
cry
she
hardly
knew
which
these
were
very
little
things
which
she
had
done
and
it
was
shameful
that
in
all
the
years
of
her
elder
sisterhood
she
had
never
sacrificed
even
so
little
of
her
own
pleasure
before
yet
it
was
true
and
it
made
her
feel
like
crying
and
yet
there
was
rather
a
ludicrous
side
to
the
question
to
think
that
all
her
beautiful
plans
for
the
day
had
culminated
in
plum
pies
and
ironing
she
stooped
and
kissed
julia
on
the
rosy
cheek
and
answered
gently
moved
by
some
inward
impulse
i
am
trying
to
do
all
my
work
for
jesus
nowadays
you
did
mend
my
dress
and
iron
it
and
curl
my
hair
and
fix
my
sash
for
him
did
you
yes
every
little
thing
why
i
do
see
how
i
thought
you
did
them
for
me
i
did
julia
to
please
you
and
make
you
happy
but
jesus
says
that
that
is
just
the
same
as
doing
it
for
him
julia
next
question
was
very
searching
but
ester
i
thought
you
had
been
a
member
of
the
church
a
good
many
years
sadie
said
so
did
you
ever
try
to
do
things
for
jesus
before
a
burning
blush
of
genuine
shame
mantled
ester
face
but
she
answered
quickly
no
i
do
think
i
ever
really
did
julia
eyed
her
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
grave
wonderment
then
suddenly
stood
on
tiptoe
to
return
the
kiss
as
she
said
well
i
think
it
is
nice
anyway
if
jesus
likes
to
have
you
be
so
kind
and
take
so
much
trouble
for
me
why
then
he
must
love
me
and
i
mean
to
thank
him
this
very
night
when
i
say
my
prayers
and
as
ester
rested
for
a
moment
in
the
on
the
piazza
and
watched
her
little
brother
and
sister
move
briskly
off
she
hummed
again
those
two
lines
that
had
been
making
unconscious
music
in
her
heart
all
day
content
to
fill
a
space
if
thou
be
glorified
chapter
xxiii
crosses
the
large
church
was
full
there
seemed
not
to
be
another
space
for
a
human
being
people
who
were
not
much
given
to
frequenting
the
house
of
god
on
a
evening
had
certainly
been
drawn
thither
at
this
time
sadie
ried
sat
beside
ester
in
their
mother
pew
and
harry
arnett
with
a
sober
look
on
his
boyish
face
sat
bolt
upright
in
the
end
of
the
pew
while
even
douglass
leaned
forward
with
graceful
nonchalance
from
the
seat
behind
them
and
now
and
then
addressed
a
word
to
sadie
these
people
had
been
listening
to
such
a
sermon
as
is
very
seldom
heard
that
blessed
man
of
god
whose
name
is
dear
to
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people
whose
hair
is
whitened
with
the
frosts
of
many
a
year
spent
in
the
master
service
whose
voice
and
brain
and
heart
are
yet
strong
and
powerful
and
mighty
through
god
the
rev
parker
had
been
speaking
to
them
and
his
theme
had
been
the
soul
and
his
text
had
been
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
i
hope
i
am
writing
for
many
who
have
had
the
honor
of
hearing
that
appeal
fresh
from
the
great
brain
and
greater
heart
of
parker
such
will
understand
the
spell
under
which
his
congregation
sat
even
after
the
prayer
and
hymn
had
died
into
silence
now
the
veteran
stood
bending
over
the
pulpit
waiting
for
the
christian
witnesses
to
the
truth
of
his
solemn
messages
and
for
that
he
seemed
likely
to
wait
a
few
earnest
men
veterans
too
in
the
cause
gave
in
their
testimony
and
then
occurred
one
of
those
miserable
disheartening
disgraceful
pauses
which
are
met
with
nowhere
on
earth
among
a
company
of
intelligent
men
and
women
with
liberty
given
them
to
talk
save
in
a
still
silence
and
still
the
aged
servant
stood
with
one
arm
resting
on
the
bible
and
looked
down
almost
beseechingly
upon
that
crowd
of
dumb
christians
ye
are
my
witnesses
saith
the
lord
he
repeated
in
earnest
pleading
tones
miserable
witnesses
they
was
not
the
lord
ashamed
of
them
all
i
wonder
something
like
this
flitted
through
ester
brain
as
she
looked
around
upon
that
faithless
company
and
noted
here
and
there
one
who
certainly
ought
to
take
up
his
cross
then
some
slight
idea
of
the
folly
of
that
expression
struck
her
what
a
fearful
cross
it
was
to
be
sure
what
a
strange
idea
to
use
the
same
word
in
describing
it
that
was
used
for
that
cross
on
calvary
then
a
thought
very
startling
in
its
significance
came
to
her
was
that
cross
borne
only
for
men
were
they
the
only
ones
who
had
a
because
of
calvary
surely
savior
hung
there
and
bled
and
groaned
and
died
for
her
why
should
not
she
say
by
his
stripes
am
healed
what
if
she
should
what
would
people
think
no
not
that
either
what
would
jesus
think
that
after
all
was
the
important
question
did
she
really
believe
that
if
she
should
say
in
the
hearing
of
that
assembled
company
i
love
jesus
that
jesus
looking
down
upon
her
and
hearing
how
her
timid
voice
broke
the
dishonoring
silence
would
be
displeased
would
set
it
down
among
the
long
list
of
ought
not
to
have
dones
she
tried
to
imagine
herself
speaking
to
him
in
her
closet
after
this
manner
dear
savior
i
confess
with
shame
that
i
have
brought
reproach
upon
thy
name
this
day
for
i
said
in
the
presence
of
a
great
company
of
witnesses
that
i
loved
thee
in
defiance
of
her
education
and
former
belief
upon
this
subject
ester
was
obliged
to
confess
then
and
there
that
all
this
was
extremely
ridiculous
oh
well
said
satan
it
not
exactly
of
course
but
then
it
is
very
modest
or
ladylike
and
besides
it
is
unnecessary
there
are
plenty
of
men
to
do
the
talking
but
said
common
sense
i
do
see
why
it
a
bit
more
unladylike
than
the
ladies
colloquy
at
the
lyceum
was
last
evening
there
were
more
people
present
than
are
here
tonight
and
as
for
the
men
they
are
perfectly
mum
there
seems
to
be
plenty
of
opportunity
for
somebody
well
said
satan
it
is
customary
at
least
and
people
will
think
strangely
of
you
doubtless
it
would
do
more
harm
than
good
this
most
potent
argument
people
will
think
strangely
of
you
smothered
common
sense
at
once
as
it
is
apt
to
do
and
ester
raised
her
head
from
the
bowed
position
which
it
had
occupied
during
this
whirl
of
thought
and
considered
the
question
settled
some
one
began
to
sing
and
of
all
the
words
that
have
been
chosen
came
the
most
unfortunate
ones
for
this
decision
on
my
head
he
poured
his
blessing
long
time
ago
now
he
calls
me
to
confess
him
before
i
go
my
past
life
all
vile
and
hateful
he
saved
from
sin
i
should
be
the
most
ungrateful
not
to
own
him
death
and
hell
he
bade
defiance
bore
cross
and
pain
shame
my
tongue
this
guilty
silence
and
speak
his
name
this
at
once
renewed
the
struggle
but
in
a
different
form
she
no
longer
said
ought
i
but
can
i
still
the
spell
of
silence
seemed
unbroken
save
by
here
and
there
a
voice
and
still
ester
parleyed
with
her
conscience
getting
as
far
now
as
to
say
when
jones
sits
down
if
there
is
another
silence
i
will
try
to
say
something
not
quite
meaning
though
to
do
any
such
thing
and
proving
her
word
false
by
sitting
very
still
after
jones
sat
down
though
there
was
plenty
of
silence
then
when
smith
said
a
few
words
ester
whispered
the
same
assurance
to
herself
with
exactly
the
same
result
the
something
for
which
she
had
been
longing
the
opportunity
to
show
the
world
just
where
she
stood
had
come
at
last
and
this
was
the
way
in
which
she
was
meeting
it
at
last
she
knew
by
the
heavy
thuds
which
her
heart
began
to
give
that
the
question
was
decided
that
the
very
moment
deacon
graves
sat
down
she
would
rise
whether
she
would
say
any
thing
or
not
would
depend
upon
whether
god
gave
her
any
thing
to
say
but
at
least
she
could
stand
up
for
jesus
but
parker
voice
followed
deacon
graves
and
this
was
what
he
said
am
i
to
understand
by
your
silence
that
there
is
not
a
christian
man
or
woman
in
all
this
company
who
has
an
unconverted
friend
whom
he
or
she
would
like
to
have
us
pray
for
then
the
watching
angel
of
the
covenant
came
to
the
help
of
this
trembling
struggling
ester
and
there
entered
into
her
heart
such
a
sudden
and
overwhelming
sense
of
longing
for
sadie
conversion
that
all
thought
of
what
she
would
say
and
how
she
would
say
it
and
what
people
would
think
passed
utterly
out
of
her
mind
and
rising
suddenly
she
spoke
in
clear
and
wonderfully
earnest
tones
will
you
pray
for
a
dear
dear
friend
god
sometimes
uses
very
humble
means
with
which
to
break
the
spell
of
silence
which
satan
so
often
weaves
around
christians
it
was
as
if
they
had
all
suddenly
awakened
to
a
sense
of
their
privileges
van
anden
said
in
a
voice
which
quivered
with
feeling
i
have
a
brother
in
the
profession
for
whom
i
ask
your
prayers
that
he
may
become
acquainted
with
the
great
physician
request
followed
request
for
husbands
and
wives
mothers
and
fathers
and
children
even
timid
ried
murmured
a
request
for
her
children
who
were
out
of
christ
and
when
at
last
harry
arnett
suddenly
lifted
his
handsome
boyish
head
from
its
bowed
position
and
said
in
tones
which
conveyed
the
sense
of
a
decision
pray
for
the
last
film
of
worldliness
vanished
and
there
are
those
living
who
have
reason
never
to
forget
that
meeting
is
it
your
private
opinion
that
our
good
doctor
got
up
a
streak
of
disinterested
enthusiasm
over
my
unworthy
self
this
evening
this
question
douglass
asked
of
sadie
as
they
lingered
on
the
piazza
in
the
moonlight
sadie
laughed
gleefully
i
am
sure
i
do
know
i
prepared
for
any
thing
strange
that
can
possibly
happen
mother
and
ester
between
them
have
turned
the
world
upside
down
for
me
in
case
you
are
the
happy
man
i
hope
you
are
grateful
extremely
should
be
more
so
perhaps
if
people
would
be
just
to
me
in
private
and
not
so
alarmingly
generous
in
public
how
bitter
you
are
against
van
anden
sadie
said
watching
the
lowering
brow
and
sarcastic
curve
of
the
lip
with
curious
eyes
how
much
i
should
like
to
know
precisely
what
is
the
trouble
between
you
douglass
instantly
recovered
his
suavity
do
i
appear
bitter
i
beg
your
pardon
for
exhibiting
so
ungentlemanly
a
phase
of
human
nature
yet
hypocrisy
does
move
me
to
and
then
occurred
one
of
those
sudden
periods
with
which
douglass
always
seemed
to
stop
himself
when
any
thing
not
quite
courteous
was
being
said
just
forget
that
last
sentence
he
added
it
was
unwise
and
unkind
the
trouble
between
us
is
not
worthy
of
a
thought
of
yours
i
wish
i
could
forget
it
i
believe
i
could
if
he
would
allow
me
at
this
particular
moment
the
subject
of
the
above
conversation
appeared
in
the
door
sadie
gave
a
slight
start
the
thought
that
van
anden
had
heard
the
talk
was
not
pleasant
she
need
not
have
feared
he
had
just
come
from
his
room
and
from
his
knees
he
spoke
abruptly
and
with
a
touch
of
nervousness
douglass
may
i
have
a
few
words
with
you
in
private
douglass
certainly
if
miss
sadie
will
excuse
us
was
both
prompt
and
courteous
apparently
though
the
tone
said
almost
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
done
to
what
can
i
be
indebted
for
this
honor
van
anden
led
the
way
into
the
brightly
lighted
vacant
parlor
and
there
douglass
stationed
himself
directly
under
the
gas
light
where
he
could
command
a
full
view
of
the
pale
somewhat
anxious
face
of
his
companion
and
waited
with
that
indescribable
air
made
up
of
nonchalance
and
insolence
van
anden
dashed
into
his
subject
douglass
ten
years
ago
you
did
what
you
could
to
injure
me
i
thought
then
purposely
i
think
now
that
perhaps
you
were
sincere
be
that
as
it
may
i
used
language
to
you
then
which
i
as
a
christian
man
ought
never
to
have
used
i
have
repented
it
long
ago
but
in
my
blindness
i
have
never
seen
that
i
ought
to
apologize
to
you
for
it
until
this
evening
god
has
shown
me
my
duty
douglass
i
ask
your
pardon
for
the
angry
words
i
spoke
to
you
that
day
the
gentleman
addressed
kept
his
full
bright
eyes
fixed
on
van
anden
and
answered
him
in
the
quietest
and
at
the
same
time
iciest
of
tones
you
are
certainly
very
kind
now
that
your
anger
has
had
time
to
cool
during
these
ten
years
to
accord
to
me
the
merit
of
being
sincere
now
i
was
more
in
my
conclusions
i
set
you
down
as
an
honest
blunderer
that
i
have
had
occasion
since
to
change
my
opinion
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
but
it
would
be
pleasanter
for
both
of
us
if
apologies
could
restore
our
friend
lyons
to
life
during
this
response
van
anden
face
was
a
study
it
had
passed
in
quick
succession
through
so
many
shades
of
feeling
anxiety
anger
disgust
and
finally
surprise
and
apparently
a
dawning
sense
of
a
new
development
for
he
made
the
apparently
irrelevant
reply
do
you
think
administered
that
chloroform
douglass
coolness
forsook
him
for
a
moment
who
did
he
queried
with
flashing
eyes
dr
gilbert
dr
gilbert
yes
sir
how
does
it
happen
that
i
never
knew
it
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
van
anden
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
and
spoke
in
sadness
and
weariness
i
had
no
conception
that
you
were
not
aware
of
it
until
this
moment
it
explains
in
part
what
was
strangely
mysterious
to
me
but
even
in
that
case
it
would
have
been
as
you
said
a
blunder
not
a
criminal
act
however
we
can
not
undo
past
i
desire
above
all
other
things
to
set
myself
right
in
your
eyes
as
a
christian
man
i
think
i
may
have
been
a
to
you
god
only
knows
how
bitter
is
the
thought
i
have
done
wrong
i
should
have
acknowledged
it
years
ago
i
can
only
do
it
now
again
i
ask
you
douglass
will
you
pardon
those
bitterly
spoken
words
of
mine
douglass
bowed
stiffly
with
an
increase
of
hauteur
visible
in
every
line
of
his
face
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
on
that
score
van
anden
nor
on
any
other
i
beg
you
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
my
opinion
of
christianity
is
peculiar
perhaps
but
has
not
altered
of
late
nor
is
it
likely
to
do
so
of
course
every
gentleman
is
bound
to
accept
the
apology
of
another
however
tardily
it
may
be
offered
shall
i
bid
you
sir
and
with
a
very
low
very
dignified
bow
douglass
went
back
to
the
piazza
and
sadie
and
groaning
in
spirit
over
the
tardiness
of
his
effort
van
anden
returned
to
his
room
and
prayed
that
he
might
renew
his
zeal
and
his
longing
for
the
conversion
of
that
man
soul
have
you
been
receiving
a
little
fraternal
advice
queried
sadie
her
mischievous
eyes
dancing
with
fun
over
the
supposed
discomfiture
of
one
of
the
two
gentlemen
she
cared
very
little
which
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
have
been
giving
a
little
of
that
mixture
in
a
rather
unpalatable
form
i
fear
i
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
the
world
miss
sadie
including
yourself
do
you
mean
was
sadie
demure
reply
douglass
looked
the
least
bit
annoyed
then
he
laughed
and
answered
with
quiet
grace
yes
including
even
such
an
important
individual
as
myself
however
i
have
one
merit
which
i
consider
very
rare
sincerity
sadie
face
assumed
a
half
puzzled
half
amused
expression
as
she
tried
by
the
moonlight
to
give
a
searching
look
at
the
handsome
form
leaning
against
the
pillar
opposite
her
i
wonder
if
you
as
sincere
as
you
pretend
to
be
was
her
next
complimentary
sentence
and
also
i
wonder
if
the
rest
of
the
world
are
as
unlimited
a
set
of
humbugs
as
you
suppose
how
do
you
fancy
you
happened
to
escape
getting
mixed
up
with
the
general
humbugism
of
the
world
this
parker
now
talks
as
though
he
felt
it
and
meant
it
he
is
a
fanatic
of
the
most
outrageous
sort
there
ought
to
be
a
law
forbidding
such
ranters
to
hold
forth
on
pain
of
imprisonment
for
life
douglass
said
sadie
speaking
with
grave
dignity
i
would
rather
not
hear
you
speak
of
that
old
gentleman
in
such
a
manner
he
may
be
a
fanatic
and
a
ranter
but
i
believe
he
means
it
and
i
help
respecting
him
more
than
any
moralist
that
i
ever
met
besides
i
can
not
forget
that
my
honored
father
was
among
the
despised
class
of
whom
you
speak
so
scornfully
my
dear
friend
and
douglass
tone
was
as
gentle
as
her
mother
could
have
been
forgive
me
if
i
have
pained
you
it
was
not
intentional
i
do
not
know
what
i
have
been
saying
some
unkind
things
perhaps
and
that
is
always
ungentlemanly
but
i
have
been
greatly
disturbed
this
evening
and
that
must
be
my
apology
pardon
me
for
detaining
you
so
long
in
the
evening
air
may
i
advise
you
professionally
to
go
in
immediately
may
i
advise
you
unselfishly
to
get
into
a
better
humor
with
the
world
in
general
and
van
anden
in
particular
before
you
undertake
to
talk
with
a
lady
again
sadie
answered
in
her
usual
tones
of
raillery
all
her
dignity
had
departed
meantime
if
you
would
like
to
have
unmolested
possession
of
this
piazza
to
assist
you
in
tramping
off
your
evil
spirit
you
shall
be
indulged
i
going
to
the
west
side
the
evening
air
and
i
are
excellent
friends
and
with
a
mocking
laugh
and
bow
sadie
departed
i
wonder
she
soliloquized
returning
to
gravity
the
moment
she
was
alone
i
wonder
what
that
man
has
been
saying
to
him
now
how
unhappy
these
two
gentlemen
make
themselves
it
would
be
a
consolation
to
know
right
from
wrong
i
just
wish
i
believed
in
everybody
as
i
used
to
the
idea
of
this
minister
being
a
hypocrite
absurd
but
then
the
idea
of
van
anden
being
what
he
is
well
it
a
queer
world
i
believe
i
go
to
bed
chapter
xxiv
god
way
be
it
understood
that
douglass
was
very
much
astonished
and
not
a
little
disgusted
with
himself
as
he
marched
defiantly
up
and
down
the
long
piazza
he
tried
to
analyze
his
state
of
mind
he
had
always
supposed
himself
to
be
a
man
possessed
of
keen
powers
of
discernment
and
yet
withal
exercising
considerable
charity
toward
his
erring
willing
to
overlook
faults
and
mistakes
priding
himself
not
a
little
on
the
kind
and
gentlemanly
way
in
which
he
could
meet
ruffled
human
nature
of
any
sort
in
fact
he
dwelt
on
a
sort
of
pedestal
from
the
hight
of
which
he
looked
calmly
and
excusingly
down
on
weaker
mortals
this
until
now
he
realized
in
a
confused
blundering
sort
of
way
that
his
pedestal
had
crumbled
or
that
he
had
tumbled
from
its
hight
or
at
least
that
something
new
and
strange
had
happened
for
instance
what
had
become
of
his
powers
of
discernment
here
was
this
miserable
doctor
who
had
been
one
of
the
thorns
of
his
life
whom
he
had
looked
down
upon
as
a
canting
hypocrite
was
he
after
all
mistaken
the
explanation
of
looked
like
it
he
had
been
deceived
in
that
matter
which
had
years
ago
come
between
them
he
could
see
it
very
plainly
now
in
spite
of
himself
the
doctor
earnest
manly
apology
would
come
back
and
repeat
itself
to
his
brain
and
demand
admiration
now
douglass
was
honestly
amazed
at
himself
because
he
was
not
pleased
with
this
state
of
things
why
was
he
not
glad
to
discover
that
van
anden
was
more
of
a
man
than
he
had
ever
supposed
this
would
certainly
be
in
keeping
with
the
character
of
the
courteous
unprejudiced
gentleman
that
he
had
hitherto
considered
himself
to
be
but
there
was
no
avoiding
the
fact
that
the
very
thought
of
van
anden
was
exasperating
more
so
this
evening
than
ever
before
and
the
more
his
judgment
became
convinced
that
he
had
blundered
the
more
vexed
did
he
become
confound
everybody
he
exclaimed
at
length
in
utter
disgust
what
on
earth
do
i
care
for
the
contemptible
puppy
that
i
should
waste
thought
on
him
what
possessed
the
fellow
to
come
whining
around
me
and
set
me
in
a
whirl
of
disagreeable
thought
i
ought
to
have
knocked
him
down
for
his
insufferable
impudence
in
dragging
me
out
publicly
in
that
meeting
this
he
said
aloud
but
something
made
answer
down
in
his
heart
oh
it
very
silly
of
you
to
talk
in
this
way
you
know
perfectly
well
that
van
anden
is
not
a
contemptible
puppy
at
all
he
is
a
thoroughly
educated
talented
physician
a
formidable
rival
and
you
know
it
and
he
did
whine
in
the
least
this
evening
he
made
a
very
manly
apology
for
what
was
not
so
very
bad
after
all
and
you
more
than
half
suspect
yourself
of
admiring
him
fiddlesticks
said
douglass
aloud
to
all
this
information
and
went
off
to
his
room
in
high
dudgeon
the
next
two
days
seemed
to
be
very
busy
ones
to
one
member
of
the
ried
family
douglass
sometimes
appeared
at
meal
time
and
sometimes
not
but
the
parlor
and
the
piazza
were
quite
deserted
and
even
his
own
room
saw
little
of
him
sadie
when
she
chanced
by
accident
to
meet
him
on
the
stairs
stopped
to
inquire
if
the
village
was
given
over
to
or
any
other
dire
disease
which
required
his
constant
attention
and
he
answered
her
in
tones
short
and
sharp
enough
to
have
been
van
anden
himself
it
is
given
over
to
madness
and
moved
rapidly
on
this
encounter
served
to
send
him
on
a
long
tramp
into
the
woods
that
very
afternoon
in
truth
douglass
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
at
himself
two
such
days
and
nights
as
the
last
had
been
he
hoped
never
to
see
again
it
was
as
if
all
his
pet
theories
had
deserted
him
at
a
moment
warning
and
the
very
spirit
of
darkness
taken
up
his
abode
in
their
place
go
whither
he
would
do
what
he
would
he
was
haunted
by
these
new
strange
thoughts
sometimes
he
actually
feared
that
he
at
least
was
losing
his
mind
whether
the
rest
of
the
world
were
or
not
being
an
utter
unbeliever
in
the
power
of
prayer
knowing
indeed
nothing
at
all
about
it
he
would
have
scoffed
at
the
idea
that
van
anden
impassioned
petitions
had
aught
to
do
with
him
at
this
time
had
he
known
that
at
the
very
time
in
which
he
was
marching
through
the
dreary
woods
kicking
the
red
and
yellow
leaves
from
his
path
in
sullen
gloom
ester
in
her
little
on
her
knees
was
pleading
with
god
for
his
soul
and
that
through
him
sadie
might
be
reached
i
presume
he
would
have
laughed
the
result
of
this
long
communion
with
himself
was
as
follows
that
he
had
overworked
and
underslept
that
his
nervous
system
was
disordered
that
in
the
meantime
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
attend
that
abominable
sensation
meeting
and
the
man
actually
had
wonderful
power
over
the
common
mind
and
used
his
eloquence
in
a
way
that
was
quite
calculated
to
confuse
a
not
perfectly
balanced
brain
it
was
no
wonder
then
in
his
state
of
bodily
disorder
that
the
sympathetic
mind
should
take
the
alarm
so
much
for
the
disease
now
for
the
remedy
he
would
study
less
at
least
he
would
stop
reading
half
the
night
away
he
would
begin
to
practice
some
of
his
own
preaching
and
learn
to
be
more
systematic
more
careful
of
this
wonderful
body
which
could
cause
so
much
suffering
he
would
ride
fast
and
long
above
all
he
would
keep
away
from
that
church
and
that
man
with
his
fanciful
pictures
and
skillfully
woven
words
having
determined
his
plan
of
action
he
felt
better
there
was
no
sense
he
told
himself
in
yielding
to
the
sickly
sentimentalism
which
had
bewitched
him
for
the
past
few
days
he
was
ashamed
of
it
and
would
have
no
more
of
it
he
was
master
of
his
own
mind
he
guessed
always
had
been
and
always
be
and
he
started
on
his
homeward
walk
with
a
good
deal
of
alacrity
and
much
of
his
usual
composure
settling
on
his
face
oh
would
the
gracious
spirit
which
had
been
struggling
with
him
leave
him
indeed
to
himself
o
god
pleaded
ester
give
me
this
one
soul
in
answer
to
my
prayer
for
the
sake
of
sadie
bring
this
strong
pillar
obstructing
her
way
to
thyself
for
the
sake
of
jesus
who
died
for
them
both
bring
them
both
to
yield
to
him
douglass
paused
at
the
place
where
two
roads
forked
and
mused
and
the
subject
of
his
musing
was
no
more
important
than
this
should
he
go
home
by
the
river
path
or
through
the
village
the
river
path
was
the
longer
and
it
was
growing
late
nearly
tea
time
but
if
he
took
the
main
road
he
would
pass
his
office
where
he
was
supposed
to
be
as
well
as
several
houses
where
he
ought
to
have
been
besides
meeting
probably
several
people
whom
he
would
rather
not
see
just
at
present
on
the
whole
he
decided
to
take
the
river
road
and
walked
briskly
along
quite
in
harmony
with
himself
once
more
and
enjoying
the
autumn
beauty
spread
around
him
a
little
white
speck
attracted
his
attention
he
almost
stopped
to
examine
into
it
then
smiled
at
his
curiosity
and
moved
on
a
bit
of
waste
paper
probably
he
said
to
himself
yet
what
a
curious
shape
it
was
as
if
it
had
been
carefully
folded
and
hidden
under
that
stone
suppose
i
see
what
it
is
who
knows
but
i
shall
find
a
fortune
hidden
in
it
he
turned
back
a
step
or
two
and
stooped
for
the
little
white
speck
one
corner
of
it
was
nestled
under
a
stone
it
was
a
ragged
rumpled
muddy
fragment
of
a
letter
or
an
essay
which
rain
and
wind
and
water
had
done
their
best
to
annihilate
and
finally
seeming
to
become
weary
of
their
plaything
had
tossed
it
contemptuously
on
the
shore
and
a
pitying
stone
had
rolled
down
and
covered
and
preserved
a
tiny
corner
douglass
eyed
it
curiously
trying
to
decipher
the
lines
and
being
in
a
dreamy
mood
wondered
meanwhile
what
young
fair
hand
had
penned
the
words
and
what
of
joy
or
sadness
filled
them
scarcely
a
word
was
readable
at
least
nothing
that
would
gratify
his
curiosity
until
he
turned
the
bit
of
leaf
and
the
first
line
which
the
stone
had
hidden
shone
out
distinctly
sometimes
i
can
not
help
asking
myself
why
i
was
made
here
the
corner
was
torn
off
and
whether
that
was
the
end
of
the
original
sentence
or
not
it
was
the
end
to
him
god
sometimes
uses
very
simple
means
with
which
to
confound
the
wisdom
of
this
world
such
a
sudden
and
extraordinary
revulsion
of
feeling
as
swept
over
douglass
he
had
never
dreamed
of
before
he
did
not
stop
to
question
the
strangeness
of
his
state
of
mind
nor
why
that
bit
of
soiled
torn
paper
should
possess
so
fearful
a
power
over
him
he
did
not
even
realize
at
the
moment
that
it
was
connected
with
this
bewilderment
he
only
knew
that
the
foundation
upon
which
he
had
been
building
for
years
seemed
suddenly
to
have
been
torn
from
under
him
by
invisible
hands
and
left
his
feet
sinking
slowly
down
on
nothing
and
his
inmost
soul
took
suddenly
up
that
solemn
question
with
which
he
had
never
before
troubled
his
logical
brain
i
can
not
help
asking
myself
why
i
was
made
there
was
only
one
other
readable
word
on
that
paper
turn
it
whichever
way
he
would
and
that
word
was
god
and
he
started
and
shivered
when
his
eye
met
this
as
if
some
awful
voice
had
spoken
it
to
his
ear
what
unaccountable
witchcraft
has
taken
possession
of
me
he
muttered
at
length
and
turning
suddenly
he
sat
himself
down
on
an
old
decaying
log
by
the
river
side
and
gave
himself
up
to
real
honest
solemn
thought
where
is
dr
douglass
queried
julia
appearing
at
the
door
just
at
tea
time
there
is
a
boy
at
the
door
says
they
want
him
at
judge
beldon
this
very
instant
he
answered
sadie
solemnly
pausing
in
the
work
of
arranging
cups
and
saucers
it
my
private
opinion
that
he
has
been
and
gone
and
hung
himself
he
passed
the
window
about
one
looking
precisely
as
i
should
suppose
a
man
would
who
was
about
to
commit
that
interesting
act
since
which
time
i
answered
the
bell
seventeen
times
to
give
the
same
melancholy
story
of
his
whereabouts
my
exclaimed
the
literal
julia
hurrying
back
to
the
boy
at
the
door
she
comprehended
her
sister
sufficiently
to
have
no
faith
in
the
hanging
statement
but
honestly
believed
in
the
seventeen
sick
people
who
were
waiting
for
the
doctor
the
church
was
very
full
again
that
evening
sadie
had
at
first
declared
herself
utterly
unequal
to
another
meeting
that
week
but
had
finally
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
into
going
and
had
nearly
been
the
cause
of
poor
julia
disgrace
because
of
the
astonished
look
which
she
assumed
as
douglass
came
down
the
aisle
with
his
usual
quiet
composure
of
manner
and
took
the
seat
directly
in
front
of
them
the
sermon
was
concluded
the
text
see
i
have
set
before
thee
this
day
life
and
good
death
and
evil
had
been
dwelt
upon
in
such
a
manner
that
it
seemed
to
some
as
if
the
aged
servant
of
god
had
verily
been
shown
a
glimpse
of
the
two
unseen
worlds
waiting
for
every
soul
and
was
painting
from
actual
memory
the
picture
for
them
to
look
upon
that
most
solemn
of
all
solemn
hymns
had
just
been
sung
there
is
a
time
we
know
not
when
a
point
we
know
not
where
that
marks
the
destiny
of
men
glory
and
despair
there
is
a
line
by
us
unseen
that
crosses
every
path
the
hidden
boundary
between
god
mercy
and
his
wrath
silence
had
but
fairly
settled
on
the
waiting
congregation
when
a
strong
firm
voice
broke
in
upon
it
and
the
speaker
said
i
believe
in
my
soul
that
i
have
met
that
point
and
crossed
that
line
this
day
i
surely
met
god
mercy
and
his
wrath
face
to
face
and
struggled
in
their
power
your
hymn
says
cross
that
boundary
is
to
die
but
i
thank
god
that
there
are
two
sides
to
it
i
feel
that
i
have
been
standing
on
the
very
line
that
my
feet
had
slipped
i
step
over
on
to
mercy
side
reckon
me
henceforth
among
those
who
have
chosen
life
amen
said
the
veteran
minister
with
radiant
face
thank
god
said
the
earnest
pastor
with
quivering
lip
two
heads
were
suddenly
bowed
in
the
silent
ecstasy
of
prayer
they
were
ester
and
van
anden
as
for
sadie
she
sat
straight
and
still
as
if
petrified
with
amazement
as
she
felt
herself
to
be
for
the
strong
firm
voice
belonged
to
douglass
an
hour
later
van
anden
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
long
parlor
with
quick
excited
steps
waiting
for
he
hardly
knew
what
when
a
shadow
fell
between
him
and
the
gaslight
he
glanced
up
suddenly
and
his
eyes
met
douglass
who
had
placed
himself
in
precisely
the
same
position
in
which
he
had
stood
when
they
had
met
there
before
van
anden
started
forward
and
the
two
gentlemen
clasped
hands
as
they
had
never
in
their
lives
done
before
douglass
broke
the
beautiful
silence
first
with
earnestly
spoken
words
doctor
will
you
forgive
all
the
past
and
van
anden
answered
oh
my
brother
in
christ
as
for
ester
she
prayed
in
her
thankfully
for
douglass
more
hopefully
for
sadie
and
knew
not
that
a
corner
of
the
poor
little
letter
which
had
slipped
from
julia
hand
and
floated
down
the
stream
one
summer
morning
thereby
causing
her
such
a
miserable
day
was
lying
at
that
moment
in
counted
as
the
most
precious
of
all
his
precious
bits
of
paper
verily
his
ways
are
not
as
our
ways
chapter
xxv
sadie
surrounded
oh
said
sadie
with
a
merry
toss
of
her
brown
curls
waste
any
more
precious
breath
over
me
i
beg
i
an
unfortunate
case
not
worth
struggling
for
just
let
me
have
a
few
hours
of
peace
once
more
if
you
promise
not
to
say
again
to
me
i
promise
not
to
laugh
at
you
once
after
this
long
spasm
of
goodness
has
quieted
and
you
have
each
descended
to
your
usual
level
once
more
sadie
said
ester
in
a
low
shocked
tone
you
think
we
are
all
hypocrites
and
mean
not
a
bit
of
this
by
means
my
dear
sister
of
charity
at
least
not
all
of
you
i
a
firm
believer
in
diseases
of
all
sorts
this
is
one
of
the
violent
kind
of
highly
contagious
diseases
they
must
run
their
course
you
know
i
have
not
lived
in
the
house
with
two
learned
physicians
all
this
time
without
learning
that
fact
but
i
consider
this
very
nearly
at
its
height
and
live
in
hourly
expectation
of
the
but
my
dear
i
do
think
you
need
worry
about
me
in
the
least
i
do
believe
i
a
fit
subject
for
such
trouble
you
know
i
never
took
nor
measles
though
i
have
been
exposed
a
great
many
times
to
this
ester
only
replied
by
a
low
tremulous
do
sadie
please
sadie
turned
a
pair
of
mirthful
eyes
upon
her
for
a
moment
and
noting
with
wonder
the
pale
anxious
face
and
quivering
lip
of
her
sister
seemed
suddenly
sobered
ester
she
said
quietly
i
do
think
you
are
good
i
positively
i
believe
you
are
thoroughly
in
earnest
but
i
think
you
have
been
through
some
very
severe
scenes
of
late
sickness
and
watching
and
death
and
your
nerves
are
completely
unstrung
i
do
wonder
at
your
state
of
feeling
but
you
will
get
over
it
in
a
little
while
and
be
yourself
again
oh
said
ester
tremulously
i
pray
god
i
may
be
myself
again
not
the
old
self
that
you
mean
you
will
sadie
answered
with
roguish
positiveness
things
will
go
the
fire
wo
burn
and
the
kettle
wo
boil
and
the
will
tip
over
and
all
sorts
of
mischievous
things
will
go
on
happening
after
a
little
bit
just
as
usual
and
you
will
feel
like
having
a
general
smash
up
of
every
thing
in
spite
of
all
these
meetings
ester
sighed
heavily
the
old
difficulty
again
things
would
not
be
undone
the
weeds
which
she
had
been
carelessly
sowing
during
all
these
past
years
had
taken
deep
root
and
would
not
give
place
after
a
moment
silence
she
spoke
again
sadie
answer
me
just
one
question
what
do
you
think
of
dr
douglass
sadie
face
darkened
ominously
never
mind
what
i
think
of
she
answered
in
short
sharp
tones
and
abruptly
left
the
room
what
she
think
of
him
was
this
that
he
had
become
that
which
he
had
affected
to
consider
the
most
despicable
thing
on
earth
a
hypocrite
remember
she
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
power
of
the
spirit
of
god
over
a
human
soul
she
had
no
conception
of
how
so
mighty
a
change
could
be
wrought
in
the
space
of
a
few
hours
so
her
only
solution
of
the
mystery
was
that
to
serve
some
end
which
he
had
in
view
douglass
had
chosen
to
assume
a
new
character
later
on
that
same
day
sadie
encountered
douglass
rather
she
went
to
the
side
piazza
equipped
for
a
walk
and
he
came
eagerly
from
the
west
end
to
speak
with
her
miss
sadie
i
have
been
watching
for
you
i
have
a
few
words
that
are
burning
to
be
said
proceed
said
sadie
standing
with
demurely
folded
hands
and
a
mock
gravity
in
her
roguish
eyes
i
want
to
do
justice
at
this
late
day
to
van
anden
i
misjudged
him
wronged
him
perhaps
prejudiced
you
against
him
i
want
to
undo
my
work
some
things
can
be
done
more
easily
than
they
can
be
undone
was
sadie
grave
and
dignified
reply
you
certainly
have
done
your
best
to
prejudice
me
against
van
anden
not
only
but
against
all
other
persons
who
hold
his
peculiar
views
and
you
have
succeeded
splendidly
i
congratulate
you
that
look
of
absolute
pain
which
she
had
seen
once
or
twice
on
this
man
face
swept
over
it
now
as
he
answered
her
i
know
i
have
been
blind
and
stupid
any
thing
you
will
most
bitterly
do
i
regret
it
now
most
eager
am
i
to
make
reparation
sadie
only
answer
was
what
a
capital
actor
you
would
make
douglass
are
you
sure
you
have
not
mistaken
your
vocation
i
know
what
you
think
of
me
this
with
an
almost
quivering
lip
and
a
voice
strangely
humble
and
as
unlike
as
possible
to
any
which
she
had
ever
heard
from
douglass
before
you
think
i
am
playing
a
part
though
what
my
motive
could
be
i
can
not
imagine
can
you
but
i
do
solemnly
assure
you
that
if
ever
i
was
sincere
in
any
thing
in
all
my
life
i
am
now
concerning
this
matter
there
is
a
most
unfortunate
in
the
way
doctor
you
see
the
trouble
is
i
have
very
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
you
ever
were
sincere
in
any
thing
in
your
life
as
to
motives
a
anybody
likes
to
try
his
power
you
will
observe
that
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
the
world
the
doctor
did
not
notice
the
quotation
of
his
favorite
expression
but
answered
with
a
touch
of
his
accustomed
dignity
i
may
have
deserved
this
treatment
at
your
hands
miss
sadie
doubtless
i
have
although
i
am
not
conscious
of
ever
having
said
to
you
any
thing
which
i
did
not
i
i
have
been
a
i
am
willing
yes
and
anxious
to
own
it
but
there
are
surely
some
among
your
acquaintances
whom
you
can
trust
if
you
can
not
me
i
sadie
interrupted
him
for
instance
that
fanatic
of
the
most
objectionable
stamp
the
man
who
douglass
thought
not
three
days
ago
ought
to
be
bound
by
law
to
keep
the
peace
i
suppose
you
would
have
me
unhesitatingly
receive
every
word
he
says
douglass
face
brightened
instantly
and
he
spoke
eagerly
i
remember
those
words
miss
sadie
and
just
how
honestly
i
spoke
them
and
just
how
bitterly
i
felt
when
i
spoke
them
and
i
have
no
more
sure
proof
that
this
thing
is
of
god
than
i
have
in
noting
the
wonderful
change
which
has
come
over
my
feelings
in
regard
to
that
blessed
man
i
pray
god
that
he
may
be
permitted
to
speak
to
your
soul
with
the
tremendous
power
that
he
has
to
mine
oh
sadie
i
have
led
you
astray
may
i
not
help
you
back
i
am
not
a
douglass
to
be
whirled
about
by
every
wind
of
expediency
besides
i
am
familiar
with
one
verse
in
the
bible
of
which
you
seem
never
to
have
heard
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
you
have
sowed
well
and
faithfully
be
content
with
your
harvest
i
do
not
know
what
the
pale
grave
lips
would
have
answered
to
this
mocking
spirit
for
at
that
moment
van
anden
and
the
black
ponies
whizzed
around
the
corner
and
halted
before
the
gate
sadie
said
the
doctor
are
you
in
the
mood
for
a
ride
i
have
five
miles
to
drive
van
anden
answered
sadie
promptly
the
last
time
you
and
i
took
a
ride
together
we
quarreled
precisely
said
the
doctor
bowing
low
let
us
take
another
now
and
make
up
very
well
was
the
gleeful
answer
which
he
received
and
in
another
minute
they
were
off
for
the
first
mile
or
two
he
kept
a
tight
rein
and
let
the
ponies
skim
over
the
ground
in
the
liveliest
fashion
during
which
time
very
little
talking
was
done
after
that
he
slackened
his
speed
and
leaning
back
in
the
carriage
addressed
himself
to
sadie
now
we
are
ready
to
make
up
how
shall
we
commence
asked
sadie
gravely
who
quarreled
answered
the
doctor
sententiously
well
said
sadie
i
understand
what
you
are
waiting
for
you
think
i
was
very
rude
and
unladylike
in
my
replies
to
you
during
that
last
interesting
ride
we
took
you
think
i
jumped
at
unwarrantable
conclusions
and
used
some
unnecessarily
sharp
words
i
think
so
myself
and
if
it
will
be
of
any
service
to
you
to
know
it
i
mind
telling
you
in
the
least
that
is
a
very
excellent
beginning
answered
the
doctor
heartily
i
think
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
matter
all
settled
now
for
my
part
it
wo
sound
as
well
as
yours
because
however
blunderingly
i
may
have
said
what
i
did
i
said
it
honestly
in
good
faith
and
with
a
good
and
pure
motive
but
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
say
in
equal
honesty
that
i
believe
i
was
that
douglass
was
never
so
little
worthy
of
regard
as
i
supposed
him
to
be
and
that
nothing
could
have
more
rejoiced
my
heart
than
the
noble
stand
which
he
has
so
recently
taken
indeed
his
conduct
has
been
so
noble
that
i
feel
honored
by
his
acquaintance
he
was
interrupted
by
a
mischievous
laugh
a
mutual
admiration
society
said
sadie
in
her
most
mocking
tone
did
you
and
douglass
have
a
private
rehearsal
you
interrupted
him
in
a
similar
rhapsody
over
your
perfections
instead
of
seeming
annoyed
van
anden
face
glowed
with
pleasure
did
he
explain
to
you
our
misunderstanding
he
asked
eagerly
that
was
very
noble
in
him
of
he
is
the
soul
of
nobility
a
villain
yesterday
and
a
saint
i
do
understand
such
marvelously
rapid
changes
doctor
i
know
you
do
the
doctor
answered
quietly
although
you
have
exaggerated
both
terms
yet
there
is
a
great
and
marvelous
change
which
must
be
experienced
to
be
understood
will
you
never
seek
it
for
yourself
sadie
i
presume
i
never
shall
as
i
very
much
doubt
the
existence
of
any
such
phenomenon
the
doctor
appeared
neither
shocked
nor
surprised
but
favored
her
with
a
cool
and
quiet
reply
oh
no
you
do
doubt
it
in
the
least
do
try
to
make
yourself
out
that
foolish
and
unreasonable
creature
an
unbeliever
in
what
is
as
clear
to
a
thinking
mind
as
is
the
sun
at
noonday
you
and
i
have
no
need
to
enter
into
an
argument
concerning
this
matter
you
have
seen
some
unwise
and
inconsistent
acts
in
many
who
are
called
by
the
name
of
christian
you
imagine
that
they
have
staggered
your
belief
in
the
verity
of
the
thing
itself
yet
it
is
not
so
you
had
a
dear
father
who
lived
and
died
in
the
faith
and
you
no
more
doubt
the
fact
that
he
is
in
heaven
brought
there
by
the
power
of
the
savior
in
whom
he
trusted
than
you
doubt
your
own
existence
at
this
moment
sadie
sat
silenced
and
grave
she
was
very
rarely
either
perhaps
van
anden
was
the
one
person
who
could
have
thus
subdued
her
but
in
her
inmost
heart
she
felt
his
words
to
be
true
that
dear
father
whose
weary
suffering
life
had
been
one
long
evidence
to
the
truth
of
the
religion
which
he
professed
yes
it
was
so
she
no
more
doubted
that
he
was
at
this
moment
in
that
blessed
heaven
toward
which
his
hopes
had
so
constantly
tended
than
she
doubted
the
shining
of
that
day
sun
so
he
being
dead
yet
spoke
to
her
besides
her
keen
judgment
had
of
late
settled
back
upon
the
belief
that
van
anden
lived
a
life
that
would
bear
watching
a
true
earnest
manly
life
also
that
he
was
a
man
not
likely
to
be
deceived
so
sitting
back
there
in
the
carriage
and
appearing
to
look
at
nothing
and
be
interested
in
nothing
she
allowed
herself
to
take
in
again
the
firm
conviction
that
whatever
most
lives
were
there
was
always
that
father
safe
in
the
christian
heaven
and
there
were
besides
some
few
a
very
few
she
thought
but
there
were
still
living
whom
she
knew
yes
actually
were
fitting
for
that
same
safe
place
no
sadie
had
stood
upon
the
brink
was
standing
there
still
indeed
but
reason
and
the
father
still
kept
her
from
toppling
over
into
the
chasm
of
settled
unbelief
blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
yea
saith
the
spirit
that
they
may
rest
from
their
labors
and
their
works
do
follow
them
but
something
must
be
said
sadie
was
not
going
to
sit
there
and
allow
van
anden
to
imagine
that
she
was
utterly
quieted
and
conquered
she
would
rather
quarrel
with
him
than
have
that
he
had
espoused
douglass
cause
so
emphatically
let
him
argue
for
him
now
there
was
nothing
like
a
good
sharp
argument
to
destroy
the
effect
of
unpleasant
personal
questions
so
she
blazed
into
sudden
indignation
i
think
douglass
is
a
hypocrite
nothing
could
have
been
more
composed
than
the
tone
in
which
she
was
answered
very
well
what
then
this
question
was
difficult
to
answer
and
sadie
remaining
silent
her
companion
continued
smith
is
a
drunkard
therefore
i
will
be
a
thief
is
that
miss
sadie
ried
logic
i
do
see
the
point
do
you
was
that
exclamation
concerning
douglass
a
bit
of
hiding
behind
the
supposed
sin
of
another
a
sort
of
a
reason
why
you
were
not
a
christian
because
somebody
else
pretended
to
be
is
that
sound
logic
sadie
when
your
next
neighbor
in
class
peeps
in
her
book
and
thereby
disgraces
herself
and
becomes
a
hypocrite
do
you
straightway
declare
that
you
will
study
no
more
you
see
it
is
fashionable
in
talking
of
this
matter
of
religion
to
drag
out
the
shortcomings
and
inconsistencies
of
others
and
try
to
make
of
them
a
garment
to
covet
our
own
sins
but
it
is
very
senseless
after
all
and
you
will
observe
is
never
done
in
the
discussion
of
any
other
question
clearly
sadie
must
talk
in
a
way
with
this
straightforward
man
if
she
talked
at
all
her
resolution
was
suddenly
taken
to
say
for
once
just
what
she
meant
and
a
very
grave
and
thoughtful
pair
of
eyes
were
raised
to
meet
the
doctor
when
next
she
spoke
i
think
of
these
things
sometimes
doctor
and
though
a
great
deal
of
it
seems
to
be
humbug
it
is
as
you
say
i
know
are
sincere
and
i
know
there
is
a
right
way
i
have
been
more
than
half
tempted
many
times
during
the
last
few
weeks
to
discover
for
myself
the
secret
of
power
but
i
am
deterred
by
certain
considerations
which
you
would
doubtless
think
very
absurd
but
which
joined
with
the
inspiration
which
i
receive
from
the
ridiculous
inconsistencies
of
others
have
been
sufficient
to
deter
me
hitherto
would
you
mind
telling
me
some
of
the
considerations
and
the
moment
sadie
began
to
talk
honestly
the
doctor
tones
lost
their
coolness
and
expressed
a
kind
and
thoughtful
interest
no
she
said
hesitatingly
i
do
know
that
i
need
but
you
will
not
understand
them
for
instance
if
i
were
a
christian
i
should
have
to
give
up
one
of
my
favorite
amusements
almost
a
passion
you
know
dancing
is
with
me
and
i
am
not
ready
to
yield
it
why
should
you
feel
obliged
to
do
so
if
you
were
a
christian
sadie
gave
him
the
benefit
of
a
very
searching
look
do
think
i
would
be
she
queried
after
a
moment
silence
i
have
said
what
i
thought
on
that
subject
but
i
feel
sure
that
it
is
not
the
question
for
you
to
decide
at
present
first
settle
the
one
of
your
personal
acceptation
of
christ
and
then
it
will
be
time
to
decide
the
other
matter
for
or
against
as
your
conscience
may
dictate
oh
but
said
sadie
positively
i
know
very
well
what
my
conscience
would
dictate
and
i
am
not
ready
for
it
is
dancing
an
innocent
amusement
for
yes
but
not
for
a
christian
does
the
bible
lay
down
one
code
of
laws
for
you
and
another
for
christians
i
think
so
it
says
not
conformed
to
the
world
granted
but
does
it
anywhere
say
to
those
who
are
of
the
world
have
a
right
to
do
just
what
you
like
that
direction
does
not
apply
to
you
at
all
it
is
all
intended
for
those
poor
christians
van
anden
said
sadie
with
dignity
do
you
think
there
should
be
a
difference
between
christians
and
those
who
are
not
undoubtedly
i
do
do
think
that
every
person
ought
or
ought
to
be
a
christian
sadie
was
silent
and
a
little
indignant
after
a
moment
she
spoke
again
this
time
with
a
touch
of
hauteur
i
think
you
understand
what
i
mean
doctor
though
you
would
not
admit
it
for
the
world
i
do
suppose
i
feel
very
deeply
on
the
subject
else
i
would
not
advance
so
trivial
an
excuse
but
this
is
honestly
my
state
of
mind
whenever
i
think
about
the
matter
at
all
this
thing
comes
up
for
consideration
i
think
it
would
be
very
foolish
for
me
to
argue
against
dancing
for
i
do
know
much
about
the
arguments
and
care
less
i
know
only
this
much
that
there
is
a
very
distinctly
defined
inconsistency
between
a
profession
of
religion
and
dancing
visible
very
generally
to
the
eyes
of
those
who
make
no
profession
the
other
class
do
seem
so
able
to
see
it
but
there
exists
very
generally
among
us
worldlings
a
disposition
to
laugh
a
little
over
dancing
christians
whether
this
is
a
inconsistency
or
only
a
foolish
prejudice
on
our
part
i
have
never
taken
the
trouble
to
try
to
determine
and
it
would
make
little
material
difference
which
it
was
it
is
enough
for
me
that
such
is
the
case
and
it
makes
it
very
plain
to
me
that
if
i
were
an
honest
professor
of
that
religion
which
leads
one
of
its
teachers
to
say
will
eat
no
meat
while
the
world
stands
if
it
makes
his
brother
to
offend
i
should
be
obliged
to
give
up
my
dancing
but
since
i
am
not
one
of
that
class
and
thus
have
no
such
influence
i
can
see
no
possible
harm
in
my
favorite
amusement
and
am
not
ready
to
give
it
up
and
that
is
what
i
mean
by
its
being
innocent
for
me
and
not
innocent
for
professing
christians
van
anden
made
no
sort
of
reply
if
sadie
could
judge
from
his
face
he
seemed
to
have
grown
weary
of
the
whole
subject
he
leaned
back
in
his
carriage
and
let
the
reins
fall
loosely
and
carelessly
his
next
proceeding
was
most
astounding
coolly
possessing
himself
of
one
of
the
small
gloved
hands
that
lay
idly
in
sadie
lap
he
said
in
a
quiet
tone
sadie
would
you
allow
me
to
put
my
arm
around
you
in
an
instant
the
indignant
blood
surged
in
waves
over
sadie
face
the
hand
was
angrily
withdrawn
and
the
graceful
form
drawn
to
an
erect
hight
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
freezing
tone
of
astonished
indignation
in
which
she
ejaculated
van
anden
just
what
i
expected
returned
that
gentleman
in
a
composed
manner
bestowing
a
look
of
entire
satisfaction
upon
his
irate
companion
and
yet
sadie
i
hope
you
will
pardon
my
obtuseness
but
i
positively
can
not
see
why
if
it
is
proper
and
courteous
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
who
am
a
friend
of
ten
years
standing
should
not
enjoy
the
same
privilege
which
you
accord
to
fred
kenmore
to
whom
you
were
introduced
last
week
and
with
whom
i
heard
you
say
you
danced
five
times
sadie
looked
confused
and
annoyed
but
finally
she
laughed
for
she
had
the
good
sense
to
see
the
folly
of
doing
any
thing
else
under
existing
circumstances
that
is
the
point
which
puzzles
me
at
present
continued
the
doctor
in
a
kind
grave
tone
i
do
not
understand
how
young
ladies
of
refinement
can
permit
under
certain
circumstances
and
often
from
comparative
strangers
attentions
which
under
other
circumstances
they
repel
with
becoming
indignation
wo
you
consider
the
apparent
inconsistency
a
little
it
is
the
only
suggestion
which
i
wish
to
offer
on
the
question
at
present
when
you
have
settled
that
other
important
matter
this
thing
will
present
itself
to
your
eyes
in
other
and
more
startling
aspects
meantime
this
is
the
house
at
which
i
must
call
will
you
hold
my
horses
miss
sadie
while
i
dispatch
matters
within
chapter
xxvi
confusion
consequence
but
the
autumn
days
were
not
bright
and
glowing
and
glorious
one
morning
it
rained
not
a
soft
silent
and
warm
rain
but
a
gusty
windy
turbulent
one
a
rain
that
drove
into
windows
ever
so
slightly
raised
and
hurled
itself
angrily
into
your
face
whenever
you
ventured
to
open
a
door
it
was
a
day
in
which
fires
did
like
to
burn
but
smoldered
and
sizzled
and
smoked
and
people
went
around
shivering
their
shoulders
shrugged
up
under
little
dingy
unbecoming
shawls
and
the
clouds
were
low
and
gray
and
heavy
and
every
thing
and
every
body
seemed
generally
out
of
sorts
ester
was
no
exception
the
toothache
had
kept
her
awake
during
the
night
and
one
cheek
was
puffy
and
stiff
in
the
morning
and
one
tooth
still
snarled
threateningly
whenever
the
slightest
whisper
of
a
draught
came
to
it
the
exalted
views
of
life
and
duty
which
had
held
possession
of
her
during
the
past
few
weeks
seemed
suddenly
to
have
deserted
her
in
short
her
body
had
gained
that
mortifying
ascendency
over
the
soul
which
it
will
sometimes
accomplish
and
all
her
hopes
and
aims
and
enthusiasms
seemed
blotted
out
things
in
the
kitchen
were
uncomfortable
maggie
had
seized
on
this
occasion
for
having
the
mumps
and
acting
upon
the
advice
of
her
sympathizing
mistress
had
pinned
a
hot
flannel
around
her
face
and
gone
to
bed
the
same
unselfish
counsel
had
been
given
to
ester
but
she
had
just
grace
enough
left
to
refuse
to
desert
the
camp
when
dinner
must
be
in
readiness
for
people
in
spite
of
nerves
and
teeth
just
here
however
the
supply
failed
her
and
she
worked
in
ominous
gloom
julia
had
been
pressed
into
service
and
was
stoning
raisins
or
eating
them
a
close
observer
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
discover
which
she
was
certainly
rasping
the
nerves
of
her
sister
in
a
variety
of
those
endless
ways
by
which
a
thoughtless
restless
questioning
child
can
almost
distract
a
troubled
brain
ester
endured
with
what
patience
she
could
the
ceaseless
drafts
upon
her
and
worked
at
the
interminable
cookies
with
commendable
zeal
alfred
came
with
a
bang
and
a
whistle
and
held
open
the
side
door
while
he
talked
in
rushed
the
spiteful
wind
and
all
the
teeth
in
sympathy
with
the
aching
one
set
up
an
immediate
growl
mother
i
do
see
any
why
where
is
mother
questioned
alfred
and
was
answered
with
an
emphatic
shut
that
door
well
but
said
alfred
i
want
mother
i
say
ester
will
you
give
me
a
cookie
no
answered
ester
with
energy
did
you
hear
me
tell
you
to
shut
that
door
this
instant
well
now
do
bite
a
fellow
and
alfred
looked
curiously
at
his
sister
meantime
the
door
closed
with
a
heavy
bang
mother
say
mother
he
continued
as
his
mother
emerged
from
the
pantry
i
see
any
thing
of
that
hammer
i
looked
mother
ca
i
have
one
of
ester
cookies
i
awful
hungry
why
i
guess
so
if
you
are
really
suffering
try
again
for
the
hammer
my
boy
do
let
a
poor
little
hammer
get
the
better
of
you
well
said
alfred
i
wo
meaning
that
it
should
answer
the
latter
part
of
the
sentence
and
seizing
a
cookie
he
bestowed
a
triumphant
look
upon
ester
and
a
loving
one
upon
his
mother
and
vanished
amid
a
renewal
of
the
whistle
and
bang
this
little
scene
did
not
serve
to
help
ester
she
rolled
away
vigorously
at
the
dough
but
felt
some
way
disturbed
and
outraged
and
finally
gave
vent
to
her
feeling
in
a
peremptory
order
julia
do
eat
another
raisin
you
made
away
with
about
half
of
them
now
julia
looked
aggrieved
mother
lets
me
eat
raisins
when
i
pick
them
over
for
her
was
her
defense
to
which
she
received
no
other
reply
than
keep
your
elbows
off
the
table
then
there
was
silence
and
industry
for
some
minutes
presently
julia
recovered
her
composure
and
commenced
with
say
ester
what
makes
you
prick
little
holes
all
over
your
biscuits
to
make
them
rise
better
does
every
thing
rise
better
after
it
is
pricked
sadie
was
paring
apples
at
the
end
table
and
interposed
at
this
point
if
you
find
that
to
be
the
case
julia
you
must
be
very
careful
after
this
or
we
shall
have
ester
pricking
you
when
you
do
in
time
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
julia
suspected
that
she
was
being
made
a
dupe
of
and
appealed
to
her
older
sister
ester
you
prick
them
so
they
will
rise
better
of
course
i
told
you
so
did
i
well
but
why
does
that
help
them
any
ca
they
get
up
unless
you
make
holes
in
them
and
what
is
all
the
reason
for
it
now
these
were
not
easy
questions
to
answer
especially
to
a
girl
with
the
toothache
and
ester
answer
was
not
much
to
the
point
julia
i
declare
you
are
enough
to
distract
one
if
you
ask
any
more
questions
i
shall
certainly
send
you
up
stairs
out
of
the
way
her
scientific
investigations
thus
nipped
in
the
bud
julia
returned
again
to
silence
and
raisins
until
the
vigorous
beating
of
some
eggs
roused
anew
the
spirit
of
inquiry
she
leaned
eagerly
forward
with
a
say
ester
please
tell
me
why
the
whites
all
foam
and
get
thick
when
you
stir
them
just
like
beautiful
white
soapsuds
and
she
rested
her
elbow
covered
with
its
blue
sleeve
plump
into
the
platter
containing
the
beaten
yolks
you
must
remember
ester
but
even
then
i
regret
to
say
that
this
disaster
culminated
in
a
decided
box
on
the
ear
for
poor
julia
and
in
her
being
sent
weeping
up
stairs
sadie
looked
up
with
a
wicked
laugh
in
her
bright
eyes
and
said
demurely
you
did
keep
your
promise
ester
and
let
me
live
in
peace
so
i
need
keep
mine
and
i
consider
you
pretty
well
out
of
the
spasm
which
has
lasted
for
so
many
days
sadie
i
am
really
ashamed
of
you
this
was
ried
grave
reproving
voice
and
she
added
kindly
ester
poor
child
i
wish
you
would
wrap
your
face
up
in
something
warm
and
lie
down
awhile
i
am
afraid
you
are
suffering
a
great
deal
poor
ester
it
had
been
a
hard
day
late
in
the
afternoon
as
she
stood
at
the
table
and
cut
the
bread
and
cake
and
cheese
and
cold
meat
for
tea
when
the
sun
had
made
a
rift
in
the
clouds
and
was
peeping
in
for
when
the
throbbing
nerves
had
grown
quiet
once
more
she
looked
back
upon
this
weary
day
in
shame
and
pain
how
very
little
her
noble
resolves
and
efforts
and
advances
had
been
worth
after
all
how
far
back
she
seemed
to
have
gone
in
that
one
day
not
strength
enough
to
bear
even
the
little
crosses
that
befell
in
an
ordinarily
quiet
life
how
she
had
lost
the
influence
over
alfred
and
julia
by
a
few
cross
words
how
much
reason
she
had
given
sadie
to
think
that
her
attempts
at
following
the
master
were
after
all
only
spasmodic
and
visionary
but
ester
had
been
to
that
little
up
stairs
in
search
of
help
and
forgiveness
and
now
she
clearly
saw
there
was
something
to
do
besides
mourn
over
her
failures
it
was
hard
to
do
it
too
ester
spirit
was
proud
and
it
was
very
humbling
to
confess
herself
in
the
wrong
she
hesitated
and
shrank
from
the
work
until
she
finally
grew
ashamed
of
herself
for
that
and
at
last
without
turning
her
head
from
her
work
or
giving
her
resolve
time
to
falter
she
called
to
the
twins
who
were
occupying
seats
in
one
of
the
windows
and
talking
low
and
soberly
to
each
other
children
come
here
a
moment
will
you
the
two
had
been
very
shy
of
ester
since
the
morning
trials
and
were
at
that
moment
sympathizing
with
each
other
in
a
manner
uncomplimentary
to
her
however
they
slid
down
from
their
perch
and
slowly
answered
her
call
ester
glanced
up
as
they
entered
the
storeroom
and
then
went
on
cutting
her
cheese
but
speaking
in
low
gentle
tones
i
want
to
tell
you
two
how
sorry
i
am
that
i
spoke
so
crossly
and
unkindly
to
you
this
morning
it
was
very
wrong
in
me
i
thought
i
never
should
displease
jesus
so
again
but
i
did
you
see
and
now
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
and
i
want
you
to
forgive
me
alfred
looked
aghast
this
was
an
ester
that
he
had
never
seen
before
and
he
did
know
what
to
say
he
wriggled
the
toes
of
his
boots
together
and
looked
down
at
them
in
puzzled
wonder
at
last
he
faltered
out
i
did
know
your
cheek
ached
till
mother
told
me
or
else
i
have
shut
the
door
right
straight
i
ought
to
cheek
or
no
cheek
this
last
in
a
lower
tone
and
more
looking
down
at
his
boots
it
was
new
work
for
alfred
this
voluntarily
owning
himself
in
the
wrong
julia
burst
forth
eagerly
and
i
was
very
careless
and
naughty
to
keep
putting
my
elbows
on
the
table
after
you
had
told
me
not
to
and
i
am
ever
so
sorry
that
i
made
you
such
a
lot
of
trouble
well
then
said
ester
we
all
forgive
each
other
shall
we
and
begin
over
again
and
children
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
trying
to
please
jesus
and
when
i
fail
it
is
because
of
my
own
wicked
heart
not
because
there
is
any
need
of
it
if
i
tried
harder
and
i
want
you
to
know
how
anxious
i
am
that
you
should
love
this
same
jesus
now
while
you
are
young
and
get
him
to
help
you
their
mother
called
the
children
at
this
moment
and
ester
dismissed
them
each
with
a
kiss
there
was
a
little
rustle
in
the
and
sadie
whom
nobody
knew
was
down
stairs
emerged
therefrom
with
suspiciously
red
eyes
but
a
laughing
face
and
approached
her
sister
ester
said
she
i
positively
afraid
that
you
are
growing
into
a
saint
and
i
know
that
i
a
sinner
i
consider
myself
mistaken
about
the
spasm
it
is
evidently
a
settled
disease
while
the
bell
tolled
for
evening
service
ester
stood
in
the
front
doorway
and
looked
doubtfully
up
and
down
the
damp
pavements
and
muddy
streets
and
felt
of
her
stiff
cheek
how
much
she
seemed
to
need
the
rest
and
help
of
god
house
and
yet
julia
little
hand
stole
softly
into
hers
we
been
talking
about
what
you
said
you
wanted
us
to
do
alfred
and
i
have
we
talked
about
it
a
good
deal
lately
most
wish
so
too
ere
ester
could
reply
other
than
by
an
eager
grasp
of
the
small
hand
douglass
came
out
his
horses
and
carriage
were
in
waiting
miss
ried
he
said
pausing
irresolutely
with
his
foot
on
the
carriage
step
and
finally
turning
back
i
am
going
to
drive
down
to
church
this
evening
as
i
have
a
call
to
make
afterward
will
you
not
ride
down
with
me
it
is
unpleasant
walking
ester
grave
face
brightened
i
so
glad
she
answered
eagerly
i
want
to
go
to
church
and
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
imprudent
on
account
of
my
tooth
alfred
and
julia
sat
right
before
them
in
church
and
ester
watched
them
with
a
prayerful
and
yet
a
sad
heart
what
right
had
she
to
expect
an
answer
to
her
petitions
when
her
life
had
been
working
against
them
all
that
day
and
yet
the
blood
of
christ
was
and
there
was
always
righteousness
to
plead
and
she
bent
her
head
in
renewed
supplications
for
these
two
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
before
they
call
i
will
answer
and
while
they
are
yet
speaking
i
will
hear
into
one
of
the
breathless
stillnesses
that
came
while
beating
hearts
were
waiting
for
the
requests
that
they
hoped
would
be
made
broke
julia
low
trembling
yet
singularly
clear
voice
please
pray
for
me
there
was
a
little
choking
in
alfred
throat
and
a
good
deal
of
shuffling
done
with
his
boots
it
was
so
much
more
of
a
struggle
for
the
sturdy
boy
than
the
gentle
little
girl
but
he
stood
manfully
on
his
feet
at
last
and
his
words
though
few
were
fraught
with
as
much
meaning
as
any
which
had
been
spoken
there
that
evening
for
they
were
distinct
and
decided
me
too
chapter
xxvii
the
time
to
sleep
life
went
swiftly
and
busily
on
with
the
close
of
december
the
blessed
daily
meetings
closed
rather
they
closed
with
the
first
week
of
the
new
year
which
the
church
kept
as
a
sort
of
jubilee
week
in
honor
of
the
glorious
things
that
had
been
done
for
them
the
new
year
opened
in
joy
for
ester
many
things
were
different
the
honest
straightforward
little
julia
carried
all
her
earnestness
of
purpose
into
this
new
life
which
had
possessed
her
soul
and
the
sturdy
brother
had
naturally
too
decided
a
nature
to
do
any
thing
so
ester
was
sure
of
this
young
sister
and
brother
besides
there
was
a
new
order
of
things
between
her
mother
and
herself
each
had
discovered
that
the
other
was
bound
on
the
same
journey
and
that
there
were
delightful
by
the
way
for
herself
she
was
slowly
but
surely
gaining
little
crosses
that
she
stooped
and
resolutely
took
up
grew
to
be
less
and
less
until
they
some
of
them
merged
into
positive
pleasures
there
were
many
things
that
cast
rays
of
joy
all
about
her
path
but
there
was
still
one
heavy
abiding
sorrow
sadie
went
giddily
and
gleefully
on
her
downward
way
if
she
perchance
seemed
to
have
a
serious
thought
at
night
it
vanished
with
the
next
morning
sunshine
and
day
by
day
ester
realized
more
fully
how
many
tares
the
enemy
had
sown
while
she
was
sleeping
sometimes
the
burden
grew
almost
too
heavy
to
be
borne
and
again
she
would
take
heart
of
grace
and
bravely
renew
her
efforts
and
her
prayers
it
was
about
this
time
that
she
began
to
recognize
a
new
feeling
she
was
not
sick
exactly
and
yet
not
quite
well
she
discovered
considerably
to
her
surprise
that
she
was
falling
into
the
habit
of
sitting
down
on
a
stair
to
rest
ere
she
had
reached
the
top
of
the
first
flight
also
that
she
was
sometimes
obliged
to
stay
her
sweeping
and
clasp
her
hands
suddenly
over
a
strange
beating
in
her
heart
but
she
laughed
at
her
mother
anxious
face
and
pronounced
herself
quite
well
quite
well
only
perhaps
a
little
tired
meantime
all
sorts
of
plans
for
usefulness
ran
riot
in
her
brain
she
could
not
go
away
on
a
mission
because
her
mission
had
come
to
her
for
a
wonder
she
realized
that
her
mother
needed
her
she
took
up
bravely
and
eagerly
so
far
as
she
could
see
it
the
work
that
lay
around
her
but
her
restless
heart
craved
more
more
she
do
something
outside
of
this
narrow
circle
for
the
master
one
evening
her
enthusiasm
which
had
been
fed
for
several
days
on
a
new
scheme
that
was
afloat
in
the
town
reached
its
hight
ester
remembered
afterward
every
little
incident
connected
with
that
evening
just
how
cozy
the
little
family
looked
with
her
for
its
only
occupant
just
how
brightly
the
coals
glowed
in
the
open
grate
just
what
a
brilliant
color
they
flashed
over
the
crimson
cushioned
rocker
which
she
had
vacated
when
she
heard
van
anden
step
in
the
hall
and
went
to
speak
to
him
she
was
engaged
in
writing
a
letter
to
abbie
full
of
eager
schemes
and
busy
bright
work
i
am
astonished
that
i
ever
thought
there
was
nothing
worth
living
for
so
she
wrote
why
life
is
half
long
enough
for
the
things
that
i
want
to
do
this
new
idea
just
fills
me
with
delight
i
am
so
eager
to
get
to
work
thus
far
when
she
heard
that
step
and
springing
up
went
with
eagerness
to
the
door
doctor
are
you
in
haste
have
you
just
five
minutes
for
me
ten
answered
the
doctor
promptly
stepping
into
the
bright
little
room
in
her
haste
not
even
waiting
to
offer
him
a
seat
ester
plunged
at
once
into
her
subject
are
you
the
chairman
of
that
committee
to
secure
teachers
for
the
evening
school
i
am
have
you
all
the
help
you
want
not
by
any
means
volunteers
for
such
a
employment
as
teaching
factory
girls
are
not
easy
to
find
well
doctor
do
you
think
would
you
be
willing
to
propose
my
name
as
one
of
the
teachers
i
should
so
like
to
be
counted
among
them
instead
of
the
prompt
thanks
which
she
expected
to
her
dismay
van
anden
face
looked
grave
and
troubled
finally
he
slowly
shook
his
head
with
a
troubled
i
do
think
i
can
ester
such
an
amazed
grieved
hurt
look
as
swept
over
ester
face
it
is
no
matter
she
said
at
last
speaking
with
an
effort
of
course
i
know
little
of
teaching
and
perhaps
could
do
no
good
but
i
thought
if
help
was
scarce
you
might
well
never
mind
and
here
the
doctor
interposed
it
is
not
that
ester
with
the
troubled
look
deepening
on
his
face
i
assure
you
we
would
be
glad
of
your
help
but
and
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
commenced
a
sudden
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
then
stopped
before
her
with
these
mysterious
words
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
ester
ester
look
now
was
one
of
annoyance
and
she
spoke
quickly
why
doctor
you
need
tell
me
nothing
i
am
not
a
child
to
have
the
truth
if
my
help
is
not
needed
that
is
sufficient
your
help
is
exactly
what
we
need
ester
but
your
health
is
not
sufficient
for
the
work
and
now
ester
laughed
why
doctor
what
an
absurd
idea
in
a
week
i
shall
be
as
well
as
ever
if
that
is
all
you
may
surely
count
me
as
one
of
your
teachers
the
doctor
smiled
faintly
and
then
asked
do
you
never
feel
any
desire
to
know
what
may
be
the
cause
of
this
strange
lassitude
which
is
creeping
over
you
and
the
sudden
flutterings
of
heart
accompanied
by
pain
and
faintness
which
take
you
unawares
ester
face
paled
a
little
but
she
asked
quietly
enough
how
do
you
know
all
this
i
am
a
physician
ester
do
you
think
it
is
kindness
to
keep
a
friend
in
ignorance
of
what
very
nearly
concerns
him
simply
to
spare
his
feelings
for
a
little
why
van
anden
you
do
not
think
you
do
not
mean
that
tell
me
you
mean
but
the
doctor
answer
was
grave
anxious
absolute
perhaps
the
silence
answered
her
perhaps
her
own
heart
told
the
secret
to
her
for
a
sudden
gray
palor
overspread
her
face
for
an
instant
the
room
darkened
and
whirled
around
her
then
she
staggered
as
if
she
would
have
fallen
then
she
reached
forward
and
caught
hold
of
the
little
red
rocker
and
sank
into
it
and
leaning
both
elbows
on
the
before
her
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
afterward
ester
called
to
mind
the
strange
whirl
of
thoughts
which
thrilled
her
brain
at
that
time
life
in
all
the
various
phases
that
she
had
thought
it
would
wear
for
her
all
the
endless
plans
that
she
had
made
all
the
things
that
she
had
meant
to
and
came
and
stared
her
in
the
face
nowhere
in
all
her
plannings
crossed
by
that
strange
creature
death
someway
she
had
never
planned
for
that
could
it
be
possible
that
he
was
to
come
for
her
so
soon
before
any
of
these
things
were
done
was
it
possible
that
she
must
leave
sadie
bright
brilliant
unsafe
sadie
and
go
away
where
she
could
work
for
her
no
more
then
like
a
picture
spread
before
her
there
came
back
that
day
in
the
cars
on
her
way
to
new
york
the
christian
stranger
who
was
not
a
stranger
now
but
her
friend
and
was
it
heaven
the
earnest
little
old
woman
with
her
thoughtful
face
and
that
strange
sentence
on
her
lips
maybe
my
coffin
will
do
it
better
than
i
can
well
maybe
coffin
could
do
it
for
sadie
oh
the
blessed
thought
plans
yes
but
perhaps
god
had
plans
too
what
mattered
hers
compared
to
if
he
would
that
she
should
do
her
earthly
work
by
lying
down
very
soon
in
the
unbroken
calm
of
the
rest
that
remaineth
what
was
that
to
her
presently
she
spoke
without
raising
her
head
are
you
very
certain
of
this
thing
doctor
and
is
it
to
come
to
me
soon
that
last
we
can
not
tell
dear
friend
you
be
with
us
years
yet
and
it
be
swift
and
sudden
i
think
it
is
worse
than
mistaken
kindness
it
is
foolish
wickedness
to
treat
a
christian
woman
like
a
little
child
i
wanted
to
tell
you
before
the
shock
would
be
dangerous
to
you
i
understand
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
more
hesitating
tone
does
douglass
agree
with
you
and
the
quick
pained
way
in
which
the
doctor
answered
showed
her
that
he
understood
douglass
will
not
himself
believe
it
then
a
long
silence
fell
between
them
the
doctor
kept
his
position
leaning
against
the
mantel
but
never
for
a
moment
allowed
his
eyes
to
turn
away
from
that
motionless
figure
before
him
only
the
loving
pitying
savior
knew
what
was
passing
in
that
young
heart
at
last
she
arose
and
came
toward
the
doctor
with
a
strange
sweetness
playing
about
her
mouth
and
a
strange
calm
in
her
voice
van
anden
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
do
be
afraid
to
leave
me
now
i
think
i
need
to
be
quite
alone
and
the
doctor
feeling
that
all
words
were
vain
and
useless
silently
bowed
and
softly
let
himself
out
of
the
room
the
first
thing
upon
which
ester
eye
alighted
when
she
turned
again
to
the
table
was
the
letter
in
which
she
had
been
writing
those
last
words
why
life
is
half
long
enough
for
the
things
that
i
want
to
do
very
quietly
she
picked
up
the
letter
and
committed
it
to
the
glowing
coals
upon
the
grate
her
mood
had
changed
by
degrees
very
quietly
and
very
gradually
as
such
bitter
things
creep
in
upon
a
family
it
grew
to
be
an
acknowledged
fact
that
ester
was
an
invalid
little
by
little
her
circle
of
duties
narrowed
one
by
one
her
various
plans
were
silently
given
up
the
dear
mother
first
and
then
sadie
and
finally
the
children
grew
into
the
habit
of
watching
her
footsteps
and
saving
her
from
the
stairs
from
the
lifting
from
every
possible
burden
once
in
a
long
while
and
then
as
the
weeks
passed
more
frequently
there
would
come
a
day
in
which
she
did
not
get
down
further
than
the
little
but
was
established
amid
pillows
on
the
couch
enjoying
poor
health
as
she
playfully
phrased
it
so
softly
and
silently
and
surely
the
shadow
crept
and
crept
until
when
june
brought
roses
and
abbie
ester
received
her
in
her
own
room
propped
up
among
the
pillows
in
her
bed
gradually
they
grew
accustomed
to
that
also
as
god
in
his
infinite
mercy
has
planned
that
human
hearts
shall
grow
used
to
the
inevitable
they
even
told
each
other
hopefully
that
the
warm
weather
was
what
depressed
her
so
much
and
as
the
summer
heat
cooled
into
autumn
she
would
grow
stronger
and
she
had
bright
days
in
which
she
really
seemed
to
grow
strong
and
which
deceived
every
body
save
van
anden
and
herself
during
one
of
those
bright
days
sadie
came
from
school
full
of
a
new
idea
and
curled
herself
in
front
of
ester
couch
to
entertain
her
with
it
hammond
last
she
said
such
a
curious
idea
as
like
him
as
possible
and
like
nobody
else
you
know
that
our
class
will
graduate
in
just
two
years
from
this
time
and
there
are
fourteen
of
us
an
even
number
which
is
lucky
for
hammond
well
we
are
each
you
think
to
write
a
letter
as
sensible
honest
and
piquant
as
we
can
make
it
historic
sentimental
poetic
or
otherwise
as
we
please
so
that
it
be
the
honest
exponent
of
our
views
then
we
are
to
make
a
grand
exchange
of
letters
among
the
class
and
the
young
lady
who
receives
my
letter
for
instance
is
to
keep
it
sealed
and
under
lock
and
key
until
graduation
day
when
it
is
to
be
read
before
scholars
faculty
and
trustees
and
my
full
name
announced
as
the
signature
and
all
the
rest
of
us
are
to
perform
in
like
manner
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
object
queried
abbie
precisely
the
point
which
oppressed
us
until
hammond
complimented
us
by
announcing
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
how
many
of
us
after
making
use
of
our
highest
skill
in
that
line
could
write
a
letter
that
after
two
years
we
should
be
willing
to
acknowledge
as
ours
ester
sat
up
flushed
and
eager
that
is
a
very
nice
idea
she
said
brightly
i
so
glad
you
told
me
of
it
sadie
i
write
you
a
letter
for
that
day
i
write
it
and
you
are
to
keep
it
sealed
until
the
evening
of
that
day
on
which
you
graduate
then
when
you
have
come
up
to
your
room
and
are
quite
alone
you
are
to
read
it
will
you
promise
sadie
but
sadie
only
laughed
merrily
and
said
you
are
growing
sentimental
ester
as
sure
is
the
world
how
can
i
make
any
such
promise
as
that
i
shall
probably
chatter
to
you
like
a
magpie
instead
of
reading
any
thing
this
young
girl
utterly
ignored
so
far
as
was
possible
the
fact
of
ester
illness
never
allowing
it
to
be
admitted
in
her
presence
that
there
were
any
fears
as
to
the
result
ester
had
ceased
trying
to
convince
her
so
now
she
only
smiled
quietly
and
repeated
her
petition
will
you
promise
sadie
oh
yes
i
promise
to
go
to
the
mountains
of
the
moon
on
foot
and
alone
across
lots
to
amuse
you
you
to
be
pitied
you
see
until
you
get
over
this
absurd
habit
of
cuddling
down
among
the
pillows
so
a
few
days
thereafter
she
received
with
much
apparent
glee
the
dainty
sealed
letter
addressed
to
herself
and
dropped
it
in
her
but
ere
she
turned
the
key
there
dropped
a
tear
or
two
on
the
shining
lid
well
as
the
long
hot
summer
days
grew
longer
and
fiercer
the
invalid
drooped
and
drooped
and
the
home
faces
grew
sadder
yet
there
still
came
from
time
to
time
those
rallying
days
wherein
sadie
confidently
pronounced
her
to
be
improving
rapidly
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
so
sweet
was
the
final
message
that
the
words
of
the
wonderful
old
poem
proved
a
siting
description
of
it
all
they
thought
her
dying
when
she
slept
and
sleeping
when
she
died
into
the
brightness
of
the
september
days
there
intruded
one
wherein
all
the
house
was
still
with
that
strange
solemn
stillness
that
comes
only
to
those
homes
where
death
has
left
a
seal
from
the
doors
floated
the
long
crape
signals
and
in
the
great
parlors
were
gathering
those
who
had
come
to
take
their
parting
look
at
the
white
quiet
face
ester
ried
aged
so
the
told
them
thus
early
had
the
story
of
her
life
been
finished
only
one
arrangement
had
ester
made
for
this
last
scene
in
her
life
drama
i
am
going
to
preach
my
own
funeral
sermon
she
had
said
pleasantly
to
abbie
one
day
i
want
every
one
to
know
what
seemed
to
me
the
most
important
thing
in
life
and
i
want
them
to
understand
that
when
i
came
just
to
the
end
of
my
life
it
stood
out
the
most
important
thing
still
for
christians
i
mean
my
sermon
is
to
be
preached
for
them
no
it
is
either
it
applies
equally
to
all
the
last
time
i
went
to
the
city
i
found
in
a
bookstore
just
the
kind
of
sermon
i
want
preached
i
bought
it
you
will
find
the
package
in
my
upper
bureau
drawer
abbie
i
leave
it
to
you
to
see
that
they
are
so
arranged
that
every
one
who
comes
to
look
at
will
be
sure
to
see
them
so
on
this
day
amid
the
wilderness
of
flowers
and
vines
and
mosses
that
had
possession
of
the
rooms
ranged
along
the
mantel
hanging
in
clusters
on
the
walls
were
beautifully
illuminated
texts
and
these
were
some
of
the
words
that
they
spoke
to
those
who
silently
gathered
in
the
parlors
and
that
knowing
the
time
that
now
it
is
high
time
to
awake
out
of
sleep
but
wilt
thou
know
o
vain
man
that
faith
without
works
is
dead
what
shall
we
do
that
we
might
work
the
works
of
god
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
thy
might
for
there
is
no
work
nor
device
nor
knowledge
nor
wisdom
in
the
grave
whither
thou
goest
i
must
work
the
work
of
him
that
sent
me
while
it
is
day
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
awake
to
righteousness
and
sin
not
awake
thou
that
sleepest
and
arise
from
the
dead
and
christ
shall
give
thee
light
redeeming
the
time
because
the
days
are
evil
let
us
not
sleep
as
do
others
but
let
us
watch
and
be
sober
chiming
in
with
the
thoughts
of
those
who
knew
by
whose
direction
the
illuminated
texts
were
hung
came
the
voice
of
the
minister
reading
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me
write
blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
yea
saith
the
spirit
that
they
may
rest
from
their
labors
and
their
works
do
follow
them
so
it
was
that
ester
ried
lying
quiet
in
her
coffin
was
reckoned
among
that
number
who
being
dead
yet
speaketh
chapter
xxviii
at
last
the
busy
exciting
triumphant
day
was
done
sadie
ried
was
no
longer
a
she
had
graduated
and
although
a
dress
of
the
softest
purest
white
had
been
substituted
for
the
blue
silk
in
which
she
had
so
long
ago
planned
to
appear
its
simple
folds
had
swept
the
platform
of
music
hall
in
as
triumphant
a
way
as
ever
she
had
planned
for
the
other
more
so
for
sadie
wildest
flights
of
fancy
had
never
made
her
valedictorian
of
her
class
yet
that
she
certainly
was
in
some
respects
it
had
been
a
merry
day
the
long
sealed
letters
had
been
opened
and
read
by
their
respective
holders
that
morning
and
the
young
ladies
had
discovered
amid
much
laughter
and
many
blushes
that
they
were
ready
to
pronounce
many
of
the
expressions
which
they
had
carefully
made
only
two
years
before
ridiculously
out
of
place
or
absurdly
sentimental
progress
said
hammond
turning
for
a
moment
to
sadie
after
he
had
watched
with
an
amused
smile
the
varying
play
of
expression
on
her
speaking
face
while
she
listened
to
the
reading
of
her
letter
you
were
not
aware
that
you
had
improved
so
much
in
two
years
now
were
you
i
was
not
aware
that
i
ever
was
such
a
simpleton
was
her
reply
she
loitered
strangely
in
the
parlors
in
the
halls
on
the
stairs
talking
aimlessly
with
any
one
who
would
stop
it
was
growing
late
ried
and
the
children
had
long
ago
departed
van
anden
had
not
yet
returned
from
his
evening
round
of
calls
every
body
in
and
about
the
house
was
quiet
ere
sadie
with
slow
reluctant
steps
finally
ascended
the
stairs
and
sought
her
room
arrived
there
she
seemed
in
no
haste
to
light
the
gas
moonlight
was
streaming
into
the
room
and
she
put
herself
down
in
front
of
one
of
the
low
windows
to
enjoy
it
but
it
gave
her
a
view
of
the
not
far
distant
cemetery
and
gleamed
on
a
marble
slab
the
lettering
of
which
she
knew
perfectly
well
was
ester
daughter
of
alfred
and
laura
ried
died
aged
asleep
in
jesus
awake
to
everlasting
life
and
that
reminded
her
as
she
had
no
need
to
be
reminded
of
a
letter
with
the
seal
unbroken
lying
in
her
a
letter
which
she
had
promised
to
read
this
evening
promised
the
one
who
wrote
it
for
her
and
over
whose
grave
the
moonlight
was
now
wrapping
its
silver
robe
sadie
felt
strangely
averse
to
reading
that
letter
in
part
she
could
imagine
its
contents
and
for
the
very
reason
that
she
was
still
halting
between
two
opinions
almost
persuaded
and
still
on
that
often
fatal
almost
side
instead
of
the
altogether
did
she
wait
and
linger
and
fritter
away
the
evening
as
best
she
could
rather
than
face
that
solemn
letter
even
when
she
turned
resolutely
from
the
window
and
lighted
the
gas
and
drew
down
the
shade
she
waited
to
put
every
thing
tidy
on
her
and
then
when
she
had
finally
turned
the
key
in
her
to
read
over
half
a
dozen
old
letters
and
bits
of
essays
and
scraps
of
poetry
ere
she
reached
down
for
that
little
white
envelope
with
her
name
traced
by
the
dear
familiar
hand
that
wrote
her
name
no
more
at
last
the
seal
was
broken
and
sadie
read
my
darling
sister
i
am
sitting
in
our
little
room
yours
and
mine
i
have
been
taking
in
the
picture
of
it
every
thing
about
it
is
dear
to
me
from
our
father
face
smiling
down
on
me
from
the
wall
to
the
little
red
rocker
in
which
he
sat
and
wrote
in
which
i
sit
now
and
in
which
you
will
doubtless
sit
when
i
have
gone
to
him
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
that
time
when
you
read
this
i
shall
have
been
gone
a
long
long
time
and
the
bitterness
of
the
parting
will
all
be
past
you
will
be
able
to
read
calmly
what
i
am
writing
i
will
tell
you
a
little
of
the
struggle
for
the
first
few
moments
after
i
knew
that
i
was
soon
to
die
my
brain
fairly
reeled
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
not
i
had
so
much
to
live
for
there
was
so
much
that
i
wanted
to
do
and
most
of
all
other
things
i
wanted
to
see
you
a
christian
i
wanted
to
live
for
that
to
work
for
it
to
undo
if
i
could
some
of
the
evil
that
i
knew
my
miserable
life
had
wrought
in
your
heart
then
suddenly
there
came
to
me
the
thought
that
perhaps
what
my
life
could
not
do
my
coffin
would
accomplish
perhaps
that
was
to
be
god
way
of
calling
you
to
himself
perhaps
he
meant
to
answer
my
pleading
in
that
way
to
let
my
grave
speak
for
me
as
my
crooked
marred
sinful
living
might
never
be
able
to
do
my
darling
then
i
was
content
it
came
to
me
so
suddenly
as
that
almost
the
certainty
that
god
meant
to
use
me
thus
and
i
love
you
so
and
i
long
so
to
see
you
come
to
him
that
i
am
more
than
willing
to
give
up
all
that
this
life
seemed
to
have
for
me
and
go
away
if
by
that
you
would
be
called
to
christ
and
sadie
dear
you
will
know
before
you
read
this
how
much
i
had
to
give
up
you
will
know
very
soon
all
that
douglass
and
i
looked
forward
to
being
to
each
other
but
i
give
it
up
give
him
up
more
than
willingly
joyfully
glad
that
my
father
will
accept
the
sacrifice
and
make
you
his
child
oh
my
darling
what
a
life
i
have
lived
before
you
i
do
not
wonder
that
looking
at
me
you
have
grown
into
the
habit
of
thinking
that
there
is
nothing
in
religion
you
have
looked
at
me
not
at
jesus
and
there
has
been
no
reflection
of
his
beauty
in
me
as
there
should
have
been
and
the
result
is
not
strange
knowing
this
i
am
the
more
thankful
that
god
will
forgive
me
and
use
me
as
a
means
to
bring
you
home
at
last
i
speak
confidently
i
am
sure
you
see
that
it
will
be
the
burden
the
fearful
burden
that
i
have
carried
about
with
me
so
long
has
gone
away
my
redeemer
and
yours
has
taken
it
from
me
i
shall
see
you
in
heaven
father
is
there
and
i
am
going
oh
fast
and
mother
will
not
be
long
behind
and
alfred
and
julia
have
started
on
the
journey
and
you
start
oh
i
know
it
we
shall
all
be
there
i
told
my
savior
i
was
willing
to
do
any
thing
so
my
awful
mockery
of
a
christian
life
that
i
wore
so
long
might
not
be
the
means
of
your
eternal
death
and
he
has
heard
my
prayer
i
do
not
know
when
it
will
be
perhaps
you
will
still
be
undecided
when
you
sit
in
our
room
and
read
these
words
oh
i
hope
i
you
will
not
waste
two
years
more
of
your
life
but
if
you
do
if
as
you
read
these
last
lines
that
i
shall
ever
write
the
question
is
unsettled
i
charge
you
by
the
memory
of
your
sister
by
the
love
you
bear
her
not
to
wait
another
not
one
oh
my
darling
let
me
beg
this
at
your
hands
take
it
as
my
dying
petition
renewed
after
two
years
of
waiting
come
to
jesus
now
that
question
settled
then
let
me
give
you
one
word
of
warning
do
not
live
as
i
have
done
my
life
has
been
a
failure
five
years
of
stupid
sleep
while
the
enemy
waked
and
worked
oh
god
forgive
me
sadie
never
let
that
be
your
record
let
me
give
you
a
motto
toward
the
mark
the
mark
is
high
do
look
away
from
or
forget
it
as
i
did
do
be
content
with
simply
sauntering
along
looking
toward
it
now
and
then
but
take
in
the
full
meaning
of
that
earnest
sentence
and
live
it
toward
the
mark
and
now
when
you
have
finished
reading
this
letter
do
this
last
thing
for
me
if
you
are
already
a
christian
get
down
on
your
knees
and
renew
your
covenant
resolve
anew
to
live
and
work
and
suffer
and
die
for
christ
if
you
are
not
a
christian
oh
i
put
my
whole
soul
into
this
last
request
i
beg
you
kneel
and
give
yourself
up
to
jesus
my
darling
until
we
meet
in
heaven
ester
ried
the
letter
dropped
from
sadie
nerveless
fingers
she
arose
softly
and
turned
down
the
gas
and
raised
the
shade
the
moonlight
still
gleamed
on
the
marble
slab
van
anden
came
with
quick
firm
tread
up
the
street
she
gave
a
little
start
as
she
recognized
the
step
and
her
thoughts
went
out
after
that
other
lonely
doctor
who
was
to
have
been
her
brother
and
then
back
to
the
long
earnest
letter
and
the
words
i
give
him
up
and
she
realized
as
only
those
can
who
know
by
experience
what
a
giving
up
that
would
be
how
much
her
sister
longed
for
her
soul
and
then
moved
by
a
strong
firm
resolve
sadie
knelt
in
the
solemn
moonlight
and
the
long
long
struggle
was
ended
father
and
sister
were
in
heaven
but
on
earth
this
night
their
prayers
were
being
answered
blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
yea
saith
the
spirit
that
they
may
rest
from
their
labors
and
their
works
do
follow
them
the
end
