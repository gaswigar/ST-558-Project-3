it
is
a
bit
unethical
and
unusual
for
editors
to
voice
their
opinion
of
their
own
wares
but
when
such
a
story
as
the
skylark
of
space
comes
along
we
just
feel
as
if
we
must
shout
from
the
housetops
that
this
is
the
greatest
interplanetarian
and
space
flying
story
that
has
appeared
this
year
indeed
it
probably
will
rank
as
one
of
the
great
space
flying
stories
for
many
years
to
come
the
story
is
chock
full
not
only
of
excellent
science
but
woven
through
it
there
is
also
that
very
rare
element
love
and
romance
this
element
in
an
interplanetarian
story
is
often
apt
to
be
foolish
but
it
does
not
seem
so
in
this
particular
know
so
little
about
forces
that
this
story
improbable
as
it
will
appear
in
spots
will
read
commonplace
years
hence
when
we
have
atomic
engines
and
when
we
have
solved
the
riddle
of
the
will
follow
the
explorations
and
strange
ventures
into
worlds
with
bated
breath
and
you
will
be
fascinated
as
we
were
with
the
strangeness
of
it
chapter
i
the
occurrence
of
the
impossible
petrified
with
astonishment
richard
seaton
stared
after
the
copper
upon
which
he
had
been
electrolyzing
his
solution
of
x
the
unknown
metal
for
as
soon
as
he
had
removed
the
beaker
the
heavy
bath
had
jumped
endwise
from
under
his
hand
as
though
it
were
alive
it
had
flown
with
terrific
speed
over
the
table
smashing
apparatus
and
bottles
of
chemicals
on
its
way
and
was
even
now
disappearing
through
the
open
window
he
seized
his
prism
binoculars
and
focused
them
upon
the
flying
vessel
a
speck
in
the
distance
through
the
glass
he
saw
that
it
did
not
fall
to
the
ground
but
continued
on
in
a
straight
line
only
its
rapidly
diminishing
size
showing
the
enormous
velocity
with
which
it
was
moving
it
grew
smaller
and
smaller
and
in
a
few
moments
disappeared
utterly
the
chemist
turned
as
though
in
a
trance
how
was
this
the
copper
bath
he
had
used
for
months
was
gone
gone
like
a
shot
with
nothing
to
make
it
go
nothing
that
is
except
an
electric
cell
and
a
few
drops
of
the
unknown
solution
he
looked
at
the
empty
space
where
it
had
stood
at
the
broken
glass
covering
his
laboratory
table
and
again
stared
out
of
the
window
he
was
aroused
from
his
stunned
inaction
by
the
entrance
of
his
colored
laboratory
helper
and
silently
motioned
him
to
clean
up
the
wreckage
what
happened
doctah
asked
the
dusky
assistant
search
me
dan
i
wish
i
knew
myself
responded
seaton
absently
lost
in
wonder
at
the
incredible
phenomenon
of
which
he
had
just
been
a
witness
ferdinand
scott
a
chemist
employed
in
the
next
room
entered
breezily
hello
dicky
thought
i
heard
a
racket
in
here
the
newcomer
remarked
then
he
saw
the
helper
busily
mopping
up
the
reeking
mass
of
chemicals
great
balls
of
fire
he
exclaimed
what
you
been
celebrating
had
an
explosion
how
what
and
why
i
can
tell
you
the
and
part
of
the
seaton
replied
thoughtfully
but
as
to
the
i
am
completely
in
the
dark
all
i
know
about
it
and
in
a
few
words
he
related
the
foregoing
incident
scott
face
showed
in
turn
interest
amazement
and
pitying
alarm
he
took
seaton
by
the
arm
dick
old
top
i
never
knew
you
to
drink
or
dope
but
this
stuff
sure
came
out
of
either
a
bottle
or
a
needle
did
you
see
a
pink
serpent
carrying
it
away
take
my
advice
old
son
if
you
want
to
stay
in
uncle
sam
service
and
lay
off
the
stuff
whatever
it
is
it
bad
enough
to
come
down
here
so
far
gone
that
you
wreck
most
of
your
apparatus
and
lose
the
rest
of
it
but
to
pull
a
yarn
like
that
is
going
too
far
the
chief
will
have
to
ask
for
your
resignation
sure
why
do
you
take
a
couple
of
days
of
your
leave
and
straighten
up
seaton
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
scott
returned
to
his
own
laboratory
shaking
his
head
sadly
seaton
with
his
mind
in
a
whirl
walked
slowly
to
his
desk
picked
up
his
blackened
and
battered
briar
pipe
and
sat
down
to
study
out
what
he
had
done
or
what
could
possibly
have
happened
to
result
in
such
an
unbelievable
infraction
of
all
the
laws
of
mechanics
and
gravitation
he
knew
that
he
was
sober
and
sane
that
the
thing
had
actually
happened
but
why
and
how
all
his
scientific
training
told
him
that
it
was
impossible
it
was
unthinkable
that
an
inert
mass
of
metal
should
fly
off
into
space
without
any
applied
force
since
it
had
actually
happened
there
must
have
been
applied
an
enormous
and
hitherto
unknown
force
what
was
that
force
the
reason
for
this
unbelievable
manifestation
of
energy
was
certainly
somewhere
in
the
solution
the
electrolytic
cell
or
the
concentrating
all
the
power
of
his
analytical
mind
upon
the
problem
deaf
and
blind
to
everything
else
as
was
his
wont
when
deeply
interested
he
sat
motionless
with
his
forgotten
pipe
clenched
between
his
teeth
hour
after
hour
he
sat
there
while
most
of
his
finished
the
day
work
and
left
the
building
and
the
room
slowly
darkened
with
the
coming
of
night
finally
he
jumped
up
crashing
his
hand
down
upon
the
desk
he
exclaimed
i
have
liberated
the
energy
of
copper
copper
and
electric
current
i
sure
a
fool
for
luck
he
continued
as
a
new
thought
struck
him
suppose
it
had
been
liberated
all
at
once
probably
blown
the
whole
world
off
its
hinges
but
it
was
it
was
given
off
slowly
and
in
a
straight
line
wonder
why
talk
about
power
infinite
believe
me
show
this
whole
bureau
of
chemistry
something
to
make
their
eyes
stick
out
tomorrow
if
they
wo
let
me
go
ahead
and
develop
it
resign
hunt
up
some
more
and
do
it
myself
that
bath
is
on
its
way
to
the
moon
right
now
and
there
no
reason
why
i
ca
follow
it
martin
such
a
fanatic
on
exploration
he
fall
all
over
himself
to
build
us
any
kind
of
a
craft
we
need
we
explore
the
whole
solar
system
great
cat
what
a
chance
a
fool
for
luck
is
right
he
came
to
himself
with
a
start
he
switched
on
the
lights
and
saw
that
it
was
ten
simultaneously
he
recalled
that
he
was
to
have
had
dinner
with
his
fianc√©e
at
her
home
their
first
dinner
since
their
engagement
cursing
himself
for
an
idiot
he
hastily
left
the
building
and
soon
his
motorcycle
was
tearing
up
connecticut
avenue
toward
his
sweetheart
home
chapter
ii
steel
becomes
interested
marc
duquesne
was
in
his
laboratory
engaged
in
a
research
upon
certain
of
the
rare
metals
particularly
in
regard
to
their
electrochemical
properties
he
was
a
striking
figure
well
over
six
feet
tall
unusually
even
for
his
height
he
was
plainly
a
man
of
enormous
physical
strength
his
thick
slightly
wavy
hair
was
black
his
eyes
only
a
trifle
lighter
in
shade
were
surmounted
by
heavy
black
eyebrows
which
grew
together
above
his
aquiline
nose
scott
strolled
into
the
room
finding
duquesne
leaning
over
a
delicate
electrical
instrument
his
forbidding
but
handsome
face
strangely
illuminated
by
the
ghastly
glare
of
his
arcs
hello
blackie
scott
began
i
thought
it
was
seaton
in
here
at
first
a
fellow
has
to
see
your
faces
to
tell
you
two
apart
speaking
of
seaton
think
that
he
quite
right
i
should
say
that
he
was
a
little
out
of
control
last
night
and
this
morning
replied
duquesne
manipulating
connections
with
his
long
muscular
fingers
i
do
think
that
he
insane
and
i
believe
that
he
dopes
probably
overwork
and
nervous
strain
he
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
i
think
he
a
plain
nut
myself
that
sure
was
a
wild
yarn
he
sprung
on
us
was
it
his
imagination
was
hitting
on
all
twelve
sure
he
seems
to
believe
it
himself
though
in
spite
of
making
a
flat
failure
of
his
demonstration
to
us
this
morning
he
saved
that
waste
solution
he
was
working
on
what
was
left
of
that
carboy
of
platinum
residues
after
he
had
recovered
all
the
values
you
know
and
got
them
to
put
it
up
at
auction
this
noon
he
resigned
from
the
bureau
and
he
and
reynolds
crane
that
millionaire
friend
of
his
bid
it
in
for
ten
cents
reynolds
crane
duquesne
concealed
a
start
of
surprise
where
does
he
come
in
on
this
oh
they
always
together
in
everything
they
been
thicker
than
damon
and
pythias
for
a
long
time
they
play
tennis
together
doubles
champions
of
the
district
you
know
and
all
kinds
of
things
wherever
you
find
one
of
them
you
usually
find
the
other
anyway
after
they
got
the
solution
crane
took
seaton
in
his
car
and
somebody
said
they
went
out
to
crane
house
probably
trying
to
humor
him
well
i
got
a
week
work
to
do
yet
today
as
scott
left
duquesne
dropped
his
work
and
went
to
his
desk
with
a
new
expression
half
of
chagrin
half
of
admiration
on
his
face
picking
up
his
telephone
he
called
a
number
brookings
he
asked
cautiously
this
is
duquesne
i
must
see
you
immediately
there
something
big
started
that
may
as
well
belong
to
us
no
ca
say
anything
over
the
telephone
yes
i
be
right
out
he
left
the
laboratory
and
soon
was
in
the
private
office
of
the
head
of
the
washington
or
diplomatic
branch
as
it
was
known
in
certain
circles
of
the
great
world
steel
corporation
offices
and
laboratories
were
maintained
in
the
city
ostensibly
for
research
work
but
in
reality
to
be
near
the
center
of
political
activity
how
do
you
do
doctor
duquesne
brookings
said
as
he
seated
his
visitor
you
seem
excited
not
excited
but
in
a
hurry
duquesne
replied
the
biggest
thing
in
history
has
just
broken
and
we
got
to
work
fast
if
we
get
in
on
it
have
you
any
doubts
that
i
always
know
what
i
am
talking
about
no
answered
the
other
in
surprise
not
the
slightest
you
are
widely
known
as
an
able
man
in
fact
you
have
helped
this
company
several
times
in
various
deal
er
in
various
ways
say
it
brookings
is
the
right
word
this
one
is
going
to
be
the
biggest
ever
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
it
should
be
easy
one
simple
burglary
and
an
equally
simple
killing
and
wo
mean
wholesale
murder
as
did
that
oh
no
doctor
not
murder
unavoidable
accidents
why
not
call
things
by
their
right
names
and
save
breath
as
long
as
we
alone
i
not
squeamish
but
to
get
down
to
business
you
know
seaton
of
our
division
of
course
he
has
been
recovering
the
various
rare
metals
from
all
the
residues
that
have
accumulated
in
the
bureau
for
years
after
separating
out
all
the
known
metals
he
had
something
left
and
thought
it
was
a
new
element
a
metal
in
one
of
his
attempts
to
get
it
into
the
metallic
state
a
little
of
its
solution
fizzed
out
and
over
a
copper
steam
bath
or
tank
which
instantly
flew
out
of
the
window
like
a
bullet
it
went
clear
out
of
sight
out
of
range
of
his
binoculars
just
that
quick
he
snapped
his
fingers
under
nose
now
that
discovery
means
such
power
as
the
world
never
dreamed
of
in
fact
if
seaton
had
had
all
the
luck
in
the
world
right
with
him
yesterday
he
would
have
blown
half
of
north
america
off
the
map
chemists
have
known
for
years
that
all
matter
contains
enormous
stores
of
energy
but
have
always
considered
it
that
is
incapable
of
liberation
seaton
has
liberated
it
and
that
means
that
with
the
process
worked
out
the
corporation
could
furnish
power
to
the
entire
world
at
very
little
expense
a
look
of
scornful
unbelief
passed
over
brookings
face
sneer
if
you
like
duquesne
continued
evenly
your
ignorance
change
the
fact
in
any
particular
do
you
know
what
energy
is
i
afraid
that
i
do
exactly
well
it
the
force
that
exists
between
the
ultimate
component
parts
of
matter
if
you
can
understand
that
a
child
ought
to
call
in
your
chief
chemist
and
ask
him
what
would
happen
if
somebody
would
liberate
the
energy
of
one
hundred
pounds
of
copper
pardon
me
doctor
i
did
presume
to
doubt
you
i
will
call
him
in
he
telephoned
a
request
and
soon
a
man
in
white
appeared
in
response
to
the
question
he
thought
for
a
moment
then
smiled
slowly
if
it
were
done
instantaneously
it
would
probably
blow
the
entire
world
into
a
vapor
and
might
force
it
clear
out
of
its
orbit
if
it
could
be
controlled
it
would
furnish
millions
of
horsepower
for
a
long
time
but
it
ca
be
done
the
energy
is
bound
its
liberation
is
an
impossibility
in
the
same
class
with
perpetual
motion
is
that
all
mr
brookings
as
the
chemist
left
brookings
turned
again
to
his
visitor
with
an
apologetic
air
i
do
know
anything
about
these
things
myself
but
chambers
also
an
able
man
says
that
it
is
impossible
as
far
as
he
knows
he
is
right
i
should
have
said
the
same
thing
this
morning
but
i
do
know
about
these
things
they
my
business
and
i
tell
you
that
seaton
has
done
it
this
is
getting
interesting
did
you
see
it
done
no
it
was
rumored
around
the
bureau
last
night
that
seaton
was
going
insane
that
he
had
wrecked
a
lot
of
his
apparatus
and
could
explain
what
had
happened
this
morning
he
called
a
lot
of
us
into
his
laboratory
told
us
what
i
have
just
told
you
and
poured
some
of
his
solution
on
a
copper
wire
nothing
happened
and
he
acted
as
though
he
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
the
foolish
way
he
acted
and
the
apparent
impossibility
of
the
whole
thing
made
everybody
think
him
crazy
i
thought
so
until
i
learned
this
afternoon
that
reynolds
crane
is
backing
him
then
i
knew
that
he
had
told
us
just
enough
of
the
truth
to
let
him
get
away
clean
with
the
solution
but
suppose
the
man
crazy
asked
brookings
he
probably
is
a
monomaniac
really
insane
on
that
one
thing
from
studying
it
so
much
seaton
yes
he
crazy
like
a
fox
you
never
heard
of
any
insanity
in
crane
family
though
did
you
you
know
that
he
never
invests
a
cent
in
anything
more
risky
than
government
bonds
you
can
bet
your
last
dollar
that
seaton
showed
him
the
real
goods
then
as
a
look
of
conviction
appeared
upon
the
other
face
he
continued
do
you
understand
that
the
solution
was
government
property
and
he
had
to
do
something
to
make
everybody
think
it
worthless
so
that
he
could
get
title
to
it
that
faked
demonstration
that
failed
was
certainly
a
bold
stroke
so
bold
that
it
was
foolhardy
but
it
worked
it
fooled
even
me
and
i
am
not
usually
asleep
the
only
reason
he
got
away
with
it
is
that
he
has
always
been
such
an
talker
always
telling
everything
he
knew
he
certainly
played
the
fox
he
continued
with
undisguised
admiration
heretofore
he
has
never
kept
any
of
his
discoveries
secret
or
tried
to
make
any
money
out
of
them
though
some
of
them
were
worth
millions
he
published
them
as
soon
as
he
found
them
and
somebody
else
got
the
money
having
that
reputation
he
worked
it
to
make
us
think
him
a
nut
he
certainly
is
clever
i
take
off
my
hat
to
him
he
a
wonder
and
what
is
your
idea
where
do
we
come
in
you
come
in
by
getting
that
solution
away
from
seaton
and
crane
and
furnishing
the
money
to
develop
the
stuff
and
to
build
under
my
direction
such
a
as
the
world
never
saw
before
why
get
that
particular
solution
could
we
buy
up
some
platinum
wastes
and
refine
them
not
a
chance
replied
the
scientist
we
have
refined
platinum
residues
for
years
and
never
found
anything
like
that
before
it
is
my
idea
that
the
stuff
whatever
it
is
was
present
in
some
particular
lot
of
platinum
in
considerable
quantities
as
an
impurity
seaton
has
all
of
it
there
is
in
the
world
of
course
but
the
chance
of
finding
any
more
of
it
without
knowing
exactly
what
it
is
or
how
it
reacts
is
extremely
slight
besides
we
must
have
exclusive
control
how
could
we
make
any
money
out
of
it
if
crane
operates
a
rival
company
and
is
satisfied
with
ten
percent
profit
no
we
must
get
all
of
that
solution
seaton
and
crane
or
seaton
at
least
must
be
killed
for
if
he
is
left
alive
he
can
find
more
of
the
stuff
and
break
our
monopoly
i
want
to
borrow
your
squad
tonight
to
go
and
attend
to
it
after
a
few
moments
thought
his
face
set
and
expressionless
brookings
said
no
doctor
i
do
not
think
that
the
corporation
would
care
to
go
into
a
matter
of
this
kind
it
is
too
flagrant
a
violation
of
law
and
we
can
afford
to
buy
it
from
seaton
after
he
proves
its
worth
bah
snorted
duquesne
do
try
that
on
me
brookings
you
think
you
can
steal
it
yourself
and
develop
it
without
letting
me
in
on
it
you
ca
do
it
do
you
think
i
am
fool
enough
to
tell
you
all
about
it
with
facts
figures
and
names
if
you
could
get
away
with
it
without
me
hardly
you
can
steal
the
solution
but
that
all
you
can
do
your
chemist
or
the
expert
you
hire
will
begin
experimenting
without
lucky
start
which
i
have
already
mentioned
but
about
which
i
gone
into
any
detail
he
will
have
no
information
whatever
and
the
first
attempt
to
do
anything
with
the
stuff
will
blow
him
and
all
the
country
around
him
for
miles
into
an
impalpable
powder
you
will
lose
your
chemist
your
solution
and
all
hope
of
getting
the
process
there
are
only
two
men
in
the
united
states
or
in
the
world
for
that
matter
with
brains
enough
and
information
enough
to
work
it
out
one
is
richard
seaton
the
other
is
marc
duquesne
seaton
certainly
handle
it
for
you
money
ca
buy
him
and
crane
and
you
know
it
you
must
come
to
me
if
you
do
believe
that
now
you
will
very
shortly
after
you
try
it
alone
brookings
caught
in
his
duplicity
and
of
the
truth
of
duquesne
statements
still
temporized
you
modest
are
you
doctor
he
asked
smiling
modest
no
said
the
other
calmly
modesty
never
got
anybody
anything
but
praise
and
i
prefer
something
more
substantial
however
i
never
exaggerate
or
make
as
you
should
know
what
i
have
said
is
merely
a
statement
of
fact
also
let
me
remind
you
that
i
am
in
a
hurry
the
difficulty
of
getting
hold
of
that
solution
is
growing
greater
every
minute
and
my
price
is
getting
higher
every
second
what
is
your
price
at
the
present
second
ten
thousand
dollars
per
month
during
the
experimental
work
five
million
dollars
in
cash
upon
the
successful
operation
of
the
first
power
unit
which
shall
be
of
not
less
than
ten
thousand
horsepower
and
ten
percent
of
the
profits
oh
come
doctor
let
be
reasonable
you
ca
mean
any
such
figures
as
those
i
never
say
anything
i
do
mean
i
have
done
a
lot
of
dirty
work
with
you
people
before
and
never
got
much
of
anything
out
of
it
you
were
always
too
strong
for
me
that
is
i
could
force
you
without
exposing
my
own
crookedness
but
now
i
got
you
right
where
i
want
you
my
price
take
it
or
leave
it
if
you
do
take
it
now
the
first
two
of
those
figures
will
be
doubled
when
you
do
come
to
me
i
wo
go
to
anybody
else
though
others
would
be
glad
to
get
it
on
my
terms
because
i
have
a
reputation
to
maintain
and
you
are
the
only
ones
who
know
that
i
am
crooked
i
know
that
my
reputation
is
safe
as
long
as
i
work
with
you
because
i
know
enough
about
you
to
send
all
you
big
fellows
clear
down
to
perkins
away
for
life
i
also
know
that
that
knowledge
will
not
shorten
my
days
as
i
am
too
valuable
a
man
for
you
to
kill
as
you
did
please
doctor
do
use
such
language
why
not
interrupted
duquesne
in
his
cold
level
voice
it
all
true
what
do
a
few
lives
amount
to
as
long
as
they
not
yours
and
mine
as
i
said
i
can
trust
you
more
or
less
you
can
trust
me
because
you
know
that
i
ca
send
you
up
without
going
with
you
therefore
i
am
going
to
let
you
go
ahead
without
me
as
far
as
you
can
it
wo
be
far
do
you
want
me
to
come
in
now
or
later
i
afraid
we
ca
do
business
on
any
such
terms
as
that
said
brookings
shaking
his
head
we
can
undoubtedly
buy
the
power
rights
from
seaton
for
what
you
ask
you
do
fool
me
for
a
second
brookings
go
ahead
and
steal
the
solution
but
take
my
advice
and
give
your
chemist
only
a
little
of
it
a
very
little
of
that
stuff
will
go
a
long
way
and
you
will
want
to
have
some
left
when
you
have
to
call
me
in
make
him
experiment
with
extremely
small
quantities
i
would
suggest
that
he
work
in
the
woods
at
least
a
hundred
miles
from
his
nearest
neighbor
though
it
matters
nothing
to
me
how
many
people
you
kill
that
the
only
pointer
i
will
give
you
i
giving
it
merely
to
keep
you
from
blowing
up
the
whole
country
he
concluded
with
a
grim
smile
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
cynical
scientist
brookings
took
a
small
gold
instrument
very
like
a
watch
from
his
pocket
he
touched
a
button
and
held
the
machine
close
to
his
lips
perkins
he
said
softly
reynolds
crane
has
in
his
house
a
bottle
of
solution
yes
sir
can
you
describe
it
not
exactly
it
is
greenish
yellow
in
color
and
i
gather
that
it
is
in
a
small
bottle
as
there
is
much
of
the
stuff
in
the
world
i
know
what
it
smells
or
tastes
like
and
i
would
advise
experimenting
with
it
as
it
seems
to
be
a
violent
explosive
and
is
probably
poisonous
any
bottle
of
solution
of
that
color
kept
in
a
particularly
safe
place
would
probably
be
the
one
let
me
caution
you
that
this
is
the
biggest
thing
you
have
ever
been
in
and
must
not
any
effort
to
purchase
it
would
be
useless
however
large
a
figure
were
named
but
if
the
bottle
were
only
partly
emptied
and
filled
up
with
water
i
do
believe
anyone
would
notice
the
difference
at
least
for
some
time
do
you
probably
not
sir
next
morning
shortly
after
the
office
opened
perkins
whose
principal
characteristic
was
that
of
absolute
noiselessness
glided
smoothly
into
brookings
office
taking
a
small
bottle
about
half
full
of
a
liquid
from
his
pocket
he
furtively
placed
it
under
some
papers
upon
his
superior
desk
a
man
found
this
last
night
sir
and
thought
it
might
belong
to
you
he
said
this
was
a
little
less
than
half
of
it
but
that
you
could
have
the
rest
of
it
any
time
you
want
it
thank
you
perkins
he
was
right
it
is
ours
here
a
letter
which
just
came
handing
him
an
envelope
which
rustled
as
perkins
folded
it
into
a
small
compass
and
thrust
it
into
his
vest
pocket
good
morning
as
perkins
slid
out
brookings
spoke
into
his
telephone
and
soon
chambers
his
chief
chemist
appeared
doctor
chambers
brookings
began
showing
him
the
bottle
i
have
here
a
solution
which
in
some
way
is
capable
of
liberating
the
energy
of
matter
about
which
i
asked
you
yesterday
it
works
on
copper
i
would
like
to
have
you
work
out
the
process
for
us
if
you
will
what
about
the
man
who
discovered
the
process
asked
chambers
as
he
touched
the
bottle
gingerly
he
is
not
available
surely
what
one
chemist
can
do
others
can
you
will
not
have
to
work
alone
you
can
hire
the
biggest
men
in
the
line
to
help
you
expense
is
no
object
no
it
would
be
if
such
a
process
could
be
worked
out
let
me
see
whom
can
we
get
doctor
seaton
is
probably
the
best
man
in
the
country
for
such
a
research
but
i
do
think
that
we
can
get
him
i
tried
to
get
him
to
work
on
the
problem
but
he
refused
we
might
make
an
offer
big
enough
to
get
him
no
do
mention
it
to
him
with
a
significant
look
he
to
know
nothing
about
it
well
then
how
about
duquesne
who
was
in
here
yesterday
probably
next
to
seaton
i
took
it
up
with
him
yesterday
we
ca
get
him
his
figures
are
entirely
out
of
reason
are
there
any
other
men
in
the
country
who
know
anything
you
are
a
good
man
why
do
you
tackle
it
yourself
because
i
do
know
anything
about
that
particular
line
of
research
and
i
want
to
keep
on
living
awhile
longer
the
chemist
replied
bluntly
there
are
other
good
men
whom
i
can
get
however
van
schravendyck
of
our
own
laboratory
is
nearly
as
good
as
either
seaton
or
duquesne
he
has
done
a
lot
of
work
on
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
think
he
would
like
to
work
on
it
all
right
please
get
it
started
without
delay
give
him
about
a
quarter
of
the
solution
and
have
the
rest
put
in
the
vault
be
sure
that
his
laboratory
is
set
up
far
enough
away
from
everything
else
to
avoid
trouble
in
case
of
an
explosion
and
caution
him
not
to
work
on
too
much
copper
at
once
i
gather
that
an
ounce
or
so
will
be
plenty
the
chemist
went
back
to
his
laboratory
and
sought
his
first
assistant
van
he
began
brookings
has
been
listening
to
some
lunatic
who
claims
to
have
solved
the
mystery
of
liberating
energy
that
old
stuff
the
assistant
said
laughing
that
and
perpetual
motion
are
always
with
us
what
did
you
tell
him
i
did
get
a
chance
to
tell
him
anything
he
told
me
yesterday
you
know
he
asked
me
what
would
happen
if
it
could
be
liberated
and
i
answered
truthfully
that
lots
of
things
would
happen
and
volunteered
the
information
that
it
was
impossible
just
now
he
called
me
in
gave
me
this
bottle
of
solution
saying
that
it
contained
the
answer
to
the
puzzle
and
wanted
me
to
work
it
out
i
told
him
that
it
was
out
of
my
line
and
that
i
was
afraid
of
it
which
i
would
be
if
i
thought
there
was
anything
in
it
but
that
it
was
more
or
less
in
your
line
and
he
said
to
put
you
on
it
right
away
he
also
said
that
expense
was
no
object
to
set
up
an
independent
laboratory
a
hundred
miles
off
in
the
woods
to
be
safe
in
case
of
an
explosion
and
to
caution
you
not
to
use
too
much
copper
at
once
that
an
or
would
be
plenty
an
ounce
ten
thousand
tons
of
nitroglycerin
i
say
an
ounce
would
be
plenty
if
the
stuff
is
any
good
at
all
which
of
course
it
is
queer
is
it
how
the
old
man
would
fall
for
anything
like
that
how
did
he
explain
the
failure
of
the
discoverer
to
develop
it
himself
he
said
the
discoverer
is
not
available
answered
chambers
with
a
laugh
i
bet
he
is
available
he
back
in
elizabeth
again
by
this
time
where
he
came
from
i
suggested
that
we
get
either
seaton
or
duquesne
of
rare
metals
to
help
us
on
it
and
he
said
that
they
had
both
refused
to
touch
it
or
words
to
that
effect
if
those
two
turned
down
a
chance
to
work
on
a
thing
as
big
as
this
would
be
there
probably
is
nothing
in
this
particular
solution
that
is
worth
a
rap
but
what
brookings
says
goes
around
here
so
it
you
for
the
woods
and
take
any
chances
either
it
is
conceivable
that
something
might
happen
sure
it
might
but
it
wo
we
set
up
that
lab
near
a
good
trout
stream
and
i
have
a
large
and
juicy
vacation
i
work
on
the
stuff
a
little
too
enough
to
make
a
good
report
at
least
i
analyze
it
find
out
what
is
in
it
deposit
it
on
some
copper
shoot
an
electrolytic
current
through
it
and
make
a
lot
of
wise
motions
generally
and
have
a
darn
good
time
besides
chapter
iii
seaton
solves
the
problem
of
power
well
mart
said
seaton
briskly
now
that
the
company
engineers
is
organized
to
your
satisfaction
let
hop
to
it
i
suppose
i
better
beat
it
downtown
and
hunt
up
a
place
to
work
why
not
work
here
your
house
you
do
want
this
kind
of
experimenting
going
on
around
here
do
you
suppose
a
chunk
of
the
stuff
gets
away
from
me
and
tears
the
side
out
of
the
house
this
house
is
the
logical
place
to
work
i
already
have
a
complete
machine
shop
and
testing
laboratory
out
in
the
hangar
and
we
can
easily
fit
up
a
chemical
laboratory
for
you
up
in
the
tower
room
you
can
have
open
windows
on
four
sides
there
and
if
you
should
accidentally
take
out
the
wall
there
will
be
little
damage
done
we
will
be
alone
here
with
the
few
neighbors
so
thoroughly
accustomed
to
my
mechanical
experiments
that
they
are
no
longer
curious
fine
there
another
good
thing
too
your
man
shiro
he
been
with
you
in
so
many
tight
pinches
in
all
the
unknown
corners
of
the
world
on
your
hunting
trips
and
explorations
that
we
can
trust
him
and
probably
come
in
handy
yes
we
can
trust
him
implicitly
as
you
know
he
is
really
my
friend
instead
of
my
man
during
the
next
few
days
while
workmen
were
installing
a
complete
chemical
laboratory
in
the
tower
room
seaton
busied
himself
in
purchasing
the
equipment
necessary
for
the
peculiar
problem
before
him
his
list
was
long
and
varied
ranging
from
a
mighty
transformer
capable
of
delivering
thousands
of
kilovolts
down
to
a
potentiometer
so
sensitive
that
it
would
register
the
difference
of
potential
set
up
by
two
men
in
shaking
hands
from
daylight
until
dark
seaton
worked
in
the
laboratory
either
alone
or
superintending
and
assisting
the
men
at
work
there
every
night
when
crane
went
to
bed
he
saw
seaton
in
his
room
in
a
haze
of
smoke
poring
over
blueprints
or
surrounded
by
abstruse
works
upon
the
calculus
and
phenomena
making
interminable
calculations
less
than
two
miles
away
lived
dorothy
vaneman
who
had
promised
to
be
his
wife
he
had
seen
her
but
once
since
the
impossible
had
happened
since
his
prosaic
copper
had
taken
flight
under
his
hand
and
pointed
the
way
to
a
great
adventure
in
a
car
his
friend
was
to
build
moved
by
this
stupendous
power
which
he
must
learn
to
control
they
would
traverse
interstellar
space
visit
strange
planets
and
survey
strange
solar
systems
while
he
did
not
forget
his
sweetheart
the
thought
of
her
was
often
in
his
mind
and
the
fact
that
her
future
was
so
intimately
connected
with
his
own
gave
to
every
action
a
new
meaning
he
had
such
a
multitude
of
things
to
do
and
was
so
eager
to
get
them
all
done
at
once
that
day
after
day
went
by
and
he
could
not
find
time
to
call
upon
her
crane
remonstrated
in
vain
his
protests
against
seaton
incessant
work
had
no
effect
seaton
insisted
that
he
fix
firmly
just
a
few
more
points
before
they
eluded
him
and
stuck
doggedly
to
his
task
finally
crane
laid
his
work
aside
and
went
to
call
upon
the
girl
he
found
her
just
leaving
home
and
fell
into
step
beside
her
for
awhile
she
tried
to
rouse
herself
to
be
entertaining
or
at
least
friendly
but
the
usual
ease
with
which
she
chatted
had
deserted
her
and
her
false
gayety
did
not
deceive
the
crane
for
an
instant
soon
the
two
were
silent
as
they
walked
along
together
crane
thoughts
were
on
the
beautiful
girl
beside
him
and
on
the
splendid
young
genius
under
his
roof
so
deeply
immersed
in
his
problem
that
he
was
insensible
to
everything
else
i
have
just
left
dick
crane
said
suddenly
and
paying
no
attention
to
her
startled
glance
did
you
ever
in
your
life
see
anyone
with
his
singleness
of
purpose
with
all
his
brilliance
one
idea
at
a
time
is
all
that
he
seems
capable
of
though
that
is
probably
why
he
is
such
a
genius
he
is
working
himself
insane
has
he
told
you
about
leaving
the
bureau
no
has
he
has
it
anything
to
do
with
what
happened
that
day
at
the
laboratory
i
have
seen
him
since
the
accident
or
discovery
whichever
it
was
happened
he
came
to
see
me
at
ten
when
he
was
invited
for
dinner
oh
martin
i
had
been
angry
and
he
told
such
a
preposterous
story
i
been
wondering
since
if
i
did
dream
it
no
you
did
dream
it
no
matter
how
wild
it
sounded
he
said
it
and
it
is
all
true
i
can
not
explain
it
to
you
dick
himself
can
not
explain
it
even
to
me
but
i
can
give
you
an
idea
of
what
we
both
think
it
may
come
to
yes
do
well
he
has
discovered
something
that
makes
copper
act
mighty
queer
knocks
it
off
its
feet
so
to
speak
that
day
a
piece
went
up
and
never
did
come
down
yes
that
is
what
is
so
preposterous
just
a
moment
please
replied
the
imperturbable
crane
you
should
know
that
nothing
ordinary
can
account
for
dick
behavior
and
after
what
i
have
seen
this
last
week
i
shall
never
again
think
anything
preposterous
as
i
said
this
piece
of
copper
departed
the
window
for
scenes
unknown
as
far
as
a
pair
of
good
binoculars
could
follow
it
it
held
to
a
perfectly
straight
course
toward
those
scenes
we
intend
to
follow
it
in
some
suitable
vehicle
he
paused
looking
at
his
companion
face
but
she
did
not
speak
building
the
conveyance
is
where
i
come
in
he
continued
in
his
voice
as
you
know
i
happen
to
have
almost
as
much
money
as
dick
has
brains
and
some
day
before
the
summer
is
over
we
expect
to
go
somewhere
we
do
not
know
where
but
it
will
be
a
long
way
from
this
earth
there
was
a
silence
then
dorothy
said
helplessly
well
go
on
i
ca
understand
neither
can
i
all
i
know
is
that
dick
wants
to
build
a
heavy
steel
hull
and
he
is
going
to
put
something
inside
it
that
will
take
us
out
into
space
only
occasionally
do
i
see
a
little
light
as
he
tries
to
explain
the
mechanism
of
the
thing
to
me
after
enjoining
upon
her
the
strictest
secrecy
he
repeated
the
story
that
seaton
had
told
him
and
informed
her
as
to
the
present
condition
of
affairs
it
no
wonder
the
other
chemists
thought
he
was
crazy
is
it
martin
no
especially
after
the
failure
of
his
demonstration
the
next
morning
you
see
he
tried
to
prove
to
the
others
that
he
was
right
and
nothing
happened
he
has
found
out
since
that
an
electrical
machine
in
another
room
which
was
not
running
that
morning
played
a
very
important
part
when
the
copper
refused
to
act
as
it
had
the
night
before
they
all
took
the
snap
judgment
that
he
had
suffered
an
attack
of
temporary
insanity
and
that
the
solution
was
worthless
they
called
him
holme
it
almost
fits
at
that
exclaimed
dorothy
laughing
but
if
he
thought
of
that
she
added
thoughtfully
if
he
was
brilliant
enough
to
build
up
such
a
wonderful
theory
think
out
such
a
thing
as
actually
traveling
to
the
stars
all
on
such
a
slight
foundation
of
fact
i
wonder
why
he
could
have
told
me
she
had
meant
to
utter
the
last
thought
nobody
must
know
how
being
left
out
of
it
had
hurt
her
and
she
would
have
recalled
the
words
if
she
could
crane
understood
and
answered
loyally
he
will
tell
you
all
about
it
very
soon
never
fear
his
is
the
mind
of
a
great
scientist
working
on
a
subject
of
which
but
very
few
men
have
even
an
inkling
i
am
certain
that
the
only
reason
he
thought
of
me
is
that
he
could
not
finance
the
investigation
alone
never
think
for
an
instant
that
his
absorption
implies
a
lack
of
fondness
for
you
you
are
his
anchor
his
only
hold
on
known
things
in
fact
it
was
about
this
that
i
came
to
see
you
dick
is
working
himself
at
a
rate
that
not
even
a
machine
can
stand
he
eats
hardly
anything
and
if
he
sleeps
at
all
i
have
never
caught
him
at
it
that
idea
is
driving
him
day
and
night
and
if
he
goes
on
the
way
he
is
going
it
means
a
breakdown
i
do
not
know
whether
you
can
make
him
listen
to
reason
or
not
certainly
no
one
else
can
if
you
think
you
can
do
it
that
is
to
be
your
job
and
it
will
be
the
biggest
one
of
the
three
how
well
you
understand
him
dorothy
said
after
a
pause
you
make
me
feel
ashamed
martin
i
should
have
known
without
being
told
then
i
would
have
had
these
nasty
little
doubts
about
him
i
should
call
them
perfectly
natural
considering
the
circumstances
he
answered
men
with
minds
like
dick
are
rare
they
work
on
only
one
track
your
part
will
be
hard
he
will
come
to
you
bursting
with
news
and
aching
to
tell
you
all
about
his
theories
and
facts
and
calculations
and
you
must
try
to
take
his
mind
off
the
whole
thing
and
make
him
think
of
something
else
it
looks
impossible
to
me
the
smile
had
come
back
to
dorothy
face
her
head
graced
by
its
wealth
of
gleaming
auburn
hair
was
borne
proudly
and
glancing
mischief
lit
her
violet
eyes
did
you
just
tell
me
nothing
is
impossible
you
know
martin
that
i
can
make
dicky
forget
everything
even
interstellar
did
i
get
that
word
right
space
itself
with
my
violin
trying
to
beguile
a
scientist
from
his
hobby
is
comparable
only
to
luring
a
drug
addict
away
from
his
vice
but
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
you
could
do
it
he
slowly
replied
for
he
had
heard
her
play
she
and
seaton
had
been
caught
near
his
home
by
a
sudden
shower
while
on
horseback
and
had
dashed
in
for
shelter
while
the
rain
beat
outside
and
while
shiro
was
preparing
one
of
his
famous
suppers
crane
had
suggested
that
she
pass
the
time
by
playing
his
fiddle
dorothy
realized
with
the
first
sweep
of
the
bow
that
she
was
playing
a
stradivarius
the
like
of
which
she
had
played
before
only
in
her
dreams
she
forgot
her
listeners
forgot
the
time
and
the
place
and
poured
out
in
her
music
all
the
beauty
and
tenderness
of
her
nature
soft
and
full
the
tones
filled
the
room
and
in
crane
vision
there
rose
a
home
filled
with
happy
work
with
laughter
and
companionship
with
playing
children
who
turned
their
faces
to
their
mother
as
do
flowers
to
the
light
sensing
the
girl
dreams
as
the
music
filled
his
ears
he
realized
as
never
before
in
his
busy
purposeful
life
how
beautiful
a
home
with
the
right
woman
could
be
no
thought
of
love
for
dorothy
entered
his
mind
for
he
knew
that
the
love
existing
between
her
and
his
friend
was
of
the
kind
that
nothing
could
alter
but
he
felt
that
she
had
unwittingly
given
him
a
great
gift
often
thereafter
in
his
lonely
hours
he
had
imagined
that
and
nothing
less
than
its
perfection
would
ever
satisfy
him
for
a
time
they
walked
on
in
silence
on
dorothy
face
was
a
tender
look
the
reflection
of
her
happy
thoughts
and
in
crane
mind
floated
again
the
vision
of
his
ideal
home
the
home
whose
central
figure
he
was
unable
to
visualize
at
last
she
turned
and
placed
her
hand
on
his
arm
you
have
done
a
great
deal
for
me
for
us
she
said
simply
i
wish
there
were
something
i
could
do
for
you
in
return
you
have
already
done
much
more
than
that
for
me
dorothy
he
answered
more
slowly
even
than
usual
it
is
hard
for
me
to
express
just
what
it
is
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
you
and
dick
mean
much
to
me
you
are
the
first
real
woman
i
have
ever
known
and
some
day
if
life
is
good
to
me
i
hope
to
have
some
girl
as
lovely
care
for
me
dorothy
sensitive
face
flushed
warmly
so
unexpected
and
sincere
was
his
praise
that
it
made
her
feel
both
proud
and
humble
she
had
never
realized
that
this
quiet
apparently
unimaginative
man
had
seen
all
the
ideals
she
expressed
in
her
music
a
woman
expects
to
appear
lovely
to
her
lover
and
to
the
men
who
would
be
her
lovers
if
they
could
but
here
was
a
man
who
neither
sought
nor
expected
any
favors
saying
that
he
wanted
some
girl
as
lovely
for
his
own
truly
it
was
a
compliment
to
be
cherished
after
they
had
returned
to
the
house
and
crane
had
taken
his
departure
dorothy
heard
the
purr
of
a
rapidly
approaching
motorcycle
and
her
heart
leaped
as
she
went
to
the
door
to
welcome
her
lover
it
seems
like
a
month
since
i
saw
you
last
sweetheart
he
exclaimed
as
he
lifted
her
clear
from
the
floor
in
a
passionate
embrace
and
kissed
in
turn
her
lips
her
eyes
the
tip
of
her
nose
the
elusive
dimple
in
her
cheek
and
the
adorable
curve
of
her
neck
it
seems
longer
than
that
to
me
dicky
i
was
perfectly
miserable
until
martin
called
this
afternoon
and
explained
what
you
have
been
doing
yes
i
met
him
on
the
way
over
but
honestly
dottie
i
simply
get
away
i
wanted
to
the
worst
way
but
everything
went
so
slow
slow
when
you
have
a
whole
laboratory
installed
in
a
week
what
would
you
call
speed
about
two
days
and
then
there
were
a
lot
of
little
ideas
that
had
to
be
nailed
down
before
they
got
away
from
me
this
is
a
horribly
big
job
dottie
and
when
a
fellow
gets
into
it
he
ca
quit
but
you
know
that
i
love
you
just
the
same
even
though
i
do
appear
to
neglect
you
he
continued
with
fierce
intensity
i
love
you
with
everything
there
is
in
me
i
love
you
mind
body
and
spirit
love
you
as
a
man
should
love
the
one
and
only
woman
for
you
are
the
only
woman
there
never
was
and
never
will
be
another
i
love
you
morally
physically
intellectually
and
every
other
way
there
is
for
the
perfect
little
darling
that
you
are
she
moved
in
his
embrace
and
her
arms
tightened
about
his
neck
you
are
the
nearest
thing
to
absolute
perfection
that
ever
came
into
this
imperfect
world
he
continued
just
to
think
of
a
girl
of
your
sheer
beauty
your
ability
your
charm
your
perfection
being
engaged
to
a
thing
like
me
makes
me
dizzy
but
i
sure
do
love
you
little
girl
of
mine
i
will
love
you
as
long
as
we
live
and
afterward
my
soul
will
love
your
soul
throughout
eternity
you
know
that
sweetheart
girl
oh
dick
she
whispered
her
soul
shaken
with
response
to
his
love
i
never
dreamed
it
possible
for
a
woman
to
love
as
i
love
you
thou
goest
her
voice
failed
in
the
tempest
of
her
emotion
and
they
clung
together
in
silence
they
were
finally
interrupted
by
dorothy
stately
and
gracious
mother
who
came
in
to
greet
seaton
and
invite
him
to
have
dinner
with
them
i
knew
that
dot
would
forget
such
an
unimportant
matter
she
said
with
a
glint
of
dorothy
own
mischief
in
her
eyes
as
they
went
into
the
dorothy
was
amazed
to
see
the
changes
that
six
days
had
wrought
in
seaton
his
face
looked
thin
almost
haggard
fine
lines
had
made
their
appearance
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
and
around
his
mouth
and
faint
but
unmistakable
blue
rings
encircled
his
eyes
you
have
been
working
too
hard
boy
she
reproved
him
gravely
oh
no
he
rejoined
lightly
i
all
right
i
never
felt
better
why
i
could
whip
a
rattlesnake
right
now
and
give
him
the
first
bite
she
laughed
at
his
reply
but
the
look
of
concern
did
not
leave
her
face
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
at
the
table
she
turned
to
her
father
a
man
of
fifty
known
as
one
of
the
shrewdest
attorneys
in
the
city
daddy
she
demanded
what
do
you
mean
by
being
elected
director
in
the
company
and
not
telling
me
anything
about
it
daughter
he
replied
in
the
same
tone
what
do
you
mean
by
asking
such
a
question
as
that
do
you
know
that
it
is
a
lawyer
business
to
get
information
and
to
give
it
out
only
to
paying
clients
however
i
can
tell
you
all
i
know
about
the
company
without
adding
to
your
store
of
knowledge
at
all
i
was
present
at
one
meeting
gravely
voted
once
and
that
is
all
did
you
draw
up
the
articles
of
incorporation
i
am
doing
it
yes
but
they
do
mean
anything
they
merely
empower
the
company
to
do
anything
it
wants
to
the
same
as
other
large
companies
do
then
after
a
quick
but
searching
glance
at
seaton
worn
face
and
a
warning
glance
at
his
daughter
he
remarked
i
read
in
the
this
evening
that
enright
and
stanwix
will
probably
make
the
australian
davis
cup
team
and
that
the
hawaiian
with
the
unpronounceable
name
has
broken
three
or
four
more
world
records
what
do
you
think
of
our
tennis
chances
this
year
dick
dorothy
flushed
and
the
conversation
steered
by
the
lawyer
into
the
safer
channels
turned
to
tennis
swimming
and
other
sports
seaton
whose
plate
was
unobtrusively
kept
full
by
vaneman
ate
such
a
dinner
as
he
had
not
eaten
in
weeks
after
the
meal
was
over
they
all
went
into
the
spacious
where
the
men
ensconced
themselves
in
comfortable
morris
chairs
with
long
black
cigars
between
their
teeth
and
all
four
engaged
in
a
spirited
discussion
of
various
topics
of
the
day
after
a
time
the
older
couple
left
the
room
the
lawyer
going
into
his
study
to
work
as
he
always
did
in
the
evening
well
dicky
how
everything
dorothy
asked
unthinkingly
the
result
of
this
innocent
question
was
astonishing
seaton
leaped
to
his
feet
the
problem
dormant
for
two
hours
was
again
in
complete
possession
of
his
mind
rotten
he
snapped
striding
back
and
forth
and
brandishing
his
cigar
my
head
is
so
thick
that
it
takes
a
thousand
years
for
an
idea
to
filter
into
it
i
should
have
the
whole
thing
clear
by
this
time
but
i
have
there
something
some
little
factor
that
i
ca
get
i
almost
had
it
a
dozen
times
but
it
always
gets
away
from
me
i
know
that
the
force
is
there
and
i
can
liberate
it
but
i
ca
work
out
a
system
of
control
until
i
can
understand
exactly
why
it
acts
the
way
it
does
then
more
slowly
thinking
aloud
rather
than
addressing
the
girl
the
force
is
attraction
toward
all
matter
generated
by
the
vibrations
of
all
the
constituent
electrons
in
parallel
planes
it
is
directed
along
a
line
perpendicular
to
the
plane
of
vibration
at
its
center
and
approaches
infinity
as
the
angle
theta
approaches
the
limit
of
pi
divided
by
two
therefore
by
shifting
the
axis
of
rotation
or
the
plane
of
vibration
thus
making
theta
vary
between
the
limits
of
zero
and
pi
divided
by
two
he
was
interrupted
by
dorothy
who
mortified
by
her
thoughtlessness
in
getting
him
started
had
sprung
up
and
seized
him
by
the
arm
sit
down
dicky
she
implored
sit
down
you
rocking
the
boat
save
your
mathematics
for
martin
do
you
know
that
i
could
never
find
out
why
was
equal
to
or
to
anything
else
in
algebra
she
led
him
back
to
his
chair
where
he
drew
her
down
to
a
seat
on
the
arm
beside
him
whom
do
you
love
she
whispered
gayly
in
his
ear
after
a
time
she
freed
herself
i
have
practised
today
do
you
want
me
to
play
for
you
a
little
fine
business
dottie
when
you
play
a
violin
it
talks
she
took
down
her
violin
and
played
first
his
favorites
crashing
selections
from
operas
and
solos
by
the
great
masters
abounding
in
harmonies
on
two
strings
then
she
changed
to
reveries
and
soft
plaintive
melodies
seaton
listened
with
profound
enjoyment
under
the
spell
of
the
music
he
relaxed
pushed
out
the
footrest
of
the
chair
and
lay
back
at
ease
smoking
dreamily
the
cigar
finished
and
his
hands
at
rest
his
eyes
closed
of
themselves
the
music
now
a
crooning
lullaby
grew
softer
and
slower
until
his
deep
and
regular
breathing
showed
that
he
was
sound
asleep
she
stopped
playing
and
sat
watching
him
intently
her
violin
in
readiness
to
play
again
if
he
should
show
the
least
sign
of
waking
but
there
was
no
such
sign
freed
from
the
tyranny
of
the
mighty
brain
which
had
been
driving
it
so
unmercifully
his
body
was
making
up
for
many
hours
of
lost
sleep
assured
that
he
was
really
asleep
dorothy
to
her
study
and
quietly
went
in
daddy
dick
is
asleep
out
there
in
the
chair
what
shall
we
do
with
him
good
work
dottie
dimple
i
heard
you
playing
him
to
sleep
you
almost
put
me
to
sleep
as
well
i
get
a
blanket
and
we
put
him
to
bed
right
where
he
is
dear
old
dad
she
said
softly
sitting
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
rubbing
her
cheek
against
his
you
always
did
understand
did
you
i
try
to
kitten
he
answered
pulling
her
ear
seaton
is
too
good
a
man
to
see
go
to
pieces
when
it
can
be
prevented
that
is
why
i
signalled
you
to
keep
the
talk
off
the
company
and
his
work
one
of
the
best
lawyers
i
ever
knew
a
real
genius
went
to
pieces
that
same
way
he
was
on
a
big
almost
an
impossible
case
he
could
think
of
anything
else
did
eat
or
sleep
much
for
months
he
won
the
case
but
it
broke
him
but
he
was
in
love
with
a
big
beauty
of
a
girl
and
so
did
have
her
to
fiddle
him
to
sleep
well
i
go
get
the
blanket
he
concluded
with
a
sudden
change
in
his
tone
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
and
they
went
into
the
together
seaton
lay
in
exactly
the
same
position
only
the
regular
lifting
of
his
powerful
chest
showing
that
he
was
alive
i
think
we
had
better
sh
sh
interrupted
the
girl
in
an
intense
whisper
you
wake
him
up
daddy
bosh
you
could
wake
him
up
with
a
club
his
own
name
might
rouse
him
particularly
if
you
said
it
no
other
ordinary
sound
would
i
started
to
say
that
i
think
we
had
better
put
him
to
bed
on
the
davenport
he
would
be
more
comfortable
but
that
would
surely
wake
him
and
he
so
big
oh
no
it
would
unless
i
drop
him
on
the
floor
and
he
weigh
much
over
two
hundred
does
he
about
ten
or
eleven
pounds
even
though
i
am
a
lawyer
and
old
and
decrepit
i
can
still
handle
that
much
with
dorothy
anxiously
watching
the
proceeding
and
trying
to
help
vaneman
picked
seaton
up
out
of
the
chair
with
some
effort
and
carried
him
across
the
room
the
sleeping
man
muttered
as
if
in
protest
at
being
disturbed
but
made
no
other
sign
of
consciousness
the
lawyer
then
calmly
removed
seaton
shoes
and
collar
while
the
girl
arranged
pillows
under
his
head
and
tucked
the
blanket
around
him
vaneman
bent
a
quizzical
glance
upon
his
daughter
under
which
a
flaming
blush
spread
from
her
throat
to
her
hair
well
she
said
defiantly
i
going
to
anyway
my
dear
of
course
you
are
if
you
did
i
would
disown
you
as
her
father
turned
away
dorothy
knelt
beside
her
lover
and
pressed
her
lips
tightly
to
his
good
night
sweetheart
she
murmured
he
muttered
in
his
sleep
as
his
lips
responded
faintly
to
her
caress
vaneman
waited
for
his
daughter
and
when
she
appeared
the
blush
again
suffusing
her
face
he
put
his
arm
around
her
dorothy
he
said
at
the
door
of
her
room
using
her
full
name
a
very
unusual
thing
for
him
the
father
of
such
a
girl
as
you
are
hates
to
lose
her
but
i
advise
you
to
stick
to
that
boy
believe
in
him
and
trust
him
no
matter
what
happens
he
is
a
real
man
i
know
it
dad
thank
you
i
had
a
touch
of
the
blues
today
but
i
never
will
again
i
think
more
of
his
little
finger
than
i
do
of
all
the
other
men
i
ever
knew
put
together
but
how
do
you
know
him
so
well
i
know
him
of
course
but
that
different
i
have
various
ways
of
getting
information
i
know
dick
seaton
better
than
you
do
better
than
he
knows
himself
i
have
known
all
about
every
man
who
ever
looked
at
you
twice
i
have
been
afraid
once
or
twice
that
i
would
have
to
take
a
hand
but
you
saw
them
right
just
as
you
see
seaton
right
for
some
time
i
have
been
afraid
of
the
thought
of
your
marrying
the
young
men
in
your
social
set
are
such
a
hopeless
lot
but
i
am
not
any
more
when
i
hand
my
little
girl
over
to
her
husband
next
october
i
can
be
really
happy
with
you
instead
of
anxious
for
you
that
how
well
i
know
richard
seaton
well
good
night
daughter
mine
good
night
daddy
dear
she
replied
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
i
have
the
finest
dad
a
girl
ever
had
and
the
finest
boy
good
night
it
was
three
the
following
afternoon
when
seaton
appeared
in
the
laboratory
his
long
rest
had
removed
all
the
signs
of
overwork
and
he
was
his
alert
vigorous
self
but
when
crane
saw
him
and
called
out
a
cheery
greeting
he
returned
it
with
a
sheepish
smile
do
say
anything
martin
i
thinking
it
all
and
then
some
i
made
a
regular
fool
of
myself
last
night
went
to
sleep
in
a
chair
and
slept
seventeen
hours
without
a
break
i
never
felt
so
cheap
in
my
life
you
were
worn
out
dick
and
you
know
it
that
sleep
put
you
on
your
feet
again
and
i
hope
you
will
have
sense
enough
to
take
care
of
yourself
after
this
i
warn
you
now
dick
that
if
you
start
any
more
of
that
midnight
work
i
will
simply
call
dorothy
over
here
and
have
her
take
charge
of
you
that
it
mart
rub
it
in
do
you
see
that
i
am
flat
on
my
back
with
all
four
paws
in
the
air
but
i
going
to
sleep
every
night
i
promised
dottie
to
go
to
bed
not
later
than
twelve
if
i
have
to
quit
right
in
the
middle
of
an
idea
and
i
told
her
that
i
was
coming
out
to
see
her
every
other
evening
and
every
sunday
but
here
the
dope
got
that
missing
factor
in
my
theory
got
it
while
i
was
eating
breakfast
this
afternoon
if
you
had
eaten
and
slept
regularly
here
and
kept
yourself
fit
you
would
have
seen
it
before
yes
i
guess
that
right
too
if
i
miss
a
meal
or
a
sleep
from
now
on
i
want
you
to
me
but
never
mind
that
here
the
explanation
we
doped
out
before
you
know
that
the
force
is
something
like
magnetism
and
is
generated
when
the
coil
causes
the
electrons
of
this
copper
to
vibrate
in
parallel
planes
the
knotty
point
was
what
could
be
the
effect
of
a
weak
electric
current
in
liberating
the
power
i
got
it
it
shifts
the
plane
of
vibration
of
the
electrons
it
is
impossible
to
shift
that
plane
dick
it
is
fixed
by
physical
state
just
as
speed
is
fixed
by
temperature
no
it
is
that
is
it
usually
is
but
in
this
case
it
may
be
shifted
here
the
mathematical
proof
so
saying
seaton
went
over
to
the
drafting
table
tacked
down
a
huge
sheet
of
paper
and
sketched
rapidly
explaining
as
he
drew
soon
the
two
men
were
engaged
in
a
profound
mathematical
argument
sheet
after
sheet
of
paper
was
filled
with
equations
and
calculations
and
the
table
was
covered
with
reference
books
after
two
hours
of
intense
study
and
hot
discussion
crane
face
took
on
a
look
of
dawning
comprehension
which
changed
to
amazement
and
then
to
joy
for
the
first
time
in
seaton
long
acquaintance
with
him
his
habitual
calm
was
broken
by
george
he
cried
shaking
seaton
hand
in
both
of
his
i
think
you
have
it
but
how
under
the
sun
did
you
get
the
idea
that
calculus
is
in
any
of
the
books
where
did
you
get
it
dick
you
a
wonder
i
do
know
how
i
got
the
idea
it
merely
came
to
me
but
that
math
is
right
it
to
be
right
no
other
conclusion
is
possible
now
if
that
calc
is
right
and
i
know
it
is
do
you
see
how
narrow
the
permissible
limits
of
shifting
are
look
at
equation
believe
me
i
sure
was
lucky
that
day
in
the
bureau
it
a
wonder
i
did
blow
up
the
whole
works
suppose
i
had
been
working
with
a
storage
cell
that
gave
only
four
amperes
at
two
volts
that
unusually
low
you
know
for
that
kind
of
work
crane
carefully
studied
the
equation
referred
to
and
figured
for
a
moment
in
that
case
the
limit
would
be
exactly
eight
watts
anything
above
that
means
instant
decomposition
yes
crane
whistled
a
long
low
whistle
and
that
bath
weighed
forty
pounds
enough
to
vaporize
the
whole
planet
dick
it
can
not
be
possible
it
does
seem
that
way
but
it
is
it
certainly
makes
me
turn
cold
all
over
though
to
think
of
what
might
have
happened
you
know
now
why
i
would
touch
the
solution
again
until
i
had
this
stuff
worked
out
i
certainly
do
you
should
be
even
more
afraid
of
it
now
i
do
mind
nitroglycerin
or
but
anything
like
that
is
merely
a
plaything
compared
to
this
perhaps
we
had
better
drop
it
not
in
seven
thousand
years
the
mere
fact
that
i
was
so
lucky
at
first
proves
that
fate
intended
this
thing
to
be
my
oyster
however
i
not
tempt
the
old
lady
any
farther
i
going
to
start
with
one
millionth
of
a
volt
and
will
use
a
piece
of
copper
visible
only
under
a
microscope
but
there
absolutely
no
danger
now
that
we
know
what
it
is
i
can
make
it
eat
out
of
my
hand
look
at
this
equation
here
though
that
being
true
it
looks
as
though
you
could
get
the
same
explosive
effect
by
taking
a
piece
of
copper
which
had
once
been
partially
decomposed
and
subjecting
it
to
some
force
say
an
extremely
heavy
current
again
under
the
influence
of
the
coil
a
small
current
would
explode
it
it
it
looks
that
way
from
those
figures
say
would
that
make
some
bullet
unstabilize
a
piece
of
copper
in
that
way
and
put
it
inside
a
rifle
bullet
arranged
to
make
a
short
circuit
on
impact
by
making
the
piece
of
copper
barely
visible
you
could
have
the
explosive
effect
of
only
a
few
sticks
of
dynamite
a
piece
the
size
of
a
pea
would
obliterate
new
york
city
but
that
a
long
way
from
our
perhaps
not
so
far
as
you
think
when
we
explore
new
worlds
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
have
a
liberal
supply
of
such
ammunition
of
various
weights
for
emergencies
it
might
at
that
here
another
point
in
equation
suppose
the
unstabilized
copper
were
treated
with
a
very
weak
current
not
strong
enough
to
explode
it
a
sort
of
borderline
condition
the
energy
would
be
liberated
apparently
but
in
an
entirely
new
way
wonder
what
would
happen
i
ca
see
from
the
theory
have
to
work
it
out
and
another
somewhat
similar
condition
right
here
that
will
need
investigating
i
sure
got
a
lot
of
experimental
work
ahead
of
me
before
i
know
anything
how
things
going
with
you
i
have
the
drawings

done

all

little
things
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
then
as
soon
as
you
get
the
power
under
control
we
will
have
only
to
sketch
in
the

of

at

the
village
of
bankerville
about
thirty
miles
north
of
this
place
was
totally
destroyed
by
an
explosion
of
such
terrific
violence
that
seismographs
all
over
the
world
recorded
the
shock
and
that
windows
were
shattered
even
in
this
city
a
thick
pall
of
dust
and
smoke
was
observed
in
the
sky
and
parties
set
out
immediately
they
found
instead
of
the
little

nothing
except
an
immense
hole
in
the

some
two
miles
in

and
variously

less
than
half
an
hour
he
arrived
at
his
house
on
park
road
overlooking
beautiful
rock
creek
park
here
he
lived
alone
save
for
an
old
colored
couple
who
were
his
servants
in
the
busiest
part
of
the
afternoon
chambers
rushed
unannounced
into
brookings
private
office
his
face
was
white
as
chalk
read
that
mr
brookings
he
gasped
thrusting
the
extra
into
his
hand
brookings
read
the
news
of
the
explosion
then
looked
at
his
chief
chemist
his
face
turning
gray
yes
sir
that
was
our
laboratory
said
chambers
dully
the
fool
did
you
tell
him
to
work
with
small
quantities
i
did
he
said
not
to
worry
that
he
was
taking
no
chances
that
he
would
never
have
more
than
a
gram
of
copper
on
hand
at
once
in
the
whole
laboratory
well
i
be
damned
slowly
turning
to
the
telephone
brookings
called
a
number
and
asked
for
doctor
duquesne
then
called
another
brookings
speaking
i
would
like
to
see
you
this
afternoon
will
you
be
at
home
i
be
there
in
about
an
hour
good
bye
when
brookings
arrived
he
was
shown
into
duquesne
study
the
two
men
shook
hands
perfunctorily
and
sat
down
the
scientist
waiting
for
the
other
to
speak
well
duquesne
you
were
right
our
man
could
handle
it
but
of
course
you
did
mean
the
terms
you
mentioned
before
duquesne
lips
smiled
a
hard
cold
smile
you
know
what
i
said
brookings
those
terms
are
now
doubled
twenty
thousand
and
ten
million
nothing
else
goes
i
expected
it
since
you
never
back
down
the
corporation
expects
to
pay
for
its
mistakes
we
accept
your
terms
and
i
have
contracts
here
for
your
services
as
research
director
at
a
salary
of
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
dollars
per
annum
with
the
bonus
and
royalties
you
demand
duquesne
glanced
over
the
documents
and
thrust
them
into
his
pocket
i
go
over
these
with
my
attorney
and
mail
one
back
to
you
if
he
approves
the
contract
in
the
meantime
we
may
as
well
get
down
to
business
what
would
you
suggest
asked
brookings
you
people
stole
the
solution
i
see
do
use
such
harsh
language
doctor
it
why
not
i
for
direct
action
first
last
and
all
the
time
this
thing
is
too
important
to
permit
of
mincing
words
or
actions
it
a
waste
of
time
have
you
the
solution
here
yes
here
it
is
drawing
the
bottle
from
his
pocket
where
the
rest
of
it
asked
duquesne
as
he
noted
the
size
of
the
bottle
all
that
we
found
is
here
except
about
a
teaspoonful
which
the
expert
had
to
work
on
replied
brookings
we
did
get
it
all
only
half
of
it
the
rest
of
it
was
diluted
with
water
so
that
it
would
be
missed
after
we
get
started
if
you
find
it
works
out
satisfactorily
we
can
procure
the
rest
of
it
that
will
certainly
cause
a
disturbance
but
it
may
be
necessary
half
of
it
interrupted
duquesne
you
have
of
it
here
when
i
saw
it
in
the
bureau
seaton
had
about
five
hundred
milliliters
over
a
pint
of
it
i
wonder
if
you
me
again
no
you
not
he
continued
paying
no
attention
to
the
protestations
of
innocence
you
paying
me
too
much
to
want
to
block
me
now
the
crook
you
sent
out
to
get
the
stuff
turned
in
only
this
much
do
you
suppose
he
is
holding
out
on
us
no
you
know
perkins
and
his
methods
he
missed
the
main
bottle
then
that
where
your
methods
make
me
tired
when
i
want
anything
done
i
believe
in
doing
it
myself
then
i
know
it
done
right
as
to
what
i
suggest
that
easy
i
will
take
three
or
four
of
perkins
gunmen
tonight
we
go
out
there
and
raid
the
place
we
shoot
seaton
and
anybody
else
who
gets
in
the
way
we
dynamite
the
safe
and
take
their
solution
plans
notes
money
and
anything
else
we
want
no
no
doctor
that
too
crude
altogether
if
we
have
to
do
that
let
it
be
only
as
a
last
resort
i
say
do
it
first
then
we
know
we
will
get
results
i
tell
you
afraid
of
pussyfooting
and
gumshoeing
around
seaton
and
crane
i
used
to
think
that
seaton
was
easy
but
he
seems
to
have
developed
greatly
in
the
last
few
weeks
and
crane
never
was
anybody
fool
together
they
make
a
combination
hard
to
beat
brute
force
applied
without
warning
is
our
best
bet
and
there
no
danger
you
know
that
we
got
away
clean
with
lots
worse
stuff
it
always
dangerous
and
we
could
wink
at
such
tactics
only
after
everything
else
has
failed
why
not
work
it
out
from
this
solution
we
have
and
then
quietly
get
the
rest
of
it
after
we
have
it
worked
out
seaton
might
get
into
an
accident
on
his
motorcycle
and
we
could
prove
by
the
state
of
development
of
our
plans
that
we
discovered
it
long
ago
because
developing
the
stuff
is
highly
dangerous
as
you
have
found
out
even
seaton
would
have
been
alive
now
if
he
had
had
a
lot
of
luck
at
the
start
then
too
it
would
take
too
much
time
seaton
has
already
developed
it
you
see
i
have
been
asleep
and
i
know
what
he
has
done
just
as
well
as
you
do
and
why
should
we
go
through
all
that
slow
and
dangerous
experimental
work
when
we
can
get
their
notes
and
plans
as
well
as
not
there
is
bound
to
be
trouble
anyway
when
we
steal
all
their
solution
even
though
they
have
missed
this
little
bit
of
it
yet
and
it
might
as
well
come
now
as
any
other
time
the
corporation
is
amply
protected
and
i
am
still
a
government
chemist
nobody
even
suspects
that
i
am
in
on
this
deal
i
will
never
see
you
except
after
hours
and
in
private
and
will
never
come
near
your
offices
we
will
be
so
cautious
that
even
if
anyone
should
get
suspicious
they
possibly
link
us
together
and
until
they
do
link
us
together
we
are
all
safe
no
brookings
a
raid
in
force
is
the
only
sure
and
safe
way
what
is
more
natural
than
a
burglary
of
a
rich
man
house
it
will
be
a
simple
affair
the
police
will
stir
around
for
a
few
days
then
it
will
all
be
forgotten
and
we
can
go
ahead
nobody
will
suspect
anything
except
crane
if
he
is
alive
and
he
wo
be
able
to
do
anything
so
the
argument
raged
brookings
was
convinced
that
duquesne
was
right
in
wanting
to
get
possession
of
all
the
solution
and
also
of
the
working
notes
and
plans
but
would
not
agree
to
the
means
suggested
holding
out
for
quieter
and
more
devious
but
less
actionable
methods
finally
he
ended
the
argument
with
a
flat
refusal
to
countenance
the
raid
and
the
scientist
was
forced
to
yield
although
he
declared
that
they
would
have
to
use
his
methods
in
the
end
and
that
it
would
save
time
money
and
perhaps
lives
if
they
were
used
first
brookings
then
took
from
his
pocket
his
wireless
and
called
perkins
he
told
him
of
the
larger
bottle
of
solution
instructing
him
to
secure
it
and
to
bring
back
all
plans
notes
and
other
material
he
could
find
which
in
any
way
pertained
to
the
matter
in
hand
then
after
promising
duquesne
to
keep
him
informed
of
developments
and
giving
him
an
instrument
similar
to
the
one
he
himself
carried
brookings
took
his
leave
seaton
had
worked
from
early
morning
until
late
at
night
but
had
rigorously
kept
his
promise
to
dorothy
he
had
slept
seven
or
eight
hours
every
night
and
had
called
upon
her
regularly
returning
from
the
visits
with
zest
for
his
work
late
in
the
afternoon
upon
the
day
of
the
explosion
seaton
stepped
into
crane
shop
with
a
mass
of
notes
in
his
hand
well
mart
i
got
it
some
of
it
at
least
the
power
is
just
what
we
figured
it
so
immensely
large
as
to
be
beyond
belief
i
have
found
first
that
it
is
a
practically
irresistible
along
the
axis
of
the
treated
wire
or
bar
it
is
apparently
focused
at
infinity
as
objects
are
not
affected
second
i
have
studied
two
of
the
regions
of
current
we
discussed
i
have
found
that
in
one
the
power
is
liberated
as
a
similar
attractive
force
but
is
focused
upon
the
first
object
in
line
with
the
axis
of
the
bar
as
long
as
the
current
is
applied
it
remains
focused
upon
that
object
no
matter
what
comes
between
in
the
second
condition
the
power
is
liberated
as
a
terrific
repulsion
third
that
the
copper
is
completely
transformed
into
available
energy
there
being
no
heat
whatever
liberated
fourth
most
important
of
all
that
the
x
acts
only
as
a
catalyst
for
the
copper
and
is
not
itself
consumed
so
that
an
infinitesimally
thin
coating
is
all
that
is
required
you
certainly
have
found
out
a
great
deal
about
it
replied
crane
who
had
been
listening
with
the
closest
attention
a
look
of
admiration
upon
his
face
you
have
all
the
essential
facts
right
there
now
we
can
go
ahead
and
put
in
the
details
which
will
finish
up
the
plans
completely
also
one
of
those
points
solves
my
hardest
problem
that
of
getting
back
to
the
earth
after
we
lose
sight
of
it
we
can
make
a
small
bar
in
that
condition
and
focus
it
upon
the
earth
and
we
can
use
that
repulsive
property
to
ward
off
any
meteorites
which
may
come
too
close
to
us
that
right
i
never
thought
of
using
those
points
for
anything
i
found
them
out
incidentally
and
merely
mentioned
them
as
interesting
facts
i
have
a
model
of
the
main
bar
built
though
that
will
lift
me
into
the
air
and
pull
me
all
around
want
to
see
it
work
i
certainly
do
as
they
were
going
out
to
the
landing
field
shiro
called
to
them
and
they
turned
back
to
the
house
learning
that
dorothy
and
her
father
had
just
arrived
hello
boys
dorothy
said
bestowing
her
radiant
smile
upon
them
both
as
seaton
seized
her
hand
dad
and
i
came
out
to
see
that
you
were
taking
care
of
yourselves
and
to
see
what
you
are
doing
are
visitors
allowed
no
replied
seaton
promptly
all
visitors
are
barred
members
of
the
firm
and
members
of
the
family
however
are
not
classed
as
visitors
you
came
at
the
right
time
said
crane
smiling
dick
has
just
finished
a
model
and
was
about
to
demonstrate
it
to
me
when
you
arrived
come
with
us
and
watch
the
i
object
interrupted
seaton
it
is
a
highly
undignified
performance
as
yet
and
objection
overruled
interposed
the
lawyer
decisively
you
are
too
young
and
impetuous
to
have
any
dignity
therefore
any
performance
not
undignified
would
be
impossible
the
demonstration
will
proceed
laughing
merrily
the
four
made
their
way
to
the
testing
shed
in
front
of
which
seaton
donned
a
heavy
leather
harness
buckled
about
his
shoulders
body
and
legs
to
which
were
attached
numerous
handles
switches
boxes
and
other
pieces
of
apparatus
he
snapped
the
switch
which
started
the
tesla
coil
in
the
shed
and
pressed
a
button
on
an
instrument
in
his
hand
attached
to
his
harness
by
a
small
steel
cable
instantly
there
was
a
creak
of
straining
leather
and
he
shot
vertically
into
the
air
for
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
where
he
stopped
and
remained
motionless
for
a
few
moments
then
the
watchers
saw
him
point
his
arm
and
dart
in
the
direction
in
which
he
pointed
by
merely
pointing
apparently
he
changed
his
direction
at
will
going
up
and
down
forward
and
backward
describing
circles
and
loops
and
figures
of
eight
after
a
few
minutes
of
this
display
he
descended
slowing
up
abruptly
as
he
neared
the
ground
and
making
an
easy
landing
there
oh
beauteous
lady
and
esteemed
sirs
he
began
with
a
low
bow
and
a
sweeping
flourish
when
there
was
a
snap
and
he
was
jerked
sidewise
off
his
feet
in
bowing
his
cumbersome
harness
had
pressed
the
controlling
switch
and
the
instrument
he
held
in
his
hand
which
contained
the
or
bar
had
torn
itself
loose
from
its
buckle
instead
of
being
within
easy
reach
of
his
hand
it
was
over
six
feet
away
and
was
dragging
him
helplessly
after
it
straight
toward
the
high
stone
wall
but
only
momentarily
was
he
helpless
his
keen
mind
discovering
a
way
out
of
the
predicament
even
as
he
managed
to
scramble
to
his
feet
in
spite
of
the
rapid
pace
throwing
his
body
sidewise
and
reaching
out
his
long
arm
as
far
as
possible
toward
the
bar
he
succeeded
in
swinging
it
around
so
that
he
was
running
back
toward
the
party
and
the
spacious
landing
field
dorothy
and
her
father
were
standing
motionless
staring
at
seaton
the
former
with
terror
in
her
eyes
the
latter
in
blank
amazement
crane
had
darted
to
the
switch
controlling
the
coil
and
was
reaching
for
it
when
seaton
passed
them
do
touch
that
switch
he
yelled
i
catch
that
thing
yet
at
this
evidence
that
seaton
still
thought
himself
master
of
the
situation
crane
began
to
laugh
though
he
still
kept
his
hand
near
the
controlling
switch
dorothy
relieved
of
her
fear
for
her
safety
could
not
help
but
join
him
so
ludicrous
were
seaton
antics
the
bar
was
straight
out
in
front
of
him
about
five
feet
above
the
ground
going
somewhat
faster
than
a
man
could
run
it
turned
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
as
his
weight
was
thrown
to
one
side
or
the
other
seaton
dragged
along
like
a
small
boy
trying
to
hold
a
runaway
calf
by
the
tail
was
covering
the
ground
in
prodigious
leaps
and
bounds
at
the
same
time
pulling
himself
up
hand
over
hand
to
the
bar
in
front
of
him
he
soon
reached
it
seized
it
in
both
hands
again
darted
into
the
air
and
descended
lightly
near
the
others
who
were
rocking
with
laughter
i
said
it
would
be
undignified
chuckled
seaton
rather
short
of
breath
but
i
did
know
just
how
much
so
it
was
going
to
be
dorothy
tucked
her
fingers
into
his
hand
are
you
hurt
anywhere
dick
not
a
bit
he
led
me
a
great
chase
though
i
was
scared
to
death
until
you
told
martin
to
let
the
switch
alone
but
it
was
funny
then
i
had
noticed
your
resemblance
to
a
before
wo
you
do
it
again
sometime
and
let
us
take
a
movie
of
it
that
was
as
good
as
any
show
in
town
dick
said
the
lawyer
wiping
his
eyes
but
you
must
be
more
careful
next
time
it
might
not
be
funny
at
all
there
will
be
no
next
time
for
this
rig
replied
seaton
this
is
merely
to
show
us
that
our
ideas
are
all
right
the
next
trip
will
be
in
a
boat
it
was
perfectly
wonderful
declared
dorothy
i
know
this
first
flight
of
yours
will
be
a
or
something
in
history
i
pretend
to
understand
how
you
did
it
the
sight
of
you
standing
still
up
there
in
the
air
made
me
wonder
if
i
really
were
awake
even
though
i
knew
what
to
expect
but
we
would
have
missed
it
for
worlds
would
we
dad
no
i
am
very
glad
that
we
saw
the
first
demonstration
the
world
has
never
before
seen
anything
like
it
and
you
two
men
will
rank
as
two
of
the
greatest
discoverers
seaton
will
you
mean
replied
crane
uncomfortably
you
know
i
did
have
anything
to
do
with
it
it
nearly
all
yours
denied
seaton
without
your
ideas
i
would
have
lost
myself
in
space
in
my
first
attempt
you
are
both
wrong
said
vaneman
you
martin
have
enough
imagination
and
you
dick
have
altogether
too
much
for
either
of
you
to
have
done
this
alone
the
honor
will
be
divided
equally
between
you
he
turned
to
crane
as
dorothy
and
seaton
set
out
toward
the
house
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
commercially
dick
of
course
thought
of
anything
except
this
equally
of
course
you
have
yes
knowing
the
general
nature
of
the
power
and
confident
that
dick
would
control
it
i
have
already
drawn
up
sketches
for
a
installation
of
five
hundred
thousand
electrical
horsepower
which
will
enable
us
to
sell
power
for
less
than
of
a
cent
per
and
still
return
twenty
percent
annual
dividends
however
the
comes
after
the
flyer
why
why
not
build
the
first
and
take
the
pleasure
trip
afterward
there
are
several
reasons
the
principal
one
is
that
dick
and
i
would
rather
be
off
exploring
new
worlds
while
the
other
members
of
the
company
engineers
build
the
during
the
talk
the
men
had
reached
the
house
into
which
the
others
had
disappeared
some
time
before
upon
crane
invitation
vaneman
and
his
daughter
stayed
to
dinner
and
dorothy
played
for
awhile
upon
wonderful
violin
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
animated
discussion
of
the
realization
of
seaton
dreams
of
flying
without
wings
and
beyond
the
supporting
atmosphere
seaton
and
crane
did
their
best
to
explain
to
the
visitors
how
such
flight
was
possible
well
i
am
beginning
to
understand
it
a
little
said
dorothy
finally
in
plain
language
it
is
like
a
big
magnet
or
something
but
different
is
that
it
that
it
exactly
seaton
assured
her
what
are
you
going
to
call
it
it
is
like
anything
else
that
ever
was
already
this
evening
you
have
called
it
a
bus
a
boat
a
kite
a
a
wagon
an
aerial
flivver
a
a
wampus
and
i
do
know
what
else
even
martin
has
called
it
a
vehicle
a
ship
a
bird
and
a
shell
what
is
its
real
name
i
do
know
it
has
got
any
that
i
know
of
what
would
you
suggest
dottie
i
do
know
what
general
name
should
be
applied
to
them
but
for
this
one
there
is
only
one
possible
name
skylark
exactly
right
dorothy
said
crane
fine
cried
seaton
and
you
shall
christen
it
dottie
with
a
big
florence
flask
full
of
absolute
vacuum
christen
you
the
skylark
bang
as
the
guests
were
leaving
at
a
late
hour
vaneman
said
oh
yes
i
bought
an
extra
as
we
came
out
it
tells
a
wild
tale
of
an
explosion
so
violent
that
science
can
not
explain
it
i
suppose
it
is
true
but
it
may
make
interesting
reading
for
you
two
scientific
sharps
good
night
seaton
accompanied
dorothy
to
the
car
bidding
her
a
more
intimate
farewell
on
the
way
when
he
returned
crane
with
an
unusual
expression
of
concern
on
his
face
handed
him
the
paper
without
a
word
what
up
old
man
something
in
it
he
asked
as
he
took
the
paper
he
fell
silent
as
he
read
the
first
words
and
after
he
had
read
the
entire
article
he
said
slowly
true
beyond
a
doubt
even
a
reporter
could
imagine
that
it
all
energy
all
right
some
poor
devil
trying
our
stunt
without
my
horseshoe
in
his
pocket
think
dick
something
is
wrong
somewhere
you
know
that
two
people
did
not
discover
x
at
the
same
time
the
answer
is
that
somebody
stole
your
idea
but
the
idea
is
worthless
without
the
x
you
say
that
the
stuff
is
extremely
rare
where
did
they
get
it
that
right
mart
i
never
thought
of
that
the
stuff
extremely
rare
i
am
supposed
to
know
something
about
rare
metals
and
i
never
heard
of
it
before
there
is
even
a
gap
in
the
periodic
system
in
which
it
belongs
i
would
bet
a
hat
that
we
have
every
milligram
known
to
the
world
at
present
well
then
said
the
practical
crane
we
had
better
see
whether
or
not
we
have
all
we
started
with
asking
shiro
to
bring
the
large
bottle
from
the
vault
he
opened
the
safe
and
brought
forth
the
small
vial
the
large
bottle
was
still
nearly
full
the
seal
upon
it
unbroken
the
vial
was
apparently
exactly
as
seaton
had
left
it
after
he
had
made
his
bars
our
stuff
seems
to
be
all
there
said
crane
it
looks
as
though
someone
else
has
discovered
it
also
i
do
believe
it
said
seaton
their
positions
now
reversed
altogether
too
rare
he
scanned
both
bottles
narrowly
i
can
tell
by
taking
the
densities
he
added
and
ran
up
to
the
laboratory
returning
with
a
westphal
balance
in
his
hand
after
testing
both
solutions
he
said
slowly
well
the
mystery
is
solved
the
large
bottle
has
a
specific
gravity
of
as
it
had
when
i
prepared
it
that
in
the
vial
reads
only
somebody
has
burglarized
this
safe
and
taken
almost
half
of
the
solution
filling
the
vial
up
with
colored
water
the
stuff
is
so
strong
that
i
probably
never
would
have
noticed
the
difference
but
who
could
it
have
been
search
me
but
it
nothing
to
worry
about
now
anyway
because
whoever
it
was
is
gone
where
he
never
do
it
again
he
taken
the
solution
with
him
too
so
that
nobody
else
can
get
it
i
wish
i
were
sure
of
that
dick
the
man
who
tried
to
do
the
research
work
is
undoubtedly
gone
but
who
is
back
of
him
nobody
probably
who
would
want
to
be
to
borrow
your
own
phrase
dick
scott
it
when
he
called
you
holme
for
a
man
with
your
brains
you
have
the
least
sense
of
anybody
i
know
you
know
that
this
thing
is
worth
as
a
power
project
alone
thousands
of
millions
of
dollars
and
that
there
are
dozens
of
big
concerns
who
would
cheerfully
put
us
both
out
of
the
way
for
a
thousandth
of
that
amount
the
question
is
not
to
find
one
concern
who
might
be
backing
a
thing
like
that
but
to
pick
out
the
one
who
is
backing
it
after
thinking
deeply
for
a
few
moments
he
went
on
the
idea
was
taken
from
your
demonstration
in
the
bureau
either
by
an
or
by
someone
who
heard
about
it
afterward
probably
the
former
even
though
it
failed
one
man
saw
the
possibilities
who
was
that
man
who
was
there
oh
a
lot
of
the
fellows
were
there
scott
smith
penfield
duquesne
roberts
quite
a
bunch
of
them
let
see
scott
has
brains
enough
to
do
anything
smith
does
know
anything
about
anything
except
amines
penfield
is
a
pure
scientist
who
would
even
quote
an
authority
without
asking
permission
duquesne
is
duquesne
he
i
yes
duquesne
i
have
heard
of
him
he
the
big
black
fellow
about
your
own
size
he
has
the
brains
the
ability
and
the
inclination
has
he
not
well
i
would
want
to
say
that
i
do
know
him
very
well
and
personal
dislike
is
no
ground
at
all
for
suspicion
you
know
enough
to
warrant
investigation
is
there
anyone
else
who
might
have
reasoned
it
out
as
you
did
and
as
duquesne
possibly
could
not
that
i
remember
but
we
can
count
duquesne
out
anyway
because
he
called
me
up
this
afternoon
about
some
notes
on
gallium
so
he
is
still
in
the
bureau
besides
he
would
let
anybody
else
investigate
it
if
he
got
it
he
would
do
it
himself
and
i
do
think
he
would
have
blown
himself
up
i
never
did
like
him
very
well
personally
he
such
a
cold
inhuman
son
of
a
fish
but
you
got
to
hand
it
to
him
for
ability
he
probably
the
best
man
in
the
world
today
on
that
kind
of
thing
no
i
do
not
think
that
we
will
count
him
out
yet
he
may
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
we
will
have
him
investigated
nevertheless
and
will
guard
against
future
visitors
here
turning
to
the
telephone
he
called
the
private
number
of
a
detective
prescott
crane
speaking
sorry
to
get
you
out
of
bed
but
i
should
like
to
have
a
complete
report
upon
marc
duquesne
of
the
rare
metals
laboratory
as
soon
as
possible
every
detail
for
the
last
two
weeks
every
move
and
every
thought
if
possible
please
keep
a
good
man
on
him
until
further
notice
i
wish
you
would
send
two
or
three
guards
out
here
right
away
men
you
can
trust
and
who
will
stay
awake
thanks
good
night
chapter
v
direct
action
seaton
and
crane
spent
some
time
developing
the
crane
made
a
number
of
these
instruments
mounted
in
gymbals
so
that
the
delicate
needles
were
free
to
turn
in
any
direction
whatever
they
were
mounted
upon
jeweled
bearings
but
bearings
made
of
such
great
strength
that
seaton
protested
what
the
use
mart
you
do
expect
a
watch
to
be
treated
like
a
that
needle
weighs
less
than
half
a
gram
why
mount
it
as
though
it
weighed
twenty
pounds
to
be
safe
remember
the
acceleration
the
lark
will
be
capable
of
and
also
that
on
some
other
worlds
which
we
hope
to
visit
this
needle
will
weigh
more
than
it
does
here
that
right
mart
i
never
thought
of
that
anyway
we
ca
be
too
safe
to
suit
me
when
the
compasses
were
done
and
the
power
through
them
had
been
adjusted
to
of
a
watt
the
lowest
they
could
maintain
with
accuracy
they
focused
each
instrument
upon
one
of
a
set
of
most
carefully
weighed
glass
beads
ranging
in
size
from
a
up
to
a
large
marble
and
had
the
beads
taken
across
the
country
by
shiro
in
order
to
test
the
sensitiveness
and
accuracy
of
the
new
instruments
the
first
test
was
made
at
a
distance
of
one
hundred
miles
the
last
at
nearly
three
thousand
they
found
as
they
had
expected
that
from
the
weight
of
the
object
and
the
time
it
took
the
needle
to
come
to
rest
after
being
displaced
from
its
line
by
a
gentle
tap
of
the
finger
they
could
easily
calculate
the
distance
from
the
compass
to
the
object
this
fact
pleased
crane
immensely
as
it
gave
him
a
sure
means
of
navigation
in
space
the
only
objection
to
its
use
in
measuring
earthly
distances
was
its
extreme
delicacy
the
needle
focused
upon
the
smallest
bead
in
the
lot
at
a
distance
of
three
thousand
miles
coming
to
rest
in
little
more
than
one
second
the
question
of
navigation
solved
the
two
next
devoted
themselves
to
perfecting
the
bullet
as
seaton
called
it
from
his
notes
and
equations
seaton
calculated
the
weight
of
copper
necessary
to
exert
the
explosive
force
of
one
pound
of
and
weighed
out
on
the
most
delicate
made
various
fractions
and
multiples
of
this
amount
of
the
treated
copper
while
crane
fitted
up
the
bullets
of
cartridges
to
receive
the
charges
and
to
explode
them
on
impact
they
placed
their
blueprints
and
working
notes
in
the
safe
as
usual
taking
with
them
only
those
notes
dealing
with
the
and
the
bullet
upon
which
they
were
still
working
no
one
except
shiro
knew
that
the
original
tracings
from
which
the
had
been
made
and
their
final
classified
notes
were
always
kept
in
the
vault
they
cautioned
him
and
the
three
guards
to
keep
a
close
watch
until
they
returned
then
they
set
out
in
the
biplane
to
try
out
the
new
weapon
in
a
lonely
place
where
the
exploding
shells
could
do
no
damage
they
found
that
the
came
fully
up
to
expectations
the
smallest
charge
they
had
prepared
fired
by
crane
at
a
great
stump
a
full
hundred
yards
away
from
the
bare
knoll
that
had
afforded
them
a
tore
it
bodily
from
the
ground
and
reduced
it
to
splinters
while
the
force
of
the
explosion
made
the
two
men
stagger
she
sure
is
big
medicine
laughed
seaton
wonder
what
a
real
one
will
do
and
drawing
his
pistol
he
inserted
a
cartridge
carrying
a
much
heavier
charge
better
be
careful
with
the
big
ones
cautioned
crane
what
are
you
going
to
shoot
at
that
rock
over
there
pointing
to
a
huge
boulder
half
a
mile
away
across
the
small
valley
want
to
bet
me
a
dinner
i
ca
hit
it
no
you
forget
that
i
saw
you
win
the
pistol
trophy
of
the
district
the
pistol
cracked
and
when
the
bullet
reached
its
destination
the
great
stone
was
obliterated
in
a
vast
ball
of
flame
after
a
moment
there
was
a
deafening
report
a
crash
as
though
the
world
were
falling
to
pieces
both
men
were
hurled
violently
backward
stumbling
and
falling
flat
picking
themselves
up
they
looked
across
the
valley
at
the
place
where
the
boulder
had
stood
to
see
only
an
immense
cloud
of
dust
which
slowly
blew
away
revealing
a
huge
hole
in
the
ground
they
were
silent
a
moment
awed
by
the
frightful
power
they
had
loosed
well
mart
seaton
broke
the
silence
i
say
those
loads
are
plenty
big
enough
if
that
been
something
coming
after
us
whether
any
possible
animal
a
foreign
battleship
or
the
mythical
great
himself
it
be
a
good
indian
now
yes
no
yes
when
we
use
the
heavier
charges
we
must
use
rifles
have
you
had
enough
demonstration
or
do
you
want
to
shoot
some
more
i
had
enough
thanks
that
last
rock
i
bounced
off
of
was
no
pillow
i
tell
the
world
besides
it
looks
as
though
i
busted
a
leg
or
two
off
of
our
noble
steed
with
my
shot
and
we
may
have
to
walk
back
home
an
examination
of
the
plane
which
had
been
moved
many
feet
and
almost
overturned
by
the
force
of
the
explosion
revealed
no
damage
that
they
could
not
repair
on
the
spot
and
dusk
saw
them
speeding
through
the
air
toward
the
distant
city
in
response
to
a
summons
from
his
chief
perkins
silently
appeared
in
brookings
office
without
his
usual
complacent
smile
have
you
done
anything
yet
after
all
this
time
demanded
the
magnate
we
getting
tired
of
this
delay
i
ca
help
it
brookings
replied
the
subordinate
they
got
detectives
from
prescott
all
over
the
place
our
best
men
have
been
trying
ever
since
the
day
of
the
explosion
but
ca
do
a
thing
without
resorting
to
violence
i
went
out
there
myself
and
looked
them
over
without
being
seen
there
is
a
man
there
with
a
record
and
i
been
able
so
far
to
get
anything
on
any
one
of
them
that
we
can
use
as
a
handle
no
prescott
men
are
hard
to
do
anything
with
but
ca
you
brookings
paused
significantly
i
was
coming
to
that
i
thought
one
of
them
might
be
seen
and
i
talked
to
him
a
little
over
the
phone
but
i
could
talk
loud
enough
without
consulting
you
i
mentioned
ten
but
he
held
out
for
said
he
would
consider
it
at
all
but
he
wants
to
quit
prescott
and
go
into
business
for
himself
go
ahead
on
we
want
to
get
action
said
brookings
as
he
wrote
an
order
on
the
cashier
for
thousand
dollars
in
bills
that
is
cheap
enough
considering
what
duquesne
rough
stuff
would
probably
cost
report
tomorrow
about
four
over
our
private
phone
no
i
come
down
to
the
caf√©
it
safer
the
place
referred
to
was
the
perkins
caf√©
a
restaurant
on
pennsylvania
avenue
heavily
patronized
by
the
diplomatic
political
financial
and
sporting
circles
of
washington
it
was
famous
for
its
discreet
waiters
and
for
the
absolutely
private
rooms
many
of
its
patrons
knew
of
its
unique
telephone
service
in
which
each
call
went
through
such
a
devious
system
of
relays
that
any
attempt
to
trace
it
was
hopeless
they
knew
that
while
the
perkins
would
not
knowingly
lend
itself
to
any
violation
of
law
it
was
an
entirely
safe
and
thoroughly
satisfactory
place
in
which
to
conduct
business
of
the
most
secret
and
confidential
character
a
place
from
which
one
could
enjoy
personal
conversation
with
persons
to
whom
he
wished
to
remain
invisible
and
untraceable
a
place
which
had
never
been
known
to
leak
for
these
reasons
it
was
really
the
diplomatic
and
political
center
of
the
country
and
over
its
secret
wires
had
gone
in
guarded
language
messages
that
would
have
rocked
the
world
had
they
gone
astray
it
was
recognized
that
the
place
was
occasionally
by
its
very
nature
used
for
illegal
purposes
but
it
was
such
a
political
financial
and
diplomatic
necessity
that
it
carried
a
hands
off
sign
it
was
never
investigated
by
congress
and
never
raided
by
the
police
hundreds
of
telephone
calls
were
handled
daily
a
man
would
come
in
order
something
served
in
a
private
room
leave
a
name
at
the
desk
and
say
that
he
was
expecting
a
call
there
the
affair
ended
the
telephone
operators
were
men
of
very
short
memories
carefully
trained
never
to
look
at
a
face
and
never
to
remember
a
name
or
a
number
although
the
precaution
was
unnecessary
this
shortness
of
memory
was
often
encouraged
by
bills
of
various
denominations
no
one
except
perkins
and
the
heads
of
the
great
world
steel
corporation
knew
that
the
urbane
and
polished
proprietor
of
the
caf√©
was
a
criminal
of
the
blackest
kind
whose
liberty
and
life
itself
were
dependent
upon
the
will
of
the
corporation
or
that
the
restaurant
was
especially
planned
and
maintained
as
a
blind
for
its
underground
activities
or
that
perkins
was
holding
a
position
which
suited
him
exactly
and
which
he
would
not
have
given
up
for
wealth
or
glory
that
of
being
the
guiding
genius
who
planned
nefarious
things
for
the
men
higher
up
and
saw
to
it
that
they
were
carried
out
by
the
men
lower
down
he
was
in
constant
personal
touch
with
his
superiors
but
in
order
to
avoid
any
chance
of
betrayal
he
never
saw
his
subordinates
personally
not
only
were
they
entirely
ignorant
of
his
identity
but
all
possible
means
of
their
tracing
him
had
been
foreseen
and
guarded
against
he
called
them
on
the
telephone
but
they
never
called
him
the
only
possible
way
in
which
any
of
his
subordinates
could
get
in
touch
with
him
was
by
means
of
the
wonderful
wireless
telephone
already
referred
to
developed
by
a
genius
who
had
died
shortly
after
it
was
perfected
it
was
a
tiny
instrument
no
larger
than
a
watch
but
of
practically
unlimited
range
the
controlling
central
station
of
the
few
instruments
in
existence
from
which
any
instrument
could
be
cut
out
changed
in
tune
or
totally
destroyed
at
will
was
in
perkins
office
safe
a
man
intrusted
with
an
unusually
important
job
would
receive
from
an
unknown
source
an
instrument
with
directions
sufficient
for
its
use
as
soon
as
the
job
was
done
he
would
find
upon
again
attempting
to
use
the
telephone
that
its
interior
was
so
hopelessly
wrecked
that
not
even
the
most
skilled
artisan
could
reproduce
what
it
had
once
been
at
four
brookings
was
ushered
into
the
private
office
of
the
master
criminal
who
was
plainly
ill
at
ease
i
got
to
report
another
failure
brookings
it
nobody
fault
just
one
of
those
things
that
could
be
helped
i
handled
this
myself
our
man
left
the
door
unlocked
and
kept
the
others
busy
in
another
room
i
had
just
started
to
work
when
crane
japanese
servant
who
was
supposed
to
be
asleep
appeared
upon
the
scene
if
i
had
known
something
about
myself
he
have
broken
my
neck
as
it
was
i
barely
got
away
with
the
jap
and
all
three
guards
close
behind
me
i
not
interested
in
excuses
broke
in
the
magnate
angrily
have
to
turn
it
over
to
duquesne
after
all
unless
you
get
something
done
and
get
it
done
quick
ca
you
get
to
that
jap
some
way
certainly
i
can
i
never
yet
saw
the
man
who
could
be
reached
one
way
or
another
i
had
humphreys
the
best
fixer
in
the
business
working
on
him
all
day
and
he
be
neutral
before
night
if
the
long
green
wo
quiet
him
and
i
never
saw
a
jap
refuse
it
yet
a
lead
pipe
will
silk
has
reported
yet
but
i
expect
to
hear
from
him
any
minute
now
through
our
man
out
there
as
he
spoke
the
almost
inaudible
buzzer
in
his
pocket
gave
a
signal
there
he
is
now
said
perkins
as
he
took
out
his
wireless
instrument
you
might
listen
in
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
brookings
took
out
his
own
telephone
and
held
it
to
his
ear
hello
perkins
spoke
gruffly
into
the
tiny
transmitter
what
you
got
on
your
chest
your
foot
slipped
on
the
jap
the
stranger
replied
he
crabbed
the
game
right
slats
and
the
big
fellow
put
all
the
stuff
into
the
box
told
us
to
watch
it
until
they
get
back
tonight
they
may
be
late
then
went
off
in
slats
ship
to
test
something
could
find
out
what
silk
tackled
the
yellow
boy
and
went
up
to
fifty
grand
but
the
jap
see
him
at
all
silk
started
to
argue
and
the
jap
did
do
a
thing
but
lay
him
out
cold
this
afternoon
while
the
jap
was
out
in
the
grounds
three
men
jumped
him
he
bumped
one
of
them
off
with
his
hands
and
the
others
with
his
gat
one
of
those
big
automatics
that
throw
a
slug
like
a
cannon
none
of
us
knew
he
had
it
that
all
except
that
i
am
quitting
prescott
right
now
anything
else
i
can
do
for
you
whoever
you
are
no
your
job
done
the
conversation
closed
perkins
pressed
the
switch
which
reduced
the
interior
of
the
spy
wireless
instrument
to
a
fused
mass
of
metal
and
brookings
called
duquesne
on
the
telephone
i
would
like
to
talk
to
you
he
said
shall
i
come
there
or
would
you
rather
come
to
my
office
i
come
there
they
watching
this
house
they
have
one
man
in
front
and
one
in
back
a
couple
of
detectaphones
in
my
rooms
here
and
have
coupled
onto
this
telephone
do
worry
he
continued
calmly
as
the
other
made
an
exclamation
of
dismay
talk
ahead
as
loud
as
you
please
they
ca
hear
you
do
you
think
that
those
poor
ignorant
flat
feet
can
show
me
anything
about
electricity
i
shoot
a
jolt
along
their
wires
that
would
burn
their
ears
off
if
it
were
my
cue
to
act
the
innocent
and
absorbed
scientist
as
it
is
their
instruments
are
all
registering
dense
silence
i
am
deep
in
study
right
now
and
ca
be
disturbed
can
you
get
out
certainly
i
have
that
same
private
entrance
down
beside
the
house
wall
and
the
same
tunnel
i
used
before
i
see
you
in
about
fifteen
minutes
in
brookings
office
duquesne
told
of
the
constant
surveillance
over
him
they
suspect
me
on
general
principles
i
think
he
continued
they
are
apparently
trying
to
connect
me
with
somebody
i
do
think
they
suspect
you
at
all
and
they
wo
unless
they
get
some
better
methods
i
have
devices
fitted
up
to
turn
the
lights
off
and
on
raise
and
lower
the
windows
and
even
cast
shadows
at
certain
times
the
housekeeper
knows
that
when
i
go
to
my
library
after
dinner
i
have
retired
to
study
and
that
it
is
as
much
as
anyone
life
is
worth
to
disturb
me
also
i
am
well
known
to
be
firmly
fixed
in
my
habits
so
it
easy
to
fool
those
detectives
last
night
i
went
out
and
watched
them
they
hung
around
a
couple
of
hours
after
my
lights
went
out
then
walked
off
together
i
can
dodge
them
any
time
and
have
all
my
nights
free
without
their
ever
suspecting
anything
are
you
free
tonight
yes
the
are
all
set
and
as
long
as
i
get
back
before
daylight
so
they
can
see
me
get
up
and
go
to
work
it
will
be
all
right
brookings
told
him
briefly
of
the
failures
to
secure
the
solution
and
the
plans
of
the
death
of
the
three
men
sent
to
silence
shiro
and
of
all
the
other
developments
duquesne
listened
his
face
impassive
well
he
said
as
brookings
ceased
i
thought
you
would
bull
it
but
not
quite
so
badly
but
there
no
use
whining
now
i
ca
use
my
original
plan
of
attack
in
force
as
they
are
prepared
and
might
be
able
to
stand
us
off
until
the
police
could
arrive
he
thought
deeply
for
a
time
then
said
intensely
if
i
go
into
this
thing
brookings
i
am
in
absolute
command
everything
goes
as
i
say
understand
yes
it
up
to
you
now
all
right
i
think
i
got
it
can
you
get
me
a
curtiss
biplane
in
an
hour
and
a
man
about
six
feet
tall
who
weighs
about
a
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
i
want
to
drive
the
plane
myself
and
have
the
man
dressed
in
full
leathers
and
hood
in
the
passenger
seat
shot
so
full
of
chloroform
or
dope
that
he
will
be
completely
unconscious
for
at
least
two
hours
easy
we
can
get
you
any
kind
of
plane
you
want
in
an
hour
and
perkins
can
find
a
man
of
that
description
who
would
be
glad
to
have
a
dream
at
that
price
but
what
the
idea
pardon
me
i
should
have
asked
that
he
added
as
the
saturnine
chemist
shot
him
a
black
look
from
beneath
his
heavy
brows
well
within
the
hour
duquesne
drove
up
to
a
private
aviation
field
and
found
awaiting
him
a
curtiss
biplane
whose
attendant
jumped
into
an
automobile
and
sped
away
as
he
approached
he
quickly
donned
a
heavy
leather
suit
similar
to
the
one
seaton
always
wore
in
the
air
and
drew
the
hood
over
his
face
then
after
a
searching
look
at
the
lean
form
of
the
unconscious
man
in
the
other
seat
he
was
off
the
plane
climbing
swiftly
under
his
expert
hand
he
took
a
wide
circle
to
the
west
and
north
soon
shiro
and
the
two
guards
hearing
the
roar
of
an
approaching
airplane
looked
out
and
saw
what
they
supposed
to
be
crane
biplane
coming
down
with
terrific
speed
in
an
almost
vertical
as
though
the
driver
were
in
an
extremity
of
haste
flattening
out
just
in
time
to
avert
destruction
it
taxied
up
the
field
almost
to
the
house
the
watchers
saw
a
man
recognizable
as
seaton
by
his
suit
and
his
unmistakable
physique
stand
up
and
wave
both
arms
frantically
heard
him
shout
hoarsely
all
of
you
out
here
saw
him
point
to
apparently
lifeless
form
and
slump
down
in
his
seat
all
three
ran
out
to
help
the
unconscious
aviators
but
just
as
they
reached
the
machine
there
were
three
silenced
reports
and
the
three
men
fell
to
the
ground
duquesne
leaped
lightly
out
of
the
machine
and
looked
narrowly
at
the
bodies
at
his
feet
he
saw
that
the
two
detectives
were
dead
but
found
with
some
chagrin
that
the
japanese
still
showed
faint
signs
of
life
he
half
drew
his
pistol
to
finish
the
job
but
observing
that
the
victim
was
probably
fatally
wounded
he
thrust
it
back
into
its
holster
and
went
on
into
the
house
drawing
on
rubber
gloves
he
rapidly
blew
the
door
off
the
safe
with
and
took
out
everything
it
contained
he
set
aside
a
roll
of
blueprints
numerous
notebooks
some
money
and
other
valuables
and
a
small
vial
of
solution
but
of
the
larger
bottle
there
was
no
trace
he
then
ransacked
the
entire
house
from
cellar
to
attic
with
no
better
success
so
cleverly
was
the
entrance
to
the
vault
concealed
in
the
basement
wall
that
he
failed
to
discover
it
i
might
have
expected
this
of
crane
he
thought
half
aloud
after
all
the
warning
that
fool
brookings
persisted
in
giving
him
this
is
the
natural
result
of
his
nonsense
the
rest
of
the
solution
is
probably
in
the
safest
vault
in
the
united
states
but
i
got
their
plans
and
notes
and
enough
solution
for
the
present
i
get
the
rest
of
it
when
i
want
it
there
more
than
one
way
to
kill
any
cat
that
ever
lived
returning
to
the
machine
duquesne
calmly
stepped
over
the
bodies
of
the
detectives
and
the
unconscious
form
of
the
dying
japanese
who
was
uttering
an
occasional
groan
he
started
the
engine
and
took
his
seat
there
was
an
increasing
roar
as
he
opened
the
throttle
and
soon
he
descended
upon
the
field
from
which
he
had
set
out
he
noted
that
there
was
a
man
in
an
automobile
at
some
distance
from
the
hangar
evidently
waiting
to
take
care
of
the
plane
and
his
still
unconscious
passenger
rapidly
resuming
his
ordinary
clothing
he
stepped
into
his
automobile
and
was
soon
back
in
his
own
rooms
poring
over
the
blueprints
and
notebooks
seaton
and
crane
both
felt
that
something
was
wrong
when
they
approached
the
landing
field
and
saw
that
the
were
not
burning
as
they
always
were
kept
lighted
whenever
the
plane
was
abroad
after
dark
by
the
dim
light
of
the
old
moon
crane
made
a
bumpy
landing
and
they
sprang
from
their
seats
and
hastened
toward
the
house
as
they
neared
it
they
heard
a
faint
moan
and
turned
toward
the
sound
seaton
whipping
out
his
electric
torch
with
one
hand
and
his
automatic
pistol
with
the
other
at
the
sight
that
met
their
eyes
however
he
hastily
replaced
the
weapon
and
bent
over
shiro
a
touch
assuring
him
that
the
other
two
were
beyond
the
reach
of
help
silently
they
picked
up
the
injured
man
and
carried
him
gently
into
his
own
room
barely
glancing
at
the
wrecked
safe
on
the
way
seaton
applied
treatment
to
the
ghastly
wound
in
shiro
head
which
both
men
supposed
to
be
certainly
fatal
while
crane
called
a
noted
surgeon
asking
him
to
come
at
once
he
then
telephoned
the
coroner
the
police
and
finally
prescott
with
whom
he
held
a
long
conversation
having
done
all
in
their
power
for
the
unfortunate
man
they
stood
at
his
bedside
their
anger
all
the
more
terrible
for
the
fact
that
it
was
silent
seaton
stood
with
every
muscle
tense
he
was
seething
with
rage
his
face
purple
and
his
eyes
almost
emitting
sparks
his
teeth
clenched
until
the
muscles
of
his
jaws
stood
out
in
bands
and
lumps
his
right
hand
gripped
the
butt
of
his
pistol
while
under
his
left
the
brass
rail
of
the
bed
slowly
bent
under
the
intensity
of
his
unconscious
muscular
effort
crane
stood
still
apparently
impassive
but
with
his
face
perfectly
white
and
with
every
feature
stern
and
cold
as
though
cut
from
marble
seaton
was
the
first
to
speak
mart
he
gritted
his
voice
husky
with
fury
a
man
who
would
leave
another
man
alone
to
die
after
giving
him
that
ai
a
man
he
a
thing
if
shiro
dies
and
we
can
ever
find
out
who
did
it
i
shoot
him
with
the
biggest
explosive
charge
i
got
no
i
wo
either
be
too
sudden
i
take
him
apart
with
my
bare
hands
we
will
find
him
dick
crane
replied
in
a
level
deadly
voice
entirely
unlike
his
usual
tone
that
is
one
thing
money
can
do
we
will
get
him
if
money
influence
and
detectives
can
do
it
the
tension
was
relieved
by
the
arrival
of
the
surgeon
and
his
two
nurses
who
set
to
work
with
the
rapidity
and
precision
of
their
craft
after
a
few
minutes
the
work
completed
the
surgeon
turned
to
the
two
men
who
had
been
watching
him
so
intently
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
merely
a
scalp
wound
crane
he
stated
he
should
recover
consciousness
in
an
hour
or
so
then
breaking
in
upon
exclamation
it
looks
much
worse
than
it
really
is
the
bullet
glanced
off
the
skull
instead
of
penetrating
it
stunning
him
by
the
force
of
the
blow
there
are
no
indications
that
the
brain
is
affected
in
any
way
and
while
the
affected
area
of
the
scalp
is
large
it
is
a
clean
wound
and
should
heal
rapidly
he
will
probably
be
up
and
around
in
a
couple
of
days
and
by
the
time
his
hair
grows
again
he
will
not
be
able
to
find
a
scar
as
he
took
his
leave
the
police
and
coroner
arrived
after
making
a
thorough
investigation
in
which
they
learned
what
had
been
stolen
and
shrewdly
deduced
the
manner
in
which
the
robbery
had
been
accomplished
they
departed
taking
with
them
the
bodies
they
were
authorized
by
crane
to
offer
a
reward
of
one
million
dollars
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
the
murderer
after
everyone
except
the
nurses
had
gone
crane
showed
them
the
rooms
they
were
to
occupy
while
caring
for
the
wounded
man
as
the
surgeon
had
foretold
shiro
soon
recovered
consciousness
after
telling
his
story
he
dropped
into
a
deep
sleep
and
seaton
and

after
another
telephonic
conference
with
prescott
retired
for
the
rest
of
the
night
chapter
vi
the
at
work
prescott
after
a
sleepless
night
joined
seaton
and
crane
at
breakfast
what
do
you
make
of
it
mr
prescott
asked
crane
seaton
here
thinks
it
was
duquesne
possibly
acting
for
some
foreign
power
after
our
to
use
in
war
i
think
it
was
some
big
industrial
concern
after
our
what
is
your
opinion
i
have
any
replied
the
great
detective
after
a
moment
either
guess
may
be
true
although
i
am
almost
positive
that
duquesne
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
either
way
it
was
no
ordinary
burglary
that
is
certain
from
shiro
story
it
was
done
by
someone
who
had
exact
information
of
your
movements
and
habits
he
chose
a
time
when
you
were
away
probably
not
so
much
from
fear
of
you
as
because
it
was
only
in
your
absence
that
he
could
succeed
as
he
did
in
getting
all
the
guards
out
at
once
where
he
could
handle
them
he
was
a
man
with
one
accomplice
or
who
worked
alone
and
who
was
almost
exactly
seaton
size
and
build
he
was
undoubtedly
an
expert
as
he
blew
the
safe
and
searched
the
whole
house
without
leaving
a
or
any
other
clue
however
slight
that
i
can
find
a
thing
i
have
never
before
seen
done
in
all
my
experience
his
size
should
help
in
locating
him
declared
crane
while
there
are
undoubtedly
thousands
of
men
of
dick
and
they
are
fairly
well
scattered
are
they
not
yes
they
are
but
his
very
size
only
makes
it
worse
i
have
gone
over
all
the
records
i
could
in
the
short
time
i
have
had
and
ca
find
an
expert
of
that
class
with
anywhere
near
that
description
how
about
the
third
guard
the
one
who
escaped
asked
seaton
he
was
here
it
was
his
afternoon
off
you
know
and
he
said
that
he
would
come
back
into
this
job
on
a
bet
that
he
was
afraid
of
anything
ordinary
but
he
did
like
the
looks
of
things
out
here
that
sounded
fishy
to
me
and
i
fired
him
he
may
have
been
the
leak
of
course
though
i
have
always
found
him
reliable
before
if
he
did
leak
he
must
have
got
a
whale
of
a
slice
for
it
he
is
under
constant
watch
and
if
we
can
ever
get
anything
on
him
i
will
nail
him
to
the
cross
but
that
does
help
get
this
affair
straightened
out
i
have
given
up
of
course
there
are
lots
of
things
not
tried
yet
but
i
must
admit
that
temporarily
at
least
i
am
up
a
stump
well
remarked
seaton
that
reward
will
bring
him
in
sure
no
honor
that
ever
existed
among
thieves
or
even
among
of
diplomacy
could
stand
that
strain
i
not
so
sure
of
that
dick
said
crane
if
either
one
of
our
ideas
is
the
right
one
very
few
men
would
know
enough
about
the
affair
to
give
pertinent
information
and
they
probably
would
not
live
long
enough
to
enjoy
the
reward
very
thoroughly
even
a
million
dollars
fails
in
that
case
i
rather
agree
with
crane
seaton
if
it
were
an
ordinary
affair
and
i
am
as
sure
it
is
not
as
the
police
are
that
it
is
a
reward
of
that
size
would
get
us
our
man
within
two
days
as
it
is
i
doubt
very
much
that
the
reward
will
do
us
any
good
i
afraid
that
it
will
never
be
claimed
wonder
if
the
secret
service
could
help
us
out
they
be
interested
if
it
should
turn
out
to
be
some
foreign
power
i
took
it
up
with
the
chief
himself
just
after
it
happened
last
night
he
does
think
that
it
can
be
a
foreign
country
he
has
their
agents
pretty
well
spotted
and
the
only
one
that
could
fill
the
bill
you
know
a
man
with
that
description
and
with
the
cold
nerve
to
do
the
job
would
be
apt
to
be
known
was
in
san
francisco
the
time
this
job
was
pulled
off
the
more
you
talk
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
it
was
duquesne
himself
declared
seaton
positively
he
is
almost
exactly
my
size
and
build
is
the
only
man
i
know
of
who
could
do
anything
with
the
solution
after
he
got
it
and
he
has
nerve
enough
to
do
anything
i
would
like
to
think
it
was
duquesne
replied
the
detective
thoughtfully
but
i
afraid
we
have
to
count
him
out
of
it
entirely
he
has
been
under
the
constant
surveillance
of
my
best
men
ever
since
you
mentioned
him
we
have
detectaphones
in
his
rooms
wires
on
his
telephone
and
are
watching
him
night
and
day
he
never
goes
out
except
to
work
never
has
any
except
unimportant
telephone
calls
and
the
instruments
register
only
the
occasional
scratching
of
a
match
the
rustle
of
papers
and
other
noises
of
a
man
studying
he
innocent
that
may
be
true
assented
seaton
doubtfully
but
you
want
to
remember
that
he
knows
more
about
electricity
than
the
guy
that
invented
it
and
i
not
sure
that
he
ca
talk
to
a
detectaphone
and
make
it
say
anything
he
wants
it
to
anyway
we
can
soon
settle
it
yesterday
i
made
a
special
trip
down
to
the
bureau
with
some
notes
as
an
excuse
to
set
this
on
him
taking
one
of
the
small
instruments
from
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
i
watched
him
a
while
last
night
then
fixed
an
alarm
to
wake
me
if
the
needle
moved
much
but
it
pointed
steady
all
night
see
it
moving
now
that
means
that
he
is
going
to
work
early
as
usual
now
i
morally
certain
that
he
mixed
up
in
this
thing
somewhere
and
i
not
convinced
that
he
is
slipping
one
over
on
your
men
some
way
he
a
clever
devil
i
wonder
if
you
would
take
this
compass
and
watch
him
yourself
tonight
just
on
general
principles
or
let
me
do
it
i
be
glad
to
i
say
because
if
he
did
get
the
stuff
here
he
did
deliver
it
anywhere
last
night
it
just
a
chance
of
course
but
he
may
do
it
tonight
after
the
compass
had
been
explained
to
the
detective
he
gladly
consented
to
the
plan
declaring
that
he
would
willingly
spend
the
time
just
to
watch
such
an
instrument
work
after
another
hour
of
fruitless
discussion
prescott
took
his
leave
saying
that
he
would
mount
an
impregnable
guard
from
that
time
on
late
that
evening
prescott
joined
the
two
men
who
were
watching
duquesne
house
they
reported
that
all
was
perfectly
quiet
as
usual
the
scientist
was
in
his
library
the
instruments
registering
only
the
usual
occasional
faint
sounds
of
a
man
absorbed
in
study
but
after
an
hour
of
waiting
and
while
the
microphones
made
a
noise
as
of
rustling
papers
the
needle
of
the
compass
moved
it
dipped
slowly
toward
the
earth
as
though
duquesne
were
descending
into
the
cellar
but
at
the
same
time
the
shadow
of
his
unmistakable
profile
was
thrown
upon
the
window
shade
as
he
apparently
crossed
the
room
ca
you
hear
him
walk
demanded
prescott
no
he
has
heavy
turkish
rugs
all
over
the
library
and
he
always
walks
very
lightly
besides
prescott
watched
the
needle
in
amazement
as
it
dipped
deeper
and
deeper
pointing
down
into
the
earth
almost
under
his
feet
and
then
behind
him
as
though
duquesne
had
walked
beneath
him
he
did
not
could
not
believe
it
he
was
certain
that
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
strange
instrument
in
his
hand
nevertheless
he
followed
the
pointing
needle
it
led
him
beside
park
road
down
the
hill
straight
toward
the
long
bridge
which
forms
one
entrance
to
rock
creek
park
though
skeptical
prescott
took
no
chances
and
as
he
approached
the
bridge
he
left
the
road
and
concealed
himself
behind
a
clump
of
trees
from
which
point
of
vantage
he
could
see
the
ground
beneath
the
bridge
as
well
as
the
roadway
soon
the
bridge
trembled
under
the
weight
of
a
heavy
automobile
going
toward
the
city
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
he
saw
duquesne
with
a
roll
of
papers
under
his
arm
emerge
from
under
the
bridge
just
in
time
to
leap
aboard
the
automobile
which
slowed
down
only
enough
to
enable
him
to
board
it
in
safety
the
detective
noticed
that
the
car
was
a
limousine
a
car
not
common
even
in
washington
and
rushed
out
to
get
its
number
but
the
license
plates
were
so
smeared
with
oil
and
dust
that
the
numbers
could
not
be
read
by
the
light
of
the
tail
lamp
glancing
at
the
compass
in
his
hand
he
saw
that
the
delicate
needle
was
now
pointing
steadily
at
the
fleeing
car
and
all
doubts
as
to
the
power
of
the
instrument
were
dispelled
he
rejoined
his
men
informed
them
that
duquesne
had
eluded
them
and
took
one
of
them
up
the
hill
to
a
nearby
garage
there
he
engaged
a
fast
car
and
set
out
in
pursuit
choosing
the
path
for
the
chauffeur
by
means
of
the
compass
his
search
ended
at
the
residence
of
brookings
the
general
manager
of
the
great
world
steel
corporation
here
he
dismissed
the
car
and
watched
the
house
while
his
assistant
went
to
bring
out
the
fast
motorcycle
used
by
prescott
when
high
speed
was
desirable
after
four
hours
a
small
car
bearing
the
license
number
of
a
distant
state
which
was
found
by
subsequent
telegraphing
to
be
unknown
to
the
authorities
of
that
state
drove
under
the
and
the
hidden
watcher
saw
duquesne
without
the
papers
step
into
it
knowing
now
what
to
expect
prescott
drove
his
racing
motorcycle
at
full
speed
out
to
the
park
road
bridge
and
concealed
himself
beneath
the
structure
in
a
position
commanding
a
view
of
the
concrete
abutment
through
which
the
scientist
must
have
come
soon
he
heard
a
car
slow
down
overhead
heard
a
few
rapid
footfalls
and
saw
the
dark
form
of
a
large
man
outlined
against
the
gray
face
of
the
abutment
he
saw
the
man
lift
his
hand
high
above
his
head
and
saw
a
black
rectangle
appear
in
the
gray
engulf
the
man
and
disappear
after
a
few
minutes
he
approached
the
abutment
and
searched
its
face
with
the
help
of
his
he
finally
succeeded
in
tracing
the
almost
imperceptible
crack
which
outlined
the
door
and
the
concealed
button
which
duquesne
had
pressed
to
open
it
he
did
not
press
the
button
as
it
might
be
connected
to
an
alarm
deep
in
thought
he
mounted
his
motorcycle
and
made
his
way
to
his
home
to
get
a
few
hours
of
sleep
before
reporting
to
crane
whom
he
was
scheduled
to
see
at
breakfast
next
morning
both
men
were
waiting
for
him
when
he
appeared
and
he
noticed
with
pleasure
that
shiro
with
a
head
was
insisting
that
he
was
perfectly
able
to
wait
on
the
table
instead
of
breakfasting
in
bed
he
calmly
proceeded
to
serve
breakfast
in
spite
of
remonstrances
having
ceremoniously
ordered
out
of
the
kitchen
the
colored
man
who
had
been
secured
to
take
his
place
well
gentlemen
the
detective
began
part
of
the
mystery
is
straightened
out
i
was
entirely
wrong
and
each
of
you
were
partly
right
it
was
duquesne
in
all
probability
it
is
equally
probable
that
a
great
company
in
this
case
the
world
steel
corporation
is
backing
him
though
i
do
believe
there
is
a
ghost
of
a
show
of
ever
being
able
to
prove
it
in
law
your
did
the
trick
he
narrated
all
the
events
of
the
previous
night
i
like
to
send
him
to
the
chair
for
this
job
said
seaton
with
rising
anger
we
ought
to
shoot
him
anyway
damn
him
i
sorry
duels
have
gone
out
of
fashion
for
i
ca
shoot
him
the
way
things
are
now
i
sure
wish
i
could
no
you
can
not
shoot
him
said
crane
thoughtfully
and
neither
can
i
worse
luck
we
are
not
in
his
class
there
and
you
must
not
fight
with
him
either
noting
that
seaton
powerful
hands
had
doubled
into
fists
the
knuckles
showing
white
through
the
tanned
skin
though
that
would
be
a
fight
worth
watching
and
i
would
like
to
see
you
give
him
the
beating
of
his
life
a
little
thing
like
a
beating
is
not
a
fraction
of
what
he
deserves
and
it
would
show
him
that
we
have
found
him
out
no
we
must
do
it
legally
or
let
him
entirely
alone
you
think
there
is
no
hope
of
proving
it
prescott
frankly
i
see
very
little
chance
of
it
there
is
always
hope
of
course
and
if
that
bunch
of
pirates
ever
makes
a
slip
we
be
right
there
waiting
to
catch
while
i
do
believe
in
holding
out
false
encouragement
they
never
slipped
yet
i
take
my
men
off
duquesne
now
that
we
linked
him
up
with
steel
it
does
make
any
difference
does
it
whether
he
goes
to
them
every
night
or
only
once
a
week
no
then
about
all
i
can
do
is
to
get
everything
i
can
on
that
steel
crowd
and
that
is
very
much
like
trying
to
get
blood
out
of
a
turnip
i
intend
to
keep
after
them
of
course
for
i
owe
them
something
for
killing
two
of
my
men
here
as
well
as
for
other
favors
they
have
done
me
in
the
past
but
do
expect
too
much
i
have
tackled
them
before
and
so
have
police
headquarters
and
even
the
secret
service
itself
under
cover
and
all
that
any
of
us
has
been
able
to
get
is
an
occasional
small
fish
we
could
never
land
the
big
fellows
in
fact
we
have
never
found
the
slightest
material
proof
of
what
we
are
morally
certain
is
the
truth
that
world
steel
is
back
of
a
lot
of
deviltry
all
over
the
country
the
little
fellows
who
do
the
work
either
do
know
anything
or
are
afraid
to
tell
i
see
if
i
can
find
out
what
they
are
doing
with
the
stuff
they
stole
but
i
not
even
sure
of
doing
that
you
ca
plant
instruments
on
that
bunch
it
would
be
like
trying
to
stick
a
pin
into
a
sleeping
cat
without
waking
him
up
they
undoubtedly
have
one
of
the
best
corps
of
detectives
in
the
world
you
have
perfected
an
instrument
which
enables
you
to
see
into
a
closed
room
and
hear
what
is
going
on
there
have
you
and
upon
being
assured
that
they
had
not
he
took
his
leave
optimistic
cuss
ai
he
remarked
seaton
he
has
cause
to
be
dick
world
steel
is
a
soulless
corporation
if
there
ever
was
one
they
have
the
shrewdest
lawyers
in
the
country
and
they
get
away
legally
with
things
that
are
flagrantly
illegal
such
as
freezing
out
competitors
stealing
patents
and
the
like
report
has
it
that
they
do
not
stop
at
arson
treason
or
murder
to
attain
their
ends
but
as
prescott
said
they
never
leave
any
legal
proof
behind
them
well
should
fret
anyway
of
course
a
monopoly
is
what
after
but
they
ca
form
one
because
they
ca
possibly
get
the
rest
of
our
solution
even
if
they
should
get
it
we
can
get
more
it
be
as
easy
as
this
last
batch
was
since
the
x
was
undoubtedly
present
in
some
particular
lot
of
platinum
in
extraordinary
quantities
but
now
that
i
know
exactly
what
to
look
for
i
can
find
more
so
they
ca
get
their
monopoly
unless
they
kill
us
off
exactly
go
on
i
see
you
are
getting
the
idea
if
we
should
both
conveniently
die
they
could
get
the
solution
from
the
company
and
have
the
monopoly
since
no
one
else
can
handle
it
but
they
could
get
away
with
it
mart
never
in
a
thousand
years
even
if
they
wanted
to
of
course
i
am
small
fry
but
you
are
too
big
a
man
for
even
steel
to
do
away
with
it
ca
be
done
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
airplane
accidents
are
numerous
and
i
am
an
aviator
also
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
the
heavy
forging
for
the
skylark
ordered
a
while
ago
are
of
steel
seaton
paused
dumbfounded
in
the
act
of
lighting
his
pipe
but
thanks
to
your
we
are
warned
crane
continued
evenly
those
forgings
are
going
through
the
most
complete
set
of
tests
known
to
the
industry
and
if
they
go
into
the
skylark
at
all
it
will
be
after
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
they
will
not
give
way
on
our
first
trip
into
space
but
we
can
do
nothing
until
the
steel
arrives
and
with
the
guard
prescott
has
here
now
we
are
safe
enough
luckily
the
enemy
knows
nothing
of
the
or
the
and
we
must
keep
them
in
ignorance
hereinafter
not
even
the
guards
get
a
look
at
anything
we
do
they
sure
do
let
get
busy
duquesne
and
brookings
met
in
conference
in
a
private
room
of
the
perkins
caf√©
what
the
good
word
doctor
replied
the
scientist
the
stuff
is
all
they
said
it
was
but
we
have
enough
of
it
to
build
much
of
a
we
ca
go
ahead
with
it
anyway
as
long
as
seaton
and
crane
have
nearly
all
their
original
solution
no
we
ca
we
must
find
a
way
of
getting
it
i
see
now
that
we
should
have
done
as
you
suggested
and
taken
it
before
they
had
warning
and
put
it
out
of
our
reach
there
no
use
holding
we
got
to
get
it
some
way
and
everybody
that
knows
anything
about
that
new
metal
how
to
get
it
or
how
to
handle
it
must
die
at
first
it
would
have
been
enough
to
kill
seaton
now
however
there
is
no
doubt
that
crane
knows
all
about
it
and
he
probably
has
left
complete
instructions
in
case
he
gets
killed
in
an
accident
he
the
kind
that
would
we
will
have
to
keep
our
eyes
open
and
wipe
out
those
instructions
and
anyone
who
has
seen
them
you
see
that
do
you
yes
i
am
afraid
that
is
the
only
way
out
we
must
have
the
monopoly
and
anyone
who
might
be
able
to
interfere
with
it
must
be
removed
how
has
your
search
for
more
x
prospered
about
as
well
as
i
expected
we
bought
up
all
the
platinum
wastes
we
could
get
and
reworked
all
the
metallic
platinum
and
allied
metals
we
could
buy
in
the
open
market
and
got
less
than
a
gram
of
x
out
of
the
whole
lot
it
scarcer
than
radium
seaton
finding
so
much
of
it
at
once
was
an
accident
pure
and
simple
it
could
happen
once
in
a
million
years
well
have
you
any
suggestions
as
to
how
we
can
get
that
solution
no
i
have
thought
of
anything
but
that
very
thing
ever
since
i
found
that
they
had
hidden
it
and
i
ca
yet
see
any
good
way
of
getting
it
my
forte
is
direct
action
and
that
fails
in
this
case
since
no
amount
of
force
or
torture
could
make
crane
reveal
the
of
the
solution
it
probably
in
the
safest
vault
in
the
country
he
would
carry
the
key
on
him
probably
would
have
it
in
the
house
killing
seaton
or
crane
or
both
of
them
is
easy
enough
but
it
probably
would
get
us
the
solution
as
i
have
no
doubt
that
crane
has
provided
for
everything
probably
he
has
but
if
he
should
disappear
the
stuff
would
have
to
come
to
light
or
the
company
might
start
their
in
that
case
we
probably
could
get
it
you
mean
that
method
is
too
slow
to
suit
me
though
it
would
take
months
perhaps
years
and
would
be
devilishly
uncertain
to
boot
they
know
something
is
in
the
wind
and
the
stuff
will
be
surrounded
by
every
safeguard
they
can
think
of
there
must
be
some
better
way
than
that
but
i
have
been
able
to
think
of
it
neither
have
i
but
your
phrase
action
gives
me
an
idea
you
say
that
that
method
has
failed
what
do
you
think
of
trying
indirect
action
in
the
shape
of
perkins
who
is
indirection
personified
bring
him
in
he
may
be
able
to
figure
out
something
perkins
was
called
in
and
the
main
phases
of
the
situation
laid
before
him
the
three
men
sat
in
silence
for
many
minutes
while
the
crafty
strategist
studied
the
problem
finally
he
spoke
there
only
one
way
gentlemen
we
must
get
a
handle
on
either
seaton
or
crane
strong
enough
to
make
them
give
up
their
bottle
of
dope
their
plans
and
everything
handle
interrupted
duquesne
you
talk
like
a
fool
you
ca
get
anything
on
either
of
them
you
misunderstand
me
doctor
you
can
get
a
handle
of
some
kind
on
any
living
man
not
necessarily
in
his
past
you
understand
i
know
that
anything
like
that
is
out
of
the
question
in
this
case
but
in
his
future
with
some
men
it
is
money
with
others
power
with
others
fame
with
others
women
or
some
woman
and
so
on
down
the
list
what
can
we
use
here
money
is
out
of
the
question
so
are
power
and
fame
as
they
already
have
both
in
plain
sight
it
seems
to
me
that
women
would
be
our
best
chance
hah
snorted
the
chemist
crane
has
been
chased
by
all
the
women
of
three
continents
so
long
that
he
womanproof
seaton
is
worse
engaged
and
would
realize
that
a
woman
was
on
his
trail
even
if
you
could
find
a
better
looking
one
to
work
on
him
than
the
girl
engaged
to
which
would
be
a
hard
job
cleopatra
herself
could
swing
that
order
engaged
that
makes
it
simple
as
a
b
simple
in
the
devil
name
how
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
you
have
enough
of
the
dope
to
build
a
from
those
plans
have
you
yes
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
case
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it
i
would
suggest
that
we
build
such
a
car
and
use
it
to
carry
off
the
girl
after
we
have
her
safe
we
could
tell
seaton
that
she
is
marooned
on
some
distant
planet
and
that
she
will
be
returned
to
earth
only
after
all
the
solution
all
notes
plans
and
everything
pertaining
to
the
new
metal
are
surrendered
that
will
bring
him
and
crane
will
consent
then
afterward
seaton
may
go
away
indefinitely
and
if
desirable
crane
may
accompany
him
but
suppose
they
try
to
fight
asked
brookings
perkins
slid
down
into
his
chair
in
deep
thought
his
pale
eyes
under
lids
darting
here
and
there
his
stubby
fingers
worrying
his
restlessly
who
is
the
girl
he
asked
at
last
dorothy
vaneman
the
daughter
of
the
lawyer
she
that
beauty
that
the
papers
were
so
full
of
when
she
came
out
last
year
vaneman
is
a
director
in
the
company
that
makes
it
still
better
if
they
show
fight
and
follow
us
that
beautiful
car
we
are
making
for
them
will
collapse
and
they
will
be
out
of
the
way
vaneman
as
seaton
prospective
and
a
member
of
his
company
probably
knows
something
about
the
secret
maybe
all
of
it
with
his
daughter
in
a
supposedly
out
in
space
and
seaton
and
crane
out
of
the
way
vaneman
would
listen
to
reason
and
let
go
of
the
solution
particularly
as
nobody
knows
much
about
it
except
seaton
and
crane
that
strikes
me
as
a
perfectly
feasible
plan
said
brookings
but
you
would
really
take
her
to
another
planet
would
you
why
not
use
an
automobile
or
an
airplane
and
tell
seaton
that
it
was
a
i
would
advise
that
he
might
not
believe
it
and
they
might
make
a
lot
of
trouble
it
must
be
a
real
even
if
we
do
take
her
out
of
the
city
to
make
it
more
impressive
you
should
take
her
in
plain
sight
of
seaton
no
that
would
be
too
dangerous
as
i
have
found
out
from
the
police
that
seaton
has
a
permit
to
carry
arms
and
i
know
that
he
is
one
of
the
fastest
men
with
a
pistol
in
the
whole
country
do
it
in
plain
sight
of
her
folks
say
or
a
crowd
of
people
being
masked
of
course
or
dressed
in
an
aviator
suit
with
the
hood
and
goggles
on
take
her
straight
up
out
of
sight
then
hide
her
somewhere
until
seaton
listens
to
reason
i
know
that
he
listen
but
if
he
does
you
might
let
him
see
you
start
out
to
visit
her
he
be
sure
to
follow
you
in
their
rotten
car
as
soon
as
he
does
that
he
our
meat
but
that
raises
the
question
of
who
is
going
to
drive
the
car
i
am
replied
duquesne
i
will
need
some
help
though
as
at
least
one
man
must
stay
with
the
girl
while
i
bring
the
car
back
we
do
want
to
let
anybody
else
in
on
this
if
we
can
help
it
cautioned
brookings
you
could
go
along
could
you
perkins
is
it
safe
absolutely
answered
duquesne
they
have
everything
worked
out
to
the
queen
taste
that
all
right
then
i
take
the
trip
also
turning
to
brookings
it
will
help
in
another
little
thing
we
are
doing
the
spencer
affair
have
you
got
that
stuff
away
from
her
yet
after
having
had
her
locked
up
in
that
for
two
months
asked
brookings
no
she
stubborn
as
a
mule
we
given
her
the
third
degree
time
after
time
but
it
no
use
what
this
asked
duquesne
deviltry
in
the
main
office
yes
this
margaret
spencer
claims
that
we
swindled
her
father
out
of
an
invention
and
indirectly
caused
his
death
she
secured
a
position
with
us
in
search
of
evidence
she
is
an
expert
stenographer
and
showed
such
ability
that
she
was
promoted
until
she
became
my
secretary
our
detectives
must
have
been
asleep
as
she
made
away
with
some
photographs
and
drawings
before
they
caught
her
she
has
no
real
evidence
of
course
but
she
might
cause
trouble
with
a
jury
especially
as
she
is
one
of
the
women
in
washington
perkins
is
holding
her
until
she
returns
the
stolen
articles
why
ca
you
kill
her
off
she
can
not
be
disposed
of
until
after
we
know
where
the
stuff
is
because
she
says
and
perkins
believes
that
the
evidence
will
show
up
in
her
effects
we
must
do
something
about
her
soon
as
the
search
for
her
is
dying
down
and
she
will
be
given
up
for
dead
what
the
idea
about
her
and
the
if
the
car
proves
reliable
we
might
actually
take
her
out
into
space
and
give
her
the
choice
between
telling
and
walking
back
she
has
nerve
enough
here
on
earth
to
die
before
giving
up
but
i
do
believe
any
human
being
would
be
game
to
go
it
alone
on
a
strange
world
wilt
i
believe
you
right
perkins
your
suggestions
are
the
best
way
out
do
you
think
so
doctor
yes
i
do
see
how
we
can
fail
we
sure
to
win
either
way
you
are
prepared
for
trouble
afterward
of
course
certainly
but
i
do
think
there
will
be
much
trouble
they
possibly
link
the
three
of
us
together
they
are
wise
to
you
are
they
doctor
not
a
chance
sneered
duquesne
they
ran
themselves
ragged
trying
to
get
something
on
me
but
they
could
do
it
they
have
given
me
up
as
a
bad
job
i
am
still
as
careful
as
ever
though
i
am
merely
a
pure
scientist
in
the
bureau
of
chemistry
all
three
laughed
and
perkins
left
the
room
the
talk
then
turned
to
the
construction
of
the
it
was
decided
to
rush
the
work
on
it
so
that
duquesne
could
familiarize
himself
with
its
operation
but
not
to
take
any
steps
in
the
actual
abduction
until
such
time
as
seaton
and
crane
were
nearly
ready
to
take
their
first
flight
so
that
they
could
pursue
the
abductors
in
case
seaton
was
still
obdurate
after
a
few
days
of
his
fianc√©e
absence
duquesne
insisted
that
the
car
should
mount
a
couple
of
heavy
guns
to
destroy
the
pursuing
car
if
the
faulty
members
should
happen
to
hold
together
long
enough
to
carry
it
out
into
space
after
a
long
discussion
in
which
every
detail
of
the
plan
was
carefully
considered
the
two
men
left
the
restaurant
by
different
exits
chapter
vii
the
trial
voyage
the
great
steel
forgings
which
were
to
form
the
framework
of
the
skylark
finally
arrived
and
were
hauled
into
the
testing
shed
there
behind
closed
doors
crane
inspected
every
square
inch
of
the
massive
members
with
a
lens
but
could
find
nothing
wrong
still
unsatisfied
he
fitted
up
an
electrical
testing
apparatus
in
order
to
search
out
flaws
which
might
be
hidden
beneath
the
surface
this
device
revealed
flaws
in
every
piece
and
after
thoroughly
testing
each
one
and
mapping
out
the
imperfections
he
turned
to
seaton
with
a
grave
face
worse
than
useless
every
one
of
them
they
are
barely
strong
enough
to
stand
shipment
they
figured
that
we
would
go
slowly
until
we
were
well
out
of
the
atmosphere
then
put
on
power
then
something
would
give
way
and
we
would
never
come
back
that
about
the
right
dope
i
guess
but
now
what
we
do
we
cancel
without
letting
them
know
we
onto
them
and
we
certainly
use
this
stuff
no
but
we
will
go
ahead
and
build
this
ship
anyway
so
that
they
will
think
that
we
are
going
ahead
with
it
at
the
same
time
we
will
build
another
one
about
four
times
this
size
in
absolute
secrecy
and
what
mean
absolute
secrecy
how
can
you
keep
steel
castings
and
forgings
of
that
size
secret
from
steel
i
know
a
chap
who
owns
and
operates
a
small
steel
plant
so
insignificant
relatively
that
he
has
not
yet
been
bought
out
or
frozen
out
by
steel
i
was
able
to
do
him
a
small
favor
once
and
i
am
sure
that
he
will
be
glad
to
return
it
we
will
not
be
able
to
oversee
the
work
that
is
a
drawback
we
can
get
macdougall
to
do
it
for
us
however
and
with
him
doing
the
work
we
can
rest
assured
that
there
will
be
nothing
off
color
even
steel
could
buy
macdougall
the
man
who
installed
the
intercontinental
plant
he
would
touch
a
little
job
like
this
with
a
pole
i
think
he
would
he
and
i
are
rather
friendly
and
after
i
tell
him
all
about
it
he
will
be
glad
to
take
it
it
means
building
the
first
interplanetary
vessel
you
know
would
steel
follow
him
up
if
he
should
go
to
work
on
a
mysterious
project
he
too
big
to
hide
no
he
will
go
camping
he
often
does
i
have
gone
with
him
several
times
when
we
were
completely
out
of
touch
with
civilization
for
two
months
at
a
time
now
about
the
ship
we
want
have
you
any
ideas
it
will
cost
more
than
our
entire
capital
that
is
easily
arranged
we
do
not
care
how
much
it
costs
seaton
began
to
object
to
drawing
so
heavily
upon
the
resources
of
his
friend
but
was
promptly
silenced
i
told
you
when
we
started
crane
said
flatly
that
your
solution
and
your
idea
are
worth
far
more
than
half
a
million
in
fact
they
are
worth
more
than
everything
i
have
no
more
talk
of
the
money
end
of
it
dick
all
right
we
build
a
regular
four
times
the
size
be
a
mart
i
glad
this
one
is
on
the
fritz
she
carry
a
bar
zowie
watch
our
smoke
and
say
why
would
it
be
a
good
idea
to
build
an
attractor
a
thing
like
an
but
mounting
a
bar
instead
of
a
needle
so
that
if
they
chase
us
in
space
we
can

quadrant

bullets
through

in
the

we
should
have
something
for

i
do
like
the
possibility
of
having
that
gang
of
pirates
after
us
and
nothing
to

with

we
will
do
both
those
things
but
we
should
make
the
big
enough
to
avert
any
possible
contingency

he

a

of

lately
double
she
is
with
a
skin
of
norwegian
armor
let
get
busy
they
made
the
necessary
alteration
in
the
plans
and
in
a
few
days
work
was
begun
upon
the
huge
steel
shell
in
the
little
mountain
the
work
was
done
under
the
constant
supervision
of
the
great
macdougall
by
men
who
had
been
in
his
employ
for
years
and
who
were
all
above
suspicion
while
it
was
being
built
seaton
and
crane
employed
a
force
of
men
and
went
ahead
with
the
construction
of
the
in
the
testing
shed
while
they
did
not
openly
slight
the
work
nearly
all
their
time
was
spent
in
the
house
perfecting
the
many
essential
things
which
were
to
go
into
the
real
skylark
there
was
the
attractor
for
which
they
had
to
perfect
a
special
sighting
apparatus
so
that
it
could
act
in
any
direction
and
yet
would
not
focus
upon
the
ship
itself
nor
anything
it
contained
there
were
many
other
things
it
was
in
this
work
that
the
strikingly
different
temperaments
and
abilities
of
the
two
men
were
most
clearly
revealed
seaton
strode
up
and
down
the
room
puffing
great
volumes
of
smoke
from
his
hot
and
reeking
briar
suggesting
methods
and
ideas
his
keen
mind
finding
the
way
over
around
or
through
the
apparently
insuperable
obstacles
which
beset
their
path
crane
seated
calmly
at
the
occasionally
inhaling
a
mouthful
of
smoke
from
one
of
his
cigarettes
mercilessly
tore
seaton
suggestions
to
shreds
pointing
out
their
weaknesses
proving
his
points
with
his
cold
incisive
reasoning
and
his
calculations
of
factors
stresses
and
strains
seaton
in
turn
would
find
a
remedy
for
every
defect
and
finally
the
idea
complete
and
perfect
crane
would
impale
it
upon
the
point
of
his
drafting
pencil
and
spread
it
in
every
detail
upon
the
paper
before
him
while
seaton
active
mind
leaped
to
the
next
problem
not
being
vitally
interested
in
the
thing
being
built
in
the
shed
they
did
not
know
that
to
the
flawed
members
were
being
attached
faulty
plates
by
imperfect
welding
even
if
they
had
been
interested
they
could
not
have
found
the
poor
workmanship
by
any
ordinary
inspection
for
it
was
being
done
by
a
picked
crew
of
experts
picked
by
perkins
but
to
make
things
even
perkins
crew
did
not
know
that
the
peculiar
instruments
installed
by
seaton
and
crane
of
which
their
foreman
took
many
photographs
were
not
real
instruments
and
were
made
only
nearly
enough
like
them
to
pass
inspection
they
were
utterly
useless
in
design
and
function
far
different
from
the
real
instruments
intended
for
the
skylark
finally
the
last
dummy
instrument
was
installed
in
the
worthless
which
the
friends
referred
to
between
themselves
as
the
cripple
a
name
which
seaton
soon
changed
to
old
crip
the
construction
crew
was
dismissed
after
crane
had
let
the
foreman
overhear
a
talk
between
seaton
and
himself
in
which
they
decided
not
to
start
for
a
few
days
as
they
had
some
final
experiments
to
make
prescott
reported
that
steel
had
relaxed
its
vigilance
and
was
apparently
waiting
for
the
first
flight
about
the
same
time
word
was
received
from
macdougall
that
the
real
skylark
was
ready
for
the
finishing
touches
a
huge
triplane
descended
upon
crane
field
and
was
loaded
to
its
capacity
with
strange
looking
equipment
when
it
left
seaton
and
crane
went
with
it
to
make
the
final
tests
before
the
first
flight
leaving
a
heavy
guard
over
the
house
and
the
testing
shed
a
few
nights
later
in
inky
blackness
a
huge
shape
descended
rapidly
in
front
of
the
shed
whose
ponderous
doors
opened
to
receive
it
and
closed
quickly
after
it
the
skylark
moved
lightly
and
easily
as
a
wafted
feather
betraying
its
thousands
of
tons
of
weight
only
by
the
hole
it
made
in
the
earth
of
the
floor
as
it
settled
to
rest
opening
one
of
the
heavy
doors
seaton
and
crane
sprang
out
into
the
darkness
dorothy
and
her
father
who
had
been
informed
that
the
skylark
was
to
be
brought
home
that
night
were
waiting
seaton
caught
up
his
sweetheart
in
one
mighty
arm
and
extended
his
hand
past
her
to
vaneman
who
seized
it
in
both
his
own
upon
the
young
man
face
was
the
look
of
a
victorious
king
returning
from
conquest
for
a
few
minutes
disconnected
exclamations
were
all
that
any
of
the
party
could
utter
then
seaton
loosening
slightly
his
bear
hold
upon
dorothy
spoke
she
flies
he
cried
exultantly
she
flies
dearest
like
a
ray
of
light
for
speed
and
like
a
bit
of
thistledown
for
lightness
we
been
around
the
moon
around
the
moon
cried
the
two
amazed
visitors
so
soon
asked
vaneman
when
did
you
start
almost
an
hour
ago
replied
crane
readily
he
had
already
taken
out
his
watch
his
voice
was
calm
his
face
quiet
but
to
those
who
knew
him
best
a
deeper
resonance
in
his
voice
and
a
deeper
blue
sparkle
in
his
eyes
betrayed
his
emotion
both
inventors
were
moved
more
than
they
could
have
told
by
their
achievement
by
the
complete
success
of
the
great
upon
which
they
had
labored
for
months
with
all
the
power
of
their
marvelous
intellects
seaton
stood
now
at
the
summit
of
his
pride
no
recognition
by
the
masses
no
applause
by
the
multitudes
no
praise
even
from
the
upper
ten
of
his
own
profession
could
equal
for
him
the
silent
adulation
of
the
two
before
him
dorothy
exquisite
face
was
glorified
as
she
looked
at
her
lover
her
eyes
wonderful
as
they
told
him
how
high
he
stood
above
all
others
in
her
world
how
much
she
loved
him
seeing
that
look
that
sweet
face
more
beautiful
than
ever
in
this
his
hour
of
triumph
that
perfect
adorable
body
seaton
forgot
the
others
and
a
more
profound
exaltation
than
that
brought
by
his
flight
filled
his
being
humble
thankfulness
that
he
was
the
man
to
receive
the
untold
treasure
of
her
great
giving
every
bit
of
mechanism
we
had
occasion
to
use
worked
perfectly
crane
stated
proudly
we
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
change
any
of
our
apparatus
and
we
hope
to
make
a
longer
flight
soon
the
hour
we
took
on
this
trip
might
easily
have
been
only
a
few
minutes
for
the
lark
did
not
even
begin
to
pick
up
speed
shiro
looked
at
crane
with
an
air
of
utter
devotion
and
bowed
until
his
head
approached
the
floor
sir
he
said
in
his
stilted
english
honorable
skylark
shall
be
marvelous
wonder
if
permitting
i
shall
luxuriate
in
preparing
suitable
refreshment
the
permission
granted
he
trotted
away
into
the
house
and
the
travelers
invited
their
visitors
to
inspect
the
new
craft
crane
and
the
older
man
climbed
through
the
circular
doorway
which
was
at
an
elevation
of
several
feet
above
the
ground
seaton
and
dorothy
exchanged
a
brief
but
enthusiastic
caress
before
he
lifted
her
lightly
up
to
the
opening
and
followed
her
up
a
short
flight
of
stairs
although
she
knew
what
to
expect
from
her
lover
descriptions
and
from
her
own
knowledge
of
old
crip
which
she
had
seen
many
times
she
caught
her
breath
in
amazement
as
she
stood
up
and
looked
about
the
interior
of
the
great
it
was
a
sight
such
as
had
never
before
been
seen
upon
earth
illustration
in
the
exact
center
of
the
huge
shell
was
a
spherical
network
of
enormous
steel
beams
inside
this
structure
could
be
seen
a
similar
network
which
mounted
upon
universal
bearings
was
free
to
revolve
in
any
direction
she
saw
a
spherical
shell
of
hardened
steel
fully
forty
feet
in
diameter
though
its
true
shape
was
not
readily
apparent
from
the
inside
as
it
was
divided
into
several
compartments
by
horizontal
floors
or
decks
in
the
exact
center
of
the
huge
shell
was
a
spherical
network
of
enormous
steel
beams
inside
this
structure
could
be
seen
a
similar
network
which
mounted
upon
universal
bearings
was
free
to
revolve
in
any
direction
this
inner
network
was
filled
with
machinery
surrounding
a
shining
copper
cylinder
from
the
outer
network
radiated
six
mighty
supporting
columns
these
branching
as
they
neared
the
hull
of
the
vessel
supported
the
and
steering
apparatus
in
the
center
and
so
strengthened
the
shell
that
the
whole
structure
was
nearly
as
strong
as
a
solid
steel
ball
she
noticed
that
the
floor
perhaps
eight
feet
below
the
center
was
heavily
upholstered
in
leather
and
did
not
seem
solid
and
that
the
same
was
true
of
the
dozen
or
more
seats
she
could
not
call
them
chairs
which
were
built
in
various
places
she
gazed
with
interest
at
the
two
instrument
boards
upon
which
flashed
tiny
lights
and
the
plate
glass
condensite
and
metal
of
many
instruments
the
use
of
which
she
could
not
guess
after
a
few
minutes
of
silence
both
visitors
began
to
ask
questions
and
seaton
showed
them
the
principal
features
of
the
novel
craft
crane
accompanied
them
in
silence
enjoying
their
pleasure
glorying
in
the
mighty
vessel
seaton
called
attention
to
the
great
size
and
strength
of
the
lateral
supporting
columns
one
of
which
was
immediately
above
their
heads
and
then
led
them
over
to
the
vertical
column
which
pierced
the
middle
of
the
floor
enormous
as
the
lateral
had
seemed
it
appeared
puny
in
comparison
with
this
monster
of
fabricated
steel
seaton
explained
that
the
two
verticals
were
many
times
stronger
than
the
four
laterals
as
the
center
of
gravity
of
the
ship
had
been
made
lower
than
its
geometrical
center
so
that
the
apparent
motion
of
the
vessel
and
therefore
the
power
of
the
bar
would
usually
be
merely
vertical
resting
one
hand
caressingly
upon
the
huge
column
he
exultantly
explained
that
these
members
were
the
last
word
in
strength
made
up
of
many
separate
and
angles
of
the
strongest
known
special
steel
latticed
and
braced
until
no
conceivable
force
could
make
them
yield
a
millimeter
but
why
such
strength
asked
the
lawyer
doubtfully
this
column
alone
would
hold
up
brooklyn
bridge
to
hold
down
the
so
that
the
bar
wo
tear
through
the
ship
when
we
cut
her
loose
replied
seaton
have
you
any
idea
how
fast
this
bird
can
fly
well
i
have
heard
you
speak
of
traveling
with
the
velocity
of
light
but
that
is
overdrawn
is
it
not
very
much
our
figures
show
that
with
this
bar
pointing
to
the
copper
cylinder
in
the
exact
center
of
the
inner
sphere
we
could
develop
not
only
the
velocity
of
light
but
an
acceleration
equal
to
that
velocity
were
it
not
for
the
increase
in
mass
at
high
velocities
as
shown
by
einstein
and
others
we
ca
go
very
fast
near
the
earth
of
course
as
the
friction
of
the
air
would
melt
the
whole
works
in
a
few
minutes
until
we
get
out
of
the
atmosphere
our
speed
will
be
limited
by
the
ability
of
steel
to
withstand
melting
by
the
friction
of
the
air
to
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
four
or
five
thousand
miles
per
hour
but
out
in
space
we
can
develop
any
speed
we
wish
up
to
that
of
light
as
a
limit
i
studied
physics
a
little
in
my
youth
would
the
mere
force
of
such
an
acceleration
as
you
mention
flatten
you
on
the
floor
and
hold
you
there
and
any
sudden
jar
would
certainly
kill
you
there
ca
be
any
sudden
jar
this
is
a
special
floor
you
notice
it
is
mounted
on
long
extremely
heavy
springs
to
take
up
any
possible
jar
also
whenever
we
are
putting
on
power
we
wo
try
to
stand
up
our
legs
would
crimple
up
like
strings
we
will
ride
securely
strapped
into
those
special
seats
which
are
mounted
the
same
as
the
floor
only
a
whole
lot
more
so
as
to
the
acceleration
that
word
means
picking
up
speed
does
it
interrupted
dorothy
the
rate
of
picking
up
speed
corrected
seaton
that
is
if
you
were
going
forty
miles
per
hour
one
minute
and
fifty
the
next
minute
your
acceleration
would
be
ten
miles
per
hour
per
minute
see
acceleration
that
makes
you
feel
funny
when
you
start
up
or
down
in
an
elevator
then
riding
in
this
thing
will
be
like
starting
up
in
an
elevator
so
that
your
heart
sinks
into
your
boots
and
you
ca
breathe
yes
only
worse
we
will
pick
up
speed
faster
and
keep
on
doing
it
seriously
interrupted
the
lawyer
do
you
think
that
the
human
body
can
stand
any
such
acceleration
as
that
i
do
know
we
are
going
to
find
out
by
starting
out
slowly
and
increasing
our
acceleration
to
as
much
as
we
can
stand
i
see
vaneman
replied
but
how
are
you
going
to
steer
her
how
do
you
keep
permanent
reference
points
since
there
are
no
directions
in
space
that
was
our
hardest
problem
explained
seaton
but
martin
solved
it
perfectly
see
the
up
there
notice
those
big
supporting
rings
and
bearings
well
the
is
entirely
separate
from
the
ship
as
it
is
inside
that
inner
sphere
about
which
the
outer
sphere
and
the
ship
itself
are
free
to
revolve
in
any
direction
no
matter
how
much
the
ship
rolls
and
pitches
as
she
is
bound
to
do
every
time
we
come
near
enough
to
any
star
or
planet
to
be
influenced
by
its
gravitation
the
bar
stays
where
it
is
pointed
those
six
big
jackets
in
the
outer
sphere
on
the
six
sides
of
the
bar
cover
six
pairs
of
gyroscope
wheels
weighing
several
tons
each
turning
at
a
terrific
speed
in
a
vacuum
the
gyroscopes
keep
the
whole
outer
sphere
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
long
as
they
are
kept
turning
and
afford
us
not
only
permanent
planes
of
reference
but
also
a
solid
foundation
in
those
planes
which
can
be
used
in
pointing
the
bar
the
bar
can
be
turned
instantly
to
any
direction
whatever
by
special
electrical
instruments
on
the
boards
you
see
the
outer
sphere
stays
immovably
fixed
in
that
position
with
the
bar
at
liberty
to
turn
in
any
direction
inside
it
and
the
ship
at
liberty
to
do
the
same
thing
outside
it
now
we
will
show
you
where
we
sleep
seaton
continued
we
have
eight
rooms
four
below
and
four
above
leading
the
way
to
a
narrow
steep
steel
stairway
and
down
into
a
very
narrow
hall
from
either
side
of
which
two
doors
opened
this
is
my
room
the
adjoining
one
is
mart
shiro
sleeps
across
the
hall
the
rest
of
the
rooms
are
for
our
guests
on
future
trips
sliding
back
the
door
he
switched
on
the
light
and
revealed
a
small
but
bedroom
completely
furnished
with
everything
necessary
yet
everything
condensed
into
the
least
possible
space
the
floor
like
the
one
above
was
of
cushioned
leather
supported
by
springs
the
bed
was
a
modification
of
the
special
seats
already
referred
to
opening
another
sliding
door
he
showed
them
an
equally
complete
and
equally
compact
bathroom
you
see
we
have
all
the
comforts
of
home
this
bathroom
however
is
practical
only
when
we
have
some
force
downward
either
gravitation
or
our
own
acceleration
the
same
reasoning
accounts
for
the
you
see
everywhere
on
board
drifting
in
space
you
know
there
is
no
weight
and
you
ca
walk
you
must
pull
yourself
around
if
you
tried
to
take
a
step
you
would
bounce
up
and
hit
the
ceiling
and
stay
there
that
is
why
the
ceilings
are
so
well
padded
and
if
you
tried
to
wash
your
face
you
would
throw
water
all
over
the
place
and
it
would
float
around
in
the
air
instead
of
falling
to
the
floor
as
long
as
we
can
walk
we
can
use
the
bathroom
if
i
should
want
to
wash
my
face
while
we
are
drifting
i
just
press
this
button
here
and
the
pilot
will
put
on
enough
acceleration
to
make
the
correct
use
of
water
possible
there
are
a
lot
of
surprising
things
about
a
trip
into
space
i
do
doubt
it
a
bit
and
i
simply
wild
to
go
for
a
ride
with
you
when
will
you
take
me
dicky
asked
dorothy
eagerly
very
soon
dottie
as
soon
as
we
get
her
in
perfect
running
condition
you
shall
be
the
first
to
ride
with
us
i
promise
you
where
do
you
cook
and
eat
how
do
you
see
out
how
about
the
air
and
water
supply
how
do
you
keep
warm
or
cool
as
the
case
may
be
asked
the
girl
father
as
though
he
were
a
witness
shiro
has
a
galley
on
the
main
floor
and
tables
fold
up
into
the
wall
of
the
main
compartment
the
passengers
see
out
by
sliding
back
steel
panels
which
normally
cover
the
windows
the
pilot
can
see
in
any
direction
from
his
seat
at
the
by
means
of
special
instruments
something
like
periscopes
the
windows
are
made
of
optical
glass
similar
to
that
used
in
the
largest
telescopes
they
are
nearly
as
thick
as
the
hull
and
have
a
compressive
resistance
almost
equal
to
that
of
armor
steel
although
so
thick
they
are
crystal
clear
and
a
speck
of
dust
on
the
outer
surface
is
easily
seen
we
have
water
enough
in
tanks
to
last
us
three
months
or
indefinitely
if
we
should
have
to
be
careful
as
we
can
automatically
distill
and
purify
all
our
waste
water
recovering
absolutely
pure
we
have
compressed
air
also
in
tanks
but
we
need
very
little
as
the
air
is
constantly
being
purified
also
we
have
apparatus
aboard
in
case
we
should
run
short
as
to
keeping
warm
we
have
electric
heating
coils
run
by
the
practically
inexhaustible
power
of
a
small
metal
bar
if
we
get
too
near
the
sun
and
get
too
warm
we
have
a
refrigerating
machine
to
cool
us
off
anything
else
you
better
give
up
dad
laughingly
advised
his
daughter
thought
of
everything
have
you
dick
mart
has
i
think
this
is
all
his
doing
you
know
i
would
have
thought
of
a
tenth
of
it
myself
i
must
remind
you
young
folks
said
the
older
man
glancing
at
his
watch
that
it
is
very
late
and
high
time
for
dottie
and
me
to
be
going
home
we
would
like
to
stay
and
see
the
rest
of
it
but
you
know
we
must
be
away
from
here
before
daylight
as
they
went
into
the
house
vaneman
asked
what
does
the
other
side
of
the
moon
look
like
i
have
always
been
curious
about
it
we
were
not
able
to
see
much
replied
crane
it
was
too
dark
and
we
did
not
take
the
time
to
explore
it
but
from
what
we
could
see
by
means
of
our
searchlights
it
is
very
much
like
this
side
the
most
barren
and
desolate
place
imaginable
after
we
go
to
mars
we
intend
to
explore
the
moon
thoroughly
mars
then
is
your
first
goal
when
do
you
intend
to
start
we
have
decided
definitely
probably
in
a
day
or
two
everything
is
ready
now
as
the
vanemans
had
come
out
in
the
street
car
in
order
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
seaton
volunteered
to
take
them
home
in
one
of
crane
cars
as
they
bade
crane
goodnight
after
enjoying
suitable
refreshment
the
lawyer
took
the
chauffeur
seat
motioning
his
daughter
and
seaton
into
the
closed
body
of
the
car
as
soon
as
they
had
started
dorothy
turned
in
the
embrace
of
her
lover
arm
dick
she
said
fiercely
i
would
have
been
worried
sick
if
i
had
known
that
you
were
way
off
there
i
knew
it
sweetheart
that
why
i
did
tell
you
we
were
going
we
both
knew
the
skylark
was
perfectly
safe
but
i
knew
that
you
would
worry
about
our
first
trip
now
that
we
have
been
to
the
moon
you
be
uneasy
when
we
go
to
mars
will
you
dear
i
ca
help
it
boy
i
will
be
afraid
that
something
terrible
has
happened
every
minute
wo
you
take
me
with
you
then
if
anything
happens
it
will
happen
to
both
of
us
and
that
is
as
it
should
be
you
know
that
i
would
want
to
keep
on
living
if
anything
happen
to
you
he
put
both
arms
around
her
as
his
reply
and
pressed
his
cheek
to
hers
dorothy
sweetheart
i
know
exactly
how
you
feel
i
feel
the
same
way
myself
i
awfully
sorry
dear
but
i
ca
do
it
i
know
the
machine
is
safe
but
i
got
to
prove
it
to
everybody
else
before
i
take
you
on
a
long
trip
with
me
your
father
will
agree
with
me
that
you
ought
not
to
go
on
the
first
trip
or
two
anyway
and
besides
what
would
madam
grundy
say
well
there
a
way
she
began
and
he
felt
her
face
turn
hot
his
arms
tightened
around
her
and
his
breath
came
fast
i
know
it
sweetheart
and
i
would
like
nothing
better
in
the
world
than
to
be
married
today
and
take
our
honeymoon
in
the
skylark
but
i
ca
do
it
after
we
come
back
from
the
first
long
trip
we
will
be
married
just
as
soon
as
you
say
ready
and
after
that
we
will
always
be
together
wherever
i
go
but
i
ca
take
even
the
millionth
part
of
a
chance
with
anything
as
valuable
as
you
are
you
see
that
do
you
dottie
i
suppose
so
she
returned
disconsolately
but
you
make
it
a
short
trip
for
my
sake
i
know
i
wo
rest
a
minute
until
you
get
back
i
promise
you
that
we
wo
be
gone
more
than
four
days
then
for
the
greatest
honeymoon
that
ever
was
and
they
clung
together
in
the
dark
body
of
the
car
each
busy
with
solemn
and
beautiful
thoughts
of
the
happiness
to
come
they
soon
reached
their
destination
as
they
entered
the
house
dorothy
made
one
more
attempt
dad
dick
is
just
too
perfectly
mean
he
says
he
wo
take
me
on
the
first
trip
if
you
were
going
out
there
would
mother
want
to
go
along
too
after
listening
to
seaton
he
gave
his
decision
dick
is
right
kitten
he
must
make
the
long
trip
first
then
after
the
machine
is
proved
reliable
you
may
go
with
him
i
can
think
of
no
better
way
of
spending
a
honeymoon
it
will
be
a
new
one
at
least
and
you
need
worry
about
the
boys
getting
back
safely
i
might
not
trust
either
of
them
alone
but
together
they
are
invincible
children
i
wish
you
success
dick
as
he
turned
away
seaton
took
a
lover
leave
of
dorothy
and
went
into
the
study
taking
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
vaneman
he
said
in
a
low
voice
we
think
the
steel
crowd
is
still
camping
on
our
trail
we
are
ready
for
them
with
a
lot
of
stuff
that
they
never
heard
of
but
in
case
anything
goes
wrong
martin
has
written
between
the
lines
of
this
legal
form
in
invisible
ink
exactly
how
to
get
possession
of
all
our
notes
and
plans
so
that
the
company
can
go
ahead
with
everything
with
those
directions
any
chemist
can
find
and
use
the
stuff
safely
please
put
this
envelope
in
the
safest
place
you
can
think
of
and
then
forget
it
unless
they
get
both
crane
and
me
there
about
one
chance
in
a
million
of
their
doing
that
but
mart
does
gamble
on
even
that
chance
he
is
right
dick
i
believe
that
you
can
outwit
them
in
any
situation
but
i
will
keep
this
paper
where
no
one
except
myself
can
ever
see
it
nevertheless
son
and
good
luck
the
same
to
you
sir
and
thank
you
author
of
this
story
being
a
chemist
of
high
standing
and
an
excellent
mathematician
gives
us
a
rare
gem
in
this
interplanetary
tale
for
one
thing
he
suggests
an
interesting
use
of
the
action
of
acceleration
in
this
instalment
it
is
made
to
take
the
place
of
gravity
when
the
interplanetary
vehicle
is
out
in
open
space
in
order
to
get
the
gravity
effect
a
positive
or
negative
acceleration
could
be
given
out
this
instalment
retains
its
easy
flow
of
language
and
continues
to
develop
surprise
episodes
with
a
remarkable
degree
of
chapter
viii
indirect
action
the
afternoon
following
the
homecoming
of
the
skylark
seaton
and
dorothy
returned
from
a
long
horseback
ride
in
the
park
after
seaton
had
mounted
his
motorcycle
dorothy
turned
toward
a
bench
in
the
shade
of
an
old
elm
to
watch
a
game
of
tennis
on
the
court
next
door
scarcely
had
she
seated
herself
when
a
great
ball
alighted
upon
the
lawn
in
front
of
her
a
heavy
steel
door
snapped
open
and
a
powerful
figure
clad
in
aviator
leather
the
face
completely
covered
by
the
hood
leaped
out
she
jumped
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
of
joyful
surprise
thinking
it
was
seaton
a
cry
which
died
suddenly
as
she
realized
that
seaton
had
just
left
her
and
that
this
vessel
was
far
too
small
to
be
the
skylark
she
turned
in
flight
but
the
stranger
caught
her
in
three
strides
she
found
herself
helpless
in
a
pair
of
arms
equal
in
strength
to
seaton
own
picking
her
up
lightly
as
a
baby
duquesne
carried
her
over
to
the
shriek
after
shriek
rang
out
as
she
found
that
her
utmost
struggles
were
of
no
avail
against
the
giant
strength
of
her
captor
that
her
nails
glanced
harmlessly
off
the
heavy
glass
and
leather
of
his
hood
and
that
her
teeth
were
equally
ineffective
against
his
suit
with
the
girl
in
his
arms
duquesne
stepped
into
the
vessel
and
as
the
door
clanged
shut
behind
them
dorothy
caught
a
glimpse
of
another
woman
tied
hand
and
foot
in
one
of
the
side
seats
of
the
car
tie
her
feet
perkins
duquesne
ordered
brusquely
holding
her
around
the
body
so
that
her
feet
extended
straight
out
in
front
of
him
a
wildcat
as
perkins
threw
one
end
of
a
small
rope
around
her
ankles
dorothy
doubled
up
her
knees
drawing
her
feet
as
far
away
from
him
as
possible
as
he
incautiously
approached
she
kicked
out
viciously
with
all
the
force
of
her
muscular
young
body
behind
her
heavy
the
sharp
heel
of
one
small
boot
struck
perkins
squarely
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
a
true
blow
and
completely
knocked
out
he
staggered
back
against
the
his
arm
pushed
the
speed
lever
clear
out
to
its
last
notch
throwing
the
entire
current
of
the
batteries
through
the
bar
which
was
pointed
straight
up
as
it
had
been
when
they
made
their
landing
and
closing
the
switch
which
threw
on
the
power
of
the
repelling
outer
coating
there
was
a
creak
of
the
mighty
steel
fabric
stressed
almost
to
its
limit
as
the
vessel
darted
upward
with
its
stupendous
velocity
and
only
the
floor
saved
their
lives
as
they
were
thrown
flat
and
held
there
by
the
awful
force
of
their
acceleration
as
the
tore
through
the
thin
layer
of
the
earth
atmosphere
so
terrific
was
their
speed
that
the
friction
of
the
air
did
not
have
time
to
set
them
afire
they
were
through
it
and
into
the
perfect
vacuum
of
interstellar
space
before
the
thick
steel
hull
was
even
warmed
through
dorothy
lay
flat
upon
her
back
just
as
she
had
fallen
unable
even
to
move
her
arms
gaining
each
breath
only
by
a
terrible
effort
perkins
was
a
huddled
heap
under
the
the
other
captive
brookings
was
in
somewhat
better
case
as
her
bonds
had
snapped
like
string
and
she
was
lying
at
full
length
in
one
of
the
forced
into
that
position
and
held
there
as
the
design
of
the
seats
was
adapted
for
the
most
comfortable
position
possible
under
such
conditions
she
like
dorothy
was
gasping
for
breath
her
straining
muscles
barely
able
to
force
air
into
her
lungs
because
of
the
paralyzing
weight
of
her
chest
duquesne
alone
was
able
to
move
and
it
required
all
of
his
herculean
strength
to
creep
and
crawl
toward
the
finally
attaining
his
goal
he
summoned
all
his
strength
to
grasp
not
the
controlling
lever
which
he
knew
was
beyond
his
reach
but
a
switch
only
a
couple
of
feet
above
his
head
with
a
series
of
convulsive
movements
he
fought
his
way
up
first
until
he
was
crouching
on
his
elbows
and
knees
and
then
into
a
squatting
position
placing
his
left
hand
under
his
right
he
made
a
last
supreme
effort
perspiration
streamed
from
him
his
mighty
muscles
stood
out
in
ridges
visible
even
under
the
heavy
leather
of
his
coat
his
lips
parted
in
a
snarl
over
his
locked
teeth
as
he
threw
every
ounce
of
his
wonderful
body
into
an
effort
to
force
his
right
hand
up
to
the
switch
his
hand
approached
it
slowly
closed
over
it
and
pulled
it
out
the
result
was
startling
with
the
mighty
power
instantly
cut
off
and
with
not
even
the
ordinary
force
of
gravitation
to
counteract
the
force
duquesne
was
exerting
his
own
muscular
effort
hurled
him
up
toward
the
center
of
the
car
and
against
the
the
switch
still
in
his
grasp
was
again
closed
his
shoulder
crashed
against
the
levers
which
controlled
the
direction
of
the
bar
swinging
it
through
a
wide
arc
as
the
ship
darted
off
in
the
new
direction
with
all
its
old
acceleration
he
was
hurled
against
the
instrument
board
tearing
one
end
loose
from
its
supports
and
falling
unconscious
to
the
floor
on
the
other
side
after
a
time
which
seemed
like
an
eternity
dorothy
and
the
other
girl
felt
their
senses
slowly
leave
them
with
four
unconscious
passengers
the
hurtled
through
empty
space
its
already
inconceivable
velocity
being
augmented
every
second
by
a
quantity
bringing
its
velocity
near
to
that
of
light
driven
onward
by
the
incredible
power
of
the
disintegrating
copper
bar
seaton
had
gone
only
a
short
distance
from
his
sweetheart
home
when
over
the
purring
of
his
engine
he
thought
he
heard
dorothy
voice
raised
in
a
scream
he
did
not
wait
to
make
sure
but
whirled
his
machine
about
and
the
purring
changed
instantly
to
a
staccato
roar
as
he
threw
open
the
throttle
and
advanced
the
spark
gravel
flew
from
beneath
his
skidding
wheels
as
he
negotiated
the
turn
into
the
vaneman
grounds
at
suicidal
speed
but
with
all
his
haste
he
arrived
upon
the
scene
just
in
time
to
see
the
door
of
the
close
before
he
could
reach
it
the
vessel
disappeared
with
nothing
to
mark
its
departure
save
a
violent
whirl
of
grass
and
sod
uprooted
and
carried
far
into
the
air
by
the
vacuum
of
its
wake
to
the
excited
and
the
screaming
mother
of
the
abducted
girl
it
seemed
as
though
the
great
metal
ball
had
vanished
utterly
only
seaton
knowing
what
to
expect
saw
the
line
it
made
in
the
air
and
saw
for
an
instant
a
minute
dot
in
the
sky
before
it
disappeared
interrupting
the
clamor
of
the
young
people
each
of
whom
was
trying
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
he
spoke
to
vaneman
mother
dottie
all
right
he
said
rapidly
but
gently
steel
got
her
but
they
wo
keep
her
long
do
worry
we
get
her
it
may
take
a
week
or
it
may
take
a
year
but
we
bring
her
back
and
leaping
upon
his
motorcycle
he
shattered
all
the
speed
laws
on
his
way
to
crane
house
mart
he
yelled
rushing
into
the
shop
they
got
dottie
in
a
bus
made
from
our
plans
let
go
as
he
started
on
a
run
for
the
testing
shed
wait
a
minute
crisply
shouted
crane
do
go
off
what
is
your
plan
plan
hell
barked
the
enraged
chemist
chase
which
way
did
they
go
and
when
straight
up
full
power
twenty
minutes
ago
too
long
ago
straight
up
has
changed
its
direction
several
degrees
since
then
they
may
have
covered
a
million
miles
or
they
may
have
come
back
and
landed
next
door
sit
down
and
think
we
need
all
your
brains
now
regaining
his
as
the
wisdom
of
his
friend
advice
came
home
to
him
seaton
sat
down
and
pulled
out
his
pipe
there
was
a
tense
silence
for
an
instant
then
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
darted
into
his
room
returning
with
an
whose
needle
pointed
upward
duquesne
did
it
he
cried
exultantly
this
baby
is
still
looking
right
at
him
now
let
go
make
it
snappy
not
yet
we
should
find
out
how
far
away
they
are
that
may
give
us
an
idea
suiting
action
to
word
he
took
up
his
stopwatch
and
set
the
needle
swinging
they
watched
it
with
strained
faces
as
second
after
second
went
by
and
it
still
continued
to
swing
when
it
had
come
to
rest
crane
read
his
watch
and
made
a
rapid
calculation
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
million
miles
he
stated
clear
out
of
our
solar
system
already
and
from
the
distance
covered
he
must
have
had
a
constant
acceleration
so
as
to
approximate
the
velocity
of
light
and
he
is
still
going
with
full
but
nothing
can
possibly
go
that
fast
mart
it
impossible
how
about
einstein
theory
that
is
a
theory
this
measurement
of
distance
is
a
fact
as
you
know
from
our
tests
that
right
another
good
theory
gone
to
pot
but
how
do
you
account
for
his
distance
suppose
he
lost
control
he
must
have
i
do
not
believe
that
he
would
willingly
stand
that
acceleration
nor
that
he
would
have
gone
that
far
of
his
own
accord
do
you
i
sure
do
we
do
know
how
big
a
bar
they
are
carrying
so
we
ca
estimate
how
long
it
is
going
to
take
us
to
catch
them
but
not
waste
any
more
time
mart
for
cat
sake
let
get
busy
we
have
only
those
four
bars
dick
two
for
each
unit
do
you
think
that
will
be
enough
think
of
how
far
we
may
have
to
go
what
we
may
possibly
get
into
and
what
it
will
mean
to
dottie
if
we
fail
for
lack
of
power
seaton
though
furiously
eager
to
be
off
paused
at
this
new
idea
and
he
replied
we
are
so
far
behind
them
already
that
i
guess
a
few
hours
more
make
much
difference
it
sure
would
be
disastrous
to
get
out
near
one
of
the
fixed
stars
and
have
our
power
quit
i
guess
you
right
better
get
a
couple
more
make
it
four
then
we
have
enough
to
chase
them
half
our
lives
we
better
load
up
on
grub
and
ammunition
too
while
crane
and
shiro
carried
additional
provisions
and
boxes
of
cartridges
into
the
skylark
seaton
once
more
mounted
his
motorcycle
and
sped
across
the
city
to
the
brass
foundry
the
manager
of
the
plant
took
his
order
but
blandly
informed
him
that
there
was
not
that
much
copper
in
the
city
that
it
would
be
a
week
or
ten
days
before
the
order
could
be
filled
seaton
suggested
that
they
melt
up
some
copper
cable
and
other
goods
already
manufactured
offering
ten
times
their
value
but
the
manager
was
obdurate
saying
that
he
could
not
violate
the
rule
of
priority
of
orders
seaton
then
went
to
other
places
endeavoring
to
buy
scrap
copper
trolley
wire
electric
cable
anything
made
of
the
ruddy
metal
but
found
none
for
sale
in
quantities
large
enough
to
be
of
any
use
after
several
hours
of
fruitless
search
he
returned
home
in
a
towering
rage
and
explained
to
crane
in
lurid
language
his
failure
to
secure
the
copper
the
latter
was
unmoved
after
you
left
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
not
get
any
you
see
steel
is
still
watching
us
fire
shot
from
seaton
eyes
i
going
to
clean
up
that
bunch
he
gritted
through
his
teeth
as
he
started
straight
for
the
door
not
yet
dick
crane
remonstrated
we
can
go
down
to
wilson
in
a
few
minutes
and
i
know
we
can
get
it
there
if
he
has
it
the
skylark
is
all
ready
to
travel
no
more
words
were
needed
they
hurried
into
the
and
soon
were
standing
in
the
office
of
the
plant
in
which
the
vessel
had
been
built
when
they
had
made
their
wants
known
the
shook
his
head
i
sorry
crane
but
i
have
only
a
few
pounds
of
copper
in
the
shop
and
we
have
no
suitable
furnace
seaton
broke
out
violently
at
this
but
crane
interrupted
him
explaining
their
inability
to
get
the
metal
anywhere
else
and
the
urgency
of
their
need
when
he
had
finished
wilson
brought
his
fist
down
upon
his
desk
i
get
it
if
i
have
to
melt
up
our
dynamos
he
roared
we
have
to
rig
a
crucible
but
we
have
your
bars
out
just
as
soon
as
the
whole
force
of
this
damned
can
make
calling
in
his
foreman
he
bellowed
orders
and
while
automobiles
scoured
the
nearby
towns
for
scrap
copper
the
crucible
and
molds
were
made
ready
nearly
two
days
passed
before
the
gleaming
copper
cylinders
were
finished
during
this
time
crane
added
to
their
already
complete
equipment
every
article
he
could
conceive
of
their
having
any
use
for
while
seaton
raged
up
and
down
the
plant
in
a
black
fury
of
impatience
just
before
the
bars
were
ready
they
made
another
reading
on
the
their
faces
grew
tense
and
drawn
and
their
hearts
turned
sick
as
second
followed
second
and
minute
followed
minute
and
the
needle
still
oscillated
finally
however
it
came
to
rest
and
seaton
voice
almost
failed
him
as
he
read
his
figures
two
hundred
and
mart
they
lost
and
still
going
old
scout
holding
out
his
hand
tell
vaneman
that
i
bring
her
back
or
else
stay
out
there
myself
you
must
be
crazy
dick
you
know
i
am
going
why
no
use
in
both
of
us
taking
such
a
chance
if
dottie
gone
of
course
i
want
to
go
too
but
you
do
nonsense
dick
of
course
this
is
somewhat
farther
than
we
had
planned
on
going
for
our
maiden
voyage
but
where
is
the
difference
it
is
just
as
safe
to
go
a
thousand
as
only
one
and
we
have
power
and
food
for
any
contingency
there
is
no
more
danger
in
this
trip
than
there
is
in
one
to
mars
at
all
events
i
am
going
whether
you
want
me
to
or
not
so
save
your
breath
you
lie
like
a
thief
mart
you
know
what
we
are
up
against
as
well
as
i
do
but
if
you
insist
on
coming
along
i
sure
glad
to
have
you
as
their
hands
met
in
a
crushing
grip
the
bars
were
brought
up
and
loaded
into
the
carriers
waving
to
wilson
they
closed
the
massive
door
and
took
their
positions
seaton
adjusted
the
bar
parallel
with
the
needle
of
the
turned
on
the
coil
and
advanced
the
until
crane
reading
the
warned
him
to
slow
down
as
the
shell
was
heating
free
of
the
earth
atmosphere
he
slowly
advanced
the
lever
one
notch
at
a
time
until
he
could
no
longer
support
the
increasing
weight
of
his
hand
but
had
to
draw
out
the
rolling
support
designed
for
that
emergency
he
pushed
the
lever
a
few
notches
farther
and
felt
himself
forced
down
violently
into
the
seat
he
was
now
lying
at
full
length
the
seat
having
automatically
moved
upward
so
that
his
hand
still
controlled
the
lever
still
he
kept
putting
on
more
power
until
the
indicator
showed
that
more
than
of
the
power
was
in
operation
and
he
felt
that
he
could
stand
but
little
more
how
are
you
making
it
mart
he
asked
talking
with
difficulty
because
of
the
great
weight
of
his
tongue
and
jaws
all
right
so
far
came
the
response
in
a
hesitating
almost
stammering
voice
but
i
do
not
know
how
much
more
i
can
take
if
you
can
stand
it
go
ahead
this
is
enough
for
awhile
until
we
get
used
to
it
any
time
you
want
to
rest
tell
me
and
i
cut
her
down
keep
her
at
this
for
four
or
five
hours
then
cut
down
until
we
can
walk
so
that
we
can
eat
and
take
another
reading
on
distance
remember
that
it
will
take
as
long
to
stop
as
it
does
to
get
up
speed
and
that
we
must
be
careful
not
to
ram
them
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
either
car
all
right
talking
too
darn
much
work
i
talk
to
you
again
when
we
ease
down
i
sure
am
glad
we
on
our
way
at
last
chapter
ix
lost
in
space
for
hours
the
uncontrolled
atomic
motor
dragged
the
masterless
vessel
with
its
four
unconscious
passengers
through
the
illimitable
reaches
of
empty
space
with
an
awful
and
constantly
increasing
velocity
when
only
a
few
traces
of
copper
remained
in
the
the
acceleration
began
to
decrease
and
the
powerful
springs
began
to
restore
the
floor
and
the
seats
to
their
normal
positions
the
last
particle
of
copper
having
been
transformed
into
energy
the
speed
of
the
vessel
became
constant
apparently
motionless
to
those
inside
it
it
was
in
reality
traversing
space
with
a
velocity
thousands
of
times
greater
than
that
of
light
as
the
force
which
had
been
holding
them
down
was
relaxed
the
lungs
which
had
been
able
to
secure
only
air
enough
to
maintain
faint
sparks
of
life
began
to
function
more
normally
and
soon
all
four
recovered
consciousness
drinking
in
the
oxygen
in
a
rapid
succession
of
breaths
so
deep
that
it
seemed
as
though
their
lungs
must
burst
with
each
inhalation
duquesne
was
the
first
to
gain
control
of
himself
his
first
effort
to
rise
to
his
feet
lifted
him
from
the
floor
and
he
floated
lightly
to
the
ceiling
striking
it
with
a
gentle
bump
and
remaining
suspended
in
the
air
the
others
who
had
not
yet
attempted
to
move
stared
at
him
in
amazement
reaching
out
and
clutching
one
of
the
supporting
columns
he
drew
himself
back
to
the
floor
and
cautiously
removed
his
leather
suit
transferring
two
heavy
automatic
pistols
as
he
did
so
by
gingerly
feeling
of
his
injured
body
he
discovered
that
no
bones
were
broken
although
he
was
terribly
bruised
he
then
glanced
around
to
learn
how
his
companions
were
faring
he
saw
that
they
were
all
sitting
up
the
girls
resting
perkins
removing
his
aviator
costume
good
morning
doctor
duquesne
what
happened
when
i
kicked
your
friend
duquesne
smiled
good
morning
miss
vaneman
several
things
happened
he
fell
into
the
controls
turning
on
all
the
juice
we
left
shortly
afterward
i
tried
to
shut
the
power
off
and
in
doing
so
i
balled
things
up
worse
than
ever
then
i
went
to
sleep
and
just
woke
up
have
you
any
idea
where
we
are
no
but
i
can
make
a
fair
estimate
i
think
and
glancing
at
the
empty
chamber
in
which
the
bar
had
been
he
took
out
his
notebook
and
pen
and
figured
for
a
few
minutes
as
he
finished
he
drew
himself
along
by
a
handrail
to
one
of
the
windows
then
to
another
he
returned
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
and
made
a
long
calculation
i
do
know
exactly
what
to
make
of
this
he
said
thoughtfully
we
are
so
far
away
from
the
earth
that
even
the
fixed
stars
are
unrecognizable
the
power
was
on
exactly
hours
since
that
is
the
life
of
that
particular
bar
under
full
current
we
should
still
be
close
to
our
own
solar
system
since
it
is
theoretically
impossible
to
develop
any
velocity
greater
than
that
of
light
but
in
fact
we
have
i
know
enough
about
astronomy
to
recognize
the
fixed
stars
from
any
point
within
a
or
so
of
the
sun
and
i
ca
see
a
single
familiar
star
i
never
could
see
how
mass
could
be
a
function
of
velocity
and
now
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
not
we
have
been
accelerating
for
hours
he
turned
to
dorothy
while
we
were
unconscious
miss
vaneman
we
had
probably
attained
a
velocity
of
something
like
seven
billion
four
hundred
thirteen
million
miles
per
second
and
that
is
the
approximate
speed
at
which
we
are
now
traveling
we
must
be
nearly
six
quadrillion
miles
and
that
is
a
space
of
several
hundred
away
from
our
solar
system
or
more
plainly
about
six
times
as
far
away
from
our
earth
as
the
north
star
is
we
could
see
our
sun
with
a
telescope
even
if
we
knew
which
way
to
look
for
it
at
this
paralyzing
news
dorothy
face
turned
white
and
margaret
spencer
quietly
fainted
in
her
seat
then
we
can
never
get
back
asked
dorothy
slowly
at
this
question
perkins
gave
way
and
his
thin
veneer
of
decency
disappeared
completely
you
got
us
into
this
whole
thing
he
screamed
as
he
leaped
at
dorothy
with
murderous
fury
gleaming
in
his
pale
eyes
and
his
fingers
curved
into
talons
instead
of
reaching
her
however
he
merely
sprawled
grotesquely
in
midair
and
duquesne
knocked
him
clear
across
the
vessel
with
one
powerful
blow
of
his
fist
get
back
there
you
cowardly
cur
he
said
evenly
even
though
we
are
a
long
way
from
home
try
to
remember
you
a
man
at
least
one
more
break
like
that
and
i
throw
you
out
of
the
boat
it
is
her
fault
that
we
are
out
here
but
our
own
the
blame
for
it
is
a
very
small
matter
anyway
the
thing
of
importance
is
to
get
back
as
soon
as
possible
but
how
can
we
get
back
asked
perkins
sullenly
from
the
corner
where
he
was
crouching
fear
in
every
feature
the
power
is
gone
the
controls
are
wrecked
and
we
are
hopelessly
lost
in
space
oh
i
would
say
returned
the
other
i
have
never
been
in
any
situation
yet
that
i
could
get
out
of
and
i
wo
be
convinced
until
i
am
dead
that
i
ca
get
out
of
this
one
we
have
two
extra
power
bars
we
can
fix
the
board
and
if
i
ca
navigate
us
back
close
enough
to
our
solar
system
to
find
it
i
am
more
of
a
dub
than
i
think
i
am
how
about
a
little
bite
to
eat
show
us
where
it
is
exclaimed
dorothy
now
that
you
mention
it
i
find
that
i
am
starved
to
death
duquesne
looked
at
her
keenly
i
admire
your
nerve
miss
vaneman
i
did
suppose
that
that
animal
over
there
would
show
such
a
wide
streak
of
yellow
but
i
was
rather
afraid
that
you
girls
might
go
to
pieces
i
scared
blue
of
course
dorothy
admitted
frankly
but
hysterics
wo
do
any
good
and
we
simply
get
back
certainly
we
must
and
we
will
stated
duquesne
calmly
if
you
like
you
might
find
something
for
us
to
eat
in
the
galley
there
while
i
see
what
i
can
do
with
this
board
that
i
wrecked
with
my
head
by
the
way
that
there
is
the
apartment
reserved
for
you
two
ladies
we
are
in
rather
cramped
quarters
but
i
think
you
will
find
everything
you
need
as
dorothy
drew
herself
along
the
handrail
toward
the
room
designated
accompanied
by
the
other
girl
who
though
conscious
had
paid
little
attention
to
anything
around
her
she
could
not
help
feeling
a
thrill
of
admiration
for
the
splendid
villain
who
had
abducted
her
calm
and
cool
always
master
of
himself
apparently
paying
no
attention
to
the
terrible
bruises
which
disfigured
half
his
face
and
doubtless
half
his
body
as
well
she
admitted
to
herself
that
it
was
only
his
example
which
had
enabled
her
to
maintain
her
in
their
present
plight
as
she
crawled
over
perkins
discarded
suit
she
remembered
that
he
had
not
taken
any
weapons
from
it
after
a
rapid
glance
around
to
assure
herself
that
she
was
not
being
watched
she
quickly
searched
the
coat
bringing
to
light
not
one
but
two
pistols
which
she
thrust
into
her
pocket
she
saw
with
relief
that
they
were
regulation
army
automatics
with
whose
use
she
was
familiar
from
much
target
practise
with
seaton
in
the
room
which
was
a
miniature
of
the
one
she
had
seen
on
the
skylark
the
girls
found
clothing
toilet
articles
and
everything
necessary
for
a
long
trip
as
they
were
setting
themselves
to
rights
dorothy
electing
to
stay
in
her
riding
suit
they
surveyed
each
other
frankly
and
each
was
reassured
by
what
she
saw
dorothy
saw
a
girl
of
of
her
own
stature
with
a
mass
of
heavy
wavy
black
hair
her
eyes
a
singularly
rich
and
deep
brown
contrasted
strangely
with
the
beautiful
ivory
of
her
skin
she
was
normally
a
beautiful
girl
thought
dorothy
but
her
beauty
was
marred
by
suffering
and
privation
her
naturally
slender
form
was
thin
her
face
was
haggard
and
worn
the
stranger
broke
the
silence
i
margaret
spencer
she
began
abruptly
former
secretary
to
his
royal
highness
brookings
of
steel
they
swindled
my
father
out
of
an
invention
worth
millions
and
he
died
i
got
the
job
to
see
if
i
could
get
enough
evidence
to
convict
them
and
i
had
quite
a
lot
when
they
caught
me
i
had
some
things
that
they
were
afraid
to
lose
and
i
had
them
so
well
hidden
that
they
could
find
them
so
they
kidnapped
me
to
make
me
give
them
back
they
have
dared
kill
me
so
far
for
fear
the
evidence
will
show
up
after
my
death
which
it
will
however
i
will
be
legally
dead
before
long
and
then
they
know
the
whole
thing
will
come
out
so
they
have
brought
me
out
here
to
make
me
talk
or
kill
me
talking
wo
do
me
any
good
now
though
and
i
believe
it
ever
would
have
they
would
have
killed
me
after
they
got
the
stuff
back
anyway
so
you
see
i
at
least
will
never
get
back
to
the
earth
alive
cheer
up
we
all
get
back
safely
no
we
wo
you
do
know
that
man
perkins
if
that
is
his
name
i
never
heard
him
called
any
real
name
before
he
is
simply
unspeakable
vile
hideous
everything
that
is
base
he
was
my
jailer
and
i
utterly
loathe
and
despise
him
he
is
mean
and
underhanded
and
tricky
he
reminds
me
of
a
slimy
poisonous
snake
he
will
kill
me
i
know
it
but
how
about
doctor
duquesne
surely
he
is
that
kind
of
man
he
would
let
him
i
never
met
him
before
but
from
what
i
heard
of
him
in
the
office
he
even
worse
than
perkins
but
in
an
entirely
different
way
nothing
small
or
mean
about
him
and
i
do
believe
he
would
go
out
of
his
way
to
hurt
anyone
as
perkins
would
but
he
is
absolutely
cold
and
hard
a
perfect
fiend
where
his
interests
are
concerned
nothing
under
the
sun
good
or
bad
that
he
wo
do
but
i
glad
that
perkins
had
me
instead
of
doctor
as
they
call
him
perkins
raises
such
a
bitter
personal
feeling
that
anybody
would
rather
die
than
give
up
to
him
in
anything
duquesne
however
would
have
tortured
me
impersonally
and
scientifically
cold
and
all
the
while
and
using
the
most
efficient
methods
and
i
am
sure
he
would
have
got
it
out
of
me
some
way
he
always
gets
what
he
goes
after
oh
come
miss
spencer
dorothy
interrupted
the
girl
you
too
hard
on
him
did
you
see
him
knock
perkins
down
when
he
came
after
me
well
maybe
he
has
a
few
gentlemanly
instincts
which
he
uses
when
he
does
lose
anything
by
it
more
likely
he
merely
intended
to
rebuke
him
for
a
useless
action
he
is
a
firm
pragmatist
anything
that
is
useful
is
all
right
anything
that
is
useless
is
a
crime
more
probably
yet
he
wants
you
left
alive
of
course
that
is
his
real
reason
he
went
to
the
trouble
of
kidnapping
you
so
naturally
he
wo
let
perkins
or
anybody
else
kill
you
until
he
is
through
with
you
otherwise
he
would
have
let
perkins
do
anything
he
wanted
to
with
you
without
lifting
a
finger
i
ca
quite
believe
that
dorothy
replied
though
a
cold
chill
struck
at
her
heart
as
she
remembered
the
inhuman
crime
attributed
to
this
man
and
she
quailed
at
the
thought
of
being
in
his
charge
countless
millions
of
miles
from
earth
a
thought
only
partly
counteracted
by
the
fact
that
she
was
now
armed
he
has
treated
us
with
every
consideration
so
far
let
hope
for
the
best
anyway
i
sure
that
we
get
back
safely
why
so
sure
have
you
something
up
your
sleeve
no
or
yes
in
a
way
i
have
though
nothing
very
definite
i
dorothy
vaneman
and
i
am
engaged
to
the
man
who
discovered
the
thing
that
makes
this
go
that
why
they
kidnapped
you
then
to
make
him
give
up
all
his
rights
to
it
it
like
them
yes
i
think
that
why
they
did
it
but
they
wo
keep
me
long
dick
seaton
will
find
me
i
know
i
feel
it
but
that
exactly
what
they
want
cried
margaret
excitedly
in
my
spying
around
i
heard
a
little
about
this
very
thing
the
name
seaton
brings
it
to
my
mind
his
car
is
broken
in
some
way
so
that
it
will
kill
him
the
first
time
he
tries
to
run
it
that
where
they
underestimated
dick
and
his
partner
you
have
heard
of
martin
crane
of
course
i
think
i
heard
his
name
mentioned
in
the
office
together
with
seaton
but
that
all
well
besides
other
things
martin
is
quite
a
wonderful
mechanic
and
he
found
out
that
our
skylark
was
spoiled
so
they
built
another
one
a
lot
bigger
and
i
am
sure
that
they
are
following
us
right
now
but
how
can
they
possibly
follow
us
when
we
are
going
so
fast
and
are
so
far
away
queried
the
other
girl
once
more
despondent
i
do
quite
know
but
i
do
know
that
dick
will
find
a
way
simply
wonderful
he
knows
more
now
than
that
doctor
duquesne
will
ever
learn
in
all
his
life
and
he
will
find
us
in
a
few
days
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
besides
i
picked
perkins
pockets
of
these
two
pistols
can
you
shoot
an
automatic
yes
replied
the
other
girl
as
she
seized
one
of
the
guns
assured
herself
that
its
magazine
was
full
and
slipped
it
into
her
pocket
i
used
to
practise
a
lot
with
my
father
this
makes
me
feel
a
whole
lot
better
and
call
me
peggy
wo
you
it
will
seem
good
to
hear
my
name
again
after
what
i
been
through
lately
even
this
trip
will
be
a
vacation
for
me
well
then
cheer
up
peggy
dear
we
going
to
be
great
friends
let
go
get
us
all
something
to
eat
i
simply
starved
and
i
know
you
are
too
the
presence
of
the
pistol
in
her
pocket
and
dorothy
unwavering
faith
in
her
lover
lifted
the
stranger
out
of
the
mood
of
despair
into
which
the
long
imprisonment
the
brutal
treatment
and
the
present
situation
had
plunged
her
and
she
was
almost
cheerful
as
they
drew
themselves
along
the
leading
to
the
tiny
galley
i
simply
ca
get
used
to
the
idea
of
nothing
having
any
weight
look
here
laughed
dorothy
as
she
took
a
boiled
ham
out
of
the
refrigerator
and
hung
it
upon
an
imaginary
hook
in
the
air
where
it
remained
motionless
does
it
make
you
feel
funny
it
is
a
queer
sensation
i
feel
light
like
a
toy
balloon
and
i
feel
awfully
weird
inside
if
we
have
no
weight
why
does
it
hurt
so
when
we
bump
into
anything
and
when
you
throw
anything
like
the
doctor
did
perkins
why
does
it
hit
as
hard
as
ever
it
mass
or
inertia
or
something
like
that
a
thing
has
it
everywhere
whether
it
weighs
anything
or
not
dick
explained
it
all
to
me
i
understood
it
when
he
told
me
about
it
but
i
afraid
it
did
sink
in
very
deep
did
you
ever
study
physics
i
had
a
year
of
it
in
college
but
it
was
more
or
less
of
a
joke
i
went
to
a
girls
school
and
all
we
had
to
do
in
physics
was
to
get
the
credit
we
did
have
to
learn
it
me
too
next
time
i
go
to
school
i
going
to
yale
or
harvard
or
some
such
place
and
i
learn
so
much
mathematics
and
science
that
have
to
wear
a
bandeau
to
keep
my
massive
intellect
in
place
during
this
conversation
they
had
prepared
a
substantial
luncheon
and
had
arranged
it
daintily
upon
two
large
trays
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
caused
by
the
fact
that
nothing
would
remain
in
place
by
its
own
weight
the
feast
prepared
dorothy
took
her
tray
from
the
table
as
carefully
as
she
could
and
saw
the
sandwiches
and
bottles
start
to
float
toward
the
ceiling
hastily
inverting
the
tray
above
the
escaping
viands
she
pushed
them
back
down
upon
the
table
in
doing
so
she
lifted
herself
clear
from
the
floor
as
she
had
forgotten
to
hold
herself
down
what
we
do
anyway
she
wailed
when
she
had
recovered
her
position
everything
wants
to
fly
all
over
the
place
put
another
tray
on
top
of
it
and
hold
them
together
suggested
margaret
i
wish
we
had
a
birdcage
then
we
could
open
the
door
and
grab
a
sandwich
as
it
flies
out
by
covering
the
trays
the
girls
finally
carried
the
luncheon
out
into
the
main
compartment
where
they
gave
duquesne
and
perkins
one
of
the
trays
and
all
fell
to
eating
hungrily
duquesne
paused
with
a
glint
of
amusement
in
his
one
sound
eye
as
he
saw
dorothy
trying
to
pour
ginger
ale
out
of
a
bottle
it
ca
be
done
miss
vaneman
you
have
to
drink
it
through
a
straw
that
will
work
since
our
air
pressure
is
normal
be
careful
not
to
choke
on
it
though
your
swallowing
will
have
to
be
all
muscular
out
here
gravity
wo
help
you
or
wait
a
bit
i
have
the
control
board
fixed
and
it
will
be
a
matter
of
only
a
few
minutes
to
put
in
another
bar
and
get
enough
acceleration
to
take
the
place
of
gravity
he
placed
one
of
the
extra
power
bars
in
the
chamber
and
pushed
the
speed
lever
into
the
first
notch
and
there
was
a
lurch
of
the
whole
vessel
as
it
swung
around
the
bar
so
that
the
floor
was
once
more
perpendicular
to
it
he
took
a
couple
of
steps
returned
and
advanced
the
lever
another
notch
there
that
about
the
same
as
gravity
now
we
can
act
like
human
beings
and
eat
in
comfort
that
a
wonderful
relief
doctor
cried
dorothy
are
we
going
back
toward
the
earth
not
yet
i
reversed
the
bar
but
we
will
have
to
use
up
all
of
this
one
before
we
can
even
start
back
until
this
bar
is
gone
we
will
merely
be
slowing
down
as
the
meal
progressed
dorothy
noticed
that
duquesne
left
arm
seemed
almost
helpless
and
that
he
ate
with
great
difficulty
because
of
his
terribly
bruised
face
as
soon
as
they
had
removed
the
trays
she
went
into
her
room
where
she
had
seen
a
small
medicine
chest
and
brought
out
a
couple
of
bottles
lie
down
here
doctor
duquesne
she
commanded
i
going
to
apply
a
little
to
the
injured
arnica
and
iodine
are
all
i
can
find
but
they
help
a
little
i
all
right
began
the
scientist
but
at
her
imperious
gesture
he
submitted
and
she
bathed
his
battered
features
with
the
healing
lotion
and
painted
the
worst
bruises
with
iodine
i
see
your
arm
is
lame
where
does
it
hurt
shoulder
the
worst
i
rammed
it
through
the
board
when
we
started
out
he
opened
his
shirt
at
the
throat
and
bared
his
shoulder
and
dorothy
gasped
as
much
at
the
size
and
power
of
the
muscles
displayed
as
at
the
extent
and
severity
of
the
man
injuries
stepping
into
the
gallery
she
brought
out
hot
water
and
towels
and
gently
bathed
away
the
clotted
blood
that
had
been
forced
through
the
skin
massage
it
a
little
with
the
arnica
as
i
move
the
arm
he
directed
coolly
and
she
did
so
pityingly
he
did
not
wince
and
made
no
sign
of
pain
but
she
saw
beads
of
perspiration
appear
upon
his
face
and
wondered
at
his
fortitude
that
fine
he
said
gratefully
as
she
finished
and
a
peculiar
expression
came
over
his
face
it
feels
one
hundred
per
cent
better
already
but
why
do
you
do
it
i
should
think
you
would
feel
like
crowning
me
with
that
basin
instead
of
playing
nurse
efficiency
she
replied
with
a
smile
i
taking
a
leaf
out
of
your
own
book
you
are
our
chief
engineer
you
know
and
it
wo
do
to
have
you
laid
up
that
a
logical
explanation
but
it
does
go
far
enough
he
rejoined
still
studying
her
intently
she
did
not
reply
but
turned
to
perkins
how
are
you
perkins
do
you
require
medical
attention
no
growled
perkins
from
the
seat
in
which
he
had
crouched
immediately
after
eating
keep
away
from
me
or
i
cut
your
heart
out
shut
up
snapped
duquesne
remember
what
i
said
i
have
done
anything
snarled
the
other
i
said
i
would
throw
you
out
if
you
made
another
break
duquesne
informed
him
evenly
and
i
meant
it
if
you
ca
talk
decently
keep
still
understand
that
you
are
to
keep
off
miss
vaneman
words
and
actions
i
am
in
charge
of
her
and
i
will
put
up
with
no
interference
whatever
this
is
your
last
warning
how
about
spencer
then
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
her
she
not
mine
responded
duquesne
with
a
shrug
an
evil
light
appeared
in
perkins
eyes
and
he
took
out
a
knife
and
began
to
strop
it
carefully
upon
the
leather
of
the
seat
glaring
at
his
victim
the
while
well
have
something
to
say
blazed
dorothy
but
she
was
silenced
by
a
gesture
from
margaret
who
calmly
took
the
pistol
from
her
pocket
jerked
the
slide
back
throwing
a
cartridge
into
the
chamber
and
held
the
weapon
up
on
one
finger
admiring
it
from
all
sides
do
worry
about
his
knife
he
has
been
sharpening
it
for
my
benefit
for
the
last
month
he
does
mean
anything
by
it
at
this
unexpected
show
of
resistance
perkins
stared
at
her
for
an
instant
then
glanced
at
his
coat
yes
this
was
yours
once
you
need
bother
about
picking
up
your
coat
they
both
gone
you
might
be
tempted
to
throw
that
knife
so
drop
it
on
the
floor
and
kick
it
over
to
me
before
i
count
three
one
the
heavy
pistol
steadied
into
line
with
his
chest
and
her
finger
tightened
on
the
trigger
two
he
obeyed
and
she
picked
up
the
knife
he
turned
to
duquesne
who
had
watched
the
scene
unmoved
a
faint
smile
upon
his
saturnine
face
doctor
he
cried
shaking
with
fear
why
do
you
shoot
her
or
take
that
gun
away
from
her
surely
you
do
want
to
see
me
murdered
why
not
replied
duquesne
calmly
it
is
nothing
to
me
whether
she
kills
you
or
you
kill
her
you
brought
it
on
yourself
by
your
own
carelessness
any
man
with
brains
does
leave
guns
lying
around
within
reach
of
prisoners
and
a
blind
man
could
have
seen
miss
vaneman
getting
your
hardware
you
saw
her
take
them
and
did
warn
me
croaked
perkins
why
should
i
warn
you
if
you
ca
take
care
of
your
own
prisoner
she
earns
her
liberty
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
never
did
like
your
style
perkins
especially
your
methods
of
handling
or
rather
mishandling
women
you
could
have
made
her
give
up
the
stuff
she
recovered
from
that
ass
brookings
inside
of
an
hour
and
would
have
had
to
kill
her
afterward
either
how
sneered
the
other
if
you
are
so
good
at
that
kind
of
thing
why
did
you
try
it
on
seaton
and
crane
there
are
seven
different
methods
to
use
on
a
woman
like
miss
spencer
each
of
which
will
produce
the
desired
result
the
reason
i
did
not
try
them
on
either
seaton
or
crane
is
that
they
would
have
failed
your
method
of
indirect
action
is
probably
the
only
one
that
will
succeed
that
is
why
i
adopted
it
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
shrieked
perkins
are
you
going
to
sit
there
and
lecture
all
day
i
am
going
to
do
nothing
whatever
answered
the
scientist
coldly
if
you
had
any
brains
you
would
see
that
you
are
in
no
danger
miss
spencer
will
undoubtedly
kill
you
if
you
attack
her
not
otherwise
that
is
an
weakness
did
you
see
me
take
the
pistols
queried
dorothy
certainly
i
not
blind
you
have
one
of
them
in
your
right
coat
pocket
now
then
why
did
you
or
do
you
try
to
take
it
away
from
me
she
asked
in
wonder
if
i
had
objected
to
your
having
them
you
would
never
have
got
them
if
i
did
want
you
to
have
a
gun
now
i
would
take
it
away
from
you
you
know
that
do
you
and
his
black
eyes
stared
into
her
violet
ones
with
such
calm
certainty
of
his
ability
that
she
felt
her
heart
sink
yes
she
admitted
finally
i
believe
you
could
that
is
unless
i
were
angry
enough
to
shoot
you
that
would
help
you
i
can
shoot
faster
and
straighter
than
you
can
and
would
shoot
it
out
of
your
hand
however
i
have
no
objection
to
your
having
the
gun
since
it
is
no
part
of
my
plan
to
offer
you
any
further
indignity
of
any
kind
even
if
you
had
the
necessary
coldness
of
nerve
or
cruelty
of
disposition
of
which
i
have
one
perkins
the
other
and
you
neither
you
would
shoot
me
now
because
you
ca
get
back
to
the
earth
without
me
after
we
get
back
i
will
take
the
guns
away
from
both
of
you
if
i
think
it
desirable
in
the
meantime
play
with
them
all
you
please
has
perkins
any
more
knives
or
guns
or
things
in
his
room
demanded
dorothy
how
should
i
know
indifferently
then
as
both
girls
started
for
perkins
room
he
ordered
brusquely
sit
down
miss
vaneman
let
them
fight
it
out
perkins
has
his
orders
to
lay
off
you
you
lay
off
him
i
not
taking
any
chances
of
getting
you
hurt
that
one
reason
i
wanted
you
armed
if
he
gets
gay
shoot
him
otherwise
hands
off
completely
dorothy
threw
up
her
head
in
defiance
but
meeting
his
cold
stare
she
paused
irresolutely
and
finally
sat
down
biting
her
lips
in
anger
while
the
other
girl
went
on
that
better
she
does
need
any
help
to
whip
that
yellow
dog
whipped
already
he
never
would
think
of
fighting
unless
the
odds
were
three
to
one
in
his
favor
when
margaret
had
returned
from
a
fruitless
search
of
perkins
room
and
had
assured
herself
that
he
had
no
more
weapons
concealed
about
his
person
she
thrust
the
pistol
back
into
her
pocket
and
sat
down
that
ends
that
she
declared
i
guess
you
will
be
good
now
you
mr
perkins
yes
that
worthy
muttered
i
have
to
be
now
that
you
got
the
drop
on
me
and
duquesne
gone
back
on
me
but
wait
until
we
get
back
get
you
then
you
stop
right
there
sharply
there
nothing
i
would
rather
do
than
shoot
you
right
now
if
you
give
me
the
slightest
excuse
such
as
that
name
you
were
about
to
call
me
now
go
ahead
duquesne
broke
the
silence
that
followed
well
now
that
the
battle
is
over
and
since
we
are
fed
and
rested
i
suggest
that
we
slow
down
a
bit
and
get
ready
to
start
back
pick
out
comfortable
seats
everybody
and
i
shoot
a
little
more
juice
through
that
bar
seating
himself
before
the
instrument
board
he
advanced
the
speed
lever
slowly
until
nearly
of
the
full
power
was
on
as
much
as
he
thought
the
others
could
stand
for
sixty
hours
he
drove
the
car
reducing
the
acceleration
only
at
intervals
during
which
they
ate
and
walked
about
their
narrow
quarters
in
order
to
restore
the
blood
to
circulation
in
their
suffering
bodies
the
power
was
not
reduced
for
sleep
everyone
slept
as
best
he
could
dorothy
and
margaret
talked
together
at
every
opportunity
and
a
real
intimacy
grew
up
between
them
perkins
was
for
the
most
part
sullenly
quiet
knowing
himself
despised
by
all
the
others
and
having
no
outlet
here
for
his
particular
brand
of
cleverness
duquesne
was
always
occupied
with
his
work
and
only
occasionally
addressed
a
remark
to
one
or
another
of
the
party
except
during
meals
at
those
periods
of
general
recuperation
he
talked
easily
and
well
upon
many
topics
there
was
no
animosity
in
his
bearing
nor
did
he
seem
to
perceive
any
directed
toward
himself
but
when
any
of
the
others
ventured
to
infringe
upon
his
ideas
of
how
discipline
should
be
maintained
duquesne
reproof
was
merciless
dorothy
almost
liked
him
but
margaret
insisted
that
she
considered
him
worse
than
ever
when
the
bar
was
exhausted
duquesne
lifted
the
sole
remaining
cylinder
into
place
we
should
be
nearly
stationary
with
respect
to
the
earth
he
remarked
now
we
will
start
back
why
it
felt
as
though
we
were
picking
up
speed
for
the
last
three
days
exclaimed
margaret
yes
it
feels
that
way
because
we
have
nothing
to
judge
by
slowing
down
in
one
direction
feels
exactly
like
starting
up
in
the
opposite
one
there
is
no
means
of
knowing
whether
we
are
standing
still
going
away
from
the
earth
or
going
toward
it
since
we
have
nothing
stationary
upon
which
to
make
observations
however
since
the
two
bars
were
of
exactly
the
same
size
and
were
exerted
in
opposite
directions
except
for
a
few
minutes
after
we
left
the
earth
we
are
nearly
stationary
now
i
will
put
on
power
until
this
bar
is
something
less
than
half
gone
then
coast
for
three
or
four
days
by
the
end
of
that
time
we
should
be
able
to
recognize
our
solar
system
from
the
appearance
of
the
fixed
stars
he
again
advanced
the
lever
and
for
many
hours
silence
filled
the
car
as
it
hurtled
through
space
duquesne
waking
up
from
a
long
nap
saw
that
the
bar
no
longer
pointed
directly
toward
the
top
of
the
ship
perpendicular
to
the
floor
but
was
inclined
at
a
sharp
angle
he
reduced
the
current
and
felt
the
lurch
of
the
car
as
it
swung
around
the
bar
increasing
the
angle
many
degrees
he
measured
the
angle
carefully
and
peered
out
of
all
the
windows
on
one
side
of
the
car
returning
to
the
bar
after
a
time
he
again
measured
the
angle
and
found
that
it
had
increased
greatly
what
the
matter
doctor
duquesne
asked
dorothy
who
had
also
been
asleep
we
are
being
deflected
from
our
course
you
see
the
bar
does
point
straight
up
any
more
of
course
the
direction
of
the
bar
has
changed
the
car
has
swung
around
it
what
does
that
mean
we
have
come
close
enough
to
some
star
so
that
its
attraction
swings
the
bottom
of
the
car
around
normally
you
know
the
bottom
of
the
car
follows
directly
behind
the
bar
it
does
mean
much
yet
except
that
we
are
being
drawn
away
from
our
straight
line
but
if
the
attraction
gets
much
stronger
it
may
make
us
miss
our
solar
system
completely
i
have
been
looking
for
the
star
in
question
but
ca
see
it
yet
probably
pull
away
from
it
very
shortly
he
threw
on
the
power
and
for
some
time
watched
the
bar
anxiously
expecting
to
see
it
swing
back
into
the
vertical
but
the
angle
continually
increased
he
again
reduced
the
current
and
searched
the
heavens
for
the
troublesome
body
do
you
see
it
yet
asked
dorothy
with
concern
no
there
apparently
nothing
near
enough
to
account
for
all
this
deflection
he
took
out
a
pair
of
large
and
peered
through
them
for
several
minutes
good
god
it
a
dead
sun
and
we
nearly
onto
it
it
looks
as
large
as
our
moon
springing
to
the
board
he
whirled
the
bar
into
the
vertical
he
took
down
a
strange
instrument
went
to
the
bottom
window
and
measured
the
apparent
size
of
the
dark
star
then
after
cautioning
the
rest
of
the
party
to
sit
tight
he
advanced
the
lever
farther
than
it
had
been
before
after
half
an
hour
he
again
slackened
the
pace
and
made
another
observation
finding
to
his
astonishment
that
the
dark
mass
had
almost
doubled
its
apparent
size
dorothy
noting
his
expression
was
about
to
speak
but
he
forestalled
her
we
lost
ground
instead
of
gaining
that
spurt
he
remarked
as
he
hastened
to
his
post
it
must
be
inconceivably
large
to
exert
such
an
enormous
attractive
force
at
this
distance
we
have
to
put
on
full
power
hang
onto
yourselves
as
best
you
can
he
then
pushed
the
lever
out
to
its
last
notch
and
left
it
there
until
the
bar
was
nearly
gone
only
to
find
that
the
faint
disk
of
the
monster
globe
was
even
larger
than
before
being
now
visible
to
the
unaided
eye
revived
the
three
others
saw
it
plainly
a
great
dim
circle
visible
as
is
the
dark
portion
of
the
new
moon
and
the
power
shut
off
they
felt
themselves
falling
toward
it
with
sickening
speed
perkins
screamed
with
mad
fear
and
flung
himself
grovelling
upon
the
floor
margaret
her
nerves
still
unstrung
clutched
at
her
heart
with
both
hands
dorothy
though
her
eyes
looked
like
great
black
holes
in
her
white
face
looked
duquesne
in
the
eye
steadily
this
is
the
end
then
not
yet
he
replied
in
a
calm
and
level
voice
the
end
will
not
come
for
a
good
many
hours
as
i
have
calculated
that
it
will
take
at
least
two
days
probably
more
to
fall
the
distance
we
have
to
go
we
have
all
that
time
in
which
to
think
out
a
way
of
escape
wo
the
outer
repulsive
shell
keep
us
from
striking
it
or
at
least
break
the
force
of
our
fall
no
it
was
designed
only
as
protection
from
meteorites
and
other
small
bodies
it
is
heavy
enough
to
swing
us
away
from
a
small
planet
but
it
will
be
used
up
long
before
we
strike
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
sat
at
case
as
though
in
his
own
study
his
brow
wrinkled
in
thought
as
he
made
calculations
in
his
notebook
finally
he
rose
to
his
feet
there
only
one
chance
that
i
can
see
that
is
to
gather
up
every
scrap
of
copper
we
have
and
try
to
pull
ourselves
far
enough
out
of
line
so
that
we
will
take
an
hyperbolic
orbit
around
that
body
instead
of
falling
into
it
what
good
will
that
do
us
asked
margaret
striving
for
we
will
starve
to
death
finally
wo
we
not
necessarily
that
will
give
us
time
to
figure
out
something
else
you
wo
have
to
figure
out
anything
else
doctor
stated
dorothy
positively
if
we
miss
that
moon
dick
and
martin
will
find
us
before
very
long
not
in
this
life
if
they
tried
to
follow
us
they
both
dead
before
now
that
where
even
you
are
wrong
she
flashed
at
him
they
knew
you
were
wrecking
our
machine
so
they
built
another
one
a
good
one
and
they
know
a
lot
of
things
about
this
new
metal
that
you
have
never
dreamed
of
since
they
were
not
in
the
plans
you
stole
duquesne
went
directly
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
paying
no
attention
to
her
barbed
shafts
can
they
follow
us
through
space
without
seeing
us
he
demanded
yes
or
at
least
i
think
they
can
how
do
they
do
it
i
do
know
i
would
tell
you
if
i
did
you
tell
if
you
know
he
declared
his
voice
cutting
like
a
knife
but
that
can
wait
until
after
we
get
out
of
this
the
thing
to
do
now
is
to
dodge
that
world
he
searched
the
vessel
for
copper
ruthlessly
tearing
out
almost
everything
that
contained
the
metal
hammering
it
flat
and
throwing
it
into
the
he
set
the
bar
at
right
angles
to
the
line
of
their
fall
and
turned
on
the
current
when
the
metal
was
exhausted
he
made
another
series
of
observations
upon
the
body
toward
which
they
were
falling
and
reported
quietly
we
made
a
lot
of
distance
but
not
enough
everything
goes
in
this
time
he
tore
out
the
single
remaining
leaving
the
car
in
darkness
save
for
the
diffused
light
of
his
electric
torch
and
broke
up
the
only
remaining
motor
he
then
took
his
almost
priceless
swiss
watch
his
heavy
signet
ring
his
scarf
pin
and
the
cartridges
from
his
pistol
and
added
them
to
the
collection
flashing
his
lamp
upon
perkins
he
relieved
him
of
everything
he
had
which
contained
copper
i
think
i
have
a
few
pennies
in
my
pocketbook
suggested
dorothy
get
he
directed
briefly
and
while
she
was
gone
he
searched
margaret
without
result
save
for
the
cartridges
in
her
pistol
as
she
had
no
jewelry
remaining
after
her
imprisonment
dorothy
returned
and
handed
him
everything
she
had
found
i
would
like
to
keep
this
ring
she
said
slowly
pointing
to
a
slender
circlet
of
gold
set
with
a
solitaire
diamond
if
you
think
there
is
any
chance
of
us
getting
clear
everything
goes
that
has
any
copper
in
it
he
said
coldly
and
i
am
glad
to
see
that
seaton
is
too
good
a
chemist
to
buy
any
platinum
jewelry
you
may
keep
the
diamond
though
as
he
wrenched
the
jewel
out
of
its
setting
and
returned
it
to
her
he
threw
all
the
metal
into
the
central
chamber
and
the
vessel
gave
a
tremendous
lurch
as
the
power
was
again
applied
it
was
soon
spent
however
and
after
the
final
observation
the
others
waiting
in
breathless
suspense
for
him
to
finish
his
calculations
he
made
his
curt
announcement
not
enough
perkins
his
mind
weakened
by
the
strain
of
the
last
few
days
went
completely
insane
at
the
words
with
a
wild
howl
he
threw
himself
at
the
unmoved
scientist
who
struck
him
with
the
butt
of
his
pistol
as
he
leaped
the
mighty
force
of
duquesne
blow
crushing
his
skull
like
an
eggshell
and
throwing
him
backward
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
vessel
margaret
lay
in
her
seat
in
a
dead
faint
dorothy
and
duquesne
looked
at
each
other
in
the
feeble
light
of
the
torch
to
the
girl
amazement
the
man
was
as
calm
as
though
he
were
safe
in
his
own
house
and
she
made
a
determined
effort
to
hold
herself
together
what
next
doctor
duquesne
i
do
know
we
have
a
couple
of
days
yet
at
least
i
have
to
study
awhile
in
that
time
dick
will
find
us
i
know
even
if
they
do
find
us
in
time
which
i
doubt
what
good
will
it
do
it
simply
means
that
they
will
go
with
us
instead
of
saving
us
for
of
course
they
ca
pull
away
since
we
could
i
hope
they
do
find
us
but
locate
this
star
in
time
to
keep
away
from
it
why
she
gasped
you
have
been
planning
to
kill
both
of
them
i
should
think
you
would
be
delighted
to
take
them
with
us
far
from
it
please
try
to
be
logical
i
intended
to
remove
them
because
they
stood
in
the
way
of
my
developing
this
new
metal
if
i
am
to
be
out
of
the
way
and
frankly
i
see
very
little
chance
of
getting
out
of
this
i
hope
that
seaton
goes
ahead
with
it
it
is
the
greatest
discovery
the
world
has
ever
known
and
if
both
seaton
and
i
the
only
two
men
in
the
world
who
know
how
to
handle
it
drop
out
it
will
be
lost
for
perhaps
hundreds
of
years
if
dick
finding
us
means
that
he
must
go
too
of
course
i
hope
that
he
wo
find
us
but
i
do
believe
that
i
simply
know
that
he
could
get
us
away
from
here
she
continued
more
slowly
almost
speaking
to
herself
her
heart
sinking
with
her
voice
he
is
following
us
and
he
wo
stop
even
if
he
does
see
this
dead
star
and
knows
that
he
ca
get
away
we
will
die
together
there
no
denying
the
fact
that
our
situation
is
critical
but
you
know
a
man
is
dead
until
after
his
heart
stops
beating
we
have
two
whole
days
yet
and
in
that
time
i
can
probably
dope
out
some
way
of
getting
away
from
here
i
hope
so
she
replied
keeping
her
voice
from
breaking
only
by
a
great
effort
but
go
ahead
with
your
doping
i
worn
out
she
drew
herself
down
upon
one
of
the
seats
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
fighting
to
restrain
an
almost
overpowering
impulse
to
scream
thus
the
hours
wore
by
perkins
dead
margaret
still
unconscious
dorothy
lying
in
her
seat
her
thoughts
a
formless
prayer
buoyed
up
only
by
her
faith
in
god
and
in
her
lover
duquesne
smoking
innumerable
cigarettes
his
keen
mind
grappling
with
its
most
desperate
problem
grimly
fighting
until
the
very
last
instant
of
life
while
the
powerless
fell
with
an
appalling
velocity
faster
and
faster
falling
toward
that
cold
and
desolate
monster
of
the
heaven
chapter
x
the
rescue
seaton
and
crane
drove
the
skylark
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
unwavering
with
the
greatest
acceleration
they
could
stand
each
man
taking
a
watch
at
the
instrument
board
now
indeed
did
the
skylark
justify
the
faith
of
her
builders
and
the
two
inventors
with
an
exultant
certainty
of
their
success
flew
out
beyond
man
wildest
imaginings
had
it
not
been
for
the
haunting
fear
for
dorothy
safety
the
journey
would
have
been
one
of
pure
triumph
and
even
that
anxiety
did
not
prevent
a
profound
joy
in
the
enterprise
if
that
misguided
mutt
thinks
he
can
pull
off
a
stunt
like
that
and
get
away
with
it
he
got
another
think
coming
asserted
seaton
after
making
a
reading
on
the
other
car
after
several
days
of
the
flight
he
went
off
this
time
for
sure
and
we
got
him
foul
better
put
on
some
negative
pretty
soon
had
we
mart
only
a
little
over
a
hundred
now
crane
nodded
agreement
and
seaton
continued
it
take
as
long
to
stop
of
course
as
it
has
taken
to
get
out
here
and
if
we
ram
them
good
night
let
figure
it
out
as
nearly
as
we
can
they
calculated
their
own
speed
and
that
of
the
other
vessel
as
shown
by
the
various
readings
taken
and
applied
just
enough
negative
acceleration
to
slow
the
skylark
down
to
the
speed
of
the
other
when
they
should
come
up
with
it
they
smiled
at
each
other
in
recognition
of
the
perfect
working
of
the
mechanism
when
the
huge
vessel
had
spun
with
a
sickening
lurch
through
a
complete
the
instant
the
power
was
reversed
each
knew
that
they
were
actually
traveling
in
a
direction
that
to
them
seemed
down
but
with
a
constantly
diminishing
velocity
even
though
they
seemed
to
be
still
going
up
with
an
increasing
speed
until
nearly
the
end
of
the
calculated
time
the
two
took
turns
as
before
but
as
the
time
of
meeting
drew
near
both
men
were
on
the
alert
taking
readings
on
the
every
few
minutes
finally
crane
announced
we
are
almost
on
them
dick
they
are
so
close
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
time
the
needle
less
than
ten
thousand
miles
seaton
gradually
increased
the
retarding
force
until
the
needle
showed
that
they
were
very
close
to
the
other
vessel
and
maintaining
a
constant
distance
from
it
he
then
shut
off
the
power
and
both
men
hurried
to
the
bottom
window
to
search
for
the
fleeing
ship
with
their
powerful
they
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
as
they
felt
themselves
falling
almost
directly
downward
with
an
astounding
acceleration
what
do
you
make
of
it
dick
asked
crane
calmly
as
he
brought
his
glasses
to
his
eyes
and
stared
out
into
the
black
heavens
studded
with
multitudes
of
brilliant
and
unfamiliar
stars
i
do
make
it
at
all
mart
by
the
feel
i
should
say
we
were
falling
toward
something
that
would
make
our
earth
look
like
a
i
remember
now
that
i
noticed
that
the
bus
was
getting
a
little
out
of
plumb
with
the
bar
all
this
last
watch
i
did
pay
much
attention
to
it
as
i
could
see
anything
out
of
the
way
nothing
but
a
sun
could
be
big
enough
to
raise
all
this
disturbance
and
i
ca
see
any
close
enough
to
be
afraid
of
can
you
no
and
i
can
not
see
the
steel
either
look
sharp
of
course
seaton
continued
to
argue
as
he
peered
out
into
the
night
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
a
heavenly
body
can
exist
large
enough
so
that
it
could
exert
even
this
much
force
and
still
appear
no
larger
than
an
ordinary
star
but
i
do
believe
it
is
probable
give
me
three
or
four
minutes
of
visual
angle
and
i
believe
anything
but
none
of
these
stars
are
big
enough
to
have
any
visual
angle
at
all
furthermore
there
is
at
least
half
a
degree
of
visual
angle
broke
in
his
friend
intensely
just
to
the
left
of
that
constellation
that
looks
so
much
like
a
question
mark
it
is
not
bright
but
dark
like
a
very
dark
moon
barely
perceptible
seaton
pointed
his
glass
eagerly
in
the
direction
indicated
great
cat
he
ejaculated
i
say
that
some
moon
would
that
rattle
your
slats
and
there
duquesne
bus
too
on
the
right
edge
get
it
as
they
stood
up
seaton
mood
turned
to
one
of
deadly
earnestness
and
a
grave
look
came
over
crane
face
as
the
seriousness
of
their
situation
dawned
upon
them
trained
mathematicians
both
they
knew
instantly
that
that
unknown
world
was
of
inconceivable
mass
and
that
their
chance
of
escape
was
none
too
good
even
should
they
abandon
the
other
craft
to
its
fate
seaton
stared
at
crane
his
fists
clenched
and
drops
of
perspiration
standing
on
his
forehead
suddenly
with
agony
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
voice
he
spoke
mighty
slim
chance
of
getting
away
if
we
go
through
with
it
old
man
hate
like
the
devil
have
no
right
to
ask
you
to
throw
yourself
away
too
enough
of
that
dick
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
coming
you
could
not
have
kept
me
away
we
will
see
it
through
their
hands
met
in
a
fierce
clasp
broken
by
seaton
as
he
jumped
to
the
levers
with
an
intense
well
let
get
busy
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
reduced
the
distance
until
they
could
plainly
see
the
other
vessel
a
small
black
circle
against
the
faintly
luminous
disk
as
it
leaped
into
clear
relief
in
the
beam
of
his
powerful
searchlight
seaton
focused
the
great
attractor
upon
the
fugitive
car
and
threw
in
the
lever
which
released
the
full
force
of
that
mighty
magnet
while
crane
attracted
the
attention
of
the
vessel
occupants
by
means
of
a
momentary
burst
of
solid
bullets
which
he
knew
would
glance
harmlessly
off
the
steel
hull
after
an
interminable
silence
duquesne
drew
himself
out
of
his
seat
he
took
a
long
inhalation
deposited
the
butt
of
his
cigarette
carefully
in
his
ash
tray
and
made
his
way
to
his
room
he
returned
with
three
heavy
fur
suits
provided
with
air
helmets
two
of
which
he
handed
to
the
girls
who
were
huddled
in
a
seat
with
their
arms
around
each
other
these
suits
were
the
armor
designed
by
crane
for
use
in
exploring
the
vacuum
and
the
intense
cold
of
dead
worlds
braced
with
fine
steel
netting
and
supplied
with
air
at
normal
pressure
from
small
tanks
by
automatic
valves
they
made
their
wearers
independent
of
surrounding
conditions
of
pressure
and
temperature
the
next
thing
to
do
duquesne
stated
calmly
is
to
get
the
copper
off
the
outside
of
the
ship
that
is
the
last
resort
as
it
robs
us
of
our
only
safeguard
against
meteorites
but
this
is
the
time
for
measures
i
going
after
that
copper
put
these
suits
on
as
our
air
will
leave
as
soon
as
i
open
the
door
and
practically
an
absolute
vacuum
and
equally
absolute
zero
will
come
in
as
he
spoke
the
ship
was
enveloped
in
a
blinding
glare
and
they
were
thrown
flat
as
the
vessel
slowed
down
in
its
terrific
fall
the
thought
flashed
across
duquesne
mind
that
they
had
already
entered
the
atmosphere
of
that
monster
globe
and
were
being
slowed
down
and
set
afire
by
its
friction
but
he
dismissed
it
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
the
light
in
that
case
would
be
the
green
of
copper
not
this
his
next
thought
was
that
there
had
been
a
collision
of
meteors
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
their
retardation
was
due
to
the
outer
coating
while
these
thoughts
were
flickering
through
his
mind
they
heard
an
insistent
metallic
tapping
which
duquesne
recognized
instantly
a
he
blurted
in
amazement
how
in
it
dick
screamed
dorothy
with
flashing
eyes
he
found
us
just
as
i
knew
he
would
you
could
beat
dick
and
martin
in
a
thousand
years
the
tension
under
which
they
had
been
laboring
so
long
suddenly
released
the
two
girls
locked
their
arms
around
each
other
in
a
outburst
of
relief
margaret
meaningless
words
and
dorothy
incoherent
praises
of
her
lover
and
crane
mingled
with
their
racking
sobs
as
each
fought
to
recover
duquesne
had
instantly
mounted
to
the
upper
window
throwing
back
the
cover
he
flashed
his
torch
rapidly
the
glare
of
the
searchlight
was
snuffed
out
and
he
saw
a
flashing
light
spell
out
in
dots
and
dashes
can
you
read
morse
yes
he
signalled
back
power
gone
drifting
into
we
know
it
will
you
resist
no
have
you
fur
yes
put
them
on
shut
off
your
outer
coating
will
touch
so
your
upper
door
against
our
lower
open
transfer
quick
hastily
returning
to
the
main
compartment
he
briefly
informed
the
girls
as
to
what
had
happened
all
three
donned
the
suits
and
stationed
themselves
at
the
upper
opening
rapidly
but
with
unerring
precision
the
two
ships
were
brought
into
place
and
held
together
by
the
attractor
as
the
doors
were
opened
there
was
a
screaming
hiss
as
the
air
of
the
vessels
escaped
through
the
narrow
crack
between
them
the
passengers
saw
the
moisture
in
the
air
turn
into
snow
and
saw
the
air
itself
first
liquefy
and
then
freeze
into
a
solid
coating
upon
the
metal
around
the
orifices
at
the
touch
of
the
frightful
cold
outside
the
absolute
zero
of
interstellar
space
about
four
hundred
sixty
degrees
below
zero
in
the
scale
of
temperature
the
moisture
of
their
breath
condensed
upon
the
inside
of
the
double
glasses
of
their
helmets
rendering
sight
useless
illustration
duquesne
seized
her
and
tossed
her
lightly
through
the
doorway
in
such
a
manner
that
she
would
not
touch
the
metal
which
would
have
frozen
instantly
anything
coming
into
contact
with
it
dorothy
pushed
the
other
girl
ahead
of
her
duquesne
seized
her
and
tossed
her
lightly
through
the
doorway
in
such
a
manner
that
she
would
not
touch
the
metal
which
would
have
frozen
instantly
anything
coming
into
contact
with
it
seaton
was
waiting
feeling
a
woman
slender
form
in
his
arms
he
crushed
her
to
him
in
a
mighty
embrace
and
was
astonished
to
feel
movements
of
resistance
and
to
hear
a
strange
girlish
voice
cry
out
do
it
me
dorothy
next
releasing
her
abruptly
he
passed
her
on
to
martin
and
turned
just
in
time
to
catch
his
sweetheart
who
knowing
that
he
would
be
there
and
recognizing
his
powerful
arms
at
the
first
touch
returned
his
embrace
with
a
fierce
intensity
which
even
he
had
never
suspected
that
she
could
exert
they
stood
motionless
locked
in
each
other
arms
while
duquesne
dove
through
the
opening
and
snapped
the
door
shut
behind
him
the
and
temperature
back
to
normal
the
cumbersome
suits
were
hastily
removed
and
seaton
lips
met
dorothy
in
a
long
clinging
caress
duquesne
cold
incisive
voice
broke
the
silence
every
second
counts
i
would
suggest
that
we
go
somewhere
just
a
minute
snapped
crane
dick
what
shall
we
do
with
this
murderer
seaton
had
forgotten
duquesne
utterly
in
the
joy
of
holding
his
sweetheart
in
his
arms
but
at
his
friend
words
he
faced
about
and
his
face
grew
stern
by
rights
we
ought
to
chuck
him
back
into
his
own
tub
and
let
him
go
to
the
devil
he
said
savagely
doubling
his
fists
and
turning
swiftly
no
no
dick
remonstrated
dorothy
seizing
his
arm
he
treated
us
very
well
and
saved
my
life
once
anyway
you
must
kill
him
no
i
suppose
not
grudgingly
assented
her
lover
and
i
wo
either
unless
he
gives
me
at
least
half
an
excuse
we
might
iron
him
to
a
post
suggested
crane
doubtfully
i
think
there
a
better
way
replied
seaton
he
may
be
able
to
work
his
way
his
brain
hits
on
all
twelve
and
he
strong
as
a
bull
our
chance
of
getting
back
is
a
certainty
as
you
know
he
turned
to
duquesne
i
heard
that
your
word
is
good
it
has
never
been
broken
will
you
give
your
word
to
act
as
one
of
the
party
for
the
good
of
us
all
if
we
do
iron
you
yes
until
we
get
back
to
the
earth
provided
of
course
that
i
reserve
the
right
to
escape
at
any
time
between
now
and
then
if
i
wish
to
and
can
do
so
without
injuring
the
vessel
or
any
member
of
the
party
in
any
way
agreed
let
get
busy
we
altogether
too
close
to
that
dud
there
to
suit
me
sit
tight
everybody
we
on
our
way
he
cried
as
he
turned
to
the
board
applied
one
notch
of
power
and
shut
off
the
attractor
the
skylark
slowed
down
a
trifle
in
its
mad
fall
the
other
vessel
continued
on
its
way
a
helpless
hulk
manned
by
a
corpse
falling
to
destruction
upon
the
bleak
wastes
of
a
desert
world
hold
on
said
duquesne
sharply
your
power
is
the
same
as
mine
was
in
proportion
to
your
mass
is
it
yes
then
our
goose
is
cooked
i
could
pull
away
from
it
with
everything
i
had
could
even
swing
out
enough
to
make
an
orbit
either
hyperbolic
or
elliptical
around
it
with
a
reserve
bar
you
will
be
able
to
make
an
orbit
but
you
ca
get
away
from
it
thanks
for
the
dope
that
saves
our
wasting
some
effort
our
can
be
doubled
up
in
emergencies
thanks
to
cautious
old
bean
we
simply
double
her
up
and
go
away
from
here
there
is
one
thing
we
did
consider
quite
enough
said
crane
thoughtfully
i
started
to
faint
back
there
before
the
full
power
of
even
one
motor
was
in
use
with
the
motor
doubled
each
of
us
will
be
held
down
by
a
force
of
many
tons
we
would
all
be
helpless
yes
added
dorothy
with
foreboding
in
her
eyes
we
were
all
unconscious
on
the
way
out
except
dr
duquesne
well
then
blackie
and
i
as
the
huskiest
members
of
the
party
will
give
her
the
juice
until
only
one
of
us
is
left
with
his
eyes
open
if
that
is
enough
to
pull
us
clear
we
have
to
give
her
the
whole
works
and
let
her
ramble
by
herself
after
we
all
go
out
how
about
it
blackie
unconsciously
falling
into
the
old
bureau
nickname
do
you
think
we
can
make
it
stop
at
unconsciousness
with
double
power
on
duquesne
studied
the
two
girls
carefully
with
oxygen
in
the
helmets
instead
of
air
we
all
may
be
able
to
stand
it
these
special
cushions
keep
the
body
from
flattening
out
as
it
normally
would
under
such
a
pressure
the
unconsciousness
is
simply
a
suffocation
caused
by
the
lateral
muscles
being
unable
to
lift
the
ribs
in
other
words
the
are
strong
enough
for
the
added
work
put
upon
them
at
least
we
stand
a
chance
this
way
we
may
live
through
the
pressure
while
we
are
pulling
away
and
we
certainly
shall
die
if
we
do
pull
away
after
a
brief
consultation
the
men
set
to
work
with
furious
haste
while
crane
placed
extra
bars
in
each
of
the
motors
and
duquesne
made
careful
observations
upon
the
apparent
size
of
the
now
plainly
visible
world
toward
which
they
were
being
drawn
so
irresistibly
seaton
connected
the
helmets
with
the
through
a
valve
upon
the
board
by
means
of
which
he
could
change
at
will
the
oxygen
content
of
the
air
they
breathed
he
then
placed
the
strange
girl
who
seemed
dazed
by
the
frightful
sensation
of
their
fall
upon
one
of
the
seats
fitted
the
cumbersome
helmet
upon
her
head
strapped
her
carefully
into
place
and
turned
to
dorothy
in
an
instant
they
were
in
each
other
arms
he
felt
her
labored
breathing
and
the
wild
beating
of
her
heart
pressed
so
closely
to
his
and
saw
the
fear
of
the
unknown
in
the
violet
depths
of
her
eyes
but
she
looked
at
him
unflinchingly
dick
sweetheart
if
this
is
he
interrupted
her
with
a
kiss
it
is
yet
dottie
mine
this
is
merely
a
trial
effort
to
see
what
we
will
have
to
do
to
get
away
next
time
will
be
the
time
to
worry
i
not
worried
really
but
in
case
you
see
i
we
the
gray
eyes
softened
and
misted
over
as
he
pressed
his
cheek
to
hers
i
understand
sweetheart
he
whispered
this
is
not
but
if
we
do
pull
through
we
go
together
and
that
is
what
we
both
want
as
crane
and
duquesne
finished
their
tasks
seaton
fitted
his
sweetheart
helmet
placed
her
tenderly
upon
the
seat
buckled
the
heavy
restraining
straps
about
her
slender
body
and
donned
his
own
helmet
he
took
his
place
at
the
main
instrument
board
duquesne
stationing
himself
at
the
other
what
did
you
read
on
it
blackie
asked
seaton
two
degrees
one
minute
twelve
seconds
diameter
replied
duquesne
altogether
too
close
for
comfort
how
shall
we
apply
the
power
one
of
us
must
stay
awake
or
we
go
on
as
long
as
the
bars
last
you
put
on
one
notch
then
i
put
on
one
we
can
feel
the
bus
jump
with
each
notch
we
keep
it
up
until
one
of
us
is
so
far
gone
that
he
ca
raise
the
bar
the
one
that
raises
last
will
have
to
let
the
ship
run
for
thirty
minutes
or
an
hour
then
cut
down
his
power
then
the
other
fellow
will
revive
and
cut
his
off
for
an
observation
that
all
right
they
took
their
places
and
seaton
felt
the
vessel
slow
down
in
its
horrible
fall
as
duquesne
threw
his
lever
into
the
first
notch
he
responded
instantly
by
advancing
his
own
and
notch
after
notch
the
power
applied
to
the
ship
by
the
now
doubled
motor
was
rapidly
increased
the
passengers
felt
their
suits
envelope
them
and
began
to
labor
for
breath
seaton
slowly
turned
the
mixing
valve
a
little
with
each
advance
of
his
lever
until
pure
oxygen
flowed
through
the
pipes
the
power
levers
had
moved
scarcely
half
of
their
range
yet
minutes
now
intervened
between
each
advance
instead
of
seconds
as
at
the
start
as
each
of
the
two
men
was
determined
that
he
would
make
the
last
advance
the
duel
continued
longer
than
either
would
have
thought
possible
seaton
made
what
he
thought
his
final
effort
and
waited
only
to
feel
after
a
few
minutes
the
upward
surge
telling
him
that
duquesne
was
still
able
to
move
his
lever
his
brain
reeled
his
arm
seemed
paralyzed
by
its
own
enormous
weight
and
felt
as
though
it
the
rolling
table
upon
which
it
rested
and
the
supporting
framework
were
so
immovably
welded
together
that
it
was
impossible
to
move
it
even
the
necessary
to
operate
the
he
could
not
move
his
body
which
was
oppressed
by
a
sickening
weight
his
utmost
efforts
to
breathe
forced
only
a
little
of
the
oxygen
into
his
lungs
which
smarted
painfully
at
the
touch
of
the
undiluted
gas
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
long
retain
consciousness
under
such
conditions
nevertheless
he
summoned
all
his
strength
and
advanced
the
lever
one
more
notch
he
stared
at
the
above
his
head
knowing
that
if
duquesne
could
advance
his
lever
again
he
would
lose
consciousness
and
be
beaten
minute
after
minute
went
by
however
and
the
acceleration
of
the
ship
remained
constant
seaton
knowing
that
he
was
in
sole
control
of
the
fought
to
retain
possession
of
his
faculties
while
the
hands
of
the
clock
told
off
the
interminable
minutes
after
an
eternity
of
time
an
hour
had
passed
and
seaton
attempted
to
cut
down
his
power
only
to
find
with
horror
that
the
long
strain
had
so
weakened
him
that
he
could
not
reverse
the
ratchet
he
was
still
able
however
to
give
the
lever
the
backward
jerk
which
disconnected
the
wires
completely
and
the
safety
straps
creaked
with
the
sudden
stress
as
half
the
power
instantly
shut
off
the
suddenly
released
springs
tried
to
hurl
five
bodies
against
the
ceiling
after
a
few
minutes
duquesne
revived
and
slowly
cut
off
his
power
to
the
dismay
of
both
men
they
were
again
falling
duquesne
hurried
to
the
lower
window
to
make
the
observation
remarking
you
a
better
man
than
i
am
gunga
din
only
because
you
so
badly
bunged
up
one
more
notch
would
got
my
goat
replied
seaton
frankly
as
he
made
his
way
to
dorothy
side
he
noticed
as
he
reached
her
that
crane
had
removed
his
helmet
and
was
approaching
the
other
girl
by
the
time
duquesne
had
finished
the
observation
the
other
passengers
had
completely
recovered
apparently
none
the
worse
for
their
experience
did
we
gain
anything
asked
seaton
eagerly
i
make
it
two
four
thirteen
we
lost
about
two
minutes
of
arc
how
much
power
did
we
have
on
a
little
over
half
points
out
of
sixty
possible
we
were
still
falling
pretty
fast
we
have
to
put
on
everything
we
got
since
neither
of
us
can
put
it
on
we
have
to
rig
up
an
automatic
feed
it
take
time
but
it
the
only
way
the
automatic
control
is
already
there
put
in
crane
forestalling
seaton
explanation
the
only
question
is
whether
we
will
live
through
it
and
that
is
not
really
a
question
since
certain
death
is
the
only
alternative
we
must
do
it
we
sure
must
answered
seaton
soberly
dorothy
gravely
nodded
assent
what
do
you
fellows
think
of
a
little
plus
pressure
on
the
oxygen
asked
seaton
i
think
it
would
help
a
lot
i
think
it
a
good
idea
said
duquesne
and
crane
added
four
or
five
inches
of
water
will
be
about
all
the
pressure
we
can
stand
any
more
might
burn
our
lungs
too
badly
the
pressure
apparatus
was
quickly
arranged
and
the
motors
filled
to
capacity
with
reserve
bars
enough
to
last
hours
the
scientists
having
decided
that
they
must
risk
everything
on
one
trial
and
put
in
enough
if
possible
to
pull
them
clear
out
of
the
influence
of
this
center
of
attraction
as
the
time
lost
in
slowing
up
to
change
bars
might
well
mean
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
where
they
might
lie
at
the
end
of
the
wild
dash
for
safety
how
they
were
to
retrace
their
way
with
their
depleted
supply
of
copper
what
other
dangers
of
dead
star
planet
or
sun
lay
in
their
path
all
these
were
terrifying
questions
that
had
to
be
ignored
duquesne
was
the
only
member
of
the
party
who
actually
felt
any
calmness
the
quiet
of
the
others
expressing
their
courage
in
facing
fear
life
seemed
very
sweet
and
desirable
to
them
the
distant
earth
a
very
paradise
through
dorothy
mind
flashed
the
visions
she
had
built
up
during
long
sweet
hours
visions
of
a
long
life
with
seaton
as
she
breathed
an
inaudible
prayer
she
glanced
up
and
saw
seaton
standing
beside
her
gazing
down
upon
her
with
his
very
soul
in
his
eyes
never
would
she
forget
the
expression
upon
his
face
even
in
that
crucial
hour
his
great
love
for
her
overshadowed
every
other
feeling
and
no
thought
of
self
was
in
his
mind
his
care
was
all
for
her
there
was
a
long
farewell
caress
both
knew
that
it
might
be
goodbye
but
both
were
silent
as
the
violet
eyes
and
the
gray
looked
into
each
other
depths
and
conveyed
messages
far
beyond
the
power
of
words
once
more
he
adjusted
her
helmet
and
strapped
her
into
place
as
crane
had
in
the
meantime
cared
for
the
other
girl
the
men
again
took
their
places
and
seaton
started
the
motor
which
would
automatically
advance
the
speed
levers
one
notch
every
five
seconds
until
the
full
power
of
both
motors
was
exerted
as
the
power
was
increased
he
turned
the
valve
as
before
until
the
helmets
were
filled
with
pure
oxygen
under
a
pressure
of
five
inches
of
water
margaret
spencer
weakened
by
her
imprisonment
was
the
first
to
lose
consciousness
and
soon
afterward
dorothy
felt
her
senses
leave
her
a
in
the
course
of
which
six
mighty
surges
were
felt
as
more
of
the
power
of
the
doubled
motor
was
released
and
crane
had
gone
calmly
analyzing
his
sensations
to
the
last
after
a
time
duquesne
also
lapsed
into
unconsciousness
making
no
particular
effort
to
avoid
it
as
he
knew
that
the
involuntary
muscles
would
function
quite
as
well
without
the
direction
of
the
will
seaton
although
he
knew
it
was
useless
fought
to
keep
his
senses
as
long
as
possible
counting
the
impulses
he
felt
as
the
levers
were
advanced
he
felt
exactly
as
he
had
before
when
he
had
advanced
the
lever
for
the
last
time
a
giant
hand
shut
off
his
breath
completely
though
he
was
fighting
to
his
utmost
for
air
an
intolerable
weight
rested
upon
his
eyeballs
forcing
them
backward
into
his
head
the
universe
whirled
about
him
in
dizzy
circles
orange
and
black
and
green
stars
flashed
before
his
bursting
eyes
the
stars
became
more
brilliant
and
of
more
variegated
colors
and
a
giant
pen
dipped
in
fire
was
writing
equations
and
symbols
upon
his
quivering
brain
he
joined
the
circling
universe
which
he
had
hitherto
kept
away
from
him
by
main
strength
and
whirled
about
his
own
body
tracing
a
logarithmic
spiral
with
infinite
velocity
leaving
his
body
an
infinite
distance
behind
the
stars
and
the
fiery
pen
exploded
in
a
wild
coruscation
of
searing
blinding
light
and
he
plunged
from
his
spiral
into
a
black
abyss
in
spite
of
the
terrific
stress
put
upon
the
machine
every
part
functioned
perfectly
and
soon
after
seaton
had
lost
consciousness
the
vessel
began
to
draw
away
from
the
sinister
globe
slowly
at
first
faster
and
faster
as
more
and
more
of
the
almost
unlimited
power
of
the
mighty
motor
was
released
soon
the
levers
were
out
to
the
last
notch
and
the
machine
was
exerting
its
maximum
effort
one
hour
and
an
observer
upon
the
skylark
would
have
seen
that
the
apparent
size
of
the
massive
unknown
world
was
rapidly
decreasing
twenty
hours
and
it
was
so
far
away
as
to
be
invisible
though
its
effect
was
still
great
forty
hours
and
the
effect
was
slight
sixty
hours
and
the
skylark
was
out
of
range
of
the
slightest
measurable
force
of
the
monster
it
had
left
hurtled
onward
by
the
inconceivable
power
of
the
unleashed
copper
demon
in
its
center
the
skylark
flew
through
the
infinite
reaches
of
interstellar
space
with
an
unthinkable
almost
incalculable
velocity
beside
which
the
velocity
of
light
was
as
that
of
a
snail
to
that
of
a
rifle
bullet
a
velocity
augmented
every
second
by
a
quantity
almost
double
that
of
light
itself
chapter
xi
through
space
into
the
carboniferous
seaton
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
about
him
wonderingly
only
half
conscious
bruised
and
sore
in
every
part
of
his
body
he
could
not
at
first
realize
what
had
happened
instinctively
drawing
a
deep
breath
he
coughed
and
choked
as
the
undiluted
oxygen
filled
his
lungs
bringing
with
it
a
complete
understanding
of
the
situation
knowing
from
the
lack
of
any
apparent
motion
that
the
power
had
been
sufficient
to
pull
the
car
away
from
that
fatal
globe
his
first
thought
was
for
dorothy
and
he
tore
off
his
helmet
and
turned
toward
her
the
force
of
even
that
slight
movement
wafted
him
gently
into
the
air
where
he
hung
suspended
several
minutes
before
his
struggles
enabled
him
to
clutch
a
post
and
draw
himself
down
to
the
floor
a
quick
glance
around
informed
him
that
dorothy
as
well
as
the
others
was
still
unconscious
making
his
way
rapidly
to
her
he
placed
her
face
downward
upon
the
floor
and
began
artificial
respiration
very
soon
he
was
rewarded
by
the
coughing
he
had
longed
to
hear
he
tore
off
her
helmet
and
clasped
her
to
his
breast
in
an
agony
of
relief
while
she
sobbed
convulsively
upon
his
shoulder
the
first
ecstasy
of
their
greeting
over
dorothy
started
guiltily
oh
dick
she
exclaimed
how
about
peggy
you
must
see
how
she
is
never
mind
answered
crane
voice
cheerily
she
is
coming
to
nicely
glancing
around
quickly
they
saw
that
crane
had
already
revived
the
stranger
and
that
duquesne
was
not
in
sight
dorothy
blushed
the
vivid
wave
of
color
rising
to
her
glorious
hair
and
hastily
disengaged
her
arms
from
around
her
lover
neck
drawing
away
from
him
seaton
also
blushing
dropped
his
arms
and
dorothy
floated
away
from
him
frantically
clutching
at
a
brace
just
beyond
reach
pull
me
down
dick
she
called
laughing
gaily
seaton
seizing
her
instinctively
neglected
his
own
anchorage
and
they
hung
in
the
air
together
while
crane
and
margaret
each
holding
a
strap
laughed
with
unrestrained
merriment
tweet

i
a
canary
chuckled
seaton
throw
us
a
rope
a
you
mean
interposed
dorothy
i
knew
that
you
were
a
expert
dick
but
i
did
not
know
that
levitation
was
one
of
your
specialties
remarked
crane
with
mock
gravity
that
is
a
peculiar
pose
you
are
holding
now
what
are
you
doing
sitting
on
an
imaginary
pedestal
i
be
sitting
on
your
neck
if
you
do
get
a
wiggle
on
with
that
rope
retorted
seaton
but
before
crane
had
time
to
obey
the
command
the
floating
couple
had
approached
close
enough
to
the
ceiling
so
that
seaton
with
a
slight
pressure
of
his
hand
against
the
leather
sent
them
floating
back
to
the
floor
within
reach
of
one
of
the
handrails
seaton
made
his
way
to
the
lifted
in
one
of
the
remaining
bars
and
applied
a
little
power
the
skylark
seemed
to
jump
under
them
then
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
back
on
earth
everything
had
its
normal
weight
once
more
as
the
amount
of
power
applied
was
just
enough
to
equal
the
acceleration
of
gravity
after
this
fact
had
been
explained
dorothy
turned
to
margaret
now
that
we
are
able
to
act
intelligently
the
party
should
be
introduced
to
each
other
peggy
this
is
dick
seaton
and
this
is
martin
crane
boys
this
is
miss
margaret
spencer
a
dear
friend
of
mine
these
are
the
boys
i
have
told
you
so
much
about
peggy
dick
knows
all
about
atoms
and
things
he
found
out
how
to
make
the
skylark
go
martin
who
is
quite
a
wonderful
inventor
made
the
engines
and
things
for
it
i
may
have
heard
of
crane
replied
margaret
eagerly
my
father
was
an
inventor
and
i
have
heard
him
speak
of
a
man
named
crane
who
invented
a
lot
of
instruments
for
airplanes
he
used
to
say
that
the
crane
instruments
revolutionized
flying
i
wonder
if
you
are
that
mr
crane
that
is
rather
unjustifiably
high
praise
miss
spencer
replied
crane
but
as
i
have
been
guilty
of
one
or
two
things
along
that
line
i
may
be
the
man
he
meant
pardon
me
if
i
seem
to
change
the
subject
put
in
seaton
but
duquesne
we
came
to
at
the
same
time
and
he
went
into
the
galley
to
fix
up
something
to
eat
good
for
him
exclaimed
dorothy
i
simply
starved
to
death
i
would
have
been
demanding
food
long
ago
but
i
have
so
many
aches
and
pains
that
i
did
realize
how
hungry
i
was
until
you
mentioned
it
come
on
peggy
i
know
where
our
room
is
let
go
powder
our
noses
while
these
bewhiskered
gentlemen
reap
their
beards
did
you
bring
along
any
of
my
clothes
dick
or
did
you
forget
them
in
the
excitement
i
did
think
anything
about
clothes
but
martin
did
you
find
your
whole
wardrobe
in
your
room
i
with
you
dot
on
that
eating
proposition
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
the
jamb
off
the
door
after
the
girls
had
gone
seaton
and
crane
went
to
their
rooms
where
they
exercised
vigorously
to
restore
the
circulation
to
their
numbed
bodies
shaved
bathed
and
returned
to
the
saloon
feeling
like
new
men
they
found
the
girls
already
there
seated
at
one
of
the
windows
hail
and
greeting
cried
dorothy
at
sight
of
them
i
hardly
recognized
you
without
your
whiskers
do
hurry
over
here
and
look
out
this
perfectly
wonderful
window
did
you
ever
in
your
born
days
see
anything
like
this
sight
now
that
i
not
scared
i
can
enjoy
it
thoroughly
the
two
men
joined
the
girls
and
peered
out
into
space
through
the
window
which
was
completely
invisible
so
clear
was
the
glass
as
the
four
heads
bent
so
close
together
an
awed
silence
fell
upon
the
little
group
for
the
blackness
of
the
interstellar
void
was
not
the
dark
of
an
earthly
night
but
the
absolute
black
of
the
absence
of
all
light
beside
which
the
black
of
platinum
dust
is
pale
and
gray
and
laid
upon
this
velvet
were
the
jewel
stars
they
were
not
the
twinkling
scintillating
beauties
of
the
earthly
sky
but
minute
points
so
small
as
to
seem
dimensionless
yet
of
dazzling
brilliance
without
the
interference
of
the
air
their
rays
met
the
eye
steadily
and
much
of
the
effect
of
comparative
distance
was
lost
all
seemed
nearer
and
there
was
no
hint
of
familiarity
in
their
arrangement
like
gems
thrown
upon
darkness
they
shone
in
beauty
upon
the
daring
wanderers
who
stood
in
their
car
as
easily
as
though
they
were
upon
their
parent
earth
and
gazed
upon
a
sight
never
before
seen
by
eye
of
man
nor
pictured
in
his
imaginings
through
the
daze
of
their
wonder
a
thought
smote
seaton
like
a
blow
from
a
fist
his
eyes
leaped
to
the
instrument
board
and
he
exclaimed
look
there
mart
we
heading
almost
directly
away
from
the
earth
and
we
must
be
making
billions
of
miles
per
second
after
we
lost
consciousness
the
attraction
of
that
big
dud
back
there
would
swing
us
around
of
course
but
the
bar
should
have
stayed
pointed
somewhere
near
the
earth
as
i
left
it
do
you
suppose
it
could
have
shifted
the
gyroscopes
it
not
only
could
have
it
did
replied
crane
turning
the
bar
until
it
again
pointed
parallel
with
the
which
bore
upon
the
earth
look
at
the
board
the
angle
has
been
changed
through
nearly
half
a
circumference
we
could
carry
gyroscopes
heavy
enough
to
counteract
that
force
but
they
were
heavier
there
oh
sure
you
right
it
mass
not
weight
that
counts
but
we
sure
are
in
one
fine
large
jam
now
instead
of
being
back
to
the
earth
we
where
are
we
anyway
they
made
a
reading
on
an
focused
upon
the
earth
seaton
face
lengthened
as
seconds
passed
when
it
had
come
to
rest
both
men
calculated
the
distance
what
make
it
mart
i
afraid
to
tell
you
my
result
point
replied
crane
calmly
right
right
and
the
time
was
of
thursday
by
the
chronometer
there
we
time
it
again
after
a
while
and
see
how
fast
traveling
it
a
good
thing
you
built
the
ship
chronometers
to
stand
any
kind
of
stress
my
watch
is
a
total
loss
yours
is
too
all
of
our
watches
must
be
broken
we
will
have
to
repair
them
as
soon
as
we
get
time
well
let
eat
next
no
human
being
can
stand
my
aching
void
much
longer
how
about
you
dot
yes
for
cat
sake
let
get
busy
she
mimicked
him
gaily
doctor
duquesne
had
dinner
ready
for
ages
and
we
all
dying
by
inches
of
hunger
the
wanderers
battered
bruised
and
sore
seated
themselves
at
a
folding
table
seaton
keeping
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
bar
and
upon
the
course
while
enjoying
dorothy
presence
to
the
full
crane
and
margaret
talked
easily
but
at
intervals
save
when
directly
addressed
duquesne
maintained
silence
not
the
silence
of
one
who
knows
himself
to
be
an
intruder
but
the
silence
of
perfect
the
meal
over
the
girls
washed
the
dishes
and
busied
themselves
in
the
galley
seaton
and
crane
made
another
observation
upon
the
earth
requesting
duquesne
to
stay
out
of
the
engine
room
as
they
called
the
space
surrounding
the
main
instrument
board
where
were
located
the
and
the
mechanism
controlling
the
attractor
about
which
duquesne
knew
nothing
as
they
rejoined
duquesne
in
the
main
compartment
seaton
said
duquesne
we
nearly
five
thousand
away
from
the
earth
and
are
getting
farther
at
the
rate
of
about
one
per
minute
i
suppose
that
it
would
be
poor
technique
to
ask
how
you
know
it
would
very
poor
our
figures
are
right
the
difficulty
is
that
we
have
only
four
bars
left
enough
to
stop
us
and
a
little
to
spare
but
not
nearly
enough
to
get
back
with
even
if
we
could
take
a
chance
on
drifting
straight
that
far
without
being
swung
off
which
of
course
is
impossible
that
means
that
we
must
land
somewhere
and
dig
some
copper
then
exactly
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
a
place
to
land
seaton
picked
out
a
distant
star
in
their
course
and
observed
it
through
the
spectroscope
since
it
was
found
to
contain
copper
in
notable
amounts
all
agreed
that
its
planets
probably
also
contained
copper
do
know
whether
we
can
stop
that
soon
or
not
remarked
seaton
as
he
set
the
levers
but
we
may
as
well
have
something
to
shoot
at
better
take
our
regular
tricks
had
we
mart
it
a
wonder
we
got
as
far
as
this
without
striking
another
snag
i
take
the
first
trick
at
the
board
beat
it
to
bed
not
so
fast
dick
argued
crane
as
seaton
turned
toward
the
it
my
turn
flip
a
nickel
suggested
seaton
heads
i
get
it
crane
flipped
a
coin
heads
it
was
and
the
party
went
to
their
rooms
all
save
dorothy
who
lingered
after
the
others
to
bid
her
lover
a
more
intimate
seated
beside
him
his
arm
around
her
and
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
dorothy
exclaimed
oh
dicky
dicky
it
is
wonderful
to
be
with
you
again
i
lived
as
many
years
in
the
last
week
as
we
have
covered
miles
seaton
kissed
her
with
ardor
then
turned
her
fair
face
up
to
his
and
gazed
hungrily
at
every
feature
it
sure
was
awful
until
we
found
you
sweetheart
girl
those
two
days
at
wilson
were
the
worst
and
longest
i
ever
put
in
i
could
have
wrung
martin
cautious
old
neck
but
is
he
a
wiz
at
preparing
for
trouble
we
sure
owe
him
a
lot
little
dimpled
lady
dorothy
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
a
smile
quirked
at
one
corner
of
her
mouth
and
a
dimple
appeared
seaton
promptly
kissed
it
whereupon
it
deepened
audaciously
what
are
you
thinking
about
mischief
he
asked
only
of
how
martin
is
going
to
be
paid
what
we
owe
him
she
answered
teasingly
do
let
the
debt
worry
you
any
spill
the
news
reddy
he
commanded
as
his
arm
tightened
about
her
she
stuck
out
a
tiny
tip
of
red
tongue
at
him
do
let
peggy
find
out
he
a
millionaire
why
not
he
asked
wonderingly
then
he
saw
her
point
and
laughed
you
little
matchmaker
i
do
care
laugh
if
you
want
to
martin
as
nice
a
man
as
i
know
and
peggy
a
real
darling
do
you
let
slip
a
word
about
money
that
all
she
would
think
any
less
of
him
would
she
dick
sometimes
you
are
absolutely
dumb
it
would
spoil
everything
if
she
knew
he
was
a
millionaire
she
would
be
scared
to
death
not
of
him
of
course
but
because
she
would
think
that
he
would
think
that
she
was
chasing
him
and
then
of
course
he
would
think
that
she
was
see
as
it
is
she
acts
perfectly
natural
and
so
does
he
did
you
notice
that
while
we
were
eating
they
talked
together
for
at
least
fifteen
minutes
about
her
father
invention
and
the
way
they
stole
the
plans
and
one
thing
and
another
i
do
believe
he
has
talked
that
much
to
any
girl
except
me
the
last
five
years
and
he
would
talk
to
me
until
he
knew
that
i
could
see
any
man
except
you
much
as
we
like
martin
got
to
admit
that
about
him
he
been
chased
so
much
that
he
wild
if
any
other
girl
he
knows
had
talked
to
him
that
long
he
would
have
been
off
to
the
north
pole
or
somewhere
the
next
morning
and
the
best
part
of
it
is
that
he
did
think
anything
of
it
you
think
she
is
domesticating
the
wild
man
now
dick
do
be
foolish
you
know
what
i
mean
martin
is
a
perfect
dear
but
if
she
knew
that
he
is
reynolds
crane
everything
would
be
ruined
you
know
yourself
how
horribly
hard
it
is
to
get
through
his
shell
to
the
real
martin
underneath
he
is
lonely
and
miserable
inside
i
know
and
the
right
kind
of
girl
one
that
would
treat
him
right
would
make
life
heaven
for
him
and
herself
too
yes
and
the
wrong
kind
would
make
it
she
would
interrupted
dorothy
hastily
but
peggy
the
right
kind
would
it
be
fine
to
have
martin
and
peggy
as
happy
almost
as
you
and
i
are
all
right
girlie
i
with
you
he
answered
embracing
her
as
though
he
intended
never
to
let
her
go
but
you
better
go
get
some
sleep
you
all
in
considerably
later
when
dorothy
had
finally
gone
seaton
settled
himself
for
the
long
vigil
promptly
at
the
end
of
the
twelve
hours
crane
appeared
alert
of
eye
and
of
bearing
you
look
fresh
as
a
daisy
mart
feeling
fit
fit
as
the
proverbial
fiddle
i
could
not
have
slept
any
better
or
longer
if
i
had
had
a
week
off
seven
hours
and
a
half
is
a
luxury
you
know
all
wrong
old
top
i
need
eight
every
night
and
i
going
to
take
about
ten
this
time
go
to
it
twelve
if
you
like
you
have
earned
it
seaton
stumbled
to
his
room
and
slept
as
though
in
a
trance
for
ten
hours
rising
he
took
his
regular
morning
exercises
and
went
into
the
saloon
all
save
martin
were
there
but
he
had
eyes
only
for
his
sweetheart
who
was
radiantly
beautiful
in
a
dress
of
deep
good
morning
dick
she
hailed
him
joyously
you
woke
up
just
in
time
we
are
all
starving
again
and
were
just
going
to
eat
without
you
good
morning
everybody
i
would
like
to
eat
with
you
dottie
but
got
to
relieve
martin
how
it
be
for
you
to
bring
breakfast
into
the
engine
room
and
cheer
my
solitude
and
let
crane
eat
with
the
others
fine
that
once
you
had
a
good
idea
if
you
never
have
another
after
the
meal
duquesne
who
abhorred
idleness
with
all
his
vigorous
nature
took
the
watches
of
the
party
and
went
upstairs
to
the
shop
which
was
a
mechanical
laboratory
to
repair
them
seaton
stayed
at
the
board
where
dorothy
joined
him
as
a
matter
of
course
crane
and
margaret
sat
down
at
one
of
the
windows
she
told
him
her
story
frankly
and
fully
shuddering
with
horror
as
she
recalled
the
awful
helpless
fall
during
which
perkins
had
met
his
end
dick
and
i
have
a
heavy
score
to
settle
with
that
steel
crowd
and
with
duquesne
crane
said
slowly
we
have
no
evidence
that
will
hold
in
law
but
some
day
duquesne
will
himself
we
could
convict
him
of
abduction
now
but
the
penalty
for
that
is
too
mild
for
what
he
has
done
perkins
death
was
not
murder
then
oh
no
it
was
purely
perkins
would
have
killed
him
if
he
could
and
he
really
deserved
it
perkins
was
a
perfect
fiend
the
doctor
as
they
call
him
is
no
better
although
entirely
different
he
is
so
utterly
heartless
and
ruthless
so
cold
and
scientific
do
you
know
him
very
well
we
know
all
that
about
him
and
more
and
yet
dorothy
said
he
saved
her
life
he
did
from
perkins
but
i
still
think
it
was
because
he
did
want
perkins
meddling
in
his
affairs
he
seems
to
me
to
be
the
very
incarnation
of
a
fixed
purpose
to
advance
himself
in
the
world
that
expresses
my
thoughts
exactly
but
he
slips
occasionally
as
in
this
instance
and
he
will
again
he
will
have
to
walk
very
carefully
while
he
is
with
us
nothing
would
please
dick
better
than
an
excuse
for
killing
him
and
i
must
admit
that
i
feel
very
much
the
same
way
yes
all
of
us
do
and
the
way
he
acts
proves
what
a
machine
he
is
he
knows
just
exactly
how
far
to
go
and
never
goes
beyond
it
they
felt
the
skylark
lurch
slightly
oh
mart
called
seaton
going
to
pass
that
star
we
were
headed
for
too
fast
to
stop
i
giving
it
a
wide
berth
and
picking
out
another
one
there
a
big
planet
a
few
million
miles
off
in
line
with
the
main
door
and
another
one
almost
dead
ahead
that
is
straight
down
we
sure
are
traveling
look
at
that
sun
flit
by
they
saw
the
two
planets
one
like
a
small
moon
the
other
like
a
large
star
and
saw
the
strange
sun
increase
rapidly
in
size
as
the
skylark
flew
on
at
such
a
pace
that
any
earthly
distance
would
have
been
covered
as
soon
as
it
was
begun
so
appalling
was
their
velocity
that
their
ship
was
bathed
in
the
light
of
that
sun
for
only
a
short
time
then
was
again
surrounded
by
the
indescribable
darkness
their
flight
without
a
pilot
had
seemed
a
miracle
now
it
seemed
entirely
possible
that
they
might
fly
in
a
straight
line
for
weeks
without
encountering
any
obstacle
so
vast
was
the
emptiness
in
comparison
with
the
points
of
light
that
punctuated
it
now
and
then
they
passed
so
close
to
a
star
that
it
apparently
moved
rapidly
but
for
the
most
part
the
silent
sentinels
stood
like
distant
mountain
peaks
to
the
travelers
in
an
express
train
in
the
same
position
for
many
minutes
awed
by
the
immensity
of
the
universe
the
two
at
the
window
were
silent
not
with
the
silence
of
embarrassment
but
with
that
of
two
friends
in
the
presence
of
something
beyond
the
reach
of
words
as
they
stared
out
into
the
infinity
each
felt
as
never
before
the
pitiful
smallness
of
even
our
whole
solar
system
and
the
utter
insignificance
of
human
beings
and
their
works
silently
their
minds
reached
out
to
each
other
in
mutual
understanding
unconsciously
margaret
half
shuddered
and
moved
closer
to
her
companion
the
movement
attracting
his
attention
but
not
her
own
a
tender
expression
came
into
crane
steady
blue
eyes
as
he
looked
down
at
the
beautiful
young
woman
by
his
side
for
beautiful
she
undoubtedly
was
untroubled
rest
and
plentiful
food
had
erased
the
marks
of
her
imprisonment
dorothy
deep
manifestly
unassumed
faith
in
the
ability
of
seaton
and
crane
to
bring
them
safely
back
to
earth
had
quieted
her
fears
and
a
complete
costume
of
dorothy
simple
but
clothes
which
fitted
her
perfectly
and
in
which
she
looked
her
best
and
knew
it
had
completely
restored
her
he
quickly
glanced
away
and
again
gazed
at
the
stars
but
now
in
addition
to
the
wonders
of
space
he
saw
masses
of
wavy
black
hair
upon
a
queenly
head
deep
down
brown
eyes
half
veiled
by
long
black
lashes
sweet
sensitive
lips
a
firmly
rounded
but
dimpled
chin
and
a
young
body
after
a
time
she
drew
a
deep
tremulous
breath
as
he
turned
her
eyes
met
his
in
their
shadowy
depths
still
troubled
by
the
mystery
of
the
unknowable
he
read
her
very
soul
the
soul
of
a
real
woman
i
had
hoped
said
margaret
slowly
to
take
a
long
flight
above
the
clouds
but
anything
like
this
never
entered
my
mind
how
unbelievably
great
it
is
so
much
vaster
than
any
perception
we
could
get
upon
earth
it
seems
strange
that
we
were
ever
awed
by
the
sea
or
the
mountains
and
yet
she
paused
with
her
lip
caught
under
two
white
teeth
then
went
on
hesitatingly
does
it
seem
to
you
crane
that
there
is
something
in
man
as
great
as
all
this
otherwise
dorothy
and
i
could
not
be
sailing
here
in
a
wonder
like
the
lark
which
you
and
dick
seaton
have
made
since
from
the
first
dorothy
had
timed
her
waking
hours
with
those
of
seaton
waiting
upon
him
preparing
his
meals
and
lightening
the
long
hours
of
his
vigils
at
the
board
margaret
took
it
upon
herself
to
do
the
same
thing
for
crane
but
often
they
assembled
in
the
and
there
was
much
fun
and
laughter
as
well
as
serious
talk
among
the
four
margaret
was
quickly
accepted
as
a
friend
and
proved
a
delightful
companion
her
wavy
hair
the
only
color
in
the
world
that
could
hold
its
own
with
dorothy
auburn
glory
framed
features
and
strong
yet
of
womanly
softness
and
in
this
genial
atmosphere
her
quick
tongue
had
a
delicate
wit
and
a
facility
of
expression
that
delighted
all
three
dorothy
after
the
manner
of
southern
women
became
the
hostess
of
this
odd
party
as
she
styled
it
and
unconsciously
adopted
the
attitude
of
a
lady
in
her
own
home
early
in
their
flight
crane
suggested
that
they
should
take
notes
upon
the
systems
of
stars
through
which
were
passing
i
know
very
little
of
astronomy
he
said
to
seaton
but
with
our
telescope
spectroscope
and
other
instruments
we
should
be
able
to
take
some
data
that
will
be
of
interest
to
astronomers
possibly
miss
spencer
would
be
willing
to
help
us
sure
seaton
returned
readily
we
be
idiots
to
let
a
chance
like
this
slide
go
to
it
margaret
was
delighted
at
the
opportunity
to
help
taking
notes
is
the
best
thing
i
do
she
cried
and
called
for
a
pad
and
pencil
stationed
at
the
window
they
fell
to
work
in
earnest
for
several
hours
crane
took
observations
calculated
distances
and
dictated
notes
to
margaret
the
stars
are
wonderfully
different
she
exclaimed
to
him
once
that
planet
i
sure
has
strange
and
lovely
life
upon
it
see
how
its
color
differs
from
most
of
the
others
we
have
seen
so
near
it
is
rosy
and
soft
like
a
home
fire
i
sure
its
people
are
happy
they
fell
into
a
long
discussion
laughing
a
little
at
their
fancies
were
these
multitudes
of
worlds
peopled
as
the
earth
could
it
be
that
only
upon
earth
had
occurred
the
right
combination
for
the
generation
of
life
so
that
the
rest
of
the
universe
was
unpeopled
it
is
unthinkable
that
they
are
all
uninhabited
mused
crane
there
must
be
life
the
beings
may
not
exist
in
any
form
with
which
we
are
familiar
they
may
well
be
fulfilling
some
purpose
in
ways
so
different
from
ours
that
we
should
be
unable
to
understand
them
at
all
margaret
eyes
widened
in
startled
apprehension
but
in
a
moment
she
shook
herself
and
laughed
but
there
no
reason
to
suppose
they
would
be
awful
she
remarked
and
turned
with
renewed
interest
to
the
window
thus
days
went
by
and
the
skylark
passed
one
solar
system
after
another
with
a
velocity
so
great
that
it
was
impossible
to
land
upon
any
planet
margaret
association
with
crane
begun
as
a
duty
soon
became
an
intense
pleasure
for
them
both
taking
notes
or
seated
at
the
board
in
companionable
conversation
or
sympathetic
silence
they
compressed
into
a
few
days
more
real
companionship
than
is
ordinarily
enjoyed
in
months
oftener
and
oftener
as
time
went
on
crane
found
the
vision
of
his
dream
home
floating
in
his
mind
as
he
steered
the
skylark
in
her
meteoric
flight
or
as
he
strapped
himself
into
his
narrow
bed
now
however
the
central
figure
of
the
vision
instead
of
being
an
indistinct
blur
was
clear
and
sharply
defined
and
for
her
part
more
and
more
was
margaret
drawn
to
the
quiet
and
unassuming
but
utterly
dependable
and
steadfast
young
inventor
with
his
wide
knowledge
and
his
keen
incisive
mind
sometimes
when
far
from
any
star
the
pilot
would
desert
his
post
and
join
the
others
at
meals
upon
one
such
occasion
seaton
asked
how
the
book
on
astronomy
oh
learned
ones
it
will
be
as
interesting
as
egyptian
hieroglyphics
margaret
replied
as
she
opened
her
notebook
and
showed
him
pages
of
figures
and
symbols
may
i
see
it
miss
spencer
asked
duquesne
from
across
the
small
table
extending
his
hand
she
looked
at
him
hot
hostility
in
her
brown
eyes
and
he
dropped
his
hand
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
with
amused
irony
after
the
meal
seaton
and
crane
held
a
short
consultation
and
the
former
called
to
the
girls
asking
them
to
join
in
the
council
of
war
there
was
a
moment
silence
before
crane
said
diffidently
we
have
been
talking
about
duquesne
miss
spencer
trying
to
decide
a
very
important
problem
seaton
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
as
the
color
again
deepened
in
margaret
face
and
dorothy
laughed
outright
talk
about
a
temper
your
hair
must
be
dyed
peggy
i
know
i
acted
like
a
naughty
child
margaret
said
ruefully
but
he
makes
me
perfectly
furious
and
scares
me
at
the
same
time
a
few
more
remarks
like
that
beg
your
pardon
of
his
and
i
would
have
a
thought
left
in
my
head
seaton
who
had
opened
his
mouth
shut
it
again
ludicrously
without
saying
a
word
and
margaret
gave
him
a
startled
glance
now
i
said
it
she
exclaimed
i
not
afraid
of
him
boys
really
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
seaton
plunged
in
what
we
were
trying
to
get
up
nerve
enough
to
say
is
that
he
be
a
good
man
on
the
astronomy
job
and
crane
added
quickly
he
undoubtedly
knows
more
about
it
than
i
do
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
lose
the
chance
of
using
him
besides
dick
and
i
think
it
rather
dangerous
to
leave
him
so
much
time
to
himself
in
which
to
work
up
a
plan
against
us
he
cooking
one
right
now
i
bet
a
hat
seaton
put
in
and
crane
added
if
you
are
sure
that
you
have
no
objections
miss
spencer
we
might
go
below
where
we
can
have
it
dark
and
all
three
of
us
see
what
we
can
make
of
the
stargazing
we
are
really
losing
an
unusual
opportunity
margaret
hid
gallantly
any
reluctance
she
might
have
felt
i
would
deserve
to
be
here
if
i
ca
work
with
the
doctor
and
hate
him
at
the
same
time
good
for
you
peg
you
a
regular
fellow
seaton
exclaimed
a
trump
finally
the
enormous
velocity
of
the
cruiser
was
sufficiently
reduced
to
effect
a
landing
a
sun
was
located
and
a
course
was
laid
toward
its
nearest
planet
as
the
vessel
approached
its
goal
a
deep
undercurrent
of
excitement
kept
all
the
passengers
feverishly
occupied
they
watched
the
distant
globe
grow
larger
glowing
through
its
atmosphere
more
and
more
clearly
as
a
great
disk
of
white
light
its
outline
softened
by
the
air
about
it
two
satellites
were
close
beside
it
its
sun
a
great
blazing
orb
a
little
nearer
than
the
planet
looked
so
great
and
so
hot
that
margaret
became
uneasy
is
it
dangerous
to
get
so
close
dick
we
might
burn
up
we
not
without
an
atmosphere
he
laughed
oh
murmured
the
girl
apologetically
i
might
have
known
that
dropping
rapidly
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
planet
they
measured
its
density
and
analyzed
it
in
apparatus
installed
for
that
purpose
finding
that
its
composition
was
very
similar
to
the
earth
air
and
that
its
pressure
was
not
enough
greater
to
be
uncomfortable
when
within
one
thousand
feet
of
the
surface
seaton
weighed
a
weight
upon
a
finding
that
it
weighed
five
and
a
half
pounds
thus
ascertaining
that
the
planet
was
either
somewhat
larger
than
the
earth
or
more
dense
the
ground
was
almost
hidden
by
a
rank
growth
of
vegetation
but
here
and
there
appeared
openings
seaton
glanced
at
the
faces
about
him
tense
interest
marked
them
all
dorothy
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
shone
she
looked
at
him
with
awe
and
pride
a
strange
world
dorothy
he
said
gravely
you
are
not
afraid
not
with
you
she
answered
i
am
only
thrilled
with
wonder
columbus
at
san
salvador
said
margaret
her
dark
eyes
paying
their
tribute
of
admiration
a
dark
flush
mounted
swiftly
into
seaton
brown
face
and
he
sought
to
throw
most
of
the
burden
upon
crane
but
catching
upon
his
face
also
a
look
of
praise
almost
of
tenderness
he
quickly
turned
to
the
controls
man
the
boats
he
ordered
an
imaginary
crew
and
the
skylark
descended
rapidly
landing
upon
one
of
the
open
spaces
they
found
the
ground
solid
and
stepped
out
what
had
appeared
to
be
a
glade
was
in
reality
a
rock
or
rather
a
ledge
of
apparently
solid
metal
with
scarcely
a
loose
fragment
to
be
seen
at
one
end
of
the
ledge
rose
a
giant
tree
wonderfully
symmetrical
but
of
a
peculiar
form
its
branches
were
longer
at
the
top
than
at
the
bottom
and
it
possessed
broad
leaves
long
thorns
and
odd
flexible
tendrils
it
stood
as
an
outpost
of
the
dense
vegetation
beyond
totally
unlike
the
forests
of
earth
were
those
trees
towering
two
hundred
feet
into
the
air
they
were
of
an
intensely
vivid
green
and
stood
motionless
in
the
still
hot
air
of
noonday
not
a
sign
of
animal
life
was
to
be
seen
the
whole
landscape
seemed
asleep
the
five
strangers
stood
near
their
vessel
conversing
in
low
tones
and
enjoying
the
sensation
of
solid
ground
beneath
their
feet
after
a
few
minutes
duquesne
remarked
this
is
undoubtedly
a
newer
planet
than
ours
i
should
say
that
it
was
in
the
carboniferous
age
are
those
trees
like
those
in
the
seaton
true
as
time
blackie
there
probably
wo
be
a
human
race
here
for
ages
unless
we
bring
out
some
colonists
seaton
kicked
at
one
of
the
loose
lumps
of
metal
questioningly
with
his
heavy
shoe
finding
that
it
was
as
immovable
as
though
it
were
part
of
the
ledge
bending
over
he
found
that
it
required
all
his
great
strength
to
lift
it
and
he
stared
at
it
with
an
expression
of
surprise
which
turned
to
amazement
as
he
peered
closer
duquesne
look
at
this
duquesne
studied
the
metal
and
was
shaken
out
of
his
habitual
taciturnity
platinum
by
all
the
little
gods
we
grab
some
of
this
while
the
grabbing
good
announced
seaton
and
the
few
visible
lumps
were
rolled
into
the
car
if
we
had
a
pickaxe
we
could
chop
some
more
off
one
of
those
sharp
ledges
down
there
there
an
axe
in
the
shop
replied
duquesne
i
go
get
it
go
ahead
i
soon
be
with
you
keep
close
together
warned
crane
as
the
four
moved
slowly
down
the
slope
this
is
none
too
safe
dick
no
it
is
mart
but
we
got
to
see
whether
we
ca
find
some
copper
and
i
would
like
to
get
some
more
of
this
stuff
too
i
think
it
platinum
i
believe
that
it
x
as
they
reached
the
broken
projections
margaret
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
and
screamed
the
others
saw
that
her
face
was
white
and
her
eyes
wide
with
horror
and
seaton
instinctively
drew
his
pistol
as
he
whirled
about
only
to
check
his
finger
on
the
trigger
and
lower
his
hand
nothing
but
bullets
he
growled
in
disgust
and
in
helpless
silence
the
four
watched
an
unspeakably
hideous
monster
slowly
appear
from
behind
the
skylark
its
four
huge
squat
legs
supported
a
body
at
least
a
hundred
feet
long
pursy
and
ungainly
at
the
extremity
of
a
long
and
sinuous
neck
a
comparatively
small
head
seemed
composed
entirely
of
a
cavernous
mouth
armed
with
row
upon
row
of
carnivorous
teeth
dorothy
gasped
with
terror
and
both
girls
shrank
closer
to
the
two
men
who
maintained
a
baffled
silence
as
the
huge
beast
passed
his
revolting
head
along
the
hull
of
the
vessel
i
dare
not
shoot
martin
seaton
whispered
it
would
wreck
the
bus
have
you
got
any
solid
bullets
no
we
must
hide
behind
these
small
ledges
until
it
goes
away
answered
crane
his
eyes
upon
margaret
colorless
face
you
two
hide
behind
that
one
we
will
take
this
one
oh
well
it
nothing
to
worry
about
anyway
we
can
kill
him
as
soon
as
he
gets
far
enough
away
from
the
boat
said
seaton
as
with
dorothy
clinging
to
him
he
dropped
behind
one
of
the
ledges
margaret
her
staring
eyes
fixed
upon
the
monster
remained
standing
until
crane
touched
her
gently
and
drew
her
down
beside
him
he
will
go
away
soon
his
even
voice
assured
her
we
are
in
no
danger
in
spite
of
their
predicament
a
feeling
of
happiness
flowed
through
crane
whole
being
as
he
crouched
beside
the
wall
of
metal
with
one
arm
protectingly
around
margaret
and
he
longed
to
protect
her
through
life
as
he
was
protecting
her
then
accustomed
as
he
was
to
dangerous
situations
he
felt
no
fear
he
felt
only
a
great
tenderness
for
the
girl
by
his
side
who
had
ceased
trembling
but
was
still
staring
at
the
monster
through
a
crevice
scared
peggy
he
whispered
not
now
martin
but
if
you
were
here
i
would
die
of
fright
at
this
reply
his
arm
tightened
involuntarily
but
he
forced
it
to
relax
it
will
not
be
long
he
promised
himself
silently
until
she
is
back
at
home
among
her
friends
and
then
there
came
the
crack
of
a
rifle
from
the
skylark
there
was
an
awful
roar
from
the
dinosaur
which
was
quickly
silenced
by
a
stream
of
bullets
blackie
on
the
job
let
go
cried
seaton
and
they
raced
up
the
slope
making
a
detour
to
avoid
the
writhing
and
mutilated
mass
they
plunged
through
the
opening
door
duquesne
shut
it
behind
them
and
in
overwhelming
relief
the
adventurers
huddled
together
as
from
the
wilderness
without
there
arose
an
appalling
tumult
the
scene
so
quiet
a
few
moments
before
was
instantly
changed
the
trees
the
swamp
and
the
air
seemed
filled
with
monsters
so
hideous
as
to
stagger
the
imagination
winged
lizards
of
prodigious
size
hurtled
through
the
air
plunging
to
death
against
the
armored
hull
indescribable
flying
monsters
with
feathers
like
birds
but
with
the
fangs
of
tigers
attacked
viciously
dorothy
screamed
and
started
back
as
a
thing
with
a
body
ten
feet
in
length
leaped
at
the
window
in
front
of
her
its
terrible
sting
spraying
the
glass
with
venom
as
it
fell
to
the
ground
a
huge
spider
if
an
creature
with
spines
instead
of
hair
eyes
and
a
bloated
globular
body
weighing
hundreds
of
pounds
may
be
called
a
spider
leaped
upon
it
and
mighty
mandibles
against
poisonous
sting
the
furious
battle
raged
several
cockroaches
climbed
nimbly
across
the
fallen
timber
of
the
morass
and
began
feeding
voraciously
upon
the
body
of
the
dead
dinosaur
only
to
be
driven
away
by
another
animal
which
all
three
men
recognized
instantly
as
that
king
of
all
prehistoric
creatures
the
tiger
this
newcomer
a
tawny
beast
towering
fifteen
feet
high
at
the
shoulder
had
a
mouth
disproportionate
even
to
his
great
size
a
mouth
armed
with
four
great
more
than
three
feet
in
length
he
had
barely
begun
his
meal
however
when
he
was
challenged
by
another
nightmare
a
something
apparently
between
a
dinosaur
and
a
crocodile
at
the
first
note
the
tiger
charged
clawing
striking
rending
each
other
with
their
terrible
teeth
a
veritable
avalanche
of
bloodthirsty
rage
the
combatants
stormed
up
and
down
the
little
island
but
the
fighters
were
rudely
interrupted
and
the
earthly
visitors
discovered
that
in
this
primitive
world
it
was
not
only
animal
life
that
was
dangerous
illustration
the
great
tree
standing
on
the
farther
edge
of
the
island
suddenly
bent
over
lashing
out
like
a
snake
and
grasping
both
it
transfixed
them
with
the
terrible
thorns
which
were
now
seen
to
be
armed
with
needlepoints
and
to
possess
barbs
like
the
great
tree
standing
on
the
farther
edge
of
the
island
suddenly
bent
over
lashing
out
like
a
snake
and
grasping
both
it
transfixed
them
with
the
terrible
thorns
which
were
now
seen
to
be
armed
with
needlepoints
and
to
possess
barbs
like
it
ripped
at
them
with
the
long
branches
which
were
veritable
spears
the
broad
leaves
armed
with
revolting
sucking
disks
closed
about
the
two
animals
while
the
long
slender
twigs
each
of
which
was
now
seen
to
have
an
eye
at
its
extremity
waved
about
watching
each
movement
of
the
captives
from
a
safe
distance
if
the
struggle
between
the
two
animals
had
been
awful
this
was
titanic
the
air
was
torn
by
the
roars
of
the
reptile
the
screams
of
the
great
cat
and
the
shrieks
of
the
tree
the
very
ground
rocked
with
the
ferocity
of
the
conflict
there
could
be
but
one
result
soon
the
tree
having
absorbed
the
two
gladiators
resumed
its
upright
position
in
all
its
beauty
the
members
of
the
little
group
stared
at
each
other
sick
at
heart
this
is
no
place
to
start
a
i
think
we
better
beat
it
remarked
seaton
presently
wiping
drops
of
perspiration
from
his
forehead
i
think
so
acquiesced
crane
we
found
air
and
conditions
here
we
probably
will
elsewhere
are
you
all
right
dottie
asked
seaton
all
right
dicky
she
replied
the
color
flowing
back
into
her
cheeks
it
scared
me
stiff
and
i
think
i
have
a
lot
of
white
hairs
right
now
but
i
would
have
missed
it
for
anything
she
paused
an
instant
and
continued
dick
there
must
be
a
queer
streak
of
brutality
in
me
but
would
you
mind
blowing
up
that
frightful
tree
i
would
mind
its
nature
if
it
were
ugly
but
look
at
it
it
so
deceptively
beautiful
you
think
it
had
the
disposition
of
a
fiend
would
you
a
general
laugh
relieved
the
nervous
tension
and
seaton
stepped
impulsively
toward
duquesne
with
his
hand
outstretched
you
squared
your
account
blackie
say
the
word
and
the
war
all
off
duquesne
ignored
the
hand
and
glanced
coldly
at
the
group
of
eager
friendly
faces
do
be
sentimental
he
remarked
evenly
as
he
turned
away
to
his
room
emotional
scenes
pain
me
i
gave
my
word
to
act
as
one
of
the
party
well
may
i
be
kicked
to
death
by
little
red
spiders
exclaimed
seaton
dumbfounded
as
the
other
disappeared
he
ai
a
man
he
a
fish
he
a
machine
i
always
thought
so
and
now
i
know
it
stated
margaret
and
the
others
nodded
agreement
well
we
sure
pull
his
cork
as
soon
as
we
get
back
snapped
seaton
he
asked
for
it
and
we
give
him
both
barrels
i
know
i
acted
the
fool
out
there
margaret
apologized
flushing
hotly
and
looking
at
crane
i
do
know
what
made
me
act
so
stupid
i
used
to
have
a
little
nerve
you
were
a
regular
little
brick
peg
seaton
returned
instantly
both
you
girls
are
all
to
the
good
the
right
kind
to
have
along
in
ticklish
places
crane
held
out
his
steady
hand
and
took
margaret
in
a
warm
clasp
for
a
girl
in
your
weakened
condition
you
were
wonderful
you
have
no
reason
to
reproach
yourself
tears
filled
the
dark
eyes
but
were
held
back
bravely
as
she
held
her
head
erect
and
returned
the
pressure
of
his
hand
just
so
you
do
leave
me
behind
next
time
she
returned
lightly
and
the
last
word
concerning
the
incident
had
been
said
seaton
applied
the
power
and
soon
they
were
approaching
another
planet
which
was
surrounded
by
a
dense
fog
descending
slowly
they
found
it
to
be
a
mass
of
steam
and
rank
vapors
under
enormous
pressure
the
next
planet
they
found
to
have
a
clear
atmosphere
but
the
ground
had
a
peculiar
barren
look
and
analysis
of
the
gaseous
envelope
proved
it
to
be
composed
almost
entirely
of
chlorin
no
life
of
an
earthly
type
could
be
possible
upon
such
a
world
and
a
search
for
copper
even
with
the
suits
and
helmets
would
probably
be
fruitless
if
not
impossible
well
remarked
seaton
as
they
were
again
in
space
we
got
enough
copper
to
visit
several
more
worlds
several
more
solar
systems
if
necessary
but
there
a
nice
planet
right
in
front
of
us
it
may
be
the
one
we
looking
for
arrived
in
the
belt
of
atmosphere
they
tested
it
as
before
and
found
it
satisfactory
chapter
xii
the
mastery
of
mind
over
matter
they
descended
rapidly
directly
over
a
large
and
imposing
city
in
the
middle
of
a
vast
level
plain
while
they
were
watching
it
the
city
vanished
and
the
plain
was
transformed
into
a
mountain
summit
the
valleys
falling
away
upon
all
sides
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
well
i
say
that
some
mirage
exclaimed
seaton
rubbing
his
eyes
in
astonishment
i
seen
mirages
before
but
never
anything
like
that
wonder
what
this
air
made
of
but
we
land
anyway
if
we
finally
have
to
swim
the
ship
landed
gently
upon
the
summit
the
occupants
half
expecting
to
see
the
ground
disappear
before
their
eyes
nothing
happened
however
and
they
disembarked
finding
walking
somewhat
difficult
because
of
the
great
mass
of
the
planet
looking
around
they
could
see
no
sign
of
life
but
they
a
presence
near
them
a
vast
invisible
something
suddenly
out
of
the
air
in
front
of
seaton
a
man
materialized
a
man
identical
with
him
in
every
feature
and
detail
even
to
the
smudge
of
grease
under
one
eye
the
small
wrinkles
in
his
heavy
blue
serge
suit
and
the
emblem
of
the
american
chemical
society
upon
his
hello
folks
the
stranger
began
in
seaton
characteristic
careless
speech
i
see
you
surprised
at
my
knowing
your
language
you
a
very
inferior
race
of
animals
do
even
understand
telepathy
understand
the
luminiferous
ether
or
the
relation
between
time
and
space
your
greatest
things
such
as
the
skylark
and
your
are
merely
toys
changing
instantly
from
seaton
form
to
that
of
dorothy
likewise
a
perfect
imitation
the
stranger
continued
without
a
break
atoms
and
electrons
and
things
spinning
and
whirling
in
their
dizzy
little
orbits
it
broke
off
abruptly
continuing
in
the
form
of
duquesne
could
make
myself
clear
as
miss
vaneman
not
a
scientific
convolution
in
her
foolish
little
brain
you
are
a
freer
type
duquesne
unhampered
by
foolish
soft
fancies
but
you
are
very
clumsy
although
working
fairly
well
with
your
poor
tools
brookings
and
his
organization
the
perkins
caf√©
and
its
clumsy
wireless
telephones
all
of
you
are
extremely
low
in
the
scale
such
animals
have
not
been
known
in
our
universe
for
ten
million
years
which
is
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
you
have
millions
of
years
to
go
before
you
will
amount
to
anything
before
you
will
even
rise
above
death
and
its
attendant
necessity
sex
the
strange
being
then
assumed
form
after
form
with
bewildering
rapidity
while
the
spectators
stared
in
dumb
astonishment
in
rapid
succession
it
took
on
the
likeness
of
each
member
of
the
party
of
the
vessel
itself
of
the
watch
in
seaton
pocket
reappearing
as
seaton
well
bunch
it
said
in
a
voice
there
no
mental
exercise
in
you
and
you
such
a
low
form
of
life
that
you
of
no
use
on
this
planet
so
i
dematerialize
you
a
peculiar
light
came
into
its
eyes
as
they
stared
intently
into
seaton
and
he
felt
his
senses
reel
under
the
impact
of
an
awful
mental
force
but
he
fought
back
with
all
his
power
and
remained
standing
what
this
the
stranger
demanded
in
surprise
this
is
the
first
time
in
history
that
mere
matter
which
is
only
a
manifestation
of
mind
has
ever
refused
to
obey
mind
there
a
screw
loose
somewhere
i
must
reason
this
out
it
continued
analytically
changing
instantaneously
into
crane
likeness
ah
i
am
not
a
perfect
reproduction
this
is
the
first
matter
i
have
ever
encountered
that
i
could
not
reproduce
perfectly
there
is
some
subtle
difference
the
external
form
is
the
same
the
organic
structure
likewise
the
molecules
of
substance
are
arranged
as
they
should
be
as
are
also
the
atoms
in
the
molecule
the
electrons
in
the
atom
ah
there
is
the
difficulty
the
arrangement
and
number
of
electrons
as
well
as
positive
charges
are
entirely
different
from
what
i
had
supposed
i
must
derive
the
formula
let
go
folks
said
seaton
hastily
drawing
dorothy
back
toward
the
skylark
this
dematerialization
stunt
may
be
play
for
him
but
i
want
any
of
it
in
my
family
no
you
really
stay
remonstrated
the
stranger
much
as
it
is
against
my
principles
to
employ
brute
force
you
must
stay
and
be
properly
dematerialized
alive
or
dead
science
demands
it
as
he
spoke
he
started
to
draw
his
automatic
pistol
being
in
form
he
drew
slowly
as
crane
did
and
seaton
with
the
dexterity
of
much
work
and
of
years
of
familiarity
with
his
weapon
drew
and
fired
in
one
incredibly
rapid
movement
before
the
other
had
withdrawn
the
pistol
from
his
pocket
the
shell
completely
volatilized
the
stranger
and
hurled
the
party
backward
toward
the
skylark
into
which
they
fled
hastily
as
crane
the
last
one
to
enter
the
vessel
fired
his
pistol
and
closed
the
massive
door
seaton
leaped
to
the
levers
as
he
did
so
he
saw
a
creature
materialize
in
the
air
of
the
vessel
and
fall
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
as
he
threw
on
the
power
it
was
a
frightful
thing
like
nothing
ever
before
seen
upon
any
world
with
great
teeth
long
sharp
claws
and
an
automatic
pistol
clutched
firmly
in
a
human
hand
forced
flat
by
the
terrific
acceleration
of
the
vessel
it
was
unable
to
lift
either
itself
or
the
weapon
and
lay
helpless
we
take
one
trick
anyway
blazed
seaton
as
he
threw
on
the
power
of
the
attractor
and
diffused
its
force
into
a
screen
over
the
party
so
that
the
enemy
could
not
materialize
in
the
air
above
them
and
crush
them
by
mere
weight
as
pure
mental
force
you
entirely
out
of
my
class
but
when
you
come
down
to
matter
which
i
can
understand
give
you
a
run
for
your
money
until
my
angles
catch
fire
that
is
a
childish
defiance
it
speaks
well
for
your
courage
but
ill
for
your
intelligence
the
animal
said
and
vanished
a
moment
later
seaton
hair
almost
stood
on
end
as
he
saw
an
automatic
pistol
appear
upon
the
board
directly
in
front
of
him
clamped
to
it
by
bands
of
steel
paralyzed
by
this
demonstration
of
the
mastery
of
mind
over
matter
unable
to
move
a
muscle
he
lay
helpless
staring
at
the
engine
of
death
in
front
of
him
although
the
whole
proceeding
occupied
only
a
fraction
of
a
second
it
seemed
to
seaton
as
though
he
watched
the
weapon
for
hours
as
the
sleeve
drew
back
cocking
the
pistol
and
throwing
a
cartridge
into
the
chamber
the
trigger
moved
and
the
hammer
descended
to
speed
on
its
way
the
bullet
which
was
to
blot
out
his
life
there
was
a
sharp
click
as
the
hammer
fell
seaton
was
surprised
to
find
himself
still
alive
until
a
voice
spoke
apparently
from
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
with
the
harsh
sound
of
a
metallic
diaphragm
i
was
almost
certain
that
it
would
explode
the
stranger
said
chattily
you
see
i
have
derived
that
formula
yet
so
i
make
a
real
explosive
i
could
of
course
materialize
beside
you
under
your
protective
screen
and
crush
you
in
a
vise
i
could
materialize
as
a
man
of
metal
able
to
stand
up
under
this
acceleration
and
do
you
to
death
i
could
even
by
a
sufficient
expenditure
of
mental
energy
materialize
a
planet
around
your
ship
and
crush
it
however
these
crude
methods
are
distasteful
in
the
extreme
especially
since
you
have
already
given
me
some
slight
and
unexpected
mental
exercise
in
return
i
shall
give
you
one
chance
for
your
lives
i
can
not
dematerialize
either
you
or
your
vessel
until
i
work
out
the
formula
for
your
peculiar
atomic
structure
if
i
can
derive
the
formula
before
you
reach
the
boundaries
of
my
beyond
which
i
can
not
go
i
shall
let
you
go
free
deriving
the
formula
will
be
a
neat
little
problem
it
should
be
fairly
easy
as
it
involves
only
a
simple
integration
in
dimensions
silence
ensued
and
seaton
advanced
his
lever
to
the
limit
of
his
ability
to
retain
consciousness
almost
overcome
by
the
horror
of
their
position
in
an
agony
of
suspense
expecting
every
instant
to
be
hurled
into
nothingness
he
battled
on
with
no
thought
of
yielding
even
in
the
face
of
those
overwhelming
mental
odds
you
ca
do
it
old
top
he
thought
savagely
concentrating
all
the
power
of
his
mind
against
the
intellectual
monster
you
ca
dematerialize
us
and
you
ca
integrate
above
dimensions
to
save
your
neck
you
ca
do
it
you
slipping
all
balled
up
right
now
for
more
than
an
hour
the
silent
battle
raged
during
which
time
the
skylark
flew
millions
upon
millions
of
miles
toward
earth
finally
the
stranger
spoke
again
you
three
win
it
said
abruptly
in
answer
to
the
unspoken
surprise
of
all
three
men
it
went
on
yes
all
three
of
you
got
the
same
idea
and
crane
even
forced
his
body
to
retain
consciousness
to
fight
me
your
efforts
were
very
feeble
of
course
but
were
enough
to
interrupt
my
calculations
at
a
delicate
stage
every
time
you
are
a
low
form
of
life
undoubtedly
but
with
more
mentality
than
i
supposed
at
first
i
could
get
that
formula
of
course
in
spite
of
you
if
i
had
time
but
we
are
rapidly
approaching
the
limits
of
my
territory
outside
of
which
even
i
could
not
think
my
way
back
that
is
one
thing
in
which
your
mechanical
devices
are
superior
to
anything
my
own
race
developed
before
we
became
pure
intellectuals
they
point
the
way
back
to
your
earth
which
is
so
far
away
that
even
my
mentality
can
not
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
distance
i
can
understand
the
earth
can
visualize
it
from
your
minds
but
i
can
not
project
myself
any
nearer
to
it
than
we
are
at
present
before
i
leave
you
i
will
say
that
you
have
conferred
a
real
favor
upon
me
you
have
given
me
something
to
think
about
for
thousands
of
cycles
to
come
assured
that
their
visitor
had
really
gone
seaton
reduced
the
power
to
that
of
gravity
and
dorothy
soon
sat
up
margaret
reviving
more
slowly
dick
said
dorothy
solemnly
did
that
happen
or
have
i
been
unconscious
and
just
had
a
nightmare
it
happened
all
right
returned
her
lover
wiping
his
brow
in
relief
see
that
pistol
clamped
upon
the
top
of
the
board
that
a
token
in
remembrance
of
him
dorothy
though
she
had
been
only
half
conscious
had
heard
the
words
of
the
stranger
as
she
looked
at
the
faces
of
the
men
white
and
drawn
with
the
mental
struggle
she
realized
what
they
had
gone
through
and
she
drew
seaton
down
into
one
of
the
seats
stroking
his
hair
tenderly
margaret
went
to
her
room
immediately
and
as
she
did
not
return
dorothy
followed
she
came
back
presently
with
a
look
of
concern
upon
her
face
this
life
is
a
little
hard
on
peggy
i
did
realize
how
much
harder
for
her
it
would
be
than
it
is
for
me
until
i
went
in
there
and
found
her
crying
it
is
much
harder
for
her
of
course
since
i
am
with
you
dick
and
with
you
martin
whom
i
know
so
well
she
must
feel
terribly
alone
why
should
she
demanded
seaton
we
think
she
some
game
little
guy
why
she
one
of
the
bunch
she
must
know
that
well
it
is
the
same
insisted
dorothy
you
be
extra
nice
to
her
dick
but
do
you
dare
let
her
know
i
told
you
about
the
tears
or
she
eat
me
alive
crane
said
nothing
a
not
unusual
occurrence
but
his
face
grew
thoughtful
and
his
manner
when
margaret
appeared
at
mealtime
was
more
solicitous
than
usual
and
more
than
brotherly
in
its
tenderness
i
shall
be
an
interstellar
diplomat
dorothy
whispered
to
seaton
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
was
that
a
beautiful
bee
i
put
upon
martin
seaton
stared
at
her
a
moment
then
shook
her
gently
before
he
took
her
into
his
arms
the
information
however
did
not
prevent
him
from
calling
to
crane
a
few
minutes
later
even
though
he
was
still
deep
in
conversation
with
margaret
dorothy
gave
him
an
exasperated
glance
and
walked
away
i
sure
pulled
a
boner
that
time
seaton
muttered
as
he
plucked
at
his
hair
ruefully
it
nearly
did
us
let
test
this
stuff
out
and
see
if
it
x
mart
while
duquesne
out
of
the
way
if
it
is
x
it
some
find
seaton
cut
off
a
bit
of
metal
with
his
knife
hammered
it
into
a
small
piece
of
copper
and
threw
the
copper
into
the
out
of
contact
with
the
plating
as
the
metal
received
the
current
the
vessel
started
slightly
it
x
mart
we
got
enough
of
this
stuff
to
supply
three
worlds
better
put
it
away
somewhere
suggested
crane
and
after
the
metal
had
been
removed
to
seaton
cabin
the
two
men
again
sought
a
almost
in
their
line
of
flight
they
saw
a
close
cluster
of
stars
each
emitting
a
peculiar
greenish
light
which
in
the
spectroscope
revealed
a
blaze
of
copper
lines
that
our
meat
martin
we
ought
to
be
able
to
grab
some
copper
in
that
system
where
there
so
much
of
it
that
it
colors
their
sunlight
the
copper
is
undoubtedly
there
but
it
might
be
too
dangerous
to
get
so
close
to
so
many
suns
we
may
have
trouble
getting
away
well
our
copper
getting
horribly
low
we
got
to
find
some
pretty
quick
somewhere
or
else
walk
back
home
and
there
our
best
chance
we
feel
our
way
along
if
it
gets
too
strong
we
beat
it
when
they
had
approached
so
close
that
the
suns
were
great
stars
widely
spaced
in
the
heavens
crane
relinquished
the
controls
to
seaton
if
you
will
take
the
lever
awhile
dick
margaret
and
i
will
go
downstairs
and
see
if
we
can
locate
a
planet
after
a
glance
through
the
telescope
crane
knew
that
they
were
still
too
far
from
the
group
of
suns
to
place
any
planet
with
certainty
and
began
taking
notes
his
mind
was
not
upon
his
work
however
but
was
completely
filled
with
thoughts
of
the
girl
at
his
side
the
intervals
between
his
comments
became
longer
and
longer
until
they
were
standing
in
silence
both
staring
with
unseeing
eyes
out
into
the
trackless
void
but
it
was
in
no
sense
their
usual
companionable
silence
crane
was
fighting
back
the
words
he
longed
to
say
this
lovely
girl
was
not
here
of
her
own
accord
she
had
been
torn
forcibly
from
her
home
and
from
her
friends
and
he
would
not
could
not
make
her
already
difficult
position
even
more
unpleasant
by
forcing
his
attentions
upon
her
margaret
sensed
something
unusual
and
significant
in
his
attitude
and
held
herself
tense
her
heart
beating
wildly
at
that
moment
an
asteroid
came
within
range
of
the
skylark
watchful
repeller
and
at
the
lurch
of
the
vessel
as
it
swung
around
the
obstruction
margaret
would
have
fallen
had
not
crane
instinctively
caught
her
with
one
arm
ordinarily
this
bit
of
courtesy
would
have
gone
unnoticed
by
both
as
it
had
happened
many
times
before
but
in
that
atmosphere
it
took
on
a
new
significance
both
blushed
hotly
and
as
their
eyes
met
each
saw
that
which
held
them
spellbound
slowly
almost
as
if
without
volition
crane
put
his
other
arm
around
her
a
wave
of
deeper
crimson
swept
over
her
face
and
she
bent
her
handsome
head
as
her
slender
body
yielded
to
his
arms
with
no
effort
to
free
itself
finally
crane
spoke
his
usually
even
voice
faltering
margaret
i
hope
you
will
not
think
this
unfair
of
me
but
we
have
been
through
so
much
together
that
i
feel
as
though
we
had
known
each
other
forever
until
we
went
through
this
last
experience
i
had
intended
to
wait
but
why
should
we
wait
life
is
not
lived
in
years
alone
and
you
know
how
much
i
love
you
my
dearest
he
finished
passionately
her
arms
crept
up
around
his
neck
her
bowed
head
lifted
and
her
eyes
looked
deep
into
his
as
she
whispered
her
answer
i
think
i
do
oh
martin
presently
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
keeping
the
singing
joy
in
their
hearts
inaudible
and
the
kisses
fresh
upon
their
lips
invisible
they
might
have
kept
their
secret
for
a
time
had
not
seaton
promptly
asked
well
what
did
you
find
mart
a
panicky
look
appeared
upon
crane
countenance
and
margaret
fair
face
glowed
like
a
peony
what
you
find
demanded
dorothy
as
she
noticed
their
confusion
my
future
wife
crane
answered
steadily
the
two
girls
rushed
into
each
other
arms
and
the
two
men
silently
gripped
hands
in
a
clasp
of
steel
for
each
of
the
four
knew
that
these
two
unions
were
not
passing
fancies
lightly
entered
into
and
as
lightly
cast
aside
but
were
true
partnerships
which
would
endure
throughout
the
entire
span
of
life
a
planet
was
located
and
the
skylark
flew
toward
it
discovering
that
it
was
apparently
situated
in
the
center
of
the
cluster
of
suns
they
hesitated
but
finding
that
there
was
no
dangerous
force
present
they
kept
on
as
they
drew
nearer
so
that
the
planet
appeared
as
a
very
small
moon
they
saw
that
the
skylark
was
in
a
blaze
of
green
light
and
looking
out
of
the
windows
crane
counted
seventeen
great
suns
scattered
in
all
directions
in
the
sky
slowing
down
abruptly
as
the
planet
was
approached
seaton
dropped
the
vessel
slowly
through
the
atmosphere
while
crane
and
duquesne
tested
and
analyzed
it
pressure
thirty
pounds
per
square
inch
surface
gravity
as
compared
to
that
of
the
earth
about
double
that
of
the
earth
while
a
weight
weighs
only
two
pounds
a
peculiar
combination
reported
crane
and
duquesne
added
analysis
about
the
same
as
our
air
except
for
two
and
per
cent
of
a
gas
that
is
poisonous
and
which
has
a
peculiar
fragrant
odor
i
ca
analyze
it
and
think
it
probably
an
element
unknown
upon
earth
or
at
least
very
rare
it
would
have
to
be
rare
if
you
do
know
what
it
is
acknowledged
seaton
locking
the
skylark
in
place
and
going
over
to
smell
the
strange
gas
deciding
that
the
air
was
satisfactory
the
pressure
inside
the
vessel
was
slowly
raised
to
the
value
of
that
outside
and
two
doors
were
opened
to
allow
the
new
atmosphere
free
circulation
seaton
shut
off
the
power
actuating
the
repeller
and
let
the
vessel
settle
slowly
toward
the
ocean
which
was
directly
beneath
them
an
ocean
of
a
deep
intense
wondrously
beautiful
blue
which
the
scientists
studied
with
interest
arrived
at
the
surface
seaton
moistened
a
rod
in
a
wave
and
tasted
it
cautiously
then
uttered
a
yell
of
joy
a
yell
broken
off
abruptly
as
he
heard
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
both
girls
started
as
the
vibrations
set
up
in
the
dense
air
smote
upon
their
eardrums
seaton
moderated
his
voice
and
continued
i
forgot
about
the
but
hurrah
for
this
ocean
ammoniacal
copper
sulphate
solution
we
can
sure
get
all
the
copper
we
want
right
here
but
it
would
take
weeks
to
evaporate
the
water
and
recover
the
metal
we
can
probably
get
it
easier
ashore
let
go
they
started
off
just
above
the
surface
of
the
ocean
toward
the
nearest
continent
which
they
had
observed
from
the
air
chapter
xiii
nalboon
of
mardonale
as
the
skylark
approached
the
shore
its
occupants
heard
a
rapid
succession
of
heavy
detonations
apparently
coming
from
the
direction
in
which
they
were
traveling
wonder
what
that
racket
is
asked
seaton
it
sounds
like
big
guns
said
crane
and
duquesne
nodded
agreement
big
guns
is
right
they
shooting
high
explosive
shells
too
or
i
never
heard
any
even
allowing
for
the
density
of
the
air
that
kind
of
noise
is
made
by
let
go
see
what
doing
and
seaton
started
to
walk
toward
one
of
the
windows
with
his
free
swinging
stride
instantly
he
was
the
effort
necessary
to
carry
his
weight
upon
the
earth
surface
lifting
him
into
the
air
in
a
succession
of
ludicrous
hops
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
and
walked
normally
i
forgot
this
gravity
stuff
he
laughed
walk
as
though
we
had
only
a
notch
of
power
on
and
it
goes
all
right
it
sure
is
funny
to
feel
so
light
when
we
so
close
to
the
ground
he
closed
the
doors
to
keep
out
a
part
of
the
noise
and
advanced
the
speed
lever
a
little
so
that
the
vessel
tilted
sharply
under
the
pull
of
the
almost
horizontal
bar
go
easy
cautioned
crane
we
do
not
want
to
get
in
the
way
of
one
of
their
shells
they
may
be
of
a
different
kind
than
those
we
are
familiar
with
right
easy
it
is
we
stay
forty
miles
above
them
if
necessary
as
the
great
speed
of
the
ship
rapidly
lessened
the
distance
the
sound
grew
heavier
and
clearer
like
one
continuous
explosion
so
closely
did
one
deafening
concussion
follow
another
that
the
ear
could
not
distinguish
the
separate
reports
i
see
them
simultaneously
announced
crane
who
was
seated
at
one
of
the
forward
windows
searching
the
country
with
his
binoculars
and
seaton
who
from
the
pilot
seat
could
see
in
any
direction
the
others
hurried
to
the
windows
with
their
glasses
and
saw
an
astonishing
sight
aerial
battleships
eight
of
exclaimed
seaton
as
big
as
the
idaho
four
of
are
about
the
same
shape
as
our
battleships
no
wings
they
act
like
helicopters
four
of
them
are
battleships
right
enough
but
what
about
the
other
four
asked
duquesne
they
are
not
ships
or
planes
or
anything
else
that
i
ever
heard
of
they
are
animals
asserted
crane
machines
never
were
and
never
will
be
built
like
that
as
the
skylark
cautiously
approached
it
was
evident
to
the
watchers
that
four
of
the
contestants
were
undoubtedly
animals
here
indeed
was
a
new
kind
of
animal
an
animal
able
to
fight
on
even
terms
with
a
battleship
frightful
aerial
monsters
they
were
each
had
an
enormous
body
with
scores
of
prodigiously
long
tentacles
like
those
of
a
and
a
dozen
or
more
great
soaring
wings
even
at
that
distance
they
could
see
the
row
of
protruding
eyes
along
the
side
of
each
monstrous
body
and
the
terrible
beaks
tearing
through
the
metal
of
the
warships
opposing
them
they
could
see
by
the
reflection
of
the
light
from
the
many
suns
that
each
monster
was
apparently
covered
by
scales
and
joints
of
some
transparent
armor
that
it
was
real
and
highly
effective
armor
there
could
be
no
doubt
for
each
battleship
bristled
with
guns
of
heavy
caliber
and
each
gun
was
vomiting
forth
a
continuous
stream
of
fire
shells
bursting
against
each
of
the
creatures
made
one
continuous
blaze
and
the
uproar
was
indescribable
an
uninterrupted
cataclysm
of
sound
appalling
in
its
intensity
the
battle
was
brief
soon
all
four
of
the
battleships
had
crumpled
to
the
ground
their
crews
absorbed
by
the
terrible
sucking
arms
or
devoured
by
the
frightful
beaks
they
did
not
die
in
vain
three
of
the
monsters
had
been
blown
to
atoms
by
shells
which
had
apparently
penetrated
their
armor
the
fourth
was
pursuing
something
which
seaton
now
saw
was
a
fleet
of
small
airships
which
had
flown
away
from
the
scene
of
conflict
swift
as
they
were
the
monster
covered
three
feet
to
their
one
we
ca
stand
for
anything
like
that
cried
seaton
as
he
threw
on
the
power
and
the
skylark
leaped
ahead
get
ready
to
bump
him
off
mart
when
i
jerk
him
away
he
acts
so
give
him
a
real
one
fifty
milligrams
sweeping
on
with
awful
speed
the
monster
seized
the
largest
and
most
gaily
decorated
plane
in
his
tentacles
just
as
the
skylark
came
within
sighting
distance
in
four
practically
simultaneous
movements
seaton
sighted
the
attractor
at
the
ugly
beak
released
all
its
power
pointed
the
main
bar
of
the
skylark
directly
upward
and
advanced
his
speed
lever
there
was
a
crash
of
rending
metal
as
the
thing
was
torn
loose
from
the
plane
and
jerked
a
hundred
miles
into
the
air
struggling
so
savagely
in
that
invisible
and
incomprehensible
grip
that
the
mass
of
the
skylark
tossed
and
pitched
like
a
child
plaything
those
inside
her
heard
the
sharp
spiteful
crack
of
the
and
an
instant
later
they
heard
a
report
that
paralyzed
their
senses
even
inside
the
vessel
and
in
the
thin
air
of
their
enormous
elevation
as
the
largest
bullet
prepared
by
the
inventors
struck
full
upon
the
side
of
the
hideous
body
there
was
no
smoke
no
gas
or
vapor
of
any
kind
only
a
huge
volume
of
intolerable
flame
as
the
energy
stored
within
the
atoms
of
copper
instantaneously
liberated
heated
to
incandescence
and
beyond
all
the
atmosphere
within
a
radius
of
hundreds
of
feet
the
monster
disappeared
utterly
and
seaton
with
unerring
hand
reversed
the
bar
and
darted
back
down
toward
the
fleet
of
airships
he
reached
them
in
time
to
focus
the
attractor
upon
the
wrecked
and
helpless
plane
in
the
middle
of
its
fall
and
lowered
it
gently
to
the
ground
surrounded
by
the
fleet
the
skylark
landed
easily
beside
the
wrecked
machine
and
the
wanderers
saw
that
their
vessel
was
completely
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
people
men
and
women
identical
in
form
and
feature
with
themselves
they
were
a
superbly
molded
race
the
men
fully
as
large
as
seaton
and
duquesne
the
women
while
smaller
than
the
men
were
noticeably
taller
than
the
two
women
in
the
car
the
men
wore
broad
collars
of
metal
numerous
metallic
ornaments
and
leather
belts
and
which
were
hung
with
weapons
of
peculiar
patterns
the
women
carried
no
weapons
but
were
even
more
highly
decorated
than
were
the
men
each
slender
body
scintillated
with
the
brilliance
of
hundreds
of
strange
gems
flashing
points
of
fire
jeweled
bands
of
metal
and
leather
restrained
their
hair
jeweled
collars
encircled
their
throats
jeweled
belts
jeweled
bracelets
jeweled
anklets
each
added
its
quota
of
brilliance
to
the
glittering
whole
the
strangers
wore
no
clothing
and
their
smooth
skins
shone
a
dark
livid
utterly
indescribable
color
in
the
peculiar
unearthly
glare
of
the
light
green
their
skins
undoubtedly
were
but
not
any
shade
of
green
visible
in
the
earthly
spectrum
the
whites
of
their
eyes
were
a
light
the
heavy
hair
of
the
women
and
the
locks
of
the
men
were
green
as
well
a
green
so
dark
as
to
be
almost
black
as
were
also
their
eyes
well
what
know
about
that
pondered
seaton
dazedly
human
right
enough
but
ye
gods
what
a
color
it
is
hard
to
tell
how
much
of
that
color
is
real
and
how
much
of
it
is
due
to
this
light
answered
crane
wait
until
you
get
outside
away
from
our
daylight
lamps
and
you
will
probably
look
like
a
chinese
puzzle
as
to
the
form
it
is
logical
to
suppose
that
wherever
conditions
are
similar
to
those
upon
the
earth
and
the
age
is
anywhere
nearly
the
same
development
would
be
along
the
same
lines
as
with
us
that
right
too
dottie
your
hair
will
sure
look
gorgeous
in
this
light
let
go
out
and
give
the
natives
a
treat
i
would
look
like
that
for
a
million
dollars
retorted
dorothy
and
if
i
going
to
look
like
that
i
wo
get
out
of
the
ship
so
there
cheer
up
dottie
you
wo
look
like
that
your
hair
will
be
black
in
this
light
then
what
color
will
mine
be
asked
margaret
seaton
glanced
at
her
black
hair
probably
a
very
dark
and
beautiful
green
he
grinned
his
gray
eyes
sparkling
but
we
have
to
wait
and
see
friends
and
i
got
a
hunch
that
this
is
going
to
be
some
visit
how
about
it
shall
we
go
ahead
with
it
dorothy
went
up
to
him
her
face
bright
with
eagerness
oh
what
a
lark
let
go
even
in
duquesne
cold
presence
margaret
eyes
sought
those
of
her
lover
and
his
sleeve
barely
touching
her
arm
was
enough
to
send
a
dancing
thrill
along
it
onward
men
of
earth
she
cried
and
seaton
stepping
up
to
the
window
rapped
sharply
upon
the
glass
with
the
butt
of
his
pistol
and
raised
both
hands
high
above
his
head
in
the
universal
sign
of
peace
in
response
a
man
of
herculean
mold
so
splendidly
decorated
that
his
harness
was
one
blazing
mass
of
jewels
waved
his
arm
and
shouted
a
command
the
crowd
promptly
fell
back
leaving
a
clear
space
of
several
hundred
yards
the
man
evidently
one
in
high
command
unbuckled
his
harness
dropping
every
weapon
and
advanced
toward
the
skylark
both
arms
upraised
in
seaton
gesture
seaton
went
to
the
door
and
started
to
open
it
better
talk
to
him
from
inside
cautioned
crane
i
do
think
so
mart
he
peaceable
and
i
got
my
gun
in
my
pocket
since
he
does
know
what
clothes
are
he
think
i
unarmed
which
is
as
it
should
be
and
if
he
shows
fight
it
wo
take
more
than
a
week
for
me
to
get
into
action
all
right
go
on
duquesne
and
i
will
come
along
absolutely
not
he
alone
so
i
got
to
be
i
notice
that
some
of
his
men
are
covering
us
though
you
might
do
the
same
for
them
with
a
couple
of
the
machine
guns
seaton
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
went
to
meet
the
stranger
when
they
had
approached
to
within
a
few
feet
of
each
other
the
stranger
stopped
he
flexed
his
left
arm
smartly
so
that
the
touched
his
left
ear
and
smiled
broadly
exposing
a
row
of
splendid
shining
green
teeth
then
he
spoke
a
meaningless
jumble
of
sounds
his
voice
though
light
and
thin
nevertheless
seemed
to
be
of
powerful
timbre
seaton
smiled
in
return
and
saluted
hello
chief
i
get
your
idea
all
right
and
we
glad
peaceable
but
your
language
does
mean
a
thing
in
my
young
life
the
chief
tapped
himself
upon
the
chest
saying
distinctly
and
impressively
nalboon
nalboon
repeated
seaton
and
added
pointing
to
himself
seaton
see
tin
answered
the
stranger
and
again
indicating
himself
domak
gok
mardonale
that
must
be
his
title
thought
seaton
rapidly
have
to
give
myself
one
i
guess
boss
of
the
road
he
replied
drawing
himself
up
with
pride
the
introduction
made
nalboon
pointed
to
the
wrecked
plane
inclined
his
head
in
thanks
and
turned
to
his
people
with
one
arm
upraised
shouting
an
order
in
which
seaton
could
distinguish
something
that
sounded
like
see
tin
bass
uvvy
rood
instantly
every
right
arm
in
the
assemblage
was
aloft
that
of
each
man
bearing
a
weapon
while
the
left
arms
snapped
into
the
peculiar
salute
and
a
mighty
cry
arose
as
all
repeated
the
name
and
title
of
the
distinguished
visitor
seaton
turned
to
the
skylark
motioning
to
crane
to
open
the
door
bring
out
one
of
those
big
signal
rockets
mart
he
called
they
giving
us
a
royal
reception
let
acknowledge
it
right
the
party
appeared
crane
carrying
the
huge
rocket
with
an
air
of
deference
as
they
approached
seaton
shrugged
one
shoulder
and
his
appeared
in
his
hand
nalboon
started
and
in
spite
of
his
utmost
efforts
at
he
glanced
at
it
in
surprise
the
case
flew
open
and
seaton
taking
a
cigarette
extended
the
case
smoke
he
asked
affably
the
other
took
one
but
showed
plainly
that
he
had
no
idea
of
the
use
to
which
it
was
to
be
put
this
astonishment
of
the
stranger
at
a
simple
feat
and
his
apparent
ignorance
of
tobacco
emboldened
seaton
reaching
into
his
mouth
he
pulled
out
a
flaming
match
at
which
nalboon
started
violently
while
all
the
natives
watched
in
amazement
seaton
lighted
the
cigarette
and
after
half
consuming
it
in
two
long
inhalations
he
apparently
swallowed
the
remainder
only
to
bring
it
to
light
again
having
smoked
it
he
apparently
swallowed
the
butt
with
evident
relish
they
do
know
anything
about
matches
or
smoking
he
said
turning
to
crane
this
rocket
will
tie
them
up
in
a
knot
step
back
everybody
he
bowed
deeply
to
nalboon
pulling
a
lighted
match
from
his
ear
as
he
did
so
and
lighted
the
fuse
there
was
a
roar
a
shower
of
sparks
a
blaze
of
colored
fire
as
the
great
rocket
flew
upward
but
to
surprise
nalboon
took
it
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
saluting
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
courtesy
seaton
motioned
to
his
party
to
approach
and
turned
to
crane
better
not
dick
let
him
think
that
you
are
the
king
of
everything
in
sight
not
on
your
life
if
he
is
one
king
we
are
two
and
he
introduced
crane
with
great
ceremony
to
the
domak
as
the
boss
of
the
skylark
at
which
the
salute
by
his
people
was
repeated
nalboon
then
shouted
an
order
and
a
company
of
soldiers
led
by
an
officer
came
toward
them
surrounding
a
small
group
of
people
apparently
prisoners
these
captives
seven
men
and
seven
women
were
much
lighter
in
color
than
the
rest
of
the
gathering
having
skins
of
a
ghastly
pale
shade
practically
the
same
color
as
the
whites
of
their
eyes
in
other
bodily
aspects
they
were
the
same
as
their
captors
in
appearance
save
that
they
were
entirely
naked
except
for
the
jeweled
metal
collars
worn
by
all
and
a
massive
metal
belt
worn
by
one
man
they
walked
with
a
proud
and
lofty
carriage
scorn
for
their
captors
in
every
step
nalboon
barked
an
order
to
the
prisoners
they
stared
in
defiance
motionless
until
the
man
wearing
the
belt
who
had
studied
seaton
closely
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
when
they
all
prostrated
themselves
nalboon
then
waved
his
hand
giving
the
whole
group
to
seaton
as
slaves
seaton
with
no
sign
of
his
surprise
thanked
the
giver
and
motioned
his
slaves
to
rise
they
obeyed
and
placed
themselves
behind
the
party
two
men
and
two
women
behind
seaton
and
the
same
number
behind
crane
one
man
and
one
woman
behind
each
of
the
others
seaton
then
tried
to
make
nalboon
understand
that
they
wanted
copper
pointing
to
his
anklet
the
only
copper
in
sight
the
chief
instantly
removed
the
trinket
and
handed
it
to
seaton
who
knowing
by
the
gasp
of
surprise
of
the
guard
that
it
was
some
powerful
symbol
returned
it
with
profuse
apologies
after
trying
in
vain
to
make
the
other
understand
what
he
wanted
he
led
him
into
the
skylark
and
showed
him
the
remnant
of
the
he
showed
him
its
original
size
and
indicated
the
desired
number
by
counting
to
sixteen
upon
his
fingers
nalboon
nodded
his
comprehension
and
going
outside
pointed
upward
toward
the
largest
of
the
eleven
suns
visible
motioning
its
rising
and
setting
four
times
he
then
invited
the
visitors
in
unmistakable
sign
language
to
accompany
him
as
guests
of
honor
but
seaton
refused
lead
on
macduff
we
follow
he
replied
explaining
his
meaning
by
signs
as
they
turned
to
enter
the
vessel
the
slaves
followed
closely
until
crane
remonstrated
we
do
want
them
aboard
do
we
dick
there
are
too
many
of
them
all
right
seaton
replied
and
waved
them
away
as
they
stepped
back
the
guard
seized
the
nearest
a
woman
and
forced
her
to
her
knees
while
a
man
adorned
with
a
necklace
of
green
human
teeth
and
carrying
a
shining
broadsword
prepared
to
decapitate
her
we
must
take
them
with
us
i
see
said
crane
as
he
brushed
the
guards
aside
followed
by
the
slaves
the
party
entered
the
skylark
and
the
dark
green
people
embarked
in
their
airplanes
and
helicopters
nalboon
rode
in
a
large
and
plane
which
led
the
fleet
at
its
full
speed
of
six
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
skylark
taking
a
placing
a
few
hundred
yards
above
the
flagship
i
do
get
these
folks
at
all
mart
said
seaton
after
a
silence
they
have
machines
far
ahead
of
anything
we
have
on
earth
and
big
guns
that
shoot
as
fast
as
and
yet
are
scared
to
death
at
a
little
simple
they
do
seem
to
understand
matches
at
all
and
yet
treat
as
an
occurrence
we
will
have
to
wait
until
we
know
them
better
replied
crane
and
duquesne
added
from
what
i
have
seen
their
power
seems
to
be
all
electrical
perhaps
they
are
up
with
us
in
chemistry
even
though
they
are
ahead
of
us
in
mechanics
flying
above
a
broad
but
rapid
and
turbulent
stream
the
fleet
soon
neared
a
large
city
and
the
visitors
from
earth
gazed
with
interest
at
this
metropolis
of
the
unknown
world
the
buildings
were
all
the
same
height
and
arranged
in
squares
very
much
as
our
cities
are
arranged
there
were
no
streets
the
spaces
between
the
buildings
being
areas
evidently
laid
out
for
recreation
amusement
and
sport
there
was
no
need
for
streets
all
traffic
was
in
the
air
the
air
seemed
full
of
flying
vehicles
darting
in
all
directions
but
it
was
soon
evident
that
there
was
exact
order
in
the
apparent
confusion
each
class
of
vessel
and
each
direction
of
traffic
having
its
own
level
eagerly
the
three
men
studied
the
craft
which
ranged
in
size
from
helicopters
little
more
than
single
chairs
flying
about
in
the
air
up
to
tremendous
multiplane
freighters
capable
of
carrying
thousands
of
tons
flying
high
over
the
city
to
avoid
its
congested
the
fleet
descended
toward
an
immense
building
just
outside
the
city
proper
and
all
landed
upon
its
roof
save
the
flagship
which
led
the
skylark
to
a
nearby
a
massive
pile
of
metal
and
stone
upon
which
nalboon
and
his
retinue
stood
to
welcome
the
guests
after
seaton
had
anchored
the
vessel
immovably
by
means
of
the
attractor
the
party
disembarked
seaton
remarking
with
a
grin
do
be
surprised
at
anything
i
do
folks
i
a
walking
storehouse
of
junk
of
all
kinds
so
that
if
occasion
arises
i
can
put
on
a
real
exhibition
as
they
turned
toward
their
host
a
soldier
in
his
eagerness
to
see
the
strangers
jostled
another
without
a
word
two
keen
swords
flew
from
their
scabbards
and
a
duel
to
the
death
ensued
the
visitors
stared
in
amazement
but
no
one
else
paid
any
attention
to
the
combat
which
was
soon
over
the
victor
turning
away
from
the
body
of
his
opponent
and
resuming
his
place
without
creating
a
ripple
of
interest
nalboon
led
the
way
into
an
elevator
which
dropped
rapidly
to
the
level
massive
gates
were
thrown
open
and
through
ranks
of
people
prostrate
upon
their
faces
the
party
went
out
into
the
palace
grounds
of
the
domak
or
emperor
of
the
great
nation
of
mardonale
never
before
had
earthly
eyes
rested
upon
such
scenes
of
splendor
every
color
and
gradation
of
their
peculiar
spectrum
was
present
in
solid
liquid
and
gas
the
trees
were
all
colors
of
the
rainbow
as
were
the
grasses
and
flowers
along
the
walks
the
fountains
played
streams
of
many
and
hues
and
even
the
air
was
tinted
and
perfumed
swirling
through
metal
arches
in
billows
of
colors
and
scents
colors
and
combinations
of
colors
impossible
to
describe
were
upon
every
hand
fantastically
beautiful
in
that
peculiar
livid
light
diamonds
and
rubies
their
colors
so
distorted
by
the
green
radiance
as
to
be
almost
unrecognizable
emeralds
glowing
with
an
intense
green
impossible
in
earthly
light
together
with
strange
gems
peculiar
to
this
strange
world
sparkled
and
flashed
from
railings
statues
and
pedestals
throughout
the
ground
is
this
gorgeous
dick
whispered
dorothy
but
what
do
i
look
like
i
wish
i
had
a
mirror
you
look
simply
awful
do
i
look
like
you
do
not
being
able
to
see
myself
i
ca
say
but
i
imagine
you
do
you
look
as
you
would
under
a
photographer
arc
lamps
only
worse
the
colors
ca
be
described
you
might
as
well
try
to
describe
cerise
to
a
man
born
blind
as
to
try
to
express
these
colors
in
english
but
as
near
as
i
can
come
to
it
your
eyes
are
a
dark
sort
of
purplish
green
with
the
whites
of
your
eyes
and
your
teeth
a
kind
of
plush
green
your
skin
is
a
pale
yellowish
green
except
for
the
pink
of
your
cheeks
which
is
a
kind
of
black
with
orange
and
green
mixed
up
in
it
your
lips
are
black
and
your
hair
is
a
funny
kind
of
color
halfway
between
black
and
old
rose
with
a
little
green
and
heavens
dick
stop
that
enough
choked
dorothy
we
all
look
like
hobgoblins
we
even
worse
than
the
natives
sure
we
are
they
were
born
here
and
are
acclimated
to
it
we
are
strangers
and
are
i
would
like
to
see
what
one
of
these
people
would
look
like
in
washington
nalboon
led
them
into
the
palace
proper
and
into
a
great
dining
hall
where
a
table
was
already
prepared
for
the
entire
party
this
room
was
splendidly
decorated
with
jewels
its
many
windows
being
simply
masses
of
gems
the
walls
were
hung
with
a
cloth
resembling
silk
which
fell
to
the
floor
in
shimmering
waves
of
color
woodwork
there
was
none
doors
panels
tables
and
chairs
were
cunningly
wrought
of
various
metals
seaton
and
duquesne
could
recognize
a
few
of
them
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
unknown
upon
the
earth
and
were
like
the
jewels
and
vegetation
of
this
strange
world
of
many
and
various
peculiar
colors
a
closer
inspection
of
one
of
the
marvelous
tapestries
showed
that
it
also
was
of
metal
its
threads
numbering
thousands
to
the
inch
woven
of
many
different
metals
of
vivid
but
harmonious
colors
in
a
strange
and
intricate
design
it
seemed
to
writhe
as
its
colors
changed
with
every
variation
in
the
color
of
the
light
which
pouring
from
concealed
sources
was
reflected
by
the
metal
and
innumerable
jewels
of
the
lofty
domed
ceiling
oh
is
this
too
perfectly
gorgeous
breathed
dorothy
i
give
anything
for
a
dress
made
out
of
that
stuff
dick
is
common
by
comparison
would
you
dare
wear
it
dottie
asked
margaret
i
i
wear
it
in
a
minute
if
i
could
only
get
it
it
would
take
washington
by
storm
i
try
to
get
a
piece
of
it
then
smiled
seaton
i
see
about
it
while
we
are
getting
the
copper
we
better
be
careful
in
choosing
what
we
eat
here
seaton
suggested
duquesne
as
the
domak
himself
led
them
to
the
table
we
sure
had
with
a
copper
ocean
and
green
teeth
i
should
be
surprised
if
copper
arsenic
and
other
such
trifles
formed
a
regular
part
of
their
diet
the
girls
and
i
will
wait
for
you
two
chemists
to
approve
every
dish
before
we
try
it
then
said
crane
nalboon
placed
his
guests
the
slaves
standing
at
attention
behind
them
and
numerous
servants
carrying
great
trays
appeared
the
servants
were
intermediate
in
color
between
the
light
and
the
dark
races
with
dull
unintelligent
faces
but
quick
and
deft
in
their
movements
the
first
course
a
thin
light
wine
served
in
metal
goblets
was
approved
by
the
chemists
and
the
dinner
was
brought
on
there
were
mighty
joints
of
various
kinds
of
meat
birds
and
fish
both
raw
and
cooked
in
many
ways
green
pink
purple
and
white
vegetables
and
fruits
the
majordomo
held
each
dish
up
to
seaton
for
inspection
the
latter
waving
away
the
fish
and
the
darkest
green
foods
but
approving
the
others
heaping
plates
or
rather
metal
trays
of
food
were
placed
before
the
diners
and
the
attendants
behind
their
chairs
handed
them
peculiar
implements
knives
with
razor
edges
stilettoes
instead
of
forks
and
wide
flexible
spatulas
which
evidently
were
to
serve
the
purposes
of
both
forks
and
spoons
i
simply
ca
eat
with
these
things
exclaimed
dorothy
in
dismay
and
i
do
like
to
drink
soup
out
of
a
can
so
there
that
where
my
lumberjack
training
comes
in
handy
grinned
seaton
with
this
spatula
i
can
eat
faster
than
i
could
with
two
forks
what
do
you
want
girls
forks
or
spoons
or
both
both
please
seaton
reached
out
over
the
table
seizing
forks
and
spoons
from
the
air
and
passing
them
to
the
others
while
the
natives
stared
in
surprise
the
domak
took
a
bowl
filled
with
brilliant
blue
crystals
from
the
sprinkled
his
food
liberally
with
the
substance
and
passed
it
to
seaton
who
looked
at
the
crystals
attentively
copper
sulphate
he
said
to
crane
it
a
good
thing
they
add
it
at
the
table
instead
of
cooking
with
it
or
we
be
out
of
luck
waving
the
copper
sulphate
away
he
again
reached
out
this
time
producing
a
pair
of
small
which
he
passed
to
the
domak
after
he
had
seasoned
the
dishes
before
him
nalboon
tasted
the
pepper
cautiously
and
smiled
in
delight
the
shaker
upon
his
plate
he
then
sprinkled
a
few
grains
of
salt
into
his
palm
stared
at
them
with
an
expression
of
doubting
amazement
and
after
a
few
rapid
sentences
poured
them
into
a
dish
held
by
an
officer
who
had
sprung
to
his
side
the
officer
studied
them
closely
then
carefully
washed
his
chief
hand
nalboon
turned
to
seaton
plainly
asking
for
the
sure
old
top
keep
both
there
lots
more
where
those
came
from
as
he
produced
several
more
sets
in
the
same
mysterious
way
and
handed
them
to
crane
who
in
turn
passed
them
to
the
others
the
meal
progressed
merrily
with
much
conversation
in
the
between
the
two
parties
it
was
evident
that
nalboon
usually
stern
and
reticent
was
in
an
unusually
pleasant
mood
the
viands
though
of
peculiar
flavor
were
in
the
main
pleasing
to
the
palates
of
the
earthly
visitors
this
fruit
salad
or
whatever
it
is
is
divine
remarked
dorothy
after
an
experimental
bite
may
we
eat
as
much
as
we
like
or
had
we
better
just
eat
a
little
go
as
far
as
you
like
returned
her
lover
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
steady
diet
as
i
imagine
everything
contains
copper
and
other
heavy
metals
in
noticeable
amounts
and
probably
considerable
arsenic
but
for
a
few
days
it
ca
very
well
hurt
us
much
after
the
meal
nalboon
bade
them
a
ceremonious
farewell
and
they
were
escorted
to
a
series
of
five
connecting
rooms
by
the
royal
usher
escorted
by
an
entire
company
of
soldiers
who
mounted
guard
outside
the
doors
gathered
in
one
room
they
discussed
sleeping
arrangements
the
girls
insisted
that
they
would
sleep
together
and
that
the
men
should
occupy
the
rooms
at
either
side
as
the
girls
turned
away
the
four
slaves
followed
we
do
want
these
people
and
i
ca
make
them
go
away
cried
dorothy
i
do
want
them
either
replied
seaton
but
if
we
chase
them
out
they
get
their
heads
chopped
off
you
girls
take
the
women
and
take
the
men
seaton
waved
all
the
women
into
the
girls
room
but
they
paused
irresolutely
one
of
them
went
up
to
the
man
wearing
the
metal
belt
evidently
their
leader
and
spoke
to
him
rapidly
as
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
he
shook
his
head
motioning
toward
seaton
several
times
as
he
spoke
to
her
reassuringly
with
his
arm
about
her
tenderly
he
led
her
to
the
door
the
other
women
following
crane
and
duquesne
having
gone
to
their
rooms
with
their
attendants
the
man
wearing
the
belt
drew
the
blinds
and
turned
to
assist
seaton
in
taking
off
his
clothes
i
never
had
a
valet
before
but
go
as
far
as
you
like
if
it
pleases
you
remarked
seaton
as
he
began
to
throw
off
his
clothes
a
multitude
of
small
articles
fell
from
their
in
his
garments
as
he
removed
them
almost
stripped
seaton
stretched
vigorously
the
muscles
writhing
and
rippling
in
great
ridges
under
the
satin
skin
of
his
broad
back
and
mighty
arms
and
shoulders
as
he
filled
his
capacious
lungs
and
twisted
about
working
off
the
stiffness
caused
by
the
days
of
comparative
confinement
the
four
slaves
stared
in
astonishment
at
this
display
of
muscular
development
and
conversed
among
themselves
as
they
gathered
up
seaton
discarded
clothing
their
leader
picked
up
a
a
couple
of
silver
knives
and
forks
and
some
other
articles
and
turned
to
seaton
apparently
asking
permission
to
do
something
with
them
seaton
nodded
assent
carelessly
and
turned
to
his
bed
as
he
did
so
he
heard
a
slight
clank
of
arms
in
the
hall
as
the
guard
was
changed
and
lifting
the
blind
a
trifle
he
saw
that
guards
were
stationed
outside
as
well
as
he
went
to
bed
he
wondered
whether
the
guards
were
guards
of
honor
or
jailers
whether
he
and
his
party
were
honored
guests
or
prisoners
three
of
the
slaves
at
a
word
from
their
chief
threw
themselves
upon
the
floor
and
slept
but
he
himself
did
not
rest
opening
the
apparently
solid
metal
belt
he
took
out
a
great
number
of
small
tools
many
tiny
instruments
and
several
spools
of
insulated
wire
he
then
took
the
articles
seaton
had
given
him
taking
great
pains
not
to
spill
a
single
grain
of
salt
and
set
to
work
hour
after
hour
he
labored
a
strange
exceedingly
complex
instrument
taking
form
under
his
clever
fingers
the
time
you
finish
reading
the
final
instalment
of
the
skylark
of
space
we
are
certain
that
you
will
agree
with
us
that
it
is
one
of
the
outstanding
stories
of
the
decade
an
interplanetarian
story
that
will
not
be
eclipsed
soon
it
will
be
referred
to
by
all
fans
for
years
to
come
it
will
be
read
and
reread
this
is
not
a
mere
prophecy
of
ours
because
we
have
been
deluged
with
letters
since
we
began
publishing
this
story
in
the
closing
chapters
you
will
follow
the
adventures
with
bated
breath
and
you
will
find
that
though
the
two
preceding
instalments
were
and
thought
absorbing
the
final
instalment
eclipses
the
others
a
good
deal
plots
counterplots
and
escapes
mixed
with
love
adventure
and
good
science
seem
to
fairly
tumble
all
over
the
pages
by
the
time
you
finish
this
instalment
you
will
wish
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
story
and
read
it
more
carefully
and
thrill
all
over
chapter
xiv
nalboon
unmasked
after
a
long
sound
sleep
seaton
awoke
and
sprang
out
of
bed
no
sooner
had
he
started
to
shave
however
than
one
of
the
slaves
touched
his
arm
motioning
him
into
a
reclining
chair
and
showing
him
a
keen
blade
long
and
slightly
curved
seaton
lay
down
and
the
slave
shaved
him
with
a
rapidity
and
smoothness
he
had
never
before
experienced
so
wonderfully
sharp
was
the
peculiar
razor
after
seaton
had
dressed
the
barber
started
to
shave
the
chief
slave
without
any
preliminary
treatment
save
rubbing
his
face
with
a
perfumed
oil
hold
on
a
minute
interjected
seaton
who
was
watching
the
process
with
interest
here
something
that
helps
a
lot
he
lathered
the
face
with
his
brush
and
the
man
looked
up
in
surprised
pleasure
as
his
stiff
beard
was
swept
away
without
a
sound
seaton
called
to
the
others
and
soon
the
party
was
assembled
in
his
room
all
dressed
very
lightly
because
of
the
unrelieved
and
unvarying
heat
which
was
constant
at
one
hundred
degrees
a
gong
sounded
and
one
of
the
slaves
opened
the
door
ushering
in
a
party
of
servants
bearing
a
table
ready
set
during
the
meal
seaton
was
greatly
surprised
at
hearing
dorothy
carrying
on
a
halting
conversation
with
one
of
the
women
standing
behind
her
i
knew
that
you
were
a
language
shark
dottie
with
five
or
six
different
ones
to
your
credit
but
i
did
suppose
you
could
learn
to
talk
this
stuff
in
one
day
i
ca
she
replied
but
i
picked
up
a
few
words
of
it
i
can
understand
very
little
of
what
they
are
trying
to
tell
me
the
woman
spoke
rapidly
to
the
man
standing
behind
seaton
and
as
soon
as
the
table
had
been
carried
away
he
asked
permission
to
speak
to
dorothy
fairly
running
across
to
her
he
made
a
slight
obeisance
and
in
eager
tones
poured
forth
such
a
stream
of
language
that
she
held
up
her
hand
to
silence
him
go
slower
please
she
said
and
added
a
couple
of
words
in
his
own
tongue
there
ensued
a
strange
dialogue
with
many
repetitions
and
much
use
of
signs
she
turned
to
seaton
with
a
puzzled
look
i
ca
make
out
all
he
says
dick
but
he
wants
you
to
take
him
into
another
room
of
the
palace
here
to
get
back
something
or
other
that
they
took
from
him
when
they
captured
him
he
ca
go
alone
i
think
he
says
he
will
be
killed
if
he
goes
anywhere
without
you
and
he
says
that
when
you
get
there
you
must
be
sure
not
to
let
the
guards
come
inside
all
right
let
go
and
seaton
motioned
the
man
to
precede
him
as
seaton
started
for
the
door
dorothy
fell
into
step
beside
him
better
stay
back
dottie
i
be
back
in
a
minute
he
said
at
the
door
i
will
not
stay
back
wherever
you
go
i
go
she
replied
in
a
voice
inaudible
to
the
others
i
simply
will
not
stay
away
from
you
a
single
minute
that
i
do
have
to
all
right
little
girl
he
replied
in
the
same
tone
i
do
want
to
be
away
from
you
either
and
i
do
think
that
we
in
any
danger
here
preceded
by
the
chief
slave
and
followed
by
half
a
dozen
others
they
went
out
into
the
hall
no
opposition
was
made
to
their
progress
but
a
full
of
armed
guards
fell
in
around
them
as
an
escort
regarding
seaton
with
looks
composed
of
equal
parts
of
reverence
and
fear
the
slave
led
the
way
rapidly
to
a
room
in
a
distant
wing
of
the
palace
and
opened
the
door
as
seaton
stepped
in
he
saw
that
it
was
evidently
an
or
and
that
it
was
now
entirely
empty
as
the
guard
approached
the
door
seaton
waved
them
back
all
retreated
across
the
hall
except
the
officer
in
charge
who
refused
to
move
seaton
the
personification
of
offended
dignity
first
stared
at
the
offender
who
returned
the
stare
and
stepped
up
to
him
insolently
then
pushed
him
back
roughly
forgetting
that
his
strength
great
upon
earth
would
be
gigantic
upon
this
smaller
world
the
officer
spun
across
the
corridor
knocking
down
three
of
his
men
in
his
flight
picking
himself
up
he
drew
his
sword
and
rushed
while
his
men
fled
in
panic
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
corridor
seaton
did
not
wait
for
him
but
in
one
bound
leaped
across
the
intervening
space
to
meet
him
with
the
vastly
superior
agility
of
his
earthly
muscles
he
dodged
the
falling
broadsword
and
drove
his
left
fist
full
against
the
chin
with
all
the
force
of
his
mighty
arm
and
all
the
momentum
of
his
rapidly
moving
body
behind
the
blow
the
crack
of
breaking
bones
was
distinctly
audible
as
the
officer
head
snapped
back
the
force
of
the
blow
lifted
him
high
into
the
air
and
after
turning
a
complete
somersault
he
brought
up
with
a
crash
against
the
opposite
wall
dropping
to
the
floor
stone
dead
as
several
of
his
men
braver
than
the
others
lifted
their
peculiar
rifles
seaton
drew
and
fired
in
one
incredibly
swift
motion
the
bullet
obliterating
the
entire
group
of
men
and
demolishing
that
end
of
the
palace
in
the
meantime
the
slave
had
taken
several
pieces
of
apparatus
from
a
cabinet
in
the
room
and
had
placed
them
in
his
belt
stopping
only
to
observe
for
a
few
moments
a
small
instrument
which
he
clamped
upon
the
head
of
the
dead
man
he
rapidly
led
the
way
back
to
the
room
they
had
left
and
set
to
work
upon
the
instrument
he
had
constructed
while
the
others
had
been
asleep
he
connected
it
in
an
intricate
system
of
wiring
with
the
pieces
of
apparatus
he
had
just
recovered
that
a
complex
job
of
wiring
said
duquesne
admiringly
i
seen
several
intricate
pieces
of
apparatus
myself
but
he
has
so
many
circuits
there
that
i
lost
it
would
take
an
hour
to
figure
out
the
lines
and
connections
alone
straightening
abruptly
the
slave
clamped
several
electrodes
upon
his
temples
and
motioned
to
seaton
and
the
others
speaking
to
dorothy
as
he
did
so
he
wants
us
to
let
him
put
those
things
on
our
heads
she
translated
shall
we
let
him
dick
yes
he
replied
without
hesitation
i
got
a
real
hunch
that
our
friend
and
i
not
sure
of
nalboon
he
does
act
right
i
think
so
too
agreed
the
girl
and
crane
added
i
ca
say
that
i
relish
the
idea
but
since
i
know
that
you
are
a
good
poker
player
dick
i
am
willing
to
follow
your
hunch
how
about
you
duquesne
not
i
declared
that
worthy
emphatically
nobody
wires
me
up
to
anything
i
ca
understand
and
that
machine
is
too
deep
for
me
margaret
elected
to
follow
crane
example
and
impressed
by
the
need
for
haste
evident
in
the
slave
bearing
the
four
walked
up
to
the
machine
without
further
talk
the
electrodes
were
clamped
into
place
quickly
and
the
slave
pressed
a
lever
instantly
the
four
visitors
felt
that
they
had
a
complete
understanding
of
the
languages
and
customs
of
both
mardonale
the
nation
in
which
they
now
were
and
of
kondal
to
which
nation
the
slaves
belonged
the
only
two
civilized
nations
upon
osnome
while
the
look
of
amazement
at
this
method
of
receiving
instruction
was
still
upon
their
faces
the
slave
or
rather
as
they
now
knew
him
dunark
the
kofedix
or
crown
prince
of
the
great
nation
of
kondal
began
to
disconnect
the
wires
he
cut
out
the
wires
leading
to
the
two
girls
and
to
crane
and
was
reaching
for
seaton
when
there
was
a
blinding
flash
a
crackling
sound
the
heavy
smoke
of
burning
metal
and
insulation
and
both
dunark
and
seaton
fell
to
the
floor
before
crane
could
reach
them
however
they
were
upon
their
feet
and
the
stranger
said
in
his
own
tongue
now
understood
by
every
one
but
duquesne
this
machine
is
a
mechanical
educator
a
thing
entirely
new
in
our
world
at
least
although
i
have
been
working
on
it
for
a
long
time
it
is
still
in
a
very
crude
form
i
did
not
like
to
use
it
in
its
present
state
of
development
but
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
warn
you
of
what
nalboon
is
going
to
do
to
you
and
to
convince
you
that
the
best
way
of
saving
your
lives
would
save
our
lives
as
well
the
machine
worked
perfectly
until
something
i
do
know
what
went
wrong
instead
of
stopping
as
it
should
have
done
at
teaching
your
party
to
speak
our
languages
it
us
two
completely
so
that
every
convolution
in
each
of
our
brains
has
been
imprinted
upon
the
brain
of
the
other
it
was
the
sudden
formation
of
all
the
new
convolutions
that
rendered
us
unconscious
i
can
only
apologize
for
the
and
assure
you
that
my
intentions
were
of
the
best
you
need
apologize
returned
seaton
that
was
a
wonderful
performance
and
we
both
gainers
anyway
are
we
it
has
taken
us
all
our
lives
to
learn
what
little
we
know
and
now
we
each
have
the
benefit
of
two
lifetimes
spent
upon
different
worlds
i
must
admit
though
that
i
have
a
whole
lot
of
knowledge
that
i
do
know
how
to
use
i
am
glad
you
take
it
that
way
returned
the
other
warmly
for
i
am
infinitely
the
better
off
for
the
exchange
the
knowledge
i
imparted
was
nothing
compared
to
that
which
i
received
but
time
presses
i
must
tell
you
our
situation
i
am
as
you
now
know
the
kofedix
of
kondal
the
other
thirteen
are
fedo
and
fediro
or
as
you
would
say
princes
and
princesses
of
the
same
nation
we
were
captured
by
one
of
raiding
parties
while
upon
a
hunting
trip
being
overcome
by
some
new
stupefying
gas
so
that
we
could
not
kill
ourselves
as
you
know
kondal
and
mardonale
have
been
at
war
for
over
ten
thousand
karkamo
something
more
than
six
thousand
years
of
your
time
the
war
between
us
is
one
of
utter
extermination
captives
are
never
exchanged
and
only
once
during
an
ordinary
lifetime
does
one
ever
escape
our
attendants
were
killed
immediately
we
were
being
taken
to
furnish
sport
for
nalboon
party
by
being
fed
to
one
of
his
captive
kolono
animals
something
like
your
earthly
devilfish
when
the
escort
of
battleships
was
overcome
by
those
four
karlono
the
animals
you
saw
and
one
of
them
seized
plane
in
which
we
were
prisoners
you
killed
the
karlon
saving
our
lives
as
well
as
those
of
nalboon
and
his
party
having
saved
his
life
you
and
your
party
should
be
honored
guests
of
the
most
honored
kind
and
i
venture
to
say
that
you
would
be
so
regarded
in
any
other
nation
of
the
universe
but
nalboon
the
domak
a
title
equivalent
to
your
word
and
our
word
of
mardonale
is
utterly
without
either
honor
or
conscience
as
are
all
mardonalians
at
first
he
was
afraid
of
you
as
were
we
all
we
thought
you
visitors
from
a
planet
of
our
fifteenth
sun
which
is
now
at
its
nearest
possible
approach
to
us
after
your
display
of
superhuman
power
and
ability
we
expected
instant
annihilation
however
after
seeing
the
skylark
as
a
machine
discovering
that
you
are
short
of
power
and
finding
that
you
are
gentle
instead
of
bloodthirsty
by
nature
nalboon
lost
his
fear
of
you
and
resolved
to
rob
you
of
your
vessel
with
its
wonderful
secrets
of
power
though
we
are
so
ignorant
of
chemistry
that
i
can
not
understand
the
thousandth
part
of
what
i
just
learned
from
you
we
are
a
race
of
mechanics
and
have
developed
machines
of
many
kinds
to
a
high
state
of
efficiency
including
electrical
machines
of
all
kinds
in
fact
electricity
generated
by
our
great
waterfalls
is
our
only
power
no
scientist
upon
osnome
has
ever
had
an
inkling
that
energy
exists
nalboon
can
not
understand
the
power
but
he
solved
the
means
of
liberating
it
at
a
glance
and
that
glance
sealed
your
with
the
skylark
he
could
conquer
kondal
and
to
assure
the
downfall
of
my
nation
he
would
do
anything
also
he
or
any
other
osnomian
scientist
would
go
to
any
lengths
whatever
would
challenge
the
great
first
cause
itself
to
secure
even
one
of
those
little
bottles
of
the
chemical
you
call
it
is
far
and
away
the
scarcest
and
most
precious
substance
in
the
world
it
is
so
rare
that
those
bottles
you
produced
at
the
table
held
more
than
the
total
amount
previously
known
to
exist
upon
osnome
we
have
great
abundance
of
all
the
heavy
metals
but
the
lighter
metals
are
rare
sodium
and
chlorin
are
the
rarest
of
all
known
elements
its
immense
value
is
due
not
to
its
rarity
but
to
the
fact
that
it
is
an
indispensable
component
of
the
controlling
instruments
of
our
wireless
power
stations
and
that
it
is
used
as
a
catalyst
in
the
manufacture
of
our
hardest
metals
for
these
reasons
you
understand
why
nalboon
does
not
intend
to
let
you
escape
and
why
he
intends
that
this
kokam
our
equivalent
of
a
day
shall
be
your
last
about
the
second
or
third
kam
hour
of
the
sleeping
period
he
intends
to
break
into
the
skylark
learn
its
control
and
secure
the
salt
you
undoubtedly
have
in
the
vessel
then
my
party
and
myself
will
be
thrown
to
the
kolon
you
and
your
party
will
be
killed
and
your
bodies
smelted
to
recover
the
salt
that
is
in
them
this
is
the
warning
i
had
to
give
you
its
urgency
explains
the
use
of
my
untried
mechanical
educator
the
hope
that
my
party
could
escape
with
yours
in
your
vessel
explains
why
you
saw
me
the
kofedix
of
kondal
prostrate
myself
before
that
nalboon
how
do
you
a
captive
prince
of
another
nation
know
these
things
asked
crane
doubtfully
i
read
nalboon
ideas
from
the
brain
of
that
officer
whom
the
karfedix
seaton
killed
he
was
a
ladex
of
the
guards
an
officer
of
about
the
same
rank
as
one
of
your
colonels
he
was
high
in
nalboon
favor
and
he
was
to
have
been
in
charge
of
the
work
of
breaking
into
the
skylark
and
killing
us
all
let
me
caution
you
now
do
not
let
any
mardonalian
touch
our
hands
with
a
wire
for
if
you
do
your
thoughts
will
be
recorded
and
the
secrets
of
the
skylark
and
your
many
other
mysterious
things
such
as
smoking
matches
and
magic
feats
will
be
secrets
no
longer
thanks
for
the
information
responded
seaton
but
i
want
to
correct
your
title
for
me
i
no
karfedix
merely
a
plain
citizen
in
one
way
i
see
that
that
is
true
replied
the
kofedix
with
a
puzzled
look
i
can
not
understand
your
government
at
all
but
the
inventor
of
the
skylark
must
certainly
rank
as
a
karfedix
as
he
spoke
a
smile
of
understanding
passed
over
his
face
and
he
continued
i
see
your
title
is
doctor
of
philosophy
which
must
mean
that
you
are
the
karfedix
of
knowledge
of
the
earth
no
no
you
way
off
i
certainly
seaton
is
the
karfedix
of
knowledge
broke
in
duquesne
let
it
go
at
that
anyway
whatever
it
means
the
thing
to
do
now
is
to
figure
a
way
out
of
this
you
chirped
it
then
blackie
dunark
you
know
this
country
better
than
we
do
what
do
you
suggest
i
suggest
that
you
take
my
party
into
the
skylark
and
escape
from
mardonale
as
soon
as
possible
i
can
pilot
you
to
kondalek
the
capital
city
of
our
nation
there
i
can
assure
you
you
will
be
welcomed
as
you
deserve
my
father
the
karfedix
will
treat
you
as
a
karfedix
should
be
treated
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
nothing
i
can
ever
do
will
lighten
the
burden
of
my
indebtedness
to
you
but
i
promise
you
all
the
copper
you
want
and
anything
else
you
may
desire
that
is
within
the
power
of
man
to
give
you
seaton
thought
deeply
a
moment
then
shook
dunark
hand
vigorously
that
suits
me
kofedix
he
said
warmly
i
thought
from
the
first
that
you
were
our
friend
shall
we
make
for
the
skylark
right
now
or
wait
a
while
we
had
better
wait
until
after
the
second
meal
the
prince
replied
we
have
no
armor
and
no
way
of
making
any
we
would
be
helpless
against
the
bullets
of
any
except
a
group
small
enough
so
that
you
could
kill
them
all
before
they
could
fire
the
kam
after
the
second
meal
is
devoted
to
strolling
about
the
grounds
so
that
our
visiting
the
skylark
would
look
perfectly
natural
as
the
guard
is
very
lax
at
that
time
it
is
the
best
time
for
the
attempt
but
how
about
my
killing
his
company
of
guards
and
blowing
up
one
wing
of
his
palace
wo
he
have
something
to
say
about
that
i
do
know
replied
the
kofedix
doubtfully
it
depends
upon
whether
his
fear
of
you
or
his
anger
is
the
greater
he
should
pay
his
call
of
state
here
in
your
apartment
in
a
short
time
as
it
is
the
inviolable
rule
of
osnome
that
any
visitor
shall
receive
a
call
of
state
from
one
of
his
own
rank
before
leaving
his
apartment
for
the
first
time
his
actions
may
give
you
some
idea
as
to
his
feelings
though
he
is
an
accomplished
diplomat
and
may
conceal
his
real
feelings
entirely
but
let
me
caution
you
not
to
be
modest
or
he
will
mistake
softness
for
fear
all
right
grinned
seaton
in
that
case
i
wo
wait
to
try
to
find
out
what
he
thinks
if
he
shows
any
signs
of
hostility
at
all
i
open
up
on
him
well
remarked
crane
calmly
if
we
have
some
time
to
spare
we
may
as
well
wait
comfortably
instead
of
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
for
one
have
a
lot
of
questions
to
ask
about
this
new
world
acting
upon
this
suggestion
the
party
seated
themselves
upon
comfortable
divans
and
dunark
rapidly
dismantled
the
machine
he
had
constructed
the
captives
remained
standing
always
behind
the
visitors
until
seaton
remonstrated
please
sit
down
everybody
there
no
need
of
keeping
up
this
farce
of
your
being
slaves
as
long
as
we
alone
is
there
dunark
no
but
at
the
first
sound
of
the
gong
announcing
a
visitor
we
must
be
in
our
places
now
that
we
are
all
comfortable
and
waiting
i
will
introduce
my
party
to
yours
fellow
kondalians
greet
the
karfedo
seaton
and
crane
he
began
his
tongue
fumbling
over
the
strange
names
of
a
distant
world
the
earth
and
the
two
noble
ladies
miss
vaneman
and
miss
spencer
soon
to
be
their
karfediro
guests
from
earth
allow
me
to
present
to
you
the
kofedir
sitar
the
only
one
of
my
wives
who
accompanied
me
upon
our
hunting
expedition
then
still
ignoring
duquesne
as
a
captive
he
introduced
the
other
kondolians
in
turn
as
his
brothers
sisters
cousins
nieces
and
nephews
all
members
of
the
great
ruling
house
of
kondal
now
he
concluded
after
i
have
a
word
with
you
in
private
doctor
seaton
i
will
be
glad
to
give
the
others
all
the
information
in
my
power
he
led
seaton
out
of
earshot
of
the
others
and
said
in
a
low
voice
it
is
no
part
of
nalboon
plan
to
kill
the
two
women
they
are
so
beautiful
so
different
from
our
osnomian
women
that
he
intends
to
keep
them
alive
understand
yes
returned
seaton
grimly
his
eyes
turning
hard
i
get
you
all
right
but
what
he
do
and
what
he
thinks
he
do
are
two
entirely
different
breeds
of
cats
returning
to
the
others
they
found
dorothy
and
sitar
deep
in
conversation
so
a
man
has
half
a
dozen
or
so
wives
dorothy
was
asking
in
surprise
how
do
you
get
along
together
i
fight
like
a
wildcat
if
my
husband
tried
to
have
other
wives
we
get
along
splendidly
of
course
returned
the
osnomian
princess
in
equal
surprise
i
would
not
think
of
being
a
man
only
wife
i
would
consider
marrying
a
man
who
could
win
only
one
wife
think
what
a
disgrace
it
would
be
and
think
how
lonely
one
would
be
while
her
husband
is
away
at
war
we
would
go
insane
if
we
did
not
have
the
company
of
the
other
wives
there
are
six
of
us
and
we
could
not
get
along
at
all
without
each
other
i
got
a
compliment
for
you
and
peggy
dottie
said
seaton
dunark
here
thinks
that
you
two
girls
look
good
enough
to
eat
or
words
to
that
effect
both
girls
flushed
slightly
the
color
suffusing
their
faces
they
glanced
at
each
other
and
dorothy
voiced
the
thought
of
both
as
she
said
how
can
you
kofedix
dunark
in
this
horrible
light
we
both
look
perfectly
dreadful
these
other
girls
would
be
beautiful
if
we
were
used
to
the
colors
but
we
two
look
simply
hideous
oh
no
interrupted
sitar
you
have
a
wonderfully
rich
coloring
it
is
a
shame
to
hide
so
much
of
yourselves
with
robes
their
eyes
interpret
colors
differently
than
ours
do
explained
seaton
what
to
us
are
harsh
and
discordant
colors
are
light
and
pleasing
to
their
eyes
what
looks
like
a
kind
of
sloppy
greenish
black
to
us
may
in
fact
does
look
a
pale
pink
to
them
are
kondal
and
mardonale
the
only
two
nations
upon
osnome
asked
crane
the
only
civilized
nations
yes
osnome
is
divided
into
two
great
and
almost
equal
continents
separated
by
a
wide
ocean
which
encircles
the
globe
one
is
kondal
the
other
mardonale
each
nation
has
several
nations
or
tribes
of
savages
which
inhabit
various
waste
places
you
are
the
light
race
mardonale
the
dark
continued
crane
what
are
the
servants
who
seem
between
they
are
slaves
captured
savages
interrupted
dorothy
no
they
are
a
separate
race
they
are
a
race
so
low
in
intelligence
that
they
can
not
exist
except
as
slaves
but
they
can
be
trained
to
understand
language
and
to
do
certain
kinds
of
work
they
are
harmless
and
mild
making
excellent
servants
otherwise
they
would
have
perished
ages
ago
all
menial
work
and
most
of
the
manual
labor
is
done
by
the
slave
race
formerly
criminals
were
sterilized
and
reduced
to
unwilling
slavery
but
there
have
been
no
unwilling
slaves
in
kondal
for
hundreds
of
karkamo
why
are
there
no
criminals
any
more
no
with
the
invention
of
the
thought
recorder
an
absolutely
fair
trial
was
assured
and
the
guilty
were
all
convicted
they
could
not
reproduce
themselves
and
as
a
natural
result
crime
died
out
that
is
he
added
hastily
what
we
regard
as
crime
duelling
for
instance
is
a
crime
upon
earth
here
it
is
a
regular
custom
in
kondal
duels
are
rather
rare
and
are
held
only
when
honor
is
involved
but
here
in
mardonale
they
are
an
affair
as
you
saw
when
you
landed
what
makes
the
difference
asked
dorothy
curiously
as
you
know
with
us
every
man
is
a
soldier
in
kondal
we
train
our
youth
in
courage
valor
and
high
honor
in
mardonale
they
train
them
in
savage
alone
each
nation
fixed
its
policy
in
bygone
ages
to
produce
the
type
of
soldier
it
thought
most
efficient
i
notice
that
everyone
here
wears
those
heavy
collars
said
margaret
what
are
they
for
they
are
identification
marks
when
a
child
is
nearly
grown
a
collar
bearing
his
name
and
the
device
of
his
house
is
cast
about
his
neck
this
collar
is
made
of
a
synthetic
metal
which
once
formed
can
not
be
altered
by
any
usual
means
it
can
not
be
scratched
cut
bent
broken
or
worked
in
any
way
except
at
such
a
high
temperature
that
death
would
result
if
such
heat
were
applied
to
the
collar
once
the
arenak
collar
is
cast
about
a
person
neck
he
is
identified
for
life
and
any
adult
osnomian
not
wearing
a
collar
is
put
to
death
that
must
be
an
interesting
metal
remarked
crane
is
your
belt
a
similar
mark
this
belt
is
an
idea
of
my
own
and
dunark
smiled
broadly
it
looks
like
opaque
arenak
but
is
it
is
merely
a
pouch
in
which
i
carry
anything
i
am
particularly
interested
in
even
nalboon
thought
it
was
arenak
so
he
did
trouble
to
try
to
open
it
if
he
had
opened
it
and
taken
my
tools
and
instruments
i
could
have
built
the
educator
is
that
transparent
armor
arenak
yes
the
only
difference
being
that
nothing
is
added
to
the
matrix
to
color
or
make
opaque
the
finished
metal
it
is
in
the
preparation
of
this
metal
that
salt
is
indispensable
it
acts
only
as
a
catalyst
being
recovered
afterward
but
neither
nation
has
ever
had
enough
salt
to
make
all
the
armor
they
want
are
those
monsters
karlono
i
think
you
called
them
covered
by
the
same
thing
and
what
are
those
animals
anyway
dorothy
asked
yes
they
are
armored
with
arenak
and
it
is
thought
that
the
beasts
grow
it
the
same
as
fishes
grow
scales
the
karlono
are
the
most
frightful
scourge
of
osnome
very
little
is
known
of
them
though
every
scientist
has
theorized
upon
them
since
time
immemorial
it
is
very
seldom
that
one
is
ever
killed
as
they
easily
outfly
our
swiftest
battleships
and
only
fight
when
they
can
be
victorious
to
kill
one
requires
a
succession
of
the
heaviest
shells
in
the
same
spot
a
joint
in
the
armor
and
after
the
armor
is
once
penetrated
the
animal
is
blown
into
such
small
fragments
that
reconstruction
is
impossible
from
such
remains
it
has
been
variously
described
as
a
bird
a
beast
a
fish
and
a
vegetable
sexual
asexual
and
hermaphroditic
its
habitat
is
unknown
it
being
variously
supposed
to
live
high
in
the
air
deep
in
the
ocean
and
buried
in
the
swamps
another
theory
is
that
they
live
upon
one
of
our
satellites
which
encounters
our
belt
of
atmosphere
every
karkam
nothing
is
certainly
known
about
the
monsters
except
their
terrible
destructiveness
and
their
insatiable
appetites
one
of
them
will
devour
five
or
six
airships
at
one
time
absorbing
the
crews
and
devouring
the
cargo
and
all
of
the
vessels
except
the
very
hardest
of
the
metal
parts
do
they
usually
go
in
groups
asked
crane
if
they
do
i
should
think
that
a
fleet
of
warships
would
be
necessary
for
every
party
no
they
are
almost
always
found
alone
only
very
rarely
are
two
found
together
this
is
the
first
time
in
history
that
more
than
two
have
ever
been
seen
together
two
battleships
can
always
defeat
one
karlon
so
they
are
never
attacked
with
four
battleships
nalboon
considered
his
expedition
perfectly
safe
especially
as
they
are
now
rare
the
navies
hunted
down
and
killed
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
last
one
upon
osnome
more
than
a
karkam
ago
and
none
have
been
seen
since
until
we
were
attacked
the
gong
over
the
door
sounded
and
the
kondalians
leaped
to
their
positions
back
of
the
earthly
visitors
the
kofedix
went
to
the
door
nalboon
brushed
him
aside
and
entered
escorted
by
a
full
company
of
soldiery
a
scowl
of
anger
was
upon
his
face
and
he
was
plainly
in
an
ugly
mood
stop
nalboon
of
mardonale
thundered
seaton
in
the
mardonalian
tongue
and
with
the
full
power
of
his
mighty
voice
dare
you
invade
my
privacy
unannounced
and
without
invitation
the
escort
shrank
back
but
the
domak
stood
his
ground
although
he
was
plainly
taken
aback
with
an
apparent
effort
he
smoothed
his
face
into
lines
of
cordiality
i
merely
came
to
inquire
why
my
guards
are
slain
and
my
palace
destroyed
by
my
honored
guest
as
for
slaying
your
guards
they
sought
to
invade
my
privacy
i
warned
them
away
but
one
of
them
was
foolish
enough
to
try
to
kill
me
then
the
others
attempted
to
raise
their
childish
rifles
against
me
and
i
was
obliged
to
destroy
them
as
for
the
wall
it
happened
to
be
in
the
way
of
the
i
hurled
against
your
guards
consequently
it
was
demolished
an
honored
guest
bah
are
honored
guests
put
to
the
indignity
of
being
touched
by
the
filthy
hands
of
a
mere
ladex
you
do
not
object
to
the
touch
of
slaves
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
kondalians
that
is
what
slaves
are
for
coldly
is
a
domak
to
wait
upon
himself
in
the
court
of
mardonale
but
to
return
to
the
issue
were
i
an
honored
guest
this
would
never
have
happened
know
nalboon
that
when
you
attempt
to
treat
a
visiting
domak
of
my
race
as
a
captive
you
must
be
prepared
to
suffer
the
consequences
of
your
rashness
may
i
ask
how
you
so
recently
ignorant
know
our
language
you
question
me
that
is
bold
know
that
i
the
boss
of
the
road
show
ignorance

knowledge
when
and
where

please
you
may
go
chapter
xv
the
escape
from
mardonale
that
was
a
wonderful
bluff
dick
exclaimed
the
kofedix
in
english
as
soon
as
nalboon
and
his
guards
had
disappeared
that
was
exactly
the
tone
to
take
with
him
too
you
sure
got
him
guessing
it
seemed
to
get
him
all
right
but
i
wondering
how
long
it
hold
him
i
think
we
better
make
a
dash
for
the
skylark
right
now
before
he
has
time
to
think
it
over
do
you
that
is
undoubtedly
the
best
way
dunark
replied
lapsing
into
his
own
tongue
nalboon
is
plainly
in
awe
of
you
now
but
if
i
understand
him
at
all
he
is
more
than
ever
determined
to
seize
your
vessel
and
every
darkam
delay
is
dangerous
the
quickly
secured
the
few
personal
belongings
they
had
brought
with
them
stepping
out
into
the
hall
and
waving
away
the
guards
seaton
motioned
dunark
to
lead
the
way
the
other
captives
fell
in
behind
as
they
had
done
before
and
the
party
walked
boldly
toward
the
door
of
the
palace
the
guards
offered
no
opposition
but
stood
at
attention
and
saluted
as
they
passed
as
they
approached
the
entrance
however
seaton
saw
the
hurrying
away
and
surmised
that
he
was
carrying
the
news
to
nalboon
outside
the
door
walking
directly
toward
the
landing
dock
dunark
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
seaton
without
turning
nalboon
knows
by
this
time
that
we
are
making
our
escape
and
it
will
be
war
to
the
death
from
here
to
the
skylark
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
any
pursuit
from
the
palace
but
he
has
warned
the
officers
in
charge
of
the
dock
and
they
will
try
to
kill
us
as
soon
as
we
step
out
of
the
elevator
perhaps
sooner
nalboon
intended
to
wait
but
we
have
forced
his
hand
and
the
dock
is
undoubtedly
swarming
with
soldiers
now
shoot
first
and
oftenest
shoot
first
and
think
afterward
show
no
mercy
as
you
will
receive
none
remember
that
the
quality
you
call
does
not
exist
upon
osnome
rounding
a
great
metal
statue
about
fifty
feet
from
the
base
of
the
towering
dock
they
saw
that
the
door
leading
into
one
of
the
elevators
was
wide
open
and
that
two
guards
stood
just
inside
it
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
approaching
party
the
guards
raised
their
rifles
but
quick
as
they
were
seaton
was
quicker
at
the
first
sight
of
the
open
door
he
had
made
two
quick
steps
and
had
hurled
himself
across
the
intervening
forty
feet
in
a
long
football
plunge
before
the
two
guards
could
straighten
he
crashed
into
them
his
great
momentum
hurling
them
across
the
elevator
cage
and
crushing
them
into
unconsciousness
against
its
metal
wall
good
work
said
dunark
as
he
preceded
the
others
into
the
elevator
and
after
receiving
seaton
permission
distributed
the
weapons
of
the
two
guards
among
the
men
of
his
party
now
we
can
surprise
those
upon
the
roof
that
was
why
you
did
shoot
yes
i
was
afraid
to
risk
a
shot
it
would
give
the
whole
thing
away
seaton
replied
as
he
threw
the
unconscious
guards
out
into
the
grounds
and
closed
the
massive
door
are
you
going
to
kill
them
asked
sitar
amazement
in
every
feature
and
a
puzzled
expression
in
her
splendid
eyes
a
murmur
arose
from
the
other
kondalians
which
was
quickly
silenced
by
the
kofedix
it
is
dishonorable
for
a
soldier
of
earth
to
kill
a
helpless
prisoner
he
said
briefly
we
can
not
understand
it
but
we
must
not
attempt
to
sway
him
in
any
point
of
honor
dunark
stepped
to
the
controls
and
the
elevator
shot
upward
stopping
at
a
landing
several
stories
below
the
top
of
the
dock
he
took
a
peculiar
device
from
his
belt
and
fitted
it
over
the
muzzle
of
his
strange
pistol
we
will
get
out
here
he
instructed
the
others
and
go
up
the
rest
of
the
way
by
a
flight
of
stairs
we
will
probably
encounter
some
few
guards
but
i
can
dispose
of
them
without
raising
an
alarm
you
will
all
stay
behind
me
please
seaton
remonstrated
and
dunark
went
on
no
seaton
you
have
done
your
share
and
more
i
am
upon
familiar
ground
now
and
can
do
the
work
alone
better
than
if
you
were
to
help
me
i
will
call
upon
you
however
before
we
reach
the
dock
the
kofedix
led
the
way
his
pistol
resting
lightly
against
his
hip
and
at
the
first
turn
of
the
corridor
they
came
full
upon
four
guards
the
pistol
did
not
move
from
its
place
at
the
side
of
the
leader
but
there
were
four
subdued
clicks
and
the
four
guards
dropped
dead
with
bullets
through
their
brains
seaton
that
is
silencer
whispered
duquesne
i
did
suppose
a
silencer
could
work
that
fast
they
do
use
powder
seaton
replied
absently
all
his
faculties
directed
toward
the
next
corner
the
bullets
are
propelled
by
an
electrical
charge
in
the
same
manner
dunark
disposed
of
several
more
guards
before
the
last
stairway
was
reached
seaton
he
whispered
in
english
now
is
the
time
we
need
your
rapid
and
your
shells
there
must
be
hundreds
of
soldiers
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
armed
with
shooting
shells
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
per
minute
our
chance
is
this
their
guns
are
probably
trained
upon
the
elevators
and
main
stairways
since
this
passage
is
unused
and
none
of
us
would
be
expected
to
know
of
it
most
of
them
do
know
of
it
themselves
it
will
take
them
a
second
or
two
to
bring
their
guns
to
bear
upon
us
we
must
do
all
the
damage
we
can
kill
them
all
if
possible
in
that
second
or
two
if
crane
will
lend
me
a
pistol
we
make
the
rush
together
i
a
better
scheme
than
that
interrupted
duquesne
next
to
you
seaton
i
the
fastest
man
with
a
gun
here
also
like
you
i
can
use
both
hands
at
once
give
me
a
couple
of
clips
of
those
special
cartridges
and
you
and
i
will
blow
that
bunch
into
the
air
before
they
know
we
here
it
was
decided
that
the
two
pistol
experts
should
take
the
lead
closely
followed
by
crane
and
dunark
the
weapons
were
loaded
to
capacity
and
put
in
readiness
for
instant
use
let
go
bunch
said
seaton
the
quicker
we
start
the
quicker
get
back
get
ready
to
run
out
there
all
the
rest
of
you
as
soon
as
the
battle
over
ready
on
your
marks
get
set
go
he
kicked
the
door
open
and
there
was
a
stuttering
crash
as
the
four
automatic
pistols
simultaneously
burst
into
practically
continuous
flame
a
crash
obliterated
by
an
overwhelming
concussion
of
sound
as
the
shells
sweeping
the
entire
roof
with
a
fan
of
death
struck
their
marks
and
exploded
well
it
was
for
the
little
group
of
wanderers
that
the
two
men
in
the
door
were
past
masters
in
the
art
of
handling
their
weapons
well
it
was
that
they
had
in
their
tiny
the
explosive
force
of
hundreds
of
giant
shells
for
rank
upon
rank
of
soldiery
were
massed
upon
the
roof
cannon
terrible
engines
of
destruction
were
pointing
toward
the
elevators
and
toward
the
main
stairways
and
approaches
but
so
rapid
and
fierce
was
the
attack
that
even
those
trained
gunners
had
no
time
to
point
their
guns
the
battle
lasted
little
more
than
a
second
being
over
before
either
crane
or
dunark
could
fire
a
shot
and
silence
again
reigned
even
while
broken
and
shattered
remnants
of
the
guns
and
fragments
of
the
metal
and
stone
of
the
dock
were
still
falling
to
the
ground
through
a
fine
mist
of
what
had
once
been
men
assured
by
a
rapid
glance
that
not
a
single
mardonalian
remained
upon
the
dock
seaton
turned
back
to
the
others
make
it
snappy
bunch
this
is
going
to
be
a
mighty
unhealthy
spot
for
us
in
a
few
minutes
dorothy
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
in
relief
with
one
arm
about
her
he
hastily
led
the
way
across
the
dock
toward
the
skylark
choosing
the
path
with
care
because
of
the
yawning
holes
blown
into
the
structure
by
the
terrific
force
of
the
explosions
the
skylark
was
still
in
place
held
immovable
by
the
attractor
but
what
a
sight
she
was
her
crystal
windows
were
shattered
her
mighty
plates
of
norwegian
armor
were
bent
and
cracked
and
twisted
two
of
her
doors
warped
and
battered
hung
awry
from
their
broken
hinges
not
a
shell
had
struck
her
all
this
damage
had
been
done
by
flying
fragments
of
the
guns
and
of
the
dock
itself
and
seaton
and
crane
who
had
developed
the
new
explosive
stood
aghast
at
its
awful
power
they
hastily
climbed
into
the
vessel
and
seaton
assured
himself
that
the
controls
were
uninjured
i
hear
battleships
dunark
said
is
it
permitted
that
i
operate
one
of
your
machine
guns
go
as
far
as
you
like
responded
seaton
as
he
placed
the
women
beneath
the
copper
bar
the
safest
place
in
the
vessel
and
leaped
to
the
instrument
board
before
he
reached
it
and
while
duquesne
crane
and
dunark
were
hastening
to
the
guns
the
whine
of
giant
was
plainly
heard
a
ranging
shell
from
the
first
warship
sighted
a
little
low
exploded
against
the
side
of
the
dock
beneath
them
he
reached
the
levers
just
as
the
second
shell
screamed
through
the
air
a
bare
four
feet
above
them
as
he
shot
the
skylark
into
the
air
under
five
notches
of
power
a
steady
stream
of
the
huge
bombs
poured
through
the
spot
where
an
instant
before
the
vessel
had
been
crane
and
duquesne
aimed
several
shots
at
the
battleships
which
were
approaching
from
all
sides
but
the
range
was
so
extreme
that
no
damage
was
done
they
heard
the
continuous
chattering
of
the
machine
gun
operated
by
the
kofedix
however
and
turned
toward
him
he
was
shooting
not
at
the
warships
but
at
the
city
rapidly
growing
smaller
beneath
them
moving
the
barrel
of
the
rifle
in
a
tiny
spiral
spraying
the
entire
city
with
death
and
destruction
as
they
looked
the
first
of
the
shells
reached
the
ground
just
as
dunark
ceased
firing
for
lack
of
ammunition
they
saw
the
palace
disappear
as
if
by
magic
being
instantly
blotted
out
in
a
cloud
of
dust
a
cloud
which
with
a
spiral
motion
of
dizzying
rapidity
increased
in
size
until
it
obscured
the
entire
city
having
attained
sufficient
altitude
to
be
safe
from
any
possible
pursuit
and
out
of
range
of
even
the
heaviest
guns
seaton
stopped
the
vessel
and
went
out
into
the
main
compartment
to
consult
with
the
other
members
of
the
group
about
their
next
move
it
sure
does
feel
good
to
get
a
breath
of
cool
air
folks
he
said
as
he
drew
with
relief
a
deep
breath
of
the
air
which
at
that
great
elevation
was
of
an
icy
temperature
and
very
thin
he
glanced
at
the
little
group
of
kondalians
as
he
spoke
then
leaped
back
to
the
instrument
board
with
an
apology
on
his
lips
they
were
gasping
for
breath
and
shivering
with
the
cold
he
switched
on
the
heating
coils
and
dropped
the
skylark
rapidly
in
a
long
descent
toward
the
ocean
if
that
is
the
temperature
you
enjoy
i
understand
at
last
why
you
wear
clothes
said
the
kofedix
as
soon
as
he
could
talk
do
not
your
planes
fly
up
into
the
regions
of
low
temperature
asked
crane
only
occasionally
and
all
vessels
are
enclosed
and
heated
to
our
normal
temperature
we
have
heavy
wraps
but
we
dislike
to
wear
them
so
intensely
that
we
never
subject
ourselves
to
any
cold
well
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
returned
seaton
but
i
hand
your
climate
a
thing
it
hotter
even
than
washington
in
august
that
as
the
poet
feelingly
remarked
going
some
but
there
no
reason
for
sitting
here
in
the
dark
he
continued
as
he
switched
on
the
powerful
daylight
lamps
which
lighted
the
vessel
with
the
nearest
approach
to
sunlight
possible
to
produce
as
soon
as
the
lights
were
on
dorothy
looked
intently
at
the
strange
women
now
we
can
see
what
color
they
really
are
she
explained
to
her
lover
in
a
low
voice
why
they
are
so
very
different
from
what
they
were
before
except
that
the
colors
are
much
softer
and
more
pleasing
they
really
are
beautiful
in
spite
of
being
green
do
you
think
so
dick
they
a
handsome
bunch
all
right
he
agreed
and
they
were
their
skins
were
a
light
soft
green
tanned
to
an
olive
shade
by
their
many
fervent
suns
their
teeth
were
a
brilliant
and
shining
their
eyes
and
their
long
thick
hair
were
a
glossy
black
the
kondalians
looked
at
the
earthly
visitors
and
at
each
other
and
the
women
uttered
exclamations
of
horror
what
a
frightful
light
exclaimed
sitar
please
shut
it
off
i
would
rather
be
in
total
darkness
than
look
like
this
what
the
matter
sitar
asked
the
puzzled
dorothy
as
seaton
turned
off
the
lights
you
look
perfectly
stunning
in
this
light
they
see
things
differently
than
we
do
explained
seaton
their
optic
nerves
react
differently
than
ours
do
while
we
look
all
right
to
them
and
they
look
all
right
to
us
in
both
kinds
of
light
they
look
just
as
different
to
themselves
under
our
daylight
lamps
as
we
do
to
ourselves
in
their
green
light
is
that
explanation
clear
it
clear
enough
as
far
as
it
goes
but
what
do
they
look
like
to
themselves
that
too
deep
for
me
i
ca
explain
it
any
better
than
you
can
take
the
osnomian
color
for
instance
can
you
describe
it
it
a
kind
of
greenish
orange
but
it
seems
as
though
it
ought
not
to
look
like
that
color
either
that
it
exactly
from
the
knowledge
you
received
from
the
educator
it
should
be
a
brilliant
purple
that
is
due
to
the
difference
in
the
optic
nerves
which
explains
why
we
see
things
so
differently
from
the
way
the
osnomians
do
perhaps
they
can
describe
the
way
they
look
to
each
other
in
our
white
light
can
you
sitar
asked
dorothy
one
word
describes
it
replied
the
kondalian
princess
and
her
husband
added
the
colors
are
distorted
and
unrecognizable
just
as
your
colors
are
to
your
eyes
in
our
light
well
now
that
the
color
question
is
answered
let
get
going
i
pretty
nearly
asked
you
the
way
dunark
forgot
that
i
know
it
as
well
as
you
do
the
skylark
set
off
at
as
high
an
altitude
as
the
osnomians
could
stand
as
they
neared
the
ocean
several
great
mardonalian
battleships
warned
of
the
escape
sought
to
intercept
them
but
the
skylark
hopped
over
them
easily
out
of
range
of
their
heaviest
guns
and
flew
onward
at
such
speed
that
pursuit
was
not
even
attempted
the
ocean
was
quickly
crossed
soon
the
came
to
rest
over
a
great
city
and
seaton
pointed
out
the
palace
which
with
its
landing
dock
nearby
was
very
similar
to
that
of
nalboon
in
the
capital
city
of
mardonale
crane
drew
seaton
to
one
side
do
you
think
it
is
safe
to
trust
these
kondalians
any
more
than
it
was
the
others
how
would
it
be
to
stay
in
the
lark
instead
of
going
into
the
palace
yes
mart
this
bunch
can
be
trusted
dunark
has
a
lot
of
darn
queer
ideas
but
he
square
as
a
die
he
our
friend
and
will
get
us
the
copper
we
have
no
choice
now
anyway
look
at
the
bar
we
have
an
ounce
of
copper
left
we
down
to
the
plating
in
spots
besides
we
could
go
anywhere
if
we
had
a
ton
of
copper
because
the
old
bus
is
a
wreck
she
wo
hold
air
you
could
throw
a
cat
out
through
the
shell
in
any
direction
she
have
to
have
a
lot
of
work
done
on
her
before
we
can
think
of
leaving
as
to
staying
in
her
that
would
help
us
a
bit
steel
is
as
soft
as
wood
to
these
folks
their
shells
would
go
through
her
as
though
she
were
made
of
mush
they
are
made
of
metal
that
is
harder
than
diamond
and
tougher
than
rubber
and
when
they
strike
they
bore
in
like
if
they
are
out
to
get
us
they
do
it
anyway
whether
we
here
or
there
so
we
may
as
well
be
guests
but
there
no
danger
mart
you
know
i
swapped
brains
with
him
and
i
know
him
as
well
as
i
know
myself
he
a
good
square
man
one
of
our
kind
of
folks
convinced
crane
nodded
his
head
and
the
skylark
dropped
toward
the
dock
while
they
were
still
high
in
air
dunark
took
an
instrument
from
his
belt
and
rapidly
manipulated
a
small
lever
the
others
felt
the
air
vibrate
a
peculiar
pulsating
wave
which
to
the
surprise
of
the
earthly
visitors
they
could
read
without
difficulty
it
was
a
message
from
the
kofedix
to
the
entire
city
telling
of
the
escape
of
his
party
and
giving
the
news
that
he
was
accompanied
by
two
great
karfedo
from
another
world
then
the
pulsations
became
unintelligible
and
all
knew
that
he
had
tuned
his
instrument
away
from
the
general
key
into
the
individual
key
of
some
one
person
i
just
let
my
father
the
karfedix
know
that
we
are
coming
he
explained
as
the
vibrations
ceased
from
the
city
beneath
them
hundreds
of
great
guns
roared
forth
a
welcome
banners
and
streamers
hung
from
every
possible
point
and
the
air
became
tinted
and
perfumed
with
a
bewildering
variety
of
colors
and
scents
and
quivered
with
the
rush
of
messages
of
welcome
the
skylark
was
soon
surrounded
by
a
majestic
fleet
of
giant
warships
who
escorted
her
with
impressive
ceremony
to
the
landing
dock
while
around
them
flitted
great
numbers
of
other
aircraft
the
tiny
helicopters
darted
hither
and
thither
apparently
always
in
imminent
danger
of
colliding
with
some
of
their
larger
neighbors
but
always
escaping
as
though
by
a
miracle
beautiful
soared
and
dipped
and
wheeled
like
giant
gulls
and
cleaving
their
stately
way
through
the
numberless
lesser
craft
immense
multiplane
passenger
liners
partially
supported
by
helicopter
screws
turned
aside
from
their
scheduled
courses
to
pay
homage
to
the
kofedix
of
kondal
as
the
skylark
approached
the
top
of
the
dock
all
the
escorting
vessels
dropped
away
and
crane
saw
that
instead
of
the
brilliant
assemblage
he
had
expected
to
see
upon
the
there
was
only
a
small
group
of
persons
as
completely
unadorned
as
were
those
in
the
car
in
answer
to
his
look
of
surprise
the
kofedix
said
with
deep
feeling
my
father
mother
and
the
rest
of
the
family
they
know
that
we
as
escaped
captives
would
be
without
harness
or
trappings
and
are
meeting
us
in
the
same
state
seaton
brought
the
vessel
to
the
dock
near
the
little
group
and
the
earthly
visitors
remained
inside
their
vessel
while
the
rulers
of
kondal
welcomed
the
sons
and
daughters
they
had
given
up
for
dead
after
the
affecting
reunion
which
was
very
similar
to
an
earthly
one
under
similar
circumstances
the
kofedix
led
his
father
up
to
the
skylark
and
his
guests
stepped
down
upon
the
dock
friends
dunark
began
i
have
told
you
of
my
father
roban
the
karfedix
of
kondal
father
it
is
a
great
honor
to
present
to
you
those
who
rescued
us
from
mardonale
seaton
karfedix
of
knowledge
crane
karfedix
of
wealth
miss
vaneman
and
miss
spencer
karfedix
duquesne
waving
his
hand
toward
him
is
a
lesser
karfedix
of
knowledge
captive
to
the
others
the
kofedix
dunark
exaggerates
our
services
deprecated
seaton
and
does
mention
the
fact
that
he
saved
all
our
lives
but
for
him
we
all
should
have
been
killed
the
karfedix
disregarding
seaton
remark
acknowledged
the
indebtedness
of
kondal
in
heartfelt
accents
before
he
led
them
back
to
the
other
party
and
made
the
introductions
as
all
walked
toward
the
elevators
the
emperor
turned
to
his
son
with
a
puzzled
expression
i
know
from
your
message
dunark
that
our
guests
are
from
a
distant
solar
system
and
i
can
understand
your
accident
with
the
educator
but
i
can
not
understand
the
titles
of
these
men
knowledge
and
wealth
are
not
ruled
over
are
you
sure
that
you
have
translated
their
titles
correctly
as
correctly
as
i
can
we
have
no
words
in
our
language
to
express
the
meaning
their
government
is
a
most
peculiar
one
the
rulers
all
being
chosen
by
the
people
of
the
whole
nation
extraordinary
interjected
the
older
man
how
then
can
anything
be
accomplished
i
do
not
understand
the
thing
myself
it
is
so
utterly
but
they
have
no
royalty
as
we
understand
the
term
in
america
their
country
every
man
is
equal
that
is
he
hastened
to
correct
himself
they
are
not
all
equal
either
as
they
have
two
classes
which
would
rank
with
royalty
those
who
have
attained
to
great
heights
of
knowledge
and
those
who
have
amassed
great
wealth
this
explanation
is
entirely
inadequate
and
does
not
give
the
right
idea
of
their
positions
but
it
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
to
the
truth
in
our
language
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
be
carrying
a
prisoner
with
you
karfedo
said
roban
addressing
seaton
and
crane
you
will
of
course
be
at
perfect
liberty
to
put
him
to
death
in
any
way
that
pleases
you
just
as
though
you
were
in
your
own
kingdoms
but
perchance
you
are
saving
him
so
that
his
death
will
crown
your
the
kofedix
spoke
in
answer
while
seaton
usually
so
quick
to
speak
was
groping
for
words
no
father
he
is
not
to
be
put
to
death
that
is
another
peculiar
custom
of
the
they
consider
it
dishonorable
to
harm
a
captive
or
even
an
unarmed
enemy
for
that
reason
we
must
treat
the
karfedix
duquesne
with
every
courtesy
due
his
rank
but
at
the
same
time
he
is
to
be
allowed
to
do
only
such
things
as
may
be
permitted
by
seaton
and
crane
yet
they
do
not
seem
to
be
a
weak
race
mused
the
older
man
they
are
a
mighty
race
far
advanced
in
evolution
replied
his
son
it
is
not
weakness
but
a
peculiar
moral
code
we
have
many
things
to
learn
from
them
and
but
few
to
give
them
in
return
their
visit
will
mean
much
to
kondal
during
this
conversation
they
had
descended
to
the
ground
and
had
reached
the
palace
after
traversing
grounds
even
more
sumptuous
and
splendid
than
those
surrounding
the
palace
of
nalboon
inside
the
palace
walls
the
kofedix
himself
led
the
guests
to
their
rooms
accompanied
by
the
and
an
escort
of
guards
he
explained
to
them
that
the
rooms
were
all
each
having
a
completely
equipped
bathroom
complete
except
for
cold
water
you
mean
said
seaton
with
a
smile
there
is
cold
water
rejoined
the
other
leading
him
into
the
bathroom
and
releasing
a
stream
of
lukewarm
water
into
the
small
swimming
pool
built
of
polished
metal
which
forms
part
of
every
kondalian
bathroom
but
i
am
forgetting
that
you
like
extreme
cold
we
will
install
refrigerating
machines
at
once
do
do
it
thanks
just
the
same
we
wo
be
here
long
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
dunark
smilingly
replied
that
he
would
make
his
guests
as
comfortable
as
he
could
and
after
informing
them
that
in
one
kam
he
would
return
and
escort
them
in
to
koprat
took
his
leave
scarcely
had
the
guests
freshened
themselves
when
he
was
back
but
he
was
no
longer
the
dunark
they
had
known
he
now
wore
a
harness
which
was
one
blaze
of
precious
gems
and
a
leather
belt
hung
with
jeweled
weapons
replaced
the
familiar
hollow
girdle
of
metal
his
right
arm
between
the
wrist
and
the
elbow
was
almost
covered
by
six
bracelets
of
a
transparent
metal
deep
in
color
each
set
with
an
incredibly
brilliant
stone
of
the
same
shade
on
his
left
wrist
he
wore
an
osnomian
chronometer
this
was
an
instrument
resembling
the
odometer
of
an
automobile
whose
numerous
revolving
segments
revealed
a
large
and
constantly
increasing
number
the
date
and
time
of
the
osnomian
day
expressed
in
a
decimal
number
of
the
karkamo
of
kondalian
history
greetings
oh
guests
from
earth
i
feel
more
like
myself
now
that
i
am
again
in
my
trappings
and
have
my
weapons
at
my
side
will
you
accompany
me
to
koprat
or
are
you
not
hungry
as
he
attached
the
peculiar
timepieces
to
the
wrists
of
the
guests
with
bracelets
of
the
metal
we
accept
with
thanks
replied
dorothy
promptly
we
starving
to
death
as
usual
as
they
walked
toward
the
dining
hall
dunark
noticed
that
eyes
strayed
toward
his
bracelets
and
he
answered
her
unasked
question
these
are
our
wedding
rings
man
and
wife
exchange
bracelets
as
part
of
the
ceremony
then
you
can
tell
whether
a
man
is
married
or
not
and
how
many
wives
he
has
simply
by
looking
at
his
arm
we
should
have
something
like
that
on
earth
dick
then
married
men
would
find
it
so
easy
to
pose
as
bachelors
roban
met
them
at
the
door
of
the
great
dining
hall
he
also
was
in
full
panoply
and
dorothy
counted
ten
of
the
heavy
bracelets
upon
his
right
arm
as
he
led
them
to
places
near
his
own
the
room
was
a
replica
of
the
other
osnomian
dining
hall
they
had
seen
and
the
women
were
decorated
with
the
same
barbaric
splendor
of
scintillating
gems
after
the
meal
which
was
a
happy
one
taking
the
nature
of
a
celebration
in
honor
of
the
return
of
the
captives
duquesne
went
directly
to
his
room
while
the
others
spent
the
time
until
the
zero
hour
in
strolling
about
the
splendid
grounds
always
escorted
by
many
guards
returning
to
the
room
occupied
by
the
two
girls
the
couples
separated
each
girl
accompanying
her
lover
to
the
door
of
his
room
margaret
was
ill
at
ease
though
trying
hard
to
appear
completely
what
is
the
matter
sweetheart
peggy
asked
crane
solicitously
i
did
know
that
you
she
broke
off
and
continued
with
a
rush
what
did
the
kofedix
mean
just
now
when
he
called
you
the
karfedix
of
wealth
well
you
see
i
happen
to
have
some
money
he
began
then
you
are
the
great
reynolds
crane
she
interrupted
in
consternation
leave
off
great
he
said
then
noting
her
expression
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
laughed
slightly
is
that
all
that
was
bothering
you
what
does
a
little
money
amount
to
between
you
and
me
nothing
but
i
awfully
glad
that
i
did
know
it
before
she
replied
as
she
returned
his
caress
with
fervor
that
is
it
means
nothing
if
you
are
perfectly
sure
i
not
crane
the
imperturbable
broke
a
rule
and
interrupted
her
do
not
say
that
dear
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
between
you
and
me
there
never
have
been
are
not
now
and
never
shall
be
any
doubts
or
any
questions
if
i
could
have
a
real
cold
bath
now
i
feel
fine
remarked
seaton
standing
in
his
own
door
with
dorothy
by
his
side
i
no
blooming
englishman
but
in
weather
as
hot
as
this
i
sure
would
like
to
dive
into
a
good
cold
tank
how
do
you
feel
after
all
this
excitement
dottie
up
to
standard
i
scared
purple
she
replied
nestling
against
him
or
at
least
if
not
exactly
scared
i
apprehensive
and
nervous
i
always
thought
i
had
good
nerves
but
everything
here
is
so
horrible
and
unreal
that
i
ca
help
but
feel
it
when
i
with
you
i
really
enjoy
the
experience
but
when
i
alone
or
with
peggy
especially
in
the
which
is
so
awfully
long
and
when
it
seems
that
something
terrible
is
going
to
happen
every
minute
my
mind
goes
off
in
spite
of
me
into
thoughts
of
what
may
happen
why
last
night
peggy
and
i
just
huddled
up
to
each
other
in
a
ghastly
yellow
funk
dreading
we
knew
not
what
the
two
of
us
slept
hardly
at
all
i
sorry
little
girl
replied
seaton
embracing
her
tenderly
sorrier
than
i
can
say
i
know
that
your
nerves
are
all
right
but
you
have
roughed
it
enough
or
lived
in
strange
environments
enough
to
be
able
to
feel
at
home
the
reason
you
feel
safer
with
me
is
that
i
feel
perfectly
at
home
here
myself
not
that
your
nerves
are
going
to
pieces
or
anything
like
that
it
wo
be
for
long
though
sweetheart
as
soon
as
we
get
the
chariot
fixed
up
we
beat
it
back
to
the
earth
so
fast
it
make
your
head
spin
yes
i
think
that
the
reason
lover
i
hope
you
wo
think
i
a
clinging
vine
but
i
ca
help
being
afraid
of
something
here
every
time
i
away
from
you
you
so
so
perfectly
at
ease
here
that
it
makes
me
feel
the
same
way
i
am
perfectly
at
ease
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
i
been
in
hundreds
of
worse
places
right
on
earth
i
sure
wish
i
could
be
with
you
all
the
time
sweetheart
girl
only
you
can
understand
just
how
much
i
wish
it
but
as
i
said
before
it
wo
be
long
until
we
can
be
together
all
the
time
dorothy
pushed
him
into
his
room
followed
him
within
it
closed
the
door
and
put
both
hands
on
his
arm
dick
sweetheart
she
whispered
while
a
hot
blush
suffused
her
face
you
not
as
dumb
as
i
thought
you
were
you
dumber
but
if
you
simply
wo
say
it
i
will
do
you
know
that
a
marriage
that
is
legal
where
it
is
performed
is
legal
anywhere
and
that
no
law
says
that
the
marriage
must
be
performed
upon
the
earth
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
in
a
mighty
embrace
and
his
low
voice
showed
in
every
vibration
the
depth
of
the
feeling
he
held
for
the
beautiful
woman
in
his
arms
as
he
replied
i
never
thought
of
that
sweetheart
and
i
would
have
dared
mention
it
if
i
had
you
so
far
away
from
your
family
and
your
friends
that
it
would
seem
it
would
seem
anything
of
the
kind
she
broke
in
earnestly
you
see
you
big
dense
wonderful
man
that
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
we
need
each
other
or
at
least
i
need
you
so
much
now
say
other
it
right
declared
her
lover
with
fervor
it
foolish
to
wait
mother
would
like
to
have
seen
me
married
of
course
but
there
will
be
great
advantages
even
on
that
side
a
grand
wedding
of
the
kind
we
would
simply
have
to
have
in
washington
appeal
to
me
any
more
than
it
does
to
you
and
it
would
bore
you
to
extinction
dad
would
hate
it
too
it
better
all
around
to
be
married
here
seaton
who
had
been
trying
to
speak
silenced
her
i
convinced
dottie
have
been
ever
since
the
first
word
if
you
can
see
it
that
way
i
so
glad
that
i
ca
express
it
i
been
scared
stiff
every
time
i
thought
of
our
wedding
i
speak
to
the
karfedix
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
we
be
married
tomorrow
or
rather
today
since
it
is
past
the
zero
kam
as
he
glanced
at
the
chronometer
upon
his
wrist
which
driven
by
wireless
impulses
from
the
in
the
national
observatory
was
clicking
off
the
darkamo
with
an
almost
inaudible
purr
of
its
segments
how
would
it
be
to
wake
him
up
and
have
it
done
now
oh
dick
be
reasonable
that
would
never
do
tomorrow
will
be
most
awfully
sudden
as
it
is
and
dick
please
speak
to
martin
will
you
peggy
even
more
scared
than
i
am
and
martin
the
dear
old
stupid
is
even
less
likely
to
suggest
such
a
thing
as
this
kind
of
a
wedding
than
you
are
peggy
afraid
to
suggest
it
to
him
woman
he
said
in
mock
sternness
is
this
a
job
it
certainly
is
did
you
think
i
had
nerve
enough
to
do
it
without
help
seaton
turned
and
opened
the
door
mart
bring
peggy
over
here
he
called
as
he
led
dorothy
back
into
the
girls
room
heavens
dick
be
careful
you
spoil
the
whole
thing
no
i
wo
leave
it
to
me
i
bashfully
admit
that
i
a
regular
at
this
diplomatic
stuff
watch
my
smoke
folks
he
said
when
the
four
were
together
dottie
and
i
have
been
talking
things
over
and
we
decided
that
today
the
best
possible
date
for
a
wedding
dottie
afraid
of
these
long
daylight
nights
and
i
admit
that
i
sleep
a
lot
sounder
if
i
knew
where
she
was
all
the
time
instead
of
only
part
of
it
she
says
she
willing
provided
you
folks
see
it
the
same
way
and
make
it
double
how
about
it
margaret
blushed
furiously
and
crane
lean
handsome
face
assumed
a
darker
color
as
he
replied
a
marriage
here
would
of
course
be
legal
anywhere
provided
we
have
a
certificate
and
we
could
be
married
again
upon
our
return
if
we
think
it
desirable
it
might
look
as
though
we
were
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
the
girls
dick
but
considering
all
the
circumstances
i
think
it
would
be
the
best
thing
for
everyone
concerned
he
saw
the
supreme
joy
in
margaret
eyes
and
his
own
assumed
a
new
light
as
he
drew
her
into
the
hollow
of
his
arm
peggy
has
known
me
only
a
short
time
but
nothing
else
in
the
world
is
as
certain
as
our
love
it
is
the
bride
privilege
to
set
the
date
so
i
will
only
say
that
it
can
not
be
too
soon
for
me
the
sooner
the
better
said
margaret
with
a
blush
that
would
have
been
divine
in
any
earthly
light
did
you
say
dick
i
see
the
karfedix
as
soon
as
he
gets
up
he
answered
and
walked
with
dorothy
to
his
door
i
just
too
supremely
happy
for
words
dorothy
whispered
in
ear
as
he
bade
her
i
wo
be
able
to
sleep
or
anything
chapter
xvi
an
osnomian
marriage
seaton
awoke
hot
and
uncomfortable
but
with
a
great
surge
of
joy
in
his
heart
this
was
his
wedding
day
springing
from
the
bed
he
released
the
full
stream
of
the
cold
water
filling
the
tank
in
a
few
moments
poising
lightly
upon
the
edge
he
made
a
clean
sharp
dive
and
yelled
in
surprise
as
he
came
snorting
to
the
surface
for
dunark
had
made
good
his
promise
the
water
was
only
a
few
degrees
above
the
freezing
point
after
a
few
minutes
of
vigorous
splashing
in
the
icy
water
he
rubbed
himself
down
with
a
coarse
towel
shaved
threw
on
his
clothes
and
lifted
his
powerful
but
musical
bass
voice
in
the
wedding
chorus
from
the
rose
maiden
rise
sweet
maid
arise
arise
rise
sweet
maid
arise
arise
is
the
last
fair
morning
for
thy
maiden
eyes
he
sang
lustily
out
of
his
sheer
joy
in
being
alive
and
was
surprised
to
hear
dorothy
clear
soprano
margaret
pleasing
contralto
and
crane
mellow
tenor
chime
in
from
the
adjoining
room
crane
threw
open
the
door
and
seaton
joined
the
others
good
morning
dick
you
sound
happy
said
crane
who
would
be
look
what
doing
today
as
he
ardently
embraced
his
besides
i
found
some
cold
water
this
morning
everyone
in
the
palace
heard
you
discovering
it
dryly
returned
crane
and
the
girls
laughed
merrily
it
surprised
me
at
first
admitted
seaton
but
it
great
after
a
fellow
once
gets
wet
we
warmed
ours
a
trifle
said
dorothy
i
like
a
cold
bath
myself
but
not
in
all
four
became
silent
thinking
of
the
coming
event
of
the
day
until
crane
said
they
have
ministers
here
i
know
and
i
know
something
of
their
religion
but
my
knowledge
is
rather
vague
you
know
more
about
it
than
we
do
dick
suppose
you
tell
us
about
it
while
we
wait
seaton
paused
a
moment
with
an
odd
look
on
his
face
as
one
turning
the
pages
of
an
unfamiliar
book
of
reference
he
was
seeking
the
answer
to
crane
question
in
the
vast
store
of
osnomian
information
received
from
dunark
his
usually
ready
speech
came
a
little
slowly
well
as
nearly
as
i
can
explain
it
it
a
funny
kind
of
a
mixture
partly
theology
partly
darwinism
or
at
least
making
a
fetish
of
evolution
and
partly
pure
economic
determinism
they
believe
in
a
supreme
being
whom
they
call
the
first
cause
that
is
the
nearest
english
equivalent
and
they
recognize
the
existence
of
an
immortal
and
unknowable
or
soul
they
believe
that
the
first
cause
has
decreed
the
survival
of
the
fittest
as
the
fundamental
law
which
belief
accounts
for
their
perfect
physiques
perfect
physiques
why
they
as
weak
as
children
interrupted
dorothy
yes
but
that
is
because
of
the
smallness
of
the
planet
returned
seaton
you
see
a
man
of
my
size
weighs
only
pounds
here
on
a
spring
balance
so
he
would
need
only
the
muscular
development
of
a
boy
of
twelve
or
so
in
a
contest
of
strength
either
of
you
girls
could
easily
handle
two
of
the
strongest
men
upon
osnome
in
fact
the
average
osnomian
could
stand
up
on
our
earth
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
but
that
is
the
fault
of
the
people
they
are
magnificently
developed
for
their
surroundings
they
have
attained
this
condition
by
centuries
of
weeding
out
the
unfit
they
have
no
hospitals
for
the
or
abnormal
persons
are
not
allowed
to
live
the
same
reasoning
accounts
for
their
perfect
cleanliness
moral
and
physical
vice
is
practically
unknown
they
believe
that
clean
living
and
clean
thinking
are
rewarded
by
the
production
of
a
better
physical
and
mental
type
yes
especially
as
they
correct
wrong
living
by
those
terrible
punishments
the
kofedix
told
us
about
interrupted
margaret
that
probably
helps
some
they
also
believe
that
the
higher
the
type
is
the
faster
will
evolution
proceed
and
the
sooner
will
mankind
reach
what
they
call
the
ultimate
goal
and
know
all
things
believing
as
they
do
that
the
fittest
must
survive
and
thinking
themselves
of
course
the
superior
type
it
is
ordained
that
mardonale
must
be
destroyed
utterly
root
and
branch
they
believe
that
the
slaves
are
so
low
in
the
scale
millions
of
years
behind
in
evolution
that
they
do
not
count
slaves
are
simply
intelligent
and
docile
animals
little
more
than
horses
or
oxen
mardonalians
and
savages
are
unfit
to
survive
and
must
be
exterminated
their
ministers
are
chosen
from
the
very
fittest
they
are
the
strongest
and
most
vigorous
men
of
this
clean
and
vigorous
nation
and
are
usually
high
army
officers
as
well
as
ministers
an
attendant
announced
the
coming
of
the
karfedix
and
his
son
to
pay
the
call
of
state
after
the
ceremonious
greetings
had
been
exchanged
all
went
into
the
dining
hall
for
darprat
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
seaton
brought
up
the
question
of
the
double
wedding
that
kokam
and
the
karfedix
was
overjoyed
karfedix
seaton
he
said
earnestly
nothing
could
please
us
more
than
to
have
such
a
ceremony
performed
in
our
palace
marriage
between
such
persons
as
are
you
four
is
wished
by
the
first
cause
whose
servants
we
are
aside
from
that
it
is
an
honor
for
any
ruler
to
have
even
one
karfedix
married
beneath
his
roof
and
you
are
granting
me
the
privilege
of
two
i
thank
you
and
assure
you
that
we
will
do
our
poor
best
to
make
the
occasion
memorable
do
do
anything
fancy
said
seaton
hastily
a
simple
plain
wedding
will
do
unheeding
seaton
remark
the
karfedix
took
his
wireless
from
its
hook
at
his
belt
and
sent
a
brief
message
i
have
summoned
karbix
tarnan
to
perform
the
ceremony
our
usual
time
for
ceremonies
is
just
before
koprat
is
that
time
satisfactory
to
you
assured
that
it
was
he
turned
to
his
son
dunark
you
are
more
familiar
than
i
with
the
customs
of
our
illustrious
visitors
may
i
ask
you
to
take
charge
of
the
details
while
dunark
sent
a
rapid
succession
of
messages
dorothy
whispered
to
seaton
they
must
be
going
to
make
a
real
function
of
our
double
wedding
dick
the
karbix
is
the
highest
dignitary
of
the
church
is
he
yes
in
addition
to
being
the
of
all
the
kondalian
armies
next
to
the
karfedix
he
is
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
empire
something
tells
me
dottie
that
this
is
going
to
be
some
ceremony
as
dunark
finished
telegraphing
seaton
turned
to
him
dorothy
said
a
while
ago
that
she
would
like
to
have
enough
of
that
for
a
dress
do
you
suppose
it
could
be
managed
certainly
in
all
state
ceremonials
we
always
wear
robes
made
out
of
the
same
fabric
as
the
tapestries
but
much
finer
and
more
delicate
i
would
have
suggested
it
but
thought
perhaps
the
ladies
would
prefer
their
usual
clothing
i
know
that
you
two
men
do
not
care
to
wear
our
robes
we
will
wear
white
ducks
the
dressiest
and
coolest
things
we
have
along
replied
seaton
thank
you
for
your
offer
but
you
know
how
it
is
we
should
feel
out
of
place
in
such
gorgeous
dress
i
understand
i
will
call
in
a
few
of
our
most
expert
who
will
weave
the
gowns
before
they
come
let
us
decide
upon
the
ceremony
i
think
you
are
familiar
with
our
marriage
customs
but
i
will
explain
them
to
make
sure
each
couple
is
married
twice
the
first
marriage
is
symbolized
by
the
exchange
of
plain
bracelets
and
lasts
four
karkamo
during
which
period
divorce
may
be
obtained
at
will
the
children
of
such
divorced
couples
formerly
became
wards
of
the
state
but
in
my
lifetime
i
have
not
heard
of
there
being
any
such
children
all
divorces
are
now
between
couples
who
discover
their
incompatibility
before
children
are
conceived
that
surprises
me
greatly
said
crane
some
system
of
is
advocated
among
us
on
earth
every
few
years
but
they
all
so
surely
degenerate
into
free
love
that
no
such
system
has
found
a
foothold
we
are
not
troubled
in
that
way
at
all
you
see
before
the
first
marriage
each
couple
from
the
humblest
peasantry
to
the
highest
royalty
must
submit
to
a
mental
examination
if
they
are
marrying
for
any
reason
at
all
other
than
love
such
as
any
thought
of
trifling
in
the
mind
of
the
man
or
if
the
woman
is
marrying
him
for
his
wealth
or
position
he
or
she
is
summarily
executed
regardless
of
station
no
other
questions
being
asked
dunark
continued
at
the
end
of
four
karkamo
the
second
marriage
is
performed
which
is
indissoluble
in
this
ceremony
jeweled
bracelets
are
substituted
for
the
plain
ones
in
the
case
of
persons
it
is
permitted
that
the
two
ceremonies
be
combined
into
one
then
there
is
a
third
ceremony
used
only
in
the
marriage
of
persons
of
the
very
highest
evolution
in
which
the
vows
are
taken
and
the
faidon
the
eternal
jewel
is
exchanged
as
you
are
all
in
the
permitted
class
you
may
use
the
eternal
ceremony
if
you
wish
i
think
we
all
know
our
minds
well
enough
to
know
that
we
want
to
be
married
for
good
the
longer
the
better
said
seaton
positively
we
make
it
the
eternal
wo
we
folks
i
should
like
to
ask
one
question
said
crane
thoughtfully
does
that
ceremony
imply
that
my
wife
would
be
breaking
her
vows
if
she
married
again
upon
my
death
far
from
it
numbers
of
our
men
are
killed
every
karkam
their
wives
if
of
marriageable
age
are
expected
to
marry
again
then
too
you
know
that
most
kondalian
men
have
several
wives
no
matter
how
many
wives
or
husbands
may
be
linked
together
in
that
way
it
merely
means
that
after
death
their
spirits
will
be
grouped
into
one
just
as
in
your
chemistry
smiling
in
comradely
fashion
at
seaton
a
varying
number
of
elements
may
unite
to
form
a
stable
compound
after
a
short
pause
the
speaker
went
on
since
you
are
from
the
earth
and
unaccustomed
to
bracelets
rings
will
be
substituted
for
them
the
plain
rings
will
take
the
place
of
your
earthly
wedding
rings
the
jeweled
ones
that
of
your
engagement
rings
the
only
difference
is
that
while
we
discard
the
plain
bracelets
you
will
continue
to
wear
them
have
you
men
any
objections
to
wearing
the
rings
during
the
ceremony
you
may
discard
them
later
if
you
wish
and
still
keep
the
marriage
valid
not
i
i
wear
mine
all
my
life
responded
seaton
earnestly
and
crane
expressed
the
same
thought
there
is
only
one
more
thing
added
the
kofedix
that
is
about
the
mental
examination
since
it
is
not
your
custom
it
is
probable
that
the
justices
would
waive
the
ruling
especially
since
everyone
must
be
examined
by
a
jury
of
his
own
or
a
superior
rank
so
that
only
one
man
my
father
alone
could
examine
you
not
in
a
thousand
years
replied
seaton
emphatically
i
want
to
be
examined
and
have
dorothy
see
the
record
i
do
care
about
having
her
put
through
it
but
i
want
her
to
know
exactly
the
kind
of
a
guy
she
is
getting
dorothy
protested
at
this
but
as
all
four
were
eager
that
they
themselves
should
be
tested
the
karfedix
was
notified
and
dunark
clamped
sets
of
multiple
electrodes
connected
to
a
set
of
instruments
upon
the
temples
of
his
father
dorothy
and
seaton
he
pressed
a
lever
and
instantly
dorothy
and
seaton
read
each
other
minds
to
the
minutest
detail
and
each
knew
that
the
karfedix
was
reading
the
minds
of
both
after
margaret
and
crane
had
been
examined
the
karfedix
expressed
himself
as
more
than
satisfied
you
are
all
of
the
highest
evolution
and
your
minds
are
all
untainted
by
any
base
thoughts
in
your
marriage
the
first
cause
will
smile
upon
your
unions
he
said
solemnly
let
the
appear
the
karfedix
ordered
and
four
women
hung
with
spools
of
wire
of
incredible
fineness
and
with
peculiar
looms
under
their
arms
entered
the
room
and
accompanied
the
two
girls
to
their
apartment
as
soon
as
the
room
was
empty
save
for
the
four
men
dunark
said
while
i
was
in
mardonale
i
heard
bits
of
conversation
regarding
an
immense
military
discovery
possessed
by
nalboon
besides
the
gas
whose
deadly
effects
we
felt
i
could
get
no
inkling
of
its
nature
but
feel
sure
that
it
is
something
to
be
dreaded
i
also
heard
that
both
of
these
secrets
had
been
stolen
from
kondal
and
that
we
were
to
be
destroyed
by
our
own
superior
inventions
the
karfedix
nodded
his
head
gloomily
that
is
true
my
son
partly
true
at
least
we
shall
not
be
destroyed
however
kondal
shall
triumph
the
discoveries
were
made
by
a
kondalian
but
i
am
as
ignorant
as
are
you
concerning
their
nature
an
obscure
inventor
living
close
to
the
bordering
ocean
was
the
discoverer
he
was
rash
enough
to
wireless
me
concerning
them
he
would
not
reveal
their
nature
but
requested
a
guard
the
mardonalian
patrol
intercepted
the
message
and
captured
both
him
and
his
discoveries
before
our
guard
could
arrive
that
easily
fixed
suggested
seaton
let
get
the
skylark
fixed
up
and
we
go
jerk
nalboon
out
of
his
palace
if
he
still
alive
bring
him
over
here
and
read
his
mind
that
might
prove
feasible
answered
the
kofedix
and
in
any
event
we
must
repair
the
skylark
and
replenish
her
supply
of
copper
immediately
that
must
be
our
first
consideration
so
that
you
our
guests
will
have
a
protection
in
any
emergency
the
karfedix
went
to
his
duties
and
the
other
three
made
their
way
to
the
wrecked
they
found
that
besides
the
damage
done
to
the
hull
many
of
the
instruments
were
broken
including
one
of
the
focused
upon
the
earth
it
a
good
thing
you
had
three
of
them
mart
i
sure
hand
it
to
you
for
preparedness
said
seaton
as
he
tossed
the
broken
instruments
out
upon
the
dock
dunark
protested
at
this
treatment
and
placed
the
discarded
instruments
in
a
strong
metal
safe
remarking
these
things
may
prove
useful
at
some
future
time
well
i
suppose
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
get
some
powerful
jacks
and
straighten
these
plates
said
seaton
why
not
throw
away
this
soft
metal
steel
and
build
it
of
arenak
as
it
should
be
built
you
have
plenty
of
salt
suggested
dunark
fine
we
have
lots
of
salt
in
the
galley
have
we
mart
yes
nearly
a
hundred
pounds
we
are
stocked
for
emergencies
with
two
years
supply
of
food
you
know
dunark
eyes
opened
in
astonishment
at
the
amount
mentioned
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
of
earthly
conditions
he
started
to
say
something
then
stopped
in
confusion
but
seaton
divined
his
thought
we
can
spare
him
fifty
pounds
as
well
as
not
ca
we
mart
certainly
fifty
pounds
of
salt
is
a
ridiculously
cheap
price
for
what
he
is
doing
for
us
even
though
it
is
very
rare
here
dunark
acknowledged
the
gift
with
shining
eyes
and
heartfelt
but
not
profuse
thanks
and
bore
the
precious
bag
to
the
palace
under
a
heavy
escort
he
returned
with
a
small
army
of
workmen
and
after
making
tests
to
assure
himself
that
the
would
work
as
well
through
arenak
as
through
steel
he
instructed
the
officers
concerning
the
work
to
be
done
as
the
wonderfully
skilled
mechanics
set
to
work
without
a
single
useless
motion
the
prince
stood
silent
with
a
look
of
care
upon
his
handsome
face
worrying
about
mardonale
dunark
yes
i
can
not
help
wondering
what
that
terrible
new
engine
of
destruction
is
which
nalboon
now
has
at
his
command
say
why
do
you
build
a
bus
like
the
skylark
and
blow
mardonale
off
the
map
building
the
vessel
would
be
easy
enough
but
x
is
as
yet
unknown
upon
osnome
we
got
a
lot
of
it
i
could
not
accept
it
the
salt
was
different
since
you
have
plenty
x
however
is
as
scarce
upon
earth
as
salt
is
upon
osnome
sure
you
can
accept
it
we
stopped
at
a
planet
that
has
lots
of
it
and
we
got
an
pointing
at
it
so
that
we
can
go
back
and
get
more
of
it
any
time
we
want
it
we
got
more
of
it
on
hand
now
than
we
apt
to
need
for
a
long
time
so
have
a
hunk
and
get
busy
and
he
easily
carried
one
of
the
lumps
out
of
his
cabin
and
tossed
it
upon
the
dock
from
whence
it
required
two
of
kondal
strongest
men
to
lift
it
the
look
of
care
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
prince
and
he
summoned
another
corps
of
mechanics
how
thick
shall
the
walls
be
our
battleships
are
armed
with
arenak
the
thickness
of
a
hand
but
with
your
vast
supply
of
salt
you
may
have
it
any
thickness
you
wish
since
the
materials
of
the
matrix
are
cheap
and
abundant
one
inch
would
be
enough
but
everything
in
the
bus
is
designed
for
a
shell
and
if
we
change
it
from
four
feet
we
have
to
redesign
our
guns
and
all
our
instruments
let
make
it
four
feet
seaton
turned
to
the
crippled
skylark
upon
which
the
first
crew
of
kondalian
mechanics
were
working
with
skill
and
with
tools
upon
earth
the
whole
interior
of
the
vessel
was
supported
by
a
complex
falsework
of
latticed
metal
then
the
steel
plates
and
the
mighty
embers
the
pride
of
the
great
macdougall
were
cut
away
as
though
they
were
made
of
paper
by
revolving
saws
and
enormous
power
shears
the
sphere
grooved
for
the
repellers
and
with
the
members
braces
and
central
machinery
complete
of
the
exact
dimensions
of
the
originals
was
rapidly
moulded
of
a
stiff
plastic
substance
resembling
clay
this
matrix
soon
hardened
into
a
mass
into
which
the
doors
emplacements
and
other
openings
were
carefully
cut
all
surfaces
were
then
washed
with
a
dilute
solution
of
salt
which
the
workmen
handled
as
though
it
were
radium
two
great
plates
of
platinum
were
clamped
into
place
upon
either
side
of
the
vessel
each
plate
connected
by
means
of
silver
cables
as
large
as
a
man
leg
to
the
receiving
terminal
of
an
enormous
wireless
power
station
the
current
was
applied
and
the
great
spherical
mass
apparently
disappeared
being
transformed
instantly
into
the
transparent
metal
arenak
then
indeed
had
the
a
vehicle
such
as
had
never
been
seen
before
a
shell
of
metal
five
hundred
times
as
strong
and
hard
as
the
strongest
and
hardest
steel
cast
in
one
piece
with
the
sustaining
framework
designed
by
the
world
foremost
engineer
a
structure
that
no
conceivable
force
could
deform
or
injure
housing
an
inconceivable
propulsive
force
the
falsework
was
rapidly
removed
and
the
sustaining
framework
was
painted
with
opaque
varnish
to
render
it
plainly
visible
at
suggestion
the
walls
of
the
cabins
were
also
painted
leaving
transparent
several
small
areas
to
serve
as
windows
the
second
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
as
seaton
and
crane
were
to
be
married
before
koprat
they
stopped
work
they
marveled
at
the
amount
that
had
been
accomplished
and
the
kofedix
told
them
both
vessels
will
be
finished
tomorrow
except
for
the
controlling
instruments
which
we
will
have
to
make
ourselves
another
crew
will
work
during
the
installing
the
guns
and
other
fittings
do
you
wish
to
have
your
own
guns
installed
or
guns
of
our
pattern
you
are
familiar
with
them
now
our
own
please
they
are
slower
and
less
efficient
than
yours
but
we
are
used
to
them
and
have
a
lot
of
ammunition
for
them
replied
seaton
after
a
short
conference
with
crane
after
instructing
the
officers
in
charge
of
the
work
the
three
returned
to
the
palace
the
hearts
of
two
of
them
beating
high
in
anticipation
seaton
went
into
crane
room
accompanied
by
two
attendants
bearing
his
suitcase
and
other
luggage
we
should
have
brought
along
dress
clothes
mart
why
did
you
think
of
that
too
nothing
like
this
ever
entered
my
mind
it
is
a
good
thing
we
brought
along
ducks
and
white
soft
shirts
i
must
say
that
this
is
extremely
informal
garb
for
a
state
wedding
but
since
the
natives
are
ignorant
of
our
customs
it
will
not
make
any
difference
that
right
too
we
make
think
it
the
most
formal
kind
of
dress
dunark
knows
what
what
but
he
knows
that
full
dress
would
be
unbearable
here
we
melt
down
in
a
minute
it
plenty
hot
enough
as
it
is
with
only
duck
trousers
and
on
they
look
green
instead
of
white
but
that
a
small
matter
dunark
as
best
man
entered
the
room
some
time
later
give
us
a
look
dunark
begged
seaton
and
see
if
we
pass
inspection
i
was
never
so
rattled
in
my
life
they
were
clad
in
spotless
white
from
their
duck
oxfords
to
the
white
ties
encircling
the
open
collars
of
their
tennis
shirts
the
two
tall
figures
crane
slender
wiry
at
perfect
ease
powerful
prowling
about
with
unconscious
feline
suppleness
and
grace
and
the
two
handsome
intellectual
faces
each
wearing
a
look
of
eager
happiness
fully
justified
answer
you
sure
will
do
he
pronounced
enthusiastically
and
with
own
impulsive
good
will
he
shook
hands
and
wished
them
an
eternity
of
happiness
when
you
have
spoken
with
your
brides
he
continued
i
shall
be
waiting
to
escort
you
into
the
chapel
sitar
told
me
to
say
that
the
ladies
are
ready
dorothy
and
margaret
had
been
dressed
in
their
bridal
gowns
by
sitar
and
several
other
princesses
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
karfedir
herself
sitar
placed
the
two
girls
side
by
side
and
drew
off
to
survey
her
work
you
are
the
loveliest
creatures
in
the
whole
world
she
cried
they
looked
at
each
other
glittering
gowns
then
margaret
glanced
at
dorothy
face
and
a
look
of
dismay
overspread
her
own
oh
dottie
she
gasped
your
lovely
complexion
is
it
terrible
for
the
boys
to
see
us
in
this
light
there
was
a
peal
of
delighted
laughter
from
sitar
and
she
spoke
to
one
of
the
servants
who
drew
dark
curtains
across
the
windows
and
pressed
a
switch
flooding
the
room
with
brilliant
white
light
dunark
installed
lamps
like
those
of
your
ship
for
you
she
explained
with
intense
satisfaction
i
knew
in
advance
just
how
you
would
feel
about
your
color
before
the
girls
had
time
to
thank
their
thoughtful
hostess
she
disappeared
and
their
bridegrooms
stood
before
them
for
a
moment
no
word
was
spoken
seaton
stared
at
dorothy
hungrily
almost
doubting
the
evidence
of
his
senses
for
white
was
white
pink
was
pink
and
her
hair
shone
in
all
its
natural
splendor
of
burnished
bronze
in
their
wondrous
osnomian
bridal
robes
the
beautiful
stood
before
their
lovers
upon
their
feet
were
jeweled
slippers
their
lovely
bodies
were
clothed
in
softly
shimmering
garments
that
left
their
rounded
arms
and
throats
bare
garments
infinitely
more
supple
than
the
finest
silk
of
metallic
threads
of
such
fineness
that
the
individual
wires
were
visible
only
under
a
lens
garments
that
floated
and
clung
about
their
perfect
forms
in
lines
of
exquisite
grace
for
margaret
with
her
ivory
skin
the
kondalian
princess
had
chosen
a
background
of
a
rare
white
metal
upon
which
in
complicated
figures
glistened
numberless
jewels
of
pale
colors
more
brilliant
than
diamonds
dorothy
dress
was
of
a
peculiar
shade
by
an
intricate
design
of
blazing
green
gems
the
strange
luminous
jewels
of
this
strange
world
both
girls
wore
their
long
heavy
hair
unbound
after
the
kondalian
bridal
fashion
brushed
until
it
fell
like
mist
about
them
and
confined
at
the
temples
by
metallic
bands
entirely
covered
with
jewels
seaton
looked
from
dorothy
to
margaret
and
back
again
looked
down
into
her
violet
eyes
deep
with
wonder
and
with
love
more
beautiful
than
any
jewel
in
all
her
gorgeous
costume
unheeding
the
presence
of
the
others
she
put
her
dainty
hands
upon
his
mighty
shoulders
and
stood
on
tiptoe
i
love
you
dick
now
and
always
here
or
at
home
or
anywhere
in
the
universe
we
never
be
parted
again
she
whispered
and
her
own
beloved
violin
had
no
sweeter
tones
than
had
her
voice
a
few
minutes
later
her
eyes
wet
and
shining
she
drew
herself
away
from
him
and
glanced
at
margaret
is
she
the
most
beautiful
thing
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
no
seaton
answered
promptly
she
is
not
but
poor
old
mart
thinks
she
is
accompanied
by
the
karfedix
and
his
son
seaton
and
crane
went
into
the
chapel
which
already
brilliant
had
been
decorated
anew
with
even
greater
splendor
glancing
through
the
wide
arches
they
saw
for
the
first
time
osnomians
clothed
the
great
room
was
filled
with
the
highest
nobility
of
kondal
wearing
their
resplendent
robes
of
state
every
color
of
the
rainbow
and
numberless
fantastic
patterns
were
there
embodied
in
the
soft
lustrous
metallic
fabric
as
the
men
entered
one
door
dorothy
and
margaret
with
the
karfedir
and
sitar
entered
the
other
and
the
entire
assemblage
rose
to
its
feet
and
snapped
into
the
grand
salute
moving
to
the
accompaniment
of
strange
martial
music
from
concealed
instruments
the
two
parties
approached
each
other
meeting
at
the
raised
platform
or
pulpit
where
karbix
tarnan
a
handsome
stately
man
who
carried
easily
his
hundred
and
fifty
karkamo
of
age
awaited
them
as
he
raised
his
arms
the
music
ceased
it
was
a
solemn
and
wonderfully
impressive
spectacle
the
room
of
burnished
metal
with
its
bizarre
decorations
wrought
in
scintillating
gems
the
constantly
changing
harmony
of
colors
as
the
invisible
lamps
were
shifted
from
one
shade
to
another
the
group
of
mighty
nobles
standing
rigidly
at
attention
in
a
silence
so
profound
that
it
was
an
utter
absence
of
everything
audible
as
the
karbix
lifted
both
arms
in
a
silent
invocation
of
the
great
first
cause
all
these
things
deepened
the
solemnity
of
that
solemn
moment
when
tarnan
spoke
his
voice
deep
with
some
great
feeling
inexplicable
even
to
those
who
knew
him
best
carried
clearly
to
every
part
of
the
great
chamber
friends
it
is
our
privilege
to
assist
today
in
a
most
notable
event
the
marriage
of
four
personages
from
another
world
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
osnome
one
karfedix
has
the
privilege
of
entertaining
the
bridal
party
of
another
it
is
not
for
this
fact
alone
however
that
this
occasion
is
to
be
memorable
a
far
deeper
reason
is
that
we
are
witnessing
possibly
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
universe
the
meeting
upon
terms
of
mutual
fellowship
and
understanding
of
the
inhabitants
of
two
worlds
separated
by
unthinkable
distances
of
trackless
space
and
by
equally
great
differences
in
evolution
conditions
of
life
and
environment
yet
these
strangers
are
actuated
by
the
spirit
of
good
faith
and
honor
which
is
instilled
into
every
worthy
being
by
the
great
first
cause
in
the
working
out
of
whose
vast
projects
all
things
are
humble
instruments
in
honor
of
the
friendship
of
the
two
worlds
we
will
proceed
with
the
ceremony
richard
seaton
and
martin
crane
exchange
the
plain
rings
with
dorothy
vaneman
and
margaret
spencer
they
did
so
and
repeated
after
the
karbix
simple
vows
of
love
and
loyalty
may
the
first
cause
smile
upon
this
temporary
marriage
and
render
it
worthy
of
being
made
permanent
as
a
lowly
servant
of
the
first
cause
i
pronounce
you
two
and
you
two
husband
and
wife
but
we
must
remember
that
the
dull
vision
of
mortal
man
can
not
pierce
the
veil
of
futurity
which
is
as
crystal
to
the
eye
of
the
first
cause
though
you
love
each
other
truly
unforeseen
things
may
come
between
you
to
mar
the
perfection
of
your
happiness
therefore
a
time
is
granted
you
during
which
you
may
discover
whether
or
not
your
unions
are
perfect
a
pause
ensued
then
tarnan
went
on
martin
crane
margaret
spencer
richard
seaton
and
dorothy
vaneman
you
are
before
us
to
take
the
final
vows
which
shall
bind
your
bodies
together
for
life
and
your
spirits
together
for
eternity
have
you
considered
the
gravity
of
this
step
sufficiently
to
enter
into
this
marriage
without
reservation
i
have
solemnly
replied
the
four
in
unison
exchange
the
jeweled
rings
do
you
richard
seaton
and
dorothy
vaneman
and
you
martin
crane
and
margaret
spencer
individually
swear
here
in
the
presence
of
the
first
cause
and
that
of
the
supreme
justices
of
kondal
that
you
will
be
true
and
loyal
each
helping
his
chosen
one
in
all
things
great
and
small
that
never
throughout
eternity
in
thought
or
in
action
will
either
your
body
or
your
mind
or
your
conscious
spirit
stray
from
the
path
of
fairness
and
truth
and
honor
i
do
i
pronounce
you
married
with
the
eternal
marriage
just
as
the
faidon
which
you
each
now
wear
the
eternal
jewel
which
no
force
of
man
however
applied
has
yet
been
able
to
change
or
deform
in
any
particular
and
which
continues
to
give
off
its
inward
light
without
change
throughout
eternity
shall
endure
through
endless
cycles
of
time
after
the
metal
of
the
ring
which
holds
it
shall
have
crumbled
in
decay
even
so
shall
your
spirits
formerly
two
now
one
and
indissoluble
progress
in
evolution
throughout
eternity
after
the
base
material
which
is
your
bodies
shall
have
returned
to
the
senseless
dust
from
whence
it
arose
the
karbix
lowered
his
arms
and
the
bridal
party
walked
to
the
door
through
a
double
rank
of
uplifted
weapons
from
the
chapel
they
were
led
to
another
room
where
the
contracting
parties
signed
their
names
in
a
register
the
kofedix
then
brought
forward
two
marriage
certificates
heavy
square
plates
of
a
brilliant
purple
metal
beautifully
engraved
in
parallel
columns
of
english
and
kondalian
script
and
heavily
bordered
with
precious
stones
the
principals
and
witnesses
signed
below
each
column
the
signatures
being
deeply
engraved
by
the
royal
engraver
leaving
the
registry
they
were
escorted
to
the
dining
hall
where
a
truly
royal
repast
was
served
between
courses
the
highest
nobles
of
the
nation
welcomed
the
visitors
and
wished
them
happiness
in
short
but
earnest
addresses
after
the
last
course
had
been
disposed
of
the
karbix
rose
at
a
sign
from
the
karfedix
and
spoke
his
voice
again
agitated
by
the
emotion
which
had
puzzled
his
hearers
during
the
marriage
service
all
kondal
is
with
us
here
in
spirit
trying
to
aid
us
in
our
poor
attempts
to
convey
our
welcome
to
these
our
guests
of
whose
friendship
no
greater
warrant
could
be
given
than
their
willingness
to
grant
us
the
privilege
of
their
marriage
not
only
have
they
given
us
a
boon
that
will
make
their
names
revered
throughout
the
nation
as
long
as
kondal
shall
exist
but
they
have
also
been
the
means
of
showing
us
plainly
that
the
first
cause
is
upon
our
side
that
our
institution
of
honor
is
in
truth
the
only
foundation
upon
which
can
be
built
a
race
fitted
to
survive
at
the
same
time
they
have
been
the
means
of
showing
us
that
our
hated
foe
entirely
without
honor
building
his
race
upon
a
foundation
of
bloodthirsty
savagery
alone
is
building
wrongly
and
must
perish
utterly
from
the
face
of
osnome
his
hearers
listened
impressed
by
his
earnestness
but
plainly
not
understanding
his
meaning
you
do
not
understand
he
went
on
with
a
deep
light
shining
in
his
eyes
it
is
inevitable
that
two
peoples
inhabiting
worlds
so
widely
separated
as
are
our
two
should
be
possessed
of
knowledge
and
abilities
and
these
strangers
have
already
made
it
possible
for
us
to
construct
engines
of
destruction
which
shall
obliterate
mardonale
completely
a
fierce
shout
of
joy
interrupted
the
speaker
and
the
nobles
sprang
to
their
feet
saluting
the
visitors
with
upraised
weapons
as
soon
as
they
had
reseated
themselves
the
karbix
continued
that
is
the
boon
the
vindication
of
our
system
of
evolution
is
easily
explained
the
strangers
landed
first
upon
mardonale
had
nalboon
met
them
in
honor
he
would
have
gained
the
boon
but
he
with
the
savagery
characteristic
of
his
evolution
attempted
to
kill
his
guests
and
steal
their
treasures
with
what
results
you
already
know
we
on
our
part
in
exchange
for
the
few
and
trifling
services
we
have
been
able
to
render
them
have
received
even
more
than
nalboon
would
have
obtained
had
his
plans
not
been
nullified
by
their
vastly
superior
state
of
evolution
the
orator
seated
himself
and
there
was
a
deafening
clamor
of
cheering
as
the
nobles
formed
themselves
into
an
escort
of
honor
and
conducted
the
two
couples
to
their
apartments
alone
in
their
room
dorothy
turned
to
her
husband
with
tears
shining
in
her
beautiful
eyes
dick
sweetheart
was
that
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
anybody
ever
heard
of
using
the
word
in
all
its
real
meaning
it
was
indescribably
grand
and
that
old
man
is
simply
superb
it
makes
me
ashamed
of
myself
to
think
that
i
was
ever
afraid
or
nervous
here
it
sure
was
all
of
that
dottie
mine
little
bride
of
an
hour
the
whole
thing
gets
right
down
to
where
a
fellow
lives
i
got
a
lump
in
my
throat
right
now
so
big
that
it
hurts
me
to
think
earthly
marriages
are
piffling
in
comparison
with
that
ceremony
it
no
wonder
happy
after
taking
those
vows
especially
as
they
do
have
to
take
them
until
after
they
are
sure
of
themselves
but
we
sure
already
sweetheart
as
he
embraced
her
with
all
the
feeling
of
his
nature
those
vows
are
not
a
bit
stronger
than
the
ones
we
have
already
exchanged
bodily
and
mentally
and
spiritually
we
are
one
now
and
forever
chapter

bird
beast
or
fish
these
jewels
rather
puzzle
me
dick
what
are
they
asked
martin
as
the
four
assembled
waiting
for
the
first
meal
as
he
spoke
he
held
up
his
third
finger
upon
which
gleamed
the
royal
jewel
of
osnome
in
its
splendid
belcher
mounting
of
arenak
as
transparent
as
the
jewel
itself
and
having
the
same
intense
blue
color
i
know
the
name
but
that
all
i
seem
to
know
that
about
all
that
anybody
knows
about
them
it
is
a
crystal
just
as
you
see
it
there
deep
blue
perfectly
transparent
intensely
refractive
and
constantly
emitting
that
strong
blue
light
it
is
so
hard
that
it
can
not
be
worked
cut
or
ground
no
amount
of
the
hardest
known
abrasive
will
even
roughen
its
surface
no
blow
however
great
will
break
it
it
merely
forces
its
way
into
the
material
of
the
hammer
however
hard
the
hammer
may
be
no
extremity
of
either
heat
or
cold
affects
it
in
any
degree
it
is
the
same
when
in
the
most
powerful
electric
arc
as
it
is
when
immersed
in
liquid
helium
how
about
acids
that
is
what
i
am
asking
myself
osnomians
are
much
force
at
chemistry
i
going
to
try
to
get
hold
of
another
one
and
see
if
i
ca
analyze
it
just
for
fun
i
ca
seem
to
convince
myself
that
a
real
atomic
structure
could
be
that
large
no
it
is
rather
large
for
an
atom
and
turning
to
the
two
girls
how
do
you
like
your
solitaires
they
perfectly
beautiful
and
the
tiffany
mounting
is
exquisite
replied
dorothy
enthusiastically
but
they
so
awfully
big
as
big
as
diamonds
i
do
believe
just
about
replied
seaton
but
at
that
they
the
smallest
dunark
could
find
they
have
been
kicking
around
for
years
he
says
so
small
that
nobody
wanted
them
they
wear
big
ones
on
their
bracelets
you
know
you
sure
will
make
a
hit
in
washington
dottie
people
will
think
you
wearing
a
until
they
see
it
shining
in
the
dark
then
they
think
it
an
automobile
headlight
but
after
a
few
jewelers
have
seen
these
stones
one
of
them
will
be
offering
us
five
million
dollars
apiece
for
them
trying
to
buy
them
for
some
dizzy
old
dame
who
wants
to
put
out
the
eyes
of
some
of
her
social
rivals
yes
no
that
about
right
dick
replied
crane
and
his
face
wore
a
thoughtful
look
we
ca
keep
it
secret
that
we
have
a
new
jewel
since
all
four
of
us
will
be
wearing
them
continuously
and
anyone
who
knows
jewels
at
all
will
recognize
these
as
infinitely
superior
to
any
known
earthly
jewel
in
fact
they
may
get
some
of
us
into
trouble
as
fabulously
valuable
jewels
usually
do
that
true
too
so
we
let
it
out
casually
that
they
as
common
as
mud
up
here
that
we
just
wearing
them
for
sentiment
which
is
true
and
that
we
thinking
of
bringing
back
a
shipload
to
sell
for
parking
lights
that
would
probably
keep
anyone
from
trying
to
murder
our
wives
for
their
rings
at
least
have
you
read
your
marriage
certificate
dick
asked
margaret
not
yet
let
look
at
it
dottie
she
produced
the
massive
document
and
the
auburn
head
and
the
brown
one
were
very
close
to
each
other
as
they
read
together
the
english
side
of
the
certificate
their
vows
were
there
word
for
word
with
their
own
signatures
beneath
them
all
deeply
engraved
into
the
metal
seaton
smiled
as
he
saw
the
legal
form
engraved
below
their
signatures
and
read
aloud
i
the

of

i

that
this

would

in

in

think
you
get
married
again
when
we
get
back
mart
both
girls
protested
and
crane
answered
no
i
think
not
our
ceremony
would
be
rather
an
anticlimax
after
this
one
and
this
one
will
undoubtedly
prove
legal
i
intend
to
register
this
just
as
it
is
and
get
a
ruling
from

but
it
is
time
for

pardon

i
should
have
said
for
it
certainly

my

says

this
system

is
funny
remarked
dorothy
i
just
ca
get
used
to
having
no
night
and
and
it
such
a
long
time
between
eats
as
the
famous
governor
said
about
the
drinks
broke
in
seaton
how
did
you
know
what
i
was
going
to
say
dick
husbandly
intuition
he
grinned
aided
and
abetted
by
a
normal
appetite
that
rebels
at
seventeen
hours
between
supper
and
breakfast
and
nine
hours
between
the
other
meals
well
it
time
to
eat
go
after
eating
the
men
hurried
to
the
skylark
during
the
the
vessel
had
been
banded
with
the
copper
repellers
the
machine
guns
and
instruments
including
the
wonderful
osnomian
wireless
system
had
been
installed
and
except
for
the
she
was
ready
for
a
voyage
the
kondalian
vessel
was
complete
even
to
the
cushions
but
was
without
instruments
after
a
brief
conversation
with
the
officer
in
charge
dunark
turned
to
seaton
did
you
find
that
your
springs
could
stand
up
under
the
acceleration
yes
they
flattened
out
dead
the
kolanix
felan
in
charge
of
the
work
thought
so
and
substituted
our
type
made
of
real
spring
metal
for
them
they
hold
you
through
any
acceleration
you
can
live
through
thanks
that
fine
what
next
instruments
yes
i
have
sent
a
crew
of
men
to
gather
up
what
copper
they
can
find
you
know
that
we
use
practically
no
metallic
copper
as
platinum
gold
and
silver
are
so
much
better
for
ordinary
purposes
and
another
to
erect
a
near
one
of
the
mines
which
supply
the
city
with
the
copper
sulphate
used
upon
our
tables
while
they
are
at
work
i
think
i
will
work
on
the
instruments
if
you
two
will
be
kind
enough
to
help
me
seaton
and
crane
offered
to
supply
him
with
instruments
from
their
reserve
stock
but
the
kofedix
refused
to
accept
them
saying
that
he
would
rather
have
their
help
in
making
them
so
that
he
would
thoroughly
understand
their
functions
the
electric
furnaces
were
rapidly
made
ready
and
they
set
to
work
crane
taking
great
delight
in
working
that
hitherto
rare
and
very
refractory
metal
iridium
of
which
all
the
kondalian
instruments
were
to
be
made
they
have
a
lot
of
our
rare
metals
here
dick
they
sure
have
i
like
to
set
up
a
laboratory
and
live
here
a
few
years
i
learn
something
about
my
specialty
or
burst
they
use
gold
and
silver
where
we
use
copper
and
platinum
and
its
alloys
where
we
use
iron
and
soft
steel
all
their
weapons
are
made
of
iridium
and
all
their
most
tools
such
as
their
knives
razors
and
so
on
are
made
of
opaque
arenak
i
suppose
you
noticed
the
edge
on
your
razor
how
could
i
help
it
it
is
hard
to
realize
that
a
metal
can
be
so
hard
that
it
requires
forty
years
on
a
abrasive
machine
to
hone
a
razor
or
that
once
honed
it
shaves
generation
after
generation
of
men
without
losing
in
any
degree
its
keenness
i
ca
understand
it
either
i
only
know
that
it
so
they
have
all
our
heavy
metals
in
great
abundance
and
a
lot
more
that
we
do
know
anything
about
on
earth
but
they
apparently
have
any
light
metals
at
all
it
must
be
that
osnome
was
thrown
off
the
parent
sun
late
so
that
the
light
metals
were
all
gone
something
like
that
possibly
the
extraordinary
skill
of
the
kofedix
made
the
manufacture
of
the
instruments
a
short
task
and
after
crane
had
replaced
the
few
broken
instruments
of
the
skylark
from
their
reserve
stock
they
turned
their
attention
to
the
supply
of
copper
that
had
been
gathered
they
found
it
enough
for
only
two
bars
is
this
all
we
have
asked
dunark
sharply
it
is
your
highness
replied
the
kolanix
that
is
every
scrap
of
metallic
copper
in
the
city
oh
well
that
be
enough
to
last
until
we
can
smelt
the
rest
said
seaton
with
one
bar
apiece
we
ready
for
anything
mardonale
can
start
let
come
the
bars
were
placed
in
the
containers
and
both
vessels
were
tried
out
each
making
a
perfect
performance
upon
the
following
kokam
immediately
after
the
first
meal
the
full
party
from
the
earth
boarded
the
skylark
and
accompanied
the
kofedix
to
the
copper
smelter
dunark
himself
directed
the
work
of
preparing
the
charges
and
the
molds
though
he
was
continually
being
interrupted
by
wireless
messages
in
code
and
by
messengers
bearing
tidings
too
important
to
trust
into
the
air
i
hope
you
will
excuse
all
of
these
delays
said
dunark
after
the
twentieth
interruption
but
that
all
right
dunark
we
know
that
you
a
busy
man
i
can
tell
you
about
it
but
i
would
want
to
tell
many
people
with
the
salt
you
gave
us
i
am
preparing
a
that
will
enable
us
to
blow
mardonale
into
he
broke
off
as
a
wireless
call
for
help
sounded
all
listened
intently
learning
that
a
was
being
pursued
by
a
karlon
a
few
hundred
miles
away
now
the
time
for
you
to
study
one
dunark
seaton
exclaimed
get
your
gang
of
scientists
out
here
while
we
go
get
him
and
drag
him
in
as
dunark
sent
the
message
the
skylark
people
hurried
aboard
and
seaton
drove
the
vessel
toward
the
calls
for
help
with
its
great
speed
it
reached
the
monster
before
the
plane
was
overtaken
focusing
the
attractor
upon
the
enormous
metallic
beak
of
the
karlon
seaton
threw
on
the
power
and
the
beast
halted
in
midair
as
it
was
jerked
backward
and
upward
as
it
saw
the
puny
size
of
the
attacking
skylark
it
opened
its
cavernous
mouth
in
a
horrible
roar
and
rushed
at
full
speed
seaton
unwilling
to
have
the
repellers
stripped
from
the
vessel
turned
on
the
current
actuating
them
the
karlon
was
hurled
backward
to
the
point
of
equilibrium
of
the
two
forces
where
it
struggled
demoniacally
seaton
carried
his
captive
back
to
the
smelter
where
finally
by
judicious
pushing
and
pulling
he
succeeded
in
turning
the
monster
flat
upon
its
back
and
pinning
it
to
the
ground
in
spite
of
its
struggles
to
escape
soon
the
scientists
arrived
and
studied
the
animal
thoroughly
at
as
close
a
range
as
its
flailing
arms
permitted
i
wish
we
could
kill
him
without
blowing
him
to
bits
wirelessed
dunark
do
you
know
any
way
of
doing
it
we
could
if
we
had
a
few
barrels
of
ether
or
some
of
our
own
poison
gases
but
they
are
all
unknown
here
and
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
build
the
apparatus
to
make
them
i
see
if
i
ca
tire
him
out
and
get
him
that
way
as
soon
as
you
studied
him
enough
we
may
be
able
to
find
out
where
he
lives
too
the
scientists
having
finished
their
observations
seaton
jerked
the
animal
a
few
miles
into
the
air
and
shut
off
the
forces
acting
upon
it
there
was
a
sudden
crash
and
the
karlon
knowing
that
this
apparently
insignificant
vessel
was
its
master
turned
in
headlong
flight
have
you
any
idea
what
caused
the
noise
just
then
dick
asked
crane
who
with
characteristic
imperturbability
had
taken
out
his
notebook
and
was
making
exact
notes
of
all
that
transpired
i
imagine
we
cracked
a
few
of
his
plates
replied
seaton
with
a
laugh
as
he
held
the
skylark
in
place
a
few
hundred
feet
above
the
fleeing
animal
pitted
for
the
first
time
in
its
life
against
an
antagonist
who
could
both
outfly
and
outfight
it
the
karlon
redoubled
its
efforts
and
fled
in
a
panic
of
fear
it
flew
back
over
the
city
of
kondalek
over
the
outlying
country
and
out
over
the
ocean
still
followed
easily
by
the
skylark
as
they
neared
the
mardonalian
border
a
fleet
of
warships
rose
to
contest
the
entry
of
the
monster
seaton
not
wishing
to
let
the
foe
see
the
rejuvenated
skylark
jerked
his
captive
high
into
the
thin
air
as
soon
as
it
was
released
it
headed
for
the
ocean
in
an
almost
perpendicular
dive
while
seaton
focused
an
upon
it
go
to
it
old
top
he
addressed
the
plunging
monster
we
follow
you
clear
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
if
you
go
that
far
there
was
a
mighty
double
splash
as
the
karlon
struck
the
water
closely
followed
by
the
skylark
the
girls
gasped
as
the
vessel
plunged
below
the
surface
at
such
terrific
speed
and
seemed
surprised
that
it
had
suffered
no
injury
and
that
they
had
felt
no
jar
seaton
turned
on
the
powerful
searchlights
and
kept
close
enough
so
that
he
could
see
the
monster
through
the
transparent
walls
deeper
and
deeper
the
quarry
dove
until
it
was
plainly
evident
to
the
pursuers
that
it
was
just
as
much
at
home
in
the
water
as
it
was
in
the
air
the
beams
of
the
lights
revealed
strange
forms
of
life
among
which
were
huge
fishes
which
floundered
about
blindly
in
the
unaccustomed
glare
as
the
karlon
bored
still
deeper
the
living
things
became
scarcer
but
still
occasional
fleeting
glimpses
were
obtained
of
the
living
nightmares
which
inhabited
the
oppressive
depths
of
these
strange
seas
continuing
downward
the
karlon
plumbed
the
nethermost
pit
of
the
ocean
and
came
to
rest
upon
the
bottom
stirring
up
a
murk
of
ooze
how
deep
are
we
mart
about
four
miles
i
have
read
the
pressure
but
will
have
to
calculate
later
exactly
what
depth
it
represents
from
the
gravity
and
density
readings
as
the
animal
showed
no
sign
of
leaving
its
retreat
seaton
pulled
it
out
with
the
attractor
and
it
broke
for
the
surface
rising
through
the
water
at
full
speed
it
burst
into
the
air
and
soared
upward
to
such
an
incredible
height
that
seaton
was
amazed
i
would
have
believed
that
anything
could
fly
in
air
this
thin
he
exclaimed
it
is
thin
up
here
assented
crane
less
than
three
pounds
to
the
square
inch
i
wonder
how
he
does
it
it
does
look
as
though
we
are
ever
going
to
find
out
he
sure
a
replied
seaton
as
the
karlon
unable
to
ascend
further
dropped
in
a
slanting
dive
toward
the
lowlands
of
kondal
the
terrible
swampy
region
covered
with
poisonous
vegetation
and
inhabited
by
frightful
animals
and
even
more
frightful
savages
the
monster
neared
the
ground
with
speed
seaton
keeping
close
behind
it
remarked
to
crane
he
have
to
flatten
out
pretty
quick
or
he
burst
something
sure
but
it
did
not
flatten
out
it
struck
the
soft
ground
head
foremost
and
disappeared
its
tentacles
apparently
boring
a
way
ahead
of
it
astonished
at
such
an
development
seaton
brought
the
skylark
to
a
stop
and
stabbed
into
the
ground
with
the
attractor
the
first
attempt
brought
up
nothing
but
a
pillar
of
muck
the
second
brought
to
light
a
couple
of
wings
and
one
writhing
arm
the
third
brought
the
whole
animal
still
struggling
as
strongly
as
it
had
in
the
first
contest
seaton
again
lifted
the
animal
high
into
the
air
if
he
does
that
again
we
follow
him
will
the
ship
stand
it
asked
duquesne
with
interest
yes
the
old
bus
would
have
but
this
one
can
stand
anything
we
can
go
anywhere
that
thing
can
that
a
cinch
if
we
have
enough
power
on
we
probably
wo
even
feel
a
jolt
when
we
strike
ground
seaton
reduced
the
force
acting
upon
the
animal
until
just
enough
was
left
to
keep
the
attractor
upon
it
and
it
again
dived
into
the
swamp
the
skylark
followed
feeling
its
way
in
the
total
darkness
until
the
animal
stopped
refusing
to
move
in
any
direction
at
a
depth
estimated
by
crane
to
be
about
of
a
mile
after
waiting
some
time
seaton
increased
the
power
of
the
attractor
and
tore
the
karlon
back
to
the
surface
and
into
the
air
where
it
turned
on
the
skylark
with
redoubled
fury
we
dug
him
out
of
his
last
refuge
and
he
fighting
like
a
cornered
rat
said
seaton
as
he
repelled
the
monster
to
a
safe
distance
apparently
as
fresh
as
when
he
started
in
spite
of
all
this
playing
talk
about
a
game
fish
he
does
intend
to
run
any
more
though
so
i
guess
we
have
to
put
him
away
it
a
shame
to
bump
him
off
but
got
to
be
done
crane
aimed
one
of
the
heavy
bullets
at
the
monster
and
the
earth
rocked
with
the
concussion
as
the
shell
struck
its
mark
they
hurried
back
to
the
smelter
where
dunark
asked
eagerly
what
did
you
find
out
about
it
nothing
much
replied
seaton
and
in
a
few
words
described
the
actions
of
the
karlon
what
did
your
savants
think
of
it
very
little
that
any
of
us
can
understand
in
terms
of
any
other
known
organism
it
seems
to
combine
all
the
characteristics
of
bird
beast
and
fish
and
to
have
within
itself
the
possibilities
of
both
bisexual
and
asexual
reproduction
i
would
doubt
it
it
a
queer
one
all
right
the
copper
bars
were
cool
enough
to
handle
and
the
skylark
was
loaded
with
five
times
its
original
supply
of
copper
the
other
vessel
taking
on
a
much
smaller
amount
after
the
kofedix
had
directed
the
officer
in
charge
to
place
the
remaining
bars
in
places
throughout
the
nation
the
two
vessels
were
piloted
back
to
the
palace
arriving
just
in
time
for
the
last
meal
of
the
kokam
well
dunark
said
seaton
after
the
meal
was
over
i
afraid
that
we
must
go
back
as
soon
as
we
can
dorothy
parents
and
martin
bankers
will
think
they
are
dead
by
this
time
we
should
start
right
now
but
oh
no
you
must
not
do
that
that
would
rob
our
people
of
the
chance
of
bidding
you
goodbye
there
another
reason
too
i
have
a
mighty
big
favor
to
ask
of
you
it
is
granted
if
man
can
do
it
consider
it
done
well
you
know
platinum
is
a
very
scarce
and
highly
useful
metal
with
us
i
wonder
if
you
could
let
us
have
a
few
tons
of
it
and
i
would
like
to
have
another
faidon
too
i
want
to
see
if
i
ca
analyze
it
you
have
given
us
a
thousand
times
the
value
of
all
the
platinum
and
all
the
jewels
your
vessel
can
carry
as
soon
as
the
foundries
are
open
tomorrow
we
will
go
and
load
up
your
or
if
you
wish
we
will
do
it
now
that
is
necessary
we
may
as
well
enjoy
your
hospitality
for
one
more
get
the
platinum
during
the
first
and
bid
you
goodbye
just
before
the
second
meal
how
would
that
be
perfectly
satisfactory
the
following
kokam
dunark
piloted
the
skylark
with
seaton
crane
and
duquesne
as
crew
to
one
of
the
great
platinum
foundries
the
girls
remained
behind
to
get
ready
for
their
departure
and
for
the
great
ceremony
which
was
to
precede
it
the
trip
to
the
foundry
was
a
short
one
and
the
three
scientists
of
earth
stared
at
what
they
saw
thousands
of
tons
of
platinum
cast
into
bars
and
piled
up
like
waiting
to
be
made
into
numerous
articles
of
use
throughout
the
nation
dunark
wrote
out
an
order
which
his
chief
attendant
handed
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
foundry
saying
please
have
it
loaded
at
once
seaton
indicated
the
storage
compartment
into
which
the
metal
was
to
be
carried
and
a
procession
of
slaves
two
men
staggering
under
one
ingot
was
soon
formed
between
the
pile
and
the
storage
room
how
much
are
you
loading
on
dunark
asked
seaton
when
the
large
compartment
was
more
than
half
full
my
order
called
for
about
twenty
tons
in
your
weight
but
i
changed
it
later
we
may
as
well
fill
that
room
full
so
that
the
metal
will
not
rattle
around
in
flight
it
does
make
any
difference
to
us
we
have
so
much
of
it
it
is
like
your
gift
of
the
salt
only
vastly
smaller
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
all
dick
asked
crane
that
is
enough
to
break
the
platinum
market
completely
that
exactly
what
i
going
to
do
returned
seaton
with
a
gleam
in
his
gray
eyes
i
going
to
burst
this
unjustifiable
fad
for
platinum
jewelry
so
wide
open
that
it
never
recover
and
make
platinum
again
available
for
its
proper
uses
in
laboratories
and
in
the
industries
you
know
yourself
he
rushed
on
hotly
that
the
only
reason
platinum
is
used
at
all
for
jewelry
is
that
it
is
expensive
it
is
nearly
so
handsome
as
either
gold
or
silver
and
if
it
was
the
most
costly
common
metal
we
have
the
crowd
would
touch
it
with
a
pole
useless
as
an
ornament
it
is
the
one
absolutely
indispensable
laboratory
metal
and
literally
hundreds
of
laboratories
that
need
it
ca
have
it
because
over
half
the
world
supply
is
tied
up
in
jeweler
windows
and
in
useless
baubles
then
too
it
is
the
best
thing
known
for
contact
points
in
electrical
machinery
when
the
government
and
all
the
scientific
societies
were
abjectly
begging
the
jewelers
to
let
loose
a
little
of
it
they
refused
they
were
selling
it
to
profiteering
spendthrifts
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
an
ounce
the
condition
is
much
better
right
now
it
a
vicious
circle
as
long
as
the
price
stays
high
it
will
be
used
for
jewelry
and
as
long
as
it
is
used
for
jewelry
the
price
will
stay
high
and
scientists
will
have
to
fight
the
jewelers
for
what
little
they
get
while
somewhat
exaggerated
that
is
about
the
way
matters
stand
i
will
admit
that
i
too
am
rather
bitter
on
the
subject
said
crane
bitter
of
course
you
bitter
everybody
is
who
knows
anything
about
science
and
who
has
a
brain
in
his
head
anybody
who
claims
to
be
a
scientist
and
yet
stands
for
any
of
his
folks
buying
platinum
jewelry
ought
to
be
shot
but
they
get
theirs
as
soon
as
we
get
back
they
would
let
go
of
it
before
they
had
too
good
a
thing
but
they
let
go
now
and
get
their
fingers
burned
besides
i
going
to
dump
this
whole
shipment
at
fifty
cents
a
pound
and
we
take
mighty
good
care
that
jewelers
do
corner
the
supply
i
with
you
dick
as
usual
soon
the
storage
room
was
filled
to
the
ceiling
with
ingots
of
the
precious
metal
and
the
skylark
was
driven
back
to
the
landing
dock
she
alighted
beside
dunark
vessel
the
whose
crew
of
high
officers
sprang
to
attention
as
the
four
men
stepped
out
all
were
dressed
for
the
ceremonial
the
three
americans
wearing
their
spotless
white
the
kondalians
wearing
their
most
resplendent
trappings
this
formal
stuff
sure
does
pull
my
cork
exclaimed
seaton
to
dunark
i
want
to
get
this
straight
the
arrangement
was
that
we
were
to
be
here
at
this
time
all
dressed
up
and
wait
for
the
ladies
who
are
coming
under
the
escort
of
your
people
yes
our
family
is
to
escort
the
ladies
from
the
palace
here
as
they
leave
the
elevator
the
surrounding
will
salute
and
after
a
brief
ceremony
you
two
will
escort
your
wives
into
the
skylark
doctor
duquesne
standing
a
little
apart
and
following
you
in
the
will
escort
you
as
high
as
they
can
go
and
the
kondal
will
accompany
you
as
far
as
our
most
distant
sun
before
turning
back
for
a
few
moments
seaton
nervously
paced
a
short
beat
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
i
getting
more
fussed
every
second
he
said
abruptly
taking
out
his
wireless
instrument
i
going
to
see
if
they
are
about
ready
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
dick
have
you
another
hunch
or
are
you
just
rattled
asked
crane
rattled
i
guess
but
i
sure
do
want
to
get
going
he
replied
as
he
worked
the
lever
rapidly
dottie
he
sent
out
and
the
call
being
answered
how
long
will
you
be
we
all
ready
and
waiting
chewing
our
with
impatience
we
soon
be
ready
the
karfedix
is
coming
for
us
now
scarcely
had
the
tiny
sounder
become
silent
when
the
air
was
shaken
by
an
message
and
every
wireless
sounder
gave
warning
chapter
xviii
the
invasion
the
pulsating
air
and
the
chattering
sounders
were
giving
the
same
dire
warning
the
alarm
extraordinary
of
invasion
of
imminent
and
catastrophic
danger
from
the
air
do
try
to
reach
the
palace
everyone
on
the
ground
will
have
time
enough
to
hide
in
the
deep
pits
beneath
the
buildings
and
you
would
be
killed
by
the
invaders
long
before
you
could
reach
the
palace
if
we
can
repel
the
enemy
and
keep
them
from
landing
the
women
will
be
perfectly
safe
even
though
the
whole
city
is
destroyed
if
they
effect
a
landing
we
are
lost
they
not
land
then
seaton
answered
grimly
as
he
sprang
into
the
skylark
and
took
his
place
at
the
board
as
crane
took
out
his
wireless
seaton
cautioned
him
send
in
english
and
tell
the
girls
not
to
answer
as
these
devils
can
locate
the
calls
within
a
foot
and
will
be
able
to
attack
the
right
spot
just
tell
them
we
safe
in
the
skylark
tell
them
to
sit
tight
while
we
wipe
out
this
gang
that
is
coming
and
that
we
call
them
once
in
a
while
when
we
have
time
during
the
battle
before
crane
had
finished
sending
the
message
the
crescendo
whine
of
enormous
propellers
was
heard
simultaneously
there
was
a
deafening
concussion
and
one
entire
wing
of
the
palace
disappeared
in
a
cloud
of
dust
in
the
midst
of
which
could
be
discerned
a
few
flying
fragments
the
air
was
filled
with
mardonalian
warships
they
were
huge
vessels
each
mounting
hundreds
of
guns
and
the
rain
of
shells
was
rapidly
reducing
the
great
city
to
a
heap
of
debris
seaton
hand
was
upon
the
lever
which
would
hurl
the
skylark
upward
into
the
fray
crane
and
duquesne
each
hard
of
eye
and
grim
of
jaw
were
stationed
at
their
something
up
exclaimed
seaton
look
at
the
kondal
something
had
happened
indeed
dunark
sat
at
the
board
his
hand
upon
the
power
lever
and
each
of
his
crew
was
in
place
grasping
his
weapon
but
every
man
was
writhing
in
agony
unable
to
control
his
movements
as
they
stared
momentarily
spellbound
the
entire
crew
ceased
their
agonized
struggles
and
hung
apparently
lifeless
from
their
supports
they
got
to
some
way
let
go
yelled
seaton
as
his
hand
tightened
upon
the
lever
a
succession
of
shells
burst
upon
the
dock
wrecking
it
completely
all
three
men
fancied
that
the
world
had
come
to
an
end
as
the
stream
of
high
explosive
was
directed
against
their
vessel
but
the
shell
of
arenak
was
impregnable
and
seaton
shot
the
skylark
upward
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
fleet
the
two
gunners
fired
as
fast
as
they
could
sight
their
weapons
and
with
each
shot
one
of
the
great
warships
was
blown
into
fragments
the
mardonalians
then
concentrated
the
fire
of
their
entire
fleet
upon
their
tiny
opponent
from
every
point
of
the
compass
from
above
and
below
the
enemy
gunners
directed
streams
of
shells
against
the
dodging
vessel
the
noise
was
more
than
deafening
it
was
one
continuous
shattering
explosion
and
the
were
surrounded
by
such
a
blaze
of
fire
from
the
exploding
shells
that
they
could
not
see
the
enemy
vessels
seaton
sought
to
dodge
the
shells
by
a
long
dive
toward
one
side
only
to
find
that
dozens
of
new
opponents
had
been
launched
against
them
the
deadly
of
osnome
steered
by
wireless
and
carrying
no
crews
they
were
simply
winged
bombs
carrying
thousands
of
pounds
of
terrific
electrical
explosive
enough
to
kill
the
men
inside
the
vessel
by
the
concussion
of
the
explosion
even
should
the
arenak
armor
be
strong
enough
to
withstand
the
blow
though
much
faster
than
the
osnomian
vessels
they
were
slow
beside
the
skylark
and
seaton
could
have
dodged
a
few
of
them
with
ease
as
he
dodged
however
they
followed
relentlessly
and
in
spite
of
those
which
were
blown
up
by
the
gunners
their
number
constantly
increased
until
seaton
thought
of
the
repellers
holme
is
right
he
exclaimed
as
he
threw
on
the
power
actuating
the
copper
bands
which
encircled
the
hull
in
all
directions
instantly
the
torpedoes
were
hurled
backward
exploding
as
the
force
struck
them
and
even
the
shells
were
ineffective
exploding
harmlessly
as
they
encountered
the
zone
of
force
the
noise
of
the
awful
detonations
lessened
markedly
why
the
silence
i
wonder
asked
seaton
while
the
futile
shells
of
the
enemy
continued
to
waste
their
force
some
hundreds
of
feet
distant
from
their
goal
and
while
crane
and
duquesne
were
methodically
destroying
the
huge
vessels
as
fast
as
they
could
aim
and
fire
at
every
report
one
of
the
monster
warships
disappeared
its
shattered
fragments
and
the
bodies
of
its
crew
hurtling
to
the
ground
his
voice
could
not
be
heard
in
even
the
lessened
tumult
but
he
continued
it
must
be
that
our
repellers
have
set
up
a
partial
vacuum
by
repelling
even
the
air
suddenly
the
shelling
ceased
and
the
skylark
was
enveloped
by
a
blinding
glare
from
hundreds
of
great
reflectors
an
intense
searching
light
that
burned
the
flesh
and
seared
through
eyelids
and
eyeballs
into
the
very
brain
yelled
seaton
at
the
first
glimpse
of
the
light
as
he
threw
on
the
power
shut
your
eyes
turn
your
heads
down
out
in
space
far
beyond
reach
of
the
deadly
rays
the
men
held
a
short
conference
then
donned
heavy
suits
which
they
smeared
liberally
with
thick
red
paint
and
replaced
the
plain
glasses
of
their
helmets
with
heavy
lenses
of
deep
ruby
glass
this
stop
any
ray
ever
produced
exulted
seaton
as
he
again
threw
the
vessel
into
the
mardonalian
fleet
a
score
of
the
great
vessels
met
their
fate
before
the
skylark
was
located
and
although
the
terrible
rays
were
again
focused
upon
the
intruder
in
all
their
intensity
the
carnage
continued
in
a
few
minutes
however
the
men
heard
or
rather
felt
a
low
intense
vibration
like
a
silent
wave
of
sound
a
vibration
which
smote
upon
the
eardrums
as
no
possible
sound
could
smite
a
vibration
which
racked
the
joints
and
tortured
the
nerves
as
though
the
whole
body
were
disintegrating
so
sudden
and
terrible
was
the
effect
that
seaton
uttered
an
involuntary
yelp
of
surprise
and
pain
as
he
once
more
fled
into
the
safety
of
space
what
the
devil
was
that
demanded
duquesne
was
it
i
did
suppose
such
waves
could
be
produced
is
right
they
produce
most
anything
here
replied
seaton
and
crane
added
well
about
three
fur
suits
apiece
with
cotton
in
our
ears
ought
to
kill
any
wave
propagated
through
air
the
fur
suits
were
donned
forthwith
seaton
whispering
in
crane
ear
i
found
out
something
else
too
the
repellers
repel
even
the
air
i
going
to
shoot
enough
juice
through
them
to
set
up
a
perfect
vacuum
outside
that
kill
those
scarcely
were
they
back
within
range
of
the
fleet
when
duquesne
reaching
for
his
gun
to
fire
the
first
shot
leaped
backward
with
a
yell
beat
it
once
more
at
a
safe
distance
duquesne
explained
it
lucky
i
so
used
to
handling
hot
stuff
that
from
force
of
habit
i
never
make
close
contact
with
anything
at
the
first
touch
that
gun
carried
thousands
of
volts
with
lots
of
amperage
behind
them
and
if
i
had
had
a
good
hold
on
it
i
could
have
let
go
we
block
that
game
quick
enough
though
thick
dry
gloves
covered
with
rubber
are
all
that
is
necessary
it
a
good
thing
for
all
of
us
that
you
have
those
fancy
condensite
handles
on
your
levers
seaton
that
was
how
they
got
dunark
undoubtedly
said
crane
as
he
sent
a
brief
message
to
the
girls
assuring
them
that
all
was
well
as
he
had
been
doing
at
every
respite
but
why
were
we
not
overcome
at
the
same
time
they
must
have
had
the
current
tuned
to
iridium
and
had
to
experiment
until
they
found
the
right
wave
for
steel
seaton
explained
i
should
think
our
bar
would
have
exploded
with
all
that
current
they
must
have
hit
the
copper
range
too
seaton
frowned
in
thought
before
he
answered
maybe
because
it
induced
current
and
not
a
steady
battery
impulse
anyway
it
did
let
go
just
a
minute
put
in
crane
what
are
they
going
to
do
next
dick
search
me
i
not
used
to
my
new
osnomian
mind
yet
i
recognize
things
all
right
after
they
happen
but
i
ca
seem
to
figure
ahead
it
like
a
something
that
flashes
up
as
soon
as
mentioned
i
get
too
many
and
too
new
ideas
at
once
i
know
though
that
the
osnomians
have
defenses
against
all
these
things
except
this
last
stunt
of
the
charged
guns
that
must
be
the
new
one
that
mardonale
stole
from
kondal
the
defenses
are
however
purely
osnomian
in
character
and
material
as
we
have
got
the
stuff
to
set
them
up
as
the
osnomians
do
we
have
to
do
it
our
own
way
we
may
be
able
to
dope
out
the
next
one
though
let
see
what
have
they
given
us
so
far
we
got
to
hand
it
to
them
responded
duquesne
admiringly
giving
us
the
whole
range
of
one
at
a
time
they
given
us
light
both
and
visible
sound
and
electricity
i
do
know
what
left
unless
they
give
us
a
new
kind
of
or
hertzian
or
heat
waves
or
that
it
heat
exclaimed
seaton
they
produce
heat
by
means
of
powerful
and
by
setting
up
heavy
induced
currents
in
the
armor
they
can
melt
arenak
that
way
do
you
suppose
we
can
handle
the
heat
with
our
refrigerators
asked
crane
probably
we
have
a
lot
of
power
and
the
new
arenak
cylinders
of
our
compressors
will
stand
anything
the
only
trouble
will
be
in
cooling
the
condensers
we
run
as
long
as
we
have
any
water
in
our
tanks
then
go
dive
into
the
ocean
to
cool
off
we
try
it
a
whirl
anyway
soon
the
skylark
was
again
dealing
out
death
and
destruction
in
the
thick
of
the
enemy
vessels
who
again
turned
from
the
devastation
of
the
helpless
city
to
destroy
this
troublesome
antagonist
but
in
spite
of
the
utmost
efforts
of
and
electricity
the
continued
to
take
its
terrible
toll
as
seaton
had
foretold
the
armor
of
the
skylark
began
to
grow
hot
and
he
turned
on
the
full
power
of
the
refrigerating
system
in
spite
of
the
cooling
apparatus
however
the
outer
walls
finally
began
to
glow
redly
and
although
the
interior
was
comfortably
cool
the
ends
of
the
which
were
set
flush
with
the
surface
of
the
revolving
arenak
globes
which
held
them
softened
rendering
the
guns
useless
the
copper
repellers
melted
and
dripped
off
in
flaming
balls
of
molten
metal
so
that
shells
once
more
began
to
crash
against
the
armor
duquesne
with
no
thought
of
quitting
apparent
in
voice
or
manner
said
calmly
well
it
looks
as
though
they
had
us
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
go
back
into
space
and
dope
out
something
else
seaton
thinking
intensely
saw
a
vast
fleet
of
enemy
reinforcements
approaching
and
at
the
same
time
received
a
wireless
call
directed
to
dunark
it
was
from
the
grand
fleet
of
kondal
hastening
from
the
bordering
ocean
to
the
defense
of
the
city
using
dunark
private
code
seaton
told
the
karbix
who
was
in
charge
of
the
fleet
that
the
enemy
had
a
new
invention
which
would
wipe
them
out
utterly
without
a
chance
to
fight
and
that
he
and
his
vessel
were
in
control
of
the
situation
and
ordered
him
to
see
that
no
kondalian
ship
came
within
battle
range
of
a
mardonalian
he
then
turned
to
crane
and
duquesne
his
face
grim
and
his
fighting
jaw
set
i
got
it
doped
right
now
give
the
lark
speed
enough
and
she
some
bullet
herself
we
got
four
feet
of
arenak
they
got
only
an
inch
and
arenak
does
even
begin
to
soften
until
far
above
a
blinding
white
temperature
strap
yourselves
in
solid
for
it
going
to
be
a
rough
party
from
now
on
they
buckled
their
belts
firmly
and
seaton
holding
the
bar
toward
their
nearest
antagonist
applied
twenty
notches
of
power
the
skylark
darted
forward
and
crashed
completely
through
the
great
airship
torn
wide
open
by
the
projectile
its
engines
wrecked
and
its
and
propellers
completely
disabled
the
helpless
hulk
plunged
through
two
miles
of
empty
air
a
mass
of
wreckage
illustration
the
skylark
darted
forward
and
crashed
completely
through
the
great
airship
she
was
an
embodied
thunderbolt
a
huge
irresistible
indestructible
projectile
directed
by
a
keen
brain
inside
darting
hither
and
thither
the
tore
through
vessel
after
vessel
of
the
mardonalian
fleet
she
was
an
embodied
thunderbolt
a
huge
irresistible
indestructible
projectile
directed
by
a
keen
brain
inside
it
the
brain
of
richard
seaton
roused
to
his
highest
fighting
pitch
and
fighting
for
everything
that
man
holds
dear
tortured
by
the
terrible
silent
waves
which
now
that
the
protecting
vacuum
had
been
destroyed
were
only
partially
stopped
by
the
fur
suits
shaken
and
battered
by
the
terrific
impacts
and
the
even
greater
shocks
occurring
every
second
as
the
direction
of
the
vessel
was
changed
made
sick
and
dizzy
by
the
nauseating
swings
and
lurches
as
the
skylark
spun
about
the
central
chamber
seaton
wonderful
physique
and
his
nerves
of
steel
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
this
the
supreme
battle
of
his
life
as
with
teeth
and
eyes
gray
and
hard
as
the
fracture
of
steel
he
urged
the
skylark
on
to
greater
and
greater
efforts
though
it
was
impossible
for
the
eye
to
follow
the
flight
of
the
the
mechanical
sighting
devices
of
the
mardonalian
vessels
kept
her
in
as
perfect
focus
as
though
she
were
stationary
and
the
great
generators
continued
to
hurl
into
her
the
full
power
of
their
waves
the
enemy
guns
were
still
spitting
forth
their
streams
of
shells
but
unlike
the
waves
the
shells
moved
so
slowly
compared
to
their
target
that
only
a
few
found
their
mark
and
many
of
the
vessels
fell
to
the
ground
riddled
by
the
shells
of
their
with
anxious
eyes
seaton
watched
the
hull
of
his
animated
change
in
color
from
dull
red
it
became
cherry
and
as
the
cherry
red
gave
place
to
bright
red
heat
seaton
threw
even
more
power
into
the
bar
as
he
muttered
through
his
set
teeth
well
seaton
old
top
you
got
to
cut
out
this
loafing
on
the
job
and
get
busy
in
spite
of
his
utmost
exertions
and
in
spite
of
the
powerful
ammonia
plant
now
exerting
its
full
capacity
but
sadly
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
its
was
now
boiling
seaton
saw
the
arenak
shell
continue
to
heat
the
bright
red
was
succeeded
by
orange
which
slowly
changed
first
to
yellow
then
to
light
yellow
and
finally
to
a
dazzling
white
through
which
with
the
aid
of
his
heavy
red
lenses
he
could
still
see
the
enemy
ships
after
a
time
he
noted
that
the
color
had
gone
down
to
yellow
and
he
thrilled
with
exultation
knowing
that
he
had
so
reduced
the
numbers
of
the
enemy
fleet
that
their
could
no
longer
overcome
his
refrigerators
after
a
few
minutes
more
of
the
awful
carnage
there
remained
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
proud
fleet
which
thousands
strong
had
invaded
kondal
a
remnant
that
sought
safety
in
flight
but
even
in
flight
they
still
fought
with
all
their
weapons
and
the
streams
of
bombs
dropped
from
their
upon
the
country
beneath
marked
the
path
of
their
retreat
with
a
wide
swath
of
destruction
half
inclined
to
let
the
few
remaining
vessels
escape
seaton
mind
changed
instantly
as
he
saw
the
bombs
spreading
devastation
upon
the
countryside
and
not
until
the
last
of
the
mardonalian
vessels
had
been
destroyed
did
he
drop
the
skylark
into
the
area
of
ruins
which
had
once
been
the
palace
grounds
beside
the
kondal
which
was
still
lying
as
it
had
fallen
after
several
attempts
to
steady
their
whirling
senses
the
three
men
finally
were
able
to
walk
and
opening
a
door
they
leaped
out
through
the
opening
in
the
still
glowing
wall
seaton
first
act
was
to
wireless
the
news
to
dorothy
who
replied
that
they
were
coming
as
fast
as
they
could
the
men
then
removed
their
helmets
revealing
faces
pale
and
drawn
and
turned
to
the
helpless
there
no
way
of
getting
into
this
thing
from
the
outside
seaton
began
when
he
saw
that
the
kofedix
and
his
party
were
beginning
to
revive
soon
dunark
opened
the
door
and
stumbled
out
i
have
to
thank
you
for
more
than
my
life
this
time
he
said
his
voice
shaken
by
uncontrollable
emotion
as
he
grasped
the
hands
of
all
three
men
though
unable
to
move
i
was
conscious
and
saw
all
that
happened
you
kept
them
so
busy
that
they
did
have
a
chance
to
give
us
enough
to
kill
us
outright
you
have
saved
the
lives
of
millions
of
our
nation
and
have
saved
kondal
itself
from
annihilation
oh
it
not
that
bad
answered
seaton
uncomfortably
both
nations
have
been
invaded
before
yes
once
when
we
developed
the
ray
once
when
mardonale
perfected
the
machine
for
producing
the
silent
and
again
when
we
harnessed
the
but
this
would
have
been
the
most
complete
disaster
in
history
the
other
inventions
were
not
so
deadly
as
was
this
one
and
there
were
terrible
battles
from
which
the
victors
emerged
so
crippled
that
they
could
not
completely
exterminate
the
vanquished
who
were
able
to
themselves
in
the
course
of
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
this
would
have
been
the
end
as
not
a
kondalian
soldier
could
move
any
person
touching
iridium
was
helpless
and
would
have
been
killed
he
ceased
speaking
and
saluted
as
the
karfedix
and
his
party
rounded
a
heap
of
boulders
dorothy
and
margaret
screamed
in
unison
as
they
saw
the
haggard
faces
of
their
husbands
and
saw
their
suits
dripping
with
a
thick
substance
which
they
knew
to
be
red
in
spite
of
its
color
seaton
dodged
nimbly
as
dorothy
sought
to
take
him
in
her
arms
and
tore
off
his
suit
nothing
but
red
paint
to
stop
their
he
reassured
her
as
he
lifted
her
clear
from
the
ground
in
a
embrace
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
the
kondalians
staring
in
amazement
at
the
skylark
wheeling
swiftly
he
laughed
as
he
saw
a
gigantic
ball
of
frost
and
snow
again
donning
his
fur
suit
he
shut
off
the
refrigerators
and
returned
to
his
party
where
the
karfedix
gave
him
thanks
in
measured
terms
as
he
fell
silent
dunark
added
thanks
to
you
the
mardonalian
forces
instead
of
wiping
us
out
are
themselves
destroyed
while
only
a
handful
of
our
vessels
have
been
lost
since
the
grand
fleet
could
not
arrive
until
the
battle
was
over
and
since
the
vessels
that
would
have
thrown
themselves
away
were
saved
by
your
orders
which
i
heard
thanks
to
you
we
are
not
even
crippled
though
our
capital
is
destroyed
and
the
lives
of
some
unfortunates
who
could
not
reach
the
pits
in
time
have
probably
been
lost
thanks
to
you
he
continued
in
a
ringing
voice
and
to
the
salt
and
the
new
source
of
power
you
have
given
us
mardonale
shall
now
be
destroyed
utterly
after
sending
out
ships
to
relieve
the
suffering
of
the
few
wounded
and
the
many
homeless
dunark
summoned
a
corps
of
mechanics
who
banded
on
new
repellers
and
repaired
the
fused
barrels
of
the
all
that
was
necessary
to
restore
the
skylark
to
perfect
condition
facing
the
party
from
earth
the
karfedix
stood
in
the
ruins
of
his
magnificent
palace
back
of
him
were
the
nobles
of
kondal
and
still
further
back
in
order
of
rank
stood
a
multitude
of
people
is
it
permitted
oh
noble
karfedo
that
i
reward
your
captive
for
his
share
in
the
victory
he
asked
it
is
acquiesced
seaton
and
crane
and
roban
stepped
up
to
duquesne
and
placed
in
his
hand
a
weighty
leather
bag
he
then
fastened
about
his
left
wrist
the
order
of
kondal
the
highest
order
of
the
nation
he
then
clasped
about
crane
wrist
a
disk
wrought
of
a
deep
metal
supported
by
a
heavy
bracelet
of
the
same
material
the
most
precious
metal
of
osnome
at
sight
of
the
disk
the
nobles
saluted
and
seaton
barely
concealed
a
start
of
surprise
for
it
bore
the
royal
emblem
and
delegated
to
its
bearer
power
second
only
to
that
of
the
karfedix
himself
i
bestow
upon
you
this
symbol
karfedix
crane
in
recognition
of
what
you
have
this
day
done
for
kondal
wherever
you
may
be
upon
kondalian
osnome
which
from
this
day
henceforth
shall
be
all
osnome
you
have
power
as
my
personal
representative
as
my
eldest
son
he
drew
forth
a
second
bracelet
similar
to
the
first
except
that
it
bore
seven
disks
each
differently
designed
which
he
snapped
upon
seaton
wrist
as
the
nobles
knelt
and
the
people
back
of
them
threw
themselves
upon
their
faces
no
language
spoken
by
man
possesses
words
sufficiently
weighty
to
express
our
indebtedness
to
you
karfedix
seaton
our
guest
and
our
savior
the
first
cause
has
willed
that
you
should
be
the
instrument
through
which
kondal
is
this
day
made
supreme
upon
osnome
in
small
and
partial
recognition
of
that
instrumentality
i
bestow
upon
you
these
symbols
which
proclaim
you
our
overlord
the
ultimate
authority
of
osnome
while
this
is
not
the
way
in
which
i
had
thought
to
bid
you
farewell
the
obligations
which
you
have
heaped
upon
us
render
all
smaller
things
insignificant
when
you
return
as
i
hope
and
trust
you
soon
will
the
city
shall
be
built
anew
and
we
can
welcome
you
as
befits
your
station
lifting
both
arms
above
his
head
he
continued
may
the
great
first
cause
smile
upon
you
in
all
your
endeavors
until
you
solve
the
mystery
may
your
descendants
soon
reach
the
ultimate
goal
goodbye
seaton
uttered
a
few
heartfelt
words
in
response
and
the
party
stepped
backward
toward
the
skylark
as
they
reached
the
vessel
the
standing
karfedix
and
the
ranks
of
kneeling
nobles
snapped
into
the
double
salute
truly
a
rare
demonstration
in
kondal
what
we
do
now
whispered
seaton
bow
of
course
answered
dorothy
they
bowed
deeply
and
slowly
and
entered
their
vessel
as
the
skylark
shot
into
the
air
with
the
greatest
acceleration
that
would
permit
its
passengers
to
move
about
the
grand
fleet
of
kondalian
warship
fired
a
deafening
salute
it
had
been
planned
before
the
start
that
each
person
was
to
work
sixteen
hours
out
of
the
seaton
was
to
drive
the
vessel
during
the
first
two
periods
of
each
day
crane
was
to
observe
the
stars
during
the
second
and
to
drive
during
the
third
duquesne
was
to
act
as
observer
during
the
first
and
third
periods
margaret
had
volunteered
to
assist
the
observer
in
taking
his
notes
during
her
waking
hours
and
dorothy
appointed
herself
cook
and
household
manager
as
soon
as
the
skylark
had
left
osnome
crane
told
duquesne
that
he
and
his
wife
would
work
in
the
observation
room
until
four
in
the
afternoon
at
which
time
the
prearranged
system
of
relief
would
begin
and
duquesne
retired
to
his
room
crane
and
margaret
made
their
way
to
the
darkened
room
which
housed
the
instruments
and
seated
themselves
watching
intently
and
making
no
effort
to
conceal
their
emotion
as
first
the
persons
beneath
them
then
the
giant
and
finally
the
ruined
city
itself
were
lost
to
view
osnome
slowly
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
large
moon
grew
smaller
and
as
it
disappeared
crane
began
to
take
notes
for
a
few
hours
the
seventeen
suns
of
this
strange
solar
system
shone
upon
the
flying
after
which
they
assumed
the
aspect
of
a
cluster
of
enormous
stars
slowly
growing
smaller
and
smaller
and
shrinking
closer
and
closer
together
at
four
in
the
afternoon
washington
time
duquesne
relieved
crane
who
made
his
way
to
the
engine
room
it
is
time
to
change
shifts
dick
you
have
not
had
your
sixteen
hours
but
everything
will
be
regular
from
now
on
you
two
had
better
get
some
rest
all
right
replied
seaton
as
he
relinquished
the
controls
to
crane
and
after
bidding
the
new
helmsman
goodnight
he
and
dorothy
went
below
to
their
cabin
standing
at
a
window
with
their
arms
around
each
other
they
stared
down
with
misty
eyes
at
the
very
faint
green
star
which
was
rapidly
decreasing
in
brilliance
as
the
skylark
increased
its
already
inconceivable
velocity
finally
as
it
disappeared
altogether
seaton
turned
to
his
wife
and
tenderly
lovingly
took
her
in
his
arms
littlest
girl
sweetheart
he
whispered
and
paused
overcome
by
the
intensity
of
his
feelings
i
know
husband
mine
she
answered
while
tears
dimmed
her
glorious
eyes
it
is
too
deep
with
nothing
but
words
we
ca
say
a
single
thing
chapter
xix
the
return
to
earth
duquesne
first
act
upon
gaining
the
privacy
of
his
own
cabin
was
to
open
the
leather
bag
presented
to
him
by
the
karfedix
he
expected
to
find
it
filled
with
rare
metals
with
perhaps
some
jewels
instead
of
which
the
only
metal
present
was
a
tube
containing
a
full
pound
of
metallic
radium
the
least
valuable
items
in
the
bag
were
scores
of
diamonds
rubies
and
emeralds
of
enormous
size
and
of
flawless
perfection
merely
ornamental
glass
upon
osnome
dunark
knew
that
they
were
priceless
upon
earth
and
had
acted
accordingly
to
this
great
wealth
of
known
gems
he
had
added
a
rich
and
varied
assortment
of
the
rare
and
strange
jewels
peculiar
to
his
own
world
the
faidon
alone
being
omitted
from
the
collection
duquesne
habitual
calmness
of
mind
almost
deserted
him
as
he
classified
the
contents
of
the
bag
the
radium
alone
was
worth
millions
of
dollars
and
the
scientist
in
him
exulted
that
at
last
his
brother
scientists
should
have
ample
supplies
of
that
priceless
metal
with
which
to
work
even
while
he
was
rejoicing
in
the
price
he
would
exact
for
it
he
took
out
the
familiar
jewels
estimating
their
value
as
he
counted
them
a
staggering
total
the
bag
was
still
half
full
of
the
strange
gems
some
of
them
glowing
like
miniature
lamps
in
the
dark
depths
and
he
made
no
effort
to
appraise
them
he
knew
that
once
any
competent
jeweler
had
compared
their
cold
hard
scintillating
beauty
with
that
of
any
earthly
gems
he
could
demand
his
own
price
at
last
he
breathed
to
himself
i
will
be
what
i
have
always
longed
to
be
a
money
power
now
i
can
cut
loose
from
that
gang
of
crooks
and
go
my
own
way
he
replaced
the
gems
and
the
tube
of
radium
in
the
bag
which
he
stowed
away
in
one
of
his
capacious
pockets
and
made
his
way
to
the
galley
the
return
voyage
through
space
was
uneventful
the
skylark
constantly
maintaining
the
same
velocity
with
which
she
had
started
out
several
times
as
the
days
wore
on
she
came
within
the
zone
of
attraction
of
various
gigantic
suns
but
the
pilot
had
learned
his
lesson
he
kept
a
vigilant
eye
upon
the
bar
and
at
the
first
sign
of
a
deviation
from
the
perpendicular
he
steered
away
far
from
the
source
of
the
attraction
not
content
with
these
precautions
the
man
at
the
board
would
from
time
to
time
shut
off
the
power
to
make
sure
that
the
was
not
falling
toward
a
body
directly
in
its
line
of
flight
when
half
the
distance
had
been
covered
the
bar
was
reversed
the
travelers
holding
an
impromptu
ceremony
as
the
great
vessel
spun
around
its
center
through
an
angle
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
a
few
days
later
the
observers
began
to
recognize
some
of
the
fixed
stars
in
familiar
constellations
and
knew
that
the
star
directly
in
their
line
of
flight
was
the
sun
of
their
own
solar
system
after
a
time
they
saw
that
their
course
instead
of
being
directly
toward
that
star
was
bearing
upon
a
barely
visible
star
a
little
to
one
side
of
it
pointing
their
most
powerful
telescope
toward
that
point
of
light
crane
made
out
a
planet
half
of
its
disk
shining
brightly
the
girls
hastened
to
peer
through
the
telescope
and
they
grew
excited
as
they
made
out
the
familiar
outlines
of
the
continents
and
oceans
upon
the
lighted
portion
of
the
disk
it
was
not
long
until
these
outlines
were
plainly
visible
to
the
unaided
vision
the
earth
appeared
as
a
great
softly
shining
greenish
with
parts
of
its
surface
obscured
by
fleecy
wisps
of
cloud
and
with
its
two
gleaming
making
of
its
poles
two
brilliant
areas
of
white
the
returning
wanderers
stared
at
their
own
world
with
their
hearts
in
their
throats
as
crane
who
was
at
the
board
increased
the
retarding
force
sufficiently
to
assure
himself
that
they
would
not
be
traveling
too
fast
to
land
upon
the
earth
after
dorothy
and
margaret
had
gone
to
prepare
a
meal
duquesne
turned
to
seaton
have
you
gentlemen
decided
what
you
intend
to
do
with
me
no
we
have
discussed
it
yet
i
ca
make
up
my
own
mind
what
i
want
to
do
to
you
except
that
i
sure
would
like
to
get
you
inside
a
square
ring
with
gloves
on
you
have
been
of
too
much
real
assistance
on
this
trip
for
us
to
see
you
hanged
as
you
deserve
on
the
other
hand
you
are
altogether
too
much
of
a
scoundrel
for
us
to
let
you
go
free
you
see
the
fix
we
are
in
what
would
you
suggest
nothing
replied
duquesne
calmly
as
i
am
in
no
danger
whatever
of
hanging
nothing
you
can
say
on
that
score
affects
me
in
the
least
as
for
freeing
me
you
may
do
as
you
please
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
one
way
or
the
other
as
no
jail
can
hold
me
for
a
day
i
can
say
however
that
while
i
have
made
a
fortune
on
this
trip
so
that
i
do
not
have
to
associate
further
with
steel
unless
it
is
to
my
interest
to
do
so
i
may
nevertheless
find
it
desirable
at
some
future
time
to
establish
a
monopoly
of
x
that
would
of
course
necessitate
the
death
of
yourself
and
crane
in
that
event
or
in
case
any
other
difference
should
arise
between
us
this
whole
affair
will
be
as
though
it
had
never
existed
it
will
have
no
weight
either
way
whether
or
not
you
try
to
hang
me
go
as
far
as
you
like
seaton
answered
cheerfully
if
we
not
a
match
for
you
and
your
gang
on
foot
or
in
the
air
in
body
or
in
mind
we
deserve
whatever
we
get
we
can
outrun
you
outjump
you
throw
you
down
or
lick
you
we
can
run

his
brow
darkened
in
anger
as
a
thought
struck
him
and
the
steady
gray
eyes
bored
into
the
unflinching
black
ones
as
he
continued
with
no
trace
of
his
former
levity
in
his
voice
but
listen
to
this
anything
goes
as
far
as
martin
and
i
personally
are
concerned
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
could
be
arrested
for
what
i
think
of
you
as
a
man
and
if
any
of
your
little
schemes
touch
dottie
or
peggy
in
any
way
shape
or
form
i
kill
you
as
i
would
a
snake
or
rather
i
take
you
apart
as
i
would
any
other
piece
of
scientific
apparatus
this
is
a
threat
it
a
promise
get
me
perfectly
for
many
hours
the
earth
had
been
obscured
by
clouds
so
that
the
pilot
had
only
a
general
idea
of
what
part
of
the
world
was
beneath
them
but
as
they
dropped
rapidly
downward
into
the
twilight
zone
the
clouds
parted
and
they
saw
that
they
were
directly
over
the
panama
canal
seaton
allowed
the
skylark
to
fall
to
within
ten
miles
of
the
ground
when
he
stopped
so
that
martin
could
get
his
bearings
and
calculate
the
course
to
washington
which
would
be
in
total
darkness
before
their
arrival
duquesne
had
retired
cold
and
reticent
as
usual
glancing
quickly
about
his
cabin
to
make
sure
that
he
had
overlooked
nothing
he
could
take
with
him
he
opened
a
locker
exposing
to
view
four
suits
which
he
had
made
in
his
spare
time
each
adapted
to
a
particular
method
of
escape
from
the
skylark
the
one
he
selected
was
of
heavy
canvas
braced
with
steel
netting
equipped
with
helmet
and
and
attached
to
a
strong
heavy
parachute
he
put
it
on
tested
all
its
parts
and
made
his
way
unobserved
to
one
of
the
doors
in
the
lower
part
of
the
vessel
thus
when
the
chance
for
escape
came
he
was
ready
for
it
as
the
skylark
paused
over
the
isthmus
his
lips
parted
in
a
sardonic
smile
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
air
closing
the
door
behind
him
as
he
fell
the
neutral
color
of
the
parachute
was
lost
in
the
gathering
twilight
a
few
seconds
after
he
left
the
vessel
the
course
laid
seaton
turned
almost
due
north
and
the
skylark
tore
through
the
air
after
a
short
time
when
half
the
ground
had
been
covered
seaton
spoke
suddenly
forgot
about
duquesne
mart
we
better
iron
him
had
we
then
we
decide
whether
we
want
to
keep
him
or
turn
him
loose
i
will
go
fetch
him
replied
crane
and
turned
to
the
stairs
he
returned
shortly
with
the
news
of
the
flight
of
the
captive
hm
he
must
have
made
himself
a
parachute
i
did
think
even
he
would
tackle
a
drop
i
tell
the
world
that
he
sure
has
established
a
record
i
ca
say
i
sorry
that
he
got
away
though
we
can
get
him
again
any
time
we
want
him
anyway
as
that
little
in
my
drawer
is
still
looking
right
at
him
said
seaton
i
think
he
earned
his
liberty
declared
dorothy
stoutly
and
margaret
added
he
deserves
to
be
shot
but
i
glad
he
gone
he
gives
me
the
shivers
at
the
end
of
the
calculated
time
they
saw
the
lights
of
a
large
city
beneath
them
and
crane
fingers
clenched
upon
seaton
arm
as
he
pointed
downward
there
were
the
of
crane
field
seven
searchlights
throwing
their
mighty
beams
upward
into
the
night
nine
weeks
dick
he
said
unsteadily
and
shiro
would
have
kept
them
burning
nine
years
if
necessary
the
skylark
dropped
easily
to
the
ground
in
front
of
the
testing
shed
and
the
wanderers
leaped
out
to
be
greeted
by
the
jap
shiro
ready
vocabulary
of
peculiar
but
sonorous
words
failed
him
completely
and
he
bent
himself
double
in
a
bow
his
yellow
face
wreathed
in
the
widest
possible
smile
crane
one
arm
around
his
wife
seized
shiro
hand
and
wrung
it
in
silence
seaton
swept
dorothy
off
her
feet
pressing
her
slender
form
against
his
powerful
body
her
arms
tightened
about
his
neck
as
they
kissed
each
other
fervently
and
he
whispered
in
her
ear
sweetheart
wife
is
it
great
to
be
back
on
our
good
old
earth
