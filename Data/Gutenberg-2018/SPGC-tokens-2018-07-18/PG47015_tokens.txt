preface
eleven
years
have
elapsed
since
the
writer
s
first
work
on
mars
was
published
in
which
were
recorded
the
facts
gleaned
in
his
research
up
to
that
time
and
in
which
was
set
forth
a
theory
of
their
explanation
continued
work
in
the
interval
has
confirmed
the
conclusions
there
stated
sometimes
in
quite
unexpected
ways
five
times
during
that
period
mars
has
approached
the
earth
within
suitable
scanning
distance
and
been
subjected
to
careful
and
prolonged
scrutiny
familiarity
with
the
subject
improved
telescopic
means
and
training
have
all
combined
to
increased
efficiency
in
the
procuring
of
data
and
to
results
which
have
been
proportionate
a
mass
of
new
material
has
thus
been
collected
of
it
along
old
lines
some
of
it
in
lines
that
are
themselves
new
both
have
led
to
the
same
outcome
in
addition
to
thus
pushing
inquiry
into
advanced
portions
of
the
subject
study
has
been
spent
in
investigation
of
the
reality
of
the
phenomena
upon
which
so
much
is
based
and
in
testing
every
theory
which
has
been
suggested
to
account
for
them
from
diplopia
to
optical
interference
each
of
these
has
been
examined
and
found
incompatible
with
the
observations
the
phenomena
are
all
they
have
been
stated
to
be
and
more
each
step
forward
in
observation
has
confirmed
the
genuineness
of
those
that
went
before
to
set
forth
science
in
a
popular
that
is
in
a
generally
understandable
form
is
as
obligatory
as
to
present
it
in
a
more
technical
manner
if
men
are
to
benefit
by
it
it
must
be
expressed
to
their
comprehension
to
do
this
should
be
feasible
for
him
who
is
master
of
his
subject
and
is
both
the
best
test
of
and
the
best
training
to
that
post
especially
vital
is
it
that
the
exposition
should
be
done
at
first
hand
for
to
describe
what
a
man
has
himself
discovered
comes
as
near
as
possible
to
making
a
reader
the
of
it
not
only
are
thus
escaped
the
mistaken
glosses
of
knowledge
but
an
aroma
of
actuality
which
can
not
be
filtered
through
another
mind
without
sensible
evaporation
clings
to
the
account
of
the
pioneer
nor
is
it
so
hard
to
make
any
matter
comprehensible
to
a
man
of
good
general
intelligence
as
is
commonly
supposed
the
whole
object
of
science
is
to
synthesize
and
so
simplify
and
did
we
but
know
the
uttermost
of
a
subject
we
could
make
it
singularly
clear
meanwhile
technical
phraseology
useful
as
shorthand
to
the
cult
becomes
meaningless
jargon
to
the
uninitiate
and
is
paraded
most
by
the
least
profound
but
worse
still
for
their
employ
symbols
tend
to
fictitious
understanding
formulæ
are
the
anæsthetics
of
thought
not
its
stimulants
and
to
make
any
one
think
is
far
better
worth
while
than
cramming
him
with
and
therefore
indigestible
learning
even
to
the
technical
student
a
popular
book
if
well
done
may
yield
most
valuable
results
for
nothing
in
any
branch
of
science
is
so
little
known
as
its
articulation
the
skeleton
of
it
is
put
together
and
what
may
be
the
mode
of
attachment
of
its
muscles

travel
and

have
called
with
strange
insistence
to
him
who
wondering
on
the
world
felt
adventure
in
his
veins
the
leaving
familiar
sights
and
faces
to
push
forth
into
the
unknown
has
with
magnetic
force
drawn
the
bold
to
great
endeavor
and
fired
the
thought
of
those
who
stayed
at
home
spur
to
enterprise
since
man
first
was
this
spirit
has
urged
him
over
the
habitable
globe
linked
in
part
to
mere
matter
of
support
it
led
the
more
daring
of
the
aryans
to
quit
the
shade
of
their
beech
trees
reposeful
as
that
umbrage
may
have
been
and
wander
into
central
asia
so
to
perplex
philologists
into
believing
them
to
have
originated
there
it
lured
columbus
across
the
waste
of
waters
and
caused
his
son
to
have
carved
upon
his

columbus
gave
it
drove
the
early
voyagers
into
the
heart
of
the
vast
wilderness
there
to
endure
all
hardship
so
that
they
might
come
where
their
kind
had
never
stood
before
and
now
it
points
man
to
the
pole
something
of
the
selfsame
spirit
finds
a
farther
field
today
outside
the
confines
of
our
traversable
earth
science
which
has
caused
the
world
to
shrink
and
dwindle
has
been
no
less
busy
bringing
near
what
in
the
past
seemed
inaccessibly
remote
beyond
our
earth
man
s
penetration
has
found
it
possible
to
pierce
and
in
its
widening
circle
of
research
has
latterly
been
made
aware
of
another
world
of
strange
enticement
across
the
depths
of
space
planetary
distances
not
mundane
ones
are
here
concerned
and
the
globe
to
be
explored
though
akin
to
is
yet
very
different
from
our
own
this
other
world
is
the
planet
mars
sundered
from
us
by
the
ocean
of
ether
a
of
our
own
community
of
matter
there
makes
its
circuit
of
the
sun
upon
whose
face
features
show
which
stamp
it
as
cognate
to
that
on
which
we
live
in
spite
of
the
millions
of
miles
of
intervening
matterless
void
upon
it
markings
can
be
made
out
that
distantly
resemble
our
earth
s
topography
and
grow
increasingly
suggestive
as
vision
shapes
them
better
and
yet
among
the
seemingly
familiar
reveal
aspects
which
are
completely
strange
but
more
than
this
over
the
face
of
it
sweep
changes
that
show
it
to
be
not
a
dead
but
a
living
world
like
ours
in
this
and
luring
curiosity
by
details
unknown
here
to
further
exploration
of
its
unfamiliar
ground
to
observe
mars
is
to
embark
upon
this
enterprise
not
in
body
but
in
mind
though
parted
by
a
gulf
more
impassable
than
any
sea
the
telescope
lets
us
traverse
what
otherwise
had
been
barred
and
lands
us
at
last
above
the
shores
we
went
forth
to
seek
real
the
journey
is
though
incorporeal
in
kind
since
the
seeing
strange
sights
is
the
essence
of
all
far
wanderings
it
is
as
truly
travel
so
the
eye
arrive
as
if
the
body
kept
it
company
indeed
sight
is
our
only
far
viatic
sense
touch
and
taste
both
hang
on
contact
smell
stands
indebted
to
the
near
and
even
hearing
waits
on
ponderable
matter
where
sound
soon
dissipates
away
only
sight
soars
untrammeled
of
the
grosser
adjunct
of
the
flesh
to
penetrate
what
were
otherwise
unfathomable
space
what
the
voyager
thus
finds
himself
envisaging
shares
by
that
very
fact
in
the
expansion
of
the
sense
that
brought
him
there
no
longer
tied
by
means
of
transport
to
seas
his
sails
may
compass
or
lands
his
feet
may
tread
the
traveler
reaches
a
goal
removed
in
kind
from
his
own
habitat
he
proves
to
have
adventured
not
into
unknown
parts
of
a
known
world
but
into
one
new
to
him
in
its
entirety
in
extent
alone
he
surveys
what
dwarfs
the
explorer
s
conquests
on
earth
but
size
is
the
least
of
the
surprises
there
in
store
for
him
what
confronts
his
gaze
finds
commonly
no
counterpart
on
earth
his
previous
knowledge
stands
him
in
scant
stead
for
he
faces
what
is
so
removed
from
every
day
experience
that
analogy
no
longer
offers
itself
with
safety
as
a
guide
he
must
build
up
new
conceptions
from
fresh
data
and
slowly
proceed
to
deduce
the
meaning
they
may
contain
science
alone
can
help
him
to
interpretation
of
what
he
finds
and
above
all
must
he
wean
himself
from
human
prejudice
and
earthbound
limitation
for
he
deals
here
with
ultramundane
things
with
just
enough
of
cosmogony
in
common
to
make
decipherment
not
despairable
this
world
is
yet
so
different
from
the
one
he
personally
knows
as
to
whet
curiosity
at
every
turn
he
is
permitted
to
perceive
what
piques
inquiry
and
by
patient
adding
of
point
to
point
promises
at
last
a
rational
result
like
mundane
exploration
it
is
arduous
too
astra
per
is
here
literally
true
for
it
is
a
journey
not
devoid
of
hardship
and
discomfort
by
the
way
its
preludes
as
much
to
get
conditions
proper
for
his
work
the
explorer
must
forego
the
haunts
of
men
and
even
those
terrestrial
spots
found
by
them
most
habitable
astronomy
now
demands
bodily
abstraction
of
its
devotee
its
deities
are
gods
that
veil
themselves
amid
marts
and
impose
withdrawal
and
seclusion
for
the
prosecution
of
their
cult
as
much
as
any
worshiped
for
other
reason
in
more
primeval
times
to
see
into
the
beyond
requires
purity
in
the
medium
now
as
formerly
in
the
man
as
little
air
as
may
be
and
that
only
of
the
best
is
obligatory
to
his
enterprise
and
the
securing
it
makes
him
perforce
a
hermit
from
his
kind
he
must
abandon
cities
and
forego
plains
only
in
places
raised
above
and
aloof
from
men
can
he
profitably
pursue
his
search
places
where
nature
never
meant
him
to
dwell
and
admonishes
him
of
the
fact
by
sundry
hints
of
a
more
or
less
distressing
character
to
stand
a
mile
and
a
half
nearer
the
stars
is
not
to
stand
immune
thus
it
comes
about
that
today
besides
its
temples
erected
in
cities
monasteries
in
the
wilds
are
being
dedicated
to
astronomy
as
in
the
past
to
faith
monasteries
made
to
commune
with
its
spirit
as
temples
are
to
communicate
the
letter
of
its
law
pioneers
in
such
profession
those
already
in
existence
are
but
the
precursors
of
many
yet
to
come
as
science
shall
more
and
more
recognize
their
need
advance
in
knowledge
demands
what
they
alone
can
give
primitive
too
they
must
be
as
befits
the
still
austere
sincerity
of
a
cult
in
which
the
simplest
structures
are
found
to
be
the
best
still
the
very
wildness
of
the
life
their
devotee
is
forced
to
lead
has
in
it
a
certain
fittingness
for
his
post
in
its
primeval
detachment
from
the
too
earthbound
in
concept
as
in
circumstance
withdrawn
from
contact
with
his
kind
he
is
by
that
much
raised
above
human
prejudice
and
limitation
to
sally
forth
into
the
untrod
wilderness
in
the
cold
and
dark
of
a
winter
s
small
hours
of
the
morning
with
the
snow
feet
deep
upon
the
ground
and
the
frosty
stars
for
mute
companionship
is
almost
to
forget
one
s
self
a
man
for
the
solemn
awe
of
one
s
surroundings
fitting
portal
to
communion
with
another
world
it
is
through
such
avenue
one
enters
on
his
quest
where
the
common
and
familiar
no
longer
jostle
the
unknown
and
the
strange
nor
is
the
stillness
of
the
stars
invaded
when
some
long
unearthly
howl
like
the
wail
of
a
lost
soul
breaks
the
slumber
of
the
mesa
forest
marking
the
prowling
presence
of
a
stray
coyote
gone
as
it
came
it
dies
in
the
distance
on
the
air
that
gave
it
birth
and
the
gloom
of
the
pines
swallows
up
one
s
vain
peering
after
something
palpable
their
tops
alone
decipherable
in
dark
silhouette
against
the
sky
from
amid
surroundings
that
for
their
height
and
their
intenancy
fringe
the
absolute
silence
of

must

it

planetary
world
illustration
but
the
isolation
of
his
journey
is
not
always
so
forbidding
his
coming
back
is
no
less
girt
with
grandeur
of
a
different
though
equally
detached
a
kind
even
before
the
stars
begin
to
dim
in
warning
to
him
to
return

faint
suffusion
as
of
light
creeps
into
the
border
of

it

far
horizon
mesa

in

lines
of

earth
stands
forth
dark
marshaled
in

gloom
informed
with
prescience
of
what
is
soon
to
come
imperceptibly
the
pallor
grows
blanching
the
face
of
night
and
one
by
one
extinguishing
the
stars
slowly
then
it
takes
on
color
tingeing
ever
so
faintly
to
a
flush

never
adventured
himself
upon

more
than
this
an

it
was
in
the

of
americus
vespucius
who
first
discovered
the

by
recognizing

columbus
never

that

does
it
impair
one

of
his

nothing
can
deprive
him
of
the
imperishable
fame
of
launching
forth
into
the
void
in
hope
of
a
beyond
though
he
found
not
what
he
sought
but
something
stranger
still
so
curiously
has
it
been
with
the
to
schiaparelli
the
republic
of
science
owes
a
new
and
vast
domain
his
genius
first
detected
those
strange
new
markings
on
the
martian
disk
which
have
proved
the
portal
to
all
that
has
since
been
seen
and
his
courage
in
the
face
of
universal
condemnation
led
to
exploration
of
them
he
made
there
voyage
after
voyage
much
as
columbus
did
on

with
even
less
of
recognition
from
home
as
with
columbus
too
the
full
import
of
his
great
discovery
lay
hid
even
to
him

discoveries

gradually
resulting

the

of

the

will
be

goes
the
conditions
most
conducive
to
good
seeing
turn
out
to
lie
in
one
or
other
of
the
two
great
desert
belts
that
girdle
the

many
of
us
are
unaware
of
the
existence
of
such
belts
and
yet
they
are
among
the
most
striking
features
of
physical
geography
could
we
get
off
our
globe
and
view
it
from
without
we
should
mark
two
bands
of

to
the
poleward
side
of
either
tropic
where
the
surface
itself
lay
patently
exposed
unclothed
of
verdure
themselves
they
would
stand
forth
doubly
clear
by
contrast
for

hide
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
the
actual
configuration
of
the
earth
s
topography
to
an

scanning
it
from

one
of
these
belts
of
desert
runs
through

sahara
arabia
petræa
and
the
desert
of

the
other
traverses
peru
the
south
african
veldt
and
western
australia
they
are
desert
because
in
them
rain
is
rare
and
even
clouds
seldom
form
in
a
twofold
way
they
conduce
to
astronomic
ends
absence
of
rain
makes
primarily
for
clear
skies
and
secondarily
for
steady
air
and
the
one
of
these
conditions
is
no
less
vital
to
sight
than
the
other
water

is
a
great
upsetter
of

equilibrium
and
commotion
in

the
spoiler
of

thus
from
the
cloudlessness
of
their
skies
man
finds
in
them
most
chance
of
uninterrupted
communion
with
the
stars
while
by
suitably
choosing
his
spot
he
here
obtains
as
well
that
prime
desideratum
for
planetary
work
as
near
a
heavenly
equanimity
in
the

over
his
head
as
is
practically
possible
from
the
fact
that
these
regions
are
desert
they
are
less
frequented
of
man
and
the
observer
is
thus
perforce
isolated
by
the
nature
of
the
case
the
regions
best
adapted
to
mankind
being
the
least
suited
to
astronomic
observations
in
addition
to
what
nature
has
thus
done
in

has
further

in

of

made
surprising
progress
with
a
success
only
too
undesirable
his
habitat
has
gradually
become
canopied
by
a
welkin
of
his

has
rendered
it

the

into

already

advanced
they
are
symptomatic
of
the
passing
of

into
a
purely
terrestrial
one

come

therefore
it

appearance
upon

as
it
does
for
the
approach
of

it
may
be
likened
to
the

better
still
it

to

distinctive
of
the

those
which

a
bearing
on

considerable
attention
it
helps
directly
to
an
understanding

though
partial
only
the
features

traits
of
our

sufficiently

everyday
possibility

one
the
terrible
necessity
of
water
to
all
forms

that
in
the
simple

the
only

to
one
a
deeper
realization
of
what
is
really
vital
and
what
but
accessory
at

one
begins
to
conceive
what
must
be
the
controlling
principle
of
a
world
where
water
is
only
with
difficulty
to
be
had
and
rain
unknown

in

to
the
fundamental
importance
of
water
the
relative
irrelevancy
of
some
other
conditions
usually
deemed
indispensable
to
organic
existence
there
find

to
this

has
been
added
one
by
flammarion
which
though
not
solely
from
his
own
work
gives
so
just
a
representation
of
what
was
known
at
the
date
as
to
merit
inclusion
the
remarkable
drawings
of
dawes
and
the
excellent
ones
of
lockyer
in
were
never
combined
into
maps
by
the
observers
and
though
the
former
s
were
so
synthesized
by
proctor
in
the
result
was
conformed
to
what
proctor
thought
ought
to
be
and
so
is
not
really
a
transcript
of
the
drawings
themselves
each
of
the
maps
presented
marked
in
its
day
the
point
areography
had
reached
and
each
tells
its
own
story
better
than
any
amount
of
text
they
are
all
made
upon
mercator
s
projection
and
omit
in
consequence
the
circumpolar
regions
the
later
ones
give
too
only
so
much
of
the
surface
as
was
shown
at
the
opposition
they
record
for
mars
being
tipped
now
one
way
now
another
regards
the
earth
differently
according
to
its
orbital
position
in
comparing
them
therefore
the
equator
must
be
taken
for
medial
line
mercator
s
projection
has
been
the
customary
one
for
portraying
mars
except
for
such
oppositions
as
chiefly
disclose
the
arctic
pole
and
this
too
with
a
certain
poetic
fitness
for
it
comes
by
right
of
priority
to
delineation
of
a
new
world
seeing
that
mercator
was
the
first
to
represent
in
a
map
the
mundane
new
world
in
its
entirety
by
the
rather
important
addition
of
north
america
to
the
southern
continent
already
known
and
to
give
the
whole
the
title
america
with
ame
at
the
top
of
the
map
and
rica
at
the
bottom
in
looking
at
the
maps
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
they
are
what
we
should
call
upside
down

standing
at
the
top
and
north
at
the

show
because
this
is
the
way
the
telescopic
observer
always
sees
the

the

seem
unnatural
to
astronomers
were
it
duly
righted
just
the
same
do
men
in
the

look
at
our
own
earth
according
to
our

the

the
north
of
them
and
the

certain
landmarks

for

introduction
the

make
a
case
in
point
it
was
to
his
canals
that
schiaparelli
gave
heed
to
the
neglect
of
a
due
toning
of
his
map
while
green
less

more
artistic
missed
the
delicate
canaliform
detail
to
make
a
speaking
portraiture
of
the
whole
amid
the
remarkable
continuity
of
progression
here
shown
in
which
each
map
will
be
seen
to
be
at
once
a
review
and
an
advance
we
may
nevertheless
distinguish
three
stages
in
the
perception
of
the
phenomena
thus
we
may
mark
i
a
period
of
recognition
of
larger
markings
only
ii
a
period
of
detection
of
canals
intersecting
the
bright
regions
or
lands
iii
a
period
of
detection
of
canals
traversing
the
seas
and
of
oases
scattered
over
the
surface
each
period
is
here
represented
by
four
charts
and
each
expresses
the
result
of
a
more
minute
and
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
disk
than
was
possible
to
the
one
that
went
before
to
realize
however
how
accurate
each
was
according
to
his
lights
it
is
only
necessary
to
have
the
seeing
grow
steadily
better
some
evening
as
one
observes
he
will
find
himself
recapitulating
in
his
own
person
the
course
taken
by
discovery
for
all
those
who
went
before
and
in
the
lapse
of
an
hour
live
through
the
observational
experience
of
sixty
years
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
embryological
growth
of
an
individual
repeats
the
development
historically
of
the
race
two
verses
of
ovid
which
the
poet
puts
into
the
mouth
of
pythagoras
outline
with
something
like
prophetic
utterance
the
special
discoveries
which
mark
the
three
periods
apart
ovid

pythagoras
say
of

tells
what
has
since
been
learned
of
the
character
of
the
seas
of
the
three
periods
the
first
was
that
of
the
main
or
fundamental
markings
only
it
came
in
with
beer
and
maedler
the
inaugurators
of
areography
that
they
planned
and
executed
their
survey
with
but
a
glass
shows
that
there
is
always
room
for
genius
at
the
top
of
any
profession
and
that
instruments
are
not
for
everything
in
its
instrumentality
up
to
their
day
the
reality
of
the
planet
s
features
had
been
questioned
by
some
people
in
spite
of
having
been
certainly
seen
and
drawn
by
huyghens
and
others
beer
and
maedler
s
labors
proved
them
permanent
facts
beyond
the
possibility
of
dispute
the
second
period
was
the
period
of
the
discovery
of
the
now
famous
canals
new
era
in
the
study
of
mars
opened
by
schiaparelli
in
map
v
unsuspicious
of
what
he
was
to
stumble
on
he
seized
the
then
favorable
opposition
to
make
as
he
put
it
a
geodetic
survey
of
the
planet
s
surface
he
hoped
this
undertaking
feasible
to
the
accuracy
of
micrometric
measurement
his
hopes
did
not
belie
him
he
found
that
it
was
possible
to
measure
his
positions
with
sufficient
exactness
to
make
a
skeleton
map
on
which
to
embody
the
markings
in
thus
to
give
his
map
vertebrate
support
but
in
the
course
of
his
work
he
became
aware
of
hitherto
unrecognized
ligaments
connecting
the
seas
with
one
another
instead
of
displaying
a
broad
unity
of
face
the
bright
areas
appeared
to
be
but
groundwork
for
streaks
the
streaks
traversed
them
in
all
directions
tesselating
the
continents
into
a
tilework
of
islands
such
mosaic
was
not
only
new
but
the
fashion
of
the
thing
was
of
a
new
order
or
kind
straits
however
schiaparelli
considered
them
and
gave
them
the
name
or
channels
how
unfamiliar
and
seemingly
impossible
the
new
detail
was
is
best
evidenced
by
the
prompt
and
unanimous
disbelief
with
which
it
was
met

schiaparelli

on
in
the
judgment
of
his
critics
from
bad
to
in

he
took
up
again
his
scrutiny
of
the

to
the
detecting
of
yet
more
particularity
he
most
of
his
old
canals
and
discovered
half
as
many
more
and
as
his
map
shows
he
perceived
an
increased
regularity
in
his
lines
in

vii
he
attacked
the
planet
again
and
with
results
yet
further
out
of
the
common
his
lines
were
still
there
with
more
beside
if
they
had
looked
strange
before
they
now
appeared
positively
unnatural
not
content
with
a
regularity
which
seemed
to
the
sceptics
to
preclude
their
being
facts
he
must
needs
see
them
now
in
duplicate
to
the
eyes
of
disbelief
this
was
the
crowning
stroke
of
factitiousness
in
consequence
no
end
of
adverse
criticism
was
heaped
upon
his
observations
by
those
who
could
not
see
but
curiously
enough
did
not
attract
attention
blindness
of
the
critics

as
much
mental
as
bodily
for
they
failed
to
perceive
that
the
very
unnaturalness
which
seemed
to
them
to
discredit
his
observations
really
proved
their
genuineness
his
discoveries
were
so
amazing
that
any
change
in
strangeness
simply
went
to
confirm
the
universal
scepticism
and
clouded
logic
yet
properly
viewed
a
pregnant
deduction
stands
forth
quite
clearly
on
a
study

on
comparing
maps
v
vi
and
vii
an
eye
duly
directed
is
struck
by
a
difference
in
the
aspect
of
the
lines
in
his
first
map
the
canals
are
depicted
simply
as
narrow
winding
streaks
hardly
even
roughly
regular
and
by
no
means
such
departures
from
the
plausible
as
to
lie
without
the
communicatory
pale
indeed
to
a
modern
reader
prepared
beforehand
for
geometric
construction
they
will
probably
appear
no
canals
at
all
certainly
the
price
of
acceptance
was
not
a
large
one
to
pay
but
like
that
of
the
sibylline
books
it
increased
with
putting
off
what
he
offered
the
public
in
was
much
more
dearly
to
be
bought
the
lines
were
straighter
narrower
and
in
every
way
less
natural
than
they
had
seemed
two
years
before
in
they
progressed
still
more
in
unaccountability
they
had
now
become
regular
rule
and
compass
lines
as
straight
as
even
and
as
precise
as
any
draughtsman
could
wish
and
quite
what
astronomic
faith
did
not
desire
having
thus
donned
the
character
they
nevermore
put
it
off
now
this
curious
evolution
in
depiction
points
rightly
viewed
to
an
absence
of
design
it
shows
that
schiaparelli
started
with
no
preconceived
idea
on
the
subject
on
the
contrary
it
is
clear
that
he
shared
to
begin
with
the
prevailing
hesitancy
to
accept
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
nor
did
he
overcome
his
reluctance
except
as
by
degrees
he
was
compelled
for
the
canals
did
not
change
their
characteristics
from
one
opposition
to
another
the
eye
it
was
that
learned
to
distinguish
what
it
saw
and
the
brain
made
better
report
as
it
grew
familiar
with
the
messages
sent
it
in
other
words
it
is
patent
from
these
successive
maps
that
the
geometrical
character
of
the
canals
was
forced
upon
schiaparelli
by
the
things
themselves
instead
of
being
as
his
critics
took
for
granted
foisted
on
them
by
him
we
have
since
seen
the
regularity
of
the
canals
so
undeniably
that
we
are
not
now
in
need
of
such
inferential
support
to
help
us
to
the
truth
but
too
late
as
it
is
to
be
of
controversial
moment
the
deduction
is
none
the
less
of
some
corroboratory
force
with
the
third
period
enters
what
has
been
done
since
schiaparelli
s
time
for
that
master
was
obliged
from
failing
sight
to
close
his
work
with
the
opposition
of
in
pickering
at
arequipa
was
the
chief
observer
of
the
planet
and
made
two
important
discoveries
one
was
the
detection
of
small
round
spots
scattered
over
the
surface
of
the
planet
and
connected
with
the
canal
system
the
other
the
perception
of
what
seemed
to
him
more
or
less
irregular
lines
traversing
the
mare
erythraeum
both
were
notable
detections
the
first
set
of
phenomena
he
called
lakes
the
second
sometimes
schematically
canals
but
without
committing
himself
to
canaliform
characteristics
as
his
drawings
make
clear
the
same
phenomena
were
seen
at
that
opposition
at
the
lick
by
schaeberle
barnard
and
others
and
called
streaks
these
discoveries
took
from
the
their
supposed
character
of
most
important
event
in
knowledge
of
mars

the
next
advance
was
the
detection
at
flagstaff
in
of
their
canaliform
characteristics
by
my
then
assistant
douglass
who
in
place
of
the
irregular
streaks
and
of
his
predecessors
found
the
seas
to
be
crossed
by
lines
as
regular
and
as
regularly
connected
as
the
canals
in
the
light
regions
to
him
they
appeared
broad
and
ill
defined
but
so
habitually
did
to
him
the
canals
in
the
light
areas
while
for
directness
and
uniformity
the
one
set
showed
as
geometrically
perfect
as
the
other
all
the
dark
of
the
southern
hemisphere
he
found
to
be
laced
with
them
and
that
they
formed
a
network
over
the
dark
regions
counterparting
that
over
the
light
still
more
significant
was
the
fact
that
their
points
of
departure
coincided
with
the
points
of
arrival
of
the
canals
so
that
the
two
connected
to
form
in
its
entirety
a
single
system
after
the
publication
of
his
results

identified
some
of
those
in
the
syrtis
with
what
he
had
himself
seen
there
in

though
his
own
had
not
been
sufficiently
well
seen
of
him
to
impress
him
as
canals
of
other
additions
to
our
knowledge
since
made
by
the
writer
the
present
book
treats
as
also
of
the
theory
they
originally
suggested
to
him
and
which
his
later
observations
have
only
gone
to
confirm
chapter

the

as
soon

a

markings
white
spots
crowning

spread
with
patches
on
an
orange

the

capable
of
this
revelation

with
increased
power
the
picture
grows
steadily

articulate

full
with
a

a
quarter

glass
the

saw
them
years
ago
after
the
assurance
that
markings
exist
the
next
thing
to
arrest
attention
is
that
these
markings
move
the
patches
of
color
first
made
out
by
the
observer
are
shortly
found
by
him
to
have
shifted
in
place

the

this
not
through
mistake
on
his
part

through

so
swift
that
a

minutes
will
suffice

unmistakably
the
fact
of
such
procession
but
for
all
this
ceaseless
turning
under
his
gaze
after
a
certain
lapse
of
time
it
is
evident
that
the
same
features
are
being
shown
him
over
again
with
such
recognition
of
recurrence

the
first
advance
toward
acquaintance

the

permanent

part
and

of
the
solid

of
that
other
globe
this
surface
then
lies
exposed
to
view
and
by
its
turning
shows
itself
subject
like
our
earth
to
the
vicissitudes
of
day
and
night
in
such
mars
differs
from
all
the
four
great
planets
jupiter
saturn
uranus
and
neptune
features
indeed
are
apparent
on
the
first
two
of
these
globes
and
dimly
on
the
other
two
as
well
but
they
lack
the
stability
of
the
martian
markings
they
are
forever
exchanging
place
in
the
case
of
jupiter
what
we
see
is
undoubtedly
a
through
which
occasional
glimpses
may
possibly
be
caught
of
a
chaotic
nucleus
below
with
saturn
it
is
the
same
and
the
evidence
is
that
the
like
is
true
of
uranus
and
neptune
what
goes
on
under
their
great
cloud
canopies
we
can
only
surmise
with
mars
however
we
are
not
left
to
imagination
in
the
matter
but
so
far
as
our
means
permit
can
actually
observe
what
there
takes
place
except
for
distance
which
through
science
year
by
year
grows
less
it
is
as
if
we
hovered
above
the
planet
in
a
balloon
with
its
various
features
spread
out
to
our
gaze
below
attention
shows
these
areographic
features
to
be
on
hand
with
punctual
precision
for
their
traverse
of
the
disk
once
every
hours
and
minutes
for
over
two
hundred
years
this
has
been
the
case
their
untiring
revolutions
having
been
watched
so
well
that
we
know
the
time
they
take
to
the
nicety
of
a
couple
of
hundredths
of
a
second
we
thus
become
possessed
of
a
knowledge
of
the
length
of
the
martian
day
and
it
is
not
a
little
interesting
to
find
that
it
very
closely
counterparts
in
duration
our
own
being
only
one
the
longer
of
the
two
we
also
find
from
the
course
the
markings
pursue
the
axis
about
which
they
turn
and
just
as
the
period
of
the
rotation
tells
us
the
length
of
the
martian
day
so
the
tilt
of
the
axis
taken
in
connection
with
the
form
of
the
orbit
determines
the
character
of
the
martian
seasons
here
again
we
confront
a
curious
resemblance
in
the
circumstances
of
the
two
planets
for
the
tilt
of
the
equator
to
the
plane
of
the
orbit
is
with
mars
almost
precisely
what
it
is
for
the
earth
the
more
carefully
the
two
are
measured
the
closer
the
similitude
becomes
sir
william
herschel
made
the
martian
schiaparelli
reduced
this
to
and
later
determination
by
the
writer
puts
it
nearer
the
latter
is
the
one
now
adopted
in
the
british
nautical
almanac
for
observers
of
the
planet
this
is
a
very
close
parallelism
indeed
so
that
in
general
character
the
martian
seasons
are
nearly
the
counterpart
of
ours
in
length
however
they
differ
first
because
the
year
of
mars
is
almost
double
the
length
of
the
terrestrial
one
and
secondly
because
from
the
greater
ellipticity
of
mars
orbit
the
seasons
are
more
unequal
than
is
the
case
with
us
some
being
run
through
with
great
haste
others
being
lingered
on
a
disproportionate
time
it
is
usual
on
the
earth
to
consider
spring
as
the
period
from
the
vernal
equinox
about
march
to
the
summer
solstice
about
june
summer
as
lasting
thence
to
the
autumnal
equinox
autumn
from
this
latter
date
about
september
to
the
winter
solstice
on
december
and
winter
from
that
point
on
to
the
next
spring
equinox
again
on
this
division
our
seasons
in
the
northern
hemisphere
last
respectively
spring
days
summer
days
autumn
days
and
winter
days
on
mars
these
become
reckoned
in
our
days
spring
days
summer
days
autumn
days
and
winter
days
if
we
had
counted
them
in
martian
days
they
would
have
totaled
about
one
less
in
number
each
in
its
days
and
seasons
then
mars
is
wonderfully
like
the
earth
except
for
the
length
of
the
year
we
should
hardly
know
the
difference
in
reckoning
of
time
could
we
some
morning
wake
up
there
instead
of
here
only
in
one
really
unimportant
respect
should
we
feel
strange
in
months
we
should
find
ourselves
turned
but
lunations
have
nothing
to
do
with
climate
nor
with
the
alternation
between
night
and
day
and
in
these
two
important
respects
we
should
certainly
feel
at
home
though
the
axis
could
be
determined
by
the
daily
march
of
any
marking
and
thus
the
planet
s
tropic
temperate
and
polar
regions
marked
out
the
process
is
made
easier
by
the
presence
of
white
patches
covering
the
planet
s
poles
and
known
in
consequence
as
the
polar
caps
it
is
from
measures
of
the
patches
that
the
position
of
the
martian
poles
has
actually
been
determined
these
polar
caps
are
exactly
analogous
in
general
position
to
those
which
bonnet
our
own
earth
they
reproduce
the
appearance
of
the
ice
and
snow
of
our
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
seen
from
space
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
in
truth
they
are
things
of
note
in
more
ways
than
one
and
would
claim
precedence
on
many
counts
priority
of
recognition
however
alone
entitles
them
to
premier
consideration
among
the
very
first
of
the
disk
s
detail
to
be
made
out
by
man
they
justly
demand
description
first
with
peculiar
propriety
the
polar
caps
have
thus
the
not
only
do
they
stand
first
in
order
of
visibility
but
they
prove
to
occupy
a
like
position
logically
when
it
comes
to
an
explanation
of
the
planet
s
present
physical
state
it
is
not
matter
of
hazard
that
the
most
evident
of
all
the
planet
s
markings
should
also
be
the
most
fundamental
the
fountainhead
from
which
everything
else
flows
it
is
of
the
essence
of
the
planet
s
condition
and
furnishes
the
key
to
its
comprehension
the
steps
leading
to
this
conclusion
are
as
interesting
as
they
are
cogent
they
start
at
the
polar
caps
visibility
for
their
size
first
riveted
man
s
attention
and
then
attention
to
them
disclosed
that
most
vital
of
the
characteristics
of
the
planet
s
surface
change
just
as
almost
all
of
the
features
we
note
are
permanent
in
place
showing
that
they
belong
to
the
surface
so
are

all
impermanent

the
only
absolutely
unchanging
thing
except

about
the
features
the
planet
presents
to
view
it
was
in
the
aspect
of
the
polar
caps
that
this
important
fact
first
came
to
light
not
only
did
they
thus
initially
instance
a
general
law
they
have
turned
out
to
make
it
for
by
themselves
changing
they
largely
cause
change
in
all
the
rest
but
for
a
long
time
they
alone
exemplified
its
workings
to
sir
william
herschel
we
owe
the
first
study
of
their
change
in
aspect
this
eminent
observer
noted
that
their
varying
size
was
subject
to
a
regular
rhythmic
wax
and
wane
timed
to
the
course
of
the
seasons
of
the
planet
s
year
the
caps
increased
in
the
winter
of
their
hemisphere
and
decreased
in
its
summer
and
being
situate
in
opposite
hemispheres
they
did
this
alternately
with
precision
his
observations
were
soon
abundantly
confirmed
for
the
phenomena
take
place
upon
a
vast
scale
and
are
thus
easy
of
recognition
at
their
maximum
spread
the
caps
cover
more
than
one
hundred
times
as
much
ground
as
when
they
have
shrunk
to
their
minimum
in
the
depth

they
stretch
over
much
more
than
the
polar

coming
down
to
and
even

north
or
south
as
the
case
may
be
thence
melting
till
by
midsummer
they

only
five
or
six

this

analogue

our
own

would
show
not
otherwise
were
they
viewed
from
the
impersonal
standpoint
of

very
little

suffices
to
disclose
the
martian

in
this
their
more
salient
characteristics
and
convince
an
observer
of
their
likeness
to
those
of
the
earth
any
one
may
note
what
is
there
going
on
by
successive
observations
of
the
planet
with
a
glass
nor
is
the
change
by
any
means
slow
a
few
days
at
the
proper
martian
season
or
at
most
a
couple
of
weeks
produces
conspicuous
and
conclusive
alterations
in
the
size
of
these
nightcaps
of
the
planet
s
winter

resembling
our
own
so
well
they
were
early
surmised
to
be
of
like
constitution
and
composed
therefore
of
ice
and
snow
plausible
on
its
face
this
view
of
them
was
generally
adopted
and
common
sense
has
held
to
it
ever
since
it
has
encountered
of
course
opposition
partly
from
very
proper
conservatism
but
chiefly
from
that
philosophy
which
has
doubted
most
advances
since
galileo
s
time
and
carbonic
acid
has
been
put
forward
by
this
school
of
sceptics
to
take
its
place
we
shall
critically
examine
both
objections
the
latter
first
because
a
certain
physical
fact
enables
us
to
dispose
of
it
at
once
in
casual
appearance
there
is
not
much
to
choose
between
the
rival
candidates
of
common
sense
and
uncommon
subtlety
water
and
frozen
carbonic
acid
gas
both
being
suitably
white
and
both
going
and
coming
with
the
temperature
but
upon
closer
study
in
one
point
of
behavior
the
two
substances
act
quite
unlike
and
had
half
the
ingenuity
been
expended
in
testing
the
theory
as
in
broaching
it
this
fact
had
come
to
light
to
the
suggestors
as
it
did
upon
examination
to
the
writer
and
had
served
as
a
touchstone
in
the
case
at
pressures
of
anything
like
one
atmosphere
or
less
carbonic
acid
passes
at
once
from
the
solid
to
the
gaseous
state
water
on
the
other
hand
lingers
in
the
intermediate
stage
of
a
liquid
now
as
the
martian
cap
melts
it
shows
surrounded
by
a
deep
blue
band
which
accompanies
it
in
its
retreat
shrinking
to
keep
pace
with
the
shrinkage
in
the
cap
this
is
clearly
the
product
of
the
disintegration
since
it
waits
so
studiously
upon
it
the
substance
composing
the
cap
then
does
not
pass
instantaneously
or
anything
like
it
from
the
solid
to
the
gaseous
condition
this
badge
of
blue
ribbon
about
the
melting
cap
therefore
conclusively
shows
that
carbonic
acid
is
not
what
we
see
and
leaves
us
with
the
only
alternative

know
of
water

therefore
largely
from

it
the
southern
end
of
franz
joseph
land
opposite
this
in
longitude
west
above
the
north
american
continent
it
reaches
down
lower
still
to
so
that
the
cap
is
then
from
twenty
to
thirty
degrees
in
diameter
in
the
southern
hemisphere
it
is
even
larger
in
longitude
west
the
land
was
found
by
ross
to
be
under
perpetual
snow
in
latitude
cook
had
reached
in
longitude
east
an
impassable
barrier
of
ice
in
latitude
the
season
was
then
midsummer
january
so
that
we
are
perhaps
justified
in
considering
south
as
about
the
average
limit
of
perpetual
snow
or
paleocrystic
ice
this
would
make
the
southern
cap
at
its
minimum
degrees
across
with
open
spots
extends
still
farther
north
the
pagoda
in
was
stopped
by
impenetrable
in
south
latitude
and
the
challenger
in
encountered
the
pack
in
latitude
on
the
of
february
which
corresponds
about
to
our
of
august
the
time
at
which
the
sea
should
be
most
open
the
limit
of
perpetual
snow
is
thus
lower
in
the
southern
than
in
the
northern
hemisphere
here
again
then
the
two
minima
differ
but
in
the
reverse
way
from
what
they
do
on
mars
from
this
we
perceive
that
the
variations
in
size
of
the
caps
are
much
more
striking
on
mars
than
on
the
earth
and
that
these
are
due
chiefly
to
the
difference
in
the
minima
the
maxima
not
varying
greatly
to
explain
these
interesting
diversities
of
behavior
in
the
several
polar
caps
we
shall
have
to
go
back
a
little
in
general
physics
in
order
to
get
a
proper
take
off
it
is
a
curious
concomitant
of
the
law
of
gravity
that
the
amount
of
heat
received
by
a
planet
in
passing
from
any
point
of
its
path
to
a
point
diametrically
opposite
is
always
the
same
no
matter
what
be
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
thus
a
planet
has
as
many
calories
falling
upon
it
in
travelling
from
its
vernal
equinox
to
its
autumnal
as
from
the
autumnal
to
the
vernal
again
although
the
time
taken
in
the
one
journey
be
very
different
from
that
of
the
other
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
angle
swept
over
by
the
radius
vector
that
is
the
imaginary
bond
between
it
and
the
sun
is
at
all
points
proportional
to
the
amount
of
heat
received
just
as
it
is
of
the
gravity
undergone
the
two
forces
radiating
into
space
as
the
inverse
square
of
the
distance
thus
the
heat
received
by
a
point
or
a
hemisphere
through
any
orbital
angle
is
independent
of
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
but
it
is
not
independent
of
the
axial
tilt
for
the
force
of
the
sun
s
rays
is
modified
by
their
obliquity
the
amount
of
heat
received
at
any
point
in
consequence
of
the
tilt
turns
upon
the
position
of
the
point
and
for
any
hemisphere
taken
as
a
whole
it
depends
upon
the
degree
to
which
the
pole
is
tilted
to
the
source
of
heat
in
consequence
of
being
more
squarely
presented
to
its
beams
the
hemisphere
which
is
directed
toward
the
sun
and
therefore
is
passing
through
its
summer
season
gets
far
more
insolation
than
that
which
is
at
the
same
time
in
the
depth
of
its
winter
for
a
tilt
of
degrees
the
present
received
value
for
the
axis
of
mars
the
two
hemispheres
so
circumstanced
get
amounts
of
heat
respectively
in
the
proportion
of
to
but
though
the
summer
and
winter
insolation
thus
differ
they
are
the
same
for
each
hemisphere
in
turn
consequently
the
mere
amount
of
heat
received
can
not
be
the
cause
of
any
differences
detected
between
the
respective
maxima
and
minima
of
the
two
polar
caps
if
heat
were
a
substance
which
could
be
stored
up
instead
of
being
a
mode
of
motion
the
effect
produced
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
quantity
applied
and
the
two
caps
would
behave
alike
as
it
is
the
total
amount
has
very
little
to
say
in
the
matter
not
the
amount
of
heat
but
the
manner
in
which
this
heat
is
made
at
home
is
responsible
for
the
difference
we
observe
now
though
the
total
amount
is
the
same
in
passing
from
the
vernal
to
the
autumnal
equinox
as
from
the
autumnal
to
the
vernal
the
time
during
which
it
is
received
in
either
case
varies
from
one
hemisphere
to
the
other
it
is
summer
in
the
former
while
it
is
winter
in
the
latter
and
the
difference
in
the
length
of
the
two
seasons
due
to
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
makes
a
vast
difference
in
the
result
winter
affects
the
maxima
summer
the
minima
attained
of
these
opposite
variations
presented
to
us
by
the
two
caps
the
maxima
the
one
most
difficult
to
detect
is
the
easiest
to
explain
for
the
difference
in
the
maxima
seems
to
be
due
to
the
surpassing
length
of
the
antarctic
night
owing
to
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbital
ellipse
pursued
by
mars
and
to
the
present
position
of
the
planet
s
solstices
the
southern
hemisphere
is
farther
away
from
the
sun
during
its
winter
and
is
so
for
a
longer
time
the
seasons
are
in
length
for
the
northern
hemisphere
spring
days
summer
days
autumn
days
and
winter
days
while
for
the
southern
hemisphere
they
are
spring
days
summer
days
autumn
days
and
winter
days
the
arctic
polar
night
is
thus
of
our
days
long
the
antarctic
thus
for
more
days
than
happens
to
its
fellow
the
southern
pole
never
sees
the
sun
now
since
the
total
sunlight
from
equinox
to
equinox
is
the
same
in
both
hemispheres
its
distribution
by
days
must
be
different
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
same
amount
is
crowded
into
a
smaller
compass
in
the
proportion
of
to
that
being
that
hemisphere
s
relative
ratio
of
days
but
since
during
winter
the
cap
increases
there
is
a
daily
excess
of
accumulation
over
dissipation
of
snow
and
each
hours
must
on
the
average
add
its
tithe
to
the
sum
total
since
the
northern
days
are
the
warmer
each
adds
less
than
do
the
southern
ones
and
furthermore
there
are
fewer
of
them
on
both
these
scores
the
amount
of
the
deposition
about
the
northern
pole
should
be
less
than
about
the
southern
one
consequently
the
there
should
be
the
less
extensive
and
show
a
relatively
smaller
maximum
which
explains
what
we
see
with
the
minima
the
action
is
otherwise
inasmuch
as
the
greater
heat
received
during
the
daylight
hours
by
the
southern
hemisphere
is
exactly
offset
by
the
shortness
of
its
season
it
would
seem
at
first
as
if
there
could
be
no
difference
in
the
total
effect
upon
the
two
but
further
consideration
discloses
a
couple
of
factors
which
might
and
possibly
do
come
in
to
qualify
the
action
and
account
for
the
observed
effect
one
is
that
though
the
total
amount
of
heat
received
is
the
same
the
manner
of
its
distribution
differs
in
the
two
hemispheres
in
the
northern
one
the
time
from
vernal
to
autumnal
equinox
is
days
against
in
the
southern
consequently
the
average
daily
heat
is
then
five
fourths
more
intense
in
the
southern
hemisphere
indeed
it
is
even
greater
than
this
and
nearer
four
thirds
because
the
melting
occurs
chiefly
in
the
spring
and
in
the
first
two
months
of
summer
when
the
contrast
in
length
of
season
between
the
two
hemispheres
is
at
its
greatest
now
a
few
hotter
days
might
well
work
more
result
than
many
colder
ones
and
this
would
be
particularly
true
of
mars
where
the
mean
temperature
is
probably
none
too
much
above
the
to
start
with
ice
consumes
so
much
caloric
in
the
process
of
turning
into
any
other
state
laying
it
by
in
the
form
of
latent
heat
before
it
can
turn
into
water
and
then
so
much
more
before
this
water
can
be
converted
into
steam
that
a
good
deal
has
to
be
expended
on
it
before
getting
any
perceptible
result
once
obtained
however
the
heat
is
retained
with
like
tenacity
so
that
the
process
works
to
double
effect
if
sufficient
heat
be
received
the
ice
is
first
melted
then
evaporated
and
finally
formed
into
a
layer
of
humid
air
the
humidity
of
which
keeps
it
warm
dry
air
is
unretentive
of
heat
moist
air
the
opposite
and
for
the
melting
of
the
to
proceed
most
effectively
the
temperature
that
laps
it
about
must
be
as
high
as
possible
and
kept
so
as
continuously
as
may
be
if
between
days
it
be
allowed
to
fall
too
low
at
night
much
caloric
must
needs
be
wasted
in
simply
raising
the
ice
again
to
the
this
a
blanket
of
warm
air
tends
to
prevent
and
this
again
is
brought
about
by
a
few
hot
days
rather
than
by
many
colder
ones
it
is
not
all
the
heat
received
that
becomes
effective
but
the
surplus
heat
above
a
certain
point
the
gain
in
continuity
of
action
thus
brought
about
is
somewhat
like
that
exhibited
between
the
running
of
an
express
and
an
accommodation
train
to
reach
its
destination
in
a
given
time
the
former
requires
far
less
power
because
it
does
not
have
to
get
up
speed
again
after
each
arrest
thus
the
whole
effect
in
melting
the
snow
would
be
greater
upon
that
hemisphere
whose
summer
happens
to
be
the
more
intense
the
greater
swing
in
size
of
the
cap
most
exposed
to
the
effects
of
the
eccentricity
is
then
the
necessary
result
of
circumstances
when
the
precipitation
is
not
too
great
to
be
nearly
carried
off
by
the
subsequent
dissipation
this
is
the
state
of
things
on
mars
and
the
second
of
the
factors
above
referred
to
on
the
earth
as
we
have
seen
the
polar
caps
are
somewhat
larger
at
their
maximum
and
very
much
so
at
their
minimum
now
this
is
just
what
should
happen
were
the
precipitation
increased
suppose
for
example
that
the
amount
of
precipitation
were
to
increase
while
the
amount
of
summer
melting
remained
the
same
and
this
would
be
the
case
if
the
vapor
in
the
air
augmented
for
one
cause
or
another
and
the
result
of
each
fresh
deposit
was
locked
up
in
snow
after
a
certain
point
the
cap
would
grow
in
depth
rather
than
in
extension
the
winter
deposit
would
be
thicker
but
the
summer
evaporation
would
remain
the
same
now
if
this
occurred
it
is
evident
that
the
minimum
size
of
the
cap
would
increase
relatively
much
faster
than
the
maximum
and
furthermore
that
the
relative
increase
of
the
minimum
in
the
two
caps
would
be
greatest
for
that
which
had
seasons
of
extremes
the
result
we
see
in
the
case
of
the
earth
in
the
arctic
cap
where
in
consequence
of
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
the
winter
is
shorter
the
maximum
is
less
than
in
the
antarctic
and
this
extra
amount
of
precipitation
can
not
be
wholly
done
away
with
in
its
intenser
summer
so
that
the
minimum
too
is
greater
there
we
reach
then
this
interesting
conclusion
we
find
that
eccentricity
of
orbit
by
itself
not
only
causes
no
universal
glaciation
in
the
hemisphere
which
we
should
incidentally
suppose
likely
to
show
it
but
actually
produces
the
opposite
result
in
more
than
offsetting
by
summer
proximity
what
winter
distance
brings
about
to
cause
extensive
glaciation
we
must
have
in
addition
to
favorable
eccentricity
a
large
precipitation
with
these
two
factors
combined
we
get
an
ice
age
but
not
otherwise
the
result
has
an
important
bearing
on
geologic
glacial
periods
and
their
explanation
once
formed
an
cools
everything
about
it
and
chills
the
climate
of
its
hemisphere
it
is
a
perpetual
storehouse
of
cold
mars
has
no
such
general
glaciation
in
either
hemisphere
and
the
absence
of
it
which
is
due
to
lesser
precipitation
together
with
the
clearness
of
its
skies
accounts
for
the
warmth
which
the
surface
exhibits
and
which
has
been
found
so
hard
hitherto
to
interpret
could
our
earth
but
get
rid
of
its
oceans
we
too
might
have
temperate
regions
stretching
to
the
poles
chapter

martian
polar

polar
expeditions
exert
an
extreme
attraction
on
certain
minds
perhaps
because
they
combine
the
maximum
of
hardship
with
the
minimum
of
headway
inconclusiveness
certainly
enables
them
to
be
constantly
renewed
without
loss
either
of
purpose
or
prestige
the
fact
that
the
pole
has
never
been
trod
by
man
constitutes
the
lodestone
to
such
undertakings
and
that
it
continues
to
defy
him

whets
his
endeavor
the
more
except
for
the
demonstration
of
the
polar
conceived
of

then
verified
by
nansen
very
little
has
been
added
by
them
to
our
knowledge
of
the

nor
is
there
specific
reason
to
suppose
that
what
they
might
add
would
be
particularly
vital
nothing
out
of
the
way
is
suspected
of
the

the
simple
fact
of
being
so
positioned
yet
for
their
patent
inconclusion
they
continue
to
be
sent
in
sublime
superiority
to
failure
martian
polar
expeditions
as
undertaken
by
the
astronomer
are
the
antipodes
of
these
pleasingly
perilous
excursions
in
three
important
regards
which
if
less
appealing
to
the
gallery
commend
themselves
to
the
philosopher
they
involve
comparatively
little
hardship
they
have
accomplished
what
they
set
out
to
do
and
the
knowledge
they
have
gleaned
has
proved
fundamental
to
an
understanding
of
the
present
physical
condition
of
the
planet
the
antithesis
in
between
the
two
planets
manifests
itself
at
the
threshold
of
the
inquiry
in
the
relative
feasibility
with
which
the
phenomena
on
mars
may
be
scanned
for
curiously
enough
instead
of
being
the
pole
and
its
surrounding
paleocrystic
ice
which
remains
hidden
on
mars
it
is
rather
the
extreme
extent
of
its
extension
and
the
lowest
latitudinal
deposit
of
frost
which
lies
shrouded
in
mystery
the
difficulty
there
is
not
to
see
the
pole
but
to
see
in
winter
the
regions
from
which
our
own
expeditions
set
out
and
this
because
the
poles
are
well
displayed
to
us
at
times
which
are
neither
few
nor
very
far
between
while
favorable
occasions
for
marking
the
edge
of
the
caps
when
at
their
greatest
have
neither
proved
so
numerous
nor
so
favorable
the
tilt
of
the
planet
s
axis
when
conveniently
placed
for
human
observation
has
been
the
cause
of
the
one
drawback
the
planet
s
meteorological
condition
in
those
latitudes
at
that
season
the
reason
for
the

what

in

when
first
the
hemisphere
the
pole
of
which
has
for
half
a
martian
year
been
turned
away
from
the
sun
begins
to
emerge
from
its
long
hibernation
the
which
covers
it
down
even
to
temperate

presents
an
undelimited
expanse
of
white
the
edges
of
which
merge
indistinguishably
into
the
groundwork
color
of
the
regions
round
about
of
a
dull
opaque
hue
along
its
border
its
contour
is
not
sharp
but
fades
off
in
a
fleecy
fringe
without
hard
and
fast
line
of
demarcation
such
notably
was
the
aspect
of
the
north
temperate
zone
in
when
tilted
as
it
then
was
away
from
us
into
a
mere
northern
horizon
of
the
planet
s
limb
it
showed
prior
to
the
definite
recognition
of
the
north
polar
cap
in
august
of
that
year
and
such
too
was
the
look
of
the
disk
s
southern
edge
both
before
and
after
the
first
certain
detection
of
the
southern
cap
in
and
each
was
then
in
the
depth
of
winter
for
in
martian
chronology
the
season
corresponded
in
each
at
the
time
to
what
we
know
in
our
northern
hemisphere
as
the
latter
part
of
february
and
the
early
part
of
march
and
the
appearance
of
the
planet
s
surface
in
both
was
not
unlike
what
we
know
at
the
same
season
in
latitude
indeed
there
is
reason
to
suppose
bad
weather
there
then
and
the
extreme
fringe
from
the
pale
tint
it
exhibited
to
have
been
cloud
rather
than
snow
it
is
quite
in
keeping
with
what
we
know
on
earth
or
can
conceive
of
elsewhere
that
such
aspect
should
characterize
the
cap
at
or
near
the
attainment
of
its
greatest
development

it
were
not

at
this
of
its
career

slightly
passed

vagueness
of

in

event

the

were
the
frost

show

and
on

it
just

give

the
melting

in

quantities

be

its
behavior
subsequent
to
recognition

out
the
inference
from
its
aspect
when
it
first
appeared
while
for
many
days
prior
to
its
coming
unmistakably
into
view
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
what
was
seen
of
the
southern
cap
in
and
was
cloud
or
snow
so
even
after
it
had
definitely
disclosed
itself
it
continued
to
play
at
odds
with
the
observer
showing
sharp
at
the
edges

day
it
would
appear

hazily
defined
the

clearly

itself

at
the

knowledge
of
either
cap
in
this
the
midwinter
of
its
year
has
been
a
matter
of
the
most
recent
oppositions
of
the
planet
up
to
within
the
last
few
years
our
acquaintance
with
either
cap
was
chiefly
confined
to
the
months
might
almost
say
the
weeks
surrounding
the
summer
solstice
of
its
respective
hemisphere
the
behavior
of
the
caps
during
the
rest
of
their
career
was
largely
unknown
to
us
from
the
very
disadvantageous
positions
they
occupied
at
the
times
the
planet
was
nearest
to
the
earth
beginning
with
however
our
knowledge
of
both
has
been
much
extended
by
a
proportionate
extension
of
the
period
covered
by
the
observations
it
used
to
be
thought
impracticable
to
observe
the
planet
far
on
either
side
of
opposition
now
it
is
observed
from
as
much
as
four
months
before
that
event
to
the
same
period
after
it
the
result
is
a
systematic
series
of
observations
which
in
many
ways
has
given
unexpected
insight
into
martian
conditions
one
of
the
benefits
secured
has
been
the
lengthening
of
the
period
of
study
of
the
cap
s
career
a
pushing
of
inquiry
farther
back
into
its
spring
history
and
a
longer
lingering
with
it
in
its
autumnal
rebuilding
yet
up
to
the
very
last
opposition
a
gap
in
its
chronology
still
remained
between
february
and
april
the
opposition
of
has
bridged
this
hiatus
and
brought
us
down
to
the
latter
date
at
which
the
melting
of
the
cap
begins
in
earnest
from
this
point
april
on
we
have
abundant
evidence
of
the
cap
s
behavior
its
career
now
for
some
time
is
one
long
chronicle
of
contraction
like
balzac
s
de
it
simply
shrinks
giving
out
of
its
virtue
in
the
process
the
cap
proceeds
to
dwindle
almost
under
the
observer
s
eye
till
from
an
enormous
white
counterpane
spread
over
all
the
polar
and
a
large
part
of
the
temperate
zone
its
area
contracts
to
but
the
veriest
nightcap
of
what
it
was
before
from
seventy
degrees
across
it
becomes
sixty
then
fifty
then
forty
till
by
the
middle
of
the
martian
may
it
has
become
not
more
than
thirty
degrees
in
diameter
during
this
time
from
the
moment
the
melting
began
in
good
earnest
the
retreating
white
is
girdled
by
a
dark
band
of
a
blue
tint
which
keeps
pace
with
the
edge
of
the
cap
shrinking
as
it
shrinks
and
diminishing
in
width
as
the
volume
of
the
melting
decreases
after
the
melting
has
been
for
some
time
under
way
and
the
cap
has
become
permanently
bordered
by
its
dark
blue
band
a
peculiar
phenomenon
makes
its
appearance
in
the
cap
itself
this
is
its
fission
into
one
or
more
parts
the
process
begins
by
the
appearance
of
dark
rifts
which
starting
in
from
the
cap
s
exterior
penetrate
into
its
heart
until
at
last
they
cleave
it
in
two
rifts
have
been
seen
by
several
observers
and
in
both
caps
and
what
is
most
suggestive
they
always
appear
in
the
same
places
year
after
year
sometimes
oppositions
elapse
between
their
several
detections
for
they
are
not
the
least
difficult
of
detail
but
when
they
are
caught
they
prove
to
lie
just
where
they
did
before
the
permanency
in
place
of
the
rifts
a
characteristic
true
of
them
all
shows
them
to
be
of
local
habit
thus
the
rift
of
and
reappeared
again
to
another
observer
in
the
same
position
in
they
are
therefore
features
of
or
directly
dependent
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
but
it
will
not
do
from
this
fact
to
infer
that
they
are
expressive
of
depressions
there
the
evidence
is
conclusive
that
great
irregularities
of
surface
do
not
exist
on
mars
as
we
shall
see
when
we
come
to
consider
the
orology
of
the
planet
it
is
certain
that
elevations
there
of
over
two
or
three
thousand
feet
in
altitude
are
absent
differences
of
temperature
able
to
explain
a
melting
of
the
ice
in
one
locality
coincidentally
with
its
retention
in
an
adjacent
one
must
in
consequence
be
unknown
and
this
much
more
conclusively
than
at
first
appears
for
the
reason
that
the
smaller
the
planet
s
mass
the
less
rapidly
does
its
blanket
of
air
thin
out
in
ascent
above
the
surface
this
is
in
consequence
of
the
greater
pull
the
larger
body
exerts
and
the
greater
density
it
imparts
to
a
compressible
gas
like
our
atmosphere
gravity
acts
like
any
force
producing
pressure
and
by
it
the
envelope
of
air
is
squeezed
into
a
smaller
compass
but
as
this
is
done
throughout
the
atmospheric
layer
it
means
a
more
rapid
rarefaction
as
one
leaves
the
body
the
action
is
such
that
the
height
necessary
to
reach
an
analogic
density
varies
inversely
as
the
gravity
of
the
mass
in
consequence
of
this
to
compass
a
relative
thermometric
fall
for
which
a
moderate
difference
of
elevation
would
suffice
on
earth
an
immoderate
one
must
be
made
on
mars
for
gravity
there
being
but
three
eighths
what
it
is
here
eight
thirds
the
rise
must
be
made
to
attain
a
proportionate
lowering
of
temperature
this
fact
renders
the
above
argument
against
elevation
and
depression
being
the
cause
of
the
phenomenon
three
times
as
cogent
as
it
otherwise
would
be
with
so
gradual
a
gradient
in
barometric
pressure
there
and
so
low
a
set
of
contour
lines
altitude
must
be
a
negligible
factor
in
martian
surface
meteorologic
phenomena
both
density
and
temperature
can
be
but
little
affected
by
such
cause
and
we
must
search
elsewhere
for
explanation
of
what
surface
peculiarities
we
detect
meanwhile
the
rifts
themselves
from
being
lines
which
penetrate
the
cap
from
its
periphery
in
toward
its
centre
end
by
traversing
it
in
its
entirety
and
separating
portions
which
becoming
outlying
subsidiary
patches
themselves
proceed
to
dwindle
and
eventually
disappear
the
rifts
usually
take
their
rise
from
such
broader
parts
of
the
blue
belt
as
make
beads
upon
that
cordon
and
are
clearly
spots
where
the
product
of
the
melting
of
the
cap
is
either
specially
collected
or
produces
its
most
visible
effect
so
far
the
description
might
apply
with
substantial
accuracy
to
either
cap
yet
the
conduct
of
the
two
is
in
some
ways
diverse
and
begins
to
accentuate
itself
from
this
point
on
illustration
northern
cap
hooded
with
vapor
from
the
time
that
the
north
polar
cap
reaches
a
diameter
of
about
degrees
a
singular
change
steals
over
it
from
having
been
up
to
then
of
a
outline
it
now
proceeds
to
grow
hazy
and
indistinct
all
along
its
edge
this
change
in
its
character
at
the
same
period
of
its
career
has
been
quite
noticeable
at
each
of
the
three
last
oppositions
so
that
small
doubt
remains
that
the
metamorphosis
is
a
regularly
recurrent
one
in
the
history
of
the
cap
coincident
with
the
obliteration
of
its
contour
its
dimensions
seemingly
enlarge
it
is
as
if
a
hood
had
been
drawn
over
the
cap
of
a
dull
white
different
from
the
dazzling
brilliance
of
the
cap
itself
and
covering
more
ground
such
is
probably
what
occurs
with
vapor
for
veil
the
excessive
melting
of
the
cap
produces
an
extensive
evaporation
which
then
in
part
condenses
to
be
deposited
afresh
in
part
remains
as
a
covering
shutting
off
from
our
view
the
outlines
of
the
cap
itself
it
would
seem
that
at
this
time
the
cap
melts
faster
than
the
air
can
carry
it
off
a
sort
of
steaming
appears
to
be
going
on
taking
place
for
it
clearly

not
wafted

the

of
its
coming

significant
for
the
season

height
of

a
spring

to
set
in
then
later
it
dissipates
with
the
same
quiet
indefiniteness
with
which
it
gathered

unmasked
it
is
some
time
in
martian
june
before
the
spring
haze
clears
away
and
when
it
does
go
only
a
tiny
polar
cap
stands
revealed
beneath
it
from
six
to
eight
degrees
across
or
from
a
tenth
to
a
fifteenth
of
what
it
was
when
it
passed
into
its
curious
spring
chrysalis
the
date
of
emergence
varies

not
being
marked
after

though
recurring
again
at
intervals
for
a
day
or
so
in
it
was
later
perceptibly
thin
after

it
did
not
certainly
clear
away
till
june
and
came
back
again
on
july
and
possibly
on
the
these
vicissitudes
of
aspect
give
us
glimpses
into
a
sweet
unreasonableness
in
martian
weather
which
makes
it
seem
more
akin
to
our
own
and
this
on
two
counts
diurnal
and
annual
from
day
to
day
atmospheric
conditions
shift
for
purely
local
cause
while
furthermore
successive
martian
years
are
not
alike
in
some
the
season
is
early
in
others
late
so
that
mars
is
no
more
exempt
than
are
we
from
the
wantonness
of
weather
clearly
disclosed
thus
reduced
to
its
smallest
possible
terms
it
remains
for
some
months
of
our
days
for
six
weeks
of
its
own
during
that
period
it
continues
practically
unchanged
neither
increasing
nor
decreasing
significantly
in
size
nor
altering
notably
in
aspect
measures
of
the
drawings
of
it
then
make
it
from
five
to
eight
degrees
across
and
it
is
possible
that
it
really
fluctuates
between
narrow
limits
though
its
outline
at
all
times
renders
the
variation
difficult
to
explain
we
are
not
so
near
it
as
we
could
wish
for
on
these
occasions
even
at
their
best
it
is
over
two
hundred
times
as
distant
as
the
moon
and
the
greatest
magnification
possible
still
leaves
it
a
hundred
thousand
miles
away
to
the
south
polar
cap
a
somewhat
similar
history
attaches
but
with
a
difference
in
its
case
no
such
regularly
recurrent
spring
haze
has
yet
been
noted
the
melting
of
this
cap
would
seem
to
be
of
a
more
orderly
nature
than
its
fellow
and
not
to
outdo
what
can
conveniently
be
carried
off
that
an
excess
of
evaporation
should
not
take
place
is
the
more
peculiar
from
the
fact
that
at
its
maximum
it
is
the
larger
of
the
two
and
therefore
has
the
greater
quantity
of
matter
to
get
rid
of
its
summer
also
is
shorter
than
the
arctic
one
so
that
it
has
the
less
time
to
dispose
of
its
accumulations
the
only
other
respect
in
which
it
seems
to
be
differently
circumstanced
from
its
antipodes
is
in
the
character
of
its
surroundings
about
it
are
large
areas
which
with
intermissions
stretch
down
in
places
to
within
less
than
ten
degrees
of
the
equator
whereas
the
other
pole
is
continuously
encircled
for
long
distances
by
practically
uninterrupted
ochre
the
character
of
the
environment
seems
thus
the
only
thing
that
can
account
for
the
difference
in
behavior
and
this
proves
the
more
plausible
when
we
come
to
consider
what
those
two
classes
of
regions
respectively
represent
in
other
ways
as
well
the
southern
cap
is
the
more
the
rifts
indeed
break
it
up
into
separate
portions
and
these
in
part
remain
as
outlying
detachments
of
the
main
body
as
was
notably
the
case
in
and
in
but
they
hardly
have
the
permanency
and
importance
of
those
similarly
formed
about
the
arctic
pole
nothing
antarctic
for
instance
compares
with
the
subsidiary
patch
of
the
north
polar
regions
lying
in
longitude
which
both
in
schiaparelli
s
time
and
during
the
late
oppositions
as
well
was
almost
as
fixed
a
feature
of
the
arctic
zone
as
the
cap
proper
not
quite
so
constant
however
and
not
so
a
landmark
is
this
patch
for
all
its
extent
which
nearly
equals
the
area
of
the
more
legitimate
portion
it
bears
on
its
face
a
more
pallid
complexion
as
if
it
were
thinner
and
this
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
it
occasionally
disappears
an
event
which
so
far
at
least
has
never
befallen
the
northern
cap
itself
less
constant
the
southern
one
is
to
its
own
minimum
than
the
northern
in
some
seasons
in
most
in
fact
it
reaches
like
the
other
a
more
or
less
definite
limit
of
diminution
which
it
does
not
pass
but
this
is
not
always
the
case
in
it
disappeared
entirely
at
the
height
of
its
midsummer
the
season
was
probably
unusually
hot
then
in
the
southern
hemisphere
of
mars
in
position
the
caps
have
something
to
say
about
physiographic
conditions
both
caps
at
their
minima
are
then
irregular
and
the
centre
of
the
south
one
is
markedly
eccentric
to
the
areographic
pole
it
lies
some
six
degrees
north
along
the
thirtieth
meridian
the
northern
one
is
also
probably
eccentric
but
much
less
so
with
a
divergence
not
much
exceeding
a
degree
and
of
doubtful
orientation
not
only
are
both
caps
not
upon
their
respective
poles
but
they
are
not
opposite
each
other
the
one
lying
in
longitude
the
other
in
this
speaks
of
course
for
local
action
in
some
wise
this
must
depend
on
the
configuration
of
the
surface
yet
so
far
as
markings
go
there
is
nothing
to
show
what
the
dependence
is
the
eccentring
of
the
caps
is
paralleled
by
the
like
state
of
things
on
earth
the
pole
of
cold
does
not
coincide
in
either
hemisphere
with
the
geographic
pole
on
the
earth
its
position
is
largely
determined
by
the
distribution
of
the
continents
are
not
such
equalizers
of
heat
as
oceans
because
of
their
conductivity
on
the
one
hand
and
their
immobility
on
the
other
in
winter
they
part
with
their
heat
more
quickly
and
convection
currents
can
not
supply
the
loss
this
accounting
for
thermal
pole
eccentricity
is
inapplicable
to
mars
because
of
the
absence
there
of
bodies
of
water
and
it
is
significant
that
the
degree
the
earthly
poles
of
cold
are
out
much
exceeds
what
is
the
case
on
mars
possibly
areas
of
vegetation
there
replace
to
some
effect
areas
of
water
it
is
certainly
in
favor
of
this
view
that
the
arctic
regions
there
are
more
desert
than
the
antarctic
and
that
the
north
pole
of
cold
occupies
more
squarely
the
geographic
pole
not
till
did
the
actual
starting
again
of
either
cap
chance
to
be
seen
nor
was
this
indeed
a
matter
of
hazard
but
of
persistent
inquiry
by
observation
prolonged
after
the
planet
had
got
so
far
away
that
its
scanning
had
hitherto
been
discontinued
such
search
beyond
the
customary
limits
of
observation
was
essential
to
success
because
of
the
relation
of
the
axial
tilt
to
the
position
of
the
planet
in
its
orbit
at
an
opposition
well
placed
for
nearness
the
tilt
is
such
as
largely
to
hide
the
pole
and
to
present
the
polar
regions
too
obliquely
to
view
for
effective
scanning
this
is
true
both
of
the
arctic
and
the
antarctic
regions
in
turn
for
the
martian
axis
being
inclined
somewhat
as
our
own
is
to
the
plane
of
the
planet
s
orbit
we
at
times
see
well
and
at
times
but
poorly
the
arctic
or
antarctic
zones
the
cap
the
starting
to
form
of
which
was
thus
caught
was
the
arctic
one
the
date
days
after
the
northern
summer
solstice
or
thereabouts
for
as
is
perhaps
natural
the
advent
of
the
phenomenon
partook
of
the
wavelike
advance
of
such
things
familiar
on
earth
an
advance
succeeded
by
a
recession
and
then
followed
by
another
advance
so
much
is
proof
of
local
weather
there
as
here
was
successively
deposited
and
then
melted
off
illustration
deposition
of
frost
what
is
significant
the
deposition
of
the
frost
took
place
simultaneously
over
large
areas
the
very
first
patch
of
it
in
about
longitude
extended
at
one
stroke
down
to
latitude
for
it
actually
crossed
the
pierius
somewhat
to
the
south
a
second
patch
stretched
to
the
east
of
the
cap
two
wings
these
made
to
the
kernel
of

itself
through
the
wings
could
be
marked
the
line
of
the
canal
the
pierius
upon
the
one
side
the
enipeus
upon
the
other
such
visibility
of
the
canals
through
the
white
stretches
proved
the
white
not
to
be
due
to
cloud
suspended
between
us
and
them
but
a
surface
deposit
which
found
no
lodgment
upon
the
canals
themselves
the
same
avoidance
of
dark
markings
was
evidenced
by
the
showing
of
the
dark
rim
round
the
cap
s
kernel
now
if
the
deposit
were
indeed
hoarfrost
this
failure
to
find
permanent
foothold
on
the
dark
markings
is
what
we
should
expect
to
witness
for
whether
they
were
vegetation
or
water
equally
in
either
case
the
frost
would
melt
from
them
first
probably
they
were
both
vegetal
though
some
doubt
might
exist
about
the
latter

band
around
the
kernel

was
then
august

hemisphere
such
deposition
over
great
stretches
of
country

perhaps
not
so
surprising
as
it
appears
at

seen
from

white

in

and
to
the

that
often
in

summer
flank
them
round
about

from

to

be

upon

differ
in

as

from
the

sparkle
on

with

with

they
remain

during
the

of

are
themselves
though
by
no

their

is
reckoned
by

that
when

they
show
in

unaffected

and
this
fact
taken
in
connection
with
the
character
of
their
habitat
is
the
puzzling
point
about
them
for
they
affect
chiefly
the
north
tropic
belt
they
or
at
least
their
nuclei
are
small
about
two
or
three
degrees
in
diameter
and
are
not
particularly
easy
of
detection
as
a
rule
though
certain
larger
ones
are
at
times
conspicuous
chromatic
rather
than
formal
definition
is
necessary
to
their
bringing
out
as
is
witnessed
by
the
superb
colors
the
disk
presents
at
the
times
when
they
are
best
seen
it
is
then
that
mars
puts
on
the
look
of
a
the
first
such
spot
to
be
noticed
was
one
which
schiaparelli
detected
in
at
the
second
opposition
in
which
he
studied
the
planet
he
called
it
the
nix
olympica
showing
that
he
recognized
in
it
a
cousinship
to
the
polar
snows
yet
it
lay
in
latitude
north
longitude
in
the
midst
of
the
ochre
stretches
of
that
part
of
the
disk
it
was
a
small
roundish
white
speck
of
not
more
than
two
thirds
the
diameter
of
the
polar
cap
reseen
by
him
in
it
failed
to
appear
at
subsequent
oppositions
and
was
not
caught
again
until
then
once
more
it
vanished
not
to
be
detected
anew
till
many
years
after
at
flagstaff
coming
out
rather
surprisingly
in
it
showed
however
in
the
same
place
as
before
so
that
its
position
but
not
its
existence
is
permanent
a
similar
but
smaller
patch
was
apparent
to
schiaparelli
at
the
same
opposition
of
this
one
which
he
styled
the
nix
atlantica
lay
between
the
thoth
and
the
syrtis
major
it
was
about
half
the
size
of
the
nix

has
never
since
been

should
have

it

phenomena
of
the
sort
undetected
of
schiaparelli
have
been
remarked
at
flagstaff
on
may
i
was
suddenly
struck
by
the
singular
whiteness
of
the
southeast
corner
of
elysium
where
that
region
bordered
the
trivium
elysium
has
a
way
of
being
bright
but
not
with
such
startling
intensity
as
this
spot
presented
nor
in
so
restricted
an
area
as
was
here
the
case
the
spot
was
so
much
whiter
than
anything
i
had
ever
previously
seen
outside
the
polar
caps
that
it
arrested
my
attention
at
once
and
this
the
more
that
i
had
observed
this
same
part
of
the
planet
the
day
before
and
perceived
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
once
detected
however
the
spot
continued
visible
the
next
day
it
was
there
with
equal
conspicuousness
and
now
thrust
an
arm
across
the
cerberus
entirely
obliterating
the
canal
for
the
space
of
several
degrees
in
this
salience
it
remained
day
after
day
till
the
region
passed
from
sight
to
reappear
with
it
six
weeks
later
when
the
region
again
rounded
into
view
the
hour
of
the
martian
day
seemed
to
make
no
difference
in
its
visibility
it
was
seen
from
early
morning
till
martian
afternoon
as
late
as
the
phase
permitted
clearly
there
was
nothing
diurnal
about
its
revealing
and
it
lasted
for
at
least
three
months
and
a
half
until
the
planet
got
so
far
away
that
observations
were
discontinued
it
was
to
all
appearances
and
intents
snow
but
now
comes
the
singular
fact
about
it
it
lay
within
ten
degrees
of
the
equator
and
showed
from
the
end
of
june
to
the
latter
part
of
august
to
our
ideas
there
could
be
no
more
inopportune
place
or
time
for
such
an
exhibition
for
it
can
not
have
been
due
to
a
peak
as
we
know
for
certain
that
there
are
no
mountains
in
this
or
in
any
other
part
of
the
planet
besides
it
had
not
appeared
in
previous
martian
years
which
it
infallibly
would
have
done
had
it
been
a
peak
indeed
it
baffles
explanation
beyond
any
martian
phenomenon
known
to
me
it
seems
directly
to
contradict
every
other
detail
presented
by
the
disk
the
phenomenon
is
thus
unique
in
kind
it
is
not
however
unique
as
a
specimen
of
its
kind
the
eastern
coast
of
aeria
where
that
region
borders
the
syrtis
major
is
prone
to
a
brilliance
of
the
same
sort
it
is
a
narrow
belt
of
country
that
shows
thus
nothing
but
the
coastline
itself
but
this
for
a
considerable
distance
stretching
several
hundred
miles
in
length
it
has
stood
out
saliently
bright
now
at
every
opposition
which
i
have
observed
beginning
with
sometimes
it
has
been
described
in
the
notes
as
bright
simply
sometimes
as
white
and
once
in
as
glistening
at
one
point
like
ice
yet
when
upon
the
terminator
it
has
never
stood
forth
as
a
mountain
range
should
have
done
to
declare
its
character
it
has
been
evident
regardless
apparently
of
the
martian
season

it
was

october
to
january

to

from

in
at
about
the
same
date
and
so
in
it
was
whitest
during
the
latter
oppositions
showing
that
the
effect
is
most
marked
in
its
midsummer
all
of
the
above
instances
of
white
have
been
located
within
the
tropics

of
the
same
thing

region
just
to

exceedingly
given
to

upon
the

border
in
latitude
north
this
spot
too
on
occasion
glitters
as
it

also
at
times
very
small

that
whereas
much
of

is
by

it
is
dazzling

might
be
easily
extended

become
more
numerous
especially
are
such
visible
north
of
the
mare
acidalium
in
the
arctic
region
thereabout
from
to
north
from
so
widespread
a
set
of
instances
the
only
explanation
which
seems
to
fit
the
phenomena
is
that
the
mean
temperature
of
mars
is
low
not
very
much
above
freezing
and
that
whatever
causes
a
local
fall
in
the
temperature
results
in
such
an
explanation
accords
well
with
the
distance
of
the
planet
from
the
sun
and
the
thinness
of
its
atmosphere
at
the
same
time
it
shows
that
the
mean
temperature
over
the
greater
part
of
the
planet
the
greater
part
of
the
time
is
above
the
and
that
consequently
it
is
no
bar
to
vegetation
of
a
suitable
sort
that
the
should
be
found
even
at
the
equator
may
perhaps
be
due
to
the
very
thinness
of
the
of
mars
which
would
tend
to
make
the
actual
insolation
more
of
a
factor
than
it
is
with
us
and
by
the
great
length
of
the
martian
seasons
in
midsummer
the
greatest
insolation
occurs
in
the
arctic
and
temperate
not
in
the
tropic
regions
on
the
other
hand
an
atmosphere
tends
to
accumulate
heat
for
the
tropics
with
us
the
latter
factor
is
prepotent
it
would
be
less
effective
on
mars
then
again
the
double
duration
of
summer
would
tend
to
emphasize
insolation
as
the
important
factor
in
the
matter
but
it
is
possible
that
greater
deposition
plays
a
part
in
the
matter
on
earth
the
rainfall
is
greatest
near
the
equator
and
something
of
the
sort
may
be
true
of
the
zones
of
moisture
on
mars
that
the
most
striking
spots
are
found
to
the
west
of
large
dark
areas
may
in
this
connection
have
a
meaning
inasmuch
as
such
regions
being
the
air
over
them
is
probably
more
one
point
about
the
position
of
the
spots
is
of
moment
they
have
all
been
found
in
the
northern
hemisphere
or
within
ten
degrees
of
it
in
the
southern
equatorial
region
this
seems
at
first
a
question
of
hemispheres
but
when
we
consider
that
the
light
areas
of
the
surface
are
chiefly
in
the
boreal
hemisphere
and
in
the
south
tropic
belt
we
perceive
that
it
may
be
rather
the
character
of
the
surface
there
than
the
particular
hemisphere
in
the
abstract
that
is
decisive
in
the
matter
nevertheless
the
austral
hemisphere
is
the
hemisphere
of
extremes
possessing
a
shorter
hotter
summer
and
a
longer
colder
winter
than
its
antipodes
this
would
not
favor
sporadic
small
depositions
of
frost
in
summer
so
much
as
would
a
climate
of
a
more
mean
temperature
from
the
relative
lack
of
atmospheric
covering
over
the
planet
we
should
expect
the
nights
to
prove
decidedly
cool
while
the
days
were
fairly
warm
of
this
we
have
perhaps
evidence
in
a
singular
aspect
shown
by
the
mare
acidalium
in
june
the
account
of
it
in
the
annals
reads
thus
on
may
an
interesting
and
curious
phenomenon
presented
itself
on
that
day
so
soon
as
the
mare
acidalium
had
well
rounded
the
terminator
on
to
the
disk
at
the
whole
of
its
central
part
showed
white
the
edges
of
the
marking
alone
remaining
as
a
shell
to
this
brilliant
core
so
striking
was
the
effect
that
beside
appearing
in
the
drawing
it
found
echo
in
the
notes
the
next
day
no
mention
is
made
of
it
and
a
drawing
made
under
shows
the
mare
as
usual
and
the
bright
spot
in
tempe
in
its
customary
place
neither
was
anything
of
the
sort
noticed
on
the
and
but
on
the
the
day
of
the
projection
upon
the
terminator
the
effect
of
the
reappeared
the
longitude
of
the
centre
being
fortunately
on
that
day
a
further
drawing
was
secured
which
enabled
its
subsequent
behavior
to
be
followed
made
three
hours
later
than
the
other

longitude
of
the
centre
being
this
drawing
shows
the
mare
well
on
the
disk
its
whole
area
as
dark
as
usual
and
with
tempe
bright
to
the
right
of
it
toward
the
terminator
the
terminator
in
question
was
the
sunrise
one
and
we
are
offered
two
suppositions
in
explanation
of
the

climate
and
weather
in
gazing
at
the
successive
phases
presented
by
the
polar
caps
as
their
annual
history
unrolls
itself
to
view
beginning
with
vast
white
cloaks
that
in

hide
so
effectively
the

shoulders
to

sees

the
mind
s
eye
however
perceives
something
more
the
conviction
they
carry
of
the
presence
of
an
atmosphere
surrounding
the
planet
elusive
as
water
vapor
is
to
sight
for
its
transparency
and
to
spectroscopic
determination
for
its
earthly
omnipresence
recognition
of
its
existence
elsewhere
by
deduction
raises
such
reasoning
at
once
to
a
more
conspicuous
plane
than
it
might
otherwise
assume
especially
is
this
true
where
the
deduction
is
itself
conclusive
as
is
here
the
case
for
it
depends
on
phenomena
not
its
own
but
which
are
in
their
turn
dependent
on
it
we
are
not
even
beholden
to
any
knowledge
of
the
substance
composing
the
caps
for
the
fundamental
inference
that
an
atmosphere
surrounds
them
whatever
that
substance
were
the
fact
that
the
caps
dissipate
and
reform
shows
us
with
absolute
certainty
that
they
pass
into
the
gaseous
state
to
be
later
solidified
afresh
this
gas
constitutes
of
itself
an
atmosphere
while
another
phenomenon
to
wit
their
blue
girdles
as
they
melt
affirming
their
substance
to
be
snow
and
ice
enables
us
to
precise
the
fact
that
this
gas
is
water
vapor
from
such
premise
given
us
by
the
polar
caps
we
are
able
to
infer
much
more
by
the
help
of
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases
but
the
speed
of
parting
by
a
planet
with
its
gases
is
conditioned
by
the
mean
speed
of
each
gas
water
vapor
will
therefore
go
before
nitrogen
oxygen
or
carbonic
acid
gas
if
then
we
find
it
present
over
the
surface
of
a
planet
we
are
assured
of
the
possibility
that
the
other
three
may
be
there
too
and
from
the
similarity
of
matter
in
space
strong
reason
to
suspect
that
they
actually
are
corroborative
evidence
of
the
accuracy
of
the
deduction
as
to
the
presence
of
a
martian
air
is
shown
in
several
other
ways
in
the
existence
of
clouds
to
begin
with
rare
as
they
are
these
certainly
float
at
times
over
parts
of
the
planet
although
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
can
then
be
seen
fortunately
for
assurance
we
have
other
ways
of
ascertaining
their
presence
than
that
of
obscuration
nor
is
it
of
account
to
the
argument
that
they
should
be
few
and
far
between
as
they
unquestionably
are
one
single
instance
of
such
mediumistic
support
is
enough
to
support
the
theory
of
a
medium
and
that
instance
has
been
more
than
once
observed
direct
evidence
of
atmosphere
is
further
forthcoming
in
the
this
phenomenon
might
be
described
as
a
brilliant
obscuration
it
is
a
circlet
of
illumination
that
swamps
the
features
as
they
near
the
full
edge
of
the
disk
the
limb
of
the
planet
as
it
is
called
obliteration
of
the
sort
is
evident
more
or
less
markedly
at
all
times
and
is
not
due
to
foreshortening
as
the
broadest
areas
are
affected
the
fading
out
of
the
detail
at
the
limb
suggests
nothing
so
much
as
a
veil
drawn
between
us
and
it
lighter
in
tint
than
what
it
covers
such
a
veil
can
be
none
other
than
air
or
the
haze
and
cloud
that
air
supports
from
its
effect
impartial
in
place
and
partial
in
character
cloud
is
inadmissible
as
a
cause
and
we
are
left
with
air
charged
with
dust
or
vapor
in
explanation
obscuration
due
to
it
should
prove
most
dense
at
the
limb
since
there
the
eye
has
to
penetrate
a
greater
depth
of
it
just
as
on
the
earth
our
own
air
gives
azure
dimness
to
the
distance
in
deepened
tinting
as
the
mountains
lie
remote
another
bit
of
evidence
lies
in
the
apparent
detection
of
a
twilight
arc
in
measures
made
of
the
polar
and
equatorial
diameters
of
the
planet
showed
certain
systematic
residuals
left
after
all
known
corrections
had
been
applied
the
only
thing
which
would
account
for
them
was
the
supposition
that
a
twilight
arc
had
been
unconsciously
seen
and
as
unconsciously
measured
in
delicate
quantities
of
the
sort
too
great
reliance
can
not
be
put
but
if
the
residuals
be
not
referable
to
other
cause
they
give
us
not
only
further
evidence
of
an
atmosphere
but
at
the
same
time
our
only
hint
of
that
atmosphere
s
extent
from
them
it
would
seem
that
the
air
must
be
rare
not
more
than
about
four
inches
of
barometric
pressure
as
we
reckon
it
and
probably
less
a
thin
high
air
more
rarefied
than
prevails
upon
our
highest
mountain
tops
corroborative
of
this
is
the
aspect
of
the
planet
from
the
general
look
of
the
disk
a
scant
covering
of
air
is
inferable
for
one
of
the
striking
things
about
the
planet
s
features
is
their
patent
exposure
to
our
sight
except
in
the
winter
time
of
its
hemisphere
or
in
the
spring
after
the
greatest
melting
of
the
polar
cap
nothing
seems
to
stand
in
our
way
of
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
surface
whether
in
the
arctic
temperate
or
tropic
zones
from
the
openness
of
its
expression
however
too
much
case
should
not
be
made
as
we
really
know
but
little
of
how
an
planet
would
look
we
find
no
difficulty
in
seeing
objects
a
hundred
miles
away
across
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
yet
the
thickness
of
the
air
strata
in
such
horizontal
traversing
is
many
fold
what
it
is
when
we
look
directly
up
it
is
also
out
of
all
proportion
laden
with
dust
and
smoke
in
the
purer
regions
of
the
earth
a
clear
air
imposes
but
little
bar
to
sight
and
conjures
up
far
things
startlingly
distinct
nevertheless
every
evidence
points
to
a
thin
air
upon
mars
reasoning
indirect
deduction
and
direct
sight
now
from
a
thinness
of
atmosphere
it
would
follow
other
things
equal
that
the
climate
was
cold
about
this
there
has
been
much
question
but
less
of
answering
reply
from
the
distance
of
the
planet
from
the
sun
it
is
certain
less
heat
is
received
by
it
than
falls
upon
the
earth
in
something
like
the
ratio
of
one
to
two
but
that
the
amount
effective
is
as
the
amount
received
is
far
from
sure
the
available
heat
is
much
affected
by
the
manner
of
its
reception
a
blanket
of
air
acts
like
the
glass
of
a
conservatory
letting
the
light
rays
in
but
hindering
the
heat
rays
out
the
light
rays
falling
on
the
ground
or
the
air
are
transformed
into
heat
rays
that
finding
the
return
journey
less
easy
are
consequently
trapped
all
substances
are
thus
calorifiers
but
water
vapor
is
many
times
more
potent
than
ordinary
air
to
a
humid
air
has
a
hothouse
tang
to
it
most
perceptible
now
what
the
relative
percentage
of
water
vapor
in
the
martian
atmosphere
may
be
we
do
not
know
the
thinness
of
the
martian
air
has
caused
it
to
be
likened
to
that
upon
our
highest
mountain
peaks
which
are
in
large
part
covered
with
perpetual
snow
but
the
comparison
is
not
well
founded
a
peak
differs
materially
from
a
plateau
in
the
countenance
it
gives
to
the
heat
falling
upon
it
on
a
plateau
each
warmed
acre
of
ground
helps
the
retention
of
heat
by
its
neighbor
while
in
addition
to
being
destitute
of
side
support
the
higher
winds
generated
about
an
isolated
peak
blow
its
own
caloric
away
still
less
does
any
analogy
hold
between
the
two
when
the
plateau
is
a
one
from
these
considerations
it
is
evident
glosses
are
possible
upon
the
bald
idea
of
a
much
lower
temperature
prevailing
on
the
martian
surface
than
on
the
earth
s
doubtless
the
theoretic
cold
has
been
greatly
overdone
reversely
recent
observations
tend
to
lower
the
apparent
temperature
disclosed
by
the
features
of
the
disk
and
between
the
rising
of
the
theoretic
and
the
falling
of
the
observed
we
are
left
with
a
very
reasonable
compromise
and
reconcilement
as
the
result
the
various
look
and
behavior
of
the
surface
of
mars
point
to
a
mean
temperature
colder
than
that
of
the
earth
but
above
the
of
water
for
regions
at
least
outside
of
the
polar
caps
and
during
all
but
the
winter
months
except
at
certain
special
spots
and
possibly
even
there
frost
is
unknown
at
all
times
within
the
tropics
and
except
in
winter
in
temperate
latitudes
these
anomalous
localities
mentioned
in
the
preceding
chapter
may
be
said
to
be
the
exceptions
that
prove
the
rule
of
general
for
if
they
be
snow
they
stand
witness
to
its
absence
elsewhere
upon
the
disk
and
if
they
are
not
they
testify
the
more
emphatically
to
the
same
effect
as
between
different
parts
of
the
surface
the
tilt
of
the
martian
axis
and
the
greater
length
of
the
martian
seasons
the
one
the
same
as
the
other
the
double
of
our
own
tend
to
an
accentuation
of
the
heat
in
the
temperate
and
arctic
or
antarctic
zones
the
greatest
insolation
on
earth
is
not
as
we
might
suppose
at
the
equator
but
at
the
parallels
of
north
and
south
even
the
poles
themselves
receiving
a
quarter
as
much
heat
again
on
midsummer
day
as
ever
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
line
this
broad
physical
fact
is
equally
true
of
mars
while
in
the
matter
of
consecutive
exposure
mars
in
summer
outdoes
the
earth
for
the
longer
the
seasons
the
more
nearly
does
the
effective
heat
approach
the
received
amount
thus
both
on
the
score
of
heat
received
and
of
heat
husbanded
these
zones
must
be
relatively
warm
and
this
shows
itself
in
the
look
of
the
surface
in
summer
it
is
clearly
warmer
within
the
polar
regions
than
is
the
case
on
earth
to
judge
by
the
effect
in
winter
the
cold
is
doubtless
proportionately
severe
for
the
diurnal
range
of
temperature
we
have
less
data
there
is
evidence
pointing
to
chilly
nights
but
it
is
meagre
and
we
are
left
to
fall
back
on
the
cold
of
our
deserts
at
night
for
analogic
condition
of
the
state
of
things
over
the
martian
desert
levels
after
the
sun
goes
down
if
we
are
uncertain
of
the
precise
character
of
the
martian
climate
we
know
on
the
other
hand
a
good
deal
about
the
martian
weather
a
pleasing
absence
of
it
over
much
of
the
planet
distinguishes
martian
conditions
from
our
own
that
we
can
scan
the
surface
as
we
do
without
practical
interruption
day
in
and
day
out
proves
the
weather
over
it
to
be
permanently
fair
in
fact
a
clear
sky
except
in
winter
and
in
many
places
even
then
is
not
only
the
rule
but
the
rule
almost
without
exceptions
in
the
early
days
of
martian
study
cases
of
obscuration
were
recorded
from
time
to
time
by
observers
in
which
portions
of
the
disk
were
changed
or
hidden
as
if
clouds
were
veiling
them
from
view
more
modern
observations
fail
to
support
this
deduction
partly
by
absence
of
instances
partly
by
other
explanation
of
the
facts
certainly
the
recorded
instances
are
very
rare
indeed
occasions
of
the
sort
must
to
any
martians
be
events
since
only
one
possible
example
has
presented
itself
to
me
during
the
course
of
my
observations
extending
more
or
less
over
eleven
years
even
in
this
case
there
was
no
obliteration
though
a
certain
whiteness
overspread
an
area
near
the
equator
temporarily
position
seemed
to
point
to
its
identity
with
a
cloud
which
made
its
appearance
about
that
time
upon
the
terminator
and
lasted
for
some
hours
the
cloud
however
showed
evidence
of
being
not
the
kind
with
which
we
are
familiar
but
a
in
keeping
indeed
with
the
desert
region
chryse
in
which
it
originated
with
the
exception
of
sporadic
disturbance
of
the
sort
the
whole
surface
of
the
planet
outside
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
polar
caps
seems
free
from
cloud
or
mist
and
to
lie
perpetually
unveiled
to
space
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
caps
however
and
especially
round
about
their
edge
a
very
distinct
pearly
appearance
is
presented
during
the
months
at
which
the
cap
is
at
its
maximum
or
in
other
words
in
the
depth
of
its
winter
of
a
dull
white
hue
and
indefinite
contour
the
phenomenon
suggests
cloud
where
it
lies
spread
no
markings
are
visible
an
absence
explicable
by
obscuration
due
an
interposed
medium
but
equally
well
by
seasonal
of
the
markings
themselves
which
from
the
general
behavior
of
these
markings
we
know
to
be
to
some
extent
certainly
the
fact
of
the
regions
where
the
effect
is
noticeable
hellas
is
the
most
striking
so
conspicuously
white
during
the
winter
of
the
southern
hemisphere
as
to
have
been
often
mistaken
for
the
polar
cap
its
ghost
shows
thus
almost
regularly
every
martian
year
what
is
as
suggestive
as
it
is
striking
the
blanching
is
confined
to
the
solid
circle
constituting
hellas
and
does
not
extend
into
the
dark
regions
by
which
it
is
circumscribed
hellas
is
as
when
thus
powdered
as
when
in
its
normal
ochre
or
abnormal
red
it
stretches
like
a
broad
buckler
across
the
body
of
the
disk
that
the
land
there
lies
at
a
higher
level
than
its
surroundings
is
pretty
certain
but
that
the
difference
can
amount
to
enough
to
explain
its
silveriness
as
ice
is
improbable
in
latitude
hellas
is
distinctly
temperate
lying
between
the
parallels
of
and
but
on
mars
this
is
no
warrant
of
a
like
climate
again
though
close
on
the
south
to
what
constitutes
the
polar
cap
it
does
not
strictly
form
part
of
that
cap
but
occupies
both
in
position
and
in
kind
a
something
intermediary
between
the
regions
of
periodic
snow
and
the
warmer
ones
of
perpetual
sunshine
it
seems
to
be
afflicted
with
the
winter
weather
of
the
north
of
europe
and
to
owe
its
pearly
look
at
such
times
to
the
same
cloud
canopy
that
then
distressingly
covers
those
inclement
lands
similar
in
behavior
to
it
is
the
long
chain
of
islands
that
beginning
southwest
of
thaumasia
runs
thence
westward
even
to
the
eastern
edge
of
hellas
these
belt
the
planet
in
a
direction
by
a
strip
of
territory
from
ten
to
fifteen
degrees
wide
the
medial
line
of
which
begins
at
south
and
ends
in
about
they
are
parted
from
the
main
bright
areas
by
seas
of
about
the
same
width
as
themselves
the
mare
sirenum
the
mare
cimmerium
and
mare
tyrrhenum
these
seas
the
white
that
covers
the
islands
never
crosses
though
the
continent
as
we
may
call
it
for
convenience
descends
at
the
east
to
south
since
the
seas
are
not
seas
the
cause
which
might
bound
the

can
not

here

they
have
an
effect

is

not
only
by
latitudinal
comparison
with
the
state
of
things
in
hellas
but
with
that
in
thaumasia
as
well
for
south
is
also
the
limit
apparently
of
the
white
on
thaumasia
where
ochre
desert
stretches
ten
degrees
farther
south
still
the
region
in
its
southern
part
being
in
its
northern
part
not
here
again
then
the
ochre
areas
make
exception
to
what
affects
the
ones
clearly
the
regions
temper
the
action
of
what
gives
them
wintry
cloak
but
why
they
should
do
this
is
not
easy
to
explain
on
any
supposition
terrestrial
or
marine
bodies
of
water
tend
to
foster
the
formation
of
clouds
so
less
markedly
do
areas
of
vegetation
neither
the
old
ideas
then
nor
the
new
lend
themselves
in
explanation
it
may
be
that
while
we
here
seem
to
be
envisaging
cloud
we
are
in
reality
looking
at
on
the
other
hand
light
cloud
would
show
less
superposed
over
a
dark
background
than
over
an
ochre
one
and
this
the
simplest
of
all
explanations
may
be
the
true
one
it
is
facts
like
these
that
intrigue
us
in
the
study
of
the
martian
surface
by
revealing
conditions
which
render
offhand
analogy
with
the
earth
unsafe
indeed
we
are
more
sure
of
some
things
which
appear
too
strange
to
be
true
than
of
others
so
simple
on
their
face
as
to
enlist
belief
among
the
most
difficult
and
perplexing
are
meteorological
problems
like
the
above
here
we
can
only
say
provisionally
that
while
cloud
best
answers
to
the
appearance
frost
best
fits
the
cause
for
vegetation
might
melt
frost
yet
not
dissipate
cloud
by
raising
our
conception
of
the
mean
temperature
the
facts
can
however
be
reconciled
and
this
is
probably
the
solution
of
the
difficulty
after
all
as
we
saw
in
the
annual
history
of
the
polar
caps
a
dimness
somewhat
different
affects
the
northern
cap
in
may
and
june
after
the
melting
of
the
cap
is
well
under
way
a
haziness
sets
in
along
its
edge
which
befuddles
its
outline
and
effectually
hides
what
is
going
on
within
it
when
at
last
the
screen
clears
away
the
cap
is
found
to
be
reduced
to
its
least
dimensions
such
obstructing
sheet
looks
to
be
more
of
the
nature
of
mist
caused
by
the
excessive
melting
of
the
cap
unfortunately
there
are
here
no
patches
of
to
test
a
possible
partiality
in
its
behavior
over
such
tracts
nor
has
similar
action
ever
yet
been
remarked
in
the
case
of
the
cap
of
the
southern
hemisphere
regular
recurrence
at
the
appropriate
season
of
the
planet
s
year
together
with
extensive
action
at
the
time
takes
this
springtide
mist
to
some
extent
out
of
the
domain
of
weather
into
that
of
climate
for
it
prevails
all
round
the
cap
and
repeats
itself
in
place
as
each
fresh
spring
comes
on
at
least
it
has
done
so
for
the
past
three
oppositions
at
which
it
has
been
possible
to
observe
well
the
arctic
zones
it
is
thus
both
general
in
its
application
and
fixed
in
its
behavior
nevertheless
it
betrays
something
of
the
fickleness
which
characterizes
that
more
inconstant
thing
weather
for
it
comes
and
goes
one
thinks
for
good
only
to
find
it
there
again
some
days
later
not
less
captious
is
the
meteorologic
action
shown
in
the
making
of
the
new
polar
cap
when
the
northern
one
starts
to
form
vast
areas
of
frost
are
deposited
in
a
single
night
these
however
are
not
permanent
the
ground
thus
covered
is
during
the
next
few
days
again
partially
laid
bare
then
a
new
fall
occurs
hiding
the
surface
a
little
more
completely
than
before
and
the
lost
domain
is
more
than
regained
by
such
wavelike
advance
and
recession
the
tide
of
frost
creeps
over
and
submerges
the
arctic
regions
as
the
late
summer
passes
into
the
autumn
in
this
alternate
coming
and
going
with
succeeding
days
we
have
an
unsteadfastness
of
action
most
fittingly
paralleled
by
our
own
weather
it
would
seem
that
local
causes
there
as
here
are
superposed
upon
the
orderly
progress
of
the
seasons
and
though
at
the
of
the
autumn
the
cold
is
steadily
gathering
strength
nevertheless
warm
days
occur
now
and
then
to
stay
its
hand
only
to
be
succeeded
in
their
turn
by
frosts
more
biting
than
before
even
on
mars
nothing
in
the
way
of
weather
is
absolutely
predicable
but
impredicability
chapter
ix
mountains
and
cloud
in
all
ways
but
one
our
scrutiny
of
the
planet
is
confined
to
such
view
as
we
might
get
of
it
from
the
car
of
a
balloon
poised
above
it
in
space
from
which
we
should
see
the
surface
only
as
a
map
spread
out
below
us
a
matter
of
but
two
dimensions
the
exception
consists
in
the
observation
of
what
are
called
projections
irregularities
visible
when
the
disk
is
gibbous
upon
that
edge
of
the
planet
where
the
light
fades
off
striking
phenomena
in
themselves
they
are
of
particular
value
for
what
may
be
deduced
from
them
for
by
them
we
are
afforded
our
only
opportunity
of
gaining
knowledge
of
the
surface
other
than
in
plan
and
thus
of
determining
between
peak
plateau
or
plain
that
to
a
bird
view
alike
lie
flattened
out
to
one
dead
level
it
might
at
first
be
thought
that
our
best
chance
of
noting
any
elevations
or
depressions
of
the
martian
surface
lay
in
catching
that
surface
in
profile
by
scanning
the
bright
edge
of
it
which
stands
against
the
sky
and
is
called
the
limb
for
this
is
practically
what
we
do
on
earth
when
we
mark
a
mountain
against
the
horizon
and
measure
its
height
by
triangulation
unfortunately
the
method
fails
in
the
case
of
mars
because
of
the
great
distance
we
are
away
unless
the
planet
were
distinctly
more
generously
equipped
than
the
earth
in
the
matter
of
mountains
nothing
could
be
hoped
from
so
forthright
an
envisaging
so
relatively
insignificant
to
the
size
of
its
globe
is
the
relief
of
the
earth
s
surface
that
an
orange
skin
would
seem
grossly
rough
by
comparison
the
same
proves
true
for
mars
with
the
greatest
magnification
we
can
produce
the
martian
limb
still
appears
perfectly
smooth
luckily
while
direct
vision
is
thus
impossible
oblique
illumination
enables
us
to
get
an
insight
into
the
character
of
the
surface
we
had
otherwise
been
denied
when
mountains
or
valleys
chance
to
lie
upon
the
boundary
of
light
and
darkness
the
rim
of
the
disk
known
as
the
terminator
in
contradistinction
to
the
limb
where
the
surface
itself
comes
to
an
end
they
make
their
presence
evident
through
an
indirect
species
of
magnification
the
elongate
effect
of
oblique
lighting
with
a
practical
instance
of
it
every
one
is
familiar
who
has
walked
by
night
along
a
road
imperfectly
starred
at
intervals
by
electric
lights
startled
between
posts
by
what
seemed
deep
holes
and
high
furrows
he
has
involuntarily
imitated
a
spavined
horse
for
fear
of
stubbing
his
toes
only
to
encounter
when
his
foot
fell
a
surface
on
contact
surprisingly
smooth
the
slant
illumination
by
lengthening
the
shadows
had
painfully
deceived
him
into
exaggerated
inference
of
irregularity
what
proves
disturbing
to
a
wayfarer
misguided
by
arc
lights
is
made
to
do
the
eye
service
when
it
comes
to
planetary
interpretation
on
the
boundary
of
light
and
shade
those
parts
of
the
surface
where
it
is
sunrise
or
sunset
upon
the
planet
the
sun
s
rays
fall
so
athwartwise
as
to
throw
enormous
shadows
from
quite
small
elevations
to
an
eye
so
placed
as
to
view
the
surface
with
anything
approaching
perpendicularity
a
mountain
mass
there
will
thus
proclaim
itself
by
protracted
profile
upon
the
plain
in
hundredfold
magnification
similarly
a
peak
there
will
advertise
its
height
by
catching
the
coming
or
holding
the
lingering
light
at
many
times
the
distance
of
its
own
elevation
away
from
the
night
side
of
the
planet
here
if
anywhere
then
could
mountains
be
expected
to
disclose
themselves
and
here
when
existent
they
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
been
found
our
own
moon
offers
us
the
first
and
easiest
example
of
such
vicariously
visible
relief
when
the
moon
is
near
the
quarter
and
for
three
or
four
days
on
either
side
of
that
a
keen
eye
can
usually
detect
one
or
more
knobs
like
warts
projecting
from
its
terminator
easily
distinguished
from
the
limb
both
by
reason
of
being
less
bright
and
of
being
bounded
by
a
instead
of
a
semicircle
if
a
telescope
or
even
an
be
substituted
for
the
eye
it
is
possible
to
see
what
causes
them
the
knob
resolves
itself
into
the
illuminated
rim
of
a
crater
separated
from
the
main
body
of
the
visible
moon
by
the
seemingly
black
void
of
space
the
peak
has
caught
the
sunlight
while
its
foot
and
the
country
between
it
and
the
illuminated
surface
still
lies
shrouded
in
shadow
from
measurement
of
the
distance
the
peak
seems
to
stand
aloof
from
the
line
where
the
plain
itself
is
touched
by
the
light
the
height
of
it
above
that
plain
may
be
calculated
in
this
way
have
been
found
the
heights
of
the
mountains
of
the
moon
incidentally
brain
outstrips
brawn
for
pinnacles
no
lunarian
could
scale
both
for
their
precipitous
inaccessibility
and
their
loftiness
man
has
measured
without
so
much
as
setting
foot
upon
their
globe
at
each
lunar
sunrise
and
again
at
lunar
sunset
these
old
crater
walls
show
their
crescent
coronets
tipped
the
reverse
way
and
peaks
higher
than
the
himalayas
make
gigantic
gnomons
of
themselves
with
hands
outstretched
to
grasp
the
plains
in
this
manner
a
lunar
peak
of
fifteen
thousand
feet
shows
its
presence
to
the
unaided
eye
with
so
much
for
we
can
calculate
how
low
an
elevation
could
similarly
be
made
out
on
mars
under
a
like
phase
illumination
now
in
spheres
of
different
diameters
the
distance
out
from
the
terminator
for
a
given
height
is
as
the
square
root
of
the
diameter
mars
has
about
twice
the
size
of
the
moon
in
consequence
if
we
saw
the
planet
at
the
same
distance
off
as
the
moon
the
height
of
a
peak
upon
it
sufficient
to
cast
an
equal
shadow
or
be
seen
at
an
equal
separation
from
the
terminator
need
be
but
two
thirds
as
high
to
see
it
thus
equidistant
a
power
of
or
is
necessary
dependent
on
the
opposition
twice
this
power
may
at
times
be
used
and
by
the
same
reasoning
this
would
reduce
the
height
sufficient
to
show
by
four
or
to
something
like
feet
this
then
would
be
the
theoretic
limit
of
the
visible
a
limit
needing
to
be
somewhat
increased
because
of
the
imperfection
of
our
air
having
found
thus
what
should
be
visible
on
mars
we
turn
now
to
see
what
is
at
once
we
find
ourselves
confronted
with
a
very
unlunar
state
of
things
common
upon
the
face
of
the
moon
excrescences
of
the
terminator
are
rare
on
mars
the
first
ever
seen
was
detected
by
a
visitor
at
the
lick
observatory
in
since
then
they
have
been
repeatedly
noticed
both
at
the
lick
and
elsewhere
but
although
observers
are
now
on
the
watch
for
them
they
are
not
very
frequently
chronicled
because
not
of
everyday
occurrence
much
depends
upon
the
opposition
some
approaches
of
the
planet
proving
more
prolific
of
them
than
others
how
rare
they
are
however
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
the
last
three
oppositions
have
disclosed
but
one
apiece
an
account
of
the
great
projection
of
may
will
give
an
idea
of
the
extent
and
interest
of
the
phenomenon
and
will
serve
to
show
to
what
cause
we
must
attribute
all
such
that
have
been
visible
on
mars
for
the
behavior
of
this
one
was
typical
of
the
class
illustration
projection
on
terminator
about
half
past
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
of
may
slipher
astronomer
at
flagstaff
shortly
after
taking
over
the
telescope
then
directed
upon
mars
suddenly
noticed
a
large
projection
about
halfway
up
the
terminator
of
the
planet
he
at
once
sent
word
of
the
fact
and
the
observatory
staff
turned
out
to
see
it
for
a
projection
has
for
workers
on
mars
the
like
interest
that
a
new
comet
possesses
for
astronomers
generally
in
this
case
the
phenomenon
was
specially
potent
in
that
it
was
the
first
to
be
detected
that
year
its
singularity
was
amply
seconded
by
its
size
for
it
was
very
large
its
extent
both
in
length
and
height
being
excessive
when
i
first
saw
it
the
projection
consisted
of
an
oval
patch
of
light
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
centre
of
the
phase
ellipse
lying
parallel
to
the
terminator
but
parted
from
it
by
darkness
to
the
extent
of
half
the
projection
s
own
width
it
made
thus
not
simply
an
excrescence
but
a
detached
islet
of
light
it
was
easily
seen
by
all
those
present
and
was
carefully
studied
from
that
time
on
by
slipher
and
me
both
of
us
made
drawings
of
it
alternately
at
intervals
as
well
as
micrometer
measures
of
its
position
next
to
its
great
size
the
most
striking
feature
about
it
was
its
color
this
instead
of
being
white
or
whitish
was
ochre
orange
a
hue
closely
assimilated
to
the
tint
of
the
subjacent
parts
of
the
disk
which
was
the
region
known
as
chryse
this
distinctive
complexion
it
kept
throughout
the
period
of
its
apparition
at
the
same
time
baltia
a
region
to
the
north
of
it
and
synchronously
visible
close
upon
the
terminator
showed
whitish
the
seeing
was
good
enough
to
disclose
the
phison
and
euphrates
double
the
power
a
magnification
of
and
the
aperture
the
full
aperture
of
the
objective
from
the
time
it
was
first
seen
the
detached
patch
of
light
crept
in
toward
the
disk
the
illuminated
body
of
the
planet
four
minutes
after
i
noted
it
the
dark
space
separating
it
from
the
nearest
point
of
the
terminator
had
sensibly
lessened
so
it
continued
with
some
fluctuations
intrinsic
to
the
atmospheric
difficulties
of
observations
generally
and
to
the
smallness
of
the
object
itself
to
become
gradually
less
and
less
salient
it
lasted
for
about
forty
minutes
from
the
moment
it
had
first
appeared
to
slipher
and
then
passed
from
sight
to
leave
the
edge
of
the
planet
smooth
and
commonplace
again
the
measures
made
on
it
showed
that
it
lay
when
first
seen
in
longitude
latitude
north
and
that
its
highest
point
stood
seventeen
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
planet
it
was
three
hundred
miles
long
these
are
my
own
figures
from
which
slipher
s
do
not
substantially
differ
the
return
of
the
part
of
the
planet
where
it
had
been
seen
was
eagerly
awaited
the
night
after
by
both
observers
to
see
if
it
would
bring
the
projection
with
it
for
only
once
a
day
is
the
same
region
of
mars
similarly
presented
but
in
order
not
to
miss
the
projection
should
it
be
ahead
of
time
observations
were
begun
before
it
was
due
shortly
after
they
were
started
there
appeared
higher
up
the
terminator
and
therefore
farther
north
than
had
been
the
case
the
night
before
a
small
projection
it
was
with
difficulty
made
out
and
its
position
measured
without
careful
watching
it
must
have
been
missed
altogether
as
it
was
it
differed
in
every
respect
from
that
of
the
preceding
day
it
was
not
nearly
so
high
not
nearly
so
large
and
lay
in
a
different
place
on
the
planet
being
now
in
longitude
latitude
either
the
two
therefore
were
totally
different
things
or
the
projection
had
moved
in
the
elapsed
interval
of
time
over
seven
degrees
of
latitude
and
eight
degrees
of
longitude
a
distance
of
three
hundred
and
ninety
miles
in
hours
where
the
previous
projection
had
been
nothing
showed
on
the
following
night
may
no
trace
of
anything
unusual
could
be
seen
anywhere
we
are
now
concerned
to
inquire
to
what
this
series
of
appearances
could
have
been
due
the
first
observers
of
projections
on
mars
had
unhesitatingly
attributed
them
to
the
same
cause
that
produces
projections
on
the
moon
to
wit
mountains
such
they
were
held
to
be
in
france
and
at
the
lick
this
view
however
was
in
disputed
by
pickering
who
considered
them
to
be
not
mountains
but
cloud
and
this
view
was
strongly
supported
by
douglass
in
a
discussion
of
a
large
number
of
them
observed
in
at
flagstaff
the
mountain
theory
of
their
generation
was
finally
shown
to
be
untenable
and
their
ascription
to
cloud
conclusively
proved
to
be
the
correct
solution
by
the
observations
of
a
remarkable
one
made
in
december
and
the
careful
study
to
which
by
the
writer
they
were
subjected
we
shall
now
explain
how
this
was
done
and
we
will
begin
by
pointing
out
that
the
fact
that
only
a
single
specimen
of
the
phenomenon
was
visible
at
each
of
the
three
oppositions
of
and
was
itself
conclusive
rightly
viewed
of
their
character
this
conclusion
follows
at
once
from
the
isolateness
of
the
phenomenon
for
a
mountain
can
not
change
its
place
now
the
shift
in
the
aspect
presented
by
the
planet
s
disk
from
one
night
to
the
next
is
not
sufficient
to
alter
perceptibly
the
appearance
shown
by
anything
upon
its
edge
on
the
two
occasions
if
then
a
peak
stood
out
upon
it
one
evening
the
peak
should
again
show
salient
when
the
region
reached
the
same
position
upon
the
succeeding
night
that
nothing
then
was
seen
where
something
had
previously
been
visible
proved
the
phenomenon
not
that
of
a
mountain
peak
since
what
produced
the
projection
was
clearly
not
fixed
in
place
and
therefore
not
attached
to
the
soil
now
the
only
other
thing
capable
of
catching
the
light
before
it
reached
the
surface
would
be
something
suspended
in
the
air
that
is
a
cloud
deduction
therefore
from
the
rarity
of
the
phenomenon
alone
showed
that
the
projections
must
be
clouds
their
behavior
in
detail
entirely
corroborates
this
deduction
from
their
intermittence
such
was
shown
by
the
action
of
the
projection
of
december
as
set
forth
in
a
paper
before
the
american
philosophical
society
and
such
again
by
that
of
the
one
of
may
as
we
shall
now
note
to
begin
with
we
notice
that
the
projection
seen
on
may
was
not
found
either
or
in
size
on
may
and
had
wholly
vanished
on
may
though
the
seeing
was
substantially
the
same
if
not
better
on
the
two
nights
succeeding
that
of
its
original
detection
hence
in
its
own
instance
this
projection
proved
an
alibi
irreconcilable
with
the
character
of
a
mountain
mass
but
it
did
more
it
not
only
was
not
on
the
second
evening
what
and
where
it
had
been
on
the
first
but
the
remains
of
it
visible
on
the
second
occasion
showed
clearly
that
it
had
moved
in
the
meantime
furthermore
it
was
disappearing
as
it
went
for
it
was
very
much
smaller
after
the
lapse
of
hours
the
something
that
caused
it
was
not
only
not
attached
to
the
soil
but
was
moving
and
dissipating
as
it
moved
only
one
class
of
bodies
known
to
us
can
account
for
these
metamorphoses
and
that
is
cloud
but
what
kind
of
cloud
are
we
to
conceive
it
to
be
our
ordinary
vapor
clouds
are
whitish
and
this
would
be
still
more
their
color
could
they
be
looked
at
from
above
the
martian
cloud
was
not
white
but
tawny
of
the
tint
exhibited
by
a
cloud
of
dust
nor
could
this
color
have
very
well
been
lent
it
by
its
sunrise
position
for
other
places
equally
situated
to
be
tinged
by
the
hues
of
that
time
of
day
baltia
to
wit
showed
distinctly
white
so
that
we
must
suppose
it
to
be
what
it
looked
a
something
of
the
soil
not
beholden
to
atmospheric
tinting
for
its
hue
a
vast
traveling
slowly
over
the
desert
and
settling
slowly
again
to
the
ground
precisely
the
same
general
course
of
drifting
disappearance
was
taken
by
the
projection
of
december
and
and
this
too
stood
an
unique
apparition
in
the
annals
of
its
opposition
clouds
then
and
not
mountains
are
the
explanation
of
the
projections
on
mars
differing
thus
completely
from
the
lunar
ones

to

indeed
the
initial

of

on
noting
that
the

changed
its

he
inferred
a
turning
of
the

in

hours
thirteen
years
later

this

with

again
after
eleven
more
years
he
depicted
it
for
the
third
time
and
now
so
changed
because
of
the
different
tilt
of
the
planet
toward
the

that
it
may
be
doubted
whether

recognized

over

the

as

later
came
to
be
recognized
as
possessing

at
a
complete
geography
in
and
out
through
the

was
traced
the

commonly
in
long
mediterraneans
of
shade
but
here
and
there
in
isolated
caspians
of
color
with
our
modern
telescopic
means
the
dark
patches
are
easily
visible
the
very
smallest
glass
sufficing
to
disclose
them
when
thus
shown
they
much
resemble
in
contour
the
dark
patches
on
the
face
of
the
moon
as
seen
with
the
naked
eye
now
these
patches
were
early
taken
for
lunar
seas
and
received
names
in
keeping
with
the
conception
as
the
sea
of
serenity
the
sea
of
vapors
and
so
forth
following
the
recognition
of
a
like
appearance
like
appellatives
were
given
to
the
martian
markings
and
the
mare

or
sea
of
the
sirens
the
mare
cimmerium
and
others
sufficiently
proclaim
what
was
thought
of
them
at
the
time
they
were
thus
baptized
indeed
if
a
general
similarity
be
any
warrant
for
a
generic
name
they
were
not
at
the
time
for
common
to
all
three
bodies
the
earth
the
moon
and
the
planet
mars
is
the
figuration
of
their
surfaces
into
light
areas
and
dark
in
the
martian
disk
as
in
the
lunar
one
we
seem
to
be
looking
at
a
cartographic
presentation
of
some
strange
geography
suspended
in
the
sky
the
first
generic
difference
between
the
two
being
that
the
chart
is
done
in
chiaroscuro
for
the
moon
in
color
for
mars
on
mundane
maps
we
know
the
dusky
washes
for
oceans
so
on
the
moon
it
was
only
natural
to
consider
their
counterparts
as
and
on
mars
as
nor
did
the
hue
of
the
martian
ones
detract
from
the
resemblance
but
in
something
other
than
color
these
markings
are
alike
in
fact
color
could
hardly
be
excuse
for
considering
the
lunar
what
their
name
implies
for
distinctive
tint
is
lacking
in
them
even
to
the
naked
eye
it
was
in
form
that
the
likeness
lay
their
figures
were
such
as
our
own
oceans
show
and
allowing
for
a
sisterly
contrast
amid
a
sisterly
resemblance
the
lunar
or
the
martian
seas
might
well
have
been
of
similar
origin
to
those
with
which
our
schoolboy
study
of
atlases
had
made
us
familiar
thus
did
similarity
in
look
suggest
similarity
in
origin
and
intuitive
recognition
clothe
its
objects
with
the
same
specific
name
considerable
assumption
however
underlay
the
pleasing
simplicity
of
the
correlation
on
other
grounds
consequent
not
so
much
upon
any
lack
of
astronomic
knowledge
as
curiously
upon
a
dearth
of
knowledge
of
ourselves
we
know
how
other
bodies
look
to
us
but
we
ignore
how
we
look
to
them
it
is
not
so
easy
to
see
ourselves
as
others
see
us
for
a
far
view
may
differ
from
a
near
one
and
a
matter
of
inclination
greatly
alter
the
result
owing
both
to
distance
and
to
tilt
we
lack
that
practical
acquaintance
with
the
aspect
of
our
own
oceans
viewed
from
above
necessary
to
definite
predication
of
their
appearance
across
interplanetary
space
our
usual
idea
is
that
seas
show
dark
but
it
is
also
quite
evident
that
under
some
circumstances
they
appear
the
contrary
it
all
depends
upon
the
position
of
the
observer
and
upon
the
position
of
the
sun
their
usual
ultramarine
may
become
even
as
molten
brass
from
indirect
reflection
while
on
direct
mirroring
they
give
back
the
sun
with
such
scarce
perceptible
purloining
of
splendor
as
to
present
a
dazzling
sheen
not
to
be
gazed
upon
without
regret
canopied
by
a
welkin
they
assume
its
leaden
hue
while
at
the
same
time
their
shores
less
impressionable
to
borrowed
lighting
show
several
tints
darker
than
themselves
surfaces
so
sensitive
to
illumination
hardly
admit
of
more
accusable
tint
than
a
chameleon
nevertheless
we
are
probably
justified
in
our
conviction
that
perpendicularly
visaged
they
would
on
the
whole
outdo
in
sombreness
land
round
about
them
and
so
be
evident
as
dusky
patches
against
a
brighter
ground
one
phenomenon
we
might
with
some
confidence
look
to
see
exhibited
by
them
were
they
oceans
and
that
is
the
reflected
image
of
the
sun
visible
as
a
burnished
glare
at
a
calculable
point
specular
reflection
of
the
sort
was
early
suggested
in
the
case
of
mars
and
physical
ephemerides
for
the
planet
registered
for
many
years
the
precise
spot
where
the
starlike
image
should
be
sought
but
it
was
never
seen
yet
not
till
the
marine
character
of
the
martian
seas
had
been
otherwise
disproved
was
the
futile
quest
for
it
abandoned
indeed
it
was
a
tacit
recognition
that
our
knowledge
had
advanced
when
this
column
in
the
ephemeris
was
allowed
to
lapse
on
this
general
marine
ascription
doubt
was
first
cast
in
the
case
of
the
moon
so
soon
as
the
telescope
came
to
be
pointed
at
our
satellite
it
was
evident
that
the
darker
washes
were
not
water
surfaces
at
all
but
very
palpably
plains
long
low
ridges
of
elevation
stood
out
upon
them
like
prairie
swells
which
grew
in
visible
relief
according
to
the
slanting
character
of
the
illumination
cracks
or
rills
too
appeared
near
their
edges
and
craters
showed
in
their
very
midst
patently
solid
they
betrayed
their
constitution
not
only
by
diverse
topography
but
by
diversified
tint
all
manner
of
shades
of
neutral
tone
mottled
their
surface
from
seeming
porphyry
to
chalk
belief
perforce
departed
when
the
telescope
thus
pricked
the
bubble
evaporating
as
the
water
itself
had
done
long
before
so
much
was
known
before
the
mars
markings
were
named
nevertheless
humanity
true
to
its
instincts
promptly
proceeded
to
commit
again
the
same
mistake
and
cheerfully
undeterred
by
the
exposure
of
its
errors
in
the
case
of
the
moon
repeated
the
christening
in
the
case
of
mars
so
sure
was
it
of
its
ground
that
what
it
saw
was
not
ground
that
though
the
particular
appellatives
of
the
several
seas
were
constantly
altered
rebaptisms
while
changing
the
personal
kept
the
generic
name
dawes
ocean
for
example
later
became
l
ocean
newton
and
later
still
the
mare
erythraeum
but
remained
set
down
as
much
a
sea
as
before
about
thirteen
years
ago
however
what
had
befallen
the
seas
of
the
moon
befell
those
of
mars
the
loss
of
their
character
it
was
first
recognized
through
a
similar
exposure
but
the
fact
was
led
up
to
and
might
have
been
realized
in
consequence
of
quite
a
different
line
of
evidence
the
initial
thing
to
cast
doubt
upon
the
seas
being
what
they
seemed
to
be
was
the
detection
of
change
in
their
aspect
that
the
detection
was
not
made
much
earlier
than
actually
happened
shows
how
a
phenomenon
may
elude
observation
if
scrutiny
be
not
persistent
and
its
results
from
time
to
time
not
carefully
compared
schiaparelli
was
the
one
who
first
noticed
variation
in
the
look
of
the
seas
and
the
discovery
was
as
much
due
to
the
assiduity
with
which
he
followed
the
planet
opposition
after
opposition
as
to
the
keenness
with
which
he
scanned
it
the
noting
of
change
in
the
areas
constituted
in
fact
one
of
the
first
fruits
of
systematic
study
of
the
planet
change
in
configuration
that
is
alteration
of
area
preceded
in
recognition
alteration
of
tint
thus
the
syrtis
major
showed
larger
to
him
in
than
it
had
in
this
was
natural
difference
of
degree
being
a
more
delicate
matter
to
perceive
than
its
effect
upon
extent
from
change
of
area
his
perception
went
on
to
change
of
tone
in
his
own
words
what
he
noticed
was
this
vi
no
less
certain
is
it
that
from
one
opposition
to
another
one
notices
in
the
seas
very
remarkable
alterations
of
tone
thus
the
regions
called
mare
cimmerium
mare
sirenum
and
solis
lacus
which
during
the
years
to
could
be
numbered
among
the
most
sombre
on
the
planet
during
the
succeeding
oppositions
became
less
and
less
black
and
in
were
of
a
light
gray
hardly
sufficient
to
render
them
visible
in
the
oblique
position
in
which
all
three
found
themselves
on
the
other
hand
at
the
very
same
moment
the
mare
acidalium
and
the
lacus
hyperboreus
showed
very
dark
the
latter
indeed
appeared
nearly
black
although
seen
as
tilted
as
the
syrtis
and
the
equatorial
bays
the
condition
of
the
regions
called
seas
is
therefore
not
constant
so
much
is
unquestionable
perhaps
the
change
produced
in
them
has
to
do
with
the
season
of
the
planet
s
holding
as
he
did
the
then
prevailing
view
that
the
regions
were
bodies
of
water
he
regarded
those
of
intermediate
tint
as
vast
marshes
or
swamps
and
he
accounted
for
change
of
hue
in
them
as
due
to
inundations
and
occasions
of
drying
up
in
consequence
of
losing
their
water
the
seas
he
thought
had
in
places
become
so
shallow
that
the
bottom
showed
through
plausible
on
the
surface
this
theory
breaks
down
so
soon
as
it
is
subjected
to
quantitative
criticism
for
the
moment
we
try
to
track
the
water
we
detect
the
inadequacy
of
the
clew
the
enormous
areas
over
which
the
phenomenon
occurs
necessitates
the
establishing
an
alibi
for
all
the
lost
water
that
has
gone
drying
up
on
such
a
scale
would
mean
the
removal
of
many
feet
of
liquid
over
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miles
in
extent
to
produce
any
such
change
in
appearance
as
we
witness
even
on
the
supposition
that
these
seas
were
none
too
deep
to
start
with
would
involve
lowering
the
level
of
the
water
by
from
five
to
twenty
feet
throughout
two
thirds
of
the
whole
surface
of
the
southern
hemisphere
this
would
leave
a
heap
of
waters
to
be
accounted
for
bewildering
in
its
immensity
the
myriad
tons
of
it
must
be
disposed
of
either
by
drainage
into
other
regions
or
by
being
caught
up
into
the
sky
in
this
emergency
it
might
seem
at
first
as
if
the
polar
cap
of
the
opposite
hemisphere
offered
itself
as
a
possible
reservoir
for
the
momentarily
superfluous
fluid
but
such
outlet
to
the
problem
is
at
once
closed
by
the
simple
fact
that
when
the
lightening
of
the
dark
regions
of
the
southern
hemisphere
takes
place
the

note
from
what
has
been
said
above
about
the

in

from

ourselves

what

we
note
something

so
soon

put
the

a

proves
to
satisfy

we
are
more
justified
in
deeming
them

marine

we

the

were
such
as
clearly
to
betoken
the

what
schiaparelli
had

ably
inferred

that
it
is

can
scarcely
be
doubted
from
the
timeliness
of
its
occurrence
and
that
different
portions
of
its
terrane
successively
underwent
their
metamorphosis
shows
further
that
it
followed
a
law
peculiar
to
the
planet
to
which
we
shall
be
introduced
when
we
come
to
consider
the
phenomena

the

instances
of
relative
hue
in
different
dark
patches
corroboratory
of
seasonal
variation
and
therefore
of
vegetal
constitution
might
easily
be
adduced
thus
in
during
the
summer
of
the
northern
hemisphere
the
mare
acidalium
was
notably
darker
than
the
mare
erythraeum
to
the
north
of
it
which
is
what
the
law
of
seasonal
variation
would
require
since

not
to
add

for
there
are
no
phenomena
that
contradict
it
we
conclude
therefore
that
the
areas
of
mars
are
not
seas
but
areas
of
vegetation

as

in
from

to

has
produced
a
complete
alteration
in
our
judgment
of
the
present
state
of
the

it
destroys
the
analogy
which
was
supposed
to
exist
between
mars
and
our
earth
and
by
abolishing
the
actuality
of

there
seems
metaphorically
to
put
us
at
first
all
the
more
at
sea
in
our
attempt
to
understand
the
planet
but
looked
at
more
carefully
it
turns
out
to
explain
much
that
was
obscure
and
in
so
doing
gives
us
at
once
a
wider
view
of
the
history
of
planetary
evolution
the
trait
concerned
is
cosmic
study
of
the
several
planets
of
our
solar
system
notably
the
earth
moon
and
mars
reveals
tolerably
legibly
an
interesting
phase
of
a
planet

career
which
apparently
must
happen
to
all
such
bodies
and
evidently
has
happened
or
is
happening
to
these
three
the
transition
of
its
surface
from
a
terraqueous
to
a
purely
terrestrial
condition
the
terraqueous
state
is
well
exhibited
by
our
own
earth
at
the
moment
where
lands
and
oceans
share
the
surface
between
them
the
terrestrial
is
exemplified
by
both
the
moon
and
mars
on
whose
surfaces
no
bodies
of
water
at
present
exist
that
the
one
state
passes
by
process
of
development
into
the
other
i
shall
now
give
my
reasons
for
believing
in
the
first
place
the
appearance
of
the
dark
markings
both
on
the
moon
and
mars
hints
that
though
seas
no
longer
they
were
seas
once
upon
a
time
on
the
moon
not
only
does
their
shape
suggest
this
previous
condition
but
the
smooth
and
even
look
of
their
surfaces
adds
to
the
cogency
of
the
inference
more
important
however
than
either
of
these
characteristics
and
confirmatory
of
both
is
the
fact
that
the
great
tracts
in
question
seem
to
lie
below
the
level
of
the
corrugated
surface
which
is
thickly
strewn
with
volcanic
cones
their
level
and
their
levelness
fay
in
explanation
into
one
another
the
first
makes
possible
the
former
presence
of
water
the
second
speaks
of
its
effect
for
their
flat
character
hints
that
these
areas
were
held
down
at
the
time
when
the
other
parts
of
the
surface
were
being
violently
thrown
up
that
they
can
themselves
be
cooled
lava
flows
their
extent
and
position
seem
enough
to
negative
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
they
should
in
that
case
lie
above
not
below
the
general
level
something
therefore
covered
them
during
the
moon
s
eruptive
youth
and
disappeared
later
such
superincumbence
may
well
have
been
water
under
which
the
now
great
plains
lay
then
as

in

in
epitaph
what
was
the
truth
in
its
day
only
doubtfully
offered
here
for
the
moon
for
mars
the
inference
seems
more
sure
here
again
the
dark
regions
not
only
look
as
they
should
had
they
had
an
earlier
history
but
they
too
seem
to
lie
below
the
level
of
the
surface
round
about
when
they
pass
over
the
terminator
they
invariably
show
as
flattenings
upon
it
as
if
a
slice
of
the
surface
had
been
pared
off
such
profile
in
such
pass
is
what
ground
at
a
lower
level
would
present
undoubtedly
a
part
of
the
seeming
depression
is
due
to
relative
absence
of
irradiation
consequent
upon
a
more
sombre
tint
but
loss
of
light
hardly
seems
capable
of
the
whole
effect
in
the
case
of
mars
then
as
with
the
moon
a
mistaken
inference
builded
better
than
it
knew
if
indeed
we
should
rightly
consider
an
inference
to
be
mistaken
which
on
half
data
lands
us
at
the
right
door
from
the
aspects
of
the
dark
regions
we
are
led
then
to
regard
mars
as
having
passed
through
that
stage
of
existence
in
which
the
earth
finds
itself
at
the
moment
the
stage
at
which
oceans
and
seas
form
a
feature
of
its
landscape
and
an
impediment
to
subjugation
of
its
surface
in
its
entirety
what
once
were
ocean
beds
have
become
ocean
bottoms
devoid
of
that
which
originally
filled
them
that
the
process
of
parting
with
a
watery
envelop
is
an
inevitable
concomitant
of
the
evolution
of
a
planet
from
chaos
to
world
we
do
not
have
to
go
so
far
afield
as
mars
and
the
moon
for
testimony
scrutiny
reveals
as
much
in
the
history
of
our
own
globe
two
signposts
of
the
past
one
geologic
the
other
paleontologic
point
unmistakably
in
this
direction
the
geologic
guides
us
the
more
directly
to
the
goal
study
of
the
earth
s
surface
reveals
the
preponderating
encroachment
of
the
land
upon
the
sea
since
both
began
to
be
and
demonstrates
that
except
for
local
losses
the
oceans
have
been
contracting
in
size
from
archaic
times
so
much
is
evidenced
by
the
successive
places
upon
which
marine
beds
have
been
laid
down
this
suggests
itself
at
once
as
a
theoretic
probability
to
one
considering
the
matter
from
a
cosmic
standpoint
and
it
is
therefore
the
more
interesting
and
conclusive
that
from
an
entirely
different
it
should
have
been
one
of
the
pet
propositions
of
the
late
professor
dana
who
worked
out
conclusively
the
problem
for
north

published

it

credit
this

we

impute
it

to
note
that
many
of

in

approaching
the

and

they
later
developed
into
monotremes
and
marsupials
not
rising
in

above
the

we
come
upon
the
first
true
or
placental
mammals
with
their
culmination
up
to
date
in

in
the
eocene
they
were
of
a
primitive
type
they
were
also
of
a
comprehensive
one

to

anything
from

specialized

and
some
on
the
whole

for

to
the

in
the
eocene
through
the
same
degenerate
proclivity
that
had
characterized
the
ages
before
the
earth
was
growing
colder
though
still
fairly
warm
and
with
the
fall
in
temperature
the
higher
types
of
life
antithetically
rose
evolution
gradually
fitting
them
to
cope
with
more
advanced
conditions
in
this
manner
did
the
land
supplant
the
sea
as
the
essential
feature
of
the
earth
s
surface
first
in
coming
into
being
and
then
by
offering
conditions
fraught
with
greater
possibilities
as
the
habitat
of
the
most
advanced
forms
of
life
both
plants
and
animals
the
possibility
of
advance
in
evolution
was
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
the
land
did
thus
supplant
the
sea
spontaneous
variation
the
as
yet
unexplained
in
the
genesis
of
species
is
probably
to
be
referred
to
chemism
and
is
likely
later
to
receive
its
solution
at
the
hands
of
that
science
in
the
meanwhile
it
is
evident
that
unless
the
variation
obtain
encouragement
from
the
environment
no
advance
in
type
occurs
now
the
land
offers
to
an
organism
sufficiently
evolved
to
benefit
by
it
opportunities
the
sea
does
not
possess
first
of
these
undoubtedly
is
the
care
it
enables
to
be
given
to
the
young
to
cast
one
s
brood
upon
the
waters
is
not
the
best
method
of
insuring
its
bringing
up
there
is
too
much
of
the
uncertainties
of
wave
and
current
to
make
the
process
a
healthy
one
and
even
when
attached
to
rocks
and
seaweed
the
attachment
to
a
mother
is
to
be
preferred
without
a
period
of
infancy
when
the
young
is
unable
to
do
for
itself
no
great
development
is
possible
in
the
only
striking
exception
the
case
of
the
whales
dolphins
and
porpoises
size
has
probably
counted
for
much
in
the
matter
while
the
development
of
the
cetaceans
is
far
behind
that
of
the
majority
of
land
mammals
change
of
place
not
in
distance
but
in
variety
is
another
factor
the
sea
is
same
as
a
habitat
one
square
mile
of
it
being
much
like
another
except
for
gradually
changing
temperature
the
land
on
the

its
accidented

presents
all
manner
of
diversity
in
the
conditions
and
the
more
varied
the
conditions
to
which
the
organism
is
exposed
the
greater
its
own
complexity
must
be
to
enable
it
to
meet
them
that
the
terrestrial
stage
of
planetary
development
is
subsequent
to
the
terraqueous
one
and
must
of
necessity
succeed
it
if
the

exist
on

from
the
loss
of
internal
heat
on
the
one
hand
and
from
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases
on
the
other
to
which
of
the
two
to
attribute
the
lion
s
share
in
the
business
is
matter
for
doubt
but
that
both
must
be
concerned
in
it
we
may
take
for
certain
so
long
as
the
internal
heat
suffices
to
keep
the
body
fluid
the
liquid
itself
sees
to
it
that
all
interstices
are
filled
as
the
heat
dissipates
the
body
begins
to
solidify
starting
with
the
crust
for
cosmic
purposes
it
undoubtedly
still
remains
plastic
but
cracks
of
relatively
small
size
are
both
formed
and
persist
into
these
the
surface
water
seeps
with
continued
refrigeration
the
crust
thickens
more
cracks
are
opened
and
more
water
given
lodgment
within
to
the
impoverishment
of
the
seas
the
process
would
continue
till
the
pressure
of
the
crust
itself
rendered
plastic
all
that
lay
below
beyond
which
of
course
no
fissures
could
be
formed
how
competent
to
swallow
all
the
seas
such
earth
cuticle
cracks
may
be
we
ignore
for
we
can
not
be
said
to
know
much
of
the
process
we
can
only
infer
that
to
a
certain
extent
internal
absorption
of
surface
seas
must
mark
a
stage
of
the
evolution
by
which
a
star
becomes
a
world
and
then
an
inert
mass
one
of
the
dark
bodies
of
which
space
is
full
of
the
other
means
we
know
more
we
are
certain
that
it
must
take
place
though
we
are
in
doubt
as
to
the
amount
it
has
already
accomplished
this
method
of
depletion
is
by
the
departure
of
the
water
in
the
form
of
gas
in
consequence
of
the
molecular
motions
if
we
knew
the
temperature
and
the
age
of
mars
and
also
the
amount
of
atmosphere
originally
surrounding
it
we
could
possibly
predicate
its
state
reversely
we
can
infer
something
as
to
age
and
temperature
from
its
present
condition

devoid
of

of
some
kind
vegetal
and
animal
the
worst
conditioned
are
not
what
one
is
taught
in
childhood
to
believe
a
desert
to
vast
waste
of
sand
with
a
camel
and
a
palm
thrown
in
to
heighten
the
sterility

it
is

not

kind
to
boast
of
being
rather
a
d
as

and
the
like
but
what
is
of
interest
here
in
the
connection
is
its
color
for
it
is
commonly
of
a
more
ochreish
tint
than
usual
in
keeping
with
its
surroundings
a
paling
out
of
the
green
to
something
more
tawny
indicating
a
relative
reduction
of
the
chlorophyll
and
an
increase
of
the
lipochromes
in
the
tissues
of
the
plant
since
the
one
gives
the
green
tint
to
the
leaves
the
other
the

as
this
vegetation
poor
as
it
is
has
its
annual
history
it
must
alter
the
look
of
the
desert
at
times
and
produce
precisely
those
slight
variations
in
tint
observable
on
mars
in
like
circumstance
the
arizona
desert
dates
from
no
further
back
than
early
tertiary
times
as
the
limestone
of
the
cretaceous
there
present
shows
water
then
stretched
where
desert
now
is
and
the
limestone
beds
were
laid
down
in
it
how
old
the
martian
saharas
are
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
but
one
thing
we
may
predicate
about
both
a
desert
is
not
an
original
but
an
acquired
condition
of
a
planet
s
surface
demonstrably
so
in
the
case
of
a
planet
which
has
had
a
sedimentary
epoch
in
its
in
the
arizona
desert
the
surface
is
composed
of
depositary
rocks
of
mesozoic
times
except
where
lava
streams
have
flowed
down
over
it
since
then
the
land
then
was
once
under
water
and
can
not
but
have
been
fertile
for
some
time
after
it
emerged
but
we
are
not
left
to
inference
in
the
matter
however
good
that
inference
may
be
a
little
to
the
south
of
the
painted
desert
in
the
midst
of
the
barren
plateau
of
northern
arizona
of
which
the
former
makes
a
part
stand
the
remains
of
a
petrified
forest
huge
chalcedony
trunks
of
trees
so
savingly
transmuted
into
stone
that
their
genus
is
still
decipherable
lie
scattered
here
over
the
barren
ground
in
waste
profusion
one
of
them
still
spanning
a
cañon
just
as
it
fell
in
that
to
it
destructive
day
of
a
far
prehistoric
past
the
rock
stratum
on
which
their
remains
lie
is
of
triassic
and
cretaceous
times
and
the
petrifications
show
that
in
the
cretaceous
a
stately
forest
overspread
the
land
in
those
days
at
least
the
spot
was
fertile
where
now
sparse
sagebrush
and
cacti
find
a
living
hard
not
here
alone
where
the
blocks
are
so
conspicuous
as
to
invite
their
carrying
away
is
a
former
flourishing
growth
of
vegetation
attested
but
over
large
adjoining
areas
of

search
has
brought
the
like

to

of

look
down
upon

one
which
in
earlier
eras
was
as
as
they
their
lofty
oasis
is
all
that
is
now
left
of
a
once
fertile
country
the
retreat
of
the

in
consequence
of
a
diminishing

until
a
rise
of
two

feet
from
what
once
was
is
necessary
to
reach
the
of
today
being
typical
of
desert
lands
and
testifying
to
greater
aqueous
affluence
in
the
past
in
the
same
manner
streams
descend
from
the
range
of
the
lebanon
to
lose
themselves
in
the
arabian
desert
just
without
the
doors
of

desiccated
within

palestine
a

flowing

milk
and
honey
can
hardly
flow
poor
water
now
and
furnishes
another
straw
to
mark
the
ebbing
of
the
water
supply
this
making
of
deserts
is
not
a
sporadic
accidental
or
local
matter
although
local
causes
have
abetted
or
hindered
it
on
the
contrary
it
is
an
inevitable
result
of
planetary
evolution
a
phase
of
that
evolution
which
follows
from
what
has
been
said
in
chapter
xii
on
the
abandonment
of
a
planet
by
its
water
deserts
are
simply
another
sign
of
the
same
process
the
very
aging
which
began
by
depriving
a
body
of
its
seas
takes
from
it
later
its
forest
and
its
grass
a
growing
scarcity
of
water
is
bound
to
depauperate
the
one
as
it
depletes
the
other
we
have
positive
proof
of
the
action
in
our
own
deserts
for
these
bear
testimony
in
places
at
least
to
not
having
always
been
so
but
to
have
gradually
become
so
within
relatively
recent
times
but
we
have
more
general
proof
of
the
action
from
the
position
occupied
on
the
earth
s
surface
by
its
deserts
the
significant
fact
about
the
so
stealthily
going
on
is
that
only
certain
zones
of
the
earth
s
surface
are
affected
those
belting
the
two
tropics
of
cancer
and
capricorn
for
several
degrees
on
either
side
of
them
most
exhibit
the
phenomenon
such
positioning
of
the
deserts
is
not
due
to
chance
directly
of
course
desertism
is
due
to
dearth
of
rain
this
in
turn
depends
on
the
character
and
condition
of
the
winds
if
a
wind
laden
with
moisture
travel
into
a
colder
region
of
the
globe
its
moisture
is
precipitated
in
rain
and
we
have
a
fertile
country
if
it
voyage
into
a
warmer
clime
it
takes
up
what
little
moisture
may
be
there
already
and
a
desert
is
the
result
now
our
system
of
winds
is
such
as
to
produce
a
fall
of
rain
for
the
different

tabulated

in

the

and
the

the

the

are
wavy
bands
which
by
their
form
betray
both
a
general
underlying
trend
to
drought
at
these
parallels
and
also
the
effect
of
local
topography
in
the
matter
from
being
distributed
thus
in

it
is
evident
that
the
deserts
are
general
globe
phenomena
and
from
their
being
found
only
in
the
zones
of
least

therefore
it

be

in
consequence
desertism
should
have
overtaken
more
of
its

instead
of

we
should
expect
to
find

saharas

vast

the

the

as

adequately
picture

what

waterless

in
having

what
a
terrible
significance
for

martian
lies
in
that
single
word
chapter
xiv
summary
if
now
we
review
with
the
mind
s
eye
the
several
features
of
mars
which
we
have
surveyed
with
the
bodily
one
we
shall
be
surprised
to
find
to
what
they
commit
us
suggestive
as
each
is
considered
by
itself
the
into
which
they
combine
proves
of
multiplicate
force
in
its
implication
for
each
turns
out
to
fit
into
place
in
one
consistent
whole
a
scheme
of
things
in
which
are
present
all
the
conditions
necessary
to
the
existence
and
continuance
of
those
processes
which
constitute
what
we
call
life
in
short
we
are
conducted
with
a
cogency
which
grows
as
we
consider
it
to
the
conclusion
that
mars
is
habitable
two
ways
of
appreciating
this
cogency
are
open
to
us
we
may
treat
it
with
the
simple
reasoning
of
as
we
should
a
dissected
map
or
a
piece
of
machinery
in
which
we
realize
we
are
right
when
the
several
parts
at
last
fit
together
and
the
picture
stands
revealed
or
the
machine
works
or
we
may
subject
the
evidence
to
quantitative
estimates
for
and
against
by
the
doctrine
of
probabilities
and
thus
evaluate
the
chances
of
its
being
correct
consciously
or
unconsciously
this
is
what
we
are
about
in
our
decisions
every
day
of
our
lives
at
the
one
end
of
the
line
are
those
skillful
judgments
where
the
balance
is
so
that
the
least
overweight
on
the
one
side
dips
the
scales
to
a
conclusion
at
the
other
extremity
stand
those
deductions
which
we
usually
speak
of
as
proved
such
as
the
law
of
gravitation
but
both
assurances
rest
really
upon
probability
and
differ
only
in
degree
what
we
mean
by
proof
of
anything
is
that
a
supposition
advanced
to
account
for
it
explains
all
the
facts
and
is
not
opposed
to
any
of
them
and
that
the
balance
of
probability
in
consequence
is
very
largely
in
its
favor
now
if
several
pieces
of
evidence
distinct
in
their
origin
concur
to
a
given
conclusion
the
probability
that
that
conclusion
is
correct
is
far
greater
than
what
results
from
each
alone
and
mounts
up
soon
to
something
much
exceeding
what
bettors
at
races
call
certainty
odds
however
unversed
the
average
man
may
be
in
calculating
the
probability
he
recognizes
the
fact
in
his
dealings
with
his
fellows
by
the
way
he
attaches
weight
to
concurrent
testimony
it
is
such
concurrent
evidence
that
we
have
now
to
consider
to
this
end
we
will
marshal
the
several
facts
ascertained
in
a
summarized
list
for
their
easier
intercomparison
these
facts
are
mars
turns
on
its
axis
in
with
reference
to
the
stars
and
in
as
a
mean
with
regard
to
the
sun
its
day
therefore
is
only
about
forty
minutes
longer
than
ours
its
axis
is
tilted
to
the
plane
of
its
orbit
by
about
most
recent
determination
this
gives
the
planet
seasons
almost
the
counterpart
of
our
own
in
character
but
in
length
nearly
double
ours
for
its
year
consists
of
of
our
days
of
its
own
polar
caps
are
plainly
visible
which
melt
in
the
martian
summer
to
form
again
in
the
martian
winter
thus
implying
the
presence
of
a
substance
deposited
by
cold
as
the
polar
caps
melt
they
are
bordered
by
a
blue
belt
which
retreats
with
them
this
excludes
the
possibility
of
their
being
formed
of
carbon
dioxide
and
shows
that
of
all
the
substances
we
know
the
material
composing
them
must
be
water
in
the
case
of
the
southern
cap
the
blue
belt
has
widenings
in
it
in
places
these
occur
where
the
areas
bordering
upon
the
polar
cap
are
largest
the
extensive
shrinkage
of
the
polar
snows
shows
their
quantity
to
be
inconsiderable
and
points
to
scanty
deposition
due
to
dearth
of
water
the
melting
takes
place
locally
after
the
same
general
order
and
method
martian
year
after
year
both
in
the
south
cap
and
in
the
north
one
this
is
evidenced
by
the
recurrence
of
rifts
in
the
same
places
annually
in
each
the
water
thus
let
loose
can
therefore
be
locally
counted
on
that
the
south
polar
cap
is
given
to
greater
extremes
than
the
north
one
implies
again
in
view
of
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
and
the
tilt
of
the
axis
that
deposition
in
both
caps
is
light
the
polar
seas
at
the
edges
of
the
caps
being
temporary
affairs
the
water
from
them
must
be
fresh
the
melting
of
the
caps
on
the
one
hand
and
their
reforming
on
the
other
affirm
the
presence
of
water
vapor
in
the
martian
atmosphere
of
whatever
else
that
air
consist
since
water
vapor
is
present
of
which
the
molecular
weight
is
it
follows
from
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases
that
nitrogen
oxygen
and
carbonic
acid
of
molecular
weights
and
respectively
are
probably
there
too
owing
to
being
heavier
the
bears
testimony
to
this
atmosphere
the
planet
s
low
albedo
points
to
a
density
for
the
atmosphere
very
much
less
than
our
own
the
apparent
evidence
of
a
twilight
goes
to
confirm
this
permanent
markings
show
upon
the
disk
proving
that
the
surface
itself
is
visible
outside
of
the
polar
cap
the
disk
is
divided
into
and
regions
the
stretches
have
the
same
appearance
as
our
deserts
seen
from
afar
and
behave
as
such
being
but
little
affected
by
change
the
areas
were
once
thought
to
be
seas
but
they
can
not
be
such
because
they
change
in
tint
according
to
the
martian
season
and
the
area
and
amount
of
the
lightening
is
not
offset
at
the
time
by
corresponding
darkening
elsewhere
nor
by
any
augmentation
of
the
other
polar
cap
or
precipitation
into
cloud
it
can
not
therefore
be
due
to
shift
of
substance
furthermore
they
are
all
seamed
by
lines
and
spots
darker
than
themselves
which
are
permanent
in
place
so
that
there
can
be
no
bodies
of
water
on
the
planet
on
the
other
hand
their
color
is
that
of
vegetation
this
regularly
fades
out
as
vegetation
would
to
ochre
for
the
most
part
but
in
places
changes
to
a
the
change
that
comes
over
them
is
seasonal
in
period
as
that
of
vegetation
would
be
each
hemisphere
undergoes
this
metamorphosis
in
turn
that
it
is
recurrent
is
again
proof
positive
of
an
atmosphere
the
changes
are
metabolic
since
those
in
one
direction
are
later
reversed
to
a
restoration
of
the
original
status
anabolic
as
well
as
katabolic
processes
thus
go
on
there
that
is
growth
as
well
as
decay
takes
place
this
proves
them
of
vegetal
origin
the
existence
of
vegetation
shows
that
carbonic
acid
oxygen
and
undoubtedly
nitrogen
are
present
in
the
martian
atmosphere
since
plants
give
out
oxygen
and
take
in
carbonic
acid
the
changes
in
the
dark
areas
follow
upon
the
melting
of
the
polar
caps
not
occurring
until
after
that
melting
is
under
way
and
not
immediately
then
but
only
after
the
lapse
of
a
certain
time
though
not
seas
now
from
their
look
the
dark
areas
suggest
old
sea
bottoms
and
when
on
the
terminator
appear
as
depressions
whether
because
really
at
a
lower
level
or
because
of
less
illumination
is
not
certain
that
they
are
now
the
parts
of
the
planet
to
support
vegetation
hints
the
same
past
office
as
water
would
naturally
drain
into
them
that
such
a
metamorphosis
should
occur
with
planetary
aging
is
in
keeping
with
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases
terminator
observations
prove
conclusively
that
there
are
no
mountains
on
mars
but
that
the
surface
is
surprisingly
flat
but
they
do
reveal
clouds
which
are
usually
rare
and
are
often
if
not
always
white
spots
are
occasionally
visible
lasting
unchanged
for
weeks
in
the
tropic
and
temperate
regions
showing
that
the
climate
is
apparently
cold
but
at
the
same
time
proving
that
most
of
the
surface
has
a
temperature
above
the
in
winter
the
temperate
zones
are
more
or
less
covered
by
a
whitish
veil
which
may
be
or
may
be
cloud
a
spring
haze
surrounds
the
north
polar
cap
during
the
weeks
that
follow
its
most
extensive
melting
otherwise
the
martian
sky
is
perfectly
clear
like
that
of
a
dry
and
desert
land
the
way
in
which
these
articles
fit
into
one
another
to
a
mortised
whole
is
striking
enough
at
first
sight
but
becomes
more
and
more
impressive
the
more
one
considers
it
for
some
are
due
to
one
kind
of
observation
some
to
another
in
the
taking
they
are
unrelated
yet
in
the
result
they
agree
equally
pregnant
is
the
history
of
their
acquisition
most
of
them
were
detected
as
the
outcome
of
observations
at
the
opposition
of
and
led
to
the
theory
which
was
published
in
the
writer
s
first
book
on
the
subject
others
are
the
result
of
the
five
oppositions
that
have
since
occurred
these
have
proved
entirely
corroborative
of
the
previous
ones
and
of
the
theory
then
deduced
and
that
in
two
distinct
ways
first
by
the
accumulated
evidence
they
have
brought
to
the
matter
along
the
old
lines
and
secondly
by
what
they
have
revealed
in
new
directions
of
these
articles
of
martian
scientific
faith
in
observation
or
deduction
and
are
in
whole
or
part
new
that
continued
scrutiny
is
thus
corroborative
of
the
earlier
results
both
along
the
old
and
along
new
lines
of
investigation
warrants
additional
confidence
in
the
conclusion
considering
now
these
counts
we
see
that
they
make
reasonably
evident
on
mars
the
presence
of
days
and
seasons
substantially
like
our
own
an
atmosphere
containing
water
vapor
carbonic
acid
and
oxygen
water
in
great
scarcity
a
temperature
colder
than
ours
but
above
the
fahrenheit
except
in
winter
and
in
the
extreme
polar
regions
vegetation
first
and
foremost
of
these
is
air
in
order
to
make
it
possible
for
vital
processes
of
any
sort
to
take
place
the
body
of
a
planet
must
be
clothed
with
an
atmosphere
by
the
modesty
of
nature
the
old
astronomers
would
have
said
such
a
covering
subserves
two
purposes
it
keeps
out
the
cold
of
space
thus
permitting
the
maintenance
of
a
temperature
sufficient
to
support
life
and
it
affords
a
medium
through
which
metabolism
can
go
on
now
the
presence
of
air
is
attested
first
and
foremost
by
the
fact
of
change
in
the
martian
markings
and
the
changes
observed
are
conspicuous
are
both
inorganic
in
the
case
of
the
polar
caps
and
and
metabolic
or
organic
and
in
the
case
of
the
areas
that
is
they
consist
of
building
up
as
well
as
of
pulling
down
and
are
in
occurrence
such
changes
could
not
occur
in
the
absence
of
an
atmosphere
they
show
that
this
atmosphere
consists
of
water
vapor
carbonic
acid
and
oxygen
the
the
apparent
evidence
of
a
twilight
arc
and
the
planet
s
low
albedo
indicate
that
this
atmosphere
is
thin
the
appearance
of
the
surface
suggests
cold
indicative
again
of
a
thin
air
such
tenuity
is
in
accord
with
what
principles
would
lead
us
to
expect
and
tends
to
show
that
reliance
on
general
principles
is
here
not
misplaced
a
point
of
some
interest
lastly
the
occurrence
of
clouds
visibly
floating
and
traveling
over
the
surface
and
haze
at
times
proves
in
another
way
the
existence
of
the
medium
in
which
alone
this
could
be
possible
water
is
the
next
substance
vital
to
planetary
life
as
to
its
actual
presence
the
polar
caps
have
most
to
say
as
to
its
relative
absence
the
rest
of
the
disk
the
forthright
conception
of
the
polar
caps
as
composed
of
snow
and
ice
is
borne
out
by
further
investigation
into
what
could
cause
the
observed
phenomenon
carbonic
acid
the
only
other
substance
we
know
capable
in
any
way
of
resembling
what
we
see
turns
out
not
capable
of
producing
one
important
detail
of
the
caps
appearance
the
blue
band
which
accompanies
them
in
their
retreat
water
alone
could
do
this
the
melting
of
the
caps
shows
that
water
vapor
must
be
a
constituent
of
the
martian
atmosphere
moreover
as
the
molecular
weight
of
water
vapor
is
less
than
that
of
oxygen
or
nitrogen
or
carbon
dioxide
if
the
former
can
exist
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
planet
must
these
other
gases
so
that
from
this
we
have
knowledge
of
the
possibility
of
the
presence
of
oxygen
nitrogen
and
carbon
dioxide
there
from
we
saw
that
their
actual
existence
is
demonstrated
the
next
step
is
the
ascertainment
that
the
water
is
in
very
small
amount
the
extensive
melting
of
the
caps
shows
their
quantity
to
be
inconsiderable
which
is
the
first
fact
pointing
to
a
dearth
of
water
the
second
comes
from
the
aspect
and
behavior
of
the
regions
which
proclaim
them
deserts
and
the
third
from
the
detection
of
the
character
of
the
areas
as
not
seas
and
in
several
different
ways
study
of
these
regions
asserts
their
constitution
the
easiest
to
appreciate
being
that
they
are
traversed
by
permanent
dark
lines
and
other
equally
sedentary
markings
no
bodies
of
water
therefore
are
to
be
seen
outside
of
the
ephemeral
polar
seas
immediately
surrounding
the
caps
as
they
melt
this
leads
us
to
the
third
presence
on
mars
indicative
of
a
living
world
vegetation
the
other
two
spoke
of
substances
necessary
to
life
the
premises
in
the
case
this
one
of
organic
existence
itself
its
conclusion
the
evidence
consists
of
static
testimony
from
the
look
of
the
areas
and
of
kinematic
derived
from
their
behavior
and
vegetation
would
present
exactly
the
appearance
shown
by
them
and
nothing
that
we
know
of
but
vegetation
could
but
suggestive
as
their
appearance
is
it
is
as
nothing
compared
with
the
cogent
telltale
character
of
their
behavior
the
seasonal
change
that
sweeps
over
them
is
metabolic
constructive
as
well
as
destructive
that
is
and
proclaims
an
organic
constitution
for
them
such
as
only
vegetation
could
produce
in
tint
their
metamorphoses
are
those
of
the
same
substance
for
the
lapses
into
ochre
and
revives
again
to
just
as
vegetation
does
on
our
own
earth
at
the
proper
season
of
the
year
taking
both

of

the
canals
from
the
detection
of
the
main
markings
that
diversify
the
surface
of
mars
we
now
pass
to
a
discovery
of
so
unprecedented
a
character
that
the
scientific
world
was
at
first
loath
to
accept
it
only
persistent
corroboration
has
finally
broken
down
distrust
and
even
so
doubt
of
the
genuineness
of
the
phenomena
still
lingers
in
the
minds
of
many
who
have
not
themselves
seen
the
sight
because
of
the
inherent
difficulty
of
the
observations
for
it
is
not
one
where
confirmation
may
be
summoned
in
the
laboratory
at
will
but
one
demanding
that
the
watcher
should
wait
upon
the
sky
with
more
than
ordinary
acumen
this
revelation
is
the
discovery
of
the
canals
quite
unlike
in
look
to
the
main
features
of
the
planet
s
face
is
this
second
set
of
markings
which
traverse
its
disk
and
which
the
genius
of
schiaparelli
disclosed
unnatural
they
may
well
be
deemed
for
they
are
not
in
the
least
what
one
would
expect
to
see
they
differ
from
the
first
class
not
in
degree
but
in
kind
and
the
kind
is
of
a
wholly
unparalleled
sort
while
the
former
bear
a
family
resemblance
to
those
of
the
earth
the
latter
are
peculiar
to
mars
finding
no
counterpart
upon
the
earth
at
all
introduction
to
the
mystery
came
about
in
this
wise
and
will
be
repeated
for
him
who
is
successful
in
his
search
when
a
fairly
acute
eyed
observer
sets
himself
to
scan
the
telescopic
disk
of
the
planet
in
steady
air
he
will
after
noting
the
dazzling
contour
of
the
white
polar
cap
and
the
sharp
outlines
of
the
seas
of
a
sudden
be
made
aware
of
a
vision
as
of
a
thread
stretched
somewhere
from
the
across
the
orange
areas
of
the
disk
gone
as
quickly
as
it
came
he
will
instinctively
doubt
his
own
eyesight
and
credit
to
illusion
what
can
so
unaccountably
disappear
gaze
as
hard
as
he
will
no
power
of
his
can
recall
it
when
with
the
same
startling
abruptness
the
thing
stands
before
his
eyes
again
convinced
after
three
or
four
such
showings
that
the
vision
is
real
he
will
still
be
left
wondering
what
and
where
it
was
for
so
short
and
sudden
are
its
apparitions
that
the
locating
of
it
is
dubiously
hard
it
is
gone
each
time
before
he
has
got
its
bearings
by
persistent
watch
however
for
the
best
instants
of
definition
backed
by
the
knowledge
of
what
he
is
to
see
he
will
find
its
coming
more
frequent
more
certain
and
more
detailed
at
last
some
particularly
propitious
moment
will
disclose
its
relation
to
points
and
its
position
be
assured
first
one
such
thread
and
then
another
will
make
its
presence
evident
and
then
he
will
note
that
each
always
appears
in
place
repetition
will
convince
him
that
these
strange
visitants
are
as
real
as
the
main
markings
and
are
as
permanent
as
they
such
is
the
experience
every
observer
of
them
has
had
and
success
depends
upon
the
acuteness
of
the
observer
s
eye
and
upon
the
persistence
with
which
he
watches
for
the
best
moments
in
the
steadiest
air
certain
as
persistence
is
to
be
rewarded
at
last
the
difficulty
inherent
in
the
observations
is
ordinarily
great
not
everybody
can
see
these
delicate
features
at
first
sight
even
when
pointed
out
to
them
and
to
perceive
their
more
minute
details
takes
a
trained
as
well
as
an
acute
eye
observing
under
the
best
conditions
when
so
viewed
however
the
disk
of
the
planet
takes
on
a
most
singular
appearance
it
looks
as
if
it
had
been
cobwebbed
all
over
suggestive
of
a
spider
s
web
seen
against
the
grass
of
a
spring
morning
a
mesh
of
fine
reticulated
lines
overspreads
it
which
with
attention
proves
to
compass
the
globe
from
one
pole
to
the
other
the
chief
difference
between
it
and
a
spider
s
work
is
one
of
size
supplemented
by
greater
complexity
but
both
are
joys
of
geometric
beauty
for
the
lines
are
of
individually
uniform
width
of
exceeding
tenuity
and
of
great
length
these
are
the
martian
canals
two
stages
in
the
recognition
of
the
reality
confront
the
persevering
plodder
first
the
perception
of
the
canals
at
all
and
second
the
realization
of
their
very
definite
character
it
is
wholly
due
to
lack
of
suitable
conditions
that
the
true
form
of
the
martian
lines
is
usually
missed
given
the
proper
prerequisites
of
location
or
of
eye
and
their
peculiarity
stands
forth
unmistakably
confessed
it
is
only
where
the
seeing
or
the
sight
is
at
fault
that
the
canals
either
fail
to
show
or
appear
as
diffuse
streaks
the
latter
being
a
halfway
revelation
between
the
reality
and
their
not
being
revealed
at
all
much
misconception
exists
on
this
point
it
has
been
supposed
that
improved
atmospheric
conditions
simply
amount
to
bringing
the
object
nearer
by
permitting
greater
magnification
without
altering
the
hazy
look
of
its
detail
not
so
they
do
much
more
than
this
they
steady
the
object
much
as
if
a
page
of
print
from
being
violently
shaken
should
suddenly
be
held
still
the
observer
would
at
once
read
what
before
had
escaped
him
for
being
a
blur
so
is
it
with
the
canals
in
reality
pencilings
of
extreme
tenuity
the
agitations
of
our
own
air
spread
them
into
diffuse
streaks
an
effect
of
which
any
one
may
assure
himself
by
sufficiently
rapid
motion
of
a
drawing
in
which
they
are
depicted
sharp
and
distinct
when
he
will
see
them
take
on
the
streaky
look
as
the
writer
has
observed
them
under
both
aspects
and
has
seen
them
pass
from
the
indefinite
to
the
defined
as
the
seeing
improved
he
has
had
practical
proof
of
the
fact
and
this
not
once
but
an
untold
number
of
times
atmospheric
conditions
far
superior
to
what
are
good
enough
for
most
astronomic
observations
are
needed
for
such
planetary
decipherment
and
the
observer
experienced
in
the
subject
eventually
learns
how
this
is
under
these
conditions
the
testimony
of
his
own
eyesight
upon
the
character
of
these
markings
is
definite
and
complete
and
the
first
trait
that
then
emerges
from
confusion
is
that
the
markings
are
not
simply
lines
in
the
sense
that
any
sufficiently
narrow
and
continuous
marking
may
so
be
called
but
lines
in
the
far
more
precise
sense
in
which
geometry
uses
the
term
they
are
furthermore
straight
lines
as
schiaparelli
said
of
them
they
look
to
have
been
laid
down
by
rule
and
compass
the
very
marvel
of
the
sight
has
been
its
own
to
recognition
joined
to
the
difficulty
of
its
detection
for
not
only
is
the
average
observatory
not
equipped
by
nature
for
the
task
but
what
is
not
good
air
often
masquerades
as
such
trains
of
air
waves
exist
at
times
so
fine
as
to
confuse
this
detail
or
even
to
obliterate
it
entirely
while
at
the
same
time
they
leave
the
disk
seemingly
with
the
result
that
one
not
well
versed
in
such
vagaries
thinks
to
see
well
when
in
truth
he
is
debarred
from
seeing
at
all
when
study
of
the
conditions
finally
ends
in
putting
him
upon
the
right
road
the
sight
that
rewards
him
can
hardly
be
too
graphically
described
next
to
the
fact
that
they
are
definiteness
of
direction
is
the
chief
of
their
characteristics
to
strike
the
observer
the
lines
run
straight
throughout
their
course
this
is
absolutely
true
of
ninety
per
cent
of
them
and
practically
so
of
the
remaining
ten
per
cent
since
the
latter
curve
in
an
equally
symmetric
manner
such
directness
has
i
know
not
what
of
immediate
impressiveness
quite
unlike
the
aspect
of
the
main
markings
which
show
a
natural
irregularity
of
outline
these
lines
offer
at
the
first
glance
a
most
unnatural
regularity
of
look
nothing
on
earth
of
natural
origin
on
such
a
scale
bears
them
analogue
nor
does
any
other
planet
show
the
like
they
are
in
fact
distinctively
martian
phenomena
this
is
the
first
point
in
which
they
differ
from
the
markings
we
have
hitherto
described
the
others
were
generic
planetary
features
these
are
specific
ones
peculiar
to
mars
equally
striking
is
the
uniform
width
of
each
line
from
its
beginning
to
its
end
as
it
stands
out
there
upon
the
disk
the
line
varies
not
in
size
throughout
its
course
any
more
than
it
deviates
in
direction
it
counterfeits
a
telegraph
wire
stretched
from
point
to
point
like
the
latter
seen
afar
the
width
too
is
telegraphic
for
it
is
not
so
much
width
as
want
of
it
that
is
evident
breadth
is
inferable
solely
from
the
fact
that
the
line
is
seen
at
all
and
relative
size
by
difference
of
insistency
indeed
the
apparent
breadth
has
been
steadily
contracting
as
the
instrumental
atmospheric
and
personal
conditions
have
improved
all
three
of
the
factors
have
conduced
to
such
emaceration
but
the
middle
one
the
most
for
the
air
waves
spread
every
marking
and
the
effect
is
relatively
greatest
upon
those
which
are
most
slender
as
the
currents
of
condensation
and
rarefaction
pulse
along
their
denser
and
their
thinner
portions
refract
the
rays
on
either
side
of
their
true
place
and
thus
at
the
same
time
confuse
a
marking
and
broaden
it
the
consequence
is
that
the
better
the
atmospheric
conditions
and
the
more
that
has
been
learned
about
utilizing
them
the
finer
the
lines
have
shown
themselves
to
be
herein
we
have
a
specific
intrinsic
difference
between
the
fundamental
features
and
these
lines
the
main
markings
have
extension
in
two
dimensions
the
latter
in
one
distinctive
as
they
thus
are
they
have
in
keeping
with
their
appearance
been
given
a
distinctive
name
that
of
canal
useful
as
the
name
is
and
as
we
shall
later
see
applicable
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
what
we
see
are
such
in
any
simple
sense
no
observer
of
them
has
ever
considered
them
canals
dug
like
the
suez
canal
or
the
panama
one
this
supposition
is
exclusively
of
critic
creation
their
precise
width
is
not
precisable
they
show
no
measurable
breadth
and
their
size
therefore
admits
for
certain
only
of
an
outside
limit
they
can
not
be
wider
than
a
determinable
maximum
but
they
may
be
much
less
than
this
the
sole
method
of
estimating
their
width
is
by
comparison
of
effect
with
a
wire
of
known
caliber
at
a
known
distance
for
this
purpose
a
telegraph
wire
was
stretched
against
the
sky
at
flagstaff
and
the
observers
going
back
upon
the
mesa
observed
and
recorded
its
appearance
as
their
stations
grew
remote
it
proved
surprising
at
what
great
distances
a
slender
wire
could
be
made
out
when
thus
projected
against
the
sky
the
wire
in
the
experiment
was
but
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
yet
could
be
seen
with
certainty
at
a
distance
of
feet
at
which
point
its
diameter
subtended
only
of
a
second
of
arc
how
small
this
quantity
is
may
be
appreciated
from
its
taking
more
than
ninety
such
lines
laid
side
by
side
to
make
a
width
divisible
by
the
eye
such
slenderness
at
the
then
distance
of
mars
would
correspond
under
the
magnification
commonly
used
only
to
three
quarters
of
a
mile
theoretically
then
a
line
three
quarters
of
a
mile
wide
there
should
be
visible
to
us
practically
both
light
and
definition
is
lost
in
the
telescope
and
it
would
be
nearer
the
mark
to
consider
in
such
case
two
miles
as
the
limit
of
the
perceptible
with
the
planet
nearer
than
this
as
is
often
the
case
the
width
which
could
be
seen
would
be
proportionally
lessened
perhaps
we
shall
not
be
far
astray
if
we
put
one
mile
as
the
limiting
width
which
could
be
perceived
on
mars
at
present
with
distance
at
its
least
and
definition
at
its
best
that
so
minute
a
quantity
should
be
visible
at
all
is
due
to
the
line
having
a
sensible
length
and
by
summation
of
sensations
causing
to
rise
into
consciousness
what
would
otherwise
be
lost
a
stimulus
too
feeble
to
produce
an
effect
upon
a
single
retinal
rod
becomes
recognizable
when
many
in
a
row
are
similarly
excited
the
experiment
furnished
another
criterion
of
importance
as
regards
the
supposition
that
the
lines
on
mars
are
illusory
it
showed
that
impressions
of
wires
that
did
not
exist
could
be
told
from
the
real
thing
when
the
wire
subtended
of
a
second
of
arc
or
more
that
below
this
the
outside
stimulus
was
too
weak
to
differ
recognizably
from
optic
effects
otherwise
produced
while
when
the
real
wire
was
diminished
to
it
could
not
be
seen
at
all
now
the
majority
of
lines
on
mars
so
far
recognized
and
mapped
lie
in
strength
of
impression
far
above
the
superior
limit
of
to
one
versed
in
martian
canal
detection
there
is
no
possibility
of
in
the
case
the
canals
being
very
much
more
salient
objects
to
an
expert
than
those
who
have
not
seen
them
suppose
for
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
when
one
knows
what
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
they
are
the
difficult
objects
they
seem
to
the
tyro
just
as
the
satellites
of
mars
were
easily
seen
once
they
were
discovered
so
with
these
lines
a
mile
or
two
we
may
take
then
with
safety
as
the
smallest
width
for
one
of
the
lines
the
greatest
was
got
by
comparing
what
is
by
far
the
largest
canal
the
nilosyrtis
with
the
micrometer
thread
from
such
determination
it
appeared
that
this
canal
was
from
to
miles
wide
but
it
is
questionable
whether
the
nilosyrtis
can
properly
be
termed
a
canal
so
much
does
it
exceed
the
rest
it
is
certainly
far
larger
than
the
majority
of
them
from
comparative
estimates
between
its
size
and
that
of
the
others
to
miles
for
the
width
of
the
larger
of
the
martian
canals
seems
the
most
probable
value
and
or
miles
only
of
the
more
diminutive
of
those
so
far
detected
illustration
showing
the
on
the
other
hand
the
length
of
the
canals
is
relatively
enormous
with
them
miles
is
common
while
many
exceed
and
the
is
miles
from
the
point
where
it
leaves
the
phœnix
lake
to
the
point
where
it
enters
the
trivium
charontis
this
means
much
more
on
mars
than
it
would
on
earth
owing
to
the
smaller
size
of
the
planet
such
a
length
exceeds
a
third
of
the
whole
circumference
of
its
globe
at
the
equator
but
what
is
still
more
remarkable
throughout
the
whole
of
the
long
course
taken
by
the
canal
it
swerves
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
of
the
great
circle
joining
the
two
points
of
these
several
peculiarities
of
the
individual
canal
it
is
difficult
to
know
to
which
to
allot
the
palm
for
oddity
circle
directness
excessive
length
want
of
width
or
striking
uniformity
each
is
so
anomalously
unnatural
as
to
have
received
the
approving
stamp
of
incredulity

wonderful

it

as
some
misrepresentation
has
been
made
on
this
subject
through
misapprehension
of
the
writer

observations
on

mercury
it
may
be
well
to
state
that
the
tenuous
markings
on
both

entirely
lack
the
unnatural
regularity
distinguishing

the

by
those

have
not

have
misapprehended
their
character
and

their
system
much
more
stands
beyond
for
outdoing
in
suggestiveness
the
individual
traits
of
the
lines
is
the
relation
shown
by
them
to
one
another
it
is
the
communal
characteristics
of
the
phenomenon
that
are
most
surprising
the
individual
peculiarities
of
the
lines
impress
themselves
at
once
the
communal
only
as
the
result
of
experience
collation
and
thought
as
the
observer
becomes
trained
the
more
lines
he
is
able
to
make
out
until
they
fairly
seam
the
whole
surface
of
the
light
areas
of
the
planet
their
name
collectively
is
legion
while
to
name
them
individually
is
fast
getting
for
the
number
detected
to
be
impossible
as
with
the
increasing
family
of
asteroids
figures
alone
will
prove
adequate
to
the
task
interdependence
not
independence
marks
the
attitude
of
the
canals
each
not
only
proceeds
with
absolute
directness
from
one
point
to
another
but
at
its
terminals
it
meets
canals
which
have
come
there
with
like
forthrightness
from
other
far
places
upon
the
planet
nor
is
it
two
only
that
thus
come
together
at
a
common
junction
three
four
five
to
as
many
as
fourteen
make
rendezvous
and
it
is
a
poor
junction
that
can
not
show
at
least
six
or
seven
the
result
is
a
network
which
triangulates
the
surface
of
the
planet
like
a
geodetic
survey
into
polygons
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
the
arian
areolas
the
size
of
the
pieces
forming
this
tesselate
ground
depends
solely
upon
the
fineness
of
the
definition
with
every
increase
in
the
power
of
seeing
each
areola
is
cut
into
still
smaller
portions
usually
by
connection
between
its
corners
thus
a
polygon
or
rhombus
is
split
into
triangles
which
may
themselves
be
divided
in
like
manner
the
mosaic
breaking
into
bits
the
sides
of
which
however
always
remain
from
this
arrangement
it
is
at
once
evident
that
the
canals
are
not
fortuitously
placed
that
lines
should
thus
meet
exactly
and
in
numbers
at
particular
points
and
only
there
shows
that
their
locating
is
not
the
outcome
of
chance
if
very
thin
rods
be
thrown
haphazard
over
a
surface
the
probability
that
more
than
two
will
cross
at
the
same
point
is
vanishingly
small
increasingly
assured
is
it
that
this
would
not
happen
generally
the
result
we
see
is
therefore
not
a
matter
of
chance
but
of
some
law
working
to
that
end
to
the
detection
of
what
that
law
is
precedes
the
easier
ascertainment
of
what
it
is
not
the
lines
for
example
can
not
be
rivers
which
was
the
first
explanation
offered
of
them
by
proctor
many
years
ago
because
of
their
peculiar
straightness
nor
can
they
be
channels
the
name
given
to
them
by
schiaparelli
except
in
the
sense
in
which
he
used
the
term
for
here
again
their
geometric
regularity
is
bar
to
any
hypothesis
for
quite
another
reason
they
can
not
be
cracks
because
of
their
uniform
size
throughout
their
unbroken
character
is
another
fatal
objection
to
the
same
suggestion
for
cracks
in
ground
never
pursue
for
any
great
distance
a
continuous
course
any
more
than
they
keep
uniform
or
straight
the
state
of
an
old
ceiling
is
a
case
in
point
when
it
breaks
it
does
so
in
fissures
that
proceed
a
certain
way
then
give
out
to
be
continued
by
others
roughly
parallel
to
the
first
but
parted
from
them
the
same
character
is
shown
by
the
rills
on
the
moon
the
straight
wall
so
called
is
composed
of
three
such
sections
and
the
little
rill
to
the
right
of
it
west
of
birt
of
four
thus
were
they
seen
at
flagstaff
and
as
to
the
writer
s
knowledge
they
have
not
been
so
depicted
elsewhere
the
fact
may
serve
to
give
some
idea
of
the
definition
there
that
the
underlying
cause
is
not
explosion
or
contraction
is
also
evidenced
by
the
canals
collectively
as
well
as
individually
their
arrangement
into
a
system
for
cracks
however
produced
could
only
originate
from
certain
centres
and
could
not
fit
into
those
starting
from
others
as
the
canals
invariably
do
for
each
canal
goes
as
undeviatingly
to
one
terminal
as
it
left
forthrightly
from
another
if
one
wishes
to
see
what
explosion
or
contraction
can
do
he
has
only
to
look
at
the
moon
through
an
when
he
will
be
shown
a
very
different
sight
from
what
the
drawings
of
mars
detail
thus
just
as
considered
individually
the
lines
can
not
be
watercourses
because
of
their
straightness
so
they
can
not
be
cracks
because
of
dovetailing
into
one
another
the
fact
that
they
form
a
system
shows
that
whatever
caused
them
operated
over
the
whole
planet
linked
in
cause
as
in
effect
throughout
each
section
this
at
once
negatives
any
purely
physical
cause
of
which
we
have
cognizance
for
upon
a
globe
still
so
subject
to
physical
vicissitude
as
mars
by
its
aspect
shows
itself
to
be
latitude
must
tell
in
the
phenomena
its
zones
exhibit
polar
snows
that
wax
and
wane
speak
of
arctic
conditions
very
diverse
from
temperate
and
tropic
states
and
what
would
affect
the
one
could
not
influence
the
other
yet
the
mesh
rises
superior
to
zonal
solicitation
as
to
local
barrier
it
is
not
something
dependent
either
on
the
temperament
or
the
complexion
of
the
globe
s
different
parts
it
transcends
surface
restriction
and
becomes
in
its
working
the
importance
of
this
omnipresence
dilates
in
meaning
as
one
dwells
in
thought
upon
it
ubiquitous
as
it
is
the
mesh
which
thus
covers
the
martian
surface
like
a
veil
spread
completely
over
it
is
unlike
a
veil
in
being
of
irregular
texture
not
only
are
the
interstices
of
various
shape
and
pattern
but
the
mesh
itself
is
of
locally
differing
size
though
the
threads
are
straight
and
uniform
throughout
they
are
not
all
alike
besides
being
unsymmetrically
interwoven
some
are
at
least
of
ten
times
the
coarseness
of
others
and
from
this
fact
and
the
effect
of
our
air
waves
all
are
not
visible
at
once
in
consequence
the
network
is
not
so
impressive
at
first
glance
as
it
becomes
upon
a
synthesis
of
the
observations
when
this
is
done
the
surface
proves
to
be
fairly
evenly
cut
up
as
recourse
to
the
maps
printed
in
this
volume
will
amply
demonstrate
these
maps
as
on
page
are
made
from
the
results
of
but
one
opposition
and
as
at
each
opposition
some
zone
is
in
a
more
state
than
others
owing
to
the
martian
season
at
the
time
a
still
greater
uniformity
in
canal
distribution
results
from
a
blending
of
many
from
the
completeness
of
the
mesh
it
follows
that
in
the
course
taken
severally
by
the
canals
no
one
direction
preponderates
over
another
considered
by
and
large
the
canals
seem
to
be
equally
distributed
round
the
compass
points
and
this
at
all
longitudes
and
nearly
all
latitudes
tropic
temperate
and
even
arctic
canals
show
a
pleasing
impartiality
in
the
matter
of
the
course
pursued
the
only
exceptions
occur
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
pole
there
a
slight
tendency
may
be
seen
to
a
north
and
south
setting
though
so
much
is
visible
in
a
general
way
from
the
map
it
is
of
interest
to
go
into
the
subject
with
more
particularity
and
to
that
end
to
show
it
statistically
the
several
canals
traversing
each
zone
were
therefore
counted
and
the
area
of
the
zone
computed
the
manner
of
canal
distribution
thus
found
is
given
in
the
following
table
in
the
second
column
of
which
stand
the
areas
of
the
several
zones
upon
the
planet
each
ten
degrees
wide
except
the
one
next
the
snow
and
in
the
third
the
number
of
canals
found
traversing
them
reduced
to
percentages
of
the
zone
a
fourth
column
shows
the
total
length
of
the
canals
in
each
zone
those
from
to
being
taken
from
the
globe
those
from
to
from
the
this
is
in
order
to
annul
the
effect
of
the
seasons
upon
the
showing
of
the
canals
as
much
as
possible
zone
area
no
of
canals
actual
length
wtd
the
numbers
continue
fairly
until
we
begin
to
approach
the
pole
when
they
commence
to
increase
much
the
same
result
is
got
if
we
take
the
actual
in
each
zone
as
the
fourth
column
shows
the
crowding
of
the
canals
poleward
is
marked
the
canals
therefore
are
phenomena
that
stand
in
peculiar
relationship
to
the
polar
cap
this
corroborates
the
inference
about
them
due
to
their
running
out
of
the
edge
of
the
snow
they
not
only
emanate
from
it
but
they
do
so
in
numbers
surpassing
what
is
elsewhere
observable
over
the
disk
otherwise
is
it
with
their
these
are
not
scattered
haphazard
over
the
surface
but
bear
to
its
general
features
definite
relations
if
we
consider
the
map
obliterating
the
lines
and
then
seek
to
connect
the
most
salient
points
of
the
planet
s
topography
by
direct
avenues
of
communication
we
shall
find
that
our
putative
lines
fall
exactly
where
the
real
ones
occur
for
the
most
part
the
real
lines
emanate
from
indentations
in
the
dark
regions
fitted
by
natural
position
for
what
if
these
were
seas
we
should
call
their
most
conspicuous
bays
they
thus
leave
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
deeper
folds
of
the
great
diaphragm
for
the
most
part
though
on
occasion
they
run
out
of
them
where
they
will
from
equally
conspicuous
points
in
the
dark
northern
areas
other
lines
proceed
while
in
the
centre
of
the
continents
the
canals
make
for
more
or
less
salient
spots
small
patches
of
shading
like
the
trivium
or
the
wedge
of
casius
or
simply
round
black
radiants
like
the
luci
ismenii
from
this
it
appears
that
the
lines
are
locally
dependent
upon
the
general
topography
of
the
fundamental
features
of
the
surface
for
some
reason
they
connect
the
very
points
most
suggestive
of
intercommunication
as
from
their
characteristics
it
is
perfectly
evident
that
the
lines
are
neither
rivers
nor
cracks
it
follows
that
such
a
communicating
habit
is
of
the
most
telltale
character
to
be
so
dissimilar
in
kind
from
the
main
markings
and
yet
so
dependent
upon
them
hints
that
their
positioning
occurred
after
the
formation
of
the
main
features
themselves
we
reach
thus
from
the
look
of
the
lines
and
their
location
a
most
striking
deduction
that
the
lines
are
not
coeval
with
the
main
markings
but
have
come
into
being
later
and
with
reference
to
the
general
topography
of
the
planet
the
network
is
not
only
a
mesh
then
but
one
which
subsequent
to
the
fashioning
of
the
seas
and
continents
and
what
these
have
now
become
has
been
superposed
upon
them
chapter
xvii
gemination
of
the
canals
fraught
with
more
difficulty
than
the
detection
of
the
lines
alone
is
the
next
discovery
made
upon
the
disk
the
recognition
of
pairs
of
lines
traversing
it
in
while
schiaparelli
was
engaged
in
scrutinizing
the
strange
he
had
discovered
on
the
planet
the
opposition
before
he
was
suddenly
surprised
to
mark
one
of
them
double
two
closely
parallel
lines
confronted
him
where
but
a
single
one
had
previously
stood
so
unaccountable
did
the
sight
seem
that
he
hesitated
to
credit
what
he
saw
being
minded
to
attribute
the
vision
to
illusion
of
some
sort
and
the
more
so
that
it
was
not
renewed
while
he
was
still
wondering
what
it
meant
the
planet
parted
company
with
the
earth
carrying
its
enigma
with
it
when
the
two
bodies
again
drew
near
to
one
another
in
schiaparelli
set
himself
to
watch
for
a
recurrence
of
the
strange
phenomenon
before
long
it
came
and
more
bewilderingly
than
at
first
for
not
one
canal
alone
but
a
score
of
them
now
showed
in
duplicate
each
presenting
to
his
astonished
gaze
twin
lines
perfectly
matched
and
preserving
throughout
their
distance
apart
suspecting
diplopia
or
some
other
optical
trick
he
tried
various
eyepieces
to
a
test
of
the
cause
but
to
no
change
in
the
effect
the
twin
lines
continued
visible
do
what
he
would
insisting
on
their
own
reality
in
spite
of
all
solicitation
to
merge
how
cautious
he
was
in
the
matter
and
how
unwilling
at
first
to
believe
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
is
shown
by
the
care
he
took
to
guard
against
deception
it
was
not
until
he
had
assured
himself
of
the
reality
of
the
phenomena
that
he
believed
what
he
had
seen
it
so
chanced
that
my
first
experience
of
the
thing
was
almost
equally
startling
so
unexpected
was
it
and
so
exceedingly
sharp
was
the
definition
at
the
time
it
was
in
an
autumn
early
twilight
through
air
almost
perfectly
still
as
the
light
went
out
of
the
sky
and
the
markings
on
the
planet
began
to
come
forth
that
the
phison
of
a
sudden
showed
in
duplicate
to
me
upon
the
disk
its
twin
lines
like
the
rails
of
a
railway
track
traversing
aeria
not
more
vivid
do
those
of
our
transcontinental
tracks
appear
as
one
sees
them
stretching
off
into
the
distance
upon
our
western
plains
more
impressive
was
the
sight
from
the
fact
that
i
was
not
looking
for
it
it
simply
suddenly
stood
forth
this
strange
parallelism
of
pencil
lines
my
surprise
matched
the
wonder
of
the
sight
since
then
i
have
witnessed
it
several
hundred
times
but
never
with
more
absolute
certainty
than
at
that
first
fortunate
revelation
to
this
distinctness
is
due
the
amazement
it
then
aroused
not
simply
because
of
its
surpassing
novelty
but
for
the
insistence
with
which
it
proclaimed
itself
was
the
effect
to
be
ascribed
less
well
seen
doubt
had
robbed
it
of
its
full
surprise
it
requires
as
a
rule
steady
definition
for
its
initial
unmistakable
showing
if
one
would
be
instantly
convinced
except
for
such
it
is
not
usually
easy
to
the
unpracticed
though
often
discernible
to
the
expert
after
it
has
once
been
seen
but
that
it
is
real
no
one
who
had
had
a
good
view
of
the
sight
could
doubt
still
less
after
the
experience
had
been
repeated
over
and
over
again
what
appears
to
take
place
is
this
where
previously
a
single
line
joined
two
points
upon
the
disk
twin
lines
the
one
the
replica
of
the
other
stand
forth
in
its
stead
the
two
lines
of
the
pair
are
but
a
short
distance
apart
are
of
the
same
size
of
the
same
length
and
absolutely
equidistant
throughout
their
course
it
is
as
if
a
second
line
had
in
some
way
been
mysteriously
added
to
the
first
since
the
latter
was
last
seen
some
weeks
before
this
in
a
word
is
the
phenomenon
technically
called
the
gemination
of
the
canals
which
has
since
its
discovery
called
forth
so
much
comment
it
is
not
in
reality
quite
as
simple
or
as
sudden
as
it
seems
but
this
was
the
way
in
which
the
phenomenon
was
first
seen
and
in
which
it
still
continues
to
be
criticised
of
reality
the
double
lines
are
patently
objective
to
him
who
is
fortunate
enough
to
see
them
well
nevertheless
the
great
difficulty
of
detecting
them
and
the
still
greater
difficulty
of
conceiving
how
such
things
can
be
has
led
many
not
versed
in
the
subject
to
disbelieve
and
from
that
to
attempt
to
explain
the
sight
as
illusory
scepticism
seeks
what
is
hard
of
acceptance
for
its
strangeness
begetting
hypotheses
of
committed
error
which
find
easy
credence
for
their
comforting
conservatism
several
such
have
in
consequence
been
propounded
to
account
for
the
double
canals
there
is
the
diplopic
theory
which
credits
them
to
the
interferential
theory
which
would
make
them
optical
products
of
the
telescope
and
the
illusion
theory
which
would
have
them
quite
simply
imaginary
inasmuch
as
in
any
research
the
assurance
that
a
phenomenon
is
real
is
the
first
point
about
it
to
be
established
it
is
a
scientist
s
duty
not
only
to
scan
the
phenomena
with
jealous
care
to
that
end
but
to
scrutinize
every
theory
which
would
seek
otherwise
to
account
for
testing
such
being
only
second
in
importance
to
observing
the
things
themselves
accordingly
i
have
examined
each
of
the
optical
theories
that
have
been
advanced
and
critically
compared
what
they
assert
and
require
with
the
results
of
observation
the
outcome
of
this
research
has
proved
as
negativing
to
any
other
origin
for
the
double
canals
than
reality
as
direct
observations
at
the
telescope
are
positive
on
the
point
to
show
this
i
shall
review
each
in
its
consequences
confronting
it
with
what
the
telescope
has
to
say
on
the
subject
for
it
is
of
the
pith
of
the
matter
that
the
reality
should
be
as
demonstrable
on
demand
as
on
sight
furthermore
i
shall
do
this
before
embarking
on
the
general
account
of
these
strange
things
because
it
is
vital
to
any
interest
that
one
should
be
assured
from
the
start
of
the
truth
of
what
he
is
to
read
the
preface
may
seem
to
him
abstruse
and
prosy
but
it
will
introduce
him
to
some
curious
optical
properties
and
will
eventually
enhance
his
concern
by
proving
to
him
that
what
reads
like
fiction
is
all
the
more
wonderful
for
being
fact
the
diplopic
diplopia
is
the
property
of
seeing
double
with
one
eye
surprising
as
it
sounds
it
is
an
effect
not
unknown
to
students
of
optics
though
it
usually
requires
training
to
produce
it
is
possible
only
when
the
eye
is
not
focused
on
the
object
and
is
not
always
possible
then
from
my
experiments
its
feasibility
seems
to
depend
upon
whether
the
focus
be
beyond
or
before
what
it
should
be
if
the
eye
be
focused
for
a
point
beyond
the
object
the
object
is
doubled
if
for
a
point
this
side
of
it
the
latter
is
simply
blurred
when
the
double
is
formed
the
amount
of
the
separation
of
the
two
images
is
a
function
of
the
distance
the
focus
is
out
the
greater
the
discrepancy
the
wider
apart
is
the
ensuing
double
nor
does
the
image
of
a
line
for
example
stop
at
doubling
after
a
certain
breadth
of
separation
is
reached
a
third
line
appears
bisecting
the
interval
between
the
other
two
with
yet
greater
widening
the
third
line
itself
splits
into
a
pair
and
so
the
resolution
goes
on
in
my
own
experiments
i
have
gone
so
far
as
to
suspect
a
fifth
line
far
from
being
unconscious
the
process
of
producing
the
phenomenon
is
with
some
people
of
difficult
accomplishment
lampland
for
instance
of
the
flagstaff
observatory
to
whom
we
owe
the
first
photographing
of
the
canals
and
who
sees
the
doubles
of
mars
without
difficulty
has
hitherto
found
diplopic
vision
an
impossible
feat
even
with
the
most
practiced
diplopia
is
never
unconscious
except
when
the
object
viewed
as
a
micrometer
wire
has
nothing
to
locate
it
in
space
now
the
diplopic
theory
of
the
double
canals
supposes
that
in
all
cases
the
eye
of
the
observer
is
thus
unconsciously
out
of
focus
to
this
method
of
their
manufacture
the
telescopic
phenomena
prove
unamenable
on
five
counts
focusing
the
eye
on
an
object
is
now
a
reflex
action
so
automatic
has
it
become
in
consequence
one
is
commonly
directly
conscious
when
an
object
is
not
in
focus
always
so
when
the
object
presents
detail
were
such
not
the
case
we
should
never
except
by
chance
see
anything
defined
observing
through
a
telescope
after
a
modicum
of
practice
differs
in
no
respect
from
observing
in
everyday
life
consequently
that
an
experienced
observer
should
not
know
his
business
in
so
primary
a
matter
is
preposterous
one
may
or
may
not
believe
that
the
undevout
astronomer
is
mad
but
that
the
perpetually
unfocused
one
would
be
is
beyond
debate
generically
unlikely
the
failure
to
focus
is
here
specifically
out
of
the
question
for
the
observer
does
not
use
the
canals
to
focus
on
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
can
not
like
all
delicate
detail
the
doubles
appear
not
continuously
but
by
flashes
of
revelation
according
as
the
atmospheric
waves
permit
of
passage
undisturbed
to
focus
on
them
would
be
next
to
impossible
even
were
it
resorted
it
never
is
by
the
exponents
of
the
theory
this
important
fact
is
overlooked
the
unforeseen
showing
of
the
canals
and
therefore
the
absolute
lack
of
complicity
of
the
eye
in
the
matter
what
one
focuses
on
is
the
look
of
the
main
markings
of
the
disk
now
to
suppose
an
observer
systematically
out
in
his
perceptions
of
so
featureful
a
planet
as
that
of
mars
so
that
he
does
not
know
when
he
sees
its
image
sharp
implies
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
astronomic
observation
in
the
supposer
study
by
the
writer
shows
the
width
of
a
given
double
canal
to
be
constant
for
a
given
date
within
the
errors
of
perception
or
recording
the
twin
lines
are
always
at
the
same
epoch
the
same
distance
apart
the
greater
the
number
of
determinations
made
the
nearer
the
result
approaches
to
this
mean
and
the
greater
the
care
used
in
delineation
the
less
each
value
departs
from
it
now
if
the
thing
were
a
matter
of
mistaken
focusing
an
eye
could
not
be
thus
true
to
its
own
mistakes
if
it
were
out
in
its
focus
by
a
certain
amount
at
one
time
it
would
be
likely
to
be
out
by
a
different
amount
at
another
so
that
by
the
very
terms
of
its
making
a
diplopic
double
would
be
sure
to
vary
indeed
in
laboratory
experiments
it
is
impossible
to
prevent
it
for
the
eye
rests
itself
automatically
by
change
of
focus
and
if
it
be
not
consciously
kept
awry
it
reverts
as
near
to
the
true
focus
as
it
can
of
its
own
accord
diplopia
might
be
a
respecter
of
persons
but
it
certainly
could
not
be
one
of
canals
for
a
given
observer
it
must
be
objectively
general
in
its
application
to
the
same
class
of
objects
consequently
if
the
doubling
were
diplopic
all
canals
inclined
at
the
same
angle
to
the
the
tilt
might
affect
the
result
were
the
eye
be
similarly
affected
parallel
canals
should
parallel
each
other
s
action
with
the
martian
doubles
this
is
not
the
case
of
two
canals
similarly
inclined
the
one
will
be
double
the
other
not
at
the
same
instant
and
under
conditions
that
are
alike
and
this
persistently
for
gemination
is
an
attribute
of
certain
canals
and
never
of
others
at
a
given
season
of
the
martian
year
some
canals
are
regularly
double
some
invariably
single
night
after
night
and
presentation
after
presentation
these
idiosyncrasies
are
preserved
the
doubles
always
pairs
the
single
always
alone
nor
does
the
strength
of
the
line
affect
the
action
the
single
canals
are
some
of
them
stronger
some
of
them
weaker
than
the
doubles
seen
at
the
same
time
if
of
diplopic
origin
the
mean
width
of
all
the
doubles
should
be
the
same
for
though
the
diplopic
width
would
vary
for
a
given
canal
according
to
the
moment
a
sufficient
number
of
views
would
yield
a
mean
width
which
would
be
the
same
for
all
tilt
apart
the
mean
width
of
one
canal
would
be
that
of
another
among
martian
doubles
on
the
contrary
i
have
found
the
width
to
be
a
specific
property
of
the
particular
canal
each
has
its
own
mean
width
regardless
of
inclination
and
this
individual
width
differs
as
between
one
and
another
by
as
much
as
five
to
two
or
if
we
consider
such
canals
as
the
nilokeras
i
and
ii
by
more
than
ten
to
two
any
one
of
these
five
points
is
fatal
to
the
theory
all
the
interference
from
the
wave
propagation
of
light
it
follows
that
the
image
of
a
bright
line
made
by
a
lens
is
not
itself
a
simple
bright
line
but
a
bright
band
flanked
by
alternate
dark
and
bright
ones
it
has
therefore
been
suggested
that
a
bright
medial
line
is
here
concerned
and
that
the
double
canal
is
the
first
of
its
dark
pair
of
outriders
but
the
suggestion
does
not
bear
scrutiny
it
presupposes
a
central
streak
brighter
than
the
rest
of
the
disk
to
give
birth
to
the
twin
dark
lines
this
should
itself
be
visible
in
the
image
but
no
such
bright
backbone
is
seen
it
demands
a
perfectly
definite
width
of
separation
for
a
given
is
not
that
observed
it
makes
the
width
a
function
of
the
aperture
decreasing
as
this
is
not
sustained
by
observation
different
apertures
produce
no
effect
on
the
widths
of
the
martian
doubles
as
the
writer
has
shown
lowell
observatory
bulletin
no
by
a
change
of
aperture
from
to
six
inches
under
like
optical
conditions
the
optically
produced
doubles
would
be
all
of
a
width
while
the
martian
ones
show
idiosyncratic
widths
each
peculiar
to
itself
the
illusion
known
also
as
the
small
boy
theory
from
the
ingenuous
simplicity
on
which
it
rests
this
theory
attacks
the
reality
of
the
doubles
by
questioning
that
of
the
canals
because
some
boys
from
the
greenwich
reform
or
charity
school
set
to
copy
a
picture
of
the
planet
themselves
supplied
the
lines
which
had
preceptorily
been
left
out
the
martian
canals
have
been
denied
existence
which
is
like
saying
that
because
a
man
may
see
stars
without
scanning
the
heavens
therefore
those
in
the
sky
do
not
exist
as
to
the
instructions
the
boys
received
we
are
left
in
the
dark
it
looks
as
if
some
leading
questions
had
unconsciously
been
put
to
them
at
all
events
english
charity
boys
would
seem
to
be
particularly
pliant
to
such
imagination
for
when
flammarion
retried
the
experiment
with
french
schoolboys
and
even
inserted
spaced
dots
for
the
canals
in
the
copy
not
a
boy
of
them
drew
an
illusory
line
the
fact
is
this
is
one
of
those
deceptive
which
is
so
much
more
deleterious
than
an
unmitigated
mistake
under
certain
circumstances
it
is
quite
possible
to
perceive
illusory
lines
due
either
to
shadings
otherwise
unmarked
and
thus
synthesized
or
to
immediately
precedent
retinal
impressions
transferred
to
places
where
they
do
not
belong
by
rapid
motion
of
the
eye
as
i
had
myself
discovered
before
the
english
experiment
had
been
tried
but
as
i
have
also
found
out
these
effects
are
produced
only
at
the
limit
of
vision
and
in
that
limbo
of
uncertainty
the
whole
art
of
the
observer
consists
in
learning
to
distinguish
the
true
from
the
false
strength
of
impression
renewed
effect
and
a
peculiar
sense
of
reality
or
the
reverse
enable
him
to
adjudge
the
two
more
experience
than
the
boys
possessed
would
have
helped
them
to
part
the
sheep
from
the
goats
but
furthermore
and
fatally
to
the
theory
here
in
question
the
martian
canals
when
well
seen
are
not
at
the
limit
of
vision
as
its
framers
supposed
but
well
within
that
boundary
of
doubt
so
that
the
premise
upon
which
the
whole
theory
rests
gives
way
under
good
atmospheric
conditions
the
canals
are
comparable
for
conspicuousness
to
many
of
the
fraunhofer
lines
and
are
just
as
certainly
there
thus
each
attempt
to
prove
the
doubles
turns
out
when
specifically
examined
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
facts
with
the
assurance
of
their
reality
thus
made
doubly
sure
we
pass
to
consideration
of
the
things
themselves
chapter
xviii
the
double
canals
i
rightly
viewed
no
more
subtle
tribute
could
be
paid
to
the
remarkable
character
of
the
phenomenon
of
gemination
than
the
scepticism
with
which
it
was
immediately
received
and
which
it
still
continues
to
elicit
that
the
sight
should
be
regarded
as
illusory
speaks
for
its
surpassing
strangeness
and
so
far
as
oddity
goes
the
encomium
is
certainly
deserved
of
the
bizarre
features
of
this
curiously
marked
disk
the
double
canals
were
at
the
time
of
their
discovery
the
culmination
and
though
things
stranger
still
if
possible
have
since
been
seen
there
it
is
not
wonderful
that
doubt
should
still
incredulously
stare
if
the
mere
account
of
them
reads
like
romance
to
see
them
is
an
experience
nothing
astronomical
that
i
have
ever
seen
has
been
so
startlingly
impressive
as
my
first
view
of
a
double
canal
even
in
narration
the
thing
justifies
its
effect
for
a
double
canal
consists
of
a
pair
of
twin
dark
filaments
perfectly
parallel
throughout
their
course
and
inclosing
between
them
ground
of
the
same
ochreish
cast
as
that
which
lies
without
only
on
occasion
is
this
tint
of
their
midway
departed
from
and
then
only
toward
a
darkening
never
toward
a
lightening
of
it
except
for
appearing
paired
the
lines
resemble
precisely
the
usual
single
canals
in
length
they
vary
from
a
few
hundred
to
a
few
thousand
miles
while
in
width
each
component
for
narrowness
hardly
permits
of
definite
ascription
compared
for
strength
with
the
usual
canal
the
lines
of
a
double
seem
to
hold
on
the
average
an
intermediate
position
between
the
larger
and
the
smaller
of
the
single
canals
so
far
detected
owing
however
to
the
massed
effect
of
the
pair
by
reason
of
their
closeness
they
have
an
advantage
in
showing
over
the
singles
of
two
to
one
and
this
renders
them
among
the
most
conspicuous
and
important
meshes
of
the
canal
network
like
the
single
canals
they
vary
in
strength
with
the
martian
time
of
year
at
certain
seasons
developing
into
heavy
pencil
lines
and
at
others
fading
away
to
the
merest
gossamers
only
just
discernible
like
cobwebs
stretched
across
the
face
of
the
planet
although
the
individual
constituent
lines
vary
in
aspect
and
never
rise
at
their
most
to
cognizable
breadth
the
distance
parting
their
centres
or
the
width
of
the
double
is
quite
measurable
the
only
difficulty
in
the
way
of
its
determination
lies
in
the
absence
of
a
procurable
unit
small
enough
to
mete
it
the
usual
of
the
micrometer
are
colossal
in
comparison
with
these
filaments
and
present
a
standard
only
analogic
at
best
nevertheless
by
means
of
the
finest
threads
that
could
be
got
estimates
of
the
distance
between
the
pairs

made
at
flagstaff
in
and
the
results
agree
as
closely
as
the
means
permit
with
those
got
by
measurement
of
the
doubles
as
depicted
in
the
drawings

martian

of
what
they
look
like
the
following
illustrations
give
a
fair
idea
only
that
instead
of
being
more
geometrically
regular
in
the
drawing
than
in

the
fact
is
the
other
way
freehand

incapable
of

railway

could
be
laid
down
with
more
precision

to
their
size
the
following
figures
derived
from
a
typical
double
canal

give
some
conception
this
great
artery
of
intercommunication
between
the
sabaeus
sinus
and
the
nilosyrtis
is
roughly
speaking
miles
long
the
distance
between
the
centres
of
the
two
constituents
is
about
miles
and
each
line
is
perhaps
miles
in
breadth
when
at
its
maximum
strength
the
pair
follow
apparently
the
arc
of
a
great
circle
from
the
portus
sigaeus
on
the
mare
icarium
to
the
pseboas
lucus
in
latitude
north
the
portus

of
two
little
nicks
in
the
coastline
looking
like
the
carets
one
makes
in
checking
off

down
a

if
the
space
between
the
down
and
up

were
then
filled
in
the

on
the
other
hand
is
a
large
round
dot
like
a
small
ink
spot
to
these
two
differently
appearing

the
twin
lines
of
the
phison
behave
differently
while
each
line
leaves
centrally
its
own
caret
of
the
portus
sigaeus
at
the
south
at
the
north
each
touches
peripherally
the
pseboas

the

west
sides

the

its

stroke
all

ii
now
the
first
point
to
be
noticed
about
the
doubles
is
that
bilateralism
or
the
quality
of
being
double
is
not
a
universal
trait
of
the
canals
either
actually
or
potentially
it
is
not
even
a
general
one
out
of
the
four
hundred
canals
seen
at
flagstaff
only
have
at
any
time
displayed
the
quality
that
is
one
eighth
roughly
of
the
whole
number
observed
this
point
is
most
important
for
the
fact
is
of
itself
enough
to
disprove
any
optical
origin
for
the
phenomenon
the
characteristic
of
doubling
so
confidently
ascribed
by
those
who
have
not
seen
it
to
general
optical
or
ocular
principles
proves
thus
the
exception
not
the
rule
with
the
canals
and
by
so
doing
disowns
the
applicability
of
any
merely
optical
solution
we
shall
encounter
many
more
equally
prohibitive
bars
to
illusory
explanation
before
we
have
done
with
the
doubles
but
it
is
interesting
to
meet
one
in
this
manner
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
subject
on
the
other
hand
the
characteristic
when
possessed
is
persistent
in
the
particular
canal
if
not
once
shown
by
a
canal
that
canal
may
confidently
be
looked
to
at
a
proper
time
to
disclose
it
again
in
short
bilateralism
or
the
state
of
being
dual
is
an
inherent
attribute
of
the
individual
canal
as
idiosyncratic

and

of
canals
possessing
this
property

they

in
spite
of
possessing
the
property
of
pairing
a
canal
may
not
always
exhibit
it
to
the
production
of
the
phenomenon
the
proper
time
is
as
essential
as
the
property
itself
so
far
as
a
primary
scanning
or
first
approximation
is
capable
of
revealing
a
canal
will
be
single
at
one
martian
season
and
double
at
another
thus
these
canals
alternated
in
their
state
to
schiaparelli
and
for
the
earlier
of
his
own
observed
oppositions
to
the
writer
in
consequence
schiaparelli
deemed
gemination
a
process
which
the
canal
periodically
underwent
three
stages
in
the
development
were
to
him
distinguishable
the
single
aspect
a
short
confused
aspect
and
the
clearly
dual
one
in
the
single
state
the
canal
remained
most
of
the
time
it
then
underwent
a
chrysalid
stage
of
confusion
to
emerge
of
a
sudden
into
a
perfect
pair
furthermore
he
noted
the
times
at
which
the
pairing
took
place
to
the
formulating
of
a
law
in
the
from
the
observations
of
more
than
one
opposition
his
law
was
that
the
gemination
occurred
on
the
average
three
months
ours
after
the
summer
solstice
of
the
northern
hemisphere
lasted
four
to
five
months
then
faded
out
to
begin
afresh
one
month
after
the
vernal
equinox
of
the
same
hemisphere
and
continue
for
four
months
more
expressed
in
martian
seasonal
chronology
the
periods
would
be
about
half
as
long
at
certain
times
then
the
most
pronounced
specimens
of
doubles
showed
obstinately
single
while
the
periodic
metamorphosis
that
transformed
them
into
duplicates
was
timed
to
the
changes
of
the
planet
s
year
gemination
then
was
a
seasonal
phenomenon
advance
in
our
knowledge
of
the
phenomenon
since
schiaparelli
s
time
while
still
showing
the
thing
to
be
of
seasonal
habit
has
changed
our
conception
of
it
it
now
appears
that
in
some
cases
certainly
and
possibly
in
all
the
dual
aspect
is
not
a
temporary
condition
but
the
differing
pronouncement
of
a
permanent
state
the
fact
of
gemination
so
called
being
confined
to
a
filling
out
of
what
is
always
skeletonly
there
as
the
canals
have
come
to
be
better
seen
the
three
stages
of
existence
have
in
some
cases
become
recognizable
as
only
different
degrees
in
discernment
of
an
essential
double
condition
the
single
appearance
being
due
to
the
relative
feebleness
of
one
of
the
constituents
and
the
confused
showing
to
the
weakness
of
both
which
are
then
the
more
easily
blurred
by
the
air
waves
in
certain
canals
the
last
few
oppositions
and
have
disclosed
this
unmistakably
to
be
the
case
as
with
the
phison
and
euphrates
for
example
with
them
the
double
character
has
been
continuously
visible
appearing
not
only
when
by
schiaparelli
s
law
it
should
but
at
the
times
when
it
should
not
only
on
these
latter
occasions
it
was
harder
to
see
whence
the
reason
it
was
previously
missed
so
that
further
scrutiny
while
in
no
sense
discrediting
the
earlier
observations
has
extended
to
them
some
modification
and
disclosed
the
underlying
truth
to
be
the
varying
visibility
the
thing
itself
except
for
strength
in
part
or
whole
persisting
the
same
improvement
in
definition
has
lowered
the
to
revelation
of
continuous
presence
of
the
dual
state
it
is
only
on
occasion
that
the
improvement
is
sufficient
for
the
thing
when
at
its
feeblest
to
loom
thus
above
the
horizon
of
certainty
yet
at
such
moments
of
a
rise
in
the
seeing
it
is
enough
to
allow
it
to
be
glimpsed
thus
it
fared
with
the
adamas
at
the
opposition
of
with
the
gigas
and
with
many
another
in
years
gone
by
separation
has
come
with
training
and
generally
in
the
case
of
the
wider
doubles
which
leads
one
to
infer
that
ease
of
resolution
is
largely
responsible
for
assurance
of
the
permanency
of
the
dual
state
perplexing
exceptions
however
remain
so
that
it
is
possible
at
present
only
to
predicate
the
principal
of
most
of
the
double
canals
but
not
of
all
leaving
the
exceptions
out
of
account
for
the
moment
we
pass
to
those
general
characteristics
which
are
intimately
linked
with
what
has
just
been
said
inasmuch
as
the
act
of
getting
into
a
state
antedates
the
fact
of
being
there
it
is
logical
to
let
the
description
of
the
first
precede
an
account
of
the
process
of
gemination
may
thus
suitably
come
before
that
of
its
result
flux
affecting
the
double
canals
in
whole
or
part
is
the
cause
of
the
apparent
gemination
according
as
the
flux
is
partitive
or
total
is
a
single
or
a
dual
state
produced
at
the
depth
of
its
inconspicuousness
the
canal
may
cease
to
be
visible
at
all
this
occurs
when
both
lines
fade
out
on
the
other
hand
the
one
line
may
outfade
the
other
and
we
are
presented
with
a
seemingly
single
canal
at
this
its
minimum
showing
in
such
seasons
of
debility
the
one
line
may
appear
and
the
other
not
or
occasionally
the
other
show
and
the
one
not
according
to
the
air
waves
of
the
moment
it
is
at
these
times
that
the
double
simulates
a
single
canal
and
unless
well
seen
and
carefully
watched
might
easily
masquerade
successfully
as
such
the
hiddekel
in
the
depth
of
its
dead
season
is
peculiarly
given
to
this
alternately
partitive
presentation
as
the
flux
comes
on
one
or
both
lines
feel
it
if
one
only
we
are
likely
to
have
a
confused
canal
if
both
a
difficult
double
the
strength
of
the
lines
increases
until
at
last
both
attain
their
maximum
and
the
canal
stands
revealed
an
unmistakable
pair
the
two
lines
paralleling
one
another
in
appearance
as
in
position
at
the
canal
s
maximum
and
minimum
the
equality
of
its
two
constituents
is
chiefly
to
be
remarked
though
it
occurs
on
other
occasions
as
well
but
what
is
significant
when
the
two
differ
it
is
always
the
same
one
that
outdoes
its
fellow
it
may
be
the
twin
in
one
pair
the
one
in
another
but
whichever
it
be
for
the
particular
canal
its
preëminence
is
invariable
it
is
this
canal
which
except
for
adventitious
help
or
hindrance
from
the
alone
shows
when
the
double
assumes
the
seemingly
single
state
we
may
therefore
call
it
the
original
canal
the
other
being
dubbed
the
duplicate
in
some
cases
it
has
been
possible
to
decide
which
is
which
it
might
seem
at
first
sight
as
if
this
point
should
always
be
ascertainable
but
the
determination
is
more
dilemmic
than
appears
not
from
any
difficulty
in
seeing
the
canal
but
from
the
absence
of
distinguishing
earmark
at
its
end
in
a
long
stretch
of
commonplace
coast
the
precise
point
of
embouchure
of
a
solitary
canal
can
not
be
so
certainly
fixed
as
to
be
decisive
later
between
two
which
show
close
together
in
the
same
locality
it
is
only
where
some
landmark
points
the
canal
s
terminal
that
the
problem
admits
of
definite
solution
this
telltale
tag
may
be
a
bay
like
the
margaritifer
sinus
or
double
gulfs
like
the
sabaeus
sinus
or
portions
of
a
marking
not
too
large
to
permit
of
partitive
location
like
the
mare
acidalium
or
a
canal
connection
like
the
tacazze
which
prolongs
the
one
line
and
not
the
other
in
these
and
similar
instances
the
two
lines
become
capable
of
identification

although
suspected
for

if

be

made
the
concordance
of
the
result
will
prove
striking
corroborative
as
it
is
of
both
for
the
necessary
observations
are
very
difficult
having
thus
realized
the
original
by
means
of
its
superior
showing
and
then
identified
it
by
its
position
it
is
suggestive
to
discover
that
the
duplicate
betrays
its
subordinate
character
not
only
by
its
relative
insignificance
but
by
its
secondary
position
as
well
the
original
always
takes
its
departure
from
some
bay
seemingly
designated
by
nature
as
a
or
from
a
caret
belonging
clearly
to
itself
the
adjunct
on
the
other
hand
leaves
from
some
neighboring
undistinguished
spot
as
in
the
case
of
the
additional
djihoun
or
makes
use
of
a
neighbor
s
caret
as
in
the
case
of
the
second
phison
and
the
supplementary
euphrates
in
either
case
it
plays
something
of
the
part
of
an
afterthought
and
yet
the
postscript
when
finished
reads
as
an
integral
part
of
the
letter
an
example
will
serve
to
make
the
connection
evident
while
leaving
the
character
of
the
connection
as
cryptic
as
ever
in
the
long
stretch
of
aerial
coastline
bounding
the
mare
icarium
which
sweeps
with
the
curve
of
a
foretime
beach
from
the
hammonis
cornu
to
the
tip
of
the
edom
promontory
there
stand
halfway
down
its
seeming
two
little
nicks
or
indentations
even
in
poor
seeing
they
serve
to
darken
this
part
of
the
coast
while
in
good
definition
they
come
out
as
miniature
bays
they
are
the
portus
sigaei
and
mark
the
spots
where
the
phison
and
the
euphrates
respectively
leave
the
coast
about
four
degrees
apart
the
eastern
makes
embouchure
to
the
original
phison
the
western
to
the
original
euphrates
and
each
in
some
mysterious
manner
is
associated
not
only
in
position
but
in
action
with
the
canal
itself
in
the
single
state
each
canal
leaves
the
mare
from
this
its
own
caret
the
phison
proceeding
thence
northeast
down
the
disk
the
euphrates
nearly
due
north
so
that
starting
four
degrees
apart
at
the
south
they
are
forty
degrees
asunder
at
their
northern
termini
clearly
at
these
latter
points
they
are
not
even
neighbors
and
except
for
the
accident
of
close
approach
at
their
other
ends
have
nothing
in
common
anywhere
and
yet
when
gemination
takes
place
a
curious
thing
occurs
each
borrows
its
neighbor
s
terminal
as
for
its
own
duplicate
canal
having
thus
got
its
base
the
replica
proceeds
to
parallel
its
own
original
canal
without
the
least
reference
to
the
other
canal
whose
own
caret
it
has
so
appropriated
what
the
phison
thus
does
to
the
euphrates
the
euphrates
returns
the
compliment
by
doing
to
the
phison
in
this
manner
is
produced
an
interrelation
which
suggests
without
necessarily
being
an
original
community
of
interest
suggests
it
on
its
face
and
yet
appears
to
be
rather
of
the
nature
of
an
adaptation
to
subsequent
purposes
of
a
something
aboriginally
there
illustration
of
euphrates
and
that
such
appropriation
is
the
fact
is
clearly
hinted
by
the
behavior
of
another
understudy
of
an
original
canal
in
this
case
the
duplicate
of
the
djihoun
which
in
consequence
of
the
position
of
its
original
finds
no
neighboring
embouchure
already
convenient
to
its
use
the
single
or
original
djihoun
leaves
the
tip
of
the
margaritifer
sinus
which
serves
a
like
end
to
the
oxus
and
the
indus
both
single
canals
the
sinus
is
itself
a
single
bay
and
so
large
that
for
many
degrees
its
shores
on
both
sides
converge
smoothly
to
their
sharp
apex
because
of
this
probably
the
coast
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
is
without
canal
connection
no
canal
being
known
along
either
side
till
one
reaches
the
hydraotes
at
the
aromaticum
promontorium
which
marks
the
western
limit
of
the
gulf
the
consequence
is
that
when
the
djihoun
doubles
the
duplicate
canal
not
having
any
terminus
ready
to
its
hand
has
to
make
one
for
itself
by
simply
running
into
the
margaritifer
sinus
some
distance
up
its
eastern
side
it
thus
advertises
its
adjunctival
character
and
at
the
same
time
the
general
fact
that
a
neighbor
s
terminus
though
used
from
preference
when
convenient
is
not
an
essential
in
the
process
gemination
occurs
of
its
own
initiative
but
is
conditioned
by
convenience
whether
one
canal
shows
thus
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
or
whether
both
stand
so
confused
as
not
to
be
told
apart
the
fact
remains
that
the
double
is
not
always
recognizable
as
such
if
we
turn
to
the
list
of
the
doubles
on
page
we
shall
note
that
the
same
canals
were
not
always
seen
in
the
dual
condition
at
successive
oppositions
some
indeed
are
so
emphatically
of
the
habit
as
to
appear
year
after
year
in
a
paired
state
but
others
are
not
so
constant
to
their
possibilities
now
when
it
is
remembered
that
at
different
oppositions
we
view
mars
at
diverse
seasons
of
its
tropical
year
we
see
that
this
means
that
the
phenomenon
is
seasonal
and
furthermore
that
its
exhibition
depends
upon
the
canal
s
position
gemination
like
the
showing
or
of
the
single
canal
is
conditioned
by
the
place
of
the
canal
upon
the
planet
iii
turning
from
such
generic
characteristics
to
more
specific
traits
the
first
thing
to
strike
an
attentive
observer
is
that
the
doubles
differ
in
width
that
they
are
not
mensurably
alike
in
the
property
they
hold
in
common
of
being
paired
in
some
the
twin
lines
are
obviously
farther
apart
than
in
others
and
the
relation
persists
however
repeated
the
observations
of
two
doubles
the
one
will
always
surpass
its
fellow
this
contrasted
individuality
first
struck
me
in
the
phison
and
the
euphrates
and
from
the
first
moment
at
which
these
doubles
showed
as
such
the
phison
pair
seemed
perceptibly
the
narrower
of
the
two
a
like
distinction
was
evident
at
the
next
opposition
and
the
next
in
fact
at
every
succeeding
one
to
the
present
day
nor
was
the
recognition
of
the
fact
confined
to
me
if
we
turn
to
schiaparelli
s
memoriae
we
shall
find
that
that
master
had
registered
the
same
idiomatic
width
for
the
two
canals
from
first
to
last
throughout
his
long
series
of
records
the
observation
thus
made
proved
to
apply
to
each
and
all
of
these
curious
twins
diversity
in
width
for
different
doubles
appears
plainly
in
drawings
where
more
than
one
double
is
depicted
as
an
example
two
drawings
are
here
given
in
the
text
made
the
one
on
july
and
the
other
on
july
in
them
the
phison
euphrates
djihoun
and
thoth
appear
contrasted
as
unmistakably
as
either
of
them
does
with
the
single
canals
apparent
at
the
same
time
that
this
drawing
is
typical
is
borne
out
by
all
the
best
measures
of
the
several
doubles
as
seen
at
successive
oppositions
and
marshaled
in
the
subjoined
list
how
truly
individual
the
quality
is
stands
proved
by
the
relative
values
in
different
years
which
are
even
more
accordant

the

poor
here
we
have
widths
ranging
from
eleven
degrees
to
two
the
widths
given
are
those
when
the
canal
was
at
or
sufficiently
near
its
full
strength
and
are
measured
from
the
centres
of
the
constituents
we
notice
two
points
the
agreement
of
the
same
canal
with
itself
and
its
systematic
disagreement
with
others
but
what
is
especially
to
the
point
if
we
compare
the
values
found
at
successive
oppositions
we
find
that
for
different
canals
the
values
agree
in
their
difference
this
shows
that
each
of
these
values
is
in
most
cases
if
not
in
all
a
norm
for
that
particular
canal
a
value
distinctive
of
it
and
to
which
it
either
absolutely
or
relatively
conforms
in
other
words
the
width
of
the
gemination
is
a
personal
peculiarity
of
the
particular
canal
as
much
an
idiosyncrasy
of
it
as
its
position
on
the
planet
two
general
classes
may
be
distinguished
those
up
to
about
five
degrees
in
width
apart
and
those
above
this
figure
whether
such
very
widely
separated
lines
as
go
to
make
up
the
second
class
such
as
the
nilokeras
i
and
ii
constitutes
a
double
is
a
debatable
point
schiaparelli
thought
they
did
and
so
classed
them
to
me
it
did
not
at
first
occur
so
to
consider
them
and
in
some
instances
such
as
the
helicon
i
and
ii
later
observations
seem
to
justify
the
omission
with
the
nilokeras
i
and
ii
the
outcome
seems
the
other
way
the
reasons
for
distrust
of
a
physical
relation
between
the
constituents
is
not
so
much
the
distance
separating
them
nor
any
lack
of
parallelism
as
the
manner
in
which
they
show
alone
even
this
however
tends
to
be
recognized
in
the
narrower
pairs
as
they
come
to
be
better
seen
it
may
be
that
width
alone
is
wholly
competent
to
selective
showing
for
the
farther
apart
two
lines
are
on
the
planet
the
more
opportunity
is
afforded
the
air
waves
to
disclose
the
one
without
the
other
a
relative
revelation
which
is
constantly
happening
to
detail
in
different
parts
of
the
disk
as
long
as
any
doubt
exists
of
a
physical
community
of
interest
it
seems
best
to
distinguish
such
possibly
merely
parallel
canals
by
suffixed
numerals
of
this
class
of
doubles
is
the
nilokeras
i
and
ii
so
wide
is
it
that
lampland
succeeded
in
photographing
it
as
such
the
two
constituents
showing
well
separated
and
if
it
prove
a
true
double
it
will
be
the
first
martian
double
to
leave
its
impress
on
a
sensitive
plate
although
separated
by
four
hundred
miles
of
territory
the
two
lines
are
parallel
so
far
as
observation
can
detect
which
of
course
is
not
so
very
easy
with
the
lines
so
far
apart
in
the
country
between
one
crosswise
canal
certainly
lies
the
phryxus
and
much
shading
thus
far
unaccounted
for
recent
discoveries
however
point
to
the
cause
of
such
shading
as
lines
imperfectly
seen
for
in
some
cases
the
lines
have
actually
disclosed
themselves
and
warrant
us
in
believing
that
it
is
only
imperfect
seeing
that
keeps
the
others
hid
of
the
pair
the
nilokeras
i
is
itself
double
curiously
reproducing
what
sometimes
is
seen
in
the
case
of
double
stars
one
of
whose
components
turns
out
to
be
itself
a
binary
the
second
line
of
the
nilokeras
i
lies
close
to
its
primary
on
the
north
and
was
on
the
only
occasion
of
its
detection
the
merest
of
gossamers
while
the
nilokeras
i
itself
stood
out
strong
and
dark
thus
do
these
martian
details
increase
and
multiply
in
intricacy
the
better
the
seeing
brings
them
out
in
the
case
of
the
other
doubles
the
doubles
proper
so
to
speak
there
is
every
indication
of
a
physical
bond
between
the
pair
what
that
bond
may
be
is
another
matter
and
seems
to
be
of
different
divulging
according
to
the
particular
instance
at
one
end
of
the
subject
both
as
the
widest
of
these
doubles
and
one
of
the
most
important
stands
the
ganges
the
components
of
the
canal
are
apart
this
great
width
joined
to
the
fact
of
scant
extension
gives
the
canal
a
stocky
aspect
its
breadth
being
but
one
sixth
of
its
length
its
width
draws
attention
to
it
while
the
phenomena
it
exhibits
intrigue
curiosity
as
early
as
the
first
opposition
of
my
observations
in
the
canal
as
it
underwent
the
process
of
doubling
showed
phases
of
peculiarity
it
was
first
caught
by
me
as
a
double
over
toward
the
terminator
or
fading
edge
of
the
disk
then
as
it
was
brought
nearer
the
centre
by
the
gaining
upon
the
longitudes
showed
as
a
broad
swath
of
shading
of
a
width
apparently
equal
to
any
it
later
exhibited
in
this
appearance
it
continued
for
some
months
and
then
in
october
began
to
show
a
clarification
toward
the
centre
once
started
the
lightening
of
its
midway
advanced
till
at
last
on
november
it
stood
out
an
unmistakable
double
the
two
lines
standing
where
the
edges
of
the
swath
had
previously
been
had
the
observations
here
been
all
that
one
could
wish
the
method
of
gemination
would
have
been
certain
and
of
great
interest
unfortunately
the
observations
left
much
to
be
desired
and
those
repeated
in
and
were
of
like
doubtfulness
a
period
of
swarthy
confusion
preceded
the
plainly
dual
state
but
whether
the
double
simply
clarified
or
widened
as
well
it
was
not
possible
to
assure
one
s
self
that
the
canal
exhibited
plainly
the
effects
of
seasonal
development
was
as
unmistakable
as
the
steps
themselves
were
open
to
ambiguity
in
the
canal
was
at
its
minimum
and
hardly
to
be
made
out
it
seemed
then
to
show
an
actual
change
in
width
coincident
with
alteration
of
visibility
but
this
too
could
not
be
predicated
with
certainty
it
was
also
surmisable
that
the
westernmost
line
was
the
one
from
which
the
development
proceeded
in
much
more
was
made
out
about
it
training
in
the
subject
and
increased
proximity
of
the
planet
contributing
to
the
result
it
now
became
clear
to
me
that
the
canal
did
develop
from
the
western
side
for
the
western
edge
made
a
dark
line
of
definite
boundary
from
which
shading
proceeded
to
the
eastern
side
where
it
faded
almost
imperceptibly
off
with
no
defined
line
to
mark
its
limit
that
this
shading
gradually
darkened
was
evident
but
that
when
it
could
be
seen
at
all
it
extended
to
the
extreme
limit
of
the
eventual
double
restricted
the
character
if
not
the
fact
of
an
actual
widening
at
this
opposition
too
the
canal
passed
through
its
period
of
minimum
visibility
and
was
then
seen
whenever
it
could
be
caught
as
a
confused
swath
of
full
width
in
the
case
of
this
canal
then
a
widening
in
the
sense
of
a
bodily
separation
of
two
lines
seems
inadmissible
on
the
other
hand
the
gradual
darkening
of
the
swath
and
especially
the
advance
of
the
darkening
from
the
western
side
points
to
an
interesting
process
there

place

so
far
been
able
to
make

fifths

slender

very
nearly
at

them

in

of

conform
apparently
to
the
type
of
the
djihoun
rather
than
to
that
of
the

consideration
of
them
fails
to
find
any
increase
or

of
distance
between
the
pairs
of
the

times
which
can
not
be
referred
to

observation
of
such
minute
detail
in
short
the
double
is
made
by
the
addition
of
a
second
line
in
a
particular
position
and
not
by
a
growth
out
to
it
of
a
line
coincident
to
begin
with
with
the
first
i
have
said
that
the
average
width
between
the
two
lines
of
the
doubles
was
about
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
this
average
width
denotes
anything
more
than
an
average
or
in
other
words
that
it
denotes
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
norm
the
remark
is
important
in
view
of
a
suggestion
which
i
have
heard
made
that
we
have
here
a
system
based
on
fundamental
martian
units
in
which
or
in
multiples
of
which
the
dimensions
of
the
canals
are
implicitly
expressed
such
however
does
not
seem
to
be
the
case
in
some
instances
indeed
we
have
certain
evidence
to
the
contrary
and
that
the
width
of
the
double
is
conditioned
solely
by
antecedent
place
the
phison
and
euphrates
offer
a
case
in
point
these
two
important
arteries
in
duplicate
leave
as
we
saw
from
two
carets
in
the
mare

the
portus
sigaei
held
in
common
tenancy
by
both
each
pair
then
proceeds
down
the
disk
inclined
at
its
own
particular
angle
to
the
meridian
in
order
to
reach
by
a
great
circle
course
a
certain
spot
the
pseboas
lucus
in
one
case
the
luci
ismenii
in
the
other
as
one
of
these
angles
is
degrees
while
the
other
is
only
three
they
must
from
the
circumstances
of
their
setting
out
have
not
only
different
widths
but
widths
determinately
different
in
advance
since
each
is
roughly
speaking
foreshortened
by
the
degree
of
divergence
from
the
meridian
the
one
therefore
must
be
about
four
degrees
to
the
other
s
something
less
than
three
and
a
half
this
is
what
they
actually
are
as
determined
by
measurement
from
observation
that
the
calculated
value
agrees
with
that
found
from
observation
helps
certify
to
a
community
of
but
it
completely
does
away
with
comprehensive
design
in
the
question
of
their
widths
for
if
the
one
were
so
settled
the
other
could
not
be
indeed
the
next
example
seems
to
deny
it
to
both
this
example
occurs
too
not
far
away
from
the
scene
of
the
first
in
the
twin
bays
of
the
sabaeus
sinus
from
which
depart
the
double
hiddekel
and
the
two
gihon
these
twin
gulfs
bear
so
little
imprint
of
being
other
than
natural
formations
that
they
have
been
universally
and
very
likely
quite
rightly
taken
for
such
ever
since
dawes
discovered
them
in
long
before
things
like
canals
were
dreamed
of
it
is
strange
that
when
the
hiddekel
and
the
gihon
were
found
by
me
to
be
double
in
with
a
branch
of
both
leading
from
each
bay
the
connection
between
the
sceptically
scouted
doubles
and
the
thoroughly
bays
should
have
been
apparent
for
to
link
a
ghost
to
materiality
if
it
does
not
discredit
the
materiality
serves
to
substantialize
the
ghost
furthermore
it
shows
that
in
this
case
neither
the
one
double
nor
the
other
can
have
had
its
width
engineered
on
any
preconceived
scale
unless
the
twin
bays
be
themselves
so
accounted
for
so
that
it
seems
useless
to
seek
for
cryptic
standards
in
the
canals
or
to
think
to
find
them
a
measure
of
value
from
the
fact
of
their
being
a
medium
of
exchange

opposition
after
having
long
been
suspected
without

being

make
sure
of
it
these
instances
taken
in
connection
with
the
wide
range
of
values
in
the
widths
presented
by
different
canals
serve
to
show
that
the
distance
between
the
twin
lines
is
an
individual
characteristic
of
the
particular
canal
and

to
point
to
its
cause

some
cases

these

out
to
have
something
to
say
for

on
the

of
their

and

with

to
position
probably
the
first
query
to
suggest
itself
to
an
investigator
to
ask
is
of
the
direction
in
which
they
run
is
there
a
preponderance
manifest
in
them
for
one
direction
over
another
do
they
show
an
inclination
to
the
vertical
to
the
horizontal
or
to
some
tilt

to
answer
this
we
may
box
the

and
taking
the

points
with
the
twelve
next
most
important
points
between
for
sectional
division
segregate
the

according
to
their
individual
trend
as
we
have
no
means
of
determining
in
which
sense
any
direction
is
to
be
taken
indeed
it
is
not
to
be
taken
alternately
in

get
eight

account

exhibited

it
would
correspond
with

whether
this
be
so
we
will
take
only
those
double
canals
that
lie

in

respectively
and
note
those
in

run

in

in

in

is
common
to

we
find

the
ratio
of
the
southwesterly

the
southeasterly
to
but
the
proportion
of
the
course
of
these
canals
in
the
two
hemispheres
is
on
the
side
of
this
same
ratio
from
their
direction
we
now
pass
to
consideration
of
their
distribution
in
longitude
it
appears
that
some
meridians
are
more
favored
than
others
the
hemisphere
which
has
the
syrtis
major
for
centre
is
more
prolific
in
them
than
its
antipodes
from
longitude
to
there
are
ten
doubles
from
to
and
from
to
seventeen
or
roughly
in
the
proportion
of
and
that
this
distribution
means
anything
by
itself
is
doubtful
it
is
much
more
likely
to
be
a
general
topographical
consequence
of
their
distribution
in
another
direction
which
proves
to
be
highly
significant

from
this

the

forty
degrees
of
the

a

not
in

to

of

which
though
diminishing
toward
the

do
so
at
no
such
rate
the

of

is
of

whereas
the

of
the

of

found

is
the
doubles
are
then
an
equatorial
feature
of
the
planet
confined
to
the
tropic
and
temperate
belts
to
perceive
the
tropical
character
of
the
doubles
in
another
way
we
have
but
to
consider
the
zonal
distribution
of
the
single
canals
unlike
the
former
the
latter
do
not
thin
out
as
one
advances
toward
the
poles
since
in
the
arctic
regions
single
canals
bemesh
the
surface
as
meticulously
as
elsewhere
it
is
only
that
they
there
replace
the
doubles
or
not
to
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
it
is
the
doubles
that
in
part
replace
the
singles
in
the
tropics
and
that
this
arrangement
has
something
physical
behind
it
by
way
of
cause
is
curiously
shown
by
two
canals
the
arnon
and
the
kison
which
are
neither
of
the
one
kind
nor
yet
the
other
but
a
cross
between
the
two
for
the
arnon
and
the
kison
are
convergent
doubles
the
two
lines
of
the
kison
leaving
a
common
point
at
the
edge
of
the
polar
cap
and
separating
as
they
travel
south
while
the
two
arnon
take
up
and
continue
the
divergence
connecting
at
last
with
the
parallel
pair
of
the
euphrates
these
canals
thus
make
transition
between
the
true
doubles
and
the
true
singles
and
may
be
looked
upon
as
endowed
with
the
potentialities
of
both
from
their
association
with
the
double
euphrates
it
is
clear
that
the
transition
between
the
two
forms
is
not
only
formal
but
physical
and
that
the
stopping
of
the
dual
condition
at
the
fortieth
parallel
is
not
the
outcome
of
chance
it
may
occur
to
the
thoughtful
that
the
doubles
appear
confined
to
the
more
tropical
portions
of
the
planet
because
of
a
better
presentation
of
those
zones
the
reader
supposing
the
planet
to
be
seen
axised
perpendicularly
to
the
plane
of
sight
as
geographies
represent
the
earth
s
globe
the
supposition
however
is
erroneous
we
sometimes
see
the
planet
so
but
more
often
not
such
is
the
tilt
of
the
martian
axis
to
the
plane
of
the
martian
ecliptic
that
the
different
zones
are
rarely
seen
on
an
even
keel
so
to
speak
their
aspects
shifting
totally
from
one
opposition
to
another
what
shows
in
on
one
occasion
may
be
degrees
removed
from
it
at
another
a
distance
amounting
to
of
the
way
from
apparent
equator
to
apparent
pole
thus
the
double
canals
are
for
some
intrinsic
reason
equatorial
features
of
the
planet
as
opposed
to
polar
ones
and
this
not
simply
because
of
greater
space
there
duality
is
a
result
of
conditions
intrinsic
to
the
several
localities
what
the
cause
may
be
is
related
to
the
character
of
the
things
themselves
which
we
shall
later
consider
for
the
moment
we
may
note
that
the
fact
disposes
quietly
of
the
diplopic
theory
of
their
manufacture
for
for
diplopic
doubles
to
show
such
respect
for
the
equator
would
betoken
a
courtesy
in
them
to
be
commended
of
sydney
smith
but
this
is
not
their
only
geographic
bias
in
addition
to
not
being
partial
to
the
poles
the
double
canals
show
a
certain
exclusiveness
toward
the
dark
areas
generally
not
only
do
they
avoid
the
arctic
and
antarctic
zones
entirely
but
they
largely
shun
the
regions
in
these
but
two
suspicions
of
doubles
occur
in
the
aonium
sinus
although
single
canals
there
are
as
numerous
as
anywhere
else
on
the
planet
nevertheless
although
they
avoid
running
through
them
they
run
from
them
in
a
manner
that
is
marked
proceeding
from
the
great
diaphragm
are
no
less
than
out
of
the
doubles
connecting
directly
with
these
are
more
while
the
remaining
are
also
associated
through
the
intermediarism
of

canals
in
the
dark
regions
seventeen
years
after
the
recognition
of
the
canals
in
the
light
regions
occurred
another
important
event
the
discovery
of
a
similar
set
in
the
dark
ones
the
detection
of
these
markings
in
the
dark
areas
was
a
more
difficult
feat
than
the
perceiving
of
those
in
the
light
and
in
consequence
was
later
accomplished
also
was
it
one
where
recognition
came
by
degrees
i
have
previously
pointed
out
what
this
discovery
did
for
the
less
than
the
taking
away
of
their
character
in
a
generally
convincing
manner
to
one
who
had
carefully
considered
the
matter
the
seas
had
indeed
already
lost
it
as
was
shown
in
chapter
x
but
to
those
who
had
not
these
canals
presented
a
very
instant
proof
of
the
fact
from
such
not
wholly
supererogatory
service
they
went
on
to
furnish
help
in
other
directions
their
discovery
showed
in
the
first
place
that
no
part
of
the
planet
s
surface
was
free
from
canal
triangulation
but
it
did
more
than
this
for
these
canals
in
the
dark
regions
left
the
edge
of
the
continents
at
the
very
points
where
the
canals
of
the
light
regions
entered
them
which
fact
proved
for
them
a
community
of
interest
with
the
latter
such
continuation
was
highly
significant
since
it
linked
the
two
together
into
a
single
system
compassing
the
whole
surface
of
the
planet
starting
from
the
places
where
the
canals
come
out
upon
the
great
girdle
of
seas
that
stretches
all
round
the
planet
most
of
the
new
canals
headed
toward
the
passes
between
the
islands
south
as
nearly
polewards
as
circumstances
of
local
topography
would
permit
in
the
broader
expanses
of
the
syrtis
major
and
the
mare
erythraeum
besides
main
arteries
others
went
to
spots
in
their
midst
after
the
same
fashion
as
those
of
the
light
regions
these
spots
differed
in
no
way
apparently
from
their
fellow
oases
elsewhere
from
a
spot
in
the
centre
of
the
syrtis
three
great
lines
thus
traveled
south
the
dosaron
heading
straight
up
the
syrtis
on
the
meridian
till
it
struck
the
northernmost
point
of
hellas
the
orosines
inclined
more
to
the
right
passing
through
the
dark
channel
to
the
west
of
that
land
and
so
proceeding
south
and
lastly
the
erymanthus
turning
eastward
till
it
brought
up
finally
at
the
hesperidum
lucus
where
on
the
other
hand
the
long
chain
of
lighter
land
called
by
schiaparelli
islands
and
stretching
from
the
solis
lacus
region
westward
to
hellas
offered
only
here
and
there
an
exit
the
canals
made
for
these
exits
the
canals
in
the
mare
sirenum
the
mare
cimmerium
and
the
mare
tyrrhenum
struck
more
or
less
diagonally
across
those
seas
from
their
northern
termini
to
the
entrances
of
the
straits
between
the
islands
thus
lacing
the
seas
in
the
way
a
sail
is
rolled
to
its
spar
from
the
exact
manner
in
which
they
connected
with
the
canals
they
proved
the
two
to
be
part
and
parcel
of
one
system
which
in
its
extension
was
and
therefore
proportionately
important
whatever
of
strange
interest
the
curious
characteristics
of
the
canals
themselves
suggested
was
now
greatly
increased
by
this
addition
for
the
solidarity
of
the
phenomenon
affected
the
cogency
of
any
argument
derived
from
it
in
only
the
dark
areas
of
the
southern
hemisphere
were
found
to
be
thus
laced
with
lines
for
then
so
great
was
the
tilt
of
the
planet
s
south
pole
toward
the
earth
that
while
those
zones
were
well
displayed
the
dark
patches
of
the
northern
hemisphere
were
more
or
less
over
the
disk
s
northern
horizon
contrast
was
the
open
sesame
to
their
detection
when
the
show
dark
the
lines
are
lost
in
the
sombreness
of
the
background
as
the
maria
lighten
the
lines
come
out
such
was
amply
witnessed
by
the
effect
in
and
in
i
found
it
impossible
to
perceive
them
except
where
the
padargus
crossed
atlantis
for
the
hue
of
the
themselves
was
then
very
dark
in
on
the
other
hand
i
saw
them
without
difficulty
what
is
also
of
interest
so
soon
as
seen
they
appeared
small
without
haziness
or
distention
as
the
oppositions
succeeded
one
another
the
northern
regions
rose
into
view
and
with
their
appearance
came
the
detection
in
them
of
the
same
phenomena
no
large
dark
areas
like
the
diaphragm
exist
there
but
the
smaller
patches
of
which
bestrew
them
proved
to
be
similarly
meshed
at
first
canals
were
evident
upon
their
peripheries
contouring
them
about
then
the
bodies
themselves
of
the
patches
showed
by
lines
the
mare
acidalium
with
its
adjuncts
the
lucus
niliacus
on
the
south
and
the
lacus
hyperboreus
on
the
north
thus
stood
out
in
on
a
particularly
good
evening
of
definition
at
the
end
of
may
the
mare
suddenly
made
background
for
a
sunburst
of
dark
rays
six
of
them
in
all
radiating
from
a
point
between
it
and
the
lacus
hyperboreus
considering
how
sombre
the
mare
was
at
the
time
this
was
as
remarkable
a
vision
as
it
was
striking
to
see
although
at
the
moment
the
sight
was
of
the
nature
of
a
revelation
these
lines
have
been
amply
verified
since
as
the
martian
season
has
proved
more
propitious
similar
decipherment
has
befallen
all
the
other
patches
of
in
the
northern
hemisphere
these
having
shown
themselves
first
circumscribed
and
then
traversed

interesting
instances
were
the
wedge
of
casius
and
the
propontis
these
markings
first
perceived
years
ago
as
mere
patches
of
shading
then
partially
resolved
by
schiaparelli
now
stood
revealed
as
a
perfect
network
of
lines
and
spots
so
many
of
both
kinds
of
their
detail
occupied
the
ground
that
to
identify
them
all
was
matter
of
exceeding
difficulty
the
outcome
is
shown
in
the
diagrammatic
representations
opposite

on

these
drawings
disclose
better
than
any
description
the
mass
of
detail
of
which
the
patches
are
in
reality
composed
and
serve
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
complexity
involved
if
the
general
canal
system
seems
intricate
here
is
something
which
exceeds
that
as
much
again
illustration
the
propontis
the
extension
in
this
manner
of
the
curious
triangulation
of
the
light
areas
into
and
through
all
the
dark
areas
as
well
by
thus
spreading
the
field
of
its
operations
over
both
terranes
complexioned
so
unlike
greatly
increases
the
cogency
of
the
deduction
that
this
detail
is
of
later
origin
than
the
background
upon
which
it
rests
that
the
mesh
of
lines
covers
not
only
the
ochre
stretches
of
the
disk
but
the
parts
as
well
makes
it
still
more
certain
that
it
is
not
a
simple
physical
outcome
of
the
fundamental
forces
that
featured
the
planet
s
face
for
in
that
case
it
could
not
with
such
absolute
impartiality
involve
both
alike
thus
here
again
we
find
corroboration
by
later
observations
of
what
earlier
ones
established
a
last
link
in
the
chain
of
canal
sequences
remains
to
be
recorded
just
as
the
lines
in
the
dark
regions
continued
those
in
the
light
so
they
themselves
turned
out
to
be
similarly
prolonged
and
in
no
less
suggestive
a
manner
for
when
the
north
polar
zone
came
to
be
displayed
canals
were
evident
there
continuing
those
in
the
other
zones
and
running
at
their
northern
ends
into
dark
spots
at
the
edge
of
the
polar
cap
here
then
we
have
the
end
of
the
whole
system
or
more
properly
its
origin
in
the
polar
snows
the
significance
of
this
will
be
seen
from
other
phenomena
to
a
consideration
of
which
we
now
proceed
chapter

oases
next
to
be
caught
of
the
details
of
this
most
curious
network
that
meshes
the
surface
of
mars
was
a
set
of
phenomena
stranger
even
than
the
lines
to
wit
dark
round
dots
standing
at
their
intersections
more
difficult
to
make
out
than
the
lines
they
were
in
consequence
detected
thus
later
by
fifteen
years
once
discovered
however
it
became
possible
to
trace
their
unconscious
recognition
back
in
time
thus
schiaparelli
told
the
writer
in
apropos
of
those
found
at
flagstaff
that
he
had
himself
suspected
them
but
could
not
make
sure
some
of
them
stand
figured
in
his
dealing
with
the
opposition
of
but
not
published
till
in
such
posthumous
recognition
as
one
may
call
it
the
spots
repeated
the
history
of
the
canals
for
schiaparelli
had
himself
pointed
out
a
similar
preconscious
visioning
of
the
canals
in
the
delicate
pencilings
of
dawes
and
the
streaks
of
lockyer
kaiser
and
secchi
now
translatable
as
representing
the
phison
the
euphrates
and
half
a
dozen
other
canals
imperfectly
seen
that
both
the
canals
and
the
oases
were
thus
sketched
before
they
were
seen
well
enough
to
be
definitely
discovered
is
to
an
unprejudiced
mind
among
their
strongest
credentials
to
credit
nor
was
schiaparelli
the
sole
person
thus
to
get
proof
before
letter
one
of
their
very
earliest
portrayals
appears
in
a
drawing
by
otto
boeddicker
made
on
december
where
the
pseboas
lucus
is
clearly
represented
in
a
still
more
imperfect
manner
some
of
the
spots
had
been
adumbrated
and
their
shadows
drawn
long
before
that
thus
they
may
be
deciphered
as
the
cause
of
patches
drawn
by
dawes
in
though
none
of
them
were
in
any
definite
sense
detected
till
and
only
then
so
ill
defined
that
their
true
character
was
not
apparent
as
patches
they
are
still
commonly
seen
at
observatories
where
the
observational
conditions
are
not
of
the
best
and
the
study
of
the
planet
not
systematically
enough
pursued
to
have
them
disclose
their
true
shape
and
size
the
history
of
their
detection
is
resumed
in
the
experience
of
the
individual
observer
during
the
course
of
my
own
observations
i
have
had
occasion
to
notice
the
several
stages
in
recognition
of
the
spots
which
have
marked
their
chronologic
career
as
with
the
lines
three
stages
in
the
appearance
of
the
spots
may
be
remarked
first
where
the
scattering
of
the
rays
is
so
wide
that
dilution
prevents
anything
from
being
seen
second
where
the
commotion
being
less
the
object
appears
as
a
gray
patch
and
third
where
in
comparative
quiet
it
condenses
into
a
black
dot
for
the
two
former
our
own
air
waves
are
to
blame
in
coursing
waves
of
condensation
and
rarefaction
they
spread
the
image
of
the
spot
as
they
do
that
of
the
canal
then
as
the
currents
calm
the
spot
shrinks
to
its
normal
proportions
and
in
so
doing
darkens
in
consequence
of
being
less
widely
diffused
thus
the
evolution
in
perception
which
may
take
place
in
the
course
of
an
hour
for
a
particular
observer
represents
exactly
what
has
occurred
in
the
person
of
the
race
by
the
improvement
in
observational
methods
and
sites
that
the
spots
although
wider
than
the
canals
remained
longer
hidden
from
human
sight
is
due
to
the
fact
that
a
tenuous
line
may
be
perceived
to
its
when
a
dot
of
the
same
diameter
would
be
invisible
summation
of
impressions
is
undoubtedly
the
cause
of
this
the
mere
fact
that
a
row
of
retinal
cones
is
struck
although
each
be
but
feebly
affected
is
sufficient
to
raise
the
sum
total
into
the
sphere
of
consciousness
in
the
second
stage
of
their
visibility
the
spots
are
in
danger
of
mistake
with
the
smaller
true
patches
of
sombre
hue
which
fleck
the
northern
hemisphere
of
the
planet
and
from
which
they
differ
totally
in
kind
totally
so
far
as
our
present
perception
goes
such
true
patches
consist
of
a
groundwork
of
shading
upon
which
indeed
are
superposed
the
usual
network
of
lines
and
spots
prominent
as
instances
of
them
are
the
trivium
charontis
the
wedge
of
casius
and
the
mare
acidalium
with
patches
of
the
sort
the
spots
proper
must
not
be
confounded
close
treading
on
the
heels
of
the
detection
of
lines
athwart
the
seas
came
the
recognition
of
spots
there
likewise
at
the
opposition
of
the
number
was
added
to
and
so
the
tale
has
been
steadily
increased
their
number
as
found
at
flagstaff
up
to
the
present
time
that
is
to
the
close
of
the
opposition
of
is
of
which
lie
in
the
light
regions
in
the
dark
areas
of
the
southern
hemisphere
and
in
the
smaller
sombre
patches
of
the
northern
zones
from
their
relationships
and
behavior
it
became
apparent
that
the
spots
were
not
lakes
but
something
which
answered
much
more
nearly
to
oases
of
the
spots
three
kinds
may
be
distinguished
the
large
the
little
and
the
less
if
by
the
latter
term
it
may
be
permitted
to
denote
what
has
but
collateral
claim
to
be
included
and
yet
demands
a
certain
recognition
for
though
not
spots
like
the
others
the
members
of
the
third
class
have
certain
traits
in
common
with
them
while
differing
radically
in
others
to
the
kind
called
large
belong
the
greater
number
of
spots
so
far
found
upon
the
disk
they
are
large
only
by
comparison
with
the
little

they
measure

to
my
latest
determinations

one

in
diameter

is
their
tone
that
chiefly
catches
the
eye

they
are
commonly
the
darkest
markings
on
the

against
the
ochre
stretches
they
appear
black
and
even
in
the
midst
of
the
dark
areas
they
stand
out
almost
as
much
contrasted
with
their
surroundings
as
these
do
with
the
light
regions
themselves

a
hundred
and
forty

now
known
those
in
the
light
areas
were
discovered
first
those
in
the
dark
regions
being
harder
to
see
of
this
first
kind
are
such
spots
as
the
pseboas
lucus
the
aquae
calidae
the

the

the
nine
ways

mention
no
more

no
dissimilarity
in

the
phenomena
are
all
remarkably
alike
and
clearly
betoken
one
and
the
same
class
of
objects
differing
between
themselves
at
most
in
size
and
importance
in
form
they
all
seem
to
be
round
they
certainly
appear
so

it
not
that
retinal
images
of
small
areas
tend
to
assume
this
shape
might
implicitly
be
credited
with
being
what
they
seem
the
reason
for
optical
circularity
probably
resides
in
the
shape
of
the
retinal
cones
and
in
their
patterning
into
a
mosaic
floor
so
that
unless
a
sufficient
number
of
cones
be
struck
the
image
takes
on
to
consciousness
a
roughly
circular
it
be
so
in
fact
or
not
in
the
present
case
however
they
seem
to
be
too
well
seen

of
the
sort
the

distinguished
from
the

not
very
distant
from
the
equator
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
matter
of
accident
it
is
not
one
of
perception
since
this
part
of
the
planet
was
not
the
best
place
for
observation
at
the
time
they
were
discovered
to
make
out
one
of
these
little
dots
is
a
peculiarly
pleasing
bit
of
observation
as
it
requires
particularly
good
definition
one
might
almost
take
them
for
upon
the
image
did
they
not
move
with
the
disk
they
have
no
perceptible
size
and
yet
are
clearly
larger
in
diameter
than
the
canals
which
run
into
them
which
proves
how
very
slender
the
latter
must
be
very
early
in
the
detection
of
the
spots
it
became
evident
that
they
were
not
scattered
haphazard
over
the
surface
but
that
on
the
contrary
they
were
never
found
except
at
the
of
the
lines
from
this
it
must
not
be
supposed
as
has
been
done
that
the
spots
are
merely
optical
reinforcements
of
the
lines
at
their
crossings
due
to
the
more
crowded
character
there
of
the
lines
themselves
that
they
are
not
such
is
demonstrated
by
the
existence
of
crossings
where
either
temporarily
or
permanently
none
appear
which
shows
that
they
are
far
too
well
seen
for
any
such
illusion
about
them
to
be
possible
at
these
crossings
the
lines
traverse
one
another
without
thickening
whether
they
be
single
or
double
lines
the
spots
on
the
other
hand
are
much
wider
than
the
lines
giving
a
beaded
look
to
the
threads
in
short
they
are
the
knots
to
the
canal

all
the
more
important
junctions
are
characterized
by
their
presence
such
starred
junctions
are
not
confined
to
the
ochre
regions
they
dot
the
light
and
the
dark
areas
with
equal
impartiality
thus
showing
themselves
to
be
independent
of
the
nature
of
the
ground
where
large
stretches
of
country
are
concerned
on
the
other
hand
they
appear
to
be
unusually
numerous
in
the
smaller
isolated
dark
areas
of
the
northern
hemisphere
such
as
the
trivium
the
mare
acidalium
the
propontis
and
the
wedge
of
casius
here
they
crowd
and
one
can
not
avoid
the
inference
that
their
plentifulness
in
these
regions
is
not
due
to
chance

a

ratio

are
thus
connected

simply
in

in

the
one
is
clearly
dependent

the
other

of
the

gauged
by
the
magnitude
of
its
communications
from
the
fact
of

we
now
pass
to
the
manner
of
it
which
is
quite
as
remarkable
the
position
of
the
spot
relative
to
its
tributary
canals
depends
upon
the
character
of
the
connecting
lines
if
the
canal
be
single
it
runs
so
far
as
may
be
judged
straight
into
the
middle
of
the
oasis
or
in
other
words
the
oasis
is
symmetrically
disposed
about
its
end
this
is
true
of
the
greater
number
of
the
large
spots
and
of
all
the
little
ones
since
the
latter
have
as
connections
only
single
canals
in
the
case
of
a
double
canal
arriving
at
a
spot
a
different
and
most
curious
dependence
is
observable
this
fact
i
first
noticed
in
a
general
way
at
the
opposition
of
the
initial
appearance
of
it
being
presented
on
september
by
the
coloe
palus
and
the
phison
it
was
again
visible
in
the
case
of
the
spots
in
the
trivium
at
the
time
the
canals
leading
to
that
place
doubled
in
march
but
the
exact
nature
of
the
phenomenon
was
not
fully
appreciated
till
when
the
thing
was
seen
so
well
as
to
appear
cut
on
copper
plate
it
was
this
the
spot
is
exactly
embraced
between
the
two
arms
of
the
double
canal
it
is
moreover
seemingly
perfectly
round
and
just
fits
in
between
the
parallel
lines
the
ascraeus
lucus
was
the
first
spot
that
showed
thus
in
association
with
the
double
gigas
others
followed
suit
in
so
showing
several
specimens
presenting
themselves
so
well
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
the
precise
connection
the
sight
presented
by
such
a
spot
and
its
incasing
double
is
a
beautiful
bit
of
detail
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
so
far
to
be
seen
upon
the
martian
disk
the
distinctness
with
which
it
stands
out
on
occasion
suggests
a
steel
engraving
and
shows
how
the
martian
features
really
are
when
our
own
air
ceases
from
troubling
and
allows
them
to
be
at
rest
incidentally
we
may
note
that
this
phenomenon
alone
serves
to
disprove
the
diplopic
theory
of
the
production
of
the
double
canals
for
if
a
double
were
a
single
line
seen
out
of
focus
any
spot
upon

should
be
doubled

lucus
and
it
may
seem
to
the
reader
as
if
what
was
seen
in
was
but
an
unimportant
advance
over
the
observed
phenomena
of
not
so
however
for
with
the
earlier
instances
it
was
not
possible
to
be
sure
of
the
precise
limits
of
the
spot
with
regard
to
the
double
the
coloe
palus
on
the
one
hand
did
not
fill
all
the
space
apparently
between
the
double
phison
while
the
lucus
ismenius
more
than
did
so
with
the
double
euphrates
to
have
set
down
the
different
appearances
to
insufficient
definition
would
have
been
a
great
mistake
as
subsequent
observation
has
served
to
show
the
lucus
ismenius
instances
this
in
it
was
seen
terminating
the
euphrates
blocking
all
the
space
between
the
two
lines
and
extending
a
little
upon
either
side
of
them
now
from
its
appearance
in
it
was
evident
that
the
effect
had
been
produced
by
twin
spots
lying
along
the
deuteronilus
the
axis
joining
them
being
perpendicular
to
the
euphrates
in
the
relation
was
still
better
explained
by
what
appeared
then
when
not
only
did
the
two
spots
stand
out
but
the
euphrates
showed
with
a
line
running
centrally
into
each
although
originally
seen
by
schiaparelli
as
a
single
spot
and
so
at
first
seen
by
me
better
acquaintance
with
the
disk
disclosed
to
both
observers
its
really
dual
character
as
this
pair
has
persisted

the

of

is
that
it

just
off

that
it

is
exceeding
curious
considering
that
it
is
the
sole
example
of
such
position
strictly
speaking
it
is
not
the
protonilus

the
point
where
the
protonilus
turns
into
the
nilosyrtis
to
which
it
stands
thus
neighboringly
aloof

this
may
explain
the
anomaly

the

not
the

of

to
have
been
a
more
or
less
fundamental
feature
of
the

the
rest
the

has
the
form
and
possesses
the
canal
connections
appropriate
to
its
state
it
is
apparently

and
lies
between

of

also
between

not

with

at

the

however
has
no

carets
on
the
borders
of
the
great
diaphragm
functionally
related
to
the
canal
system
and
yet
in
look
and
location
contrasted
with
its
other
details
is
a
further
set
of
markings
detected
by
me
in
and
reseen
at
subsequent
oppositions
since
along
the
north
border
of
the
southern
seas
they
lie
upon
what
used
to
be
thought
the
continental
coastline
the
fringing
edge
of
that
almost
continuous
band
of
shading
that
belts
the
martian
globe
throughout
the
southern
subtropic
zone
and
called
by
schiaparelli
the
great
diaphragm
the
terrane
lends
itself
to
the
appellative
forming
as
it
does
a
dark
dividing
strip
of
country
between
the
brilliant
hemisphere
on
the
north
and
the
islands
to
the
south
of
it
by
schiaparelli
it
was
thought
to
be
one
long
mediterranean
and
though
its
marine
character
is
now
disproved
that
it
lies
lower
than
the
bright
ochre
regions
is
likely
to
this
difference
of
level
is
probably
due
the
peculiar
phenomenon
which
there
manifested
itself
to
careful
scrutiny
in
for
it
was
there
only
that
it
occurred
the
phenomenon
in
question
consisted
of
nicks
in
the
coastline
of
triangular
shape
and
filled
with
shading
they
occurred
at
intervals
along
it
and
were
of
the
general
form
of
carets
such
marks
as
one
makes
in
checking
items
down
a
list
their
position
was
always
where
a
canal
debouched
from
the
diaphragm
upon
its
career
across
the
open
continent
the
canal
itself
was
by
no
means
necessarily
visible
on
the
contrary
at
first
it
was
usually
absent
such
was
the
case
with
those
marking
the
of
the
phison
and
euphrates
and
of
the
amenthes
and
lethes
which
appeared
without
being
well
defined
from
the
moment
the
planet
came
to
be
scanned
one
by
one
these
carets
stood
out
to
view
punctuating
the
points
where
canals
later
were
to
show
or
terminating
those
that
already
existed
strung
thus
with
them
at
intervals
was
the
whole
coastline
of
the
diaphragm
beginning
with
the
mare
icarium
and
stretching
round
through
the
mare
tyrrhenum
mare
cimmerium
mare
sirenum
and
mare
erythraeum
to
the
mare
icarium
again
as
the
planet
got
nearer
to
the
earth
their
peculiar
shape
began
to
define
itself
and
it
was
again
in
the
case
of
those
giving
origin
to
the
phison
and
euphrates
that
the
recognition
came
first
what
had
appeared
earlier
simply
as
a
spot
now
stood
out
as
two
triangular
notches
indenting
the
coast
and
giving
exit
at
their
apices
the
eastern
one
to
the
phison
the
western
to
the
euphrates
these
were
the
things
then
that
had
constituted
the
portus
sigaeus
of
schiaparelli
commonly
the
carets
lie
at
the
bottom
of
bays
as
for
example
those
terminating
the
syrtis
minor
and
the
sinus
titanum
but
frequently
they
are
placed
in
the
very
midst
of
a
long
and
otherwise
unaccented
coast
as
is
the
case
in
of
the
mare
cimmerium
and
the
mare
sirenum
yet
in
no
instance
is
the
thing
unassociated
with
a
canal
in
every
case
one
or
more
canals
leave
the
caret
for
their
long
traverse
down
the
disk
this
is
not
their
only
canal
connection
when
the
canals
in
the
dark
regions
came
to
be
discovered
each
of
them
was
found
by
me
as
nearly
as
difficult
observations
would
permit
to
be
associated
with
the
caret
upon
its
other
side
thus
the
lacing
of
the
mare
cimmerium
and
sirenum
used
them
as
its
similarly
those
at
the
mouths
of
the
phison
and
euphrates
did
duty
likewise
to
the
maesolus
and
the
ion
in
such
manner
the
carets
stood
in
dual
relation
to
canals
subserving
a
purpose
to
the
canals
on
the
one
hand
and
to
the
ones
on
the
other
in
a
way
the
caret
then
holds
the
same
position
toward
the
canals
that
do
the
spots
in
the
light
or
dark
regions
like
them
it
is
a
point
unlike
them
however
in
shape
it
is
triangular
instead
of
round
and
we
are
piqued
to
inquire
to
what
cause
it
can
owe
its
different
contour
the
answer
seems
to
lie
in
the
character
of
the
locality
not
simply
in
its
complexion
for
the
spots
in
both
the
northern
and
the
southern
dark
patches
are
as
circular
as
those
standing
in
the
light
whether
they
lie
in
the
centre
or
upon
the
edges
of
them
the
edges
of
the
northern
patches
however
and
the
other
sides
of
the
southern
ones
do
not
present
the
character
of
the
northern
coast
of
the
diaphragm
where
they
seem
to
be
definitely
bounded
they
are
so
by
darker
canals
this
hints
that
their
contours
are
not
defined
by
antithesis
of
level
while
that
of
the
northern
coast
of
the
great
diaphragm
is
difference
of
altitude
is
then
concerned
in
their
constitution
the
canal
system
here
falls
to
a
lower
level
and
these
triangular
spots
instead
of
round
ones
are
the
result
topographic
only
such
explanation
leads
the
way
to
a
more
teleologic
one
and
serves
even
on
first
acquaintance
to
stir
curiosity
to
some
satisfying
cause
suggestive
in
several
ways
for
its
resemblance
to
the
carets
is
another
detail
not
far
distant
from
the
portus
sigaei
the
sabaeus
sinus
curiously
enough
this
feature
of
mars
which
has
been
well
known
and
recognized
ever
since
the
dawes
detected
it
more
than
forty
years
ago
proves
to
be
a
sort
of
connecting
link
between
the
main
markings
and
the
details
of
more
modern
detection
the
sabaeus
sinus
as
its
name
implies
is
of
the
form
of
a
double
bay
was
considered
to
be
one
in
fact
so
long
as
the
were
held
to
be
seas
it
straddles
the
point
of
land
which
called
the
fastigium
aryn
has
been
taken
for
the
greenwich
of
martian
longitudes
each
bay
in
truth
a
bay
at
the
ochre
in
an
acute
triangle
from
the
tip
of
which
many
canals
proceed
like
the
rays
of
a
fan
from
a
holding
hand
both
tips
are
darker
than
the
main
body
of
the
dark
from
which
they
proceed
they
thus
recall
in
general
character
the
carets
they
further
reproduce
specifically
the
portus
sigaei
for
they
give
origin
to
two
doubles
the
gihon
and
the
hiddekel
in
exactly
the
same
manner
that
the
two
nicks
of
the
portus
sigaei
do
to
the
phison
and
euphrates
nor
are
their
tips
much
farther
apart
than
those
of
the
portus
five
degrees
measuring
the
spread
of
the
one
and
four
degrees
that
of
the
other
respectively
the
reason
for
their
earlier
discovery
lying
in
their
greater
size
they
thus
perform
the
same
office
as
the
portus
sigaeus
are
quite
comparable
to
it
in
width
and
differ
in
shape
only
as
a
larger
and
more
acute
triangle
differs
from
a
smaller
and
blunter
one
undreamt
of
by
dawes
and
unheeded
since
they
were
the
first
hint
to
the
world
of
the
duality
which
forms
so
strangely
pervasive
a
feature
of
the
canal
system
of
the
planet
thus
the
carets
stand
connected
with
the
canals
quite
as
intimately
as
the
oases
but
in
a
significantly
different
manner
for
in
addition
to
their
intermediary
standing
between
the
light
regions
and
the
dark
their
relation
to
the
doubles
is
peculiar
an
instance
is
offered
by
the
double
euphrates
and
another
by
the
ganges
the
euphrates
as
we
saw
in
chapter
xviii
leaves
the
portus
sigaei
at
the
south
one
line
leaving
each
caret
centrally
so
that
each
caret
is
concerned
only
with
its
own
line
and
has
no
connection
with
its
fellow
at
their
northern
ends
both
lines
have
similarly
each
its
own
lucus
ismenius
the
like
seems
to
be
true
of
the
ganges
similarly
the
twin
titan
have
each
its
own
such
twin
duty
in
the
matter
of
doubles
seems
to
be
the
rule
with
the
carets
even
more
so
than
with
the
oases
and
this
is
probably
from
the
fact
that
the
coastline
is
of
more
limited
extent
than
the
interior
altogether
the
carets
offer
to
our
inspection
glosses
in
finer
print
upon
the
general
text
of
the
canals
thought
upon
what
they
show
takes
us
a
step
farther
toward
the
solution
of
the
strange
riddle
of
this
other
world
a
riddle
which
he
who
runs

not
read

and

only

without

in
accord
with
that
of
human
vision
speaking
broadly
however
it
is
so
little
complicated
a
machine
as
to
register
its
results
with
more
precision
than
the
retina
the
evidence
of
the
camera
has
thus
one
important
advantage
over
other
astronomic
documents
it
is
impersonally
trustworthy
in
what
it
states
bias
it
has
none
and
its
mistakes
are
few
imperfections
indeed
affect
it
but
they
are
of
purely
physical
occasion
and
may
be
eliminated
or
accounted
for
as
well
by
another
as
by
the
photographer
himself
in
trustworthiness
then
so
far
as
it
goes
it
stands
commended
not
so
much
may
be
said
of
its
ability
this
depends
upon
the
work
to
which
it
is
put
in
certain
lines
it
asserts
preëminence
in
certain
others
it
is
so
far
behind
as
to
be
out
of
the
race
the
reason
for
both
is
one
and
the
same
for
as
the
french
would
say
it
has
the
faults
of
its
quality
the
very
trait
that
fits
it
for
one
function
bars
it
from
the
other
this
excellence
is
that
by
which
the
tortoise
outstripped
the
hare
plodding
perseverance
far
less
sensitive
than
the
retina
the
dry
plate
has
one
advantage
over
its
rival
action
is
cumulative
the
eye
sees
all
it
can
in
the
twentieth
of
a
second
after
that
its
perception
instead
of
increasing
is
dulled
and
no
amount
of
application
will
result
in
adding
more
with
the
dry
plate
it
is
the
reverse
time
works
for
not
against
it
within
limits
themselves
long
light
affects
it
throughout
the
period
it
stands
exposed
and
roughly
speaking
in
direct
ratio
to
the
time
elapsed
thus
the
camera
is
able
to
record
stars
no
human
eye
has
ever
caught
and
to
register
the
structure
of
nebulæ
the
eye
tries
to
resolve
in
vain
where
illumination
alone
is
concerned
the
camera
reigns
supreme
not
so
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
definition
then
by
its
speed
and
agility
the
eye
steps
into
its
place
for
the
atmosphere
is
not
the
void
it
could
be
wished
through
which
the

pulsing
athwart
it
are
of
condensation
and
rarefaction
that
now
obstruct
now
further
the
passage
of
the

by
the
nimbleness
of
its
action
the
eye
cunningly
contrives
to
catch
the
good
moments
among
the
poor
and
carry
their
message
to
the
brain
the
dry
plate
by
its
slowness
is
impotent
to
follow
to
register
anything
it
must
take
the
bad
with
the
better
to
a
complete
confusion
of
detail
for
the
throw
the
image
first
to
one
place
and
then
to
another
to
a
blotting
of
both
all
of
which
renders
the
stars
where
lighting
counts
for
so
much
and
form
for
so
little
the
peculiar
province
of
celestial
photography
with
the
study
of
the
surfaces
of
the
planets
the
exact
contrary
is
the
case
with
most
of
them
illumination
is
already
to
be
had
in
abundance
definition
it
is
that
is
desired
what
succeeds
so
excellently
with
the
stars
is
here
put
to
it
to
do
anything
at
all
at
its
best
the
camera
is
hopelessly
behind
the
eye
when
it
comes
to
the
decipherment
of
planetary
detail
to
say
that
the
eye
is
ten
times
the
more
perceptive
is
not
to
overstep
the
mark
to
try
therefore
here
to
supplant
the
eye
by
the
camera
is
time
thrown
away
of
scant
importance
to
the
expert
in
such
matters
as
mars
there
is
a
side
of
the
subject
in
which
service
might
be
hoped
of
it
that
of
elementary
exposition
congenitally
incapable
of
competing
with
the
eye
in
discovery
the
most
that
by
any
possibility
could
be
looked
for
would
be
a
recording
of
the
coarser
details
after
the
fact
for
this
reason
it
had
long
been
a
purpose
at
flagstaff
to
photograph
some
at
least
of
the
canals
but
the
project
seemed
chimerical
to
get
an
image
suitable
at
all
some
seconds
of
exposure
would
be
required
and
during
such
time
the
shifting
would
blur
the
very
detail
desired
to
be
got
it
was
a
problem
of
essential
premises
mutually
annihilative
the
more
the
photographer
should
avoid
the
one
the
more
he
would
fall
into
the
other
nevertheless
the
thing
was
tried
in
in
the
subject
was
taken
up
by
lampland
then
new
at
the
observatory
the
results
were
better
than
those
of
two
years
before
the
images
more
but
still
incommunicable
of
canals
still
they
were
satisfactory
enough
to
spur
to
increased
endeavor
and
during
the
following
interopposition
preparations
were
made
to
grapple
with
the
planet
as
successfully
as
could
be
devised
at
its
next
return
this
happened
in
may
it
then
showed
a
disk
only
in
diameter
or
that
of
the
moon
this
disk
lampland
attacked
with
the
and
a
negative
amplificator
that
increased
the
focal
length
of
the
former
to
feet
at
such
focus
the
planet
s
image
was
received
upon
the
plate
everything
that
could
conduce
to
success
had
been
put
in
requisition
to
this
end
of
better
definition
the
color
curve
of
the
objective
was
first
got
and
for
it
a
special
color
screen
constructed
by
wallace
in
spite
of
its
name
no
achromatic
is
so
in
fact
but
brings
rays
of
different
tint
to
different
focus
the
color
curve
shows
where
these
severally
lie
and
the
color
screen
a
chemically
tinted
piece
of
glass
is
to
absorb
all
those
which
would
blur
the
image
by
having
a
different
focus
from
the
ones
retained
next
all
manner
of
plates
were
tried
for
in
these
again
it
was
necessary
to
reconcile
two
contradictory
characters
a
rapid
plate
and
a
one
for
the
coarser
the
grain
the
speedier
the
plate
and
coarse
grain
disfigures
the
detail
both
qualities
on
so
small
an
image
were
obligatory
and
yet
both
could
not
be
got
then
the
clock
had
to
be
as
as
possible
so
by
a
suggestion
of
cogshall
s
one
was
obtained
that
filled
this
requisite
a
new
form
of
conical
pendulum
upon
this
a
further
refinement
was
practiced
ordinarily
clockwork
is
timed
to
follow
the
stars
this
was
altered
to
follow
the
planet
and
so
keep
it
more
nearly
motionless
while
its
picture
was
being
taken
then
the
device
of
capping
down
the
telescope
to
suit
the
which
had
been
found
so
effective
to
the
bringing
out
of
fine
detail
was
put
in
practice
lastly
all
developers
were
tried
and
those
found
suited
to
the
finest
work
were
used
many
pictures
were
taken
on
each
plate
one
after
the
other
both
to
vary
the
exposure
and
to
catch
such
good
moments
as
might
chance
seven
hundred
images
were
thus
got
in
all
the
days
of
best
definition
alone
being
utilized
the
eagerness
with
which
the
first
plate
was
scanned
as
it
emerged
from
its
last
bath
may
be
imagined
and
the
joy
when
on
it
some
of
the
canals
could
certainly
be
seen
there
were
the
old
configurations
of
patches
the
light
areas
and
the
dark
just
as
they
looked
through
the
telescope
and
never
till
then
otherwise
seen
of
human
eye
and
there
more
marvelous
yet
were
the
grosser
of
those
lines
that
had
so
piqued
human
curiosity

who

now
read

the
seemingly

kinematic
so
far
in
our
account
of
the
phenomena
we
have
regarded
the
lines
the
spots
and
everything
that
is
theirs
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
appearance
at
any
one
time
in
other
words
we
have
viewed
them
only
from
a
static
standpoint
in
this
we
have
followed
the
course
of
the
facts
since
in
this
way
were
the
canals
first
observed
we
now
come
to
a
different
phase
of
the
matter
important
disclosure
with
continued
looking
that
these
strange
things
show
themselves
to
be
subject
to
change
that
is
they
take
on
a
kinematic
character
this
at
once
opens
a
fresh
field
of
inquiry
concerning
them
and
widens
the
horizon
of
research
it
increases
the
complexity
of
the
problem
but
at
the
same
time
makes
it
more
determinate
for
while
it
greatly
augments
the
number
of
facts
which
must
be
collected
toward
an
explanation
of
what
the
things
are
these
once
acquired
it
narrows
the
solution
which
can
apply
to
them
the
fact
of
change
in
the
martian
markings
forces
itself
upon
any
one
who
will
diligently
study
the
planet
he
will
be
inclined
at
first
to
attribute
it
to
observational
mistakes
of
his
own
or
his
predecessor
s
making
preferably
the
latter
but
eventually
his
own
delineations
will
prove
irreconcilable
with
one
another
and
he
will
then
realize
the
injustice
of
his
inference
and
will
put
the
cause
where
indeed
it
rightly
belongs
on
the
things
themselves
confronted
by
this
fact
he
will
the
more
fully
appreciate
how
long
and
systematic
must
be
the
study
of
him
who
would
penetrate
the
planet
s
peculiarity
just
as
the
recognition
of
something
akin
to
seasonal
change
came
to
schiaparelli
because
of
his
attending
to
the
planet
with
an
assiduity
unknown
to
his
predecessors
so
it
became
evident
that
to
learn
the
laws
of
these
changes
and
from
them
the
meaning
of
the
markings
there
was
necessary
as
full
and
as
continuous
a
record
of
them
as
it
was
possible
to
obtain
for
this
end
it
was
not
enough
to
get
observations
from
time
to
time
however
good
these
might
be
but
to
secure
as
nearly
as
might
be
a
complete
succession
of
such
day
after
day
month
after
month
and
opposition
after
opposition
the
outcome
justified
the
deduction
and
it
is
specially
gratifying
to
realize
that
to
no
one
have
the
method
and
the
results
thus
obtained
appealed
with
more
force
than
to
schiaparelli
himself
perseverance
in
scanning
the
disk
long
after
the
casual
observer
had
considered
it
too
far
away
for
observational
purposes
resulted
in
schiaparelli
s
detection
of
the
canals
and
this
through
a
characteristic
of
theirs
destined
to
play
a
great
part
in
their
history
their
susceptibility
to
change
he
tells
us
in
his
how
aeria
and
the
adjoining
regions
showed
blank
of
any
markings
while
the
planet
was
near
in
and
the
disk
large
and
well
shown
and
then
how
to
his
surprise
as
the
planet
got
farther
away
and
the
disk
shrank
lines
began
to
come
out
in
the
region
with
unmistakable
certainty
thus
to
the
very
variability
which
had
hidden
them
to
others
was
due
in
schiaparelli
s
hands
their
initial
recognition
flux
affecting
the
canals
was
apparent
from
the
outset
of
my
own
observations
no
less
the
subject
of
transformation
than
the
large
dark
regions
was
the
network
of
tenuous
lines
that
overspread
them
at
times
they
were
very
hard
to
make
out
and
then
again
they
were
comparatively
easy
distance
instead
of
rendering
them
more
difficult
frequently
did
the
reverse
nor
was
the
matter
one
of
veiling
neither
our
own
atmosphere
nor
that
of
mars
showed
itself
in
any
way
responsible
for
their
temporary
disappearance
it
was
not
always
when
our
atmospheric
conditions
were
best
that
the
lines
stood
out
most
clearly
and
as
to
martian
meteorology
there
was
no
sign
that
it
had
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
obliteration
long
before
the
canals
were
dreamt
of
veiling
by
martian
clouds
or
mist
had
been
considered
the
cause
of
those
changes
in
the
planet
s
general
features
which
are
too
extensive
and
wholly
to
escape
observation
even
though
none
too
clearly
seen
it
was
early
evident
to
me
that
they
were
not
the
cause
of
general
topographic
change
and
equally
clearly
as
inoperative
in
those
that
affected
the
canals
in
short
nothing
extrinsic
to
the
canal
caused
its
disappearance
whatever
the
change
was
its
action
lay
intrinsic
to
the
canal
itself
on
occasion
canals
in
whole
regions
appeared
to
be
blotted
out
the
most
careful
scrutiny
would
fail
to
disclose
them
where
some
time
before
they
had
been
perfectly
clear
and
this
though
distance
was
at
its
minimum
and
definition
at
its
best
even
the
strongest
marked
of
the
strange
pencil
lines
would
show
at
times
only
as
ghosts
of
their
former
selves
while
for
their
more
delicate
companions
it
taxed
one
s
faith
to
believe
that
they
could
ever
really
have
existed
illumination
was
invoked
to
account
for
this
and
plays
a
part
in
the
effect
undoubtedly
for
at
plumb
opposition
the
centre
of
the
disk
for
two
or
three
years
has
shown
less
detail
than
before
and
after
that
event
this
is
probably
due
not
as
with
the
moon
to
the
withdrawal
of
shadows
but
to
the
greater
glare
to
which
the
disk
is
then
subjected
but
this
is
not
the
chief
cause
of
the
change
still
more
striking
and
unaccountable
was
the
fact
that
each
canal
had
its
own
times
and
seasons
for
showing
or
remaining
hid
each
had
its
entrances
upon
the
scene
and
its
exits
from
it
what
dated
the
one
left
another
unaffected
the
nilokeras
was
to
be
seen
when
the
chrysorrhoas
was
invisible
and
the
jamuna
perfectly
evident
when
the
indus
could
scarcely
be
made
out

so
much
shows
in
the

of
the

the

of
the
chrysorrhoas

noticeable
in

ii
seasonal
changes
seemed
the
only
thing
to
account
for
the
phenomena
and
in
a
general
sense
this
was
undoubtedly
the
explanation
to
learn
more
about
the
matter
to
verify
it
if
it
existed
and
to
particularize
it
if
possible
i
determined
to
undertake
an
investigation
permitting
of
quantitative
precision
in
the
case
a
method
of
doing
this
occurred
to
me
which
would
yield
results
deserving
of
consideration
from
the
amount
of
data
upon
which
each
was
based
and
capable
of
being
compared
with
one
another
upon
an
equal
footing
from
which
relative
information
could
be
derived
it
seemed
wise
to
determine
from
the
drawings
the
degree
of
visibility
of
a
given
canal
at
different
seasons
of
the
martian
year
and
then
to
do
this
for
every
important
canal
during
the
same
period
of
time
the
great
number
of
the
drawings
suggested
this
use
to
which
they
might
be
put
for
from
a
great
accumulation
of
data
a
set
of
statistics
on
the
subject
could
be
secured
in
which
accident
or
bias
would
be
largely
eliminated
and
the
telling
effect
of
averages
make
itself
felt
to
render
this
possible
it
was
necessary
that
the
drawings
should
be
alike
numerous
consecutive
and
extended
in
time
these
conditions
were
fulfilled
by
the
drawings
made
by
me
at
the
opposition
of
three
hundred
and
drawings
had
then
been
secured
and
they
covered
between
them
a
period
of
six
months
and
a
half
they
were
also
as
consecutive
as
it
was
possible
to
secure
during
a
part
of
the
period
the
planet
was
seen
and
drawn
at
every
hours
from
april
namely
to
may
or
for
consecutive
days
though
the
rest
of
the
time
did
not
equal
this
perfection
no
great
gap
occurred
and
one
hundred
and
nights
were
utilized
in
all
furthermore
as
these
drawings
were
all
made
by
one
man
the
personal
equation
of
the
very
important
source
of
deviation
where
drawings
are
to
be
eliminated
but
even
this
does
not
give
an
idea
of
the
mass
of
the
data
for
by
the
method
employed
about
drawings
were
used
in
the
case
of
each
canal
and
as
canals
were
examined
this
gave
separate
determinations
upon
which
the
ultimate
result
depended
that
each
of
these
determinations
was
independent
of
the
others
will
appear
from
a
description
of
the
method
itself
on
which
the
investigation
was
conducted
to
understand
that
method
one
must
begin
a
little
way
back
as
the
two
planets
mars
and
the
earth
turn
on
their
axes
the
parts
of
their
surfaces
they
present
to
each
other
are
constantly
changing
for
a
feature
on
mars
to
be
visible
from
a
given
post
on
earth
observer
and
observed
must
confront
each
other
and
furthermore
it
must
be
day
there
when
it
is
night
here
but
as
mars
takes
about
forty
minutes
longer
to
turn
than
the
earth
such
confronting
occurs
later
and
later
each
night
by
about
forty
minutes
until
finally
it
does
not
occur
at
all
while
mars
is
suitably
above
the
horizon
then
the
feature
passes
from
sight
to
remain
hidden
till
the
difference
of
the
rotations
brings
it
round
into
view
again
there
are
thus
times
when
a
given
region
is
visible
times
when
it
is
not
and
these
succeed
each
other
in
from
five
to
six
weeks
and
are
called
presentations
for
about
a
fortnight
at
each
presentation
a
region
is
centrally
enough
placed
to
be
well
seen
for
the
rest
of
the
period
either
or
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
if
a
marking
were
always
salient
enough
it
would
appear
in
every
drawing
made
of
the
disk
during
the
recurrent
fortnights
of
its
display
if
it
were
weaker
than
this
it
might
appear
on
some
drawings
and
not
on
others
dependent
upon
its
own
strength
and
upon
the
definition
at
the
moment
and
we
should
have
a
certain
percentage
of
visibility
for
it
at
that
presentation
while
if
it
changed
in
strength
between
one
presentation
and
the
next
the
percentage
of
its
recording
would
change
likewise
definition
of
course
is
always
varying
but
if
its
value
be
noted
at
the
time
of
each
drawing
this
factor
may
be
allowed
for
more
or
less
successfully
making
such
allowance
together
with
other
corrections
to
produce
extrinsic
equality
such
as
the
planet
s
distance
which
we
need
not
enter
upon
here
we
are
left
with
only
the
marking
s
intrinsic
visibility
to
affect
the
percentages
that
is
the
percentages
tell
of
the
changes
it
has
successively
undergone
and
give
us
a
history
of
its
wax
and
wane
from
drawings
accurately
made
it
is
possible
to
add
to
the
accuracy
of
the
percentage
by
noting
in
each
not
only
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
marking
but
the
degree
of
strength
with
which
it
is
represented
this
was
done
on
the
final
investigation
in
the
present
case
and
it
was
interesting
to
note
how
little
difference
it
made
in
the
result
the
longitude
of
each
canal
was
known
and
the
longitude
of
the
central
meridian
of
each
drawing
was
always
calculated
and
tabulated
with
the
drawing
so
that
it
was
possible
to
tell
which
drawings
might
have
shown
the
canal
only
when
the
position
of
the
canal
was
within
a
certain
number
of
degrees
of
the
centre
of
the
drawing
was
the
drawing
used
in
the
result
allowance
being
duly
made
for
the
loss
upon
the
phase
side
each
drawing
it
should
be
remembered
was
as
nearly
an
instantaneous
picture
of
the
disk
as
possible
it
covered
only
a
few
minutes
of
observation
and
was
made
practically
as
if
the
observer
had
never
seen
the
planet
before
in
other
words
the
man
was
sunk
in
the
manner
such
mental
effacement
is
as
vital
to
good
observation
as
mental
assertion
is
afterward
to
pregnant
reasoning
for
a
man
should
be
a
machine
in
collecting
his
data
a
mind
in
coördinating
them
to
reverse
the
process
as
is
sometimes
done
is
not
conducive
to
science
when
the
successive
true
percentages
of
visibility
of
a
given
canal
had
thus
been
found
they
were
plotted
vertically
at
points
along
a
horizontal
line
corresponding
in
distance
from
the
origin
to
the
number
of
days
after
or
before
the
summer
solstice
of
the
martian
northern
hemisphere
the
horizontal
distance
thus
measured
the
time
while
the
vertical
height
gave
the
relative
visibility
the
points
so
plotted
were
then
joined
by
a
smooth
curve
this
curve
reproduced
the
continuous
change
in
visibility
undergone
by
the
canal
during
the
period
under
observation
it
gave
a
graphic
picture
of
the
canal
s
change
of
state
it
seemed
therefore
proper
to
call
it
the
canal
s
cartouche
or
sign
manual
in
this
manner
were
obtained
the
cartouches
of
canals
now
as
the
presence
or
absence
of
any
canal
in
any
drawing
was
entirely
irrespective
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
another
each
such
datum
spoke
only
for
itself
and
was
an
entirely
independent
observation
the
whole
investigation
thus
rested
on
completely
separate
determinations
each
as
unconditioned
by
the
others
as
if
it
existed
alone
as
every
factor
outside
of
the
canal
itself
which
could
affect
the
latter
s
visibility
was
taken
account
of
and
the
correction
due
to
it
as
nearly
as
possible
applied
before
the
cartouches
were
deduced
the
latter
represent
the
visibility
of
the
canal
to
intrinsic
change
in
other
words
they
give
not
the
apparent
only
but
the
real
history
of
the
canal
for
the
period
concerned
important
disclosures
result
from
inspection
of
the
cartouches
this
we
shall
perceive
by
considering
what
different
curves
mean
in
the
case
if
the
canal
were
an
unchangeable
phenomenon
for
any
reason
whatever
its
cartouche
would
be
a
line
parallel
to
the
of
the
diagram
this
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
the
visibility
would
then
never
vary
if
on
the
other
hand
it
were
waxing
and
waning
and
the
wax
or
wane
were
uniform
the
cartouche
would
be
a
straight
line
to
the
rising
if
the
canal
were
increasing
falling
when
it
decreased
lastly
if
the
rate
of
change
itself
varied
the
cartouche
would
be
a
curve
concave
or
convex
to
the
line
denoting
the
time
according
as
the
rate
of
change
of
the
growth
or
decay
grew
greater
or
less
to
see
this
the
more
clearly
we
may
set
over
against
the
cartouche
the
canal
character
it
signalizes
cartouche
character
a
horizontal
straight
line
canal
invariable
a
straight
line
tilted
up
on
the
right
canal
increasing
steadily
a
straight
line
tilted
up
on
the
left
canal
decreasing
steadily
a
curved
line
descending
concave
from
canal
decreasing
but
more
above
and
more
slowly
a
curved
line
ascending
concave
from
canal
increasing
but
more
above
and
more
rapidly
a
curved
line
descending
convex
from
canal
decreasing
more
and
above
more
rapidly
a
curved
line
ascending
convex
from
canal
increasing
more
and
above
more
slowly
a
curved
line
first
descending
then
canal
decreasing
more
and
ascending
concave
from
above
more
slowly
to
a
minimum
throughout
thence
increasing
more
and
more
rapidly
a
curved
line
first
descending
then
canal
increasing
more
and
ascending
convex
from
above
more
slowly
to
a
maximum
throughout
thence
decreasing
more
and
more
rapidly
if
the
cartouche
first
falls
and
then
rises
this
shows
the
canal
to
have
passed
through
a
minimum
state
at
the
time
denoted
by
the
point
of
inflection
if
it
rises
first
and
falls
afterward
this
betokens
in
the
same
way
a
maximum
thus
the
cartouches
reveal
to
us
the
complete
history
of
the
canals
changes
they
underwent
and
the
times
at
which
these
occurred
the
cartouche
then
is
the
graphic
portrayal
of
the
canal
s
behavior
it
not
only
distinguishes
at
once
between
the
dead
and
the
living
as
we
may
call
the
effect
of
intrinsic
change
but
it
tells
the
exact
character
of
this
change
way
it
varied
from
time
to
time
the
epoch
at
which
the
development
was
at
its
minimum
or
its
maximum
for
any
given
canal
and
lastly
its
actual
strength
at
any
time
thus
giving
its
relative
importance
in
the
canal
system
for
the
height
of
the
curve
above
the
diagrammatic
horizon
marks
the
absolute
as
well
as
the
relative
visibility
and
enables
us
to
rank
the
canals
between
themselves
now
the
first
point
it
furnishes
a
criterion
for
is
the
real
or
illusory
character
of
the
canals
if
a
line
be
due
to
illusion
whether
optical
or
physical
it
can
vary
only
from
extrinsic
cause
since
it
has
no
intrinsic
existence
if
therefore
all
extrinsic
cause
be
allowed
for
the
cartouche
of
this
ghost
must
needs
be
a
straight
even
if
the
extrinsic
factors
to
its
production
be
imperfectly
accounted
for
their
retention
could
only
cause
systematic
variations
from
the
straight
line
in
all
the
lines
which
would
themselves
vary
systematically
and
these
factors
could
therefore
be
detected
this
criterion
is
absolute
unless
all
the
cartouches
were
approximately
straight
lines
no
illusion
theory
of
any
kind
whatever
could
explain
the
facts
even
then
the
lines
might
all
be
real
for
unchangeable
reality
would
produce
the
same
effect
on
the
cartouches
as
illusion
in
the
case
therefore
of
horizontal
straight
line
cartouches
we
should
have
no
guarantee
on
that
score
of
reality
or
illusion
but
on
the
other
hand
curves
or
inclined
straight
lines
in
them
would
be
instantly
fatal
to
all
illusion
theories
turning
now
to
the
cartouches
obtained
in
the
first
point
to
strike
one
s
notice
is
that
all
but
three
of
them
are
curves
and
that
even
these
three
must
be
accepted
with
a
caveat
here
then
the
cartouches
dispose
once
and
for
all
of
any
and
every
illusion
theory
they
show
conclusively
that
the
canals
are
real
objects
which
wax
and
wane
from
some
intrinsic
cause
the
second
result
afforded
by
the
cartouches
is
not
of
a
destructive
negative
character
valuable
the
destruction
of
bars
to
knowledge
may
be
of
a
constructive
positive
one
it
does
not
like
the
first
follow
from
mere
inspection
but
is
brought
to
light
only
by
comparison
of
all
the
cartouches
in
a
positive
way
therefore
its
testimony
is
as
conclusive
as
it
was
in
a
negative
direction
for
that
separate
and
independent
data
should
result
in
a
general
law
of
development
through
either
conscious
or
unconscious
bias
when
those
data
would
have
to
be
combined
in
so
complicated
a
manner
for
the
result
to
emerge
as
is
here
the
case
is
impossible
chance
could
not
do
it
and
consciousness
would
require
a
coördinate
memory
to
which
murphy
s
nine
games
of
chess
at
once
would
be
child
s
play
of
the
canals
examined
showed
by
their
cartouches
that
they
had
been
during
the
whole
or
a
part
of
the
period
in
a
state
of
change
but
the
change
was
not
the
same
for
all
in
some
the
minimum
came
early
in
others
late
some
decreased
to
nothing
and
stayed
there
others
increased
from
zero
and
were
increasing
still
at
the
time
observations
closed
latitude
proved
the
means
of
bringing
comparative
order
out
of
the
chaos
when
the
canals
were
ranged
according
to
their
latitude
on
the
planet
a
law
in
their
development
came
to
light
to
understand
it
the
circumstances
under
which
the
canals
were
presented
must
be
considered
as
regards
the
then
season
of
the
planet
s
year
in
the
planet
passed
on
february
through
the
point
of
its
orbit
where
the
summer
solstice
of
the
northern
hemisphere
occurs
one
hundred
and
days
later
took
place
the
first
snowfall
in
the
arctic
and
subarctic
regions
an
event
that
denoted
the
beginning
of
the
new
polar
cap
from
which
date
the
snow
there
gradually
increased
its
autumnal
equinox
the
planet
did
not
reach
till
august
now
the
canals
were
observed
from
days
before
the
summer
solstice
of
the
northern
hemisphere
to
one
hundred
and
days
after
that
event
we
may
tabulate
the

it
appears
that
the
cartouches
cover
the
development
of

about

to

of
the
martian

the

included
all
the
more
conspicuous
canals
on
the
planet
at
that
opposition
all
those
that
lent
themselves
by
the
sufficient
frequency
with
which
they
were
seen
to
a
statistical
result
they
lay
spread
all
the
way
between
the
edge
of
the
polar
cap
in
latitude
north
to
the
extreme
limit
south
at
which
the
then
tilt
of
the
north
pole
toward
the
earth
permitted
of
canal
recognition
this
southern
limit
was
in
about
latitude
south
farther
south
than
this
vision
became
too
oblique
amounting
as
it
did
with
an
adverse
tilt
of
degrees
to
start
with
to
something
over
sixty
degrees
for
detection
of
such
fine
markings
to
be
possible
between
the
two
limits
thus
imposed
by
the
perpetual
snow
on
the
one
side
and
the
observational

on

were

of

the

comprised
each
a

of

about

the

solely
because
in
part
occupied
by
the
permanent

cap
the
curves
of
all
the
canals
in
a
given
zone
have
been
combined
into
a
mean
curve
or
cartouche
for
that
zone
and
then
the
cartouches
for
the
several
zones
have
been
represented
and
ranged
according
to
latitude
on
the
accompanying
plate
consideration
of
these
mean
canal
cartouches
is
very
instructive
in
the
first
place
not
one
of
them
is
a
straight
line
either
horizontal
or
inclined
all
are
curves
and
with
the
exception
of
the
top
one
all
show
a
minimum
or
lowest
point
during
the
period
under
observation
from
this
point
they
rise
with
the
time
or
to
the
right
on
the
plate
a
black
star
marks
this
minimum
and
is
found
farther
and
farther
to
the
right
as
one
goes
down
the
plate
that
is
as
one
travels
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
arctic
regions
down
to
the
equator
and
then
over
into
the
planet
s
southern
hemisphere
drawing
now
a
line
approximately
through
the
stars
and
remembering
that
the
minimum
means
the
date
at
which
the
canal
started
to
develop
we
see
that
the
canal
development
began
at
the
border
of
the
north
polar
cap
and
thence
continued
down
the
disk
over
the
planet
s
surface
as
far
as
observation
permitted
the
surface
to
be
seen
which
was
some
degrees
into
the
other
hemisphere
this
is
the
first
broad
fact
disclosed
by
the
cartouches
illustration
canal
furthermore
the
development
took
place
at
an
approximately
uniform
rate
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
line
passing
through
the
black
stars
is
approximately
straight
for
such
straightness
means
that
progression
down
the
disk
as
measured
by
the
latitude
bore
throughout
the
same
ratio
to
the
time
elapsed
looking
at
them
again
we
notice
that
the
three
topmost
cartouches
those
of
the
north
polar
arctic
and
canals
respectively
dip
at
the
right
before
the
end
of
the
observations
while
the
other
seven
were
still
rising
when
those
observations
were
brought
to
a
close
a
reason
for
this
or
at
least
a
significant
coincidence
is
to
be
found
in
the
dotted
line
pendent
from
the
top
of
the
table
and
labelled
first
this
dotted
line
denotes
the
date
at
which
the
first
extensive
frost
occurred
in
the
polar
regions
for
even
before
this
time
patches
of
white
had
appeared
north
of
the
mare
acidalium
denoting
the
of
the
cold
the
frost
did
not
last
but
came
and
went
and
came
again
just
as
it
does
on
earth
growing
more
insistent
and
at
each
fresh
fall
its
sphere
of
operation
was
confined
to
the
three
zones
in
question
even
these
zones
it
by
no
means
covered
merely
blotching
them
in
places
with
patches
of
frost
beyond
them
south
it
never
extended
during
the
period
of
the
observations
indeed
it
hardly
entered
the
zone
at
all
at
this
very
beginning
of
the
polar
winter
for
it
was
only
august
then
the
coincidence
of
the
isotherm
as
betrayed
by
the
deposition
of
frost
with
the
dividing
line
between
the
curves
that
dip
down
at
this
season
and
those
that
still
continue
to
rise
is
suggestive
it
becomes
all
the
more
so
when
the
three
cartouches
are
considered
seriatim
the
most
polewards
the
north
polar
one
had
sunk
to
zero
sometime
before
the
first
extensive
frost
occurred
the
second
the
arctic
did
so
later
than
its
northern
neighbor
probably
just
before
the
epoch
in
question
while
the
third
practically
outside
the
zone
of
deposition
was
behind
both
the
others
in
its
descent
inspection
of
the
drawings
upon
which
the
cartouches
are
based
confirms
an
inference
deduced
from
this
that
it
was
cold
that
killed
not
frost
that
covered
them
which
was
responsible
for
their
obliteration
the
drawings
show
that
the
canals
ceased
to
be
seen
before
the
white
patches
were
evident
now
this
would
be
the
exact
behavior
of
vegetation
it
would
be
killed
turned
brown
by
freezing
and
so
rendered
invisible
to
us
against
its
ochre
desert
background
before
the
cold
had
grown
intense
enough
to
cover
that
ground
with
a
solid
white
carpet
of
frost
at
the
opposition
of
however
the
extreme
northern
canals
were
visible
after
the
snow
had
covered
all
the
country
about
them
being
evident
as
lines
threading
the
new
cap
these
three
cartouches
furthermore
show
each
a
maximum
and
what
is
significant
the
maximum
occurs
later
in
time
for
each
according
as
the
zone
lies
remote
from
the
pole
a
red
star
marks
this
maximum
and
shows
that
the
time
of
greatest
development
for
the
three
zones
was
respectively
days
after
the
summer
solstice
for
the
north
polar
days
after
the
summer
solstice
for
the
arctic
days
after
the
summer
solstice
for
the
we
now
pass
to
the
other
curves
those
that
were
unaffected
by
cold
though
in
these
the
minima
themselves
show
the
law
of
latitudinal
progression
the
wavelike
character
of
the
advance
is
even
better
disclosed
by
the
curves
as
the
eye
follows
them
down
the
page
the
advance
of
the
wave
to
the
right
is
plainly
apparent
the
slope
of
the
wave
is
much
the
same
for
all
implying
that
a
like
force
was
at
work
successively
down
the
latitudes
it
will
be
noticed
next
that
in
all
the
mean
cartouches
the
gradient
is
greater
after
the
minimum
than
before
it
the
curves
fall
gently
to
their
lowest
points
and
rise
more
steeply
from
them
such
profile
indicates
that
the
effects
of
a
previous
force
were
slowly
dying
out
down
to
the
minimum
and
that
then
an
impulse
started
in
to
act
afresh
this
explains
the
attitude
of
the
canals
that
died
out
in
them
the
effect
of
the
old
force
shows
as
in
the
others
but
no
impulse
came
in
their
case
to
resuscitation
it
seems
possible
to
trace
this
force
to
an
origin
at
the
south
for
beginning
with
the
north
zone
the
gradient
on
the
left
shows
less
and
less
steep
southward
to
the
south
zone
such
a
swell
is
what
should
be
looked
for
in
an
impulse
which
had
travelled
from
the
south
northward
since
the
wave
would
affect
the
more
northern
zones
last
and
less
of
a
calm
period
would
intervene
between
the
two
impulses
from
opposite
poles
the
cartouches
then
state
that
the
canals
began
to
develop
after
the
greatest
melting
of
the
polar
cap
had
occurred
that
this
development
proceeded
down
the
latitudes
to
the
equator
and
then
not
stopping
there
advanced
up
the
latitudes
of
the
other
hemisphere
in
the
next
place
they
show
that
in
the
arctic
region
the
development
was
arrested
and
devolution
or
decay
set
in
as
it
began
to
get
cold
there
the
most
northern
canals
being
affected
first
finally
that
a
similar
wave
of
evolution
had
occurred
from
the
opposite
pole
some
time
before
and
had
then
passed
away
and
this
evidence
of
the
cartouches
is
direct
and
independent
of
any
theory

canal
development
as
an
interesting
instance
of
the
law
of
development
we
may
take
the
career
of
the
brontes
during
this
same
martian
year
the
brontes
witnessing
individually
to
the
same
evolutionary
process
that
the
canals
collectively
exhibit
the
brontes
is
one
of
the
most
imposing
canals
upon
the
planet
it
is
not
so
much
its
length
which
renders
it
a
striking
object
though
this
length
is
enough
to
entitle
it
to
consideration
being
no
less
than
miles
its
direction
is
what
singles
it
out
to
notice
for
it
runs
almost
north
and
south
for
this
reason
it
swings
into
a
position
to
hold
the
centre
of
the
stage
for
a
time
with
the
precision
of
a
meridian
as
the
planet
s
rotation
turns
its
longitude
into
view
the
points
which
it
connects
help
also
to
add
to
its
distinction
for
the
sinus
titanum
at
its
southern
end
and
the
propontis
at
its
northern
are
both
among
the
conspicuous
points
of
the
disk
the
latter
is
but
twelve
degrees
farther
east
than
the
former
while
it
is
degrees
farther
north
this
long
distance
nearly
the
line
of
the
tropics
in
the
southern
hemisphere
to
regions
of
the
northern
canal
runs
in
an
absolutely
straight
course
its
north
and
south
character
commends
it
for
any
investigation
of
canal
development
since
it
runs
in
the
general
direction
that
development
takes
its
great
latitudinal
stretch
further
fits
it
for
a
recorder
of
changes
sweeping
down
the
disk
so
that
both
in
direction
and
length
it
stands
well
circumstanced
for
a
measure
of
latitudinal
variations
the
fact
that
it
is
usually
a
fairly
conspicuous
canal
does
not
detract
from
its
virtue
in
this
respect
it
was
first
recognized
at
flagstaff
in
but
once
realized
so
to
speak
it
was
possible
to
identify
it
with
a
canal
seen
by
schiaparelli
and
supposed
by
him
to
be
the
titan
indeed
it
played
hide
and
seek
with
that
canal
throughout
his
drawings
in
both
it
and
the
titan
were
so
well
seen
that
its
separate
existence
was
unmistakable
causing
it
to
be
both
recognized
and
named
it
is
like
the
titan
one
of
the
sheaf
of
canals
descending
the
disk
from
the
sinus
titanum
and
lies
just
to
the
east
of
the
titan
in
the
bunch
in
it
was
also
prominent
and
at
both
these
oppositions
most
so
from
its
southern
end
its
northern
one
being
more
or
less
indefinite
especially
in
in
it
was
not
the
same
instead
of
being
the
conspicuous
canal
it
had
been
in
earlier
years
it
was
now
so
faint
as
with
difficulty
to
be
made
out
it
remained
so
to
the
close
of
observations
it
was
now
under
suspicion
its
behavior
in
had
led
to
the
supposition
that
not
only
were
seasonal
changes
taking
place
in
it
but
that
those
changes
were
such
as
to
point
to
a
law
in
the
case
with
which
its
conduct
in
fayed
in
the
suspicion
did
not
however
become
a
certainty
till
the
opposition
of
the
length
of
time
during
which
the
disk
was
then
kept
under
scrutiny
resulted
in
the
method
of
its
metamorphosis
being
discovered

the

its

off
was
the

that
only
its
northern

could
be

as

this

was
the
stronger
the

decidedly
inconspicuous

only
served
to
accentuate
its
relative
inconspicuousness
for
it
showed
now
notably
inferior
to
the
northern
canals
and
this
not
only
in
the
matter
of
general
visibility
but
in
the
character
it
displayed
it
was
a

hazy

the

that

its

may
this
contrariety
of

had
about
it

very
telling

even

something
more
of
vividness
however
is
imparted
by
the
actual
look
of
one
of
the
constituents
during

it
is
the
difference
between

the
gazing

yield
a

than
a

affording

treated
as

to
consider
a

parts

by
so

hibernation
of
the
canals
connected
with
the
conduct
of
the
canals
is
a
phenomenon
examples
of
which
were
early
noted
in
a
general
way
by
schiaparelli
and
later
but
of
which
the
full
import
and
exhibition
only
came
to
light
during
the
opposition
of
by
a
very
striking
metamorphosis
what
may
be
called
the
hibernation
of
a
canal
for
a
longer
or
shorter
term
of
years
what
observation
discloses
is
certainly
curious
for
several
successive
oppositions
a
canal
will
be
seen
in
a
definite
locality
as
regular
in
seasonal
recurrence
as
it
is
permanent
in
place
a
feature
of
the
disk
then
to
one
s
surprise
with
the
next
return
of
the
planet
it
will
fail
to
appear
and
will
proceed
to
remain
obliterate
without
assignable
cause
for
many
martian
years
until
as
unexpectedly
it
will
be
found
what
and
where
it
was
before
neither
to
deposition
of
such
as
frequently
whitens
whole
regions
of
mars
nor
to
other
circumstances
can
be
attributed
its
disappearance
without
apparent
reason
it
simply
ceases
to
be
and
then
as
simply
comes
back
again
such
bopeep
behavior
is
quite
beyond
and
apart
from
the
seasonal
change
in
visibility
to
which
all
the
canals
are
by
their
nature
subject
for
being
creatures
of
the
unlocking
of
the
water
congealed
about
the
polar
caps
they
quicken
into
growth

each
in
its
season
and
as
regularly
die
out
again
different
however
is
the
phenomenon
to
which
i
now
refer
in
it
not
a
seasonal
but
a
secular
change
is
concerned
the
season
proper
to
the
canal
s
increase
will
recur
in
due
course
and
the
canals
round
about
it
will
start
to
life
yet
the
canal
remains
unquickened
nothing
responds
where
in
years
the
response
was
immediate
and
invariable
the
canal
lies
dormant
spite
of
seasonal
solicitation
to
stir
such
curious
hibernation
was
early
hinted
to
the
keenness
of
schiaparelli
and
most
incomprehensible
as
well
as
difficult
of
verification
at
that
stage
the
phenomenon
was
that
the
absence
was
a
fact
however
he
assured
himself
although
he
was
not
able
to
prove
an
alibi
but
at
the
last
opposition
an
event
of
the
sort
occurred
which
from
the
length
of

the

was
kept
under

continued

a
point
now
known
to
be
occupied
by
the
oasis
called
aquae
calidae
the
thoth
started
south
inclining
westward
as
it
went
till
in
longitude
and
latitude
north
it
met
the
triton
which
had
come
from
the
syrtis
minor
with
similar
westward
inclination
to
the
same
point
in
the
same
manner
came
the
nepenthes
part
way
along
the
course
of
the
latter
was
to
be
seen
a
small
dark
spot
the
lucus
moeris
which
he
estimated
at
four
degrees
in
diameter
some
of
the
markings
were
easier
than
others
the
easiest
of
all
being
the
lucus
tritonis
a
largish
dark
spot
at
the
common
intersection
of
all
three
canals
but
that
none
of
the
markings
were
remarkably
difficult
is
sufficiently
shown
by
their
detection
at
this
early
stage
of
schiaparelli
s
observations
it
is
worth
noting
also
that
he
discovered
the
southern
ones
first
the
thoth
not
being
seen
till
march
as
his
then
recognition
of
these
canals
witnesses
they
must
have
been
among
the
most
evident
on
the
disk
and
the
point
is
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
he
failed
at
this
opposition
to
detect
the
phison
and
the
euphrates
as
separate
markings
much
the
same
the
three
canals
appeared
to
him
at
the
next
opposition
of
the
thoth
being
seen
at
its
several
presentations
from
october
to
january
at
the
next
opposition
a
noteworthy
alteration
occurred
the
full
significance
of
which
escaped
recognition
schiaparelli
saw
at
the
place
where
the
thoth
had
been
two
lines
which
he
took
for
a
gemination
of
that
canal
one
of
which
followed
the
course
of
the
old
thoth
while
the
other
went
straight
from
the
sinus
alcyonius
to
the
little
syrtis
or
more
precisely
to
the
junction
of
the
triton
and
the
lethes
it
was
not
the
thoth
however
but
something
unsuspected
of
more
importance
in
the
thoth
showed
really
double
the
western
line
being
much
the
stronger
una
delle

vedessero
sul
that
neither
branch
went
farther
than
the
with
the
nepenthes
argues
that
it
was
indeed
the
thoth
that
was
seen
schiaparelli
himself
had
no
doubt
on
the
subject
although
he
drew
the
double
canal
he
saw
due
north
and
south
from
the
tip
of
the
sinus
alcyonius
to
the
junction
but
nevertheless
along
the
meridian
in
and
the
system
was
in
all
essentials
what
it
had
been
in
and
except
that
the
thoth
and
nepenthes
were
double
and
were
more
minutely
seen
here
then
was
a
system
of
canals
and
spots
which
for
six
martian
years
had
been
a
persistent
and
substantially
invariable
feature
of
the
martian
surface
any
changes
in
it
had
been
of
a
secondary
order
of
importance
while
its
general
visibility
was
of
the
first
it
is
possible
then
to
judge
of
my
perplexity
when
in
beginning
my
observations
in
no
sign
of
the
system
could
i
detect
of
neither
the
thoth
the
triton
the
nepenthes
nor
the
lucus
moeris
was
there
trace
and
yet
from
the
other
canals
visible
it
was
evident
that
the
disk
was
quite
as
well
seen
as
it
had
been
by
schiaparelli
not
only
were
practically
all
his
canals
there
but
many
much
smaller
ones
were
to
be
made
out
and
the
same
was
true
of
the
spots
a
host
of
such
not
figured
by
him
appearing
here
and
there
over
the
planet
s
surface
nor
was
this
all
instead
of
the
thoth
another
canal
showed
straight
down
the
disk
from
the
syrtis
minor
to
the
aquae
calidae
this
canal
was
as
unmistakable
as
the
thoth
had
been
before
to
schiaparelli
it
was
among
the
first
to
be
detected
and
continued
no
less
conspicuous
to
the
end
the
dates
at
which
it
was
seen
being
july
august
and
october
i
called
it
the
amenthes
identifying
it
with
the
canal
so
named
in
schiaparelli
s
chart
published
in
und
of
the
of
his
observations
from
to
but
in
his
memoirs
he
never
called
it
so
seeing
it
indeed
only
in
and
deeming
it
then
the
thoth
nevertheless
in
it
was
the
conspicuous
canal
of
the
region
and
what
is
more
had
come
as
it
proved
to
stay
the
invisibility
of
the
thoth
continued
for
me
the
same
during
the
succeeding
oppositions
of
and
at
the
former
opposition
i
drew
it
in
on
july
august
september
october
seeing
it
single
and
in
on
january
february
and
march
it
was
single
but
with
suspicions
of
doubling
in
january
and
was
indubitably
double
in
february
as
for
the
thoth
i
had
come
to
consider
it
and
the
amenthes
one
attributing
their
diversity
of
depiction
to
errors
in
drawing
for
while
the
thoth
remained
obstinately
invisible
the
amenthes
presented
itself
as
substitute
so
insistently
as
to
make
one
of
the
most
obvious
canals
upon
the
disk
one
exception
only
was
there
to
this
state
of
things
on
june
my
notes
contain
this
adumbration
of
a
something
else
amenthes
sometimes
appeared
with
a
turn
to
it
way
up
two
canals
concave
to
the
syrtis
illustration
amenthes
alone
in
february
so
matters
opened
at
the
opposition
of
with
the
advent
of
the
planet
and
the
presentation
in
due
course
of
libya
in
february
the
amenthes
duly
appeared
much
as
it
had
showed
at
the
opposition
before
only
less
salient
it
was
a
confused
and
seemingly
narrower
double
suspected
on
the
of
that
month
it
was
definitely
seen
from
the
to
the
of
the
thoth
no
mention
is
made
either
in
the
notes
or
in
the
drawings
when
the
region
came
round
again
in
march
the
amenthes
was
still
there
showing
more
feebly
however
than
it
had
in
february
in
spite
of
better
seeing
and
the
fact
that
the
planet
had
considerably
neared
clearly
the
canal
was
fading
out
a
fact
further
witnessed
to
by
the
following
note
made
on
march
throughout
this
opposition
thus
far
the
dark
triangle
tipped
by
aquae
calidae
has
been
sharply
divided
in
intensity
from
the
amenthes
which
is
very
narrow
and
exceedingly
still
was
there
no
trace
of
the
thoth
illustration
amenthes
feebler
and
still
alone
in
march
with
the
april
presentation
entered
a
new
order
of
things
when
the
region
first
became
visible
on
the
the
amenthes
could
still
be
seen
and
alone
but
on
the
as
the
relative
falling
back
of
the
martian
longitudes
swung
the
region
nearer
the
centre
of
the
disk
the
thoth
appeared
alongside
of
it
on
the
the
thoth
showed
alone
unmistakable
it
was
and
just
as
schiaparelli
had
drawn
it
accompanied
by
the
triton
and
the
curved
nepenthes
the
thing
was
a
revelation
what
before
i
had
seen
only
in
the
spirit
of
another
s
drawings
stood
there
patent
to
me
in
the
body
of
my
own
while
the
amenthes
to
which
i
had
so
long
been
accustomed
had
vanished
into
thin
air
only
a
trace
of
it
was
now
and
then
to
be
made
out
so
startlingly
strange
was
the
metamorphosis
that
i
could
not
at
first
trust
my
eyes
and
questioned
the
broken
line
which
had
replaced
the
straight
for
some
ocular
deception
but
nothing
i
could
do
would
rectify
it
the
amenthes
was
gone
and
the
thoth
stood
in
its
stead
illustration
appearance
of
thoth
with
triton
and
curved
nepenthes
amenthes
vanished
april
at
the
next
presentation
may
to
june
the
phenomena
were
repeated
and
with
increasing
clarity
and
then
of
a
sudden
on
may
i
saw
the
lucus
moeris
there
it
was
indubitably
and
its
definiteness
was
the
most
astonishing
part
of
the
affair
it
was
no
question
of
difficult
detection
indeed
i
had
not
been
on
the
lookout
for
it
having
searched
the
region
too
often
fruitlessly
before
to
have
left
incentive
to
search
again
and
so
when
i
was
not
searching
the
thing
of
its
own
accord
stepped
forth
to
sight
it
was
a
small
round
dot
like
to
any
other
oasis
and
showed
as
it
were
a
black
pearl
pendent
by
the
nepenthes
from
the
syrtis
s
ear
for
the
libyan
bay
made
a
dark
projection
of
the
sort
high
up
on
the
syrtis
s
eastern
side
from
which
the
nepenthes
precisely
as
schiaparelli
had
drawn
it
curved
down
to
the
point
where
the
thoth
and
triton
met
all
three
canals
were
geminated
the
gemination
being
about
three
degrees
wide
illustration
advent
of
the
lucus
moeris
may
and
now
occurred
the
last
act
in
the
drama
in
july
the
amenthes
reappeared
showing
alongside
of
the
and
thus
removing
any
possible
doubt
as
to
their
separate
identity
it
had
indeed
become
the
stronger
of
the
two
having
gained
in
strength
in
the
interval
between
june
and
july
and
the
having
lost
the
lines
were
in
process
of
relapsing
into
the
quo
had
these
three
presentations
not
been
watched
the
brief
apparition
of
the
had
been
missed
and
with
it
the
revealing
of
its
curious
character
and
of
certain
deductions
thereupon
illustration
amenthes
with
july
first
among
these
is
a
truth
of
which
i
have
long
been
convinced
to
wit
that
when
a
seeming
discordance
arises
between
the
portrayals
of
a
canal
it
is
commonly
not
a
case
of
mistake
nor
of
change
but
one
of
separate
identity
the
canal
has
not
shifted
its
place
nor
has
an
error
been
committed
the
fact
is
that
one
canal
has
been
observed
at
one
time
another
at
another
so
it
was
here
and
thus
were
the
old
and
the
new
observations
reconciled
there
had
been
no
mistake
in
either
two
separate
canals
accounted
for
the
discrepancy
and
only
an
unfounded
distrust
of
the
accuracy
possible
in
such
observations
was
to
blame
for
any
failure
to
recognize
the
fact
now
scrutiny
of
the
notes
upon
the
appearance
of
the
two
canals
together
with
their
labeling
by
the
seasonal
longitudes
of
the
planet
at
the
dates
they
were
made
discloses
a
curious
relation
between
the
two
the
seasonal
longitudes
are
important
as
they
date
the
phenomena
according
to
the
martian
calendar
ordered
thus
the
successive
aspects
reveal
first
a
seasonal
change
in
each
canal
and
then
over
and
above
this
a
secular
one
and
this
secular
change
was
such
as
to
cause
the
two
canals
to
alternate
in
visibility
when
the
one
was
present
the
other
was
not
and
illustration
cartouches
or
curves
of
visibility
of
amenthes
thoth
and
their
combination
we
shall
see
this
more
clearly
and
at
the
same
time
bring
out
a
curious
relation
between
the
two
systems
the
broken
bow
of
the
and
the
straight
arrow
of
the
amenthes
while
looking
at
the
cartouches
of
the
thoth
the
amenthes
and
a
combination
of
both
given
in
the
plate
on
previous
page
the
antithetical
character
of
the
two
canals
is
apparent
but
what
is
further
interesting
the
combination
cartouche
of
both
bears
a
singular
resemblance
to
that
of
the
mean
canal
of
the
north
tropic
zone
the
zone
to
which
both
canals
belong
here
then
is
a
combination
which
is
perfectly
regular
while
each
of
its
constituents
is
anomalous
and
now
we
come
to
something
as
important
at
the
opposition
of
the
curious
alternation
metamorphosis
was
enacted
anew
the
amenthes
appeared
disappeared
to
be
replaced
by
the
thoth
and
then
reappeared
again
beside
the
other
this
corroboration
of
behavior
showed
the
previous
observations
to
have
been
due
to
no
mistake
and
only
served
to
deepen
the
interest
in
this
last
and
more
singular
phase
of
canal
conduct
chapter
xxvi
arctic
canals
and
polar
rifts
last
in
time
but
not
least
in
importance
of
the
details
of
canal
development
to
be
detected
is
one
that
connects
these
strange
features
directly
with
the
melting
of
the
polar
caps
the
cartouches
showed
that
such
connection
was
to
be
inferred
the
facts
now
to
be
recorded
depict
it
by
an
identity
of
place
between
certain
phenomena
of
the
two
subjects
following
one
another
in
order
of
time
on
january
while
scanning
the
planet
i
was
suddenly
ware
of
a
rift
in
the
north
polar
cap
it
ran
a
little
to
the
west
of
south
from
where
it
started
in
at
the
cap
s
edge
and
went
clean
through
to
the
limb
the
pole
being
then
slightly
tilted
away
from
us
at
the
time
it
seemed
to
be
the
first
rift
ever
seen
in
that
cap
but
on
opening
a
little
later
schiaparelli
s
which
had
just
arrived
the
first
thing
my
eye
fell
on
was
a
drawing
of
a
rift
in
the
north
polar
cap
observed
by
him
when
the
planet
had
held
the
like
attitude
toward
the
earth
thirteen
years
before
reference
to
its
longitude
showed
it
to
be
the
identical
rift
seen
again
after
all
these
years
and
the
only
one
so
far
seen
in
the
northern
cap
at
the
next
opposition
more
rifts
were
detected
one
in
especial
on
december
running
from
arethusa
lucus
then
upon
the
edge
of
the
cap
athwart
the
snow
in
a
northwesterly
direction
in
the
forepart
of
the
opposition
of
which
in
its
martian
season
corresponded
to
that
in
when
the
rift
had
been
observed
many
rifts
were
detected
in
the
cap
and
among
them
one
traversing
the
cap
in
longitude
so
far
the
season
when
the
cap
had
been
observed
was
that
when
the
rifts
were
in
process
of
forming
the
ground
they
and
the
covered
had
not
yet
at
any
opposition
been
uncovered
it
was
only
when
my
observations
began
in
the
latter
half
of
the
opposition
of
that
the
season
on
mars
having
so
far
advanced
all
snow
in
those
latitudes
had
melted
then
appeared
however
the
canal
hippalus
an
arctic
canal
of
some
importance
lying
on
that
part
of
the
planet
previously
occupied
by
the
polar
cap
when
later
studying
the
observations
on
the
rifts
i
remembered
this
canal
and
turning
to
the
drawing
made
some
months
before
to
compare
the
two
critically
discovered
that
the
canal
occupied
the
precise
position
held
earlier
by
the
rift
one
had
said
the
rift
had
never
vanished
but
that
the
white
surrounding
it
had
simply
turned
to
ochre
here
then
was
a
striking
coincidence
of
place
too
exact
to
be
the
result
of
chance
impressed
by
the
identity
i
examined
all
the
other
rifts
seen
early
in
comparing
them
with
the
arctic
canals
seen
later
to
the
finding
of
no
less
than
five
cases
of
the
same
coinciding
positions
the
importance
of
the
identification
here
made
of
an
arctic
canal
with
a
previous
rift
in
the
polar
cap
has
led
me
to
make
a
list
of
the
canals
thus
identified
at
this
opposition
visible
as
a
rift
visible
as
a
canal

to
if
it
be
asked
why
these
canals
do
not
appear
recorded
at
the
march
presentation
as
either
the
one
phenomenon
or
the
other
the
answer
is
twofold
first
because
they
showed
as
shadings
lost
amidst
a
shaded
mass
and
secondly
the
observations
at
several
oppositions
indicate
a
great
amount
of
haze
over
the
region
at
that
season
of
the
martian
year
we
may
now
go
back
to
the
very
first
rift
that
of
the
martian
season
grew
later
with
each
succeeding
opposition
and
it
so
chanced
abetted
by
this
fact
that
the
delaying
snow
was
never
seen
covering
that
part
of
the
planet
again
and
so
of
course
not
the
rift
the
martian
summer
in
those
high
latitudes
came
on
and
with
it
brought
the
great
arctic
canal
the
jaxartes
into
conspicuousness
the
canal
in
consequence
had
been
observed
for
some
time
before
it
proclaimed
itself
the
apotheosis
of
a
rift
and
that
of
the
first
and
most
important
rift
of
all
comparison
of
position
however
entirely
confirmed
the
conjecture
and
added
another
and
the
most
striking
of
all
to
the
list
these
six
canals
on
the
whole
the
largest
which
run
into
the
northern
cap
have
thus
a
dual
character
starting
originally
as
rifts
they
later
come
out
unmistakably
as
canals
so
that
we
may
say
in
general
that
the
two
phenomena
are
different
seasonal
states
of
the
same
thing
this
instantly
explains
the
rifts
the
origin
of
which
we
found
of
so
difficult
not
to
say
impossible
interpretation
before
in
these
pages
and
incidentally
it
confirms
what
we
deduced
on
other
grounds
as
the
character
of
the
canals
to
wit
strips
of
vegetation
for
if
the
cap
covered
desert
and
fertility
alike
it
is

vegetation

the
property
of
melting

the
metabolism
of
the

like
that
of
the
animal
though
in
a
less
degree
generates
caloric
a
living
animal
is
warm
even
the
ones
in
some
sort
and
a
growing
plant
is
too
the
chemic
processes
concerned
give
off
heat
though
in
such
small
quantities
that
we
are
often
not
aware
of
it
while
the
plant
lies
dormant
it
stays
cold
but
the
moment
its
sap
begins
to
run
under
the
rays
of
the
spring
sun
it
rises
in
temperature
above
its
winter
surroundings
all
it
needs
to
this
awakening
is
sun
and
water
and
both
it
gets
in
its
place
in
the
polar
cap
after
the
passing
of
the
vernal
equinox
the
time
therefore
is
suitable
for
it
is
not
till
after
that
equinox
is
passed
that
any
of
the
above
phenomena
occur
in
consequence
the
snow
about
it
melts
and
the
plants
themselves
show
as
dark
rifts
splitting
the
cap
this
quite
unexpected
identity
of
two
seemingly
diverse
phenomena
and
the
unsolicited
support
its
only
explanation
lends
to
the
general
theory
is
an
instance
of
what
is
constantly
occurring
as
observation
of
the
planet
is
pushed
farther
and
farther
facts
every
little
while

oases
kinematic
subject
to
change
also
are
the
oases
and
in
the
same
manner
apparently
as
the
canals
they
grow
less
evident
at
a
like
season
of
the
martian
year
they
do
this
seemingly
by
decreasing
in
size
whereas
in
the
full
expanse
of
their
maturity
they
show
as
round
spots
of
appreciable
diameter
as
the
season
wanes
they
contract
to
the
smallest
discernible
of
dots
all
but
the
kernel
as
it
were
fades
out
and
even
this
may
disappear
from
sight
the
phœnix
lake
in
its
summer
time
is
a
very
dark
circular
spot
small
indeed
yet
of
definite
extension
in
its
winter
it
shrinks
to
a
pin
point
and
is
often
not
visible
at
all
sometimes
the
husk
apparently
persists
a
ghostlike
reminiscence
of
what
it
was
with
the
kernel
showing
in
its
centre
thus
the
lucus
lunae
appeared
at
the
opposition
of
a
faint
wash
betokened
the
presence
of
the
lucus
through
which
now
and
again
a
black
pierced
in
this
visible
decrease
of
size
we
get
a
revelation
as
to
what
takes
place
impossible
in
the
case
of
the
canals
the
tenuous
character
of
which
precludes
more
than
inference
as
to
the
process
like
the
canals
latitude
together
with
the
suitable
season
of
the
planet
s
year
are
the
determining
factors
in
their
development
in
what
corresponded
to
our
july
of
the
northern
hemisphere
the
oases
in
the
and
north
temperate
zones
were
conspicuous
black
spots
that
showed
in
profusion
along
the
parallels
of
and
north
at
the
same
time
the
equatorial
ones
those
along
the
which
had
been
most
evident
in
hardly
came
out
it
had
been
their
time
then
as
it
was
that
of
the
others
now
the
law
of
development
is
not
so
simple
as
on
the
earth
depending
like
that
of
the
canals
not
only
upon
the
return
of
the
sun
but
upon
the
advent
of
the
water
let
loose
from
about
the
polar
caps
thus
the
equatorial
oases
are
subject
to
two
seasonal
quickenings
one
from
the
north
the
other
from
the
south
in
regard
to
their
method
of
evolution
or
devolution
a
most
curious
observation
happened
to
me
in
usually
the
oases
are
of
solid
tone
throughout
equally
sombre
from
centre
to
circumference
but
in
this
case
such
uniform
complexion
found
exception
on
march
the
ascraeus
lucus
came
out
strangely
differentiated
a
dark
rim
inclosing
a
less
dark
kernel
the
sight
was
odd
enough
to
command
comment
in
the
shape
of
a
sketch
which
accompanied
the
note
and
the
further
remark
that
other
spots
had
similarly
that
year
affected
the
like
look
that
the
effect
was
optical
did
not
seem
to
me
the
case
other
spots
at
other
times
showed
nothing
of
the
sort
if
it
was
due
to
objective
cause
it
gathers
circumstance
from
what
was
then
the
martian
time
of
year
for
the
season
was
such
that
the
spot
should
then
have
been
in
process
of
waning
and
the
effect
would
indicate
that
in
so
doing
the
tone
of
the
centre
went
first
that
of
the
circumference
fading
last
this
would
be
in
accordance
with
a
growth
proceeding
outward
and
a
decay
that
followed
in
its
steps
when
to
this
we
add
the
look
of
the
oases
at
the
antithetic
season
a
faint
shading
only
with
or
without
a
darker
at
its
core
are
led
to
the
belief
that
the
area
of
the
oasis
is
unchangeable
and
that
its
growth
means
a
deepening
of
tint
so
far
then
as
it
is
possible
to
particularize
them
the
oases
develop
from
a
small
nucleus
perhaps
twenty
miles
in
diameter
perhaps
less
and
from
this
spread
radially
till
they
attain
a
width
of
or
one
hundred
miles
if
the
oasis
be
associated
with
a
double
canal
this
maximum
width
exactly
fits
the
space
between
the
twin
lines
even
when
no
double
enters
the
oasis
the
size
is
about
the
same
this
size
attained
they
hold
it
for
some
months
then
they
proceed
to
fade
out
to
their
initial
nucleus
and
after
a
sufficient
rest
the
process
starts
over
again
with
the
carets
something
of
the
same
sort
seems
to
take
we
may
consider
as
betokening
a
general
law
the
fact
that
in
the
carets
at
the
mouths
of
the
phison
and
euphrates
developed
before
their
affiliated
canals
but
about
them
much
less
is
yet
known
and
we
must
be
content
to
say
that
the
observations
of
made
at
the
opposite

of
the

seem
to

as

it
now
becomes
obligatory
by
marshaling
the
facts
to

to
seek
to
find
out
what
they

now
so
soon
as
we

for

we
perceive
one
characteristic
of

which
at
once
appears
to
direct
us
to
their
nature
and
justifies
itself
as
a
signpost
with
increasing
certainty
as
we
read
on
this
trait
is
the
very
simple
yet
most
significant
one
of
showing
intrinsic
change
the
lines
alter
in
visibility
with
time
this
primary
proclivity
we
do
not
even
need
the

to
establish
that
the

is
palpable

any

schiaparelli
was
struck
by
the
fact
early
in
his
study
of
the
planet
and
it
forces
itself
on
the
notice
of
any
careful
observer
who
compares
his
own
observations
with
one
another
at
intervals
but
though
the
cartouches
are
not
needed
to
a
first
revelation
of
mutability
they
serve
to
certify
and
precise
it
to
much
further
information
on
the
subject
for
that
these
changes
are
not
extrinsic
that
is
are
not
caused
by
varying
definition
distance
or
illumination
they
make
patent
even
to
those
who
have
never
seen
the
things
themselves
by
disclosing
respective
differences
of
behavior
in
lines
similarly
circumstanced
optically
the
change
is
therefore
intrinsic
and
the
question
arises
to
what
can
such
intrinsic
change
be
due
in
searching
for
cause
attention
is
at
once
attracted
by
another
series
of
transmutations
that
manifests
itself
upon
the
disk
in
the
orderly
melting
of
the
polar
caps
for
the
existence
of
the
two
sets
of
metamorphoses
suggests
the
possibility
of
a
connection
between
them
the
inference
is
strengthened
when
we
note
that
not
only
are
both
periodic
but
that
furthermore
the
period
of
the
two
is
the
same
each
polar
cap
runs
through
its
gamut
of
change
in
a
martian
year
the
canals
also
complete
their
cycle
of
growth
and
decay
in
a
martian
twelvemonth
the
only
difference
between
the
two
is
that
each
polar
cap
has
but
one
maximum
and
one
minimum
in
the
course
of
this
time
while
most
of
the
canals
have
two
of
each
though
the
maxima
are
not
alike
nor
the
minima
either
not
only
is
the
period
of
the
two
series
of
changes
the
same
but
the
one
follows
the
other
for
the
development
of
the
canals
does
not
begin
till
the
melting
of
the
polar
cap
is
well
under
way
now
as
the
polar
cap
disintegrates
it
gives
rise
as
we
have
seen
to
a
dark
belt
of
which
fringes
its
outer
edge
and
retreats
with
it
as
it
shrinks
this
tells
directly
or
indirectly
of
a
product
let
loose
after
this
belt
has
been
formed
the
canals
nearest
to
it
proceed
to
darken
then
those
a
little
farther
off
follow
suit
and
so
the
wave
of
visibility
rolls
in
regular
routine
down
the
disk
here
then
at
the
outset
we
have
a
chronic
connection
between
the
two
phenomena
the
disintegration
of
the
cap
and
the
integration
of
the
canals
of
water
we
saw
that
the
caps
were
undoubtedly
composed
and
to
water
then
let
loose
by
the
melting
of
the
cap
we
may
inferably
ascribe
the
thaumaturgy
in
the
development
of
the
canals
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
suppose
that
this
is
done
directly
that
the
increased
visibility
of
the
canals
can
be
due
to
a
bodily
transference
of
water
seems
doubtful
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
delay
in
the
action
considerable
time
intervenes
between
the
disappearance
of
the
cap
and
the
appearance
of
the
canals
except
in
the
case
of
such
as
have
been
covered
by
it
transformation
consequent
upon
transference
however
would
account
for
hesitancy
a
quickening
to
vegetal
growth
would
produce
the
counterpart
of
what
we
see
if
set
free
from
the
winter
locking
up
the
water
accumulated
in
the
cap
then
percolated
equatorward
starting
vegetation
in
its
course
this
would
cause
the
increased
visibility
of
the
canals
and
at
the
same
time
explain
the
seeming
delay
by
allowing
for
the
time
necessary
for
this
vegetation
to
sprout
this
is
certainly
the
most
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
phenomena
thus
started
the
vegetal
quickening
would
pass
down
the
planet
s
surface
and
give
rise
to
what
we
mark
as
seasonal
change
but
though
in
one
sense
of
seasonal
character
a
little
consideration
will
show
that
it
would
be
quite
unlike
the
seasonal
change
which
we
know
on
earth
could
we
see
our
earth
from
some
standpoint
in
space
we
should
mark
with
the
advent
of
spring
a
wave
of
verdure
sweep
over
its
face
if
freedom
from
cloud
permitted
of
an
unimpeded
view
this
flush
of
waking
from
winter
s
sleep
would
be
quite
evident
and
could
be
seen
to
spread
starting
from
the
equator
so
soon
as
the
sun
turned
north
it
too
would
travel
northward
and
distancing
the
sun
arrive
by
midsummer
well
into
the
arctic
zone
here
then
we
should
note
much
as
we
note
it
on
mars
a
tint
of
superpose
itself
successively
upon
the
ochre
ground
but
the
mundane
and
the
martian
vegetal
awakening
would
differ
in
one
fundamental
respect
the
earthly
wave
would
be
seen
to
travel
from
equator
to
pole
while
the
arian
travels
from
pole
to
equator
though
clearly
seasonal
in
character
both
of
them
the
transformations
would
be
opposite
in
action
some
other
cause
then
must
be
at
work
from
what
we
are
familiar
with
on
earth
this
other
cause
is
the
presence
or
absence
of
moisture
two
factors
are
necessary
to
the
begetting
of
vegetal
life
the
raw
material
and
the
reacting
agent
oxygen
nitrogen
water
and
a
few
salts
make
up
the
first
desideratum
the
sun
supplies
the
second
unless
both
be
present
the
quickening
to
life
never
comes
now
the
one
may
be
there
and
the
other
not
or
the
other
there
and
the
one
not
on
earth
the
material
including
water
is
except
in
certain
destitute
localities
always
present
the
sun
it
is
that
periodically
withdraws
observant
upon
the
return
of
the
sun
is
therefore
the
annual
recurrence
of
vegetal
growth
on
mars
on
the
contrary
water
is
lacking
this
we
now
know
conclusively
from
other
phenomena
the
disk
presents
which
have
no
connection
with
the
present
investigation
and
are
therefore
unprejudiced
witnesses
to
the
fact
no
permanent
bodies
of
water
stud
its
surface
that
the
seas
are
traversed
by
dark
lines
permanent
in
place
is
one
of
several
proofs
of
this
the
only
surface
water
the
planet
knows
comes
from
the
melting
of
its
polar
caps
vegetation
can
not
start
until
this
water
reaches
it
consequently
though
the
sun
be
ready
vegetation
must
wait
upon
the
coming
of
the
water
and
starting
from
near
the
pole
follow

to

not

up

the
latter
down

for
better
understanding
the
two
curves
of
phenological
quickening
the
mundane
and
the
martian
are
shown
in
the
diagrams
the

represent
the
surfaces
of
the
two
planets
that
of

being
shown
upside

at

so
as
to
agree
with
the
telescopic
depiction
of
the
topography
of

the
stars
mark
the
epoch
of
the
of
vegetation
at
successive
latitudes
the
time
increasing
toward
the
right
the
curves
it
will
be
noticed
are
bowed
in
opposite
ways
the
bowed
effect
is
due
in
part
to
mercator
s
projection
in
part
it
may
represent
a
real
decrease
in
speed
with
time
but
what
is
strikingly
noticeable
is
the
opposite
character
of
the
advance
to
the
right
the
one
curve
running
up
the
disk
the
other
down
it
this
shows
that
the
development
of
vegetation
proceeded
in
opposite
directions
over
the
surface
thus
is
the
opposed
action
upon
the
two
planets
accounted
for
and
we
are
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
canals
are
strips
of
vegetation
fed
by
water
from
the
polar
caps
and
that
the
floral
seasons
there
as
affecting
the
canals
are
conditioned
not
as
they
would
be
with
us
directly
upon
the
return
of
the
sun
but
indirectly
so
through
its
direct
effect
upon
the
polar
snows
once
adventured
on
the
idea
of
vegetation
we
find
that
it
explains
much
more
than
the
time
taken
by
the
wave
of
down
the
disk
it
accounts
at
once
for
the
behavior
of
the
canals
in
the
three
northern
zones
the
polar
arctic
and
the
mean
cartouches
of
these
three
zones
dip
down
at
their
latter
end
instead
of
rising
there
as
is
the
case
with
the
cartouches
of
the
mean
canals
farther
south
this
dip
denotes
that
the
most
northern
canals
were
waning
already
by
the
middle
of
their
august
though
the
others
showed
no
such
tendency
while
the
date
of
the
deposition
of
the
frost
in
these
northern
latitudes
shows
that
they
were
started
upon
their
course
toward
extinction
before
the
snow
itself
had
covered
them
in
other
words
they
were
not
obliterated
but
snuffed
out
that
their
decline
was
thus
preparatory
to
the
coming
of
the
first
snowfall
or
sufficiently
severe
to
whiten
the
ground
so
that
it
did
not
melt
the
next
day
is
suggestive
of
their
constitution
it
is
clear
that
they
were
not
abruptly
cut
off
by
the
frost
but
were
timed
by
nature
to
such
extinction
vegetation
would
behave
in
just
this
way
since
evolution
would
accommodate
the
career
of
a
plant
to
its
environment
the
first
question
to
present
itself
chronologically
in
the
canals
annual
history
is
connected
with
the
size
of
the
cap
unfortunately
for
the
simplicity
of
the
phenomena
the
cap
is
not
an
extensionless
source
of
flow
but
an
extended
surface
melting
from
the
outer
edge
in
it
would
seem
therefore
that
water
liberated
from
the
outer
parts
should
have
an
effect
before
the
main
body
of
it
were
ready
to
begin
its
general
march
down
the
disk
there
should
be
one
would
think
at
least
a
partial
action
locally
before
the
main
action
got
under
way
now
there
are
certain
canals
that
show
cartouches
increasing
apparently
from
the
time
observations
began
and
the
most
pronounced
is
the
jaxartes
which
lies
of
all
the
canals
observed
the
farthest
north
now
the
cartouches
were
founded
on
canals
quickened
from
the
north
polar
cap
the
farther
north
the
canal
therefore
the
greater
the
likelihood
of
its
showing
the
phenomena
that
we
note
such
canals
is
therefore
not
only
not
subversive
but
actually
corroboratory
of
the
law
it
seems
at
first
to
shake
that
all
the
canals
of
these
zones
do
not
show
a
like
is
not
necessary
a
part
of
them
being
dependent
not
upon
the
earlier
but
upon
the
later
liberated
flow
and
thus
partaking
in
the
general
law
which
grows
uniform
lower
down
the
latitudes
as
the
action
from
one
polar
cap
proceeds
not
only
down
to
the
equator
but
across
it
into
the
planet
s
other
hemisphere
it
appears
that
much
at
least
of
the
surface
of
mars
has
two
seasons
of
vegetal
growth
the
one
quickened
of
the
north
polar
cap
the
other
of
the
southern
how
far
the
polar
spheres
of
action
overlap
it
is
not
possible
at
present
to
affirm
as
the
canals
at
this
opposition
were
only
visible
to
south
latitude
that
the
north
polar
quickening
goes
down
so
far
is
vouched
for
and
it
is
probable
from
other
observed
phenomena
that
it
goes
farther
the
alternate
quickening
also
discloses
itself
directly
in
the
cartouches
the
previous
semestral
growth
from
the
south
polar
cap
actually
showing
in
them
before
the
impulse
from
the
north
began
the
slow
falling
of
their
curves
to
the
minimum
preceding
their
later
rise
is
nothing
less
than
the
dying
out
of
the
effect
started
six
months
before
from
the
south
the
gentler
gradient
of
their
fall
proclaims
a
gradual
lapse
just
as
the
subsequent
sharper
rise
points
to
the
advent
of
a
fresh
impulse
and
this
deduction
seems
to
be
borne
out
by
another
circumstance
there
is
some
evidence
of
decrease
in
the
gradient
southward
this
is
telling
testimony
to
the
source
whence
the
impulse
came
for
if
it
originated
at
the
south
and
traveled
northward
the
southern
canals
would
be
the
first
to
be
affected
and
the
first
to
die
out
and
thus
show
a
longer
dead
season
exhibited
in
the
cartouches
as
a
more
level
stretch
lastly
the
explanation
of
the
canals
as
threads
of
vegetation
fays
in
with
the
one
which
has
been
found
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
areas
while
the
fact
that
they
prove
to
develop
as
they
do
reversely
to
what
would
take
place
on
earth
is
exactly
what
all
we
have
latterly
learnt
about
the
surface
conditions
of
the
planet
would
lead
us
to
expect
from
what
has
just
been
said
we
see
that
the
latest
observations
at
flagstaff
confirm
the
earlier
ones
and
what
is
especially
corroborative
they
do
so
along
another
line
the
former
were
chiefly
static
the
latter
kinematic
in
other
words
the
behavior
of
the
canals
in
action
bears
out
the
testimony
of
their
appearance
at
rest

life
study
of
the
fundamental
features
of
martian
topography
has
disclosed
as
we
have
seen
the
existence
of
vegetation
on
the
planet
as
the
only
rational
explanation
of
the
dark
markings
there
considered
not
simply
on
the
score
of
their
appearance
momentarily
but
judged
by
the
changes
that
appearance
undergoes
at
successive
seasons
of
the
martian
year
thus
we
are
assured
that
plant
life
exists
on
the
planet
we
are
made
aware
of
the
fact
in
more
ways
than
one
but
most
unanswerably
for
that
trait
to
which
vegetation
owes
its
very
name
periodic
quickening
to
life
thus
the
characteristic
which
has
seemed
here
most
distinctive
of
this
phase
of
the
organic
so
that
man
even
christened
it
in
accordance
has
proved
equally
telltale
there
important
as
a
conclusion
this
is
no
less
pregnant
as
a
premise
for
the
assurance
that
plant
life
exists
on
mars
leads
to
a
further
step
in
extramundane
acquaintance
of
import
it
introduces
us
at
once
to
the
probability
of
life
there
of
a
higher
and
more
immediately
appealing
kind
not
with
the
vagueness
of
general
analogy
but
with
the
definiteness
of
specific
deduction
for
the
presence
of
a
flora
is
itself
ground
for
suspecting
a
fauna
of
a
bond
connecting
the
two
we
get
our
first
hint
the
moment
we
look
inquiringly
into
the
world
about
us
that
of
our
own
earth
common
experience
witnesses
to
a
coexistence
which
grows
curious
and
compelling
as
we
consider
it
for
it
is
not
confined
to
life
of
any
special
order
but
extends
through
the
whole
range
of
organisms
of
both
kinds
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
algæ
and
monera
orchid
and
mammal
occur
side
by
side
and
with
a
certain
considerate
poverty
or
richness
as
the
case
may
be
luxuriance
in
the
one
is
matched
by
abundance
in
the
other
while
a
scanty
flora
means
a
poor
fauna
this
of
which
we
have
been
aware
in
regions
round
about
us
from
childhood
grows
in
universality
as
we
explore
wherever
man
penetrates
out
of
his
proper
sphere
he
finds
the
same
dual
possession
of
the
land
or
the
sea
and
a
similar
curtailing
or
expanding
of
both
tenantries
together
no
mountain

so
cold
but
that
if
it
grow
plants
it
supports
insects
and
animals
too
after
its
kind
no
desert
so
arid
but
that
creeping

find
it

now
from
the

to
its
factors
we
perceive
reasons
for
this
tenure
in

of
the
land
by
the
vegetal
and
animal
kingdoms
examination
proves
the
two
great
divisions
of
the
organic
to
be
inextricably
connected
it
strikes
our
notice
first
in
the
relation
of
plants
to
animals
it
is
of
everyday
notoriety
that
animals
eat
plants
though
it
is
less
universally
understood
that
in
the
ultimate
they
exist
on
nothing
else
plants
furnish
the
food
of
animals
not
as
a
matter
of
partial
preference
but
of
fundamental
necessity
for
the
plant
is
the
indispensable
intermediary
in
the
process
of
metabolism
without
plants
animals
would
soon
cease
to
exist
since
they
are
unable
to
manufacture
their
own
plasm
out
of
the
raw
material
offered
by
inorganic
nature
they
must
make
it
out
of
the
already
prepared
plasm
of
plants
or
out
of
other
animals
who
have
made
it
from
plants
so
that
in
the
end
it
all
comes
back
to
plant
production
the
plant
is
able
to
build
its
plasm
out
of
chemical
substances
the
animal
can
not
except
in
the
case
of
the
begin
thus
at
the
lowest
rung
of
the
alimentary
ladder
but
the
converse
of
this
dependence
is
also
largely
true
plants
are
beholden
to
animals
for
processes
that
in
return
make
their
own
life
possible
the
latter
minister
to
the
former
with
unconscious
service
all
the
time
and
with
no
more
arrogant
independence
than
do
our
domestics
generally
nowadays
the
inconspicuous
earthworm
is
the
fieldhand
of
nature
s
crops
who
gets
his
own
living
by
making
theirs
without
this
day
and
night
laborer
the
soil
for
want
of
stirring
had
remained
less
capable
of
grass
above
ground
it
is
the
same
story
deprived
of
the
ministrations
of
insects
many
kinds
of
plants
would
incontinently
perish
by
the
solicited
visits
of
bees
and
other
generically
may
be
classed
by
the
layman
as
the
plant
s
propagation
made
possible
peculiarly
well
named
indeed
are
the
hymenoptera
seeing
that
they
are
the
great
matrimonial
carrying
pollen
from
one
individual
to
another
and
thus
uniting
what
otherwise
could
not
meet
spectacular
as
this
widespread
commerce
is
it
forms
but
portion
of
the
daily
drama
in
which
animals
and
plants
alike
take
part
from
forthright
bargainings
of
honey
for
help
we
pass
to
less
direct
but
no
less
effective
alliance
where
plants
are
beholden
to
animals
for
life
by
the
killing
of
their
enemies
or
the
of
their
competitors
and
from
this
to
generic
furtherance
where
the
interdependence
becomes
broadcast
in
the
matter
of
metabolism
the
advantage
is
not
all
upon
one
side
in
the
katabolic
process
of
that
which
each
discards
are
the
two
classes
of
life
mutually
complimentary
waste
of
the
one
being
the
want
of
the
other
acid
gas
being
given
off
by
the
animal
oxygen
by
the
plant
in
biologic
economy
it
is
daily
more
demonstrable
that
both
are
necessary
constituents
to
an
advancing
whole
and
that
each
pays
for
what
it
gets
by
what
it
gives
in
return
that
they
are
thus
ancillary
as
well
as
coexistent
today
leads
us
to
confront
for
them
a
community
of
origin
in
the
past
and
further
study
confirms
the
inference
both
paleontology
and
entomology
or
the
science
of
the
aged
and
the
science
of
the
young
prove
such
ancestry
to
be
a
fact
by
going
back
from
the
present
into
the
past
or
what
amounts
to
substantially
the
same
thing
by
descending
in
the
scale
of
life
to
the
lowest
known
forms
of
organism
we
find
proof
of
concomitance
cogent
because
congenital
at
the
time
when
inorganic
chemical
compounds
first
passed
by
evolution
into
organic
ones
the
change
was
of
so
general
a
character
that
even
such
tardy
representatives
of
it
as
survive
today
tax
erudition
to
tell
to
which
of
the
two
great
kingdoms
they
belong
the
vegetal
or
the
animal
simplest
and
most
primitive
of
known
organisms
are
the
chromacea
unnucleated
single
cells
as
haeckel
has
shown
and
next
to
them
in
order
come
many
of
the
bacteria
also
of
simple
unnucleated
plasm
so
little
do
the
majority
of
the
bacteria
differ
morphologically
from
the
chromacea
that
on
the
score
of
structure
the
two
are
not
to
be
catalogued
apart
both
are
as
elemental
as
anything
well
can
be
which
only
their
diet
serves
to
divide
each
is
an
organism
without
organs
thus
belying
the
dictionary
definition
of
both
animals
and
plants
etymologically
they
are
not
organic
yet
manifestly
are
alive
and
only
in
their
action
are
unlike
the
chromacea
are
beings
and
therefore
they
are
plants
the
bacteria
are
beings
and
so
are
animals
even
this
distinction
is
not
always
preserved
as
haeckel
tells
us
the
which
dwell
in
the
earth
having
the
vegetal
property
of
converting
ammonia
by
oxidation
into
nitrous
acid
and
this
into
nitric
acid
using
as
their
source
of
carbon
the
carbonic
acid
gas
of
the
atmosphere
they
feed
like
the
chromacea
on
simple
inorganic
here
then
we
have
close
to
the
threshold
of
organic
life
unorganized
organisms
roughly
speaking
coeval
and
differing
in
a
sense
but
little
either
of
them
from
inorganic
crystals
and
yet
the
one
is
an
animal
the
other
a
plant
progenitors
of
the
two
great
divisions
of
life
they
were
themselves
concomitantly
evolved
either
side
by
side
or
as
offshoots
both
of
a
common
stock
now
if
the
ancestors
of
the
two
great
organic
kingdoms
were
thus
simultaneously
produced
here
we
are
warranted
in
believing
that
they
would
similarly
be
produced
elsewhere
given
conditions
suitably
alike
in
consequence
if
we
detect
the
presence
of
the
one
we
already
have
an
argument
for
inferring
the
other
not
to
complete
our
syllogism
would
be
to
flaunt
a
lack
of
logic
in
nature
s
face
rationally
viewed
then
the
general
problem
of
life
in
other
worlds
reduces
itself
to
a
question
of
conditions
since
certain
physical
results
follow
inevitably
upon
certain
physical
premises
if
we
can
assure
ourselves
of
the
proper
premises
we
may
look
to
nature
for
their
conclusion
then
the
possibility
of
life
becomes
one
of
habitat
if
the
environment
be
suitable
life
will
ensue
what
makes
for
such
a
mediary
is
like
most
cosmic
processes
in
its
fundamentals
of
interesting
simplicity
for
the
production
of
a
proper
nidus
depends
primarily
upon
the
mere
size
of
the
body
parentally
concerned
if
a
planet
be
big
enough
it
will
inevitably
bring
forth
life
because
of
conditions
suitable
to
its
generating
if
too
small
it
will
remain
sterile
to
the
end
of
time
that
size
should
be
the
determining
factor
whether
a
planet
shall
be
fecund
or
barren
may
seem
at
first
thought
strange
yet
that
it
is
so
admits
of
no
rational
doubt
all
that
we
see
of
bodies
about
us
shows
its
truth
and
what
we
have
learnt
of
cosmic
process
enables
us
in
some
sort
to
discern
why
in
order
for
evolution
such
as
we
mark
it
upon
the
earth
to
be
possible
the
parent
body
must
have
been
at
one
time
at
a
high
temperature
since
only
under
great
heat
can
the
primal
processes
occur
but
for
this
generation
of
caloric
the
aggregate
mass
of
the
particles
the
falling
together
of
which
makes
the
planet
and
their
stoppage
its
internal
heat
must
be
large
the
sun
s
rays
alone
are
insufficient
to
cause
the
necessary
temperature
the
heat
must
come
from
within
though
it
be
helped
from
without
even
here
the
action
is
abetted
by
a
large
body
for
a
planet
to
entrap
the
sun
s
rays
or
even
to
preserve
its
own
internal
warmth
an
atmosphere
is
needed
and
it
takes
a
large
body
to
retain
an
atmospheric
covering
sufficiently
long
yet
without
it
not
only
would
there
be
no
suitable
state
but
no
medium
in
which
organic
or
even
inorganic
reactions
could
go
on
lastly
water
the
essential
nidus
for
the
organism
s
early
stages
has
its
presence
similarly
conditioned
for
this
like
the
atmosphere
would
from
a
small
body
speedily
vanish
away
thus
the
planet
itself
is
the
body
although
the
sun
furthers
the
process
when
once
begun
that
the
needed
substances
are
planetarily
present
what
we
know
of
the
distribution
of
matter
astronomically
sufficiently
attests
what
we
find
in
meteorites
shows
that
the
catastrophe
which
preceded
our
present
solar
system
s
birth
scattered
its
elemental
constituents
throughout
its
domain
and
thus
when
they
came
to
be
gathered
up
again
into
planets
that
these
must
have
been
materially
the
same
the
manner
not
the
matter
then
is
alone
that
about
which
we
are
concerned
now
if
the
mass
of
matter
gravitating
together
to
form
a
planet
be
sufficient
to
produce
the
proper
inorganic
conditions
the
organic
must
follow
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
organic
springs
from
the
inorganic
is
not
only
shown
by
what
has
taken
place
on
earth
but
is
the
necessary
logical
deduction
from
its
decay
back
into
the
inorganic
again
as
nägeli
admirably
observes
the
origin
of
the
organic
from
the
inorganic
is
in
the
first
place
not
a
question
of
experience
and
experiment
but
a
fact
deduced
from
the
law
of
the
constancy
of
matter
and
force
if
all
things
in
the
material
world
are
causally
related
if
all
phenomena
proceed
on
natural
principles
organisms
which
are
formed
of
and
decay
into
the
same
matter
must
have
been
derived
originally
from
inorganic
the
original
oneness
of
the
two
the
fact
that
the
organic
sprang
from
the
inorganic
is
shown
by
the
cousinly
closeness
of
the
lowest
organic
with
the
highest
inorganic
substances
the
monera
are
suggestive
of
crystals
in
their
uniformity
of
structure
both
are
homogeneous
or
approximately
so
again
both
grow
by
taking
from
what
they
come
in
contact
with
that
which
they
find
suitable
and
so
add
to
their
body
by
homogeneous
accretion
finally
when
grown
too
large
for
single
life
they
part
into
similar
crystals
or
split
into
identical
cells
the
difference
between
the
division
of
the
crystal
and
the
fission
of
the
cell
is
small
in
kind
much
less
than
that
later
differentiation
in
genesis
into
parthenogenesis
and
sexual
reproduction
yet
here
we
unhesitatingly
trace
an
assured
relationship
it
were
straining
at
a
gnat
to
swallow
a
camel
to
doubt
it
in
the
other
just
as
the
two
behave
analogically
alike
in
their
own
action
so
do
they
observe
a
like
attitude
toward
nature
they
thus
point
to
their
common
origin
the
monera
are
resemblant
of
chemical
compounds
in
their
superiority
to
external
influences
to
outward
conditions
of
temperature
and
humidity
the
chromacea
are
much
as
sticks
and
stones
some
species
may
remain
for
long
frozen
in
ice
haeckel
observes
and
yet
wake
to
activity
so
soon
as
it
thaws
others
may
be
completely
desiccated
and
then
resume
their
life
when
put
in
water
after
a
lapse
of
several
years
thus
both
in
their
deathlike
lives
and
in
their
living
immortality
the
chromacea
are
close
to
inorganic
things
from
preference
however
these
lowest
forms
of
life
affect
what
to
us
would
be
unbearable
temperatures
many
of
the
chromacea
live
in
hot
springs
at
temperatures
of
to
fahrenheit
in
which
no
other
that
is
no
higher
organism
can
dwell
this
choice
of
habitat
is
in
line
with
the
other
details
of
their
evolutionary
career
for
it
too
is
in
keeping
with
the
conditions
of
crystalline
growth
halfway
as
it
were
on
the
road
to
them
the
forming
of
crystals
beginning
at
a
temperature
higher
still
and
we
perceive
from
it
that
the
passing
of
the
inorganic
into
the
organic
is
brought
about
by
a
lowering
of
the
temperature
of
the
parent
planet
this
again
is
in
line
with
the
evolution
of
chemical
complexity
let
the
heat
become
less
and
higher
and
higher
chemical
compounds
finally
the
organic
ones
become
possible
that
evolution
is
nothing
else
than
such
a
gradually
increasing
chemical
synthesis
is
forced
on
one
by
study
of
the
facts
once
started
life
as
paleontology
shows
develops
along
both
the
floral
and
the
faunal
lines
side
by
side
taking
on
complexity
with
time
it
begins
so
soon
as
secular
cooling
has
condensed
water
vapor
to
its
liquid
state
chromacea
and
confervæ
coming
into
being
high
up
toward
the
then
with
lowering
temperature
come
the
seaweeds
and
the
rhizopods
then
the
land
plants
and
the
lunged
vertebrates
hand
in
hand
the
fauna
and
flora
climb
to
more
intricate
perfecting
life
rising
as
temperature
lowers
we
perceive
then
that
considered
the
possibility
of
life
on
a
planet
is
merely
a
question
of
the
planet
s
size
and
then
pursuantly
that
the
character
of
that
life
is
a
matter
of
the
planet
s
age
but
age
again
is
a
question
of
size
for
the
smaller
its
mass
the
quicker
the
body
cools
and
with
a
planet
growing
cold
means
growing
old
within
the
bounds
that
make
life
possible
the
smaller
the
body
the
quicker
it
ages
and
the
more
advanced
its
denizens
must
be
just
how
far
the
advance
goes
we
may
not
assert
dogmatically
in
a
given
case
since
not
relative
age
alone
but
absolute
time
as
well
is
concerned
in
it
it
may
be
that
nature
s
processes
can
not
be
hurried
and
that
for
want
of
time
development
may
in
part
be
missed
but
from
general
considerations
the
limit
of
the
time
needed
seems
well
within
most
planetary
careers
now
the
aspect
of
the
surface
of
mars
shows
that
both
these
conditions
have
been
fulfilled
mars
is
large
enough
to
have
begotten
vegetation
and
small
enough
to
be
already
old
all
that
we
know
of
the
physical
state
of
the
planet
points
to
the
possibility
of
both
vegetal
and
animal
life
existing
there
and
furthermore
that
this
life
should
be
of
a
relatively
high
order
is
possible
nothing
contradicts
this
and
the
observations
of
the
last
ten
years
have
rendered
the
conclusion
then
advanced
only
the
more
conclusive
even
the
evidence
of
the
past
state
of
the
planet
confirms
that
given
by
its
present
one
that
with
us
life
came
out
of
the
seas
finds
its
possible
parallel
in
the
fact
that
seas
seem
once
to
have
existed
there
leaving
their
mark
discernible
life
then
had
there
as
here
the
wherewith
to
begin
that
we
find
air
and
water
in
both
shows
that
it
had
the
means
to
continue
once
begun
that
it
then
ran
a
like
course
is
further
witnessed
by
what
we
now
detect
the
necessary
premises
then
are
there
more
than
this
one
half
of
the
conclusion
vegetal
life
gives
evidence
of
itself

evidence
of
the
existence
of
animal
life
upon
a
far
planet
any
evidence
must
of
necessity
assume
a
different
guise
from
what
its
flora
would
present
plant
life
should
be
as
on
mars
we
perceive
it
is
recognizable
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
main
features
of
the
planet
s
face
in
no
such
forthright
manner
could
we
expect
an
animal
revelation
the
sort
of
testimony
which
would
render
the
one
patent
would
leave
the
other
obstinately
hid
so
long
as
animate
life
was
in
the
lowest
sense
animal
it
would
not
be
seen
at
all
though
it
were
as
widespread
as
the
vegetal
life
all
about
it
reason
for
this
lies
in
their
receptive
character
plants
are
fixtures
where
they
start
they
stay
while
from
the
nature
of
their
food
derived
directly
from
the
soil
and
from
the
air
and
conditioned
chiefly
by
warmth
and
moisture
like
forms
inhabit
large
areas
and
by
their
massed
effect
make
far
impression
with
animals
it
is
otherwise
they
feed
by
forage
from
beetle
to
buffalo
roaming
the
land
for
sustenance
thus
both
for
paucity
of
number
and
from
not
abiding
in
one
stay
they
must
escape
notice
at
a
distance
such
that
as
individuals
they
fail
to
show
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
the
flora
usually
overtop
the
fauna
and
so
help
to
hide
the
latter
while
appearing
itself
distinct
any
far
view
of
our
earth
gives
instance
of
this
seen
from
some
panoramic
height
forest
and
moorland
lie
patently
outspread
to
view
yet
imagination
is
taxed
to
believe
them
tenanted
at
all
unless
man
have
marred
the
landscape
not
a
sign
appears
of
any
living
thing
one
must
be
near
indeed
to
note
even
such
unusual
sights
as
a
herd
of
buffalo
in
the
plains
or
those
immense
flights
of
pigeons
that
in
former
years
occurred
like
clouds
darkening
the
air
from
the
standpoint
of
another
planet
through
any
such
direct
showing
animal
existence
would
still
remain
unknown
not
until
the
creatures
had
reached
a
certain
phase
in
evolution
would
their
presence
become
perceptible
and
not
then
directly
but
by
the
results
such
presence
brought
to
pass
occupancy
would
be
first
evidenced
by
its
imprint
on
the
land
discernible
thus
initially
not
so
much
by
the
bodily
as
by
the
mind
s
eye
for
not
till
the
animal
had
learnt
to
dominate
nature
and
fashion
it
to
his
needs
and
ends
would
his
existence
betray
itself
by
the
transformation
he
wrought
in
the
landscape
would
he
be
known
it
is
thus
we
should
make
our
own
far
acquaintance
and
by
the
disarrangement
of
nature
first
have
inkling
of
man
that
it
is
thus
we
should
betray
ourselves
a
consideration
of
man
s
history
will
show
while
he
still
remained
of
savage
simplicity
a
mere
child
of
nature
he
might
come
and
go
unmarked
by
an
outsider
but
so
soon
as
he
started
in
to
possess
the
earth
his
handicraft
would
reveal
him
from
the
moment
he
bethought
him
to
till
the
ground
he
entered
upon
a
course
of
of
which
we
can
not
foresee
the
end
but
he
has
already
advanced
far
enough
to
give
us
an
idea
of
the
process
it
began
with
agriculture
deforestation
with
its
subsequent
quartering
of
crops
signalized
his
acquisition
of
real
estate
his
impress
at
first
was
sporadic
and
irregular
and
in
so
far
followed
that
of
nature
itself
but
as
it
advanced
it
took
on
a
methodism
of
plan
husbandry
begot
thrift
and
augmented
wants
demanded
an
increasing
return
for
toil
and
to
this
desirable
end
systematization
became
a
necessity
at
the
same
time
gregariousness
grew
and
still
further
emphasized
the
need
for
economy
of
space
and
time
in
part
unconsciously
man
learnt
the
laws
that
govern
the
expenditure
of
force
and
more
and
more
consciously
applied
them
geometry
unloosed
of
euclid
became
a
part
of
everyday
life
as
insidiously
as
jourdain
found
that
he
had
been
talking
prose
regularity
rules
to
the
lament
of
art
the
railroad
is
straighter
than
the
turnpike
as
that
is
straighter
than
the

communication
is
now
too
urgent
in
its
demands
to
know
anything
but
law
and
take
other
than
the
shortest
path
to
its
destination
tillage
has
undergone
a
like
rectification
to
one
used
to
the
patchwork
quilting
of
the
crops
in
older
lands
the
methodical
rectangles
of
the
farms
of
the
great
west
are
painfully
exact
yet
it
is
more
than
probable
that
these
material
manifestations
would
be
the
first
signs
of
intelligence
to
one
considering
the
earth
from
far
our
towns
would
in
all
likelihood
constitute
the
next
and
lastly
the
great
arteries
of
travel
that
minister
to
their
wants
their
scale
too
would
render
them
the
first
objects
to
be
observed
farming
as
now
practiced
in
kansas
or
dakota
gives
it
a
certain
cosmical
concern
fields
for
miles
turning
in
hue
with
the
rhythm
of
the
drilled
should
impress
an
eye
if
armed
with
our
appliances
many
millions
of
miles
away
even
now
we
should
know
ourselves
cosmically
by
our
geometrical
designs
to
interplanetary
understanding
it
is
this
quality
that
would
speak
still
more
so
will
it
tell
as
time
goes
on
as
yet
we
are
but
at
the
beginning
of
our
subjugation
of
the
globe
we
have
hardly
explored
it
all
still

occupied
it
when
we
do
so
and
space
shall
have
become

precious
directness
of

with

have
partitioned
so
regularly
the

of
the

as
to
impart
to
it
an
artificiality
of
appearance
and
it
becomes
one
vast
coördinated
expanse
subservient
entirely
to
the
wants
of
its
possessors
centres
of
population
and
lines
of

with

carried
on
in
the
most
economic
way
to
this
it
must
come
in
the
end
nor
is
this
outcome
in
any
sense
a
circumstance
accidental
to
the
earth
it
is
an
inevitable
phase
in
the
evolution
of
organisms
as
the
organism
develops

it
is
able
to
circumvent
the
adversities
of
condition
and
by
overcoming
more
pronounced
inhospitality
of
environment
not
only
to
survive
but
spread
evidence
of
this
thought
will
be
stamped
more
and
more
visibly
upon
the
face
of
its
habitat
on
earth
for
all
our
pride
of
intellect
we
have
not
yet
progressed
very
far
from
the
lowly
animal
state
that
leaves
no
records
of
itself
it
is
only
in
the
last
two
centuries
that
our
upon
our
surroundings
has
been
marked
with
another
planet
the
like
course
must
in
all
probability
be
pursued
and
the
older
the
life
relatively
to
its
habitat
the
more
its
signs
of
occupation
should
show
intelligence
on
other
worlds
could
then
only
make
its
presence
known
by
such
material
revelation
and
the
of
itself
would
appear
more
artificial
in
look
as
that
life
was
high
in
rank
given
the
certainty
of
such
markings
are
what
one
would
look
to
find
criticism
which
refuses
to
credit
detail
of
the
sort
because
too
bizarre
to
be
true
writes
itself
down
as
unacquainted
with
the
character
of
the
problem
for
it
is
precisely
such
detail
which
should
show
if
any
evidence
at
all
were
forthcoming
if
now
we
turn
our
inquiry
to
mars
we
shall
be
fairly
startled
at
what
its
disk
discloses
for
we
find
ourselves
confronted
in
the
canals
and
oases
by
precisely
the
appearances
reasoning
proves
should
show
were
the
planet
inhabited
our
abstract
prognostications
have
taken
concrete
form
here
in
these
rectilineal
lines
and
roundish
spots
we
have
spread
out
our
centres
of
effort
and
our
lines
of
communication
for
the
oases
are
clearly
ganglia
to
which
the
canals
play
the
part
of
nerves
the
strange
geometricism
which
proves
inexplicable
on
any
other
hypothesis
now
shows
itself
of
the
essence
of
the
solution
the
appearance
of
artificiality
cast
up
at
the
phenomena
in
disproof
vindicates
itself
as
the
vital
point
in
the
whole
matter
like
the
cachet
of
an
architect
it
is
the
thing
about
the
building
that
established
the
authorship
though
the
earth
and
mars
agree
in
being
planets
they
differ
constitutionally
in
several
important
respects
even
to
us
the
curious
network
that
enshrouds
the
martian
disk
suggests
handicraft
it
implies
it
much
more
when
considered
from
a
martian
standpoint
chapter
xxxi
the
husbanding
of
water
that
the
canals
and
oases
are
of
artificial
origin
is
thus
suggested
by
their
very
look
when
we
come
to
go
further
and
inquire
into
what
may
be
their
office
in
the
planet
s
economy
we
find
that
the
idea
in
addition
to
its
general
probability
now
acquires
particular
support
for
this
we
are
indebted
in
part
to
study
of
their
static
aspect
but
chiefly
to
what
has
been
learnt
of
their
kinematic
action
dearth
of
water
is
the
key
to
their
character
water
is
very
scarce
on
the
planet
we
know
this
by
the
absence
of
any
bodies
of
it
of
any
size
upon
the
surface
so
far
as
we
can
see
the
only
available
water
is
what
comes
from
the
melting
at
one
or
the
other
cap
of
the
snow
accumulated
there
during
the
previous
winter
beyond
this
there
is
none
except
for
what
may
be
present
in
the
air
now
water
is
absolutely
essential
to
all
forms
of
life
no
organisms
can
exist
without
it
but
as
a
planet
ages
it
loses
its
oceans
as
has
before
been
explained
and
gradually
its
whole
water
supply
life
upon
its
surface
is
confronted
by
a
growing
scarcity
of
this
essential
to
existence
for
its
fauna
to
survive
it
must
utilize
all
it
can
get
to
this
end
it
would
be
obliged
to
put
forth
its
chief
endeavors
and
the
outcome
of
such
work
would
result
in
a
deformation
of
the
disk
indicative
of
its
presence
lines
of
communication
for
water
purposes
between
the
polar
caps
on
the
one
hand
and
the
centres
of
population
on
the
other
would
be
the
artificial
markings
we
should
expect
to
perceive
now
it
is
not
a
little
startling
that
the
semblance
of
just
such
signs
of
intelligent
interference
with
nature
is
what
we
discern
on
the
face
of
mars
the
canals
and
oases
so
dominant
in
its
mien
is
the
directness
of
the
canals
as
to
be
the
trait
that
primarily
strikes
an
unprejudiced
observer
who
beholds
this
astounding
system
of
lines
under
favorable
definition
for
the
first
time
and
its
impressiveness
only
grows
on
him
with
study
of
the
phenomena
that
they
suggested
rule
and
compass
schiaparelli
said
of
them
long
ago
without
committing
himself
as
to
what
they
were
in
perception
the
great
observer
was
as
usual
quite
right
and
the
better
they
are
seen
the
more
they
justify
the
statement
punctilious
in
their
precision
they
outdo
in
method
all
attempts
of
freehand
drawing
to
copy
them
often
has
the
writer
tried
to
represent
the
regularity
he
saw
only
to
draw
and
redraw
his
lines
in
vain
nothing
short
of
ruling
them
could
have
reproduced
what
the
telescope
revealed
strange
as
their
depiction
may
look
in
the
drawings
the
originals
look
stranger
still
indeed
that
they
should
look
unnatural
when
properly
depicted
is
not
unnatural
if
they
are
so
in
fact
for
it
is
the
geodetic
precision
which
the
lines
exhibit
that
instantly
stamps
them
to
consciousness
as
artificial
the
inference
is
so
forthright
as
to
be
shared
by
those
who
have
not
seen
them
to
the
extent
of
instant
denial
of
their
objectivity
drawings
of
them
look
too
strange
to
be
true
so
scepticism
imputes
to
the
draughtsman
their
artificial
fashioning
not
realizing
that
by
so
doing
it
bears
unconscious
witness
to
their
character
for
in
order
to
disprove
the
deduction
it
is
driven
to
deny
the
fact
now
the
fact
can
look
after
itself
and
will
be
recognized
in
time
for
that
the
lines
are
as
i
have
stated
is
beyond
doubt
each
return
of
the
planet
shows
them
more
and
more
geometric
as
sites
are
bettered
and
training
improves
suggestive
of
design
as
their
initial
appearance
is
the
idea
of
artificiality
receives
further
sanction
from
more
careful
consideration
even
from
a
static
point
of
view
on
at
least
eight
counts
their
straightness
their
individually
uniform
size
their
extreme
tenuity
the
dual
character
of
some
of
them
their
position
with
regard
to
the
planet
s
fundamental
features
their
relation
to
the
oases
the
character
of
these
spots
and
finally
the
systematic
networking
by
both
canals
and
spots
of
the
whole
surface
of
the
planet
now
no
natural
phenomena
within
our
knowledge
show
such
regularity
on
such
a
scale
upon
any
one
of
these
eight
counts
upon
all
when
one
considers
that
these
lines
run
for
thousands
of
miles
in
an
unswerving
direction
as
far
relatively
as
from
london
to
bombay
and
as
far
actually
as
from
boston
to
san
francisco
the
inadequacy
of
natural
explanation
becomes
glaring
these
several
counts
become
more
expressive
of
design
the
farther
one
looks
into
them
straightness
upon
a
sphere
means
the
following
of
an
arc
of
a
great
circle
the
lines
then
are
arcs
of
great
circles
now
the
great
circle
course
is
the
shortest
distance
connecting
two
given
points
the
canals
of
mars
then
practice
this
economy
they
connect
their
terminals
by
the
shortest
that
is
other
things
equal
by
the
quickest
and
least
wasteful
path
their
preserving
a
uniform
width
throughout
this
distance
is
an
equally
unnatural
feature
for
any
natural
action
to
exhibit
but
a
perfectly
natural
one
for
an
unnatural
agent
for
means
of
communication
for
whatever
cause
would
probably
be
fashioned
of
like
countenance
throughout
their
extreme
tenuity
is
a
third
trait
pointing
to
artificiality
inasmuch
as
the
narrower
they
are
the
more
probable
is
their
construction
by
local
intelligence
even
more
inexplicable
except
from
intent
is
their
dual
character
for
them
to
parallel
one
another
like
the
twin
rails
of
a
railway
track
seems
quite
beyond
the
powers
of
natural
causation
enigmatic
indeed
from
a
natural
standpoint
they
cease
to
be
so
enigmatic
viewed
from
an
artificial
one
and
this
the
more
by
reason
of
what
has
lately
been
learnt
of
the
character
of
their
distribution
that
they
are
found
most
plentifully
near
the
equator
where
the
latitudinal
girth
is
greatest
and
thence
diminish
in
numbers
to
about
latitude
where
they
disappear
this
not
relatively
to
the
amount
of
surface
but
actually
very
significant
it
is
quite
incapable
of
natural
explanation
and
can
only
be
accounted
for
on
some
theory
of
design
such
as
lines
of
communication
or
canals
conducting
water
down
the
latitudes
for
distribution
so
that
this
distribution
of
the
doubles
is
in
keeping
with
the
law
of
development
disclosed
by
the
canals
channels
and
the
two
lines
of
the
pair
may
be
but
about
this
we
can
at
present
posit
nothing
the
relation
may
be
of
still
greater
complexity
and
we
must
carefully
distinguish
between
surmise
and
deduction
the
position
of
the
canals
with
regard
to
the
main
features
of
the
disk
has
a
cogency
of
its
own
an
argument
from
time
the
places
from
which
the
lines
start
and
to
which
they
go
are
such
as
to
imply
a
dependence
of
the
latter
upon
the
former
chronologically
the
lines
are
logically
superposed
upon
the
natural
features
not
as
if
they
had
grown
there
but
as
if
they
had
been
placed
there
for
topographic
cause
those
termini
are
used
which
we
should
ourselves
select
for
stations
of
intercommunication
for
the
lines
not
only
leave
important
geodetic
points
but
they
travel
directly
to
equally
salient
ones
the
connection
of
the
canals
with
the
oases
is
no
less
telltale
of
intent
the
spots
are
found
only
at
junctions
clearly
the
seal
and
sanction
of
such
rendezvous
their
relation
to
the
canals
that
enter
them
bespeaks
method
and
design
centring
single
lines
they
are
inclosed
by
doubles
a
disposition
such
as
would
be
true
did
they
hold
a
pivotal
position
in
the
planet
s
economy
the
shape
of
the
oases
also
suggests
significance
their
form
is
round
a
solid
circle
of
shading
of
so
deep
a
tone
as
to
seem
black
although
undoubtedly
in
truth
now
a
circular
area
has
this
peculiar
property
that
it
incloses
for
a
given
length
of
perimeter
the
maximum
of
space
any
other
area
has
a
longer
inclosing
boundary
for
the
surface
inclosed
considering
each
area
to
be
made
up
of
envelops
to
an
original
core
each
similar
in
shape
to
the
kernel
we
see
that
the
property
in
question
means
that
the
average
distance
for
points
of
the
circular
area
from
the
centre
is
less
than
the
same
distance
for
those
of
any
other
figure
this
has
immediate
bearing
on
the
possible
fashioning
of
such
areas
for
sufficient
intelligence
in
the
fashioners
would
certainly
lead
to
a
construction
where
the
greatest
area
could
be
attended
to
at
the
least
expenditure
of
force
this
would
be
where
the
distance
to
be
traveled
from
the
centre
to
all
the
desired
points
was
on
the
average
least
that
is
the
area
would
be
round
but
last
and
in
its
import
is
the
system
which
the
canals
form
instead
of
running
at
haphazard
the
canals
are
interconnected
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
they
seek
centres
instead
of
avoiding
them
the
centres
are
linked
thus
perfectly
one
with
another
an
arrangement
which
could
not
result
from
centres
whether
of
explosion
or
otherwise
which
were
themselves
discrete
furthermore
the
system
covers
the
whole
surface
of
the
planet
dark
areas
and
light
ones
alike
a
distribution
which
exceeds
the
bounds
of
natural
possibility
any
force
which
could
act
longitudinally
on
such
a
scale
must
be
limited
latitudinally
in
its
action
as
witness
the
belts
of
jupiter
or
the
spots
upon
the
sun
rotational
climatic
or
other
physical
cause
could
not
fail
of
zonal
expression
yet
these
lines
are
grandly
indifferent
to
such
compelling
influences
finally
the
system
after
meshing
the
surface
in
its
entirety
runs
straight
into
the
polar
caps
it
is
then
a
system
whose
end
and
aim
is
the
tapping
of
the
for
the
water
there
semiannually
let
loose
then
to
distribute
it
over
the
planet
s
face
function
of
this
very
sort
is
evidenced
by
the
look
of
the
canals
further
study
during
the
last
eleven
years
as
to
their
behavior
leads
to
a
like
conclusion
while
at
the
same
time
it
goes
much
farther
by
revealing
the
action
in
the
case
this
action
proves
to
be
not
only
in
accord
with
the
theory
but
interestingly
explanatory
of
the
process
in
the
first
place
the
canals
have
shown
themselves
as
they
showed
to
schiaparelli
to
be
seasonal
phenomena
this
negatives
afresh
the
possibility
of
their
being
cracks
but
furthermore
their
seasonal
behavior
turns
out
to
follow
a
law
quite
different
from
what
we
know
on
earth
and
betokens
that
they
are
indebted
to
the
melting
of
the
polar
cap
for
their
annual
growth
even
more
directly
than
to
the
sun
and
that
vegetation
is
the
only
thing
that
satisfactorily
accounts
for
their
conduct
but
again
this
is
not
all
their
time
of
quickening
proceeds
with
singular
uniformity
down
the
disk
not
only
to
but
the
now
this
last
fact
has
peculiar
significance
so
large
are
the
planetary
masses
that
no
substance
can
resist
the
strains
due
to
the
cosmic
forces
acting
on
them
to
change
their
shape
till
it
becomes
one
of
stable
equilibrium
thus
a
body
of
planetary
size
if
unrotating
becomes
a
sphere
except
for
solar
tidal
deformation
if
rotating
it
takes
on
a
spheroidal
form
exactly
expressive
as
far
as
observation
goes
of
the
centrifugal
force
at
work
mars
presents
such
a
figure
being
flattened
out
to
correspond
to
its
axial
rotation
its
surface
therefore
is
in
fluid
equilibrium
or
in
other
words
a
particle
of
liquid
at
any
point
of
its
surface
at
the
present
time
would
stay
where
it
was
devoid
of
inclination
to
move
elsewhere
now
the
water
which
quickens
the
verdure
of
the
canals
moves
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
pole
down
to
the
equator
as
the
season
advances
this
it
does
then
irrespective
of
gravity
no
natural
force
propels
it
and
the
inference
is
forthright
and
inevitable
that
it
is
artificially
helped
to
its
end
there
seems
to
be
no
escape
from
this
deduction
water
flows
only
downhill
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
downhill
on
a
surface
already
in
fluid
equilibrium
a
few
canals
might
presumably
be
so
situated
that
their
flow
could
by
inequality
of
terrane
lie
equatorward
but
not
all
as
we
see
on
the
earth
rivers
flow
impartially
to
all
points
of
the
compass
dependent
only
upon
unevenness
of
the
local
surface
conditions
now
it
is
not
in
particular
but
by
general
consent
that
the
canal
system
of
mars
develops
from
pole
to
equator
from
the
respective
times
at
which
the
minima
take
place
it
appears
that
the
occupies
days
as
evidenced
by
the
successive
vegetal
darkenings
to
descend
from
latitude
north
to
latitude
a
journey
of
miles
this
gives
for
the
water
a
speed
of
miles
a
day
or
miles
an
hour
the
rate
of
progression
is
remarkably
uniform
and
this
abets
the
deduction
as
to
assisted
transference
the
simple
fact
that
it
is
carried
from
near
the
pole
to
the
equator
is
sufficiently
telltale
of
extrinsic
aid
but
the
uniformity
of
the
action
increases
its
significance
but
the
fact
is
more
unnatural
yet
the
growth
pays
no
regard
to
the
equator
but
proceeds
across
it
as
if
it
did
not
exist
into
the
planet
s
other
hemisphere
here
is
something
still
more
telling
than
its
travel
to
this
point
for
even
if
we
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
natural
forces
took
the
water
down
to
the
equator
their
action
must
there
be
certainly
reversed
and
the
equator
prove
a
to
pass
which
were
impossible
chapter

conclusion
that
mars
is
inhabited
by
beings
of
some
sort
or
other
we
may
consider
as
certain
as
it
is
uncertain
what
those
beings
may
be
the
theory
of
the
existence
of
intelligent
life
on
mars
may
be
likened
to
the
atomic
theory
in
chemistry
in
that
in
both
we
are
led
to
the
belief
in
units
which
we
are
alike
unable
to
define
both
theories
explain
the
facts
in
their
respective
fields
and
are
the
only
theories
that
do
while
as
to
what
an
atom
may
resemble
we
know
as
little
as
what
a
martian
may
be
like
but
the
behavior
of
chemic
compounds
points
to
the
existence
of
atoms
too
small
for
us
to
see
and
in
the
same
way
the
aspect
and
behavior
of
the
martian
markings
implies
the
action
of
agents
too
far
away
to
be
made
out
but
though
in
neither
case
can
we
tell
anything
of
the
bodily
form
of
its
unit
we
can
in
both
predicate
a
good
deal
about
their
workings
apart
from
the
general
fact
of
intelligence
implied
by
the
geometric
character
of
their
constructions
is
the
evidence
as
to
its
degree
afforded
by
the
cosmopolitan
extent
of
the
action
girdling
their
globe
and
stretching
from
pole
to
pole
the
martian
canal
system
not
only
embraces
their
whole
world
but
is
an
organized
entity
each
canal
joins
another
which
in
turn
connects
with
a
third
and
so
on
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
planet
this
continuity
of
construction
posits
a
community
of
interest
now
when
we
consider
that
though
not
so
large
as
the
earth
the
world
of
mars
is
one
of
miles
diameter
and
therefore
containing
something
like
of
square
miles
the
unity
of
the
process
acquires
considerable
significance
the
supposed
vast
enterprises
of
the
earth
look
small
beside
it
none
of
them
but
become
local
in
comparison
gigantic
as
they
seem
to
us
to
be
the
first
thing
that
is
forced
on
us
in
conclusion
is
the
necessarily
intelligent
and
character
of
the
community
which
could
thus
act
as
a
unit
throughout
its
globe
war
is
a
survival
among
us
from
savage
times
and
affects
now
chiefly
the
boyish
and
unthinking
element
of
the
nation
the
wisest
realize
that
there
are
better
ways
for
practicing
heroism
and
other
and
more
certain
ends
of
insuring
the
survival
of
the
fittest
it
is
something
a
people
outgrow
but
whether
they
consciously
practice
peace
or
not
nature
in
its
evolution
eventually
practices
it
for
them
and
after
enough
of
the
inhabitants
of
a
globe
have
killed
each
other
off
the
remainder
must
find
it
more
advantageous
to
work
together
for
the
common
good
whether
increasing
common
sense
or
increasing
necessity
was
the
spur
that
drove
the
martians
to
this
eminently
sagacious
state
we
can
not
say
but
it
is
certain
that
reached
it
they
have
and
equally
certain
that
if
they
had
not
they
must
all
die
when
a
planet
has
attained
to
the
age
of
advancing
decrepitude
and
the
remnant
of
its
water
supply
resides
simply
in
its
polar
caps
these
can
only
be
effectively
tapped
for
the
benefit
of
the
inhabitants
when
arctic
and
equatorial
peoples
are
at
one
difference
of
policy
on
the
question
of
the
water
supply
means
nothing
short
of
death
isolated
communities
can
not
there
be
sufficient
unto
themselves
they
must
combine
to
solidarity
or
perish
from
the
fact
therefore
that
the
reticulated
canal
system
is
an
elaborate
entity
embracing
the
whole
planet
from
one
pole
to
the
other
we
have
not
only
proof
of
the
sagacity
of
its
builders
but
a
very
suggestive
to
the
fact
that
only
a
universal
necessity
such
as
water
could
well
be
its
underlying
cause
possessed
of
important
bearing
upon
the
possibility
of
life
on
mars
is
the
rather
recent
appreciation
that
the
habitat
of
both
plants
and
animals
is
conditioned
not
by
the
minimum
nor
by
the
mean
temperature
of
the
locality
but
by
the
maximum
heat
attained
in
the
region
not
only
is
the
minimum
thermometric
point
no
determinator
of
a
but
even
a
mean
temperature
does
not
measure
organic
capability
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
continuance
of
the
species
seems
to
depend
solely
upon
the
possibility
of
reproduction
and
this
in
turn
upon
a
suitable
temperature
at
the
critical
period
of
the
plant
s
or
animal
s
career
contrary
to
previous
ideas
on
the
subject
merriam
found
this
to
be
the
case
with
the
fauna
of
the
san
francisco
peak
region
in
northern
arizona
the
region
was
peculiarly
fitted
for
a
test
because
of
rising
a
boreal
island
of
life
out
of
a
sea
of
desert
it
thus
reproduced
along
its
flanks
the
conditions
of
climates
farther
north
altitude
taking
the
part
of
latitude
one
succeeding
another
until
at
the
top
stood
the
arctic
zone
merriam
showed
that
the
existence
of
life
there
was
dependent
solely
upon
a
sufficiency
of
warmth
at
the
breeding
season
if
that
were
enough
the
animal
or
plant
propagated
its
kind
and
held
its
foothold
against
adverse
conditions
during
the
rest
of
the
year
this
it
did
by
living
during
its
brief
summer
and
then
going
into
hibernation
the
balance
of
the
time
nature
in
short
suspended
its
functions
to
a
large
extent
for
months
together
enabling
it
to
resurrect
when
the
conditions
turned
hibernation
proves
thus
to
be
a
trait
acquired
by
the
organism
in
consequence
of
climatic
conditions
like
all
such
it
can
only
be
developed
in
time
since
nature
is
incapable
of
abrupt
transition
an
animal
suddenly
transported
from
the
tropic
to
a
zone
will
perish
because
it
has
not
yet
learnt
the
trick
of
winter
sleeping
while
still
characterized
by
seasonal
insomnia
it
is
incapable
of
storing
its
energies
and
biding
its
time
but
given
time
enough
to
acquire
the
art
its
existence
is
determined
solely
by
the
enjoyment
of
heat
enough
at
some
season
to
permit
of
the
vital
possibility
of
reproducing
its
kind
diurnal
shutting
off
of
the
heat
affects
the
process
but
little
provided
the
fall
be
not
below
freezing
at
the
hottest
season
so
much
is
shown
by
the
fauna
of
our
arctic
and
zones
but
still
more
pertinently
to
mars
by
the
zones
of
the
san
francisco
peak
region
since
the
thinner
air
of
altitude
through
which
a
greater
amount
of
heat
can
radiate
off
is
there
substituted
for
the
thicker
one
of
latitudinally
equal
isotherms
here
again
with
the
diurnal
as
before
with
the
seasonal
it
is
the
maximum
not
the
mean
or
till
low
even
the
minimum
temperature
that
tells
now
with
mars
the
state
of
things
is
completely
in
accord
with
what
is
thus
demanded
for
the
existence
of
life
the
martian
climate
is
one
of
extremes
where
considerable
heat
treads
on
the
heels
of
great
cold
and
the
one
of
these
two
conditions
is
as
certain
as
the
other
as
the
condition
of
the
planet
s
surface
shows
conclusively
in
summer
and
during
the
day
it
must
be
decidedly
hot
certainly
well
above
any
possible
freezing
a
thinner
air
blanket
actually
increasing
the
amount
of
heat
that
reaches
the
surface
though
affecting
the
length
of
time
of
its
retention
unfavorably
the
maximum
temperature
therefore
can
not
be
low
the
minimum
of
course
is
but
as
we
have
just
seen
it
is
the
maximum
that
regulates
the
possibility
of
life
in
spite
therefore
of
a
winter
probably
longer
and
colder
than
our
own
organic
life
is
not
in
the
least
debarred
from
finding
itself
there
indeed
the
conditions
appear
to
be
such
as
to
put
a
premium
upon
life
of
a
high
order
the
martian
year
being
twice
as
long
as
our
own
the
summer
is
there
proportionately
extended
even
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
one
where
the
summer
is
the
shortest
it
lasts
for
days
while
at
the
same
latitudes
our
own
is
but
days
this
lengthening
of
the
period
of
reproduction
can
not
but
have
an
elevating
effect
upon
the
organism
akin
to
the
prolongation
of
childhood
pointed
out
by
john
fiske
as
playing
so
important
a
part
in
the
evolution
of
the
highest
animals
day
and
night
on
the
other
hand
alternate
there
with
approximately
the
same
speed
as
here
and
except
for
what
is
due
to
a
thinner
air
covering
reproduce
our
own
terrestrial
diurnal
conditions
which
as
we
saw
are
not
inimical
to
life
in
this
respect
then
mars
proves
to
be
by
no
means
so
bad
a
habitat
it
offers
another
example
of
how
increasing
knowledge
widens
the
domain
that
life
may
occupy
just
as
we
have
now
found
organic
existence
in
abyssal
depths
of
sea
and
in
excessive
degrees
of
both
heat
and
cold
so
do
we
find
from
exploration
of
our
island
mountains
which
more
than
any
other
locality
on
earth
facsimile
the
martian
surface
its
possession
there
as
well
another
point
too
is
worth
consideration
in
an
aging
world
where
the
conditions
of
life
have
grown
more
difficult
mentality
must
characterize
more
and
more
its
beings
in
order
for
them
to
survive
and
would
in
consequence
tend
to
be
evolved
to
find
therefore
upon
mars
highly
intelligent
life
is
what
the
planet
s
state
would
lead
one
to
expect
to
some
people
it
may
seem
that
the
very
strangeness
of
martian
life
precludes
for
it
an
appeal
to
human
interest
to
me
this
is
but
a
view
the
less
the
life
there
proves
a
counterpart
of
our
earthly
state
of
things
the
more
it
fires
fancy
and
piques
inquiry
as
to
what
it
be
we
all
have
felt
this
impulse
in
our
childhood
as
our
ancestors
did
before
us
when
they
conjured
goblins
and
spirits
from
the
vasty
void
and
if
our
energy
continue
we
never
cease
to
feel
its
force
through
life
we
but
exchange
as
our
years
increase
the
romance
of
fiction
for
the
more
thrilling
romance
of
fact
as
we
grow
older
we
demand
reality
but
so
this
requisite
be
fulfilled
the
stranger
the
realization
the
better
we
are
pleased
perhaps
it
is
the
more
vivid
imagination
of
youth
that
enables
us
all
then
to
dispense
with
the
of
actuality
upon
our
cherished
visions
perhaps
a
deeper
sense
of
our
own
oneness
with
nature
as
we
get
on
makes
us
insist
upon
getting
the
real
thing
whatever
the
reason
be
certain
it
is
that
with
the
years
a
narration
no
matter
how
enthralling
takes
added
hold
of
us
for
being
true
but
though
we
crave
this
solid
foothold
for
our
conceptions
we
yield
on
that
account
no
jot
or
tittle
of
our
interest
for
the
unexpected
good
reason
we
have
for
the
allurement
we
feel
toward
what
is
least
like
us
for
the
wider
the
separation
from
the
familiar
the
greater
the
parallax
the
new
affords
for
cosmic
comprehension
that
which
differs
little
yields
little
to
the
knowledge
already
possessed
just
as
a
longer
base
line
gives
us
a
better
measure
of
the
distance
of
the
sun
so
here
the
more
diverse
the
aspects
the
farther
back
they
push
the
common
and
furnish
proportionately
comprehensive
insight
into
the
course
by
which
each
came
to
be
what
it
is
by
studying
others
we
learn
about
ourselves
and
though
from
the
remote
we
learn
less
easily
we
eventually
learn
the
more
even
on
the
side
then
that
touches
most
men
the
personal
the
strangeness
of
the
subject
should
to
the
prove
all
the
greater
magnet
one
of
the
things
that
makes
mars
of
such
transcendent
interest
to
man
is
the
foresight
it
affords
of
the
course
earthly
evolution
is
to
pursue
on
our
own
world
we
are
able
only
to
study
our
present
and
our
past
in
mars
we
are
able
to
glimpse
in
some
sort
our
future
different
as
the
course
of
life
on
the
two
planets
undoubtedly
has
been
the
one
helps
however
imperfectly
to
better
understanding
of
the
other
another
more
abstract
but
no
less
alluring
appeals
to
that
desire
innate
in
man
to
know
about
the
cosmos
of
which
he
forms
a
part
and
which
we
call
by
the
name
of
science
study
of
mars
responds
to
this
craving
both
directly
by
revelation
of
the
secrets
of
another
world
and
indirectly
by
the
bearing
of
what
we
thus
learn
upon
our
understanding
of
the
laws
of
the
universe
for
the
facts
thus
acquired
broaden
our
conceptions
in
every
branch
of
science
some
day
our
own
geology
meteorology
and
the
rest
will
stand
indebted
to
study
of
the
planet
mars
for
advance
along
their
respective
lines
already
the
most
alert
of
those
professing
them
are
lending
ear
to
information
from
this
source
and
such
cosmopolitanism
can
but
increase
as
the
years
roll
on
today
what
we
already
know
is
helping
to
comprehension
of
another
world
in
a
not
distant
future
we
shall
be
repaid
with
interest
and
what
that
other
world
shall
have
taught
us
will
redound

and
