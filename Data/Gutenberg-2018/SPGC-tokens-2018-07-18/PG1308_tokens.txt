preface
to
my
personal
attitude
towards
confess
in
brief
the
my
works
are
good
and
of
any
importance
whatever
for
the
further
development
of
will
maintain
their
place
in
spite
of
all
adverse
criticism
and
in
spite
of
all
hateful
suspicions
attached
to
my
artistic
my
works
are
of
no
most
gratifying
success
of
the
moment
and
the
most
enthusiastic
approval
of
as
augurs
can
not
make
them
press
can
devour
them
as
it
has
devoured
many
i
will
not
shed
a
tear
and
the
world
will
move
on
just
the
strauss
the
contents
of
this
volume
require
some
explanation
of
an
historical
nature
it
is
scarcely
realised
by
the
present
generation
that
wilde
s
works
on
their
first
appearance
with
the
exception
of
were
met
with
almost
general
condemnation
and
ridicule
the
plays
on
their
first
production
were
grudgingly
praised
because
their
obvious
success
could
not
be
ignored
but
on
their
subsequent
publication
in
book
form
they
were
violently
assailed
that
nearly
all
of
them
have
held
the
stage
is
still
a
source
of
irritation
among
certain
journalists
however
enjoys
a
singular
career
as
every
one
knows
it
was
prohibited
by
the
censor
when
in
rehearsal
by
madame
bernhardt
at
the
palace
theatre
in
on
its
publication
in
it
was
greeted
with
greater
abuse
than
any
other
of
wilde
s
works
and
was
consigned
to
the
usual
irrevocable
oblivion
the
accuracy
of
the
french
was
freely
canvassed
and
of
course
it
is
obvious
that
the
french
is
not
that
of
a
frenchman
the
play
was
passed
for
press
however
by
no
less
a
writer
than
marcel
schwob
whose
letter
to
the
paris
publisher
returning
the
proofs
and
mentioning
two
or
three
slight
alterations
is
still
in
my
possession
marcel
schwob
told
me
some
years
afterwards
that
he
thought
it
would
have
spoiled
the
spontaneity
and
character
of
wilde
s
style
if
he
had
tried
to
harmonise
it
with
the
diction
demanded
by
the
french
academy
it
was
never
composed
with
any
idea
of
presentation
madame
bernhardt
happened
to
say
she
wished
wilde
would
write
a
play
for
her
he
replied
in
jest
that
he
had
done
so
she
insisted
on
seeing
the
manuscript
and
decided
on
its
immediate
production
ignorant
or
forgetful
of
the
english
law
which
prohibits
the
introduction
of
scriptural
characters
on
the
stage
with
his
keen
sense
of
the
theatre
wilde
would
never
have
contrived
the
long
speech
of
salomé
at
the
end
in
a
drama
intended
for
the
stage
even
in
the
days
of
long
speeches
his
threat
to
change
his
nationality
shortly
after
the
censor
s
interference
called
forth
a
most
delightful
and
caricature
of
him
by
bernard
partridge
in
wilde
was
still
in
prison
in
when
was
produced
by
lugne
poë
at
the
théàtre
de
l
œuvre
in
paris
but
except
for
an
account
in
the
the
incident
was
hardly
mentioned
in
england
i
gather
that
the
performance
was
only
a
qualified
success
though
lugne
poë
s
triumph
as
herod
was
generally
acknowledged
in
within
a
year
of
the
author
s
death
it
was
produced
in
berlin
from
that
moment
it
has
held
the
european
stage
it
has
run
for
a
longer
consecutive
period
in
germany
than
any
play
by
any
englishman
not
excepting
shakespeare
its
popularity
has
extended
to
all
countries
where
it
is
not
prohibited
it
is
performed
throughout
europe
asia
and
america
it
is
played
even
in
yiddish
this
is
remarkable
in
view
of
the
many
dramas
by
french
and
german
writers
who
treat
of
the
same
theme
to
none
of
them
however
is
wilde
indebted
flaubert
maeterlinck
some
would
add
ollendorff
and
scripture
are
the
obvious
sources
on
which
he
has
freely
drawn
for
what
i
do
not
hesitate
to
call
the
most
powerful
and
perfect
of
all
his
dramas
but
on
such
a
point
a
trustee
and
executor
may
be
prejudiced
because
it
is
the
most
valuable
asset
in
wilde
s
literary
estate
aubrey
beardsley
s
illustrations
are
too
well
known
to
need
more
than
a
passing
reference
in
the
world
of
art
criticism
they
excited
almost
as
much
attention
as
wilde
s
drama
has
excited
in
the
world
of
intellect
during
may
the
play
was
produced
in
england
for
the
first
time
at
a
private
performance
by
the
new
stage
club
no
one
present
will
have
forgotten
the
extraordinary
tension
of
the
audience
on
that
occasion
those
who
disliked
the
play
and
its
author
being
hypnotised
by
the
extraordinary
power
of
robert
farquharson
s
herod
one
of
the
finest
pieces
of
acting
ever
seen
in
this
country
my
friends
the
dramatic
critics
and
many
of
them
are
personal
friends
fell
on
with
all
the
vigour
of
their
predecessors
twelve
years
before
unaware
of
what
was
taking
place
in
germany
they
spoke
of
the
play
as
having
been
dragged
from
the
official
receiver
in
bankruptcy
and
myself
were
however
better
informed
and
much
pleasure
has
been
derived
from
reading
those
criticisms
all
carefully
preserved
along
with
the
list
of
receipts
which
were
simultaneously
pouring
in
from
the
german
performances
to
do
the
critics
justice
they
never
withdrew
any
of
their
printed
opinions
which
were
all
trotted
out
again
when
the
play
was
produced
privately
for
the
second
time
in
england
by
the
literary
theatre
society
in
in
the
of
july
however
some
of
the
iterated
misrepresentations
of
fact
were
corrected
no
attempt
was
made
to
controvert
the
opinion
of
an
ignorant
critic
his
veracity
only
was
impugned
the
powers
of
vaticination
possessed
by
such
judges
of
drama
can
be
fairly
tested
in
the
career
of
on
the
european
stage
apart
from
the
opera
in
an
introduction
to
the
english
translation
published
by
john
lane
it
is
pointed
out
that
wilde
s
confusion
of
herod
antipas
matt
xiv
with
herod
the
great
matt
ii
and
herod
agrippa
i
acts
xii
is
intentional
and
follows
a
mediæval
convention
there
is
no
attempt
at
historical
accuracy
or
archæological
exactness
those
who
saw
the
marvellous
of
charles
ricketts
at
the
second
english
production
can
form
a
complete
idea
of
what
wilde
intended
in
that
respect
although
the
stage
management
was
clumsy
and
amateurish
the
great
opera
of
richard
strauss
does
not
fall
within
my
province
but
the
fag
ends
of
its
popularity
on
the
continent
have
been
imported
here
oddly
enough
through
the
agency
of
the
palace
theatre
where
was
originally
to
have
been
performed
of
a
young
lady
s
dancing
or
of
that
of
her
rivals
i
am
not
qualified
to
speak
i
note
merely
that
the
critics
who
objected
to
the
horror
of
one
incident
in
the
drama
lost
all
on
seeing
that
incident
repeated
in
dumb
show
and
accompanied
by
fescennine
corybantics
except
in
name
and
borrowed
notoriety
the
sensation
has
no
relation
whatever
to
the
drama
which
so
profoundly
moved
the
whole
of
europe
and
the
greatest
living
musician
the
adjectives
of
contumely
are
easily
transmuted
into
epithets
of
adulation
when
a
prominent
ecclesiastic
succumbs
like
king
herod
to
the
fascination
of
a
dancer
it
is
not
usually
known
in
england
that
a
young
french
naval
officer
unaware
that
strauss
was
composing
an
opera
on
the
theme
of
wrote
another
music
drama
to
accompany
wilde
s
text
the
exclusive
musical
rights
having
been
already
secured
by
strauss
lieutenant
marriotte
s
work
can
not
be
performed
regularly
one
presentation
however
was
permitted
at
lyons
the
composer
s
native
town
where
i
am
told
it
made
an
extraordinary
impression
in
order
to
give
english
readers
some
faint
idea
of
the
effect
of
wilde
s
drama
my
friend
walter
ledger
has
prepared
a
short
bibliography
of
certain
english
and
continental
translations
at
the
time
of
wilde
s
trial
the
nearly
completed
of
sainte
was
entrusted
to
leverson
the
novelist
who
in
went
to
paris
on
purpose
to
restore
it
to
the
author
wilde
immediately
left
the
only
copy
in
a
cab
a
few
days
later
he
laughingly
informed
me
of
the
loss
and
added
that
a
cab
was
a
very
proper
place
for
it
i
have
explained
elsewhere
that
he
looked
on
his
works
with
disdain
in
his
last
years
though
he
was
always
full
of
schemes
for
writing
others
all
my
attempts
to
recover
the
lost
work
failed
the
passages
here
reprinted
are
from
some
odd
leaves
of
a
first
draft
the
play
is
of
course
not
unlike
though
it
was
written
in
english
it
expanded
wilde
s
favourite
theory
that
when
you
convert
some
one
to
an
idea
you
lose
your
faith
in
it
the
same
motive
runs
through
honorius
the
hermit
so
far
as
i
recollect
the
story
falls
in
love
with
the
courtesan
who
has
come
to
tempt
him
and
he
reveals
to
her
the
secret
of
the
love
of
god
she
immediately
becomes
a
christian
and
is
murdered
by
robbers
honorius
the
hermit
goes
back
to
alexandria
to
pursue
a
life
of
pleasure
two
other
similar
plays
wilde
invented
in
prison
and
and
he
would
never
write
them
down
though
often
importuned
to
do
so
was
intensely
dramatic
and
perhaps
more
original
than
any
of
the
group
none
of
these
works
must
be
confused
with
the
manuscripts
stolen
from
tite
street
in
the
enlarged
version
of
the
second
draft
of
florentine
and
duchess
of
which
existing
in
a
prompt
copy
was
of
less
importance
than
the
others
nor
with
cardinal
of
the
manuscript
of
which
i
never
saw
i
scarcely
think
it
ever
existed
though
wilde
used
to
recite
proposed
passages
for
it
some
years
after
wilde
s
death
i
was
looking
over
the
papers
and
letters
rescued
from
tite
street
when
i
came
across
loose
sheets
of
manuscript
and
typewriting
which
i
imagined
were
fragments
of
duchess
of
on
putting
them
together
in
a
coherent
form
i
recognised
that
they
belonged
to
the
lost
i
assumed
that
the
opening
scene
though
once
extant
had
disappeared
one
day
however
willard
wrote
that
he
possessed
a
typewritten
fragment
of
a
play
which
wilde
had
submitted
to
him
and
this
he
kindly
forwarded
for
my
inspection
it
agreed
in
nearly
every
particular
with
what
i
had
taken
so
much
trouble
to
put
together
this
suggests
that
the
opening
scene
had
never
been
written
as
willard
s
version
began
where
mine
did
it
was
characteristic
of
the
author
to
finish
what
he
never
began
when
the
literary
theatre
society
produced
in
they
asked
me
for
some
other
short
drama
by
wilde
to
present
at
the
same
time
as
does
not
take
very
long
to
play
i
offered
them
the
fragment
of
florentine
by
a
fortunate
coincidence
the
poet
and
dramatist
thomas
sturge
moore
happened
to
be
on
the
committee
of
this
society
and
to
him
was
entrusted
the
task
of
writing
an
opening
scene
to
make
the
play
complete
it
is
not
for
me
to
criticise
his
work
but
there
is
justification
for
saying
that
wilde
himself
would
have
envied
with
an
artist
s
envy
such
lines
we
will
sup
with
the
moon
like
persian
princes
that
in
babylon
sup
in
the
hanging
gardens
of
the
king
in
a
stylistic
sense
sturge
moore
has
accomplished
a
feat
in
reconstruction
whatever
opinions
may
be
held
of
florentine
by
wilde
s
admirers
or
detractors
the
achievement
is
particularly
remarkable
because
sturge
moore
has
nothing
in
common
with
wilde
other
than
what
is
shared
by
all
real
poets
and
dramatists
he
is
a
landed
proprietor
on
parnassus
not
a
trespasser
in
england
we
are
more
familiar
with
the
poachers
time
and
death
are
of
course
necessary
before
there
can
come
any
adequate
recognition
of
one
of
our
most
original
and
gifted
singers
among
his
works
are
vinedresser
and
other
chronicle
and
centaur
s
sturge
moore
is
also
an
art
critic
of
distinction
and
his
learned
works
on
dürer
and
correggio
are
more
widely
known
i
am
sorry
to
say
than
his
powerful
and
enthralling
poems
once
again
i
must
express
my
obligations
to
stuart

have
talked
with
people
who

some
say
he

but
that
may
not
be
true

what
gods
then
do
ye
worship
or
do
ye
worship
any
gods
there
are
those
who
have
no

the

who
wear
long

brown
cloaks
have
no

to

the
laugh
at

we
worship
seven

we
may
not
tell

it
is
a
very
dangerous
thing
to
tell

no
one
should
ever
tell
the

his

by
an
embalmer
of

who
had
found

in
a
tomb
we
served
him
for
seven
years
myrrhina
the
dead
are
terrible
i
am
afraid
of
death
first
man
death
is
not
a
god
he
is
only
the
servant
of
the
gods
myrrhina
he
is
the
only
god
i
am
afraid
of
ye
have
seen
many
of
the
gods
first
man
we
have
seen
many
of
them
one
sees
them
chiefly
at
night
time
they
pass
one
by
very
swiftly
once
we
saw
some
of
the
gods
at
daybreak
they
were
walking
across
a
plain
myrrhina
once
as
i
was
passing
through
the
market
place
i
heard
a
sophist
from
cilicia
say
that
there
is
only
one
god
he
said
it
before
many
people
first
man
that
can
not
be
true
we
have
ourselves
seen
many
though
we
are
but
common
men
and
of
no
account
when
i
saw
them
i
hid
myself
in
a
bush
they
did
me
no
harm
myrrhina
tell
me
more
about
the
beautiful
young
hermit
talk
to
me
about
the
beautiful
young
hermit
who
will
not
look
on
the
face
of
woman
what
is
the
story
of
his
days
what
mode
of
life
has
he
first
man
we
do
not
understand
you
myrrhina
what
does
he
do
the
beautiful
young
hermit
does
he
sow
or
reap
does
he
plant
a
garden
or
catch
fish
in
a
net
does
he
weave
linen
on
a
loom
does
he
set
his
hand
to
the
wooden
plough
and
walk
behind
the
oxen
second
man
he
being
a
very
holy
man
does
nothing
we
are
common
men
and
of
no
account
we
toll
all
day
long
in
the
sun
sometimes
the
ground
is
very
hard
myrrhina
do
the
birds
of
the
air
feed
him
do
the
jackals
share
their
booty
with
him
first
man
every
evening
we
bring
him
food
we
do
not
think
that
the
birds
of
the
air
feed
him
myrrhina
why
do
ye
feed
him
what
profit
have
ye
in
so
doing
second
man
he
is
a
very
holy
man
one
of
the
gods
whom
he
has
offended

made
him
mad
we
think
he
has
offended
the
moon
myrrhina
go
and
tell
him
that
one
who
has
come
from
alexandria
desires
to
speak
with
him
first
man
we
dare
not
tell
him
this
hour
he
is
praying
to
his
god
we
pray
thee
to
pardon
us
for
not
doing
thy
bidding
myrrhina
are
ye
afraid
of
him

we
are
afraid
of
him
myrrhina
why
are
ye
afraid
of
him
first
man
we
do
not
know
myrrhina
what
is
his

the
voice
that
speaks
to
him
at

by

of
honorius
it
was
also
by
the
name
of
honorius
that
the
three
lepers
who
passed
by
once
called
to
him
we
think
that
his
name
is
honorius
myrrhina
why
did
the
three
lepers
call
to
him
first
man
that
he
might
heal
them
myrrhina
did
he
heal
them
second
man
no
they
had
committed
some
sin
it
was
for
that
reason
they
were
lepers
their
hands
and
faces
were
like
salt
one
of
them
wore
a
mask
of
linen
he
was
a
king

son
myrrhina
what
is
the
voice
that
speaks
to
him
at
night
time
in
his
cave
first
man
we
do
not
know
whose
voice
it
is
we
think
it
is
the
voice
of
his
god
for
we
have
seen
no
man
enter
his
cavern
nor
any
come
forth
from

porphyry
chamber
and
set
sail
in

litter
he
was
pale
as
a
narcissus
and
his
body
was
like
honey
the
son
of

himself
in
my
honour
and
the
tetrarch
of

himself
for

pleasure
before

set
carpets
for

in
the
circus
and
the
gladiators
fight
beneath
me
once
a
thracian
who
was
my
lover
was
caught
in
the
net
i
gave
the
signal
for
him
to
die
and
the
whole
theatre
applauded

i
pass
through
the
gymnasium
and
watch
the
young
men
wrestling
or
in
the
race
their
bodies
are
bright
with
oil
and
their
brows
are
wreathed
with
willow
sprays
and
with
myrtle
they
stamp
their
feet
on
the
sand
when
they
wrestle
and
when
they
run
the
sand
follows
them
like
a
little
cloud
he
at
whom
i
smile
leaves
his
companions
and
follows
me
to
my
home
at
other
times
i
go
down
to
the

and
watch
the
merchants
unloading
their
vessels
those
that

cloaks
of
silk
and
earrings
of
emerald
those
that
come
from

when
they
see
me
coming
they
stand
on
the
prows
of
their
ships
and
call
to
me
but
i
do
not
answer
them
i
go
to
the
little
taverns
where
the
sailors
lie
all
day
long
drinking
black
wine
and
playing
with
dice
and
i
sit
down
with
them
i
made
the
prince
my
slave
and
his
slave
who
was
a
tyrian
i
made
my
lord
for
the
space
of
a
moon

and
pour
spikenard
on
your
hair
i
will
clothe
you
in
hyacinth
and
put
honey
in
your
mouth
honorius
there
is
no
love
but
the
love
of
god
myrrhina
who
is
he
whose
love
is
greater
than
that
of
mortal
men
honorius
it
is
he
whom
thou
seest
on
the
cross
myrrhina
he
is
the
son
of
god
and
was
born
of
a
virgin
three
wise
men
who
were
kings
brought
him
offerings
and
the
shepherds
who
were
lying
on
the
hills
were
wakened
by
a
great
light
the
sibyls
knew
of
his
coming
the
groves
and
the
oracles
spake
of
him
david
and
the
prophets
announced
him
there
is
no
love
like
the
love
of
god
nor
any
love
that
can
be
compared
to
it
the
body
is
vile
myrrhina
god
will
raise
thee
up
with
a
new
body
which
will
not
know
corruption
and
thou
shalt
dwell
in
the
courts
of
the
lord
and
see
him
whose
hair
is
like
fine
wool
and
whose
feet
are
of
brass
myrrhina
the
beauty
honorius
the
beauty
of
the
soul
increases
until
it
can
see
god
therefore
myrrhina
repent
of
thy
sins
the
robber
who
was
crucified
beside
him
he
brought
into
paradise
myrrhina
how
strangely
he
spake
to
me
and
with
what
scorn
did
he
regard
me
i
wonder
why
he
spake
to
me
so
strangely
honorius
myrrhina
the
scales
have
fallen
from
my
eyes
and
i
see
now
clearly
what
i
did
not
see
before
take
me
to
alexandria
and
let
me
taste
of
the
seven
sins
myrrhina
do
not
mock
me
honorius
nor
speak
to
me
with
such
bitter
words
for
i
have
repented
of
my
sins
and
i
am
seeking
a
cavern
in
this
desert
where
i
too
may
dwell
so
that
my
soul
may
become
worthy
to
see
god
honorius
the
sun
is
setting
myrrhina
come
with
me
to
alexandria
myrrhina
i
will
not
go
to
alexandria
honorius
farewell
myrrhina
myrrhina
honorius
farewell
no
no
do
not
go
i
have
cursed
my
beauty
for
what
it
has
done
and
cursed
the
wonder
of
my
body
for
the
evil
that
it
has
brought
upon
you
lord
this
man
brought
me
to
thy
feet
he
told
me
of
thy
coming
upon
earth
and
of
the
wonder
of
thy
birth
and
the
great
wonder
of
thy
death
also
by
him
o
lord
thou
wast
revealed
to
me
honorius
you
talk
as
a
child
myrrhina
and
without
knowledge
loosen
your
hands
why
didst
thou
come
to
this
valley
in
thy
beauty
myrrhina
the
god
whom
thou
worshippest
led
me
here
that
i
might
repent
of
my
iniquities
and
know
him
as
the
lord
honorius
why
didst
thou
tempt
me
with
words
myrrhina
that
thou
shouldst
see
sin
in
its
painted
mask
and
look
on
death
in
its
robe

not
my

nor
loves
any
man
else
yet
she
might
like
to
love
if
she
were
loved
by

well
for
she

weary

do
if
i
should
call
to
pay
respect
unto
your
our
lovely
mistress

that
i

this
ribbon
weighted

maria
be
you
busy

the
young
lord
in
for
hark
he
knocks
maria
great
ladies
might
he
choose
from
and
yet
he
is
drawn
ah
there
my
fear
is
was
he
drawn
by
love
to
love
s
young
strength
alone
that
s
where
it
is
if
i
were
sure
he
loved
i
then
might
do
what
greater
dames
have
done
and
venge
me
on
a
husband
blind
to
beauty
but
if
ah
if
he
is
a
wandering
bee
mere
gallant
taster
who
befools
poor
flowers
maria
the
door
guido
bardi
then
my
lord
i
learn
that
we
have
something
here
in
this
poor
house
which
thou
dost
wish
to
buy
my
husband
is
from
home
but
my
poor
fate
has
made
me
perfect
in
the
price
of
velvets
of
silks
and
gay
brocades
i
think
you
offered
some
forty
thousand
crowns
or
fifty
thousand
for
something
we
have
here
and
it
must
be
that
wonder
of
the
loom
which
my
simone
has
lately
home
it
is
a
lucca
damask
the
web
is
silver
with
roses
since
you
did
offer
fifty
thousand
crowns
it
must
be
that
pray
wait
for
i
will
fetch
it
guido
nay
nay
thou
gracious
wonder
of
a
loom
more
cunning
far
than
those
of
lucca
i
had
in
my
thought
no
damask
silver
cloth
by
weavers
woven
toilsomely
if
such
are
priced
at
fifty
thousand
crowns
it
shames
me
for
i
hoped
to
buy
a
fabric
for
which
a
hundred
thousand
then
were
little
bianca
a
hundred
thousand
was
it
that
you
said
nay
poor
simone
for
so
great
a
sum
would
sell
you
everything
the
house
contains
the
thought
of
such
a
sum
doth
daze
the
brains
of
merchant
folk
who
live
such

thy
priceless
self
that
never
to
a
market
could
be
brought
no
more
than
winged
souls
that
sail
and
soar
among
the
planets
or
about
the
moon
bianca
it
is
so
much
thy
habit
to
buy
love
or
that
which
is
for
sale
and
labelled
love
hardly
couldst
thou
conceive
a
priceless
love
but
though
my
love
has
never
been
for
sale
i
have
been
in
a
market
bought
and
sold

this
is
some
riddle

thy

reads
to
baffle
mine

mock
me

again
bianca
my
marriage
sir
i
speak
of
marriage

common
market
where
my
husband
went
and
prides
himself

made
a
bargain

guido
the
wretched
chapman
how
i
hate
his
soul
bianca
he
was
a
better
bidder
than
thyself
and
knew
with
whom
to
deal
he
did
not
speak
of
gold
to
me
but
in
my
father
s
ear
he
made
it
clink
to
me
he
spoke
of
love
honest
and
free
and
open
without
price
guido
o
white
bianca
lovely
as
the
moon
the
light
of
thy
pure

shining

shows
me
my
shame
and
makes
the

i
was
slink
like
a
shadow
from
the

let
that
which
casts
the
shadow
act
my
lord
and
waste
no
thought
on
what
its
shadow
does
or
has
done
are
youth
and
strength
and
love
balked
by
mere
shadows
so
that
they
forget
themselves
so
far
they
can
not

my

guido
o
sweet
bianca
how
can
i
leave
thee
now
thy
beauty
made
two
captives
of
my
eyes
and
they
were
mad
to
feast
them
on
thy
form
but
now
thy
wit
the
liberated
perfume
of
a
bud
which
while
a
bud
seemed
perfect
but
now
is
that
which
can
make
its
former
self
forgot
how
can
i
leave
the
flower
who
loved
the
leaf
till
now
i
was
the
richest
prince
in
florence
i
am
a
lover
now
would
shun
its
throngs
and
put
away
all
state
and
seek
retreat
at
bellosguardo
or
fiesole
where
roses
in
their
fin
st
profusion
hide
some
marble
villa
whose
cool
walls
have
rung
a
laughing
echo
to
decameron
and
where
thy
laughter
shall
as
gaily
sound
say
thou
canst
love
or
with
a
silent
kiss
instil
that
balmy
knowledge
on
my
soul
bianca
canst
tell
me
what
love
is
guido
it
is
consent
the
union
of
two
minds
two
souls
two
hearts
in
all
they
think
and
hope
and
feel
bianca
such
lovers

as
well
be
dumb
for
those
who
think
and
hope
and
feel
alike

never
have
anything
for
one
another

guido
love
is
love
is
the
meeting
of
two
worlds
in
change

bianca
thus
will
my

praise
the
mercer

mart
where
the
two
worlds
of
east
and
west
exchange

my

calls
that
love
when
he
hath
slammed
his
weekly
ledger
to
guido
i
find
my
wit
no
better
match
for
thine
than
thou
art
match
for
an
old
crabbed
man
but
i
am
sure
my
youth
and
strength
and
blood
keep
better
tune
with
beauty
gay
and
bright
as
thine
is

lean
age
and

thee
more

owls
dare
face
the

s
the
bent
shadow
such
a
form
as
thine
might
cast
upon
a
dung
heap
by
the
road

should
it
fall
upon

floor
twould
be
at

a
better
man
than
he
guido
your
merchant
living
in
the
dread
of
loss
becomes
perforce
a
coward
eats
his
heart
dull
souls
they
are
who
like
caged
prisoners
watch
and
envy
others
joy
they
taste
no
food
but
what
its
cost
is
present
to
their
thought
bianca
i
am
my
father
s
daughter
in
his

a

who
has
been
taught
to
spin

never

i
have
a

which
makes
you
gallants
turn
where

i
pass
guido
thy
night
is
darker
than
i
dreamed
bright
star

he
waits
stands
by

mutters
to
himself
and
never
enters
with
a
frank
address
to
any
company
his
eyes
meet
mine
and
with
a
shudder
i
am
sure
he
counts
the
cost
of
what
i
wear
guido
forget
him
quite
come
come
escape
from
out
this
dismal
life
as
a
bright
butterfly
breaks
spider
s
web
and
nest
with
me
among
those
rosy
bowers
where
we
will
love
as
though
the
lives
we
led
till
yesterday
were
ghoulish
dreams
dispersed
by
the
great
dawn
of
limpid
joyous
life
bianca
will
i
not
come

make
no

come
they
waste
their

who
ponder

bad
dreams

will
away
to
hills
red
roses
clothe
and
though
the
persons
who
did
haunt
that
dream
live
on

shall
by

dwindled
seem
no
bigger
than
the

ear
of
corn
that
cowers
at
the
passing
of
a
bird
and
silent
shall
they
seem
out
of
those
voices
that
could
jar
while
we
gaze
back
from
rosy
caves
upon
the
open
and
ask
ourselves
if
what
we
see
is
not
a
picture
merely
dusty
dingy
lives
continue
there
to
choke
themselves
with
malice
wilt

this
pack

have
sold
nothing

a
furred
robe
unto
the
cardinal
s
son
who
hopes
to
wear
it
when
his
father
dies
and
hopes
that
will
be
soon
but
who
is
this
why
you
have
here
some
friend
some
kinsman
doubtless
newly
returned
from
foreign
lands
and
fallen
upon
a
house
without
a
host
to
greet
him
i
crave
your
pardon
kinsman
for
a
house
lacking
a
host
is
but
an
empty
thing
and
void
of
honour
a
cup
without
its
wine
a
scabbard
without
steel
to
keep
it
straight
a
flowerless
garden
widowed
of
the
sun
again
i
crave
your
pardon
my
sweet
cousin
bianca
this
is
no
kinsman
and
no
cousin
neither
simone
no
kinsman
and
no
cousin
you
amaze
me
who
is
it
then
who
with
such
courtly
grace
deigns
to
accept
our
hospitalities
guido
my
name
is
guido
bardi
simone
what
the
son
of
that
great
lord
of
florence
whose
dim
towers
like
shadows
silvered
by
the
wandering
moon
i
see
from
out
my
casement
every
night
sir
guido
bardi
you
are
welcome
here
twice
welcome
for
i
trust
my
honest
wife
most
honest
if
uncomely
to
the
eye
hath
not
with
foolish
chatterings
wearied
you
as
is
the
wont
of
women
guido
your
gracious
lady
whose
beauty
is
a
lamp
that
pales
the
stars
and
robs
diana
s
quiver
of
her
beams
has
welcomed
me
with
such
sweet
courtesies
that
if
it
be
her
pleasure
and
your
own
i
will
come
often
to
your
simple
house
and
when
your
business
bids
you
walk
abroad
i
will
sit
here
and
charm
her
loneliness
lest
she
might
sorrow
for
you
overmuch
what
say
you
good
simone
simone
my
noble
lord
you
bring
me
such
high
honour
that
my
tongue
like
a
slave
s
tongue
is
tied
and
can
not
say
the
word
it
would
yet
not
to
give
you
thanks
were
to
be
too
unmannerly
so
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
s
core
it
is
such
things
as
these
that
knit
a
state
together
when
a
prince
so
nobly
born
and
of
such
fair
address
forgetting
unjust
fortune
s
differences
comes
to
an
honest
burgher
s
honest
home
as
a
most
honest
friend
and
yet
my
lord
i
fear
i
am
too
bold
some
other
night
we
trust
that
you
will
come
here
as
a
friend
you
come
to
buy
my
merchandise
is
it
not
so
silks
velvets
what
you
will
i
doubt
not
but
i
have
some
dainty
wares
will
woo
your
fancy
true
the
hour
is
late
but
we
poor
merchants
toil
both
night
and
day
to
make
our
scanty
gains
the
tolls
are
high
and
every
city
levies
its
own
toll
and
prentices
are
unskilful
and
wives
even
lack
sense
and
cunning
though
bianca
here
has
brought
me
a
rich
customer
is
it
not
so
bianca
but
i
waste
time
where
is
my
pack
where
is
my
pack
i
say
open
it
my
good
wife
unloose
the
cords
kneel
down
upon
the
floor
you
are
better
so
nay
not
that
one
the
other
despatch
despatch
buyers
will
grow
impatient
oftentimes
we
dare
not
keep
them
waiting
ay
tis
that
give
it
to
me
with
care
it
is
most
costly
touch
it
with
care
and
now
my
noble
nay
pardon
i
have
here
a
lucca
damask
the
very
web
of
silver
and
the
roses
so
cunningly
wrought
that
they
lack
perfume
merely
to
cheat
the
wanton
sense
touch
it
my
lord
is
it
not
soft
as
water
strong
as
steel
and
then
the
roses
are
they
not
finely
woven
i
think
the
hillsides
that
best
love
the
rose
at
bellosguardo
or
at
fiesole
throw
no
such
blossoms
on
the
lap
of
spring
or
if
they
do
their
blossoms
droop
and
die
such
is
the
fate
of
all
the
dainty
things
that
dance
in
wind
and
water
nature
herself
makes
war
on
her
own
loveliness
and
slays
her
children
like
medea
nay
but
my
lord
look
closer
still
why
in
this
damask
here
it
is
summer
always
and
no
winter
s
tooth
will
ever
blight
these
blossoms
for
every
ell
i
paid
a
piece
of
gold
red
gold
and
good
the
fruit
of
careful
thrift
guido
honest
simone
enough
i
pray
you
i
am
well
content
i
will
send
my
servant
to
you
who
will
pay
twice
your
price
simone
my
generous
prince
i
kiss
your
hands
and
now
i
do
remember
another
treasure
hidden
in
my
house
which
you
must
see
it
is
a
robe
of
state
woven
by
a
venetian
the
stuff
the
pattern
pomegranates
each
separate
seed
wrought
of
a
pearl
the
collar
all
of
pearls
as
thick
as
moths
in
summer
streets
at
night
and
whiter
than
the
moons
that
madmen
see
through
prison
bars
at
morning
a
male
ruby
burns
like
a
lighted
coal
within
the
clasp
the
holy
father
has
not
such
a
stone
nor
could
the
indies
show
a
brother
to
it
the
brooch
itself
is
of
most
curious
art
cellini
never
made
a
fairer
thing
to
please
the
great
lorenzo
you
must
wear
it
there
is
none
worthier
in
our
city
here
and
it
will
suit
you
well
upon
one
side
a
slim
and
horned
satyr
leaps
in
gold
to
catch
some
nymph
of
silver
upon
the
other
stands
silence
with
a
crystal
in
her
hand
no
bigger
than
the
smallest
ear
of
corn
that
wavers
at
the
passing
of
a
bird
and
yet
so
cunningly
wrought
that
one
would
say
it
breathed
or
held
its
breath
worthy
bianca
would
not
this
noble
and
most
costly
robe
suit
young
lord
guido
well
nay
but
entreat
him
he
will
refuse
you
nothing
though
the
price
be
as
a
prince
s
ransom
and
your
profit
shall
not
be
less
than
mine
bianca
am
i
your
prentice
why
should
i
chaffer
for
your
velvet
robe
guido
nay
fair
bianca
i
will
buy
the
robe
and
all
things
that
the
honest
merchant
has
i
will
buy
also
princes
must
be
ransomed
and
fortunate
are
all
high
lords
who
fall
into
the
white
hands
of
so
fair
a
foe
simone
i
stand
rebuked
but
you
will
buy
my
wares
will
you
not
buy
them
fifty
thousand
crowns
would
scarce
repay
me
but
you
my
lord
shall
have
them
for
forty
thousand
is
that
price
too
high
name
your
own
price
i
have
a
curious
fancy
to
see
you
in
this
wonder
of
the
loom
amidst
the
noble
ladies
of
the
court
a
flower
among
flowers
they
say
my
lord
these
highborn
dames
do
so
affect
your
grace
that
where
you
go
they
throng
like
flies
around
you
each
seeking
for
your
favour
i
have
heard
also
of
husbands
that
wear
horns
and
wear
them
bravely
a
fashion
most
fantastical
guido
simone
your
reckless
tongue
needs
curbing
and
besides
you
do
forget
this
gracious
lady
here
whose
delicate
ears
are
surely
not
attuned
to
such
coarse
music
simone
true
i
had
forgotten
nor
will
offend
again
yet
my
sweet
lord
you
ll
buy
the
robe
of
state
will
you
not
buy
it
but
forty
thousand

a
trifle

heir

thing
with
my
steward
antonio
costa
he
will
come
to
you
and
you

a
hundred
thousand

purpose

and
gardens

pearls
that
the
arabian
seas
store
in
their
silent
caverns
generous
prince
this
night
shall
prove
the
herald
of
my
love
which
is
so
great
that
whatsoe
er
you
ask
it
will
not
be
denied
you
guido
what
if
i
asked
for
white
bianca
here
simone
you
jest
my
lord
she
is
not
worthy
of
so
great
a
prince
she
is
but
made
to
keep
the
house
and
spin
is
it
not
so
good
wife
it
is
so
look
your
distaff
waits
for
you
sit
down
and
spin
women
should
not
be
idle
in
their
homes
for
idle
fingers
make
a
thoughtless
heart
sit
down
i
say
bianca
what
shall
i
spin
simone
oh
spin
some
robe
which
dyed
in
purple
sorrow
might
wear
for
her
own
comforting
or
some
cloth
in
which
a
and
unwelcome
babe
might
wail
unheeded
or
a
dainty
sheet
which
delicately
perfumed
with
sweet
herbs
might
serve
to
wrap
a
dead
man
spin
what
you
will
i
care
not
bianca
the
brittle
thread
is
broken
the
dull
wheel
wearies
of
its
ceaseless
round
the
duller
distaff
sickens
of
its
load
i
will
not
spin
simone
it
matters
not
you
shall
spin
and
every
day
shall
find
you
at
your
distaff
so
lucretia
was
found
by
tarquin
so
perchance
lucretia
waited
for
tarquin
who
knows
i
have
heard
strange
things
about
men
s
wives
and
now
my
lord
what
news
abroad
i
heard
at
pisa
that
certain
of
the
english
merchants
there
would
sell
their
woollens
at
a
lower
rate
than
the
just
laws
allow
and
have
entreated
the
signory
to
hear
them
is
this
well
should
merchant
be
to
merchant
as
a
wolf
and
should
the
stranger
living
in
our
land
seek
by
enforced
privilege
or
craft
to
rob
us
of
our
profits
guido
what
should
i
do
with
merchants
or
their
profits
shall
i
go
and
wrangle
with
the
signory
on
your
count
and
wear
the
gown
in
which
you
buy
from
fools
or
sell
to
sillier
bidders
honest
simone
or
is
for
you
my
wits
have
other
quarries
bianca
noble
lord
i
pray
you
pardon
my
good
husband
here
his
soul
stands
ever
in
the
and
his
heart
beats
but
at
the
price
of
wool
yet
he
is
honest
in
his
common
way
simone
and
you
have
you
no
shame
a
gracious
prince
comes
to
our
house
and
you
must
weary
him
with
most
misplaced
assurance
ask
his
pardon
simone
i
ask
it
humbly
we
will
talk
of
other
things
i
hear
the
holy
father
has
sent
a
letter
to
the
king
of
france
bidding
him
cross
that
shield
of
snow
the
alps
and
make
a
peace
in
italy
which
will
be
worse
than
a
war
of
brothers
and
more
bloody
than
civil
rapine
or
intestine
feuds
guido
oh
we
are
weary
of
that
king
of
france
who
never
comes
but
ever
talks
of
coming
what
are
these
things
to
me
there
are
other
things
closer
and
of
more
import
good
simone
bianca
i
think
you
tire
our
most
gracious
guest
what
is
the
king
of
france
to
us
as
much
as
are
your
english
merchants
with
their
wool
simone
is
it
so
then
is
all
this
mighty
world
narrowed
into
the
confines
of
this
room
with
but
three
souls
for
poor
inhabitants
ay
there
are
times
when
the
great
universe
like
cloth
in
some
unskilful
dyer
s
vat
shrivels
into
a
handbreadth
and
perchance
that
time
is
now
well
let
that
time
be
now
let
this
mean
room
be
as
that
mighty
stage
whereon
kings
die
and
our
ignoble
lives
become
the
stakes
god
plays
for
i
do
not
know
why
i
speak
thus
my
ride
has
wearied
me
and
my
horse
stumbled
thrice
which
is
an
omen
that
bodes
not
good
to
any
alas
my
lord
how
poor
a
bargain
is
this
life
of
man
and
in
how
mean
a
market
are
we
sold
when
we
are
born
our
mothers
weep
but
when
we
die
there
is
none
weeps
for
us
no
not
one
to
back
of
bianca
how
like
a
common
chapman
does
he
speak
i
hate
him
soul
and
body
cowardice
has
set
her
pale
seal
on
his
brow
his
hands
whiter
than
poplar
leaves
in
windy
springs
shake
with
some
palsy
and
his
stammering
mouth
blurts
out
a
foolish
froth
of
empty
words
like
water
from
a
conduit
guido
sweet
bianca
he
is
not
worthy
of
your
thought
or
mine
the
man
is
but
a
very
honest
knave
full
of
fine
phrases
for
life
s
merchandise
selling
most
dear
what
he
must
hold
most
cheap
a
windy
brawler
in
a
world
of
words
i
never
met
so
eloquent
a
fool
bianca
oh
would
that
death
might
take
him
where
he
stands
simone
who
spake
of
death
let
no
one
speak
of
death
what
should
death
do
in
such
a
merry
house
with
but
a
wife
a
husband
and
a
friend
to
give
it
greeting
let
death
go
to
houses
where
there
are
vile
adulterous
things
chaste
wives
who
growing
weary
of
their
noble
lords
draw
back
the
curtains
of
their
marriage
beds
and
in
polluted
and
dishonoured
sheets
feed
some
unlawful
lust
ay
tis
so
strange
and
yet
so
do
not
know
the
world
are
too
single
and
too
honourable
i
know
it
well
and
would
it
were
not
so
but
wisdom
comes
with
winters
my
hair
grows
grey
and
youth
has
left
my
body
enough
of
that
is
ripe
for
pleasure
and
indeed
i
would
be
merry
as
beseems
a
host
who
finds
a
gracious
and
guest
waiting
to
greet
him
up
a
but
what
is
this
my
lord
why
you
have
brought
a
lute
to
play
to
us
oh
play
sweet
prince
and
if
i
am
too
bold
pardon
but
play
guido
i
will
not
play
some
other
night
simone
bianca
you
and
i
together
with
no
listeners
but
the
stars
or
the
more
jealous
moon
simone
nay
but
my
lord
nay
but
i
do
beseech
you
for
i
have
heard
that
by
the
simple
fingering
of
a
string
or
delicate
breath
breathed
along
hollowed
reeds
or
blown
into
cold
mouths
of
cunning
bronze
those
who
are
curious
in
this
art
can
draw
poor
souls
from
i
have
heard
also
how
such
strange
magic
lurks
within
these
shells
that
at
their
bidding
casements
open
wide
and
innocence
puts
in
her
hair
and
wantons
like
a
mænad
let
that
pass
your
lute
i
know
is
chaste
and
therefore
play
ravish
my
ears
with
some
sweet
melody
my
soul
is
in
a
and
needs
music
to
cure
its
madness
good
bianca
entreat
our
guest
to
play
bianca
be
not
afraid
our
guest
will
choose
his
place
and
moment
that
moment
is
not
now
you
weary
him
with
your
uncouth
insistence
guido
honest
simone
some
other
night
i
am
content
with
the
low
music
of
bianca
s
voice
who
when
she
speaks
charms
the
too
amorous
air
and
makes
the
reeling
earth
stand
still
or
fix
his
cycle
round
her
beauty
simone
you
flatter
her
she
has
her
virtues
as
most
women
have
but
beauty
in
a
gem
she
may
not
wear
it
is
better
so
perchance
well
my
dear
lord
if
you
will
not
draw
melodies
from
your
lute
to
charm
my
moody
and
o
soul
you
ll
drink
with
me
at
least
guido
his
own
your
place
is
laid
fetch
me
a
stool
bianca
close
the
shutters
set
the
great
bar
across
i
would
not
have
the
curious
world
with
its
small
prying
eyes
to
peer
upon
our
pleasure
now
my
lord
give
us
a
toast
from
a
full
brimming
cup
what
is
this
stain
upon
the
cloth
it
looks
as
purple
as
a
wound
upon
christ
s
side
wine
merely
is
it
i
have
heard
it
said
when
wine
is
spilt
blood
is
spilt
also
but
that
s
a
foolish
tale
my
lord
i
trust
my
grape
is
to
your
liking
the
wine
of
naples
is
fiery
like
its
mountains
our
tuscan
vineyards
yield
a
more
wholesome
juice
guido
i
like
it
well
honest
simone
and
with
your
good
leave
will
toast
the
fair
bianca
when
her
lips
have
like
red
floated
on
this
cup
and
left
its
vintage
sweeter
taste
bianca
bianca
oh
all
the
honey
of
hyblean
bees
matched
with
this
draught
were
bitter
good
simone
you
do
not
share
the
feast
simone
it
is
strange
my
lord
i
can
not
eat
or
drink
with
you
some
humour
or
some
fever
in
my
blood
at
other
seasons
temperate
or
some
thought
that
like
an
adder
creeps
from
point
to
point
that
like
a
madman
crawls
from
cell
to
cell
poisons
my
palate
and
makes
appetite
a
loathing
not
a
longing
guido
sweet
bianca
this
common
chapman
wearies
me
with
words
i
must
go
hence
i
will
come
tell
me
the
hour
bianca
come
with
the
youngest
dawn
until
i
see
you
all
my
life
is
vain
guido
ah
loose
the
falling
midnight
of
your
hair
and
in
those
stars
your
eyes
let
me
behold
mine
image
as
in
mirrors
dear
bianca
though
it
be
but
a
shadow
keep
me
there
nor
gaze
at
anything
that
does
not
show
some
symbol
of
my
semblance
i
am
jealous
of
what
your
vision
feasts
on
bianca
oh
be
sure
your
image
will
be
with
me
always
dear
love
can
translate
the
very
meanest
thing
into
a
sign
of
sweet
remembrances
but
come
before
the
lark
with
its
shrill
song
has
waked
a
world
of
dreamers
i
will
stand
upon
the
balcony
guido
and
by
a
ladder
wrought
out
of
scarlet
silk
and
sewn
with
pearls
will
come
to
meet
me
white
foot
after
foot
like
snow
upon
a
bianca
as
you
will
you
know
that
i
am
yours
for
love
or
death
guido
simone
i
must
go
to
mine
own
house
simone
so
soon
why
should
you
the
great
duomo
s
bell
has
not
yet
tolled
its
midnight
and
the
watchmen
who
with
their
hollow
horns
mock
the
pale
moon
lie
drowsy
in
their
towers
stay
awhile
i
fear
we
may
not
see
you
here
again
and
that
fear
saddens
my
too
simple
heart
guido
be
not
afraid
simone
i
will
stand
most
constant
in
my
friendship
but
i
go
to
mine
own
home
and
that
at
once
sweet
bianca
simone
well
well
so
be
it
i
would
have
wished
for
fuller
converse
with
you
my
new
friend
my
honourable
guest
but
that
it
seems
may
not
be
and
besides
i
do
not
doubt
your
father
waits
for
you
wearying
for
voice
or
footstep
you
i
think
are
his
one
child
he
has
no
other
child
you
are
the
gracious
pillar
of
his
house
the
flower
of
a
garden
full
of
weeds
your
father
s
nephews
do
not
love
him
well
so
run
folks
tongues
in
florence
i
meant
but
that
men
say
they
envy
your
inheritance
and
look
upon
your
vineyards
with
fierce
eyes
as
ahab
looked
on
naboth
s
goodly
field
but
that
is
but
the
chatter
of
a
town
where
women
talk
too
much
my
lord
fetch
a
pine
torch
bianca
the
old
staircase
is
full
of
pitfalls
and
the
churlish
moon
grows
like
a
miser
niggard
of
her
beams
and
hides
her
face
behind
a
muslin
mask
as
harlots
do
when
they
go
forth
to
snare
some
wretched
soul
in
sin
now
i
will
get
your
cloak
and
sword
nay
pardon
my
good
lord
it
is
but
meet
that
i
should
wait
on
you
who
have
so
honoured
my
poor
burgher
s
house
drunk
of
my
wine
and
broken
bread
and
made
yourself
a
sweet
familiar
oftentimes
my
wife
and
i
will
talk
of
this
fair
night
and
its
great
issues
why
what
a
sword
is
this
ferrara
s
temper
pliant
as
a
snake
and
deadlier
i
doubt
not
with
such
steel
one
need
fear
nothing
in
the
moil
of
life
i
never
touched
so
delicate
a
blade
i
have
a
sword
too
somewhat
rusted
now
we
men
of
peace
are
taught
humility
and
to
bear
many
burdens
on
our
backs
and
not
to
murmur
at
an
unjust
world
and
to
endure
unjust
indignities
we
are
taught
that
and
like
the
patient
jew
find
profit
in
our
pain
yet
i
remember
how
once
upon
the
road
to
padua
a
robber
sought
to
take
my
from
me
i
slit
his
throat
and
left
him
i
can
bear
dishonour
public
insult
many
shames
shrill
scorn
and
open
contumely
but
he
who
filches
from
me
something
that
is
mine
ay
though
it
be
the
meanest
from
which
i
feed
mine
he
perils
his
soul
and
body
in
the
theft
and
dies
for
his
small
sin
from
what
strange
clay
we
men
are
moulded
guido
why
do
you
speak
like
this
simone
i
wonder
my
lord
guido
if
my
sword
is
better
tempered
than
this
steel
of
yours
shall
we
make
trial
or
is
my
state
too
low
for
you
to
cross
your
rapier
against
mine
in
jest
or
earnest
guido
naught
would
please
me
better
than
to
stand
fronting
you
with
naked
blade
in
jest
or
earnest
give
me
mine
own
sword
fetch
yours
will
settle
the
great
issue
whether
the
prince
s
or
the
merchant
s
steel
is
better
tempered
was
not
that
your
word
fetch
your
own
sword
why
do
you
tarry
sir
simone
my
lord
of
all
the
gracious
courtesies
that
you
have
showered
on
my
barren
house

is
the
highest
bianca

my
sword

stool
and
table

must
have
an
open
circle
for
our
match

hold
the
torch
